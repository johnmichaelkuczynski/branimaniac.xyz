    description: "Fundamental Ideas, colligation of facts, and consilience as the supreme test of truth.",
    questions: [
      "If scientific laws express necessary relations grounded in a priori ideas, how can we be sure these Fundamental Ideas are truths about the world itself?",
      "You describe discovery as a creative colligation of facts. By what criterion can we distinguish a true colligation from an elegant but false synthesis?",
      "You hold consilience as the supreme test of a theory. But could not an incorrect theory also achieve consilience by forcing phenomena into its framework?",
      "You contend there is no theory-free observation. Does this not risk making science a closed system where our ideas merely rediscover themselves?",
      "You attribute great inductions to a cultivated tact akin to genius. Does this not render the logic of discovery ineffable and unteachable?"
    ]

  {
    topic: "Theology and Moral Philosophy",
    description: "Inductive theology, moral truth as necessary, and the harmony of science and religion.",
    questions: [
      "You present the argument from design as a robust induction. Can the inference to a transcendent intelligent Cause truly possess the same logical force as natural inferences?",
      "You claim moral principles are necessary truths like mathematics. Yet moral disagreement is widespread. Does this not weaken the claim to their self-evident character?",
      "If morality is a deductive system from a Supreme Rule, how do you address moral dilemmas where derived duties seem to conflict?",
      "By assigning science to Material causes and religion to Final causes, do you not grant science sovereignty over all explanatory realms of how things operate?",
      "Your theological argument against extraterrestrial life hinges on the uniqueness of Christ's incarnation. Does this not make doctrine the limiting principle for science?"

  {
    topic: "History of Science",
    description: "Scientific revolutions as Epochs of Discovery and the historical nature of scientific progress.",
    questions: [
      "If the history of science is the induction of the human race, does this not imply a teleology leading toward predetermined truths?",
      "In identifying Epochs defined by a great mind's colligation, do you not risk a Great Man theory of history?",
      "You champion controversy as the engine of progress. How do we distinguish productive from degenerative controversy?",
      "You propose using history as the data set for philosophy of science. How does one extract general normative rules without doing violence to the historical record?",
      "You state that instruments embody theoretical ideas. Does the arrow of causality not often point the other way, with instruments creating new facts?"
