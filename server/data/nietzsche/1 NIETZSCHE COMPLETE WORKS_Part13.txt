too well off not to ask for more and more, not to ask more immodestly. In the

end, he has numbers on his side. The hope is gone forever that a modest and

self-sufficient kind of man, a Chinese type, might here develop as a class: and

there would have been reason in that, it would almost have been a necessity.

But what was done? Everything to nip in the bud even the preconditions for

this: the instincts by virtue of which the worker becomes possible as a class,

possible in his own eyes, have been destroyed through and through with the

most  irresponsible  thoughtlessness.  The  worker  was  qualified  for  military

service, granted the right to organize and to vote: is it any wonder that the

worker today experiences his own existence as distressing--morally speaking,

as an injustice? But what is wanted? I ask once more. If one wants an end,

one must also want the means: if one wants slaves, then one is a fool if one

educates them to be masters. 41 "Freedom which I do not mean." -- In times

like these, abandonment to one's instincts is one calamity more. Our instincts

contradict, disturb, destroy each other; I have a ready defined what is modern

as  physiological  self-contradiction.  Rationality  in  education  would  require

that under iron pressure at least one of these instinct systems be paralyzed to

permit another to gain in power, to become strong, to become master. Today

the individual still has to be made possible by being pruned: possible here

means whole. The reverse is what happens: the claim for independence, for

free development, for laisser aller is pressed most hotly by the very people

for whom no reins would be too strict. This is true in politics, this is true in

art. But that is a symptom of decadence: our modern conception of "freedom"

is one more proof of the degeneration of the instincts. 42 Where faith is

needed. -- Nothing is rarer among moralists and saints than honesty. Perhaps

they say the contrary, perhaps they even believe it. For when a faith is more

useful, more effective, and more persuasive than conscious hypocrisy, then

hypocrisy  soon  turns  instinctively  into  innocence:  first  principle  for  the

understanding of great saints. The philosophers are merely another kind of

saint, and their whole craft is such that they admit only certain truths--namely

those for the sake of which their craft is accorded public sanction--in Kantian

terms, truths of practical reason. They know what they must prove; in this

they are practical. They recognize each other by their agreement about "the

truths." "Thou shalt not lie": in other words, beware, my dear philosopher, of

telling the truth. 43 Whispered to the conservatives. -- What was not known

formerly, what is known, or might be known, today: a reversion, a return in

any sense or degree is simply not possible. We physiologists know that. Yetall  priests  and  moralists  have  believed  the  opposite--they  wanted  to  take

mankind back, to screw it back, to a former measure of virtue. Morality was

always a bed of Procrustes. Even the politicians have aped the preachers of

virtue at this point: today too there are still parties whose dream it is that all

things might walk backwards like crabs. But no one is free to be a crab.

Nothing avails: one must go forward--step by step further into decadence

(that is my definition of modern "progress"). One can check this development

and thus dam up degeneration, gather it and make it more vehement and

sudden: one can do no more. 44 My conception of genius. -- Great men, like

great ages, are explosives in which a tremendous force is stored up; their

precondition is always, historically and physiologically, that for a long time

much has been gathered, stored up, saved up, and conserved for them--that

there has been no explosion for a long time. Once the tension in the mass has

become too great, then the most accidental stimulus suffices to summon into

the  world  the  "genius,"  the  "deed,"  the  great  destiny.  What  does  the

environment matter then, or the age, or the "spirit of the age," or "public

opinion"! Take the case of Napoleon. Revolutionary France, and even more,

prerevolutionary France, would have brought forth the opposite type; in fact,

it did. Because Napoleon was different, the heir of a stronger, older, more

ancient  civilization  than  the  one  which  was  then  perishing  in  France,  he

became the master there, he was the only master. Great men are necessary,

the age in which they appear is accidental; that they almost always become

masters over their age is only because they are stronger, because they are

older,  because  for  a  longer  time  much  was  gathered  for  them.  The

relationship between a genius and his age is like that between strong and

weak, or between old and young: the age is relatively always much younger,

thinner, more immature, less assured, more childish. That in France today

they think quite differently on this subject (in Germany too, but that does not

matter), that the milieu theory, which is truly a neurotic's theory, has become

sacrosanct  and  almost  scientific  and  has  found  adherents  even  among

physiologists--that "smells bad" and arouses sad reflections. It is no different

in England, but that will not grieve anybody. For the English there are only

two ways of coming to terms with the genius and the "great man": either

democratically  in  the  manner  of  Buckle  or  religiously  in  the  manner  of

Carlyle.  The  danger  that  lies  in  great  men  and  ages  is  extraordinary;

exhaustion of every kind, sterility, follow in their wake. The great human

being is a finale; the great age--the Renaissance, for example--is a finale. Thegenius,  in  work  and  deed,  is  necessarily  a  squanderer:  that  he  squanders

himself, that is his greatness! The instinct of self-preservation is suspended,

as it were: the overpowering pressure of outflowing forces forbids him any

such care or caution. People call this "self-sacrifice" and praise his "heroism,"

his indifference to his own well-being, his devotion to an idea, a great cause,

a  fatherland:  without  exception,  misunderstandings.  He  flows  out,  he

overflows,  he  uses  himself  up,  he  does  not  spare  himself--and  this  is  a

calamitous involuntary fatality, no less than a river's flooding the land. Yet,

because much is owed to such explosives, much has also been given them in

return: for example, a kind of higher morality. After all, that is the way of

human gratitude: it misunderstands its benefactors. 45 The criminal and what

is related to him. -- The criminal type is the type of the strong human being

under unfavorable circumstances: a strong human being made sick. He lacks

the wilderness, a somehow freer and more dangerous environment and form

of existence, where everything that is weapons and armor in the instinct of

the strong human being has its rightful place. His virtues are ostracized by

society; the most vivid drives with which he is endowed soon grow together

with the depressing affects--with suspicion, fear, and dishonor. Yet this is

almost the recipe for physiological degeneration. Whoever must do secretly,

with long suspense, caution, and cunning, what he can do best and would like

most to do, becomes anemic; and because he always harvests only danger,

persecution, and calamity from his instincts, his attitude to these instincts is

reversed too, and he comes to experience them fatalistically. It is society, our

tame, mediocre, emasculated society, in which a natural human being, who

comes from the mountains or from the adventures of the sea, necessarily

degenerates  into  a  criminal.  Or  almost  necessarily;  for  there  are  cases  in

which such a man proves stronger than society: the Corsican, Napoleon, is

the  most  famous  case.  The  testimony  of  Dostoevski  is  relevant  to  this

problem--Dostoevski, the only psychologist, incidentally, from whom I had

something to learn; he ranks among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in

my life, even more than my discovery of Stendhal. This profound human

being, who was ten times right in his low estimate of the superficial Germans,

lived for a long time among the convicts in Siberia--hardened criminals for

whom there was no way back to society--and found them very different from

what he himself had expected: they were carved out of just about the best,

hardest, and most valuable wood that grows anywhere on Russian soil. Let us

generalize the case of the criminal: let us think of men so constituted that forone reason or another, they lack public approval and know that they are not

felt to be beneficent or useful--that chandala feeling that one is not considered

equal, but an outcast, unworthy, contaminating. All men so constituted have a

subterranean  hue  to  their  thoughts  and  actions;  everything  about  them

becomes  paler  than  in  those  whose  existence  is  touched  by  daylight.  Yet

almost all forms of existence which we consider distinguished today once

lived in this half tomblike atmosphere: the scientific character, the artist, the

genius, the free spirit, the actor, the merchant, the great discoverer. As long as

the priest was considered the supreme type, every valuable kind of human

being was devaluated. The time will come, I promise, when the priest will be

considered  the  lowest  type,  our  chandala  the  most  mendacious,  the  most

indecent kind of human being. I call attention to the fact that even now--

under the mildest regimen of morals which has ever ruled on earth, or at least

in  Europe--every  deviation,  every  long,  all-too-long  sojourn  below,  every

unusual or opaque form of existence, brings one closer to that type which is

perfected in the criminal. All innovators of the spirit must for a time bear the

pallid and fatal mark of the chandala on their foreheads--not because they are

considered that way by others, but because they themselves feel the terrible

cleavage  which  separates  them  from  everything  that  is  customary  or

reputable. Almost every genius knows, as one stage of his development, the

"Catilinarian existence"--a feeling of hatred, revenge, and rebellion against

everything which already is, which no longer becomes. Catiline--the form of

pre-existence of every Caesar. 46 Here the view is free. -- It may be nobility

of the soul when a philosopher is silent, it may be love when he contradicts

himself; and he who has knowledge maybe polite enough to lie. It has been

said, not without delicacy: II est indigne des grand coeurs de repandre le

trouble  qu'ils  ressentent  [It  is  unworthy  of  great  hearts  to  pour  out  the

disturbance they feel]. But one must add that not to be afraid of the most

unworthy may also be greatness of soul. A woman who loves, sacrifices her

honor; a knower who "loves" may perhaps sacrifice his humanity; a God who

loved became a Jew. 47 Beauty no accident. -- The beauty of a race or a

family, their grace and graciousness in all gestures, is won by work: like

genius, it is the end result of the accumulated work of generations. One must

have  made  great  sacrifices  to  good  taste,  one  must  have  done  much  and

omitted much, for its sake--seventeenth-century France is admirable in both

respects--and  good  taste  must  have  furnished  a  principle  for  selecting

company, place, dress, sexual satisfaction; one must have preferred beauty toadvantage,  habit,  opinion,  and  inertia.  Supreme  rule  of  conduct:  before

oneself too, one must not "let oneself go." The good things are immeasurably

costly; and the law always holds that those who have them are different from

those  who  acquire  them.  All  that  is  good  is  inherited:  whatever  is  not

inherited is imperfect, is a mere beginning. In Athens, in the time of Cicero

(who expresses his surprise about this), the men and youths were far superior

in beauty to the women. But what work and exertion in the service of beauty

had the male sex there imposed on itself for centuries! For one should make

no mistake about the method in this case: a breeding of feelings and thoughts

alone  is  almost  nothing  (this  is  the  great  misunderstanding  underlying

German  education,  which  is  wholly  illusory),  one  must  first  persuade  the

body. Strict perseverance in significant and exquisite gestures together with

the obligation to live only with people who do not "let themselves go"--that is

quite enough for one to become significant and exquisite, and in two or three

generations all this becomes inward. It is decisive for the lot of a people and

of humanity that culture should begin in the right place--not in the "soul" (as

was the fateful superstition of the priests and half-priests): the right place is

the  body,  the  gesture,  the  diet,  physiology;  the  rest  follows  from  that.

Therefore the Greeks remain the first cultural event in history: they knew,

they did, what was needed; and Christianity, which despised the body, has

been the greatest misfortune of humanity so far. 48 Progress in my sense. -- I

too speak of a "return to nature," although it is really not a going back but a

going up--an ascent to the high, free, even terrible nature and naturalness

where great tasks are something one plays with, one may play with. To put it

metaphorically: Napoleon was a piece of "return to nature," as I understand

the phrase (for example, in rebus tacticis; even more, as military men know,

in matters of strategy). But Rousseau--to what did he really want to return?

Rousseau, this first modern man, idealist and rabble in one person--one who

needed moral "dignity" to be able to stand his own sight, sick with unbridled

vanity  and  unbridled  self-contempt.  This  miscarriage,  couched  on  the

threshold of modern times, also wanted a "return to nature"; to ask this once

more,  to  what  did  Rousseau  want  to  return?  I  still  hate  Rousseau  in  the

French  Revolution:  it  is  the  world-historical  expression  of  this  duality  of

idealist  and  rabble.  The  bloody  farce  which  became  an  aspect  of  the

Revolution, its "immorality," is of little concern to me: what I hate is its

Rousseauan morality--the so-called "truths" of the Revolution through which

it still works and attracts everything shallow and mediocre. The doctrine ofequality! There is no more poisonous poison anywhere: for it seems to be

preached  by  justice  itself,  whereas  it  really  is  the  termination  of  justice.

"Equal to the equal, unequal to the unequal"--that would be the true slogan of

justice; and also its corollary: "Never make equal what is unequal." That this

doctrine of equality was surrounded by such gruesome and bloody events,

that has given this "modern idea" par excellence a kind of glory and fiery

aura  so  that  the  Revolution  as  a  spectacle  has  seduced  even  the  noblest

spirits. In the end, that is no reason for respecting it any more. I see only one

man who experienced it as it must be experienced, with nausea--Goethe. 49

Goethe--not a German event, but a European one: a magnificent attempt to

overcome the eighteenth century by a return to nature, by an ascent to the

naturalness of the Renaissance--a kind of self-overcoming on the part of that

century. He bore its strongest instincts within himself: the sensibility, the

idolatry of nature, the anti-historic, the idealistic, the unreal and revolutionary

(the latter being merely a form of the unreal). He sought help from history,

natural science, antiquity, and also Spinoza, but, above all, from practical

activity; he surrounded himself with limited horizons; he did not retire from

life but put himself into the midst of it; he if was not fainthearted but took as

much as possible upon himself, over himself, into himself. What he wanted

was totality; he fought the mutual extraneousness of reason, senses, feeling,

and  will  (preached  with  the  most  abhorrent  scholasticism  by  Kant,  the

antipode of Goethe); he disciplined himself to wholeness, he created himself.

In the middle of an age with an unreal outlook, Goethe was a convinced

realist: he said Yes to everything that was related to him in this respect--and

he had no greater experience than that ens realissimum [most real being]

called Napoleon. Goethe conceived a human being who would be strong,

highly educated, skillful in all bodily matters, self-controlled, reverent toward

himself, and who might dare to afford the whole range and wealth of being

natural, being strong enough for such freedom; the man of tolerance, not

from  weakness  but  from  strength,  because  he  knows  how  to  use  to  his

advantage even that from which the average nature would perish; the man for

whom there is no longer anything that is forbidden--unless it be weakness,

whether called vice or virtue. Such a spirit who has become free stands amid

the cosmos with a joyous and trusting fatalism, in the faith that only the

particular is loathesome, and that all is redeemed and affirmed in the whole--

he  does  not  negate  anymore.  Such  a  faith,  however,  is  the  highest  of  all

possible faiths: I have baptized it with the name of Dionysus. 50 One mightsay that in a certain sense the nineteenth century also strove for all that which

Goethe  as  a  person  had  striven  for:  universality  in  understanding  and  in

welcoming, letting everything come close to oneself, an audacious realism, a

reverence  for  everything  factual.  How  is  it  that  the  overall  result  is  no

Goethe, but a chaos, a nihilistic sigh, an utter bewilderment, an instinct of

weariness  which  in  practice  continually  drives  toward  a  recourse  to  the

eighteenth century? (For example, as a romanticism of feeling, as altruism

and hypersentimentality, as feminism in taste, as socialism in politics.) Is not

the  nineteenth  century,  especially  at  its  close,  merely  an  intensified,

brutalized eighteenth century, that is, a century of decadence? So that Goethe

would have been--not merely for Germany, but for all of Europe--a mere

interlude, a beautiful "in vain"? But one misunderstands great human beings

if one views them from the miserable perspective of some public use. That

one cannot put them to any use, that in itself may belong to greatness. 51

Goethe is the last German for whom I feel any reverence: he would have felt

three things which I feel--we also understand each other about the "cross." I

am often asked why, after all, I write in German: nowhere am I read worse

than in the Fatherland. But who knows in the end whether I even wish to be

read today? To create things on which time tests its teeth in vain; in form, in

substance, to strive for a little immortality--I have never yet been modest

enough to demand less of myself. The aphorism, the apothegm, in which I am

the first among the Germans to be a master, are the forms of "eternity"; it is

my ambition to say in ten sentences what everyone else says in a book--what

everyone  else  does  not  say  in  a  book.  I  have  given  mankind  the  most

profound book it possesses, my Zarathustra; shortly I shall give it the most

independent.

                        WHAT I OWE TO THE ANCIENTS

  1 In conclusion, a word about that world to which I sought approaches, to

which I have perhaps found a new approach--the ancient world. My taste,

which may be the opposite of a tolerant taste, is in this case too far from

saying Yes indiscriminately: it does not like to say Yes; rather even No; but

best of all, nothing. That applies to whole cultures, it applies to books--also to

places and landscapes. At bottom it is a very small number of ancient books

that counts in my life; the most famous are not among them. My sense of

style, for the epigram as a style, was awakened almost instantly when I came

into contact with Sallust. I have not forgotten the surprise of my honored

teacher, Corssen, when he had to give his worst Latin pupil the best grade: Ihad finished with one stroke. Compact, severe, with as much substance as

possible,  a  cold  sarcasm  against  "beautiful  words"  and  "beautiful

sentiments"--here  I  found  myself.  And  even  in  my  Zarathustra  one  will

recognize a very serious ambition for a Roman style, for the aere perennius

[more enduring than bronze] in style. Nor was my experience any different in

my first contact with Horace. To this day, no other poet has given me the

same artistic delight that a Horatian ode gave me from the first. In certain

languages that which has been achieved here could not even be attempted.

This mosaic of words, in which every word--as sound, as place, as concept--

pours out its strength right and left and over the whole, this minimum in the

extent and number of the signs, and the maximum thereby attained in the

energy of the signs--all that is Roman and, if one will believe me, noble par

excellence.  All  the  rest  of  poetry  becomes,  in  contrast,  something  too

popular--a mere garrulity of feelings. 2 To the Greeks I do not by any means

owe similarly strong impressions; and--to come right out with it--they cannot

mean as much to us as the Romans. One does not learn from the Greeks--

their manner is too foreign, and too fluid, to have an imperative, a "classical"

effect. Who could ever have learned to write from a Greek? Who could ever

have learned it without the Romans? For heaven's sake, do not throw Plato at

me. I am a complete skeptic about Plato, and I have never been able to join in

the admiration for the artist Plato which is customary among scholars. In the

end, the subtlest judges of taste among the ancients themselves are here on

my side. Plato, it seems to me, throws all stylistic forms together and is thus a

first-rate decadent in style: his responsibility is thus comparable to that of the

Cynics, who invented the satura Menippea. To be attracted by the Platonic

dialogue, this horribly self-satisfied and childish kind of dialectic, one must

never  have  read  good  French  writers--Fontenelle,  for  example.  Plato  is

boring. In the end, my mistrust of Plato goes deep: he represents such an

aberration from all the basic instincts of the Hellene, is so moralistic, so pre-

existently  Christian--he  already  takes  the  concept  "good"  for  the  highest

concept--that for the whole phenomenon of Plato I would sooner use the

harsh phrase "higher swindle," or, if it sounds better, "idealism," than any

other. We have paid dearly for the fact that this Athenian got his schooling

from  the  Egyptians  (or  from  the  Jews  in  Egypt?).  In  that  great  calamity,

Christianity,  Plato  represents  that  ambiguity  and  fascination,  called  an

"ideal,"  which  made  it  possible  for  the  nobler  spirits  of  antiquity  to

misunderstand themselves and to set foot on the bridge leading to the cross.And  how  much  Plato  there  still  is  in  the  concept  "church,"  in  the

construction,  system,  and  practice  of  the  church!  My  recreation,  my

preference,  my  cure  from  all  Platonism  has  always  been  Thucydides.

Thucydides and, perhaps, Machiavelli's Principe are most closely related to

myself by the unconditional will not to gull oneself and to see reason in

reality--not  in  "reason,"  still  less  in  "morality."  For  the  wretched

embellishment of the Greeks into an ideal, which the "classically educated"

youth carries into life as a prize for his classroom drill, there is no more

complete cure than Thucydides. One must follow him line by line and read

no less clearly between the lines: there are few thinkers who say so much

between the lines. With him the culture of the Sophists, by which I mean the

culture  of  the  realists,  reaches  its  perfect  expression--this  inestimable

movement amid the moralistic and idealistic swindle set loose on all sides by

the Socratic schools. Greek philosophy: the decadence of the Greek instinct.

Thucydides: the great sum, the last revelation of that strong, severe, hard

factuality  which  was  instinctive  with  the  older  Hellenes.  In  the  end,  it  is

courage in the face of reality that distinguishes a man like Thucydides from

Plato: Plato is a coward before reality, consequently he flees into the ideal;

Thucydides has control of himself, consequently he also maintains control of

things.  3  To  smell  out  "beautiful  souls,"  "golden  means,"  and  other

perfections in the Greeks, or to admire their calm in greatness, their ideal cast

of mind, their noble simplicity--the psychologist in me protected me against

such "noble simplicity," a niaiserie allemande anyway. I saw their strongest

instinct, the will to power: I saw them tremble before the indomitable force of

this drive--I saw how all their institutions grew out of preventive measures

taken to protect each other against their inner explosives. This tremendous

inward tension then discharged itself in terrible and ruthless hostility to the

outside world: the city-states tore each other to pieces so that the citizens of

each might find peace from themselves. One needed to be strong: danger was

near,  it  lurked  everywhere.  The  magnificent  physical  suppleness,  the

audacious  realism  and  immoralism  which  distinguished  the  Hellene

constituted a need, not "nature." It only resulted, it was not there from the

start. And with festivals and the arts they also aimed at nothing other than to

feel  on  top,  to  show  themselves  on  top.  These  are  means  of  glorifying

oneself, and in certain cases, of inspiring fear of oneself. How could one

possibly judge the Greeks by their philosophers, as the Germans have done,

and use the Philistine moralism of the Socratic schools as a clue to what wasbasically  Hellenic!  After  all,  the  philosophers  are  the  decadents  of  Greek

culture, the counter-movement to the ancient, noble taste (to the agonistic

instinct, to the polis, to the value of race, to the authority of descent). The

Socratic virtues were preached because the Greeks had lost them: excitable,

timid, fickle comedians, every one of them, they had a few reasons too many

for having morals preached to them. Not that it did any good--but big words

and attitudes suit decadents so well. 4 I was the first to take seriously, for the

understanding  of  the  older,  the  still  rich  and  even  overflowing  Hellenic

instinct, that wonderful phenomenon which bears the name of Dionysus: it is

explicable only in terms of an excess of force. Whoever followed the Greeks,

like that most profound student of their culture in our time, Jacob Burckhardt

in Basel, knew immediately that something had been accomplished thereby;

and  Burckhardt  added  a  special  section  on  this  phenomenon  to  his

Civilization of the Greeks. To see the opposite, one should look at the almost

amusing  poverty  of  instinct  among  the  German  philologists  when  they

approach the Dionysian. The famous Lobeck, above all, crawled into this

world of mysterious states with all the venerable sureness of a worm dried up

between books, and persuaded himself that it was scientific of him to be glib

and childish to the point of nausea--and with the utmost erudition, Lobeck

gave  us  to  understand  that  all  these  curiosities  really  did  not  amount  to

anything. In fact, the priests could have told the participants in such orgies

some not altogether worthless things; for example, that wine excites lust, that

man can under certain circumstances live on fruit, that plants bloom in the

spring  and  wilt  in  the  fall.  As  regards  the  astonishing  wealth  of  rites,

symbols, and myths of an orgiastic origin, with which the ancient world is

literally  overrun,  this  gave  Lobeck  an  opportunity  to  become  still  more

ingenious.  "The  Greeks,"  he  said  (Aglaophamus  I,  672),  "when  they  had

nothing  else  to  do,  laughed,  jumped,  and  ran  around;  or,  since  man

sometimes feels that urge too, they sat down, cried, and lamented. Others

came later on and sought some reason for this spectacular behavior; and thus

there  originated,  as  explanations  for  these  customs,  countless  traditions

concerning feasts and myths. On the other hand, it was believed that this droll

ado, which took place on the feast days after all, must also form a necessary

part of the festival and therefore it was maintained as an indispensable feature

of the religious service." This is contemptible prattle; a Lobeck simply cannot

be taken seriously for a moment. We have quite a different feeling when we

examine the concept "Greek" which was developed by Winckelmann andGoethe, and find it incompatible with that element out of which Dionysian art

grows--the  orgiastic.  Indeed  I  do  not  doubt  that  as  a  matter  of  principle

Goethe excluded a thing of the sort from the possibilities of the Greek soul.

Consequently Goethe did not understand the Greeks. For it is only in the

Dionysian mysteries, in the psychology of the Dionysian state, that the basic

fact of the Hellenic instinct finds expression--its "will to life." What was it

that the Hellene guaranteed himself by means of these mysteries? Eternal life,

the eternal return of life, the future promised and hallowed in the past; the

triumphant Yes to life beyond all death and change; true life as the overall

continuation of life through procreation, through the mysteries of sexuality.

For the Greeks the sexual symbol was therefore the venerable symbol par

excellence, the real profundity in the whole of ancient piety. Every single

element  in  the  act  of  procreation,  of  pregnancy,  and  of  birth  aroused  the

highest and most solemn feelings. In the doctrine of the mysteries, pain is

pronounced holy: the pangs of the woman giving birth hallow all pain; all

becoming and growing--all that guarantees a future--involves pain. That there

may be the eternal joy of creating, that the will to life may eternally affirm

itself, the agony of the woman giving birth must also be there eternally. All

this is meant by the word Dionysus: I know no higher symbolism than this

Greek symbolism of the Dionysian festivals. Here the most profound instinct

of  life,  that  directed  toward  the  future  of  life,  the  eternity  of  life,  is

experienced religiously--and the way to life, procreation, as the holy way. It

was Christianity, with its ressentiment against life at the bottom of its heart,

which first made something unclean of sexuality: it threw filth on the origin,

on the presupposition of our life. 5 The psychology of the orgiastic as an

overflowing feeling of life and strength, where even pain still has the effect of

a stimulus, gave me the key to the concept of tragic feeling, which had been

misunderstood  both  by  Aristotle  and,  quite  especially,  by  our  modern

pessimists. Tragedy is so far from proving anything about the pessimism of

the  Hellenes,  in  Schopenhauer's  sense,  that  it  may,  on  the  contrary,  be

considered its decisive repudiation and counter-instance. Saying Yes to life

even in its strangest and hardest problems, the will to life rejoicing over its

own inexhaustibility even in the very sacrifice of its highest types--that is

what  I  called  Dionysian,  that  is  what  I  guessed  to  be  the  bridge  to  the

psychology of the tragic poet. Not in order to be liberated from terror and

pity, not in order to purge oneself of a dangerous affect by its vehement

discharge--Aristotle understood it that way--but in order to be oneself theeternal joy of becoming, beyond all terror and pity--that joy which included

even joy in destroying. And herewith I again touch that point from which I

once went forth: The Birth of Tragedy was my first revaluation of all values.

Herewith I again stand on the soil out of which my intention, my ability

grows--I, the last disciple of the philosopher Dionysus-I, the teacher of the

eternal recurrence.

                                  THE ANTICHRIST

                                    H. L. MENCKEN

                                      INTRODUCTION

  Save  for  his  raucous,  rhapsodical  autobiography,  "Ecce  Homo,"  "The

Antichrist"  is  the  last  thing  that  Nietzsche  ever  wrote,  and  so  it  may  be

accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form.

Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to have constituted

the first volume of his long-projected magnum opus, "The Will to Power."

His full plan for this work, as originally drawn up, was as follows:

  Vol. I. The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.

  Vol.  II.  The  Free  Spirit:  a  Criticism  of  Philosophy  as  a  Nihilistic

Movement.

  Vol. III. The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality, the Most Fatal Form of

Ignorance.

  Vol. IV. Dionysus: the Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence.

  The first sketches for "The Will to Power" were made in 1884, soon afterthe  publication  of  the  first  three  parts  of  "Thus  Spake  Zarathustra,"  and

thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up notes. They were written at all

the places he visited on his endless travels in search of health--at Nice, at

Venice,  at  Sils-Maria  in  the  Engadine  (for  long  his  favourite  resort),  at

Cannobio, at Z�rich, at Genoa, at Chur, at Leipzig. Several times his work

was interrupted by other books, first by "Beyond Good and Evil," then by

"The Genealogy of Morals" (written in twenty days), then by his Wagner

pamphlets. Almost as often he changed his plan. Once he decided to expand

"The  Will  to  Power"  to  ten  volumes,  with  "An  Attempt  at  a  New

Interpretation of the World" as a general sub-title. Again he adopted the sub-

title of "An Interpretation of All That Happens." Finally, he hit upon "An

Attempt at a Transvaluation of All Values," and went back to four volumes,

though with a number of changes in their arrangement. In September, 1888,

he began actual work upon the first volume, and before the end of the month

it was completed. The Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative

activity. Since the middle of June he had written two other small books, "The

Case of Wagner" and "The Twilight of the Idols," and before the end of the

year he was destined to write "Ecce Homo." Some time during December his

health began to fail rapidly, and soon after the New Year he was helpless.

Thereafter he wrote no more.

  The  Wagner  diatribe  and  "The  Twilight  of  the  Idols"  were  published

immediately, but "The Antichrist" did not get into type until 1895. I suspect

that the delay was due to the influence of the philosopher's sister, Elisabeth

Forster-Nietzsche,  an  intelligent  and  ardent  but  by  no  means  uniformly

judicious  propagandist  of  his  ideas.  During  his  dark  days  of  neglect  and

misunderstanding, when even family and friends kept aloof, Frau Forster-

Nietzsche  went  with  him  farther  than  any  other,  but  there  were  bounds

beyond which she, also, hesitated to go, and those bounds were marked by

crosses. One notes, in her biography of him--a useful but not always accurate

work--an evident desire to purge him of the accusation of mocking at sacred

things.  He  had,  she  says,  great  admiration  for  "the  elevating  effect  of

Christianity ... upon the weak and ailing," and "a real liking for sincere, pious

Christians," and "a tender love for the Founder of Christianity." All his wrath,

she continues, was reserved for "St. Paul and his like," who perverted the

Beatitudes, which Christ intended for the lowly only, into a universal religion

which made war upon aristocratic values. Here, obviously, one is addressed

by an interpreter who cannot forget that she is the daughter of a Lutheranpastor and the grand-daughter of two others; a touch of conscience gets into

her reading of "The Antichrist." She even hints that the text may have been

garbled, after the author's collapse, by some more sinister heretic. There is

not the slightest reason to believe that any such garbling ever took place, nor

is there any evidence that their common heritage of piety rested upon the

brother as heavily as it rested upon the sister. On the contrary, it must be

manifest that Nietzsche, in this book, intended to attack Christianity headlong

and with all arms, that for all his rapid writing he put the utmost care into it,

and that he wanted it to be printed exactly as it stands. The ideas in it were

anything but new to him when he set them down. He had been developing

them since the days of his beginning. You will find some of them, clearly

recognizable, in the first book he ever wrote, "The Birth of Tragedy." You

will find the most important of all of them--the conception of Christianity as

ressentiment--set  forth  at  length  in  the  first  part  of  "The  Genealogy  of

Morals,"  published  under  his  own  supervision  in  1887.  And  the  rest  are

scattered  through  the  whole  vast  mass  of  his  notes,  sometimes  as  mere

questionings but often worked out very carefully. Moreover, let it not be

forgotten  that  it  was  Wagner's  yielding  to  Christian  sentimentality  in

"Parsifal"  that  transformed  Nietzsche  from  the  first  among  his  literary

advocates into the most bitter of his opponents. He could forgive every other

sort of mountebankery, but not that. "In me," he once said, "the Christianity

of my forbears reaches its logical conclusion. In me the stern intellectual

conscience  that  Christianity  fosters  and  makes  paramount  turns  against

Christianity. In me Christianity ... devours itself."

  In truth, the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of the

whole of Nietzsche's system as the keystone is to the arch. All the curves of

his speculation lead up to it. What he flung himself against, from beginning

to end of his days of writing, was always, in the last analysis, Christianity in

some form or other--Christianity as a system of practical ethics, Christianity

as a political code, Christianity as metaphysics, Christianity as a gauge of the

truth. It would be difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long

list that did not, more or less directly and clearly, relate itself to this master

enterprise of them all. It was as if his apostasy from the faith of his fathers,

filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert, and particularly of the convert to

heresy, had blinded him to every other element in the gigantic self-delusion

of  civilized  man.  The  will  to  power  was  his  answer  to  Christianity's

affectation of humility and self-sacrifice; eternal recurrence was his mockingcriticism  of  Christian  optimism  and  millennialism;  the  superman  was  his

candidate for the place of the Christian ideal of the "good" man, prudently

abased before the throne of God. The things he chiefly argued for were anti-

Christian  things--the  abandonment  of  the  purely  moral  view  of  life,  the

rehabilitation  of  instinct,  the  dethronement  of  weakness  and  timidity  as

ideals, the renunciation of the whole hocus-pocus of dogmatic religion, the

extermination of false aristocracies (of the priest, of the politician, of the

plutocrat), the revival of the healthy, lordly "innocence" that was Greek. If he

was anything in a word, Nietzsche was a Greek born two thousand years too

late. His dreams were thoroughly Hellenic; his whole manner of thinking was

Hellenic; his peculiar errors were Hellenic no less. But his Hellenism, I need

not add, was anything but the pale neo-Platonism that has run like a thread

through the thinking of the Western world since the days of the Christian

Fathers. From Plato, to be sure, he got what all of us must get, but his real

forefather was Heraclitus. It is in Heraclitus that one finds the germ of his

primary  view  of  the  universe--a  view,  to  wit,  that  sees  it,  not  as  moral

phenomenon, but as mere aesthetic representation. The God that Nietzsche

imagined, in the end, was not far from the God that such an artist as Joseph

Conrad  imagines--a  supreme  craftsman,  ever  experimenting,  ever  coming

closer to an ideal balancing of lines and forces, and yet always failing to work

out the final harmony.

  The  late  war,  awakening  all  the  primitive  racial  fury  of  the  Western

nations, and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos and

sanctions,  naturally  focused  attention  upon  Nietzsche,  as  upon  the  most

daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians. The Germans, with

their characteristic tendency to explain their every act in terms as realistic and

unpleasant  as  possible,  appear  to  have  mauled  him  in  a  belated  and

unexpected embrace, to the horror, I daresay, of the Kaiser, and perhaps to

the  even  greater  horror  of  Nietzsche's  own  ghost.  The  folks  of  Anglo-

Saxondom,  with  their  equally  characteristic  tendency  to  explain  all  their

enterprises romantically, simultaneously set him up as the Antichrist he no

doubt secretly longed to be. The result was a great deal of misrepresentation

and misunderstanding of him. From the pulpits of the allied countries, and

particularly from those of England and the United States, a horde of patriotic

ecclesiastics  denounced  him  in  extravagant  terms  as  the  author  of  all  the

horrors of the time, and in the newspapers, until the Kaiser was elected sole

bugaboo, he shared the honors of that office with von Hindenburg, the CrownPrince,  Capt.  Boy-Ed,  von  Bernstorff  and  von  Tirpitz.  Most  of  this

denunciation, of course, was frankly idiotic--the na�ve pishposh of suburban

Methodists,  notoriety-seeking  college  professors,  almost  illiterate  editorial

writers, and other such numskulls. In much of it, including not a few official

hymns of hate, Nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the teacher of such

spokesmen of the extremest sort of German nationalism as von Bernhardi and

von  Treitschke--which  was  just  as  intelligent  as  making  George  Bernard

Shaw the mentor of Lloyd-George. In other solemn pronunciamentoes he was

credited with being philosophically responsible for various imaginary crimes

of the enemy--the wholesale slaughter or mutilation of prisoners of war, the

deliberate burning down of Red Cross hospitals, the utilization of the corpses

of  the  slain  for  soap-making.  I  amused  myself,  in  those  gaudy  days,  by

collecting  newspaper  clippings  to  this  general  effect,  and  later  on  I  shall

probably  publish  a  digest  of  them,  as  a  contribution  to  the  study  of  war

hysteria. The thing went to unbelievable lengths. On the strength of the fact

that I had published a book on Nietzsche in 1906, six years after his death, I

was called upon by agents of the Department of Justice, elaborately outfitted

with badges, to meet the charge that I was an intimate associate and agent of

"the  German  monster,  Nietzsky."  I  quote  the  official  proc�s  verbal,  an

indignant but often misspelled document. Alas, poor Nietzsche! After all his

laborious efforts to prove that he was not a German, but a Pole--even after his

heroic readiness, via anti-anti-Semitism, to meet the deduction that, if a Pole,

then probably also a Jew!

  But  under  all  this  alarmed  and  preposterous  tosh  there  was  at  least  a

sound instinct, and that was the instinct which recognized Nietzsche as the

most eloquent, pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the philosophy

to which the Allies against Germany stood committed, and on the strength of

which, at all events in theory, the United States had engaged itself in the war.

He was not, in point of fact, involved with the visible enemy, save in remote

and  transient  ways;  the  German,  officially,  remained  the  most  ardent  of

Christians during the war and became a democrat at its close. But he was

plainly  a  foe  of  democracy  in  all  its  forms,  political,  religious  and

epistemological, and what is worse, his opposition was set forth in terms that

were  not  only  extraordinarily  penetrating  and  devastating,  but  also

uncommonly offensive. It was thus quite natural that he should have aroused

a degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries

that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly, andthat felt it most shaky, one may add, under their feet. I daresay that Nietzsche,

had he been alive, would have got a lot of satisfaction out of the execration

thus heaped upon him, not only because, being a vain fellow, he enjoyed

execration as a tribute to his general singularity, and hence to his superiority,

but  also  and  more  importantly  because,  being  no  mean  psychologist,  he

would have recognized the disconcerting doubts underlying it. If Nietzsche's

criticism  of  democracy  were  as  ignorant  and  empty,  say,  as  the  average

evangelical clergyman's criticism of Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection,

then the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the

Darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks. And if his attack upon

Christianity were mere sound and fury, signifying nothing, then there would

be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk. But these onslaughts, in point

of fact, have behind them a tremendous learning and a great deal of point and

plausibility--there are, in brief, bullets in the gun, teeth in the tiger,--and so it

is no wonder that they excite the ire of men who hold, as a primary article of

belief, that their acceptance would destroy civilization, darken the sun, and

bring Jahveh to sobs upon His Throne.

  But in all this justifiable fear, of course, there remains a false assumption,

and that is the assumption that Nietzsche proposed to destroy Christianity

altogether,  and  so  rob  the  plain  people  of  the  world  of  their  virtue,  their

spiritual  consolations,  and  their  hope  of  heaven.  Nothing  could  be  more

untrue. The fact is that Nietzsche had no interest whatever in the delusions of

the plain people--that is, intrinsically. It seemed to him of small moment what

they believed, so long as it was safely imbecile. What he stood against was

not their beliefs, but the elevation of those beliefs, by any sort of democratic

process, to the dignity of a state philosophy--what he feared most was the

pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual disease from

below.  His  plain  aim  in  "The  Antichrist"  was  to  combat  that  menace  by

completing  the  work  begun,  on  the  one  hand,  by  Darwin  and  the  other

evolutionist philosophers, and, on the other hand, by German historians and

philologians. The net effect of this earlier attack, in the eighties, had been the

collapse of Christian theology as a serious concern of educated men. The

mob, it must be obvious, was very little shaken; even to this day it has not put

off its belief in the essential Christian doctrines. But the intelligentsia, by

1885, had been pretty well convinced. No man of sound information, at the

time Nietzsche planned "The Antichrist," actually believed that the world was

created in seven days, or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as apenalty for the sins of man, or that Noah saved the boa constrictor, the prairie

dog and the pediculus capitis by taking a pair of each into the ark, or that

Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt, or that a fragment of the True Cross

could cure hydrophobia. Such notions, still almost universally prevalent in

Christendom  a  century  before,  were  now  confined  to  the  great  body  of

ignorant and credulous men--that is, to ninety-five or ninety-six percent. of

the race. For a man of the superior minority to subscribe to one of them

publicly was already sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of

psychiatrical attention. Belief in them had become a mark of inferiority, like

the allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.

  But though the theology of Christianity had thus sunk to the lowly estate

of a mere delusion of the rabble, propagated on that level by the ancient caste

of  sacerdotal  parasites,  the  ethics  of  Christianity  continued  to  enjoy  the

utmost acceptance, and perhaps even more acceptance than ever before. It

seemed to be generally felt, in fact, that they simply must be saved from the

wreck--that the world would vanish into chaos if they went the way of the

revelations supporting them. In this fear a great many judicious men joined,

and so there arose what was, in essence, an absolutely new Christian cult--a

cult, to wit, purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older

cult by generations of theologians, and harking back to what was conceived

to  be  the  pure  ethical  doctrine  of  Jesus.  This  cult  still  flourishes;

Protestantism tends to become identical with it; it invades Catholicism as

Modernism; it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence is

manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question. Even Nietzsche himself

yielded  to  it  in  weak  moments,  as  you  will  discover  on  examining  his

somewhat laborious effort to make Paul the villain of Christian theology, and

Jesus no more than an innocent bystander. But this sentimental yielding never

went far enough to distract his attention for long from his main idea, which

was this: that Christian ethics were quite as dubious, at bottom, as Christian

theology--that they were founded, just as surely as such childish fables as the

story of Jonah and the whale, upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities, the

special desires and appetites, of inferior men--that they warred upon the best

interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most extravagant

of objective superstitions. In brief, what he saw in Christian ethics, under all

the poetry and all the fine show of altruism and all the theoretical benefits

therein,  was  a  democratic  effort  to  curb  the  egoism  of  the  strong--a

conspiracy of the chandala against the free functioning of their superiors, nay,against the free progress of mankind. This theory is the thing he exposes in

"The  Antichrist,"  bringing  to  the  business  his  amazingly  chromatic  and

exigent eloquence at its finest flower. This is the "conspiracy" he sets forth in

all the panoply of his characteristic italics, dashes, sforzando interjections and

exclamation points.

  Well, an idea is an idea. The present one may be right and it may be

wrong. One thing is quite certain: that no progress will be made against it by

denouncing it as merely immoral. If it is ever laid at all, it must be laid

evidentially, logically. The notion to the contrary is thoroughly democratic;

the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants; it is always in a democratic society

that  heresy  and  felony  tend  to  be  most  constantly  confused.  One  hears

without surprise of a Bismarck philosophizing placidly (at least in his old

age) upon the delusion of Socialism and of a Frederick the Great playing the

hose of his cynicism upon the absolutism that was almost identical with his

own person, but men in the mass never brook the destructive discussion of

their fundamental beliefs, and that impatience is naturally most evident in

those societies in which men in the mass are most influential. Democracy and

free speech are not facets of one gem; democracy and free speech are eternal

enemies. But in any battle between an institution and an idea, the idea, in the

long run, has the better of it. Here I do not venture into the absurdity of

arguing  that,  as  the  world  wags  on,  the  truth  always  survives.  I  believe

nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, it seems to me that an idea that

happens to be true--or, more exactly, as near to truth as any human idea can

be, and yet remain generally intelligible--it seems to me that such an idea

carries  a  special  and  often  fatal  handicap.  The  majority  of  men  prefer

delusion to truth. It soothes. It is easy to grasp. Above all, it fits more snugly

than the truth into a universe of false appearances--of complex and irrational

phenomena, defectively grasped. But though an idea that is true is thus not

likely  to  prevail,  an  idea  that  is  attacked  enjoys  a  great  advantage.  The

evidence  behind  it  is  now  supported  by  sympathy,  the  sporting  instinct,

sentimentality--and sentimentality is as powerful as an army with banners.

One never hears of a martyr in history whose notions are seriously disputed

today.  The  forgotten  ideas  are  those  of  the  men  who  put  them  forward

soberly and quietly, hoping fatuously that they would conquer by the force of

their  truth;  these  are  the  ideas  that  we  now  struggle  to  rediscover.  Had

Nietzsche lived to be burned at the stake by outraged Mississippi Methodists,

it would have been a glorious day for his doctrines. As it is, they are helpedon their way every time they are denounced as immoral and against God. The

war brought down upon them the maledictions of vast herds of right-thinking

men.  And  now  "The  Antichrist,"  after  fifteen  years  of  neglect,  is  being

reprinted....

  One imagines the author, a sardonic wraith, snickering somewhat sadly

over the fact. His shade, wherever it suffers, is favoured in these days by

many such consolations, some of them of much greater horsepower. Think of

the facts and arguments, even the underlying theories and attitudes, that have

been  borrowed  from  him,  consciously  and  unconsciously,  by  the  foes  of

Bolshevism  during  these  last  thrilling  years!  The  face  of  democracy,

suddenly  seen  hideously  close,  has  scared  the  guardians  of  the  reigning

plutocracy half to death, and they have gone to the devil himself for aid.

Southern  Senators,  almost  illiterate  men,  have  mixed  his  acids  with  well

water and spouted them like affrighted geysers, not knowing what they did.

Nor are they the first to borrow from him. Years ago I called attention to the

debt  incurred  with  characteristic  forgetfulness  of  obligation  by  the  late

Theodore Roosevelt, in "The Strenuous Life" and elsewhere. Roosevelt, a

typical apologist for the existing order, adeptly dragging a herring across the

trail whenever it was menaced, yet managed to delude the native boobery, at

least until toward the end, into accepting him as a fiery exponent of pure

democracy. Perhaps he even fooled himself; charlatans usually do so soon or

late. A study of Nietzsche reveals the sources of much that was honest in

him,  and  exposes  the  hollowness  of  much  that  was  sham.  Nietzsche,  an

infinitely harder and more courageous intellect, was incapable of any such

confusion of ideas; he seldom allowed sentimentality to turn him from the

glaring fact. What is called Bolshevism today he saw clearly a generation ago

and described for what it was and is--democracy in another aspect, the old

ressentiment  of  the  lower  orders  in  free  function  once  more.  Socialism,

Puritanism, Philistinism, Christianity--he saw them all as allotropic forms of

democracy,  as  variations  upon  the  endless  struggle  of  quantity  against

quality, of the weak and timorous against the strong and enterprising, of the

botched against the fit. The world needed a staggering exaggeration to make

it see even half of the truth. It trembles today as it trembled during the French

Revolution. Perhaps it would tremble less if it could combat the monster with

a  clearer  conscience  and  less  burden  of  compromising  theory--if  it  could

launch its forces frankly at the fundamental doctrine, and not merely employ

them to police the transient orgy.    Nietzsche, in the long run, may help it toward that greater honesty. His

notions, propagated by cuttings from cuttings from cuttings, may conceivably

prepare the way for a sounder, more healthful theory of society and of the

state, and so free human progress from the stupidities which now hamper it,

and men of true vision from the despairs which now sicken them. I say it is

conceivable, but I doubt that it is probable. The soul and the belly of mankind

are too evenly balanced; it is not likely that the belly will ever put away its

hunger or forget its power. Here, perhaps, there is an example of the eternal

recurrence that Nietzsche was fond of mulling over in his blacker moods. We

are in the midst of one of the perennial risings of the lower orders. It got

under way long before any of the current Bolshevist demons was born; it was

given its long, secure start by the intolerable tyranny of the plutocracy--the

end product of the Eighteenth Century revolt against the old aristocracy. It

found resistance suddenly slackened by civil war within the plutocracy itself-

-one gang of traders falling upon another gang, to the tune of vast hymn-

singing  and  yells  to  God.  Perhaps  it  has  already  passed  its  apogee;  the

plutocracy, chastened, shows signs of a new solidarity; the wheel continues to

swing 'round. But this combat between proletariat and plutocracy is, after all,

itself a civil war. Two inferiorities struggle for the privilege of polluting the

world. What actual difference does it make to a civilized man, when there is a

steel strike, whether the workmen win or the mill-owners win? The conflict

can interest him only as spectacle, as the conflict between Bonaparte and the

old order in Europe interested Goethe and Beethoven. The victory, whichever

way it goes, will simply bring chaos nearer, and so set the stage for a genuine

revolution later on, with (let us hope) a new feudalism or something better

coming out of it, and a new Thirteenth Century at dawn. This seems to be the

slow, costly way of the worst of habitable worlds.

  In the present case my money is laid upon the plutocracy. It will win

because it will be able, in the long run, to enlist the finer intelligences. The

mob  and  its  maudlin  causes  attract  only  sentimentalists  and  scoundrels,

chiefly  the  latter.  Politics,  under  a  democracy,  reduces  itself  to  a  mere

struggle for office by flatterers of the proletariat; even when a superior man

prevails at that disgusting game he must prevail at the cost of his self-respect.

Not many superior men make the attempt. The average great captain of the

rabble,  when  he  is  not  simply  a  weeper  over  irremediable  wrongs,  is  a

hypocrite so far gone that he is unconscious of his own hypocrisy--a slimy

fellow, offensive to the nose. The plutocracy can recruit measurably morerespectable  janissaries,  if  only  because  it  can  make  self-interest  less

obviously costly to amour propre. Its defect and its weakness lie in the fact

that it is still too young to have acquired dignity. But lately sprung from the

mob it now preys upon, it yet shows some of the habits of mind of that mob:

it is blatant, stupid, ignorant, lacking in all delicate instinct and governmental

finesse. Above all, it remains somewhat heavily moral. One seldom finds it

undertaking one of its characteristic imbecilities without offering a sonorous

moral reason; it spends almost as much to support the Y. M. C. A., vice-

crusading,  Prohibition  and  other  such  puerilities  as  it  spends  upon

Congressmen,  strike-breakers,  gun-men,  kept  patriots  and  newspapers.  In

England the case is even worse. It is almost impossible to find a wealthy

industrial over there who is not also an eminent non-conformist layman, and

even among financiers there are praying brothers. On the Continent, the day

is  saved  by  the  fact  that  the  plutocracy  tends  to  become  more  and  more

Jewish. Here the intellectual cynicism of the Jew almost counterbalances his

social unpleasantness. If he is destined to lead the plutocracy of the world out

of Little Bethel he will fail, of course, to turn it into an aristocracy--i. e., a

caste of gentlemen--, but he will at least make it clever, and hence worthy of

consideration. The case against the Jews is long and damning; it would justify

ten  thousand  times  as  many  pogroms  as  now  go  on  in  the  world.  But

whenever  you  find  a  Davidsb�ndlerschaft  making  practise  against  the

Philistines, there you will find a Jew laying on. Maybe it was this fact that

caused Nietzsche to speak up for the children of Israel quite as often as he

spoke against them. He was not blind to their faults, but when he set them

beside  Christians  he  could  not  deny  their  general  superiority.  Perhaps  in

America and England, as on the Continent, the increasing Jewishness of the

plutocracy, while cutting it off from all chance of ever developing into an

aristocracy, will yet lift it to such a dignity that it will at least deserve a

certain grudging respect.

  But even so, it will remain in a sort of half-world, midway between the

gutter and the stars. Above it will still stand the small group of men that

constitutes the permanent aristocracy of the race--the men of imagination and

high purpose, the makers of genuine progress, the brave and ardent spirits,

above all petty fears and discontents and above all petty hopes and ideals no

less. There were heroes before Agamemnon; there will be Bachs after Johann

Sebastian. And beneath the Judaized plutocracy, the sublimated bourgeoisie,

there the immemorial proletariat, I venture to guess, will roar on, endlesslytortured by its vain hatreds and envies, stampeded and made to tremble by its

ancient  superstitions,  prodded  and  made  miserable  by  its  sordid  and

degrading  hopes.  It  seems  to  me  very  likely  that,  in  this  proletariat,

Christianity will continue to survive. It is nonsense, true enough, but it is

sweet. Nietzsche, denouncing its dangers as a poison, almost falls into the

error of denying it its undoubtedly sugary smack. Of all the religions ever

devised by the great practical jokers of the race, this is the one that offers

most for the least money, so to speak, to the inferior man. It starts out by

denying his inferiority in plain terms: all men are equal in the sight of God. It

ends by erecting that inferiority into a sort of actual superiority: it is a merit

to be stupid, and miserable, and sorely put upon--of such are the celestial

elect.  Not  all  the  eloquence  of  a  million  Nietzsches,  nor  all  the  painful

marshalling of evidence of a million Darwins and Harnacks, will ever empty

that great consolation of its allure. The most they can ever accomplish is to

make the superior orders of men acutely conscious of the exact nature of it,

and so give them armament against the contagion. This is going on; this is

being done. I think that "The Antichrist" has a useful place in that enterprise.

It is strident, it is often extravagant, it is, to many sensitive men, in the worst

of possible taste, but at bottom it is enormously apt and effective--and on the

surface it is undoubtedly a good show. One somehow enjoys, with the malice

that is native to man, the spectacle of anathemas batted back; it is refreshing

to  see  the  pitchfork  employed  against  gentlemen  who  have  doomed  such

innumerable caravans to hell. In Nietzsche they found, after many long years,

a foeman worthy of them--not a mere fancy swordsman like Voltaire, or a

mob orator like Tom Paine, or a pedant like the heretics of exegesis, but a

gladiator  armed  with  steel  and  armoured  with  steel,  and  showing  all  the

ferocious gusto of a mediaeval bishop. It is a pity that Holy Church has no

process for the elevation of demons, like its process for the canonization of

saints. There must be a long roll of black miracles to the discredit of the

Accursed Friedrich--sinners purged of conscience and made happy in their

sinning, clerics shaken in their theology by visions of a new and better holy

city, the strong made to exult, the weak robbed of their old sad romance. It

would be a pleasure to see the Advocatus Diaboli turn from the table of the

prosecution to the table of the defence, and move in solemn form for the

damnation of the Naumburg hobgoblin....

  Of  all  Nietzsche's  books,  "The  Antichrist"  comes  nearest  to

conventionality  in  form.  It  presents  a  connected  argument  with  very  fewinterludes, and has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most of his works are

in the form of collections of apothegms, and sometimes the subject changes

on every second page. This fact constitutes one of the counts in the orthodox

indictment  of  him:  it  is  cited  as  proof  that  his  capacity  for  consecutive

thought was limited, and that he was thus deficient mentally, and perhaps a

downright  moron.  The  argument,  it  must  be  obvious,  is  fundamentally

nonsensical.  What  deceives  the  professors  is  the  traditional  prolixity  of

philosophers. Because the average philosophical writer, when he essays to

expose his ideas, makes such inordinate drafts upon the parts of speech that

the  dictionary  is  almost  emptied  these  defective  observers  jump  to  the

conclusion that his intrinsic notions are of corresponding weight. This is not

unseldom  quite  untrue.  What  makes  philosophy  so  garrulous  is  not  the

profundity of philosophers, but their lack of art; they are like physicians who

sought to cure a slight hyperacidity by giving the patient a carload of burned

oyster-shells to eat. There is, too, the endless poll-parrotting that goes on:

each new philosopher must prove his learning by laboriously rehearsing the

ideas  of  all  previous  philosophers....  Nietzsche  avoided  both  faults.  He

always  assumed  that  his  readers  knew  the  books,  and  that  it  was  thus

unnecessary to rewrite them. And, having an idea that seemed to him to be

novel and original, he stated it in as few words as possible, and then shut

down.  Sometimes  he  got  it  into  a  hundred  words;  sometimes  it  took  a

thousand; now and then, as in the present case, he developed a series of

related ideas into a connected book. But he never wrote a word too many. He

never pumped up an idea to make it appear bigger than it actually was. The

pedagogues, alas, are not accustomed to that sort of writing in serious fields.

They resent it, and sometimes they even try to improve it. There exists, in

fact, a huge and solemn tome on Nietzsche by a learned man of America in

which all of his brilliancy is painfully translated into the windy phrases of the

seminaries. The tome is satisfactorily ponderous, but the meat of the cocoanut

is  left  out:  there  is  actually  no  discussion  of  the  Nietzschean  view  of

Christianity!... Always Nietzsche daunts the pedants. He employed too few

words for them--and he had too many ideas.

  The  present  translation  of  "The  Antichrist"  is  published  by  agreement

with Dr. Oscar Levy, editor of the English edition of Nietzsche. There are

two earlier translations, one by Thomas Common and the other by Anthony

M. Ludovici. That of Mr. Common follows the text very closely, and thusoccasionally  shows  some  essentially  German  turns  of  phrase;  that  of  Mr.

Ludovici is more fluent but rather less exact. I do not offer my own version

on  the  plea  that  either  of  these  is  useless;  on  the  contrary,  I  cheerfully

acknowledge that they have much merit, and that they helped me at almost

every  line.  I  began  this  new  Englishing  of  the  book,  not  in  any  hope  of

supplanting them, and surely not with any notion of meeting a great public

need, but simply as a private amusement in troubled days. But as I got on

with it I began to see ways of putting some flavour of Nietzsche's peculiar

style into the English, and so amusement turned into a more or less serious

labour. The result, of course, is far from satisfactory, but it at least represents

a  very  diligent  attempt.  Nietzsche,  always  under  the  influence  of  French

models, wrote a German that differs materially from any other German that I

know. It is more nervous, more varied, more rapid in tempo; it runs to more

effective climaxes; it is never stodgy. His marks begin to show upon the

writing of the younger Germans of today. They are getting away from the old

thunderous  manner,  with  its  long  sentences  and  its  tedious  grammatical

complexities. In the course of time, I daresay, they will develop a German

almost as clear as French and almost as colourful and resilient as English.

  I owe thanks to Dr. Levy for his imprimatur, to Mr. Theodor Hemberger

for criticism, and to Messrs. Common and Ludovici for showing me the way

around many a difficulty.

                                        PREFACE

  This book belongs to the most rare of men. Perhaps not one of them is yet

alive.  It  is  possible  that  they  may  be  among  those  who  understand  my

"Zarathustra":  how  could  I  confound  myself  with  those  who  are  now

sprouting ears?--First the day after tomorrow must come for me. Some men

are born posthumously.

  The  conditions  under  which  any  one  understands  me,  and  necessarily

understands me--I know them only too well. Even to endure my seriousness,

my passion, he must carry intellectual integrity to the verge of hardness. He

must be accustomed to living on mountain tops--and to looking upon the

wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as beneath him. He must have

become indifferent; he must never ask of the truth whether it brings profit to

him or a fatality to him.... He must have an inclination, born of strength, for

questions that no one has the courage for; the courage for the forbidden;

predestination for the labyrinth. The experience of seven solitudes. New earsfor new music. New eyes for what is most distant. A new conscience for

truths that have hitherto remained unheard. And the will to economize in the

grand manner--to hold together his strength, his enthusiasm.... Reverence for

self; love of self; absolute freedom of self....

  Very well, then! of that sort only are my readers, my true readers, my

readers  foreordained:  of  what  account  are  the  rest?--The  rest  are  merely

humanity.--One  must  make  one's  self  superior  to  humanity,  in  power,  in

loftiness of soul,--in contempt.

    FRIEDRICH W. NIETZSCHE.

                                  THE ANTICHRIST

  1.

  --Let us look each other in the face. We are Hyperboreans--we know well

enough how remote our place is. "Neither by land nor by water will you find

the road to the Hyperboreans": even Pindar,[1] in his day, knew that much

about  us.  Beyond  the  North,  beyond  the  ice,  beyond  death--our  life,  our

happiness.... We have discovered that happiness; we know the way; we got

our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth. Who else has

found it?--The man of today?--"I don't know either the way out or the way in;

I am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in"--so sighs the

man of today.... This is the sort of modernity that made us ill,--we sickened

on  lazy  peace,  cowardly  compromise,  the  whole  virtuous  dirtiness  of  the

modern Yea and Nay. This tolerance and largeur of the heart that "forgives"

everything because it "understands" everything is a sirocco to us. Rather live

amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds!... We

were brave enough; we spared neither ourselves nor others; but we were a

long time finding out where to direct our courage. We grew dismal; they

called us fatalists. Our fate--it was the fulness, the tension, the storing up of

powers. We thirsted for the lightnings and great deeds; we kept as far as

possible from the happiness of the weakling, from "resignation"... There was

thunder in our air; nature, as we embodied it, became overcast--for we had

not yet found the way. The formula of our happiness: a Yea, a Nay, a straight

line, a goal....

  [1] Cf. the tenth Pythian ode. See also the fourth book of Herodotus. The

Hyperboreans were a mythical people beyond the Rhipaean mountains, in the

far North. They enjoyed unbroken happiness and perpetual youth.

  2.

  What  is  good?--Whatever  augments  the  feeling  of  power,  the  will  topower, power itself, in man.

  What is evil?--Whatever springs from weakness.

  What is happiness?--The feeling that power increases--that resistance is

overcome.

  Not contentment, but more power; not peace at any price, but war; not

virtue, but efficiency (virtue in the Renaissance sense, virtu, virtue free of

moral acid).

  The weak and the botched shall perish: first principle of our charity. And

one should help them to it.

  What is more harmful than any vice?--Practical sympathy for the botched

and the weak--Christianity....

  3.

  The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the order

of living creatures (--man is an end--): but what type of man must be bred,

must be willed, as being the most valuable, the most worthy of life, the most

secure guarantee of the future.

  This  more  valuable  type  has  appeared  often  enough  in  the  past:  but

always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately willed.

Very often it has been precisely the most feared; hitherto it has been almost

the terror of terrors;--and out of that terror the contrary type has been willed,

cultivated and attained: the domestic animal, the herd animal, the sick brute-

man--the Christian....

  4.

    Mankind  surely  does  not  represent  an  evolution  toward  a  better  or

stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This "progress" is

merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of today, in

his  essential  worth,  falls  far  below  the  European  of  the  Renaissance;  the

process  of  evolution  does  not  necessarily  mean  elevation,  enhancement,

strengthening.

  True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various parts

of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in these cases a

higher  type  certainly  manifests  itself;  something  which,  compared  to

mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman. Such happy strokes of

high success have always been possible, and will remain possible, perhaps,

for all time to come. Even whole races, tribes and nations may occasionally

represent such lucky accidents.

  5.  We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to

the death against this higher type of man, it has put all the deepest instincts of

this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of evil, of the Evil One

himself, out of these instincts--the strong man as the typical reprobate, the

"outcast among men." Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low,

the  botched;  it  has  made  an  ideal  out  of  antagonism  to  all  the  self-

preservative  instincts  of  sound  life;  it  has  corrupted  even  the  faculties  of

those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest

intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. The most

lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his intellect

had  been  destroyed  by  original  sin,  whereas  it  was  actually  destroyed  by

Christianity!--

  6.

  It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn back

the curtain from the rottenness of man. This word, in my mouth, is at least

free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation against humanity.

It  is  used--and  I  wish  to  emphasize  the  fact  again--without  any  moral

significance: and this is so far true that the rottenness I speak of is most

apparent  to  me  precisely  in  those  quarters  where  there  has  been  most

aspiration,  hitherto,  toward  "virtue"  and  "godliness."  As  you  probably

surmise, I understand rottenness in the sense of decadence: my argument is

that all the values on which mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are

decadence-values.

  I  call  an  animal,  a  species,  an  individual  corrupt,  when  it  loses  its

instincts, when it chooses, when it prefers, what is injurious to it. A history of

the "higher feelings," the "ideals of humanity"--and it is possible that I'll have

to  write  it--would  almost  explain  why  man  is  so  degenerate.  Life  itself

appears to me as an instinct for growth, for survival, for the accumulation of

forces,  for  power:  whenever  the  will  to  power  fails  there  is  disaster.  My

contention is that all the highest values of humanity have been emptied of this

will--that the values of decadence, of nihilism, now prevail under the holiest

names.

  7.

    Christianity is called the religion of pity.--Pity stands in opposition to all

the tonic passions that augment the energy of the feeling of aliveness: it is a

depressant. A man loses power when he pities. Through pity that drain upon

strength  which  suffering  works  is  multiplied  a  thousandfold.  Suffering  ismade contagious by pity; under certain circumstances it may lead to a total

sacrifice  of  life  and  living  energy--a  loss  out  of  all  proportion  to  the

magnitude of the cause (--the case of the death of the Nazarene). This is the

first view of it; there is, however, a still more important one. If one measures

the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up, its character as a

menace to life appears in a much clearer light. Pity thwarts the whole law of

evolution, which is the law of natural selection. It preserves whatever is ripe

for destruction; it fights on the side of those disinherited and condemned by

life; by maintaining life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life

itself a gloomy and dubious aspect. Mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue

(--in  every  superior  moral  system  it  appears  as  a  weakness--);  going  still

further, it has been called the virtue, the source and foundation of all other

virtues--but let us always bear in mind that this was from the standpoint of a

philosophy that was nihilistic, and upon whose shield the denial of life was

inscribed. Schopenhauer was right in this: that by means of pity life is denied,

and made worthy of denial--pity is the technic of nihilism. Let me repeat: this

depressing and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which

work for the preservation and enhancement of life: in the r�le of protector of

the  miserable,  it  is  a  prime  agent  in  the  promotion  of  decadence--pity

persuades to extinction.... Of course, one doesn't say "extinction": one says

"the  other  world,"  or  "God,"  or  "the  true  life,"  or  Nirvana,  salvation,

blessedness....  This  innocent  rhetoric,  from  the  realm  of  religious-ethical

balderdash, appears a good deal less innocent when one reflects upon the

tendency that it conceals beneath sublime words: the tendency to destroy life.

Schopenhauer  was  hostile  to  life:  that  is  why  pity  appeared  to  him  as  a

virtue.... Aristotle, as every one knows, saw in pity a sickly and dangerous

state of mind, the remedy for which was an occasional purgative: he regarded

tragedy as that purgative. The instinct of life should prompt us to seek some

means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous accumulation of

pity as that appearing in Schopenhauer's case (and also, alack, in that of our

whole  literary  decadence,  from  St.  Petersburg  to  Paris,  from  Tolstoi  to

Wagner), that it may burst and be discharged.... Nothing is more unhealthy,

amid all our unhealthy modernism, than Christian pity. To be the doctors

here, to be unmerciful here, to wield the knife here--all this is our business,

all  this  is  our  sort  of  humanity,  by  this  sign  we  are  philosophers,  we

Hyperboreans!--

  8.  It is necessary to say just whom we regard as our antagonists: theologians

and  all  who  have  any  theological  blood  in  their  veins--this  is  our  whole

philosophy.... One must have faced that menace at close hand, better still, one

must have had experience of it directly and almost succumbed to it, to realize

that it is not to be taken lightly (--the alleged free-thinking of our naturalists

and physiologists seems to me to be a joke--they have no passion about such

things; they have not suffered--). This poisoning goes a great deal further

than most people think: I find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all

who regard themselves as "idealists"--among all who, by virtue of a higher

point of departure, claim a right to rise above reality, and to look upon it with

suspicion....  The  idealist,  like  the  ecclesiastic,  carries  all  sorts  of  lofty

concepts in his hand (--and not only in his hand!); he launches them with

benevolent contempt against "understanding," "the senses," "honor," "good

living,"  "science";  he  sees  such  things  as  beneath  him,  as  pernicious  and

seductive forces, on which "the soul" soars as a pure thing-in-itself--as if

humility, chastity, poverty, in a word, holiness, had not already done much

more damage to life than all imaginable horrors and vices.... The pure soul is

a pure lie.... So long as the priest, that professional denier, calumniator and

poisoner  of  life,  is  accepted  as  a  higher  variety  of  man,  there  can  be  no

answer to the question, What is truth? Truth has already been stood on its

head  when  the  obvious  attorney  of  mere  emptiness  is  mistaken  for  its

representative....

  9.

  Upon  this  theological  instinct  I  make  war:  I  find  the  tracks  of  it

everywhere.  Whoever  has  theological  blood  in  his  veins  is  shifty  and

dishonourable in all things. The pathetic thing that grows out of this condition

is called faith: in other words, closing one's eyes upon one's self once for all,

to avoid suffering the sight of incurable falsehood. People erect a concept of

morality, of virtue, of holiness upon this false view of all things; they ground

good conscience upon faulty vision; they argue that no other sort of vision

has value any more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of

"God," "salvation" and "eternity." I unearth this theological instinct in all

directions:  it  is  the  most  widespread  and  the  most  subterranean  form  of

falsehood to be found on earth. Whatever a theologian regards as true must

be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth. His profound instinct of

self-preservation stands against truth ever coming into honour in any way, or

even getting stated. Wherever the influence of theologians is felt there is atransvaluation of values, and the concepts "true" and "false" are forced to

change places: whatever is most damaging to life is there called "true," and

whatever  exalts  it,  intensifies  it,  approves  it,  justifies  it  and  makes  it

triumphant is there called "false."... When theologians, working through the

"consciences" of princes (or of peoples--), stretch out their hands for power,

there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will to make an end,

the nihilistic will exerts that power....

  10.

  Among  Germans  I  am  immediately  understood  when  I  say  that

theological  blood  is  the  ruin  of  philosophy.  The  Protestant  pastor  is  the

grandfather  of  German  philosophy;  Protestantism  itself  is  its  peccatum

originale. Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of Christianity--

and of reason.... One need only utter the words "T�bingen School" to get an

understanding of what German philosophy is at bottom--a very artful form of

theology.... The Suabians are the best liars in Germany; they lie innocently....

Why all the rejoicing over the appearance of Kant that went through the

learned world of Germany, three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of

preachers and teachers--why the German conviction still echoing, that with

Kant  came  a  change  for  the  better?  The  theological  instinct  of  German

scholars made them see clearly just what had become possible again.... A

backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the "true world,"

the concept of morality as the essence of the world (--the two most vicious

errors  that  ever  existed!),  were  once  more,  thanks  to  a  subtle  and  wily

scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then at least no longer refutable....

Reason, the prerogative of reason, does not go so far.... Out of reality there

had been made "appearance"; an absolutely false world, that of being, had

been  turned  into  reality....  The  success  of  Kant  is  merely  a  theological

success;  he  was,  like  Luther  and  Leibnitz,  but  one  more  impediment  to

German integrity, already far from steady.--

  11.

  A word now against Kant as a moralist. A virtue must be our invention; it

must spring out of our personal need and defence. In every other case it is a

source of danger. That which does not belong to our life menaces it; a virtue

which has its roots in mere respect for the concept of "virtue," as Kant would

have it, is pernicious. "Virtue," "duty," "good for its own sake," goodness

grounded upon impersonality or a notion of universal validity--these are all

chimeras, and in them one finds only an expression of the decay, the lastcollapse  of  life,  the  Chinese  spirit  of  K�nigsberg.  Quite  the  contrary  is

demanded by the most profound laws of self-preservation and of growth: to

wit, that every man find his own virtue, his own categorical imperative. A

nation goes to pieces when it confounds its duty with the general concept of

duty. Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every

"impersonal"  duty,  every  sacrifice  before  the  Moloch  of  abstraction.--To

think that no one has thought of Kant's categorical imperative as dangerous to

life!...  The  theological  instinct  alone  took  it  under  protection!--An  action

prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a right action by the amount of

pleasure that goes with it: and yet that Nihilist, with his bowels of Christian

dogmatism, regarded pleasure as an objection.... What destroys a man more

quickly than to work, think and feel without inner necessity, without any

deep personal desire, without pleasure--as a mere automaton of duty? That is

the recipe for decadence, and no less for idiocy.... Kant became an idiot.--

And such a man was the contemporary of Goethe! This calamitous spinner of

cobwebs passed for the German philosopher--still passes today!... I forbid

myself to say what I think of the Germans.... Didn't Kant see in the French

Revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic form to the

organic?  Didn't  he  ask  himself  if  there  was  a  single  event  that  could  be

explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in man, so that on the

basis of it, "the tendency of mankind toward the good" could be explained,

once and for all time? Kant's answer: "That is revolution." Instinct at fault in

everything  and  anything,  instinct  as  a  revolt  against  nature,  German

decadence as a philosophy--that is Kant!--

  12.

  I  put  aside  a  few  sceptics,  the  types  of  decency  in  the  history  of

philosophy: the rest haven't the slightest conception of intellectual integrity.

They  behave  like  women,  all  these  great  enthusiasts  and  prodigies--they

regard "beautiful feelings" as arguments, the "heaving breast" as the bellows

of divine inspiration, conviction as the criterion of truth. In the end, with

"German" innocence, Kant tried to give a scientific flavour to this form of

corruption,  this  dearth  of  intellectual  conscience,  by  calling  it  "practical

reason." He deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions

when  it  was  desirable  not  to  trouble  with  reason--that  is,  when  morality,

when the sublime command "thou shalt," was heard. When one recalls the

fact that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development

from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this fraud uponself, ceases to be remarkable. When a man feels that he has a divine mission,

say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind--when a man feels the divine

spark  in  his  heart  and  believes  that  he  is  the  mouthpiece  of  supernatural

imperatives--when such a mission inflames him, it is only natural that he

should stand beyond all merely reasonable standards of judgment. He feels

that he is himself sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a

higher order!... What has a priest to do with philosophy! He stands far above

it!--And hitherto the priest has ruled!--He has determined the meaning of

"true" and "not true"!...

  13.

  Let us not underestimate this fact: that we ourselves, we free spirits, are

already a "transvaluation of all values," a visualized declaration of war and

victory  against  all  the  old  concepts  of  "true"  and  "not  true."  The  most

valuable intuitions are the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are

those which determine methods. All the methods, all the principles of the

scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of the most

profound  contempt;  if  a  man  inclined  to  them  he  was  excluded  from  the

society of "decent" people--he passed as "an enemy of God," as a scoffer at

the  truth,  as  one  "possessed."  As  a  man  of  science,  he  belonged  to  the

Chandala[2].... We have had the whole pathetic stupidity of mankind against

us--their every notion of what the truth ought to be, of what the service of the

truth ought to be--their every "thou shalt" was launched against us.... Our

objectives, our methods, our quiet, cautious, distrustful manner--all appeared

to  them  as  absolutely  discreditable  and  contemptible.--Looking  back,  one

may almost ask one's self with reason if it was not actually an aesthetic sense

that kept men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque

effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses. It was our

modesty that stood out longest against their taste.... How well they guessed

that, these turkey-cocks of God!

  [2] The lowest of the Hindu castes.

  14.

  We have unlearned something. We have become more modest in every

way. We no longer derive man from the "spirit," from the "godhead"; we

have dropped him back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest of

the  beasts  because  he  is  the  craftiest;  one  of  the  results  thereof  is  his

intellectuality. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit which

would assert itself even here: that man is the great second thought in theprocess  of  organic  evolution.  He  is,  in  truth,  anything  but  the  crown  of

creation:  beside  him  stand  many  other  animals,  all  at  similar  stages  of

development.... And even when we say that we say a bit too much, for man,

relatively speaking, is the most botched of all the animals and the sickliest,

and he has wandered the most dangerously from his instincts--though for all

that,  to  be  sure,  he  remains  the  most  interesting!--As  regards  the  lower

animals,  it  was  Descartes  who  first  had  the  really  admirable  daring  to

describe them as machina; the whole of our physiology is directed toward

proving the truth of this doctrine. Moreover, it is illogical to set man apart, as

Descartes did: what we know of man today is limited precisely by the extent

to which we have regarded him, too, as a machine. Formerly we accorded to

man, as his inheritance from some higher order of beings, what was called

"free will"; now we have taken even this will from him, for the term no

longer describes anything that we can understand. The old word "will" now

connotes only a sort of result, an individual reaction, that follows inevitably

upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious stimuli--the will no

longer  "acts,"  or  "moves."...  Formerly  it  was  thought  that  man's

consciousness, his "spirit," offered evidence of his high origin, his divinity.

That he might be perfected, he was advised, tortoise-like, to draw his senses

in, to have no traffic with earthly things, to shuffle off his mortal coil--then

only the important part of him, the "pure spirit," would remain. Here again

we have thought out the thing better: to us consciousness, or "the spirit,"

appears  as  a  symptom  of  a  relative  imperfection  of  the  organism,  as  an

experiment, a groping, a misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up

nervous force unnecessarily--we deny that anything can be done perfectly so

long as it is done consciously. The "pure spirit" is a piece of pure stupidity:

take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called "mortal shell,"

and the rest is miscalculation--that is all!...

  15.

  Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of contact

with  actuality.  It  offers  purely  imaginary  causes  ("God,"  "soul,"  "ego,"

"spirit," "free will"--or even "unfree"), and purely imaginary effects ("sin,"

"salvation,"  "grace,"  "punishment,"  "forgiveness  of  sins").  Intercourse

between imaginary beings ("God," "spirits," "souls"); an imaginary natural

history (anthropocentric; a total denial of the concept of natural causes); an

imaginary  psychology  (misunderstandings  of  self,  misinterpretations  of

agreeable or disagreeable general feelings--for example, of the states of thenervus  sympathicus  with  the  help  of  the  sign-language  of  religio-ethical

balderdash--, "repentance," "pangs of conscience," "temptation by the devil,"

"the presence of God"); an imaginary teleology (the "kingdom of God," "the

last  judgment,"  "eternal  life").--This  purely  fictitious  world,  greatly  to  its

disadvantage, is to be differentiated from the world of dreams; the latter at

least reflects reality, whereas the former falsifies it, cheapens it and denies it.

Once the concept of "nature" had been opposed to the concept of "God," the

word "natural" necessarily took on the meaning of "abominable"--the whole

of that fictitious world has its sources in hatred of the natural (--the real!--),

and is no more than evidence of a profound uneasiness in the presence of

reality.... This explains everything. Who alone has any reason for living his

way out of reality? The man who suffers under it. But to suffer from reality

one must be a botched reality.... The preponderance of pains over pleasures is

the cause of this fictitious morality and religion: but such a preponderance

also supplies the formula for decadence....

  16.

  A criticism of the Christian concept of God leads inevitably to the same

conclusion.--A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god. In

him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues--

it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may

offer thanks. He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god

to whom they can make sacrifices.... Religion, within these limits, is a form

of gratitude. A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a

god.--Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he must be

able to play either friend or foe--he is wondered at for the good he does as

well as for the evil he does. But the castration, against all nature, of such a

god,  making  him  a  god  of  goodness  alone,  would  be  contrary  to  human

inclination. Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god;

it  doesn't  have  to  thank  mere  tolerance  and  humanitarianism  for  its  own

existence.... What would be the value of a god who knew nothing of anger,

revenge, envy, scorn, cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced

the rapturous ardeurs of victory and of destruction? No one would understand

such a god: why should any one want him?--True enough, when a nation is

on the downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of

freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first necessity

and the virtues of submission as measures of self-preservation, then it must

overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous and demure; hecounsels "peace of soul," hate-no-more, leniency, "love" of friend and foe. He

moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private virtue; he becomes the god

of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a cosmopolitan.... Formerly he

represented  a  people,  the  strength  of  a  people,  everything  aggressive  and

thirsty for power in the soul of a people; now he is simply the good god....

The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods: either they are the will

to power--in which case they are national gods--or incapacity for power--in

which case they have to be good....

  17.

  Wherever the will to power begins to decline, in whatever form, there is

always an accompanying decline physiologically, a decadence. The divinity

of this decadence, shorn of its masculine virtues and passions, is converted

perforce into a god of the physiologically degraded, of the weak. Of course,

they do not call themselves the weak; they call themselves "the good."... No

hint is needed to indicate the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction

of a good and an evil god first became possible. The same instinct which

prompts  the  inferior  to  reduce  their  own  god  to  "goodness-in-itself"  also

prompts them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors;

they make revenge on their masters by making a devil of the latter's god.--

The good god, and the devil like him--both are abortions of decadence.--How

can we be so tolerant of the na�vete of Christian theologians as to join in

their  doctrine  that  the  evolution  of  the  concept  of  god  from  "the  god  of

Israel," the god of a people, to the Christian god, the essence of all goodness,

is to be described as progress?--But even Renan does this. As if Renan had a

right  to  be  na�ve!  The  contrary  actually  stares  one  in  the  face.  When

everything necessary to ascending life; when all that is strong, courageous,

masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god; when he

has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary, a sheet-anchor for

the drowning; when he becomes the poor man's god, the sinner's god, the

invalid's  god  par  excellence,  and  the  attribute  of  "saviour"  or  "redeemer"

remains as the one essential attribute of divinity--just what is the significance

of such a metamorphosis? what does such a reduction of the godhead imply?-

-To be sure, the "kingdom of God" has thus grown larger. Formerly he had

only  his  own  people,  his  "chosen"  people.  But  since  then  he  has  gone

wandering, like his people themselves, into foreign parts; he has given up

settling  down  quietly  anywhere;  finally  he  has  come  to  feel  at  home

everywhere,  and  is  the  great  cosmopolitan--until  now  he  has  the  "greatmajority" on his side, and half the earth. But this god of the "great majority,"

this  democrat  among  gods,  has  not  become  a  proud  heathen  god:  on  the

contrary, he remains a Jew, he remains a god in a corner, a god of all the dark

nooks and crevices, of all the noisesome quarters of the world!... His earthly

kingdom,  now  as  always,  is  a  kingdom  of  the  underworld,  a  souterrain

kingdom,  a  ghetto  kingdom....  And  he  himself  is  so  pale,  so  weak,  so

decadent.... Even the palest of the pale are able to master him--messieurs the

metaphysicians, those albinos of the intellect. They spun their webs around

him for so long that finally he was hypnotized, and began to spin himself, and

became  another  metaphysician.  Thereafter  he  resumed  once  more  his  old

business of spinning the world out of his inmost being sub specie Spinozae;

thereafter  he  became  ever  thinner  and  paler--became  the  "ideal,"  became

"pure  spirit,"  became  "the  absolute,"  became  "the  thing-in-itself."...  The

collapse of a god: he became a "thing-in-itself."

  18.

  The Christian concept of a god--the god as the patron of the sick, the god

as  a  spinner  of  cobwebs,  the  god  as  a  spirit--is  one  of  the  most  corrupt

concepts that has ever been set up in the world: it probably touches low-water

mark  in  the  ebbing  evolution  of  the  god-type.  God  degenerated  into  the

contradiction of life. Instead of being its transfiguration and eternal Yea! In

him war is declared on life, on nature, on the will to live! God becomes the

formula for every slander upon the "here and now," and for every lie about

the "beyond"! In him nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is

made holy!...

  19.

  The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this

Christian god does little credit to their gift for religion--and not much more to

their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of such a moribund

and worn-out product of the decadence. A curse lies upon them because they

were not equal to it; they made illness, decrepitude and contradiction a part of

their instincts--and since then they have not managed to create any more

gods. Two thousand years have come and gone--and not a single new god!

Instead, there still exists, and as if by some intrinsic right,--as if he were the

ultimatum and maximum of the power to create gods, of the creator spiritus

in  mankind--this  pitiful  god  of  Christian  monotono-theism!  This  hybrid

image  of  decay,  conjured  up  out  of  emptiness,  contradiction  and  vain

imagining, in which all the instincts of decadence, all the cowardices andwearinesses of the soul find their sanction!--

  20.

  In my condemnation of Christianity I surely hope I do no injustice to a

related  religion  with  an  even  larger  number  of  believers:  I  allude  to

Buddhism. Both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religions--they are

both decadence religions--but they are separated from each other in a very

remarkable way. For the fact that he is able to compare them at all the critic

of Christianity is indebted to the scholars of India.--Buddhism is a hundred

times as realistic as Christianity--it is part of its living heritage that it is able

to face problems objectively and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of

philosophical  speculation.  The  concept,  "god,"  was  already  disposed  of

before it appeared. Buddhism is the only genuinely positive religion to be

encountered in history, and this applies even to its epistemology (which is a

strict  phenomenalism).  It  does  not  speak  of  a  "struggle  with  sin,"  but,

yielding to reality, of the "struggle with suffering." Sharply differentiating

itself from Christianity, it puts the self-deception that lies in moral concepts

behind it; it is, in my phrase, beyond good and evil.--The two physiological

facts  upon  which  it  grounds  itself  and  upon  which  it  bestows  its  chief

attention are: first, an excessive sensitiveness to sensation, which manifests

itself  as  a  refined  susceptibility  to  pain,  and  secondly,  an  extraordinary

spirituality, a too protracted concern with concepts and logical procedures,

under  the  influence  of  which  the  instinct  of  personality  has  yielded  to  a

notion of the "impersonal." (--Both of these states will be familiar to a few of

my  readers,  the  objectivists,  by  experience,  as  they  are  to  me).  These

physiological states produced a depression, and Buddha tried to combat it by

hygienic measures. Against it he prescribed a life in the open, a life of travel;

moderation in eating and a careful selection of foods; caution in the use of

intoxicants; the same caution in arousing any of the passions that foster a

bilious  habit  and  heat  the  blood;  finally,  no  worry,  either  on  one's  own

account or on account of others. He encourages ideas that make for either

quiet contentment or good cheer--he finds means to combat ideas of other

sorts.  He  understands  good,  the  state  of  goodness,  as  something  which

promotes health. Prayer is not included, and neither is asceticism. There is no

categorical  imperative  nor  any  disciplines,  even  within  the  walls  of  a

monastery (--it is always possible to leave--). These things would have been

simply means of increasing the excessive sensitiveness above mentioned. For

the  same  reason  he  does  not  advocate  any  conflict  with  unbelievers;  histeaching  is  antagonistic  to  nothing  so  much  as  to  revenge,  aversion,

ressentiment (--"enmity never brings an end to enmity": the moving refrain of

all Buddhism....) And in all this he was right, for it is precisely these passions

which, in view of his main regiminal purpose, are unhealthful. The mental

fatigue that he observes, already plainly displayed in too much "objectivity"

(that is, in the individual's loss of interest in himself, in loss of balance and of

"egoism"), he combats by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual interests

back  to  the  ego.  In  Buddha's  teaching  egoism  is  a  duty.  The  "one  thing

needful," the question "how can you be delivered from suffering," regulates

and determines the whole spiritual diet. (--Perhaps one will here recall that

Athenian who also declared war upon pure "scientificality," to wit, Socrates,

who also elevated egoism to the estate of a morality).

  21.

  The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of

great gentleness and liberality, and no militarism; moreover, it must get its

start among the higher and better educated classes. Cheerfulness, quiet and

the  absence  of  desire  are  the  chief  desiderata,  and  they  are  attained.

Buddhism  is  not  a  religion  in  which  perfection  is  merely  an  object  of

aspiration: perfection is actually normal.--

  Under Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed come

to the fore: it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their salvation in

it.  Here  the  prevailing  pastime,  the  favourite  remedy  for  boredom  is  the

discussion  of  sin,  self-criticism,  the  inquisition  of  conscience;  here  the

emotion produced by power (called "God") is pumped up (by prayer); here

the highest good is regarded as unattainable, as a gift, as "grace." Here, too,

open dealing is lacking; concealment and the darkened room are Christian.

Here body is despised and hygiene is denounced as sensual; the church even

ranges  itself  against  cleanliness  (--the  first  Christian  order  after  the

banishment of the Moors closed the public baths, of which there were 270 in

Cordova  alone).  Christian,  too,  is  a  certain  cruelty  toward  one's  self  and

toward  others;  hatred  of  unbelievers;  the  will  to  persecute.  Sombre  and

disquieting ideas are in the foreground; the most esteemed states of mind,

bearing the most respectable names, are epileptoid; the diet is so regulated as

to  engender  morbid  symptoms  and  over-stimulate  the  nerves.  Christian,

again, is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth, to the "aristocratic"--

along with a sort of secret rivalry with them (--one resigns one's "body" to

them;  one  wants  only  one's  "soul"...).  And  Christian  is  all  hatred  of  theintellect,  of  pride,  of  courage,  of  freedom,  of  intellectual  libertinage;

Christian is all hatred of the senses, of joy in the senses, of joy in general....

  22.

  When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest orders,

the  underworld  of  the  ancient  world,  and  began  seeking  power  among

barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with exhausted men, but with men

still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture--in brief, strong men, but

bungled  men.  Here,  unlike  in  the  case  of  the  Buddhists,  the  cause  of

discontent  with  self,  suffering  through  self,  is  not  merely  a  general

sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on the contrary, an inordinate

thirst for inflicting pain on others, a tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction

in hostile deeds and ideas. Christianity had to embrace barbaric concepts and

valuations  in  order  to  obtain  mastery  over  barbarians:  of  such  sort,  for

example,  are  the  sacrifices  of  the  first-born,  the  drinking  of  blood  as  a

sacrament, the disdain of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its forms,

whether bodily or not; the whole pomp of the cult. Buddhism is a religion for

peoples in a further state of development, for races that have become kind,

gentle  and  over-spiritualized  (--Europe  is  not  yet  ripe  for  it--):  it  is  a

summons  that  takes  them  back  to  peace  and  cheerfulness,  to  a  careful

rationing of the spirit, to a certain hardening of the body. Christianity aims at

mastering beasts of prey; its modus operandi is to make them ill--to make

feeble  is  the  Christian  recipe  for  taming,  for  "civilizing."  Buddhism  is  a

religion  for  the  closing,  over-wearied  stages  of  civilization.  Christianity

appears  before  civilization  has  so  much  as  begun--under  certain

circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof.

  23.

    Buddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times more austere, more honest, more

objective. It no longer has to justify its pains, its susceptibility to suffering,

by interpreting these things in terms of sin--it simply says, as it simply thinks,

"I  suffer."  To  the  barbarian,  however,  suffering  in  itself  is  scarcely

understandable: what he needs, first of all, is an explanation as to why he

suffers. (His mere instinct prompts him to deny his suffering altogether, or to

endure it in silence.) Here the word "devil" was a blessing: man had to have

an  omnipotent  and  terrible  enemy--there  was  no  need  to  be  ashamed  of

suffering at the hands of such an enemy.--

  At the bottom of Christianity there are several subtleties that belong to the

Orient. In the first place, it knows that it is of very little consequence whethera thing be true or not, so long as it is believed to be true. Truth and faith: here

we  have  two  wholly  distinct  worlds  of  ideas,  almost  two  diametrically

opposite worlds--the road to the one and the road to the other lie miles apart.

To understand that fact thoroughly--this is almost enough, in the Orient, to

make one a sage. The Brahmins knew it, Plato knew it, every student of the

esoteric knows it. When, for example, a man gets any pleasure out of the

notion that he has been saved from sin, it is not necessary for him to be

actually sinful, but merely to feel sinful. But when faith is thus exalted above

everything  else,  it  necessarily  follows  that  reason,  knowledge  and  patient

inquiry have to be discredited: the road to the truth becomes a forbidden

road.--Hope, in its stronger forms, is a great deal more powerful stimulans to

life  than  any  sort  of  realized  joy  can  ever  be.  Man  must  be  sustained  in

suffering by a hope so high that no conflict with actuality can dash it--so

high, indeed, that no fulfilment can satisfy it: a hope reaching out beyond this

world. (Precisely because of this power that hope has of making the suffering

hold out, the Greeks regarded it as the evil of evils, as the most malign of

evils; it remained behind at the source of all evil.)[3]--In order that love may

be possible, God must become a person; in order that the lower instincts may

take a hand in the matter God must be young. To satisfy the ardor of the

woman a beautiful saint must appear on the scene, and to satisfy that of the

men there must be a virgin. These things are necessary if Christianity is to

assume lordship over a soil on which some aphrodisiacal or Adonis cult has

already established a notion as to what a cult ought to be. To insist upon

chastity greatly strengthens the vehemence and subjectivity of the religious

instinct--it makes the cult warmer, more enthusiastic, more soulful.--Love is

the state in which man sees things most decidedly as they are not. The force

of illusion reaches its highest here, and so does the capacity for sweetening,

for transfiguring. When a man is in love he endures more than at any other

time; he submits to anything. The problem was to devise a religion which

would allow one to love: by this means the worst that life has to offer is

overcome--it  is  scarcely  even  noticed.--So  much  for  the  three  Christian

virtues: faith, hope and charity: I call them the three Christian ingenuities.--

Buddhism is in too late a stage of development, too full of positivism, to be

shrewd in any such way.--

  [3] That is, in Pandora's box.

  24.

  Here I barely touch upon the problem of the origin of Christianity. Thefirst thing necessary to its solution is this: that Christianity is to be understood

only by examining the soil from which it sprung--it is not a reaction against

Jewish instincts; it is their inevitable product; it is simply one more step in

the awe-inspiring logic of the Jews. In the words of the Saviour, "salvation is

of the Jews."[4]--The second thing to remember is this: that the psychological

type of the Galilean is still to be recognized, but it was only in its most

degenerate  form  (which  is  at  once  maimed  and  overladen  with  foreign

features) that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used: as a type

of the Saviour of mankind.--

  [4] John iv, 22.

  The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for

when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they chose,

with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be at any price: this price involved a

radical falsification of all nature, of all naturalness, of all reality, of the whole

inner world, as well as of the outer. They put themselves against all those

conditions under which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even

been permitted to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood in

direct opposition to natural conditions--one by one they distorted religion,

civilization,  morality,  history  and  psychology  until  each  became  a

contradiction of its natural significance. We meet with the same phenomenon

later  on,  in  an  incalculably  exaggerated  form,  but  only  as  a  copy:  the

Christian church, put beside the "people of God," shows a complete lack of

any claim to originality. Precisely for this reason the Jews are the most fateful

people  in  the  history  of  the  world:  their  influence  has  so  falsified  the

reasoning of mankind in this matter that today the Christian can cherish anti-

Semitism without realizing that it is no more than the final consequence of

Judaism.

  In my "Genealogy of Morals" I give the first psychological explanation of

the concepts underlying those two antithetical things, a noble morality and a

ressentiment morality, the second of which is a mere product of the denial of

the  former.  The  Judaeo-Christian  moral  system  belongs  to  the  second

division, and in every detail. In order to be able to say Nay to everything

representing an ascending evolution of life--that is, to well-being, to power,

to  beauty,  to  self-approval--the  instincts  of  ressentiment,  here  become

downright genius, had to invent an other world in which the acceptance of

life  appeared  as  the  most  evil  and  abominable  thing  imaginable.

Psychologically, the Jews are a people gifted with the very strongest vitality,so much so that when they found themselves facing impossible conditions of

life they chose voluntarily, and with a profound talent for self-preservation,

the side of all those instincts which make for decadence--not as if mastered

by them, but as if detecting in them a power by which "the world" could be

defied. The Jews are the very opposite of decadents: they have simply been

forced into appearing in that guise, and with a degree of skill approaching the

non plus ultra of histrionic genius they have managed to put themselves at the

head of all decadent movements (--for example, the Christianity of Paul--),

and so make of them something stronger than any party frankly saying Yes to

life.  To  the  sort  of  men  who  reach  out  for  power  under  Judaism  and

Christianity,--that is to say, to the priestly class--decadence is no more than a

means to an end. Men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind

sick, and in confusing the values of "good" and "bad," "true" and "false" in a

manner that is not only dangerous to life, but also slanders it.

  25.

  The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt to

denaturize  all  natural  values:  I  point  to  five  facts  which  bear  this  out.

Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel maintained the

right attitude of things, which is to say, the natural attitude. Its Jahveh was an

expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself:

to  him  the  Jews  looked  for  victory  and  salvation  and  through  him  they

expected  nature  to  give  them  whatever  was  necessary  to  their  existence--

above  all,  rain.  Jahveh  is  the  god  of  Israel,  and  consequently  the  god  of

justice: this is the logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good

conscience  in  the  use  of  it.  In  the  religious  ceremonial  of  the  Jews  both

aspects of this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high

destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the benign

procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its herds and its

crops.--This view of things remained an ideal for a long while, even after it

had been robbed of validity by tragic blows: anarchy within and the Assyrian

without.  But  the  people  still  retained,  as  a  projection  of  their  highest

yearnings, that vision of a king who was at once a gallant warrior and an

upright judge--a vision best visualized in the typical prophet (i. e., critic and

satirist of the moment), Isaiah.--But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old

god  no  longer  could  do  what  he  used  to  do.  He  ought  to  have  been

abandoned. But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him

was changed--the conception of him was denaturized; this was the price thathad to be paid for keeping him.--Jahveh, the god of "justice"--he is in accord

with Israel no more, he no longer vizualizes the national egoism; he is now a

god only conditionally.... The public notion of this god now becomes merely

a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who interpret all happiness as a

reward and all unhappiness as a punishment for obedience or disobedience to

him, for "sin": that most fraudulent of all imaginable interpretations, whereby

a "moral order of the world" is set up, and the fundamental concepts, "cause"

and "effect," are stood on their heads. Once natural causation has been swept

out of the world by doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of un-

natural causation becomes necessary: and all other varieties of the denial of

nature follow it. A god who demands--in place of a god who helps, who gives

counsel,  who  is  at  bottom  merely  a  name  for  every  happy  inspiration  of

courage  and  self-reliance....  Morality  is  no  longer  a  reflection  of  the

conditions which make for the sound life and development of the people; it is

no  longer  the  primary  life-instinct;  instead  it  has  become  abstract  and  in

opposition to life--a fundamental perversion of the fancy, an "evil eye" on all

things.  What  is  Jewish,  what  is  Christian  morality?  Chance  robbed  of  its

innocence;  unhappiness  polluted  with  the  idea  of  "sin";  well-being

represented as a danger, as a "temptation"; a physiological disorder produced

by the canker worm of conscience....

  26.

  The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;--but even

here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel ceased to be

of  any  value:  out  with  it!--These  priests  accomplished  that  miracle  of

falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the documentary evidence;

with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the face of all tradition and all

historical reality, they translated the past of their people into religious terms,

which is to say, they converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation,

whereby all offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him

was  rewarded.  We  would  regard  this  act  of  historical  falsification  as

something  far  more  shameful  if  familiarity  with  the  ecclesiastical

interpretation  of  history  for  thousands  of  years  had  not  blunted  our

inclinations for uprightness in historicis. And the philosophers support the

church: the lie about a "moral order of the world" runs through the whole of

philosophy, even the newest. What is the meaning of a "moral order of the

world"? That there is a thing called the will of God which, once and for all

time, determines what man ought to do and what he ought not to do; that theworth of a people, or of an individual thereof, is to be measured by the extent

to which they or he obey this will of God; that the destinies of a people or of

an individual are controlled by this will of God, which rewards or punishes

according to the degree of obedience manifested.--In place of all that pitiable

lie reality has this to say: the priest, a parasitical variety of man who can exist

only at the cost of every sound view of life, takes the name of God in vain: he

calls that state of human society in which he himself determines the value of

all things "the kingdom of God"; he calls the means whereby that state of

affairs is attained "the will of God"; with cold-blooded cynicism he estimates

all peoples, all ages and all individuals by the extent of their subservience or

opposition to the power of the priestly order. One observes him at work:

under the hand of the Jewish priesthood the great age of Israel became an age

of decline; the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was transformed into

a punishment for that great age--during which priests had not yet come into

existence. Out of the powerful and wholly free heroes of Israel's history they

fashioned,  according  to  their  changing  needs,  either  wretched  bigots  and

hypocrites or men entirely "godless." They reduced every great event to the

idiotic formula: "obedient or disobedient to God."--They went a step further:

the "will of God" (in other words some means necessary for preserving the

power of the priests) had to be determined--and to this end they had to have a

"revelation." In plain English, a gigantic literary fraud had to be perpetrated,

and  "holy  scriptures"  had  to  be  concocted--and  so,  with  the  utmost

hierarchical pomp, and days of penance and much lamentation over the long

days of "sin" now ended, they were duly published. The "will of God," it

appears,  had  long  stood  like  a  rock;  the  trouble  was  that  mankind  had

neglected the "holy scriptures".... But the "will of God" had already been

revealed to Moses.... What happened? Simply this: the priest had formulated,

once and for all time and with the strictest meticulousness, what tithes were

to be paid to him, from the largest to the smallest (--not forgetting the most

appetizing cuts of meat, for the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks); in

brief, he let it be known just what he wanted, what "the will of God" was....

From  this  time  forward  things  were  so  arranged  that  the  priest  became

indispensable everywhere; at all the great natural events of life, at birth, at

marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the "sacrifice" (that is, at meal-

times), the holy parasite put in his appearance, and proceeded to denaturize it-

-in his own phrase, to "sanctify" it.... For this should be noted: that every

natural habit, every natural institution (the state, the administration of justice,marriage, the care of the sick and of the poor), everything demanded by the

life-instinct, in short, everything that has any value in itself, is reduced to

absolute  worthlessness  and  even  made  the  reverse  of  valuable  by  the

parasitism of priests (or, if you chose, by the "moral order of the world"). The

fact requires a sanction--a power to grant values becomes necessary, and the

only  way  it  can  create  such  values  is  by  denying  nature....  The  priest

depreciates and desecrates nature: it is only at this price that he can exist at

all.--Disobedience to God, which actually means to the priest, to "the law,"

now gets the name of "sin"; the means prescribed for "reconciliation with

God" are, of course, precisely the means which bring one most effectively

under  the  thumb  of  the  priest;  he  alone  can  "save"....  Psychologically

considered,  "sins"  are  indispensable  to  every  society  organized  on  an

ecclesiastical basis; they are the only reliable weapons of power; the priest

lives upon sins; it is necessary to him that there be "sinning".... Prime axiom:

"God forgiveth him that repenteth"--in plain English, him that submitteth to

the priest.

  27.

    Christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything natural,

every natural value, every reality was opposed by the deepest instincts of the

ruling class--it grew up as a sort of war to the death upon reality, and as such

it has never been surpassed. The "holy people," who had adopted priestly

values  and  priestly  names  for  all  things,  and  who,  with  a  terrible  logical

consistency,  had  rejected  everything  of  the  earth  as  "unholy,"  "worldly,"

"sinful"--this people put its instinct into a final formula that was logical to the

point of self-annihilation: as Christianity it actually denied even the last form

of reality, the "holy people," the "chosen people," Jewish reality itself. The

phenomenon  is  of  the  first  order  of  importance:  the  small  insurrectionary

movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth is simply the Jewish

instinct redivivus--in other words, it is the priestly instinct come to such a

pass that it can no longer endure the priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a

state of existence even more fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life

even  more  unreal  than  that  necessary  to  an  ecclesiastical  organization.

Christianity actually denies the church....

  I am unable to determine what was the target of the insurrection said to

have been led (whether rightly or wrongly) by Jesus, if it was not the Jewish

church--"church" being here used in exactly the same sense that the word has

today.  It  was  an  insurrection  against  the  "good  and  just,"  against  the"prophets  of  Israel,"  against  the  whole  hierarchy  of  society--not  against

corruption, but against caste, privilege, order, formalism. It was unbelief in

"superior men," a Nay flung at everything that priests and theologians stood

for. But the hierarchy that was called into question, if only for an instant, by

this  movement  was  the  structure  of  piles  which,  above  everything,  was

necessary to the safety of the Jewish people in the midst of the "waters"--it

represented their last possibility of survival; it was the final residuum of their

independent political existence; an attack upon it was an attack upon the most

profound national instinct, the most powerful national will to live, that has

ever appeared on earth. This saintly anarchist, who aroused the people of the

abyss, the outcasts and "sinners," the Chandala of Judaism, to rise in revolt

against the established order of things--and in language which, if the Gospels

are  to  be  credited,  would  get  him  sent  to  Siberia  today--this  man  was

certainly a political criminal, at least in so far as it was possible to be one in

so absurdly unpolitical a community. This is what brought him to the cross:

the proof thereof is to be found in the inscription that was put upon the cross.

He died for his own sins--there is not the slightest ground for believing, no

matter how often it is asserted, that he died for the sins of others.--

  28.

  As to whether he himself was conscious of this contradiction--whether, in

fact, this was the only contradiction he was cognizant of--that is quite another

question. Here, for the first time, I touch upon the problem of the psychology

of the Saviour.--I confess, to begin with, that there are very few books which

offer me harder reading than the Gospels. My difficulties are quite different

from  those  which  enabled  the  learned  curiosity  of  the  German  mind  to

achieve one of its most unforgettable triumphs. It is a long while since I, like

all  other  young  scholars,  enjoyed  with  all  the  sapient  laboriousness  of  a

fastidious philologist the work of the incomparable Strauss.[5] At that time I

was twenty years old: now I am too serious for that sort of thing. What do I

care for the contradictions of "tradition"? How can any one call pious legends

"traditions"?  The  histories  of  saints  present  the  most  dubious  variety  of

literature in existence; to examine them by the scientific method, in the entire

absence  of  corroborative  documents,  seems  to  me  to  condemn  the  whole

inquiry from the start--it is simply learned idling....

  [5] David Friedrich Strauss (1808-74), author of "Das Leben Jesu" (1835-

6), a very famous work in its day. Nietzsche here refers to it.

  29.  What concerns me is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type

might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and however

much overladen with extraneous characters--that is, in spite of the Gospels;

just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in his legends in spite of his

legends. It is not a question of mere truthful evidence as to what he did, what

he said and how he actually died; the question is, whether his type is still

conceivable, whether it has been handed down to us.--All the attempts that I

know of to read the history of a "soul" in the Gospels seem to me to reveal

only  a  lamentable  psychological  levity.  M.  Renan,  that  mountebank  in

psychologicus,  has  contributed  the  two  most  unseemly  notions  to  this

business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the genius and that of

the hero ("heros"). But if there is anything essentially unevangelical, it is

surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels make instinctive is precisely

the reverse of all heroic struggle, of all taste for conflict: the very incapacity

for resistance is here converted into something moral: ("resist not evil!"--the

most profound sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit,

the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the inability to be an enemy. What is

the meaning of "glad tidings"?--The true life, the life eternal has been found--

it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in you; it is the life that lies in love

free from all retreats and exclusions, from all keeping of distances. Every one

is the child of God--Jesus claims nothing for himself alone--as the child of

God each man is the equal of every other man.... Imagine making Jesus a

hero!--And  what  a  tremendous  misunderstanding  appears  in  the  word

"genius"! Our whole conception of the "spiritual," the whole conception of

our civilization, could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in.

In the strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be used

here.... We all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the tactile nerves

which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every touch, and from

every effort to grasp a solid object. Brought to its logical conclusion, such a

physiological habitus becomes an instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into

the "intangible," into the "incomprehensible"; a distaste for all formulae, for

all  conceptions  of  time  and  space,  for  everything  established--customs,

institutions, the church--; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no

sort of reality survives, a merely "inner" world, a "true" world, an "eternal"

world.... "The Kingdom of God is within you"....

  30.

  The  instinctive  hatred  of  reality:  the  consequence  of  an  extremesusceptibility  to  pain  and  irritation--so  great  that  merely  to  be  "touched"

becomes unendurable, for every sensation is too profound.

  The  instinctive  exclusion  of  all  aversion,  all  hostility,  all  bounds  and

distances in feeling: the consequence of an extreme susceptibility to pain and

irritation--so great that it senses all resistance, all compulsion to resistance, as

unbearable anguish (--that is to say, as harmful, as prohibited by the instinct

of self-preservation), and regards blessedness (joy) as possible only when it is

no longer necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything, however evil

or dangerous--love, as the only, as the ultimate possibility of life....

  These  are  the  two  physiological  realities  upon  and  out  of  which  the

doctrine of salvation has sprung. I call them a sublime super-development of

hedonism  upon  a  thoroughly  unsalubrious  soil.  What  stands  most  closely

related to them, though with a large admixture of Greek vitality and nerve-

force, is epicureanism, the theory of salvation of paganism. Epicurus was a

typical decadent: I was the first to recognize him.--The fear of pain, even of

infinitely slight pain--the end of this can be nothing save a religion of love....

  31.

  I have already given my answer to the problem. The prerequisite to it is

the assumption that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in a greatly

distorted form. This distortion is very probable: there are many reasons why a

type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure form, complete and free

of additions. The milieu in which this strange figure moved must have left

marks upon him, and more must have been imprinted by the history, the

destiny,  of  the  early  Christian  communities;  the  latter  indeed,  must  have

embellished the type retrospectively with characters which can be understood

only as serving the purposes of war and of propaganda. That strange and

sickly world into which the Gospels lead us--a world apparently out of a

Russian novel, in which the scum of society, nervous maladies and "childish"

idiocy  keep  a  tryst--must,  in  any  case,  have  coarsened  the  type:  the  first

disciples, in particular, must have been forced to translate an existence visible

only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their own crudity, in order to

understand it at all--in their sight the type could take on reality only after it

had been recast in a familiar mould.... The prophet, the messiah, the future

judge, the teacher of morals, the worker of wonders, John the Baptist--all

these  merely  presented  chances  to  misunderstand  it....  Finally,  let  us  not

underrate the proprium of all great, and especially all sectarian veneration: it

tends  to  erase  from  the  venerated  objects  all  its  original  traits  andidiosyncrasies, often so painfully strange--it does not even see them. It is

greatly to be regretted that no Dostoyevsky lived in the neighbourhood of this

most  interesting  decadent--I  mean  some  one  who  would  have  felt  the

poignant  charm  of  such  a  compound  of  the  sublime,  the  morbid  and  the

childish.  In  the  last  analysis,  the  type,  as  a  type  of  the  decadence,  may

actually have been peculiarly complex and contradictory: such a possibility is

not to be lost sight of. Nevertheless, the probabilities seem to be against it, for

in that case tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective,

whereas we have reasons for assuming the contrary. Meanwhile, there is a

contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount, the sea-shore and

the fields, who appears like a new Buddha on a soil very unlike India's, and

the aggressive fanatic, the mortal enemy of theologians and ecclesiastics, who

stands glorified by Renan's malice as "le grand ma�tre en ironie." I myself

haven't any doubt that the greater part of this venom (and no less of esprit)

got itself into the concept of the Master only as a result of the excited nature

of  Christian  propaganda:  we  all  know  the  unscrupulousness  of  sectarians

when they set out to turn their leader into an apologia for themselves. When

the  early  Christians  had  need  of  an  adroit,  contentious,  pugnacious  and

maliciously  subtle  theologian  to  tackle  other  theologians,  they  created  a

"god" that met that need, just as they put into his mouth without hesitation

certain ideas that were necessary to them but that were utterly at odds with

the  Gospels--"the  second  coming,"  "the  last  judgment,"  all  sorts  of

expectations and promises, current at the time.--

  32.

  I can only repeat that I set myself against all efforts to intrude the fanatic

into the figure of the Saviour: the very word imperieux, used by Renan, is

alone enough to annul the type. What the "glad tidings" tell us is simply that

there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of heaven belongs to children;

the faith that is voiced here is no more an embattled faith--it is at hand, it has

been from the beginning, it is a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit.

The  physiologists,  at  all  events,  are  familiar  with  such  a  delayed  and

incomplete puberty in the living organism, the result of degeneration. A faith

of this sort is not furious, it does not denounce, it does not defend itself: it

does not come with "the sword"--it does not realize how it will one day set

man against man. It does not manifest itself either by miracles, or by rewards

and promises, or by "scriptures": it is itself, first and last, its own miracle, its

own reward, its own promise, its own "kingdom of God." This faith does notformulate itself--it simply lives, and so guards itself against formulae. To be

sure,  the  accident  of  environment,  of  educational  background  gives

prominence to concepts of a certain sort: in primitive Christianity one finds

only concepts of a Judaeo-Semitic character (--that of eating and drinking at

the last supper belongs to this category--an idea which, like everything else

Jewish, has been badly mauled by the church). But let us be careful not to see

in  all  this  anything  more  than  symbolical  language,  semantics[6]  an

opportunity to speak in parables. It is only on the theory that no work is to be

taken literally that this anti-realist is able to speak at all. Set down among

Hindus he would have made use of the concepts of Sankhya,[7] and among

Chinese he would have employed those of Lao-tse[8]--and in neither case

would it have made any difference to him.--With a little freedom in the use of

words, one might actually call Jesus a "free spirit"[9]--he cares nothing for

what is established: the word killeth,[10] whatever is established killeth. The

idea of "life" as an experience, as he alone conceives it, stands opposed to his

mind to every sort of word, formula, law, belief and dogma. He speaks only

of inner things: "life" or "truth" or "light" is his word for the innermost--in his

sight  everything  else,  the  whole  of  reality,  all  nature,  even  language,  has

significance only as sign, as allegory.--Here it is of paramount importance to

be  led  into  no  error  by  the  temptations  lying  in  Christian,  or  rather

ecclesiastical prejudices: such a symbolism par excellence stands outside all

religion, all notions of worship, all history, all natural science, all worldly

experience, all knowledge, all politics, all psychology, all books, all art--his

"wisdom" is precisely a pure ignorance[11] of all such things. He has never

heard of culture; he doesn't have to make war on it--he doesn't even deny it....

The same thing may be said of the state, of the whole bourgeoise social order,

of labour, of war--he has no ground for denying "the world," for he knows

nothing of the ecclesiastical concept of "the world".... Denial is precisely the

thing that is impossible to him.--In the same way he lacks argumentative

capacity,  and  has  no  belief  that  an  article  of  faith,  a  "truth,"  may  be

established by proofs (--his proofs are inner "lights," subjective sensations of

happiness and self-approval, simple "proofs of power"--). Such a doctrine

cannot contradict: it doesn't know that other doctrines exist, or can exist, and

is wholly incapable of imagining anything opposed to it.... If anything of the

sort is ever encountered, it laments the "blindness" with sincere sympathy--

for it alone has "light"--but it does not offer objections....

  33.

  In  the  whole  psychology  of  the  "Gospels"  the  concepts  of  guilt  and

punishment  are  lacking,  and  so  is  that  of  reward.  "Sin,"  which  means

anything  that  puts  a  distance  between  God  and  man,  is  abolished--this  is

precisely the "glad tidings." Eternal bliss is not merely promised, nor is it

bound up with conditions: it is conceived as the only reality--what remains

consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it.

  The results of such a point of view project themselves into a new way of

life, the special evangelical way of life. It is not a "belief" that marks off the

Christian;  he  is  distinguished  by  a  different  mode  of  action;  he  acts

differently. He offers no resistance, either by word or in his heart, to those

who  stand  against  him.  He  draws  no  distinction  between  strangers  and

countrymen,  Jews  and  Gentiles  ("neighbour,"  of  course,  means  fellow-

believer, Jew). He is angry with no one, and he despises no one. He neither

appeals to the courts of justice nor heeds their mandates ("Swear not at all").

[12] He never under any circumstances divorces his wife, even when he has

proofs of her infidelity.--And under all of this is one principle; all of it arises

from one instinct.--

  [12] Matthew v, 34.

  The life of the Saviour was simply a carrying out of this way of life--and

so was his death.... He no longer needed any formula or ritual in his relations

with God--not even prayer. He had rejected the whole of the Jewish doctrine

of repentance and atonement; he knew that it was only by a way of life that

one could feel one's self "divine," "blessed," "evangelical," a "child of God."

Not by "repentance," not by "prayer and forgiveness" is the way to God: only

the Gospel way leads to God--it is itself "God!"--What the Gospels abolished

was  the  Judaism  in  the  concepts  of  "sin,"  "forgiveness  of  sin,"  "faith,"

"salvation through faith"--the whole ecclesiastical dogma of the Jews was

denied by the "glad tidings."

  The deep instinct which prompts the Christian how to live so that he willfeel that he is "in heaven" and is "immortal," despite many reasons for feeling

that  he  is  not  "in  heaven":  this  is  the  only  psychological  reality  in

"salvation."--A new way of life, not a new faith....

  34.

  If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this: that he

regarded  only  subjective  realities  as  realities,  as  "truths"--that  he  saw

everything else, everything natural, temporal, spatial and historical, merely as

signs, as materials for parables. The concept of "the Son of God" does not

connote a concrete person in history, an isolated and definite individual, but

an "eternal" fact, a psychological symbol set free from the concept of time.

The same thing is true, and in the highest sense, of the God of this typical

symbolist, of the "kingdom of God," and of the "sonship of God." Nothing

could be more un-Christian than the crude ecclesiastical notions of God as a

person, of a "kingdom of God" that is to come, of a "kingdom of heaven"

beyond, and of a "son of God" as the second person of the Trinity. All this--if

I may be forgiven the phrase--is like thrusting one's fist into the eye (and

what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect for symbols amounting to world-

historical cynicism.... But it is nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by

the symbols "Father" and "Son"--not, of course, to every one--: the word

"Son"  expresses  entrance  into  the  feeling  that  there  is  a  general

transformation of all things (beatitude), and "Father" expresses that feeling

itself--the sensation of eternity and of perfection.--I am ashamed to remind

you  of  what  the  church  has  made  of  this  symbolism:  has  it  not  set  an

Amphitryon story[13] at the threshold of the Christian "faith"? And a dogma

of "immaculate conception" for good measure?... And thereby it has robbed

conception of its immaculateness--

  [13] Amphitryon was the son of Alcaeus, King of Tiryns. His wife was

Alcmene. During his absence she was visited by Zeus, and bore Heracles.

  The "kingdom of heaven" is a state of the heart--not something to come

"beyond the world" or "after death." The whole idea of natural death is absent

from the Gospels: death is not a bridge, not a passing; it is absent because it

belongs  to  a  quite  different,  a  merely  apparent  world,  useful  only  as  a

symbol.  The  "hour  of  death"  is  not  a  Christian  idea--"hours,"  time,  the

physical life and its crises have no existence for the bearer of "glad tidings."...

The  "kingdom  of  God"  is  not  something  that  men  wait  for:  it  had  no

yesterday  and  no  day  after  tomorrow,  it  is  not  going  to  come  at  a

"millennium"--it  is  an  experience  of  the  heart,  it  is  everywhere  and  it  isnowhere....

  35.

  This "bearer of glad tidings" died as he lived and taught--not to "save

mankind," but to show mankind how to live. It was a way of life that he

bequeathed  to  man:  his  demeanour  before  the  judges,  before  the  officers,

before his accusers--his demeanour on the cross. He does not resist; he does

not  defend  his  rights;  he  makes  no  effort  to  ward  off  the  most  extreme

penalty--more, he invites it.... And he prays, suffers and loves with those, in

those, who do him evil.... Not to defend one's self, not to show anger, not to

lay blames.... On the contrary, to submit even to the Evil One--to love him....

  36.

  --We free spirits--we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite to

understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood--that instinct and

passion for integrity which makes war upon the "holy lie" even more than

upon all other lies.... Mankind was unspeakably far from our benevolent and

cautious  neutrality,  from  that  discipline  of  the  spirit  which  alone  makes

possible the solution of such strange and subtle things: what men always

sought,  with  shameless  egoism,  was  their  own  advantage  therein;  they

created the church out of denial of the Gospels....

  Whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinity's hand in the great drama

of  existence  would  find  no  small  indication  thereof  in  the  stupendous

question-mark  that  is  called  Christianity.  That  mankind  should  be  on  its

knees before the very antithesis of what was the origin, the meaning and the

law of the Gospels--that in the concept of the "church" the very things should

be pronounced holy that the "bearer of glad tidings" regards as beneath him

and behind him--it would be impossible to surpass this as a grand example of

world-historical irony--

  37.

  --Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude itself

into  believing  that  the  crude  fable  of  the  wonder-worker  and  Saviour

constituted the beginnings of Christianity--and that everything spiritual and

symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary, the whole history of

Christianity--from  the  death  on  the  cross  onward--is  the  history  of  a

progressively  clumsier  misunderstanding  of  an  original  symbolism.  With

every extension of Christianity among larger and ruder masses, even less

capable of grasping the principles that gave birth to it, the need arose to make

it more and more vulgar and barbarous--it absorbed the teachings and rites ofall  the  subterranean  cults  of  the  imperium  Romanum,  and  the  absurdities

engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning. It was the fate of Christianity that

its faith had to become as sickly, as low and as vulgar as the needs were

sickly,  low  and  vulgar  to  which  it  had  to  administer.  A  sickly  barbarism

finally  lifts  itself  to  power  as  the  church--the  church,  that  incarnation  of

deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the

spirit,  to  all  spontaneous  and  kindly  humanity.--Christian  values--noble

values: it is only we, we free spirits, who have re-established this greatest of

all antitheses in values!...

  38.

  --I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am visited by

a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy--contempt of man. Let me

leave no doubt as to what I despise, whom I despise: it is the man of today,

the man with whom I am unhappily contemporaneous. The man of today--I

am suffocated by his foul breath!... Toward the past, like all who understand,

I am full of tolerance, which is to say, generous self-control: with gloomy

caution I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it

"Christianity," "Christian faith" or the "Christian church," as you will--I take

care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But my feeling changes

and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern times, our times. Our

age knows better.... What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent-

-it is indecent to be a Christian today. And here my disgust begins.--I look

about me: not a word survives of what was once called "truth"; we can no

longer bear to hear a priest pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the

most modest pretensions to integrity must know that a theologian, a priest, a

pope of today not only errs when he speaks, but actually lies--and that he no

longer escapes blame for his lie through "innocence" or "ignorance." The

priest knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any "God," or any

"sinner," or any "Saviour"--that "free will" and the "moral order of the world"

are lies--: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the spirit, allow no

man to pretend that he does not know it.... All the ideas of the church are now

recognized for what they are--as the worst counterfeits in existence, invented

to  debase  nature  and  all  natural  values;  the  priest  himself  is  seen  as  he

actually is--as the most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of

creation.... We know, our conscience now knows--just what the real value of

all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they

have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution,the very sight of which excites loathing,--the concepts "the other world," "the

last judgment," "the immortality of the soul," the "soul" itself: they are all

merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest

becomes  master  and  remains  master....  Every  one  knows  this,  but

nevertheless things remain as before. What has become of the last trace of

decent  feeling,  of  self-respect,  when  our  statesmen,  otherwise  an

unconventional class of men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now

call themselves Christians and go to the communion-table?... A prince at the

head  of  his  armies,  magnificent  as  the  expression  of  the  egoism  and

arrogance of his people--and yet acknowledging, without any shame, that he

is a Christian!... Whom, then, does Christianity deny? what does it call "the

world"? To be a soldier, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to defend one's self; to

be careful of one's honour; to desire one's own advantage; to be proud ...

every act of everyday, every instinct, every valuation that shows itself in a

deed, is now anti-Christian: what a monster of falsehood the modern man

must be to call himself nevertheless, and without shame, a Christian!--

  39.

  --I shall go back a bit, and tell you the authentic history of Christianity.--

The very word "Christianity" is a misunderstanding--at bottom there was only

one Christian, and he died on the cross. The "Gospels" died on the cross.

What,  from  that  moment  onward,  was  called  the  "Gospels"  was  the  very

reverse of what he had lived: "bad tidings," a Dysangelium.[14] It is an error

amounting  to  nonsensicality  to  see  in  "faith,"  and  particularly  in  faith  in

salvation through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the

Christian  way  of  life,  the  life  lived  by  him  who  died  on  the  cross,  is

Christian.... To this day such a life is still possible, and for certain men even

necessary: genuine, primitive Christianity will remain possible in all ages....

Not  faith,  but  acts;  above  all,  an  avoidance  of  acts,  a  different  state  of

being.... States of consciousness, faith of a sort, the acceptance, for example,

of anything as true--as every psychologist knows, the value of these things is

perfectly indifferent and fifth-rate compared to that of the instincts: strictly

speaking, the whole concept of intellectual causality is false. To reduce being

a Christian, the state of Christianity, to an acceptance of truth, to a mere

phenomenon of consciousness, is to formulate the negation of Christianity. In

fact, there are no Christians. The "Christian"--he who for two thousand years

has passed as a Christian--is simply a psychological self-delusion. Closely

examined, it appears that, despite all his "faith," he has been ruled only by hisinstincts--and what instincts!--In all ages--for example, in the case of Luther--

"faith" has been no more than a cloak, a pretense, a curtain behind which the

instincts have played their game--a shrewd blindness to the domination of

certain of the instincts.... I have already called "faith" the specially Christian

form of shrewdness--people always talk of their "faith" and act according to

their instincts.... In the world of ideas of the Christian there is nothing that so

much as touches reality: on the contrary, one recognizes an instinctive hatred

of  reality  as  the  motive  power,  the  only  motive  power  at  the  bottom  of

Christianity. What follows therefrom? That even here, in psychologicis, there

is a radical error, which is to say one conditioning fundamentals, which is to

say, one in substance. Take away one idea and put a genuine reality in its

place--and  the  whole  of  Christianity  crumbles  to  nothingness!--Viewed

calmly, this strangest of all phenomena, a religion not only depending on

errors,  but  inventive  and  ingenious  only  in  devising  injurious  errors,

poisonous to life and to the heart--this remains a spectacle for the gods--for

those gods who are also philosophers, and whom I have encountered, for

example, in the celebrated dialogues at Naxos. At the moment when their

disgust  leaves  them  (--and  us!)  they  will  be  thankful  for  the  spectacle

afforded by the Christians: perhaps because of this curious exhibition alone

the  wretched  little  planet  called  the  earth  deserves  a  glance  from

omnipotence, a show of divine interest.... Therefore, let us not underestimate

the Christians: the Christian, false to the point of innocence, is far above the

ape--in  its  application  to  the  Christians  a  well-known  theory  of  descent

becomes a mere piece of politeness....

  [14]  So  in  the  text.  One  of  Nietzsche's  numerous  coinages,  obviously

suggested by Evangelium, the German for gospel.

  40.

  --The fate of the Gospels was decided by death--it hung on the "cross."...

It was only death, that unexpected and shameful death; it was only the cross,

which was usually reserved for the canaille only--it was only this appalling

paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the real riddle: "Who

was it? what was it?"--The feeling of dismay, of profound affront and injury;

the suspicion that such a death might involve a refutation of their cause; the

terrible question, "Why just in this way?"--this state of mind is only too easy

to  understand.  Here  everything  must  be  accounted  for  as  necessary;

everything must have a meaning, a reason, the highest sort of reason; the love

of a disciple excludes all chance. Only then did the chasm of doubt yawn:"Who put him to death? who was his natural enemy?"--this question flashed

like a lightning-stroke. Answer: dominant Judaism, its ruling class. From that

moment,  one  found  one's  self  in  revolt  against  the  established  order,  and

began to understand Jesus as in revolt against the established order. Until

then this militant, this nay-saying, nay-doing element in his character had

been  lacking;  what  is  more,  he  had  appeared  to  present  its  opposite.

Obviously, the little community had not understood what was precisely the

most important thing of all: the example offered by this way of dying, the

freedom  from  and  superiority  to  every  feeling  of  ressentiment--a  plain

indication of how little he was understood at all! All that Jesus could hope to

accomplish by his death, in itself, was to offer the strongest possible proof, or

example, of his teachings in the most public manner.... But his disciples were

very  far  from  forgiving  his  death--though  to  have  done  so  would  have

accorded  with  the  Gospels  in  the  highest  degree;  and  neither  were  they

prepared to offer themselves, with gentle and serene calmness of heart, for a

similar death.... On the contrary, it was precisely the most unevangelical of

feelings, revenge, that now possessed them. It seemed impossible that the

cause should perish with his death: "recompense" and "judgment" became

necessary  (--yet  what  could  be  less  evangelical  than  "recompense,"

"punishment," and "sitting in judgment"!). Once more the popular belief in

the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground; attention was rivetted

upon an historical moment: the "kingdom of God" is to come, with judgment

upon his enemies.... But in all this there was a wholesale misunderstanding:

imagine the "kingdom of God" as a last act, as a mere promise! The Gospels

had  been,  in  fact,  the  incarnation,  the  fulfilment,  the  realization  of  this

"kingdom of God." It was only now that all the familiar contempt for and

bitterness against Pharisees and theologians began to appear in the character

of the Master--he was thereby turned into a Pharisee and theologian himself!

On the other hand, the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced

souls could no longer endure the Gospel doctrine, taught by Jesus, of the

equal right of all men to be children of God: their revenge took the form of

elevating  Jesus  in  an  extravagant  fashion,  and  thus  separating  him  from

themselves: just as, in earlier times, the Jews, to revenge themselves upon

their enemies, separated themselves from their God, and placed him on a

great height. The One God and the Only Son of God: both were products of

ressentiment....

  41.  --And  from  that  time  onward  an  absurd  problem  offered  itself:  "how

could God allow it!" To which the deranged reason of the little community

formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity: God gave his son as

a  sacrifice  for  the  forgiveness  of  sins.  At  once  there  was  an  end  of  the

gospels! Sacrifice for sin, and in its most obnoxious and barbarous form:

sacrifice of the innocent for the sins of the guilty! What appalling paganism!-

-Jesus himself had done away with the very concept of "guilt," he denied that

there was any gulf fixed between God and man; he lived this unity between

God and man, and that was precisely his "glad tidings".... And not as a mere

privilege!--From this time forward the type of the Saviour was corrupted, bit

by bit, by the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming, the doctrine of

death as a sacrifice, the doctrine of the resurrection, by means of which the

entire concept of "blessedness," the whole and only reality of the gospels, is

juggled away--in favour of a state of existence after death!... St. Paul, with

that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in all his doings, gave a logical

quality to that conception, that indecent conception, in this way: "If Christ did

not  rise  from  the  dead,  then  all  our  faith  is  in  vain!"--And  at  once  there

sprang from the Gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises,

the shameless doctrine of personal immortality.... Paul even preached it as a

reward....

  42.

  One now begins to see just what it was that came to an end with the death

on  the  cross:  a  new  and  thoroughly  original  effort  to  found  a  Buddhistic

peace  movement,  and  so  establish  happiness  on  earth--real,  not  merely

promised.  For  this  remains--as  I  have  already  pointed  out--the  essential

difference  between  the  two  religions  of  decadence:  Buddhism  promises

nothing,  but  actually  fulfils;  Christianity  promises  everything,  but  fulfils

nothing.--Hard  upon  the  heels  of  the  "glad  tidings"  came  the  worst

imaginable:  those  of  Paul.  In  Paul  is  incarnated  the  very  opposite  of  the

"bearer of glad tidings"; he represents the genius for hatred, the vision of

hatred, the relentless logic of hatred. What, indeed, has not this dysangelist

sacrificed to hatred! Above all, the Saviour: he nailed him to his own cross.

The life, the example, the teaching, the death of Christ, the meaning and the

law of the whole gospels--nothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter

in hatred had reduced it to his uses. Surely not reality; surely not historical

truth!... Once more the priestly instinct of the Jew perpetrated the same old

master crime against history--he simply struck out the yesterday and the daybefore yesterday of Christianity, and invented his own history of Christian

beginnings.  Going  further,  he  treated  the  history  of  Israel  to  another

falsification, so that it became a mere prologue to his achievement: all the

prophets,  it  now  appeared,  had  referred  to  his  "Saviour."...  Later  on  the

church even falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to

Christianity.... The figure of the Saviour, his teaching, his way of life, his

death, the meaning of his death, even the consequences of his death--nothing

remained untouched, nothing remained in even remote contact with reality.

Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that whole life to a place behind

this existence--in the lie of the "risen" Jesus. At bottom, he had no use for the

life  of  the  Saviour--what  he  needed  was  the  death  on  the  cross,  and

something more. To see anything honest in such a man as Paul, whose home

was  at  the  centre  of  the  Stoical  enlightenment,  when  he  converts  an

hallucination  into  a  proof  of  the  resurrection  of  the  Saviour,  or  even  to

believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination himself--this would be

a genuine niaiserie in a psychologist. Paul willed the end; therefore he also

willed the means.... What he himself didn't believe was swallowed readily

enough by the idiots among whom he spread his teaching.--What he wanted

was power; in Paul the priest once more reached out for power--he had use

only  for  such  concepts,  teachings  and  symbols  as  served  the  purpose  of

tyrannizing over the masses and organizing mobs. What was the only part of

Christianity that Mohammed borrowed later on? Paul's invention, his device

for establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob: the belief in the

immortality of the soul--that is to say, the doctrine of "judgment"....

  43.

  When the centre of gravity of life is placed, not in life itself, but in "the

beyond"--in  nothingness--then  one  has  taken  away  its  centre  of  gravity

altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all reason, all natural

instinct--henceforth, everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters

life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life

no longer has any meaning: this is now the "meaning" of life.... Why be

public-spirited? Why take any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour

together, trust one another, or concern one's self about the common welfare,

and try to serve it?... Merely so many "temptations," so many strayings from

the  "straight  path."--"One  thing  only  is  necessary"....  That  every  man,

because he has an "immortal soul," is as good as every other man; that in an

infinite universe of things the "salvation" of every individual may lay claimto eternal importance; that insignificant bigots and the three-fourths insane

may assume that the laws of nature are constantly suspended in their behalf--

it is impossible to lavish too much contempt upon such a magnification of

every sort of selfishness to infinity, to insolence. And yet Christianity has to

thank precisely this miserable flattery of personal vanity for its triumph--it

was thus that it lured all the botched, the dissatisfied, the fallen upon evil

days,  the  whole  refuse  and  off-scouring  of  humanity  to  its  side.  The

"salvation of the soul"--in plain English: "the world revolves around me."...

The  poisonous  doctrine,  "equal  rights  for  all,"  has  been  propagated  as  a

Christian  principle:  out  of  the  secret  nooks  and  crannies  of  bad  instinct

Christianity  has  waged  a  deadly  war  upon  all  feelings  of  reverence  and

distance between man and man, which is to say, upon the first prerequisite to

every  step  upward,  to  every  development  of  civilization--out  of  the

ressentiment of the masses it has forged its chief weapons against us, against

everything noble, joyous and high-spirited on earth, against our happiness on

earth.... To allow "immortality" to every Peter and Paul was the greatest, the

most vicious outrage upon noble humanity ever perpetrated.--And let us not

underestimate  the  fatal  influence  that  Christianity  has  had,  even  upon

politics! Nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights, for the

right of dominion, for feelings of honourable pride in himself and his equals--

for the pathos of distance.... Our politics is sick with this lack of courage!--

The  aristocratic  attitude  of  mind  has  been  undermined  by  the  lie  of  the

equality of souls; and if belief in the "privileges of the majority" makes and

will continue to make revolutions--it is Christianity, let us not doubt, and

Christian valuations, which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood

and crime! Christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the ground

against everything that is lofty: the gospel of the "lowly" lowers....

  44.

  --The  gospels  are  invaluable  as  evidence  of  the  corruption  that  was

already persistent within the primitive community. That which Paul, with the

cynical logic of a rabbi, later developed to a conclusion was at bottom merely

a  process  of  decay  that  had  begun  with  the  death  of  the  Saviour.--These

gospels cannot be read too carefully; difficulties lurk behind every word. I

confess--I hope it will not be held against me--that it is precisely for this

reason that they offer first-rate joy to a psychologist--as the opposite of all

merely na�ve corruption, as refinement par excellence, as an artistic triumph

in psychological corruption. The gospels, in fact, stand alone. The Bible as awhole is not to be compared to them. Here we are among Jews: this is the

first thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the matter.

This  positive  genius  for  conjuring  up  a  delusion  of  personal  "holiness"

unmatched anywhere else, either in books or by men; this elevation of fraud

in word and attitude to the level of an art--all this is not an accident due to the

chance  talents  of  an  individual,  or  to  any  violation  of  nature.  The  thing

responsible is race. The whole of Judaism appears in Christianity as the art of

concocting  holy  lies,  and  there,  after  many  centuries  of  earnest  Jewish

training and hard practice of Jewish technic, the business comes to the stage

of mastery. The Christian, that ultima ratio of lying, is the Jew all over again-

-he is threefold the Jew.... The underlying will to make use only of such

concepts, symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly practice, the instinctive

repudiation  of  every  other  mode  of  thought,  and  every  other  method  of

estimating values and utilities--this is not only tradition, it is inheritance: only

as an inheritance is it able to operate with the force of nature. The whole of

mankind, even the best minds of the best ages (with one exception, perhaps

hardly human--), have permitted themselves to be deceived. The gospels have

been read as a book of innocence ... surely no small indication of the high

skill with which the trick has been done.--Of course, if we could actually see

these astounding bigots and bogus saints, even if only for an instant, the farce

would come to an end,--and it is precisely because I cannot read a word of

theirs without seeing their attitudinizing that I have made an end of them.... I

simply cannot endure the way they have of rolling up their eyes.--For the

majority, happily enough, books are mere literature.--Let us not be led astray:

they say "judge not," and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their

way. In letting God sit in judgment they judge themselves; in glorifying God

they glorify themselves; in demanding that every one show the virtues which

they themselves happen to be capable of--still more, which they must have in

order  to  remain  on  top--they  assume  the  grand  air  of  men  struggling  for

virtue, of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail. "We live, we die, we

sacrifice ourselves for the good" (--"the truth," "the light," "the kingdom of

God"): in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing. Forced,

like  hypocrites,  to  be  sneaky,  to  hide  in  corners,  to  slink  along  in  the

shadows, they convert their necessity into a duty: it is on grounds of duty that

they account for their lives of humility, and that humility becomes merely

one more proof of their piety.... Ah, that humble, chaste, charitable brand of

fraud! "Virtue itself shall bear witness for us."... One may read the gospels asbooks of moral seduction: these petty folks fasten themselves to morality--

they know the uses of morality! Morality is the best of all devices for leading

mankind by the nose!--The fact is that the conscious conceit of the chosen

here disguises itself as modesty: it is in this way that they, the "community,"

the "good and just," range themselves, once and for always, on one side, the

side of "the truth"--and the rest of mankind, "the world," on the other.... In

that we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever

seen: little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive rights in the

concepts of "God," "the truth," "the light," "the spirit," "love," "wisdom" and

"life,"  as  if  these  things  were  synonyms  of  themselves  and  thereby  they

sought to fence themselves off from the "world"; little super-Jews, ripe for

some sort of madhouse, turned values upside down in order to meet their

notions, just as if the Christian were the meaning, the salt, the standard and

even the last judgment of all the rest.... The whole disaster was only made

possible  by  the  fact  that  there  already  existed  in  the  world  a  similar

megalomania, allied to this one in race, to wit, the Jewish: once a chasm

began to yawn between Jews and Judaeo-Christians, the latter had no choice

but  to  employ  the  self-preservative  measures  that  the  Jewish  instinct  had

devised, even against the Jews themselves, whereas the Jews had employed

them only against non-Jews. The Christian is simply a Jew of the "reformed"

confession.--

  --I offer a few examples of the sort of thing these petty people have got

into  their  heads--what  they  have  put  into  the  mouth  of  the  Master:  the

unalloyed creed of "beautiful souls."--

  "And  whosoever  shall  not  receive  you,  nor  hear  you,  when  ye  depart

thence,  shake  off  the  dust  under  your  feet  for  a  testimony  against  them.

Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in

the day of judgment, than for that city" (Mark vi, 11)--How evangelical!...

  "And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it

is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were

cast into the sea" (Mark ix, 42).--How evangelical!...

  "And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into

the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell

fire; Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." (Mark ix, 47.

[15])--It is not exactly the eye that is meant....

  [15] To which, without mentioning it, Nietzsche adds verse 48.  "Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which

shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with

power." (Mark ix, 1.)--Well lied, lion![16]...

  [16] A paraphrase of Demetrius' "Well roar'd, Lion!" in act v, scene 1 of

"A Midsummer Night's Dream." The lion, of course, is the familiar Christian

symbol for Mark.

    "Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his

cross, and follow me. For..." (Note of a psychologist. Christian morality is

refuted by its fors: its reasons are against it,--this makes it Christian.) Mark

viii, 34.--

  "Judge not, that ye be not judged. With what measure ye mete, it shall be

measured to you again." (Matthew vii, 1.[17])--What a notion of justice, of a

"just" judge!...

  [17] Nietzsche also quotes part of verse 2.

  "For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even

the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more

than others? do not even the publicans so?" (Matthew v, 46.[18])--Principle

of "Christian love": it insists upon being well paid in the end....

  [18] The quotation also includes verse 47.

  "But  if  ye  forgive  not  men  their  trespasses,  neither  will  your  Father

forgive your trespasses." (Matthew vi, 15.)--Very compromising for the said

"father."...

  "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all

these things shall be added unto you." (Matthew vi, 33.)--All these things:

namely, food, clothing, all the necessities of life. An error, to put it mildly....

A bit before this God appears as a tailor, at least in certain cases....

    "Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great

in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets." (Luke

vi, 23.)--Impudent rabble! It compares itself to the prophets....

  "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God

dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;

for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." (Paul, 1 Corinthians iii,

16.[19])--For that sort of thing one cannot have enough contempt....

  [19] And 17.

  "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world

shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?" (Paul,

1 Corinthians vi, 2.)--Unfortunately, not merely the speech of a lunatic....This  frightful  impostor  then  proceeds:  "Know  ye  not  that  we  shall  judge

angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"...

  "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in

the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by

the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.... Not many wise men

after the flesh, not men mighty, not many noble are called: But God hath

chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath

chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;

And  base  things  of  the  world,  and  things  which  are  despised,  hath  God

chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That

no flesh should glory in his presence." (Paul, 1 Corinthians i, 20ff.[20])--In

order  to  understand  this  passage,  a  first-rate  example  of  the  psychology

underlying  every  Chandala-morality,  one  should  read  the  first  part  of  my

"Genealogy of Morals": there, for the first time, the antagonism between a

noble  morality  and  a  morality  born  of  ressentiment  and  impotent

vengefulness is exhibited. Paul was the greatest of all apostles of revenge....

  [20] Verses 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29.

  46.

  --What follows, then? That one had better put on gloves before reading

the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very advisable.

One would as little choose "early Christians" for companions as Polish Jews:

not that one need seek out an objection to them.... Neither has a pleasant

smell.--I have searched the New Testament in vain for a single sympathetic

touch;  nothing  is  there  that  is  free,  kindly,  open-hearted  or  upright.  In  it

humanity  does  not  even  make  the  first  step  upward--the  instinct  for

cleanliness is lacking.... Only evil instincts are there, and there is not even the

courage of these evil instincts. It is all cowardice; it is all a shutting of the

eyes, a self-deception. Every other book becomes clean, once one has read

the New Testament: for example, immediately after reading Paul I took up

with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers, Petronius, of whom

one may say what Domenico Boccaccio wrote of C�sar Borgia to the Duke

of  Parma:  "�  tutto  festo"--immortally  healthy,  immortally  cheerful  and

sound.... These petty bigots make a capital miscalculation. They attack, but

everything they attack is thereby distinguished. Whoever is attacked by an

"early Christian" is surely not befouled.... On the contrary, it is an honour to

have  an  "early  Christian"  as  an  opponent.  One  cannot  read  the  New

Testament without acquired admiration for whatever it abuses--not to speakof the "wisdom of this world," which an impudent wind-bag tries to dispose

of "by the foolishness of preaching."... Even the scribes and pharisees are

benefitted  by  such  opposition:  they  must  certainly  have  been  worth

something to have been hated in such an indecent manner. Hypocrisy--as if

this were a charge that the "early Christians" dared to make!--After all, they

were the privileged, and that was enough: the hatred of the Chandala needed

no other excuse. The "early Christian"--and also, I fear, the "last Christian,"

whom I may perhaps live to see--is a rebel against all privilege by profound

instinct--he  lives  and  makes  war  for  ever  for  "equal  rights."...  Strictly

speaking, he has no alternative. When a man proposes to represent, in his

own person, the "chosen of God"--or to be a "temple of God," or a "judge of

the angels"--then every other criterion, whether based upon honesty, upon

intellect, upon manliness and pride, or upon beauty and freedom of the heart,

becomes simply "worldly"--evil in itself.... Moral: every word that comes

from the lips of an "early Christian" is a lie, and his every act is instinctively

dishonest--all  his  values,  all  his  aims  are  noxious,  but  whoever  he  hates,

whatever  he  hates,  has  real  value....  The  Christian,  and  particularly  the

Christian priest, is thus a criterion of values.

  --Must  I  add  that,  in  the  whole  New  Testament,  there  appears  but  a

solitary figure worthy of honour? Pilate, the Roman viceroy. To regard a

Jewish imbroglio seriously--that was quite beyond him. One Jew more or

less--what did it matter?... The noble scorn of a Roman, before whom the

word "truth" was shamelessly mishandled, enriched the New Testament with

the only saying that has any value--and that is at once its criticism and its

destruction: "What is truth?..."

  47.

  --The thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find God, either

in history, or in nature, or behind nature--but that we regard what has been

honoured as God, not as "divine," but as pitiable, as absurd, as injurious; not

as a mere error, but as a crime against life.... We deny that God is God.... If

any one were to show us this Christian God, we'd be still less inclined to

believe in him.--In a formula: deus, qualem Paulus creavit, dei negatio.--Such

a religion as Christianity, which does not touch reality at a single point and

which goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point, must

be inevitably the deadly enemy of the "wisdom of this world," which is to

say, of science--and it will give the name of good to whatever means serve to

poison, calumniate and cry down all intellectual discipline, all lucidity andstrictness in matters of intellectual conscience, and all noble coolness and

freedom of the mind. "Faith," as an imperative, vetoes science--in praxi, lying

at any price.... Paul well knew that lying--that "faith"--was necessary; later on

the church borrowed the fact from Paul.--The God that Paul invented for

himself,  a  God  who  "reduced  to  absurdity"  "the  wisdom  of  this  world"

(especially the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine), is

in truth only an indication of Paul's resolute determination to accomplish that

very thing himself: to give one's own will the name of God, thora--that is

essentially Jewish. Paul wants to dispose of the "wisdom of this world": his

enemies are the good philologians and physicians of the Alexandrine school--

on them he makes his war. As a matter of fact no man can be a philologian or

a physician without being also Antichrist. That is to say, as a philologian a

man sees behind the "holy books," and as a physician he sees behind the

physiological  degeneration  of  the  typical  Christian.  The  physician  says

"incurable"; the philologian says "fraud."...

  48.

  --Has  any  one  ever  clearly  understood  the  celebrated  story  at  the

beginning of the Bible--of God's mortal terror of science?... No one, in fact,

has understood it. This priest-book par excellence opens, as is fitting, with the

great  inner  difficulty  of  the  priest:  he  faces  only  one  great  danger;  ergo,

"God" faces only one great danger.--

  The old God, wholly "spirit," wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is

promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against boredom

even gods struggle in vain.[21] What does he do? He creates man--man is

entertaining.... But then he notices that man is also bored. God's pity for the

only  form  of  distress  that  invades  all  paradises  knows  no  bounds:  so  he

forthwith  creates  other  animals.  God's  first  mistake:  to  man  these  other

animals were not entertaining--he sought dominion over them; he did not

want  to  be  an  "animal"  himself.--So  God  created  woman.  In  the  act  he

brought boredom to an end--and also many other things! Woman was the

second  mistake  of  God.--"Woman,  at  bottom,  is  a  serpent,  Heva"--every

priest knows that; "from woman comes every evil in the world"--every priest

knows  that,  too.  Ergo,  she  is  also  to  blame  for  science....  It  was  through

woman that man learned to taste of the tree of knowledge.--What happened?

The old God was seized by mortal terror. Man himself had been his greatest

blunder; he had created a rival to himself; science makes men godlike--it is

all up with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!--Moral: science isthe forbidden per se; it alone is forbidden. Science is the first of sins, the

germ of all sins, the original sin. This is all there is of morality.--"Thou shall

not know":--the rest follows from that.--God's mortal terror, however, did not

hinder  him  from  being  shrewd.  How  is  one  to  protect  one's  self  against

science?  For  a  long  while  this  was  the  capital  problem.  Answer:  Out  of

paradise with man! Happiness, leisure, foster thought--and all thoughts are

bad thoughts!--Man must not think.--And so the priest invents distress, death,

the mortal dangers of childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude,

above  all,  sickness--nothing  but  devices  for  making  war  on  science!  The

troubles of man don't allow him to think.... Nevertheless--how terrible!--, the

edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft, invading heaven, shadowing the

gods--what  is  to  be  done?--The  old  God  invents  war;  he  separates  the

peoples; he makes men destroy one another (--the priests have always had

need  of  war....).  War--among  other  things,  a  great  disturber  of  science!--

Incredible!  Knowledge,  deliverance  from  the  priests,  prospers  in  spite  of

war.--So  the  old  God  comes  to  his  final  resolution:  "Man  has  become

scientific--there is no help for it: he must be drowned!"...

  [21] A paraphrase of Schiller's "Against stupidity even gods struggle in

vain."

  49.

  --I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is the whole

psychology of the priest.--The priest knows of only one great danger: that is

science--the sound comprehension of cause and effect. But science flourishes,

on the whole, only under favourable conditions--a man must have time, he

must have an overflowing intellect, in order to "know."... "Therefore, man

must be made unhappy,"--this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.--It

is easy to see just what, by this logic, was the first thing to come into the

world:--"sin."... The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole "moral order

of the world," was set up against science--against the deliverance of man

from priests.... Man must not look outward; he must look inward. He must

not look at things shrewdly and cautiously, to learn about them; he must not

look at all; he must suffer.... And he must suffer so much that he is always in

need of the priest.--Away with physicians! What is needed is a Saviour.--The

concept  of  guilt  and  punishment,  including  the  doctrines  of  "grace,"  of

"salvation,"  of  "forgiveness"--lies  through  and  through,  and  absolutely

without  psychological  reality--were  devised  to  destroy  man's  sense  of

causality: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and effect!--And notan attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty in hate and love! On the

contrary,  one  inspired  by  the  most  cowardly,  the  most  crafty,  the  most

ignoble  of  instincts!  An  attack  of  priests!  An  attack  of  parasites!  The

vampirism of pale, subterranean leeches!... When the natural consequences of

an act are no longer "natural," but are regarded as produced by the ghostly

creations of superstition--by "God," by "spirits," by "souls"--and reckoned as

merely  "moral"  consequences,  as  rewards,  as  punishments,  as  hints,  as

lessons, then the whole ground-work of knowledge is destroyed--then the

greatest of crimes against humanity has been perpetrated.--I repeat that sin,

man's self-desecration par excellence, was invented in order to make science,

culture, and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible; the priest rules

through the invention of sin.--

  50.

  --In this place I can't permit myself to omit a psychology of "belief," of

the "believer," for the special benefit of "believers." If there remain any today

who do not yet know how indecent it is to be "believing"--or how much a

sign  of  decadence,  of  a  broken  will  to  live--then  they  will  know  it  well

enough tomorrow. My voice reaches even the deaf.--It appears, unless I have

been  incorrectly  informed,  that  there  prevails  among  Christians  a  sort  of

criterion  of  truth  that  is  called  "proof  by  power."  "Faith  makes  blessed:

therefore it is true."--It might be objected right here that blessedness is not

demonstrated, it is merely promised: it hangs upon "faith" as a condition--one

shall be blessed because one believes.... But what of the thing that the priest

promises to the believer, the wholly transcendental "beyond"--how is that to

be demonstrated?--The "proof by power," thus assumed, is actually no more

at bottom than a belief that the effects which faith promises will not fail to

appear. In a formula: "I believe that faith makes for blessedness--therefore, it

is  true."...  But  this  is  as  far  as  we  may  go.  This  "therefore"  would  be

absurdum  itself  as  a  criterion  of  truth.--But  let  us  admit,  for  the  sake  of

politeness,  that  blessedness  by  faith  may  be  demonstrated  (--not  merely

hoped for, and not merely promised by the suspicious lips of a priest): even

so, could blessedness--in a technical term, pleasure--ever be a proof of truth?

So little is this true that it is almost a proof against truth when sensations of

pleasure influence the answer to the question "What is true?" or, at all events,

it is enough to make that "truth" highly suspicious. The proof by "pleasure" is

a proof of "pleasure"--nothing more; why in the world should it be assumed

that  true  judgments  give  more  pleasure  than  false  ones,  and  that,  inconformity  to  some  pre-established  harmony,  they  necessarily  bring

agreeable  feelings  in  their  train?--The  experience  of  all  disciplined  and

profound minds teaches the contrary. Man has had to fight for every atom of

the truth, and has had to pay for it almost everything that the heart, that

human love, that human trust cling to. Greatness of soul is needed for this

business: the service of truth is the hardest of all services.--What, then, is the

meaning  of  integrity  in  things  intellectual?  It  means  that  a  man  must  be

severe with his own heart, that he must scorn "beautiful feelings," and that he

makes  every  Yea  and  Nay  a  matter  of  conscience!--Faith  makes  blessed:

therefore, it lies....

  51.

  The  fact  that  faith,  under  certain  circumstances,  may  work  for

blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an idee fixe by no means

makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains,

but instead raises them up where there were none before: all this is made

sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic asylum. Not, of course, to a

priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and

lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums. Christianity finds sickness necessary,

just as the Greek spirit had need of a superabundance of health--the actual

ulterior purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to make

people ill. And the church itself--doesn't it set up a Catholic lunatic asylum as

the ultimate ideal?--The whole earth as a madhouse?--The sort of religious

man  that  the  church  wants  is  a  typical  decadent;  the  moment  at  which  a

religious crisis dominates a people is always marked by epidemics of nervous

disorder; the "inner world" of the religious man is so much like the "inner

world"  of  the  overstrung  and  exhausted  that  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish

between  them;  the  "highest"  states  of  mind,  held  up  before  mankind  by

Christianity as of supreme worth, are actually epileptoid in form--the church

has granted the name of holy only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds in majorem

dei honorem.... Once I ventured to designate the whole Christian system of

training[22]  in  penance  and  salvation  (now  best  studied  in  England)  as  a

method of producing a folie circulaire upon a soil already prepared for it,

which  is  to  say,  a  soil  thoroughly  unhealthy.  Not  every  one  may  be  a

Christian:  one  is  not  "converted"  to  Christianity--one  must  first  be  sick

enough for it.... We others, who have the courage for health and likewise for

contempt,--we may well despise a religion that teaches misunderstanding of

the body! that refuses to rid itself of the superstition about the soul! thatmakes a "virtue" of insufficient nourishment! that combats health as a sort of

enemy,  devil,  temptation!  that  persuades  itself  that  it  is  possible  to  carry

about a "perfect soul" in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to

devise  for  itself  a  new  concept  of  "perfection,"  a  pale,  sickly,  idiotically

ecstatic state of existence, so-called "holiness"--a holiness that is itself merely

a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and incurably disordered

body!... The Christian movement, as a European movement, was from the

start  no  more  than  a  general  uprising  of  all  sorts  of  outcast  and  refuse

elements (--who now, under cover of Christianity, aspire to power). It does

not  represent  the  decay  of  a  race;  it  represents,  on  the  contrary,  a

conglomeration of decadence products from all directions, crowding together

and seeking one another out. It was not, as has been thought, the corruption

of antiquity, of noble antiquity, which made Christianity possible; one cannot

too  sharply  challenge  the  learned  imbecility  which  today  maintains  that

theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the whole

imperium  were  Christianized,  the  contrary  type,  the  nobility,  reached  its

finest and ripest development. The majority became master; democracy, with

its Christian instincts, triumphed.... Christianity was not "national," it was not

based on race--it appealed to all the varieties of men disinherited by life, it

had its allies everywhere. Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very

core--the instinct against the healthy, against health. Everything that is well-

constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence to its ears

and  eyes.  Again  I  remind  you  of  Paul's  priceless  saying:  "And  God  hath

chosen the weak things of the world, the foolish things of the world, the base

things of the world, and things which are despised":[23] this was the formula;

in hoc signo the decadence triumphed.--God on the cross--is man always to

miss the frightful inner significance of this symbol?--Everything that suffers,

everything that hangs on the cross, is divine.... We all hang on the cross,

consequently we are divine.... We alone are divine.... Christianity was thus a

victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed by it--Christianity remains to

this day the greatest misfortune of humanity.--

  [22] The word training is in English in the text.

  [23] 1 Corinthians i, 27, 28.

  52.

    Christianity also stands in opposition to all intellectual well-being,--sick

reasoning is the only sort that it can use as Christian reasoning; it takes the

side of everything that is idiotic; it pronounces a curse upon "intellect," uponthe superbia of the healthy intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity,

it  follows  that  the  typically  Christian  state  of  "faith"  must  be  a  form  of

sickness  too,  and  that  all  straight,  straightforward  and  scientific  paths  to

knowledge must be banned by the church as forbidden ways. Doubt is thus a

sin from the start.... The complete lack of psychological cleanliness in the

priest--revealed  by  a  glance  at  him--is  a  phenomenon  resulting  from

decadence,--one may observe in hysterical women and in rachitic children

how regularly the falsification of instincts, delight in lying for the mere sake

of  lying,  and  incapacity  for  looking  straight  and  walking  straight  are

symptoms of decadence. "Faith" means the will to avoid knowing what is

true. The pietist, the priest of either sex, is a fraud because he is sick: his

instinct demands that the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point.

"Whatever makes for illness is good; whatever issues from abundance, from

superabundance, from power, is evil": so argues the believer. The impulse to

lie--it  is  by  this  that  I  recognize  every  foreordained  theologian.--Another

characteristic of the theologian is his unfitness for philology. What I here

mean by philology is, in a general sense, the art of reading with profit--the

capacity for absorbing facts without interpreting them falsely, and without

losing  caution,  patience  and  subtlety  in  the  effort  to  understand  them.

Philology  as  ephexis[24]  in  interpretation:  whether  one  be  dealing  with

books, with newspaper reports, with the most fateful events or with weather

statistics--not to mention the "salvation of the soul."... The way in which a

theologian, whether in Berlin or in Rome, is ready to explain, say, a "passage

of Scripture," or an experience, or a victory by the national army, by turning

upon it the high illumination of the Psalms of David, is always so daring that

it is enough to make a philologian run up a wall. But what shall he do when

pietists  and  other  such  cows  from  Suabia[25]  use  the  "finger  of  God"  to

convert  their  miserably  commonplace  and  huggermugger  existence  into  a

miracle of "grace," a "providence" and an "experience of salvation"? The

most modest exercise of the intellect, not to say of decency, should certainly

be  enough  to  convince  these  interpreters  of  the  perfect  childishness  and

unworthiness of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity. However small

our piety, if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the

head at just the right time, or got us into our carriage at the very instant heavy

rain  began  to  fall,  he  would  seem  so  absurd  a  god  that  he'd  have  to  be

abolished even if he existed. God as a domestic servant, as a letter carrier, as

an  almanac-man--at  bottom,  he  is  a  mere  name  for  the  stupidest  sort  ofchance....  "Divine  Providence,"  which  every  third  man  in  "educated

Germany" still believes in, is so strong an argument against God that it would

be impossible to think of a stronger. And in any case it is an argument against

Germans!...

  [24] That is, to say, scepticism. Among the Greeks scepticism was also

occasionally called ephecticism.

Biblical criticism. The leader of this school was F. C. Baur, and one of the

  --It is so little true that martyrs offer any support to the truth of a cause

that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything to do with

the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings what he fancies to be

true at the head of the world there appears so low a grade of intellectual

honesty  and  such  insensibility  to  the  problem  of  "truth,"  that  it  is  never

necessary to refute him. Truth is not something that one man has and another

man has not: at best, only peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think

of truth in any such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a

man's intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, his discretion,

on this point. To know in five cases, and to refuse, with delicacy, to know

anything  further....  "Truth,"  as  the  word  is  understood  by  every  prophet,

every sectarian, every free-thinker, every Socialist and every churchman, is

simply a complete proof that not even a beginning has been made in the

intellectual discipline and self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of

even the smallest truth.--The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing,

have been misfortunes of history: they have misled.... The conclusion that all

idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a cause

for  which  any  one  goes  to  his  death  (or  which,  as  under  primitive

Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)--this conclusion has been

an  unspeakable  drag  upon  the  testing  of  facts,  upon  the  whole  spirit  of

inquiry and investigation. The martyrs have damaged the truth.... Even to this

day the crude fact of persecution is enough to give an honourable name to the

most empty sort of sectarianism.--But why? Is the worth of a cause altered by

the fact that some one had laid down his life for it?--An error that becomes

honourable  is  simply  an  error  that  has  acquired  one  seductive  charm  the

more:  do  you  suppose,  Messrs.  Theologians,  that  we  shall  give  you  thechance  to  be  martyred  for  your  lies?--One  best  disposes  of  a  cause  by

respectfully  putting  it  on  ice--that  is  also  the  best  way  to  dispose  of

theologians....  This  was  precisely  the  world-historical  stupidity  of  all  the

persecutors:  that  they  gave  the  appearance  of  honour  to  the  cause  they

opposed--that  they  made  it  a  present  of  the  fascination  of  martyrdom....

Women are still on their knees before an error because they have been told

that some one died on the cross for it. Is the cross, then, an argument?--But

about all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been

needed for thousands of years--Zarathustra.

  They made signs in blood along the way that they went, and their folly

taught them that the truth is proved by blood.

  But blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth; blood poisoneth even

the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and hatred in the heart.

  And when one goeth through fire for his teaching--what doth that prove?

Verily, it is more when one's teaching cometh out of one's own burning![26]

  [26]  The  quotations  are  from  "Also  sprach  Zarathustra"  ii,  24:  "Of

Priests."

  54.

  Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical. Zarathustra

is a sceptic. The strength, the freedom which proceed from intellectual power,

from  a  superabundance  of  intellectual  power,  manifest  themselves  as

scepticism.  Men  of  fixed  convictions  do  not  count  when  it  comes  to

determining  what  is  fundamental  in  values  and  lack  of  values.  Men  of

convictions are prisoners. They do not see far enough, they do not see what is

below them: whereas a man who would talk to any purpose about value and

non-value must be able to see five hundred convictions beneath him--and

behind him.... A mind that aspires to great things, and that wills the means

thereto, is necessarily sceptical. Freedom from any sort of conviction belongs

to strength, and to an independent point of view.... That grand passion which

is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptic's existence, and is both

more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself, drafts the whole of

his intellect into its service; it makes him unscrupulous; it gives him courage

to employ unholy means; under certain circumstances it does not begrudge

him even convictions. Conviction as a means: one may achieve a good deal

by  means  of  a  conviction.  A  grand  passion  makes  use  of  and  uses  up

convictions; it does not yield to them--it knows itself to be sovereign.--On the

contrary, the need of faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay, ofCarlylism, if I may be allowed the word, is a need of weakness. The man of

faith, the "believer" of any sort, is necessarily a dependent man--such a man

cannot posit himself as a goal, nor can he find goals within himself. The

"believer" does not belong to himself; he can only be a means to an end; he

must be used up; he needs some one to use him up. His instinct gives the

highest honours to an ethic of self-effacement; he is prompted to embrace it

by everything: his prudence, his experience, his vanity. Every sort of faith is

in itself an evidence of self-effacement, of self-estrangement.... When one

reflects how necessary it is to the great majority that there be regulations to

restrain them from without and hold them fast, and to what extent control, or,

in a higher sense, slavery, is the one and only condition which makes for the

well-being of the weak-willed man, and especially woman, then one at once

understands conviction and "faith." To the man with convictions they are his

backbone. To avoid seeing many things, to be impartial about nothing, to be a

party man through and through, to estimate all values strictly and infallibly--

these are conditions necessary to the existence of such a man. But by the

same  token  they  are  antagonists  of  the  truthful  man--of  the  truth....  The

believer is not free to answer the question, "true" or "not true," according to

the dictates of his own conscience: integrity on this point would work his

instant downfall. The pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of

convictions into a fanatic--Savonarola, Luther, Rousseau, Robespierre, Saint-

Simon--these types stand in opposition to the strong, emancipated spirit. But

the grandiose attitudes of these sick intellects, these intellectual epileptics, are

of influence upon the great masses--fanatics are picturesque, and mankind

prefers observing poses to listening to reasons....

  55.

  --One step further in the psychology of conviction, of "faith." It is now a

good  while  since  I  first  proposed  for  consideration  the  question  whether

convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than lies. ("Human,

All-Too-Human," I, aphorism 483.)[27] This time I desire to put the question

definitely: is there any actual difference between a lie and a conviction?--All

the world believes that there is; but what is not believed by all the world!--

Every conviction has its history, its primitive forms, its stage of tentativeness

and error: it becomes a conviction only after having been, for a long time, not

one, and then, for an even longer time, hardly one. What if falsehood be also

one of these embryonic forms of conviction?--Sometimes all that is needed is

a change in persons: what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in theson.--I call it lying to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse to see it as it is:

whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not before witnesses is of no

consequence. The most common sort of lie is that by which a man deceives

himself: the deception of others is a relatively rare offence.--Now, this will

not to see what one sees, this will not to see it as it is, is almost the first

requisite  for  all  who  belong  to  a  party  of  whatever  sort:  the  party  man

becomes inevitably a liar. For example, the German historians are convinced

that Rome was synonymous with despotism and that the Germanic peoples

brought the spirit of liberty into the world: what is the difference between this

conviction and a lie? Is it to be wondered at that all partisans, including the

German historians, instinctively roll the fine phrases of morality upon their

tongues--that morality almost owes its very survival to the fact that the party

man of every sort has need of it every moment?--"This is our conviction: we

publish it to the whole world; we live and die for it--let us respect all who

have convictions!"--I have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of

anti-Semites. On the contrary, gentlemen! An anti-Semite surely does not

become more respectable because he lies on principle.... The priests, who

have more finesse in such matters, and who well understand the objection

that lies against the notion of a conviction, which is to say, of a falsehood that

becomes a matter of principle because it serves a purpose, have borrowed

from the Jews the shrewd device of sneaking in the concepts, "God," "the will

of  God"  and  "the  revelation  of  God"  at  this  place.  Kant,  too,  with  his

categorical imperative, was on the same road: this was his practical reason.

[28] There are questions regarding the truth or untruth of which it is not for

man to decide; all the capital questions, all the capital problems of valuation,

are  beyond  human  reason....  To  know  the  limits  of  reason--that  alone  is

genuine philosophy.... Why did God make a revelation to man? Would God

have done anything superfluous? Man could not find out for himself what

was good and what was evil, so God taught him His will.... Moral: the priest

does not lie--the question, "true" or "untrue," has nothing to do with such

things as the priest discusses; it is impossible to lie about these things. In

order to lie here it would be necessary to know what is true. But this is more

than man can know; therefore, the priest is simply the mouthpiece of God.--

Such a priestly syllogism is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the

right  to  lie  and  the  shrewd  dodge  of  "revelation"  belong  to  the  general

priestly type--to the priest of the decadence as well as to the priest of pagan

times (--Pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom "God" is aword signifying acquiescence in all things).--The "law," the "will of God,"

the "holy book," and "inspiration"--all these things are merely words for the

conditions  under  which  the  priest  comes  to  power  and  with  which  he

maintains his power,--these concepts are to be found at the bottom of all

priestly organizations, and of all priestly or priestly-philosophical schemes of

governments. The "holy lie"--common alike to Confucius, to the Code of

Manu, to Mohammed and to the Christian church--is not even wanting in

Plato. "Truth is here": this means, no matter where it is heard, the priest

lies....

  [27] The aphorism, which is headed "The Enemies of Truth," makes the

direct  statement:  "Convictions  are  more  dangerous  enemies  of  truth  than

lies."

  [28] A reference, of course, to Kant's "Kritik der praktischen Vernunft"

(Critique of Practical Reason).

  56.

  --In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the end of lying? The fact

that, in Christianity, "holy" ends are not visible is my objection to the means

it employs. Only bad ends appear: the poisoning, the calumniation, the denial

of life, the despising of the body, the degradation and self-contamination of

man  by  the  concept  of  sin--therefore,  its  means  are  also  bad.--I  have  a

contrary  feeling  when  I  read  the  Code  of  Manu,  an  incomparably  more

intellectual  and  superior  work,  which  it  would  be  a  sin  against  the

intelligence to so much as name in the same breath with the Bible. It is easy

to see why: there is a genuine philosophy behind it, in it, not merely an evil-

smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism and superstition,--it gives even the most

fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And, not to forget

what is most important, it differs fundamentally from every kind of Bible: by

means of it the nobles, the philosophers and the warriors keep the whip-hand

over  the  majority;  it  is  full  of  noble  valuations,  it  shows  a  feeling  of

perfection, an acceptance of life, and triumphant feeling toward self and life--

the sun shines upon the whole book.--All the things on which Christianity

vents  its  fathomless  vulgarity--for  example,  procreation,  women  and

marriage--are  here  handled  earnestly,  with  reverence  and  with  love  and

confidence. How can any one really put into the hands of children and ladies

a book which contains such vile things as this: "to avoid fornication, let every

man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; ... it is

better to marry than to burn"?[29] And is it possible to be a Christian so longas  the  origin  of  man  is  Christianized,  which  is  to  say,  befouled,  by  the

doctrine of the immaculata conceptio?... I know of no book in which so many

delicate and kindly things are said of women as in the Code of Manu; these

old  grey-beards  and  saints  have  a  way  of  being  gallant  to  women  that  it

would be impossible, perhaps, to surpass. "The mouth of a woman," it says in

one place, "the breasts of a maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of

sacrifice are always pure." In another place: "there is nothing purer than the

light of the sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a

maiden." Finally, in still another place--perhaps this is also a holy lie--: "all

the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all below are impure.

Only in the maiden is the whole body pure."

  [29] 1 Corinthians vii, 2, 9.

  57.

  One catches the unholiness of Christian means in flagranti by the simple

process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the ends sought by

the Code of Manu--by putting these enormously antithetical ends under a

strong light. The critic of Christianity cannot evade the necessity of making

Christianity contemptible.--A book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the

same origin as every other good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the

sagacity and the ethical experimentation of long centuries; it brings things to

a conclusion; it no longer creates. The prerequisite to a codification of this

sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the authority of a

slowly and painfully attained truth are fundamentally different from those

which  one  would  make  use  of  to  prove  it.  A  law-book  never  recites  the

utility, the grounds, the casuistical antecedents of a law: for if it did so it

would  lose  the  imperative  tone,  the  "thou  shall,"  on  which  obedience  is

based. The problem lies exactly here.--At a certain point in the evolution of a

people, the class within it of the greatest insight, which is to say, the greatest

hindsight and foresight, declares that the series of experiences determining

how all shall live--or can live--has come to an end. The object now is to reap

as rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment and

hard  experience.  In  consequence,  the  thing  that  is  to  be  avoided  above

everything is further experimentation--the continuation of the state in which

values are fluent, and are tested, chosen and criticized ad infinitum. Against

this  a  double  wall  is  set  up:  on  the  one  hand,  revelation,  which  is  the

assumption that the reasons lying behind the laws are not of human origin,

that they were not sought out and found by a slow process and after manyerrors, but that they are of divine ancestry, and came into being complete,

perfect, without a history, as a free gift, a miracle...; and on the other hand,

tradition, which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged from

time immemorial, and that it is impious and a crime against one's forefathers

to bring it into question. The authority of the law is thus grounded on the

thesis:  God  gave  it,  and  the  fathers  lived  it.--The  higher  motive  of  such

procedure lies in the design to distract consciousness, step by step, from its

concern  with  notions  of  right  living  (that  is  to  say,  those  that  have  been

proved  to  be  right  by  wide  and  carefully  considered  experience),  so  that

instinct attains to a perfect automatism--a primary necessity to every sort of

mastery, to every sort of perfection in the art of life. To draw up such a law-

book  as  Manu's  means  to  lay  before  a  people  the  possibility  of  future

mastery,  of  attainable  perfection--it  permits  them  to  aspire  to  the  highest

reaches of the art of life. To that end the thing must be made unconscious:

that  is  the  aim  of  every  holy  lie.--The  order  of  castes,  the  highest,  the

dominating law, is merely the ratification of an order of nature, of a natural

law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary fiat, no "modern idea," can exert

any influence. In every healthy society there are three physiological types,

gravitating toward differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and

each of these has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special

mastery and feeling of perfection. It is not Manu but nature that sets off in

one class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are marked

by  muscular  strength  and  temperament,  and  in  a  third  those  who  are

distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only mediocrity--the

last-named represents the great majority, and the first two the select. The

superior caste--I call it the fewest--has, as the most perfect, the privileges of

the few: it stands for happiness, for beauty, for everything good upon earth.

Only the most intellectual of men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful;

only in them can goodness escape being weakness. Pulchrum est paucorum

hominum:[30] goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to

them  than  uncouth  manners  or  a  pessimistic  look,  or  an  eye  that  sees

ugliness--or indignation against the general aspect of things. Indignation is

the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. "The world is perfect"--so

prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the instinct of the man who says yes to

life. "Imperfection, whatever is inferior to us, distance, the pathos of distance,

even  the  Chandala  themselves  are  parts  of  this  perfection."  The  most

intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others wouldfind only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with

others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes

second  nature,  a  necessity,  an  instinct.  They  regard  a  difficult  task  as  a

privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all

others.... Knowledge--a form of asceticism.--They are the most honourable

kind of men: but that does not prevent them being the most cheerful and most

amiable. They rule, not because they want to, but because they are; they are

not at liberty to play second.--The second caste: to this belong the guardians

of the law, the keepers of order and security, the more noble warriors, above

all, the king as the highest form of warrior, judge and preserver of the law.

The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals, the next

to them in rank, taking from them all that is rough in the business of ruling--

their followers, their right hand, their most apt disciples.--In all this, I repeat,

there is nothing arbitrary, nothing "made up"; whatever is to the contrary is

made up--by it nature is brought to shame.... The order of castes, the order of

rank, simply formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the

three types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution of

higher types, and the highest types--the inequality of rights is essential to the

existence of any rights at all.--A right is a privilege. Every one enjoys the

privileges that accord with his state of existence. Let us not underestimate the

privileges of the mediocre. Life is always harder as one mounts the heights--

the cold increases, responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid:

it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and

soundly  consolidated  mediocrity.  The  handicrafts,  commerce,  agriculture,

science,  the  greater  part  of  art,  in  brief,  the  whole  range  of  occupational

activities,  are  compatible  only  with  mediocre  ability  and  aspiration;  such

callings  would  be  out  of  place  for  exceptional  men;  the  instincts  which

belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as to anarchism. The

fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a wheel, a function, is evidence of

a natural predisposition; it is not society, but the only sort of happiness that

the majority are capable of, that makes them intelligent machines. To the

mediocre mediocrity is a form of happiness; they have a natural instinct for

mastering one thing, for specialization. It would be altogether unworthy of a

profound intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself. It is,

in  fact,  the  first  prerequisite  to  the  appearance  of  the  exceptional:  it  is  a

necessary condition to a high degree of civilization. When the exceptional

man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than he applies tohimself or to his equals, this is not merely kindness of heart--it is simply his

duty.... Whom do I hate most heartily among the rabbles of today? The rabble

of Socialists, the apostles to the Chandala, who undermine the workingman's

instincts, his pleasure, his feeling of contentment with his petty existence--

who make him envious and teach him revenge.... Wrong never lies in unequal

rights; it lies in the assertion of "equal" rights.... What is bad? But I have

already  answered:  all  that  proceeds  from  weakness,  from  envy,  from

revenge.--The anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry....

  [30] Few men are noble.

  58.

  In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference:

whether  one  preserves  thereby  or  destroys.  There  is  a  perfect  likeness

between  Christian  and  anarchist:  their  object,  their  instinct,  points  only

toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of this: there it

appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied a code of religious

legislation whose object it was to convert the conditions which cause life to

flourish into an "eternal" social organization,--Christianity found its mission

in putting an end to such an organization, because life flourished under it.

There the benefits that reason had produced during long ages of experiment

and insecurity were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made

to  bring  in  a  harvest  that  should  be  as  large,  as  rich  and  as  complete  as

possible;  here,  on  the  contrary,  the  harvest  is  blighted  overnight....  That

which  stood  there  aere  perennis,  the  imperium  Romanum,  the  most

magnificent form of organization under difficult conditions that has ever been

achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after it appears as

patchwork, bungling, dilletantism--those holy anarchists made it a matter of

"piety" to destroy "the world," which is to say, the imperium Romanum, so

that in the end not a stone stood upon another--and even Germans and other

such louts were able to become its masters.... The Christian and the anarchist:

both are decadents; both are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating,

poisonous,  degenerating,  blood-sucking;  both  have  an  instinct  of  mortal

hatred  of  everything  that  stands  up,  and  is  great,  and  has  durability,  and

promises  life  a  future....  Christianity  was  the  vampire  of  the  imperium

Romanum,--overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans: the

conquest of the soil for a great culture that could await its time. Can it be that

this fact is not yet understood? The imperium Romanum that we know, and

that the history of the Roman provinces teaches us to know better and better,--this most admirable of all works of art in the grand manner was merely the

beginning,  and  the  structure  to  follow  was  not  to  prove  its  worth  for

thousands of years. To this day, nothing on a like scale sub specie aeterni has

been brought into being, or even dreamed of!--This organization was strong

enough to withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to

do with such things--the first principle of all genuinely great architecture. But

it was not strong enough to stand up against the corruptest of all forms of

corruption--against  Christians....  These  stealthy  worms,  which  under  the

cover of night, mist and duplicity, crept upon every individual, sucking him

dry  of  all  earnest  interest  in  real  things,  of  all  instinct  for  reality--this

cowardly, effeminate and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all "souls,"

step by step, from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious,

manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own

cause,  their  own  serious  purpose,  their  own  pride.  The  sneakishness  of

hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell, such as

the sacrifice of the innocent, the unio mystica in the drinking of blood, above

all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of Chandala revenge--all that sort of

thing became master of Rome: the same kind of religion which, in a pre-

existent  form,  Epicurus  had  combatted.  One  has  but  to  read  Lucretius  to

know what Epicurus made war upon--not paganism, but "Christianity," which

is  to  say,  the  corruption  of  souls  by  means  of  the  concepts  of  guilt,

punishment  and  immortality.--He  combatted  the  subterranean  cults,  the

whole  of  latent  Christianity--to  deny  immortality  was  already  a  form  of

genuine salvation.--Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in

Rome was Epicurean--when Paul appeared ... Paul, the Chandala hatred of

Rome, of "the world," in the flesh and inspired by genius--the Jew, the eternal

Jew  par  excellence....  What  he  saw  was  how,  with  the  aid  of  the  small

sectarian  Christian  movement  that  stood  apart  from  Judaism,  a  "world

conflagration" might be kindled; how, with the symbol of "God on the cross,"

all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic intrigues in the empire, might

be  amalgamated  into  one  immense  power.  "Salvation  is  of  the  Jews."--

Christianity is the formula for exceeding and summing up the subterranean

cults of all varieties, that of Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras,

for instance: in his discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself.

His instinct was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he put

the ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the

mouth of the "Saviour" as his own inventions, and not only into the mouth--he  made  out  of  him  something  that  even  a  priest  of  Mithras  could

understand.... This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the fact that

he needed the belief in immortality in order to rob "the world" of its value,

that the concept of "hell" would master Rome--that the notion of a "beyond"

is the death of life.... Nihilist and Christian: they rhyme in German, and they

do more than rhyme....

  59.

  The whole labour of the ancient world gone for naught: I have no word to

describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.--And, considering

the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with adamantine self-

consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to go on for thousands

of  years,  the  whole  meaning  of  antiquity  disappears!...  To  what  end  the

Greeks? to what end the Romans?--All the prerequisites to a learned culture,

all the methods of science, were already there; man had already perfected the

great and incomparable art of reading profitably--that first necessity to the

tradition of culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance

with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,--the sense of fact,

the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools, and its traditions

were already centuries old! Is all this properly understood? Every essential to

the beginning of the work was ready:--and the most essential, it cannot be

said too often, are methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the

longest opposed by habit and laziness. What we have today reconquered,

with  unspeakable  self-discipline,  for  ourselves--for  certain  bad  instincts,

certain Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies--that is to say, the keen eye

for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the smallest things,

the whole integrity of knowledge--all these things were already there, and had

been  there  for  two  thousand  years!  More,  there  was  also  a  refined  and

excellent tact and taste! Not as mere brain-drilling! Not as "German" culture,

with its loutish manners! But as body, as bearing, as instinct--in short, as

reality.... All gone for naught! Overnight it became merely a memory!--The

Greeks! The Romans! Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius

for organization and administration, faith in and the will to secure the future

of man, a great yes to everything entering into the imperium Romanum and

palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but had

become  reality,  truth,  life....--All  overwhelmed  in  a  night,  but  not  by  a

convulsion of nature! Not trampled to death by Teutons and others of heavy

hoof! But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking, invisible, an�mic vampires!Not  conquered,--only  sucked  dry!...  Hidden  vengefulness,  petty  envy,

became master! Everything wretched, intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad

feelings, the whole ghetto-world of the soul, was at once on top!--One needs

but read any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to

realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It would be an

error, however, to assume that there was any lack of understanding in the

leaders of the Christian movement:--ah, but they were clever, clever to the

point  of  holiness,  these  fathers  of  the  church!  What  they  lacked  was

something  quite  different.  Nature  neglected--perhaps  forgot--to  give  them

even  the  most  modest  endowment  of  respectable,  of  upright,  of  cleanly

instincts.... Between ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises

Christianity, it has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it

is dealing with men....

  60.

    Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization, and

later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of Mohammedan civilization.

The  wonderful  culture  of  the  Moors  in  Spain,  which  was  fundamentally

nearer to us and appealed more to our senses and tastes than that of Rome and

Greece, was trampled down (--I do not say by what sort of feet--) Why?

Because it had to thank noble and manly instincts for its origin--because it

said yes to life, even to the rare and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!...

The crusaders later made war on something before which it would have been

more  fitting  for  them  to  have  grovelled  in  the  dust--a  civilization  beside

which even that of our nineteenth century seems very poor and very "senile."-

-What they wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich.... Let us put

aside our prejudices! The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing

more! The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in

its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility

was to be won.... The German noble, always the "Swiss guard" of the church,

always in the service of every bad instinct of the church--but well paid....

Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German swords and German

blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry through its war to the

death  upon  everything  noble  on  earth!  At  this  point  a  host  of  painful

questions suggest themselves. The German nobility stands outside the history

of the higher civilization: the reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol--the

two great means of corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice

between Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. Thedecision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here. Either

a man is a Chandala or he is not.... "War to the knife with Rome! Peace and

friendship with Islam!": this was the feeling, this was the act, of that great

free spirit, that genius among German emperors, Frederick II. What! must a

German first be a genius, a free spirit, before he can feel decently? I can't

make out how a German could ever feel Christian....

  61.

  Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred

times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the

last  great  harvest  of  civilization  that  Europe  was  ever  to  reap--the

Renaissance. Is it understood at last, will it ever be understood, what the

Renaissance was? The transvaluation of Christian values,--an attempt with all

available means, all instincts and all the resources of genius to bring about a

triumph of the opposite values, the more noble values.... This has been the

one great war of the past; there has never been a more critical question than

that of the Renaissance--it is my question too--; there has never been a form

of attack more fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a

whole front upon the center of the enemy! To attack at the critical place, at

the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more noble values--that is

to say, to insinuate them into the instincts, into the most fundamental needs

and appetites of those sitting there ... I see before me the possibility of a

perfectly heavenly enchantment and spectacle:--it seems to me to scintillate

with all the vibrations of a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an

art so divine, so infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands

of years for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance

and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should arouse all

the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter--C�sar Borgia as pope!... Am I

understood?... Well then, that would have been the sort of triumph that I

alone  am  longing  for  today--:  by  it  Christianity  would  have  been  swept

away!--What  happened?  A  German  monk,  Luther,  came  to  Rome.  This

monk, with all the vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a

rebellion  against  the  Renaissance  in  Rome....  Instead  of  grasping,  with

profound  thanksgiving,  the  miracle  that  had  taken  place:  the  conquest  of

Christianity at its capital--instead of this, his hatred was stimulated by the

spectacle.  A  religious  man  thinks  only  of  himself.--Luther  saw  only  the

depravity of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming

apparent: the old corruption, the peccatum originale, Christianity itself, nolonger occupied the papal chair! Instead there was life! Instead there was the

triumph of life! Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring

things!... And Luther restored the church: he attacked it.... The Renaissance--

an event without meaning, a great futility!--Ah, these Germans, what they

have not cost us! Futility--that has always been the work of the Germans.--

The Reformation; Leibnitz; Kant and so-called German philosophy; the war

of "liberation"; the empire--every time a futile substitute for something that

once existed, for something irrecoverable.... These Germans, I confess, are

my enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation, their

cowardice before every honest yea and nay. For nearly a thousand years they

have tangled and confused everything their fingers have touched; they have

on  their  conscience  all  the  half-way  measures,  all  the  three-eighths-way

measures,  that  Europe  is  sick  of,--they  also  have  on  their  conscience  the

uncleanest  variety  of  Christianity  that  exists,  and  the  most  incurable  and

indestructible--Protestantism....  If  mankind  never  manages  to  get  rid  of

Christianity the Germans will be to blame....

  62.

  --With  this  I  come  to  a  conclusion  and  pronounce  my  judgment.  I

condemn Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most terrible of

all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his mouth. It is, to me, the

greatest  of  all  imaginable  corruptions;  it  seeks  to  work  the  ultimate

corruption,  the  worst  possible  corruption.  The  Christian  church  has  left

nothing  untouched  by  its  depravity;  it  has  turned  every  value  into

worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of

soul. Let any one dare to speak to me of its "humanitarian" blessings! Its

deepest necessities range it against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by

distress; it creates distress to make itself immortal.... For example, the worm

of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this misery!--The

"equality of souls before God"--this fraud, this pretext for the rancunes of all

the base-minded--this explosive concept, ending in revolution, the modern

idea, and the notion of overthrowing the whole social order--this is Christian

dynamite.... The "humanitarian" blessings of Christianity forsooth! To breed

out of humanitas a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to lie at

any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest instincts! All

this, to me, is the "humanitarianism" of Christianity!--Parasitism as the only

practice of the church; with its an�mic and "holy" ideals, sucking all the

blood, all the love, all the hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny allreality;  the  cross  as  the  distinguishing  mark  of  the  most  subterranean

conspiracy  ever  heard  of,--against  health,  beauty,  well-being,  intellect,

kindness of soul--against life itself....

  This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls,

wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the blind will be able

to  see....  I  call  Christianity  the  one  great  curse,  the  one  great  intrinsic

depravity,  the  one  great  instinct  of  revenge,  for  which  no  means  are

venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and small enough,--I call it the one

immortal blemish upon the human race....

  And  mankind  reckons  time  from  the  dies  nefastus  when  this  fatality

befell--from  the  first  day  of  Christianity!--Why  not  rather  from  its  last?--

From today?--The transvaluation of all values!...

  THE END



                                      ECCE HOMO

                              Translated by A.M. Ludovici

                                        PREFACE

  As it is my intention within a very short time to confront my fellow-men

with the very greatest demand that has ever yet been made upon them, it

seems to me above all necessary to declare here who and what I am. As a

matter of fact, this ought to be pretty well known already, for I have not "held

my tongue" about myself. But the difference between the greatness of my

task and the smallness of my contemporaries, is revealed by the fact that

people have neither heard me nor yet seen me. I live on my own self-made

credit, and it is probably only a prejudice that I live at all. I only have to

speak with one of the "educated" who come here in the summer to the Swiss

Upper Engadine to convince myself that I am not alive. . . . Under these

circumstances,  it  is  my  duty  -  against  which  my  usual  reserve  and,  even

more, the pride of my instincts rebel - to say : Listen ! for I am such and such

a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else !

  I am, for example, in no way a bogey man, or moral monster. I am really

the very opposite of the kind of man that has been honoured until now as

virtuous. Between ourselves, it seems to me that precisely this is part of my

pride. I am a disciple of the philosopher Dionysus, and I would prefer to be

even  a  satyr  than  a  saint.  But  just  read  this  little  book  !  Maybe  I  have

succeeded, perhaps this work had no other meaning than to give expression tothis contrast in a cheerful and philanthropic manner. The very last thing I

should promise would be to " improve " mankind. I'm not setting up any new

idols; let the old idols learn what it means to have feet of clay. To overthrow

idols (my name for "ideals") is much closer to my craft. Reality has been

robbed of its value, its meaning, and its truthfulness, to precisely the extent to

which one has falsely invented an ideal world . . . . The " true world " and the

" apparent world " - in plain English, the falsely invented world and reality. . .

.  The  lie  of  the  ideal  has  always  been  the  curse  on  reality;  through  it

mankind's most fundamental instincts have become lying and false; to the

point of worshipping those values opposite to those which would ensure its

thriving, its future, the lofty right to its future.

  He who knows how to breathe the air of my writings is conscious that it is

the air of the heights, a strong air. A man must be built for it, otherwise there

is danger he will become sick with a cold. Ice is near, the loneliness is terrible

-  but  how  serenely  everything  lies  in  the  sunshine!  how  freely  one  can

breathe! one feels how much lies beneath oneself! Philosophy, as I have so

far  understood  and  lived  it,  is  living  voluntarily  among  ice  and  high

mountains - seeking out everything strange and questionable in existence,

everything so far prohibited by morality. Long experience, derived from such

wanderings  in  the  forbidden,  taught  me  to  regard  the  causes  that  have

prompted moralizing and idealizing in a very different light from what may

seem desirable: The hidden history of the philosophers, the psychology of the

great names, was revealed to me. How much truth can a spirit endure ; how

much truth does it dare ? - for me more and more these questions became the

real test of value. Error (the faith in the ideal) is not blindness ; error is

cowardice. . . . Every achievement, every step forward in knowledge, arises

from courage, from hardness towards one's self, from cleanliness towards

one's self. I do not refute ideals; I merely put on gloves in their presence. . . .

Nitimur in vetitum ["We strive for the forbidden": Ovid, Amores, III, 4, 17];

with this indication my philosophy will one day triumph; for that which has

so far been fundamentally forbidden is, without exception, truth.

  To me among my writings my Zarathustra stands apart. With it, I gave

humanity  the  greatest  gift  that  has  ever  been  bestowed  on  it.  This  book,

whose voice bridges thousands of years, is not only the highest book there is,

truly the book of high mountain air,- the whole phenomenon, mankind, lies at

an tremendous distance beneath it - but it is also the deepest book, born of the

innermost abundance of truth; an inexhaustible well, into which no pail goesdown  without  coming  up  again  filled  with  gold  and  goodness.  Here  no

"prophet" speaks, none of those gruesome hybrids of sickness and will to

power, whom men call founders of religions. If one is not to do a grave

injustice to its wisdom, he must above all hear the tone - a halcyon tone- that

comes from the mouth of Zarathustra : " The most silent words are harbingers

of the storm ; thoughts that come on dove's feet lead the world. " The figs fall

from the trees ; they are good and sweet, and, when they fall, their red skins

are  rent.  "  A  north  wind  am  I  unto  ripe  figs.  "  Thus,  like  figs,  do  these

precepts drop down to you, my friends; now drink their juice and their sweet

pulp. " It is autumn all around, and clear sky, and afternoon." No fanatic

speaks to you here; this is not a " sermon"; no faith is demanded in these

pages. From out an infinite treasure of light and well of joy, drop by drop, my

words fall out-a slow and gentle gait is the cadence of these discourses. Such

things can reach only the most elect ; it is a rare privilege to be a listener

here;  not  everyone  who  likes  can  have  ears  to  hear  Zarathustra.  Is  not

Zarathustra, because of these things, a seducer! . . . But what, indeed, does he

himself say, when for the first time he goes back to his solitude? Just the

reverse of that which any " Sage," " Saint," " Saviour of the world," and other

decadent would say. . . . Not only his words, but he himself is other than they.

" Alone do I now go, my disciples ! Get you also hence, and alone! Thus

would I have it. " Verily, I beseech you: take your leave of me and arm

yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still, be ashamed of him ! Maybe

he hath deceived you. " The knight of knowledge must be able not only to

love his enemies, but also to hate his friends. " The man who remains a pupil

requites his teacher but ill. And why would you not pluck at my wreath ? You

honour me; but what if your reverence should one day break down ? Take

heed, lest a statue crush you. " You say you believe in Zarathustra ? But of

what account is Zarathustra ? You are my believers : but of what account are

all believers ? " You had not yet sought yourselves when you found me. Thus

do all believers; therefore is all believing worth so little. " Now I bid you lose

me and find yourselves ; and only when you have all denied me will I come

back unto you. Friedrich Nietzsche On this perfect day, when everything is

ripening, and not only the grapes are getting brown, a ray of sunshine has

fallen on my life: I looked behind me, I looked before me, and never have I

seen so many good things all at once. Not in vain have I buried my four-and-

fortieth year to-day; I had the right to bury it-that in it which still had life, has

been  saved  and  is  immortal.  The  first  book  of  the  Transvaluation  of  allValues, The Songs of Zarathustra, The Twilight of the Idols, my attempt to

philosophise with the hammer-all these things are the gift of this year, and

even of its last quarter. How could I help being thankful to the whole of my

life? That is why I am now going to tell myself the story of my life.

                            PART 1 WHY I AM SO WISE

  s1

  The happiness of my existence, its unique character perhaps, consists in

its fatefulness: to speak in a riddle, as my own father I am already dead, as

my own mother I still live and grow old. This double origin, taken as it were

from the highest and lowest rungs of the ladder of life, at once a decadent and

a  beginning,  this,  if  anything,  explains  that  neutrality,  that  freedom  from

partisanship in regard to the general problem of existence, which perhaps

distinguishes me. To the first indications of ascending or of descending life

my nostrils are more sensitive than those of any man that has yet lived. In this

domain I am a master to my backbone-I know both sides, for I am both sides.

My father died in his six-and-thirtieth year: he was delicate, lovable, and

morbid, like one who is preordained to pay simply a flying visit- a gracious

reminder of life rather than life itself. In the same year that his life declined

mine also declined: in my six-and-thirtieth year I reached the lowest point in

my vitality,-I still lived, but my eyes could distinguish nothing that lay three

paces  away  from  me.  At  that  time-it  was  the  year  1879-I  resigned  my

professorship at Bale, lived through the summer like a shadow in St. Moritz,

and spent the following winter, the most sunless of my life, like a shadow in

Naumburg.  This  was  my  lowest  ebb.  During  this  period  I  wrote  The

Wanderer and His Shadow. Without a doubt I was conversant with shadows

then. The winter that followed, my first winter in Genoa, brought forth that

sweetness and spirituality which is almost inseparable from extreme poverty

of blood and muscle, in the shape of The Dawn of Day. The perfect lucidity

and cheerfulness, the intellectual exuberance even, that this work reflects,

coincides,  in  my  case,  not  only  with  the  most  profound  physiological

weakness, but also with an excess of suffering. In the midst of the agony of a

headache  which  lasted  three  days,  accompanied  by  violent  nausea,  I  was

possessed of most singular dialectical clearness, and in absolutely cold blood

I then thought out things, for which, in my more healthy moments, I am not

enough of a climber, not sufficiently subtle, not sufficiently cold. My readers

perhaps know to what extent I consider dialectic a symptom of decadence, as,

for instance, in the most famous of all cases-the case of Socrates. All themorbid  disturbances  of  the  intellect,  even  that  semi-stupor  which

accompanies fever, have, unto this day, remained completely unknown to me;

and for my first information concerning their nature and frequency, I was

obliged to have recourse to the learned works which have been compiled on

the subject. My circulation is slow. No one has ever been able to detect fever

in me. A doctor who treated me for some time as a nerve patient finally

declared : " No ! there is nothing wrong with your nerves, it is simply I who

am  nervous."  It  has  been  absolutely  impossible  to  ascertain  any  local

degeneration in me, nor any organic stomach trouble, however much I may

have suffered from profound weakness of the gastric system as the result of

general exhaustion. Even my eye trouble, which sometimes approached so

parlously  near  to  blindness,  was  only  an  effect  and  not  a  cause  ;  for,

whenever  my  general  vital  condition  improved,  my  power  of  vision  also

increased. Having admitted all this, do I need to say that I am experienced in

questions of decadence ? I know them inside and out. Even that filigree art of

prehension and comprehension in general, that feeling for delicate shades of

difference, that psychology of " seeing through brick walls," and whatever

else I may be able to do, was first learnt then, and is the specific gift of that

period  during  which  everything  in  me  was  subtilised,-observation  itself,

together with all the organs of observation. To look upon healthier concepts

and values from the standpoint of the sick, and conversely to look down upon

the secret work of the instincts of decadence from the standpoint of him who

is laden and self-reliant with the richness of life-this has been my longest

exercise, my principal experience. If in anything at all, it was in this that I

became a master. To-day my hand knows the trick, I now have the knack of

reversing perspectives: the first reason perhaps why a Transvaluation of all

Values has been possible to me alone.

  s2

  For, apart from the fact that I am a decadent, I am also the reverse of such

a creature. Among other things my proof of this is, that I always instinctively

select the proper remedy when my spiritual or bodily health is low; whereas

the decadent, as such, invariably chooses those remedies which are bad for

him. As a whole I was sound, but in certain details I was a decadent. That

energy with which I sentenced myself to absolute solitude, and to a severance

from  all  those  conditions  in  life  to  which  I  had  grown  accustomed  ;  my

discipline of myself, and my refusal to allow myself to be pampered, to be

tended  hand  and  foot,  and  to  be  doctored-all  this  betrays  the  absolutecertainty of my instincts respecting what at that time was most needful to me.

I  placed  myself  in  my  own  hands,  I  restored  myself  to  health:  the  first

condition of success in such an undertaking, as every physiologist will admit,

is  that  at  bottom  a  man  should  be  sound.  An  intrinsically  morbid  nature

cannot become healthy. On the other hand, to an intrinsically sound nature,

illness may even constitute a powerful stimulus to life, to a surplus of life. It

is in this light that I now regard the long period of illness that I endured: it

seemed as if I had discovered life afresh, my own self included. I tasted all

good things and even trifles in a way in which it was not easy for others to

taste them- out of my Will to Health and to Life I made my philosophy. . . .

For this should be thoroughly understood; it was during those years in which

my vitality reached its lowest point that I ceased from being a pessimist: the

instinct of self-recovery forbade my holding to a philosophy of poverty and

desperation. Now, by what signs are Nature's lucky strokes recognised among

men ? They are recognised by the fact that any such lucky stroke gladdens

our senses; that he is carved from one integral block, which is hard, sweet,

and fragrant as well. He enjoys that only which is good for him ; his pleasure,

his  desire,  ceases  when  the  limits  of  that  which  is  good  for  him  are

overstepped. He divines remedies for injuries; he knows how to turn serious

accidents to his own advantage ; that which does not kill him makes him

stronger. He instinctively gathers his material from all he sees, hears, and

experiences. He is a selective principle ; he rejects much. He is always in his

own  company,  whether  his  intercourse  be  with  books,  with  men,  or  with

natural  scenery;  he  honours  the  things  he  chooses,  the  things  he

acknowledges, the things he trusts. He reacts slowly to all kinds of stimuli,

with that tardiness which long caution and deliberate pride have bred in him-

he tests the approaching stimulus; he would not dream of meeting it half-way.

He believes neither in " ill-luck" nor "guilt"; he can digest himself and others;

he knows how to forget-he is strong enough to make everything turn to his

own advantage. Lo then ! I am the very reverse of a decadent, for he whom I

have just described is none other than myself.

  s3

  This double thread of experiences, this means of access to two worlds that

seem so far asunder, finds in every detail its counterpart in my own nature-I

am my own complement: I have a " second " sight, as well as a first. And

perhaps I also have a third sight. By the very nature of my origin I was

allowed  an  outlook  beyond  all  merely  local,  merely  national  and  limitedhorizons ; it required no effort on my part to he a " good European." On the

other hand, I am perhaps more German than modern Germans-mere Imperial

Germans-can hope to be,-I, the last anti-political German. Be this as it may,

my ancestors were Polish noblemen: it is owing to them that I have so much

race instinct in my blood-who knows ? perhaps even the liberum veto [The

veto power of Polish noblemen] When I think of the number of times in my

travels that I have been accosted as a Pole, even by Poles themselves, and

how seldom I have been taken for a German, it seems to me as if I belonged

to those only who have a sprinkling of German in them. But my mother,

Franziska  Oehler,  is  at  any  rate  something  very  German;  as  is  also  my

paternal grandmother, Erdmuthe Krause. The latter spent the whole of her

youth in good old Weimar, not without coming into contact with Goethe's

circle. Her brother, Krause, the Professor of Theology in Konigsberg, was

called to the post of General Superintendent at Weimar after Herder's death.

It is not unlikely that her mother, my great grandmother, is mentioned in

young Goethe's diary under the name of " Muthgen." She married twice, and

her second husband was Superintendent Nietzsche of Eilenburg. In 1813, the

year of the great war, when Napoleon with his general staff entered Eilenburg

on the 10th of October, she gave birth to a son. As a daughter of Saxony she

was a great admirer of Napoleon, and maybe I am so still. My father, born in

1813, died in 1849. Previous to taking over the pastorship of the parish of

Rocken,  not  far  from  Liitzen,  he  lived  for  some  years  at  the  Castle  of

Altenburg, where he had charge of the education of the four princesses. His

pupils are the Queen of Hanover, the Grand-Duchess Constantine, the Grand-

Duchess of Oldenburg, and the Princess Theresa of Saxe-Altenburg. He was

full of loyal respect for the Prussian King, Frederick William the Fourth,

from whom he obtained his living at Rocken; the events of 1848

    saddened  him  extremely.  As  I  was  born  on  the  15th  of  October,  the

birthday of the king above mentioned, I naturally received the Hohenzollern

names of Frederick William. There was at all events one advantage in the

choice of this day : my birthday throughout the whole of my childhood was a

day of public rejoicing. I regard it as a great privilege to have had such a

father : it even seems to me that this embraces all that I can claim in the

matter of privileges-life, the great yea to life, excepted. What I owe to him

above all is this, that I do not need any special intention, but merely a little

patience, in order involuntarily to enter a world of higher and more delicate

things. There I am at home, there alone does my inmost passion become free.The fact that I had to pay for this privilege almost with my life, certainly does

not  make  it  a  bad  bargain.  In  order  to  understand  even  a  little  of  my

Zarathustra, perhaps a man must be situated and constituted very much as I

am myself-with one foot beyond the realm of the living.

  s4

  I have never understood the art of arousing ill-feeling against myself,-this

is also something for which I have to thank my incomparable father,- even

when it seemed to me highly desirable to do so. However un-Christian it may

seem, I do not even bear any ill-feeling towards myself. Turn my life about as

you may, you will find but seldom- perhaps indeed only once-any trace of

some one's having shown me ill-will. You might perhaps discover, however,

too many traces of good-will. . . . My experiences even with those on whom

every  other  man  has  burnt  his  fingers,  speak  without  exception  in  their

favour; I tame every bear, I can make even clowns behave decently. During

the seven years in which I taught Greek to the sixth form of the College at

Bale, I never had occasion to administer a punishment; the laziest youths

were diligent in my class. The unexpected has always found me equal to it; I

must  be  unprepared  in  order  to  keep  my  self-command.  Whatever  the

instrument was, even if it were as out of tune as the instrument " man " can

possibly be,-it was only when I was ill that I could not succeed in making it

express something that was worth hearing. And how often have I not been

told by the " instruments " themselves, that they had never before heard their

voices  express  such  beautiful  things.  .  .  .  This  was  said  to  me  most

delightfully perhaps by that young fellow Heinrich von Stein, who died at

such an unpardonably early age, and who, after having considerately asked

leave to do so, once appeared in Sils-Maria for a three days' sojourn, telling

everybody there that it was not for the Engadine that he had come. This

excellent person, who with all the impetuous simplicity of a young Prussian

nobleman, had waded deep into the swamp of Wagnerism (and into that of

Duhringism * into the bargain !), seemed almost transformed during these

three days by a hurricane of freedom, like one who has been suddenly raised

to his full height and given wings. Again and again I said to him that this was

all owing to the splendid air; everybody felt the same, -one could not stand

6000

  feet above Bayreuth for nothing,-but he would not believe me. . . . Be this

as it may, if I have been the victim of many a small or even great offence, it

was not " will," and least of all ill-will that actuated the offenders ; but rather,as I have already suggested, it was goodwill, the cause of no small amount of

mischief in my life, about which I had to complain. My experience gave me a

right  to  feel  suspicious  in  regard  to  all  so-called  "unselfish"  instincts,  in

regard to the whole of "neighbourly love" which is ever ready and waiting

with deeds or with advice. To me it seems that these instincts are a sign of

weakness, they are an example of the inability to withstand a stimulus-it is

only among decadents that this pity is called a virtue. What I reproach the

pitiful with is, that they are too ready to forget shame, reverence, and the

delicacy of feeling which knows how to keep at a distance ; they do not

remember that this gushing pity stinks of the mob, and that it is next of kin to

bad manners-that pitiful hands may be thrust with results fatally destructive

into  a  great  destiny,  into  a  lonely  and  wounded  retirement,  and  into  the

privileges  with  which  great  guilt  endows  one.  The  overcoming  of  pity  I

reckon among the noble virtues. In the " Temptation of Zarathustra " I have

imagined a case, in which a great cry of distress reaches his ears, in which

pity swoops down upon him like a last sin, and would make him break faith

with himself. To remain one's own master in such circumstances, to keep the

sublimity of one's mission pure in such cases,.-pure from the many ignoble

and more short-sighted impulses which come into play in so-called unselfish

actions,-this  is  the  rub,  the  last  test  perhaps  which  a  Zarathustra  has  to

undergo-the actual proof of his power.

  s5

  In yet another respect I am no more than my father over again, and as it

were the continuation of his life after an all-too-early death. Like every man

who has never been able to meet his equal, and unto whom the concept "

retaliation " is just as incomprehensible as the notion of " equal rights," I have

forbidden myself the use of any sort of measure of security or protection-and

also, of course, of defence and "justification"-in all cases in which I have

been made the victim either of trifling or even very great foolishness. My

form of retaliation consists in this : as soon as possible to set a piece of

cleverness at the heels of an act of stupidity; by this means perhaps it may

still be possible to overtake it. To speak in a parable : I dispatch a pot of jam

in order to get rid of a bitter experience. . . . Let anybody only give me

offence, I shall " retaliate," he can be quite sure of that: before long I discover

an opportunity of expressing my thanks to the " offender " (among other

things even for the offence)-or of asking him for something, which can be

more courteous even than giving. It also seems to me that the rudest word,the rudest letter, is more good-natured, more straightforward, than silence.

Those who keep silent are almost always lacking in subtlety and refinement

of heart; silence is an objection, to swallow a grievance must necessarily

produce  a  bad  temper-it  even  upsets  the  stomach.  All  silent  people  are

dyspeptic. You perceive that I should not like to see rudeness undervalued ; it

is by far the most humane form of contradiction, and, in the midst of modern

effeminacy, it is one of our first virtues. If one is sufficiently rich for it, it

may even be a joy to be wrong. If a god were to descend to this earth, he

would have to do nothing but wrong-to take guilt, not punishment, on one's

shoulders, is the first proof of divinity.

  s6

  Freedom  from  resentment  and  the  understanding  of  the  nature  of

resentment-who knows how very much after all I am indebted to my long

illness for these two things ? The problem is not exactly simple: a man must

have  experienced  both  through  his  strength  and  through  his  weakness.  If

illness and weakness are to be charged with anything at all, it is with the fact

that when they prevail, the very instinct of recovery, which is the instinct of.

defence and of war in man, becomes decayed. He knows not how to get rid of

anything, how to come to terms with anything, and how to cast anything

behind him. Everything wounds him. People and things draw importunately

near, all experiences strike deep, memory is a gathering wound. To be ill is a

sort of resentment in itself. Against this resentment the invalid has only one

great remedy-I call it Russian fatalism, that fatalism which is free from revolt,

and with which the Russian soldier, to whom a campaign proves unbearable,

ultimately  lays  himself  down  in  the  snow.  To  accept  nothing  more,  to

undertake  nothing  more,  to  absorb  nothing  more-to  cease  entirely  from

reacting. . . . The tremendous sagacity of this fatalism, which does not always

imply merely the courage for death, but which in the most dangerous cases

may actually constitute a self-preservative measure, amounts to a reduction of

activity in the vital functions, the slackening down of which is like a sort of

will to hibernate. A few steps farther in this direction we find the fakir, who

will sleep for weeks in a tomb......Owing to the fact that one would be used

up too quickly if one reacted, one no longer reacts at all: this is the principle.

And  nothing  on  earth  consumes  a  man  more  quickly  than  the  passion  of

resentment.  Mortification,  morbid  susceptibility,  the  inability  to  wreak

revenge, the desire and thirst for revenge, the concoction of every sort of

poison-this  is  surely  the  most  injurious  manner  of  reacting  which  couldpossibly be conceived by exhausted men. It involves a rapid wasting away of

nervous  energy,  an  abnormal  increase  of  detrimental  secretions,  as,  for

instance, that of bile into the stomach. To the sick man resentment ought to

be  more  strictly  forbidden  than  anything  else-  it  is  his  special  danger:

unfortunately, however, it is also his most natural propensity. This was fully

grasped  by  that  profound  physiologist  Buddha.  His  "  religion,"  which  it

would be better to call a system of hygiene, in order to avoid confounding it

with a creed so wretched as Christianity, depended for its effect upon the

triumph over resentment: to make the soul free from that was considered the

first step towards recovery. " Not through hostility is hostility put to flight;

through  friendship  does  hostility  end":  this  stands  at  the  beginning  of

Buddha's  teaching-  this  is  not  a  precept  of  morality,  but  of  physiology.

Resentment born of weakness is not more deleterious to anybody than it is to

the weak man himself conversely, in the case of that man whose nature ~

fundamentally a rich one, resentment is a superfluous feeling, a feeling to

remain master of which is almost a proof of riches. Those of my readers who

know  the  earnestness  with  which  my  philosophy  wages  war  against  the

feelings of revenge and rancour, even to the extent of attacking the doctrine

of " free will " (my conflict with Christianity is only a particular instance of

it), will understand why I wish to focus attention upon my own personal

attitude and the certainty of my practical instincts precisely in this matter. In

my  moments  of  decadence  I  forbade  myself  the  indulgence  of  the  above

feelings, because they were harmful; as soon as my life recovered enough

riches and pride, however, I regarded them again as forbidden, but this time

because they were beneath me. That " Russian fatalism " of which I have

spoken manifested itself in me in such a way that for years I held tenaciously

to almost insufferable conditions, places, habitations, and companions, once

chance had placed them on my path-it was better than changing them, than

feeling that they could be changed, than revolting against them. . . . He who

stirred  me  from  this  fatalism,  he  who  violently  tried  to  shake  me  into

consciousness, seemed to me then a mortal enemy-in point of fact, there was

danger of death each time this was done. To regard one's self as a destiny, not

to wish one's self " different "-this, in such circumstances, is sagacity itself.

  s7

  War, on the other hand, is something different. At heart I am a warrior.

Attacking  belongs  to  my  instincts.  To  be  able  to  be  an  enemy,  to  be  an

enemy-maybe these things presuppose a strong nature ; in any case all strongnatures involve these things. Such natures need resistance, consequently they

go in search of obstacles: the pathos of aggression belongs of necessity to

strength  as  much  as  the  feelings  of  revenge  and  of  rancour  belong  to

weakness. Woman, for instance, is revengeful; her weakness involves this

passion, just as it involves her susceptibility in the presence of other people's

suffering. The strength of the aggressor can be measured by the opposition

which he needs; every increase of growth betrays itself by a seeking out of

more formidable opponents-or problems : for a philosopher who is combative

challenges even problems to a duel. The task is not to overcome opponents in

general, but only those opponents against whom one has to summon all one's

strength,  one's  skill,  and  one's  swordsmanship-in  fact,  opponents  who  are

one's equals. . . . To be one's enemy's equal-this is the first condition of an

honourable  duel.  Where  one  despises,  one  cannot  wage  war.  Where  one

commands, where one sees something beneath one, one ought not to wage

war. My practice of war can be reduced to four principles : First, I attack only

things that are triumphant-if necessary I wait until they become triumphant.

Secondly, I attack only those things against which I find no allies, against

which I stand alone-against which I compromise nobody but myself. ... I have

not  yet  taken  one  single  step  before  the  public  eye,  which  did  not

compromise me: that is my criterion of a proper mode of action. Thirdly, I

never make personal attacks-I use a personality merely as a magnifying-glass,

by means of which I render a general, but elusive and scarcely noticeable

evil,  more  apparent.  In  this  way  I  attacked  David  Strauss,  or  rather  the

success given to a senile book by the cultured classes of Germany -by this

means I caught German culture red-handed. In this way I attacked Wagner, or

rather the falsity or mongrel instincts of our " culture " which confounds the

super-refined with the strong, and the effete with the great. Fourthly, I attack

only those things from which all personal differences are excluded, in which

any such thing as a background of disagreeable experiences is lacking. On the

contrary, attacking is to me a proof of goodwill and, in certain circumstances,

of gratitude. By means of it, I do honour to a thing, I distinguish a thing ;

whether I associate my name with that of an institution or a person, by being

against or for either, is all the same to me. If I wage war against Christianity,

I feel justified in doing so, because in that quarter I have met with no fatal

experiences  and  difficulties-the  most  earnest  Christians  have  always  been

kindly  disposed  to  me.  I,  personally,  the  most  essential  opponent  of

Christianity, am far from holding the individual responsible for what is thefatality of long ages.

  s8

  May I be allowed to hazard a suggestion concerning one last trait in my

character, which in my intercourse with other men has led me into some

difficulties ? I am gifted with a sense of cleanliness the keenness of which is

phenomenal; so much so, that I can ascertain physiologically-that is to say,

smell-the proximity, nay, the inmost core, the " entrails " of every human

soul. . . . This sensitiveness of mine is furnished with psychological antennae,

wherewith I feel and grasp every secret: the quality of concealed filth lying at

the base of many a human character which may be the inevitable outcome of

base blood, and which education may have veneered, is revealed to me at the

first glance. If my observation has been correct, such people, whom my sense

of  cleanliness  rejects,  also  become  conscious,  on  their  part,  of  the

cautiousness to which my loathing prompts me: and this does not make them

any more fragrant. ... In keeping with a custom which I have long observed,-

pure habits and honesty towards myself are among the first conditions of my

existence, I would die in unclean surroundings,-I swim, bathe, and splash

about, as it were, incessantly in water, in any kind of perfectly transparent

and  shining  element.  That  is  why  my  relations  with  my  fellows  try  my

patience to no small extent; my humanity does not consist in the fact that I

understand the feelings of my fellows, but that I can endure to understand. . .

. My humanity is a perpetual process of self-mastery. But I need solitude-that

is to say, recovery, return to myself, the breathing of free, crisp, bracing air. .

. . The whole of my Zarathustra is a dithyramb in honour of solitude, or, if I

have been understood, in honour of purity. Thank Heaven, it is not in honour

of " pure foolery " ! * He who has an eye for colour will call him a diamond.

The loathing of mankind, of the rabble, was always my greatest danger. . . .

Would you listen to the words spoken by Zarathustra concerning deliverance

from loathing? " What in truth hath come unto me ? How did I deliver myself

from loathing? Who hath made mine eye younger ? How did I soar to the

height, where there are no more rabble sitting about the well? " Did my very

loathing forge me wings and the strength to scent fountains afar off? Verily to

the  loftiest  heights  did  I  need  to  fly,  to  find  once  more  the  spring  of

joyfulness. " Oh, I found it, my brothers ! Up here, on the loftiest height, the

spring of joyfulness gushes forth for me. And there is a life at the well of

which no rabble can drink with you. " Almost too fiercely do you rush, for

me, you spring of joyfulness ! And oft times do you empty the pitcher againin trying to fill it. " And yet must I learn to draw near you more humbly. Far

too  eagerly  does  my  heart  jump  to  meet  you.  "  My  heart,  whereon  my

summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy, over-blessed summer: how my

summer heart yearns for your coolness ! * This, of course, is a reference to

Wagner's Parsifal. See my note on p. 96

  of The Will to Power, vol. i.-Tr. " Farewell, the lingering affliction of my

spring ! Past is the wickedness of my snowflakes in June! Summer have I

become entirely, and summer noontide! " A summer in the loftiest heights,

with cold springs and blessed stillness: oh come, my friends, that the stillness

may wax even more blessed! " For this is our height and our home: too high

and steep is our dwelling for all the unclean and their appetites. " Do but cast

your pure eyes into the well of my joyfulness, my friends ! How could it thus

become muddy ! It will laugh back at you with its purity. " On the tree called

Future do we build our nest: eagles shall bring food in their beaks unto us

lonely ones! " Verily not the food whereof the unclean might partake. They

would think they ate fire and would burn their mouths! " Verily, no abodes

for the unclean do we here hold in readiness ! To their bodies our happiness

would seem an ice-cavern, and to their spirits also ! " And like strong winds

will we live above them, neighbours to the eagles, companions of the snow,

and playmates of the sun: thus do strong winds live. " And like a wind shall I

one day blow amidst them, and take away their soul's breath with my spirit:

thus my future wills it. " Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low lands;

and this is his counsel to his foes and to all those who spit and spew: ' Beware

of spitting against the wind !' "

                          PART 2 - WHY I AM SO CLEVER

  s1

  Why do I know more things than other people ? Why, in fact, am I so

clever ? I have never pondered over questions that are not questions. I have

never squandered my strength. Of actual religious difficulties, for instance, I

have no experience. I have never known what it is to feel " sinful." In the

same  way  I  completely  lack  any  reliable  criterion  for  ascertaining  what

constitutes a prick of conscience : from all accounts a prick of conscience

does not seem to be a very estimable thing. . . . Once it was done I should

hate to leave an action of mine in the lurch ; I should prefer completely to

omit the evil outcome, the consequences, from the problem concerning the

value of an action. In the face of evil consequences one is too ready to lose

the proper standpoint from which one's deed ought to be considered. A prickof conscience strikes me as a sort of " evil eye." Something that has failed

should be honoured all the more jealously, precisely because it has failed-this

is much more in keeping with my morality.-" God," " the immortality of the

soul," "salvation,"a "beyond"-to all these notions, even as a child, I never

paid any attention whatsoever, nor did I waste any time upon them,-maybe I

was never naif enough for that ?-I am quite unacquainted with atheism as a

result, and still less as an event in my life.: in me it is inborn, instinctive. I am

too inquisitive, too incredulous, too high spirited, to be satisfied with such a

palpably clumsy solution of things. God is a too palpably clumsy solution of

things ; a solution which shows a lack of delicacy towards us thinkers-at

bottom He is really no more than a coarse and rude prohibition of us: you

shall  not  think  !  .  .  .  I  am  much  more  interested  in  another  question,-a

question upon which the " salvation of humanity " depends to a far greater

degree  than  it  does  upon  any  piece  of  theological  curiosity:  I  refer  to

nutrition. For ordinary purposes, it may be formulated as follows : " How

precisely  must  you  feed  yourself  in  order  to  attain  to  your  maximum  of

power, or virtu in the Renaissance style,-of virtue free from moralic acid ? "

My experiences in regard to this matter have been as bad as they possibly

could be ; I am surprised that I set myself this question so late in life, and that

it took me so long to draw " rational " conclusions from my experiences.

Only the absolute worth-lessness of German culture-its " idealism "-can to

some  extent  explain  how  it  was  that  precisely  in  this  matter  I  was  so

backward that my ignorance was almost saintly. This "culture," which from

first  to  last  teaches  one  to  lose  sight  of  actual  things  and  to  hunt  after

thoroughly problematic and so-called ideal aims, as, for instance, " classical

culture "�-as if it were not hopeless from the start to try to unite " classical "

and " German" in one concept. It is even a little comical-try and imagine a "

classically cultured " citizen of Leipzig!-Indeed, I can say, that up to a very

mature  age,  my  food  was  entirely  bad  -  expressed  morally,  it  was

"impersonal," " selfless," " altruistic," to the glory of cooks and all other

fellow-Christians.  It  was  through  the  cooking  in  vogue  at  Leipzig,  for

instance,  together  with  my  first  study  of  Schopenhauer  (1865),  that  I

earnestly renounced my " Will to Live." To spoil one's stomach by absorbing

insufficient  nourishment-this  problem  seemed  to  my  mind  solved  with

admirable felicity by the above-mentioned cookery. (It is said that in the year

1866

  changes were introduced into this department.) But as to German cookeryin general- what has it not got on its conscience! Soup before the meal (still

called alia tedesca in the Venetian cookery books of the sixteenth century) ;

meat boiled to shreds, vegetables cooked with fat and flour; the degeneration

of pastries into paperweights ! And, if you add thereto the absolutely bestial

post-prandial drinking habits of the ancients, and not alone of the ancient

Germans, you will understand where German intellect took its origin- that is

to say, in sadly disordered intestines. . . . German intellect is indigestion; it

can  assimilate  nothing.  But  even  English  diet,  which  in  comparison  with

German, and indeed with French alimentation, seems to me to constitute a "

return to Nature,"-that is to say, to cannibalism,-is profoundly opposed to my

own  instincts.  It  seems  to  me  to  give  the  intellect  heavy  feet,  in  fact,

Englishwomen's feet. . . . The best cooking is that of Piedmont. Alcoholic

drinks do not agree with me; a single glass of wine or beer a day is amply

sufficient  to  turn  life  into  a  valley  of  tears  for  me;-in  Munich  live  my

antipodes. Although I admit that this knowledge came to me somewhat late,

it already formed part of my experience even as a child. As a boy I believed

that the drinking of wine and the smoking of tobacco were at first but the

vanities  of  youths,  and  later  merely  bad  habits.  Maybe  the  poor  wine  of

Naumburg was partly responsible for this poor opinion of wine in general. In

order  to  believe  that  wine  was  exhilarating,  I  should  have  had  to  be  a

Christian-in other words, I should have had to believe in what, to my mind, is

an absurdity. Strange to say, whereas small quantities of alcohol, taken with

plenty of water, succeed in making me feel out of sorts, large quantities turn

me almost into a rollicking tar. Even as a boy I showed my bravado in this

respect. To compose a long Latin essay in one night, to revise and recopy it,

to aspire with my pen to emulating the exactitude and the terseness of my

model, Sallust, and to pour a few very strong grogs over it all-this mode of

procedure, while I was a pupil at the venerable old school of Pforta, was not

in the least out of keeping with my physiology, nor perhaps with that of

Sallust, however much it may have been alien to dignified Pforta. Later on,

towards the middle of my life, I grew more and more opposed to alcoholic

drinks  :  I,  an  opponent  of  vegetarianism,  who  have  experienced  what

vegetarianism  is,-just  as  Wagner,  who  converted  me  back  to  meat,

experienced it,-cannot with sufficient earnestness advise all more spiritual

natures to abstain absolutely from alcohol. Water answers the purpose. ... I

have a predilection in favour of those places where in all directions one has

opportunities of drinking from running brooks (Nice, Turin, Sils). In vinoveritas: it seems that here once more I am at variance with the rest of the

world about the concept " Truth "-with me spirit moves on the face of the

waters. . . . Here are a few more indications as to my morality. A heavy meal

is digested more easily than an inadequate one. The first principle of a good

digestion is that the stomach should become active as a whole. A man ought,

therefore, to know the size of his stomach. For the same reasons all those

interminable meals, which I call interrupted sacrificial feasts, and which are

to be had at any table d'h6te, are strongly to be deprecated. Nothing should be

eaten between meals, coffee should be given up-coffee makes one gloomy.

Tea is beneficial only in the morning. It should be taken in small quantities,

but very strong. It may be very harmful, and indispose you for the whole day,

if it be taken the least bit too weak. Everybody has his own standard in this

matter, often between the narrowest and most delicate limits. In an enervating

climate tea is not a good beverage with which to start the day: an hour before

taking it an excellent thing is to drink a cup of thick cocoa, freed from oil.

Remain seated as little as possible, put no trust in any thought that is not born

in the open, to the accompaniment of free bodily motion-nor in one in which

even the muscles do not celebrate a feast. All prejudices take their origin in

the intestines. A sedentary life, as I have already said elsewhere, is the real

sin against the Holy Spirit.

  s2

  To the question of nutrition, that of locality and climate is next of kin.

Nobody is so constituted as to be able to live everywhere and anywhere; and

he who has great duties to perform, which lay claim to all his strength, has, in

this respect, a very limited choice. The influence of climate upon the bodily

functions, affecting their acceleration or retardation, extends so far, that a

blunder in the choice of locality and climate is able not only to alienate a man

from his actual duty, but also to withhold it from him altogether, so that he

never even comes face to face with it. Animal vigour never acquires enough

strength in him in order to reach that pitch of artistic freedom which makes

his own soul whisper to him: I, alone, can do that. . . . Ever so slight a

tendency to laziness in the intestines, once it has become a habit, is quite

sufficient  to  make  something  mediocre,  something  "  German  "  out  of  a

genius; the climate of Germany, alone, is enough to discourage the strongest

and most heroically disposed intestines. The tempo of the body's functions is

closely bound up with the agility or the clumsiness of the spirit's feet; spirit

itself is indeed only a form of these organic functions. Let anybody make alist of the places in which men of great intellect have been found, and are still

found; where wit, subtlety, and malice constitute happiness ; where genius is

almost necessarily at home : all of them rejoice in exceptionally dry air. Paris,

Provence, Florence, Jerusalem, Athens-these names prove something, namely

: that genius is conditioned by dry air, by a pure sky-that is to say, by rapid

organic functions, by the constant and ever-present possibility of procuring

for one's self great and even enormous quantities of strength. I have a certain

case in mind in which a man of remarkable intellect and independent spirit

became a narrow, craven specialist and a grumpy old crank, simply owing to

a lack of subtlety in his instinct for climate. And I myself might have been an

example of the same thing, if illness had not compelled me to reason, and to

reflect upon reason realistically. Now that I have learnt through long practice

to read the effects of climatic and meteorological influences, from my own

body, as though from a very delicate and reliable instrument, and that I am

able to calculate the change in degrees of atmospheric moisture by means of

physiological observations upon myself, even on so short a journey as that

from Turin to Milan ; I think with horror of the ghastly fact that my whole

life, until the last ten years,-the most perilous years,-has always been spent in

the wrong, and what to me ought to have been the most forbidden, places.

Naumburg, Pforta, Thuringia in general, Leipzig, Bale, Venice-so many ill-

starred places for a constitution like mine. If I cannot recall one single happy

reminiscence of my childhood and youth, it is nonsense to suppose that so-

called  "  moral"  causes  could  account  for  this-as,  for  instance,  the

incontestable fact that I lacked companions that could have satisfied me; for

this fact is the same to-day as it ever was, and it does not prevent me from

being cheerful and brave. But it was ignorance in physiological matters-that

confounded " Idealism "-that was the real curse of my life. This was the

superfluous  and  foolish  element  in  my  existence;  something  from  which

nothing  could  spring,  and  for  which  there  can  be  no  settlement  and  no

compensation. As the outcome of this " Idealism" I regard all the blunders,

the great aberrations of instinct, and the " modest specialisations " which

drew me aside from the task of my life ; as, for instance, the fact that I

became a philologist-why not at least a medical man or anything else which

might have opened my eyes ? My days at Bale, the whole of my intellectual

routine, including my daily time-table, was an absolutely senseless abuse of

extraordinary powers, without the slightest compensation for the strength that

I spent, without even a thought of what I was squandering and how its placemight be filled. I lacked all subtlety in egoism, all the fostering care of an

imperative instinct; I was in a state in which one is ready to regard one's self

as  anybody's  equal,  a  state  of  "  disinterestedness,"  a  forgetting  of  one's

distance  from  others-something,  in  short,  for  which  I  can  never  forgive

myself. When I had well-nigh reached the end of my tether, simply because I

had almost reached my end, I began to reflect upon the fundamental absurdity

of my life-" Idealism." It was illness that first brought me to reason.

  s3

  After the choice of nutrition, the choice of climate and locality, the third

matter concerning which one must not on any account make a blunder, is the

choice of the manner in which one recuperates one's strength. Here, again,

according to the extent to which a spirit is sui generis, the limits of that which

he can allow himself-in other words, the limits of that which is beneficial to

him-become more and more confined. As far as I in particular am concerned,

reading  in  general  belongs  to  my  means  of  recuperation;  consequently  it

belongs to that which rids me of myself, to that which enables me to wander

in strange sciences and strange souls- to that, in fact, about which I am no

longer  in  earnest.  Indeed,  it  is  while  reading  that  I  recover  from  my

earnestness. During the time that I am deeply absorbed in my work, no books

are found within my reach ; it would never occur to me to allow anyone to

speak or even to think in my presence. For that is what reading would mean. .

.  .  Has  anyone  ever  actually  noticed,  that,  during  the  period  of  profound

tension to which the state of pregnancy condemns not only the mind, but also,

at bottom, the whole organism, accident and every kind of external stimulus

acts too acutely and strikes too deep ? Accident and external stimuli must, as

far as possible, be avoided : a sort of walling-of-one's-self-in is one of the

primary instinctive precautions of spiritual pregnancy. Shall I allow a strange

thought to steal secretly over the wall ? For that is what reading would mean.

.  .  .  The  periods  of  work  and  fruit-fulness  are  followed  by  periods  of

recuperation:  come  hither,  you  delightful,  intellectual,  intelligent  books  !

Shall I read German books ? . . . I must go back six months to catch myself

with  a  book  in  my  hand.  What  was  it  ?  An  excellent  study  by  Victor

Brochard  upon  the  Greek  sceptics,  in  which  my  Laertiana*  was  used  to

advantage. The sceptics !-the only honourable types among that double-faced

and sometimes quintuple-faced throng, the philosophers ! . . . Otherwise I

almost  always  take  refuge  in  the  same  books:  altogether  their  number  is

small; they are books which are precisely my proper fare. It is not perhaps inmy nature to read much, and of all sorts : a library makes me ill. Neither is it

my nature to love much or many kinds of things. Suspicion or even hostility

towards  new  books  is  much  more  akin  to  my  instinctive  feeling  than  "

toleration," largeur de cceur, and other forms of " neighbour-love." . . . It is to

a small number of old French authors, that I always return again and again; I

believe only in French culture, and regard everything else in Europe which

calls itself " culture " as a misunderstanding. I do not even take the German

kind into consideration. . . . The few instances of higher culture with which I

have  met  in  Germany  were  all  French  in  their  origin.  The  most  striking

example of this was Madame Cosima Wagner, by far the most decisive voice

in matters of taste that I have ever heard. If I do not read, but literally love

Pascal, as the most instinctive sacrifice to Christianity, killing himself inch by

inch, first bodily, then spiritually, according to the terrible consistency of this

most appalling form of inhuman cruelty ; if I have something of Montaigne's

mischievousness in my soul, and-who knows ?-perhaps also in my body ; if

my artist's taste endeavours to defend the names of Moliere, Corneille, and

Racine,  and  not  without  bitterness,  against  such  a  wild  genius  as

Shakespeare-all this does not prevent me from regarding even the latter-day

Frenchmen  also  as  charming  companions.  I  can  think  of  absolutely  no

century in history, in which a netful of more inquisitive and at the same time

more subtle psychologists could be drawn up together than in the Paris of the

present  day.  Let  me  mention  a  few  at  random-for  their  number  is  by  no

means small-Paul Bourget, Pierre Loti, Gyp, Meilhac, Anatole France, Jules

Lemaitre; or, to point to one of strong race, a genuine Latin, of whom I am

particularly  fond,  Guy  de  Maupassant.  Between  ourselves,  I  prefer  this

generation  even  to  its  masters,  all  of  whom  were  corrupted  by  German

philosophy  (Taine,  for  instance,  by  Hegel,  whom  he  has  to  thank  for  his

misunderstanding  of  great  men  and  great  periods).  Wherever  Germany

extends her sway, she ruins culture. It was the war which first saved the spirit

of  France.  .  .  .  Stendhal  is  one  of  the  happiest  accidents  of  my  life-for

everything that marks an epoch in it has been brought to me by accident and

never  by  means  of  a  recommendation.  He  is  quite  priceless,  with  his

psychologist's eye, quick at forestalling and anticipating ; with his grasp of

facts, which is reminiscent of the same art in the greatest of all masters of

facts (ex ungue Napo-leonem) ; and, last but not least, as an honest atheist -a

specimen which is both rare and difficult to discover in France-all honour to

Prosper Meri-mee ! . . . Maybe that I am even envious of Stendhal ? Herobbed  me  of  the  best  atheistic  joke,  which  I  of  all  people  could  have

perpetrated : " God's only excuse is that He does not exist." ... I myself have

said somewhere-What has been the greatest objection to Life until now ?-

God. . . .

  s4

  It  was  Heinrich  Heine  who  gave  me  the  most  perfect  idea  of  what  a

lyrical  poet  could  be.  In  vain  do  I  search  through  all  the  kingdoms  of

antiquity  or  of  modern  times  for  anything  to  resemble  his  sweet  and

passionate  music.  He  possessed  that  divine  wickedness,  without  which

perfection itself becomes unthinkable to me,-I estimate the value of men, of

races, according to the extent to which they are unable to conceive of a god

who has not a dash of the satyr in him. And with what mastery he wields his

native tongue ! One day it will be said of Heine and me that we were by far

the greatest artists of the German language that have ever existed, and that we

left all the efforts that mere Germans made in this language an incalculable

distance behind us. I must be profoundly related to Byron's Manfred: of all

the dark abysses in this work I found the counterparts in my own soul-at the

age of thirteen I was ripe for this book. Words fail me, I have only a look, for

those who dare to utter the name of Faust in the presence of Manfred. The

Germans are incapable of conceiving anything sublime : for a proof of this,

look at Schumann ! Out of anger for this mawkish Saxon, I once deliberately

composed a counter-overture to Manfred, of which Hans von Bulow declared

he had never seen the like before on paper: such compositions amounted to a

violation  of  Euterpe.  When  I  cast  about  me  for  my  highest  formula  of

Shakespeare, I find invariably but this one : that he conceived the type of

Caesar. Such things a man cannot guess- he either is the thing, or he is not.

The great poet draws his creations only from out of his own reality. This is so

to such an extent, that often after a lapse of time he can no longer endure his

own work. . . . After casting a glance between the pages of my Zarathustra, I

pace my room to and fro for half an hour at a time, unable to overcome an

insufferable  fit  of  tears.  I  know  of  no  more  heartrending  reading  than

Shakespeare: how a man must have suffered to be so much in need of playing

the clown ! Is Hamlet understood"} It is not doubt, but certitude that drives

one mad. . . . But in order to feel this, one must be profound, one must be an

abyss, a philosopher. . . . We all fear the truth. . . . And, to make a confession;

I feel instinctively certain and convinced that Lord Bacon is the originator,

the self-torturer, of this most sinister kind of literature: what do I care aboutthe miserable gabble of American muddlers and blockheads ? But the power

for the greatest realism in vision is not only compatible with the greatest

realism  in  deeds,  with  the  monstrous  in  deeds,  with  crime-it  actually

presupposes the latter. . . . We do not know half enough about Lord Bacon-

the  first  realist  in  all  the  highest  acceptation  of  this  word-to  be  sure  of

everything he did, everything he willed, and everything he experienced in his

inmost soul. . . . Let the critics go to hell! Suppose I had christened my

Zarathustra  with  a  name  not  my  own,-let  us  say  with  Richard  Wagner's

name,-the acumen of two thousand years would not have sufficed to guess

that the author of Human, all-too-Human was the visionary of Zarathustra.

  s5

  As I am speaking here of the recreations of my life, I feel I must express a

word or two of gratitude for that which has refreshed me by far the most

heartily  and  most  profoundly.  This,  without  the  slightest  doubt,  was  my

intimate relationship with Richard Wagner. All my other relationships with

men I treat quite lightly; but I would not have the days I spent at Tribschen-

those  days  of  confidence,  of  cheerfulness,  of  sublime  flashes,  and  of

profound  moments-blotted  from  my  life  at  any  price.  I  know  not  what

Wagner may have been for others; but no cloud ever darkened our sky. And

this brings me back again to France,-I have no arguments against Wagnerites,

and  hoc  genus  omne,  who  believe  that  they  do  honour  to  Wagner  by

believing  him  to  be  like  themselves;  for  such  people  I  have  only  a

contemptuous curl of my lip. With a nature like mine, which is so strange to

everything  Teutonic,  that  even  the  presence  of  a  German  retards  my

digestion, my first meeting with Wagner was the first moment in my life in

which I breathed freely: I felt him, I honoured him, as a foreigner, as the

opposite and the incarnate contradiction of all " German virtues." We who as

children  breathed  the  marshy  atmosphere  of  the  fifties,  are  necessarily

pessimists in regard to the concept " German"; we cannot be anything else

than revolutionaries-we can assent to no state of affairs which allows the

canting bigot to be at the top. I care not a jot whether this canting bigot acts

in different colours to-day, whether he dresses in scarlet or dons the uniform

of a hussar.* Very well, then! Wagner was a revolutionary--he fled from the

Germans.... As an artist, a man has no home in Europe save in Paris; that

subtlety of all the five senses which Wagner's art presupposes, those fingers

that can detect slight gradations, psychological morbidity-all these things can

be found only in Paris. Nowhere else can you meet with this passion forquestions of form, this earnestness in matters of mise-en-scene, which is the

Parisian earnestness par excellence. In Germany no one has any idea of the

tremendous ambition that fills the heart of a Parisian artist. The German is a

good fellow. Wagner was by no means a good fellow. . . . But I have already

said quite enough on the subject of Wagner's real nature (see Beyond Good

and Evil, Aphorism 256), and about those to whom he is most closely related.

He  is  one  of  the  late  French  romanticists,  that  high-soaring  and  heaven-

aspiring  band  of  artists,  like  Delacroix  and  Berlioz,  who  in  their  inmost

natures are sick and incurable, and who are all fanatics of expression, and

virtuosos through and through. . . . Who, in sooth, was the first intelligent

follower of Wagner? Charles Baudelaire, the very man who first understood

Delacroix--that typical decadent, in whom a whole generation of artists saw

their reflection; he was perhaps the last of them too. . . . What is it that I have

never forgiven Wagner ? The fact that he condescended to the Germans-that

he became a German Imperialist. . . . Wherever Germany spreads, she ruins

culture.

  s6

  Taking everything into consideration, I could never have survived my

youth  without  Wagnerian  music.  For  I  was  condemned  to  the  society  of

Germans. If a man wish to get rid of a feeling of insufferable oppression, he

has to take to hashish. Well, I had to take to Wagner. Wagner is the counter-

poison to everything essentially German- the fact that he is a poison too, I do

not  deny.  From  the  moment  that  Tristan  was  arranged  for  the  piano  -all

honour to you, Herr von Blow!-I was a Wagnerite. Wagner's previous works

seemed beneath me-they were too commonplace, too " German." . . . But to

this day I am still seeking for a work which would be a match to Tristan in

dangerous fascination, and possess the same gruesome and dulcet quality of

infinity ; I seek among all the arts in vain. All the quaint features of Leonardo

da Vinci's work lose their charm at the sound of the first bar in Tristan. This

work  is  without  question  Wagner's  non  plus  ultra  ;  after  its  creation,  the

composition of the Mastersingers and of the Ring was a relaxation to him. To

become  more  healthy-this  in  a  nature  like  Wagner's  amounts  to  going

backwards. The curiosity of the psychologist is so great in me, that I regard it

as quite a special privilege to have lived at the right time, and to have lived

precisely among Germans, in order to be ripe for this work. The world must

indeed be empty for him who has never been unhealthy enough for this "

infernal voluptuousness " : it is allowable, it is even imperative, to employ amystic formula for this purpose. I suppose I know better than anyone the

prodigious feats of which Wagner was capable, the fifty worlds of strange

ecstasies to which no one else had wings to soar; and as I am alive to-day and

strong enough to turn even the most suspicious and most dangerous things to

my own advantage, and thus to grow stronger, I declare Wagner to have been

the greatest benefactor of my life. The bond which unites us is the fact that

we have suffered greater agony, even at each other's hands, than most men

are able to bear nowadays, and this will always keep our names associated in

the minds of men. For, just as Wagner is merely a misunderstanding among

Germans, so, in truth, am I, and ever will be. You lack two centuries of

psychological and artistic discipline, my dear countrymen ! . . . But you can

never recover the time lost.

  s7

  To the most exceptional of my readers I should like to say just one word

about what I really exact from music. It must be cheerful and yet profound,

like an October afternoon. It must be original, exuberant, and tender, and like

a dainty, soft woman in roguishness and grace. ... I shall never admit that a

German  can  understand  what  music  is.  Those  musicians  who  are  called

German, the greatest and most famous foremost, are all foreigners, either

Slavs, Croats, Italians, Dutchmen-or Jews ; or else, like Heinrich Schiitz,

Bach, and Handel, they are Germans of a strong race which is now extinct.

For my own part, I have still enough of the Pole left in me to let all other

music  go,  if  only  I  can  keep  Chopin.  For  three  reasons  I  would  except

Wagner's Siegfried Idyll, and perhaps also one or two things of Liszt, who

excelled all other musicians in the noble tone of his orchestration ; and finally

everything that has been produced beyond the Alps -this side of the Alps.* I

could not possibly dispense with Rossini, and still less with my Southern soul

in music, the work of my Venetian maestro, Pietro Gasti. And when I say

beyond the Alps, all I really mean is Venice. If I try to find a new word for

music, I can never find any other than Venice. I know not how to draw any

distinction between tears and music. I do not know how to think either of joy,

or of the south, without a shudder of fear. On the bridge I stood Lately, in

gloomy  night.  Came  a  distant  song  :  In  golden  drops  it  rolled  Over  the

glittering rim away. Music, gondolas, lights- Drunk, swam far forth in the

gloom. . . - A stringed instrument, my soul, Sang, imperceptibly moved, A

gondola song by stealth, Gleaming for gaudy blessedness. �-'Listened any

thereto ?  s8

  In all these things-in the choice of food, place, climate, and recreation-the

instinct of self-preservation is dominant, and this instinct manifests itself with

least ambiguity when it acts as an instinct of defence. To close one's eyes to

much, to seal one's ears to much, to keep certain things at a distance-this is

the first principle of prudence, the first proof of the fact that a man is not an

accident but a necessity. The popular word for this instinct of defence is taste.

A man's imperative command is not only to say " no" in cases where " yes "

would be a sign of " disinterestedness," but also to say " no " as seldom as

possible. One must part with all that which compels one to repeat "no," with

ever greater frequency. The rationale of this principle is that all discharges of

defensive  forces,  however  slight  they  may  be,  involve  enormous  and

absolutely superfluous losses when they become regular and habitual. Our

greatest expenditure of strength is made up of those small and most frequent

discharges of it. The act of keeping things off, of holding them at a distance,

amounts to a discharge of strength,- do not deceive yourselves on this point!-

and an expenditure of energy directed at purely negative ends. Simply by

being compelled to keep constantly on his guard, a man may grow so weak as

to be unable any longer to defend himself. Suppose I were to step out of my

house, and, instead of the quiet and aristocratic city of Turin, I were to find a

German provincial town, my instinct would have to brace itself together in

order to repel all that which would pour in upon it from this crushed-down

and  cowardly  world.  Or  suppose  I  were  to  find  a  large  German  city-that

structure  of  vice  in  which  nothing  grows,  but  where  every  single  thing,

whether good or bad, is squeezed in from outside. In such circumstances

should I not be compelled to become a hedgehog ? But to have prickles

amounts to a squandering of strength; they even constitute a twofold luxury,

when, if we only chose to do so, we could dispense with them and open our

hands instead. . . . Another form of prudence and self-defence consists in

trying to react as seldom as possible, and to keep one's self aloof from those

circumstances and conditions wherein one would be condemned, as it were,

to suspend one's " liberty " and one's initiative, and become a mere reacting

medium. As an example of this I point to the intercourse with books. The

scholar who, in sooth, does little else than handle books-with the philologist

of  average  attainments  their  number  may  amount  to  two  hundred  a  day-

ultimately  forgets  entirely  and  completely  the  capacity  of  thinking  for

himself. When he has not a book between his fingers he cannot think. Whenhe thinks, he responds to a stimulus (a thought he has read),-finally all he

does is to react. The scholar exhausts his whole strength in saying either " yes

" or " no " to matter which has already been thought out, or in criticising it-he

is no longer capable of thought on his own account. ... In him the instinct of

self-defence has decayed, otherwise he would defend himself against books.

The  scholar  is  a  decadent.  With  my  own  eyes  I  have  seen  gifted,  richly

endowed, and free-spirited natures already " read to ruins" at thirty, and mere

wax vestas that have to be rubbed before they can give off any sparks -or "

thoughts." To set to early in the morning, at the break of day, in all the

fullness and dawn of one's strength, and to read a book-this I call positively

vicious !

  s9

  At this point I can no longer evade a direct answer to the question, how

one becomes what one is. And in giving it, I shall have to touch upon that

masterpiece in the art of self-preservation, which is selfishness. . . . Granting

that one's life-task-the determination and the fate of one's life-task-greatly

exceeds the average measure of such things, nothing more dangerous could

be conceived than to come face to face with one's self by the side of this life-

task. The fact that one becomes what one is, presupposes that one has not the

remotest suspicion of what one is. From this standpoint even the blunders of

one's life have their own meaning and value, the temporary deviations and

aberrations,  the  moments  of  hesitation  and  of  modesty,  the  earnestness

wasted upon duties which lie outside the actual life-task. In these matters

great wisdom, perhaps even the highest wisdom, comes into activity : in these

circumstances,  in  which  nosce  teipsum  would  be  the  sure  road  to  ruin,

forgetting  one's  self,  misunderstanding  one's  self,  belittling  one's  self,

narrowing one's self, and making one's self mediocre, amount to reason itself.

Expressed morally, to love one's neighbour and to live for others and for

other things may be the means of protection employed to maintain the hardest

kind  of  egoism.  This  is  the  exceptional  case  in  which  I,  contrary  to  my

principle and conviction, take the side of the altruistic instincts; for here they

are  concerned  in  subserving  selfishness  and  self-discipline.  The  whole

surface  of  consciousness-for  consciousness  is  a  surface-must  be  kept  free

from anyone of the great imperatives. Beware even of every striking word, of

every striking attitude ! They are all so many risks which the instinct runs of"

understanding itself" too soon. Meanwhile the organising " idea," which is

destined to become master, grows and continues to grow into the depths,-itbegins  to  command,  it  leads  you  slowly  back  from  your  deviations  and

aberrations, it prepares individual qualities and capacities, which one day will

make themselves felt as indispensable to the whole of your task,-step by step

it  cultivates  all  the  serviceable  faculties,  before  it  ever  whispers  a  word

concerning the dominant task, the " goal," the " object," and the " meaning "

of it all. Looked at from this standpoint my life is simply amazing. For the

task of transvaluing values, more capacities were needful perhaps than could

well  be  found  side  by  side  in  one  individual;  and  above  all,  antagonistic

capacities which had to be free from the mutual strife and destruction which

they  involve.  An  order  of  rank  among  capacities  ;  distance  ;  the  art  of

separating without creating hostility ; to refrain from confounding things; to

keep from reconciling things; to possess enormous multifarious-ness and yet

to be the reverse of chaos-all this was the first condition, the long secret

work,  and  the  artistic  mastery  of  my  instinct.  Its  superior  guardianship

manifested itself with such exceeding strength, that not once did I ever dream

of what was growing within me-until suddenly all my capacities were ripe,

and one day burst forth in all the perfection of their highest bloom. I cannot

remember ever having exerted myself, I can point to no trace of struggle in

my life; I am the reverse of a heroic nature. To " will" something, to " strive"

after something, to have an " aim " or a " desire " in my mind-I know none of

these things from experience. Even at this moment I look out upon my future-

a broad future !-as upon a calm sea: no sigh of longing makes a ripple on its

surface. I have not the slightest wish that anything should be otherwise than it

is : I myself would not be otherwise. . . . But in this matter I have always

been the same. I have never had a desire. A man who, after his four-and-

fortieth  year,  can  say  that  he  has  never  bothered  himself  about  honours,

women, or money ! -not that they did not come his way. ... It was thus that I

became one day a University Professor -I had never had the remotest idea of

such a thing; for I was scarcely four-and-twenty years of age. In the same

way, two years previously, I had one day become a philologist, in the sense

that my first philological work, my start in every way, was expressly obtained

by my master Ritschl for publication in his Rheinisckes Museum (Ritschl -

and I say it in all reverence-was the only genial scholar that I have ever met.

He  possessed  that  pleasant  kind  of  depravity  which  distinguishes  us

Thuringians,  and  which  makes  even  a  German  sympathetic-even  in  the

pursuit of truth we prefer to avail ourselves of roundabout ways. In saying

this I do not mean to underestimate in any way my Thuringian brother, theintelligent Leopold von Ranke, . . .)

  s10

  You may be wondering why I should actually have related all these trivial

and,  according  to  traditional  accounts,  insignificant  details  to  you  ;  such

action can but tell against me, more particularly if I am fated to figure in great

causes. To this I reply that these trivial matters �-diet, locality, climate, and

one's mode of recreation, the whole casuistry of self-love-are inconceivably

more important than all that which has until now been held in high esteem. It

is precisely in this quarter that we must begin to learn afresh. All those things

which mankind has valued with such earnestness heretofore are not even real;

they are mere creations of fancy, or, more strictly speaking, lies born of the

evil instincts of diseased and, in the deepest sense, noxious natures-all the

concepts, " God," " soul," " virtue," " sin," " Beyond," " truth," " eternal life."

... But the greatness of human nature, its " divinity," was sought for in them. .

. . All questions of politics, of social order, of education, have been falsified,

root and branch, owing to the fact that the most noxious men have been taken

for great men, and that people were taught to despise the small things, or

rather the fundamental things, of life. If I now choose to compare myself with

those creatures who have until now been honoured as the first among men,

the difference becomes obvious. I do not reckon the so-called " first" men

even  as  human  beings-  for  me  they  are  the  excrements  of  mankind,  the

products of disease and of the instinct of revenge : they are so many monsters

laden with rottenness, so many hopeless incurables, who avenge themselves

on life. ... I wish to be the opposite of these people: it is my privilege to have

the very sharpest discernment for every sign of healthy instincts. There is no

such thing as a morbid trait in me ; even in times of serious illness I have

never grown morbid, and you might seek in vain for a trace of fanaticism in

my nature. No one can point to any moment of my life in which I have

assumed either an arrogant or a pathetic attitude. Pathetic attitudes are not in

keeping with greatness; he who needs attitudes is false. . . . Beware of all

picturesque men ! Life was easy-in fact easiest-to me, in those periods when

it exacted the heaviest duties from me. Whoever could have seen me during

the seventy days of this autumn, when, without interruption, I did a host of

things of the highest rank- things that no man can do nowadays-with a sense

of responsibility for all the ages yet to come, would have noticed no sign of

tension in my condition, but rather a state of overflowing freshness and good

cheer. Never have I eaten with more pleasant sensations, never has my sleepbeen better. I know of no other manner of dealing with great tasks, than as

play: this, as a sign of greatness, is an essential prerequisite. The slightest

constraint, a sombre mien, any hard accent in the voice-all these things are

objections to a man, but how much more to his work ! . . . One must not have

nerves. . . . Even to suffer from solitude is an objection-the only thing I have

always suffered from is " multitude." At an absurdly tender age, in fact when

I was seven years old, I already knew that no human speech would ever reach

me : did anyone ever see me sad on that account? At present I still possess

the same affability towards everybody, I am even full of consideration for the

lowest: in all this there is not an atom of haughtiness or of secret contempt.

He whom I despise soon guesses that he is despised by me: the very fact of

my existence is enough to rouse indignation in all those who have polluted

blood in their veins. My formula for greatness in man is amor fati: the fact

that a man wishes nothing to be different, either in front of him or behind

him, or for all eternity. Not only must the necessary be borne, and on no

account concealed,-all idealism is falsehood in the face of necessity,-but it

must also be loved. . . .

            PART 3 - WHY I WRITE SUCH EXCELLENT BOOKS

  s1

  I am one thing, my creations are another. Here, before I speak of the

books themselves, I shall touch upon the question of the understanding and

misunderstanding with which they have met. I shall proceed to do this in as

perfunctory a manner as the occasion demands; for the time has by no means

come  for  this  question.  My  time  has  not  yet  come  either;  some  are  born

posthumously. One day institutions will be needed in which men will live and

teach, as I understand living and teaching; maybe, also, that by that time,

chairs will be founded and endowed for the interpretation of Zarathustra. But

I should regard it as a complete contradiction of myself, if I expected to find

ears and eyes for my truths to-day : the fact that no one listens to me, that no

one knows how to receive at my hands to-day, is not only comprehensible, it

seems to me quite the proper thing. I do not wish to be mistaken for another-

and to this end I must not mistake myself. To repeat what I have already said,

I can point to but few instances of ill-will in my life: and as for literary ill-

will, I could mention scarcely a single example of it. On the other hand, I

have met with far too much pure foolery! ... It seems to me that to take up

one of my books is one of the rarest honours that a man can pay himself-even

supposing that he put his shoes from off his feet beforehand, not to mentionboots. . . . When on one occasion Dr. Heinrich von Stein honestly complained

that he could not understand a word of my Zarathustra, I said to him that this

was just as it should be: to have understood six sentences in that book-that is

to say, to have lived them-raises a man to a higher level among mortals than "

modern" men can attain. With this feeling of distance how could I even wish

to be read by the " moderns " whom I know ! My triumph is just the opposite

of what Schopenhauer's was-I say " Non legor, non legar."-Not that I should

like to underestimate the pleasure I have derived from the innocence with

which my works have frequently been contradicted. As late as last summer,

at a time when I was attempting, perhaps by means of my weighty, all-too-

weighty literature, to throw the rest of literature off its balance, a certain

professor of Berlin University kindly gave me to understand that I ought

really to make use of a different form: no one could read such stuff as I

wrote.-Finally, it was not Germany, but Switzerland that presented me with

the two most extreme cases. An essay on Beyond Good and Evil, by Dr. V.

Widmann  in  the  paper  called  the  Bund,  under  the  heading  "  Nietzsche's

Dangerous Book," and a general account of all my works, from the pen of

Herr Karl Spitteler, also in the Bund, constitute a maximum in my life-I shall

not  say  of  what....  The  latter  treated  my  Zarathustra,  for  instance,  as

"advanced exercises in style"and expressed the wish that later on I might try

and attend to the question of substance as well; Dr. Widmann assured me of

his respect for the courage I showed in endeavouring to abolish all decent

feeling. Thanks to a little trick of destiny, every sentence in these criticisms

seemed, with a consistency that I could but admire, to be an inverted truth. In

fact it was most remarkable that all one had to do was to " transvalue all

values," in order to hit the nail on the head with regard to me, instead of

striking my head with the nail. ... I am more particularly anxious therefore to

discover an explanation. After all, no one can draw more out of things, books

included,  than  he  already  knows.  A  man  has  no  ears  for  that  to  which

experience has given him no access. To take an extreme case, suppose a book

contains simply incidents which lie quite outside the range of general or even

rare experience-suppose it to be the first language to express a whole series of

experiences. In this case nothing it contains will really be heard at all, and,

thanks  to  an  acoustic  delusion,  people  will  believe  that  where  nothing  is

heard  there  is  nothing  to  hear.  .  .  .  This,  at  least,  has  been  my  usual

experience, and proves, if you will, the originality of my experience. He who

thought he had understood something in my work, had as a rule adjustedsomething  in  it  to  his  own  image--not  infrequently  the  very  opposite  of

myself, an " idealist," for instance. He who understood nothing in my work,

would deny that I was worth considering at all.-The word "overman", which

designates a type of man that would be one of nature's rarest and luckiest

strokes, as opposed to " modern " men, to " good " men, to Christians and

other Nihilists,-a word which in the mouth of Zarathustra, the annihilator of

morality,  acquires  a  very  profound  meaning,-is  understood  almost

everywhere, and with perfect innocence, in the light of those values to which

a flat contradiction was made manifest in the figure of Zarathustra -that is to

say, as an " ideal " type, a higher kind of man, half " saint " and half" genius."

. . . Other learned cattle have suspected me of Darwinism on account of this

word  :  even  the  "  hero  cult"  of  that  great  unconscious  and  involuntary

swindler, Carlyle, -a cult which I repudiated with such roguish malice,-was

recognised in my doctrine. Once, when I whispered to a man that he would

do better to seek for the overman in a Caesar Borgia than in a Parsifal, he

could not believe his ears. The fact that I am quite free from curiosity in

regard  to  criticisms  of  my  books,  more  particularly  when  they  appear  in

newspapers, will have to be forgiven me. My friends and my publishers know

this, and never speak to me of such things. In one particular case, I once saw

all the sins that had been committed against a single book-it was Beyond

Good and Evil; I could tell you a nice story about it. Is it possible that the

National-Zeitung-a  Prussian  paper  (this  comment  is  for  the  sake  of  my

foreign readers-for my own part, I beg to state, I read only Le Journal des

Dttats)-really and seriously regarded the book as a " sign of the times," or a

genuine  and  typical  example  of  Junker  philosophy,  for  which  the  Kreuz-

Zeitung had not sufficient courage? . . .

  s2

  This was said for the benefit of Germans: for everywhere else I have my

readers-all of them exceptionally intelligent men, characters that have won

their spurs and that have been reared in high offices and superior duties ; I

have even real geniuses among my readers. In Vienna, in St. Petersburg, in

Stockholm, in Copenhagen, in Paris, and New York-I have been discovered

everywhere: I have not yet been discovered in Europe's flatland-- Germany. .

. . And, to make a confession, I rejoice much more heartily over those who do

not read me, over those who have neither heard of my name nor of the word

philosophy. But whithersoever I go, here in Turin, for instance, every face

brightens and softens at the sight of me. A thing that has flattered me morethan anything else until now, is the fact that old market-women cannot rest

until they have picked out the sweetest of their grapes for me. To this extent

must a man be a philosopher. ... It is not in vain that the Poles are considered

as  the  French  among  the  Slavs.  A  charming  Russian  lady  will  not  be

mistaken for a single moment concerning my origin. I am not successful at

being pompous, the most I can do is to appear embarrassed. ... I can think in

German, I can feel in German-I can do most things; but this is beyond my

powers.... My old master Ritschl went so far as to declare that I planned even

my philological treatises after the manner of a Parisian novelist-that I made

them absurdly thrilling. In Paris itself people are surprised at " toutes mes

audaces et finesses ";- the words are Monsieur Taine's;-I fear that even in the

highest forms of the dithyramb, that salt will be found pervading my work

which never becomes insipid, which never becomes " German "-and that is,

wit. ... I can do nought else. God help me ! Amen.-We all know, some of us

even from experience, what a " long-ears " is. Well then, I venture to assert

that I have the smallest ears that have ever been seen. This fact is not without

interest to women-it seems to me they feel that I understand them better! . . . I

am essentially the anti-ass, and on this account alone a monster in the world's

history -in Greek, and not only in Greek, I am the Antichrist.

  s3

  I am to a great extent aware of my privileges as a writer: in one or two

cases  it  has  even  been  brought  home  to  me  how  very  much  the  habitual

reading of my works " spoils " a man's taste. Other books simply cannot be

endured after mine, and least of all philosophical ones. It is an incomparable

distinction to cross the threshold of this noble and subtle world-in order to do

so one must certainly not be a German ; it is, in short, a distinction which one

must have deserved. He, however, who is related to me through loftiness of

will, experiences genuine raptures of understanding in my books: for I swoop

down from heights into which no bird has ever soared ; I know abysses into

which no foot has ever slipped. People have told me that it is impossible to

lay down a book of mine-that I disturb even the night's rest. . . . There is no

prouder or at the same time more subtle kind of books : they sometimes attain

to  the  highest  pinnacle  of  earthly  endeavour,  cynicism;  to  capture  their

thoughts a man must have the ten-derest fingers as well as the most intrepid

fists. Any kind of spiritual decrepitude utterly excludes all intercourse with

them-even any kind of dyspepsia : a man must have no nerves, but he must

have a cheerful belly. Not only the poverty of a man's soul and its stuffy airexcludes all intercourse with them, but also, and to a much greater degree,

cowardice, uncleanliness, and secret intestinal re-vengefulness ; a word from

my  lips  suffices  to  make  the  colour  of  all  evil  instincts  rush  into  a  face.

Among my acquaintances I have a number of experimental subjects, in whom

I see depicted all the different, and instructively different, reactions which

follow upon a perusal of my works. Those who will have nothing to do with

the contents of my books, as for instance my so-called friends, assume an

"impersonal" tone concerning them : they wish me luck, and congratulate me

for having produced another work ; they also declare that my writings show

progress, because they exhale a more cheerful spirit. . . . The thoroughly

vicious people, the " beautiful souls," the false from top to toe, do not know

in  the  least  what  to  do  with  my  books-  consequently,  with  the  beautiful

consistency of all beautiful souls, they regard my work as beneath them. The

cattle among my acquaintances, the mere Germans, leave me to understand, if

you please, that they are not always of my opinion, though here and there

they  agree  with  me.  ...  I  have  heard  this  said  even  about  Zarathustra.  "

Feminism,"  whether  in  mankind  or  in  man,  is  likewise  a  barrier  to  my

writings;  with  it,  no  one  could  ever  enter  into  this  labyrinth  of  fearless

knowledge. To this end, a man must never have spared himself, he must have

been hard in his habits, in order to be good-humoured and merry among a

host of inexorable truths. When I try to picture the character of a perfect

reader, I always imagine a monster of courage and curiosity, as well as of

suppleness, cunning, and prudence-in short, a born adventurer and explorer.

After all, I could not describe better than Zarathustra has done unto whom I

really address myself: unto whom alone would he reveal his riddle ? " Unto

you,  daring  explorers  and  experimenters,  and  unto  all  who  have  ever

embarked beneath cunning sails upon terrible seas ; " Unto you who revel in

riddles and in twilight, whose souls are lured by flutes unto every treacherous

abyss : " For you care not to grope your way along a thread with craven

fingers; and where you are able to guess, you hate to argue!'

  s4

  I will now pass just one or two general remarks about ray art of style. To

communicate a state an inner tension of pathos by means of signs, including

the tempo of these signs,-that is the meaning of every style; and in view of

the fact that the multiplicity of inner states in me is enormous, I am capable

of many kinds of style-in short, the most multifarious art of style that any

man  has  ever  had  at  his  disposal.  Any  style  is  good  which  genuinelycommunicates an inner condition, which does not blunder over the signs,

over the tempo of the signs, or over moods--all the laws of phrasing are the

outcome of representing moods artistically. Good style, in itself, is a piece of

sheer  foolery,  mere  idealism,  like  "  beauty  in  itself/'  for  instance,  or  "

goodness in itself," or " the thing-in-itself." All this takes for granted, of

course, that there exist ears that can hear, and such men as are capable and

worthy  of  a  like  pathos,  that  those  are  not  wanting  unto  whom  one  may

communicate one's self. Meanwhile my Zarathustra, for instance, is still in

quest of such people-alas ! he will have to seek a long while yet! A man must

be worthy of listening to him. . . . And, until that time, there will be no one

who will understand the art that has been squandered in this book. No one has

ever existed who has had more novel, more strange, and purposely created art

forms to fling to the winds. The fact that such things were possible in the

German language still awaited proof; former!)', I myself would have denied

most emphatically that it was possible. Before my time people did not know

what  could  be  done  with  the  German  language-what  could  be  done  with

language in general. The art of grand rhythm, of grand style in periods, for

expressing the tremendous fluctuations of sublime and superhuman passion,

was first discovered by me: with the dithyramb entitled " The Seven Seals,"

which constitutes the last discourse of the third part of Zarathustra, I soared

miles above all that which heretofore has been called poetry.

  s5

  The fact that the voice which speaks in my works is that of a psychologist

who has not his peer, is perhaps the first conclusion at which a good reader

will arrive-a reader such as I deserve, and one who reads me just as the good

old philologists used to read their Horace. Those propositions about which all

the world is fundamentally agreed -not to speak of fashionable philosophy, of

moralists and other empty-headed and cabbage-brained people-are to me but

ingenuous blunders : for instance, the belief that " altruistic " and " egoistic "

are  opposites,  while  all  the  time  the  "  ego  "  itself  is  merely  a  "supreme

swindle," an "ideal." . . . There are no such things as egoistic or altruistic

actions : both concepts are psychological nonsense. Or the proposition that "

man pursues happiness " ; or the proposition that "happiness is the reward of

virtue." ... Or the proposition that "pleasure and pain are opposites." . . .

Morality, the Circe of mankind, has falsified everything psychological, root

and branch -it has bemoralised everything, even to the terribly nonsensical

point of calling love "unselfish." A man must first be firmly poised, he muststand securely on his two legs, otherwise he cannot love at all. This indeed

the girls know only too well: they don't care two pins about unselfish and

merely objective men. . . . May I venture to suggest, incidentally, that I know

women? This knowledge is part of my Dionysian patrimony. Who knows ?

maybe I am the first psychologist of the eternally feminine. Women all like

me. . . . But that's an old story: save, of course, the abortions among them, the

emancipated ones, those who lack the wherewithal to have children. Thank

goodness I am not willing to let myself be torn to pieces ! the perfect woman

tears you to pieces when she loves you: I know these amiable Maenads. . . .

Oh! what a dangerous, creeping, subterranean little beast of prey she is! And

so agreeable withal! . . . A little woman, pursuing her vengeance, would force

open even the iron gates of Fate itself. Woman is incalculably more wicked

than man, she is also cleverer. Goodness in a woman is already a sign of

degeneration. All cases of " beautiful souls " in women may be traced to a

faulty physiological condition-but I go no further, lest I should become medi-

cynical. The struggle for equal rights is even a symptom of disease; every

doctor knows this. The more womanly a woman is, the more she fights tooth

and nail against rights in general: the natural order of things, the eternal war

between the sexes, assigns to her by far the foremost rank. Have people had

ears to hear my definition of love ? It is the only definition worthy of a

philosopher. Love, in its means, is war; in its foundation, it is the mortal

hatred of the sexes. Have you heard my reply to the question how a woman

can be cured, " saved " in fact?-Give her a child! A woman needs children,

man is always only a means, thus spake Zarathustra. "The emancipation of

women,"-this is the instinctive hatred of physiologically botched -that is to

say, barren-women for those of their sisters who are well constituted: the

fight against " man " is always only a means, a pretext, a piece of strategy. By

trying  to  rise  to  "  Woman  per  se,"  to  "  Higher  Woman,"  to  the  "  Ideal

Woman," all they wish to do is to lower the general level of women's rank:

and there are no more certain means to this end than university education,

trousers, and the rights of voting cattle. Truth to tell, the emancipated are the

anarchists in the " eternally feminine " world, the physiological mishaps, the

most deep-rooted instinct of whom is revenge. A whole species of the most

malicious " idealism "-which, by the bye, also manifests itself in men, in

Henrik Ibsen for instance, that typical old maid-whose object is to poison the

clean conscience, the natural spirit, of sexual love. . . . And in order to leave

no doubt in your minds in regard to my opinion, which, on this matter, is ashonest as it is severe, I will reveal to you one more clause out of my moral

code against vice-with the word " vice " I combat every kind of opposition to

Nature, or, if you prefer fine words, idealism. The clause reads: "Preaching of

chastity is a public incitement to unnatural practices. All depreciation of the

sexual life, all the sullying of it by means of the concept ' impure,' is the

essential crime against Life-is the essential crime against the Holy Spirit of

Life,"

  s6

  In order to give you some idea of myself as a psychologist, let me take

this curious piece of psychological analysis out of the book Beyond Good

and Evil, in which it appears. I forbid, by the bye, any guessing as to whom I

am  describing  in  this  passage.  "  The  genius  of  the  heart,  as  that  great

anchorite possesses it, the divine tempter and born Pied Piper of consciences,

whose voice knows how to sink into the inmost depths of every soul, who

neither utters a word nor casts a glance, in which some seductive motive or

trick does not lie : a part of whose masterliness is that he understands the art

of seeming-not what he is, but that which will place a fresh constraint upon

his followers to press ever more closely upon him, to follow him ever more

enthusiastically  and  whole-heartedly.  .  .  .  The  genius  of  the  heart,  which

makes all loud and self-conceited things hold their tongues and lend their

ears, which polishes all rough souls and makes them taste a new longing-to

lie placid as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them. . . . The

genius of the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate

and grasp more tenderly; which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure, the

pearl of goodness and sweet spirituality, beneath thick black ice, and is a

divining rod for every grain of gold, long buried and imprisoned in heaps of

mud and sand. . . . The genius of the heart, from contact with which every

man goes away richer, not ' blessed' and overcome, not as though favoured

and crushed by the good things of others ; but richer in himself, fresher to

himself than before, opened up, breathed upon and sounded by a thawing

wind ; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more bruised;

but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will and striving, full

of a new unwillingness and counter-striving." . . .

                      PART 4 - "THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY"

  s1

  In order to be fair to the Birth of Tragedy (1872) it is necessary to forget a

few  things.  It  created  a  sensation  and  even  fascinated  by  means  of  itsmistakes-by means of its application to Wagner-ism, as if the latter were the

sign of an ascending tendency. On that account alone, this treatise was an

event in Wagner's life: thenceforward great hopes surrounded the name of

Wagner. Even to this day, people remind me, sometimes in the middle of

Parsifal, that it rests on my conscience if the opinion, that this movement is of

great value to culture, at length became prevalent. I have often seen the book

quoted as " The Second Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music ": people

had ears only for new formulae for Wagner's art, his object and his mission-

and  in  this  way  the  real  hidden  value  of  the  book  was  overlooked.  "

Hellenism  and  Pessimism  "-this  would  have  been  a  less  equivocal  title,

seeing that the book contains the first attempt at showing how the Greeks

succeeded in disposing of pessimism-in what manner they overcame it. . . .

Tragedy itself is the proof of the fact that the Greeks were not pessimists:

Schopenhauer blundered here as he blundered in everything else.-Regarded

impartially, The Birth of Tragedy is a book quite strange to its age: no one

would dream that it was begun in the thunder of the battle of Worth. I thought

out these problems on cold September nights beneath the walls of Metz, in

the midst of my duties as nurse to the wounded; it would be easier to think

that it was written fifty years earlier. Its attitude towards politics is one of

indifference,-"  un-German,"  #  as  people  would  say  to-day,-it  smells

offensively of Hegel; only in one or two formulae is it infected with the bitter

odour of corpses which is peculiar to Schopenhauer. An idea-the antagonism

of the two concepts Dionysian and Apollonian -is translated into metaphysics

; history itself is depicted as the development of this idea; in tragedy this

antithesis has become unity; from this standpoint things which theretofore

had never been face to face are suddenly confronted, and understood and

illuminated by each other. . . . Opera and revolution, for instance. . . . The two

decisive  innovations  in  the  book  are,  first,  the  comprehension  of  the

Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks-it provides the first psychological

analysis of this phenomenon, and sees in it the single root of all Greek art;

and, secondly, the comprehension of Socraticism-Socrates being presented

for the first time as the instrument of Greek dissolution, as a typical decadent.

"  Reason"  versus  Instinct.  "  Reason  "  at  any  cost,  as  a  dangerous,  life-

undermining  force.  The  whole  book  is  profoundly  and  politely  silent

concerning  Christianity:  the  latter  is  neither  Apollonian  nor  Dionysian;  it

denies  all  aesthetic  values,  which  are  the  only  values  that  The  Birth  of

Tragedy recognises. Christianity is most profoundly nihilistic, whereas in theDionysian symbol, the most extreme limits of a yea-saying attitude to life are

attained. In one part of the book the Christian priesthood is referred to as a "

perfidious order of goblins," as " subterraneans."

  s2

  This start of mine was remarkable beyond measure. As a confirmation of

my inmost personal experience I had discovered the only example of this fact

that history possesses,-with this I was the first to understand the amazing

Dionysian  phenomenon.  At  the  same  time,  by  recognising  Socrates  as  a

decadent, I proved most conclusively that the certainty of my psychological

grasp  of  things  ran  very  little  risk  at  the  hands  of  any  sort  of  moral

idiosyncrasy: to regard morality itself as a symptom of degeneration is an

innovation, a unique event of the first order in the history of knowledge. How

high  I  had  soared  above  the  pitifully  foolish  gabble  about  Optimism  and

Pessimism  with  my  two  new  doctrines!  I  was  the  first  to  see  the  actual

contrast: the degenerate instinct which turns upon life with a subterranean

lust  of  vengeance  (Christianity,  WHY  I  WRITE  SUCH  EXCELLENT

BOOKS 71

    Schopenhauer's  philosophy,  and  in  some  respects  too  even  Plato's

philosophy-in short, the whole of idealism in its typical forms), as opposed to

a  formula  of  the  highest  yea-saying  to  life,  born  of  an  abundance  and  a

superabundance of life-a yea-saying free from all reserve, applying even to

suffering, and guilt, and all that is questionable and strange in existence. . . .

This last, most joyous, most exuberant and exultant yea to life, is not only the

highest, but also the profoundest conception, and one which is most strictly

confirmed and supported by truth and science. Nothing that exists must be

suppressed,  nothing  can  be  dispensed  with.  Those  aspects  of  life  which

Christians and other Nihilists reject, belong to an incalculably higher order in

the hierarchy of values, than that which the instinct of degeneration calls

good, and may call good. In order to understand this, a certain courage is

necessary, and, as a prerequisite of this, a certain superfluity of strength : for

a man can approach only as near to truth as he has the courage to advance-

that is to say, everything depends strictly upon the measure of his strength.

Knowledge, and the affirmation of reality, are just as necessary to the strong

man as cowardice, the flight from reality-in fact, the "ideal"-are necessary to

the weak inspired by weakness. . . . These people are not at liberty to "know,"

-decadents stand in need of lies,-it is one of their self-preservative measures.

He  who  not  only  understands  the  word  "  Dionysian,"  but  understandshimself"in  that  term,  does  not  require  any  refutation  of  Plato,  or  of

Christianity, or of Schopenhauer-for his nose scents decomposition.

  s3

  The extent to which I had by means of these doctrines discovered the idea

of " tragedy," the ultimate explanation of what the psychology of tragedy is, I

discussed finally in The Twilight of the Idols (Aph. 5, part I o). . . . " The

saying of yea to life, and even to its weirdest and most difficult problems :

the  will  to  life  rejoicing  at  its  own  infinite  vitality  in  the  sacrifice  of  its

highest types-that is what I called Dionysian, that is what I meant as the

bridge to the psychology of the tragic poet. Not to cast out terror and pity, or

to purge one's self of dangerous passion by discharging it with vehemence,-

this was Aristotle's * misunderstanding of it,-but to be far beyond terror and

pity and to be the eternal lust of Becoming itself-that lust which also involves

the joy of destruction." ... In this sense I have the right to regard myself as the

first  tragic  philosopher-that  is  to  say,  the  most  extreme  antithesis  and

antipodes of a pessimistic philosopher. Before my time no such thing existed

as this translation of the Dionysian phenomenon into philosophic emotion :

tragic wisdom was lacking ; in vain have I sought for signs of it even among

the great Greeks in philosophy-those belonging to the two centuries before

Socrates.  I  still  remained  a  little  doubtful  about  Heraclitus,  in  whose

presence, alone, I felt warmer and more at ease than anywhere else. The yea-

saying to the impermanence and annihilation of things, which is the decisive

feature of a Dionysian philosophy; the. yea-saying to contradiction and war,

the postulation of Becoming, together with the radical rejection even of the

concept Being- in all these things, at all events, I must recognise him who has

come  nearest  to  me  in  thought  hither  to.  The  doctrine  of  the  "  Eternal

Recurrence "- that is to say, of the absolute and eternal repetition of all things

in periodical cycles-this doctrine of Zarathustra's might, it is true, have been

taught  before.  In  any  case,  the  Stoics,  who  derived  nearly  all  their

fundamental ideas from Heraclitus, show traces of it.

  s4

  A  tremendous  hope  finds  expression  in  this  work.  After  all,  I  have

absolutely no reason to renounce the hope for a Dionysian future of music.

Let us look a century ahead, and let us suppose that my attempt to destroy

two millenniums of hostility to Nature and of the violation of humanity be

crowned with success. That new party of life-advocates, which will undertake

the greatest of all tasks, the elevation and perfection of mankind, as well asthe relentless destruction of all degenerate and parasitical elements, will make

that superabundance of life on earth once more possible, out of which the

Dionysian state will perforce arise again. I promise the advent of a tragic age:

the highest art in the saying of yea to life, " tragedy," will be born again when

mankind  has  the  knowledge  of  the  hardest,  but  most  necessary  of  wars,

behind  it,  without,  however,  suffering  from  that  knowledge.  .  .  .  A

psychologist might add that what I heard in Wagnerian music in my youth

and early manhood had nothing whatsoever to do with Wagner; that when I

described Dionysian music, I described merely what / personally had heard-

that I was compelled instinctively to translate and transfigure everything into

the new spirit which filled my breast. A proof of this, and as strong a proof as

you  could  have,  is  my  essay,  Wagner  in  Bayreuth:  in  all  its  decisive

psychological  passages  I  am  the  only  person  concerned-without  any

hesitation you may read my name or the word " Zarathustra " wherever the

text contains the name of Wagner. The whole panorama of the dithyrambic

artist is the representation of the already existing author of Zarathustra, and it

is drawn with an abysmal depth which does not even once come into contact

with the real Wagner. Wagner himself had a notion of the truth ; he did not

recognise  himself  in  the  essay.-In  this  way,  "the  idea  of  Bayreuth"  was

changed  into  something  which  to  those  who  are  acquainted  with  my

Zarathustra will be no riddle-that is to say, into the Great Noon when the

highest of the elect will consecrate themselves for the greatest of all duties-

who knows? the vision of a feast which I may live to see. . . . The pathos of

the first few pages is universal history ; the look which is discussed on page

105* of the book, is the actual look of Zarathustra; Wagner, Bayreuth, the

whole of this petty German wretchedness, is a cloud upon which an infinite

Fata  Morgana  of  the  future  is  reflected.  Even  from  the  psychological

standpoint, all the decisive traits in my character are introduced into Wagner's

nature -the juxtaposition of the most brilliant and most fatal forces, a Will to

Power  such  as  no  man  has  ever  possessed-inexorable  bravery  in  matters

spiritual,  an  unlimited  power  of  learning  unaccompanied  by  depressed

powers for action. Everything in this essay is a prophecy: the proximity of the

resurrection  of  the  Greek  spirit,  the  need  of  men  who  will  be  counter-

Alexanders, who will once more tie the Gordian knot of Greek culture, after

it has been cut. Listen to the world-historic accent with which the concept "

sense for the tragic " is introduced on page 180: there are little else but world-

historic accents in this essay. This is the strangest kind of " objectivity " thatever existed : my absolute certainty in regard to what I am, projected itself

into  any  chance  reality-truth  about  myself  was  voiced  from  out  appalling

depths. On pages 174

  and 175

  the style of Zarathustra is described and foretold with incisive certainty,

and no more magnificent expression will ever he found than that on pages

144-147

  for  the  event  for  which  Zarathustra  stands  -that  prodigious  act  of  the

purification and consecration of mankind.

                    PART 5 - "THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON"

  s1

  The four essays composing the Thoughts out of Season are thoroughly

warlike in tone. They prove that I was no mere dreamer, that I delight in

drawing the sword-and perhaps, also, that my wrist is dangerously supple.

The first onslaught (1873) was directed against German culture, upon which I

looked down even at that time with unmitigated contempt. Without either

sense, substance, or goal, it was simply " public opinion." There could be no

more dangerous misunderstanding than to suppose that Germany's success at

arms proved anything in favour of German culture-and still less the triumph

of this culture over that of France. The second essay (1874) brings to light

that which is dangerous, that which corrodes and poisons life in our manner

of pursuing scientific study : Life is diseased, thanks to this dehumanised

piece of clockwork and mechanism, thanks to the " impersonality" of the

workman, and the false economy of the " division of labour." The object,

which is culture, is lost sight of: modern scientific activity as a means thereto

simply produces barbarism. In this treatise, the " historical sense," of which

this century is so proud, is for the first time recognised as sickness, as a

typical symptom of decay. In the third and fourth essays, a sign-post is set up

pointing to a higher concept of culture, to a re-establishment of the notion "

culture " ; and two pictures of the hardest self-love and self-discipline are

presented,  two  essentially  un-modern  types,  full  of  the  most  sovereign

contempt for all that which lay around them and was called " Empire," "

Culture," " Christianity," " Bismarck," and " Success," - these two types were

Schopenhauer and Wagner, or, in a word, Nietzsche. . . .

  s2

  Of these four attacks, the first met with extraordinary success. The stir

which it created was in every way gorgeous. I had put my finger on thevulnerable spot of a triumphant nation-I had told it that its victory was not a

red-letter day for culture, but, perhaps, something very different. The reply

rang out from all sides, and certainly not only from old friends of David

Strauss, whom I had made ridiculous as the type of a German Philistine of

Culture  and  a  man  of  smug  self-content-in  short,  as  the  author  of  that

suburban  gospel  of  his,  called  The  Old  and  the  New  Faith  (the  term  "

Philistine of Culture" passed into the current language of Germany after the

appearance of my book). These old friends, whose vanity as Wiirtembergians

and Swabians I had deeply wounded in regarding their unique animal, their

bird of Paradise, as a trifle comic, replied to me as ingenuously and as grossly

as I could have wished. The Prussian replies were smarter; they contained

more  "Prussian  blue."  The  most  disreputable  attitude  was  assumed  by  a

Leipzig  paper,  the  egregious  Grentzboten;  and  it  cost  me  some  pains  to

prevent my indignant friends in Bale from taking action against it. Only a few

old gentlemen decided in my favour, and for very diverse and sometimes

unaccountable  reasons.  Among  them  was  one,  Ewald  of  Gottingen,  who

made it clear that my attack on Strauss had been deadly. There was also the

Hegelian, Bruno Bauer, who from that time became one of my most attentive

readers. In his later years he liked to refer to me, when, for instance, he

wanted to give Herr von Treitschke, the Prussian Historiographer, a hint as to

where he could obtain information about the notion " Culture," of which he

(Herr von T.) had completely lost sight. The weightiest and longest notice of

my book and its author appeared in Wiirzburg, and was written by Professor

Hoffmann, an old pupil of the philosopher von Baader. The essays made him

foresee a great future for me, namely, that of bringing about a sort of crisis

and decisive turning-point in the problem of atheism, of which he recognised

in me the most instinctive and most radical advocate. It was atheism that had

drawn  me  to  Schopenhauer.  The  review  which  received  by  far  the  most

attention,  and  which  excited  the  most  bitterness,  was  an  extraordinarily

powerful and plucky appreciation of my work by Carl Hillebrand, a man who

was usually so mild, and the last humane German who knew how to wield a

pen. The article appeared in the Augsburg Gazette, and it can be read to-day,

couched in rather more cautious language, among his collected essays. In it

my work was referred to as an event, as a decisive turning-point, as the first

sign of an awakening, as an excellent symptom, and as an actual revival of

German earnestness and of German passion in things spiritual. Hillebrand

could speak only in the terms of the highest respect, of the form of my book,of its consummate taste, of its perfect tact in discriminating between persons

and causes : he characterised it as the best polemical work in the German

language,-the best performance in the art of polemics, which for Germans is

so  dangerous  and  so  strongly  to  be  deprecated.  Besides  confirming  my

standpoint, he laid even greater stress upon what I had dared to say about the

deterioration of language in Germany (nowadays writers assume the airs of

Purists * and can no longer even construct a sentence) ; sharing my contempt

for the literary stars of this nation, he concluded by expressing his admiration

for  my  courage  -  that  "  greatest  courage  of  all  which  places  the  very

favourites of the people in the dock." . . . The after-effects of this essay of

mine proved invaluable to me in my life. No one has ever tried to meddle

with  me  since.  People  are  silent.  In  Germany  I  am  treated  with  gloomy

caution: for years I have rejoiced in the privilege of such absolute freedom of

speech, as no one nowadays, least of all in the " Empire," has enough liberty

to claim. My paradise is " in the shadow of my sword." At bottom all I had

done was to put one of Stendhal's maxims into practice: he advises one to

make one's entrance into society by means of a duel. And how well I had

chosen my opponent!-the foremost free-thinker of Germany. As a matter of

fact, quite a novel kind of free thought found its expression in this way: up to

the present nothing has been more strange and more foreign to my blood than

the whole of that European and American species known as libres penseurs.

Incorrigible blockheads and clowns of " modern ideas " that they are, I feel

much  more  profoundly  at  variance  with  them  than  with  anyone  of  their

adversaries. They also wish to " improve " mankind, after their own fashion-

that is to say, in their own image; against that which I stand for and desire,

they would wage an implacable war, if only they understood it; the whole

gang of them still believe in an " ideal." ... I am the first Immoralist.

  s3

  I should not like to say that the last two essays in the Thoughts out of

Season, associated with the names of Schopenhauer and Wagner respectively,

serve  any  special  purpose  in  throwing  light  upon  these  two  cases,  or  in

formulating their psychological problems. This of course does not apply to a

few  details.  Thus,  for  instance,  in  the  second  of  the  two  essays,  with  a

profound certainty of instinct I already characterised the elementary factor in

Wagner's nature as a theatrical talent which in all his means and inspirations

only draws its final conclusions. At bottom, my desire in this essay was to do

something  very  different  from  writing  psychology:  an  unprecedentededucational problem, a new understanding of self-discipline and self-defence

carried to the point of hardness, a road to greatness and to world-historic

duties, yearned to find expression. Roughly speaking, I seized two famous

and,  theretofore,  completely  undefined  types  by  the  forelock,  after  the

manner in which one seizes opportunities, simply in order to speak my mind

on certain questions, in order to have a few more formulas, signs, and means

of  expression  at  my  disposal.  Indeed  I  actually  suggest  this,  with  most

unearthly sagacity, on page 183

  of Schopenhauer as Educator. Plato made use of Socrates in the same

way-that is to say, as a cipher for Plato. Now that, from some distance, I can

look back upon the conditions of which these essays are the testimony, I

would be loth to deny that they refer simply to me. The essay Wagner in

Bayreuth is a vision of my own future; on the other hand, my most secret

history, my development, is written down in Schopenhauer as Educator. But,

above all, the vow I made! What I am today, the place I now hold-at a height

from which I speak no longer with words but with thunderbolts -oh, how far I

was from all this in those days! But I saw the land-I did not deceive myself

for one moment as to the way, the sea, the danger- and success ! The great

calm in promising, this happy prospect of a future which must not remain

only a promise !-In this book every word has been lived, profoundly and

intimately; the most painful things are not lacking in it; it contains words

which are positively running with blood. But a wind of great freedom blows

over the whole; even its wounds do not constitute an objection. As to what I

understand by being a philosopher,-that is to say, a terrible explosive in the

presence of which everything is in danger; as to how I sever my idea of the

philosopher by miles from that other idea of him which includes even a Kant,

not  to  speak  of  the  academic  "  ruminators  "  and  other  professors  of

philosophy,-concerning  all  these  things  this  essay  provides  invaluable

information,  even  granting  that  at  bottom,  it  is  not  "  Schopenhauer  as

Educator " but " Nietzsche as Educator," who speaks his sentiments in it.

Considering that, in those days, my trade was that of a scholar, and perhaps,

also,  that  I  understood  my  trade,  the  piece  of  austere  scholar  psychology

which suddenly makes its appearance in this essay is not without importance:

it expresses the feeling of distance, and my profound certainty regarding what

was my real life-task, and what were merely means, intervals, and accessory

work to me. My wisdom consists in my having been many things, and in

many places, in order to become one thing-in order to be able to attain to onething. It was part of my fate to be a scholar for a while.

                    PART 6 - "HUMAN, ALL-TOO-HUMAN"

  s1

  Human, all-too-Human, with its two sequels, is the memorial of a crisis.

It is called a book for free spirits: almost every sentence in it is the expression

of a triumph-by means of it I purged myself of everything in me which was

foreign to my nature. Idealism is foreign to me : the title of the book means:

"Where you see ideal things I see- human, alas ! all-too-human things ! " . . .

I  know  men  better.  The  word  "  free  spirit"  in  this  book  must  not  be

understood as anything else than a spirit that has become free, that has once

more  taken  possession  of  itself.  My  tone,  the  pitch  of  my  voice,  has

completely changed; the book will be thought clever, cool, and at times both

hard and scornful. A certain spirituality, of noble taste, seems to be ever

struggling to dominate a passionate torrent at its feet. In this respect there is

some sense in the fact that it was the hundredth anniversary of Voltaire's

death that served, so to speak, as an excuse for the publication of the book as

early as 1878. For Voltaire, as the opposite of everyone who wrote after him,

was above all a grandee of the intellect: precisely what I am also. The name

of  Voltaire  on  one  of  my  writings-that  was  verily  a  step  forward  -in  my

direction. . . . Looking into this book a little more closely, you perceive a

pitiless spirit who knows all the secret hiding-places in which ideals are wont

to skulk-where they find their dungeons, and, as it were, their last refuge.

With a torch in my hand, the light of which is not by any means a flickering

one, I illuminate this nether world with beams that cut like blades. It is war,

but war without powder and smoke, without warlike attitudes, without pathos

and contorted limbs-all these things would still be "idealism." One error after

the other is quietly laid upon ice; the ideal is not refuted -it freezes. Here, for

instance, "genius" freezes; round the corner the " saint " freezes ; under a

thick icicle the " hero " freezes; and in the end " faith " itself freezes. So-

called"conviction"and  also  "pity"  are  considerably  cooled-and  almost

everywhere the "thing in itself" is freezing to death.

  s2

  This  book  was  begun  during  the  first  musical  festival  at  Bayreuth;  a

feeling of profound strangeness towards everything that surrounded me there,

is one of its first conditions. He who has any notion of the visions which even

at that time had flitted across my path, will be able to guess what I felt when

one  day  I  came  to  my  senses  in  Bayreuth.  It  was  just  as  if  I  had  beendreaming. Where on earth was I ? I recognised nothing that I saw; I scarcely

recognised Wagner. It was in vain that I called up reminiscences. Tribschen-

remote island of bliss : not the shadow of a resemblance ! The incomparable

days devoted to the laying of the first stone, the small group of the initiated

who celebrated them, and who were far from lacking fingers for the handling

of delicate things : not the shadow of a resemblance ! What had happened?-

Wagner had been translated into German! The Wagnerite had become master

of Wagner! - Gentian art! the German master! German beer! . . . We who

know only too well the kind of refined artists and cosmopolitanism in taste,

to which alone Wagner's art can appeal, were beside ourselves at the sight of

Wagner bedecked with German virtues. I think I know the Wagnerite, I have

experienced  three  generations  of  them,  from  Brendel  of  blessed  memory,

who confounded Wagner with Hegel, to the " idealists " of the Bayreuth

Gazette, who confound Wagner with themselves,-I have been the recipient of

every kind of confession about Wagner, from " beautiful souls." My kingdom

for just one intelligent word!-In very truth, a blood-curdling company! Nohl,

Pohl, and Kohl* and others of their kidney to infinity! There was not a single

abortion  that  was  lacking  among  them-no,  not  even  the  anti-Semite.-Poor

Wagner! Into whose hands had he fallen ? If only he had gone into a herd of

swine ! But among Germans ! Some day, for the edification of posterity, one

ought really to have a genuine Bayreuthian stuffed, or, better still, preserved

in  spirit,-for  it  is  precisely  spirit  that  is  lacking  in  this  quarter,-with  this

inscription  at  the  foot  of  the  jar:  "  A  sample  of  the  spirit  whereon  the  '

German  Empire'  was  founded."  .  .  .  But  enough  !  In  the  middle  of  the

festivities I suddenly packed my trunk and left the place for a few weeks,

despite  the  fact  that  a  charming  Parisian  lady  sought  to  comfort  me  ;  I

excused myself to Wagner simply by means of a fatalistic telegram. In a little

spot called Klingenbrunn, deeply buried in the recesses of the Bohmerwald, I

carried my melancholy and my contempt of Germans about with me like an

illness-and, from time to time, under the general title of " The Ploughshare," I

wrote  a  sentence  or  two  down  in  my  notebook,  nothing  but  severe

psychological stuff, which it is possible may have found its way into Human,

all-too-Human.

  s3

  That  which  had  taken  place  in  me,  then,  was  not  only  a  breach  with

Wagner-I was suffering from a general aberration of my instincts, of which a

mere isolated blunder, whether it were Wagner or my professorship at Bale,was nothing more than a symptom. I was seized with a fit of impatience with

myself; I saw that it was high time that I should turn my thoughts upon my

own lot. In a trice I realised, with appalling clearness, how much time had

already been squandered-how futile and how senseless my whole existence as

a philologist appeared by the side of my life-task. I was ashamed of this false

modesty. . . . Ten years were behind me, during which, to tell the truth, the

nourishment of my spirit had been at a standstill, during which I had added

not a single useful fragment to my knowledge, and had forgotten countless

things in the pursuit of a hodge-podge of dry-as-dust scholarship. To crawl

with meticulous care and short-sighted eyes through old Greek metricians-

that is what I had come to! ... Moved to pity I saw myself quite thin, quite

emaciated:  realities  were  only  too  plainly  absent  from  my  stock  of

knowledge, and what the " idealities " were worth the devil alone knew ! A

positively burning thirst overcame me: and from that time forward I have

done  literally  nothing  else  than  study  physiology,  medicine,  and  natural

science -I even returned to the actual study of history only when my life-task

compelled me to. It was at that time, too, that I first divined the relation

between an instinctively repulsive occupation, a so-called vocation, which is

the last thing to which one is " called," and that need of lulling a feeling of

emptiness and hunger, by means of an art which is a narcotic-by means of

Wagner's  art,  for  instance.  After  looking  carefully  about  me,  I  have

discovered that a large number of young men are all in the same state of

distress:  one  kind  of  unnatural  practice  perforce  leads  to  another.  In

Germany, or rather, to avoid all ambiguity, in the Empire,* only too many are

condemned to determine their choice too soon, and then to pine away beneath

a burden that they can no longer throw off. . . . Such creatures crave for

Wagner as for an opiate,-they are thus able to forget themselves, to be rid of

themselves for a moment. . . . What am I saying !-for five or six hours.

  s4

  At this time my instincts turned resolutely against any further yielding or

following on my part, and any further misunderstanding of myself. Every

kind of life, the most unfavourable circumstances, illness, poverty-anything

seemed to me preferable to that undignified " selfishness " into which I had

fallen; in the first place, thanks to my ignorance and youth, and in which I

had afterwards remained owing to laziness-the so-called " sense of duty." At

this  juncture  there  came  to  my  help,  in  a  way  that  I  cannot  sufficiently

admire, and precisely at the right time, that evil heritage which I derive frommy  father's  side  of  the  family,  and  which,  at  bottom,  is  no  more  than  a

predisposition  to  die  young.  Illness  slowly  liberated  me  from  the  toils,  it

spared me any sort of sudden breach, any sort of violent and offensive step.

At that time I lost not a particle of the good will of others, but rather added to

my store. Illness likewise gave me the right completely to reverse my mode

of life ; it not only allowed, it actually commanded, me to forget; it bestowed

upon me the necessity of lying still, of having leisure, of waiting, and of

exercising patience. . . . But all this means thinking! . . . The state of my eyes

alone put an end to all book-wormishness, or, in plain English-philology: I

was thus delivered from books ; for years I ceased from reading, and this was

the greatest boon I ever conferred upon myself! That nethermost self, which

was, as it were, entombed, and which had grown dumb because it had been

forced to listen perpetually to other selves (for that is what reading means!),

slowly awakened ; at first it was shy and doubtful, but at last it spoke again.

Never have I rejoiced more over my condition than during the sickest and

most painful moments of my life. You have only to examine The Dawn of

Day, or, perhaps, The Wanderer and his Shadow* in order to understand what

this "return to myself" actually meant: in itself it was the highest kind of

recovery ! . . . My cure was simply the result of it.

  s5

  Human,  all-too-Human,  this  monument  of  a  course  of  vigorous  self-

discipline,  by  means  of  which  I  put  an  abrupt  end  to  all  the  "  Superior

Bunkum," " Idealism," " Beautiful Feelings," and other effeminacies that had

percolated into my being, was written principally in Sorrento ; it was finished

and given definite shape during a winter at Bale, under conditions far less

favourable than those in Sorrento. Truth to tell, it was Peter Gast, at that time

a student at the University of Bale, and a devoted friend of mine, who was

responsible for the book. With my head wrapped in bandages, and extremely

painful,  I  dictated  while  he  wrote  and  corrected  as  he  went  along-to  be

accurate, he was the real composer, whereas I was only the author. When the

completed book ultimately reached me,-to the great surprise of the serious

invalid I then was, -I sent, among others, two copies to Bayreuth. Thanks to a

miraculous  flash  of  intelligence  on  the  part  of  chance,  there  reached  me

precisely  at  the  same  time  a  splendid  copy  of  the  Parsifal  text,  with  the

following  inscription  from  Wagner's  pen:  "  To  his  dear  friend  Friedrich

Nietzsche, from Richard Wagner, Ecclesiastical Councillor." At this crossing

of the two books I seemed to hear an ominous note. Did it not sound as if twoswords had crossed ? At all events we both felt this was so, for each of us

remained silent. At about this time the first Bayreuth Pamphlets appeared:

and  I  then  understood  the  move  on  my  part  for  which  it  was  high  time.

Incredible! Wagner had become pious.

  s6

  My attitude to myself at that time (1876), and the unearthly certitude with

which I grasped my life-task and all its world-historic consequences, is well

revealed throughout the book, but more particularly in one very significant

passage,  despite  the  fact  that,  with  my  instinctive  cunning,  I  once  more

circumvented the use of the little word " I," -not however, this time, in order

to shed world-historic glory on the names of Schopenhauer and Wagner, but

on that of another of my friends, the excellent Dr. Paul Ree-fortunately much

too  acute  a  creature  to  be  deceived-others  were  less  subtle.  Among  my

readers I have a number of hopeless people, the typical German professor for

instance, who can always be recognised from the fact that, judging from the

passage in question, he feels compelled to regard the whole book as a sort of

superior Re"ealism. As a matter of fact it contradicts five or six of my friend's

utterances:  only  read  the  introduction  to  The  orals  on  this  question.-The

passage above referred to reads: " What, after all, is the principal axiom to

which the boldest and coldest thinker, the author of the book On the Origin of

Moral  Sensations"  (read  Nietzsche,  the  first  Immoralist),"  has  attained  by

means of his incisive and decisive analysis of human actions ? ' The moral

man,' he says,' is no nearer to the intelligible (metaphysical) world than is the

physical man, for there is no intelligible world.' This theory, hardened and

sharpened  under  the  hammer-blow  of  historical  knowledge  "(read  The

Transvaluation of all Values), " may some time or other, perhaps in some

future period,-1890!- serve as the axe which is applied to the root of the '

metaphysical need' of man,-whether more as a blessing than a curse to the

general welfare it is not easy to say; but in any case as a theory with the most

important consequences, at once fruitful and terrible, and looking into the

world with that Janus-face which all great knowledge possesses."

        PART 7 - "THE DAWN OF DAY" Thoughts about Morality as a

                                        Prejudice

  s1

  With this book I open my campaign against morality. Not that it is at all

redolent of powder- you will find quite other and much nicer smells in it,

provided that you have any keenness in your nostrils. There is nothing eitherof light or of heavy artillery in its composition, and if its general end be a

negative one, its means are not so-means out of which the end follows like a

logical conclusion, not like a cannon-shot. And if the reader takes leave of

this book with a feeling of timid caution in regard to everything which has

until now been honoured and even worshipped under the name of morality, it

does not alter the fact that there is not one negative word, not one attack, and

not one single piece of malice in the whole work-on the contrary, it lies in the

sunshine,  smooth  and  happy,  like  a  marine  animal,  basking  in  the  sun

between two rocks. For, after all, I was this marine animal: almost every

sentence in the book was thought out, or rather caught, among that medley of

rocks  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Genoa,  where  I  lived  quite  alone,  and

exchanged secrets with the ocean. Even to this day, when by chance I happen

to turn over the leaves of this book, almost every sentence seems to me like a

hook by means of which I draw something incomparable out of the depths ;

its whole skin quivers with delicate shudders of recollection. This book is

conspicuous for no little art in gently catching things which whisk rapidly

and silently away, moments which I call godlike lizards-not with the cruelty

of  that  young  Greek  god  who  simply  transfixed  the  poor  little  beast;  but

nevertheless with something pointed -with a pen. " There are so many dawns

which have not yet shed their light"-this Indian maxim is written over the

doorway of this book. Where does its author seek that new morning, that

delicate red, as yet undiscovered, with which another day-ah! a whole series

of days, a whole world of new days !- will begin ? In the Transvaluation of

all Values, in an emancipation from all moral values, in a saying of yea, and

in  an  attitude  of  trust,  to  all  that  which  until  now  has  been  forbidden,

despised, and damned. This yea-saying book projects its light, its love, its

tenderness,  over  all  evil  things,  it  restores  to  them  their  soul,  their  clear

conscience, and their superior right and privilege to exist on earth. Morality is

not assailed, it simply ceases to be considered. This book closes with the

word " or ? " -it is the only book which closes with an " or ?".

  s2

  My life-task is to prepare for humanity one supreme moment in which it

can come to its senses, a Great Noon in which it will turn its gaze backwards

and forwards, in which it will step from under the yoke of accident and of

priests, and for the first time set the question of the Why and Wherefore of

humanity as a whole-this life-task naturally follows out of the conviction that

mankind does not get on the right road of its own accord, that it is by nomeans divinely ruled, but rather that it is precisely under the cover of its most

holy  valuations  that  the  instinct  of  negation,  of  corruption,  and  of

degeneration has held such a seductive sway. The question concerning the

origin of moral valuations is therefore a matter of the highest importance to

me because it determines the future of mankind. The demand made upon us

to believe that everything is really in the best hands, that a certain book, the

Bible,  gives  us  the  definite  and  comforting  assurance  that  there  is  a

Providence that wisely rules the fate of man,-when translated back into reality

amounts simply to this, namely, the will to stifle the truth which maintains

the reverse of all this, which is that until now man has been in the worst

possible  hands,  and  that  he  has  been  governed  by  the  physiologically

botched, the men of cunning and burning revengefulness, and the so-called "

saints " -those slanderers of the world and traducers of humanity. The definite

proof  of  the  fact  that  the  priest  (including  the  priest  in  disguise,  the

philosopher) has become master, not only within a certain limited religious

community, but everywhere, and that the morality of decadence, the will to

nonentity, has become morality per se, is to be found in this: that altruism is

now an absolute value, and egoism is regarded with hostility everywhere. He

who disagrees with me on this point, I regard as infected. But all the world

disagrees  with  me.  To  a  physiologist  a  like  antagonism  between  values

admits of no doubt. If the most insignificant organ within the body neglects,

however  slightly,  to  assert  with  absolute  certainty  its  self-preservative

powers,  its  recuperative  claims,  and  its  egoism,  the  whole  system

degenerates. The physiologist insists upon the removal of degenerated parts,

he denies all fellow-feeling for such parts, and has not the smallest feeling of

pity for them. But the desire of the priest is precisely the degeneration of the

whole of mankind ; hence his preservation of that which is degenerate-this is

what his dominion costs humanity. What meaning have those lying concepts,

those handmaids of morality," Soul," " Spirit," " Free will," " God," if their

aim is not the physiological ruin of mankind ? When earnestness is diverted

from  the  instincts  that  aim  at  self-preservation  and  an  increase  of  bodily

energy, i.e. at an increase of life; when anaemia is raised to an ideal and the

contempt of the body is construed as " the salvation of the soul," what is all

this if it is not a recipe for decadence ? Loss of ballast, resistance offered to

natural instincts, selflessness, in fact-this is what has until now been known

as morality. With The Dawn of Day I first engaged in a struggle against the

morality of self-renunciation.                PART 8 - "THE GAY SCIENCE" La Gaya Scienza

  s1

  Dawn of Day is a yea-saying book, profound, but clear and kindly. The

same applies once more and in the highest degree to La Gaya Scienza : in

almost  every  sentence  of  this  book,  profundity  and  playfulness  go  gently

hand in hand. A verse which expresses my gratitude for the most wonderful

month  of  January  which  I  have  ever  lived-  the  whole  book  is  a  gift-

sufficiently  reveals  the  abysmal  depths  from  which  "  wisdom"  has  here

become joyful. " You who with cleaving fiery lances The stream of my soul

from its ice do free, Till with a rush and a roar it advances To enter with

glorious hoping the sea: Brighter to see and purer ever, Free in the bonds of

your sweet constraint,- So it praises your wondrous endeavour, January, you

beauteous saint!"* Who can be in any doubt as to what " glorious hoping"

means  here,  when  he  has  realised  the  diamond  beauty  of  the  first  of

Zarathustra's words as they appear in a glow of light at the close of the fourth

book ? Or when he reads the granite sentences at the end of the third book,

wherein a fate for all times is first given a formula ? The songs of Prince

Free-as-a-Bird, which, for the most part, were written in Sicily, remind me

quite forcibly of that Provengal notion of " Gaya Scienza" of that union of

singer,  knight,  and  free  spirit,  which  distinguishes  that  wonderfully  early

culture of the Provencals from all ambiguous cultures. The last poem of all,"

To the Mistral,"-an exuberant dance song in which, if you please, the new

spirit dances freely upon the corpse of morality,-is a perfect Provencalism.

  PART 9 - "THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA" A Book for All and None "

  s1

  I now wish to relate the history of Zarathustra, The fundamental idea of

the work, the Eternal Recurrence, the highest formula of a Yea-saying to life

that can ever be attained, was first conceived in the month of August 1881. I

made  a  note  of  the  idea  on  a  sheet  of  paper,  with  the  postscript:  "  Six

thousand feet beyond man and time." That day I happened to be wandering

through the woods alongside of the Lake of Silvaplana, and I halted not far

from Surlei, beside a huge rock that towered aloft like a pyramid. It was then

that the thought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two months

before this inspiration I had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden

and decisive change in my tastes-more particularly in music. The whole of

Zarathustra might perhaps be classified under the rubric music. At all events,

the essential condition of its production was a second birth within me of theart of hearing. In Recoaro, a small mountain resort near Vicenza, where I

spent the spring of 1881, I and my friend and maestro, Peter Gast-who was

also  one  who  had  been  born  again,  discovered  that  the  phoenix  music

hovered over us, in lighter and brighter plumage than it had ever worn before.

If, therefore, I now calculate from that day forward the sudden production of

the book, under the most unlikely circumstances, in February 1883, -the last

part, out of which I quoted a few lines in my preface, was written precisely in

the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice,-I come

to the conclusion that the period of gestation covered eighteen months. This

period of exactly eighteen months, might suggest, at least to Buddhists, that 1

  am in reality a female elephant. The interval was devoted to the Gaya

Scienza,  which  contains  hundreds  of  indications  of  the  proximity  of

something unparalleled ; for, after all, it shows the beginning of Zarathustra,

since it presents Zarathustrds fundamental thought in the last aphorism but

one of the fourth book. To this interval also belongs that Hymn to Life (for a

mixed choir and orchestra), the score of which was published in Leipzig two

years ago by E. W. Fritsch, and which gave perhaps no slight indication of

my spiritual state during this year, in which the essentially yea-saying pathos,

which I call the tragic pathos, completely filled me heart and limb. One day

people will sing it to my memory. The text, let it be well understood, as there

is  some  misunderstanding  abroad  on  this  point,  is  not  by  me;  it  was  the

astounding inspiration of a young Russian lady, Miss Lou von Salome, with

whom I was then on friendly terms. He who is in any way able to make some

sense of the last words of the poem, will divine why I preferred and admired

it:  there  is  greatness  in  them.  Pain  is  not  regarded  as  an  objection  to

existence: " And if you have no bliss now left to crown me-Lead on ! You

have your Sorrow still." Maybe that my music is also great in this passage.

(The last note of the oboe, by the bye, is C sharp, not C. The latter is a

misprint.)  During  the  following  winter,  I  was  living  on  that  charmingly

peaceful Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, which cuts inland between

Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino. My health was not very good ; the winter was

cold and exceptionally rainy; and the small albergo in which I lived was so

close to the water that at night my sleep was disturbed if the sea was rough.

These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable; and yet, in

spite of it all, and as if in proof of my belief that everything decisive comes to

life in defiance of every obstacle, it was precisely during this winter and in

the midst of these unfavourable circumstances that my Zarathustra originated.In the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road

to Zoagli, which rises up through a forest of pines and gives one a view far

out to sea. In the afternoon, or as often as my health allowed, I walked round

the  whole  bay  from  Santa  Margherita  to  beyond  Porto  Fino.  This  spot

affected  me  all  the  more  deeply  because  it  was  so  dearly  loved  by  the

Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 1886

  I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small forgotten

world  of  happiness  for  the  last  time.  It  was  on  these  two  roads  that  all

Zarathustra  came  to  me,  above  all,  Zarathustra  himself  as  a  type-I  ought

rather to say that it was on these walks that he waylaid me.

  s2

  In order to understand this type, you must first be quite clear concerning

its fundamental physiological condition: this condition is what I call great

healthiness. In regard to this idea I cannot make my meaning more plain or

more personal than I have done already in one of the last aphorisms (No. 382)

of the fifth book of the Gaya Scienza: " We new, nameless, and unfathomable

creatures," so reads the passage, " we firstlings of a future still unproved-we

who have a new end in view also require new means to that end, that is to

say,  a  new  healthiness,  a  stronger,  keener,  tougher,  bolder,  and  merrier

healthiness than any that has existed heretofore. He who longs to feel in his

own soul the whole range of values and aims that have prevailed on earth

until his day, and to sail round all the coasts of this ideal ' Mediterranean Sea';

who, from the adventures of his own inmost experience, would gladly know

how it feels to be a conqueror and discoverer of the ideal;-as also how it is

with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the man of piety

and the godlike anchorite of yore ;-such a man requires one thing above all

for his purpose, and that is, great healthiness-such healthiness as he not only

possesses,  but  also  constantly  acquires  and  must  acquire,  because  he  is

continually sacrificing it again, and is compelled to sacrifice it! And now,

therefore, after having been long on the way, we Argonauts of the ideal,

whose  pluck  is  greater  than  prudence  would  allow,  and  who  are  often

shipwrecked and bruised, but, as I have said, healthier than people would like

to admit, dangerously healthy, and for ever recovering our health- it would

seem as if we had before us, as a reward for all our toils, a country still

undiscovered, the horizon of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to every

country and every refuge of the ideal that man has ever known, a world so

overflowing with beauty, strangeness, doubt, terror, and divinity, that bothour curiosity and our lust of possession are frantic with eagerness. Alas! how

in the face of such vistas, and with such burning desire in our conscience and

consciousness, could we still be content with the man of the present day ?

This is bad indeed; but, that we should regard his worthiest aims and hopes

with  ill-concealed  amusement,  or  perhaps  give  them  no  thought  at  all,  is

inevitable. Another ideal now leads us on, a wonderful, seductive ideal, full

of danger, the pursuit of which we should be loath to urge upon any one,

because we are not so ready to acknowledge any one's right to it: the ideal of

a  spirit  who  plays  ingenuously  (that  is  to  say,  involuntarily,  and  as  the

outcome  of  superabundant  energy  and  power)  with  everything  that,  until

now, has been called holy, good, inviolable, and divine; to whom even the

loftiest thing that the people have with reason made their measure of value

would be no better than a danger, a decay, and an abasement, or at least a

relaxation  and  temporary  forgetfulness  of  self:  the  ideal  of  a  humanly

superhuman  well-being  and  goodwill,  which  often  enough  will  seem

inhuman-as when, for instance, it stands beside all past earnestness on earth,

and all past solemnities in hearing, speech, tone, look, morality, and duty, as

their  most  lifelike  and  unconscious  parody-  but  with  which,  nevertheless,

great  earnestness  perhaps  alone  begins,  the  first  note  of  interrogation  is

affixed,  the  fate  of  the  soul  changes,  the  hour  hand  moves,  and  tragedy

begins."

  s3

  Has anyone at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of

what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration ? If not, I

will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of superstition left in one, it

would hardly be possible completely to set aside the idea that one is the mere

incarnation,  mouthpiece,  or  medium  of  an  almighty  power.  The  idea  of

revelation,  in  the  sense  that  something  which  profoundly  convulses  and

upsets one becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty

and accuracy-describes the simple fact. One hears-one does not seek; one

takes-one  does  not  ask  who  gives:  a  thought  suddenly  flashes  up  like

lightning, it comes with necessity, without faltering-I have never had any

choice in the matter. There is an ecstasy so great that the immense strain of it

is  sometimes  relaxed  by  a  flood  of  tears,  during  which  one's  steps  now

involuntarily rush and anon involuntarily lag. There is the feeling that one is

utterly out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number

of fine thrills and titillations descending to one's very toes ;-there is a depth ofhappiness in which the most painful and gloomy parts do not act as antitheses

to the rest, but are produced and required as necessary shades of colour in

such an overflow of light. There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which

embraces  a  whole  world  of  forms  (length,  the  need  of  a  wide-embracing

rhythm,  is  almost  the  measure  of  the  force  of  an  inspiration,  a  sort  of

counterpart  to  its  pressure  and  tension).  Everything  happens  quite

involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of

power and divinity. The involuntary nature of the figures and similes is the

most  remarkable  thing;  one  loses  all  perception  of  what  is  imagery  and

metaphor ; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the truest, and

simplest means of expression. It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra's

own phrases, as if all things came to one, and offered themselves as similes.

(" Here do all things come caressingly to your discourse and flatter you, for

they would gladly ride upon your back. On every simile you ride here unto

every truth. Here fly open unto you all the speech and word shrines of the

world, here would all existence become speech, here would all Becoming

learn of you how to speak.") This is my experience of inspiration. I do not

doubt but that I should have to go back thousands of years before I could find

another who could say to me : " It is mine also ! "

  s4

  For a few weeks afterwards I lay an invalid in Genoa. Then followed a

melancholy spring in Rome, where I only just managed to live-and this was

no easy matter. This city, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of

Zarathustra, and for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me

inordinately  miserable.  I  tried  to  leave  it.  I  wanted  to  go  to  Aquila-the

opposite  of  Rome  in  every  respect,  and  actually  founded  in  a  spirit  of

hostility towards that city, just as I also shall found a city some day, as a

memento  of  an  atheist  and  genuine  enemy  of  the  Church,  a  person  very

closely related to me, the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick II. But

Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome. In the end I was obliged

to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had exerted myself in vain to

find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that on one occasion, to avoid bad smells

as much as possible, I actually inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether

they could not provide a quiet room for a philosopher. In a chamber high

above the Piazza just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of

Rome, and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all

songs was composed-" The Night-Song." About this time I was obsessed byan unspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the words, "

dead through immortality." ... In the summer, finding myself once more in the

sacred place where the first thought of Zarathustra flashed like a light across

my mind, I conceived the second part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the

second,  the  first,  nor  the  third  part,  have  I  required  a  day  longer.  In  the

ensuing winter, beneath the halcyon sky of Nice, which then for the first time

poured its light into my life, I found the third Zarathustra-and came to the end

of my task: the whole having occupied me scarcely a year. Many hidden

corners and heights in the country round about Nice are hallowed for me by

moments that I can never forget. That decisive chapter, entitled " Old and

New Tables," was composed during the arduous ascent from the station to

Eza  -that  wonderful  Moorish  village  in  the  rocks.  During  those  moments

when my creative energy flowed most plentifully, my muscular activity was

always greatest. The body is inspired: let us waive the question of " soul." I

might often have been seen dancing in those days, and I could then walk for

seven or eight hours on end over the hills without a suggestion of fatigue. I

slept well and laughed a good deal--I was perfectly robust and patient.

  s5

  With the exception of these periods of industry lasting ten days, the years

I spent during the production of Zarathustra, and thereafter, were for me years

of unparalleled distress. A man pays dearly for being immortal: to this end he

must die many times over during his life. There is such a thing as what I call

the rancour of greatness : everything great, whether a work or a deed, once it

is completed, turns immediately against its author. The very fact that he is its

author makes him weak at this time. He can no longer endure his deed. He

can no longer look it full in the face. To have something at one's back which

one could never have willed, something to which the knot of human destiny

is  attached-and  to  be  forced  thenceforward  to  bear  it  on  one's  shoulders!

Why,  it  almost  crushes  one  !  The  rancour  of  greatness  !  A  some-what

different experience is the uncanny silence that reigns about one. Solitude has

seven skins which nothing can penetrate. One goes among men ; one greets

friends: but these things are only new deserts, the looks of those one meets no

longer  bear  a  greeting.  At  the  best  one  encounters  a  sort  of  revolt.  This

feeling of revolt, I suffered, in varying degrees of intensity, at the hands of

almost everyone who came near me; it would seem that nothing inflicts a

deeper wound than suddenly to make one's distance felt. Those noble natures

are scarce who know not how to live unless they can revere. A third thing isthe absurd susceptibility of the skin to small pin-pricks, a kind of helplessness

in the presence of all small things. This seems to me a necessary outcome of

the appalling expenditure of all defensive forces, which is the first condition

of every creative act, of every act which proceeds from the most intimate,

most  secret,  and  most  concealed  recesses  of  a  man's  being.  The  small

defensive forces are thus, as it were, suspended, and no fresh energy reaches

them. I even think it probable that one does not digest so well, that one is less

willing to move, and that one is much too open to sensations of coldness and

suspicion; for, in a large number of cases, suspicion is merely a blunder in

etiology. On one occasion when I felt like this I became conscious of the

proximity of a herd of cows, some time before I could possibly have seen it

with my eyes, simply owing to a return in me of milder and more humane

sentiments : they communicated warmth to me. . . .

  s6

  This  work  stands  alone.  Do  not  let  us  mention  the  poets  in  the  same

breath: nothing perhaps has ever been produced out of such a superabundance

of  strength.  My  concept  "  Dionysian  "  here  became  the  highest  deed  ;

compared  with  it  everything  that  other  men  have  done  seems  poor  and

limited. The fact that a Goethe or a Shakespeare would not for an instant have

known how to take breath in this atmosphere of passion and of the heights ;

the fact that by the side of Zarathustra, Dante is no more than a believer, and

not one who first creates the truth-that is to say, not a world-ruling spirit, a

Fate; the fact that the poets of the Veda were priests and not even fit to

unfasten Zarathustra's sandal-all this is the least of things, and gives no idea

of the distance, of the azure solitude, in which this work dwells. Zarathustra

has an eternal right to say : " I draw around me circles and holy boundaries.

Ever fewer are they that mount with me to ever loftier heights. I build me a

mountain range of ever holier mountains." If all the spirit and goodness of

every great soul were collected together, the whole could not create a single

one of Zarathustra's discourses. The ladder upon which he rises and descends

is of boundless length; he has seen further, he has willed further, and gone

further  than  any  other  man.  There  is  contradiction  in  every  word  that  he

utters, this most yea-saying of all spirits. Through him all contradictions are

bound up into a new unity. The loftiest and the basest powers of human

nature, the sweetest, the lightest, and the most terrible, rush forth from out

one spring with everlasting certainty. Until his coming no one knew what was

height, or depth, and still less what was truth. There is not a single passage inthis revelation of truth which had already been anticipated and divined by

even the greatest among men. Before Zarathustra there was no wisdom, no

probing of the soul, no art of speech : in his book, the most familiar and most

vulgar  thing  utters  unheard-of  words.  The  sentence  quivers  with  passion.

Eloquence has become music. Forks of lightning are hurled towards futures

of which no one has ever dreamed before. The most powerful use of parables

that has yet existed is poor beside it, and mere child's-play compared with

this return of language to the nature of imagery. See how Zarathustra goes

down from the mountain and speaks the kindest words to every one! See with

what delicate fingers he touches his very adversaries, the priests, and how he

suffers  with  them  from  themselves  !  Here,  at  every  moment,  man  is

overcome, and the concept " overman " becomes the greatest reality,-out of

sight, almost far away beneath him, lies all that which heretofore has been

called great in man. The halcyonic brightness, the light feet, the presence of

wickedness and exuberance throughout, and all that is the essence of the type

Zara-thustra, was never dreamt of before as a prerequisite of greatness. In

precisely  these  limits  of  space  and  in  this  accessibility  to  opposites

Zarathustra feels himself the highest of all living things : and when you hear

how he defines this highest, you will give up trying to find his equal. " The

soul which hath the longest ladder and can step down deepest, " The vastest

soul that can run and stray and rove furthest in its own domain, " The most

necessary soul, that out of desire flings itself to chance, " The stable soul that

plunges into Becoming, the possessing soul that must needs taste of willing

and longing, " The soul that flies from itself, and over-takes itself in the

widest circle, " The wisest soul that folly exhorts most sweetly, " The most

self-loving soul, in whom all things have their rise, their ebb and flow." But

this is the very idea of Dionysus. Another consideration leads to this idea.

The psychological problem presented by the type of Zarathustra is, how can

he, who in an unprecedented manner says no, and acts no, in regard to all that

which has been affirmed until now, remain nevertheless a yea-saying spirit ?

how can he who bears the heaviest destiny on his shoulders and whose very

life-task  is  a  fatality,  yet  be  the  brightest  and  the  most  transcendental  of

spirits-for Zarathustra is a dancer? how can he who has the hardest and most

terrible grasp of reality, and who has thought the most " abysmal thoughts,"

nevertheless avoid conceiving these things as objections to existence, or even

as objections to the eternal recurrence of existence ?- how is it that on the

contrary  he  finds  reasons  for  being  himself  the  eternal  affirmation  of  allthings, " the tremendous and unlimited saying of Yea and Amen"?..." Into

every abyss do I bear the benediction of my yea to Life." . . . But this, once

more, is precisely the idea of Dionysus.

  s7

  What language will such a spirit speak, when he speaks unto his soul ?

The language of the dithyramb. I am the inventor of the dithyramb. Listen

unto the manner in which Zarathustra speaks to his soul Before Sunrise (iii.

48). Before my time such emerald joys and divine tenderness had found no

tongue. Even the profoundest melancholy of such a Dionysus takes shape as a

dithyramb. As an example of this I take " The Night-Song,"-the immortal

plaint of one who, thanks to his superabundance of light and power, thanks to

the sun within him, is condemned never to love. " It is night: now do all

gushing springs raise their voices. And my soul too is a gushing spring. "It is

night: now only do all lovers burst into song. And my soul too is the song of

a lover. " Something unquenched and unquenchable is within me, that would

raise  its  voice.  A  craving  for  love  is  within  me,  which  itself  speaks  the

language  of  love.  "  Light  am  I:  would  that  I  were  night!  But  this  is  my

loneliness, that I am begirt with light. " Alas, why am I not dark and like unto

the night! How joyfully would I then suck at the breasts of light! " And even

you would I bless, you twinkling starlets and glow-worms on high! and be

blessed in the gifts of your light. " But in mine own light do I live, ever back

into myself do I drink the flames I send forth. " I know not the happiness of

the hand stretched forth to grasp ; and oft have I dreamt that stealing must be

more blessed than taking. " Wretched am I that my hand may never rest from

giving -. an envious fate is mine that I see expectant eyes and nights made

bright with longing. " Oh, the wretchedness of all them that give! Oh, the

clouds that cover the face of my sun! That craving for desire! that burning

hunger at the end of the feast! " They take what I give them; but do I touch

their soul ? A gulf is there 'twixt giving and taking ; and the smallest gulf is

the last to be bridged. " An appetite is born from out my beauty : would that I

might do harm to them that I fill with light; would that I might rob them of

the gifts I have given:-thus do I thirst for wickedness. " To withdraw my hand

when their hand is ready stretched forth like the waterfall that wavers, wavers

even in its fall:-thus do I thirst for wickedness. " For such vengeance does my

fullness yearn : to such tricks does my loneliness give birth. " My joy in

giving died with the deed. By its very fullness did my virtue grow weary of

itself. " He who gives risks to lose his shame; he that is ever distributinggrows callous in hand and heart from that. " Mine eyes no longer melt into

tears at the sight of the suppliant's shame; my hand hath become too hard to

feel the quivering of laden hands. " Whither have you fled, the tears of mine

eyes and the bloom of my heart ? Oh, the solitude of all givers ! Oh, the.

silence of all beacons ! " Many are the suns that circle in barren space; to all

that is dark do they speak with their light- to me alone are they silent. " Alas,

this is the hatred of light for that which shines : pitiless it runs its course. "

Unfair in its inmost heart to that which shines ; cold toward suns,-thus does

every sun go its way. " Like a tempest do the suns fly over their course : for

such is their way. Their own unswerving will do they follow: that is their

coldness. " Alas, it is you alone, you creatures of gloom, you spirits of the

night, that take your warmth from that which shines. You alone suck your

milk and comfort from the udders of light. " Alas, about me there is ice, my

hand burns itself against ice! " Alas, within me is a thirst that thirsts for your

thirst! " It is night: woe is me, that I must needs be light! And thirst after

darkness! And loneliness! " It is night: now does my longing burst forth like a

spring,-for speech do I long. " It is night: now do all gushing springs raise

their voices. And my soul too is a gushing spring. " It is night: now only do

all lovers burst into song. And my soul too is the song of a lover."

  s8

  Such things have never been written, never been felt, never been suffered:

only a God, only Dionysus suffers in this way. The reply to such a dithyramb

on the sun's solitude in light would be Ariadne. . . . Who knows, but I, who

Ariadne is ! To all such riddles no one heretofore had ever found an answer; I

doubt even whether anyone had ever seen a riddle here. One day Zarathustra

severely WHY I WRITE SUCH EXCELLENT BOOKS 113

    determines his life-task-and it is also mine. Let no one misunderstand its

meaning.  It  is  a  yea-saying  to  the  point  of  justifying,  to  the  point  of

redeeming even all that is past. " I walk among men as among fragments of

the future : of that future which I see. " And all my creativeness and effort is

but this, that I may be able to think and recast all these fragments and riddles

and dismal accidents into one piece. " And how could I bear to be a man, if

man were not also a poet, a riddle reader, and a redeemer of chance! " To

redeem all the past, and to transform every ' it was ' into ' thus would I have

it'-that alone would be my salvation ! " In another passage he defines as

strictly as possible what to him alone " man " can be,-not a subject for love

nor yet for pity-Zarathustra became master even of his loathing of man : manis  to  him  a  thing  unshaped,  raw  material,  an  ugly  stone  that  needs  the

sculptor's chisel. " No longer to will, no longer to value, no longer to create!

Oh,  that  this  great  weariness  may  never  be  mine  !  "  Even  in  the  lust  of

knowledge, I feel only the joy of my will to beget and to grow; and if there be

innocence in my knowledge, it is because my procreative will is in it. " Away

from God and gods did this will lure me: what would there be to create if

there were gods ? " But to man does it ever drive me anew, my burning,

creative will. Thus drives it the hammer to the stone. " Alas, you men, within

the stone there sleeps an image for me, the image of all my dreams! Alas, that

it should have to sleep in the hardest and ugliest stone! " Now rages my

hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone the fragments fly: what's

that to me ? " I will finish it: for a shadow came unto me- the stillest and

lightest thing on earth once came unto me ! " The beauty of the overman

came unto me as a shadow. Alas, my brothers ! What are the- gods to me

now ? " Let me call attention to one last point of view. The line in italics is

my pretext for this remark. A Dionysian life-task needs the hardness of the

hammer,  and  one  of  its  first  essentials  is  without  doubt  the  joy  even  of

destruction. The command, " Harden yourselves !" and the deep conviction

that all creators are hard, is the really distinctive sign of a Dionysian nature.

    PART 10 - "BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL" The Prelude to a Philosophy

                                    of the Future"

  s1

  My  work  for  the  years  that  followed  was  prescribed  as  distinctly  as

possible. Now that the yea-saying part of my life-task was accomplished,

there  came  the  turn  of  the  negative  portion,  both  in  word  and  deed:  the

transvaluation of all values that had existed until now, the great war,-the con-

juring-up of the day when the fatal outcome of the struggle would be decided.

Meanwhile, I had slowly to look about me for my peers, for those who, out of

strength, would proffer me a helping hand in my work of destruction. From

that time onward, all my writings are so much bait: maybe I understand as

much about fishing as most people ? If nothing was caught, it was not I who

was at fault. There were no fish to come and bite. 0

  In all its essential points, this book (1886) is a criticism of modernity,

embracing  the  modern  sciences,  arts,  even  politics,  together  with  certain

indications as to a type which would be the reverse of modern man, or as

little like him as possible, a noble and yea-saying type. In this last respect thebook is a school for gentlemen-the term gentleman being understood here in

a much more spiritual and radical sense than it has implied until now. All

those  things  of  which  the  age  is  proud,-  as,  for  instance,  far-famed  "

objectivity," " sympathy with all that suffers," " the historical sense," with its

subjection to foreign tastes, with its lying-in-the-dust before petits faits, and

the  rage  for  science,-  are  shown  to  be  the  contradiction  of  the  type

recommended, and are regarded as almost ill-bred. If you remember that this

book follows upon Zarathustra, you may possibly guess to what system of

diet  it  owes  its  life.  The  eye  which,  owing  to  tremendous  constraint,  has

become accustomed to see at a great distance,-Zara-thustra is even more far-

sighted than the Tsar,- is here forced to focus sharply that which is close at

hand, the present time, the things that lie about him. In all the aphorisms and

more  particularly  in  the  form  of  this  book,  the  reader  will  find  the  same

voluntary  turning  away  from  those  instincts  which  made  a  Zarathustra  a

possible feat. Refinement in form, in aspiration, and in the art of keeping

silent, are its more or less obvious qualities ; psychology is handled with

deliberate hardness and cruelty,--the whole book does not contain one single

good-natured word. . . . All this sort of thing refreshes a man. Who can guess

the kind of recreation that is necessary after such an expenditure of goodness

as is to be found in Zarathustra! From a theological standpoint- now pay you

heed; for it is but on rare occasions that I speak as a theologian-it was God

Himself who, at the end of His great work, coiled Himself up in the form of a

serpent at the foot of the tree of knowledge. It was thus that He recovered

from being a God. . . . He had made everything too beautiful. . . . The devil is

simply God's moment of idleness, on that seventh day.

                  PART 11 - "THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS"

  s1

  The  three  essays  which  constitute  this  genealogy  are,  as  regards

expression,  aspiration,  and  the  art  of  the  unexpected,  perhaps  the  most

curious things that have ever been written. Dionysus, as you know, is also the

god of darkness. In each case the beginning is calculated to mystify; it is

cool, scientific, even ironical, intentionally thrust to the fore, intentionally

reticent. Gradually less calmness prevails; here and there a flash of lightning

defines the horizon; exceedingly unpleasant truths break upon your ears from

out remote distances with a dull, rumbling sound,-until very soon a fierce

tempo is attained in which everything presses forward at a terrible degree of

tension.  At  the  end,  in  each  case,  amid  fearful  thunderclaps,  a  new  truthshines out between thick clouds. The truth of the first essay is the psychology

of Christianity : the birth of Christianity out of the spirit of resentment, not,

as is supposed, out of the " Spirit,"-in all its essentials, a counter-movement,

the great insurrection against the dominion of noble values. The second essay

contains the psychology of conscience: this is not, as you may believe, " the

voice of God in man " ; it is the instinct of cruelty, which turns inwards once

it is unable to discharge itself outwardly. Cruelty is here exposed, for the first

time, as one of the oldest and most indispensable elements in the foundation

of  culture.  The  third  essay  replies  to  the  question  as  to  the  origin  of  the

formidable power of the ascetic ideal, of the priest ideal, despite the fact that

this  ideal  is  essentially  detrimental,  that  it  is  a  will  to  nonentity  and  to

decadence.  Reply  :  it  flourished  not  because  God  was  active  behind  the

priests, as is generally believed, but because it was a faute de mieux-from the

fact that until now it has been the only ideal and has had no competitors. "

For man prefers to aspire to nonentity than not to aspire at all." But above all,

until the time of Zarathustra there was no such thing as a counter-ideal. You

have  understood  my  meaning.  Three  decisive  overtures  on  the  part  of  a

psychologist to a Transvaluation of all Values.-This book contains the first

psychology of the priest.

    PART 12 - "THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS" How to Philosophise

                                  with the Hammer

  s1

  This work-which covers scarcely one hundred and fifty pages, with its

cheerful and fateful tone, like a laughing demon, and the production of which

occupied so few days that I hesitate to give their number-is altogether an

exception  among  books  :  there  is  no  work  more  rich  in  substance,  more

independent, more upsetting-more wicked. If anyone should desire to obtain

a rapid sketch of how everything, before my time, was standing on its head,

he should begin reading me in this book. That which is called " Idols " on the

title page is simply the old truth that has been believed in until now. In plain

English, The Twilight of the Idols means that the old truth is on its last legs. 2

  s2

  There is no reality, no " ideality," which has not been touched in this book

(touched! what a cautious euphemism !). Not only the eternal idols, but also

the youngest-that is to say, the most senile: modern ideas, for instance. A

strong wind blows between the trees and in all directions fall the fruit-the

truths. There is the waste of an all-too-rich autumn in this book : you trip
