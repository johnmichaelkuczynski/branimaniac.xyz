  (1886)

  1

    Whatever may be at the bottom of this questionable book, it must have

been  an  exceptionally  significant  and  fascinating  question,  and  deeply

personal at that: the time in which it was written, in spite of which it was

written, bears witness to that--the exciting time of the Franco-Prussian war of

1870-71. As the thunder of the Battle of W�rth was rolling over Europe, the

muser and riddle-friend who was to be the father of this book sat somewhere

in an alpine nook, very bemused and beriddled, hence very concerned and yet

unconcerned, and wrote down his thoughts about the Greeks--the core of the

strange  and  almost  inaccessible  book  to  which  this  belated  preface  (or

postscript) shall now be added. A few weeks later--and he himself was to be

found under the walls of Metz, still wedded to the question marks that he had

placed  after  the  alleged  "cheerfulness"  of  the  Greeks  and  of  Greek  art.

Eventually, in that month of profoundest suspense when the peace treaty was

being debated at Versailles, he, too, made peace with himself and, slowly

convalescing from an illness contracted at the front, completed the final draft

of The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music.--Out of music? Music and

tragedy?  Greeks  and  the  music  of  tragedy?  Greeks  and  the  art  form  of

pessimism?  The  best  turned  out,  most  beautiful,  most  envied  type  of

humanity to date, those most apt to seduce us to life, the Greeks--how now?

They of all people should of needed tragedy? Even more--art? For what--

Greek art?

  You  will  guess  where  the  big  question  mark  concerning  the  value  of

existence has thus been raised. Is pessimism necessarily a sign of decline,

decay, degeneration, weary and weak instincts--as it once was in India and

now is, to all appearances, among us, "modern" men and Europeans? Is there

pessimism of strength? An intellectual predilection for the hard, gruesome,

evil,  problematic  aspect  of  existence,  prompted  by  well-being,  by

overflowing health, by the fullness of existence? Is it perhaps possible to

suffer precisely from overfullness? The sharp-eyed courage that tempts andattempts, that craves the frightful as the enemy, the worthy enemy, against

whom one can test one's strength? From whom one can learn what it means

"to be frightened"? What is the significance of the tragic myth among the

Greeks  of  the  best,  the  strongest,  the  most  courageous  period?  And  the

tremendous phenomenon of the Dionysian--and, born from it, tragedy--what

might they signify?-- And again: that of which tragedy died, the Socratism of

morality, the dialectics, frugality, and cheerfulness of the theoretical man--

how now? Might not this very Socratism be a sign of decline, of weariness,

of infection, of the anarchical dissolution of the instincts? And the "Greek

cheerfulness" of the later Greeks--merely the afterglow of the sunset? The

Epicureans  resolve  against  pessimism--a  mere  precaution  of  the  afflicted?

And science itself, our science--indeed, what is the significance of all science,

viewed as a symptom of life? For what--worse yet, whence--all science? How

now? Is the resolve to be so scientific about everything perhaps a kind of fear

of,  an  escape  from,  pessimism?  A  subtle  last  resort  against--truth?  And,

morally speaking, a sort of cowardice and falseness? Amorally speaking, a

ruse? O Socrates, Socrates, was that perhaps your secret? O enigmatic ironist,

was that perhaps your--irony?

  2

  What I then got hold of, something frightful and dangerous, a problem

with horns but not necessarily a bull, in any case a new problem--today I

should say that it was the problem of science itself, science considered for the

first time as problematic, as questionable. But the book in which my youthful

courage and suspicion found an outlet--what an impossible book had to result

from a task so uncongenial to youth! Constructed from a lot of immature,

overgreen  personal  experiences,  all  of  them  close  to  the  limits  of

communication, presented in the context of art--for the problem of science

cannot be recognized in the context of science--a book perhaps for artists

who also have an analytic and retrospective penchant (in other words, an

exceptional type of artist for whom one might have to look far and wide and

really would not care to look); a book full of psychological innovations and

artists'  secrets,  with  an  artists'  metaphysics  in  the  background;  a  youthful

work  full  of  the  intrepid  mood  of  youth,  the  moodiness  of  youth,

independent,  defiantly  self-reliant  even  where  it  seems  to  bow  before  an

authority and personal reverence; in sum, a first book, also in every bad sense

of that label. In spite of the problem which seems congenial to old age, the

book is marked by every defect of youth, with its "length in excess: and its"storm and stress." On the other hand, considering its success (especially with

the great artist to whom it addressed itself as in a dialogue, Richard Wagner),

it is a proven book, I mean one that in any case satisfied "the best minds of

the  time."  In  view  of  that,  it  really  ought  to  be  treated  with  some

consideration and taciturnity. Still, I do not want to suppress entirely how

disagreeable it now seems to me, how strange it appears now, after sixteen

years--before a much older, a hundred times more demanding, but by no

means colder eye which has not become a stranger to the task which this

audacious book dared to tackle for the first time: to look at science in the

perspective of the artist, but at art in that of life.

  3

  To say it once more: today I find it an impossible book: I consider it

badly  written,  ponderous,  embarrassing,  image-mad  and  image-confused,

sentimental, in places saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo,

without  the  will  to  logical  cleanliness,  very  convinced  and  therefore

disdainful of proof, mistrustful even of the propriety of proof, a book for

initiates, "music" for those dedicated to music, those who are closely related

to begin with on the basis of common and rare aesthetic experiences, "music"

meant as a sign of recognition for close relatives in arbitus [In the arts.]--an

arrogant and rhapsodic book that ought to exclude right from the beginning

the profanum vulgus [The profane crowd.] of "the educated" even more than

"the mass" or "folk." Still, the effect of the book proved and proves that it had

a knack for seeking our fellow-rhapsodizers and for luring them on to new

secret paths and dancing places. What found expression here was anyway--

this was admitted with as much curiosity as antipathy--a strange voice, the

disciple of a still "unknown God," one who concealed himself for the time

being under the scholar's hood, under the gravity and dialectical ill-humor of

the German, even under the bad manners of the Wagnerian. Here was a spirit

with  strange,  still  nameless  needs,  a  memory  bursting  with  questions,

experiences, concealed things after which the name of Dionysus was added

as one more question mark. What spoke here--as was admitted, not without

suspicion--was  something  like  a  mystical,  almost  maenadic  soul  that

stammered with difficulty, a feat of the will, as in a strange tongue, almost

undecided whether it should communicate or conceal itself. It should have

sung, this "new soul"--and not spoken! What I had to say then--too bad that I

did  not  dare  say  it  as  a  poet:  perhaps  I  had  the  ability.  Or  at  least  as  a

philologist: after all, even today practically everything in this field remains tobe discovered and dug up by philologists! Above all, the problem that there is

a problem here--and that the Greeks, as long as we lack an answer to the

question  "what  is  Dionysian?"  remain  as  totally  uncomprehended  and

unimaginable as ever.

  4

  Indeed, what is Dionysian?-- This book contains an answer: one "who

knows" is talking, the initiate and disciple of his god. Now I should perhaps

speak  more  cautiously  and  less  eloquently  about  such  a  difficult

psychological question as that concerning the origin of tragedy among the

Greeks. The question of the Greek's relation to pain, his degree of sensitivity,

is basic: did this relation remain constant? Or did it change radically? The

question  is  whether  his  ever  stronger  craving  for  beauty,  for  festivals,

pleasures, new cults was rooted in some deficiency, privation, melancholy,

pain? Supposing that this were true--and Pericles (or Thucydides) suggests as

much in the great funeral oration--how should we then have to explain the

origin of the opposite craving, which developed earlier in time, the craving

for the ugly; the good, severe will of the older Greeks to pessimism, to the

tragic myth, to the image of everything underlying existence that is frightful,

evil, a riddle, destructive, fatal? What, then, would be the origin of tragedy?

Perhaps  joy,  strength,  overflowing  health,  overgreat  fullness?  And  what,

then, is the significance, physiologically speaking, of that madness out of

which tragic and comic art developed--the Dionysian madness? How now? Is

madness perhaps not necessarily the symptom of degeneration, decline, and

the final stage of culture? Are there perhaps--a question for psychiatrists--

neuroses of health? of the youth and youthfulness of a people? Where does

that synthesis of god and billy goat in the satyr point? What experience of

himself, what urge compelled the Greek to conceive the Dionysian enthusiast

and primeval man as a satyr? And regarding the origin of the tragic chorus:

did  those  centuries  when  the  Greek  body  flourished  and  the  Greek  soul

foamed  over  with  health  perhaps  know  endemic  ecstasies?  Visions  and

hallucinations shared by entire communities or assemblies at a cult? How

now? Should the Greeks, precisely in the abundance of their youth, have had

the will to the tragic and have been pessimists? Should it have been madness,

to use one of Plato's phrases, that brought the greatest blessings upon Greece?

On the other hand, conversely, could it be that the Greeks became more and

more  optimistic,  superficial,  and  histrionic  precisely  in  the  period  of

dissolution and weakness--more and more ardent for logic and logicizing theworld  and  thus  more  "cheerful"  and  "scientific"?  How  now?  Could  it  be

possible that, in spite of all "modern ideas" and the prejudices of a democratic

taste, the triumph of optimism, the gradual prevalence of rationality, practical

and theoretical utilitarianism, no less than democracy itself which developed

at the same time, might all have been symptoms of a decline of strength, of

impending  old  age,  and  of  physiological  weariness?  These,  and  not

pessimism? Was Epicure an optimist--precisely because he was afflicted?

  It is apparent that it was a whole cluster of grave questions with which

this book burdened itself. Let us add the gravest question of all. What, seen in

the perspective of life, is the significance of morality?

  5

  Already  in  the  preface  addressed  to  Richard  Wagner,  art,  and  not

morality, is presented as the truly metaphysical activity of man. In the book

itself the suggestive sentence is repeated several times, that the existence of

the world is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. Indeed, the whole

book knows only an artistic meaning and crypto-meaning behind all events--a

"god," if you please, but certainly only an entirely reckless and amoral artist-

god who wants to experience, whether he is building or destroying, in the

good and in the bad, his own joy and glory--one who, creating worlds, frees

himself from the distress of fullness and overfullness and from the affliction

of the contradictions compressed in his soul. The world--at every moment the

attained salvation of God, as the eternally changing, eternally new vision of

the most deeply afflicted, discordant, and contradictory being who can find

salvation only in appearance: you can call this whole artists' metaphysics

arbitrary, idle, fantastic; what matters is that it betrays a spirit who will one

day fight at any risk whatever the moral interpretation and significance of

existence. Here, perhaps for the first time, a pessimism "beyond good and

evil"  is  suggested.  Here  that  "perversity  of  mind"  gains  speech  and

formulation against which Schopenhauer never wearied of hurling in advance

his most irate curses and thunderbolts: a philosophy that dares to move, to

demote,  morality  into  the  realm  of  appearance--and  not  merely  among

"appearances"  or  phenomena  (in  the  sense  assigned  to  these  words  by

Idealistic  philosophers),  but  among  "deceptions,"  as  semblance,  delusion,

error, interpretation, contrivance, art.

  Perhaps the depth of this antimoral propensity is best inferred from the

careful and hostile silence with which Christianity is treated throughout the

whole book--Christianity as the most prodigal elaboration of the moral themeto which humanity has ever been subjected. In truth, nothing could be more

opposed to the purely aesthetic interpretation and justification of the world

which are taught in this book than the Christian teaching, which is, and wants

to be, only moral and which relegates art, every art, to the realm of lies; with

its  absolute  standards,  beginning  with  the  truthfulness  of  God,  it  negates,

judges, and damns art. Behind this mode of thought and valuation, which

must be hostile to art if it is at all genuine, I never failed to sense a hostility to

life--a furious, vengeful antipathy to life itself: for all of life is based on

semblance, art, deception, points of view, and the necessity of perspectives

and  error.  Christianity  was  from  the  beginning,  essentially  and

fundamentally, life's nausea and disgust with life, merely concealed behind,

masked by, dressed up as, faith in "another: or "better" life. Hatred of "the

world,"  condemnations  of  the  passions,  fear  of  beauty  and  sensuality,  a

beyond invented the better to slander this life, at bottom a craving for the

nothing, for the end, for respite, for "the sabbath of sabbaths"--all this always

struck me, no less than the unconditional will of Christianity to recognize

only moral values, as the most dangerous and uncanny form of all possible

forms of a "will to decline"--at the very least a sign of abysmal sickness,

weariness, discouragement, exhaustion, and the impoverishment of life. For,

confronted with morality (especially Christian, or unconditional, morality),

life  must  continually  and  inevitably  be  in  the  wrong,  because  life  is

something  essentially  amoral--and  eventually,  crushed  by  the  weight  of

contempt and the eternal No, life must then be felt to be unworthy of desire

and altogether worthless. Morality itself--how now? might not morality be "a

will to negate life," a secret instinct of annihilation, a principle of decay,

diminution,  and  slander--the  beginning  of  the  end?  Hence,  the  danger  of

dangers?

  It  was  against  morality  that  my  instinct  turned  with  this  questionable

book,  long  ago;  it  was  an  instinct  that  aligned  itself  with  life  and  that

discovered for itself a fundamentally opposite doctrine and valuation of life--

purely artistic and anti-Christian. What to call it? As a philologist and man of

words I baptized it, not without taking some liberty--for who could claim to

know the rightful name of the Antichrist?--in the name of a Greek god: I

called it Dionysian.

  6

  It is clear what task I first dared to touch with this book? How I regret

now that in those days I still lacked the courage (or immodesty?) to permitmyself in every way an individual language of my own for such individual

views and hazards--and that instead I tried laboriously to express by means of

Schopenhauerian and Kantian formulas strange and new valuations which

were basically at odds with Kant's and Schopenhauer's spirit and taste! What,

after all, did Schopenhauer think of tragedy?

  "That which bestows on everything tragic its peculiar elevating force"--he

says in The World as Will and Representation, volume II, p. 495--"is the

discovery that the world, that life, can never give real satisfaction and hence

is not worthy of our affection: this constitutes the tragic spirit--it leads to

resignation."

  How differently Dionysus spoke to me! How far removed I was from all

this  resignationism!--  But  there  is  something  far  worse  in  this  book,

something I now regret still more than that I obscured and spoiled Dionysian

premonitions with Schopenhauerian formulations: namely, that I spoiled the

grandiose Greek problem, as it had arisen before my eyes, by introducing the

most modern problems! That I appended hopes where there was no ground

for hope, where everything pointed all too plainly to an end! That on the basis

of the latest German music I began to rave about "the German spirit" as if

that were in the process even then of discovering and finding itself again--at a

time when the German spirit which not long before had still had the will to

dominate  Europe  and  the  strength  to  lead  Europe,  was  just  making  its

testament and abdicating forever, making its transition, under the pompous

pretense  of  founding  a  Reich,  to  a  leveling  mediocrity,  democracy,  and

"modern ideas"!

  Indeed, meanwhile I have learned to consider this "German spirit" with a

sufficient lack of hope or mercy; also, contemporary German music, which is

romanticism  through  and  through  and  most  un-Greek  of  all  possible  art

forms--moreover, a first-rate poison for the nerves, doubly dangerous among

a people who love drink and who honor lack of clarity as a virtue, for it has

the double quality of a narcotic that both intoxicates and spreads a fog.

  To be sure, apart from all the hasty hopes and faulty applications to the

present  with  which  I  spoiled  my  first  book,  there  still  remains  the  great

Dionysian question mark I raised--regarding music as well: what would a

music have to like that would no longer be of romantic origin, like German

music--but Dionysian?

  7

  But, my dear sir, what in the world is romantic if your book isn't? Candeep  hatred  against  "the  Now,"  against  "reality"  and  "modern  ideas"  be

pushed  further  than  you  pushed  it  in  your  artists'  metaphysics?  believing

sooner in the Nothing, sooner in the devil than in "the Now"? Is it not a deep

bass of wrath and the lust for destruction that we hear humming underneath

all of your contrapuntal art and seduction of the ear, a furious resolve against

everything that is "now," a will that is not too far removed from practical

nihilism and seems to say: "sooner let nothing be true than that you should be

right, than that your truth should be prove right!"

  Listen yourself, my dear pessimist and art-deifier, but with open ears, to a

single passage chosen from your book--to the not ineloquent dragon-slayer

passage which may have an insidious pied-piper sound for young ears and

hearts. How now? Isn't this the typical creed of the romantic of 1830, masked

by the pessimism of 1850? Even the usual romantic finale is sounded--break,

breakdown, return and collapse before an old faith, before the old God. How

now?  Is  your  pessimists'  book  not  itself  a  piece  of  anti-Hellenism  and

romanticism? Is it not itself something "equally intoxicating and befogging,"

in any case a narcotic, even a piece of music, German music? But listen:

  "Let us imagine a coming generation with such intrepidity of vision, with

such a heroic penchant for the tremendous; let us imagine the bold stride of

these dragon-slayers, the proud audacity with which they turn their back on

all  the  weakling's  doctrines  of  optimism  in  order  to  'live  resolutely'  in

wholeness and fullness: would it not be necessary for the tragic man of such a

culture, in view of his self-education for seriousness and terror, to desire a

new art, the art of metaphysical comfort, and to exclaim with Faust:

  Should not my longing overleap the distance

  And draw the fairest form into existence?"

  [Quoted from Section 18]

    "Would it not be necessary?"--No, thrice no! O you young romantics: it

would not be necessary! But it is highly probable that it will end that way--

namely,  "comforted,"  as  it  is  written,  in  spite  of  all  self-education  for

seriousness  and  terror,  "comforted  metaphysically"--in  sum,  as  romantics

end, as Christians.

  No! You ought to learn the art of this-worldly comfort first; you ought to

learn  to  laugh,  my  young  friends,  if  you  are  hell-bent  on  remaining

pessimists.  Then  perhaps,  as  laughers,  you  may  some  day  dispatch  all

metaphysical comforts to the devil--metaphysics in front. Or, to say in the

language of that Dionysian monster who bears the name of Zarathustra:  "Raise up your hearts, my brothers, high, higher! And don't forget your

legs! Raise up your legs too, good dancers; and still better: stand on your

heads!

  "This crown of the laugher, this rose-wreath crown: I crown myself with

this crown; I myself pronounced holy my laughter. I did not find anyone else

today strong enough for that.

    "Zarathustra, the dancer; Zarathustra, the light one who beckons with his

wings,  preparing  for  a  flight,  beckoning  to  all  birds,  ready  and  heady,

blissfully lightheaded;

    "Zarathustra,  the  soothsayer;  Zarathustra,  the  sooth-laugher;  not

impatient; not unconditional; one who loves leaps and side-leaps: I crown

myself with this crown.

  "This crown of the laugher, this rose-wreath crown: to you, my brothers, I

throw this crown. Laughter I have pronounced holy: you higher men, learn--

to laugh!"

  Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part IV. ["On the Higher Man," 17-20, in part.]

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

                          PREFACE TO RICHARD WAGNER

  (1871)

  To  keep  at  a  distance  all  the  possible  scruples,  excitements,  and

misunderstandings  that  the  thoughts  united  in  this  essay  will  occasion,  in

view of the peculiar character of our aesthetic public, and to be able to write

these introductory remarks, too, with the same contemplative delight whose

reflection--the distillation of good and elevating hours--is evident on every

page,  I  picture  the  moment  when  you,  my  highly  respected  friend,  will

receive this essay. Perhaps after an evening walk in the winter snow, you will

behold  Prometheus  unbound  on  the  title  page,  read  my  name,  and  be

convinced  at  once  that,  whatever  this  essay  should  contain,  the  author

certainly has something serious and urgent to say; also that, as he hatched

these ideas, he was communicating with you as if you were present, and

hence could write down only what was in keeping with that presence. You

will recall that it was during the same period when your splendid Festschrift

on Beethoven came into being, amid the terrors and sublimities of the war

that had just broken out, that I collected myself for these reflections. Yetanyone would be mistaken if he associated my reflections with the contrast

between  patriotic  excitement  and  aesthetic  enthusiasm,  of  courageous

seriousness and a cheerful game: if he really read this essay, it would dawn

on him, to his surprise, what a seriously German problem is faced here and

placed right in the center of German hopes, as a vortex and turning point. But

perhaps such readers will find it offensive that an aesthetic problem should be

taken  so  seriously--assuming  they  are  unable  to  consider  art  more  than  a

pleasant sideline, a readily dispensable tinkling of bells that accompanies the

"seriousness of life," just as if nobody knew what was involved in such a

contrast  with  the  "seriousness  of  life."  Let  such  "serious"  readers  learn

something from the fact that I am convinced that art represents the highest

task and the truly metaphysical activity of this life, in the sense of that man to

whom, as my sublime predecessor on this path, I wish to dedicate this essay.

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

                              THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY

  1

  Much will have been gained for aesthetics once we have succeeded in

apprehending  directly--rather  than  merely  ascertaining--that  art  owes  its

continuous  evolution  to  the  Apollinian-  Dionysian  duality,  even  as  the

propagation of the species depends on the duality of the sexes, their constant

conflicts and periodic acts of reconciliation. I have borrowed my adjectives

from  the  Greeks,  who  developed  their  mystical  doctrines  of  art  through

plausible embodiments, not through purely conceptual means. It is by those

two  art  sponsoring  deities,  Apollo  and  Dionysus,  that  we  are  made  to

recognize  the  tremendous  split,  as  regards  both  origins  and  objectives,

between the plastic, Apollinian arts and the nonvisual art of music inspired by

Dionysus.  The  two  creative  tendencies  developed  alongside  one  another,

usually  in  fierce  opposition,  each  by  its  taunts  forcing  the  other  to  more

energetic  production,  both  perpetuating  in  a  discordant  concord  that  agon

which the term art but feebly denominates: until at last, by the thaumaturgy

of an Hellenic act of will, the pair accepted the yoke of marriage and, in this

condition, begot Attic tragedy, which exhibits the salient features of both

parents.

  To reach a closer understanding of both these tendencies, let us begin by

viewing  them  as  the  separate  art  realms  of  dream  and  intoxication,  two

physiological  phenomena  standing  toward  one  another  in  much  the  samerelationship as the Apollinian and Dionysian. It was in a dream, according to

Lucretius, that the marvelous gods and goddesses first presented themselves

to the minds of men. That great sculptor, Phidias, beheld in a dream the

entrancing bodies of more than human beings, and likewise, if anyone had

asked the Greek poets about the mystery of poetic creation, they too would

have referred him to dreams and instructed him much as Hans Sachs instructs

us in Die Meistersinger:

  The poet's task is this, my friend,

  to read his dreams and comprehend.

  The truest human fancy seems

  to be revealed to us in dreams:

  all poems and versification

  are but true dreams' interpretation.

  The fair illusion of the dream sphere, in the production of which every

man proves himself an accomplished artist, is a precondition not only of all

plastic art, but even, as we shall see presently, of a wide range of poetry. Here

we enjoy an immediate apprehension of form, all shapes speak to us directly,

nothing seems indifferent or redundant. Despite the high intensity with which

these dream realities exist for us, we still have a residual sensation that they

are illusions; at least such has been my experience-- and the frequency, not to

say normality, of the experience is borne out in many passages of the poets.

Men of philosophical disposition are known for their constant premonition

that our everyday reality, too, is an illusion, hiding another, totally different

kind of reality. It was Schopenhauer who considered the ability to view at

certain times all men and things as mere phantoms or dream images to be the

true mark of philosophic talent. The person who is responsive to the stimuli

of art behaves toward the reality of dream much the way the philosopher

behaves toward the reality of existence: he observes exactly and enjoys his

observations,  for  it  is  by  these  images  that  he  interprets  life,  by  these

processes that he rehearses it. Nor is it by pleasant images only that such

plausible connections are made: the whole divine comedy of life, including

its  somber  aspects,  its  sudden  balkings,  impish  accidents,  anxious

expectations,  moves  past  him,  not  quite  like  a  shadow  play--for  it  is  he

himself,  after  all,  who  lives  and  suffers  through  these  scenes--yet  never

without giving a fleeting sense of illusion; and I imagine that many persons

have reassured themselves amidst the perils of dream by calling out, "It is a

dream! I want it to go on." I have even heard of people spinning out thecausality of one and the same dream over three or more successive nights. All

these  facts  clearly  bear  witness  that  our  innermost  being,  the  common

substratum of humanity, experiences dreams with deep delight and a sense of

real  necessity.  This  deep  and  happy  sense  of  the  necessity  of  dream

experiences was expressed by the Greeks in the image of Apollo. Apollo is at

once  the  god  of  all  plastic  powers  and  the  soothsaying  god.  He  who  is

etymologically the "lucent" one, the god of light, reigns also over the fair

illusion of our inner world of fantasy. The perfection of these conditions in

contrast  to  our  imperfectly  understood  waking  reality,  as  well  as  our

profound awareness of nature's healing powers during the interval of sleep

and  dream,  furnishes  a  symbolic  analogue  to  the  soothsaying  faculty  and

quite generally to the arts, which make life possible and worth living. But the

image of Apollo must incorporate that thin line which the dream image may

not cross, under penalty of becoming pathological, of imposing itself on us as

crass reality: a discreet limitation, a freedom from all extravagant urges, the

sapient tranquillity of the plastic god. His eye must be sunlike, in keeping

with his origin. Even at those moments when he is angry and ill-tempered

there lies upon him the consecration of fair illusion. In an eccentric way one

might say of Apollo what Schopenhauer says, in the first part of The World

as  Will  and  Idea,  of  man  caught  in  the  veil  of  Maya:  "Even  as  on  an

immense,  raging  sea,  assailed  by  huge  wave  crests,  a  man  sits  in  a  little

rowboat trusting his frail craft, so, amidst the furious torments of this world,

the individual sits tranquilly, supported by the principium individuationis and

relying on it." One might say that the unshakable confidence in that principle

has  received  its  most  magnificent  expression  in  Apollo,  and  that  Apollo

himself may be regarded as the marvelous divine image of the principium

individuationis, whose looks and gestures radiate the full delight, wisdom,

and beauty of "illusion."

  In the same context Schopenhauer has described for us the tremendous

awe which seizes man when he suddenly begins to doubt the cognitive modes

of experience, in other words, when in a given instance the law of causation

seems to suspend itself. If we add to this awe the glorious transport which

arises in man, even from the very depths of nature, at the shattering of the

principium individuationis, then we are in a position to apprehend the essence

of  Dionysian  rapture,  whose  closest  analogy  is  furnished  by  physical

intoxication. Dionysian stirrings arise either through the influence of those

narcotic potions of which all primitive races speak in their hymns, or throughthe powerful approach of spring, which penetrates with joy the whole frame

of nature. So stirred, the individual forgets himself completely. It is the same

Dionysian power which in medieval Germany drove ever increasing crowds

of people singing and dancing from place to place; we recognize in these St.

John's and St. Vitus' dancers the Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, who had

their precursors in Asia Minor and as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic

Sacaea. There are people who, either from lack of experience or out of sheer

stupidity, turn away from such phenomena, and, strong in the sense of their

own  sanity,  label  them  either  mockingly  or  pityingly  "endemic  diseases."

These  benighted  souls  have  no  idea  how  cadaverous  and  ghostly  their

"sanity"  appears  as  the  intense  throng  of  Dionysian  revelers  sweeps  past

them.

  Not only does the bond between man and man come to be forged once

more by the magic of the Dionysian rite, but nature itself, long alienated or

subjugated, rises again to celebrate the reconciliation with her prodigal son,

man. The earth offers its gifts voluntarily, and the savage beasts of mountain

and  desert  approach  in  peace.  The  chariot  of  Dionysus  is  bedecked  with

flowers and garlands; panthers and tigers stride beneath his yoke. If one were

to convert Beethoven's "Paean to Joy" into a painting, and refuse to curb the

imagination when that multitude prostrates itself reverently in the dust, one

might form some apprehension of Dionysian ritual. Now the slave emerges as

a freeman; all the rigid, hostile walls which either necessity or despotism has

erected between men are shattered. Now that the gospel of universal harmony

is sounded, each individual becomes not only reconciled to his fellow but

actually at one with him--as though the veil of Maya had been torn apart and

there remained only shreds floating before the vision of mystical Oneness.

Man now expresses himself through song and dance as the member of a

higher community; he has forgotten how to walk, how to speak, and is on the

brink  of  taking  wing  as  he  dances.  Each  of  his  gestures  betokens

enchantment;  through  him  sounds  a  supernatural  power,  the  same  power

which makes the animals speak and the earth render up milk and honey.

  He  feels  himself  to  be  godlike  and  strides  with  the  same  elation  and

ecstasy as the gods he has seen in his dreams. No longer the artist, he has

himself become a work of art: the productive power of the whole universe is

now manifest in his transport, to the glorious satisfaction of the primordial

One. The finest clay, the most precious marble--man--is here kneaded and

hewn, and the chisel blows of the Dionysian world artist are accompanied bythe  cry  of  the  Eleusinian  mystagogues:  "Do  you  fall  on  your  knees,

multitudes, do you divine your creator?"

  2

  So  far  we  have  examined  the  Apollinian  and  Dionysian  states  as  the

product of formative forces arising directly from nature without the mediation

of the human artist. At this stage artistic urges are satisfied directly, on the

one  hand  through  the  imagery  of  dreams,  whose  perfection  is  quite

independent  of  the  intellectual  rank,  the  artistic  development  of  the

individual; on the other hand, through an ecstatic reality which once again

takes no account of the individual and may even destroy him, or else redeem

him  through  a  mystical  experience  of  the  collective.  In  relation  to  these

immediate  creative  conditions  of  nature  every  artist  must  appear  as

"imitator,"  either  as  the  Apollinian  dream  artist  or  the  Dionysian  ecstatic

artist, or, finally (as in Greek tragedy, for example) as dream and ecstatic

artist in one. We might picture to ourselves how the last of these, in a state of

Dionysian intoxication and mystical self-abrogation, wandering apart from

the reveling throng, sinks upon the ground, and how there is then revealed to

him his own condition--complete oneness with the essence of the universe--in

a dream similitude.

    Having set down these general premises and distinctions, we now turn to

the Greeks in order to realize to what degree the formative forces of nature

were developed in them. Such an inquiry will enable us to assess properly the

relation of the Greek artist to his prototypes or, to use Aristotle's expression,

his "imitation of nature." Of the dreams the Greeks dreamed it is not possible

to speak with any certainty, despite the extant dream literature and the large

number of dream anecdotes. But considering the incredible accuracy of their

eyes, their keen and unabashed delight in colors, one can hardly be wrong in

assuming  that  their  dreams  too  showed  a  strict  consequence  of  lines  and

contours, hues and groupings, a progression of scenes similar to their best bas

reliefs.  The  perfection  of  these  dream  scenes  might  almost  tempt  us  to

consider the dreaming Greek as a Homer and Homer as a dreaming Greek;

which would be as though the modern man were to compare himself in his

dreaming to Shakespeare.

  Yet there is another point about which we do not have to conjecture at all:

I mean the profound gap separating the Dionysian Greeks from the Dionysian

barbarians. Throughout the range of ancient civilization (leaving the newer

civilizations out of account for the moment) we find evidence of Dionysiancelebrations which stand to the Greek type in much the same relation as the

bearded satyr, whose name and attributes are derived from the goat, stands to

the  god  Dionysus.  The  central  concern  of  such  celebrations  was,  almost

universally,  a  complete  sexual  promiscuity  overriding  every  form  of

established tribal law; all the savage urges of the mind were unleashed on

those occasions until they reached that paroxysm of lust and cruelty which

has always struck me as the "witches' cauldron" par excellence. It would

appear that the Greeks were for a while quite immune from these feverish

excesses which must have reached them by every known land or sea route.

What kept Greece safe was the proud, imposing image of Apollo, who in

holding up the head of the Gorgon to those brutal and grotesque Dionysian

forces subdued them. Doric art has immortalized Apollo's majestic rejection

of all license. But resistance became difficult, even impossible, as soon as

similar urges began to break forth from the deep substratum of Hellenism

itself. Soon the function of the Delphic god developed into something quite

different and much more limited: all he could hope to accomplish now was to

wrest the destructive weapon, by a timely gesture of pacification, from his

opponent's hand. That act of pacification represents the most important event

in the history of Greek ritual; every department of life now shows symptoms

of a revolutionary change. The two great antagonists have been reconciled.

Each feels obliged henceforth to keep to his bounds, each will honor the other

by the bestowal of periodic gifts, while the cleavage remains fundamentally

the same. And yet, if we examine what happened to the Dionysian powers

under the pressure of that treaty we notice a great difference: in the place of

the Babylonian Sacaea, with their throwback of men to the condition of apes

and  tigers,  we  now  see  entirely  new  rites  celebrated:  rites  of  universal

redemption, of glorious transfiguration. Only now has it become possible to

speak  of  nature's  celebrating  an  aesthetic  triumph;  only  now  has  the

abrogation of the principium individuationis become an aesthetic event. That

terrible witches' brew concocted of lust and cruelty has lost all power under

the new conditions. Yet the peculiar blending of emotions in the heart of the

Dionysian reveler--his ambiguity if you will--seems still to hark back (as the

medicinal  drug  harks  back  to  the  deadly  poison)  to  the  days  when  the

infliction of pain was experienced as joy while a sense of supreme triumph

elicited cries of anguish from the heart. For now in every exuberant joy there

is heard an undertone of terror, or else a wistful lament over an irrecoverable

loss. It is as though in these Greek festivals a sentimental trait of nature werecoming  to  the  fore,  as  though  nature  were  bemoaning  the  fact  of  her

fragmentation, her decomposition into separate individuals. The chants and

gestures of these revelers, so ambiguous in their motivation, represented an

absolute novum in the world of the Homeric Greeks; their Dionysian music,

in especial, spread abroad terror and a deep shudder. It is true: music had

long been familiar to the Greeks as an Apollinian art, as a regular beat like

that of waves lapping the shore, a plastic rhythm expressly developed for the

portrayal of Apollinian conditions. Apollo's music was a Doric architecture of

sound--of barely hinted sounds such as are proper to the cithara. Those very

elements  which  characterize  Dionysian  music  and,  after  it,  music  quite

generally: the heart shaking power of tone, the uniform stream of melody, the

incomparable resources of harmony--all those elements had been carefully

kept  at  a  distance  as  being  inconsonant  with  the  Apollinian  norm.  In  the

Dionysian dithyramb man is incited to strain his symbolic faculties to the

utmost; something quite unheard of is now clamoring to be heard: the desire

to tear asunder the veil of Maya, to sink back into the original oneness of

nature; the desire to express the very essence of nature symbolically. Thus an

entirely  new  set  of  symbols  springs  into  being.  First,  all  the  symbols

pertaining  to  physical  features:  mouth,  face,  the  spoken  word,  the  dance

movement which coordinates the limbs and bends them to its rhythm. Then

suddenly  all  the  rest  of  the  symbolic  forces--music  and  rhythm  as  such,

dynamics,  harmony--assert  themselves  with  great  energy.  In  order  to

comprehend this total emancipation of all the symbolic powers one must have

reached the same measure of inner freedom those powers themselves were

making manifest; which is to say that the votary of Dionysus could not be

understood except by his own kind. It is not difficult to imagine the awed

surprise with which the Apollinian Greek must have looked on him. And that

surprise would be further increased as the latter realized, with a shudder, that

all this was not so alien to him after all, that his Apollinian consciousness was

but a thin veil hiding from him the whole Dionysian realm.

  3

  In order to comprehend this we must take down the elaborate edifice of

Apollinian culture stone by stone until we discover its foundations. At first

the eye is struck by the marvelous shapes of the Olympian gods who stand

upon  its  pediments,  and  whose  exploits,  in  shining  bas-relief,  adorn  its

friezes. The fact that among them we find Apollo as one god among many,

making no claim to a privileged position, should not mislead us. The samedrive that found its most complete representation in Apollo generated the

whole Olympian world, and in this sense we may consider Apollo the father

of that world. But what was the radical need out of which that illustrious

society of Olympian beings sprang?

  Whoever approaches the Olympians with a different religion in his heart,

seeking moral elevation, sanctity, spirituality, loving kindness, will presently

be forced to turn away from them in ill-humored disappointment. Nothing in

these  deities  reminds  us  of  asceticism,  high  intellect,  or  duty:  we  are

confronted by luxuriant, triumphant existence, which deifies the good and the

bad  indifferently.  And  the  beholder  may  find  himself  dismayed  in  the

presence of such overflowing life and ask himself what potion these heady

people must have drunk in order to behold, in whatever direction they looked,

Helen laughing back at them, the beguiling image of their own existence. But

we shall call out to this beholder, who has already turned his back: Don't go!

Listen first to what the Greeks themselves have to say of this life, which

spreads itself before you with such puzzling serenity. An old legend has it

that  King  Midas  hunted  a  long  time  in  the  woods  for  the  wise  Silenus,

companion  of  Dionysus,  without  being  able  to  catch  him.  When  he  had

finally caught him the king asked him what he considered man's greatest

good. The daemon remained sullen and uncommunicative until finally, forced

by  the  king,  he  broke  into  a  shrill  laugh  and  spoke:  "Ephemeral  wretch,

begotten by accident and toil, why do you force me to tell you what it would

be  your  greatest  boon  not  to  hear?  What  would  be  best  for  you  is  quite

beyond your reach: not to have been born, not to be, to be nothing. But the

second best is to die soon."

  What is the relation of the Olympian gods to this popular wisdom? It is

that of the entranced vision of the martyr to his torment.

  Now the Olympian magic mountain opens itself before us, showing us its

very  roots.  The  Greeks  were  keenly  aware  of  the  terrors  and  horrors  of

existence; in order to be able to live at all they had to place before them the

shining fantasy of the Olympians. Their tremendous distrust of the titanic

forces of nature: Moira, mercilessly enthroned beyond the knowable world;

the vulture which fed upon the great philanthropist Prometheus; the terrible

lot drawn by wise Oedipus; the curse on the house of Atreus which brought

Orestes to the murder of his mother: that whole Panic philosophy, in short,

with  its  mythic  examples,  by  which  the  gloomy  Etruscans  perished,  the

Greeks conquered--or at least hid from view--again and again by means ofthis artificial Olympus. In order to live at all the Greeks had to construct these

deities.  The  Apollinian  need  for  beauty  had  to  develop  the  Olympian

hierarchy of joy by slow degrees from the original titanic hierarchy of terror,

as roses are seen to break from a thorny thicket. How else could life have

been borne by a race so hypersensitive, so emotionally intense, so equipped

for suffering? The same drive which called art into being as a completion and

consummation of existence, and as a guarantee of further existence, gave rise

also  to  that  Olympian  realm  which  acted  as  a  transfiguring  mirror  to  the

Hellenic will. The gods justified human life by living it themselves--the only

satisfactory theodicy ever invented. To exist in the clear sunlight of such

deities was now felt to be the highest good, and the only real grief suffered by

Homeric man was inspired by the thought of leaving that sunlight, especially

when the departure seemed imminent. Now it became possible to stand the

wisdom of Silenus on its head and proclaim that it was the worst evil for man

to die soon, and second worst for him to die at all. Such laments as arise now

arise over short-lived Achilles, over the generations ephemeral as leaves, the

decline of the heroic age. It is not unbecoming to even the greatest hero to

yearn for an afterlife, though it be as a day laborer. So impetuously, during

the Apollinian phase, does man's will desire to remain on earth, so identified

does he become with existence, that even his lament turns to a song of praise.

  It should have become apparent by now that the harmony with nature

which we late comers regard with such nostalgia, and for which Schiller has

coined  the  cant  term  na�ve,  is  by  no  means  a  simple  and  inevitable

condition to be found at the gateway to every culture, a kind of paradise.

Such  a  belief  could  have  been  endorsed  only  by  a  period  for  which

Rousseau's Emile was an artist and Homer just such an artist nurtured in the

bosom of nature. Whenever we encounter "na�vete" in art, we are face to

face with the ripest fruit of Apollinian culture--which must always triumph

first over titans, kill monsters, and overcome the somber contemplation of

actuality,  the  intense  susceptibility  to  suffering,  by  means  of  illusions

strenuously and zestfully entertained. But how rare are the instances of true

na�vete, of that complete identification with the beauty of appearance! It is

this  achievement  which  makes  Homer  so  magnificent--Homer,  who,  as  a

single individual, stood to Apollinian popular culture in the same relation as

the individual dream artist to the oneiric capacity of a race and of nature

generally. The na�vete of Homer must be viewed as a complete victory of

Apollinian  illusion.  Nature  often  uses  illusions  of  this  sort  in  order  toaccomplish its secret purposes. The true goal is covered over by a phantasm.

We stretch out our hands to the latter, while nature, aided by our deception,

attains the former. In the case of the Greeks it was the will wishing to behold

itself in the work of art, in the transcendence of genius; but in order so to

behold  itself  its  creatures  had  first  to  view  themselves  as  glorious,  to

transpose themselves to a higher sphere, without having that sphere of pure

contemplation either challenge them or upbraid them with insufficiency. It

was in that sphere of beauty that the Greeks saw the Olympians as their

mirror images; it was by means of that aesthetic mirror that the Greek will

opposed  suffering  and  the  somber  wisdom  of  suffering  which  always

accompanies artistic talent. As a monument to its victory stands Homer, the

na�ve artist.

  4

  We can learn something about that na�ve artist through the analogy of

dream. We can imagine the dreamer as he calls out to himself, still caught in

the illusion of his dream and without disturbing it, "This is a dream, and I

want to go on dreaming," and we can infer, on the one hand, that he takes

deep delight in the contemplation of his dream, and, on the other, that he

must have forgotten the day, with its horrible importunity, so to enjoy his

dream. Apollo, the interpreter of dreams, will furnish the clue to what is

happening  here.  Although  of  the  two  halves  of  life--the  waking  and  the

dreaming--the former is generally considered not only the more important but

the only one which is truly lived, I would, at the risk of sounding paradoxical,

propose the opposite view. The more I have come to realize in nature those

omnipotent  formative  tendencies  and,  with  them,  an  intense  longing  for

illusion, the more I feel inclined to the hypothesis that the original Oneness,

the ground of Being, ever suffering and contradictory, time and again has

need of rapt vision and delightful illusion to redeem itself. Since we ourselves

are the very stuff of such illusions, we must view ourselves as the truly non-

existent, that is to say, as a perpetual unfolding in time, space, and causality--

what we label "empiric reality." But if, for the moment, we abstract from our

own reality, viewing our empiric existence, as well as the existence of the

world  at  large,  as  the  idea  of  the  original  Oneness,  produced  anew  each

instant, then our dreams will appear to us as illusions of illusions, hence as a

still higher form of satisfaction of the original desire for illusion. It is for this

reason that the very core of nature takes such a deep delight in the naive artist

and the naive work of art, which likewise is merely the illusion of an illusion.Raphael, himself one of those immortal "naive" artists, in a symbolic canvas

has  illustrated  that  reduction  of  illusion  to  further  illusion  which  is  the

original act of the naive artist and at the same time of all Apollinian culture.

In  the  lower  half  of  his  "Transfiguration,"  through  the  figures  of  the

possessed boy, the despairing bearers, the helpless, terrified disciples, we see

a reflection of original pain, the sole ground of being: "illusion" here is a

reflection of eternal contradiction, begetter of all things. From this illusion

there rises, like the fragrance of ambrosia, a new illusory world, invisible to

those enmeshed in the first: a radiant vision of pure delight, a rapt seeing

through wide open eyes. Here we have, in a great symbol of art, both the fair

world of Apollo and its substratum, the terrible wisdom of Silenus, and we

can  comprehend  intuitively  how  they  mutually  require  one  another.  But

Apollo  appears  to  us  once  again  as  the  apotheosis  of  the  principium

individuationis, in whom the eternal goal of the original Oneness, namely its

redemption through illusion, accomplishes itself. With august gesture the god

shows us how there is need for a whole world of torment in order for the

individual to produce the redemptive vision and to sit quietly in his rocking

rowboat in mid sea, absorbed in contemplation.

  If this apotheosis of individuation is to be read in normative terms, we

may infer that there is one norm only: the individual--or, more precisely, the

observance  of  the  limits  of  the  individual:  sophrosune.  As  a  moral  deity

Apollo demands self-control from his people and, in order to observe such

self-control, a knowledge of self. And so we find that the aesthetic necessity

of beauty is accompanied by the imperatives, "Know thyself," and "Nothing

too much." Conversely, excess and hubris come to be regarded as the hostile

spirits of the non-Apollinian sphere, hence as properties of the pre-Apollinian

era--the age of Titans --and the extra-Apollinian world, that is to say the

world  of  the  barbarians.  It  was  because  of  his  Titanic  love  of  man  that

Prometheus had to be devoured by vultures; it was because of his extravagant

wisdom which succeeded in solving the riddle of the Sphinx that Oedipus had

to be cast into a whirlpool of crime: in this fashion does the Delphic god

interpret the Greek past.

  The effects of the Dionysian spirit struck the Apollinian Greeks as titanic

and barbaric; yet they could not disguise from themselves the fact that they

were essentially akin to chose deposed Titans and heroes. They felt more than

that: their whole existence, with its temperate beauty, rested upon a base of

suffering  and  knowledge  which  had  been  hidden  from  them  until  thereinstatement  of  Dionysus  uncovered  it  once  more.  And  lo  and  behold!

Apollo  found  it  impossible  to  live  without  Dionysus.  The  elements  of

titanism  and  barbarism  fumed  out  to  be  quite  as  fundamental  as  the

Apollinian element. And now let us imagine how the ecstatic sounds of the

Dionysian rites penetrated ever more enticingly into that artificially restrained

and  discreet  world  of  illusion,  how  this  clamor  expressed  the  whole

outrageous  gamut  of  nature--delight,  grief,  knowledge--even  to  the  most

piercing cry; and then let us imagine how the Apollinian artist with his thin,

monotonous harp music must have sounded beside the demoniac chant of the

multitude!  The  muses  presiding  over  the  illusory  arts  paled  before  an  art

which enthusiastically told the truth, and the wisdom of Silenus cried "Woe!"

against  the  serene  Olympians.  The  individual,  with  his  limits  and

moderations, forgot himself in the Dionysian vortex and became oblivious to

the  laws  of  Apollo.  Indiscreet  extravagance  revealed  itself  as  truth,  and

contradiction,  a  delight  born  of  pain,  spoke  out  of  the  bosom  of  nature.

Wherever  the  Dionysian  voice  was  heard,  the  Apollinian  norm  seemed

suspended or destroyed. Yet it is equally true that, in those places where the

first  assault  was  withstood,  the  prestige  and  majesty  of  the  Delphic  god

appeared more rigid and threatening than before. The only way I am able to

view Doric art and the Doric state is as a perpetual military encampment of

the  Apollinian  forces.  An  art  so  defiantly  austere,  so  ringed  about  with

fortifications--an education so military and exacting--a polity so ruthlessly

cruel--could endure only in a continual state of resistance against the titanic

and barbaric menace of Dionysus.

  Up to this point I have developed at some length a theme which was

sounded at the beginning of this essay: how the Dionysian and Apollinian

elements,  in  a  continuous  chain  of  creations,  each  enhancing  the  other,

dominated the Hellenic mind; how from the Iron Age, with its battles of

Titans and its austere popular philosophy, there developed under the aegis of

Apollo the Homeric world of beauty; how this "naive" splendor was then

absorbed once more by the Dionysian torrent, and how, face to face with this

new power, the Apollinian code rigidified into the majesty of Doric art and

contemplation. If the earlier phase of Greek history may justly be broken

down into four major artistic epochs dramatizing the battle between the two

hostile principles, then we must inquire further (lest Doric art appear to us as

the acme and final goal of all these striving tendencies) what was the true end

toward which that evolution moved. And our eyes will come to rest on thesublime and much lauded achievement of the dramatic dithyramb and Attic

tragedy, as the common goal of both urges; whose mysterious marriage, after

long  discord,  ennobled  itself  with  such  a  child,  at  once  Antigone  and

Cassandra.

  We are now approaching the central concern of our inquiry, which has as

its aim an understanding of the Dionysian-Apollinian spirit, or at least an

intuitive  comprehension  of  the  mystery  which  made  this  conjunction

possible. Our first question must be: where in the Greek world is the new

seed  first  to  be  found  which  was  later  to  develop  into  tragedy  and  the

dramatic  dithyramb?  Greek  antiquity  gives  us  a  pictorial  clue  when  it

represents in statues, on cameos, etc., Homer and Archilochus side by side as

ancestors and torchbearers of Greek poetry, in the certainty that only these

two are to be regarded as truly original minds, from whom a stream of fire

flowed onto the entire later Greek world. Homer, the hoary dreamer, caught

in  utter  abstraction,  prototype  of  the  Apollinian  naive  artist,  stares  in

amazement at the passionate head of Archilochus, soldierly servant of the

Muses, knocked about by fortune. All that more recent aesthetics has been

able  to  add  by  way  of  interpretation  is  that  here  the  "objective"  artist  is

confronted by the first "subjective" artist. We find this interpretation of little

use, since to us the subjective artist is simply the bad artist, and since we

demand  above  all,  in  every  genre  and  range  of  art,  a  triumph  over

subjectivity, deliverance from the self, the silencing of every personal will

and desire; since, in fact, we cannot imagine the smallest genuine art work

lacking  objectivity  and  disinterested  contemplation.  For  this  reason  our

aesthetic must first solve the following problem: how is the lyrical poet at all

possible as artist--he who, according to the experience of all times, always

says  "I"  and  recites  to  us  the  entire  chromatic  scale  of  his  passions  and

appetites? It is this Archilochus who most disturbs us, placed there beside

Homer, with the stridor of his hate and mockery, the drunken outbursts of his

desire.  Isn't  he--the  first  artist  to  be  called  subjective--for  that  reason  the

veritable non-artist? How, then, are we to explain the reverence in which he

was held as a poet, the honor done him by the Delphic oracle, that seat of

"objective" art, in a number of very curious sayings?

  Schiller has thrown some light on his own manner of composition by a

psychological  observation  which  seems  inexplicable  to  himself  without,

however, giving him pause. Schiller confessed that, prior to composing, heexperienced not a logically connected series of images but rather a musical

mood. "With me emotion is at the beginning without dear and definite ideas;

those ideas do not arise until later on. A certain musical disposition of mind

comes first, and after follows the poetical idea." If we enlarge on this, taking

into account the most important phenomenon of ancient poetry, by which I

mean  that  union--  nay  identity--everywhere  considered  natural,  between

musician and poet (alongside which our modern poetry appears as the statue

of  a  god  without  a  head),  then  we  may,  on  the  basis  of  the  aesthetics

adumbrated earlier, explain the lyrical poet in the following manner. He is,

first  and  foremost,  a  Dionysian  artist,  become  wholly  identified  with  the

original Oneness, its pain and contradiction, and producing a replica of that

Oneness as music, if music may legitimately be seen as a repetition of the

world;  however,  this  music  becomes  visible  to  him  again,  as  in  a  dream

similitude, through the Apollinian dream influence. That reflection, without

image or idea, of original pain in music, with its redemption through illusion,

now produces a second reflection as a single simile or example. The artist

had abrogated his subjectivity earlier, during the Dionysian phase: the image

which now reveals to him his oneness with the heart of the world is a dream

scene showing forth vividly, together with original pain, the original delight

of illusion. The "I" thus sounds out of the depth of being; what recent writers

on aesthetics speak of as "subjectivity" is a mere figment. When Archilochus,

the first lyric poet of the Greeks, hurls both his frantic love and his contempt

at the daughters of Lycambes, it is not his own passion that we see dancing

before us in an orgiastic frenzy: we see Dionysus and the maenads, we see

the drunken reveler Archilochus, sunk down in sleep--as Euripides describes

him for us in the Bacchae, asleep on a high mountain meadow, in the midday

sun--and now Apollo approaches him and touches him with his laurel. The

sleeper's enchantment through Dionysian music now begins to emit sparks of

imagery, poems which, at their point of highest evolution, will bear the name

of tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs.

  The sculptor, as well as his brother, the epic poet, is committed to the

pure contemplation of images. The Dionysian musician, himself imageless, is

nothing but original pain and reverberation of the image. Out of this mystical

process of un-selving, the poet's spirit feels a whole world of images and

similitudes arise, which are quite different in hue, causality, and pace from

the images of the sculptor or narrative poet. While the last lives in those

images,  and  only  in  them,  with  joyful  complacence,  and  never  tires  ofscanning them down to the most minute features, while even the image of

angry Achilles is no more for him than an image whose irate countenance he

enjoys  with  a  dreamer's  delight  in  appearance--so  that  this  mirror  of

appearance protects him from complete fusion with his characters--the lyrical

poet,  on  the  other  hand,  himself  becomes  his  images,  his  images  are

objectified versions of himself. Being the active center of that world he may

boldly speak in the first person, only his "I" is not that of the actual waking

man, but the "I" dwelling, truly and eternally, in the ground of being. It is

through the reflections of that "I" that the lyric poet beholds the ground of

being.  Let  us  imagine,  next,  how  he  views  himself  too  among  these

reflections--as  non-genius,  that  is,  as  his  own  subject  matter,  the  whole

teeming crowd of his passions and intentions directed toward a definite goal;

and when it now appears as though the poet and the nonpoet joined to him

were one, and as though the former were using the pronoun "I," we are able

to see through this appearance, which has deceived those who have attached

the  label  "subjective"  to  the  lyrical  poet.  The  man  Archilochus,  with  his

passionate loves and hates, is really only a vision of genius, a genius who is

no longer merely Archilochus but the genius of the universe, expressing its

pain through the similitude of Archilochus the man. Archilochus, on the other

hand, the subjectively willing and desiring human being, can never be a poet.

Nor is it at all necessary for the poet to see only the phenomenon of the man

Archilochus before him as a reflection of Eternal Being: the world of tragedy

shows us to what extent the vision of the poet can remove itself from the

urgent, immediate phenomenon.

    Schopenhauer, who was fully aware of the difficulties the lyrical poet

creates for the speculative aesthetician, thought that he had found a solution,

which,  however,  I  cannot  endorse.  It  is  true  that  he  alone  possessed  the

means, in his profound philosophy of music, for solving this problem; and I

think I have honored his achievement in these pages, I hope in his own spirit.

Yet  in  the  first  part  of  The  World  as  Will  and  Idea  he  characterizes  the

essence of song as follows: "The consciousness of the singer is filled with the

subject of will, which is to say with his own willing. That willing may either

be  a  released,  satisfied  willing  (joy),  or,  as  happens  more  commonly,  an

inhibited willing (sadness). In either case there is affect here: passion, violent

commotion.  At  the  same  time,  however,  the  singer  is  moved  by  the

contemplation of nature surrounding him to experience himself as the subject

of pure, unwilling ideation, and the unshakable tranquillity of that ideationbecomes contrasted with the urgency of his willing, its limits, and its lacks. It

is the experience of this contrast, or tug of war, which he expresses in his

song.  While  we  find  ourselves  in  the  lyrical  condition,  pure  ideation

approaches us, as it were, to deliver us from the urgencies of willing; we

obey, yet obey for moments only. Again and again our willing, our memory

of  personal  objectives,  distracts  us  from  tranquil  contemplation,  while,

conversely, the next scene of beauty we behold will yield us up once more to

pure  ideation.  For  this  reason  we  find  in  song  and  in  the  lyrical  mood  a

curious  mixture  of  willing  (our  personal  interest  in  purposes)  and  pure

contemplation  (whose  subject  matter  is  furnished  by  our  surroundings);

relations are sought and imagined between these two sets of experiences.

Subjective  mood--the  affection  of  the  will--communicates  its  color  to  the

purely viewed surroundings, and vice versa. All authentic song reflects a state

of mind mixed and divided in this manner."

  Who can fail to perceive in this description that lyric poetry is presented

as an art never completely realized, indeed a hybrid whose essence is made to

consist in an uneasy mixture of will and contemplation, i.e., the aesthetic and

the non-aesthetic conditions. We, on our part, maintain that the distinction

between subjective and objective, which even Schopenhauer still uses as a

sort  of  measuring  stick  to  distinguish  the  arts,  has  no  value  whatever  in

aesthetics; the reason being that the subject--the striving individual bent on

furthering his egoistic purposes--can be thought of only as an enemy to art,

never as its source. But to the extent that the subject is an artist he is already

delivered from individual will and has become a medium through which the

True Subject celebrates His redemption in illusion. For better or worse, one

thing should be quite obvious to all of us: the entire comedy of art is not

played for our own sakes--for our betterment or education, say--nor can we

consider ourselves the true originators of that art realm; while on the other

hand we have every right to view ourselves as aesthetic projections of the

veritable creator and derive such dignity as we possess from our status as art

works. Only as an aesthetic product can the world be justified to all eternity--

although our consciousness of our own significance does scarcely exceed the

consciousness a painted soldier might have of the battle in which he takes

part. Thus our whole knowledge of art is at bottom illusory, seeing that as

mere knowers we can never be fused with that essential spirit, at the same

time creator and spectator, who has prepared the comedy of art for his own

edification. Only as the genius in the act of creation merges with the primalarchitect of the cosmos can he truly know something of the eternal essence of

art. For in that condition he resembles the uncanny fairy tale image which is

able to see itself by turning its eyes. He is at once subject and object, poet,

actor, and audience.

    Scholarship has discovered in respect of Archilochus that he introduced

folk song into literature, and that it was this feat which earned him the unique

distinction of being placed beside Homer. Yet what does folk song represent

in contrast to epic poetry, which is wholly Apollinian? Surely the classical

instance  of  a  union  between  Apollinian  and  Dionysian  intentions.  Its

tremendous  distribution,  as  well  as  its  constant  proliferation  wherever  we

look, attests the strength of that dual generative motive in nature: a motive

which leaves its traces in folk song much the way the orgiastic movements of

a nation leave their traces in music. Nor should it be difficult to show by

historical evidence that every period which abounded in folk songs has, by

the same token, been deeply stirred by Dionysian currents. Those currents

have long been considered the necessary substratum, or precondition, of folk

poetry.

  But  first  of  all  we  must  regard  folk  song  as  a  musical  mirror  of  the

cosmos, as primordial melody casting about for an analogue and finding that

analogue eventually in poetry. Since melody precedes all else, it may have to

undergo any number of objectifications, such as a variety of texts presents.

But it is always, according to the naive estimation of the populace, much

superior in importance to those texts. Melody gives birth to poetry again and

again: this is implied by the atrophic form of folk song. for a long time I

wondered at this phenomenon, until finally the following explanation offered

itself. If we examine any collection of folk poetry--for example, Des Knaben

Wunderhorn--in  this  light,  we  shall  find  countless  examples  of  melody

generating  whole  series  of  images,  and  those  images,  in  their  varicolored

hues, abrupt transitions, and headlong forward rush, stand in the most marked

contrast to the equable movement, the calm illusion, of epic verse. Viewed

from the standpoint of the epic the uneven and irregular imagery of folk song

becomes  quite  objectionable.  Such  must  have  been  the  feeling  which  the

solemn  rhapsodists  of  the  Apollinian  rites,  during  the  age  of  Terpander,

entertained with regard to popular lyric effusions.

  In folk poetry we find, moreover, the most intense effort of language to

imitate the condition of music. For this reason Archilochus may be claimed tohave ushered in an entirely new world of poetry, profoundly at variance with

the  Homeric;  and  by  this  distinction  we  have  hinted  at  the  only  possible

relation between poetry and music, word and sound. Word, image, and idea,

in undergoing the power of music, now seek for a kind of expression that

would parallel it. In this sense we may distinguish two main currents in the

history of Greek verse, according as language is used to imitate the world of

appearance or that of music. To understand more profoundly the significance

of this distinction, let the reader ponder the utter dissimilarity of verbal color,

syntax and phraseology in the works of Homer and Pindar. He then cannot

fail to conjecture that in the interval there must have sounded the orgiastic

flute notes of Olympus, which, as late as Aristotle's time, in the midst of an

infinitely  more  complex  music,  still  rouses  men  to  wild  enthusiasm,  and

which at their inception must have challenged all contemporaries to imitate

them by every available poetic resource. I wish to instance in this connection

a well-known phenomenon of our own era which our modish aestheticians

consider  most  exceptionable.  We  have  noticed  again  and  again  how  a

Beethoven symphony compels the individual hearers to use pictorial speech--

though  it  must  be  granted  that  a  collocation  of  these  various  descriptive

sequences might appear rather checkered, fantastic, even contradictory. Small

wonder, then, that our critics have exercised their feeble wit on these musical

images, or else passed over the phenomenon--surely one worthy of further

investigation--in complete silence. Even in cases where the composer himself

has employed pictorial tags in talking about his work-- calling one symphony

"Pastoral," one movement "Brook Scene" and another "Jolly Concourse of

Peasants"--these  tropes  are  properly  reducible  to  purely  musical  elements

rather than standing for actual objects expressed through music. It is true that

such  musical  representations  can  neither  instruct  us  much  concerning  the

Dionysian  content  of  music  nor  yet  lay  claim  to  any  distinctive  value  as

images.  But  once  we  study  this  discharge  of  music  through  images  in  a

youthful milieu, among a people whose linguistic creativity is unimpaired,

we can form some idea of how atrophic folk song must have arisen and how a

nation's entire store of verbal resources might be mobilized by means of that

novel principle, imitation of the language of music.

  If we are right in viewing lyric poetry as an efflorescence of music in

images and ideas, then our next question will be, "How does music manifest

itself in that mirror of images and ideas?" It manifests itself as will, using the

term in Schopenhauer's sense, that is to say as the opposite of the aesthetic,contemplative, unwilling disposition. At this point it becomes necessary to

discriminate very clearly between essence and appearance--for it is obviously

impossible for music to represent the essential nature of the will; if it did, we

would have to banish it from the realm of art altogether, seeing that the will is

the non-aesthetic element par excellence. Rather we should say that music

appears as the will. In order to express that appearance through images the

lyrical poet must employ the whole register of emotions, from the whisper of

love to the roar of frenzy; moved by the urge to talk of music in Apollinian

similitudes, he must first comprehend the whole range of nature, including

himself, as the eternal source of volition, desire, appetite. But to the extent

that he interprets music through images he is dwelling on the still sea of

Apollinian  contemplation,  no  matter  how  turbulently  all  that  he  beholds

through the musical medium may surge about him. And when he looks at

himself through that medium he will discover his own image in a state of

turmoil:  his  own  willing  and  desiring,  his  groans  and  jubilations,  will  all

appear  to  him  as  a  similitude  by  which  music  is  interpreted.  Such  is  the

phenomenon  of  the  lyric  poet.  Being  an  Apollinian  genius,  he  interprets

music through the image of the will, while he is himself turned into the pure,

unshadowed eye of the sun, utterly detached from the will and its greed.

    Throughout this inquiry I have maintained the position that lyric poetry is

dependent on the spirit of music to the same degree that music itself, in its

absolute sovereignty, is independent of either image or concept, though it

may  tolerate  both.  The  poet  cannot  tell  us  anything  that  was  not  already

contained, with a most universal validity, in such music as prompted him to

his figurative discourse. The cosmic symbolism of music resists any adequate

treatment  by  language,  for  the  simple  reason  that  music,  in  referring  to

primordial contradiction and pain, symbolizes a sphere which is both earlier

than  appearance  and  beyond  it.  Once  we  set  it  over  against  music,  all

appearance becomes a mere analogy. So it happens that language, the organ

and symbol of appearance, can never succeed in bringing the innermost core

of  music  to  the  surface.  Whenever  it  engages  in  the  imitation  of  music,

language  remains  in  purely  superficial  contact  with  it,  and  no  amount  of

poetic eloquence will carry us a step closer to the essential secret of that art.

  7

  At  this  point  we  need  to  call  upon  every  aesthetic  principle  so  far

discussed, in order to find our way through the labyrinthine origins of Greek

tragedy. I believe I am saying nothing extravagant when I claim that theproblem of these origins has never even been posed, much less solved, no

matter how often the elusive rags of ancient tradition have been speculatively

sewn together and ripped apart That tradition tells us in no uncertain terms

that tragedy arose out of the tragic chorus and was, to begin with, nothing but

chorus. We are thus bound to scan the chorus closely as the archetypal drama,

disregarding the current explanations of it as the idealized spectator, or as

representing the populace over against the noble realm of the set. The latter

interpretation,  which  sounds  so  grandly  edifying  to  certain  politicians  (as

though the democratic Athenians had represented in the popular chorus the

invariable moral law, always right in face of the passionate misdeeds and

extravagances of kings) may have been suggested by a phrase in Aristotle,

but  this  lofty  notion  can  have  had  no  influence  whatever  on  the  original

formation of tragedy, whose purely religious origins would exclude not only

the opposition between the people and their rulers but any kind of political or

social context. Likewise we would consider it blasphemous, in the light of the

classical form of the chorus as we know it from Aeschylus and Sophocles, to

speak of a "foreshadowing' of constitutional democracy, though others have

not stuck at such blasphemy. No ancient polity ever embodied constitutional

democracy,  and  one  dares  to  hope  that  ancient  tragedy  did  not  even

foreshadow it.

  Much more famous than this political explanation of the chorus is the

notion  of  A.  W.  Schlegel,  who  advises  us  to  regard  the  chorus  as  the

quintessence of the audience, as the "ideal spectator." If we hold this view

against  the  historical  tradition  according  to  which  tragedy  was,  in  the

beginning, nothing but chorus, it turns out to be a crude, unscholarly, though

dazzling  hypothesis--dazzling  because  of  the  effective  formulation,  the

typically  German  bias  for  anything  called  "ideal,"  and  our  momentary

wonder  at  the  notion.  For  we  are  indeed  amazed  when  we  compare  our

familiar theater audience with the tragic chorus and ask ourselves whether the

former could conceivably be construed into something analogous to the latter.

We tacitly deny the possibility, and then are brought to wonder both at the

boldness  of  Schlegel's  assertion  and  at  what  must  have  been  the  totally

different complexion of the Greek audience. We had supposed all along that

the spectator, whoever he might be, would always have to remain conscious

of the fact that he had before him a work of art, not empiric reality, whereas

the tragic chorus of the Greeks is constrained to view the characters enacted

on the stage as veritably existing. The chorus of the Oceanides think that theybehold the actual Titan Prometheus, and believe themselves every bit as real

as the god. Are we seriously to assume that the highest and purest type of

spectator is he who, like the Oceanides, regards the god as physically present

and real? That it is characteristic of the ideal spectator to rush on stage and

deliver the god from his fetters? We had put our faith in an artistic audience,

believing  that  the  more  intelligent  the  individual  spectator  was,  the  more

capable he was of viewing the work of art as art; and now Schlegel's theory

suggests to us that the perfect spectator viewed the world of the stage not at

all as art but as reality. "Oh these Greeks!" we moan. "They upset our entire

aesthetic!" But once we have grown accustomed to it, we repeat Schlegel's

pronouncement whenever the question of the chorus comes up.

  The emphatic tradition I spoke of militates against Schlegel: chorus as

such, without stage--the primitive form of tragedy--is incompatible with that

chorus of ideal spectators. What sort of artistic genre would it be that derived

from the idea of the spectator and crystallized itself in the mode of the "pure"

spectator? A spectator with out drama is an absurdity. We suspect that the

birth of tragedy can be explained neither by any reverence for the moral

intelligence of the multitude nor by the notion of a spectator without drama,

and, altogether, we consider the problem much too complex to be touched by

such facile interpretations.

  An infinitely more valuable insight into the significance of the chorus was

furnished by Schiller in the famous preface to his Bride of Messina, where

the chorus is seen as a living wall which tragedy draws about itself in order to

achieve insulation from the actual world, to preserve its ideal ground and its

poetic freedom.

  Schiller  used  this  view  as  his  main  weapon  against  commonplace

naturalism,  against  the  illusionistic  demand  made  upon  dramatic  poetry.

While the day of the stage was conceded to be artificial, the architecture of

the set symbolic, the metrical discourse stylized, a larger misconception still

prevailed. Schiller was not content to have what constitutes the very essence

of poetry merely tolerated as poetic license. He insisted that the introduction

of the chorus was the decisive step by which any naturalism in art was openly

challenged. This way of looking at art seems to me the one which our present

age, thinking itself so superior, has labeled pseudo idealism. But I very much

fear that we, with our idolatry of verisimilitude, have arrived at the opposite

pole of all idealism, the realm of the waxworks. This too betrays a kind of art,

as do certain popular novels of today. All I ask is that we not be importunedby  the  pretense  that  such  art  has  left  Goethe's  and  Schiller's  "pseudo-

idealism" behind.

  It is certainly true, as Schiller saw, that the Greek chorus of satyrs, the

chorus of primitive tragedy, moved on ideal ground, a ground raised high

above the common path of mortals. The Greek has built for his chow he

scaffolding  of  a  fictive  chthonic  realm  and  placed  thereon  fictive  nature

spirits. Tragedy developed on this foundation, and so has been exempt since

its beginning from the embarrassing task of copying actuality. All the same,

the world of tragedy is by no means a world arbitrarily projected between

heaven and earth; rather it is a world having the same reality and credibility

as  Olympus  possessed  for  the  devout  Greek.  The  satyr,  as  the  Dionysian

chorist, dwells in a reality sanctioned by myth and ritual. That tragedy should

begin with him, that the Dionysian wisdom of tragedy should speak through

him, is as puzzling a phenomenon as, more generally, the origin of tragedy

from the chorus. Perhaps we can gain a starting point for this inquiry by

claiming that the satyr, that fictive nature sprite, stands to cultured man in the

same relation as Dionysian music does to civilization. Richard Wagner has

said of the latter that it is absorbed by music as lamplight by daylight. In the

same manner, I believe, the cultured Greek felt himself absorbed into the

satyr chorus, and in the next development of Greek tragedy state and society,

in fact all that separated man from man, gave way before an overwhelming

sense of unity which led back into the heart of nature. The metaphysical

solace (with which, I wish to say at once, all true tragedy sends us away) that,

despite every phenomenal change life is at bottom indestructibly joyful and

powerful,  was  expressed  most  concretely  in  the  chorus  of  satyrs,  nature

beings who dwell behind all civilization and preserve their identity through

every change of generations and historical movement.

  With  this  chorus  the  profound  Greek,  so  uniquely  susceptible  to  the

subtlest and deepest suffering, who had penetrated the destructive agencies of

both nature and history, solaced himself. Though he had been in danger of

craving a Buddhistic denial of the will, he was saved by art, and through art

life reclaimed him.

  While the transport of the Dionysian state, with its suspension of all the

ordinary barriers of existence, lasts, it carries with it a Lethean element in

which everything that has been experienced by the individual is drowned.

This chasm of oblivion separates the quotidian reality from the Dionysian.

But as soon as that quotidian reality enters consciousness once more it isviewed with loathing, and the consequence is an ascetic, abulic state of mind.

In this sense Dionysian man might be said to resemble Hamlet: both have

looked deeply into the true nature of things, they have gained knowledge and

are  now  loath  to  act.  They  realize  that  no  action  of  theirs  can  work  any

change in the eternal condition of things, and they regard the imputation as

ludicrous or debasing that they should set right the time which is out of joint.

Knowledge kills action, for in order to act we require the veil of illusion; such

is Hamlet's doctrine, not to be confounded with the cheap wisdom of Jack the

Dreamer,  who  through  too  much  reflection,  as  it  were  a  surplus  of

possibilities, never arrives at action. What, both in the case of Hamlet and of

Dionysian man, overbalances any motive leading to action, is not reflection

but knowledge, the apprehension of truth and its terror. Now no comfort any

longer avails, desire reaches beyond the transcendental world, beyond the

gods themselves, and existence, together with its glittering reflection in the

gods and an immortal Beyond, is denied. The truth once seen, man is aware

everywhere  of  the  ghastly  absurdity  of  existence,  comprehends  the

symbolism  of  Ophelia's  fate  and  the  wisdom  of  the  wood  sprite  Silenus:

nausea invades him.

  Then, in this supreme jeopardy of the will, art, that sorceress expert in

healing,  approaches  him;  only  she  can  turn  his  fits  of  nausea  into

imaginations with which it is possible to live. These are on the one hand the

spirit of the sublime, which subjugates terror by means of art; on the other

hand the comic spirit, which releases us, through art, from the tedium of

absurdity. The satyr chorus of the dithyramb was the salvation of Greek art;

the  threatening  paroxysms  I  have  mentioned  were  contained  by  the

intermediary of those Dionysian attendants.

  8

  The satyr and the idyllic shepherd of later times have both been products

of a desire for naturalness and simplicity. But how firmly the Greek shaped

his wood sprite, and how self-consciously and mawkishly the modern dallies

with his tender, fluting shepherd! For the Greek the satyr expressed nature in

a rude, uncultivated state: he did not, for that reason, confound him with the

monkey. Quite the contrary, the satyr was man's true prototype, an expression

of his highest and strongest aspirations. He was an enthusiastic reveler, filled

with transport by the approach of the god; a compassionate companion re

enacting the sufferings of the god; a prophet of wisdom born out of nature's

womb; a symbol of the sexual omnipotence of nature, which the Greek wasaccustomed to view with reverent wonder. The satyr was sublime and divine-

-so he must have looked to the traumatically wounded vision of Dionysian

man. Our tricked out, contrived shepherd would have offended him, but his

eyes rested with sublime satisfaction on the open, undistorted limnings of

nature. Here archetypal man was cleansed of the illusion of culture, and what

revealed itself was authentic man, the bearded satyr jubilantly greeting his

god. Before him cultured man dwindled to a false cartoon. Schiller is also

correct as regards these beginnings of the tragic art: the chorus is a living wall

against the onset of reality because it depicts reality more truthfully and more

completely  than  does  civilized  man,  who  ordinarily  considers  himself  the

only reality. Poetry does not lie outside the world as a fantastic impossibility

begotten of the poet's brain; it seeks to be the exact opposite, an unvarnished

expression of truth, and for this reason must cast away the trumpery garments

worn by the supposed reality of civilized man. The contrast between this truth

of nature and the pretentious lie of civilization is quite similar to that between

the eternal core of things and the entire phenomenal world. Even as tragedy,

with its metaphysical solace, points to the eternity of true being surviving

every phenomenal change, so does the symbolism of the satyr chorus express

analogically  the  primordial  relation  between  the  thing  in  itself  and

appearance. The idyllic shepherd of modern man is but a replica of the sum

of  cultural  illusions  which  he  mistakes  for  nature.  The  Dionysian  Greek,

desiring truth and nature at their highest power, sees himself metamorphosed

into the satyr.

  Such are the dispositions and insights of the reveling throng of Dionysus;

and the power of these dispositions and insights transforms them in their own

eyes,  until  they  behold  themselves  restored  to  the  condition  of  genii,  of

satyrs. Later the tragic chorus came to be an aesthetic imitation of that natural

phenomenon;  which  then  necessitated  a  distinction  between  Dionysian

spectators and votaries actually spellbound by the god. What must be kept in

mind  in  all  these  investigations  is  that  the  audience  of  Attic  tragedy

discovered itself in the chorus of the orchestra. Audience and chorus were

never fundamentally set over against each other: all was one grand chorus of

dancing, singing satyrs, and of those who let themselves be represented by

them. This granted, Schlegel's dictum assumes a profounder meaning. The

chorus is the "ideal spectator" inasmuch as it is the only seer--seer of the

visionary world of the proscenium. An audience of spectators, such as we

know it, was unknown to the Greeks. Given the terraced structure of theGreek theater, rising in concentric arcs, each spectator could quite literally

survey  the  entire  cultural  world  about  him  and  imagine  himself,  in  the

fullness of seeing, as a chorist. Thus we are enabled to view the chorus of

primitive  proto-tragedy  as  the  projected  image  of  Dionysian  man.  The

clearest illustration of this phenomenon is the experience of the actor, who, if

he is truly gifted, has before his eyes the vivid image of the role he is to play.

The satyr chorus is, above all, a vision of the Dionysian multitude, just as the

world of the stage is a vision of that satyr chorus--a vision so powerful that it

blurs the actors' sense of the "reality" of cultured spectators ranged row on

row about him. The structure of the Greek theater reminds us of a lonely

mountain valley: the architecture of the stage resembles a luminous cloud

configuration  which  the  Bacchae  behold  as  they  swarm  down  from  the

mountaintops; a marvelous frame in the center of which Dionysus manifests

himself to them.

  Our  scholarly  ideas  of  elementary  artistic  process  are  likely  to  be

offended by the primitive events which I have adduced here to explain the

tragic chorus. And yet nothing can be more evident than the fact that the poet

is poet only insofar as he sees himself surrounded by living acting shapes into

whose innermost being he penetrates. It is our peculiar modem weakness to

see all primitive aesthetic phenomena in too complicated and abstract a way.

Metaphor, for the authentic poet, is not a figure of rhetoric a representative

image standing concretely before him in lieu of a concept. A character, to

him, is not an assemblage of individual traits laboriously pieced together, but

a personage beheld as insistently living before his eyes, differing from the

image of the painter only in its capacity to continue living and acting. What is

it that makes Homer so much more vivid and concrete in his description than

any other poet? His lively eye, with which he discerns so much more. We all

talk about poetry so abstractly because we all tend to be indifferent poets. At

bottom the aesthetic phenomenon is quite simple: all one needs in order to be

a poet is the ability to have a lively action going on before one continually, to

live surrounded by hosts of spirits. To be a dramatist all one needs is the urge

to transform oneself and speak out of strange bodies and souls.

  Dionysian excitation is capable of communicating to a whole multitude

this artistic power to feel itself surrounded by, and one with, a host of spirits.

What happens in the dramatic chorus is the primary dramatic phenomenon:

projecting oneself outside oneself and then acting as though one had really

entered another body, another character. This constitutes the first step in theevolution of drama. This art is no longer that of the rhapsodist, who does not

merge with his images but, like the painter, contemplates them as something

outside himself; what we have here is the individual effacing himself through

entering a strange being. It should be made clear that this phenomenon is not

singular but epidemic: a whole crowd becomes rapt in this manner. It is for

this  reason  that  the  dithyramb  differs  essentially  from  any  other  kind  of

chorus. The virgins who, carrying laurel branches and singing a processional

chant, move solemnly toward the temple of Apollo, retain their identities and

their civic names. The dithyrambic chorus on the other hand is a chorus of the

transformed, who have forgotten their civic past and social rank, who have

become timeless servants of their god and live outside all social spheres.

While  all  the  other  types  of  Greek  choric  verse  are  simply  the  highest

intensification  of  the  Apollinian  musician,  in  the  dithyramb  we  see  a

community of unconscious actors all of whom see one another as enchanted.

    Enchantment is the precondition of all dramatic art. In this enchantment

the Dionysian reveler sees himself as satyr, and as satyr, in turn, he sees the

god.  In  his  transformation  he  sees  a  new  vision,  which  is  the  Apollinian

completion of his state. And by the same token this new vision completes the

dramatic act.

  Thus we have come to interpret Greek tragedy as a Dionysian chorus

which again and again discharges itself in Apollinian images. Those choric

portions with which the tragedy is interlaced constitute, as it were, the matrix

of the dialogue, that is to say, of the entire stage-world of the actual drama.

This substratum of tragedy irradiates, in several consecutive discharges, the

vision of the drama--a vision on the one hand completely of the nature of

Apollinian dream-illusion and therefore epic, but on the other hand, as the

objectification of a Dionysian condition, tending toward the shattering of the

individual and his fusion with the original Oneness. Tragedy is an Apollinian

embodiment of Dionysian insights and powers, and for that reason separated

by a tremendous gulf from the epic.

  On this view the chorus of Greek tragedy, symbol of an entire multitude

agitated  by  Dionysus,  can  be  fully  explained.  Whereas  we  who  are

accustomed to the role of the chorus in modem theater, especially opera, find

it hard to conceive how the chorus of the Greeks should have been older,

more  central  than  the  dramatic  action  proper  (although  we  have  clear

testimony  to  this  effect)  and  whereas  we  have  never  been  quite  able  to

reconcile  with  this  position  of  importance  the  fact  that  the  chorus  wascomposed of such lowly beings as--originally--goatlike satyrs; and whereas,

further, the orchestra in front of the stage has always seemed a riddle to us--

we now realize that the stage with its action was originally conceived as pure

vision and that the only reality was the chorus, who created that vision out of

itself and proclaimed it through the medium of dance, music, and spoken

word. Since, in this vision, the chorus beholds its lord and master Dionysus, it

remains  forever  an  attending  chorus,  it  sees  how  the  god  suffers  and

transforms  himself,  and  it  has,  for  that  reason,  no  need  to  act.  But,

notwithstanding its subordination to the god, the chorus remains the highest

expression of nature, and, like nature, utters in its enthusiasm oracular words

of wisdom. Being compassionate as well as wise, it proclaims a truth that

issues from the heart of the world. Thus we see how that fantastic and at first

sight embarrassing figure arises, the wise and enthusiastic satyr who is at the

same time the "simpleton" as opposed to the god. The satyr is a replica of

nature in its strongest tendencies and at the same time, a herald of its wisdom

and art. He combines in his person the roles of musician, poet, dancer and

visionary.

  It is in keeping both with this insight and with general tradition that in the

earliest  tragedy  Dionysus  was  not  actually  present  but  merely  imagined.

Original tragedy is only chorus and not drama at all. Later an attempt was

made  to  demonstrate  the  god  as  real  and  to  bring  the  visionary  figure,

together  with  the  transfiguring  frame,  vividly  before  the  eyes  of  every

spectator. This marks the beginning of drama in the strict sense of the word.

It then became the task of the dithyrambic chorus so to excite the mood of the

listeners  that  when  the  tragic  hero  appeared  they  would  behold  not  the

awkwardly masked man but a figure born of their own rapt vision. If we

imagine Admetus brooding on the memory of his recently departed wife,

consuming himself in a spiritual contemplation of her form, and how a figure

of  similar  shape  and  gait  is  led  toward  him  in  deep  disguise;  if  we  then

imagine his tremor of excitement, his impetuous comparisons, his instinctive

conviction--then  we  have  an  analogue  for  the  excitement  of  the  spectator

beholding the god, with whose sufferings he has already identified himself,

stride onto the stage. Instinctively he would project the shape of the god that

was  magically  present  to  his  mind  onto  that  masked  figure  of  a  man,

dissolving the latter's reality into a ghostly unreality. This is the Apollinian

dream state, in which the daylight world is veiled and a new world--clearer,

more comprehensible, more affecting than the first, and at the same timemore shadowy--falls upon the eye in ever changing shapes. Thus we may

recognize a drastic stylistic opposition: language, color, pace, dynamics of

speech are polarized into the Dionysian poetry of the chorus, on the one hand,

and the Apollinian dream world of the scene on the other. The result is two

completely separate spheres of expression. The Apollinian embodiments in

which  Dionysus  assumes  objective  shape  are  very  different  from  the

continual interplay of shifting forces in the music of the chorus, from those

powers deeply felt by the enthusiast, but which he is incapable of condensing

into a clear image. The adept no longer obscurely senses the approach of the

god: the god now speaks to him from the proscenium with the clarity and

firmness of epic, as an epic hero, almost in the language of Homer.

    Everything that rises to the surface in the Apollinian portion of Greek

tragedy (in the dialogue) looks simple, transparent, beautiful. In this sense the

dialogue  is  a  mirror  of  the  Greek  mind,  whose  nature  manifests  itself  in

dance,  since  in  dance  the  maximum  power  is  only  potentially  present,

betraying itself in the suppleness and opulence of movement. The language

of  the  Sophoclean  heroes  surprises  us  by  its  Apollinian  determinacy  and

lucidity. It seems to us that we can fathom their innermost being, and we are

somewhat surprised that we had such a short way to go. However, once we

abstract from the character of the hero as it rises to the surface and becomes

visible (a character at bottom no more than a luminous shape projected onto a

dark  wall,  that  is  to  say,  appearance  through  and  through)  and  instead

penetrate into the myth which is projected in these luminous reflections, we

suddenly come up against a phenomenon which is the exact opposite of a

familiar optical one. After an energetic attempt to focus on the sun we have,

by way of remedy almost, dark spots before our eyes when we turn away.

Conversely, the luminous images of the Sophoclean heroes--those Apollinian

masks--are the necessary productions of a deep look into the horror of nature;

luminous spots, as it were, designed to cure an eye hurt by the ghastly night.

Only in this way can we form an adequate notion of the seriousness of Greek

"serenity"; whereas we find that serenity generally misinterpreted nowadays

as a condition of undisturbed complacence.

  Sophocles conceived doomed Oedipus the greatest sufferer of the Greek

stage,  as  a  pattern  of  nobility,  destined  to  error  and  misery  despite  his

wisdom, yet exercising a beneficent influence upon his environment in virtue

of his boundless grief. The profound poet tells us that a man who is trulynoble is incapable of sin; though every law, every natural order, indeed the

entire canon of ethics, perish by his actions, those very actions will create a

circle of higher consequences able to found a new world on the ruins of the

old. This is the poet's message, insofar as he is at the same time a religious

thinker.  In  his  capacity  as  poet  he  presents  us  in  the  beginning  with  a

complicated  legal  knot  in  the  slow  unraveling  of  which  the  judge  brings

about  his  own  destruction.  The  typically  Greek  delight  in  this  dialectical

solution is so great that it imparts an element of triumphant serenity to the

work, and thus removes the sting lurking in the ghastly premises of the plot.

In Oedipus at Colonus we meet this same serenity, but utterly transfigured. In

contrast  to  the  aged  hero,  stricken  with  excess  of  grief  and  passively

undergoing  his  many  misfortunes,  we  have  here  a  transcendent  serenity

issuing from above and hinting that by his passive endurance the hero may

yet gain a consummate energy of action. This activity (so different from his

earlier conscious striving, which had resulted in pure passivity) will extend

far beyond the limited experience of his own life. Thus the legal knot of the

Oedipus  fable,  which  had  seemed  to  mortal  eyes  incapable  of  being

disentangled,  is  slowly  loosened.  And  we  experience  the  most  profound

human  joy  as  we  witness  this  divine  counterpart  of  dialectics.  If  this

explanation has done the poet justice, it may yet be asked whether it has

exhausted the implications of the myth; and now we see that the poet's entire

conception was nothing more nor less than the luminous afterimage which

kind nature provides our eyes after a look into the abyss. Oedipus, his father's

murderer,  his  mother's  lover,  solver  of  the  Sphinx's  riddle!  What  is  the

meaning of this triple fate? An ancient popular belief, especially strong in

Persia, holds that a wise magus must be incestuously begotten. If we examine

Oedipus, the solver of riddles and liberator of his mother, in the light of this

Parsee  belief,  we  may  conclude  that  wherever  soothsaying  and  magical

powers  have  broken  the  spell  of  present  and  future,  the  rigid  law  of

individuation, the magic circle of nature, extreme unnaturalness--in this case

incest--is the necessary antecedent; for how should man force nature to yield

up her secrets but by successfully resisting her, that is to say, by unnatural

acts? This is the recognition I find expressed in the terrible triad of Oedipean

fates: the same man who solved the riddle of nature (the ambiguous Sphinx)

must also, as murderer of his father and husband of his mother, break the

consecrated tables of the natural order. It is as though the myth whispered to

us that wisdom, and especially Dionysian wisdom, is an unnatural crime, andthat  whoever,  in  pride  of  knowledge,  hurls  nature  into  the  abyss  of

destruction,  must  himself  experience  nature's  disintegration.  "The  edge  of

wisdom is turned against the wise man; wisdom is a crime committed on

nature": such are the terrible words addressed to us by myth. Yet the Greek

poet, like a sunbeam, touches the terrible and austere Memnon's Column of

myth, which proceeds to give forth Sophoclean melodies. Now I wish to

contrast  to  the  glory  of  passivity  the  glory  of  action,  as  it  irradiates  the

Prometheus  of  Aeschylus.  Young  Goethe  has  revealed  to  us,  in  the  bold

words his Prometheus addresses to Zeus, what the thinker Aeschylus meant

to say, but what, as poet, he merely gave us to divine in symbol:

  Here l sit, forming men

  in my own image,

  a race to be like me,

  to suffer, to weep,

  to delight and to rejoice,

  and to defy you,

  as I do.

  Man,  raised  to  titanic  proportions,  conquers  his  own  civilization  and

compels the gods to join forces with him, since by his autonomous wisdom

he commands both their existence and the limitations of their sway. What

appears  most  wonderful,  however,  in  the  Prometheus  poem--ostensibly  a

hymn in praise of impiety--is its profound Aeschylean longing for justice.

The immense suffering of the bold individual, on the one hand, and on the

other the extreme jeopardy of the gods, prefiguring a "twilight of the gods"--

the two together pointing to a reconciliation, a merger of their universes of

suffering--all  this  reminds  one  vividly  of  the  central  tenet  of  Aeschylean

speculation in which Moira, as eternal justice, is seen enthroned above men

and  gods  alike.  In  considering  the  extraordinary  boldness  with  which

Aeschylus  places  the  Olympian  world  on  his  scales  of  justice,  we  must

remember  that  the  profound  Greek  had  an  absolutely  stable  basis  of

metaphysical thought in his mystery cults and that he was free to discharge

all his skeptical velleities on the Olympians. The Greek artist, especially,

experienced  in--respect  of  these  divinities  an  obscure  sense  of  mutual

dependency,  a  feeling  which  has  been  perfectly  symbolized  in  the

Prometheus of Aeschylus. The titanic artist was strong in his defiant belief

that he could create men and, at the least, destroy Olympian gods; this he was

able to do by virtue of his superior wisdom, which, to be sure, he must atonefor by eternal suffering. The glorious power to do, which is possessed by

great genius, and for which even eternal suffering is not too high a price to

pay--the artist's austere pride--is of the very essence of Aeschylean poetry,

while  Sophocles  in  his  Oedipus  intones  a  paean  to  the  saint.  But  even

Aeschylus' interpretation of the myth fails to exhaust its extraordinary depth

of terror. Once again, we may see the artist's buoyancy and creative joy as a

luminous cloud shape reflected upon the dark surface of a lake of sorrow.

The legend of Prometheus is indigenous to the entire community of Aryan

races and attests to their prevailing talent for profound and tragic vision. In

fact,  it  is  not  improbable  that  this  myth  has  the  same  characteristic

importance for the Aryan mind as the myth of the Fall has for the Semitic,

and that the two myths are related as brother and sister. The presupposition of

the Prometheus myth is primitive man's belief in the supreme value of fire as

the true palladium of every rising civilization. But for man to dispose of fire

freely, and not receive it as a gift from heaven in the kindling thunderbolt and

the  warming  sunlight,  seemed  a  crime  to  thoughtful  primitive  man,  a

despoiling of divine nature. Thus this original philosophical problem poses at

once an insoluble conflict between men and the gods, which lies like a huge

boulder at the gateway to every culture. Man's highest good must be bought

with  a  crime  and  paid  for  by  the  flood  of  grief  and  suffering  which  the

offended  divinities  visit  upon  the  human  race  in  its  noble  ambition.  An

austere  notion,  this,  which  by  the  dignity  it  confers  on  crime  presents  a

strange  contrast  to  the  Semitic  myth  of  the  Fall--a  myth  that  exhibits

curiosity, deception, suggestibility, concupiscence, in short a whole series of

principally feminine frailties, as the root of all evil. What distinguishes the

Aryan  conception  is  an  exalted  notion  of  active  sin  as  the  properly

Promethean  virtue;  this  notion  provides  us  with  the  ethical  substratum  of

pessimistic tragedy, which comes to be seen as a justification of human ills,

that is to say of human guilt as well as the suffering purchased by that guilt.

The tragedy at the heart of things, which the thoughtful Aryan is not disposed

to quibble away, the contrariety at the center of the universe, is seen by him

as an interpenetration of several worlds, as for instance a divine and a human,

each  individually  in  the  right  but  each,  as  it  encroaches  upon  the  other,

having to suffer for its individuality. The individual, in the course of his

heroic striving towards universality, de-individuation, comes up against that

primordial  contradiction  and  learns  both  to  sin  and  to  suffer.  The  Aryan

nations assign to crime the male, the Semites to sin the female gender; and itis quite consistent with these notions that the original act of hubris should be

attributed to a man, original sin to a woman. For the rest, perhaps not too

much should be made of this distinction, cf. the chorus of wizards in Goethe's

Faust:

  If that is so, we do not mind it:

  With a thousand steps the women find it;

  But though they rush, we do not care:

  With one big jump the men get there.

  [Goethe's Faust, lines 3982-85.]

  Once we have comprehended the substance of the Prometheus myth--the

imperative necessity of hubris for the titanic individual--we must realize the

non-Apollinian  character  of  this  pessimistic  idea.  It  is  Apollo  who

tranquilizes the individual by drawing boundary lines, and who, by enjoining

again and again the practice of self-knowledge, reminds him of the holy,

universal  norms.  But  lest  the  Apollinian  tendency  freeze  all  form  into

Egyptian rigidity, and in attempting to prescribe its orbit to each particular

wave inhibit the movement of the lake, the Dionysian flood tide periodically

destroys  all  the  little  circles  in  which  the  Apollinian  will  would  confine

Hellenism.  The  swiftly  rising  Dionysian  tide  then  shoulders  all  the  small

individual  wave  crests,  even  as  Prometheus'  brother,  the  Titan  Atlas,

shouldered the world. This titanic urge to be the Atlas of all individuals, to

bear them on broad shoulders ever farther and higher, is the common bond

between  the  Promethean  and  the  Dionysian  forces.  In  this  respect  the

Aeschylean  Prometheus  appears  as  a  Dionysian  mask,  while  in  his  deep

hunger for justice Aeschylus reveals his paternal descent from Apollo, god of

individuation and just boundaries. We may express the Janus face, at once

Dionysian and Apollinian, of the Aeschylean Prometheus in the following

formula: "All that exists is just and unjust and equally justified in both."

  That is your world! A world indeed!-- [Goethe's Faust, line 409.]

  It is an unimpeachable tradition that in its earliest form Greek tragedy

records only the sufferings of Dionysus, and that he was the only actor. But it

may be claimed with equal justice that, up to Euripides, Dionysus remains the

sole dramatic protagonist and that all the famous characters of the Greek

stage, Prometheus, Oedipus, etc., are only masks of that original hero. The

fact that a god hides behind all these masks accounts for the much-admired

"ideal" character of those celebrated figures. Someone, I can't recall who, hasclaimed that all individuals, as individuals, are comic, and therefore untragic;

which seems to suggest that the Greeks did not tolerate individuals at all on

the  tragic  stage.  And  in  fact  they  must  have  felt  this  way.  The  Platonic

distinction between the idea and the eidolon ["idol"] is deemed rooted in the

Greek temperament If we wished to use Plato's terminology we might speak

of the tragic characters of the Greek stage somewhat as follows: the one true

Dionysus appears in a multiplicity of characters, in the mask of warrior hero,

and enmeshed in the web of individual will. The god ascends the stage in the

likeness of a striving and suffering individual. That he can appear at all with

this clarity and precision is due to dream interpreter Apollo, who projects

before the chorus its Dionysian condition in this analogical figure. Yet in

truth that hero is the suffering Dionysus of the mysteries. He of whom the

wonderful myth relates that as a child he was dismembered by Titans now

experiences  in  his  own  person  the  pains  of  individuation,  and  in  this

condition  is  worshipped  as  Zagreus.  We  have  here  an  indication  that

dismemberment--the truly Dionysian suffering--was like a separation into air,

water, earth, and fire, and that individuation should be regarded as the source

of all suffering, and rejected. The smile of this Dionysus has given birth to

the Olympian gods, his tears have given birth to men. In his existence as a

dismembered  god,  Dionysus  shows  the  double  nature  of  a  cruel,  savage

daemon  and  a  mild,  gentle  ruler.  Every  hope  of  the  Eleusinian  initiates

pointed to a rebirth of Dionysus, which we can now interpret as meaning the

end of individuation; the thundering paean of the adepts addressed itself to

the coming of the third Dionysus. This hope alone sheds a beam of joy on a

ravaged  and  fragmented  world--as  is  shown  by  the  myth  of  sorrowing

Demeter, who rejoiced only when she was told that she might once again

bear  Dionysus.  In  these  notions  we  already  find  all  the  components  of  a

profound  and  mystic  philosophy  and,  by  the  same  token,  of  the  mystery

doctrine of tragedy; a recognition that whatever exists is of a piece, and that

individuation is the root of all evil; a conception of art as the sanguine hope

that the spell of individuation may yet be broken. as an augury of eventual

reintegration.

  I have said earlier that the Homeric epic was the poetic expression of

Olympian  culture,  its  victory  song  over  the  terrors  of  the  battle  with  the

Titans. Now, under the overmastering influence of tragic poetry, the Homeric

myths were once more transformed and by this metempsychosis proved that

in the interim Olympian culture too had been superseded by an even deeperphilosophy.  The  contumacious  Titan,  Prometheus,  now  announced  to  his

Olympian tormentor that unless the latter promptly joined forces with him,

his  reign  would  be  in  supreme  danger.  In  the  work  of  Aeschylus  we

recognize the alliance of the Titan with a frightened Zeus in terror of his end.

Thus  we  find  the  earlier  age  of  Titans  brought  back  from  Tartarus  and

restored to the light of day. A philosophy of wild, naked nature looks with the

bold countenance of truth upon the flitting myths of the Homeric world: they

pale and tremble before the lightning eye of this goddess, until the mighty fist

of the Dionysian artist forces them into the service of a new divinity. The

Dionysian truth appropriates the entire realm of myth as symbolic language

for its own insights, which it expresses partly in the public rite of tragedy and

partly in the secret celebrations of dramatic mysteries, but always under the

old  mythic  veil.  What  was  the  power  that  rescued  Prometheus  from  his

vultures and transformed myth into a vehicle of Dionysian wisdom? It was

the Heraclean power of music, which reached its highest form in tragedy and

endowed myth with a new and profound significance. Such, as we have said

earlier, is the mighty prerogative of music. For it is the lot of every myth to

creep gradually into the narrows of supposititious historical fact and to be

treated by some later time as a unique event of history. And the Greeks at that

time were already well on their way to reinterpreting their childhood dream,

cleverly and arbitrarily, into pragmatic childhood history. It is the sure sign of

the death of a religion when its mythic presuppositions become systematized,

under the severe, rational eyes of an orthodox dogmatism, into a ready sum of

historical events, and when people begin timidly defending the veracity of

myth but at the same time resist its natural continuance--when the feeling for

myth  withers  and  its  place  is  taken  by  a  religion  claiming  historical

foundations. This decaying myth was now seized by the newborn genius of

Dionysian music, in whose hands it fiowered once more, with new colors and

a fragrance that aroused a wistful longing for a metaphysical world. After this

last florescence myth declined, its leaves withered, and before long all the

ironic Lucians of antiquity caught at the faded blossoms whirled away by the

wind. It was through tragedy that myth achieved its profoundest content, its

most expressive form; it arose once again like a wounded warrior, its eyes

alight with unspent power and the calm wisdom of the dying.

  What were you thinking of, overweening Euripides, when you hoped to

press  myth,  then  in  its  last  agony,  into  your  service?  It  died  under  your

violent hands; but you could easily put in its place an imitation that, likeHeracles' monkey, would trick itself out in the master's robes. And even as

myth, music too died under your hands; though you plundered greedily all the

gardens of music, you could achieve no more than a counterfeit. And because

you had deserted Dionysus. vou were in turn deserted by Apollo. Though you

hunted all the passions up from their couch and conjured them into your

circle,  though  you  pointed  and  burnished  a  sophistic  dialectic  for  the

speeches  of  your  heroes,  they  have  only  counterfeit  passions  and  speak

counterfeit speeches.

  Greek tragedy perished in a manner quite different from the older sister

arts: it died by suicide, in consequence of an insoluble confiict, while the

others died serene and natural deaths at advanced ages. If it is the sign of a

happy natural condition to die painlessly, leaving behind a fair progeny, then

the decease of those older genres exhibits such a condition; they sank slowly,

and their children, fairer than they, stood before their dying eyes, lifting up

their  heads  in  eagerness.  The  death  of  Greek  tragedy,  on  the  other  hand,

created a tremendous vacuum that was felt far and wide. As the Greek sailors

in the time of Tiberius heard from a lonely island the agonizing cry "Great

Pan is dead!" so could be heard ringing now through the entire Greek world

these painful cries: "Tragedy is dead! And poetry has perished with it! Away

with you, puny, spiritless imitators! Away with you to Hades, where you may

eat your fill of the crumbs thrown you by former masters!"

  When after all a new genre sprang into being which honored tragedy as

its parent, the child was seen with dismay to bear indeed the features of its

mother, but of its mother during her long death struggle. The death struggle

of tragedy had been fought by Euripides, while the later art is known as the

New Attic comedy. Tragedy lived on there in a degenerate form, a monument

to its painful and laborious death.

  In this context we can understand the passionate fondness of the writers

of  the  new  comedy  for  Euripides.  Now  the  wish  of  Philemon--who  was

willing  to  be  hanged  for  the  pleasure  of  visiting  Euripides  in  Hades,

providing he could be sure that the dead man was still in possession of his

senses--no longer seems strange to us. If one were to attempt to say briefly

and  merely  by  way  of  suggestion  what  Menander  and  Philemon  had  in

common with Euripides, and what they found so exemplary and exciting in

him, one might say that Euripides succeeded in transporting the spectator

onto  the  stage.  Once  we  realize  out  of  what  substance  the  Prometheandramatists before Euripides had formed their heroes and how far it had been

from their thoughts to bring onto the stage a true replica of actuality, we shall

see clearly how utterly different were Euripides' intentions. Through him the

common man found his way from the auditorium onto the stage. That mirror,

which previously had shown only the great and bold features, now took on

the kind of accuracy that reflects also the paltry traits of nature. Odysseus, the

typical Greek of older art, declined under the hands of the new poets to the

character of Graeculus, who henceforth held the center of the stage as the

good humored, cunning slave. The merit which Euripides, in Aristophanes'

Frogs, attributes to himself, of having by his nostrum rid tragic art of its

pompous embonpoint, is apparent in every one of his tragic heroes. Now

every spectator could behold his exact counterpart on the Euripidean stage

and was delighted to find him so eloquent. But that was not the only pleasure.

People themselves learned to speak from Euripides--don't we hear him boast,

in his contest with Aeschylus, that through him the populace had learned to

observe, make transactions and form conclusions according to all the rules of

art,  with  the  utmost  cleverness?  It  was  through  this  revolution  in  public

discourse  that  the  new  comedy  became  possible.  From  now  on  the  stock

phrases to represent everyday affairs were ready to hand. While hitherto the

character of dramatic speech had been determined by the demigod in tragedy

and  the  drunken  satyr  in  comedy,  that  bourgeois  mediocrity  in  which

Euripides placed all his political hopes now came to the fore. And so the

Aristophanic Euripides could pride himself on having portrayed life "as it

really  is"  and  shown  men  how  to  attack  it:  if  now  all  members  of  the

populace were able to philosophize, plead their cases in court and make their

business deals with incredible shrewdness, the merit was really his, the result

of that wisdom he had inculcated in them.

  The  new  comedy  could  now  address  itself  to  a  prepared,  enlightened

crowd, for whom Euripides had served as choirmaster--only in this case it

was the chorus of spectators who had to be trained. As soon as this chorus

had  acquired  a  competence  in  the  Euripidean  key,  the  new  comedy--that

chesslike  species  of  play--with  its  constant  triumphs  of  cleverness  and

cunning, arose. Meanwhile choirmaster Euripides was the object of fulsome

praise; in fact, people would have killed themselves in order to learn more

from him had they not known that the tragic poets were quite as dead as

tragedy  itself.  With  tragedy  the  Greeks  had  given  up  the  belief  in

immortality: not only the belief in an ideal past, but also the belief in an idealfuture. The words of the famous epitaph "Inconstant and frivolous in old age"

apply equally well to the last phase of Hellenism. Its supreme deities are wit,

whim, caprice, the pleasure of the moment. The fifth estate, that of the slaves,

comes into its own, at least in point of attitude, and if it is possible at all now

to speak of Greek serenity, then it must refer to the serenity of the slave, who

has no difficult responsibilities, no high aims, and to whom nothing, past or

future, is of greater value than the present. It was this semblance of Greek

serenity that so outraged the profound and powerful minds of the first four

centuries after Christ. This womanish escape from all seriousness and awe,

this smug embracing of easy pleasure, seemed to them not only contemptible

but the truly antiChristian frame of mind. It was they who handed on to later

generations a picture of Greek antiquity painted entirely in the pale rose hues

of serenity--as though there had never been a sixth century with its birth of

tragedy, its Mysteries, its Pythagoras and Heracleitus, indeed as though the

art works of the great period did not exist at all. And yet none of the latter

could, of course, have sprung from the soil of such a trivial ignoble cheer,

pointing as they do to an entirely different philosophy as their raison d'etre.

  When I said earlier that Euripides had brought the spectator on the stage

in order to enable him to judge the play, I may have created the impression

that the older drama had all along stood in a false relation to the spectator;

and  one  might  then  be  tempted  to  praise  Euripides'  radical  tendency  to

establish a proper relationship between art work and audience as an advance

upon  Sophocles.  But,  after  all,  audience  is  but  a  word,  not  a  constant

unchanging  value.  Why  should  an  author  feel  obliged  to  accommodate

himself to a power whose strength is merely in numbers? If he considers

himself superior in his talent and intentions to every single spectator, why

should he show respect for the collective expression of all those mediocre

capacities  rather  than  for  the  few  members  of  the  audience  who  seem

relatively the most gifted? The truth of the matter is that no Greek artist ever

treated his audience with greater audacity and self sulliciency than Euripides;

who at a time when the multitude lay prostrate before him disavowed in

noble defiance and publicly his own tendencies--those very tendencies by

which  he  had  previously  conquered  the  masses.  Had  this  genius  had  the

slightest reverence for that band of Bedlamites called the public, he would

have  been  struck  down  long  before  the  mid  point  of  his  career  by  the

bludgeon blows of his unsuccess. We come to realize now that our statement,

"Euripides brought the spectator on the stage"--implying that the spectatorwould  be  able  henceforth  to  exercise  competent  judgment  --was  merely

provisional and that we must look for a sounder explanation of his intentions.

It  is  also  generally  recognized  that  Aeschylus  and  Sophocles  enjoyed  all

through their lives and longer the full benefit of popular favor, and that for

this  reason  it  would  be  absurd  to  speak  in  either  case  of  a  disproportion

between art work and public reception. What was it, then, that drove the

highly talented and incessantly creative Euripides from a path bathed in the

light of those twin luminaries--his great predecessors--and of popular acclaim

as well? What peculiar consideration for the spectator made him defy that

very same spectator? How did it happen that his great respect for his audience

made him treat that audience with utter disrespect?

    Euripides--and this may be the solution of our riddle-- considered himself

quite superior to the crowd as a whole; not, however, to two of his spectators.

He  would  translate  the  crowd  onto  the  stage  but  insist,  all  the  same,  on

revering the two members as the sole judges of his art; on following all their

directions  and  admonitions,  and  on  instilling  in  the  very  hearts  of  his

dramatic  characters  those  emotions,  passions  and  recognitions  which  had

heretofore  seconded  the  stage  action,  like  an  invisible  chorus,  from  the

serried ranks of the amphitheater. It was in deference to these judges that he

gave his new characters a new voice, too, and a new music. Their votes, and

no others, determined for him the worth of his efforts. And whenever the

public rejected his labors it was their encouragement, their faith in his final

triumph, which sustained him.

  One  of  the  two  spectators  I  just  spoke  of  was  Euripides  himself--the

thinker Euripides, not the poet. Of him it may be said that the extraordinary

richness of his critical gift had helped to produce, as in the case of Lessing,

an authentic creative offshoot. Endowed with such talent, such remarkable

intellectual lucidity and versatility, Euripides watched the performances of

his predecessors' plays and tried to rediscover in them those fine lineaments

which age, as happens in the case of old paintings, had darkened and almost

obliterated. And now something occurred which cannot surprise those among

us who are familiar with the deeper secrets of Aeschylean tragedy. Euripides

perceived in every line, in every trait, something quite incommensurable: a

certain deceptive clarity and, together with it, a mysterious depth, an infinite

background. The clearest figure trailed after it a comet's tail which seemed to

point to something uncertain, something that could not be wholly elucidated.

A similar twilight seemed to invest the very structure of drama, especially thefunction of the chorus. Then again, how ambiguous did the solutions of all

moral problems seem! how problematical the way in which the myths were

treated! how irregular the distribution of fortune and misfortune! There was

also much in the language of older tragedy that he took exception to, or to say

the least, found puzzling: why all this pomp in the representation of simple

relationships?  why  all  those  tropes  and  hyperboles,  where  the  characters

themselves  were  simple  and  straightforward?  Euripides  sat  in  the  theater

pondering, a troubled spectator. In the end he had to admit to himself that he

did not understand his great predecessors. But since he looked upon reason as

the  fountainhead  of  all  doing  and  enjoying,  he  had  to  find  out  whether

anybody shared these notions of his, or whether he was alone in facing up to

such incommensurable features. But the multitude, including some of the best

individuals, gave him only a smile of distrust; none of them would tell him

why, notwithstanding his misgivings and reservations, the great masters were

right nonetheless. In this tormented state of mind, Euripides discovered his

second spectator--one who did not understand tragedy and for that reason

spumed it. Allied with him he could risk coming out of his isolation to fight

that tremendous battle against the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles; not by

means of polemics, but as a tragic poet determined to make his notion of

tragedy prevail over the traditional notions.

  12

  Before giving a name to that other spectator, let us stop a moment and

call to mind what we have said earlier of the incommensurable and discrepant

elements  in  Aeschylean  tragedy.  Let  us  recollect  how  strangely  we  were

affected by the chorus and by the tragic hero of a kind of tragedy which

refused to conform to either our habits or our tradition--until, that is, we

discovered that the discrepancy was closely bound up with the very origin

and essence of Greek tragedy, as the expression of two interacting artistic

impulses, the Apollinian and the Dionysian. Euripides' basic intention now

becomes as clear as day to us: it is to eliminate from tragedy the primitive

and pervasive Dionysian element, and to rebuild the drama on a foundation of

non-Dionysian art, custom and philosophy.

  Euripides himself, towards the end of his life, propounded the question of

the value and sign)ficance of this tendency to his contemporaries in a myth.

Has the Dionysian spirit any right at all to exist? Should it not, rather, be

brutally uprooted from the Hellenic soil? Yes, it should, the poet tells us, if

only it were possible, but the god Dionysus is too powerful: even the mostintelligent opponent, like Pentheus in the Bacchae, is unexpectedly enchanted

by him, and in his enchantment runs headlong to destruction. The opinion of

the two old men in the play--Cadmus and Tiresias--seems to echo the opinion

of the aged poet himself: that the cleverest individual cannot by his reasoning

overturn an ancient popular tradition like the worship of Dionysus, and that it

is the proper part of diplomacy in the face of miraculous powers to make at

least a prudent show of sympathy; that it is even possible that the god may

still take exception to such tepid interest and--as happened in the case of

Cadmus--turn the diplomat into a dragon. We are told this by a poet who all

his  life  had  resisted  Dionysus  heroically,  only  to  end  his  career  with  a

glorification  of  his  opponent  and  with  suicide--like  a  man  who  throws

himself from a tower in order to put an end to the unbearable sensation of

vertigo.  The  Bacchae  acknowledges  the  failure  of  Euripides'  dramatic

intentions when, in fact, these had already succeeded: Dionysus had already

been driven from the tragic stage by a daemonic power speaking through

Euripides. For in a certain sense Euripides was but a mask, while the divinity

which spoke through him was neither Dionysus nor Apollo but a brand new

daemon  called  Socrates.  Thenceforward  the  real  antagonism  was  to  be

between Dionysian spirit and the Socratic, and tragedy was to perish in the

conflict. Try as he may to comfort us with his recantation, Euripides fails.

The marvelous temple lies in ruins; of what avail is the destroyer's lament

that  it  was  the  most  beautiful  of  all  temples?  And  though,  by  way  of

punishment, Euripides has been turned into a dragon by all later critics, who

can really regard this as adequate compensation?

  Let us now look more closely at the Socratic tendency by means of which

Euripides fought and conquered Aeschylean tragedy. What, under the most

auspicious conditions, could Euripides have hoped to effect in founding his

tragedy on purely un-Dionysian elements? Once it was no longer begotten by

music,  in  the  mysterious  Dionysian  twilight,  what  form  could  drama

conceivably take? Only that of the dramatized epic, an Apollinian form which

precluded tragic effect. It is not a question here of the events represented. I

submit that it would have been impossible for Goethe, in the fifth act of his

projected Nausic�a, to render tragic the suicide of that idyllic being: the

power  of  the  epic  Apollinian  spirit  is  such  that  it  transfigures  the  most

horrible  deeds  before  our  eyes  by  the  charm  of  illusion,  and  redemption

through  illusion.  The  poet  who  writes  dramatized  narrative  can  no  more

become one with his images than can the epic rhapsodist. He too representsserene, wide eyed contemplation gazing upon its images. The actor in such

dramatized epic remains essentially a rhapsodist; the consecration of dream

lies upon all his actions and prevents him from ever becoming in the full

sense an actor.

  But  what  relationship  can  be  said  to  obtain  between  such  an  ideal

Apollinian drama and the plays of Euripides? The same as obtains between

the early solemn rhapsodist and that more recent variety described in Plato's

Ion: "When I say something sad my eyes fill with tears; if, however, what I

say is terrible and ghastly, then my hair stands on end and my heart beats

loudly." Here there is no longer any trace of epic self forgetfulness, of the

true rhapsodist's cool detachment, who at the highest pitch of action, and

especially then, becomes wholly illusion and delight in illusion. Euripides is

the actor of the beating heart, with hair standing on end. He lays his dramatic

plan as Socratic thinker and carries it out as passionate actor. So it happens

that the Euripidean drama is at the same time cool and fiery, able alike to

freeze and consume us. It cannot possibly achieve the Apollinian effects of

the  epic,  while  on  the  other  hand  it  has  severed  all  connection  with  the

Dionysian mode; so that in order to have any impact at all it must seek out

novel stimulants which are to be found neither in the Apollinian nor in the

Dionysian realm. Those stimulants are, on the one hand, cold paradoxical

ideas put in the place of Apollinian contemplation, and on the other fiery

emotions put in the place of Dionysian transports. These last are splendidly

realistic counterfeits, but neither ideas nor affects are infused with the spirit

of true art.

    Having now recognized that Euripides failed in founding the drama solely

on Apollinian elements and that, instead, his anti Dionysian tendency led him

towards inartistic naturalism, we are ready to deal with the phenomenon of

aesthetic Socratism. Its supreme law may be stated as follows: "Whatever is

to be beautiful must also be sensible" --a parallel to the Socratic notion that

knowledge  alone  makes  men  virtuous.  Armed  with  this  canon,  Euripides

examined  every  aspect  of  drama--diction,  character,  dramatic  structure,

choral music--and made them fit his specifications. What in Euripidean, as

compared with Sophoclean tragedy, has been so frequently censured as poetic

lack  and  retrogression  is  actually  the  straight  result  of  the  poet's  incisive

critical gifts, his audacious personality. The Euripidean prologue may seen to

illustrate the efficacy of that rationalistic method. Nothing could be more at

odds  with  our  dramaturgic  notions  than  the  prologue  in  the  drama  ofEuripides. To have a character appear at the beginning of the play, tell us who

he is, what preceded the action, what has happened so far, even what is about

to happen in the course of the play--a modern writer for the theater would

reject  all  this  as  a  wanton  and  unpardonable  dismissal  of  the  element  of

suspense. Now that everyone knows what is going to happen, who will wait

to see it happen? Especially since, in this case, the relation is by no means

that  of  a  prophetic  dream  to  a  later  event.  But  Euripides  reasoned  quite

otherwise.  According  to  him,  the  effect  of  tragedy  never  resided  in  epic

suspense, in a teasing uncertainty as to what was going to happen next. It

resided, rather, in those great scenes of lyrical rhetoric in which the passion

and  dialectic  of  the  protagonist  reached  heights  of  eloquence.  Everything

portended pathos, not action. Whatever did not portend pathos was seen as

objectionable.  The  greatest  obstacle  to  the  spectator's  most  intimate

participation in those scenes would be any missing link in the antecedent

action: so long as the spectator had to conjecture what this or that figure

represented,  from  whence  arose  this  or  that  conflict  of  inclinations  and

intentions, he could not fully participate in the doings and sufferings of the

protagonists, feel with them and fear with them. The tragedy of Aeschylus

and Sophocles had used the subtlest devices to furnish the spectator in the

early scenes, and as if by chance, with al} the necessary information. They

had shown an admirable skill in disguising the necessary structural features

and making them seem accidental. All the same, Euripides thought he noticed

chat  during  those  early  scenes  the  spectators  were  in  a  peculiar  state  of

unrest--so concerned with figuring out the antecedents of the story chat the

beauty and pathos of the exposition were lost on them. For this reason he

introduced a prologue even before the exposition, and put it into the mouth of

a speaker who would command absolute trust. Very often it was a god who

had to guarantee to the public the course of the tragedy and so remove any

possible doubt as to the reality of the mydh; exactly as Descartes could only

demonstrate the reality of the empirical world by appealing to God's veracity,

his inability to tell a lie. At the end of his drama Euripides required the same

divine  truthfulness  to  act  as  security,  so  to  speak,  for  the  future  of  his

protagonists.  This  was  the  function  of  the  ill-famed  deus  ex  machina.

Between  the  preview  of  the  prologue  and  the  preview  of  the  epilogue

stretched the dramatic lyric present, the drama proper.

  As a poet, then, Euripides was principally concerned with rendering his

conscious  perceptions,  and  it  is  this  which  gives  him  his  position  ofimportance  in  the  history  of  Greek  drama.  With  regard  to  his  poetic

procedure, which was both critical and creative, he must often have felt that

he was applying to drama the opening words of Anaxagoras' treatise: "In the

beginning all things were mixed together; then reason came and introduced

order." And even as Anaxagoras, with his concept of reason, seems like the

first sober philosopher in a company of drunkards, so Euripides may have

appeared to himself as the first rational maker of tragedy. Everything was

mixed  together  in  a  chaotic  stew  so  long  as  reason,  the  sole  principle  of

universal  order,  remained  excluded  from  the  creative  act.  Being  of  this

opinion, Euripides had necessarily to reject his less rational peers. Euripides

would never have endorsed Sophocles' statement about Aeschylus--that this

poet was doing the right thing, but unconsciously; instead he would have

claimed that since Aeschylus created unconsciously he couldn't help doing

the wrong cling. Even the divine Plato speaks of the creative power of the

poet for the most part ironically and as being on a level with the gifts of the

soothsayer  and  interpreter  of  dreams,  since  according  to  the  traditional

conception the poet is unable to write until reason and conscious control have

deserted him. Euripides set out, as Plato was to do, to show the world the

opposite  of  the  "irrational"  poet;  his  aesthetic  axiom,  "whatever  is  to  be

beautiful must be conscious" is strictly parallel to the Socratic "whatever is to

be  good  must  be  conscious."  We  can  hardly  go  wrong  then  in  calling

Euripides the poet of aesthetic Socratism. But Socrates was precisely that

second spectator, incapable of understanding the older tragedy and therefore

scorning it, and it was in his company that Euripides dared to usher in a new

era of poetic activity. If the old tragedy was wrecked' aesthetic Socratism is

to blame, and to the extent that the target of the innovators was the Dionysian

principle of the older art we may call Socrates the god's chief opponent, the

new Orpheus who, though destined to be torn to pieces by the maenads of

Athenian judgment, succeeded in putting the overmastering god to flight. The

latter, as before, when he fled from Lycurgus, king of the Edoni, took refuge

in the depths of the sea; that is to say, in the flood of a mystery cult that was

soon to encompass the world.

  13

  The fact that the aims of Socrates and Euripides were closely allied did

not  escape  the  attention  of  their  contemporaries.  We  have  an  eloquent

illustration of this in the rumotr, current at the time in Athens, that Socrates

was helping Euripides with his writing. The two names were bracketed by thepartisans of the "good old days'? whenever it was a question of castigating

the upstart demagogues of the present. It was they who were blamed for the

disappearance of the Marathonian soundness of body and mind in favor of a

dubious enlightenment tending toward a progressive atrophy of the traditional

virtues. In the comedy of Aristophanes both men are treated in this vein--half

indignant, half contemptuous--to the dismay of the rising generation, who,

while they were willing enough to sacrifice Euripides, could not forgive the

picture of Socrates as the arch Sophist. Their only recourse was to pillory

Aristophanes in his turn as a dissolute, Lying Alcibiades of poetry. I won't

pause here to defend the pro found instincts of Aristophanes against such

attacks but shall proceed to demonstrate the close affinity between Socrates

and Euripides, as their contemporaries saw them. It is certainly significant in

this connection that Socrates, being a sworn enemy of the tragic art, is said

never to have attended the theater except when a new play of Euripides was

mounted. The most famous instance of the conjunction of the two names,

however,  is  found  in  the  Delphic  oracle  which  pronounced  Socrates  the

wisest of men yet allowed that Euripides merited the second place. The third

place went to Sophocles, who had boasted that, in contrast to Aeschylus, he

not only did the right thing but knew why he did it. Evidently it was the

transparency  of  their  knowledge  that  earned  for  these  three  men  the

reputation of true wisdom in their day.

  It was Socrates who expressed most clearly this radically new prestige of

knowledge and conscious intelligence when he claimed to be the only one

who  acknowledged  to  himself  that  he  knew  nothing.  He  roamed  all  over

Athens, visiting the most distinguished statesmen, orators, poets and artists,

and found everywhere merely the presumption of knowledge. He was amazed

to discover that all these celebrities lacked true and certain knowledge of their

callings and pursued those callings by sheer instinct. The expression "sheer

instinct" seems to focus perfectly the Socratic attitude. From this point of

view  Socrates  was  forced  to  condemn  both  the  prevailing  art  and  the

prevailing ethics. Wherever his penetrating gaze fell he saw nothing but lack

of understanding, fictions rampant, and so was led to deduce a state of affairs

wholly discreditable and perverse. Socrates believed it was his mission to

correct  the  situation:  a  solitary  man,  arrogantly  superior  and  herald  of  a

radically dissimilar culture, art, and ethics, he stepped into a world whose

least hem we should have counted it an honor to have touched. This is the

reason why the figure of Socrates disturbs us so profoundly whenever weapproach it, and why we are tempted again and again to plumb the meaning

and intentions of the most problematical character among the ancients. Who

was  this  man  who  dared,  singlehanded,  to  challenge  the  entire  world  of

Hellenism--embodied in Homer, Pindar, and Aeschylus, in Phidias, Pericles,

Pythia,  and  Dionysus--which  commands  our  highest  reverence?  Who  was

this daemon daring to pour out the magic philter in the dust? this demigod to

whom the noblest spirits of mankind must call out:

  Alas!

  You have shattered

  The beautiful world

  With brazen fist;

  It falls, it is scattered.

  [Goethe's Faust, lines 1607-11.]

  We  are  offered  a  key  to  the  mind  of  Socrates  in  that  remarkable

phenomenon  known  as  his  daimonion.  In  certain  critical  situations,  when

even his massive intellect faltered, he was able to regain his balance through

the agency of a divine voice, which he heard only at such moments. The

voice always spoke to dissuade. The instinctual wisdom of this anomalous

character manifests itself from time to time as a purely inhibitory agent, ready

to defy his rational judgment. Whereas in all truly productive men instinct is

the strong, affirmative force and reason the dissuader and critic, in the case of

Socrates  the  roles  are  reversed:  instinct  is  the  critic,  consciousness  the

creator. Truly a monstrosity! Because of this lack of every mystical talent

Socrates  emerges  as  the  perfect  pattern  of  the  non-mystic,  in  whom  the

logical side has become, through superfetation, as overdeveloped as has the

instinctual side in the mystic. Yet it was entirely impossible for Socrates'

logical impetus to turn against itself. In its unrestrained onrush it exhibited an

elemental power such as is commonly found only in men of violent instincts,

where  we  view  it  with  awed  surprise.  Whoever  in  reading  Plato  has

experienced the divine directness and sureness of Socrates' whole way of

proceeding  must  have  a  sense  of  the  gigantic  driving  wheel  of  logical

Socratism,  turning,  as  it  were,  behind  Socrates,  which  we  see  through

Socrates as through a shadow. That he himself was by no means unaware of

this relationship appears from the grave dignity with which he stressed, even

at the end and before his judges, his divine mission. It is as impossible to

controvert him in this as it is to approve of his corrosive influence upon

instinctual life. In this dilemma his accusers, when he was brought before theAthenian forum, could think of one appropriate form of punishment only,

namely exile: to turn this wholly unclassifiable, mysterious phenomenon out

of the state would have given posterity no cause to charge the Athenians with

a  disgraceful  act.  When  finally  death,  not  banishment,  was  pronounced

against  him,  it  seems  to  have  been  Socrates  himself  who,  with  complete

lucidity of mind and in the absence of every natural fear of death, insisted on

it. He went to his death with the same calm Plato describes when he has him

leave the symposium in the early dawn, the last reveler, to begin a new day;

while behind him on the benches and on the floor his sleepy companions go

on dreaming of Socrates, the true lover. Socrates in his death became the idol

of the young Athenian elite. The typical Hellenic youth, Plato, prostrated

himself before that image with all the fervent devotion of his enthusiastic

mind.

  14

  Let us now imagine Socrates' great Cyclops' eye--that eye which never

glowed with the artist's divine frenzy--turned upon tragedy. Bearing in mind

that he was unable to look with any pleasure into the Dionysian abysses, what

could  Socrates  see  in  that  tragic  art  which  to  Plato  seemed  noble  and

meritorious? Something quite abstruse and irrational, full of causes without

effects and effects seemingly without causes, the whole texture so checkered

that  it  must  be  repugnant  to  a  sober  disposition,  while  it  might  act  as

dangerous tinder to a sensitive and impressionable mind. We are told that the

only genre of poetry Socrates really appreciated was the Aesopian fable. This

he did with the same smiling complaisance with which honest Gellert sings

the praise of poetry in his fable of the bee and the hen:

  Poems are useful: they can tell

  The truth by means of parable

  To those who are not very bright.

  The fact is that for Socrates tragic art failed even to "convey the truth,"

although it did address itself to those who were "a bit backward," which is to

say to non-philosophers: a double reason for leaving it alone. Like Plato, he

reckoned it among the beguiling arts which represent the agreeable, not the

useful,  and  in  consequence  exhorted  his  followers  to  abstain  from  such

unphilosophical stimulants. His success was such that the young tragic poet

Plato burned all his writings in order to qualify as a student of Socrates. And

while strong native genius might now and again manage to withstand the

Socratic injunction, the power of the latter was still great enough to forcepoetry into entirely new channels.

  A good example of this is Plato himself. Although he did not lag behind

the naive cynicism of his master in the condemnation of tragedy and of art in

general, nevertheless his creative gifts forced him to develop an art form

deeply  akin  to  the  existing  forms  which  he  had  repudiated.  The  main

objection  raised  by  Plato  to  the  older  art  (that  it  was  the  imitation  of  an

imitation and hence belonged to an even lower order of empiric reality) must

not, at all costs, apply to the new genre; and so we see Plato intent on moving

beyond reality and on rendering the idea which underlies it. By a detour Plato

the thinker reached the very spot where Plato the poet had all along been at

home, and from which Sophocles, and with him the whole poetic tradition of

the past, protested such a charge. Tragedy had assimilated to itself all the

older poetic genres. In a somewhat eccentric sense the same thing can be

claimed for the Platonic dialogue, which was a mixture of all the available

styles and forms and hovered between narrative, Iyric, drama, between prose

and poetry, once again breaking through the old law of stylistic unity. The

Cynic  philosophers  went  even  farther  in  that  direction,  seeking,  by  their

utterly promiscuous style and constant alternation between verse and prose,

to project their image of the "raving Socrates" in literature, as they sought to

enact  it  in  life.  The  Platonic  dialogue  was  the  lifeboat  in  which  the

shipwrecked older poetry saved itself, together with its numerous offspring.

Crowded together in a narrow space, and timidly obeying their helmsman

Socrates, they moved forward into a new era which never tired of looking at

this fantastic spectacle. Plato has furnished for all posterity the pattern of a

new art form, the novel, viewed as the Aesopian fable raised to its highest

power; a form in which poetry played the same subordinate role with regard

to  dialectic  philosophy  as  that  same  philosophy  was  to  play  for  many

centuries with regard to theology. This, then, was the new status of poetry,

and it was Plato who, under the pressure of daemonic Socrates, had brought it

about.

  It is at this point that philosophical ideas begin to entwine themselves

about art, forcing the latter to cling closely to the trunk of dialectic. The

Apollinian tendency now appears disguised as logical schematism, just as we

found in the case of Euripides a corresponding translation of the Dionysian

affect into a naturalistic one. Socrates, the dialectical hero of the Platonic

drama, shows a close affinity to the Euripidean hero, who is compelled to

justify his actions by proof and counterproof, and for that reason is often indanger of forfeiting our tragic compassion. For who among us can close his

eyes  to  the  optimistic  element  in  the  nature  of  dialectics,  which  sees  a

triumph in every syllogism and can breathe only in an atmosphere of cool,

conscious  clarity?  Once  that  optimistic  element  had  entered  tragedy,  it

overgrew  its  Dionysian  regions  and  brought  about  their  annihilation  and,

finally, the leap into genteel domestic drama Consider the consequences of

the Socratic maxims: virtue is knowledge; all sins arise from ignorance; only

the virtuous are happy"--these three basic formulations of optimism spell the

death of tragedy. The virtuous hero must henceforth be a dialectician; virtue

and  knowledge,  belief  and  ethics,  be  necessarily  and  demonstrably

connected; Aeschylus' transcendental concept of justice be reduced to the

brash and shallow principle of poetic justice with its regular deus ex machina.

  What is the view taken of the chorus in this new Socratic optimistic stage

world, and of the entire musical and Dionysian foundation of tragedy? They

are seen as accidental features, as reminders of the origin of tragedy, which

can well be dispensed with--while we have in fact come to understand that

the chorus is the cause of tragedy and the tragic spirit. Already in Sophocles

we find some embarrassment with regard to the chorus, which suggests that

the Dionysian floor of tragedy is beginning to give way. Sophocles no longer

dares to give the chorus the major role in the tragedy but treats it as almost on

the same footing as the actors, as though it had been raised from the orchestra

onto the scene. By so doing he necessarily destroyed its meaning, despite

Aristotle's endorsement of this conception of the chorus. This shift in attitude,

which  Sophocles  displayed  not  only  in  practice  but  also,  we  are  told,  in

theory,  was  the  first  step  toward  the  total  disintegration  of  the  chorus:  a

process whose rapid phases we can follow in Euripides, Agathon, and the

New Comedy. Optimistic dialectics took up the whip of its syllogisms and

drove music out of tragedy. It entirely destroyed the meaning of tragedy--

which  can  be  interpreted  only  as  a  concrete  manifestation  of  Dionysian

conditions, music made visible, an ecstatic dream world.

  Since  we  have  discovered  an  anti-Dionysian  tendency  antedating

Socrates, its most brilliant exponent, we must now ask, "Toward what does a

figure  like  Socrates  point?"  Faced  with  the  evidence  of  the  Platonic

dialogues, we are certainly not entitled to see in Socrates merely an agent of

disintegration.  While  it  is  clear  that  the  immediate  result  of  the  Socratic

strategy was the destruction of Dionysian drama, we are forced, nevertheless,

by the profundity of the Socratic experience to ask ourselves whether, in fact,art and Socratism are diametrically opposed to one another, whether there is

really anything inherently impossible in the idea of a Socratic artist?

  It appears that this despotic logician had from time to time a sense of

void, loss, unfulfilled duty with regard to art. In prison he told his friends

how, on several occasions, a voice had spoken to him in a dream, saying

"Practice music, Socrates!" Almost to the end he remained confident that his

philosophy  represented  the  highest  art  of  the  muses,  and  would  not  fully

believe that a divinity meant to remind him of "common, popular music." Yet

in order to unburden his conscience he finally agreed, in prison, to undertake

that music which hitherto he had held in low esteem. In this frame of mind he

composed a poem on Apollo and rendered several Aesopian fables in verse.

What prompted him to these exercises was something very similar to that

warning  voice  of  his  daimonion:  an  Apollinian  perception  that,  like  a

barbarian king, he had failed to comprehend the nature of a divine effigy, and

was in danger of offending his own god through ignorance. These words

heard  by  Socrates  in  his  dream  are  the  only  indication  that  he  ever

experienced any uneasiness about the limits of his logical universe. He may

have asked himself: "Have I been too ready to view what was unintelligible

to me as being devoid of meaning? Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom, after

all, from which the logician is excluded? Perhaps art must be seen as the

necessary complement of rational discourse?"

  15

  In the spirit of these last suggestive questions it must now be said how the

influence of Socrates, down to the present moment and even into all future

time,  has  spread  over  posterity  like  a  shadow  that  keeps  growing  in  the

evening sun, and how it again and again prompts a regeneration of art--of art

in  the  metaphysical,  broadest  and  profoundest  sense--and  how  its  own

infinity also guarantees the infinity of art.

  Before  this  could  be  recognized,  before  the  innermost  dependence  of

every  art  on  the  Greeks,  from  Homer  to  Socrates,  was  demonstrated

conclusively, we had to feel about these Greeks as the Athenians felt about

Socrates. Nearly every age and stage of culture has at some time or other

sought with profound irritation to free itself from the Greeks, because in their

presence  everything  one  has  achieved  oneself,  though  apparently  quite

original and sincerely admired, suddenly seemed to lose life and color and

shriveled into a poor copy, even a caricature. And so time after time cordial

anger erupts against this presumptuous little people that made bold for alltime to designate everything not native as "barbaric." Who are they, one asks,

who, though they display only an ephemeral historical splendor, ridiculously

restricted institutions, dubious excellence in their mores, and are marked by

ugly vices, yet lay claim to that dignity and pre-eminence among peoples

which  characterize  genius  among  the  masses?  Unfortunately,  no  one  was

lucky  enough  to  find  the  cup  of  hemlock  with  which  one  could  simply

dispose of such a character; for all the poison that envy, calumny, and rancor

created did not suffice to destroy that self-sufficient splendor. And so one

feels ashamed and afraid in the presence of the Greeks, unless one prizes

truth above all things and dares acknowledge even this truth: that the Greeks,

as  charioteers,  hold  in  their  hands  the  reins  of  our  own  and  every  other

culture, but that almost always chariot and horses are of inferior quality and

not up to the glory of their leaders, who consider it sport to run such a team

into an abyss which they themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.

  In order to vindicate the dignity of such a leader's position for Socrates,

too, it is enough to recognize in him a type of existence unheard of before

him: the type of he theoretical man whose significance and aim it is our next

task to try to understand. Like the artist, the theoretical man finds an infinite

delight  in  whatever  exists,  and  this  satisfaction  protects  him  against  the

practical ethics of pessimism with its Lyncaeus eyes that shine only in the

dark. Whenever the truth is uncovered, the artist will always cling with rapt

gaze  to  what  still  remains  covering  even  after  such  uncovering;  but  the

theoretical man enjoys and finds satisfaction in the discarded covering and

finds  the  highest  object  of  his  pleasure  in  the  process  of  an  ever  happy

uncovering that succeeds through his own efforts.

  There would be no science if it were concerned only with that one nude

goddess and with nothing else. For in that case her devotees would have to

feel like men who wanted to dig a hole straight through the earth, assuming

that each of them realized that even if he tried his utmost, his whole life long,

he would only be able to dig a very small portion of this enormous depth, and

even that would be filled in again before his own eyes by the labors of the

next in line, so a third person would seem to do well if he picked a new spot

for his drilling efforts. Now suppose someone proved convincingly that the

goal of the antipodes cannot be reached in this direct manner: who would still

wish to go on working in these old depths, unless he had learned meanwhile

to be satisfied with finding precious stones or discovering laws of nature?

  Therefore Lessing, the most honest theoretical man, dared to announcethat he cared more for the search after truth than for truth itself--and thus

revealed the fundamental secret of science, to the astonishment, and indeed

the anger, of the scientific community. ["If God had locked up all truth in his

right hand, and in his left the unique, ever-live striving for truth, albeit with

the  addition  that  I  should  always  and  eternally  err,  and  he  said  to  me,

'Choose!'--I should humbly clasp his left hand, saying: 'Father, give! Pure

truth is after all for thee alone!'"--Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-81), Eine

Duplik, 1778.] Beside this isolated insight, born of an excess of honesty if not

of exuberance, there is, to be sure, a profound illusion that first saw the light

of the world in the person of Socrates: the unshakable faith that thought,

using the thread of logic, can penetrate the deepest abysses of being, and that

thought is capable not only of knowing being but even of correcting it. This

sublime metaphysical illusion accompanies science as an instinct and leads

science again and again to its limits at which it must turn into art--which is

really the aim of this mechanism.

  With the torch of this thought in our hands, let us now look at Socrates:

he appears to us as the first who could not only live, guided by the instinct of

science, but also--and this is far more--die that way. Hence the image of the

dying  Socrates,  as  the  human  being  whom  knowledge  and  reasons  have

liberated from the fear of death, is the emblem that, above the entrance gate

of  science,  reminds  all  of  its  mission--namely,  to  make  existence  appear

comprehensible and thus justified; and if reasons do not suffice, myth had to

come to their aid in the end--myth which I have just called the necessary

consequence, indeed the purpose, of science.

  Once we see clearly how after Socrates, the mystagogue of science, one

philosophical school succeeds another, wave upon wave; how the hunger for

knowledge reached a never-suspected universality in the widest domain of

the educated world, became the real task for every person of higher gifts, and

led science onto the high seas from which it has never again been driven

altogether; how this universality first spread a common net of thought over

the whole globe, actually holding out the prospect of the lawfulness of an

entire solar system; once we see all this clearly, along with the amazingly

high  pyramid  of  knowledge  in  our  own  time--we  cannot  fail  to  see  in

Socrates the one turning point and vortex of so-called world history. For if

we imagine that the whole incalculable sum of energy used up for this world

tendency had been used not in the service of knowledge but for the practical,

i.e., egoistic aims of individuals and peoples, then we realize that in that caseuniversal  wars  of  annihilation  and  continual  migrations  of  peoples  would

probably have weakened the instinctive lust for life to such an extent that

suicide would have become a general custom and individuals might have

experienced the final remnant of a sense of duty when, like the inhabitants of

the  Fiji  islands,  they  had  strangled  their  parents  and  friends--a  practical

pessimism  that  might  even  have  generated  a  gruesome  ethic  of  genocide

[V�lkermord.]  motivated  by  pity,  and  which  incidentally  is,  and  was,

present in the world wherever art did not appear in some form--especially as

religion  and  science--as  a  remedy  and  a  preventive  for  this  breath  of

pestilence.

  By contrast with this practical pessimism, Socrates is the prototype of the

theoretical  optimist  who,  with  his  faith  that  the  nature  of  things  can  be

fathomed, ascribes to knowledge and insight the power of a panacea, while

understanding error as the evil par excellence. To fathom the depths and to

separate true knowledge from appearance and error, seemed to Socratic man

the noblest, even the only truly human vocation. And since Socrates, this

mechanism of concepts, judgments, and inferences has been esteemed as the

highest occupation and the most admirable gift of nature, above all other

capacities. Even the most sublime ethical deeds, the stirrings of pity, self-

sacrifice, heroism, and that calm sea of the soul, so difficult to attain, which

the  Apollinian  Greek  called  sophrosune,  were  derived  from  the  dialectic

knowledge by Socrates and his like-minded successors, down to the present,

and accordingly designated as teachable.

  Anyone who has ever experienced the pleasure of Socratic insight and felt

how, spreading in ever-widening circles, it seeks to embrace the whole world

of appearances, will never again find any stimulus toward existence more

violent  than  the  craving  to  complete  this  conquest  and  to  weave  the  net

impenetrably tight. To one who feels that way, the Platonic Socrates will

appear as the teacher of an altogether new form of "Greek cheerfulness" and

blissful affirmation of existence that seeks to discharge itself in actions--most

often in maieutic and educational influences on noble youths, with a view to

eventually producing a genius.

  But science, spurred by its powerful illusion, speeds irresistibly towards

its  limits  where  its  optimism,  concealed  in  the  essence  of  logic,  suffers

shipwreck. For the periphery of the circle of science has an infinite number of

points; and while there is no telling how this circle could ever be surveyed

completely, noble and gifted men nevertheless reach, e'er half their time andinevitably, such boundary points on the periphery from which one gazes into

what defies illumination. When they see to their horror how logic coils up at

these boundaries and finally bites its own tail--suddenly the new form of

insight breaks through, tragic insight which, merely to be endured, needs art

as a protection and remedy.

  Our eyes strengthened and refreshed by our contemplation of the Greeks,

let us look at the highest spheres of the world around us; then we shall see

how  the  hunger  for  insatiable  and  optimistic  knowledge  that  in  Socrates

appears exemplary has turned into tragic resignation and destitute need for

art--while, to be sure, the same hunger on its lower levels can express itself in

hostility  to  art  and  must  particularly  detest  Dionysian-tragic  art,  as  was

illustrated earlier with the fight of Socratism against Aeschylean tragedy.

  Here we knock, deeply moved, at the gates of present and future: will this

"turning"  lead  to  ever-new  configurations  of  genius  and  especially  of  the

Socrates who practices music? Will the net of art, even if it is called religion

or science, that is spread over existence be woven even more tightly and

delicately, or is it destined to be torn to shreds in the restless, barbarous,

chaotic whirl that now calls itself "the present"?

  Concerned  but  not  disconsolate,  we  stand  aside  a  little  while,

contemplative men to whom it has been granted to be witnesses of these

tremendous struggles and transitions. Alas, it is the magic of these struggles

that those who behold them must also take part and fight.

  16

  By this elaborate historical example we have sought to make clear how

just as tragedy perishes with the evanescence of the spirit of music, it is only

from this spirit that it can be reborn. Lest this assertion seem too strange, it

may be well to disclose the origin of this insight by considering the analogous

phenomena of our own time; we must enter into the midst of those struggles,

which, as I have just said, are being waged in the highest spheres of our

contemporary world between insatiable optimistic knowledge and the tragic

need of art. In my examination I shall leave out of account all those other

antagonistic tendencies which at all times oppose art, especially tragedy, and

which now are again extending their triumphant sway to such an extent that

of the theatrical arts only the farce and the ballet, for example, put forth their

blossoms,  which  perhaps  not  everyone  cares  to  smell,  in  rather  rich

luxuriance. I will speak only of the noblest opposition to the tragic world-

conception--and by this I mean science, which is at bottom optimistic, withits ancestor Socrates at its head. A little later on I shall also name those forces

which  seem  to  me  to  guarantee  a  rebirth  of  tragedy--and  perhaps  other

blessed hopes for the German genius!

  Before we plunge into the midst of these struggles, let us array ourselves

in the armor of the insights we have acquired. In contrast to all those who are

intent on deriving the arts from one exclusive principle, as the necessary vital

source of every work of art, I shall keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic

deities of the Greeks, Apollo and Dionysus, and recognize in them the living

and  conspicuous  representatives  of  two  worlds  of  art  differing  in  their

intrinsic essence and in their highest aims. I see Apollo as the transfiguring

genius of the principium individuationis through which alone the redemption

in illusion is truly to be obtained; while by the mystical triumphant cry of

Dionysus the spell of individuation is broken, and the way lies open to the

Mothers  of  Being,  to  the  innermost  heart  of  things.  This  extraordinary

contrast,  which  stretches  like  a  yawning  gulf  between  plastic  art  as  the

Apollinian, and music as the Dionysian art, has revealed itself to only one of

the  great  thinkers,  to  such  an  extent  that,  even  without  this  clue  to  the

symbolism of the Hellenic divinities, he concedes to music a character and an

origin different from all the other arts, because, unlike them, it is not a copy

of the phenomenon, but an immediate copy of the will itself, and therefore

complements  everything  physical  in  the  world  and  every  phenomenon  by

representing what is metaphysical, the thing in itself. (Schopenhauer, Welt als

Wille und Vorstellung, I, p. 310.)

  To  this  most  important  insight  of  aesthetics  (with  which,  in  the  most

serious  sense,  aesthetics  properly  begins),  Richard  Wagner,  by  way  of

confirmation of its eternal truth, affixed his seal, when he asserted in his

Beethoven  that  music  must  be  evaluated  according  to  aesthetic  principles

quite different form those which apply to all plastic arts, and not, in general,

according  to  the  category  of  beauty;  although  an  erroneous  aesthetics,

inspired by a mistaken and degenerate art, has, by virtue of the concept of

beauty obtaining in the plastic domain, accustomed itself to demand of music

an  effect  similar  to  that  produced  by  works  of  plastic  art,  namely,  the

arousing of delight in beautiful forms. Having recognized this extraordinary

contrast, I felt a strong need to approach the essence of Greek tragedy and,

with it, the profoundest revelation of the Hellenic genius; for I at last thought

that I possessed a charm to enable me--far beyond the phraseology of our

usual aesthetics--to represent vividly to my mind the fundamental problem oftragedy; whereby I was granted such a surprising and unusual insight into the

Hellenic character that it necessarily seemed to me as if our classical-Hellenic

science that bears itself so proudly had thus far contrived to subsist mainly on

shadow plays and externals.

  Perhaps  we  may  touch  on  this  fundamental  problem  by  asking:  what

aesthetic effect results when the essentially separate art-forces, the Apollinian

and the Dionysian, enter into simultaneous activity? Or more briefly: how is

music related to image and concept? Schopenhauer, whom Richard Wagner,

with special reference to this point, praises for an unsurpassable clearness and

clarity of exposition, expresses himself most thoroughly on the subject in the

following passage which I shall cite here at full length (Welt als Wille und

Vorstellung, I, p. 309): "according to all this, we may regard the phenomenal

world, or nature, and music as two different expressions of the same thing,

which  is  therefore  itself  the  only  medium  of  their  analogy,  so  that  a

knowledge of it is demanded in order to understand that analogy. Music,

therefore, if regarded as an expression of the world, is in the highest degree a

universal language, which is related indeed to the universality of concepts,

much as they are related to the particular things. Its, universality, however, is

by no means that empty universality of abstraction, but of quite a different

kind, and is united with thorough and distinct definiteness. In this respect it

resembles geometrical figures and numbers, which are the universal forms of

all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all a priori, and yet

are  not  abstract  but  perceptible  and  thoroughly  determinate.  All  possible

efforts, excitements, and manifestations of will, all that goes on in the heart of

man and that reason includes in the wide, negative concept of feeling, may be

expressed  by  the  infinite  number  of  possible  melodies,  but  always  in  the

universal, in the mere form, without the material, always according to the

thing-in-itself,  not  the  phenomenon,  the  inmost  soul,  as  it  were,  of  the

phenomenon without the body. This deep relation which music has to the true

nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable music played to any

scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to disclose to us its utmost secret

meaning, and appears as the most accurate and distinct commentary upon it.

This  is  so  truly  the  case  that  whoever  gives  himself  up  entirely  to  the

impression of a symphony, seems to see all the possible events of life and the

world take place in himself; yet if he reflects, he can find no likeness between

the music and the things that passed before his mind. For, as we have said,

music is distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a copyof the phenomenon, or, more accurately, of the adequate objectivity of the

will, but an immediate copy of the will itself, and therefore complements

everything physical in the world and every phenomenon by representing what

is metaphysical, the thing in itself. We might, therefore, just as well call the

world embodied music as embodied will; and this is the reason why music

makes every painting, and indeed every scene of real life and of the world, at

once appear with higher significance, certainly all the more, in proportion as

its  melody  is  analogous  to  the  inner  spirit  of  the  given  phenomenon.

Therefore  we  are  able  to  set  a  poem  to  music  as  a  song,  or  a  visible

representation as a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures

of human life, set to the universal language of music, are never bound to it or

correspond to it with a stringent necessity; but they stand to it only in the

relation  of  an  example  chosen  at  will  to  a  general  concept.  In  the

determinateness of the real, they represent that which music expresses in the

universality of mere form. For melodies are to a certain extent, like general

concepts, an abstraction from the actual. This actual world, then, the world of

particular things, affords the object of perception, the special and individual,

the  particular  case,  both  to  the  universality  of  the  concepts  and  to  the

universality  of  the  melodies.  But  these  two  universalities  are  in  a  certain

respect opposed to each other; for the concepts contain particulars only as the

first  forms  abstracted  from  perception,  as  it  were,  the  separated  shell  of

things; thus they are, strictly speaking, abstracta: music, on the other hand,

gives the inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things. This

relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen, by

saying,  the  concepts  are  the  universalia  post  rem,  but  music  gives  the

univesralia ante rem, and the real world the universalia in re. But that in

general  a  relation  is  possible  between  a  composition  and  a  visible

representation  rests,  as  we  have  said,  upon  the  fact  that  both  are  simply

different expressions of the same inner being of the world. When now, in the

particular case, such a relation is actually given, that is to say, when the

composer has been able to express in the universal language of music the

stirrings of will which constitute the heart of an event, then the melody of the

song, the music of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy discovered by the

composer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge

of  the  nature  of  the  world  unknown  to  his  reason,  and  must  not  be  an

imitation produced with conscious intention by means of concepts, otherwise

the music does not express the inner nature, the will itself, but merely givesan inadequate imitation of its phenomenon. All truly imitative music does

this."

    According  to  the  doctrine  of  Schopenhauer,  therefore,  we  understand

music as the immediate language of the will, and we feel our fancy stimulated

to give form to this invisible and yet so actively stirred spirit-world which

speaks to us, and we feel prompted to embody it in an analogous example.

On  the  other  hand,  image  and  concept,  under  the  influence  of  a  truly

corresponding music, acquires a higher significance. Dionysian art therefore

is wont to exercise two kinds of influences on the Apollinian art faculty:

music incites to the symbolic intuition of Dionysian universality, and music

allows the symbolic image to emerge in its highest significance. From these

facts, intelligible in themselves and not inaccessible to a more penetrating

examination, I infer the capacity of music to give birth to myth (the most

significant  example),  and  particularly  the  tragic  myth:  the  myth  which

expresses Dionysian knowledge in symbols. In the phenomenon of the lyrist,

I have shown how music strives to express its nature in Apollinian images. If

now we reflect that music at its highest stage must seek to attain also to its

highest objectification in images, we must deem it possible that it also knows

how to find the symbolic expression for its unique Dionysian wisdom; and

where shall we seek for this expression if not in tragedy and, in general, in

the conception of the tragic?

  From the nature of art as it is usually conceived according to the single

category of appearance and beauty, the tragic cannot honestly be deduced at

all;  it  is  only  through  the  spirit  of  music  that  we  can  understand  the  joy

involved  in  the  annihilation  of  the  individual.  For  it  is  only  in  particular

examples of such annihilation that we are clearly the eternal phenomenon of

Dionysian art, which gives expression to the will in its omnipotence, as it

were,  behind  the  principium  individuationis,  the  eternal  life  beyond  all

phenomena, and despite all annihilation. The metaphysical joy in the tragic is

a  translation  of  the  instinctive  unconscious  Dionysian  wisdom  into  the

language of images: the hero, the highest manifestation of the will, is negated

for our pleasure, because he is only phenomenon, and because the eternal life

of the will is not affected by his annihilation. "We believe in eternal life,"

exclaims tragedy; while music is the immediate idea of this life. Plastic art

has an altogether different aim: here Apollo overcomes the suffering of the

individual by the radiant glorification of the eternity of the phenomenon: here

beauty triumphs over the suffering inherent in life; pain is obliterated by liesfrom the features of nature. In Dionysian art and its tragic symbolism the

same nature cries to us with its true, undissembled voice: "Be as I am! Amid

the  ceaseless  flux  of  phenomena  I  am  the  eternally  creative  primordial

mother, eternally impelling to existence, eternally finding satisfaction in this

change of phenomena!"

  17

  Dionysian art, too, wishes to convince us of the eternal joy of existence:

only we are to seek this joy not in phenomena, but behind them. We are to

recognize that all that comes into being must be ready for a sorrowful end;

we are forced to look into the terrors of the individual existence--yet we are

not to become rigid with fear: a metaphysical comfort tears us momentarily

from the bustle of the changing figures. We are really for a brief moment

primordial  being  itself,  feeling  its  raging  desire  for  existence  and  joy  in

existence; the struggle, the pain, the destruction of phenomena, now appear

necessary to us, in view of the excess of countless forms of existence which

force and push one another into life, in view of the exuberant fertility of the

universal will. We are pierced by the maddening stings of these pains just

when we have become, as it were, one with the infinite primordial joy in

existence, and when we anticipate, in Dionysian ecstasy, the indestructibility

and eternity of this joy. In spite of fear and pity, we are the happy living

beings, not as individuals, but as the one living being, with whose creative

joy we are united.

  The  history  of  the  rise  of  Greek  tragedy  now  tells  us  with  luminous

precision how the tragic art of the Greeks was really born of the spirit of

music. With this conception we believe we have done justice for the first time

to the primitive and astonishing significance of the chorus. At the same time,

however, we must admit that the meaning of tragic myth set forth above

never became clear in transparent concepts to the Greek poets, not to speak of

the Greek philosophers: their heroes speak, as it were, more superficially than

they act; the myth does not at all obtain adequate objectification in the spoken

word.  The  structure  of  the  scenes  and  the  visual  images  reveal  a  deeper

wisdom than the poet himself can put into words and concepts: the same is

also observable in Shakespeare, whose Hamlet, for instance, similarly, talks

more superficially than he acts, so that the previously mentioned lesson of

Hamlet  is  to  be  deduced,  not  from  his  words,  but  from  a  profound

contemplation and survey of the whole.

  With respect to Greek tragedy, which of course presents itself to us onlyas word-drama, I have even intimated that the lack of congruity between

myth and expression might easily lead us to regard it as shallower and less

significant  than  it  really  is,  and  accordingly  to  attribute  to  it  a  more

superficial effect than it must have had according to the testimony of the

ancients: for how easily one forgets that what the word-poet did not succeed

in doing, namely, attain the highest spiritualization and ideality of the myth,

he might very well succeed in doing every moment as creative musician! To

be sure, we are almost forced to construct for ourselves by scholarly research

the superior power of the musical effect in order to experience something of

the  incomparable  comfort  which  must  have  been  characteristic  of  true

tragedy. Even this musical superiority, however, would only have been felt

by us had we been Greeks; for in the entire development of Greek music--as

compared  with  the  infinitely  richer  music  known  and  familiar  to  us--we

imagine  we  hear  only  the  youthful  song  of  the  musical  genius  modestly

intoned. The Greeks, as the Egyptian priests say, are eternal children, and in

tragic  art  too  they  are  only  children  who  do  not  know  what  a  sublime

plaything originated in their hands and--was quickly demolished.

  The  striving  of  the  spirit  of  music  toward  visual  and  mythical

objectification, which increases from the beginnings of lyric poetry up to

Attic tragedy, suddenly breaks off after attaining a luxuriant development,

and  disappears,  as  it  were,  from  the  surface  of  Hellenic  art;  while  the

Dionysian world view born of this striving lives on in the mysteries and, in its

strangest metamorphoses and debasements, does not cease to attract serious

natures. Will it not some day rise once again out of its mystic depths as art?

  Here we are detained by the question, whether the power, by virtue of

whose opening influence tragedy perished, has for all time sufficient strength

to prevent the artistic reawakening of tragedy and the tragic world view. If

ancient  tragedy  was  diverted  from  its  course  by  the  dialectical  desire  for

knowledge and the optimism of science, this fact might lead us to believe that

there is an eternal conflict between the theoretic and the tragic world view;

and only after the spirit of science has been pursued to its limits, and its claim

to universal validity destroyed by the evidence of these limits may we hope

for a rebirth of tragedy--a form of culture for which we should have to use the

symbol of the music-practicing Socrates in the sense spoken of above [See

Section 15]. In this contrast, I understand by the spirit of science the faith that

first came to light in the person of Socrates--the faith in the explicability of

nature and in knowledge as a panacea.  He who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly progressing

spirit of science will realize at once that myth was annihilated by it, and that,

because of this annihilation, poetry was driven like a homeless being from

her natural ideal soil. If we have been right in assigning to music the power

of again giving birth to myth, we may similarly expect to find the spirit of

science on the path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic power of

music. This takes place in the development of the New Attic Dithyramb, the

music of which no longer expressed the inner essence, the will itself, but only

rendered  the  phenomenon  inadequately,  in  an  imitation  by  means  of

concepts.  From  this  intrinsically  degenerate  music  the  genuinely  musical

natures  turned  away  with  the  same  repugnance  that  they  felt  for  the  art-

destroying tendency of Socrates. The unerring instinct of Aristophanes was

surely right when it included Socrates himself, the tragedy of Euripides, and

the  music  of  the  New  Dithyrambic  poets  in  the  same  feeling  of  hatred,

recognizing in all three phenomena the signs of a degenerate culture.

  In this New Dithyramb, music is outrageously manipulated so as to be the

imitative counterfeit of a phenomenon, for instance, of a battle or a storm at

sea; and thus, of course, it has been utterly robbed of its mythopoeic power.

For  if  it  seeks  to  arouse  pleasure  only  by  impelling  us  to  seek  external

analogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical figures

and characteristic sounds of music; if our understanding is to content itself

with the perception of these analogies; we are reduced to a frame of mind

which makes impossible any reception of the mythical; for the myth wants to

be experienced vividly as a unique example of a universality and truth that

gaze into the infinite. The truly Dionysian music presents itself as such a

general mirror of the universal will: the vivid event refracted in this mirror

expands  at  once  for  our  consciousness  to  the  copy  of  an  external  truth.

Conversely, such a vivid event is at once divested of every mythical character

by the tone-painting of the New Dithyramb; music now becomes a wretched

cop of the phenomenon, and therefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon

itself. And through this poverty it still further reduces the phenomenon for

our consciousness, so that now, for example, a musically imitated battle of

this sort exhausts itself in marches, signal sounds, etc., and our imagination is

arrested  precisely  by  these  superficialities.  Tone-painting  is  thus  in  every

respect the opposite of true music with its mythopoeic power: through it the

phenomenon, poor in itself, is made still poorer, while through Dionysian

music the individual phenomenon is enriched and expanded into an image ofthe world. It was a great triumph for the un-Dionysian spirit when, by the

development of the New Dithyramb, it had estranged music from itself and

reduced it to be the slave of phenomena. Euripides, who, though in a higher

sense, must be considered a thoroughly unmusical nature, is for this very

reason a passionate adherent of the New Dithyrambic Music, and with the

liberality of a robber makes use of all its effective tricks and mannerisms.

  In another direction also we see at work the power of this un-Dionysian

myth-opposing  spirit,  when  we  turn  our  attention  to  the  prevalence  of

character  representation  and  psychological  refinement  in  tragedy  from

Sophocles onward. The character must no longer be expanded into an eternal

type,  but,  on  the  contrary,  must  develop  individually  through  artistic

subordinate traits and shadings, through the nicest precision of all lines, in

such a manner that the spectator is in general no longer conscious of the

myth, but of the vigorous truth to nature and the artist's imitative power. Here

also we observe the victory of the phenomenon over the universal, and the

delight  in  a  unique,  almost  anatomical  preparation;  we  are  already  in  the

atmosphere of a theoretical world, where scientific knowledge is valued more

highly than the artistic reflection of a universal law.

  The movement in the direction of character delineation proceeds rapidly:

while  Sophocles  still  portrays  complete  characters  and  employs  myth  for

their refined development, Euripides already draws only prominent individual

traits of character, which can express themselves in violent bursts of passion.

In  the  New  Attic  Comedy,  however,  there  are  only  masks  with  one

expression: frivolous old men, duped panders, and cunning slaves, recurring

incessantly. Where now is the mythopoeic spirit of music? What still remains

of music is either excitatory or reminiscent music, that is, either a stimulant

for dull and faded nerves, or tone-painting. As regards the former, it hardly

matters about the text set to it: as soon as his heroes and choruses begin to

sing, everything becomes pretty slovenly in Euripides; to what pass must

things have come with his impertinent successors?

  The new un-Dionysian spirit, however, reveals itself more plainly in the

denouements of the new dramas. In the Old Tragedy one could sense at the

end that metaphysical comfort without which the delight in tragedy cannot be

explained  at  all.  The  reconciling  tones  from  another  world  sound  purest,

perhaps, in the Oedipus at Colonus. Now that the genius of music has fled

from tragedy, tragedy, strictly speaking, is dead: for from what source shall

we now draw this metaphysical comfort? The new spirit, therefore, sought foran  earthly  resolution  of  the  tragic  dissonance.  The  hero,  after  being

sufficiently  tortured  by  fate,  earned  a  well-deserved  reward  through  a

splendid marriage or tokens of divine favor. The hero had turned gladiator on

whom, after he had been nicely beaten and covered with wounds, freedom

was  occasionally  bestowed.  The  deus  ex  machina  took  the  place  of

metaphysical comfort.

  I  will  not  say  that  the  tragic  world  view  was  everywhere  completely

destroyed by this intruding un-Dionysian spirit: we only know that it had to

flee from art into the underworld as it were, in the degenerate form of a secret

cult. Over the widest extent of the Hellenic character, however, there raged

the  consuming  blast  of  this  spirit,  which  manifests  itself  in  the  form  of

"Greek  cheerfulness,"  which  we  have  already  spoken  of  as  a  senile,

unproductive  love  of  existence.  This  cheerfulness  stands  opposed  to  the

splendid  "na�vete"  of  the  earlier  Greeks,  which,  according  to  the

characterization  given  above,  must  be  conceived  as  the  blossom  of  the

Apollinian  culture  springing  from  a  dark  abyss,  as  the  victory  which  the

Hellenic will, through its mirroring of beauty, obtains over suffering and the

wisdom of suffering.

  The noblest manifestation of that other form of "Greek cheerfulness," the

Alexandrian, is the cheerfulness of the theoretical man. It exhibits the same

characteristic symptoms that I have just deduced from the spirit of the un-

Dionysian: it combats Dionysian wisdom and art, it seeks to dissolve myth, it

substitutes for a metaphysical comfort an earthly consonance, in fact, a deus

ex machina of its own, the god of machines and crucibles, that is, the powers

of the spirits of nature recognized and employed in the service of a higher

egoism; it believes that it can correct the world by knowledge, guiding life by

science,  and  actually  confine  the  individual  within  a  limited  sphere  of

solvable problems, from which he can cheerfully say to life: "I desire you;

you are worth knowing."

  18

  It is an eternal phenomenon: the insatiable will always find a way to

detain its creatures in life and compel them to live on, by means of an illusion

spread over things. One is chained by the Socratic love of knowledge and the

delusion of being able thereby to heal the eternal wound of existence; another

is ensnared by art's seductive veil of beauty fluttering before his eyes; still

another by the metaphysical comfort that beneath the whirl of phenomena

eternal life flows on indestructibly--to say nothing of the more vulgar andalmost more powerful illusions which the will always has at hand. These

three stages of illusion are actually designed only for the more nobly formed

natures, who actually feel profoundly the weight and burden of existence, and

must  be  deluded  by  exquisite  stimulants  into  forgetfulness  of  their

displeasure.  All  that  we  call  culture  is  made  up  of  these  stimulants;  and,

according to the proportion of the ingredients, we have either a dominantly

Socratic  or  artistic  or  tragic  culture;  or,  if  historical  exemplifications  are

permitted, there is either an Alexandrian or a Hellenic or a Buddhistic culture.

  Our whole modern world is entangled in the net of Alexandrian culture. It

proposes as its ideal the theoretical man equipped with the greatest forces of

knowledge,  and  laboring  in  the  service  of  science,  whose  archetype  and

progenitor is Socrates. All our educational methods originally have this ideal

in view: every other form of existence must struggle on laboriously beside it,

as something tolerated, but not intended. In an almost alarming manner the

culture man was for a long time found only in the form of the scholar: even

our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from scholarly imitations, and in

the main effect, that of rhyme, we still recognize the origin of our poetic form

from artificial experiments with a nonindigenous, really scholarly language.

How unintelligible must Faust, the modern cultured man, who is in himself

intelligible,  have  appeared  to  a  true  Greek--Faust,  storming  unsatisfied

through all the faculties, devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for

knowledge;  Faust,  whom  we  have  but  to  place  beside  Socrates  for  the

purpose  of  comparison,  in  order  to  see  that  modern  man  is  beginning  to

divine the limits of this Socratic love of knowledge and yearns for a coast in

the wide waste of the ocean of knowledge. When Goethe on one occasion

said to Eckermann with reference to Napoleon: "Yes, my good friend, there is

also  a  productiveness  of  deeds,"  he  reminded  us  in  a  charmingly  na�ve

manner  that  the  nontheorist  is  something  incredible  and  astounding  to

modern man; so that we again have need of the wisdom of Goethe to discover

that such a surprising form of existence is not only comprehensible, but even

pardonable.

  Now we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the womb of

this Socratic culture: optimism, with its delusion of limitless power. We must

not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen--if society, leavened to the

very lowest strata by this kind of culture, gradually begins to tremble with

wanton agitations and desires, if the belief in the earthly happiness of all, if

the belief in the possibility of such a general intellectual culture changes intothe threatening demand for such an Alexandrian earthly happiness, into the

conjuring up of a Euripidean deus ex machina.

  Let  us  mark  this  well:  the  Alexandrian  culture,  to  be  able  to  exist

permanently, requires a slave class, but with its optimistic view of life it

denies the necessity of such a class, and consequently, when its beautifully

seductive and tranquilizing utterances about the "dignity of man" and the

"dignity of labor" are no longer effective, it gradually drifts toward a dreadful

destruction. There is nothing more terrible than a class of barbaric slaves who

have learned to regard their existence as an injustice, and now prepare to

avenge,  not  only  themselves,  but  all  generations.  In  the  face  of  such

threatening storms, who dares to appeal with any confidence to our pale and

exhausted  religions,  the  very  foundations  of  which  have  degenerated  into

scholarly  religions?  Myth,  the  necessary  prerequisite  of  any  religion,  is

already paralyzed everywhere, and even in this domain the optimistic spirit,

which we have just designated as the germ of destruction in our society, has

attained the mastery.

  While  the  disaster  gradually  slumbering  in  the  womb  of  theoretical

culture gradually begins to frighten modern man, and he anxiously ransacks

the stores of his experience for means to avert the danger, though he has no

great  faith  in  these  means;  while  he,  therefore,  begins  to  divine  the

consequences of his situation--great men, universally gifted, have contrived,

with an incredible amount of thought, to make use of the paraphernalia of

science  itself,  to  point  out  the  limits  and  the  relativity  of  knowledge

generally,  and  thus  to  deny  decisively  the  claim  of  science  to  universal

validity and universal aims. And their demonstration diagnosed for the first

time the illusory notion which pretends to be able to fathom the innermost

essence of things with the aid of causality. The extraordinary courage and

wisdom  of  Kant  and  Schopenhauer  have  succeeded  in  gaining  the  most

difficult victory, the victory over the optimism concealed in the essence of

logic--an  optimism  that  is  the  basis  of  our  culture.  While  this  optimism,

resting on apparently unobjectionable aeternae veritates [Eternal verities.],

had  believed  that  all  the  riddles  of  the  universe  could  be  known  and

fathomed, and had treated space, time, and causality as entirely unconditional

laws of the most universal validity, Kant showed that these really served only

to elevate the mere phenomenon, the work of maya, to the position of the sole

and highest reality, as if it were the innermost and true essence of things, thus

making  impossible  any  knowledge  of  this  essence  or,  in  Schopenhauer'swords, lulling the dreamer still more soundly asleep.

  With this insight a culture is inaugurated that I venture to call a tragic

culture. Its most important characteristic is that wisdom takes the place of

science  as  the  highest  end--wisdom  that,  uninfluenced  by  the  seductive

distractions of the sciences, turns with unmoved eyes to a comprehensive

view of the world, and seeks to grasp, with sympathetic feelings of love, the

eternal suffering as its own.

  Let us imagine a coming generation with such intrepidity of vision, with

such a heroic penchant for the tremendous; let us imagine the bold stride of

these dragon-slayers, the proud audacity with which they turn their back on

all  the  weaklings'  doctrines  of  optimism  in  order  to  "live  resolutely"  in

wholeness and fullness: would it not be necessary for the tragic man of such a

culture, in view of his self-education for seriousness and terror, to desire a

new art, the art of metaphysical comfort, to desire tragedy as his own proper

Helen, and to exclaim with Faust:

  Should not my longing overleap the distance

  And draw the fairest form into existence?

  [From Goethe's Faust, lines 7438 ff.]

  But  now  that  the  Socratic  culture  can  only  hold  the  scepter  of  its

infallibility  with  trembling  hands;  now  that  it  has  been  shaken  from  two

directions--once by the fear of its own consequences which it at length begins

to surmise, and again because it no longer has its na�ve confidence in the

eternal validity of its foundation--it is a sad spectacle to see how the dance of

its thought rushes longingly toward ever-new forms, to embrace them, and

then, shuddering, lets them go suddenly as Mephistopheles does the seductive

Lamiae [Faust, lines 7766 ff.]. It is certainly the sign of the "breach" of which

everyone  speaks  as  the  fundamental  malady  of  modern  culture,  that  the

theoretical man, alarmed and dissatisfied at his own consequences, no longer

dares entrust himself to the terrible icy current of existence: he runs timidly

up and down the bank. So thoroughly has he been pampered by his optimistic

views that he no longer wants to have anything whole, with all of nature's

cruelty attaching to it.. Besides, he feels that a culture based on the principles

of science must be destroyed when it begins to grow illogical, that is, to

retreat before its own consequences. Our art reveals this universal distress: in

vain  does  one  depend  imitatively  on  all  the  great  productive  periods  and

natures;  in  vain  does  one  accumulate  the  entire  "world-literature"  around

modern man for his comfort; in vain does one place oneself in the midst ofthe art styles and artists of all ages, so that one may give names to them as

Adam  did  to  the  beasts:  one  still  remains  externally  hungry,  the  "critic"

without joy and energy, the Alexandrian man, who is at bottom a librarian

and corrector of proofs, and wretchedly goes blind from the dust of books

and from printers' errors.

  19

  We cannot indicate the innermost modern content of this Socratic culture

more distinctly than by calling it the culture of the opera: for it is in this

department  that  this  culture  has  expressed  its  aims  and  perceptions  with

special na�vete, which is surprising when we compare the genesis of the

opera and the facts of operatic development with the eternal truths of the

Apollinian  and  Dionysian.  I  recall  first  of  all  the  origin  of  the  stilo

rappresentativo [Representational style.] and the recitative. Is it credible that

this thoroughly externalized operatic music, incapable of devotion, could be

received and cherished with enthusiastic favor, as a rebirth, as it were, of all

true music, by the very age in which had appeared the ineffably sublime and

sacred  music  of  Palestrina?  And  who,  on  the  other  hand,  would  think  of

making only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those Florentine circles

and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the love of the opera

which spread with such rapidity? That in the same age, even among the same

people,  this  passion  for  a  half-musical  mode  of  speech  should  awaken

alongside of the vaulted structure of Palestrina harmonics which all medieval

Christendom  had  been  building  up,  I  can  explain  to  myself  only  by  a

cooperating, extra-artistic tendency in the essence of the recitative.

  The listener who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the music

has his desire fulfilled by the singer in that the latter speaks rather than sings,

intensifying the pathetic expression of the words by means of this half-song.

By this intensification of the pathos he facilitates the understanding of the

words and overcomes the remaining half of the music. The specific danger

now threatening him is that in some unguarded moment he may stress the

music unduly, which would immediately entail the destruction of the pathos

of the speech and the distinctness of the words; while, on the other hand, he

feels  himself  continually  impelled  to  musical  discharge  and  a  virtuoso

exhibition of his vocal talent. Here the "poet" comes to his aid, who knows

how  to  provide  him  with  abundant  opportunities  for  lyrical  interjections,

repetitions of words and sentences, etc.--at which places the singer, now in

the purely musical element, can rest himself without paying any attention tothe  words.  This  alternation  of  emotionally  impressive  speech  which,

however,  is  only  half  sung,  with  interjections  which  are  wholly  sung,  an

alternation characteristic of the stilo rappresentativo, this rapidly changing

endeavor to affect now the concepts and imagination of the hearer, now his

musical sense, is something so utterly unnatural and likewise so intrinsically

contradictory both to the Apollinian and Dionysian artistic impulses, that one

has  to  infer  an  origin  of  the  recitative  lying  outside  all  artistic  instincts.

According to this description, the recitative must be defined as a mixture of

epic and lyric delivery, not by any means as an intrinsically stable mixture, a

state not to be attained in the case of such totally disparate elements, but as an

entirely superficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally unprecedented in

the domain of nature and experience. But this was not the opinion of the

inventors of the recitative: they themselves, together with their age, believed

rather  that  the  mystery  of  antique  music  has  been  solved  by  this  stilo

rappresentativo,  in  which,  so  they  thought,  was  to  be  found  the  only

explanation of the enormous influence of an Orpheus, an Amphion, and even

of Greek tragedy. The new style was looked upon as the reawakening of the

most effective music, ancient Greek music: indeed, in accordance with the

universal and popular conception of the Homeric as the primitive world, they

could abandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into

the paradisiacal beginnings of mankind, where music also must have had that

unsurpassed purity, power, and innocence of which the poets, in their pastoral

plays, could give such touching accounts. Here we can see into the innermost

development of this thoroughly modern variety of art, the opera: art here

responds to a powerful need, but it is a nonaesthetic need: the yearning for

the idyllic, the faith in the primordial existence of the artistic and good man.

The recitative was regarded as the rediscovered language of this primitive

man; opera as the rediscovered country of this idyllically or heroically good

creature,  who  simultaneously  with  every  action  follows  a  natural  artistic

impulse, who accomplishes his speech with a little singing, in order that he

may  immediately  break  forth  into  full  song  at  the  slightest  emotional

excitement.

  It is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists of the time

combated the old ecclesiastical conception of man as inherently corrupt and

lost, with this newly created picture of the paradisiacal artist: so that opera is

to be understood as the opposition dogma of the good man, but may also, at

the same time, provide a consolation for that pessimism which, owing to thefrightful uncertainty of all conditions of life, attracted precisely the serious-

minded  men  of  the  time.  For  us,  it  is  enough  to  have  perceived  that  the

essential charm, and therefore the genesis, of this new art form lies in the

gratification of an altogether nonaesthetic need, in the optimistic glorification

of man as such, in the conception of the primitive man as the man naturally

good and artistic--a principle of the opera that has gradually changed into a

threatening  and  terrible  demand  which,  in  face  of  contemporary  socialist

movements, we can no longer ignore. The "good primitive man" wants his

rights: what paradisiacal prospects!

  Besides this I place another equally obvious confirmation of my view that

opera is based on the same principles as our Alexandrian culture. Opera is the

birth of the theoretical man, the critical layman, not of the artist: one of the

most  surprising  facts  in  the  history  of  all  the  arts.  It  was  the  demand  of

thoroughly unmusical hearers that before everything else the words must be

understood, so that according to them a rebirth of music is to be expected

only when some mode of singing has been discovered in which text-word

lords  it  over  counterpoint  like  master  over  servant.  For  the  words,  it  is

argued, are a much nobler than the accompanying harmonic system as the

soul is nobler than the body.

  It was in accordance with the laically unmusical crudeness of these views

that  the  combination  of  music,  image,  and  words  was  effected  in  the

beginnings of the opera. In the spirit of this aesthetic the first experiments

were made in the leading amateur circles of Florence by the poets and singers

patronized there. The man incapable of art creates for himself a kind of art

precisely because he is the inartistic man as such. Because he does not sense

the  Dionysian  depth  of  music,  he  changes  his  musical  taste  into  an

appreciation of the understandable word-and-tone-rhetoric of the passions in

the stilo rappresentativo, and into the voluptuousness of the arts of song.

Because he is unable to behold a vision, he forces the machinist and the

decorative  artist  into  his  service.  Because  he  cannot  comprehend  the  true

nature of the artist, he conjures up the "artistic primitive man" to suit his

taste, that is, the man who sings and recites verses under the influence of

passion.  He  dreams  himself  back  into  a  time  when  passion  sufficed  to

generate  songs  and  poems;  as  if  emotion  had  ever  been  able  to  create

anything artistic.

  The premise of the opera is a false belief concerning the artistic process:

the idyllic belief that every sentient man is an artist. This belief would makeopera the expression of the taste of the laity in art, dictating their laws with

the cheerful optimism of the theoretical man.

  Should we desire to combine the two conceptions that have just been

shown to have influenced the origin of opera, it would merely remain for us

to speak of an idyllic tendency of the opera. In this connection we need only

avail ourselves of the expressions and explanation of Schiller. Nature and the

ideal, he says, are either objects of grief, when the former is represented as

lost,  the  latter  unattained;  or  both  are  objects  of  joy,  in  that  they  are

represented  as  real.  The  first  case  furnishes  the  elegy  in  its  narrower

signification, the second the idyll in its widest sense.

  Here we must at once call attention to the common characteristic of these

two conceptions in the genesis of opera, namely, that in them the ideal is not

felt as unattained or nature as lost. This sentiment supposes that there was a

primitive age of man when he lay close to the heart of nature, and, owing to

this naturalness, had at once attained the ideal of mankind in a paradisiacal

goodness  and  artistry.  From  this  perfect  primitive  man  all  of  us  were

supposed to be descended. We were even supposed to be faithful copies of

him; only we had to cast off a few things in order to recognize ourselves once

more as this primitive man, on the strength of a voluntary renunciation of a

superficial learnedness, of superabundant culture. It was to such a concord of

nature and the ideal, to an idyllic reality, that the cultured Renaissance man

let himself be led back by his operatic imitation of Greek tragedy. He mad

use of this tragedy as Dante made use of Vergil, in order to be conducted to

the  gates  of  paradise;  while  from  this  point  he  continued  unassisted  and

passed over from an imitation of the highest Greek art-form to a "restoration

of all things," to an imitation of man's original art-world. What a cheerful

confidence  there  is  about  these  daring  endeavors,  in  the  very  heart  of

theoretical  culture!--solely  to  be  explained  by  the  comforting  belief,  that

"man-in-himself" is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera, the eternally

piping or singing shepherd, who must always in the end rediscover himself as

such, should he ever at any time really lost himself; to be considered solely as

the  fruit  of  that  optimism,  which  here  rises  like  a  sweetishly  seductive

column of vapor from the depth of the Socratic world view.

    Therefore,  the  features  of  the  opera  do  not  by  any  means  exhibit  the

elegiac  sorrow  of  an  eternal  loss,  but  rather  the  cheerfulness  of  eternal

rediscovery, the comfortable delight in an idyllic reality which one can at

least always imagine as real. But in this process one may some day grasp thefact that this supposed reality is nothing but a fantastically silly dawdling, at

which everyone who could judge it by the terrible seriousness of true nature,

and compare it with actual primitive scenes of the beginnings of mankind,

would be impelled to call out, nauseated: Away with the phantom!

    Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to imagine that it is possible merely

by a vigorous shout to frighten away such a playful thing as the opera, as if it

were a specter. He who would destroy the opera must take up the struggle

against Alexandrian cheerfulness, which expresses itself so na�vely in opera

concerning its favorite idea. Indeed, opera is its specific form of art. But what

may art itself expect form the operation of an art form whose beginnings lie

entirely outside of the aesthetic province and which has stolen over from a

half-moral sphere into the artistic domain, deceiving us only occasionally

about its hybrid origin? By what sap is this parasitic opera nourished, if not

by that of true art? Must we not suppose that the highest, and, indeed, the

truly serious task of art--to save the eye from gazing into the horrors of night

and to deliver the suspect by the healing balm of illusion from the spasms of

the agitations of the will--must degenerate under the influence of its idyllic

seductions  and  Alexandrian  flatteries  to  become  an  empty  and  merely

distracting diversion? What will become of the eternal truths of the Dionysian

and Apollinian when the styles are mixed in this fashion, as I have shown to

be  the  essence  of  the  stilo  rappresentativo?  A  style  in  which  music  is

regarded as the servant, the text as the master, where music is compared with

the body, the text with the soul? where at best the highest aim will be directed

toward  a  paraphrastic  tone-painting,  just  as  formerly  in  the  New  Attic

Dithyramb? where music is completely alienated from its true dignity as the

Dionysian mirror of the world, so that the only thing left to it, as the slave of

phenomena, is to imitate the formal character of phenomena, and to arouse a

superficial pleasure in the play of lines and proportions. Closely observed,

this fatal influence of the opera on music is seen to coincide exactly with the

universal development of modern music; the optimism lurking in the genesis

of the opera and in the character of the culture thereby represented, has, with

alarming  rapidity,  succeeded  in  divesting  music  of  its  Dionysian-cosmic

mission and impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character: a

change comparable to the metamorphosis of the Aeschylean man into the

cheerful Alexandrian.

  If,  however,  in  the  exemplification  here  indicated,  we  have  rightly

associated the disappearance of the Dionysian spirit with a most striking, buthitherto unexplained, transformation and degeneration of the Hellenic man--

what hopes must revive in us when the most certain auspices guarantee the

reverse process, the gradual awakening of the Dionysian spirit in our modern

world! It is impossible that the divine strength of Herakles should languish

forever in ample bondage to Omphale [A queen of Lydia by whom Herakles

claimed to have been detained for a year of bondage.]. Out of the Dionysian

root  of  the  German  spirit  a  power  has  arisen  which,  having  nothing  in

common  with  the  primitive  conditions  of  Socratic  culture,  can  neither  be

explained  nor  excused  by  it,  but  which  is  rather  felt  by  this  culture  as

something terribly inexplicable and overwhelmingly hostile--German music

as we must understand it, particularly in its vast solar orbit from Bach to

Beethoven, from Beethoven to Wagner.

  Even under the most favorable circumstances what can the knowledge-

craving Socratism of our days do with this demon rising from unfathomable

depths?  Neither  by  means  of  the  flourishes  and  arabesques  of  operatic

melody, nor with the aid of the arithmetical counting board of fugue and

contrapuntal dialectic is the formula to be found by whose thrice-powerful

light one might subdue this demon and compel it to speak. What a spectacle,

when  our  latter-day  aestheticians,  with  a  net  of  "beauty"  peculiar  to

themselves, pursue and clutch at the genius of music whirling before display

activities which are not to be judged by the standard of eternal beauty any

more than by the standard of the sublime. Let us but observe these patrons of

music  at  close  range,  as  they  really  are,  indefatigably  crying:  "Beauty!

beauty!" Do they really bear the stamp of nature's darling children who are

fostered and nourished at the breast of the beautiful, or are they not rather

seeking a mendacious cloak for their own coarseness, an aesthetical pretext

for their insensitive sobriety; here I am thinking of Otto Jahn, for example

[Professor of classical philology at Bonn.]. But let the liar and the hypocrite

beware  of  German  music:  for  amid  all  our  culture  it  is  really  the  only

genuine, pure, and purifying fire-spirit from which and toward which, as in

the teaching of the great Heraclitus of Ephesus, all things move in a double

orbit: all that we now call culture, education, civilization, must some day

appear before the unerring judge, Dionysus.

  Let us recollect further that Kant and Schopenhauer made it possible for

the spirit of German philosophy, streaming from similar sources, to destroy

scientific  Socratism's  complacent  delight  in  existence  by  establishing  its

boundaries;  how  through  this  delimitation  was  introduced  an  infinitelyprofounder and more serious view of ethical problems and of art, which we

may designate as Dionysian wisdom comprised in concepts. To what then

does the mystery of this oneness of German music and philosophy point if

not to a new form of existence, concerning whose character we can only

inform ourselves by surmise from Hellenic analogies? For to us who stand on

the  boundary  line  between  two  different  forms  of  existence,  the  Hellenic

prototype  retains  this  immeasurable  value,  that  all  these  transitions  and

struggles are imprinted upon it in a classically instructive form; except that

we,  as  it  were,  pass  through  the  chief  epochs  of  the  Hellenic  genius,

analogically  in  reverse  order,  and  seem  now,  for  instance,  to  be  passing

backward from the Alexandrian age to the period of tragedy. At the same

time we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age simply means a return

to  itself  of  the  German  spirit,  a  blessed  self-rediscovery  after  powerful

intrusive influences had for a long time compelled it, living as it did in a

helpless and unchaste barbarism, to servitude under their form. Now at last,

upon returning to the primitive source of its being, it may venture to stride

along boldly and freely before the eyes of all nations without being attached

to the lead strings of a Romanic civilization; if only it can learn constantly

from one people--the Greeks, from whom to be able to learn at all itself is a

high honor and a rare distinction. And when were we in greater need of these

highest of all teachers than at present, when we are experiencing a rebirth of

tragedy and are in danger alike of not knowing whence it comes and of being

unable to make clear to ourselves whither it tends?

  20

  Some day, before an impartial judge, it may be decided in what time and

in what men the German spirit has s far striven most resolutely to learn from

the Greeks; and if we confidently assume that this unique praise must be

accorded  to  the  noblest  intellectual  efforts  of  Goethe,  Schiller,  and

Winckelmann, we should certainly have to add that since their time and the

more  immediate  consequences  of  their  efforts,  the  endeavor  to  attain  to

culture  and  to  the  Greeks  on  the  same  path  has  grown  incomprehensibly

feebler and feebler. That we may not despair utterly of the German spirit,

must we not conclude that, in some essential manner, even these champions

did not penetrate into the core of the Hellenic nature, to establish a permanent

alliance between German and Greek culture? So an unconscious recognition

of this shortcoming may have prompted the disheartening doubt, even in very

serious people, whether after such predecessors they could possibly advancefurther on this path of culture or could reach the goal at all. Accordingly, we

see that opinions concerning the value if the Greeks for education have been

degenerating in the most alarming manner since that time. Expressions of

compassionate condescension may be heard in the most varied camps of the

spirit--and of lack of spirit. Elsewhere, ineffectual rhetoric plays with the

phrases "Greek harmony," "Greek beauty," "Greek cheerfulness." And those

very circles whose dignified task it might be to draw indefatigably from the

Greek reservoir for the good of German culture, the teachers of the higher

educational institutions, have learned best to come to terms with the Greeks

easily and in good time, often by skeptically abandoning the Hellenic ideal

and completely perverting the true purpose of antiquarian studies. Whoever

in these circles has not completely exhausted himself in his endeavor to be a

dependable  corrector  of  old  texts  or  a  linguistic  microscopist  who  apes

natural history is probably trying to assimilate Greek antiquity "historically,"

along with other antiquities, at any rate according to the method and with the

supercilious airs of our present cultured historiography.

  The  cultural  power  of  our  higher  educational  institutions  has  perhaps

never been lower or feebler than at present. The "journalist," the paper slave

of the day, triumphs over the professor in all matters pertaining to culture;

and nothing remains to the latter but the metamorphosis, often experienced

by now, of fluttering also like a cheerful cultured butterfly, with the "light

elegance" peculiar to this sphere, employing the journalist's style. In what

painful  confusion  must  the  cultured  class  of  such  a  period  gaze  at  the

phenomenon  which  perhaps  is  to  be  comprehended  analogically  only  by

means  of  the  profoundest  principle  of  the  hitherto  unintelligible  Hellenic

genius--the phenomenon of the reawakening of the Dionysian spirit and the

rebirth of tragedy?

  There has never been another period in the history of art in which so-

called culture and true art have been so estranged and opposed as we may

observe them to be at present. We can understand why so feeble a culture

hates true art; it fears destruction from its hands. But has not an entire cultural

form, namely, the Socratic-Alexandrian, exhausted itself after culminating in

such a daintily tapering point as our present culture? If heroes like Goethe

and Schiller could not succeed in breaking open the enchanted gate which

leads into the Hellenic magic mountain; if with their most dauntless striving

they could not go beyond the longing gaze which Goethe's Iphigenia casts

from barbaric Tauris to her home across the ocean, what could the epigonesof such heroes hope for--unless, amid the mystic tones of reawakened tragic

music, the gate should open for them suddenly of its own accord, from an

entirely different side, quite overlooked in all previous cultural endeavors.

  Let no one try to blight our faith in a yet-impending rebirth of Hellenic

antiquity; for this alone gives us hope for a renovation and purification of the

German spirit through the fire magic of music. What else could we name that

might awaken any comforting expectations for the future in the midst of the

desolation and exhaustion of contemporary culture? In vain we look for a

single  vigorously  developed  root,  for  a  spot  of  fertile  and  healthy  soil:

everywhere  there  is  dust  and  sand;  everything  has  become  rigid  and

languishes. One who is disconsolate and lonely could not choose a better

symbol than the knight with death and devil, as D�rer has drawn him for us,

the armored knight with the iron, hard look, who knows how to pursue his

terrible path, undeterred by his gruesome companions, and yet without hope,

alone with his horse and dog. Our Schopenhauer was such a D�rer knight;

he lacked all hope, but he desired truth. He has no peers.

  But how suddenly the desert of our exhausted culture, just described in

such gloomy terms, is changed when it is touched by the Dionysian magic! A

tempest seizes everything that has outlived itself, everything that is decayed,

broken, and withered, and, whirling, shrouds it in a cloud of red dust to carry

it  into  the  air  like  a  vulture.  Confused,  our  eyes  look  after  what  has

disappeared; for what they see has been raised as from a depression into

golden light, so full and green, so amply alive, immeasurable and full of

yearning. Tragedy is seated amid this excess of life, suffering, and pleasure,

in sublime ecstasy, listening to a distant melancholy song that tells of the

mothers of being whose names are: Delusion, Will, Woe.

  Yes, my friends, believe with me in Dionysian life and the rebirth of

tragedy. The age of the Socratic man is over; put on wreaths of ivy, put the

thyrsus into your hand, and do not be surprised when tigers and panther lie

down, fawning, at your feet. Only dare to be tragic men; for you are to be

redeemed. You shall accompany the Dionysian pageant from India to Greece.

Prepare yourselves for hard strife, but believe in the miracles of your god.

  21

    Returning from these hortatory tones to the mood befitting contemplation,

I  repeat  that  we  can  learn  only  from  the  Greeks  what  such  an  almost

miraculously  sudden  awakening  of  tragedy  means  for  the  innermost  life

ground of a people. It is the people of the tragic mysteries that fights thebattles against the Persians; and the people that fought these wars in turn

needs tragedy as a necessary potion to recover. Who would have supposed

that precisely this people, after it had been deeply agitated through several

generations  by  the  strongest  spasms  of  the  Dionysian  demon,  should  still

have  been  capable  of  such  a  uniformly  vigorous  effusion  of  the  simplest

political feeling, the most natural patriotic instincts, and original manly desire

to fight? After all, one feels in every case in which Dionysian excitement

gains any significant extent how the Dionysian liberation from the fetters of

the individual finds expression first of all in a diminution of, in indifference

to, indeed, in hostility to, the political instincts. Just as certainly, Apollo who

forms states is also the genius of the principium individuationis, and state and

patriotism cannot live without an affirmation of the individual personality.

But  from  orgies  a  people  can  take  one  path  only,  the  path  to  Indian

Buddhism, and in order that this may be endurable at all with its yearning for

the nothing, it requires these rare ecstatic states with their elevation above

space, time, and the individual. These states in turn demand a philosophy that

teaches  men  how  to  overcome  by  the  force  of  an  idea  the  indescribable

displeasure of the states that lie between. Where the political drives are taken

to be absolutely valid, it is just as necessary that a people should go to the

path toward the most extreme secularization whose most magnificent but also

most terrifying expression may be found in the Roman imperium.

  Placed between India and Rome, and pushed toward a seductive choice,

the Greeks succeeded in inventing a third form, in classical purity--to be sure,

one they did not long use themselves, but one that precisely for that reason

gained immortality. For that the favorites of the gods die early, is true in all

things; but it is just as certain that they then live eternally with the gods. After

all, one should not demand of what is noblest of all that it should have the

durable toughness of leather. That staunch perseverance which characterized,

for example, the national instincts of the Romans, probably does not belong

among the necessary predicates of perfection. But let us ask by means of

what remedy it was possible for the Greeks during their great period, in spite

of the extraordinary strength of their Dionysian and political instincts, not to

exhaust themselves either in ecstatic brooding or in a consuming chase after

worldly power and worldly honor, but rather to attain that splendid mixture

which resembles a noble wine in making one feel fiery and contemplative at

the same time. Here we must think clearly of the tremendous power that

stimulated, purified, and discharged the whole life of the people: tragedy. Wecannot begin to sense its highest value until it confronts us, as it did the

Greeks,  as  the  quintessence  of  all  prophylactic  powers  of  healing,  as  the

mediator  that  worked  among  the  strongest  and  in  themselves  most  fatal

qualities of the people.

  Tragedy absorbs the highest ecstasies of music, so that it truly brings

music, both among the Greeks and among us, to its perfection; but then it

places the tragic myth and the tragic hero next to it, and he, like a powerful

Titan, takes the whole Dionysian world upon his back and thus relieves us of

this burden. On the other hand, by means of the same tragic myth, in the

person of the tragic hero; it knows how to redeem us from the greedy thirst

for this existence, and with an admonishing gesture it reminds us of another

existence  and  a  higher  pleasure  for  which  the  struggling  hero  prepares

himself by means of his destruction, not by means of his triumphs. Between

the universal validity of its music and the listener, receptive in his Dionysian

state, tragedy places a sublime parable, the myth, and deceives the listener

into feeling that the music is merely the highest means to bring life into the

vivid world of myth. Relying on this noble deception, it may now move its

limbs in dithyrambic dances and yield unhesitatingly to an ecstatic feeling of

freedom in which it could not dare to wallow as pure music without this

deception. The myth protects us against the music, while on the other hand it

alone gives music the highest freedom. In return, music imparts to the tragic

myth  an  intense  and  convincing  metaphysical  significance  that  word  an

image without this singular help could never have attained. And above all, it

is  through  music  that  the  tragic  spectator  is  overcome  by  an  assured

premonition of a highest pleasure attained through destruction and negation,

so he feels as if the innermost abyss of things spoke to him perceptibly.

  If these last sentences have perhaps managed to give only a preliminary

expression to these difficult ideas and are immediately intelligible only to

few, I nevertheless may not desist at this point from trying to stimulate my

friends to further efforts and must ask them to use a single example of our

common experience in order to prepare themselves for a general insight. In

giving this example, I must not appeal to those who use the images of what

happens on the stage, the words and emotions of the acting persons, in order

to approach with their help the musical feeling; for these people do not speak

music as their mother tongue and, in spite of this help, never get beyond the

entrance halls of musical perception, without ever being able to as much as

touch  the  inner  sanctum.  Some  of  them,  like  Gervinus  [G.  G.  Gervinus,author of Shakespeare, and Shakespeare Commentaries], do not even reach

the entrance halls. I must appeal only to those who, immediately related to

music, have in it, as it were, their motherly womb, and are related to things

almost exclusively through unconscious musical relations. To these genuine

musicians I direct the question whether they can imagine a human being who

would be able to perceive the third act of Tristan and Isolde, without any aid

of word and image, purely as a tremendous symphonic movement, without

expiring in a spasmodic unharnessing of all the wings of the soul?

  Suppose  a  human  being  has  thus  put  his  ear,  as  it  were,  to  the  heart

chamber of the world will and felt the roaring desire for existence pouring

from there into all the veins of the world, as a thundering current or as the

gentlest brook, dissolving into a mist--how could he fail to break suddenly?

How could he endure to perceive the echo of innumerable shouts of pleasure

and woe in the "wide space of the world night," enclosed in the wretched

glass capsule of the human individual, without inexorably fleeing toward his

primordial home, as he hears this shepherd's dance of metaphysics? But if

such a work could nevertheless be perceived as a whole, without denial of

individual existence; if such a creation could be created without smashing its

creator--whence do we take the solution of such a contradiction?

  Here the tragic myth and the tragic hero intervene between our highest

musical  emotion  and  this  music--at  bottom  only  as  symbols  of  the  most

universal facts, of which only music can speak so directly. But if our feelings

were those of entirely Dionysian beings, myth as a symbol would remain

totally ineffective and unnoticed, and would never for a moment keep us

from  listening  to  the  re-echo  of  the  universalia  ante  rem  [The  universals

before the thing.]. Yet here the Apollinian power erupts to restore the almost

shattered individual with the healing balm of blissful illusion: suddenly we

imagine we see only Tristan, motionless, asking himself dully: "The old tune,

why does it wake me?" And what once seemed to us like a hollow sigh from

the core of being now merely wants to tell us how "desolate and empty the

sea." And where, breathless, we once thought we were being extinguished in

a convulsive distention of all feelings, and little remained to tie us to our

present existence, we now hear and see only the hero wounded to death, yet

not dying, with his despairing cry: "Longing! Longing! In death still longing!

for very longing not dying!" And where, formerly after such an excess and

superabundance of consuming agonies, the jubilation of the horn cut through

our hearts almost like the ultimate agony, the rejoicing Kurwenal now standsbetween us and this "jubilation in itself," his face turned toward the ship

which  carries  Isolde.  However  powerfully  pity  affects  us,  it  nevertheless

saves us in a way from the primordial suffering of the world, just as the

symbolic image of the myth saves us from the immediate perception of the

highest world-idea, just as thought and word save us from the uninhibited

effusion of the unconscious will. The glorious Apollinian illusion makes it

appear as if even the tone world confronted us as a sculpted world, as if the

fate of Tristan and Isolde had been formed and molded in it, too, as in an

exceedingly tender and expressive material.

  Thus the Apollinian tears us out of the Dionysian universality and lets us

find delight in individuals; it attaches our pity to them, and by means of them

it satisfies our sense of beauty which longs for great and sublime forms; it

presents images of life to us, and incites us to comprehend in thought the core

of life they contain. With the immense impact of the image, the concept, the

ethical teaching, and the sympathetic emotion, the Apollinian tears man from

his  orgiastic  self-annihilation  and  blinds  him  to  the  universality  of  the

Dionysian process, deluding him into the belief that he is seeing a single

image of the world (Tristan and Isolde, for instance), and that, through music,

he is merely supposed to see it still better and more profoundly. What can the

healing magic of Apollo not accomplish when it can even create the illusion

that the Dionysian is really in the service of the Apollinian and capable of

enhancing its effects--as if music were essentially the art of presenting an

Apollinian content?

  By means of the pre-established harmony between perfect drama and its

music, the drama attains a superlative vividness unattainable in mere spoken

drama. In the independently moving lines of the melody all the living figures

of the scene simplify themselves before us to the distinctness of curved lines,

and the harmonies of these lines sympathize in a most delicate manner with

the  events  on  the  stage.  These  harmonies  make  the  relations  of  things

immediately perceptible to us in a sensuous, by no means abstract manner,

and thus we perceive that it is only in these relations that the essence of a

character and of a melodic line is revealed clearly. And while music thus

compels us to see more and more profoundly than usual, and we see the

action on the stage as a delicate web, the world of the stage is expanded

infinitely and illuminated for our spiritualized eye. How could a word-poet

furnish anything analogous, when he strives to attain this internal expansion

and  illumination  of  the  visible  stage-world  by  means  of  a  much  moreimperfect  mechanism,  indirectly,  proceeding  from  word  and  concept?

Although musical tragedy also avails itself of the word, it can at the same

time place beside it the basis and origin of the word, making the development

of the word clear to us, from the inside.

    Concerning the process just described, however, we may still say with

equal  assurance  that  it  is  merely  a  glorious  appearance,  namely,  the

aforementioned Apollinian illusion whose influence aims to deliver us from

the  Dionysian  flood  and  excess.  For,  at  bottom,  the  relation  of  music  to

drama is precisely the reverse: music is the real idea of the world, drama is

but the reflection of this idea, a single silhouette of it. The identity between

the melody and the living figure, between the harmony and the character

relations of that figure, is true in a sense opposite to what one would suppose

on the contemplation of musical tragedy. Even if we agitate and enliven the

figure  in  the  most  visible  manner,  and  illuminate  it  from  within,  it  still

remains merely a phenomenon from which no bridge leads us to true reality,

into the heart of the world. But music speaks out of this heart; and though

countless phenomena of the kind were to accompany this music, they could

never  exhaust  its  essence,  but  would  always  be  nothing  more  than  its

externalized copies.

  As  for  the  intricate  relationship  of  music  and  drama,  nothing  can  be

explained, while everything may be confused, by the popular and thoroughly

false contrast of soul and body; but the unphilosophical crudeness of this

contrast  seems  to  have  become--who  knows  for  what  reasons--a  readily

accepted article of faith among our aestheticians, while they have learned

nothing  of  the  contrast  of  the  phenomenon  and  the  thing-in-itself--or,  for

equally unknown reasons, have not cared to learn anything about it.

  Should  our  analysis  have  established  that  the  Apollinian  element  in

tragedy  has  by  means  of  its  illusion  gained  a  complete  victory  over  the

primordial  Dionysian  element  of  music,  making  music  subservient  to  its

aims, namely, to make the drama as vivid as possible--it would certainly be

necessary to add a very important qualification: at the most essential point

this Apollinian illusion is broken and annihilated. The drama that, with the

aid  of  music,  unfolds  itself  before  us  with  such  inwardly  illumined

distinctness in all its movements and figures, as if we saw the texture coming

into being on the loom as the shuttle flies to and fro--attains as a whole an

effect  that  transcends  all  Apollinian  artistic  effects.  In  the  total  effect  of

tragedy, the Dionysian predominates once again. Tragedy closes with a soundwhich  could  never  come  from  the  realm  of  Apollinian  art.  And  thus  the

Apollinian illusion reveals itself as what it really is--the veiling during the

performance of the tragedy of the real Dionysian effect; but the latter is so

powerful that it ends by forcing the Apollinian drama itself into a sphere

where it begins to speak with Dionysian wisdom and even denies itself and

its Apollinian visibility. Thus the intricate relation of the Apollinian and the

Dionysian in tragedy may really be symbolized by a fraternal union of the

two deities: Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo; and Apollo, finally the

language of Dionysus and so the highest goal of tragedy and of all art is

attained.

  22

  Let the attentive friend imagine the effect of a true musical tragedy purely

and simply, as he knows it from experience. I think I have so portrayed the

phenomenon of this effect in both its phases that he can now interpret his

own experiences. For he will recollect how with regard to the myth which

passed in front of him, he felt himself exalted to a kind of omniscience, as if

his visual faculty were no longer merely a surface faculty but capable of

penetrating into the interior, and as if he now saw before him, with the aid of

music, the waves of the will, the conflict of motives, and the swelling flood

of  the  passions,  sensually  visible,  as  it  were,  like  a  multitude  of  vividly

moving lines and figures; and he felt he could dip into the most delicate

secrets of unconscious emotions. While he thus becomes conscious of the

highest  exaltation  of  his  instincts  for  clarity  and  transfiguration,  he

nevertheless feels just as definitely that this long series of Apollinian artistic

effects  still  does  not  generate  that  blessed  continuance  in  will-less

contemplation which the plastic artist and the epic poet, that is to say, the

strictly Apollinian artists, evoke in him with their artistic productions: to wit,

the  justification  of  the  world  of  the  individuatio  attained  by  this

contemplation--which is the climax and essence of Apollinian art. He beholds

the transfigured world of the stage and nevertheless denies it. He sees the

tragic hero before him in epic clearness and beauty, and nevertheless rejoices

in his annihilation. He comprehends the action deep down, and yet likes to

flee into the incomprehensible. He feels the actions of the hero to be justified,

and is nevertheless still more elated when these actions annihilate their agent.

He shudders at the sufferings which will befall the hero, and yet anticipates in

them a higher, much more overpowering joy. He sees more extensively and

profoundly than ever, and yet wishes he were blind.  How must we derive this curious internal bifurcation, this blunting of the

Apollinian point, if not from the Dionysian magic that, though apparently

exciting the Apollinian emotions to their highest pitch, still retains the power

to force into its service his excess of Apollinian force?

  The tragic myth is to be understood only as a symbolization of Dionysian

wisdom through Apollinian artifices. The myth leads the world of phenomena

to its limits where it denies itself and seeks to flee back again into the womb

of  the  true  and  only  reality,  where  it  then  seems  to  commence  its

metaphysical swansong, like Isolde:

  In the rapture ocean's

  billowing roll,

  in the fragrance waves'

  ringing sound,

  in the world breath's

  wafting whole--

  to drown, to sink--

      unconscious--highest joy!

  Thus we use the experiences of the truly aesthetic listener to bring to

mind the tragic artist himself as he creates his figures like a fecund divinity of

individuation  (so  his  work  can  hardly  be  understood  as  an  "imitation  of

nature") and as his vast Dionysian impulse then devours his entire world of

phenomena, in order to let us sense beyond it, and through its destruction, the

highest artistic primal joy, in the bosom of the primordially One. Of course

our  aestheticians  have  nothing  to  say  about  this  return  to  the  primordial

home, or the fraternal union of the two art-deities, nor of the excitement of

the hearer which is Apollinian as well as Dionysian; but they never tire of

characterizing the struggle of the hero with fate, the triumph of the moral

world order, or the purgation of the emotions through tragedy, as the essence

of the tragic. And their indefatigability makes me think that perhaps they are

not  aesthetically  sensitive  at  all,  but  react  merely  as  moral  beings  when

listening to a tragedy.

  Never since Aristotle has an explanation of the tragic effect been offered

from which aesthetic states or an aesthetic activity of the listener could be

inferred. Now the serious events are supposed to prompt pity and fear to

discharge themselves in a way that relieves us; now we are supposed to feel

elevated and inspired by the triumph of good and noble principles, at the

sacrifice of the hero in the interest of a moral vision of the universe. I am surethat for countless men precisely this, and only this, is the effect of tragedy,

but  it  plainly  follows  that  all  these  men,  together  with  their  interpreting

aestheticians, have had no experience of tragedy as a supreme art.

  The  pathological  discharge,  the  catharsis  of  Aristotle,  of  which

philologists are not sure whether it should be included among medical or

moral phenomena, recalls a remarkable notion of Goethe's. "Without a lively

pathological  interest,"  he  says,  "I,  too,  have  never  yet  succeeded  in

elaborating a tragic situation of any kind, and hence I have rather avoided

than sought it. Can it perhaps have been yet another merit of the ancients that

the deepest pathos was with them merely aesthetic play, while with us the

truth of nature must cooperate in order to produce such a work?"

  We can now answer this profound final question in the affirmative after

our glorious experiences, having found to our astonishment that the deepest

pathos can indeed be merely aesthetic play in the case of musical tragedy.

Therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time the primal

phenomenon of the tragic can be described with some degree of success.

Anyone who still persists in talking only of those vicarious effects proceeding

from  extra-aesthetic  spheres,  and  who  does  not  feel  that  he  is  above  the

pathological-moral process, should despair of his aesthetic nature: should we

recommend  to  him  as  an  innocent  equivalent  the  interpretation  of

Shakespeare after the manner of Gervinus and the diligent search for poetic

justice?

  Thus the aesthetic listener is also reborn with the rebirth of tragedy. In his

place in the theater, a curious quid pro quo used to sit with half moral and

half scholarly pretensions--the "critic." Everything in his sphere so far has

been  artificial  and  merely  whitewashed  with  an  appearance  of  life.  The

performing  artist  was  really  at  a  loss  how  to  deal  with  a  listener  who

comported himself so critically; so he, as well as the dramatist or operatic

composer who inspired him, searched anxiously for the last remains of life in

a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment. So far, however,

such "critics" have constituted the audience: the student, the schoolboy, even

the  innocuous  female  had  been  unwittingly  prepared  by  education  and

newspapers for this kind of perception of works of art. Confronted with such

a public, the nobler natures among the artists counted upon exciting their

moral-religious emotions, and the appeal to the moral world-order intervened

vicariously  where  some  powerful  artistic  magic  ought  to  enrapture  the

genuine listener. Or some more imposing, or at all events exciting, trend ofthe contemporary political and social world was so vividly presented by the

dramatist that the listener could forget his critical exhaustion and abandon

himself to emotions similar to those felt in patriotic or warlike moments, or

before the tribune of parliament, or at the condemnation of crime and vice--

an alienation from the true aims of art that sometimes had to result in an

outright cult of tendentiousness. The attempt, for example, to use the theater

as an institution for the moral education of the people, still taken seriously in

Schiller's time, is already reckoned among the incredible antiques of a dated

type  of  education.  While  the  critic  got  the  upper  hand  in  the  theater  and

concert  hall,  the  journalist  in  the  schools,  and  the  press  in  society,  art

degenerated  into  a  particularly  lowly  topic  of  conversation,  and  aesthetic

criticism  was  used  as  a  means  of  uniting  a  vain,  distracted,  selfish,  and

moreover piteously unoriginal sociability whose character is suggested by

Schopenhauer's parable of the porcupines. As a result, art has never been so

much  talked  about  and  so  little  esteemed.  But  is  it  still  possible  to  have

intercourse  with  a  person  capable  of  conversing  about  Beethoven  or

Shakespeare? Let each answer this question according to his own feelings: he

will at any rate show by his answer his conception of "culture," provided he

at  least  tries  to  answer  the  question,  and  has  not  already  become

dumbfounded with astonishment.

  On the other hand, many a being more nobly and delicately endowed by

nature,  though  he  may  have  gradually  become  a  critical  barbarian  in  the

manner described, might have something to say about the unexpected as well

as totally unintelligible effect that a successful performance of Lohengrin, for

example, had on him--except that perhaps there was no helpful interpreting

hand  to  guide  him;  so  the  incomprehensibly  different  and  altogether

incomparable  sensation  that  thrilled  him  remained  isolated  and,  like  a

mysterious star, became extinct after a short period of brilliance. But it was

then that he had an inkling of what an aesthetic listener is.

  23

  Whoever wishes to test rigorously to what extent he himself is related to

the true aesthetic listener or belongs to the community of the Socratic-critical

persons needs only to examine sincerely the feeling with which he accepts

miracles represented on the stage: whether he feels his historical sense, which

insists on strict psychological causality, insulted by them, whether he makes a

benevolent concession and admits the miracle as a phenomenon intelligible to

childhood but alien to him, or whether he experiences anything else. For inthis  way  he  will  be  able  to  determine  to  what  extent  he  is  capable  of

understanding  myth  as  a  concentrated  image  of  the  world  that,  as  a

condensation of phenomena, cannot dispense with miracles. It is probable,

however,  that  almost  everyone,  upon  close  examination,  finds  that  the

critical-historical spirit of our culture has so affected him that he can only

make  the  former  existence  of  myth  credible  to  himself  by  means  of

scholarship,  through  intermediary  abstractions.  But  without  myth  every

culture  loses  the  healthy  natural  power  of  its  creativity:  only  a  horizon

defined by myths completes and unifies a whole cultural movement. Myth

alone saves all the powers of the imagination and of the Apollinian dream

from  their  aimless  wanderings.  The  images  of  the  myth  have  to  be  the

unnoticed omnipresent demonic guardians, under whose care the young soul

grows to maturity and whose signs help the man to interpret his life and

struggles. Even the state knows no more powerful unwritten laws than the

mythical  foundation  that  guarantees  its  connection  with  religion  and  its

growth from mythical notions.

  By way of comparison let us now picture the abstract man, untutored by

myth; abstract education; abstract morality; abstract law; abstract state; let us

imagine  the  lawless  roving  of  the  artistic  imagination,  unchecked  by  any

native myth; let us think of a culture that has no fixed and sacred primordial

site but is doomed to exhaust all possibilities and to nourish itself wretchedly

on  all  other  cultures--there  we  have  the  present  age,  the  result  of  that

Socratism which is bent on the destruction of myth. And now the mythless

man stands eternally hungry, surrounded by all past ages, and digs and grubs

for roots, even if he has to dig for them among the remotest antiquities. The

tremendous historical need of our unsatisfied modern culture, the assembling

around one of countless other cultures, the consuming desire for knowledge--

what does all this point to, if not to the loss of myth, the loss of the mythical

home,  the  mythical  maternal  womb?  Let  us  ask  ourselves  whether  the

feverish and uncanny excitement of this culture is anything but the greedy

seizing  and  snatching  at  food  of  a  hungry  man--and  who  would  care  to

contribute anything to a culture that cannot be satisfied no matter how much

it  devours,  and  at  whose  contact  the  most  vigorous  and  wholesome

nourishment is changed into "history and criticism"?

  We  should  also  have  to  regard  our  German  character  with  sorrowful

despair, if it had already become inextricably entangled in, or even identical

with, its culture, as we may observe to our horror in the case of civilizedFrance. What for a long time was the great advantage of France and the cause

of her vast superiority, namely, this very identity of people and culture, might

compel  us  in  view  of  this  sight  to  congratulate  ourselves  that  this  so

questionable culture of ours has as yet nothing in common with the noble

core of our people's character? On the contrary, all our hopes stretch out

longingly  toward  the  perception  that  beneath  this  restlessly  palpitating

cultural  life  and  convulsion  there  is  concealed  a  glorious,  intrinsically

healthy, primordial power that, to be sure, stirs vigorously only at intervals in

stupendous moments, and then continues to dream of a future awakening. It

is  from  this  abyss  that  the  German  Reformation  came  forth;  and  in  its

chorales the future tune of German music resounded for the first time. So

deep,  courageous,  and  spiritual,  so  exuberantly  good  and  tender  did  this

chorale  of  Luther  sound--as  the  first  Dionysian  luring  call  breaking  forth

from dense thickets at the approach of spring. And in competing echoes the

solemnly exuberant procession of Dionysian revelers responded, to whom we

are indebted for German music--and to whom we shall be indebted for the

rebirth of German myth.

  I know that I must now lead the sympathizing and attentive friend to an

elevated  position  of  lonely  contemplation,  where  he  will  have  but  a  few

companions, and I call out encouragingly to him that we must hold fast to our

luminous  guides,  the  Greeks.  To  purify  our  aesthetic  insight,  we  have

previously borrowed from them the two divine figures who rule over separate

realms of art, and concerning whose mutual contact and enhancement we

have acquired some notion through Greek tragedy. It had to appear to us that

the demise of Greek tragedy was brought about through a remarkable and

forcible dissociation of these two primordial artistic drives. To this process

there corresponded a degeneration and transformation of the character of the

Greek people, which calls for serious reflection on how necessary and close

the  fundamental  connections  are  between  art  and  the  people,  myth  and

custom, tragedy and the state. This demise of tragedy was at the same time

the demise of myth. Until then the Greeks had felt involuntarily impelled to

relate all their experiences immediately to their myths, indeed to understand

them only in this relation. Thus even the immediate present had to appear to

them right away sub specie aeterni [Under the aspect of the eternal.] and in a

certain sense as timeless.

  But the state no less than art dipped into this current of the timeless to

find rest in it from the burden and the greed of the moment. And any people--just as, incidentally, also any individual--is worth only as much as it is able to

press upon its experiences the stamp of the eternal; for thus it is, as it were,

desecularized and shows its unconscious inward convictions of the relativity

of time and of the true, that is metaphysical, significance of life. The opposite

of this happens when a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to

smash the mythical works that surround it. At that point we generally find a

decisive  secularization,  a  break  with  the  unconscious  metaphysics  of  its

previous existence, together with all its ethical consequences. Greek art and

pre-eminently Greek tragedy delayed above all the destruction of myth. One

had to destroy tragedy, too, in order to be able to live away from the soil of

home, uninhibited, in the wilderness of thought, custom, and deed. Even now

this metaphysical drive still tries to create for itself a certainly attenuated

form of transfiguration, in the Socratism of science that strives for life; but on

the lower steps, this same drive led only to a feverish search that gradually

lost itself in a pandemonium of myths and superstitions that were collected

from all over and piled up in confusion: nevertheless the Greek sat among

them with an unstilled heart until he learned to mask this fever with Greek

cheerfulness  and  Greek  frivolity,  becoming  a  Graeculus  [A  contemptuous

term for a Greek.], or he numbed his mind completely in some dark Oriental

superstition.

  Since the reawakening of Alexandrian-Roman antiquity in the fifteenth

century we have approximated this state in the most evident manner, after a

long interlude that is difficult to describe. On the heights we encounter the

same  overabundant  lust  for  knowledge,  the  same  unsatisfied  delight  in

discovery,  the  same  tremendous  secularization,  and  beside  it  a  homeless

roving, a greedy crowding around foreign tables, a frivolous deification of the

present, or a dully dazed retreat--everything sub specie saeculi [Under the

aspect of the times, or the spirit of the age.], of the "present age." And these

same symptoms allow us to infer the same lack at the heart of this culture, the

destruction of myth. It scarcely seems possible to be continuously successful

at transplanting a foreign myth without irreparably damaging the tree by this

transplantation. In one case it may perhaps be strong and healthy enlugh to

eliminate this foreign element in a terrible fight; usually, however, it must

consume itself, sick and withered or in diseased superfoetation.

  We think so highly of the pure and vigorous core of the German character

that we dare to expect of it above all others this elimination of the forcibly

implanted foreign elements, and consider it possible that the German spiritwill return to itself. Some may suppose that this spirit must begin its fight

with the elimination of everything Romanic. If so they may recognize an

external  preparation  and  encouragement  in  the  victorious  fortitude  and

bloody glory of the last war; but one must still seek the inner necessity in the

ambition to be always worthy of the sublime champions on this way, Luther

as well as our great artists and poets. But let him never believe that he could

fight  similar  fights  without  the  gods  of  his  house,  or  his  mythical  home,

without  "bringing  back"  all  German  things!  And  if  the  German  should

hesitantly look around for a leader who might bring him back again into his

long lost home whose ways and paths he scarcely knows anymore, let him

merely listen to the ecstatically luring call of the Dionysian bird that hovers

above him and wants to point the way for him.

  24

  Among the peculiar art effects of musical tragedy we had to emphasize an

Apollinian illusion by means of which we were supposed to be saved from

the  immediate  unity  with  Dionysian  music,  while  our  musical  excitement

could  discharge  itself  in  an  Apollinian  field  and  in  relation  to  a  visible

intermediary world that had been interposed. At the same time we thought

that we had observed how precisely through this discharge the intermediary

world of the action on the stage, and the drama in general, had been made

visible and intelligible form the inside to a degree that in all other Apollinian

art remains unattained. Where the Apollinian receives wings from the spirit

of music and soars, we thus found the highest intensification of its powers,

and in this fraternal union of Apollo and Dionysus we had to recognize the

apex of the Apollinian as well as the Dionysian aims of art.

  To be sure, the Apollinian projection that is thus illuminated from inside

by  music  does  not  achieve  the  peculiar  effect  of  the  weaker  degrees  of

Apollinian art. What the epic or the animated stone can do, compelling the

contemplative eye to find calm delight in the world of individuation, that

could not be attained here, in spite of a higher animation and clarity. We

looked  at  the  drama  and  with  penetrating  eye  reached  its  inner  world  of

motives--and  yet  we  felt  as  if  only  a  parable  passed  us  by,  whose  most

profound meaning we almost thought we could guess and that we wished to

draw away like a curtain in order to behold the primordial image behind it.

The brightest clarity of the image did not suffice us, for this seemed to wish

just as much to reveal something as to conceal something. Its revelation,

being like a parable, seemed to summon us to teat the veil and to uncover themysterious  background;  but  at  the  same  time  this  all-illuminated  total

visibility  cast  a  spell  over  the  eyes  and  prevented  them  from  penetrating

deeper.

  Those who have never had the experience of having to see at the same

time that they also longed to transcend all seeing will scarcely be able to

imagine how definitely and clearly these two processes coexist and are felt at

the same time, as one contemplates the tragic myth. But all truly aesthetic

spectators  will  confirm  that  among  the  peculiar  effects  of  tragedy  this

coexistence is the most remarkable. Now transfer this phenomenon of the

aesthetic spectator into an analogous process in the tragic artist, and you will

have  understood  the  genesis  of  the  tragic  myth.  With  the  Apollinian  art

sphere he shares the complete pleasure in mere appearance and in seeing, yet

at the same time he negates this pleasure and finds a still higher satisfaction

in the destruction of the visible world of mere appearance.

  The content of the tragic myth is , first of all, an epic event and the

glorification of the fighting hero. But what is the origin of this enigmatic trait

that the suffering and the fate of the hero, the most painful triumphs, the most

agonizing  oppositions  of  motives,  in  short,  the  exemplification  of  this

wisdom  of  Silenus,  or,  to  put  it  aesthetically,  that  which  is  ugly  and

disharmonic, is represented ever anew in such countless forms and with such

a distinct preference--and precisely in the most fruitful and youthful period of

a people? Surely a higher pleasure must be perceived in all this.

  That life really so tragic would least of all explain the origin of an art

form--assuming that art is not merely imitation of the reality of nature but

rather a metaphysical supplement of the reality of nature, placed beside it for

its  overcoming.  The  tragic  myth  too,  insofar  as  it  belongs  to  art  at  all,

participates fully in this metaphysical intention of art to transfigure. But what

does it transfigure when it presents the world of appearance in the image of

the suffering hero? Least of all the "reality" of this world of appearance, for it

says to us: "Look there! Look closely! This is your life, this is the hand on the

clock of your existence."

  And the myth should show us this life in order to thus transfigure it? But

if not, in what then lies the aesthetic pleasure with which we let these images,

too, pass before us? I asked about the aesthetic pleasure, though I know full

well that many of these images also produce at times a moral delight, for

example, under the form of pity or moral triumph. But those who would

derive the effect of the tragic solely from these moral sources--which, to besure, has been the custom in aesthetics all too long--should least of all believe

that they have thus accomplished something for art, which above all must

demand purity in its sphere. If you would explain the tragic myth, the first

requirement is to seek the pleasure that is peculiar to it in the purely aesthetic

sphere,  without  transgressing  into  the  region  of  pity,  fear,  or  the  morally

sublime. How can the ugly and the disharmonic, the content of the tragic

myth, stimulate aesthetic pleasure?

  Here it becomes necessary to take a bold running start and leap into a

metaphysics of art, by repeating the sentence written above [Section 5], that

existence and thee world seem justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. In

this sense, it is precisely the tragic myth that has to convince us that even the

ugly and disharmonic are part of an artistic game that the will in the eternal

amplitude of its pleasure plays with itself. But this primordial phenomenon of

Dionysian art is difficult to grasp, and there is only one direct way to make it

intelligible and grasp it immediately: through the wonderful significance of

musical dissonance. Quite generally, only music, placed beside the world,

can give us an idea of what is meant by the justification of the world as an

aesthetic  phenomenon.  The  joy  aroused  by  the  tragic  myth  has  the  same

origin as the joyous sensation of dissonance in music. The Dionysian, with its

primordial joy experienced even in pain, is the common source of music and

tragic myth.

  Is  it  not  possible  that  by  calling  to  our  aid  the  musical  relation  of

dissonance we may meanwhile have made the difficult problem of the tragic

effect much easier? For we now understand what it means to wish to see

tragedy and at the same time to long to get beyond all seeing: referring to the

artistically  employed  dissonances,  we  should  have  to  characterize  the

corresponding state by saying that we desire to hear and at the same time

long to get beyond all hearing. The striving for the infinite, the wing-beat of

longing  that  accompanies  the  highest  delight  in  clearly  perceived  reality,

reminds us that in both states we must recognize a Dionysian phenomenon:

again and again it reveals to us the playful construction and destruction of the

individual  world  as  the  overflow  of  a  primordial  delight.  Thus  the  dark

Heraclitus compares the world-building force to a playing child that places

stones here and there and builds sand hills only to overthrow them again.

  In order, then, to form a true estimate of the Dionysian capacity of a

people, we must not only think of their music, but also just as necessarily of

their tragic myth, as the second witness of this capacity. Considering thisextremely close relationship between music and myth, one must suppose that

a degeneration and depravation of the one will involve a deterioration of the

other,  if  the  weakening  of  the  myth  really  expresses  a  weakening  of  the

Dionysian capacity. Concerning both, however, a glance at the development

of the German character should not leave us in any doubt. In the opera, just as

in the abstract character of our mythless existence, in an art degenerated to

mere entertainment as will as in a life guided by concepts, the inartistic as

well as life-consuming nature of Socratic optimism had revealed itself to us.

Yet we were comforted by indications that nevertheless in some inaccessible

abyss  the  German  spirit  still  rests  and  dreams,  undestroyed,  in  glorious

health, profundity and Dionysian strength, like a knight sunk in slumber; and

from this abyss the Dionysian song rises to our ears to let us know that this

German knight is still dreaming his primordial Dionysian myth in blissfully

serious visions. Let no one believe that the German spirit has forever lost its

mythical home when it can sill understand so plainly the voices of the birds

that tell of that home. Some day it will find itself awake in all the morning

freshness following a tremendous sleep: then it will slay dragons, destroy

vicious dwarfs, wake Br�nhilde--and even Wotan's spear will not be able to

stop this course!

  My friends, you who believe in Dionysian music, you also know what

tragedy means to us. There we have tragic myth reborn from music--and in

this myth we can hope for everything and forget what is most painful. What

is most painful for all of us, however, is--the prolonged degradation in which

the German genius has lived, estranged from house and home, in the service

of vicious dwarfs. You understand my words--as you will also, in conclusion,

understand my hopes.

  25

  Music and tragic myth are equally expressions of the Dionysian capacity

of a people, and they are inseparable. Both derive from a sphere of art that

lies beyond the Apollinian; both transfigure a region in whose joyous chords

dissonance as well as the terrible image of the world fade away charmingly;

both play with the sting of displeasure, trusting in their exceedingly powerful

magic arts; and by means of this play both justify the existence of even the

"worst world." Thus the Dionysian is seen to be, compared to the Apollinian,

the  eternal  and  original  artistic  power  that  first  calls  the  whole  world  of

phenomena into existence--and it is only in the midst of this world that a new

transfiguring illusion becomes necessary in order to keep the animated worldof individuation alive.

  If we could imagine dissonance become man--and what else is man?--this

dissonance, to be able to live, would need a splendid illusion that would

cover dissonance with a veil of beauty. This is the true artistic aim of Apollo

in whose name we comprehend all those countless illusions of the beauty of

mere  appearance  that  at  every  moment  make  life  worth  living  at  all  and

prompt the desire to live on in order to experience the next moment.

  Of this foundation of all existence--the Dionysian basic ground of the

world--not  one  whit  more  may  enter  the  consciousness  of  the  human

individual  than  can  be  overcome  again  by  this  Apollinian  power  of

transfiguration. Thus these two art drives must unfold their powers in a strict

proportion,  according  to  the  law  of  eternal  justice.  Where  the  Dionysian

powers rise up as impetuously as we experience them now, Apollo, too, must

already  have  descended  among  us,  wrapped  in  a  cloud;  and  the  next

generation will probably behold his most ample beautiful effects.

  That this effect should be necessary, everybody should be able to feel

most assuredly by means of intuition, provided he has ever felt, if only in a

dream, that he was carried back into an ancient Greek existence. Walking

under lofty Ionic colonnades, looking up toward a horizon that was cut off by

pure  and  noble  lines,  finding  reflections  of  his  transfigured  shape  in  the

shining marble at his side, and all around him solemnly striding or delicately

moving human beings, speaking with harmonious voices and in a rhythmic

language of gestures--in view of this continual influx of beauty, would he not

have to exclaim, raising his hand to Apollo: "Blessed people of Hellas! How

great must Dionysus be among you if the god of Delos considers such magic

necessary to heal your dithyrambic madness!"

  To a man in such a mood, however, an old Athenian, looking up at him

with the sublime eyes of Aeschylus, might reply: "But say this, too, curious

stranger: how much did this people have to suffer to be able to become so

beautiful! But now follow me to witness a tragedy, and sacrifice with me in

the temple of both deities!"



        PHILOSOPHY DURING THE TRAGIC AGE OF THE GREEKS

                                Translated by M Mugge

  (circa 1874)

  IF we know the aims of humans who are strangers to us, it is sufficientfor us to approve of or condemn them as wholes. Those who stand nearer to

us we judge according to the means by which they further their aims; we

often disapprove of their aims, but love them for the sake of their means and

the style of their volition. Now philosophical systems are absolutely true only

to their founders, to all later philosophers they are usually one big mistake,

and to feebler minds a sum of mistakes and truths; at any rate if regarded as

highest aim they are an error, and in so far reprehensible. Therefore many

disapprove of all philosophers, because their aims are not ours; they are those

whom I called " strangers to us." Whoever on the contrary finds any pleasure

at all in great humans finds pleasure also in such systems, be they ever so

erroneous, for they all have in them one point which is irrefutable, a personal

touch,  and  color;  one  can  use  them  in  order  to  form  a  picture  of  the

philosopher, just as from a plant growing in a certain place one can form

conclusions as to the soil. That mode of life, of viewing human affairs at any

rate, has existed once and is therefore possible; the "system" is the growth in

this  soil  or  at  least  a  part  of  this  system....I  narrate  the  history  of  those

philosophers  simplified:  I  shall  bring  into  relief  only  that  point  in  every

system  which  is  a  little  bit  of  personality,  and  belongs  to  that  which  is

irrefutable,  and  indiscussable,  which  history  has  to  preserve:  it  is  a  first

attempt to regain and recreate those natures by comparison, and to let the

polyphony of Greek nature at least resound once again: the task is, to bring to

light  that  which  we  must  always  love  and  revere  and  of  which  no  later

knowledge can rob us: the great human.

  LATER

  (Towards the end of 1879)

  THIS  attempt  to  relate  the  history  of  the  earlier  Greek  philosophers

distinguishes  itself  from  similar  attempts  by  its  brevity.  This  has  been

accomplished by mentioning but a small number of the doctrines of every

philosopher,  ie.,  by  incompleteness.  Those  doctrines,  however,  have  been

selected in which the personal element of the philosopher re echoes most

strongly; whereas a complete enumeration of all possible propositions handed

down to us -- as is the custom in text books-merely brings about one thing,

the absolute silencing of the personal element. It is through this that those

records become so tedious; for in systems which have been refuted it is only

this  personal  element  that  can  still  interest  us,  for  this  alone  is  eternally

irrefutable.  It  is  possible  to  shape  the  picture  of  a  person  out  of  three

anecdotes. I endeavor to bring into relief three anecdotes out of every systemand abandon the remainder.

  There are opponents of philosophy, and one does well to listen to them;

especially  if  they  dissuade  the  distempered  heads  of  Germans  from

metaphysics  and  on  the  other  hand  preach  to  them  purification  through

Physis, as Goethe did,or healing through Music, as Wagner. The physicians

of the people condemn philosophy; one, therefore, who wants to justify it,

must show to what purpose healthy nations use and have used philosophy. If

one can show that, perhaps even the sick people will benefit by learning why

philosophy is harmful just to them. There are indeed good instances of a

health  which  can  exist  without  any  philosophy  or  with  quite  a  moderate,

almost a toying use of it; thus the Romans at their best period lived without

philosophy.  But  where  is  to  be  found  the  instance  of  a  nation  becoming

diseased whom philosophy had restored to health ? Whenever philosophy

showed itself helping, saving, prophylactic, it was with healthy people; it

made sick people still more ill. If ever a nation was disintegrated and but

loosely connected with the individuals, never has philosophy bound these

individuals closer to the whole. If ever an individual was willing to stand

aside and plant around oneself the hedge of self sufficiency, philosophy was

always ready to isolate one still more and to destroy one through isolation.

She is dangerous where she is not in her full right, and it is only the health of

a nation but not that of every nation which gives her this right.

  Let us now look around for the highest authority as to what constitutes the

health of a nation. The Greeks, as the truly healthy nation, have justified

philosophy once for all by having philosophised; and that indeed more than

all other nations. They could not even stop at the right time, for still in their

withered age they comported themselves as heated votaries of philosophy,

although they understood by it only the pious sophistries and the sacrosanct

hairsplittings of Christian dogmatics. They themselves have much lessened

their merit for barbarian posterity by not being able to stop at the right time,

because that posterity in its uninstructed and impetuous youth necessarily

became entangled in those artfully woven nets and ropes.

  On the contrary, the Greek knew how to begin at the right time, and this

lesson, when one ought to begin philosophising,they teach more distinctly

than any other nation. For it should not be begun when trouble comes as

perhaps some presume who derive philosophy from moroseness; no, but in

good fortune, in mature adulthood, out of the midst of the fervent serenity of

a  brave  and  victorious  individual's  estate.  The  fact  that  the  Greeksphilosophised at that time throws light on the nature of philosophy and her

task as well as on the nature of the Greeks themselves. Had they at that time

been such common sense and precocious experts and gayards as the learned

Philistine of our days perhaps imagines, or had their life been only a state of

voluptuous  soaring,  chiming,  breathing  and  feeling,  as  the  unlearned

visionary is pleased to assume, then the spring of philosophy would not have

come to light among them. At the best there would have come forth a brook

soon trickling away in the sand or evaporating into fogs, but never that broad

river flowing forth with the proud beat of its waves, the river which we know

as Greek Philosophy.

  True, it has been eagerly pointed out how much the Greeks could find and

learn abroad,in the Orient, and how many different things they may easily

have brought from there. Of course an odd spectacle resulted, when certain

scholars  brought  together  the  alleged  masters  from  the  Orient  and  the

possible disciples from Greece, and exhibited Zarathustra near Heraclitus, the

Hindoos  near  the  Eleatics,  the  Egyptians  near  Empedocles,  or  even

Anaxagoras among the Jews and Pythagoras among the Chinese. In detail

little has been determined; but we should in no way object to the general idea,

if people did not burden us with the conclusion that therefore Philosophy had

only been imported into Greece and was not indigenous to the soil, yea, that

she,  as  something  foreign,  had  possibly  ruined  rather  than  improved  the

Greek. Nothing is more foolish than to swear by the fact that the Greeks had

an autochthonous culture; no, they rather absorbed all the culture flourishing

among other nations, and they advanced so far, just because they understood

how to hurl the spear further from the very spot where another nation had let

it rest. They were admirable in the art of learning productively, and so, like

them,  we  ought  to  learn  from  our  neighbors,  with  a  view  to  Life  not  to

pedantic knowledge, using everything learnt as a foothold whence to leap

high and still higher than our neighbor. The questions as to the beginning of

philosophy are quite negligible, for everywhere in the beginning there is the

crude, the unformed, the empty and the ugly; and in all things only the higher

stages come into consideration. He who in the place of Greek philosophy

prefers to concern himself with that of Egypt and Persia, because the latter

are perhaps more "original" and certainly older, proceeds just as ill advisedly

as  those  who  cannot  be  at  ease  before  they  have  traced  back  the  Greek

mythology,  so  grand  and  profound,  to  such  physical  trivialities  as  sun,

lightning, weather and fog, as its prime origins, and who fondly imagine theyhave rediscovered for instance in the restricted worship of the one celestial

vault  among  the  other  Indo  Germans  a  purer  form  of  religion  than  the

polytheistic worship of the Greek had been. The road towards the beginning

always leads into barbarism, and he who is concerned with the Greeks ought

always to keep in mind the fact that the unsubdued thirst for knowledge in

itself always barbarises just as much as the hatred of knowledge, and that the

Greeks have subdued their inherently insatiable thirst for knowledge by their

regard  for  Life,  by  an  ideal  need  of  Life,-since  they  wished  to  live

immediately that which they learnt. The Greeks also philosophised as people

of culture and with the aims of culture,and therefore saved themselves the

trouble of inventing once again the elements of philosophy and knowledge

out  of  some  autochthonous  conceit,  and  with  a  will  they  at  once  set

themselves to fill out, enhance, raise and purify these elements they had taken

over in such a way, that only now in a higher sense and in a purer sphere they

became inventors. For they discovered the typical philosopher's genius, and

the inventions of all posterity have added nothing essential.

  Every  nation  is  put  to  shame  if  one  points  out  such  a  wonderfully

idealised company of philosophers as that of the early Greek masters, Thales,

Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Democritus

and Socrates. All those men are integral, entire and self contained, and hewn

out of one stone. Severe necessity exists between their thinking and their

character. They are not bound by any convention, because at that time no

professional class of philosophers and scholars existed. They all stand before

us  in  magnificent  solitude  as  the  only  ones  who  then  devoted  their  life

exclusively  to  knowledge.  They  all  possess  the  virtuous  energy  of  the

Ancients, whereby they excel all the later philosophers in finding their own

form and in perfecting it by metamorphosis in its most minute details and

general aspect. For they were met by no helpful and facilitating fashion. Thus

together  they  form  what  Schopenhauer,  in  opposition  to  the  Republic  of

Scholars, has called a Republic of Geniuses; one giant calls to another across

the arid intervals of ages, and, undisturbed by a wanton noisy race of dwarfs,

creeping about beneath them, the sublime intercourse of spirits continues.

  Of this sublime intercourse of spirits I have resolved to relate those items

which our modern hardness of hearing might perhaps hear and understand;

that means certainly the least of all. It seems to me that those old sages from

Thales to Socrates have discussed in that intercourse, although in its most

general  aspect,  everything  that  constitutes  for  our  contemplation  thepeculiarly Hellenic. In their intercourse, as already in their personalities, they

express distinctly the great features of Greek genius of which the whole of

Greek history is a shadowy impression, a hazy copy, which consequently

speaks less clearly. If we could rightly interpret the total life of the Greek

nation, we should ever find reflected only that picture which in her highest

geniuses shines with more resplendent colors. Even the first experience of

philosophy on Greek soil, the sanction of the Seven Sages is a distinct and

unforgettable  line  in  the  picture  of  the  Hellenic.  Other  nations  have  their

Saints,  the  Greeks  have  Sages.  Rightly  it  has  been  said  that  a  nation  is

characterised not only by her great citizens but rather by the manner in which

she  recognises  and  honors  them.  In  other  ages  the  philosopher  is  an

accidental solitary wanderer in the most hostile environment, either slinking

through or pushing through with clenched fists. With the Greek however the

philosopher is not accidental; when in the Sixth and Fifth centuries amidst the

most  frightful  dangers  and  seductions  of  secularisation  the  philosopher

appears and as it were steps forth from the cave of Trophonios into the very

midst  of  luxuriance,  the  discoverers'  happiness,  the  wealth  and  the

sensuousness of the Greek colonies, then we divine that they come as noble

warners for the same purpose for which in those centuries Tragedy was born

and which the Orphic mysteries in their grotesque hieroglyphics give us to

understand.  The  opinion  of  those  philosophers  on  Life  and  Existence

altogether means so much more than a modern opinion because they had

before  themselves  Life  in  a  luxuriant  perfection,  and  because  with  them,

unlike  us,  the  sense  of  the  thinker  was  not  muddled  by  the  disunion

engendered by the wish for freedom, beauty, fullness of life and the love for

truth that only asks: What is the good of Life at all ~ The mission which the

philosopher  has  to  discharge  within  a  real  Culture,  fashioned  in  a

homogeneous style, cannot be clearly conjectured out of our circumstances

and experiences for the simple reason that we have no such culture. No, it is

only a Culture like the Greek which can answer the question as to that task of

the philosopher, only such a Culture can, as I said before, justify philosophy

at all; because such a Culture alone knows and can demonstrate why and how

the philosopher is not an accidental, chance wanderer driven now hither, now

thither. There is a steely necessity which fetters the philosopher to a true

Culture: but what if this Culture does not exist. Then philosophers are an

incalculable and therefore terror inspiring comets, whereas in the favorable

case, they shine as the central star in the solar system of culture. It is for thisreason that the Greeks justify the philosopher, because with them they are no

comets.2

  After such contemplations it will be accepted without offense if I speak of

the pre Platonic philosophers as of a homogeneous company, and devote this

paper  to  them  exclusively.  Something  quite  new  begins  with  Plato;  or  it

might be said with equal justice that in comparison with that Republic of

Geniuses  from  Thales  to  Socrates,  the  philosophers  since  Plato  lack

something essential.

  Whoever wants to express himself unfavorably about those older masters

may call them one sided, and their Epigones, with Plato as head, many sided.

Yet  it  would  be  more  just  and  unbiased  to  conceive  of  the  latter  as

philosophic hybrid characters, of the former as the pure types. Plato himself

is the first magnificent hybrid character, and as such finds expression as well

in his philosophy as in his personality. In his ideology are united Socratic,

Pythagorean, and Heraclitean elements, and for this reason it is no typically

pure phenomenon. As person, too, Plato mingles the features of the royally

secluded,  all-sufficing  Heraclitus,  of  the  melancholy  compassionate  and

legislatory  Pythagoras  and  of  the  psycho-expert  dialectician  Socrates.  All

later  philosophers  are  such  hybrid�characters;  wherever  something  one

sided does come into prominence with them as in the case of the Cynics, it is

not type but caricature. Much more important however is the fact that they

are founders of sects and that the sects founded by them are all institutions in

direct opposition to the Hellenic culture and the unity of its style prevailing

up  to  that  time.  In  their  way  they  seek  a  redemption,  but  only  for  the

individuals or at the best for groups of friends and disciples closely connected

with them. The activity of the older philosophers tends, although they were

unconscious of it, towards a cure and purification on a large scale; the mighty

course of Greek culture is not to be stopped; awful dangers are to be removed

out of the way of its current; the philosopher protects and defends his native

country. Now, since Plato, he is in exile and conspires against his fatherland.

  It is a real misfortune that so very little of those older philosophic masters

has come down to us and that all complete works of theirs are withheld from

us. Involuntarily,on account of that loss,we measure them according to wrong

standards and allow ourselves to be influenced unfavorably towards them by

the mere accidental fact that Plato and Aristotle never lacked appreciators and

copyists. Some people presuppose a special providence for books, a fatum

libellorum; such a providence however would at any rate be a very maliciousone  if  it  deemed  it  wise  to  withhold  from  us  the  works  of  Heraclitus,

Empedocles'  wonderful  poem,  and  the  writings  of  Democritus,  whom  the

ancients put on a par with Plato, whom he even excels as far as ingenuity

goes, and as a substitute put into our hand Stoics, Epicureans and Cicero.

Probably the most sublime part of Greek thought and its expression in words

is  lost  to  us;  a  fate  which  will  not  surprise  the  man  who  remembers  the

misfortunes of Scotus Erigena or of Pascal, and who considers that even in

this enlightened century the first edition of Schopenhauer's The World As

Will And Representation became waste paper. If somebody will presuppose a

special fatalistic power with respect to such things he may do so and say with

Goethe: " Let no one complain about and grumble at things vile and mean,

they are the real rulers,-however much this be gainsaid!" In particular they

are more powerful than the power of truth, Mankind very rarely produces a

good book in which with daring freedom is intonated the battle song of truth,

the song of philosophic heroism; and yet whether it is to live a century longer

or  to  crumble  and  moulder  into  dust  and  ashes,  depends  on  the  most

miserable  accidents,  on  the  sudden  mental  eclipse  of  people's  heads,  on

superstitious convulsions and antipathies, finally on fingers not too fond of

writing or even on eroding bookworms and rainy weather. But we will not

lament but rather take the advice of the reproving and consolatory words

which Hamann addresses to scholars who lament over lost works. "Would

not the artist who succeeded in throwing a lentil through the eye of a needle

have sufficient, with a bushel of lentils, to practice his acquired skill? One

would like to put this question to all scholars who do not know how to use

the works of the Ancients any better than that man used his lentils." It might

be added in our case that not one more word, anecdote, or date needed to be

transmitted to us than has been transmitted, indeed that even much less might

have been preserved for us and yet we should have been able to establish the

general doctrine that the Greeks justify philosophy.

  A time which suffers from the so called " general education" but has no

culture  and  no  unity  of  style  in  her  life  hardly  knows  what  to  do  with

philosophy, even if the latter were proclaimed by the very Genius of Truth in

the streets and market places. She rather remains at such a time the learned

monologue of the solitary rambler, the accidental booty of the individual, the

hidden closet�secret or the innocuous chatter between academic senility and

childhood.

  Nobody dare venture to fulfill in oneself the law of philosophy, nobodylives  philosophically,  with  that  simple  human  faith  which  compelled  an

Ancient, wherever one was, whatever one did, to deport oneself as a Stoic,

when one had once pledged one's faith to the Stoa. All modern philosophising

is  limited  politically  and  regulated  by  the  police  to  learned  semblance.

Thanks  to  governments,  churches,  academies,  customs,  fashions,  and  the

cowardice of people, it never gets beyond the sigh: " If only! . . ." or beyond

the knowledge: " Once upon a time there was . . ." Philosophy is without

rights;  therefore  modern  humans,  if  they  were  at  all  courageous  and

conscientious,  ought  to  condemn  her  and  perhaps  banish  her  with  words

similar to those by which Plato banished the tragic poets from his State. Of

course there would be left a reply for her, as there remained to those poets

against Plato. If one once compelled her to speak out she might say perhaps:

"Miserable Nation! Is it my fault if among you I am on the tramp, like a

fortune teller through the land, and must hide and disguise myself, as if I

were a great sinner and ye my judges 7 Just look at my sister, Art! It is with

her as with me; we have been cast adrift among the Barbarians and no longer

know how to save ourselves. Here we are lacking, it is true, every good right;

but the judges before whom we find justice judge you also and will tell you:

First acquire a culture; then you shall experience what Philosophy can and

will do."-

              ON TRUTH AND LIES IN A NON MORAL SENSE

                                Translated by M Mugge

  Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is

dispersed  into  numberless  twinkling  solar  systems,  there  was  a  star  upon

which  clever  beasts  invented  knowing.  That  was  the  most  arrogant  and

mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute.

After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and theclever beasts had to die. _One might invent such a fable, and yet he still

would  not  have  adequately  illustrated  how  miserable,  how  shadowy  and

transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature.

There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over

with the human intellect, nothing will have happened. For this intellect has no

additional  mission  which  would  lead  it  beyond  human  life.  Rather,  it  is

human, and only its possessor and begetter takes it so solemnly-as though the

world's axis turned within it. But if we could communicate with the gnat, we

would learn that he likewise flies through the air with the same solemnity,

that he feels the flying center of the universe within himself. There is nothing

so reprehensible and unimportant in nature that it would not immediately

swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff of this power of knowing. And

just as every porter wants to have an admirer, so even the proudest of men,

the philosopher, supposes that he sees on all sides the eyes of the universe

telescopically focused upon his action and thought.

  It is remarkable that this was brought about by the intellect, which was

certainly allotted to these most unfortunate, delicate, and ephemeral beings

merely as a device for detaining them a minute within existence.For without

this addition they would have every reason to flee this existence as quickly as

Lessing's  son.  The  pride  connected  with  knowing  and  sensing  lies  like  a

blinding  fog  over  the  eyes  and  senses  of  men,  thus  deceiving  them

concerning the value of existence. For this pride contains within itself the

most flattering estimation of the value of knowing. Deception is the most

general  effect  of  such  pride,  but  even  its  most  particular  effects  contain

within themselves something of the same deceitful character.

  As a means for the preserving of the individual, the intellect unfolds its

principle powers in dissimulation, which is the means by which weaker, less

robust  individuals  preserve  themselves-since  they  have  been  denied  the

chance to wage the battle for existence with horns or with the sharp teeth of

beasts of prey, This art of dissimulation reaches its peak in man. Deception,

flattering, lying, deluding, talking behind the back, putting up a false front,

living  in  borrowed  splendor,  wearing  a  mask,  hiding  behind  convention,

playing  a  role  for  others  and  for  oneself-in  short,  a  continuous  fluttering

around the solitary flame of vanity-is so much the rule and the law among

men that there is almost nothing which is less comprehensible than how an

honest  and  pure  drive  for  truth  could  have  arisen  among  them.  They  are

deeply immersed in illusions and in dream images; their eyes merely glideover the surface of things and see "forms." Their senses nowhere lead to

truth; on the contrary, they are content to receive stimuli and, as it were, to

engage in a groping game on the backs of things. Moreover, man permits

himself  to  be  deceived  in  his  dreams  every  night  of  his  life.  His  moral

sentiment does not even make an attempt to prevent this, whereas there are

supposed to be men who have stopped snoring through sheer will power.

What does man actually know about himself? Is he, indeed, ever able to

perceive himself completely, as if laid out in a lighted display case? Does

nature not conceal most things from him-even concerning his own body-in

order to confine and lock him within a proud, deceptive consciousness, aloof

from the coils of the bowels, the rapid flow of the blood stream, and the

intricate quivering of the fibers! She threw away the key. And woe to that

fatal curiosity which might one day have the power to peer out and down

through a crack in the chamber of consciousness and then suspect that man is

sustained in the indifference of his ignorance by that which is pitiless, greedy,

insatiable, and murderous-as if hanging in dreams on the back of a tiger.

Given this situation, where in the world could the drive for truth have come

from?

  Insofar  as  the  individual  wants  to  maintain  himself  against  other

individuals, he will under natural circumstances employ the intellect mainly

for dissimulation. But at the same time, from boredom and necessity, man

wishes to exist socially and with the herd; therefore, he needs to make peace

and strives accordingly to banish from his world at least the most flagrant

bellum omni contra omnes. This peace treaty brings in its wake something

which appears to be the first step toward acquiring that puzzling truth drive:

to wit, that which shall count as "truth" from now on is established. That is to

say, a uniformly valid and binding designation is invented for things, and this

legislation of language likewise establishes the first laws of truth. For the

contrast  between  truth  and  lie  arises  here  for  the  first  time.  The  liar  is  a

person  who  uses  the  valid  designations,  the  words,  in  order  to  make

something which is unreal appear to be real. He says, for example, "I am

rich," when the proper designation for his condition would be "poor." He

misuses  fixed  conventions  by  means  of  arbitrary  substitutions  or  even

reversals of names. If he does this in a selfish and moreover harmful manner,

society will cease to trust him and will thereby exclude him. What men avoid

by excluding the liar is not so much being defrauded as it is being harmed by

means  of  fraud.  Thus,  even  at  this  stage,  what  they  hate  is  basically  notdeception itself, but rather the unpleasant, hated consequences of certain sorts

of deception. It is in a similarly restricted sense that man now wants nothing

but truth: he desires the pleasant, life-preserving consequences of truth. He is

indifferent toward pure knowledge which has no consequences; toward those

truths  which  are  possibly  harmful  and  destructive  he  is  even  hostilely

inclined. And besides, what about these linguistic conventions themselves?

Are they perhaps products of knowledge, that is, of the sense of truth? Are

designations congruent with things? Is language the adequate expression of

all realities?

  It is only by means of forgetfulness that man can ever reach the point of

fancying himself to possess a "truth" of the grade just indicated. If he will not

be satisfied with truth in the form of tautology, that is to say, if he will not be

content with empty husks, then he will always exchange truths for illusions.

What is a word? It is the copy in sound of a nerve stimulus. But the further

inference from the nerve stimulus to a cause outside of us is already the result

of a false and unjustifiable application of the principle of sufficient reason. If

truth alone had been the deciding factor in the genesis of language, and if the

standpoint of certainty had been decisive for designations, then how could we

still dare to say "the stone is hard," as if "hard" were something otherwise

familiar to us, and not merely a totally subjective stimulation! We separate

things according to gender, designating the tree as masculine and the plant as

feminine. What arbitrary assignments! How far this oversteps the canons of

certainty!  We  speak  of  a  "snake":  this  designation  touches  only  upon  its

ability  to  twist  itself  and  could  therefore  also  fit  a  worm.  What  arbitrary

differentiations!  What  one-sided  preferences,  first  for  this,  then  for  that

property of a thing! The various languages placed side by side show that with

words it is never a question of truth, never a question of adequate expression;

otherwise, there would not be so many languages. The "thing in itself" (which

is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would

be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language

and something not in the least worth striving for. This creator only designates

the relations of things to men, and for expressing these relations he lays hold

of the boldest metaphors. To begin with, a nerve stimulus is transferred into

an image: first metaphor. The image, in turn, is imitated in a sound: second

metaphor. And each time there is a complete overleaping of one sphere, right

into the middle of an entirely new and different one. One can imagine a man

who  is  totally  deaf  and  has  never  had  a  sensation  of  sound  and  music.Perhaps such a person will gaze with astonishment at Chladni's sound figures;

perhaps he will discover their causes in the vibrations of the string and will

now swear that he must know what men mean by "sound." It is this way with

all of us concerning language; we believe that we know something about the

things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet

we possess nothing but metaphors for things-metaphors which correspond in

no way to the original entities. In the same way that the sound appears as a

sand figure, so the mysterious X of the thing in itself first appears as a nerve

stimulus,  then  as  an  image,  and  finally  as  a  sound.  Thus  the  genesis  of

language does not proceed logically in any case, and all the material within

and with which the man of truth, the scientist, and the philosopher later work

and build, if not derived from never-never land, is a least not derived from

the essence of things.

  In  particular,  let  us  further  consider  the  formation  of  concepts.  Every

word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to

serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience

to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it

simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases-which means,

purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal.

Every concept arises from the equation of unequal things. Just as it is certain

that one leaf is never totally the same as another, so it is certain that the

concept "leaf" is formed by arbitrarily discarding these individual differences

and by forgetting the distinguishing aspects. This awakens the idea that, in

addition to the leaves, there exists in nature the "leaf": the original model

according to which all the leaves were perhaps woven, sketched, measured,

colored, curled, and painted-but by incompetent hands, so that no specimen

has  turned  out  to  be  a  correct,  trustworthy,  and  faithful  likeness  of  the

original model. We call a person "honest," and then we ask "why has he

behaved  so  honestly  today?"  Our  usual  answer  is,  "on  account  of  his

honesty." Honesty! This in turn means that the leaf is the cause of the leaves.

We know nothing whatsoever about an essential quality called "honesty"; but

we do know of countless individualized and consequently unequal actions

which we equate by omitting the aspects in which they are unequal and which

we now designate as "honest" actions. Finally we formulate from them a

qualities occulta which has the name "honesty." We obtain the concept, as we

do the form, by overlooking what is individual and actual; whereas nature is

acquainted with no forms and no concepts, and likewise with no species, butonly with an X which remains inaccessible and undefinable for us. For even

our contrast between individual and species is something anthropomorphic

and  does  not  originate  in  the  essence  of  things;  although  we  should  not

presume to claim that this contrast does not correspond to the essence of

things: that would of course be a dogmatic assertion and, as such, would be

just as indemonstrable as its opposite.

  What  then  is  truth?  A  movable  host  of  metaphors,  metonymies,  and;

anthropomorphisms:  in  short,  a  sum  of  human  relations  which  have  been

poetically  and  rhetorically  intensified,  transferred,  and  embellished,  and

which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding.

Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions- they are metaphors

that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins

which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no

longer as coins.

  We still do not yet know where the drive for truth comes from. For so far

we have heard only of the duty which society imposes in order to exist: to be

truthful means to employ the usual metaphors. Thus, to express it morally,

this is the duty to lie according to a fixed convention, to lie with the herd and

in a manner binding upon everyone. Now man of course forgets that this is

the  way  things  stand  for  him.  Thus  he  lies  in  the  manner  indicated,

unconsciously and in accordance with habits which are centuries' old; and

precisely by means of this unconsciousness and forgetfulness he arrives at his

sense of truth. From the sense that one is obliged to designate one thing as

"red," another as "cold," and a third as "mute," there arises a moral impulse in

regard to truth. The venerability, reliability, and utility of truth is something

which  a  person  demonstrates  for  himself  from  the  contrast  with  the  liar,

whom no one trusts and everyone excludes. As a "rational" being, he now

places  his  behavior  under  the  contol  of  abstractions.  He  will  no  longer

tolerate being carried away by sudden impressions, by intuitions. First he

universalizes all these impressions into less colorful, cooler concepts, so that

he can entrust the guidance of his life and conduct to them. Everything which

distinguishes man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize

perceptual  metaphors  in  a  schema,  and  thus  to  dissolve  an  image  into  a

concept.  For  something  is  possible  in  the  realm  of  these  schemata  which

could never be achieved with the vivid first impressions: the construction of a

pyramidal order according to castes and degrees, the creation of a new world

of  laws,  privileges,  subordinations,  and  clearly  marked  boundaries-a  newworld, one which now confronts that other vivid world of first impressions as

more  solid,  more  universal,  better  known,  and  more  human  than  the

immediately  perceived  world,  and  thus  as  the  regulative  and  imperative

world. Whereas each perceptual metaphor is individual and without equals

and is therefore able to elude all classification, the great edifice of concepts

displays the rigid regularity of a Roman columbarium and exhales in logic

that strength and coolness which is characteristic of mathematics. Anyone

who  has  felt  this  cool  breath  [of  logic]  will  hardly  believe  that  even  the

concept-which  is  as  bony,  foursquare,  and  transposable  as  a  die-is

nevertheless merely the residue of a metaphor, and that the illusion which is

involved in the artistic transference of a nerve stimulus into images is, if not

the  mother,  then  the  grandmother  of  every  single  concept.  But  in  this

conceptual  crap  game  "truth"  means  using  every  die  in  the  designated

manner, counting its spots accurately, fashioning the right categories, and

never violating the order of caste and class rank. Just as the Romans and

Etruscans cut up the heavens with rigid mathematical lines and confined a

god within each of the spaces thereby delimited, as within a templum, so

every people has a similarly mathematically divided conceptual heaven above

themselves and henceforth thinks that truth demands that each conceptual

god be sought only within his own sphere. Here one may certainly admire

man as a mighty genius of construction, who succeeds in piling an infinitely

complicated dome of concepts upon an unstable foundation, and, as it were,

on running water. Of course, in order to be supported by such a foundation,

his  construction  must  be  like  one  constructed  of  spiders'  webs:  delicate

enough to be carried along by the waves, strong enough not to be blown apart

by every wind. As a genius of construction man raises himself far above the

bee in the following way: whereas the bee builds with wax that he gathers

from nature, man builds with the far more delicate conceptual material which

he first has to manufacture from himself. In this he is greatly to be admired,

but not on account of his drive for truth or for pure knowledge of things.

When someone hides something behind a bush and looks for it again in the

same place and finds it there as well, there is not much to praise in such

seeking and finding. Yet this is how matters stand regarding seeking and

finding "truth" within the realm of reason. If I make up the definition of a

mammal, and then, after inspecting a camel, declare "look, a mammal' I have

indeed brought a truth to light in this way, but it is a truth of limited value.

That is to say, it is a thoroughly anthropomorphic truth which contains not asingle point which would be "true in itself" or really and universally valid

apart from man. At bottom, what the investigator of such truths is seeking is

only the metamorphosis of the world into man. He strives to understand the

world  as  something  analogous  to  man,  and  at  best  he  achieves  by  his

struggles the feeling of assimilation. Similar to the way in which astrologers

considered the stars to be in man's service and connected with his happiness

and sorrow, such an investigator considers the entire universe in connection

with man: the entire universe as the infinitely fractured echo of one original

sound-man;  the  entire  universe  as  the  infinitely  multiplied  copy  of  one

original picture-man. His method is to treat man as the measure of all things,

but in doing so he again proceeds from the error of believing that he hasthese

things  [which  he  intends  to  measure]  immediately  before  him  as  mere

objects. He forgets that the original perceptual metaphors are metaphors and

takes them to be the things themselves.

  Only by forgetting this primitive world of metaphor can one live with any

repose,  security,  and  consistency:  only  by  means  of  the  petrification  and

coagulation of a mass of images which originally streamed from the primal

faculty of human imagination like a fiery liquid, only in the invincible faith

that this sun, this window, this table is a truth in itself, in short, only by

forgetting that he himself is an artistically creating subject, does man live

with  any  repose,  security,  and  consistency.  If  but  for  an  instant  he  could

escape from the prison walls of this faith, his"self consciousness" would be

immediately destroyed. It is even a difficult thing for him to admit to himself

that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different world from the one

that man does, and that the question of which of these perceptions of the

world is the more correct one is quite meaningless, for this would have to

have been decided previously in accordance with the criterion of the correct

perception,  which  means,  in  accordance  with  a  criterion  which  is  not

available. But in any case it seems to me that "the correct perception"-which

would  mean  "the  adequate  expression  of  an  object  in  the  subject"-is  a

contradictory impossibility. For between two absolutely different spheres, as

between  subject  and  object,  there  is  no  causality,  no  correctness,  and  no

expression;  there  is,  at  most,  an  aesthetic  relation:  I  mean,  a  suggestive

transference, a stammering translation into a completely foreign tongue-for

which I there is required, in any case, a freely inventive intermediate sphere

and mediating force. "Appearance" is a word that contains many temptations,

which is why I avoid it as much as possible. For it is not true that the essenceof  things  "appears"  in  the  empirical  world.  A  painter  without  hands  who

wished to express in song the picture before his mind would, by means of this

substitution of spheres, still reveal more about the essence of things than does

the  empirical  world.  Even  the  relationship  of  a  nerve  stimulus  to  the

generated image is not a necessary one. But when the same image has been

generated millions of times and has been handed down for many generations

and finally appears on the same occasion every time for all mankind, then it

acquires at last the same meaning for men it would have if it were the sole

necessary image and if the relationship of the original nerve stimulus to the

generated image were a strictly causal one. In the same manner, an eternally

repeated  dream  would  certainly  be  felt  and  judged  to  be  reality.  But  the

hardening  and  congealing  of  a  metaphor  guarantees  absolutely  nothing

concerning its necessity and exclusive justification.

  Every person who is familiar with such considerations has no doubt felt a

deep mistrust of all idealism of this sort: just as often as he has quite early

convinced himself of the eternal consistency, omnipresence, and fallibility of

the laws of nature. He has concluded that so far as we can penetrate here-

from the telescopic heights to the microscopic depths-everything is secure,

complete, infinite, regular, and without any gaps. Science will be able to dig

successfully  in  this  shaft  forever,  and  the  things  that  are  discovered  will

harmonize with and not contradict each other. How little does this resemble a

product of the imagination, for if it were such, there should be some place

where the illusion and reality can be divined. Against this, the following must

be said: if each us had a different kind of sense perception-if we could only

perceive things now as a bird, now as a worm, now as a plant, or if one of us

saw a stimulus as red, another as blue, while a third even heard the same

stimulus as a sound-then no one would speak of such a regularity of nature,

rather, nature would be grasped only as a creation which is subjective in the

highest degree. After all, what is a law of nature as such for us? We are not

acquainted  with  it  in  itself,  but  only  with  its  effects,  which  means  in  its

relation to other laws of nature-which, in turn, are known to us only as sums

of relations. Therefore all these relations always refer again to others and are

thoroughly incomprehensible to us in their essence. All that we actually know

about these laws of nature is what we ourselves bring to them-time and space,

and  therefore  relationships  of  succession  and  number.  But  everything

marvelous  about  the  laws  of  nature,  everything  that  quite  astonishes  us

therein and seems to demand explanation, everything that might lead us todistrust  idealism:  all  this  is  completely  and  solely  contained  within  the

mathematical strictness and inviolability of our representations of time and

space. But we produce these representations in and from ourselves with the

same necessity with which the spider spins. If we are forced to comprehend

all things only under these forms, then it ceases to be amazing that in all

things we actually comprehend nothing but these forms. For they must all

bear within themselves the laws of number, and it is precisely number which

is most astonishing in things. All that conformity to law, which impresses us

so much in the movement of the stars and in chemical processes, coincides at

bottom with those properties which we bring to things. Thus it is we who

impress ourselves in this way. In conjunction with this, it of course follows

that the artistic process of metaphor formation with which every sensation

begins in us already presupposes these forms and thus occurs within them.

The only way in which the possibility of subsequently constructing a new

conceptual edifice from metaphors themselves can be explained is by the firm

persistence of these original forms That is to say, this conceptual edifice is an

imitation of temporal, spatial, and numerical relationships in the domain of

metaphor.

  We  have  seen  how  it  is  originally  language  which  works  on  the

construction of concepts, a labor taken over in later ages by science. Just as

the bee simultaneously constructs cells and fills them with honey, so science

works unceasingly on this great columbarium of concepts, the graveyard of

perceptions.  It  is  always  building  new,  higher  stories  and  shoring  up,

cleaning, and renovating the old cells; above all, it takes pains to fill up this

monstrously towering framework and to arrange therein the entire empirical

world,  which  is  to  say,  the  anthropomorphic  world.  Whereas  the  man  of

action binds his life to reason and its concepts so that he will not be swept

away and lost, the scientific investigator builds his hut right next to the tower

of science so that he will be able to work on it and to find shelter for himself

beneath those bulwarks which presently exist. And he requires shelter, for

there are frightful powers which continuously break in upon him, powers

which oppose scientific "truth" with completely different kinds of "truths"

which bear on their shields the most varied sorts of emblems.

  The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human

drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one

would thereby dispense with man himself. This drive is not truly vanquished

and  scarcely  subdued  by  the  fact  that  a  regular  and  rigid  new  world  isconstructed as its prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts. It

seeks a new realm and another channel for its activity, and it finds this in

myth and in art generally. This drive continually confuses the conceptual

categories and cells by bringing forward new transferences, metaphors, and

metonymies. It continually manifests an ardent desire to refashion the world

which presents itself to waking man, so that it will be as colorful, irregular,

lacking in results and coherence, charming, and eternally new as the world of

dreams. Indeed, it is only by means of the rigid and regular web of concepts

that the waking man clearly sees that he is awake; and it is precisely because

of this that he sometimes thinks that he must be dreaming when this web of

concepts is torn by art. Pascal is right in maintaining that if the same dream

came to us every night we would be just as occupied with it as we are with

the things that we see every day. "If a workman were sure to dream for

twelve straight hours every night that he was king," said Pascal, "I believe

that he would be just as happy as a king who dreamt for twelve hours every

night that he was a workman. In fact, because of the way that myth takes it

for  granted  that  miracles  are  always  happening,  the  waking  life  of  a

mythically  inspired  people-the  ancient  Greeks,  for  instance-  more  closely

resembles  a  dream  than  it  does  the  waking  world  of  a  scientifically

disenchanted thinker. When every tree can suddenly speak as a nymph, when

a god in the shape of a bull can drag away maidens, when even the goddess

Athena  herself  is  suddenly  seen  in  the  company  of  Peisastratus  driving

through the market place of Athens with a beautiful team of horses-and this is

what the honest Athenian believed- then, as in a dream, anything is possible

at each moment, and all of nature swarms around man as if it were nothing

but  a  masquerade  of  the  gods,  who  were  merely  amusing  themselves  by

deceiving men in all these shapes.

  But man has an invincible inclination to allow himself to be deceived D

and is, as it were, enchanted with happiness when the rhapsodist tells i him

epic fables as if they were true, or when the actor in the theater acts more

royally than any real king. So long as it is able to deceive without injuring,

that master of deception, the intellect, is free; it is released from its former

slavery  and  celebrates  its  Saturnalia.  It  is  never  more  luxuriant,  richer,

prouder,  more  clever  and  more  daring.  With  creative  pleasure  it  throws

metaphors into confusion and displaces the boundary stones of abstractions,

so  that,  for  example,  it  designates  the  stream  as  "the  moving  path  which

carries man where he would otherwise walk." The intellect has now thrownthe token of bondage from itself. At other times it endeavors, with gloomy

officiousness,  to  show  the  way  and  to  demonstrate  the  tools  to  a  poor

individual who covets existence; it is like a servant who goes in search of

booty and prey for his master. But now it has become the master and it dares

to wipe from its face the expression of indigence. In comparison with its

previous  conduct,  everything  that  it  now  does  bears  the  mark  of

dissimulation,  just  as  that  previous  conduct  did  of  distortion.  The  free

intellect copies human life, but it considers this life to be something good and

seems to be quite satisfied with it. That immense framework and planking of

concepts  to  which  the  needy  man  clings  his  whole  life  long  in  order  to

preserve himself is nothing but a scaffolding and toy for the most audacious

feats of the liberated intellect. And when it smashes this framework to pieces,

throws it into confusion, and puts it back together in an ironic fashion, pairing

the most alien things and separating the closest, it is demonstrating that it has

no need of these makeshifts of indigence and that it will now be guided by

intuitions rather than by concepts. There is no regular path which leads from

these intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions.

There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows

dumb,  or  else  he  speaks  only  in  forbidden  metaphors  and  in  unheard-of

combinations of concepts. He does this so that by shattering and mocking the

old  conceptual  barriers  he  may  at  least  correspond  creatively  to  the

impression of the powerful present intuition.

  There are ages in which the rational man and the intuitive man stand side

by side, the one in fear of intuition, the other with scorn for abstraction. The

latter is just as irrational as the former is inartistic. They both desire to rule

over life: the former, by knowing how to meet his principle needs by means

of foresight, prudence, and regularity; the latter, by disregarding these needs

and, as an "overjoyed hero," counting as real only that life which has been

disguised  as  illusion  and  beauty.  Whenever,  as  was  perhaps  the  case  in

ancient Greece, the intuitive man handles his weapons more authoritatively

and victoriously than his opponent, then, under favorable circumstances, a

culture can take shape and art's mastery over life can be established. All the

manifestations of such a life will be accompanied by this dissimulation, this

disavowal of indigence, this glitter of metaphorical intuitions, and, in general,

this immediacy of deception: neither the house, nor the gait, nor the clothes,

nor the clay jugs give evidence of having been invented because of a pressing

need. It seems as if they were all intended to express an exalted happiness, anOIympian cloudlessness, and, as it were, a playing with seriousness. The man

who is guided by concepts and abstractions only succeeds by such means in

warding off misfortune, without ever gaining any happiness for himself from

these abstractions. And while he aims for the greatest possible freedom from

pain, the intuitive man, standing in the midst of a culture, already reaps from

his  intuition  a  harvest  of  continually  inflowing  illumination,  cheer,  and

redemption-in addition to obtaining a defense against misfortune. To be sure,

he suffers more intensely, when he suffers; he even suffers more frequently,

since he does not understand how to learn from experience and keeps falling

over and over again into the same ditch. He is then just as irrational in sorrow

as he is in happiness: he cries aloud and will not be consoled. How differently

the stoical man who learns from experience and governs himself by concepts

is affected by the same misfortunes! This man, who at other times seeks

nothing but sincerity, truth, freedom from deception, and protection against

ensnaring  surprise  attacks,  now  executes  a  masterpiece  of  deception:  he

executes his masterpiece of deception in misfortune, as the other type of man

executes his in times of happiness. He wears no quivering and changeable

human face, but, as it were, a mask with dignified, symmetrical features. He

does  not  cry;  he  does  not  even  alter  his  voice.  When  a  real  storm  cloud

thunders above him, he wraps himself in his cloak, and with slow steps he

walks from beneath it.



    HOMER AND CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY - INAUGURAL ADDRESS

                      DELIVERED AT BALE UNIVERSITY

                            TRANSLATED BY J.M. Kennedy

  28th of May 1869.

  At  the  present  day  no  clear  and  consistent  opinion  seems  to  be  held

regarding Classical Philology. We are conscious of this in the circles of the

learned just as much as among the followers of that science itself. The cause

of this lies in its many-sided character, in the lack of an abstract unity, and in

the  inorganic  aggregation  of  heterogeneous  scientific  activities  which  are

connected with one another only by the name "Philology." It must be freely

admitted  that  philology  is  to  some  extent  borrowed  from  several  other

sciences, and is mixed together like a magic potion from the most outlandish

liquors, ores, and bones. It may even be added that it likewise conceals within

itself an artistic element, one which, on aesthetic and ethical grounds, may becalled imperatival--an element that acts in opposition to its purely scientific

behaviour.  Philology  is  composed  of  history  just  as  much  as  of  natural

science or aesthetics: history, in so far as it endeavours to comprehend the

manifestations of the individualities of peoples in ever new images, and the

prevailing law in the disappearance of phenomena; natural science, in so far

as it strives to fathom the deepest instinct of man, that of speech; aesthetics,

finally, because from various antiquities at our disposal it endeavours to pick

out  the  so-called  "classical"  antiquity,  with  the  view  and  pretension  of

excavating the ideal world buried under it, and to hold up to the present the

mirror of the classical and everlasting standards. That these wholly different

scientific  and  aesthetico-ethical  impulses  have  been  associated  under  a

common name, a kind of sham monarchy, is shown especially by the fact that

philology  at  every  period  from  its  origin  onwards  was  at  the  same  time

pedagogical. From the standpoint of the pedagogue, a choice was offered of

those elements which were of the greatest educational value; and thus that

science, or at least that scientific aim, which we call philology, gradually

developed out of the practical calling originated by the exigencies of that

science itself.

  These philological aims were pursued sometimes with greater ardour and

sometimes  with  less,  in  accordance  with  the  degree  of  culture  and  the

development of the taste of a particular period; but, on the other hand, the

followers  of  this  science  are  in  the  habit  of  regarding  the  aims  which

correspond to their several abilities as the aims of philology; whence it comes

about that the estimation of philology in public opinion depends upon the

weight of the personalities of the philologists!

  At  the  present  time--that  is  to  say,  in  a  period  which  has  seen  men

distinguished in almost every department of philology--a general uncertainty

of judgment has increased more and more, and likewise a general relaxation

of interest and participation in philological problems. Such an undecided and

imperfect state of public opinion is damaging to a science in that its hidden

and  open  enemies  can  work  with  much  better  prospects  of  success.  And

philology has a great many such enemies. Where do we not meet with them,

these mockers, always ready to aim a blow at the philological "moles," the

animals that practise dust-eating ex professo, and that grub up and eat for the

eleventh time what they have already eaten ten times before. For opponents

of this sort, however, philology is merely a useless, harmless, and inoffensive

pastime, an object of laughter and not of hate. But, on the other hand, there isa boundless and infuriated hatred of philology wherever an ideal, as such, is

feared, where the modern man falls down to worship himself, and where

Hellenism is looked upon as a superseded and hence very insignificant point

of view. Against these enemies, we philologists must always count upon the

assistance of artists and men of artistic minds; for they alone can judge how

the sword of barbarism sweeps over the head of every one who loses sight of

the  unutterable  simplicity  and  noble  dignity  of  the  Hellene;  and  how  no

progress in commerce or technical industries, however brilliant, no school

regulations, no political education of the masses, however widespread and

complete, can protect us from the curse of ridiculous and barbaric offences

against good taste, or from annihilation by the Gorgon head of the classicist.

  Whilst philology as a whole is looked on with jealous eyes by these two

classes  of  opponents,  there  are  numerous  and  varied  hostilities  in  other

directions  of  philology;  philologists  themselves  are  quarrelling  with  one

another; internal dissensions are caused by useless disputes about precedence

and  mutual  jealousies,  but  especially  by  the  differences--even  enmities--

comprised in the name of philology, which are not, however, by any means

naturally harmonised instincts.

  Science has this in common with art, that the most ordinary, everyday

thing  appears  to  it  as  something  entirely  new  and  attractive,  as  if

metamorphosed by witchcraft and now seen for the first time. Life is worth

living, says art, the beautiful temptress; life is worth knowing, says science.

With this contrast the so heartrending and dogmatic tradition follows in a

theory, and consequently in the practice of classical philology derived from

this theory. We may consider antiquity from a scientific point of view; we

may  try  to  look  at  what  has  happened  with  the  eye  of  a  historian,  or  to

arrange and compare the linguistic forms of ancient masterpieces, to bring

them  at  all  events  under  a  morphological  law;  but  we  always  lose  the

wonderful creative force, the real fragrance, of the atmosphere of antiquity;

we forget that passionate emotion which instinctively drove our meditation

and enjoyment back to the Greeks. From this point onwards we must take

notice  of  a  clearly  determined  and  very  surprising  antagonism  which

philology has great cause to regret. From the circles upon whose help we

must place the most implicit reliance--the artistic friends of antiquity, the

warm  supporters  of  Hellenic  beauty  and  noble  simplicity--we  hear  harsh

voices crying out that it is precisely the philologists themselves who are the

real opponents and destroyers of the ideals of antiquity. Schiller upbraidedthe philologists with having scattered Homer's laurel crown to the winds. It

was none other than Goethe who, in early life a supporter of Wolf's theories

regarding Homer, recanted in the verses--

  With subtle wit you took away Our former adoration: The Iliad, you may

us say, Was mere conglomeration. Think it not crime in any way: Youth's

fervent adoration Leads us to know the verity, And feel the poet's unity.

  The reason of this want of piety and reverence must lie deeper; and many

are in doubt as to whether philologists are lacking in artistic capacity and

impressions, so that they are unable to do justice to the ideal, or whether the

spirit  of  negation  has  become  a  destructive  and  iconoclastic  principle  of

theirs.  When,  however,  even  the  friends  of  antiquity,  possessed  of  such

doubts and hesitations, point to our present classical philology as something

questionable,  what  influence  may  we  not  ascribe  to  the  outbursts  of  the

"realists" and the claptrap of the heroes of the passing hour? To answer the

latter on this occasion, especially when we consider the nature of the present

assembly, would be highly injudicious; at any rate, if I do not wish to meet

with the fate of that sophist who, when in Sparta, publicly undertook to praise

and defend Herakles, when he was interrupted with the query: "But who then

has found fault with him?" I cannot help thinking, however, that some of

these scruples are still sounding in the ears of not a few in this gathering; for

they may still be frequently heard from the lips of noble and artistically gifted

men--as  even  an  upright  philologist  must  feel  them,  and  feel  them  most

painfully, at moments when his spirits are downcast. For the single individual

there is no deliverance from the dissensions referred to; but what we contend

and inscribe on our banner is the fact that classical philology, as a whole, has

nothing whatsoever to do with the quarrels and bickerings of its individual

disciples. The entire scientific and artistic movement of this peculiar centaur

is bent, though with cyclopic slowness, upon bridging over the gulf between

the ideal antiquity--which is perhaps only the magnificent blossoming of the

Teutonic  longing  for  the  south--and  the  real  antiquity;  and  thus  classical

philology pursues only the final end of its own being, which is the fusing

together of primarily hostile impulses that have only forcibly been brought

together. Let us talk as we will about the unattainability of this goal, and even

designate the goal itself as an illogical pretension--the aspiration for it is very

real; and I should like to try to make it clear by an example that the most

significant  steps  of  classical  philology  never  lead  away  from  the  ideal

antiquity, but to it; and that, just when people are speaking unwarrantably ofthe  overthrow  of  sacred  shrines,  new  and  more  worthy  altars  are  being

erected.  Let  us  then  examine  the  so-called  Homeric  question  from  this

standpoint, a question the most important problem of which Schiller called a

scholastic barbarism.

  The important problem referred to is the question of the personality of

Homer.

  We  now  meet  everywhere  with  the  firm  opinion  that  the  question  of

Homer's personality is no longer timely, and that it is quite a different thing

from the real "Homeric question." It may be added that, for a given period--

such as our present philological period, for example--the centre of discussion

may be removed from the problem of the poet's personality; for even now a

painstaking  experiment  is  being  made  to  reconstruct  the  Homeric  poems

without the aid of personality, treating them as the work of several different

persons. But if the centre of a scientific question is rightly seen to be where

the swelling tide of new views has risen up, i.e. where individual scientific

investigation comes into contact with the whole life of science and culture--if

any one, in other words, indicates a historico-cultural valuation as the central

point of the question, he must also, in the province of Homeric criticism, take

his stand upon the question of personality as being the really fruitful oasis in

the desert of the whole argument. For in Homer the modern world, I will not

say has learnt, but has examined, a great historical point of view; and, even

without now putting forward my own opinion as to whether this examination

has been or can be happily carried out, it was at all events the first example of

the  application  of  that  productive  point  of  view.  By  it  scholars  learnt  to

recognise condensed beliefs in the apparently firm, immobile figures of the

life of ancient peoples; by it they for the first time perceived the wonderful

capability of the soul of a people to represent the conditions of its morals and

beliefs in the form of a personality. When historical criticism has confidently

seized upon this method of evaporating apparently concrete personalities, it is

permissible  to  point  to  the  first  experiment  as  an  important  event  in  the

history  of  sciences,  without  considering  whether  it  was  successful  in  this

instance or not.

  It is a common occurrence for a series of striking signs and wonderful

emotions to precede an epoch-making discovery. Even the experiment I have

just  referred  to  has  its  own  attractive  history;  but  it  goes  back  to  a

surprisingly ancient era. Friedrich August Wolf has exactly indicated the spot

where  Greek  antiquity  dropped  the  question.  The  zenith  of  the  historico-literary  studies  of  the  Greeks,  and  hence  also  of  their  point  of  greatest

importance--the  Homeric  question--was  reached  in  the  age  of  the

Alexandrian  grammarians.  Up  to  this  time  the  Homeric  question  had  run

through the long chain of a uniform process of development, of which the

standpoint of those grammarians seemed to be the last link, the last, indeed,

which was attainable by antiquity. They conceived the Iliad and the Odyssey

as the creations of one single Homer; they declared it to be psychologically

possible for two such different works to have sprung from the brain of one

genius, in contradiction to the Chorizontes, who represented the extreme limit

of  the  scepticism  of  a  few  detached  individuals  of  antiquity  rather  than

antiquity  itself  considered  as  a  whole.  To  explain  the  different  general

impression of the two books on the assumption that one poet composed them

both, scholars sought assistance by referring to the seasons of the poet's life,

and compared the poet of the Odyssey to the setting sun. The eyes of those

critics were tirelessly on the lookout for discrepancies in the language and

thoughts of the two poems; but at this time also a history of the Homeric

poem and its tradition was prepared, according to which these discrepancies

were not due to Homer, but to those who committed his words to writing and

those who sang them. It was believed that Homer's poem was passed from

one  generation  to  another  viva  voce,  and  faults  were  attributed  to  the

improvising and at times forgetful bards. At a certain given date, about the

time of Pisistratus, the poems which had been repeated orally were said to

have been collected in manuscript form; but the scribes, it is added, allowed

themselves to take some liberties with the text by transposing some lines and

adding extraneous matter here and there. This entire hypothesis is the most

important in the domain of literary studies that antiquity has exhibited; and

the acknowledgment of the dissemination of the Homeric poems by word of

mouth, as opposed to the habits of a book-learned age, shows in particular a

depth of ancient sagacity worthy of our admiration. From those times until

the generation that produced Friedrich August Wolf we must take a jump

over a long historical vacuum; but in our own age we find the argument left

just  as  it  was  at  the  time  when  the  power  of  controversy  departed  from

antiquity, and it is a matter of indifference to us that Wolf accepted as certain

tradition  what  antiquity  itself  had  set  up  only  as  a  hypothesis.  It  may  be

remarked as most characteristic of this hypothesis that, in the strictest sense,

the personality of Homer is treated seriously; that a certain standard of inner

harmony is everywhere presupposed in the manifestations of the personality;and that, with these two excellent auxiliary hypotheses, whatever is seen to

be below this standard and opposed to this inner harmony is at once swept

aside as un-Homeric. But even this distinguishing characteristic, in place of

wishing  to  recognise  the  supernatural  existence  of  a  tangible  personality,

ascends likewise through all the stages that lead to that zenith, with ever-

increasing energy and clearness. Individuality is ever more strongly felt and

accentuated; the psychological possibility of a single Homer is ever more

forcibly demanded. If we descend backwards from this zenith, step by step,

we find a guide to the understanding of the Homeric problem in the person of

Aristotle. Homer was for him the flawless and untiring artist who knew his

end and the means to attain it; but there is still a trace of infantile criticism to

be found in Aristotle--i.e., in the naive concession he made to the public

opinion  that  considered  Homer  as  the  author  of  the  original  of  all  comic

epics,  the  Margites.  If  we  go  still  further  backwards  from  Aristotle,  the

inability to create a personality is seen to increase; more and more poems are

attributed to Homer; and every period lets us see its degree of criticism by

how much and what it considers as Homeric. In this backward examination,

we instinctively feel that away beyond Herodotus there lies a period in which

an immense flood of great epics has been identified with the name of Homer.

  Let us imagine ourselves as living in the time of Pisistratus: the word

"Homer"  then  comprehended  an  abundance  of  dissimilarities.  What  was

meant by "Homer" at that time? It is evident that that generation found itself

unable to grasp a personality and the limits of its manifestations. Homer had

now  become  of  small  consequence.  And  then  we  meet  with  the  weighty

question: What lies before this period? Has Homer's personality, because it

cannot be grasped, gradually faded away into an empty name? Or had all the

Homeric  poems  been  gathered  together  in  a  body,  the  nation  naively

representing itself by the figure of Homer? Was the person created out of a

conception, or the conception out of a person? This is the real "Homeric

question," the central problem of the personality.

  The difficulty of answering this question, however, is increased when we

seek  a  reply  in  another  direction,  from  the  standpoint  of  the  poems

themselves  which  have  come  down  to  us.  As  it  is  difficult  for  us  at  the

present day, and necessitates a serious effort on our part, to understand the

law  of  gravitation  clearly--that  the  earth  alters  its  form  of  motion  when

another heavenly body changes its position in space, although no material

connection unites one to the other--it likewise costs us some trouble to obtaina clear impression of that wonderful problem which, like a coin long passed

from  hand  to  hand,  has  lost  its  original  and  highly  conspicuous  stamp.

Poetical works, which cause the hearts of even the greatest geniuses to fail

when they endeavour to vie with them, and in which unsurpassable images

are held up for the admiration of posterity--and yet the poet who wrote them

with only a hollow, shaky name, whenever we do lay hold on him; nowhere

the solid kernel of a powerful personality. "For who would wage war with the

gods: who, even with the one god?" asks Goethe even, who, though a genius,

strove  in  vain  to  solve  that  mysterious  problem  of  the  Homeric

inaccessibility.

  The conception of popular poetry seemed to lead like a bridge over this

problem--a deeper and more original power than that of every single creative

individual  was  said  to  have  become  active;  the  happiest  people,  in  the

happiest  period  of  its  existence,  in  the  highest  activity  of  fantasy  and

formative power, was said to have created those immeasurable poems. In this

universality there is something almost intoxicating in the thought of a popular

poem: we feel, with artistic pleasure, the broad, overpowering liberation of a

popular  gift,  and  we  delight  in  this  natural  phenomenon  as  we  do  in  an

uncontrollable  cataract.  But  as  soon  as  we  examine  this  thought  at  close

quarters, we involuntarily put a poetic mass of people in the place of the

poetising  soul  of  the  people:  a  long  row  of  popular  poets  in  whom

individuality has no meaning, and in whom the tumultuous movement of a

people's  soul,  the  intuitive  strength  of  a  people's  eye,  and  the  unabated

profusion  of  a  people's  fantasy,  were  once  powerful:  a  row  of  original

geniuses, attached to a time, to a poetic genus, to a subject-matter.

  Such a conception justly made people suspicious. Could it be possible

that  that  same  Nature  who  so  sparingly  distributed  her  rarest  and  most

precious production--genius--should suddenly take the notion of lavishing her

gifts  in  one  sole  direction?  And  here  the  thorny  question  again  made  its

appearance: Could we not get along with one genius only, and explain the

present existence of that unattainable excellence? And now eyes were keenly

on the lookout for whatever that excellence and singularity might consist of.

Impossible for it to be in the construction of the complete works, said one

party, for this is far from faultless; but doubtless to be found in single songs:

in the single pieces above all; not in the whole. A second party, on the other

hand, sheltered themselves beneath the authority of Aristotle, who especially

admired Homer's "divine" nature in the choice of his entire subject, and themanner in which he planned and carried it out. If, however, this construction

was not clearly seen, this fault was due to the way the poems were handed

down to posterity and not to the poet himself--it was the result of retouchings

and interpolations, owing to which the original setting of the work gradually

became  obscured.  The  more  the  first  school  looked  for  inequalities,

contradictions, perplexities, the more energetically did the other school brush

aside what in their opinion obscured the original plan, in order, if possible,

that nothing might be left remaining but the actual words of the original epic

itself. The second school of thought of course held fast by the conception of

an epoch-making genius as the composer of the great works. The first school,

on the other hand, wavered between the supposition of one genius plus a

number  of  minor  poets,  and  another  hypothesis  which  assumed  only  a

number of superior and even mediocre individual bards, but also postulated a

mysterious discharging, a deep, national, artistic impulse, which shows itself

in individual minstrels as an almost indifferent medium. It is to this latter

school that we must attribute the representation of the Homeric poems as the

expression of that mysterious impulse.

  All these schools of thought start from the assumption that the problem of

the  present  form  of  these  epics  can  be  solved  from  the  standpoint  of  an

aesthetic judgment--but we must await the decision as to the authorised line

of  demarcation  between  the  man  of  genius  and  the  poetical  soul  of  the

people. Are there characteristic differences between the utterances of the man

of genius and the poetical soul of the people?

  This whole contrast, however, is unjust and misleading. There is no more

dangerous assumption in modern aesthetics than that of popular poetry and

individual  poetry,  or,  as  it  is  usually  called,  artistic  poetry.  This  is  the

reaction,  or,  if  you  will,  the  superstition,  which  followed  upon  the  most

momentous  discovery  of  historico-philological  science,  the  discovery  and

appreciation of the soul of the people. For this discovery prepared the way for

a  coming  scientific  view  of  history,  which  was  until  then,  and  in  many

respects is even now, a mere collection of materials, with the prospect that

new materials would continue to be added, and that the huge, overflowing

pile would never be systematically arranged. The people now understood for

the first time that the long-felt power of greater individualities and wills was

larger than the pitifully small will of an individual man;[1] they now saw that

everything truly great in the kingdom of the will could not have its deepest

root in the inefficacious and ephemeral individual will; and, finally, they nowdiscovered  the  powerful  instincts  of  the  masses,  and  diagnosed  those

unconscious impulses to be the foundations and supports of the so-called

universal history. But the newly-lighted flame also cast its shadow: and this

shadow  was  none  other  than  that  superstition  already  referred  to,  which

popular poetry set up in opposition to individual poetry, and thus enlarged the

comprehension  of  the  people's  soul  to  that  of  the  people's  mind.  By  the

misapplication of a tempting analogical inference, people had reached the

point of applying in the domain of the intellect and artistic ideas that principle

of greater individuality which is truly applicable only in the domain of the

will. The masses have never experienced more flattering treatment than in

thus having the laurel of genius set upon their empty heads. It was imagined

that new shells were forming round a small kernel, so to speak, and that those

pieces of popular poetry originated like avalanches, in the drift and flow of

tradition. They were, however, ready to consider that kernel as being of the

smallest possible dimensions, so that they might occasionally get rid of it

altogether without losing anything of the mass of the avalanche. According to

this view, the text itself and the stories built round it are one and the same

thing.

  [1] Of course Nietzsche saw afterwards that this was not so.--TR.

  Now, however, such a contrast between popular poetry and individual

poetry does not exist at all; on the contrary, all poetry, and of course popular

poetry  also,  requires  an  intermediary  individuality.  This  much-abused

contrast,  therefore,  is  necessary  only  when  the  term  individual  poem  is

understood to mean a poem which has not grown out of the soil of popular

feeling, but which has been composed by a non-popular poet in a non-popular

atmosphere--something which has come to maturity in the study of a learned

man, for example.

  With the superstition which presupposes poetising masses is connected

another: that popular poetry is limited to one particular period of a people's

history and afterwards dies out--which indeed follows as a consequence of

the first superstition I have mentioned. According to this school, in the place

of the gradually decaying popular poetry we have artistic poetry, the work of

individual minds, not of masses of people. But the same powers which were

once active are still so; and the form in which they act has remained exactly

the same. The great poet of a literary period is still a popular poet in no

narrower  sense  than  the  popular  poet  of  an  illiterate  age.  The  difference

between them is not in the way they originate, but it is their diffusion andpropagation, in short, tradition. This tradition is exposed to eternal danger

without the help of handwriting, and runs the risk of including in the poems

the remains of those individualities through whose oral tradition they were

handed down.

  If we apply all these principles to the Homeric poems, it follows that we

gain nothing with our theory of the poetising soul of the people, and that we

are always referred back to the poetical individual. We are thus confronted

with the task of distinguishing that which can have originated only in a single

poetical mind from that which is, so to speak, swept up by the tide of oral

tradition, and which is a highly important constituent part of the Homeric

poems.

  Since literary history first ceased to be a mere collection of names, people

have  attempted  to  grasp  and  formulate  the  individualities  of  the  poets.  A

certain mechanism forms part of the method: it must be explained--i.e., it

must be deduced from principles--why this or that individuality appears in

this way and not in that. People now study biographical details, environment,

acquaintances,  contemporary  events,  and  believe  that  by  mixing  all  these

ingredients  together  they  will  be  able  to  manufacture  the  wished-for

individuality.  But  they  forget  that  the  punctum  saliens,  the  indefinable

individual characteristics, can never be obtained from a compound of this

nature. The less there is known about the life and times of the poet, the less

applicable is this mechanism. When, however, we have merely the works and

the name of the writer, it is almost impossible to detect the individuality, at

all events, for those who put their faith in the mechanism in question; and

particularly  when  the  works  are  perfect,  when  they  are  pieces  of  popular

poetry.  For  the  best  way  for  these  mechanicians  to  grasp  individual

characteristics is by perceiving deviations from the genius of the people; the

aberrations and hidden allusions: and the fewer discrepancies to be found in a

poem the fainter will be the traces of the individual poet who composed it.

  All  those  deviations,  everything  dull  and  below  the  ordinary  standard

which scholars think they perceive in the Homeric poems, were attributed to

tradition, which thus became the scapegoat. What was left of Homer's own

individual work? Nothing but a series of beautiful and prominent passages

chosen  in  accordance  with  subjective  taste.  The  sum  total  of  aesthetic

singularity which every individual scholar perceived with his own artistic

gifts, he now called Homer.

  This is the central point of the Homeric errors. The name of Homer, fromthe very beginning, has no connection either with the conception of aesthetic

perfection or yet with the Iliad and the Odyssey. Homer as the composer of

the  Iliad  and  the  Odyssey  is  not  a  historical  tradition,  but  an  aesthetic

judgment.

  The only path which leads back beyond the time of Pisistratus and helps

us to elucidate the meaning of the name Homer, takes its way on the one

hand  through  the  reports  which  have  reached  us  concerning  Homer's

birthplace: from which we see that, although his name is always associated

with heroic epic poems, he is on the other hand no more referred to as the

composer of the Iliad and the Odyssey than as the author of the Thebais or

any other cyclical epic. On the other hand, again, an old tradition tells of the

contest between Homer and Hesiod, which proves that when these two names

were  mentioned  people  instinctively  thought  of  two  epic  tendencies,  the

heroic and the didactic; and that the signification of the name "Homer" was

included  in  the  material  category  and  not  in  the  formal.  This  imaginary

contest  with  Hesiod  did  not  even  yet  show  the  faintest  presentiment  of

individuality.  From  the  time  of  Pisistratus  onwards,  however,  with  the

surprisingly  rapid  development  of  the  Greek  feeling  for  beauty,  the

differences in the aesthetic value of those epics continued to be felt more and

more: the Iliad and the Odyssey arose from the depths of the flood and have

remained on the surface ever since. With this process of aesthetic separation,

the  conception  of  Homer  gradually  became  narrower:  the  old  material

meaning of the name "Homer" as the father of the heroic epic poem, was

changed into the aesthetic meaning of Homer, the father of poetry in general,

and likewise its original prototype. This transformation was contemporary

with the rationalistic criticism which made Homer the magician out to be a

possible poet, which vindicated the material and formal traditions of those

numerous epics as against the unity of the poet, and gradually removed that

heavy load of cyclical epics from Homer's shoulders.

  So Homer, the poet of the Iliad and the Odyssey, is an aesthetic judgment.

It is, however, by no means affirmed against the poet of these epics that he

was merely the imaginary being of an aesthetic impossibility, which can be

the opinion of only very few philologists indeed. The majority contend that a

single individual was responsible for the general design of a poem such as the

Iliad,  and  further  that  this  individual  was  Homer.  The  first  part  of  this

contention may be admitted; but, in accordance with what I have said, the

latter part must be denied. And I very much doubt whether the majority ofthose who adopt the first part of the contention have taken the following

considerations into account.

  The design of an epic such as the Iliad is not an entire whole, not an

organism; but a number of pieces strung together, a collection of reflections

arranged in accordance with aesthetic rules. It is certainly the standard of an

artist's greatness to note what he can take in with a single glance and set out

in rhythmical form. The infinite profusion of images and incidents in the

Homeric epic must force us to admit that such a wide range of vision is next

to impossible. Where, however, a poet is unable to observe artistically with a

single glance, he usually piles conception on conception, and endeavours to

adjust his characters according to a comprehensive scheme.

  He will succeed in this all the better the more he is familiar with the

fundamental principles of aesthetics: he will even make some believe that he

made himself master of the entire subject by a single powerful glance.

  The Iliad is not a garland, but a bunch of flowers. As many pictures as

possible are crowded on one canvas; but the man who placed them there was

indifferent as to whether the grouping of the collected pictures was invariably

suitable and rhythmically beautiful. He well knew that no one would ever

consider the collection as a whole; but would merely look at the individual

parts. But that stringing together of some pieces as the manifestations of a

grasp  of  art  which  was  not  yet  highly  developed,  still  less  thoroughly

comprehended and generally esteemed, cannot have been the real Homeric

deed, the real Homeric epoch-making event. On the contrary, this design is a

later product, far later than Homer's celebrity. Those, therefore, who look for

the "original and perfect design" are looking for a mere phantom; for the

dangerous path of oral tradition had reached its end just as the systematic

arrangement appeared on the scene; the disfigurements which were caused on

the way could not have affected the design, for this did not form part of the

material handed down from generation to generation.

  The relative imperfection of the design must not, however, prevent us

from seeing in the designer a different personality from the real poet. It is not

only  probable  that  everything  which  was  created  in  those  times  with

conscious aesthetic insight, was infinitely inferior to the songs that sprang up

naturally in the poet's mind and were written down with instinctive power:

we can even take a step further. If we include the so-called cyclic poems in

this comparison, there remains for the designer of the Iliad and the Odyssey

the  indisputable  merit  of  having  done  something  relatively  great  in  thisconscious technical composing: a merit which we might have been prepared

to recognise from the beginning, and which is in my opinion of the very first

order  in  the  domain  of  instinctive  creation.  We  may  even  be  ready  to

pronounce this synthetisation of great importance. All those dull passages and

discrepancies--deemed of such importance, but really only subjective, which

we usually look upon as the petrified remains of the period of tradition--are

not these perhaps merely the almost necessary evils which must fall to the lot

of  the  poet  of  genius  who  undertakes  a  composition  virtually  without  a

parallel, and, further, one which proves to be of incalculable difficulty?

  Let it be noted that the insight into the most diverse operations of the

instinctive and the conscious changes the position of the Homeric problem;

and in my opinion throws light upon it.

  We believe in a great poet as the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey--but

not that Homer was this poet.

  The decision on this point has already been given. The generation that

invented  those  numerous  Homeric  fables,  that  poetised  the  myth  of  the

contest between Homer and Hesiod, and looked upon all the poems of the

epic cycle as Homeric, did not feel an aesthetic but a material singularity

when  it  pronounced  the  name  "Homer."  This  period  regards  Homer  as

belonging  to  the  ranks  of  artists  like  Orpheus,  Eumolpus,  Daedalus,  and

Olympus,  the  mythical  discoverers  of  a  new  branch  of  art,  to  whom,

therefore, all the later fruits which grew from the new branch were thankfully

dedicated.

  And that wonderful genius to whom we owe the Iliad and the Odyssey

belongs to this thankful posterity: he, too, sacrificed his name on the altar of

the primeval father of the Homeric epic, Homeros.

  Up to this point, gentlemen, I think I have been able to put before you the

fundamental philosophical and aesthetic characteristics of the problem of the

personality of Homer, keeping all minor details rigorously at a distance, on

the supposition that the primary form of this widespread and honeycombed

mountain known as the Homeric question can be most clearly observed by

looking down at it from a far-off height. But I have also, I imagine, recalled

two facts to those friends of antiquity who take such delight in accusing us

philologists of lack of piety for great conceptions and an unproductive zeal

for  destruction.  In  the  first  place,  those  "great"  conceptions--such,  for

example, as that of the indivisible and inviolable poetic genius, Homer--were

during the pre-Wolfian period only too great, and hence inwardly altogetherempty and elusive when we now try to grasp them. If classical philology goes

back again to the same conceptions, and once more tries to pour new wine

into old bottles, it is only on the surface that the conceptions are the same:

everything  has  really  become  new;  bottle  and  mind,  wine  and  word.  We

everywhere find traces of the fact that philology has lived in company with

poets, thinkers, and artists for the last hundred years: whence it has now come

about that the heap of ashes formerly pointed to as classical philology is now

turned into fruitful and even rich soil.[2]

  [2] Nietzsche perceived later on that this statement was, unfortunately,

not justified.--TR.

  And there is a second fact which I should like to recall to the memory of

those  friends  of  antiquity  who  turn  their  dissatisfied  backs  on  classical

philology. You honour the immortal masterpieces of the Hellenic mind in

poetry  and  sculpture,  and  think  yourselves  so  much  more  fortunate  than

preceding generations, which had to do without them; but you must not forget

that this whole fairyland once lay buried under mountains of prejudice, and

that the blood and sweat and arduous labour of innumerable followers of our

science were all necessary to lift up that world from the chasm into which it

had sunk. We grant that philology is not the creator of this world, not the

composer of that immortal music; but is it not a merit, and a great merit, to be

a mere virtuoso, and let the world for the first time hear that music which lay

so  long  in  obscurity,  despised  and  undecipherable?  Who  was  Homer

previously to Wolf's brilliant investigations? A good old man, known at best

as a "natural genius," at all events the child of a barbaric age, replete with

faults against good taste and good morals. Let us hear how a learned man of

the first rank writes about Homer even so late as 1783: "Where does the good

man live? Why did he remain so long incognito? Apropos, can't you get me a

silhouette of him?"

  We demand thanks--not in our own name, for we are but atoms--but in

the name of philology itself, which is indeed neither a Muse nor a Grace, but

a messenger of the gods: and just as the Muses descended upon the dull and

tormented Boeotian peasants, so Philology comes into a world full of gloomy

colours and pictures, full of the deepest, most incurable woes; and speaks to

men comfortingly of the beautiful and godlike figure of a distant, rosy, and

happy fairyland.

  It is time to close; yet before I do so a few words of a personal character

must be added, justified, I hope, by the occasion of this lecture.  It is but right that a philologist should describe his end and the means to it

in the short formula of a confession of faith; and let this be done in the saying

of Seneca which I thus reverse--

    "Philosophia facta est quae philologia fuit."

  By this I wish to signify that all philological activities should be enclosed

and  surrounded  by  a  philosophical  view  of  things,  in  which  everything

individual and isolated is evaporated as something detestable, and in which

great  homogeneous  views  alone  remain.  Now,  therefore,  that  I  have

enunciated my philological creed, I trust you will give me cause to hope that I

shall  no  longer  be  a  stranger  among  you:  give  me  the  assurance  that  in

working with you towards this end I am worthily fulfilling the confidence

with which the highest authorities of this community have honoured me.

              Brief Notes on Nietzsche's Lecture on Rhetoric - 1871

  Nietzsche's treatment of language in this lecture depends heavily of his

close  reading  of  Gustav  Gerber's  Die  Sprache  als  Kunst  (1871).  This

dependence takes the form of extensive paraphrases and even word-for-word

use of Gerber's work. Although Nietzsche refers his students to Gerber, he

does so only to point out Gerber's collection of pleonasms. No where does

Nietzsche acknowledge that the position he is advancing is that of Gerber.

More of this in class.

  Nietzsche's presentation of rhetoric �3 Relationship of the Rhetorical to

Language [II,4 416]

  Aristotle was the first to distinguish rhetoric from dialectic in terms of

their respective goals. Whereas dialectic seeks to demonstrate a truth about

the  essence  of  a  subject  or  thing,  rhetoric  seeks  to  provoke  a  definite

subjective reaction in its audience.

  The rhetorician does not reproduce sense data, but rather the copies of

sense-data. Our sensation of an external object is excited by a nerve stimulus.

This nerve stimulus does not fully and completely assimilate the "thing" that

caused its excitement. The key German term is "Uebertragung" - literally 'to

carry over.' What the 'thing' is that causes the nerve's excitement does not

'carry over' to our sensation: the transition from 'thing' => nerve excitement

=> sensation necessarily transforms the 'thing-in-itself' to a 'thing-for-us.' A'thing-for-us' that we then attempt to re-present through a 'Tonbild' of the

word.

  Nietzsche drives this point home with typical brilliance: how could we

ever assume that our 'Tonbild' can accurately and completely re-present the

'thing'  that  initiated  the  above  process  of  sensing?  A  Tonblid  is  of  a

completely  different  nature  than  the  'thing'  that  initiated  our  chain  of

sensation-representation.  Sick  guessing  game  in  which,  while  blindfolded,

my  hand  is  held  over  a  'flame':  heat  =>  nerve  excites  =>  sensation  =>

verbalization  in  Tonbild:  'a  flame.'  Result?  A  'flame-in-itself'  becomes  a

'flame-for-me,'  that  is,  the  hot  energy  of  fire  is  transformed  into  the

frequencies of air being forced through and shaped by my vocal apparatus.

Indeed, as the game gets sicker, and my hand is held for even longer over the

flame,  the  Tonbild  I  vocalize  is  a  scream.  Here  Nietzsche  interjects  -

bracketing for the moment the problems of transforming external reality into

sound  waves  -  and  asks  how  it  is  possible  for  "an  act  of  the  soul  to  be

presentable in a Tonbild?" [426]. For there to be a perfect reproduction of the

'Seelenact' i.e., the pain I experience, wouldn't the element in which the soul

and voice work have to be the same? Nietzsche writes:

  "The things do not enter into consciousness, but rather the way that we

stand towards the pithanon (sense data). The full essence of the thing is never

grasped.  ...  Instead  of  the  thing  sensation  perceives  only  a  characteristic"

[Ibid.].

  This unavoidable superficial myopia of language distinguishes rhetoric

from dialectic: "the language is rhetoric since it seeks only to carry over a

doxa, not episteme" [Ibid].

  Following Gerber, Nietzsche argues that as long as we communicate in

words -- and not numbers - everything we do is thus a doxa, and that all

language  thus  carries  the  figurative  malleability  of  the  trope.  There  is  no

positivistic 'protocol language' that can accurately reproduce reality in the

sonority of language. All language is tropological:

  "But all words in themselves and from the start are, in terms of their

meaning, tropes. Instead of the true process they represent a Tonbild that

resonates in time: language never expresses something completely, but rather

emphasises but one characteristic that seems to it to stand out..... A one-sided

perception steps in for the entire and full perception [Ibid].

  Following Gerber, there are three key linguistic terms Nietzsche uses to

discuss  the  tropological  essence  of  language:  metonymy,  metaphor  andsynedoche.

  1: Metonymy: "the substitution [Vertauschung] of cause and effect" i.e.,

"We say 'the drink is bitter' instead of 'it excites a particular sensation of that

kind  in  us';  'the  stone  is  hard,'  as  if  hard  were  something  other  than  a

judgment on our part" [II, 4 427]

  What is a word? The expression of a nerve-stimulus in sounds. But to

infer a cause outside us from the nerve-stimulus is already the result of a

wrong and unjustifiable application of the proposition of causality [TL,4]

  2)  Metaphor:  Nietzsche  prefers  to  use  the  German  'Uebertragung'  to

literally render Aristotle's Greek 'metaphorein.' This captures the idea that all

words in a language can have their 'meanings' transferred and exchanged. The

assignment of gender is for Nietzsche proof of how language is constructed

by "arbitrary transferences" and thus "pure metaphor."

  "Metaphor  shows  itself  in  the  designation  of  gender:  genus  in  the

grammatical sense is a luxury of language and pure metaphor" [II, 4 428].

  3) Synedoche: the replacement of an entire and complete intuition by a

partial perception : "A one-sided perception steps in for the entire and full

perception  [II,  4,  426].  Following  Gerber,  Nietzsche's  example  is  how

different  -  and  thus  arbitrary  -  are  the  various  ways  languages  name  the

snake.

listen to the words"

  -1-

  WHAT we here have asserted of the relationship between language and

music must be valid too, for equal reasons, concerning the relationship of

Mime  to  Music.  The  Mime  too,  as  the  intensified  symbolism  of  man's

gestures, is, measured by the eternal significance of music, only a simile,

which  brings  into  expression  the  innermost  secret  of  music  but  very

superficially, namely on the substratum of the passionately moved human

body. But if we include language also in the category of bodily symbolism,

and compare the drama, according to the canon advanced, with music, then I

venture to think, a proposition of Schopenhauer will come into the clearest

light,  to  which  reference  must  be  made  again  later  on.  "  It  might  be

admissible, although a purely musical mind does not demand it, to join and

adapt words or even a clearly represented action to the pure language of

tones, although the latter, being self-sufficient, needs no help; so that ourperceiving and reflecting intellect, which does not like to be quite idle, may

meanwhile have light and analogous occupation also. By this concession to

the intellect man's attention adheres even more closely to music, by this at the

same time, too, is placed underneath that which the tones indicate in their

general metaphorless language of the heart, a visible picture, as it were a

schema, as an example illustrating a general idea . . . indeed such things will

even  heighten  the  effect  of  music."  (Schopenhauer,  Parerga,  11.,  "On  the

Metaphysics of the Beautiful and Aesthetics," � 224.) If we disregard the

naturalistic  external  motivation  according  to  which  our  perceiving  and

reflecting intellect does not like to be quite idle when listening to music, and

attention led by the hand of an obvious action follows better-then the drama

in relation to music has been characterized by Schopenhauer for the best

reasons as a schema, as an example illustrating a general idea: and when he

adds "indeed such things will even heighten the effect of music " then the

enormous universality and originality of vocal music, of the connection of

tone with metaphor and idea guarantee the correctness of this utterance. The

music of every people begins in closest connection with lyricism and long

before  absolute  music  can  be  thought  of,  the  music  of  a  people  in  that

connection passes through the most important stages of development. If we

understand this primal lyricism of a people, as indeed we must, to be an

imitation of the artistic typifying Nature, then as the original prototype of that

union of music and lyricism must be regarded : the duality in the essence of

language, already typified by Nature. Now, after discussing the relation of

music to metaphor we will fathom more deeply this essence of language.

  In the multiplicity of languages the fact at once manifests itself, that word

and thing do not necessarily coincide with one another completely, but that

the word is a symbol. But what does the word symbolize ? Most certainly

only conceptions, be these now conscious ones or as in the greater number of

cases,  unconscious;  for  how  should  a  word-symbol  correspond  to  that

innermost nature of which we and the world are images? Only as conceptions

we know that kernel, only in its metaphorical expressions are we familiar

with it; beyond that point there is nowhere a direct bridge which could lead

us to it. The whole life of impulses, too, the play of feelings, sensations,

emotions, volitions, is known to us-as I am forced to insert here in opposition

to  Schopenhauer-after  a  most  rigid  self-examination,  not  according  to  its

essence but merely as conception; and we may well be permitted to say, that

even  Schopenhauer's  "  Will  "  is  nothing  else  but  the  most  general
