majority that we hear the ever-resounding call for the establishment of new

public schools and higher educational institutions: we are living in an age

which,  by  ringing  the  changes  on  its  deafening  and  continual  cry,  would

certainly give one the impression that there was an unprecedented thirst for

culture which eagerly sought to be quenched. But it is just at this point that

one should learn to hear aright: it is here, without being disconcerted by the

thundering noise of the education-mongers, that we must confront those who

talk so tirelessly about the educational necessities of their time. Then we

should meet with a strange disillusionment, one which we, my good friend,

have  often  met  with:  those  blatant  heralds  of  educational  needs,  when

examined at close quarters, are suddenly seen to be transformed into zealous,

yea, fanatical opponents of true culture, i.e. all those who hold fast to the

aristocratic nature of the mind; for, at bottom, they regard as their goal the

emancipation of the masses from the mastery of the great few; they seek to

overthrow  the  most  sacred  hierarchy  in  the  kingdom  of  the  intellect--the

servitude of the masses, their submissive obedience, their instinct of loyalty

to the rule of genius.

  "I have long accustomed myself to look with caution upon those who are

ardent in the cause of the so-called 'education of the people' in the common

meaning of the phrase; since for the most part they desire for themselves,

consciously  or  unconsciously,  absolutely  unlimited  freedom,  which  must

inevitably degenerate into something resembling the saturnalia of barbaric

times, and which the sacred hierarchy of nature will never grant them. They

were born to serve and to obey; and every moment in which their limping or

crawling  or  broken-winded  thoughts  are  at  work  shows  us  clearly  out  of

which clay nature moulded them, and what trade mark she branded thereon.

The education of the masses cannot, therefore, be our aim; but rather the

education of a few picked men for great and lasting works. We well know

that a just posterity judges the collective intellectual state of a time only by

those few great and lonely figures of the period, and gives its decision in

accordance with the manner in which they are recognised, encouraged, and

honoured, or, on the other hand, in which they are snubbed, elbowed aside,

and  kept  down.  What  is  called  the  'education  of  the  masses'  cannot  be

accomplished  except  with  difficulty;  and  even  if  a  system  of  universal

compulsory education be applied, they can only be reached outwardly: those

individual  lower  levels  where,  generally  speaking,  the  masses  come  into

contact with culture, where the people nourishes its religious instinct, whereit poetises its mythological images, where it keeps up its faith in its customs,

privileges, native soil, and language--all these levels can scarcely be reached

by direct means, and in any case only by violent demolition. And, in serious

matters of this kind, to hasten forward the progress of the education of the

people means simply the postponement of this violent demolition, and the

maintenance  of  that  wholesome  unconsciousness,  that  sound  sleep,  of  the

people,  without  which  counter-action  and  remedy  no  culture,  with  the

exhausting strain and excitement of its own actions, can make any headway.

  "We know, however, what the aspiration is of those who would disturb

the healthy slumber of the people, and continually call out to them: 'Keep

your eyes open! Be sensible! Be wise!' we know the aim of those who profess

to satisfy excessive educational requirements by means of an extraordinary

increase in the number of educational institutions and the conceited tribe of

teachers originated thereby. These very people, using these very means, are

fighting  against  the  natural  hierarchy  in  the  realm  of  the  intellect,  and

destroying the roots of all those noble and sublime plastic forces which have

their material origin in the unconsciousness of the people, and which fittingly

terminate  in  the  procreation  of  genius  and  its  due  guidance  and  proper

training. It is only in the simile of the mother that we can grasp the meaning

and the responsibility of the true education of the people in respect to genius:

its real origin is not to be found in such education; it has, so to speak, only a

metaphysical source, a metaphysical home. But for the genius to make his

appearance;  for  him  to  emerge  from  among  the  people;  to  portray  the

reflected picture, as it were, the dazzling brilliancy of the peculiar colours of

this people; to depict the noble destiny of a people in the similitude of an

individual in a work which will last for all time, thereby making his nation

itself eternal, and redeeming it from the ever-shifting element of transient

things: all this is possible for the genius only when he has been brought up

and come to maturity in the tender care of the culture of a people; whilst, on

the other hand, without this sheltering home, the genius will not, generally

speaking, be able to rise to the height of his eternal flight, but will at an early

moment, like a stranger weather-driven upon a bleak, snow-covered desert,

slink away from the inhospitable land."

  "You astonish me with such a metaphysics of genius," said the teacher's

companion,  "and  I  have  only  a  hazy  conception  of  the  accuracy  of  your

similitude. On the other hand, I fully understand what you have said about the

surplus  of  public  schools  and  the  corresponding  surplus  of  higher  gradeteachers; and in this regard I myself have collected some information which

assures me that the educational tendency of the public school must right itself

by this very surplus of teachers who have really nothing at all to do with

education,  and  who  are  called  into  existence  and  pursue  this  path  solely

because  there  is  a  demand  for  them.  Every  man  who,  in  an  unexpected

moment  of  enlightenment,  has  convinced  himself  of  the  singularity  and

inaccessibility of Hellenic antiquity, and has warded off this conviction after

an exhausting struggle--every such man knows that the door leading to this

enlightenment will never remain open to all comers; and he deems it absurd,

yea disgraceful, to use the Greeks as he would any other tool he employs

when following his profession or earning his living, shamelessly fumbling

with coarse hands amidst the relics of these holy men. This brazen and vulgar

feeling is, however, most common in the profession from which the largest

numbers  of  teachers  for  the  public  schools  are  drawn,  the  philological

profession, wherefore the reproduction and continuation of such a feeling in

the public school will not surprise us.

  "Just look at the younger generation of philologists: how seldom we see

in them that humble feeling that we, when compared with such a world as it

was, have no right to exist at all: how coolly and fearlessly, as compared with

us,  did  that  young  brood  build  its  miserable  nests  in  the  midst  of  the

magnificent temples! A powerful voice from every nook and cranny should

ring in the ears of those who, from the day they begin their connection with

the university, roam at will with such self-complacency and shamelessness

among  the  awe-inspiring  relics  of  that  noble  civilisation:  'Hence,  ye

uninitiated, who will never be initiated; fly away in silence and shame from

these sacred chambers!' But this voice speaks in vain; for one must to some

extent be a Greek to understand a Greek curse of excommunication. But these

people I am speaking of are so barbaric that they dispose of these relics to

suit themselves: all their modern conveniences and fancies are brought with

them and concealed among those ancient pillars and tombstones, and it gives

rise to great rejoicing when somebody finds, among the dust and cobwebs of

antiquity, something that he himself had slyly hidden there not so very long

before.  One  of  them  makes  verses  and  takes  care  to  consult  Hesychius'

Lexicon. Something there immediately assures him that he is destined to be

an  imitator  of �schylus,  and  leads  him  to  believe,  indeed,  that  he  'has

something in common with' �schylus: the miserable poetaster! Yet another

peers with the suspicious eye of a policeman into every contradiction, eveninto  the  shadow  of  every  contradiction,  of  which  Homer  was  guilty:  he

fritters  away  his  life  in  tearing  Homeric  rags  to  tatters  and  sewing  them

together  again,  rags  that  he  himself  was  the  first  to  filch  from  the  poet's

kingly robe. A third feels ill at ease when examining all the mysterious and

orgiastic sides of antiquity: he makes up his mind once and for all to let the

enlightened Apollo alone pass without dispute, and to see in the Athenian a

gay and intelligent but nevertheless somewhat immoral Apollonian. What a

deep breath he draws when he succeeds in raising yet another dark corner of

antiquity  to  the  level  of  his  own  intelligence!--when,  for  example,  he

discovers  in  Pythagoras  a  colleague  who  is  as  enthusiastic  as  himself  in

arguing  about  politics.  Another  racks  his  brains  as  to  why �dipus  was

condemned  by  fate  to  perform  such  abominable  deeds--killing  his  father,

marrying  his  mother.  Where  lies  the  blame!  Where  the  poetic  justice!

Suddenly  it  occurs  to  him: �dipus  was  a  passionate  fellow,  lacking  all

Christian gentleness--he even fell into an unbecoming rage when Tiresias

called him a monster and the curse of the whole country. Be humble and

meek! was what Sophocles tried to teach, otherwise you will have to marry

your mothers and kill your fathers! Others, again, pass their lives in counting

the number of verses written by Greek and Roman poets, and are delighted

with the proportions 7:13 = 14:26. Finally, one of them brings forward his

solution  of  a  question,  such  as  the  Homeric  poems  considered  from  the

standpoint of prepositions, and thinks he has drawn the truth from the bottom

of the well with ??? and ?at?. All of them, however, with the most widely

separated aims in view, dig and burrow in Greek soil with a restlessness and a

blundering  awkwardness  that  must  surely  be  painful  to  a  true  friend  of

antiquity: and thus it comes to pass that I should like to take by the hand

every talented or talentless man who feels a certain professional inclination

urging him on to the study of antiquity, and harangue him as follows: 'Young

sir, do you know what perils threaten you, with your little stock of school

learning, before you become a man in the full sense of the word? Have you

heard that, according to Aristotle, it is by no means a tragic death to be slain

by  a  statue?  Does  that  surprise  you?  Know,  then,  that  for  centuries

philologists have been trying, with ever-failing strength, to re-erect the fallen

statue of Greek antiquity, but without success; for it is a colossus around

which single individual men crawl like pygmies. The leverage of the united

representatives of modern culture is utilised for the purpose; but it invariably

happens that the huge column is scarcely more than lifted from the groundwhen it falls down again, crushing beneath its weight the luckless wights

under it. That, however, may be tolerated, for every being must perish by

some means or other; but who is there to guarantee that during all these

attempts the statue itself will not break in pieces! The philologists are being

crushed by the Greeks--perhaps we can put up with this--but antiquity itself

threatens to be crushed by these philologists! Think that over, you easy-going

young man; and turn back, lest you too should not be an iconoclast!'"

  "Indeed,"  said  the  philosopher,  laughing,  "there  are  many  philologists

who have turned back as you so much desire, and I notice a great contrast

with  my  own  youthful  experience.  Consciously  or  unconsciously,  large

numbers of them have concluded that it is hopeless and useless for them to

come into direct contact with classical antiquity, hence they are inclined to

look upon this study as barren, superseded, out-of-date. This herd has turned

with much greater zest to the science of language: here in this wide expanse

of virgin soil, where even the most mediocre gifts can be turned to account,

and where a kind of insipidity and dullness is even looked upon as decided

talent, with the novelty and uncertainty of methods and the constant danger of

making fantastic mistakes--here, where dull regimental routine and discipline

are desiderata--here the newcomer is no longer frightened by the majestic and

warning  voice  that  rises  from  the  ruins  of  antiquity:  here  every  one  is

welcomed  with  open  arms,  including  even  him  who  never  arrived  at  any

uncommon impression or noteworthy thought after a perusal of Sophocles

and Aristophanes, with the result that they end in an etymological tangle, or

are  seduced  into  collecting  the  fragments  of  out-of-the-way  dialects--and

their time is spent in associating and dissociating, collecting and scattering,

and  running  hither  and  thither  consulting  books.  And  such  a  usefully

employed philologist would now fain be a teacher! He now undertakes to

teach the youth of the public schools something about the ancient writers,

although he himself has read them without any particular impression, much

less  with  insight!  What  a  dilemma!  Antiquity  has  said  nothing  to  him,

consequently he has nothing to say about antiquity. A sudden thought strikes

him: why is he a skilled philologist at all! Why did these authors write Latin

and Greek! And with a light heart he immediately begins to etymologise with

Homer, calling Lithuanian or Ecclesiastical Slavonic, or, above all, the sacred

Sanskrit, to his assistance: as if Greek lessons were merely the excuse for a

general introduction to the study of languages, and as if Homer were lacking

in only one respect, namely, not being written in pre-Indogermanic. Whoeveris acquainted with our present public schools well knows what a wide gulf

separates their teachers from classicism, and how, from a feeling of this want,

comparative philology and allied professions have increased their numbers to

such an unheard-of degree."

  "What I mean is," said the other, "it would depend upon whether a teacher

of classical culture did not confuse his Greeks and Romans with the other

peoples, the barbarians, whether he could never put Greek and Latin on a

level with other languages: so far as his classicalism is concerned, it is a

matter  of  indifference  whether  the  framework  of  these  languages  concurs

with or is in any way related to the other languages: such a concurrence does

not interest him at all; his real concern is with what is not common to both,

with what shows him that those two peoples were not barbarians as compared

with the others--in so far, of course, as he is a true teacher of culture and

models himself after the majestic patterns of the classics."

  "I may be wrong," said the philosopher, "but I suspect that, owing to the

way in which Latin and Greek are now taught in schools, the accurate grasp

of these languages, the ability to speak and write them with ease, is lost, and

that  is  something  in  which  my  own  generation  distinguished  itself--a

generation, indeed, whose few survivers have by this time grown old; whilst,

on the other hand, the present teachers seem to impress their pupils with the

genetic and historical importance of the subject to such an extent that, at best,

their scholars ultimately turn into little Sanskritists, etymological spitfires, or

reckless conjecturers; but not one of them can read his Plato or Tacitus with

pleasure, as we old folk can. The public schools may still be seats of learning:

not,  however  of  the  learning  which,  as  it  were,  is  only  the  natural  and

involuntary auxiliary of a culture that is directed towards the noblest ends;

but rather of that culture which might be compared to the hypertrophical

swelling of an unhealthy body. The public schools are certainly the seats of

this obesity, if, indeed, they have not degenerated into the abodes of that

elegant  barbarism  which  is  boasted  of  as  being  'German  culture  of  the

present!'"

  "But," asked the other, "what is to become of that large body of teachers

who have not been endowed with a true gift for culture, and who set up as

teachers merely to gain a livelihood from the profession, because there is a

demand for them, because a superfluity of schools brings with it a superfluity

of teachers? Where shall they go when antiquity peremptorily orders them to

withdraw? Must they not be sacrificed to those powers of the present who,day after day, call out to them from the never-ending columns of the press

'We are culture! We are education! We are at the zenith! We are the apexes of

the pyramids! We are the aims of universal history!'--when they hear the

seductive  promises,  when  the  shameful  signs  of  non-culture,  the  plebeian

publicity of the so-called 'interests of culture' are extolled for their benefit in

magazines and newspapers as an entirely new and the best possible, full-

grown form of culture! Whither shall the poor fellows fly when they feel the

presentiment that these promises are not true--where but to the most obtuse,

sterile scientificality, that here the shriek of culture may no longer be audible

to them? Pursued in this way, must they not end, like the ostrich, by burying

their heads in the sand? Is it not a real happiness for them, buried as they are

among dialects, etymologies, and conjectures, to lead a life like that of the

ants, even though they are miles removed from true culture, if only they can

close their ears tightly and be deaf to the voice of the 'elegant' culture of the

time."

  "You are right, my friend," said the philosopher, "but whence comes the

urgent necessity for a surplus of schools for culture, which further gives rise

to the necessity for a surplus of teachers?--when we so clearly see that the

demand for a surplus springs from a sphere which is hostile to culture, and

that the consequences of this surplus only lead to non-culture. Indeed, we can

discuss this dire necessity only in so far as the modern State is willing to

discuss these things with us, and is prepared to follow up its demands by

force: which phenomenon certainly makes the same impression upon most

people as if they were addressed by the eternal law of things. For the rest, a

'Culture-State,' to use the current expression, which makes such demands, is

rather a novelty, and has only come to a 'self-understanding' within the last

half century, i.e. in a period when (to use the favourite popular word) so

many 'self-understood' things came into being, but which are in themselves

not 'self-understood' at all. This right to higher education has been taken so

seriously  by  the  most  powerful  of  modern  States--Prussia--that  the

objectionable  principle  it  has  adopted,  taken  in  connection  with  the  well-

known daring and hardihood of this State, is seen to have a menacing and

dangerous consequence for the true German spirit; for we see endeavours

being made in this quarter to raise the public school, formally systematised,

up to the so-called 'level of the time.' Here is to be found all that mechanism

by means of which as many scholars as possible are urged on to take up

courses  of  public  school  training:  here,  indeed,  the  State  has  its  mostpowerful inducement--the concession of certain privileges respecting military

service,  with  the  natural  consequence  that,  according  to  the  unprejudiced

evidence of statistical officials, by this, and by this only, can we explain the

universal  congestion  of  all  Prussian  public  schools,  and  the  urgent  and

continual need for new ones. What more can the State do for a surplus of

educational institutions than bring all the higher and the majority of the lower

civil service appointments, the right of entry to the universities, and even the

most influential military posts into close connection with the public school:

and all this in a country where both universal military service and the highest

offices  of  the  State  unconsciously  attract  all  gifted  natures  to  them.  The

public school is here looked upon as an honourable aim, and every one who

feels himself urged on to the sphere of government will be found on his way

to  it.  This  is  a  new  and  quite  original  occurrence:  the  State  assumes  the

attitude of a mystogogue of culture, and, whilst it promotes its own ends, it

obliges every one of its servants not to appear in its presence without the

torch of universal State education in their hands, by the flickering light of

which they may again recognise the State as the highest goal, as the reward of

all their strivings after education.

  "Now this last phenomenon should indeed surprise them; it should remind

them of that allied, slowly understood tendency of a philosophy which was

formerly promoted for reasons of State, namely, the tendency of the Hegelian

philosophy:  yea,  it  would  perhaps  be  no  exaggeration  to  say  that,  in  the

subordination of all strivings after education to reasons of State, Prussia has

appropriated,  with  success,  the  principle  and  the  useful  heirloom  of  the

Hegelian  philosophy,  whose  apotheosis  of  the  State  in  this  subordination

certainly reaches its height."

  "But," said the philosopher's companion, "what purposes can the State

have in view with such a strange aim? For that it has some State objects in

view is seen in the manner in which the conditions of Prussian schools are

admired by, meditated upon, and occasionally imitated by other States. These

other  States  obviously  presuppose  something  here  that,  if  adopted,  would

tend towards the maintenance and power of the State, like our well-known

and  popular  conscription.  Where  everyone  proudly  wears  his  soldier's

uniform at regular intervals, where almost every one has absorbed a uniform

type of national culture through the public schools, enthusiastic hyperboles

may well be uttered concerning the systems employed in former times, and a

form of State omnipotence which was attained only in antiquity, and whichalmost  every  young  man,  by  both  instinct  and  training,  thinks  it  is  the

crowning glory and highest aim of human beings to reach."

  "Such a comparison," said the philosopher, "would be quite hyperbolical,

and would not hobble along on one leg only. For, indeed, the ancient State

emphatically  did  not  share  the  utilitarian  point  of  view  of  recognising  as

culture only what was directly useful to the State itself, and was far from

wishing to destroy those impulses which did not seem to be immediately

applicable. For this very reason the profound Greek had for the State that

strong  feeling  of  admiration  and  thankfulness  which  is  so  distasteful  to

modern men; because he clearly recognised not only that without such State

protection the germs of his culture could not develop, but also that all his

inimitable and perennial culture had flourished so luxuriantly under the wise

and careful guardianship of the protection afforded by the State. The State

was for his culture not a supervisor, regulator, and watchman, but a vigorous

and muscular companion and friend, ready for war, who accompanied his

noble, admired, and, as it were, ethereal friend through disagreeable reality,

earning his thanks therefor. This, however, does not happen when a modern

State lays claim to such hearty gratitude because it renders such chivalrous

service to German culture and art: for in this regard its past is as ignominious

as its present, as a proof of which we have but to think of the manner in

which the memory of our great poets and artists is celebrated in German

cities, and how the highest objects of these German masters are supported on

the part of the State.

  "There must therefore be peculiar circumstances surrounding both this

purpose towards which the State is tending, and which always promotes what

is here called 'education'; and surrounding likewise the culture thus promoted,

which subordinates itself to this purpose of the State. With the real German

spirit and the education derived therefrom, such as I have slowly outlined for

you, this purpose of the State is at war, hiddenly or openly: the spirit of

education, which is welcomed and encouraged with such interest by the State,

and owing to which the schools of this country are so much admired abroad,

must accordingly originate in a sphere that never comes into contact with this

true German spirit: with that spirit which speaks to us so wondrously from

the  inner  heart  of  the  German  Reformation,  German  music,  and  German

philosophy, and which, like a noble exile, is regarded with such indifference

and scorn by the luxurious education afforded by the State. This spirit is a

stranger: it passes by in solitary sadness, and far away from it the censer ofpseudo-culture  is  swung  backwards  and  forwards,  which,  amidst  the

acclamations of 'educated' teachers and journalists, arrogates to itself its name

and privileges, and metes out insulting treatment to the word 'German.' Why

does the State require that surplus of educational institutions, of teachers?

Why this education of the masses on such an extended scale? Because the

true German spirit is hated, because the aristocratic nature of true culture is

feared,  because  the  people  endeavour  in  this  way  to  drive  single  great

individuals into self-exile, so that the claims of the masses to education may

be, so to speak, planted down and carefully tended, in order that the many

may in this way endeavour to escape the rigid and strict discipline of the few

great leaders, so that the masses may be persuaded that they can easily find

the path for themselves--following the guiding star of the State!

  "A new phenomenon! The State as the guiding star of culture! In the

meantime  one  thing  consoles  me:  this  German  spirit,  which  people  are

combating so much, and for which they have substituted a gaudily attired

locum tenens, this spirit is brave: it will fight and redeem itself into a purer

age; noble, as it is now, and victorious, as it one day will be, it will always

preserve in its mind a certain pitiful toleration of the State, if the latter, hard-

pressed  in  the  hour  of  extremity,  secures  such  a  pseudo-culture  as  its

associate.  For  what,  after  all,  do  we  know  about  the  difficult  task  of

governing men, i.e. to keep law, order, quietness, and peace among millions

of  boundlessly  egoistical,  unjust,  unreasonable,  dishonourable,  envious,

malignant, and hence very narrow-minded and perverse human beings; and

thus to protect the few things that the State has conquered for itself against

covetous neighbours and jealous robbers? Such a hard-pressed State holds

out its arms to any associate, grasps at any straw; and when such an associate

does introduce himself with flowery eloquence, when he adjudges the State,

as Hegel did, to be an 'absolutely complete ethical organism,' the be-all and

end-all of every one's education, and goes on to indicate how he himself can

best  promote  the  interests  of  the  State--who  will  be  surprised  if,  without

further parley, the State falls upon his neck and cries aloud in a barbaric voice

of full conviction: 'Yes! Thou art education! Thou art indeed culture!'"

                                  FOURTH LECTURE.

    (Delivered on the 5th of March 1872.)

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--Now that you have followed my tale up

to this point, and that we have made ourselves joint masters of the solitary,

remote, and at times abusive duologue of the philosopher and his companion,I sincerely hope that you, like strong swimmers, are ready to proceed on the

second half of our journey, especially as I can promise you that a few other

marionettes will appear in the puppet-play of my adventure, and that if up to

the present you have only been able to do little more than endure what I have

been telling you, the waves of my story will now bear you more quickly and

easily towards the end. In other words we have now come to a turning, and it

would be advisable for us to take a short glance backwards to see what we

think we have gained from such a varied conversation.

  "Remain in your present position," the philosopher seemed to say to his

companion, "for you may cherish hopes. It is more and more clearly evident

that we have no educational institutions at all; but that we ought to have

them. Our public schools--established, it would seem, for this high object--

have either become the nurseries of a reprehensible culture which repels the

true culture with profound hatred--i.e. a true, aristocratic culture, founded

upon a few carefully chosen minds; or they foster a micrological and sterile

learning which, while it is far removed from culture, has at least this merit,

that  it  avoids  that  reprehensible  culture  as  well  as  the  true  culture."  The

philosopher had particularly drawn his companion's attention to the strange

corruption which must have entered into the heart of culture when the State

thought itself capable of tyrannising over it and of attaining its ends through

it;  and  further  when  the  State,  in  conjunction  with  this  culture,  struggled

against other hostile forces as well as against the spirit which the philosopher

ventured to call the "true German spirit." This spirit, linked to the Greeks by

the noblest ties, and shown by its past history to have been steadfast and

courageous, pure and lofty in its aims, its faculties qualifying it for the high

task  of  freeing  modern  man  from  the  curse  of  modernity--this  spirit  is

condemned to live apart, banished from its inheritance. But when its slow,

painful  tones  of  woe  resound  through  the  desert  of  the  present,  then  the

overladen  and  gaily-decked  caravan  of  culture  is  pulled  up  short,  horror-

stricken. We must not only astonish, but terrify--such was the philosopher's

opinion: not to fly shamefully away, but to take the offensive, was his advice;

but he especially counselled his companion not to ponder too anxiously over

the individual from whom, through a higher instinct, this aversion for the

present barbarism proceeded, "Let it perish: the Pythian god had no difficulty

in finding a new tripod, a second Pythia, so long, at least, as the mystic cold

vapours rose from the earth."

  The philosopher once more began to speak: "Be careful to remember, myfriend," said he, "there are two things you must not confuse. A man must

learn a great deal that he may live and take part in the struggle for existence;

but everything that he as an individual learns and does with this end in view

has nothing whatever to do with culture. This latter only takes its beginning

in a sphere that lies far above the world of necessity, indigence, and struggle

for existence. The question now is to what extent a man values his ego in

comparison with other egos, how much of his strength he uses up in the

endeavour to earn his living. Many a one, by stoically confining his needs

within a narrow compass, will shortly and easily reach the sphere in which he

may forget, and, as it were, shake off his ego, so that he can enjoy perpetual

youth in a solar system of timeless and impersonal things. Another widens

the  scope  and  needs  of  his  ego  as  much  as  possible,  and  builds  the

mausoleum of this ego in vast proportions, as if he were prepared to fight and

conquer  that  terrible  adversary,  Time.  In  this  instinct  also  we  may  see  a

longing  for  immortality:  wealth  and  power,  wisdom,  presence  of  mind,

eloquence,  a  flourishing  outward  aspect,  a  renowned  name--all  these  are

merely turned into the means by which an insatiable, personal will to live

craves for new life, with which, again, it hankers after an eternity that is at

last seen to be illusory.

  "But even in this highest form of the ego, in the enhanced needs of such a

distended and, as it were, collective individual, true culture is never touched

upon;  and  if,  for  example,  art  is  sought  after,  only  its  disseminating  and

stimulating actions come into prominence, i.e. those which least give rise to

pure and noble art, and most of all to low and degraded forms of it. For in all

his  efforts,  however  great  and  exceptional  they  seem  to  the  onlooker,  he

never  succeeds  in  freeing  himself  from  his  own  hankering  and  restless

personality:  that  illuminated,  ethereal  sphere  where  one  may  contemplate

without the obstruction of one's own personality continually recedes from

him--and thus, let him learn, travel, and collect as he may, he must always

live  an  exiled  life  at  a  remote  distance  from  a  higher  life  and  from  true

culture. For true culture would scorn to contaminate itself with the needy and

covetous individual; it well knows how to give the slip to the man who would

fain  employ  it  as  a  means  of  attaining  to  egoistic  ends;  and  if  any  one

cherishes the belief that he has firmly secured it as a means of livelihood, and

that he can procure the necessities of life by its sedulous cultivation, then it

suddenly steals away with noiseless steps and an air of derisive mockery.[6]

  "I will thus ask you, my friend, not to confound this culture, this sensitive,fastidious, ethereal goddess, with that useful maid-of-all-work which is also

called 'culture,' but which is only the intellectual servant and counsellor of

one's  practical  necessities,  wants,  and  means  of  livelihood  Every  kind  of

training, however, which holds out the prospect of bread-winning as its end

and aim, is not a training for culture as we understand the word; but merely a

collection  of  precepts  and  directions  to  show  how,  in  the  struggle  for

existence, a man may preserve and protect his own person. It may be freely

admitted that for the great majority of men such a course of instruction is of

the  highest  importance;  and  the  more  arduous  the  struggle  is  the  more

intensely must the young man strain every nerve to utilise his strength to the

best advantage.

  "But--let no one think for a moment that the schools which urge him on to

this struggle and prepare him for it are in any way seriously to be considered

as establishments of culture. They are institutions which teach one how to

take part in the battle of life; whether they promise to turn out civil servants,

or merchants, or officers, or wholesale dealers, or farmers, or physicians, or

men with a technical training. The regulations and standards prevailing at

such institutions differ from those in a true educational institution; and what

in the latter is permitted, and even freely held out as often as possible, ought

to be considered as a criminal offence in the former.

  "Let me give you an example. If you wish to guide a young man on the

path of true culture, beware of interrupting his naive, confident, and, as it

were, immediate and personal relationship with nature. The woods, the rocks,

the winds, the vulture, the flowers, the butterfly, the meads, the mountain

slopes, must all speak to him in their own language; in them he must, as it

were, come to know himself again in countless reflections and images, in a

variegated round of changing visions; and in this way he will unconsciously

and gradually feel the metaphysical unity of all things in the great image of

nature, and at the same time tranquillise his soul in the contemplation of her

eternal  endurance  and  necessity.  But  how  many  young  men  should  be

permitted to grow up in such close and almost personal proximity to nature!

The  others  must  learn  another  truth  betimes:  how  to  subdue  nature  to

themselves. Here is an end of this naive metaphysics; and the physiology of

plants  and  animals,  geology,  inorganic  chemistry,  force  their  devotees  to

view nature from an altogether different standpoint. What is lost by this new

point of view is not only a poetical phantasmagoria, but the instinctive, true,

and  unique  point  of  view,  instead  of  which  we  have  shrewd  and  clevercalculations,  and,  so  to  speak,  overreachings  of  nature.  Thus  to  the  truly

cultured man is vouchsafed the inestimable benefit of being able to remain

faithful, without a break, to the contemplative instincts of his childhood, and

so to attain to a calmness, unity, consistency, and harmony which can never

be even thought of by a man who is compelled to fight in the struggle for

existence.

  "You must not think, however, that I wish to withhold all praise from our

primary and secondary schools: I honour the seminaries where boys learn

arithmetic  and  master  modern  languages,  and  study  geography  and  the

marvellous discoveries made in natural science. I am quite prepared to say

further  that  those  youths  who  pass  through  the  better  class  of  secondary

schools are well entitled to make the claims put forward by the fully-fledged

public school boy; and the time is certainly not far distant when such pupils

will be everywhere freely admitted to the universities and positions under the

government, which has hitherto been the case only with scholars from the

public  schools--of  our  present  public  schools,  be  it  noted![7]  I  cannot,

however,  refrain  from  adding  the  melancholy  reflection:  if  it  be  true  that

secondary  and  public  schools  are,  on  the  whole,  working  so  heartily  in

common towards the same ends, and differ from each other only in such a

slight degree, that they may take equal rank before the tribunal of the State,

then we completely lack another kind of educational institutions: those for the

development of culture! To say the least, the secondary schools cannot be

reproached  with  this;  for  they  have  up  to  the  present  propitiously  and

honourably followed up tendencies of a lower order, but one nevertheless

highly necessary. In the public schools, however, there is very much less

honesty and very much less ability too; for in them we find an instinctive

feeling  of  shame,  the  unconscious  perception  of  the  fact  that  the  whole

institution has been ignominiously degraded, and that the sonorous words of

wise  and  apathetic  teachers  are  contradictory  to  the  dreary,  barbaric,  and

sterile reality. So there are no true cultural institutions! And in those very

places where a pretence to culture is still kept up, we find the people more

hopeless, atrophied, and discontented than in the secondary schools, where

the  so-called  'realistic'  subjects  are  taught!  Besides  this,  only  think  how

immature and uninformed one must be in the company of such teachers when

one actually misunderstands the rigorously defined philosophical expressions

'real' and 'realism' to such a degree as to think them the contraries of mind

and matter, and to interpret 'realism' as 'the road to knowledge, formation,and mastery of reality.'

  "I for my own part know of only two exact contraries: institutions for

teaching culture and institutions for teaching how to succeed in life. All our

present institutions belong to the second class; but I am speaking only of the

first."

  About  two  hours  went  by  while  the  philosophically-minded  couple

chatted about such startling questions. Night slowly fell in the meantime; and

when in the twilight the philosopher's voice had sounded like natural music

through the woods, it now rang out in the profound darkness of the night

when he was speaking with excitement or even passionately; his tones hissing

and thundering far down the valley, and reverberating among the trees and

rocks. Suddenly he was silent: he had just repeated, almost pathetically, the

words, "we have no true educational institutions; we have no true educational

institutions!" when something fell down just in front of him--it might have

been a fir-cone--and his dog barked and ran towards it. Thus interrupted, the

philosopher raised his head, and suddenly became aware of the darkness, the

cool air, and the lonely situation of himself and his companion. "Well! What

are we about!" he ejaculated, "it's dark. You know whom we were expecting

here; but he hasn't come. We have waited in vain; let us go."

  * * * * *

  I  must  now,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  convey  to  you  the  impressions

experienced  by  my  friend  and  myself  as  we  eagerly  listened  to  this

conversation, which we heard distinctly in our hiding-place. I have already

told you that at that place and at that hour we had intended to hold a festival

in commemoration of something: and this something had to do with nothing

else than matters concerning educational training, of which we, in our own

youthful opinions, had garnered a plentiful harvest during our past life. We

were thus disposed to remember with gratitude the institution which we had

at one time thought out for ourselves at that very spot in order, as I have

already mentioned, that we might reciprocally encourage and watch over one

another's  educational  impulses.  But  a  sudden  and  unexpected  light  was

thrown on all that past life as we silently gave ourselves up to the vehement

words  of  the  philosopher.  As  when  a  traveller,  walking  heedlessly  across

unknown ground, suddenly puts his foot over the edge of a cliff, so it now

seemed to us that we had hastened to meet the great danger rather than run

away from it. Here at this spot, so memorable to us, we heard the warning:

"Back! Not another step! Know you not whither your footsteps tend, whitherthis deceitful path is luring you?"

  It  seemed  to  us  that  we  now  knew,  and  our  feeling  of  overflowing

thankfulness impelled us so irresistibly towards our earnest counsellor and

trusty  Eckart,  that  both  of  us  sprang  up  at  the  same  moment  and  rushed

towards the philosopher to embrace him. He was just about to move off, and

had already turned sideways when we rushed up to him. The dog turned

sharply  round  and  barked,  thinking  doubtless,  like  the  philosopher's

companion, of an attempt at robbery rather than an enraptured embrace. It

was plain that he had forgotten us. In a word, he ran away. Our embrace was

a miserable failure when we did overtake him; for my friend gave a loud yell

as the dog bit him, and the philosopher himself sprang away from me with

such force that we both fell. What with the dog and the men there was a

scramble that lasted a few minutes, until my friend began to call out loudly,

parodying  the  philosopher's  own  words:  "In  the  name  of  all  culture  and

pseudo-culture,  what  does  the  silly  dog  want  with  us?  Hence,  you

confounded dog; you uninitiated, never to be initiated; hasten away from us,

silent and ashamed!" After this outburst matters were cleared up to some

extent, at any rate so far as they could be cleared up in the darkness of the

wood. "Oh, it's you!" ejaculated the philosopher, "our duellists! How you

startled us! What on earth drives you to jump out upon us like this at such a

time of the night?"

  "Joy, thankfulness, and reverence," said we, shaking the old man by the

hand, whilst the dog barked as if he understood, "we can't let you go without

telling you this. And if you are to understand everything you must not go

away just yet; we want to ask you about so many things that lie heavily on

our  hearts.  Stay  yet  awhile;  we  know  every  foot  of  the  way  and  can

accompany you afterwards. The gentleman you expect may yet turn up. Look

over yonder on the Rhine: what is that we see so clearly floating on the

surface of the water as if surrounded by the light of many torches? It is there

that we may look for your friend, I would even venture to say that it is he

who is coming towards you with all those lights."

  And so much did we assail the surprised old man with our entreaties,

promises, and fantastic delusions, that we persuaded the philosopher to walk

to and fro with us on the little plateau, "by learned lumber undisturbed," as

my friend added.

    "Shame  on  you!"  said  the  philosopher,  "if  you  really  want  to  quote

something, why choose Faust? However, I will give in to you, quotation orno quotation, if only our young companions will keep still and not run away

as suddenly as they made their appearance, for they are like will-o'-the-wisps;

we are amazed when they are there and again when they are not there."

  My friend immediately recited--

  Respect, I hope, will teach us how we may Our lighter disposition keep at

bay. Our course is only zig-zag as a rule.

  The philosopher was surprised, and stood still. "You astonish me, you

will-o'-the-wisps," he said; "this is no quagmire we are on now. Of what use

is this ground to you? What does the proximity of a philosopher mean to

you? For around him the air is sharp and clear, the ground dry and hard. You

must find out a more fantastic region for your zig-zagging inclinations."

  "I  think,"  interrupted  the  philosopher's  companion  at  this  point,  "the

gentlemen have already told us that they promised to meet some one here at

this hour; but it seems to me that they listened to our comedy of education

like a chorus, and truly 'idealistic spectators'--for they did not disturb us; we

thought we were alone with each other."

  "Yes, that is true," said the philosopher, "that praise must not be withheld

from them, but it seems to me that they deserve still higher praise----"

  Here  I  seized  the  philosopher's  hand  and  said:  "That  man  must  be  as

obtuse as a reptile, with his stomach on the ground and his head buried in

mud, who can listen to such a discourse as yours without becoming earnest

and thoughtful, or even excited and indignant. Self-accusation and annoyance

might  perhaps  cause  a  few  to  get  angry;  but  our  impression  was  quite

different: the only thing I do not know is how exactly to describe it. This hour

was so well-timed for us, and our minds were so well prepared, that we sat

there like empty vessels, and now it seems as if we were filled to overflowing

with this new wisdom: for I no longer know how to help myself, and if some

one asked me what I am thinking of doing to-morrow, or what I have made

up my mind to do with myself from now on, I should not know what to

answer. For it is easy to see that we have up to the present been living and

educating ourselves in the wrong way--but what can we do to cross over the

chasm between to-day and to-morrow?"

  "Yes," acknowledged my friend, "I have a similar feeling, and I ask the

same  question:  but  besides  that  I  feel  as  if  I  were  frightened  away  from

German culture by entertaining such high and ideal views of its task; yea, as

if I were unworthy to co-operate with it in carrying out its aims. I only see a

resplendent  file  of  the  highest  natures  moving  towards  this  goal;  I  canimagine  over  what  abysses  and  through  what  temptations  this  procession

travels. Who would dare to be so bold as to join in it?"

  At this point the philosopher's companion again turned to him and said:

"Don't be angry with me when I tell you that I too have a somewhat similar

feeling, which I have not mentioned to you before. When talking to you I

often felt drawn out of myself, as it were, and inspired with your ardour and

hopes till I almost forgot myself. Then a calmer moment arrives; a piercing

wind of reality brings me back to earth--and then I see the wide gulf between

us, over which you yourself, as in a dream, draw me back again. Then what

you call 'culture' merely totters meaninglessly around me or lies heavily on

my breast: it is like a shirt of mail that weighs me down, or a sword that I

cannot wield."

  Our minds, as we thus argued with the philosopher, were unanimous, and,

mutually encouraging and stimulating one another, we slowly walked with

him  backwards  and  forwards  along  the  unencumbered  space  which  had

earlier in the day served us as a shooting range. And then, in the still night,

under the peaceful light of hundreds of stars, we all broke out into a tirade

which ran somewhat as follows:--

  "You have told us so much about the genius," we began, "about his lonely

and  wearisome  journey  through  the  world,  as  if  nature  never  exhibited

anything but the most diametrical contraries: in one place the stupid, dull

masses, acting by instinct, and then, on a far higher and more remote plane,

the great contemplating few, destined for the production of immortal works.

But  now  you  call  these  the  apexes  of  the  intellectual  pyramid:  it  would,

however, seem that between the broad, heavily burdened foundation up to the

highest  of  the  free  and  unencumbered  peaks  there  must  be  countless

intermediate degrees, and that here we must apply the saying natura non facit

saltus. Where then are we to look for the beginning of what you call culture;

where is the line of demarcation to be drawn between the spheres which are

ruled  from  below  upwards  and  those  which  are  ruled  from  above

downwards? And if it be only in connection with these exalted beings that

true culture may be spoken of, how are institutions to be founded for the

uncertain  existence  of  such  natures,  how  can  we  devise  educational

establishments which shall be of benefit only to these select few? It rather

seems to us that such persons know how to find their own way, and that their

full strength is shown in their being able to walk without the educational

crutches necessary for other people, and thus undisturbed to make their waythrough the storm and stress of this rough world just like a phantom."

  We kept on arguing in this fashion, speaking without any great ability and

not putting our thoughts in any special form: but the philosopher's companion

went even further, and said to him: "Just think of all these great geniuses of

whom  we  are  wont  to  be  so  proud,  looking  upon  them  as  tried  and  true

leaders and guides of this real German spirit, whose names we commemorate

by statues and festivals, and whose works we hold up with feelings of pride

for the admiration of foreign lands--how did they obtain the education you

demand for them, to what degree do they show that they have been nourished

and matured by basking in the sun of national education? And yet they are

seen  to  be  possible,  they  have  nevertheless  become  men  whom  we  must

honour: yea, their works themselves justify the form of the development of

these noble spirits; they justify even a certain want of education for which we

must make allowance owing to their country and the age in which they lived.

How could Lessing and Winckelmann benefit by the German culture of their

time? Even less than, or at all events just as little as Beethoven, Schiller,

Goethe, or every one of our great poets and artists. It may perhaps be a law of

nature that only the later generations are destined to know by what divine

gifts an earlier generation was favoured."

  At this point the old philosopher could not control his anger, and shouted

to his companion: "Oh, you innocent lamb of knowledge! You gentle sucking

doves,  all  of  you!  And  would  you  give  the  name  of  arguments  to  those

distorted, clumsy, narrow-minded, ungainly, crippled things? Yes, I have just

now been listening to the fruits of some of this present-day culture, and my

ears are still ringing with the sound of historical 'self-understood' things, of

over-wise  and  pitiless  historical  reasonings!  Mark  this,  thou  unprofaned

Nature: thou hast grown old, and for thousands of years this starry sky has

spanned the space above thee--but thou hast never yet heard such conceited

and, at bottom, mischievous chatter as the talk of the present day! So you are

proud of your poets and artists, my good Teutons? You point to them and

brag about them to foreign countries, do you? And because it has given you

no trouble to have them amongst you, you have formed the pleasant theory

that you need not concern yourselves further with them? Isn't that so, my

inexperienced children: they come of their own free will, the stork brings

them to you! Who would dare to mention a midwife! You deserve an earnest

teaching, eh? You should be proud of the fact that all the noble and brilliant

men we have mentioned were prematurely suffocated, worn out, and crushedthrough you, through your barbarism? You think without shame of Lessing,

who, on account of your stupidity, perished in battle against your ludicrous

gods  and  idols,  the  evils  of  your  theatres,  your  learned  men,  and  your

theologians, without once daring to lift himself to the height of that immortal

flight  for  which  he  was  brought  into  the  world.  And  what  are  your

impressions when you think of Winckelmann, who, that he might rid his eyes

of your grotesque fatuousness, went to beg help from the Jesuits, and whose

disgraceful religious conversion recoils upon you and will always remain an

ineffaceable  blemish  upon  you?  You  can  even  name  Schiller  without

blushing! Just look at his picture! The fiery, sparkling eyes, looking at you

with disdain, those flushed, death-like cheeks: can you learn nothing from all

that? In him you had a beautiful and divine plaything, and through it was

destroyed. And if it had been possible for you to take Goethe's friendship

away from this melancholy, hasty life, hunted to premature death, then you

would have crushed him even sooner than you did. You have not rendered

assistance to a single one of our great geniuses--and now upon that fact you

wish to build up the theory that none of them shall ever be helped in future?

For each of them, however, up to this very moment, you have always been

the 'resistance of the stupid world' that Goethe speaks of in his "Epilogue to

the Bell"; towards each of them you acted the part of apathetic dullards or

jealous narrow-hearts or malignant egotists. In spite of you they created their

immortal works, against you they directed their attacks, and thanks to you

they died so prematurely, their tasks only half accomplished, blunted and

dulled and shattered in the battle. Who can tell to what these heroic men were

destined to attain if only that true German spirit had gathered them together

within  the  protecting  walls  of  a  powerful  institution?--that  spirit  which,

without the help of some such institution, drags out an isolated, debased, and

degraded existence. All those great men were utterly ruined; and it is only an

insane belief in the Hegelian 'reasonableness of all happenings' which would

absolve you of any responsibility in the matter. And not those men alone!

Indictments are pouring forth against you from every intellectual province:

whether I look at the talents of our poets, philosophers, painters, or sculptors-

-and  not  only  in  the  case  of  gifts  of  the  highest  order--I  everywhere  see

immaturity, overstrained nerves, or prematurely exhausted energies, abilities

wasted and nipped in the bud; I everywhere feel that 'resistance of the stupid

world,' in other words, your guiltiness. That is what I am talking about when I

speak of lacking educational establishments, and why I think those which atpresent claim the name in such a pitiful condition. Whoever is pleased to call

this an 'ideal desire,' and refers to it as 'ideal' as if he were trying to get rid of

it by praising me, deserves the answer that the present system is a scandal and

a disgrace, and that the man who asks for warmth in the midst of ice and

snow must indeed get angry if he hears this referred to as an 'ideal desire.'

The  matter  we  are  now  discussing  is  concerned  with  clear,  urgent,  and

palpably evident realities: a man who knows anything of the question feels

that there is a need which must be seen to, just like cold and hunger. But the

man who is not affected at all by this matter most certainly has a standard by

which to measure the extent of his own culture, and thus to know what I call

'culture,' and where the line should be drawn between that which is ruled

from below upwards and that which is ruled from above downwards."

  The philosopher seemed to be speaking very heatedly. We begged him to

walk round with us again, since he had uttered the latter part of his discourse

standing  near  the  tree-stump  which  had  served  us  as  a  target.  For  a  few

minutes not a word more was spoken. Slowly and thoughtfully we walked to

and fro. We did not so much feel ashamed of having brought forward such

foolish arguments as we felt a kind of restitution of our personality. After the

heated and, so far as we were concerned, very unflattering utterance of the

philosopher, we seemed to feel ourselves nearer to him--that we even stood in

a personal relationship to him. For so wretched is man that he never feels

himself brought into such close contact with a stranger as when the latter

shows some sign of weakness, some defect. That our philosopher had lost his

temper and made use of abusive language helped to bridge over the gulf

created between us by our timid respect for him: and for the sake of the

reader who feels his indignation rising at this suggestion let it be added that

this bridge often leads from distant hero-worship to personal love and pity.

And, after the feeling that our personality had been restored to us, this pity

gradually became stronger and stronger. Why were we making this old man

walk up and down with us between the rocks and trees at that time of the

night? And, since he had yielded to our entreaties, why could we not have

thought  of  a  more  modest  and  unassuming  manner  of  having  ourselves

instructed, why should the three of us have contradicted him in such clumsy

terms?

  For now we saw how thoughtless, unprepared, and baseless were all the

objections we had made, and how greatly the echo of the present was heard in

them, the voice of which, in the province of culture, the old man would fainnot have heard. Our objections, however, were not purely intellectual ones:

our reasons for protesting against the philosopher's statements seemed to lie

elsewhere. They arose perhaps from the instinctive anxiety to know whether,

if  the  philosopher's  views  were  carried  into  effect,  our  own  personalities

would find a place in the higher or lower division; and this made it necessary

for us to find some arguments against the mode of thinking which robbed us

of our self-styled claims to culture. People, however, should not argue with

companions who feel the weight of an argument so personally; or, as the

moral  in  our  case  would  have  been:  such  companions  should  not  argue,

should not contradict at all.

  So  we  walked  on  beside  the  philosopher,  ashamed,  compassionate,

dissatisfied with ourselves, and more than ever convinced that the old man

was right and that we had done him wrong. How remote now seemed the

youthful dream of our educational institution; how clearly we saw the danger

which  we  had  hitherto  escaped  merely  by  good  luck,  namely,  giving

ourselves up body and soul to the educational system which forced itself

upon our notice so enticingly, from the time when we entered the public

schools up to that moment. How then had it come about that we had not taken

our places in the chorus of its admirers? Perhaps merely because we were real

students, and could still draw back from the rough-and-tumble, the pushing

and struggling, the restless, ever-breaking waves of publicity, to seek refuge

in our own little educational establishment; which, however, time would have

soon swallowed up also.

  Overcome by such reflections, we were about to address the philosopher

again, when he suddenly turned towards us, and said in a softer tone--

  "I cannot be surprised if you young men behave rashly and thoughtlessly;

for it is hardly likely that you have ever seriously considered what I have just

said to you. Don't be in a hurry; carry this question about with you, but do at

any rate consider it day and night. For you are now at the parting of the ways,

and now you know where each path leads. If you take the one, your age will

receive you with open arms, you will not find it wanting in honours and

decorations: you will form units of an enormous rank and file; and there will

be as many people like-minded standing behind you as in front of you. And

when the leader gives the word it will be re-echoed from rank to rank. For

here your first duty is this: to fight in rank and file; and your second: to

annihilate all those who refuse to form part of the rank and file. On the other

path you will have but few fellow-travellers: it is more arduous, winding andprecipitous;  and  those  who  take  the  first  path  will  mock  you,  for  your

progress is more wearisome, and they will try to lure you over into their own

ranks. When the two paths happen to cross, however, you will be roughly

handled and thrust aside, or else shunned and isolated.

  "Now,  take  these  two  parties,  so  different  from  each  other  in  every

respect, and tell me what meaning an educational establishment would have

for them. That enormous horde, crowding onwards on the first path towards

its goal, would take the term to mean an institution by which each of its

members would become duly qualified to take his place in the rank and file,

and would be purged of everything which might tend to make him strive after

higher and more remote aims. I don't deny, of course, that they can find

pompous words with which to describe their aims: for example, they speak of

the 'universal development of free personality upon a firm social, national,

and  human  basis,'  or  they  announce  as  their  goal:  'The  founding  of  the

peaceful sovereignty of the people upon reason, education, and justice.'

  "An  educational  establishment  for  the  other  and  smaller  company,

however,  would  be  something  vastly  different.  They  would  employ  it  to

prevent themselves from being separated from one another and overwhelmed

by the first huge crowd, to prevent their few select spirits from losing sight of

their splendid and noble task through premature weariness, or from being

turned aside from the true path, corrupted, or subverted. These select spirits

must  complete  their  work:  that  is  the  raison  d'�tre  of  their  common

institution--a work, indeed, which, as it were, must be free from subjective

traces, and must further rise above the transient events of future times as the

pure reflection of the eternal and immutable essence of things. And all those

who occupy places in that institution must co-operate in the endeavour to

engender  men  of  genius  by  this  purification  from  subjectiveness  and  the

creation of the works of genius. Not a few, even of those whose talents may

be of the second or third order, are suited to such co-operation, and only

when serving in such an educational establishment as this do they feel that

they are truly carrying out their life's task. But now it is just these talents I

speak  of  which  are  drawn  away  from  the  true  path,  and  their  instincts

estranged, by the continual seductions of that modern 'culture.'

  "The  egotistic  emotions,  weaknesses,  and  vanities  of  these  few  select

minds are continually assailed by the temptations unceasingly murmured into

their ears by the spirit of the age: 'Come with me! There you are servants,

retainers, tools, eclipsed by higher natures; your own peculiar characteristicsnever have free play; you are tied down, chained down, like slaves; yea, like

automata:  here,  with  me,  you  will  enjoy  the  freedom  of  your  own

personalities,  as  masters  should,  your  talents  will  cast  their  lustre  on

yourselves alone, with their aid you may come to the very front rank; an

innumerable  train  of  followers  will  accompany  you,  and  the  applause  of

public  opinion  will  yield  you  more  pleasure  than  a  nobly-bestowed

commendation from the height of genius.' Even the very best of men now

yield to these temptations: and it cannot be said that the deciding factor here

is the degree of talent, or whether a man is accessible to these voices or not;

but rather the degree and the height of a certain moral sublimity, the instinct

towards heroism, towards sacrifice--and finally a positive, habitual need of

culture, prepared by a proper kind of education, which education, as I have

previously  said,  is  first  and  foremost  obedience  and  submission  to  the

discipline of genius. Of this discipline and submission, however, the present

institutions  called  by  courtesy  'educational  establishments'  know  nothing

whatever,  although  I  have  no  doubt  that  the  public  school  was  originally

intended to be an institution for sowing the seeds of true culture, or at least as

a preparation for it. I have no doubt, either, that they took the first bold steps

in the wonderful and stirring times of the Reformation, and that afterwards, in

the era which gave birth to Schiller and Goethe, there was again a growing

demand for culture, like the first protuberance of that wing spoken of by

Plato in the Phaedrus, which, at every contact with the beautiful, bears the

soul aloft into the upper regions, the habitations of the gods."

  "Ah," began the philosopher's companion, "when you quote the divine

Plato and the world of ideas, I do not think you are angry with me, however

much my previous utterance may have merited your disapproval and wrath.

As soon as you speak of it, I feel that Platonic wing rising within me; and it is

only at intervals, when I act as the charioteer of my soul, that I have any

difficulty with the resisting and unwilling horse that Plato has also described

to us, the 'crooked, lumbering animal, put together anyhow, with a short,

thick neck; flat-faced, and of a dark colour, with grey eyes and blood-red

complexion; the mate of insolence and pride, shag-eared and deaf, hardly

yielding to whip or spur.'[8] Just think how long I have lived at a distance

from you, and how all those temptations you speak of have endeavoured to

lure me away, not perhaps without some success, even though I myself may

not have observed it. I now see more clearly than ever the necessity for an

institution which will enable us to live and mix freely with the few men oftrue culture, so that we may have them as our leaders and guiding stars. How

greatly I feel the danger of travelling alone! And when it occurred to me that

I could save myself by flight from all contact with the spirit of the time, I

found that this flight itself was a mere delusion. Continuously, with every

breath we take, some amount of that atmosphere circulates through every

vein and artery, and no solitude is lonesome or distant enough for us to be out

of reach of its fogs and clouds. Whether in the guise of hope, doubt, profit, or

virtue, the shades of that culture hover about us; and we have been deceived

by that jugglery even here in the presence of a true hermit of culture. How

steadfastly and faithfully must the few followers of that culture--which might

almost be called sectarian--be ever on the alert! How they must strengthen

and uphold one another! How adversely would any errors be criticised here,

and how sympathetically excused! And thus, teacher, I ask you to pardon me,

after you have laboured so earnestly to set me in the right path!"

  "You  use  a  language  which  I  do  not  care  for,  my  friend,"  said  the

philosopher, "and one which reminds me of a diocesan conference. With that

I have nothing to do. But your Platonic horse pleases me, and on its account

you shall be forgiven. I am willing to exchange my own animal for yours.

But it is getting chilly, and I don't feel inclined to walk about any more just

now. The friend I was waiting for is indeed foolish enough to come up here

even at midnight if he promised to do so. But I have waited in vain for the

signal agreed upon; and I cannot guess what has delayed him. For as a rule he

is punctual, as we old men are wont, to be, something that you young men

nowadays look upon as old-fashioned. But he has left me in the lurch for

once: how annoying it is! Come away with me! It's time to go!"

  At this moment something happened.

    (Delivered on the 23rd of March 1872.)

  LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN,--If  you  have  lent  a  sympathetic  ear  to

what I have told you about the heated argument of our philosopher in the

stillness of that memorable night, you must have felt as disappointed as we

did when he announced his peevish intention. You will remember that he hadsuddenly told us he wished to go; for, having been left in the lurch by his

friend in the first place, and, in the second, having been bored rather than

animated by the remarks addressed to him by his companion and ourselves

when walking backwards and forwards on the hillside, he now apparently

wanted to put an end to what appeared to him to be a useless discussion. It

must have seemed to him that his day had been lost, and he would have liked

to blot it out of his memory, together with the recollection of ever having

made our acquaintance. And we were thus rather unwillingly preparing to

depart when something else suddenly brought him to a standstill, and the foot

he had just raised sank hesitatingly to the ground again.

  A coloured flame, making a crackling noise for a few seconds, attracted

our  attention  from  the  direction  of  the  Rhine;  and  immediately  following

upon this we heard a slow, harmonious call, quite in tune, although plainly

the  cry  of  numerous  youthful  voices.  "That's  his  signal,"  exclaimed  the

philosopher, "so my friend is really coming, and I haven't waited for nothing,

after all. It will be a midnight meeting indeed--but how am I to let him know

that I am still here? Come! Your pistols; let us see your talent once again!

Did you hear the severe rhythm of that melody saluting us? Mark it well, and

answer it in the same rhythm by a series of shots."

  This was a task well suited to our tastes and abilities; so we loaded up as

quickly as we could and pointed our weapons at the brilliant stars in the

heavens, whilst the echo of that piercing cry died away in the distance. The

reports of the first, second, and third shots sounded sharply in the stillness;

and then the philosopher cried "False time!" as our rhythm was suddenly

interrupted: for, like a lightning flash, a shooting star tore its way across the

clouds after the third report, and almost involuntarily our fourth and fifth

shots were sent after it in the direction it had taken.

  "False time!" said the philosopher again, "who told you to shoot stars!

They can fall well enough without you! People should know what they want

before they begin to handle weapons."

  And then we once more heard that loud melody from the waters of the

Rhine, intoned by numerous and strong voices. "They understand us," said

the philosopher, laughing, "and who indeed could resist when such a dazzling

phantom comes within range?" "Hush!" interrupted his friend, "what sort of a

company can it be that returns the signal to us in such a way? I should say

they were between twenty and forty strong, manly voices in that crowd--and

where would such a number come from to greet us? They don't appear tohave left the opposite bank of the Rhine yet; but at any rate we must have a

look at them from our own side of the river. Come along, quickly!"

  We were then standing near the top of the hill, you may remember, and

our view of the river was interrupted by a dark, thick wood. On the other

hand, as I have told you, from the quiet little spot which we had left we could

have a better view than from the little plateau on the hillside; and the Rhine,

with  the  island  of  Nonnenw�rth  in  the  middle,  was  just  visible  to  the

beholder who peered over the tree-tops. We therefore set off hastily towards

this  little  spot,  taking  care,  however,  not  to  go  too  quickly  for  the

philosopher's comfort. The night was pitch dark, and we seemed to find our

way by instinct rather than by clearly distinguishing the path, as we walked

down with the philosopher in the middle.

  We had scarcely reached our side of the river when a broad and fiery, yet

dull and uncertain light shot up, which plainly came from the opposite side of

the Rhine. "Those are torches," I cried, "there is nothing surer than that my

comrades from Bonn are over yonder, and that your friend must be with

them.  It  is  they  who  sang  that  peculiar  song,  and  they  have  doubtless

accompanied  your  friend  here.  See!  Listen!  They  are  putting  off  in  little

boats. The whole torchlight procession will have arrived here in less than half

an hour."

  The philosopher jumped back. "What do you say?" he ejaculated, "your

comrades  from  Bonn--students--can  my  friend  have  come  here  with

students?"

  This  question,  uttered  almost  wrathfully,  provoked  us.  "What's  your

objection to students?" we demanded; but there was no answer. It was only

after a pause that the philosopher slowly began to speak, not addressing us

directly, as it were, but rather some one in the distance: "So, my friend, even

at midnight, even on the top of a lonely mountain, we shall not be alone; and

you yourself are bringing a pack of mischief-making students along with you,

although you well know that I am only too glad to get out of the way of hoc

genus omne. I don't quite understand you, my friend: it must mean something

when we arrange to meet after a long separation at such an out-of-the-way

place  and  at  such  an  unusual  hour.  Why  should  we  want  a  crowd  of

witnesses--and such witnesses! What calls us together to-day is least of all a

sentimental, soft-hearted necessity; for both of us learnt early in life to live

alone in dignified isolation. It was not for our own sakes, not to show our

tender  feelings  towards  each  other,  or  to  perform  an  unrehearsed  act  offriendship, that we decided to meet here; but that here, where I once came

suddenly  upon  you  as  you  sat  in  majestic  solitude,  we  might  earnestly

deliberate with each other like knights of a new order. Let them listen to us

who  can  understand  us;  but  why  should  you  bring  with  you  a  throng  of

people who don't understand us! I don't know what you mean by such a thing,

my friend!"

  We did not think it proper to interrupt the dissatisfied old grumbler; and

as he came to a melancholy close we did not dare to tell him how greatly this

distrustful repudiation of students vexed us.

  At  last  the  philosopher's  companion  turned  to  him  and  said:  "I  am

reminded  of  the  fact  that  even  you  at  one  time,  before  I  made  your

acquaintance,  occupied  posts  in  several  universities,  and  that  reports

concerning  your  intercourse  with  the  students  and  your  methods  of

instruction at the time are still in circulation. From the tone of resignation in

which you have just referred to students many would be inclined to think that

you had some peculiar experiences which were not at all to your liking; but

personally I rather believe that you saw and experienced in such places just

what every one else saw and experienced in them, but that you judged what

you saw and felt more justly and severely than any one else. For, during the

time I have known you, I have learnt that the most noteworthy, instructive,

and decisive experiences and events in one's life are those which are of daily

occurrence; that the greatest riddle, displayed in full view of all, is seen by

the fewest to be the greatest riddle, and that these problems are spread about

in every direction, under the very feet of the passers-by, for the few real

philosophers to lift up carefully, thenceforth to shine as diamonds of wisdom.

Perhaps, in the short time now left us before the arrival of your friend, you

will be good enough to tell us something of your experiences of university

life, so as to close the circle of observations, to which we were involuntarily

urged, respecting our educational institutions. We may also be allowed to

remind you that you, at an earlier stage of your remarks, gave me the promise

that you would do so. Starting with the public school, you claimed for it an

extraordinary  importance:  all  other  institutions  must  be  judged  by  its

standard, according as its aim has been proposed; and, if its aim happens to

be wrong, all the others have to suffer. Such an importance cannot now be

adopted  by  the  universities  as  a  standard;  for,  by  their  present  system  of

grouping, they would be nothing more than institutions where public school

students  might  go  through  finishing  courses.  You  promised  me  that  youwould explain this in greater detail later on: perhaps our student friends can

bear  witness  to  that,  if  they  chanced  to  overhear  that  part  of  our

conversation."

  "We can testify to that," I put in. The philosopher then turned to us and

said: "Well, if you really did listen attentively, perhaps you can now tell me

what  you  understand  by  the  expression  'the  present  aim  of  our  public

schools.'  Besides,  you  are  still  near  enough  to  this  sphere  to  judge  my

opinions by the standard of your own impressions and experiences."

  My friend instantly answered, quickly and smartly, as was his habit, in

the following words: "Until now we had always thought that the sole object

of  the  public  school  was  to  prepare  students  for  the  universities.  This

preparation, however, should tend to make us independent enough for the

extraordinarily free position of a university student;[9] for it seems to me that

a student, to a greater extent than any other individual, has more to decide

and settle for himself. He must guide himself on a wide, utterly unknown

path for many years, so the public school must do its best to render him

independent."

  I continued the argument where my friend left off. "It even seems to me,"

I said, "that everything for which you have justly blamed the public school is

only a necessary means employed to imbue the youthful student with some

kind of independence, or at all events with the belief that there is such a

thing. The teaching of German composition must be at the service of this

independence:  the  individual  must  enjoy  his  opinions  and  carry  out  his

designs early, so that he may be able to travel alone and without crutches. In

this  way  he  will  soon  be  encouraged  to  produce  original  work,  and  still

sooner to take up criticism and analysis. If Latin and Greek studies prove

insufficient  to  make  a  student  an  enthusiastic  admirer  of  antiquity,  the

methods with which such studies are pursued are at all events sufficient to

awaken  the  scientific  sense,  the  desire  for  a  more  strict  causality  of

knowledge, the passion for finding out and inventing. Only think how many

young men may be lured away for ever to the attractions of science by a new

reading of some sort which they have snatched up with youthful hands at the

public school! The public school boy must learn and collect a great deal of

varied information: hence an impulse will gradually be created, accompanied

with  which  he  will  continue  to  learn  and  collect  independently  at  the

university. We believe, in short, that the aim of the public school is to prepare

and accustom the student always to live and learn independently afterwards,just as beforehand he must live and learn dependently at the public school."

  The philosopher laughed, not altogether good-naturedly, and said: "You

have just given me a fine example of that independence. And it is this very

independence  that  shocks  me  so  much,  and  makes  any  place  in  the

neighbourhood of present-day students so disagreeable to me. Yes, my good

friends, you are perfect, you are mature; nature has cast you and broken up

the  moulds,  and  your  teachers  must  surely  gloat  over  you.  What  liberty,

certitude,  and  independence  of  judgment;  what  novelty  and  freshness  of

insight!  You  sit  in  judgment--and  the  cultures  of  all  ages  run  away.  The

scientific sense is kindled, and rises out of you like a flame--let people be

careful, lest you set them alight! If I go further into the question and look at

your professors, I again find the same independence in a greater and even

more charming degree: never was there a time so full of the most sublime

independent folk, never was slavery more detested, the slavery of education

and culture included.

  "Permit  me,  however,  to  measure  this  independence  of  yours  by  the

standard of this culture, and to consider your university as an educational

institution and nothing else. If a foreigner desires to know something of the

methods of our universities, he asks first of all with emphasis: 'How is the

student connected with the university?' We answer: 'By the ear, as a hearer.'

The foreigner is astonished. 'Only by the ear?' he repeats. 'Only by the ear,'

we again reply. The student hears. When he speaks, when he sees, when he is

in the company of his companions when he takes up some branch of art: in

short,  when  he  lives  he  is  independent,  i.e.  not  dependent  upon  the

educational institution. The student very often writes down something while

he hears; and it is only at these rare moments that he hangs to the umbilical

cord of his alma mater. He himself may choose what he is to listen to; he is

not bound to believe what is said; he may close his ears if he does not care to

hear. This is the 'acroamatic' method of teaching.

  "The teacher, however, speaks to these listening students. Whatever else

he may think and do is cut off from the student's perception by an immense

gap. The professor often reads when he is speaking. As a rule he wishes to

have as many hearers as possible; he is not content to have a few, and he is

never satisfied with one only. One speaking mouth, with many ears, and half

as  many  writing  hands--there  you  have  to  all  appearances,  the  external

academical  apparatus;  the  university  engine  of  culture  set  in  motion.

Moreover, the proprietor of this one mouth is severed from and independentof  the  owners  of  the  many  ears;  and  this  double  independence  is

enthusiastically  designated  as  'academical  freedom.'  And  again,  that  this

freedom may be broadened still more, the one may speak what he likes and

the other may hear what he likes; except that, behind both of them, at a

modest distance, stands the State, with all the intentness of a supervisor, to

remind the professors and students from time to time that it is the aim, the

goal, the be-all and end-all, of this curious speaking and hearing procedure.

  "We, who must be permitted to regard this phenomenon merely as an

educational institution, will then inform the inquiring foreigner that what is

called 'culture' in our universities merely proceeds from the mouth to the ear,

and  that  every  kind  of  training  for  culture  is,  as  I  said  before,  merely

'acroamatic.' Since, however, not only the hearing, but also the choice of what

to  hear  is  left  to  the  independent  decision  of  the  liberal-minded  and

unprejudiced  student,  and  since,  again,  he  can  withhold  all  belief  and

authority from what he hears, all training for culture, in the true sense of the

term, reverts to himself; and the independence it was thought desirable to aim

at in the public school now presents itself with the highest possible pride as

'academical self-training for culture,' and struts about in its brilliant plumage.

  "Happy  times,  when  youths  are  clever  and  cultured  enough  to  teach

themselves how to walk! Unsurpassable public schools, which succeed in

implanting  independence  in  the  place  of  the  dependence,  discipline,

subordination, and obedience implanted by former generations that thought it

their  duty  to  drive  away  all  the  bumptiousness  of  independence!  Do  you

clearly see, my good friends, why I, from the standpoint of culture, regard the

present type of university as a mere appendage to the public school? The

culture  instilled  by  the  public  school  passes  through  the  gates  of  the

university as something ready and entire, and with its own particular claims:

it demands, it gives laws, it sits in judgment. Do not, then, let yourselves be

deceived in regard to the cultured student; for he, in so far as he thinks he has

absorbed  the  blessings  of  education,  is  merely  the  public  school  boy  as

moulded by the hands of his teacher: one who, since his academical isolation,

and after he has left the public school, has therefore been deprived of all

further guidance to culture, that from now on he may begin to live by himself

and be free.

  "Free!  Examine  this  freedom,  ye  observers  of  human  nature!  Erected

upon the sandy, crumbling foundation of our present public school culture, its

building slants to one side, trembling before the whirlwind's blast. Look atthe  free  student,  the  herald  of  self-culture:  guess  what  his  instincts  are;

explain him from his needs! How does his culture appear to you when you

measure  it  by  three  graduated  scales:  first,  by  his  need  for  philosophy;

second, by his instinct for art; and third, by Greek and Roman antiquity as the

incarnate categorical imperative of all culture?

  "Man is so much encompassed about by the most serious and difficult

problems that, when they are brought to his attention in the right way, he is

impelled betimes towards a lasting kind of philosophical wonder, from which

alone, as a fruitful soil, a deep and noble culture can grow forth. His own

experiences lead him most frequently to the consideration of these problems;

and it is especially in the tempestuous period of youth that every personal

event shines with a double gleam, both as the exemplification of a triviality

and,  at  the  same  time,  of  an  eternally  surprising  problem,  deserving  of

explanation. At this age, which, as it were, sees his experiences encircled

with  metaphysical  rainbows,  man  is,  in  the  highest  degree,  in  need  of  a

guiding hand, because he has suddenly and almost instinctively convinced

himself of the ambiguity of existence, and has lost the firm support of the

beliefs he has hitherto held.

  "This natural state of great need must of course be looked upon as the

worst enemy of that beloved independence for which the cultured youth of

the present day should be trained. All these sons of the present, who have

raised the banner of the 'self-understood,' are therefore straining every nerve

to crush down these feelings of youth, to cripple them, to mislead them, or to

stop their growth altogether; and the favourite means employed is to paralyse

that natural philosophic impulse by the so-called "historical culture." A still

recent  system,[10]  which  has  won  for  itself  a  world-wide  scandalous

reputation, has discovered the formula for this self-destruction of philosophy;

and now, wherever the historical view of things is found, we can see such a

naive recklessness in bringing the irrational to 'rationality' and 'reason' and

making black look like white, that one is even inclined to parody Hegel's

phrase and ask: 'Is all this irrationality real?' Ah, it is only the irrational that

now seems to be 'real,' i.e. really doing something; and to bring this kind of

reality forward for the elucidation of history is reckoned as true 'historical

culture.' It is into this that the philosophical impulse of our time has pupated

itself;  and  the  peculiar  philosophers  of  our  universities  seem  to  have

conspired to fortify and confirm the young academicians in it.

  "It has thus come to pass that, in place of a profound interpretation of theeternally recurring problems, a historical--yea, even philological--balancing

and  questioning  has  entered  into  the  educational  arena:  what  this  or  that

philosopher has or has not thought; whether this or that essay or dialogue is

to be ascribed to him or not; or even whether this particular reading of a

classical text is to be preferred to that. It is to neutral preoccupations with

philosophy  like  these  that  our  students  in  philosophical  seminaries  are

stimulated; whence I have long accustomed myself to regard such science as

a  mere  ramification  of  philology,  and  to  value  its  representatives  in

proportion as they are good or bad philologists. So it has come about that

philosophy  itself  is  banished  from  the  universities:  wherewith  our  first

question as to the value of our universities from the standpoint of culture is

answered.

  "In  what  relationship  these  universities  stand  to  art  cannot  be

acknowledged without shame: in none at all. Of artistic thinking, learning,

striving, and comparison, we do not find in them a single trace; and no one

would seriously think that the voice of the universities would ever be raised

to help the advancement of the higher national schemes of art. Whether an

individual teacher feels himself to be personally qualified for art, or whether

a professorial chair has been established for the training of �stheticising

literary historians, does not enter into the question at all: the fact remains that

the university is not in a position to control the young academician by severe

artistic discipline, and that it must let happen what happens, willy-nilly--and

this is the cutting answer to the immodest pretensions of the universities to

represent themselves as the highest educational institutions.

  "We find our academical 'independents' growing up without philosophy

and without art; and how can they then have any need to 'go in for' the Greeks

and Romans?--for we need now no longer pretend, like our forefathers, to

have any great regard for Greece and Rome, which, besides, sit enthroned in

almost inaccessible loneliness and majestic alienation. The universities of the

present  time  consequently  give  no  heed  to  almost  extinct  educational

predilections like these, and found their philological chairs for the training of

new and exclusive generations of philologists, who on their part give similar

philological preparation in the public schools--a vicious circle which is useful

neither to philologists nor to public schools, but which above all accuses the

university for the third time of not being what it so pompously proclaims

itself to be--a training ground for culture. Take away the Greeks, together

with philosophy and art, and what ladder have you still remaining by whichto ascend to culture? For, if you attempt to clamber up the ladder without

these helps, you must permit me to inform you that all your learning will lie

like a heavy burden on your shoulders rather than furnishing you with wings

and bearing you aloft.

  "If you honest thinkers have honourably remained in these three stages of

intelligence,  and  have  perceived  that,  in  comparison  with  the  Greeks,  the

modern student is unsuited to and unprepared for philosophy, that he has no

truly artistic instincts, and is merely a barbarian believing himself to be free,

you will not on this account turn away from him in disgust, although you

will, of course, avoid coming into too close proximity with him. For, as he

now is, he is not to blame: as you have perceived him he is the dumb but

terrible accuser of those who are to blame.

  "You  should  understand  the  secret  language  spoken  by  this  guilty

innocent, and then you, too, would learn to understand the inward state of

that independence which is paraded outwardly with so much ostentation. Not

one  of  these  noble,  well-qualified  youths  has  remained  a  stranger  to  that

restless,  tiring,  perplexing,  and  debilitating  need  of  culture:  during  his

university  term,  when  he  is  apparently  the  only  free  man  in  a  crowd  of

servants and officials, he atones for this huge illusion of freedom by ever-

growing inner doubts and convictions. He feels that he can neither lead nor

help himself; and then he plunges hopelessly into the workaday world and

endeavours to ward off such feelings by study. The most trivial bustle fastens

itself upon him; he sinks under his heavy burden. Then he suddenly pulls

himself together; he still feels some of that power within him which would

have enabled him to keep his head above water. Pride and noble resolutions

assert themselves and grow in him. He is afraid of sinking at this early stage

into  the  limits  of  a  narrow  profession;  and  now  he  grasps  at  pillars  and

railings alongside the stream that he may not be swept away by the current. In

vain! for these supports give way, and he finds he has clutched at broken

reeds. In low and despondent spirits he sees his plans vanish away in smoke.

His  condition  is  undignified,  even  dreadful:  he  keeps  between  the  two

extremes of work at high pressure and a state of melancholy enervation. Then

he becomes tired, lazy, afraid of work, fearful of everything great; and hating

himself. He looks into his own breast, analyses his faculties, and finds he is

only peering into hollow and chaotic vacuity. And then he once more falls

from  the  heights  of  his  eagerly-desired  self-knowledge  into  an  ironical

scepticism. He divests his struggles of their real importance, and feels himselfready to undertake any class of useful work, however degrading. He now

seeks consolation in hasty and incessant action so as to hide himself from

himself. And thus his helplessness and the want of a leader towards culture

drive him from one form of life into another: but doubt, elevation, worry,

hope, despair--everything flings him hither and thither as a proof that all the

stars above him by which he could have guided his ship have set.

  "There you have the picture of this glorious independence of yours, of

that  academical  freedom,  reflected  in  the  highest  minds--those  which  are

truly in need of culture, compared with whom that other crowd of indifferent

natures does not count at all, natures that delight in their freedom in a purely

barbaric sense. For these latter show by their base smugness and their narrow

professional limitations that this is the right element for them: against which

there is nothing to be said. Their comfort, however, does not counter-balance

the suffering of one single young man who has an inclination for culture and

feels the need of a guiding hand, and who at last, in a moment of discontent,

throws down the reins and begins to despise himself. This is the guiltless

innocent; for who has saddled him with the unbearable burden of standing

alone? Who has urged him on to independence at an age when one of the

most  natural  and  peremptory  needs  of  youth  is,  so  to  speak,  a  self-

surrendering to great leaders and an enthusiastic following in the footsteps of

the masters?

  "It is repulsive to consider the effects to which the violent suppression of

such noble natures may lead. He who surveys the greatest supporters and

friends of that pseudo-culture of the present time, which I so greatly detest,

will only too frequently find among them such degenerate and shipwrecked

men of culture, driven by inward despair to violent enmity against culture,

when, in a moment of desperation, there was no one at hand to show them

how to attain it. It is not the worst and most insignificant people whom we

afterwards  find  acting  as  journalists  and  writers  for  the  press  in  the

metamorphosis of despair: the spirit of some well-known men of letters might

even  be  described,  and  justly,  as  degenerate  studentdom.  How  else,  for

example, can we reconcile that once well-known 'young Germany' with its

present degenerate successors? Here we discover a need of culture which, so

to  speak,  has  grown  mutinous,  and  which  finally  breaks  out  into  the

passionate cry: I am culture! There, before the gates of the public schools and

universities, we can see the culture which has been driven like a fugitive

away from these institutions. True, this culture is without the erudition ofthose establishments, but assumes nevertheless the mien of a sovereign; so

that,  for  example,  Gutzkow  the  novelist  might  be  pointed  to  as  the  best

example of a modern public school boy turned �sthete. Such a degenerate

man of culture is a serious matter, and it is a horrifying spectacle for us to see

that  all  our  scholarly  and  journalistic  publicity  bears  the  stigma  of  this

degeneracy upon it. How else can we do justice to our learned men, who pay

untiring attention to, and even co-operate in the journalistic corruption of the

people, how else than by the acknowledgment that their learning must fill a

want of their own similar to that filled by novel-writing in the case of others:

i.e. a flight from one's self, an ascetic extirpation of their cultural impulses, a

desperate attempt to annihilate their own individuality. From our degenerate

literary art, as also from that itch for scribbling of our learned men which has

now reached such alarming proportions, wells forth the same sigh: Oh that

we could forget ourselves! The attempt fails: memory, not yet suffocated by

the mountains of printed paper under which it is buried, keeps on repeating

from time to time: 'A degenerate man of culture! Born for culture and brought

up to non-culture! Helpless barbarian, slave of the day, chained to the present

moment, and thirsting for something--ever thirsting!'

  "Oh, the miserable guilty innocents! For they lack something, a need that

every one of them must have felt: a real educational institution, which could

give them goals, masters, methods, companions; and from the midst of which

the invigorating and uplifting breath of the true German spirit would inspire

them. Thus they perish in the wilderness; thus they degenerate into enemies

of that spirit which is at bottom closely allied to their own; thus they pile fault

upon  fault  higher  than  any  former  generation  ever  did,  soiling  the  clean,

desecrating the holy, canonising the false and spurious. It is by them that you

can judge the educational strength of our universities, asking yourselves, in

all seriousness, the question: What cause did you promote through them? The

German  power  of  invention,  the  noble  German  desire  for  knowledge,  the

qualifying  of  the  German  for  diligence  and  self-sacrifice--splendid  and

beautiful  things,  which  other  nations  envy  you;  yea,  the  finest  and  most

magnificent things in the world, if only that true German spirit overspread

them like a dark thundercloud, pregnant with the blessing of forthcoming

rain. But you are afraid of this spirit, and it has therefore come to pass that a

cloud of another sort has thrown a heavy and oppressive atmosphere around

your universities, in which your noble-minded scholars breathe wearily and

with difficulty.  "A  tragic,  earnest,  and  instructive  attempt  was  made  in  the  present

century  to  destroy  the  cloud  I  have  last  referred  to,  and  also  to  turn  the

people's looks in the direction of the high welkin of the German spirit. In all

the annals of our universities we cannot find any trace of a second attempt,

and he who would impressively demonstrate what is now necessary for us

will never find a better example. I refer to the old, primitive Burschenschaft.

[11]

  "When the war of liberation was over, the young student brought back

home the unlooked-for and worthiest trophy of battle--the freedom of his

fatherland. Crowned with this laurel he thought of something still nobler. On

returning  to  the  university,  and  finding  that  he  was  breathing  heavily,  he

became conscious of that oppressive and contaminated air which overhung

the culture of the university. He suddenly saw, with horror-struck, wide-open

eyes, the non-German barbarism, hiding itself in the guise of all kinds of

scholasticism; he suddenly discovered that his own leaderless comrades were

abandoned  to  a  repulsive  kind  of  youthful  intoxication.  And  he  was

exasperated. He rose with the same aspect of proud indignation as Schiller

may have had when reciting the Robbers to his companions: and if he had

prefaced his drama with the picture of a lion, and the motto, 'in tyrannos,' his

follower himself was that very lion preparing to spring; and every 'tyrant'

began to tremble. Yes, if these indignant youths were looked at superficially

and timorously, they would seem to be little else than Schiller's robbers: their

talk sounded so wild to the anxious listener that Rome and Sparta seemed

mere nunneries compared with these new spirits. The consternation raised by

these young men was indeed far more general than had ever been caused by

those other 'robbers' in court circles, of which a German prince, according to

Goethe, is said to have expressed the opinion: 'If he had been God, and had

foreseen  the  appearance  of  the  Robbers,  he  would  not  have  created  the

world.'

  "Whence came the incomprehensible intensity of this alarm? For those

young men were the bravest, purest, and most talented of the band both in

dress and habits: they were distinguished by a magnanimous recklessness and

a noble simplicity. A divine command bound them together to seek harder

and more pious superiority: what could be feared from them? To what extent

this fear was merely deceptive or simulated or really true is something that

will probably never be exactly known; but a strong instinct spoke out of this

fear and out of its disgraceful and senseless persecution. This instinct hatedthe Burschenschaft with an intense hatred for two reasons: first of all on

account  of  its  organisation,  as  being  the  first  attempt  to  construct  a  true

educational  institution,  and,  secondly,  on  account  of  the  spirit  of  this

institution, that earnest, manly, stern, and daring German spirit; that spirit of

the miner's son, Luther, which has come down to us unbroken from the time

of the Reformation.

  "Think of the fate of the Burschenschaft when I ask you, Did the German

university then understand that spirit, as even the German princes in their

hatred appear to have understood it? Did the alma mater boldly and resolutely

throw her protecting arms round her noble sons and say: 'You must kill me

first, before you touch my children?' I hear your answer--by it you may judge

whether the German university is an educational institution or not.

  "The student knew at that time at what depth a true educational institution

must take root, namely, in an inward renovation and inspiration of the purest

moral faculties. And this must always be repeated to the student's credit. He

may have learnt on the field of battle what he could learn least of all in the

sphere of 'academical freedom': that great leaders are necessary, and that all

culture begins with obedience. And in the midst of victory, with his thoughts

turned to his liberated fatherland, he made the vow that he would remain

German. German! Now he learnt to understand his Tacitus; now he grasped

the signification of Kant's categorical imperative; now he was enraptured by

Weber's "Lyre and Sword" songs.[12] The gates of philosophy, of art, yea,

even of antiquity, opened unto him; and in one of the most memorable of

bloody acts, the murder of Kotzebue, he revenged--with penetrating insight

and  enthusiastic  short-sightedness--his  one  and  only  Schiller,  prematurely

consumed by the opposition of the stupid world: Schiller, who could have

been his leader, master, and organiser, and whose loss he now bewailed with

such heartfelt resentment.

  "For that was the doom of those promising students: they did not find the

leaders they wanted. They gradually became uncertain, discontented, and at

variance among themselves; unlucky indiscretions showed only too soon that

the one indispensability of powerful minds was lacking in the midst of them:

and, while that mysterious murder gave evidence of astonishing strength, it

gave no less evidence of the grave danger arising from the want of a leader.

They were leaderless--therefore they perished.

  "For I repeat it, my friends! All culture begins with the very opposite of

that  which  is  now  so  highly  esteemed  as  'academical  freedom':  withobedience,  with  subordination,  with  discipline,  with  subjection.  And  as

leaders must have followers so also must the followers have a leader--here a

certain reciprocal predisposition prevails in the hierarchy of spirits: yea, a

kind of pre-established harmony. This eternal hierarchy, towards which all

things naturally tend, is always threatened by that pseudo-culture which now

sits on the throne of the present. It endeavours either to bring the leaders

down to the level of its own servitude or else to cast them out altogether. It

seduces the followers when they are seeking their predestined leader, and

overcomes them by the fumes of its narcotics. When, however, in spite of all

this, leader and followers have at last met, wounded and sore, there is an

impassioned  feeling  of  rapture,  like  the  echo  of  an  ever-sounding  lyre,  a

feeling which I can let you divine only by means of a simile.

  "Have you ever, at a musical rehearsal, looked at the strange, shrivelled-

up, good-natured species of men who usually form the German orchestra?

What changes and fluctuations we see in that capricious goddess 'form'! What

noses and ears, what clumsy, danse macabre movements! Just imagine for a

moment that you were deaf, and had never dreamed of the existence of sound

or music, and that you were looking upon the orchestra as a company of

actors, and trying to enjoy their performance as a drama and nothing more.

Undisturbed by the idealising effect of the sound, you could never see enough

of the stern, medieval, wood-cutting movement of this comical spectacle, this

harmonious parody on the homo sapiens.

  "Now, on the other hand, assume that your musical sense has returned,

and that your ears are opened. Look at the honest conductor at the head of the

orchestra performing his duties in a dull, spiritless fashion: you no longer

think of the comical aspect of the whole scene, you listen--but it seems to you

that the spirit of tediousness spreads out from the honest conductor over all

his companions. Now you see only torpidity and flabbiness, you hear only the

trivial, the rhythmically inaccurate, and the melodiously trite. You see the

orchestra only as an indifferent, ill-humoured, and even wearisome crowd of

players.

  "But  set  a  genius--a  real  genius--in  the  midst  of  this  crowd;  and  you

instantly perceive something almost incredible. It is as if this genius, in his

lightning transmigration, had entered into these mechanical, lifeless bodies,

and as if only one demoniacal eye gleamed forth out of them all. Now look

and  listen--you  can  never  listen  enough!  When  you  again  observe  the

orchestra, now loftily storming, now fervently wailing, when you notice thequick  tightening  of  every  muscle  and  the  rhythmical  necessity  of  every

gesture,  then  you  too  will  feel  what  a  pre-established  harmony  there  is

between leader and followers, and how in the hierarchy of spirits everything

impels us towards the establishment of a like organisation. You can divine

from my simile what I would understand by a true educational institution, and

why I am very far from recognising one in the present type of university."

  [From  a  few  MS.  notes  written  down  by  Nietzsche  in  the  spring  and

autumn of 1872, and still preserved in the Nietzsche Archives at Weimar, it is

evident that he at one time intended to add a sixth and seventh lecture to the

five  just  given.  These  notes,  although  included  in  the  latest  edition  of

Nietzsche's works, are utterly lacking in interest and continuity, being merely

headings and sub-headings of sections in the proposed lectures. They do not,

indeed,  occupy  more  than  two  printed  pages,  and  were  deemed  too

fragmentary for translation in this edition.]

                                  SELECTED LETTERS

                          Translated by Anthony M. Ludovici                                        PREFACE

  THIS volume of Friedrich Nietzsche's private correspondence consists of

a selection from the five-volume edition published in Germany between the

years 1900-1909. Private letters are now recognized all the world over as a

most important supplementary trait to a literary man's portrait, revealing as

they do the more homely and intimate side of an author's mind and character.

The  special  and  additional  value  of  Nietzsche's  private  correspondence

consists in this, that here we have a writer of the most forbidding aspect, a

prophet of almost superhuman inspiration, a hermit inhabiting a desert of icy

glaciers, coming down, so to say, to the inhabited valley, to the familiar plain,

where he assumes a human form and a human speech, where he exhibits a

human  heart  and  a  human  sympathy.  He  who  still  doubted  that  behind

Nietzsche's  violent  denunciation  of  his  age  there  was  an  ardent  love  of

humanity and an eagerness to promote it to a nobler Destiny; he who still

looked askance at a thinker whose ideas were thrown out hotly and abruptly

like stones and lava out of an active volcano-all the skeptics, in short, about

Nietzsche, as well as all his enemies, will be interested to see from these

letters that there was another Nietzsche, a Nietzsche who was a good friend, a

devoted  son,  an  affectionate  brother,  and  a  generous  enemy,  such  as  the

literary history of the world with its quarrels and jealousies has not had the

good  luck  to  encounter  for  a  long  time.  The  friends  of  Nietzsche-and

Nietzsche  has  many  friends  in  all  climes  and  amongst  all  races-will  be

delighted to see their hero in the light of their own wishes and imaginations,

while  the  enemies  of  Nietzsche-and  he  still  has  many  and  by  no  means

unworthy enemies-will be bound to confess what the Lutheran Pastor Colerus

confessed in his Life of the Philosopher Spinoza: "He may have been a man

of no strict orthodoxy and an atheist into the bargain, but in the conduct of his

life  he  was  wise  and  good."  There  are  two  other  legends  which  the

publication of these letters will successfully destroy. One concerns the great

and  often  ventilated  question  of  Nietzsche's  mental  condition  and

responsibility. It has been frequently stated that his final breakdown, which

occurred in 1888, and which lasted till his death in 1900, was foreshadowed

in  his  writings  long  ago,  and  that  his  "insanity"  was  the  actual  and  only

excuse for the philosopher's haughty contempt for and bilious criticism of his

contemporaries. But where, in the light of these letters, is the insanity? That

Nietzsche's nervous system was not as perfectly balanced as that of a boxer or

cricketer may be truly conceded; what great writer was exempt from failingsof  the  flesh?  What  great  author  has  not  paid  with  his  nerves  for  those

moments of happy inspiration and intoxication which gave his best work to

posterity? "La Nevrose est la rangon du genie" ("Nervousness is the penalty

of genius.") But throughout these letters, which start in early youth and go to

the last moment of his spiritual life, there is not the slightest trace of any lack

of judgment, and only once, towards the end, a sign of the threatening doom:

everything,  apart  from  this,  is  perfectly  healthy  and  lucid,  and  even  the

curious last letter to Georg Brandes still gives a perfect sense. Why the cry of

insanity should ever have been raised against Nietzsche is hard to understand,

all the more so as a similar reproach has never been thought sufficient to

discredit the work of other famous authors or philosophers who happened to

be visited by the same affliction. No one has ever doubted Swift's genius

because his brain became clouded towards the end of his life, and August

Comte, who actually published his principal books after a confinement in a

lunatic  asylum  and  an  attempted  suicide  in  the  Seine,  is  still  a  highly

esteemed  philosopher.  But  there  is  another  and  still  more  serious  legend

which  should  be  destroyed  by  this  publication.  It  is  Nietzsche's  reputed

responsibility  for  the  World  War.  We  all  remember  that  he-together  with

some  minor  authors-was  accused  of  being  the  poisoner  of  the  modern

German  mind  whose  former  "idealism"  and  "romanticism"  Nietzsche  was

said  to  have  entirely  perverted  and  led  into  unwholesome  materialistic

channels.  Now  it  will  be  seen  from  these  letters  that  there  was  no  more

outspoken critic of the German Empire and its crude and superficial "Kultur"

than Friedrich Nietzsche. Throughout his whole life this lonely man fought

against his Fatherland and for true enlightenment: for harmony between body

and soul, between peoples and races, between authorities and subjects. It will

be a revelation to many who are still under the influence of the singular

misunderstanding  that  nowhere  was  pre-war  Germany  more  fiercely

denounced than in the writings of this German (who was, by the way, half a

Pole), and who was, in fact, the first good European. The anti-Prussian, anti-

German, anti-nationalistic current runs throughout the whole of Nietzsche's

correspondence. At the height of Germany's victory in 1870 Nietzsche wrote

from  Bale  (Nov.  7,  1870):  "As  regards  the  conditions  of  culture  in  the

immediate future I feel the deepest misgivings. If only we are not forced to

pay too dearly for this huge national success in a quarter where I at least

refuse to suffer any loss. Between ourselves: I regard the Prussia of to-day as

a power full of the greatest danger for culture." Nietzsche never wavered inhis deep distrust and his fierce denial of Imperial Germany; when near the

end of his spiritual life we still find him writing from Nice under date of

February 24, 1887: "German politics are only another form of permanent

winter and bad weather. It seems to me that Germany for the last 15 years has

become a regular school of besotment. Water, rubbish and filth, far and wide

that is what it looks like from a distance. I beg a thousand pardons, if I have

hurt your nobler feelings by stating this, but for me present-day Germany,

however much it may bristle, hedgehog-like with arms, I have no longer any

respect. It represents the stupidest, most depraved and most mendacious form

of the German spirit that has ever existed. I forgive no one for compromising

with it in any way, even if his name be Richard Wagner," etc. And this is the

man who is said to have incited his countrymen to another war of conquest!

But truth will out, even in literature. It does come out in this correspondence,

which, it may be safely predicted, will mark the end of the "moral" crusade

against one of the world's purest spirits. It will further more act as a stimulant

to the Nietzsche controversy in England and America, just as in France Prof.

Andler's [1] book has revived the interest in the German philosopher. This

last  publication,  which  is  meant  to  be  a  monumental  achievement  in  six

volumes,  is  praised  in  the  Literary  Times  of  August  11,  1921,  as  "the

recognition  by  an  eminent  French  professorial  writer  of  the  genius  of

Germany." There is, however, a slight inaccuracy in this remark. The genius

of Germany has made for barbarism, the genius of Nietzsche should make for

culture. It is in this hope that this publication goes forth into an unsettled

world. OSCAR LEVY ROYAL SOCIETIES CLUB,

  TOCTHE LETTERS

  Nietzsche To His Sister - March, 1856

  Naumburg, March 30, 1856

  DEAR ELIZETH:

  As mother is writing to you to-day I am sending you a short note to put

with hers. First of all, let me describe our journey. On the way to Weissenfels

there  was  nothing  I  objected  to  more  than  the  piercing  wind,  and  in  this

respect my two coats served me in good stead. We reached the station almost

an hour before the train came in. In the station buffet I read the Vossische

Zeitung, which had a good deal to say about the Imperial baby.[2] It is said to

have three nurses and three governesses, one of the former having allowed

him  to  fall.  The  nurse  in  question  fainted  immediately,  but  the  child  is

supposed to have given vent to a shriek loud enough for a child a year old. He

has already received two orders: the Cross of the Legion of Honour, and one

other military order. Mother asked for a glass of sugared water just as the

train entered the station. We quickly ate the sugar and wanted to get away to

our train, but were stopped by the waiter who wanted change. We could not

settle with him until at length he gave me one more sugar cake. We could

scarcely find any room in the train, but at last found two seats. On reaching

Naumburg we drove in with Bocher. When we reached the door of the house,

little Eosa, Mine, and Ottos were standing there and were very glad to see us

back; but grandmamma said she would have been ever so pleased if you had

been with us. You will certainly be delighted with Pobles, for it is a very

pretty place. I suppose you often play at ball and will be able to hit it better

than I can when you come back. I have just heard that William is very ill; he

has rheumatic fever. I wanted to take him an orange, but was not allowed to

see him. So I went to Gustav, who was very much delighted with the paper

for  the  walls  of  the  forts.  He  thanks  you  very  much  indeed  and  greatly

admires the cheapness of things in Magdeburg. My school time-table has

been changed a good deal, for my lessons start at 7. I have not yet played

with the soldiers, but will do so soon. I often wish I were at Pobles, too, and

thank our grandparents very heartily for the nice stay I had there. Remember

me most affectionately to them and also to Uncles Edmund, Theobald, Oscar,

and to our aunts. Keep well and write frequent letters to your brother,    FRIEDRICH WILHELM NIETZSCHE.

  DEAR MAMMA:

  At last I have time to answer your nice letter. I also have something to tell

you to-day that will interest you, and that is how our Schiller festival went

off. Wednesday, November 9, was "Lie-a'bed day"[4] as usual, but in the

afternoon at 4 o'clock there was a fine celebration, for which preparations had

been going on for some time. First of all, at 3.30 p.m. all the Pforta teachers

and their wives, at 3.45 the whole coetus, and at 4 p.m. all the people of

Naumburg, who flocked in greater numbers than ever before, arrived in the

gymnasium, which was decorated quite festively. The boys of the Sixth Form

opened  the  performance  with  a  reading  of  the  Piccolomini.  Professor

Koberstein chose the part of Wallenstein himself and read it magnificently.

Then "The Bell," composed by Romberg, was sung with piano and violin

accompaniment.  It  was  wonderfully  successful,  and  everybody  was  very

much moved, particularly by the fine chorus, in "Freedom and Equality it is

heard to toll," etc. (I have been in the ladies choir some time now, and had the

joy of rehearsing this peace with them.) The following day was also "Lie-a

bed day," with lessons until 9.30 a.m.; then followed another celebration in

the gymnasium, beginning with the choir, Frisch auf Kameraden. Then came

the recitation of original poems written by Upper School boys about various

incidents in Schiller's life. Herzog and von Gohring then sang, "Before His

Lion-garden";  and  "Oh,  From  Out  This  Valley's  Grounds,"  with  piano

accompaniment, and then Professor Koberstein stepped on to the platform.

He gave an excellent address, in which he laid particular stress upon the fact

that it was a hopeful sign for Germany that the birthdays of her great men

were  becoming  ever  more  and  more  the  occasions  for  national  festivities

which, in spite of the political disunion of the country, were welding her into

a single whole. Then followed a good feed with roast goose and cakes, after

which we were allowed to go out for a walk until 3 o'clock. I called on Aunt

Rosalie, who gave me a cup of chocolate. In the evening the Sixth Form had

a dance, but the rest of us had music in the ballroom. Now, wasn't that a fine

festival?  I  am  delighted  with  your  idea  of  returning  to  Naumburg  at

Christinas and am much looking forward to that lovely time.

  Your FR. W. NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - February, 1862  Pforta, February, 1862.

  DEAR MAMMA:

  So you have sent dear Lizzie right away for some considerable time, and

she will certainly wish to be back and will not feel very much at home in the

great city of Dresden. You yourself must have spent some beautiful days

there, particularly owing to your recollections of bygone times; for, as the

years roll by, everything that once caused us pleasure or surprise becomes a

precious memory. And it must have cost you something to say good-bye to

Lizzie and to Dresden of that I am well aware. As to how she is settled there,

I know nothing; write me a long and exhaustive letter. Indeed, we might both

of us write more exhaustively to each other, as there is no need now for you

to spend so much of your time over your house duties.

  I only hope she has been sent to a thoroughly good school. I cannot say I

like Dresden very much; it is not grand enough, and in detail, even in its

language, it is too Thuringian in character. If she had gone to Hanover, for

instance, she would have become acquainted with customs, peculiarities, and

a language of an absolutely different order. It is always a good thing, if one

does not wish to become too one-sided, to be educated in different places.

Otherwise, as a city of art, as the seat of a small court, and generally for the

purpose of completing E.'s education, Dresden will be quite suitable, and to

some  extent  I  envy  her.  Still,  I  believe  that  in  my  life  I  shall  have

opportunities  enough  of  enjoying  experiences  of  the  kind  she  is  having.

Altogether  I  am  very  anxious  to  hear  how  Elizabeth  gets  on  in  her  new

surroundings. There is always a certain element of risk in such schools. But I

have thorough confidence in Elizabeth. If only she could learn to write a little

better! When she is describing anything, too, she must try and avoid all those

"Ahs!' and "Ohs!" "You cannot imagine how magnificent, how marvellous,

how bewitching, etc., it was," etc.-she must drop this sort of thing, and very

much more that she will, I hope, forget in refined company and by keeping a

sharp lookout on herself. Now, dear Mamma, on Monday you will come out

here,  won't  you?  The  performance  is  from  4  to  7  p.m.  I  have  asked  Dr.

Heinze for a ticket. I should be awfully glad if you would send me half a

mandala each of sugar and eggs, because for our rehearsals, which are held

twice  a  day  and  three  times  on  the  day  of  the  performance,  some  such

treatment for the voice is absolutely necessary.

    Farewell, dear Mamma!

  Your FRITZ.  ( Marginal note. ) As you will have plenty of time for reading now, I

would recommend Auerbach's "Barf�ssele." I was highly delighted with it.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - November, 1862

  Pforta, November 10, 1862.

  DEAR MAMMA:

  I am very sorry that I was not able to meet you at Almrich yesterday, but I

was prevented from coming by being kept in. And thereby hangs a tale which

I will tell you.

  Every  week  one  of  the  newest  Sixth  Form  boys  has  to  undertake  the

duties  of  schoolhouse  prefect  that  is  to  say,  he  has  to  make  a  note  of

everything in the rooms, cupboards, and lecture rooms that requires repair,

and to send up a list of his observations to the inspection office. Last week I

had to perform this duty, and it occurred to me that its somewhat tedious

nature might be slightly relieved by the exercise of a little humour, and I

wrote out a list in which all my observations were couched in the form of

jokes.[5]  The  stern  masters,  who  were  very  much  surprised  that  anyone

should introduce humour into so solemn an undertaking, summoned me to

attend the Synod on Saturday and pronounced the following extraordinary

sentence: Three hours detention and the loss of one or two walks. If I could

accuse myself of any other fault than that of thoughtlessness, I should be

angry about it; but as it is I have not troubled myself for one moment about

the matter, and have only drawn this moral from it: To be more careful in

future what I joke about.

  To-day is Martinmas Day,[6] and we have had the usual Martinmas goose

for dinner (in twelve parts, of course). St. Nicholas Day, too, will soon be

here. This period of transition from autumn to winter is a pleasant time; it is

the preparation for Christmas which I enjoy so much. Let us thoroughly enjoy

it together. Write to me soon. My love to dear uncle and Lizzie.

  FRITZ.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - April, 1863

    Thursday Morning, Pforta, April, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER:

  If  I  write  to  you  to-day  it  is  certainly  about  the  saddest  and  most

unpleasant business that it has ever been my lot to relate. For I have been

very wicked and do not know whether you will or can forgive me. It is with a

heavy heart and most unwillingly that I take up my pen to write to you, more

particularly  when  I  think  of  our  pleasant  and  absolutely  unruffled  timetogether during the Easter holidays. Well, last Sunday I got drunk and have

no excuse but this, that I did not know how much I could stand and that I

happened  to  be  somewhat  excited  that  afternoon.  When  I  returned,  Herr

Kern, one of the masters, came across me in that condition. He had me called

before the Synod on Tuesday, when I was degraded to third of my division

and  one  hour  of  my  Sunday  walk  was  cancelled.  You  can  imagine  how

depressed and miserable I feel about it, and especially at having to cause you

so much sorrow over such a disgraceful affair, the like of which has never

occurred in my life before. It also makes me feel very sorry on the Rev.

Kletschke's  account,  who  had  only  just  shown  me  such  unexpected

confidence.[7]  Through  this  one  lapse  I  have  completely  spoilt  the  fairly

good position I succeeded in winning for myself last term. I am so much

annoyed with myself that I can't even get on with my work or settle down at

all. Write to me soon and write severely, for I deserve it; and no one knows

better than I do how much I deserve it.

  There is no need for me to give you any further assurances as to how

seriously I shall pull myself together, for now a great deal depends upon it. I

had once again grown too cocksure of myself, and this self confidence has

now, at all events, been completely shaken, and in a very unpleasant manner.

  I shall go and see the Rev. Kletschke to-day and have a talk with him. By-

the-bye, do not tell anyone anything about it if it is not already known. Also,

please send me my muffler as soon as possible, for I am constantly suffering

from hoarseness and pains in my chest. Send me the comb too that I have

spoken about. Now, good-bye and write to me very soon, and do not be too

cross with me, mother dear.

  Your very sorrowful

  FRITZ.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - May, 1863

  Pforta, May, 1863.

  DEAR MOTHER:

  As regards my future, it is precisely my practical doubts about it that

trouble me. The decision as to what subject I shall specialize in will not come

of  its  own  accord.  I  must,  therefore,  consider  the  question  and  make  my

choice, and it is precisely this choice which causes me so many difficulties.

Of course, it will be my endeavour to study thoroughly anything that I decide

to take up, but it is precisely on this account that the choice is so difficult; for

one feels constrained to choose that branch of study in which one can hope todo something complete. And how illusory such hopes often are; how often

does one not allow oneself to be transported by a momentary prepossession,

or by an old family tradition, or by one's own personal wishes, so that the

choice of a calling seems like a lottery in which there are a large number of

blanks  and  very  few  winning  numbers.  Now,  I  happen  to  be  in  the

particularly  unfortunate  position  of  possessing  a  whole  host  of  interests

connected  with  the  most  different  branches  of  learning,  and,  though  the

general gratification of these interests may make a learned man of me, they

will scarcely convert me into a creature with a vocation. The fact, therefore,

that I must destroy some of these interests is perfectly clear to me, as well as

the fact that I must allow some new ones to find a home in my brain. But

which of them will be so unfortunate as to be cast overboard? Perhaps just

the children of my heart!

  I cannot express myself more plainly; it is evident that the position is

critical and I must have come to a decision by this time next year. It certainly

won't  come  of  its  own  accord,  and  I  know  too  little  about  the  various

subjects.

  Best wishes to you all.

  FRITZ.

  Nietzsche To His Mother and Sister - Sept., 1864

  Elberfeld, Sept. 27, 1864.

  DEAR MAMMA AND LIZZIE:

  From the look of my handwriting you are to gather that I am writing to

you from a business house. I am thinking how glad you will be to have news

of me so soon, particularly as I have only good and pleasant things to tell

you. Of course, what I should have liked most of all would have been to tell

you everything by word of mouth, but the time seems long past when this

wish might have been gratified.

  There was nothing very beautiful or interesting about the journey; first of

all, a number of sleepy and snoring travelling companions, then some very

talkative, noisy and common ones, followed by factory hands and business

men or very exacting old ladies; I could tell a funny story about each one of

these varieties.

  We arrived at about 11 o clock at night feeling sleepy and somewhat

peevish.  Believe  me,  one  feels  amazingly  tired  after  such  a  long  day's

journey. We put up at Br�nning's, at the house of two ladies who were not

so  very  old  and  their  brother,  who  was  in  bed  with  gastric  fever.  Werefreshed ourselves with bread and wine, went to bed, slept splendidly, got up

late, had our breakfast-consisting here, as every where, of fine rolls and slices

of Pumpernickel bread-and then we called on the Rohrs and found Johanna

and Marie at home both nice girls but not quite my style; they were a little

tasteless in their dress. Of course, one must not forget that they are under the

care of a very pious old lady, with whom on the following day I became

involved in a long discussion about the theatre, "the work of the Devil," and

held my ground very well, but only succeeded in earning her compassion for

one who held such views as mine. We have been invited to coffee there to-

day.  Well,  on  Sunday  I  made  the  acquaintance  of  Ernest  Schnabel,  an

exceedingly attractive young business man; as you know, he is Deussen's

well-known and more favoured rival; and I also met Friedrich Deussen, who

has a post in a business firm here. In the afternoon we went up together into

the hills that encircle Elberfeld. Imagine a beautiful long valley, the valley of

the Wupper, through which a number of ill-defined straggling towns, one of

which is Elberfeld, extend like a mighty chain of factories, and you have a

picture of these parts. The town is commercial in the extreme, and most of the

houses  are  slate  roofed.  I  notice  that  the  women  here  have  a  particular

predilection for drooping their heads in a pious way. The girls dress very

smartly in little coats very tight at the waist, like that Polish girl from Kosen.

The men all display a fondness for light brown, their hats, trousers, etc., all

being of that colour. After we had been to several restaurants on Sunday, we

spent the evening most congenially at Ernest Schnabel's, where we stayed till

11 p. m. He gave us an extremely fine Moselle to drink-"Pastor's Moselle

Drink," as Ernest called it. My improvising at the piano had a great success,

and my health was most solemnly drunk. As Lizzie would say, Ernest is

"perfectly enchanted." Wherever I am, I have to play and everybody cries

"Bravo!" It is ludicrous. Yesterday we drove to Schwelm, a neighbouring

watering  place;  we  visited  the  red  hills,  a  famous  site  of  the  ancient

Westphalian Vehme court, and we had a drink everywhere.

  In the evening, at the inn, I played without knowing it in the presence of a

famous orchestra conductor, who stood there afterwards gasping with wonder

and said all sorts of nice things to me. He also begged me to join his choral

society that evening-a thing I did not do. Instead I drove back and was invited

to dine with the Schnabel family. They are nice, good people. Mrs. Schnabel

is delightful, and her husband is a decent, pious, conservative business man.

They have the most excellent food, and the drinks are even better, but theirdishes are different from ours. They eat Gruy�re cheese and Pumpernickel

bread three times a day.

  . . . Now, good-bye, good-bye! Hearty remembrances to Aunt Rosalie.

  Your FRITZ.

  DEAR MAMMA AND LIZZIE:

  On Sunday we were en masse in Sieburg, where we marched through the

streets cheering, danced, and returned rather late. An hour ago I was at an

exceedingly distinguished concert; it was an extraordinary display of wealth.

All the ladies were dressed in bright red,[8] and English was spoken all over

the hall; I don't speak English.[9] Admittance cost three marks, but as I am

one of the performers it cost me nothing. But to make up for things I went

there dressed as smartly as possible, with a white waistcoat and kid gloves. I

seem to write an inordinate number of letters, and yet I get none except from

you. Have Gersdorff and Kuttig been to see you? Remember me to them and

also to the dear Naumburg aunts. Ever with devotion and love.

  Your FRITZ.

  Saturday.

  MY DEAR MAMMA AND LIZZIE:

  The lovely time of the holidays draws ever nearer, and I must confess that

my longing to see you again grows keener every day. You might shortly start

making the preparations for my arrival, for I shall be with you soon after the

middle of next month. The more disagreeable the weather is now, the more

do I like to dwell upon the beautiful days at Easter, and naturally I have never

felt so happy at the thought of the holidays as I feel now. How delightful life

will seem for me in your dear company, compared with the life I lead here, so

destitute of all family associations! In addition to that, I shall be near so many

dear  friends,  and  to  dear  old  Pforta,  to  which  we  old  Pforta  boys  are  so

absurdly attached.

  I imagine the whole of this passage will make you feel a little wistful; but

unfortunately I must dissipate this mood for you by referring to the inevitable

and irksome question of money. Among other things now I am going to the

most desperate efforts to make two ends meet, and, like the Treasury, on

drawing up my budget for the year I arrive only at the most hopeless results.Among the financial coups I have in view is the plan of moving out of my

present lodgings next term, giving up the hire of a piano in order-to put it

quite plainly-to cut down expenses. One learns a tremendous lot in one term,

even in the realm of material things; but it is a pity that one has to pay so

dearly for these lessons. But now I will close these pathetic and bathetic

details by begging you, dear Mamma, to send me the money for the next two

months in a lump sum of not less than 240 marks, to include my railway fare.

Altogether I am not in favour of monthly instalments; they inevitably lead

one into debt. Up to the present I have only been in a position to settle the

most  pressing  debts  of  the  previous  month  by  means  of  these  monthly

instalments and have scarcely ever had any cash in hand. Generally speaking,

it is quite out of the question for me to hope to get on at Bonn on less than

1,200  marks,  and  that  was  the  amount  my  guardian  promised  me  at  the

beginning of my university life. If you only knew how we live here you

would  understand  this.  It  is  the  minimum  amount  possible  in  the

circumstances.

  So  now  I  have  said  all  I  had  to  say  on  this  matter,  although  I  know

perfectly well that it will not please you any more than it pleases me. Why

can't I settle all this direct with my guardian? These things spoil my beautiful

letters! And now let me beg of you once more not to fail me and thus plunge

me into difficulties from which I could and should have to extricate myself

only by borrowing the money in some way.

  And now let us banish all care from our brow and chat pleasantly for a

while. The things I have to tell you naturally accumulate more and more

every day. . . .

  I pass here among the students, etc., as something of an authority on

music, and as a queer customer into the bargain, like all old Pforta boys in the

Franconia.[10] I am not disliked at all, although I am apt to scoff a little and

am  considered  as  somewhat  ironical.  This  estimate  of  my  character,

according to the opinions of other people, will not be without interest to you.

For my part I must add that I do not agree to the first particular, that I am

frequently unhappy and that I have too many moods and am rather inclined to

be a nagging spirit (Qutilgeist) not only to myself, but also to others.

  And now good-bye! For Heaven's sake send me the money in good time,

and remember me to our dear relatives. With hearty thanks for your nice

letters and begging you still to think kindly of me in spite of this one,

    FRIEDBICH WILHELM NIETZSCHE.  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - May, 1865

  Bonn, May 25, 1865.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  To begin with, I must own that I have been simply longing for your first

letter from G�ttingen, not only out of friendship, but also because of its

psychological interest. I was hoping that it might reflect the impression just

made upon you by the life led in the Students Corps, and I felt certain that

you would speak out quite frankly on the subject.

  Now, this is precisely what you have done, and I thank you most heartily.

At present, therefore, I share your excellent brother's views on this matter; I

can only admire the moral strength with which you have plunged into dirty

muddy water and even exercised your limbs in it, in order to learn to swim in

the stream of life. Pardon the cruelty of the metaphor, but I think it meets the

case.

    Besides, there is this important point to remember: if a man wishes to

understand his age and his contemporaries, he must be something of a colour

student.  Societies  and  associations,  together  with  the  tendencies  they

represent, generally reveal with almost perfect exactitude the type of the next

generation  of  men.  Moreover,  the  question  of  the  reorganization  of  the

circumstances of student life is urgent enough to deter the individual from

investigating and judging the conditions from his own particular experience.

Of course, we must take care that we ourselves do not become too deeply

influenced during the process of our research; for habit exercises a prodigious

power. A man has already lost a good deal when he can no longer feel any

moral indignation at the reprehensible actions daily perpetrated in his circle.

This is true, for instance, of drink and drunkenness, and also of the disrespect

and scorn with which other men and other opinions are treated.

  I readily admit that, up to a point, I had very much the same experiences

as  yourself,  that  the  spirit  of  conviviality  on  drinking  evenings  often

discomfited  me  exceedingly,  that  there  were  fellows  whose  "beer

materialism"  made  them  utterly  repulsive  to  me;  whilst  the  appalling

arrogance with which in a twinkling men and opinions were disposed of en

masse used to irritate me beyond endurance. Nevertheless I was content to

bear with the Association, not only because it taught me a good deal, but also

because I was, on the whole, compelled to acknowledge the intellectual life

which formed a part of it. On the whole, though, a more intimate relationship

with one or two friends is a necessity, and, provided one can enjoy this, therest can be reckoned as a sort of seasoning included in the fare-some as salt

and pepper, others as sugar, and yet others as nothing at all.

  Once  again  let  me  assure  you  that  all  you  have  told  me  about  your

struggles and anxieties only enhances my esteem and love for you.

  This term I have to prepare our archaeological work for the college. Then

I also have a bigger piece of work to do for the Science evening of our

Burschenschaft [Corps] about the political poets of Germany. I hope to learn

a good deal from this, but I shall also have to do a tremendous amount of

reading and collect plenty of material. Above all, however, I must set about

preparing a more important philological work, the subject of which I have not

yet decided, in order to qualify for admittance to the college at Leipzig.

    Incidentally  I  am  now  studying  Beethoven's  Life  in  the  biography  by

Marx. I shall also perhaps do a little composing again, a thing which this year

I  have  so  far  strenuously  avoided.  I  have  also  stopped  versifying.  The

Rhineland Musical Festival takes place this Whitsun at Cologne. Do come

over from G�ttingen for it! The principal items on the programme are: Israel

in Egypt, by Handel; Faust Music, by Schumann; The Seasons, by Haydn,

etc., etc. I am taking part in it. Immediately after it the Cologne International

Exhibit will be opened. You will find all further details in the papers.

  Well, old man, fare thee well!

  I rejoice at the thought of our next meeting. I wish you plenty of good

cheer and bright spirits, and, above all, a man who can be something to you.

Excuse my execrable writing and my ill humour about it. You know how

wild I get over it and how my thoughts then come to a standstill.

  Your devoted friend,

  FR. NIETZSCHE.

  Bonn, June 30, 1865.

  Friday Morning.

  DEAR MAMMA:

  I  am  very  much  disgusted  by  the  bigoted  Roman  Catholic  population

here. Often I can scarcely believe that we are in the nineteenth century. Not

long ago it was Corpus Christi Day. Processions after the style of that of the

Church Festival; everybody very finely got up and therefore full of vanity,

and yet going into all kinds of pious contortions, croaking and groaning old

women, tremendous squandering of incense, wax candles, and festoons offlowers. On the afternoon of the same day a genuine Tyrolean company gave

a concert with the usual affected naturalness and the stereotyped emotions in

the rendering of the Andreas Hofer[11] song.

  You  will  have  read  in  the  papers  about  the  Rhineland  festival.  As

everybody knows, the Rhineland was annexed to Prussia fifty years ago. The

King, the General Staff, and several Ministers attended the ceremony. The

papers  speak  of  the  enthusiasm  and  rejoicing  of  the  people.  As  I  was  in

Cologne at the time, I can form my own estimate of these rejoicings. I was

amazed by such coldness on the part of the masses. But I really cannot see

where the enthusiasm for the King and his Ministers should come from at this

particular  juncture.  All  the  same,  externally  the  ceremony  was  extremely

imposing. The Rhine, the bridge over it, the innumerable hotels on the banks,

the  towers,  and  the  mighty  cathedral  all  ablaze  with  illuminations,  a

continuous deafening boom of guns and muskets, myriads of fireworks all let

off at the same time at various points all these seen from the opposite bank

produced an almost magical impression. It would be impossible to imagine a

finer effect for an opera. The King in a steamer sailed up and down stream in

the midst of it all; the youth of Cologne created enthusiasm by singing the

D�ppel march[12]; the masses cheered at the sight of such fine things, and

the  monarch  was  well  pleased.  I  saw  some  fine  uniforms  there,  my  dear

Lizzie. But the old generals who wore these beautiful clothes strolled through

the streets smiling good-naturedly; for they had happily survived the D�ppel

engagement of a copious dinner and were all very drunk with victory.

  Not long ago we-that is to say, the Franconians-had a Commers[13] with

two other student associations, the Helvetia and the Marchia. Oh! what bliss!

Oh! the marvellous exploits of the Students Association! Do we represent the

future of Germany? Are we not the nursery of German parliaments? "It is

some times difficult," says Juvenal, "to refrain from writing a satire."

  I think I have already told you that we have changed the colours in our

caps. We now wear fine red south-westers, with gold braid and broad black

chin straps.

    Remember me to dear Lizzie and all our relatives and friends.

  Your affectionate

  FRITZ.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - April, 1866

  Naumburg, April 7, 1866.

  DEAR FRIEND:  Now  and  again  one  enjoys  hours  of  peaceful  reflection  when,  with

mingled gladness and sorrow, one seems to hover over one's life just as those

lovely  summer  days,  so  exquisitely  described  by  Emerson,  seem  to  lie

stretched out at ease above the hilltops. It is then, as he says, that Nature is

perfect, and we feel the same; then we are free from the spell of the ever

vigilant will; then we are nothing but a pure, contemplative and dispassionate

eye.[14] It is in a mood such as this-a mood desirable above all others-that I

take up my pen to reply to your kind and thoughtful letter. The interests we

share have become welded together to the smallest particle; once again we

have realized that mere strokes of the pen in fact, even the most unexpected

whims in the past of a few individuals determine the history of countless

numbers of others; and we readily leave it to the pious to thank their God for

these accidents. We may perhaps laugh at this thought when we meet again in

Leipzig.

  I had already made myself familiar with the thought of being a soldier. I

often  wished  that  I  might  be  snatched  from  my  monotonous  labours;  I

yearned for the opposite extreme to my excitement, to the tempestuous stress

of my life and to the raptures of my enthusiasm. For, despite all my efforts, it

has been brought home to me more clearly every day that it is impossible to

shuffle such work out of one's coat sleeve. During the holidays I have learnt,

relatively speaking, a good deal, and now they are at an end. My Theognis

finds itself at least one term further forward. I have, moreover, made many

illuminating  discoveries  which  will  considerably  enrich  my  quaestiones

Theognideae.[15]

  For  recreation  I  turn  to  three  things,  and  a  wonderful  recreation  they

provide! my Schopenhauer, Schumann's music, and, finally, solitary walks.

Yesterday a heavy storm hung in the sky, and I hastened up a neighbouring

hill, called Leusch (perhaps you can explain the word to me?). On the summit

I found a hut and a man killing two kids, with his son looking on. The storm

broke  with  a  mighty  crash,  discharging  thunder  and  hail,  and  I  felt

inexpressibly well and full of zest, and realized with singular clearness that to

understand Nature one must go to her as I had just done, as a refuge from all

worries and oppressions. What did man with his restless will matter to me

then? What did I care for the eternal "Thou shalt" and "Thou shalt not"? How

different  are  lightning,  storm  and  hail-free  powers  without  ethics!  How

happy, how strong they are-pure will untrammeled by the muddling influence

of the intellect!  For have I not seen examples enough of how muddling a man's intellect

frequently is? Not long ago I had occasion to speak to a man who was on the

point of going out to India as a missionary. I put a few questions to him and

learned that he had not read a single Indian work, knew nothing about the

Upanishads-not even their name-and had resolved to have nothing to do with

the Brahmans because they had philosophical training. Holy Ganges!

  To-day I listened to a profoundly clever sermon of ---s on Christianity-the

Faith that has conquered the world. It was intolerably haughty in its attitude

towards  all  nations  that  were  not  Christian,  and  yet  it  was  exceedingly

ingenious. For instance, every now and then he would describe as Christian

something else, which always gave an appropriate sense even according to

our  lights.  If  the  sentence,  "Christianity  has  conquered  the  world,"  be

changed to "the feeling of sin," or briefly "a metaphysical need has conquered

the world," we can raise no reasonable objection; but then one ought to be

consistent  and  say,  "All  true  Hindus  are  Christians,"  and  also  "All  true

Christians are Hindus." As a matter of fact, how ever, the interchange of such

words and concepts as these, which have a fixed meaning, is not altogether

honest; it lands the poor in spirit in total confusion. If by Christianity is meant

"Faith in an historical event, or in an historical personage," I have nothing to

do with it. If, however, it is said to signify briefly a craving for salvation or

redemption, then I can set a high value upon it, and do not even object to its

endeavouring  to  discipline  the  philosophers.  For  how  very  few  these  are

compared to the vast masses of men who are in need of salvation! How many

of them are not actually made of the same stuff as these masses! If only all

those who dabble in philosophy were followers of Schopenhauer! But only

too often behind the mask of philosopher stands the exalted majesty of the

"Will,"  which  is  trying  to  achieve  its  own  self-glorification.  If  the

philosophers ruled ???�?? f?[16] would be lost; were the masses to prevail,

as they do at present, the philosophers rari in gurgite rasto[17] would still be

able, like Aeschylus, d??a ????? f????e??.[18]

  Apart  from  this,  it  is  certainly  extremely  irksome  to  restrain  our

Schopenhauerian ideas, still so young, vigorous and half expressed; and to

have  weighing  forever  upon  our  hearts  this  unfortunate  disparity  between

theory  and  practice.  And  for  this  I  can  think  of  no  consolation;  on  the

contrary, I am in need of it myself.

  And now farewell, old man! Remember me to all your family. Mine wish

to be remembered to you; let us leave it at that. When we meet again we shallprobably smile, and rightly too!

  Yours,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - January, 1867

  Leipzig, End of January, 1867.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  At the beginning of January at Naumburg I too stood at the deathbed of a

near relative. Next to my mother and sister, this dear lady had the greatest

claim on my love and veneration. She had always displayed the most devoted

interest in my career, and with her I seem to have lost a whole piece of my

past and especially of my childhood. And yet, when I received your letter, my

poor  dear  afflicted  friend,  I  was  overcome  by  a  much  deeper  grief.  The

difference between the two deaths seemed so enormous. There, in Naumburg,

a life replete with good deeds had at last been consummated, and despite a

weakly  constitution  had  at  least  lasted  well  into  old  age.  We  all  had  the

feeling that the strength both of her mind and her body was exhausted, and

that only for our love had death come too soon. But what have we not lost by

the  death  of  your  brother,  before  whom  I  too  stood  in  such  constant

admiration and respect!

  We have lost one of those rare noble Roman natures about whom Rome

at her zenith would have boasted and of whom you, as his brother, have an

even  greater  right  to  be  proud.  For  how  seldom  does  our  wretched  age

produce such heroic figures! But you know what the ancients thought on the

subject: "Those whom the gods love die young."

  What wonders such a power might have achieved! As a pattern of self-

reliant and glorious endeavour, as an example of a decided character true to

himself  and  indifferent  to  the  world  and  its  opinion,  what  strength  and

comfort he might have afforded to thousands caught in life's wild vortex! I

am well aware that this vir bonus in the best sense meant even more to you;

that, as you often used to tell me in the past, he constituted the ideal to which

you  aspired,  your  fixed  guiding  star  amid  all  the  tortuous  and  difficult

highways and byways of life. His death has probably been the severest blow

that could possibly have overtaken you.

  Now, dear old man, you have realized-so I gather from the tone of your

letter-through  your  own  bitter  experience,  why  our  Schopenhauer  extols

suffering and affliction as indispensable to a splendid destiny, as the de?te???

p????;[19]to the denial of the Will. You have also felt and experienced thechastening, inwardly becalming, and bracing power of pain. This has been a

time  during  which  you  have  yourself  tested  the  truth  of  Schopenhauer's

doctrine. If the fourth book of his principal work now makes a disagreeable,

gloomy, and tedious impression upon you; if it has not the power to bear you

triumphantly  beyond  all  the  terrible  outward  pain  into  that  sweetly

melancholy but happy mood which possesses us at the sound of lofty music,

into that mood in which one sees one's earthly shell fall from one, then it is

possible that even I, too, may have nothing more to do with his philosophy.

Only he who is brimful of anguish can pronounce the decisive judgment on

such matters. We others, standing in the middle of the stream of life and

things, and longing for the Denial of the Will merely as for the island of the

blest,  cannot  judge  whether  the  consolations  of  such  a  philosophy  are

adequate for times of deep sorrow.

  I conclude with a hearty farewell and a quotation from Aristotle:

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - February, 1867

  Leipzig, February, 1867.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  If you are not in a mood to listen to a host of weird things, just put this

letter aside and reserve it for another occasion.

  Pious people believe that all the suffering and mishaps that come their

way have been sent to them with the most careful premeditation, in order that

this or that thought, such and such a resolution or understanding might be

kindled in them. We lack the very first principles on which such a faith is

based. It does lie in our power, however, to suck every event, every trivial or

serious  mishap,  dry  and  to  turn  it  to  account  for  our  improvement  and

discipline. The predestined character of every individual's fate is no myth if

we understand it in this sense. What we have to do is intentionally to turn our

fate to account, for events are, in themselves, but insignificant accessories to

this end. It all turns upon our personal attitude. An event has no more value

than  we  choose  to  invest  it  with.  Thoughtless  and  unmoral  people  know

nothing of this purposefulness of fate. Events make no lasting impression

upon them. We, however, wish to learn something from them, and the more

our knowledge of moral affairs increases and the more complete it becomes,the more surely will the events of our life link themselves up into a fast-

bound ring, or will at least seem to do so. You know, old man, what I mean

by these remarks.

  And now, with the expression of my mother's, my cousin's and my own

sincere sympathy, I will take my leave of you for today.

  Yours affectionately,

  F. N.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - April, 1867

  Naumburg, April 6, 1867.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  Heaven alone knows the cause of my long silence, for I am never more

thankful or more happy than when your letters arrive to give me news of your

doings and your spirits.

  During the holidays I intend to make a written record of my work on the

sources of Diogenes Laertius, though I am anything but far advanced. For

your amusement let me confess what it is that gives me the most pain and

trouble my German style (not to mention my Latin). But I have come to an

understanding with my mother tongue, so foreign languages cannot fail to

follow suit. The scales have fallen from my eyes; too long had I lived in

stylistic innocence. The categorical imperative, "Thou shalt and must write,"

has called me to my senses. Truth to tell, I made an attempt I had never made

since  my  Gymnasium  days  namely,  to  write  well  and  suddenly  my  pen

seemed to become paralyzed in my hand. I could do nothing and felt very

angry.  Meanwhile  my  ears  rang  with  Lessing's,  Lichtenberg's,  and

Schopenhauer's precepts on style. It was a constant comfort to me to know

that these authorities were unanimous in declaring that to write well was a

difficult matter, that no man was born with a good style, and that in order to

acquire  the  capacity  one  had  to  work  hard  and  keep  one's  nose  to  the

grindstone. God forbid that I should write again in such a wooden, dry style

and  with  so  much  logical  tightlacing  as  I  did  in  my  Theognis  essay,  for

instance,  on  the  cradle  of  which  none  of  the  Graces  ever  lighted  (on  the

contrary, it was more like the distant booming of the cannon at Koniggratz).

[21] It would be hard indeed not to be able to write better than this when one

longs so ardently to do so. The first thing to do is to let a number of bright

and lively spirits loose upon one's style; I must play upon it as if it were a

keyboard. But I must not play the things I have learnt, but improvise freely,

as freely as possible, and yet with logic and beauty.  Secondly, I am disturbed by another wish. One of my oldest Naumburg

friends, Wilhelm Finder, is just going in for his first Law examination you

and I know the qualms inseparable from such a time. But what attracts me

and  even  tempts  me  to  follow  suit  is  not  the  examination  itself,  but  the

preparation  for  it.  How  valuable  and  uplifting  it  must  be  to  let  all  the

disciplined elements of one's science march past one in the space of about six

months,  and  thus  obtain  for  once  a  general  view  of  the  whole!  Is  it  not

exactly  as  if  an  officer,  accustomed  always  to  the  mere  drilling  of  his

company, were suddenly to behold in battle the magnificent fruit his small

efforts could bear? For it cannot be denied that the uplifting general view of

antiquity is altogether lacking in most philosophers because they stand too

close to the picture and examine a spot of oil instead of admiring and, what is

more, enjoying the broad and bold outlines of the composition as a whole.

When, I ask you, shall we at last realize that pure enjoyment in our studies of

antiquity about which, alas! we have so often talked?

    Thirdly, the whole of our method of working is horrible. The hundred and

one books lying on the table before me are only so many pincers consuming

all the vitality out of the nerve of independent thought. I verily believe, old

man, that with a bold hand you have selected the best possible lot-that is to

say, an active contrast, a reversed standpoint, an absolutely different attitude

towards life, mankind, work, and duty. By this I do not mean to praise your

present calling, as such, but only in so far as it constitutes the negation of

your former life, together with its object and its point of view. Amid such

contrasts body and soul keep healthy, and none of those inevitable morbid

symptoms appear which in the scholar are caused by a preponderance of

intellectual, and, in the clodhopper, by a preponderance of bodily exercise. Of

course, the morbidity manifests itself differently in each. The Greeks were no

scholars,  but  neither  were  they  brainless  athletes.  Are  we,  therefore,

necessarily bound to exercise a choice between the one or the other way of

living? Is it not possible that with Christianity a division was made in this

realm of man's nature also, which the nation of harmony knew nothing about?

Ought  not  every  scholar  to  blush  at  the  thought  of  Sophocles,  who,

distinguished as he was in the domain of the spirit, was yet able to dance with

grace and understood the art of playing at ball? But we stand towards these

things  as  we  stand  towards  life  in  general;  we  readily  recognize  an  evil

condition, but we do not raise a finger to get rid of it. And here I might easily

begin a fourth lamentation, but in the presence of my martial friend I willrefrain. For a warrior must be much more nauseated by these jeremiads than a

home-bird like myself.

    Incidentally I have just called to mind a recent experience that offers a

very good illustration of the scholar's morbid symptoms. As such it might

perhaps be hushed up, but it will amuse you because it is nothing more than

the translation of Schopenhauer's essay "On Professors of Philosophy" into

real life.

  In  a  certain  town  a  young  man  endowed  with  quite  extraordinary

intellectual gifts, particularly in the direction of philosophical speculation,

made up his mind to obtain a Doctor's degree. With this object in view, he

gathered together the threads of his system "Concerning the Fundamental

Delusion of Representation," which he had laboriously thought out for years,

and was very happy and proud at the result. With these feelings surging in his

breast, he submitted the work to the Philosophical Faculty of the place, which

happened to be a university town. Two professors of philosophy had to give

their opinion on his production, and this is how they acquitted themselves of

the task: The first said that, though the work showed undoubted intellectual

power,  it  did  not  advocate  the  doctrines  taught  at  his  institution;  and  the

second declared that not only did the views not correspond with the common

understanding of mankind, but they were also paradoxical. The work was

consequently  rejected,  and  its  author  did  not  receive  his  Doctor's  degree.

Fortunately the rejected candidate was not humble enough to recognize the

voice of wisdom in this verdict nay, he was sufficiently presumptuous to

maintain  that  this  particular  Philosophical  Faculty  was  lacking  in  the

philosophical facultas.

  In short, old man, one cannot pursue one's path too independently. Truth

seldom resides in the temple men have built in her honour, or where priests

have been ordained to her service. The good work or the rubbish we produce

we alone have to pay for, not those who have given us their good or their

foolish advice. Let us at least have the pleasure of scoring our blunders off

our own bat. There is no such thing as a general recipe for the assistance of

all men. One must be one's own doctor and gather one's medical experience

on one's own body. As a matter of fact, we give too little thought to our own

welfare; our egoism is not shrewd enough, our reason not selfish enough.

  With this, old man, let me now take my leave of you. Unfortunately I

have nothing "solid" or "real," or whatever the current phrase among young

business men is, to report; but you will certainly not regret that.  Your devoted friend,

  Naumburg, December 1, 1867.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  I am a bombardier in the second mounted division of the Fourth Horse

Artillery.

  You may well imagine how astonished I was by this revolution in my

affairs, and what a violent upheaval it has made in my everyday humdrum

existence.  Nevertheless  I  have  borne  the  change  with  determination  and

courage, and even derive a certain pleasure from this turn of fortune. Now

that I have an opportunity of doing a little ????s??[22] I am more than ever

thankful to our Schopenhauer. For the first five weeks I had to be in the

stables. At 5:30 in the morning I had to be among the horses, removing the

manure and grooming the animals down with the currycomb and horse brush.

For the present my work lasts on an average from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from

11.30 a.m. to 6 p.m., the greater part of which I spend in parade drill. Four

times a week we two soldiers who are to serve for a year have to attend a

lecture  given  by  a  lieutenant,  to  prepare  us  for  the  reserve  officers

examination. You must know that in the horse artillery there is a tremendous

amount to learn. We get most fun out of the riding lessons. My horse is a

very fine animal, and I am supposed to have some talent for riding. When I

and my steed gallop round the large parade ground, I feel very contented with

my lot. On the whole, too, I am very well treated. Above all, we have a very

nice captain.

  I have now told you all about my life as a soldier. This is the reason why I

have kept you waiting so long for news and for an answer to your last letter.

Meanwhile, if I am not mistaken, you will probably have been freed from

your military fetters; that is why I thought it would be best to address this

letter to Spandau.

  But my time is already up; a business letter to Volkmann and another to

Ritschl have robbed me of much of it. So I must stop in order to get ready for

the parade in full kit.

  Well,  old  man,  forgive  my  long  neglect,  and  hold  the  god  of  War

responsible for most of it.

  Your devoted friend,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE,    Bombardier.

  To Rohde - February, 1868

  Naumburg, February 1-3, 1868.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  It is Saturday, and the day too is drawing to a close. For a soldier the

word "Saturday" is full of magic charm and of a feeling of quiet and peace of

which as a student I had no idea. To be able to sleep and dream peacefully,

without one's soul being taunted by the terrifying picture of the morrow; to

have  overcome  and  done  with  another  seven  days  of  that  excitement  in

uniform which is called a year's soldiering-what simple and at the same time

deep  joys  such  things  awaken-joys  worthy  of  a  cynic  and  attained  by  us

almost  too  cheaply  and  easily.  I  now  understand  that  first  and  greatest

Saturday afternoon mood, in which that easy and satisfied phrase p??ta ??a? ?

a??[23] was pronounced; in which coffee and a pipe were invented, and the

first optimist stepped into life. In any case, the Hebrews who concocted and

believed  this  beautiful  story  were  warriors  or  factory  hands;  they  were

certainly not students; for the latter would have proposed six days holiday

and one workday in the week, and in practice would have converted even this

into a holiday like the rest. At all events, that was my practice; and at the

present moment I feel the contrast between my present life and my former

scientific loafing very strongly indeed. If it were only possible to muster all

the philologists of ten years together and drill them army fashion into the

service of science, at the end of ten years the science of philology would no

longer be necessary, because all the principal work would have been done.

And, moreover, it would no longer be possible, because no man would join

these  colours  voluntarily,  colours  with  which  the  idea  of  the  "one-year

volunteer" cannot be associated at all.

  As you see, a Saturday makes one talkative, because we have to be silent

all the rest of the week and are accustomed to regulate the capacities of our

souls according to our superior officer's word of command. That is why on

Saturdays, when the eye of the master is removed, words gush forth from our

lips  and  sentences  pour  out  of  the  ink-pot-especially  when  the  fire  is

crackling in the grate and outside you hear the roar of a February storm,

heavy with the promise of Spring. Saturday, a storm, and a warm room-these

are the best ingredients with which to brew the punch of a "letter-writing

mood." . . .

  My present life, my dear friend, is really very lonely and friendless. Itoffers  me  no  stimulation  that  I  do  not  myself  provide;  none  of  that

harmonious concord of souls which many a happy hour in Leipzig used to

afford; but rather, enstrangement of the soul from itself, preponderance of

obsessional influences, which draw the soul up tightly with a sense of fear,

and teach it to regard things with an earnestness that they do not deserve.

This is the seamy side of my present existence, and you will certainly be able

to enter into my feelings about it. Let us, however, turn it round the other

way.  This  life  is  certainly  uncomfortable,  but  enjoyed  as  an  entremets,

absolutely useful. It makes a constant call on a man's energy and is relished

particularly as an ??t?d?t??[24] against paralyzing scepticism, concerning the

effects of which we have observed a good deal together. Moreover, it helps

one to become acquainted with one's own nature, as it reveals itself among

strange and generally rough people, without any assistance from science and

without that traditional goddess Fame which determines our worth for our

friends and for society. Up to the present I have remarked that people are well

disposed toward me, whether they happen to be captains or plain gunners; for

the rest I do my duty with zeal and interest. Is it not something to be proud of,

to be regarded as the best rider among thirty recruits? Verily, dear friend, that

is more than a philological prize, although I am not insensible even to the

kind of encomiums that the Faculty of Leipzig thought fit to bestow upon me.

. . .

  Ah, my dear friend, what a child of misfortune is a field artilleryman

when he has literary tastes into the bargain. Our old god of War loved young

women, not shrivelled old Muses. A gunner who often enough in his barrack

room sits upon a dirty stool meditating upon Democritean problems, while

his boots are being polished for him, is really a paradox on whom the gods

must look with scorn. . . .

  When I tell you that I am on duty every day from 7 in the morning to 5 in

the  evening,  and  that  in  addition  I  have  to  attend  lectures  given  by  a

lieutenant and a vet respectively, you can imagine what a sorry plight I am in.

At night the body is limp and tired and seeks its couch in good time. And so

it  goes  on  without  respite  or  rest,  day  after  day.  What  becomes  of  the

reflection and contemplation necessary for scientific cogitation in the midst

of it all? Even for things which are still more dear to me than my literary

needs, for the delights of a friendly correspondence and for art, I so seldom

have a free moment. Just let me be once more in full enjoyment of my time

and my strength-  Si male nunc, non olim sic erit.[25]

  And next year I go to Paris.

  Your devoted friend,

  FR. NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - February, 1868

  Naumburg, February 16, 1868.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  As I have already told you my military duties take up much of my time,

but they are on the whole tolerable. I am still particularly fond of riding, and

my zeal for it is kept alive by the praise I receive on all sides. From the

officers I hear that I have a good seat and thus make a good display. Believe

me, old man, I never thought I should have an opportunity of growing vain

about this sort of thing. Suffice it to say that my desire to perfect myself in

this fine but difficult art is very strong indeed. If you should happen to come

to Naumburg for the Pforta School Festival, you will be able to appreciate my

achievements. I am afraid you will have a good laugh when you see me

shouting my orders. But I still have a good deal to learn before I can pass the

officers exam.

  Yours,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - June, 1868

  Naumburg, June 22, 1868.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  Today all my comrades in arms have left me. They are on the way to

Magdeburg  for  gun  practice.  So  I  am  about  the  only  gay-coated  creature

within the walls of Naumburg-an abandoned broken-winged stork that with

envy in its heart has seen all its more powerful fellows fly right away. Yes,

old man, the rumour that has already reached you by many a tortuous path is

for the best (i.e., the worst) part true: I did not end my military career quite

happily.

  I had survived the winter and also the most difficult and unpleasant half

of my year's service; they had made me a bombardier and were well pleased

with my behaviour. When the fine weather came and I was able to ride my

horse round the huge parade ground I too was beginning to breathe more

freely. Towards the end I was riding the most restive and fiery animal in the

battery. One day I failed in attempting a smart spring into the saddle; I gave

my chest a blow on the pommel and felt a sharp rend in my left side. But Iquietly went on riding, and endured the increasing pain for a day and a half.

On the evening of the second day, however, I had two fainting fits, and on the

third day I lay as if nailed to my bed, suffering the most terrible agony and

with a high temperature. The doctors declared that I had torn two of the

muscles  of  my  chest.  In  consequence  of  this  the  whole  system  of  chest

muscles and ligaments was inflamed, and severe suppuration had supervened

owing to the bleeding of the torn tissues. A week later, when my chest was

lanced, several cupfuls of matter were removed. From that time onward, three

whole months, the suppuration has never ceased, and when at last I left my

bed,  I  was  naturally  so  exhausted  that  I  had  to  learn  to  walk  again.  My

condition was lamentable; I had to be helped in standing, walking and lying

down, and could not even write. Gradually my health improved, I enjoyed an

invigorating diet, took plenty of exercise and recovered my strength. But the

wound still remained open and the suppuration scarcely abated. At last it was

discovered that the sternum itself had been grazed and this was the obstacle

to recovery. One evening I got an undeniable proof of this, in the form of a

little piece of bone which came out of the wound with the matter. This has

happened frequently since, and the doctor says it is like to occur frequently

again. Should a large piece of bone be detached a slight operation would be

imperative. The trouble is by no means dangerous, but it is exceedingly slow.

The doctors can do nothing but help nature in her work of elimination and

fresh growth. In addition to this I make frequent injections of camomile tea

and  silver  nitrate  every  day  and  take  a  warm  bath.  Our  staff  doctor  will

shortly pronounce me "temporarily disabled," and it is not improbable that I

may always suffer from some weakness round about the wound.

  As soon as I was able to wield a pen again I plunged once more into my

studies, of which I send you a sample in the enclosed little Dance Song.

  Yours, F. N.

  To Frau Ritschl - July, 1868

    Wittekind, Beginning of July, 1868.

  DEAR FRAU RITSCHL:

  .  .  .  The  day  before  yesterday  at  noon  I  reached  the  pretentious  little

village spa called Wittekind. It was raining hard and the flags that had been

hung  out  for  the  spa  festival  were  looking  limp  and  dirty.  My  host,  an

unmistakable rogue with opaque blue spectacles, came forward to meet me

and conducted me to the apartment I had engaged six days before. Everything

about this room, including an absolutely mouldy sofa, was as desolate as aprison. I very soon realized too that this same host employed only one servant

maid for two houses full of visitors which probably means from twenty to

forty  people.  Before  the  first  hour  had  elapsed  I  had  a  visit,  but  so

disagreeable a one that I was only able to shake it off by means of the most

energetic courtesy. In short the whole atmosphere of the place I had just

entered was chilly, damp and disagreeable.

    Yesterday I took stock a bit of the place and its in habitants. At table I had

the  good  fortune  to  sit  near  a  deaf-and-dumb  man  and  a  number  of

extraordinary-shaped females. The place does not seem bad, but one can go

nowhere and see nothing owing to the rain and the damp. Volkmann called

and prescribed the local baths for me. He also spoke of an operation in the

near future.

  How grateful I am to you for having given me Ehlert's book.[26] I read it

on  the  first  evening  of  my  stay  reclining  on  the  mouldy  sofa  in  my

wretchedly lighted room, but it gave me much pleasure and inner warmth.

Unkind tongues might say the book is written in an agitated and inferior

style.  But  the  who  uses  his  eyes  in  art.  At  bottom  it  is  music  though  it

happens to be written not in notes but in words. A painter must experience

the  most  painful  sensations  on  beholding  all  this  confusion  of  images

crowded together without any method. But unfortunately I have a weakness

for the Paris feuilleton, for Heine's Reisebilder, etc., and prefer a stew to

roast-beef. What pains it has cost me to pull a scientific face in order to write

down a jejune train of thought with the requisite decency and alia breve.

Your husband can even sing a song about this (not to the tune it is true of

"Ach lieber Franz, noch"[27], etc.), for he was very much surprised at the

lack of "style." In the end I felt like the sailor who feels less secure on land

than in a rocking ship. But perhaps I shall one day discover a philological

theme that will permit of musical treatment, and then I shall splutter like a

suckling and heap up images like a barbarian who has fallen asleep before an

antique head of Venus, and still be in the right in spite of the "flourishing

speed"[28] of the exposition.

  And  Ehlert  is  almost  always  right.  But  to  many  men  truth  is

irrecognizable in this harlequin garb. To us who hold no page of life too

serious to allow of our sketching some joke in fleeting arabesque upon it, this

is not so. And which of the gods can feel any surprise if we occasionally

behave like satyrs and parody a life that always looks so serious and pathetic

and wears buskins?  If only I could manage to conceal my weakness for dissonance from you!

Answer me frankly have you not already a terrible sample of it? Here you

have  a  second.  Wagner's  and  Schopenhauer's  club  feet  are  difficult  to

conceal. But I shall improve. And if ever you should allow me to play you

something again, I shall embody my memory of that beautiful Sunday in

tones,  and  then  you  will  hear  what  you  only  read  today,  to  wit,  what  a

tremendous deal that memory means to a bad musician, etc.

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  Nauniburg, August 8, 1868.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  At last I can give you absolutely reliable news of my health and quite the

best you could wish to hear. A few days ago I returned quite recovered from

the baths at Wittekind, where I went in order to place myself in the able and

experienced hands of Prof. Volkmann, the distinguished Halle surgeon. My

regimental doctors were good and candid enough to advise me to consult this

specialist, and after three weeks of the Wittekind cure, the somewhat painful

healing process developed so favourably that Volkmann congratulated me

and said I should now recover very quickly. In the end an operation was not

necessary, although for a long while it had threatened to be so. Just think, old

man! five months illness, much tedious pain, profound bodily and spiritual

depression, and desperate prospects for the future-all this has been overcome!

All that remains to remind me of my dangerous condition is a single deep

scar over the bone in the middle of my chest. Volkmann told me that if the

suppuration had lasted much longer-as it was it lasted three months-my heart

or my lungs would probably have been affected.

  It is obvious that I cannot resume my military duties. I am pronounced

"temporarily disabled," and I hope, as I have been prevented from becoming

an officer of the Reserve, I shall contrive slowy and gradually to vanish from

the list of those liable to serve.

  Your devoted friend,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Rohde - October, 1868

  Naumburg, October 8, 1868.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  . . . Not long ago I was reading (and that at first hand) Jahn's Essays on

Music, as well as his essays on Wagner. A certain amount of enthusiasm isrequired to do justice to such a man, but Jahn shows instinctive repugnance

and listens with his ears half closed. Nevertheless I agree with him in many

respects, particularly when he says he regards Wagner as the representative of

a modern dilettantism which is sucking up and digesting all art interests. But

it is precisely from this point of view that one cannot cease wondering at the

magnitude  of  each  artistic  gift  in  this  man  and  his  inexhaustible  energy

coupled with such a versatility of artistic talent. For as to "culture", the more

variegated and extensive it happens to be, the more lifeless is usually the eye,

the weaker are the legs and the more effete are the brains that bear it.

  Wagner has, moreover, a range of feeling which lies far beyond Jahn's

reach. Jahn remains a "Grenzbote"[29] hero, a healthy man, to whom the

Tannhauser saga and the atmosphere of Lohengrin are a closed book. My

pleasure in Wagner is much the same as my pleasure in Schopenhauer-the

ethical air, the redolence of Faust, and also of the Cross-death and the tomb. .

  To Rohde - November, 1868

  Leipzig, November 9, 1868.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  Today I intend to relate a whole host of sprightly experiences, to look

merrily into the future and to conduct myself in such idyllic and easy fashion

that your sinister guest-that feline fever-will arch its back and retire spitting

and swearing. And in order that all discordant notes may be avoided I shall

discuss the famous res severa[30] which is responsible for your second letter

on a special sheet of paper, so that you will be able to read it when you are in

the right mood and place for it.

  The acts of my comedy are: (1) A Club-night or the Assistant Professor;

(2) The Ejected Tailor; (3) A Rendezvous with X. Some old women take part

in the performance. . . .

  At home I found two letters, yours and an invitation from Curtius, whom

I am glad to get to know better. When two friends like us write letters to each

other, it is well known that the angels rejoice. And they rejoiced as I read

your letter-aye, they even giggled. . . .

  When I reached home yesterday I found a card addressed to me with this

note upon it: "If you would like to meet Richard Wagner, come to the TheatreCafe at a quarter to four. Windisch".

  Forgive me, but this news so turned my head that I quite forgot what I

was doing before it came, and was thoroughly bewildered.

  I naturally ran there and found our loyal friend, who gave me a lot of

fresh information. Wagner was staying in Leipzig with his relations in the

strictest incognito. The press had no inkling of his visit and all Brockhaus's

servants  were  as  dumb  as  graves  in  livery.  Now  Wagner's  sister,  Frau

Brockhaus,  that  determined  and  clever  woman,  had  introduced  her  friend

Frau Ritschl to her brother, and on this occasion was able proudly to boast of

the friend to the brother and of the brother to the friend, the lucky creature!

Wagner  played  the  Meisterlied,  which  you  must  know,  in  Frau  Ritschl's

presence, and this good lady told him that she already knew the song very

well, mea opera.[31] Imagine Wagner's joy and surprise! And with the utmost

readiness in the world he graciously declared his willingness to meet me

incognito. I was to be invited on Friday evening. Windisch, however, pointed

out that I should be prevented from coming by my official post and duties,

Saturday afternoon was accordingly proposed. On that day Windisch and I

ran to the Brockhaus's, found the Professor's family but no Wagner. He had

just gone out with an enormous hat on his huge head. It was thus that I made

the acquaintance of the excellent family and received a kind invitation for

Sunday evening.

  On these days I felt as though I was living in a novel, and you must allow

that in view of the inaccessibility of the exceptional man, the circumstances

leading up to this acquaintance were somewhat romantic.

  As I was under the impression that a large company of guests had been

invited, I decided to dress very ceremoniously, and was glad that my tailor

had promised to deliver a new dress suit for this very evening. It was a horrid

day with constant showers of rain and snow. One shuddered at the thought of

leaving the house, and I was therefore very pleased when little Roscher paid

me a visit in the afternoon to tell me something about the Eleatics and about

God  in  philosophy-for,  as  candidandus  he  is  working  up  the  material

collected by Ahrens in his "Development of the Idea of God up to the Time

of Aristotle" while Romundt is trying for the prize essay of the University,

the subject of which is "On the Will". It was getting dark, the tailor did not

turn up, and Roscher left me. I accompanied him, called on the tailor myself,

and found his minions busily engaged on my clothes, which they promised to

send round in three-quarters of an hour.  I went on my way in a jolly mood, looked in at Kintschy's, read the

Kladderadatsch, and was amused to find a paragraph saying that Wagner was

in Switzerland and that a fine house was being built for him in Munich, while

I knew all the time that I was going to see him that evening and that the day

before he had received a letter from the little monarch[32] addressed to "The

Great German Tone-poet, Richard Wagner."

  But at home there was no tailor awaiting me, so I sat down and read the

treatise on the Eudokia at my ease, but was constantly disturbed by the sound

of a shrill bell that seemed to be ringing some distance away. At last I felt

certain that someone was stand ing at the old iron gate; it was shut, as was

also the door of the house. I shouted across the garden to the man to enter the

house; but it was impossible to make oneself understood through the pouring

rain. The whole house was disturbed, the door was ultimately opened, and a

little old man bearing a parcel came up to me. It was half-past 6, time for me

to dress and get ready, as I lived a long way off. It was all right, the man had

my  things.  I  tried  them  on  and  they  fitted.  But  what  was  this  suspicious

development? He actually presented me with a bill. I took it politely, but he

declared he must be paid on delivery. I was surprised, and explained that I

had nothing to do with him as the servant of my tailor, but that my dealings

were with his master to whom I had given the order. The man grew more

pressing, as did also the time. I snatched at the things and began to put them

on. He snatched them too and did all he could to prevent me from dressing.

What with violence on my part and violence on his, there was soon a scene,

and all the time I was fighting in my shirt, as I wished to get the new trousers.

  At last, after a display of dignity, solemn threats, the utterance of curses

on  my  tailor  and  his  accomplice,  and  vows  of  vengeance,  the  little  man

vanished  with  my  clothes.  End  of  the  First  Act.  I  sat  on  my  sofa  and

meditated while I examined a black coat and wondered whether it was good

enough for Richard.

  Outside the rain continued to pour.

  It was a quarter past 7. I had promised to meet Windisch at half-past 7 at

the Theatre Cafe. I plunged into the dark and rainy night, also a little man in

black and without evening dress, yet in a beatific mood, for chance was in my

favour-even  the  scene  with  the  tailor's  man  had  something  tremendously

unusual about it.

  At last we entered Frau Brockhaus's exceedingly comfortable drawing-

room.  There  was  nobody  there  except  the  most  intimate  members  of  thefamily, Richard and us two. I was introduced to Wagner and muttered a few

respectful words to him. He questioned me closely as to how I had become so

well acquainted with his music, complained bitterly about the way his operas

were produced with the exception of the famous Munich performances, and

made great fun of the conductors who tried to encourage their orchestra in

friendly tones as follows: "Now, gentlemen, let's have some passion! My

good  people,  still  a  little  more  passion  if  you  please!"  Wagner  enjoys

imitating the Leipzig dialect.

  Now let me give you a brief account of all that happened that evening.

Really the joys were of such a rare and stimulating kind that even today I am

not back in the old groove, but can think of nothing better to do than come to

you, my dear friend, to tell you these wonderful tidings. Wagner played to us

before and after supper, and went through every one of the more important

passages of the Meistersinger. He imitated all the voices and was in very high

spirits.  He  is,  by  the  bye,  an  extraordinarily  energetic  and  fiery  man.  He

speaks very quickly and wittily, and can keep a private company of the sort

assembled on that evening very jolly. I managed to have quite a long talk

with him about Schopenhauer. Oh, and you can imagine what a joy it was for

me to hear him speak with such indescribable warmth of our master-what a

lot we owed to him, how he was the only philosopher who had understood

the  essence  of  music!  Then  he  inquired  as  to  how  the  professors  were

disposed toward him; laughed a good deal about the Philosophers Congress at

Prague, and spoke of them as philosophical footmen. Later on he read me a

piece out of the autobiography he is now writing, a thoroughly amusing scene

from his Leipzig student days which I still cannot recall without a laugh. He

writes extraordinarily cleverly and intellectually. At the close of the evening,

when we were both ready to go, he shook my hand very warmly and kindly

asked  me  to  come  and  see  him  so  that  we  might  have  some  music  and

philosophy together. He also entrusted me with the task of making his music

known to his sister and his relations, a duty which I undertook very solemnly

to fulfil. You will hear more about it when I have succeeded in looking at this

evening more objectively and from a greater distance. For the time being a

hearty farewell and best wishes for your health from yours,

  To Rohde - November, 1868

  Leipzig on the Day of Penance,

    November 20, 1868.  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  Now that I can once more contemplate the teeming brood of philologists

of our day at close quarters; now that I am obliged daily to observe the whole

of their mole-hill activity, their swollen cheek pouches, their blind eyes, their

rejoicing over the captured worm and their indifference towards the true-nay,

the obvious-problems of life, and remember that I notice these characteristics

not only in the young brood, but also in their venerable elders, I grow ever

more clearly convinced that we two, if we wish to remain true to our genius,

will not be able to pursue our life task without causing much offence, and

being constantly thwarted and crossed in our purpose. When the philologist

and the man are not of one piece, the whole tribe above mentioned gapes in

astonishment at the miracle; it grows angry and finally scratches, growls, and

bites. You have just experienced an example of this. For of this I am quite

certain, that the trick you have been played was not directed at your work in

particular, but at your individuality. And I, too, live in hope of having very

soon a foretaste of what awaits me in this infernal atmosphere. But, my good

man, what have the judgments of other people concerning our personalities to

do  with  our  achievements?  Let  us  remember  Schopenhauer  and  Richard

Wagner, and the inexhaustible energy with which they maintained their belief

in themselves in the face of protests from the whole of the "cultured" world,

and even if we are not allowed to refer them to deos maximos[33] we still

have  the  consolation  of  knowing  that  however  odd  one  is  one  cannot  be

denied the right to existence, and that two such odd creatures as ourselves

who  understand  each  other  so  well  and  are  so  deeply  united  must  be  a

delightful spectacle for the gods.

  Finally, nothing could be more regrettable than the fact that precisely at

this moment, when we have just begun to put our views of life to a practical

test, and explore all things and all circumstances in turn-men, states, studies,

world  histories,  churches,  schools,  etc.-with  our  antennae,  we  should  be

separated by miles of territory, and each should be left alone with the semi-

enjoyable and semi-painful feeling of having to digest his outlook on the

world  in  solitude.  As  a  matter  of  fact  nothing  would  have  been  more

exhilarating than to sit down together now, as we used to do, to digest our

bodily meals together at Kintschy's, and symbolically drink our afternoon

coffee in company, and, from this midday of our lives, glance backwards into

the past and forwards into the future.

    However, it will not be too late to do this even in Paris, where the great ??a???f?s??[34] of our comedy takes place, and upon the most beautiful scene

in  the  world,  too,  between  the  most  brilliant  wings  and  in  numerable

glittering supers.

  Oh, how lovely this image is!

  Therefore avaunt unadorned reality, shamefully vulgar empiricism, credit

and  debit,  and  "Grenzboten"  sobriety!-no,  let  the  whole  of  this  letter  be

presented to my friend, with all my soul, as a solemn and lofty greeting!

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - April, 1869

  Naumburg, April 13, 1869.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  My hour has come and this is the last evening I shall spend at home for

some time. Early tomorrow morning I go out into the wide, wide world, to

enter a new and untried profession, in an atmosphere heavy and oppressive

with duty and work. Once more I must take leave of everything, the golden

time of free and unconstrained activity, in which every instant is sovereign, in

which  the  joys  of  art  and  the  world  are  spread  out  before  us  as  a  mere

spectacle in which we scarcely participate. This time is now for ever in the

past  for  me.  Now  the  inexorable  goddess  "Daily  Duty"  rules  supreme.

"Bemooster Bursche zieh? ich aus!" [36] [As a moss-grown student I go out

into the world.] But you know that touching student song of course! "Muss

selber nun Philister sein!" [37] [I too must be a Philistine now.] In one way or

another this line always comes true. One cannot take up posts and honours

with impunity the only question is, are the fetters of iron or of thread? For I

have the pluck which will one day perhaps enable me to burst my bonds and

venture into this precarious life from a different direction and in a different

way. As yet I see no sign of the inevitable humpback of the professor. May

Zeus and all the Muses preserve me from ever becoming a Philistine, an ??

df?p??[38], a man of the herd. But I do not know how I could become one,

seeing that I am not one. It is true I stand a little nearer to another kind of

Philistine-the Philistine of the "specialist" species; for it is only natural that

the daily task, and the unremitting concentration of the mind upon certain

specified subjects and problems, should tend to abate the free receptivity ofthe mind and undermine the philosophic sense. But I flatter myself that I shall

be able to meet this danger with more calm and assurance than the majority

of philologists. Philosophical seriousness is already too deeply rooted in me;

the true and essential problems of life and thought have been too clearly

revealed to me by that great mystagogue, Schopenhauer, to allow of my ever

being obliged to dread such a disgraceful defection from the "Idea". To infuse

this  new  blood  into  my  science,  to  communicate  to  my  pupils  that

Schopenhauerian earnestness which is stamped on the brow of the sublime

man-such  is  my  desire,  such  is  my  undaunted  hope.  I  should  like  to  be

something  more  than  a  mere  trainer  of  efficient  philologists.  The  present

generation of teachers, the care of the coming generation-all this is in my

mind. If we must live our lives out to the bitter end let us at least do so in

such wise that others may bless our life as a priceless treasure, once we have

been happily released from its tolls.

  As for you, old man, with whom I agree on such a number of vital and

fundamental questions, I wish you the luck you deserve and myself your old

and tried friendship. Fare thee well!

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, DR.

  To Rohde - August, 1869

    Badenweiler, August 17, 1869.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  This is the last day of the holidays. Feelings long since dead and buried

seem to wake again. I feel just like a fourth-form boy who waxes sentimental

and writes poems about the ephemeral character of earthly happiness when he

hears the clock strike on the last day of the holidays. Oh, dear friend, what a

small amount of joy is mine and what a lot of my own smoke I have to

consume! Aye, I wouldn't fear even an attack of that dreadful dysentery if by

means  of  it  I  could  purchase  a  talk  with  you  every  evening.  How

unsatisfactory letters are! Incidentally I discovered the following beautiful

passage in old Goethe yesterday:

  "How precious is the dear and certain speech

  Of the present friend! The Solitary,

  Robbed of its power benign, sinks into gloom;

  Too slowly ripens, then locked in his breast,

  Thought and each firm resolve ; but in the presence

  Of the beloved friend they leap to life!"[39]

  You see, that's the whole thing: we are in eternal need of midwives, andwith the view of being confined most men go into the public house or to a

"colleague," and then the little thoughts and little plans romp out like kittens.

When, however, we are pregnant and there is no one at hand to assist us in

our difficult delivery, then darkly and gloomily we lay our rude, unformed,

newborn  thought  in  the  murky  recess  of  some  cave;  the  sunny  rays  of

friendship are denied it.

  But with my incessant talk about solitude, I shall soon develop into a

regular Joseph, the carpenter, and then no kind Mary will wish to join her lot

with mine. "The calf and the baby ass, men say, do praise the Lord most

perfectly." There s the whole thing! A little cattle makes the whole world kin,

the edifice is crowned. Remember it was the shepherds and the sheep who

saw the stars; to people like us everything is dark. . . .

  Now let me tell you something about my Jupiter, Richard Wagner, to

whom  I  go  from  time  to  time  for  a  breath  of  air,  and  receive  more

refreshment by so doing than any of my colleagues could possibly imagine.

The fellow has not received a single honour yet, and has only just had the

distinction of being elected honorary member of the Berlin Academy of Arts.

A fruitful, rich and convulsive life, distinctly unheard of and deviating from

the average standard of morals. But that is precisely why he stands there,

firmly rooted in his own power, with his eyes always scanning a distance

beyond everything ephemeral, and beyond his age in the finest sense. Not

long  ago  he  handed  me  the  MS.  of  "State  and  Religion,"  intended  as  a

memoire for the young King of Bavaria. It is conceived on such a high plane,

is  so  independent  of  time,  and  so  full  of  nobility  and  Schopenhauerian

earnestness that it made me feel I should like to be a king in order to receive

such  exhortations.  By-the-bye,  a  little  while  ago  I  sent  him  one  or  two

passages out of your letters for Frau von B�low, who had often asked me for

them. On my last visit but one a baby boy was born during the night and was

called "Siegfried." The last time I was there Wagner had just completed the

composition of his Siegfried, and was full of the exuberance of his power.

Aren't you going to write to him? Perhaps you think he has more than enough

lay  admirers.  But  do  not  write  as  a  musician;  write  as  a  man  who  is  in

sympathy with his thoughts and is as earnest as he is. He very rarely gets a

sign of this sort, and every time he does happen to he is as delighted as if he

had had a windfall. . . .

    Farewell, my dear, true friend.

    FRIED. NIETZSCHE.  Nietzsche To His Mother - August, 1869

  Bale, Monday Evening, August 30, 1869.

  DEAR MOTHER:

  I  have  just  returned  from  an  exceedingly  enjoyable  and  harmonically

happy visit of two days to my friend Wagner and am reminded that I owe you

an answer as well as thanks for two letters. Above all I am delighted to hear

that you are sure to come in the autumn, but you have formed an exaggerated

opinion of the all too modest space at my disposal in my new quarters if you

think I shall be able to put you both up. I shall however do my best to make

arrangements for you to live quite close to me, perhaps even in the same

house. This would be quite possible if my colleague Sch�nberg moves, as he

intends to do, at the right time. Then his rooms would be free. We are now

very busy again and regularly so. As soon as the term is over and I am quite

free, I think we shall make our way together to the charming Lake of Geneva

and  eat  as  many  grapes  as  we  like,  but  not  medicinally  like  the  Grand-

duchess.[40]

  As you seem to be interested in her meeting with me, I must add that it

made quite a favourable impression upon me. She seems to have received a

sound  and  liberal  education;  she  shows  marked  signs  of  having  a  good

intellect  and  an  earnest  grasp  of  life,  which  is  certainly  not  rare  in  royal

personages  and  is  quite  comprehensible  in  view  of  the  burdens  of  their

position. She has moreover a friendly, accessible and engaging manner, and

does  not  suffer  from  a  desire  to  be  constantly  standing  on  ceremony.  I

received her as you suggested. I met her at the railway station with a bouquet,

escorted her on foot across the Rhine bridge and then as far as her hotel in a

carriage. I then had dinner with her and her suite-she has engaged 21 rooms.

So I was in her company in all about two or three hours and for a good part of

that time alone with her. During that time she told me a good deal about old

days and recent ones as well; for instance, a lot about you, how Lizzie had

grown so thin at Leipzig, and whether she drank cow's milk now, etc., etc.

The ladies in waiting were also quite attentive to me and proved kind and

cheerful creatures. One is at a great advantage when one's attitude towards

royal personages is quite independent and one has no requests or appeals to

lay before them. Why did Lizzie tremble so on the occasion of her first visit

and  behave  in  such  a  nervous  way?  I  would  not  say  that  I  had  been

embarrassed by the whole affair, but I regretted the time lost.

  The Grand-duchess revealed a strong taste for music and thought over theproximity of Tribschen and Richard Wagner a good deal. She asked me to

convey to him her deep regard for his work.

  Never  have  I  been  happier  than  during  the  last  few  days.  The  warm,

hearty  and  increasing  intimacy  with  Wagner  and  Fran  von  Billow,  the

complete agreement between us on all the questions that chiefly interest us,

Wagner absolutely in the prime of his genius and marvellous creations only

just  come  into  being,  glorious  Tribschen  arranged  on  such  a  regal  and

ingenious scale-many things conspire to exhilarate me and strengthen me in

my calling.

  Good-bye!

  F. N.

  To Rohde - February, 1870

  Bale, End of January to February 15, 1870.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  I suddenly began to feel anxious the other day. I am wondering how you

are getting on in Rome, and thinking how remote from the world and isolated

your life there must be. You may even be ill and are receiving no proper care

and  no  friendly  support.  Set  my  fears  at  rest  and  dispel  my  pessimistic

fancies.  I  always  imagine  Rome  of  the  Christian  Councils  as  a  terribly

poisonous place-no, I shall not write any more; for I have a feeling that the

secrecy of a letter is not sufficiently secure for the discussion of ecclesiastical

and Jesuitical matters. They might scent what the contents of the letter were,

and pay you out for it. You are studying antiquity and leading the life of the

Middle Ages.

  Now let me impress this upon you most emphatically-don't forget on your

return journey to come and spend some time with me. Perhaps, you know, it

might be the last time for many years. I miss you terribly, so give me the

comfort of your presence and try to make your stay not too short a one. For it

is indeed a new experience for me to have no one on the spot to whom I can

tell all the best and the worst that life brings me-not even a really sympathetic

colleague. In such anchoritic conditions and with such difficult years in a

young life, my friendship is actually becoming something pathological. I beg

you, as an invalid begs : "Come to Bale!"

  My real refuge, which cannot be valued too highly, is still Triebschen,

near Lucerne. The only thing is I can but seldom have recourse to it. I spent

my  Christmas  holidays  there,  most  beautiful  and  uplifting  memory!  It  is

absolutely necessary that you too should be initiated into this magic. Whenonce you are my guest we shall go and visit our friend Wagner together. Can't

you tell me anything about Franz Liszt? If you could possibly manage to

come home via Lake Como you would have a fine opportunity of giving us

all great pleasure. We, i.e., we Triebschen folk, have our eye on a villa on the

lake  near  Fiume  Latte.  It  is  called  "Valla  Capuana,"  and  consists  of  two

houses. Could you manage to inspect this villa and give us the benefit of your

opinion? . . .

  I  have  delivered  a  lecture  on  "The  Ancient  Musical  Drama"  before  a

mixed audience, and on Feb. 1st. I shall deliver a second on "Socrates and

Tragedy." Every day I get to like the Hellenic world more and more. There is

no better way of approaching close to it than that of indefatigably cultivating

one's own little self. The degree of culture I have attained consists in a most

mortifying admission of my own ignorance. The life of a philologist striving

in every direction of criticism and yet a thousand miles away from Greek

antiquity becomes every day more impossible to me. I even doubt whether I

shall  ever  succeed  in  becoming  a  proper  philologist.  If  I  cannot  succeed

incidentally, as it were, I shall never succeed. The trouble of it is that I have

no example and am in the dangerous position of the fool who acts on his own

responsibility. My plan for the immediate future is four years of work in

cultivating myself and then a year of travel, in your company perhaps. Our

life  is  really  a  very  difficult  one.  Sweet  ignorance  led  by  teachers  and

traditions was so blissfully secure.

  Moreover you will be well-advised not to choose a small University in

which to settle down. One is isolated even in one's science. What would I not

give for you and me to be able to live together! I am almost forgetting how to

speak.  But  the  most  irksome  feature  of  my  life  is  that  I  must  always  be

impersonating or representing somebody, either the teacher, the philologist,

or the man, and that I have always to begin by proving my mettle to all whom

I frequent. I am, however, a very bad hand at this, and get steadily worse as

time goes on. I either remain dumb or intentionally only say as much as a

polite man of the world is expected to say. In short, I am more dissatisfied

with myself than with the world, and feel therefore all the more attached to

the dearest of friends.

  Farewell! Farewell!

  Sulz,  near  Weissenburg,  in  the  Neighbourhood  of  Worth,  August  28,

1870.  TO BEGIN WITH, HEARTY GREETINGS:

  We have already been two days on the journey from Erlangen: it takes

longer than one thinks, although we lay claim to every means of conveyance

to  hand,  and  entered  France,  for  instance,  sitting  on  the  breaks  of  an

enormous  supply  train.  Yesterday,  on  a  march  lasting  eleven  hours,  we

performed our errands at Gorsdorf and Langensulzbach, and on the battlefield

of Worth. Under separate cover I am sending you a souvenir of the terribly

devastated  battlefield,  strewn  with  countless  sad  remains  and  smelling

strongly of corpses. Today we want to go to Hagenau, tomorrow to Nancy,

and  so  on,  in  the  direction  of  the  Southern  Army.  Mosengel  and  I  are

travelling alone and shall only rejoin Ziemssen, our Erlangen colleague, at

Pont-�-Mousson.

  No letters from you can possibly reach me for the next few weeks, as we

are constantly changing our position, and the letter post is exceedingly slow.

Nothing can be gleaned here of the progress of our army, all papers having

completely ceased. The enemy population here seems to be growing used to

the new state of affairs. But of course it should be remembered that they are

threatened with death for the smallest offence.

  In all the villages through which we have passed one sees hospital after

hospital.

  I shall soon send you further news. Don't be in the least anxious on my

account.

  YOUR FRITZ.

    Erlangen, September 11, 1870.

  Hotel Walfisch.

    DEAREST MOTHER:

  Just think-until now I have had no news of you, but my campaign has

already come to an end without mishap. Not quite without mishap, perhaps,

for I am lying here suffering from severe dysentery: but the worst symptoms

are  over[41]  and  on  Tuesday  or  Wednesday  I  shall  be  able  to  travel  to

Naumburg to be nursed back to health again. And now as regards this, I

should like you and Lizzie, if you possibly can, to return to Naumburg. What

with my longing for peace and quiet and the exhausted state I am in, there is

no other place to which I should like to go. I went as far as the outskirts of

Metz and conducted a transport of wounded from there to Carlsruhe. And as

the  result  of  this,  the  terrible  state  of  all  the  wounded  in  my  hands,  theconstant bandaging of their septic wounds, and sleeping in a cattle truck in

which  six  severely  wounded  men  lay  on  straw,  I  contracted  the  germ  of

dysentery. The doctor discovered that I was suffering from diphtheria as well,

which is also the outcome of this journey. This is another of the evils we are

combating with the utmost vigour.

  In spite of it all I am glad at least to have been able to help a little in the

midst of all the incredible misery. And I should have returned to my duties

immediately if illness had not made this impossible.

  With heartiest greetings and wishes,

  Naumburg, September 21, 1870.

  DEAR SIR:

  Who can tell whether you have received my last letters! This is the secret

qualm which at such times as these seizes every letter writer. That is why I

will tell you once again that in the service of the voluntary ambulance corps I

went from Erlangen to the seat of war as far as Ars-sur-Moselle (quite close

to Metz), and that I brought a transport of wounded from there to Carlsruhe.

The  strain  of  the  whole  undertaking  was  considerable  and  I  am  still

struggling against the recollection of all I saw during those weeks, as well as

against an incessant wail of which I cannot rid my mind's ear. On my return I

was laid up with two dangerous diseases caught from the seriously wounded

men I had nursed unremittingly for all those days and nights diphtheria and

dysentery alas! nobile par fratrum![42]

    However, I have got over the worst of both these maladies. A few days

ago I arrived here in Naumburg with the view of recuperating thoroughly and

of recovering by means of peaceful work from the stress and fatigue I had

undergone. It is a funny thing that in spite of one's best intentions for the

general  weal  one's  own  paltry  personality  with  all  its  wretchedness  and

weakness comes and trips one up. Once more, alas!

  I hope shortly to be able to give you an account of my experiences in

person, and I am also bringing you one or two chassepot bullets picked up on

the battlefields. All my martial passions have been kindled once more and I

have been unable to gratify them. Had I joined my battery I might have been

an active or passive witness of the events at Rezonville, Sedan and Laon. But

the neutrality of Switzerland tied my hands.  . . . But when have we been able to walk more proudly than at present?

Surely  when  German  meets  German  now  they  can  laugh  as  well  as  cry

together like two augurs!

  And this we shall do together next week. Au revoir!

  Your devoted,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  This  morning  I  had  a  most  pleasant  surprise  and  release  from  much

anxiety and uneasiness-your letter. Only the day before yesterday I received

the most terrible shock on hearing your name pronounced in faltering accents

at  Pforta.  You  know  what  these  faltering  accents  mean  just  now.  I

immediately begged the Rector to give me the list of old Pforta boys who had

fallen in the war, and this document reached me yesterday evening. In one

important respect it reassured me. Otherwise it was a sad record. In addition

to  the  names  you  have  already  mentioned,  I  find  at  the  head  of  the  list

Stockert, then Von Oertzen (though his name has a question mark against it),

then Von Riedesel, etc., sixteen in all. I was deeply moved by all you told

me, above all by the sincerity and gravity with which you speak of the trial

by fire to which the philosophy we hold in common has been subjected. I,

too, have had a similar experience, and in my case, as well, these months

have been a period during which I have been able to prove how deep and firm

are the roots our fundamental doctrine has struck in me. One can die with it-

this is much more than saying that one can live with it. For I have not been so

securely removed from the dangers of the war as you might imagine. As soon

as it was declared I applied to my Governing Board for leave to discharge my

duty as a German soldier. They granted me leave but stipulated that in view

of Switzerland's neutrality I was on no account to bear arms. (Since 1869 I

have ceased to be a Prussian citizen.) With out delay, therefore, I set out with

an  excellent  friend  with  the  object  of  offering  myself  as  a  volunteer

ambulance attendant. This friend, who shared all my experiences for seven

weeks, is the painter Mosengel of Hamburg, a man whom I must introduce to

you  as  soon  as  peace  is  restored.  Without  his  hearty  assistance  I  should

probably not have survived the events of this period. At Erlangen I attended

the University lectures in order to be trained in medicine and surgery; we had

200 wounded there. In a very few days I was given charge of two Prussiansand two Turcos. Two of these very soon contracted hospital gangrene, and I

had to do a lot of painting. At the end of a fortnight Mosengel and I were sent

out by a Red Cross Society there. We were intrusted with a host of personal

messages and also with large sums of money to be handed to about eighty

field chaplains already dispatched to the seat of war. Our plan was to join my

colleague Ziemssen at Pont-�-Mousson, and to throw in our lot with his

band of fifteen young men. As a matter of fact, however, this plan was not

realized.  We  met  with  great  difficulties  in  discharging  our  various

commissions, for, as we had no addresses, we were obliged, at considerable

pains and with only the most inadequate directions to guide us, to go from

battlefield to battlefield and scour the hospitals of Weissenburg and the field

hospitals of Worth, Hagenau, Luneville, and Nancy, all the way to Metz. At

Ars-sur-Moselle a number of wounded soldiers were placed in our care, and

as they had to be conveyed to Carlsruhe, we returned with them. I had charge

of six very seriously wounded men singlehanded for three days and three

nights; Mosengel had five. The weather was atrocious and the goods trucks

we were in had to be almost closed up to prevent the poor invalids from

getting soaked through. The air in these trucks was simply unspeakable and

to  make  matters  worse  two  of  my  patients  had  dysentery  and  two  others

diphtheria. In short I had an incredible amount to do and spent three hours in

the morning and three at night dressing wounds alone. In addition to that, I

could get no rest at night owing to my patients continual need of me. After I

had delivered up my charges to a stationary hospital I fell very ill myself and

quickly  developed  a  severe  attack  of  dysentery  and  diphtheria.  I  reached

Erlangen  with  great  difficulty  and  there  I  laid  up.  Mosengel  was  self-

sacrificing enough to nurse me there-a no small under taking considering the

nature of my malady. After I had been dosed with opium and injections of

tannin and silver nitrate for several days, the worst danger was over. In a

week I was able to travel to Naumburg, but I am not right yet. Besides, the

atmosphere of my experiences had spread like a gloomy mist all about me,

and for some time I never ceased to hear the plaintive cries of the wounded. It

was therefore quite impossible to pursue my plan of returning to the seat of

war, and now I must be content with watching and pitying from a distance.

  Oh, my dear friend, what good wishes can I send you! We both know

what we have to expect from life. But we must not live for ourselves alone.

So live on! live on! dearest friend, and fare you well! I know your heroic

nature. Oh, if only you could be spared to me!  Your devoted friend,

  in Bale for good).

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - November, 1870

  Bale, November 7, 1870.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

    Yesterday I had a treat which I should have liked you of all people to

share. Jacob Burckhardt[43] gave a free lecture on "Historical Greatness,"

which was quite in keeping with our thought and feeling. This exceedingly

original old man, although not given to distortion, is yet inclined to hush up

the  truth.  But  on  our  confidential  walks  he  calls  Schopenhauer  "our

philosopher." Every week I attend one of his lectures on the Study of History,

and  I  believe  I  am  the  only  one  of  his  sixty  listeners  who  grasps  the

profundity of his line of thought with its curious breaks and twists at any

point where the subject threatens to be come dangerous. For the first time in

my life I have enjoyed a lecture, but then it was the sort of one I myself might

give when I am older.

  This  summer  I  wrote  an  essay  on  the  "Dionysian  Weltanschauung"

dealing  with  an  aspect  of  Greek  antiquity  of  which,  thanks  to  our

philosopher, we are now able to get a much closer view. But these are studies

which, for the time being only, concern me. I have no greater wish than to be

allowed  sufficient  time  to  mature  properly  and  then  out  of  my  plenitude

produce something.

  As regards the conditions of culture in the immediate future, I feel the

deepest misgivings. If only we are not forced to pay too dearly for this huge

national  success  in  a  quarter  where  I  at  least  refuse  to  suffer  any  loss.

Between  ourselves,  I  regard  the  Prussia  of  today  as  a  power  full  of  the

greatest  dangers  for  culture.  One  day  I  shall  myself  publicly  expose  our

scholastic  organization;  as  to  the  religious  intrigues  which  are  once  more

spreading from Berlin to the advantage of the Catholic Church I leave that to

others! At times it is very hard, but we must be philosophical enough to keep

our presence of mind in the midst of all this intoxication, so that no thief may

come to rob or steal from us-what the greatest military feats or the highest

national exaltation would in my opinion never replace.

  Much fighting will be necessary for the coming period of culture, and for

this work we must keep our selves in readiness. Dear friend, I always think of

you with the deepest apprehension. May the genius of the future guide and

guard you in the way we desire.  Your devoted friend,

  FR. NIETZSCHE.

  To His Mother And Sister - December, 1870

  Bale, December 12, 1870.

  DEAR MAMMA AND LIZZIE:

  . . . I am gradually losing all sympathy for Germany's present war of

conquest. The future of German culture seems to me now more in danger

than it ever was. . . .

  With heartiest greetings,

  YOUR FRITZ.

  To Rohde - December, 1870

  Bale, December 15, 1870.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  I have not allowed a minute to elapse since reading your letter but am

replying at once. I simply wanted to tell you that I felt just as you do and

would regard it as a disgrace if we could not get out of this state of longing

thirst  by  means  of  some  energetic  deed.  Now  listen  to  what  I  have  been

turning  over  in  my  soul!  Let  us  drag  on  for  another  year  or  two  in  this

University life! Let us accept it as an instructive burden of sorrow which we

are obliged to bear earnestly and with surprise. Among other things it will be

a period of probation for the art of teaching, by means of which I regard it as

my mission to perfect myself. The only thing is I have set my goal a little

higher.

  In the long run I have become aware of the importance of Schopenhauer's

teaching  about  the  wisdom  of  the  Universities.  A  thoroughly  radically

truthful existence is impossible here. But what is specially important is that

nothing truly subversive can ever emerge from this quarter.

  And then we can only become genuine teachers by straining every nerve

to raise ourselves out of the atmosphere of these times and by being not only

wiser but above all better men. Here also I feel that the very first prerequisite

is  to  be  true.  And  that  is  why,  I  repeat,  I  cannot  endure  this  academic

atmosphere too long.

  So it comes to this, we shall sooner or later cast off this yoke-upon this I

am firmly resolved. And then we shall form a new Greek Academy-Romundt

will certainly join us in that. Thanks to your visits to Triebschen you must

also know Wagner's Bayreuth plan. I have been considering quite privately

whether  we  on  our  part  should  not  simultaneously  effect  a  breach  withphilology as it has been practised hitherto and its aspect of culture. I am

preparing an important adhortatio[44] to all those natures that have not been

completely stifled and entangled in the present age. What a deplorable thing

it is that I should have to write to you about these matters and that each

individual thought should not have been discussed with you long ago! For,

since you do not know the whole apparatus as it already exists, my plan will

seem to you like an eccentric whim. But this it is not-it is a need.

  A book of Wagner's about Beethoven that has just been published you

will find full of suggestions about what I desire for the future. Read it; it is a

revelation of the spirit in which we-we!-shall live in the future.

  Even supposing we get but few adherents, I believe, nevertheless, that we

shall be able to extricate our selves pretty well-not without some injuries, it is

true-from this current, and that we shall reach some islet upon which we shall

no longer require to stop up our ears with wax. We shall then be our own

mutual teachers and our books will only be so much bait wherewith to lure

others to our monastic and artistic association. Our lives, our work, and our

enjoyment will then be for one another; possibly this is the only way in which

we can work for the world as a whole. In order to prove to you how deeply in

earnest I am in this matter, I have already begun to limit my requirements in

order to be able to preserve a small vestige of private means. We shall also

try our luck in lotteries; and, if we write books, I shall for the immediate

future demand the highest possible fees. In short, we shall make use of every

legitimate means in order to establish our monastery upon a secure material

basis thus, even for the next few years, we have our appointed tasks.

  If  only  this  plan  would  strike  you  as  being  at  least  worthy  of

consideration! That it was high time to lay it before you is proved by the

really stirring letter I have just received from you.

  Ought we not to be able to introduce a new form of the Academy life into

the world-

  "And would my powerful longings, all in vain

  Charm into life that deathless form again-"[45]

  -as Faust says of Helen?

  Nobody knows anything about this project, and whether we shall now

send a preliminary communication about it to Romundt will depend upon

you. Our school of philosophy is surely not an historical reminiscence or a

deliberate whim-does not dire necessity impel us in this direction?

    Apparently the plan we made as students to travel together has returned ina new and symbolically grander form. I will not again be the culprit who, as

on that occasion, left you in the lurch. I have not yet ceased to be vexed about

that.

  With the best of hopes,

  Your devoted

  FRATER FRIDERICUS.

  To Rohde - January, 1872

  Bale, January 28, 1872.

  MY VERY DEAR FRIEND:

  The other day I was approached, through Susemihl, and asked whether I

would accept a professorship at Greifswald. But I refused it immediately in

your favour and recommended you for the post. Has the matter developed

any further? I referred it to Ribbeck. Of course, the thing got to be known

here and was the means of my earning much sympathy from the good folk of

Bale.  Although  I  protested  that  it  was  not  actually  the  offer  of  an

appointment, but only a provisional inquiry, all the students decided to have a

torchlight procession in my honour, declaring that they wished to express

how much they valued and esteemed my past work in Bale. But I declined to

accept this demonstration. I am now holding a course of lectures here on

"The  Future  of  our  Educational  Institutions,"[46]  and  am  making  quite  a

sensation and even at times provoking genuine enthusiasm. Why do we not

live together, for all that now surges in my breast and that I am preparing for

the  future  cannot  even  be  touched  upon  in  letters?  I  have  concluded  an

alliance with Wagner. You cannot think how near we stand to each other now

and how closely related our schemes are. What I have had to hear about my

book is incredible, but that is the reason why I do not write anything about it.

What is your opinion on the subject? Everything I hear about it makes me

uncommonly serious, for it is out of voices such as these that I divine the

future of my schemes. This life is going to be very hard still.

  In Leipzig irritation seems to prevail again. Nobody there writes me a line

about it, not even Ritschl.

  My dear friend, some time or other we absolutely must live together; it is

a  sacred  necessity.  For  some  while  I  have  been  living  in  a  tremendous

current;  nearly  every  day  something  astounding  happens,  while  my

aspirations and intentions continue to rise. Let me tell you as a great secret,

and  begging  you  to  keep  it  to  yourself,  that  among  other  things  I  am

preparing a Promemoria about the University of Strasburg in the form of aninterpellation for the Reichstag, to be delivered to Bismarck. In it I wish to

show how shamefully a great opportunity was lost of making a truly German

Educational Institute for the regeneration of the German spirit and for the

total extermination of what has hitherto been called "culture." War to the

knife! or, rather, to the cannon!

  Your friend,

  THE MOUNTED ARTILLERYMAN WITH THE HEAVIEST GUNS.

  To Rohde - June, 1872

  Bale, June 18, 1872.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  As the result of stomach and intestinal trouble I have been in bed for a

few days and am still feeling rather seedy today. So do not expect anything

exceptionally rational if I now answer your letter after having all sorts of

conflicting thoughts and ideas about it. Ah, my dear friend, in such cases the

wisest course cannot be discovered by cunning; it is only afterward that one

realizes whether one has seized upon the right thing or not. For the case is

exceptional, and I do not know by what analogy to decide it. For my part I

lay  very  great  stress  upon  the  fact  that  the  philologists  will  receive  a

wholesome surprise when you suddenly stand up for me as a philologist.

What Wagner in his love for me has written I do not know. In view of the

coarse rudeness of our fellow philologist, it will in any case have a different

effect from what he expects. It is on occasions like these that the invisible

conspiracy against the spirit becomes visible. But what they will least expect,

the most terrible feature of it all, will be that a qualified philologist should

come to my support. The confidence that this could never happen explains

the  superlatively  impudent  tone  of  this  Berlin  youth.[47]  I  am  moreover

perfectly satisfied in my own mind that, to do him justice, he is only the echo

of the "superiors" who inspire him. As a wholesome warning and to avoid

having to deal with these disgusting Berlin Gesundbrunn people,[48] every

time we produce something new you would, according to Wagner's letter, do

something eminently salutary if you described to philologists what in all its

earnestness and rigour our position toward antiquity actually is, and above all

if you could lay stress upon the fact that it is not open to every potty little

philologist-whoever he may be-to have his say in these matters, much less,

therefore, to criticise them. Dear friend, I imagine your essay starting off with

general observations about our philological work; the more general and more

earnest these observations are, the easier will it be to address the whole toWagner. In your opening you might perhaps explain why you turn precisely

to Wagner and why you do not address yourself to some philological body,

for instance. You might point out that at present we entirely lack any supreme

forum for the most ideal results of our studies of antiquity. Then you might

make  some  mention  of  our  experiences  and  hopes  in  Bayreuth  and  thus

justify us in connecting our aspirations in regard to antiquity with this cry of

"Awake! for the day is at hand!"[49] And then you might proceed to deal

with my book, etc. Ah, my dear friend, it is ridiculous for me, in this seedy

mood, to go and write all this to you. But the principal thing seems to be that

we  should  not  forego  our  intention  of  addressing  Wagner,  because  it  is

precisely this direct relationship to Wagner that most terrifies the philologists

and compels them most forcibly to reflect. At the same time the slaughter of

Willamowitz  must  be  done  on  purely  philological  lines.  Perhaps  after  a

somewhat  lengthy  introduction  dealing  with  generalities  and  addressed  to

Wagner, you might draw a line, and then with some apologies turn to the

execution. In any case, toward the end of the essay your tone must once more

become so general and earnest that the reader will forget Willamowitz and

remember only that we are not to be trifled with-which will mean a good deal

where philologists are concerned. For up to the present day they have always

regarded me as a sort of philological joker, or, as I heard a little while ago, a

writer on music.

  As the essay will in any case be read by many who are not philologists,

remember, dear friend, not to be too "noble" in the matter of your quotations,

so that the non-philological friends of antiquity may find out where they have

something to learn. Unfortunately the tone of my own essay did not allow of

any instruction of this sort. If possible, try to wipe out the impression that it

deals with creatures in the moon and not with the Greeks. Will your pamphlet

cover as many as thirty or forty pages? And are you agreeable to its being

published by Fritzsch, or should Tr�bner have it? Ritschl would be sure to

manage that for me. (Ritschl is extraordinarily kind and well disposed to me.)

Forgive this foolish letter, dear friend, and do exactly as you feel inclined in

the matter. But rest assured that if you do it I shall thoroughly appreciate it. In

my present isolated position I may be ignored as a visionary or an ass. But if

we stand together, both united by our love for Wagner, we shall arouse a

frantic,  an  egregious  amount  of  attention  among  the  army  of  philological

duffers and rogues.

  Your affectionate and devoted friend,  F. N.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - October, 1872

  Spl�gen, Hotel Bodenhaus.

    Beginning of October, 1872.

  MY DARLING MOTHER:

  This time you are going to laugh, for this long letter is all about a journey

and lots of funny things. Half against my will I decided to go to Italy; though

it  lay  heavily  on  my  conscience  that  I  had  already  written  you  a  letter

accepting. But who can resist the capricious manner in which the weather has

suddenly become the reverse of what it was! Now it is beautifully and purely

autumnal, just the very weather for a walking tour. Or, to be nearer the truth,

I felt the most burning desire for once to be quite alone with my thoughts for

a little while. You can guess from the address of the hotel printed above that I

have been unexpectedly successful.

  . . . I had almost reached Zurich when I discovered that my companion in

the compartment was a man who was well known to me and had been even

better recommended the musician Goetz (a pupil of Billow's)-and he told me

how  much  his  musical  work  had  increased  in  Zurich  since  Kirclmer's

departure. But what seemed to agitate him most of all was the prospect of

seeing his opera accepted by the Hanover Theatre and produced for the first

time.  After  leaving  Zurich,  in  spite  of  the  nice  unobtrusive  company,  I

gradually grew so cold and ill that I had not the courage to go as far as Chur.

With  great  difficulty-that  is  to  say,  with  a  splitting  headache-I  reached

Weesen and the Lake of Wallenstatt in the dead of night. I found the Schwert

Hotel bus and got into it, and it set me down at a fine, comfortable, though

completely empty, hotel. On the following morning I rose with a headache.

My window looked on to the Lake of Wallenstatt, which you can imagine as

being like the Lake of Lucerne, but much simpler and not so sublime. Then I

went on to Chur, feeling unfortunately ever more and more ill at ease-so

much so that I went through Ragaz, etc., almost without feeling the slightest

interest. I was very glad to be able to leave the train at Chur, refused the post

official's offer to drive with him-which after all was the plan-and, putting up

at the Hotel Lukmanier, I went straight to bed. It was 10 a.m. I slept well

until 2 p.m., felt better and ate a little. A smart and well informed waiter

recommended me to walk as far as Pessug, a place that was imprinted on my

memory by a picture I had seen of it in an illustrated paper. Sabbath peace

and an afternoon mood prevailed in the town of Chur. I walked up the mainroad at a leisurely pace; as on the previous day, everything lay before me

transfigured by the glow of autumn. The scenery behind me was magnificent,

while the view constantly changed and widened. After about half an hour's

walk I came to a little side path which was beautifully shaded; until then the

road  had  been  rather  hot.  Then  I  reached  the  gorge  through  which  the

Rabiusa pours; its beauty defies description. I pressed on over bridges and

paths winding round the side of the rock for about half an hour, and at last

discovered Bad Passug indicated by a flag. At first it disappointed me, for I

had  expected  a  Pension  and  saw  only  a  second-rate  inn,  full  of  Sunday

excursionists from Chur-a crowd of comfortably feasting and coffee-sipping

families. The first thing I did was to drink three glassfuls of the saline-soda

spring; then the improved state of my head soon allowed me to add a bottle of

white Asti Spumante you remember it! together with the softest of goat's milk

cheese. A man with Chinese eyes, who sat at my table, also had some of the

Asti  to  drink;  he  thanked  me,  drank  and  was  much  gratified.  Then  the

proprietess  handed  me  a  number  of  analyses  of  the  water,  etc.  Finally,

Sprecher,  the  proprietor  of  the  watering  place,  an  excitable  sort  of  man,

showed me all over his property, the incredibly fantastic position of which I

was obliged to acknowledge. Again I drank copious draughts of water from

three  entirely  different  springs.  The  proprietor  promised  the  opening  of

important new springs, and noticing my interest in the matter offered to make

me  his  partner  in  the  founding  of  a  hotel,  etc.,  etc.-irony!  The  valley  is

extremely  fascinating  for  a  geologist  of  unfathomable  versatility-aye,  and

even whimsicality. There are seams of graphite and there is also quartz with

ochre. The proprietor even hinted at gold. You can see the most different

kinds of stone strata and varieties of stone, bending hither and thither and

cracked as in the Axenstein on the Lake of Lucerne, but here they are much

smaller and less rugged. Late in the evening, just as it was getting dusk, I

returned  delighted  with  my  afternoon,  although  my  mind  often  wandered

back to the reception I ought to have been enjoying at Naumburg.[50] A little

child with flaxen hair was looking about for nuts, and was very amusing. At

last an aged couple came towards me, father and daughter. They had a few

words to say, and listened in turn. He was a very old, hoary cabinet maker,

had  been  in  Naumburg  fifty-two  years  ago  while  on  his  wanderings,  and

remembered a very hot day there. His son has been a missionary in India

since 1858, and is expected to come to Chur next year in order to see his

father once more. The daughter said she had often been to Egypt, and spokeof B�le as an unpleasant, hot, and stuffy town. I accompanied the good old

hobbling couple a little further. Then I returned to dinner at my hotel, where I

found one or two companions ready for the Spl�gen tour on the morrow. On

Monday  I  rose  at  4  a.m.,  the  diligence  being  timed  to  leave  just  after  5.

Before  we  left  we  had  to  sit  in  an  evil-smelling  waiting  room,  among  a

number of peasants from Graubtinden and Tessin. But at this early hour man

is in any case a disagreeable creature. I was released by the departure of the

diligence, for I had arranged with the conductor to occupy his seat high up on

the top of the conveyance. There I was alone, and it was the finest diligence

drive I have ever had. I cannot write about the tremendous grandeur of the

Via mala; it made me feel as if I did not yet know Switzerland at all. This is

my Nature, and when we got near to Spl�gen I was overcome by the wish to

stay there. I found a good hotel and a little room that was quite touching in its

simplicity.  And  yet  it  has  a  balcony  from  which  one  can  enjoy  a  most

beautiful view. This high Alpine valley (about 5,000 feet) is exactly to my

taste-pure and bracing air, hills and rocks of every shape and size, and mighty

snow mountains all around. But what I like most of all are the magnificent

high roads along which I walk for hours at a time, sometimes in the direction

of  Bernaclino  and  sometimes  along  the  heights  of  the  Pass  of  Spl�gen,

without heeding the road in the least. But as often as I look about me I am

certain to see something gorgeous and unexpected. Tomorrow it is almost

sure to snow, and I am heartily looking forward to it. In the afternoon, if the

diligence arrives, I take my meal with the new arrivals. There is no need for

me to speak to anyone; no one knows me; I am absolutely alone and could

stay here for weeks, sitting and walking about. In my little room I work with

renewed vigour-that is to say, I make notes and collect ideas for the theme

that  is  chiefly  occupying  me  at  present:  "The  Future  of  Our  Educational

Institutions."

  You do not know how pleased I am with this place. Since I have come to

know it, Switzerland has acquired quite a new charm for me. Now I know of

a nook where I can gain strength, work with fresh energy, and live without

any company. In this place human beings seem to be like phantoms.

  Now I have described everything to you. The days that follow will all be

like  the  first.  Thank  God,  those  damnations  known  as  "change"  and

"distraction"  are  lacking  here.  Here  I  am  together  with  my  pen,  ink,  and

paper. All of us send our heartiest wishes.

  Your devoted son,    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Rohde - November, 1872

  Bale, November, 1872.

  MY VERY DEAR FRIEND:

  I think we shall be able to survive it. But something has happened here

that  somewhat  depresses  me.  In  our  University  the  philologists  hare  kept

away this winter term. A perfectly unique occurrence which you will interpret

in the same way as I do. In one particular case I know for a fact that a certain

student who wished to study philology here was prevented from doing so in

Bonn, and that he joyfully wrote to his relations saying he thanked God he

was not going to a University where I was a teacher. In short, the Vehmic

Court[51] has done its duty, but we must not take any notice of it. It is jolly

hard though for me to know that the little University should have suffered on

my account. We are twenty men short of what we were last term. With the

utmost pains I was only able to muster two students to attend a lecture on the

rhetoric of the Greeks and Romans-that is to say, one Germanic and one Law

student.

  Jacob Burckhardt and Ratsherr Vischer enjoyed your essay immensely. I

informed  each  of  them  of  the  fine  copies  you  sent  me,  and  I  also  told

Overbeck, Ritschl and the Florentine ladies, Olga Herzen and Fr�ulein von

Meysenbug,  of  them.  I  even  have  two  of  them  in  an  Edition  de  Luxe.  I

wonder whether these copies are as you pictured them in your dream. They

bear the title E. Rohde on The Birth of Tragedy and include your two essays.

To me these essays constitute a veritable treasure which every author of the

past and future will have to envy me. My friend Immerman, here, always

says that your stuff is at least as good as mine. In short, they have noticed our

Orestes  and  Pylades  relationship  ?a?ep??s??  ???  ?e????s?[52]  and  they

rejoice over it. What I only mention, because neither of us doubts it, is that

many more are angry about it. . . .

  . . . Have you heard of the Zollner scandal in Leipzig? Just have a look at

his book on the nature of comets. There is a tremendous deal on our side in it.

Since this production the honest man has been as good as excommunicated in

the most shabby manner from the whole of the republic of letters. His nearest

friends are renouncing him and he is proclaimed "mad" to all the world! He is

seriously declared "deranged," simply because he refuses to blow into the

Tantara  trumpet  of  the  clique.  Such  is  the  spirit  of  Leipzig's  scholastic

ochlocracy!  Are  you  aware,  too,  that  a  certain  alienist  has  proved  in  the  most

"dignified language" that Wagner is demented? And you are probably aware

of the fact that the same thing has been done for Schopenhauer by another

alienist.

  You see to what measures these ";healthy people" resort. True, they do

not decree the scaffold for the discomfiting ingenia, but this sort of sneaking

and malevolent creation of suspicion answers their purpose much better than

the sudden removal of their enemies; they undermine the confidence of the

rising generation. Schopenhauer forgot this dodge! It is singularly worthy of

the vulgarity of the vulgarest age. . . .

  Yours affectionately,

  F.

  Nietzsche To Malvida Von Meysenbug - April, 1873

  Bale, April 6, 1873.

    DEAREST FRAULEIN:

  . . . At Bayreuth I hope to find courage and good cheer once more and to

fortify myself in all that is right. I dreamt last night that I had my Gradus ad

Parnassum  rarely  and  beautifully  bound;  the  symbolism  attached  to  the

binding of a book is comprehensible enough, even if deficient in taste. This is

a truth! From time to time one ought to have oneself newly bound, so to

speak, by intercourse with good and robust men; otherwise one loses isolated

leaves and falls ever more and more to pieces. And that our life ought to be a

Gradus  ad  Parnassum  is  also  a  truth  which  one  ought  often  to  repeat  to

oneself. My Parnassus of the future is-provided I take great pains and have

decent luck as well as plenty of time-to become perhaps a tolerable writer,

but above all to become ever more moderate in the production of literature.

From time to time I feel a childish repulsion toward printed paper, which at

such times seems to me simply soiled paper. And I can picture a time when

men will prefer reading little and writing less, while thinking much and doing

even more. For the whole world is now waiting for the man of deeds, who

strips the habits of centuries from himself and others, and who sets a better

example for posterity to follow. Under my own roof something very fine is in

process of completion, a description of our present day theology, bearing

particularly upon the spirit of Christianity. My friend and brother in thought,

Professor Overbeck, to my own knowledge the freest theologist now living,

and in any case one of the greatest authorities on Church history, is now at

work on this description, and will, if I am not mistaken-and we are quiteagreed on this point-make known a few terrible truths to the world. Bale

looks well on the road to becoming the most suspected of places! . . .

  Your devoted friend,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - September, 1873

  Bale, September 21, 1873.

  MY DARLING MOTHER:

  And so our dear aunt has passed away and we are becoming more and

more lonely. To grow old and to grow solitary seem to be synonymous, and

at last a man is all alone and makes others feel lonely by his death.

  It was precisely because I knew so little of my father, and had to form a

picture of him from the materials supplied by chance conversations, that his

nearest relatives were more to me than aunts usually are. When I think of

Aunt Rickchen and the Plauen relatives, etc., I rejoice over the fact that they

all remained true to their exceptional nature until they attained to a great age,

and  were  sufficiently  self  reliant  to  be  less  than  usually  dependent  upon

external influences and upon the doubtful good will of their fellow creatures.

I rejoice over this fact because in it I find the racial peculiarity of those who

call themselves Nietzsche, and I possess it myself.

  And that is why our good aunt was always so kindly disposed towards

me,  because  she  realized  how  akin  we  were  in  one  important  particular,

namely, in this important Nietzschean trait. For this reason I honour their

memory by wishing with all my might that when I grow old I may not desert

myself-that is to say, the spirit of my forebears.

  Do not expect any more from me for the moment, dear mother you who

are so very much worried because you always will be so helpful and think

kindly of your son,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - October, 1873

  Bale, October 27, 1873.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  . . . The green numbers of the Grenzboten have just published a Non plus

ultra under the title of "Herr Friedrich Nietzsche and German Culture." All

the  powers  are  mobilized  against  me-the  police,  the  authorities,  and  the

colleagues. It is emphatically declared that I shall be ostracized from every

German university, and that Bale will probably do likewise. It proceeds to

inform the reader that owing to a trick of Ritschls and the stupidity of thepeople  of  Bale  I  was  transformed  from  a  mere  student  into  a  University

professor. Bale then came in for some abuse as an obscure little University. I

am  denounced  as  an  enemy  of  the  German  Empire  and  the  ally  of  the

Internationalists, etc. in short, a commendable and cheerful Documentum.

What a pity I cannot send it to you! Even Fritszch gets a kick or two; they

think it scandalous that a German publisher should ever have accepted my

work. So you see, dearest friend, our No. 1 has-as Fritzsch would say-"found

favour with the public."

  Nine Bale newspapers have now referred to me in all manner of ways, but

on the whole much more seriously than that truculent Grenzboten reviewer

and humbug. Your ever devoted and affectionate friend,

  F. N.

  To Rohde - December, 1873

  Naumburg, December 31, 1873.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  What a lot of good you have done me with your letter, particularly as I

was lying in bed feeling ill after the journey and full of resentment towards

life. Really, if I had not my friends, I wonder whether I should not myself

begin to believe that I am demented. As it is, however, by my adherence to

you I adhere to myself, and if we stand security for each other, some thing

must ultimately result from our way of thinking-a possibility which until now

the whole world has doubted.

  And to this whole world belong even the Ritschls, to whom I paid a short

visit and who in half an hour fired a rapid volley of words at me and against

me, under which I remained unscathed and, moreover, felt it. Finally they

came to the conclusion that I was arrogant and despised them. The general

impression  was  hopeless.  At  one  moment  old  Ritschl  simply  raved  with

indignation about Wagner as a poet, and then again about the French (by-the-

bye, I am understood to be an admirer of the French); finally he argued from

hearsay, but in the most atrocious manner, about Overbeck's book. I learnt

that Germany was still in its 'teens, and therefore I too claimed the right of

being something of a boy in his teens (for they also censured my lack of

moderation and my brutality towards Strauss). On the other hand, Strauss as a

classical writer of prose is completely annihilated, for old Ritschl and his

wife say so, and have long since come to the conclusion that even "Voltaire"

[53] was written in abominably bad style.

  I lived at Fritzsch's and was really delighted with that good man. Thingsare going well with him, his health included. My second "Thoughts Out of

Season" (or over-seasoned thoughts) is now in the press. You will receive the

first proofs in a few days, for, my dear friend, I am going to avail myself of

your willing kindness and beg you to help me with your advice here and

there, and moral and intellectual correction. After all, we must not lose much

time, for it will be printed quickly and must be quite ready at the end of

January.

    Therefore, my dear good friend, send your corrected proofs every time as

soon as possible to me here in Bale, for the long distances make things a little

complicated and we must try to avoid any hitch in the printing. . . .

  Karl  Hillebrand's  anonymous  book,  "Twelve  Letters  By  An  Aesthetic

Heretic" (Berlin, Oppenheiin, 1874), has given me the most unbounded joy.

How refreshing it is! Read and wonder; he is one of us, one of the "Company

of the Hopeful."

  May this company flourish in the new year and may we remain good

comrades! Ah, my dear fellow, we have no choice; we must either be hopeful

or desperate. Once and for all, I have resolved to hope. I was very vexed at

the  horribly  cautious  academic  Confratres  in  Kiel.  Fancy  such  fear  of

"Youth"! . . .

  So may we remain faithful friends in 1874 and continue so until the last

day.

  Yours,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Rohde - February, 1874

  Bale, February 15, 1874.

    DEAREST FRIEND:

  First of all, my best Sunday greeting to you. Are you living in the gray

north? We are having such fine warm days with plenty of sunshine and even

deep coloured sunsets already. We have only had one day's snow the whole

winter.  Since  the  new  year,  too,  I  have  been  living  more  carefully  and

rationally, and am feeling fit in consequence. My eyes are the only trouble. I

sorely need an amanuensis. I must tell you though that for the last six months

a most sympathetic and talented pupil has come under my notice, one who

already belongs to our party heart and soul. His name is Baumgartner, an

Alsatian, and the son of a manufacturer of M�lhausen. He comes to me

every Wednesday afternoon and stops the evening, and then I dictate to him

or he reads aloud to me, or letters are written. In short, he is a godsend to me,and, I assure you, will be for all of us one day. At Easter I shall go back to

Naumburg again in order to try a systematic course of rest and wholesome

living, and then I shall ultimately be able to bear things a little better. I have

thought out a good deal since Christmas, and have had to roam so far afield

that often when my proofs arrive I wonder when I could have written the

stuff, and whether it can all be my work. I am feeling very hostile just now

towards all political and smug bourgeois virtues and duties, and occasionally

I even soar far above "national" feeling. May God mend this and me!

  In addition to all your trouble, dear faithful friend, you have also had that

of proof-reading. The smallest hint is gratefully turned to account, and many

a blemish has been removed by your hand. By-the-bye, a whole number of

strange errors had nothing to do with me, but arose out of the copying of my

illegible MS. Unfortunately I was unable to avail myself of your help for the

last sheet. For many reasons I thought they had forgotten to send it to you and

time was pressing. Luckily I was able to remove the worst stumbling block

myself, and have made the text of the conclusion a little lighter by cutting out

about a page. A certain generality of treatment was, however, necessary, as I

had to take into account the elaboration of some of the special arguments in

subsequent  "Thoughts  Out  of  Season."  So  let  the  monster  go  its  way.  I

wonder who will find any pleasure in it! Who will even read it? I believe

people will think it a piece of great foolishness on my part-and they will be

right! But I am really heartily tired of all this cleverness and must become

absorbed in myself. On my honour, I cannot help it. But promise me you will

not immediately despise me on that account. For I really believe that you

understand me in these things and have a right to it, dear friend. When I think

of my fellow philologists I sometimes feel something like shame. Still, I do

not believe I can be so easily driven off my appointed path-and before that I

mean  to  say  for  once  all  I  have  to  say;  one  cannot  do  oneself  a  greater

kindness than that. When you get your copy (which I hope will be within a

fortnight), I beg you to do me just this one favour: tell me as severely and

briefly as you like all about my faults, my mannerisms, and the dangers of

my  method  of  exposition,  for  I  am  not  satisfied  with  it  and  aspire  to

something quite different. Help me, therefore, with a few little hints, I shall

be most grateful. . . .

    Good-bye, dear friend.

  Yours, FRIEDRICH N.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - April, 1874  Bale, April 1, 1874.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  If only you had not such an exaggeratedly high opinion of me! I am afraid

that one day you will be somewhat disappointed in me, and I will inaugurate

this change in you at once by declaring from the bottom of my heart that I

deserve not one word of the praise you have lavished upon me. If only you

knew  how  disheartened  and  melancholy  I  really  feel  about  myself  as  a

productive being! All I long for is a little freedom, a taste of the real breath of

life; and I kick, I revolt against the many, the unutterably many constraints to

which my mind is still subject. And of real productive work there can be no

thought so long as one is not freed, however slightly, from one's trammels

and the pain or oppression arising from one's limited outlook. Shall I ever

attain to inner freedom? It is very doubtful. The goal is too remote, and even

if one gets within measurable distance of it, one has by that time consumed

all  one's  strength  in  a  long  search  and  struggle.  When  freedom  is  at  last

attained, one is as lifeless and feeble as a day-fly by night. That is what I

dread so much. It is a misfortune to be so conscious of one's struggle and so

early in life! And unlike the artist or the ascetic, I cannot balance my doubts

by means of great deeds. How wretched and loathsome it is to me to be

continually wailing like a mire-drum. For the moment I am really very, very

tired of everything-more than tired.

  My health, by-the-bye, is excellent; you need have no fears about that.

But I am not quite satisfied with Nature, who ought to have given me a little

more intellect as well as a warmer heart. I always fall short of the best. To

know this, is the greatest torture a man can have. Regular work in an official

post is so good because it leads to a certain obtuseness and then one suffers

less.

  . . . Accept my best wishes for yourself and your dear parents. Think what

life would be like without a friend! Could one bear it? Would one have borne

it? Dubito.

    FRIDERICUS.

  To Rohde - October, 1874

  Bale, October 7, 1874.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  Last night I returned from the mountains, and this morning I mean to set

to and consecrate the work of the winter term by means of a birthday letter to

you. I do not lack either courage or confidence; I have brought back both ofthese with me from the mountains and the lakes, where I discovered what it

was that one lacked most, or rather what it was that one has too much of.

That is to say, egoism; and this is the result of one's eternal lonely brooding

and lonely suffering. In the end, one begins to feel constantly as if one were

covered with a hundred scars and every movement were painful. But, joking

apart, I shall very soon be thirty and things must change somewhat; they must

become more virile, more even in tenour, and no longer so damned unstable.

To continue one's work and to think of oneself as little as possible-that must

be the first necessity. After some reflection it has struck me that I am very

ungrateful and childish with my irritating despair, for I have been thinking

how incomparably lucky I have been during the last seven years and how

little I can gauge how rich I am in my friends. Truth to tell, I live through

you;  I  advance  by  leaning  upon  your  shoulders,  for  my  self-esteem  is

wretchedly weak and you have to assure me of my own value again and

again.  In  addition  to  that,  you  are  my  best  examples,  for  both  you  and

Overbeck bear life's lot with more dignity and less wailing, although in many

respects things are more and more difficult for you than for me. But what I

feel most is the way you outstrip me in loving solicitude and unselfishness. I

have thought much about these facts of late, and I may surely be allowed to

mention them to you in a birthday letter.

    Farewell, my dear friend, and remain as affectionate to me as you have

been hitherto-then we shall easily be able to endure life yet a while longer.

  Your devoted friend,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To Malvida Von Meysenbug - October, 1874

  Bale, October 25, 1874.

    DEAREST FRAULEIN:

  At last I am able once again to let you have some news of me by sending

you another work of mine.[54]From the contents of this last essay you will be

able to form some idea of all that I have experienced in the interval. Also,

that with the lapse of years I am, among other things, in a much more serious

and precarious position than you might gather from the mere reading of the

book itself. In summa, however, you will surmise that things are going well

with me, and going onwards, too, and that all I lack, alas! is just a little of the

sunshine of life. Otherwise I should be compelled to acknowledge that things

could not be going better with me than they are. For it is indeed a piece of

great  good  fortune  for  me  to  progress  step  by  step  towards  theaccomplishment of my mission. And now I have written three of the thirteen

"Thoughts Out of Season," and the fourth is already taking shape in my mind.

How happy I shall feel when I have at last unburdened my heart of all its

negative hates and all its indignation, and yet I dare hope that in five years I

shall be within sight of this glorious goal! Already at the present moment I

am thankful to feel how very much more clearly and sharply I am learning to

see things-spiritually (not bodily, alas!) and how very much more definitely

and  intelligibly  I  can  express  myself.  Provided  that  I  am  not  led  entirely

astray in my course, or that my health does not break down, something must

certainly come of all this. Just imagine a series of fifty such essays as the four

I have already written-all the product of a soul's experience forced into the

light of day! With such matter one could not help but produce some effect;

for the tongues of many would have been unloosed and enough would have

been put into words that could not be so quickly forgotten, much that today is

almost as good as forgotten yea, that is scarcely to hand. And what should

divert me in my course? Even hostile attacks I can now turn to account and to

pleasure, for they often enlighten me more quickly than friendly sympathy,

and I desire nothing more than to be enlightened about the highly complex

system  of  conflicting  elements  that  constitutes  the  "modern  world."

Fortunately, I am quite devoid of all political and social ambition, so that I

need fear no dangers in that direction-no loadstones to draw me aside, no

compulsion to compromise or to consider consequences; in short, I can say

all I think, and what I want to do is to test once and for all to what extent

modern mankind-so proud of its freedom of thought-can endure free thought.

I do not ask anything either excessive or fantastic from life; besides, in the

course of the next few years we shall experience something for which all the

world of the past and the future may envy us. Moreover, I am blessed beyond

all  deserts  with  the  most  excellent  of  friends;  and  now,  quite  between

ourselves, the only thing I want, and that quite soon, is a good wife, and then

I shall regard all my worldly wishes as fulfilled. All the rest depends upon

myself. . . .

  Meanwhile, my heartiest wishes for your health, and may you continue to

think kindly of

  Your most devoted servant,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To His Sister - January, 1875

  Bale, January 22, 1875.  MY DEAR SISTER:

  It was a good thing that you wrote me a letter close on the heels of the

one mother wrote, for I was beside myself and had already written down

some bitter words. I now see that I misunderstood her.

  But how is it that she was able to misunderstand me so, and all this time

to conceal from me this incomprehensible hostility to the two Wagners? Am I

so difficult to understand and so easy to misunderstand in all my intentions,

plans, and friendships? Ah, we lonely ones and free spirits-it is borne home to

us that in some way or other we constantly appear different from what we

think. Whereas we wish for nothing more than truth and straightforwardness,

we are surrounded by a net of misunderstanding, and despite our most ardent

wishes  we  cannot  help  our  actions  being  smothered  in  a  cloud  of  false

opinion, attempted compromises, semi-concessions, charitable silence, and

erroneous interpretations. Such things gather a weight of melancholy on our

brow;  for  we  hate  more  than  death  the  thought  that  pretence  should  be

necessary, and such incessant chafing against these things makes us volcanic

and menacing. From time to time we avenge ourselves for all our enforced

concealment and compulsory self-restraint. We emerge from our cells with

terrible faces, our words and deeds are then explosions, and it is not beyond

the verge of possibility that we perish through ourselves. Thus dangerously

do I live! It is precisely we solitary ones that require love and companions in

whose  presence  we  may  be  open  and  simple,  and  the  eternal  struggle  of

silence and dissimulation can cease.

  Yes, I am glad that I can be myself, openly and honestly with you, for

you are such a good friend and companion, and the older you grow and the

more you free yourself from the Naumburg atmosphere, the more will you

certainly adapt yourself to all my views and aspirations.

  With love and devotion,

  YOUR BROTHER.

  (Marginal note by Nietzsche in the foregoing letter): You can read all this

in  print  in  my  Schopenhauer;  but  they  are  at  the  same  time  my  own

experiences and feelings that always visit me-as at the present moment, for

instance.

  To Rohde - February, 1875

  Bale, February 28, 1875.

    DEAREST FRIEND:

  . . . . Now, let me tell you something you do not yet know-somethingwhich you, as my most intimate and most sympathetic friend, have a right to

know. We two, Overbeck and I, have a domestic trouble, a domestic ghost.

Please don't have a fit when you hear that X- is contemplating going over to

the Holy Catholic Church and wants to become a Catholic priest in Germany.

This has only just come to light, but as we afterwards heard, to our dismay,

he has been thinking over it for years, though his resolution has never been so

mature as it is now. I cannot help feeling hurt over it, and at times it seems to

me the worst possible slight that could be given me. Of course, he does not

mean it in that way, for up to the present he has not for one moment thought

of anyone but himself, and the confounded stress our religion lays on the

"salvation of one's own soul" leaves him utterly indifferent to anything else,

friend ship included. . . . At last, he confessed what his attitude was, and now

every  three  days,  almost,  there  is  an  explosion.  The  poor  man  is  in  a

desperate condition and no longer accessible to words of counsel; that is to

say, he is so entirely led by vague aspirations that he seems to us like a

wandering valleity. Oh, our excellent, pure Protestant air! I have never in my

life before felt my dependence upon the spirit of Luther so strongly as I do

now, and this wretched man wants to turn his back on all these liberating

geniuses! It is so very hard for me to understand how, after eight years of

intimate association with me, this spectre should arise at my elbow, that I

often wonder whether he can be in his right senses, and whether he ought not

to undergo a cold-water cure. And, after all, I am the man on whom the

blame of this conversion will rest. God knows I do not say that out of egoistic

solicitude. But I, too, believe that I stand for something holy, and I should

blush  for  shame  if  I  were  suspected  of  having  had  anything  to  do  with

Catholicism, for there is nothing I hate with a more deadly hatred.

  Interpret this ghastly story in as friendly a manner as possible and send

me a few words of comfort. I have been wounded precisely in my friendship,

and hate the dishonest, sneaking nature of many friendships more than ever,

and shall have to be more cautious in future. X- himself will doubtless be

quite at home in some sort of conventicle, but in our company he seems to

me now to be suffering incessantly.

  Your disconsolate friend,

    FRIEDRICH N.

  For Overbeck also.

  Please burn this letter if you think fit.

  To Rohde - December, 1875  Bale, December 8, 1875.

  Ah, dear friend, I did not know what to say to you, so I held my peace

and was full of fear and anxiety on your account. I did not even like to ask

how things were going, but how often, how very often my heartfelt sympathy

sped your way! Everything has turned out as badly as possible, and I can

think of only one way in which it could have been worse-to wit, if the matter

were less appallingly plain than it actually is. The most intolerable thing of all

is surely doubt, ghostlike semi-certainty-and you have at least been relieved

of this, which was such a torment to you here. I am now racking my brain in

trying to discover how you can possibly be helped. For a long while I thought

that  they  were  going  to  transfer  you  and  that  they  would  give  you  an

appointment at Freiburg in Breisgau. But afterwards it struck me that such an

idea had never even entered their minds. Certainly the publication of your

work will prove the best remedy in your case. One cannot help deriving some

pleasure from that, and at all events it will force you to think of other matters.

This promises to be a steady pursuit and will perhaps help you over this

terrible winter.

  Let me tell you how I am faring. As far as my health is concerned, things

are  not  so  good  as  I  really  supposed  they  would  be  when  I  effected  the

complete change in my mode of life here. Every two or three weeks I have to

lie in bed for about thirty-six hours in great pain with the usual trouble you

know so well. Perhaps it will gradually get better, but I feel as if I had never

had such a hard winter. What with new lectures, etc., the day drags so wearily

that in the evening I am always more and more glad to have finished, and

actually marvel at the hardness of existence. The whole exasperating business

does not seem worth while; the pain you inflict on yourself and others is out

of all proportion to the benefit either they or you yourself derive from your

efforts. This is the opinion of a man who does not happen to be troubled by

his passions, though he is certainly not made happy by them either. During

the hours that I rest my eyes, my sister reads aloud to me, almost always

Walter  Scott,  whom  I  would  readily  agree  with  Schopenhauer  in  calling

"immortal."  What  pleases  me  so  much  in  him  is  his  artistic  calm,  his

Andante. I should like to recommend him to you, but there are some things

which, though they benefit me, can get no hold of your spirit, because you

think more quickly and more sharply than I do. As to the use of novels for the

treatment  of  one's  soul,  I  will  say  nothing  more  particularly  as  you  are

already forced to help yourself with your own "novel." Nay, I advise you toread "Don Quixote" again-not because it is the most cheerful but because it is

the most austere reading I know. I took it up during the summer holidays, and

all  personal  troubles  seemed  to  shrink  to  nothing  and  appear  simply

laughable, not even worthy of a wry face. All earnestness, all passion, and

everything men take to heart is Quixotism-for some things it is good to know

this; otherwise it is better not to know it. . . .

  Your friend,

  F. N.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - December, 1875

  Bale, December 13, 1875.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  I received your letter yesterday, and this morning, just at the beginning of

a  week  of  hard  work,  your  books  arrived.  A  man  certainly  ought  to  feel

cheerful when he has such sympathetic and affectionate friends! Believe me,

I admire the fine instinct of your friendship-I trust the expression does not

sound too biological-which made you light upon these Indian maxims, just as

I, with a sort of waxing thirst, have been turning longing eyes to India for the

last two months. From Schmeitzner's friend, Herr Widemann, I borrowed the

English translation of the Sutra Nipata, a portion of the sacred books of the

Buddhists, and I have already made a household word of a strong closing

sentence from one of the Sutras-"and thus I wander alone like a rhinoceros."

My conviction about the worthlessness of life and the delusiveness of all

aims frequently oppresses me so keenly, particularly when I lie in bed feeling

ill,  that  I  long  to  hear  more  of  this  Indian  wisdom,  provided  it  is  not

permeated  with  Judaeo-Christian  phraseology.  For,  some  time  or  other,  I

learnt to feel such a loathing for this phraseology that I literally have to be on

my guard against dealing unjustly with it.

  As to how the world wags-this you can tell from the enclosed letter from

that terrible sufferer Z-. Of course one ought not to cling to it, and yet what

can help one to endure life, when one no longer really wills anything! I am of

opinion that the will to knowledge is the last remaining vestige of the will to

life; it is an intermediary region between willing and no longer willing, a

piece of purgatory, in so far as we look discontentedly and contemptuously

on life, and a piece of Nirvana, in so far as, through it, the soul approaches

the state of pure disinterested contemplation. I am training myself to unlearn

the eager hurry of the will to knowledge. This is what all scholars suffer

from,  and  that  is  why  they  all  lack  the  glorious  serenity  derived  fromacquired enlightenment, insight. For the present I am too heavily burdened by

the various claims of my official post to help falling all too frequently though

reluctantly into that eager hurry, but by degrees I shall put all this right. And

then my health will be more settled-a condition I shall not attain before I

thoroughly deserve it, before, that is to say, I have discovered that state of my

soul  which  is,  as  it  were,  my  destiny,  that  healthy  state  in  which  it  has

retained  but  one  of  all  its  instincts-the  will  to  know.  A  simple  home,  a

perfectly  regular  daily  routine,  no  enervating  hankering  after  honours  or

society, my sister's company (which makes everything about me Nietzschean

and strangeful restful), the consciousness of having 40 excellent books of all

times and climes (and many more which are not altogether bad), the constant

joy of having found educators in Schopenhauer and Wagner, and the Greeks

as the object of my daily work, the belief that henceforward I shall no longer

lack  pupils[55]-all  these  things  now  for  the  time  being  make  up  my  life.

Unfortunately my chronic physical troubles, which at fortnightly intervals

seize me for about two days at a time and sometimes longer, must be added

to the reckoning. But they must end some day.

  Later on, when you are securely settled down in your own home, you will

be able to reckon upon me as a holiday guest who will be likely to spend

some considerable time with you. It is often a solace to me to exercise my

imagination anticipating these later years of your life, and I often think I may

one day be of service to you in your sons. Yes, dear old devoted Gersdorff,

we  have  now  shared  a  goodly  portion  of  youth,  experience,  education,

inclination,  hatred,  striving,  and  hope  in  common;  we  know  that  we  can

thoroughly enjoy even sitting beside each other in silence. I don't think we

need  to  give  each  other  any  pledges  or  promises,  because  we  thoroughly

believe in each other. I know from experience that you help me where you

can, and whenever I have reason to rejoice I always think, "How pleased

Gersdorff will be!" For, I must tell you, you have the magnificent gift of

sympathizing with another's joy and this is a rarer and nobler capacity than

pity.

  And now farewell, and may you cross the threshold of your new year of

life the same man as you have always been. I cannot wish you more. It was as

this  man  that  you  won  your  friends,  and  if  there  are  still  a  few  sensible

women knocking around you will not have much longer

  "To wander alone like a rhinoceros."

  Your devoted friend,    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr R. v. Seydlitz - September, 1876

  Bale, September 24, 1876.

  DEAR SIR:

  After a letter such as yours, containing so stirring a testimony of the depth

of your soul and intellect, I can say nothing but this: let us keep in close touch

with each other, let us see to it that we do not lose each other again now we

have  found  each  other!  I  rejoice  in  the  certainty  of  having  won  another

genuine friend. And if you only knew what this means to me! For am I not as

constantly engaged in the kidnapping of men as any pirate not, however, with

the object of selling them into bondage, but rather in order to sell them, with

myself, into freedom.

  Your sincere and devoted friend,

  FRIEDR. NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - May, 1876

  Bale, May 26, 1876.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  .  .  .  I  must  tell  you  something,  which,  so  far  as  other  people  are

concerned, is still a secret, and must remain so for the present: following

upon an invitation of the best friend in the world, Fr�ulein von Meysenbug,

I intend in October to spend a whole year in Italy. I have not yet been granted

leave by the authorities, but I think it will come, more particularly as, with

the view of sparing so small a corporation the burden of my pay, I have

volunteered to forfeit my salary for the whole period. Freedom! You cannot

imagine how deeply I breathe when I think of it! We shall live in the simplest

manner possible at Fano (on the Adriatic). This is my news. All my hopes

and  plans  regarding  my  ultimate  spiritual  emancipation  and  untiring

advancement are once more in full bloom. My confidence in myself, I mean

in my better self, fills me with courage. Even the state of my eyes does not

affect this. (Schiess thinks they are worse than they were some time ago. The

long and short of it is I want a secretary). My lectures are very well attended.

In one of them I have about 20 scholars, in the other about 10, and the same

numbers at the school. I shall certainly not marry; on the whole, I hate the

limitations  and  obligations  of  the  whole  civilized  order  of  things  so  very

much that it would be difficult to find a woman free-spirited enough to follow

my  lead.  The  Greek  philosophers  seem  to  me  ever  more  and  more  to

represent the paragon of what one should aim at in our mode of life. I readXenophon  s  Memorabilia  with  the  deepest  personal  in  terest.  Philologists

regard them as hopelessly tedious. You see how little of a philologist I am.

  F. N.

  To Madame Louise O. - September, 1876

  Bale, September, 1876.

  DEAR, KIND FRIEND:

  In the first place I was unable to write, for I underwent an eye-cure, and

now I ought not to write for a long long time to come! Nevertheless I read

your two letters again and again; I almost believe I read them too often. But

this new friendship is like new wine-very agreeable though perhaps a trifle

dangerous.

  At least for me.

  But for you also, especially when I think of the sort of free spirit you have

lighted upon!-a man who longs for nothing more than daily to be rid of some

comforting  belief,  and  who  seeks  and  finds  his  happiness  in  this  daily

increase in the emancipation of his spirit. It is possible I wish to become more

of a free spirit than I am capable of becoming.

  So what is to be done? An "Abduction from the Harem"[56] of Faith,

without Mozart's music?

  Do you know Fraulein von Meysenbug's autobiography published under

the title of "Memoirs of an Idealist?

  What is poor little Marcel doing with his little teeth? We all have to suffer

before  we  really  learn  to  bite,  physically  and  morally-biting  in  order  to

nourish ourselves, of course, not simply for the sake of biting!

  Is there no good portrait in existence of a certain blond and beautiful

woman?

  Sunday week I shall go to Italy for a long stay. You will hear from me

when  I  get  there.  In  any  case  a  letter  sent  to  my  address  in  Bale  (45

Sch�tzengraben) will reach me.

  In brotherly affection,

  Yours

  DR. FRIEDR. NIETZSCHE.

  To Rohde - August, 1877

    Rosenlauibad, August 28, 1877.

  DEAR OLD FRIEND:

  How can I express it? But every time I think of you I am overcome by a

sort of deep emotion; and when, a day or two ago, someone wrote to me"Rohde's young wife is an exceedingly sweet woman whose every feature is

illumined by her noble soul," I actually wept. And I can give you absolutely

no plausible reason for having done so. We might ask the psychologists for

an explanation. Ultimately they would declare it was envy and that I grudged

you your happiness, or that it was my vexation at someone having run away

with my friend and having concealed him Heaven alone knows where, on the

Rhine or in Paris, and refused to give him up again. When I was humming

my "Hymn to Solitude" to myself a few days ago, I suddenly had the feeling

that you could not abide my music at all and that you would much have

preferred a song on Dual Bliss. The same evening I played a song of this sort,

as well as I was able, and it was so successful that all the angels might have

listened to it with joy, particularly the human ones. But it was in a dark room

and no one heard it. Thus I am forced to consume my own happiness, tears,

and everything in private.

  Shall I tell you all about myself-how every day I set out two hours before

the  sun  rises  on  the  hills  and  after  that  take  my  walks  only  among  the

lengthening shadows of the afternoon and evening? How many things I have

thought out, and how rich I feel now that this year I have at last been allowed

to strip off the old moss growth of the daily routine of teaching and thinking!

As to my life here, I can only say that it is tolerable, in spite of all my

ailments which have certainly followed me even up to the heights-but I have

so many intervals of happy exultation both of thought and feeling.

  A little while ago I had a genuinely sacred day, thanks to "Prometheus

Unbound." If the poet[57] be not a true genius then I do not know what

genius means. The whole thing is wonderful, and I felt as if I had met my

own transfigured and exalted self in the work. I bow low before a man who is

capable of having and expressing such thoughts.

  In three days I shall return to Bale. My sister is already there and busy

preparing the place for my arrival.

  The faithful musician P. Gast is going to join our household, and is going

to undertake the duties of a friendly amanuensis.

  I am rather dreading the coming winter. Things must change. The man

who only has a few moments a day for what he regards as most important,

and who has to spend the rest of his time and energy performing duties which

others could carry out equally well-such a man is not a harmonious whole; he

must be in conflict with himself and must ultimately fall ill. If I exercise any

influence over youth at all, I owe it to my writings, and for these I have tothank my leisure moments-yes, the intervals I have won for myself, in the

midst of professional duties by means of illness. Well, things must change: si

male nunc non olim sic erit.[58] Meanwhile may the happiness of my friends

increase and flourish. It is always a great solace to me to think of you, my

dear friend (just now I have a vision of you on the bank of a lake surrounded

by roses and with a beautiful white swan swimming towards you).

  With brotherly affection,

  Yours

  F.

  To Madame Louise O. - August, 1877

    Rosenlauibad, August 29, 1877.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  I shall not forsake my mountain loneliness without once more writing to

tell you how fond I am of you. How superfluous it is to say this, or to write it,

isn't it? But my affection for anyone sticks to them like a thorn, and at times

is as troublesome as a thorn; it is not so easy to get rid of it. So be good

enough to receive this small, superfluous, and troublesome letter.

  I  have  been  told  that-well,  that  you  are  expecting,  hoping,  wishing.  I

deeply sympathized with you when I heard the news, and, believe me, your

wishes are mine. A fresh, good, and beautiful human being on earth!-that is

something, it is a great deal! As you absolutely refuse to immortalize yourself

in novels, you do so in this way. And we must all feel most grateful to you

(more particularly as I hear it is a much more trying affair even than the

writing of novels).

  A day or two ago, quite suddenly, I saw your eyes in the dark. Why does

no  one  ever  look  at  me  with  such  eyes?  I  exclaimed  irritably.  Oh,  it  is

ghastly!

  Do you know that no woman's voice has ever made a deep impression on

me, although I have met all kinds of famous women? But I firmly believe

there is a voice for me somewhere on earth, and I am seeking it. Where on

earth is it?

  Fare you well. May all the good fairies be constantly about you.

  Your devoted friend,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Seydlitz - January, 1878

  Bale, January 4, 1878.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:  . . . Yesterday Wagner sent me his Parsifal. My impression after the first

perusal  was  that  it  is  more  Liszt  than  Wagner;  it  is  in  the  spirit  of  the

Counter-Reformation. To me, accustomed as I am to the Greek and generally

human concept of things, it is all too Christian, too limited in its duration. It

is  one  mass  of  fantastic  psychology,  has  no  flesh  and  too  much  blood

(especially at the Last Supper, which was far too full-blooded for my taste.)

And then I cannot abide hysterical females. Much that can be tolerated by the

inner eye will scarcely be endured when it is produced on the stage. Imagine

our actors praying and quivering with distorted necks! Even the inside of the

Gralsberg  cannot  be  effective  on  the  stage,  and  the  same  applies  to  the

wounded swan. All these beautiful devices belong to the epic and are, as I

have said, for the inner eye of the imagination. The German sounds as if it

were a translation from a foreign tongue. But as for the situations and their

succession are they not in the highest sense poetical? Do they not constitute a

last challenge to music?

  Please be content with this for today, and with kindest regards to your

dear wife and yourself,

  I am, yours affectionately,

    NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To Malvida Von Meysenbug - June, 1878

  Bale, June 11, 1878.

  Who was it who thought of me on May 30?[59] I received two very fine

letters (from Gast and Ree)-and then something still finer: I was quite moved-

the fate of the man about whom for the last hundred years there have existed

only party prejudices loomed as a terrible symbol before my eyes. Towards

the emancipators of the spirit mankind is most irreconcilable in its hate, and

most unjust in its love. Albeit I shall go on my way in peace, and renounce

everything that might stand in my way. This is the decisive element in life:

were I not conscious of the superlative fruitfulness of my new philosophy, I

should  certainly  feel  frightfully  isolated  and  alone.  But  I  am  at  one  with

myself.

  Your heartily devoted friend,

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - March, 1879

  Bale, March 1, 1879.

  DEAR, KIND, HELPFUL FRIEND:

  There is now only one thing left to be done, and that is to try to get wellin Venice[60] My condition has again been simply appalling, next door to

intolerable.  "Am  I  fit  to  travel?"  The  question  I  kept  asking  myself  was

whether I should be alive by then.

    Provisional programme:

  On Tuesday evening, March 25, at about 7.45 I shall reach Venice, and

there  you  will  take  me  on  board.  Is  that  right?  You  will  hire  a  private

apartment for me (a room with a nice warm bed) which must be peaceful. If

possible secure a terrace or flat roof, either at your lodgings or mine, where

you and I will be able to sit out together, etc.

  I do not wish to see any sights, except by accident. All I want to do is to

sit on the Piazza San Marco in the sunshine and listen to the military band. I

always attend Mass at San Marco on f�te days. I shall silently roam about

the public gardens.

  I want to eat good figs and oysters, too, and follow the example of the

man of experience-yourself. I shall take no meals at the hotel.

  I require the utmost calm. I shall bring a few books with me. Warm baths

are to be had at Barbese (I have the address).

  You  will  receive  the  first  complete  copy  of  the  book.  Read  it  right

through again so that in it you may recognize yourself as retoucheur (as well

as myself; for, after all, I too, went to some pains in producing it).

  Good Heavens!-it is perhaps my last production. To my mind it is full of

intrepid repose.

  If you only knew how well and with what gratitude I always speak of

you! And what hopes I cherish about you!

  Now, for a while, be my good shepherd and medical adviser in Venice.

But it pains me to think that I am once more going to give you a lot of

trouble. I promise you, though, that I shall take up as little of your time as

possible.

  With hearty thanks, I am your friend,

    NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To His Mother And Sister - April, 1879

  Bale, April 25, 1879.

  Since my last card things have gone from bad to worse, in Geneva as in

Bale, whither I returned last Monday. I had attack after attack both there and

here. Until now I have been quite unable to give lectures. Yesterday Schiess

informed me that my eyesight had deteriorated considerably since he last

examined it.  Your letters, full of news and encouragement, reached me while I was

still in Geneva. My heartiest thanks!

  Nietzsche To The President Of The Educational Council - May, 1879

  Bale, May 2, 1879.

  DEAR SIR:

  The state of my health, which has forced me to address so many appeals

to you in the past, now urges me to take this last step and beg you to be so

good as to allow me to resign the post of Professor at the University which I

have held hitherto. All this time my headaches have increased so much that

they are now scarcely endurable; there is also the increasing loss of time

occasioned by my attacks of illness which last from two to six days, while I

have  once  more  been  told  by  Herr  Schiess  that  my  eyesight  has  again

deteriorated so much so that at present I am scarcely able to read or write for

twenty minutes at a time without pain. All these considerations force me to

recognize that I am no longer fit for my academic duties-nay, that I am no

longer equal to them and this after having been obliged during the last few

years to allow myself, always much to my regret, many an irregularity in the

discharge  of  these  duties.  It  would  redound  to  the  disadvantage  of  our

University, and to the philological studies pursued therein, were I any longer

to fill a post for which I have ceased to be suited. Nor can I say that I can any

longer entertain any hope of improvement in the state of my head, which

seems to have become chronically bad; as for years I have made attempt after

attempt to get rid of the trouble, and have led the most severely ordered life,

undergoing  privations  of  all  kinds-all  in  vain!  This  I  am  bound  to  admit

today, at a time when I have ceased to believe that I shall be able to resist my

suffering  much  longer.  I  have  no  other  alternative  therefore  than,  in

accordance with paragraph 20 of the University Statutes, with deep regret to

express the desire to be released from my duties, and also tender my thanks to

the University authorities for the many signs of kind indulgence they have

shown me from the first hour of my appointment to the present day.

  Begging you, Sir, kindly to convey my desire to the Board, I am and

remain,

  Your obedient servant,

  Bale, Beginning of May, 1879.  DEAR SIR:

  I have resigned my professorship and am going into the mountains. I am

on the verge of desperation and have scarcely any hope left. My sufferings

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - September, 1879

  Address, St. Moriz-Dorf, Poste Restante.

    September 11, 1879.

  DEAR, DEAR FRIEND:

  When you read these lines my MS. will already have reached you; it may

deliver its own request to you; I have not the courage to do so. But you must

share a few of the moments of joy that I now feel over my completed work. I

am at the end of my thirty-fifth year-"the middle of life," as people for a

century and a half used to say of this age. It was at this age that Dante had his

vision, and in the opening lines of his poem he mentions the fact. Now I am

in the middle of life and so "encircled by death" that at any minute it can lay

hold of me. From the nature of my sufferings I must reckon upon a sudden

death through convulsions (although I should prefer a hundred times a slow,

lucid death, before which I should be able to converse with my friends, even

if it were more painful). In this way I feel like the oldest of men, even from

the standpoint of having completed my life-task. I have poured out a salutary

drop of oil; this I know, and I shall not be forgotten for it. At bottom I have

already undergone the test of my own view of life: many more will have to

undergo it after me. Up to the present my spirit has not been depressed by the

unremitting suffering that my ailments have caused me; at times I even feel

more cheerful and more benevolent than I ever felt in my life before; to whatdo I owe this invigorating and ameliorating effect? Certainly not to my fellow

men; for, with but few exceptions, they have all during the last few years

shown themselves "offended" by me;[63] nor have they shrunk from letting

me know it. Just read this last MS. through, my dear friend, and ask yourself

whether there are any traces of suffering or depression to be found in it. I don

t believe there are, and this very belief is a sign that there must be powers

concealed in these views, and not the proofs of impotence and lassitude after

which my enemies will seek.

  Now I shall not rest until I have sent those pages, transcribed by my self-

sacrificing friend and revised by me, to my printers in Chemnitz. I shall not

come to you myself-however urgently the Overbecks and my sister may press

me to do so; there are states in which it seems to me more fitting to return to

the neighbourhood of one's mother, one's home, and the memories of one's

childhood. But do not take all this as final and irrevocable. According as his

hopes rise or fall, an invalid should be allowed to make or unmake his plans.

My  programme  for  the  summer  is  complete:  three  weeks  at  a  moderate

altitude (in Wiesen), three months in the Engadine, and the last month in

taking the real St. Moritz drink-cure, the best effect of which is not supposed

to be felt before the winter. This working out of a programme was a pleasure

to me, but it was not easy! Self-denial in everything (I had no friends, no

company; I could read no books; all art was far removed from me; a small

bedroom  with  a  bed,  the  food  of  an  ascetic-which  by  the  bye  suited  me

excellently, for I have had no indigestion the whole of the summer) this self-

denial was complete except for one point I gave myself up to my thoughts

what else could I do! Of course, this was the very worst thing for my head,

but I still do not see how I could have avoided it. But enough; this winter my

programme will be to recover from myself, to rest myself away from my

thoughts-for years I have not had this experience. Perhaps in Naumburg I

shall be able so to arrange my day as to profit by this repose. But first of all

the "sequel"-The Wanderer and his Shadow!

  Your last letter full of ideas pleased Overbeck and me so much that I

allowed him to take it with him to Zurich to read to his womenfolk there.

Forgive me for having done this. And forgive me for more important things!

  Your friend,

  N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - October, 1879

  Naumburg, October 5, 1879.  DEAR FRIEND:

    Yesterday  morning  I  posted  my  card  to  you;  and  three  hours  later  I

received fresh proof of your indefatigable kindness towards me. If only I

could fulfill your wishes! "But thoughts are too remote," as Tieck sings. You

would scarcely believe how faithfully I have carried out the programme of

thoughtlessness;  and  I  have  reasons  for  being  faithful  in  this  respect;  for

"behind thought stands the devil" [64] of a frantic attack of pain. The MS.

that reached you at St. Moritz was produced at such a very heavy price that

probably no one who could have helped it would ever have written it at such

cost.  I  am  now  often  filled  with  horror  when  reading  my  own  MSS.,

especially  the  more  lengthy  portions  owing  to  the  odious  memories  they

awaken. The whole of it, with the exception of a few lines, was thought out

while walking and scribbled down in pencil in six small note books; almost

every time I tried to re-write a passage, I failed. I was forced to omit about

twenty  somewhat  lengthy  lines  of  thought.  Unfortunately  they  were  most

important; but I had not the time to decipher my most illegible pencil scrawl.

The same thing happened to me last summer. I cannot after wards recall the

slender connection of thought. For, in order to steal away those minutes and

quarters of an hour of "cerebral energy" of which you speak, I have to rob

them from a suffering brain. At present I feel as if I could never do it again. I

read your transcript, and have all the difficulty in the world in understanding

myself-my head is so tired.

  The Sorrento MS. has gone to the deuce; my removal and final farewell

to Bale made many a radical change in my affairs and it was a good thing for

me, because old MSS. such as those always frown at me like debtors.

  Dear friend, as to Luther, it is a long time since I have been able with

honesty to say anything to his credit; this is the outcome of a mass of material

about him to which Jacob Burckhardt called my attention. I refer to Janssen's

"History of the German People" (Vol. II) that appeared this year (I have it).

The voice in this book is, for once, not that of a Protestant falsification of

history, which is the one we have been taught to believe. At present, the fact

that we prefer Luther as a man to Ignatius Loyola strikes me as being no

more than our national taste in north and south! That odious, arrogant, and

biliously-envious  diabolical  wrangling  affected  by  Luther-who  was  never

happy  unless  he  was  able  to  spit  on  someone  in  his  wrath-nauseated  me

beyond endurance. Certainly you are right when you speak of "the promotion

of European democratization" through Luther, but this raving enemy of thepeasant (who ordered them to be slaughtered like mad dogs, and himself

assured the princes that the kingdom of Heaven could be won by the killing

and  strangling  of  peasant  cattle)  was  certainly  one  of  its  most  unwilling

promo ters. Yours is, by-the-bye, the fairer attitude towards the man. But just

give me time! Many thanks to you also for the other lacunae you pointed out

to me. This is most impotent gratitude, I'm afraid. Here again my "wish of

wishes" occurs to me. Well, I have been thinking lately of my friend Gast, not

actually  as  an  author-there  are  so  many  ways  of  testifying  to  an  inward

condition of maturity and health attained. In the first place of you as an artist!

After Aeschylus came Sophocles! I would rather not tell you more plainly

what I hope. And now for a word of truth about you as a creature of brains

and heart: what a start you have of me, making allowance for the difference

of years, and that which years bring with them! Once more let me tell you a

home-truth:  I  consider  you  a  better  and  more  gifted  man  than  I  am,  and

consequently a man with greater obligations. . . .

  With sincere affection,

  Your friend whose hopes are in you,

  N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - July, 1880

    Marienbad, July 18, 1880.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  I still cannot help thinking several times a day of the delightful pampering

I had in Venice and of the still more delightful pamperer, and all I can say is

that one cannot have such good times for long and that it is only right I

should once more be an anchorite and as such go walking for ten hours a day,

drink  fateful  doses  of  water  and  await  their  effect.  Meanwhile  I  burrow

eagerly inside my moral mines and at times feel quite subterranean in the

process-at present I seem to feel as if I had now discovered the principal

artery and outlet. But this is the sort of belief that may return a hundred times

only to be rejected. Now and again an echo of Chopin's music rings in my

ears, and this much you have achieved, that at such moments I always think

of you and lose myself in meditating about possibilities. My trust in you has

grown very great; you are built much more soundly than I suspected, and

apart from the evil influence that Herr Nietzsche has exercised over you from

time  to  time,  you  are  in  every  respect  well  conditioned.  Ceterum  censeo

mountains and woods are better than towns and Paris is better than Vienna.

  On the way I made friends with a high dignitary of the Church, who wasapparently one of the earliest promoters of old Catholic music; he was up to

every question of detail. I found he was much interested in the work Wagner

did in regard to Palestrina's music. He said that dramatic recitative (in the

liturgy)  was  the  core  of  Church  music,  and  accordingly  wished  the

interpretation of such music to be as dramatic as possible. In his opinion

Regensburg was the only place on earth where old music could be studied

and above all heard (particularly in Passion week).

  Have you heard about the fire at Mommsen's[65] house and that his notes

have all been destroyed-perhaps the most extensive collection of documents

ever made by a living scholar? It appears that he dashed into the flames again

and again, and that at last, covered with burns as he was, they were obliged to

restrain him by force. Such tasks as the one Mommsen had undertaken must

be very rare; for the colossal memory and corresponding acumen in criticism

and  arrangement  necessary  for  dealing  with  such  a  mass  of  material  are

seldom united in one man; they are more often in conflict. When I heard of

the affair my heart was in my mouth with horror, and even now I feel genuine

physical anguish when I think of it. Is that pity? But what is Mommsen to

me? I am in no way favorably inclined towards him.

  Here in the lonely sylvan hermitage of which I am the hermit, there has

been a good deal of trouble ever since yesterday. I do not know exactly what

has happened, but the shadow of a crime seems to lie on the house. Someone

buried something; others discovered it; a good deal of lamentation was heard;

a number of gendarmes appeared on the scene; the house was searched and

during the night in the room next door to mine I heard someone sighing

heavily, as if in great pain, and I could not sleep. Then in the middle of the

night I heard sounds as if something were being buried in the wood, but

whoever was engaged in the work was surprised, and once more there were

tears and cries. An official told me that it was a "banknote" affair-I am not

sufficiently inquisitive to know as much about my surroundings as all the

world probably knows about me. Suffice it to say that the solitude of the

woods is uncanny.

  I have been reading a story by Merimee, in which Henry Beyle's character

is  said  to  be  described.  It  is  called  "The  Etruscan  Vase";  if  this  is  true,

Stendhal is St. Clair. The whole thing is ironical, distinguished and deeply

melancholic.

  In conclusion listen to an idea I have had: one ceases from loving oneself

properly when one ceases from exercising oneself in love towards others,wherefore the latter (the ceasing from exercising, etc.) ought to be strongly

deprecated. (This is from my own experience.)

  Fare you well, my beloved and much valued friend. May things go well

with you night and day.

  Your devoted,

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - August, 1880

    Marienbad, August 20, 1880.

  MY DEAR FRIEND GAST:

  Your letter chimed in with my harvest-, or rather harvest-festival mood, a

little dismally, it is true, but so well and powerfully that today I once more, as

usual, end my meditations about you with the chorale

  "What Gast achieved is well achieved,

  For just are his intentions. Amen."[66]

  You are built of stouter material than I am and you are entitled to set

yourself higher ideals. For my part I suffer terribly when I lack sympathy;

nothing can compensate me, for instance, for the fact that for the last few

years I have lost Wagner's friendly interest in my fate. How often do I not

dream of him, and always in the spirit of our former intimate companionship!

No words of anger have ever passed between us, not even in my dreams-on

the contrary, only words of encouragement and good cheer, and with no one

have I ever laughed so much as with him. All this is now a thing of the past-

and what does it avail that in many respects I am right and he is wrong? As if

our lost friendship could be forgotten on that account! And to think that I had

already  suffered  similar  experiences  before,  and  am  likely  to  suffer  them

again! They constitute the cruellest sacrifices that my path in life and thought

has exacted from me-and even now the whole of my philosophy totters after

one hour's sympathetic intercourse even with total strangers! It seems to me

so foolish to insist on being in the right at the expense of love, and not to be

able  to  impart  one's  best  for  fear  of  destroying  sympathy.  Hinc  meae

lacrimae.[67]

  I am still in Marienbad: the "Austrian weather" held me fast to the spot!

Fancy, it has rained every day since July 24, and sometimes the whole day

long. A rainy sky and rainy atmosphere, but fine walks in the woods. My

health lost ground withal; but, in summa I was well satisfied with Venice and

Marienbad. Certainly, never has so much been thought out here since the

days of Goethe,[68] and even Goethe cannot have let so many fundamentalthings pass through his head-I surpassed myself by a long way. Once in the

wood a man stared fixedly at me as he passed me by, and at that moment I

felt that my expression must have been one of radiant joy, and that I had

already worn it for two hours. Like the most modest of the visitors here, I live

incognito; in the visitors list I appear as "Schoolmaster Nietzsche." There are

a great many Poles here, and, strange to say, they insist upon it that I must be

a Pole; they actually come up to me to greet me in the Polish tongue, and will

not believe me when I tell them that I am a Swiss. "Your race is Polish, but

your  heart  has  turned  Heaven  knows  whither"-thus  did  one  of  them

mournfully take leave of me.

  Your devoted,

  F. N.

  To Herr Ob. Rer. R. Krug - November, 1880

    Genoa, November 16, 1880.

  MY DEAR GUSTAV:

  Here in Genoa I received the news of your bereavement, and I am just

writing a few lines in haste and unprepared, as the circumstances of travel

permit.  But  you  must  regard  them  more  as  a  sign  than  an  expression  of

sympathy. By-the-bye, I see from the calendar that it is also your birthday.

With what wistful eyes you will look back upon your life today. We grow

older and therefore lonelier; the love that leaves us is precisely that love

which was lavished upon us like an unconscious necessity-not owing to our

particular qualities, but often in spite of them. The curtain falls on our past

when our mother dies; it is then for the first time that our childhood and

youth be come nothing more than a memory. And then the same process

extends; the friends of our youth, our teachers, our ideals of those days, all

die, and every day we grow more lonely, and ever colder breezes blow about

us. You were right to plant another garden of love around you, dear friend! I

should think that to-day you are particularly grateful for your lot. Moreover

you have remained true to your art, and it was with the deepest satisfaction

that I heard all you had to tell me on that score. A period may be dawn ing

which may be better suited to my constitution than the present one-a period in

which we shall once again sit side by side and see the past rise up afresh out

of your music, just as in our youth we used to dream together of our future in

the music we both loved.

  I may not say more. My ailments (which still continue, as in the past, to

have  their  own  daily  history)  have  laid  their  tyrannical  hand  upon  me.Whenever you think of me (as you did for instance on my birth day, which,

this year, I had completely forgotten), please believe that I do not lack either

courage or patience, and that, even as things are at present, I aspire to high,

very high goals. You may also believe with equal certainty that I am and

remain your friend,

  With sincere affection and devotion,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  To Rohde - March, 1881

    Genoa, March 24, 1881.

  Thus the sands of life run out and the best of friends hear and see nothing

of  each  other!  Aye,  the  trick  is  no  easy  one-to  live  and  yet  not  to  be

discontented. How often do I not feel as if I should like to beg a loan from

my robust, flourishing and brave old friend Rohde, when I am in sore need of

a "transfusion" of strength, not of lamb's[69] but of lion's blood. But there he

dwells away in T�bingen, immersed in books and married life, and in every

respect inaccessible to me. Ah, dear friend, to live for ever on my own fat

seems to be my lot, or, as every one knows who has tried it, to drink my own

blood! Life then becomes a matter of not losing one's thirst for oneself and

also of not drinking oneself dry.

  On the whole, however, I am, to tell the truth, astonished at the number of

springs a man can set flowing in himself-even a man like myself who am not

one of the richest. I believe that if I possessed all the qualities in which you

excel me I should be puffed up with pride and insufferable. Even now there

are moments when I wander over the heights above Genoa here with glances

and hopes like those which dear old Columbus may perhaps have cast from

this very spot out over the sea and the whole of the future.

  Well, it is with these moments of courage and of foolishness too, perhaps,

that I have to adjust the equilibrium of my life's vessel-for you have no idea

how many days, and how many hours, even on endurable days, I have to

overcome, to say the least.

  As far as it is possible to alleviate and mitigate a bad state of health by

means of wise living I think I probably do all that can be done in my case-in

that respect I am neither thoughtless nor devoid of ideas. But I wish no one

the  lot  to  which  I  am  growing  accustomed,  because  I  am  beginning  to

understand that I am equal to it.

  But you, my dear good friend, are not in such a tight corner as to be

forced to grow thin in order to squeeze out of it; neither is Overbeck. Youboth  do  your  good  work  and,  without  saying  overmuch  about  it,  perhaps

without even being conscious of it, derive all that is good from the midday of

life-with some sweat of your brow, too, I suppose. How glad I should be to

have a word or two from you about your plans, your great plans-for with a

head and a heart like yours, behind all the daily routine of work, petty enough

perhaps, a man always carries something bulky and very big about with him-

how  happy  you  would  make  me  if  you  held  me  not  unworthy  of  such

confidence!  Friends  like  yourself  must  help  me  to  sustain  my  belief  in

myself, and this you do when you confide in me about your highest aims and

hopes. Beneath these words does there lurk the request for a letter from you?

Well,  yes,  dearest  friend,  I  should  rejoice  at  receiving  something  really

personal from you once more if only not always to have the Rohde of the past

in my heart, but also the Rohde of the present and, what is more, the Rohde

who is developing and willing-yes, the Rohde of the future.

    Affectionately yours,

  N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - April, 1881

    Genoa, 10-4-81.

  When I read your letter yesterday "my heart leaped" as the hymn says-it

would have been quite impossible, at the present moment, to have given me

more pleasant news! (The book, for which I have gradually developed quite a

decent appetite, will certainly be in my hands today.) Very well, so be it! We

two shall once more come together upon this ledge of life commanding such

a vast prospect, and we shall be able to look backwards and forwards together

and hold each other's hand the while to show how many, many good things

we  have  in  common-many  more  than  words  can  tell.  You  can  scarcely

imagine how exhilarating the prospect of this meeting is to me-for a man

alone with his thoughts passes for a fool, and often enough seems a fool to

himself  into  the  bargain;  when  two  come  together,  however,  "wisdom"

begins, as well as trust, courage, and mental health. Fare thee well! With my

best thanks,

  Your friend,

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To His Sister - June, 1881

    Recoaro, June 19, 1881.

  Oh, my darling sister, you imagine that it is all about a book? Do you too

still think that I am an author! My hour is at hand! I should like to spare youall this; for surely you cannot bear my burden (it is enough of a fatality to be

so closely related to me). I should like you to be able to say with a clean

conscience, to each and everyone, "I do not know my brothers latest views."

(People will be only too ready to acquaint you with the fact that they are

"immoral"  and  "shameless".)  Meanwhile,  courage  and  pluck;  to  each  his

appointed task, and the same old love!

  YOUR F.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - August, 1881

    Sils-Maria, August 14, 1881.

  Well, my dear friend! The August sun is above us, the year is slipping by,

the hills and the woods are growing more calm and more peaceful. Thoughts

have loomed upon my horizon the like of which I have not known before-I

shall not divulge anything about them, but shall remain imperturbably calm. I

shall have to live a few years longer ! Ah, my friend, sometimes I have a

feeling that I am leading a most dangerous life, for I belong to the kind of

machine  that  can  fly  to  pieces.  The  intensity  of  my  feelings  makes  me

shudder and laugh once or twice already I have been unable to leave my

room for the absurd reason that my eyes were inflamed-by what? On each

occasion I had wept too much on my wanderings the day before and not

sentimental  tears  by  any  means,  but  tears  of  joy  and  exaltation.  At  such

moments I sang and uttered nonsense, filled with a new vision which I had

seen in advance of the rest of mankind.

  After all-if I could not draw my strength from myself; if I had to wait for

words of good cheer, of encouragement, and of comfort from outside, where

should I be, what should I be! There have indeed been moments-nay, whole

periods in my life (the year 1878, for instance)-when I should have regarded

a strong cheering word, a sympathetic handshake, as the comfort of comforts-

and it was precisely then that every one on whom I thought I could rely, and

who could have done me this act of kindness, left me in the lurch. Now I no

longer expect it, and all I feel is a certain gloomy astonishment when, for

instance,  I  think  of  the  letters  that  reach  me  nowadays-they  are  all  so

insignificant! No one seems to have gained the smallest experience through

me, or to have thought about me-all that people say to me is decent and

benevolent, but so far, far away. Even our dear old Jacob Burchkardt wrote

me a faint hearted little letter of this sort.

  On the other hand I regard it as my reward that this year has shown me

two things that belong to me and that are intimately related to me-I refer toyour  music  and  the  landscape  before  me.  This  is  neither  Switzerland  nor

Recoaro, but something quite different; in any case something much more

southern- I should have to go to the Mexican plateau on the calm ocean, to

find anything like it (Oaxaca, for instance); and then, of course, it would be

covered with tropical vegetation. Well, I shall try to keep this Sils-Maria for

myself. And I feel just the same about your music, but I am quite at a loss to

know how to catch hold of it! I have been obliged to rule the reading of

music and the playing of the piano out of my occupations once and for all. I

have been thinking of buying a typewriter and am now in correspondence

with the inventor, a Dane of Copenhagen.

  What are you going to do next winter? I suppose you will be in Vienna.

But we must try to arrange a meeting for the following winter, if only a short

one-for now I am well aware that I am not fit to be your companion, and that

your spirit is more free and more fruitful when I have vanished from your

side. On the other hand, the ever-increasing emancipation of your feelings

and  your  acquisition  of  a  deep  and  proud  understanding,  in  summa  your

joyful, most joyful industry and development, means so indescribably much

to me, that I would readily adapt myself to any situation created by the needs

of your nature. Never do I have any unpleasant feelings about you-of this you

may be quite sure, dear friend! . . .

  With hearty affection and gratitude,

  YOUR F. N.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - August, 1881

  MY DEAR MOTHER:

    Sils-Maria, August 24, 1881.

  . . . I am very well satisfied with my food: Mid day (11.30 a.m.) every

day a dish of meat with macaroni; morning (6.30 a.m.) the yolk of a raw egg,

tea, and aniseed biscuit (bucolic and nourishing). Evening (6.30 p. m.), the

yolks of two raw eggs, a piece of Polenta[70] (as it is eaten by all shepherds

and peasants), tea (second infusion) and aniseed biscuit. (In Genoa I live

much more in conformity with the customs of the inhabitants, in fact as the

work people live.) Every morning at 5, general ablutions in cold water, and 5

to 7 hours exercise every day. Between 7 and 9 in the evening I sit still in the

dark (I also did this at Genoa, where, without exception, I stayed at home

every evening from 6 in the evening onwards; never went to a theatre or a

concert). You cannot imagine with what miserly care I have to husband myintellectual strength and my time, in order that such a suffering and imperfect

creature may yet be able to bear ripe fruit. Do not think ill of me for leading

this difficult sort of life; every hour of the day I have to be hard towards

myself.

  With love,

  Your F.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - August, 1881

    Sils-Maria, end of August, 1881.

  But this is splendid news, my dear friend! Above all that you should have

finished! At the thought of this first great achievement of your life, I feel

indescribably happy and solemn; I shall not fail to remember August 24,

1881! How things are progressing! But as soon as I think of your work I am

overcome by a feeling of satisfaction and a sort of emotion which I never

experience in connection with my own "works." There is something in these

that  always  fills  me  with  a  sense  of  shame;  they  are  counterfeits  of  a

suffering, imperfect nature, but inadequately equipped with the most essential

organs-to myself, I, as a whole, often seem little more than the scratching

upon a piece of paper made by an unknown power with the object of trying a

new pen? (Our friend Schmeitzner has understood very well how to make me

feel this, for in every one of his letters of late he has laid stress on the fact

that "my readers do not wish to read any more of my aphorisms.") As for

you,  my  dear  friend,  you  were  not  intended  to  be  such  a  creature  of

aphorisms; your aim is a lofty one; unlike me you do not feel obliged to let

people guess at the interdependence and at the need of interdependence in

your work. Your mission it is once more to make known the higher laws of

style  in  your  art-those  laws  the  setting  aside  of  which  the  weakness  of

modern artists has elevated almost to a principle: your mission it is to reveal

your art once more quite complete! This is what I feel when I think of you,

and in this prospect I seem to enjoy the fullest bloom of my own nature as in

a mirage. You alone have afforded me this joy up to the present, and it is only

since I learnt to know your music that this has been so between us.

  And now for the second piece of news: Vienna is coming to Venice and

the mountain to Mohammed! What a weight this takes off my mind! Now I

see  quite  clearly  the  course  things  will  take,  your  first  ceremonious

introduction-I  presume  you  will  have  the  courage  to  make  known  to  the

world your new will in aesthetics by means of one or two eloquent essays,

and  thus  obviate  misunderstanding  concerning  the  only  admissibleinterpretation of your work. Do not be afraid of confessing yourself vowed to

the loftiest motives! Men like yourself must cast their words ahead and must

know how to overtake them by their deeds (even I have allowed myself to act

on this principle until now). Avail yourself of all those liberties which are

still granted to the artist alone, and do not fail to remember that our task is in

all circumstances to urge people on, to urge them hence-almost irrespective

of whether we ourselves get there! (To my surprise I often find the exhortatio

indirecta  in  my  last  book;[71]  for  instance  in  the  542nd  Aphorism  "The

Philosopher and Old Age"-the direct form of exhortation and instigation, on

the other hand, savours somewhat of priggishness.)

  So much for today-it is not at all necessary for you to answer this, dear

friend. When we meet again you will play me some of your music as an

answer (during the last few months it has percolated right into my heart, and,

honestly, I know nothing I would like to hear better . . . ) .

  Your friend, NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - November, 1881

    Genoa, November 28, 1881.

  Hurrah! Friend! I have made the acquaintance of one more good thing, an

opera by Georges Bizet (who is he?): Carmen. It sounded like a story by

Merimee; ingenious, strong, and here and there staggering. A real French

talent for comic opera, absolutely uncorrupted by Wagner, on the other hand

a true pupil of Hector Berlioz. I thought something of the kind might be

possible.  It  looks  as  if  the  French  were  on  the  road  to  better  things  in

dramatic music; and they are far ahead of the Germans in one important

point; passion with them is not such a very far-fetched affair (as all passion is

in Wagner's works).

  Today I am not very well, but that is owing to bad weather and not to the

music ; maybe I should be even worse than I am if I had not heard it. Good

things are my medicine. Hence my love of you!

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - December, 1881

    Genoa, December 5, 1881.

  DEAR GOOD FRIEND:

  From  time  to  time  (how  is  this?)  it  is  almost  a  need  for  me  to  hear

something general and absolute about Wagner, and I like to hear it best of all

from you! To feel alike about Chamfort too ought to be a point of honour for

us both; he was a man of the stamp of Mirabeau in character, heart, and

magnanimity; this was Mirabeau's own opinion of his friend.  It  was  a  great  blow  to  me  to  hear  that  Bizet  is  dead.  I  have  heard

"Carmen" for the second time-and once more I had the impression of a first-

class story by Merimee, for instance. Such a passionate and fascinating soul!

In my opinion this work is worth a whole journey to Spain-a southern work

in the highest degree! Do not laugh, old friend, I do not so easily make an

utter mistake in "taste."

  With hearty gratitude, yours,

  N.

    Meanwhile I have been very ill, but am well, thanks to Carmen.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - January, 1882

    Genoa, January 29, 1882.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  Herr  von  B�low  has  the  ill-breeding  of  Prussian  officers  in  his

constitution;[72] he is, however, an "honest man"-the fact that he will no

longer have anything to do with German opera music is accounted for by all

kinds of secret reasons. I remember his once saying to me: "I do not know

Wagner's later music." Go to Bayreuth in the summer and you will find the

whole  theatrical  world  of  Germany  assembled  there,  even  Prince

Lichtenstein, etc., etc., Levi,[73] too. I suppose all my friends will be there,

my sister as well, after your letter of yesterday (and I am very glad of it).

  If I were with you I should introduce Horace's satires and letters to you-I

feel that we are both ripe and ready for them. When I glanced into them

today, I thought all the expressions were charming, as charming as a warm

winter's day.

  My last letter struck you as being "frivolous," didn't it? Have patience! In

respect of my "thoughts," it is nothing to me to have them-but to get rid of

them when I should like to do so is always infernally difficult for me!

  Oh, what days we are having! Oh, the wonder of this beautiful January!

Let us be of good cheer, dearest friend!

  To Herr. Ob. Reg. R. Krug - February, 1882

    Genoa, February, 1882.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  Your songs affected me strangely. One fine afternoon I happened to think

of all your music and musical talent and at last I asked myself why on earth

you did not get something printed. And then my ears rang with a line from

Jung Niklas. The following morning my friend Ree arrived at Genoa and

handed me your first book, and when I opened it, what was the first thing Isaw but Jung Niklas! This would be a good anecdote for the Spiritualists!

Your music has qualities which are rare nowadays. In my opinion all modern

music seems to be suffering from an ever increasing atrophy of the sense of

melody. Melody, as the last and most sublime art of arts, is ruled by logical

laws which our anarchists would like to decry as tyranny! But the one thing I

am certain about is that they are unable to reach up to these sweetest and

ripest of fruits. I recommend all composers the following most delightful

ascetic regimen-for a while to regard harmony as undiscovered, and to collect

a store of pure melodies from Beethoven and Chopin, for instance. Much of

the excellent past reaches my ears through your music and, as you perceive,

some of the future as well.

  I thank you most heartily.

  Yours,

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To His Sister - February, 1882

    Genoa, February 3, 1882.

  Just a few lines, my darling sister, to thank you for your kind words about

Wagner and Bayreuth. Certainly the time I spent with him in Triebschen and

enjoyed through him at Bayreuth (in 1872, not in 1876) is the happiest I have

had in my whole life. But the omnipotent violence of our tasks drove us

asunder and now we can never more be united; we have grown too strange to

each other.

  The day I found Wagner I was happy beyond description. So long had I

been seeking for the man who stood on a higher plane than I did, and who

really comprised me. I believed I had found this man in Wagner. It was a

mistake. And now it would not even be right to compare myself with him-I

be long to another order of beings.

  In any case I have had to pay dearly for my craze for Wagner. Has not the

nerve-destroying power of his music ruined my health-was it not dangerous

to life? Has it not taken me almost six years to recover from this pain? No,

Bayreuth is impossible for me! What I wrote a day or two ago was only a

joke. But you at all events must go to Bayreuth. Your going would be of the

greatest value to me.

  YOUR DEVOTED BROTHER.

  To Rohde - July, 1882

    Tantenberg, July 15, 1882.

  MY DEAR OLD FRIEND:  It cannot be helped; today I must prepare you for a new book from my

pen; you have at most another month's peace before it will reach you. There

is this extenuating circumstance, that it will be the last for many a long year-

for in the autumn I am going to the University of Vienna to begin student life

afresh, after having made somewhat of a failure of the old life, thanks to a too

one-sided study of philology. Now I have my own plan of study and behind it

my own secret goal to which the remaining years of my life are consecrated. I

find it too hard to live if I cannot do so in the grand style-this in confidence to

you, my old comrade! Without a goal that I could regard as inexpressibly

important I should not have been able to hold myself aloft in the light above

the black floods. This is really my only excuse for the sort of literature I have

been producing ever since 1875; it is my recipe, my self-concocted medicine

against the disgust of life. What years they have been! What lingering agony!

What inward strife, upheavals, and isolation! Who has ever endured as much

as  I?  Certainly  not  Leopardi.  And  if  today  I  stand  above  it  all  with  the

courage of a conqueror and laden with weighty new plans-and, if I know

myself,  with  the  prospect  of  even  harder  and  more  secret  sorrows  and

tragedies, and with the courage to meet them-then no one has the right to

blame me if I think well of my medicine. Mihi ipsi scripsi[74]-that settles it.

And so let everyone do the best he can for himself-that is my moral-the only

one I have left. Even if my bodily health returns, to whom do I owe this

change? In every respect I have been my own doctor, and as everything in me

is one I was obliged to treat my soul, my mind, and my body all at once and

with the same remedies. I admit that others would have perished from my

treatment, but that is why I am so eager in warning people against myself.

This last book, which bears the title of "The Joyful Wisdom," will act as a

special danger signal to many, even to you perhaps, dear old friend Rohde! It

contains a portrait of myself and I am convinced it is not the portrait of me

which you carry in your heart.

  Well, then, have patience even if only because you must realize that with

me it is "aut mori aut ita vivere"[75]

  Yours very affectionately,

    NIETZSCHE.

  To Madame Louise O. - September, 1882

  Naumburg, September, 1882.

  VERY DEAR FRIEND:

  Or am I not allowed to use this word after six years?    Meanwhile  I  have  been  living  nearer  to  death  than  to  life,  and  have

consequently become a little too much of a "sage" or almost a "saint." . . .

  Still, such things may perhaps be cured! For once again I believe in life,

in men, in Paris, and even in myself; and very shortly I shall see you again.

My last book is called "The Joyful Wisdom."

  Are the skies bright and cheerful in Paris? Do you happen to know of any

room that would suit my requirements? It would have to be an apartment

silent as death and very simply furnished-and not too far away from you, my

dear Madame. . . .

  Or do you advise me not to come to Paris? Perhaps it is not the place for

anchorites  and  men  who  wish  to  go  silently  about  their  life-work,  caring

nothing for politics and the present?

  You have no idea what a charming memory you are to me.

    Cordially yours,

    PROFESSOR DR. F. NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - February, 1883

    Rapallo, February 1, 1883.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  . . . But perhaps it would please you to hear what there is to be finished

and  printed.  It  is  a  question  of  a  very  small  book-of  about  one  hundred

printed pages only. But it is my best work, and with it I have removed a

heavy stone from my soul. I have never done anything more serious or more

cheerful; it is my hearty desire that this colour-which does not even need to

be a mixed colour-should become ever more and more my "natural" colour.

The book, is to be called :

  THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA

  A Book for All and None

  by

  F. N.

  With  this  work  I  have  entered  a  new  "Ring"-henceforward  I  shall  be

regarded as a madman in Germany. It is a wonderful kind of "moral lecture."

My sojourn in Germany has forced me to exactly the same point of view as

yours did, dear friend-that is to say, that I no longer form part of her. And

now, at least, after my Zarathustra, I also feel as you feel: this insight and the

establishing of one's attitude have given me courage.

  Where do we now belong? Let us rejoice that we should be allowed to

ask ourselves this question at all!  Our  experiences  have  been  somewhat  similar;  but  you  have  this

advantage over me-a better temperament, a better, calmer, and more lonely

past-and better health than I have.

  Well, then, I shall remain here until the 10th. After that my address will

be Roma, poste restante. Ever with you in thought and wish,

  F.N.

  You have delighted the Overbecks and myself as well!

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - February, 1883

  Kapallo, February 19, 1883.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  Every one of your last letters was a boon to me; I thank you for them

from the bottom of my heart. This winter has been the worst I have ever had

in my life, and I regard myself as a victim of a meteorological disturbance.

The old flood for the sins of Europe is still too much for me; but perhaps

some one may yet come to my rescue and help me up to the highlands of

Mexico. The only thing is that I cannot undertake such journeys; my eyes and

one or two other things forbid it.

  The appalling burden which, thanks to the weather, is now weighing me

down (even old Etna has now begun to rage!) has transformed itself into

thoughts and feelings the pressure of which is frightful; and from the sudden

detachment of this burden, as the result of the ten absolutely cheerful and

bracing days we had in January, my Zarathustra was born, the most detached

of all my productions. Tr�bner is already printing it, and I myself prepared

the copy for press. Moreover Schmeitzner writes to say that during the last

few years all my works have had a better sale, and I have received many

other tokens of increasing sympathy. Even a member of the Reichstag, a

follower of Bismarck (Delbr�ck[76]) is said to have expressed himself in

terms of the utmost vexation over the fact that I lived not in Berlin but in

Santa Margherita!

  Forgive this chatter; you know what else I now have in my mind and next

my heart. I was very ill indeed for a day or two, and made my hosts quite

anxious. I am better now and I even believe that Wagner's death was the most

substantial relief that could have been given me just now. It was hard for six

years to have to be the opponent of the man one had most reverenced on

earth, and my constitution is not sufficiently coarse for such a position. After

all it was Wagner grown senile whom I was forced to resist; as to the genuine

Wagner, I shall yet attempt to become in a great measure his heir (as I haveoften  assured  Fr�ulein  Malvida,  though  she  would  not  believe  it).  Last

summer I felt that he had alienated all those men from me who were the only

ones in Germany I might have influenced to some purpose, and had inveigled

them into the confused and wild hostility of his last years.

  I need hardly say that I have of course written to Cosima.

  As to what you say about Lou, I could not help having a good laugh. Do

you really believe that in this matter my taste differs from your own? No,

certainly not! But in the case in point there was damned little question of "the

attraction  of  loveliness  or  the  reverse,"  but  only  whether  a  highly  gifted

human being was to be brought to naught or not.

  So the proofs may once more be sent to you for correction, my old and

helpful friend? My heartiest thanks for it all.

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - March, 1883

    Genoa, March 22, 1883.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  I saw "Carmen" again last night-it was perhaps the twentieth performance

this year; the house was packed to overflowing as usual; it is the opera of

operas here. You ought to hear the death-like silence that reigns when the

Genoese listen to their favourite piece-the prelude to the fourth act, and the

yells for an encore that follow. They are also very fond of the "Tarantella."

Well, dear old friend, I too was very happy once again; when this music is

played some very deep stratum seems to be stirred in me, and while listening

to it I always feel resolved to hold out to the end and to unburden my heart of

its  supremest  malice  rather  than  perish  beneath  the  weight  of  my  own

thoughts. During the performance I did little else than compose Dionysian

songs, in which I made so bold as to say the most terrible things in the most

terrible and laughable manner. This is the latest form my madness has taken.

  Forgive me for writing so often. I have so few people to confide in now.

  Your devoted

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - April, 1883

    Genoa, April 27, 1883.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  . . . And last of all came Wagner's death. What recollections did not this

news  bring  back  to  me!  The  whole  of  this  relationship  and  broken

relationship with Wagner has proved my severest trial in connection with myjustice  toward  people  in  general,  and  of  late  I  had  at  last  succeeded  in

practising that "indolence" in this matter of which you write. And what on

earth could be more melancholy than indolence, when I think of those times

in which the latter part of "Siegfried" was written! Then we loved each other

and hoped everything for each other -it was truly a profound love, free from

all arri�repensee. . . .

  Your friend,

    NIETZSCHE.

  To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - June, 1883

    Sils-Maria, June 28, 1883.

  MY DEAR OLD FRIEND GERSDORFF:

  I have just heard of the terrible blow that has befallen you in the loss of

your mother. When I learnt it, I derived genuine comfort from the thought

that at least you are not alone in life, and called to mind the cordial and

grateful words with which you spoke to me of your life companion in your

last letter. You and I have been through some rough times in our youth-rough

for many reasons-and it would be only just and proper for our manhood to be

blessed with milder, more comforting and encouraging experiences.

  As for myself, a long and arduous asceticism of the spirit lies behind me,

which I undertook quite voluntarily, though it would not be right for every

body to expect it of himself. The last six years have, in this respect, been the

years  of  my  severest  efforts  in  self-control,  and  this  is  leaving  out  of  all

reckoning what I have had to overcome in the way of ill-health, solitude,

misunderstanding, and persecution. Suffice it to say that I have overcome this

stage in my life-and I shall use all that remains of life (not much, I imagine)

in giving full and complete expression to the object for which I have so far

endured life at all. The period of silence is over. My Zarathustra, which will

be sent to you in a week or so, will perhaps show you to what lofty heights

my will has soared. Do not be deceived by the legendary character of this

little  book.  Beneath  all  these  simple  but  outlandish  words  lie  my  whole

philosophy and the things about which I am most in earnest. It is my first step

in making myself known-nothing more! I know perfectly well that there is no

one alive who could create anything like this Zarathustra.

  Well, my dear old friend, I am once more in the Ober-Engadine. This is

my third visit to the place and once again I feel that my proper lair and home

is here and nowhere else. Oh, how much that wishes to become word and

form still lies concealed within me! I cannot be too quiet, I cannot standsufficiently high up, I cannot be too much alone, if I wish to hear the voices

that are buried deepest within me.

  I should like to have enough money to build myself a sort of ideal dog-

kennel-I mean, a wooden hut with two rooms, on a peninsula jutting out into

the Silser Lake, where a Roman castle once stood. Living in these peasants

cottages, as I have done hitherto, has in the end become unendurable. The

rooms  are  low  and  confined,  and  there  is  always  a  good  deal  of  noise.

Otherwise the people of Sils-Maria are very kindly disposed to me and I think

well of them. I board at the Edelweiss Hotel, an excellent hostelry. Of course

I take my meals alone there at a price which is not altogether out of keeping

with my slender means. I brought a large basketful of books with me to this

place, so I am once more fixed up for a spell of three months. My Muses live

here; in the Wanderer and his Shadow I have already said that this region is

"related to me by blood and something more." . . .

  Yours,

    FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

  DEAR FRIEND GAST:

  How is it that I have not written to you for such an age? I have just asked

myself this question. But all this time I have felt so uncertain and irresolute.

A  breath  of  illness  still  hung  about  me,  and  so  I  did  not  wish  to  write

(unfortunately I have written far too many letters this winter that are full of

illness). Besides which a number of things have gone wrong with me, for

instance, my attempt to find a summer abode for myself in Italy. I tried first

in  the  Volscian  mountains,  and  again  in  the  Abruzzi  (in  Aquila).  What  I

wonder at now is why, every year about spring time, I feel such a violent

impulse to go ever further south; this year to Rome, last year to Messina, and

two years ago I was on the very point of embarking for Tunis-when the war

broke out. The explanation must be this, that throughout every winter I suffer

so terribly from the cold (three winters without a fire!) that with the coming

of the warmer weather a veritable craving for warmth takes possession of me.

This year I felt in addition a craving for the society of my fellow men. I mean

a human kind of relationship, and particularly for a more human kind of

society than I enjoyed last spring. Truth to tell, now that I can look back on it

all, my lot during the whole of last year and this winter has been of the most

horrible and forbidding kind; and I marvel at the fact that I have escaped it allwith my life-I marvel and I shudder, too. In Rome people showed me plenty

of kindness and good nature, and those who have been good to me are more

than ever so now.

  As to Zarathustra, I have just heard that it is still "awaiting dispatch" in

Leipzig; even the complimentary copies. This is owing to the "very important

conferences" and constant journeyings of the chief of the Alliance Antijuive,

Heir Schmeitzner. On that account "the publishing business must for once

mark time for a bit," he writes. It really is too ludicrous; first the Christian

obstruction, the 500,000 hymn books, and now the anti-Semitic obstruction

these are truly experiences for the founder of a religion.

  Malvida and my sister were astonished to find Zarathustra so bitter (so

embittered); I-how sweet. De gustibus, etc.[77]

  Now I am once again in my beloved Sils-Maria in the Engadine, the spot

where I hope one day to die; meanwhile it offers me the best incentive to live

on.  On  the  whole  I  am  remarkably  undecided,  shaken,  and  full  of

questionings; up here it is cold, and that holds me together and braces me. . . .

  I shall be here three months, but after that what? Oh the future! Nearly

every day I wonder how I shall ever come to hear your music again. I miss it.

I know of so few things that thoroughly refresh me. But Sils-Maria and your

music are among them.

  Your last letter contains a number of very fine thoughts, for which I truly

thank myself. Afterward I had another look at Epicurus's bust. Will power

and intellectuality are its most salient characteristics.

  Your ever heartily devoted,

  F. N.

    Sils-Maria, 13 July, 1883.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  Since my last letter I have been better, my spirits have improved, and all

of a sudden I have conceived the second part of "Thus Spake Zarathustra."

The birth followed upon the conception; the whole thing was worked out

with the greatest vehemence.

  (While  working  upon  it,  the  thought  struck  me  that  one  day  I  should

probably die from an outburst and overflow of emotion like this: the devil

take me!)

  The MS. will be ready for press the day after tomorrow morning, and my

eyes describe limits to my industry.  If you read the last page of Zarathustra, Part I, you will find the words: "-

and only when ye have all denied me will I return unto you."

  "Verily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones, with

another love shall I then love you."[78]

  This  is  the  motto  to  the  Second  Part:  out  of  it-as  it  would  be  almost

foolish to tell a musician, I evolve different harmonies and modulations from

those in Part I.

  It was chiefly a matter of climbing on to the second rung, in order from

this position, to reach the third (the title of which is "Midday and Eternity." I

have already told you this; but I beg you most earnestly not to speak about it

to anyone. As for the third part, I'll allow myself some time, and for the

fourth, perhaps years-)

  If, now, I ask you again kindly to help me with the correction of my

proofs-this request exceeds the bounds of all friendship and decency, and if

you cannot contrive to justify me in my request I cannot contrive to make it!

  Your devoted friend,

    NIETZSCHE.

  To Peter Gast - August, 1883

    Sils-Maria, 3rd August, 1883.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:

  Epicurus  is  precisely  the  best  negative  argument  in  favour  of  my

challenge  to  all  rare  spirits  to  isolate  themselves  from  the  mass  of  their

fellows; up to the present the world has made him pay, as it did even in his

own day, for the fact that he allowed himself to be confused with others, and

that he treated the question of public opinion about himself with levity, with

godlike levity. Already in the last days of his fame, the swine broke into his

garden, and it is one of the ironies of fate, that we have to believe a Seneca in

favour of Epicurean manliness and loftiness of soul-Seneca, a man to whom

one should, on the whole, always lend an ear, but never give one's faith and

trust. In Corsica people say: Seneca � un birbone.[79]

  Your friend,

    NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To His Mother - August, 1883

    Sils-Maria, August, 1883.

  MY DEAR MOTHER:

  I have received everything in the way of food and the necessaries of life-

unfortunately, too, your letter, which made me feel very wretched. Really,these dissertations on Christianity and on the opinions of this man and that as

to what I should do and ought to think on the subject should no longer be

directed to my address. My patience won't stand it! The atmosphere in which

you  live,  among  these  "good  Christians,"  with  their  one-sided  and  often

presumptuous  judgments,  is  as  opposed  as  it  possibly  can  be  to  my  own

feelings and most remote aims. I do not say anything about it, but I know that

if people of this kind, even including my mother and sister, had an inkling of

what  I  am  aiming  at,  they  would  have  no  alternative  but  to  become  my

natural enemies. This cannot be helped; the reasons for it lie in the nature of

things. It spoils my love of life to live among such people, and I have to

exercise considerable self-control in order not to react constantly against this

sanctimonious atmosphere of Naumburg (in which I include many uncles and

aunts who do not live in Naumburg).

  Let us, my dear mother, do as we have done hither to, and avoid all these

serious questions in our letters. Moreover, I doubt whether our Lizzie could

have read your letter.

  My spirits and health have once more been very much impaired by the

fact that the ghastly affair of last year is once more abroad and adding woe to

woe. As to the ultimate outcome of it all, as far as I am concerned, ever since

last August I have had the most gloomy forebodings. I am now working like

a man who is "putting his house in order before departing." Don't say any

more about it. I shall not either, and forgive me if this letter has turned out to

be such a melancholy effusion.

  Your son,

  FRITZ.

    Sils-Maria, August 16, 1883.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  Where do you get all these delightful Epicurea? I mean not only your

Epicurea  epigrams  but  everything  reminiscent  of  the  air  and  fragrance  of

Epicurus's garden that has emanated from all your letters of late. Oh, I am so

badly in need of such things including that divine feat "eluding the masses."

For, truth to tell, I am well nigh crushed to death.

  But let me change the subject.

  The fate of the Island of Ischia[80] makes me more and more miserable,

for apart from those features about it that concern all men, there is something

in  the  event  that  hits  very  near  home  where  I  am  concerned  and  in  apeculiarly terrible way. This island was so dear to me; if you have finished

the second part of Zarathustra, where I speak of seeking my "Happy Isles,"

this  will  be  clear  to  you.  "Cupid  dancing  with  the  maidens"  can  only  be

grasped  immediately  in  Ischia  (the  girls  of  Ischia  speak  of  "Cupido".)

Scarcely have I finished my poem than the island goes to bits. You remember

that the very hour I passed the first part of Zarathustra for press Wagner died.

On this occasion, at the corresponding hour, I received news that made me so

indignant that there will in all probability be a duel with pistols this autumn.

[81] Silentium! Dear friend!

    Meanwhile I have drafted out a plan of a "morality for Moralists," and

readjusted  and  rectified  my  views  in  many  ways.  The  unconscious  and

involuntary congruity of thought and coherence prevalent in the multifarious

mass of my later books has astonished me; one cannot escape from oneself;

that  is  why  one  should  dare  to  let  oneself  go  ever  further  in  one's  own

personality.

  I confess that what I should most like at present would be for some one

else to compile a sort of digest of the results of all my thought, and thereby

draw a comparison between me and all other thinkers up to my time. Out of a

veritable abyss of the most undeserved and most enduring contempt in which

the whole of my work and endeavour has lain since the year 1876, I long for

a word of wisdom concerning myself.

  Yours,

    NIETZSCHE.

    Sils-Maria, August 26, 1883.

  How your letter overjoyed me once again, my Venetian friend! That is

what I call "Lectures on Greek Culture" to one who needs them and not to an

audience of Leipzig students et hoc genus omne![82]

  For a whole year I have been goaded on to a class of feelings which with

the best will in the world I had abjured, and which at least in their more gross

manifestations-I  really  thought  I  had  mastered;  I  refer  to  the  feelings  of

revenge and "resentment."

  The idea of delivering lectures in Leipzig partook of the nature of despair-

I wished to find distraction in the hardest daily toil without being thrown

back on my ultimate tasks. But the idea has already been abandoned, and

Heinze, the present Hector of the University, has made it clear to me that my

attempt  at  Leipzig  would  have  been  a  failure  (just  as  it  would  be  at  allGerman Universities) owing to the fact that the Faculty would never dare to

recommend me to the Board of Education in view of my attitude towards

Christianity  and  the  concept  of  God.  Bravo!  This  expression  of  opinion

restored my courage to me.[83]

  Even the first criticism of the first part of Zarathustra that I have received

(written  by  a  Christian  and  anti-Semite  to  boot,  and  strangely  enough

produced in a prison) gives me courage, seeing that in it the popular attitude,

which is the only one in me that can be grasped to wit, my attitude towards

Christianity-was immediately, distinctly and well understood. "Aut Christ us

aut Zarathustra![84] Or, to put it plainly, the old long-promised Anti-Christ

has come to the fore-that is what my readers feel. And so all the defenders "of

our creed and of the Saviour of Mankind" are solemnly mustered ("gird up

your loins with the sword of the Holy Ghost"!!) against Zarathustra, and then

it goes on: "If he conquers you, he will be yours and he will be true, for in

him is there nothing false; if he conquers you, you will have forfeited your

faith; that is the penance you will have to pay the Victor!"

    Ludicrous as it may perhaps sound to you, dear friend, at this point I

heard for the first time from outside that which I have heard from within and

have known for ever so long, namely, that I am the most terrible opponent of

Christianity, and have discovered a mode of attack of which even Voltaire

had not an inkling.[85] But what does all this "thank God!" matter to you?

  What I envy in Epicurus are the disciples in his garden, aye, in such

circumstances one could certainly forget noble Greece and more certainly

still  ignoble  Germany!  And  hence  my  rage  since  I  have  grasped  in  the

broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good

name, my character and my aims) suffice to take from me the trust of, and

therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils. You will believe me when I say

that I have not written a single line "for the sake of fame"; but I fancied that

my writings might prove a good bait. For, after all, the impulse to teach is

strong in me. And to this extent I require fame, so that I may get disciples-

particularly  in  view  of  the  fact  that,  to  judge  from  recent  experiences,  a

University post is impossible.

  Yours,

  Nietzsche To His Sister - August, 1883

    Sils-Maria, End of August, 1883.

  MY DEAR SISTER:    To-day, just as it was three days ago, the weather is perfectly bright and

clear and I can survey with cheerfulness and confidence that which I have

and have not achieved up to the present, and that which I still expect from

myself. You do not know this, and that is why I cannot take it amiss that you

should wish to see me on other ground, more secure and more protected.

Your letter to made me think a good deal, and the chance remark you made

about my condition in Bale having certainly been the best hitherto, made me

think even more. I, on the other hand, judge the matter as follows: the whole

meaning of the terrible physical suffering to which I was exposed lies in the

fact that, thanks to it alone, I was torn away from an estimate of my life-task

which was not only false but a hundred times too low. And as by nature I

belong to the modest among men, some violent means were necessary in

order to recall me to myself. Even the teachers I had as a young man are

probably, in relation to what I have to do, only minor and transitory forces.

The fact that I stood above them and contemplated their ideals over their

heads-above  all  these  Schopenhauers  and  Wagners-this  is  what  prevented

them from being quite indispensable to me, and now I could not do myself a

greater  injustice  than  to  judge  myself  according  to  these  contemporaries

whom I have in every sense overcome. Every word in my Zarathustra is

simply so much triumphant scorn and more than scorn, flung at the ideals of

this period, and behind almost every word there stands a personal experience,

an act of self-overcoming of the highest order. It is absolutely necessary that I

should be misunderstood; nay, I would go even further and say that I must

succeed in being understood in the worst possible way and despised. The fact

that those "nearest to me" should be the first to do this was what I understood

last summer and the following autumn, and by that alone I became filled with

the glorious consciousness of being on the right road. This feeling may be

read everywhere in Zarathustra. The dreadful winter, together with my bad

health, made me forget it, and sapped my courage, just as the things which

have happened to me during the last few weeks have brought me into the

greatest danger-the danger of departing from my appointed path. The moment

I  am  now  forced  to  say:  "I  cannot  endure  loneliness  any  longer,"  I  am

conscious of having fallen to untold depths in my own estimation-of having

deserted the highest that is in me.

  What do these Rees and Lous matter! How can I be their enemy? And

even if they have harmed me, I have surely derived enough profit from them,

if  only  from  the  fact  that  they  are  people  of  such  a  different  order  frommyself; in this I find complete compensation-aye, even a reason for feeling

grateful to them both. They both seemed to be original people and not copies,

and that is why I suffered their company, however distasteful they were to

me.  As  regards  "friendship"-until  now  I  have  practised  the  most  severe

abstinence (Schmeitzner declares that I have no friends, that I "have been left

absolutely in the lurch for ten years!") In so far as the general trend of my

nature is concerned, I have no comrades; nobody has any idea when I most

need comfort, encouragement, or a shake of the hand. An extreme instance of

this occurred last year, after my stay at Tantenburg and Leipzig. And if ever I

complain the whole world thinks it is entitled to exercise its modicum of

power over me as a sufferer-they call it consolation, pity, good advice, etc.

  But men like myself have always had to put up with the same sort of

thing; my purely personal trouble is my declining health, which makes itself

felt by a depreciation of my feeling of power and by a lack of confidence in

myself. And as, under this European sky, I suffer and am low-spirited for at

least eight months in the year, it is a stroke of exceptional luck that I am able

to bear it any longer. What I mean by luck in this connection is no more than

the absence of such strokes of ill fortune as that of last year-that is to say, that

no other stones should enter the works of my watch. For I might perish from

the  effects  of  small  stones,  because  at  present  the  watch  is  most  highly

complicated  and  the  responsibility  for  all  the  most  exalted  questions  of

knowledge  rests  on  my  shoulders.  In  summa,  to  draw  some  practical

conclusions  from  these  generalities,  remember,  my  dear  sister,  never  to

remind me either by word of mouth or in writing, of those matters that would

deprive  me  of  my  self-confidence,  aye,  almost  of  the  whole  point  of  my

existence  hitherto.  If  these  things  affect  and  have  affected  me  so  much,

ascribe it to my health! Cultivate forgetfulness and anything else new and

quite different from these things, in order that I may learn to laugh at the loss

of such friends! And remember that his contemporaries can never be just to a

man like myself, and that every compromise for the sake of "a good name" is

unworthy of me.

  Written under a bright clear sky, with a clear mind, a good digestion, and

the time-early morning.

  Your Brother.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - September, 1883

    Sils-Maria, Monday, September 3, 1883.

  MY DEAR FRIEND:  Once again my stay in the Engadine has come to an end, and I shall leave

here on Wednesday-for Germany, where there is much for me to do and to

settle. If you should wish to write to me, direct the letter to Naumburg; there

in  my  most  natural  frame  of  mind  I  will  rest  awhile  and  recuperate,  in

addition  to  eating  a  good  deal  of  fine  fruit.  What  I  shall  miss  there,  as

everywhere, is your music. I believe that just as my work makes a stronger

and  more  discomfiting  impression  upon  you  than  upon  anyone  else,  so

everything that proceeds from you has a more soothing effect upon me than

upon anyone else. This is indeed a fine relationship between us! May be it is

the sort of relationship that might exist between a writer of comedy and a

writer of tragedy (I remember telling you that Wagner saw in me a writer of

tragedy in disguise); it is certainly true that on the whole I come out of it in a

more Epicurean fashion than you do; for thus is the "law of things." The

writer of comedy is of the higher species, and must do more good than the

other, whether he wants to or not.

  This Engadine is the birthplace of my Zarathustra. Only a moment ago I

found the first draft of the thoughts incorporated in it. And one of the notes

reads as follows: "The beginning of August 1881 in Sils-Maria, 6,000 feet

above  the  sea,  and  at  a  much  higher  altitude  above  all  human  affairs."  I

wonder how the pain and confusion of my spirit affected the tone of the first

two parts! (for the thoughts and the aims were already fixed). How strange

dear old friend! Quite seriously, I believe, that Zarathustra turned out to be

more cheerful and happier than he would otherwise have been. I could prove

this almost "documentarily."

  On the other hand: I should not have suffered, nor should I suffer still a

quarter as much as I have done, if during the last two years I had not fifty

times over applied the themes of my hermit theories to practical life, and

owing to the evil-yea! terrible results of this exercise-driven myself to doubts

concerning my very self. To this extent did Zarathustra wax cheerful at my

expense, and at his expense did I grow overcast with gloom.

  By-the-bye, I must inform you, not without regret, that now with the third

part, poor Zarathustra is really going to be plunged in gloom-so much so, that

Schopenhauer and Leopardi will seem like children and beginners beside his

"pessimism." But the plan of the work requires it. In order, however, to be

able  to  write  this  part,  what  I  shall  need,  in  the  first  place,  is  profound

Heavenly cheerfulness for I shall succeed with the pathos of the highest kind,

only if I treat it as play. (In the end everything becomes bright.)  Perhaps I shall work at something theoretical meanwhile; my notes for

this work bear the heading:

  the innocence of becoming

  A finger-post pointing to the deliverance from Morality. . . .

  Remain ever true to your friend,

    NIETZSCHE.

  Nietzsche To His Sister - November, 1883

    Genoa, November, 1883.

  MY DEAR LAMA:

  The thought of being reckoned among the authors! that belongs to the

things that make me tremble with disgust. But, my dear sister, just study

"Dawn  of  Day"  and  "Joyful  Wisdom"  books  whose  contents  and  whose

future are the richest on earth! In your last letters there was a good deal about

"egoistic" and "unegoistic," that ought no longer to be written by my sister. I

draw above all a sharp line be tween strong and weak men-those who are

destined to rulership, and those who are destined to service, obedience, and

devotion. That which turns my stomach in this age is the untold amount of

weakness, unmanliness, impersonality, changeableness, and good-nature-in

short weakness in the matter of "self"-seeking, which would fain masquerade

as "virtue." That which has given me pleasure up to the present has been the

sight of men with a long will-who can hold their peace for years and who do

not  simply  on  that  account  deck  themselves  out  with  pompous  moral

phraseology,  and  parade  as  "heroes"  or  "noblemen,"  but  who  are  honest

enough to believe in nothing but themselves and their will, in order to stamp

it upon mankind for all time.

  Excuse  me.  That  which  drew  me  to  Richard  Wagner  was  this;

Schopenhauer, too, had the same feeling all his life. . . .

  I know perhaps better than anyone else how to recognize an order of rank

even among strong men, according to their virtue, and on the same principle

there are certainly hundreds of sorts of very decent and lovable people among

the weak-in keeping with the virtues peculiar to the weak. There are some

strong  "selves"  whose  selfishness  one  might  call  divine  (for  instance

Zarathustra's)  but  any  kind  of  strength  is  in  itself  alone  a  refreshing  and

blessed spectacle. Read Shakespeare! He is full of such strong men, raw,

hard, and mighty men of granite. Our age is so poor in these men and even in

strong men who have enough brains for my thoughts!

  Do not form too low an estimate of the disappointment and loss I havesuffered this year. You cannot think how lonely and "out of it" I always feel

when I am in the midst of all the kindly Tartufferie of those people whom

you call "good," and how intensely I yearn at times for a man who is honest

and who can talk even if he were a monster [. . . . . ] , but of course I should

prefer discourse with demi-gods.

  But once again, forgive me! I am writing you all this out of the heartiest

depths of my heart, and know very well how very good your intentions are

where I am concerned. Oh, this infernal solitude!

  F. N.

  P. S.-Stein is still too young for me. I should spoil him. I almost spoilt

Gast-I have to be most awfully careful of my Ps and Qs with him.

  To Rohde - February, 1884

  Nice, February 22, 1884.

  MY DEAR OLD FRIEND:

  I know not how it was, but when I read your last letter and especially

when I saw the charming photograph of your child, I felt as if you were

shaking me by the hand gazing at me sadly the while-sadly, as if you meant

to say: "How is it possible that we should have so little in common now, and

that we should be living as if in different worlds! And there was a time when-

"

  The same thing, dear friend, has happened in regard to all the people I

love; everything is over, it all belongs to the past, it is all merely merciful

indulgence now. We see each other still, we talk in order to avoid being

silent-we still write each other letters in order to avoid being silent. Truth,

however glances from their eyes, and these tell me (I hear it well enough):

"Friend Nietzsche, you are now quite alone!"

  That's what I have lived and fought for!

    Meanwhile I continue along my road; as a matter of fact it is a journey, a

sea-journey-and  it  is  not  in  vain  that  I  sojourned  for  so  many  years  in

Columbus' town.

  My Zarathustra has come to an end in its three acts. You have the first,

and the two others I hope to be able to send you within a month or six weeks.

There is a sort of abyss of the future, something uncanny, particularly in his

supreme happiness. Everything in it is my own, independent of all example,

parallel, or predecessor. He who has once lived in its atmosphere returns to

this world with another face.

  But of this one should not speak. From you, however, as a homo literatusI shall not withold a confession: I have the idea that with this Zarathustra I

have brought the German language to its acme of perfection. After Luther

and Goethe there still remained a third step to be taken-just ask yourself, dear

old comrade, whether power, suppleness, and euphony have ever before been

united in this way in our language. Read Goethe after having read a page of

my book and you will find that that "undulating quality," which Goethe as a

draughtsman possessed, was not unknown even to the word-painter. It is in

my more severe and more manly line that I excel him, without, however,

descending to the coarse mob with Luther. My style is a dance, a play of all

kinds of symmetries, and a vaulting and mocking of these symmetries. And

this even extends to the choice of vowels.

  Forgive me! I shall take care not to make this confession to anyone else,

but once, I believe, you alone expressed the pleasure my style had given you.

Moreover  I  have  remained  a  poet  to  the  utmost  limits  of  this  concept,

although I have already tyrannized over myself thoroughly with the reverse

of everything that could be called poetry.

  Ah, dear friend, what an absurdly silent life I lead! So much alone, so

much alone! So "childless"!

  Remain fond of me; I am truly fond of you.

  Yours,

  F. N.

  Nietzsche To Peter Gast - December, 1885

    [December 10, 1885]

  Nice (France) Rue St. Frangoisde Paule, II, 26.

  DEAR FRIEND:

  You  may  perhaps  receive  a  letter  that  I  addressed  to  you  in  Vienna

(provided that you left, or intended to leave, your Annaberg address with the

poste restante of the principal post office there.) After all, I marvel at the sort

of "parallelism" that has characterized our experiences and zig-zag journeys

this year-so much indeed that I almost rejoice at the thought, for, as the result

of it all, I feel imbued with a general feeling of peace and gentle indifference,

which I hope may be your reward also. At present there is not a soul in

Germany  who  has  an  inkling  of  what  I  want,  or  of  the  fact  that  I  want

anything at all, or even that I have already attained a not insignificant portion

thereof. There is not a soul who at heart is either well pleased, or anxious, or

distressed, or anything whatsoever, about the "things" that I hold dear. But,

after all, perhaps to be aware of this alone is an invaluable piece of insight,and with it one has approached quite near to Epicurus's garden, and above all

to oneself-after it, one jumps with a mighty spring back to oneself. Let us

continue  to  do  that  which  we  enjoy  doing-that  which  gives  us  a  clean

conscience  about  ourselves;  for  the  rest,  silence  or  gloria,  "as  God  may

please."

  Something must be discovered and thought out by means of which the

next  few  years  may  be  made  secure  and  no  longer  full  of  dangerous

accidents. In saying this it is you I have in mind, dear friend. It is quite proper

that you should first try Carlsruhe. Whether you succeed there or not, you

ought immediately afterwards again to look about you for a quiet haunt. I

have  come  to  the  sad  though  obvious  conclusion  that  the  depression  that

would overtake you in the event of another failure ought to drive you to

Venice as the only spot on earth that suits you. Although I allowed myself to

recommend  Nice  to  you  in  my  last  letter,  I  was  quite  well  aware  of  the

principal obstacle in the way of your coming, and of your reasons for fearing

that you would not be enough of a hermit here. Bear in mind, however, that

the four months that I probably spend here every year, only make up a third

of the year, and, secondly, that for me these four months are precisely my

working  period,  during  which  I  keep  out  of  the  way  of  "mankind,"  and

perhaps of friends as well; above all, consider that the friend you would find

here is one with whom one can conclude a strict arrangement, and who takes

an almost personal interest in all the conditions, whether of your work or

your life. Besides there is this to be said for Nice: it is a place in which one

can live the whole year round-you will find it much more exhilarating than

Venice in summer, thanks to the cool sea-breezes at night. Nice is, moreover,

from an aesthetic point of view, the reverse of Venice, as southern cities go; it

seems to me to be worth your while to try it, just to see what the Muses, or

the mistral, or the luminous heavens would have to tell you here. Thirdly, you

can live more cheaply here than at any other place on the Riviera; Nice is a

large open-hearted place, with attractions for all. Prices are naturally higher

during the winter; they tell me that during the summer they fall 50 per cent.

Nevertheless, even in the winter, I could recommend you some respectable

restaurants, where your food would be such as you are used to having in

Venice, but if anything cheaper and better. It is a heavenly blessing that you

have not got the luxurious tastes of the majority of artists, and that your most

estimable life also reveals the virtues of simplicity and thriftiness. Later on,

of course, you will be a rich man, but the thing which is all important now isthat you should be spared the care of this "later on." Your art requires that

you should be free from worry; is that not so, my dear friend?

  Yours,

  N.

  Nice, After Christmas, 1885.

  MY DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER:

  The  weather  is  perfect,  and  so  your  "famous  animal"[86]  must  also

assume a pleasant countenance, although it has had many a sad day and night.

Christmas,  however,  was  a  regular  day  of  rejoicing  for  me.  At  midday  I

received your kind presents, and lost no time in putting the chain round my

neck; while the nice little calendar found its way into my waistcoat pocket.

But the money must certainly have slipped out, if there really were money in

the letter (and mother says there was.) Forgive your blind animal for this! I

unpacked my treasure in the street, and something may certainly have fallen

out, for I fumbled very eagerly for the letter. Let us hope that some poor old

woman was not far off, and that she thus found her "Christimas stocking"

filled in the street. I then drove to my peninsula St. Jean, ran a long way

along the coast, and at last sat down among some young soldiers who were

playing  skittles.  Fresh  roses  and  geraniums  adorned  the  hedges  and

everything was green and warm; nothing northern! Then your famous animal

drank  three  quite  large  glasses  of  a  sweet  local  wine,  and  was  just  the

slightest bit top-heavy; at least, not long afterwards, when the breakers drew

near to me, I said to them as one says to a bevy of farmyard fowls, "Shsh!

Shsh!  Shsh!"  Then  I  drove  back  to  Nice,  and  regaled  myself  in  princely

fashion at dinner in my pension. A large Christmas tree was also lighted up.

Just  think,  I  have  discovered  a  boulanger  de  luxe  who  understands  what

cheesecakes are. He said that the King of W�rtemberg had ordered one of

these cakes for his birthday. It was the word "princely" that brought this to

my mind.

  Ever your loving,

  F.

  Nice, February, 1886.

  MY DEAR OLD LAMA:

  Your kind and cheerful proposition has just reached me. If by any chance

it could serve the purpose of giving your husband a good opinion of theincorrigible European and anti-antisemite, your utterly heterodox brother and

"Jack-in-the-Corner"-Fritz (although Dr. Forster had certainly other things to

think  of  without  troubling  about  me),  I  would  willingly  tread  in  Fraulein

Alwinchen Forster's footsteps, and beseech you to convert me into a South

American  landowner  on  the  same  lines  and  conditions.  I  must,  however,

stipulate most emphatically that the plot of land be called not Frederickland

or Frederickwood (for, to begin with, I do not wish to die yet and be buried

there) but, in memory of the name I have given you-Lamaland.

  Joking apart, I would send you everything I possess if it would help to get

you  back  here  soon.  Generally  speaking,  everybody  who  knows  you  and

loves you is of opinion that it would have been a thousand times better for

you to have been spared this experiment. Even if that country were found to

be  ever  so  well  suited  to  German  colonization,  no  one  would  admit  that

precisely you two ought to be the colonizers. The fact that you should be

seems  to  be  the  result  of  an  absolutely  arbitrary  choice-excuse  the

expression!-it  is  moreover  dangerous,  particularly  for  a  lama  who  is

accustomed to a gentle culture and prospers and capers about best in such an

environment. The whole of this heating up of feelings, constituting as it does

the cause of the whole affair, is too tropical and, in my opinion, not even

wholesome for a Lama (or to speak more accurately, for the whole of our real

family type, whose art lies in the reconciliation of contrasts.) One keeps one's

beauty and youth longer when one neither hates nor feels mistrustful. After

all, I cannot help thinking that your nature would prove itself more useful in a

truly German cause, here in Europe, than over there particularly as the wife

of  Dr.  Forster,  who,  as  I  thought  once  more  on  reading  his  Essay  on

Education, would really find his natural mission as a Director of Education at

a place like Schnepfenthal[87]-and not (forgive your brother for saying so) as

an agitator in that anti-Semitic movement which is three-quarters rotten. The

things most urgently needed in Germany at present are precisely independent

Educational  Institutions,  which  would  actively  compete  with  the  slave-

drilling education of the State. The confidence that Dr. Forster enjoys vis-a-

vis the nobility of northern Germany, would seem to be a sufficient guarantee

that a sort of Schnepfenthal or Hofwyl (do you remember?-the place where

Vischer  was  educated),  would  succeed  under  his  direction.  But  right  out

there, among peasants, in close proximity to Germans, who have become

impossible, and are probably embittered and poisoned at heart-enough, what

a  wide  field  this  provides  for  worry  and  anxiety!  The  big  stupid  ocean
