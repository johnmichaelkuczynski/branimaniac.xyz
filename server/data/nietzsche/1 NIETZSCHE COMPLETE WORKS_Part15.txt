(which is logic and its application to space and time), that concept is reduced

to the formulas of mathematics--with which, as one must emphasize again

and again, nothing is ever comprehended, but rather designated and distorted.

  555 (1885-1886)

  Against the scientific prejudice.--The biggest fable of all is the fable of

knowledge.  One  would  like  to  know  what  things-in-themselves  are;  but

behold, there are no things-in-themselves! But even supposing there were an

in-itself,  an  unconditioned  thing,  it  would  for  that  very  reason  be

unknowable! Something unconditioned cannot be known; otherwise it would

not be unconditioned! Coming to know, however, is always "placing oneself

in  a  conditional  relation  to  something"  one  who  seeks  to  know  the

unconditioned  desires  that  it  should  not  concern  him,  and  that  this  same

something should be of no concern to anyone. This involves a contradiction,

first, between wanting to know and the desire that it not concern us (but why

know at all, then?) and, secondly, because something that is of no concern to

anyone IS not at all, and thus cannot be known at all.--

  Coming  to  know  means  "to  place  oneself  in  a  conditional  relation  to

something";  to  feel  oneself  conditioned  by  something  and  oneself  to

condition  it--it  is  therefore  under  all  circumstances  establishing,  denoting,

and making-conscious of conditions (not forthcoming entities, things, what is

"in-itself").

  556 (1885-1886)

  A "thing-in-itself" just as perverse as a "sense-in-itself," a "meaning-in-

itself."  There  are  no  "facts-in-themselves,"  for  a  sense  must  always  be

projected into them before there can be "facts."

  The question "what is that?" is an imposition of meaning from some other

viewpoint. "Essence," the "essential nature," is something perspective and

already presupposes a multiplicity. At the bottom of it there always lies "what

is that for me?" (for us, for all that lives, etc.)

  A thing would be defined once all creatures had asked "what is that?" and

had answered their question. Supposing one single creature, with its own

relationships  and  perspectives  for  all  things,  were  missing,  then  the  thing

would not yet be "defined".

  In short: the essence of a thing is only an opinion about the "thing." Or

rather: "it is considered" as the real "it is," the sole "this is."

  One may not ask: "who then interprets?" for the interpretation itself is a

form of the will to power, it exists (but not as a "being,' but as a process, abecoming) as an affect.

  The origin of "things" is wholly the work of that which imagines, thinks,

wills, feels. The concept "thing" itself just as much as all its qualities.--Even

"the subject" is such a created entity, a "thing" like all others: a simplification

with the object of defining the force which posits, invents, thinks, as distinct

from all individual positing, inventing, thinking as such. Thus a capacity as

distinct  from  all  that  is  individual--fundamentally,  action  collectively

considered with respect to all anticipated actions (action and the probability

of similar actions).

  557 (1885-1886)

  The properties of a thing are effects on other "things": if one removes

other "things," then a thing has no properties, i.e., there is no thing without

other things, i.e., there is no "thing-in-itself."

  558 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  The "thing-in-itself" nonsensical. If I remove all the relationships, all the

"properties," all the "activities" of a thing, the thing does not remain over;

because thingness has only been invented by us owing to the requirements of

logic, thus with the aim of defining, communication (to bind together the

multiplicity of relationships, properties, activities).

  559 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  "Things that have a constitution in themselves"--a dogm idea with which

one must break absolutely.

  560 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  That  things  possess  a  constitution  in  themselves  quite  apart  from

interpretation and subjectivity, is a quite idle hypothesis: it presupposes that

interpretation and subjectivity are not essential, that a thing freed from all

relationships would still be a thing.

    Conversely, the apparent objective character of things: could it not be

merely a difference of degree within the subjective?--that perhaps that which

changes slowly presents itself to us as "objectively" enduring, being, "in-

itself"--that the objective is only a false concept of a genus and an antithesis

within the subjective?

  561 (1885-1886)

  Suppose all unity were unity only as an organization? But the "thing" in

which we believe was only invented as a foundation for the various attributes.

If the thing "effects," that means: we conceive all the other properties which

are present and momentarily latent, as the cause of the emergence of onesingle property; i.e., we take the sum of its properties--"x"--as cause of the

property "x": which is utterly stupid and mad!

  All unity is unity only as organization and co-operation--just as a human

community is a unity--as opposed to an atomistic anarchy, as a pattern of

domination that signifies a unity but is not a unity.

  562 (1883-1888)

  "In the development of thought a point had to be reached at which one

realized that what one called the properties of things were sensations of the

feeling subject: at this point the properties ceased to belong to the thing." The

"thing-in-itself" remained. The distinction between the thing-in-itself and the

thing-for-us is based on the older, naive form of perception which granted

energy to things; but analysis revealed that even force was only projected into

them, and likewise--substance. "The thing affects a subject"? Root of the idea

of substance in language, not in beings outside us! The thing-in-itself is no

problem at all!

    Beings will have to be thought of as sensations that are no longer based

on something devoid of sensation.

  In motion, no new content is given to sensation. That which IS, cannot

contain motion: therefore it is a form of being.

  N.B. The explanation of an event can be sought firstly: through mental

images of the event that precede it (aims);

  secondly:  through  mental  images  that  succeed  it  (the  mathematical-

physical explanation).

  One should not confuse the two. Thus: the physical explanation, which is

a symbolization of the world by means of sensation and thought, can in itself

never account for the origin of sensation and thought; rather physics must

construe the world of feeling consistently as lacking feeling and aim--right up

to the highest human being. And teleology is only a history of purposes and

never physical!

  563 (1886-1887)

  Our "knowing" limits itself to establishing quantities; but we cannot help

feeling these differences in quantity as qualities. Quality is a perspective truth

for us; not an "in-itself."

  Our  senses  have  a  definite  quantum  as  a  mean  within  which  they

function; i.e., we sense bigness and smallness in relation to the conditions of

our  existence.  If  we  sharpened  or  blunted  our  senses  tenfold,  we  should

perish;  i.e.,  with  regard  to  making  possible  our  existence  we  sense  evenrelations between magnitudes as qualities.

  564 (1885-1886)

  Might all quantities not be signs of qualities? A greater power implies a

different  consciousness,  feeling,  desiring,  a  different  perspective;  growth

itself is a desire to be more; the desire for an increase in quantum grows from

a  quale;  in  a  purely  quantitative  world  everything  would  be  dead,  stiff,

motionless.-- The reduction of all qualities to quantities is nonsense: what

appears is that the one accompanies the other, an analogy--

  565 (Fall 1886)

    Qualities are insurmountable barriers for us; we cannot help feeling that

mere  quantitative  differences  are  something  fundamentally  distinct  from

quantity, namely that they are qualities which can no longer be reduced to

one  another.  But  everything  for  which  the  word  "knowledge"  makes  any

sense refers to the domain of reckoning. weighing, measuring, to the domain

of quantity; while, on the other hand, all our sensations of value (i.e., simply

our sensations) adhere precisely to qualities, i.e., to our perspective "truths"

which belong to us alone and can by no means be "known"! It is obvious that

every creature different from us senses different qualities and consequently

lives  in  a  different  world  from  that  in  which  we  live.  Qualities  are  an

idiosyncrasy peculiar to man; to demand that our human interpretations and

values  should  be  universal  and  perhaps  constitutive  values  is  one  of  the

hereditary madnesses of human pride.

  566 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  The "real world," however one has hitherto conceived it, it has always

been the apparent world once again.

  567 (March-June 1888)

  The apparent world, i.e., a world viewed according to values; ordered,

selected according to values, i.e., in this case according to the viewpoint of

utility in regard to the preservation and enhancement of the power of a certain

species of animal.

  The perspective therefore decides the character of the "appearance"! As if

a world would still remain over after one deducted the perspective! By doing

that one would deduct relativity!

  Every center of force adopts a perspective toward the entire remainder,

i.e., its own particular valuation, mode of action, and mode of resistance. The

"apparent world," therefore, is reduced to a specific mode of action on the

world, emanating from a center.  Now there is no other mode of action whatever; and the "world" is only a

word  for  the  totality  of  these  actions.  Reality  consists  precisely  in  this

particular action and reaction of every individual part toward the whole--

  No shadow of a right remains to speak here of appearance--

  The specific mode of reacting is the only mode of reacting; we do not

know how many and what kinds of other modes there are.

  But there is no "other," no "true," no essential being--for this would be the

expression of a world without action and reaction--

  The antithesis of the apparent world and the true world reduced to the

antithesis "world" and "nothing."--

  568 (March-June 1888)

  Critique of the concept "true and apparent world."-- Of these, the first is a

mere fiction, constructed of fictitious entities.

    "Appearance" itself belongs to reality: it is a form of its being; i.e., in a

world where there is no being, a certain calculable world of identical cases

must first be created through appearance: a tempo at which observation and

comparison are possible, etc.

    Appearance is an arranged and simplified world, at which our practical

instincts have been at work; it is perfectly true for us; that is to say, we live,

we are able to live in it: proof of its truth for us--

  The world, apart from our condition of living in it, the world that we have

not reduced to our being, our logic and psychological prejudices, does not

exist as a world "in-itself"; it is essentially a world of relationships; under

certain  conditions  it  has  a  differing  aspect  from  every  point;  its  being  is

essentially different from every point; it presses upon every point, every point

resists it--and the sum of these is in every case quite incongruent.

  The  measure  of  power  determines  what  being  possesses  the  other

measure of power; in what form, force, constraint it acts or resists.

  Our particular case is interesting enough: we have produced a conception

in order to be able to live in a world, in order to perceive just enough to

endure it--

  569 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Our  psychological  perspective  is  determined  by  the  following:  1.  that

communication  is  necessary,  and  that  for  there  to  be  communication

something has to be firm, simplified, capable of precision (above all in the

[so-called] identical case). For it to be communicable, however, it must be

experienced as adapted, as "recognizable." The material of the senses adaptedby  the  understanding,  reduced  to  rough  outlines,  made  similar,  subsumed

under related matters. Thus the fuzziness and chaos of sense impressions are,

as it were, logicized;

  2. the world of "phenomena" is the adapted world which we feel to be

real.  The  "reality"  lies  in  the  continual  recurrence  of  identical,  familiar,

related things in their logicized character, in the belief that here we are able to

reckon and calculate;

  3. the antithesis of this phenomenal world is not "the true world," but the

formless  unformulable  world  of  the  chaos  of  sensations--another  kind  of

phenomenal world, a kind "unknowable" for us;

  4. questions, what things "in-themselves" may be like, apart from our

sense receptivity and the activity of our understanding, must be rebutted with

the question: how could we know that things exist? "Thingness" was first

created by us. The question is whether there could not be many other ways of

creating  such  an  apparent  world--and  whether  this  creating,  logicizing,

adapting, falsifying is not itself the best-guaranteed reality; in short, whether

that which "posits things" is not the sole reality; and whether the "effect of

the external world upon us" is not also only the result of such active subjects-

-The other "entities" act upon us; our adapted apparent world is an adaptation

and overpowering of their actions; a kind of defensive measure. The subject

alone is demonstrable; hypothesis that only subjects exist--that "object" is

only a kind of effect produced by a subject upon a subject a modus of the

subject. 10. Metaphysical Need

  570 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  If one is a philosopher as men have always been philosophers, one cannot

see what has been and becomes--one sees only what is. But since nothing is,

all that was left to the philosopher as his "world" was the imaginary.

  571 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

  To assert the existence as a whole of things of which we know nothing

whatever, precisely because there is an advantage in not being able to know

anything  of  them,  was  a  piece  of  naivete  of  Kant,  resulting  from  needs,

mainly moral-metaphysical.

  572 (1883-1888)

  An artist cannot endure reality, he looks away from it, back: he seriously

believes that the value of a thing resides in that shadowy residue one derives

from  colors,  form,  sound,  ideas,  he  believes  that  the  more  subtilized,

attenuated, transient a thing or a man is, the more valuable he becomes; theless real, the more valuable. This is Platonism, which, however, involved yet

another bold reversal: Plato measured the degree of reality by the degree of

value and said: The more "Idea", the more being. He reversed the concept

"reality" and said: "What you take for real is an error, and the nearer we

approach the 'Idea', the nearer we approach 'truth'. "--Is this understood? It

was  the  greatest  of  rebaptisms;  and  because  it  has  been  adopted  by

Christianity we do not recognize how astonishing it is. Fundamentally, Plato,

as the artist he was, preferred appearance to being! lie and invention to truth!

the unreal to the actual! But he was so convinced of the value of appearance

that he gave it the attributes "being","causality" and "goodness", and "truth",

in short everything men value.

  The concept of value itself considered as a cause: first insight. The ideal

granted all honorific attributes: second insight.

  573 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

  The  idea  of  the  "true  world"  or  of  "God"  as  absolutely  immaterial,

spiritual,  good,  is  an  emergency  measure  necessary  while  the  opposite

instincts are still all-powerful--

  The degree of moderation and humanity attained is exactly reflected in

the humanization of the gods: the Greeks of the strongest epoch, who were

not afraid of themselves but rejoiced in themselves, brought their gods close

to all their own affects--.

  The spiritualization of the idea of God is therefore far from being a sign

of progress: one is heartily conscious of this when considering Goethe--in his

case,  the  vaporization  of  God  into  virtue  and  spirit  is  felt  as  being  on  a

coarser level--

  574 (1883-1888)

    Senselessness of all metaphysics as the derivation of the conditioned from

the unconditioned.

  It  is  in  the  nature  of  thinking  that  it  thinks  of  and  invents  the

unconditioned  as  an  adjunct  to  the  conditioned;  just  as  it  thought  of  and

invented  the  "ego"  as  an  adjunct  to  the  multiplicity  of  its  processes;  it

measures  the  world  according  to  magnitudes  posited  by  itself--such

fundamental fictions as "the unconditional","ends and

means'',"things","substances", logical laws, numbers and forms.

  There would be nothing that could be called knowledge if thought did not

first re-form the world in this way into "things", into what is self-identical.

Only because there is thought is there untruth.  Thought cannot be derived, any more than sensations can be; but that

does not mean that its primordiality or "being-in-itself" has been proved! all

that is established is that we cannot get beyond it, because we have nothing

but thought and sensation.

  575 (1885-1886)

    "Knowledge" is a referring back: in its essence a regressus in infinitum.

That which comes to a standstill (at a supposed causa prima, at something

unconditioned, etc.) is laziness, weariness

  576 (1883-1888)

    Psychology of metaphysics: the influence of timidity.

  That which has been feared the most, the cause of the most powerful

suffering (lust to rule, sex, etc.), has been treated by men with the greatest

amount of hostility and eliminated from the "true" world. Thus they have

eliminated the affects one by one --posited God as the antithesis of evil, that

is,  placed  reality  in  the  negation  of  the  desires  and  affects  (i.e.,  in

nothingness).

  In  the  same  way,  they  have  hated  the  irrational,  the  arbitrary,  the

accidental  (as  the  causes  of  immeasurable  physical  suffering).  As  a

consequence, they negated this element in being-in-itself and conceived it as

absolute "rationality" and "purposiveness."

  In the same way, they have feared change, transitoriness: this expresses a

straitened soul, full of mistrust and evil experiences (the case of Spinoza: an

opposite kind of man would account change a stimulus).

  A creature overloaded and playing with force would call precisely the

affects, irrationality, and change good in a eudaemonistic sense, together with

their consequences: danger, contrast, perishing, etc.

  577 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Against  the  value  of  that  which  remains  eternally  the  same  (vice

Spinoza's  naivete;  Descartes'  also),  the  values  of  the  briefest  and  most

transient, the seductive flash of gold on the belly of the serpent vita--

  578 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Moral  values  even  in  theory  of  knowledge:  trust  in  reason--why  not

mistrust?  the  "true  world"  is  supposed  to  be  the  good  world--why?

appearance, change, contradiction, struggle devalued as immoral; desire for a

world in which these things are missing; the transcendental world invented,

in order that a place remains for "moral freedom" (in Kant); dialectic a way to

virtue (in Plato and Socrates: evidently because Sophistry counted as the wayto immorality); time and space ideal: consequently "unity" in the essence of

things; consequently no "sin," no evil, no imperfection --a justification of

God; Epicurus denied the possibility of knowledge, in order to retain moral

(or  hedonistic)  values  as  the  highest  values.  Augustine,  later  Pascal

("corrupted  reason"),  did  the  same  for  the  benefit  of  Christian  values;

Descartes' contempt for everything that changes; also that of Spinoza

  579 (1883-1888)

    Psychology of metaphysics.--This world is apparent: consequently there

is  a  true  world;--this  world  is  conditional:  consequently  there  is  an

unconditioned world;--this world is full of contradiction: consequently there

is  a  world  free  of  contradiction;--  this  world  is  a  world  of  becoming:

consequently there is a world of being:--all false conclusions (blind trust in

reason:  if  A  exists,  then  the  opposite  concept  B  must  also  exist).  It  is

suffering that inspires these conclusions: fundamentally they are desires that

such  a  world  should  exist;  in  the  same  way,  to  imagine  another,  more

valuable world is an expression of hatred for a world that makes one suffer:

the ressentiment of metaphysicians against actuality is here creative.

    Second series of questions: for what is there suffering?--and from this a

conclusion  is  derived  concerning  the  relation  of  the  true  world  to  our

apparent,  changing,  suffering,  contradictory  world:  (1)  Suffering  as  a

consequence of error: how is error possible? (2) Suffering as a consequence

of guilt: how is guilt possible? (--experiences derived from nature or society

universalized  and  projected  to  the  sphere  of  "in-itself").  If,  however,  the

conditioned world is causally conditioned by the unconditioned world, then

freedom to err and incur guilt must also be conditioned by it: and again one

asks,  what  for?--The  world  of  appearance,  becoming,  contradiction,

suffering, is therefore willed: what for?

  The error in these conclusions: two opposite concepts are constructed--

because  one  of  them  corresponds  to  a  reality,  the  other  "must"  also

correspond to a reality. "Whence should one derive this opposite concept if

this were not so?"--Reason is thus a source of revelation concerning being-in-

itself.

  But  the  origin  of  these  antitheses  need  not  necessarily  go  back  to  a

supernatural source of reason: it is sufficient to oppose to it the real genesis

of the concepts. This derives from the practical sphere, the sphere of utility;

hence the strength of the faith it inspires (one would perish if one did not

reason according to this mode of reason; but this is no "proof" of what itasserts).

  The preoccupation with suffering on the part of metaphysicians--is quite

naive. "Eternal bliss": psychological nonsense. Brave and creative men never

consider pleasure and pain as ultimate values--they are epiphenomena: one

must desire both if one is to achieve anything--. That they see the problem of

pleasure and pain in the foreground reveals something weary and sick in

metaphysicians and religious people. Even morality is so important to them

only  because  they  see  in  it  an  essential  condition  for  the  abolition  of

suffering.

  In the same way, their preoccupation with appearance and error: cause of

suffering, superstition that happiness attends truth (confusion: happiness in

"certainty", in "faith").

  580 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  To  what  extent  the  basic  epistemological  positions  (materialism,

idealism) are consequences of evaluations: the source of the supreme feelings

of pleasure ("feelings of value") as decisive also for the problem of reality!

  --The measure of positive knowledge is quite subsidiary or a matter of

indifference: as witness the development of India.

  The Buddhistic negation of reality in general (appearance = suffering) is

perfectly consistent: undemonstrability, inaccessibility, lack of categories not

only for a "'world-in-itself," but an insight into the erroneous procedures by

means of which this whole concept is arrived at. "Absolute reality," "being-

in-itself" a contradiction. In a world of becoming, "reality" is always only a

simplification for practical ends, or a deception through the coarseness of

organs, or a variation in the tempo of becoming.

  Logical world-denial and nihilation follow from the fact that we have to

oppose  non-being  with  being  and  that  the  concept  "becoming"  is  denied.

("Something" becomes.)

  581 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Being and becoming.--"Reason", evolved on a sensualistic basis, on the

prejudices of the senses, i.e., in the belief in the truth of the judgments of the

senses.

  "Being" as universalization of the concept "life" (breathing), "having a

soul", "willing, effecting," "becoming".

  The antithesis is: "not to have a soul," "not to become," "not to will."

Therefore: "being" is not the antithesis of non-being, appearance, nor even of

the dead (for only something that can live can be dead).  The "soul," the "ego" posited as primeval fact, and introduced everywhere

where there is any becoming.

  582 (1885-1887)

    Being--we have no idea of it apart from the idea of "living."-- How can

anything dead "be"?

  583 (March-June 1888)

  ( A )

  I observe with astonishment that science has today resigned itself to the

apparent world; a real world--whatever it may be like--we certainly have no

organ for knowing it.

  At this point we may ask: by means of what organ of knowledge can we

posit even this antithesis?--

  That a world accessible to our organs is also understood to be dependent

upon  these  organs,  that  we  understand  a  world  as  being  subjectively

conditioned, is not to say that an objective world is at all possible. Who

compels us to think that subjectivity is real, essential?

  The "in-itself" is even an absurd conception; a "constitutioning-itself" is

nonsense;  we  possess  the  concept  "being,"  "thing,"  only  as  a  relational

concept--

  The worst thing is that with the old antithesis "apparent" and "true" the

correlative value judgment "lacking in value" and "absolutely valuable" has

developed.

  The apparent world is not counted as a "valuable" world; appearance is

supposed to constitute an objection to supreme value. Only a "true" world can

be valuable in itself--

    Prejudice  of  prejudices!  Firstly,  it  would  be  possible  that  the  true

constitution of things was so hostile to the presuppositions of life, so opposed

to them, that we needed appearance in order to be able to live--After all, this

is the case in so many situations; e.g., in marriage.

  Our  empirical  world  would  be  determined  by  the  instincts  of  self-

preservation even as regards the limits of its knowledge: we would regard as

true, good, valuable that which serves the preservation of the species--

  a. We possess no categories by which we can distinguish a true from an

apparent world. (There might only be an apparent world, but not our apparent

world.)

  b. Assuming the true world, it could still be a world less valuable for us;

precisely the quantum of illusion might be of a higher rank on account of itsvalue  for  our  preservation.  (Unless  appearance  as  such  were  grounds  for

condemnation?)

  c.  That  a  correlation  exists  between  degrees  of  value  and  degrees  of

reality  (so  that  the  supreme  values  also  possess  the  supreme  reality)  is  a

metaphysical postulate proceeding from the presupposition that we know the

order of rank of values; namely, that this order of rank is a moral order--Only

with this presupposition is truth necessarily part of the definition of all the

highest values.

  ( B )

  It is of cardinal importance that one should abolish the true world. It is the

great inspirer of doubt and devaluator in respect of the world we are: it has

been our most dangerous attempt yet to assassinate life.

  War on all presuppositions on the basis of which one has invented a true

world. Among these is the presupposition that moral values are the supreme

values.

  The supremacy of moral valuation would be refuted if it could be shown

to be the consequence of an immoral valuation --as a special case of actual

immorality--it would thus reduce itself to an appearance, and as appearance it

would cease to have any right as such to condemn appearance.

  ( C )

  The "will to truth" would then have to be investigated psychologically: it

is not a moral force, but a form of the will to power. This would have to be

proved by showing that it employs every immoral means: metaphysicians

above all.

  We are today faced with testing the assertion that moral values are the

supreme  values.  Method  in  investigation  is  attained  only  when  all  moral

prejudices have been overcome:--it represents a victory over morality--

  584 (March-June 1888)

  The aberration of philosophy is that, instead of seing in logic and the

categories of reason means toward the adjustment of the world for utilitarian

ends  (basically,  toward  an  expedient  falsification),  one  believed  one

possessed in them the criterion of truth and reality. The "criterion of truth"

was  in  fact  merely  the  biological  utility  of  such  a  system  of  systematic

falsification; and since a species of animals knows of nothing more important

than its own preservation, one might indeed be permitted to speak here of

"truth."  The  naivete  was  to  take  an  anthropocentric  idiosyncrasy  as  the

measure of things, as the rule for determining "real" and "unreal": in short, tomake absolute something conditioned. And behold, suddenly the world fell

apart into a "true" world and an "apparent" world: and precisely the world

that man's reason had devised for him to live and settle in was discredited.

Instead of employing the forms as a tool for making the world manageable

and calculable, the madness of philosophers divined that in these categories is

presented the concept of that world to which the one in which man lives does

not correspond--The means were misunderstood as measures of value, even

as a condemnation of their real intention--

  The  intention  was  to  deceive  oneself  in  a  useful  way;  the  means,  the

invention of formulas and signs by means of which one could reduce the

confusing multiplicity to a purposive and manageable schema.

  But alas! now a moral category was brought into play: no creature wants

to deceive itself, no creature may deceive--consequently there is only a will

to truth. What is "truth"?

  The law of contradiction provided the schema: the true world, to which

one seeks the way, cannot contradict itself, cannot change, cannot become,

has no beginning and no end.

  This  is  the  greatest  error  that  has  ever  been  committed,  the  essential

fatality of error on earth: one believed one possessed a criterion of reality in

the forms of reason--while in fact one possessed them in order to become

master of reality, in order to misunderstand reality in a shrewd manner--

  And behold: now the world became false, and precisely on account of the

properties  that  constitute  its  reality:  change,  becoming,  multiplicity,

opposition, contradiction, war. And then the entire fatality was there:

  1. How can one get free from the false, merely apparent world? (--it was

the real, the only )

  2. how can one become oneself as much as possible the antithesis of the

character  of  the  apparent  world?  (Concept  of  the  perfect  creature  as  an

antithesis to the real creature; more clearly, as the contradiction of life--)

  The whole tendency of values was toward slander of life; one created a

confusion  of  idealist  dogmatism  and  knowledge  in  general:  so  that  the

opposing party also was always attacking science

  The road to science was in this way doubly blocked: once by belief in the

"true"  world,  and  again  by  the  opponents  of  this  belief.  Natural  science,

psychology was (1) condemned with regard to its objects, (2) deprived of its

innocence--

  In the actual world, in which everything is bound to and conditioned byeverything else, to condemn and think away anything means to condemn and

think away everything. The expression "that should not be," "that should not

have been," is farcical-- If one thinks out the consequences, one would ruin

the source of life if one wanted to abolish whatever was in some respect

harmful or destructive. Physiology teaches us better!

  --We see how morality (a) poisons the entire conception of the world, (b)

cuts off the road to knowledge, to science, (c) disintegrates and undermines

all actual instincts (in that it teaches that their roots are immoral).

  We see at work before us a dreadful tool of decadence that props itself up

by the holiest names and attitudes.

  585 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

  Tremendous  self-examination:  becoming  conscious  of  oneself,  not  as

individuals but as mankind. Let us reflect, let us think back; let us follow the

highways and byways!

  ( A )

  Man  seeks  "the  truth":  a  world  that  is  not  self-contradictory,  not

deceptive, does not change, a true world--a world in which one does not

suffer;  contradiction,  deception,  change--causes  of  suffering!  He  does  not

doubt that a world as it ought to be exists; he would like to seek out the road

to it. (Indian critique: e.g. the "ego" as apparent, as not real.)

  Whence  does  man  here  derive  the  concept  reality--Why  is  it  that  he

derives suffering from change, deception, contradiction? and why not rather

his happiness?--

    Contempt, hatred for all that perishes, changes, varies-- whence comes

this valuation of that which remains constant? Obviously, the will to truth is

here merely the desire for a world of the constant.

  The  senses  deceive,  reason  corrects  the  errors;  consequently,  one

concluded, reason is the road to the constant; the least sensual ideas must be

closest to the "true world."--It is from the senses that most misfortunes come-

-they are deceivers, deluders, destroyers.--

  Happiness  can  be  guaranteed  only  by  being;  change  and  happiness

exclude one another. The highest desire therefore contemplates unity with

what has being. This is the formula for: the road to the highest happiness.

  In summa: the world as it ought to be exists; this world, in which we live,

is an error--this world of ours ought not to exist.

  Belief in what has being is only a consequence: the real primum mobile is

disbelief in becoming, mistrust of becoming, the low valuation of all thatbecomes--

  What kind of man reflects in this way? An unproductive, suffering kind, a

kind weary of life. If we imagine the opposite kind of man, he would not

need to believe in what has being; more, he would despise it as dead, tedious,

indifferent--

  The belief that the world as it ought to be is, really exists, is a belief of the

unproductive who do not desire to create a world as it ought to be. They posit

it as already available, they seek ways and means of reaching it. "Will to

truth"--as the impotence of the will to create.

  To know that something is thus and thus:

  To act so that something becomes thus and thus:

    Antagonism in the degree of power in different natures.

  The fiction of a world that corresponds to our desires: psychological trick

and interpretation with the aim of associating everything we honor and find

pleasant with this true world.

  "Will to truth" at this stage is essentially an art of interpretation: which at

least requires the power to interpret.

  This same species of man, grown one stage poorer, no longer possessing

the strength to interpret, to create fictions, produces nihilists. A nihilist is a

man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world

as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence

(action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of "in vain" is

the nihilists' pathos--at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part

of the nihilists.

  Whoever  is  incapable  of  laying  his  will  into  things,  lacking  will  and

strength, at least lays some meaning into them, i.e., the faith that there is a

will in them already.

  It is a measure of the degree of strength of will to what extent one can do

without  meaning  in  things,  to  what  extent  one  can  endure  to  live  in  a

meaningless world because one organizes a small portion of it oneself.

  The philosophical objective outlook can therefore be a sign that will and

strength are small. For strength organizes what is close and closest; "men of

knowledge," who desire only to ascertain what is, are those who cannot fix

anything as it ought to be.

  Artists, an intermediary species: they at least fix an image of that which

ought to be; they are productive, to the extent that they actualy alter and

transform; unlike men of knowledge, who leave everything as it is.    Connection between philosophers and the pessimistic religions: the same

species of man (--they ascribe the highest degree of reality to the most highly

valued things--).

    Connection between philosophers and moral men and their evaluations (--

the moral interpretation of the world as meaning: after the decline of the

religious meaning--).

  Overcoming  of  philosophers  through  the  destruction  of  the  world  of

being: intermediary period of nihilism: before there is yet present the strength

to reverse values and to de�fy becoming and the apparent world as the only

world, and to call them good.

  ( B )

  Nihilism  as  a  normal  phenomenon  can  be  a  symptom  of  increasing

strength or of increasing weakness:

  partly, because the strength to create, to will, has so increased that it no

longer  requires  these  total  interpretations  and  introductions  of  meaning

("present tasks," the state, etc.);

  partly because even the creative strength to create meaning has declined

and  disappointment  becomes  the  dominant  condition.  The  incapability  of

believing in a "meaning," "unbelief."

  What does science mean in regard to both possibilities?

  1. As a sign of strength and self-control, as being able to do without

healing, comforting worlds of illusion;

  2. as undermining, dissecting, disappointing, weakening.

  ( C )

  Belief  in  truth,  the  need  to  have  a  hold  on  something  believed  true,

psychological reduction apart from all previous value feelings. Fear, laziness.

  The  same  way,  unbelief:  reduction.  To  what  extent  it  acquires  a  new

value if a true world does not exist (--thus the value feelings that hitherto

have been squandered on the world of being, are again set free).

  586 (March-June 1888)

  The "True" and the "Apparent World"

  ( A )

  The seductions that occur from this concept are of three kinds

  a.  an  unknown  world:--we  are  adventurers,  inquisitive--  that  which  is

known seems to weary us (--the danger of this Concept lies in its insinuation

that "this" world is known to us--);

  b. another world, where things are different; something in us calculates,our still submission, our silence, lose their value-- perhaps everything will

turn  out  well,  we  have  not  hoped  in  vain  --the  world  where  things  are

different, where we ourselves-- who knows?--are different--

  c. a true world: this is the most amazing trick and attack that has ever

been perpetrated upon us; so much has become encrusted in the word "true,"

and involuntarily we make a present of all this to the "true world": the true

world must also be a truthful world, one that does not deceive us, does not

make fools of us: to believe in it is virtually to be compelled to believe in it (-

-out of decency, as is the case among people worthy of confidence--).

  The concept "the unknown world" insinuates that this world is "known"

to us (is tedious--);

  the concept "another world" insinuates that the world could be otherwise-

-abolishes necessity and fate (useless to submit oneself--to adapt oneself--);

  the  concept  "the  true  world"  insinuates  that  this  world  is  untruthful,

deceptive,  dishonest,  inauthentic,  inessential--and  consequently  also  not  a

world adapted to our needs (--inadvisable to adapt oneself to it; better to

resist it).

  We therefore elude "this" world in three ways:

  a. by our inquisitiveness--as if the more interesting part were elsewhere;

  b. by our submission--as though it were not necessary to submit oneself--

as if this world were not a necessity of the ultimate rank:

  c. by our sympathy and respect--as if this world did not deserve them,

were impure, were not honest with us--

  In summa: we have revolted in three ways: we have made an "x" into a

critique of the "known world."

  ( B )

  First step toward sobriety: to grasp to what extent we have been seduced--

for things could be exactly the reverse:

  a. the unknown world could be a stupid and meaner form of existence--

and "this" world might be rather enjoyable by comparison;

  b. the other world, far from taking account of our desires which would

find no fulfillment in it, could be among the mass of things that make this

world possible for us: to get to know it might be a means of making us

contented;

  c. the true world: but who is it really who tells us that the apparent world

must be of less value than the true one? Does our instinct not contradict this

judgment?  Does  man  not  eternally  create  a  fictitious  world  for  himselfbecause he wants a better world than reality? Above all: how do we arrive at

the idea that our world is not the true world?--it could be that the other world

is the "apparent" one (in fact the Greeks thought of, e.g., a shadow kingdom,

an apparent existence, beside true existence). And finally: what gives us the

right to posit, as it were, degrees of reality? This is something different from

an  unknown  world--  it  is  already  a  wanting  to  know  something  of  the

unknown-- The "other," the "unknown" world--very good! But to say "true

world"  means  "to  know  something  of  it"--That  is  the  opposite  of  the

assumption of an "x" world--

  In  summa:  the  world  "x"  could  be  in  every  sense  more  tedious,  less

human, and less worthy than this world.

  It would be another thing to assert the existence of "x" worlds, i.e., of

every possible world besides this one. But this has never been asserted--

  ( C )

  Problem: why the notion of another world has always been unfavorable

for, or critical of "this" world--what does this indicate?--

  For a people proud of itself, whose life is ascending, always thinks of

another kind of being as a lower, less valuable kind of being; it regards the

strange,  the  unknown  world  as  its  enemy,  as  its  opposite;  it  feels  no

inquisitiveness, it totally rejects the strange--A people would never admit that

another people was the "true people."--

  It is symptomatic that such a distinction should be at all possible--that one

takes this world for the "apparent" one and the other world as "true."

  The places of origin of the notion of "another world": the philosopher,

who invents a world of reason, where reason and the logical functions are

adequate: this is the origin of the "true" world;

  the religious man, who invents a "divine world": this is the origin of the

"denaturalized, anti- natural" world;

  the moral man, who invents a "free world": this is the origin of the "good,

perfect, just, holy" world.

  What  the  three  places  of  origin  have  in  common:  the  psycho-logical

blunder, the physiological confusions.

  By what attributes is the "other world," as it actually appears in history,

distinguished? By the stigmata of philosophical, religious, moral prejudice.

  The  "other  world,"  as  illumined  by  these  facts,  as  a  synonym  for

nonbeing, nonliving, not wanting to live--

  General insight: it is the instinct of life-weariness, and not that of life,which has created the "other world."

    Consequence:  philosophy,  religion,  and  morality  are  symptoms  of

decadence. 11. Biological Value of Knowledge

  587 (1885-1886)

  It might seem as though I had evaded the question of "certainty." The

opposite is true; but by inquiring after the criterion of certainty I tested the

scales  upon  which  men  have  weighed  in  general  hitherto--and  that  the

question of certainty itself is a dependent question, a question of the second

rank.

  588 (1883-1886)

  The  question  of  values  is  more  fundamental  than  the  question  of

certainty:  the  latter  becomes  serious  only  by  presupposing  that  the  value

question has already been answered.

  Being and appearance, psychologically considered, yield no "being-in-

itself,, no criterion of "reality," but only for grades of appearance measured

by the strength of the interest we show in an appearance.

  There is no struggle for existence between ideas and perceptions but a

struggle  for  dominion:  the  idea  that  is  overcome  is  not  annihilated,  only

driven back or subordinated. There is no annihilation in the sphere of spirit--

  589 (1885-1886)

  "Ends and means" "Cause and effect" "Subject and object" "Acting and

suffering" "Thing-in-itself and appearance"

  as  interpretations  (not  as  facts)  and  to  what  extent  perhaps  necessary

interpretations? (as required for "preservation")--all in the sense of a will to

power.

  590 (1885-1886)

  Our values are interpreted into things. Is there then any meaning in the in-

itself? ! Is meaning not necessarily relative meaning and perspective? All

meaning is will to power (all relative meaning resolves itself into it).

  591 (1885)

  The desire for "solid facts" epistemology: how much pessimism there is

in it!

  592 (1883-1888)

  The antagonism between the "true world," as revealed by pessimism, and

a world possible for life--here one must test the rights of truth. It is necessary

to measure the meaning of all these "ideal drives" against life to grasp what

this antagonism really is: the struggle of sickly, despairing life that cleaves toa beyond, with healthier, more stupid and mendacious, richer, less degenerate

life. Therefore it is not "truth" in struggle with life but one kind of life in

struggle with another.--But it wants to be the higher kind!-- Here one must

demonstrate the need for an order of rank--that the first problem is the order

of rank of different kinds of life,

  593 (1885-1886)

  To transform the belief "it is thus and thus" into the will "it shall become

thus and thus." 12. Science

  594 (1883-1888)

    Science--this has been hitherto a way of putting an end to the complete

confusion in which things exist, by hypotheses that "explain" everything--so

it has come from the intellect's dislike of chaos.--This same dislike seizes me

when I consider myself: I should like to form an image of the inner world

too, by means of some schema, and thus triumph over intellectual confusion.

Morality  has  been  a  simplification  of  this  kind:  it  taught  that  men  were

known, familiar.--Now we have destroyed morality--we have again become

completely  obscure  to  ourselves!  I  know  that  I  know  nothing  of  myself.

Physics proves to be a boon for the heart: science (as the way to knowledge)

acquires a new charm after morality has been eliminated--and because it is

here alone that we find consistency, we have to construct our life so as to

preserve it. This yields a sort of practical reflection on the conditions of our

existence as men of knowledge.

  595 (1884)

  Our  presuppositions:  no  God:  no  purpose:  finite  force.  Let  us  guard

against thinking out and prescribing the mode of thought necessary to lesser

men!!

  596 (1886-1887)

  No "moral education" of the human race: but an enforced schooling in

[scientific] errors is needed, because "truth" disgusts and makes one sick of

life--unless man is already irrevocably launched upon his path and has taken

his honest insight upon himself with a tragic pride.

  597 (1886-1887)

  The presupposition of scientific work: belief in the unity and perpetuity of

scientific  work,  so  the  individual  may  work  at  any  part,  however  small,

confident that his work will not be in vain.

  There is one great paralysis: to work in vain, to struggle in vain.

  The  accumulative  epochs,  in  which  force  and  means  of  power  arediscovered that the future will one day make use of; science an intermediary

station, at which the more intermediary, more multifarious, more complicated

natures  find  their  most  natural  discharge  and  satisfaction--all  those  who

should avoid action.

  598 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  A  philosopher  recuperates  differently  and  with  different  means:  he

recuperates,  e.g.,  with  nihilism.  Belief  that  there  is  no  truth  at  all,  the

nihilistic belief, is a great relaxation for one who, as a warrior of knowledge,

is ceaselessly fighting ugly truths. For truth is ugly.

  599 (1885-1886)

  The "meaninglessness of events": belief in this is the consequence of an

insight  into  the  falsity  of  previous  interpretations,  a  generalization  of

discouragement and weakness--not a necessary belief.

  The immodesty of man: to deny meaning where he sees none.

  600 (1885-1886)

  No  limit  to  the  ways  in  which  the  world  can  be  interpreted;  every

interpretation a symptom of growth or of decline.

  Inertia  needs  unity  (monism);  plurality  of  interpretations  a  sign  of

strength. Not to desire to deprive the world of its disturbing and enigmatic

character!

  601 (1885-1886)

  Against peaceableness and the desire for reconciliation. The attempt at

monism belongs here.

  602 (1884)

  This perspective world, this world for the eye, tongue, and ear, is very

false, even if compared for a very much more subtle sense-apparatus. But its

intelligibility, comprehensibility, practicability, and beauty begin to cease if

we refine our senses; just as beauty ceases when we think about historical

processes; the order of purpose is already an illusion. It suffices that the more

superficially  and  coarsely  it  is  conceived,  the  more  valuable,  definite,

beautiful, and significant the world appears. The deeper one looks, the more

our valuations disappear--meaninglessness approaches! We have created the

world that possesses values! Knowing this, we know, too, that reverence for

truth is already the consequence of an illusion--and that one should value

more than truth the force that forms, simplifies, shapes, invents.

    "Everything is false! Everything is permitted!"

  Only with a certain obtuseness of vision, a will to simplicity, does thebeautiful, the "valuable" appear: in itself, it is I know not what.

  603 (1885)

  That the destruction of an illusion does not produce truth-- but only one

more piece of ignorance, an extension of our "empty space, an increase of our

"desert"--

  604 ( 1885-1886)

    "Interpretation," the introduction of meaning not "explanation" (in most

cases  a  new  interpretation  over  an  old  interpretation  that  has  become

incomprehensible,  that  is  now  itself  only  a  sign).  There  are  no  facts,

everything  is  in  flux,  incomprehensible,  elusive;  what  is  relatively  most

enduring is--our opinions.

  605 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  The  ascertaining  of  "truth"  and  "untruth,"  the  ascertaining  of  facts  in

general,  is  fundamentally  different  from  creative  positing,  from  forming,

shaping, overcoming, willing, such as is of the essence of philosophy. To

introduce a meaning--this task still remains to be done, assuming there is no

meaning yet. Thus it is with sounds, but also with the fate of peoples: they are

capable of the most different interpretations and direction toward different

goals.

  On a yet higher level is to posit a goal and mold facts according to it; that

is, active interpretation and not merely conceptual translation.

  606 (1885-1886)

  Ultimately, man finds in things nothing but what he himself has imported

into them: the finding is called science, the importing --art, religion, love,

pride. Even if this should be a piece of childishness, one should carry on with

both and be well disposed toward both--some should find; others--we others!-

-should import!

  607 (Spring-Fall 1886)

  Science: its two sides: in regard to the individual; in regard to the cultural

complex (level);

    --valuations from one side or the other are mutually antagonistic.

  608 (1886-1887)

  The development of science resolves the "familiar" more and more into

the  unfamiliar:--it  desires,  however,  the  reverse,  and  proceeds  from  the

instinct to trace the unfamiliar back to the familiar.

  In summa, science is preparing a sovereign ignorance, a feeling that there

is no such thing as "knowing," that it was a kind of arrogance to dream of it,more, that we no longer have the least notion that warrants our considering

"knowledge" even a possibility--that "knowing" itself is a contradictory idea.

We translate a primeval mythology and vanity of mankind into the hard fact:

"knowledge-in-itself"  is  as  impermissible  a  concept  as  is  "thing-initself."

Seduction by "number and logic," seduction by "laws."

    "Wisdom"  as  the  attempt  to  get  beyond  perspective  valuations  (i.e.,

beyond  the  "will  to  power"):  a  principle  hostile  to  life  and  decadent,  a

symptom  as  among  the  Indians,  etc.,  of  the  weakening  of  the  power  of

appropriation.

  609 (1884)

  It is not enough that you understand in what ignorance man and beast

live; you must also have and acquire the will to ignorance. You need to grasp

that without this kind of ignorance life itself would be impossible, that it is a

condition under which alone the living thing can preserve itself and prosper:

a great, firm dome of ignorance must encompass you.

  610 (1884)

  Science--the transformation of nature into concepts for the purpose of

mastering nature--belongs under the rubric "means."

  But the purpose and will of man must grow in the same way, the intention

in regard to the whole.

  611 (1883-1888)

  We find that the strongest and most constantly employed faculty at all

stages  of  life  is  thought--even  in  every  act  of  perceiving  and  apparent

passivity! Evidently, it thus becomes most powerful and demanding, and in

the long run it tyrannizes over all other forces. Finally it becomes "passion-

in-itself."

  612 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  To win back for the man of knowledge the right to great affects! after

self-effacement and the cult of "objectivity" have created a false order of rank

in this sphere, too. Error reached its peak when Schopenhauer taught: the

only  way  to  the  "true,"  to  knowledge,  lies  precisely  in  getting  free  from

affects, from will; the intellect liberated from will cannot but see the true, real

essence of things.

  The same error in arte as if everything were beautiful as soon as it is

viewed without will.

  613 (Fall 1888)

    Competition between affects and the dominion of one of the affects overthe intellect.

  614 (1884)

  To "humanize" the world, i.e., to feel ourselves more and more masters

within it--

  615 (1884)

  Among  a  higher  kind  of  creatures,  knowledge,  too,  will  acquire  new

forms that are not yet needed.

  616 (1885-1886)

  That  the  value  of  the  world  lies  in  our  interpretation  (--that  other

interpretations than merely human ones are perhaps somewhere possible--);

that previous interpretations have been perspective valuations by virtue of

which we can survive in life, i.e., in the will to power, for the growth of

power; that every elevation of man brings with it the overcoming of narrower

interpretations; that every strengthening and increase of power opens up new

perspectives and means believing in new horizons--this idea permeates my

writings. The world with which we are concerned is false, i.e., is not a fact

but a fable and approximation on the basis of a meager sum of observations;

it is "in flux," as something in a state of becoming, as a falsehood always

changing but never getting near the truth: for--there is no "truth."

  617 (1883-1885)

  To impose upon becoming the character of being--that is the supreme will

to power.

  Twofold  falsification,  on  the  part  of  the  senses  and  of  the  spirit,  to

preserve a world of that which is, which abides, which is equivalent, etc.

  That  everything  recurs  is  the  closest  approximation  of  a  world  of

becoming to a world of being:--high point of the meditation.

  From  the  values  attributed  to  being  proceed  the  condemnation  of  and

discontent  with  becoming,  after  such  a  world  of  being  had  first  been

invented.

  The metamorphoses of what has being (body, God, ideas, laws of nature,

formulas, etc.)

    "Beings" as appearance; reversal of values; appearance was that which

conferred value--.

    Knowledge-in-itself  in  a  world  of  becoming  is  impossible;  so  how  is

knowledge possible? As error concerning oneself, as will to power, as will to

deception.

  Becoming as invention, willing, self-denial, overcoming of oneself: nosubject but an action, a positing, creative, no "causes and effects."

  Art  as  the  will  to  overcome  becoming,  as  "eternalization,"  but

shortsighted, depending on the perspective: repeating in miniature, as it were,

the tendency of the whole.

  Regarding that which all life reveals as a diminutive formula for the total

tendency; hence a new definition of the concept "life" as will to power.

  Instead of "cause and effect" the mutual struggle of that which becomes,

often  with  the  absorption  of  one's  opponent;  the  number  of  becoming

elements not constant.

    Uselessness of old ideals for the interpretation of the totality of events,

once one knows the animal origin and utility of these ideals; all, moreover,

contradictory to life.

    Uselessness  of  the  mechanistic  theory--it  gives  the  impression  of

meaninglessness.

  The  entire  idealism  of  mankind  hitherto  is  on  the  point  of  changing

suddenly  into  nihilism--into  the  belief  in  absolute  worthlessness,  i.e.,

meaninglessness.

  The destruction of ideals, the new desert; new arts by means of which we

can endure it, we amphibians.

  -  Presupposition:  bravery,  patience,  no  "turning  back,"  no  haste  to  go

forward.  (N.B.  Zarathustra  adopts  a  parodistic  attitude  toward  all  former

values as a consequence of his abundance.)

    Excerpts

  BOOK IV DISCIPLINE AND BREEDING

  I. Order of Rank

  1. The Doctrine of Order of Rank

  858 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  What determines your rank is the quantum of power you are: the rest is

cowardice.

  862 (1884)

  A  doctrine  is  needed  powerful  enough  to  work  as  a  breeding  agent:

strengthening the strong, paralyzing and destructive for the world-weary.

  The  annihilation  of  the  decaying  races.  Decay  of  Europe.--  The

annihilation of slavish evaluations.-- Dominion over the earth as a means of

producing a higher type.-- The annihilation of the tartuffery called "morality"

(Christianity as a hysterical kind of honesty in this: Augustine, Bunyan).--The  annihilation  of  suffrage  universel;  i.e.,  the  system  through  which  the

lowest natures prescribe themselves as laws for the higher.-- The annihilation

of  mediocrity  and  its  acceptance.  (The  one-sided,  individuals--peoples;  to

strive for fullness of nature through the pairing of opposites: race mixture to

this end).-- The new courage--no a priori truths (such truths were sought by

those accustomed to faith!), but a free subordination to a ruling idea that has

its time: e.g., time as a property of space, etc.

  2. The Strong and the Weak

  871 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  The victorious and unbridled: their depressive influence on the value of

the desires. It was the dreadful barbarism of custom that, especially in the

Middle  Ages,  compelled  the  creation  of  a  veritable  "league  of  virtue"--

together with an equally dreadful exaggeration of that which constitutes the

value of man. Struggling "civilization" (taming) needs every kind of irons

and torture to maintain itself against terribleness and beast-of-prey natures.

  Here a confusion is quite natural, although its influence has been fatal:

that which men of power and will are able to demand of themselves also

provides a measure of that which they may permit themselves. Such natures

are the antithesis of the vicious and unbridled: although they may on occasion

do things that would convict a lesser man of vice and immoderation.

  Here  the  concept  of  the  "equal  value  of  men  before  God"  is

extraordinarily  harmful;  one  forbade  actions  and  attitudes  that  were  in

themselves  among  the  prerogatives  of  the  strongly  constituted--as  if  they

were in themselves unworthy of men. One brought the entire tendency of the

strong into disrepute when one erected the protective measures of the weakest

(those who were weakest also when confronting themselves) as a norm of

value.

    Confusion went so far that one branded the very virtuosi of life (whose

autonomy offered the sharpest antithesis to the vicious and unbridled) with

the most opprobrious names. Even now one believes one must disapprove of

a Cesare Borgia; that is simply laughable. The church has excommunicated

German emperors on account of their vices: as if a monk or priest had any

right to join in a discussion about what a Frederick II may demand of himself.

A Don Juan is sent to hell: that is very naive. Has it been noticed that in

heaven all interesting men are missing?-- Just a hint to the girls as to where

they can best find their salvation.-- If one reflects with some consistency, and

moreover  with  a  deepened  insight  into  what  a  "great  man"  is,  no  doubtremains that the church sends all "great men" to hell--it fights against all

"greatness of man."

  877 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

  The revolution made Napoleon possible: that is its justification. For the

sake of a similar prize one would have to desire the anarchical collapse of our

entire civilization. Napoleon made nationalism possible: that is its excuse.

  The value of a man (apart from his morality or immorality, naturally; for

with these concepts the value of a man is not even touched) does not reside in

his utility; for it would continue to exist even if there were no one to whom

he could be of any use. And why could not precisely that man who produced

the most disastrous effects be the pinnacle of the whole species of man: so

high, so superior that everything would perish from envy of him?

  893 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Hatred of mediocrity is unworthy of a philosopher: it is almost a question

mark against his "right to philosophy." Precisely because he is an exception

he has to take the rule under his protection, he has to keep the mediocre in

good heart.

  898 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  The strong of the future.-- That which partly necessity, partly chance has

achieved here and there, the conditions for the production of a stronger type,

we are now able to comprehend and consciously will: we are able to create

the conditions under which such an elevation is possible.

  Until  now,  "education"  has  had  in  view  the  needs  of  society:  not  the

possible needs of the future, but the needs of the society of the day. One

desired to produce "tools" for it. Assuming the wealth of force were greater,

one could imagine forces being subtracted, not to serve the needs of society

but some future need.

  Such a task would have to be posed the more it was grasped to what

extent  the  contemporary  form  of  society  was  being  so  powerfully

transformed that at some future time it would be unable to exist for its own

sake alone, but only as a tool in the hands of a stronger race.

  The increasing dwarfing of man is precisely the driving force that brings

to  mind  the  breeding  of  a  stronger  race--a  race  that  would  be  excessive

precisely where the dwarfed species was weak and growing weaker (in will,

responsibility, self-assurance, ability to posit goals for oneself).

  The means would be those history teaches: isolation through interests in

preservation  that  are  the  reverse  of  those  which  are  average  today;habituation to reverse evaluations; distance as a pathos; a free conscience in

those things that today are most undervalued and prohibited.

  The homogenizing of European man is the great process that cannot be

obstructed: one should even hasten it. The necessity to create a gulf, distance,

order of rank, is given eo ipso--not the necessity to retard the process.

  As  soon  as  it  is  established,  this  homogenizing  species  requires  a

justification: it lies in serving a higher sovereign species that stands upon the

former and can raise itself to its task only by doing this. Not merely a master

race whose sole task is to rule, but a race with its own sphere of life, with an

excess of strength for beauty, bravery, culture, manners to the highest peak of

the spirit; an affirming race that may grant itself every great luxury--strong

enough to have no need of the tyranny of the virtue-imperative, rich enough

to have no need of thrift and pedantry, beyond good and evil; a hothouse for

strange and choice plants.

  899 (1885)

  Our psychologists, whose glance lingers involuntarily on symptoms of

decadence alone, again and again induce us to mistrust the spirit. One always

sees  only  those  effects  of  the  spirit  that  make  men  weak,  delicate,  and

morbid; but now there are coming new barbarians { cynics experimenters

conquerors } union of spiritual superiority with well-being and an excess of

strength.

  900 (1885)

  I point to something new: certainly for such a democratic type there exists

the danger of the barbarian, but one has looked for it only in the depths.

There exists also another type of barbarian, who comes from the heights: a

species  of  conquering  and  ruling  natures  in  search  of  material  to  mold.

Prometheus was this kind of barbarian.

  909 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

  The typical forms of self-formation. Or: the eight principal questions.

  1. Whether one wants to be more multifarious or simpler? 2. Whether one

wants to become happier or more indifferent to happiness and unhappiness?

3.  Whether  one  wants  to  become  more  contented  with  oneself  or  more

exacting  and  inexorable?  4.  Whether  one  wants  to  become  softer,  more

yielding, more human, or more "inhuman"? 5. Whether one wants to become

more prudent or more ruthless? 6. Whether one wants to reach a goal or to

avoid all goals (as, e.g., the philosopher does who smells a boundary, a nook,

a prison, a stupidity in every goal)? 7. Whether one wants to become morerespected  or  more  feared?  Or  more  despised?  8.  Whether  one  wants  to

become tyrant or seducer or shepherd or herd animal?

  910 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Types of my disciples.-- To those human beings who are of any concern

to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities--I wish

that  they  should  not  remain  unfamiliar  with  profound  self-contempt,  the

torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for

them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is

worth anything or not--that one endures. [The note continues in Nietzsche's

MS: "I have not yet got to know any idealist, but many liars---"]

  916 (1884; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)

  What has been ruined by the church's misuse of it:

  1. asceticism: one has hardly the courage so far to display its natural

utility, its indispensability in the service of the education of the will. Our

absurd pedagogic world, before which the "useful civil servant" hovers as a

model, thinks it can get by with "instruction," with brain drill; it has not the

slightest idea that something else is needed first--education of will power;

one devises tests for everything except for the main thing: whether one can

will, whether one may promise; the young man finishes school without a

single question, without any curiosity even, concerning this supreme value-

problem of his nature;

  2. fasting: in every sense--even as a means of preserving the delicacy of

one's  ability  to  enjoy  all  good  things  (e.g.,  occasionally  to  stop  reading,

listening to music, being pleasant; one must have fast days for one's virtues,

too);

  3. the "monastery": temporary isolation, accompanied by strict refusal,

e.g., of letters; a kind of most profound self-reflection and self-recovery that

desires to avoid, not "temptations," but "duties": an escape from the daily

round;  a  detachment  from  they  tyranny  of  stimuli  and  influences  that

condemns us to spend our strength in nothing but reactions and does not

permit  the  accumulation  to  the  point  of  spontaneous  activity  (one  should

observe our scholars from close up: they think only reactively; i.e., they have

to read before they can think);

  4. feasts: One has to be very coarse in order not to feel the presence of

Christians and Christian values as an oppression beneath which all genuine

festive  feelings  go  to  the  devil.  Feasts  include:  pride,  exuberance,

wantonness;  mockery  of  everything  serious  and  Philistine;  a  divineaffirmation of oneself out of animal plenitude and perfection--one and all

states which the Christian cannot honestly welcome. The feast is paganism

par excellence;

  5.  courage  confronted  with  one's  own  nature:  dressing  up  in  "moral

costumes.-- That one has no need of moral formulas in order to welcome an

affect; standard: how far we can affirm what is nature in us--how much or

how little we need to have recourse to morality;

  6. death-- One must convert the stupid physiological fact into a moral

necessity. So to live that one can also will at the right time to die!

  918 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

  One would make a fit little boy stare if one asked him: "Would you like to

become virtuous?"-- but he will open his eyes wide if asked: "Would you like

to become stronger than your friends?"--

  3. The Noble Man

  941 (Summer-Fall 1883)

  The  meaning  of  our  gardens  and  palaces  (and  to  this  extent  also  the

meaning of all desire for riches) is to remove disorder and vulgarity from

sight and to build a home for nobility of soul.

  The majority, to be sure, believe they will acquire higher natures when,

those beautiful, peaceful objects have operated upon them: hence the rush to

go to Italy and on travels, etc.; all reading and visits to theaters. They want to

have themselves formed--that is the meaning of their cultural activity! But the

strong, the mighty want to form and no longer to have anything foreign about

them!

  Thus men also plunge into wild nature, not to find themselves but to lose

and forget themselves in it. "To be outside oneself" as the desire of all the

weak and the self-discontented.

  942 (1885)

  There is only nobility of birth, only nobility of blood. (I am not speaking

here  of  the  little  word  "von"  or  of  the  Almanach  de  Gotha  [Genealogy

reference book of the royal families of Europe.]: parenthesis for asses.) When

one speaks of "aristocrats of the spirit," reasons are usually not lacking for

concealing  something;  as  is  well  known,  it  is  a  favorite  term  among

ambitious Jews. For spirit alone does not make noble; rather, there must be

something to ennoble the spirit.-- What then is required? Blood.

  949 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

  That one stakes one's life, one's health, one's honor, is the consequence ofhigh  spirits  and  an  overflowing,  prodigal  will:  not  from  love  of  man  but

because every great danger challenges our curiosity about the degree of our

strength and our courage.

  4. The Masters of the Earth

  958 (1884)

  I write for a species of man that does not yet exist: for the "masters of the

earth."

    Religions, as consolations and relaxations, dangerous: man believes he

has a right to take his ease.

  In Plato's Theages it is written: "Each one of us would like to be master

over all men, if possible, and best of all God." This attitude must exist again.

    Englishmen, Americans, and Russians---

  960 (1885-1886)

  From  now  on  there  will  be  more  favorable  preconditions  for  more

comprehensive forms of dominion, whose like has never yet existed. And

even this is not the most important thing; the possibility has been established

for the production of international racial unions whose task will be to rear a

master  race,  the  future  "masters  of  the  earth";--a  new,  tremendous

aristocracy,  based  on  the  severest  self-legislation,  in  which  the  will  of

philosophical men of power and artist-tyrants will be made to endure for

millennia--a  higher  kind  of  man  who,  thanks  to  their  superiority  in  will,

knowledge, riches, and influence, employ democratic Europe as their most

pliant and supple instrument for getting hold of the destinies of the earth, so

as to work as artists upon "man" himself. Enough: the time is coming when

politics will have a different meaning.

  5. The Great Human Being

  966 (1884)

  In contrast to the animals, man has cultivated an abundance of contrary

drives and impulses within himself: thanks to this synthesis, he is master of

the earth.-- Moralities are the expression of locally limited orders of rank in

his  multifarious  world  of  drives,  so  man  should  not  perish  through  their

contradictions. Thus a drive as master, its opposite weakened, refined, as the

impulse that provides the stimulus for the activity of the chief drive.

  The highest man would have the greatest multiplicity of drives, in the

relatively  greatest  strength  that  can  be  endured.  Indeed,  where  the  plant

"man" shows himself strongest one finds instincts that conflict powerfully

(e.g., in Shakespeare), but are controlled.  6. The Highest Man as Legislator of the Future

  981 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  Not to make men "better," not to preach morality to them in any form, as

if "morality in itself," or any ideal kind of man, were given; but to create

conditions  that  require  stronger  men  who  for  their  part  need,  and

consequently  will  have,  a  morality  (more  clearly:  a  physical-spiritual

discipline) that makes them strong!

  Not  to  allow  oneself  to  be  misled  by  blue  eyes  or  heaving  bosoms:

greatness of soul has nothing romantic about it. And unfortunately nothing at

all amiable.

  984 (1884)

  Greatness of soul is inseparable from greatness of spirit. For it involves

independence; but in the absence of spiritual greatness, independence ought

not to be allowed, it causes mischief, even through its desire to do good and

practice "justice." Small spirits must obey--hence cannot possess greatness.

  II. Dionysus

  1003 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

  To him who has turned out well, who does my heart good, carved from

wood  that  is  hard,  gentle,  and  fragrant--in  whom  even  the  nose  takes

pleasure--this book is dedicated.

  He enjoys the taste of what is wholesome for him;

  his pleasure in anything ceases when the bounds of the wholesome are

crossed;

  he  divines  the  remedies  for  partial  injuries;  he  has  illnesses  as  great

stimulants of his life;

  he knows how to exploit ill chances;

  he grows stronger through the accidents that threaten to destroy him;

  he instinctively gathers from all that he sees, hears, experiences, what

advances his main concern--he follows a principle of selection--he allows

much to fall through;

  he reacts with the slowness bred by a long caution and a deliberate pride--

he tests a stimulus for its origin and its intentions, he does not submit;

  he is always in his own company, whether he deals with books, men, or

landscapes;

  he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting.

  1007 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  To  revalue  values--what  would  that  mean?  All  the  spontaneous--new,future, stronger--movements must be there; but they still appear under false

names and valuations and have not yet become conscious of themselves.

  A  courageous  becoming-conscious  and  affirmation  of  what  has  been

achieved--a  liberation  from  the  slovenly  routine  of  old  valuations  that

dishonor us in the best and strongest things we have achieved.

  1017 (Spring-Fall 1887)

  In place of the "natural man" of Rousseau, the nineteenth century has

discovered a truer image of "man"--it has had the courage to do so.-- On the

whole, the Christian concept "man" has thus been reinstated. What one has

not had the courage for is to call this "man in himself" good and to see in him

the guarantee of the future. Neither has one dared to grasp that an increase in

the terribleness of man is an accompaniment of every increase in culture; in

this,  one  is  still  subject  to  the  Christian  ideal  and  takes  its  side  against

paganism,  also  against  the  Renaissance  concept  of  virt�.  But  the  key  to

culture  is  not  to  be  found  in  this  way:  and  in  praxis  one  retains  the

falsification of history in favor of the "good man" (as if he alone constituted

the progress of man) and the socialist ideal (i.e., the residue of Christianity

and of Rousseau in the de-Christianized world).

  The struggle against the eighteenth century: its supreme overcoming by

Goethe  and  Napoleon.  Schopenhauer,  too,  struggles  against  it;  but  he

involuntarily steps back into the seventeenth century--he is a modern Pascal,

with Pascalian value judgments without Christianity. Schopenhauer was not

strong enough for a new Yes.

  Napoleon: insight that the higher and the terrible man necessarily belong

together. The "man" reinstated; the woman again accorded her due tribute of

contempt and fear. "Totality" as health and highest activity; the straight line,

the grand style in action rediscovered; the most powerful instinct, that of life

itself, the lust to rule, affirmed.

  1023 (March-June 1888)

  Pleasure appears where there is the feeling of power.

    Happiness: in the triumphant consciousness of power and victory.

    Progress:  the  strengthening  of  the  type,  the  ability  for  great  willing;

everything else is misunderstanding, danger.

  1026 (Summer-Fall 1883)

  Not  "happiness  follows  virtue"--but  the  more  powerful  man  first

designates his happy state as virtue.

  Evil actions belong to the powerful and virtuous: bad, base ones to thesubjected.

  The most powerful man, the creator, would have to be the most evil, in as

much as he carries his ideal against the ideals of other men and remakes them

in his own image. Evil here means: hard, painful, enforced.

  Such men as Napoleon must come again and again and confirm the belief

in the autocracy of the individual: but he himself was corrupted by the means

he had to employ and lost noblesse of character. If he had had to prevail

among a different kind of man he could have employed other means; and it

would thus not seem to be a necessity for a Caesar to become bad.

  1028 (Spring-Fall 1887)

    Terribleness is part of greatness: let us not deceive ourselves.

  1038 (March-Fall 1888)

  --And how many new gods are still possible! As for myself, in whom the

religious, that is to say god-forming, instinct occasionally becomes active at

impossible  times--how  differently,  how  variously  the  divine  has  revealed

itself to me each time!

  So many strange things have passed before me in those timeless moments

that fall into one's life as if from the moon, when one no longer has any idea

how old one is or how young one will yet be--I should not doubt that there

are  many  kinds  of  gods--  There  are  some  one  cannot  imagine  without  a

certain halcyon and frivolous quality in their makeup-- Perhaps light feet are

even an integral part of the concept :god-- Is it necessary to elaborate that a

god prefers to stay beyond everything bourgeois and rational? and, between

ourselves,  also  beyond  good  and  evil?  His  prospect  of  free--in  Goethe's

words.-- And to call upon the inestimable authority of Zarathustra in this

instance: Zarathustra goes so far as to confess: "I would believe only in a God

who could dance"--

  To repeat: how many new gods are still possible! Zarathustra himself, to

be sure, is merely an old atheist: he believes neither in old nor in new gods.

Zarathustra says he would; but Zarathustra will not-- Do not misunderstand

him.

  The type of God after the type of creative spirits, of "great men."

  1049 (1885-1886)

    Apollo's  deception:  the  eternity  of  beautiful  forms;  the  aristocratic

legislation, "thus shall it be for ever!"

    Dionysus: sensuality and cruelty. Transitoriness could be interpreted as

enjoyment of productive and destructive force, as continual creation. III. TheEternal Recurrence

  1053 (1884)

  My philosophy brings the triumphant idea of which all other modes of

thought will ultimately perish. It is the great cultivating idea: the races that

cannot bear it stand condemned; those who find it the greatest benefit are

chosen to rule.

  1054 (1885-1886)

  The greatest of struggles: for this a new weapon is needed.

  The hammer: to provoke a fearful decision, to confront Europe with the

consequences: whether its will "wills" destruction.

  Prevention of reduction to mediocrity. Rather destruction!

  1055 (1885)

  A  pessimistic  teaching  and  way  of  thinking,  an  ecstatic  nihilism,  can

under certain conditions be indispensable precisely to the philosopher--as a

mighty pressure and hammer with which he breaks and removes degenerate

and decaying races to make way for a new order of life, or to implant into

that which is degenerate and desires to die a longing for the end.

  1056 (1884)

  I want to teach the idea that gives many the right to erase themselves--the

great cultivating idea.

  1057 (1883-1888)

  The eternal recurrence. A prophecy. [In the MS: "A Book of Prophecy."

In the so-called Grossoktav edition of 1911, p. 514, this section represents the

plan for a book, The Eternal Recurrence.]

  1.  Presentation  of  the  doctrine  and  its  theoretical  presuppositions  and

consequences.

  2. Proof of the doctrine.

  3. Probable consequences of its being believed (it makes everything break

open). a) Means of enduring it; b) Means of disposing it.

  4.  Its  place  in  history  as  a  mid-point.  Period  of  greatest  danger.

Foundation of an oligarchy above peoples and their interests: education to a

universally human politics. Counterpart of Jesuitism.

  1058 (1883-1888)

  The two great philosophical points of view (devised by Germans):

  a) that of becoming, of development. b) that according to the value of

existence  (but  the  wretched  form  of  German  pessimism  must  first  be

overcome!)--both brought together by me in a decisive way.    Everything  becomes  and  recurs  eternally--escape  is  impossible!--

Supposing we could judge value, what follows? The idea of recurrence as a

selective principle, in the service of strength (and barbarism!!).

    Ripeness of man for this idea.

  1059 (1884)

  1. The idea [of the eternal recurrence]: the presuppositions that would

have to be true if it were true. Its consequences.

  2. As the hardest idea: its probable effect if it were not prevented, i.e., if

all values were not revalued.

  3. Means of enduring it: the revaluation of all values. No longer joy in

certainty but uncertainty; no longer "cause and effect" but the continually

creative; no longer will to preservation but to power; no longer the humble

expression, "everything is merely subjective," but "it is also our work!-- Let

us be proud of it!"

  1060 (1884)

  To endure the idea of the recurrence one needs: freedom from morality;

new means against the fact of pain (pain conceived as a tool, as the father of

pleasure; there is no cumulative consciousness of displeasure); the enjoyment

of  all  kinds  of  uncertainty,  experimentalism,  as  a  counterweight  to  this

extreme  fatalism;  abolition  of  the  concept  of  necessity;  abolition  of  the

"will"; abolition of "knowledge-in-itself."

  Greatest elevation of the consciousness of strength in man, as he creates

the overman.

  1061 (1887-1888)

  The  two  most  extreme  modes  of  thought--the  mechanistic  and  the

Platonic--are reconciled in the eternal recurrence: both as ideals.

  1062 (1885)

  If the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there were for it

some unintended final state, this also must have been reached. If it were in

any  way  capable  of  a  pausing  and  becoming  fixed,  of  "being,"  then  all

becoming would long since have come to an end, along with all thinking, all

"spirit." The fact of "spirit" as a form of becoming proves that the world has

no goal, no final state, and is incapable of being.

  The old habit, however, of associating a goal with every event and a

guiding, creative God with the world, is so powerful that it requires an effort

for a thinker not to fall into thinking of the very aimlessness of the world as

intended. This notion--that the world intentionally avoids a goal and evenknows artifices for keeping itself from entering into a circular course--must

occur to all those who would like to force on the world the ability for eternal

novelty, i.e., on a finite, definite, unchangeable force of constant size, such as

the world is, the miraculous power of infinite novelty in its forms and states.

The world, even if it is no longer a god, is still supposed to be capable of the

divine power of creation, the power of infinite transformations; it is supposed

to  consciously  prevent  itself  from  returning  to  any  of  its  old  forms;  it  is

supposed to possess not only the intention but the means of every one of its

movements at every moment so as to escape goals, final states, repetitions--

and  whatever  else  may  follow  from  such  an  unforgivably  insane  way  of

thinking and desiring. It is still the old religious way of thinking and desiring,

a kind of longing to believe that in some way the world is after all like the old

beloved, infinite, boundlessly creative God--that in some way "the old God

still lives"--that longing of Spinoza which was expressed in the words "deus

sive natura" [God or nature.] (he even felt "natura sive deus").

  What, then, is the law and belief with which the decisive change, the

recently  attained  preponderance  of  the  scientific  spirit  over  the  religious,

God-inventing spirit, is most clearly formulated? Is it not: the world, as force,

may not be thought of as unlimited, for it cannot be so thought of; we forbid

ourselves the concept of an infinite force as incompatible with the concept

"force." Thus--the world also lacks the capacity for eternal novelty.

  1063 (1887-1888)

  The law of the conservation of energy demands eternal recurrence.

  1064 (1885)

  That a state of equilibrium is never reached proves that it is not possible.

But in an indefinite space it would have to have been reached. Likewise in a

spherical space. The shape of space must be the cause of eternal movement,

and ultimately of all "imperfection."

  That "force" and "rest," "remaining the same," contradict one another.

The measure of force (as magnitude) as fixed, but its essence in flux. [The

MS continues: "in tension, compelling."]

    "Timelessness"  to  be  rejected.  At  any  precise  moment  of  a  force,  the

absolute  conditionality  of  a  new  distribution  of  all  its  forces  is  given:  it

cannot  stand  still.  "Change"  belongs  to  the  essence,  therefore  also

temporality:  with  this,  however,  the  necessity  of  change  has  only  been

posited once more conceptually.

  1065 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)  A certain emperor always bore in mind the transitoriness of all things so

as not to take them too seriously and to live at peace among them. To me, on

the contrary, everything seems far too valuable to be so fleeting: I seek an

eternity for everything: ought one to pour the most precious salves and wines

into the sea?-- My consolation is that everything that has been is eternal: the

sea will cast it up again.

  1066 (March-June 1888)

  The new world-conception.-- The world exists; it is not something that

becomes, not something that passes away. Or rather: it becomes, it passes

away, but it has never begun to become and never ceased from passing away-

-it maintains itself in both.-- It lives on itself: its excrements are its food.

  We need not worry for a moment about the hypothesis of a created world.

The concept "create" is today completely indefinable [This word is illegible.],

unrealizable;  merely  a  word,  a  rudimentary  survival  from  the  ages  of

superstition; one can explain nothing with a mere word. The last attempt to

conceive a world that had a beginning has lately been made several times

with the aid of logical procedures--generally, as one may divine, with an

ulterior theological motive.

  Lately one has sought several times to find a contradiction in the concept

"temporal infinity of the world in the past" (regressus in infinitum): one has

even  found  it,  although  at  the  cost  of  confusing  the  head  with  the  tail.

Nothing can prevent me from reckoning backward from this moment and

saying "I shall never reach the end"; just as I can reckon forward from the

same moment into the infinite. Only if I made the mistake--I shall guard

against it--of equating this correct concept of a regressus in infinitum with an

utterly unrealizable concept of a finite progressus up to this present, only if I

suppose  that  the  direction  (forward  or  backward)  is  logically  a  matter  of

indifference, would I take the head--this moment--for the tail: I shall leave

that to you, my dear Herr D�hring!--

  I  have  come  across  this  idea  in  earlier  thinkers:  every  time  it  was

determined by other ulterior considerations (--mostly theological, in favor of

the creator spiritus). If the world could in any way become rigid, dry, dead,

nothing, or if it could reach a state of equilibrium, or if it had any kind of goal

that involved duration, immutability, the once-and-for-all (in short, speaking

metaphysically:  if  becoming  could  resolve  itself  into  being  or  into

nothingness), then this state must have been reached: from which it follows--

  This is the sole certainty we have in our hands to serve as a corrective to agreat  host  of  world  hypotheses  possible  in  themselves.  If,  e.g.,  the

mechanistic theory cannot avoid the consequence, drawn for it by William

Thomson  [First  Baron  Kelvin  (1824-1907),  British  physicist  and

mathematician who introduced the Kelvin or Absolute Scale of temperature.],

of leading to a final state, then the mechanistic theory stands refuted.

  If the world may be thought of as a certain definite quantity of force and

as  a  certain  definite  number  of  centers  of  force--and  every  other

representation remains indefinite and therefore useless--it follows that, in the

great dice game of existence, it must pass through a calculable number of

combinations. In infinite time, every possible combination would at some

time or another be realized; more: it would be realized an infinite number of

times. And since between every combination and its next recurrence all other

possible  combinations  would  have  to  take  place,  and  each  of  these

combinations  conditions  the  entire  sequence  of  combinations  in  the  same

series,  a  circular  movement  of  absolutely  identical  series  is  thus

demonstrated: the world as a circular movement that has already repeated

itself infinitely often and plays its game in infinitum.

  This conception is not simply a mechanistic conception; for if it were

that, it would not condition an infinite recurrence of identical cases, but a

final state. Because the world has not reached this, mechanistic theory must

be considered an imperfect and merely provisional hypothesis.

  1067 (1885)

  And do you know what "the world" is to me? Shall I show it to you in my

mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end; a

firm, iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does

not expend itself but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a

household  without  expenses  or  losses,  but  likewise  without  increase  or

income; enclosed by "nothingness" as by a boundary; not something blurry or

wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a

definite force, and not a sphere that might be "empty" here or there, but rather

as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time

one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of

forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding

back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flood of its

forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the

stillest, most rigid, coldest forms toward the hottest, most turbulent, most

self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple out of thisabundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still

affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as

that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no

disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating,

the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous

delight, my "beyond good and evil," without goal, unless the joy of the circle

is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself--do

you want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? A light for you,

too,  you  best-concealed,  strongest,  most  intrepid,  most  midnightly  men?--

This world is the will to power--and nothing besides! And you yourselves are

also this will to power--and nothing besides!



                      WE PHILOLOGISTS (POSTHUMOUS)

                        TRANSLATED BY J. M. KENNEDY

    (PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY)

                          TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION

  The subject of education was one to which Nietzsche, especially during

his residence in Basel, paid considerable attention, and his insight into it was

very much deeper than that of, say, Herbert Spencer or even Johann Friedrich

Herbart, the latter of whom has in late years exercised considerable influence

in scholastic circles. Nietzsche clearly saw that the "philologists" (using the

word chiefly in reference to the teachers of the classics in German colleges

and universities) were absolutely unfitted for their high task, since they were

one and all incapable of entering into the spirit of antiquity. Although at the

first reading, therefore, this book may seem to be rather fragmentary, there

are two main lines of thought running through it: an incisive criticism of

German professors, and a number of constructive ideas as to what classical

culture really should be.

  These scattered aphorisms, indeed, are significant as showing how far

Nietzsche  had  travelled  along  the  road  over  which  humanity  had  been

travelling from remote ages, and how greatly he was imbued with the pagan

spirit which he recognised in Goethe and valued in Burckhardt. Even at this

early period of his life Nietzsche was convinced that Christianity was the real

danger  to  culture;  and  not  merely  modern  Christianity,  but  also  the

Alexandrian culture, the last gasp of Greek antiquity, which had helped to

bring Christianity about. When, in the later aphorisms of "We Philologists,"Nietzsche appears to be throwing over the Greeks, it should be remembered

that he does not refer to the Greeks of the era of Homer or �schylus, or even

of Aristotle, but to the much later Greeks of the era of Longinus.

    Classical  antiquity,  however,  was  conveyed  to  the  public  through

university professors and their intellectual offspring, and these professors,

influenced  (quite  unconsciously,  of  course)  by  religious  and  "liberal"

principles, presented to their scholars a kind of emasculated antiquity. It was

only  on  these  conditions  that  the  State  allowed  the  pagan  teaching  to  be

propagated in the schools; and if, where classical scholars were concerned, it

was more tolerant than the Church had been, it must be borne in mind that the

Church had already done all the rough work of emasculating its enemies, and

had  handed  down  to  the  State  a  body  of  very  innocuous  and  harmless

investigators.  A  totally  erroneous  conception  of  what  constituted  classical

culture was thus brought about. Where any distinction was actually made, for

example, later Greek thought was enormously over-rated, and early Greek

thought equally undervalued. Aphorism 44, together with the first half-dozen

or so in the book, may be taken as typical specimens of Nietzsche's protest

against this state of things.

  It must be added, unfortunately, that Nietzsche's observations in this book

apply as much to England as to Germany. Classical teachers here may not be

rated so high as they are in Germany, but their influence would appear to be

equally powerful, and their theories of education and of classical antiquity

equally chaotic. In England as in Germany they are "theologians in disguise."

The danger of modern "values" to true culture may be readily gathered from a

perusal of aphorisms that follow: and, if these aphorisms enable even one

scholar in a hundred to enter more thoroughly into the spirit of a great past

they will not have been penned in vain.

    LONDON, July 1911.

                                  WE PHILOLOGISTS

  I

  To  what  a  great  extent  men  are  ruled  by  pure  hazard,  and  how  little

reason itself enters into the question, is sufficiently shown by observing how

few people have any real capacity for their professions and callings, and how

many square pegs there are in round holes: happy and well chosen instances

are  quite  exceptional,  like  happy  marriages,  and  even  these  latter  are  not

brought about by reason. A man chooses his calling before he is fitted toexercise his faculty of choice. He does not know the number of different

callings and professions that exist; he does not know himself; and then he

wastes his years of activity in this calling, applies all his mind to it, and

becomes experienced and practical. When, afterwards, his understanding has

become fully developed, it is generally too late to start something new; for

wisdom on earth has almost always had something of the weakness of old age

and lack of vigour about it.

  For the most part the task is to make good, and to set to rights as well as

possible,  that  which  was  bungled  in  the  beginning.  Many  will  come  to

recognise that the latter part of their life shows a purpose or design which has

sprung from a primary discord: it is hard to live through it. Towards the end

of his life, however, the average man has become accustomed to it--then he

may make a mistake in regard to the life he has lived, and praise his own

stupidity: bene navigavi cum naufragium feci . he may even compose a song

of thanksgiving to "Providence."

  2

  On inquiring into the origin of the philologist I find:

  1. A young man cannot have the slightest conception of what the Greeks

and Romans were.

  2. He does not know whether he is fitted to investigate into them;

  3. And, in particular, he does not know to what extent, in view of the

knowledge he may actually possess, he is fitted to be a teacher. What then

enables him to decide is not the knowledge of himself or his science; but

  (a) Imitation.

  (b) The convenience of carrying on the kind of work which he had begun

at school.

  (c) His intention of earning a living.

  In  short,  ninety-nine  philologists  out  of  a  hundred  should  not  be

philologists at all.

  3

  The more strict religions require that men shall look upon their activity

simply as one means of carrying out a metaphysical scheme: an unfortunate

choice of calling may then be explained as a test of the individual. Religions

keep their eyes fixed only upon the salvation of the individual . whether he is

a slave or a free man, a merchant or a scholar, his aim in life has nothing to

do with his calling, so that a wrong choice is not such a very great piece of

unhappiness. Let this serve as a crumb of comfort for philologists in general;but true philologists stand in need of a better understanding: what will result

from  a  science  which  is  "gone  in  for"  by  ninety-nine  such  people?  The

thoroughly unfitted majority draw up the rules of the science in accordance

with their own capacities and inclinations; and in this way they tyrannise over

the hundredth, the only capable one among them. If they have the training of

others in their hands they will train them consciously or unconsciously after

their own image . what then becomes of the classicism of the Greeks and

Romans?

  The points to be proved are--

  (a) The disparity between philologists and the ancients.

  (b) The inability of the philologist to train his pupils, even with the help

of the ancients.

  (c) The falsifying of the science by the (incapacity of the) majority, the

wrong requirements held in view; the renunciation of the real aim of this

science.

  4

  All  this  affects  the  sources  of  our  present  philology:  a  sceptical  and

melancholy attitude. But how otherwise are philologists to be produced?

  The imitation of antiquity: is not this a principle which has been refuted

by this time?

  The flight from actuality to the ancients: does not this tend to falsify our

conception of antiquity?

  5

  We are still behindhand in one type of contemplation: to understand how

the greatest productions of the intellect have a dreadful and evil background .

the sceptical type of contemplation. Greek antiquity is now investigated as

the most beautiful example of life.

  As man assumes a sceptical and melancholy attitude towards his life's

calling, so we must sceptically examine the highest life's calling of a nation:

in order that we may understand what life is.

  6

  My  words  of  consolation  apply  particularly  to  the  single  tyrannised

individual out of a hundred: such exceptional ones should simply treat all the

unenlightened majorities as their subordinates; and they should in the same

way take advantage of the prejudice, which is still widespread, in favour of

classical instruction--they need many helpers. But they must have a clear

perception of what their actual goal is.  7

    Philology as the science of antiquity does not, of course, endure for ever;

its elements are not inexhaustible. What cannot be exhausted, however, is the

ever-new adaptation of one's age to antiquity; the comparison of the two. If

we make it our task to understand our own age better by means of antiquity,

then our task will be an everlasting one.--This is the antinomy of philology:

people have always endeavoured to understand antiquity by means of the

present--and  shall  the  present  now  be  understood  by  means  of  antiquity?

Better:  people  have  explained  antiquity  to  themselves  out  of  their  own

experiences;  and  from  the  amount  of  antiquity  thus  acquired  they  have

assessed the value of their experiences. Experience, therefore, is certainly an

essential prerequisite for a philologist--that is, the philologist must first of all

be a man; for then only can he be productive as a philologist. It follows from

this that old men are well suited to be philologists if they were not such

during that portion of their life which was richest in experiences.

  It must be insisted, however, that it is only through a knowledge of the

present that one can acquire an inclination for the study of classical antiquity.

Where indeed should the impulse come from if not from this inclination?

When we observe how few philologists there actually are, except those that

have taken up philology as a means of livelihood, we can easily decide for

ourselves what is the matter with this impulse for antiquity: it hardly exists at

all, for there are no disinterested philologists.

  Our task then is to secure for philology the universally educative results

which it should bring about. The means: the limitation of the number of those

engaged in the philological profession (doubtful whether young men should

be made acquainted with philology at all). Criticism of the philologist. The

value of antiquity: it sinks with you: how deeply you must have sunk, since

its value is now so little!

  8

  It  is  a  great  advantage  for  the  true  philologist  that  a  great  deal  of

preliminary  work  has  been  done  in  his  science,  so  that  he  may  take

possession  of  this  inheritance  if  he  is  strong  enough  for  it--I  refer  to  the

valuation of the entire Hellenic mode of thinking. So long as philologists

worked  simply  at  details,  a  misunderstanding  of  the  Greeks  was  the

consequence. The stages of this undervaluation are � the sophists of the

second century, the philologist-poets of the Renaissance, and the philologist

as the teacher of the higher classes of society (Goethe, Schiller).  Valuing is the most difficult of all.

  In what respect is one most fitted for this valuing?

  --Not, at all events, when one is trained for philology as one is now. It

should be ascertained to what extent our present means make this last object

impossible.

  --Thus the philologist himself is not the aim of philology.

  9

  Most men show clearly enough that they do not regard themselves as

individuals: their lives indicate this. The Christian command that everyone

shall steadfastly keep his eyes fixed upon his salvation, and his alone, has as

its counterpart the general life of mankind, where every man lives merely as a

point among other points--living not only as the result of earlier generations,

but living also only with an eye to the future. There are only three forms of

existence  in  which  a  man  remains  an  individual  as  a  philosopher,  as  a

Saviour, and as an artist. But just let us consider how a scientific man bungles

his life: what has the teaching of Greek particles to do with the sense of life?-

-Thus we can also observe how innumerable men merely live, as it were, a

preparation for a man, the philologist, for example, as a preparation for the

philosopher,  who  in  his  turn  knows  how  to  utilise  his  ant-like  work  to

pronounce some opinion upon the value of life. When such ant-like work is

not carried out under any special direction the greater part of it is simply

nonsense, and quite superfluous.

  10

  Besides the large number of unqualified philologists there is, on the other

hand, a number of what may be called born philologists, who from some

reason or other are prevented from becoming such. The greatest obstacle,

however,  which  stands  in  the  way  of  these  born  philologists  is  the  bad

representation of philology by the unqualified philologists.

    Leopardi is the modern ideal of a philologist: The German philologists

can do nothing. (As a proof of this Voss should be studied!)

  11

  Let it be considered how differently a science is propagated from the way

in which any special talent in a family is transmitted. The bodily transmission

of an individual science is something very rare. Do the sons of philologists

easily become philologists? Dubito. Thus there is no such accumulation of

philological  capacity  as  there  was,  let  us  say,  in  Beethoven's  family  of

musical capacity. Most philologists begin from the beginning, and even thenthey learn from books, and not through travels, &c. They get some training,

of course.

  12

  Most  men  are  obviously  in  the  world  accidentally;  no  necessity  of  a

higher kind is seen in them. They work at this and that, their talents are

average. How strange! The manner in which they live shows that they think

very little of themselves: they merely esteem themselves in so far as they

waste their energy on trifles (whether these be mean or frivolous desires, or

the trashy concerns of their everyday calling). In the so-called life's calling,

which everyone must choose, we may perceive a touching modesty on the

part of mankind. They practically admit in choosing thus. "We are called

upon to serve and to be of advantage to our equals--the same remark applies

to our neighbour and to his neighbour, so everyone serves somebody else; no

one is carrying out the duties of his calling for his own sake, but always for

the sake of others and thus we are like geese which support one another by

the one leaning against the other. When the aim of each one of us is centred

in another, then we have all no object in existing; and this 'existing for others'

is the most comical of comedies."

  13

  Vanity is the involuntary inclination to set one's self up for an individual

while not really being one; that is to say, trying to appear independent when

one is dependent. The case of wisdom is the exact contrary: it appears to be

dependent while in reality it is independent.

  14

  The Hades of Homer--From what type of existence is it really copied? I

think it is the description of the philologist: it is better to be a day-labourer

than to have such an an�mic recollection of the past.--[1]

  15

  The  attitude  of  the  philologist  towards  antiquity  is  apologetic,  or  else

dictated by the view that what our own age values can likewise be found in

antiquity. The right attitude to take up, however, is the reverse one, viz., to

start with an insight into our modern topsyturviness, and to look back from

antiquity  to  it--and  many  things  about  antiquity  which  have  hitherto

displeased us will then be seen to have been most profound necessities.

  We  must  make  it  clear  to  ourselves  that  we  are  acting  in  an  absurd

manner when we try to defend or to beautify antiquity: who are we!

  16  We are under a false impression when we say that there is always some

caste  which  governs  a  nation's  culture,  and  that  therefore  savants  are

necessary; for savants only possess knowledge concerning culture (and even

this only in exceptional cases). Among learned men themselves there might

be a few, certainly not a caste, but even these would indeed be rare.

  17

  One very great value of antiquity consists in the fact that its writings are

the only ones which modern men still read carefully.

    Overstraining of the memory--very common among philologists, together

with a poor development of the judgment.

  18

    Busying ourselves with the culture-epochs of the past: is this gratitude?

We  should  look  backwards  in  order  to  explain  to  ourselves  the  present

conditions of culture: we do not become too laudatory in regard to our own

circumstances, but perhaps we should do so in order that we may not be too

severe on ourselves.

  19

  He  who  has  no  sense  for  the  symbolical  has  none  for  antiquity:  let

pedantic philologists bear this in mind.

  20

  My aim is to bring about a state of complete enmity between our present

"culture" and antiquity. Whoever wishes to serve the former must hate the

latter.

  21

  Careful meditation upon the past leads to the impression that we are a

multiplication of many pasts � so how can we be a final aim? But why not?

In  most  instances,  however,  we  do  not  wish  to  be  this.  We  take  up  our

positions again in the ranks, work in our own little corner, and hope that what

we do may be of some small profit to our successors. But that is exactly the

case of the cask of the Dan� � and this is useless, we must again set about

doing everything for ourselves, and only for ourselves--measuring science by

ourselves, for example with the question � What is science to us? not . what

are we to science? People really make life too easy for themselves when they

look upon themselves from such a simple historical point of view, and make

humble servants of themselves. "Your own salvation above everything"--that

is what you should say; and there are no institutions which you should prize

more  highly  than  your  own  soul.--Now,  however,  man  learns  to  knowhimself: he finds himself miserable, despises himself, and is pleased to find

something  worthy  of  respect  outside  himself.  Therefore  he  gets  rid  of

himself, so to speak, makes himself subservient to a cause, does his duty

strictly, and atones for his existence. He knows that he does not work for

himself alone; he wishes to help those who are daring enough to exist on

account of themselves, like Socrates. The majority of men are as it were

suspended in the air like toy balloons; every breath of wind moves them.--As

a consequence the savant must be such out of self-knowledge, that is to say,

out of contempt for himself--in other words he must recognise himself to be

merely the servant of some higher being who comes after him. Otherwise he

is simply a sheep.

  22

  It is the duty of the free man to live for his own sake, and not for others. It

was on this account that the Greeks looked upon handicrafts as unseemly.

  As a complete entity Greek antiquity has not yet been fully valued � I

am  convinced  that  if  it  had  not  been  surrounded  by  its  traditional

glorification, the men of the present day would shrink from it horror stricken.

This glorification, then, is spurious; gold-paper.

  23

  The false enthusiasm for antiquity in which many philologists live. When

antiquity  suddenly  comes  upon  us  in  our  youth,  it  appears  to  us  to  be

composed of innumerable trivialities; in particular we believe ourselves to be

above its ethics. And Homer and Walter Scott--who carries off the palm? Let

us be honest! If this enthusiasm were really felt, people could scarcely seek

their life's calling in it. I mean that what we can obtain from the Greeks only

begins to dawn upon us in later years: only after we have undergone many

experiences, and thought a great deal.

  24

  People in general think that philology is at an end--while I believe that it

has not yet begun.

  The  greatest  events  in  philology  are  the  appearance  of  Goethe,

Schopenhauer, and Wagner; standing on their shoulders we look far into the

distance. The fifth and sixth centuries have still to be discovered.

  25

  Where do we see the effect of antiquity? Not in language, not in the

imitation of something or other, and not in perversity and waywardness, to

which uses the French have turned it. Our museums are gradually becomingfilled up: I always experience a sensation of disgust when I see naked statues

in  the  Greek  style  in  the  presence  of  this  thoughtless  philistinism  which

would fain devour everything.

            PLANS AND THOUGHTS RELATING TO A WORK ON

                                      PHILOLOGY

  (1875)

  26

  Of all sciences philology at present is the most favoured � its progress

having been furthered for centuries by the greatest number of scholars in

every nation who have had charge of the noblest pupils. Philology has thus

had one of the best of all opportunities to be propagated from generation to

generation, and to make itself respected. How has it acquired this power?

    Calculations of the different prejudices in its favour.

  How then if these were to be frankly recognised as prejudices? Would not

philology be superfluous if we reckoned up the interests of a position in life

or the earning of a livelihood? What if the truth were told about antiquity, and

its qualifications for training people to live in the present?

  In  order  that  the  questions  set  forth  above  may  be  answered  let  us

consider the training of the philologist, his genesis: he no longer comes into

being where these interests are lacking.

  If the world in general came to know what an unseasonable thing for us

antiquity really is, philologists would no longer be called in as the educators

of our youth.

  Effect  of  antiquity  on  the  non-philologist  likewise  nothing.  If  they

showed themselves to be imperative and contradictory, oh, with what hatred

would they be pursued! But they always humble themselves.

    Philology  now  derives  its  power  only  from  the  union  between  the

philologists who will not, or cannot, understand antiquity and public opinion,

which is misled by prejudices in regard to it.

  The real Greeks, and their "watering down" through the philologists.

  The  future  commanding  philologist  sceptical  in  regard  to  our  entire

culture, and therefore also the destroyer of philology as a profession.

                      THE PREFERENCE FOR ANTIQUITY

  27

  If a man approves of the investigation of the past he will also approve and

even praise the fact--and will above all easily understand it--that there are

scholars who are exclusively occupied with the investigation of Greek andRoman antiquity: but that these scholars are at the same time the teachers of

the children of the nobility and gentry is not equally easy of comprehension--

here lies a problem.

  Why philologists precisely? This is not altogether such a matter of course

as the case of a professor of medicine, who is also a practical physician and

surgeon.  For,  if  the  cases  were  identical,  preoccupation  with  Greek  and

Roman antiquity would be identical with the "science of education." In short,

the relationship between theory and practice in the philologist cannot be so

quickly conceived. Whence comes his pretension to be a teacher in the higher

sense, not only of all scientific men, but more especially of all cultured men?

This educational power must be taken by the philologist from antiquity; and

in such a case people will ask with astonishment: how does it come that we

attach such value to a far-off past that we can only become cultured men with

the aid of its knowledge?

  These questions, however, are not asked as a rule: The sway of philology

over our means of instruction remains practically unquestioned; and antiquity

has the importance assigned to it. To this extent the position of the philologist

is more favourable than that of any other follower of science. True, he has not

at his disposal that great mass of men who stand in need of him--the doctor,

for example, has far more than the philologist. But he can influence picked

men, or youths, to be more accurate, at a time when all their mental faculties

are beginning to blossom forth--people who can afford to devote both time

and money to their higher development. In all those places where European

culture has found its way, people have accepted secondary schools based

upon  a  foundation  of  Latin  and  Greek  as  the  first  and  highest  means  of

instruction.  In  this  way  philology  has  found  its  best  opportunity  of

transmitting itself, and commanding respect: no other science has been so

well favoured. As a general rule all those who have passed through such

institutions  have  afterwards  borne  testimony  to  the  excellence  of  their

organisation  and  curriculum,  and  such  people  are,  of  course,  unconscious

witnesses in favour of philology. If any who have not passed through these

institutions should happen to utter a word in disparagement of this education,

an unanimous and yet calm repudiation of the statement at once follows, as if

classical  education  were  a  kind  of  witchcraft,  blessing  its  followers,  and

demonstrating itself to them by this blessing. There is no attempt at polemics

� "We have been through it all." "We know it has done us good."

  Now there are so many things to which men have become so accustomedthat  they  look  upon  them  as  quite  appropriate  and  suitable,  for  habit

intermixes all things with sweetness; and men as a rule judge the value of a

thing in accordance with their own desires. The desire for classical antiquity

as it is now felt should be tested, and, as it were, taken to pieces and analysed

with a view to seeing how much of this desire is due to habit, and how much

to mere love of adventure--I refer to that inward and active desire, new and

strange, which gives rise to a productive conviction from day to day, the

desire for a higher goal, and also the means thereto � as the result of which

people advance step by step from one unfamiliar thing to another, like an

Alpine climber.

  What is the foundation on which the high value attached to antiquity at

the present time is based, to such an extent indeed that our whole modern

culture is founded on it? Where must we look for the origin of this delight in

antiquity, and the preference shown for it?

  I think I have recognised in my examination of the question that all our

philology--that is, all its present existence and power--is based on the same

foundation as that on which our view of antiquity as the most important of all

means of training is based. Philology as a means of instruction is the clear

expression of a predominating conception regarding the value of antiquity,

and the best methods of education. Two propositions are contained in this

statement. In the first place all higher education must be a historical one, and

secondly,  Greek  and  Roman  history  differs  from  all  others  in  that  it  is

classical. Thus the scholar who knows this history becomes a teacher. We are

not here going into the question as to whether higher education ought to be

historical or not; but we may examine the second and ask: in how far is it

classic?

  On this point there are many widespread prejudices. In the first place

there is the prejudice expressed in the synonymous concept, "The study of the

humanities": antiquity is classic because it is the school of the humane.

    Secondly: "Antiquity is classic because it is enlightened----"

  28

  It is the task of all education to change certain conscious actions and

habits into more or less unconscious ones; and the history of mankind is in

this  sense  its  education.  The  philologist  now  practises  unconsciously  a

number of such occupations and habits. It is my object to ascertain how his

power,  that  is,  his  instinctive  methods  of  work,  is  the  result  of  activities

which were formerly conscious, but which he has gradually come to feel assuch no longer: but that consciousness consisted of prejudices. The present

power of philologists is based upon these prejudices, for example the value

attached to the ratio as in the cases of Bentley and Hermann. Prejudices are,

as Lichtenberg says, the art impulses of men.

  29

  It is difficult to justify the preference for antiquity since it has arisen from

prejudices:

  1. From ignorance of all non-classical antiquity.

  2.  From  a  false  idealisation  of  humanitarianism,  whilst  Hindoos  and

Chinese are at all events more humane.

  3. From the pretensions of school-teachers.

  4. From the traditional admiration which emanated from antiquity itself.

  5.  From  opposition  to  the  Christian  church;  or  as  a  support  for  this

church.

  6.  From  the  impression  created  by  the  century-long  work  of  the

philologists, and the nature of this work. It must be a gold mine, thinks the

spectator.

  7. The acquirement of knowledge attained as the result of the study. The

preparatory school of science.

  In  short,  partly  from  ignorance,  wrong  impressions,  and  misleading

conclusions;  and  also  from  the  interest  which  philologists  have  in  raising

their science to a high level in the estimation of laymen.

  Also  the  preference  for  antiquity  on  the  part  of  the  artists,  who

involuntarily  assume  proportion  and  moderation  to  be  the  property  of  all

antiquity. Purity of form. Authors likewise.

  The  preference  for  antiquity  as  an  abbreviation  of  the  history  of  the

human race, as if there were an autochthonous creation here by which all

becoming might be studied.

  The  fact  actually  is  that  the  foundations  of  this  preference  are  being

removed one by one, and if this is not remarked by philologists themselves, it

is certainly being remarked as much as it can possibly be by people outside

their circle. First of all history had its effect, and then linguistics brought

about  the  greatest  diversion  among  philologists  themselves,  and  even  the

desertion of many of them. They have still the schools in their hands: but for

how long! In the form in which it has existed up to the present philology is

dying  out;  the  ground  has  been  swept  from  under  its  feet.  Whether

philologists may still hope to maintain their status is doubtful; in any casethey are a dying race.

  30

  The peculiarly significant situation of philologists: a class of people to

whom  we  entrust  our  youth,  and  who  have  to  investigate  quite  a  special

antiquity. The highest value is obviously attached to this antiquity. But if this

antiquity has been wrongly valued, then the whole foundation upon which the

high position of the philologist is based suddenly collapses. In any case this

antiquity  has  been  very  differently  valued,  and  our  appreciation  of  the

philologists has constantly been guided by it. These people have borrowed

their power from the strong prejudices in favour of antiquity,--this must be

made clear.

    Philologists now feel that when these prejudices are at last refuted, and

antiquity depicted in its true colours, the favourable prejudices towards them

will diminish considerably. It is thus to the interest of their profession not to

let a clear impression of antiquity come to light; in particular the impression

that antiquity in its highest sense renders one "out of season?" i.e., an enemy

to one's own time.

  It is also to the interest of philologists as a class not to let their calling as

teachers  be  regarded  from  a  higher  standpoint  than  that  to  which  they

themselves can correspond.

  31

  It is to be hoped that there are a few people who look upon it as a problem

why philologists should be the teachers of our noblest youths. Perhaps the

case will not be always so--It would be much more natural per se if our

children  were  instructed  in  the  elements  of  geography,  natural  science,

political  economy,  and  sociology,  if  they  were  gradually  led  to  a

consideration of life itself, and if finally, but much later, the most noteworthy

events of the past were brought to their knowledge. A knowledge of antiquity

should be among the last subjects which a student would take up; and would

not  this  position  of  antiquity  in  the  curriculum  of  a  school  be  more

honourable for it than the present one?--Antiquity is now used merely as a

prop�deutic for thinking, speaking, and writing; but there was a time when it

was the essence of earthly knowledge, and people at that time wished to

acquire by means of practical learning what they now seek to acquire merely

by means of a detailed plan of study--a plan which, corresponding to the

more advanced knowledge of the age, has entirely changed.

  Thus the inner purpose of philological teaching has been entirely altered;it was at one time material teaching, a teaching that taught how to live, but

now it is merely formal.[2]

  32

  If it were the task of the philologist to impart formal education, it would

be necessary for him to teach walking, dancing, speaking, singing, acting, or

arguing � and the so-called formal teachers did impart their instruction this

way in the second and third centuries. But only the training of a scientific

man is taken into account, which results in "formal" thinking and writing, and

hardly any speaking at all.

  33

  If the gymnasium is to train young men for science, people now say there

can  be  no  more  preliminary  preparation  for  any  particular  science,  so

comprehensive have all the sciences become. As a consequence teachers have

to  train  their  students  generally,  that  is  to  say  for  all  the  sciences--for

scientificality in other words; and for that classical studies are necessary!

What a wonderful jump! a most despairing justification! Whatever is, is right,

[3] even when it is clearly seen that the "right" on which it has been based has

turned to wrong.

  34

  It is accomplishments which are expected from us after a study of the

ancients: formerly, for example, the ability to write and speak. But what is

expected now! Thinking and deduction . but these things are not learnt from

the ancients, but at best through the ancients, by means of science. Moreover,

all historical deduction is very limited and unsafe, natural science should be

preferred.

  35

  It is the same with the simplicity of antiquity as it is with the simplicity of

style: it is the highest thing which we recognise and must imitate; but it is

also the last. Let it be remembered that the classic prose of the Greeks is also

a late result.

  36

  What a mockery of the study of the "humanities" lies in the fact that they

were also called "belles lettres" (bellas litteras)!

  37

  Wolf's[4]  reasons  why  the  Egyptians,  Hebrews,  Persians,  and  other

Oriental nations were not to be set on the same plane with the Greeks and

Romans:  "The  former  have  either  not  raised  themselves,  or  have  raisedthemselves only to a slight extent, above that type of culture which should be

called  a  mere  civilisation  and  bourgeois  acquirement,  as  opposed  to  the

higher and true culture of the mind." He then explains that this culture is

spiritual and literary: "In a well-organised nation this may be begun earlier

than  order  and  peacefulness  in  the  outward  life  of  the  people

(enlightenment)."

  He  then  contrasts  the  inhabitants  of  easternmost  Asia  ("like  such

individuals, who are not wanting in clean, decent, and comfortable dwellings,

clothing, and surroundings; but who never feel the necessity for a higher

enlightenment") with the Greeks ("in the case of the Greeks, even among the

most  educated  inhabitants  of  Attica,  the  contrary  often  happens  to  an

astonishing degree; and the people neglect as insignificant factors that which

we,  thanks  to  our  love  of  order,  are  in  the  habit  of  looking  upon  as  the

foundations of mental culture itself").

  38

  Our terminology already shows how prone we are to judge the ancients

wrongly: the exaggerated sense of literature, for example, or, as Wolf, when

speaking of the "inner history of ancient erudition," calls it, "the history of

learned enlightenment."

  39

    According  to  Goethe,  the  ancients  are  "the  despair  of  the  emulator."

Voltaire  said.  "If  the  admirers  of  Homer  were  honest,  they  would

acknowledge the boredom which their favourite often causes them."

  40

  The position we have taken up towards classical antiquity is at bottom the

profound cause of the sterility of modern culture; for we have taken all this

modern  conception  of  culture  from  the  Hellenised  Romans.  We  must

distinguish within the domain of antiquity itself: when we come to appreciate

its  purely  productive  period,  we  condemn  at  the  same  time  the  entire

Romano-Alexandrian culture. But at the same time also we condemn our own

attitude towards antiquity, and likewise our philology.

  41

  There has been an age-long battle between the Germans and antiquity,

i.e., a battle against the old culture. It is certain that precisely what is best and

deepest  in  the  German  resists  it.  The  main  point,  however,  is  that  such

resistance is only justifiable in the case of the Romanised culture; for this

culture, even at that time, was a falling-off from something more profoundand noble. It is this latter that the Germans are wrong in resisting.

  42

    Everything classic was thoroughly cultivated by Charles the Great, whilst

he  combated  everything  heathen  with  the  severest  possible  measures  of

coercion.  Ancient  mythology  was  developed,  but  German  mythology  was

treated as a crime. The feeling underlying all this, in my opinion, was that

Christianity had already overcome the old religion � people no longer feared

it,  but  availed  themselves  of  the  culture  that  rested  upon  it.  But  the  old

German gods were feared.

  A great superficiality in the conception of antiquity--little else than an

appreciation of its formal accomplishments and its knowledge--must thereby

have been brought about. We must find out the forces that stood in the way of

increasing our insight into antiquity. First of all, the culture of antiquity is

utilised as an incitement towards the acceptance of Christianity � it became,

as it were, the premium for conversion, the gilt with which the poisonous pill

was coated before being swallowed. Secondly, the help of ancient culture was

found  to  be  necessary  as  a  weapon  for  the  intellectual  protection  of

Christianity. Even the Reformation could not dispense with classical studies

for this purpose.

  The Renaissance, on the other hand, now begins, with a clearer sense of

classical studies, which, however, are likewise looked upon from an anti-

Christian standpoint: the Renaissance shows an awakening of honesty in the

south, like the Reformation in the north. They could not but clash; for a

sincere leaning towards antiquity renders one unchristian.

  On the whole, however, the Church succeeded in turning classical studies

into a harmless direction . the philologist was invented, representing a type of

learned man who was at the same time a priest or something similar. Even in

the period of the Reformation people succeeded in emasculating scholarship.

It is on this account that Friedrich August Wolf is noteworthy he freed his

profession from the bonds of theology. This action of his, however, was not

fully understood; for an aggressive, active element, such as was manifested

by the poet-philologists of the Renaissance, was not developed. The freedom

obtained benefited science, but not man.

  43

  It is true that both humanism and rationalism have brought antiquity into

the  field  as  an  ally;  and  it  is  therefore  quite  comprehensible  that  the

opponents  of  humanism  should  direct  their  attacks  against  antiquity  also.Antiquity, however, has been misunderstood and falsified by humanism � it

must  rather  be  considered  as  a  testimony  against  humanism,  against  the

benign nature of man, &c. The opponents of humanism are wrong to combat

antiquity as well; for in antiquity they have a strong ally.

  44

  It is so difficult to understand the ancients. We must wait patiently until

the spirit moves us. The human element which antiquity shows us must not

be  confused  with  humanitarianism.  This  contrast  must  be  strongly

emphasised:  philology  suffers  by  endeavouring  to  substitute  the

humanitarian, young men are brought forward as students of philology in

order that they may thereby become humanitarians. A good deal of history, in

my opinion, is quite sufficient for that purpose. The brutal and self-conscious

man will be humbled when he sees things and values changing to such an

extent.

  The  human  element  among  the  Greeks  lies  within  a  certain  naivete,

through which man himself is to be seen--state, art, society, military and civil

law,  sexual  relations,  education,  party.  It  is  precisely  the  human  element

which may be seen everywhere and among all peoples, but among the Greeks

it is seen in a state of nakedness and inhumanity which cannot be dispensed

with for purposes of instruction. In addition to this, the Greeks have created

the greatest number of individuals, and thus they give us so much insight into

men,--a Greek cook is more of a cook than any other.

  45

  I  deplore  a  system  of  education  which  does  not  enable  people  to

understand Wagner, and as the result of which Schopenhauer sounds harsh

and discordant in our ears . such a system of education has missed its aim.

  46

                THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE FIRST CHAPTER.

  Il faut dire la verite et s'immoler--VOLTAIRE.

  Let us suppose that there were freer and more superior spirits who were

dissatisfied with the education now in vogue, and that they summoned it to

their  tribunal,  what  would  the  defendant  say  to  them?  In  all  probability

something like this: "Whether you have a right to summon anyone here or

not, I am at all events not the proper person to be called. It is my educators to

whom you should apply. It is their duty to defend me, and I have a right to

keep silent. I am merely what they have made me."

  These educators would now be hauled before the tribunal, and amongthem  an  entire  profession  would  be  observed �  the  philologists.  This

profession consists in the first place of those men who make use of their

knowledge of Greek and Roman antiquity to bring up youths of thirteen to

twenty years of age, and secondly of those men whose task it is to train

specially-gifted  pupils  to  act  as  future  teachers--i.e.,  as  the  educators  of

educators. Philologists of the first type are teachers at the public schools,

those of the second are professors at the universities.

  The  first-named  philologists  are  entrusted  with  the  care  of  certain

specially-chosen youths, those who, early in life, show signs of talent and a

sense of what is noble, and whose parents are prepared to allow plenty of

time and money for their education. If other boys, who do not fulfil these

three conditions, are presented to the teachers, the teachers have the right to

refuse  them.  Those  forming  the  second  class,  the  university  professors,

receive the young men who feel themselves fitted for the highest and most

responsible of callings, that of teachers and moulders of mankind; and these

professors, too, may refuse to have anything to do with young men who are

not adequately equipped or gifted for the task.

  If,  then,  the  educational  system  of  a  period  is  condemned,  a  heavy

censure on philologists is thereby implied: either, as the consequence of their

wrong-headed view, they insist on giving bad education in the belief that it is

good; or they do not wish to give this bad education, but are unable to carry

the day in favour of education which they recognise to be better. In other

words, their fault is either due to their lack of insight or to their lack of will.

In answer to the first charge they would say that they knew no better, and in

answer  to  the  second  that  they  could  do  no  better.  As,  however,  these

philologists bring up their pupils chiefly with the aid of Greek and Roman

antiquity, their want of insight in the first case may be attributed to the fact

that they do not understand antiquity, and again to the fact that they bring

forward antiquity into the present age as if it were the most important of all

aids  to  instruction,  while  antiquity,  generally  speaking,  does  not  assist  in

training, or at all events no longer does so.

  On the other hand, if we reproach our professors with their lack of will,

they would be quite right in attributing educational significance and power to

antiquity; but they themselves could not be said to be the proper instruments

by means of which antiquity could exhibit such power. In other words, the

professors would not be real teachers and would be living under false colours,

but how, then, could they have reached such an irregular position? Through amisunderstanding of themselves and their qualifications. In order, then, that

we may ascribe to philologists their share in this bad educational system of

the present time, we may sum up the different factors of their innocence and

guilt in the following sentence: the philologist, if he wishes for a verdict of

acquittal,  must  understand  three  things  antiquity,  the  present  time,  and

himself �  his  fault  lies  in  the  fact  that  he  either  does  not  understand

antiquity, or the present time, or himself.

  47

  It is not true to say that we can attain culture through antiquity alone. We

may learn something from it, certainly; but not culture as the word is now

understood. Our present culture is based on an emasculated and mendacious

study of antiquity. In order to understand how ineffectual this study is, just

look at our philologists � they, trained upon antiquity, should be the most

cultured men. Are they?

  48

  Origin of the philologist. When a great work of art is exhibited there is

always some one who not only feels its influence but wishes to perpetuate it.

The same remark applies to a great state--to everything, in short, that man

produces. Philologists wish to perpetuate the influence of antiquity and they

can set about it only as imitative artists. Why not as men who form their lives

after antiquity?

  49

  The  decline  of  the  poet-scholars  is  due  in  great  part  to  their  own

corruption: their type is continually arising again; Goethe and Leopardi, for

example, belong to it. Behind them plod the philologist-savants. This type

has its origin in the sophisticism of the second century.

  50

  Ah, it is a sad story, the story of philology! The disgusting erudition, the

lazy, inactive passivity, the timid submission.--Who was ever free?

  51

  When we examine the history of philology it is borne in upon us how few

really  talented  men  have  taken  part  in  it.  Among  the  most  celebrated

philologists are a few who ruined their intellect by acquiring a smattering of

many subjects, and among the most enlightened of them were several who

could use their intellect only for childish tasks. It is a sad story � no science,

I think, has ever been so poor in talented followers. Those whom we might

call the intellectually crippled found a suitable hobby in all this hair-splitting.  52

  The teacher of reading and writing, and the reviser, were the first types of

the philologist.

  53

  Friedrich August Wolf reminds us how apprehensive and feeble were the

first  steps  taken  by  our  ancestors  in  moulding  scholarship--how  even  the

Latin classics, for example, had to be smuggled into the university market

under  all  sorts  of  pretexts,  as  if  they  had  been  contraband  goods.  In  the

"Gottingen Lexicon" of 1737, J. M. Gesner tells us of the Odes of Horace: "ut

imprimis, quid prodesse in severioribus studiis possint, ostendat."

  54

  I  was  pleased  to  read  of  Bentley  "non  tam  grande  pretium

emendatiunculis  meis  statuere  soleo,  ut  singularem  aliquam  gratiam  inde

sperem aut exigam."

  Newton  was  surprised  that  men  like  Bentley  and  Hare  should  quarrel

about  a  book  of  ancient  comedies,  since  they  were  both  theological

dignitaries.

  55

  Horace  was  summoned  by  Bentley  as  before  a  judgment  seat,  the

authority of which he would have been the first to repudiate. The admiration

which a discriminating man acquires as a philologist is in proportion to the

rarity of the discrimination to be found in philologists. Bentley's treatment of

Horace has something of the schoolmaster about it It would appear at first

sight as if Horace himself were not the object of discussion, but rather the

various scribes and commentators who have handed down the text: in reality,

however,  it  is  actually  Horace  who  is  being  dealt  with.  It  is  my  firm

conviction that to have written a single line which is deemed worthy of being

commented upon by scholars of a later time, far outweighs the merits of the

greatest  critic.  There  is  a  profound  modesty  about  philologists.  The

improving of texts is an entertaining piece of work for scholars, it is a kind of

riddle-solving; but it should not be looked upon as a very important task. It

would be an argument against antiquity if it should speak less clearly to us

because a million words stood in the way!

  56

  A school-teacher said to Bentley, "Sir, I will make your grandchild as

great a scholar as you are yourself." "How can you do that," replied Bentley,

"when I have forgotten more than you ever knew?"  57

  Bentley's clever daughter Joanna once lamented to her father that he had

devoted his time and talents to the criticism of the works of others instead of

writing something original. Bentley remained silent for some time as if he

were turning the matter over in his mind. At last he said that her remark was

quite right; he himself felt that he might have directed his gifts in some other

channel. Earlier in life, nevertheless, he had done something for the glory of

God and the improvement of his fellow-men (referring to his "Confutation of

Atheism"), but afterwards the genius of the pagans had attracted him, and,

despairing of attaining their level in any other way, he had mounted upon

their shoulders so that he might thus be able to look over their heads.

  58

    Bentley,  says  Wolf,  both  as  man  of  letters  and  individual,  was

misunderstood  and  persecuted  during  the  greater  part  of  his  life,  or  else

praised maliciously.

  Markland,  towards  the  end  of  his  life--as  was  the  case  with  so  many

others  like  him--became  imbued  with  a  repugnance  for  all  scholarly

reputation, to such an extent, indeed, that he partly tore up and partly burnt

several works which he had long had in hand.

  Wolf says: "The amount of intellectual food that can be got from well-

digested scholarship is a very insignificant item."

  In Winckelmann's youth there were no philological studies apart from the

ordinary bread-winning branches of the science--people read and explained

the ancients in order to prepare themselves for the better interpretation of the

Bible and the Corpus Juris.

  59

  In Wolf's estimation, a man has reached the highest point of historical

research when he is able to take a wide and general view of the whole and of

the  profoundly  conceived  distinctions  in  the  developments  in  art  and  the

different styles of art. Wolf acknowledges, however, that Winckelmann was

lacking in the more common talent of philological criticism, or else he could

not use it properly: "A rare mixture of a cool head and a minute and restless

solicitude  for  hundreds  of  things  which,  insignificant  in  themselves,  were

combined in his case with a fire that swallowed up those little things, and

with  a  gift  of  divination  which  is  a  vexation  and  an  annoyance  to  the

uninitiated."

  60  Wolf draws our attention to the fact that antiquity was acquainted only

with  theories  of  oratory  and  poetry  which  facilitated  production,  [Greek:

technai] and artes that formed real orators and poets, "while at the present day

we shall soon have theories upon which it would be as impossible to build up

a  speech  or  a  poem  as  it  would  be  to  form  a  thunderstorm  upon  a

brontological treatise."

  61

  Wolf's  judgment  on  the  amateurs  of  philological  knowledge  is

noteworthy:  "If  they  found  themselves  provided  by  nature  with  a  mind

corresponding to that of the ancients, or if they were capable of adapting

themselves to other points of view and other circumstances of life, then, with

even a nodding acquaintance with the best writers, they certainly acquired

more from those vigorous natures, those splendid examples of thinking and

acting, than most of those did who during their whole life merely offered

themselves to them as interpreters."

  62

  Says Wolf again � "In the end, only those few ought to attain really

complete  knowledge  who  are  born  with  artistic  talent  and  furnished  with

scholarship, and who make use of the best opportunities of securing, both

theoretically and practically, the necessary technical knowledge" True!

  63

  Instead of forming our students on the Latin models I recommend the

Greek,  especially  Demosthenes �  simplicity!  This  may  be  seen  by  a

reference to Leopardi, who is perhaps the greatest stylist of the century.

  64

    "Classical  education" �  what  do  people  see  in  it?  Something  that  is

useless  beyond  rendering  a  period  of  military  service  unnecessary  and

securing a degree![5]

  65

  When I observe how all countries are now promoting the advancement of

classical literature I say to myself, "How harmless it must be!" and then,

"How useful it must be!" It brings these countries the reputation of promoting

"free culture." In order that this "freedom" may be rightly estimated, just look

at the philologists!

  66

    Classical education! Yea, if there were only as much paganism as Goethe

found and glorified in Winckelmann, even that would not be much. Now,however, that the lying Christendom of our time has taken hold of it, the

thing becomes overpowering, and I cannot help expressing my disgust on the

point--People firmly believe in witchcraft where this "classical education" is

concerned. They, however, who possess the greatest knowledge of antiquity

should likewise possess the greatest amount of culture, viz., our philologists;

but what is classical about them?

  67

    Classical philology is the basis of the most shallow rationalism always

having been dishonestly applied, it has gradually become quite ineffective. Its

effect is one more illusion of the modern man. Philologists are nothing but a

guild of sky-pilots who are not known as such � this is why the State takes

an interest in them. The utility of classical education is completely used up,

whilst, for example, the history of Christianity still shows its power.

  68

  Philologists, when discussing their science, never get down to the root of

the  subject  .  they  never  set  forth  philology  itself  as  a  problem.  Bad

conscience? or merely thoughtlessness?

  69

  We learn nothing from what philologists say about philology: it is all

mere  tittle-tattle--for  example,  Jahn's[6]  "The  Meaning  and  Place  of  the

Study  of  Antiquity  in  Germany."  There  is  no  feeling  for  what  should  be

protected and defended: thus speak people who have not even thought of the

possibility that any one could attack them.

  70

    Philologists  are  people  who  exploit  the  vaguely-felt  dissatisfaction  of

modern man, and his desire for "something better," in order that they may

earn their bread and butter.

  I know them--I myself am one of them.

  71

  Our  philologists  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  true  educators  as  the

medicine-men of the wild Indians do to true physicians What astonishment

will be felt by a later age!

  72

  What they lack is a real taste for the strong and powerful characteristics

of the ancients. They turn into mere panegyrists, and thus become ridiculous.

  73

  They have forgotten how to address other men; and, as they cannot speakto the older people, they cannot do so to the young.

  74

  When we bring the Greeks to the knowledge of our young students, we

are treating the latter as if they were well-informed and matured men. What,

indeed, is there about the Greeks and their ways which is suitable for the

young? In the end we shall find that we can do nothing for them beyond

giving them isolated details. Are these observations for young people? What

we actually do, however, is to introduce our young scholars to the collective

wisdom  of  antiquity.  Or  do  we  not?  The  reading  of  the  ancients  is

emphasised in this way.

  My belief is that we are forced to concern ourselves with antiquity at a

wrong period of our lives. At the end of the twenties its meaning begins to

dawn on one.

  75

  There is something disrespectful about the way in which we make our

young students known to the ancients: what is worse, it is unpedagogical; or

what can result from a mere acquaintance with things which a youth cannot

consciously esteem! Perhaps he must learn to "believe" and this is why I

object to it.

  76

  There are matters regarding which antiquity instructs us, and about which

I should hardly care to express myself publicly.

  77

  All the difficulties of historical study to be elucidated by great examples.

  Why our young students are not suited to the Greeks.

  The  consequences  of  philology.  Arrogant  expectation.  Culture-

philistinism.  Superficiality.  Too  high  an  esteem  for  reading  and  writing.

Estrangement from the nation and its needs.

  The philologists themselves, the historians, philosophers, and jurists all

end in smoke.

  Our young students should be brought into contact with real sciences.

  Likewise with real art.

  In consequence, when they grew older, a desire for real history would be

shown.

  78

    Inhumanity: even in the "Antigone," even in Goethe's "Iphigenia."

  The want of "rationalism" in the Greeks.  Young people cannot understand the political affairs of antiquity.

  The poetic element: a bad expectation.

  79

  Do  the  philologists  know  the  present  time?  Their  judgments  on  it  as

Periclean, their mistaken judgments when they speak of Freytag's[7] genius

as resembling that of Homer, and so on; their following in the lead of the

litterateurs, their abandonment of the pagan sense, which was exactly the

classical element that Goethe discovered in Winckelmann.

  80

  The condition of the philologists may be seen by their indifference at the

appearance of Wagner. They should have learnt even more through him than

through Goethe, and they did not even glance in his direction. That shows

that they are not actuated by any strong need, or else they would have an

instinct to tell them where their food was to be found.

  81

  Wagner prizes his art too highly to go and sit in a corner with it, like

Schumann. He either surrenders himself to the public ("Rienzi") or he makes

the public surrender itself to him. He educates it up to his music. Minor

artists, too, want their public, but they try to get it by inartistic means, such as

through the Press, Hanslick,[8] &c.

  82

  Wagner perfected the inner fancy of man . later generations will see a

renaissance in sculpture. Poetry must precede the plastic art.

  83

  I observe in philologists �

  1. Want of respect for antiquity.

  2. Tenderness and flowery oratory; even an apologetic tone.

  3. Simplicity in their historical comments.

  4. Self-conceit.

  5. Under-estimation of the talented philologists.

  84

    Philologists appear to me to be a secret society who wish to train our

youth by means of the culture of antiquity � I could well understand this

society and their views being criticised from all sides. A great deal would

depend  upon  knowing  what  these  philologists  understood  by  the  term

"culture of antiquity"--If I saw, for example, that they were training their

pupils  against  German  philosophy  and  German  music,  I  should  either  setabout  combating  them  or  combating  the  culture  of  antiquity,  perhaps  the

former, by showing that these philologists had not understood the culture of

antiquity. Now I observe:

  1. A great indecision in the valuation of the culture of antiquity on the

part of philologists.

  2. Something very non-ancient in themselves; something non-free.

  3. Want of clearness in regard to the particular type of ancient culture

they mean.

  4. Want of judgment in their methods of instruction, e.g., scholarship.

  5. Classical education is served out mixed up with Christianity.

  85

  It is now no longer a matter of surprise to me that, with such teachers, the

education of our time should be worthless. I can never avoid depicting this

want of education in its true colours, especially in regard to those things

which ought to be learnt from antiquity if possible, for example, writing,

speaking, and so on.

  86

  The  transmission  of  the  emotions  is  hereditary:  let  that  be  recollected

when we observe the effect of the Greeks upon philologists.

  87

  Even  in  the  best  of  cases,  philologists  seek  for  no  more  than  mere

"rationalism" and Alexandrian culture--not Hellenism.

  88

  Very little can be gained by mere diligence, if the head is dull. Philologist

after philologist has swooped down on Homer in the mistaken belief that

something of him can be obtained by force. Antiquity speaks to us when it

feels a desire to do so, not when we do.

  89

  The inherited characteristic of our present-day philologists � a certain

sterility of insight has resulted, for they promote the science, but not the

philologist.

  90

  The following is one way of carrying on classical studies, and a frequent

one: a man throws himself thoughtlessly, or is thrown, into some special

branch or other, whence he looks to the right and left and sees a great deal

that is good and new. Then, in some unguarded moment, he asks himself:

"But what the devil has all this to do with me?" In the meantime he hasgrown old and has become accustomed to it all; and therefore he continues in

his rut--just as in the case of marriage.

  91

  In connection with the training of the modern philologist the influence of

the  science  of  linguistics  should  be  mentioned  and  judged;  a  philologist

should rather turn aside from it . the question of the early beginnings of the

Greeks and Romans should be nothing to him . how can they spoil their own

subject in such a way?

  92

  A  morbid  passion  often  makes  its  appearance  from  time  to  time  in

connection  with  the  oppressive  uncertainty  of  divination,  a  passion  for

believing  and  feeling  sure  at  all  costs:  for  example,  when  dealing  with

Aristotle, or in the discovery of magic numbers, which, in Lachmann's case,

is almost an illness.

  93

  The consistency which is prized in a savant is pedantry if applied to the

Greeks.

  94

  (THE GREEKS AND THE PHILOLOGISTS.)

  THE GREEKS render homage to beauty, develop the body, speak clearly,

are religious transfigurers , are listeners and observers, have an aptitude for

the  symbolical,  are  in  full  possession  of  their  freedom  as  men,  can  look

innocently out into the world, are the pessimists of thought.

  THE PHILOLOGISTS are babblers and triflers ugly-looking creatures,

stammerers  filthy  pedants,  of  everyday  occurrences  quibblers  and

scarecrows, unfitted for the symbolical, ardent slaves of the State, Christians

in disguise, philistines.

  Bergk's "History of Literature": Not a spark of Greek fire or Greek sense.

  96

  People  really  do  compare  our  own  age  with  that  of  Pericles,  and

congratulate themselves on the reawakening of the feeling of patriotism: I

remember a parody on the funeral oration of Pericles by G. Freytag,[9] in

which  this  prim  and  strait-laced  "poet"  depicted  the  happiness  now

experienced by sixty-year-old men.--All pure and simple caricature! So this is

the result! And sorrow and irony and seclusion are all that remain for him

who has seen more of antiquity than this.  97

  If we change a single word of Lord Bacon's we may say . infimarum

Gr�corum  virtutum  apud  philologos  laus  est,  mediarum  admiratio,

supremarum sensus nullus.

  98

  How can anyone glorify and venerate a whole people! It is the individuals

that count, even in the case of the Greeks.

  99

  There is a great deal of caricature even about the Greeks � for example,

the careful attention devoted by the Cynics to their own happiness.

  100

  The  only  thing  that  interests  me  is  the  relationship  of  the  people

considered as a whole to the training of the single individuals � and in the

case of the Greeks there are some factors which are very favourable to the

development of the individual. They do not, however, arise from the goodwill

of the people, but from the struggle between the evil instincts.

  By  means  of  happy  inventions  and  discoveries,  we  can  train  the

individual  differently  and  more  highly  than  has  yet  been  done  by  mere

chance and accident. There are still hopes . the breeding of superior men.

  101

  The Greeks are interesting and quite disproportionately important because

they had such a host of great individuals. How was that possible? This point

must be studied.

  102

  The history of Greece has hitherto always been written optimistically.

  103

  Selected points from antiquity: the power, fire, and swing of the feeling

the ancients had for music (through the first Pythian Ode), purity in their

historical sense, gratitude for the blessings of culture, the fire and corn feasts.

  The ennoblement of jealousy: the Greeks the most jealous nation.

    Suicide, hatred of old age, of penury. Empedocles on sexual love.

  104

  Nimble and healthy bodies, a clear and deep sense for the observation of

everyday  matters,  manly  freedom,  belief  in  good  racial  descent  and  good

upbringing, warlike virtues, jealousy in the [Greek: aristeyein], delight in the

arts, respect for leisure, a sense for free individuality, for the symbolical.

  105  The  spiritual  culture  of  Greece  an  aberration  of  the  amazing  political

impulse towards [Greek: aristeyein]. The [Greek: polis] utterly opposed to

new education; culture nevertheless existed.

  106

  When I say that, all things considered, the Greeks were more moral than

modern men what do I mean by that? From what we can perceive of the

activities of their soul, it is clear that they had no shame, they had no bad

conscience. They were more sincere, open-hearted, and passionate, as artists

are; they exhibited a kind of child-like naivete. It thus came about that even

in  all  their  evil  actions  they  had  a  dash  of  purity  about  them,  something

approaching the holy. A remarkable number of individualities: might there

not have been a higher morality in that? When we recollect that character

develops slowly, what can it be that, in the long run, breeds individuality?

Perhaps  vanity,  emulation?  Possibly.  Little  inclination  for  conventional

things.

  107

  The Greeks as the geniuses among the nations.

  Their childlike nature, credulousness.

    Passionate. Quite unconsciously they lived in such a way as to procreate

genius. Enemies of shyness and dulness. Pain. Injudicious actions. The nature

of  their  intuitive  insight  into  misery,  despite  their  bright  and  genial

temperament. Profoundness in their apprehension and glorifying of everyday

things (fire, agriculture). Mendacious, unhistorical. The significance of the

[Greek: polis] in culture instinctively recognised, favourable as a centre and

periphery for great men (the facility of surveying a community, and also the

possibility of addressing it as a whole). Individuality raised to the highest

power through the [Greek: polis]. Envy, jealousy, as among gifted people.

  108

  The  Greeks  were  lacking  in  sobriety  and  caution.  Over-sensibility,

abnormally  active  condition  of  the  brain  and  the  nerves;  impetuosity  and

fervour of the will.

  109

  "Invariably  to  see  the  general  in  the  particular  is  the  distinguishing

characteristic of genius," says Schopenhauer. Think of Pindar, &c.--"[Greek:

Sophrosynae]," according to Schopenhauer, has its roots in the clearness with

which the Greeks saw into themselves and into the world at large, and thence

became conscious of themselves.  The "wide separation of will and intellect" indicates the genius, and is

seen in the Greeks.

  "The melancholy associated with genius is due to the fact that the will to

live,  the  more  clearly  it  is  illuminated  by  the  contemplating  intellect,

appreciates  all  the  more  clearly  the  misery  of  its  condition,"  says

Schopenhauer. Cf. the Greeks.

  110

  The  moderation  of  the  Greeks  in  their  sensual  luxury,  eating,  and

drinking, and their pleasure therein; the Olympic plays and their worship .

that shows what they were.

  In the case of the genius, "the intellect will point out the faults which are

seldom absent in an instrument that is put to a use for which it was not

intended."

  "The will is often left in the lurch at an awkward moment: hence genius,

where real life is concerned, is more or less unpractical--its behaviour often

reminds us of madness."

  111

  We contrast the Romans, with their matter-of-fact earnestness, with the

genial  Greeks!  Schopenhauer:  "The  stern,  practical,  earnest  mode  of  life

which  the  Romans  called  gravitas  presupposes  that  the  intellect  does  not

forsake the service of the will in order to roam far off among things that have

no connection with the will."

  112

  It would have been much better if the Greeks had been conquered by the

Persians instead of by the Romans.

  113

  The characteristics of the gifted man who is lacking in genius are to be

found  in  the  average  Hellene--all  the  dangerous  characteristics  of  such  a

disposition and character.

  114

  Genius makes tributaries of all partly-talented people: hence the Persians

themselves sent their ambassadors to the Greek oracles.

  115

  The happiest lot that can fall to the genius is to exchange doing and acting

for  leisure;  and  this  was  something  the  Greeks  knew  how  to  value.  The

blessings of labour! Nugari was the Roman name for all the exertions and

aspirations of the Greeks.  No happy course of life is open to the genius, he stands in contradiction to

his  age  and  must  perforce  struggle  with  it.  Thus  the  Greeks  .  they

instinctively made the utmost exertions to secure a safe refuge for themselves

(in  the  polis).  Finally,  everything  went  to  pieces  in  politics.  They  were

compelled to take up a stand against their enemies . this became ever more

and more difficult, and at last impossible.

  116

  Greek culture is based on the lordship of a small class over four to nine

times their number of slaves. Judged by mere numbers, Greece was a country

inhabited by barbarians. How can the ancients be thought to be humane?

There was a great contrast between the genius and the breadwinner, the half-

beast of burden. The Greeks believed in a racial distinction. Schopenhauer

wonders  why  Nature  did  not  take  it  into  her  head  to  invent  two  entirely

separate species of men.

  The Greeks bear the same relation to the barbarians "as free-moving or

winged animals do to the barnacles which cling tightly to the rocks and must

await what fate chooses to send them"--Schopenhauer's simile.

  117

  The Greeks as the only people of genius in the history of the world. Such

they are even when considered as learners; for they understand this best of

all, and can do more than merely trim and adorn themselves with what they

have borrowed, as did the Romans.

  The constitution of the polis is a Phoenician invention, even this has been

imitated by the Hellenes. For a long time they dabbled in everything, like

joyful dilettanti. Aphrodite is likewise Phoenician. Neither do they disavow

what has come to them through immigration and does not originally belong

to their own country.

  118

  The  happy  and  comfortable  constitution  of  the  politico-social  position

must not be sought among the Greeks . that is a goal which dazzles the eyes

of our dreamers of the future! It was, on the contrary, dreadful; for this is a

matter that must be judged according to the following standard: the more

spirit,  the  more  suffering  (as  the  Greeks  themselves  prove).  Whence  it

follows, the more stupidity, the more comfort. The philistine of culture is the

most comfortable creature the sun has ever shone upon: and he is doubtless

also in possession of the corresponding stupidity.

  119  The Greek polis and the [Greek: aien aristeyein] grew up out of mutual

enmity.  Hellenic  and  philanthropic  are  contrary  adjectives,  although  the

ancients flattered themselves sufficiently.

  Homer is, in the world of the Hellenic discord, the pan-Hellenic Greek.

The [Greek: "agon"] of the Greeks is also manifested in the Symposium in

the shape of witty conversation.

  120

  Wanton, mutual annihilation inevitable: so long as a single polis wished

to exist--its envy for everything superior to itself, its cupidity, the disorder of

its customs, the enslavement of the women, lack of conscience in the keeping

of oaths, in murder, and in cases of violent death.

  Tremendous power of self-control: for example in a man like Socrates,

who was capable of everything evil.

  121

  Its  noble  sense  of  order  and  systematic  arrangement  had  rendered  the

Athenian state immortal--The ten strategists in Athens! Foolish! Too big a

sacrifice on the altar of jealousy.

  122

  The recreations of the Spartans consisted of feasting, hunting, and making

war � their every-day life was too hard. On the whole, however, their state is

merely a caricature of the polls, a corruption of Hellas. The breeding of the

complete  Spartan--but  what  was  there  great  about  him  that  his  breeding

should have required such a brutal state!

  123

  The political defeat of Greece is the greatest failure of culture; for it has

given rise to the atrocious theory that culture cannot be pursued unless one is

at the same time armed to the teeth. The rise of Christianity was the second

greatest failure: brute force on the one hand, and a dull intellect on the other,

won a complete victory over the aristocratic genius among the nations. To be

a Philhellenist now means to be a foe of brute force and stupid intellects.

Sparta was the ruin of Athens in so far as she compelled Athens to turn her

entire attention to politics and to act as a federal combination.

  124

  There  are  domains  of  thought  where  the  ratio  will  only  give  rise  to

disorder, and the philologist, who possesses nothing more, is lost through it

and is unable to see the truth � e.g. in the consideration of Greek mythology.

A merely fantastic person, of course, has no claim either � one must possessGreek imagination and also a certain amount of Greek piety. Even the poet

does not require to be too consistent, and consistency is the last thing Greeks

would understand.

  125

    Almost all the Greek divinities are accumulations of divinities . we find

one layer over another, soon to be hidden and smoothed down by yet a third,

and  so  on.  It  scarcely  seems  to  me  to  be  possible  to  pick  these  various

divinities to pieces in a scientific manner, for no good method of doing so can

be recommended: even the poor conclusion by analogy is in this instance a

very good conclusion.

  126

  At what a distance must one be from the Greeks to ascribe to them such a

stupidly narrow autochthony as does Ottfried Muller![10] How Christian it is

to assume, with Welcker,[11] that the Greeks were originally monotheistic!

How philologists torment themselves by investigating the question whether

Homer actually wrote, without being able to grasp the far higher tenet that

Greek art long exhibited an inward enmity against writing, and did not wish

to be read at all.

  127

  In  the  religious  cultus  an  earlier  degree  of  culture  comes  to  light  a

remnant of former times. The ages that celebrate it are not those which invent

it, the contrary is often the case. There are many contrasts to be found here.

The Greek cultus takes us back to a pre-Homeric disposition and culture. It is

almost the oldest that we know of the Greeks--older than their mythology,

which their poets have considerably remoulded, so far as we know it--Can

this cult really be called Greek? I doubt it: they are finishers, not inventors.

They preserve by means of this beautiful completion and adornment.

  128

  It  is  exceedingly  doubtful  whether  we  should  draw  any  conclusion  in

regard to nationality and relationship with other nations from languages. A

victorious  language  is  nothing  but  a  frequent  (and  not  always  regular)

indication  of  a  successful  campaign.  Where  could  there  have  been

autochthonous peoples! It shows a very hazy conception of things to talk

about Greeks who never lived in Greece. That which is really Greek is much

less the result of natural aptitude than of adapted institutions, and also of an

acquired language.

  129  To live on mountains, to travel a great deal, and to move quickly from

one place to another . in these ways we can now begin to compare ourselves

with the Greek gods. We know the past, too, and we almost know the future.

What would a Greek say, if only he could see us!

  130

  The gods make men still more evil; this is the nature of man. If we do not

like a man, we wish that he may become worse than he is, and then we are

glad. This forms part of the obscure philosophy of hate--a philosophy which

has never yet been written, because it is everywhere the pudendum that every

one feels.

  131

  The pan-Hellenic Homer finds his delight in the frivolity of the gods; but

it  is  astounding  how  he  can  also  give  them  dignity  again.  This  amazing

ability to raise one's self again, however, is Greek.

  132

  What, then, is the origin of the envy of the gods? people did not believe in

a calm, quiet happiness, but only in an exuberant one. This must have caused

some displeasure to the Greeks; for their soul was only too easily wounded: it

embittered them to see a happy man. That is Greek. If a man of distinguished

talent appeared, the flock of envious people must have become astonishingly

large. If any one met with a misfortune, they would say of him: "Ah! no

wonder! he was too frivolous and too well off." And every one of them would

have behaved exuberantly if he had possessed the requisite talent, and would

willingly have played the role of the god who sent the unhappiness to men.

  133

  The Greek gods did not demand any complete changes of character, and

were, generally speaking, by no means burdensome or importunate . it was

thus possible to take them seriously and to believe in them. At the time of

Homer, indeed, the nature of the Greek was formed � flippancy of images

and  imagination  was  necessary  to  lighten  the  weight  of  its  passionate

disposition and to set it free.

  134

  Every  religion  has  for  its  highest  images  an  analogon  in  the  spiritual

condition of those who profess it. The God of Mohammed . the solitariness of

the desert, the distant roar of the lion, the vision of a formidable warrior. The

God of the Christians . everything that men and women think of when they

hear the word "love". The God of the Greeks: a beautiful apparition in adream.

  135

  A great deal of intelligence must have gone to the making up of a Greek

polytheism . the expenditure of intelligence is much less lavish when people

have only one God.

  136

  Greek morality is not based on religion, but on the polis.

  There were only priests of the individual gods; not representatives of the

whole religion . i.e., no guild of priests. Likewise no Holy Writ.

  137

  The "lighthearted" gods � this is the highest adornment which has ever

been bestowed upon the world--with the feeling, How difficult it is to live!

  138

  If the Greeks let their "reason" speak, their life seems to them bitter and

terrible. They are not deceived. But they play round life with lies: Simonides

advises them to treat life as they would a play; earnestness was only too well

known to them in the form of pain. The misery of men is a pleasure to the

gods when they hear the poets singing of it. Well did the Greeks know that

only through art could even misery itself become a source of pleasure, vide

tragoediam.

  139

  It  is  quite  untrue  to  say  that  the  Greeks  only  took  this  life  into  their

consideration--they suffered also from thoughts of death and Hell. But no

"repentance" or contrition.

  140

  The incarnate appearance of gods, as in Sappho's invocation to Aphrodite,

must not be taken as poetic licence � they are frequently hallucinations. We

conceive of a great many things, including the will to die, too superficially as

rhetorical.

  141

  The "martyr" is Hellenic: Prometheus, Hercules. The hero-myth became

pan-Hellenic: a poet must have had a hand in that!

  142

  How realistic the Greeks were even in the domain of pure inventions!

They poetised reality, not yearning to lift themselves out of it. The raising of

the present into the colossal and eternal, e.g., by Pindar.

  143  What condition do the Greeks premise as the model of their life in Hades?

An�mic,  dreamlike,  weak  .  it  is  the  continuous  accentuation  of  old  age,

when the memory gradually becomes weaker and weaker, and the body still

more so. The senility of senility . this would be our state of life in the eyes of

the Hellenes.

  144

  The naive character of the Greeks observed by the Egyptians.

  145

  The truly scientific people, the literary people, were the Egyptians and not

the Greeks. That which has the appearance of science among the Greeks,

originated among the Egyptians and later on returned to them to mingle again

with the old current. Alexandrian culture is an amalgamation of Hellenic and

Egyptian . and when our world again founds its culture upon the Alexandrian

culture, then....[12]

  146

  The  Egyptians  are  far  more  of  a  literary  people  than  the  Greeks.  I

maintain this against Wolf. The first grain in Eleusis, the first vine in Thebes,

the first olive-tree and fig-tree. The Egyptians had lost a great part of their

mythology.

  147

  The unmathematical undulation of the column in Paestum is analogous to

the modification of the tempo: animation in place of a mechanical movement.

  148

  The desire to find something certain and fixed in �sthetic led to the

worship of Aristotle: I think, however, that we may gradually come to see

from his works that he understood nothing about art, and that it is merely the

intellectual conversations of the Athenians, echoing in his pages, which we

admire.

  149

  In Socrates we have as it were lying open before us a specimen of the

consciousness  out  of  which,  later  on,  the  instincts  of  the  theoretic  man

originated: that one would rather die than grow old and weak in mind.

  150

  At the twilight of antiquity there were still wholly unchristian figures,

which  were  more  beautiful,  harmonious,  and  pure  than  those  of  any

Christians:  e.g.,  Proclus.  His  mysticism  and  syncretism  were  things  that

precisely Christianity cannot reproach him with. In any case, it would be mydesire  to  live  together  with  such  people.  In  comparison  with  them

Christianity looks like some crude brutalisation, organised for the benefit of

the mob and the criminal classes.

    Proclus, who solemnly invokes the rising moon.

  151

  With  the  advent  of  Christianity  a  religion  attained  the  mastery  which

corresponded to a pre-Greek condition of mankind: belief in witchcraft in

connection with all and everything, bloody sacrifices, superstitious fear of

demoniacal  punishments,  despair  in  one's  self,  ecstatic  brooding  and

hallucination, man's self become the arena of good and evil spirits and their

struggles.

  152

  All  branches  of  history  have  experimented  with  antiquity �  critical

consideration  alone  remains.  By  this  term  I  do  not  mean  conjectural  and

literary-historical criticism.

  153

  Antiquity has been treated by all kinds of historians and their methods.

We  have  now  had  enough  experience,  however,  to  turn  the  history  of

antiquity to account without being shipwrecked on antiquity itself.

  154

  We can now look back over a fairly long period of human existence �

what will the humanity be like which is able to look back at us from an

equally long distance? which finds us lying intoxicated among the debris of

old culture! which finds its only consolation in "being good" and in holding

out the "helping hand," and turns away from all other consolations!--Does

beauty, too, grow out of the ancient culture? I think that our ugliness arises

from our metaphysical remnants . our confused morals, the worthlessness of

our  marriages,  and  so  on,  are  the  cause.  The  beautiful  man,  the  healthy,

moderate, and enterprising man, moulds the objects around him into beautiful

shapes after his own image.

  155

  Up to the present time all history has been written from the standpoint of

success, and, indeed, with the assumption of a certain reason in this success.

This remark applies also to Greek history: so far we do not possess any. It is

the same all round, however: where are the historians who can survey things

and events without being humbugged by stupid theories? I know of only one,

Burckhardt. Everywhere the widest possible optimism prevails in science.The question: "What would have been the consequence if so and so had not

happened?"  is  almost  unanimously  thrust  aside,  and  yet  it  is  the  cardinal

question. Thus everything becomes ironical. Let us only consider our own

lives. If we examine history in accordance with a preconceived plan, let this

plan be sought in the purposes of a great man, or perhaps in those of a sex, or

of a party. Everything else is a chaos.--Even in natural science we find this

deification of the necessary.

    Germany  has  become  the  breeding-place  of  this  historical  optimism;

Hegel is perhaps to blame for this. Nothing, however, is more responsible for

the fatal influence of German culture. Everything that has been kept down by

success gradually rears itself up: history as the scorn of the conqueror; a

servile sentiment and a kneeling down before the actual fact--"a sense for the

State," they now call it, as if that had still to be propagated! He who does not

understand how brutal and unintelligent history is will never understand the

stimulus to make it intelligent. Just think how rare it is to find a man with as

great an intelligent knowledge of his own life as Goethe had . what amount of

rationality can we expect to find arising out of these other veiled and blind

existences as they work chaotically with and in opposition to each other?

  And  it  is  especially  naive  when  Hellwald,  the  author  of  a  history  of

culture, warns us away from all "ideals," simply because history has killed

them off one after the other.

  156

  To bring to light without reserve the stupidity and the want of reason in

human things � that is the aim of our brethren and colleagues. People will

then have to distinguish what is essential in them, what is incorrigible, and

what is still susceptible of further improvement. But "Providence" must be

kept out of the question, for it is a conception that enables people to take

things too easily. I wish to breathe the breath of this purpose into science. Let

us advance our knowledge of mankind! The good and rational in man is

accidental or apparent, or the contrary of something very irrational. There

will come a time when training will be the only thought.

  157

  Surrender to necessity is exactly what I do not teach--for one must first

know this necessity to be necessary. There may perhaps be many necessities;

but in general this inclination is simply a bed of idleness.

  158

  To know history now means � to recognise how all those who believedin a Providence took things too easily. There is no such thing. If human

affairs are seen to go forward in a loose and disordered way, do not think that

a god has any purpose in view by letting them do so or that he is neglecting

them. We can now see in a general way that the history of Christianity on

earth has been one of the most dreadful chapters in history, and that a stop

must  be  put  to  it.  True,  the  influence  of  antiquity  has  been  observed  in

Christianity  even  in  our  own  time,  and,  as  it  diminishes,  so  will  our

knowledge of antiquity diminish also to an even greater extent. Now is the

best  time  to  recognise  it:  we  are  no  longer  prejudiced  in  favour  of

Christianity, but we still understand it, and also the antiquity that forms part

of it, so far as this antiquity stands in line with Christianity.

  159

    Philosophic heads must occupy themselves one day with the collective

account of antiquity and make up its balance-sheet. If we have this, antiquity

will be overcome. All the shortcomings which now vex us have their roots in

antiquity, so that we cannot continue to treat this account with the mildness

which has been customary up to the present. The atrocious crime of mankind

which rendered Christianity possible, as it actually became possible, is the

guilt of antiquity. With Christianity antiquity will also be cleared away.--At

the present time it is not so very far behind us, and it is certainly not possible

to do justice to it. It has been availed of in the most dreadful fashion for

purposes of repression, and has acted as a support for religious oppression by

disguising itself as "culture." It was common to hear the saying, "Antiquity

has been conquered by Christianity."

  This was a historical fact, and it was thus thought that no harm could

come of any dealings with antiquity. Yes, it is so plausible to say that we find

Christian ethics "deeper" than Socrates! Plato was easier to compete with!

We are at the present time, so to speak, merely chewing the cud of the very

battle which was fought in the first centuries of the Christian era--with the

exception of the fact that now, instead of the clearly perceptible antiquity

which  then  existed,  we  have  merely  its  pale  ghost;  and,  indeed,  even

Christianity itself has become rather ghostlike. It is a battle fought after the

decisive battle, a post-vibration. In the end, all the forces of which antiquity

consisted have reappeared in Christianity in the crudest possible form: it is

nothing new, only quantitatively extraordinary.

  160

  What severs us for ever from the culture of antiquity is the fact that itsfoundations have become too shaky for us. A criticism of the Greeks is at the

same time a criticism of Christianity; for the bases of the spirit of belief, the

religious  cult,  and  witchcraft,  are  the  same  in  both--There  are  many

rudimentary stages still remaining, but they are by this time almost ready to

collapse.

  This would be a task . to characterise Greek antiquity as irretrievably lost,

and  with  it  Christianity  also  and  the  foundations  upon  which,  up  to  the

present time, our society and politics have been based.

  161

    Christianity has conquered antiquity--yes; that is easily said. In the first

place, it is itself a piece of antiquity, in the second place, it has preserved

antiquity, in the third place, it has never been in combat with the pure ages of

antiquity. Or rather: in order that Christianity itself might remain, it had to let

itself be overcome by the spirit of antiquity--for example, the idea of empire,

the community, and so forth. We are suffering from the uncommon want of

clearness and uncleanliness of human things; from the ingenious mendacity

which Christianity has brought among men.

  162

  It  is  almost  laughable  to  see  how  nearly  all  the  sciences  and  arts  of

modern times grow from the scattered seeds which have been wafted towards

us from antiquity, and how Christianity seems to us here to be merely the evil

chill of a long night, a night during which one is almost inclined to believe

that all is over with reason and honesty among men. The battle waged against

the natural man has given rise to the unnatural man.

  163

  With the dissolution of Christianity a great part of antiquity has become

incomprehensible to us, for instance, the entire religious basis of life. On this

account an imitation of antiquity is a false tendency . the betrayers or the

betrayed are the philologists who still think of such a thing. We live in a

period when many different conceptions of life are to be found: hence the

present age is instructive to an unusual degree; and hence also the reason why

it is so ill, since it suffers from the evils of all its tendencies at once. The man

of the future . the European man.

  164

  The German Reformation widened the gap between us and antiquity: was

it  necessary  for  it  to  do  so?  It  once  again  introduced  the  old  contrast  of

"Paganism" and "Christianity"; and it was at the same time a protest againstthe decorative culture of the Renaissance--it was a victory gained over the

same culture as had formerly been conquered by early Christianity.

  In regard to "worldly things," Christianity preserved the grosser views of

the ancients. All the nobler elements in marriage, slavery, and the State are

unchristian. It required the distorting characteristics of worldliness to prove

itself.

  165

  The  connection  between  humanism  and  religious  rationalism  was

emphasised  as  a  Saxonian  trait  by  Kochly:  the  type  of  this  philologist  is

Gottfried Hermann.[13]

  166

  I  understand  religions  as  narcotics:  but  when  they  are  given  to  such

nations as the Germans, I think they are simply rank poison.

  167

  All religions are, in the end, based upon certain physical assumptions,

which are already in existence and adapt the religions to their needs . for

example, in Christianity, the contrast between body and soul, the unlimited

importance of the earth as the "world," the marvellous occurrences in nature.

If  once  the  opposite  views  gain  the  mastery--for  instance,  a  strict  law  of

nature, the helplessness and superfluousness of all gods, the strict conception

of the soul as a bodily process--all is over. But all Greek culture is based

upon such views.

  168

  When we look from the character and culture of the Catholic Middle

Ages  back  to  the  Greeks,  we  see  them  resplendent  indeed  in  the  rays  of

higher humanity; for, if we have anything to reproach these Greeks with, we

must reproach the Middle Ages with it also to a much greater extent. The

worship of the ancients at the time of the Renaissance was therefore quite

honest and proper. We have carried matters further in one particular point,

precisely in connection with that dawning ray of light. We have outstripped

the Greeks in the clarifying of the world by our studies of nature and men.

Our knowledge is much greater, and our judgments are more moderate and

just.

  In addition to this, a more gentle spirit has become widespread, thanks to

the period of illumination which has weakened mankind--but this weakness,

when turned into morality, leads to good results and honours us. Man has

now a great deal of freedom: it is his own fault if he does not make more useof  it  than  he  does;  the  fanaticism  of  opinions  has  become  much  milder.

Finally, that we would much rather live in the present age than in any other is

due to science, and certainly no other race in the history of mankind has had

such a wide choice of noble enjoyments as ours--even if our race has not the

palate  and  stomach  to  experience  a  great  deal  of  joy.  But  one  can  live

comfortably amid all this "freedom" only when one merely understands it and

does not wish to participate in it--that is the modern crux. The participants

appear to be less attractive than ever � how stupid they must be!

  Thus the danger arises that knowledge may avenge itself on us, just as

ignorance avenged itself on us during the Middle Ages. It is all over with

those religions which place their trust in gods, Providences, rational orders of

the universe, miracles, and sacraments, as is also the case with certain types

of holy lives, such as ascetics; for we only too easily conclude that such

people are the effects of sickness and an aberrant brain. There is no doubt that

the contrast between a pure, incorporeal soul and a body has been almost set

aside.  Who  now  believes  in  the  immortality  of  the  soul!  Everything

connected  with  blessedness  or  damnation,  which  was  based  upon  certain

erroneous physiological assumptions, falls to the ground as soon as these

assumptions are recognised to be errors. Our scientific assumptions admit just

as  much  of  an  interpretation  and  utilisation  in  favour  of  a  besotting

philistinism--yea, in favour of bestiality--as also in favour of "blessedness"

and  soul-inspiration.  As  compared  with  all  previous  ages,  we  are  now

standing on a new foundation, so that something may still be expected from

the human race.

  As  regards  culture,  we  have  hitherto  been  acquainted  with  only  one

complete form of it, i.e., the city-culture of the Greeks, based as it was on

their mythical and social foundations; and one incomplete form, the Roman,

which acted as an adornment of life, derived from the Greek. Now all these

bases, the mythical and the politico-social, have changed; our alleged culture

has no stability, because it has been erected upon insecure conditions and

opinions which are even now almost ready to collapse.--When we thoroughly

grasp Greek culture, then, we see that it is all over with it. The philologist is

thus a great sceptic in the present conditions of our culture and training �

that is his mission. Happy is he if, like Wagner and Schopenhauer, he has a

dim presentiment of those auspicious powers amid which a new culture is

stirring.

  169  Those  who  say:  "But  antiquity  nevertheless  remains  as  a  subject  of

consideration for pure science, even though all its educational purposes may

be disowned," must be answered by the words, What is pure science here!

Actions and characteristics must be judged; and those who judge them must

stand above them: so you must first devote your attention to overcoming

antiquity. If you do not do that, your science is not pure, but impure and

limited . as may now be perceived.

  170

  To overcome Greek antiquity through our own deeds: this would be the

right  task.  But  before  we  can  do  this  we  must  first  know  it!--There  is  a

thoroughness which is merely an excuse for inaction. Let it be recollected

how much Goethe knew of antiquity: certainly not so much as a philologist,

and yet sufficient to contend with it in such a way as to bring about fruitful

results. One should not even know more about a thing than one could create.

Moreover, the only time when we can actually recognise something is when

we endeavour to make it. Let people but attempt to live after the manner of

antiquity, and they will at once come hundreds of miles nearer to antiquity

than they can do with all their erudition.--Our philologists never show that

they strive to emulate antiquity in any way, and thus their antiquity remains

without any effect on the schools.

  The study of the spirit of emulation (Renaissance, Goethe), and the study

of despair.

  The  non-popular  element  in  the  new  culture  of  the  Renaissance:  a

frightful fact!

  171

  The worship of classical antiquity, as it was to be seen in Italy, may be

interpreted as the only earnest, disinterested, and fecund worship which has

yet fallen to the lot of antiquity. It is a splendid example of Don Quixotism;

and  philology  at  best  is  such  Don  Quixotism.  Already  at  the  time  of  the

Alexandrian savants, as with all the sophists of the first and second centuries,

the Atticists, &c., the scholars are imitating something purely and simply

chimerical and pursuing a world that never existed. The same trait is seen

throughout  antiquity �  the  manner  in  which  the  Homeric  heroes  were

copied,  and  all  the  intercourse  held  with  the  myths,  show  traces  of  it.

Gradually all Greek antiquity has become an object of Don Quixotism. It is

impossible to understand our modern world if we do not take into account the

enormous influence of the purely fantastic. This is now confronted by theprinciple �  there  can  be  no  imitation.  Imitation,  however,  is  merely  an

artistic phenomenon, i.e., it is based on appearance . we can accept manners,

thoughts, and so on through imitation; but imitation can create nothing. True,

the creator can borrow from all sides and nourish himself in that way. And it

is only as creators that we shall be able to take anything from the Greeks. But

in what respect can philologists be said to be creators! There must be a few

dirty jobs, such as knackers' men, and also text-revisers: are the philologists

to carry out tasks of this nature?

  172

  What,  then,  is  antiquity  now,  in  the  face  of  modern  art,  science,  and

philosophy? It is no longer the treasure-chamber of all knowledge; for in

natural  and  historical  science  we  have  advanced  greatly  beyond  it.

Oppression by the church has been stopped. A pure knowledge of antiquity is

now possible, but perhaps also a more ineffective and weaker knowledge.--

This is right enough, if effect is known only as effect on the masses; but for

the breeding of higher minds antiquity is more powerful than ever.

  Goethe as a German poet-philologist; Wagner as a still higher stage: his

clear glance for the only worthy position of art. No ancient work has ever had

so  powerful  an  effect  as  the  "Orestes"  had  on  Wagner.  The  objective,

emasculated philologist, who is but a philistine of culture and a worker in

"pure science," is, however, a sad spectacle.

  173

    Between our highest art and philosophy and that which is recognised to

be  truly  the  oldest  antiquity,  there  is  no  contradiction:  they  support  and

harmonise with one another. It is in this that I place my hopes.

  174

  The main standpoints from which to consider the importance of antiquity:

  1. There is nothing about it for young people, for it exhibits man with an

entire freedom from shame.

  2. It is not for direct imitation, but it teaches by which means art has

hitherto been perfected in the highest degree.

  3. It is accessible only to a few, and there should be a police des moeurs,

in charge of it--as there should be also in charge of bad pianists who play

Beethoven.

  4. These few apply this antiquity to the judgment of our own time, as

critics of it; and they judge antiquity by their own ideals and are thus critics

of antiquity.  5. The contract between the Hellenic and the Roman should be studied,

and  also  the  contrast  between  the  early  Hellenic  and  the  late  Hellenic.--

Explanation of the different types of culture.

  175

  The advancement of science at the expense of man is one of the most

pernicious  things  in  the  world.  The  stunted  man  is  a  retrogression  in  the

human  race:  he  throws  a  shadow  over  all  succeeding  generations  The

tendencies and natural purpose of the individual science become degenerate,

and science itself is finally shipwrecked: it has made progress, but has either

no effect at all on life or else an immoral one.

  176

  Men not to be used like things!

  From the former very incomplete philology and knowledge of antiquity

there  flowed  out  a  stream  of  freedom,  while  our  own  highly  developed

knowledge produces slaves and serves the idol of the State.

  177

  There will perhaps come a time when scientific work will be carried on

by women, while the men will have to create, using the word in a spiritual

sense: states, laws, works of art, &c.

  People should study typical antiquity just as they do typical men: i.e.,

imitating what they understand of it, and, when the pattern seems to lie far in

the distance, considering ways and means and preliminary preparations, and

devising stepping-stones.

  178

  The whole feature of study lies in this: that we should study only what we

feel we should like to imitate; what we gladly take up and have the desire to

multiply. What is really wanted is a progressive canon of the ideal model,

suited to boys, youths, and men.

  179

  Goethe grasped antiquity in the right way � invariably with an emulative

soul. But who else did so? One sees nothing of a well-thought-out pedagogics

of this nature: who knows that there is a certain knowledge of antiquity which

cannot be imparted to youths!

  The puerile character of philology: devised by teachers for pupils.

  180

  The  ever  more  and  more  common  form  of  the  ideal:  first  men,  then

institutions, finally tendencies, purposes, or the want of them. The highestform: the conquest of the ideal by a backward movement from tendencies to

institutions, and from institutions to men.

  181

  I will set down in writing what I no longer believe--and also what I do

believe.  Man  stands  in  the  midst  of  the  great  whirlpool  of  forces,  and

imagines that this whirlpool is rational and has a rational aim in view: error!

The only rationality that we know is the small reason of man: he must exert it

to the utmost, and it invariably leaves him in the lurch if he tries to place

himself in the hands of "Providence."

  Our  only  happiness  lies  in  reason;  all  the  remainder  of  the  world  is

dreary. The highest reason, however, is seen by me in the work of the artist,

and he can feel it to be such: there may be something which, when it can be

consciously brought forward, may afford an even greater feeling of reason

and happiness: for example, the course of the solar system, the breeding and

education of a man.

  Happiness lies in rapidity of feeling and thinking: everything else is slow,

gradual, and stupid. The man who could feel the progress of a ray of light

would be greatly enraptured, for it is very rapid.

  Thinking of one's self affords little happiness. But when we do experience

happiness therein the reason is that we are not thinking of ourselves, but of

our ideal. This lies far off; and only the rapid man attains it and rejoices.

  An amalgamation of a great centre of men for the breeding of better men

is the task of the future. The individual must become familiarised with claims

that, when he says Yea to his own will, he also says Yea to the will of that

centre--for example, in reference to a choice, as among women for marriage,

and likewise as to the manner in which his child shall be brought up. Until

now no single individuality, or only the very rarest, have been free: they were

influenced by these conceptions, but likewise by the bad and contradictory

organisation of the individual purposes.

  182

    Education is in the first place instruction in what is necessary, and then in

what is changing and inconstant. The youth is introduced to nature, and the

sway of laws is everywhere pointed out to him; followed by an explanation of

the laws of ordinary society. Even at this early stage the question will arise:

was  it  absolutely  necessary  that  this  should  have  been  so?  He  gradually

comes to need history to ascertain how these things have been brought about.

He  learns  at  the  same  time,  however,  that  they  may  be  changed  intosomething else. What is the extent of man's power over things? This is the

question in connection with all education. To show how things may become

other than what they are we may, for example, point to the Greeks. We need

the Romans to show how things became what they were.

  183

  If, then, the Romans had spurned the Greek culture, they would perhaps

have gone to pieces completely. When could this culture have once again

arisen? Christianity and Romans and barbarians: this would have been an

onslaught: it would have entirely wiped out culture. We see the danger amid

which genius lives. Cicero was one of the greatest benefactors of humanity,

even in his own time.

  There is no "Providence" for genius; it is only for the ordinary run of

people and their wants that such a thing exists: they find their satisfaction,

and later on their justification.

  184

  Thesis:  the  death  of  ancient  culture  inevitable.  Greek  culture  must  be

distinguished as the archetype; and it must be shown how all culture rests

upon shaky conceptions.

  The dangerous meaning of art: as the protectress and galvanisation of

dead and dying conceptions; history, in so far as it wishes to restore to us

feelings which we have overcome. To feel "historically" or "just" towards

what is already past, is only possible when we have risen above it. But the

danger in the adoption of the feelings necessary for this is very great . let the

dead bury their dead, so that we ourselves may not come under the influence

of the smell of the corpses.

                      THE DEATH OF THE OLD CULTURE.

  1. The signification of the studies of antiquity hitherto pursued: obscure;

mendacious.

  2. As soon as they recognise the goal they condemn themselves to death

� for their goal is to describe ancient culture itself as one to be demolished.

  3. The collection of all the conceptions out of which Hellenic culture has

grown up. Criticism of religion, art, society, state, morals.

  4. Christianity is likewise denied.

  5. Art and history--dangerous.

  6. The replacing of the study of antiquity which has become superfluous

for the training of our youth.

  Thus  the  task  of  the  science  of  history  is  completed  and  it  itself  hasbecome superfluous, if the entire inward continuous circle of past efforts has

been condemned. Its place must be taken by the science of the future.

  185

    "Signs" and "miracles" are not believed; only a "Providence" stands in

need  of  such  things.  There  is  no  help  to  be  found  either  in  prayer  or

asceticism or in "vision." If all these things constitute religion, then there is

no more religion for me.

  My religion, if I can still apply this name to something, lies in the work of

breeding  genius  .  from  such  training  everything  is  to  be  hoped.  All

consolation comes from art. Education is love for the offspring; an excess of

love over and beyond our self-love. Religion is "love beyond ourselves." The

work of art is the model of such a love beyond ourselves, and a perfect model

at that.

  186

  The stupidity of the will is Schopenhauer's greatest thought, if thoughts

be judged from the standpoint of power. We can see in Hartmann how he

juggled away this thought. Nobody will ever call something stupid--God.

  187

  This, then, is the new feature of all the future progress of the world �

men must never again be ruled over by religious conceptions. Will they be

any worse? It is not my experience that they behave well and morally under

the yoke of religion; I am not on the side of Demopheles[14] The fear of a

beyond, and then again the fear of divine punishments will hardly have made

men better.

  188

  Where something great makes its appearance and lasts for a relatively

long time, we may premise a careful breeding, as in the case of the Greeks.

How did so many men become free among them? Educate educators! But the

first educators must educate themselves! And it is for these that I write.

  189

  The denial of life is no longer an easy matter: a man may become a

hermit  or  a  monk--and  what  is  thereby  denied!  This  conception  has  now

become deeper . it is above all a discerning denial, a denial based upon the

will to be just; not an indiscriminate and wholesale denial.

  190

  The seer must be affectionate, otherwise men will have no confidence in

him � Cassandra.  191

  The man who to-day wishes to be good and saintly has a more difficult

task  than  formerly  .  in  order  to  be  "good,"  he  must  not  be  so  unjust  to

knowledge as earlier saints were. He would have to be a knowledge-saint: a

man who would link love with knowledge, and who would have nothing to

do with gods or demigods or "Providence," as the Indian saints likewise had

nothing to do with them. He should also be healthy, and should keep himself

so,  otherwise  he  would  necessarily  become  distrustful  of  himself.  And

perhaps he would not bear the slightest resemblance to the ascetic saint, but

would be much more like a man of the world.

  192

  The better the state is organised, the duller will humanity be.

  To make the individual uncomfortable is my task!

  The  great  pleasure  experienced  by  the  man  who  liberates  himself  by

fighting.

  Spiritual heights have had their age in history; inherited energy belongs to

them. In the ideal state all would be over with them.

  193

  The highest judgment on life only arising from the highest energy of life.

The mind must be removed as far as possible from exhaustion.

  In the centre of the world-history judgment will be the most accurate; for

it was there that the greatest geniuses existed.

  The breeding of the genius as the only man who can truly value and deny

life.

  Save your genius! shall be shouted unto the people: set him free! Do all

you can to unshackle him.

  The feeble and poor in spirit must not be allowed to judge life.

  194

  I dream of a combination of men who shall make no concessions, who

shall  show  no  consideration,  and  who  shall  be  willing  to  be  called

"destroyers":  they  apply  the  standard  of  their  criticism  to  everything  and

sacrifice themselves to truth. The bad and the false shall be brought to light!

We will not build prematurely: we do not know, indeed, whether we shall

ever be able to build, or if it would not be better not to build at all. There are

lazy pessimists and resigned ones in this world--and it is to their number that

we refuse to belong!

                                POEMS BY NIETZSCHE

                              Translated by A.M.Ludovici

  Only Fool! Only Poet!

  In the fading light of dusk,

  When the dew's solace begins

  To well down to the earth,

    Invisible, as well as unheard -

  For the comforter dew slips on  Delicate footwear as all gentle consolers -

  Then do you remember, hot heart, remember

  How once you thirsted

  After heavenly tears and dewdrops,

    Scorched and weary, thirsting

  While on yellow paths of grass

  The spiteful evening glances of the sun

  Ran around you through black trees,

    Glowing sun-glances, dazzling with malicious delight.

  "The suitor of truth-you?"-thus they mocked me -

  "No! Only a poet!

  A cunning, plundering, stealthy beast,

  That must lie,

  That knowingly, willingly must lie,

  Lusting after prey,

    Colorfully masked,

    Self-shrouded,

  Prey for itself

  This-the suitor of truth? ...

  Only fool! Only poet!

  Merely speaking colorfully,

  From fools' masks shouting colorfully,

    Climbing about on deceptive word-bridges,

  On misleading rainbows,

    Between false heavens

    Rambling, lurking -

  Only fool! Only poet!

  This-the suitor of truth? ...

  Not still, stiff, smooth, cold,

  Become an image,

  A pillar of God,

  Not set up before temples,

  A god's gatekeeper:

  No! hostile to all such truth statues,

  More at home in any desert than in temples,

  Fraught with cats' mischief,

  Leaping through every window  Swiftly! into every chance,

  Sniffing for every jungle,

  That you in jungles

  Among motley-shagged beasts of prey

  Would run sinfully sound and beautiful and colorful,

  With lusting animal lips,

    Blissfully sneering, blissfully hellish, blissfully bloodthirsty,

    Plundering, prowling, lying would run ...

  Or like the eagle that, for a long time,

  A long time gazes with a fixed stare into abysses,

  Into its abysses ...

  - Oh how they spiral downward,

  Down, down under,

  Into ever deeper depths! -

  Then,

    Suddenly,

    Plummeting straight down

  Wings pulled out

  To pounce on lambs,

  Right down, hot-hungry,

  Lusting for lambs,

  Hating all lamb-souls,

  Grimly hating whatever looks

    Virtuous, sheepish, curly-wooled,

  Dull, with lambs' milk-goodwill ...

  Thus

    Eagle-like, panther-like,

  Are the poet's longings,

  Are your longings under a thousand masks,

  You fool! You poet!...

  You that have looked upon man

  As god and as sheep -

  Tearing to pieces the god in man

  As well as the sheep in man,

  And laughing while tearing -

  This, this is your bliss,

  A panther's and eagle's bliss,  A poet's and fool's bliss!" ...

  In the fading light of dusk,

  When just as the moon's sickle

  In between green and crimson-reds

    Enviously creeps -

  The day's enemy,

  With every stealthy step

  At rose hammocks

  Scything, till they sink,

  Sink down pale in nightfall:

  Thus I myself once sank,

  Out of my truth-madness,

  Out of my day-longings,

  Weary of day, sick from the light -

  Sank downward, eveningward, shadowward,

  By one truth

  Burnt and thirsty -

  Do you still remember, hot heart, remember

  How you thirsted then? -

  That I be exiled

  From all truth!

  Only fool!

  Only poet!...

  Among Daughters of the Desert

  1.

  "Don't go!" said the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra's shadow.

"Stay with us-otherwise our old dull affliction might seize us again.

  That old magician has already given us his worst for our benefit, and

behold,  that  good  pious  pope  there  has  tears  in  his  eyes  and  has  again

embarked on the sea of melancholy.

  These kings here may still put on a pleasant countenance: but had they no

witnesses, I wager that for them too the wicked game would recommence-

  The wicked game of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy, of imposing

skies, of stolen suns, of howling autumn winds-

  The wicked game of our own howling and cries of distress: Stay with us,

Zarathustra! Here there is much concealed misery that wants to speak, much

evening, much cloud, much musty air!  You have nourished us with strong food for men and fortifying maxims:

do not let the frail effeminate spirits seize us again for dessert!

  You alone make the air around you strong and clear! Have I ever found

such good air on earth than with you in your cave?

  I have seen many lands, my nose has learned to test and assess many

kinds of air: but with you my nostrils taste their greatest delight!

  Unless , unless-oh forgive an old memory! Forgive me an old after-dinner

song, which I once composed among the daughters of the desert.

  For with them the air was equally good, clear, and oriental; never was I

farther away from cloudy, damp, melancholy old Europe!

  At that time I loved such Oriental girls and other blue skies, over which

no clouds and no thoughts hung.

  You would not believe how dutifully they sat there, when they were not

dancing, deep, but without thoughts, like little secrets, like ribboned riddles,

like after-dinner nuts-

  Colorful  and  strange,  forsooth!  but  without  clouds:  riddles  that  let

themselves be guessed: for such girls I then conceived an after-dinner psalm."

  Thus spoke the wanderer, who called himself Zarathustra's shadow; and

before  anyone  answered  him,  he  had  already  seized  the  harp  of  the  old

magician, crossed his legs and looked around, composed and wise: but with

his nostrils he drew in the air slowly and inquiringly, as one tastes the new air

in a foreign land. At last he began to sing with a kind of roar.

  2.

  The desert grows: woe to him in whom deserts hide...

  3.

  Ha!

  Solemn!

  A worthy beginning!

  Solemnly African!

  Worthy of a lion

  Or of a moral screaming monkey ...

  - But nothing for you,

  You most beloved maidens,

  At whose feet I,

  A European under palm trees,

  Am allowed to sit. Selah.

  Truly wonderful!  Here I now sit,

  Near the desert and yet

  So far from the desert again,

  And in no way desolate:

  To wit, gulped down

  By this smallest oasis -

  It just opened up yawning

  Its lovely mouth,

  The most redolent of all little mouths:

  Then I fell in,

  Down, through-among you,

  You most beloved maidens. Selah.

  Hail, hail to that whale,

  If he let his guest be so

  Well off! -you understand

  My learned allusion? ...

  Hail to his belly,

  If it was as

  Lovely an oasis-belly

  As this: yet I cast doubt on it.

  For I come from Europe,

  Which is more doubt-addicted than any nagging old wife.

  May God improve it!

  Amen!

  Here I now sit,

  In this smallest oasis,

  Like a date,

  Brown, sweet through, gold-oozing,

  Lusting for the round mouth of a girl,

  But even more for girlish

  Ice-cold, snow-white, cutting

    Biting-teeth: for after these

  The hearts of all hot dates lust. Selah.

  Similar, all-too-similar

  To the aforesaid Mediterranean fruit,

  I lie here, with little

  Winged beetles  Dancing about and playing around,

  Just like even smaller,

  More foolish, more sinful

    Wishes and notions -

    Surrounded by you,

  You silent, you ominous

    Girl-kittens

  Dudu und Suleika -

    Ensphinxed, to cram a lot of

  Feelings into one word

  (-May God forgive me

  This sin of speech! ...)-

  I sit here, sniffing the best air,

  Verily, air of paradise,

  Clear, mild air, gold-striped,

  As good air as ever

  Fell down from the moon,

  Be it by chance

  Or did it happen from wantonness?

  As the old poets tell.

  Yet I, a sceptic, have my doubts,

  For I come

  From Europe,

  Which is more doubt-addicted than any nagging old wife.

  May God improve it!

  Amen!

    Drinking in this fairest air,

  My nostrils swollen like goblets,

  Without future, without memories,

  Thus I sit here, you

  Most beloved maidens,

  And watch the palm tree,

  As it, like a dancer,

  Bends and arches and sways at the hips -

  One does it too, if one watches long ...

  Like a dancer, who, as it would seem to me,

  Has stood too long, precariously long  Always, always only on one little leg? -

  For she has forgotten, it would seem to me,

  The other leg?

  At least in vain

  I sought the missing

    Twin-jewel

  - Namely, the other leg -

  In the holy proximity

  Of her most beloved, most delicate

  Fanned-, and flittering-, and tinseled-tutus.

  Yes, if you would, you fair maidens,

  Quite believe me,

  She has lost it ...

  Oh my! oh my! oh my! oh my! oh my!...

  It is gone,

  Gone forever,

  The other leg!

  Oh what a shame about that lovely other leg!

    Where-whence may it be lamenting forsaken,

  This lonely leg?

  Perhaps in fear of a

  Grim, yellow, blond-maned

    Lion-monster? Or maybe even

  Gnawed off, nibbled off -

  Pitiful, alas! alas! Nibbled off! Selah.

  Oh weep not,

  Soft hearts!

  Weep not, you

    Date-hearts! Milk-bosoms!

  You little-licorice-

    Heart-sacs!

  Be a man, Suleika! Courage! Courage!

  Weep no more,

  Pale Dudu!-

  Or should perhaps

  Something fortifying, heart-fortifying

  Be called for here?  An anointed maxim?

  A more solemn exhortation? ...

  Ha! Up, dignity!

  Blow, blow again,

  Bellows of virtue!

  Ha!

  Once more roar,

  Roar morally,

  Roar like a moral lion before the daughters of the desert!

  - For virtuous howling,

  You most beloved maidens,

  Is more than anything

  European fervor, European ravenous appetite!

  And yet here I stand,

  As a European,

  I cannot do else, God help me!

  Amen!

  The desert grows: woe to him in whom deserts hide!

  Stone grinds against stone, the desert devours and strangles,

    Glowing brown monstrous death stares

  And chews; its life is to chew ...

  Do not forget, man, consumed by lust:

  you-are the stone, the desert, are death...

  Ultimate Will

  To die thus,

  As once I saw him die -

  The friend who threw divine thunderbolts and

  Glances into my dark youth.

  Sportive and profound,

  A dancer in the battle -

  The most cheerful among warriors,

  The gravest among victors,

  A fate standing upon his fate,

  Hard, reflective, calculating:

    Trembling because he triumphed,

    Rejoicing in that he triumphed dying:

    Commanding while he died -  And he commanded that one destroy ...

  To die thus,

  As once I saw him die -

    Vanquishing, destroying ...

  Cf. Notebooks, KSA 10, 594, Fall 1883 20 [11] (Notes for Thus Spoke

Zarathustra):

  Of the One Victory.

  Thus, as once I saw him conquering and dying: the friend, who threw

divine moments and lightning into my dark youth -

  sportive and profound, storming forward for joy even in the storm of

battle,  forward  in  bloody  pain,  and  where  the  chosen  flags  of  the  enemy

neared, -

  among  the  dying  the  most  cheerful,  among  the  victors  the  gravest,

reflective, calculating, standing on his fate-trembling about it, laughing about

it, that he triumphed dying -

    commanding while he died:-and he commanded that one destroy and not

be sparing -

  Oh you my will, my in-me, over-me! you my necessity! Give that I also

conquer-and save me up for this one victory!

  Preserve and save me up and guard me from all small victories, you gift

of my soul and turning point of all need, you my necessity!

  [Cf. Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Old and New Tables 30.]

  Amid Birds of Prey

  Whoever tends to descend here,

  How quickly

  The depths swallow them! -

  But you, Zarathustra,

  Still love the abyss -

  Do you, just as the spruce?

  Its roots shoot down, where

  The rock itself tremors

  Gazing into the depths -

  It tarries at abysses,

  Where everything around

  Tends to fall:

  Amid the impatience

  Of the rough boulders and torrential streams  Patiently enduring, firm, silent,

  Solitary ...

  Solitary!

  Who would even venture

  To be a guest here,

  To be your guest? ...

  A bird of prey perhaps:

  who might well hang,

  the steadfast patient sufferer,

  Gloating delightfully in its coat,

  With mad laughter,

  A bird of prey's laughter ...

  Why so steadfast? -

    Cruelly, it scoffs:

  One must have wings, if one loves the abyss ...

  One must not remain suspended,

  Like you, hanged one! -

  Oh Zarathustra,

  Cruelest nimrod!

  Recently still a hunter of God,

  The snare of all virtue,

  The arrow of evil!

  Now -

    Hunted by yourself,

  Your own prey,

  Bored into yourself ...

  Now -

  Alone with yourself,

  Paired in your own knowledge,

  Amid a hundred reflections

  Before your false self,

  Amid a hundred dubious

  Memories,

  Weary from every hurt,

    Chilled by every frost,

  Strangled by your own rope,

    Self-knower!    Self-hangman!

  Why did you bind yourself

  With the rope of your wisdom?

  Why did you seduce yourself

  Into the paradise of the ancient serpent?

  Why did you crawl into yourself

  In you-into you?

  An invalid now,

  One who is sick from snake venom;

  A prisoner now,

  One who drew the hardest lot:

  In your own shaft

  Laboring bent over,

    Excavating yourself,

  Digging into yourself,

  Without aid,

  Stiff,

  A corpse -

  Overpiled by a hundred burdens,

  By your overburdens,

  One in the know!

  A self-knower!

  The wise Zarathustra! ...

  You sought the heaviest burden

  Yet found yourself -

  Cannot cast off yourself from you...

    Lurking,

    Crouching,

  One who no longer stands upright!

  You are deeply rooted in your tomb,

  Tangled spirit! ...

  And yet recently so proud,

  Upon all your stilted pride!

  Recently still the godless hermit,

  The co-settler with the devil,

  The scarlet prince of all arrogance! ...

  Now -    Between two voids

  One who is twisted,

  A question mark,

  A weary enigma -

  An enigma for birds of prey ...

  They'll certainly "dissolve" you,

  They no doubt hunger after your "dissolution,"

  Indeed they flutter about you, their enigma,

  Around you, hanged man! ...

  Oh Zarathustra! ...

    Self-knower! ...

    Self-hangman! ...

  The Beacon

  ["Das Feuerzeichen," literally: "The Fire Signal."]

  Here, where an island grew between seas,

  A stone altar steeply piled up,

  Here beneath blackened sky,

    Zarathustra lit his mountain fire,

  The beacon for mariners driven off course,

  The question mark for those who have answers ...

  This flame with a white-grey belly -

  Flickers its greedy tongue into the cold beyond,

  Bends its neck towards ever purer heights -

  A raised serpent of impatience:

  This signal I placed before me.

  My soul is this flame,

    Insatiable for new expanses

  To blaze upward, upward in silent passion.

  Why did Zarathustra flee from animals and men?

  Why did he run away suddenly from all settled lands?

  Six solitudes he knew already -

  But the sea itself was not lonely enough for him,

  The island let him rise, on the mountain he became the flame,

  Into a seventh solitude,

  Searching now, he casts a hook over his head.

  Lost mariners! Wreckage of ancient stars!

  You seas of the future! Unexplored sky!  Now I cast my hook towards all solitary ones:

  Give an answer to the impatience of the flame,

  Catch me, fisherman on high mountains,

  My seventh ultimate solitude! - -

  Ariadne's Lament

  Who will warm me, who loves me still?

  Give warm hands!

  Give the heart's brazier!

  Prone, shuddering

  Like one half dead, whose feet are warmed;

  Shaken, alas! by unknown fevers,

    Trembling at pointed arrows of glacial frost,

    Hunted by you, Thought!

    Nameless! Cloaked! Horrid!

  You hunter behind clouds!

  Struck down by your lightning,

  Your scornful eye, glaring at me out of the dark!

  Thus I lie,

    Writhing, twisted, tormented

  By all the eternal afflictions,

  Struck

  By you, cruelest hunter,

  You unknown-god...

  Strike deeper!

  Strike one more time!

  Stab, break this heart!

  Why all this affliction

  With blunt-toothed arrows?

  How can you gaze evermore,

  Unweary of human agony,

  With the spiteful lightning eyes of gods?

  You do not wish to kill,

  Only to torment, torment?

  Why torment-me,

  You spiteful unknown god?

  Aha!

  You creep closer  Around midnight?...

  What do you want?

  Speak!

  You push me, press upon me,

  Ah, already much too close!

  You hear me breathing,

  You eavesdrop on my heart,

  Most jealous one! -

  What are you jealous of anyway?

  Away! Away!

  What's the ladder for?

  Do you want inside,

  Would you get into my heart,

  And enter

  My most secret thoughts?

    Shameless one! Unknown! Thief!

  What do you wish to steal for yourself?

  What do you wish to hear for yourself?

  What will you gain by torture,

  You torturer!

    You-executioner-god!

  Or am I, like a dog,

  To wallow before you?

  Devoted, eager due to my

  Love for you-fawning over you?

  In vain!

  It stabs again!

  Cruelest sting!

  I am not your dog, only your prey,

  Cruelest hunter!

  Your proudest prisoner,

  You robber behind clouds...

  Speak finally!

  You, cloaked by lightning! Unknown! Speak!

  What do you want, highwayman, from-me?...

  What?

  A ransom?  What do you want for ransom?

  Demand much-so advises my pride!

  And talk little-my pride advises as well!

  Aha!

    Me?-you want me?

  Me-all of me?...

  Aha!

  And tormenting me, fool that you are,

  You wrack my pride?

  Give me love-who warms me still?

  Who loves me still?

  Give warm hands,

  Give the heart's brazier,

  Give me, the loneliest one,

  Ice, alas! whom ice sevenfold

  Has taught to yearn for enemies,

  Even for my enemies

  Give, yes, surrender to me,

  Cruelest enemy -

    Yourself!...

  Gone!

  He has fled,

  My only companion,

  My splendid enemy,

  My unknown,

  My executioner-god!...

  No!

  Come back!

  With all your afflictions!

  All my tears gush forth

  To you they stream

  And the last flames of my heart

  Glow for you.

  Oh, come back,

  My unknown god! my pain!

  My ultimate happiness!...

  A lightening bolt. Dionysus becomes visible in emerald beauty.    Dionysus:

  Be clever, Ariadne!...

  You have little ears; you have my ears:

  Put a clever word in them! -

  Must one not first hate oneself, in order to love oneself?...

  I am your labyrinth...

  Fame and Eternity

  1.

  How long will you sit

  on your misfortune?

  Watch out! You hatch me yet

  Another egg,

  A basilisk-egg

  Out of your long misery.

  Why did Zarathustra sneak along the mountains? -

  Distrustful, ulcerous, gloomy,

  One who long lies in wait -

  But suddenly, lightning,

  Bright, terrible, a blast

    Heavenwards out of the abyss:

  The mountains themselves shake from

  The bowels of the earth ...

  Where hate and lightning-flash

  Become one, a curse -

  Now Zarathustra's wrath cuts across the mountains,

  A storm-cloud creeps along its way.

  Sneak off, one who has a last cover!

  Into bed with you, you weakling!

  Now rolling thunder over the vaults,

  Then shaking, as the beams and wall,

  Then flickering lightning and sulphur-yellow truths -

    Zarathustra curses ...

  2.

  This coin, with which

  All the world pays,

  Fame -

  I grasp this coin with gloves,  With disgust I trample it under me.

  Who wants to be paid?

  Those for sale ...

  Whoever is for sale, seizes

  With sticky hands

  All the world's coin-jingle-jangle fame!

  - You want to buy them?

  They're all for sale.

  But offer much!

  Jingle with a full purse!

  - Otherwise you fortify them,

  You fortify their virtue ...

  They are all virtuous.

  Fame and virtue-it rhymes. [Ruhm und Tugend-das reimt sich."]

  As long as the world lives,

  It will pay virtue-prattling

  With fame-rattling -

  The world lives on this noise ...

  Before all the virtuous

  I want to be guilty,

  Called guilty of each great offence!

  Before all fame-trumpets

  My ambition will become a worm -

  Among those I desire

  To be the lowest ...

  This coin, with which

  All the world pays,

  Fame -

  I grasp this coin with gloves,

  With disgust I trample it under me.

  3.

  Hush! -

  From great things-I see a great deal! -

  One should keep silent

  Or speak greatly:

  Speak greatly, my delighted wisdom!

  Up there I see -  Rolling seas of light:

  - Oh night, oh silence, oh deathly silent uproar!...

  I see a sign -

  From the distant beyond

  A glittering constellation slowly sinks towards me...

  Supreme star of being!

  Tablet of eternal forms!

  You come towards me? -

  Why hasn't anyone beheld

  Your mute beauty -

  Why doesn't it escape my gaze?

  Sign of necessity!

  Tablet of eternal forms!

  - But of course you know it:

  What everyone hates,

  What I alone love,

  That you are eternal!

  That you are necessary!

  My love is ever ignited

  Only through necessity.

  Sign of necessity!

  Supreme star of being! -

  That no desire attains,

  That no No desecrates,

  Eternal Yes of being,

  Eternally I am your Yes:

  For I love you, O eternity! - -

  On the Poverty of the Richest

  For ten years now -

  No drop has reached me,

  No humid wind, no dew of love -

  A rainless land -

  Now I beseech my wisdom

  Not to become miserly in this drought:

  Pour out of me, my trickling dew,

  My own rain for the yellowed desert!  Once I commanded the clouds

  To move away from my mountains -

  Once I spoke, "More light, for your shady places!"

  Today, I entice them so that they come:

  Give shade to me with your udders! -

  I want to milk

  You cows on high!

    Milkwarm wisdom, sweet dew of love

  I pour over the land.

  Begone, begone, truths

  That gloomily watch over you!

  I do not want to see on my mountains

  Bitter impatient truths.

  Today the truth approaches

  Me with a gilded smile

  Sweetened by the sun, from bronzed love -

  I break off only a ripe truth from the tree.

  Today I stretch out my hand

  To the curls of chance,

  Clever enough

  To lead chance along like a child, to outfox it.

  Today I want to be hospitable

  To the unwelcome,

  I don't even want to be sharp against destiny -

    Zarathustra is not a hedgehog.

  My soul,

    Insatiable with its tongue,

  Has already licked all the good and bad things,

  It has dived down into every depth

  But ever like a cork,

  It always floats again to the top,

  It flits about like oil over brown seas:

    Thanks to this soul one calls me the happy one.

  Who are father and mother to me?

  Is not my father the prince of superabundance

  And my mother tranquil laughter?

  Did not these two in bond of marriage create  Me, animal of enigmas,

  Me, unfriendly light,

  Me, prodigal of all wisdom, Zarathustra?

    Suffering today from tenderness,

  A thawing wind,

    Zarathustra waits seated, waits in his mountains -

  In his own juice

  Becoming sweet and stewed,

    Underneath his summit,

    Underneath his ice,

  Weary and blissful,

  A creator on his seventh day.

  Hush!

  A truth glides over me

  Like a cloud -

  It strikes me with invisible lightning.

  Its happiness climbs slowly

  Unto me by broad stairs:

  Come, come, beloved truth!

  Hush!

  It's my truth!

  From demurring eyes,

  From velvet shudderings

  Its glance strikes at me,

    Charming, evil, the glance of a girl...

  She found the base of my happiness

  She found me-ha! how did she figure it out? -

  A crimson dragon lurks

    Within the abyss of her girl-glance.

  Hush! My truth speaks! -

  Dear you, Zarathustra!

  You look like one

  Who has swallowed gold:

  One day they must slit open your belly!...

  You are too rich,

  You corruptor of many!

  You make too many envious,  You make too many poor...

  I am cast into shadow by your light -

  I shiver: go away, you rich one,

  Go, Zarathustra, away from your sun!...

  You would like to give, give away your superabundance,

  But you yourself are the superfluous one!

  Be clever, you rich one!

  First give away yourself, oh Zarathustra!

  For ten years now -

  And no drop has reached you?

  No humid wind? no dew of love?

  But who ought to love thee as well,

  You over-rich-one?

  Your happiness creates nothing but aridity,

  Makes a dearth of love -

  A rainless land...

  No one thanks you any longer,

  But you thank everyone

  Who takes from you:

  Hence,

    Over-rich-one,

  I see you as the poorest of all the rich ones!

  You sacrifice yourself, your wealth torments you,

  You give away yourself,

  You don't take care of yourself, you don't love yourself;

  Great agony always compels you,

  The agony of an overflowing barn, an overabundant heart;

  But no one thanks you any longer...

  You must become poorer,

  Unwise wise one!

  If you wish to be loved.

  One loves only the suffering man,

  One gives love only to the hungry man:

  First give away yourself, oh Zarathustra!

  -I am your truth...        ON THE FUTURE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

                        TRANSLATED BY J.M. KENNEDY

                                        PREFACE.

  The reader from whom I expect something must possess three qualities:

he must be calm and must read without haste; he must not be ever interposing

his own personality and his own special "culture"; and he must not expect as

the ultimate results of his study of these pages that he will be presented with a

set of new formul�. I do not propose to furnish formul� or new plans of

study for Gymnasia or other schools; and I am much more inclined to admire

the extraordinary power of those who are able to cover the whole distance

between  the  depths  of  empiricism  and  the  heights  of  special  culture-

problems, and who again descend to the level of the driest rules and the most

neatly expressed formul�. I shall be content if only I can ascend a tolerably

lofty mountain, from the summit of which, after having recovered my breath,

I may obtain a general survey of the ground; for I shall never be able, in this

book, to satisfy the votaries of tabulated rules. Indeed, I see a time coming

when  serious  men,  working  together  in  the  service  of  a  completely

rejuvenated and purified culture, may again become the directors of a system

of  everyday  instruction,  calculated  to  promote  that  culture;  and  they  will

probably be compelled once more to draw up sets of rules: but how remote

this  time  now  seems!  And  what  may  not  happen  meanwhile!  It  is  just

possible  that  between  now  and  then  all  Gymnasia--yea,  and  perhaps  all

universities, may be destroyed, or have become so utterly transformed that

their very regulations may, in the eyes of future generations, seem to be but

the relics of the cave-dwellers' age.

  This book is intended for calm readers,--for men who have not yet been

drawn into the mad headlong rush of our hurry-skurrying age, and who do

not  experience  any  idolatrous  delight  in  throwing  themselves  beneath  its

chariot-wheels. It is for men, therefore, who are not accustomed to estimate

the value of everything according to the amount of time it either saves or

wastes.  In  short,  it  is  for  the  few.  These,  we  believe,  "still  have  time."

Without any qualms of conscience they may improve the most fruitful and

vigorous hours of their day in meditating on the future of our education; they

may even believe when the evening has come that they have used their day in

the most dignified and useful way, namely, in the meditatio generis futuri. No

one among them has yet forgotten to think while reading a book; he still

understands the secret of reading between the lines, and is indeed so generousin what he himself brings to his study, that he continues to reflect upon what

he has read, perhaps long after he has laid the book aside. And he does this,

not because he wishes to write a criticism about it or even another book; but

simply because reflection is a pleasant pastime to him. Frivolous spendthrift!

Thou art a reader after my own heart; for thou wilt be patient enough to

accompany an author any distance, even though he himself cannot yet see the

goal at which he is aiming,--even though he himself feels only that he must at

all events honestly believe in a goal, in order that a future and possibly very

remote generation may come face to face with that towards which we are

now blindly and instinctively groping. Should any reader demur and suggest

that all that is required is prompt and bold reform; should he imagine that a

new "organisation" introduced by the State, were all that is necessary, then

we fear he would have misunderstood not only the author but the very nature

of the problem under consideration.

  The third and most important stipulation is, that he should in no case be

constantly bringing himself and his own "culture" forward, after the style of

most modern men, as the correct standard and measure of all things. We

would have him so highly educated that he could even think meanly of his

education or despise it altogether. Only thus would he be able to trust entirely

to  the  author's  guidance;  for  it  is  only  by  virtue  of  ignorance  and  his

consciousness of ignorance, that the latter can dare to make himself heard.

Finally, the author would wish his reader to be fully alive to the specific

character of our present barbarism and of that which distinguishes us, as the

barbarians of the nineteenth century, from other barbarians.

  Now, with this book in his hand, the writer seeks all those who may

happen to be wandering, hither and thither, impelled by feelings similar to his

own. Allow yourselves to be discovered--ye lonely ones in whose existence I

believe! Ye unselfish ones, suffering in yourselves from the corruption of the

German spirit! Ye contemplative ones who cannot, with hasty glances, turn

your eyes swiftly from one surface to another! Ye lofty thinkers, of whom

Aristotle said that ye wander through life vacillating and inactive so long as

no great honour or glorious Cause calleth you to deeds! It is you I summon!

Refrain  this  once  from  seeking  refuge  in  your  lairs  of  solitude  and  dark

misgivings. Bethink you that this book was framed to be your herald. When

ye shall go forth to battle in your full panoply, who among you will not

rejoice in looking back upon the herald who rallied you?

                                      INTRODUCTION.  The title I gave to these lectures ought, like all titles, to have been as

definite, as plain, and as significant as possible; now, however, I observe that

owing to a certain excess of precision, in its present form it is too short and

consequently misleading. My first duty therefore will be to explain the title,

together with the object of these lectures, to you, and to apologise for being

obliged to do this. When I promised to speak to you concerning the future of

our educational institutions, I was not thinking especially of the evolution of

our  particular  institutions  in  Bale.  However  frequently  my  general

observations may seem to bear particular application to our own conditions

here, I personally have no desire to draw these inferences, and do not wish to

be held responsible if they should be drawn, for the simple reason that I

consider myself still far too much an inexperienced stranger among you, and

much  too  superficially  acquainted  with  your  methods,  to  pretend  to  pass

judgment  upon  any  such  special  order  of  scholastic  establishments,  or  to

predict the probable course their development will follow. On the other hand,

I know full well under what distinguished auspices I have to deliver these

lectures--namely,  in  a  city  which  is  striving  to  educate  and  enlighten  its

inhabitants on a scale so magnificently out of proportion to its size, that it

must put all larger cities to shame. This being so, I presume I am justified in

assuming that in a quarter where so much is done for the things of which I

wish to speak, people must also think a good deal about them. My desire--

yea, my very first condition, therefore, would be to become united in spirit

with  those  who  have  not  only  thought  very  deeply  upon  educational

problems, but have also the will to promote what they think to be right by all

the means in their power. And, in view of the difficulties of my task and the

limited time at my disposal, to such listeners, alone, in my audience, shall I

be able to make myself understood--and even then, it will be on condition

that they shall guess what I can do no more than suggest, that they shall

supply what I am compelled to omit; in brief, that they shall need but to be

reminded and not to be taught. Thus, while I disclaim all desire of being

taken for an uninvited adviser on questions relating to the schools and the

University of Bale, I repudiate even more emphatically still the r�le of a

prophet standing on the horizon of civilisation and pretending to predict the

future of education and of scholastic organisation. I can no more project my

vision through such vast periods of time than I can rely upon its accuracy

when it is brought too close to an object under examination. With my title:

Our Educational Institutions, I wish to refer neither to the establishments inBale nor to the incalculably vast number of other scholastic institutions which

exist  throughout  the  nations  of  the  world  to-day;  but  I  wish  to  refer  to

German institutions of the kind which we rejoice in here. It is their future that

will  now  engage  our  attention,  i.e.  the  future  of  German  elementary,

secondary, and public schools (Gymnasien) and universities. While pursuing

our  discussion,  however,  we  shall  for  once  avoid  all  comparisons  and

valuations, and guard more especially against that flattering illusion that our

conditions should be regarded as the standard for all others and as surpassing

them. Let it suffice that they are our institutions, that they have not become a

part of ourselves by mere accident, and were not laid upon us like a garment;

but  that  they  are  living  monuments  of  important  steps  in  the  progress  of

civilisation, in some respects even the furniture of a bygone age, and as such

link us with the past of our people, and are such a sacred and venerable

legacy that I can only undertake to speak of the future of our educational

institutions in the sense of their being a most probable approximation to the

ideal  spirit  which  gave  them  birth.  I  am,  moreover,  convinced  that  the

numerous  alterations  which  have  been  introduced  into  these  institutions

within recent years, with the view of bringing them up-to-date, are for the

most part but distortions and aberrations of the originally sublime tendencies

given to them at their foundation. And what we dare to hope from the future,

in  this  behalf,  partakes  so  much  of  the  nature  of  a  rejuvenation,  a

reviviscence, and a refining of the spirit of Germany that, as a result of this

very process, our educational institutions may also be indirectly remoulded

and born again, so as to appear at once old and new, whereas now they only

profess to be "modern" or "up-to-date."

  Now it is only in the spirit of the hope above mentioned that I wish to

speak of the future of our educational institutions: and this is the second point

in regard to which I must tender an apology from the outset. The "prophet"

pose is such a presumptuous one that it seems almost ridiculous to deny that I

have the intention of adopting it. No one should attempt to describe the future

of our education, and the means and methods of instruction relating thereto,

in a prophetic spirit, unless he can prove that the picture he draws already

exists  in  germ  to-day,  and  that  all  that  is  required  is  the  extension  and

development of this embryo if the necessary modifications are to be produced

in  schools  and  other  educational  institutions.  All  I  ask,  is,  like  a  Roman

haruspex, to be allowed to steal glimpses of the future out of the very entrails

of existing conditions, which, in this case, means no more than to hand thelaurels of victory to any one of the many forces tending to make itself felt in

our present educational system, despite the fact that the force in question may

be neither a favourite, an esteemed, nor a very extensive one. I confidently

assert that it will be victorious, however, because it has the strongest and

mightiest of all allies in nature herself; and in this respect it were well did we

not forget that scores of the very first principles of our modern educational

methods are thoroughly artificial, and that the most fatal weaknesses of the

present day are to be ascribed to this artificiality. He who feels in complete

harmony  with  the  present  state  of  affairs  and  who  acquiesces  in  it  as

something "selbstverst�ndliches,"[1] excites our envy neither in regard to

his  faith  nor  in  regard  to  that  egregious  word  "selbstverst�ndlich,"  so

frequently heard in fashionable circles.

  He, however, who holds the opposite view and is therefore in despair,

does not need to fight any longer: all he requires is to give himself up to

solitude in order soon to be alone. Albeit, between those who take everything

for granted and these anchorites, there stand the fighters--that is to say, those

who still have hope, and as the noblest and sublimest example of this class,

we recognise Schiller as he is described by Goethe in his "Epilogue to the

Bell."

    "Brighter  now  glow'd  his  cheek,  and  still  more  bright  With  that

unchanging, ever youthful glow:-- That courage which o'ercomes, in hard-

fought fight, Sooner or later ev'ry earthly foe,-- That faith which soaring to

the realms of light, Now boldly presseth on, now bendeth low, So that the

good may work, wax, thrive amain, So that the day the noble may attain."[2]

  I should like you to regard all I have just said as a kind of preface, the

object of which is to illustrate the title of my lectures and to guard me against

any possible misunderstanding and unjustified criticisms. And now, in order

to give you a rough outline of the range of ideas from which I shall attempt to

form a judgment concerning our educational institutions, before proceeding

to disclose my views and turning from the title to the main theme, I shall lay

a  scheme  before  you  which,  like  a  coat  of  arms,  will  serve  to  warn  all

strangers who come to my door, as to the nature of the house they are about

to enter, in case they may feel inclined, after having examined the device, to

turn their backs on the premises that bear it. My scheme is as follows:--

  Two seemingly antagonistic forces, equally deleterious in their actions

and ultimately combining to produce their results, are at present ruling over

our educational institutions, although these were based originally upon verydifferent  principles.  These  forces  are:  a  striving  to  achieve  the  greatest

possible extension of education on the one hand, and a tendency to minimise

and to weaken it on the other. The first-named would fain spread learning

among  the  greatest  possible  number  of  people,  the  second  would  compel

education to renounce its highest and most independent claims in order to

subordinate  itself  to  the  service  of  the  State.  In  the  face  of  these  two

antagonistic tendencies, we could but give ourselves up to despair, did we not

see the possibility of promoting the cause of two other contending factors

which are fortunately as completely German as they are rich in promises for

the future; I refer to the present movement towards limiting and concentrating

education as the antithesis of the first of the forces above mentioned, and that

other  movement  towards  the  strengthening  and  the  independence  of

education as the antithesis of the second force. If we should seek a warrant

for our belief in the ultimate victory of the two last-named movements, we

could find it in the fact that both of the forces which we hold to be deleterious

are  so  opposed  to  the  eternal  purpose  of  nature  as  the  concentration  of

education for the few is in harmony with it, and is true, whereas the first two

forces could succeed only in founding a culture false to the root.

                                    FIRST LECTURE.

    (Delivered on the 16th of January 1872.)

  Ladies and Gentlemen,--The subject I now propose to consider with you

is such a serious and important one, and is in a sense so disquieting, that, like

you, I would gladly turn to any one who could proffer some information

concerning it,--were he ever so young, were his ideas ever so improbable--

provided that he were able, by the exercise of his own faculties, to furnish

some satisfactory and sufficient explanation. It is just possible that he may

have had the opportunity of hearing sound views expressed in reference to

the vexed question of the future of our educational institutions, and that he

may  wish  to  repeat  them  to  you;  he  may  even  have  had  distinguished

teachers, fully qualified to foretell what is to come, and, like the haruspices of

Rome, able to do so after an inspection of the entrails of the Present.

  Indeed, you yourselves may expect something of this kind from me. I

happened once, in strange but perfectly harmless circumstances, to overhear aconversation  on  this  subject  between  two  remarkable  men,  and  the  more

striking points of the discussion, together with their manner of handling the

theme, are so indelibly imprinted on my memory that, whenever I reflect on

these matters, I invariably find myself falling into their grooves of thought. I

cannot, however, profess to have the same courageous confidence which they

displayed, both in their daring utterance of forbidden truths, and in the still

more  daring  conception  of  the  hopes  with  which  they  astonished  me.  It

therefore seemed to me to be in the highest degree important that a record of

this conversation should be made, so that others might be incited to form a

judgment concerning the striking views and conclusions it contains: and, to

this end, I had special grounds for believing that I should do well to avail

myself of the opportunity afforded by this course of lectures.

  I  am  well  aware  of  the  nature  of  the  community  to  whose  serious

consideration I now wish to commend that conversation--I know it to be a

community which is striving to educate and enlighten its members on a scale

so magnificently out of proportion to its size that it must put all larger cities

to shame. This being so, I presume I may take it for granted that in a quarter

where so much is done for the things of which I wish to speak, people must

also think a good deal about them. In my account of the conversation already

mentioned, I shall be able to make myself completely understood only to

those among my audience who will be able to guess what I can do no more

than suggest, who will supply what I am compelled to omit, and who, above

all, need but to be reminded and not taught.

  Listen,  therefore,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  while  I  recount  my  harmless

experience and the less harmless conversation between the two gentlemen

whom, so far, I have not named.

  Let us now imagine ourselves in the position of a young student--that is to

say, in a position which, in our present age of bewildering movement and

feverish excitability, has become an almost impossible one. It is necessary to

have lived through it in order to believe that such careless self-lulling and

comfortable indifference to the moment, or to time in general, are possible. In

this condition I, and a friend about my own age, spent a year at the University

of Bonn on the Rhine,--it was a year which, in its complete lack of plans and

projects  for  the  future,  seems  almost  like  a  dream  to  me  now--a  dream

framed, as it were, by two periods of growth. We two remained quiet and

peaceful, although we were surrounded by fellows who in the main were very

differently  disposed,  and  from  time  to  time  we  experienced  considerabledifficulty in meeting and resisting the somewhat too pressing advances of the

young men of our own age. Now, however, that I can look upon the stand we

had to take against these opposing forces, I cannot help associating them in

my mind with those checks we are wont to receive in our dreams, as, for

instance, when we imagine we are able to fly and yet feel ourselves held back

by some incomprehensible power.

  I and my friend had many reminiscences in common, and these dated

from the period of our boyhood upwards. One of these I must relate to you,

since it forms a sort of prelude to the harmless experience already mentioned.

On  the  occasion  of  a  certain  journey  up  the  Rhine,  which  we  had  made

together one summer, it happened that he and I independently conceived the

very same plan at the same hour and on the same spot, and we were so struck

by  this  unwonted  coincidence  that  we  determined  to  carry  the  plan  out

forthwith. We resolved to found a kind of small club which would consist of

ourselves and a few friends, and the object of which would be to provide us

with a stable and binding organisation directing and adding interest to our

creative impulses in art and literature; or, to put it more plainly: each of us

would be pledged to present an original piece of work to the club once a

month,--either  a  poem,  a  treatise,  an  architectural  design,  or  a  musical

composition, upon which each of the others, in a friendly spirit, would have

to pass free and unrestrained criticism.

  We  thus  hoped,  by  means  of  mutual  correction,  to  be  able  both  to

stimulate and to chasten our creative impulses and, as a matter of fact, the

success  of  the  scheme  was  such  that  we  have  both  always  felt  a  sort  of

respectful attachment for the hour and the place at which it first took shape in

our minds.

  This attachment was very soon transformed into a rite; for we all agreed

to go, whenever it was possible to do so, once a year to that lonely spot near

Rolandseck,  where  on  that  summer's  day,  while  sitting  together,  lost  in

meditation,  we  were  suddenly  inspired  by  the  same  thought.  Frankly

speaking, the rules which were drawn up on the formation of the club were

never very strictly observed; but owing to the very fact that we had many sins

of omission on our conscience during our student-year in Bonn, when we

were once more on the banks of the Rhine, we firmly resolved not only to

observe our rule, but also to gratify our feelings and our sense of gratitude by

reverently visiting that spot near Rolandseck on the day appointed.

  It was, however, with some difficulty that we were able to carry our plansinto execution; for, on the very day we had selected for our excursion, the

large and lively students' association, which always hindered us in our flights,

did  their  utmost  to  put  obstacles  in  our  way  and  to  hold  us  back.  Our

association had organised a general holiday excursion to Rolandseck on the

very day my friend and I had fixed upon, the object of the outing being to

assemble all its members for the last time at the close of the half-year and to

send them home with pleasant recollections of their last hours together.

  The day was a glorious one; the weather was of the kind which, in our

climate at least, only falls to our lot in late summer: heaven and earth merged

harmoniously with one another, and, glowing wondrously in the sunshine,

autumn freshness blended with the blue expanse above. Arrayed in the bright

fantastic garb in which, amid the gloomy fashions now reigning, students

alone may indulge, we boarded a steamer which was gaily decorated in our

honour, and hoisted our flag on its mast. From both banks of the river there

came at intervals the sound of signal-guns, fired according to our orders, with

the view of acquainting both our host in Rolandseck and the inhabitants in the

neighbourhood with our approach. I shall not speak of the noisy journey from

the landing-stage, through the excited and expectant little place, nor shall I

refer  to  the  esoteric  jokes  exchanged  between  ourselves;  I  also  make  no

mention of a feast which became both wild and noisy, or of an extraordinary

musical  production  in  the  execution  of  which,  whether  as  soloists  or  as

chorus, we all ultimately had to share, and which I, as musical adviser of our

club, had not only had to rehearse, but was then forced to conduct. Towards

the end of this piece, which grew ever wilder and which was sung to ever

quicker time, I made a sign to my friend, and just as the last chord rang like a

yell  through  the  building,  he  and  I  vanished,  leaving  behind  us  a  raging

pandemonium.

  In a moment we were in the refreshing and breathless stillness of nature.

The shadows were already lengthening, the sun still shone steadily, though it

had sunk a good deal in the heavens, and from the green and glittering waves

of the Rhine a cool breeze was wafted over our hot faces. Our solemn rite

bound us only in so far as the latest hours of the day were concerned, and we

therefore determined to employ the last moments of clear daylight by giving

ourselves up to one of our many hobbies.

  At that time we were passionately fond of pistol-shooting, and both of us

in later years found the skill we had acquired as amateurs of great use in our

military career. Our club servant happened to know the somewhat distant andelevated spot which we used as a range, and had carried our pistols there in

advance. The spot lay near the upper border of the wood which covered the

lesser heights behind Rolandseck: it was a small uneven plateau, close to the

place we had consecrated in memory of its associations. On a wooded slope

alongside of our shooting-range there was a small piece of ground which had

been cleared of wood, and which made an ideal halting-place; from it one

could get a view of the Rhine over the tops of the trees and the brushwood, so

that the beautiful, undulating lines of the Seven Mountains and above all of

the Drachenfels bounded the horizon against the group of trees, while in the

centre  of  the  bow  formed  by  the  glistening  Rhine  itself  the  island  of

Nonnenw�rth stood out as if suspended in the river's arms. This was the

place which had become sacred to us through the dreams and plans we had

had in common, and to which we intended to withdraw, later in the evening,--

nay, to which we should be obliged to withdraw, if we wished to close the

day in accordance with the law we had imposed on ourselves.

  At one end of the little uneven plateau, and not very far away, there stood

the mighty trunk of an oak-tree, prominently visible against a background

quite  bare  of  trees  and  consisting  merely  of  low  undulating  hills  in  the

distance. Working together, we had once carved a pentagram in the side of

this tree-trunk. Years of exposure to rain and storm had slightly deepened the

channels we had cut, and the figure seemed a welcome target for our pistol-

practice. It was already late in the afternoon when we reached our improvised

range, and our oak-stump cast a long and attenuated shadow across the barren

heath. All was still: thanks to the lofty trees at our feet, we were unable to

catch a glimpse of the valley of the Rhine below. The peacefulness of the

spot  seemed  only  to  intensify  the  loudness  of  our  pistol-shots--and  I  had

scarcely fired my second barrel at the pentagram when I felt some one lay

hold of my arm and noticed that my friend had also some one beside him who

had interrupted his loading.

  Turning  sharply  on  my  heels  I  found  myself  face  to  face  with  an

astonished old gentleman, and felt what must have been a very powerful dog

make a lunge at my back. My friend had been approached by a somewhat

younger man than I had; but before we could give expression to our surprise

the older of the two interlopers burst forth in the following threatening and

heated strain: "No! no!" he called to us, "no duels must be fought here, but

least of all must you young students fight one. Away with these pistols and

compose yourselves. Be reconciled, shake hands! What?--and are you the saltof the earth, the intelligence of the future, the seed of our hopes--and are you

not even able to emancipate yourselves from the insane code of honour and

its violent regulations? I will not cast any aspersions on your hearts, but your

heads certainly do you no credit. You, whose youth is watched over by the

wisdom  of  Greece  and  Rome,  and  whose  youthful  spirits,  at  the  cost  of

enormous pains, have been flooded with the light of the sages and heroes of

antiquity,--can you not refrain from making the code of knightly honour--that

is  to  say,  the  code  of  folly  and  brutality--the  guiding  principle  of  your

conduct?--Examine it rationally once and for all, and reduce it to plain terms;

lay its pitiable narrowness bare, and let it be the touchstone, not of your

hearts but of your minds. If you do not regret it then, it will merely show that

your head is not fitted for work in a sphere where great gifts of discrimination

are  needful  in  order  to  burst  the  bonds  of  prejudice,  and  where  a  well-

balanced understanding is necessary for the purpose of distinguishing right

from wrong, even when the difference between them lies deeply hidden and

is not, as in this case, so ridiculously obvious. In that case, therefore, my lads,

try to go through life in some other honourable manner; join the army or

learn a handicraft that pays its way."

  To this rough, though admittedly just, flood of eloquence, we replied with

some irritation, interrupting each other continually in so doing: "In the first

place, you are mistaken concerning the main point; for we are not here to

fight a duel at all; but rather to practise pistol-shooting. Secondly, you do not

appear to know how a real duel is conducted;--do you suppose that we should

have  faced  each  other  in  this  lonely  spot,  like  two  highwaymen,  without

seconds or doctors, etc. etc.? Thirdly, with regard to the question of duelling,

we  each  have  our  own  opinions,  and  do  not  require  to  be  waylaid  and

surprised by the sort of instruction you may feel disposed to give us."

  This reply, which was certainly not polite, made a bad impression upon

the old man. At first, when he heard that we were not about to fight a duel, he

surveyed  us  more  kindly:  but  when  we  reached  the  last  passage  of  our

speech, he seemed so vexed that he growled. When, however, we began to

speak of our point of view, he quickly caught hold of his companion, turned

sharply round, and cried to us in bitter tones: "People should not have points

of view, but thoughts!" And then his companion added: "Be respectful when

a man such as this even makes mistakes!"

  Meanwhile, my friend, who had reloaded, fired a shot at the pentagram,

after having cried: "Look out!" This sudden report behind his back made theold man savage; once more he turned round and looked sourly at my friend,

after which he said to his companion in a feeble voice: "What shall we do?

These young men will be the death of me with their firing."--"You should

know,"  said  the  younger  man,  turning  to  us,  "that  your  noisy  pastimes

amount,  as  it  happens  on  this  occasion,  to  an  attempt  upon  the  life  of

philosophy. You observe this venerable man,--he is in a position to beg you

to desist from firing here. And when such a man begs----" "Well, his request

is generally granted," the old man interjected, surveying us sternly.

  As a matter of fact, we did not know what to make of the whole matter;

we could not understand what our noisy pastimes could have in common with

philosophy;  nor  could  we  see  why,  out  of  regard  for  polite  scruples,  we

should  abandon  our  shooting-range,  and  at  this  moment  we  may  have

appeared somewhat undecided and perturbed. The companion noticing our

momentary discomfiture, proceeded to explain the matter to us.

  "We are compelled," he said, "to linger in this immediate neighbourhood

for an hour or so; we have a rendezvous here. An eminent friend of this

eminent man is to meet us here this evening; and we had actually selected

this peaceful spot, with its few benches in the midst of the wood, for the

meeting.  It  would  really  be  most  unpleasant  if,  owing  to  your  continual

pistol-practice,  we  were  to  be  subjected  to  an  unending  series  of  shocks;

surely your own feelings will tell you that it is impossible for you to continue

your firing when you hear that he who has selected this quiet and isolated

place for a meeting with a friend is one of our most eminent philosophers."

  This explanation only succeeded in perturbing us the more; for we saw a

danger threatening us which was even greater than the loss of our shooting-

range, and we asked eagerly, "Where is this quiet spot? Surely not to the left

here, in the wood?"

  "That is the very place."

  "But this evening that place belongs to us," my friend interposed. "We

must have it," we cried together.

  Our long-projected celebration seemed at that moment more important

than  all  the  philosophies  of  the  world,  and  we  gave  such  vehement  and

animated utterance to our sentiments that in view of the incomprehensible

nature of our claims we must have cut a somewhat ridiculous figure. At any

rate, our philosophical interlopers regarded us with expressions of amused

inquiry, as if they expected us to proffer some sort of apology. But we were

silent, for we wished above all to keep our secret.  Thus we stood facing one another in silence, while the sunset dyed the

tree-tops a ruddy gold. The philosopher contemplated the sun, his companion

contemplated him, and we turned our eyes towards our nook in the woods

which to-day we seemed in such great danger of losing. A feeling of sullen

anger took possession of us. What is philosophy, we asked ourselves, if it

prevents a man from being by himself or from enjoying the select company

of a friend,--in sooth, if it prevents him from becoming a philosopher? For we

regarded  the  celebration  of  our  rite  as  a  thoroughly  philosophical

performance. In celebrating it we wished to form plans and resolutions for the

future, by means of quiet reflections we hoped to light upon an idea which

would once again help us to form and gratify our spirit in the future, just as

that former idea had done during our boyhood. The solemn act derived its

very significance from this resolution, that nothing definite was to be done,

we were only to be alone, and to sit still and meditate, as we had done five

years before when we had each been inspired with the same thought. It was to

be a silent solemnisation, all reminiscence and all future; the present was to

be as a hyphen between the two. And fate, now unfriendly, had just stepped

into our magic circle--and we knew not how to dismiss her;--the very unusual

character of the circumstances filled us with mysterious excitement.

  Whilst we stood thus in silence for some time, divided into two hostile

groups, the clouds above waxed ever redder and the evening seemed to grow

more  peaceful  and  mild;  we  could  almost  fancy  we  heard  the  regular

breathing  of  nature  as  she  put  the  final  touches  to  her  work  of  art--the

glorious day we had just enjoyed; when, suddenly, the calm evening air was

rent by a confused and boisterous cry of joy which seemed to come from the

Rhine. A number of voices could be heard in the distance--they were those of

our fellow-students who by that time must have taken to the Rhine in small

boats. It occurred to us that we should be missed and that we should also miss

something:  almost  simultaneously  my  friend  and  I  raised  our  pistols:  our

shots were echoed back to us, and with their echo there came from the valley

the sound of a well-known cry intended as a signal of identification. For our

passion for shooting had brought us both repute and ill-repute in our club. At

the  same  time  we  were  conscious  that  our  behaviour  towards  the  silent

philosophical couple had been exceptionally ungentlemanly; they had been

quietly contemplating us for some time, and when we fired the shock made

them draw close up to each other. We hurried up to them, and each in our

turn cried out: "Forgive us. That was our last shot, and it was intended for ourfriends on the Rhine. They have understood us, do you hear? If you insist

upon having that place among the trees, grant us at least the permission to

recline there also. You will find a number of benches on the spot: we shall

not disturb you; we shall sit quite still and shall not utter a word: but it is now

past seven o'clock and we must go there at once.

  "That sounds more mysterious than it is," I added after a pause; "we have

made a solemn vow to spend this coming hour on that ground, and there were

reasons  for  the  vow.  The  spot  is  sacred  to  us,  owing  to  some  pleasant

associations, it must also inaugurate a good future for us. We shall therefore

endeavour to leave you with no disagreeable recollections of our meeting--

even though we have done much to perturb and frighten you."

  The philosopher was silent; his companion, however, said: "Our promises

and plans unfortunately compel us not only to remain, but also to spend the

same hour on the spot you have selected. It is left for us to decide whether

fate  or  perhaps  a  spirit  has  been  responsible  for  this  extraordinary

coincidence."

    "Besides, my friend," said the philosopher, "I am not half so displeased

with these warlike youngsters as I was. Did you observe how quiet they were

a moment ago, when we were contemplating the sun? They neither spoke nor

smoked, they stood stone still, I even believe they meditated."

  Turning suddenly in our direction, he said: "Were you meditating? Just

tell me about it as we proceed in the direction of our common trysting-place."

We took a few steps together and went down the slope into the warm balmy

air of the woods where it was already much darker. On the way my friend

openly revealed his thoughts to the philosopher, he confessed how much he

had feared that perhaps to-day for the first time a philosopher was about to

stand in the way of his philosophising.

  The sage laughed. "What? You were afraid a philosopher would prevent

your  philosophising?  This  might  easily  happen:  and  you  have  not  yet

experienced  such  a  thing?  Has  your  university  life  been  free  from

experience? You surely attend lectures on philosophy?"

  This question discomfited us; for, as a matter of fact, there had been no

element  of  philosophy  in  our  education  up  to  that  time.  In  those  days,

moreover,  we  fondly  imagined  that  everybody  who  held  the  post  and

possessed  the  dignity  of  a  philosopher  must  perforce  be  one:  we  were

inexperienced and badly informed. We frankly admitted that we had not yet

belonged to any philosophical college, but that we would certainly make upfor lost time.

  "Then  what,"  he  asked,  "did  you  mean  when  you  spoke  of

philosophising?" Said I, "We are at a loss for a definition. But to all intents

and purposes we meant this, that we wished to make earnest endeavours to

consider the best possible means of becoming men of culture." "That is a

good deal and at the same time very little," growled the philosopher; "just

you think the matter over. Here are our benches, let us discuss the question

exhaustively: I shall not disturb your meditations with regard to how you are

to become men of culture. I wish you success and--points of view, as in your

duelling questions; brand-new, original, and enlightened points of view. The

philosopher does not wish to prevent your philosophising: but refrain at least

from  disconcerting  him  with  your  pistol-shots.  Try  to  imitate  the

Pythagoreans to-day: they, as servants of a true philosophy, had to remain

silent for five years--possibly you may also be able to remain silent for five

times fifteen minutes, as servants of your own future culture, about which

you seem so concerned."

  We had reached our destination: the solemnisation of our rite began. As

on the previous occasion, five years ago, the Rhine was once more flowing

beneath a light mist, the sky seemed bright and the woods exhaled the same

fragrance.  We  took  our  places  on  the  farthest  corner  of  the  most  distant

bench; sitting there we were almost concealed, and neither the philosopher

nor his companion could see our faces. We were alone: when the sound of the

philosopher's voice reached us, it had become so blended with the rustling

leaves  and  with  the  buzzing  murmur  of  the  myriads  of  living  things

inhabiting the wooded height, that it almost seemed like the music of nature;

as a sound it resembled nothing more than a distant monotonous plaint. We

were indeed undisturbed.

  Some  time  elapsed  in  this  way,  and  while  the  glow  of  sunset  grew

steadily paler the recollection of our youthful undertaking in the cause of

culture waxed ever more vivid. It seemed to us as if we owed the greatest

debt of gratitude to that little society we had founded; for it had done more

than merely supplement our public school training; it had actually been the

only fruitful society we had had, and within its frame we even placed our

public school life, as a purely isolated factor helping us in our general efforts

to attain to culture.

  We knew this, that, thanks to our little society, no thought of embracing

any particular career had ever entered our minds in those days. The all toofrequent exploitation of youth by the State, for its own purposes--that is to

say, so that it may rear useful officials as quickly as possible and guarantee

their  unconditional  obedience  to  it  by  means  of  excessively  severe

examinations--had remained quite foreign to our education. And to show how

little we had been actuated by thoughts of utility or by the prospect of speedy

advancement and rapid success, on that day we were struck by the comforting

consideration that, even then, we had not yet decided what we should be--we

had not even troubled ourselves at all on this head. Our little society had

sown the seeds of this happy indifference in our souls and for it alone we

were  prepared  to  celebrate  the  anniversary  of  its  foundation  with  hearty

gratitude. I have already pointed out, I think, that in the eyes of the present

age, which is so intolerant of anything that is not useful, such purposeless

enjoyment of the moment, such a lulling of one's self in the cradle of the

present, must seem almost incredible and at all events blameworthy. How

useless we were! And how proud we were of being useless! We used even to

quarrel with each other as to which of us should have the glory of being the

more useless. We wished to attach no importance to anything, to have strong

views about nothing, to aim at nothing; we wanted to take no thought for the

morrow,  and  desired  no  more  than  to  recline  comfortably  like  good-for-

nothings on the threshold of the present; and we did--bless us!

  --That, ladies and gentlemen, was our standpoint then!--

    Absorbed in these reflections, I was just about to give an answer to the

question  of  the  future  of  our  Educational  Institutions  in  the  same  self-

sufficient way, when it gradually dawned upon me that the "natural music,"

coming  from  the  philosopher's  bench  had  lost  its  original  character  and

travelled  to  us  in  much  more  piercing  and  distinct  tones  than  before.

Suddenly I became aware that I was listening, that I was eavesdropping, and

was passionately interested, with both ears keenly alive to every sound. I

nudged  my  friend  who  was  evidently  somewhat  tired,  and  I  whispered:

"Don't fall asleep! There is something for us to learn over there. It applies to

us, even though it be not meant for us."

  For instance, I heard the younger of the two men defending himself with

great  animation  while  the  philosopher  rebuked  him  with  ever  increasing

vehemence.  "You  are  unchanged,"  he  cried  to  him,  "unfortunately

unchanged. It is quite incomprehensible to me how you can still be the same

as you were seven years ago, when I saw you for the last time and left you

with  so  much  misgiving.  I  fear  I  must  once  again  divest  you,  howeverreluctantly,  of  the  skin  of  modern  culture  which  you  have  donned

meanwhile;--and what do I find beneath it? The same immutable 'intelligible'

character forsooth, according to Kant; but unfortunately the same unchanged

'intellectual'  character,  too--which  may  also  be  a  necessity,  though  not  a

comforting one. I ask myself to what purpose have I lived as a philosopher,

if,  possessed  as  you  are  of  no  mean  intelligence  and  a  genuine  thirst  for

knowledge, all the years you have spent in my company have left no deeper

impression upon you. At present you are behaving as if you had not even

heard  the  cardinal  principle  of  all  culture,  which  I  went  to  such  pains  to

inculcate  upon  you  during  our  former  intimacy.  Tell  me,--what  was  that

principle?"

  "I remember," replied the scolded pupil, "you used to say no one would

strive to attain to culture if he knew how incredibly small the number of

really cultured people actually is, and can ever be. And even this number of

really cultured people would not be possible if a prodigious multitude, from

reasons opposed to their nature and only led on by an alluring delusion, did

not devote themselves to education. It were therefore a mistake publicly to

reveal  the  ridiculous  disproportion  between  the  number  of  really  cultured

people and the enormous magnitude of the educational apparatus. Here lies

the whole secret of culture--namely, that an innumerable host of men struggle

to achieve it and work hard to that end, ostensibly in their own interests,

whereas at bottom it is only in order that it may be possible for the few to

attain to it."

  "That is the principle," said the philosopher,--"and yet you could so far

forget yourself as to believe that you are one of the few? This thought has

occurred  to  you--I  can  see.  That,  however,  is  the  result  of  the  worthless

character of modern education. The rights of genius are being democratised

in order that people may be relieved of the labour of acquiring culture, and

their need of it. Every one wants if possible to recline in the shade of the tree

planted by genius, and to escape the dreadful necessity of working for him, so

that his procreation may be made possible. What? Are you too proud to be a

teacher? Do you despise the thronging multitude of learners? Do you speak

contemptuously of the teacher's calling? And, aping my mode of life, would

you fain live in solitary seclusion, hostilely isolated from that multitude? Do

you suppose that you can reach at one bound what I ultimately had to win for

myself only after long and determined struggles, in order even to be able to

live  like  a  philosopher?  And  do  you  not  fear  that  solitude  will  wreak  itsvengeance upon you? Just try living the life of a hermit of culture. One must

be blessed with overflowing wealth in order to live for the good of all on

one's own resources! Extraordinary youngsters! They felt it incumbent upon

them  to  imitate  what  is  precisely  most  difficult  and  most  high,--what  is

possible only to the master, when they, above all, should know how difficult

and  dangerous  this  is,  and  how  many  excellent  gifts  may  be  ruined  by

attempting it!"

  "I will conceal nothing from you, sir," the companion replied. "I have

heard too much from your lips at odd times and have been too long in your

company to be able to surrender myself entirely to our present system of

education  and  instruction.  I  am  too  painfully  conscious  of  the  disastrous

errors and abuses to which you used to call my attention--though I very well

know that I am not strong enough to hope for any success were I to struggle

ever  so  valiantly  against  them.  I  was  overcome  by  a  feeling  of  general

discouragement; my recourse to solitude was the result neither of pride nor

arrogance. I would fain describe to you what I take to be the nature of the

educational questions now attracting such enormous and pressing attention. It

seemed to me that I must recognise two main directions in the forces at work-

-two seemingly antagonistic tendencies, equally deleterious in their action,

and ultimately combining to produce their results: a striving to achieve the

greatest possible expansion of education on the one hand, and a tendency to

minimise and weaken it on the other. The first-named would, for various

reasons, spread learning among the greatest number of people; the second

would compel education to renounce its highest, noblest and sublimest claims

in order to subordinate itself to some other department of life--such as the

service of the State.

  "I believe I have already hinted at the quarter in which the cry for the

greatest  possible  expansion  of  education  is  most  loudly  raised.  This

expansion belongs to the most beloved of the dogmas of modern political

economy.  As  much  knowledge  and  education  as  possible;  therefore  the

greatest possible supply and demand--hence as much happiness as possible:--

that  is  the  formula.  In  this  case  utility  is  made  the  object  and  goal  of

education,--utility in the sense of gain--the greatest possible pecuniary gain.

In the quarter now under consideration culture would be defined as that point

of vantage which enables one to 'keep in the van of one's age,' from which

one can see all the easiest and best roads to wealth, and with which one

controls  all  the  means  of  communication  between  men  and  nations.  Thepurpose of education, according to this scheme, would be to rear the most

'current' men possible,--'current' being used here in the sense in which it is

applied to the coins of the realm. The greater the number of such men, the

happier a nation will be; and this precisely is the purpose of our modern

educational institutions: to help every one, as far as his nature will allow, to

become 'current'; to develop him so that his particular degree of knowledge

and science may yield him the greatest possible amount of happiness and

pecuniary gain. Every one must be able to form some sort of estimate of

himself; he must know how much he may reasonably expect from life. The

'bond between intelligence and property' which this point of view postulates

has almost the force of a moral principle. In this quarter all culture is loathed

which isolates, which sets goals beyond gold and gain, and which requires

time: it is customary to dispose of such eccentric tendencies in education as

systems  of  'Higher  Egotism,'  or  of  'Immoral  Culture--Epicureanism.'

According  to  the  morality  reigning  here,  the  demands  are  quite  different;

what  is  required  above  all  is  'rapid  education,'  so  that  a  money-earning

creature may be produced with all speed; there is even a desire to make this

education so thorough that a creature may be reared that will be able to earn a

great deal of money. Men are allowed only the precise amount of culture

which is compatible with the interests of gain; but that amount, at least, is

expected from them. In short: mankind has a necessary right to happiness on

earth--that is why culture is necessary--but on that account alone!"

  "I must just say something here," said the philosopher. "In the case of the

view you have described so clearly, there arises the great and awful danger

that at some time or other the great masses may overleap the middle classes

and spring headlong into this earthly bliss. That is what is now called 'the

social question.' It might seem to these masses that education for the greatest

number of men was only a means to the earthly bliss of the few: the 'greatest

possible expansion of education' so enfeebles education that it can no longer

confer  privileges  or  inspire  respect.  The  most  general  form  of  culture  is

simply barbarism. But I do not wish to interrupt your discussion."

  The  companion  continued:  "There  are  yet  other  reasons,  besides  this

beloved  economical  dogma,  for  the  expansion  of  education  that  is  being

striven after so valiantly everywhere. In some countries the fear of religious

oppression is so general, and the dread of its results so marked, that people in

all classes of society long for culture and eagerly absorb those elements of it

which are supposed to scatter the religious instincts. Elsewhere the State, inits turn, strives here and there for its own preservation, after the greatest

possible expansion of education, because it always feels strong enough to

bring  the  most  determined  emancipation,  resulting  from  culture,  under  its

yoke,  and  readily  approves  of  everything  which  tends  to  extend  culture,

provided that it be of service to its officials or soldiers, but in the main to

itself, in its competition with other nations. In this case, the foundations of a

State must be sufficiently broad and firm to constitute a fitting counterpart to

the complicated arches of culture which it supports, just as in the first case

the traces of some former religious tyranny must still be felt for a people to

be driven to such desperate remedies. Thus, wherever I hear the masses raise

the cry for an expansion of education, I am wont to ask myself whether it is

stimulated by a greedy lust of gain and property, by the memory of a former

religious persecution, or by the prudent egotism of the State itself.

  "On the other hand, it seemed to me that there was yet another tendency,

not so clamorous, perhaps, but quite as forcible, which, hailing from various

quarters,  was  animated  by  a  different  desire,--the  desire  to  minimise  and

weaken education.

  "In  all  cultivated  circles  people  are  in  the  habit  of  whispering  to  one

another words something after this style: that it is a general fact that, owing to

the present frantic exploitation of the scholar in the service of his science, his

education becomes every day more accidental and more uncertain. For the

study of science has been extended to such interminable lengths that he who,

though  not  exceptionally  gifted,  yet  possesses  fair  abilities,  will  need  to

devote himself exclusively to one branch and ignore all others if he ever wish

to achieve anything in his work. Should he then elevate himself above the

herd by means of his speciality, he still remains one of them in regard to all

else,--that is to say, in regard to all the most important things in life. Thus, a

specialist in science gets to resemble nothing so much as a factory workman

who spends his whole life in turning one particular screw or handle on a

certain  instrument  or  machine,  at  which  occupation  he  acquires  the  most

consummate skill. In Germany, where we know how to drape such painful

facts with the glorious garments of fancy, this narrow specialisation on the

part of our learned men is even admired, and their ever greater deviation from

the path of true culture is regarded as a moral phenomenon. 'Fidelity in small

things,' 'dogged faithfulness,' become expressions of highest eulogy, and the

lack of culture outside the speciality is flaunted abroad as a sign of noble

sufficiency.  "For centuries it has been an understood thing that one alluded to scholars

alone when one spoke of cultured men; but experience tells us that it would

be difficult to find any necessary relation between the two classes to-day. For

at present the exploitation of a man for the purpose of science is accepted

everywhere without the slightest scruple. Who still ventures to ask, What

may be the value of a science which consumes its minions in this vampire

fashion? The division of labour in science is practically struggling towards

the same goal which religions in certain parts of the world are consciously

striving after,--that is to say, towards the decrease and even the destruction of

learning. That, however, which, in the case of certain religions, is a perfectly

justifiable  aim,  both  in  regard  to  their  origin  and  their  history,  can  only

amount to self-immolation when transferred to the realm of science. In all

matters of a general and serious nature, and above all, in regard to the highest

philosophical problems, we have now already reached a point at which the

scientific man, as such, is no longer allowed to speak. On the other hand, that

adhesive  and  tenacious  stratum  which  has  now  filled  up  the  interstices

between the sciences--Journalism--believes it has a mission to fulfil here, and

this it does, according to its own particular lights--that is to say, as its name

implies, after the fashion of a day-labourer.

  "It is precisely in journalism that the two tendencies combine and become

one. The expansion and the diminution of education here join hands. The

newspaper actually steps into the place of culture, and he who, even as a

scholar, wishes to voice any claim for education, must avail himself of this

viscous  stratum  of  communication  which  cements  the  seams  between  all

forms of life, all classes, all arts, and all sciences, and which is as firm and

reliable as news paper is, as a rule. In the newspaper the peculiar educational

aims  of  the  present  culminate,  just  as  the  journalist,  the  servant  of  the

moment, has stepped into the place of the genius, of the leader for all time, of

the deliverer from the tyranny of the moment. Now, tell me, distinguished

master, what hopes could I still have in a struggle against the general topsy-

turvification of all genuine aims for education; with what courage can I, a

single teacher, step forward, when I know that the moment any seeds of real

culture  are  sown,  they  will  be  mercilessly  crushed  by  the  roller  of  this

pseudo-culture? Imagine how useless the most energetic work on the part of

the individual teacher must be, who would fain lead a pupil back into the

distant and evasive Hellenic world and to the real home of culture, when in

less than an hour, that same pupil will have recourse to a newspaper, thelatest novel, or one of those learned books, the very style of which already

bears the revolting impress of modern barbaric culture----"

  "Now,  silence  a  minute!"  interjected  the  philosopher  in  a  strong  and

sympathetic voice. "I understand you now, and ought never to have spoken so

crossly to you. You are altogether right, save in your despair. I shall now

proceed to say a few words of consolation."

                                  SECOND LECTURE.

    (Delivered on the 6th of February 1872.)

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--Those among you whom I now have the

pleasure of addressing for the first time and whose only knowledge of my

first  lecture  has  been  derived  from  reports  will,  I  hope,  not  mind  being

introduced here into the middle of a dialogue which I had begun to recount

on the last occasion, and the last points of which I must now recall. The

philosopher's young companion was just pleading openly and confidentially

with his distinguished tutor, and apologising for having so far renounced his

calling as a teacher in order to spend his days in comfortless solitude. No

suspicion  of  superciliousness  or  arrogance  had  induced  him  to  form  this

resolve.

  "I  have  heard  too  much  from  your  lips  at  various  times,"  the

straightforward  pupil  said,  "and  have  been  too  long  in  your  company,  to

surrender myself blindly to our present systems of education and instruction.

I am too painfully conscious of the disastrous errors and abuses to which you

were wont to call my attention; and yet I know that I am far from possessing

the  requisite  strength  to  meet  with  success,  however  valiantly  I  might

struggle to shatter the bulwarks of this would-be culture. I was overcome by a

general feeling of depression: my recourse to solitude was not arrogance or

superciliousness." Whereupon, to account for his behaviour, he described the

general  character  of  modern  educational  methods  so  vividly  that  the

philosopher could not help interrupting him in a voice full of sympathy, and

crying words of comfort to him.

  "Now, silence for a minute, my poor friend," he cried; "I can more easily

understand you now, and should not have lost my patience with you. You are

altogether right, save in your despair. I shall now proceed to say a few words

of comfort to you. How long do you suppose the state of education in the

schools of our time, which seems to weigh so heavily upon you, will last? I

shall not conceal my views on this point from you: its time is over; its days

are counted. The first who will dare to be quite straightforward in this respectwill  hear  his  honesty  re-echoed  back  to  him  by  thousands  of  courageous

souls. For, at bottom, there is a tacit understanding between the more nobly

gifted and more warmly disposed men of the present day. Every one of them

knows what he has had to suffer from the condition of culture in schools;

every one of them would fain protect his offspring from the need of enduring

similar drawbacks, even though he himself was compelled to submit to them.

If these feelings are never quite honestly expressed, however, it is owing to a

sad want of spirit among modern pedagogues. These lack real initiative; there

are too few practical men among them--that is to say, too few who happen to

have  good  and  new  ideas,  and  who  know  that  real  genius  and  the  real

practical mind must necessarily come together in the same individuals, whilst

the sober practical men have no ideas and therefore fall short in practice.

  "Let any one examine the pedagogic literature of the present; he who is

not shocked at its utter poverty of spirit and its ridiculously awkward antics is

beyond being spoiled. Here our philosophy must not begin with wonder but

with dread; he who feels no dread at this point must be asked not to meddle

with pedagogic questions. The reverse, of course, has been the rule up to the

present; those who were terrified ran away filled with embarrassment as you

did, my poor friend, while the sober and fearless ones spread their heavy

hands over the most delicate technique that has ever existed in art--over the

technique of education. This, however, will not be possible much longer; at

some time or other the upright man will appear, who will not only have the

good ideas I speak of, but who in order to work at their realisation, will dare

to break with all that exists at present: he may by means of a wonderful

example  achieve  what  the  broad  hands,  hitherto  active,  could  not  even

imitate--then people will everywhere begin to draw comparisons; then men

will at least be able to perceive a contrast and will be in a position to reflect

upon its causes, whereas, at present, so many still believe, in perfect good

faith, that heavy hands are a necessary factor in pedagogic work."

  "My dear master," said the younger man, "I wish you could point to one

single example which would assist me in seeing the soundness of the hopes

which  you  so  heartily  raise  in  me.  We  are  both  acquainted  with  public

schools;  do  you  think,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  these  institutions

anything  may  be  done  by  means  of  honesty  and  good  and  new  ideas  to

abolish the tenacious and antiquated customs now extant? In this quarter, it

seems to me, the battering-rams of an attacking party will have to meet with

no solid wall, but with the most fatal of stolid and slippery principles. Theleader of the assault has no visible and tangible opponent to crush, but rather

a creature in disguise that can transform itself into a hundred different shapes

and, in each of these, slip out of his grasp, only in order to reappear and to

confound  its  enemy  by  cowardly  surrenders  and  feigned  retreats.  It  was

precisely the public schools which drove me into despair and solitude, simply

because I feel that if the struggle here leads to victory all other educational

institutions must give in; but that, if the reformer be forced to abandon his

cause here, he may as well give up all hope in regard to every other scholastic

question. Therefore, dear master, enlighten me concerning the public schools;

what can we hope for in the way of their abolition or reform?"

  "I also hold the question of public schools to be as important as you do,"

the philosopher replied. "All other educational institutions must fix their aims

in accordance with those of the public school system; whatever errors of

judgment  it  may  suffer  from,  they  suffer  from  also,  and  if  it  were  ever

purified and rejuvenated, they would be purified and rejuvenated too. The

universities can no longer lay claim to this importance as centres of influence,

seeing that, as they now stand, they are at least, in one important aspect, only

a kind of annex to the public school system, as I shall shortly point out to

you. For the moment, let us consider, together, what to my mind constitutes

the very hopeful struggle of the two possibilities: either that the motley and

evasive  spirit  of  public  schools  which  has  hitherto  been  fostered,  will

completely  vanish,  or  that  it  will  have  to  be  completely  purified  and

rejuvenated. And in order that I may not shock you with general propositions,

let us first try to recall one of those public school experiences which we have

all  had,  and  from  which  we  have  all  suffered.  Under  severe  examination

what, as a matter of fact, is the present system of teaching German in public

schools?

  "I shall first of all tell you what it should be. Everybody speaks and writes

German  as  thoroughly  badly  as  it  is  just  possible  to  do  so  in  an  age  of

newspaper German: that is why the growing youth who happens to be both

noble and gifted has to be taken by force and put under the glass shade of

good taste and of severe linguistic discipline. If this is not possible, I would

prefer in future that Latin be spoken; for I am ashamed of a language so

bungled and vitiated.

  "What  would  be  the  duty  of  a  higher  educational  institution,  in  this

respect,  if  not  this--namely,  with  authority  and  dignified  severity  to  put

youths, neglected, as far as their own language is concerned, on the rightpath, and to cry to them: 'Take your own language seriously! He who does

not regard this matter as a sacred duty does not possess even the germ of a

higher culture. From your attitude in this matter, from your treatment of your

mother-tongue, we can judge how highly or how lowly you esteem art, and to

what  extent  you  are  related  to  it.  If  you  notice  no  physical  loathing  in

yourselves when you meet with certain words and tricks of speech in our

journalistic  jargon,  cease  from  striving  after  culture;  for  here  in  your

immediate  vicinity,  at  every  moment  of  your  life,  while  you  are  either

speaking or writing, you have a touchstone for testing how difficult, how

stupendous, the task of the cultured man is, and how very improbable it must

be that many of you will ever attain to culture.'

  "In accordance with the spirit of this address, the teacher of German at a

public school would be forced to call his pupil's attention to thousands of

details, and with the absolute certainty of good taste, to forbid their using

such words and expressions, for instance, as: 'beanspruchen,' 'vereinnahmen,'

'einer Sache Rechnung tragen,' 'die Initiative ergreifen,'

'selbstverst�ndlich,'[3]  etc.,  cum  t�dio  in  infinitum.  The  same  teacher

would also have to take our classical authors and show, line for line, how

carefully and with what precision every expression has to be chosen when a

writer has the correct feeling in his heart and has before his eyes a perfect

conception of all he is writing. He would necessarily urge his pupils, time and

again, to express the same thought ever more happily; nor would he have to

abate in rigour until the less gifted in his class had contracted an unholy fear

of their language, and the others had developed great enthusiasm for it.

  "Here  then  is  a  task  for  so-called  'formal'  education[4]  [the  education

tending to develop the mental faculties, as opposed to 'material' education,[5]

which  is  intended  to  deal  only  with  the  acquisition  of  facts,  e.g.  history,

mathematics, etc.], and one of the utmost value: but what do we find in the

public school--that is to say, in the head-quarters of formal education? He

who understands how to apply what he has heard here will also know what to

think of the modern public school as a so-called educational institution. He

will  discover,  for  instance,  that  the  public  school,  according  to  its

fundamental principles, does not educate for the purposes of culture, but for

the purposes of scholarship; and, further, that of late it seems to have adopted

a  course  which  indicates  rather  that  it  has  even  discarded  scholarship  in

favour of journalism as the object of its exertions. This can be clearly seen

from the way in which German is taught.  "Instead  of  that  purely  practical  method  of  instruction  by  which  the

teacher accustoms his pupils to severe self-discipline in their own language,

we  find  everywhere  the  rudiments  of  a  historico-scholastic  method  of

teaching the mother-tongue: that is to say, people deal with it as if it were a

dead language and as if the present and future were under no obligations to it

whatsoever. The historical method has become so universal in our time, that

even the living body of the language is sacrificed for the sake of anatomical

study. But this is precisely where culture begins--namely, in understanding

how to treat the quick as something vital, and it is here too that the mission of

the cultured teacher begins: in suppressing the urgent claims of 'historical

interests' wherever it is above all necessary to do properly and not merely to

know properly. Our mother-tongue, however, is a domain in which the pupil

must learn how to do properly, and to this practical end, alone, the teaching

of German is essential in our scholastic establishments. The historical method

may  certainly  be  a  considerably  easier  and  more  comfortable  one  for  the

teacher; it also seems to be compatible with a much lower grade of ability

and, in general, with a smaller display of energy and will on his part. But we

shall find that this observation holds good in every department of pedagogic

life: the simpler and more comfortable method always masquerades in the

disguise of grand pretensions and stately titles; the really practical side, the

doing, which should belong to culture and which, at bottom, is the more

difficult  side,  meets  only  with  disfavour  and  contempt.  That  is  why  the

honest man must make himself and others quite clear concerning this quid

pro quo.

  "Now, apart from these learned incentives to a study of the language,

what is there besides which the German teacher is wont to offer? How does

he reconcile the spirit of his school with the spirit of the few that Germany

can claim who are really cultured,--i.e. with the spirit of its classical poets

and artists? This is a dark and thorny sphere, into which one cannot even bear

a light without dread; but even here we shall conceal nothing from ourselves;

for sooner or later the whole of it will have to be reformed. In the public

school, the repulsive impress of our �sthetic journalism is stamped upon the

still unformed minds of youths. Here, too, the teacher sows the seeds of that

crude  and  wilful  misinterpretation  of  the  classics,  which  later  on  disports

itself as art-criticism, and which is nothing but bumptious barbarity. Here the

pupils learn to speak of our unique Schiller with the superciliousness of prigs;

here they are taught to smile at the noblest and most German of his works--atthe  Marquis  of  Posa,  at  Max  and  Thekla--at  these  smiles  German  genius

becomes incensed and a worthier posterity will blush.

  "The last department in which the German teacher in a public school is at

all active, which is often regarded as his sphere of highest activity, and is

here and there even considered the pinnacle of public school education, is the

so-called German composition. Owing to the very fact that in this department

it is almost always the most gifted pupils who display the greatest eagerness,

it ought to have been made clear how dangerously stimulating, precisely here,

the task of the teacher must be. German composition makes an appeal to the

individual, and the more strongly a pupil is conscious of his various qualities,

the more personally will he do his German composition. This 'personal doing'

is urged on with yet an additional fillip in some public schools by the choice

of the subject, the strongest proof of which is, in my opinion, that even in the

lower classes the non-pedagogic subject is set, by means of which the pupil is

led to give a description of his life and of his development. Now, one has

only to read the titles of the compositions set in a large number of public

schools to be convinced that probably the large majority of pupils have to

suffer  their  whole  lives,  through  no  fault  of  their  own,  owing  to  this

premature demand for personal work--for the unripe procreation of thoughts.

And how often are not all a man's subsequent literary performances but a sad

result of this pedagogic original sin against the intellect!

  "Let us only think of what takes place at such an age in the production of

such work. It is the first individual creation; the still undeveloped powers

tend for the first time to crystallise; the staggering sensation produced by the

demand  for  self-reliance  imparts  a  seductive  charm  to  these  early

performances, which is not only quite new, but which never returns. All the

daring of nature is hauled out of its depths; all vanities--no longer constrained

by mighty barriers--are allowed for the first time to assume a literary form:

the  young  man,  from  that  time  forward,  feels  as  if  he  had  reached  his

consummation as a being not only able, but actually invited, to speak and to

converse. The subject he selects obliges him either to express his judgment

upon  certain  poetical  works,  to  class  historical  persons  together  in  a

description  of  character,  to  discuss  serious  ethical  problems  quite

independently, or even to turn the searchlight inwards, to throw its rays upon

his own development and to make a critical report of himself: in short, a

whole world of reflection is spread out before the astonished young man who,

until then, had been almost unconscious, and is delivered up to him to bejudged.

  "Now let us try to picture the teacher's usual attitude towards these first

highly influential examples of original composition. What does he hold to be

most  reprehensible  in  this  class  of  work?  What  does  he  call  his  pupil's

attention  to?--To  all  excess  in  form  or  thought--that  is  to  say,  to  all  that

which, at their age, is essentially characteristic and individual. Their really

independent traits which, in response to this very premature excitation, can

manifest  themselves  only  in  awkwardness,  crudeness,  and  grotesque

features,--in short, their individuality is reproved and rejected by the teacher

in  favour  of  an  unoriginal  decent  average.  On  the  other  hand,  uniform

mediocrity gets peevish praise; for, as a rule, it is just the class of work likely

to bore the teacher thoroughly.

  "There  may  still  be  men  who  recognise  a  most  absurd  and  most

dangerous element of the public school curriculum in the whole farce of this

German composition. Originality is demanded here: but the only shape in

which it can manifest itself is rejected, and the 'formal' education that the

system takes for granted is attained to only by a very limited number of men

who complete it at a ripe age. Here everybody without exception is regarded

as  gifted  for  literature  and  considered  as  capable  of  holding  opinions

concerning the most important questions and people, whereas the one aim

which proper education should most zealously strive to achieve would be the

suppression  of  all  ridiculous  claims  to  independent  judgment,  and  the

inculcation upon young men of obedience to the sceptre of genius. Here a

pompous form of diction is taught in an age when every spoken or written

word is a piece of barbarism. Now let us consider, besides, the danger of

arousing the self-complacency which is so easily awakened in youths; let us

think how their vanity must be flattered when they see their literary reflection

for the first time in the mirror. Who, having seen all these effects at one

glance, could any longer doubt whether all the faults of our public, literary,

and artistic life were not stamped upon every fresh generation by the system

we are examining: hasty and vain production, the disgraceful manufacture of

books; complete want of style; the crude, characterless, or sadly swaggering

method of expression; the loss of every �sthetic canon; the voluptuousness

of  anarchy  and  chaos--in  short,  the  literary  peculiarities  of  both  our

journalism and our scholarship.

  "None  but  the  very  fewest  are  aware  that,  among  many  thousands,

perhaps only one is justified in describing himself as literary, and that allothers who at their own risk try to be so deserve to be met with Homeric

laughter by all competent men as a reward for every sentence they have ever

had printed;--for it is truly a spectacle meet for the gods to see a literary

Hephaistos limping forward who would pretend to help us to something. To

educate  men  to  earnest  and  inexorable  habits  and  views,  in  this  respect,

should be the highest aim of all mental training, whereas the general laisser

aller  of  the  'fine  personality'  can  be  nothing  else  than  the  hall-mark  of

barbarism. From what I have said, however, it must be clear that, at least in

the  teaching  of  German,  no  thought  is  given  to  culture;  something  quite

different  is  in  view,--namely,  the  production  of  the  afore-mentioned  'free

personality.'  And  so  long  as  German  public  schools  prepare  the  road  for

outrageous and irresponsible scribbling, so long as they do not regard the

immediate and practical discipline of speaking and writing as their most holy

duty, so long as they treat the mother-tongue as if it were only a necessary

evil or a dead body, I shall not regard these institutions as belonging to real

culture.

  "In regard to the language, what is surely least noticeable is any trace of

the  influence  of  classical  examples:  that  is  why,  on  the  strength  of  this

consideration alone, the so-called 'classical education' which is supposed to

be  provided  by  our  public  school,  strikes  me  as  something  exceedingly

doubtful and confused. For how could anybody, after having cast one glance

at those examples, fail to see the great earnestness with which the Greek and

the Roman regarded and treated his language, from his youth onwards--how

is it possible to mistake one's example on a point like this one?--provided, of

course, that the classical Hellenic and Roman world really did hover before

the educational plan of our public schools as the highest and most instructive

of  all  morals--a  fact  I  feel  very  much  inclined  to  doubt.  The  claim  put

forward by public schools concerning the 'classical education' they provide

seems to be more an awkward evasion than anything else; it is used whenever

there is any question raised as to the competency of the public schools to

impart  culture  and  to  educate.  Classical  education,  indeed!  It  sounds  so

dignified!  It  confounds  the  aggressor  and  staves  off  the  assault--for  who

could see to the bottom of this bewildering formula all at once? And this has

long been the customary strategy of the public school: from whichever side

the  war-cry  may  come,  it  writes  upon  its  shield--not  overloaded  with

honours--one of those confusing catchwords, such as: 'classical education,'

'formal  education,'  'scientific  education':--three  glorious  things  which  are,however,  unhappily  at  loggerheads,  not  only  with  themselves  but  among

themselves, and are such that, if they were compulsorily brought together,

would perforce bring forth a culture-monster. For a 'classical education' is

something  so  unheard  of,  difficult  and  rare,  and  exacts  such  complicated

talent,  that  only  ingenuousness  or  impudence  could  put  it  forward  as  an

attainable goal in our public schools. The words: 'formal education' belong to

that crude kind of unphilosophical phraseology which one should do one's

utmost to get rid of; for there is no such thing as 'the opposite of formal

education.' And he who regards 'scientific education' as the object of a public

school  thereby  sacrifices  'classical  education'  and  the  so-called  'formal

education,' at one stroke, as the scientific man and the cultured man belong to

two different spheres which, though coming together at times in the same

individual, are never reconciled.

  "If we compare all three of these would-be aims of the public school with

the actual facts to be observed in the present method of teaching German, we

see immediately what they really amount to in practice,--that is to say, only to

subterfuges for use in the fight and struggle for existence and, often enough,

mere means wherewith to bewilder an opponent. For we are unable to detect

any single feature in this teaching of German which in any way recalls the

example  of  classical  antiquity  and  its  glorious  methods  of  training  in

languages. 'Formal education,' however, which is supposed to be achieved by

this method of teaching German, has been shown to be wholly at the pleasure

of the 'free personality,' which is as good as saying that it is barbarism and

anarchy.  And  as  for  the  preparation  in  science,  which  is  one  of  the

consequences of this teaching, our Germanists will have to determine, in all

justice, how little these learned beginnings in public schools have contributed

to the splendour of their sciences, and how much the personality of individual

university professors has done so.--Put briefly: the public school has hitherto

neglected  its  most  important  and  most  urgent  duty  towards  the  very

beginning of all real culture, which is the mother-tongue; but in so doing it

has lacked the natural, fertile soil for all further efforts at culture. For only by

means of stern, artistic, and careful discipline and habit, in a language, can

the correct feeling for the greatness of our classical writers be strengthened.

Up to the present their recognition by the public schools has been owing

almost solely to the doubtful �sthetic hobbies of a few teachers or to the

massive  effects  of  certain  of  their  tragedies  and  novels.  But  everybody

should, himself, be aware of the difficulties of the language: he should havelearnt them from experience: after long seeking and struggling he must reach

the path our great poets trod in order to be able to realise how lightly and

beautifully they trod it, and how stiffly and swaggeringly the others follow at

their heels.

  "Only  by  means  of  such  discipline  can  the  young  man  acquire  that

physical loathing for the beloved and much-admired 'elegance' of style of our

newspaper  manufacturers  and  novelists,  and  for  the  'ornate  style'  of  our

literary men; by it alone is he irrevocably elevated at a stroke above a whole

host  of  absurd  questions  and  scruples,  such,  for  instance,  as  whether

Auerbach and Gutzkow are really poets, for his disgust at both will be so

great that he will be unable to read them any longer, and thus the problem

will be solved for him. Let no one imagine that it is an easy matter to develop

this feeling to the extent necessary in order to have this physical loathing; but

let no one hope to reach sound �sthetic judgments along any other road than

the thorny one of language, and by this I do not mean philological research,

but self-discipline in one's mother-tongue.

    "Everybody who is in earnest in this matter will have the same sort of

experience as the recruit in the army who is compelled to learn walking after

having walked almost all his life as a dilettante or empiricist. It is a hard time:

one almost fears that the tendons are going to snap and one ceases to hope

that the artificial and consciously acquired movements and positions of the

feet will ever be carried out with ease and comfort. It is painful to see how

awkwardly and heavily one foot is set before the other, and one dreads that

one may not only be unable to learn the new way of walking, but that one

will forget how to walk at all. Then it suddenly become noticeable that a new

habit and a second nature have been born of the practised movements, and

that the assurance and strength of the old manner of walking returns with a

little more grace: at this point one begins to realise how difficult walking is,

and one feels in a position to laugh at the untrained empiricist or the elegant

dilettante.  Our  'elegant'  writers,  as  their  style  shows,  have  never  learnt

'walking' in this sense, and in our public schools, as our other writers show,

no  one  learns  walking  either.  Culture  begins,  however,  with  the  correct

movement of the language: and once it has properly begun, it begets that

physical sensation in the presence of 'elegant' writers which is known by the

name of 'loathing.'

  "We recognise the fatal consequences of our present public schools, in

that they are unable to inculcate severe and genuine culture, which shouldconsist above all in obedience and habituation; and that, at their best, they

much  more  often  achieve  a  result  by  stimulating  and  kindling  scientific

tendencies,  is  shown  by  the  hand  which  is  so  frequently  seen  uniting

scholarship  and  barbarous  taste,  science  and  journalism.  In  a  very  large

majority of cases to-day we can observe how sadly our scholars fall short of

the standard of culture which the efforts of Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, and

Winckelmann established; and this falling short shows itself precisely in the

egregious errors which the men we speak of are exposed to, equally among

literary  historians--whether  Gervinus  or  Julian  Schmidt--as  in  any  other

company; everywhere, indeed, where men and women converse. It shows

itself most frequently and painfully, however, in pedagogic spheres, in the

literature of public schools. It can be proved that the only value that these

men have in a real educational establishment has not been mentioned, much

less generally recognised for half a century: their value as preparatory leaders

and mystogogues of classical culture, guided by whose hands alone can the

correct road leading to antiquity be found.

  "Every so-called classical education can have but one natural starting-

point--an artistic, earnest, and exact familiarity with the use of the mother-

tongue: this, together with the secret of form, however, one can seldom attain

to of one's own accord, almost everybody requires those great leaders and

tutors and must place himself in their hands. There is, however, no such thing

as a classical education that could grow without this inferred love of form.

Here, where the power of discerning form and barbarity gradually awakens,

there appear the pinions which bear one to the only real home of culture--

ancient Greece. If with the solitary help of those pinions we sought to reach

those  far-distant  and  diamond-studded  walls  encircling  the  stronghold  of

Hellenism, we should certainly not get very far; once more, therefore, we

need the same leaders and tutors, our German classical writers, that we may

be borne up, too, by the wing-strokes of their past endeavours--to the land of

yearning, to Greece.

  "Not a suspicion of this possible relationship between our classics and

classical education seems to have pierced the antique walls of public schools.

Philologists  seem  much  more  eagerly  engaged  in  introducing  Homer  and

Sophocles to the young souls of their pupils, in their own style, calling the

result simply by the unchallenged euphemism: 'classical education.' Let every

one's own experience tell him what he had of Homer and Sophocles at the

hands of such eager teachers. It is in this department that the greatest numberof deepest deceptions occur, and whence misunderstandings are inadvertently

spread. In German public schools I have never yet found a trace of what

might really be called 'classical education,' and there is nothing surprising in

this when one thinks of the way in which these institutions have emancipated

themselves from German classical writers and the discipline of the German

language. Nobody reaches antiquity by means of a leap into the dark, and yet

the  whole  method  of  treating  ancient  writers  in  schools,  the  plain

commentating  and  paraphrasing  of  our  philological  teachers,  amounts  to

nothing more than a leap into the dark.

  "The  feeling  for  classical  Hellenism  is,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  such  an

exceptional outcome of the most energetic fight for culture and artistic talent

that the public school could only have professed to awaken this feeling owing

to a very crude misunderstanding. In what age? In an age which is led about

blindly by the most sensational desires of the day, and which is not aware of

the  fact  that,  once  that  feeling  for  Hellenism  is  roused,  it  immediately

becomes aggressive and must express itself by indulging in an incessant war

with the so-called culture of the present. For the public school boy of to-day,

the  Hellenes  as  Hellenes  are  dead:  yes,  he  gets  some  enjoyment  out  of

Homer, but a novel by Spielhagen interests him much more: yes, he swallows

Greek tragedy and comedy with a certain relish, but a thoroughly modern

drama,  like  Freitag's  'Journalists,'  moves  him  in  quite  another  fashion.  In

regard to all ancient authors he is rather inclined to speak after the manner of

the �sthete, Hermann Grimm, who, on one occasion, at the end of a tortuous

essay on the Venus of Milo, asks himself: 'What does this goddess's form

mean to me? Of what use are the thoughts she suggests to me? Orestes and

�dipus, Iphigenia and Antigone, what have they in common with my heart?'-

-No, my dear public school boy, the Venus of Milo does not concern you in

any way, and concerns your teacher just as little--and that is the misfortune,

that is the secret of the modern public school. Who will conduct you to the

land of culture, if your leaders are blind and assume the position of seers

notwithstanding? Which of you will ever attain to a true feeling for the sacred

seriousness  of  art,  if  you  are  systematically  spoiled,  and  taught  to  stutter

independently instead of being taught to speak; to �stheticise on your own

account,  when  you  ought  to  be  taught  to  approach  works  of  art  almost

piously; to philosophise without assistance, while you ought to be compelled

to listen to great thinkers. All this with the result that you remain eternally at

a distance from antiquity and become the servants of the day.  "At all events, the most wholesome feature of our modern institutions is

to be found in the earnestness with which the Latin and Greek languages are

studied  over  a  long  course  of  years.  In  this  way  boys  learn  to  respect  a

grammar,  lexicons,  and  a  language  that  conforms  to  fixed  rules;  in  this

department  of  public  school  work  there  is  an  exact  knowledge  of  what

constitutes  a  fault,  and  no  one  is  troubled  with  any  thought  of  justifying

himself every minute by appealing (as in the case of modern German) to

various grammatical and orthographical vagaries and vicious forms. If only

this respect for language did not hang in the air so, like a theoretical burden

which one is pleased to throw off the moment one turns to one's mother-

tongue! More often than not, the classical master makes pretty short work of

the mother-tongue; from the outset he treats it as a department of knowledge

in which one is allowed that indolent ease with which the German treats

everything that belongs to his native soil. The splendid practice afforded by

translating from one language into another, which so improves and fertilises

one's artistic feeling for one's own tongue, is, in the case of German, never

conducted with that fitting categorical strictness and dignity which would be

above  all  necessary  in  dealing  with  an  undisciplined  language.  Of  late,

exercises of this kind have tended to decrease ever more and more: people are

satisfied to know the foreign classical tongues, they would scorn being able

to apply them.

  "Here  one  gets  another  glimpse  of  the  scholarly  tendency  of  public

schools: a phenomenon which throws much light upon the object which once

animated them,--that is to say, the serious desire to cultivate the pupil. This

belonged to the time of our great poets, those few really cultured Germans,--

the  time  when  the  magnificent  Friedrich  August  Wolf  directed  the  new

stream of classical thought, introduced from Greece and Rome by those men,

into the heart of the public schools. Thanks to his bold start, a new order of

public schools was established, which thenceforward was not to be merely a

nursery for science, but, above all, the actual consecrated home of all higher

and nobler culture.

  "Of the many necessary measures which this change called into being,

some of the most important have been transferred with lasting success to the

modern regulations of public schools: the most important of all, however, did

not succeed--the one demanding that the teacher, also, should be consecrated

to  the  new  spirit,  so  that  the  aim  of  the  public  school  has  meanwhile

considerably departed from the original plan laid down by Wolf, which wasthe cultivation of the pupil. The old estimate of scholarship and scholarly

culture,  as  an  absolute,  which  Wolf  overcame,  seems  after  a  slow  and

spiritless struggle rather to have taken the place of the culture-principle of

more recent introduction, and now claims its former exclusive rights, though

not with the same frankness, but disguised and with features veiled. And the

reason  why  it  was  impossible  to  make  public  schools  fall  in  with  the

magnificent plan of classical culture lay in the un-German, almost foreign or

cosmopolitan nature of these efforts in the cause of education: in the belief

that it was possible to remove the native soil from under a man's feet and that

he should still remain standing; in the illusion that people can spring direct,

without bridges, into the strange Hellenic world, by abjuring German and the

German mind in general.

  "Of course one must know how to trace this Germanic spirit to its lair

beneath its many modern dressings, or even beneath heaps of ruins; one must

love it so that one is not ashamed of it in its stunted form, and one must

above all be on one's guard against confounding it with what now disports

itself proudly as 'Up-to-date German culture.' The German spirit is very far

from being on friendly times with this up-to-date culture: and precisely in

those spheres where the latter complains of a lack of culture the real German

spirit has survived, though perhaps not always with a graceful, but more often

an ungraceful, exterior. On the other hand, that which now grandiloquently

assumes the title of 'German culture' is a sort of cosmopolitan aggregate,

which bears the same relation to the German spirit as Journalism does to

Schiller or Meyerbeer to Beethoven: here the strongest influence at work is

the fundamentally and thoroughly un-German civilisation of France, which is

aped neither with talent nor with taste, and the imitation of which gives the

society, the press, the art, and the literary style of Germany their pharisaical

character.  Naturally  the  copy  nowhere  produces  the  really  artistic  effect

which the original, grown out of the heart of Roman civilisation, is able to

produce almost to this day in France. Let any one who wishes to see the full

force of this contrast compare our most noted novelists with the less noted

ones  of  France  or  Italy:  he  will  recognise  in  both  the  same  doubtful

tendencies  and  aims,  as  also  the  same  still  more  doubtful  means,  but  in

France  he  will  find  them  coupled  with  artistic  earnestness,  at  least  with

grammatical purity, and often with beauty, while in their every feature he will

recognise the echo of a corresponding social culture. In Germany, on the

other hand, they will strike him as unoriginal, flabby, filled with dressing-gown  thoughts  and  expressions,  unpleasantly  spread  out,  and  therewithal

possessing  no  background  of  social  form.  At  the  most,  owing  to  their

scholarly mannerisms and display of knowledge, he will be reminded of the

fact  that  in  Latin  countries  it  is  the  artistically-trained  man,  and  that  in

Germany  it  is  the  abortive  scholar,  who  becomes  a  journalist.  With  this

would-be  German  and  thoroughly  unoriginal  culture,  the  German  can

nowhere reckon upon victory: the Frenchman and the Italian will always get

the better of him in this respect, while, in regard to the clever imitation of a

foreign culture, the Russian, above all, will always be his superior.

  "We are therefore all the more anxious to hold fast to that German spirit

which revealed itself in the German Reformation, and in German music, and

which has shown its enduring and genuine strength in the enormous courage

and severity of German philosophy and in the loyalty of the German soldier,

which has been tested quite recently. From it we expect a victory over that

'up-to-date' pseudo-culture which is now the fashion. What we should hope

for the future is that schools may draw the real school of culture into this

struggle, and kindle the flame of enthusiasm in the younger generation, more

particularly in public schools, for that which is truly German; and in this way

so-called classical education will resume its natural place and recover its one

possible starting-point.

  "A thorough reformation and purification of the public school can only be

the outcome of a profound and powerful reformation and purification of the

German spirit. It is a very complex and difficult task to find the border-line

which joins the heart of the Germanic spirit with the genius of Greece. Not,

however, before the noblest needs of genuine German genius snatch at the

hand of this genius of Greece as at a firm post in the torrent of barbarity, not

before a devouring yearning for this genius of Greece takes possession of

German  genius,  and  not  before  that  view  of  the  Greek  home,  on  which

Schiller and Goethe, after enormous exertions, were able to feast their eyes,

has  become  the  Mecca  of  the  best  and  most  gifted  men,  will  the  aim  of

classical education in public schools acquire any definition; and they at least

will not be to blame who teach ever so little science and learning in public

schools, in order to keep a definite and at the same time ideal aim in their

eyes,  and  to  rescue  their  pupils  from  that  glistening  phantom  which  now

allows itself to be called 'culture' and 'education.' This is the sad plight of the

public school of to-day: the narrowest views remain in a certain measure

right, because no one seems able to reach or, at least, to indicate the spotwhere all these views culminate in error."

  "No one?" the philosopher's pupil inquired with a slight quaver in his

voice; and both men were silent.

                                  THIRD LECTURE.

    (Delivered on the 27th of February 1872.)

  Ladies and Gentlemen,--At the close of my last lecture, the conversation

to which I was a listener, and the outlines of which, as I clearly recollect

them,  I  am  now  trying  to  lay  before  you,  was  interrupted  by  a  long  and

solemn pause. Both the philosopher and his companion sat silent, sunk in

deep  dejection:  the  peculiarly  critical  state  of  that  important  educational

institution,  the  German  public  school,  lay  upon  their  souls  like  a  heavy

burden, which one single, well-meaning individual is not strong enough to

remove, and the multitude, though strong, not well meaning enough.

  Our solitary thinkers were perturbed by two facts: by clearly perceiving

on the one hand that what might rightly be called "classical education" was

now only a far-off ideal, a castle in the air, which could not possibly be built

as a reality on the foundations of our present educational system, and that, on

the other hand, what was now, with customary and unopposed euphemism,

pointed to as "classical education" could only claim the value of a pretentious

illusion, the best effect of which was that the expression "classical education"

still lived on and had not yet lost its pathetic sound. These two worthy men

saw clearly, by the system of instruction in vogue, that the time was not yet

ripe for a higher culture, a culture founded upon that of the ancients: the

neglected state of linguistic instruction; the forcing of students into learned

historical paths, instead of giving them a practical training; the connection of

certain practices, encouraged in the public schools, with the objectionable

spirit of our journalistic publicity--all these easily perceptible phenomena of

the teaching of German led to the painful certainty that the most beneficial of

those forces which have come down to us from classical antiquity are not yet

known  in  our  public  schools:  forces  which  would  train  students  for  the

struggle against the barbarism of the present age, and which will perhapsonce more transform the public schools into the arsenals and workshops of

this struggle.

  On  the  other  hand,  it  would  seem  in  the  meantime  as  if  the  spirit  of

antiquity, in its fundamental principles, had already been driven away from

the portals of the public schools, and as if here also the gates were thrown

open  as  widely  as  possible  to  the  be-flattered  and  pampered  type  of  our

present  self-styled  "German  culture."  And  if  the  solitary  talkers  caught  a

glimpse of a single ray of hope, it was that things would have to become still

worse, that what was as yet divined only by the few would soon be clearly

perceived by the many, and that then the time for honest and resolute men for

the earnest consideration of the scope of the education of the masses would

not be far distant.

  After a few minutes' silent reflection, the philosopher's companion turned

to him and said: "You used to hold out hopes to me, but now you have done

more:  you  have  widened  my  intelligence,  and  with  it  my  strength  and

courage: now indeed can I look on the field of battle with more hardihood,

now  indeed  do  I  repent  of  my  too  hasty  flight.  We  want  nothing  for

ourselves, and it should be nothing to us how many individuals may fall in

this battle, or whether we ourselves may be among the first. Just because we

take this matter so seriously, we should not take our own poor selves so

seriously: at the very moment we are falling some one else will grasp the

banner of our faith. I will not even consider whether I am strong enough for

such a fight, whether I can offer sufficient resistance; it may even be an

honourable death to fall to the accompaniment of the mocking laughter of

such  enemies,  whose  seriousness  has  frequently  seemed  to  us  to  be

something  ridiculous.  When  I  think  how  my  contemporaries  prepared

themselves for the highest posts in the scholastic profession, as I myself have

done, then I know how we often laughed at the exact contrary, and grew

serious over something quite different----"

  "Now, my friend," interrupted the philosopher, laughingly, "you speak as

one who would fain dive into the water without being able to swim, and who

fears something even more than the mere drowning; not being drowned, but

laughed at. But being laughed at should be the very last thing for us to dread;

for we are in a sphere where there are too many truths to tell, too many

formidable, painful, unpardonable truths, for us to escape hatred, and only

fury here and there will give rise to some sort of embarrassed laughter. Just

think  of  the  innumerable  crowd  of  teachers,  who,  in  all  good  faith,  haveassimilated the system of education which has prevailed up to the present,

that they may cheerfully and without over-much deliberation carry it further

on. What do you think it will seem like to these men when they hear of

projects  from  which  they  are  excluded  beneficio  natur�;  of  commands

which their mediocre abilities are totally unable to carry out; of hopes which

find  no  echo  in  them;  of  battles  the  war-cries  of  which  they  do  not

understand, and in the fighting of which they can take part only as dull and

obtuse rank and file? But, without exaggeration, that must necessarily be the

position  of  practically  all  the  teachers  in  our  higher  educational

establishments: and indeed we cannot wonder at this when we consider how

such a teacher originates, how he becomes a teacher of such high status. Such

a large number of higher educational establishments are now to be found

everywhere that far more teachers will continue to be required for them than

the nature of even a highly-gifted people can produce; and thus an inordinate

stream of undesirables flows into these institutions, who, however, by their

preponderating numbers and their instinct of 'similis simile gaudet' gradually

come  to  determine  the  nature  of  these  institutions.  There  may  be  a  few

people, hopelessly unfamiliar with pedagogical matters, who believe that our

present profusion of public schools and teachers, which is manifestly out of

all  proportion,  can  be  changed  into  a  real  profusion,  an  ubertas  ingenii,

merely  by  a  few  rules  and  regulations,  and  without  any  reduction  in  the

number of these institutions. But we may surely be unanimous in recognising

that by the very nature of things only an exceedingly small number of people

are destined for a true course of education, and that a much smaller number

of  higher  educational  establishments  would  suffice  for  their  further

development, but that, in view of the present large numbers of educational

institutions, those for whom in general such institutions ought only to be

established must feel themselves to be the least facilitated in their progress.

  "The  same  holds  good  in  regard  to  teachers.  It  is  precisely  the  best

teachers--those  who,  generally  speaking,  judged  by  a  high  standard,  are

worthy of this honourable name--who are now perhaps the least fitted, in

view of the present standing of our public schools, for the education of these

unselected youths, huddled together in a confused heap; but who must rather,

quite at home in these institutions, as their moderate abilities stand in a kind

of  harmonious  relationship  to  the  dullness  of  their  pupils.  It  is  from  this
