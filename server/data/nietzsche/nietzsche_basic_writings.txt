Introduction 


PETER 
GAY 


Ever 
since 
Nietzsche 
went 
insane, 
and 
silent, 
in 
1889, 
as 
his 
fame 
was 
beginning 
to 
spread, 
his 
ideas 
have 
been 
most 
things 
to 
most 
men. 
Literally— 
for 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
women, 
interpretations 
of 
his 
views 
can 
hardly 
differ 
very 
much: 
he 
was 
an 
incurable 
misogynist. 
Nor 
could 
devout 
Christians 
derive 
any 
comfort 
from 
his 
writings, 
which 
are 
centrally 
preoccupied 
with 
a 
destructive 
analysis 
of 
Christianity, 
its 
birth, 
its 
triumph, 
its 
unfortunate 
longevity. 
As 
for 
principled 
democrats, 
they 
too 
cannot 
find 
much 
to 
please 
them 
in 
his 
work: 
whatever 
conclusion 
one 
may 
reach 
in 
the 
end 
about 
Nietzsche’s 
political 
thinking, 
it 
calls 
for 
the 
distinct 
separation 
of 
an 
elite 
and 
the 
masses. 


But 
existentialists 
and 
nihilists, 
chauvinists 
and 
cosmopolitans, 
anti-
Semites 
and 
philo-Semites, 
Francophiles 
and 
professional 
Teutons, 
Wagnerites 
and 
Brahmsians, 
nature 
worshipers 
and 
pragmatists, 
followers 
of 
Freud 
and 
his 
critics, 
have 
been 
struggling 
over 
his 
legacy 
for 
a 
century 
and 
more. 
They 
cannot 
all 
be 
right; 
in 
fact, 
most 
of 
them 
are 
wrong, 
dining 
off 
a 
few 
scraps 
that 
Nietzsche 
had 
thrown 
them 
in 
a 
careless 
mood. 
But 
this 
has 
not 
stopped 
them 
from 
arguing. 


Yet 
even 
in 
the 
less 
than 
angrily 
controversial 
domains, 
Nietzsche’s 
work 
has 
been 
at 
the 
mercy 
of 
ideologists 
of 
all 
stripes. 
What 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
evidence 
for 
women’s 
presumed 
inferiority? 
What 
is 
the 
reason 
for 
his 
anti-
Christian 
bent? 
What 
kind 
of 
elite 
is 
he 
calling 
for? 
Beyond 
that, 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
is 
he 
an 
absolute 
skeptic? 
Do 
his 
generalizations 
about 
nations 
support 
racism? 
Why 
does 
he 
do 
his 
utmost 
to 
distance 
himself 
from 
the 
Germany 
of 
his 
time? 
And 
what 
of 
Wagner, 
first 
his 
friend 
and 
then 
his 
enemy? 
The 
questions 
pile 
up 
and 
there 
are 
all 
too 
many 
answers 
canceling 
each 
other 
out. 


There 
is 
of 
course 
nothing 
new 
or 
unexpected 
concerning 
battles 
about 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
thinker’s 
work. 
One 
recalls 
Plato, 
Machiavelli, 
Hobbes, 



Rousseau, 
Hegel, 
and 
the 
debates 
that 
their 
“real” 
message 
has 
generated 
across 
the 
centuries. 
But 
Nietzsche’s 
thought 
has 
been 
particularly 
susceptible 
to 
often 
envenomed 
controversies, 
generating 
incompatible 
claims 
about 
the 
influence 
of 
that 
thought 
not 
only 
on 
recent 
philosophy, 
but 
also, 
and 
more 
portentously, 
on 
recent 
politics. 


Why? 
As 
readers 
of 
this 
volume 
can 
readily 
discover 
for 
themselves, 
Nietzsche 
was 
a 
superb 
stylist. 
Writing 
as 
trenchantly 
as 
he 
did, 
he 
was 
the 
antithesis 
of 
the 
traditional 
German 
professor, 
with 
his 
heavy 
vocabulary, 
serpentine 
sentences, 
and 
convoluted 
reasoning. 
But, 
paradoxical 
as 
it 
may 
sound, 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
too 
well 
for 
his 
own 
good. 
He 
coined 
memorable 
aphorisms 
and 
seductive 
locutions 
that 
have 
been 
used 
against 
him—by 
and 
large 
unfairly. 
Even 
if 
(indeed, 
especially 
if) 
we 
do 
not 
know 
much 
about 
Nietzsche, 
we 
are 
likely 
to 
remember 
his 
terms: 
“the 
blond 
beast,” 
which 
can 
easily 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
sample 
of 
Aryan 
megalomania, 
or 
the 
“Übermensch,” 
usually 
translated 
as 
“Superman,” 
thus 
awakening 
images 
of 
Clark 
Kent 
donning 
his 
cape. 
And 
what 
of 
his 
heartless, 
condescending 
observation, 
“Everything 
about 
woman 
has 
a 
solution: 
it 
is 
called 
pregnancy”? 
Though 
such 
Nietzschean 
views 
leave 
an 
unpleasant 
aftertaste, 
most 
can 
be 
satisfactorily 
clarified 
by 
the 
context 
and 
the 
dominant 
style 
of 
thinking 
that 
pervades 
his 
thought. 
But 
this 
means 
that 
one 
can 
judge 
Nietzsche 
only 
after 
reading 
him, 
not 
before. 


The 
fact 
is 
that 
many 
philosophers 
in 
many 
countries 
now 
read 
him, 
and 
with 
care; 
in 
all 
probability, 
Nietzsche 
is 
the 
most 
studied 
German 
thinker 
in 
English-, 
French-, 
and 
Italian-speaking 
cultures. 
His 
ability 
to 
turn 
accepted 
moral 
certitudes 
on 
their 
head, 
his 
skeptical 
questioning 
of 
confident 
realists 
who 
see 
the 
outside 
world 
as 
easily 
accessible 
to 
the 
investigator, 
and 
his 
astonishing 
psychological 
insights 
that 
have 
made 
it 
tempting 
to 
see 
Freud 
as 
his 
disciple 
(which 
he 
was 
not)—all 
this, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
makes 
him 
appealing 
to 
minds 
attached 
to 
the 
most 
varied 
systems. 
In 
some 
quarters, 
indeed, 
among 
some 
literary 
critics, 
he 
has 
become 
something 
of 
a 
fad. 
Postmodernists 
intent 
on 
showing 
that 
there 
is 
no 
stable 
world 
out 
there, 
and 
that 
everything 
is 
a 
“social 
construct,” 
have 
taken 
comfort 
from 
a 
remark 
of 
Nietzsche’s, 
“Truths 
are 
a 
useless 
fiction.” 
Well, 
of 
course 
one 
can 
easily 
find 
statements 
in 
Nietzsche 
that 
uphold 
the 
opposite, 
or 
generate 
doubts 
about 
this 
statement. 
A 
faithful 
(but 
not 
slavish) 
reader 
of 
Nietzsche 
must 
acknowledge 
that 
one 
reason 
why 
there 
is 
so 
much 
debate 
about 
Nietzsche’s 
meaning 
is 
that 
he 
occasionally 
contradicts 
himself. 
Hence 
the 
way 
to 
defend 



a 
certain 
position 
on 
Nietzsche 
is 
not 
to 
rely 
on 
a 
single 
aphorism, 
but 
to 
penetrate 
to 
the 
central 
significance 
of 
the 
texts 
in 
which 
the 
passage 
is 
embedded. 


There 
is 
another, 
a 
historical, 
reason 
why 
Nietzsche 
has 
aroused 
so 
much 
rancor 
across 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
especially 
after 
the 
outbreak 
of 
the 
First 
World 
War: 
his 
presumed 
advocacy 
of 
a 
brutal 
Teutonic 
philosophy 
of 
life 
that 
explained 
the 
alleged 
conduct 
of 
the 
German 
armies 
during 
the 
war. 


After 
January 
30, 
1933, 
this 
reproach 
grew 
even 
fiercer. 
On 
that 
day, 
Hitler 
was 
appointed 
chancellor 
of 
Germany, 
and 
with 
that, 
the 
charge 
that 
Nietzsche 
had 
inspired 
much 
of 
the 
Nazis’ 
murderous 
ideology 
became 
widespread 
and 
seemed 
utterly 
plausible. 
In 
Germany 
itself, 
after 
that 
fateful 
date, 
servile 
commentators, 
knowing 
what 
would 
please 
Joseph 
Goebbels, 
did 
their 
utmost 
to 
claim 
Nietzsche 
for 
Hitler’s 
“movement.” 
This 
was 
not 
so 
easily 
done; 
it 
necessitated 
explaining 
away 
the 
passages 
in 
Nietzsche 
that 
could 
not 
possibly 
be 
reconciled 
with 
Hitlerian 
dogma, 
but 
which 
were 
present, 
the 
authors 
had 
to 
admit, 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
works. 
One 
way 
of 
dealing 
with 
this 
dilemma 
was 
to 
falsify 
his 
texts, 
or 
to 
take 
some 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
comments 
out 
of 
context. 
Thus, 
his 
infrequent 
anti-Jewish 
remarks, 
normally 
surrounded 
by 
declarations 
of 
admiration 
for 
the 
Jews, 
could 
be 
stripped 
of 
this 
praise, 
so 
that 
they 
could 
misdescribe 
Nietzsche’s 
philo-Semitism 
as 
anti-
Semitism. 
The 
fact 
is 
that 
it 
was 
particularly 
the 
German 
anti-Semites 
of 
his 
own 
time 
that 
Nietzsche 
most 
despised. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
a 
not 
dissimilar 
view—Nietzsche 
the 
prophet 
of 
the 
Third 
Reich—though 
of 
course 
less 
infected 
with 
propaganda, 
carried 
the 
day. 
The 
one 
or 
two 
more 
responsible 
interpreters 
who 
knew 
their 
Nietzsche 
better 
than 
this 
were 
swamped 
in 
the 
hostile 
consensus. 


One 
influential 
interpretation, 
which 
declared 
Nietzsche 
to 
be 
half 
a 
Nazi, 
was 
Crane 
Brinton’s 
Nietzsche, 
published 
in 
1941. 
A 
highly 
respected 
historian 
at 
Harvard 
University, 
Brinton 
was 
an 
accessible 
essayist 
whose 
weighty 
opinions 
seemed 
to 
confirm 
what 
more 
casual 
writers 
and 
readers 
had 
long 
held 
against 
Nietzsche. 
Then, 
nine 
years 
after, 
a 
philosopher 
at 
Princeton 
University, 
Walter 
A. 
Kaufmann, 
published 
Nietzsche: 
Philosopher, 
Psychologist, 
Antichrist, 
and 
Nietzsche 
scholarship 
was 
never 
the 
same 
again. 


Polemics 
about 
philosophers 
rarely 
reach 
a 
wider 
audience, 
but 
the 
academic 
world 
and 
to 
some 
extent 
even 
the 
interested 
general 
public 
read 
Kaufmann’s 
intellectual 
biography 
with 
admiration 
and 
shame—admiration 



for 
the 
author’s 
powerful 
defense 
of 
Nietzsche 
and 
his 
effective 
work 
of 
demolishing 
legends 
about 
him; 
shame 
for 
their 
own 
hasty 
and 
ill-informed 
verdicts 
on 
a 
thinker 
who 
apparently 
deserved 
their 
close 
and 
sympathetic 
attention 
far 
more 
than 
they 
had 
believed 
possible. 
It 
is 
safe 
to 
say 
that 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
no 
American 
academic 
study 
has 
had 
a 
wider, 
and 
more 
fully 
deserved, 
impact 
than 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche. 


Kaufmann 
was 
nothing 
if 
not 
thorough. 
He 
exposed 
in 
detail 
the 
machinations 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
sister 
Elisabeth 
to 
manipulate 
her 
brother’s 
texts, 
and 
to 
enlist 
him 
in 
the 
very 
causes 
that 
he 
had 
consistently 
denounced. 
Her 
crude 
prejudices, 
including 
a 
heavy 
dose 
of 
anti-Semitism, 
had 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
her 
brother’s 
philosophy. 
Since 
she 
controlled 
his 
papers, 
she 
could 
publish 
from 
his 
vast 
pile 
of 
notes 
what 
she 
chose, 
and 
carpenter 
together 
materials 
that 
did 
not 
belong 
together 
or 
that 
he 
had 
discarded. 
For 
eleven 
years, 
until 
Nietzsche’s 
death 
in 
1900, 
and 
for 
years 
thereafter, 
she 
held 
a 
virtual 
monopoly 
on 
interpreting 
her 
brother 
to 
the 
world, 
and 
other 
commentators 
on 
Nietzsche’s 
thought 
more 
or 
less 
helplessly 
followed 
her 
deceptive 
lead. 
What 
Kaufmann 
calls 
“the 
Nietzsche 
legend” 
owes 
more 
to 
her 
than 
to 
any 
other 
commentator. 


Her 
work 
as 
her 
brother’s 
editor, 
then, 
made 
the 
“real” 
Nietzsche 
virtually 
disappear 
from 
view. 
Readers 
in 
the 
English-speaking 
world 
who 
had 
no 
German 
faced 
an 
additional 
obstacle: 
the 
translations. 
In 
Nietzsche, 
Kaufmann 
spends 
no 
time 
giving 
the 
gruesome 
details, 
but 
he 
left 
no 
doubt 
that 
all 
the 
translations 
in 
the 
book 
were 
his 
in 
part 
because, 
he 
writes 
in 
the 
preface, 
“[t]he 
purpose 
of 
the 
quotations 
was 
often 
to 
establish 
new 
interpretations 
…” 
(p. 
ix). 
And 
he 
faced 
the 
consequences 
of 
his 
critical 
view 
toward 
existing 
translations: 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
English-speaking 
readers 
to 
confront 
Nietzsche 
as 
authentically 
as 
any 
translation 
can 
make 
it, 
Kaufmann, 
after 
publishing 
Nietzsche 
(a 
book 
that 
went 
into 
several 
editions), 
set 
about 
rendering 
Nietzsche’s 
main 
writings 
into 
English. 
The 
reader 
of 
Basic 
Writings 
of 
Nietzsche 
is 
the 
beneficiary 
of 
Kaufmann’s 
diligence: 
he 
has 
translated 
every 
text 
in 
this 
volume. 


Friedrich 
Nietzsche’s 
life 
was 
a 
dramatic 
one, 
but 
all 
his 
drama 
was 
interior. 
He 
was 
born 
in 
1844, 
the 
son 
of 
a 
Lutheran 
pastor 
and 
a 
devout 
hausfrau, 
and 
proved 
a 
prodigy. 
After 
studying 
at 
the 
universities 
of 
Bonn 
and 
Leipzig, 
in 
1869 
he 
was 
appointed, 
at 
the 
ripe 
age 
of 
twenty-four, 
to 
the 



chair 
of 
classical 
philology 
at 
Basel. 
Among 
his 
acquaintances 
was 
the 
great 
scholar 
Jakob 
Burckhardt, 
the 
historian 
who 
put 
the 
Italian 
Renaissance 
on 
the 
map. 
It 
was 
there 
that 
he 
wrote 
his 
first 
book, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
(1872), 
an 
original, 
highly 
suggestive 
analysis 
of 
tragedy 
and 
of 
ancient 
Greek 
culture 
as 
a 
tense 
struggle 
between 
liberated 
Dionysian 
impulses 
(whose 
prestige 
Nietzsche 
was 
intent 
on 
restoring) 
and 
controlled 
Apollonian 
reason. 
In 
its 
later 
chapters, 
the 
book 
threw 
a 
bridge 
between 
antiquity 
and 
his 
own 
times 
by 
extravagantly 
praising 
Richard 
Wagner, 
whose 
friend 
he 
had 
become. 
His 
next 
widely 
read 
work, 
Untimely 
Meditations 
(1873–76), 
a 
collection 
of 
four 
lengthy 
essays 
dealing 
with 
such 
subjects 
as 
Schopenhauer, 
Wagner, 
and 
the 
writing 
of 
history, 
displayed 
Nietzsche’s 
interest 
in 
current 
affairs 
and 
his 
delight 
in 
polemics. 
The 
“Untimely” 
in 
the 
title 
of 
this 
collection 
must 
be 
read 
to 
mean 
only 
that 
its 
author 
stood 
ready 
to 
confront 
his 
times 
with 
some 
unconventional 
views. 


Plainly, 
the 
philologist 
and 
lover 
of 
music 
was 
turning 
into 
a 
cultural 
commentator, 
an 
unrelenting 
critic 
of 
the 
modern 
bourgeoisie, 
of 
religion 
and 
moral 
philosophy 
as 
then 
practiced, 
and 
of 
the 
German 
Empire, 
founded 
in 
1871, 
the 
unremitting 
target 
of 
his 
sarcasm 
and 
contempt. 
He 
took 
pride 
in 
calling 
himself 
a 
good 
European. 
His 
admiration 
for 
Wagner, 
that 
all-too-
German 
composer 
and 
virulent 
anti-Semite, 
waned 
until 
his 
animosity 
became 
marked, 
principled, 
and 
public. 
Readers 
of 
this 
volume 
can 
get 
a 
good 
account 
of 
the 
grounds 
for 
this 
hostility 
in 
“The 
Case 
of 
Wagner” 
and 
in 
Walter 
Kaufmann’s 
introduction 
(which, 
like 
all 
his 
other 
introductions 
in 
this 
volume, 
is 
outspoken 
and 
authoritative). 


In 
1879, 
intermittently 
troubled 
by 
ill 
health 
including 
almost 
intolerable 
headaches, 
Nietzsche 
resigned 
his 
professorship 
and 
sought 
relief 
in 
the 
Swiss 
mountains 
(the 
little 
village 
of 
Sils 
Maria) 
and 
Italian 
cities 
like 
Turin 
—in 
vain. 
It 
was 
by 
and 
large 
a 
lonely 
life, 
his 
solitude 
broken 
only 
by 
occasional 
visits 
by 
a 
few—a 
very 
few—loyal 
disciples. 
But 
for 
a 
decade, 
he 
produced 
his 
most 
enduring 
books 
in 
this 
hermitlike 
existence. 
Two 
among 
these 
crucial 
texts 
appear 
in 
this 
volume, 
in 
full: 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
(1886) 
and 
The 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals 
(1887), 
and 
repay 
the 
closest 
attention. 


For 
the 
most 
part 
his 
writings 
are 
cast 
in 
chains 
of 
brilliant 
aphorisms 
or 
connected 
essays. 
He 
pursued 
his 
quarrel 
with 
Christianity 
and 
conventional 
morality, 
his 
analysis 
of 
the 
aristocrats 
of 
life 
and 
the 
crowd 
man, 
his 
thoughts 
on 
human 
knowledge 
and 
human 
destiny. 
He 
did 
not 
complete 
a 
philosophical 
system; 
he 
had 
intended 
to 
write 
a 
synthesis 
of 
his 
thinking 
and 



diligently 
took 
notes 
for 
what 
he 
wanted 
to 
call 
“The 
Will 
to 
Power.” 
But 
he 
never 
did, 
and 
what 
his 
sister 
brought 
out 
after 
his 
death 
under 
this 
title 
had 
neither 
the 
form, 
nor 
the 
intellectual 
argument, 
he 
had 
wanted 
to 
give 
it. 
Still, 
the 
enterprise 
he 
managed 
to 
stamp 
with 
his 
unique 
way 
of 
thinking 
was 
one 
of 
stupendous 
daring 
and 
unending 
interest 
even 
for 
the 
reader 
who 
in 
the 
end 
disagrees 
with 
Nietzsche. 
In 
1888, 
the 
great 
Danish 
critic 
Georg 
Brandes 
gave 
Nietzsche 
his 
first 
general 
recognition 
in 
a 
series 
of 
lectures. 
And 
then, 
in 
January 
1889, 
Nietzsche 
went 
mad 
and 
could 
no 
longer 
defend 
himself 
against 
the 
distortions 
by 
his 
sister 
and 
like-minded 
ideologues. 


Yet 
now, 
thanks 
in 
considerable 
part 
to 
the 
expositions 
and 
the 
translations 
by 
Walter 
Kaufmann, 
of 
which 
generous 
samples 
appear 
in 
this 
volume, 
and 
to 
the 
work 
he 
inspired 
over 
the 
years, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
see 
Nietzsche 
plain. 
As 
he 
put 
it 
a 
little 
pathetically 
in 
the 
intellectual 
autobiography 
he 
wrote 
shortly 
before 
his 
breakdown, 
Ecce 
Homo, 
a 
book 
eminently 
worth 
reading: 
“Hear 
me! 
For 
I 
am 
such 
and 
such 
a 
person. 
Above 
all, 
do 
not 
mistake 
me 
for 
someone 
else.”

A 
Note 
on 
This 
Edition 


This 
volume 
contains 
five 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
major 
works, 
complete, 
as 
well 
as 
seventy-five 
aphorisms 
from 
his 
five 
aphoristic 
books, 
selections 
from 
his 
correspondence 
about 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner, 
and 
variants 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
drafts 
for 
Ecce 
Homo. 
I 
have 
also 
furnished 
footnote 
commentaries 
on 
all 
of 
this 
material, 
and 
have 
contributed 
introductions 
and 
indices. 


All 
footnotes 
are 
mine, 
except 
three 
in 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner, 
which 
are 
clearly 
identified: 
these 
are 
the 
only 
footnotes 
Nietzsche 
himself 
included 
in 
any 
of 
his 
books. 


The 
translations 
were 
made 
especially 
for 
this 
volume. 
I 
have 
used 
Clifton 
Fadiman’s 
early 
translation 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
done 
when 
he 
was 
a 
graduate 
student, 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
some 
parts 
of 
my 
new 
version. 
But 
even 
where 
I 
did 
not 
start 
from 
scratch, 
I 
have 
compared 
every 
sentence 
with 
the 
original, 
and 
my 
revisions 
are 
so 
extensive 
that 
the 
new 
version 
is 
probably 
more 
different 
from 
his 
than 
most 
Nietzsche 
translations—including 
Fadiman’s—are 
from 
those 
that 
preceded 
them. 
And 
in 
large 
part 
I 
did 
work 
from 
scratch. 
I 
have 
made 
extensive 
use 
of 
a 
draft 
translation 
of 
On 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals, 
furnished 
me 
by 
R. 
J. 
Hollingdale; 
but 
I 
alone 
bear 
the 
responsibility 
for 
the 
final 
version. 
The 
other 
translations, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
commentaries, 
involved 
no 
collaboration. 


In 
the 
original 
German, 
almost 
every 
numbered 
section 
constitutes 
a 
single 
paragraph. 
Nietzsche 
used 
dashes 
and 
three 
dots 
to 
indicate 
breaks. 
I 
have 
largely 
dispensed 
with 
these 
devices 
and 
begun 
new 
paragraphs 
wherever 
that 
seemed 
helpful. 


W.K. 



Introduction 
by 
the 
Editor 


Nietzsche 
is 
one 
of 
the 
few 
philosophers 
since 
Plato 
whom 
large 
numbers 
of 
intelligent 
people 
read 
for 
pleasure. 
Philosophers 
of 
that 
sort 
are 
mostly 
French 
and 
rarely 
taken 
very 
seriously 
by 
twentieth-century 
philosophy 
professors. 
The 
only 
French 
philosopher 
whom 
professional 
philosophers 
generally 
accord 
highest 
honors 
is 
Descartes. 
Montaigne 
and 
Pascal, 
Voltaire 
and 
Rousseau, 
Bergson 
and 
Sartre 
do 
not 
enjoy 
their 
greatest 
vogue 
among 
philosophers, 
and 
of 
these 
only 
Rousseau 
has 
had 
any 
considerable 
influence 
on 
the 
history 
of 
philosophy 
(through 
Kant 
and 
Hegel). 
One 
may 
actually 
be 
led 
to 
wonder 
whether 
in 
philosophy 
there 
is 
an 
inverse 
proportion 
between 
profundity 
and 
importance 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
clarity 
and 
excellence 
of 
style 
on 
the 
other. 
If 
Plato 
seems 
to 
prove 
that 
this 
need 
not 
be 
so, 
many 
twentieth-century 
philosophers 
would 
be 
quick 
to 
counter 
that, 
philosophically, 
Plato’s 
early 
and 
more 
literary 
dialogues 
are 
less 
important 
than 
his 
later 
dialogues, 
especially 
where 
they 
stump 
even 
professionals. 
And 
in 
Kant’s 
case 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
his 
worst-written 
book, 
the 
Critique 
of 
Pure 
Reason, 
is 
his 
greatest 
work. 


Where 
does 
this 
leave 
Nietzsche? 
At 
first 
glance 
it 
would 
seem 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Montaigne, 
Pascal, 
and 
Voltaire. 
But 
there 
is 
much 
more 
philosophy 
in 
his 
writings 
than 
in 
theirs, 
and 
his 
influence—also 
on 
philosophy 
professors—far 
exceeds 
theirs. 
A 
surprising 
number 
of 
German 
professors 
of 
philosophy 
have 
written 
books 
on 
him 
ever 
since 
he 
died 
in 
1900, 
and 
hardly 
any 
German 
philosopher 
of 
note 
since 
that 
time 
has 
escaped 
the 
impact 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
thought. 
To 
single 
out 
at 
least 
a 
few 
of 
them: 
Hans 
Vaihinger 
and 
Georg 
Simmel, 
Nicolai 
Hartmann 
and 
Karl 
Jaspers. 
Indeed, 
the 
only 
outstanding 
exception 
was 
Edmund 
Husserl; 
and 
his 
most 
renowned 
followers—Max 
Scheler 
and 
Martin 
Heidegger—changed 
their 
orientation 
drastically 
after 
coming 
under 
Nietzsche’s 
influence. 
This 
is 
also 
true 
of 
Jean-
Paul 
Sartre. 
Indeed, 
one 
of 
Sartre’s 
best-known 
literary 
works 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
embody 
Nietzsche’s 
ideas: 
the 
ethic 
of 
The 
Flies 
differs 
sharply 
from 



Sartre’s 
own 
Being 
and 
Nothingness, 
finished 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
from 
his 
famous 
lecture, 
Existentialism 
Is 
a 
Humanism, 
but 
contains 
dozens 
of 
echoes 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
writings, 
and 
the 
central 
motifs 
of 
the 
play 
are 
Nietzschean.1 


Perhaps 
Nietzsche’s 
influence 
on 
literature 
is 
even 
more 
striking 
than 
his 
impact 
on 
twentieth-century 
philosophy. 
Besides 
Sartre, 
one 
may 
think 
of 
Camus, 
Gide, 
and 
Malraux; 
of 
Thomas 
Mann 
and 
Hermann 
Hesse; 
and 
among 
German 
poets, 
of 
Rilke 
and 
Stefan 
George, 
Christian 
Morgenstern 
and 
Gottfried 
Benn.2 
His 
influence 
on 
Shaw, 
Yeats, 
and 
Joyce, 
and 
on 
Eugene 
O’Neill 
and 
other 
major 
American 
writers 
deserves 
more 
study 
than 
it 
has 
yet 
received. 


Nietzsche’s 
anticipations 
of 
and 
influence 
on 
various 
psychological 
theories 
are 
no 
less 
remarkable. 
In 
section 
142 
of 
The 
Dawn 
he 
anticipated 
the 
so-called 
James-Lange 
theory 
of 
the 
emotions; 
again 
and 
again 
he 
pioneered 
what 
Jaspers 
later 
called, 
in 
the 
title 
of 
his 
first 
major 
philosophical 
work, 
Psychologie 
der 
Weltanschauungen 
(psychology 
of 
world 
views); 
and 
Sigmund 
Freud 
remarked 
in 
an 
autobiographical 
sketch 
that 
Nietzsche’s 
“premonitions 
and 
insights 
often 
agree 
in 
the 
most 
amazing 
manner 
with 
the 
laborious 
results 
of 
psychoanalysis.”3 
Alfred 
Adler’s 
modification 
of 
Freud’s 
theories, 
which 
in 
turn 
profoundly 
influenced 
Sartre,4 
is 
even 
closer 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
psychology 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power 
than 
Freudianism. 


Freud 
also 
“several 
times 
said 
of 
Nietzsche 
that 
he 
had 
a 
more 
penetrating 
knowledge 
of 
himself 
than 
any 
other 
man 
who 
ever 
lived 
or 
was 
ever 
likely 
to 
live.”5 
This 
is 
surely 
an 
extraordinary 
compliment 
from 
the 
founder 
of 
psychoanalysis 
whose 
life’s 
work 
it 
had 
been 
to 
develop 
techniques 
to 
advance 
man’s 
knowledge 
of 
himself. 
It 
may 
well 
have 
been 
too 
generous. 
But 
it 
contrasts 
pleasantly 
with 
the 
occasional 
condescension 
of 
would-be 
psychologists 
who 
claim 
to 
have 
figured 
out 
the 
inner 
workings 
of 
“poor” 
Nietzsche’s 
mind. 
And 
Freud 
was 
certainly 
right 
in 
suggesting 
that 
Nietzsche 
is 
of 
extraordinary 
interest 
not 
only 
as 
a 
philosopher 
and 
writer 
but 
also 
as 
a 
psychologist 
and 
a 
human 
being. 


His 
influence 
extends 
much 
further 
than 
suggested 
so 
far. 
In 
the 
preface 
to 
The 
Decline 
of 
the 
West, 
Spengler 
said 
that 
he 
owed 
“everything” 
to 
Goethe 
and 
Nietzsche. 
Paul 
Tillich 
has 
frequently 
paid 
tribute 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
influence 
on 
his 
own 
thought, 
actually 
hailing 
Marx, 
Nietzsche, 
and 
Freud 
as 
the 
greatest 
modern 
“Protestants.” 
Martin 
Buber 
was 
eighty-five 
when 
he 
revealed 
in 
print 
that 
at 
age 
seventeen—that 
is, 
in 
1895—he 
was 
“so 
taken 
by” 
Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra 
“that 
I 
decided 
to 
translate 
it 
into 
Polish 
and 
had 



even 
translated 
the 
first 
part. 
I 
had 
just 
gone 
to 
the 
second 
part 
when 
I 
received 
the 
letter 
of 
a 
known 
Polish 
author 
who 
likewise 
had 
translated 
several 
sections 
of 
the 
book 
and 
proposed 
to 
me 
that 
we 
do 
the 
work 
in 
common. 
I 
preferred 
renouncing 
in 
his 
favor.”6 


The 
full 
story 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
influence 
has 
never 
been 
told 
and 
cannot 
be 
told 
yet. 
Buber’s 
remark 
was 
not 
published 
until 
1963; 
a 
letter 
in 
which 
Freud 
said 
of 
Nietzsche, 
“In 
my 
youth 
he 
signified 
a 
nobility 
which 
I 
could 
not 
attain,” 
was 
published 
posthumously.7 
No 
doubt, 
many 
relevant 
documents 
will 
appear 
in 
years 
to 
come. 
What 
is 
called 
for 
in 
this 
introduction 
is 
merely 
an 
attempt 
to 
forestall 
snap 
judgments 
about 
Nietzsche. 


Shallow 
judgments 
frequently 
take 
one 
of 
three 
forms. 
Either 
one 
knows 
all 
about 
Nietzsche: 
he 
was 
the 
man 
who 
said, 
or 
claimed, 
or 
believed 
this 
or 
that. 
Or 
one 
knows 
how 
to 
label 
Nietzsche 
as, 
say, 
an 
irrationalist 
metaphysician, 
or 
an 
evolutionist 
in 
ethics, 
or 
an 
existentialist. 
Worst 
of 
all, 
people 
who 
have 
never 
read 
a 
single 
one 
of 
his 
books 
from 
beginning 
to 
end 
“knew” 
at 
one 
time 
that 
he 
was 
the 
mind 
that 
had 
caused 
World 
War 
I, 
and 
a 
generation 
later 
that 
he 
was 
a 
Nazi 
philosopher. 
Regarding 
this 
last 
notion, 
suffice 
it 
here 
to 
say 
that 
all 
serious 
interpreters 
of 
Nietzsche, 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
they 
may 
disagree 
on 
other 
points, 
agree 
that 
this 
absurdity 
can 
be 
supported 
only 
by 
either 
rank 
ignorance 
of 
his 
works 
(common 
at 
one 
time 
in 
the 
English-speaking 
world) 
or 
an 
incredible 
lack 
of 
intellectual 
integrity 
(common 
to 
a 
few 
Nazi 
hacks). 
In 
fact, 
no 
other 
philosopher 
since 
Plato 
and 
Aristotle, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Kant 
and 
Hegel, 
has 
influenced 
so 
many 
widely 
different 
thinkers 
and 
writers 
so 
profoundly. 


There 
are 
no 
signs 
that 
interest 
in 
Nietzsche 
is 
flagging. 
He 
is 
more 
widely 
read 
and 
studied 
than 
ever; 
only 
the 
perspectives 
keep 
changing. 
Once 
it 
was 
the 
fashion 
to 
link 
him 
with 
Darwin 
and 
evolutionary 
thought, 
but 
his 
reputation 
did 
not 
pass 
with 
this 
fashion, 
and 
it 
actually 
gained 
when 
more 
and 
more 
writers 
came 
to 
realize 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
such 
an 
interpretation. 
The 
same 
goes 
for 
later 
vogues. 
What 
gradually 
becomes 
more 
and 
more 
obvious 
is 
the 
unexampled 
richness 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
thought. 


Nietzsche 
was 
not 
a 
one-book 
man. 
Nor 
are 
there 
two 
or 
three 
books 
that 
are 
obviously 
his 
best 
and 
most 
important. 
Born 
in 
1844, 
Nietzsche 
published 
his 
first 
book, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
in 
1872.8 
He 
followed 
it 
with 
four 
shorter 
essays 
which 
he 
called 
“Untimely 
Meditations”; 
in 
the 
English 
translation 
they 
were 
called 
Thoughts 
Out 
of 
Season—as 
if 
they 
were 
collections 
of 
aphorisms, 
which 
they 
are 
not, 
not 
even 
in 
appearance. 



Nietzsche 
here 
became 
a 
critic 
of 
his 
time—the 
period 
after 
the 
Franco-
Prussian 
War 
of 
1870–71, 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
new 
German 
Empire, 
the 
age 
of 
Bismarck. 
Instead 
of 
joining 
in 
the 
growing 
self-satisfaction 
of 
his 
people, 
Nietzsche 
developed 
into 
their 
severest 
critic. 


Then 
came 
the 
break 
with 
Richard 
Wagner, 
the 
resignation 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Basel, 
where 
he 
had 
been 
a 
professor 
of 
classical 
philology 
from 
1869 
to 
1879, 
and 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
three 
volumes 
of 
Human, 
All-
Too-Human, 
followed 
by 
The 
Dawn 
and 
The 
Gay 
Science.9 
In 
these 
books 
Nietzsche 
turned 
against 
the 
romanticism 
of 
his 
first 
period, 
consciously 
imitated 
the 
French 
aphorists 
of 
the 
Enlightenment, 
and 
became, 
in 
his 
own 
phrase, 
a 
Good 
European. 


Had 
Nietzsche 
died 
then, 
at 
thirty-seven, 
he 
would 
be 
remembered 
as 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
masters 
of 
German 
prose 
and 
a 
thinker 
comparable 
to 
Montaigne 
and 
Pascal. 
He 
would 
still 
be 
cited 
as 
proof 
that 
the 
German 
language 
can 
be 
used 
to 
write 
lucidly, 
penetratingly, 
wittily, 
and 
beautifully 
about 
topics 
on 
which 
German 
professors, 
from 
Kant 
down 
to 
Heidegger, 
have 
written 
without 
a 
trace 
of 
wit 
or 
beauty. 
But 
he 
would 
not 
be 
a 
world-
historical 
figure; 
his 
influence 
would 
be 
nothing 
like 
what 
it 
has 
been—it 
would 
be 
as 
if 
Shakespeare 
had 
died 
at 
thirty-seven, 
in 
1601. 
The 
author 
of 
Romeo 
and 
Juliet, 
Richard 
II 
and 
III, 
The 
Merchant 
of 
Venice, 
Midsummer 
Night’s 
Dream, 
and 
Henry 
IV 
would 
be 
certain 
of 
a 
place 
of 
honor, 
but 
without 
his 
ten 
greatest 
works, 
all 
written 
during 
the 
next 
ten 
years, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
been 
what 
Shakespeare 
has 
been 
to 
millions 
since. 


Nietzsche 
came 
into 
his 
own 
during 
the 
last 
six 
years 
of 
his 
creative 
life. 
Between 
the 
winter 
of 
1882–83 
and 
the 
end 
of 
1888 
he 
completed 
eight 
books. 
None 
of 
these 
are 
merely 
collections 
of 
aphorisms 
that 
can 
easily 
be 
represented 
by 
excerpts; 
all 
eight 
should 
be 
read 
in 
their 
entirety, 
with 
a 
regard 
for 
context 
and 
nuances. 
Four 
of 
these 
books 
were 
made 
available 
in 
a 
single 
volume, 
in 
entirely 
new 
translations, 
in 
1954;10 
the 
other 
four 
are 
offered 
in 
the 
present 
volume, 
together 
with 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
and 
some 
supplementary 
material. 
Thus 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
books 
are 
now 
available 
in 
two 
volumes, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
four 
meditations 
(of 
interest 
mainly 
as 
early 
works 
of 
the 
man 
who 
wrote 
the 
works 
included 
in 
these 
two 
volumes) 
and 
the 
aphoristic 
books 
(represented 
by 
sample 
in 
both 
volumes). 
Overlap 
has 
been 
avoided 
deliberately 
in 
order 
to 
make 
readily 
accessible 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
work. 


The 
arrangement 
of 
the 
material 
in 
this 
volume 
is 
chronological, 
except 
for 



the 
Preface 
to 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
which 
was 
added 
by 
Nietzsche 
to 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
1886 
and 
is 
representative 
of 
his 
later 
style. 
All 
of 
the 
translations 
were 
made 
especially 
for 
the 
present 
volume 
and 
published 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
1966–67. 
The 
editor 
has 
contributed 
a 
separate 
introduction 
for 
each 
of 
the 
five 
books 
included, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
detailed 
footnote 
commentary; 
and 
there 
are 
indices. 


In 
sum, 
this 
edition 
is 
designed 
for 
serious 
study 
as 
well 
as 
enjoyment. 
Any 
dichotomy 
of 
these 
two 
would 
have 
been 
anathema 
to 
Nietzsche; 
and 
once 
the 
dichotomy 
is 
rejected, 
both 
“enjoyment” 
and 
“serious 
study” 
become 
infelicitous 
expressions. 
Nietzsche 
clearly 
wanted 
to 
be 
read 
with 
a 
delighted 
awareness 
of 
nuances 
of 
style 
and 
thought. 
He 
wanted 
readers 
whose 
sense 
of 
his 
exceptional 
versatility 
does 
not 
keep 
them 
from 
feeling 
that 
their 
own 
convictions 
and 
values 
are 
at 
stake 
and 
must 
be 
reconsidered 
in 
the 
light 
of 
what 
he 
says. 
There 
is 
no 
work 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
that 
does 
not 
say 
to 
us, 
like 
Rilke’s 
“Archaic 
Torso 
of 
Apollo”: 


“You 
must 
change 
your 
life.”

But 
for 
Jason 
Epstein 
I 
should 
never 
have 
translated 
another 
Nietzsche 
book 
after 
1954. 
He 
persevered; 
he 
left 
the 
choice 
of 
books 
and 
all 
particulars 
entirely 
up 
to 
me; 
and 
eventually 
I 
consented 
to 
go 
over 
some 
of 
the 
old 
versions 
to 
eliminate 
outright 
errors. 
This 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
thankless, 
endless, 
and 
all 
but 
impossible 
undertaking. 
Hence 
I 
gave 
up 
and 
made 
some 
more 
new 
translations. 
The 
commentaries, 
not 
anticipated, 
took 
form 
as 
the 
translations 
progressed. 


Berenice 
Hoffman’s 
editorial 
queries 
and 
suggestions 
have 
been 
unfailingly 
expert 
and 
gracious, 
and 
she 
deserves 
the 
readers’ 
thanks 
as 
well 
as 
mine 
for 
her 
unstinting 
devotion 
to 
an 
often 
extremely 
difficult 
task. 


Stephen 
Watson 
helped 
me 
with 
the 
indices, 
and 
Sonia 
Volochova 
made 
valuable 
additions 
to 
them. 
Mr. 
Watson, 
as 
a 
University 
Scholar 
at 
Princeton 
University, 
also 
called 
to 
my 
attention 
many 
points 
on 
which 
he 
thought 
students 
needed 
help, 
especially 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
and 
aided 
me 
by 
reading 
proofs. 


George 
Brakas 
read 
the

proofs 
of

and 
called 
to 
my

many 
points 
that 
were 
not

clear 
as, 
I 
hope, 
they 
are 
now.

Translator’s 
Introduction 


This 
was 
Nietzsche’s 
first 
book. 
It 
is 
far 
from 
being 
his 
best 
book, 
but 
the 
“Attempt 
at 
a 
Self-Criticism” 
that 
Nietzsche 
placed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
“new 
edition” 
of 
1886 
is 
among 
the 
finest 
things 
he 
ever 
wrote. 
Perhaps 
no 
other 
great 
writer 
has 
written 
a 
comparable 
preface 
to 
one 
of 
his 
own 
works. 
Certainly 
this 
self-criticism 
is 
far 
superior 
to 
most 
of 
the 
criticisms 
others 
have 
directed 
against 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy. 


Before 
considering 
briefly 
the 
most 
famous 
critique 
of 
the 
book, 
it 
may 
be 
well 
to 
suggest 
something 
of 
its 
importance. 
Apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
essay 
has 
been 
widely 
admired 
and 
is 
generally 
taken 
for 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
major 
works, 
its 
significance 
may 
be 
said 
to 
be 
threefold. 


First 
of 
all, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
is, 
for 
all 
its 
faults, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
suggestive 
and 
influential 
studies 
of 
tragedy 
ever 
written. 
Perhaps 
only 
Aristotle’s 
Poetics 
excels 
it. 
What 
other 
study 
of 
tragedy 
could 
one 
place 
beside 
it? 
Only 
Hegel’s 
scattered 
remarks 
on 
the 
subject—many 
of 
them 
to 
be 
found 
only 
in 
posthumously 
published, 
and 
very 
badly 
edited, 
lectures. 
It 
is 
arguable 
that 
all 
three 
philosophers 
were 
wrong 
about 
the 
fourteen 
extant 
plays 
of 
Aeschylus 
and 
Sophocles 
and 
the 
nineteen 
of 
Euripides. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
denying 
that 
Aristotle, 
Hegel, 
and 
Nietzsche 
have 
vastly 
enriched 
the 
discussion 
of 
tragedy—probably 
more 
so 
than 
anyone 
else. 


Secondly, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
does 
not 
deal 
only 
with 
tragedy—nor 
only 
with 
tragedy 
and 
with 
Wagner: 
it 
also 
deals 
with 
the 
relation 
of 
art 
to 
science, 
with 
the 
whole 
phenomenon 
of 
Greek 
civilization, 
and 
with 
the 
modern 
age. 
On 
all 
these 
subjects 
Nietzsche 
has 
much 
to 
say 
that 
is 
interesting, 
and 
a 
good 
deal 
that 
is 
exceptionally 
brilliant 
and 
penetrating. 


Finally, 
some 
of 
the 
distressing 
faults 
of 
the 
essay 
are 
inseparable 
from 
its 
third 
claim 
to 
importance. 
Nietzsche 
was 
probably 
Germany’s 
greatest 
prose 
stylist 
as 
well 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
profound 
and 
influential 
modern 
philosophers. 
But 
much 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
is 
badly 
overwritten 
and 
murky, 
as 
Nietzsche 
himself 
pointed 
out 
in 
section 
3 
of 
his 
“Attempt 
at 
a 



Self-Criticism”; 
and 
occasionally 
a 
more 
extreme 
contrast 
to 
his 
later 
style— 
both 
literary 
and 
philosophical—would 
be 
difficult 
to 
imagine. 
To 
appreciate 
fully 
his 
later 
accomplishment, 
one 
should 
know 
his 
beginnings. 
Indeed, 
it 
is 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
central 
points 
in 
the 
book 
that 
we 
cannot 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
Greeks 
and 
the 
triumph 
of 
those 
powers 
of 
restraint 
that 
he 
calls 
Apollinian 
unless 
we 
first 
behold 
the 
unrestrained 
Dionysian 
energies 
that 
the 
Greeks 
managed 
to 
harness. 
Similarly, 
his 
own 
later 
style, 
so 
remarkable 
for 
its 
lucidity 
and 
aphoristic 
brevity, 
seems 
doubly 
impressive 
when 
we 
compare 
it 
with 
the 
prose 
he 
himself 
found 
so 
embarrassing 
by 
1886—prose 
that 
at 
times, 
particularly 
in 
the 
last 
ten 
sections, 
reads 
like 
a 
parody 
of 
Wagner. 


It 
is 
partly, 
though 
not 
only, 
on 
account 
of 
this 
third 
point 
that 
the 
book 
should 
not 
be 
read 
by 
itself, 
without 
knowledge 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
later 
writings. 
And 
no 
other 
essay 
forms 
as 
perfect 
a 
pair 
with 
it 
as 
the 
exceedingly 
brief 
and 
malicious 
Case 
of 
Wagner, 
here 
offered 
in 
the 
same 
volume. 


One 
corollary 
of 
what 
has 
just 
been 
said 
must 
be 
noted 
expressly. 
Confronted 
with 
the 
occasionally 
hyperromantic 
and 
turgid 
prose 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
it 
is 
tempting 
for 
the 
translator 
to 
tone 
down 
what 
offends 
his 
own 
taste 
and 
to 
make 
the 
style 
leaner 
and 
drier. 
But 
I 
have 
made 
a 
point 
of 
resisting 
this 
temptation. 
To 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
one 
gives 
in 
to 
it, 
one 
makes 
nonsense 
of 
parts 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
brilliant 
“Attempt 
at 
a 
Self-
Criticism,” 
and 
one 
deprives 
those 
interested 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
development 
of 
the 
opportunity 
to 
see 
for 
themselves 
to 
what 
extent 
Nietzsche 
changed. 
A 
faithful 
translator 
should 
strive 
to 
let 
Rilke 
sound 
like 
Rilke, 
Heidegger 
like 
Heidegger, 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 
like 
Der 
Fall 
Wagner—and 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
like 
Die 
Geburt 
der 
Tragödie.

The 
first 
edition 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
was 
published 
in 
1872, 
when 
Nietzsche 
was 
twenty-seven. 
It 
was 
immediately 
attacked 
by 
a 
young 
philologist, 
Ulrich 
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, 
in 
an 
unbridled 
polemical 
pamphlet 
entitled 
Zukunftsphilologie!1 
Wagner’s 
music 
was 
then 
called 
“music 
of 
the 
future,” 
and 
Wilam-owitz 
tried 
to 
expose 
Nietzsche’s 
“philology 
of 
the 
future”—a 
philology 
devoid 
of 
Greek 
quotations 
and 
footnotes. 


Actually, 
there 
was 
much 
more 
to 
the 
attack 
than 
this. 
Nietzsche 
had 
been 
called 
to 
a 
chair 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Basel 
in 
Switzerland 
in 
1869, 
and 
promoted 
to 
a 
full 
professorship 
of 
classical 
philology 
the 
following 
year—at 
the 
age 
of 
twenty-five. 
His 
doctoral 
degree 
had 
been 
conferred 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Leipzig 
without 
his 
having 
written 
a 
dissertation, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
call 
to 
Basel. 
That 
call, 
in 
turn, 
had 
been 
based 
on 
a 
superlative 
recommendation 
by 
Professor 
Ritschl, 
who 
had 
published 
articles 
by 
Nietzsche 
in 
the 
philological 
journal 
he 
edited 
and 
who 
had 
informed 
Basel 
that 
Nietzsche 
“is 
the 
first 
from 
whom 
I 
have 
ever 
accepted 
any 
contribution 
at 
all 
while 
he 
was 
still 
a 
student.” 
The 
tenor 
of 
Ritschl’s 
estimate 
of 
Nietzsche 
is 
perhaps 
best 
summed 
up 
in 
his 
sentence: 
“He 
will 
simply 
be 
able 
to 
do 
anything 
he 
wants 
to 
do.”2 
Nietzsche’s 
appointment 
to 
a 
chair 
at 
twenty-four 
was 
a 
sensation 
in 
professional 
circles, 
and 
it 
was 
to 
be 
expected 
that 
in 
his 
first 
book 
he 
would 
try 
to 
show 
the 
world 
of 
classical 
philology 
that 
his 
meteoric 
rise 
had 
been 
justified. 
Instead—he 
published 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
the 
kind 
of 
volume 
that 
could 
not 
be 
expected 
to 
appeal 
to 
the 
guild 
at 
any 
time, 
least 
of 
all 
to 
German 
professors 
in 
the 
new 
Empire, 
founded 
the 
year 
before. 


Wilamowitz 
(1848–1931) 
was 
four 
years 
Nietzsche’s 
junior, 
had 
just 
received 
his 
doctorate 
but 
not 
yet 
the 
title 
of 
professor—and 
the 
attack 
on 
Nietzsche 
was 
his 
first 
“book.” 
He 
did 
try 
to 
establish 
the 
range 
and 
solidity 
of 
his 
scholarship 
by 
cataloguing 
Nietzsche’s 
faults—and 
he 
saw 
nothing 
good 
at 
all 
in 
The 
Birth. 
His 
attack 
culminated 
in 
a 
charge 
of 
“ignorance 
and 
lack 
of 
love 
of 
truth” 
(p. 
32). 



Nietzsche’s 
friend 
Erwin 
Rohde 
replied, 
still 
in 
1872, 
in 
a 
pamphlet 
he 
called 
Afterphilologie3 
to 
signify 
a 
perversion 
of 
philology. 
Luther 
had 
liked 
the 
prefix 
After, 
which 
refers 
literally 
to 
the 
human 
posterior; 
Kant, 
too, 
had 
used 
it 
in 
his 
book 
on 
religion 
(1793); 
and 
Schopenhauer 
had 
spoken 
of 
Afterphilosophie 
when 
he 
attacked 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
universities. 
Rohde 
tried 
to 
show 
how 
many 
of 
the 
mistakes 
Wilamowitz 
claimed 
to 
have 
found 
in 
The 
Birth 
involved 
errors 
on 
his 
part. 
But 
Rohde 
also 
called 
Wilamowitz 
repeatedly 
“our 
Dr. 
phil.” 
(our 
Ph.D.)—Rohde 
himself 
had 
just 
received 
the 
title 
of 
professor, 
though 
he 
was 
not 
yet 
a 
full 
professor—and 
“the 
pasquinader”;4 
and 
the 
level 
of 
his 
polemic 
was 
no 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
the 
attack 
he 
sought 
to 
meet. 
Two 
quotations 
may 
show 
this: 


“I 
have 
emphasized 
this 
example 
because 
it 
may 
serve 
you 
as 
a 
sample 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
throughout 
this 
pasquinade 
ignorance, 
the 
art 
of 
eager 
slander, 
and 
speculative 
reliance 
on 
the 
blind 
prejudices 
of 
the 
general 
reader 
are 
woven 
together 
into 
an 
attractive 
whole” 
(p. 
10). 


“… 
really 
no 
more 
similar 
than 
an 
ape 
is 
to 
Heracles—indeed, 
even 
less; 
about 
as 
similar 
as 
our 
Dr. 
phil. 
von 
Wilamowitz 
is 
to 
the 
type 
of 
the 
‘Socratic 
man’ 
whom 
our 
friend 
[Nietzsche] 
designates 
as 
the 
‘noblest 
opponent’ 
of 
an 
artistic 
culture, 
although 
our 
Dr. 
phil. 
rather 
amusingly 
supposes 
that 
the 
designation 
fits 
him 
and 
the 
likes 
of 
him” 
(p. 
12). 


This 
last 
passage 
is 
important 
because 
it 
also 
illustrates 
Nietzsche’s 
high 
esteem 
of 
the 
“Socratic 
man.” 
Afterphilologie, 
to 
be 
sure, 
was 
written 
by 
Rohde, 
not 
Nietzsche; 
but 
the 
two 
men 
were 
very 
close 
friends 
at 
that 
time, 
and 
the 
point 
of 
Rohde’s 
pamphlet 
was 
to 
expose 
misinterpretations 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy. 


In 
1873 
Wilamowitz 
replied 
once 
more 
with 
a 
sequel 
to 
his 
Zukunftsphilologie.5) 
The 
tenor 
of 
his 
reply 
may 
be 
gleaned 
from 
a 
remark 
near 
the 
end: 
“I 
should 
waste 
my 
time 
and 
energy 
on 
the 
inanities 
and 
wretchednesses 
of 
a 
couple 
of 
rotted 
brains?” 
(p. 
23). 
Later, 
both 
Wilamowitz 
and 
Rohde 
made 
great 
reputations 
as 
classical 
philologists 
and 
never 
reprinted 
these 
early 
essays—presumably 
because 
they 
felt 
embarrassed 
by 
them. 


Rohde, 
incidentally, 
had 
published 
a 
review 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
in 
the 
Norddeutsche 
allgemeine 
Zeitung, 
Sunday, 
May 
26, 
1872, 
before 
Wilamowitz’s 
pamphlet 
appeared. 
And 
in 
1882 
he 
published 
a 
very 
critical 
and 
hostile 
review 
of 
Wilamowitz’s 
Antigonos 
von 
Karystos 
(1881) 
in 
the 
Litterarische 
Centralblatt. 
Both 
of 
these 
reviews 
were 
reprinted 
in 
his 
Kleine 



Schriften 
(2 
vols, 
1901). 


Nietzsche 
never 
referred 
to 
Wilamowitz 
in 
any 
of 
his 
works 
and 
went 
his 
own 
way 
without 
letting 
resentment 
eat 
into 
his 
soul. 
There 
are 
a 
few 
references 
to 
Wilamowitz 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
letters 
of 
1872 
and 
1873; 
but 
the 
most 
revealing 
passage 
is 
found 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Rohde, 
March 
19, 
1874: 


“To 
refute 
Dräseke’s6 
contribution 
to 
the 
question 
of 
Wagner, 
of 
belly-
shaking 
memory, 
Herr 
Bruno 
Meier7 
has 
written 
a 
lengthy 
and 
weighty 
treatise 
in 
which 
I 
am 
solemnly 
denounced 
as 
an 
‘enemy 
of 
our 
culture,’ 
besides 
being 
represented 
as 
a 
wily 
deceiver 
among 
those 
who 
are 
deceived. 
He 
sent 
me 
his 
treatise 
personally, 
even 
furnishing 
his 
home 
address; 
I 
will 
send 
him 
the 
two 
essays 
of 
Wilamops. 
That’s 
surely 
Christian 
beneficence 
toward 
one’s 
enemies. 
For 
the 
delight 
of 
this 
dear 
Meier 
over 
Wilamops 
will 
surpass 
all 
words.” 


To 
explain 
Nietzsche’s 
nickname 
for 
Wilamowitz: 
Mops 
is 
the 
German 
word 
for 
a 
pug, 
but 
the 
term 
was 
actually 
used 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
person 
with 
a 
disgruntled 
facial 
expression 
before 
it 
was 
transferred 
to 
the 
dog; 
it 
designates 
the 
quintessence 
of 
the 
comic, 
stupid, 
coarse, 
unfriendly, 
and 
inelegant. 
Mopsig 
means 
“boring”; 
sich 
mopsen, 
“to 
be 
bored.” 
Mops 
seems 
to 
be 
related 
etymologically 
to 
the 
English 
“mope.” 


Nietzsche 
took 
Wilamowitz’s 
attack 
very 
lightly; 
yet 
it 
has 
been 
claimed 
that 
Wilamowitz 
finished 
Nietzsche 
as 
a 
philologist, 
and 
even 
that 
Nietzsche 
retired 
in 
1879, 
after 
only 
ten 
years 
as 
a 
professor, 
because 
the 
students 
stayed 
away 
as 
a 
result 
of 
Wilamowitz’s 
polemics. 
In 
fact, 
the 
size 
of 
enrollments 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
decision. 


It 
may 
be 
of 
some 
interest 
to 
indicate 
what 
he 
taught 
and 
to 
note 
how 
few 
students 
he 
had 
all 
along. 
During 
his 
first 
year 
he 
gave 
the 
following 
courses 
(the 
number 
of 
students 
is 
indicated 
in 
each 
case 
in 
parentheses): 
Aeschylus’ 
Choephori 
(6), 
Greek 
Lyric 
Poets 
(7), 
Latin 
Grammar 
(8). 
The 
next 
year: 
Sophocles’ 
Oedipus 
Rex 
(11), 
Metrics 
(5), 
Hesiod’s 
Erga 
(11). 
The 
third 
year: 
Introduction 
to 
the 
Study 
of 
Philology 
(9), 
Introduction 
to 
the 
Study 
of 
Plato’s 
Dialogues 
(6), 
Introduction 
to 
Latin 
Epigraphy 
(9). 
In 
the 
summer 
of 
1872, 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
The 
Birth, 
Nietzsche 
lectured 
on 
Pre-Platonic 
Philosophers 
(10) 
and 
Aeschylus 
Choephori 
(7); 
but 
that 
winter 
he 
had 
only 
two 
students 
in 
his 
Greek 
and 
Roman 
Rhetoric, 
and 
neither 
was 
a 
philologist. 
This 
drop 
in 
the 
number 
of 
students 
was 
surely 
due 
to 
Wilamowitz’s 
first 
polemic. 
By 
the 
next 
summer, 
however, 
his 
lectures 
on 
the 
Pre-Platonic 
Philosophers 
drew 
eleven 
students; 
in 
1876 
the 
same 
course 
drew 
ten, 
and 
his 



lectures 
On 
Plato’s 
Life 
and 
Doctrines 
nineteen. 
In 
1878, 
finally, 
just 
before 
his 
retirement, 
he 
had 
more 
students 
than 
ever, 
though 
certainly 
not 
many: 
Hesiod’s 
Works 
and 
Days 
(13), 
Plato’s 
Apology 
of 
Socrates 
(6), 
Greek 
Lyrical 
Poets 
(13), 
Introduction 
to 
the 
Study 
of 
Plato 
(8). 
These 
data 
may 
give 
some 
idea 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
career 
as 
a 
professor 
of 
classical 
philology, 
which 
was 
not 
exhausted 
by 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy. 


About 
the 
book 
opinions 
still 
differ, 
as 
they 
do 
about 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works. 
F. 
M. 
Cornford, 
one 
of 
the 
leading 
British 
classicists 
of 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
known 
to 
generations 
of 
students 
for 
his 
translations 
of 
many 
Platonic 
dialogues 
and 
his 
remarkable 
commentaries, 
said 
in 
From 
Religion 
to 
Philosophy 
(1912) 
that 
The 
Birth 
was 
“a 
work 
of 
profound 
imaginative 
insight, 
which 
left 
the 
scholarship 
of 
a 
generation 
toiling 
in 
the 
rear.” 


For 
all 
that, 
Wilamowitz 
had 
a 
point, 
though 
he 
was 
completely 
blind 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
merits. 
Some 
of 
the 
“philology” 
of 
the 
future 
aped 
the 
manifest 
defects 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
book 
without 
partaking 
of 
his 
genius—and, 
by 
a 
remarkable 
irony 
of 
fate, 
Nietzsche 
himself 
was 
to 
suffer 
a 
great 
deal, 
posthumously, 
from 
pseudo-scholars 
who 
substituted 
effusive 
prose 
for 
precision 
and 
correctness. 


On 
the 
whole, 
however, 
the 
general 
estimate 
of 
posterity 
has 
been 
much 
closer 
to 
Cornford’s 
view, 
and 
he 
himself 
and 
Jane 
Harrison 
have 
done 
a 
good 
deal 
to 
sustain 
Nietzsche’s 
central 
intuitions. 


In 
1965 
Professor 
Gerald 
F. 
Else 
followed 
up 
his 
monumental 
analysis 
of 
Aristotle’s 
Poetics 
(1957) 
with 
a 
short 
study 
of 
The 
Origin 
and 
Early 
Form 
of 
Greek 
Tragedy8 
in 
which 
he 
argues 
that 
Aristotle, 
Nietzsche, 
Gilbert 
Murray, 
and 
the 
Cambridge 
school 
have 
all 
been 
importantly 
wrong 
about 
the 
origin 
of 
tragedy. 
He 
shows 
his 
usual 
mastery 
of 
the 
whole 
literature, 
and 
in 
his 
notes 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
volume 
he 
gives 
abundant 
references 
to 
recent 
literature 
on 
the 
subject. 
Those 
wondering 
about 
the 
current 
status 
of 
some 
of 
the 
problems 
raised 
by 
Nietzsche 
may 
be 
referred 
to 
Else’s 
work. 
But 
it 
is 
noteworthy 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
his 
radical 
disagreement 
with 
Nietzsche, 
Else 
should 
say, 
“The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
is 
a 
great 
book, 
by 
whatever 
standard 
one 
cares 
to 
measure 
it” 
(p. 
10). 
And 
he 
adds: 
“The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
has 
cast 
a 
spell 
on 
almost 
everybody 
who 
has 
dealt 
with 
the 
subject 
since 
1871.”

What 
is 
of 
lasting 
importance 
is 
not 
the 
contrast 
of 
the 
Apollinian9 
and 
Dionysian 
as 
such: 
that 
smacks 
of 
Schopenhauer’s 
contrast 
of 
the 
world 
as 
representation 
and 
the 
world 
as 
will; 
and 
playing 
off 
two 
concepts 
against 
each 
other 
like 
that 
is 
rarely 
very 
fruitful, 
though 
it 
has 
been 
a 
popular 
pastime 
among 
German 
scholars. 


When 
The 
Birth 
appeared, 
the 
prevalent 
conception 
of 
the 
Greeks 
was 
still 
that 
pioneered 
by 
Johann 
Joachim 
Winckelmann 
(1717–1768) 
and 
adopted 
by 
Goethe 
(1749–1832): 
edle 
Einfalt, 
stille 
Grösse, 
“noble 
simplicity, 
calm 
grandeur.” 
Matthew 
Arnold 
(1822–1888), 
utterly 
unable 
as 
a 
critic 
to 
maintain 
the 
level 
of 
his 
poem 
“Dover 
Beach,” 
had 
only 
recently 
led 
this 
view 
to 
the 
absurd 
with 
his 
famous 
formulation: 
“sweetness 
and 
light.”10 
Nietzsche 
used 
Apollo 
as 
a 
symbol 
for 
this 
aspect 
of 
Greek 
culture 
which 
found 
superb 
expression 
in 
classical 
Greek 
temples 
and 
sculptures: 
the 
genius 
of 
restraint, 
measure, 
and 
harmony. 
Far 
from 
depreciating 
what 
he 
called 
“the 
Apollinian,” 
he 
argued 
that 
one 
could 
not 
appreciate 
it 
sufficiently 
until 
one 
became 
aware 
of 
another 
side 
of 
Greek 
culture 
that 
was 
barbarous 
by 
comparison 
and 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
Dionysian 
festivals. 
Surely, 
The 
Bacchae 
of 
Euripides 
shows 
us 
passions 
that 
are 
worlds 
removed 
from 
the 
Greece 
of 
Winckelmann, 
Goethe, 
and 
Arnold; 
and 
Nietzsche 
claimed 
that 
the 
same 
boundless 
and 
cruel 
longing 
to 
exceed 
all 
norms 
is 
also 
occasionally 
encountered 
in 
the 
Iliad11 
and 
in 
subsequent 
Greek 
poetry—and 
“the 
birth 
of 
tragedy” 
cannot 
be 
understood 
apart 
from 
it. 


A 
careful 
reading 
of 
The 
Birth 
shows 
that 
Nietzsche, 
far 
from 
glorifying 
“the 
Dionysian,” 
argues 
that 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
Greeks 
generally, 
and 
their 
tragedies 
in 
particular, 
cannot 
be 
understood 
adequately 
so 
long 
as 
we 
do 
not 
realize 
what 
potentially 
destructive 
forces 
had 
to 
be 
harnessed 
to 
make 
them 
possible. 
On 
this 
central 
point 
Nietzsche 
was 
surely 
right. 
If 
one 
wants 
a 
single 
well-written 
book 
which 
abounds 
in 
quotations 
and 
references 
that 
document 
this 
“dark” 
side 
of 
ancient 
Greece, 
there 
is 
probably 
none 
better 
than 
E. 
R. 
Dodds’s 
superb 
study 
of 
The 
Greeks 
and 
the 
Irrational,12 
which 
also 
abounds 
in 
references 
to 
other 
recent 
literature 
on 
this 
subject. 



The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
reaches 
its 
first 
great 
climax 
in 
section 
7, 
which 
is 
of 
interest 
also 
in 
connection 
with 
French 
existentialism. 
Then 
the 
book 
moves 
on 
to 
suggestions 
about 
the 
death 
of 
tragedy. 
For 
over 
forty 
years 
the 
ridiculous 
claims 
of 
Richard 
Oehler, 
in 
Friedrich 
Nietzsche 
und 
die 
Vorsokratiker 
(1904),13 
were 
repeated 
by 
one 
interpreter 
after 
another—even 
after 
Oehler 
had 
thoroughly 
discredited 
himself 
with 
one 
of 
the 
most 
unscrupulous 
books 
ever 
to 
have 
come 
from 
a 
writer 
with 
some 
scholarly 
pretensions, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsche 
und 
die 
Deutsche 
Zukunft 
(1935),14 
an 
attempt 
to 
identify 
Nietzsche 
with 
the 
aspirations 
of 
the 
Nazis, 
who 
had 
come 
to 
power 
in 
1933. 
In 
the 
interim, 
Oehler 
had 
compiled 
two 
huge 
indices 
for 
the 
two 
most 
complete 
editions 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works, 
the 
latter 
index 
(for 
the 
so-called 
Musarion 
edition) 
comprising 
two 
and 
a 
half 
volumes. 
This 
did 
not 
prevent 
him—on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
enabled 
him 
to 
stud 
his 
book 
of 
1935 
with 
utterly 
misleading 
quotations 
that 
seem 
to 
say 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
Nietzsche 
actually 
says 
on 
the 
pages 
from 
which 
they 
are 
taken. 
At 
best 
the 
earlier 
volume 
shows 
that 
Oehler’s 
stunning 
lack 
of 
intellectual 
integrity 
was 
fused 
with 
a 
limited 
intelligence 
and 
an 
appalling 
inability 
to 
understand 
Nietzsche. 
But 
this 
man 
was 
one 
of 
the 
pillars 
of 
the 
Nietzsche 
Archive, 
established 
by 
the 
philosopher’s 
sister, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
editors 
of 
the 
works.15 


Neither 
Oehler 
nor 
his 
early 
book 
would 
deserve 
mention 
here 
if 
that 
book 
had 
not 
been 
used 
and 
echoed 
uncritically 
by 
A. 
H. 
J. 
Knight 
in 
the 
only 
English 
full-length 
study 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
relation 
to 
the 
Greeks,16 
and 
if 
Knight 
had 
not 
been 
relied 
on 
uncritically 
by 
Ernest 
Newman, 
Crane 
Brinton, 
and 
Erich 
Podach.17 
To 
catalogue 
Oehler’s 
mistakes 
here 
would 
be 
pointless; 
but 
two 
of 
them 
have 
been 
repeated 
so 
often 
that 
it 
seems 
necessary 
to 
repudiate 
them 
specifically. 


First, 
the 
young 
Oehler 
claimed 
that 
the 
early 
Nietzsche 
“was 
completely 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
Schopenhauer,” 
and 
a 
pessimist 
(p. 
28). 
In 
fact, 
however, 
Nietzsche’s 
very 
first 
book, 
The 
Birth, 
constitutes 
a 
declaration 
of 
independence 
from 
Schopenhauer: 
while 
Nietzsche 
admires 
him 
for 
honestly 
facing 
up 
to 
the 
terrors 
of 
existence, 
Nietzsche 
himself 
celebrates 
Greek 
tragedy 
as 
a 
superior 
alternative 
to 
Schopenhauer’s 
“Buddhistic 
negation 
of 
the 
will.” 
From 
tragedy 
Nietzsche 
learns 
that 
one 
can 
affirm 
life 
as 
sublime, 
beautiful, 
and 
joyous 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
suffering 
and 
cruelty. 


Second, 
Oehler 
understood 
The 
Birth 
as 
a 
manifesto 
against 
Socrates 
and 
Socratism. 
In 
fact, 
Nietzsche 
is 
no 
more 
against 
(or 
for) 
Socrates 
than 
he 
is 
against 
(or 
for) 
Apollo 
or 
Dionysus. 
His 
whole 
way 
of 
thinking 
is 
far 



removed 
from 
such 
crudities. 
And 
Nietzsche 
was 
as 
right 
as 
most 
of 
his 
interpreters, 
following 
Oehler, 
have 
been 
wrong 
when 
he 
said 
in 
1888, 
in 
Ecce 
Homo, 
in 
the 
first 
section 
of 
his 
own 
analysis 
of 
The 
Birth: 
“It 
smells 
offensively 
Hegelian, 
and 
the 
cadaverous 
perfume 
of 
Schopenhauer 
sticks 
only 
to 
a 
few 
formulas.” 


Socrates 
is 
introduced 
in 
The 
Birth 
with 
the 
reverence 
befitting 
a 
god, 
the 
equal 
of 
Apollo 
and 
Dionysus. 
Of 
course, 
Nietzsche’s 
critical 
powers 
do 
not 
spare 
even 
gods, 
and 
he 
finds 
Socrates 
deeply 
problematic. 
He 
always 
approached 
Socrates 
in 
this 
manner, 
stressing 
now 
his 
admiration, 
now 
his 
objections, 
and 
sometimes, 
as 
here, 
both 
at 
once.18 
Indeed, 
the 
two 
sections 
(14 
and 
15) 
in 
which 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
death 
of 
tragedy 
reaches 
its 
climax 
—the 
second 
great 
highpoint 
of 
the 
book—suggest 
that 
but 
for 
Socrates 
Greek 
culture 
might 
have 
perished 
altogether; 
also 
that 
“the 
influence 
of 
Socrates 
necessitates 
ever 
again 
the 
regeneration 
of 
art”; 
and 
finally 
even 
that 
we 
need 
an 
“artistic 
Socrates.” 


Apollo 
and 
Dionysus 
reached 
a 
synthesis 
in 
tragedy; 
this 
synthesis 
was 
negated 
by 
Socrates; 
and 
now 
another 
synthesis 
is 
wanted, 
an 
artistic 
Socrates. 
Could 
Plato 
be 
meant? 
On 
the 
contrary. 
Those 
who 
feel 
that 
Nietzsche 
is 
unfair 
to 
Socrates 
and 
that 
Socratism 
is 
not 
opposed 
to 
tragedy 
should 
reconsider 
Plato’s 
resolve, 
in 
the 
Republic, 
to 
tolerate 
no 
tragic 
poets 
in 
his 
ideal 
city, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
older 
Plato’s 
remarks 
on 
tragedy 
in 
The 
Laws. 
The 
“artistic 
Socrates” 
is 
Nietzsche 
himself. 
He 
looks 
forward 
to 
a 
philosophy 
that 
admits 
the 
tragic 
aspect 
of 
life, 
as 
the 
Greek 
poets 
did, 
but 
does 
not 
sacrifice 
the 
critical 
intellect; 
a 
philosophy 
that 
denies 
Socrates’ 
optimistic 
faith 
that 
knowledge 
and 
virtue 
and 
happiness 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
Siamese 
triplets; 
a 
philosophy 
as 
sharply 
critical 
as 
Socrates’ 
but 
able 
and 
willing 
to 
avail 
itself 
of 
the 
visions 
and 
resources 
of 
art. 


For 
all 
that, 
one 
need 
not 
accept 
Nietzsche’s 
view 
of 
the 
death 
of 
tragedy, 
though 
it 
has 
been 
served 
up 
to 
us 
again 
and 
again 
in 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
offer 
sustained 
criticisms 
of 
his 
theses; 
but 
to 
stimulate 
reflection 
I 
suggest 
that 
Nietzsche 
is 
blatantly 
unfair 
not 
to 
Socrates 
but 
to 
Euripides—and 
that 
the 
death 
of 
tragedy 
was 
far 
better 
explained 
by 
Goethe, 
when 
he 
said 
to 
Eckermann, 
May 
1, 
1825: 


“Man 
is 
simple. 
And 
however 
rich, 
manifold, 
and 
unfathomable 
he 
may 
be, 
yet 
the 
circle 
of 
his 
states 
is 
soon 
run 
through. 
If 
the 
circumstances 
had 
been 
like 
those 
among 
us 
poor 
Germans 
where 
Lessing 
wrote 
two 
or 
three, 
I 
myself 
three 
or 
four, 
and 
Schiller 
five 
or 
six 
passable 
plays, 
there 
would 
have 



been 
room 
for 
a 
fourth, 
fifth, 
and 
sixth 
tragic 
poet. 
But 
among 
the 
Greeks 
with 
their 
abundant 
production, 
where 
each 
of 
the 
three 
great 
ones 
had 
written 
over 
one 
hundred, 
or 
close 
to 
one 
hundred, 
plays, 
and 
the 
tragic 
subjects 
of 
Homer 
and 
the 
heroic 
tradition 
had 
in 
some 
cases 
been 
treated 
three 
or 
four 
times—in 
view 
of 
such 
an 
abundance, 
I 
say, 
one 
may 
suppose 
that 
subject 
matter 
and 
contents 
had 
gradually 
been 
exhausted 
and 
poets 
writing 
after 
the 
three 
great 
ones 
did 
not 
really 
know 
what 
next. 
And 
when 
you 
stop 
to 
think 
about 
it, 
why 
should 
they? 
Wasn’t 
it 
really 
enough 
for 
a 
while? 
… 
After 
all, 
these 
few 
grandiose 
views 
that 
have 
come 
down 
to 
us 
are 
of 
such 
dimension 
and 
significance 
that 
we 
poor 
Europeans 
have 
been 
occupying 
ourselves 
with 
them 
for 
centuries 
and 
will 
yet 
have 
food 
and 
work 
enough 
for 
a 
few 
more 
centuries.” 


Unfortunately, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
does 
not 
end 
with 
Section 
15, 
as 
an 
early 
draft 
did 
and 
as 
the 
book 
clearly 
ought 
to. 
Another 
ten 
sections 
follow 
that 
weaken 
the 
whole 
book 
immeasurably. 


Sections 
1 
through 
6 
are 
introductory 
and 
inferior 
stylistically. 
The 
heart 
of 
the 
book 
is 
found 
in 
Sections 
7 
through 
15, 
which 
deal 
with 
the 
birth 
and 
death 
of 
tragedy. 
This 
is 
by 
far 
the 
best 
part 
of 
the 
book 
and 
can 
probably 
be 
understood 
fairly 
well 
by 
itself. 
Sections 
16–25 
are 
less 
worthy 
of 
Nietzsche 
than 
anything 
else 
of 
comparable 
length 
he 
ever 
published—and 
he 
himself 
soon 
felt 
this. 
The 
book 
as 
a 
whole, 
though 
it 
has 
a 
touch 
of 
genius, 
is 
marred 
by 
the 
faults 
Nietzsche 
enumerates 
in 
his 
“Attempt 
at 
a 
Self-Criticism.” 
This 
“Attempt,” 
however, 
shows 
us 
not 
only 
a 
brilliant 
writer 
who 
has 
grown 
far 
beyond 
the 
level 
of 
his 
first 
performance, 
but 
a 
great 
human 
being.

The 
BIRTH

Attempt 
at 
a 
Self-Criticism 


Whatever 
may 
be 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
this 
questionable 
book, 
it 
must 
have 
been 
an 
exceptionally 
significant 
and 
fascinating 
question, 
and 
deeply 
personal 
at 
that: 
the 
time 
in 
which 
it 
was 
written, 
in 
spite 
of 
which 
it 
was 
written, 
bears 
witness 
to 
that—the 
exciting 
time 
of 
the 
Franco-Prussian 
War 
of 
1870/71. 
As 
the 
thunder 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Wörth 
was 
rolling 
over 
Europe, 
the 
muser 
and 
riddle-friend 
who 
was 
to 
be 
the 
father 
of 
this 
book 
sat 
somewhere 
in 
an 
Alpine 
nook, 
very 
bemused 
and 
beriddled, 
hence 
very 
concerned 
and 
yet 
unconcerned, 
and 
wrote 
down 
his 
thoughts 
about 
the 
Greeks—the 
core 
of 
the 
strange 
and 
almost 
inaccessible 
book 
to 
which 
this 
belated 
preface 
(or 
postscript) 
shall 
now 
be 
added. 
A 
few 
weeks 
later—and 
he 
himself 
was 
to 
be 
found 
under 
the 
walls 
of 
Metz, 
still 
wedded 
to 
the 
question 
marks 
that 
he 
had 
placed 
after 
the 
alleged 
“cheerfulness” 
of 
the 
Greeks 
and 
of 
Greek 
art. 
Eventually, 
in 
that 
month 
of 
profoundest 
suspense 
when 
the 
peace 
treaty 
was 
being 
debated 
at 
Versailles, 
he, 
too, 
attained 
peace 
with 
himself 
and, 
slowly 
convalescing 
from 
an 
illness 
contracted 
at 
the 
front, 
completed 
the 
final 
draft 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
out 
of 
the 
Spirit 
of 
Music.— 
Out 
of 
music? 
Music 
and 
tragedy? 
Greeks 
and 
the 
music 
of 
tragedy? 
Greeks 
and 
the 
art 
form 
of 
pessimism? 
The 
best 
turned 
out, 
most 
beautiful, 
most 
envied 
type 
of 
humanity 
to 
date, 
those 
most 
apt 
to 
seduce 
us 
to 
life, 
the 
Greeks—how 
now? 
They 
of 
all 
people 
should 
have 
needed 
tragedy? 
Even 
more—art? 
For 
what— 
Greek 
art? 


You 
will 
guess 
where 
the 
big 
question 
mark 
concerning 
the 
value 
of 
existence 
had 
thus 
been 
raised. 
Is 
pessimism 
necessarily 
a 
sign 
of 
decline, 
decay, 
degeneration, 
weary 
and 
weak 
instincts—as 
it 
once 
was 
in 
India 
and 
now 
is, 
to 
all 
appearances, 
among 
us, 
“modern” 
men 
and 
Europeans? 
Is 
there 
a 
pessimism 
of 
strength? 
An 
intellectual 
predilection 
for 
the 
hard, 
gruesome, 
evil, 
problematic 
aspect 
of 
existence, 
prompted 
by 
well-being, 
by 
overflowing 
health, 
by 
the 
fullness 
of 
existence? 
Is 
it 
perhaps 
possible 
to 
suffer 
precisely 
from 
overfullness? 
The 
sharp-eyed 
courage 
that 
tempts 
and 
attempts, 
that 
craves 
the 
frightful 
as 
the 
enemy, 
the 
worthy 
enemy, 
against 
whom 
one 
can 
test 
one’s 
strength? 
From 
whom 
one 
can 
learn 
what 
it 
means 
“to 
be 
frightened”? 
What 
is 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
tragic 
myth 
among 
the 
Greeks 
of 
the 
best, 
the 
strongest, 
the 
most 
courageous 
period? 
And 
the 



tremendous 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
Dionysian—and, 
born 
from 
it, 
tragedy— 
what 
might 
they 
signify?— 
And 
again: 
that 
of 
which 
tragedy 
died, 
the 
Socratism 
of 
morality, 
the 
dialectics, 
frugality, 
and 
cheerfulness 
of 
the 
theoretical 
man—how 
now? 
might 
not 
this 
very 
Socratism 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
decline, 
of 
weariness, 
of 
infection, 
of 
the 
anarchical 
dissolution 
of 
the 
instincts? 
And 
the 
“Greek 
cheerfulness” 
of 
the 
later 
Greeks—merely 
the 
afterglow 
of 
the 
sunset? 
The 
Epicureans’ 
resolve 
against 
pessimism—a 
mere 
precaution 
of 
the 
afflicted? 
And 
science 
itself, 
our 
science—indeed, 
what 
is 
the 
significance 
of 
all 
science, 
viewed 
as 
a 
symptom 
of 
life? 
For 
what— 
worse 
yet, 
whence—all 
science? 
How 
now? 
Is 
the 
resolve 
to 
be 
so 
scientific 
about 
everything 
perhaps 
a 
kind 
of 
fear 
of, 
an 
escape 
from, 
pessimism? 
A 
subtle 
last 
resort 
against—truth? 
And, 
morally 
speaking, 
a 
sort 
of 
cowardice 
and 
falseness? 
Amorally 
speaking, 
a 
ruse? 
O 
Socrates, 
Socrates, 
was 
that 
perhaps 
your 
secret? 
O 
enigmatic 
ironist, 
was 
that 
perhaps 
your—irony? 



2 


What 
I 
then 
got 
hold 
of, 
something 
frightful 
and 
dangerous, 
a 
problem 
with 
horns 
but 
not 
necessarily 
a 
bull, 
in 
any 
case 
a 
new 
problem—today 
I 
should 
say 
that 
it 
was 
the 
problem 
of 
science 
itself, 
science 
considered 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
problematic, 
as 
questionable. 
But 
the 
book 
in 
which 
my 
youthful 
courage 
and 
suspicion 
found 
an 
outlet—what 
an 
impossible 
book 
had 
to 
result 
from 
a 
task 
so 
uncongenial 
to 
youth! 
Constructed 
from 
a 
lot 
of 
immature, 
overgreen 
personal 
experiences, 
all 
of 
them 
close 
to 
the 
limits 
of 
communication, 
presented 
in 
the 
context 
of 
art—for 
the 
problem 
of 
science 
cannot 
be 
recognized 
in 
the 
context 
of 
science—a 
book 
perhaps 
for 
artists 
who 
also 
have 
an 
analytic 
and 
retrospective 
penchant 
(in 
other 
words, 
an 
exceptional 
type 
of 
artist 
for 
whom 
one 
might 
have 
to 
look 
far 
and 
wide 
and 
really 
would 
not 
care 
to 
look); 
a 
book 
full 
of 
psychological 
innovations 
and 
artists’ 
secrets, 
with 
an 
artists’ 
metaphysics 
in 
the 
background; 
a 
youthful 
work 
full 
of 
the 
intrepid 
mood 
of 
youth, 
the 
moodiness 
of 
youth, 
independent, 
defiantly 
self-reliant 
even 
where 
it 
seems 
to 
bow 
before 
an 
authority 
and 
personal 
reverence; 
in 
sum, 
a 
first 
book, 
also 
in 
every 
bad 
sense 
of 
that 
label. 
In 
spite 
of 
the 
problem 
which 
seems 
congenial 
to 
old 
age, 
the 
book 
is 
marked 
by 
every 
defect 
of 
youth, 
with 
its 
“length 
in 
excess” 
and 
its 
“storm 
and 
stress.” 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
considering 
its 
success 
(especially 
with 
the 
great 
artist 
to 
whom 
it 
addressed 
itself 
as 
in 
a 
dialogue, 
Richard 
Wagner), 
it 
is 
a 
proven 
book, 
I 
mean 
one 
that 
in 
any 
case 
satisfied 
“the 
best 
minds 
of 
the 
time.”1 
In 
view 
of 
that, 
it 
really 
ought 
to 
be 
treated 
with 
some 
consideration 
and 
taciturnity. 
Still, 
I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
suppress 
entirely 
how 
disagreeable 
it 
now 
seems 
to 
me, 
how 
strange 
it 
appears 
now, 
after 
sixteen 
years—before 
a 
much 
older, 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
demanding, 
but 
by 
no 
means 
colder 
eye 
which 
has 
not 
become 
a 
stranger 
to 
the 
task 
which 
this 
audacious 
book 
dared 
to 
tackle 
for 
the 
first 
time: 
to 
look 
at 
science 
in 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
artist, 
but 
at 
art 
in 
that 
of 
life. 



3 


To 
say 
it 
once 
more: 
today 
I 
find 
it 
an 
impossible 
book: 
I 
consider 
it 
badly 
written, 
ponderous, 
embarrassing, 
image-mad 
and 
image-confused, 
sentimental, 
in 
places 
saccharine 
to 
the 
point 
of 
effeminacy, 
uneven 
in 
tempo, 
without 
the 
will 
to 
logical 
cleanliness, 
very 
convinced 
and 
therefore 
disdainful 
of 
proof, 
mistrustful 
even 
of 
the 
propriety 
of 
proof, 
a 
book 
for 
initiates, 
“music” 
for 
those 
dedicated 
to 
music, 
those 
who 
are 
closely 
related 
to 
begin 
with 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
common 
and 
rare 
aesthetic 
experiences, 
“music” 
meant 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
recognition 
for 
close 
relatives 
in 
artibus2—an 
arrogant 
and 
rhapsodic 
book 
that 
sought 
to 
exclude 
right 
from 
the 
beginning 
the 
profanum 
vulgus3 
of 
“the 
educated” 
even 
more 
than 
“the 
mass” 
or 
“folk.” 
Still, 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
book 
proved 
and 
proves 
that 
it 
had 
a 
knack 
for 
seeking 
out 
fellow-rhapsodizers 
and 
for 
luring 
them 
on 
to 
new 
secret 
paths 
and 
dancing 
places. 
What 
found 
expression 
here 
was 
anyway—this 
was 
admitted 
with 
as 
much 
curiosity 
as 
antipathy—a 
strange 
voice, 
the 
disciple 
of 
a 
still 
“unknown 
God,” 
one 
who 
concealed 
himself 
for 
the 
time 
being 
under 
the 
scholar’s 
hood, 
under 
the 
gravity 
and 
dialectical 
ill 
humor 
of 
the 
German, 
even 
under 
the 
bad 
manners 
of 
the 
Wagnerian. 
Here 
was 
a 
spirit 
with 
strange, 
still 
nameless 
needs, 
a 
memory 
bursting 
with 
questions, 
experiences, 
concealed 
things 
after 
which 
the 
name 
of 
Dionysus 
was 
added 
as 
one 
more 
question 
mark. 
What 
spoke 
here—as 
was 
admitted, 
not 
without 
suspicion—was 
something 
like 
a 
mystical, 
almost 
maenadic 
soul 
that 
stammered 
with 
difficulty, 
a 
feat 
of 
the 
will, 
as 
in 
a 
strange 
tongue, 
almost 
undecided 
whether 
it 
should 
communicate 
or 
conceal 
itself. 
It 
should 
have 
sung, 
this 
“new 
soul”—and 
not 
spoken!4 
What 
I 
had 
to 
say 
then—too 
bad 
that 
I 
did 
not 
dare 
say 
it 
as 
a 
poet: 
perhaps 
I 
had 
the 
ability. 
Or 
at 
least 
as 
a 
philologist: 
after 
all, 
even 
today 
practically 
everything 
in 
this 
field 
remains 
to 
be 
discovered 
and 
dug 
up 
by 
philologists! 
Above 
all, 
the 
problem 
that 
there 
is 
a 
problem 
here— 
and 
that 
the 
Greeks, 
as 
long 
as 
we 
lack 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
“what 
is 
Dionysian?” 
remain 
as 
totally 
uncomprehended 
and 
unimaginable 
as 
ever.5 



4 


Indeed, 
what 
is 
Dionysian?— 
This 
book 
contains 
an 
answer: 
one 
“who 
knows” 
is 
talking, 
the 
initiate 
and 
disciple 
of 
his 
god. 
Now 
I 
should 
perhaps 
speak 
more 
cautiously 
and 
less 
eloquently 
about 
such 
a 
difficult 
psychological 
question 
as 
that 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
tragedy 
among 
the 
Greeks. 
The 
question 
of 
the 
Greek’s 
relation 
to 
pain, 
his 
degree 
of 
sensitivity, 
is 
basic: 
did 
this 
relation 
remain 
constant? 
Or 
did 
it 
change 
radically? 
The 
question 
is 
whether 
his 
ever 
stronger 
craving 
for 
beauty, 
for 
festivals, 
pleasures, 
new 
cults 
was 
rooted 
in 
some 
deficiency, 
privation, 
melancholy, 
pain? 
Supposing 
that 
this 
were 
true—and 
Pericles 
(or 
Thucydides) 
suggests 
as 
much 
in 
the 
great 
funeral 
oration—how 
should 
we 
then 
have 
to 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
opposite 
craving, 
which 
developed 
earlier 
in 
time, 
the 
craving 
for 
the 
ugly; 
the 
good, 
severe 
will 
of 
the 
older 
Greeks 
to 
pessimism, 
to 
the 
tragic 
myth, 
to 
the 
image 
of 
everything 
underlying 
existence 
that 
is 
frightful, 
evil, 
a 
riddle, 
destructive, 
fatal? 
What, 
then, 
would 
be 
the 
origin 
of 
tragedy? 
Perhaps 
joy, 
strength, 
overflowing 
health, 
overgreat 
fullness? 
And 
what, 
then, 
is 
the 
significance, 
physiologically 
speaking, 
of 
that 
madness 
out 
of 
which 
tragic 
and 
comic 
art 
developed—the 
Dionysian 
madness? 
How 
now? 
Is 
madness 
perhaps 
not 
necessarily 
the 
symptom 
of 
degeneration, 
decline, 
and 
the 
final 
stage 
of 
culture? 
Are 
there 
perhaps—a 
question 
for 
psychiatrists— 
neuroses 
of 
health? 
of 
the 
youth 
and 
youthfulness 
of 
a 
people? 
Where 
does 
that 
synthesis 
of 
god 
and 
billy 
goat 
in 
the 
satyr 
point? 
What 
experience 
of 
himself, 
what 
urge 
compelled 
the 
Greek 
to 
conceive 
the 
Dionysian 
enthusiast 
and 
primeval 
man 
as 
a 
satyr? 
And 
regarding 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
tragic 
chorus: 
did 
those 
centuries 
when 
the 
Greek 
body 
flourished 
and 
the 
Greek 
soul 
foamed 
over 
with 
health 
perhaps 
know 
endemic 
ecstasies? 
Visions 
and 
hallucinations 
shared 
by 
entire 
communities 
or 
assemblies 
at 
a 
cult? 
How 
now? 
Should 
the 
Greeks, 
precisely 
in 
the 
abundance 
of 
their 
youth, 
have 
had 
the 
will 
to 
the 
tragic 
and 
have 
been 
pessimists? 
Should 
it 
have 
been 
madness, 
to 
use 
one 
of 
Plato’s 
phrases, 
that 
brought 
the 
greatest 
blessings 
upon 
Greece? 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
conversely, 
could 
it 
be 
that 
the 
Greeks 
became 
more 
and 
more 
optimistic, 
superficial, 
and 
histrionic 
precisely 
in 
the 
period 
of 
dissolution 
and 
weakness—more 
and 
more 
ardent 
for 
logic 
and 
logicizing 



the 
world 
and 
thus 
more 
“cheerful” 
and 
“scientific”? 
How 
now? 
Could 
it 
be 
possible 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
“modern 
ideas” 
and 
the 
prejudices 
of 
a 
democratic 
taste, 
the 
triumph 
of 
optimism, 
the 
gradual 
prevalence 
of 
rationality, 
practical 
and 
theoretical 
utilitarianism, 
no 
less 
than 
democracy 
itself 
which 
developed 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
might 
all 
have 
been 
symptoms 
of 
a 
decline 
of 
strength, 
of 
impending 
old 
age, 
and 
of 
physiological 
weariness? 
These, 
and 
not 
pessimism? 
Was 
Epicurus 
an 
optimist—precisely 
because 
he 
was 
afflicted? 


It 
is 
apparent 
that 
it 
was 
a 
whole 
cluster 
of 
grave 
questions 
with 
which 
this 
book 
burdened 
itself. 
Let 
us 
add 
the 
gravest 
question 
of 
all. 
What, 
seen 
in 
the 
perspective 
of 
life, 
is 
the 
significance 
of 
morality? 



5 


Already 
in 
the 
preface 
addressed 
to 
Richard 
Wagner, 
art, 
and 
not 
morality, 
is 
presented 
as 
the 
truly 
metaphysical 
activity 
of 
man. 
In 
the 
book 
itself 
the 
suggestive 
sentence 
is 
repeated 
several 
times, 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
world 
is 
justified 
only 
as 
an 
aesthetic 
phenomenon. 
Indeed, 
the 
whole 
book 
knows 
only 
an 
artistic 
meaning 
and 
crypto-meaning 
behind 
all 
events—a 
“god,” 
if 
you 
please, 
but 
certainly 
only 
an 
entirely 
reckless 
and 
amoral 
artist-god 
who 
wants 
to 
experience, 
whether 
he 
is 
building 
or 
destroying, 
in 
the 
good 
and 
in 
the 
bad, 
his 
own 
joy 
and 
glory—one 
who, 
creating 
worlds, 
frees 
himself 
from 
the 
distress 
of 
fullness 
and 
overfullness 
and 
from 
the 
affliction 
of 
the 
contradictions 
compressed 
in 
his 
soul.6 
The 
world—at 
every 
moment 
the 
attained 
salvation 
of 
God, 
as 
the 
eternally 
changing, 
eternally 
new 
vision 
of 
the 
most 
deeply 
afflicted, 
discordant, 
and 
contradictory 
being 
who 
can 
find 
salvation 
only 
in 
appearance: 
you 
can 
call 
this 
whole 
artists’ 
metaphysics 
arbitrary, 
idle, 
fantastic; 
what 
matters 
is 
that 
it 
betrays 
a 
spirit 
who 
will 
one 
day 
fight 
at 
any 
risk 
whatever 
the 
moral 
interpretation 
and 
significance 
of 
existence. 
Here, 
perhaps 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
a 
pessimism 
“beyond 
good 
and 
evil”7 
is 
suggested. 
Here 
that 
“perversity 
of 
mind” 
gains 
speech 
and 
formulation 
against 
which 
Schopenhauer 
never 
wearied 
of 
hurling 
in 
advance 
his 
most 
irate 
curses 
and 
thunderbolts: 
a 
philosophy 
that 
dares 
to 
move, 
to 
demote, 
morality 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
appearance—and 
not 
merely 
among 
“appearances” 
or 
phenomena 
(in 
the 
sense 
assigned 
to 
these 
words 
by 
Idealistic 
philosophers), 
but 
among 
“deceptions,” 
as 
semblance, 
delusion, 
error, 
interpretation, 
contrivance, 
art. 


Perhaps 
the 
depth 
of 
this 
antimoral 
propensity 
is 
best 
inferred 
from 
the 
careful 
and 
hostile 
silence 
with 
which 
Christianity 
is 
treated 
throughout 
the 
whole 
book—Christianity 
as 
the 
most 
prodigal 
elaboration 
of 
the 
moral 
theme 
to 
which 
humanity 
has 
ever 
been 
subjected. 
In 
truth, 
nothing 
could 
be 
more 
opposed 
to 
the 
purely 
aesthetic 
interpretation 
and 
justification 
of 
the 
world 
which 
are 
taught 
in 
this 
book 
than 
the 
Christian 
teaching, 
which 
is, 
and 
wants 
to 
be, 
only 
moral 
and 
which 
relegates 
art, 
every 
art, 
to 
the 
realm 
of 
lies; 
with 
its 
absolute 
standards, 
beginning 
with 
the 
truthfulness 
of 
God, 
it 
negates, 



judges, 
and 
damns 
art. 
Behind 
this 
mode 
of 
thought 
and 
valuation, 
which 
must 
be 
hostile 
to 
art 
if 
it 
is 
at 
all 
genuine, 
I 
never 
failed 
to 
sense 
a 
hostility 
to 
life—a 
furious, 
vengeful 
antipathy 
to 
life 
itself: 
for 
all 
of 
life 
is 
based 
on 
semblance, 
art, 
deception, 
points 
of 
view, 
and 
the 
necessity 
of 
perspectives 
and 
error. 
Christianity 
was 
from 
the 
beginning, 
essentially 
and 
fundamentally, 
life’s 
nausea 
and 
disgust 
with 
life, 
merely 
concealed 
behind, 
masked 
by, 
dressed 
up 
as, 
faith 
in 
“another” 
or 
“better” 
life. 
Hatred 
of 
“the 
world,” 
condemnations 
of 
the 
passions, 
fear 
of 
beauty 
and 
sensuality, 
a 
beyond 
invented 
the 
better 
to 
slander 
this 
life, 
at 
bottom 
a 
craving 
for 
the 
nothing, 
for 
the 
end, 
for 
respite, 
for 
“the 
sabbath 
of 
sabbaths”—all 
this 
always 
struck 
me, 
no 
less 
than 
the 
unconditional 
will 
of 
Christianity 
to 
recognize 
only 
moral 
values, 
as 
the 
most 
dangerous 
and 
uncanny 
form 
of 
all 
possible 
forms 
of 
a 
“will 
to 
decline”8 
—at 
the 
very 
least 
a 
sign 
of 
abysmal 
sickness, 
weariness, 
discouragement, 
exhaustion, 
and 
the 
impoverishment 
of 
life. 
For, 
confronted 
with 
morality 
(especially 
Christian, 
or 
unconditional, 
morality), 
life 
must 
continually 
and 
inevitably 
be 
in 
the 
wrong, 
because 
life 
is 
something 
essentially 
amoral—and 
eventually, 
crushed 
by 
the 
weight 
of 
contempt 
and 
the 
eternal 
No, 
life 
must 
then 
be 
felt 
to 
be 
unworthy 
of 
desire 
and 
altogether 
worthless. 
Morality 
itself—how 
now? 
might 
not 
morality 
be 
“a 
will 
to 
negate 
life,” 
a 
secret 
instinct 
of 
annihilation, 
a 
principle 
of 
decay, 
diminution, 
and 
slander—the 
beginning 
of 
the 
end? 
Hence, 
the 
danger 
of 
dangers? 


It 
was 
against 
morality 
that 
my 
instinct 
turned 
with 
this 
questionable 
book, 
long 
ago; 
it 
was 
an 
instinct 
that 
aligned 
itself 
with 
life 
and 
that 
discovered 
for 
itself 
a 
fundamentally 
opposite 
doctrine 
and 
valuation 
of 
life—purely 
artistic 
and 
anti-Christian. 
What 
to 
call 
it? 
As 
a 
philologist 
and 
man 
of 
words 
I 
baptized 
it, 
not 
without 
taking 
some 
liberty—for 
who 
could 
claim 
to 
know 
the 
rightful 
name 
of 
the 
Antichrist?—in 
the 
name 
of 
a 
Greek 
god: 
I 
called 
it 
Dionysian. 



6 


It 
is 
clear 
what 
task 
I 
first 
dared 
to 
touch 
with 
this 
book? 
How 
I 
regret 
now 
that 
in 
those 
days 
I 
still 
lacked 
the 
courage 
(or 
immodesty?) 
to 
permit 
myself 
in 
every 
way 
an 
individual 
language 
of 
my 
own 
for 
such 
individual 
views 
and 
hazards—and 
that 
instead 
I 
tried 
laboriously 
to 
express 
by 
means 
of 
Schopenhauerian 
and 
Kantian 
formulas 
strange 
and 
new 
valuations 
which 
were 
basically 
at 
odds 
with 
Kant’s 
and 
Schopenhauer’s 
spirit 
and 
taste! 
What, 
after 
all, 
did 
Schopenhauer 
think 
of 
tragedy? 


“That 
which 
bestows 
on 
everything 
tragic 
its 
peculiar 
elevating 
force”—he 
says 
in 
The 
World 
as 
Will 
and 
Representation,9 
volume 
II, 
p. 
495—“is 
the 
discovery 
that 
the 
world, 
that 
life, 
can 
never 
give 
real 
satisfaction 
and 
hence 
is 
not 
worthy 
of 
our 
affection: 
this 
constitutes 
the 
tragic 
spirit—it 
leads 
to 
resignation.” 


How 
differently 
Dionysus 
spoke 
to 
me! 
How 
far 
removed 
I 
was 
from 
all 
this 
resignationism!—10 
But 
there 
is 
something 
far 
worse 
in 
this 
book, 
something 
I 
now 
regret 
still 
more 
than 
that 
I 
obscured 
and 
spoiled 
Dionysian 
premonitions 
with 
Schopenhauerian 
formulations: 
namely, 
that 
I 
spoiled 
the 
grandiose 
Greek 
problem, 
as 
it 
had 
arisen 
before 
my 
eyes, 
by 
introducing 
the 
most 
modern 
problems! 
That 
I 
appended 
hopes 
where 
there 
was 
no 
ground 
for 
hope, 
where 
everything 
pointed 
all 
too 
plainly 
to 
an 
end! 
That 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
latest 
German 
music 
I 
began 
to 
rave 
about 
“the 
German 
spirit” 
as 
if 
that 
were 
in 
the 
process 
even 
then 
of 
discovering 
and 
finding 
itself 
again—at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
German 
spirit, 
which 
not 
long 
before 
had 
still 
had 
the 
will 
to 
dominate 
Europe 
and 
the 
strength 
to 
lead 
Europe,11 
was 
just 
making 
its 
testament 
and 
abdicating 
forever, 
making 
its 
transition, 
under 
the 
pompous 
pretense 
of 
founding 
a 
Reich, 
to 
a 
leveling 
mediocrity, 
democracy, 
and 
“modern 
ideas”! 


Indeed, 
meanwhile 
I 
have 
learned 
to 
consider 
this 
“German 
spirit” 
with 
a 
sufficient 
lack 
of 
hope 
or 
mercy; 
also, 
contemporary 
German 
music, 
which 
is 
romanticism 
through 
and 
through 
and 
most 
un-Greek 
of 
all 
possible 
art 
forms 
—moreover, 
a 
first-rate 
poison 
for 
the 
nerves, 
doubly 
dangerous 
among 
a 
people 
who 
love 
drink 
and 
who 
honor 
lack 
of 
clarity 
as 
a 
virtue, 
for 
it 
has 
the 



double 
quality 
of 
a 
narcotic 
that 
both 
intoxicates 
and 
spreads 
a 
fog. 


To 
be 
sure, 
apart 
from 
all 
the 
hasty 
hopes 
and 
faulty 
applications 
to 
the 
present 
with 
which 
I 
spoiled 
my 
first 
book, 
there 
still 
remains 
the 
great 
Dionysian 
question 
mark 
I 
raised—regarding 
music 
as 
well: 
what 
would 
a 
music 
have 
to 
be 
like 
that 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
of 
romantic 
origin, 
like 
German 
music—but 
Dionysian? 



7 


But, 
my 
dear 
sir, 
what 
in 
the 
world 
is 
romantic 
if 
your 
book 
isn’t? 
Can 
deep 
hatred 
against 
“the 
Now,” 
against 
“reality” 
and 
“modern 
ideas” 
be 
pushed 
further 
than 
you 
pushed 
it 
in 
your 
artists’ 
metaphysics? 
believing 
sooner 
in 
the 
Nothing, 
sooner 
in 
the 
devil 
than 
in 
“the 
Now”? 
Is 
it 
not 
a 
deep 
bass 
of 
wrath 
and 
the 
lust 
for 
destruction 
that 
we 
hear 
humming 
underneath 
all 
of 
your 
contrapuntal 
vocal 
art 
and 
seduction 
of 
the 
ear, 
a 
furious 
resolve 
against 
everything 
that 
is 
“now,” 
a 
will 
that 
is 
not 
too 
far 
removed 
from 
practical 
nihilism 
and 
seems 
to 
say: 
“sooner 
let 
nothing 
be 
true 
than 
that 
you 
should 
be 
right, 
than 
that 
your 
truth 
should 
be 
proved 
right!” 


Listen 
yourself, 
my 
dear 
pessimist 
and 
art-deifier, 
but 
with 
open 
ears, 
to 
a 
single 
passage 
chosen 
from 
your 
book—to 
the 
not 
ineloquent 
dragon-slayer 
passage 
which 
may 
have 
an 
insidious 
pied-piper 
sound 
for 
young 
ears 
and 
hearts. 
How 
now? 
Isn’t 
this 
the 
typical 
creed 
of 
the 
romantic 
of 
1830, 
masked 
by 
the 
pessimism 
of 
1850? 
Even 
the 
usual 
romantic 
finale 
is 
sounded—break, 
breakdown, 
return 
and 
collapse 
before 
an 
old 
faith, 
before 
the 
old 
God. 
How 
now? 
Is 
your 
pessimists’ 
book 
not 
itself 
a 
piece 
of 
anti-Hellenism 
and 
romanticism? 
Is 
it 
not 
itself 
something 
“equally 
intoxicating 
and 
befogging,” 
in 
any 
case 
a 
narcotic, 
even 
a 
piece 
of 
music, 
German 
music? 
But 
listen: 


“Let 
us 
imagine 
a 
coming 
generation 
with 
such 
intrepidity 
of 
vision, 
with 
such 
a 
heroic 
penchant 
for 
the 
tremendous; 
let 
us 
imagine 
the 
bold 
stride 
of 
these 
dragon-slayers, 
the 
proud 
audacity 
with 
which 
they 
turn 
their 
back 
on 
all 
the 
weakling’s 
doctrines 
of 
optimism 
in 
order 
to 
live 
resolutely’ 
in 
wholeness 
and 
fullness: 
would 
it 
not 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
tragic 
man 
of 
such 
a 
culture, 
in 
view 
of 
his 
self-education 
for 
seriousness 
and 
terror, 
to 
desire 
a 
new 
art, 
the 
art 
of 
metaphysical 
comfort, 
to 
desire 
tragedy 
as 
his 
own 
proper 
Helen, 
and 
to 
exclaim 
with 
Faust: 


Should 
not 
my 
longing 
overleap 
the 
distance 
And 
draw 
the 
fairest 
form 
into 
existence?”12 


“Would 
it 
not 
be 
necessary?”—No, 
thrice 
no! 
O 
you 
young 
romantics: 
it 
would 
not 
be 
necessary! 
But 
it 
is 
highly 
probable 
that 
it 
will 
end 
that 
way, 



that 
you 
end 
that 
way—namely, 
“comforted,” 
as 
it 
is 
written, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
self-education 
for 
seriousness 
and 
terror, 
“comforted 
metaphysically”—in 
sum, 
as 
romantics 
end, 
as 
Christians. 


No! 
You 
ought 
to 
learn 
the 
art 
of 
this-worldly 
comfort 
first; 
you 
ought 
to 
learn 
to 
laugh, 
my 
young 
friends, 
if 
you 
are 
hell-bent 
on 
remaining 
pessimists. 
Then 
perhaps, 
as 
laughers, 
you 
may 
some 
day 
dispatch 
all 
metaphysical 
comforts 
to 
the 
devil—metaphysics 
in 
front. 
Or, 
to 
say 
it 
in 
the 
language 
of 
that 
Dionysian 
monster 
who 
bears 
the 
name 
of 
Zarathustra: 


“Raise 
up 
your 
hearts, 
my 
brothers, 
high, 
higher! 
And 
don’t 
forget 
your 
legs! 
Raise 
up 
your 
legs, 
too, 
good 
dancers; 
and 
still 
better: 
stand 
on 
your 
heads! 


“This 
crown 
of 
the 
laugher, 
the 
rose-wreath 
crown: 
I 
crown 
myself 
with 
this 
crown; 
I 
myself 
pronounced 
holy 
my 
laughter. 
I 
did 
not 
find 
anyone 
else 
today 
strong 
enough 
for 
that. 


“Zarathustra, 
the 
dancer; 
Zarathustra, 
the 
light 
one 
who 
beckons 
with 
his 
wings, 
preparing 
for 
a 
flight, 
beckoning 
to 
all 
birds, 
ready 
and 
heady, 
blissfully 
lightheaded; 


“Zarathustra, 
the 
soothsayer; 
Zarathustra, 
the 
sooth-laugher; 
not 
impatient; 
not 
unconditional; 
one 
who 
loves 
leaps 
and 
side-leaps: 
I 
crown 
myself 
with 
this 
crown. 


“This 
crown 
of 
the 
laugher, 
the 
rose-wreath 
crown: 
to 
you, 
my 
brothers, 
I 
throw 
this 
crown. 
Laughter 
I 
have 
pronounced 
holy: 
you 
higher 
men, 
learn— 
to 
laugh!” 


Thus 
Spoke

year 
that 
saw 
the 
publication 
of 
Beyond

the

When 
Nietzsche 
died 
in 
1900, 
Stefan 
George, 
the 
most 
remarkable 
German 
poet 
of 
his 
generation, 
after 
Rilke, 
wrote 
a 
poem 
on 
“Nietzsche” 
that 
ends: 
“it 
should 
have 
sung, 
not 
spoken, 
this 
new 
soul.” 
For 
George’s 
whole 
poem,

German 
Poets:

Collection

Modern 
Library,

The 
conception 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
in 
The 
Birth 
differs 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
later 
conception 
of 
the 
Dionysian. 
He 
originally 
introduced 
the 
term 
to 
symbolize 
the 
tendencies 
that 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
festivals 
of 
Dionysus, 
and 
contrasted 
the 
Dionysian 
with 
the 
Apollinian; 
but 
in 
his 
later 
thought 
the 
Dionysian 
stands 
for 
the 
creative 
employment 
of 
the 
passions 
and 
the 
affirmation 
of 
life 
in 
spite 
of 
suffering—as 
it 
were, 
for 
the 
synthesis 
of 
the 
Dionysian, 
as 
originally 
conceived, 
with 
the 
Apollinian—and 
it 
is 
contrasted 
with 
the 
Christian 
negation 
of 
life 
and 
extirpation 
of 
the 
passions. 
In 
the 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols, 
written 
in 
1888, 
the 
outlook 
of 
the 
old 
Goethe 
can 
thus 
be 
called 
Dionysian 
(section 
49).

Cf. 
the 
words 
which 
Heine, 
in 
his 
Schöpfungslieder, 
attributes 
to 
God: 
“Disease 
was 
the 
most 
basic 
ground/of 
my 
creative 
urge 
and 
stress;/creating, 
I 
could 
convalesce,/creating, 
I 
again 
grew 
sound.”

published 
in 
1886,

Preface 
to 
Richard

To 
keep 
at 
a 
distance 
all 
the 
possible 
scruples, 
excitements, 
and 
misunderstandings 
that 
the 
thoughts 
united 
in 
this 
essay 
will 
occasion, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
peculiar 
character 
of 
our 
aesthetic 
public, 
and 
to 
be 
able 
to 
write 
these 
introductory 
remarks, 
too, 
with 
the 
same 
contemplative 
delight 
whose 
reflection—the 
distillation 
of 
good 
and 
elevating 
hours—is 
evident 
on 
every 
page, 
I 
picture 
the 
moment 
when 
you, 
my 
highly 
respected 
friend, 
will 
receive 
this 
essay. 
Perhaps 
after 
an 
evening 
walk 
in 
the 
winter 
snow, 
you 
will 
behold 
Prometheus 
unbound 
on 
the 
title 
page, 
read 
my 
name, 
and 
be 
convinced 
at 
once 
that, 
whatever 
this 
essay 
should 
contain, 
the 
author 
certainly 
has 
something 
serious 
and 
urgent 
to 
say; 
also 
that, 
as 
he 
hatched 
these 
ideas, 
he 
was 
communicating 
with 
you 
as 
if 
you 
were 
present, 
and 
hence 
could 
write 
down 
only 
what 
was 
in 
keeping 
with 
that 
presence. 
You 
will 
recall 
that 
it 
was 
during 
the 
same 
period 
when 
your 
splendid 
Festschrift 
on 
Beethoven 
came 
into 
being, 
amid 
the 
terrors 
and 
sublimities 
of 
the 
war 
that 
had 
just 
broken 
out, 
that 
I 
collected 
myself 
for 
these 
reflections. 
Yet 
anyone 
would 
be 
mistaken 
if 
he 
associated 
my 
reflections 
with 
the 
contrast 
between 
patriotic 
excitement 
and 
aesthetic 
enthusiasm, 
of 
courageous 
seriousness 
and 
a 
cheerful 
game: 
if 
he 
really 
read 
this 
essay, 
it 
would 
dawn 
on 
him, 
to 
his 
surprise, 
what 
a 
seriously 
German 
problem 
is 
faced 
here 
and 
placed 
right 
in 
the 
center 
of 
German 
hopes, 
as 
a 
vortex 
and 
turning 
point.1 
But 
perhaps 
such 
readers 
will 
find 
it 
offensive 
that 
an 
aesthetic 
problem 
should 
be 
taken 
so 
seriously—assuming 
they 
are 
unable 
to 
consider 
art 
more 
than 
a 
pleasant 
sideline, 
a 
readily 
dispensable 
tinkling 
of 
bells 
that 
accompanies 
the 
“seriousness 
of 
life,” 
just 
as 
if 
nobody 
knew 
what 
was 
involved 
in 
such 
a 
contrast 
with 
the 
“seriousness 
of 
life.” 
Let 
such 
“serious” 
readers 
learn 
something 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
am 
convinced 
that 
art 
represents 
the 
highest 
task 
and 
the 
truly 
metaphysical 
activity 
of 
this 
life, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
that 
man 
to 
whom, 
as 
my 
sublime 
predecessor 
on 
this 
path, 
I 
wish 
to 
dedicate 
this 
essay.

We 
shall 
have 
gained 
much 
for 
the 
science 
of 
aesthetics, 
once 
we 
perceive 
not 
merely 
by 
logical 
inference, 
but 
with 
the 
immediate 
certainty 
of 
vision, 
that 
the 
continuous 
development 
of 
art 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
Dionysian 
duality—just 
as 
procreation 
depends 
on 
the 
duality 
of 
the 
sexes, 
involving 
perpetual 
strife 
with 
only 
periodically 
intervening 
reconciliations. 
The 
terms 
Dionysian 
and 
Apollinian 
we 
borrow 
from 
the 
Greeks, 
who 
disclose 
to 
the 
discerning 
mind 
the 
profound 
mysteries 
of 
their 
view 
of 
art, 
not, 
to 
be 
sure, 
in 
concepts, 
but 
in 
the 
intensely 
clear 
figures 
of 
their 
gods. 
Through 
Apollo 
and 
Dionysus, 
the 
two 
art 
deities 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
we 
come 
to 
recognize 
that 
in 
the 
Greek 
world 
there 
existed 
a 
tremendous 
opposition, 
in 
origin 
and 
aims,1 
between 
the 
Apollinian 
art 
of 
sculpture, 
and 
the 
nonimagistic, 
Dionysian 
art 
of 
music. 
These 
two 
different 
tendencies 
run 
parallel 
to 
each 
other, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
openly 
at 
variance; 
and 
they 
continually 
incite 
each 
other 
to 
new 
and 
more 
powerful 
births, 
which 
perpetuate 
an 
antagonism, 
only 
superficially 
reconciled 
by 
the 
common 
term 
“art”; 
till 
eventually,2 
by 
a 
metaphysical 
miracle 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
“will,” 
they 
appear 
coupled 
with 
each 
other, 
and 
through 
this 
coupling 
ultimately 
generate 
an 
equally 
Dionysian 
and 
Apollinian 
form 
of 
art—Attic 
tragedy. 


In 
order 
to 
grasp 
these 
two 
tendencies, 
let 
us 
first 
conceive 
of 
them 
as 
the 
separate 
art 
worlds 
of 
dreams 
and 
intoxication. 
These 
physiological 
phenomena 
present 
a 
contrast 
analogous 
to 
that 
existing 
between 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian. 
It 
was 
in 
dreams, 
says 
Lucretius, 
that 
the 
glorious 
divine 
figures 
first 
appeared 
to 
the 
souls 
of 
men; 
in 
dreams 
the 
great 
shaper 
beheld 
the 
splendid 
bodies 
of 
superhuman 
beings; 
and 
the 
Hellenic 
poet, 
if 
questioned 
about 
the 
mysteries 
of 
poetic 
inspiration, 
would 
likewise 
have 
suggested 
dreams 
and 
he 
might 
have 
given 
an 
explanation 
like 
that 
of 
Hans 
Sachs 
in 
the 
Meistersinger: 


The 
poet’s 
task 
is 
this, 
my 
friend, 
to 
read 
his 
dreams 
and 
comprehend. 
The 
truest 
human 
fancy 
seems 



to 
be 
revealed 
to 
us 
in 
dreams: 


all 
poems 
and 
versification 


are 
but 
true 
dreams’ 
interpretation.3 


The 
beautiful 
illusion4 
of 
the 
dream 
worlds, 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
which 
every 
man 
is 
truly 
an 
artist, 
is 
the 
prerequisite 
of 
all 
plastic 
art, 
and, 
as 
we 
shall 
see, 
of 
an 
important 
part 
of 
poetry 
also. 
In 
our 
dreams 
we 
delight 
in 
the 
immediate 
understanding 
of 
figures; 
all 
forms 
speak 
to 
us; 
there 
is 
nothing 
unimportant 
or 
superfluous. 
But 
even 
when 
this 
dream 
reality 
is 
most 
intense, 
we 
still 
have, 
glimmering 
through 
it, 
the 
sensation 
that 
it 
is 
mere 
appearance: 
at 
least 
this 
is 
my 
experience, 
and 
for 
its 
frequency—indeed, 
normality—I 
could 
adduce 
many 
proofs, 
including 
the 
sayings 
of 
the 
poets. 


Philosophical 
men 
even 
have 
a 
presentiment 
that 
the 
reality 
in 
which 
we 
live 
and 
have 
our 
being 
is 
also 
mere 
appearance, 
and 
that 
another, 
quite 
different 
reality 
lies 
beneath 
it. 
Schopenhauer 
actually 
indicates 
as 
the 
criterion 
of 
philosophical 
ability 
the 
occasional 
ability 
to 
view 
men 
and 
things 
as 
mere 
phantoms 
or 
dream 
images. 
Thus 
the 
aesthetically 
sensitive 
man 
stands 
in 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
the 
reality 
of 
dreams 
as 
the 
philosopher 
does 
to 
the 
reality 
of 
existence; 
he 
is 
a 
close 
and 
willing 
observer, 
for 
these 
images 
afford 
him 
an 
interpretation 
of 
life, 
and 
by 
reflecting 
on 
these 
processes 
he 
trains 
himself 
for 
life. 


It 
is 
not 
only 
the 
agreeable 
and 
friendly 
images 
that 
he 
experiences 
as 
something 
universally 
intelligible: 
the 
serious, 
the 
troubled, 
the 
sad, 
the 
gloomy, 
the 
sudden 
restraints, 
the 
tricks 
of 
accident, 
anxious 
expectations, 
in 
short, 
the 
whole 
divine 
comedy 
of 
life, 
including 
the 
inferno, 
also 
pass 
before 
him, 
not 
like 
mere 
shadows 
on 
a 
wall—for 
he 
lives 
and 
suffers 
with 
these 
scenes—and 
yet 
not 
without 
that 
fleeting 
sensation 
of 
illusion. 
And 
perhaps 
many 
will, 
like 
myself, 
recall 
how 
amid 
the 
dangers 
and 
terrors 
of 
dreams 
they 
have 
occasionally 
said 
to 
themselves 
in 
self-encouragement, 
and 
not 
without 
success: 
“It 
is 
a 
dream! 
I 
will 
dream 
on!” 
I 
have 
likewise 
heard 
of 
people 
who 
were 
able 
to 
continue 
one 
and 
the 
same 
dream 
for 
three 
and 
even 
more 
successive 
nights—facts 
which 
indicate 
clearly 
how 
our 
innermost 
being, 
our 
common 
ground, 
experiences 
dreams 
with 
profound 
delight 
and 
a 
joyous 
necessity. 


This 
joyous 
necessity 
of 
the 
dream 
experience 
has 
been 
embodied 
by 
the 
Greeks 
in 
their 
Apollo: 
Apollo, 
the 
god 
of 
all 
plastic 
energies, 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
soothsaying 
god. 
He, 
who 
(as 
the 
etymology 
of 
the 
name 
indicates) 



is 
the 
“shining 
one,”5 
the 
deity 
of 
light, 
is 
also 
ruler 
over 
the 
beautiful 
illusion 
of 
the 
inner 
world 
of 
fantasy. 
The 
higher 
truth, 
the 
perfection 
of 
these 
states 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
incompletely 
intelligible 
everyday 
world, 
this 
deep 
consciousness 
of 
nature, 
healing 
and 
helping 
in 
sleep 
and 
dreams, 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
symbolical 
analogue 
of 
the 
soothsaying 
faculty 
and 
of 
the 
arts 
generally, 
which 
make 
life 
possible 
and 
worth 
living. 
But 
we 
must 
also 
include 
in 
our 
image 
of 
Apollo 
that 
delicate 
boundary 
which 
the 
dream 
image 
must 
not 
overstep 
lest 
it 
have 
a 
pathological 
effect 
(in 
which 
case 
mere 
appearance 
would 
deceive 
us 
as 
if 
it 
were 
crude 
reality). 
We 
must 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
measured 
restraint, 
that 
freedom 
from 
the 
wilder 
emotions, 
that 
calm 
of 
the 
sculptor 
god. 
His 
eye 
must 
be 
“sunlike,” 
as 
befits 
his 
origin; 
even 
when 
it 
is 
angry 
and 
distempered 
it 
is 
still 
hallowed 
by 
beautiful 
illusion. 
And 
so, 
in 
one 
sense, 
we 
might 
apply 
to 
Apollo 
the 
words 
of 
Schopenhauer 
when 
he 
speaks 
of 
the 
man 
wrapped 
in 
the 
veil 
of 
māyā6 
(Welt 
als 
Wille 
und 
Vorstellung, 
I, 
p. 
4167): 
“Just 
as 
in 
a 
stormy 
sea 
that, 
unbounded 
in 
all 
directions, 
raises 
and 
drops 
mountainous 
waves, 
howling, 
a 
sailor 
sits 
in 
a 
boat 
and 
trusts 
in 
his 
frail 
bark: 
so 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
world 
of 
torments 
the 
individual 
human 
being 
sits 
quietly, 
supported 
by 
and 
trusting 
in 
the 
principium 
individuationis.”8 


In 
fact, 
we 
might 
say 
of 
Apollo 
that 
in 
him 
the 
unshaken 
faith 
in 
this 
principium 
and 
the 
calm 
repose 
of 
the 
man 
wrapped 
up 
in 
it 
receive 
their 
most 
sublime 
expression; 
and 
we 
might 
call 
Apollo 
himself 
the 
glorious 
divine 
image 
of 
the 
principium 
individuationis, 
through 
whose 
gestures 
and 
eyes 
all 
the 
joy 
and 
wisdom 
of 
“illusion,” 
together 
with 
its 
beauty, 
speak 
to 
us. 


In 
the 
same 
work 
Schopenhauer 
has 
depicted 
for 
us 
the 
tremendous 
terror 
which 
seizes 
man 
when 
he 
is 
suddenly 
dumfounded 
by 
the 
cognitive 
form 
of 
phenomena 
because 
the 
principle 
of 
sufficient 
reason, 
in 
some 
one 
of 
its 
manifestations, 
seems 
to 
suffer 
an 
exception. 
If 
we 
add 
to 
this 
terror 
the 
blissful 
ecstasy 
that 
wells 
from 
the 
innermost 
depths 
of 
man, 
indeed 
of 
nature, 
at 
this 
collapse 
of 
the 
principium 
individuationis, 
we 
steal 
a 
glimpse 
into 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
Dionysian, 
which 
is 
brought 
home 
to 
us 
most 
intimately 
by 
the 
analogy 
of 
intoxication. 


Either 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
narcotic 
draught, 
of 
which 
the 
songs 
of 
all 
primitive 
men 
and 
peoples 
speak, 
or 
with 
the 
potent 
coming 
of 
spring 
that 
penetrates 
all 
nature 
with 
joy, 
these 
Dionysian 
emotions 
awake, 
and 
as 
they 
grow 
in 
intensity 
everything 
subjective 
vanishes 
into 
complete 
self



forgetfulness. 
In 
the 
German 
Middle 
Ages, 
too, 
singing 
and 
dancing 
crowds, 
ever 
increasing 
in 
number, 
whirled 
themselves 
from 
place 
to 
place 
under 
this 
same 
Dionysian 
impulse. 
In 
these 
dancers 
of 
St. 
John 
and 
St. 
Vitus, 
we 
rediscover 
the 
Bacchic 
choruses 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
with 
their 
prehistory 
in 
Asia 
Minor, 
as 
far 
back 
as 
Babylon 
and 
the 
orgiastic 
Sacaea.9 
There 
are 
some 
who, 
from 
obtuseness 
or 
lack 
of 
experience, 
turn 
away 
from 
such 
phenomena 
as 
from 
“folk-diseases,” 
with 
contempt 
or 
pity 
born 
of 
the 
consciousness 
of 
their 
own 
“healthy-mindedness.” 
But 
of 
course 
such 
poor 
wretches 
have 
no 
idea 
how 
corpselike 
and 
ghostly 
their 
so-called 
“healthy-mindedness” 
looks 
when 
the 
glowing 
life 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
revelers 
roars 
past 
them. 


Under 
the 
charm 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
not 
only 
is 
the 
union 
between 
man 
and 
man 
reaffirmed, 
but 
nature 
which 
has 
become 
alienated, 
hostile, 
or 
subjugated, 
celebrates 
once 
more 
her 
reconciliation 
with 
her 
lost 
son,10 
man. 
Freely, 
earth 
proffers 
her 
gifts, 
and 
peacefully 
the 
beasts 
of 
prey 
of 
the 
rocks 
and 
desert 
approach. 
The 
chariot 
of 
Dionysus 
is 
covered 
with 
flowers 
and 
garlands; 
panthers 
and 
tigers 
walk 
under 
its 
yoke. 
Transform 
Beethoven’s 
“Hymn 
to 
Joy” 
into 
a 
painting; 
let 
your 
imagination 
conceive 
the 
multitudes 
bowing 
to 
the 
dust, 
awestruck—then 
you 
will 
approach 
the 
Dionysian. 
Now 
the 
slave 
is 
a 
free 
man; 
now 
all 
the 
rigid, 
hostile 
barriers 
that 
necessity, 
caprice, 
or 
“impudent 
convention”11 
have 
fixed 
between 
man 
and 
man 
are 
broken. 
Now, 
with 
the 
gospel 
of 
universal 
harmony, 
each 
one 
feels 
himself 
not 
only 
united, 
reconciled, 
and 
fused 
with 
his 
neighbor, 
but 
as 
one 
with 
him, 
as 
if 
the 
veil 
of 
māyā 
had 
been 
torn 
aside 
and 
were 
now 
merely 
fluttering 
in 
tatters 
before 
the 
mysterious 
primordial 
unity. 


In 
song 
and 
in 
dance 
man 
expresses 
himself 
as 
a 
member 
of 
a 
higher 
community; 
he 
has 
forgotten 
how 
to 
walk 
and 
speak 
and 
is 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
flying 
into 
the 
air, 
dancing. 
His 
very 
gestures 
express 
enchantment. 
Just 
as 
the 
animals 
now 
talk, 
and 
the 
earth 
yields 
milk 
and 
honey, 
supernatural 
sounds 
emanate 
from 
him, 
too: 
he 
feels 
himself 
a 
god, 
he 
himself 
now 
walks 
about 
enchanted, 
in 
ecstasy, 
like 
the 
gods 
he 
saw 
walking 
in 
his 
dreams. 
He 
is 
no 
longer 
an 
artist, 
he 
has 
become 
a 
work 
of 
art: 
in 
these 
paroxysms 
of 
intoxication 
the 
artistic 
power 
of 
all 
nature 
reveals 
itself 
to 
the 
highest 
gratification 
of 
the 
primordial 
unity. 
The 
noblest 
clay, 
the 
most 
costly 
marble, 
man, 
is 
here 
kneaded 
and 
cut, 
and 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
chisel 
strokes 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
world-artist 
rings 
out 
the 
cry 
of 
the 
Eleusinian 
mysteries: 
“Do 
you 
prostrate 
yourselves, 
millions? 
Do 
you 
sense 
your 
Maker, 
world?”12 



2 


Thus 
far 
we 
have 
considered 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
its 
opposite, 
the 
Dionysian, 
as 
artistic 
energies 
which 
burst 
forth 
from 
nature 
herself, 
without 
the 
mediation 
of 
the 
human 
artist—energies 
in 
which 
nature’s 
art 
impulses 
are 
satisfied 
in 
the 
most 
immediate 
and 
direct 
way—first 
in 
the 
image 
world 
of 
dreams, 
whose 
completeness 
is 
not 
dependent 
upon 
the 
intellectual 
attitude 
or 
the 
artistic 
culture 
of 
any 
single 
being; 
and 
then 
as 
intoxicated 
reality, 
which 
likewise 
does 
not 
heed 
the 
single 
unit, 
but 
even 
seeks 
to 
destroy 
the 
individual 
and 
redeem 
him 
by 
a 
mystic 
feeling 
of 
oneness. 
With 
reference 
to 
these 
immediate 
art-states 
of 
nature, 
every 
artist 
is 
an 
“imitator,” 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
either 
an 
Apollinian 
artist 
in 
dreams, 
or 
a 
Dionysian 
artist 
in 
ecstasies, 
or 
finally—as 
for 
example 
in 
Greek 
tragedy—at 
once 
artist 
in 
both 
dreams 
and 
ecstasies; 
so 
we 
may 
perhaps 
picture 
him 
sinking 
down 
in 
his 
Dionysian 
intoxication 
and 
mystical 
self-abnegation, 
alone 
and 
apart 
from 
the 
singing 
revelers, 
and 
we 
may 
imagine 
how, 
through 
Apollinian 
dream-inspiration, 
his 
own 
state, 
i.e., 
his 
oneness 
with 
the 
inmost 
ground 
of 
the 
world, 
is 
revealed 
to 
him 
in 
a 
symbolical 
dream 
image. 


So 
much 
for 
these 
general 
premises 
and 
contrasts. 
Let 
us 
now 
approach 
the 
Greeks 
in 
order 
to 
learn 
how 
highly 
these 
art 
impulses 
of 
nature 
were 
developed 
in 
them. 
Thus 
we 
shall 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
understand 
and 
appreciate 
more 
deeply 
that 
relation 
of 
the 
Greek 
artist 
to 
his 
archetypes 
which 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
Aristotelian 
expression, 
“the 
imitation 
of 
nature.” 
In 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
dream 
literature 
and 
the 
numerous 
dream 
anecdotes 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
we 
can 
speak 
of 
their 
dreams 
only 
conjecturally, 
though 
with 
reasonable 
assurance. 
If 
we 
consider 
the 
incredibly 
precise 
and 
unerring 
plastic 
power 
of 
their 
eyes, 
together 
with 
their 
vivid, 
frank 
delight 
in 
colors, 
we 
can 
hardly 
refrain 
from 
assuming 
even 
for 
their 
dreams 
(to 
the 
shame 
of 
all 
those 
born 
later) 
a 
certain 
logic 
of 
line 
and 
contour, 
colors 
and 
groups, 
a 
certain 
pictorial 
sequence 
reminding 
us 
of 
their 
finest 
bas-reliefs 
whose 
perfection 
would 
certainly 
justify 
us, 
if 
a 
comparison 
were 
possible, 
in 
designating 
the 
dreaming 
Greeks 
as 
Homers 
and 
Homer 
as 
a 
dreaming 
Greek 
—in 
a 
deeper 
sense 
than 
that 
in 
which 
modern 
man, 
speaking 
of 
his 
dreams, 
ventures 
to 
compare 
himself 
with 
Shakespeare. 



On 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
need 
not 
conjecture 
regarding 
the 
immense 
gap 
which 
separates 
the 
Dionysian 
Greek 
from 
the 
Dionysian 
barbarian. 
From 
all 
quarters 
of 
the 
ancient 
world—to 
say 
nothing 
here 
of 
the 
modern—from 
Rome 
to 
Babylon, 
we 
can 
point 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
Dionysian 
festivals, 
types 
which 
bear, 
at 
best, 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
the 
Greek 
festivals 
which 
the 
bearded 
satyr, 
who 
borrowed 
his 
name 
and 
attributes 
from 
the 
goat, 
bears 
to 
Dionysus 
himself. 
In 
nearly 
every 
case 
these 
festivals 
centered 
in 
extravagant 
sexual 
licentiousness, 
whose 
waves 
overwhelmed 
all 
family 
life 
and 
its 
venerable 
traditions; 
the 
most 
savage 
natural 
instincts 
were 
unleashed, 
including 
even 
that 
horrible 
mixture 
of 
sensuality 
and 
cruelty 
which 
has 
always 
seemed 
to 
me 
to 
be 
the 
real 
“witches’ 
brew.” 
For 
some 
time, 
however, 
the 
Greeks 
were 
apparently 
perfectly 
insulated 
and 
guarded 
against 
the 
feverish 
excitements 
of 
these 
festivals, 
though 
knowledge 
of 
them 
must 
have 
come 
to 
Greece 
on 
all 
the 
routes 
of 
land 
and 
sea; 
for 
the 
figure 
of 
Apollo, 
rising 
full 
of 
pride, 
held 
out 
the 
Gorgon’s 
head 
to 
this 
grotesquely 
uncouth 
Dionysian 
power—and 
really 
could 
not 
have 
countered 
any 
more 
dangerous 
force. 
It 
is 
in 
Doric 
art 
that 
this 
majestically 
rejecting 
attitude 
of 
Apollo 
is 
immortalized. 


The 
opposition 
between 
Apollo 
and 
Dionysus 
became 
more 
hazardous 
and 
even 
impossible, 
when 
similar 
impulses 
finally 
burst 
forth 
from 
the 
deepest 
roots 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
nature 
and 
made 
a 
path 
for 
themselves: 
the 
Delphic 
god, 
by 
a 
seasonably 
effected 
reconciliation, 
now 
contented 
himself 
with 
taking 
the 
destructive 
weapons 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
his 
powerful 
antagonist. 
This 
reconciliation 
is 
the 
most 
important 
moment 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Greek 
cult: 
wherever 
we 
turn 
we 
note 
the 
revolutions 
resulting 
from 
this 
event. 
The 
two 
antagonists 
were 
reconciled; 
the 
boundary 
lines 
to 
be 
observed 
henceforth 
by 
each 
were 
sharply 
defined, 
and 
there 
was 
to 
be 
a 
periodical 
exchange 
of 
gifts 
of 
esteem. 
At 
bottom, 
however, 
the 
chasm 
was 
not 
bridged 
over. 
But 
if 
we 
observe 
how, 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
this 
treaty 
of 
peace, 
the 
Dionysian 
power 
revealed 
itself, 
we 
shall 
now 
recognize 
in 
the 
Dionysian 
orgies 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
Babylonian 
Sacaea 
with 
their 
reversion 
of 
man 
to 
the 
tiger 
and 
the 
ape, 
the 
significance 
of 
festivals 
of 
world 
redemption 
and 
days 
of 
transfiguration. 
It 
is 
with 
them 
that 
nature 
for 
the 
first 
time 
attains 
her 
artistic 
jubilee; 
it 
is 
with 
them 
that 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
principium 
individuationis 
for 
the 
first 
time 
becomes 
an 
artistic 
phenomenon. 


The 
horrible 
“witches’ 
brew” 
of 
sensuality 
and 
cruelty 
becomes 
ineffective; 
only 
the 
curious 
blending 
and 
duality 
in 
the 
emotions 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
revelers 
remind 
us—as 
medicines 
remind 
us 
of 
deadly 
poisons— 



of 
the 
phenomenon 
that 
pain 
begets 
joy, 
that 
ecstasy 
may 
wring 
sounds 
of 
agony 
from 
us. 
At 
the 
very 
climax 
of 
joy 
there 
sounds 
a 
cry 
of 
horror 
or 
a 
yearning 
lamentation 
for 
an 
irretrievable 
loss. 
In 
these 
Greek 
festivals, 
nature 
seems 
to 
reveal 
a 
sentimental1 
trait; 
it 
is 
as 
if 
she 
were 
heaving 
a 
sigh 
at 
her 
dismenberment 
into 
individuals. 
The 
song 
and 
pantomime 
of 
such 
dually-
minded 
revelers 
was 
something 
new 
and 
unheard-of 
in 
the 
Homeric-Greek 
world; 
and 
the 
Dionysian 
music 
in 
particular 
excited 
awe 
and 
terror. 
If 
music, 
as 
it 
would 
seem, 
had 
been 
known 
previously 
as 
an 
Apollinian 
art, 
it 
was 
so, 
strictly 
speaking, 
only 
as 
the 
wave 
beat 
of 
rhythm, 
whose 
formative 
power 
was 
developed 
for 
the 
representation 
of 
Apollinian 
states. 
The 
music 
of 
Apollo 
was 
Doric 
architectonics 
in 
tones, 
but 
in 
tones 
that 
were 
merely 
suggestive, 
such 
as 
those 
of 
the 
cithara. 
The 
very 
element 
which 
forms 
the 
essence 
of 
Dionysian 
music 
(and 
hence 
of 
music 
in 
general) 
is 
carefully 
excluded 
as 
un-Apollinian—namely, 
the 
emotional 
power 
of 
the 
tone, 
the 
uniform 
flow 
of 
the 
melody, 
and 
the 
utterly 
incomparable 
world 
of 
harmony. 
In 
the 
Dionysian 
dithyramb 
man 
is 
incited 
to 
the 
greatest 
exaltation 
of 
all 
his 
symbolic 
faculties; 
something 
never 
before 
experienced 
struggles 
for 
utterance—the 
annihilation 
of 
the 
veil 
of 
māyā, 
oneness 
as 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
race 
and 
of 
nature 
itself. 
The 
essence 
of 
nature 
is 
now 
to 
be 
expressed 
symbolically; 
we 
need 
a 
new 
world 
of 
symbols; 
and 
the 
entire 
symbolism 
of 
the 
body 
is 
called 
into 
play, 
not 
the 
mere 
symbolism 
of 
the 
lips, 
face, 
and 
speech 
but 
the 
whole 
pantomime 
of 
dancing, 
forcing 
every 
member 
into 
rhythmic 
movement. 
Then 
the 
other 
symbolic 
powers 
suddenly 
press 
forward, 
particularly 
those 
of 
music, 
in 
rhythmics, 
dynamics, 
and 
harmony. 
To 
grasp 
this 
collective 
release 
of 
all 
the 
symbolic 
powers, 
man 
must 
have 
already 
attained 
that 
height 
of 
self-abnegation 
which 
seeks 
to 
express 
itself 
symbolically 
through 
all 
these 
powers—and 
so 
the 
dithyrambic 
votary 
of 
Dionysus 
is 
understood 
only 
by 
his 
peers. 
With 
what 
astonishment 
must 
the 
Apollinian 
Greek 
have 
beheld 
him! 
With 
an 
astonishment 
that 
was 
all 
the 
greater 
the 
more 
it 
was 
mingled 
with 
the 
shuddering 
suspicion 
that 
all 
this 
was 
actually 
not 
so 
very 
alien 
to 
him 
after 
all, 
in 
fact, 
that 
it 
was 
only 
his 
Apollinian 
consciousness 
which, 
like 
a 
veil, 
hid 
this 
Dionysian 
world 
from 
his 
vision. 



3 


To 
understand 
this, 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
level 
the 
artistic 
structure 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
culture, 
as 
it 
were, 
stone 
by 
stone, 
till 
the 
foundations 
on 
which 
it 
rests 
become 
visible. 
First 
of 
all 
we 
see 
the 
glorious 
Olympian 
figures 
of 
the 
gods, 
standing 
on 
the 
gables 
of 
this 
structure. 
Their 
deeds, 
pictured 
in 
brilliant 
reliefs, 
adorn 
its 
friezes. 
We 
must 
not 
be 
misled 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Apollo 
stands 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
others 
as 
an 
individual 
deity, 
without 
any 
claim 
to 
priority 
of 
rank. 
For 
the 
same 
impulse 
that 
embodied 
itself 
in 
Apollo 
gave 
birth 
to 
this 
entire 
Olympian 
world, 
and 
in 
this 
sense 
Apollo 
is 
its 
father. 
What 
terrific 
need 
was 
it 
that 
could 
produce 
such 
an 
illustrious 
company 
of 
Olympian 
beings? 


Whoever 
approaches 
these 
Olympians 
with 
another 
religion 
in 
his 
heart, 
searching 
among 
them 
for 
moral 
elevation, 
even 
for 
sanctity, 
for 
disincarnate 
spirituality, 
for 
charity 
and 
benevolence, 
will 
soon 
be 
forced 
to 
turn 
his 
back 
on 
them, 
discouraged 
and 
disappointed. 
For 
there 
is 
nothing 
here 
that 
suggests 
asceticism, 
spirituality, 
or 
duty. 
We 
hear 
nothing 
but 
the 
accents 
of 
an 
exuberant, 
triumphant 
life 
in 
which 
all 
things, 
whether 
good 
or 
evil, 
are 
deified.1 
And 
so 
the 
spectator 
may 
stand 
quite 
bewildered 
before 
this 
fantastic 
excess 
of 
life, 
asking 
himself 
by 
virtue 
of 
what 
magic 
potion 
these 
high-spirited 
men 
could 
have 
found 
life 
so 
enjoyable 
that, 
wherever 
they 
turned, 
their 
eyes 
beheld 
the 
smile 
of 
Helen, 
the 
ideal 
picture 
of 
their 
own 
existence, 
“floating 
in 
sweet 
sensuality.” 
But 
to 
this 
spectator, 
who 
has 
already 
turned 
his 
back, 
we 
must 
say: 
“Do 
not 
go 
away, 
but 
stay 
and 
hear 
what 
Greek 
folk 
wisdom 
has 
to 
say 
of 
this 
very 
life, 
which 
with 
such 
inexplicable 
gaiety 
unfolds 
itself 
before 
your 
eyes. 


“There 
is 
an 
ancient 
story 
that 
King 
Midas 
hunted 
in 
the 
forest 
a 
long 
time 
for 
the 
wise 
Silenus, 
the 
companion 
of 
Dionysus, 
without 
capturing 
him. 
When 
Silenus 
at 
last 
fell 
into 
his 
hands, 
the 
king 
asked 
what 
was 
the 
best 
and 
most 
desirable 
of 
all 
things 
for 
man. 
Fixed 
and 
immovable, 
the 
demigod 
said 
not 
a 
word, 
till 
at 
last, 
urged 
by 
the 
king, 
he 
gave 
a 
shrill 
laugh 
and 
broke 
out 
into 
these 
words: 
‘Oh, 
wretched 
ephemeral 
race, 
children 
of 
chance 
and 
misery, 
why 
do 
you 
compel 
me 
to 
tell 
you 
what 
it 
would 
be 
most 
expedient 



for 
you 
not 
to 
hear? 
What 
is 
best 
of 
all 
is 
utterly 
beyond 
your 
reach: 
not 
to 
be 
born, 
not 
to 
be, 
to 
be 
nothing. 
But 
the 
second 
best 
for 
you 
is—to 
die 
soon.’ 
”2 


How 
is 
the 
world 
of 
the 
Olympian 
gods 
related 
to 
this 
folk 
wisdom? 
Even 
as 
the 
rapturous 
vision 
of 
the 
tortured 
martyr 
to 
his 
suffering. 


Now 
it 
is 
as 
if 
the 
Olympian 
magic 
mountain3 
had 
opened 
before 
us 
and 
revealed 
its 
roots 
to 
us. 
The 
Greek 
knew 
and 
felt 
the 
terror 
and 
horror 
of 
existence. 
That 
he 
might 
endure 
this 
terror 
at 
all, 
he 
had 
to 
interpose 
between 
himself 
and 
life 
the 
radiant 
dream-birth 
of 
the 
Olympians. 
That 
overwhelming 
dismay 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
titanic 
powers 
of 
nature, 
the 
Moira4 
enthroned 
inexorably 
over 
all 
knowledge, 
the 
vulture 
of 
the 
great 
lover 
of 
mankind, 
Prometheus, 
the 
terrible 
fate 
of 
the 
wise 
Oedipus, 
the 
family 
curse 
of 
the 
Atridae 
which 
drove 
Orestes 
to 
matricide: 
in 
short, 
that 
entire 
philosophy 
of 
the 
sylvan 
god, 
with 
its 
mythical 
exemplars, 
which 
caused 
the 
downfall 
of 
the 
melancholy 
Etruscans—all 
this 
was 
again 
and 
again 
overcome 
by 
the 
Greeks 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
Olympian 
middle 
world 
of 
art; 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
it 
was 
veiled 
and 
withdrawn 
from 
sight. 
It 
was 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
live 
that 
the 
Greeks 
had 
to 
create 
these 
gods 
from 
a 
most 
profound 
need. 
Perhaps 
we 
may 
picture 
the 
process 
to 
ourselves 
somewhat 
as 
follows: 
out 
of 
the 
original 
Titanic 
divine 
order 
of 
terror, 
the 
Olympian 
divine 
order 
of 
joy 
gradually 
evolved 
through 
the 
Apollinian 
impulse 
toward 
beauty, 
just 
as 
roses 
burst 
from 
thorny 
bushes. 
How 
else 
could 
this 
people, 
so 
sensitive, 
so 
vehement 
in 
its 
desires, 
so 
singularly 
capable 
of 
suffering, 
have 
endured 
existence, 
if 
it 
had 
not 
been 
revealed 
to 
them 
in 
their 
gods, 
surrounded 
with 
a 
higher 
glory? 


The 
same 
impulse 
which 
calls 
art 
into 
being, 
as 
the 
complement 
and 
consummation, 
of 
existence, 
seducing 
one 
to 
a 
continuation 
of 
life, 
was 
also 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Olympian 
world 
which 
the 
Hellenic 
“will” 
made 
use 
of 
as 
a 
transfiguring 
mirror. 
Thus 
do 
the 
gods 
justify 
the 
life 
of 
man: 
they 
themselves 
live 
it—the 
only 
satisfactory 
theodicy! 
Existence 
under 
the 
bright 
sunshine 
of 
such 
gods 
is 
regarded 
as 
desirable 
in 
itself, 
and 
the 
real 
pain 
of 
Homeric 
men 
is 
caused 
by 
parting 
from 
it, 
especially 
by 
early 
parting: 
so 
that 
now, 
reversing 
the 
wisdom 
of 
Silenus, 
we 
might 
say 
of 
the 
Greeks 
that 
“to 
die 
soon 
is 
worst 
of 
all 
for 
them, 
the 
next 
worst—to 
die 
at 
all.” 
Once 
heard, 
it 
will 
ring 
out 
again; 
do 
not 
forget 
the 
lament 
of 
the 
short-lived 
Achilles, 
mourning 
the 
leaflike 
change 
and 
vicissitudes 
of 
the 
race 
of 
men 
and 
the 
decline 
of 
the 
heroic 
age. 
It 
is 
not 
unworthy 
of 
the 
greatest 
hero 
to 
long 
for 
a 
continuation 
of 
life, 
even 
though 
he 
live 
as 
a 
day 
laborer.5 
At 
the 
Apollinian 
stage 
of 



development, 
the 
“will” 
longs 
so 
vehemently 
for 
this 
existence, 
the 
Homeric 
man 
feels 
himself 
so 
completely 
at 
one 
with 
it, 
that 
lamentation 
itself 
becomes 
a 
song 
of 
praise. 


Here 
we 
should 
note 
that 
this 
harmony 
which 
is 
contemplated 
with 
such 
longing 
by 
modern 
man, 
in 
fact, 
this 
oneness 
of 
man 
with 
nature 
(for 
which 
Schiller 
introduced 
the 
technical 
term 
“naïve”), 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
simple 
condition 
that 
comes 
into 
being 
naturally 
and 
as 
if 
inevitably. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
condition 
that, 
like 
a 
terrestrial 
paradise, 
must 
necessarily 
be 
found 
at 
the 
gate 
of 
every 
culture. 
Only 
a 
romantic 
age 
could 
believe 
this, 
an 
age 
which 
conceived 
of 
the 
artist 
in 
terms 
of 
Rousseau’s 
Emile 
and 
imagined 
that 
in 
Homer 
it 
had 
found 
such 
an 
artist 
Emile, 
reared 
at 
the 
bosom 
of 
nature. 
Where 
we 
encounter 
the 
“naïve” 
in 
art, 
we 
should 
recognize 
the 
highest 
effect 
of 
Apollinian 
culture—which 
always 
must 
first 
overthrow 
an 
empire 
of 
Titans 
and 
slay 
monsters, 
and 
which 
must 
have 
triumphed 
over 
an 
abysmal 
and 
terrifying 
view 
of 
the 
world 
and 
the 
keenest 
susceptibility 
to 
suffering 
through 
recourse 
to 
the 
most 
forceful 
and 
pleasurable 
illusions. 
But 
how 
rarely 
is 
the 
naïve 
attained—that 
consummate 
immersion 
in 
the 
beauty 
of 
mere 
appearance! 
How 
unutterably 
sublime 
is 
Homer 
therefore, 
who, 
as 
an 
individual 
being, 
bears 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
this 
Apollinian 
folk 
culture 
as 
the 
individual 
dream 
artist 
does 
to 
the 
dream 
faculty 
of 
the 
people 
and 
of 
nature 
in 
general. 


The 
Homeric 
“naïveté” 
can 
be 
understood 
only 
as 
the 
complete 
victory 
of 
Apollinian 
illusion: 
this 
is 
one 
of 
those 
illusions 
which 
nature 
so 
frequently 
employs 
to 
achieve 
her 
own 
ends. 
The 
true 
goal 
is 
veiled 
by 
a 
phantasm: 
and 
while 
we 
stretch 
out 
our 
hands 
for 
the 
latter, 
nature 
attains 
the 
former 
by 
means 
of 
our 
illusion. 
In 
the 
Greeks 
the 
“will” 
wished 
to 
contemplate 
itself 
in 
the 
transfiguration 
of 
genius 
and 
the 
world 
of 
art; 
in 
order 
to 
glorify 
themselves, 
its 
creatures 
had 
to 
feel 
themselves 
worthy 
of 
glory; 
they 
had 
to 
behold 
themselves 
again 
in 
a 
higher 
sphere, 
without 
this 
perfect 
world 
of 
contemplation 
acting 
as 
a 
command 
or 
a 
reproach. 
This 
is 
the 
sphere 
of 
beauty, 
in 
which 
they 
saw 
their 
mirror 
images, 
the 
Olympians. 
With 
this 
mirroring 
of 
beauty 
the 
Hellenic 
will 
combated 
its 
artistically 
correlative 
talent 
for 
suffering 
and 
for 
the 
wisdom 
of 
suffering—and, 
as 
a 
monument 
of 
its 
victory, 
we 
have 
Homer, 
the 
naïve 
artist. 



4 


Now 
the 
dream 
analogy 
may 
throw 
some 
light 
on 
the 
naïve 
artist. 
Let 
us 
imagine 
the 
dreamer: 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
illusion 
of 
the 
dream 
world 
and 
without 
disturbing 
it, 
he 
calls 
out 
to 
himself: 
“It 
is 
a 
dream, 
I 
will 
dream 
on.” 
What 
must 
we 
infer? 
That 
he 
experiences 
a 
deep 
inner 
joy 
in 
dream 
contemplation; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
be 
at 
all 
able 
to 
dream 
with 
this 
inner 
joy 
in 
contemplation, 
he 
must 
have 
completely 
lost 
sight 
of 
the 
waking 
reality 
and 
its 
ominous 
obtrusiveness. 
Guided 
by 
the 
dream-reading 
Apollo, 
we 
may 
interpret 
all 
these 
phenomena 
in 
roughly 
this 
way. 


Though 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
of 
the 
two 
halves 
of 
our 
existence, 
the 
waking 
and 
the 
dreaming 
states, 
the 
former 
appeals 
to 
us 
as 
infinitely 
preferable, 
more 
important, 
excellent, 
and 
worthy 
of 
being 
lived, 
indeed, 
as 
that 
which 
alone 
is 
lived—yet 
in 
relation 
to 
that 
mysterious 
ground 
of 
our 
being 
of 
which 
we 
are 
the 
phenomena, 
I 
should, 
paradoxical 
as 
it 
may 
seem, 
maintain 
the 
very 
opposite 
estimate 
of 
the 
value 
of 
dreams. 
For 
the 
more 
clearly 
I 
perceive 
in 
nature 
those 
omnipotent 
art 
impulses, 
and 
in 
them 
an 
ardent 
longing 
for 
illusion, 
for 
redemption 
through 
illusion, 
the 
more 
I 
feel 
myself 
impelled 
to 
the 
metaphysical 
assumption 
that 
the 
truly 
existent 
primal 
unity, 
eternally 
suffering 
and 
contradictory, 
also 
needs 
the 
rapturous 
vision, 
the 
pleasurable 
illusion, 
for 
its 
continuous 
redemption. 
And 
we, 
completely 
wrapped 
up 
in 
this 
illusion 
and 
composed 
of 
it, 
are 
compelled 
to 
consider 
this 
illusion 
as 
the 
truly 
nonexistent—i.e., 
as 
a 
perpetual 
becoming 
in 
time, 
space, 
and 
causality 
—in 
other 
words, 
as 
empirical 
reality. 
If, 
for 
the 
moment, 
we 
do 
not 
consider 
the 
question 
of 
our 
own 
“reality,” 
if 
we 
conceive 
of 
our 
empirical 
existence, 
and 
of 
that 
of 
the 
world 
in 
general, 
as 
a 
continuously 
manifested 
representation 
of 
the 
primal 
unity, 
we 
shall 
then 
have 
to 
look 
upon 
the 
dream 
as 
a 
mere 
appearance 
of 
mere 
appearance, 
hence 
as 
a 
still 
higher 
appeasement 
of 
the 
primordial 
desire 
for 
mere 
appearance. 
And 
that 
is 
why 
the 
innermost 
heart 
of 
nature 
feels 
that 
ineffable 
joy 
in 
the 
naïve 
artist 
and 
the 
naïve 
work 
of 
art, 
which 
is 
likewise 
only 
“mere 
appearance 
of 
mere 
appearance.” 


In 
a 
symbolic 
painting, 
Raphael, 
himself 
one 
of 
these 
immortal 
“naïve” 
ones, 
has 
represented 
for 
us 
this 
demotion 
of 
appearance 
to 
the 
level 
of 
mere 



appearance, 
the 
primitive 
process 
of 
the 
naïve 
artist 
and 
of 
Apollinian 
culture. 
In 
his 
Transfiguration, 
the 
lower 
half 
of 
the 
picture, 
with 
the 
possessed 
boy, 
the 
despairing 
bearers, 
the 
bewildered, 
terrified 
disciples, 
shows 
us 
the 
reflection 
of 
suffering, 
primal 
and 
eternal, 
the 
sole 
ground 
of 
the 
world: 
the 
“mere 
appearance” 
here 
is 
the 
reflection 
of 
eternal 
contradiction, 
the 
father 
of 
things. 
From 
this 
mere 
appearance 
arises, 
like 
ambrosial 
vapor, 
a 
new 
visionary 
world 
of 
mere 
appearances, 
invisible 
to 
those 
wrapped 
in 
the 
first 
appearance—a 
radiant 
floating 
in 
purest 
bliss, 
a 
serene 
contemplation 
beaming 
from 
wide-open 
eyes. 
Here 
we 
have 
presented, 
in 
the 
most 
sublime 
artistic 
symbolism, 
that 
Apollinian 
world 
of 
beauty 
and 
its 
substratum, 
the 
terrible 
wisdom 
of 
Silenus; 
and 
intuitively 
we 
comprehend 
their 
necessary 
interdependence. 
Apollo, 
however, 
again 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
apotheosis 
of 
the 
principium 
individuationis, 
in 
which 
alone 
is 
consummated 
the 
perpetually 
attained 
goal 
of 
the 
primal 
unity, 
its 
redemption 
through 
mere 
appearance. 
With 
his 
sublime 
gestures, 
he 
shows 
us 
how 
necessary 
is 
the 
entire 
world 
of 
suffering, 
that 
by 
means 
of 
it 
the 
individual 
may 
be 
impelled 
to 
realize 
the 
redeeming 
vision, 
and 
then, 
sunk 
in 
contemplation 
of 
it, 
sit 
quietly 
in 
his 
tossing 
bark, 
amid 
the 
waves. 


If 
we 
conceive 
of 
it 
at 
all 
as 
imperative 
and 
mandatory, 
this 
apotheosis 
of 
individuation 
knows 
but 
one 
law—the 
individual, 
i.e., 
the 
delimiting 
of 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
individual, 
measure 
in 
the 
Hellenic 
sense. 
Apollo, 
as 
ethical 
deity, 
exacts 
measure 
of 
his 
disciples, 
and, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
maintain 
it, 
he 
requires 
self-knowledge. 
And 
so, 
side 
by 
side 
with 
the 
aesthetic 
necessity 
for 
beauty, 
there 
occur 
the 
demands 
“know 
thyself 
and 
“nothing 
in 
excess”; 
consequently 
overweening 
pride 
and 
excess 
are 
regarded 
as 
the 
truly 
hostile 
demons 
of 
the 
non-Apollinian 
sphere, 
hence 
as 
characteristics 
of 
the 
pre-
Apollinian 
age—that 
of 
the 
Titans; 
and 
of 
the 
extra-Apollinian 
world—that 
of 
the 
barbarians. 
Because 
of 
his 
titanic 
love 
for 
man, 
Prometheus 
must 
be 
torn 
to 
pieces 
by 
vultures; 
because 
of 
his 
excessive 
wisdom, 
which 
could 
solve 
the 
riddle 
of 
the 
Sphinx, 
Oedipus 
must 
be 
plunged 
into 
a 
bewildering 
vortex 
of 
crime. 
Thus 
did 
the 
Delphic 
god 
interpret 
the 
Greek 
past. 


The 
effects 
wrought 
by 
the 
Dionysian 
also 
seemed 
“titanic” 
and 
“barbaric” 
to 
the 
Apollinian 
Greek; 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
could 
not 
conceal 
from 
himself 
that 
he, 
too, 
was 
inwardly 
related 
to 
these 
overthrown 
Titans 
and 
heroes. 
Indeed, 
he 
had 
to 
recognize 
even 
more 
than 
this: 
despite 
all 
its 
beauty 
and 
moderation, 
his 
entire 
existence 
rested 
on 
a 
hidden 
substratum 
of 
suffering 
and 
of 
knowledge, 
revealed 
to 
him 
by 
the 
Dionysian. 
And 
behold: 



Apollo 
could 
not 
live 
without 
Dionysus! 
The 
“titanic” 
and 
the 
“barbaric” 
were 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
as 
necessary 
as 
the 
Apollinian. 


And 
now 
let 
us 
imagine 
how 
into 
this 
world, 
built 
on 
mere 
appearance 
and 
moderation 
and 
artificially 
dammed 
up, 
there 
penetrated, 
in 
tones 
ever 
more 
bewitching 
and 
alluring, 
the 
ecstatic 
sound 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
festival; 
how 
in 
these 
strains 
all 
of 
nature’s 
excess 
in 
pleasure, 
grief, 
and 
knowledge 
became 
audible, 
even 
in 
piercing 
shrieks; 
and 
let 
us 
ask 
ourselves 
what 
the 
psalmodizing 
artist 
of 
Apollo, 
with 
his 
phantom 
harp-sound, 
could 
mean 
in 
the 
face 
of 
this 
demonic 
folk-song! 
The 
muses 
of 
the 
arts 
of 
“illusion” 
paled 
before 
an 
art 
that, 
in 
its 
intoxication, 
spoke 
the 
truth. 
The 
wisdom 
of 
Silenus 
cried 
“Woe! 
woe!” 
to 
the 
serene 
Olympians. 
The 
individual, 
with 
all 
his 
restraint 
and 
proportion, 
succumbed 
to 
the 
self-oblivion 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
states, 
forgetting 
the 
precepts 
of 
Apollo. 
Excess 
revealed 
itself 
as 
truth. 
Contradiction, 
the 
bliss 
born 
of 
pain, 
spoke 
out 
from 
the 
very 
heart 
of 
nature. 
And 
so, 
wherever 
the 
Dionysian 
prevailed, 
the 
Apollinian 
was 
checked 
and 
destroyed. 
But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
equally 
certain 
that, 
wherever 
the 
first 
Dionysian 
onslaught 
was 
successfully 
withstood, 
the 
authority 
and 
majesty 
of 
the 
Delphic 
god 
exhibited 
itself 
as 
more 
rigid 
and 
menacing 
than 
ever. 
For 
to 
me 
the 
Doric 
state1 
and 
Doric 
art 
are 
explicable 
only 
as 
a 
permanent 
military 
encampment 
of 
the 
Apollinian. 
Only 
incessant 
resistance 
to 
the 
titanic-
barbaric 
nature 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
could 
account 
for 
the 
long 
survival 
of 
an 
art 
so 
defiantly 
prim 
and 
so 
encompassed 
with 
bulwarks, 
a 
training 
so 
warlike 
and 
rigorous, 
and 
a 
political 
structure 
so 
cruel 
and 
relentless. 


Up 
to 
this 
point 
we 
have 
simply 
enlarged 
upon 
the 
observation 
made 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
essay: 
that 
the 
Dionysian 
and 
the 
Apollinian, 
in 
new 
births 
ever 
following 
and 
mutually 
augmenting 
one 
another, 
controlled 
the 
Hellenic 
genius; 
that 
out 
of 
the 
age 
of 
“bronze,” 
with 
its 
wars 
of 
the 
Titans 
and 
its 
rigorous 
folk 
philosophy, 
the 
Homeric 
world 
developed 
under 
the 
sway 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
impulse 
to 
beauty; 
that 
this 
“naïve” 
splendor 
was 
again 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 
influx 
of 
the 
Dionysian; 
and 
that 
against 
this 
new 
power 
the 
Apollinian 
rose 
to 
the 
austere 
majesty 
of 
Doric 
art 
and 
the 
Doric 
view 
of 
the 
world. 
If 
amid 
the 
strife 
of 
these 
two 
hostile 
principles, 
the 
older 
Hellenic 
history 
thus 
falls 
into 
four 
great 
periods 
of 
art, 
we 
are 
now 
impelled 
to 
inquire 
after 
the 
final 
goal 
of 
these 
developments 
and 
processes, 
lest 
perchance 
we 
should 
regard 
the 
last-attained 
period, 
the 
period 
of 
Doric 
art, 
as 
the 
climax 
and 
aim 
of 
these 
artistic 
impulses. 
And 
here 
the 
sublime 
and 
celebrated 
art 
of 
Attic 
tragedy 
and 
the 
dramatic 
dithyramb 
presents 
itself 
as 
the 
common 
goal 



of 
both 
these 
tendencies 
whose 
mysterious 
union, 
after 
many 
and 
long 
precursory 
struggles, 
found 
glorius 
consummation 
in 
this 
child—at 
once 
Antigone 
and 
Cassandra.2 



5 


We 
now 
approach 
the 
real 
goal 
of 
our 
investigation, 
which 
is 
directed 
toward 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Dionysian-Apollinian 
genius 
and 
its 
art 
product, 
or 
at 
least 
toward 
some 
feeling 
for 
and 
understanding 
of 
this 
mystery 
of 
union. 
Here 
we 
shall 
begin 
by 
seeking 
the 
first 
evidence 
in 
Greece 
of 
that 
new 
germ 
which 
subsequently 
developed 
into 
tragedy 
and 
the 
dramatic 
dithyramb. 
The 
ancients 
themselves 
give 
us 
a 
symbolic 
answer, 
when 
they 
place 
the 
faces 
of 
Homer 
and 
Archilochus,1 
as 
the 
forefathers 
and 
torchbearers 
of 
Greek 
poetry, 
side 
by 
side 
on 
gems, 
sculptures, 
etc., 
with 
a 
sure 
feeling 
that 
consideration 
should 
be 
given 
only 
to 
these 
two, 
equally 
completely 
original, 
from 
whom 
a 
stream 
of 
fire 
flows 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
later 
Greek 
history. 
Homer, 
the 
aged 
self-absorbed 
dreamer, 
the 
type 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
naïve 
artist, 
now 
beholds 
with 
astonishment 
the 
passionate 
head 
of 
the 
warlike 
votary 
of 
the 
muses, 
Archilochus, 
who 
was 
hunted 
savagely 
through 
life. 
Modern 
aesthetics, 
by 
way 
of 
interpretation, 
could 
only 
add 
that 
here 
the 
first 
“objective” 
artist 
confronts 
the 
first 
“subjective” 
artist. 
But 
this 
interpretation 
helps 
us 
little, 
because 
we 
know 
the 
subjective 
artist 
only 
as 
the 
poor 
artist, 
and 
throughout 
the 
entire 
range 
of 
art 
we 
demand 
first 
of 
all 
the 
conquest 
of 
the 
subjective, 
redemption 
from 
the 
“ego,” 
and 
the 
silencing 
of 
the 
individual 
will 
and 
desire; 
indeed, 
we 
find 
it 
impossible 
to 
believe 
in 
any 
truly 
artistic 
production, 
however 
insignificant, 
if 
it 
is 
without 
objectivity, 
without 
pure 
contemplation 
devoid 
of 
interest.2 
Hence 
our 
aesthetics 
must 
first 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
how 
the 
“lyrist” 
is 
possible 
as 
an 
artist—he 
who, 
according 
to 
the 
experience 
of 
all 
ages, 
is 
continually 
saying 
“I” 
and 
running 
through 
the 
entire 
chromatic 
scale 
of 
his 
passions 
and 
desires. 
Compared 
with 
Homer, 
Archilochus 
appalls 
us 
by 
his 
cries 
of 
hatred 
and 
scorn, 
by 
his 
drunken 
outbursts 
of 
desire. 
Therefore 
is 
not 
he, 
who 
has 
been 
called 
the 
first 
subjective 
artist, 
essentially 
the 
non-artist? 
But 
in 
this 
case, 
how 
explain 
the 
reverence 
which 
was 
shown 
to 
him—the 
poet—in 
very 
remarkable 
utterances 
by 
the 
Delphic 
oracle 
itself, 
the 
center 
of 
“objective” 
art? 


Schiller 
has 
thrown 
some 
light 
on 
the 
poetic 
process 
by 
a 
psychological 
observation, 
inexplicable 
but 
unproblematic 
to 
his 
own 
mind. 
He 
confessed 



that 
before 
the 
act 
of 
creation 
he 
did 
not 
have 
before 
him 
or 
within 
him 
any 
series 
of 
images 
in 
a 
causal 
arrangement, 
but 
rather 
a 
musical 
mood. 
(“With 
me 
the 
perception 
has 
at 
first 
no 
clear 
and 
definite 
object; 
this 
is 
formed 
later. 
A 
certain 
musical 
mood 
comes 
first, 
and 
the 
poetical 
idea 
only 
follows 
later.”) 
Let 
us 
add 
to 
this 
the 
most 
important 
phenomenon 
of 
all 
ancient 
lyric 
poetry: 
they 
took 
for 
granted 
the 
union, 
indeed 
the 
identity, 
of 
the 
lyrist 
with 
the 
musician. 
Compared 
with 
this, 
our 
modern 
lyric 
poetry 
seems 
like 
the 
statue 
of 
a 
god 
without 
a 
head. 
With 
this 
in 
mind 
we 
may 
now, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
our 
aesthetical 
metaphysics 
set 
forth 
above, 
explain 
the 
lyrist 
to 
ourselves 
in 
this 
manner. 


In 
the 
first 
place, 
as 
a 
Dionysian 
artist 
he 
has 
identified 
himself 
with 
the 
primal 
unity, 
its 
pain 
and 
contradiction. 
Assuming 
that 
music 
has 
been 
correctly 
termed 
a 
repetition 
and 
a 
recast 
of 
the 
world, 
we 
may 
say 
that 
he 
produces 
the 
copy 
of 
this 
primal 
unity 
as 
music. 
Now, 
however, 
under 
the 
Apollinian 
dream 
inspiration, 
this 
music 
reveals 
itself 
to 
him 
again 
as 
a 
symbolic 
dream 
image. 
The 
inchoate, 
intangible 
reflection 
of 
the 
primordial 
pain 
in 
music, 
with 
its 
redemption 
in 
mere 
appearance, 
now 
produces 
a 
second 
mirroring 
as 
a 
specific 
symbol 
or 
example. 
The 
artist 
has 
already 
surrendered 
his 
subjectivity 
in 
the 
Dionysian 
process. 
The 
image 
that 
now 
shows 
him 
his 
identity 
with 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
world 
is 
a 
dream 
scene 
that 
embodies 
the 
primordial 
contradiction 
and 
primordial 
pain, 
together 
with 
the 
primordial 
pleasure, 
of 
mere 
appearance. 
The 
“I” 
of 
the 
lyrist 
therefore 
sounds 
from 
the 
depth 
of 
his 
being: 
its 
“subjectivity,” 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
modern 
aestheticians 
is 
a 
fiction. 
When 
Archilochus, 
the 
first 
Greek 
lyrist, 
proclaims 
to 
the 
daughters 
of 
Lycambes 
both 
his 
mad 
love 
and 
his 
contempt, 
it 
is 
not 
his 
passion 
alone 
that 
dances 
before 
us 
in 
orgiastic 
frenzy; 
but 
we 
see 
Dionysus 
and 
the 
Maenads, 
we 
see 
the 
drunken 
reveler 
Archilochus 
sunk 
down 
in 
slumber—as 
Euripides 
depicts 
it 
in 
the 
Bacchae,3 
the 
sleep 
on 
the 
high 
mountain 
pasture, 
in 
the 
noonday 
sun. 
And 
now 
Apollo 
approaches 
and 
touches 
him 
with 
the 
laurel. 
Then 
the 
Dionysian-musical 
enchantment 
of 
the 
sleeper 
seems 
to 
emit 
image 
sparks, 
lyrical 
poems, 
which 
in 
their 
highest 
development 
are 
called 
tragedies 
and 
dramatic 
dithyrambs. 


The 
plastic 
artist, 
like 
the 
epic 
poet 
who 
is 
related 
to 
him, 
is 
absorbed 
in 
the 
pure 
contemplation 
of 
images. 
The 
Dionysian 
musician 
is, 
without 
any 
images, 
himself 
pure 
primordial 
pain 
and 
its 
primordial 
re-echoing. 
The 
lyric 
genius 
is 
conscious 
of 
a 
world 
of 
images 
and 
symbols—growing 
out 
of 
his 
state 
of 
mystical 
self-abnegation 
and 
oneness. 
This 
world 
has 
a 
coloring, 
a 



causality, 
and 
a 
velocity 
quite 
different 
from 
those 
of 
the 
world 
of 
the 
plastic 
artist 
and 
the 
epic 
poet. 
For 
the 
latter 
lives 
in 
these 
images, 
and 
only 
in 
them, 
with 
joyous 
satisfaction. 
He 
never 
grows 
tired 
of 
contemplating 
lovingly 
even 
their 
minutest 
traits. 
Even 
the 
image 
of 
the 
angry 
Achilles 
is 
only 
an 
image 
to 
him 
whose 
angry 
expression 
he 
enjoys 
with 
the 
dreamer’s 
pleasure 
in 
illusion. 
Thus, 
by 
this 
mirror 
of 
illusion, 
he 
is 
protected 
against 
becoming 
one 
and 
fused 
with 
his 
figures. 
In 
direct 
contrast 
to 
this, 
the 
images 
of 
the 
lyrist 
are 
nothing 
but 
his 
very 
self 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
only 
different 
projections 
of 
himself, 
so 
he, 
as 
the 
moving 
center 
of 
this 
world, 
may 
say 
“I”: 
of 
course, 
this 
self 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
the 
waking, 
empirically 
real 
man, 
but 
the 
only 
truly 
existent 
and 
eternal 
self 
resting 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
things, 
through 
whose 
images 
the 
lyric 
genius 
sees 
this 
very 
basis. 


Now 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
among 
these 
images 
he 
also 
beholds 
himself 
as 
nongenius, 
i.e., 
his 
subject, 
the 
whole 
throng 
of 
subjective 
passions 
and 
agitations 
of 
the 
will 
directed 
to 
a 
definite 
object 
which 
appears 
real 
to 
him. 
It 
might 
seem 
as 
if 
the 
lyric 
genius 
and 
the 
allied 
non-genius 
were 
one, 
as 
if 
the 
former 
had 
of 
its 
own 
accord 
spoken 
that 
little 
word 
“I.” 
But 
this 
mere 
appearance 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
able 
to 
lead 
us 
astray, 
as 
it 
certainly 
led 
astray 
those 
who 
designated 
the 
lyrist 
as 
the 
subjective 
poet. 
For, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
Archilochus, 
the 
passionately 
inflamed, 
loving, 
and 
hating 
man, 
is 
but 
a 
vision 
of 
the 
genius, 
who 
by 
this 
time 
is 
no 
longer 
merely 
Archilochus, 
but 
a 
world-genius 
expressing 
his 
primordial 
pain 
symbolically 
in 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
man 
Archilochus—while 
the 
subjectively 
willing 
and 
desiring 
man, 
Archilochus, 
can 
never 
at 
any 
time 
be 
a 
poet. 
It 
is 
by 
no 
means 
necessary, 
however, 
that 
the 
lyrist 
should 
see 
nothing 
but 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
man 
Archilochus 
before 
him 
as 
a 
reflection 
of 
eternal 
being; 
and 
tragedy 
shows 
how 
far 
the 
visionary 
world 
of 
the 
lyrist 
may 
be 
removed 
from 
this 
phenomenon 
which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
is 
closest 
at 
hand.4 


Schopenhauer, 
who 
did 
not 
conceal 
from 
himself 
the 
difficulty 
the 
lyrist 
presents 
in 
the 
philosophical 
contemplation 
of 
art, 
thought 
he 
had 
found 
a 
way 
out 
on 
which, 
however, 
I 
cannot 
follow 
him. 
Actually, 
it 
was 
in 
his 
profound 
metaphysics 
of 
music 
that 
he 
alone 
held 
in 
his 
hands 
the 
means 
for 
a 
solution. 
I 
believe 
I 
have 
removed 
the 
difficulty 
here 
in 
his 
spirit 
and 
to 
his 
honor. 
Yet 
he 
describes 
the 
peculiar 
nature 
of 
song 
as 
follows 
(Welt 
als 
Wille 
und 
Vorstellung, 
I, 
p. 
295): 


“It 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
will, 
i.e., 
his 
own 
volition, 
which 
fills 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
singer, 
often 
as 
a 
released 
and 
satisfied 
desire 
(joy), 
but 



still 
oftener 
as 
an 
inhibited 
desire 
(grief), 
always 
as 
an 
affect, 
a 
passion, 
a 
moved 
state 
of 
mind. 
Besides 
this, 
however, 
and 
along 
with 
it, 
by 
the 
sight 
of 
surrounding 
nature, 
the 
singer 
becomes 
conscious 
of 
himself 
as 
the 
subject 
of 
pure 
will-less 
knowing, 
whose 
unbroken 
blissful 
peace 
now 
appears, 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
stress 
of 
desire, 
which 
is 
always 
restricted 
and 
always 
needy. 
The 
feeling 
of 
this 
contrast, 
this 
alternation, 
is 
really 
what 
the 
song 
as 
a 
whole 
expresses 
and 
what 
principally 
constitutes 
the 
lyrical 
state. 
In 
it 
pure 
knowing 
comes 
to 
us 
as 
it 
were 
to 
deliver 
us 
from 
willing 
and 
its 
strain; 
we 
follow, 
but 
only 
for 
moments; 
willing, 
the 
remembrance 
of 
our 
own 
personal 
ends, 
tears 
us 
anew 
from 
peaceful 
contemplation; 
yet 
ever 
again 
the 
next 
beautiful 
environment 
in 
which 
pure 
will-less 
knowledge 
presents 
itself 
to 
us 
lures 
us 
away 
from 
willing. 
Therefore, 
in 
the 
song 
and 
the 
lyrical 
mood, 
willing 
(the 
personal 
interest 
of 
the 
ends) 
and 
pure 
perception 
of 
the 
environment 
are 
wonderfully 
mingled; 
connections 
between 
them 
are 
sought 
and 
imagined; 
the 
subjective 
mood, 
the 
affection 
of 
the 
will, 
imparts 
its 
own 
hue 
to 
the 
perceived 
environment, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Genuine 
song 
is 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
this 
mingled 
and 
divided 
state 
of 
mind.” 


Who 
could 
fail 
to 
recognize 
in 
this 
description 
that 
lyric 
poetry 
is 
here 
characterized 
as 
an 
incompletely 
attained 
art 
that 
arrives 
at 
its 
goal 
infrequently 
and 
only, 
as 
it 
were, 
by 
leaps? 
Indeed, 
it 
is 
described 
as 
a 
semi-
art 
whose 
essence 
is 
said 
to 
consist 
in 
this, 
that 
willing 
and 
pure 
contemplation, 
i.e., 
the 
unaesthetic 
and 
the 
aesthetic 
condition, 
are 
wonderfully 
mingled 
with 
each 
other. 
We 
contend, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
the 
whole 
opposition 
between 
the 
subjective 
and 
objective, 
which 
Schopenhauer 
still 
uses 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
value 
in 
classifying 
the 
arts, 
is 
altogether 
irrelevant 
in 
aesthetics, 
since 
the 
subject, 
the 
willing 
individual 
that 
furthers 
his 
own 
egoistic 
ends, 
can 
be 
conceived 
of 
only 
as 
the 
antagonist, 
not 
as 
the 
origin 
of 
art. 
Insofar 
as 
the 
subject 
is 
the 
artist, 
however, 
he 
has 
already 
been 
released 
from 
his 
individual 
will, 
and 
has 
become, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
medium 
through 
which 
the 
one 
truly 
existent 
subject 
celebrates 
his 
release 
in 
appearance. 
For 
to 
our 
humiliation 
and 
exaltation, 
one 
thing 
above 
all 
must 
be 
clear 
to 
us. 
The 
entire 
comedy 
of 
art 
is 
neither 
performed 
for 
our 
betterment 
or 
education 
nor 
are 
we 
the 
true 
authors 
of 
this 
art 
world. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
we 
may 
assume 
that 
we 
are 
merely 
images 
and 
artistic 
projections 
for 
the 
true 
author, 
and 
that 
we 
have 
our 
highest 
dignity 
in 
our 
significance 
as 
works 
of 
art—for 
it 
is 
only 
as 
an 
aesthetic 
phenomenon 
that 
existence 
and 
the 
world 
are 
eternally 
justified5 
—while 
of 
course 
our 
consciousness 
of 
our 
own 
significance 
hardly 
differs 



from 
that 
which 
the 
soldiers 
painted 
on 
canvas 
have 
of 
the 
battle 
represented 
on 
it. 
Thus 
all 
our 
knowledge 
of 
art 
is 
basically 
quite 
illusory, 
because 
as 
knowing 
beings 
we 
are 
not 
one 
and 
identical 
with 
that 
being 
which, 
as 
the 
sole 
author 
and 
spectator 
of 
this 
comedy 
of 
art, 
prepares 
a 
perpetual 
entertainment 
for 
itself. 
Only 
insofar 
as 
the 
genius 
in 
the 
act 
of 
artistic 
creation 
coalesces 
with 
this 
primordial 
artist 
of 
the 
world, 
does 
he 
know 
anything 
of 
the 
eternal 
essence 
of 
art; 
for 
in 
this 
state 
he 
is, 
in 
a 
marvelous 
manner, 
like 
the 
weird 
image 
of 
the 
fairy 
tale 
which 
can 
turn 
its 
eyes 
at 
will 
and 
behold 
itself; 
he 
is 
at 
once 
subject 
and 
object, 
at 
once 
poet, 
actor, 
and 
spectator. 



6 


In 
connection 
with 
Archilochus, 
scholarly 
research 
has 
discovered 
that 
he 
introduced 
the 
folk 
song 
into 
literature 
and 
on 
account 
of 
this 
deserved, 
according 
to 
the 
general 
estimate 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
his 
unique 
position 
beside 
Homer. 
But 
what 
is 
the 
folk 
song 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
wholly 
Apollinian 
epos? 
What 
else 
but 
the 
perpetuum 
vestigium 
of 
a 
union 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian? 
Its 
enormous 
diffusion 
among 
all 
peoples, 
further 
re-enforced 
by 
ever-new 
births, 
is 
testimony 
to 
the 
power 
of 
this 
artistic 
dual 
impulse 
of 
nature, 
which 
leaves 
its 
vestiges 
in 
the 
folk 
song 
just 
as 
the 
orgiastic 
movements 
of 
a 
people 
immortalize 
themselves 
in 
its 
music. 
Indeed, 
it 
might 
also 
be 
historically 
demonstrable 
that 
every 
period 
rich 
in 
folk 
songs 
has 
been 
most 
violently 
stirred 
by 
Dionysian 
currents, 
which 
we 
must 
always 
consider 
the 
substratum 
and 
prerequisite 
of 
the 
folk 
song. 


First 
of 
all, 
however, 
we 
must 
conceive 
the 
folk 
song 
as 
the 
musical 
mirror 
of 
the 
world, 
as 
the 
original 
melody, 
now 
seeking 
for 
itself 
a 
parallel 
dream 
phenomenon 
and 
expressing 
it 
in 
poetry. 
Melody 
is 
therefore 
primary 
and 
universal, 
and 
so 
may 
admit 
of 
several 
objectifications 
in 
several 
texts. 
Likewise, 
in 
the 
naïve 
estimation 
of 
the 
people, 
it 
is 
regarded 
as 
by 
far 
the 
more 
important 
and 
essential 
element. 
Melody 
generates 
the 
poem 
out 
of 
itself, 
ever 
again: 
that 
is 
what 
the 
strophic 
form 
of 
the 
folk 
song 
signifies; 
a 
phenomenon 
which 
I 
had 
always 
beheld 
with 
astonishment, 
until 
at 
last 
I 
found 
this 
explanation. 
Anyone 
who 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
theory 
examines 
a 
collection 
of 
folk 
songs, 
such 
as 
Des 
Knaben 
Wunderhorn,1 
will 
find 
innumerable 
instances 
of 
the 
way 
the 
continuously 
generating 
melody 
scatters 
image 
sparks 
all 
around, 
which 
in 
their 
variegation, 
their 
abrupt 
change, 
their 
mad 
precipitation, 
manifest 
a 
power 
quite 
unknown 
to 
the 
epic 
and 
its 
steady 
flow. 
From 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
epos, 
this 
unequal 
and 
irregular 
image 
world 
of 
lyrical 
poetry 
is 
simply 
to 
be 
condemned: 
and 
it 
certainly 
has 
been 
thus 
condemned 
by 
the 
solemn 
epic 
rhapsodists 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
festivals 
in 
the 
age 
of 
Terpander.2 


Accordingly, 
we 
observe 
that 
in 
the 
poetry 
of 
the 
folk 
song, 
language 
is 
strained 
to 
its 
utmost 
that 
it 
may 
imitate 
music; 
and 
with 
Archilochus 
begins 



a 
new 
world 
of 
poetry, 
basically 
opposed 
to 
the 
Homeric. 
And 
in 
saying 
this 
we 
have 
indicated 
the 
only 
possible 
relation 
between 
poetry 
and 
music, 
between 
word 
and 
tone: 
the 
word, 
the 
image, 
the 
concept 
here 
seeks 
an 
expression 
analogous 
to 
music 
and 
now 
feels 
in 
itself 
the 
power 
of 
music. 
In 
this 
sense 
we 
may 
discriminate 
between 
two 
main 
currents 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
language 
of 
the 
Greek 
people, 
according 
to 
whether 
their 
language 
imitated 
the 
world 
of 
image 
and 
phenomenon 
or 
the 
world 
of 
music. 
One 
need 
only 
reflect 
more 
deeply 
on 
the 
linguistic 
difference 
with 
regard 
to 
color, 
syntactical 
structure, 
and 
vocabulary 
in 
Homer 
and 
Pindar, 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
significance 
of 
this 
contrast; 
indeed, 
it 
becomes 
palpably 
clear 
that 
in 
the 
period 
between 
Homer 
and 
Pindar 
the 
orgiastic 
flute 
tones 
of 
Olympus 
must 
have 
been 
sounded, 
which, 
even 
in 
Aristotle’s 
time, 
when 
music 
was 
infinitely 
more 
developed, 
transported 
people 
to 
drunken 
ecstasy, 
and 
which, 
in 
their 
primitive 
state 
of 
development, 
undoubtedly 
incited 
to 
imitation 
all 
the 
poetic 
means 
of 
expression 
of 
contemporaneous 
man. 


I 
here 
call 
attention 
to 
a 
familiar 
phenomenon 
of 
our 
own 
times, 
against 
which 
our 
aesthetic 
raises 
many 
objections. 
Again 
and 
again 
we 
have 
occasion 
to 
observe 
that 
a 
Beethoven 
symphony 
compels 
its 
individual 
auditors 
to 
use 
figurative 
speech 
in 
describing 
it, 
no 
matter 
how 
fantastically 
variegated 
and 
even 
contradictory 
may 
be 
the 
composition 
and 
make-up 
of 
the 
different 
worlds 
of 
images 
produced 
by 
a 
piece 
of 
music. 
To 
exercise 
its 
poor 
wit 
on 
such 
compositions, 
and 
to 
overlook 
a 
phenomenon 
which 
is 
certainly 
worth 
explaining, 
are 
quite 
in 
keeping 
with 
this 
aesthetic. 
Indeed, 
even 
when 
the 
tone-poet 
expresses 
his 
composition 
in 
images, 
when 
for 
instance 
he 
designates 
a 
certain 
symphony 
as 
the 
“pastoral” 
symphony, 
or 
a 
passage 
in 
it 
as 
the 
“scene 
by 
the 
brook,” 
or 
another 
as 
the 
“merry 
gathering 
of 
rustics,” 
these 
two 
are 
only 
symbolical 
representations 
born 
of 
music—and 
not 
the 
imitated 
objects 
of 
music—representations 
which 
can 
teach 
us 
nothing 
whatsoever 
concerning 
the 
Dionysian 
content 
of 
music, 
and 
which 
indeed 
have 
no 
distinctive 
value 
of 
their 
own 
beside 
other 
images. 
We 
have 
now 
to 
transfer 
this 
process 
of 
a 
discharge 
of 
music 
in 
images 
to 
some 
fresh, 
youthful, 
linguistically 
creative 
people, 
in 
order 
to 
get 
some 
notion 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
strophic 
folk 
song 
originates, 
and 
the 
whole 
linguistic 
capacity 
is 
excited 
by 
this 
new 
principle 
of 
the 
imitation 
of 
music. 


If, 
therefore, 
we 
may 
regard 
lyric 
poetry 
as 
the 
imitative 
fulguration 
of 
music 
in 
images 
and 
concepts, 
we 
should 
now 
ask: 
“As 
what 
does 
music 
appear 
in 
the 
mirror 
of 
images 
and 
concepts?” 
It 
appears 
as 
will, 
taking 
the 



term 
in 
Schopenhauer’s 
sense, 
i.e., 
as 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
aesthetic, 
purely 
contemplative, 
and 
passive 
frame 
of 
mind. 
Here, 
however, 
we 
must 
make 
as 
sharp 
a 
distinction 
as 
possible 
between 
the 
concepts 
of 
essence 
and 
phenomenon; 
for 
music, 
according 
to 
its 
essence, 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
will. 
To 
be 
will 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be 
wholly 
banished 
from 
the 
realm 
of 
art—for 
the 
will 
is 
the 
unaesthetic-in-itself; 
but 
it 
appears 
as 
will. 
For 
in 
order 
to 
express 
its 
appearance 
in 
images, 
the 
lyrist 
needs 
all 
the 
agitations 
of 
passion, 
from 
the 
whisper 
of 
mere 
inclination 
to 
the 
roar 
of 
madness. 
Impelled 
to 
speak 
of 
music 
in 
Apollinian 
symbols, 
he 
conceives 
of 
all 
nature, 
and 
himself 
in 
it, 
as 
willing, 
as 
desiring, 
as 
eternal 
longing. 
But 
insofar 
as 
he 
interprets 
music 
by 
means 
of 
images, 
he 
himself 
rests 
in 
the 
calm 
sea 
of 
Apollinian 
contemplation, 
though 
everything 
around 
him 
that 
he 
beholds 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
music 
is 
in 
urgent 
and 
active 
motion. 
Indeed, 
when 
he 
beholds 
himself 
through 
this 
same 
medium, 
his 
own 
image 
appears 
to 
him 
as 
an 
unsatisfied 
feeling: 
his 
own 
willing, 
longing, 
moaning, 
rejoicing, 
are 
to 
him 
symbols 
by 
which 
he 
interprets 
music. 
This 
is 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
lyrist: 
as 
Apollinian 
genius 
he 
interprets 
music 
through 
the 
image 
of 
the 
will, 
while 
he 
himself, 
completely 
released 
from 
the 
greed 
of 
the 
will, 
is 
the 
pure, 
undimmed 
eye 
of 
the 
sun. 


Our 
whole 
discussion 
insists 
that 
lyric 
poetry 
is 
dependent 
on 
the 
spirit 
of 
music 
just 
as 
music 
itself 
in 
its 
absolute 
sovereignty 
does 
not 
need 
the 
image 
and 
the 
concept, 
but 
merely 
endures 
them 
as 
accompaniments. 
The 
poems 
of 
the 
lyrist 
can 
express 
nothing 
that 
did 
not 
already 
lie 
hidden 
in 
that 
vast 
universality 
and 
absoluteness 
in 
the 
music 
that 
compelled 
him 
to 
figurative 
speech. 
Language 
can 
never 
adequately 
render 
the 
cosmic 
symbolism 
of 
music, 
because 
music 
stands 
in 
symbolic 
relation 
to 
the 
primordial 
contradiction 
and 
primordial 
pain 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
primal 
unity, 
and 
therefore 
symbolizes 
a 
sphere 
which 
is 
beyond 
and 
prior 
to 
all 
phenomena. 
Rather, 
all 
phenomena, 
compared 
with 
it, 
are 
merely 
symbols: 
hence 
language, 
as 
the 
organ 
and 
symbol 
of 
phenomena, 
can 
never 
by 
any 
means 
disclose 
the 
innermost 
heart 
of 
music; 
language, 
in 
its 
attempt 
to 
imitate 
it, 
can 
only 
be 
in 
superficial 
contact 
with 
music; 
while 
all 
the 
eloquence 
of 
lyric 
poetry 
cannot 
bring 
the 
deepest 
significance 
of 
the 
latter 
one 
step 
nearer 
to 
us. 



7 


We 
must 
now 
avail 
ourselves 
of 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
art 
considered 
so 
far, 
in 
order 
to 
find 
our 
way 
through 
the 
labyrinth, 
as 
we 
must 
call 
it, 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
Greek 
tragedy. 
I 
do 
not 
think 
I 
am 
unreasonable 
in 
saying 
that 
the 
problem 
of 
this 
origin 
has 
as 
yet 
not 
even 
been 
seriously 
posed, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
solved, 
however 
often 
the 
ragged 
tatters 
of 
ancient 
tradition 
have 
been 
sewn 
together 
in 
various 
combinations 
and 
torn 
apart 
again. 
This 
tradition 
tells 
us 
quite 
unequivocally 
that 
tragedy 
arose 
from 
the 
tragic 
chorus, 
and 
was 
originally 
only 
chorus 
and 
nothing 
but 
chorus. 
Hence 
we 
consider 
it 
our 
duty 
to 
look 
into 
the 
heart 
of 
this 
tragic 
chorus 
as 
the 
real 
proto-drama, 
without 
resting 
satisfied 
with 
such 
arty 
clichés 
as 
that 
the 
chorus 
is 
the 
“ideal 
spectator” 
or 
that 
it 
represents 
the 
people 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
aristocratic 
region 
of 
the 
scene. 
This 
latter 
explanation 
has 
a 
sublime 
sound 
to 
many 
a 
politician 
—as 
if 
the 
immutable 
moral 
law 
had 
been 
embodied 
by 
the 
democratic 
Athenians 
in 
the 
popular 
chorus, 
which 
always 
won 
out 
over 
the 
passionate 
excesses 
and 
extravagances 
of 
kings. 
This 
theory 
may 
be 
ever 
so 
forcibly 
suggested 
by 
one 
of 
Aristotle’s 
observations; 
still, 
it 
has 
no 
influence 
on 
the 
original 
formation 
of 
tragedy, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
whole 
opposition 
of 
prince 
and 
people—indeed 
the 
whole 
politico-social 
sphere—was 
excluded 
from 
the 
purely 
religious 
origins 
of 
tragedy. 
But 
even 
regarding 
the 
classical 
form 
of 
the 
chorus 
in 
Aeschylus 
and 
Sophocles, 
which 
is 
known 
to 
us, 
we 
should 
deem 
it 
blasphemy 
to 
speak 
here 
of 
intimations 
of 
“constitutional 
popular 
representation.” 
From 
this 
blasphemy, 
however, 
others 
have 
not 
shrunk. 
Ancient 
constitutions 
knew 
of 
no 
constitutional 
representation 
of 
the 
people 
in 
praxi, 
and 
it 
is 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
they 
did 
not 
even 
“have 
intimations” 
of 
it 
in 
tragedy. 


Much 
more 
famous 
than 
this 
political 
interpretation 
of 
the 
chorus 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
A. 
W. 
Schlegel,1 
who 
advises 
us 
to 
regard 
the 
chorus 
somehow 
as 
the 
essence 
and 
extract 
of 
the 
crowd 
of 
spectators—as 
the 
“ideal 
spectator.” 
This 
view, 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
historical 
tradition 
that 
originally 
tragedy 
was 
only 
chorus, 
reveals 
itself 
for 
what 
it 
is—a 
crude, 
unscientific, 
yet 
brilliant 
claim 
that 
owes 
its 
brilliancy 
only 
to 
its 
concentrated 
form 
of 
expression, 
to 



the 
typically 
Germanic 
bias 
in 
favor 
of 
anything 
called 
“ideal,” 
and 
to 
our 
momentary 
astonishment. 
For 
we 
are 
certainly 
astonished 
the 
moment 
we 
compare 
our 
familiar 
theatrical 
public 
with 
this 
chorus, 
and 
ask 
ourselves 
whether 
it 
could 
ever 
be 
possible 
to 
idealize 
from 
such 
a 
public 
something 
analogous 
to 
the 
Greek 
tragic 
chorus. 
We 
tacitly 
deny 
this, 
and 
now 
wonder 
as 
much 
at 
the 
boldness 
of 
Schlegel’s 
claim 
as 
at 
the 
totally 
different 
nature 
of 
the 
Greek 
public. 
For 
we 
had 
always 
believed 
that 
the 
right 
spectator, 
whoever 
he 
might 
be, 
must 
always 
remain 
conscious 
that 
he 
was 
viewing 
a 
work 
of 
art 
and 
not 
an 
empirical 
reality. 
But 
the 
tragic 
chorus 
of 
the 
Greeks 
is 
forced 
to 
recognize 
real 
beings 
in 
the 
figures 
on 
the 
stage. 
The 
chorus 
of 
the 
Oceanides 
really 
believes 
that 
it 
sees 
before 
it 
the 
Titan 
Prometheus, 
and 
it 
considers 
itself 
as 
real 
as 
the 
god 
of 
the 
scene. 
But 
could 
the 
highest 
and 
purest 
type 
of 
spectator 
regard 
Prometheus 
as 
bodily 
present 
and 
real, 
as 
the 
Oceanides 
do? 
Is 
it 
characteristic 
of 
the 
ideal 
spectator 
to 
run 
onto 
the 
stage 
and 
free 
the 
god 
from 
his 
torments? 
We 
had 
always 
believed 
in 
an 
aesthetic 
public 
and 
considered 
the 
individual 
spectator 
the 
better 
qualified 
the 
more 
he 
was 
capable 
of 
viewing 
a 
work 
of 
art 
as 
art, 
that 
is, 
aesthetically. 
But 
now 
Schlegel 
tells 
us 
that 
the 
perfect, 
ideal 
spectator 
does 
not 
at 
all 
allow 
the 
world 
of 
the 
drama 
to 
act 
on 
him 
aesthetically, 
but 
corporally 
and 
empirically. 
Oh, 
these 
Greeks! 
we 
sigh; 
they 
upset 
all 
our 
aesthetics! 
But 
once 
accustomed 
to 
this, 
we 
repeated 
Schlegel’s 
saying 
whenever 
the 
chorus 
came 
up 
for 
discussion. 


Now 
the 
tradition, 
which 
is 
quite 
explicit, 
speaks 
against 
Schlegel. 
The 
chorus 
as 
such, 
without 
the 
stage—the 
primitive 
form 
of 
tragedy—and 
the 
chorus 
of 
ideal 
spectators 
do 
not 
go 
together. 
What 
kind 
of 
artistic 
genre 
could 
possibly 
be 
extracted 
from 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
spectator, 
and 
find 
its 
true 
form 
in 
the 
“spectator 
as 
such”? 
The 
spectator 
without 
the 
spectacle 
is 
an 
absurd 
notion. 
We 
fear 
that 
the 
birth 
of 
tragedy 
is 
to 
be 
explained 
neither 
by 
any 
high 
esteem 
for 
the 
moral 
intelligence 
of 
the 
masses 
nor 
by 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
spectator 
without 
a 
spectacle; 
and 
we 
consider 
the 
problem 
too 
deep 
to 
be 
even 
touched 
by 
such 
superficial 
considerations. 


An 
infinitely 
more 
valuable 
insight 
into 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
chorus 
was 
displayed 
by 
Schiller 
in 
the 
celebrated 
Preface 
to 
his 
Bride 
of 
Messina, 
where 
he 
regards 
the 
chorus 
as 
a 
living 
wall 
that 
tragedy 
constructs 
around 
itself 
in 
order 
to 
close 
itself 
off 
from 
the 
world 
of 
reality 
and 
to 
preserve 
its 
ideal 
domain 
and 
its 
poetical 
freedom. 


With 
this, 
his 
chief 
weapon, 
Schiller 
combats 
the 
ordinary 
conception 
of 



the 
natural, 
the 
illusion 
usually 
demanded 
in 
dramatic 
poetry. 
Although 
the 
stage 
day 
is 
merely 
artificial, 
the 
architecture 
only 
symbolical, 
and 
the 
metrical 
language 
ideal 
in 
character, 
nevertheless 
an 
erroneous 
view 
still 
prevails 
in 
the 
main, 
as 
he 
points 
out: 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
that 
one 
merely 
tolerates 
as 
poetic 
license 
what 
is 
actually 
the 
essence 
of 
all 
poetry. 
The 
introduction 
of 
the 
chorus, 
says 
Schiller, 
is 
the 
decisive 
step 
by 
which 
war 
is 
declared 
openly 
and 
honorably 
against 
all 
naturalism 
in 
art. 


It 
would 
seem 
that 
to 
denigrate 
this 
view 
of 
the 
matter 
our 
would-be 
superior 
age 
has 
coined 
the 
disdainful 
catchword 
“pseudo-idealism.” 
I 
fear, 
however, 
that 
we, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
with 
our 
present 
adoration 
of 
the 
natural 
and 
the 
real, 
have 
reached 
the 
opposite 
pole 
of 
all 
idealism, 
namely, 
the 
region 
of 
wax-work 
cabinets. 
There 
is 
an 
art 
in 
these, 
too, 
as 
there 
is 
in 
certain 
novels 
much 
in 
vogue 
at 
present; 
but 
we 
really 
should 
not 
be 
plagued 
with 
the 
claim 
that 
such 
art 
has 
overcome 
the 
“pseudo-idealism” 
of 
Goethe 
and 
Schiller. 


It 
is 
indeed 
an 
“ideal” 
domain, 
as 
Schiller 
correctly 
perceived, 
in 
which 
the 
Greek 
satyr 
chorus, 
the 
chorus 
of 
primitive 
tragedy, 
was 
wont 
to 
dwell. 
It 
is 
a 
domain 
raised 
high 
above 
the 
actual 
paths 
of 
mortals. 
For 
this 
chorus 
the 
Greek 
built 
up 
the 
scaffolding 
of 
a 
fictitious 
natural 
state 
and 
on 
it 
placed 
fictitious 
natural 
beings. 
On 
this 
foundation 
tragedy 
developed 
and 
so, 
of 
course, 
it 
could 
dispense 
from 
the 
beginning 
with 
a 
painstaking 
portrayal 
of 
reality. 
Yet 
it 
is 
no 
arbitrary 
world 
placed 
by 
whim 
between 
heaven 
and 
earth; 
rather 
it 
is 
a 
world 
with 
the 
same 
reality 
and 
credibility 
that 
Olympus 
with 
its 
inhabitants 
possessed 
for 
the 
believing 
Hellene. 
The 
satyr, 
as 
the 
Dionysian 
chorist, 
lives 
in 
a 
religiously 
acknowledged 
reality 
under 
the 
sanction 
of 
myth 
and 
cult. 
That 
tragedy 
should 
begin 
with 
him, 
that 
he 
should 
be 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
wisdom 
of 
tragedy, 
is 
just 
as 
strange 
a 
phenomenon 
for 
us 
as 
the 
general 
derivation 
of 
tragedy 
from 
the 
chorus. 


Perhaps 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
point 
of 
departure 
for 
our 
inquiry 
if 
I 
put 
forward 
the 
proposition 
that 
the 
satyr, 
the 
fictitious 
natural 
being, 
bears 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
the 
man 
of 
culture 
that 
Dionysian 
music 
bears 
to 
civilization. 
Concerning 
the 
latter, 
Richard 
Wagner 
says 
that 
it 
is 
nullified2 
by 
music 
just 
as 
lamplight 
is 
nullified 
by 
the 
light 
of 
day. 
Similarly, 
I 
believe, 
the 
Greek 
man 
of 
culture 
felt 
himself 
nullified 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
satyric 
chorus; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
most 
immediate 
effect 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
tragedy, 
that 
the 
state 
and 
society 
and, 
quite 
generally, 
the 
gulfs 
between 
man 
and 
man 
give 
way 
to 
an 
overwhelming 
feeling 
of 
unity 
leading 
back 
to 
the 
very 
heart 
of 
nature. 
The 



metaphysical 
comfort—with 
which, 
I 
am 
suggesting 
even 
now, 
every 
true 
tragedy 
leaves 
us—that 
life 
is 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
things, 
despite 
all 
the 
changes 
of 
appearances, 
indestructibly 
powerful 
and 
pleasurable—this 
comfort 
appears 
in 
incarnate 
clarity 
in 
the 
chorus 
of 
satyrs, 
a 
chorus 
of 
natural 
beings 
who 
live 
ineradicably, 
as 
it 
were, 
behind 
all 
civilization 
and 
remain 
eternally 
the 
same, 
despite 
the 
changes 
of 
generations 
and 
of 
the 
history 
of 
nations. 


With 
this 
chorus 
the 
profound 
Hellene, 
uniquely 
susceptible 
to 
the 
tenderest 
and 
deepest 
suffering, 
comforts 
himself, 
having 
looked 
boldly 
right 
into 
the 
terrible 
destructiveness 
of 
so-called 
world 
history 
as 
well 
as 
the 
cruelty 
of 
nature, 
and 
being 
in 
danger 
of 
longing 
for 
a 
Buddhistic 
negation 
of 
the 
will.3 
Art 
saves 
him, 
and 
through 
art—life. 


For 
the 
rapture 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
state 
with 
its 
annihilation 
of 
the 
ordinary 
bounds 
and 
limits 
of 
existence 
contains, 
while 
it 
lasts, 
a 
lethargic 
element 
in 
which 
all 
personal 
experiences 
of 
the 
past 
become 
immersed. 
This 
chasm 
of 
oblivion 
separates 
the 
worlds 
of 
everyday 
reality 
and 
of 
Dionysian 
reality. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
everyday 
reality 
re-enters 
consciousness, 
it 
is 
experienced 
as 
such, 
with 
nausea: 
an 
ascetic, 
will-negating 
mood 
is 
the 
fruit 
of 
these 
states. 


In 
this 
sense 
the 
Dionysian 
man 
resembles 
Hamlet: 
both 
have 
once 
looked 
truly 
into 
the 
essence 
of 
things, 
they 
have 
gained 
knowledge, 
and 
nausea 
inhibits 
action; 
for 
their 
action 
could 
not 
change 
anything 
in 
the 
eternal 
nature 
of 
things; 
they 
feel 
it 
to 
be 
ridiculous 
or 
humiliating 
that 
they 
should 
be 
asked 
to 
set 
right 
a 
world 
that 
is 
out 
of 
joint. 
Knowledge 
kills 
action; 
action 
requires 
the 
veils 
of 
illusion: 
that 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Hamlet, 
not 
that 
cheap 
wisdom 
of 
Jack 
the 
Dreamer 
who 
reflects 
too 
much 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
from 
an 
excess 
of 
possibilities 
does 
not 
get 
around 
to 
action. 
Not 
reflection, 
no—true 
knowledge, 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
horrible 
truth, 
outweighs 
any 
motive 
for 
action, 
both 
in 
Hamlet 
and 
in 
the 
Dionysian 
man. 


Now 
no 
comfort 
avails 
any 
more; 
longing 
transcends 
a 
world 
after 
death, 
even 
the 
gods; 
existence 
is 
negated 
along 
with 
its 
glittering 
reflection 
in 
the 
gods 
or 
in 
an 
immortal 
beyond. 
Conscious 
of 
the 
truth 
he 
has 
once 
seen, 
man 
now 
sees 
everywhere 
only 
the 
horror 
or 
absurdity 
of 
existence; 
now 
he 
understands 
what 
is 
symbolic 
in 
Ophelia’s 
fate; 
now 
he 
understands 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
sylvan 
god, 
Silenus; 
he 
is 
nauseated. 


Here, 
when 
the 
danger 
to 
his 
will 
is 
greatest, 
art 
approaches 
as 
a 
saving 
sorceress, 
expert 
at 
healing. 
She 
alone 
knows 
how 
to 
turn 
these 
nauseous 
thoughts 
about 
the 
horror 
or 
absurdity 
of 
existence 
into 
notions 
with 
which 



one 
can 
live: 
these 
are 
the 
sublime 
as 
the 
artistic 
taming 
of 
the 
horrible, 
and 
the 
comic 
as 
the 
artistic 
discharge 
of 
the 
nausea 
of 
absurdity. 
The 
satyr 
chorus 
of 
the 
dithyramb 
is 
the 
saving 
deed 
of 
Greek 
art; 
faced 
with 
the 
intermediary 
world 
of 
these 
Dionysian 
companions, 
the 
feelings 
described 
here 
exhausted 
themselves.4

The 
satyr, 
like 
the 
idyllic 
shepherd 
of 
more 
recent 
times, 
is 
the 
offspring 
of 
a 
longing 
for 
the 
primitive 
and 
the 
natural; 
but 
how 
firmly 
and 
fearlessly 
the 
Greek 
embraced 
the 
man 
of 
the 
woods, 
and 
how 
timorously 
and 
mawkishly 
modern 
man 
dallied 
with 
the 
flattering 
image 
of 
a 
sentimental, 
flute-playing, 
tender 
shepherd! 
Nature, 
as 
yet 
unchanged 
by 
knowledge, 
with 
the 
bolts 
of 
culture 
still 
unbroken—that 
is 
what 
the 
Greek 
saw 
in 
his 
satyr 
who 
nevertheless 
was 
not 
a 
mere 
ape. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
satyr 
was 
the 
archetype 
of 
man, 
the 
embodiment 
of 
his 
highest 
and 
most 
intense 
emotions, 
the 
ecstatic 
reveler 
enraptured 
by 
the 
proximity 
of 
his 
god, 
the 
sympathetic 
companion 
in 
whom 
the 
suffering 
of 
the 
god 
is 
repeated, 
one 
who 
proclaims 
wisdom 
from 
the 
very 
heart 
of 
nature, 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
sexual 
omnipotence 
of 
nature 
which 
the 
Greeks 
used 
to 
contemplate 
with 
reverent 
wonder. 


The 
satyr 
was 
something 
sublime 
and 
divine: 
thus 
he 
had 
to 
appear 
to 
the 
painfully 
broken 
vision 
of 
Dionysian 
man. 
The 
contrived 
shepherd 
in 
his 
dress-ups 
would 
have 
offended 
him: 
on 
the 
unconcealed 
and 
vigorously 
magnificent 
characters 
of 
nature, 
his 
eye 
rested 
with 
sublime 
satisfaction; 
here 
the 
true 
human 
being 
was 
disclosed, 
the 
bearded 
satyr 
jubilating 
to 
his 
god. 
Confronted 
with 
him, 
the 
man 
of 
culture 
shriveled 
into 
a 
mendacious 
caricature. 


Schiller 
is 
right 
about 
these 
origins 
of 
tragic 
art, 
too: 
the 
chorus 
is 
a 
living 
wall 
against 
the 
assaults 
of 
reality 
because 
it—the 
satyr 
chorus—represents 
existence 
more 
truthfully, 
really, 
and 
completely 
than 
the 
man 
of 
culture 
does 
who 
ordinarily 
considers 
himself 
as 
the 
only 
reality. 
The 
sphere 
of 
poetry 
does 
not 
lie 
outside 
the 
world 
as 
a 
fantastic 
impossibility 
spawned 
by 
a 
poet’s 
brain: 
it 
desires 
to 
be 
just 
the 
opposite, 
the 
unvarnished 
expression 
of 
the 
truth, 
and 
must 
precisely 
for 
that 
reason 
discard 
the 
mendacious 
finery 
of 
that 
alleged 
reality 
of 
the 
man 
of 
culture. 


The 
contrast 
between 
this 
real 
truth 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
lie 
of 
culture 
that 
poses 
as 
if 
it 
were 
the 
only 
reality 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
between 
the 
eternal 
core 
of 
things, 
the 
thing-in-itself, 
and 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
appearances:1 
just 
as 
tragedy, 
with 
its 
metaphysical 
comfort, 
points 
to 
the 
eternal 
life 
of 
this 
core 



of 
existence 
which 
abides 
through 
the 
perpetual 
destruction 
of 
appearances, 
the 
symbolism 
of 
the 
satyr 
chorus 
proclaims 
this 
primordial 
relationship 
between 
the 
thing-in-itself 
and 
appearance.2 
The 
idyllic 
shepherd 
of 
modern 
man 
is 
merely 
a 
counterfeit 
of 
the 
sum 
of 
cultural 
illusions 
that 
are 
allegedly 
nature; 
the 
Dionysian 
Greek 
wants 
truth 
and 
nature 
in 
their 
most 
forceful 
form—and 
sees 
himself 
changed, 
as 
by 
magic, 
into 
a 
satyr. 


The 
reveling 
throng, 
the 
votaries 
of 
Dionysus 
jubilate 
under 
the 
spell 
of 
such 
moods 
and 
insights 
whose 
power 
transforms 
them 
before 
their 
own 
eyes 
till 
they 
imagine 
that 
they 
are 
beholding 
themselves 
as 
restored 
geniuses 
of 
nature, 
as 
satyrs. 
The 
later 
constitution 
of 
the 
chorus 
in 
tragedy 
is 
the 
artistic 
imitation 
of 
this 
natural 
phenomenon, 
though, 
to 
be 
sure, 
at 
this 
point 
the 
separation 
of 
Dionysian 
spectators 
and 
magically 
enchanted 
Dionysians 
became 
necessary. 
Only 
we 
must 
always 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
public 
at 
an 
Attic 
tragedy 
found 
itself 
in 
the 
chorus 
of 
the 
orchestra,3 
and 
there 
was 
at 
bottom 
no 
opposition 
between 
public 
and 
chorus: 
everything 
is 
merely 
a 
great 
sublime 
chorus 
of 
dancing 
and 
singing 
satyrs 
or 
of 
those 
who 
permit 
themselves 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
such 
satyrs. 


Now 
we 
are 
ready 
to 
understand 
Schlegel’s 
formulation 
in 
a 
deeper 
sense. 
The 
chorus 
is 
the 
“ideal 
spectator”4 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
the 
only 
beholder, 
the 
beholder 
of 
the 
visionary 
world 
of 
the 
scene.5 
A 
public 
of 
spectators 
as 
we 
know 
it 
was 
unknown 
to 
the 
Greeks: 
in 
their 
theaters 
the 
terraced 
structure 
of 
concentric 
arcs 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
everybody 
to 
actually 
overlook6 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
culture 
around 
him 
and 
to 
imagine, 
in 
absorbed 
contemplation, 
that 
he 
himself 
was 
a 
chorist. 


In 
the 
light 
of 
this 
insight 
we 
may 
call 
the 
chorus 
in 
its 
primitive 
form, 
in 
proto-tragedy, 
the 
mirror 
image 
in 
which 
the 
Dionysian 
man 
contemplates 
himself. 
This 
phenomenon 
is 
best 
made 
clear 
by 
imagining 
an 
actor 
who, 
being 
truly 
talented, 
sees 
the 
role 
he 
is 
supposed 
to 
play 
quite 
palpably 
before 
his 
eyes. 
The 
satyr 
chorus 
is, 
first 
of 
all, 
a 
vision 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
mass 
of 
spectators, 
just 
as 
the 
world 
of 
the 
stage, 
in 
turn, 
is 
a 
vision 
of 
this 
satyr 
chorus: 
the 
force 
of 
this 
vision 
is 
strong 
enough 
to 
make 
the 
eye 
insensitive 
and 
blind 
to 
the 
impression 
of 
“reality,” 
to 
the 
men 
of 
culture 
who 
occupy 
the 
rows 
of 
seats 
all 
around. 
The 
form 
of 
the 
Greek 
theater 
recalls 
a 
lonely 
valley 
in 
the 
mountains: 
the 
architecture 
of 
the 
scene 
appears 
like 
a 
luminous 
cloud 
formation 
that 
the 
Bacchants 
swarming 
over 
the 
mountains 
behold 
from 
a 
height—like 
the 
splendid 
frame 
in 
which 
the 
image 
of 
Dionysus 
is 
revealed 
to 
them. 



In 
the 
face 
of 
our 
learned 
views 
about 
elementary 
artistic 
processes, 
this 
artistic 
proto-phenomenon 
which 
we 
bring 
up 
here 
to 
help 
explain 
the 
tragic 
chorus 
is 
almost 
offensive, 
although 
nothing 
could 
be 
more 
certain 
than 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
poet 
is 
a 
poet 
only 
insofar 
as 
he 
sees 
himself 
surrounded 
by 
figures 
who 
live 
and 
act 
before 
him 
and 
into 
whose 
inmost 
nature 
he 
can 
see. 
Owing 
to 
a 
peculiar 
modern 
weakness, 
we 
are 
inclined 
to 
imagine 
the 
aesthetic 
proto-phenomenon 
in 
a 
manner 
much 
too 
complicated 
and 
abstract. 


For 
a 
genuine 
poet, 
metaphor 
is 
not 
a 
rhetorical 
figure 
but 
a 
vicarious 
image 
that 
he 
actually 
beholds 
in 
place 
of 
a 
concept. 
A 
character 
is 
for 
him 
not 
a 
whole 
he 
has 
composed 
out 
of 
particular 
traits, 
picked 
up 
here 
and 
there, 
but 
an 
obtrusively 
alive 
person 
before 
his 
very 
eyes, 
distinguished 
from 
the 
otherwise 
identical 
vision 
of 
a 
painter 
only 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
continually 
goes 
on 
living 
and 
acting. 
How 
is 
it 
that 
Homer’s 
descriptions 
are 
so 
much 
more 
vivid 
than 
those 
of 
any 
other 
poet? 
Because 
he 
visualizes 
so 
much 
more 
vividly. 
We 
talk 
so 
abstractly 
about 
poetry 
because 
all 
of 
us 
are 
usually 
bad 
poets. 
At 
bottom, 
the 
aesthetic 
phenomenon 
is 
simple: 
let 
anyone 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
behold 
continually 
a 
vivid 
play 
and 
to 
live 
constantly 
surrounded 
by 
hosts 
of 
spirits, 
and 
he 
will 
be 
a 
poet; 
let 
anyone 
feel 
the 
urge 
to 
transform 
himself 
and 
to 
speak 
out 
of 
other 
bodies 
and 
souls, 
and 
he 
will 
be 
a 
dramatist. 


The 
Dionysian 
excitement 
is 
capable 
of 
communicating 
this 
artistic 
gift 
to 
a 
multitude, 
so 
they 
can 
see 
themselves 
surrounded 
by 
such 
a 
host 
of 
spirits 
while 
knowing 
themselves 
to 
be 
essentially 
one 
with 
them. 
This 
process 
of 
the 
tragic 
chorus 
is 
the 
dramatic 
proto-phenomenon: 
to 
see 
oneself 
transformed 
before 
one’s 
own 
eyes 
and 
to 
begin 
to 
act 
as 
if 
one 
had 
actually 
entered 
into 
another 
body, 
another 
character. 
This 
process 
stands 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
drama. 
Here 
we 
have 
something 
different 
from 
the 
rhapsodist 
who 
does 
not 
become 
fused 
with 
his 
images 
but, 
like 
a 
painter, 
sees 
them 
outside 
himself 
as 
objects 
of 
contemplation. 
Here 
we 
have 
a 
surrender 
of 
individuality 
and 
a 
way 
of 
entering 
into 
another 
character. 
And 
this 
phenomenon 
is 
encountered 
epidemically: 
a 
whole 
throng 
experiences 
the 
magic 
of 
this 
transformation. 


The 
dithyramb 
is 
thus 
essentially 
different 
from 
all 
other 
choral 
odes. 
The 
virgins 
who 
proceed 
solemnly 
to 
the 
temple 
of 
Apollo, 
laurel 
branches 
in 
their 
hands, 
singing 
a 
processional 
hymn, 
remain 
what 
they 
are 
and 
retain 
their 
civic 
names: 
the 
dithyrambic 
chorus 
is 
a 
chorus 
of 
transformed 
characters 
whose 
civic 
past 
and 
social 
status 
have 
been 
totally 
forgotten: 
they 
have 
become 
timeless 
servants 
of 
their 
god 
who 
live 
outside 
the 
spheres 
of 



society. 
All 
the 
other 
choral 
lyric 
poetry 
of 
the 
Hellenes 
is 
merely 
a 
tremendous 
intensification 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
solo 
singer, 
while 
in 
the 
dithyramb 
we 
confront 
a 
community 
of 
unconscious 
actors 
who 
consider 
themselves 
and 
one 
another 
transformed. 


Such 
magic 
transformation 
is 
the 
presupposition 
of 
all 
dramatic 
art. 
In 
this 
magic 
transformation 
the 
Dionysian 
reveler 
sees 
himself 
as 
a 
satyr, 
and 
as 
a 
satyr, 
in 
turn, 
he 
sees 
the 
god, 
which 
means 
that 
in 
his 
metamorphosis 
he 
beholds 
another 
vision 
outside 
himself, 
as 
the 
Apollinian 
complement 
of 
his 
own 
state. 
With 
this 
new 
vision 
the 
drama 
is 
complete. 


In 
the 
light 
of 
this 
insight 
we 
must 
understand 
Greek 
tragedy 
as 
the 
Dionysian 
chorus 
which 
ever 
anew 
discharges 
itself 
in 
an 
Apollinian 
world 
of 
images. 
Thus 
the 
choral 
parts 
with 
which 
tragedy 
is 
interlaced 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
womb 
that 
gave 
birth 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
so-called 
dialogue, 
that 
is, 
the 
entire 
world 
of 
the 
stage, 
the 
real 
drama. 
In 
several 
successive 
discharges 
this 
primal 
ground 
of 
tragedy 
radiates 
this 
vision 
of 
the 
drama 
which 
is 
by 
all 
means 
a 
dream 
apparition 
and 
to 
that 
extent 
epic 
in 
nature; 
but 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
being 
the 
objectification 
of 
a 
Dionysian 
state, 
it 
represents 
not 
Apollinian 
redemption 
through 
mere 
appearance 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
shattering 
of 
the 
individual 
and 
his 
fusion 
with 
primal 
being. 
Thus 
the 
drama 
is 
the 
Dionysian 
embodiment 
of 
Dionysian 
insights 
and 
effects 
and 
thereby 
separated, 
as 
by 
a 
tremendous 
chasm, 
from 
the 
epic. 


The 
chorus 
of 
the 
Greek 
tragedy, 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
whole 
excited 
Dionysian 
throng, 
is 
thus 
fully 
explained 
by 
our 
conception. 
Accustomed 
as 
we 
are 
to 
the 
function 
of 
our 
modern 
stage 
chorus, 
especially 
in 
operas, 
we 
could 
not 
comprehend 
why 
the 
tragic 
chorus 
of 
the 
Greeks 
should 
be 
older, 
more 
original 
and 
important 
than 
the 
“action” 
proper, 
as 
the 
voice 
of 
tradition 
claimed 
unmistakably. 
And 
with 
this 
traditional 
primacy 
and 
originality 
we 
could 
not 
reconcile 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
chorus 
consisted 
only 
of 
humble 
beings 
who 
served—indeed, 
initially 
only 
of 
goatlike 
satyrs. 
Finally, 
there 
remained 
the 
riddle 
of 
the 
orchestra 
in 
front 
of 
the 
scene. 
But 
now 
we 
realize 
that 
the 
scene, 
complete 
with 
the 
action, 
was 
basically 
and 
originally 
thought 
of 
merely 
as 
a 
vision; 
the 
chorus 
is 
the 
only 
“reality” 
and 
generates 
the 
vision, 
speaking 
of 
it 
with 
the 
entire 
symbolism 
of 
dance, 
tone, 
and 
words. 
In 
its 
vision 
this 
chorus 
beholds 
its 
lord 
and 
master 
Dionysus 
and 
is 
therefore 
eternally 
the 
serving 
chorus: 
it 
sees 
how 
the 
god 
suffers 
and 
glorifies 
himself 
and 
therefore 
does 
not 
itself 
act. 
But 
while 
its 
attitude 
toward 
the 
god 
is 
wholly 
one 
of 
service, 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
the 
highest, 
namely 
the 
Dionysian, 



expression 
of 
nature 
and 
therefore 
pronounces 
in 
its 
rapture, 
as 
nature 
does, 
oracles 
and 
wise 
sayings: 
sharing 
his 
suffering 
it 
also 
shares 
something 
of 
his 
wisdom 
and 
proclaims 
the 
truth 
from 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
world. 
That 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
fantastic 
and 
seemingly 
so 
offensive 
figure 
of 
the 
wise 
and 
rapturous 
satyr 
who 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
“the 
simple 
man” 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
god—the 
image 
of 
nature 
and 
its 
strongest 
urges, 
even 
their 
symbol, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
proclaimer 
of 
her 
wisdom 
and 
art—musician, 
poet, 
dancer, 
and 
seer 
of 
spirits 
in 
one 
person. 


Dionysus, 
the 
real 
stage 
hero 
and 
center 
of 
the 
vision, 
was, 
according 
both 
to 
this 
insight 
and 
to 
the 
tradition, 
not 
actually 
present 
at 
first, 
in 
the 
very 
oldest 
period 
of 
tragedy; 
he 
was 
merely 
imagined 
as 
present, 
which 
means 
that 
originally 
tragedy 
was 
only 
“chorus” 
and 
not 
yet 
“drama.” 
Later 
the 
attempt 
was 
made 
to 
show 
the 
god 
as 
real 
and 
to 
represent 
the 
visionary 
figure 
together 
with 
its 
transfiguring 
frame 
as 
something 
visible 
for 
every 
eye 
—and 
thus 
“drama” 
in 
the 
narrower 
sense 
began. 
Now 
the 
dithyrambic 
chorus 
was 
assigned 
the 
task 
of 
exciting 
the 
mood 
of 
the 
listeners 
to 
such 
a 
Dionysian 
degree 
that, 
when 
the 
tragic 
hero 
appeared 
on 
the 
stage, 
they 
did 
not 
see 
the 
awkwardly 
masked 
human 
being 
but 
rather 
a 
visionary 
figure, 
born 
as 
it 
were 
from 
their 
own 
rapture. 


Consider 
Admetus 
as 
he 
is 
brooding 
over 
the 
memory 
of 
his 
recently 
departed 
wife 
Alcestis, 
consuming 
himself 
in 
her 
spiritual 
contemplation, 
when 
suddenly 
a 
similarly 
formed, 
similarly 
walking 
woman’s 
figure 
is 
led 
toward 
him, 
heavily 
veiled; 
let 
us 
imagine 
his 
sudden 
trembling 
unrest, 
his 
tempestuous 
comparisons, 
his 
instinctive 
conviction—and 
we 
have 
an 
analogy 
with 
what 
the 
spectator 
felt 
in 
his 
Dionysian 
excitement 
when 
he 
saw 
the 
approach 
on 
the 
stage 
of 
the 
god 
with 
whose 
sufferings 
he 
had 
already 
identified 
himself. 
Involuntarily, 
he 
transferred 
the 
whole 
magic 
image 
of 
the 
god 
that 
was 
trembling 
before 
his 
soul 
to 
that 
masked 
figure 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
dissolved 
its 
reality 
into 
the 
unreality 
of 
spirits. 


This 
is 
the 
Apollinian 
state 
of 
dreams 
in 
which 
the 
world 
of 
the 
day 
becomes 
veiled, 
and 
a 
new 
world, 
clearer, 
more 
understandable, 
more 
moving 
than 
the 
everyday 
world 
and 
yet 
more 
shadowy, 
presents 
itself 
to 
our 
eyes 
in 
continual 
rebirths. 
Accordingly, 
we 
recognize 
in 
tragedy 
a 
sweeping 
opposition 
of 
styles: 
the 
language, 
color, 
mobility, 
and 
dynamics 
of 
speech 
fall 
apart 
into 
the 
Dionysian 
lyrics 
of 
the 
chorus 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
Apollinian 
dream 
world, 
and 
become 
two 
utterly 
different 
spheres 
of 
expression. 
The 
Apollinian 
appearances 
in 
which 
Dionysus 
objectifies 



himself 
are 
no 
longer 
“an 
eternal 
sea, 
changeful 
strife, 
a 
glowing 
life,”7 
like 
the 
music 
of 
the 
chorus, 
no 
longer 
those 
forces, 
merely 
felt 
and 
not 
condensed 
into 
images, 
in 
which 
the 
enraptured 
servant 
of 
Dionysus 
senses 
the 
nearness 
of 
the 
god: 
now 
the 
clarity 
and 
firmness 
of 
epic 
form 
addresses 
him 
from 
the 
scene; 
now 
Dionysus 
no 
longer 
speaks 
through 
forces 
but 
as 
an 
epic 
hero, 
almost 
in 
the 
language 
of 
Homer. 



9 


Everything 
that 
comes 
to 
the 
surface 
in 
the 
Apollinian 
part 
of 
Greek 
tragedy, 
in 
the 
dialogue, 
looks 
simple, 
transparent, 
and 
beautiful. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
dialogue 
is 
an 
image 
of 
the 
Hellene 
whose 
nature 
is 
revealed 
in 
the 
dance 
because 
in 
the 
dance 
the 
greatest 
strength 
remains 
only 
potential 
but 
betrays 
itself 
in 
the 
suppleness 
and 
wealth 
of 
movement. 
Thus 
the 
language 
of 
Sophocles’ 
heroes 
amazes 
us 
by 
its 
Apollinian 
precision 
and 
lucidity, 
so 
we 
immediately 
have 
the 
feeling 
that 
we 
are 
looking 
into 
the 
innermost 
ground 
of 
their 
being, 
with 
some 
astonishment 
that 
the 
way 
to 
this 
ground 
should 
be 
so 
short. 
But 
suppose 
we 
disregard 
the 
character 
of 
the 
hero 
as 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
surface, 
visibly—after 
all, 
it 
is 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
nothing 
but 
a 
bright 
image 
projected 
on 
a 
dark 
wall, 
which 
means 
appearance1 
through 
and 
through; 
suppose 
we 
penetrate 
into 
the 
myth 
that 
projects 
itself 
in 
these 
lucid 
reflections: 
then 
we 
suddenly 
experience 
a 
phenomenon 
that 
is 
just 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
familiar 
optical 
phenomenon. 
When 
after 
a 
forceful 
attempt 
to 
gaze 
on 
the 
sun 
we 
turn 
away 
blinded, 
we 
see 
dark-colored 
spots 
before 
our 
eyes, 
as 
a 
cure, 
as 
it 
were. 
Conversely, 
the 
bright 
image 
projections 
of 
the 
Sophoclean 
hero—in 
short, 
the 
Apollinian 
aspect 
of 
the 
mask—are 
necessary 
effects 
of 
a 
glance 
into 
the 
inside 
and 
terrors 
of 
nature; 
as 
it 
were, 
luminous 
spots 
to 
cure 
eyes 
damaged 
by 
gruesome 
night. 
Only 
in 
this 
sense 
may 
we 
believe 
that 
we 
properly 
comprehend 
the 
serious 
and 
important 
concept 
of 
“Greek 
cheerfulness.” 
The 
misunderstanding 
of 
this 
concept 
as 
cheerfulness 
in 
a 
state 
of 
unendangered 
comfort 
is, 
of 
course, 
encountered 
everywhere 
today. 


Sophocles 
understood 
the 
most 
sorrowful 
figure 
of 
the 
Greek 
stage, 
the 
unfortunate 
Oedipus, 
as 
the 
noble 
human 
being 
who, 
in 
spite 
of 
his 
wisdom, 
is 
destined 
to 
error 
and 
misery 
but 
who 
eventually, 
through 
his 
tremendous 
suffering, 
spreads 
a 
magical 
power 
of 
blessing 
that 
remains 
effective 
even 
beyond 
his 
decease. 
The 
noble 
human 
being 
does 
not 
sin, 
the 
profound 
poet 
wants 
to 
tell 
us: 
though 
every 
law, 
every 
natural 
order, 
even 
the 
moral 
world 
may 
perish 
through 
his 
actions, 
his 
actions 
also 
produce 
a 
higher 
magical 
circle 
of 
effects 
which 
found 
a 
new 
world 
on 
the 
ruins 
of 
the 
old 
one 
that 
has 



been 
overthrown. 
That 
is 
what 
the 
poet 
wants 
to 
say 
to 
us 
insofar 
as 
he 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
religious 
thinker. 
As 
a 
poet 
he 
first 
shows 
us 
a 
marvelously 
tied 
knot 
of 
a 
trial, 
slowly 
unraveled 
by 
the 
judge, 
bit 
by 
bit, 
for 
his 
own 
undoing. 
The 
genuinely 
Hellenic 
delight 
at 
this 
dialectical 
solution 
is 
so 
great 
that 
it 
introduces 
a 
trait 
of 
superior 
cheerfulness 
into 
the 
whole 
work, 
everywhere 
softening 
the 
sharp 
points 
of 
the 
gruesome 
presuppositions 
of 
this 
process. 


In 
Oedipus 
at 
Colonus 
we 
encounter 
the 
same 
cheerfulness, 
but 
elevated 
into 
an 
infinite 
transfiguration. 
The 
old 
man, 
struck 
by 
an 
excess 
of 
misery, 
abandoned 
solely 
to 
suffer 
whatever 
befalls 
him, 
is 
confronted 
by 
the 
supraterrestrial 
cheerfulness 
that 
descends 
from 
the 
divine 
sphere 
and 
suggests 
to 
us 
that 
the 
hero 
attains 
his 
highest 
activity, 
extending 
far 
beyond 
his 
life, 
through 
his 
purely 
passive 
posture, 
while 
his 
conscious 
deeds 
and 
desires, 
earlier 
in 
his 
life, 
merely 
led 
him 
into 
passivity. 
Thus 
the 
intricate 
legal 
knot 
of 
the 
Oedipus 
fable 
that 
no 
mortal 
eye 
could 
unravel 
is 
gradually 
disentangled—and 
the 
most 
profound 
human 
joy 
overcomes 
us 
at 
this 
divine 
counterpart 
of 
the 
dialectic. 


If 
this 
explanation 
does 
justice 
to 
the 
poet 
one 
may 
yet 
ask 
whether 
it 
exhausts 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
myth—and 
then 
it 
becomes 
evident 
that 
the 
poet’s 
whole 
conception 
is 
nothing 
but 
precisely 
that 
bright 
image 
which 
healing 
nature 
projects 
before 
us 
after 
a 
glance 
into 
the 
abyss. 
Oedipus, 
the 
murderer 
of 
his 
father, 
the 
husband 
of 
his 
mother, 
the 
solver 
of 
the 
riddle 
of 
the 
Sphinx! 
What 
does 
the 
mysterious 
triad 
of 
these 
fateful 
deeds 
tell 
us? 


There 
is 
a 
tremendously 
old 
popular 
belief, 
especially 
in 
Persia, 
that 
a 
wise 
magus 
can 
be 
born 
only 
from 
incest. 
With 
the 
riddle-solving 
and 
mother-
marrying 
Oedipus 
in 
mind, 
we 
must 
immediately 
interpret 
this 
to 
mean 
that 
where 
prophetic 
and 
magical 
powers 
have 
broken 
the 
spell 
of 
present 
and 
future, 
the 
rigid 
law 
of 
individuation, 
and 
the 
real 
magic 
of 
nature, 
some 
enormously 
unnatural 
event—such 
as 
incest—must 
have 
occurred 
earlier, 
as 
a 
cause. 
How 
else 
could 
one 
compel 
nature 
to 
surrender 
her 
secrets 
if 
not 
by 
triumphantly 
resisting 
her, 
that 
is, 
by 
means 
of 
something 
unnatural? 
It 
is 
this 
insight 
that 
I 
find 
expressed 
in 
that 
horrible 
triad 
of 
Oedipus’ 
destinies: 
the 
same 
man 
who 
solves 
the 
riddle 
of 
nature—that 
Sphinx 
of 
two 
species2 
— 
also 
must 
break 
the 
most 
sacred 
natural 
orders 
by 
murdering 
his 
father 
and 
marrying 
his 
mother. 
Indeed, 
the 
myth 
seems 
to 
wish 
to 
whisper 
to 
us 
that 
wisdom, 
and 
particularly 
Dionysian 
wisdom, 
is 
an 
unnatural 
abomination; 
that 
he 
who 
by 
means 
of 
his 
knowledge 
plunges 
nature 
into 
the 
abyss 
of 



destruction 
must 
also 
suffer 
the 
dissolution 
of 
nature 
in 
his 
own 
person. 
“The 
edge 
of 
wisdom 
turns 
against 
the 
wise: 
wisdom 
is 
a 
crime 
against 
nature”: 
such 
horrible 
sentences 
are 
proclaimed 
to 
us 
by 
the 
myth; 
but 
the 
Hellenic 
poet 
touches 
the 
sublime 
and 
terrible 
Memnon’s 
Column 
of 
myth 
like 
a 
sunbeam, 
so 
that 
it 
suddenly 
begins 
to 
sound—in 
Sophoclean 
melodies.3 


Let 
me 
now 
contrast 
the 
glory 
of 
activity, 
which 
illuminates 
Aeschylus’ 
Prometheus, 
with 
the 
glory 
of 
passivity. 
What 
the 
thinker 
Aeschylus 
had 
to 
say 
to 
us 
here, 
but 
what 
as 
a 
poet 
he 
only 
allows 
us 
to 
sense 
in 
his 
symbolic 
image, 
the 
youthful 
Goethe 
was 
able 
to 
reveal 
to 
us 
in 
the 
audacious 
words 
of 
his 
Prometheus: 


Here 
I 
sit, 
forming 
men 
in 
my 
own 
image, 
a 
race 
to 
be 
like 
me, 
to 
suffer, 
to 
weep, 
to 
delight 
and 
to 
rejoice, 
and 
to 
defy 
you, 
as 
I 
do.4 


Man, 
rising 
to 
Titanic 
stature, 
gains 
culture 
by 
his 
own 
efforts 
and 
forces 
the 
gods 
to 
enter 
into 
an 
alliance 
with 
him 
because 
in 
his 
very 
own 
wisdom 
he 
holds 
their 
existence 
and 
their 
limitations 
in 
his 
hands. 
But 
what 
is 
most 
wonderful 
in 
this 
Prometheus 
poem, 
which 
in 
its 
basic 
idea 
is 
the 
veritable 
hymn 
of 
impiety, 
is 
the 
profoundly 
Aeschylean 
demand 
for 
justice. 
The 
immeasurable 
suffering 
of 
the 
bold 
“individual” 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
the 
divine 
predicament 
and 
intimation 
of 
a 
twilight 
of 
the 
gods 
on 
the 
other, 
the 
way 
the 
power 
of 
these 
two 
worlds 
of 
suffering 
compels 
a 
reconciliation, 
a 
metaphysical 
union—all 
this 
recalls 
in 
the 
strongest 
possible 
manner 
the 
center 
and 
main 
axiom 
of 
the 
Aeschylean 
view 
of 
the 
world 
which 
envisages 
Moira 
enthroned 
above 
gods 
and 
men 
as 
eternal 
justice. 


In 
view 
of 
the 
astonishing 
audacity 
with 
which 
Aeschylus 
places 
the 
Olympian 
world 
on 
the 
scales 
of 
his 
justice, 
we 
must 
call 
to 
mind 
that 
the 
profound 
Greek 
possessed 
an 
immovably 
firm 
foundation 
for 
metaphysical 
thought 
in 
his 
mysteries, 
and 
all 
his 
skeptical 
moods 
could 
be 
vented 
against 
the 
Olympians. 
The 
Greek 
artist 
in 
particular 
had 
an 
obscure 
feeling 
of 
mutual 
dependence 
when 
it 
came 
to 
the 
gods; 
and 
precisely 
in 
the 
Prometheus 
of 
Aeschylus 
this 
feeling 
is 
symbolized. 
In 
himself 
the 
Titanic 



artist 
found 
the 
defiant 
faith 
that 
he 
had 
the 
ability 
to 
create 
men 
and 
at 
least 
destroy 
Olympian 
gods, 
by 
means 
of 
his 
superior 
wisdom 
which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
he 
had 
to 
atone 
for 
with 
eternal 
suffering. 
The 
splendid 
“ability” 
of 
the 
great 
genius 
for 
which 
even 
eternal 
suffering 
is 
a 
slight 
price, 
the 
stern 
pride 
of 
the 
artist—that 
is 
the 
content 
and 
soul 
of 
Aeschylus’ 
poem, 
while 
Sophocles 
in 
his 
Oedipus 
sounds 
as 
a 
prelude 
the 
holy 
man’s 
song 
of 
triumph. 


But 
Aeschylus’ 
interpretation 
of 
the 
myth 
does 
not 
exhaust 
the 
astounding 
depth 
of 
its 
terror. 
Rather 
the 
artist’s 
delight 
in 
what 
becomes, 
the 
cheerfulness 
of 
artistic 
creation 
that 
defies 
all 
misfortune, 
is 
merely 
a 
bright 
image 
of 
clouds 
and 
sky 
mirrored 
in 
a 
black 
lake 
of 
sadness. 
The 
Prometheus 
story 
is 
an 
original 
possession 
of 
the 
entire 
Aryan 
community 
of 
peoples 
and 
evidences 
their 
gift 
for 
the 
profoundly 
tragic. 
Indeed, 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
improbable 
that 
this 
myth 
has 
the 
same 
characteristic 
significance 
for 
the 
Aryan 
character 
which 
the 
myth 
of 
the 
fall 
has 
for 
the 
Semitic 
character, 
and 
that 
these 
two 
myths 
are 
related 
to 
each 
other 
like 
brother 
and 
sister.5 
The 
presupposition 
of 
the 
Prometheus 
myth 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
extravagant 
value 
which 
a 
naïve 
humanity 
attached 
to 
fire 
as 
the 
true 
palladium 
of 
every 
ascending 
culture. 
But 
that 
man 
should 
freely 
dispose 
of 
fire 
without 
receiving 
it 
as 
a 
present 
from 
heaven, 
either 
as 
a 
lightning 
bolt 
or 
as 
the 
warming 
rays 
of 
the 
sun, 
struck 
these 
reflective 
primitive 
men 
as 
sacrilege, 
as 
a 
robbery 
of 
divine 
nature. 
Thus 
the 
very 
first 
philosophical 
problem 
immediately 
produces 
a 
painful 
and 
irresolvable 
contradiction 
between 
man 
and 
god 
and 
moves 
it 
before 
the 
gate 
of 
every 
culture, 
like 
a 
huge 
boulder. 
The 
best 
and 
highest 
possession 
mankind 
can 
acquire 
is 
obtained 
by 
sacrilege 
and 
must 
be 
paid 
for 
with 
consequences 
that 
involve 
the 
whole 
flood 
of 
sufferings 
and 
sorrows 
with 
which 
the 
offended 
divinities 
have 
to 
afflict 
the 
nobly 
aspiring 
race 
of 
men. 
This 
is 
a 
harsh 
idea 
which, 
by 
the 
dignity 
it 
confers 
on 
sacrilege, 
contrasts 
strangely 
with 
the 
Semitic 
myth 
of 
the 
fall 
in 
which 
curiosity, 
mendacious 
deception, 
susceptibility 
to 
seduction, 
lust—in 
short, 
a 
series 
of 
pre-eminently 
feminine 
affects 
was 
considered 
the 
origin 
of 
evil. 
What 
distinguishes 
the 
Aryan 
notion 
is 
the 
sublime 
view 
of 
active 
sin 
as 
the 
characteristically 
Promethean 
virtue. 
With 
that, 
the 
ethical 
basis 
for 
pessimistic 
tragedy 
has 
been 
found: 
the 
justification 
of 
human 
evil, 
meaning 
both 
human 
guilt 
and 
the 
human 
suffering 
it 
entails. 


The 
misfortune 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
which 
the 
contemplative 
Aryan 
is 
not 
inclined 
to 
interpret 
away—the 
contradiction 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
world 
reveals 
itself 
to 
him 
as 
a 
clash 
of 
different 
worlds, 
e.g., 
of 
a 
divine 
and 
human 



one, 
in 
which 
each, 
taken 
as 
an 
individual, 
has 
right 
on 
its 
side, 
but 
nevertheless 
has 
to 
suffer 
for 
its 
individuation, 
being 
merely 
a 
single 
one 
beside 
another. 
In 
the 
heroic 
effort 
of 
the 
individual 
to 
attain 
universality, 
in 
the 
attempt 
to 
transcend 
the 
curse 
of 
individuation 
and 
to 
become 
the 
one 
world-being, 
he 
suffers 
in 
his 
own 
person 
the 
primordial 
contradiction 
that 
is 
concealed 
in 
things, 
which 
means 
that 
he 
commits 
sacrilege 
and 
suffers. 


Thus 
the 
Aryans 
understand 
sacrilege 
as 
something 
masculine,6 
while 
the 
Semites 
understand 
sin 
as 
feminine,7 
just 
as 
the 
original 
sacrilege 
is 
committed 
by 
a 
man, 
the 
original 
sin 
by 
a 
woman. 
Also, 
the 
witches’ 
chorus 
says: 


If 
that 
is 
so, 
we 
do 
not 
mind 
it: 
With 
a 
thousand 
steps 
the 
women 
find 
it; 
But 
though 
they 
rush, 
we 
do 
not 
care: 
With 
one 
big 
jump 
the 
men 
get 
there.8 


Whoever 
understands 
this 
innermost 
kernel 
of 
the 
Prometheus 
story— 
namely, 
the 
necessity 
of 
sacrilege 
imposed 
upon 
the 
titanically 
striving 
individual—must 
also 
immediately 
feel 
how 
un-Apollinian 
this 
pessimistic 
notion 
is. 
For 
Apollo 
wants 
to 
grant 
repose 
to 
individual 
beings 
precisely 
by 
drawing 
boundaries 
between 
them 
and 
by 
again 
and 
again 
calling 
these 
to 
mind 
as 
the 
most 
sacred 
laws 
of 
the 
world, 
with 
his 
demands 
for 
self-
knowledge 
and 
measure. 


Lest 
this 
Apollinian 
tendency 
congeal 
the 
form 
to 
Egyptian 
rigidity 
and 
coldness, 
lest 
the 
effort 
to 
prescribe 
to 
the 
individual 
wave 
its 
path 
and 
realm 
might 
annul 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
whole 
lake, 
the 
high 
tide 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
destroyed 
from 
time 
to 
time 
all 
those 
little 
circles 
in 
which 
the 
one-sidedly 
Apollinian 
“will” 
had 
sought 
to 
confine 
the 
Hellenic 
spirit. 
The 
suddenly 
swelling 
Dionysian 
tide 
then 
takes 
the 
separate 
little 
wave-mountains 
of 
individuals 
on 
its 
back, 
even 
as 
Prometheus’ 
brother, 
the 
Titan 
Atlas, 
does 
with 
the 
earth. 
This 
Titanic 
impulse 
to 
become, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
Atlas 
for 
all 
individuals, 
carrying 
them 
on 
a 
broad 
back, 
higher 
and 
higher, 
farther 
and 
farther, 
is 
what 
the 
Promethean 
and 
the 
Dionysian 
have 
in 
common. 


In 
this 
respect, 
the 
Prometheus 
of 
Aeschylus 
is 
a 
Dionysian 
mask, 
while 
in 
the 
aforementioned 
profound 
demand 
for 
justice 
Aeschylus 
reveals 
to 
the 
thoughtful 
his 
paternal 
descent 
from 
Apollo, 
the 
god 
of 
individuation 
and 
of 
just 
boundaries. 
So 
the 
dual 
nature 
of 
Aeschylus’ 
Prometheus, 
his 
nature 



which 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
Dionysian 
and 
Apollinian, 
might 
be 
expressed 
thus 
in 
a 
conceptual 
formula: 
“All 
that 
exists 
is 
just 
and 
unjust 
and 
equally 
justified 
in 
both.” 


That 
is 
your 
world! 
A 
world 
indeed!—9

The 
tradition 
is 
undisputed 
that 
Greek 
tragedy 
in 
its 
earliest 
form 
had 
for 
its 
sole 
theme 
the 
sufferings 
of 
Dionysus 
and 
that 
for 
a 
long 
time 
the 
only 
stage 
hero 
was 
Dionysus 
himself. 
But 
it 
may 
be 
claimed 
with 
equal 
confidence 
that 
until 
Euripides, 
Dionysus 
never 
ceased 
to 
be 
the 
tragic 
hero; 
that 
all 
the 
celebrated 
figures 
of 
the 
Greek 
stage—Prometheus, 
Oedipus, 
etc. 
—are 
mere 
masks 
of 
this 
original 
hero, 
Dionysus. 
That 
behind 
all 
these 
masks 
there 
is 
a 
deity, 
that 
is 
one 
essential 
reason 
for 
the 
typical 
“ideality” 
of 
these 
famous 
figures 
which 
has 
caused 
so 
much 
astonishment. 
Somebody, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
who, 
has 
claimed 
that 
all 
individuals, 
taken 
as 
individuals, 
are 
comic 
and 
hence 
untragic—from 
which 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
the 
Greeks 
simply 
could 
not 
suffer 
individuals 
on 
the 
tragic 
stage. 
In 
fact, 
this 
is 
what 
they 
seem 
to 
have 
felt; 
and 
the 
Platonic 
distinction 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
“idea” 
and 
the 
“idol,” 
the 
mere 
image, 
is 
very 
deeply 
rooted 
in 
the 
Hellenic 
character. 


Using 
Plato’s 
terms 
we 
should 
have 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
tragic 
figures 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
stage 
somewhat 
as 
follows: 
the 
one 
truly 
real 
Dionysus 
appears 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
forms, 
in 
the 
mask 
of 
a 
fighting 
hero, 
and 
entangled, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
the 
net 
of 
the 
individual 
will. 
The 
god 
who 
appears 
talks 
and 
acts 
so 
as 
to 
resemble 
an 
erring, 
striving, 
suffering 
individual. 
That 
he 
appears 
at 
all 
with 
such 
epic 
precision 
and 
clarity 
is 
the 
work 
of 
the 
dream-interpreter, 
Apollo, 
who 
through 
this 
symbolic 
appearance 
interprets 
to 
the 
chorus 
its 
Dionysian 
state. 
In 
truth, 
however, 
the 
hero 
is 
the 
suffering 
Dionysus 
of 
the 
Mysteries, 
the 
god 
experiencing 
in 
himself 
the 
agonies 
of 
individuation, 
of 
whom 
wonderful 
myths 
tell 
that 
as 
a 
boy 
he 
was 
torn 
to 
pieces 
by 
the 
Titans 
and 
now 
is 
worshiped 
in 
this 
state 
as 
Zagreus. 
Thus 
it 
is 
intimated 
that 
this 
dismemberment, 
the 
properly 
Dionysian 
suffering, 
is 
like 
a 
transformation 
into 
air, 
water, 
earth, 
and 
fire, 
that 
we 
are 
therefore 
to 
regard 
the 
state 
of 
individuation 
as 
the 
origin 
and 
primal 
cause 
of 
all 
suffering, 
as 
something 
objectionable 
in 
itself. 
From 
the 
smile 
of 
this 
Dionysus 
sprang 
the 
Olympian 
gods, 
from 
his 
tears 
sprang 
man. 
In 
this 
existence 
as 
a 
dismembered 
god, 
Dionysus 
possesses 
the 
dual 
nature 
of 
a 
cruel, 
barbarized 
demon 
and 
a 
mild, 



gentle 
ruler. 
But 
the 
hope 
of 
the 
epopts1 
looked 
toward 
a 
rebirth 
of 
Dionysus, 
which 
we 
must 
now 
dimly 
conceive 
as 
the 
end 
of 
individuation. 
It 
was 
for 
this 
coming 
third 
Dionysus 
that 
the 
epopts’ 
roaring 
hymns 
of 
joy 
resounded. 
And 
it 
is 
this 
hope 
alone 
that 
casts 
a 
gleam 
of 
joy 
upon 
the 
features 
of 
a 
world 
torn 
asunder 
and 
shattered 
into 
individuals; 
this 
is 
symbolized 
in 
the 
myth 
of 
Demeter, 
sunk 
in 
eternal 
sorrow, 
who 
rejoices 
again 
for 
the 
first 
time 
when 
told 
that 
she 
may 
once 
more 
give 
birth 
to 
Dionysus. 
This 
view 
of 
things 
already 
provides 
us 
with 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
a 
profound 
and 
pessimistic 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
together 
with 
the 
mystery 
doctrine 
of 
tragedy: 
the 
fundamental 
knowledge 
of 
the 
oneness 
of 
everything 
existent, 
the 
conception 
of 
individuation 
as 
the 
primal 
cause 
of 
evil, 
and 
of 
art 
as 
the 
joyous 
hope 
that 
the 
spell 
of 
individuation 
may 
be 
broken 
in 
augury 
of 
a 
restored 
oneness. 


We 
have 
already 
suggested 
that 
the 
Homeric 
epos 
is 
the 
poem 
of 
Olympian 
culture, 
in 
which 
this 
culture 
has 
sung 
its 
own 
song 
of 
victory 
over 
the 
terrors 
of 
the 
war 
of 
the 
Titans. 
Under 
the 
predominating 
influence 
of 
tragic 
poetry, 
these 
Homeric 
myths 
are 
now 
born 
anew; 
and 
this 
metempsychosis 
reveals 
that 
in 
the 
meantime 
the 
Olympian 
culture 
also 
has 
been 
conquered 
by 
a 
still 
more 
profound 
view 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
defiant 
Titan 
Prometheus 
has 
announced 
to 
his 
Olympian 
tormentor 
that 
some 
day 
the 
greatest 
danger 
will 
menace 
his 
rule, 
unless 
Zeus 
should 
enter 
into 
an 
alliance 
with 
him 
in 
time. 
In 
Aeschylus 
we 
recognize 
how 
the 
terrified 
Zeus, 
fearful 
of 
his 
end, 
allies 
himself 
with 
the 
Titan. 
Thus 
the 
former 
age 
of 
the 
Titans 
is 
once 
more 
recovered 
from 
Tartarus 
and 
brought 
to 
the 
light. 


The 
philosophy 
of 
wild 
and 
naked 
nature 
beholds 
with 
the 
frank, 
undissembling 
gaze 
of 
truth 
the 
myths 
of 
the 
Homeric 
world 
as 
they 
dance 
past: 
they 
turn 
pale, 
they 
tremble 
under 
the 
piercing 
glance 
of 
this 
goddess2 
—till 
the 
powerful 
fist 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
artist 
forces 
them 
into 
the 
service 
of 
the 
new 
deity. 
Dionysian 
truth 
takes 
over 
the 
entire 
domain 
of 
myth 
as 
the 
symbolism 
of 
its 
knowledge 
which 
it 
makes 
known 
partly 
in 
the 
public 
cult 
of 
tragedy 
and 
partly 
in 
the 
secret 
celebrations 
of 
dramatic 
mysteries, 
but 
always 
in 
the 
old 
mythical 
garb. 


What 
power 
was 
it 
that 
freed 
Prometheus 
from 
his 
vultures 
and 
transformed 
the 
myth 
into 
a 
vehicle 
of 
Dionysian 
wisdom? 
It 
is 
the 
Heracleian 
power 
of 
music: 
having 
reached 
its 
highest 
manifestation 
in 
tragedy, 
it 
can 
invest 
myths 
with 
a 
new 
and 
most 
profound 
significance. 
This 
we 
have 
already 
characterized 
as 
the 
most 
powerful 
function 
of 
music. 
For 
it 
is 
the 
fate 
of 
every 
myth 
to 
creep 
by 
degrees 
into 
the 
narrow 
limits 
of 
some 



alleged 
historical 
reality, 
and 
to 
be 
treated 
by 
some 
later 
generation 
as 
a 
unique 
fact 
with 
historical 
claims: 
and 
the 
Greeks 
were 
already 
fairly 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
restamping 
the 
whole 
of 
their 
mythical 
juvenile 
dream 
sagaciously 
and 
arbitrarily 
into 
a 
historico-pragmatical 
juvenile 
history. 
For 
this 
is 
the 
way 
in 
which 
religions 
are 
wont 
to 
die 
out: 
under 
the 
stern, 
intelligent 
eyes 
of 
an 
orthodox 
dogmatism, 
the 
mythical 
premises 
of 
a 
religion 
are 
systematized 
as 
a 
sum 
total 
of 
historical 
events; 
one 
begins 
apprehensively 
to 
defend 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
myths, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
one 
opposes 
any 
continuation 
of 
their 
natural 
vitality 
and 
growth; 
the 
feeling 
for 
myth 
perishes, 
and 
its 
place 
is 
taken 
by 
the 
claim 
of 
religion 
to 
historical 
foundations. 
This 
dying 
myth 
was 
now 
seized 
by 
the 
new-born 
genius 
of 
Dionysian 
music; 
and 
in 
these 
hands 
it 
flourished 
once 
more 
with 
colors 
such 
as 
it 
had 
never 
yet 
displayed, 
with 
a 
fragrance 
that 
awakened 
a 
longing 
anticipation 
of 
a 
metaphysical 
world. 
After 
this 
final 
effulgence 
it 
collapses, 
its 
leaves 
wither, 
and 
soon 
the 
mocking 
Lucians 
of 
antiquity 
catch 
at 
the 
discolored 
and 
faded 
flowers 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
four 
winds. 
Through 
tragedy 
the 
myth 
attains 
its 
most 
profound 
content, 
its 
most 
expressive 
form; 
it 
rises 
once 
more 
like 
a 
wounded 
hero, 
and 
its 
whole 
excess 
of 
strength, 
together 
with 
the 
philosophic 
calm 
of 
the 
dying, 
burns 
in 
its 
eyes 
with 
a 
last 
powerful 
gleam. 


What 
did 
you 
want, 
sacrilegious 
Euripides, 
when 
you 
sought 
to 
compel 
this 
dying 
myth 
to 
serve 
you 
once 
more? 
It 
died 
under 
your 
violent 
hands— 
and 
then 
you 
needed 
a 
copied, 
masked 
myth 
that, 
like 
the 
ape 
of 
Heracles, 
merely 
knew 
how 
to 
deck 
itself 
out 
in 
the 
ancient 
pomp. 
And 
just 
as 
the 
myth 
died 
on 
you, 
the 
genius 
of 
music 
died 
on 
you, 
too. 
Though 
with 
greedy 
hands 
you 
plundered 
all 
the 
gardens 
of 
music, 
you 
still 
managed 
only 
copied, 
masked 
music. 
And 
because 
you 
had 
abandoned 
Dionysus, 
Apollo 
abandoned 
you: 
rouse 
all 
the 
passions 
from 
their 
resting 
places 
and 
conjure 
them 
into 
your 
circle, 
sharpen 
and 
whet 
a 
sophistical 
dialectic 
for 
the 
speeches 
of 
your 
heroes—your 
heroes, 
too, 
have 
only 
copied, 
masked 
passions 
and 
speak 
only 
copied, 
masked 
speeches. 



11 


Greek 
tragedy 
met 
an 
end 
different 
from 
that 
of 
her 
older 
sister-arts: 
she 
died 
by 
suicide, 
in 
consequence 
of 
an 
irreconcilable 
conflict; 
she 
died 
tragically, 
while 
all 
the 
others 
passed 
away 
calmly 
and 
beautifully 
at 
a 
ripe 
old 
age. 
If 
it 
be 
consonant 
with 
a 
happy 
natural 
state 
to 
take 
leave 
of 
life 
easily, 
leaving 
behind 
a 
fair 
posterity, 
the 
closing 
period 
of 
these 
older 
arts 
exhibits 
such 
a 
happy 
natural 
state: 
slowly 
they 
sink 
from 
sight, 
and 
before 
their 
dying 
eyes 
stand 
their 
fairer 
progeny, 
who 
lift 
up 
their 
heads 
impatiently, 
with 
a 
bold 
gesture. 
But 
when 
Greek 
tragedy 
died, 
there 
rose 
everywhere 
the 
deep 
sense 
of 
an 
immense 
void. 
Just 
as 
Greek 
sailors 
in 
the 
time 
of 
Tiberius 
once 
heard 
on 
a 
lonesome 
island 
the 
soul-shaking 
cry, 
“Great 
Pan 
is 
dead,” 
so 
the 
Hellenic 
world 
was 
now 
pierced 
by 
the 
grievous 
lament: 
“Tragedy 
is 
dead! 
Poetry 
itself 
has 
perished 
with 
her! 
Away 
with 
you, 
pale, 
meager 
epigones! 
Away 
to 
Hades, 
that 
you 
may 
for 
once 
eat 
your 
fill 
of 
the 
crumbs 
of 
our 
former 
masters!” 


When 
a 
new 
artistic 
genre 
blossomed 
forth 
after 
all, 
and 
revered 
tragedy 
as 
its 
predecessor 
and 
mistress, 
it 
was 
noted 
with 
horror 
that 
she 
did 
indeed 
bear 
the 
features 
of 
her 
mother—but 
those 
she 
had 
exhibited 
in 
her 
long 
death-
struggle. 
It 
was 
Euripides 
who 
fought 
this 
death 
struggle 
of 
tragedy; 
the 
later 
artistic 
genre 
is 
known 
as 
New 
Attic 
Comedy.1 
In 
it 
the 
degenerate 
form 
of 
tragedy 
lived 
on 
as 
a 
monument 
of 
its 
exceedingly 
painful 
and 
violent 
death. 


This 
connection 
helps 
to 
explain 
the 
passionate 
attachment 
that 
the 
poets 
of 
the 
New 
Comedy 
felt 
for 
Euripides; 
so 
that 
we 
are 
no 
longer 
surprised 
at 
the 
wish 
of 
Philemon, 
who 
would 
have 
let 
himself 
be 
hanged 
at 
once, 
merely 
that 
he 
might 
visit 
Euripides 
in 
the 
lower 
world—if 
only 
he 
could 
be 
certain 
that 
the 
deceased 
still 
had 
possession 
of 
his 
reason. 
But 
if 
we 
desire, 
as 
briefly 
as 
possible, 
and 
without 
claiming 
to 
say 
anything 
exhaustive, 
to 
characterize 
what 
Euripides 
has 
in 
common 
with 
Menander 
and 
Philemon, 
and 
what 
appealed 
to 
them 
so 
strongly 
as 
worthy 
of 
imitation, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
say 
that 
Euripides 
brought 
the 
spectator 
onto 
the 
stage. 
He 
who 
has 
perceived 
the 
material 
out 
of 
which 
the 
Promethean 
tragic 
writers 
prior 
to 
Euripides 
formed 
their 
heroes, 
and 
how 
remote 
from 
their 
purpose 
it 
was 
to 
bring 
the 
faithful 



mask 
of 
reality 
onto 
the 
stage, 
will 
also 
be 
aware 
of 
the 
utterly 
opposite 
tendency 
of 
Euripides. 
Through 
him 
the 
everyday 
man 
forced 
his 
way 
from 
the 
spectators’ 
seats 
onto 
the 
stage; 
the 
mirror 
in 
which 
formerly 
only 
grand 
and 
bold 
traits 
were 
represented 
now 
showed 
the 
painful 
fidelity 
that 
conscientiously 
reproduces 
even 
the 
botched 
outlines 
of 
nature. 


Odysseus, 
the 
typical 
Hellene 
of 
the 
older 
art, 
now 
sank, 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
new 
poets, 
to 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
Graeculus, 
who, 
as 
the 
good-naturedly 
cunning 
house-slave, 
henceforth 
occupies 
the 
center 
of 
dramatic 
interest. 
What 
Euripides 
claims 
credit 
for 
in 
Aristophanes’ 
Frogs,2 
namely, 
that 
his 
nostrums 
have 
liberated 
tragic 
art 
from 
its 
pompous 
corpulency, 
is 
apparent 
above 
all 
in 
his 
tragic 
heroes. 
The 
spectator 
now 
actually 
saw 
and 
heard 
his 
double 
on 
the 
Euripidean 
stage, 
and 
rejoiced 
that 
he 
could 
talk 
so 
well. 
But 
this 
joy 
was 
not 
all: 
one 
could 
even 
learn 
from 
Euripides 
how 
to 
speak 
oneself. 
He 
prides 
himself 
upon 
this 
in 
his 
contest 
with 
Aeschylus: 
from 
him 
the 
people 
have 
learned 
how 
to 
observe, 
debate, 
and 
draw 
conclusions 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
art 
and 
with 
the 
cleverest 
sophistries. 
Through 
this 
revolution 
in 
ordinary 
language, 
he 
made 
the 
New 
Comedy 
possible. 
For 
henceforth 
it 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
secret 
how—and 
with 
what 
maxims—everyday 
life 
could 
be 
represented 
on 
the 
stage. 
Civic 
mediocrity, 
on 
which 
Euripides 
built 
all 
his 
political 
hopes, 
was 
now 
given 
a 
voice, 
while 
heretofore 
the 
demigod 
in 
tragedy 
and 
the 
drunken 
satyr, 
or 
demiman, 
in 
comedy, 
had 
determined 
the 
character 
of 
the 
language. 
And 
so 
the 
Aristophanean 
Euripides 
prides 
himself 
on 
having 
portrayed 
the 
common, 
familiar, 
everyday 
life 
and 
activities 
of 
the 
people, 
about 
which 
all 
are 
qualified 
to 
pass 
judgment. 
If 
the 
entire 
populace 
now 
philosophized, 
managed 
land 
and 
goods, 
and 
conducted 
lawsuits 
with 
unheard-of 
circumspection, 
he 
deserved 
the 
credit, 
for 
this 
was 
the 
result 
of 
the 
wisdom 
he 
had 
inculcated 
in 
the 
people. 


It 
was 
to 
a 
populace 
thus 
prepared 
and 
enlightened 
that 
the 
New 
Comedy 
could 
address 
itself: 
it 
was 
Euripides 
who 
had 
taught, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
chorus; 
only 
now 
the 
chorus 
of 
spectators 
had 
to 
be 
trained. 
As 
soon 
as 
this 
chorus 
was 
trained 
to 
sing 
in 
the 
Euripidean 
key, 
there 
arose 
that 
drama 
which 
resembles 
a 
game 
of 
chess—the 
New 
Comedy, 
with 
its 
perpetual 
triumphs 
of 
cunning 
and 
craftiness. 
But 
Euripides—the 
chorus 
master—was 
praised 
continually: 
indeed, 
people 
would 
have 
killed 
themselves 
in 
order 
to 
learn 
still 
more 
from 
him, 
if 
they 
had 
not 
known 
that 
the 
tragic 
poets 
were 
quite 
as 
dead 
as 
tragedy. 
But 
with 
that, 
the 
Hellene 
had 
given 
up 
his 
belief 
in 



immortality; 
not 
only 
his 
belief 
in 
an 
ideal 
past, 
but 
also 
his 
belief 
in 
an 
ideal 
future. 
The 
words 
of 
the 
well-known 
epitaph, 
“frivolous 
and 
eccentric 
when 
an 
old 
man,”3 
also 
suit 
aging 
Hellenism. 
The 
passing 
moment, 
wit, 
levity, 
and 
caprice 
are 
its 
highest 
deities; 
the 
fifth 
estate, 
that 
of 
the 
slaves, 
now 
comes 
to 
power, 
at 
least 
in 
sentiment; 
and 
if 
we 
may 
still 
speak 
at 
all 
of 
“Greek 
cheerfulness,” 
it 
is 
the 
cheerfulness 
of 
the 
slave 
who 
has 
nothing 
of 
consequence 
to 
be 
responsible 
for, 
nothing 
great 
to 
strive 
for, 
and 
who 
does 
not 
value 
anything 
in 
the 
past 
or 
future 
higher 
than 
the 
present. 


It 
was 
this 
semblance 
of 
“Greek 
cheerfulness” 
which 
so 
aroused 
the 
profound 
and 
formidable 
natures 
of 
the 
first 
four 
centuries 
of 
Christianity: 
this 
womanish 
flight 
from 
seriousness 
and 
terror, 
this 
craven 
satisfaction 
with 
easy 
enjoyment, 
seemed 
to 
them 
not 
only 
contemptible, 
but 
a 
specifically 
anti-Christian 
sentiment. 
And 
it 
is 
due 
to 
their 
influence 
that 
the 
conception 
of 
Greek 
antiquity 
which 
endured 
through 
the 
centuries 
clung 
with 
almost 
unconquerable 
persistency 
to 
that 
pink 
hue 
of 
cheerfulness—as 
if 
there 
had 
never 
been 
a 
sixth 
century 
with 
its 
birth 
of 
tragedy, 
its 
mysteries, 
its 
Pythagoras 
and 
Heraclitus, 
as 
if 
the 
works 
of 
art 
of 
the 
great 
period 
simply 
did 
not 
exist, 
though 
these 
phenomena 
can 
hardly 
be 
explained 
as 
having 
originated 
in 
any 
such 
senile 
and 
slavish 
pleasure 
in 
existence 
and 
cheerfulness, 
and 
point 
to 
a 
wholly 
different 
conception 
of 
the 
world 
as 
the 
ground 
of 
their 
existence. 


The 
assertion 
made 
above, 
that 
Euripides 
brought 
the 
spectator 
onto 
the 
stage 
and 
thus 
qualified 
him 
to 
pass 
judgment 
on 
the 
drama, 
makes 
it 
appear 
as 
if 
the 
older 
tragic 
art 
had 
always 
suffered 
from 
bad 
relations 
with 
the 
spectator; 
and 
one 
might 
be 
tempted 
to 
extol 
as 
an 
advance 
over 
Sophocles 
the 
radical 
tendency 
of 
Euripides 
to 
produce 
a 
proper 
relation 
between 
art 
and 
the 
public. 
But 
“public,” 
after 
all, 
is 
a 
mere 
word. 
In 
no 
sense 
is 
it 
a 
homogeneous 
and 
constant 
quantity. 
Why 
should 
the 
artist 
be 
bound 
to 
accommodate 
himself 
to 
a 
power 
whose 
strength 
lies 
solely 
in 
numbers? 
And 
if, 
by 
virtue 
of 
his 
endowments 
and 
aspirations, 
he 
should 
feel 
himself 
superior 
to 
every 
one 
of 
these 
spectators, 
how 
could 
he 
feel 
greater 
respect 
for 
the 
collective 
expression 
of 
all 
these 
subordinate 
capacities 
than 
for 
the 
relatively 
highest-endowed 
individual 
spectator? 
In 
truth, 
if 
ever 
a 
Greek 
artist 
throughout 
a 
long 
life 
treated 
his 
public 
with 
audacity 
and 
self-
sufficiency, 
it 
was 
Euripides. 
When 
the 
masses 
threw 
themselves 
at 
his 
feet, 
he 
openly 
and 
with 
sublime 
defiance 
reversed 
his 
own 
tendency, 
the 
very 
tendency 
with 
which 
he 
had 
won 
over 
the 
masses. 
If 
this 
genius 
had 
had 
the 



slightest 
reverence 
for 
the 
pandemonium 
of 
the 
public, 
he 
would 
have 
broken 
down 
long 
before 
the 
middle 
of 
his 
career, 
beneath 
the 
heavy 
blows 
of 
his 
failures. 


These 
considerations 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
our 
formula—that 
Euripides 
brought 
the 
spectator 
onto 
the 
stage 
in 
order 
to 
make 
him 
truly 
competent 
to 
pass 
judgment—was 
merely 
provisional; 
we 
must 
penetrate 
more 
deeply 
to 
understand 
his 
tendency. 
Conversely, 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
Aeschylus 
and 
Sophocles 
during 
the 
whole 
of 
their 
lives, 
and 
indeed 
long 
after, 
were 
in 
complete 
possession 
of 
the 
people’s 
favor, 
so 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
a 
false 
relation 
between 
art 
and 
the 
public 
in 
the 
case 
of 
these 
predecessors 
of 
Euripides. 
What 
was 
it 
then 
that 
forcibly 
drove 
this 
artist, 
so 
richly 
endowed, 
so 
constantly 
impelled 
to 
production, 
from 
the 
path 
warmed 
by 
the 
sun 
of 
the 
greatest 
names 
in 
poetry 
and 
covered 
by 
the 
cloudless 
heaven 
of 
popular 
favor? 
What 
strange 
consideration 
for 
the 
spectator 
led 
him 
to 
oppose 
the 
spectator? 
How 
could 
he, 
out 
of 
too 
great 
a 
respect 
for 
his 
public—despise 
his 
public? 


Euripides—and 
this 
is 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
riddle 
just 
propounded— 
undoubtedly 
felt 
himself, 
as 
a 
poet, 
superior 
to 
the 
masses 
in 
general; 
but 
to 
two 
of 
his 
spectators 
he 
did 
not 
feel 
superior. 
He 
brought 
the 
masses 
onto 
the 
stage; 
but 
these 
two 
spectators 
he 
revered 
as 
the 
only 
competent 
judges 
and 
masters 
of 
his 
art. 
Complying 
with 
their 
directions 
and 
admonitions, 
he 
transferred 
the 
entire 
world 
of 
sentiments, 
passions, 
and 
experiences, 
hitherto 
present 
at 
every 
festival 
performance 
as 
the 
invisible 
chorus 
on 
the 
spectators’ 
benches, 
into 
the 
souls 
of 
his 
stage-heroes. 
He 
yielded 
to 
their 
demands, 
too, 
when 
for 
these 
new 
characters 
he 
sought 
out 
a 
new 
language 
and 
a 
new 
tone. 
Only 
in 
their 
voices 
could 
he 
hear 
any 
conclusive 
verdict 
on 
his 
work, 
and 
also 
the 
encouragement 
that 
promised 
eventual 
success 
when, 
as 
usual, 
he 
found 
himself 
condemned 
by 
the 
public 
judgment. 


Of 
these 
two 
spectators, 
one 
is—Euripides 
himself, 
Euripides 
as 
thinker, 
not 
as 
poet. 
It 
might 
be 
said 
of 
him, 
as 
of 
Lessing, 
that 
his 
extraordinary 
fund 
of 
critical 
talent, 
if 
it 
did 
not 
create, 
at 
least 
constantly 
stimulated 
his 
productive 
artistic 
impulse. 
With 
this 
gift, 
with 
all 
the 
brightness 
and 
dexterity 
of 
his 
critical 
thinking, 
Euripides 
had 
sat 
in 
the 
theater 
and 
striven 
to 
recognize 
in 
the 
masterpieces 
of 
his 
great 
predecessors, 
as 
in 
paintings 
that 
have 
become 
dark, 
feature 
after 
feature, 
line 
after 
line. 
And 
here 
he 
had 
experienced 
something 
which 
should 
not 
surprise 
anyone 
initiated 
into 
the 
deeper 
secrets 
of 
Aeschylean 
tragedy. 
He 
observed 
something 



incommensurable 
in 
every 
feature 
and 
in 
every 
line, 
a 
certain 
deceptive 
distinctness 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
enigmatic 
depth, 
indeed 
an 
infinitude, 
in 
the 
background. 
Even 
the 
clearest 
figure 
always 
had 
a 
comet’s 
tail 
attached 
to 
it 
which 
seemed 
to 
suggest 
the 
uncertain, 
that 
which 
could 
never 
be 
illuminated. 
A 
similar 
twilight 
shrouded 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
drama, 
especially 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
chorus. 
And 
how 
dubious 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
ethical 
problems 
remained 
to 
him! 
How 
questionable 
the 
treatment 
of 
the 
myths! 
How 
unequal 
the 
distribution 
of 
good 
and 
bad 
fortune! 
Even 
in 
the 
language 
of 
the 
Old 
Tragedy 
there 
was 
much 
he 
found 
offensive, 
or 
at 
least 
enigmatic; 
especially 
he 
found 
too 
much 
pomp 
for 
simple 
affairs, 
too 
many 
tropes 
and 
monstrous 
expressions 
to 
suit 
the 
plainness 
of 
the 
characters. 
So 
he 
sat 
in 
the 
theater, 
pondering 
uneasily, 
and 
as 
a 
spectator 
he 
confessed 
to 
himself 
that 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
his 
great 
predecessors. 
But 
if 
the 
understanding 
was 
for 
him 
the 
real 
root 
of 
all 
enjoyment 
and 
creation, 
he 
had 
to 
inquire 
and 
look 
around 
to 
see 
whether 
no 
one 
else 
had 
the 
same 
opinion 
and 
also 
felt 
this 
incommensurability. 
But 
most 
people, 
and 
among 
them 
the 
finest 
individuals, 
had 
only 
a 
suspicious 
smile 
for 
him, 
and 
none 
could 
explain 
to 
him 
why 
the 
great 
masters 
were 
still 
in 
the 
right 
despite 
his 
scruples 
and 
objections. 
And 
in 
this 
state 
of 
torment, 
he 
found 
that 
other 
spectator 
who 
did 
not 
comprehend 
tragedy 
and 
therefore 
did 
not 
esteem 
it. 
Allied 
with 
him, 
he 
could 
now 
venture 
from 
his 
solitude 
to 
begin 
the 
tremendous 
struggle 
against 
the 
art 
of 
Aeschylus 
and 
Sophocles—not 
with 
polemical 
essays, 
but 
as 
a 
dramatic 
poet 
who 
opposed 
his 
conception 
of 
tragedy 
to 
the 
traditional 
one. 
— 



12 


Before 
we 
name 
this 
other 
spectator, 
let 
us 
pause 
here 
a 
moment 
to 
recall 
to 
our 
minds 
our 
previously 
described 
impression 
of 
the 
discordant 
and 
incommensurable 
elements 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
Aeschylean 
tragedy. 
Let 
us 
recall 
our 
surprise 
at 
the 
chorus 
and 
the 
tragic 
hero 
of 
that 
tragedy, 
neither 
of 
which 
we 
could 
reconcile 
with 
our 
own 
customs 
any 
more 
than 
with 
tradition—till 
we 
rediscovered 
this 
duality 
itself 
as 
the 
origin 
and 
essence 
of 
Greek 
tragedy, 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
two 
interwoven 
artistic 
impulses, 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian. 


To 
separate 
this 
original 
and 
all-powerful 
Dionysian 
element 
from 
tragedy, 
and 
to 
reconstruct 
tragedy 
purely 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
un-Dionysian 
art, 
morality, 
and 
world 
view—this 
is 
the 
tendency 
of 
Euripides 
as 
it 
now 
reveals 
itself 
to 
us 
in 
clear 
illumination. 


In 
the 
evening 
of 
his 
life, 
Euripides 
himself 
propounded 
to 
his 
contemporaries 
the 
question 
of 
the 
value 
and 
significance 
of 
this 
tendency, 
using 
a 
myth. 
Is 
the 
Dionysian 
entitled 
to 
exist 
at 
all? 
Should 
it 
not 
be 
forcibly 
uprooted 
from 
Hellenic 
soil? 
Certainly, 
the 
poet 
tells 
us, 
if 
it 
were 
only 
possible: 
but 
the 
god 
Dionysus 
is 
too 
powerful; 
his 
most 
intelligent 
adversary—like 
Pentheus 
in 
the 
Bacchae—is 
unwittingly 
enchanted 
by 
him, 
and 
in 
this 
enchantment 
runs 
to 
meet 
his 
fate. 
The 
judgment 
of 
the 
two 
old 
men, 
Cadmus 
and 
Tiresias, 
seems 
also 
to 
be 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
old 
poet: 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
wisest 
individuals 
does 
not 
overthrow 
these 
old 
popular 
traditions, 
nor 
the 
perpetually 
self-propagating 
worship 
of 
Dionysus; 
rather 
it 
is 
proper 
to 
display 
a 
diplomatically 
cautious 
interest 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
such 
marvelous 
forces—although 
the 
possibility 
remains 
that 
the 
god 
may 
take 
offense 
at 
such 
lukewarm 
participation, 
and 
eventually 
transform 
the 
diplomat—like 
Cadmus—into 
a 
dragon. 
This 
is 
what 
we 
are 
told 
by 
a 
poet 
who 
opposed 
Dionysus 
with 
heroic 
valor 
throughout 
a 
long 
life—and 
who 
finally 
ended 
his 
career 
with 
a 
glorification 
of 
his 
adversary 
and 
with 
suicide, 
like 
a 
giddy 
man 
who, 
to 
escape 
the 
horrible 
vertigo 
he 
can 
no 
longer 
endure, 
casts 
himself 
from 
a 
tower. 


This 
tragedy 
was 
a 
protest 
against 
the 
practicability 
of 
his 
own 
tendency; 
but 
alas, 
it 
had 
already 
been 
put 
into 
practice! 
The 
marvel 
had 
happened: 



when 
the 
poet 
recanted, 
his 
tendency 
had 
already 
triumphed. 
Dionysus 
had 
already 
been 
scared 
from 
the 
tragic 
stage, 
by 
a 
demonic 
power 
speaking 
through 
Euripides. 
Even 
Euripides 
was, 
in 
a 
sense, 
only 
a 
mask: 
the 
deity 
that 
spoke 
through 
him 
was 
neither 
Dionysus 
nor 
Apollo, 
but 
an 
altogether 
newborn 
demon, 
called 
Socrates. 


This 
is 
the 
new 
opposition: 
the 
Dionysian 
and 
the 
Socratic—and 
the 
art 
of 
Greek 
tragedy 
was 
wrecked 
on 
this. 
Though 
Euripides 
may 
seek 
to 
comfort 
us 
by 
his 
recantation, 
he 
does 
not 
succeed: 
the 
most 
magnificent 
temple 
lies 
in 
ruins. 
What 
does 
the 
lamentation 
of 
the 
destroyer 
profit 
us, 
or 
his 
confession 
that 
it 
was 
the 
most 
beautiful 
of 
all 
temples? 
And 
even 
if 
Euripides 
has 
been 
punished 
by 
being 
changed 
into 
a 
dragon 
by 
the 
art 
critics 
of 
all 
ages—who 
could 
be 
content 
with 
so 
miserable 
a 
compensation? 


Let 
us 
now 
approach 
this 
Socratic 
tendency 
with 
which 
Euripides 
combated 
and 
vanquished 
Aeschylean 
tragedy. 


We 
must 
now 
ask 
ourselves, 
what 
could 
be 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
Euripidean 
design, 
which, 
in 
its 
most 
ideal 
form, 
would 
wish 
to 
base 
drama 
exclusively 
on 
the 
un-Dionysian? 
What 
form 
of 
drama 
still 
remained, 
if 
it 
was 
not 
to 
be 
born 
of 
the 
womb 
of 
music, 
in 
the 
mysterious 
twilight 
of 
the 
Dionysian? 
Only 
the 
dramatized 
epos—but 
in 
this 
Apollinian 
domain 
of 
art 
the 
tragic 
effect 
is 
certainly 
unattainable. 
The 
subject 
matter 
of 
the 
events 
represented 
is 
not 
decisive; 
indeed, 
I 
suggest 
that 
it 
would 
have 
been 
impossible 
for 
Goethe 
in 
his 
projected 
Nausikaa 
to 
have 
rendered 
tragically 
effective 
the 
suicide 
of 
this 
idyllic 
being, 
which 
was 
to 
have 
completed 
the 
fifth 
act. 
So 
extraordinary 
is 
the 
power 
of 
the 
epic-Apollinian 
that 
before 
our 
eyes 
it 
transforms 
the 
most 
terrible 
things 
by 
the 
joy 
in 
mere 
appearance 
and 
in 
redemption 
through 
mere 
appearance. 
The 
poet 
of 
the 
dramatized 
epos 
cannot 
blend 
completely 
with 
his 
images 
any 
more 
than 
the 
epic 
rhapsodist 
can. 
He 
is 
still 
that 
calm, 
unmoved 
contemplation 
which 
sees 
the 
images 
before 
its 
wide-open 
eyes. 
The 
actor 
in 
this 
dramatized 
epos 
still 
remains 
fundamentally 
a 
rhapsodist: 
the 
consecration 
of 
the 
inner 
dream 
lies 
on 
all 
his 
actions, 
so 
that 
he 
is 
never 
wholly 
an 
actor. 


How, 
then, 
is 
the 
Euripidean 
play 
related 
to 
this 
ideal 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
drama? 
Just 
as 
the 
younger 
rhapsodist 
is 
related 
to 
the 
solemn 
rhapsodist 
of 
old 
times. 
In 
the 
Platonic 
Ion, 
the 
younger 
rhapsodist 
describes 
his 
own 
nature 
as 
follows: 
“When 
I 
am 
saying 
anything 
sad, 
my 
eyes 
fill 
with 
tears; 
and 
when 
I 
am 
saying 
something 
awful 
and 
terrible, 
then 
my 
hair 
stands 
on 
end 
with 
fright 
and 
my 
heart 
beats 
quickly.” 
Here 
we 
no 
longer 
remark 



anything 
of 
the 
epic 
absorption 
in 
mere 
appearance, 
or 
of 
the 
dispassionate 
coolness 
of 
the 
true 
actor, 
who 
precisely 
in 
his 
highest 
activity 
is 
wholly 
mere 
appearance 
and 
joy 
in 
mere 
appearance. 
Euripides 
is 
the 
actor 
whose 
heart 
beats, 
whose 
hair 
stands 
on 
end; 
as 
Socratic 
thinker 
he 
designs 
the 
plan, 
as 
passionate 
actor 
he 
executes 
it. 
Neither 
in 
the 
designing 
nor 
in 
the 
execution 
is 
he 
a 
pure 
artist. 
Thus 
the 
Euripidean 
drama 
is 
a 
thing 
both 
cool 
and 
fiery, 
equally 
capable 
of 
freezing 
and 
burning. 
It 
is 
impossible 
for 
it 
to 
attain 
the 
Apollinian 
effect 
of 
the 
epos, 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
has 
alienated 
itself 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
from 
Dionysian 
elements. 
Now, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
effective 
at 
all, 
it 
requires 
new 
stimulants, 
which 
can 
no 
longer 
lie 
within 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
only 
two 
art-impulses, 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian. 
These 
stimulants 
are 
cool, 
paradoxical 
thoughts, 
replacing 
Apollinian 
contemplation 
—and 
fiery 
affects, 
replacing 
Dionysian 
ecstasies; 
and, 
it 
may 
be 
added, 
thoughts 
and 
affects 
copied 
very 
realistically 
and 
in 
no 
sense 
dipped 
into 
the 
ether 
of 
art. 


So 
we 
see 
that 
Euripides 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
basing 
the 
drama 
exclusively 
on 
the 
Apollinian, 
and 
his 
un-Dionysian 
tendency 
actually 
went 
astray 
and 
became 
naturalistic 
and 
inartistic. 
Now 
we 
should 
be 
able 
to 
come 
closer 
to 
the 
character 
of 
aesthetic 
Socratism, 
whose 
supreme 
law 
reads 
roughly 
as 
follows, 
“To 
be 
beautiful 
everything 
must 
be 
intelligible,” 
as 
the 
counterpart 
to 
the 
Socratic 
dictum, 
“Knowledge 
is 
virtue.” 
With 
this 
canon 
in 
his 
hands, 
Euripides 
measured 
all 
the 
separate 
elements 
of 
the 
drama—language, 
characters, 
dramaturgic 
structure, 
and 
choric 
music—and 
corrected 
them 
according 
to 
this 
principle. 


The 
poetic 
deficiency 
and 
degeneration, 
which 
are 
so 
often 
imputed 
to 
Euripides 
in 
comparison 
with 
Sophocles, 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
products 
of 
this 
penetrating 
critical 
process, 
this 
audacious 
reasonableness. 


The 
Euripidean 
prologue 
may 
serve 
as 
an 
example 
of 
the 
productivity 
of 
this 
rationalistic 
method. 
Nothing 
could 
be 
more 
uncongenial 
to 
the 
technique 
of 
our 
own 
stage 
than 
the 
prologue 
in 
the 
drama 
of 
Euripides. 
For 
a 
single 
person 
to 
appear 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
play, 
telling 
us 
who 
he 
is, 
what 
precedes 
the 
action, 
what 
has 
happened 
so 
far, 
even 
what 
will 
happen 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
play, 
would 
be 
condemned 
by 
a 
modern 
playwright 
as 
a 
willful, 
inexcusable 
abandonment 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
suspense. 
We 
know 
everything 
that 
is 
going 
to 
happen; 
who 
would 
want 
to 
wait 
till 
it 
actually 
does 
happen? 
After 
all, 
we 
do 
not 
even 
have 
the 
exciting 
relation 
of 
a 
prophetic 
dream 
to 
a 
reality 
that 
comes 
to 
be 
later 
on. 
But 
Euripides 
did 
not 
think 
like 
that 
at 
all. 
The 



effect 
of 
tragedy 
never 
depended 
on 
epic 
suspense, 
on 
a 
fascinating 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
what 
is 
to 
happen 
now 
and 
afterward, 
but 
rather 
on 
the 
great 
rhetorical-lyrical 
scenes 
in 
which 
the 
passion 
and 
dialectic 
of 
the 
protagonist 
swelled 
to 
a 
broad 
and 
powerful 
current. 
Everything 
laid 
the 
ground 
for 
pathos, 
not 
for 
action: 
and 
whatever 
was 
not 
directed 
toward 
pathos 
was 
considered 
objectionable. 
But 
what 
interferes 
most 
with 
the 
hearer’s 
pleasurable 
absorption 
in 
such 
scenes 
is 
any 
missing 
link, 
any 
gap 
in 
the 
texture 
of 
the 
background 
story. 
So 
long 
as 
the 
spectator 
has 
to 
figure 
out 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
or 
that 
person, 
or 
the 
presuppositions 
of 
this 
or 
that 
conflict 
of 
inclinations 
and 
purposes, 
he 
cannot 
become 
completely 
absorbed 
in 
the 
activities 
and 
sufferings 
of 
the 
chief 
characters 
or 
feel 
breathless 
pity 
and 
fear. 


Aeschylean-Sophoclean 
tragedy 
employed 
the 
most 
ingenious 
devices 
in 
the 
initial 
scenes 
to 
place 
in 
the 
spectator’s 
hands, 
as 
if 
by 
chance, 
all 
the 
threads 
necessary 
for 
a 
complete 
understanding—a 
trait 
proving 
that 
noble 
artistry 
which, 
as 
it 
were, 
masks 
the 
necessary 
formal 
element 
and 
makes 
it 
appear 
accidental. 
Yet 
Euripides 
thought 
he 
observed 
that 
during 
these 
first 
scenes 
the 
spectator 
was 
so 
anxious 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
background 
history 
that 
the 
poetic 
beauties 
and 
the 
pathos 
of 
the 
exposition 
were 
lost 
on 
him. 
So 
he 
put 
the 
prologue 
even 
before 
the 
exposition, 
and 
placed 
it 
in 
the 
mouth 
of 
a 
person 
who 
could 
be 
trusted: 
often 
some 
deity 
had 
to 
guarantee 
the 
plot 
of 
the 
tragedy 
to 
the 
public, 
to 
remove 
every 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
myth—somewhat 
as 
Descartes 
could 
prove 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
empirical 
world 
only 
by 
appealing 
to 
the 
truthfulness 
of 
God 
and 
his 
inability 
to 
utter 
falsehood. 
Euripides 
makes 
use 
of 
this 
same 
divine 
truthfulness 
once 
more 
at 
the 
close 
of 
his 
drama, 
in 
order 
to 
reassure 
the 
public 
as 
to 
the 
future 
of 
his 
heroes; 
this 
is 
the 
task 
of 
the 
notorious 
deus 
ex 
machina. 
Between 
this 
epic 
preview 
and 
epic 
prospect 
lies 
the 
dramatic-lyric 
present, 
the 
“drama” 
proper. 


Thus 
Euripides 
as 
a 
poet 
is 
essentially 
an 
echo 
of 
his 
own 
conscious 
knowledge; 
and 
it 
is 
precisely 
on 
this 
account 
that 
he 
occupies 
such 
a 
remarkable 
position 
in 
the 
history 
of 
Greek 
art. 
With 
reference 
to 
his 
critical-
productive 
activity, 
he 
must 
often 
have 
felt 
as 
if 
he 
had 
to 
bring 
to 
life 
for 
drama 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
essay 
of 
Anaxagoras: 
“In 
the 
beginning 
all 
things 
were 
mixed 
together; 
then 
came 
the 
understanding 
and 
created 
order.” 
Anaxagoras 
with 
his 
“nous”1 
is 
said 
to 
have 
appeared 
among 
philosophers 
as 
the 
first 
sober 
person2 
amid 
a 
crowd 
of 
drunken 
ones. 
Euripides 
may 
have 
conceived 
his 
relation 
to 
the 
other 
tragic 
poets 
in 
terms 
of 
a 
similar 
image. 
As 



long 
as 
the 
sole 
ruler 
and 
disposer 
of 
the 
universe, 
the 
nous, 
remained 
excluded 
from 
artistic 
activity, 
things 
were 
all 
mixed 
together 
in 
a 
primeval 
chaos: 
this 
was 
what 
Euripides 
must 
have 
thought; 
and 
so, 
as 
the 
first 
“sober” 
one 
among 
them, 
he 
had 
to 
condemn 
the 
“drunken” 
poets. 
Sophocles 
said 
of 
Aeschylus 
that 
he 
did 
what 
was 
right, 
though 
he 
did 
it 
unconsciously. 
This 
was 
surely 
not 
how 
Euripides 
saw 
it. 
He 
might 
have 
said 
that 
Aeschylus, 
because 
he 
created 
unconsciously, 
did 
what 
was 
wrong. 
The 
divine 
Plato, 
too, 
almost 
always 
speaks 
only 
ironically 
of 
the 
creative 
faculty 
of 
the 
poet, 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
not 
conscious 
insight, 
and 
places 
it 
on 
a 
par 
with 
the 
gift 
of 
the 
soothsayer 
and 
dream-interpreter: 
the 
poet 
is 
incapable 
of 
composing 
until 
he 
has 
become 
unconscious 
and 
bereft 
of 
understanding. 
Like 
Plato, 
Euripides 
undertook 
to 
show 
to 
the 
world 
the 
reverse 
of 
the 
“unintelligent” 
poet; 
his 
aesthetic 
principle 
that 
“to 
be 
beautiful 
everything 
must 
be 
conscious” 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
the 
parallel 
to 
the 
Socratic, 
“to 
be 
good 
everything 
must 
be 
conscious.” 
So 
we 
may 
consider 
Euripides 
as 
the 
poet 
of 
aesthetic 
Socratism. 


Socrates, 
however, 
was 
that 
second 
spectator 
who 
did 
not 
comprehend 
and 
therefore 
did 
not 
esteem 
the 
Old 
Tragedy; 
in 
alliance 
with 
him 
Euripides 
dared 
to 
be 
the 
herald 
of 
a 
new 
art. 
If 
it 
was 
this 
of 
which 
the 
older 
tragedy 
perished, 
then 
aesthetic 
Socratism 
was 
the 
murderous 
principle; 
but 
insofar 
as 
the 
struggle 
was 
directed 
against 
the 
Dionysian 
element 
in 
the 
older 
tragedy, 
we 
may 
recognize 
in 
Socrates 
the 
opponent 
of 
Dionysus. 
He 
is 
the 
new 
Orpheus 
who 
rose 
against 
Dionysus, 
and 
although 
he 
is 
destined 
to 
be 
torn 
to 
pieces 
by 
the 
Maenads 
of 
the 
Athenian 
court, 
he 
still 
put 
to 
flight 
the 
powerful 
god 
himself—who, 
as 
on 
his 
flight 
from 
Lycurgus 
the 
King 
of 
Edoni, 
sought 
refuge 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
the 
sea, 
namely 
the 
mystical 
flood 
of 
a 
secret 
cult 
which 
gradually 
covered 
the 
earth. 



13 


That 
Socrates 
was 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
tendency 
of 
Euripides 
did 
not 
escape 
the 
notice 
of 
contemporaneous 
antiquity. 
The 
most 
eloquent 
expression 
of 
this 
felicitous 
insight 
was 
the 
story 
current 
in 
Athens 
that 
Socrates 
used 
to 
help 
Euripides 
write 
his 
plays. 
Whenever 
an 
occasion 
arose 
to 
enumerate 
the 
demagogues 
of 
the 
day, 
the 
adherents 
of 
the 
“good 
old 
times” 
would 
mention 
both 
names 
in 
the 
same 
breath. 
To 
the 
influence 
of 
Socrates 
and 
Euripides 
they 
attributed 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
old 
Marathonian 
stalwart 
fitness 
of 
body 
and 
soul 
was 
being 
sacrificed 
more 
and 
more 
to 
a 
dubious 
enlightenment 
that 
involved 
the 
progressive 
degeneration 
of 
the 
powers 
of 
body 
and 
soul. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
tone, 
half 
indignant, 
half 
contemptuous, 
that 
Aristophanic 
comedy 
used 
to 
speak 
of 
both 
of 
them—to 
the 
consternation 
of 
modern 
men, 
who 
are 
quite 
willing 
to 
give 
up 
Euripides, 
but 
who 
cannot 
give 
sufficient 
expression 
to 
their 
astonishment 
that 
in 
Aristophanes 
Socrates 
should 
appear 
as 
the 
first 
and 
supreme 
Sophist, 
as 
the 
mirror 
and 
epitome 
of 
all 
sophistical 
tendencies. 
Their 
only 
consolation 
is 
to 
pillory 
Aristophanes 
himself 
as 
a 
dissolute, 
mendacious 
Alcibiades 
of 
poetry. 
Without 
here 
defending 
the 
profound 
instinct 
of 
Aristophanes 
against 
such 
attacks, 
I 
shall 
continue 
to 
show, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
sentiments 
of 
the 
time, 
the 
close 
connection 
between 
Socrates 
and 
Euripides. 
With 
this 
in 
view, 
we 
must 
remember 
particularly 
how 
Socrates, 
as 
an 
opponent 
of 
tragic 
art, 
refrained 
from 
attending 
tragedies 
and 
appeared 
among 
the 
spectators 
only 
when 
a 
new 
play 
of 
Euripides 
was 
to 
be 
performed. 
Most 
famous 
of 
all, 
however, 
is 
the 
juxtaposition 
of 
the 
two 
names 
by 
the 
Delphic 
oracle, 
which 
designated 
Socrates 
as 
the 
wisest 
of 
men 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
decided 
that 
the 
second 
prize 
in 
the 
contest 
of 
wisdom 
belonged 
to 
Euripides. 


Sophocles 
was 
named 
third 
in 
order 
of 
rank—he 
who 
could 
boast 
that, 
as 
compared 
with 
Aeschylus, 
he 
did 
what 
was 
right 
because 
he 
knew 
what 
was 
right. 
Evidently 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
degree 
of 
the 
brightness 
of 
this 
knowledge 
which 
distinguishes 
these 
three 
men 
in 
common 
as 
the 
three 
“knowing 
ones” 
of 
their 
time. 


The 
most 
acute 
word, 
however, 
about 
this 
new 
and 
unprecedented 
value 
set 
on 
knowledge 
and 
insight 
was 
spoken 
by 
Socrates 
when 
he 
found 
that 
he 



was 
the 
only 
one 
who 
acknowledged 
to 
himself 
that 
he 
knew 
nothing, 
whereas 
in 
his 
critical 
peregrinations 
through 
Athens 
he 
had 
called 
on 
the 
greatest 
statesmen, 
orators, 
poets, 
and 
artists, 
and 
had 
everywhere 
discovered 
the 
conceit 
of 
knowledge. 
To 
his 
astonishment 
he 
perceived 
that 
all 
these 
celebrities 
were 
without 
a 
proper 
and 
sure 
insight, 
even 
with 
regard 
to 
their 
own 
professions, 
and 
that 
they 
practiced 
them 
only 
by 
instinct. 
“Only 
by 
instinct”: 
with 
this 
phrase 
we 
touch 
upon 
the 
heart 
and 
core 
of 
the 
Socratic 
tendency. 
With 
it 
Socratism 
condemns 
existing 
art 
as 
well 
as 
existing 
ethics. 
Wherever 
Socratism 
turns 
its 
searching 
eyes 
it 
sees 
lack 
of 
insight 
and 
the 
power 
of 
illusion; 
and 
from 
this 
lack 
it 
infers 
the 
essential 
perversity 
and 
reprehensibility 
of 
what 
exists. 
Basing 
himself 
on 
this 
point, 
Socrates 
conceives 
it 
to 
be 
his 
duty 
to 
correct 
existence: 
all 
alone, 
with 
an 
expression 
of 
irreverence 
and 
superiority, 
as 
the 
precursor 
of 
an 
altogether 
different 
culture, 
art, 
and 
morality, 
he 
enters 
a 
world, 
to 
touch 
whose 
very 
hem 
would 
give 
us 
the 
greatest 
happiness. 


This 
is 
what 
strikes 
us 
as 
so 
tremendously 
problematic 
whenever 
we 
consider 
Socrates, 
and 
again 
and 
again 
we 
are 
tempted 
to 
fathom 
the 
meaning 
and 
purpose 
of 
this 
most 
questionable 
phenomenon 
of 
antiquity. 
Who 
is 
it 
that 
may 
dare 
single-handed 
to 
negate 
the 
Greek 
genius 
that, 
as 
Homer, 
Pindar, 
and 
Aeschylus, 
as 
Phidias, 
as 
Pericles, 
as 
Pythia 
and 
Dionysus, 
as 
the 
deepest 
abyss 
and 
the 
highest 
height, 
is 
sure 
of 
our 
astonished 
veneration? 
What 
demonic 
power 
is 
this 
that 
dares 
to 
spill 
this 
magic 
potion 
into 
dust? 
What 
demigod 
is 
this 
to 
whom 
the 
chorus 
of 
the 
noblest 
spirits 
of 
mankind 
must 
call 
out: 


Alas! 
You 
have 
shattered 
The 
beautiful 
world 
With 
brazen 
fist; 
It 
falls, 
it 
is 
scattered.1 


We 
are 
offered 
a 
key 
to 
the 
character 
of 
Socrates 
by 
the 
wonderful 
phenomenon 
known 
as 
“the 
daimonion 
of 
Socrates.” 
In 
exceptional 
circumstances, 
when 
his 
tremendous 
intellect 
wavered, 
he 
found 
secure 
support 
in 
the 
utterances 
of 
a 
divine 
voice 
that 
spoke 
up 
at 
such 
moments. 
This 
voice, 
whenever 
it 
comes, 
always 
dissuades. 
In 
this 
utterly 
abnormal 
nature, 
instinctive 
wisdom 
appears 
only 
in 
order 
to 
hinder 
conscious 



knowledge 
occasionally. 
While 
in 
all 
productive 
men 
it 
is 
instinct 
that 
is 
the 
creative-affirmative 
force, 
and 
consciousness 
acts 
critically 
and 
dissuasively, 
in 
Socrates 
it 
is 
instinct 
that 
becomes 
the 
critic, 
and 
consciousness 
that 
becomes 
the 
creator—truly 
a 
monstrosity 
per 
defectum! 
Specifically, 
we 
observe 
here 
a 
monstrous 
defectus 
of 
any 
mystical 
disposition, 
so 
Socrates 
might 
be 
called 
the 
typical 
non-mystic, 
in 
whom, 
through 
a 
hypertrophy, 
the 
logical 
nature 
is 
developed 
as 
excessively 
as 
instinctive 
wisdom 
is 
in 
the 
mystic. 
But 
the 
logical 
urge 
that 
became 
manifest 
in 
Socrates 
was 
absolutely 
prevented 
from 
turning 
against 
itself; 
in 
its 
unbridled 
flood 
it 
displays 
a 
natural 
power 
such 
as 
we 
encounter 
to 
our 
awed 
amazement 
only 
in 
the 
very 
greatest 
instinctive 
forces. 
Anyone 
who, 
through 
the 
Platonic 
writings, 
has 
experienced 
even 
a 
breath 
of 
the 
divine 
naïveté 
and 
sureness 
of 
the 
Socratic 
way 
of 
life, 
will 
also 
feel 
how 
the 
enormous 
driving-wheel 
of 
logical 
Socratism 
is 
in 
motion, 
as 
it 
were, 
behind 
Socrates, 
and 
that 
it 
must 
be 
viewed 
through 
Socrates 
as 
through 
a 
shadow. 


His 
own 
sense 
of 
this 
relationship 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
dignified 
seriousness 
with 
which 
he 
everywhere, 
even 
before 
his 
judges, 
insisted 
on 
his 
divine 
calling. 
At 
bottom, 
it 
was 
as 
impossible 
to 
refute 
him 
here 
as 
to 
approve 
of 
his 
instinct-disintegrating 
influence. 
In 
view 
of 
this 
indissoluble 
conflict, 
when 
he 
had 
at 
last 
been 
brought 
before 
the 
forum 
of 
the 
Greek 
state, 
only 
one 
kind 
of 
punishment 
was 
indicated: 
exile. 
Being 
thoroughly 
enigmatical, 
unclassifiable, 
and 
inexplicable, 
he 
might 
have 
been 
asked 
to 
leave 
the 
city, 
and 
posterity 
would 
never 
have 
been 
justified 
in 
charging 
the 
Athenians 
with 
an 
ignominious 
deed. 
But 
that 
he 
was 
sentenced 
to 
death, 
not 
exile, 
Socrates 
himself 
seems 
to 
have 
brought 
about 
with 
perfect 
awareness 
and 
without 
any 
natural 
awe 
of 
death. 
He 
went 
to 
his 
death 
with 
the 
calm 
with 
which, 
according 
to 
Plato’s 
description, 
he 
leaves 
the 
Symposium 
at 
dawn, 
the 
last 
of 
the 
revelers, 
to 
begin 
a 
new 
day, 
while 
on 
the 
benches 
and 
on 
the 
earth 
his 
drowsy 
table 
companions 
remain 
behind 
to 
dream 
of 
Socrates, 
the 
true 
eroticist. 
The 
dying 
Socrates 
became 
the 
new 
ideal, 
never 
seen 
before, 
of 
noble 
Greek 
youths: 
above 
all, 
the 
typical 
Hellenic 
youth, 
Plato, 
prostrated 
himself 
before 
this 
image 
with 
all 
the 
ardent 
devotion 
of 
his 
enthusiastic 
soul. 



14 


Let 
us 
now 
imagine 
the 
one 
great 
Cyclops 
eye 
of 
Socrates 
fixed 
on 
tragedy, 
an 
eye 
in 
which 
the 
fair 
frenzy 
of 
artistic 
enthusiasm 
had 
never 
glowed. 
To 
this 
eye 
was 
denied 
the 
pleasure 
of 
gazing 
into 
the 
Dionysian 
abysses. 
What, 
then, 
did 
it 
have 
to 
see 
in 
the 
“sublime 
and 
greatly 
lauded” 
tragic 
art, 
as 
Plato 
called 
it? 
Something 
rather 
unreasonable, 
full 
of 
causes 
apparently 
without 
effects, 
and 
effects 
apparently 
without 
causes; 
the 
whole, 
moreover, 
so 
motley 
and 
manifold 
that 
it 
could 
not 
but 
be 
repugnant 
to 
a 
sober 
mind, 
and 
a 
dangerous 
tinder 
for 
sensitive 
and 
susceptible 
souls. 
We 
know 
the 
only 
kind 
of 
poetry 
he 
comprehended: 
the 
Aesopian 
fable; 
and 
this 
he 
favored 
no 
doubt 
with 
the 
smiling 
accommodation 
with 
which 
the 
good 
honest 
Gellert 
sings 
the 
praise 
of 
poetry 
in 
the 
fable 
of 
the 
bee 
and 
the 
hen: 


Poems 
are 
useful: 
they 
can 
tell 
The 
truth 
by 
means 
of 
parable 
To 
those 
who 
are 
not 
very 
bright. 


But 
to 
Socrates 
it 
seemed 
that 
tragic 
art 
did 
not 
even 
“tell 
the 
truth”; 
moreover, 
it 
addressed 
itself 
to 
“those 
who 
are 
not 
very 
bright,” 
not 
to 
the 
philosopher: 
a 
twofold 
reason 
for 
shunning 
it. 
Like 
Plato, 
he 
reckoned 
it 
among 
the 
flattering 
arts 
which 
portray 
only 
the 
agreeable, 
not 
the 
useful; 
and 
therefore 
he 
required 
of 
his 
disciples 
abstinence 
and 
strict 
separation 
from 
such 
unphilosophical 
attractions—with 
such 
success 
that 
the 
youthful 
tragic 
poet 
Plato 
first 
burned 
his 
poems 
that 
he 
might 
become 
a 
student 
of 
Socrates. 
But 
where 
unconquerable 
propensities 
struggled 
against 
the 
Socratic 
maxims, 
their 
power, 
together 
with 
the 
impact 
of 
his 
tremendous 
character, 
was 
still 
great 
enough 
to 
force 
poetry 
itself 
into 
new 
and 
hitherto 
unknown 
channels. 


An 
instance 
of 
this 
is 
Plato, 
who 
in 
condemning 
tragedy 
and 
art 
in 
general 
certainly 
did 
not 
lag 
behind 
the 
naïve 
cynicism 
of 
his 
master; 
he 
was 
nevertheless 
constrained 
by 
sheer 
artistic 
necessity 
to 
create 
an 
art 
form 
that 
was 
related 
to 
those 
forms 
of 
art 
which 
he 
repudiated. 
Plato’s 
main 
objection 
to 
the 
older 
art—that 
it 
is 
the 
imitation 
of 
a 
phantom 
and 
hence 
belongs 
to 
a 
sphere 
even 
lower 
than 
the 
empirical 
world—could 
certainly 
not 
be 
directed 



against 
the 
new 
art; 
and 
so 
we 
find 
Plato 
endeavoring 
to 
transcend 
reality 
and 
to 
represent 
the 
idea 
which 
underlies 
this 
pseudo-reality. 
Thus 
Plato, 
the 
thinker, 
arrived 
by 
a 
detour 
where 
he 
had 
always 
been 
at 
home 
as 
a 
poet—at 
the 
point 
from 
which 
Sophocles 
and 
the 
older 
art 
protested 
solemnly 
against 
that 
objection. 
If 
tragedy 
had 
absorbed 
into 
itself 
all 
the 
earlier 
types 
of 
art, 
the 
same 
might 
also 
be 
said 
in 
an 
eccentric 
sense 
of 
the 
Platonic 
dialogue 
which, 
a 
mixture 
of 
all 
extant 
styles 
and 
forms, 
hovers 
midway 
between 
narrative, 
lyric, 
and 
drama, 
between 
prose 
and 
poetry, 
and 
so 
has 
also 
broken 
the 
strict 
old 
law 
of 
the 
unity 
of 
linguistic 
form. 
This 
tendency 
was 
carried 
still 
further 
by 
the 
Cynic 
writers, 
who 
in 
the 
greatest 
stylistic 
medley, 
oscillating 
between 
prose 
and 
metrical 
forms, 
realized 
also 
the 
literary 
image 
of 
the 
“raving 
Socrates” 
whom 
they 
represented 
in 
real 
life. 


The 
Platonic 
dialogue 
was, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
barge 
on 
which 
the 
shipwrecked 
ancient 
poetry 
saved 
herself 
with 
all 
her 
children: 
crowded 
into 
a 
narrow 
space 
and 
timidly 
submitting 
to 
the 
single 
pilot, 
Socrates, 
they 
now 
sailed 
into 
a 
new 
world, 
which 
never 
tired 
of 
looking 
at 
the 
fantastic 
spectacle 
of 
this 
procession. 
Indeed, 
Plato 
has 
given 
to 
all 
posterity 
the 
model 
of 
a 
new 
art 
form, 
the 
model 
of 
the 
novel—which 
may 
be 
described 
as 
an 
infinitely 
enhanced 
Aesopian 
fable, 
in 
which 
poetry 
holds 
the 
same 
rank 
in 
relation 
to 
dialectical 
philosophy 
as 
this 
same 
philosophy 
held 
for 
many 
centuries 
in 
relation 
to 
theology: 
namely, 
the 
rank 
of 
ancilla.1 
This 
was 
the 
new 
position 
into 
which 
Plato, 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
demonic 
Socrates, 
forced 
poetry. 


Here 
philosophic 
thought 
overgrows 
art 
and 
compels 
it 
to 
cling 
close 
to 
the 
trunk 
of 
dialectic. 
The 
Apollinian 
tendency 
has 
withdrawn 
into 
the 
cocoon 
of 
logical 
schematism; 
just 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Euripides 
we 
noticed 
something 
analogous, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
transformation 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
into 
naturalistic 
affects. 
Socrates, 
the 
dialectical 
hero 
of 
the 
Platonic 
drama, 
reminds 
us 
of 
the 
kindred 
nature 
of 
the 
Euripidean 
hero 
who 
must 
defend 
his 
actions 
with 
arguments 
and 
counterarguments 
and 
in 
the 
process 
often 
risks 
the 
loss 
of 
our 
tragic 
pity; 
for 
who 
could 
mistake 
the 
optimistic 
element 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
dialectic, 
which 
celebrates 
a 
triumph 
with 
every 
conclusion 
and 
can 
breathe 
only 
in 
cool 
clarity 
and 
consciousness—the 
optimistic 
element 
which, 
having 
once 
penetrated 
tragedy 
must 
gradually 
overgrow 
its 
Dionysian 
regions 
and 
impel 
it 
necessarily 
to 
self-destruction—to 
the 
death-leap 
into 
the 
bourgeois 
drama. 
Consider 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
Socratic 
maxims: 
“Virtue 
is 
knowledge; 
man 
sins 
only 
from 
ignorance; 
he 
who 
is 
virtuous 
is 
happy.” 
In 
these 
three 
basic 
forms 
of 
optimism 
lies 
the 
death 
of 
tragedy. 
For 
now 
the 



virtuous 
hero 
must 
be 
a 
dialectician; 
now 
there 
must 
be 
a 
necessary, 
visible 
connection 
between 
virtue 
and 
knowledge, 
faith 
and 
morality; 
now 
the 
transcendental 
justice 
of 
Aeschylus 
is 
degraded 
to 
the 
superficial 
and 
insolent 
principle 
of 
“poetic 
justice” 
with 
its 
customary 
deus 
ex 
machina.2 


As 
it 
confronts 
this 
new 
Socratic-optimistic 
stage 
world, 
how 
does 
the 
chorus 
appear 
now, 
and 
indeed 
the 
whole 
musical-Dionysian 
substratum 
of 
tragedy? 
As 
something 
accidental, 
a 
dispensable 
vestige 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
tragedy; 
while 
we 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
chorus 
can 
be 
understood 
only 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
tragedy, 
and 
of 
the 
tragic 
in 
general. 
This 
perplexity 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
chorus 
already 
manifests 
itself 
in 
Sophocles—an 
important 
indication 
that 
even 
with 
him 
the 
Dionysian 
basis 
of 
tragedy 
is 
beginning 
to 
break 
down. 
He 
no 
longer 
dares 
to 
entrust 
to 
the 
chorus 
the 
main 
share 
of 
the 
effect, 
but 
limits 
its 
sphere 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
it 
now 
appears 
almost 
co-ordinate 
with 
the 
actors, 
just 
as 
if 
it 
were 
elevated 
from 
the 
orchestra 
into 
the 
scene; 
and 
thus 
its 
character 
is, 
of 
course, 
completely 
destroyed, 
even 
if 
Aristotle 
favors 
precisely 
this 
theory 
of 
the 
chorus. 
This 
alteration 
in 
the 
position 
of 
the 
chorus, 
which 
Sophocles 
at 
any 
rate 
recommended 
by 
his 
practice 
and, 
according 
to 
tradition, 
even 
by 
a 
treatise, 
is 
the 
first 
step 
toward 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
chorus, 
whose 
phases 
follow 
one 
another 
with 
alarming 
rapidity 
in 
Euripides, 
Agathon, 
and 
the 
New 
Comedy. 
Optimistic 
dialectic 
drives 
music 
out 
of 
tragedy 
with 
the 
scourge 
of 
its 
syllogisms; 
that 
is, 
it 
destroys 
the 
essence 
of 
tragedy, 
which 
can 
be 
interpreted 
only 
as 
a 
manifestation 
and 
projection 
into 
images 
of 
Dionysian 
states, 
as 
the 
visible 
symbolizing 
of 
music, 
as 
the 
dream-world 
of 
a 
Dionysian 
intoxication. 


If 
we 
must 
thus 
assume 
an 
anti-Dionysian 
tendency 
operating 
even 
prior 
to 
Socrates, 
which 
merely 
received 
in 
him 
an 
unprece-dentedly 
magnificent 
expression, 
we 
must 
not 
draw 
back 
before 
the 
question 
of 
what 
such 
a 
phenomenon 
as 
that 
of 
Socrates 
indicates; 
for 
in 
view 
of 
the 
Platonic 
dialogues 
we 
are 
certainly 
not 
entitled 
to 
regard 
it 
as 
a 
merely 
disintegrating, 
negative 
force. 
And 
though 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
most 
immediate 
effect 
of 
the 
Socratic 
impulse 
tended 
to 
the 
dissolution 
of 
Dionysian 
tragedy, 
yet 
a 
profound 
experience 
in 
Socrates’ 
own 
life 
impels 
us 
to 
ask 
whether 
there 
is 
necessarily 
only 
an 
antipodal 
relation 
between 
Socratism 
and 
art, 
and 
whether 
the 
birth 
of 
an 
“artistic 
Socrates” 
is 
altogether 
a 
contradiction 
in 
terms. 


For 
with 
respect 
to 
art 
that 
despotic 
logician 
occasionally 
had 
the 
feeling 
of 
a 
gap, 
a 
void, 
half 
a 
reproach, 
a 
possibly 
neglected 
duty. 
As 
he 
tells 
his 



friends 
in 
prison, 
there 
often 
came 
to 
him 
one 
and 
the 
same 
dream 
apparition, 
which 
always 
said 
the 
same 
thing 
to 
him: 
“Socrates, 
practice 
music.” 
Up 
to 
his 
very 
last 
days 
he 
comforts 
himself 
with 
the 
view 
that 
his 
philosophizing 
is 
the 
highest 
of 
the 
muses, 
and 
he 
finds 
it 
hard 
to 
believe 
that 
a 
deity 
should 
remind 
him 
of 
the 
“common, 
popular 
music.” 
Finally, 
in 
prison, 
in 
order 
that 
he 
may 
thoroughly 
unburden 
his 
conscience, 
he 
does 
consent 
to 
practice 
this 
music 
for 
which 
he 
has 
but 
little 
respect. 
And 
in 
this 
mood 
he 
writes 
a 
prelude 
to 
Apollo 
and 
turns 
a 
few 
Aesopian 
fables 
into 
verse. 
It 
was 
something 
akin 
to 
the 
demonic 
warning 
voice 
that 
urged 
him 
to 
these 
practices; 
it 
was 
his 
Apollinian 
insight 
that, 
like 
a 
barbaric 
king, 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
the 
noble 
image 
of 
a 
god 
and 
was 
in 
danger 
of 
sinning 
against 
a 
deity—through 
his 
lack 
of 
understanding. 
The 
voice 
of 
the 
Socratic 
dream 
vision 
is 
the 
only 
sign 
of 
any 
misgivings 
about 
the 
limits 
of 
logic: 
Perhaps— 
thus 
he 
must 
have 
asked 
himself—what 
is 
not 
intelligible 
to 
me 
is 
not 
necessarily 
unintelligent? 
Perhaps 
there 
is 
a 
realm 
of 
wisdom 
from 
which 
the 
logician 
is 
exiled? 
Perhaps 
art 
is 
even 
a 
necessary 
correlative 
of, 
and 
supplement 
for 
science? 



15 


In 
the 
spirit 
of 
these 
last 
suggestive 
questions 
it 
must 
now 
be 
said 
how 
the 
influence 
of 
Socrates, 
down 
to 
the 
present 
moment 
and 
even 
into 
all 
future 
time, 
has 
spread 
over 
posterity 
like 
a 
shadow 
that 
keeps 
growing 
in 
the 
evening 
sun, 
and 
how 
it 
again 
and 
again 
prompts 
a 
regeneration 
of 
art—of 
art 
in 
the 
metaphysical, 
broadest 
and 
profoundest 
sense—and 
how 
its 
own 
infinity 
also 
guarantees 
the 
infinity 
of 
art. 


Before 
this 
could 
be 
recognized, 
before 
the 
innermost 
dependence 
of 
every 
art 
on 
the 
Greeks, 
from 
Homer 
to 
Socrates, 
was 
demonstrated 
conclusively, 
we 
had 
to 
feel 
about 
these 
Greeks 
as 
the 
Athenians 
felt 
about 
Socrates. 
Nearly 
every 
age 
and 
stage 
of 
culture 
has 
at 
some 
time 
or 
other 
sought 
with 
profound 
irritation 
to 
free 
itself 
from 
the 
Greeks, 
because 
in 
their 
presence 
everything 
one 
has 
achieved 
oneself, 
though 
apparently 
quite 
original 
and 
sincerely 
admired, 
suddenly 
seemed 
to 
lose 
life 
and 
color 
and 
shriveled 
into 
a 
poor 
copy, 
even 
a 
caricature. 
And 
so 
time 
after 
time 
cordial 
anger 
erupts 
against 
this 
presumptuous 
little 
people 
that 
made 
bold 
for 
all 
time 
to 
designate 
everything 
not 
native 
as 
“barbaric.” 
Who 
are 
they, 
one 
asks, 
who, 
though 
they 
display 
only 
an 
ephemeral 
historical 
splendor, 
ridiculously 
restricted 
institutions, 
a 
dubious 
excellence 
in 
their 
mores, 
and 
are 
marked 
by 
ugly 
vices, 
yet 
lay 
claim 
to 
that 
dignity 
and 
pre-eminence 
among 
peoples 
which 
characterize 
genius 
among 
the 
masses? 
Unfortunately, 
one 
was 
not 
lucky 
enough 
to 
find 
the 
cup 
of 
hemlock 
with 
which 
one 
could 
simply 
dispose 
of 
such 
a 
character; 
for 
all 
the 
poison 
that 
envy, 
calumny, 
and 
rancor 
created 
did 
not 
suffice 
to 
destroy 
that 
self-sufficient 
splendor. 
And 
so 
one 
feels 
ashamed 
and 
afraid 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
unless 
one 
prizes 
truth 
above 
all 
things 
and 
dares 
acknowledge 
even 
this 
truth: 
that 
the 
Greeks, 
as 
charioteers, 
hold 
in 
their 
hands 
the 
reins 
of 
our 
own 
and 
every 
other 
culture, 
but 
that 
almost 
always 
chariot 
and 
horses 
are 
of 
inferior 
quality 
and 
not 
up 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
their 
leaders, 
who 
consider 
it 
sport 
to 
run 
such 
a 
team 
into 
an 
abyss 
which 
they 
themselves 
clear 
with 
the 
leap 
of 
Achilles. 


In 
order 
to 
vindicate 
the 
dignity 
of 
such 
a 
leader’s 
position 
for 
Socrates, 
too, 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
recognize 
in 
him 
a 
type 
of 
existence 
unheard 
of 
before 
him: 
the 
type 
of 
the 
theoretical 
man 
whose 
significance 
and 
aim 
it 
is 
our 
next 



task 
to 
try 
to 
understand. 
Like 
the 
artist, 
the 
theoretical 
man 
finds 
an 
infinite 
delight 
in 
whatever 
exists, 
and 
this 
satisfaction 
protects 
him 
against 
the 
practical 
ethics 
of 
pessimism 
with 
its 
Lynceus 
eyes1 
that 
shine 
only 
in 
the 
dark. 
Whenever 
the 
truth 
is 
uncovered, 
the 
artist 
will 
always 
cling 
with 
rapt 
gaze 
to 
what 
still 
remains 
covering2 
even 
after 
such 
uncovering; 
but 
the 
theoretical 
man 
enjoys 
and 
finds 
satisfaction 
in 
the 
discarded 
covering 
and 
finds 
the 
highest 
object 
of 
his 
pleasure 
in 
the 
process 
of 
an 
ever 
happy 
uncovering 
that 
succeeds 
through 
his 
own 
efforts. 


There 
would 
be 
no 
science 
if 
it 
were 
concerned 
only 
with 
that 
one 
nude 
goddess 
and 
with 
nothing 
else. 
For 
in 
that 
case 
her 
devotees 
would 
have 
to 
feel 
like 
men 
who 
wanted 
to 
dig 
a 
hole 
straight 
through 
the 
earth, 
assuming 
that 
each 
of 
them 
realized 
that 
even 
if 
he 
tried 
his 
utmost, 
his 
whole 
life 
long, 
he 
would 
only 
be 
able 
to 
dig 
a 
very 
small 
portion 
of 
this 
enormous 
depth, 
and 
even 
that 
would 
be 
filled 
in 
again 
before 
his 
own 
eyes 
by 
the 
labors 
of 
the 
next 
in 
line, 
so 
a 
third 
person 
would 
seem 
to 
do 
well 
if 
he 
picked 
a 
new 
spot 
for 
his 
drilling 
efforts. 
Now 
suppose 
someone 
proved 
convincingly 
that 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
antipodes 
cannot 
be 
reached 
in 
this 
direct 
manner: 
who 
would 
still 
wish 
to 
go 
on 
working 
in 
these 
old 
depths, 
unless 
he 
had 
learned 
meanwhile 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
finding 
precious 
stones 
or 
discovering 
laws 
of 
nature? 


Therefore 
Lessing, 
the 
most 
honest 
theoretical 
man, 
dared 
to 
announce 
that 
he 
cared 
more 
for 
the 
search 
after 
truth 
than 
for 
truth 
itself3 
—and 
thus 
revealed 
the 
fundamental 
secret 
of 
science, 
to 
the 
astonishment, 
and 
indeed 
the 
anger, 
of 
the 
scientific 
community. 
Beside 
this 
isolated 
insight, 
born 
of 
an 
excess 
of 
honesty 
if 
not 
of 
exuberance, 
there 
is, 
to 
be 
sure, 
a 
profound 
illusion 
that 
first 
saw 
the 
light 
of 
the 
world 
in 
the 
person 
of 
Socrates: 
the 
unshakable 
faith 
that 
thought, 
using 
the 
thread 
of 
causality, 
can 
penetrate 
the 
deepest 
abysses 
of 
being, 
and 
that 
thought 
is 
capable 
not 
only 
of 
knowing 
being 
but 
even 
of 
correcting 
it. 
This 
sublime 
metaphysical 
illusion 
accompanies 
science 
as 
an 
instinct 
and 
leads 
science 
again 
and 
again 
to 
its 
limits 
at 
which 
it 
must 
turn 
into 
art—which 
is 
really 
the 
aim 
of 
this 
mechanism. 


With 
the 
torch 
of 
this 
thought 
in 
our 
hands, 
let 
us 
now 
look 
at 
Socrates: 
he 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
first 
who 
could 
not 
only 
live, 
guided 
by 
this 
instinct 
of 
science, 
but 
also—and 
this 
is 
far 
more—die 
that 
way. 
Hence 
the 
image 
of 
the 
dying 
Socrates, 
as 
the 
human 
being 
whom 
knowledge 
and 
reasons 
have 
liberated 
from 
the 
fear 
of 
death, 
is 
the 
emblem 
that, 
above 
the 
entrance 
gate 
of 
science, 
reminds 
all 
of 
its 
mission—namely, 
to 
make 
existence 
appear 



comprehensible 
and 
thus 
justified; 
and 
if 
reasons 
do 
not 
suffice, 
myth 
has 
to 
come 
to 
their 
aid 
in 
the 
end—myth 
which 
I 
have 
just 
called 
the 
necessary 
consequence, 
indeed 
the 
purpose, 
of 
science. 


Once 
we 
see 
clearly 
how 
after 
Socrates, 
the 
mystagogue 
of 
science, 
one 
philosophical 
school 
succeeds 
another, 
wave 
upon 
wave; 
how 
the 
hunger 
for 
knowledge 
reached 
a 
never-suspected 
universality 
in 
the 
widest 
domain 
of 
the 
educated 
world, 
became 
the 
real 
task 
for 
every 
person 
of 
higher 
gifts, 
and 
led 
science 
onto 
the 
high 
seas 
from 
which 
it 
has 
never 
again 
been 
driven 
altogether; 
how 
this 
universality 
first 
spread 
a 
common 
net 
of 
thought 
over 
the 
whole 
globe, 
actually 
holding 
out 
the 
prospect 
of 
the 
lawfulness 
of 
an 
entire 
solar 
system; 
once 
we 
see 
all 
this 
clearly, 
along 
with 
the 
amazingly 
high 
pyramid 
of 
knowledge 
in 
our 
own 
time—we 
cannot 
fail 
to 
see 
in 
Socrates 
the 
one 
turning 
point 
and 
vortex 
of 
so-called 
world 
history. 
For 
if 
we 
imagine 
that 
the 
whole 
incalculable 
sum 
of 
energy 
used 
up 
for 
this 
world 
tendency 
had 
been 
used 
not 
in 
the 
service 
of 
knowledge 
but 
for 
the 
practical, 
i.e., 
egoistic 
aims 
of 
individuals 
and 
peoples, 
then 
we 
realize 
that 
in 
that 
case 
universal 
wars 
of 
annihilation 
and 
continual 
migrations 
of 
peoples 
would 
probably 
have 
weakened 
the 
instinctive 
lust 
for 
life 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
suicide 
would 
have 
become 
a 
general 
custom 
and 
individuals 
might 
have 
experienced 
the 
final 
remnant 
of 
a 
sense 
of 
duty 
when, 
like 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
Fiji 
Islands, 
they 
had 
strangled 
their 
parents 
and 
friends—a 
practical 
pessimism 
that 
might 
even 
have 
generated 
a 
gruesome 
ethic 
of 
genocide4 
motivated 
by 
pity, 
and 
which 
incidentally 
is, 
and 
was, 
present 
in 
the 
world 
wherever 
art 
did 
not 
appear 
in 
some 
form—especially 
as 
religion 
and 
science 
—as 
a 
remedy 
and 
a 
preventive 
for 
this 
breath 
of 
pestilence. 


By 
contrast 
with 
this 
practical 
pessimism, 
Socrates 
is 
the 
prototype 
of 
the 
theoretical 
optimist 
who, 
with 
his 
faith 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
can 
be 
fathomed, 
ascribes 
to 
knowledge 
and 
insight 
the 
power 
of 
a 
panacea, 
while 
understanding 
error 
as 
the 
evil 
par 
excellence. 
To 
fathom 
the 
depths 
and 
to 
separate 
true 
knowledge 
from 
appearance 
and 
error, 
seemed 
to 
Socratic 
man 
the 
noblest, 
even 
the 
only 
truly 
human 
vocation. 
And 
since 
Socrates, 
this 
mechanism 
of 
concepts, 
judgments, 
and 
inferences 
has 
been 
esteemed 
as 
the 
highest 
occupation 
and 
the 
most 
admirable 
gift 
of 
nature, 
above 
all 
other 
capacities. 
Even 
the 
most 
sublime 
ethical 
deeds, 
the 
stirrings 
of 
pity, 
self-
sacrifice, 
heroism, 
and 
that 
calm 
sea 
of 
the 
soul, 
so 
difficult 
to 
attain, 
which 
the 
Apollinian 
Greek 
called 
sophrosune,5 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
dialectic 
of 
knowledge 
by 
Socrates 
and 
his 
like-minded 
successors, 
down 
to 
the 
present, 



and 
accordingly 
designated 
as 
teachable. 


Anyone 
who 
has 
ever 
experienced 
the 
pleasure 
of 
Socratic 
insight 
and 
felt 
how, 
spreading 
in 
ever-widening 
circles, 
it 
seeks 
to 
embrace 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
appearances, 
will 
never 
again 
find 
any 
stimulus 
toward 
existence 
more 
violent 
than 
the 
craving 
to 
complete 
this 
conquest 
and 
to 
weave 
the 
net 
impenetrably 
tight. 
To 
one 
who 
feels 
that 
way, 
the 
Platonic 
Socrates 
will 
appear 
as 
the 
teacher 
of 
an 
altogether 
new 
form 
of 
“Greek 
cheerfulness” 
and 
blissful 
affirmation 
of 
existence 
that 
seeks 
to 
discharge 
itself 
in 
actions— 
most 
often 
in 
maieutic 
and 
educational 
influences 
on 
noble 
youths, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
eventually 
producing 
a 
genius. 


But 
science, 
spurred 
by 
its 
powerful 
illusion, 
speeds 
irresistibly 
toward 
its 
limits 
where 
its 
optimism, 
concealed 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
logic, 
suffers 
shipwreck. 
For 
the 
periphery 
of 
the 
circle 
of 
science 
has 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
points; 
and 
while 
there 
is 
no 
telling 
how 
this 
circle 
could 
ever 
be 
surveyed 
completely, 
noble 
and 
gifted 
men 
nevertheless 
reach, 
e’er 
half 
their 
time6 
and 
inevitably, 
such 
boundary 
points7 
on 
the 
periphery 
from 
which 
one 
gazes 
into 
what 
defies 
illumination. 
When 
they 
see 
to 
their 
horror 
how 
logic 
coils 
up 
at 
these 
boundaries 
and 
finally 
bites 
its 
own 
tail—suddenly 
the 
new 
form 
of 
insight 
breaks 
through, 
tragic 
insight 
which, 
merely 
to 
be 
endured, 
needs 
art 
as 
a 
protection 
and 
remedy. 


Our 
eyes 
strengthened 
and 
refreshed 
by 
our 
contemplation 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
highest 
spheres 
of 
the 
world 
around 
us; 
then 
we 
shall 
see 
how 
the 
hunger 
for 
insatiable 
and 
optimistic 
knowledge8 
that 
in 
Socrates 
appears 
exemplary 
has 
turned 
into 
tragic 
resignation 
and 
destitute 
need 
for 
art 
—while, 
to 
be 
sure, 
the 
same 
hunger 
on 
its 
lower 
levels 
can 
express 
itself 
in 
hostility 
to 
art 
and 
must 
particularly 
detest 
Dionysian-tragic 
art, 
as 
was 
illustrated 
earlier 
with 
the 
fight 
of 
Socratism 
against 
Aeschylean 
tragedy. 


Here 
we 
knock, 
deeply 
moved, 
at 
the 
gates 
of 
present 
and 
future: 
will 
this 
“turning”9 
lead 
to 
ever-new 
configurations 
of 
genius 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
Socrates 
who 
practices 
music?10 
Will 
the 
net 
of 
art, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
called 
religion 
or 
science, 
that 
is 
spread 
over 
existence 
be 
woven 
even 
more 
tightly 
and 
delicately, 
or 
is 
it 
destined 
to 
be 
torn 
to 
shreds 
in 
the 
restless, 
barbarous, 
chaotic 
whirl 
that 
now 
calls 
itself 
“the 
present”? 


Concerned 
but 
not 
disconsolate, 
we 
stand 
aside 
a 
little 
while, 
contemplative 
men 
to 
whom 
it 
has 
been 
granted 
to 
be 
witnesses 
of 
these 
tremendous 
struggles 
and 
transitions. 
Alas, 
it 
is 
the 
magic 
of 
these 
struggles 
that 
those 
who 
behold 
them 
must 
also 
take 
part 
and 
fight.11 



16 


By 
this 
elaborate 
historical 
example 
we 
have 
sought 
to 
make 
clear 
how 
just 
as 
tragedy 
perishes 
with 
the 
evanescence 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
music, 
it 
is 
only 
from 
this 
spirit 
that 
it 
can 
be 
reborn. 
Lest 
this 
assertion 
seem 
too 
strange, 
it 
may 
be 
well 
to 
disclose 
the 
origin 
of 
this 
insight 
by 
considering 
the 
analogous 
phenomena 
of 
our 
own 
time; 
we 
must 
enter 
into 
the 
midst 
of 
those 
struggles, 
which, 
as 
I 
have 
just 
said, 
are 
being 
waged 
in 
the 
highest 
spheres 
of 
our 
contemporary 
world 
between 
insatiable 
optimistic 
knowledge 
and 
the 
tragic 
need 
of 
art. 
In 
my 
examination 
I 
shall 
leave 
out 
of 
account 
all 
those 
other 
antagonistic 
tendencies 
which 
at 
all 
times 
oppose 
art, 
especially 
tragedy, 
and 
which 
now 
are 
again 
extending 
their 
triumphant 
sway 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
of 
the 
theatrical 
arts 
only 
the 
farce 
and 
the 
ballet, 
for 
example, 
put 
forth 
their 
blossoms, 
which 
perhaps 
not 
everyone 
cares 
to 
smell, 
in 
rather 
rich 
luxuriance. 
I 
will 
speak 
only 
of 
the 
noblest 
opposition 
to 
the 
tragic 
worldconception—
and 
by 
this 
I 
mean 
science, 
which 
is 
at 
bottom 
optimistic, 
with 
its 
ancestor 
Socrates 
at 
its 
head. 
A 
little 
later 
on 
I 
shall 
also 
name 
those 
forces 
which 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
guarantee 
a 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy—and 
perhaps 
other 
blessed 
hopes 
for 
the 
German 
genius! 


Before 
we 
plunge 
into 
the 
midst 
of 
these 
struggles, 
let 
us 
array 
ourselves 
in 
the 
armor 
of 
the 
insights 
we 
have 
acquired. 
In 
contrast 
to 
all 
those 
who 
are 
intent 
on 
deriving 
the 
arts 
from 
one 
exclusive 
principle, 
as 
the 
necessary 
vital 
source 
of 
every 
work 
of 
art, 
I 
shall 
keep 
my 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
the 
two 
artistic 
deities 
of 
the 
Greeks, 
Apollo 
and 
Dionysus, 
and 
recognize 
in 
them 
the 
living 
and 
conspicuous 
representatives 
of 
two 
worlds 
of 
art 
differing 
in 
their 
intrinsic 
essence 
and 
in 
their 
highest 
aims. 
I 
see 
Apollo 
as 
the 
transfiguring 
genius 
of 
the 
principium 
individuationis 
through 
which 
alone 
the 
redemption 
in 
illusion 
is 
truly 
to 
be 
obtained; 
while 
by 
the 
mystical 
triumphant 
cry 
of 
Dionysus 
the 
spell 
of 
individuation 
is 
broken, 
and 
the 
way 
lies 
open 
to 
the 
Mothers 
of 
Being,1 
to 
the 
innermost 
heart 
of 
things. 
This 
extraordinary 
contrast, 
which 
stretches 
like 
a 
yawning 
gulf 
between 
plastic 
art 
as 
the 
Apollinian, 
and 
music 
as 
the 
Dionysian 
art,2 
has 
revealed 
itself 
to 
only 
one 
of 
the 
great 
thinkers, 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that, 
even 
without 
this 
clue 
to 
the 



symbolism 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
divinities, 
he 
conceded 
to 
music 
a 
character 
and 
an 
origin 
different 
from 
all 
the 
other 
arts, 
because, 
unlike 
them, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
phenomenon, 
but 
an 
immediate 
copy 
of 
the 
will 
itself, 
and 
therefore 
complements 
everything 
physical 
in 
the 
world 
and 
every 
phenomenon 
by 
representing 
what 
is 
metaphysical, 
the 
thing 
in 
itself. 
(Schopenhauer, 
Welt 
als 
Wille 
und 
Vorstellung, 
I, 
p. 
310.) 


To 
this 
most 
important 
insight 
of 
aesthetics 
(with 
which, 
in 
the 
most 
serious 
sense, 
aesthetics 
properly 
begins), 
Richard 
Wagner, 
by 
way 
of 
confirmation 
of 
its 
eternal 
truth, 
affixed 
his 
seal, 
when 
he 
asserted 
in 
his 
Beethoven 
that 
music 
must 
be 
evaluated 
according 
to 
aesthetic 
principles 
quite 
different 
from 
those 
which 
apply 
to 
all 
plastic 
arts, 
and 
not, 
in 
general, 
according 
to 
the 
category 
of 
beauty; 
although 
an 
erroneous 
aesthetics, 
inspired 
by 
a 
mistaken 
and 
degenerate 
art,3 
has, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
beauty 
obtaining 
in 
the 
plastic 
domain, 
accustomed 
itself 
to 
demand 
of 
music 
an 
effect 
similar 
to 
that 
produced 
by 
works 
of 
plastic 
art, 
namely, 
the 
arousing 
of 
delight 
in 
beautiful 
forms. 
Having 
recognized 
this 
extraordinary 
contrast, 
I 
felt 
a 
strong 
need 
to 
approach 
the 
essence 
of 
Greek 
tragedy 
and, 
with 
it, 
the 
profoundest 
revelation 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
genius; 
for 
I 
at 
last 
thought 
that 
I 
possessed 
a 
charm 
to 
enable 
me—far 
beyond 
the 
phraseology 
of 
our 
usual 
aesthetics—to 
represent 
vividly 
to 
my 
mind 
the 
fundamental 
problem 
of 
tragedy; 
whereby 
I 
was 
granted 
such 
a 
surprising 
and 
unusual 
insight 
into 
the 
Hellenic 
character 
that 
it 
necessarily 
seemed 
to 
me 
as 
if 
our 
classical-
Hellenic 
science 
that 
bears 
itself 
so 
proudly 
had 
thus 
far 
contrived 
to 
subsist 
mainly 
on 
shadow 
plays 
and 
externals. 


Perhaps 
we 
may 
touch 
on 
this 
fundamental 
problem 
by 
asking: 
what 
aesthetic 
effect 
results 
when 
the 
essentially 
separate 
art-forces, 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian, 
enter 
into 
simultaneous 
activity? 
Or 
more 
briefly: 
how 
is 
music 
related 
to 
image 
and 
concept? 
Schopenhauer, 
whom 
Richard 
Wagner, 
with 
special 
reference 
to 
this 
point, 
praises 
for 
an 
unsurpassable 
clearness 
and 
clarity 
of 
exposition, 
expresses 
himself 
most 
thoroughly 
on 
the 
subject 
in 
the 
following 
passage 
which 
I 
shall 
cite 
here 
at 
full 
length 
(Welt 
als 
Wille 
und 
Vorstellung, 
I, 
p. 
p. 
3094): 
“According 
to 
all 
this, 
we 
may 
regard 
the 
phenomenal 
world, 
or 
nature, 
and 
music 
as 
two 
different 
expressions 
of 
the 
same 
thing,5 
which 
is 
therefore 
itself 
the 
only 
medium 
of 
their 
analogy, 
so 
that 
a 
knowledge 
of 
it 
is 
demanded 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
that 
analogy. 
Music, 
therefore, 
if 
regarded 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
world, 
is 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
a 
universal 
language, 
which 
is 
related 
indeed 
to 
the 
universality 
of 



concepts, 
much 
as 
they 
are 
related 
to 
the 
particular 
things. 
Its 
universality, 
however, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
that 
empty 
universality 
of 
abstraction, 
but 
of 
quite 
a 
different 
kind, 
and 
is 
united 
with 
thorough 
and 
distinct 
definiteness. 
In 
this 
respect 
it 
resembles 
geometrical 
figures 
and 
numbers, 
which 
are 
the 
universal 
forms 
of 
all 
possible 
objects 
of 
experience 
and 
applicable 
to 
them 
all 
a 
priori, 
and 
yet 
are 
not 
abstract 
but 
perceptible 
and 
thoroughly 
determinate. 
All 
possible 
efforts, 
excitements, 
and 
manifestations 
of 
will, 
all 
that 
goes 
on 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
man 
and 
that 
reason 
includes 
in 
the 
wide, 
negative 
concept 
of 
feeling, 
may 
be 
expressed 
by 
the 
infinite 
number 
of 
possible 
melodies, 
but 
always 
in 
the 
universal, 
in 
the 
mere 
form, 
without 
the 
material, 
always 
according 
to 
the 
thing-in-itself, 
not 
the 
phenomenon, 
the 
inmost 
soul, 
as 
it 
were, 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
without 
the 
body. 
This 
deep 
relation 
which 
music 
has 
to 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
all 
things 
also 
explains 
the 
fact 
that 
suitable 
music 
played 
to 
any 
scene, 
action, 
event, 
or 
surrounding 
seems 
to 
disclose 
to 
us 
its 
most 
secret 
meaning, 
and 
appears 
as 
the 
most 
accurate 
and 
distinct 
commentary 
upon 
it. 
This 
is 
so 
truly 
the 
case 
that 
whoever 
gives 
himself 
up 
entirely 
to 
the 
impression 
of 
a 
symphony, 
seems 
to 
see 
all 
the 
possible 
events 
of 
life 
and 
the 
world 
take 
place 
in 
himself; 
yet 
if 
he 
reflects, 
he 
can 
find 
no 
likeness 
between 
the 
music 
and 
the 
things 
that 
passed 
before 
his 
mind. 
For, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
music 
is 
distinguished 
from 
all 
the 
other 
arts 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
phenomenon, 
or, 
more 
accurately, 
of 
the 
adequate 
objectivity 
of 
the 
will, 
but 
an 
immediate 
copy 
of 
the 
will 
itself, 
and 
therefore 
complements 
everything 
physical 
in 
the 
world 
and 
every 
phenomenon 
by 
representing 
what 
is 
metaphysical, 
the 
thing 
in 
itself. 
We 
might, 
therefore, 
just 
as 
well 
call 
the 
world 
embodied 
music 
as 
embodied 
will; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
music 
makes 
every 
painting, 
and 
indeed 
every 
scene 
of 
real 
life 
and 
of 
the 
world, 
at 
once 
appear 
with 
higher 
significance, 
certainly 
all 
the 
more, 
in 
proportion 
as 
its 
melody 
is 
analogous 
to 
the 
inner 
spirit 
of 
the 
given 
phenomenon. 
Therefore 
we 
are 
able 
to 
set 
a 
poem 
to 
music 
as 
a 
song, 
or 
a 
visible 
representation 
as 
a 
pantomime, 
or 
both 
as 
an 
opera. 
Such 
particular 
pictures 
of 
human 
life, 
set 
to 
the 
universal 
language 
of 
music, 
are 
never 
bound 
to 
it 
or 
correspond 
to 
it 
with 
stringent 
necessity; 
but 
they 
stand 
to 
it 
only 
in 
the 
relation 
of 
an 
example 
chosen 
at 
will 
to 
a 
general 
concept. 
In 
the 
determinateness 
of 
the 
real, 
they 
represent 
that 
which 
music 
expresses 
in 
the 
universality 
of 
mere 
form. 
For 
melodies 
are 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
like 
general 
concepts, 
an 
abstraction 
from 
the 
actual. 
This 
actual 
world, 
then, 
the 
world 
of 
particular 
things, 
affords 
the 
object 
of 
perception, 
the 
special 
and 
individual, 



the 
particular 
case, 
both 
to 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
concepts 
and 
to 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
melodies. 
But 
these 
two 
universalities 
are 
in 
a 
certain 
respect 
opposed 
to 
each 
other; 
for 
the 
concepts 
contain 
particulars 
only 
as 
the 
first 
forms 
abstracted 
from 
perception, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
separated 
shell 
of 
things; 
thus 
they 
are, 
strictly 
speaking, 
abstracta: 
music, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
gives 
the 
inmost 
kernel 
which 
precedes 
all 
forms, 
or 
the 
heart 
of 
things. 
This 
relation 
may 
be 
very 
well 
expressed 
in 
the 
language 
of 
the 
schoolmen, 
by 
saying, 
the 
concepts 
are 
the 
universalia 
post 
rem, 
but 
music 
gives 
the 
universalia 
ante 
rem, 
and 
the 
real 
world 
the 
universalia 
in 
re. 
But 
that 
in 
general 
a 
relation 
is 
possible 
between 
a 
composition 
and 
a 
visible 
representation 
rests, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
upon 
the 
fact 
that 
both 
are 
simply 
different 
expressions 
of 
the 
same 
inner 
being 
of 
the 
world. 
When 
now, 
in 
the 
particular 
case, 
such 
a 
relation 
is 
actually 
given, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
the 
composer 
has 
been 
able 
to 
express 
in 
the 
universal 
language 
of 
music 
the 
stirrings 
of 
will 
which 
constitute 
the 
heart 
of 
an 
event, 
then 
the 
melody 
of 
the 
song, 
the 
music 
of 
the 
opera, 
is 
expressive. 
But 
the 
analogy 
discovered 
by 
the 
composer 
between 
the 
two 
must 
have 
proceeded 
from 
the 
direct 
knowledge 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
world 
unknown 
to 
his 
reason, 
and 
must 
not 
be 
an 
imitation 
produced 
with 
conscious 
intention 
by 
means 
of 
concepts, 
otherwise 
the 
music 
does 
not 
express 
the 
inner 
nature, 
the 
will 
itself, 
but 
merely 
gives 
an 
inadequate 
imitation 
of 
its 
phenomenon. 
All 
truly 
imitative 
music 
does 
this.” 


According 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Schopenhauer, 
therefore, 
we 
understand 
music 
as 
the 
immediate 
language 
of 
the 
will, 
and 
we 
feel 
our 
fancy 
stimulated 
to 
give 
form 
to 
this 
invisible 
and 
yet 
so 
actively 
stirred 
spirit-world 
which 
speaks 
to 
us, 
and 
we 
feel 
prompted 
to 
embody 
it 
in 
an 
analogous 
example. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
image 
and 
concept, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
truly 
corresponding 
music, 
acquire 
a 
higher 
significance. 
Dionysian 
art 
therefore 
is 
wont 
to 
exercise 
two 
kinds 
of 
influences 
on 
the 
Apollinian 
art 
faculty: 
music 
incites 
to 
the 
symbolic 
intuition 
of 
Dionysian 
universality, 
and 
music 
allows 
the 
symbolic 
image 
to 
emerge 
in 
its 
highest 
significance. 
From 
these 
facts, 
intelligible 
in 
themselves 
and 
not 
inaccessible 
to 
a 
more 
penetrating 
examination, 
I 
infer 
the 
capacity 
of 
music 
to 
give 
birth 
to 
myth 
(the 
most 
significant 
example), 
and 
particularly 
the 
tragic 
myth: 
the 
myth 
which 
expresses 
Dionysian 
knowledge 
in 
symbols. 
In 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
lyrist, 
I 
have 
shown 
how 
music 
strives 
to 
express 
its 
nature 
in 
Apollinian 
images. 
If 
now 
we 
reflect 
that 
music 
at 
its 
highest 
stage 
must 
seek 
to 
attain 
also 
to 
its 



highest 
objectification 
in 
images, 
we 
must 
deem 
it 
possible 
that 
it 
also 
knows 
how 
to 
find 
the 
symbolic 
expression 
for 
its 
unique 
Dionysian 
wisdom; 
and 
where 
shall 
we 
seek 
for 
this 
expression 
if 
not 
in 
tragedy 
and, 
in 
general, 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
tragic? 


From 
the 
nature 
of 
art 
as 
it 
is 
usually 
conceived 
according 
to 
the 
single 
category 
of 
appearance 
and 
beauty, 
the 
tragic 
cannot 
honestly 
be 
deduced 
at 
all; 
it 
is 
only 
through 
the 
spirit 
of 
music 
that 
we 
can 
understand 
the 
joy 
involved 
in 
the 
annihilation 
of 
the 
individual. 
For 
it 
is 
only 
in 
particular 
examples 
of 
such 
annihilation 
that 
we 
see 
clearly 
the 
eternal 
phenomenon 
of 
Dionysian 
art, 
which 
gives 
expression 
to 
the 
will 
in 
its 
omnipotence, 
as 
it 
were, 
behind 
the 
principium 
individuationis, 
the 
eternal 
life 
beyond 
all 
phenomena, 
and 
despite 
all 
annihilation. 
The 
metaphysical 
joy 
in 
the 
tragic 
is 
a 
translation 
of 
the 
instinctive 
unconscious 
Dionysian 
wisdom 
into 
the 
language 
of 
images: 
the 
hero, 
the 
highest 
manifestation 
of 
the 
will, 
is 
negated 
for 
our 
pleasure, 
because 
he 
is 
only 
phenomenon, 
and 
because 
the 
eternal 
life 
of 
the 
will 
is 
not 
affected 
by 
his 
annihilation. 
“We 
believe 
in 
eternal 
life,” 
exclaims 
tragedy; 
while 
music 
is 
the 
immediate 
idea 
of 
this 
life. 
Plastic 
art 
has 
an 
altogether 
different 
aim: 
here 
Apollo 
overcomes 
the 
suffering 
of 
the 
individual 
by 
the 
radiant 
glorification 
of 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
phenomenon: 
here 
beauty 
triumphs 
over 
the 
suffering 
inherent 
in 
life; 
pain 
is 
obliterated 
by 
lies 
from 
the 
features 
of 
nature. 
In 
Dionysian 
art 
and 
its 
tragic 
symbolism 
the 
same 
nature 
cries 
to 
us 
with 
its 
true, 
undis-sembled 
voice: 
“Be 
as 
I 
am! 
Amid 
the 
ceaseless 
flux 
of 
phenomena 
I 
am 
the 
eternally 
creative 
primordial 
mother, 
eternally 
impelling 
to 
existence, 
eternally 
finding 
satisfaction 
in 
this 
change 
of 
phenomena!” 



17 


Dionysian 
art, 
too, 
wishes 
to 
convince 
us 
of 
the 
eternal 
joy 
of 
existence: 
only 
we 
are 
to 
seek 
this 
joy 
not 
in 
phenomena, 
but 
behind 
them. 
We 
are 
to 
recognize 
that 
all 
that 
comes 
into 
being 
must 
be 
ready 
for 
a 
sorrowful 
end; 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
look 
into 
the 
terrors 
of 
the 
individual 
existence—yet 
we 
are 
not 
to 
become 
rigid 
with 
fear: 
a 
metaphysical 
comfort 
tears 
us 
momentarily 
from 
the 
bustle 
of 
the 
changing 
figures. 
We 
are 
really 
for 
a 
brief 
moment 
primordial 
being 
itself, 
feeling 
its 
raging 
desire 
for 
existence 
and 
joy 
in 
existence; 
the 
struggle, 
the 
pain, 
the 
destruction 
of 
phenomena, 
now 
appear 
necessary 
to 
us, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
excess 
of 
countless 
forms 
of 
existence 
which 
force 
and 
push 
one 
another 
into 
life, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
exuberant 
fertility 
of 
the 
universal 
will. 
We 
are 
pierced 
by 
the 
maddening 
sting 
of 
these 
pains 
just 
when 
we 
have 
become, 
as 
it 
were, 
one 
with 
the 
infinite 
primordial 
joy 
in 
existence, 
and 
when 
we 
anticipate, 
in 
Dionysian 
ecstasy, 
the 
indestructibility 
and 
eternity 
of 
this 
joy. 
In 
spite 
of 
fear 
and 
pity, 
we 
are 
the 
happy 
living 
beings, 
not 
as 
individuals, 
but 
as 
the 
one 
living 
being, 
with 
whose 
creative 
joy 
we 
are 
united. 


The 
history 
of 
the 
rise 
of 
Greek 
tragedy 
now 
tells 
us 
with 
luminous 
precision 
how 
the 
tragic 
art 
of 
the 
Greeks 
was 
really 
born 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
music. 
With 
this 
conception 
we 
believe 
we 
have 
done 
justice 
for 
the 
first 
time 
to 
the 
primitive 
and 
astonishing 
significance 
of 
the 
chorus. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
however, 
we 
must 
admit 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
tragic 
myth 
set 
forth 
above 
never 
became 
clear 
in 
transparent 
concepts 
to 
the 
Greek 
poets, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
Greek 
philosophers: 
their 
heroes 
speak, 
as 
it 
were, 
more 
superficially 
than 
they 
act; 
the 
myth 
does 
not 
at 
all 
obtain 
adequate 
objectification 
in 
the 
spoken 
word. 
The 
structure 
of 
the 
scenes 
and 
the 
visual 
images 
reveal 
a 
deeper 
wisdom 
than 
the 
poet 
himself 
can 
put 
into 
words 
and 
concepts: 
the 
same 
is 
also 
observable 
in 
Shakespeare, 
whose 
Hamlet, 
for 
instance, 
similarly, 
talks 
more 
superficially 
than 
he 
acts, 
so 
that 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
lesson 
of 
Hamlet 
is 
to 
be 
deduced, 
not 
from 
his 
words, 
but 
from 
a 
profound 
contemplation 
and 
survey 
of 
the 
whole. 


With 
respect 
to 
Greek 
tragedy, 
which 
of 
course 
presents 
itself 
to 
us 
only 
as 
word-drama, 
I 
have 
even 
intimated 
that 
the 
lack 
of 
congruity 
between 
myth 



and 
expression 
might 
easily 
lead 
us 
to 
regard 
it 
as 
shallower 
and 
less 
significant 
than 
it 
really 
is, 
and 
accordingly 
to 
attribute 
to 
it 
a 
more 
superficial 
effect 
than 
it 
must 
have 
had 
according 
to 
the 
testimony 
of 
the 
ancients: 
for 
how 
easily 
one 
forgets 
that 
what 
the 
word-poet 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
doing, 
namely, 
attain 
the 
highest 
spiritualization 
and 
ideality 
of 
the 
myth, 
he 
might 
very 
well 
succeed 
in 
doing 
every 
moment 
as 
creative 
musician! 
To 
be 
sure, 
we 
are 
almost 
forced 
to 
construct 
for 
ourselves 
by 
scholarly 
research 
the 
superior 
power 
of 
the 
musical 
effect 
in 
order 
to 
experience 
something 
of 
the 
incomparable 
comfort 
which 
must 
have 
been 
characteristic 
of 
true 
tragedy. 
Even 
this 
musical 
superiority, 
however, 
would 
only 
have 
been 
felt 
by 
us 
had 
we 
been 
Greeks; 
for 
in 
the 
entire 
development 
of 
Greek 
music—as 
compared 
with 
the 
infinitely 
richer 
music 
known 
and 
familiar 
to 
us—we 
imagine 
we 
hear 
only 
the 
youthful 
song 
of 
the 
musical 
genius 
modestly 
intoned. 
The 
Greeks, 
as 
the 
Egyptian 
priests 
say, 
are 
eternal 
children, 
and 
in 
tragic 
art 
too 
they 
are 
only 
children 
who 
do 
not 
know 
what 
a 
sublime 
plaything 
originated 
in 
their 
hands 
and—was 
quickly 
demolished. 


That 
striving 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
music 
toward 
visual 
and 
mythical 
objectification, 
which 
increases 
from 
the 
beginnings 
of 
lyric 
poetry 
up 
to 
Attic 
tragedy, 
suddenly 
breaks 
off 
after 
attaining 
a 
luxuriant 
development, 
and 
disappears, 
as 
it 
were, 
from 
the 
surface 
of 
Hellenic 
art; 
while 
the 
Dionysian 
world 
view 
born 
of 
this 
striving 
lives 
on 
in 
the 
mysteries 
and, 
in 
its 
strangest 
metamorphoses 
and 
debasements, 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
attract 
serious 
natures. 
Will 
it 
not 
some 
day 
rise 
once 
again 
out 
of 
its 
mystic 
depths 
as 
art? 


Here 
we 
are 
detained 
by 
the 
question, 
whether 
the 
power, 
by 
virtue 
of 
whose 
opposing 
influence 
tragedy 
perished, 
has 
for 
all 
time 
sufficient 
strength 
to 
prevent 
the 
artistic 
reawakening 
of 
tragedy 
and 
the 
tragic 
world 
view. 
If 
ancient 
tragedy 
was 
diverted 
from 
its 
course 
by 
the 
dialectical 
desire 
for 
knowledge 
and 
the 
optimism 
of 
science, 
this 
fact 
might 
lead 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
an 
eternal 
conflict 
between 
the 
theoretic 
and 
the 
tragic 
world 
view; 
and 
only 
after 
the 
spirit 
of 
science 
has 
been 
pursued 
to 
its 
limits, 
and 
its 
claim 
to 
universal 
validity 
destroyed 
by 
the 
evidence 
of 
these 
limits 
may 
we 
hope 
for 
a 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy—a 
form 
of 
culture 
for 
which 
we 
should 
have 
to 
use 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
music-practicing 
Socrates 
in 
the 
sense 
spoken 
of 
above.1 
In 
this 
contrast, 
I 
understand 
by 
the 
spirit 
of 
science 
the 
faith 
that 
first 
came 
to 
light 
in 
the 
person 
of 
Socrates—the 
faith 
in 
the 
explicability 
of 
nature 
and 
in 
knowledge 
as 
a 
panacea. 


He 
who 
recalls 
the 
immediate 
consequences 
of 
this 
restlessly 
progressing 



spirit 
of 
science 
will 
realize 
at 
once 
that 
myth 
was 
annihilated 
by 
it, 
and 
that, 
because 
of 
this 
annihilation, 
poetry 
was 
driven 
like 
a 
homeless 
being 
from 
her 
natural 
ideal 
soil. 
If 
we 
have 
been 
right 
in 
assigning 
to 
music 
the 
power 
of 
again 
giving 
birth 
to 
myth, 
we 
may 
similarly 
expect 
to 
find 
the 
spirit 
of 
science 
on 
the 
path 
where 
it 
inimically 
opposes 
this 
mythopoeic 
power 
of 
music. 
This 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
New 
Attic 
Dithyramb, 
the 
music 
of 
which 
no 
longer 
expressed 
the 
inner 
essence, 
the 
will 
itself, 
but 
only 
rendered 
the 
phenomenon 
inadequately, 
in 
an 
imitation 
by 
means 
of 
concepts. 
From 
this 
intrinsically 
degenerate 
music 
the 
genuinely 
musical 
natures 
turned 
away 
with 
the 
same 
repugnance 
that 
they 
felt 
for 
the 
art-
destroying 
tendency 
of 
Socrates. 
The 
unerring 
instinct 
of 
Aristophanes 
was 
surely 
right 
when 
it 
included 
Socrates 
himself, 
the 
tragedy 
of 
Euripides, 
and 
the 
music 
of 
the 
New 
Dithyrambic 
poets 
in 
the 
same 
feeling 
of 
hatred, 
recognizing 
in 
all 
three 
phenomena 
the 
signs 
of 
a 
degenerate 
culture. 


In 
this 
New 
Dithyramb, 
music 
is 
outrageously 
manipulated 
so 
as 
to 
be 
the 
imitative 
counterfeit 
of 
a 
phenomenon, 
for 
instance, 
of 
a 
battle 
or 
a 
storm 
at 
sea; 
and 
thus, 
of 
course, 
it 
has 
been 
utterly 
robbed 
of 
its 
mythopoeic 
power. 
For 
if 
it 
seeks 
to 
arouse 
pleasure 
only 
by 
impelling 
us 
to 
seek 
external 
analogies 
between 
a 
vital 
or 
natural 
process 
and 
certain 
rhythmical 
figures 
and 
characteristic 
sounds 
of 
music; 
if 
our 
understanding 
is 
to 
content 
itself 
with 
the 
perception 
of 
these 
analogies; 
we 
are 
reduced 
to 
a 
frame 
of 
mind 
which 
makes 
impossible 
any 
reception 
of 
the 
mythical; 
for 
the 
myth 
wants 
to 
be 
experienced 
vividly 
as 
a 
unique 
example 
of 
a 
universality 
and 
truth 
that 
gaze 
into 
the 
infinite. 
The 
truly 
Dionysian 
music 
presents 
itself 
as 
such 
a 
general 
mirror 
of 
the 
universal 
will: 
the 
vivid 
event 
refracted 
in 
this 
mirror 
expands 
at 
once 
for 
our 
consciousness 
to 
the 
copy 
of 
an 
external 
truth. 
Conversely, 
such 
a 
vivid 
event 
is 
at 
once 
divested 
of 
every 
mythical 
character 
by 
the 
tone-painting 
of 
the 
New 
Dithyramb; 
music 
now 
becomes 
a 
wretched 
copy 
of 
the 
phenomenon, 
and 
therefore 
infinitely 
poorer 
than 
the 
phenomenon 
itself. 
And 
through 
this 
poverty 
it 
still 
further 
reduces 
the 
phenomenon 
for 
our 
consciousness, 
so 
that 
now, 
for 
example, 
a 
musically 
imitated 
battle 
of 
this 
sort 
exhausts 
itself 
in 
marches, 
signal 
sounds, 
etc., 
and 
our 
imagination 
is 
arrested 
precisely 
by 
these 
superficialities. 
Tone-painting 
is 
thus 
in 
every 
respect 
the 
opposite 
of 
true 
music 
with 
its 
mythopoeic 
power: 
through 
it 
the 
phenomenon, 
poor 
in 
itself, 
is 
made 
still 
poorer, 
while 
through 
Dionysian 
music 
the 
individual 
phenomenon 
is 
enriched 
and 
expanded 
into 
an 
image 
of 
the 
world. 
It 
was 
a 
great 
triumph 
for 
the 
un-Dionysian 
spirit 



when, 
by 
the 
development 
of 
the 
New 
Dithyramb, 
it 
had 
estranged 
music 
from 
itself 
and 
reduced 
it 
to 
be 
the 
slave 
of 
phenomena. 
Euripides, 
who, 
though 
in 
a 
higher 
sense, 
must 
be 
considered 
a 
thoroughly 
unmusical 
nature, 
is 
for 
this 
very 
reason 
a 
passionate 
adherent 
of 
the 
New 
Dithyrambic 
Music, 
and 
with 
the 
liberality 
of 
a 
robber 
makes 
use 
of 
all 
its 
effective 
tricks 
and 
mannerisms. 


In 
another 
direction 
also 
we 
see 
at 
work 
the 
power 
of 
this 
un-Dionysian 
myth-opposing 
spirit, 
when 
we 
turn 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
prevalence 
of 
character 
representation 
and 
psychological 
refinement 
in 
tragedy 
from 
Sophocles 
onward. 
The 
character 
must 
no 
longer 
be 
expanded 
into 
an 
eternal 
type, 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
must 
develop 
individually 
through 
artistic 
subordinate 
traits 
and 
shadings, 
through 
the 
nicest 
precision 
of 
all 
lines, 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
the 
spectator 
is 
in 
general 
no 
longer 
conscious 
of 
the 
myth, 
but 
of 
the 
vigorous 
truth 
to 
nature 
and 
the 
artist’s 
imitative 
power. 
Here 
also 
we 
observe 
the 
victory 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
over 
the 
universal, 
and 
the 
delight 
in 
a 
unique, 
almost 
anatomical 
preparation; 
we 
are 
already 
in 
the 
atmosphere 
of 
a 
theoretical 
world, 
where 
scientific 
knowledge 
is 
valued 
more 
highly 
than 
the 
artistic 
reflection 
of 
a 
universal 
law. 


The 
movement 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
character 
delineation 
proceeds 
rapidly: 
while 
Sophocles 
still 
portrays 
complete 
characters 
and 
employs 
myth 
for 
their 
refined 
development, 
Euripides 
already 
draws 
only 
prominent 
individual 
traits 
of 
character, 
which 
can 
express 
themselves 
in 
violent 
bursts 
of 
passion. 
In 
the 
New 
Attic 
Comedy, 
however, 
there 
are 
only 
masks 
with 
one 
expression: 
frivolous 
old 
men, 
duped 
panders, 
and 
cunning 
slaves, 
recurring 
incessantly. 
Where 
now 
is 
the 
mythopoeic 
spirit 
of 
music? 
What 
still 
remains 
of 
music 
is 
either 
excitatory 
or 
reminiscent 
music, 
that 
is, 
either 
a 
stimulant 
for 
dull 
and 
faded 
nerves, 
or 
tone-painting. 
As 
regards 
the 
former, 
it 
hardly 
matters 
about 
the 
text 
set 
to 
it: 
as 
soon 
as 
his 
heroes 
and 
choruses 
begin 
to 
sing, 
everything 
becomes 
pretty 
slovenly 
in 
Euripides; 
to 
what 
pass 
must 
things 
have 
come 
with 
his 
impertinent 
successors? 


The 
new 
un-Dionysian 
spirit, 
however, 
reveals 
itself 
most 
plainly 
in 
the 
dénouements 
of 
the 
new 
dramas. 
In 
the 
Old 
Tragedy 
one 
could 
sense 
at 
the 
end 
that 
metaphysical 
comfort 
without 
which 
the 
delight 
in 
tragedy 
cannot 
be 
explained 
at 
all. 
The 
reconciling 
tones 
from 
another 
world 
sound 
purest, 
perhaps, 
in 
the 
Oedipus 
at 
Colonus. 
Now 
that 
the 
genius 
of 
music 
has 
fled 
from 
tragedy, 
tragedy, 
strictly 
speaking, 
is 
dead: 
for 
from 
what 
source 
shall 
we 
now 
draw 
this 
metaphysical 
comfort? 
The 
new 
spirit, 
therefore, 
sought 
for 



an 
earthly 
resolution 
of 
the 
tragic 
dissonance. 
The 
hero, 
after 
being 
sufficiently 
tortured 
by 
fate, 
earned 
a 
well-deserved 
reward 
through 
a 
splendid 
marriage 
or 
tokens 
of 
divine 
favor. 
The 
hero 
had 
turned 
gladiator 
on 
whom, 
after 
he 
had 
been 
nicely 
beaten 
and 
covered 
with 
wounds, 
freedom 
was 
occasionally 
bestowed. 
The 
deus 
ex 
machina 
took 
the 
place 
of 
metaphysical 
comfort. 


I 
will 
not 
say 
that 
the 
tragic 
world 
view 
was 
everywhere 
completely 
destroyed 
by 
this 
intruding 
un-Dionysian 
spirit: 
we 
only 
know 
that 
it 
had 
to 
flee 
from 
art 
into 
the 
underworld 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
the 
degenerate 
form 
of 
a 
secret 
cult. 
Over 
the 
widest 
extent 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
character, 
however, 
there 
raged 
the 
consuming 
blast 
of 
this 
spirit, 
which 
manifests 
itself 
in 
the 
form 
of 
“Greek 
cheerfulness,” 
which 
we 
have 
already 
spoken 
of 
as 
a 
senile, 
unproductive 
love 
of 
existence. 
This 
cheerfulness 
stands 
opposed 
to 
the 
splendid 
“naïveté” 
of 
the 
earlier 
Greeks, 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
characterization 
given 
above, 
must 
be 
conceived 
as 
the 
blossom 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
culture 
springing 
from 
a 
dark 
abyss, 
as 
the 
victory 
which 
the 
Hellenic 
will, 
through 
its 
mirroring 
of 
beauty, 
obtains 
over 
suffering 
and 
the 
wisdom 
of 
suffering. 


The 
noblest 
manifestation 
of 
that 
other 
form 
of 
“Greek 
cheerfulness,” 
the 
Alexandrian, 
is 
the 
cheerfulness 
of 
the 
theoretical 
man. 
It 
exhibits 
the 
same 
characteristic 
symptoms 
that 
I 
have 
just 
deduced 
from 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
un-
Dionysian: 
it 
combats 
Dionysian 
wisdom 
and 
art, 
it 
seeks 
to 
dissolve 
myth, 
it 
substitutes 
for 
a 
metaphysical 
comfort 
an 
earthly 
consonance, 
in 
fact, 
a 
deus 
ex 
machina 
of 
its 
own, 
the 
god 
of 
machines 
and 
crucibles, 
that 
is, 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
spirits 
of 
nature 
recognized 
and 
employed 
in 
the 
service 
of 
a 
higher 
egoism; 
it 
believes 
that 
it 
can 
correct 
the 
world 
by 
knowledge, 
guide 
life 
by 
science, 
and 
actually 
confine 
the 
individual 
within 
a 
limited 
sphere 
of 
solvable 
problems, 
from 
which 
he 
can 
cheerfully 
say 
to 
life: 
“I 
desire 
you; 
you 
are 
worth 
knowing.” 



18 


It 
is 
an 
eternal 
phenomenon: 
the 
insatiable 
will 
always 
finds 
a 
way 
to 
detain 
its 
creatures 
in 
life 
and 
compel 
them 
to 
live 
on, 
by 
means 
of 
an 
illusion 
spread 
over 
things. 
One 
is 
chained 
by 
the 
Socratic 
love 
of 
knowledge 
and 
the 
delusion 
of 
being 
able 
thereby 
to 
heal 
the 
eternal 
wound 
of 
existence; 
another 
is 
ensnared 
by 
art’s 
seductive 
veil 
of 
beauty 
fluttering 
before 
his 
eyes; 
still 
another 
by 
the 
metaphysical 
comfort 
that 
beneath 
the 
whirl 
of 
phenomena 
eternal 
life 
flows 
on 
indestructibly—to 
say 
nothing 
of 
the 
more 
vulgar 
and 
almost 
more 
powerful 
illusions 
which 
the 
will 
always 
has 
at 
hand. 
These 
three 
stages 
of 
illusion 
are 
actually 
designed 
only 
for 
the 
more 
nobly 
formed 
natures, 
who 
actually 
feel 
profoundly 
the 
weight 
and 
burden 
of 
existence, 
and 
must 
be 
deluded 
by 
exquisite 
stimulants 
into 
forgetfulness 
of 
their 
displeasure. 
All 
that 
we 
call 
culture 
is 
made 
up 
of 
these 
stimulants; 
and, 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
the 
ingredients, 
we 
have 
either 
a 
dominantly 
Socratic 
or 
artistic 
or 
tragic 
culture; 
or, 
if 
historical 
exemplifications 
are 
permitted, 
there 
is 
either 
an 
Alexandrian 
or 
a 
Hellenic 
or 
a 
Buddhistic 
culture.1 


Our 
whole 
modern 
world 
is 
entangled 
in 
the 
net 
of 
Alexandrian2 
culture. 
It 
proposes 
as 
its 
ideal 
the 
theoretical 
man 
equipped 
with 
the 
greatest 
forces 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
laboring 
in 
the 
service 
of 
science, 
whose 
archetype 
and 
progenitor 
is 
Socrates. 
All 
our 
educational 
methods 
originally 
have 
this 
ideal 
in 
view: 
every 
other 
form 
of 
existence 
must 
struggle 
on 
laboriously 
beside 
it, 
as 
something 
tolerated, 
but 
not 
intended. 
In 
an 
almost 
alarming 
manner 
the 
cultured 
man 
was 
for 
a 
long 
time 
found 
only 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
scholar: 
even 
our 
poetical 
arts 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
evolve 
from 
scholarly 
imitations, 
and 
in 
the 
main 
effect, 
that 
of 
rhyme, 
we 
still 
recognize 
the 
origin 
of 
our 
poetic 
form 
from 
artificial 
experiments 
with 
a 
nonindigenous, 
really 
scholarly 
language. 
How 
unintelligible 
must 
Faust, 
the 
modern 
cultured 
man, 
who 
is 
in 
himself 
intelligible, 
have 
appeared 
to 
a 
true 
Greek—Faust, 
storming 
unsatisfied 
through 
all 
the 
faculties, 
devoted 
to 
magic 
and 
the 
devil 
from 
a 
desire 
for 
knowledge; 
Faust, 
whom 
we 
have 
but 
to 
place 
beside 
Socrates 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
comparison, 
in 
order 
to 
see 
that 
modern 
man 
is 
beginning 
to 



divine 
the 
limits 
of 
this 
Socratic 
love 
of 
knowledge 
and 
yearns 
for 
a 
coast 
in 
the 
wide 
waste 
of 
the 
ocean 
of 
knowledge. 
When 
Goethe 
on 
one 
occasion 
said 
to 
Eckermann 
with 
reference 
to 
Napoleon: 
“Yes, 
my 
good 
friend, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
productiveness 
of 
deeds,” 
he 
reminded 
us 
in 
a 
charmingly 
naïve 
manner 
that 
the 
nontheorist 
is 
something 
incredible 
and 
astounding 
to 
modern 
man; 
so 
that 
we 
again 
have 
need 
of 
the 
wisdom 
of 
Goethe 
to 
discover 
that 
such 
a 
surprising 
form 
of 
existence 
is 
not 
only 
comprehensible, 
but 
even 
pardonable. 


Now 
we 
must 
not 
hide 
from 
ourselves 
what 
is 
concealed 
in 
the 
womb 
of 
this 
Socratic 
culture: 
optimism, 
with 
its 
delusion 
of 
limitless 
power. 
We 
must 
not 
be 
alarmed 
if 
the 
fruits 
of 
this 
optimism 
ripen—if 
society, 
leavened 
to 
the 
very 
lowest 
strata 
by 
this 
kind 
of 
culture, 
gradually 
begins 
to 
tremble 
with 
wanton 
agitations 
and 
desires, 
if 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
earthly 
happiness 
of 
all, 
if 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
possibility 
of 
such 
a 
general 
intellectual 
culture 
changes 
into 
the 
threatening 
demand 
for 
such 
an 
Alexandrian 
earthly 
happiness, 
into 
the 
conjuring 
up 
of 
a 
Euripidean 
deus 
ex 
machina. 


Let 
us 
mark 
this 
well: 
the 
Alexandrian 
culture, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
exist 
permanently, 
requires 
a 
slave 
class, 
but 
with 
its 
optimistic 
view 
of 
life 
it 
denies 
the 
necessity 
of 
such 
a 
class, 
and 
consequently, 
when 
its 
beautifully 
seductive 
and 
tranquillizing 
utterances 
about 
the 
“dignity 
of 
man” 
and 
the 
“dignity 
of 
labor” 
are 
no 
longer 
effective, 
it 
gradually 
drifts 
toward 
a 
dreadful 
destruction. 
There 
is 
nothing 
more 
terrible 
than 
a 
class 
of 
barbaric 
slaves 
who 
have 
learned 
to 
regard 
their 
existence 
as 
an 
injustice, 
and 
now 
prepare 
to 
avenge, 
not 
only 
themselves, 
but 
all 
generations. 
In 
the 
face 
of 
such 
threatening 
storms, 
who 
dares 
to 
appeal 
with 
any 
confidence 
to 
our 
pale 
and 
exhausted 
religions, 
the 
very 
foundations 
of 
which 
have 
degenerated 
into 
scholarly 
religions? 
Myth, 
the 
necessary 
prerequisite 
of 
every 
religion, 
is 
already 
paralyzed 
everywhere, 
and 
even 
in 
this 
domain 
the 
optimistic 
spirit, 
which 
we 
have 
just 
designated 
as 
the 
germ 
of 
destruction 
in 
our 
society, 
has 
attained 
the 
mastery. 


While 
the 
disaster 
slumbering 
in 
the 
womb 
of 
theoretical 
culture 
gradually 
begins 
to 
frighten 
modern 
man, 
and 
he 
anxiously 
ransacks 
the 
stores 
of 
his 
experience 
for 
means 
to 
avert 
the 
danger, 
though 
he 
has 
no 
great 
faith 
in 
these 
means; 
while 
he, 
therefore, 
begins 
to 
divine 
the 
consequences 
of 
his 
situation—great 
men, 
universally 
gifted, 
have 
contrived, 
with 
an 
incredible 
amount 
of 
thought, 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
paraphernalia 
of 
science 
itself, 
to 
point 
out 
the 
limits 
and 
the 
relativity 
of 
knowledge 
generally, 
and 
thus 
to 
deny 



decisively 
the 
claim 
of 
science 
to 
universal 
validity 
and 
universal 
aims. 
And 
their 
demonstration 
diagnosed 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
illusory 
notion 
which 
pretends 
to 
be 
able 
to 
fathom 
the 
innermost 
essence 
of 
things 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
causality. 
The 
extraordinary 
courage 
and 
wisdom 
of 
Kant 
and 
Schopenhauer 
have 
succeeded 
in 
gaining 
the 
most 
difficult 
victory, 
the 
victory 
over 
the 
optimism 
concealed 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
logic—an 
optimism 
that 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
our 
culture. 
While 
this 
optimism, 
resting 
on 
apparently 
unobjectionable 
aeternae 
veritates,3 
had 
believed 
that 
all 
the 
riddles 
of 
the 
universe 
could 
be 
known 
and 
fathomed, 
and 
had 
treated 
space, 
time, 
and 
causality 
as 
entirely 
unconditional 
laws 
of 
the 
most 
universal 
validity, 
Kant 
showed 
that 
these 
really 
served 
only 
to 
elevate 
the 
mere 
phenomenon, 
the 
work 
of 
māyā, 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
sole 
and 
highest 
reality, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
the 
innermost 
and 
true 
essence 
of 
things, 
thus 
making 
impossible 
any 
knowledge 
of 
this 
essence 
or, 
in 
Schopenhauer’s 
words, 
lulling 
the 
dreamer 
still 
more 
soundly 
asleep. 


With 
this 
insight 
a 
culture 
is 
inaugurated 
that 
I 
venture 
to 
call 
a 
tragic 
culture. 
Its 
most 
important 
characteristic 
is 
that 
wisdom 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
science 
as 
the 
highest 
end—wisdom 
that, 
uninfluenced 
by 
the 
seductive 
distractions 
of 
the 
sciences, 
turns 
with 
unmoved 
eyes 
to 
a 
comprehensive 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
seeks 
to 
grasp, 
with 
sympathetic 
feelings 
of 
love, 
the 
eternal 
suffering 
as 
its 
own. 


Let 
us 
imagine 
a 
coming 
generation 
with 
such 
intrepidity 
of 
vision, 
with 
such 
a 
heroic 
penchant 
for 
the 
tremendous; 
let 
us 
imagine 
the 
bold 
stride 
of 
these 
dragon-slayers, 
the 
proud 
audacity 
with 
which 
they 
turn 
their 
back 
on 
all 
the 
weaklings’ 
doctrines 
of 
optimism 
in 
order 
to 
“live 
resolutely” 
in 
wholeness 
and 
fullness:4 
would 
it 
not 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
tragic 
man 
of 
such 
a 
culture, 
in 
view 
of 
his 
self-education 
for 
seriousness 
and 
terror, 
to 
desire 
a 
new 
art, 
the 
art 
of 
metaphysical 
comfort, 
to 
desire 
tragedy 
as 
his 
own 
proper 
Helen, 
and 
to 
exclaim 
with 
Faust: 


Should 
not 
my 
longing 
overleap 
the 
distance 
And 
draw 
the 
fairest 
form 
into 
existence?5 


But 
now 
that 
the 
Socratic 
culture 
can 
only 
hold 
the 
scepter 
of 
its 
infallibility 
with 
trembling 
hands; 
now 
that 
it 
has 
been 
shaken 
from 
two 
directions—once 
by 
the 
fear 
of 
its 
own 
consequences 
which 
it 
at 
length 
begins 
to 
surmise, 
and 
again 
because 
it 
no 
longer 
has 
its 
former 
naïve 
confidence 
in 
the 
eternal 
validity 
of 
its 
foundation—it 
is 
a 
sad 
spectacle 
to 



see 
how 
the 
dance 
of 
its 
thought 
rushes 
longingly 
toward 
ever-new 
forms, 
to 
embrace 
them, 
and 
then, 
shuddering, 
lets 
them 
go 
suddenly 
as 
Mephistopheles 
does 
the 
seductive 
Lamiae.6 
It 
is 
certainly 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
“breach” 
of 
which 
everyone 
speaks 
as 
the 
fundamental 
malady 
of 
modern 
culture, 
that 
the 
theoretical 
man, 
alarmed 
and 
dissatisfied 
at 
his 
own 
consequences, 
no 
longer 
dares 
entrust 
himself 
to 
the 
terrible 
icy 
current 
of 
existence: 
he 
runs 
timidly 
up 
and 
down 
the 
bank. 
So 
thoroughly 
has 
he 
been 
pampered 
by 
his 
optimistic 
views 
that 
he 
no 
longer 
wants 
to 
have 
anything 
whole, 
with 
all 
of 
nature’s 
cruelty 
attaching 
to 
it. 
Besides, 
he 
feels 
that 
a 
culture 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
science 
must 
be 
destroyed 
when 
it 
begins 
to 
grow 
illogical, 
that 
is, 
to 
retreat 
before 
its 
own 
consequences. 
Our 
art 
reveals 
this 
universal 
distress: 
in 
vain 
does 
one 
depend 
imitatively 
on 
all 
the 
great 
productive 
periods 
and 
natures; 
in 
vain 
does 
one 
accumulate 
the 
entire 
“world-literature” 
around 
modern 
man 
for 
his 
comfort; 
in 
vain 
does 
one 
place 
oneself 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
art 
styles 
and 
artists 
of 
all 
ages, 
so 
that 
one 
may 
give 
names 
to 
them 
as 
Adam 
did 
to 
the 
beasts: 
one 
still 
remains 
eternally 
hungry, 
the 
“critic” 
without 
joy 
and 
energy, 
the 
Alexandrian 
man, 
who 
is 
at 
bottom 
a 
librarian 
and 
corrector 
of 
proofs, 
and 
wretchedly 
goes 
blind 
from 
the 
dust 
of 
books 
and 
from 
printers’ 
errors. 



19 


We 
cannot 
indicate 
the 
innermost 
modern 
content 
of 
this 
Socratic 
culture 
more 
distinctly 
than 
by 
calling 
it 
the 
culture 
of 
the 
opera: 
for 
it 
is 
in 
this 
department 
that 
this 
culture 
has 
expressed 
its 
aims 
and 
perceptions 
with 
special 
naïveté, 
which 
is 
surprising 
when 
we 
compare 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
opera 
and 
the 
facts 
of 
operatic 
development 
with 
the 
eternal 
truths 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
Dionysian. 
I 
recall 
first 
of 
all 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
stilo 
rappresentativo1 
and 
the 
recitative. 
Is 
it 
credible 
that 
this 
thoroughly 
externalized 
operatic 
music, 
incapable 
of 
devotion, 
could 
be 
received 
and 
cherished 
with 
enthusiastic 
favor, 
as 
a 
rebirth, 
as 
it 
were, 
of 
all 
true 
music, 
by 
the 
very 
age 
in 
which 
had 
appeared 
the 
ineffably 
sublime 
and 
sacred 
music 
of 
Palestrina? 
And 
who, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
would 
think 
of 
making 
only 
the 
diversion-craving 
luxuriousness 
of 
those 
Florentine 
circles 
and 
the 
vanity 
of 
their 
dramatic 
singers 
responsible 
for 
the 
love 
of 
the 
opera 
which 
spread 
with 
such 
rapidity? 
That 
in 
the 
same 
age, 
even 
among 
the 
same 
people, 
this 
passion 
for 
a 
half-musical 
mode 
of 
speech 
should 
awaken 
alongside 
of 
the 
vaulted 
structure 
of 
Palestrina 
harmonies 
which 
all 
medieval 
Christendom 
had 
been 
building 
up, 
I 
can 
explain 
to 
myself 
only 
by 
a 
cooperating, 
extra-
artistic 
tendency 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
recitative. 


The 
listener 
who 
insists 
on 
distinctly 
hearing 
the 
words 
under 
the 
music 
has 
his 
desire 
fulfilled 
by 
the 
singer 
in 
that 
the 
latter 
speaks 
rather 
than 
sings, 
intensifying 
the 
pathetic 
expression 
of 
the 
words 
by 
means 
of 
this 
half-song. 
By 
this 
intensification 
of 
the 
pathos 
he 
facilitates 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
words 
and 
overcomes 
the 
remaining 
half 
of 
the 
music. 
The 
specific 
danger 
now 
threatening 
him 
is 
that 
in 
some 
unguarded 
moment 
he 
may 
stress 
the 
music 
unduly, 
which 
would 
immediately 
entail 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
pathos 
of 
the 
speech 
and 
the 
distinctness 
of 
the 
words; 
while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
feels 
himself 
continually 
impelled 
to 
musical 
discharge 
and 
a 
virtuoso 
exhibition 
of 
his 
vocal 
talent. 
Here 
the 
“poet” 
comes 
to 
his 
aid, 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
provide 
him 
with 
abundant 
opportunities 
for 
lyrical 
interjections, 
repetitions 
of 
words 
and 
sentences, 
etc.—at 
which 
places 
the 
singer, 
now 
in 
the 
purely 
musical 
element, 
can 
rest 
himself 
without 
paying 
any 
attention 
to 



the 
words. 
This 
alternation 
of 
emotionally 
impressive 
speech 
which, 
however, 
is 
only 
half 
sung, 
with 
interjections 
which 
are 
wholly 
sung, 
an 
alternation 
characteristic 
of 
the 
stilo 
rappresentativo, 
this 
rapidly 
changing 
endeavor 
to 
affect 
now 
the 
concepts 
and 
imagination 
of 
the 
hearer, 
now 
his 
musical 
sense, 
is 
something 
so 
utterly 
unnatural 
and 
likewise 
so 
intrinsically 
contradictory 
both 
to 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
Dionysian 
artistic 
impulses, 
that 
one 
has 
to 
infer 
an 
origin 
of 
the 
recitative 
lying 
outside 
all 
artistic 
instincts. 
According 
to 
this 
description, 
the 
recitative 
must 
be 
defined 
as 
a 
mixture 
of 
epic 
and 
lyric 
delivery, 
not 
by 
any 
means 
as 
an 
intrinsically 
stable 
mixture, 
a 
state 
not 
to 
be 
attained 
in 
the 
case 
of 
such 
totally 
disparate 
elements, 
but 
as 
an 
entirely 
superficial 
mosaic 
conglutination, 
such 
as 
is 
totally 
unprecedented 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
nature 
and 
experience. 
But 
this 
was 
not 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
inventors 
of 
the 
recitative: 
they 
themselves, 
together 
with 
their 
age, 
believed 
rather 
that 
the 
mystery 
of 
antique 
music 
has 
been 
solved 
by 
this 
stilo 
rappresentativo, 
in 
which, 
so 
they 
thought, 
was 
to 
be 
found 
the 
only 
explanation 
of 
the 
enormous 
influence 
of 
an 
Orpheus, 
an 
Amphion, 
and 
even 
of 
Greek 
tragedy. 
The 
new 
style 
was 
looked 
upon 
as 
the 
reawakening 
of 
the 
most 
effective 
music, 
ancient 
Greek 
music: 
indeed, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
universal 
and 
popular 
conception 
of 
the 
Homeric 
as 
the 
primitive 
world, 
they 
could 
abandon 
themselves 
to 
the 
dream 
of 
having 
descended 
once 
more 
into 
the 
paradisiacal 
beginnings 
of 
mankind, 
where 
music 
also 
must 
have 
had 
that 
unsurpassed 
purity, 
power, 
and 
innocence 
of 
which 
the 
poets, 
in 
their 
pastoral 
plays, 
could 
give 
such 
touching 
accounts. 
Here 
we 
can 
see 
into 
the 
innermost 
development 
of 
this 
thoroughly 
modern 
variety 
of 
art, 
the 
opera: 
art 
here 
responds 
to 
a 
powerful 
need, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
nonaesthetic 
need: 
the 
yearning 
for 
the 
idyllic, 
the 
faith 
in 
the 
primordial 
existence 
of 
the 
artistic 
and 
good 
man. 
The 
recitative 
was 
regarded 
as 
the 
rediscovered 
language 
of 
this 
primitive 
man; 
opera 
as 
the 
rediscovered 
country 
of 
this 
idyllically 
or 
heroically 
good 
creature, 
who 
simultaneously 
with 
every 
action 
follows 
a 
natural 
artistic 
impulse, 
who 
accomplishes 
his 
speech 
with 
a 
little 
singing, 
in 
order 
that 
he 
may 
immediately 
break 
forth 
into 
full 
song 
at 
the 
slightest 
emotional 
excitement. 


It 
is 
now 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
us 
that 
the 
humanists 
of 
the 
time 
combated 
the 
old 
ecclesiastical 
conception 
of 
man 
as 
inherently 
corrupt 
and 
lost, 
with 
this 
newly 
created 
picture 
of 
the 
paradisiacal 
artist: 
so 
that 
opera 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
the 
opposition 
dogma 
of 
the 
good 
man, 
but 
may 
also, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
provide 
a 
consolation 
for 
that 
pessimism 
which, 
owing 
to 
the 



frightful 
uncertainty 
of 
all 
conditions 
of 
life, 
attracted 
precisely 
the 
serious-
minded 
men 
of 
the 
time. 
For 
us, 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
have 
perceived 
that 
the 
essential 
charm, 
and 
therefore 
the 
genesis, 
of 
this 
new 
art 
form 
lies 
in 
the 
gratification 
of 
an 
altogether 
nonaesthetic 
need, 
in 
the 
optimistic 
glorification 
of 
man 
as 
such, 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
primitive 
man 
as 
the 
man 
naturally 
good 
and 
artistic—a 
principle 
of 
the 
opera 
that 
has 
gradually 
changed 
into 
a 
threatening 
and 
terrible 
demand 
which, 
in 
face 
of 
contemporary 
socialistic 
movements, 
we 
can 
no 
longer 
ignore. 
The 
“good 
primitive 
man” 
wants 
his 
rights: 
what 
paradisiacal 
prospects! 


Besides 
this 
I 
place 
another 
equally 
obvious 
confirmation 
of 
my 
view 
that 
opera 
is 
based 
on 
the 
same 
principles 
as 
our 
Alexandrian 
culture. 
Opera 
is 
the 
birth 
of 
the 
theoretical 
man, 
the 
critical 
layman, 
not 
of 
the 
artist: 
one 
of 
the 
most 
surprising 
facts 
in 
the 
history 
of 
all 
the 
arts. 
It 
was 
the 
demand 
of 
thoroughly 
unmusical 
hearers 
that 
before 
everything 
else 
the 
words 
must 
be 
understood, 
so 
that 
according 
to 
them 
a 
rebirth 
of 
music 
is 
to 
be 
expected 
only 
when 
some 
mode 
of 
singing 
has 
been 
discovered 
in 
which 
text-word 
lords 
it 
over 
counterpoint 
like 
master 
over 
servant. 
For 
the 
words, 
it 
is 
argued, 
are 
as 
much 
nobler 
than 
the 
accompanying 
harmonic 
system 
as 
the 
soul 
is 
nobler 
than 
the 
body. 


It 
was 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
laically 
unmusical 
crudeness 
of 
these 
views 
that 
the 
combination 
of 
music, 
image, 
and 
words 
was 
effected 
in 
the 
beginnings 
of 
the 
opera. 
In 
the 
spirit 
of 
this 
aesthetic 
the 
first 
experiments 
were 
made 
in 
the 
leading 
amateur 
circles 
of 
Florence 
by 
the 
poets 
and 
singers 
patronized 
there. 
The 
man 
incapable 
of 
art 
creates 
for 
himself 
a 
kind 
of 
art 
precisely 
because 
he 
is 
the 
inartistic 
man 
as 
such. 
Because 
he 
does 
not 
sense 
the 
Dionysian 
depth 
of 
music, 
he 
changes 
his 
musical 
taste 
into 
an 
appreciation 
of 
the 
understandable 
word-and-tone-rhetoric 
of 
the 
passions 
in 
the 
stilo 
rappresentativo, 
and 
into 
the 
voluptuousness 
of 
the 
arts 
of 
song. 
Because 
he 
is 
unable 
to 
behold 
a 
vision, 
he 
forces 
the 
machinist 
and 
the 
decorative 
artist 
into 
his 
service. 
Because 
he 
cannot 
comprehend 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
the 
artist, 
he 
conjures 
up 
the 
“artistic 
primitive 
man” 
to 
suit 
his 
taste, 
that 
is, 
the 
man 
who 
sings 
and 
recites 
verses 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
passion. 
He 
dreams 
himself 
back 
into 
a 
time 
when 
passion 
sufficed 
to 
generate 
songs 
and 
poems; 
as 
if 
emotion 
had 
ever 
been 
able 
to 
create 
anything 
artistic. 


The 
premise 
of 
the 
opera 
is 
a 
false 
belief 
concerning 
the 
artistic 
process: 
the 
idyllic 
belief 
that 
every 
sentient 
man 
is 
an 
artist. 
This 
belief 
would 
make 



opera 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
taste 
of 
the 
laity 
in 
art, 
dictating 
their 
laws 
with 
the 
cheerful 
optimism 
of 
the 
theoretical 
man. 


Should 
we 
desire 
to 
combine 
the 
two 
conceptions 
that 
have 
just 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
influenced 
the 
origin 
of 
opera, 
it 
would 
merely 
remain 
for 
us 
to 
speak 
of 
an 
idyllic 
tendency 
of 
the 
opera. 
In 
this 
connection 
we 
need 
only 
avail 
ourselves 
of 
the 
expressions 
and 
explanation 
of 
Schiller. 
Nature 
and 
the 
ideal, 
he 
says, 
are 
either 
objects 
of 
grief, 
when 
the 
former 
is 
represented 
as 
lost, 
the 
latter 
unattained; 
or 
both 
are 
objects 
of 
joy, 
in 
that 
they 
are 
represented 
as 
real. 
The 
first 
case 
furnishes 
the 
elegy 
in 
its 
narrower 
signification, 
the 
second 
the 
idyll 
in 
its 
widest 
sense. 


Here 
we 
must 
at 
once 
call 
attention 
to 
the 
common 
characteristic 
of 
these 
two 
conceptions 
in 
the 
genesis 
of 
opera, 
namely, 
that 
in 
them 
the 
ideal 
is 
not 
felt 
as 
unattained 
or 
nature 
as 
lost. 
This 
sentiment 
supposes 
that 
there 
was 
a 
primitive 
age 
of 
man 
when 
he 
lay 
close 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
nature, 
and, 
owing 
to 
this 
naturalness, 
had 
at 
once 
attained 
the 
ideal 
of 
mankind 
in 
a 
paradisiacal 
goodness 
and 
artistry. 
From 
this 
perfect 
primitive 
man 
all 
of 
us 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
descended. 
We 
were 
even 
supposed 
to 
be 
faithful 
copies 
of 
him; 
only 
we 
had 
to 
cast 
off 
a 
few 
things 
in 
order 
to 
recognize 
ourselves 
once 
more 
as 
this 
primitive 
man, 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
voluntary 
renunciation 
of 
superfluous 
learnedness, 
of 
superabundant 
culture. 
It 
was 
to 
such 
a 
concord 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
ideal, 
to 
an 
idyllic 
reality, 
that 
the 
cultured 
Renaissance 
man 
let 
himself 
be 
led 
back 
by 
his 
operatic 
imitation 
of 
Greek 
tragedy. 
He 
made 
use 
of 
this 
tragedy 
as 
Dante 
made 
use 
of 
Vergil, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
conducted 
to 
the 
gates 
of 
paradise; 
while 
from 
this 
point 
he 
continued 
unassisted 
and 
passed 
over 
from 
an 
imitation 
of 
the 
highest 
Greek 
art-form 
to 
a 
“restoration 
of 
all 
things,” 
to 
an 
imitation 
of 
man’s 
original 
art-world. 
What 
a 
cheerful 
confidence 
there 
is 
about 
these 
daring 
endeavors, 
in 
the 
very 
heart 
of 
theoretical 
culture!—solely 
to 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
comforting 
belief, 
that 
“man-in-himself” 
is 
the 
eternally 
virtuous 
hero 
of 
the 
opera, 
the 
eternally 
piping 
or 
singing 
shepherd, 
who 
must 
always 
in 
the 
end 
rediscover 
himself 
as 
such, 
should 
he 
ever 
at 
any 
time 
have 
really 
lost 
himself; 
to 
be 
considered 
solely 
as 
the 
fruit 
of 
that 
optimism, 
which 
here 
rises 
like 
a 
sweetishly 
seductive 
column 
of 
vapor 
from 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
Socratic 
world 
view. 


Therefore, 
the 
features 
of 
the 
opera 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
exhibit 
the 
elegiac 
sorrow 
of 
an 
eternal 
loss, 
but 
rather 
the 
cheerfulness 
of 
eternal 
rediscovery, 
the 
comfortable 
delight 
in 
an 
idyllic 
reality 
which 
one 
can 
at 
least 
always 
imagine 
as 
real. 
But 
in 
this 
process 
one 
may 
some 
day 
grasp 
the 
fact 
that 
this 



supposed 
reality 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
fantastically 
silly 
dawdling, 
at 
which 
everyone 
who 
could 
judge 
it 
by 
the 
terrible 
seriousness 
of 
true 
nature, 
and 
compare 
it 
with 
actual 
primitive 
scenes 
of 
the 
beginnings 
of 
mankind, 
would 
be 
impelled 
to 
call 
out, 
nauseated: 
Away 
with 
the 
phantom! 


Nevertheless, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
imagine 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
merely 
by 
a 
vigorous 
shout 
to 
frighten 
away 
such 
a 
playful 
thing 
as 
the 
opera, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
specter. 
He 
who 
would 
destroy 
the 
opera 
must 
take 
up 
the 
struggle 
against 
Alexandrian 
cheerfulness, 
which 
expresses 
itself 
so 
naively 
in 
opera 
concerning 
its 
favorite 
idea. 
Indeed, 
opera 
is 
its 
specific 
form 
of 
art. 
But 
what 
may 
art 
itself 
expect 
from 
the 
operation 
of 
an 
art 
form 
whose 
beginnings 
lie 
entirely 
outside 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
province 
and 
which 
has 
stolen 
over 
from 
a 
half-moral 
sphere 
into 
the 
artistic 
domain, 
deceiving 
us 
only 
occasionally 
about 
its 
hybrid 
origin? 
By 
what 
sap 
is 
this 
parasitic 
opera 
nourished, 
if 
not 
by 
that 
of 
true 
art? 
Must 
we 
not 
suppose 
that 
the 
highest 
and, 
indeed, 
the 
truly 
serious 
task 
of 
art—to 
save 
the 
eye 
from 
gazing 
into 
the 
horrors 
of 
night 
and 
to 
deliver 
the 
subject 
by 
the 
healing 
balm 
of 
illusion 
from 
the 
spasms 
of 
the 
agitations 
of 
the 
will—must 
degenerate 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
its 
idyllic 
seductions 
and 
Alexandrian 
flatteries 
to 
become 
an 
empty 
and 
merely 
distracting 
diversion? 
What 
will 
become 
of 
the 
eternal 
truths 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
and 
Apollinian 
when 
the 
styles 
are 
mixed 
in 
this 
fashion, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
to 
be 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
stilo 
rappresentativo? 
A 
style 
in 
which 
music 
is 
regarded 
as 
the 
servant, 
the 
text 
as 
the 
master, 
where 
music 
is 
compared 
with 
the 
body, 
the 
text 
with 
the 
soul? 
where 
at 
best 
the 
highest 
aim 
will 
be 
directed 
toward 
a 
paraphrastic 
tone-painting, 
just 
as 
formerly 
in 
the 
New 
Attic 
Dithyramb? 
where 
music 
is 
completely 
alienated 
from 
its 
true 
dignity 
as 
the 
Dionysian 
mirror 
of 
the 
world, 
so 
that 
the 
only 
thing 
left 
to 
it, 
as 
the 
slave 
of 
phenomena, 
is 
to 
imitate 
the 
formal 
character 
of 
phenomena, 
and 
to 
arouse 
a 
superficial 
pleasure 
in 
the 
play 
of 
lines 
and 
proportions. 
Closely 
observed, 
this 
fatal 
influence 
of 
the 
opera 
on 
music 
is 
seen 
to 
coincide 
exactly 
with 
the 
universal 
development 
of 
modern 
music; 
the 
optimism 
lurking 
in 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
opera 
and 
in 
the 
character 
of 
the 
culture 
thereby 
represented, 
has, 
with 
alarming 
rapidity, 
succeeded 
in 
divesting 
music 
of 
its 
Dionysian-cosmic 
mission 
and 
impressing 
on 
it 
a 
playfully 
formal 
and 
pleasurable 
character: 
a 
change 
comparable 
to 
the 
metamorphosis 
of 
the 
Aeschylean 
man 
into 
the 
cheerful 
Alexandrian. 


If, 
however, 
in 
the 
exemplification 
here 
indicated, 
we 
have 
rightly 
associated 
the 
disappearance 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
spirit 
with 
a 
most 
striking, 
but 



hitherto 
unexplained, 
transformation 
and 
degeneration 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
man— 
what 
hopes 
must 
revive 
in 
us 
when 
the 
most 
certain 
auspices 
guarantee 
the 
reverse 
process, 
the 
gradual 
awakening 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
spirit 
in 
our 
modern 
world! 
It 
is 
impossible 
that 
the 
divine 
strength 
of 
Herakles 
should 
languish 
for 
ever 
in 
ample 
bondage 
to 
Omphale.2 
Out 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
root 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
a 
power 
has 
arisen 
which, 
having 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
the 
primitive 
conditions 
of 
Socratic 
culture, 
can 
neither 
be 
explained 
nor 
excused 
by 
it, 
but 
which 
is 
rather 
felt 
by 
this 
culture 
as 
something 
terribly 
inexplicable 
and 
overwhelmingly 
hostile—German 
music 
as 
we 
must 
understand 
it, 
particularly 
in 
its 
vast 
solar 
orbit 
from 
Bach 
to 
Beethoven, 
from 
Beethoven 
to 
Wagner. 


Even 
under 
the 
most 
favorable 
circumstances 
what 
can 
the 
knowledge-
craving 
Socratism 
of 
our 
days 
do 
with 
this 
demon 
rising 
from 
unfathomable 
depths? 
Neither 
by 
means 
of 
the 
flourishes 
and 
arabesques 
of 
operatic 
melody, 
nor 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
arithmetical 
counting 
board 
of 
fugue 
and 
contrapuntal 
dialectic 
is 
the 
formula 
to 
be 
found 
by 
whose 
thrice-powerful 
light 
one 
might 
subdue 
this 
demon 
and 
compel 
it 
to 
speak. 
What 
a 
spectacle, 
when 
our 
latter-day 
aestheticians, 
with 
a 
net 
of 
“beauty” 
peculiar 
to 
themselves, 
pursue 
and 
clutch 
at 
the 
genius 
of 
music 
whirling 
before 
display 
activities 
which 
are 
not 
to 
be 
judged 
by 
the 
standard 
of 
eternal 
beauty 
any 
more 
than 
by 
the 
standard 
of 
the 
sublime. 
Let 
us 
but 
observe 
these 
patrons 
of 
music 
at 
close 
range, 
as 
they 
really 
are, 
indefatigably 
crying: 
“Beauty! 
beauty!” 
Do 
they 
really 
bear 
the 
stamp 
of 
nature’s 
darling 
children 
who 
are 
fostered 
and 
nourished 
at 
the 
breast 
of 
the 
beautiful, 
or 
are 
they 
not 
rather 
seeking 
a 
mendacious 
cloak 
for 
their 
own 
coarseness, 
an 
aesthetical 
pretext 
for 
their 
own 
insensitive 
sobriety; 
here 
I 
am 
thinking 
of 
Otto 
Jahn, 
for 
example.3 
But 
let 
the 
liar 
and 
the 
hypocrite 
beware 
of 
German 
music: 
for 
amid 
all 
our 
culture 
it 
is 
really 
the 
only 
genuine, 
pure, 
and 
purifying 
fire-
spirit 
from 
which 
and 
toward 
which, 
as 
in 
the 
teaching 
of 
the 
great 
Heraclitus 
of 
Ephesus, 
all 
things 
move 
in 
a 
double 
orbit: 
all 
that 
we 
now 
call 
culture, 
education, 
civilization, 
must 
some 
day 
appear 
before 
the 
unerring 
judge, 
Dionysus. 


Let 
us 
recollect 
further 
that 
Kant 
and 
Schopenhauer 
made 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
spirit 
of 
German 
philosophy, 
streaming 
from 
similar 
sources, 
to 
destroy 
scientific 
Socratism’s 
complacent 
delight 
in 
existence 
by 
establishing 
its 
boundaries; 
how 
through 
this 
delimitation 
was 
introduced 
an 
infinitely 
profounder 
and 
more 
serious 
view 
of 
ethical 
problems 
and 
of 
art, 
which 
we 



may 
designate 
as 
Dionysian 
wisdom 
comprised 
in 
concepts. 
To 
what 
then 
does 
the 
mystery 
of 
this 
oneness 
of 
German 
music 
and 
philosophy 
point 
if 
not 
to 
a 
new 
form 
of 
existence, 
concerning 
whose 
character 
we 
can 
only 
inform 
ourselves 
by 
surmise 
from 
Hellenic 
analogies? 
For 
to 
us 
who 
stand 
on 
the 
boundary 
line 
between 
two 
different 
forms 
of 
existence, 
the 
Hellenic 
prototype 
retains 
this 
immeasurable 
value, 
that 
all 
these 
transitions 
and 
struggles 
are 
imprinted 
upon 
it 
in 
a 
classically 
instructive 
form; 
except 
that 
we, 
as 
it 
were, 
pass 
through 
the 
chief 
epochs 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
genius, 
analogically 
in 
reverse 
order, 
and 
seem 
now, 
for 
instance, 
to 
be 
passing 
backward 
from 
the 
Alexandrian 
age 
to 
the 
period 
of 
tragedy. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
have 
the 
feeling 
that 
the 
birth 
of 
a 
tragic 
age 
simply 
means 
a 
return 
to 
itself 
of 
the 
German 
spirit, 
a 
blessed 
self-rediscovery 
after 
powerful 
intrusive 
influences 
had 
for 
a 
long 
time 
compelled 
it, 
living 
as 
it 
did 
in 
a 
helpless 
and 
unchaste 
barbarism, 
to 
servitude 
under 
their 
form. 
Now 
at 
last, 
upon 
returning 
to 
the 
primitive 
source 
of 
its 
being, 
it 
may 
venture 
to 
stride 
along 
boldly 
and 
freely 
before 
the 
eyes 
of 
all 
nations 
without 
being 
attached 
to 
the 
lead 
strings 
of 
a 
Romanic 
civilization; 
if 
only 
it 
can 
learn 
constantly 
from 
one 
people—the 
Greeks, 
from 
whom 
to 
be 
able 
to 
learn 
at 
all 
is 
itself 
a 
high 
honor 
and 
a 
rare 
distinction. 
And 
when 
were 
we 
in 
greater 
need 
of 
these 
highest 
of 
all 
teachers 
than 
at 
present, 
when 
we 
are 
experiencing 
a 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy 
and 
are 
in 
danger 
alike 
of 
not 
knowing 
whence 
it 
comes 
and 
of 
being 
unable 
to 
make 
clear 
to 
ourselves 
whither 
it 
tends? 



20 


Some 
day, 
before 
an 
impartial 
judge, 
it 
may 
be 
decided 
in 
what 
time 
and 
in 
what 
men 
the 
German 
spirit 
has 
so 
far 
striven 
most 
resolutely 
to 
learn 
from 
the 
Greeks; 
and 
if 
we 
confidently 
assume 
that 
this 
unique 
praise 
must 
be 
accorded 
to 
the 
noblest 
intellectual 
efforts 
of 
Goethe, 
Schiller, 
and 
Winckelmann, 
we 
should 
certainly 
have 
to 
add 
that 
since 
their 
time 
and 
the 
more 
immediate 
consequences 
of 
their 
efforts, 
the 
endeavor 
to 
attain 
to 
culture 
and 
to 
the 
Greeks 
on 
the 
same 
path 
has 
grown 
incomprehensibly 
feebler 
and 
feebler. 
That 
we 
may 
not 
despair 
utterly 
of 
the 
German 
spirit, 
must 
we 
not 
conclude 
that, 
in 
some 
essential 
matter, 
even 
these 
champions 
did 
not 
penetrate 
into 
the 
core 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
nature, 
to 
establish 
a 
permanent 
alliance 
between 
German 
and 
Greek 
culture? 
So 
an 
unconscious 
recognition 
of 
this 
shortcoming 
may 
have 
prompted 
the 
disheartening 
doubt, 
even 
in 
very 
serious 
people, 
whether 
after 
such 
predecessors 
they 
could 
possibly 
advance 
further 
on 
this 
path 
of 
culture 
or 
could 
reach 
the 
goal 
at 
all. 
Accordingly, 
we 
see 
that 
opinions 
concerning 
the 
value 
of 
the 
Greeks 
for 
education 
have 
been 
degenerating 
in 
the 
most 
alarming 
manner 
since 
that 
time. 
Expressions 
of 
compassionate 
condescension 
may 
be 
heard 
in 
the 
most 
varied 
camps 
of 
the 
spirit—and 
of 
lack 
of 
spirit. 
Elsewhere, 
ineffectual 
rhetoric 
plays 
with 
the 
phrases 
“Greek 
harmony,” 
“Greek 
beauty,” 
“Greek 
cheerfulness.” 
And 
those 
very 
circles 
whose 
dignified 
task 
it 
might 
be 
to 
draw 
indefatigably 
from 
the 
Greek 
reservoir 
for 
the 
good 
of 
German 
culture, 
the 
teachers 
of 
the 
higher 
educational 
institutions, 
have 
learned 
best 
to 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
the 
Greeks 
easily 
and 
in 
good 
time, 
often 
by 
skeptically 
abandoning 
the 
Hellenic 
ideal 
and 
completely 
perverting 
the 
true 
purpose 
of 
antiquarian 
studies. 
Whoever 
in 
these 
circles 
has 
not 
completely 
exhausted 
himself 
in 
his 
endeavor 
to 
be 
a 
dependable 
corrector 
of 
old 
texts 
or 
a 
linguistic 
microscopist 
who 
apes 
natural 
history 
is 
probably 
trying 
to 
assimilate 
Greek 
antiquity 
“historically,” 
along 
with 
other 
antiquities, 
at 
any 
rate 
according 
to 
the 
method 
and 
with 
the 
supercilious 
airs 
of 
our 
present 
cultured 
historiography. 


The 
cultural 
power 
of 
our 
higher 
educational 
institutions 
has 
perhaps 
never 
been 
lower 
or 
feebler 
than 
at 
present. 
The 
“journalist,” 
the 
paper 
slave 
of 
the 
day, 
triumphs 
over 
the 
professor 
in 
all 
matters 
pertaining 
to 
culture; 
and 



nothing 
remains 
to 
the 
latter 
but 
the 
metamorphosis, 
often 
experienced 
by 
now, 
of 
fluttering 
also 
like 
a 
cheerful 
cultured 
butterfly, 
with 
the 
“light 
elegance” 
peculiar 
to 
this 
sphere, 
employing 
the 
journalist’s 
style. 
In 
what 
painful 
confusion 
must 
the 
cultured 
class 
of 
such 
a 
period 
gaze 
at 
the 
phenomenon 
which 
perhaps 
is 
to 
be 
comprehended 
analogically 
only 
by 
means 
of 
the 
profoundest 
principle 
of 
the 
hitherto 
unintelligible 
Hellenic 
genius—the 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
reawakening 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
spirit 
and 
the 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy? 


There 
has 
never 
been 
another 
period 
in 
the 
history 
of 
art 
in 
which 
so-called 
culture 
and 
true 
art 
have 
been 
so 
estranged 
and 
opposed 
as 
we 
may 
observe 
them 
to 
be 
at 
present. 
We 
can 
understand 
why 
so 
feeble 
a 
culture 
hates 
true 
art; 
it 
fears 
destruction 
from 
its 
hands. 
But 
has 
not 
an 
entire 
cultural 
form, 
namely, 
the 
Socratic-Alexandrian, 
exhausted 
itself 
after 
culminating 
in 
such 
a 
daintily 
tapering 
point 
as 
our 
present 
culture? 
If 
heroes 
like 
Goethe 
and 
Schiller 
could 
not 
succeed 
in 
breaking 
open 
the 
enchanted 
gate 
which 
leads 
into 
the 
Hellenic 
magic 
mountain; 
if 
with 
their 
most 
dauntless 
striving 
they 
could 
not 
go 
beyond 
the 
longing 
gaze 
which 
Goethe’s 
Iphigenia 
casts 
from 
barbaric 
Tauris 
to 
her 
home 
across 
the 
ocean, 
what 
could 
the 
epigones 
of 
such 
heroes 
hope 
for—unless, 
amid 
the 
mystic 
tones 
of 
reawakened 
tragic 
music, 
the 
gate 
should 
open 
for 
them 
suddenly 
of 
its 
own 
accord, 
from 
an 
entirely 
different 
side, 
quite 
overlooked 
in 
all 
previous 
cultural 
endeavors. 


Let 
no 
one 
try 
to 
blight 
our 
faith 
in 
a 
yet-impending 
rebirth 
of 
Hellenic 
antiquity; 
for 
this 
alone 
gives 
us 
hope 
for 
a 
renovation 
and 
purification 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
through 
the 
fire 
magic 
of 
music.1 
What 
else 
could 
we 
name 
that 
might 
awaken 
any 
comforting 
expectations 
for 
the 
future 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
desolation 
and 
exhaustion 
of 
contemporary 
culture? 
In 
vain 
we 
look 
for 
a 
single 
vigorously 
developed 
root, 
for 
a 
spot 
of 
fertile 
and 
healthy 
soil: 
everywhere 
there 
is 
dust 
and 
sand; 
everything 
has 
become 
rigid 
and 
languishes. 
One 
who 
is 
disconsolate 
and 
lonely 
could 
not 
choose 
a 
better 
symbol 
than 
the 
knight 
with 
death 
and 
devil, 
as 
Dürer 
has 
drawn 
him 
for 
us, 
the 
armored 
knight 
with 
the 
iron, 
hard 
look, 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
pursue 
his 
terrible 
path, 
undeterred 
by 
his 
gruesome 
companions, 
and 
yet 
without 
hope, 
alone 
with 
his 
horse 
and 
dog. 
Our 
Schopenhauer 
was 
such 
a 
Dürer 
knight; 
he 
lacked 
all 
hope, 
but 
he 
desired 
truth. 
He 
has 
no 
peers. 


But 
how 
suddenly 
the 
desert 
of 
our 
exhausted 
culture, 
just 
described 
in 
such 
gloomy 
terms, 
is 
changed 
when 
it 
is 
touched 
by 
the 
Dionysian 
magic! 
A 
tempest 
seizes 
everything 
that 
has 
outlived 
itself, 
everything 
that 
is 
decayed, 



broken, 
and 
withered, 
and, 
whirling, 
shrouds 
it 
in 
a 
cloud 
of 
red 
dust 
to 
carry 
it 
into 
the 
air 
like 
a 
vulture. 
Confused, 
our 
eyes 
look 
after 
what 
has 
disappeared; 
for 
what 
they 
see 
has 
been 
raised 
as 
from 
a 
depression 
into 
golden 
light, 
so 
full 
and 
green, 
so 
amply 
alive, 
immeasurable 
and 
full 
of 
yearning. 
Tragedy 
is 
seated 
amid 
this 
excess 
of 
life, 
suffering, 
and 
pleasure, 
in 
sublime 
ecstasy, 
listening 
to 
a 
distant 
melancholy 
song 
that 
tells 
of 
the 
mothers 
of 
being 
whose 
names 
are: 
Delusion, 
Will, 
Woe.2 


Yes, 
my 
friends, 
believe 
with 
me 
in 
Dionysian 
life 
and 
the 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy. 
The 
age 
of 
the 
Socratic 
man 
is 
over; 
put 
on 
wreaths 
of 
ivy, 
put 
the 
thyrsus 
into 
your 
hand, 
and 
do 
not 
be 
surprised 
when 
tigers 
and 
panthers 
lie 
down, 
fawning, 
at 
your 
feet. 
Only 
dare 
to 
be 
tragic 
men; 
for 
you 
are 
to 
be 
redeemed. 
You 
shall 
accompany 
the 
Dionysian 
pageant 
from 
India 
to 
Greece. 
Prepare 
yourselves 
for 
hard 
strife, 
but 
believe 
in 
the 
miracles 
of 
your 
god. 



21 


Returning 
from 
these 
hortatory 
tones 
to 
the 
mood 
befitting 
contemplation, 
I 
repeat 
that 
we 
can 
learn 
only 
from 
the 
Greeks 
what 
such 
an 
almost 
miraculously 
sudden 
awakening 
of 
tragedy 
means 
for 
the 
innermost 
life 
ground 
of 
a 
people. 
It 
is 
the 
people 
of 
the 
tragic 
mysteries 
that 
fights 
the 
battles 
against 
the 
Persians; 
and 
the 
people 
that 
fought 
these 
wars 
in 
turn 
needs 
tragedy 
as 
a 
necessary 
potion 
to 
recover. 
Who 
would 
have 
supposed 
that 
precisely 
this 
people, 
after 
it 
had 
been 
deeply 
agitated 
through 
several 
generations 
by 
the 
strongest 
spasms 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
demon, 
should 
still 
have 
been 
capable 
of 
such 
a 
uniformly 
vigorous 
effusion 
of 
the 
simplest 
political 
feeling, 
the 
most 
natural 
patriotic 
instincts, 
and 
original 
manly 
desire 
to 
fight? 
After 
all, 
one 
feels 
in 
every 
case 
in 
which 
Dionysian 
excitement 
gains 
any 
significant 
extent 
how 
the 
Dionysian 
liberation 
from 
the 
fetters 
of 
the 
individual 
finds 
expression 
first 
of 
all 
in 
a 
diminution 
of, 
in 
indifference 
to, 
indeed, 
in 
hostility 
to, 
the 
political 
instincts. 
Just 
as 
certainly, 
Apollo 
who 
forms 
states 
is 
also 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
principium 
individuationis, 
and 
state 
and 
patriotism 
cannot 
live 
without 
an 
affirmation 
of 
the 
individual 
personality. 
But 
from 
orgies 
a 
people 
can 
take 
one 
path 
only, 
the 
path 
to 
Indian 
Buddhism, 
and 
in 
order 
that 
this 
may 
be 
endurable 
at 
all 
with 
its 
yearning 
for 
the 
nothing, 
it 
requires 
these 
rare 
ecstatic 
states 
with 
their 
elevation 
above 
space, 
time, 
and 
the 
individual. 
These 
states 
in 
turn 
demand 
a 
philosophy 
that 
teaches 
men 
how 
to 
overcome 
by 
the 
force 
of 
an 
idea 
the 
indescribable 
displeasure 
of 
the 
states 
that 
lie 
between. 
Where 
the 
political 
drives 
are 
taken 
to 
be 
absolutely 
valid, 
it 
is 
just 
as 
necessary 
that 
a 
people 
should 
go 
the 
path 
toward 
the 
most 
extreme 
secularization 
whose 
most 
magnificent 
but 
also 
most 
terrifying 
expression 
may 
be 
found 
in 
the 
Roman 
imperium. 


Placed 
between 
India 
and 
Rome, 
and 
pushed 
toward 
a 
seductive 
choice, 
the 
Greeks 
succeeded 
in 
inventing 
a 
third 
form, 
in 
classical 
purity—to 
be 
sure, 
one 
they 
did 
not 
long 
use 
themselves, 
but 
one 
that 
precisely 
for 
that 
reason 
gained 
immortality. 
For 
that 
the 
favorites 
of 
the 
gods 
die 
early, 
is 
true 
in 
all 
things; 
but 
it 
is 
just 
as 
certain 
that 
they 
then 
live 
eternally 
with 
the 
gods. 
After 
all, 
one 
should 
not 
demand 
of 
what 
is 
noblest 
of 
all 
that 
it 
should 
have 
the 
durable 
toughness 
of 
leather. 
That 
staunch 
perseverance 
which 



characterized, 
for 
example, 
the 
national 
instincts 
of 
the 
Romans, 
probably 
does 
not 
belong 
among 
the 
necessary 
predicates 
of 
perfection. 
But 
let 
us 
ask 
by 
means 
of 
what 
remedy 
it 
was 
possible 
for 
the 
Greeks 
during 
their 
great 
period, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
extraordinary 
strength 
of 
their 
Dionysian 
and 
political 
instincts, 
not 
to 
exhaust 
themselves 
either 
in 
ecstatic 
brooding 
or 
in 
a 
consuming 
chase 
after 
worldly 
power 
and 
worldly 
honor, 
but 
rather 
to 
attain 
that 
splendid 
mixture 
which 
resembles 
a 
noble 
wine 
in 
making 
one 
feel 
fiery 
and 
contemplative 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Here 
we 
must 
clearly 
think 
of 
the 
tremendous 
power 
that 
stimulated, 
purified, 
and 
discharged 
the 
whole 
life 
of 
the 
people: 
tragedy. 
We 
cannot 
begin 
to 
sense 
its 
highest 
value 
until 
it 
confronts 
us, 
as 
it 
did 
the 
Greeks, 
as 
the 
quintessence 
of 
all 
prophylactic 
powers 
of 
healing, 
as 
the 
mediator 
that 
worked 
among 
the 
strongest 
and 
in 
themselves 
most 
fatal 
qualities 
of 
the 
people. 


Tragedy 
absorbs 
the 
highest 
ecstasies 
of 
music, 
so 
that 
it 
truly 
brings 
music, 
both 
among 
the 
Greeks 
and 
among 
us, 
to 
its 
perfection; 
but 
then 
it 
places 
the 
tragic 
myth 
and 
the 
tragic 
hero 
next 
to 
it, 
and 
he, 
like 
a 
powerful 
Titan, 
takes 
the 
whole 
Dionysian 
world 
upon 
his 
back 
and 
thus 
relieves 
us 
of 
this 
burden. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
same 
tragic 
myth, 
in 
the 
person 
of 
the 
tragic 
hero; 
it 
knows 
how 
to 
redeem 
us 
from 
the 
greedy 
thirst 
for 
this 
existence, 
and 
with 
an 
admonishing 
gesture 
it 
reminds 
us 
of 
another 
existence 
and 
a 
higher 
pleasure 
for 
which 
the 
struggling 
hero 
prepares 
himself 
by 
means 
of 
his 
destruction, 
not 
by 
means 
of 
his 
triumphs. 
Between 
the 
universal 
validity 
of 
its 
music 
and 
the 
listener, 
receptive 
in 
his 
Dionysian 
state, 
tragedy 
places 
a 
sublime 
parable, 
the 
myth, 
and 
deceives 
the 
listener 
into 
feeling 
that 
the 
music 
is 
merely 
the 
highest 
means 
to 
bring 
life 
into 
the 
vivid 
world 
of 
myth. 
Relying 
on 
this 
noble 
deception, 
it 
may 
now 
move 
its 
limbs 
in 
dithyrambic 
dances 
and 
yield 
unhesitatingly 
to 
an 
ecstatic 
feeling 
of 
freedom 
in 
which 
it 
could 
not 
dare 
to 
wallow 
as 
pure 
music 
without 
this 
deception. 
The 
myth 
protects 
us 
against 
the 
music, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
alone 
gives 
music 
the 
highest 
freedom. 
In 
return, 
music 
imparts 
to 
the 
tragic 
myth 
an 
intense 
and 
convincing 
metaphysical 
significance 
that 
word 
and 
image 
without 
this 
singular 
help 
could 
never 
have 
attained. 
And 
above 
all, 
it 
is 
through 
music 
that 
the 
tragic 
spectator 
is 
overcome 
by 
an 
assured 
premonition 
of 
a 
highest 
pleasure1 
attained 
through 
destruction 
and 
negation, 
so 
he 
feels 
as 
if 
the 
innermost 
abyss 
of 
things 
spoke 
to 
him 
perceptibly. 


If 
these 
last 
sentences 
have 
perhaps 
managed 
to 
give 
only 
a 
preliminary 
expression 
to 
these 
difficult 
ideas 
and 
are 
immediately 
intelligible 
only 
to 



few, 
I 
nevertheless 
may 
not 
desist 
at 
this 
point 
from 
trying 
to 
stimulate 
my 
friends 
to 
further 
efforts 
and 
must 
ask 
them 
to 
use 
a 
single 
example 
of 
our 
common 
experience 
in 
order 
to 
prepare 
themselves 
for 
a 
general 
insight. 
In 
giving 
this 
example, 
I 
must 
not 
appeal 
to 
those 
who 
use 
the 
images 
of 
what 
happens 
on 
the 
stage, 
the 
words 
and 
emotions 
of 
the 
acting 
persons, 
in 
order 
to 
approach 
with 
their 
help 
the 
musical 
feeling; 
for 
these 
people 
do 
not 
speak 
music 
as 
their 
mother 
tongue 
and, 
in 
spite 
of 
this 
help, 
never 
get 
beyond 
the 
entrance 
halls 
of 
musical 
perception, 
without 
ever 
being 
able 
to 
as 
much 
as 
touch 
the 
inner 
sanctum. 
Some 
of 
them, 
like 
Gervinus,2 
do 
not 
even 
reach 
the 
entrance 
halls. 
I 
must 
appeal 
only 
to 
those 
who, 
immediately 
related 
to 
music, 
have 
in 
it, 
as 
it 
were, 
their 
motherly 
womb, 
and 
are 
related 
to 
things 
almost 
exclusively 
through 
unconscious 
musical 
relations. 
To 
these 
genuine 
musicians 
I 
direct 
the 
question 
whether 
they 
can 
imagine 
a 
human 
being 
who 
would 
be 
able 
to 
perceive 
the 
third 
act 
of 
Tristan 
and 
Isolde, 
without 
any 
aid 
of 
word 
and 
image, 
purely 
as 
a 
tremendous 
symphonic 
movement, 
without 
expiring 
in 
a 
spasmodic 
unharnessing 
of 
all 
the 
wings 
of 
the 
soul? 


Suppose 
a 
human 
being 
has 
thus 
put 
his 
ear, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
the 
heart 
chamber 
of 
the 
world 
will 
and 
felt 
the 
roaring 
desire 
for 
existence 
pouring 
from 
there 
into 
all 
the 
veins 
of 
the 
world, 
as 
a 
thundering 
current 
or 
as 
the 
gentlest 
brook, 
dissolving 
into 
a 
mist—how 
could 
he 
fail 
to 
break 
suddenly? 
How 
could 
he 
endure 
to 
perceive 
the 
echo 
of 
innumerable 
shouts 
of 
pleasure 
and 
woe 
in 
the 
“wide 
space 
of 
the 
world 
night,” 
enclosed 
in 
the 
wretched 
glass 
capsule 
of 
the 
human 
individual, 
without 
inexorably 
fleeing 
toward 
his 
primordial 
home, 
as 
he 
hears 
this 
shepherd’s 
dance 
of 
metaphysics? 
But 
if 
such 
a 
work 
could 
nevertheless 
be 
perceived 
as 
a 
whole, 
without 
denial 
of 
individual 
existence; 
if 
such 
a 
creation 
could 
be 
created 
without 
smashing 
its 
creator—whence 
do 
we 
take 
the 
solution 
of 
such 
a 
contradiction? 


Here 
the 
tragic 
myth 
and 
the 
tragic 
hero 
intervene 
between 
our 
highest 
musical 
emotion 
and 
this 
music—at 
botton 
only 
as 
symbols 
of 
the 
most 
universal 
facts, 
of 
which 
only 
music 
can 
speak 
so 
directly. 
But 
if 
our 
feelings 
were 
those 
of 
entirely 
Dionysian 
beings, 
myth 
as 
a 
symbol 
would 
remain 
totally 
ineffective 
and 
unnoticed, 
and 
would 
never 
for 
a 
moment 
keep 
us 
from 
listening 
to 
the 
re-echo 
of 
the 
universalia 
ante 
rem.3 
Yet 
here 
the 
Apollinian 
power 
erupts 
to 
restore 
the 
almost 
shattered 
individual 
with 
the 
healing 
balm 
of 
blissful 
illusion: 
suddenly 
we 
imagine 
we 
see 
only 
Tristan, 
motionless, 
asking 
himself 
dully: 
“The 
old 
tune, 
why 
does 
it 
wake 
me?” 
And 
what 
once 
seemed 
to 
us 
like 
a 
hollow 
sigh 
from 
the 
core 
of 
being 
now 
merely 



wants 
to 
tell 
us 
how 
“desolate 
and 
empty 
the 
sea.”4 
And 
where, 
breathless, 
we 
once 
thought 
we 
were 
being 
extinguished 
in 
a 
convulsive 
distention 
of 
all 
our 
feelings, 
and 
little 
remained 
to 
tie 
us 
to 
our 
present 
existence, 
we 
now 
hear 
and 
see 
only 
the 
hero 
wounded 
to 
death, 
yet 
not 
dying, 
with 
his 
despairing 
cry: 
“Longing! 
Longing! 
In 
death 
still 
longing! 
for 
very 
longing 
not 
dying!” 
And 
where, 
formerly 
after 
such 
an 
excess 
and 
superabundance 
of 
consuming 
agonies, 
the 
jubilation 
of 
the 
horn 
cut 
through 
our 
hearts 
almost 
like 
the 
ultimate 
agony, 
the 
rejoicing 
Kurwenal 
now 
stands 
between 
us 
and 
this 
“jubilation 
in 
itself,” 
his 
face 
turned 
toward 
the 
ship 
which 
carries 
Isolde. 
However 
powerfully 
pity 
affects 
us, 
it 
nevertheless 
saves 
us 
in 
a 
way 
from 
the 
primordial 
suffering 
of 
the 
world, 
just 
as 
the 
symbolic 
image 
of 
the 
myth 
saves 
us 
from 
the 
immediate 
perception 
of 
the 
highest 
world-idea, 
just 
as 
thought 
and 
word 
save 
us 
from 
the 
uninhibited 
effusion 
of 
the 
unconscious 
will. 
The 
glorious 
Apollinian 
illusion 
makes 
it 
appear 
as 
if 
even 
the 
tone 
world 
confronted 
us 
as 
a 
sculpted 
world, 
as 
if 
the 
fate 
of 
Tristan 
and 
Isolde 
had 
been 
formed 
and 
molded 
in 
it, 
too, 
as 
in 
an 
exceedingly 
tender 
and 
expressive 
material. 


Thus 
the 
Apollinian 
tears 
us 
out 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
universality 
and 
lets 
us 
find 
delight 
in 
individuals; 
it 
attaches 
our 
pity 
to 
them, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
them 
it 
satisfies 
our 
sense 
of 
beauty 
which 
longs 
for 
great 
and 
sublime 
forms; 
it 
presents 
images 
of 
life 
to 
us, 
and 
incites 
us 
to 
comprehend 
in 
thought 
the 
core 
of 
life 
they 
contain. 
With 
the 
immense 
impact 
of 
the 
image, 
the 
concept, 
the 
ethical 
teaching, 
and 
the 
sympathetic 
emotion, 
the 
Apollinian 
tears 
man 
from 
his 
orgiastic 
self-annihilation 
and 
blinds 
him 
to 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
process, 
deluding 
him 
into 
the 
belief 
that 
he 
is 
seeing 
a 
single 
image 
of 
the 
world 
(Tristan 
and 
Isolde, 
for 
instance), 
and 
that, 
through 
music, 
he 
is 
merely 
supposed 
to 
see 
it 
still 
better 
and 
more 
profoundly. 
What 
can 
the 
healing 
magic 
of 
Apollo 
not 
accomplish 
when 
it 
can 
even 
create 
the 
illusion 
that 
the 
Dionysian 
is 
really 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
capable 
of 
enhancing 
its 
effects—as 
if 
music 
were 
essentially 
the 
art 
of 
presenting 
an 
Apollinian 
content? 


By 
means 
of 
the 
pre-established 
harmony 
between 
perfect 
drama 
and 
its 
music, 
the 
drama 
attains 
a 
superlative 
vividness 
unattainable 
in 
mere 
spoken 
drama. 
In 
the 
independently 
moving 
lines 
of 
the 
melody 
all 
the 
living 
figures 
of 
the 
scene 
simplify 
themselves 
before 
us 
to 
the 
distinctness 
of 
curved 
lines, 
and 
the 
harmonies 
of 
these 
lines 
sympathize 
in 
a 
most 
delicate 
manner 
with 
the 
events 
on 
the 
stage. 
These 
harmonies 
make 
the 
relations 
of 
things 



immediately 
perceptible 
to 
us 
in 
a 
sensuous, 
by 
no 
means 
abstract 
manner, 
and 
thus 
we 
perceive 
that 
it 
is 
only 
in 
these 
relations 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
a 
character 
and 
of 
a 
melodic 
line 
is 
revealed 
clearly. 
And 
while 
music 
thus 
compels 
us 
to 
see 
more 
and 
more 
profoundly 
than 
usual, 
and 
we 
see 
the 
action 
on 
the 
stage 
as 
a 
delicate 
web, 
the 
world 
of 
the 
stage 
is 
expanded 
infinitely 
and 
illuminated 
for 
our 
spiritualized 
eye. 
How 
could 
a 
word-poet 
furnish 
anything 
analogous, 
when 
he 
strives 
to 
attain 
this 
internal 
expansion 
and 
illumination 
of 
the 
visible 
stage-world 
by 
means 
of 
a 
much 
more 
imperfect 
mechanism, 
indirectly, 
proceeding 
from 
word 
and 
concept? 
Although 
musical 
tragedy 
also 
avails 
itself 
of 
the 
word, 
it 
can 
at 
the 
same 
time 
place 
beside 
it 
the 
basis 
and 
origin 
of 
the 
word, 
making 
the 
development 
of 
the 
word 
clear 
to 
us, 
from 
the 
inside. 


Concerning 
the 
process 
just 
described, 
however, 
we 
may 
still 
say 
with 
equal 
assurance 
that 
it 
is 
merely 
a 
glorious 
appearance, 
namely, 
the 
aforementioned 
Apollinian 
illusion 
whose 
influence 
aims 
to 
deliver 
us 
from 
the 
Dionysian 
flood 
and 
excess. 
For, 
at 
bottom, 
the 
relation 
of 
music 
to 
drama 
is 
precisely 
the 
reverse: 
music 
is 
the 
real 
idea 
of 
the 
world, 
drama 
is 
but 
the 
reflection 
of 
this 
idea, 
a 
single 
silhouette 
of 
it. 
The 
identity 
between 
the 
melody 
and 
the 
living 
figure, 
between 
the 
harmony 
and 
the 
character 
relations 
of 
that 
figure, 
is 
true 
in 
a 
sense 
opposite 
to 
what 
one 
would 
suppose 
on 
the 
contemplation 
of 
musical 
tragedy. 
Even 
if 
we 
agitate 
and 
enliven 
the 
figure 
in 
the 
most 
visible 
manner, 
and 
illuminate 
it 
from 
within, 
it 
still 
remains 
merely 
a 
phenomenon 
from 
which 
no 
bridge 
leads 
us 
to 
true 
reality, 
into 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
world. 
But 
music 
speaks 
out 
of 
this 
heart; 
and 
though 
countless 
phenomena 
of 
the 
kind 
were 
to 
accompany 
this 
music, 
they 
could 
never 
exhaust 
its 
essence, 
but 
would 
always 
be 
nothing 
more 
than 
its 
externalized 
copies. 


As 
for 
the 
intricate 
relationship 
of 
music 
and 
drama, 
nothing 
can 
be 
explained, 
while 
everything 
may 
be 
confused, 
by 
the 
popular 
and 
thoroughly 
false 
contrast 
of 
soul 
and 
body; 
but 
the 
unphilosophical 
crudeness 
of 
this 
contrast 
seems 
to 
have 
become—who 
knows 
for 
what 
reasons—a 
readily 
accepted 
article 
of 
faith 
among 
our 
aestheticians, 
while 
they 
have 
learned 
nothing 
of 
the 
contrast 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
and 
the 
thing-in-itself—or, 
for 
equally 
unknown 
reasons, 
have 
not 
cared 
to 
learn 
anything 
about 
it. 


Should 
our 
analysis 
have 
established 
that 
the 
Apollinian 
element 
in 
tragedy 
has 
by 
means 
of 
its 
illusion 
gained 
a 
complete 
victory 
over 
the 
primoridal 
Dionysian 
element 
of 
music, 
making 
music 
subservient 
to 
its 
aims, 
namely, 



to 
make 
the 
drama 
as 
vivid 
as 
possible—it 
would 
certainly 
be 
necessary 
to 
add 
a 
very 
important 
qualification: 
at 
the 
most 
essential 
point 
this 
Apollinian 
illusion 
is 
broken 
and 
annihilated. 
The 
drama 
that, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
music, 
unfolds 
itself 
before 
us 
with 
such 
inwardly 
illumined 
distinctness 
in 
all 
its 
movements 
and 
figures, 
as 
if 
we 
saw 
the 
texture 
coming 
into 
being 
on 
the 
loom 
as 
the 
shuttle 
flies 
to 
and 
fro—attains 
as 
a 
whole 
an 
effect 
that 
transcends 
all 
Apollinian 
artistic 
effects. 
In 
the 
total 
effect 
of 
tragedy, 
the 
Dionysian 
predominates 
once 
again. 
Tragedy 
closes 
with 
a 
sound 
which 
could 
never 
come 
from 
the 
realm 
of 
Apollinian 
art. 
And 
thus 
the 
Apollinian 
illusion 
reveals 
itself 
as 
what 
it 
really 
is—the 
veiling 
during 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
tragedy 
of 
the 
real 
Dionysian 
effect; 
but 
the 
latter 
is 
so 
powerful 
that 
it 
ends 
by 
forcing 
the 
Apollinian 
drama 
itself 
into 
a 
sphere 
where 
it 
begins 
to 
speak 
with 
Dionysian 
wisdom 
and 
even 
denies 
itself 
and 
its 
Apollinian 
visibility. 
Thus 
the 
intricate 
relation 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian 
in 
tragedy 
may 
really 
be 
symbolized 
by 
a 
fraternal 
union 
of 
the 
two 
deities: 
Dionysus 
speaks 
the 
language 
of 
Apollo; 
and 
Apollo, 
finally 
the 
language 
of 
Dionysus; 
and 
so 
the 
highest 
goal 
of 
tragedy 
and 
of 
all 
art 
is 
attained.

Let 
the 
attentive 
friend 
imagine 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
true 
musical 
tragedy 
purely 
and 
simply, 
as 
he 
knows 
it 
from 
experience. 
I 
think 
I 
have 
so 
portrayed 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
this 
effect 
in 
both 
its 
phases 
that 
he 
can 
now 
interpret 
his 
own 
experiences. 
For 
he 
will 
recollect 
how 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
myth 
which 
passed 
in 
front 
of 
him, 
he 
felt 
himself 
exalted 
to 
a 
kind 
of 
omniscience, 
as 
if 
his 
visual 
faculty 
were 
no 
longer 
merely 
a 
surface 
faculty 
but 
capable 
of 
penetrating 
into 
the 
interior, 
and 
as 
if 
he 
now 
saw 
before 
him, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
music, 
the 
waves 
of 
the 
will, 
the 
conflict 
of 
motives, 
and 
the 
swelling 
flood 
of 
the 
passions, 
sensuously 
visible, 
as 
it 
were, 
like 
a 
multitude 
of 
vividly 
moving 
lines 
and 
figures; 
and 
he 
felt 
he 
could 
dip 
into 
the 
most 
delicate 
secrets 
of 
unconscious 
emotions. 
While 
he 
thus 
becomes 
conscious 
of 
the 
highest 
exaltation 
of 
his 
instincts 
for 
clarity 
and 
transfiguration, 
he 
nevertheless 
feels 
just 
as 
definitely 
that 
this 
long 
series 
of 
Apollinian 
artistic 
effects 
still 
does 
not 
generate 
that 
blessed 
continuance 
in 
will-less 
contemplation 
which 
the 
plastic 
artist 
and 
the 
epic 
poet, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
strictly 
Apollinian 
artists, 
evoke 
in 
him 
with 
their 
artistic 
productions: 
to 
wit, 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
world 
of 
the 
individuatio 
attained 
by 
this 
contemplation—which 
is 
the 
climax 
and 
essence 
of 
Apollinian 
art. 
He 
beholds 
the 
transfigured 
world 
of 
the 
stage 
and 
nevertheless 
denies 
it. 
He 
sees 
the 
tragic 
hero 
before 
him 
in 
epic 
clearness 
and 
beauty, 
and 
nevertheless 
rejoices 
in 
his 
annihilation. 
He 
comprehends 
the 
action 
deep 
down, 
and 
yet 
likes 
to 
flee 
into 
the 
incomprehensible. 
He 
feels 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
hero 
to 
be 
justified, 
and 
is 
nevertheless 
still 
more 
elated 
when 
these 
actions 
annihilate 
their 
agent. 
He 
shudders 
at 
the 
sufferings 
which 
will 
befall 
the 
hero, 
and 
yet 
anticipates 
in 
them 
a 
higher, 
much 
more 
overpowering 
joy. 
He 
sees 
more 
extensively 
and 
profoundly 
than 
ever, 
and 
yet 
wishes 
he 
were 
blind. 


How 
must 
we 
derive 
this 
curious 
internal 
bifurcation, 
this 
blunting 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
point, 
if 
not 
from 
the 
Dionysian 
magic 
that, 
though 
apparently 
exciting 
the 
Apollinian 
emotions 
to 
their 
highest 
pitch, 
still 
retains 
the 
power 
to 
force 
into 
its 
service 
his 
excess 
of 
Apollinian 
force? 


The 
tragic 
myth 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
only 
as 
a 
symbolization 
of 
Dionysian 
wisdom 
through 
Apollinian 
artifices. 
The 
myth 
leads 
the 
world 
of 
phenomena 



to 
its 
limits 
where 
it 
denies 
itself 
and 
seeks 
to 
flee 
back 
again 
into 
the 
womb 
of 
the 
true 
and 
only 
reality, 
where 
it 
then 
seems 
to 
commence 
its 
metaphysical 
swansong, 
like 
Isolde: 


In 
the 
rapture 
ocean’s 


billowing 
roll, 


in 
the 
fragrance 
waves’ 


ringing 
sound, 


in 
the 
world 
breath’s 


wafting 
whole— 


to 
drown, 
to 
sink— 


unconscious—highest 
joy!1 


Thus 
we 
use 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
truly 
aesthetic 
listener 
to 
bring 
to 
mind 
the 
tragic 
artist 
himself 
as 
he 
creates 
his 
figures 
like 
a 
fecund 
divinity 
of 
individuation 
(so 
his 
work 
can 
hardly 
be 
understood 
as 
an 
“imitation 
of 
nature”) 
and 
as 
his 
vast 
Dionysian 
impulse 
then 
devours 
his 
entire 
world 
of 
phenomena, 
in 
order 
to 
let 
us 
sense 
beyond 
it, 
and 
through 
its 
destruction, 
the 
highest 
artistic 
primal 
joy, 
in 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
primordially 
One. 
Of 
course, 
our 
aestheticians 
have 
nothing 
to 
say 
about 
this 
return 
to 
the 
primordial 
home, 
or 
the 
fraternal 
union 
of 
the 
two 
art-deities, 
nor 
of 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
hearer 
which 
is 
Apollinian 
as 
well 
as 
Dionysian; 
but 
they 
never 
tire 
of 
characterizing 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
hero 
with 
fate, 
the 
triumph 
of 
the 
moral 
world 
order, 
or 
the 
purgation 
of 
the 
emotions 
through 
tragedy, 
as 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
tragic. 
And 
their 
indefatigability 
makes 
me 
think 
that 
perhaps 
they 
are 
not 
aesthetically 
sensitive 
at 
all, 
but 
react 
merely 
as 
moral 
beings 
when 
listening 
to 
a 
tragedy. 


Never 
since 
Aristotle 
has 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
tragic 
effect 
been 
offered 
from 
which 
aesthetic 
states 
or 
an 
aesthetic 
activity 
of 
the 
listener 
could 
be 
inferred. 
Now 
the 
serious 
events 
are 
supposed 
to 
prompt 
pity 
and 
fear 
to 
discharge 
themselves 
in 
a 
way 
that 
relieves 
us; 
now 
we 
are 
supposed 
to 
feel 
elevated 
and 
inspired 
by 
the 
triumph 
of 
good 
and 
noble 
principles, 
at 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
hero 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
a 
moral 
vision 
of 
the 
universe. 
I 
am 
sure 
that 
for 
countless 
men 
precisely 
this, 
and 
only 
this, 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
tragedy, 
but 
it 
plainly 
follows 
that 
all 
these 
men, 
together 
with 
their 
interpreting 
aestheticians, 
have 
had 
no 
experience 
of 
tragedy 
as 
a 
supreme 
art. 


The 
pathological 
discharge, 
the 
catharsis 
of 
Aristotle, 
of 
which 
philologists 



are 
not 
sure 
whether 
it 
should 
be 
included 
among 
medical 
or 
moral 
phenomena, 
recalls 
a 
remarkable 
notion 
of 
Goethe’s. 
“Without 
a 
lively 
pathological 
interest,” 
he 
says, 
“I, 
too, 
have 
never 
yet 
succeeded 
in 
elaborating 
a 
tragic 
situation 
of 
any 
kind, 
and 
hence 
I 
have 
rather 
avoided 
than 
sought 
it. 
Can 
it 
perhaps 
have 
been 
yet 
another 
merit 
of 
the 
ancients 
that 
the 
deepest 
pathos 
was 
with 
them 
merely 
aesthetic 
play, 
while 
with 
us 
the 
truth 
of 
nature 
must 
co-operate 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
such 
a 
work?” 


We 
can 
now 
answer 
this 
profound 
final 
question 
in 
the 
affirmative 
after 
our 
glorious 
experiences, 
having 
found 
to 
our 
astonishment 
that 
the 
deepest 
pathos 
can 
indeed 
be 
merely 
aesthetic 
play 
in 
the 
case 
of 
musical 
tragedy. 
Therefore 
we 
are 
justified 
in 
believing 
that 
now 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
primal 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
tragic 
can 
be 
described 
with 
some 
degree 
of 
success. 
Anyone 
who 
still 
persists 
in 
talking 
only 
of 
those 
vicarious 
effects 
proceeding 
from 
extra-aesthetic 
spheres, 
and 
who 
does 
not 
feel 
that 
he 
is 
above 
the 
pathological-moral 
process, 
should 
despair 
of 
his 
aesthetic 
nature: 
should 
we 
recommend 
to 
him 
as 
an 
innocent 
equivalent 
the 
interpretation 
of 
Shakespeare 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
Gervinus 
and 
the 
diligent 
search 
for 
poetic 
justice?2 


Thus 
the 
aesthetic 
listener 
is 
also 
reborn 
with 
the 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy. 
In 
his 
place 
in 
the 
theater, 
a 
curious 
quid 
pro 
quo3 
used 
to 
sit 
with 
half 
moral 
and 
half 
scholarly 
pretensions—the 
“critic.” 
Everything 
in 
his 
sphere 
so 
far 
has 
been 
artificial 
and 
merely 
whitewashed 
with 
an 
appearance 
of 
life. 
The 
performing 
artist 
was 
really 
at 
a 
loss 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
a 
listener 
who 
comported 
himself 
so 
critically; 
so 
he, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
dramatist 
or 
operatic 
composer 
who 
inspired 
him, 
searched 
anxiously 
for 
the 
last 
remains 
of 
life 
in 
a 
being 
so 
pretentiously 
barren 
and 
incapable 
of 
enjoyment. 
So 
far, 
however, 
such 
“critics” 
have 
constituted 
the 
audience: 
the 
student, 
the 
schoolboy, 
even 
the 
most 
innocuous 
female 
had 
been 
unwittingly 
prepared 
by 
education 
and 
newspapers 
for 
this 
kind 
of 
perception 
of 
works 
of 
art. 
Confronted 
with 
such 
a 
public, 
the 
nobler 
natures 
among 
the 
artists 
counted 
upon 
exciting 
their 
moral-religious 
emotions, 
and 
the 
appeal 
to 
the 
moral 
world-order 
intervened 
vicariously 
where 
some 
powerful 
artistic 
magic 
ought 
to 
enrapture 
the 
genuine 
listener. 
Or 
some 
more 
imposing, 
or 
at 
all 
events 
exciting, 
trend 
of 
the 
contemporary 
political 
and 
social 
world 
was 
so 
vividly 
presented 
by 
the 
dramatist 
that 
the 
listener 
could 
forget 
his 
critical 
exhaustion 
and 
abandon 
himself 
to 
emotions 
similar 
to 
those 
felt 
in 
patriotic 
or 
warlike 
moments, 
or 
before 
the 
tribune 
of 
parliament, 
or 
at 
the 
condemnation 
of 
crime 
and 
vice— 



an 
alienation 
from 
the 
true 
aims 
of 
art 
that 
sometimes 
had 
to 
result 
in 
an 
outright 
cult 
of 
tendentiousness. 
But 
what 
happened 
next 
is 
what 
has 
always 
happened 
to 
all 
artificial 
arts: 
a 
rapid 
degeneration 
of 
such 
tendentiousness. 
The 
attempt, 
for 
example, 
to 
use 
the 
theater 
as 
an 
institution 
for 
the 
moral 
education 
of 
the 
people, 
still 
taken 
seriously 
in 
Schiller’s 
time, 
is 
already 
reckoned 
among 
the 
incredible 
antiques 
of 
a 
dated 
type 
of 
education. 
While 
the 
critic 
got 
the 
upper 
hand 
in 
the 
theater 
and 
concert 
hall, 
the 
journalist 
in 
the 
schools, 
and 
the 
press 
in 
society, 
art 
degenerated 
into 
a 
particularly 
lowly 
topic 
of 
conversation, 
and 
aesthetic 
criticism 
was 
used 
as 
a 
means 
of 
uniting 
a 
vain, 
distracted, 
selfish, 
and 
moreover 
piteously 
unoriginal 
sociability 
whose 
character 
is 
suggested 
by 
Schopenhauer’s 
parable 
of 
the 
porcupines.4 
As 
a 
result, 
art 
has 
never 
been 
so 
much 
talked 
about 
and 
so 
little 
esteemed. 
But 
is 
it 
still 
possible 
to 
have 
intercourse 
with 
a 
person 
capable 
of 
conversing 
about 
Beethoven 
or 
Shakespeare?5 
Let 
each 
answer 
this 
question 
according 
to 
his 
own 
feelings: 
he 
will 
at 
any 
rate 
show 
by 
his 
answer 
his 
conception 
of 
“culture,” 
provided 
he 
at 
least 
tries 
to 
answer 
the 
question, 
and 
has 
not 
already 
become 
dumfounded 
with 
astonishment. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
many 
a 
being 
more 
nobly 
and 
delicately 
endowed 
by 
nature, 
though 
he 
may 
have 
gradually 
become 
a 
critical 
barbarian 
in 
the 
manner 
described, 
might 
have 
something 
to 
say 
about 
the 
unexpected 
as 
well 
as 
totally 
unintelligible 
effect 
that 
a 
successful 
performance 
of 
Lohengrin, 
for 
example, 
had 
on 
him—except 
that 
perhaps 
there 
was 
no 
helpful 
interpreting 
hand 
to 
guide 
him; 
so 
the 
incomprehensibly 
different 
and 
altogether 
incomparable 
sensation 
that 
thrilled 
him 
remained 
isolated 
and, 
like 
a 
mysterious 
star, 
became 
extinct 
after 
a 
short 
period 
of 
brilliance. 
But 
it 
was 
then 
that 
he 
had 
an 
inkling 
of 
what 
an 
aesthetic 
listener 
is. 



23 


Whoever 
wishes 
to 
test 
rigorously 
to 
what 
extent 
he 
himself 
is 
related 
to 
the 
true 
aesthetic 
listener 
or 
belongs 
to 
the 
community 
of 
the 
Socratic-critical 
persons 
needs 
only 
to 
examine 
sincerely 
the 
feeling 
with 
which 
he 
accepts 
miracles 
represented 
on 
the 
stage: 
whether 
he 
feels 
his 
historical 
sense, 
which 
insists 
on 
strict 
psychological 
causality, 
insulted 
by 
them, 
whether 
he 
makes 
a 
benevolent 
concession 
and 
admits 
the 
miracle 
as 
a 
phenomenon 
intelligible 
to 
childhood 
but 
alien 
to 
him, 
or 
whether 
he 
experiences 
anything 
else. 
For 
in 
this 
way 
he 
will 
be 
able 
to 
determine 
to 
what 
extent 
he 
is 
capable 
of 
understanding 
myth 
as 
a 
concentrated 
image 
of 
the 
world 
that, 
as 
a 
condensation 
of 
phenomena, 
cannot 
dispense 
with 
miracles. 
It 
is 
probable, 
however, 
that 
almost 
everyone, 
upon 
close 
examination, 
finds 
that 
the 
critical-historical 
spirit 
of 
our 
culture 
has 
so 
affected 
him 
that 
he 
can 
only 
make 
the 
former 
existence 
of 
myth 
credible 
to 
himself 
by 
means 
of 
scholarship, 
through 
intermediary 
abstractions. 
But 
without 
myth 
every 
culture 
loses 
the 
healthy 
natural 
power 
of 
its 
creativity: 
only 
a 
horizon 
defined 
by 
myths 
completes 
and 
unifies 
a 
whole 
cultural 
movement. 
Myth 
alone 
saves 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
imagination 
and 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
dream 
from 
their 
aimless 
wanderings. 
The 
images 
of 
the 
myth 
have 
to 
be 
the 
unnoticed 
omnipresent 
demonic 
guardians, 
under 
whose 
care 
the 
young 
soul 
grows 
to 
maturity 
and 
whose 
signs 
help 
the 
man 
to 
interpret 
his 
life 
and 
struggles. 
Even 
the 
state 
knows 
no 
more 
powerful 
unwritten 
laws 
than 
the 
mythical 
foundation 
that 
guarantees 
its 
connection 
with 
religion 
and 
its 
growth 
from 
mythical 
notions. 


By 
way 
of 
comparison 
let 
us 
now 
picture 
the 
abstract 
man, 
untutored 
by 
myth; 
abstract 
education; 
abstract 
morality; 
abstract 
law; 
the 
abstract 
state; 
let 
us 
imagine 
the 
lawless 
roving 
of 
the 
artistic 
imagination, 
unchecked 
by 
any 
native 
myth; 
let 
us 
think 
of 
a 
culture 
that 
has 
no 
fixed 
and 
sacred 
primordial 
site 
but 
is 
doomed 
to 
exhaust 
all 
possibilities 
and 
to 
nourish 
itself 
wretchedly 
on 
all 
other 
cultures—there 
we 
have 
the 
present 
age, 
the 
result 
of 
that 
Socratism 
which 
is 
bent 
on 
the 
destruction 
of 
myth. 
And 
now 
the 
mythless 
man 
stands 
eternally 
hungry, 
surrounded 
by 
all 
past 
ages, 
and 
digs 
and 
grubs 
for 
roots, 
even 
if 
he 
has 
to 
dig 
for 
them 
among 
the 
remotest 
antiquities. 
The 



tremendous 
historical 
need 
of 
our 
unsatisfied 
modern 
culture, 
the 
assembling 
around 
one 
of 
countless 
other 
cultures, 
the 
consuming 
desire 
for 
knowledge 
—what 
does 
all 
this 
point 
to, 
if 
not 
to 
the 
loss 
of 
myth, 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
mythical 
home, 
the 
mythical 
maternal 
womb? 
Let 
us 
ask 
ourselves 
whether 
the 
feverish 
and 
uncanny 
excitement 
of 
this 
culture 
is 
anything 
but 
the 
greedy 
seizing 
and 
snatching 
at 
food 
of 
a 
hungry 
man—and 
who 
would 
care 
to 
contribute 
anything 
to 
a 
culture 
that 
cannot 
be 
satisfied 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
it 
devours, 
and 
at 
whose 
contact 
the 
most 
vigorous 
and 
wholesome 
nourishment 
is 
changed 
into 
“history 
and 
criticism”? 


We 
should 
also 
have 
to 
regard 
our 
German 
character 
with 
sorrowful 
despair, 
if 
it 
had 
already 
become 
inextricably 
entangled 
in, 
or 
even 
identical 
with, 
its 
culture, 
as 
we 
may 
observe 
to 
our 
horror 
in 
the 
case 
of 
civilized 
France. 
What 
for 
a 
long 
time 
was 
the 
great 
advantage 
of 
France 
and 
the 
cause 
of 
her 
vast 
superiority, 
namely, 
this 
very 
identity 
of 
people 
and 
culture, 
might 
compel 
us 
in 
view 
of 
this 
sight 
to 
congratulate 
ourselves 
that 
this 
so 
questionable 
culture 
of 
ours 
has 
as 
yet 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
the 
noble 
core 
of 
our 
people’s 
character.1 
On 
the 
contrary, 
all 
our 
hopes 
stretch 
out 
longingly 
toward 
the 
perception 
that 
beneath 
this 
restlessly 
palpitating 
cultural 
life 
and 
convulsion 
there 
is 
concealed 
a 
glorious, 
intrinsically 
healthy, 
primordial 
power 
that, 
to 
be 
sure, 
stirs 
vigorously 
only 
at 
intervals 
in 
stupendous 
moments, 
and 
then 
continues 
to 
dream 
of 
a 
future 
awakening. 
It 
is 
from 
this 
abyss 
that 
the 
German 
Reformation 
came 
forth; 
and 
in 
its 
chorales 
the 
future 
tune 
of 
German 
music 
resounded 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
So 
deep, 
courageous, 
and 
spiritual, 
so 
exuberantly 
good 
and 
tender 
did 
this 
chorale 
of 
Luther 
sound—as 
the 
first 
Dionysian 
luring 
call 
breaking 
forth 
from 
dense 
thickets 
at 
the 
approach 
of 
spring. 
And 
in 
competing 
echoes 
the 
solemnly 
exuberant 
procession 
of 
Dionysian 
revelers 
responded, 
to 
whom 
we 
are 
indebted 
for 
German 
music—and 
to 
whom 
we 
shall 
be 
indebted 
for 
the 
rebirth 
of 
German 
myth. 


I 
know 
that 
I 
must 
now 
lead 
the 
sympathizing 
and 
attentive 
friend 
to 
an 
elevated 
position 
of 
lonely 
contemplation, 
where 
he 
will 
have 
but 
few 
companions, 
and 
I 
call 
out 
encouragingly 
to 
him 
that 
we 
must 
hold 
fast 
to 
our 
luminous 
guides, 
the 
Greeks. 
To 
purify 
our 
aesthetic 
insight, 
we 
have 
previously 
borrowed 
from 
them 
the 
two 
divine 
figures 
who 
rule 
over 
separate 
realms 
of 
art, 
and 
concerning 
whose 
mutual 
contact 
and 
enhancement 
we 
have 
acquired 
some 
notion 
through 
Greek 
tragedy. 
It 
had 
to 
appear 
to 
us 
that 
the 
demise 
of 
Greek 
tragedy 
was 
brought 
about 
through 
a 
remarkable 
and 



forcible 
dissociation 
of 
these 
two 
primordial 
artistic 
drives. 
To 
this 
process 
there 
corresponded 
a 
degeneration 
and 
transformation 
of 
the 
character 
of 
the 
Greek 
people, 
which 
calls 
for 
serious 
reflection 
on 
how 
necessary 
and 
close 
the 
fundamental 
connections 
are 
between 
art 
and 
the 
people, 
myth 
and 
custom, 
tragedy 
and 
the 
state. 
This 
demise 
of 
tragedy 
was 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
demise 
of 
myth. 
Until 
then 
the 
Greeks 
had 
felt 
involuntarily 
impelled 
to 
relate 
all 
their 
experiences 
immediately 
to 
their 
myths, 
indeed 
to 
understand 
them 
only 
in 
this 
relation. 
Thus 
even 
the 
immediate 
present 
had 
to 
appear 
to 
them 
right 
away 
sub 
specie 
aeterni2 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
as 
timeless. 


But 
the 
state 
no 
less 
than 
art 
dipped 
into 
this 
current 
of 
the 
timeless 
to 
find 
rest 
in 
it 
from 
the 
burden 
and 
the 
greed 
of 
the 
moment. 
And 
any 
people—just 
as, 
incidentally, 
also 
any 
individual—is 
worth 
only 
as 
much 
as 
it 
is 
able 
to 
press 
upon 
its 
experiences 
the 
stamp 
of 
the 
eternal; 
for 
thus 
it 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
desecularized 
and 
shows 
its 
unconscious 
inward 
convictions 
of 
the 
relativity 
of 
time 
and 
of 
the 
true, 
that 
is 
metaphysical, 
significance 
of 
life. 
The 
opposite 
of 
this 
happens 
when 
a 
people 
begins 
to 
comprehend 
itself 
historically 
and 
to 
smash 
the 
mythical 
works 
that 
surround 
it. 
At 
that 
point 
we 
generally 
find 
a 
decisive 
secularization, 
a 
break 
with 
the 
unconscious 
metaphysics 
of 
its 
previous 
existence, 
together 
with 
all 
its 
ethical 
consequences. 
Greek 
art 
and 
pre-eminently 
Greek 
tragedy 
delayed 
above 
all 
the 
destruction 
of 
myth. 
One 
had 
to 
destroy 
tragedy, 
too, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
live 
away 
from 
the 
soil 
of 
home, 
uninhibited, 
in 
the 
wilderness 
of 
thought, 
custom, 
and 
deed. 
Even 
now 
this 
metaphysical 
drive 
still 
tries 
to 
create 
for 
itself 
a 
certainly 
attenuated 
form 
of 
transfiguration, 
in 
the 
Socratism 
of 
science 
that 
strives 
for 
life; 
but 
on 
the 
lower 
steps, 
this 
same 
drive 
led 
only 
to 
a 
feverish 
search 
that 
gradually 
lost 
itself 
in 
a 
pandemonium 
of 
myths 
and 
superstitions 
that 
were 
collected 
from 
all 
over 
and 
piled 
up 
in 
confusion: 
nevertheless 
the 
Greek 
sat 
among 
them 
with 
an 
unstilled 
heart 
until 
he 
learned 
to 
mask 
this 
fever 
with 
Greek 
cheerfulness 
and 
Greek 
frivolity, 
becoming 
a 
Graeculus,3 
or 
he 
numbed 
his 
mind 
completely 
in 
some 
dark 
Oriental 
superstition. 


Since 
the 
reawakening 
of 
Alexandrian-Roman 
antiquity 
in 
the 
fifteenth 
century 
we 
have 
approximated 
this 
state 
in 
the 
most 
evident 
manner, 
after 
a 
long 
interlude 
that 
is 
difficult 
to 
describe. 
On 
the 
heights 
we 
encounter 
the 
same 
overabundant 
lust 
for 
knowledge, 
the 
same 
unsatisfied 
delight 
in 
discovery, 
the 
same 
tremendous 
secularization, 
and 
beside 
it 
a 
homeless 
roving, 
a 
greedy 
crowding 
around 
foreign 
tables, 
a 
frivolous 
deification 
of 
the 
present, 
or 
a 
dully 
dazed 
retreat—everything 
sub 
specie 
saeculi,4 
of 
the 



“present 
age.” 
And 
these 
same 
symptoms 
allow 
us 
to 
infer 
the 
same 
lack 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
this 
culture, 
the 
destruction 
of 
myth. 
It 
scarcely 
seems 
possible 
to 
be 
continually 
successful 
at 
transplanting 
a 
foreign 
myth 
without 
irreparably 
damaging 
the 
tree 
by 
this 
transplantation. 
In 
one 
case 
it 
may 
perhaps 
be 
strong 
and 
healthy 
enough 
to 
eliminate 
this 
foreign 
element 
in 
a 
terrible 
fight; 
usually, 
however, 
it 
must 
consume 
itself, 
sick 
and 
withered 
or 
in 
diseased 
superfoetation. 


We 
think 
so 
highly 
of 
the 
pure 
and 
vigorous 
core 
of 
the 
German 
character 
that 
we 
dare 
to 
expect 
of 
it 
above 
all 
others 
this 
elimination 
of 
the 
forcibly 
implanted 
foreign 
elements, 
and 
consider 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
German 
spirit 
will 
return 
to 
itself. 
Some 
may 
suppose 
that 
this 
spirit 
must 
begin 
its 
fight 
with 
the 
elimination 
of 
everything 
Romanic. 
If 
so 
they 
may 
recognize 
an 
external 
preparation 
and 
encouragement 
in 
the 
victorious 
fortitude 
and 
bloody 
glory 
of 
the 
last 
war; 
but 
one 
must 
still 
seek 
the 
inner 
necessity 
in 
the 
ambition 
to 
be 
always 
worthy 
of 
the 
sublime 
champions 
on 
this 
way, 
Luther 
as 
well 
as 
our 
great 
artists 
and 
poets. 
But 
let 
him 
never 
believe 
that 
he 
could 
fight 
similar 
fights 
without 
the 
gods 
of 
his 
house, 
or 
his 
mythical 
home, 
without 
“bringing 
back” 
all 
German 
things! 
And 
if 
the 
German 
should 
hesitantly 
look 
around 
for 
a 
leader 
who 
might 
bring 
him 
back 
again 
into 
his 
long 
lost 
home 
whose 
ways 
and 
paths 
he 
scarcely 
knows 
anymore, 
let 
him 
merely 
listen 
to 
the 
ecstatically 
luring 
call 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
bird 
that 
hovers 
above 
him 
and 
wants 
to 
point 
the 
way 
for 
him. 



24 


Among 
the 
peculiar 
art 
effects 
of 
musical 
tragedy 
we 
had 
to 
emphasize 
an 
Apollinian 
illusion 
by 
means 
of 
which 
we 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
saved 
from 
the 
immediate 
unity 
with 
Dionysian 
music, 
while 
our 
musical 
excitement 
could 
discharge 
itself 
in 
an 
Apollinian 
field 
and 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
visible 
intermediary 
world 
that 
had 
been 
interposed. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
thought 
that 
we 
had 
observed 
how 
precisely 
through 
this 
discharge 
the 
intermediary 
world 
of 
the 
action 
on 
the 
stage, 
and 
the 
drama 
in 
general, 
had 
been 
made 
visible 
and 
intelligible 
from 
the 
inside 
to 
a 
degree 
that 
in 
all 
other 
Apollinian 
art 
remains 
unattained. 
Where 
the 
Apollinian 
receives 
wings 
from 
the 
spirit 
of 
music 
and 
soars, 
we 
thus 
found 
the 
highest 
intensification 
of 
its 
powers, 
and 
in 
this 
fraternal 
union 
of 
Apollo 
and 
Dionysus 
we 
had 
to 
recognize 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Dionysian 
aims 
of 
art. 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
Apollinian 
projection 
that 
is 
thus 
illuminated 
from 
inside 
by 
music 
does 
not 
achieve 
the 
peculiar 
effect 
of 
the 
weaker 
degrees 
of 
Apollinian 
art. 
What 
the 
epic 
or 
the 
animated 
stone 
can 
do, 
compelling 
the 
contemplative 
eye 
to 
find 
calm 
delight 
in 
the 
world 
of 
individuation, 
that 
could 
not 
be 
attained 
here, 
in 
spite 
of 
a 
higher 
animation 
and 
clarity. 
We 
looked 
at 
the 
drama 
and 
with 
penetrating 
eye 
reached 
its 
inner 
world 
of 
motives—and 
yet 
we 
felt 
as 
if 
only 
a 
parable 
passed 
us 
by, 
whose 
most 
profound 
meaning 
we 
almost 
thought 
we 
could 
guess 
and 
that 
we 
wished 
to 
draw 
away 
like 
a 
curtain 
in 
order 
to 
behold 
the 
primordial 
image 
behind 
it. 
The 
brightest 
clarity 
of 
the 
image 
did 
not 
suffice 
us, 
for 
this 
seemed 
to 
wish 
just 
as 
much 
to 
reveal 
something 
as 
to 
conceal 
something. 
Its 
revelation, 
being 
like 
a 
parable, 
seemed 
to 
summon 
us 
to 
tear 
the 
veil 
and 
to 
uncover 
the 
mysterious 
background; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
this 
all-illuminated 
total 
visibility 
cast 
a 
spell 
over 
the 
eyes 
and 
prevented 
them 
from 
penetrating 
deeper. 


Those 
who 
have 
never 
had 
the 
experience 
of 
having 
to 
see 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
they 
also 
longed 
to 
transcend 
all 
seeing 
will 
scarcely 
be 
able 
to 
imagine 
how 
definitely 
and 
clearly 
these 
two 
processes 
coexist 
and 
are 
felt 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
as 
one 
contemplates 
the 
tragic 
myth. 
But 
all 
truly 
aesthetic 
spectators 
will 
confirm 
that 
among 
the 
peculiar 
effects 
of 
tragedy 
this 
coexistence 
is 
the 



most 
remarkable. 
Now 
transfer 
this 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
spectator 
into 
an 
analogous 
process 
in 
the 
tragic 
artist, 
and 
you 
will 
have 
understood 
the 
genesis 
of 
the 
tragic 
myth. 
With 
the 
Apollinian 
art 
sphere 
he 
shares 
the 
complete 
pleasure 
in 
mere 
appearance 
and 
in 
seeing, 
yet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
negates 
this 
pleasure 
and 
finds 
a 
still 
higher 
satisfaction 
in 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
visible 
world 
of 
mere 
appearance. 


The 
content 
of 
the 
tragic 
myth 
is, 
first 
of 
all, 
an 
epic 
event 
and 
the 
glorification 
of 
the 
fighting 
hero. 
But 
what 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
this 
enigmatic 
trait 
that 
the 
suffering 
and 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
hero, 
the 
most 
painful 
triumphs, 
the 
most 
agonizing 
oppositions 
of 
motives, 
in 
short, 
the 
exemplification 
of 
this 
wisdom 
of 
Silenus, 
or, 
to 
put 
it 
aesthetically, 
that 
which 
is 
ugly 
and 
disharmonic, 
is 
represented 
ever 
anew 
in 
such 
countless 
forms 
and 
with 
such 
a 
distinct 
preference—and 
precisely 
in 
the 
most 
fruitful 
and 
youthful 
period 
of 
a 
people? 
Surely 
a 
higher 
pleasure 
must 
be 
perceived 
in 
all 
this. 


That 
life 
is 
really 
so 
tragic 
would 
least 
of 
all 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
an 
art 
form—assuming 
that 
art 
is 
not 
merely 
imitation 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
nature 
but 
rather 
a 
metaphysical 
supplement 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
nature, 
placed 
beside 
it 
for 
its 
overcoming. 
The 
tragic 
myth, 
too, 
insofar 
as 
it 
belongs 
to 
art 
at 
all, 
participates 
fully 
in 
this 
metaphysical 
intention 
of 
art 
to 
transfigure. 
But 
what 
does 
it 
transfigure 
when 
it 
presents 
the 
world 
of 
appearance 
in 
the 
image 
of 
the 
suffering 
hero? 
Least 
of 
all 
the 
“reality” 
of 
this 
world 
of 
appearance, 
for 
it 
says 
to 
us: 
“Look 
there! 
Look 
closely! 
This 
is 
your 
life, 
this 
is 
the 
hand 
on 
the 
clock 
of 
your 
existence.” 


And 
the 
myth 
should 
show 
us 
this 
life 
in 
order 
to 
thus 
transfigure 
it 
for 
us? 
But 
if 
not, 
in 
what 
then 
lies 
the 
aesthetic 
pleasure 
with 
which 
we 
let 
these 
images, 
too, 
pass 
before 
us? 
I 
ask 
about 
the 
aesthetic 
pleasure, 
though 
I 
know 
full 
well 
that 
many 
of 
these 
images 
also 
produce 
at 
times 
a 
moral 
delight, 
for 
example, 
under 
the 
form 
of 
pity 
or 
moral 
triumph. 
But 
those 
who 
would 
derive 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
tragic 
solely 
from 
these 
moral 
sources—which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
has 
been 
the 
custom 
in 
aesthetics 
all 
too 
long—should 
least 
of 
all 
believe 
that 
they 
have 
thus 
accomplished 
something 
for 
art, 
which 
above 
all 
must 
demand 
purity 
in 
its 
sphere. 
If 
you 
would 
explain 
the 
tragic 
myth, 
the 
first 
requirement 
is 
to 
seek 
the 
pleasure 
that 
is 
peculiar 
to 
it 
in 
the 
purely 
aesthetic 
sphere, 
without 
transgressing 
into 
the 
region 
of 
pity, 
fear, 
or 
the 
morally 
sublime. 
How 
can 
the 
ugly 
and 
the 
disharmonic, 
the 
content 
of 
the 
tragic 
myth, 
stimulate 
aesthetic 
pleasure? 


Here 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
take 
a 
bold 
running 
start 
and 
leap 
into 
a 



metaphysics 
of 
art, 
by 
repeating 
the 
sentence 
written 
above,1 
that 
existence 
and 
the 
world 
seem 
justified 
only 
as 
an 
aesthetic 
phenomenon. 
In 
this 
sense, 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
tragic 
myth 
that 
has 
to 
convince 
us 
that 
even 
the 
ugly 
and 
disharmonic 
are 
part 
of 
an 
artistic 
game 
that 
the 
will 
in 
the 
eternal 
amplitude 
of 
its 
pleasure 
plays 
with 
itself. 
But 
this 
primordial 
phenomenon 
of 
Dionysian 
art 
is 
difficult 
to 
grasp, 
and 
there 
is 
only 
one 
direct 
way 
to 
make 
it 
intelligible 
and 
grasp 
it 
immediately: 
through 
the 
wonderful 
significance 
of 
musical 
dissonance. 
Quite 
generally, 
only 
music, 
placed 
beside 
the 
world, 
can 
give 
us 
an 
idea 
of 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
world 
as 
an 
aesthetic 
phenomenon. 
The 
joy 
aroused 
by 
the 
tragic 
myth 
has 
the 
same 
origin 
as 
the 
joyous 
sensation 
of 
dissonance 
in 
music. 
The 
Dionysian, 
with 
its 
primordial 
joy 
experienced 
even 
in 
pain, 
is 
the 
common 
source 
of 
music 
and 
tragic 
myth. 


Is 
it 
not 
possible 
that 
by 
calling 
to 
our 
aid 
the 
musical 
relation 
of 
dissonance 
we 
may 
meanwhile 
have 
made 
the 
difficult 
problem 
of 
the 
tragic 
effect 
much 
easier? 
For 
we 
now 
understand 
what 
it 
means 
to 
wish 
to 
see 
tragedy 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
long 
to 
get 
beyond 
all 
seeing: 
referring 
to 
the 
artistically 
employed 
dissonances, 
we 
should 
have 
to 
characterize 
the 
corresponding 
state 
by 
saying 
that 
we 
desire 
to 
hear 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
long 
to 
get 
beyond 
all 
hearing. 
That 
striving 
for 
the 
infinite, 
the 
wing-beat 
of 
longing 
that 
accompanies 
the 
highest 
delight 
in 
clearly 
perceived 
reality, 
reminds 
us 
that 
in 
both 
states 
we 
must 
recognize 
a 
Dionysian 
phenomenon: 
again 
and 
again 
it 
reveals 
to 
us 
the 
playful 
construction 
and 
destruction 
of 
the 
individual 
world 
as 
the 
overflow 
of 
a 
primordial 
delight. 
Thus 
the 
dark 
Heraclitus 
compares 
the 
world-building 
force 
to 
a 
playing 
child 
that 
places 
stones 
here 
and 
there 
and 
builds 
sand 
hills 
only 
to 
overthrow 
them 
again. 


In 
order, 
then, 
to 
form 
a 
true 
estimate 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
capacity 
of 
a 
people, 
we 
must 
think 
not 
only 
of 
their 
music, 
but 
also 
just 
as 
necessarily 
of 
their 
tragic 
myth, 
as 
the 
second 
witness 
of 
this 
capacity. 
Considering 
this 
extremely 
close 
relationship 
between 
music 
and 
myth, 
one 
must 
suppose 
that 
a 
degeneration 
and 
depravation 
of 
the 
one 
will 
involve 
a 
deterioration 
of 
the 
other, 
if 
the 
weakening 
of 
the 
myth 
really 
expresses 
a 
weakening 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
capacity. 
Concerning 
both, 
however, 
a 
glance 
at 
the 
development 
of 
the 
German 
character 
should 
not 
leave 
us 
in 
any 
doubt. 
In 
the 
opera, 
just 
as 
in 
the 
abstract 
character 
of 
our 
mythless 
existence, 
in 
an 
art 
degenerated 
to 
mere 
entertainment 
as 
well 
as 
in 
a 
life 
guided 
by 
concepts, 
the 
inartistic 
as 
well 
as 
life-consuming 
nature 
of 
Socratic 
optimism 
had 
revealed 
itself 
to 
us. 



Yet 
we 
were 
comforted 
by 
indications 
that 
nevertheless 
in 
some 
inaccessible 
abyss 
the 
German 
spirit 
still 
rests 
and 
dreams, 
undestroyed, 
in 
glorious 
health, 
profundity, 
and 
Dionysian 
strength, 
like 
a 
knight 
sunk 
in 
slumber; 
and 
from 
this 
abyss 
the 
Dionysian 
song 
rises 
to 
our 
ears 
to 
let 
us 
know 
that 
this 
German 
knight 
is 
still 
dreaming 
his 
primordial 
Dionysian 
myth 
in 
blissfully 
serious 
visions. 
Let 
no 
one 
believe 
that 
the 
German 
spirit 
has 
forever 
lost 
its 
mythical 
home 
when 
it 
can 
still 
understand 
so 
plainly 
the 
voices 
of 
the 
birds 
that 
tell 
of 
that 
home. 
Some 
day 
it 
will 
find 
itself 
awake 
in 
all 
the 
morning 
freshness 
following 
a 
tremendous 
sleep: 
then 
it 
will 
slay 
dragons, 
destroy 
vicious 
dwarfs,2 
wake 
Brünnhilde—and 
even 
Wotan’s 
spear 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
stop 
its 
course! 


My 
friends, 
you 
who 
believe 
in 
Dionysian 
music, 
you 
also 
know 
what 
tragedy 
means 
to 
us. 
There 
we 
have 
tragic 
myth 
reborn 
from 
music—and 
in 
this 
myth 
we 
can 
hope 
for 
everything 
and 
forget 
what 
is 
most 
painful. 
What 
is 
most 
painful 
for 
all 
of 
us, 
however, 
is—the 
prolonged 
degradation 
in 
which 
the 
German 
genius 
has 
lived, 
estranged 
from 
house 
and 
home, 
in 
the 
service 
of 
vicious 
dwarfs. 
You 
understand 
my 
words—as 
you 
will 
also, 
in 
conclusion, 
understand 
my 
hopes. 



25 


Music 
and 
tragic 
myth 
are 
equally 
expressions 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
capacity 
of 
a 
people, 
and 
they 
are 
inseparable.1 
Both 
derive 
from 
a 
sphere 
of 
art 
that 
lies 
beyond 
the 
Apollinian; 
both 
transfigure 
a 
region 
in 
whose 
joyous 
chords 
dissonance 
as 
well 
as 
the 
terrible 
image 
of 
the 
world 
fade 
away 
charmingly; 
both 
play 
with 
the 
sting 
of 
displeasure, 
trusting 
in 
their 
exceedingly 
powerful 
magic 
arts; 
and 
by 
means 
of 
this 
play 
both 
justify 
the 
existence 
of 
even 
the 
“worst 
world.” 
Thus 
the 
Dionysian 
is 
seen 
to 
be, 
compared 
to 
the 
Apollinian, 
the 
eternal 
and 
original 
artistic 
power 
that 
first 
calls 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
phenomena 
into 
existence—and 
it 
is 
only 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
world 
that 
a 
new 
transfiguring 
illusion2 
becomes 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
the 
animated 
world 
of 
individuation 
alive. 


If 
we 
could 
imagine 
dissonance 
become 
man—and 
what 
else 
is 
man?— 
this 
dissonance, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
live, 
would 
need 
a 
splendid 
illusion3 
that 
would 
cover 
dissonance 
with 
a 
veil 
of 
beauty. 
This 
is 
the 
true 
artistic 
aim 
of 
Apollo 
in 
whose 
name 
we 
comprehend 
all 
those 
countless 
illusions 
of 
the 
beauty 
of 
mere 
appearance4 
that 
at 
every 
moment 
make 
life 
worth 
living 
at 
all 
and 
prompt 
the 
desire 
to 
live 
on 
in 
order 
to 
experience 
the 
next 
moment. 


Of 
this 
foundation 
of 
all 
existence—the 
Dionysian 
basic 
ground 
of 
the 
world—not 
one 
whit 
more 
may 
enter 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
human 
individual 
than 
can 
be 
overcome 
again 
by 
this 
Apollinian 
power 
of 
transfiguration. 
Thus 
these 
two 
art 
drives 
must 
unfold 
their 
powers 
in 
a 
strict 
proportion, 
according 
to 
the 
law 
of 
eternal 
justice. 
Where 
the 
Dionysian 
powers 
rise 
up 
as 
impetuously 
as 
we 
experience 
them 
now, 
Apollo, 
too, 
must 
already 
have 
descended 
among 
us, 
wrapped 
in 
a 
cloud; 
and 
the 
next 
generation 
will 
probably 
behold 
his 
most 
ample 
beautiful 
effects. 


That 
this 
effect 
should 
be 
necessary, 
everybody 
should 
be 
able 
to 
feel 
most 
assuredly 
by 
means 
of 
intuition, 
provided 
he 
has 
ever 
felt, 
if 
only 
in 
a 
dream, 
that 
he 
was 
carried 
back 
into 
an 
ancient 
Greek 
existence. 
Walking 
under 
lofty 
Ionic 
colonnades, 
looking 
up 
toward 
a 
horizon 
that 
was 
cut 
off 
by 
pure 
and 
noble 
lines, 
finding 
reflections 
of 
his 
transfigured 
shape 
in 
the 
shining 
marble 
at 
his 
side, 
and 
all 
around 
him 
solemnly 
striding 
or 
delicately 
moving 
human 



beings, 
speaking 
with 
harmonious 
voices 
and 
in 
a 
rhythmic 
language 
of 
gestures—in 
view 
of 
this 
continual 
influx 
of 
beauty, 
would 
he 
not 
have 
to 
exclaim, 
raising 
his 
hand 
to 
Apollo: 
“Blessed 
people 
of 
Hellas! 
How 
great 
must 
Dionysus 
be 
among 
you 
if 
the 
god 
of 
Delos 
considers 
such 
magic 
necessary 
to 
heal 
your 
dithyrambic 
madness!” 


To 
a 
man 
in 
such 
a 
mood, 
however, 
an 
old 
Athenian, 
looking 
up 
at 
him 
with 
the 
sublime 
eyes 
of 
Aeschylus, 
might 
reply: 
“But 
say 
this, 
too, 
curious 
stranger: 
how 
much 
did 
this 
people 
have 
to 
suffer 
to 
be 
able 
to 
become 
so 
beautiful! 
But 
now 
follow 
me 
to 
witness 
a 
tragedy, 
and 
sacrifice 
with 
me 
in 
the 
temple 
of 
both 
deities!”

It 
would 
seem 
that

here 
seen 
as

Here 
Nietzsche’s 
emancipation 
from 
Schopenhauer 
becomes 
evident, 
and 
their 
difference 
from 
each 
other 
concerns 
the 
central 
subject 
of 
the 
whole 
book: 
the 
significance 
of 
tragedy. 
Nietzsche 
writes 
about 
tragedy 
as 
the 
great 
life-affirming 
alternative 
to 
Schopenhauer’s 
negation 
of 
the 
will. 
One 
can 
be 
as 
honest 
and 
free 
of 
optimistic 
illusions 
as 
Schopenhauer 
was, 
and 
still 
celebrate 
life 
as 
fundamentally 
powerful 
and 
pleasurable 
as 
the 
Greeks 
did. 


4 
Having 
finally 
broken 
loose 
from 
Schopenhauer, 
Nietzsche 
for 
the 
first 
time 
shows 
the 
brilliancy 
of 
his 
own 
genius. 
It 
is 
doubtful 
whether 
anyone 
before 
him 
had 
illuminated 
Hamlet 
so 
extensively 
in 
so 
few 
words: 
the 
passage 
invites 
comparison 
with 
Freud’s 
great 
footnote 
on 
Hamlet 
in 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
Die 
Traumdeutung 
(interpretation 
of 
dreams), 
1900. 
Even 
more 
obviously, 
the 
last 
three 
paragraphs 
invite 
comparison 
with 
existentialist 
literature, 
notably, 
but 
by 
no 
means 
only, 
Sartre’s 
La 
Nausée 
(1938).

word

to 
Schopenhauer’s 
perspective.

“The 
Greek 
theatre 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
originally 
designed 
for 
the 
performance 
of 
dithyrambic 
choruses 
in 
honour 
of 
Dionysus. 
The 
centre 
of 
it 
was 
the 
orchēstrā 
(‘dancing-place’), 
a 
circular 
space, 
in 
the 



middle 
of 
which 
stood 
the 
thumelē 
or 
altar 
of 
the 
god. 
Round 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
orchestra, 
forming 
a 
kind 
of 
horse-shoe, 
was 
the 
theātron 
(‘seeing-place’) 
proper, 
circular 
tiers 
of 
seats, 
generally 
cut 
out 
of 
the 
side 
of 
a 
hill 
… 
Behind 
the 
orchestra 
and 
facing 
the 
audience 
was 
the 
skēnē 
[called 
“scene” 
in 
the 
above 
translation], 
originally 
a 
wooden 
structure, 
a 
façade 
with 
three 
doors, 
through 
which, 
when 
the 
drama 
had 
developed 
from 
the 
dithyrambic 
chorus, 
the 
actors 
made 
their 
entrances”

Oxford 
Companion 
to 
Classical 
Literature,

The

also 
mean 
shudder, 
the 
shudder 
of 
holy 
awe; 
and 
while 
this 
is 
certainly 
not 
the 
primary 
meaning 
intended 
here, 
it 
somehow 
enters 
into 
the 
coloring 
of 
the

Übersehen, 
like 
overlook, 
can 
mean 
both 
survey

Francis 
Golffing, 
in 
his 
translation, 
opts 
for 
“quite 
literally 
survey,” 
which 
makes 
nonsense 
of 
the 
passage. 
The 
context 
unequivocally 
requires 
oblivion 
of 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
culture: 
nothing 
is 
between 
the 
beholder 
and 
the 
chorus. 
Golffing’s 
translation 
is 
altogether 
more 
vigorous 
than 
it 
is 
reliable.

further.

After

Nietzsche

“Aryan”

more 
problematic.

The 
chief 
representative 
of 
the 
so-called 
Old 
Comedy 
was 
Aristophanes 
(about 
448–380 
B.C.). 
“The 
New 
Comedy 
began 
to 
prevail 
about 
336; 
its 
characteristic 
features 
are 
the 
representation 
of 
contemporary 
life 
by 
means 
of 
imaginary 
persons 
drawn 
from 
it, 
the 
development 
of 
plot 
and 
character, 
the 
substitution 
of 
humour 
for 
wit, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
romantic 
love 
as 
a 
theme. 
It 
resembles 
the 
tragedy 
of 
Euripides 
(the 
‘Ion’ 
for 
example) 
more 
than 
the 
comedy 
of 
Aristophanes. 
Of 
the 
chorus 
no 
more 
remains 
than 
a 
band 
of 
musicians 
and 
dancers 
whose 
performances 
punctuate 
intervals 
in 
the 
play. 
The 
New 
Comedy 
is 
in 
fact 
an 
obvious 
progenitor 
of 
the 
modern 
drama. 
But 
the 
moral 
standard 
is 
surprisingly 
low.…”

Aristotle 
had 
called 
Euripides 
“the 
most 
tragic 
of 
the 
poets” 
(Poetics 
1453a). 
Although 
Nietzsche 
has 
more 
feeling 
for 
poetry—and 
tragedy—than 
Aristotle 
did, 
this 
estimate 
seems 
fairer 
than 
Nietzsche’s 
conception 
of 
Euripides 
as 
the 
most 
optimistic. 
Surely, 
Euripides 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
“he 
who 
is 
virtuous 
is 
happy”—on 
the 
contrary—and 
the 



superabundance 
of 
dialectical 
fireworks 
in 
his 
tragedies, 
though 
it 
does 
dissipate 
the 
tragic 
emotion, 
usually 
illustrates 
the 
futility 
of 
reason, 
its 
inability 
to 
prevent 
tragedy.

Lynceus, 
one 
of 
the 
Argonauts, 
was 
so 
sharp-sighted 
he 
could 
see 
through 
the 
earth 
and 
distinguish 
objects 
almost 
ten 
miles 
away. 
Although 
the 
German 
word 
for 
“lynx” 
is 
Luchs 
and 
Nietzsche 
writes 
Lynkeusaugen, 
previous 
translations 
say 
“Lynx 
eyes.” 


2 
Previous 
translations 
have 
missed 
Nietzsche’s 
point. 
The 
best 
commentary 
on 
his 
contrast 
is 
found 
in 
section 
4 
of 
the 
Preface 
to 
The 
Gay 
Science, 
reprinted 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
681— 
683). 
In 
this 
beautiful 
passage 
Nietzsche 
takes 
issue 
with 
those 
who 
“want 
by 
all 
means 
to 
unveil, 
uncover 
… 
We 
no 
longer 
believe 
that 
truth 
remains 
truth 
when 
the 
veils 
are 
withdrawn.” 
We 
have 
learned 
“to 
stop 
courageously 
at 
the 
surface, 
the 
fold, 
the 
skin, 
to 
adore 
appearance, 
to 
believe 
in 
forms, 
tones, 
words, 
in 
the 
whole 
Olympus 
of 
appearance. 
Those 
Greeks 
were 
superficial—out 
of 
profundity.… 
Are 
we 
not, 
precisely 
in 
this 
respect, 
Greeks? 
Adorers 
of 
forms, 
of 
tones, 
of 
words? 
And 
therefore—artists?”

“Not 
the 
truth 
in 
whose 
possession 
any 
man 
is, 
or 
thinks 
he 
is, 
but 
the 
honest 
effort 
he 
has 
made 
to 
find 
out 
the 
truth, 
is 
what 
constitutes 
the 
worth 
of 
a 
man. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
through 
the 
possession 
but 
through 
the 
inquiry 
after 
truth 
that 
his 
powers 
expand, 
and 
in 
this 
alone 
consists 
his 
ever 
growing 
perfection. 
Possession 
makes 
calm, 
lazy, 
proud— 


“If 
God 
had 
locked 
up 
all 
truth 
in 
his 
right 
hand, 
and 
in 
his 
left 
the 
unique, 
ever-live 
striving 
for 
truth, 
albeit 
with 
the 
addition 
that 
I 
should 
always 
and 
eternally 
err, 
and 
he 
said 
to 
me, 
‘Choose!’—I 
should 
humbly 
clasp 
his 
left 
hand, 
saying: 
‘Father, 
give! 
Pure 
truth 
is 
after 
all 
for 
thee 
alone!’

also 
became

This

Even

the

near 
the

of

this 
is 
surely 
an 
idealized 
self-portrait: 
Nietzsche 
played 
the 
piano 
and 
composed 
songs.

The 
book 
might 
well 
end 
at 
this 
point—as 
the 
original 
version 
did: 
Friedrich 
Nietzsche: 
Socrates 
und 
die 
griechische 
Tragödie: 
Ursprüngliche 
Fassung 
der

Music), 
ed. 
Hans 
Joachim 
Mette 
(Munich, 
Beck, 
1933). 
The 
discussion 
of 
the 
birth 
and 
death 
of 
tragedy 
is 
finished 
in 
the 
main, 
and 
the 
following 
celebration 
of 
the 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy 
weakens 
the 
book 
and 
was 
shortly 
regretted 
by 
Nietzsche 
himself.

An

to 
Goethe’s

Nietzsche 
clearly 
did 
not 
mean 
to 
imply 
that 
all 
music 
is 
“Dionysian.” 
Yet 
it 
did 
not 
occur 
to 
him 
at 
this 
time 
to 
consider 
Mozart’s 
music 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
Wagner’s. 
Mozart 
is 
not 
mentioned 
in 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy. 
He 
is 
mentioned 
elsewhere 
by 
the 
young 
Nietzsche, 
and 
all 
references 
express 
love 
and 
admiration. 
But 
it 
was 
only 
in 
1880, 
in 
The 
Wanderer 
and 
His 
Shadow 
(section 
165), 
after 
his 
break 
with 
Wagner, 
that 
Nietzsche 
offered 
a 
contrast 
of 
Wagner 
and 
Mozart 
in 
one 
of 
his 
books—without 
mentioning 
Wagner 
by 
name. 
Eventually, 
he 
included 
this 
passage 
and 
some 
comparable 
ones 
from 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
(1886) 
in 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner. 
When 
it 
occurred 
to 
Nietzsche 
that 
Mozart’s 
music 
was 
not 
Dionysian, 
he 
also 



realized 
that 
Wagner’s 
music 
was 
not 
really 
“Dionysian” 
either, 
but 
rather 
“romantic” 
and 
“decadent.” 
See 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
(in 
The 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
especially 
pp. 
667ff.) 
and 
section 
370 
of 
The 
Gay 
Science 
(in 
Kaufmann, 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
12, 
section 
V).

Entartete

the 
term 
was 
made 
infamous 
by 
the 
Nazis 
when 
they 
subsumed 
under 
it 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
modern 
art 
which 
was 
officially 
proscribed. 
But 
the 
Nazis 
wanted 
“beautiful 
forms” 
and 
raged 
against 
art 
which 
did 
not 
aim 
at 
“beauty,” 
while 
Nietzsche 
criticizes 
the 
assumption 
that 
all 
art 
must 
aim 
at 
“beautiful 
forms.”

text 
for 
note

All 
editions 
published 
by 
Nietzsche 
himself 
contain 
these 
words, 
and 
Wilamowitz 
cited 
this 
passage 
both 
in 
1872 
(p. 
6) 
and 
in 
1873 
(p. 
6). 
The 
standard 
editions 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
collected 
works 
substitute 
“an 
Indian 
(Brahmanic) 
culture” 
for 
“Buddhistic 
culture.” 
According 
to 
volume 
I 
(p. 
599) 
of 
the 
so-called 
Grossoktav 
edition 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
Werke 
(1905), 
this 
change 
is 
based 
on 
“a 
penciled 
correction 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
hand 
in 
his 
copy 
of 
the 
second 
version.” 
It 
would 
seem 
that 
both 
“Buddhistic” 
and 
“Brahmanic” 
depend 
on 
some 
misconception; 
neither 
seems 
to 
make 
much 
sense.

It 
is 
not 
uncommon 
to 
distinguish 
the 
Alexandrian 
period 
of 
Greek 
literature 
from 
the 
immediately 
preceding 
Attic 
period. 
The 
great 
tragic 
poets, 
as 
well 
as 
Thucydides, 
Plato, 
and 
Aristotle 
are 
associated 
with 
Athens 
and 
belong 
to 
the 
immensely 
creative 
fifth 
and 
fourth 
centuries, 
along 
with 
Phidias 
and 
Praxiteles. 
The 
glories 
of 
Alexandria, 
the 
intellectual 
capital 
of 
the 
Hellenic 
world 
from 
about 
300 
to 
30 
B.c., 
include 
no 
remotely 
comparable 
creative 
achievements 
but 
are 
its 
immense 
library, 
which 
far 
surpassed 
any 
previous 
collection, 
and 
its 
often 
exceedingly 
erudite 
scholars. 
To 
be 
sure, 
one 
still 
wrote 
poetry 
and 
vast 
amounts 
of 
prose, 
but 
on 
the 
whole 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
scientists 
and 
scholars 
were 
more 
remarkable. 
Nietzsche 
is 
plainly 
suggesting 
that 
nineteenth-century 
Germany 
is 
in 
important 
respects 
strikingly 
similar 
to 
Alexandrian 
civilization.

Otto 
Jahn 
was 
born 
in 
1813, 
like 
Nietzsche’s 
father, 
Richard 
Wagner, 
and 
Kierkegaard, 
and 
died 
in 
1869. 
He 
was 
a 
professor 
of 
classical 
philology 
at 
Bonn, 
first 
a 
friend 
and 
later 
a 
foe 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
teacher 
Ritschl. 
His 
many 
publications 
included 
articles 
on 
Greek 
tragedies 
and 
on 
ancient 
sculptures 
and 
vase 
paintings, 
a 
life 
of 
Mozart, 
and 
essays 
on 
music. 
To 
explain 
the 
above 
remark, 
it 
may 
be 
relevant 
to 
recall 
a 
passage 
in 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
letters 
to 
Rohde, 
October 
8, 
1868: 
“Recently 
I 
have 
also 
read 
… 
Jahn’s 
essays 
on 
music, 
including 
those 
on 
Wagner. 
It 
requires 
some 
enthusiasm 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
such 
a 
man, 
while 
Jahn 
has 
an 
instinctive 
aversion 
and 
listens 
only 
with 
ears 
that 
are 
half 
plugged. 
Nevertheless 
I 
agree 
with 
him 
on 
many 
points; 
especially 
insofar 
as 
he 
considers 
Wagner 
the 
representative 
of 
a 
modern 
dilettantism 
that 
absorbs 
and 
digests 
all 
artistic 
interests. 
But 
precisely 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view 
one 
can 
hardly 
be 
astonished 
enough 
at 
how 
imposing 
every 
single 
artistic 
talent 
is 
in 
this 
man, 
and 
what 
inexhaustible 
energy 
is 
here 
coupled 
with 
such 
many-sided 
artistic 
talents, 
while 
‘education,’ 
the 
more 
motley 
and 
comprehensive 
it 
is, 
usually 
appears 
with 
weak 
eyes, 
feeble 
legs, 
and 
unnerved 
loins. 
Moreover, 
Wagner 
has 
a 
dimension 
of 
feelings 
that 
remains 
altogether 
hidden 
from 
O. 
Jahn: 
Jahn 
simply 
remains 
a 
… 
healthy 
man 
for 
whom 
the 
myth 
of 
Tannhäuser 
and 
the 
atmosphere 
of 
Lohengrin 
remain 
a 
closed 
world. 
What 
I 
like 
about 
Wagner 
is 
what 
I 
like 
about 
Schopenhauer: 
the 
ethical 
air, 
the 
Faustian 
fragrance, 
cross, 
death, 
and 
tomb, 
etc.”

This 
request 
that 
no

our 
faith

very 
sharply 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
later 
attitude 
toward 
faith.

The 
parable 
is 
found 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Schopenhauer’s 
Parerga 
und 
Paralipom-ena, 
vol. 
II 
(1851), 
section 
396: 
“On 
a 
cold 
winter 
day, 
a 
group 
of 
porcupines 
huddled 
together 
closely 
to 
save 
themselves 
by 
their 
mutual 
warmth 
from 
freezing. 
But 
soon 
they 
felt 
the 
mutual 
quills 
and 
drew 
apart. 
Whenever 
the 
need 
for 
warmth 
brought 
them 
closer 
together 
again, 
this 
second 
evil 
was 
repeated, 
so 
that 
they 
were 
tossed 
back 
and 
forth 
between 
these 
two 
kinds 
of 
suffering 
until 
they 
discovered 
a 
moderate 
distance 
that 
proved 
most 
tolerable.— 
Thus 
the 
need 
for 
company, 
born 
of 
the 
emptiness 
and 
monotony 
inside 
them, 
drives 
men 
together; 
but 
their 
many 
revolting 
qualities 
and 
intolerable 
faults 
repel 
them 
again. 
The 
medium 
distance 
that 
they 
finally 
discover 
and 
that 
makes 
association 
possible 
is 
politeness 
and 
good 
manners. 
Whoever 
does 
not 
keep 
this 
distance 
is 
told, 
among 
the 
British: 
keep 
your 
distance!— 
To 
be 
sure, 
this 
only 
permits 
imperfect 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
need 
for 
mutual 
warmth, 
but 
it 
also 
keeps 
one 
from 
feeling 
the 
prick 
of 
the 
quills.— 
But 
whoever 
possesses 
much 
inner 
warmth 
of 
his 
own 



will 
prefer 
to 
avoid 
company 
lest 
he 
cause 
or 
suffer 
annoyance.” 
I 
have 
quoted 
this 
parable 
in 
its 
entirety; 
keep 
your 
distance 
is 
English 
in 
the 
original.

Cf. 
T. 
S. 
Eliot’s 
“Love 
Song 
of 
J.

“In

women 
come 
and 
go/Talking 
of

1 
This 
pro-German 
and 
anti-French 
passage 
echoes 
Wagner 
and 
is 
utterly 
at 
odds 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
later 
works. 
Indeed, 
even 
his 
second 
book, 
the 
essay 
on 
David 
Strauss 
(1873), 
published 
the 
year 
after 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
The 
Birth, 
begins 
with 
“the 
bad 
and 
dangerous 
consequences 
of 
the 
war” 
of 
1870–71; 
and 
the 
first 
paragraph 
ends 
with 
the 
prospect 
of 
“the 
defeat—yes, 
the 
extirpation 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
‘German 
Reich.’ 
“ 
After 
his 
break 
with 
Wagner, 
Nietzsche 
expressed 
his 
admiration 
for 
the 
French 
again 
and 
again; 
and 
no 
major 
German 
writer 
has 
ever 
equaled 
Nietzsche’s 
stringent 
criticisms 
of 
his 
own 
people.

prehistory; 
first, 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
ruling 
tribes 
and 
castes. 
Whoever 
has 
the 
power 
to 
repay 
good 
with 
good, 
evil 
with 
evil, 
and 
also 
actually 
repays, 
thus 
being 
grateful 
and 
vengeful, 
is 
called 
good; 
whoever 
is 
powerless 
and 
unable 
to 
repay 
is 
considered 
bad. 
As 
one 
who 
is 
good, 
one 
belongs 
to 
the 
“good,” 
a 
community 
that 
possesses 
communal 
feeling 
because 
all 
individuals 
are 
knit 
together 
by 
the 
sense 
of 
repayment. 
As 
one 
who 
is 
bad, 
one 
belongs 
to 
the 
“bad,” 
a 
group 
of 
subjected, 
impotent 
human 
beings 
who 
have 
no 
communal 
feeling. 
The 
good 
are 
a 
caste, 
the 
bad 
a 
mass 
like 
dust. 
Good 
and 
bad 
are 
for 
a 
time 
the 
same 
as 
noble 
and 
low, 
master 
and 
slave. 
But 
the 
enemy 
is 
not 
considered 
evil, 
he 
can 
repay. 
Trojan 
and 
Greek 
are 
both 
good 
in 
Homer. 
Not 
he 
that 
does 
us 
harm 
but 
he 
that 
is 
contemptible 
is 
considered 
bad. 
In 
the 
community 
of 
the 
good, 
good 
is 
inherited; 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
a 
bad 
person 
should 
grow 
out 
of 
such 
good 
soil. 
If 
one 
of 
the 
good 
nevertheless 
does 
something 
unworthy 
of 
the 
good, 
then 
one 
has 
recourse 
to 
excuses; 
one 
blames 
a 
god, 
for 
example, 
saying 
that 
he 
struck 
the 
good 
man 
with 
delusion 
and 
madness. 


Then, 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
oppressed, 
the 
powerless. 
Here 
all 
other 
human 
beings 
are 
considered 
hostile, 
ruthless, 
exploiting, 
cruel, 
cunning, 
whether 
they 
be 
noble 
or 
low. 
Evil 
is 
the 
characteristic 
word 
for 
man, 
indeed 
for 
every 
living 
being 
believed 
in, 
for 
example 
for 
a 
god; 
human 
or 
divine 
means 
as 
much 
as 
devilish 
or 
evil. 
The 
signs 
of 
graciousness, 
helpfulness, 
pity 
are 
taken 
anxiously 
as 
wiles, 
as 
preludes 
to 
a 
disastrous 
conclusion, 
soporifics 
and 
craft, 
in 
short, 
as 
refined 
malice. 
As 
long 
as 
individuals 
have 
such 
an 
attitude, 
a 
community 
can 
hardly 
come 
into 
being; 
at 
best, 
only 
its 
rudiments: 
hence, 
wherever 
this 
conception 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
rules, 
the 
ruination 
of 
individuals, 
their 
tribes 
and 
races, 
is 
near. 


Our 
current 
morality 
has 
grown 
on 
the 
soil 
of 
the 
ruling 
tribes 
and 
castes.1

Origin 
of 
justice.—Justice 
(fairness)2 
originates 
among 
those 
who 
are 
approximately 
equally 
powerful, 
as 
Thucydides 
(in 
the 
terrible 
conversation 
between 
the 
Athenian 
and 
Melian 
ambassadors) 
comprehended 
correctly: 
where 
there 
is 
no 
clearly 
recognizable 
predominance 
and 
a 
fight 
would 
mean 
inconclusive 
mutual 
damage, 
there 
the 
idea 
originates 
that 
one 
might 
come 
to 
an 
understanding 
and 
negotiate 
one’s 
claims: 
the 
initial 
character 
of 
justice 
is 
the 
character 
of 
a 
trade. 
Each 
satisfies 
the 
other 
inasmuch 
as 
each 
receives 
what 
he 
esteems 
more 
than 
the 
other 
does. 
One 
gives 
another 
what 
he 
wants, 
so 
that 
it 
becomes 
his, 
and 
in 
return 
one 
receives 
what 
one 
wants. 
Thus 
justice 
is 
repayment 
and 
exchange 
on 
the 
assumption 
of 
an 
approximately 
equal 
power 
position; 
revenge 
originally 
belongs 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
justice, 
being 
an 
exchange. 
Gratitude, 
too. 


Justice 
naturally 
derives 
from 
prudent 
concern 
with 
self-preservation; 
that 
means, 
from 
the 
egoism 
of 
the 
consideration: 
“Why 
should 
I 
harm 
myself 
uselessly 
and 
perhaps 
not 
attain 
my 
goal 
anyway?” 


So 
much 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
justice. 
In 
accordance 
with 
their 
intellectual 
habits, 
men 
have 
forgotten 
the 
original 
purpose 
of 
so-called 
just, 
fair 
actions, 
and 
for 
millennia 
children 
have 
been 
taught 
to 
admire 
and 
emulate 
such 
actions. 
Hence 
it 
has 
gradually 
come 
to 
appear 
as 
if 
a 
just 
action 
were 
unegoistic; 
but 
the 
high 
esteem 
for 
it 
depends 
on 
this 
appearance, 
and 
this 
esteem, 
moreover, 
continues 
to 
grow 
all 
the 
time, 
like 
all 
esteem; 
for 
whatever 
is 
highly 
esteemed 
becomes 
the 
object 
of 
striving, 
emulation, 
and 
multiplication, 
coupled 
with 
many 
sacrifices, 
and 
grows 
further 
because 
the 
value 
of 
the 
effort 
and 
zeal 
is 
added 
by 
every 
individual 
to 
the 
value 
of 
the 
thing 
he 
esteems. 


How 
little 
the 
world 
would 
look 
moral 
without 
forgetfulness! 
A 
poet 
might 
say 
that 
God 
made 
forgetfulness 
the 
guard 
he 
placed 
at 
the 
threshold 
of 
human 
dignity.

Mores 
and 
moral.3— 
Being 
moral 
or 
ethical 
means 
obeying 
ancient 
established 
law 
or 
custom. 
Whether 
one 
submits 
to 
it 
with 
difficulty 
or 
gladly, 
that 
is 
immaterial; 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
one 
does 
it. 
“Good” 
is 
what 
one 
calls 
those 
who 
do 
what 
is 
moral 
as 
if 
they 
did 
it 
by 
nature, 
after 
long 
heredity—in 
other 
words, 
easily 
and 
gladly—whatever 
may 
be 
moral 
in 
this 
sense 
(practicing 
revenge, 
for 
example, 
when 
practicing 
revenge 
belongs, 
as 
it 
did 
among 
the 
more 
ancient 
Greeks, 
to 
good 
mores). 
He 
is 
called 
good 
because 
he 
is 
good 
“for 
something”; 
but 
because 
benevolence, 
pity, 
and 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
have 
always 
been 
felt 
to 
be, 
through 
many 
changes 
in 
mores, 
“good 
for 
something” 
and 
useful, 
it 
has 
come 
to 
pass 
that 
now 
the 
benevolent 
and 
helpful 
are 
pre-eminently 
considered 
“good.” 


Being 
evil 
is 
being 
“not 
moral” 
(immoral), 
practicing 
immorality, 
resisting 
tradition, 
however 
reasonable 
or 
stupid 
tradition 
may 
be. 
Harming 
the 
neighbor, 
however, 
has 
been 
felt 
to 
be 
pre-eminently 
harmful 
in 
all 
the 
moral 
laws 
of 
different 
ages, 
until 
now 
the 
word 
“evil” 
is 
associated 
primarily 
with 
the 
deliberate 
harming 
of 
the 
neighbor. 


Not 
“egoistic” 
and 
“unegoistic” 
is 
the 
fundamental 
pair 
of 
contraries 
that 
has 
led 
men 
to 
distinguish 
moral 
and 
immoral, 
good 
and 
evil, 
but 
rather: 
being 
tied 
to 
a 
tradition 
and 
law, 
and 
detachment 
from 
them. 
How 
the 
tradition 
originated 
is 
indifferent; 
in 
any 
case 
it 
was 
without 
any 
regard 
for 
good 
and 
evil 
or 
any 
immanent 
categorical 
imperative, 
but 
above 
all 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
a 
community, 
a 
people: 
every 
superstitious 
custom 
that 
originated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
some 
misinterpreted 
accident 
involves 
a 
tradition 
that 
it 
is 
moral 
to 
follow; 
for 
detaching 
oneself 
from 
it 
is 
dangerous, 
even 
more 
dangerous 
for 
the 
community 
than 
for 
the 
individual 
(because 
the 
deity 
punishes 
the 
community—and 
the 
individual 
only 
indirectly—for 
the 
sacrilege 
and 
the 
violation 
of 
divine 
privileges). 
Now 
every 
tradition 
becomes 
ever 
more 
venerable 
the 
more 
remote 
its 
origins 
are 
and 
the 
more 
they 
have 
been 
forgotten; 
the 
veneration 
shown 
it 
is 
accumulated, 
generation 
upon 
generation; 
finally, 
the 
tradition 
becomes 
holy 
and 
inspires 
reverence; 
and 
thus 
the 
morality 
of 
pious 
regard 
for 
the 
old4 
is 
certainly 
a 
much 
more 



ancient 
morality 
than 
that 
which 
demands 
unegoistic 
actions. 



136 


On 
Christian 
asceticism 
and 
holiness.—Strongly 
as 
individual 
thinkers 
have 
endeavored 
to 
present 
the 
rare 
phenomena 
of 
morality 
that 
are 
usually 
called 
asceticism 
and 
holiness 
as 
if 
they 
were 
marvels 
that 
it 
would 
almost 
be 
sacrilege 
and 
desecration 
to 
illuminate 
by 
raising 
the 
torch 
of 
rational 
explanation 
up 
to 
their 
face—the 
temptation 
to 
commit 
this 
sacrilege 
is 
just 
as 
strong. 
A 
powerful 
impulse 
of 
nature 
has 
led 
men 
in 
all 
ages 
to 
protest 
against 
these 
phenomena 
as 
such; 
science, 
insofar 
as 
it 
is, 
as 
mentioned, 
an 
imitation 
of 
nature, 
at 
least 
takes 
the 
liberty 
to 
object 
to 
their 
alleged 
inexplicability 
and 
even 
unapproachability. 
To 
be 
sure, 
so 
far 
it 
has 
not 
succeeded: 
these 
phenomena 
are 
still 
unexplained, 
much 
to 
the 
delight 
of 
the 
said 
admirers 
of 
moral 
marvels. 
For, 
to 
speak 
generally: 
the 
unexplained 
should 
by 
all 
means 
be 
unexplainable, 
the 
unexplainable 
by 
all 
means 
unnatural, 
supernatural, 
miraculous—thus 
goes 
the 
demand 
in 
the 
souls 
of 
all 
the 
religious 
and 
metaphysicians 
(of 
artists, 
too, 
if 
they 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
thinkers); 
while 
the 
scientific 
person 
sees 
in 
this 
demand 
the 
“evil 
principle.” 


The 
general 
first 
probability 
one 
encounters 
as 
one 
contemplates 
holiness 
and 
asceticism 
is 
this: 
their 
nature 
is 
complicated; 
for 
almost 
everywhere, 
in 
the 
physical 
world 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
moral 
world, 
one 
has 
succeeded 
in 
reducing 
the 
allegedly 
miraculous 
to 
the 
complicated 
which 
depends 
on 
many 
conditions. 
Let 
us 
dare 
then 
to 
begin 
by 
isolating 
single 
impulses 
in 
the 
souls 
of 
holy 
men 
and 
ascetics, 
and 
to 
conclude 
by 
thinking 
of 
them 
as 
grown 
together. 



137 


There 
is 
a 
defiance 
of 
oneself 
among 
whose 
most 
sublimated 
expressions 
some 
forms 
of 
asceticism 
belong. 
For 
certain 
human 
beings 
have 
such 
a 
great 
need 
to 
exercise 
their 
force 
and 
lust 
to 
rule 
that, 
lacking 
other 
objects, 
or 
because 
they 
have 
always 
failed 
elsewhere, 
they 
finally 
have 
recourse 
to 
tyrannizing 
certain 
parts 
of 
their 
own 
nature, 
as 
it 
were 
sections 
or 
stages 
of 
themselves. 


Thus 
some 
thinkers 
profess 
views 
that 
evidently 
do 
not 
serve 
to 
increase 
or 
improve 
their 
reputations; 
some 
practically 
conjure 
up 
the 
disrespect 
of 
others 
for 
them, 
although 
it 
would 
be 
easy 
for 
them 
to 
remain 
highly 
respected, 
simply 
by 
keeping 
still. 
Others 
recant 
former 
opinions 
and 
are 
not 
afraid 
of 
henceforth 
being 
called 
inconsistent: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
exert 
themselves 
to 
that 
end 
and 
behave 
like 
exuberant 
riders 
who 
like 
their 
horse 
best 
when 
it 
has 
gone 
wild, 
is 
covered 
with 
sweat, 
and 
shying. 


Thus 
man 
ascends 
the 
highest 
mountains 
on 
dangerous 
paths, 
to 
laugh 
scornfully 
at 
his 
anxiety 
and 
his 
trembling 
knees; 
thus 
the 
philosopher 
professes 
views 
of 
asceticism, 
humility, 
and 
sanctity 
in 
whose 
splendor 
his 
own 
image 
is 
made 
exceedingly 
ugly. 
This 
breaking 
of 
oneself, 
this 
mockery 
of 
one’s 
own 
nature, 
this 
spernere 
se 
sperni5 
of 
which 
religions 
have 
made 
so 
much, 
is 
really 
a 
very 
high 
degree 
of 
vanity. 
The 
whole 
morality 
of 
the 
Sermon 
on 
the 
Mount 
belongs 
here: 
man 
experiences 
a 
veritable 
voluptuousness 
in 
violating 
himself 
by 
means 
of 
exaggerated 
demands 
and 
in 
then 
deifying 
this 
tyrannically 
demanding 
force 
in 
his 
soul. 


In 
every 
ascetic 
morality 
man 
adores 
part 
of 
himself 
as 
God 
and 
to 
that 
end 
needs 
to 
diabolicize 
the 
rest. 



142 


To 
sum 
up 
what 
has 
been 
said 
here: 
that 
state 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
the 
holy 
man 
or 
the 
man 
who 
is 
becoming 
holy 
enjoys 
is 
composed 
of 
elements 
which 
all 
of 
us 
know 
quite 
well; 
they 
merely 
take 
on 
a 
different 
coloring 
when 
they 
are 
influenced 
by 
nonreligious 
ideas, 
and 
then 
they 
are 
usually 
reproached 
by 
men 
just 
as 
much 
as 
they 
can 
count—or 
at 
least 
could 
count 
in 
former 
times 
—on 
admiration, 
even 
worship, 
when 
associated 
with 
religion 
and 
the 
ultimate 
meaning 
of 
existence. 


Sometimes 
the 
holy 
man 
practices 
that 
defiance 
against 
himself 
which 
is 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
lust 
to 
rule 
at 
any 
price 
and 
which 
gives 
even 
the 
loneliest 
the 
feeling 
of 
power; 
sometimes 
his 
swollen 
feeling 
changes 
from 
the 
craving 
to 
let 
his 
passions 
run 
their 
course 
into 
the 
craving 
to 
make 
them 
collapse 
like 
wild 
horses 
under 
the 
powerful 
pressure 
of 
a 
proud 
soul; 
sometimes 
he 
wants 
the 
complete 
cessation 
of 
all 
feelings 
that 
disturb, 
torment, 
provoke—a 
wakeful 
sleep, 
an 
enduring 
rest 
in 
the 
lap 
of 
a 
dumb, 
animal-or 
plant-like 
indolence; 
sometimes 
he 
seeks 
a 
fight 
and 
inflames 
it 
within 
himself 
because 
boredom 
fixes 
him 
with 
a 
yawning 
countenance: 
he 
scourges 
his 
self-deification 
with 
self-contempt 
and 
cruelty, 
he 
delights 
in 
the 
wild 
rebellion 
of 
his 
desires, 
in 
the 
sharp 
pain 
of 
sin, 
even 
in 
the 
idea 
that 
he 
is 
lost; 
he 
knows 
how 
to 
lay 
a 
snare 
for 
his 
affects, 
that 
of 
the 
most 
extreme 
lust 
to 
rule, 
for 
example, 
so 
that 
it 
changes 
into 
the 
most 
extreme 
humiliation 
and 
this 
contrast 
completely 
unbalances 
his 
hounded 
soul; 
and 
finally: 
if 
he 
should 
crave 
visions 
or 
conversation 
with 
the 
dead 
or 
with 
divine 
beings, 
this 
is 
at 
bottom 
a 
rare 
kind 
of 
voluptuousness 
that 
he 
desires, 
but 
perhaps 
that 
voluptuousness 
in 
which 
all 
the 
others 
are 
tied 
up 
into 
one 
knot. 
Novalis,6 
one 
of 
the 
authorities 
on 
questions 
of 
holiness, 
both 
by 
experience 
and 
by 
instinct, 
once 
expressed 
the 
whole 
secret 
with 
a 
naïve 
joy: 
“It 
is 
marvelous 
enough 
that 
the 
association 
of 
voluptuousness, 
religion, 
and 
cruelty 
has 
not 
long 
attracted 
the 
attention 
of 
men 
to 
their 
close 
kinship 
and 
common 
tendency.”

what 
the 
holy 
man 
is 
but 
what 
he 
signifies 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
those 
who 
are 
not 
holy 
gives 
him 
his 
world-historical 
value. 
It 
was 
because 
one 
was 
wrong 
about 
him, 
because 
one 
misinterpreted 
the 
states 
of 
his 
soul 
and 
drew 
as 
sharp 
a 
line 
as 
possible 
between 
oneself 
and 
him, 
as 
if 
he 
were 
something 
utterly 
incomparable 
and 
strangely 
superhuman—that 
he 
gained 
that 
extraordinary 
power 
with 
which 
he 
could 
dominate 
the 
imagination 
of 
whole 
peoples 
and 
ages. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
himself; 
he 
understood 
the 
writing 
of 
his 
moods, 
inclinations, 
and 
actions 
according 
to 
an 
art 
of 
interpretation 
which 
was 
just 
as 
extravagant 
and 
artificial 
as 
the 
pneumatic 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Bible. 
What 
was 
eccentric 
and 
sick 
in 
his 
nature, 
with 
its 
fusion 
of 
spiritual 
poverty, 
faulty 
knowledge, 
spoilt 
health, 
and 
overexcited 
nerves 
remained 
concealed 
from 
his 
own 
eyes 
and 
from 
the 
eyes 
of 
those 
who 
looked 
at 
him. 
He 
was 
not 
an 
especially 
good 
person, 
even 
less 
an 
especially 
wise 
person; 
but 
he 
signified 
something 
that 
exceeded 
all 
human 
measure 
of 
goodness 
and 
wisdom. 
The 
faith 
in 
him 
supported 
the 
faith 
in 
the 
divine 
and 
miraculous, 
in 
a 
religious 
meaning 
of 
all 
existence, 
in 
an 
impending 
final 
day 
of 
judgment. 
In 
the 
evening 
splendor 
of 
the 
world-end’s 
sunset 
that 
illuminated 
the 
Christian 
peoples, 
the 
shadowy 
figure 
of 
the 
holy 
man 
grew 
into 
something 
enormous—indeed, 
to 
such 
a 
height 
that 
even 
in 
our 
time, 
which 
no 
longer 
believes 
in 
God, 
there 
are 
still 
thinkers 
who 
believe 
in 
the 
holy 
man.7 



144 


It 
scarcely 
needs 
saying 
that 
this 
sketch 
of 
the 
holy 
man, 
being 
drawn 
after 
the 
average 
of 
the 
whole 
species, 
can 
be 
countered 
with 
many 
sketches 
that 
tend 
to 
produce 
a 
more 
agreeable 
feeling. 
Single 
exceptions 
stand 
out 
from 
the 
species, 
whether 
by 
virtue 
of 
great 
mildness 
and 
humanitarianism 
or 
by 
the 
magic 
of 
unusual 
energy; 
others 
are 
attractive 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
because 
certain 
delusions 
inundate 
their 
whole 
nature 
with 
light—as 
is 
the 
case, 
for 
example, 
with 
the 
celebrated 
founder 
of 
Christianity 
who 
considered 
himself 
the 
inborn 
son 
of 
God 
and 
therefore 
felt 
he 
was 
without 
sin; 
thus, 
by 
virtue 
of 
an 
illusion—which 
should 
not 
be 
judged 
too 
harshly, 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
antiquity 
was 
full 
of 
sons 
of 
gods—he 
attained 
the 
same 
goal, 
the 
feeling 
of 
complete 
freedom 
from 
sin, 
complete 
lack 
of 
responsibility, 
which 
is 
now 
available 
to 
everybody 
by 
means 
of 
science! 


I 
have 
also 
ignored 
the 
holy 
men 
of 
India 
who 
occupy 
an 
intermediate 
stage 
between 
the 
Christian 
holy 
man 
and 
the 
Greek 
philosopher, 
and 
thus 
do 
not 
represent 
a 
pure 
type: 
knowledge, 
science—insofar 
as 
science 
existed— 
raising 
oneself 
above 
other 
men 
through 
the 
logical 
discipline 
and 
training 
of 
thought, 
were 
just 
as 
much 
demanded 
among 
the 
Buddhists, 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
holiness, 
as 
the 
same 
qualities 
were 
repudiated 
and 
pronounced 
heretical 
in 
the 
Christian 
world 
where 
they 
were 
held 
to 
be 
signs 
of 
unholiness.

Opinions

Maxims

Mores 
and 
their 
victim.— 
The 
origin 
of 
mores 
may 
be 
found 
in 
two 
thoughts: 
“society 
is 
worth 
more 
than 
the 
individual,” 
and 
“enduring 
advantage 
is 
to 
be 
preferred 
to 
ephemeral 
advantage”— 
from 
which 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
enduring 
advantage 
of 
society 
must 
be 
given 
precedence, 
unconditionally, 
over 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
individual, 
especially 
over 
his 
momentary 
well-being 
but 
also 
over 
his 
enduring 
advantage 
and 
even 
his 
continued 
existence. 
Whether 
the 
individual 
suffers 
from 
an 
institution 
that 
is 
good 
for 
the 
whole, 
whether 
it 
causes 
him 
to 
atrophy 
or 
perish—mores 
must 
be 
preserved, 
sacrifices 
must 
be 
made. 
But 
such 
an 
attitude 
originates 
only 
in 
those 
who 
are 
not 
its 
victims 
—for 
they 
claim 
in 
their 
behalf 
that 
the 
individual 
may 
be 
worth 
more 
than 
many, 
also 
that 
present 
enjoyment, 
the 
moment 
in 
paradise, 
may 
have 
to 
be 
valued 
higher 
than 
a 
pallid 
continuation 
of 
painless 
or 
complacent 
states. 
The 
philosophy 
of 
the 
sacrificial 
animal, 
however, 
is 
always 
sounded 
too 
late; 
and 
so 
we 
retain 
mores 
and 
morality1 
—which 
is 
no 
more 
than 
the 
feeling 
for 
the 
whole 
quintessence 
of 
mores 
under 
which 
one 
lives 
and 
has 
been 
brought 
up 
—brought 
up 
not 
as 
an 
individual 
but 
as 
a 
member 
of 
a 
whole, 
as 
a 
digit 
of 
a 
majority.— 
Thus 
it 
happens 
constantly 
that 
an 
individual 
brings 
to 
bear 
upon 
himself, 
by 
means 
of 
his 
morality, 
the 
tyranny 
of 
the 
majority.2

Readers’ 
bad 
manners.— 
A 
reader 
is 
doubly 
guilty 
of 
bad 
manners 
against 
the 
author 
when 
he 
praises 
his 
second 
book 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
first 
(or 
vice 
versa) 
and 
then 
asks 
the 
author 
to 
be 
grateful 
for 
that. 



137 


The 
worst 
readers.— 
The 
worst 
readers 
are 
those 
who 
proceed 
like 
plundering 
soldiers: 
they 
pick 
up 
a 
few 
things 
they 
can 
use, 
soil 
and 
confuse 
the 
rest, 
and 
blaspheme 
the 
whole. 



145 


Value 
of 
honest 
books.— 
Honest 
books 
make 
the 
reader 
honest, 
at 
least 
by 
luring 
into 
the 
open 
his 
hatred 
and 
aversion 
which 
his 
sly 
prudence 
otherwise 
knows 
how 
to 
conceal 
best. 
But 
against 
a 
book 
one 
lets 
oneself 
go, 
even 
if 
one 
is 
very 
reserved 
toward 
people. 



157 


Sharpest 
criticism.— 
One 
criticizes 
a 
person, 
a 
book, 
most 
sharply 
when 
one 
pictures 
their 
ideal. 



168 


Praise 
of 
aphorisms.— 
A 
good 
aphorism 
is 
too 
hard 
for 
the 
tooth 
of 
time 
and 
is 
not 
consumed 
by 
all 
millennia, 
although 
it 
serves 
every 
time 
for 
nourishment: 
thus 
it 
is 
the 
great 
paradox 
of 
literature, 
the 
intransitory 
amid 
the 
changing, 
the 
food 
that 
always 
remains 
esteemed, 
like 
salt, 
and 
never 
loses 
its 
savor, 
as 
even 
that 
does. 



200 


Original.— 
Not 
that 
one 
is 
the 
first 
to 
see 
something 
new, 
but 
that 
one 
sees 
as 
new 
what 
is 
old, 
long 
familiar, 
seen 
and 
overlooked 
by 
everybody, 
is 
what 
distinguishes 
truly 
original 
minds. 
The 
first 
discoverer 
is 
ordinarily 
that 
wholly 
common 
creature, 
devoid 
of 
spirit 
and 
addicted 
to 
fantasy—accident. 



201 


Philosophers’ 
error.— 
The 
philosopher 
supposes 
that 
the 
value 
of 
his 
philosophy 
lies 
in 
the 
whole, 
in 
the 
structure; 
but 
posterity 
finds 
its 
value 
in 
the 
stone 
which 
he 
used 
for 
building, 
and 
which 
is 
used 
many 
more 
times 
after 
that 
for 
building—better. 
Thus 
it 
finds 
the 
value 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
structure 
can 
be 
destroyed 
and 
nevertheless 
retains 
value 
as 
building 
material. 



206 


Why 
scholars 
are 
nobler3 
than 
artists.— 
Science 
requires 
nobler 
natures 
than 
poetry 
does: 
they 
have 
to 
be 
simpler, 
less 
ambitious, 
more 
abstinent, 
quieter, 
not 
so 
concerned 
about 
posthumous 
fame, 
and 
forget 
themselves 
over 
matters 
that 
rarely 
seem 
worthy 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
many 
of 
such 
a 
sacrifice 
of 
one’s 
personality. 
To 
this 
must 
be 
added 
another 
loss 
of 
which 
they 
are 
conscious: 
the 
type 
of 
their 
work, 
the 
continual 
demand 
for 
the 
greatest 
sobriety, 
weakens 
their 
will; 
the 
fire 
is 
not 
kept 
as 
strong 
as 
on 
the 
hearth 
of 
poetic 
natures—and 
therefore 
they 
often 
lose 
their 
highest 
strength 
and 
bloom 
at 
an 
earlier 
age 
than 
those 
men 
do—and, 
as 
mentioned, 
they 
realize 
this 
danger. 
In 
any 
case 
they 
appear 
less 
gifted 
because 
they 
shine 
less, 
and 
they 
will 
be 
considered 
inferior 
to 
what 
they 
are. 



251 


In 
parting.— 
Not 
how 
one 
soul 
comes 
close 
to 
another 
but 
how 
it 
moves 
away 
shows 
me 
their 
kinship 
and 
how 
much 
they 
belong 
together. 



298 


Virtue 
has 
not 
been 
invented 
by 
the 
Germans.— 
Goethe’s 
nobility4 
and 
lack 
of 
envy, 
Beethoven’s 
noble5 
hermit’s 
resignation, 
Mozart’s 
charm 
and 
grace 
of 
the 
heart, 
Handel’s 
unbendable 
manliness 
and 
freedom 
under 
the 
law, 
Bach’s 
confident 
and 
transfigured 
inner 
life 
that 
does 
not 
even 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
renounce 
splendor 
and 
success—are 
these 
in 
any 
way 
German 
qualities?— 
But 
if 
not, 
it 
at 
least 
shows 
for 
what 
Germans 
should 
strive 
and 
what 
they 
can 
attain. 



309 


Siding 
against 
oneself.— 
Our 
adherents 
never 
forgive 
us 
if 
we 
take 
sides 
against 
ourselves: 
for 
in 
their 
eyes 
this 
means 
not 
only 
rejecting 
their 
love 
but 
also 
exposing 
their 
intelligence. 



325 


Opinions.— 
Most 
people 
are 
nothing 
and 
are 
considered 
nothing 
until 
they 
have 
dressed 
themselves 
up 
in 
general 
convictions 
and 
public 
opinions—in 
accordance 
with 
the 
tailor 
philosophy: 
clothes 
make 
people. 
Of 
the 
exceptional 
person, 
however, 
it 
must 
be 
said: 
only 
he 
that 
wears 
it 
makes 
the 
costume;6 
here 
opinions 
cease 
to 
be 
public 
and 
become 
something 
other 
than 
masks, 
finery, 
and 
disguises.

Loving 
the 
master.— 
Not 
as 
apprentices 
do, 
loves 
a 
master 
a 
master.7 



346 


Being 
misunderstood.— 
When 
one 
is 
misunderstood 
as 
a 
whole, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
remove 
completely 
a 
single 
misunderstanding. 
One 
has 
to 
realize 
this 
lest 
one 
waste 
superfluous 
energy 
on 
one’s 
defense.

How 
duty 
acquires 
splendor.— 
The 
means 
for 
changing 
your 
iron 
duty 
to 
gold 
in 
everyone’s 
eyes 
is 
this: 
always 
keep 
a 
little 
more 
than 
you 
promise. 



405 


Prayer 
to 
men.— 
“Forgive 
us 
our 
virtues”—thus 
one 
should 
pray 
to 
men. 



408 


The 
journey 
to 
Hades.— 
I, 
too, 
have 
been 
in 
the 
underworld, 
like 
Odysseus, 
and 
shall 
be 
there 
often 
yet; 
and 
not 
only 
rams 
have 
I 
sacrificed 
to 
be 
able 
to 
speak 
with 
a 
few 
of 
the 
dead, 
but 
I 
have 
not 
spared 
my 
own 
blood. 
Four 
pairs 
it 
was 
that 
did 
not 
deny 
themselves 
to 
my 
sacrifice: 
Epicurus 
and 
Montaigne, 
Goethe 
and 
Spinoza, 
Plato 
and 
Rousseau, 
Pascal 
and 
Schopenhauer. 
With 
these 
I 
must 
come 
to 
terms 
when 
I 
have 
long 
wandered 
alone; 
they 
may 
call 
me 
right 
and 
wrong; 
to 
them 
will 
I 
listen 
when 
in 
the 
process 
they 
call 
each 
other 
right 
and 
wrong. 
Whatsoever 
I 
say, 
resolve, 
or 
think 
up 
for 
myself 
and 
others—on 
these 
eight 
I 
fix 
my 
eyes 
and 
see 
their 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
me. 


May 
the 
living 
forgive 
me 
that 
occasionally 
they 
appear 
to 
me 
as 
shades, 
so 
pale 
and 
somber, 
so 
restless 
and, 
alas, 
so 
lusting 
for 
life—while 
those 
men 
then 
seem 
so 
alive 
to 
me 
as 
if 
now, 
after 
death, 
they 
could 
never 
again 
grow 
weary 
of 
life. 
But 
eternal 
aliveness 
is 
what 
counts: 
what 
matters 
“eternal 
life” 
or 
any 
life!8

Elements 
of 
revenge.— 
The 
word 
“revenge” 
is 
said 
so 
quickly, 
it 
almost 
seems 
as 
if 
it 
could 
not 
contain 
more 
than 
one 
root 
concept 
and 
feeling. 
And 
so 
people 
are 
still 
trying 
to 
find 
this 
root—just 
as 
our 
economists 
still 
have 
not 
got 
tired 
of 
smelling 
such 
a 
unity 
in 
the 
word 
“value” 
and 
of 
looking 
for 
the 
original 
root 
concept 
of 
value. 
As 
if 
all 
words 
were 
not 
pockets 
into 
which 
now 
this 
and 
now 
that 
has 
been 
put, 
and 
now 
many 
things 
at 
once!1 
Thus 
“revenge,” 
too, 
is 
now 
this 
and 
now 
that, 
and 
now 
something 
very 
composite. 


Let 
us 
distinguish, 
first, 
that 
return 
blow 
of 
resistance 
which 
is 
almost 
an 
involuntary 
reflex, 
executed 
even 
against 
lifeless 
objects 
that 
have 
harmed 
us 
(such 
as 
moving 
machines): 
the 
sense 
of 
this 
countermove 
is 
to 
stop 
the 
harm 
by 
bringing 
the 
machine 
to 
a 
halt. 
Occasionally, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
counterblow 
must 
be 
so 
strong 
to 
succeed 
in 
this 
that 
it 
smashes 
the 
machine; 
but 
where 
that 
is 
too 
strong 
to 
be 
destructible 
immediately 
by 
an 
individual, 
he 
will 
nevertheless 
strike 
as 
hard 
as 
he 
can—making, 
as 
it 
were, 
an 
all-outattempt. 
One 
behaves 
the 
same 
way 
against 
persons 
who 
harm 
one, 
as 
long 
as 
one 
feels 
the 
harm 
immediately: 
if 
you 
want 
to 
call 
this 
action 
an 
act 
of 
revenge, 
all 
right; 
but 
consider 
that 
it 
is 
only 
self-preservation 
that 
has 
here 
put 
its 
rational 
machinery 
into 
motion, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
one 
does 
not 
think 
at 
all 
of 
the 
harming 
person 
in 
such 
a 
case 
but 
only 
of 
oneself: 
we 
act 
that 
way 
without 
any 
wish 
to 
do 
harm 
in 
return, 
merely 
in 
order 
to 
get 
away 
with 
life 
and 
limb. 


Time 
is 
needed—when 
instead 
of 
concentrating 
on 
oneself 
one 
begins 
to 
think 
about 
one’s 
opponent, 
asking 
oneself 
how 
one 
can 
hurt 
him 
the 
most. 
This 
happens 
in 
the 
second 
type 
of 
revenge: 
reflection 
on 
the 
other 
person’s 
vulnerability 
and 
capacity 
for 
suffering 
is 
its 
presupposition; 
one 
wants 
to 
hurt. 
Protecting 
oneself 
against 
further 
harm, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
so 
little 
a 
consideration 
for 
the 
seeker 
of 
such 
vengeance 
that 
he 
almost 
regularly 
brings 
about 
further 
harm 
to 
himself 
and 
quite 
often 
anticipates 
this 
in 
cold 
blood. 
In 
the 
first 
type 
of 
revenge 
it 
was 
fear 
of 
a 
second 
blow 
that 
made 
the 
counterblow 
as 
strong 
as 
possible; 
here 
we 
find 
almost 
total 
indifference 
to 



what 
the 
opponent 
will 
do 
yet; 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
counterblow 
is 
determined 
solely 
by 
what 
he 
has 
done 
to 
us. 
But 
what 
has 
he 
done? 
And 
what 
use 
is 
it 
to 
us 
if 
he 
now 
suffers 
after 
we 
have 
suffered 
on 
his 
account? 
What 
matters 
is 
a 
restoration, 
while 
the 
act 
of 
revenge 
of 
the 
first 
type 
serves 
only 
self-
preservation. 
Perhaps 
we 
have 
lost 
through 
our 
opponent 
possessions, 
rank, 
friends, 
children: 
such 
losses 
are 
not 
brought 
back 
by 
revenge; 
the 
restoration 
concerns 
solely 
a 
loss 
incidental 
to 
all 
these 
losses. 
The 
revenge 
of 
restoration 
does 
not 
protect 
against 
further 
harm; 
it 
does 
not 
make 
good 
the 
harm 
suffered—except 
in 
one 
case. 
If 
our 
honor 
has 
suffered 
from 
our 
opponent, 
then 
revenge 
can 
restore 
it. 
But 
this 
has 
suffered 
damage 
in 
every 
instance 
in 
which 
suffering 
has 
been 
inflicted 
on 
us 
deliberately; 
for 
our 
opponent 
thus 
demonstrated 
that 
he 
did 
not 
fear 
us. 
By 
revenge 
we 
demonstrate 
that 
we 
do 
not 
fear 
him 
either: 
this 
constitutes 
the 
equalization, 
the 
restoration. 
(The 
intent 
of 
showing 
one’s 
utter 
lack 
of 
fear 
goes 
so 
far 
in 
some 
persons 
that 
the 
danger 
their 
revenge 
involves 
for 
them—loss 
of 
health 
or 
life 
or 
other 
damage—is 
for 
them 
an 
indispensable 
condition 
of 
all 
revenge. 
Therefore 
they 
choose 
the 
means 
of 
a 
duel 
although 
the 
courts 
offer 
them 
help 
in 
obtaining 
satisfaction 
for 
the 
insult: 
but 
they 
do 
not 
accept 
an 
undangerous 
restoration 
of 
their 
honor 
as 
sufficient, 
because 
it 
cannot 
demonstrate 
their 
lack 
of 
fear.) 


In 
the 
first 
type 
of 
revenge 
it 
is 
fear 
that 
strikes 
the 
counterblow; 
here, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
the 
absence 
of 
fear 
that, 
as 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
show, 
wants 
to 
prove 
itself 
by 
means 
of 
the 
counterblow. 


Nothing 
therefore 
seems 
more 
different 
than 
the 
inner 
motivation 
of 
the 
two 
ways 
of 
action 
that 
are 
called 
by 
one 
name, 
“revenge.” 
Nevertheless 
it 
happens 
quite 
frequently 
that 
the 
person 
seeking 
revenge 
is 
unclear 
about 
what 
really 
induced 
him 
to 
act: 
perhaps 
he 
delivered 
the 
counterblow 
from 
fear 
and 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
himself, 
but 
later, 
when 
he 
has 
time 
to 
think 
about 
the 
point 
of 
his 
injured 
honor, 
he 
convinces 
himself 
that 
he 
avenged 
himself 
for 
his 
honor’s 
sake—after 
all, 
this 
motive 
is 
nobler 
than 
the 
other 
one. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
also 
important 
whether 
he 
believes 
his 
honor 
to 
have 
been 
injured 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
others 
(the 
world) 
or 
only 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
opponent 
who 
insulted 
him: 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
he 
will 
prefer 
secret 
revenge, 
in 
the 
former 
public 
revenge. 
Depending 
on 
whether 
he 
projects 
himself 
strongly 
or 
weakly 
into 
the 
soul 
of 
his 
opponent 
and 
the 
spectators, 
his 
revenge 
will 
be 
more 
embittered 
or 
tamer; 
if 
he 
lacks 
this 
type 
of 
imagination 
entirely, 
he 
will 
not 
think 
of 
revenge 
at 
all, 
for 
in 
that 
case 
the 
feeling 
for 



“honor” 
is 
not 
present 
in 
him 
and 
hence 
cannot 
be 
injured. 
Just 
so, 
he 
will 
not 
think 
of 
revenge 
if 
he 
despises 
the 
doer 
and 
the 
spectators 
of 
the 
deed— 
because 
they, 
being 
despised, 
cannot 
accord 
him 
any 
honor 
and 
hence 
also 
cannot 
take 
it 
away. 
Finally, 
he 
will 
forgo 
revenge 
in 
the 
not 
unusual 
case 
in 
which 
he 
loves 
the 
doer: 
to 
be 
sure, 
he 
thus 
loses 
honor 
in 
his 
opponent’s 
eyes 
and 
perhaps 
thus 
becomes 
less 
worthy 
of 
being 
loved 
in 
return. 
But 
even 
forgoing 
all 
such 
counterlove 
is 
a 
sacrifice 
that 
love 
is 
prepared 
to 
make 
if 
only 
it 
does 
not 
have 
to 
hurt 
the 
beloved 
being: 
that 
would 
mean 
hurting 
oneself 
more 
than 
this 
sacrifice 
hurts. 


Thus: 
everybody 
will 
revenge 
himself 
unless 
he 
is 
without 
honor 
or 
full 
of 
contempt 
or 
full 
of 
love 
for 
the 
person 
who 
has 
harmed 
and 
insulted 
him. 
Even 
when 
he 
has 
recourse 
to 
the 
courts 
he 
wants 
revenge 
as 
a 
private 
person 
—but 
besides, 
being 
a 
member 
of 
society 
who 
thinks 
further 
and 
considers 
the 
future, 
he 
also 
wants 
society’s 
revenge 
on 
one 
who 
does 
not 
honor 
it. 
Thus 
judicial 
punishment 
restores 
both 
private 
honor 
and 
the 
honor 
of 
society 
—which 
means, 
punishment 
is 
revenge. 


Indubitably, 
it 
also 
contains 
that 
other 
element 
of 
revenge 
which 
we 
described 
first, 
insofar 
as 
society 
uses 
punishment 
for 
its 
self-preservation 
and 
deals 
a 
counterblow 
in 
self-defense. 
Punishment 
desires 
to 
prevent 
further 
damage; 
it 
desires 
to 
deter. 
Thus 
both 
of 
these 
so 
different 
elements 
of 
revenge 
are 
actually 
tied 
together 
in 
punishment, 
and 
perhaps 
this 
is 
the 
main 
support 
of 
that 
above-mentioned 
conceptual 
confusion 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
the 
individual 
who 
revenges 
himself 
usually 
does 
not 
know 
what 
he 
really 
wants.

Dreams.— 
On 
the 
rare 
occasions 
when 
our 
dreams 
succeed 
and 
achieve 
perfection—most 
dreams 
are 
bungled—they 
are 
symbolic 
chains 
of 
scenes 
and 
images 
in 
place 
of 
a 
narrative 
poetic 
language; 
they 
circumscribe 
our 
experiences 
or 
expectations 
or 
situations 
with 
such 
poetic 
boldness 
and 
decisiveness 
that 
in 
the 
morning 
we 
are 
always 
amazed 
at 
ourselves 
when 
we 
remember 
our 
dreams. 
We 
use 
up 
too 
much 
artistry 
in 
our 
dreams—and 
therefore 
often 
are 
impoverished 
during 
the 
day.

Tourists.— 
They 
climb 
mountains 
like 
animals, 
stupid 
and 
sweating; 
one 
has 
forgotten 
to 
tell 
them 
that 
there 
are 
beautiful 
views 
on 
the 
way 
up. 



203 


Too 
much 
and 
too 
little.— 
All 
men 
now 
live 
through 
too 
much 
and 
think 
through 
too 
little: 
they 
suffer 
at 
the 
same 
time 
from 
extreme 
hunger 
and 
from 
colic, 
and 
therefore 
become 
thinner 
and 
thinner, 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
they 
eat.— 
Whoever 
says 
now, 
“I 
have 
not 
lived 
through 
anything”—is 
an 
ass.

End 
and 
goal.— 
Not 
every 
end 
is 
the 
goal. 
The 
end 
of 
a 
melody 
is 
not 
its 
goal; 
and 
yet: 
as 
long 
as 
the 
melody 
has 
not 
reached 
its 
end, 
it 
also 
hasn’t 
reached 
its 
goal. 
A 
parable.

How 
to 
have 
all 
men 
against 
you.— 
If 
anyone 
dared 
to 
say 
now, 
“Whoever 
is 
not 
for 
me, 
is 
against 
me,”2 
he 
would 
immediately 
have 
all 
men 
against 
him.— 
This 
does 
our 
time 
honor. 



249 


Positive 
and 
negative.— 
This 
thinker 
needs 
nobody 
to 
refute 
him: 
for 
that 
he 
suffices 
himself. 



263 


Way 
to 
equality.— 
A 
few 
hours 
of 
mountain 
climbing 
turn 
a 
villain 
and 
a 
saint 
into 
two 
rather 
equal 
creatures. 
Exhaustion 
is 
the 
shortest 
way 
to 
equality 
and 
fraternity—and 
liberty 
is 
added 
eventually 
by 
sleep. 



297 


Not 
to 
wish 
to 
see 
too 
soon.— 
As 
long 
as 
one 
lives 
through 
an 
experience, 
one 
must 
surrender 
to 
the 
experience 
and 
shut 
one’s 
eyes 
instead 
of 
becoming 
an 
observer 
immediately. 
For 
that 
would 
disturb 
the 
good 
digestion 
of 
the 
experience: 
instead 
of 
wisdom 
one 
would 
acquire 
indigestion. 



298 


From 
the 
practice 
of 
wise 
men.— 
To 
become 
wise, 
one 
must 
wish 
to 
have 
certain 
experiences 
and 
run, 
as 
it 
were, 
into 
their 
gaping 
jaws. 
This, 
of 
course, 
is 
very 
dangerous; 
many 
a 
wise 
guy 
has 
been 
swallowed. 



301 


A 
testimony 
of 
love.— 
Somebody 
said: 
“About 
two 
persons 
I 
have 
never 
reflected 
very 
thoroughly: 
that 
is 
the 
testimony 
of 
my 
love 
for 
them.”3 



302 


How 
one 
tries 
to 
improve 
bad 
arguments.— 
Some 
people 
throw 
a 
bit 
of 
their 
personality 
after 
their 
bad 
arguments, 
as 
if 
that 
might 
straighten 
their 
paths 
and 
turn 
them 
into 
right 
and 
good 
arguments—just 
as 
a 
man 
in 
a 
bowling 
alley, 
after 
he 
has 
let 
go 
of 
the 
ball, 
still 
tries 
to 
direct 
it 
with 
gestures.

When 
taking 
leave 
is 
needed.— 
From 
what 
you 
would 
know 
and 
measure, 
you 
must 
take 
leave, 
at 
least 
for 
a 
time. 
Only 
after 
having 
left 
town, 
you 
see 
how 
high 
its 
towers 
rise 
above 
the 
houses. 



317 


Opinions 
and 
fish.— 
Possessing 
opinions 
is 
like 
possessing 
fish, 
assuming 
one 
has 
a 
fish 
pond. 
One 
has 
to 
go 
fishing 
and 
needs 
some 
luck—then 
one 
has 
one’s 
own 
fish, 
one’s 
own 
opinions. 
I 
am 
speaking 
of 
live 
opinions, 
of 
live 
fish. 
Others 
are 
satisfied 
if 
they 
own 
a 
cabinet 
of 
fossils—and 
in 
their 
heads, 
“convictions.”4

Death.— 
The 
certain 
prospect 
of 
death 
could 
sweeten 
every 
life 
with 
a 
precious 
and 
fragrant 
drop 
of 
levity—and 
now 
you 
strange 
apothecary 
souls 
have 
turned 
it 
into 
an 
ill-tasting 
drop 
of 
poison 
that 
makes 
the 
whole 
of 
life 
repulsive. 



323 


Remorse.— 
Never 
give 
way 
to 
remorse, 
but 
immediately 
say 
to 
yourself: 
that 
would 
merely 
mean 
adding 
a 
second 
stupidity 
to 
the 
first.— 
If 
you 
have 
done 
harm, 
see 
how 
you 
can 
do 
good.— 
If 
you 
are 
punished 
for 
your 
actions, 
bear 
the 
punishment 
with 
the 
feeling 
that 
you 
are 
doing 
good—by 
deterring 
others 
from 
falling 
prey 
to 
the 
same 
folly. 
Every 
evildoer 
who 
is 
punished 
may 
feel 
that 
he 
is 
a 
benefactor 
of 
humanity. 



326 


Don’t 
touch!— 
There 
are 
terrible 
people 
who, 
instead 
of 
solving 
a 
problem, 
bungle 
it 
and 
make 
it 
more 
difficult 
for 
all 
who 
come 
after. 
Whoever 
can’t 
hit 
the 
nail 
on 
the 
head 
should, 
please, 
not 
hit 
it 
at 
all.

Dying 
for

We 
should 
not 
let 
ourselves 
be 
burnt 
for 
our 
opinions: 
we 
are 
not 
that 
sure 
of 
them. 
But 
perhaps 
for 
this: 
that 
we 
may 
have 
and 
change 
our 
opinions.

Rationality 
ex 
post 
facto.— 
Whatever 
lives 
long 
is 
gradually 
so 
saturated 
with 
reason 
that 
its 
irrational 
origins 
become 
improbable. 
Does 
not 
almost 
every 
accurate 
history 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
something 
sound 
paradoxical 
and 
sacrilegious 
to 
our 
feelings? 
Doesn’t 
the 
good 
historian 
contradict 
all 
the 
time?

The 
morality 
of 
voluntary 
suffering.— 
What 
is 
the 
supreme 
enjoyment 
for 
men 
who 
live 
in 
the 
state 
of 
war 
of 
those 
small, 
continually 
endangered 
communities 
which 
are 
characterized 
by 
the 
strictest 
mores? 
In 
other 
words, 
for 
vigorous, 
vindictive, 
vicious, 
suspicious 
souls 
who 
are 
prepared 
for 
what 
is 
most 
terrible 
and 
hardened 
by 
deprivations 
and 
mores? 
The 
enjoyment 
of 
cruelty; 
and 
in 
these 
circumstances 
it 
is 
even 
accounted 
among 
the 
virtues 
of 
such 
a 
soul 
if 
it 
is 
inventive 
and 
insatiable 
in 
cruelty. 
The 
community 
feels 
refreshed 
by 
cruel 
deeds, 
and 
casts 
off 
for 
once 
the 
gloom 
of 
continual 
anxiety 
and 
caution. 
Cruelty 
belongs 
to 
the 
most 
ancient 
festive 
joys 
of 
mankind. 
Hence 
one 
supposes 
that 
the 
gods, 
too, 
feel 
refreshed 
and 
festive 
when 
one 
offers 
them 
the 
sight 
of 
cruelty; 
and 
so 
the 
idea 
creeps 
into 
the 
world 
that 
voluntary 
suffering, 
torture 
one 
has 
chosen 
oneself, 
has 
value 
and 
makes 
good 
sense. 


Gradually, 
the 
mores 
shape 
a 
communal 
practice 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
idea: 
all 
extravagant 
well-being 
henceforth 
arouses 
some 
mistrust, 
and 
all 
hard 
and 
painful 
states 
more 
and 
more 
confidence. 
One 
supposes 
that 
the 
gods 
might 
look 
upon 
us 
ungraciously 
because 
of 
our 
happiness, 
and 
graciously 
because 
of 
our 
suffering—not 
by 
any 
means 
with 
pity. 
For 
pity 
is 
considered 
contemptible 
and 
unworthy 
of 
a 
strong 
and 
terrible 
soul. 
Rather, 
graciously, 
because 
it 
delights 
them 
and 
puts 
them 
into 
good 
spirits; 
for 
those 
who 
are 
cruel 
enjoy 
the 
supreme 
titillation 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
power.1 


Thus 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“most 
moral 
man” 
of 
the 
community 
comes 
to 
contain 
the 
virtue 
of 
frequent 
suffering, 
deprivation, 
a 
hard 
way 
of 
life, 
and 
of 
cruel 
self-mortification—not, 
to 
say 
this 
again 
and 
again, 
as 
a 
means 
of 
self-
discipline, 
self-control, 
and 
the 
desire 
for 
individual 
happiness, 
but 
as 
a 
virtue 
that 
makes 
the 
community 
look 
good 
to 
the 
evil 
gods, 
steaming 
up 
to 
them 
like 
a 
continual 
sacrifice 
of 
atonement 
upon 
some 
altar. 
All 
those 
spiritual 
leaders 
of 
peoples 
who 
succeeded 
in 
stirring 
something 
in 
the 
inert 
but 
fertile 
mud 
of 
their 
mores, 
had 
need 
not 
only 
of 
madness 
but 
also 
of 
voluntary 
torture 
to 
engender 
faith—and 
most 
and 
first 
of 
all, 
as 
always, 
their 
faith 
in 
themselves. 
The 
more 
their 
own 
spirit 
moved 
along 
novel 
paths 
and 
was 



therefore 
tormented 
by 
pangs 
of 
conscience 
and 
anxieties, 
the 
more 
cruelly 
they 
raged 
against 
their 
own 
flesh, 
their 
own 
desires, 
and 
their 
own 
health— 
as 
if 
they 
wanted 
to 
offer 
the 
deity 
some 
substitute 
gratification 
in 
case 
it 
should 
perhaps 
be 
embittered 
on 
account 
of 
customs 
one 
had 
neglected 
and 
fought 
against 
and 
new 
goals 
one 
had 
championed. 


Let 
us 
not 
believe 
too 
quickly 
that 
now 
we 
have 
rid 
ourselves 
completely 
of 
such 
a 
logic 
of 
feeling. 
Let 
the 
most 
heroic 
souls 
question 
themselves 
about 
this. 
Every 
smallest 
step 
on 
the 
field 
of 
free 
thought 
and 
the 
individually 
formed 
life 
has 
always 
been 
fought 
for 
with 
spiritual 
and 
physical 
torments: 
not 
only 
moving 
forward, 
no, 
above 
all 
moving, 
motion, 
change 
have 
required 
innumerable 
martyrs, 
all 
through 
the 
long 
path-seeking 
and 
basic 
millennia 
of 
which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
people 
don’t 
think 
when 
they 
talk, 
as 
usual, 
about 
“world 
history,” 
that 
ridiculously 
small 
segment 
of 
human 
existence. 
And 
even 
in 
this 
so-called 
world 
history, 
which 
is 
at 
bottom 
much 
ado 
about 
the 
latest 
news, 
there 
is 
no 
really 
more 
important 
theme 
than 
the 
primordial 
tragedy 
of 
the 
martyrs 
who 
wanted 
to 
move 
the 
swamps. 


Nothing 
has 
been 
bought 
more 
dearly 
than 
that 
little 
bit 
of 
human 
reason 
and 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
freedom 
that 
now 
constitutes 
our 
pride. 
But 
it 
is 
this 
very 
pride 
that 
now 
makes 
it 
almost 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
feel 
with 
those 
vast 
spans 
of 
time 
characterized 
by 
the 
“morality 
of 
mores”2 
which 
antedate 
“world 
history” 
as 
the 
real 
and 
decisive 
main 
history 
that 
determined 
the 
character 
of 
humanity—when 
suffering 
was 
a 
virtue, 
cruelty 
a 
virtue, 
dissimulation 
a 
virtue, 
revenge 
a 
virtue, 
the 
slander 
of 
reason 
a 
virtue, 
while 
well-being 
was 
a 
danger, 
the 
craving 
for 
knowledge 
a 
danger, 
peace 
a 
danger, 
pity 
a 
danger, 
being 
pitied 
ignominy, 
work 
ignominy, 
madness 
divine, 
change 
immoral3 
and 
pregnant 
with 
disaster. 


You 
think 
that 
all 
this 
has 
changed, 
and 
that 
humanity 
must 
thus 
have 
changed 
its 
character? 
You 
who 
think 
you 
know 
men, 
learn 
to 
know 
yourselves 
better! 



112 


On 
the 
natural 
history 
of 
duty 
and 
right.— 
Our 
duties—are 
the 
rights 
others 
have 
against 
us. 
How 
did 
the 
others 
acquire 
these 
rights? 
By 
taking 
us 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
contracts 
and 
of 
repayment, 
as 
equal 
and 
similar 
to 
them; 
by 
entrusting 
us 
with 
something 
on 
this 
basis 
and 
educating, 
correcting, 
and 
supporting 
us. 
We 
do 
our 
duty—that 
means: 
we 
justify 
this 
idea 
of 
our 
power 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
which 
we 
have 
been 
treated 
this 
way; 
we 
give 
back 
in 
the 
same 
measure 
in 
which 
one 
has 
given 
to 
us. 
Thus 
it 
is 
our 
pride 
that 
bids 
us 
do 
our 
duty—we 
want 
to 
regain 
our 
sovereignty 
when 
we 
balance 
what 
others 
have 
done 
for 
us 
with 
something 
we 
do 
for 
them—for 
in 
this 
way 
they 
have 
intruded 
into 
the 
sphere 
of 
our 
power 
and 
would 
keep 
their 
hand 
in 
it 
constantly 
if 
we 
did 
not 
repay 
them 
with 
our 
“duty,” 
which 
means 
that 
we 
intrude 
into 
their 
power. 
The 
rights 
of 
others 
can 
relate 
only 
to 
what 
is 
within 
our 
power; 
it 
would 
be 
unreasonable 
if 
they 
wanted 
something 
from 
us 
that 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
us. 
To 
be 
more 
precise 
one 
should 
say: 
only 
to 
what 
they 
suppose 
is 
within 
our 
power, 
assuming 
that 
it 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
we 
suppose 
to 
be 
within 
our 
power. 
The 
same 
error 
could 
easily 
be 
made 
on 
both 
sides: 
the 
sense 
of 
a 
duty 
depends 
on 
our 
sharing 
with 
the 
others 
the 
same 
faith 
about 
the 
extent 
of 
our 
power: 
namely, 
that 
we 
promise 
certain 
things 
and 
are 
capable 
of 
incurring 
these 
duties 
(“freedom 
of 
the 
will”). 


My 
rights: 
they 
define 
that 
part 
of 
my 
power 
which 
the 
others 
have 
not 
only 
conceded 
to 
me 
but 
in 
which 
they 
wish 
to 
preserve 
me. 
What 
leads 
the 
others 
to 
do 
this? 
First, 
their 
prudence 
and 
fear 
and 
caution—whether 
they 
expect 
something 
similar 
in 
return 
from 
us 
(protection 
of 
their 
rights), 
or 
consider 
a 
fight 
with 
us 
dangerous 
or 
pointless, 
or 
see 
in 
every 
diminution 
of 
our 
strength 
a 
disadvantage 
for 
themselves 
because 
it 
would 
render 
us 
unfit 
for 
an 
alliance 
with 
them 
against 
a 
third 
and 
hostile 
power. 
Then, 
deeding 
or 
ceding. 
In 
this 
case 
the 
others 
have 
power 
enough, 
more 
than 
enough, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
give 
some 
of 
it 
away 
and 
to 
guarantee 
the 
piece 
they 
give 
away 
to 
the 
person 
who 
receives 
it—in 
which 
case 
a 
slight 
feeling 
of 
power 
is 
assumed 
in 
the 
person 
who 
accepts 
the 
present. 
Thus 
rights 
originate: 
recognized 
and 
guaranteed 
degrees 
of 
power. 
If 
the 
proportions 
of 
power 
are 
changed 
drastically, 
rights 
pass 
away, 
and 
new 
rights 
come 
to 
be—which 
is 
apparent 



in 
international 
law 
with 
its 
constant 
passing 
away 
and 
coming 
to 
be. 
If 
our 
power 
is 
decreased 
drastically, 
the 
feelings 
of 
those 
who 
have 
so 
far 
guaranteed 
our 
rights 
change: 
they 
consider 
whether 
they 
can 
restore 
us 
to 
our 
old 
full 
possession—and 
if 
they 
feel 
incapable 
of 
that, 
then 
they 
deny 
our 
“rights” 
henceforth. 
Just 
so, 
when 
our 
power 
is 
increased 
drastically, 
the 
feelings 
of 
those 
change 
who 
have 
so 
far 
recognized 
it 
and 
whose 
recognition 
we 
now 
no 
longer 
need: 
they 
may 
try 
to 
reduce 
our 
power 
to 
its 
former 
measure, 
they 
may 
wish 
to 
interfere, 
invoking 
their 
“duty”—but 
this 
is 
just 
a 
waste 
of 
words. 
Where 
right 
rules, 
a 
state 
and 
degree 
of 
power 
is 
preserved, 
and 
a 
diminution 
and 
increase 
are 
resisted. 
The 
right 
of 
others 
is 
the 
concession 
of 
our 
feeling 
of 
power 
to 
the 
feeling 
of 
power 
among 
these 
others. 
When 
our 
power 
is 
proved 
to 
have 
been 
profoundly 
shaken 
and 
broken, 
our 
rights 
cease; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
we 
have 
become 
a 
great 
deal 
more 
powerful, 
the 
rights 
of 
others 
cease 
for 
us, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
form 
in 
which 
we 
have 
so 
far 
conceded 
them. 


The 
“fair 
person” 
constantly 
needs 
the 
fine 
tact 
of 
a 
scale 
for 
the 
degrees 
of 
power 
and 
right 
which, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
transitory 
nature 
of 
human 
affairs, 
will 
always 
be 
balanced 
only 
for 
a 
short 
time, 
while 
for 
the 
most 
part 
they 
either 
sink 
or 
rise: 
to 
be 
fair 
is 
therefore 
difficult 
and 
requires 
much 
practice, 
good 
will, 
and 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
good 
spirit.— 



231 


Of 
German 
virtue.— 
How 
degenerate 
in 
taste, 
how 
slavish 
before 
offices, 
classes, 
robes, 
pomp, 
and 
splendor 
must 
a 
people 
have 
been 
when 
it 
evaluated 
the 
simple 
[schlicht] 
as 
the 
bad 
[schlecht], 
the 
simple 
man 
as 
the 
bad 
man! 
One 
should 
counter 
the 
moral 
arrogance 
of 
the 
Germans 
with 
this 
one 
little 
word, 
schlecht, 
and 
nothing 
more.4 



232 


From 
a 
disputation.— 
A: 
My 
friend, 
you 
have 
talked 
yourself 
hoarse. 
B: 
Then 
I 
stand 
refuted. 
Let 
us 
not 
discuss 
the 
matter 
any 
further. 



236 


Punishment.— 
A 
strange 
thing, 
our 
punishment! 
It 
does 
not 
cleanse 
the 
criminal, 
it 
is 
no 
atonement; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
pollutes 
worse 
than 
the 
crime 
does. 


The 
Gay 
Science 
(1882) 



51 


Sense 
of 
truth.— 
I 
think 
well 
of 
all 
skepticism 
to 
which 
I 
may 
reply: 
“Let 
us 
try 
it.” 
But 
I 
no 
longer 
want 
to 
hear 
anything 
of 
all 
those 
things 
and 
questions 
which 
do 
not 
permit 
experiments. 
This 
is 
the 
limit 
of 
my 
“sense 
of 
truth”: 
for 
there 
courage 
has 
lost 
its 
rights. 



108 


New 
struggles.— 
After 
Buddha 
was 
dead, 
his 
shadow 
was 
still 
shown 
for 
centuries 
in 
a 
cave—a 
tremendous, 
gruesome 
shadow. 
God 
is 
dead: 
but 
given 
the 
way 
men 
are, 
there 
may 
still 
be 
caves 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
in 
which 
his 
shadow 
will 
be 
shown.— 
And 
we—we 
still 
have 
to 
vanquish 
his 
shadow, 
too.1 



121 


Life 
no 
argument.— 
We 
have 
fixed 
up 
a 
world 
for 
ourselves 
in 
which 
we 
can 
live—assuming 
bodies, 
lines, 
planes, 
causes 
and 
effects, 
motion 
and 
rest, 
form 
and 
content: 
without 
these 
articles 
of 
faith, 
nobody 
now 
would 
endure 
life. 
But 
that 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
they 
have 
been 
proved. 
Life 
is 
no 
argument; 
the 
conditions 
of 
life 
could 
include 
error.2 



129 


The 
conditions 
of 
God.— 
“God 
himself 
cannot 
exist 
without 
wise 
men”— 
Luther 
said, 
and 
was 
right. 
But 
“God 
can 
exist 
even 
less 
without 
unwise 
men”—that 
good 
old 
Luther 
did 
not 
say. 



130 


A 
dangerous 
resolve.— 
The 
Christian 
resolve 
to 
find 
the 
world 
ugly 
and 
bad 
has 
made 
the 
world 
ugly 
and 
bad. 



142 


Incense.— 
Buddha 
said: 
“Do 
not 
flatter 
your 
benefactor.” 
This 
saying 
should 
be 
repeated 
in 
a 
Christian 
church—right 
away 
it 
clears 
the 
air 
of 
everything 
Christian. 



163 


After 
a 
great 
victory.— 
What 
is 
best 
about 
a 
great 
victory 
is 
that 
it 
rids 
the 
victor 
of 
fear 
of 
defeat. 
“Why 
not 
also 
lose 
for 
once?” 
he 
says 
to 
himself; 
“now 
I 
am 
rich 
enough 
for 
that.” 



173 


Being 
deep 
and 
appearing 
deep.— 
Whoever 
knows 
he 
is 
deep, 
strives 
for 
clarity; 
whoever 
would 
like 
to 
appear 
deep 
to 
the 
crowd, 
strives 
for 
obscurity. 
For 
the 
crowd 
considers 
anything 
deep 
if 
only 
it 
cannot 
see 
to 
the 
bottom: 
the 
crowd 
is 
so 
timid 
and 
afraid 
of 
going 
into 
the 
water. 



200 


Laughter.— 
Laughter 
means: 
being 
schadenfroh,3 
but 
with 
a 
good 
conscience. 



205 


Need.— 
A 
need 
is 
considered 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
origin: 
in 
truth, 
it 
is 
often 
merely 
an 
effect 
of 
what 
did 
originate. 



228 


Against 
mediators.— 
Those 
who 
wish 
to 
be 
mediators 
between 
two 
resolute 
thinkers 
are 
marked 
as 
mediocre: 
they 
lack 
eyes 
to 
see 
the 
unparalleled; 
seeing 
things 
as 
similar 
and 
making 
them 
the 
same 
is 
the 
mark 
of 
weak 
eyes. 



231 


“Thorough”— 
Those 
slow 
in 
knowledge 
suppose 
that 
slowness 
belongs 
to 
knowledge.4 



232 


Dreams.— 
We 
have 
no 
dreams 
at 
all 
or 
interesting 
ones. 
We 
should 
learn 
to 
be 
awake 
the 
same 
way—not 
at 
all 
or 
in 
an 
interesting 
manner. 



258 


Those 
who 
deny 
chance.— 
No 
victor 
believes 
in 
chance. 



273 


Whom 
do 
you 
call 
bad?— 
Those 
who 
always 
want 
to 
put 
to 
shame. 



274 


What 
do 
you 
consider 
most 
humane?— 
To 
spare 
someone 
shame. 



275 


What 
is 
the 
seal 
of 
attained 
freedom?— 
No 
longer 
being 
ashamed 
in 
front 
of 
oneself. 



292 


To 
the 
preachers 
of 
morals.— 
I 
have 
no 
wish 
to 
establish 
morals, 
but 
I 
have 
this 
advice 
for 
those 
who 
do: 
if 
you 
want 
to 
do 
the 
best 
things 
and 
states 
out 
of 
all 
honor 
and 
worth, 
then 
continue 
to 
talk 
about 
them 
as 
you 
have 
been 
doing. 
Place 
them 
at 
the 
head 
of 
your 
morality 
and 
talk 
from 
morning 
till 
night 
of 
the 
happiness 
of 
virtue, 
of 
peace 
of 
soul, 
of 
justice 
and 
immanent 
retribution: 
the 
way 
you 
are 
carrying 
on, 
all 
these 
good 
things 
finally 
acquire 
a 
popularity 
and 
are 
shouted 
about 
in 
the 
streets; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
all 
of 
their 
gold 
will 
be 
worn 
off, 
and 
even 
worse—all 
the 
gold 
that 
was 
in 
them 
will 
have 
been 
changed 
to 
lead. 
Truly, 
you 
are 
masters 
of 
inverse 
alchemy, 
of 
the 
devaluation 
of 
the 
most 
valuable 
things. 
Why 
don’t 
you 
reach, 
experimentally, 
for 
another 
recipe, 
lest 
you 
keep 
attaining 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
you 
seek: 
deny 
these 
good 
things, 
deprive 
them 
of 
the 
mob’s 
acclaim 
and 
their 
constant 
currency; 
restore 
them 
to 
the 
concealed 
bashfulness 
of 
solitary 
souls; 
say 
that 
morality 
is 
something 
forbidden. 
Perhaps 
you 
will 
in 
that 
way 
gain 
the 
support 
for 
these 
things 
of 
the 
only 
type 
of 
men 
that 
matter 
—those 
who 
are 
heroic. 
But 
then 
they 
must 
have 
a 
quality 
that 
inspires 
fear, 
and 
not, 
as 
hitherto, 
nausea. 
Should 
we 
not 
say 
of 
morality 
today 
what 
Master 
Eckhart5 
said: 
“I 
ask 
God 
that 
he 
rid 
me 
of 
God.” 



312 


My 
dog.— 
I 
have 
given 
a 
name 
to 
my 
pain 
and 
call 
it 
“dog”: 
it 
is 
just 
as 
faithful, 
just 
as 
obtrusive 
and 
shameless, 
just 
as 
entertaining, 
just 
as 
clever 
as 
any 
other 
dog—and 
I 
can 
scold 
it 
and 
vent 
my 
bad 
moods 
on 
it, 
as 
others 
do 
with 
their 
dogs, 
servants, 
and 
wives. 



316 


Prophetic 
men.— 
You 
have 
no 
feeling 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
prophetic 
men 
are 
men 
who 
suffer 
a 
great 
deal: 
you 
merely 
suppose 
that 
they 
have 
been 
granted 
a 
beautiful 
“gift,” 
and 
you 
would 
even 
like 
to 
have 
it 
yourself. 
But 
I 
shall 
express 
myself 
in 
a 
parable. 
How 
much 
may 
animals 
suffer 
from 
the 
electricity 
in 
the 
air 
and 
clouds! 
We 
see 
how 
some 
species 
have 
a 
prophetic 
faculty 
regarding 
the 
weather; 
monkeys, 
for 
example 
(as 
may 
be 
observed 
even 
in 
Europe, 
and 
not 
only 
in 
zoos—namely, 
on 
Gibraltar). 
But 
we 
do 
not 
heed 
that 
it 
is 
their 
pains 
that 
make 
them 
prophets. 
When 
a 
strong 
positive 
electrical 
charge, 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
an 
approaching 
cloud 
that 
is 
as 
yet 
far 
from 
visible, 
suddenly 
changes 
into 
negative 
electricity, 
these 
animals 
behave 
as 
if 
an 
enemy 
were 
drawing 
near 
and 
prepare 
for 
defense 
or 
escape; 
most 
often 
they 
try 
to 
hide: 
they 
do 
not 
understand 
bad 
weather 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
weather 
but 
as 
an 
enemy 
whose 
hand 
they 
already 
feel. 



322 


Parable.— 
Those 
thinkers 
in 
whom 
all 
stars 
move 
in 
cyclic 
orbits 
are 
not 
the 
most 
profound: 
whoever 
looks 
into 
himself 
as 
into 
vast 
space 
and 
carries 
galaxies 
in 
himself 
also 
knows 
how 
irregular 
all 
galaxies 
are; 
they 
lead 
into 
the 
chaos 
and 
labyrinth 
of 
existence. 



325 


What 
belongs 
to 
greatness.— 
Who 
will 
attain 
anything 
great 
if 
he 
does 
not 
possess 
the 
strength 
and 
the 
will 
to 
inflict 
great 
suffering? 
Being 
able 
to 
suffer 
is 
the 
least 
thing: 
weak 
women 
and 
even 
slaves 
often 
attain 
mastery 
in 
that. 
But 
not 
to 
perish 
of 
inner 
distress 
and 
uncertainty 
when 
one 
inflicts 
great 
suffering 
and 
hears 
the 
cry 
of 
this 
suffering—that 
is 
great, 
that 
belongs 
to 
greatness.6 



327 


Taking 
seriously.— 
In 
the 
great 
majority, 
the 
intellect 
is 
a 
clumsy, 
gloomy, 
creaking 
machine 
that 
is 
difficult 
to 
start. 
They 
call 
it 
“taking 
the 
matter 
seriously,” 
when 
they 
work 
with 
this 
machine 
and 
want 
to 
think 
well: 
how 
onerous 
they 
must 
find 
thinking 
well! 
The 
lovely 
beast, 
man, 
seems 
to 
lose 
its 
good 
spirits 
every 
time 
it 
thinks 
well: 
it 
becomes 
“serious.” 
And 
“where 
laughter 
and 
gaiety 
are 
found, 
the 
quality 
of 
thought 
is 
poor”—that 
is 
the 
prejudice 
of 
this 
serious 
beast 
against 
all 
“gay 
science.”— 
Well, 
then, 
let 
us 
prove 
that 
it 
is 
a 
prejudice.7 



332 


The 
bad 
hour.— 
Every 
philosopher 
has 
probably 
had 
a 
bad 
hour 
when 
he 
thought: 
what 
do 
I 
matter 
if 
one 
does 
not 
accept 
my 
bad 
arguments, 
too?— 
And 
then 
some 
mischievous8 
little 
bird 
flew 
past 
him 
and 
twittered: 
“What 
do 
you 
matter? 
What 
do 
you 
matter?” 



3819 


On 
the 
question 
of 
being 
understandable.— 
One 
does 
not 
only 
wish 
to 
be 
understood 
when 
one 
writes; 
one 
wishes 
just 
as 
surely 
not 
to 
be 
understood. 
It 
is 
not 
by 
any 
means 
necessarily 
an 
objection 
to 
a 
book 
when 
anybody 
finds 
it 
impossible 
to 
understand: 
perhaps 
that 
was 
part 
of 
the 
author’s 
intention— 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
be 
understood 
by 
just 
“anybody.” 
Every 
more 
noble 
spirit 
and 
taste 
selects 
its 
audience 
when 
it 
wishes 
to 
communicate 
itself; 
and 
choosing 
them, 
it 
at 
the 
same 
time 
erects 
barriers 
against 
“the 
others.” 
All 
the 
more 
subtle 
laws 
of 
any 
style 
have 
their 
origin 
at 
this 
point: 
they 
at 
the 
same 
time 
keep 
away, 
create 
a 
distance, 
forbid 
“entrance,” 
understanding, 
as 
said 
above—while 
they 
open 
the 
ears 
of 
those 
whose 
ears 
are 
related 
to 
ours. 


And 
let 
me 
say 
this 
among 
ourselves 
and 
about 
my 
own 
case: 
I 
don’t 
want 
either 
my 
ignorance 
or 
the 
liveliness 
of 
my 
temperament 
to 
keep 
me 
from 
being 
understandable 
for 
you, 
my 
friends—not 
the 
liveliness, 
however 
much 
it 
compels 
me 
to 
tackle 
a 
matter 
swiftly 
to 
tackle 
it 
at 
all. 
For 
I 
approach 
deep 
problems 
like 
cold 
baths: 
quickly 
into 
them 
and 
quickly 
out 
again. 
That 
one 
does 
not 
get 
to 
the 
depths 
that 
way, 
not 
deep 
enough 
down, 
is 
the 
superstition 
of 
those 
afraid 
of 
the 
water, 
the 
enemies 
of 
cold 
water; 
they 
speak 
without 
experience. 
The 
freezing 
cold 
makes 
one 
swift. 


And 
to 
ask 
this 
incidentally: 
does 
a 
matter 
necessarily 
remain 
ununderstood 
and 
unfathomed 
merely 
because 
it 
has 
been 
touched 
only 
in 
flight, 
glanced 
at, 
in 
a 
flash? 
Is 
it 
absolutely 
imperative 
that 
one 
settles 
down 
on 
it? 
that 
one 
has 
brooded 
over 
it 
as 
over 
an 
egg? 
Diu 
noctuque 
incubando, 
as 
Newton 
said 
of 
himself? 
At 
least 
there 
are 
truths 
that 
are 
singularly 
shy 
and 
ticklish 
and 
cannot 
be 
caught 
except 
suddenly—that 
must 
be 
surprised 
or 
left 
alone. 


Finally, 
my 
brevity 
has 
yet 
another 
value: 
given 
such 
questions 
as 
concern 
me, 
I 
must 
say 
many 
things 
briefly 
in 
order 
that 
they 
may 
be 
heard 
still 
more 
briefly. 
For, 
being 
an 
immoralist, 
one 
has 
to 
take 
steps 
against 
corrupting 
innocents—I 
mean, 
asses 
and 
old 
maids 
of 
both 
sexes 
whom 
life 
offers 
nothing 
but 
their 
innocence. 
Even 
more, 
my 
writings 
should 
inspire, 
elevate, 
and 
encourage 
them 
to 
be 
virtuous. 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
anything 
on 
earth 
that 
would 
be 
a 
merrier 
sight 
than 
inspired 
old 
asses 
and 
maids 
who 
feel 
excited 



by 
the 
sweet 
sentiments 
of 
virtue; 
and 
“this 
I 
have 
seen”— 
thus 
spoke 
Zarathustra. 


So 
much 
regarding 
brevity. 
Matters 
stand 
worse 
with 
my 
ignorance 
which 
I 
do 
not 
try 
to 
conceal 
from 
myself. 
There 
are 
hours 
when 
I 
feel 
ashamed 
of 
it 
—to 
be 
sure, 
also 
hours 
when 
I 
feel 
ashamed 
of 
feeling 
ashamed. 
Perhaps 
all 
of 
us 
philosophers 
are 
in 
a 
bad 
position 
nowadays 
regarding 
knowledge: 
science 
keeps 
growing, 
and 
the 
most 
scholarly 
among 
us 
are 
close 
to 
discovering 
that 
they 
know 
too 
little. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
still 
worse 
if 
it 
were 
different—and 
we 
knew 
too 
much; 
our 
task 
is 
and 
remains 
above 
all 
not 
to 
mistake 
ourselves 
for 
others. 
We 
are 
something 
different 
from 
scholars, 
although 
it 
is 
unavoidable 
for 
us 
to 
be 
also, 
among 
other 
things, 
scholarly. 
We 
have 
different 
needs, 
grow 
differently, 
and 
also 
have 
a 
different 
digestion: 
we 
need 
more, 
we 
also 
need 
less. 
How 
much 
a 
spirit 
needs 
for 
its 
nourishment, 
for 
this 
there 
is 
no 
formula; 
but 
if 
its 
taste 
is 
for 
independence, 
for 
quick 
coming 
and 
going, 
for 
roaming, 
perhaps 
for 
adventures 
for 
which 
only 
the 
swiftest 
are 
a 
match, 
it 
is 
better 
for 
such 
a 
spirit 
to 
live 
in 
freedom 
with 
little 
to 
eat 
than 
unfree 
and 
stuffed. 
It 
is 
not 
fat 
but 
the 
greatest 
possible 
suppleness 
and 
strength 
that 
a 
good 
dancer 
desires 
from 
his 
nourishment— 
and 
I 
would 
not 
know 
what 
the 
spirit 
of 
a 
philosopher 
might 
wish 
more 
to 
be 
than 
a 
good 
dancer. 
For 
the 
dance 
is 
his 
ideal, 
also 
his 
art, 
and 
finally 
also 
his 
only 
piety, 
his 
“service 
of 
God.” 


1 
The 
theme 
of 
this 
section 
is 
taken 
up 
again 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
(1886), 
section 
260, 
where 
we 
gain 
the 
distinct 
impression—though 
Nietzsche 
is 
not 
as 
emphatic 
as 
in 
the 
last 
sentence 
above—that 
our 
current 
morality 
is 
a 
mixed 
type. 
It 
would 
seem 
that 
this 
became 
his 
considered 
view, 
notwithstanding 
the 
widespread 
misapprehension 
that 
he 
considered 
modern 
morality 
an 
example 
of 
“slave 
morality.” 
Most 
important: 
as 
the 
above 
aphorism 
makes 
abundantly 
clear, 
Nietzsche 
is 
not 
concerned 
to 
divide 
the 
men 
among 
whom 
he 
lives 
into 
masters 
and 
slaves; 
he 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
history, 
the 
genesis, 
the 
genealogy 
of 
morals. 
And 
in 
the 
Preface 
to 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals 
(1887), 
Nietzsche 
refers 
to 
several 
early 
aphorisms, 
including 
this 
one. 


2 
Die 
Gerechtigkeit 
(Billigkeit) 
… 
3 
Sitte 
und 
sittlich: 
wherever 
Nietzsche 
pairs 
these 
words, 
they 
are 
translated 
as 
above, 
and 
unsittlich 
is 
rendered 
as 
immoral. 
Elsewhere, 



Nietzsche 
often 
uses 
such 
words 
as 
Moral, 
moralisch, 
lmmoralist—e.g., 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
and 
in 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals 
(not 
only 
in 
the 
title 
of 
the 
latter 
book)—and 
morality, 
morals, 
moral, 
and 
immoralist 
have 
been 
used 
to 
render 
them.

German 
romantic

This 
is 
the 
final 
aphorism 
with 
which 
the 
book, 
published 
in 
1879, 
ended. 
In 
a 
later 
note 
(Musarion 
edition, 
1920–29, 
vol. 
XIV, 
p. 
109) 
Nietzsche 
jotted 
down: 
“My 
ancestors: 
Heraclitus, 
Empedocles, 
Spinoza, 
Goethe.” 
And 
his 
eyes 
were 
much 
more 
consistently 
fixed 
on 
Socrates 
than 
on 
Epicurus 
and 
Montaigne. 
His 
references 
to 
Pascal 
and 
Rousseau, 
especially 
Rousseau, 
are 
generally 
very 
critical.

A 
remarkably 
clear 
and 
vivid 
statement 
of 
a 
point 
that 
is 
widely 
held 
to 
be 
one 
of 
Ludwig 
Wittgenstein’s 
major 
contributions 
to 
philosophy; 
cf. 
Wittgenstein’s 
Philosophical 
Investigations 
(1953), 
sections 
65ff. 
The 
great 
antipode 
of 
Nietzsche 
and 
Wittgenstein 
is 
Plato’s 
theory 
of 
ideas, 
which 
holds 
that 
all 
the 
instances 
called 
by 
the 
same 
name 
participate 
in 
the 
same 
idea 
or 
form 
which 
alone 
embodies 
to 
perfection 
the 
quality 
named.

Meister

(1260–1327) 
was 
the 
greatest 
German 
mystic 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages.

This 
aphorism 
is 
surely 
quite 
as 
much 
prompted 
by 
personal 
experience 
as 
the 
three 
that 
precede 
it: 
Nietzsche 
is 
thinking 
of 
the 
suffering 
that 
his 
ideas 
and 
books 
inflict 
on 
his 
mother, 
the 
Wagner 
circle, 
and 
those 
whose 
pieties 
he 
offends. 


7 
This 
aphorism, 
and 
the 
whole 
conception 
of 
the 
“gay 
science,” 
should 
be 
recalled 
in 
connection 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
inquiry 
concerning 
“ascetic 
ideals” 
in 
the 
Genealogy. 
Science 
and 
scholarship, 
he 
argues 
there, 
involve 
variations 
of 
asceticism. 
But 
his 
solution 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
renouncing 
reason: 
he 
wants 
to 
develop 
a 
“gay 
science.”

Preface 


Nietzsche 
was 
controversial 
to 
the 
marrow. 
He 
sought 
controversy 
and 
is 
still 
controversial. 
But 
the 
area 
of 
agreement 
about 
him 
is 
growing. 
What 
the 
Germans 
and 
the 
French 
have 
known 
for 
some 
time 
is 
gradually 
being 
recognized 
in 
the 
English-speaking 
world 
as 
well: 
Nietzsche 
was 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
German 
writers 
and 
philosophers 
of 
all 
time 
and 
one 
of 
the 
most 
interesting 
and 
influential 
Europeans 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century. 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
is 
one 
of 
his 
most 
important 
books, 
and 
its 
nine 
parts 
with 
their 
descriptive 
subtitles 
are 
designed 
to 
give 
the 
reader 
a 
comprehensive 
idea 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
thought 
and 
style. 


For 
all 
that, 
the 
book, 
like 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
best 
volumes, 
is 
easily 
misunderstood. 
For 
readers 
who 
come 
to 
it 
with 
no 
previous 
knowledge 
of 
Nietzsche 
or 
with 
erroneous 
preconceptions 
about 
him, 
I 
have 
ventured 
to 
offer 
something 
of 
a 
commentary 
in 
the 
form 
of 
copious 
footnotes. 
All 
of 
the 
footnotes 
are 
mine; 
none 
are 
Nietzsche’s. 


I 
have 
chosen 
to 
use 
notes 
for 
elucidation 
of 
major 
and 
minor 
points 
in 
the 
text 
rather 
than 
a 
long 
introduction 
or 
interlarded 
commentaries 
because 
such 
notes 
can 
provide 
immediate 
clarification 
or 
interpretation 
for 
the 
reader 
who 
requires 
such 
assistance. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
reader 
can 
skip 
the 
notes 
if 
he 
wishes, 
and 
read 
Nietzsche 
straight 
through 
without 
the 
intrusion 
of 
the 
editor’s 
commentaries. 


Another 
possibility 
would 
have 
been 
to 
offer 
the 
commentary 
on 
facing 
pages, 
as 
I 
myself 
have 
done 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Hegel’s 
long 
Preface 
to 
the 
Phenomenology. 
But 
Nietzsche’s 
book 
is 
not 
that 
difficult: 
one 
can 
read 
it 
like 
an 
ordinary 
book, 
and 
many 
pages 
require 
no 
elucidation. 
Everything 
considered, 
then, 
it 
seemed 
best 
to 
offer 
the 
commentary 
in 
the 
form 
of 
notes 
—none 
on 
some 
pages, 
several 
on 
others. 


To 
keep 
down 
the 
length 
of 
the 
commentary 
and 
to 
avoid 
excessive 
repetition 
of 
material 
available 
elsewhere, 
I 
have 
referred 
to 
detailed 
discussion 
of 
many 
points 
in 
my 
own 
Nietzsche 
volume. 



2 


A 
word 
about 
the 
text: 
it 
was 
originally 
published 
in 
1886, 
following 
Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra, 
which 
is 
generally 
and 
rightly 
regarded 
as 
Nietzsche’s 
first 
attempt 
to 
present 
his 
whole 
philosophy. 
All 
of 
his 
previous 
works 
had 
been 
stages 
in 
his 
development: 
with 
Zarathustra 
the 
final 
phase 
begins; 
a 
comprehensive 
vision 
has 
been 
attained 
but 
is 
far 
from 
easy 
to 
communicate. 
Zarathustra, 
though 
much 
of 
the 
work 
consists 
of 
apparently 
direct 
preaching, 
is 
a 
form 
of 
“indirect 
communication,” 
to 
use 
Kierkegaard’s 
term: 
the 
form 
is 
literary 
and 
there 
is 
an 
abundance 
of 
symbolism. 
For 
those 
who 
know 
the 
author 
well, 
the 
book 
is 
a 
stunning 
epitome 
of 
his 
thought; 
for 
those 
who 
do 
not, 
some 
other 
approach 
is 
needed. 
It 
was 
with 
this 
in 
mind 
that 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil. 
And 
on 
September 
22, 
1886, 
he 
wrote 
Jacob 
Burckhardt: 
“Please 
read 
this 
book 
(although 
it 
says 
the 
same 
things 
as 
my 
Zarathustra, 
but 
differently, 
very 
differently—).” 


The 
first 
edition 
was 
the 
only 
one 
that 
Nietzsche 
himself 
supervised. 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
his 
friend 
Franz 
Overbeck, 
he 
wrote: 
“I 
am 
making 
the 
experiment 
of 
having 
something 
published 
at 
my 
expense: 
assuming 
300 
copies 
will 
be 
sold, 
my 
expenses 
will 
be 
covered 
and 
I 
might 
be 
able 
to 
repeat 
the 
experiment 
some 
time. 
The 
firm 
of 
C. 
G. 
Naumann 
permits 
the 
use 
of 
its 
highly 
respectable 
name. 
This 
between 
us. 
The 
neglect 
by 
Schm.1 
was 
monstrous: 
for 
ten 
years 
now 
no 
copies 
distributed 
to 
bookstores; 
neither 
any 
review 
copies 
… 
no 
promotion—in 
short, 
my 
writings 
beginning 
with 
Human, 
All-
Too-Human 
are 
‘anecdota.’ 
Of 
Zarathustra 
60–70 
copies 
each2 
have 
been 
sold, 
etc., 
etc.”3 
The 
book 
of 
which 
Nietzsche 
had 
hoped 
to 
sell 
300 
copies 
was 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
but 
a 
year 
later, 
June 
8, 
1887, 
he 
writes 
Peter 
Gast: 
“This 
time, 
for 
Bey. 
G. 
& 
E., 
everything 
necessary 
(and 
even 
a 
little 
more 
than 
that) 
has 
been 
done 
as 
far 
as 
the 
book 
trade 
is 
concerned: 
so 
Herr 
Schmeitzner 
cannot 
be 
blamed 
any 
more, 
as 
I 
had 
done 
so 
far. 
In 
spite 
of 
all 
this—the 
result 
is 
the 
same 
as 
with 
Schmeitzner: 
rather, 
it 
is 
still 
worse! 
Altogether 
only 
114 
copies 
have 
been 
sold 
(while 
66 
copies 
have 
been 
given 
away 
to 
newspapers 
and 
journals). 


“Instructive! 
Namely, 
one 
simply 
does 
not 
want 
my 
literature; 
and 
I—may 



no 
longer 
afford 
the 
luxury 
of 
print.”4 
By 
1903, 
17,000 
copies 
were 
in 
print; 
by 
1906, 
36,000. 
Since 
then 
new 
editions 
and 
translations 
into 
other 
languages 
have 
mushroomed. 


The 
first 
edition 
has 
become 
a 
great 
rarity 
and 
has 
never 
been 
reprinted 
exactly 
as 
published 
in 
1886. 
All 
subsequent 
editions 
contain 
a 
few 
very 
minor 
deviations. 
Karl 
Schlechta’s 
edition 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works 
in 
three 
volumes5 
is 
widely 
considered 
vastly 
superior 
to 
all 
previous 
editions, 
at 
least 
philologically, 
although 
it 
contains 
much 
less 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
Nachiass6 
than 
some 
earlier 
editions; 
and 
Schlechta 
claims 
unequivocally 
that 
he 
has 
followed 
the 
original 
edition, 
published 
by 
C. 
G. 
Naumann 
(Leipzig, 
1886),7 
but 
he 
has 
not. 
Where 
the 
standard 
editions 
differ 
from 
the 
original 
edition, 
he 
follows 
the 
later 
editions.8 
No 
matter 
of 
philosophical 
substance 
is 
involved; 
the 
deviations 
are 
very 
small; 
but 
the 
fact 
remains 
astonishing. 
Notwithstanding 
all 
sorts 
of 
sensational 
claims, 
none 
of 
the 
scholarly 
corrections 
of 
the 
older 
editions 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
writings, 
published 
since 
World 
War 
II, 
are 
important 
philosophically, 
and 
it 
is 
ironical 
that 
the 
editions 
of 
Schlechta 
and 
Podach9 
are 
by 
no 
means 
models 
of 
belated 
philological 
soundness.10 
This 
translation 
follows 
the 
first 
edition. 
In 
my 
footnote 
commentary, 
deviations 
of 
the 
later 
editions 
are 
pointed 
out. 


I 
have 
taken 
two 
liberties. 
Nietzsche 
occasionally 
uses 
dots, 
usually 
four, 
as 
a 
punctuation 
mark; 
for 
example, 
but 
by 
no 
means 
there 
alone, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
sections 
62 
and 
227. 
In 
serious 
works 
in 
the 
English-speaking 
world 
dots 
are 
so 
generally 
taken 
to 
indicate 
omissions 
that 
it 
did 
not 
seem 
advisable 
to 
follow 
Nietzsche’s 
usage. 
Dashes 
have 
therefore 
been 
used 
instead. 
Moreover, 
Nietzsche 
often 
employs 
dots 
or 
dashes 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
lengthy 
paragraphs. 
In 
such 
cases 
I 
have 
often 
begun 
a 
new 
paragraph 
to 
mark 
the 
break; 
and 
beyond 
that, 
I 
have 
generally 
broken 
up 
long 
paragraphs. 
The 
reader 
may 
always 
assume 
that 
in 
the 
original 
a 
numbered 
section 
constitutes 
a 
single 
paragraph; 
even 
if 
it 
is 
as 
long 
as 
the 
whole 
Preface 
or 
sections 
25, 
26, 
and 
28. 



3 


Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
has 
been 
translated 
into 
English 
twice 
before. 
The 
first 
translator, 
Helen 
Zimmern, 
was 
an 
English 
writer 
who 
had 
met 
Nietzsche 
in 
Sils 
Maria 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
1886—the 
period 
when 
the 
book 
was 
completed, 
printed, 
and 
published. 
Indeed, 
Nietzsche 
mentions 
her 
in 
the 
margin 
of 
the 
letter 
to 
Franz 
Overbeck 
previously 
cited: 
“Till 
the 
middle 
of 
September 
I 
shall 
stay 
here. 
There 
is 
no 
dearth 
of 
old 
acquaintances 
… 
Miss 
Helen 
Zimmern 
…” 


In 
the 
index 
of 
names 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
Briefe 
an 
Peter 
Gast, 
Helen 
Zimmern 
is 
identified 
as 
an 
“English 
writer”; 
in 
the 
index 
to 
Briefe 
an 
Mutter 
und 
Schwester 
(letters 
to 
mother 
and 
sister, 
Leipzig, 
1909), 
as 
“engl. 
Litteratin,” 
which 
is 
less 
respectful. 
Neither 
volume 
mentions 
that 
she 
translated 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil. 
What 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
(September 
19, 
1886) 
about 
her 
to 
his 
mother 
or 
sister 
was: 
“I 
had 
the 
privilege 
of 
introducing 
this 
‘champion 
of 
women’s 
rights’ 
(Frl. 
von 
Salis) 
to 
another 
‘champion’ 
who 
is 
my 
neighbor 
at 
meals, 
Miss 
Helen 
Zimmern, 
who 
is 
extremely 
clever, 
incidentally 
not 
an 
Englishwoman—but 
Jewish. 
May 
heaven 
have 
mercy 
on 
the 
European 
intellect 
if 
one 
wanted 
to 
subtract 
the 
Jewish 
intellect 
from 
it.”11 
In 
1885, 
the 
year 
before, 
Nietzsche’s 
sister 
had 
married 
Bernhard 
Förster, 
one 
of 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
German 
anti-Semitic 
movement.12 
Helen 
Zimmern 
(1846–1934), 
two 
years 
Nietzsche’s 
junior, 
had 
published 
Arthur 
Schopenhauer: 
His 
Life 
and 
His 
Philosophy 
(1876) 
and 
Gotthold 
Ephraim 
Lessing: 
His 
Life 
and 
His 
Works 
(1878); 
she 
also 
published 
many 
other 
books 
and 
translations, 
including 
several 
from 
the 
Italian. 
About 
her 
version 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
Dr. 
Oscar 
Levy 
reported 
in 
1913 
in 
a 
short 
essay 
on 
“The 
Nietzsche 
Movement 
in 
England” 
(in 
the 
last 
volume, 
the 
eighteenth, 
of 
his 
edition 
of 
The 
Complete 
Works): 
“But 
in 
1907 
the 
party 
had 
somewhat 
recovered 
its 
spirit, 
and 
as 
a 
last 
experiment 
brought 
out 
a 
translation 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil—this 
time 
at 
private 
risk, 
for 
no 
publisher 
could 
be 
induced 
to 
take 
up 
an 
author 
twice 
repudiated. 
This 
translation 
was 
one 
which 
had 
been 
made 
nearly 
ten 
years 
ago, 
but 
until 
then 
had 
never 
seen, 
and 
was 
never 
expected 
to 
see, 
the 
light 
of 
publicity. 
It 
turned 



out 
to 
be 
a 
success—a 
half-hearted 
success 
perhaps, 
but 
one 
that 
at 
last 
told 
the 
few 
inmates 
of 
the 
Nietzschean 
ark 
that 
the 
waters 
of 
democracy 
had 
diminished, 
and 
that 
at 
least 
some 
higher 
peaks 
of 
humanity 
were 
free 
from 
the 
appalling 
deluge. 
The 
success 
encouraged 
them 
once 
more 
to 
take 
up 
their 
old 
project 
of 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
complete 
works.…” 


The 
“inmates” 
in 
England 
were 
a 
very 
different 
lot 
from 
those 
who 
were 
by 
then 
writing 
about 
Nietzsche 
in 
Germany 
and 
France: 
English 
professional 
philosophers, 
for 
example, 
had 
developed 
curious 
versions 
of 
Hegelianism 
after 
Hegel 
had 
gone 
into 
eclipse 
on 
the 
continent, 
and 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
the 
young 
G. 
E. 
Moore 
and 
Bertrand 
Russell 
were 
trying 
to 
emancipate 
philosophy 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
leading 
Idealists, 
F. 
H. 
Bradley 
and 
J. 
M. 
E. 
McTaggart. 
The 
tone 
of 
the 
English 
Nietzscheans, 
in 
turn, 
helped 
to 
create 
a 
public 
image 
of 
Nietzsche 
that 
did 
not 
attract 
philosophers 
to 
him. 


It 
was 
over 
fifty 
years 
after 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
had 
originally 
appeared 
in 
1886 
that 
professional 
philosophers 
began 
to 
publish 
studies 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
philosophy 
in 
English. 


Meanwhile, 
the 
Zimmern 
translation 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
found 
its 
way 
into 
the 
Modern 
Library, 
and 
it 
was 
until 
1955 
the 
only 
version 
through 
which 
myriads 
of 
readers 
knew 
the 
book. 
In 
preparing 
the 
present 
edition, 
I 
hoped 
at 
first 
that 
I 
might 
merely 
revise 
her 
version, 
modernizing 
her 
somewhat 
Victorian 
prose 
and 
correcting 
mistakes; 
but 
I 
soon 
gave 
up. 
The 
mistakes 
were 
too 
numerous, 
and 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
case 
nuances 
are 
so 
important 
that 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
say 
at 
what 
point 
an 
infelicitous 
rendering 
becomes 
downright 
wrong. 


The 
second 
translator, 
Marianne 
Cowan, 
is 
not 
a 
philosopher 
either. 
Her 
version 
is 
modern 
and 
very 
readable. 
But 
the 
merits 
are 
somewhat 
offset 
by 
errors 
of 
understanding, 
and 
therefore 
I 
have 
pointed 
out 
a 
few 
such 
instances 
in 
my 
notes. 


Often 
it 
seems 
helpful 
to 
call 
the 
reader’s 
attention 
to 
crucial 
passages 
in 
some 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
other 
works. 
These 
are 
cited 
in 
each 
instance 
according 
to 
sections, 
to 
enable 
the 
reader 
to 
find 
them 
in 
any 
edition; 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
material 
included 
in 
a 
volume 
of 
Nietzsche 
translations 
that 
I 
published 
in 
195413 
I 
have 
also 
given 
the 
page 
numbers 
in 
parentheses.

About 
the 
title 
of 
the 
book: 
like 
many 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
titles, 
phrases, 
and 
coinages, 
it 
is 
brilliant, 
unforgettable, 
and 
usually 
misconstrued. 
The 
following 
sections 
of 
the 
book 
are 
relevant 
to 
an 
understanding 
of 
what 
Nietzsche 
meant 
by 
“beyond 
good 
and 
evil”: 
the 
author’s 
Preface 
and 
sections 
2, 
4, 
32, 
33, 
56, 
153, 
164, 
202, 
212, 
the 
end 
of 
241, 
260, 
and 
284. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that 
the 
other 
sections 
are 
not 
relevant 
nor 
that 
the 
reader 
would 
be 
best 
advised 
to 
look 
up 
these 
passages 
first. 
Rather, 
it 
would 
be 
well 
to 
read 
the 
book 
with 
an 
open 
mind 
and 
a 
readiness 
to 
distinguish 
the 
many 
connotations 
of 
its 
striking 
title. 
And 
it 
might 
be 
helpful 
to 
read 
the 
editor’s 
note 
for 
section 
250 
at 
the 
start. 


To 
an 
extent 
at 
least 
it 
may 
help 
many 
readers 
to 
relate 
several 
themes 
of 
the 
book 
to 
other 
great 
writers, 
and 
some 
such 
comparisons 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
notes. 
One 
theme, 
however, 
should 
be 
stated 
here 
at 
the 
outset. 
Ibsen’s 
Dr. 
Thomas 
Stockmann 
says 
at 
the 
end 
of 
An 
Enemy 
of 
the 
People: 
“He 
is 
the 
strongest 
man 
in 
the 
world 
that 
stands 
alone.” 
This 
leitmotif 
of 
the 
play 
illustrates 
Kierkegaard’s 
influence 
on 
Ibsen, 
to 
which 
Georg 
Brandes 
referred 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Nietzsche, 
March 
7, 
1888: 
“Intellectually, 
he 
has 
been 
very 
dependent 
on 
Kierkegaard.” 
We 
may 
recall 
Kierkegaard’s 
remarks 
on 
“That 
Individual”14 
with 
its 
refrain 
“The 
crowd 
is 
untruth.” 
The 
fourth 
act 
of 
Ibsen’s 
play 
could 
almost 
be 
subtitled 
“Variations 
on 
a 
Theme 
by 
Kierkegaard.” 
Witness 
Dr. 
Stockmann’s 
words: 


The 
most 
dangerous 
enemy 
of 
truth 
and 
freedom 
among 
us—is 
the 


compact 
majority. 
Yes, 
the 
damned, 
compact, 
liberal 
majority 
… 


The 
majority 
has 
might—unfortunately—but 
right 
it 
is 
not. 
Right— 


are 
I 
and 
a 
few 
others. 
The 
minority 
is 
always 
right.… 


I 
have 
a 
mind 
to 
make 
a 
revolution 
against 
the 
lie 
that 
the 
majority 
is 


in 
the 
possession 
of 
truth. 
What 
kind 
of 
truths 
are 
those 
around 
which 


the 
majority 
usually 
gathers? 
They 
are 
truths 
that 
have 
become 
so 
old 


that 
they 
are 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
becoming 
shaky. 
But 
once 
a 
truth 
has 


become 
that 
old, 
it 
is 
also 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
becoming 
a 
lie 
… 
A 


normally 
constituted 
truth 
lives, 
let 
us 
say, 
as 
a 
rule 
seventeen 
or 



eighteen 
years; 
at 
most 
twenty, 
rarely 
more. 
But 
such 
aged 
truths 
are 
always 
exceedingly 
thin. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
only 
at 
that 
stage 
that 
the 
majority 
makes 
their 
acquaintance 
… 
All 
these 
majority 
truths 
… 
are 
rather 
like 
rancid, 
spoiled 
… 
hams. 
And 
that 
is 
the 
source 
of 
the 
moral 
scurvy 
that 
rages 
all 
around 
us.…” 


A 
generation 
later, 
Freud 
said 
on 
the 
second 
page 
of 
his 
autobiographical 
Selbstdarstellung 
(Leipzig, 
1925) 
that, 
as 
a 
Jew 
at 
an 
anti-Semitic 
university, 
“I 
learned 
early 
to 
know 
the 
lot 
of 
standing 
in 
opposition 
and 
being 
placed 
under 
a 
ban 
by 
the 
‘compact 
majority.’ 
Thus 
the 
ground 
was 
laid 
for 
a 
certain 
independence 
of 
judgment.” 


One 
reasonable 
perspective 
for 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
is 
to 
see 
it 
somewhere 
between 
Kierkegaard 
and 
Ibsen 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
Freud 
and 
Sartre 
on 
the 
other. 
And 
considering 
how 
much 
Nietzsche 
has 
to 
say 
about 
“nobility” 
in 
this 
book, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
recall 
that 
the 
old 
Freud 
said 
in 
a 
letter 
about 
Nietzsche: 
“In 
my 
youth 
he 
signified 
a 
nobility 
which 
I 
could 
not 
attain.”15 
Such 
sections 
as 
212 
and 
296, 
to 
name 
only 
two 
among 
a 
great 
many, 
invite 
comparison 
with 
some 
of 
the 
phrases 
cited 
here. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
pointless 
to 
attempt 
a 
long 
list, 
for 
what 
is 
at 
stake 
is 
not 
just 
a 
verbal 
similarity 
here 
or 
there 
but 
rather 
one 
way 
of 
seeing 
the 
whole 
book. 
There 
are 
many 
others. 


It 
would 
be 
foolish 
for 
a 
translator, 
and 
even 
for 
a 
commentator, 
to 
attempt 
to 
foist 
his 
own 
estimate 
of 
a 
book 
with 
which 
he 
has 
been 
living 
for 
some 
time 
on 
those 
who 
will 
henceforth 
share 
his 
experience 
to 
some 
extent. 
But 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
Zarathustra’s 
“This 
is 
my 
way; 
where 
is 
yours?”16 
I 
shall 
venture 
a 
suggestion. 


This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
great 
books 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
indeed 
of 
any 
century, 
despite 
much 
with 
which 
the 
modern 
reader 
might 
disagree. 
There 
is 
much 
in 
it 
with 
which 
I 
too 
do 
not 
agree; 
but 
that 
is 
also 
true 
of 
Plato’s 
and 
Aristotle’s 
writings, 
of 
all 
great 
philosophical 
works 
and, 
making 
due 
allowances 
for 
the 
different 
genre, 
of 
Dante’s 
and 
Dostoevsky’s 
ideas 
and 
of 
the 
Bible. 
There 
are 
some 
passages 
that 
strike 
me 
as 
blemishes 
without 
which 
the 
book 
would 
be 
better; 
for 
example, 
the 
tedious 
remarks 
about 
women, 
the 
mercifully 
briefer 
comments 
on 
the 
English, 
and 
the 
poem 
at 
the 
end. 


It 
is 
possible 
to 
say 
briefly 
what 
makes 
the 
book 
great: 
the 
prophetic 
independence 
of 
its 
spirit; 
the 
hundreds 
of 
doors 
it 
opens 
for 
the 
mind, 
revealing 
new 
vistas, 
problems, 
and 
relationships; 
and 
what 
it 
contributes 
to 



our 
understanding 
of 
much 
of 
recent 
thought 
and 
literature 
and 
history. 
Readers 
might 
ask, 
for 
example, 
about 
the 
relation 
of 
various 
passages 
to 
psychoanalysis, 
to 
analytical 
philosophy, 
or 
to 
existentialism. 
But 
even 
a 
far 
longer 
list 
would 
not 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
book. 
There 
remains 
another 
dimension. 
This 
is 
one 
of 
those 
rare 
books 
in 
which 
one 
encounters 
not 
only 
a 
great 
thinker 
but 
also 
a 
fascinating 
human 
being 
of 
exceptional 
complexity 
and 
integrity. 


One 
final 
caution. 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
is 
not 
a 
collection 
of 
aphorisms 
for 
browsing. 
Each 
of 
the 
nine 
major 
parts, 
with 
the 
possible 
exception 
of 
part 
four, 
is 
meant 
to 
be 
read 
straight 
through. 
Each 
pursues 
one 
complex 
of 
problems, 
and 
what 
is 
said 
in 
one 
section 
is 
frequently 
qualified 
decisively 
in 
the 
next, 
or 
a 
few 
pages 
later. 
The 
often 
surprising 
developments 
of 
an 
idea 
constitute 
one 
of 
the 
major 
charms 
of 
this 
work. 
And 
it 
is 
in 
part 
on 
their 
account 
that 
this 
book, 
like 
all 
great 
books—for 
this 
is 
part 
of 
their 
definition 
or, 
as 
Nietzsche 
might 
say, 
a 
criterion 
for 
the 
order 
of 
rank—needs 
to 
be 
read 
more 
than 
once. 
It 
is 
a 
book 
to 
reread 
and 
live 
with.

Preface 


Supposing 
truth 
is 
a 
woman—what 
then? 
Are 
there 
not 
grounds 
for 
the 
suspicion 
that 
all 
philosophers, 
insofar 
as 
they 
were 
dogmatists, 
have 
been 
very 
inexpert 
about 
women? 
That 
the 
gruesome 
seriousness, 
the 
clumsy 
obtrusiveness 
with 
which 
they 
have 
usually 
approached 
truth 
so 
far1 
have 
been 
awkward 
and 
very 
improper 
methods 
for 
winning 
a 
woman’s 
heart? 
What 
is 
certain 
is 
that 
she 
has 
not 
allowed 
herself 
to 
be 
won—and 
today 
every 
kind 
of 
dogmatism 
is 
left 
standing 
dispirited 
and 
discouraged. 
If 
it 
is 
left 
standing 
at 
all! 
For 
there 
are 
scoffers 
who 
claim 
that 
it 
has 
fallen, 
that 
all 
dogmatism 
lies 
on 
the 
ground—even 
more, 
that 
all 
dogmatism 
is 
dying. 


Speaking 
seriously, 
there 
are 
good 
reasons 
why 
all 
philosophical 
dogmatizing, 
however 
solemn 
and 
definitive 
its 
airs 
used 
to 
be, 
may 
nevertheless 
have 
been 
no 
more 
than 
a 
noble 
childishness 
and 
tyronism. 
And 
perhaps 
the 
time 
is 
at 
hand 
when 
it 
will 
be 
comprehended 
again 
and 
again 
how 
little 
used 
to 
be 
sufficient 
to 
furnish 
the 
cornerstone 
for 
such 
sublime 
and 
unconditional 
philosophers’ 
edifices 
as 
the 
dogmatists 
have 
built 
so 
far: 
any 
old 
popular 
superstition 
from 
time 
immemorial 
(like 
the 
soul 
superstition 
which, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
ego 
superstition, 
has 
not 
even 
yet 
ceased 
to 
do 
mischief); 
some 
play 
on 
words 
perhaps, 
a 
seduction 
by 
grammar, 
or 
an 
audacious 
generalization 
of 
very 
narrow, 
very 
personal, 
very 
human, 
all 
too 
human 
facts. 


The 
dogmatists’ 
philosophy 
was, 
let 
us 
hope, 
only 
a 
promise 
across 
millennia—as 
astrology 
was 
in 
still 
earlier 
times 
when 
perhaps 
more 
work, 
money, 
acuteness, 
and 
patience 
were 
lavished 
in 
its 
service 
than 
for 
any 
real 
science 
so 
far: 
to 
astrology 
and 
its 
“supra-terrestrial” 
claims 
we 
owe 
the 
grand 
style 
of 
architecture 
in 
Asia 
and 
Egypt. 
It 
seems 
that 
all 
great 
things 
first 
have 
to 
bestride 
the 
earth 
in 
monstrous 
and 
frightening 
masks 
in 
order 
to 
inscribe 
themselves 
in 
the 
hearts 
of 
humanity 
with 
eternal 
demands: 
dogmatic 
philosophy 
was 
such 
a 
mask; 
for 
example, 
the 
Vedanta 
doctrine 
in 
Asia 
and 
Platonism 
in 
Europe. 



Let 
us 
not 
be 
ungrateful 
to 
it, 
although 
it 
must 
certainly 
be 
conceded 
that 
the 
worst, 
most 
durable, 
and 
most 
dangerous 
of 
all 
errors 
so 
far 
was 
a 
dogmatist’s 
error—namely, 
Plato’s 
invention 
of 
the 
pure 
spirit 
and 
the 
good 
as 
such. 
But 
now 
that 
it 
is 
overcome, 
now 
that 
Europe 
is 
breathing 
freely 
again 
after 
this 
nightmare 
and 
at 
least 
can 
enjoy 
a 
healthier—sleep, 
we, 
whose 
task 
is 
wakefulness 
itself, 
are 
the 
heirs 
of 
all 
that 
strength 
which 
has 
been 
fostered2 
by 
the 
fight 
against 
this 
error. 
To 
be 
sure, 
it 
meant 
standing 
truth 
on 
her 
head 
and 
denying 
perspective, 
the 
basic 
condition 
of 
all 
life, 
when 
one 
spoke 
of 
spirit 
and 
the 
good 
as 
Plato 
did. 
Indeed, 
as 
a 
physician 
one 
might 
ask: 
“How 
could 
the 
most 
beautiful 
growth 
of 
antiquity, 
Plato, 
contract 
such 
a 
disease? 
Did 
the 
wicked 
Socrates 
corrupt 
him 
after 
all? 
Could 
Socrates 
have 
been 
the 
corrupter 
of 
youth 
after 
all? 
And 
did 
he 
deserve 
his 
hemlock?” 


But 
the 
fight 
against 
Plato 
or, 
to 
speak 
more 
clearly 
and 
for 
“the 
people,” 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
Christian-ecclesiastical 
pressure 
of 
millennia—for 
Christianity 
is 
Platonism 
for 
“the 
people”—has 
created 
in 
Europe 
a 
magnificent 
tension 
of 
the 
spirit 
the 
like 
of 
which 
had 
never 
yet 
existed 
on 
earth: 
with 
so 
tense 
a 
bow 
we 
can 
now 
shoot 
for 
the 
most 
distant 
goals. 
To 
be 
sure, 
European 
man 
experiences 
this 
tension 
as 
need 
and 
distress; 
twice 
already 
attempts 
have 
been 
made 
in 
the 
grand 
style 
to 
unbend 
the 
bow—once 
by 
means 
of 
Jesuitism, 
the 
second 
time 
by 
means 
of 
the 
democratic 
enlightenment 
which, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
freedom 
of 
the 
press 
and 
newspaper-
reading, 
might 
indeed 
bring 
it 
about 
that 
the 
spirit 
would 
no 
longer 
experience 
itself 
so 
easily 
as 
a 
“need.” 
(The 
Germans 
have 
invented 
gunpowder—all 
due 
respect 
for 
that!—but 
then 
they 
made 
up 
for 
that: 
they 
invented 
the 
press.)3 
But 
we 
who 
are 
neither 
Jesuits 
nor 
democrats, 
nor 
even 
German 
enough, 
we 
good 
Europeans4 
and 
free, 
very 
free 
spirits—we 
still 
feel 
it, 
the 
whole 
need 
of 
the 
spirit 
and 
the 
whole 
tension 
of 
its 
bow. 
And 
perhaps 
also 
the 
arrow, 
the 
task, 
and—who 
knows?—the 
goal——

Bisher 
(so 
far) 
is 
a 
word 
that 
recurs 
constantly 
throughout 
Beyond 


Good 
and 
Evil. 
It 
helps 
to 
color 
the 
word 
“beyond” 
in 
the 
title.

Grossgezüchtet: 
züchten 
means 
to 
breed, 
grow, 
or 
cultivate 


animals, 
plants, 
or 
qualities. 
Nietzsche 
uses 
the 
word 
frequently, 
and 
in 


these 
pages 
it 
is 
most 
often 
rendered 
by 
“cultivate.” 
In 
his 
usage 
the 



connotation 
is 
generally 
spiritual.

Cf. 
the 
Preface 
to 
The 
Antichrist: 
“One 
must 
be 
skilled 
in 
living 
on 
mountains—seeing 
the 
wretched 
ephemeral 
babble 
of 
politics 
and 
national 
self-seeking 
beneath 
oneself” 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
p. 
568). 
In 
the 
daily 
newspaper 
the 
concern 
with 
ephemeral 
matters 
is 
institutionalized 
and 
cultivated 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
genuine 
“spirituality.”

initially 
introduced 
by 
him 
in

(1878),

(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
61-63).

The

was 
written 
“summer 
1885 
in 
the 
Upper 
Engadine 
and 
the 
following 
winter 
in 
Nizza” 
(letter 
to 
Georg 
Brandes, 
April 
10, 
1888). 
This 
is 
borne 
out 
by 
other 
letters, 
except 
that 
additions 
and 
revisions 
were 
made 
until 
June 
1886. 
The 
book 
was 
printed 
in 
June 
and 
July 
and 
published 
the 
beginning 
of 
August 
1886.

The 
will 
to 
truth 
which 
will 
still 
tempt 
us 
to 
many 
a 
venture, 
that 
famous 
truthfulness 
of 
which 
all 
philosophers 
so 
far 
have 
spoken 
with 
respect—what 
questions 
has 
this 
will 
to 
truth 
not 
laid 
before 
us! 
What 
strange, 
wicked, 
questionable 
questions! 
That 
is 
a 
long 
story 
even 
now—and 
yet 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
it 
had 
scarcely 
begun. 
Is 
it 
any 
wonder 
that 
we 
should 
finally 
become 
suspicious, 
lose 
patience, 
and 
turn 
away 
impatiently? 
that 
we 
should 
finally 
learn 
from 
this 
Sphinx 
to 
ask 
questions, 
too? 
Who 
is 
it 
really 
that 
puts 
questions 
to 
us 
here? 
What 
in 
us 
really 
wants 
“truth”? 


Indeed 
we 
came 
to 
a 
long 
halt 
at 
the 
question 
about 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
will— 
until 
we 
finally 
came 
to 
a 
complete 
stop 
before 
a 
still 
more 
basic 
question. 
We 
asked 
about 
the 
value 
of 
this 
will. 
Suppose 
we 
want 
truth: 
why 
not 
rather 
untruth? 
and 
uncertainty? 
even 
ignorance? 


The 
problem 
of 
the 
value 
of 
truth 
came 
before 
us—or 
was 
it 
we 
who 
came 
before 
the 
problem? 
Who 
of 
us 
is 
Oedipus 
here? 
Who 
the 
Sphinx? 
It 
is 
a 
rendezvous, 
it 
seems, 
of 
questions 
and 
question 
marks. 


And 
though 
it 
scarcely 
seems 
credible, 
it 
finally 
almost 
seems 
to 
us 
as 
if 
the 
problem 
had 
never 
even 
been 
put 
so 
far—as 
if 
we 
were 
the 
first 
to 
see 
it, 
fix 
it 
with 
our 
eyes, 
and 
risk 
it. 
For 
it 
does 
involve 
a 
risk, 
and 
perhaps 
there 
is 
none 
that 
is 
greater.

“How 
could 
anything 
originate 
out 
of 
its 
opposite? 
for 
example, 
truth 
out 
of 
error? 
or 
the 
will 
to 
truth 
out 
of 
the 
will 
to 
deception? 
or 
selfless 
deeds 
out 
of 
selfishness? 
or 
the 
pure 
and 
sunlike 
gaze 
of 
the 
sage 
out 
of 
lust? 
Such 
origins 
are 
impossible; 
whoever 
dreams 
of 
them 
is 
a 
fool, 
indeed 
worse; 
the 
things 
of 
the 
highest 
value 
must 
have 
another, 
peculiar 
origin—they 
cannot 
be 
derived 
from 
this 
transitory, 
seductive, 
deceptive, 
paltry 
world, 
from 
this 
turmoil 
of 
delusion 
and 
lust. 
Rather 
from 
the 
lap 
of 
Being, 
the 
intransitory, 
the 
hidden 
god, 
the 
‘thing-in-itself’—there 
must 
be 
their 
basis, 
and 
nowhere 
else.” 


This 
way 
of 
judging 
constitutes 
the 
typical 
prejudgment 
and 
prejudice 
which 
give 
away 
the 
metaphysicians 
of 
all 
ages; 
this 
kind 
of 
valuation 
looms 
in 
the 
background 
of 
all 
their 
logical 
procedures; 
it 
is 
on 
account 
of 
this 
“faith” 
that 
they 
trouble 
themselves 
about 
“knowledge,” 
about 
something 
that 
is 
finally 
baptized 
solemnly 
as 
“the 
truth.” 
The 
fundamental 
faith 
of 
the 
metaphysicians 
is 
the 
faith 
in 
opposite 
values.2 
It 
has 
not 
even 
occurred 
to 
the 
most 
cautious 
among 
them 
that 
one 
might 
have 
a 
doubt 
right 
here 
at 
the 
threshold 
where 
it 
was 
surely 
most 
necessary—even 
if 
they 
vowed 
to 
themselves, 
“de 
omnibus 
dubitandum.”3 
For 
one 
may 
doubt, 
first, 
whether 
there 
are 
any 
opposites 
at 
all, 
and 
secondly 
whether 
these 
popular 
valuations 
and 
opposite 
values 
on 
which 
the 
metaphysicians 
put 
their 
seal, 
are 
not 
perhaps 
merely 
foreground 
estimates, 
only 
provisional 
perspectives, 
perhaps 
even 
from 
some 
nook, 
perhaps 
from 
below, 
frog 
perspectives, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
borrow 
an 
expression 
painters 
use. 
For 
all 
the 
value 
that 
the 
true, 
the 
truthful, 
the 
selfless 
may 
deserve, 
it 
would 
still 
be 
possible 
that 
a 
higher 
and 
more 
fundamental 
value 
for 
life 
might 
have 
to 
be 
ascribed 
to 
deception, 
selfishness, 
and 
lust. 
It 
might 
even 
be 
possible 
that 
what 
constitutes 
the 
value 
of 
these 
good 
and 
revered 
things 
is 
precisely 
that 
they 
are 
insidiously 
related, 
tied 
to, 
and 
involved 
with 
these 
wicked, 
seemingly 
opposite 
things—maybe 
even 
one 
with 
them 
in 
essence. 
Maybe! 


But 
who 
has 
the 
will 
to 
concern 
himself 
with 
such 
dangerous 
maybes? 
For 
that, 
one 
really 
has 
to 
wait 
for 
the 
advent 
of 
a 
new 
species 
of 
philosophers, 



such 
as 
have 
somehow 
another 
and 
converse 
taste 
and 
propensity 
from 
those 
we 
have 
known 
so 
far—philosophers 
of 
the 
dangerous 
“maybe” 
in 
every 
sense. 


And 
in 
all 
seriousness: 
I 
see 
such 
new 
philosophers 
coming 
up. 



3 


After 
having 
looked 
long 
enough 
between 
the 
philosopher’s 
lines 
and 
fingers, 
I 
say 
to 
myself: 
by 
far 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
conscious 
thinking 
must 
still 
be 
included 
among 
instinctive 
activities, 
and 
that 
goes 
even 
for 
philosophical 
thinking. 
We 
have 
to 
relearn 
here, 
as 
one 
has 
had 
to 
relearn 
about 
heredity 
and 
what 
is 
“innate.” 
As 
the 
act 
of 
birth 
deserves 
no 
consideration 
in 
the 
whole 
process 
and 
procedure 
of 
heredity, 
so 
“being 
conscious” 
is 
not 
in 
any 
decisive 
sense 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
is 
instinctive: 
most 
of 
the 
conscious 
thinking 
of 
a 
philosopher 
is 
secretly 
guided 
and 
forced 
into 
certain 
channels 
by 
his 
instincts. 


Behind 
all 
logic 
and 
its 
seeming 
sovereignty 
of 
movement, 
too, 
there 
stand 
valuations 
or, 
more 
clearly, 
physiological 
demands 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
a 
certain 
type 
of 
life. 
For 
example, 
that 
the 
definite 
should 
be 
worth 
more 
than 
the 
indefinite, 
and 
mere 
appearance 
worth 
less 
than 
“truth”—such 
estimates 
might 
be, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
regulative 
importance 
for 
us, 
nevertheless 
mere 
foreground 
estimates, 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
niaiserie4 
which 
may 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
just 
such 
beings 
as 
we 
are. 
Supposing, 
that 
is, 
that 
not 
just 
man 
is 
the 
“measure 
of 
things”5— 



4 


The 
falseness 
of 
a 
judgment 
is 
for 
us 
not 
necessarily 
an 
objection 
to 
a 
judgment; 
in 
this 
respect 
our 
new 
language 
may 
sound 
strangest. 
The 
question 
is 
to 
what 
extent 
it 
is 
life-promoting, 
life-preserving, 
species-
preserving, 
perhaps 
even 
species-cultivating. 
And 
we 
are 
fundamentally 
inclined 
to 
claim 
that 
the 
falsest 
judgments 
(which 
include 
the 
synthetic 
judgments 
a 
priori)6 
are 
the 
most 
indispensable 
for 
us; 
that 
without 
accepting 
the 
fictions 
of 
logic, 
without 
measuring 
reality 
against 
the 
purely 
invented 
world 
of 
the 
unconditional 
and 
self-identical, 
without 
a 
constant 
falsification 
of 
the 
world 
by 
means 
of 
numbers, 
man 
could 
not 
live—that 
renouncing 
false 
judgments 
would 
mean 
renouncing 
life 
and 
a 
denial 
of 
life. 
To 
recognize 
untruth 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
life—that 
certainly 
means 
resisting 
accustomed 
value 
feelings 
in 
a 
dangerous 
way; 
and 
a 
philosophy 
that 
risks 
this 
would 
by 
that 
token 
alone 
place 
itself 
beyond 
good 
and 
evil. 



5 


What 
provokes 
one 
to 
look 
at 
all 
philosophers 
half 
suspiciously, 
half 
mockingly, 
is 
not 
that 
one 
discovers 
again 
and 
again 
how 
innocent 
they 
are— 
how 
often 
and 
how 
easily 
they 
make 
mistakes 
and 
go 
astray; 
in 
short, 
their 
childishness 
and 
childlikeness—but 
that 
they 
are 
not 
honest 
enough 
in 
their 
work, 
although 
they 
all 
make 
a 
lot 
of 
virtuous 
noise 
when 
the 
problem 
of 
truthfulness 
is 
touched 
even 
remotely. 
They 
all 
pose 
as 
if 
they 
had 
discovered 
and 
reached 
their 
real 
opinions 
through 
the 
self-development 
of 
a 
cold, 
pure, 
divinely 
unconcerned 
dialectic 
(as 
opposed 
to 
the 
mystics 
of 
every 
rank, 
who 
are 
more 
honest 
and 
doltish—and 
talk 
of 
“inspiration”); 
while 
at 
bottom 
it 
is 
an 
assumption, 
a 
hunch, 
indeed 
a 
kind 
of 
“inspiration”—most 
often 
a 
desire 
of 
the 
heart 
that 
has 
been 
filtered 
and 
made 
abstract—that 
they 
defend 
with 
reasons 
they 
have 
sought 
after 
the 
fact. 
They 
are 
all 
advocates 
who 
resent 
that 
name, 
and 
for 
the 
most 
part 
even 
wily 
spokesmen 
for 
their 
prejudices 
which 
they 
baptize 
“truths”—and 
very 
far 
from 
having 
the 
courage 
of 
the 
conscience 
that 
admits 
this, 
precisely 
this, 
to 
itself; 
very 
far 
from 
having 
the 
good 
taste 
of 
the 
courage 
which 
also 
lets 
this 
be 
known, 
whether 
to 
warn 
an 
enemy 
or 
friend, 
or, 
from 
exuberance, 
to 
mock 
itself. 


The 
equally 
stiff 
and 
decorous 
Tartuffery 
of 
the 
old 
Kant 
as 
he 
lures 
us 
on 
the 
dialectical 
bypaths 
that 
lead 
to 
his 
“categorical 
imperative”—really 
lead 
astray 
and 
seduce—this 
spectacle 
makes 
us 
smile, 
as 
we 
are 
fastidious 
and 
find 
it 
quite 
amusing 
to 
watch 
closely 
the 
subtle 
tricks 
of 
old 
moralists 
and 
preachers 
of 
morals. 
Or 
consider 
the 
hocus-pocus 
of 
mathematical 
form 
with 
which 
Spinoza 
clad 
his 
philosophy—really 
“the 
love 
of 
his 
wisdom,” 
to 
render 
that 
word 
fairly 
and 
squarely—in 
mail 
and 
mask, 
to 
strike 
terror 
at 
the 
very 
outset 
into 
the 
heart 
of 
any 
assailant 
who 
should 
dare 
to 
glance 
at 
that 
invincible 
maiden 
and 
Pallas 
Athena: 
how 
much 
personal 
timidity 
and 
vulnerability 
this 
masquerade 
of 
a 
sick 
hermit 
betrays! 



6 


Gradually 
it 
has 
become 
clear 
to 
me 
what 
every 
great 
philosophy 
so 
far 
has 
been: 
namely, 
the 
personal 
confession 
of 
its 
author 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
involuntary 
and 
unconscious 
memoir; 
also 
that 
the 
moral 
(or 
immoral) 
intentions 
in 
every 
philosophy 
constituted 
the 
real 
germ 
of 
life 
from 
which 
the 
whole 
plant 
had 
grown. 


Indeed, 
if 
one 
would 
explain 
how 
the 
abstrusest 
metaphysical 
claims 
of 
a 
philosopher 
really 
came 
about, 
it 
is 
always 
well 
(and 
wise) 
to 
ask 
first: 
at 
what 
morality 
does 
all 
this 
(does 
he) 
aim? 
Accordingly, 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
a 
“drive 
to 
knowledge” 
is 
the 
father 
of 
philosophy; 
but 
rather 
that 
another 
drive 
has, 
here 
as 
elsewhere, 
employed 
understanding 
(and 
misunderstanding) 
as 
a 
mere 
instrument. 
But 
anyone 
who 
considers 
the 
basic 
drives 
of 
man 
to 
see 
to 
what 
extent 
they 
may 
have 
been 
at 
play 
just 
here 
as 
inspiring 
spirits 
(or 
demons 
and 
kobolds) 
will 
find 
that 
all 
of 
them 
have 
done 
philosophy 
at 
some 
time—and 
that 
every 
single 
one 
of 
them 
would 
like 
only 
too 
well 
to 
represent 
just 
itself 
as 
the 
ultimate 
purpose 
of 
existence 
and 
the 
legitimate 
master 
of 
all 
the 
other 
drives. 
For 
every 
drive 
wants 
to 
be 
master—and 
it 
attempts 
to 
philosophize 
in 
that 
spirit. 


To 
be 
sure: 
among 
scholars 
who 
are 
really 
scientific 
men, 
things 
may 
be 
different—”better,” 
if 
you 
like—there 
you 
may 
really 
find 
something 
like 
a 
drive 
for 
knowledge, 
some 
small, 
independent 
clockwork 
that, 
once 
well 
wound, 
works 
on 
vigorously 
without 
any 
essential 
participation 
from 
all 
the 
other 
drives 
of 
the 
scholar. 
The 
real 
“interests” 
of 
the 
scholar 
therefore 
lie 
usually 
somewhere 
else—say, 
in 
his 
family, 
or 
in 
making 
money, 
or 
in 
politics. 
Indeed, 
it 
is 
almost 
a 
matter 
of 
total 
indifference 
whether 
his 
little 
machine 
is 
placed 
at 
this 
or 
that 
spot 
in 
science, 
and 
whether 
the 
“promising” 
young 
worker 
turns 
himself 
into 
a 
good 
philologist 
or 
an 
expert 
on 
fungi 
or 
a 
chemist: 
it 
does 
not 
characterize 
him 
that 
he 
becomes 
this 
or 
that. 
In 
the 
philosopher, 
conversely, 
there 
is 
nothing 
whatever 
that 
is 
impersonal;7 
and 
above 
all, 
his 
morality 
bears 
decided 
and 
decisive 
witness 
to 
who 
he 
is—that 
is, 
in 
what 
order 
of 
rank 
the 
innermost 
drives 
of 
his 
nature 
stand 
in 
relation 
to 
each 
other.

How 
malicious 
philosophers 
can 
be! 
I 
know 
of 
nothing 
more 
venomous 
than 
the 
joke 
Epicurus 
permitted 
himself 
against 
Plato 
and 
the 
Platonists; 
he 
called 
them 
Dionysiokolakes. 
That 
means 
literally—and 
this 
is 
the 
foreground 
meaning—”flatterers 
of 
Dionysius,” 
in 
other 
words, 
tyrant’s 
baggage 
and 
lickspittles; 
but 
in 
addition 
to 
this 
he 
also 
wants 
to 
say, 
“they 
are 
all 
actors, 
there 
is 
nothing 
genuine 
about 
them” 
(for 
Dionysokolax 
was 
a 
popular 
name 
for 
an 
actor).8 
And 
the 
latter 
is 
really 
the 
malice 
that 
Epicurus 
aimed 
at 
Plato: 
he 
was 
peeved 
by 
the 
grandiose 
manner, 
the 
mise 
en 
scène9 
at 
which 
Plato 
and 
his 
disciples 
were 
so 
expert—at 
which 
Epicurus 
was 
not 
an 
expert—he, 
that 
old 
schoolmaster 
from 
Samos, 
who 
sat, 
hidden 
away, 
in 
his 
little 
garden 
at 
Athens 
and 
wrote 
three 
hundred 
books—who 
knows? 
perhaps 
from 
rage 
and 
ambition 
against 
Plato? 


It 
took 
a 
hundred 
years 
until 
Greece 
found 
out 
who 
this 
garden 
god, 
Epicurus, 
had 
been.— 
Did 
they 
find 
out?— 



8 


There 
is 
a 
point 
in 
every 
philosophy 
when 
the 
philosopher’s 
“conviction” 
appears 
on 
the 
stage—or 
to 
use 
the 
language 
of 
an 
ancient 
Mystery: 
Adventavit 
asinus, 


10 


Pulcher 
et 
fortissimus.

“According 
to 
nature” 
you 
want 
to 
live? 
O 
you 
noble 
Stoics, 
what 
deceptive 
words 
these 
are! 
Imagine 
a 
being 
like 
nature, 
wasteful 
beyond 
measure, 
indifferent 
beyond 
measure, 
without 
purposes 
and 
consideration, 
without 
mercy 
and 
justice, 
fertile 
and 
desolate 
and 
uncertain 
at 
the 
same 
time; 
imagine 
indifference 
itself 
as 
a 
power—how 
could 
you 
live 
according 
to 
this 
indifference? 
Living—is 
that 
not 
precisely 
wanting 
to 
be 
other 
than 
this 
nature? 
Is 
not 
living—estimating, 
preferring, 
being 
unjust, 
being 
limited, 
wanting 
to 
be 
different? 
And 
supposing 
your 
imperative 
“live 
according 
to 
nature” 
meant 
at 
bottom 
as 
much 
as 
“live 
according 
to 
life”—how 
could 
you 
not 
do 
that? 
Why 
make 
a 
principle 
of 
what 
you 
yourselves 
are 
and 
must 
be? 


In 
truth, 
the 
matter 
is 
altogether 
different: 
while 
you 
pretend 
rapturously 
to 
read 
the 
canon 
of 
your 
law 
in 
nature, 
you 
want 
something 
opposite, 
you 
strange 
actors 
and 
self-deceivers! 
Your 
pride 
wants 
to 
impose 
your 
morality, 
your 
ideal, 
on 
nature—even 
on 
nature—and 
incorporate 
them 
in 
her; 
you 
demand 
that 
she 
should 
be 
nature 
“according 
to 
the 
Stoa,” 
and 
you 
would 
like 
all 
existence 
to 
exist 
only 
after 
your 
own 
image—as 
an 
immense 
eternal 
glorification 
and 
generalization 
of 
Stoicism. 
For 
all 
your 
love 
of 
truth, 
you 
have 
forced 
yourselves 
so 
long, 
so 
persistently, 
so 
rigidly-hypnotically 
to 
see 
nature 
the 
wrong 
way, 
namely 
Stoically, 
that 
you 
are 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
see 
her 
differently. 
And 
some 
abysmal 
arrogance 
finally 
still 
inspires 
you 
with 
the 
insane 
hope 
that 
because 
you 
know 
how 
to 
tyrannize 
yourselves— 
Stoicism 
is 
self-tyranny—nature, 
too, 
lets 
herself 
be 
tyrannized: 
is 
not 
the 
Stoic—a 
piece 
of 
nature? 


But 
this 
is 
an 
ancient, 
eternal 
story: 
what 
formerly 
happened 
with 
the 
Stoics 
still 
happens 
today, 
too, 
as 
soon 
as 
any 
philosophy 
begins 
to 
believe 
in 
itself. 
It 
always 
creates 
the 
world 
in 
its 
own 
image; 
it 
cannot 
do 
otherwise. 
Philosophy 
is 
this 
tyrannical 
drive 
itself, 
the 
most 
spiritual 
will 
to 
power, 
to 
the 
“creation 
of 
the 
world,” 
to 
the 
causa 
prima.11 



10 


The 
eagerness 
and 
subtlety—I 
might 
even 
say, 
shrewdness—with 
which 
the 
problem 
of 
“the 
real 
and 
the 
apparent 
world” 
is 
today 
attacked 
all 
over 
Europe 
makes 
one 
think 
and 
wonder; 
and 
anyone 
who 
hears 
nothing 
in 
the 
background 
except 
a 
“will 
to 
truth,” 
certainly 
does 
not 
have 
the 
best 
of 
ears. 
In 
rare 
and 
isolated 
instances 
it 
may 
really 
be 
the 
case 
that 
such 
a 
will 
to 
truth, 
some 
extravagant 
and 
adventurous 
courage, 
a 
metaphysician’s 
ambition 
to 
hold 
a 
hopeless 
position, 
may 
participate 
and 
ultimately 
prefer 
even 
a 
handful 
of 
“certainty” 
to 
a 
whole 
carload 
of 
beautiful 
possibilities; 
there 
may 
actually 
be 
puritanical 
fanatics 
of 
conscience, 
who 
prefer 
even 
a 
certain 
nothing 
to 
an 
uncertain 
something 
to 
lie 
down 
on—and 
die. 
But 
this 
is 
nihilism 
and 
the 
sign 
of 
a 
despairing, 
mortally 
weary 
soul—however 
courageous 
the 
gestures 
of 
such 
a 
virtue 
may 
look. 


It 
seems, 
however, 
to 
be 
otherwise 
with 
stronger 
and 
livelier 
thinkers 
who 
are 
still 
eager 
for 
life. 
When 
they 
side 
against 
appearance, 
and 
speak 
of 
“perspective,” 
with 
a 
new 
arrogance; 
when 
they 
rank 
the 
credibility 
of 
their 
own 
bodies 
about 
as 
low 
as 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
visual 
evidence 
that 
“the 
earth 
stands 
still,” 
and 
thus, 
apparently 
in 
good 
humor, 
let 
their 
securest 
possession 
go 
(for 
in 
what 
does 
one 
at 
present 
believe 
more 
firmly 
than 
in 
one’s 
body?)—who 
knows 
if 
they 
are 
not 
trying 
at 
bottom 
to 
win 
back 
something 
that 
was 
formerly 
an 
even 
securer 
possession, 
something 
of 
the 
ancient 
domain 
of 
the 
faith 
of 
former 
times, 
perhaps 
the 
“immortal 
soul,” 
perhaps 
“the 
old 
God,” 
in 
short, 
ideas 
by 
which 
one 
could 
live 
better, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
more 
vigorously 
and 
cheerfully, 
than 
by 
“modern 
ideas”? 
There 
is 
mistrust 
of 
these 
modern 
ideas 
in 
this 
attitude, 
a 
disbelief 
in 
all 
that 
has 
been 
constructed 
yesterday 
and 
today; 
there 
is 
perhaps 
some 
slight 
admixture 
of 
satiety 
and 
scorn, 
unable 
to 
endure 
any 
longer 
the 
bric-a-brac 
of 
concepts 
of 
the 
most 
diverse 
origin, 
which 
is 
the 
form 
in 
which 
so-called 
positivism 
offers 
itself 
on 
the 
market 
today; 
a 
disgust 
of 
the 
more 
fastidious 
taste 
at 
the 
village-fair 
motleyness 
and 
patchiness 
of 
all 
these 
reality-philosophasters 
in 
whom 
there 
is 
nothing 
new 
or 
genuine, 
except 
this 
motleyness. 
In 
this, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
we 
should 
agree 
with 
these 
skeptical 
anti-realists 
and 
knowledge-microscopists 
of 
today: 
their 
instinct, 
which 
repels 
them 
from 



modern 
reality, 
is 
unrefuted—what 
do 
their 
retrograde 
bypaths 
concern 
us! 
The 
main 
thing 
about 
them 
is 
not 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
go 
“back,” 
but 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
get—away. 
A 
little 
more 
strength, 
flight, 
courage, 
and 
artistic 
power, 
and 
they 
would 
want 
to 
rise—not 
return! 



11 


It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
today 
attempts 
are 
made 
everywhere 
to 
divert 
attention 
from 
the 
actual 
influence 
Kant 
exerted 
on 
German 
philosophy, 
and 
especially 
to 
ignore 
prudently 
the 
value 
he 
set 
upon 
himself. 
Kant 
was 
first 
and 
foremost 
proud 
of 
his 
table 
of 
categories; 
with 
that 
in 
his 
hand 
he 
said: 
“This 
is 
the 
most 
difficult 
thing 
that 
could 
ever 
be 
undertaken 
on 
behalf 
of 
metaphysics.” 


Let 
us 
only 
understand 
this 
“could 
be”! 
He 
was 
proud 
of 
having 
discovered 
a 
new 
faculty 
in 
man, 
the 
faculty 
for 
synthetic 
judgments, 
a 
priori. 
Suppose 
he 
deceived 
himself 
in 
this 
matter; 
the 
development 
and 
rapid 
flourishing 
of 
German 
philosophy 
depended 
nevertheless 
on 
his 
pride, 
and 
on 
the 
eager 
rivalry 
of 
the 
younger 
generation 
to 
discover, 
if 
possible, 
something 
still 
prouder—at 
all 
events 
“new 
faculties”! 


But 
let 
us 
reflect; 
it 
is 
high 
time 
to 
do 
so. 
“How 
are 
synthetic 
judgments 
a 
priori 
possible?” 
Kant 
asked 
himself—and 
what 
really 
is 
his 
answer? 
“By 
virtue 
of 
a 
faculty”12—but 
unfortunately 
not 
in 
five 
words, 
but 
so 
circumstantially, 
venerably, 
and 
with 
such 
a 
display 
of 
German 
profundity 
and 
curlicues 
that 
people 
simply 
failed 
to 
note 
the 
comical 
niaiserie 
allemande13 
involved 
in 
such 
an 
answer. 
People 
were 
actually 
beside 
themselves 
with 
delight 
over 
this 
new 
faculty, 
and 
the 
jubilation 
reached 
its 
climax 
when 
Kant 
further 
discovered 
a 
moral 
faculty 
in 
man—for 
at 
that 
time 
the 
Germans 
were 
still 
moral 
and 
not 
yet 
addicted 
to 
Realpolitik. 


The 
honeymoon 
of 
German 
philosophy 
arrived. 
All 
the 
young 
theologians 
of 
the 
Tübingen 
seminary 
went 
into 
the 
bushes—all 
looking 
for 
“faculties.” 
And 
what 
did 
they 
not 
find—in 
that 
innocent, 
rich, 
and 
still 
youthful 
period 
of 
the 
German 
spirit, 
to 
which 
romanticism, 
the 
malignant 
fairy, 
piped 
and 
sang, 
when 
one 
could 
not 
yet 
distinguish 
between 
“finding” 
and 
“inventing”!14 
Above 
all, 
a 
faculty 
for 
the 
“surprasensible”: 
Schelling 
christened 
it 
intellectual 
intuition, 
and 
thus 
gratified 
the 
most 
heartfelt 
cravings 
of 
the 
Germans, 
whose 
cravings 
were 
at 
bottom 
pious. 
One 
can 
do 
no 
greater 
wrong 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
this 
exuberant 
and 
enthusiastic 
movement, 
which 
was 
really 
youthfulness, 
however 
boldly 
it 
disguised 
itself 
in 
hoary 



and 
senile 
concepts, 
than 
to 
take 
it 
seriously, 
or 
worse, 
to 
treat 
it 
with 
moral 
indignation. 
Enough, 
one 
grew 
older 
and 
the 
dream 
vanished. 
A 
time 
came 
when 
people 
scratched 
their 
heads, 
and 
they 
still 
scratch 
them 
today. 
One 
had 
been 
dreaming, 
and 
first 
and 
foremost—old 
Kant. 
“By 
virtue 
of 
a 
faculty”— 
he 
had 
said, 
or 
at 
least 
meant. 
But 
is 
that—an 
answer? 
An 
explanation? 
Or 
is 
it 
not 
rather 
merely 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
question? 
How 
does 
opium 
induce 
sleep? 
“By 
virtue 
of 
a 
faculty,” 
namely 
the 
virtus 
dormitiva, 
replies 
the 
doctor 
in 
Molière, 


Quia 
est 
in 
eo 
virtus 
dormitiva, 
Cujus 
est 
natura 
sensus 
assoupire.15 


But 
such 
replies 
belong 
in 
comedy, 
and 
it 
is 
high 
time 
to 
replace 
the 
Kantian 
question, 
“How 
are 
synthetic 
judgments 
a 
priori 
possible?” 
by 
another 
question, 
“Why 
is 
belief 
in 
such 
judgments 
necessary?”—and 
to 
comprehend 
that 
such 
judgments 
must 
be 
believed 
to 
be 
true, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
preservation 
of 
creatures 
like 
ourselves; 
though 
they 
might, 
of 
course, 
be 
false 
judgments 
for 
all 
that! 
Or 
to 
speak 
more 
clearly 
and 
coarsely: 
synthetic 
judgments 
a 
priori 
should 
not 
“be 
possible” 
at 
all; 
we 
have 
no 
right 
to 
them; 
in 
our 
mouths 
they 
are 
nothing 
but 
false 
judgments. 
Only, 
of 
course, 
the 
belief 
in 
their 
truth 
is 
necessary, 
as 
a 
foreground 
belief 
and 
visual 
evidence 
belonging 
to 
the 
perspective 
optics 
of 
life. 


Finally, 
to 
call 
to 
mind 
the 
enormous 
influence 
that 
“German 
philosophy”—I 
hope 
you 
understand 
its 
right 
to 
quotation 
marks—has 
exercised 
throughout 
the 
whole 
of 
Europe, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
a 
certain 
virtus 
dormitiva 
had 
a 
share 
in 
it: 
it 
was 
a 
delight 
to 
the 
noble 
idlers, 
the 
virtuous, 
the 
mystics, 
artists, 
three-quarter 
Christians, 
and 
political 
obscurantists 
of 
all 
nations, 
to 
find, 
thanks 
to 
German 
philosophy, 
an 
antidote 
to 
the 
still 
predominant 
sensualism 
which 
overflowed 
from 
the 
last 
century 
into 
this, 
in 
short—“sensus 
assoupire.” 



12 


As 
for 
materialistic 
atomism, 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
best 
refuted 
theories 
there 
are, 
and 
in 
Europe 
perhaps 
no 
one 
in 
the 
learned 
world 
is 
now 
so 
unscholarly 
as 
to 
attach 
serious 
significance 
to 
it, 
except 
for 
convenient 
household 
use 
(as 
an 
abbreviation 
of 
the 
means 
of 
expression)—thanks 
chiefly 
to 
the 
Dalmatian 
Boscovich: 
he 
and 
the 
Pole 
Corpernicus 
have 
been 
the 
greatest 
and 
most 
successful 
opponents 
of 
visual 
evidence 
so 
far. 
For 
while 
Copernicus 
has 
persuaded 
us 
to 
believe, 
contrary 
to 
all 
the 
senses, 
that 
the 
earth 
does 
not 
stand 
fast, 
Boscovich 
has 
taught 
us 
to 
abjure 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
last 
part 
of 
the 
earth 
that 
“stood 
fast”—the 
belief 
in 
“substance,” 
in 
“matter,” 
in 
the 
earth-
residuum 
and 
particle-atom:16 
it 
is 
the 
greatest 
triumph 
over 
the 
senses 
that 
has 
been 
gained 
on 
earth 
so 
far. 


One 
must, 
however, 
go 
still 
further, 
and 
also 
declare 
war, 
relentless 
war 
unto 
death, 
against 
the 
“atomistic 
need” 
which 
still 
leads 
a 
dangerous 
afterlife 
in 
places 
where 
no 
one 
suspects 
it, 
just 
like 
the 
more 
celebrated 
“metaphysical 
need”: 
one 
must 
also, 
first 
of 
all, 
give 
the 
finishing 
stroke 
to 
that 
other 
and 
more 
calamitous 
atomism 
which 
Christianity 
has 
taught 
best 
and 
longest, 
the 
soul 
atomism. 
Let 
it 
be 
permitted 
to 
designate 
by 
this 
expression 
the 
belief 
which 
regards 
the 
soul 
as 
something 
indestructible, 
eternal, 
indivisible, 
as 
a 
monad, 
as 
an 
atomon: 
this 
belief 
ought 
to 
be 
expelled 
from 
science! 
Between 
ourselves, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
necessary 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
“the 
soul” 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
thus 
to 
renounce 
one 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
and 
venerable 
hypotheses—as 
happens 
frequently 
to 
clumsy 
naturalists 
who 
can 
hardly 
touch 
on 
“the 
soul” 
without 
immediately 
losing 
it. 
But 
the 
way 
is 
open 
for 
new 
versions 
and 
refinements 
of 
the 
soul-hypothesis; 
and 
such 
conceptions 
as 
“mortal 
soul,” 
and 
“soul 
as 
subjective 
multiplicity,” 
and 
“soul 
as 
social 
structure 
of 
the 
drives 
and 
affects,”17 
want 
henceforth 
to 
have 
citizens’ 
rights 
in 
science. 
When 
the 
new 
psychologist 
puts 
an 
end 
to 
the 
superstitions 
which 
have 
so 
far 
flourished 
with 
almost 
tropical 
luxuriance 
around 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
soul, 
he 
practically 
exiles 
himself 
into 
a 
new 
desert 
and 
a 
new 
suspicion—it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
older 
psychologists 
had 
a 
merrier 
and 
more 
comfortable 
time 
of 
it; 
eventually, 
however, 
he 
finds 
that 
precisely 



thereby 
he 
also 
condemns 
himself 
to 
invention—and—who 
knows?—perhaps 
to 
discovery. 



13 


Physiologists 
should 
think 
before 
putting 
down 
the 
instinct 
of 
self-
preservation 
as 
the 
cardinal 
instinct 
of 
an 
organic 
being. 
A 
living 
thing 
seeks 
above 
all 
to 
discharge 
its 
strength—life 
itself 
is 
will 
to 
power; 
self-
preservation 
is 
only 
one 
of 
the 
indirect 
and 
most 
frequent 
results. 


In 
short, 
here 
as 
everywhere 
else, 
let 
us 
beware 
of 
superfluous 
teleological 
principles—one 
of 
which 
is 
the 
instinct 
of 
self-preservation 
(we 
owe 
it 
to 
Spinoza’s 
inconsistency).18 
Thus 
method, 
which 
must 
be 
essentially 
economy 
of 
principles, 
demands 
it. 



14 


It 
is 
perhaps 
just 
dawning 
on 
five 
or 
six 
minds 
that 
physics, 
too, 
is 
only 
an 
interpretation 
and 
exegesis 
of 
the 
world 
(to 
suit 
us, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so!) 
and 
not 
a 
world-explanation; 
but 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
based 
on 
belief 
in 
the 
senses, 
it 
is 
regarded 
as 
more, 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
to 
come 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
more— 
namely, 
as 
an 
explanation. 
Eyes 
and 
fingers 
speak 
in 
its 
favor, 
visual 
evidence 
and 
palpableness 
do, 
too: 
this 
strikes 
an 
age 
with 
fundamentally 
plebeian 
tastes 
as 
fascinating, 
persuasive, 
and 
convincing—after 
all, 
it 
follows 
instinctively 
the 
canon 
of 
truth 
of 
eternally 
popular 
sensualism. 
What 
is 
clear, 
what 
is 
“explained”? 
Only 
what 
can 
be 
seen 
and 
felt—every 
problem 
has 
to 
be 
pursued 
to 
that 
point. 
Conversely, 
the 
charm 
of 
the 
Platonic 
way 
of 
thinking, 
which 
was 
a 
noble 
way 
of 
thinking, 
consisted 
precisely 
in 
resistance 
to 
obvious 
sense-evidence—perhaps 
among 
men 
who 
enjoyed 
even 
stronger 
and 
more 
demanding 
senses 
than 
our 
contemporaries, 
but 
who 
knew 
how 
to 
find 
a 
higher 
triumph 
in 
remaining 
masters 
of 
their 
senses—and 
this 
by 
means 
of 
pale, 
cold, 
gray 
concept 
nets 
which 
they 
threw 
over 
the 
motley 
whirl 
of 
the 
senses—the 
mob 
of 
the 
senses, 
as 
Plato 
said. 
In 
this 
overcoming 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
interpreting 
of 
the 
world 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
Plato, 
there 
was 
an 
enjoyment 
different 
from 
that 
which 
the 
physicists 
of 
today 
offer 
us—and 
also 
the 
Darwinists 
and 
anti-teleologists 
among 
the 
workers 
in 
physiology, 
with 
their 
principle 
of 
the 
“smallest 
possible 
force” 
and 
the 
greatest 
possible 
stupidity. 
“Where 
man 
cannot 
find 
anything 
to 
see 
or 
to 
grasp, 
he 
has 
no 
further 
business”—that 
is 
certainly 
an 
imperative 
different 
from 
the 
Platonic 
one, 
but 
it 
may 
be 
the 
right 
imperative 
for 
a 
tough, 
industrious 
race 
of 
machinists 
and 
bridge-builders 
of 
the 
future, 
who 
have 
nothing 
but 
rough 
work 
to 
do. 



15 


To 
study 
physiology 
with 
a 
clear 
conscience, 
one 
must 
insist 
that 
the 
sense 
organs 
are 
not 
phenomena 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
idealistic 
philosophy; 
as 
such 
they 
could 
not 
be 
causes! 
Sensualism, 
therefore, 
at 
least 
as 
a 
regulative 
hypothesis, 
if 
not 
as 
a 
heuristic 
principle. 


What? 
And 
others 
even 
say 
that 
the 
external 
world 
is 
the 
work 
of 
our 
organs? 
But 
then 
our 
body, 
as 
a 
part 
of 
this 
external 
world, 
would 
be 
the 
work 
of 
our 
organs! 
But 
then 
our 
organs 
themselves 
would 
be—the 
work 
of 
our 
organs! 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
is 
a 
complete 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum,19 
assuming 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
causa 
sui20 
is 
something 
fundamentally 
absurd. 
Consequently, 
the 
external 
world 
is 
not 
the 
work 
of 
our 
organs—? 



16 


There 
are 
still 
harmless 
self-observers 
who 
believe 
that 
there 
are 
“immediate 
certainties”; 
for 
example, 
“I 
think,” 
or 
as 
the 
superstition 
of 
Schopenhauer 
put 
it, 
“I 
will”; 
as 
though 
knowledge 
here 
got 
hold 
of 
its 
object 
purely 
and 
nakedly 
as 
“the 
thing 
in 
itself,” 
without 
any 
falsification 
on 
the 
part 
of 
either 
the 
subject 
or 
the 
object. 
But 
that 
“immediate 
certainty,” 
as 
well 
as 
“absolute 
knowledge” 
and 
the 
“thing 
in 
itself,” 
involve 
a 
contradictio 
in 
ad-jecto,21 
I 
shall 
repeat 
a 
hundred 
times; 
we 
really 
ought 
to 
free 
ourselves 
from 
the 
seduction 
of 
words! 


Let 
the 
people 
suppose 
that 
knowledge 
means 
knowing 
things 
entirely; 
the 
philosopher 
must 
say 
to 
himself: 
When 
I 
analyze 
the 
process 
that 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 
sentence, 
“I 
think,” 
I 
find 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
daring 
assertions 
that 
would 
be 
difficult, 
perhaps 
impossible, 
to 
prove; 
for 
example, 
that 
it 
is 
I 
who 
think, 
that 
there 
must 
necessarily 
be 
something 
that 
thinks, 
that 
thinking 
is 
an 
activity 
and 
operation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
a 
being 
who 
is 
thought 
of 
as 
a 
cause, 
that 
there 
is 
an 
“ego,” 
and, 
finally, 
that 
it 
is 
already 
determined 
what 
is 
to 
be 
designated 
by 
thinking—that 
I 
know 
what 
thinking 
is. 
For 
if 
I 
had 
not 
already 
decided 
within 
myself 
what 
it 
is, 
by 
what 
standard 
could 
I 
determine 
whether 
that 
which 
is 
just 
happening 
is 
not 
perhaps 
“willing” 
or 
“feeling”? 
In 
short, 
the 
assertion 
“I 
think” 
assumes 
that 
I 
compare 
my 
state 
at 
the 
present 
moment 
with 
other 
states 
of 
myself 
which 
I 
know, 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
what 
it 
is; 
on 
account 
of 
this 
retrospective 
connection 
with 
further 
“knowledge,” 
it 
has, 
at 
any 
rate, 
no 
immediate 
certainty 
for 
me. 


In 
place 
of 
the 
“immediate 
certainty” 
in 
which 
the 
people 
may 
believe 
in 
the 
case 
at 
hand, 
the 
philosopher 
thus 
finds 
a 
series 
of 
metaphysical 
questions 
presented 
to 
him, 
truly 
searching 
questions 
of 
the 
intellect; 
to 
wit: 
“From 
where 
do 
I 
get 
the 
concept 
of 
thinking? 
Why 
do 
I 
believe 
in 
cause 
and 
effect? 
What 
gives 
me 
the 
right 
to 
speak 
of 
an 
ego, 
and 
even 
of 
an 
ego 
as 
cause, 
and 
finally 
of 
an 
ego 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
thought?” 
Whoever 
ventures 
to 
answer 
these 
metaphysical 
questions 
at 
once 
by 
an 
appeal 
to 
a 
sort 
of 
intuitive 
perception, 
like 
the 
person 
who 
says, 
“I 
think, 
and 
know 
that 
this, 
at 
least, 
is 
true, 
actual, 
and 
certain”—will 
encounter 
a 
smile 
and 
two 
question 
marks 
from 
a 



philosopher 
nowadays. 
“Sir,” 
the 
philosopher 
will 
perhaps 
give 
him 
to 
understand, 
“it 
is 
improbable 
that 
you 
are 
not 
mistaken; 
but 
why 
insist 
on 
the 
truth?”— 



17 


With 
regard 
to 
the 
superstitions 
of 
logicians, 
I 
shall 
never 
tire 
of 
emphasizing 
a 
small 
terse 
fact, 
which 
these 
superstitious 
minds 
hate 
to 
concede—namely, 
that 
a 
thought 
comes 
when 
“it” 
wishes, 
and 
not 
when 
“I” 
wish, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
a 
falsification 
of 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case 
to 
say 
that 
the 
subject 
“I” 
is 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
predicate 
“think.” 
It 
thinks; 
but 
that 
this 
“it” 
is 
precisely 
the 
famous 
old 
“ego” 
is, 
to 
put 
it 
mildly, 
only 
a 
supposition, 
an 
assertion, 
and 
assuredly 
not 
an 
“immediate 
certainty.” 
After 
all, 
one 
has 
even 
gone 
too 
far 
with 
this 
“it 
thinks”—even 
the 
“it” 
contains 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
process, 
and 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
process 
itself. 
One 
infers 
here 
according 
to 
the 
grammatical 
habit: 
“Thinking 
is 
an 
activity; 
every 
activity 
requires 
an 
agent; 
consequently—” 


It 
was 
pretty 
much 
according 
to 
the 
same 
schema 
that 
the 
older 
atomism 
sought, 
besides 
the 
operating 
“power,” 
that 
lump 
of 
matter 
in 
which 
it 
resides 
and 
out 
of 
which 
it 
operates—the 
atom. 
More 
rigorous 
minds, 
however, 
learned 
at 
last 
to 
get 
along 
without 
this 
“earth-residuum,” 
and 
perhaps 
some 
day 
we 
shall 
accustom 
ourselves, 
including 
the 
logicians, 
to 
get 
along 
without 
the 
little 
“it” 
(which 
is 
all 
that 
is 
left 
of 
the 
honest

It 
is 
certainly 
not 
the 
least 
charm 
of 
a 
theory 
that 
it 
is 
refutable; 
it 
is 
precisely 
thereby 
that 
it 
attracts 
subtler 
minds. 
It 
seems 
that 
the 
hundredtimes-
refuted 
theory 
of 
a 
“free 
will” 
owes 
its 
persistence 
to 
this 
charm 
alone; 
again 
and 
again 
someone 
comes 
along 
who 
feels 
he 
is 
strong 
enough 
to 
refute 
it. 



19 


Philosophers 
are 
accustomed 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
will 
as 
if 
it 
were 
the 
best-
known 
thing 
in 
the 
world; 
indeed, 
Schopenhauer 
has 
given 
us 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
will 
alone 
is 
really 
known 
to 
us, 
absolutely 
and 
completely 
known, 
without 
subtraction 
or 
addition. 
But 
again 
and 
again 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
in 
this 
case, 
too, 
Schopenhauer 
only 
did 
what 
philosophers 
are 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
doing—he 
adopted 
a 
popular 
prejudice 
and 
exaggerated 
it. 
Willing 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
above 
all 
something 
complicated, 
something 
that 
is 
a 
unit 
only 
as 
a 
word—and 
it 
is 
precisely 
in 
this 
one 
word 
that 
the 
popular 
prejudice 
lurks, 
which 
has 
defeated 
the 
always 
inadequate 
caution 
of 
philosophers. 
So 
let 
us 
for 
once 
be 
more 
cautious, 
let 
us 
be 
“unphilosophical”: 
let 
us 
say 
that 
in 
all 
willing 
there 
is, 
first, 
a 
plurality 
of 
sensations, 
namely, 
the 
sensation 
of 
the 
state 
“away 
from 
which,” 
the 
sensation 
of 
the 
state 
“towards 
which,” 
the 
sensations 
of 
this 
“from” 
and 
“towards” 
themselves, 
and 
then 
also 
an 
accompanying 
muscular 
sensation, 
which, 
even 
without 
our 
putting 
into 
motion 
“arms 
and 
legs,” 
begins 
its 
action 
by 
force 
of 
habit 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
“will” 
anything. 


Therefore, 
just 
as 
sensations 
(and 
indeed 
many 
kinds 
of 
sensations) 
are 
to 
be 
recognized 
as 
ingredients 
of 
the 
will, 
so, 
secondly, 
should 
thinking 
also: 
in 
every 
act 
of 
the 
will 
there 
is 
a 
ruling 
thought—let 
us 
not 
imagine 
it 
possible 
to 
sever 
this 
thought 
from 
the 
“willing,” 
as 
if 
any 
will 
would 
then 
remain 
over! 


Third, 
the 
will 
is 
not 
only 
a 
complex 
of 
sensation 
and 
thinking, 
but 
it 
is 
above 
all 
an 
affect, 
and 
specifically 
the 
affect 
of 
the 
command. 
That 
which 
is 
termed 
“freedom 
of 
the 
will” 
is 
essentially 
the 
affect 
of 
superiority 
in 
relation 
to 
him 
who 
must 
obey: 
“I 
am 
free, 
‘he’ 
must 
obey”—this 
consciousness 
is 
inherent 
in 
every 
will; 
and 
equally 
so 
the 
straining 
of 
the 
attention, 
the 
straight 
look 
that 
fixes 
itself 
exclusively 
on 
one 
aim, 
the 
unconditional 
evaluation 
that 
“this 
and 
nothing 
else 
is 
necessary 
now,” 
the 
inward 
certainty 
that 
obedience 
will 
be 
rendered—and 
whatever 
else 
belongs 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
commander. 
A 
man 
who 
wills 
commands 
something 
within 
himself 
that 
renders 
obedience, 
or 
that 
he 
believes 
renders 
obedience. 


But 
now 
let 
us 
notice 
what 
is 
strangest 
about 
the 
will—this 
manifold 
thing 



for 
which 
the 
people 
have 
only 
one 
word: 
inasmuch 
as 
in 
the 
given 
circumstances 
we 
are 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
commanding 
and 
the 
obeying 
parties, 
and 
as 
the 
obeying 
party 
we 
know 
the 
sensations 
of 
constraint, 
impulsion, 
pressure, 
resistance, 
and 
motion, 
which 
usually 
begin 
immediately 
after 
the 
act 
of 
will; 
inasmuch 
as, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
disregard 
this 
duality, 
and 
to 
deceive 
ourselves 
about 
it 
by 
means 
of 
the 
synthetic 
concept 
“I,” 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
erroneous 
conclusions, 
and 
consequently 
of 
false 
evaluations 
of 
the 
will 
itself, 
has 
become 
attached 
to 
the 
act 
of 
willing—to 
such 
a 
degree 
that 
he 
who 
wills 
believes 
sincerely 
that 
willing 
suffices 
for 
action. 
Since 
in 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
cases 
there 
has 
been 
exercise 
of 
will 
only 
when 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
command—that 
is, 
obedience; 
that 
is, 
the 
action—was 
to 
be 
expected, 
the 
appearance 
has 
translated 
itself 
into 
the 
feeling, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
a 
necessity 
of 
effect. 
In 
short, 
he 
who 
wills 
believes 
with 
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
certainty 
that 
will 
and 
action 
are 
somehow 
one; 
he 
ascribes 
the 
success, 
the 
carrying 
out 
of 
the 
willing, 
to 
the 
will 
itself, 
and 
thereby 
enjoys 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
power 
which 
accompanies 
all 
success. 


“Freedom 
of 
the 
will”—that 
is 
the 
expression 
for 
the 
complex 
state 
of 
delight 
of 
the 
person 
exercising 
volition, 
who 
commands 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
identifies 
himself 
with 
the 
executor 
of 
the 
order—who, 
as 
such, 
enjoys 
also 
the 
triumph 
over 
obstacles, 
but 
thinks 
within 
himself 
that 
it 
was 
really 
his 
will 
itself 
that 
overcame 
them. 
In 
this 
way 
the 
person 
exercising 
volition 
adds 
the 
feelings 
of 
delight 
of 
his 
successful 
executive 
instruments, 
the 
useful 
“under-wills” 
or 
under-souls—indeed, 
our 
body 
is 
but 
a 
social 
structure 
composed 
of 
many 
souls—to 
his 
feelings 
of 
delight 
as 
commander. 
L’effet 
c’est 
moi:22 
what 
happens 
here 
is 
what 
happens 
in 
every 
well-constructed 
and 
happy 
commonwealth; 
namely, 
the 
governing 
class 
identifies 
itself 
with 
the 
successes 
of 
the 
commonwealth. 
In 
all 
willing 
it 
is 
absolutely 
a 
question 
of 
commanding 
and 
obeying, 
on 
the 
basis, 
as 
already 
said, 
of 
a 
social 
structure 
composed 
of 
many 
“souls.” 
Hence 
a 
philosopher 
should 
claim 
the 
right 
to 
include 
willing 
as 
such 
within 
the 
sphere 
of 
morals—morals 
being 
understood 
as 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
supremacy 
under 
which 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
“life” 
comes 
to 
be.

That 
individual 
philosophical 
concepts 
are 
not 
anything 
capricious 
or 
autonomously 
evolving, 
but 
grow 
up 
in 
connection 
and 
relationship 
with 
each 
other; 
that, 
however 
suddenly 
and 
arbitrarily 
they 
seem 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
history 
of 
thought, 
they 
nevertheless 
belong 
just 
as 
much 
to 
a 
system 
as 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
fauna 
of 
a 
continent—is 
betrayed 
in 
the 
end 
also 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
most 
diverse 
philosophers 
keep 
filling 
in 
a 
definite 
fundamental 
scheme 
of 
possible 
philosophies. 
Under 
an 
invisible 
spell, 
they 
always 
revolve 
once 
more 
in 
the 
same 
orbit; 
however 
independent 
of 
each 
other 
they 
may 
feel 
themselves 
with 
their 
critical 
or 
systematic 
wills, 
something 
within 
them 
leads 
them, 
something 
impels 
them 
in 
a 
definite 
order, 
one 
after 
the 
other—to 
wit, 
the 
innate 
systematic 
structure 
and 
relationship 
of 
their 
concepts. 
Their 
thinking 
is, 
in 
fact, 
far 
less 
a 
discovery 
than 
a 
recognition, 
a 
remembering, 
a 
return 
and 
a 
homecoming 
to 
a 
remote, 
primordial, 
and 
inclusive 
household 
of 
the 
soul, 
out 
of 
which 
those 
concepts 
grew 
originally: 
philosophizing 
is 
to 
this 
extent 
a 
kind 
of 
atavism 
of 
the 
highest 
order. 


The 
strange 
family 
resemblance 
of 
all 
Indian, 
Greek, 
and 
German 
philosophizing 
is 
explained 
easily 
enough. 
Where 
there 
is 
affinity 
of 
languages, 
it 
cannot 
fail, 
owing 
to 
the 
common 
philosophy 
of 
grammar—I 
mean, 
owing 
to 
the 
unconscious 
domination 
and 
guidance 
by 
similar 
grammatical 
functions—that 
everything 
is 
prepared 
at 
the 
outset 
for 
a 
similar 
development 
and 
sequence 
of 
philosophical 
systems; 
just 
as 
the 
way 
seems 
barred 
against 
certain 
other 
possibilities 
of 
world-interpretation. 
It 
is 
highly 
probable 
that 
philosophers 
within 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
Ural-Altaic 
languages 
(where 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
subject 
is 
least 
developed) 
look 
otherwise 
“into 
the 
world,” 
and 
will 
be 
found 
on 
paths 
of 
thought 
different 
from 
those 
of 
the 
Indo-Germanic 
peoples 
and 
the 
Muslims: 
the 
spell 
of 
certain 
grammatical 
functions 
is 
ultimately 
also 
the 
spell 
of 
physiological 
valuations 
and 
racial 
conditions. 


So 
much 
by 
way 
of 
rejecting 
Locke’s 
superficiality 
regarding 
the 
origin 
of 
ideas. 



21 


The 
causa 
sui 
is 
the 
best 
self-contradiction 
that 
has 
been 
conceived 
so 
far, 
it 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
rape 
and 
perversion 
of 
logic; 
but 
the 
extravagant 
pride 
of 
man 
has 
managed 
to 
entangle 
itself 
profoundly 
and 
frightfully 
with 
just 
this 
nonsense. 
The 
desire 
for 
“freedom 
of 
the 
will” 
in 
the 
superlative 
metaphysical 
sense, 
which 
still 
holds 
sway, 
unfortunately, 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
the 
half-educated; 
the 
desire 
to 
bear 
the 
entire 
and 
ultimate 
responsibility 
for 
one’s 
actions 
oneself, 
and 
to 
absolve 
God, 
the 
world, 
ancestors, 
chance, 
and 
society 
involves 
nothing 
less 
than 
to 
be 
precisely 
this 
causa 
sui 
and, 
with 
more 
than 
Münchhausen’s 
audacity, 
to 
pull 
oneself 
up 
into 
existence 
by 
the 
hair, 
out 
of 
the 
swamps 
of 
nothingness.23 
Suppose 
someone 
were 
thus 
to 
see 
through 
the 
boorish 
simplicity 
of 
this 
celebrated 
concept 
of 
“free 
will” 
and 
put 
it 
out 
of 
his 
head 
altogether, 
I 
beg 
of 
him 
to 
carry 
his 
“enlightenment” 
a 
step 
further, 
and 
also 
put 
out 
of 
his 
head 
the 
contrary 
of 
this 
monstrous 
conception 
of 
“free 
will”: 
I 
mean 
“unfree 
will,” 
which 
amounts 
to 
a 
misuse 
of 
cause 
and 
effect. 
One 
should 
not 
wrongly 
reify 
“cause” 
and 
“effect,” 
as 
the 
natural 
scientists 
do 
(and 
whoever, 
like 
them, 
now 
“naturalizes” 
in 
his 
thinking), 
according 
to 
the 
prevailing 
mechanical 
doltishness 
which 
makes 
the 
cause 
press 
and 
push 
until 
it 
“effects” 
its 
end; 
one 
should 
use 
“cause” 
and 
“effect” 
only 
as 
pure 
concepts, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
as 
conventional 
fictions 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
designation 
and 
communication—not 
for 
explanation. 
In 
the 
“initself” 
there 
is 
nothing 
of 
“causal 
connections,” 
of 
“necessity,” 
or 
of 
“psychological 
non-freedom”; 
there 
the 
effect 
does 
not 
follow 
the 
cause, 
there 
is 
no 
rule 
of 
“law.” 
It 
is 
we 
alone 
who 
have 
devised 
cause, 
sequence, 
for-each-other, 
relativity, 
constraint, 
number, 
law, 
freedom, 
motive, 
and 
purpose; 
and 
when 
we 
project 
and 
mix 
this 
symbol 
world 
into 
things 
as 
if 
it 
existed 
“in 
itself,” 
we 
act 
once 
more 
as 
we 
have 
always 
acted 
—mythologically. 
The 
“unfree 
will” 
is 
mythology; 
in 
real 
life 
it 
is 
only 
a 
matter 
of 
strong 
and 
weak 
wills. 


It 
is 
almost 
always 
a 
symptom 
of 
what 
is 
lacking 
in 
himself 
when 
a 
thinker 
senses 
in 
every 
“causal 
connection” 
and 
“psychological 
necessity” 
something 
of 
constraint, 
need, 
compulsion 
to 
obey, 
pressure, 
and 
unfreedom; 
it 
is 



suspicious 
to 
have 
such 
feelings—the 
person 
betrays 
himself. 
And 
in 
general, 
if 
I 
have 
observed 
correctly, 
the 
“unfreedom 
of 
the 
will” 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
problem 
from 
two 
entirely 
opposite 
standpoints, 
but 
always 
in 
a 
profoundly 
personal 
manner: 
some 
will 
not 
give 
up 
their 
“responsibility,” 
their 
belief 
in 
themselves, 
the 
personal 
right 
to 
their 
merits 
at 
any 
price 
(the 
vain 
races 
belong 
to 
this 
class). 
Others, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
be 
answerable 
for 
anything, 
or 
blamed 
for 
anything, 
and 
owing 
to 
an 
inward 
self-contempt, 
seek 
to 
lay 
the 
blame 
for 
themselves 
somewhere 
else. 
The 
latter, 
when 
they 
write 
books, 
are 
in 
the 
habit 
today 
of 
taking 
the 
side 
of 
criminals; 
a 
sort 
of 
socialist 
pity 
is 
their 
most 
attractive 
disguise. 
And 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
the 
fatalism 
of 
the 
weak-willed 
embellishes 
itself 
surprisingly 
when 
it 
can 
pose 
as 
“la 
religion 
de 
la 
souffrance 
humaine”;24 
that 
is 
its 
“good 
taste.” 



22 


Forgive 
me 
as 
an 
old 
philologist 
who 
cannot 
desist 
from 
the 
malice 
of 
putting 
his 
finger 
on 
bad 
modes 
of 
interpretation: 
but 
“nature’s 
conformity 
to 
law,” 
of 
which 
you 
physicists 
talk 
so 
proudly, 
as 
though—why, 
it 
exists 
only 
owing 
to 
your 
interpretation 
and 
bad 
“philology.” 
It 
is 
no 
matter 
of 
fact, 
no 
“text,” 
but 
rather 
only 
a 
naively 
humanitarian 
emendation 
and 
perversion 
of 
meaning, 
with 
which 
you 
make 
abundant 
concessions 
to 
the 
democratic 
instincts 
of 
the 
modern 
soul! 
“Everywhere 
equality 
before 
the 
law; 
nature 
is 
no 
different 
in 
that 
respect, 
no 
better 
off 
than 
we 
are”—a 
fine 
instance 
of 
ulterior 
motivation, 
in 
which 
the 
plebeian 
antagonism 
to 
everything 
privileged 
and 
autocratic 
as 
well 
as 
a 
second 
and 
more 
refined 
atheism 
are 
disguised 
once 
more. 
“Ni 
Dieu, 
ni 
maître”25—that 
is 
what 
you, 
too, 
want; 
and 
therefore 
“cheers 
for 
the 
law 
of 
nature!”—is 
it 
not 
so? 
But 
as 
said 
above, 
that 
is 
interpretation, 
not 
text; 
and 
somebody 
might 
come 
along 
who, 
with 
opposite 
intentions 
and 
modes 
of 
interpretation, 
could 
read 
out 
of 
the 
same 
“nature,” 
and 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
same 
phenomena, 
rather 
the 
tyrannically 
inconsiderate 
and 
relentless 
enforcement 
of 
claims 
of 
power—an 
interpreter 
who 
would 
picture 
the 
unexceptional 
and 
unconditional 
aspects 
of 
all 
“will 
to 
power” 
so 
vividly 
that 
almost 
every 
word, 
even 
the 
word 
“tyranny” 
itself, 
would 
eventually 
seem 
unsuitable, 
or 
a 
weakening 
and 
attenuating 
metaphor 
—being 
too 
human—but 
he 
might, 
nevertheless, 
end 
by 
asserting 
the 
same 
about 
this 
world 
as 
you 
do, 
namely, 
that 
it 
has 
a 
“necessary” 
and 
“calculable” 
course, 
not 
because 
laws 
obtain 
in 
it, 
but 
because 
they 
are 
absolutely 
lacking, 
and 
every 
power 
draws 
its 
ultimate 
consequences 
at 
every 
moment. 
Supposing 
that 
this 
also 
is 
only 
interpretation—and 
you 
will 
be 
eager 
enough 
to 
make 
this 
objection?—well, 
so 
much 
the 
better.

All 
psychology 
so 
far 
has 
got 
stuck 
in 
moral 
prejudices 
and 
fears; 
it 
has 
not 
dared 
to 
descend 
into 
the 
depths. 
To 
understand 
it 
as 
morphology 
and 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
as 
I 
do—nobody 
has 
yet 
come 
close 
to 
doing 
this 
even 
in 
thought—insofar 
as 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
recognize 
in 
what 
has 
been 
written 
so 
far 
a 
symptom 
of 
what 
has 
so 
far 
been 
kept 
silent. 
The 
power 
of 
moral 
prejudices 
has 
penetrated 
deeply 
into 
the 
most 
spiritual 
world, 
which 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
the 
coldest 
and 
most 
devoid 
of 
presuppositions, 
and 
has 
obviously 
operated 
in 
an 
injurious, 
inhibiting, 
blinding, 
and 
distorting 
manner. 
A 
proper 
physio-psychology 
has 
to 
contend 
with 
unconscious 
resistance 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
investigator, 
it 
has 
“the 
heart” 
against 
it: 
even 
a 
doctrine 
of 
the 
reciprocal 
dependence 
of 
the 
“good” 
and 
the 
“wicked” 
drives, 
causes 
(as 
refined 
immorality) 
distress 
and 
aversion 
in 
a 
still 
hale 
and 
hearty 
conscience—still 
more 
so, 
a 
doctrine 
of 
the 
derivation 
of 
all 
good 
impulses 
from 
wicked 
ones. 
If, 
however, 
a 
person 
should 
regard 
even 
the 
affects 
of 
hatred, 
envy, 
covetousness, 
and 
the 
lust 
to 
rule 
as 
conditions 
of 
life, 
as 
factors 
which, 
fundamentally 
and 
essentially, 
must 
be 
present 
in 
the 
general 
economy 
of 
life 
(and 
must, 
therefore, 
be 
further 
enhanced 
if 
life 
is 
to 
be 
further 
enhanced)— 
he 
will 
suffer 
from 
such 
a 
view 
of 
things 
as 
from 
seasickness. 
And 
yet 
even 
this 
hypothesis 
is 
far 
from 
being 
the 
strangest 
and 
most 
painful 
in 
this 
immense 
and 
almost 
new 
domain 
of 
dangerous 
insights; 
and 
there 
are 
in 
fact 
a 
hundred 
good 
reasons 
why 
everyone 
should 
keep 
away 
from 
it 
who—can. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
one 
has 
once 
drifted 
there 
with 
one’s 
bark, 
well! 
all 
right! 
let 
us 
clench 
our 
teeth! 
let 
us 
open 
our 
eyes 
and 
keep 
our 
hand 
firm 
on 
the 
helm! 
We 
sail 
right 
over 
morality, 
we 
crush, 
we 
destroy 
perhaps 
the 
remains 
of 
our 
own 
morality 
by 
daring 
to 
make 
our 
voyage 
there—but 
what 
matter 
are 
we! 
Never 
yet 
did 
a 
profounder 
world 
of 
insight 
reveal 
itself 
to 
daring 
travellers 
and 
adventurers, 
and 
the 
psychologist 
who 
thus 
“makes 
a 
sacrifice”—it 
is 
not 
the 
sacrifizio 
dell’ 
intelletto,26 
on 
the 
contrary!—will 
at 
least 
be 
entitled 
to 
demand 
in 
return 
that 
psychology 
shall 
be 
recognized 
again27 
as 
the 
queen 
of 
the 
sciences, 
for 
whose 
service 
and 
preparation 
the 



other 
sciences 
exist. 
For 
psychology 
is 
now 
again 
the 
path 
to 
the 
fundamental 
problems.

Marianne 
Cowan 
has 
suggested 
in 
the 
preface 
to 
her 
translation 
that 
Nietzsche 
divided 
this 
book 
“into 
‘articles’ 
like 
articles 
of 
faith,” 
and 
she 
sees 
“irony 
in 
this.” 
But 
there 
is 
no 
warrant 
for 
rendering 
Hauptstück 
as 
“article”: 
it 
means 
“major 
part.” 
Kant’s 
Critique 
of 
Pure 
Reason 
and 
Critique 
of 
Practical 
Reason 
are 
both 
divided 
into 
Hauptstücke. 
So 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
Human, 
All-Too-Human. 
The 
term 
is 
obviously 
particularly 
appropriate 
for 
books 
subdivided 
into 
many 
short 
sections. 


2 
Nietzsche’s 
attack 
on 
this 
faith 
is 
prefigured 
in 
the 
title 
of 
the 
book. 
This 
aphorism 
invites 
comparison 
with 
the 
first 
aphorism 
of 
Human, 
Ail-Too-Human.

One 
of 
Kant’s 
central 
questions 
was, 
“How 
are 
synthetic 


judgments 
a 
priori 
possible?” 
He 
meant 
judgments 
that 
are 
known 
for 
certain 
to 
be 
true, 
independently 
of 
experience, 
but 
not 
by 
definition. 
His 
examples 
include 
the 
judgment 
that 
every 
event 
has 
a 
cause. 
Hans 
Vaihinger, 
a 
leading 
Kant 
scholar 
who 
published 
a 
book 
on 
Nietzsche 
als 
Philosoph 
(1902; 
4th 
ed. 
1916), 
later 
published 
his 
own 
theory 
of 
necessary 
fictions 
under 
the 
title, 
Die 
Philosophie 
des 
Als-Ob 
(1911; 
English 
tr. 
by 
C. 
K. 
Ogden, 
1924: 
The 
Philosophy 
of

devoting 
the 
final 
chapter

a 
detailed 
discussion 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
similar 
ideas.

Nietzsche 
is 
thinking 
of 
the 
“great” 
philosophers. 
Now 
that 
there 
are 
literally 
thousands 
of 
“philosophers,” 
these 
tend 
to 
be 
more 
akin 
to 
their 
colleagues 
in 
other 
departments 
than 
to 
the 
men 
discussed 
here.

The 
reference 
is 
to 
Epicurus’ 
fragment 
238, 
and 
the 
ambiguity 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
Dionysius 
was 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Sicilian 
tyrant 
whom 
Plato 
had 
tried 
for 
several 
years 
to

to 
his 
own 
philosophy.

17Affekt: 
I 
have 
rendered 
this 
term 
consistently 
as 
“affect”: 
good 
dictionaries 
include 
the 
relevant 
meanings. 
“Feeling” 
comes 
close 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
meaning 
but 
fails 
to 
suggest 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
term 
is 
somewhat 
technical 
and 
carries 
overtones 
of 
Spinoza’s 
affectus 
and 
a 
long 
philosophical 
tradition. 
Moreover, 
“feeling” 
is 
needed 
to 
render 
Gefühl, 
which 
occurs 
several 
times 
in 
this 
section. 


In 
his 
discussion 
of 
Spinoza’s 
affectus, 
Stuart 
Hampshire 
uses 
“affection” 
and 
places 
the 
word 
in 
quotation 
marks 
(Spinoza, 
Baltimore, 
Penguin 
Books, 
1951, 
pp. 
135f.). 
In 
James 
Mark 
Baldwin’s 
Dictionary 
of 
Philosophy 
and 
Psychology, 
vol. 
I 
(1901), 
“affect” 
is 
defined 
as 
“A 
stimulus 
or 
motive 
to 
action 
which 
is 
AFFECTIVE 
(q.v.) 
or 
felt, 
not 
presented 
as 
an 
end,” 
a 
usage 
“suggested 
by 
Baldwin,” 
while 
“affection” 
is 
suggested 
as 
an 
equivalent 
of 
the 
German 
Affekt, 
which 
is 
defined 
as 
“passing 
emotional 
states 
… 
The 
best 
writers 
distinguish 
it 
from 
passion, 
as 
having 
less 
vehemence, 
and 
as 
less 
distinctly, 
if 
at 
all, 
connected 
with 
a 
sensuous 
basis.… 
St. 
Augustine, 
as 
quoted 
and 
adopted 
by 
Aquinas, 
says: 
Those 
mental 
states 
(motus 
animi) 
which 
the 
Greeks 
call 
pathē, 
and 
Cicero 
perturhationes, 
are 
by 
some 
called 
affectus, 
or 
affectiones 
by 
others, 
keeping 
to 
the 
literal 
rendering 
of 
the 
Greek 
passiones.’ 
“ 


My 
reason 
for 
preferring 
“affect” 
to 
“affection” 
is 
that 
the 
former 
is 
readily 
recognized 
as 
a 
technical 
term, 
while 
the 
latter 
is 
very 
apt 
to 
be 
misunderstood 
as 
suggesting 
a 
mild 
form 
of 
love.

“I

Cf. 
Sartre’s 
famous 
dictum: 
“If 
man 
as 
the 
existentialist 
sees 
him 
is 
not 
definable, 
it 
is 
because 
to 
begin 
with 
he 
is 
nothing. 
He 
will 
not 
be 
anything 
until 
later, 
and 
then 
he 
will 
be 
what 
he 
makes 
of 
himself.… 
Man 
simply 
is. 
Not 
that 
he 
is 
simply 
what 
he 
conceives 
himself 
to 
be, 
but 
he 
is 
what 
he 
wills 
… 
Man 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
that 
which 
he 
makes 
of 
himself. 
That 
is 
the 
first 
principle 
of 
existentialism.… 
Before 
that 
projection 
of 
the 
self 
nothing 
exists 
… 
Man 
is 
responsible 
for 
what 
he 
is. 
Thus, 
the 
first 
effect 
of 
existentialism 
is 
that 
it 
puts 
every 
man 
in 
possession 
of 
himself 
as 
he 
is, 
and 
places 
the 
entire 
responsibility 
for 
his 
existence 
squarely 
upon 
his 
own 
shoulders” 
(“Existentialism 
Is 
a 
Humanism,” 
included 
in 
Existentialism 
from 
Dostoevsky 
to 
Sartre, 
ed. 
Walter 
Kaufmann, 
pp. 
290f.). 


Reading 
this 
without 
knowing 
that 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
was 
published 
in 
1886 
and 
Sartre’s 
lecture 
in 
1946, 
one 
would 
scarcely 
guess 
at 
Nietzsche’s 
immense 
influence 
on 
existentialism 
in 
general 
and 
Sartre 
in 
particular; 
one 
might 
even 
suppose 
that 
Nietzsche 
was 
here 
polemicizing 
against 
Sartre. 
Cf. 
also

8 
of 
“The 
Four 
Great 
Errors” 
in 
Twilight 
of

500), 
where 
some 
implications 
of 
the 
above 
passage 
in 
Beyond 
Good

Evil 
are 
developed 
briefly.

O 
sancta 
simplicitas!1 
In 
what 
strange 
simplification 
and 
falsification 
man 
lives! 
One 
can 
never 
cease 
wondering 
once 
one 
has 
acquired 
eyes 
for 
this 
marvel! 
How 
we 
have 
made 
everything 
around 
us 
clear 
and 
free 
and 
easy 
and 
simple! 
how 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
give 
our 
senses 
a 
passport 
to 
everything 
superficial, 
our 
thoughts 
a 
divine 
desire 
for 
wanton 
leaps 
and 
wrong 
inferences! 
how 
from 
the 
beginning 
we 
have 
contrived 
to 
retain 
our 
ignorance 
in 
order 
to 
enjoy 
an 
almost 
inconceivable 
freedom, 
lack 
of 
scruple 
and 
caution, 
heartiness, 
and 
gaiety 
of 
life—in 
order 
to 
enjoy 
life! 
And 
only 
on 
this 
now 
solid, 
granite 
foundation 
of 
ignorance 
could 
knowledge 
rise 
so 
far—the 
will 
to 
knowledge 
on 
the 
foundation 
of 
a 
far 
more 
powerful 
will: 
the 
will 
to 
ignorance, 
to 
the 
uncertain, 
to 
the 
untrue! 
Not 
as 
its 
opposite, 
but—as 
its 
refinement! 


Even 
if 
language, 
here 
as 
elsewhere, 
will 
not 
get 
over 
its 
awkwardness, 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
talk 
of 
opposites 
where 
there 
are 
only 
degrees 
and 
many 
subtleties 
of 
gradation; 
even 
if 
the 
inveterate 
Tartuffery 
of 
morals, 
which 
now 
belongs 
to 
our 
unconquerable 
“flesh 
and 
blood,” 
infects 
the 
words 
even 
of 
those 
of 
us 
who 
know 
better—here 
and 
there 
we 
understand 
it 
and 
laugh 
at 
the 
way 
in 
which 
precisely 
science 
at 
its 
best 
seeks 
most 
to 
keep 
us 
in 
this 
simplified, 
thoroughly 
artificial, 
suitably 
constructed 
and 
suitably 
falsified 
world—at 
the 
way 
in 
which, 
willy-nilly, 
it 
loves 
error, 
because, 
being 
alive, 
it 
loves 
life. 



25 


After 
such 
a 
cheerful 
commencement, 
a 
serious 
word 
would 
like 
to 
be 
heard; 
it 
appeals 
to 
the 
most 
serious. 
Take 
care, 
philosophers 
and 
friends, 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
beware 
of 
martyrdom! 
Of 
suffering 
“for 
the 
truth’s 
sake”! 
Even 
of 
defending 
yourselves! 
It 
spoils 
all 
the 
innocence 
and 
fine 
neutrality 
of 
your 
conscience; 
it 
makes 
you 
headstrong 
against 
objections 
and 
red 
rags; 
it 
stupefies, 
animalizes, 
and 
brutalizes 
when 
in 
the 
struggle 
with 
danger, 
slander, 
suspicion, 
expulsion, 
and 
even 
worse 
consequences 
of 
hostility, 
you 
have 
to 
pose 
as 
protectors 
of 
truth 
upon 
earth—as 
though 
“the 
truth” 
were 
such 
an 
innocuous 
and 
incompetent 
creature 
as 
to 
require 
protectors! 
and 
you 
of 
all 
people, 
you 
knights 
of 
the 
most 
sorrowful 
countenance,2 
dear 
loafers 
and 
cobweb-spinners 
of 
the 
spirit! 
After 
all, 
you 
know 
well 
enough 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
of 
any 
consequence 
if 
you 
of 
all 
people 
are 
proved 
right; 
you 
know 
that 
no 
philosopher 
so 
far 
has 
been 
proved 
right, 
and 
that 
there 
might 
be 
a 
more 
laudable 
truthfulness 
in 
every 
little 
question 
mark 
that 
you 
place 
after 
your 
special 
words 
and 
favorite 
doctrines 
(and 
occasionally 
after 
yourselves) 
than 
in 
all 
the 
solemn 
gestures 
and 
trumps 
before 
accusers 
and 
law 
courts.3 
Rather, 
go 
away. 
Flee 
into 
concealment. 
And 
have 
your 
masks 
and 
subtlety,4 
that 
you 
may 
be 
mistaken 
for 
what 
you 
are 
not, 
or 
feared 
a 
little. 
And 
don’t 
forget 
the 
garden, 
the 
garden 
with 
golden 
trelliswork. 
And 
have 
people 
around 
you 
who 
are 
as 
a 
garden—or 
as 
music 
on 
the 
waters 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
the 
day 
is 
turning 
into 
memories. 
Choose 
the 
good 
solitude, 
the 
free, 
playful, 
light 
solitude 
that 
gives 
you, 
too, 
the 
right 
to 
remain 
good 
in 
some 
sense. 
How 
poisonous, 
how 
crafty, 
how 
bad, 
does 
every 
long 
war 
make 
one, 
that 
cannot 
be 
waged 
openly 
by 
means 
of 
force! 
How 
personal 
does 
a 
long 
fear 
make 
one, 
a 
long 
watching 
of 
enemies, 
of 
possible 
enemies! 
These 
outcasts 
of 
society, 
these 
long-pursued, 
wickedly 
persecuted 
ones—also 
the 
compulsory 
recluses, 
the 
Spinozas 
or 
Giordano 
Brunos—always 
become 
in 
the 
end, 
even 
under 
the 
most 
spiritual 
masquerade, 
and 
perhaps 
without 
being 
themselves 
aware 
of 
it, 
sophisticated 
vengeance-seekers 
and 
poison-brewers 
(let 
someone 
lay 
bare 
the 
foundation 
of 
Spinoza’s 
ethics 
and 
theology!), 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
stupidity 
of 
moral 
indignation, 
which 
is 
the 
unfailing 
sign 
in 
a 



philosopher 
that 
his 
philosophical 
sense 
of 
humor 
has 
left 
him. 
The 
martyrdom 
of 
the 
philosopher, 
his 
“sacrifice 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
truth,” 
forces 
into 
the 
light 
whatever 
of 
the 
agitator 
and 
actor 
lurks 
in 
him; 
and 
if 
one 
has 
so 
far 
contemplated 
him 
only 
with 
artistic 
curiosity, 
with 
regard 
to 
many 
a 
philosopher 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
the 
dangerous 
desire 
to 
see 
him 
also 
in 
his 
degeneration 
(degenerated 
into 
a 
“martyr,” 
into 
a 
stage-and 
platform-
bawler). 
Only, 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
with 
such 
a 
desire 
to 
be 
clear 
what 
spectacle 
one 
will 
see 
in 
any 
case—merely 
a 
satyr 
play, 
merely 
an 
epilogue 
farce, 
merely 
the 
continued 
proof 
that 
the 
long, 
real 
tragedy 
is 
at 
an 
end, 
assuming 
that 
every 
philosophy 
was 
in 
its 
genesis 
a 
long 
tragedy. 



26 


Every 
choice 
human 
being 
strives 
instinctively 
for 
a 
citadel 
and 
a 
secrecy 
where 
he 
is 
saved 
from 
the 
crowd, 
the 
many, 
the 
great 
majority—where 
he 
may 
forget 
“men 
who 
are 
the 
rule,” 
being 
their 
exception—excepting 
only 
the 
one 
case 
in 
which 
he 
is 
pushed 
straight 
to 
such 
men 
by 
a 
still 
stronger 
instinct, 
as 
a 
seeker 
after 
knowledge 
in 
the 
great 
and 
exceptional 
sense. 
Anyone 
who, 
in 
intercourse 
with 
men, 
does 
not 
occasionally 
glisten 
in 
all 
the 
colors 
of 
distress, 
green 
and 
gray 
with 
disgust, 
satiety, 
sympathy, 
gloominess, 
and 
loneliness, 
is 
certainly 
not 
a 
man 
of 
elevated 
tastes; 
supposing, 
however, 
that 
he 
does 
not 
take 
all 
this 
burden 
and 
disgust 
upon 
himself 
voluntarily, 
that 
he 
persistently 
avoids 
it, 
and 
remains, 
as 
I 
said, 
quietly 
and 
proudly 
hidden 
in 
his 
citadel, 
one 
thing 
is 
certain: 
he 
was 
not 
made, 
he 
was 
not 
predestined, 
for 
knowledge. 
If 
he 
were, 
he 
would 
one 
day 
have 
to 
say 
to 
himself: 
“The 
devil 
take 
my 
good 
tasto! 
but 
the 
rule 
is 
more 
interesting 
than 
the 
exception—than 
myself, 
the 
exception!” 
And 
he 
would 
go 
down,5 
and 
above 
all, 
he 
would 
go 
“inside.” 


The 
long 
and 
serious 
study 
of 
the 
average 
man, 
and 
consequently 
much 
disguise, 
self-overcoming, 
familiarity, 
and 
bad 
contact 
(all 
contact 
is 
bad 
contact 
except 
with 
one’s 
equals)—this 
constitutes 
a 
necessary 
part 
of 
the 
life-history 
of 
every 
philosopher, 
perhaps 
the 
most 
disagreeable, 
odious, 
and 
disappointing 
part. 
If 
he 
is 
fortunate, 
however, 
as 
a 
favorite 
child 
of 
knowledge 
should 
be, 
he 
will 
encounter 
suitable 
shortcuts 
and 
helps 
for 
his 
task; 
I 
mean 
so-called 
cynics, 
those 
who 
simply 
recognize 
the 
animal, 
the 
commonplace, 
and 
“the 
rule” 
in 
themselves, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
still 
have 
that 
degree 
of 
spirituality 
and 
that 
itch 
which 
makes 
them 
talk 
of 
themselves 
and 
their 
likes 
before 
witnesses—sometimes 
they 
even 
wallow 
in 
books, 
as 
on 
their 
own 
dung. 


Cynicism 
is 
the 
only 
form 
in 
which 
base 
souls 
approach 
honesty; 
and 
the 
higher 
man 
must 
listen 
closely 
to 
every 
coarse 
or 
subtle 
cynicism, 
and 
congratulate 
himself 
when 
a 
clown 
without 
shame 
or 
a 
scientific 
satyr 
speaks 
out 
precisely 
in 
front 
of 
him. 


There 
are 
even 
cases 
where 
enchantment 
mixes 
with 
the 
disgust—namely, 



where 
by 
a 
freak 
of 
nature 
genius 
is 
tied 
to 
some 
such 
indiscreet 
billygoat 
and 
ape, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Abbé 
Galiani,6 
the 
profoundest, 
most 
clear-sighted, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
filthiest 
man 
of 
his 
century—he 
was 
far 
profounder 
than 
Voltaire 
and 
consequently 
also 
a 
good 
deal 
more 
taciturn. 
It 
happens 
more 
frequently, 
as 
has 
been 
hinted, 
that 
a 
scientific 
head 
is 
placed 
on 
an 
ape’s 
body, 
a 
subtle 
exceptional 
understanding 
in 
a 
base 
soul, 
an 
occurrence 
by 
no 
means 
rare, 
especially 
among 
doctors 
and 
physiologists 
of 
morality. 
And 
whenever 
anyone 
speaks 
without 
bitterness, 
quite 
innocently, 
of 
man 
as 
a 
belly 
with 
two 
requirements, 
and 
a 
head 
with 
one; 
whenever 
anyone 
sees, 
seeks, 
and 
wants 
to 
see 
only 
hunger, 
sexual 
lust, 
and 
vanity 
as 
the 
real 
and 
only 
motives 
of 
human 
actions; 
in 
short, 
when 
anyone 
speaks 
“badly”— 
and 
not 
even 
“wickedly”—of 
man, 
the 
lover 
of 
knowledge 
should 
listen 
subtly 
and 
diligently; 
he 
should 
altogether 
have 
an 
open 
ear 
wherever 
people 
talk 
without 
indignation. 
For 
the 
indignant 
and 
whoever 
perpetually 
tears 
and 
lacerates 
with 
his 
own 
teeth 
himself 
(or 
as 
a 
substitute, 
the 
world, 
or 
God, 
or 
society) 
may 
indeed, 
morally 
speaking, 
stand 
higher 
than 
the 
laughing 
and 
self-satisfied 
satyr, 
but 
in 
every 
other 
sense 
they 
are 
a 
more 
ordinary, 
more 
indifferent, 
and 
less 
instructive 
case. 
And 
no 
one 
lies 
as 
much 
as 
the 
indignant 
do. 


Far 
from 
being 
merely 
playful 
or 
concerned 
with 
style 
to 
the 
exclusion 
of 
philosophy, 
this 
section 
touches 
on 
a 
crucial 
problem: 
Nietzsche’s 
tempo 
is 
a 
major 
reason 
for 
the 
long 
delay 
in 
his 
reception 
as 
a 
philosopher; 
and 
three 
quarters 
of 
a 
century 
after 
the 
appearance 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
the 
tempo 
of 
articles 
in 
British 
and 
American 
philosophical 
journals 
had 
slowed 
down 
to 
the 
point 
where 
many 
philosophers 
were 
bound 
to 
feel 
that 
anything 
written 
gāngāsrotagati 
simply 
could 
not 
be 
philosophy. 
Even 
Wittgenstein, 
though 
he 
had 
never 
followed 
the 
fashion 
of 
moving 
like 
the 
tortoise, 
had 
at 
least 
proceeded 
mandūkagati. 
For 
this 
whole 
question 
of 
philosophical 
style 
and 
tempo 
see 
Kaufmann, 
Critique 
of 
Religion 
and 
Philosophy 
(Garden 
City, 
N.Y., 
Anchor 
Books), 
sections 
3-10. 



27 


It 
is 
hard 
to 
be 
understood, 
especially 
when 
one 
thinks 
and 
lives 
gāngāsrotagati7 
among 
men 
who 
think 
and 
live 
differently—namely, 
kūrmagati,8 
or 
at 
best 
“the 
way 
frogs 
walk,” 
mandūka-gati9(I 
obviously 
do 
everything 
to 
be 
“hard 
to 
understand” 
myself!)—and 
one 
should 
be 
cordially 
grateful 
for 
the 
good 
will 
to 
some 
subtlety 
of 
interpretation. 
As 
regards 
“the 
good 
friends,” 
however, 
who 
are 
always 
too 
lazy 
and 
think 
that 
as 
friends 
they 
have 
a 
right 
to 
relax, 
one 
does 
well 
to 
grant 
them 
from 
the 
outset 
some 
leeway 
and 
romping 
place 
for 
misunderstanding: 
then 
one 
can 
even 
laugh— 
or 
get 
rid 
of 
them 
altogether, 
these 
good 
friends—and 
also 
laugh. 



28 


What 
is 
most 
difficult 
to 
render 
from 
one 
language 
into 
another 
is 
the 
tempo 
of 
its 
style, 
which 
has 
its 
basis 
in 
the 
character 
of 
the 
race, 
or 
to 
speak 
more 
physiologically, 
in 
the 
average 
tempo 
of 
its 
metabolism. 
There 
are 
honestly 
meant 
translations 
that, 
as 
involuntary 
vulgarizations, 
are 
almost 
falsifications 
of 
the 
original, 
merely 
because 
its 
bold 
and 
merry 
tempo 
(which 
leaps 
over 
and 
obviates 
all 
dangers 
in 
things 
and 
words) 
could 
not 
be 
translated. 
A 
German 
is 
almost 
incapable 
of 
presto10 
in 
his 
language; 
thus 
also, 
as 
may 
be 
reasonably 
inferred, 
of 
many 
of 
the 
most 
delightful 
and 
daring 
nuances 
of 
free, 
free-spirited 
thought. 
And 
just 
as 
the 
buffoon 
and 
satyr 
are 
foreign 
to 
him 
in 
body 
and 
conscience, 
so 
Aristophanes 
and 
Petronius 
are 
untranslatable 
for 
him. 
Everything 
ponderous, 
viscous, 
and 
solemnly 
clumsy, 
all 
long-winded 
and 
boring 
types 
of 
style 
are 
developed 
in 
profuse 
variety 
among 
Germans—forgive 
me 
the 
fact 
that 
even 
Goethe’s 
prose, 
in 
its 
mixture 
of 
stiffness 
and 
elegance, 
is 
no 
exception, 
being 
a 
reflection 
of 
the 
“good 
old 
time” 
to 
which 
it 
belongs, 
and 
a 
reflection 
of 
German 
taste 
at 
a 
time 
when 
there 
still 
was 
a 
“German 
taste”—a 
rococo 
taste 


11 


in 
moribus 
et 
artibus. 


Lessing 
is 
an 
exception, 
owing 
to 
his 
histrionic 
nature 
which 
understood 
much 
and 
understood 
how 
to 
do 
many 
things. 
He 
was 
not 
the 
translator 
of 
Bayle 
for 
nothing 
and 
liked 
to 
flee 
to 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
Diderot 
and 
Voltaire, 
and 
better 
yet 
that 
of 
the 
Roman 
comedy 
writers. 
In 
tempo, 
too, 
Lessing 
loved 
free 
thinking 
and 
escape 
from 
Germany. 
But 
how 
could 
the 
German 
language, 
even 
in 
the 
prose 
of 
a 
Lessing, 
imitate 
the 
tempo 
of 
Machia-velli,12 
who 
in 
his 
Principe 
[The 
Prince] 
lets 
us 
breathe 
the 
dry, 
refined 
air 
of 
Florence 
and 
cannot 
help 
presenting 
the 
most 
serious 
matters 
in 
a 
boisterous 
allegrissimo,13 
perhaps 
not 
without 
a 
malicious 
artistic 
sense 
of 
the 
contrast 
he 
risks—long, 
difficult, 
hard, 
dangerous 
thoughts 
and 
the 
tempo 
of 
the 
gallop 
and 
the 
very 
best, 
most 
capricious 
humor? 


Who, 
finally, 
could 
venture 
on 
a 
German 
translation 
of 
Petronius, 
who, 
more 
than 
any 
great 
musician 
so 
far, 
was 
a 
master 
of 
presto 
in 
invention, 
ideas, 
and 
words? 
What 
do 
the 
swamps 
of 
the 
sick, 
wicked 
world, 
even 
the 



“ancient 
world,” 
matter 
in 
the 
end, 
when 
one 
has 
the 
feet 
of 
a 
wind 
as 
he 
did, 
the 
rush, 
the 
breath, 
the 
liberating 
scorn 
of 
a 
wind 
that 
makes 
everything 
healthy 
by 
making 
everything 
run! 
And 
as 
for 
Aristophanes—that 
transfiguring, 
complementary 
spirit 
for 
whose 
sake 
one 
forgives 
everything 
Hellenic 
for 
having 
existed, 
provided 
one 
has 
understood 
in 
its 
full 
profundity 
all 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
forgiven 
and 
transfigured 
here—there 
is 
nothing 
that 
has 
caused 
me 
to 
meditate 
more 
on 
Plato’s 
secrecy 
and 
sphinx 
nature 
than 
the 
happily 
preserved 
petit 
fait14 
that 
under 
the 
pillow 
of 
his 
deathbed 
there 
was 
found 
no 
“Bible,” 
nor 
anything 
Egyptian, 
Pythagorean, 
or 
Platonic—but 
a 
volume 
of 
Aristophanes. 
How 
could 
even 
Plato 
have 
endured 
life—a 
Greek 
life 
he 
repudiated—without 
an 
Aristophanes? 



29 


Independence 
is 
for 
the 
very 
few; 
it 
is 
a 
privilege 
of 
the 
strong. 
And 
whoever 
attempts 
it 
even 
with 
the 
best 
right 
but 
without 
inner 
constraint 
proves 
that 
he 
is 
probably 
not 
only 
strong, 
but 
also 
daring 
to 
the 
point 
of 
recklessness. 
He 
enters 
into 
a 
labyrinth, 
he 
multiplies 
a 
thousandfold 
the 
dangers 
which 
life 
brings 
with 
it 
in 
any 
case, 
not 
the 
least 
of 
which 
is 
that 
no 
one 
can 
see 
how 
and 
where 
he 
loses 
his 
way, 
becomes 
lonely, 
and 
is 
torn 
piecemeal 
by 
some 
minotaur 
of 
conscience. 
Supposing 
one 
like 
that 
comes 
to 
grief, 
this 
happens 
so 
far 
from 
the 
comprehension 
of 
men 
that 
they 
neither 
feel 
it 
nor 
sympathize. 
And 
he 
cannot 
go 
back 
any 
longer. 
Nor 
can 
he 
go 
back 
to 
the 
pity 
of 
men.—

Our 
highest 
insights 
must—and 
should—sound 
like 
follies 
and 
sometimes 
like 
crimes 
when 
they 
are 
heard 
without 
permission 
by 
those 
who 
are 
not 
predisposed 
and 
predestined 
for 
them.15 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
exoteric 
and 
the 
esoteric, 
formerly 
known 
to 
philosophers—among 
the 
Indians 
as 
among 
the 
Greeks, 
Persians, 
and 
Muslims, 
in 
short, 
wherever 
one 
believed 
in 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
and 
not 
in 
equality 
and 
equal 
rights—does 
not 
so 
much 
consist 
in 
this, 
that 
the 
exoteric 
approach 
comes 
from 
outside 
and 
sees, 
estimates, 
measures, 
and 
judges 
from 
the 
outside, 
not 
the 
inside: 
what 
is 
much 
more 
essential 
is 
that 
the 
exoteric 
approach 
sees 
things 
from 
below, 
the 
esoteric 
looks 
down 
from 
above. 
There 
are 
heights 
of 
the 
soul 
from 
which 
even 
tragedy 
ceases 
to 
look 
tragic; 
and 
rolling 
together 
all 
the 
woe 
of 
the 
world—who 
could 
dare 
to 
decide 
whether 
its 
sight 
would 
necessarily 
seduce 
us 
and 
compel 
us 
to 
feel 
pity 
and 
thus 
double 
this 
woe? 


What 
serves 
the 
higher 
type 
of 
men 
as 
nourishment 
or 
delectation 
must 
almost 
be 
poison 
for 
a 
very 
different 
and 
inferior 
type. 
The 
virtues 
of 
the 
common 
man 
might 
perhaps 
signify 
vices 
and 
weaknesses 
in 
a 
philosopher. 
It 
could 
be 
possible 
that 
a 
man 
of 
a 
high 
type, 
when 
degenerating 
and 
perishing, 
might 
only 
at 
that 
point 
acquire 
qualities 
that 
would 
require 
those 
in 
the 
lower 
sphere 
into 
which 
he 
had 
sunk 
to 
begin 
to 
venerate 
him 
like 
a 
saint. 
There 
are 
books 
that 
have 
opposite 
values 
for 
soul 
and 
health, 
depending 
on 
whether 
the 
lower 
soul, 
the 
lower 
vitality, 
or 
the 
higher 
and 
more 
vigorous 
ones 
turn 
to 
them: 
in 
the 
former 
case, 
these 
books 
are 
dangerous 
and 
lead 
to 
crumbling 
and 
disintegration; 
in 
the 
latter, 
heralds’ 
cries 
that 
call 
the 
bravest 
to 
their 
courage. 
Books 
for 
all 
the 
world 
are 
always 
foul-smelling 
books: 
the 
smell 
of 
small 
people 
clings 
to 
them. 
Where 
the 
people 
eat 
and 
drink, 
even 
where 
they 
venerate, 
it 
usually 
stinks. 
One 
should 
not 
go 
to 
church 
if 
one 
wants 
to 
breathe 
pure 
air. 



31 


When 
one 
is 
young, 
one 
venerates 
and 
despises 
without 
that 
art 
of 
nuances 
which 
constitutes 
the 
best 
gain 
of 
life, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
fair 
that 
one 
has 
to 
pay 
dearly 
for 
having 
assaulted 
men 
and 
things 
in 
this 
manner 
with 
Yes 
and 
No. 
Everything 
is 
arranged 
so 
that 
the 
worst 
of 
tastes, 
the 
taste 
for 
the 
unconditional, 
should 
be 
cruelly 
fooled 
and 
abused 
until 
a 
man 
learns 
to 
put 
a 
little 
art 
into 
his 
feelings 
and 
rather 
to 
risk 
trying 
even 
what 
is 
artificial—as 
the 
real 
artists 
of 
life 
do. 


The 
wrathful 
and 
reverent 
attitudes 
characteristic 
of 
youth 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
permit 
themselves 
any 
rest 
until 
they 
have 
forged 
men 
and 
things 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
these 
attitudes 
may 
be 
vented 
on 
them—after 
all, 
youth 
in 
itself 
has 
something 
of 
forgery 
and 
deception. 
Later, 
when 
the 
young 
soul, 
tortured 
by 
all 
kinds 
of 
disappointments, 
finally 
turns 
suspiciously 
against 
itself, 
still 
hot 
and 
wild, 
even 
in 
its 
suspicion 
and 
pangs 
of 
conscience—how 
wroth 
it 
is 
with 
itself 
now! 
how 
it 
tears 
itself 
to 
pieces, 
impatiently! 
how 
it 
takes 
revenge 
for 
its 
long 
self-delusion, 
just 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
a 
deliberate 
blindness! 
In 
this 
transition 
one 
punishes 
oneself 
with 
mistrust 
against 
one’s 
own 
feelings; 
one 
tortures 
one’s 
own 
enthusiasm 
with 
doubts; 
indeed, 
one 
experiences 
even 
a 
good 
conscience 
as 
a 
danger, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
way 
of 
wrapping 
oneself 
in 
veils 
and 
the 
exhaustion 
of 
subtler 
honesty—and 
above 
all 
one 
takes 
sides, 
takes 
sides 
on 
principle, 
against 
“youth.”— 
Ten 
years 
later 
one 
comprehends 
that 
all 
this, 
too—was 
still 
youth. 



32 


During 
the 
longest 
part 
of 
human 
history—so-called 
prehistorical 
times— 
the 
value 
or 
disvalue 
of 
an 
action 
was 
derived 
from 
its 
consequences. 
The 
action 
itself 
was 
considered 
as 
little 
as 
its 
origin. 
It 
was 
rather 
the 
way 
a 
distinction 
or 
disgrace 
still 
reaches 
back 
today 
from 
a 
child 
to 
its 
parents, 
in 
China: 
it 
was 
the 
retroactive 
force 
of 
success 
or 
failure 
that 
led 
men 
to 
think 
well 
or 
ill 
of 
an 
action. 
Let 
us 
call 
this 
period 
the 
pre-moral 
period 
of 
mankind: 
the 
imperative 
“know 
thyself!” 
was 
as 
yet 
unknown. 


In 
the 
last 
ten 
thousand 
years, 
however, 
one 
has 
reached 
the 
point, 
step 
by 
step, 
in 
a 
few 
large 
regions 
on 
the 
earth, 
where 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
consequences 
but 
the 
origin 
of 
an 
action 
that 
one 
allows 
to 
decide 
its 
value. 
On 
the 
whole 
this 
is 
a 
great 
event 
which 
involves 
a 
considerable 
refinement 
of 
vision 
and 
standards; 
it 
is 
the 
unconscious 
aftereffect 
of 
the 
rule 
of 
aristocratic 
values 
and 
the 
faith 
in 
“descent”—the 
sign 
of 
a 
period 
that 
one 
may 
call 
moral 
in 
the 
narrower 
sense. 
It 
involves 
the 
first 
attempt 
at 
self-
knowledge. 
Instead 
of 
the 
consequences, 
the 
origin: 
indeed 
a 
reversal 
of 
perspective! 
Surely, 
a 
reversal 
achieved 
only 
after 
long 
struggles 
and 
vacillations. 
To 
be 
sure, 
a 
calamitous 
new 
superstition, 
an 
odd 
narrowness 
of 
interpretation, 
thus 
become 
dominant: 
the 
origin 
of 
an 
action 
was 
interpreted 
in 
the 
most 
definite 
sense 
as 
origin 
in 
an 
intention; 
one 
came 
to 
agree 
that 
the 
value 
of 
an 
action 
lay 
in 
the 
value 
of 
the 
intention. 
The 
intention 
as 
the 
whole 
origin 
and 
prehistory 
of 
an 
action—almost 
to 
the 
present 
day 
this 
prejudice 
dominated 
moral 
praise, 
blame, 
judgment, 
and 
philosophy 
on 
earth. 


But 
today—shouldn’t 
we 
have 
reached 
the 
necessity 
of 
once 
more 
resolving 
on 
a 
reversal 
and 
fundamental 
shift 
in 
values, 
owing 
to 
another 
self-
examination 
of 
man, 
another 
growth 
in 
profundity? 
Don’t 
we 
stand 
at 
the 
threshold 
of 
a 
period 
which 
should 
be 
designated 
negatively, 
to 
begin 
with, 
as 
extra-moral? 
After 
all, 
today 
at 
least 
we 
immoralists 
have 
the 
suspicion 
that 
the 
decisive 
value 
of 
an 
action 
lies 
precisely 
in 
what 
is 
unintentional 
in 
it, 
while 
everything 
about 
it 
that 
is 
intentional, 
everything 
about 
it 
that 
can 
be 
seen, 
known, 
“conscious,” 
still 
belongs 
to 
its 
surface 
and 
skin—which, 
like 
every 
skin, 
betrays 
something 
but 
conceals 
even 
more. 
In 
short, 
we 
believe 
that 
the 
intention 
is 
merely 
a 
sign 
and 
symptom 
that 
still 
requires 



interpretation—moreover, 
a 
sign 
that 
means 
too 
much 
and 
therefore, 
taken 
by 
itself 
alone, 
almost 
nothing. 
We 
believe 
that 
morality 
in 
the 
traditional 
sense, 
the 
morality 
of 
intentions, 
was 
a 
prejudice, 
precipitate 
and 
perhaps 
provisional—something 
on 
the 
order 
of 
astrology 
and 
alchemy—but 
in 
any 
case 
something 
that 
must 
be 
overcome. 
The 
overcoming 
of 
morality, 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
even 
the 
self-overcoming 
of 
morality—let 
this 
be 
the 
name 
for 
that 
long 
secret 
work 
which 
has 
been 
saved 
up 
for 
the 
finest 
and 
most 
honest, 
also 
the 
most 
malicious, 
consciences 
of 
today, 
as 
living 
touchstones 
of 
the 
soul. 



33 


There 
is 
no 
other 
way: 
the 
feelings 
of 
devotion, 
self-sacrifice 
for 
one’s 
neighbor, 
the 
whole 
morality 
of 
self-denial 
must 
be 
questioned 
mercilessly 
and 
taken 
to 
court—no 
less 
than 
the 
aesthetics 
of 
“contemplation 
devoid 
of 
all 
interest” 
which 
is 
used 
today 
as 
a 
seductive 
guise 
for 
the 
emasculation 
of 
art, 
to 
give 
it 
a 
good 
conscience. 
There 
is 
too 
much 
charm 
and 
sugar 
in 
these 
feelings 
of 
“for 
others,” 
“not 
for 
myself,” 
for 
us 
not 
to 
need 
to 
become 
doubly 
suspicious 
at 
this 
point 
and 
to 
ask: 
“are 
these 
not 
perhaps— 
seductions?” 


That 
they 
please—those 
who 
have 
them 
and 
those 
who 
enjoy 
their 
fruits, 
and 
also 
the 
mere 
spectator—this 
does 
not 
yet 
constitute 
an 
argument 
in 
their 
favor 
but 
rather 
invites 
caution. 
So 
let 
us 
be 
cautious. 



34 


Whatever 
philosophical 
standpoint 
one 
may 
adopt 
today, 
from 
every 
point 
of 
view 
the 
erroneousness 
of 
the 
world 
in 
which 
we 
think 
we 
live 
is 
the 
surest 
and 
firmest 
fact 
that 
we 
can 
lay 
eyes 
on: 
we 
find 
reasons 
upon 
reasons 
for 
it 
which 
would 
like 
to 
lure 
us 
to 
hypotheses 
concerning 
a 
deceptive 
principle 
in 
“the 
essence 
of 
things.” 
But 
whoever 
holds 
our 
thinking 
itself, 
“the 
spirit,” 
in 
other 
words, 
responsible 
for 
the 
falseness 
of 
the 
world—an 
honorable 
way 
out 
which 
is 
chosen 
by 
every 
conscious 
or 
unconscious 
advocatus 
dei16—whoever 
takes 
this 
world, 
along 
with 
space, 
time, 
form, 
movement, 
to 
be 
falsely 
inferred—anyone 
like 
that 
would 
at 
least 
have 
ample 
reason 
to 
learn 
to 
be 
suspicious 
at 
long 
last 
of 
all 
thinking. 
Wouldn’t 
thinking 
have 
put 
over 
on 
us 
the 
biggest 
hoax 
yet? 
And 
what 
warrant 
would 
there 
be 
that 
it 
would 
not 
continue 
to 
do 
what 
it 
has 
always 
done? 


In 
all 
seriousness: 
the 
innocence 
of 
our 
thinkers 
is 
somehow 
touching 
and 
evokes 
reverence, 
when 
today 
they 
still 
step 
before 
consciousness 
with 
the 
request 
that 
it 
should 
please 
give 
them 
honest 
answers; 
for 
example, 
whether 
it 
is 
“real,” 
and 
why 
it 
so 
resolutely 
keeps 
the 
external 
world 
at 
a 
distance, 
and 
other 
questions 
of 
that 
kind. 
The 
faith 
in 
“immediate 
certainties” 
is 
a 
moral 
naïveté 
that 
reflects 
honor 
on 
us 
philosophers; 
but—after 
all 
we 
should 
not 
be 
“merely 
moral” 
men. 
Apart 
from 
morality, 
this 
faith 
is 
a 
stupidity 
that 
reflects 
little 
honor 
on 
us. 
In 
bourgeois 
life 
ever-present 
suspicion 
may 
be 
considered 
a 
sign 
of 
“bad 
character” 
and 
hence 
belong 
among 
things 
imprudent; 
here, 
among 
us, 
beyond 
the 
bourgeois 
world 
and 
its 
Yes 
and 
No 
—what 
should 
prevent 
us 
from 
being 
imprudent 
and 
saying: 
a 
philosopher 
has 
nothing 
less 
than 
a 
right 
to 
“bad 
character,” 
as 
the 
being 
who 
has 
so 
far 
always 
been 
fooled 
best 
on 
earth; 
he 
has 
a 
duty 
to 
suspicion 
today, 
to 
squint 
maliciously 
out 
of 
every 
abyss 
of 
suspicion. 


Forgive 
me 
the 
joke 
of 
this 
gloomy 
grimace 
and 
trope; 
for 
I 
myself 
have 
learned 
long 
ago 
to 
think 
differently, 
to 
estimate 
differently 
with 
regard 
to 
deceiving 
and 
being 
deceived, 
and 
I 
keep 
in 
reserve 
at 
least 
a 
couple 
of 
jostles 
for 
the 
blind 
rage 
with 
which 
the 
philosophers 
resist 
being 
deceived. 
Why 
not? 
It 
is 
no 
more 
than 
a 
moral 
prejudice 
that 
truth 
is 
worth 
more 
than 



mere 
appearance; 
it 
is 
even 
the 
worst 
proved 
assumption 
there 
is 
in 
the 
world. 
Let 
at 
least 
this 
much 
be 
admitted: 
there 
would 
be 
no 
life 
at 
all 
if 
not 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
perspective 
estimates 
and 
appearances; 
and 
if, 
with 
the 
virtuous 
enthusiasm 
and 
clumsiness 
of 
some 
philosophers, 
one 
wanted 
to 
abolish 
the 
“apparent 
world” 
altogether—well, 
supposing 
you 
could 
do 
that, 
at 
least 
nothing 
would 
be 
left 
of 
your 
“truth” 
either. 
Indeed, 
what 
forces 
us 
at 
all 
to 
suppose 
that 
there 
is 
an 
essential 
opposition 
of 
“true” 
and 
“false”? 
Is 
it 
not 
sufficient 
to 
assume 
degrees 
of 
apparentness 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
lighter 
and 
darker 
shadows 
and 
shades 
of 
appearance—different 
“values,” 
to 
use 
the 
language 
of 
painters? 
Why 
couldn’t 
the 
world 
that 
concerns 
us—be 
a 
fiction? 
And 
if 
somebody 
asked, 
“but 
to 
a 
fiction 
there 
surely 
belongs 
an 
author?”— 
couldn’t 
one 
answer 
simply: 
why? 
Doesn’t 
this 
“belongs” 
perhaps 
belong 
to 
the 
fiction, 
too? 
Is 
it 
not 
permitted 
to 
be 
a 
bit 
ironical 
about 
the 
subject 
no 
less 
than 
the 
predicate 
and 
object? 
Shouldn’t 
philosophers 
be 
permitted 
to 
rise 
above 
faith 
in 
grammar? 
All 
due 
respect 
for 
governesses—but 
hasn’t 
the 
time 
come 
for 
philosophy 
to 
renounce 
the 
faith 
of 
governesses?17 



35 


O 
Voltaire! 
O 
humaneness! 
O 
nonsense! 
There 
is 
something 
about 
“truth,” 
about 
the 
search 
for 
truth; 
and 
when 
a 
human 
being 
is 
too 
human 
about 
it 
—“il 
ne 
cherche 
le 
vrai 
que 
pour 
faire 
le 
bien”18—I 
bet 
he 
finds 
nothing. 



36 


Suppose 
nothing 
else 
were 
“given” 
as 
real 
except 
our 
world 
of 
desires 
and 
passions, 
and 
we 
could 
not 
get 
down, 
or 
up, 
to 
any 
other 
“reality” 
besides 
the 
reality 
of 
our 
drives—for 
thinking 
is 
merely 
a 
relation 
of 
these 
drives 
to 
each 
other: 
is 
it 
not 
permitted 
to 
make 
the 
experiment 
and 
to 
ask 
the 
question 
whether 
this 
“given” 
would 
not 
be 
sufficient 
for 
also 
understanding 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
thing 
the 
so-called 
mechanistic 
(or 
“material”) 
world? 
I 
mean, 
not 
as 
a 
deception, 
as 
“mere 
appearance,” 
an 
“idea” 
(in 
the 
sense 
of 
Berkeley 
and 
Schopenhauer) 
but 
as 
holding 
the 
same 
rank 
of 
reality 
as 
our 
affect—as 
a 
more 
primitive 
form 
of 
the 
world 
of 
affects 
in 
which 
everything 
still 
lies 
contained 
in 
a 
powerful 
unity 
before 
it 
undergoes 
ramifications 
and 
developments 
in 
the 
organic 
process 
(and, 
as 
is 
only 
fair, 
also 
becomes 
tenderer 
and 
weaker)—as 
a 
kind 
of 
instinctive 
life 
in 
which 
all 
organic 
functions 
are 
still 
synthetically 
intertwined 
along 
with 
self-regulation, 
assimilation, 
nourishment, 
excretion, 
and 
metabolism—as 
a 
pre-form 
of 
life. 


In 
the 
end 
not 
only 
is 
it 
permitted 
to 
make 
this 
experiment; 
the 
conscience 
of 
method 
demands 
it. 
Not 
to 
assume 
several 
kinds 
of 
causality 
until 
the 
experiment 
of 
making 
do 
with 
a 
single 
one 
has 
been 
pushed 
to 
its 
utmost 
limit 
(to 
the 
point 
of 
nonsense, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so)—that 
is 
a 
moral 
of 
method 
which 
one 
may 
not 
shirk 
today—it 
follows 
“from 
its 
definition,” 
as 
a 
mathematician 
would 
say. 
The 
question 
is 
in 
the 
end 
whether 
we 
really 
recognize 
the 
will 
as 
efficient, 
whether 
we 
believe 
in 
the 
causality 
of 
the 
will: 
if 
we 
do—and 
at 
bottom 
our 
faith 
in 
this 
is 
nothing 
less 
than 
our 
faith 
in 
causality 
itself—then 
we 
have 
to 
make 
the 
experiment 
of 
positing 
the 
causality 
of 
the 
will 
hypothetically 
as 
the 
only 
one. 
“Will,” 
of 
course, 
can 
affect 
only 
“will”—and 
not 
“matter” 
(not 
“nerves,” 
for 
example). 
In 
short, 
one 
has 
to 
risk 
the 
hypothesis 
whether 
will 
does 
not 
affect 
will 
wherever 
“effects” 
are 
recognized—and 
whether 
all 
mechanical 
occurrences 
are 
not, 
insofar 
as 
a 
force 
is 
active 
in 
them, 
will 
force, 
effects 
of 
will. 


Suppose, 
finally, 
we 
succeeded 
in 
explaining 
our 
entire 
instinctive 
life 
as 
the 
development 
and 
ramification 
of 
one 
basic 
form 
of 
the 
will—namely, 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
as 
my 
proposition 
has 
it; 
suppose 
all 
organic 
functions 
could 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
this 
will 
to 
power 
and 
one 
could 
also 
find 
in 
it 
the 



solution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
procreation 
and 
nourishment—it 
is 
one 
problem— 
then 
one 
would 
have 
gained 
the 
right 
to 
determine 
all 
efficient 
force 
univocally 
as—will 
to 
power. 
The 
world 
viewed 
from 
inside, 
the 
world 
defined 
and 
determined 
according 
to 
its 
“intelligible 
character”—it 
would 
be 
“will 
to 
power” 
and 
nothing 
else.—

“What? 
Doesn’t 
this 
mean, 
to 
speak 
with 
the 
vulgar: 
God 
is 
refuted, 
but 
the 
devil 
is 
not?” 
On 
the 
contrary! 
On 
the 
contrary, 
my 
friends. 
And, 
the 
devil— 
who 
forces 
you 
to 
speak 
with 
the 
vulgar? 



38 


What 
happened 
most 
recently 
in 
the 
broad 
daylight 
of 
modern 
times 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
French 
Revolution—that 
gruesome 
farce 
which, 
considered 
closely, 
was 
quite 
superfluous, 
though 
noble 
and 
enthusiastic 
spectators 
from 
all 
over 
Europe 
contemplated 
it 
from 
a 
distance 
and 
interpreted 
it 
according 
to 
their 
own 
indignations 
and 
enthusiasms 
for 
so 
long, 
and 
so 
passionately, 
that 
the 
text 
finally 
disappeared 
under 
the 
interpretation—could 
happen 
once 
more 
as 
a 
noble 
posterity 
might 
misunderstand 
the 
whole 
past 
and 
in 
that 
way 
alone 
make 
it 
tolerable 
to 
look 
at. 


Or 
rather: 
isn’t 
this 
what 
has 
happened 
even 
now? 
haven’t 
we 
ourselves 
been 
this 
“noble 
posterity”? 
And 
isn’t 
now 
precisely 
the 
moment 
when, 
insofar 
as 
we 
comprehend 
this, 
it 
is 
all 
over? 



39 


Nobody 
is 
very 
likely 
to 
consider 
a 
doctrine 
true 
merely 
because 
it 
makes 
people 
happy 
or 
virtuous—except 
perhaps 
the 
lovely 
“idealists” 
who 
become 
effusive 
about 
the 
good, 
the 
true, 
and 
the 
beautiful 
and 
allow 
all 
kinds 
of 
motley, 
clumsy, 
and 
benevolent 
desiderata 
to 
swim 
around 
in 
utter 
confusion 
in 
their 
pond. 
Happiness 
and 
virtue 
are 
no 
arguments. 
But 
people 
like 
to 
forget—even 
sober 
spirits—that 
making 
unhappy 
and 
evil 
are 
no 
counterarguments. 
Something 
might 
be 
true 
while 
being 
harmful 
and 
dangerous 
in 
the 
highest 
degree. 
Indeed, 
it 
might 
be 
a 
basic 
characteristic 
of 
existence 
that 
those 
who 
would 
know 
it 
completely 
would 
perish, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
spirit 
should 
be 
measured 
according 
to 
how 
much 
of 
the 
“truth” 
one 
could 
still 
barely 
endure—or 
to 
put 
it 
more 
clearly, 
to 
what 
degree 
one 
would 
require 
it 
to 
be 
thinned 
down, 
shrouded, 
sweetened, 
blunted, 
falsified.19 


But 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
at 
all 
that 
the 
evil 
and 
unhappy 
are 
more 
favored 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
certain 
parts 
of 
truth, 
and 
that 
the 
probability 
of 
their 
success 
here 
is 
greater—not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
evil 
who 
are 
happy, 
a 
species 
the 
moralists 
bury 
in 
silence. 
Perhaps 
hardness 
and 
cunning 
furnish 
more 
favorable 
conditions 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
strong, 
independent 
spirit 
and 
philosopher 
than 
that 
gentle, 
fine, 
conciliatory 
good-naturedness 
and 
art 
of 
taking 
things 
lightly 
which 
people 
prize, 
and 
prize 
rightly, 
in 
a 
scholar. 
Assuming 
first 
of 
all 
that 
the 
concept 
“philosopher” 
is 
not 
restricted 
to 
the 
philosopher 
who 
writes 
books—or 
makes 
books 
of 
his 
philosophy. 


A 
final 
trait 
for 
the 
image 
of 
the 
free-spirited 
philosopher 
is 
contributed 
by 
Stendhal 
whom, 
considering 
German 
taste, 
I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
fail 
to 
stress—for 
he 
goes 
against 
the 
German 
taste. 
“Pour 
être 
bon 
philosophe,” 
says 
this 
last 
great 
psychologist, 
“il 
faut 
être 
sec, 
clair, 
sans 
illusion. 
Un 
banquier, 
qui 
a 
fait 
fortune, 
a 
une 
partie 
du 
caractère 
requis 
pour 
faire 
des 
découvertes 
en 
philosophie, 
c’est-a-dire 
pour 
voir 
clair 
dans 
ce 
qui 
est.”20

Whatever 
is 
profound 
loves 
masks; 
what 
is 
most 
profound 
even 
hates 
image 
and 
parable. 
Might 
not 
nothing 
less 
than 
the 
opposite 
be 
the 
proper 
disguise 
for 
the 
shame 
of 
a 
god?21 
A 
questionable 
question: 
it 
would 
be 
odd 
if 
some 
mystic 
had 
not 
risked 
something 
to 
that 
effect 
in 
his 
mind. 
There 
are 
occurrences 
of 
such 
a 
delicate 
nature 
that 
one 
does 
well 
to 
cover 
them 
up 
with 
some 
rudeness 
to 
conceal 
them; 
there 
are 
actions 
of 
love 
and 
extravagant 
generosity 
after 
which 
nothing 
is 
more 
advisable 
than 
to 
take 
a 
stick 
and 
give 
any 
eyewitness 
a 
sound 
thrashing: 
that 
would 
muddle 
his 
memory. 
Some 
know 
how 
to 
muddle 
and 
abuse 
their 
own 
memory 
in 
order 
to 
have 
their 
revenge 
at 
least 
against 
this 
only 
witness: 
shame 
is 
inventive. 


It 
is 
not 
the 
worst 
things 
that 
cause 
the 
worst 
shame: 
there 
is 
not 
only 
guile 
behind 
a 
mask—there 
is 
so 
much 
graciousness 
in 
cunning. 
I 
could 
imagine 
that 
a 
human 
being 
who 
had 
to 
guard 
something 
precious 
and 
vulnerable 
might 
roll 
through 
life, 
rude 
and 
round 
as 
an 
old 
green 
wine 
cask 
with 
heavy 
hoops: 
the 
refinement 
of 
his 
shame 
would 
want 
it 
that 
way. 


A 
man 
whose 
sense 
of 
shame 
has 
some 
profundity 
encounters 
his 
destinies 
and 
delicate 
decisions, 
too, 
on 
paths 
which 
few 
ever 
reach 
and 
of 
whose 
mere 
existence 
his 
closest 
intimates 
must 
not 
know: 
his 
mortal 
danger 
is 
Concealed 
from 
their 
eyes, 
and 
so 
is 
his 
regained 
sureness 
of 
life. 
Such 
a 
concealed 
man 
who 
instinctively 
needs 
speech 
for 
silence 
and 
for 
burial 
in 
silence 
and 
who 
is 
inexhaustible 
in 
his 
evasion 
of 
communication, 
wants 
and 
sees 
to 
it 
that 
a 
mask 
of 
him 
roams 
in 
his 
place 
through 
the 
hearts 
and 
heads 
of 
his 
friends. 
And 
supposing 
he 
did 
not 
want 
it, 
he 
would 
still 
realize 
some 
day 
that 
in 
spite 
of 
that 
a 
mask 
of 
him 
is 
there—and 
that 
this 
is 
well. 
Every 
profound 
spirit 
needs 
a 
mask: 
even 
more, 
around 
every 
profound 
spirit 
a 
mask 
is 
growing 
continually, 
owing 
to 
the 
constantly 
false, 
namely 
shallow, 
interpretation 
of 
every 
word, 
every 
step, 
every 
sign 
of 
life 
he 
gives.22—

Karl 
Jaspers 
has 
called 
attention 
to 
the 
similarity 
between 
Nietzsche 
and 
Kierkegaard 
at 
this 
point, 
in 
his 
lecture 
on 
Kierkegaard 
and 
Nietzsche 
(Existentialism 
from 
Dostoevsky 
to 
Sartre, 
ed. 
Kaufmann, 
New 
York, 
Meridian 
Books, 
1956, 
p. 
165). 
See 
also 
Jaspers’ 
Nietzsche 
(1936, 
pp. 
358ff.; 
pp. 
405ff. 
of 
the 
English 
version, 
Tucson, 
University 
of 
Arizona 
Press, 
1965, 
which 
unfortunately 
omits 
the 
references 
for 
the 
quotations). 


One 
has 
to 
test 
oneself 
to 
see 
that 
one 
is 
destined 
for 
independence 
and 
command—and 
do 
it 
at 
the 
right 
time. 
One 
should 
not 
dodge 
one’s 
tests, 
though 
they 
may 
be 
the 
most 
dangerous 
game 
one 
could 
play 
and 
are 
tests 
that 
are 
taken 
in 
the 
end 
before 
no 
witness 
or 
judge 
but 
ourselves. 


Not 
to 
remain 
stuck 
to 
a 
person—not 
even 
the 
most 
loved—every 
person 
is 
a 
prison, 
also 
a 
nook.23 
Not 
to 
remain 
stuck 
to 
a 
fatherland—not 
even 
if 
it 
suffers 
most 
and 
needs 
help 
most—it 
is 
less 
difficult 
to 
sever 
one’s 
heart 
from 
a 
victorious 
fatherland. 
Not 
to 
remain 
stuck 
to 
some 
pity—not 
even 
for 
higher 
men 
into 
whose 
rare 
torture 
and 
helplessness 
some 
accident 
allowed 
us 
to 
look.24 
Not 
to 
remain 
stuck 
to 
a 
science—even 
if 
it 
should 
lure 
us 
with 
the 
most 
precious 
finds 
that 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
saved 
up 
precisely 
for 
us.25 
Not 
to 
remain 
stuck 
to 
one’s 
own 
detachment, 
to 
that 
voluptuous 
remoteness 
and 
strangeness 
of 
the 
bird 
who 
flees 
ever 
higher 
to 
see 
ever 
more 
below 
him 
—the 
danger 
of 
the 
flier. 
Not 
to 
remain 
stuck 
to 
our 
own 
virtues 
and 
become 
as 
a 
whole 
the 
victim 
of 
some 
detail 
in 
us, 
such 
as 
our 
hospitality, 
which 
is 
the 
danger 
of 
dangers 
for 
superior 
and 
rich 
souls 
who 
spend 
themselves 
lavishly, 
almost 
indifferently, 
and 
exaggerate 
the 
virtue 
of 
generosity 
into 
a 
vice. 
One 
must 
know 
how 
to 
conserve 
oneself: 
the 
hardest 
test 
of 
independence. 



42 


A 
new 
species 
of 
philosophers 
is 
coming 
up: 
I 
venture 
to 
baptize 
them 
with 
a 
name 
that 
is 
not 
free 
of 
danger. 
As 
I 
unriddle 
them, 
insofar 
as 
they 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
unriddled—for 
it 
belongs 
to 
their 
nature 
to 
want 
to 
remain 
riddles 
at 
some 
point—these 
philosophers 
of 
the 
future 
may 
have 
a 
right—it 
might 
also 
be 
a 
wrong—to 
be 
called 
attempters.26 
This 
name 
itself 
is 
in 
the 
end 
a 
mere 
attempt 
and, 
if 
you 
will, 
a 
temptation. 



43 


Are 
these 
coming 
philosophers 
new 
friends 
of 
“truth”? 
That 
is 
probable 
enough, 
for 
all 
philosophers 
so 
far 
have 
loved 
their 
truths. 
But 
they 
will 
certainly 
not 
be 
dogmatists. 
It 
must 
offend 
their 
pride, 
also 
their 
taste, 
if 
their 
truth 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
a 
truth 
for 
everyman—which 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
secret 
wish 
and 
hidden 
meaning 
of 
all 
dogmatic 
aspirations. 
“My 
judgment 
is 
my 
judgment”: 
no 
one 
else 
is 
easily 
entitled 
to 
it—that 
is 
what 
such 
a 
philosopher 
of 
the 
future 
may 
perhaps 
say 
of 
himself. 


One 
must 
shed 
the 
bad 
taste 
of 
wanting 
to 
agree 
with 
many. 
“Good” 
is 
no 
longer 
good 
when 
one’s 
neighbor 
mouths 
it. 
And 
how 
should 
there 
be 
a 
“common 
good”! 
The 
term 
contradicts 
itself: 
whatever 
can 
be 
common 
always 
has 
little 
value. 
In 
the 
end 
it 
must 
be 
as 
it 
is 
and 
always 
has 
been: 
great 
things 
remain 
for 
the 
great, 
abysses 
for 
the 
profound, 
nuances 
and 
shudders 
for 
the 
refined, 
and, 
in 
brief, 
all 
that 
is 
rare 
for 
the 
rare.27— 



44 


Need 
I 
still 
say 
expressly 
after 
all 
this 
that 
they, 
too, 
will 
be 
free, 
very 
free 
spirits, 
these 
philosophers 
of 
the 
future—though 
just 
as 
certainly 
they 
will 
not 
be 
merely 
free 
spirits 
but 
something 
more, 
higher, 
greater, 
and 
thoroughly 
different 
that 
does 
not 
want 
to 
be 
misunderstood 
and 
mistaken 
for 
something 
else. 
But 
saying 
this 
I 
feel 
an 
obligation—almost 
as 
much 
to 
them 
as 
to 
ourselves 
who 
are 
their 
heralds 
and 
precursors, 
we 
free 
spirits—to 
sweep 
away 
a 
stupid 
old 
prejudice 
and 
misunderstanding 
about 
the 
lot 
of 
us: 
all 
too 
long 
it 
has 
clouded 
the 
concept 
“free 
spirit” 
like 
a 
fog. 


In 
all 
the 
countries 
of 
Europe, 
and 
in 
America, 
too, 
there 
now 
is 
something 
that 
abuses 
this 
name: 
a 
very 
narrow, 
imprisoned, 
chained 
type 
of 
spirits 
who 
want 
just 
about 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
accords 
with 
our 
intentions 
and 
instincts 
—not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
regarding 
the 
new 
philosophers 
who 
are 
coming 
up 
they 
must 
assuredly 
be 
closed 
windows 
and 
bolted 
doors. 
They 
belong, 
briefly 
and 
sadly, 
among 
the 
levelers—these 
falsely 
so-called 
“free 
spirits”—being 
eloquent 
and 
prolifically 
scribbling 
slaves 
of 
the 
democratic 
taste 
and 
its 
“modern 
ideas”; 
they 
are 
all 
human 
beings 
without 
solitude, 
without 
their 
own 
solitude, 
clumsy 
good 
fellows 
whom 
one 
should 
not 
deny 
either 
courage 
or 
respectable 
decency—only 
they 
are 
unfree 
and 
ridiculously 
superficial, 
above 
all 
in 
their 
basic 
inclination 
to 
find 
in 
the 
forms 
of 
the 
old 
society 
as 
it 
has 
existed 
so 
far 
just 
about 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
human 
misery 
and 
failure—which 
is 
a 
way 
of 
standing 
truth 
happily 
upon 
her 
head! 
What 
they 
would 
like 
to 
strive 
for 
with 
all 
their 
powers 
is 
the 
universal 
green-pasture 
happiness 
of 
the 
herd, 
with 
security, 
lack 
of 
danger, 
comfort, 
and 
an 
easier 
life 
for 
everyone; 
the 
two 
songs 
and 
doctrines 
which 
they 
repeat 
most 
often 
are 
“equality 
of 
rights” 
and 
“sympathy 
for 
all 
that 
suffers”—and 
suffering 
itself 
they 
take 
for 
something 
that 
must 
be 
abolished. 


We 
opposite 
men, 
having 
opened 
our 
eyes 
and 
conscience 
to 
the 
question 
where 
and 
how 
the 
plant 
“man” 
has 
so 
far 
grown 
most 
vigorously 
to 
a 
height 
—we 
think 
that 
this 
has 
happened 
every 
time 
under 
the 
opposite 
conditions, 
that 
to 
this 
end 
the 
dangerousness 
of 
his 
situation 
must 
first 
grow 
to 
the 
point 
of 
enormity, 
his 
power 
of 
invention 
and 
simulation 
(his 
“spirit”) 
had 
to 
develop 
under 
prolonged 
pressure 
and 
constraint 
into 
refinement 
and 



audacity, 
his 
life-will 
had 
to 
be 
enhanced 
into 
an 
unconditional 
power-will. 
We 
think 
that 
hardness, 
forcefulness, 
slavery, 
danger 
in 
the 
alley 
and 
the 
heart, 
life 
in 
hiding, 
stoicism, 
the 
art 
of 
experiment 
and 
devilry 
of 
every 
kind, 
that 
everything 
evil, 
terrible, 
tyrannical 
in 
man, 
everything 
in 
him 
that 
is 
kin 
to 
beasts 
of 
prey 
and 
serpents, 
serves 
the 
enhancement 
of 
the 
species 
“man” 
as 
much 
as 
its 
opposite 
does. 
Indeed, 
we 
do 
not 
even 
say 
enough 
when 
we 
say 
only 
that 
much; 
and 
at 
any 
rate 
we 
are 
at 
this 
point, 
in 
what 
we 
say 
and 
keep 
silent 
about, 
at 
the 
other 
end 
from 
all 
modern 
ideology 
and 
herd 
desiderata—as 
their 
antipodes 
perhaps? 


Is 
it 
any 
wonder 
that 
we 
“free 
spirits” 
are 
not 
exactly 
the 
most 
communicative 
spirits? 
that 
we 
do 
not 
want 
to 
betray 
in 
every 
particular 
from 
what 
a 
spirit 
can 
liberate 
himself 
and 
to 
what 
he 
may 
then 
be 
driven? 
And 
as 
for 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
dangerous 
formula 
“beyond 
good 
and 
evil,” 
with 
which 
we 
at 
least 
guard 
against 
being 
mistaken 
for 
others: 
we 
are 
something 
different 
from 
“librespenseurs,” 
“liberi 
pensatori,” 
“Freidenker,”28 
and 
whatever 
else 
all 
these 
goodly 
advocates 
of 
“modern 
ideas” 
like 
to 
call 
themselves. 


At 
home, 
or 
at 
least 
having 
been 
guests, 
in 
many 
countries 
of 
the 
spirit; 
having 
escaped 
again 
and 
again 
from 
the 
musty 
agreeable 
nooks 
into 
which 
preference 
and 
prejudice, 
youth, 
origin, 
the 
accidents 
of 
people 
and 
books 
or 
even 
exhaustion 
from 
wandering 
seemed 
to 
have 
banished 
us; 
full 
of 
malice 
against 
the 
lures 
of 
dependence 
that 
lie 
hidden 
in 
honors, 
or 
money, 
or 
offices, 
or 
enthusiasms 
of 
the 
senses; 
grateful 
even 
to 
need 
and 
vacillating 
sickness 
because 
they 
always 
rid 
us 
from 
some 
rule 
and 
its 
“prejudice,” 
grateful 
to 
god, 
devil, 
sheep, 
and 
worm 
in 
us; 
curious 
to 
a 
vice, 
investigators 
to 
the 
point 
of 
cruelty, 
with 
uninhibited 
fingers 
for 
the 
unfathomable, 
with 
teeth 
and 
stomachs 
for 
the 
most 
indigestible, 
ready 
for 
every 
feat 
that 
requires 
a 
sense 
of 
acuteness 
and 
acute 
senses, 
ready 
for 
every 
venture, 
thanks 
to 
an 
excess 
of 
“free 
will,” 
with 
fore-and 
back-souls 
into 
whose 
ultimate 
intentions 
nobody 
can 
look 
so 
easily, 
with 
fore-and 
backgrounds 
which 
no 
foot 
is 
likely 
to 
explore 
to 
the 
end; 
concealed 
under 
cloaks 
of 
light, 
conquerors 
even 
if 
we 
look 
like 
heirs 
and 
prodigals, 
arrangers 
and 
collectors 
from 
morning 
till 
late, 
misers 
of 
our 
riches 
and 
our 
crammed 
drawers, 
economical 
in 
learning 
and 
forgetting, 
inventive 
in 
schemas, 
occasionally 
proud 
of 
tables 
of 
categories, 
occasionally 
pedants, 
occasionally 
night 
owls 
of 
work 
even 
in 
broad 
daylight; 
yes, 
when 
it 
is 
necessary 
even 
scarecrows— 
and 
today 
it 
is 
necessary; 
namely, 
insofar 
as 
we 
are 
born, 
sworn, 
jealous 



friends 
of 
solitude, 
of 
our 
own 
most 
profound, 
most 
midnightly, 
most 
middaily 
solitude: 
that 
is 
the 
type 
of 
man 
we 
are, 
we 
free 
spirits! 
And 
perhaps 
you 
have 
something 
of 
this, 
too, 
you 
that 
are 
coming? 
you 
new 
philosophers? 
— 


1 
Holy 
simplicity!

Compare 
Nietzsche’s 
splendid 
formulation 
in 
a 
note 
of 
the 
1880’s: 
“A 
very 
popular 
error: 
having 
the 
courage 
of 
one’s 
convictions; 
rather 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
having 
the 
courage 
for 
an 
attack 
on 
one’s 
convictions!!!” 
(Werke, 
Musarion 
edition, 
Munich, 
1920-29, 
XVI, 
p. 
318.

Feinheit 
(subtlety) 
can 
also 
mean 
fineness 
or, 
depending 
on 
the 
context, 
delicacy, 
sensitivity, 
nicety, 
elegance, 
purity. 
In 
this 
translation 
it 
has 
been 
generally 
rendered 
as 
“subtlety” 
and 
sometimes 
as 
“refinement.”

Abbé 
Ferdinand 
Galiani 
(1728-87) 
is 
characterized 
in 
The 
Oxford 
Companion 
to 
French 
Literature 
(Oxford, 
Clarendon 
Press, 
1959) 
as 
“a 
Neapolitan, 
of 
diminutive 
size, 
secretary 
at 
the 
embassy 
in 
Paris 
from 
1759 
… 
of 
considerable 
learning 
and 
originality 
of 
views, 
somewhat 
of 
a 
buffoon, 
much 
appreciated 
in 
the 
literary 
and 
philosophical 
society 
of 
the 
day 
… 
His 
Dialogues 
sur 
les 
blés, 
a 
work 
remarkable 
for 
lively 
wit 
as 
well 
as 
force 
of 
argument, 
combating 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
more 
extreme 
physiocrats, 
appeared 
in 
1770, 
after 
his 
departure 
from 
Paris 
in 
1769.” 
His 
letters 
to 
Mme 
d’Épinay, 
Mme 
Geoffrin, 
and 
Mme 
Necker 
have 
also 
been 
published.

In 
the 
original 
edition:

Although 
the 
second 
“o” 
is 
clearly 
a 
misprint, 
it 
has 
not 
been 
corrected 
in 
later 
editions 
or 
in 
the 
English 
translations. 
Gati 
means 
gait; 
srota, 
the 
current 
of 
a 
river, 
and 
ganga 
is 
the 
river 
Ganges. 
So 
the 
word 
means: 
as 
the 
current 
of 
the 
Ganges 
moves.

in

Cf.: 
“It 
might 
be 
amusing, 
perhaps 
even 
instructive, 
to 
compare 
Ryle 
on 
ordinary 
language 
with 
W. 
D. 
Ross 
on 
prima 
facie 
duties. 
There 
is 
a 
close 
resemblance 
between 
Oxford 
deontology 
and 
Oxford 
linguisticism, 
not 
least 
in 
the 
assumption 
that 
duties, 
like 
verbal 
habits, 
are 
‘learnt 
in 
the 
nursery’ 
[Ryle’s 
phrase], 
and 
that 
what 
nurse 
has 
told 
us 
goes 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world, 
too” 
(John 
Passmore. 
“Professor 
Ryle’s 
Use 
of 
‘Use’ 
and 
‘Usage,’

“He 
seeks 
the 
true 
only 
to 
do 
the 
good.” 


19 
This 
is 
relevant 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
conception 
of 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
and 
the 
themes 
of 
Part 
IX 
below. 


20 
“To 
be 
a 
good 
philosopher, 
one 
must 
be 
dry, 
clear, 
without 
illusion. 
A 
banker 
who 
has 
made 
a 
fortune 
has 
one 
character 
trait 
that 
is 
needed 
for 
making 
discoveries 
in 
philosophy, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
for 
seeing 
clearly 
into 
what 
is.” 


21 
Cf. 
section 
30 
above. 


22 
This 
section 
is 
obviously 
of 
great 
importance 
for 
the 
student 
of 
Nietzsche: 
it 
suggests 
plainly 
that 
the 
surface 
meaning 
noted 
by 
superficial 
browsers 
often 
masks 
Nietzsche’s 
real 
meaning, 
which 
in 
extreme 
cases 
may 
approximate 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
the 
words 
might 
suggest 
to 
hasty 
readers. 
In 
this 
sense 
“beyond 
good 
and 
evil” 
and 
“will 
to 
power,” 
“master 
morality” 
and 
“hardness” 
and 
“cruelty” 
may 
be 
masks 
that 
elicit 
reactions 
quite 
inappropriate 
to 
what 
lies 
behind 
them. 
Specific 
examples 
will 
be 
found 
on 
later 
pages. 


23 
Winkel 
has 
been 
translated 
here 
and 
elsewhere 
as 
“nook”; 
but 
it 
can 
also 
mean 
angle, 
which 
would 
make 
sense 
here 
though 
not 
in 
many 



of 
the 
other 
passages. 


24 
This 
might 
be 
an 
allusion 
to 
Richard 
Wagner; 
but 
this 
is 
a 
point 
Nietzsche 
considered 
important 
generally, 
and 
it 
is 
developed 
at 
length 
in 
Part 
IV 
of 
Zarathustra. 


25 
In 
German 
usage, 
classical 
philology, 
which 
Nietzsche 
had 
given 
up 
in 
order 
to 
devote 
himself 
entirely 
to 
his 
own 
writing, 
is 
a 
science. 


26 
Versucher 
could 
also 
mean 
tempters 
(which 
does 
not 
seem 
intended 
here, 
at 
least 
as 
the 
primary 
meaning) 
or 
experimenters 
(which 
is 
meant 
but 
would 
spoil 
the 
triple 
play 
on 
words): 
Versuch 
(attempt 
or 
experiment) 
and 
Versuchung 
(temptation). 
For 
some 
discussion 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
“experimentalism” 
see 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
2, 
section 
III. 
See 
also 
section 
210 
below. 


27 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
compare 
this 
critique 
of 
dogmatism 
with 
Hegel’s. 
Hegel 
had 
insisted 
that 
dogmatism 
is 
wrong 
in 
supposing 
that 
an 
isolated 
proposition 
can 
be 
the 
form 
of 
the 
truth; 
nothing 
is 
accomplished 
by 
repeating 
such 
formulations: 
their 
significance 
depends 
on 
the 
meaning 
assigned 
to 
the 
terms 
and 
on 
the 
context; 
hence 
only 
the 
system 
can 
be 
the 
form 
of 
the 
truth. 
For 
a 
comparison 
of 
Hegel’s 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
views 
of 
systems 
see 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
2, 
section 
II; 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
chapter 
deals 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
“experimentalism” 
and 
its 
“existential” 
quality.

WHAT

Part 
Three

The 
human 
soul 
and 
its 
limits, 
the 
range 
of 
inner 
human 
experiences 
reached 
so 
far, 
the 
heights, 
depths, 
and 
distances 
of 
these 
experiences, 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
the 
soul 
so 
far 
and 
its 
as 
yet 
unexhausted 
possibilities—that 
is 
the 
predestined 
hunting 
ground 
for 
a 
born 
psychologist 
and 
lover 
of 
the 
“great 
hunt.” 
But 
how 
often 
he 
has 
to 
say 
to 
himself 
in 
despair: 
“One 
hunter! 
alas, 
only 
a 
single 
one! 
and 
look 
at 
this 
huge 
forest, 
this 
primeval 
forest!” 
And 
then 
he 
wishes 
he 
had 
a 
few 
hundred 
helpers 
and 
good, 
well-trained 
hounds 
that 
he 
could 
drive 
into 
the 
history 
of 
the 
human 
soul 
to 
round 
up 
his 
game. 
In 
vain: 
it 
is 
proved 
to 
him 
again 
and 
again, 
thoroughly 
and 
bitterly, 
how 
helpers 
and 
hounds 
for 
all 
the 
things 
that 
excite 
his 
curiosity 
cannot 
be 
found. 
What 
is 
wrong 
with 
sending 
scholars 
into 
new 
and 
dangerous 
hunting 
grounds, 
where 
courage, 
sense, 
and 
subtlety 
in 
every 
way 
are 
required, 
is 
that 
they 
cease 
to 
be 
of 
any 
use 
precisely 
where 
the 
“great 
hunt,” 
but 
also 
the 
great 
danger, 
begins: 
precisely 
there 
they 
lose 
their 
keen 
eye 
and 
nose. 


To 
figure 
out 
and 
determine, 
for 
example, 
what 
kind 
of 
a 
history 
the 
problem 
of 
science 
and 
conscience2 
has 
so 
far 
had 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
homines 
religiosi,3 
one 
might 
perhaps 
have 
to 
be 
as 
profound, 
as 
wounded, 
as 
monstrous 
as 
Pascal’s 
intellectual 
conscience 
was—and 
then 
one 
would 
still 
need 
that 
vaulting 
heaven 
of 
bright, 
malicious 
spirituality 
that 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
surveying 
from 
above, 
arranging, 
and 
forcing 
into 
formulas 
this 
swarm 
of 
dangerous 
and 
painful 
experiences. 


But 
who 
would 
do 
me 
this 
service? 
But 
who 
would 
have 
time 
to 
wait 
for 
such 
servants? 
They 
obviously 
grow 
too 
rarely; 
they 
are 
so 
improbable 
in 
any 
age. 
In 
the 
end 
one 
has 
to 
do 
everything 
oneself 
in 
order 
to 
know 
a 
few 
things 
oneself: 
that 
is, 
one 
has 
a 
lot 
to 
do. 


But 
a 
curiosity 
of 
my 
type 
remains 
after 
all 
the 
most 
agreeable 
of 
all 
vices 
—sorry, 
I 
meant 
to 
say: 
the 
love 
of 
truth 
has 
its 
reward 
in 
heaven 
and 
even 
on 
earth.— 



46 


The 
faith 
demanded, 
and 
not 
infrequently 
attained, 
by 
original 
Christianity, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
skeptical 
and 
southern 
free-spirited 
world 
that 
looked 
back 
on, 
and 
still 
contained, 
a 
centuries-long 
fight 
between 
philosophical 
schools, 
besides 
the 
education 
for 
tolerance 
given 
by 
the 
imperium 
Romanum4—this 
faith 
is 
not 
that 
ingenuous 
and 
bearlike 
subalterns’ 
faith 
with 
which, 
say, 
a 
Luther 
or 
a 
Cromwell, 
or 
some 
other 
northern 
barbarian 
of 
the 
spirit, 
clung 
to 
his 
god 
and 
to 
Christianity. 
It 
is 
much 
closer 
to 
the 
faith 
of 
Pascal, 
which 
resembles 
in 
a 
gruesome 
manner 
a 
continual 
suicide 
of 
reason—a 
tough, 
long-lived, 
wormlike 
reason 
that 
cannot 
be 
killed 
all 
at 
once 
and 
with 
a 
single 
stroke. 


From 
the 
start, 
the 
Christian 
faith 
is 
a 
sacrifice: 
a 
sacrifice 
of 
all 
freedom, 
all 
pride, 
all 
self-confidence 
of 
the 
spirit; 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
enslavement 
and 
self-mockery, 
self-mutilation. 
There 
is 
cruelty 
and 
religious 
Phoenicianism 
in 
this 
faith 
which 
is 
expected 
of 
an 
over-ripe, 
multiple, 
and 
much-spoiled 
conscience: 
it 
presupposes 
that 
the 
subjection 
of 
the 
spirit 
hurts 
indescribably; 
that 
the 
whole 
past 
and 
the 
habits 
of 
such 
a 
spirit 
resist 
the 
absurdissimum5 
which 
“faith” 
represents 
to 
it. 


Modern 
men, 
obtuse 
to 
all 
Christian 
nomenclature, 
no 
longer 
feel 
the 
gruesome 
superlative 
that 
struck 
a 
classical 
taste 
in 
the 
paradoxical 
formula 
“god 
on 
the 
cross.” 
Never 
yet 
and 
nowhere 
has 
there 
been 
an 
equal 
boldness 
in 
inversion, 
anything 
as 
horrible, 
questioning, 
and 
questionable 
as 
this 
formula: 
it 
promised 
a 
revaluation 
of 
all 
the 
values 
of 
antiquity. 


It 
is 
the 
Orient, 
deep 
Orient, 
it 
is 
the 
Oriental 
slave 
who 
revenged 
himself 
in 
this 
way 
on 
Rome 
and 
its 
noble 
and 
frivolous 
tolerance, 
on 
the 
Roman 
“catholicity” 
of 
faith. 
It 
has 
always 
been 
not 
faith 
but 
the 
freedom 
from 
faith, 
that 
half-stoical 
and 
smiling 
unconcern 
with 
the 
seriousness 
of 
faith, 
that 
enraged 
slaves 
in 
their 
masters—against 
their 
masters. 
“Enlightenment” 
enrages: 
for 
the 
slave 
wants 
the 
unconditional; 
he 
understands 
only 
what 
is 
tyrannical, 
in 
morals, 
too; 
he 
loves 
as 
he 
hates, 
without 
nuance, 
to 
the 
depths, 
to 
the 
point 
of 
pain, 
of 
sickness—his 
abundant 
concealed 
suffering 
is 
enraged 
against 
the 
noble 
taste 
that 
seems 
to 
deny 
suffering. 
Nor 
was 
skepticism 



concerning 
suffering, 
at 
bottom 
merely 
a 
pose 
of 
aristocratic 
morality, 
the 
least 
cause 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
last 
great 
slave 
rebellion 
which 
began 
with 
the 
French 
Revolution. 



47 


Wherever 
on 
earth 
the 
religious 
neurosis 
has 
appeared 
we 
find 
it 
tied 
to 
three 
dangerous 
dietary 
demands: 
solitude, 
fasting, 
and 
sexual 
abstinence. 
But 
one 
cannot 
decide 
with 
certainty 
what 
is 
cause 
and 
what 
effect, 
and 
whether 
any 
relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
is 
involved 
here. 
The 
final 
doubt 
seems 
justified 
because 
among 
its 
most 
regular 
symptoms, 
among 
both 
savage 
and 
tame 
peoples, 
we 
also 
find 
the 
most 
sudden, 
most 
extravagant 
voluptuousness 
which 
then, 
just 
as 
suddenly, 
changes 
into 
a 
penitential 
spasm 
and 
denial 
of 
the 
world 
and 
will—both 
perhaps 
to 
be 
interpreted 
as 
masked 
epilepsy? 
But 
nowhere 
should 
one 
resist 
interpretation 
more: 
no 
other 
type 
has 
yet 
been 
surrounded 
by 
such 
a 
lavish 
growth 
of 
nonsense 
and 
superstition, 
no 
other 
type 
seems 
to 
have 
interested 
men, 
even 
philosophers, 
more. 
The 
time 
has 
come 
for 
becoming 
a 
bit 
cold 
right 
here, 
to 
learn 
caution 
—better 
yet: 
to 
look 
away, 
to 
go 
away. 


Even 
in 
the 
background 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
philosophy, 
that 
of 
Schopenhauer, 
we 
find, 
almost 
as 
the 
problem-in-itself, 
this 
gruesome 
question 
mark 
of 
the 
religious 
crisis 
and 
awakening. 
How 
is 
the 
denial 
of 
the 
will 
possible? 
how 
is 
the 
saint 
possible? 
This 
really 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
the 
question 
over 
which 
Schopenhauer 
became 
a 
philosopher 
and 
began. 
And 
so 
it 
was 
a 
genuinely 
Schopenhauerian 
conclusion 
when 
his 
most 
convinced 
adherent 
(perhaps 
also 
the 
last 
one, 
as 
far 
as 
Germany 
is 
concerned), 
namely, 
Richard 
Wagner, 
finished 
his 
life’s 
work 
at 
precisely 
this 
point 
and 
in 
the 
end 
brought 
this 
horrible 
and 
eternal 
type 
on 
the 
stage 
as 
Kundry, 
type 
vécu,6 
in 
the 
flesh—at 
the 
very 
time 
when 
the 
psychiatrists 
of 
almost 
all 
the 
countries 
of 
Europe 
had 
occasion 
to 
study 
it 
at 
close 
quarters, 
wherever 
the 
religious 
neurosis—or 
what 
I 
call 
“das 
religiöse 
Wesen”7—had 
its 
latest 
epidemic 
outbreak 
and 
pageant 
in 
the 
“Salvation 
Army.” 


Let 
us 
ask 
what 
precisely 
about 
this 
whole 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
saint 
has 
seemed 
so 
enormously 
interesting 
to 
men 
of 
all 
types 
and 
ages, 
even 
to 
philosophers. 
Beyond 
any 
doubt, 
it 
was 
the 
air 
of 
the 
miraculous 
that 
goes 
with 
it—namely, 
the 
immediate 
succession 
of 
opposites, 
of 
states 
of 
the 
soul 
that 
are 
judged 
morally 
in 
opposite 
ways. 
It 
seemed 
palpable 
that 
a 
“bad 



man” 
was 
suddenly 
transformed 
into 
a 
“saint,” 
a 
good 
man. 
The 
psychology 
we 
have 
had 
so 
far 
suffered 
shipwreck 
at 
this 
point: 
wasn’t 
this 
chiefly 
because 
it 
had 
placed 
itself 
under 
the 
dominion 
of 
morals, 
because 
it, 
too, 
believed 
in 
opposite 
moral 
values 
and 
saw, 
read, 
interpreted 
these 
opposites 
into 
the 
text 
and 
the 
facts? 


What? 
The 
“miracle” 
merely 
a 
mistake 
of 
interpretation? 
A 
lack 
of 
philology? 



48 


It 
seems 
that 
Catholicism 
is 
much 
more 
intimately 
related 
to 
the 
Latin 
races 
than 
all 
of 
Christianity 
in 
general 
is 
to 
us 
northerners—and 
unbelief 
therefore 
means 
something 
altogether 
different 
in 
Catholic 
and 
Protestant 
countries: 
among 
them, 
a 
kind 
of 
rebellion 
against 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
race, 
while 
among 
us 
it 
is 
rather 
a 
return 
to 
the 
spirit 
(or 
anti-spirit) 
of 
the 
race. 
We 
northerners 
are 
undoubtedly 
descended 
from 
barbarian 
races, 
which 
also 
shows 
in 
our 
talent 
for 
religion: 
we 
have 
little 
talent 
for 
it. 
We 
may 
except 
the 
Celts, 
who 
therefore 
also 
furnished 
the 
best 
soil 
for 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
Christian 
infection 
to 
the 
north: 
in 
France 
the 
Christian 
ideal 
came 
to 
flourish 
as 
much 
as 
the 
pale 
sun 
of 
the 
north 
permitted 
it. 
How 
strangely 
pious 
for 
our 
taste 
are 
even 
the 
most 
recent 
French 
skeptics 
insofar 
as 
they 
have 
any 
Celtic 
blood! 
How 
Catholic, 
how 
un-German 
Auguste 
Comte’s 
sociology 
smells 
to 
us 
with 
its 
Roman 
logic 
of 
the 
instincts! 
How 
Jesuitical 
that 
gracious 
and 
clever 
cicerone 
of 
Port-Royal, 
Sainte-Beuve, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
his 
hostility 
against 
the 
Jesuits! 
And 
especially 
Ernest 
Renan: 
how 
inaccessible 
the 
language 
of 
such 
a 
Renan 
sounds 
to 
us 
northerners: 
at 
one 
instant 
after 
another 
some 
nothing 
of 
religious 
tension 
unbalances 
his 
soul, 
which 
is, 
in 
the 
more 
refined 
sense, 
voluptuous 
and 
inclined 
to 
stretch 
out 
comfortably. 
Let 
us 
speak 
after 
him 
these 
beautiful 
sentences—and 
how 
much 
malice 
and 
high 
spirits 
stir 
immediately 
in 
our 
probably 
less 
beautiful 
and 
harder, 
namely 
more 
German, 
soul 
as 
a 
response! 


“Disons 
donc 
hardiment 
que 
la 
religion 
est 
un 
produit 
de 
l’homme 
normal, 
que 
l’homme 
est 
le 
plus 
dans 
le 
vrai 
quand 
il 
est 
le 
plus 
religieux 
et 
le 
plus 
assuré 
d’une 
destinée 
infinie.… 
C’est 
quand 
il 
est 
bon 
qu’il 
veut 
que 
la 
vertu 
corresponde 
à 
un 
ordre 
éternel, 
c’est 
quand 
il 
contemple 
les 
choses 
d’une 
manière 
désintéressée 
qu’il 
trouve 
la 
morte 
révoltante 
et 
absurde. 
Comment 
ne 
pas 
supposer 
que 
c’est 
dans 
ces 
moments-là, 
que 
l’homme 
voit 
le 
mieux?”8 


These 
sentences 
are 
so 
utterly 
antipodal 
to 
my 
ears 
and 
habits 
that 
on 
finding 
them 
my 
first 
wrath 
wrote 
on 
the 
margin 
“la 
niaiserie 
religieuse 
par 
excellence!” 
But 
my 
subsequent 
wrath 
actually 
took 
a 
fancy 
to 
them—these 



sentences 
standing 
truth 
on 
her 
head! 
It 
is 
so 
neat, 
so 
distinguished 
to 
have 
one’s 
own 
antipodes! 



49 


What 
is 
amazing 
about 
the 
religiosity 
of 
the 
ancient 
Greeks 
is 
the 
enormous 
abundance 
of 
gratitude 
it 
exudes: 
it 
is 
a 
very 
noble 
type 
of 
man 
that 
confronts 
nature 
and 
life 
in 
this 
way.9 


Later, 
when 
the 
rabble 
gained 
the 
upper 
hand 
in 
Greece, 
fear 
became 
rampant 
in 
religion, 
too—and 
the 
ground 
was 
prepared 
for 
Christianity.— 



50 


The 
passion 
for 
God: 
there 
are 
peasant 
types, 
sincere 
and 
obtrusive, 
like 
Luther—the 
whole 
of 
Protestantism 
lacks 
southern 
delicatezza.10 
There 
is 
sometimes 
an 
Oriental 
ecstasy 
worthy 
of 
a 
slave 
who, 
without 
deserving 
it, 
has 
been 
pardoned 
and 
elevated—for 
example, 
in 
Augustine, 
who 
lacks 
in 
a 
truly 
offensive 
manner 
all 
nobility 
of 
gestures 
and 
desires. 
There 
is 
a 
womanly 
tenderness 
and 
lust 
that 
presses 
bashfully 
and 
ignorantly 
toward 
a 
unio 
mystica 
et 
physica11—as 
in 
Madame 
de 
Guyon.12 
In 
many 
cases 
it 
appears 
oddly 
enough 
as 
a 
disguise 
for 
the 
puberty 
of 
a 
girl 
or 
youth; 
here 
and 
there 
even 
as 
the 
hysteria 
of 
an 
old 
maid, 
also 
as 
her 
final 
ambition—and 
in 
several 
such 
instances 
the 
church 
has 
proclaimed 
the 
female 
a 
saint. 



51 


So 
far 
the 
most 
powerful 
human 
beings 
have 
still 
bowed 
worshipfully 
before 
the 
saint 
as 
the 
riddle 
of 
self-conquest 
and 
deliberate 
final 
renunciation. 
Why 
did 
they 
bow? 
In 
him—and 
as 
it 
were 
behind 
the 
question 
mark 
of 
his 
fragile 
and 
miserable 
appearance—they 
sensed 
the 
superior 
force 
that 
sought 
to 
test 
itself 
in 
such 
a 
conquest, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
will 
in 
which 
they 
recognized 
and 
honored 
their 
own 
strength 
and 
delight 
in 
dominion: 
they 
honored 
something 
in 
themselves 
when 
they 
honored 
the 
saint. 
Moreover, 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
saint 
awakened 
a 
suspicion 
in 
them: 
such 
an 
enormity 
of 
denial, 
of 
anti-nature 
will 
not 
have 
been 
desired 
for 
nothing, 
they 
said 
to 
and 
asked 
themselves. 
There 
may 
be 
a 
reason 
for 
it, 
some 
very 
great 
danger 
about 
which 
the 
ascetic, 
thanks 
to 
his 
secret 
comforters 
and 
visitors, 
might 
have 
inside 
information. 
In 
short, 
the 
powerful 
of 
the 
world 
learned 
a 
new 
fear 
before 
him; 
they 
sensed 
a 
new 
power, 
a 
strange, 
as 
yet 
unconquered 
enemy— 
it 
was 
the 
“will 
to 
power” 
that 
made 
them 
stop 
before 
the 
saint. 
They 
had 
to 
ask 
him—— 



52 


In 
the 
Jewish 
“Old 
Testament,” 
the 
book 
of 
divine 
justice, 
there 
are 
human 
beings, 
things, 
and 
speeches 
in 
so 
grand 
a 
style 
that 
Greek 
and 
Indian 
literature 
have 
nothing 
to 
compare 
with 
it. 
With 
terror 
and 
reverence 
one 
stands 
before 
these 
tremendous 
remnants 
of 
what 
man 
once 
was, 
and 
will 
have 
sad 
thoughts 
about 
ancient 
Asia 
and 
its 
protruding 
little 
peninsula 
Europe, 
which 
wants 
by 
all 
means 
to 
signify 
as 
against 
Asia 
the 
“progress 
of 
man.” 
To 
be 
sure, 
whoever 
is 
himself 
merely 
a 
meager, 
tame 
domestic 
animal 
and 
knows 
only 
the 
needs 
of 
domestic 
animals 
(like 
our 
educated 
people 
of 
today, 
including 
the 
Christians 
of 
“educated” 
Christianity) 
has 
no 
cause 
for 
amazement 
or 
sorrow 
among 
these 
ruins—the 
taste 
for 
the 
Old 
Testament 
is 
a 
touchstone 
for 
“great” 
and 
“small”13—perhaps 
he 
will 
find 
the 
New 
Testament, 
the 
book 
of 
grace, 
still 
rather 
more 
after 
his 
heart 
(it 
contains 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
real, 
tender, 
musty 
true-believer 
and 
small-soul 
smell). 
To 
have 
glued 
this 
New 
Testament, 
a 
kind 
of 
rococo 
of 
taste 
in 
every 
respect, 
to 
the 
Old 
Testament 
to 
make 
one 
book, 
as 
the 
“Bible,” 
as 
“the 
book 
par 
excellence”— 
that 
is 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
audacity 
and 
“sin 
against 
the 
spirit” 
that 
literary 
Europe 
has 
on 
its 
conscience.14 



53 


Why 
atheism 
today?—”The 
father” 
in 
God 
has 
been 
thoroughly 
refuted; 
ditto, 
“the 
judge,” 
“the 
rewarder.” 
Also 
his 
“free 
will”: 
he 
does 
not 
hear—and 
if 
he 
heard 
he 
still 
would 
not 
know 
how 
to 
help. 
Worst 
of 
all: 
he 
seems 
incapable 
of 
clear 
communication: 
is 
he 
unclear? 


This 
is 
what 
I 
found 
to 
be 
causes 
for 
the 
decline 
of 
European 
theism, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
great 
many 
conversations, 
asking 
and 
listening. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
religious 
instinct 
is 
indeed 
in 
the 
process 
of 
growing 
powerfully—but 
the 
theistic 
satisfaction 
it 
refuses 
with 
deep 
suspicion. 



54 


What 
is 
the 
whole 
of 
modern 
philosophy 
doing 
at 
bottom? 
Since 
Descartes 
—actually 
more 
despite 
him 
than 
because 
of 
his 
precedent—all 
the 
philosophers 
seek 
to 
assassinate 
the 
old 
soul 
concept, 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
a 
critique 
of 
the 
subject-and-predicate 
concept—which 
means 
an 
attempt 
on 
the 
life 
of 
the 
basic 
presupposition 
of 
the 
Christian 
doctrine. 
Modern 
philosophy, 
being 
an 
epistemological 
skepticism, 
is, 
covertly 
or 
overtly, 
antiChristian—
although, 
to 
say 
this 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
more 
refined 
ears, 
by 
no 
means 
anti-religious. 


For, 
formerly, 
one 
believed 
in 
“the 
soul” 
as 
one 
believed 
in 
grammar 
and 
the 
grammatical 
subject: 
one 
said, 
“I” 
is 
the 
condition, 
“think” 
is 
the 
predicate 
and 
conditioned—thinking 
is 
an 
activity 
to 
which 
thought 
must 
supply 
a 
subject 
as 
cause. 
Then 
one 
tried 
with 
admirable 
perseverance 
and 
cunning 
to 
get 
out 
of 
this 
net—and 
asked 
whether 
the 
opposite 
might 
not 
be 
the 
case: 
“think” 
the 
condition, 
“I” 
the 
conditioned; 
“I” 
in 
that 
case 
only 
a 
synthesis 
which 
is 
made 
by 
thinking. 
At 
bottom, 
Kant 
wanted 
to 
prove 
that, 
starting 
from 
the 
subject, 
the 
subject 
could 
not 
be 
proved—nor 
could 
the 
object: 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
merely 
apparent 
existence 
of 
the 
subject, 
“the 
soul” 
in 
other 
words, 
may 
not 
always 
have 
remained 
strange 
to 
him—that 
thought 
which 
as 
Vedanta 
philosophy 
existed 
once 
before 
on 
this 
earth 
and 
exercised 
tremendous 
power. 



55 


There 
is 
a 
great 
ladder 
of 
religious 
cruelty, 
with 
many 
rungs; 
but 
three 
of 
these 
are 
the 
most 
important. 


Once 
one 
sacrificed 
human 
beings 
to 
one’s 
god, 
perhaps 
precisely 
those 
whom 
one 
loved 
most: 
the 
sacrifices 
of 
the 
first-born 
in 
all 
prehistoric 
religions 
belong 
here, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Tiberius 
in 
the 
Mithras 
grotto 
of 
the 
isle 
of 
Capri, 
that 
most 
gruesome 
of 
all 
Roman 
anachronisms. 


Then, 
during 
the 
moral 
epoch 
of 
mankind, 
one 
sacrificed 
to 
one’s 
god 
one’s 
own 
strongest 
instincts, 
one’s 
“nature”: 
this 
festive 
joy 
lights 
up 
the 
cruel 
eyes 
of 
the 
ascetic, 
the 
“anti-natural” 
enthusiast. 


Finally—what 
remained 
to 
be 
sacrificed? 
At 
long 
last, 
did 
one 
not 
have 
to 
sacrifice 
for 
once 
whatever 
is 
comforting, 
holy, 
healing; 
all 
hope, 
all 
faith 
in 
hidden 
harmony, 
in 
future 
blisses 
and 
justices? 
didn’t 
one 
have 
to 
sacrifice 
God 
himself 
and, 
from 
cruelty 
against 
oneself, 
worship 
the 
stone, 
stupidity, 
gravity, 
fate, 
the 
nothing? 
To 
sacrifice 
God 
for 
the 
nothing—this 
paradoxical 
mystery 
of 
the 
final 
cruelty 
was 
reserved 
for 
the 
generation 
that 
is 
now 
coming 
up: 
all 
of 
us 
already 
know 
something 
of 
this.— 



56 


Whoever 
has 
endeavored 
with 
some 
enigmatic 
longing, 
as 
I 
have, 
to 
think 
pessimism 
through 
to 
its 
depths 
and 
to 
liberate 
it 
from 
the 
half-Christian, 
half-German 
narrowness 
and 
simplicity 
in 
which 
it 
has 
finally 
presented 
itself 
to 
our 
century, 
namely, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
Schopenhauer’s 
philosophy; 
whoever 
has 
really, 
with 
an 
Asiatic 
and 
supra-Asiatic 
eye, 
looked 
into, 
down 
into 
the 
most 
world-denying 
of 
all 
possible 
ways 
of 
thinking—beyond 
good 
and 
evil 
and 
no 
longer, 
like 
the 
Buddha 
and 
Schopenhauer, 
under 
the 
spell 
and 
delusion 
of 
morality—may 
just 
thereby, 
without 
really 
meaning 
to 
do 
so, 
have 
opened 
his 
eyes 
to 
the 
opposite 
ideal: 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
most 
high-spirited, 
alive, 
and 
world-affirming 
human 
being 
who 
has 
not 
only 
come 
to 
terms 
and 
learned 
to 
get 
along 
with 
whatever 
was 
and 
is, 
but 
who 
wants 
to 
have 
what 
was 
and 
is 
repeated 
into 
all 
eternity,15 
shouting 
insatiably 
da 
capo16—not 
only 
to 
himself 
but 
to 
the 
whole 
play 
and 
spectacle, 
and 
not 
only 
to 
a 
spectacle 
but 
at 
bottom 
to 
him 
who 
needs 
precisely 
this 
spectacle—and 
who 
makes 
it 
necessary 
because 
again 
and 
again 
he 
needs 
himself—and 
makes 
himself 
necessary—— 
What? 
And 
this 
wouldn’t 
be—circulus 
vitiosus 
deus? 


17 



57 


With 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
spiritual 
eye 
and 
insight 
grows 
distance 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
space 
around 
man: 
his 
world 
becomes 
more 
profound; 
ever 
new 
stars, 
ever 
new 
riddles 
and 
images 
become 
visible 
for 
him. 
Perhaps 
everything 
on 
which 
the 
spirit’s 
eye 
has 
exercised 
its 
acuteness 
and 
thoughtfulness 
was 
nothing 
but 
an 
occasion 
for 
this 
exercise, 
a 
playful 
matter, 
something 
for 
children 
and 
those 
who 
are 
childish. 
Perhaps 
the 
day 
will 
come 
when 
the 
most 
solemn 
concepts 
which 
have 
caused 
the 
most 
fights 
and 
suffering, 
the 
concepts 
“God” 
and 
“sin,” 
will 
seem 
no 
more 
important 
to 
us 
than 
a 
child’s 
toy 
and 
a 
child’s 
pain 
seem 
to 
an 
old 
man—and 
perhaps 
“the 
old 
man” 
will 
then 
be 
in 
need 
of 
another 
toy 
and 
another 
pain—still 
child 
enough, 
an 
eternal 
child! 



58 


Has 
it 
ever 
been 
really 
noted 
to 
what 
extent 
a 
genuinely 
religious 
life 
(both 
its 
microscopic 
favorite 
occupation 
of 
self-examination 
and 
that 
tender 
composure 
which 
calls 
itself 
“prayer” 
and 
is 
a 
continual 
readiness 
for 
the 
“coming 
of 
God”) 
requires 
a 
leisure 
class, 
or 
half-leisure—I 
mean 
leisure 
with 
a 
good 
conscience, 
from 
way 
back, 
by 
blood, 
to 
which 
the 
aristocratic 
feeling 
that 
work 
disgraces 
is 
not 
altogether 
alien—the 
feeling 
that 
it 
makes 
soul 
and 
body 
common. 
And 
that 
consequently 
our 
modern, 
noisy, 
time-
consuming 
industriousness, 
proud 
of 
itself, 
stupidly 
proud, 
educates 
and 
prepares 
people, 
more 
than 
anything 
else 
does, 
precisely 
for 
“unbelief.” 


Among 
those, 
for 
example, 
who 
now 
live 
in 
Germany 
at 
a 
distance 
from 
religion 
I 
find 
people 
whose 
“free-thinking” 
is 
of 
diverse 
types 
and 
origins, 
but 
above 
all 
a 
majority 
of 
those 
in 
whom 
industriousness 
has, 
from 
generation 
unto 
generation, 
dissolved 
the 
religious 
instincts, 
so 
they 
no 
longer 
even 
know 
what 
religions 
are 
good 
for 
and 
merely 
register 
their 
presence 
in 
the 
world 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
dumb 
amazement. 
They 
feel 
abundantly 
committed, 
these 
good 
people, 
whether 
to 
their 
business 
or 
to 
their 
pleasures, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
“fatherland” 
and 
the 
newspapers 
and 
“family 
obligations”: 
it 
seems 
that 
they 
simply 
have 
no 
time 
left 
for 
religion, 
the 
more 
so 
because 
it 
remains 
unclear 
to 
them 
whether 
it 
involves 
another 
business 
or 
another 
pleasure—for 
it 
is 
not 
possible, 
they 
say 
to 
themselves, 
that 
one 
goes 
to 
church 
merely 
to 
dampen 
one’s 
good 
spirits. 
They 
are 
not 
enemies 
of 
religious 
customs; 
when 
participation 
in 
such 
customs 
is 
required 
in 
certain 
cases, 
by 
the 
state, 
for 
example, 
they 
do 
what 
is 
required, 
as 
one 
does 
so 
many 
things—with 
a 
patient 
and 
modest 
seriousness 
and 
without 
much 
curiosity 
and 
discomfort: 
they 
simply 
live 
too 
much 
apart 
and 
outside 
to 
feel 
any 
need 
for 
any 
pro 
and 
con 
in 
such 
matters. 


Those 
indifferent 
in 
this 
way 
include 
today 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
German 
middle-class 
Protestants, 
especially 
in 
the 
great 
industrious 
centers 
of 
trade 
and 
traffic; 
also 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
industrious 
scholars 
and 
the 
other 
accessories 
of 
the 
universities 
(excepting 
the 
theologians, 
whose 
presence 
and 
possibility 
there 
pose 
ever 
increasing 
and 
ever 
subtler 
riddles 
for 
a 
psychologist). 
Pious 
or 
even 
merely 
churchly 
people 
rarely 
have 
the 
slightest 



idea 
how 
much, 
good 
will—one 
might 
say 
caprice—is 
required 
of 
a 
German 
scholar 
today 
if 
he 
is 
to 
take 
the 
problem 
of 
religion 
seriously. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
his 
whole 
trade 
(and, 
as 
noted, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
tradelike 
industriousness 
to 
which 
he 
is 
committed 
by 
his 
modern 
conscience) 
he 
is 
inclined 
toward 
a 
superior, 
almost 
good-natured 
amusement 
in 
the 
face 
of 
religion, 
occasionally 
mixed 
with 
a 
dash 
of 
disdain 
for 
the 
“uncleanliness” 
of 
the 
spirit 
which 
he 
assumes 
wherever 
a 
church 
is 
still 
acknowledged. 
The 
scholar 
succeeds 
only 
with 
the 
help 
of 
history 
(not 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
his 
own 
personal 
experience) 
to 
muster 
a 
reverent 
seriousness 
and 
a 
certain 
shy 
consideration 
in 
the 
face 
of 
religion. 
But 
even 
if 
he 
raises 
his 
feeling 
into 
real 
gratitude 
toward 
it,18 
he 
still 
has 
not 
personally 
approached, 
not 
even 
by 
a 
single 
step, 
what 
still 
exists 
now 
as 
church 
or 
piety; 
perhaps 
even 
the 
opposite. 
The 
practical 
indifference 
toward 
religious 
matters 
into 
which 
he 
has 
been 
born 
and 
brought 
up 
is 
generally 
sublimated 
in 
him 
into 
caution 
and 
cleanliness 
that 
shun 
contact 
with 
religious 
men 
and 
matters; 
and 
it 
may 
be 
precisely 
the 
depth 
of 
his 
tolerance 
and 
humanity 
that 
bids 
him 
dodge 
the 
subtle 
distress 
involved 
in 
tolerance. 


Every 
age 
has 
its 
own 
divine 
type 
of 
naïveté 
for 
whose 
invention 
other 
ages 
may 
envy 
it—and 
how 
much 
naïveté, 
venerable, 
childlike, 
and 
boundlessly 
clumsy 
naïveté 
lies 
in 
the 
scholar’s 
faith 
in 
his 
superiority, 
in 
the 
good 
conscience 
of 
his 
tolerance, 
in 
the 
unsuspecting 
simple 
certainty 
with 
which 
his 
instinct 
treats 
the 
religious 
man 
as 
an 
inferior 
and 
lower 
type 
that 
he 
has 
outgrown, 
leaving 
it 
behind, 
beneath 
him—him, 
that 
presumptuous 
little 
dwarf 
and 
rabble 
man, 
the 
assiduous 
and 
speedy 
head-and 
handiworker 
of 
“ideas,” 
of 
“modern 
ideas”! 



59 


Anyone 
who 
has 
looked 
deeply 
into 
the 
world 
may 
guess 
how 
much 
wisdom 
lies 
in 
the 
superficiality 
of 
men. 
The 
instinct 
that 
preserves 
them 
teaches 
them 
to 
be 
flighty, 
light, 
and 
false. 
Here 
and 
there 
one 
encounters 
an 
impassioned 
and 
exaggerated 
worship 
of 
“pure 
forms,” 
among 
both 
philosophers 
and 
artists: 
let 
nobody 
doubt 
that 
whoever 
stands 
that 
much 
in 
need 
of 
the 
cult 
of 
surfaces 
must 
at 
some 
time 
have 
reached 
beneath 
them 
with 
disastrous 
results. 


Perhaps 
there 
even 
exists 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
among 
these 
burnt 
children, 
these 
born, 
artists 
who 
can 
find 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
life 
only 
in 
the 
intention 
of 
falsifying 
its 
image 
(as 
it 
were, 
in 
a 
longwinded 
revenge 
on 
life): 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
life 
has 
been 
spoiled 
for 
them 
might 
be 
inferred 
from 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
they 
wish 
to 
see 
its 
image 
falsified, 
thinned 
down, 
transcendentalized, 
deified—the 
homines 
religiosi 
might 
be 
included 
among 
artists, 
as 
their 
highest 
rank. 


It 
is 
the 
profound, 
suspicious 
fear 
of 
an 
incurable 
pessimism 
that 
forces 
whole 
millennia 
to 
bury 
their 
teeth 
in 
and 
cling 
to 
a 
religious 
interpretation 
of 
existence: 
the 
fear 
of 
that 
instinct 
which 
senses 
that 
one 
might 
get 
a 
hold 
of 
the 
truth 
too 
soon, 
before 
man 
has 
become 
strong 
enough, 
hard 
enough, 
artist 
enough. 


Piety, 
the 
“life 
in 
God,” 
seen 
in 
this 
way, 
would 
appear 
as 
the 
subtlest 
and 
final 
offspring 
of 
the 
fear 
of 
truth, 
as 
an 
artist’s 
worship 
and 
intoxication 
before 
the 
most 
consistent 
of 
all 
falsifications, 
as 
the 
will 
to 
the 
inversion 
of 
truth, 
to 
untruth 
at 
any 
price. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
until 
now 
there 
has 
been 
no 
more 
potent 
means 
for 
beautifying 
man 
himself 
than 
piety: 
it 
can 
turn 
man 
into 
so 
much 
art, 
surface, 
play 
of 
colors, 
graciousness 
that 
his 
sight 
no 
longer 
makes 
one 
suffer.— 



60 


To 
love 
man 
for 
God’s 
sake—that 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
noblest 
and 
most 
remote 
feeling 
attained 
among 
men. 
That 
the 
love 
of 
man 
is 
just 
one 
more 
stupidity 
and 
brutishness 
if 
there 
is 
no 
ulterior 
intent 
to 
sanctify 
it; 
that 
the 
inclination 
to 
such 
love 
of 
man 
must 
receive 
its 
measure, 
its 
subtlety, 
its 
grain 
of 
salt 
and 
dash 
of 
ambergris 
from 
some 
higher 
inclination—whoever 
the 
human 
being 
may 
have 
been 
who 
first 
felt 
and 
“experienced” 
this, 
however 
much 
his 
tongue 
may 
have 
stumbled19 
as 
it 
tried 
to 
express 
such 
délicatesse, 
let 
him 
remain 
holy 
and 
venerable 
for 
us 
for 
all 
time 
as 
the 
human 
being 
who 
has 
flown 
highest 
yet 
and 
gone 
astray 
most 
beautifully!

The 
philosopher 
as 
we 
understand 
him, 
we 
free 
spirits—as 
the 
man 
of 
the 
most 
comprehensive 
responsibility 
who 
has 
the 
conscience 
for 
the 
over-all 
development 
of 
man—this 
philosopher 
will 
make 
use 
of 
religions 
for 
his 
project 
of 
cultivation20 
and 
education, 
just 
as 
he 
will 
make 
use 
of 
whatever 
political 
and 
economic 
states 
are 
at 
hand. 
The 
selective 
and 
cultivating21 
influence, 
always 
destructive 
as 
well 
as 
creative 
and 
form-giving, 
which 
can 
be 
exerted 
with 
the 
help 
of 
religions, 
is 
always 
multiple 
and 
different 
according 
to 
the 
sort 
of 
human 
beings 
who 
are 
placed 
under 
its 
spell 
and 
protection. 
For 
the 
strong 
and 
independent 
who 
are 
prepared 
and 
predestined 
to 
command 
and 
in 
whom 
the 
reason 
and 
art 
of 
a 
governing 
race 
become 
incarnate, 
religion 
is 
one 
more 
means 
for 
overcoming 
resistances, 
for 
the 
ability 
to 
rule—as 
a 
bond 
that 
unites 
rulers 
and 
subjects 
and 
betrays 
and 
delivers 
the 
consciences 
of 
the 
latter, 
that 
which 
is 
most 
concealed 
and 
intimate 
and 
would 
like 
to 
elude 
obedience, 
to 
the 
former. 
And 
if 
a 
few 
individuals 
of 
such 
noble 
descent 
are 
inclined 
through 
lofty 
spirituality 
to 
prefer 
a 
more 
withdrawn 
and 
contemplative 
life 
and 
reserve 
for 
themselves 
only 
the 
most 
subtle 
type 
of 
rule 
(over 
selected 
disciples 
or 
brothers 
in 
some 
order), 
then 
religion 
can 
even 
be 
used 
as 
a 
means 
for 
obtaining 
peace 
from 
the 
noise 
and 
exertion 
of 
cruder 
forms 
of 
government, 
and 
purity 
from 
the 
necessary 
dirt 
of 
all 
politics. 
That 
is 
how 
the 
Brahmins, 
for 
example, 
understood 
things: 
by 
means 
of 
a 
religious 
organization 
they 
gave 
themselves 
the 
power 
of 
nominating 
the 
kings 
of 
the 
people 
while 
they 
themselves 
kept 
and 
felt 
apart 
and 
outside, 
as 
men 
of 
higher 
and 
supra-royal 
tasks. 


Meanwhile 
religion 
also 
gives 
to 
some 
of 
the 
ruled 
the 
instruction 
and 
opportunity 
to 
prepare 
themselves 
for 
future 
ruling 
and 
obeying: 
those 
slowly 
ascending 
classes—in 
which, 
thanks 
to 
fortunate 
marital 
customs, 
the 
strength 
and 
joy 
of 
the 
will, 
the 
will 
to 
self-control 
is 
ever 
growing—receive 
enough 
nudges 
and 
temptations 
from 
religion 
to 
walk 
the 
paths 
to 
higher 
spirituality, 
to 
test 
the 
feelings 
of 
great 
self-overcoming, 
of 
silence 
and 
solitude. 
Asceticism 
and 
puritanism 
are 
almost 
indispensable 
means 
for 
educating 
and 
ennobling 
a 
race 
that 
wishes 
to 
become 
master 
over 
its 
origins 



among 
the 
rabble 
and 
that 
works 
its 
way 
up 
toward 
future 
rule. 


To 
ordinary 
human 
beings, 
finally—the 
vast 
majority 
who 
exist 
for 
service 
and 
the 
general 
advantage, 
and 
who 
may 
exist 
only 
for 
that—religion 
gives 
an 
inestimable 
contentment 
with 
their 
situation 
and 
type, 
manifold 
peace 
of 
the 
heart, 
an 
ennobling 
of 
obedience, 
one 
further 
happiness 
and 
sorrow 
with 
their 
peers 
and 
something 
transfiguring 
and 
beautifying, 
something 
of 
a 
justification 
for 
the 
whole 
everyday 
character, 
the 
whole 
lowliness, 
the 
whole 
half-brutish 
poverty 
of 
their 
souls. 
Religion 
and 
religious 
significance 
spread 
the 
splendor 
of 
the 
sun 
over 
such 
ever-toiling 
human 
beings 
and 
make 
their 
own 
sight 
tolerable 
to 
them. 
Religion 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
which 
an 
Epicurean 
philosophy 
has 
on 
sufferers 
of 
a 
higher 
rank: 
it 
is 
refreshing, 
refining, 
makes, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
most 
of 
suffering, 
and 
in 
the 
end 
even 
sanctifies 
and 
justifies. 
Perhaps 
nothing 
in 
Christianity 
or 
Buddhism 
is 
as 
venerable 
as 
their 
art 
of 
teaching 
even 
the 
lowliest 
how 
to 
place 
themselves 
through 
piety 
in 
an 
illusory 
higher 
order 
of 
things 
and 
thus 
to 
maintain 
their 
contentment 
with 
the 
real 
order, 
in 
which 
their 
life 
is 
hard 
enough—and 
precisely 
this 
hardness 
is 
necessary. 



62 


In 
the 
end, 
to 
be 
sure—to 
present 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
account 
of 
these 
religions, 
too, 
and 
to 
expose 
their 
uncanny 
dangerousness—one 
always 
pays 
dearly 
and 
terribly 
when 
religions 
do 
not 
want 
to 
be 
a 
means 
of 
education 
and 
cultivation 
in 
the 
philosopher’s 
hand 
but 
insist 
on 
having 
their 
own 
sovereign 
way, 
when 
they 
themselves 
want 
to 
be 
ultimate 
ends 
and 
not 
means 
among 
other 
means. 
There 
is 
among 
men 
as 
in 
every 
other 
animal 
species 
an 
excess 
of 
failures, 
of 
the 
sick, 
degenerating, 
infirm, 
who 
suffer 
necessarily; 
the 
successful 
cases 
are, 
among 
men 
too, 
always 
the 
exception—and 
in 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
man 
is 
the 
as 
yet 
undetermined 
animal, 
the 
rare 
exception. 
But 
still 
worse: 
the 
higher 
the 
type 
of 
man 
that 
a 
man 
represents, 
the 
greater 
the 
improbability 
that 
he 
will 
turn 
out 
well. 
The 
accidental, 
the 
law 
of 
absurdity 
in 
the 
whole 
economy 
of 
mankind, 
manifests 
itself 
most 
horribly 
in 
its 
destructive 
effect 
on 
the 
higher 
men 
whose 
complicated 
conditions 
of 
life 
can 
only 
be 
calculated 
with 
great 
subtlety 
and 
difficulty. 


What, 
then, 
is 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
two 
greatest 
religions 
toward 
this 
excess 
of 
cases 
that 
did 
not 
turn 
out 
right? 
They 
seek 
to 
preserve, 
to 
preserve 
alive 
whatever 
can 
possibly 
be 
preserved; 
indeed, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle, 
they 
side 
with 
these 
cases 
as 
religions 
for 
sufferers; 
they 
agree 
with 
all 
those 
who 
suffer 
life 
like 
a 
sickness 
and 
would 
like 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
every 
other 
feeling 
about 
life 
should 
be 
considered 
false 
and 
should 
become 
impossible. 
Even 
if 
the 
very 
highest 
credit 
is 
given 
to 
this 
considerate 
and 
preserving 
care, 
which, 
besides 
being 
directed 
toward 
all 
the 
others, 
was 
and 
is 
also 
directed 
toward 
the 
highest 
type 
of 
man, 
the 
type 
that 
so 
far 
has 
almost 
always 
suffered 
most; 
nevertheless, 
in 
a 
total 
accounting, 
the 
sovereign 
religions 
we 
have 
had 
so 
far 
are 
among 
the 
chief 
causes 
that 
have 
kept 
the 
type 
“man” 
on 
a 
lower 
rung—they 
have 
preserved 
too 
much 
of 
what 
ought 
to 
perish. 
What 
we 
have 
to 
thank 
them 
for 
is 
inestimable; 
and 
who 
could 
be 
rich 
enough 
in 
gratitude 
not 
to 
be 
impoverished 
in 
view 
of 
all 
that 
the 
“spiritual 
men” 
of 
Christianity, 
for 
example, 
have 
so 
far 
done 
for 
Europe! 
And 
yet, 
when 
they 
gave 
comfort 
to 
sufferers, 
courage 
to 
the 
oppressed 
and 
despairing, 
a 
staff 
and 
support 
to 
the 
dependent, 
and 
lured 
away 
from 
society 
into 
monasteries 
and 
penitentiaries 
for 
the 
soul 
those 
who 
had 
been 
destroyed 



inwardly 
and 
who 
had 
become 
savage: 
how 
much 
more 
did 
they 
have 
to 
do 
besides, 
in 
order 
to 
work 
with 
a 
good 
conscience 
and 
on 
principle, 
to 
preserve 
all 
that 
was 
sick 
and 
that 
suffered—which 
means, 
in 
fact 
and 
in 
truth, 
to 
worsen 
the 
European 
race? 
Stand 
all 
valuations 
on 
their 
head—that 
is 
what 
they 
had 
to 
do. 
And 
break 
the 
strong, 
sickly 
o’er22 
great 
hopes, 
cast 
suspicion 
on 
the 
joy 
in 
beauty, 
bend 
everything 
haughty, 
manly, 
conquering, 
domineering, 
all 
the 
instincts 
characteristic 
of 
the 
highest 
and 
best-turned-out 
type 
of 
“man,” 
into 
unsureness, 
agony 
of 
conscience, 
self-destruction— 
indeed, 
invert 
all 
love 
of 
the 
earthly 
and 
of 
dominion 
over 
the 
earth 
into 
hatred 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
the 
earthly—that 
is 
the 
task 
the 
church 
posed 
for 
itself 
and 
had 
to 
pose, 
until 
in 
its 
estimation 
“becoming 
unworldly,” 
“unsensual,” 
and 
“higher 
men” 
were 
fused 
into 
a 
single 
feeling. 


Suppose 
we 
could 
contemplate 
the 
oddly 
painful 
and 
equally 
crude 
and 
subtle 
comedy 
of 
European 
Christianity 
with 
the 
mocking 
and 
aloof 
eyes 
of 
an 
Epicurean 
god, 
I 
think 
our 
amazement 
and 
laughter 
would 
never 
end: 
doesn’t 
it 
seem 
that 
a 
single 
will 
dominated 
Europe 
for 
eighteen 
centuries— 
to 
turn 
man 
into 
a 
sublime 
miscarriage? 
Anyone, 
however, 
who 
approached 
this 
almost 
deliberate 
degeneration 
and 
atrophy 
of 
man 
represented 
by 
the 
Christian 
European 
(Pascal, 
for 
example), 
feeling 
the 
opposite 
kind 
of 
desire, 
not 
in 
an 
Epicurean 
spirit 
but 
rather 
with 
some 
divine 
hammer 
in 
his 
hand, 
would 
surely 
have 
to 
cry 
out 
in 
wrath, 
in 
pity, 
in 
horror: 
“O 
you 
dolts, 
you 
presumptuous, 
pitying 
dolts, 
what 
have 
you 
done! 
Was 
that 
work 
for 
your 
hands? 
How 
have 
you 
bungled 
and 
botched 
my 
beautiful 
stone! 
What 
presumption!” 


I 
meant 
to 
say: 
Christianity 
has 
been 
the 
most 
calamitous 
kind 
of 
arrogance 
yet. 
Men, 
not 
high 
and 
hard 
enough 
to 
have 
any 
right 
to 
try 
to 
form 
man 
as 
artists; 
men, 
not 
strong 
and 
farsighted 
enough 
to 
let 
the 
foreground 
law 
of 
thousandfold 
failure 
and 
ruin 
prevail, 
though 
it 
cost 
them 
sublime 
self-
conquest; 
men, 
not 
noble 
enough 
to 
see 
the 
abysmally 
different 
order 
of 
rank, 
chasm 
of 
rank, 
between 
man 
and 
man—such 
men 
have 
so 
far 
held 
sway 
over 
the 
fate 
of 
Europe, 
with 
their 
“equal 
before 
God,” 
until 
finally 
a 
smaller, 
almost 
ridiculous 
type, 
a 
herd 
animal, 
something 
eager 
to 
please, 
sickly, 
and 
mediocre 
has 
been 
bred, 
the 
European 
of 
today—

The 
German 
title 
is 
Das 
religiöse 
Wesen. 
The 
word 
Wesen 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
translate. 
In 
philosophical 
prose 
it 
is 
most 
often 
rendered 
by 



“essence,” 
but 
in 
many 
contexts 
“being” 
is 
called 
for; 
e.g., 
a 
natural 
being, 
a 
human 
being. 
Above, 
either 
“the 
religious 
nature” 
or 
“the 
religious 
being” 
might 
do. 
But 
in 
section 
47 
Nietzsche 
speaks 
of 
“the 
religious 
neurosis—or 
what 
I 
call 
‘das 
religiöse 
Wesen’ 
”; 
and 
this 
puts 
one 
in 
mind 
of 
contexts 
in 
which 
Wesen 
means 
character, 
conduct, 
manners, 
airs, 
and 
even 
ado: 
viel 
Wesen 
means 
much 
ado. 
Finanzwesen 
means 
financial 
affairs, 
or 
the 
financial 
establishment, 
or 
finances. 
Bankwesen, 
banks 
or 
banking 
in 
general; 
Minenwesen, 
mining; 
and 
Kriegswesen, 
military 
art—these 
last 
examples 
come 
from 
a 
dictionary.

“So 
let 
us 
make 
bold 
to 
say 
that 
religion 
is 
a 
product 
of 
the 
normal 
man, 
that 
man 
is 
closest 
to 
the 
truth 
when 
he 
is 
most 
religious 
and 
most 
certain 
of 
an 
infinite 
destiny.… 
It 
is 
when 
he 
is 
good 
that 
he 
wants 
virtue 
to 
correspond 
to 
an 
eternal 
order; 
it 
is 
when 
he 
contemplates 
things 
in 
a 
disinterested 
manner 
that 
he 
finds 
death 
revolting 
and 
absurd. 
How 
can 
we 
but 
suppose 
that 
it 
is 
in 
moments 
like 
this 
that 
man 
sees 
best?” 


9 
In 
other 
words, 
that 
affirms 
life 
as 
a 
great 
boon, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
its 
terrors: 
this 
shows 
great 
strength 
and 
a 
remarkable 
and 
noble 
freedom 
from 
resentment.

Madame 
Guyon 
(Jeanne-Marie 
Bouvier 
de 
la 
Motte-Guyon, 
1648-1717), 
was 
a 
French 
mystic 
who 
is 
considered 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
advocates 
of 
Quietism, 
introduced 
before 
1675 
by 
Miguel 
Molinos 
(1640-96), 
a 
Spanish 
priest 
who 
was 
arrested 
by 
the 
Roman 
Inquisition 
in 
1685 
and 
sentenced 
to 
perpetual 
imprisonment 
in 
1687. 
Madame 
Guyon 
was 
imprisoned 
from 
1695 
to 
1703. 
The 
Quietist 
doctrine 
was 
condemned 
by 
Innocent 
XII 
in 
1699.

A

the

is 
a 
vicious

In

Whoever 
is 
a 
teacher 
through 
and 
through 
takes 
all 
things 
seriously 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
his 
students—even 
himself. 



64 


“Knowledge 
for 
its 
own 
sake”—that 
is 
the 
last 
snare 
of 
morality: 
with 
that 
one 
becomes 
completely 
entangled 
in 
it 
once 
more. 



65 


The 
attraction 
of 
knowledge 
would 
be 
small 
if 
one 
did 
not 
have 
to 
overcome 
so 
much 
shame 
on 
the 
way. 



65a1 


One 
is 
most 
dishonest 
to 
one’s 
god: 
he 
is 
not 
allowed 
to 
sin. 



66 


The 
inclination 
to 
depreciate 
himself, 
to 
let 
himself 
be 
robbed, 
lied 
to, 
and 
taken 
advantage 
of, 
could 
be 
the 
modesty2 
of 
a 
god 
among 
men. 



67 


Love 
of 
one 
is 
a 
barbarism; 
for 
it 
is 
exercised 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
all 
others. 
The 
love 
of 
God, 
too. 



68 


“I 
have 
done 
that,” 
says 
my 
memory. 
“I 
cannot 
have 
done 
that,” 
says 
my 
pride, 
and 
remains 
inexorable. 
Eventually—memory 
yields.3 



69 


One 
has 
watched 
life 
badly 
if 
one 
has 
not 
also 
seen 
the 
hand 
that 
considerately—kills. 



70 


If 
one 
has 
character 
one 
also 
has 
one’s 
typical 
experience, 
which 
recurs 
repeatedly. 



71 


The 
sage 
as 
astronomer.— 
As 
long 
as 
you 
still 
experience 
the 
stars 
as 
something 
“above 
you” 
you 
lack 
the 
eye 
of 
knowledge. 



72 


Not 
the 
intensity 
but 
the 
duration 
of 
high 
feelings 
makes 
high 
men. 



73 


Whoever 
reaches 
his 
ideal 
transcends 
it 
eo 
ipso. 



73a4 


Many 
a 
peacock 
hides 
his 
peacock 
tail 
from 
all 
eyes—and 
calls 
that 
his 
pride. 



74 


A 
man 
with 
spirit 
is 
unbearable 
if 
he 
does 
not 
also 
have 
at 
least 
two 
other 
things: 
gratitude5 
and 
cleanliness. 



75 


The 
degree 
and 
kind 
of 
a 
man’s 
sexuality 
reach 
up 
into 
the 
ultimate 
pinnacle 
of 
his 
spirit. 



76 


Under 
peaceful 
conditions 
a 
warlike 
man 
sets 
upon 
himself. 



77 


With 
one’s 
principles 
one 
wants 
to 
bully 
one’s 
habits, 
or 
justify, 
honor, 
scold, 
or 
conceal 
them: 
two 
men 
with 
the 
same 
principles 
probably 
aim 
with 
them 
at 
something 
basically 
different. 



78 


Whoever 
despises 
himself 
still 
respects 
himself 
as 
one 
who 
despises. 



79 


A 
soul 
that 
knows 
it 
is 
loved 
but 
does 
not 
itself 
love 
betrays 
its 
sediment: 
what 
is 
at 
the 
bottom 
comes 
up. 



80 


A 
matter 
that 
becomes 
clear 
ceases 
to 
concern 
us.— 
What 
was 
on 
the 
mind 
of 
that 
god 
who 
counseled: 
“Know 
thyself!” 
Did 
he 
mean: 
“Cease 
to 
concern 
yourself! 
Become 
objective!”— 
And 
Socrates?— 
And 
“scientific 
men”?— 



81 


It 
is 
terrible 
to 
die 
of 
thirst 
in 
the 
ocean. 
Do 
you 
have 
to 
salt 
your 
truth 
so 
heavily 
that 
it 
does 
not 
even—quench 
thirst 
any 
more? 



82 


“Pity 
for 
all”—would 
be 
hardness 
and 
tyranny 
toward 
you, 
my 
dear 
neighbor!— 



83 


Instinct.— 
When 
the 
house 
burns 
one 
forgets 
even 
lunch.— 
Yes, 
but 
one 
eats 
it 
later 
in 
the 
ashes. 



84 


Woman 
learns 
to 
hate 
to 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
her 
charms—decrease. 



85 


The 
same 
affects 
in 
man 
and 
woman 
are 
yet 
different 
in 
tempo: 
therefore 
man 
and 
woman 
do 
not 
cease 
to 
misunderstand 
each 
other. 



86 


Women 
themselves 
always 
still 
have 
in 
the 
background 
of 
all 
personal 
vanity 
an 
impersonal 
contempt—for 
“woman.”— 



87 


Tethered 
heart, 
free 
spirit.— 
If 
one 
tethers 
one’s 
heart 
severely 
and 
imprisons 
it, 
one 
can 
give 
one’s 
spirit 
many 
liberties: 
I 
have 
said 
that 
once 
before. 
But 
one 
does 
not 
believe 
me, 
unless 
one 
already 
knows 
it— 



88 


One 
begins 
to 
mistrust 
very 
clever 
people 
when 
they 
become 
embarrassed. 



89 


Terrible 
experiences 
pose 
the 
riddle 
whether 
the 
person 
who 
has 
them 
is 
not 
terrible. 



90 


Heavy, 
heavy-spirited 
people 
become 
lighter 
precisely 
through 
what 
makes 
others 
heavier, 
through 
hatred 
and 
love, 
and 
for 
a 
time 
they 
surface. 



91 


So 
cold, 
so 
icy 
that 
one 
burns 
one’s 
fingers 
on 
him! 
Every 
hand 
is 
startled 
when 
touching 
him.— 
And 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
some 
think 
he 
glows. 



92 


Who 
has 
not, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
his 
good 
reputation—sacrificed 
himself 
once? 


— 



93 


Affability 
contains 
no 
hatred 
of 
men, 
but 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
too 
much 
contempt 
for 
men. 



94 


A 
man’s 
maturity—consists 
in 
having 
found 
again 
the 
seriousness 
one 
had 
as 
a 
child, 
at 
play. 



95 


To 
be 
ashamed 
of 
one’s 
immorality—that 
is 
a 
step 
on 
the 
staircase 
at 
whose 
end 
one 
is 
also 
ashamed 
of 
one’s 
morality. 



96 


One 
should 
part 
from 
life 
as 
Odysseus 
parted 
from 
Nausicaa—blessing 
it 
rather 
than 
in 
love 
with 
it. 



97 


What? 
A 
great 
man? 
I 
always 
see 
only 
the 
actor 
of 
his 
own 
ideal. 



98 


If 
we 
train 
our 
conscience, 
it 
kisses 
us 
while 
it 
hurts 
us. 



99 


The 
voice 
of 
disappointment:6 
“I 
listened 
for 
an 
echo 
and 
heard 
nothing 
but 
praise—” 



100 


In 
front 
of 
ourselves 
we 
all 
pose 
as 
simpler 
than 
we 
are: 
thus 
we 
take 
a 
rest 
from 
our 
fellow 
men. 



101 


Today 
the 
man 
of 
knowledge 
might 
well 
feel 
like 
God 
become 
animal. 



102 


Discovering 
that 
one 
is 
loved 
in 
return 
really 
ought 
to 
disenchant 
the 
lover 
with 
the 
beloved. 
“What? 
this 
person 
is 
modest 
enough 
to 
love 
even 
you? 
Or 
stupid 
enough? 
Or—or—” 



103 


Danger 
in 
happiness.7— 
“Now 
everything 
redounds 
to 
my 
best, 
now 
I 
love 
every 
destiny—who 
feels 
like 
being 
my 
destiny?” 



104 


Not 
their 
love 
of 
men 
but 
the 
impotence 
of 
their 
love 
of 
men 
keeps 
the 
Christians 
of 
today 
from—burning 
us.8 



105 


The 
pia 
fraus9 
offends 
the 
taste 
(the 
“piety”) 
of 
the 
free 
spirit, 
who 
has 
“the 
piety 
of 
the 
search 
for 
knowledge,” 
even 
more 
than 
the 
impia 
fraus. 
Hence 
his 
profound 
lack 
of 
understanding 
for 
the 
church, 
a 
characteristic 
of 
the 
type 
“free 
spirit”—his 
unfreedom. 



106 


In 
music 
the 
passions 
enjoy 
themselves. 



107 


Once 
the 
decision 
has 
been 
made, 
close 
your 
ear 
even 
to 
the 
best 
counterargument: 
sign 
of 
a 
strong 
character. 
Thus 
an 
occasional 
will 
to 
stupidity. 



108 


There 
are 
no 
moral 
phenomena 
at 
all, 
but 
only 
a 
moral 
interpretation 
of 
phenomena— 



109 


A 
criminal 
is 
frequently 
not 
equal 
to 
his 
deed: 
he 
makes 
it 
smaller 
and 
slanders 
it.10 



110 


The 
lawyers 
defending 
a 
criminal 
are 
rarely 
artists 
enough 
to 
turn 
the 
beautiful 
terribleness 
of 
his 
deed 
to 
his 
advantage. 



111 


Our 
vanity 
is 
hardest 
to 
wound 
when 
our 
pride 
has 
just 
been 
wounded. 



112 


Those 
who 
feel 
predestined 
to 
see 
and 
not 
to 
believe 
will 
find 
all 
believers 
too 
noisy 
and 
obtrusive: 
they 
fend 
them 
off. 



113 


“You 
want 
to 
prepossess 
him 
in 
your 
favor? 
Then 
pretend 
to 
be 
embarrassed 
in 
his 
presence—” 



114 


The 
enormous 
expectation 
in 
sexual 
love 
and 
the 
sense 
of 
shame 
in 
this 
expectation 
spoils 
all 
perspective 
for 
women 
from 
the 
start. 



115 


Where 
neither 
love 
nor 
hatred 
is 
in 
the 
game, 
a 
woman’s 
game 
is 
mediocre. 



116 


The 
great 
epochs 
of 
our 
life 
come 
when 
we 
gain 
the 
courage 
to 
rechristen 
our 
evil 
as 
what 
is 
best 
in 
us. 



117 


The 
will 
to 
overcome 
an 
affect 
is 
ultimately 
only 
the 
will 
of 
another, 
or 
of 
several 
other, 
affects. 



118 


There 
is 
an 
innocence 
in 
admiration; 
it 
is 
found 
in 
those 
to 
whom 
it 
has 
never 
yet 
occurred 
that 
they, 
too, 
might 
be 
admired 
some 
day. 



119 


The 
disgust 
with 
dirt 
can 
be 
so 
great 
that 
it 
keeps 
us 
from 
cleaning 
ourselves—from 
“justifying” 
ourselves. 



120 


Sensuality 
often 
hastens 
the 
growth 
of 
love 
so 
much 
that 
the 
roots 
remain 
weak 
and 
are 
easily 
torn 
up. 



121 


It 
was 
subtle 
of 
God 
to 
learn 
Greek 
when 
he 
wished 
to 
become 
an 
author— 
and 
not 
to 
learn 
it 
better. 



122 


Enjoying 
praise 
is 
in 
some 
people 
merely 
a 
courtesy 
of 
the 
heart—and 
just 
the 
opposite 
of 
vanity 
of 
the 
spirit. 



123 


Even 
concubinage 
has 
been 
corrupted—by 
marriage. 



124 


Whoever 
rejoices 
on 
the 
very 
stake 
triumphs 
not 
over 
pain 
but 
at 
the 
absence 
of 
pain 
that 
he 
had 
expected. 
A 
parable. 



125 


When 
we 
have 
to 
change 
our 
mind 
about 
a 
person, 
we 
hold 
the 
inconvenience 
he 
causes 
us 
very 
much 
against 
him. 



126 


A 
people11 
is 
a 
detour 
of 
nature 
to 
get 
to 
six 
or 
seven 
great 
men.— 
Yes, 
and 
then 
to 
get 
around 
them. 



127 


Science 
offends 
the 
modesty 
of 
all 
real 
women. 
It 
makes 
them 
feel 
as 
if 
one 
wanted 
to 
peep 
under 
their 
skin—yet 
worse, 
under 
their 
dress 
and 
finery. 



128 


The 
more 
abstract 
the 
truth 
is 
that 
you 
would 
teach, 
the 
more 
you 
have 
to 
seduce 
the 
senses 
to 
it. 



129 


The 
devil 
has 
the 
broadest 
perspectives 
for 
God; 
therefore 
he 
keeps 
so 
far 
away 
from 
God—the 
devil 
being 
the 
most 
ancient 
friend 
of 
wisdom. 



130 


What 
a 
man 
is 
begins 
to 
betray 
itself 
when 
his 
talent 
decreases—when 
he 
stops 
showing 
what 
he 
can 
do. 
Talent, 
too, 
is 
finery; 
finery, 
too, 
is 
a 
hiding 
place. 



131 


The 
sexes 
deceive 
themselves 
about 
each 
other—because 
at 
bottom 
they 
honor 
and 
love 
only 
themselves 
(or 
their 
own 
ideal, 
to 
put 
it 
more 
pleasantly). 
Thus 
man 
likes 
woman 
peaceful—but 
woman 
is 
essentially 
unpeaceful, 
like 
a 
cat, 
however 
well 
she 
may 
have 
trained 
herself 
to 
seem 
peaceable. 



132 


One 
is 
best 
punished 
for 
one’s 
virtues. 



133 


Whoever 
does 
not 
know 
how 
to 
find 
the 
way 
to 
his 
ideal 
lives 
more 
frivolously 
and 
impudently 
than 
the 
man 
without 
an 
ideal. 



134 


All 
credibility, 
all 
good 
conscience, 
all 
evidence 
of 
truth 
come 
only 
from 
the 
senses. 



135 


Pharisaism 
is 
not 
a 
degeneration 
in 
a 
good 
man: 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
condition 
of 
all 
being 
good. 



136 


One 
seeks 
a 
midwife 
for 
his 
thoughts, 
another 
someone 
whom 
he 
can 
help: 
origin 
of 
a 
good 
conversation. 



137 


When 
associating 
with 
scholars 
and 
artists 
we 
easily 
miscalculate 
in 
opposite 
directions: 
behind 
a 
remarkable 
scholar 
one 
finds, 
not 
infrequently, 
a 
mediocre 
man, 
and 
behind 
a 
mediocre 
artist 
quite 
often—a 
very 
remarkable 
man. 



138 


When 
we 
are 
awake 
we 
also 
do 
what 
we 
do 
in 
our 
dreams: 
we 
invent 
and 
make 
up 
the 
person 
with 
whom 
we 
associate—and 
immediately 
forget 
it. 



139 


In 
revenge 
and 
in 
love 
woman 
is 
more 
barbarous 
than 
man. 



140 


Rule 
as 
a 
riddle.— 
“If 
the 
bond 
shan’t 
burst—bite 
upon 
it 
first.” 



141 


The 
abdomen 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
man 
does 
not 
easily 
take 
himself 
for 
a 
god. 



142 


The 
chastest 
words 
I 
have 
heard: 
“Dansle 
veritable 
amour 
c’est 
l’âme, 
qui 
enveloppe 
le 
corps.”12 



143 


Our 
vanity 
desires 
that 
what 
we 
do 
best 
should 
be 
considered 
what 
is 
hardest 
for 
us. 
Concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
many 
a 
morality. 



144 


When 
a 
woman 
has 
scholarly 
inclinations 
there 
is 
usually 
something 
wrong 
with 
her 
sexually. 
Sterility 
itself 
disposes 
one 
toward 
a 
certain 
masculinity 
of 
taste; 
for 
man 
is, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so, 
“the 
sterile 
animal.” 



145 


Comparing 
man 
and 
woman 
on 
the 
whole, 
one 
may 
say: 
woman 
would 
not 
have 
the 
genius 
for 
finery 
if 
she 
did 
not 
have 
an 
instinct 
for 
a 
secondary 
role. 



146 


Whoever 
fights 
monsters 
should 
see 
to 
it 
that 
in 
the 
process 
he 
does 
not 
become 
a 
monster. 
And 
when 
you 
look 
long 
into 
an 
abyss, 
the 
abyss 
also 
looks 
into 
you.

From 
old 
Florentine 
novels; 
also—from 
life: 
“Buona 
femmina 
e 
mala 
femmina 
vuol 
bastone.”13 
Sacchetti, 
Nov. 
86. 



148 


Seducing 
one’s 
neighbor 
to 
a 
good 
opinion 
and 
afterwards 
believing 
piously 
in 
this 
opinion—who 
could 
equal 
women 
in 
this 
art?— 



149 


Whata 
time 
experiences 
as 
evil 
is 
usually 
an 
untimely 
echo 
of 
what 
was 
formerly 
experienced 
as 
good—the 
atavism 
of 
a 
more 
ancient 
ideal. 



150 


Around 
the 
hero 
everything 
turns 
into 
a 
tragedy; 
around 
the 
demi-god, 
into 
a 
satyr 
play; 
and 
around 
God—what? 
perhaps 
into 
“world”?— 



151 


Having 
a 
talent 
is 
not 
enough: 
one 
also 
requires 
your 
permission 
for 
it— 
right, 
my 
friends? 



152 


“Where 
the 
tree 
of 
knowledge 
stands, 
there 
is 
always 
Paradise”: 
thus 
speak 
the 
oldest 
and 
the 
youngest 
serpents. 



153 


Whatever 
is 
done 
from 
love 
always 
occurs 
beyond 
good 
and 
evil. 



154 


Objections, 
digressions, 
gay 
mistrust, 
the 
delight 
in 
mockery 
are 
signs 
of 
health: 
everything 
unconditional 
belongs 
in 
pathology. 



155 


The 
sense 
of 
the 
tragic 
gains 
and 
wanes 
with 
sensuality. 



156 


Madness 
is 
rare 
in 
individuals—but 
in 
groups, 
parties, 
nations, 
and 
ages 
it 
is 
the 
rule. 



157 


The 
thought 
of 
suicide 
is 
a 
powerful 
comfort: 
it 
helps 
one 
through 
many 
a 
dreadful 
night. 



158 


To 
our 
strongest 
drive, 
the 
tyrant 
in 
us, 
not 
only 
our 
reason 
bows 
but 
also 
our 
conscience. 



159 


One 
has 
to 
repay 
good 
and 
ill—but 
why 
precisely 
to 
the 
person 
who 
has 
done 
us 
good 
or 
ill? 



160 


One 
no 
longer 
loves 
one’s 
insight 
enough 
once 
one 
communicates 
it. 



161 


Poets 
treat 
their 
experiences 
shamelessly: 
they 
exploit 
them. 



162 


“Our 
neighbor14—is 
not 
our 
neighbor 
but 
his 
neighbor”—thus 
thinks 
every 
nation. 



163 


Love 
brings 
the 
high 
and 
concealed 
characteristics 
of 
the 
lover 
into 
the 
light—what 
is 
rare 
and 
exceptional 
in 
him: 
to 
that 
extent 
it 
easily 
deceives 
regarding 
his 
normality. 



164 


Jesus 
said 
to 
his 
Jews: 
“The 
law 
was 
for 
servants—love 
God 
as 
I 
love 
him, 
as 
his 
son! 
What 
are 
morals 
to 
us 
sons 
of 
God!” 



165 


Regarding 
all 
parties.— 
A 
shepherd 
always 
needs 
a 
bellwether—or 
he 
himself 
must 
occasionally 
be 
a 
wether. 



166 


Even 
when 
the 
mouth 
lies, 
the 
way 
it 
looks 
still 
tells 
the 
truth. 



167 


In 
men 
who 
are 
hard, 
intimacy 
involves 
shame—and 
is 
precious. 



168 


Christianity 
gave 
Eros 
poison 
to 
drink: 
he 
did 
not 
die 
of 
it 
but 
degenerated 
—into 
a 
vice. 



169 


Talking 
much 
about 
oneself 
can 
also 
be 
a 
means 
to 
conceal 
oneself. 



170 


Praise 
is 
more 
obtrusive 
than 
a 
reproach. 



171 


In 
a 
man 
devoted 
to 
knowledge, 
pity 
seems 
almost 
ridiculous, 
like 
delicate 
hands 
on 
a 
cyclops. 



172 


From 
love 
of 
man 
one 
occasionally 
embraces 
someone 
at 
random 
(because 
one 
cannot 
embrace 
all): 
but 
one 
must 
not 
tell 
him 
this— 



173 


One 
does 
not 
hate 
as 
long 
as 
one 
still 
despises, 
but 
only 
those 
whom 
one 
esteems 
equal 
or 
higher. 



174 


You 
utilitarians, 
you, 
too, 
love 
everything 
useful 
only 
as 
a 
vehicle 
for 
your 
inclinations; 
you, 
too, 
really 
find 
the 
noise 
of 
its 
wheels 
insufferable? 



175 


In 
the 
end 
one 
loves 
one’s 
desire 
and 
not 
what 
is 
desired. 



176 


The 
vanity 
of 
others 
offends 
our 
taste 
only 
when 
it 
offends 
our 
vanity. 



177 


Perhaps 
nobody 
yet 
has 
been 
truthful 
enough 
about 
what 
“truthfulness” 
is. 



178 


One 
does 
not 
credit 
clever 
people 
with 
their 
follies: 
what 
a 
loss 
of 
human 
rights! 



179 


The 
consequences 
of 
our 
actions 
take 
hold 
of 
us, 
quite 
indifferent 
to 
our 
claim 
that 
meanwhile 
we 
have 
“improved.” 



180 


There 
is 
an 
innocence 
in 
lying 
which 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
good 
faith 
in 
a 
cause. 



181 


It 
is 
in 
human 
to 
bless 
where 
one 
is 
cursed. 



182 


The 
familiarity 
of 
those 
who 
are 
superior 
embitters 
because 
it 
may 
not 
be 
returned.— 



183 


“Not 
that 
you 
lied 
to 
me, 
but 
that 
I 
no 
longer 
believe 
you, 
has 
shaken 
me”— 



184 


The 
high 
spirits 
of 
kindness 
may 
look 
like 
malice. 



185 


“I 
don’t 
like 
him.”— 
Why?— 
“I 
am 
not 
equal 
to 
him.”— 
Has 
any 
human 
being 
ever 
answered 
that 
way?

In 
the 
original 
edition 
of 
1886 
and 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
1891 
this 
section 
bears 
the 
same 
number 
(65) 
as 
that 
preceding 
it. 
In 
the 
third 
and 
fourth 
editions 
of 
1893 
and 
1894, 
the 
editor 
introduced 
minor 
changes 
and 
renumbered 
all 
the 
sections 
from 
this 
point 
on. 
In 
the 
standard 
editions 
(the 
so-called 
Grossoktav 
and 
the 
Musarion 
editions) 
this 
section 
is 
distinguished 
from 
the 
one 
preceding 
it 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
an 
“a.” 
Schlechta, 
whose 
edition 
of 
the 
works 
in 
three 
volumes 
is 
widely 
considered 
impeccable 
philologically, 
follows 
the 
standard 
editions 
although 
he 
purports 
to 
follow 
the 
edition 
of 
1886. 
Similar 
instances 
will 
be 
noted 
in 
subsequent 
notes.

Scham: 
in 
most 
other 
places 
(see 
sections 
40 
and 
65 
above) 
this 
word 
has 
been 
translated 
as 
“shame.”

of

sections 
that 
put 
one 
in 
mind 
of 
Freud 
include 
3 
above 
and

but 
this 
list 
could 
easily 
be 
lengthened.

Again, 
as 
in 
sections 
49 
and

gratitude 
is 
virtually 
an 
antonym 
of 
resentment.

editions,

of

former

Ein

the

German

NATURAL 
HISTORY 
OF 
MORALS 



Part 
Five 



186 


The 
moral 
sentiment 
in 
Europe 
today 
is 
as 
refined, 
old, 
diverse, 
irritable, 
and 
subtle, 
as 
the 
“science 
of 
morals” 
that 
accompanies 
it 
is 
still 
young, 
raw, 
clumsy, 
and 
butterfingered—an 
attractive 
contrast 
that 
occasionally 
even 
becomes 
visible 
and 
incarnate 
in 
the 
person 
of 
a 
moralist. 
Even 
the 
term 
“science 
of 
morals” 
is 
much 
too 
arrogant 
considering 
what 
it 
designates, 
and 
offends 
good 
taste—which 
always 
prefers 
more 
modest 
terms. 


One 
should 
own 
up 
in 
all 
strictness 
to 
what 
is 
still 
necessary 
here 
for 
a 
long 
time 
to 
come, 
to 
what 
alone 
is 
justified 
so 
far: 
to 
collect 
material, 
to 
conceptualize 
and 
arrange 
a 
vast 
realm 
of 
subtle 
feelings 
of 
value 
and 
differences 
of 
value 
which 
are 
alive, 
grow, 
beget, 
and 
perish—and 
perhaps 
attempts 
to 
present 
vividly 
some 
of 
the 
more 
frequent 
and 
recurring 
forms 
of 
such 
living 
crystallizations—all 
to 
prepare 
a 
typology 
of 
morals. 


To 
be 
sure, 
so 
far 
one 
has 
not 
been 
so 
modest. 
With 
a 
stiff 
seriousness 
that 
inspires 
laughter, 
all 
our 
philosophers 
demanded 
something 
far 
more 
exalted, 
presumptuous, 
and 
solemn 
from 
themselves 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
approached 
the 
study 
of 
morality: 
they 
wanted 
to 
supply 
a 
rational 
foundation 
for 
morality— 
and 
every 
philosopher 
so 
far 
has 
believed 
that 
he 
has 
provided 
such 
a 
foundation. 
Morality 
itself, 
however, 
was 
accepted 
as 
“given.” 
How 
remote 
from 
their 
clumsy 
pride 
was 
that 
task 
which 
they 
considered 
insignificant 
and 
left 
in 
dust 
and 
must—the 
task 
of 
description—although 
the 
subtlest 
fingers 
and 
senses 
can 
scarcely 
be 
subtle 
enough 
for 
it. 


Just 
because 
our 
moral 
philosophers 
knew 
the 
facts 
of 
morality 
only 
very 
approximately 
in 
arbitrary 
extracts 
or 
in 
accidental 
epitomes—for 
example, 
as 
the 
morality 
of 
their 
environment, 
their 
class, 
their 
church, 
the 
spirit 
of 
their 
time, 
their 
climate 
and 
part 
of 
the 
world—just 
because 
they 
were 
poorly 
informed 
and 
not 
even 
very 
curious 
about 
different 
peoples, 
times, 
and 
past 
ages—they 
never 
laid 
eyes 
on 
the 
real 
problems 
of 
morality; 
for 
these 
emerge 
only 
when 
we 
compare 
many 
moralities. 
In 
all 
“science 
of 
morals” 
so 
far 
one 
thing 
was 
lacking, 
strange 
as 
it 
may 
sound: 
the 
problem 
of 
morality 
itself; 
what 
was 
lacking 
was 
any 
suspicion 
that 
there 
was 
something 
problematic 
here. 
What 
the 
philosophers 
called 
“a 
rational 
foundation 
for 
morality” 
and 



tried 
to 
supply 
was, 
seen 
in 
the 
right 
light, 
merely 
a 
scholarly 
variation 
of 
the 
common 
faith 
in 
the 
prevalent 
morality; 
a 
new 
means 
of 
expression 
for 
this 
faith; 
and 
thus 
just 
another 
fact 
within 
a 
particular 
morality; 
indeed, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
a 
kind 
of 
denial 
that 
this 
morality 
might 
ever 
be 
considered 
problematic—certainly 
the 
very 
opposite 
of 
an 
examination, 
analysis, 
questioning, 
and 
vivisection 
of 
this 
very 
faith. 


Listen, 
for 
example, 
with 
what 
almost 
venerable 
innocence 
Schopenhauer 
still 
described 
his 
task, 
and 
then 
draw 
your 
conclusions 
about 
the 
scientific 
standing 
of 
a 
“science” 
whose 
ultimate 
masters 
still 
talk 
like 
children 
and 
little 
old 
women: 
“The 
principle,” 
he 
says 
(p. 
136 
of 
Grundprobleme 
der 
Moral),1“the 
fundamental 
proposition 
on 
whose 
contents 
all 
moral 
philosophers 
are 
really2 
agreed—neminem 
laede, 
immo 
omnes, 
quantum 
potes, 
juva3—that 
is 
really 
the 
proposition 
for 
which 
all 
moralists 
endeavor 
to 
find 
the 
rational 
foundation 
… 
the 
real 
basis 
of 
ethics 
for 
which 
one 
has 
been 
looking 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
as 
for 
the 
philosopher’s 
stone.” 


The 
difficulty 
of 
providing 
a 
rational 
foundation 
for 
the 
principle 
cited 
may 
indeed 
be 
great—as 
is 
well 
known, 
Schopenhauer 
did 
not 
succeed 
either— 
and 
whoever 
has 
once 
felt 
deeply 
how 
insipidly 
false 
and 
sentimental 
this 
principle 
is 
in 
a 
world 
whose 
essence 
is 
will 
to 
power, 
may 
allow 
himself 
to 
be 
reminded 
that 
Schopenhauer, 
though 
a 
pessimist, 
really—played 
the 
flute. 
Every 
day, 
after 
dinner: 
one 
should 
read 
his 
biography 
on 
that. 
And 
incidentally: 
a 
pessimist, 
one 
who 
denies 
God 
and 
the 
world 
but 
comes 
to 
a 
stop 
before 
morality—who 
affirms 
morality 
and 
plays 
the 
flute—the 
laede 
neminem 
morality—what? 
is 
that 
really—a 
pessimist? 



187 


Even 
apart 
from 
the 
value 
of 
such 
claims 
as 
“there 
is 
a 
categorical 
imperative 
in 
us,” 
one 
can 
still 
always 
ask: 
what 
does 
such 
a 
claim 
tell 
us 
about 
the 
man 
who 
makes 
it? 
There 
are 
moralities 
which 
are 
meant 
to 
justify 
their 
creator 
before 
others. 
Other 
moralities 
are 
meant 
to 
calm 
him 
and 
lead 
him 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
himself. 
With 
yet 
others 
he 
wants 
to 
crucify 
himself 
and 
humiliate 
himself. 
With 
others 
he 
wants 
to 
wreak 
revenge, 
with 
others 
conceal 
himself, 
with 
others 
transfigure 
himself 
and 
place 
himself 
way 
up, 
at 
a 
distance. 
This 
morality 
is 
used 
by 
its 
creator 
to 
forget, 
that 
one 
to 
have 
others 
forget 
him 
or 
something 
about 
him. 
Some 
moralists 
want 
to 
vent 
their 
power 
and 
creative 
whims 
on 
humanity; 
some 
others, 
perhaps 
including 
Kant, 
suggest 
with 
their 
morality: 
“What 
deserves 
respect 
in 
me 
is 
that 
I 
can 
obey—and 
you 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
different 
from 
me.”— 
In 
short, 
moralities 
are 
also 
merely 
a 
sign 
language 
of 
the 
affects. 



188 


Every 
morality 
is, 
as 
opposed 
to 
laisser 
aller,4 
a 
bit 
of 
tyranny 
against 
“nature”; 
also 
against 
“reason”; 
but 
this 
in 
itself 
is 
no 
objection, 
as 
long 
as 
we 
do 
not 
have 
some 
other 
morality 
which 
permits 
us 
to 
decree 
that 
every 
kind 
of 
tyranny 
and 
unreason 
is 
impermissible. 
What 
is 
essential 
and 
inestimable 
in 
every 
morality 
is 
that 
it 
constitutes 
a 
long 
compulsion: 
to 
understand 
Stoicism 
or 
Port-Royal 
or 
Puritanism, 
one 
should 
recall 
the 
compulsion 
under 
which 
every 
language 
so 
far 
has 
achieved 
strength 
and 
freedom—the 
metrical 
compulsion 
of 
rhyme 
and 
rhythm. 


Every 
artist 
knows 
how 
far 
from 
any 
feeling 
of 
letting 
himself 
go 
his 
“most 
natural” 
state 
is—the 
free 
ordering, 
placing, 
disposing, 
giving 
form 
in 
the 
moment 
of 
“inspiration”—and 
how 
strictly 
and 
subtly 
he 
obeys 
thousandfold 
laws 
precisely 
then, 
laws 
that 
precisely 
on 
account 
of 
their 
hardness 
and 
determination 
defy 
all 
formulation 
through 
concepts 
(even 
the 
firmest 
concept 
is, 
compared 


How 
much 
trouble 
the 
poets 
and 
orators 
of 
all 
peoples 
have 
taken—not 
excepting 
a 
few 
prose 
writers 
today 
in 
whose 
ear 
there 
dwells 
an 
inexorable 
conscience—“for 
the 
sake 
of 
some 
foolishness,” 
as 
utilitarian 
dolts 
say, 
feeling 
smart—“submitting 
abjectly 
to 
capricious 
laws,” 
as 
anarchists 
say, 
feeling 
“free,” 
even 
“free-spirited.” 
But 
the 
curious 
fact 
is 
that 
all 
there 
is 
or 
has 
been 
on 
earth 
of 
freedom, 
subtlety, 
boldness, 
dance, 
and 
masterly 
sureness, 
whether 
in 
thought 
itself 
or 
in 
government, 
or 
in 
rhetoric 
and 
persuasion, 
in 
the 
arts 
just 
as 
in 
ethics, 
has 
developed 
only 
owing 
to 
the 
“tyranny 
of 
such 
capricious 
laws”; 
and 
in 
all 
seriousness, 
the 
probability 
is 
by 
no 
means 
small 
that 
precisely 
this 
is 
“nature” 
and 
“natural”—and 
not 
that 
laisser 
aller. 
with 
them, 
not 
free 
of 
fluctuation, 
multiplicity, 
and 
ambiguity). 


What 
is 
essential 
“in 
heaven 
and 
on 
earth” 
seems 
to 
be, 
to 
say 
it 
once 
more, 
that 
there 
should 
be 
obedience 
over 
a 
long 
period 
of 
time 
and 
in 
a 
single 
direction: 
given 
that, 
something 
always 
develops, 
and 
has 
developed, 
for 
whose 
sake 
it 
is 
worth 
while 
to 
live 
on 
earth; 
for 
example, 
virtue, 
art, 
music, 
dance, 
reason, 
spirituality—something 
transfiguring, 
subtle, 
mad, 
and 
divine. 
The 
long 
unfreedom 
of 
the 
spirit, 
the 
mistrustful 
constraint 
in 
the 



communicability 
of 
thoughts, 
the 
discipline 
thinkers 
imposed 
on 
themselves 
to 
think 
within 
the 
directions 
laid 
down 
by 
a 
church 
or 
court, 
or 
under 
Aristotelian 
presuppositions, 
the 
long 
spiritual 
will 
to 
interpret 
all 
events 
under 
a 
Christian 
schema 
and 
to 
rediscover 
and 
justify 
the 
Christian 
god 
in 
every 
accident—all 
this, 
however 
forced, 
capricious, 
hard, 
gruesome, 
and 
anti-rational, 
has 
shown 
itself 
to 
be 
the 
means 
through 
which 
the 
European 
spirit 
has 
been 
trained 
to 
strength, 
ruthless 
curiosity, 
and 
subtle 
mobility, 
though 
admittedly 
in 
the 
process 
an 
irreplaceable 
amount 
of 
strength 
and 
spirit 
had 
to 
be 
crushed, 
stifled, 
and 
ruined 
(for 
here, 
as 
everywhere, 
“nature” 
manifests 
herself 
as 
she 
is, 
in 
all 
her 
prodigal 
and 
indifferent 
magnificence 
which 
is 
outrageous 
but 
noble). 


That 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
European 
thinkers 
thought 
merely 
in 
order 
to 
prove 
something—today, 
conversely, 
we 
suspect 
every 
thinker 
who 
“wants 
to 
prove 
something”—that 
the 
conclusions 
that 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
result 
of 
their 
most 
rigorous 
reflection 
were 
always 
settled 
from 
the 
start, 
just 
as 
it 
used 
to 
be 
with 
Asiatic 
astrology, 
and 
still 
is 
today 
with 
the 
innocuous 
Christian-
moral 
interpretation 
of 
our 
most 
intimate 
personal 
experiences 
“for 
the 
glory 
of 
God” 
and 
“for 
the 
salvation 
of 
the 
soul”—this 
tyranny, 
this 
caprice, 
this 
rigorous 
and 
grandiose 
stupidity 
has 
educated 
the 
spirit. 
Slavery 
is, 
as 
it 
seems, 
both 
in 
the 
cruder 
and 
in 
the 
more 
subtle 
sense, 
the 
indispensable 
means 
of 
spiritual 
discipline 
and 
cultivation,5 
too. 
Consider 
any 
morality 
with 
this 
in 
mind: 
what 
there 
is 
in 
it 
of 
“nature” 
teaches 
hatred 
of 
the 
laisser 
aller, 
of 
any 
all-too-great 
freedom, 
and 
implants 
the 
need 
for 
limited 
horizons 
and 
the 
nearest 
tasks—teaching 
the 
narrowing 
of 
our 
perspective, 
and 
thus 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
stupidity, 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
life 
and 
growth. 


“You 
shall 
obey—someone 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time: 
else 
you 
will 
perish 
and 
lose 
the 
last 
respect 
for 
yourself”—this 
appears 
to 
me 
to 
be 
the 
moral 
imperative 
of 
nature 
which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
is 
neither 
“categorical” 
as 
the 
old 
Kant 
would 
have 
it 
(hence 
the 
“else”) 
nor 
addressed 
to 
the 
individual 
(what 
do 
individuals 
matter 
to 
her?), 
but 
to 
peoples, 
races, 
ages, 
classes—but 
above 
all 
to 
the 
whole 
human 
animal, 
to 
man. 



189 


Industrious 
races 
find 
it 
very 
troublesome 
to 
endure 
leisure: 
it 
was 
a 
masterpiece 
of 
English 
instinct 
to 
make 
the 
Sabbath 
so 
holy 
and 
so 
boring 
that 
the 
English 
begin 
unconsciously 
to 
lust 
again 
for 
their 
work-and 
weekday. 
It 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
cleverly 
invented, 
cleverly 
inserted 
fast, 
the 
like 
of 
which 
is 
also 
encountered 
frequently 
in 
the 
ancient 
world 
(although, 
in 
fairness 
to 
southern 
peoples, 
not 
exactly 
in 
regard 
to 
work). 
There 
have 
to 
be 
fasts 
of 
many 
kinds; 
and 
wherever 
powerful 
drives 
and 
habits 
prevail, 
legislators 
have 
to 
see 
to 
it 
that 
intercalary 
days 
are 
inserted 
on 
which 
such 
a 
drive 
is 
chained 
and 
learns 
again 
to 
hunger. 
Viewed 
from 
a 
higher 
vantage 
point, 
whole 
generations 
and 
ages 
that 
make 
their 
appearance, 
infected 
with 
some 
moral 
fanaticism, 
seem 
to 
be 
such 
times 
of 
constraint 
and 
fasting 
during 
which 
a 
drive 
learns 
to 
stoop 
and 
submit, 
but 
also 
to 
purify 
and 
sharpen 
itself. 
A 
few 
philosophical 
sects, 
too, 
permit 
such 
an 
interpretation 
(for 
example, 
the 
Stoa 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
Hellenistic 
culture 
with 
its 
lascivious 
atmosphere, 
overcharged 
with 
aphrodisiac 
odors). 


This 
is 
also 
a 
hint 
for 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
paradox: 
why 
it 
was 
precisely 
during 
the 
most 
Christian 
period 
of 
Europe 
and 
altogether 
only 
under 
the 
pressure 
of 
Christian 
value 
judgments 
that 
the 
sex 
drive 
sublimated6 
itself 
into 
love 
(amour-passion). 



190 


There 
is 
something 
in 
the 
morality 
of 
Plato 
that 
does 
not 
really 
belong 
to 
Plato 
but 
is 
merely 
encountered 
in 
his 
philosophy—one 
might 
say, 
in 
spite 
of 
Plato: 
namely, 
the 
Socratism 
for 
which 
he 
was 
really 
too 
noble. 
“Nobody 
wants 
to 
do 
harm 
to 
himself, 
therefore 
all 
that 
is 
bad 
is 
done 
involuntarily. 
For 
the 
bad 
do 
harm 
to 
themselves: 
this 
they 
would 
not 
do 
if 
they 
knew 
that 
the 
bad 
is 
bad. 
Hence 
the 
bad 
are 
bad 
only 
because 
of 
an 
error; 
if 
one 
removes 
the 
error, 
one 
necessarily 
makes 
them—good.” 


This 
type 
of 
inference 
smells 
of 
the 
rabble 
that 
sees 
nothing 
in 
bad 
actions 
but 
the 
unpleasant 
consequences 
and 
really 
judges, 
“it 
is 
stupid 
to 
do 
what 
is 
bad,” 
while 
“good” 
is 
taken 
without 
further 
ado 
to 
be 
identical 
with 
“useful 
and 
agreeable.” 
In 
the 
case 
of 
every 
moral 
utilitarianism 
one 
may 
immediately 
infer 
the 
same 
origin 
and 
follow 
one’s 
nose: 
one 
will 
rarely 
go 
astray. 


Plato 
did 
everything 
he 
could 
in 
order 
to 
read 
something 
refined 
and 
noble 
into 
the 
proposition 
of 
his 
teacher—above 
all, 
himself. 
He 
was 
the 
most 
audacious 
of 
all 
interpreters 
and 
took 
the 
whole 
Socrates 
only 
the 
way 
one 
picks 
a 
popular 
tune 
and 
folk 
song 
from 
the 
streets 
in 
order 
to 
vary 
it 
into 
the 
infinite 
and 
impossible—namely, 
into 
all 
of 
his 
own 
masks 
and 
multiplicities. 
In 
a 
jest, 
Homeric 
at 
that: 
what 
is 
the 
Platonic 
Socrates

The 
ancient 
theological 
problem 
of 
“faith” 
and 
“knowledge”—or, 
more 
clearly, 
of 
instinct 
and 
reason—in 
other 
words, 
the 
question 
whether 
regarding 
the 
valuation 
of 
things 
instinct 
deserves 
more 
authority 
than 
rationality, 
which 
wants 
us 
to 
evaluate 
and 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
reasons, 
with 
a 
“why?”—in 
other 
words, 
in 
accordance 
with 
expedience 
and 
utility— 
this 
is 
still 
the 
ancient 
moral 
problem 
that 
first 
emerged 
in 
the 
person 
of 
Socrates 
and 
divided 
thinking 
people 
long 
before 
Christianity. 
Socrates 
himself, 
to 
be 
sure, 
with 
the 
taste 
of 
his 
talent—that 
of 
a 
superior 
dialectician 
—had 
initially 
sided 
with 
reason; 
and 
in 
fact, 
what 
did 
he 
do 
his 
life 
long 
but 
laugh 
at 
the 
awkward 
incapacity 
of 
noble 
Athenians 
who, 
like 
all 
noble 
men, 
were 
men 
of 
instinct 
and 
never 
could 
give 
sufficient 
information 
about 
the 
reasons 
for 
their 
actions? 
In 
the 
end, 
however, 
privately 
and 
secretly, 
he 
laughed 
at 
himself, 
too: 
in 
himself 
he 
found, 
before 
his 
subtle 
conscience 
and 
self-examination, 
the 
same 
difficulty 
and 
incapacity. 
But 
is 
that 
any 
reason, 
he 
encouraged 
himself, 
for 
giving 
up 
the 
instincts? 
One 
has 
to 
see 
to 
it 
that 
they 
as 
well 
as 
reason 
receive 
their 
due—one 
must 
follow 
the 
instincts 
but 
persuade 
reason 
to 
assist 
them 
with 
good 
reasons. 
This 
was 
the 
real 
falseness 
of 
that 
great 
ironic, 
so 
rich 
in 
secrets; 
he 
got 
his 
conscience 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
self-trickery: 
at 
bottom, 
he 
had 
seen 
through 
the 
irrational 
element 
in 
moral 
judgments. 


Plato, 
more 
innocent 
in 
such 
matters 
and 
lacking 
the 
craftiness 
of 
the 
plebeian, 
wanted 
to 
employ 
all 
his 
strength—the 
greatest 
strength 
any 
philosopher 
so 
far 
has 
had 
at 
his 
disposal—to 
prove 
to 
himself 
that 
reason 
and 
instinct 
of 
themselves 
tend 
toward 
one 
goal, 
the 
good, 
“God.” 
And 
since 
Plato, 
all 
theologians 
and 
philosophers 
are 
on 
the 
same 
track—that 
is, 
in 
moral 
matters 
it 
has 
so 
far 
been 
instinct, 
or 
what 
the 
Christians 
call 
“faith,” 
or 
“the 
herd,” 
as 
I 
put 
it, 
that 
has 
triumphed. 
Perhaps 
Descartes 
should 
be 
excepted, 
as 
the 
father 
of 
rationalism 
(and 
hence 
the 
grandfather 
of 
the 
Revolution) 
who 
conceded 
authority 
to 
reason 
alone: 
but 
reason 
is 
merely 
an 
instrument, 
and 
Descartes 
was 
superficial.

Whoever 
has 
traced 
the 
history 
of 
an 
individual 
science 
finds 
a 
clue 
in 
its 
development 
for 
understanding 
the 
most 
ancient 
and 
common 
processes 
of 
all 
“knowledge 
and 
cognition.” 
There 
as 
here 
it 
is 
the 
rash 
hypotheses, 
the 
fictions, 
the 
good 
dumb 
will 
to 
“believe,” 
the 
lack 
of 
mistrust 
and 
patience 
that 
are 
developed 
first; 
our 
senses 
learn 
only 
late, 
and 
never 
learn 
entirely, 
to 
be 
subtle, 
faithful, 
and 
cautious 
organs 
of 
cognition. 
Our 
eye 
finds 
it 
more 
comfortable 
to 
respond 
to 
a 
given 
stimulus 
by 
reproducing 
once 
more 
an 
image 
that 
it 
has 
produced 
many 
times 
before, 
instead 
of 
registering 
what 
is 
different 
and 
new 
in 
an 
impression. 
The 
latter 
would 
require 
more 
strength, 
more 
“morality.” 
Hearing 
something 
new 
is 
embarrassing 
and 
difficult 
for 
the 
ear; 
foreign 
music 
we 
do 
not 
hear 
well. 
When 
we 
hear 
another 
language 
we 
try 
involuntarily 
to 
form 
the 
sounds 
we 
hear 
into 
words 
that 
sound 
more 
familiar 
and 
more 
like 
home 
to 
us: 
thus 
the 
German, 
for 
example, 
transformed 
arcubalista, 
when 
he 
heard 
that, 
into 
Armbrust.8 
What 
is 
new 
finds 
our 
senses, 
too, 
hostile 
and 
reluctant; 
and 
even 
in 
the 
“simplest” 
processes 
of 
sensation 
the 
affects 
dominate, 
such 
as 
fear, 
love, 
hatred, 
including 
the 
passive 
affects 
of 
laziness. 


Just 
as 
little 
as 
a 
reader 
today 
reads 
all 
of 
the 
individual 
words 
(let 
alone 
syllables) 
on 
a 
page—rather 
he 
picks 
about 
five 
words 
at 
random 
out 
of 
twenty 
and 
“guesses” 
at 
the 
meaning 
that 
probably 
belongs 
to 
these 
five 
words—just 
as 
little 
do 
we 
see 
a 
tree 
exactly 
and 
completely 
with 
reference 
to 
leaves, 
twigs, 
color, 
and 
form; 
it 
is 
so 
very 
much 
easier 
for 
us 
simply 
to 
improvise 
some 
approximation 
of 
a 
tree. 
Even 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
strangest 
experiences 
we 
still 
do 
the 
same: 
we 
make 
up 
the 
major 
part 
of 
the 
experience 
and 
can 
scarcely 
be 
forced 
not 
to 
contemplate 
some 
event 
as 
its 
“inventors.” 
All 
this 
means: 
basically 
and 
from 
time 
immemorial 
we 
are 
—accustomed 
to 
lying. 
Or 
to 
put 
it 
more 
virtuously 
and 
hypocritically, 
in 
short, 
more 
pleasantly: 
one 
is 
much 
more 
of 
an 
artist 
than 
one 
knows. 


In 
an 
animated 
conversation 
I 
often 
see 
the 
face 
of 
the 
person 
with 
whom 
I 
am 
talking 
so 
clearly 
and 
so 
subtly 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
thought 
he 
expresses, 
or 
that 
I 
believe 
has 
been 
produced 
in 
him, 
that 
this 



degree 
of 
clarity 
far 
surpasses 
my 
powers 
of 
vision: 
so 
the 
subtle 
shades 
of 
the 
play 
of 
the 
muscles 
and 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
eyes 
must 
have 
been 
made 
up 
by 
me. 
Probably 
the 
person 
made 
an 
altogether 
different 
face, 
or 
none 
at 
all. 



193 


Quidquid 
luce 
fuit, 
tenebris 
agit:9 
but 
the 
other 
way 
around, 
too. 
What 
we 
experience 
in 
dreams—assuming 
that 
we 
experience 
it 
often—belongs 
in 
the 
end 
just 
as 
much 
to 
the 
over-all 
economy 
of 
our 
soul 
as 
anything 
experienced 
“actually”: 
we 
are 
richer 
or 
poorer 
on 
account 
of 
it, 
have 
one 
need 
more 
or 
less, 
and 
finally 
are 
led 
a 
little 
by 
the 
habits 
of 
our 
dreams 
even 
in 
broad 
daylight 
and 
in 
the 
most 
cheerful 
moments 
of 
our 
wide-awake 
spirit. 


Suppose 
someone 
has 
flown 
often 
in 
his 
dreams 
and 
finally, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
dreams, 
he 
is 
conscious 
of 
his 
power 
and 
art 
of 
flight 
as 
if 
it 
were 
his 
privilege, 
also 
his 
characteristic 
and 
enviable 
happiness. 
He 
believes 
himself 
capable 
of 
realizing 
every 
kind 
of 
arc 
and 
angle 
simply 
with 
the 
lightest 
impulse; 
he 
knows 
the 
feeling 
of 
a 
certain 
divine 
frivolity, 
an 
“upward” 
without 
tension 
and 
constraint, 
a 
“downward” 
without 
condescension 
and 
humiliation—without 
gravity! 
How 
could 
a 
human 
being 
who 
had 
had 
such 
dream 
experiences 
and 
dream 
habits 
fail 
to 
find 
that 
the 
word 
“happiness” 
had 
a 
different 
color 
and 
definition 
in 
his 
waking 
life, 
too? 
How 
could 
he 
fail 
to—desire 
happiness 
differently? 
“Rising” 
as 
described 
by 
poets 
must 
seem 
to 
him, 
compared 
with 
this 
“flying,” 
too 
earthbound, 
muscle-bound, 
forced, 
too 
“grave.” 



194 


The 
difference 
among 
men 
becomes 
manifest 
not 
only 
in 
the 
difference 
between 
their 
tablets 
of 
goods—in 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
consider 
different 
goods 
worth 
striving 
for 
and 
also 
disagree 
about 
what 
is 
more 
and 
less 
valuable, 
about 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
of 
the 
goods 
they 
recognize 
in 
common—it 
becomes 
manifest 
even 
more 
in 
what 
they 
take 
for 
really 
having 
and 
possessing 
something 
good. 


Regarding 
a 
woman, 
for 
example, 
those 
men 
who 
are 
more 
modest 
consider 
the 
mere 
use 
of 
the 
body 
and 
sexual 
gratification 
a 
sufficient 
and 
satisfying 
sign 
of 
“having,” 
of 
possession. 
Another 
type, 
with 
a 
more 
suspicious 
and 
demanding 
thirst 
for 
possession, 
sees 
the 
“question 
mark,” 
the 
illusory 
quality 
of 
such 
“having” 
and 
wants 
subtler 
tests, 
above 
all 
in 
order 
to 
know 
whether 
the 
woman 
does 
not 
only 
give 
herself 
to 
him 
but 
also 
gives 
up 
for 
his 
sake 
what 
she 
has 
or 
would 
like 
to 
have: 
only 
then 
does 
she 
seem 
to 
him 
“possessed.” 
A 
third 
type, 
however, 
does 
not 
reach 
the 
end 
of 
his 
mistrust 
and 
desire 
for 
having 
even 
so: 
he 
asks 
himself 
whether 
the 
woman, 
when 
she 
gives 
up 
everything 
for 
him, 
does 
not 
possibly 
do 
this 
for 
a 
phantom 
of 
him. 
He 
wants 
to 
be 
known 
deep 
down, 
abysmally 
deep 
down, 
before 
he 
is 
capable 
of 
being 
loved 
at 
all; 
he 
dares 
to 
let 
himself 
be 
fathomed. 
He 
feels 
that 
his 
beloved 
is 
fully 
in 
his 
possession 
only 
when 
she 
no 
longer 
deceives 
herself 
about 
him, 
when 
she 
loves 
him 
just 
as 
much 
for 
his 
devilry 
and 
hidden 
insatiability 
as 
for 
his 
graciousness, 
patience, 
and 
spirituality. 


One 
type 
wants 
to 
possess 
a 
people—and 
all 
the 
higher 
arts 
of 
a 
Cagliostro 
and 
Catiline 
suit 
him 
to 
that 
purpose. 
Someone 
else, 
with 
a 
more 
subtle 
thirst 
for 
possession, 
says 
to 
himself: 
“One 
may 
not 
deceive 
where 
one 
wants 
to 
possess.” 
The 
idea 
that 
a 
mask 
of 
him 
might 
command 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
people10 
irritates 
him 
and 
makes 
him 
impatient: 
“So 
I 
must 
let 
myself 
be 
known, 
and 
first 
must 
know 
myself.” 


Among 
helpful 
and 
charitable 
people 
one 
almost 
regularly 
encounters 
that 
clumsy 
ruse 
which 
first 
doctors 
the 
person 
to 
be 
helped—as 
if, 
for 
example, 
he 
“deserved” 
help, 
required 
just 
their 
help, 
and 
would 
prove 
to 
be 
profoundly 
grateful 
for 
all 
help, 
faithful 
and 
submissive. 
With 
these 
fancies 



they 
dispose 
of 
the 
needy 
as 
of 
possessions, 
being 
charitable 
and 
helpful 
people 
from 
a 
desire 
for 
possessions. 
One 
finds 
them 
jealous 
if 
one 
crosses 
or 
anticipates 
them 
when 
they 
want 
to 
help. 


Involuntarily, 
parents 
turn 
children 
into 
something 
similar 
to 
themselves— 
they 
call 
that 
“education.” 
Deep 
in 
her 
heart, 
no 
mother 
doubts 
that 
the 
child 
she 
has 
borne 
is 
her 
property; 
no 
father 
contests 
his 
own 
right 
to 
subject 
it 
to 
his 
concepts 
and 
valuations. 
Indeed, 
formerly 
it 
seemed 
fair 
for 
fathers 
(among 
the 
ancient 
Germans, 
for 
example) 
to 
decide 
on 
the 
life 
or 
death 
of 
the 
newborn 
as 
they 
saw 
fit. 
And 
like 
the 
father, 
teachers, 
classes, 
priests, 
and 
princes 
still 
see, 
even 
today, 
in 
every 
new 
human 
being 
an 
unproblematic 
opportunity 
for 
another 
possession. 
So 
it 
follows—— 



195 


The 
Jews—a 
people 
“born 
for 
slavery,” 
as 
Tacitus 
and 
the 
whole 
ancient 
world 
say; 
“the 
chosen 
people 
among 
the 
peoples,” 
as 
they 
themselves 
say 
and 
believe—the 
Jews 
have 
brought 
off 
that 
miraculous 
feat 
of 
an 
inversion 
of 
values, 
thanks 
to 
which 
life 
on 
earth 
has 
acquired 
a 
novel 
and 
dangerous 
attraction 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
millennia: 
their 
prophets 
have 
fused 
“rich,” 
“godless,” 
“evil,” 
“violent,” 
and 
“sensual” 
into 
one 
and 
were 
the 
first 
to 
use 
the 
word 
“world” 
as 
an 
opprobrium. 
This 
inversion 
of 
values 
(which 
includes 
using 
the 
word 
“poor” 
as 
synonymous 
with 
“holy” 
and 
“friend”) 
constitutes 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
Jewish 
people: 
they 
mark 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
slave 
rebellion 
in 
morals.11 



196 


Countless 
dark 
bodies 
are 
to 
be 
inferred 
near 
the 
sun—and 
we 
shall 
never 
see 
them. 
Among 
ourselves, 
this 
is 
a 
parable; 
and 
a 
psychologist 
of 
morals 
reads 
the 
whole 
writing 
of 
the 
stars 
only 
as 
a 
parable-and 
sign-language 
which 
can 
be 
used 
to 
bury 
much 
in 
silence. 



197 


We 
misunderstand 
the 
beast 
of 
prey 
and 
the 
man 
of 
prey 
(for 
example, 
Cesare 
Borgia)12 
thoroughly, 
we 
misunderstand 
“nature,” 
as 
long 
as 
we 
still 
look 
for 
something 
“pathological” 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
these 
healthiest 
of 
all 
tropical 
monsters 
and 
growths, 
or 
even 
for 
some 
“hell” 
that 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
innate 
in 
them; 
yet 
this 
is 
what 
almost 
all 
moralists 
so 
far 
have 
done. 
Could 
it 
be 
that 
moralists 
harbor 
a 
hatred 
of 
the 
primeval 
forest 
and 
the 
tropics? 
And 
that 
the 
“tropical 
man” 
must 
be 
discredited 
at 
any 
price, 
whether 
as 
sickness 
and 
degeneration 
of 
man 
or 
as 
his 
own 
hell 
and 
self-torture? 
Why? 
In 
favor 
of 
the 
“temperate 
zones”? 
In 
favor 
of 
temperate 
men? 
Of 
those 
who 
are 
“moral”? 
Who 
are 
mediocre?— 
This 
for 
the 
chapter 
“Morality 
as 
Timidity.” 



198 


All 
these 
moralities 
that 
address 
themselves 
to 
the 
individual, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
his 
“happiness,” 
as 
one 
says—what 
are 
they 
but 
counsels 
for 
behavior 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
dangerousness 
in 
which 
the 
individual 
lives 
with 
himself; 
recipes 
against 
his 
passions, 
his 
good 
and 
bad 
inclinations 
insofar 
as 
they 
have 
the 
will 
to 
power 
and 
want 
to 
play 
the 
master; 
little 
and 
great 
prudences 
and 
artifices 
that 
exude 
the 
nook 
odor 
of 
old 
nostrums 
and 
of 
the 
wisdom 
of 
old 
women; 
all 
of 
them 
baroque 
and 
unreasonable 
in 
form— 
because 
they 
address 
themselves 
to 
“all,” 
because 
they 
generalize 
where 
one 
must 
not 
generalize. 
All 
of 
them 
speak 
unconditionally, 
take 
themselves 
for 
unconditional, 
all 
of 
them 
flavored 
with 
more 
than 
one 
grain 
of 
salt 
and 
tolerable 
only—at 
times 
even 
seductive—when 
they 
begin 
to 
smell 
over-
spiced 
and 
dangerous, 
especially 
“of 
the 
other 
world.” 
All 
of 
it 
is, 
measured 
intellectually, 
worth 
very 
little 
and 
not 
by 
a 
long 
shot 
“science,” 
much 
less 
“wisdom,” 
but 
rather, 
to 
say 
it 
once 
more, 
three 
times 
more, 
prudence, 
prudence, 
prudence, 
mixed 
with 
stupidity, 
stupidity, 
stupidity—whether 
it 
be 
that 
indifference 
and 
statue 
coldness 
against 
the 
hot-headed 
folly 
of 
the 
affects 
which 
the 
Stoics 
advised 
and 
administered; 
or 
that 
laughing-no-more 
and 
weeping-no-more 
of 
Spinoza, 
his 
so 
naïvely 
advocated 
destruction 
of 
the 
affects 
through 
their 
analysis 
and 
vivisection; 
or 
that 
tuning 
down 
of 
the 
affects 
to 
a 
harmless 
mean 
according 
to 
which 
they 
may 
be 
satisfied, 
the 
Aristotelianism 
of 
morals; 
even 
morality 
as 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
affects 
in 
a 
deliberate 
thinness 
and 
spiritualization 
by 
means 
of 
the 
symbolism 
of 
art, 
say, 
as 
music, 
or 
as 
love 
of 
God 
and 
of 
man 
for 
God’s 
sake—for 
in 
religion 
the 
passions 
enjoy 
the 
rights 
of 
citizens 
again, 
assuming 
that——; 
finally 
even 
that 
accommodating 
and 
playful 
surrender 
to 
the 
affects, 
as 
Hafiz 
and 
Goethe 
taught 
it, 
that 
bold 
dropping 
of 
the 
reins, 
that 
spiritual-physical 
licentia 
morum13 
in 
the 
exceptional 
case 
of 
wise 
old 
owls 
and 
sots14 
for 
whom 
it 
“no 
longer 
holds 
much 
danger.” 
This, 
too, 
for 
the 
chapter 
“Morality 
as 
Timidity.” 



199 


Inasmuch 
as 
at 
all 
times, 
as 
long 
as 
there 
have 
been 
human 
beings, 
there 
have 
also 
been 
herds 
of 
men 
(clans, 
communities, 
tribes, 
peoples, 
states, 
churches) 
and 
always 
a 
great 
many 
people 
who 
obeyed, 
compared 
with 
the 
small 
number 
of 
those 
commanding—considering, 
then, 
that 
nothing 
has 
been 
exercised 
and 
cultivated 
better 
and 
longer 
among 
men 
so 
far 
than 
obedience—it 
may 
fairly 
be 
assumed 
that 
the 
need 
for 
it 
is 
now 
innate 
in 
the 
average 
man, 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
formal 
conscience 
that 
commands: 
“thou 
shalt 
unconditionally 
do 
something, 
unconditionally 
not 
do 
something 
else,” 
in 
short, 
“thou 
shalt.” 
This 
need 
seeks 
to 
satisfy 
itself 
and 
to 
fill 
its 
form 
with 
some 
content. 
According 
to 
its 
strength, 
impatience, 
and 
tension, 
it 
seizes 
upon 
things 
as 
a 
rude 
appetite, 
rather 
indiscriminately, 
and 
accepts 
whatever 
is 
shouted 
into 
its 
ears 
by 
someone 
who 
issues 
commands—parents, 
teachers, 
laws, 
class 
prejudices, 
public 
opinions. 


The 
strange 
limits 
of 
human 
development, 
the 
way 
it 
hesitates, 
takes 
so 
long, 
often 
turns 
back, 
and 
moves 
in 
circles, 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
herd 
instinct 
of 
obedience 
is 
inherited 
best, 
and 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
art 
of 
commanding. 
If 
we 
imagine 
this 
instinct 
progressing 
for 
once 
to 
its 
ultimate 
excesses, 
then 
those 
who 
command 
and 
are 
independent 
would 
eventually 
be 
lacking 
altogether; 
or 
they 
would 
secretly 
suffer 
from 
a 
bad 
conscience 
and 
would 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
deceive 
themselves 
before 
they 
could 
command— 
as 
if 
they, 
too, 
merely 
obeyed. 
This 
state 
is 
actually 
encountered 
in 
Europe 
today: 
I 
call 
it 
the 
moral 
hypocrisy 
of 
those 
commanding. 
They 
know 
no 
other 
way 
to 
protect 
themselves 
against 
their 
bad 
conscience 
than 
to 
pose 
as 
the 
executors 
of 
more 
ancient 
or 
higher 
commands 
(of 
ancestors, 
the 
constitution, 
of 
right, 
the 
laws, 
or 
even 
of 
God). 
Or 
they 
even 
borrow 
herd 
maxims 
from 
the 
herd’s 
way 
of 
thinking, 
such 
as 
“first 
servants 
of 
their 
people” 
or 
“instruments 
of 
the 
common 
weal.” 


On 
the 
other 
side, 
the 
herd 
man 
in 
Europe 
today 
gives 
himself 
the 
appearance 
of 
being 
the 
only 
permissible 
kind 
of 
man, 
and 
glorifies 
his 
attributes, 
which 
make 
him 
tame, 
easy 
to 
get 
along 
with, 
and 
useful 
to 
the 
herd, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
the 
truly 
human 
virtues: 
namely, 
public 
spirit, 
benevolence, 
consideration, 
industriousness, 
moderation, 
modesty, 



indulgence, 
and 
pity. 
In 
those 
cases, 
however, 
where 
one 
considers 
leaders 
and 
bellwethers 
indispensable, 
people 
today 
make 
one 
attempt 
after 
another 
to 
add 
together 
clever 
herd 
men 
by 
way 
of 
replacing 
commanders: 
all 
parliamentary 
constitutions, 
for 
example, 
have 
this 
origin. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
appearance 
of 
one 
who 
commands 
unconditionally 
strikes 
these 
herd-animal 
Europeans 
as 
an 
immense 
comfort 
and 
salvation 
from 
a 
gradually 
intolerable 
pressure, 
as 
was 
last 
attested 
in 
a 
major 
way 
by 
the 
effect 
of 
Napoleon’s 
appearance. 
The 
history 
of 
Napoleon’s 
reception 
is 
almost 
the 
history 
of 
the 
higher 
happiness 
attained 
by 
this 
whole 
century 
in 
its 
most 
valuable 
human 
beings 
and 
moments. 



200 


In 
an 
age 
of 
disintegration 
that 
mixes 
races 
indiscriminately, 
human 
beings 
have 
in 
their 
bodies 
the 
heritage 
of 
multiple 
origins, 
that 
is, 
opposite, 
and 
often 
not 
merely 
opposite, 
drives 
and 
value 
standards 
that 
fight 
each 
other 
and 
rarely 
permit 
each 
other 
any 
rest. 
Such 
human 
beings 
of 
late 
cultures 
and 
refracted 
lights 
will 
on 
the 
average 
be 
weaker 
human 
beings: 
their 
most 
profound 
desire 
is 
that 
the 
war 
they 
are 
should 
come 
to 
an 
end. 
Happiness 
appears 
to 
them, 
in 
agreement 
with 
a 
tranquilizing 
(for 
example, 
Epicurean 
or 
Christian) 
medicine 
and 
way 
of 
thought, 
pre-eminently 
as 
the 
happiness 
of 
resting, 
of 
not 
being 
disturbed, 
of 
satiety, 
of 
finally 
attained 
unity, 
as 
a 
“sabbath 
of 
sabbaths,” 
to 
speak 
with 
the 
holy 
rhetorician 
Augustine 
who 
was 
himself 
such 
a 
human 
being. 


But 
when 
the 
opposition 
and 
war 
in 
such 
a 
nature 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
one 
more 
charm 
and 
incentive 
of 
life—and 
if, 
moreover, 
in 
addition 
to 
his 
powerful 
and 
irreconcilable 
drives, 
a 
real 
mastery 
and 
subtlety 
in 
waging 
war 
against 
oneself, 
in 
other 
words, 
self-control, 
self-outwitting, 
has 
been 
inherited 
or 
cultivated, 
too—then 
those 
magical, 
incomprehensible, 
and 
unfathomable 
ones 
arise, 
those 
enigmatic 
men 
predestined 
for 
victory 
and 
seduction, 
whose 
most 
beautiful 
expression 
is 
found 
in 
Alcibiades 
and 
Caesar 
(to 
whose 
company 
I 
should 
like 
to 
add 
that 
first 
European 
after 
my 
taste, 
the 
Hohenstaufen 
Frederick 
II),15 
and 
among 
artists 
perhaps 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci. 
They 
appear 
in 
precisely 
the 
same 
ages 
when 
that 
weaker 
type 
with 
its 
desire 
for 
rest 
comes 
to 
the 
fore: 
both 
types 
belong 
together 
and 
owe 
their 
origin 
to 
the 
same 
causes.

As 
long 
as 
the 
utility 
reigning 
in 
moral 
value 
judgments 
is 
solely 
the 
utility 
of 
the 
herd, 
as 
long 
as 
one 
considers 
only 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
community, 
and 
immorality 
is 
sought 
exactly 
and 
exclusively 
in 
what 
seems 
dangerous 
to 
the 
survival 
of 
the 
community—there 
can 
be 
no 
morality 
of 
“neighbor 
love.” 
Supposing 
that 
even 
then 
there 
was 
a 
constant 
little 
exercise 
of 
consideration-
pity, 
fairness, 
mildness, 
reciprocity 
of 
assistance; 
supposing 
that 
even 
in 
that 
state 
of 
society 
all 
those 
drives 
are 
active 
that 
later 
receive 
the 
honorary 
designation 
of 
“virtues” 
and 
eventually 
almost 
coincide 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
“morality”—in 
that 
period 
they 
do 
not 
yet 
at 
all 
belong 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
moral 
valuations; 
they 
are 
still 
extra-moral. 
An 
act 
of 
pity, 
for 
example, 
was 
not 
considered 
either 
good 
or 
bad, 
moral 
or 
immoral, 
in 
the 
best 
period 
of 
the 
Romans; 
and 
even 
when 
it 
was 
praised, 
such 
praise 
was 
perfectly 
compatible 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
disgruntled 
disdain 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
was 
juxtaposed 
with 
an 
action 
that 
served 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
whole, 
of 
the 
res 
publica.16 


In 
the 
last 
analysis, 
“love 
of 
the 
neighbor” 
is 
always 
something 
secondary, 
partly 
conventional 
and 
arbitrary-illusory 
in 
relation 
to 
fear 
of 
the 
neighbor. 
After 
the 
structure 
of 
society 
is 
fixed 
on 
the 
whole 
and 
seems 
secure 
against 
external 
dangers, 
it 
is 
this 
fear 
of 
the 
neighbor 
that 
again 
creates 
new 
perspectives 
of 
moral 
valuation. 
Certain 
strong 
and 
dangerous 
drives, 
like 
an 
enterprising 
spirit, 
foolhardiness, 
vengefulness, 
craftiness, 
rapacity, 
and 
the 
lust 
to 
rule, 
which 
had 
so 
far 
not 
merely 
been 
honored 
insofar 
as 
they 
were 
socially 
useful—under 
different 
names, 
to 
be 
sure, 
from 
those 
chosen 
here— 
but 
had 
to 
be 
trained 
and 
cultivated 
to 
make 
them 
great 
(because 
one 
constantly 
needed 
them 
in 
view 
of 
the 
dangers 
to 
the 
whole 
community, 
against 
the 
enemies 
of 
the 
community), 
are 
now 
experienced 
as 
doubly 
dangerous, 
since 
the 
channels 
to 
divert 
them 
are 
lacking, 
and, 
step 
upon 
step, 
they 
are 
branded 
as 
immoral 
and 
abandoned 
to 
slander. 


Now 
the 
opposite 
drives 
and 
inclinations 
receive 
moral 
honors; 
step 
upon 
step, 
the 
herd 
instinct 
draws 
its 
conclusions. 
How 
much 
or 
how 
little 
is 
dangerous 
to 
the 
community, 
dangerous 
to 
equality, 
in 
an 
opinion, 
in 
a 
state 
or 
affect, 
in 
a 
will, 
in 
a 
talent—that 
now 
constitutes 
the 
moral 
perspective: 



here, 
too, 
fear 
is 
again 
the 
mother 
of 
morals. 


The 
highest 
and 
strongest 
drives, 
when 
they 
break 
out 
passionately 
and 
drive 
the 
individual 
far 
above 
the 
average 
and 
the 
flats 
of 
the 
herd 
conscience, 
wreck 
the 
self-confidence 
of 
the 
community, 
its 
faith 
in 
itself, 
and 
it 
is 
as 
if 
its 
spine 
snapped. 
Hence 
just 
these 
drives 
are 
branded 
and 
slandered 
most. 
High 
and 
independent 
spirituality, 
the 
will 
to 
stand 
alone, 
even 
a 
powerful 
reason 
are 
experienced 
as 
dangers; 
everything 
that 
elevates 
an 
individual 
above 
the 
herd 
and 
intimidates 
the 
neighbor 
is 
henceforth 
called 
evil; 
and 
the 
fair, 
modest, 
submissive, 
conforming 
mentality, 
the 
mediocrity 
of 
desires 
attains 
moral 
designations 
and 
honors. 
Eventually, 
under 
very 
peaceful 
conditions, 
the 
opportunity 
and 
necessity 
for 
educating 
one’s 
feelings 
to 
severity 
and 
hardness 
is 
lacking 
more 
and 
more; 
and 
every 
severity, 
even 
in 
justice, 
begins 
to 
disturb 
the 
conscience; 
any 
high 
and 
hard 
nobility 
and 
self-reliance 
is 
almost 
felt 
to 
be 
an 
insult 
and 
arouses 
mistrust; 
the 
“lamb,” 
even 
more 
the 
“sheep,” 
gains 
in 
respect. 


There 
is 
a 
point 
in 
the 
history 
of 
society 
when 
it 
becomes 
so 
pathologically 
soft 
and 
tender 
that 
among 
other 
things 
it 
sides 
even 
with 
those 
who 
harm 
it, 
criminals, 
and 
does 
this 
quite 
seriously 
and 
honestly. 
Punishing 
somehow 
seems 
unfair 
to 
it, 
and 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
imagining 
“punishment” 
and 
“being 
supposed 
to 
punish” 
hurts 
it, 
arouses 
fear 
in 
it. 
“Is 
it 
not 
enough 
to 
render 
him 
undangerous? 
Why 
still 
punish? 
Punishing 
itself 
is 
terrible.” 
With 
this 
question, 
herd 
morality, 
the 
morality 
of 
timidity, 
draws 
its 
ultimate 
consequence. 
Supposing 
that 
one 
could 
altogether 
abolish 
danger, 
the 
reason 
for 
fear, 
this 
morality 
would 
be 
abolished, 
too, 
eo 
ipso: 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
needed, 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
consider 
itself 
necessary. 


Whoever 
examines 
the 
conscience 
of 
the 
European 
today 
will 
have 
to 
pull 
the 
same 
imperative 
out 
of 
a 
thousand 
moral 
folds 
and 
hideouts—the 
imperative 
of 
herd 
timidity: 
“we 
want 
that 
some 
day 
there 
should 
be 
nothing 
any 
more 
to 
be 
afraid 
of!” 
Some 
day—throughout 
Europe, 
the 
will 
and 
way 
to 
this 
day 
is 
now 
called 
“progress.”17 



202 


Let 
us 
immediately 
say 
once 
more 
what 
we 
have 
already 
said 
a 
hundred 
times, 
for 
today’s 
ears 
resist 
such 
truths—our 
truths. 
We 
know 
well 
enough 
how 
insulting 
it 
sounds 
when 
anybody 
counts 
man, 
unadorned 
and 
without 
metaphor, 
among 
the 
animals; 
but 
it 
will 
be 
charged 
against 
us 
as 
almost 
a 
guilt 
that 
precisely 
for 
the 
men 
of 
“modern 
ideas” 
we 
constantly 
employ 
such 
expressions 
as 
“herd,” 
“herd 
instincts,” 
and 
so 
forth. 
What 
can 
be 
done 
about 
it? 
We 
cannot 
do 
anything 
else; 
for 
here 
exactly 
lies 
our 
novel 
insight. 
We 
have 
found 
that 
in 
all 
major 
moral 
judgments 
Europe 
is 
now 
of 
one 
mind, 
including 
even 
the 
countries 
dominated 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
Europe: 
plainly, 
one 
now 
knows 
in 
Europe 
what 
Socrates 
thought 
he 
did 
not 
know 
and 
what 
that 
famous 
old 
serpent 
once 
promised 
to 
teach—today 
one 
“knows” 
what 
is 
good 
and 
evil.18 
And 
in 
Shaw’s 
Major 
Barbara 
(Act 
III) 
Undershaft 
says: 
“What! 
no 
capacity 
for 
business, 
no 
knowledge 
of 
law, 
no 
sympathy 
with 
art, 
no 
pretension 
to 
philosophy; 
only 
a 
simple 
knowledge 
of 
the 
secret 
that 
has 
puzzled 
all 
the 
philosophers, 
baffled 
all 
the 
lawyers 
… 
: 
the 
secret 
of 
right 
and 
wrong. 
Why, 
man, 
you 
are 
a 
genius, 
a 
master 
of 
masters, 
a 
god! 
At 
twenty-four, 
too!” 


Now 
it 
must 
sound 
harsh 
and 
cannot 
be 
heard 
easily 
when 
we 
keep 
insisting: 
that 
which 
here 
believes 
it 
knows, 
that 
which 
here 
glorifies 
itself 
with 
its 
praises 
and 
reproaches, 
calling 
itself 
good, 
that 
is 
the 
instinct 
of 
the 
herd 
animal, 
man, 
which 
has 
scored 
a 
breakthrough 
and 
attained 
prevalence 
and 
predominance 
over 
other 
instincts—and 
this 
development 
is 
continuing 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
growing 
physiological 
approximation 
and 
assimilation 
of 
which 
it 
is 
the 
symptom. 
Morality 
in 
Europe 
today 
is 
herd 
animal 
morality 
—in 
other 
words, 
as 
we 
understand 
it, 
merely 
one 
type 
of 
human 
morality 
beside 
which, 
before 
which, 
and 
after 
which 
many 
other 
types, 
above 
all 
higher 
moralities, 
are, 
or 
ought 
to 
be, 
possible. 
But 
this 
morality 
resists 
such 
a 
“possibility,” 
such 
an 
“ought” 
with 
all 
its 
power: 
it 
says 
stubbornly 
and 
inexorably, 
“I 
am 
morality 
itself, 
and 
nothing 
besides 
is 
morality.” 
Indeed, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
a 
religion 
which 
indulged 
and 
flattered 
the 
most 
sublime 
herd-animal 
desires, 
we 
have 
reached 
the 
point 
where 
we 
find 
even 
in 



political 
and 
social 
institutions 
an 
ever 
more 
visible 
expression 
of 
this 
morality: 
the 
democratic 
movement 
is 
the 
heir 
of 
the 
Christian 
movement. 


But 
there 
are 
indications 
that 
its 
tempo 
is 
still 
much 
too 
slow 
and 
sleepy 
for 
the 
more 
impatient, 
for 
the 
sick, 
the 
sufferers 
of 
the 
instinct 
mentioned: 
witness 
the 
ever 
madder 
howling 
of 
the 
anarchist 
dogs 
who 
are 
baring 
their 
fangs 
more 
and 
more 
obviously 
and 
roam 
through 
the 
alleys 
of 
European 
culture. 
They 
seem 
opposites 
of 
the 
peacefully 
industrious 
democrats 
and 
ideologists 
of 
revolution, 
and 
even 
more 
so 
of 
the 
doltish 
philosophasters 
and 
brotherhood 
enthusiasts 
who 
call 
themselves 
socialists 
and 
want 
a 
“free 
society”; 
but 
in 
fact 
they 
are 
at 
one 
with 
the 
lot 
in 
their 
thorough 
and 
instinctive 
hostility 
to 
every 
other 
form 
of 
society 
except 
that 
of 
the 
autonomous 
herd 
(even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
repudiating 
the 
very 
concepts 
of 
“master” 
and 
“servant”—ni 
dieu 
ni 
maître19 
runs 
a 
socialist 
formula). 
They 
are 
at 
one 
in 
their 
tough 
resistance 
to 
every 
special 
claim, 
every 
special 
right 
and 
privilege 
(which 
means 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
every 
right: 
for 
once 
all 
are 
equal 
nobody 
needs 
“rights” 
any 
more). 
They 
are 
at 
one 
in 
their 
mistrust 
of 
punitive 
justice 
(as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
violation 
of 
those 
who 
are 
weaker, 
a 
wrong 
against 
the 
necessary 
consequence 
of 
all 
previous 
society). 
But 
they 
are 
also 
at 
one 
in 
the 
religion 
of 
pity, 
in 
feeling 
with 
all 
who 
feel, 
live, 
and 
suffer 
(down 
to 
the 
animal, 
up 
to 
“God”—the 
excess 
of 
a 
“pity 
with 
God” 
belongs 
in 
a 
democratic 
age). 
They 
are 
at 
one, 
the 
lot 
of 
them, 
in 
the 
cry 
and 
the 
impatience 
of 
pity, 
in 
their 
deadly 
hatred 
of 
suffering 
generally, 
in 
their 
almost 
feminine 
inability 
to 
remain 
spectators, 
to 
let 
someone 
suffer. 
They 
are 
at 
one 
in 
their 
involuntary 
plunge 
into 
gloom 
and 
unmanly 
tenderness 
under 
whose 
spell 
Europe 
seems 
threatened 
by 
a 
new 
Buddhism. 
They 
are 
at 
one 
in 
their 
faith 
in 
the 
morality 
of 
shared 
pity, 
as 
if 
that 
were 
morality 
in 
itself, 
being 
the 
height, 
the 
attained 
height 
of 
man, 
the 
sole 
hope 
of 
the 
future, 
the 
consolation 
of 
present 
man, 
the 
great 
absolution 
from 
all 
former 
guilt. 
They 
are 
at 
one, 
the 
lot 
of 
them, 
in 
their 
faith 
in 
the 
community 
as 
the 
savior, 
in 
short, 
in 
the 
herd, 
in 
“themselves”—

We 
have 
a 
different 
faith; 
to 
us 
the 
democratic 
movement 
is 
not 
only 
a 
form 
of 
the 
decay 
of 
political 
organization 
but 
a 
form 
of 
the 
decay, 
namely 
the 
diminution, 
of 
man, 
making 
him 
mediocre 
and 
lowering 
his 
value. 
Where, 
then, 
must 
we 
reach 
with 
our 
hopes? 


Toward 
new 
philosophers; 
there 
is 
no 
choice; 
toward 
spirits 
strong 
and 
original 
enough 
to 
provide 
the 
stimuli 
for 
opposite 
valuations 
and 
to 
revalue 
and 
invert 
“eternal 
values”; 
toward 
forerunners, 
toward 
men 
of 
the 
future 
who 
in 
the 
present 
tie 
the 
knot 
and 
constraint 
that 
forces 
the 
will 
of 
millennia 
upon 
new 
tracks. 
To 
teach 
man 
the 
future 
of 
man 
as 
his 
will, 
as 
dependent 
on 
a 
human 
will, 
and 
to 
prepare 
great 
ventures 
and 
over-all 
attempts 
of 
discipline 
and 
cultivation 
by 
way 
of 
putting 
an 
end 
to 
that 
gruesome 
dominion 
of 
nonsense 
and 
accident 
that 
has 
so 
far 
been 
called 
“history”—the 
nonsense 
of 
the 
“greatest 
number” 
is 
merely 
its 
ultimate 
form: 
at 
some 
time 
new 
types 
of 
philosophers 
and 
commanders 
will 
be 
necessary 
for 
that, 
and 
whatever 
has 
existed 
on 
earth 
of 
concealed, 
terrible, 
and 
benevolent 
spirits, 
will 
look 
pale 
and 
dwarfed 
by 
comparison. 
It 
is 
the 
image 
of 
such 
leaders 
that 
we 
envisage: 
may 
I 
say 
this 
out 
loud, 
you 
free 
spirits? 
The 
conditions 
that 
one 
would 
have 
partly 
to 
create 
and 
partly 
to 
exploit 
for 
their 
genesis; 
the 
probable 
ways 
and 
tests 
that 
would 
enable 
a 
soul 
to 
grow 
to 
such 
a 
height 
and 
force 
that 
it 
would 
feel 
the 
compulsion 
for 
such 
tasks; 
a 
revaluation 
of 
values 
under 
whose 
new 
pressure 
and 
hammer 
a 
conscience 
would 
be 
steeled, 
a 
heart 
turned 
to 
bronze, 
in 
order 
to 
endure 
the 
weight 
of 
such 
responsibility; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
necessity 
of 
such 
leaders, 
the 
frightening 
danger 
that 
they 
might 
fail 
to 
appear 
or 
that 
they 
might 
turn 
out 
badly 
or 
degenerate— 
these 
are 
our 
real 
worries 
and 
gloom—do 
you 
know 
that, 
you 
free 
spirits?— 
these 
are 
the 
heavy 
distant 
thoughts 
and 
storms 
that 
pass 
over 
the 
sky 
of 
our 
life. 


There 
are 
few 
pains 
as 
sore 
as 
once 
having 
seen, 
guessed, 
felt 
how 
an 
extraordinary 
human 
being 
strayed 
from 
his 
path 
and 
degenerated.20 


But 
anyone 
who 
has 
the 
rare 
eye 
for 
the 
over-all 
danger 
that 
“man” 
himself 
degenerates; 
anyone 
who, 
like 
us, 
has 
recognized 
the 
monstrous 
fortuity 
that 



has 
so 
far 
had 
its 
way 
and 
play 
regarding 
the 
future 
of 
man—a 
game 
in 
which 
no 
hand, 
and 
not 
even 
a 
finger, 
of 
God 
took 
part 
as 
a 
player; 
anyone 
who 
fathoms 
the 
calamity 
that 
lies 
concealed 
in 
the 
absurd 
guilelessness 
and 
blind 
confidence 
of 
“modern 
ideas” 
and 
even 
more 
in 
the 
whole 
Christian-
European 
morality—suffers 
from 
an 
anxiety 
that 
is 
past 
all 
comparisons. 
With 
a 
single 
glance 
he 
sees 
what, 
given 
a 
favorable 
accumulation 
and 
increase 
of 
forces 
and 
tasks, 
might 
yet 
be 
made 
of 
man; 
he 
knows 
with 
all 
the 
knowledge 
of 
his 
conscience 
how 
man 
is 
still 
unexhausted 
for 
the 
greatest 
possibilities 
and 
how 
often 
the 
type 
“man” 
has 
already 
confronted 
enigmatic 
decisions 
and 
new 
paths—he 
knows 
still 
better 
from 
his 
most 
painful 
memories 
what 
wretched 
things 
have 
so 
far 
usually 
broken 
a 
being 
of 
the 
highest 
rank 
that 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
becoming, 
so 
that 
it 
broke, 
sank, 
and 
became 
contemptible. 


The 
over-all 
degeneration 
of 
man 
down 
to 
what 
today 
appears 
to 
the 
socialist 
dolts 
and 
flatheads 
as 
their 
“man 
of 
the 
future”— 
as 
their 
ideal—this 
degeneration 
and 
diminution 
of 
man 
into 
the 
perfect 
herd 
animal 
(or, 
as 
they 
say, 
to 
the 
man 
of 
the 
“free 
society”), 
this 
animalization 
of 
man 
into 
the 
dwarf 
animal 
of 
equal 
rights 
and 
claims, 
is 
possible, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
it. 
Anyone 
who 
has 
once 
thought 
through 
this 
possibility 
to 
the 
end 
knows 
one 
kind 
of 
nausea 
that 
other 
men 
don’t 
know—but 
perhaps 
also 
a 
new 
task!—

purports

The 
correct 
title 
of 
Schopenhauer’s 
book 
is 
Die 
beiden 
Grundprobleme 
der 
Ethik 
(the 
two 
fundamental 
problems 
of 
ethics), 
and 
in 
the 
original 
edition 
of 
1841 
the 
quoted 
passage 
is 
found 
on 
p. 
138. 
Nietzsche 
neither 
placed 
the 
title 
in 
quotes 
nor 
italicized 
it, 
and 
his 
slight 
variation 
of 
the 
title 
is 
less 
odd 
than 
the 
fact 
that 
on 
Schopenhauer’s 
own 
title 
page 
of 
1841 
the 
title 
of 
the 
second 
essay, 
which 
Nietzsche 
cites, 
is 
given 
as 
“Ueber 
das 
Fundament

(“On

Foundation 
of 
Morals, 
not 
awarded 
a 
prize 
by 
the 
Danish 
Royal 
Society 
…”). 
Turning 
the 
page, 
one 
finds 
the 
table 
of 
contents, 
in 
which 
the 
title 
of 
the 
second 
essay 
is 
given 
as 
follows: 
“Preisschrift 
über 
die 
Grundlage 
der 
Moral” 
(Prize 
essay 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
morals). 
(The 
heading 
on 
p. 
101 
agrees 
with 
the 
table 
of 
contents, 
not 
with 
Schopenhauer’s 
title 
page.) 
If 
Schopenhauer 
could 
say 
in 
one 
instance 
Fundament 
and 
in 
the 
other 
Grundlage, 
Nietzsche 
might 
as 
well 
say 
Moral 
instead 
of 
Ethik; 
moreover, 
the 
word 
in 
the 
title 
that 
concerned 
Nietzsche 
was 
Moral, 
not 
Ethik. 


The 
editors 
who 
changed 
the 
title 
and 
page 
reference 
given 
by 
Nietzsche 
failed 
to 
insert 
three 
dots 
in 
the 
quotation 
itself, 
to 
indicate 
a 
minor 
omission 
of 
two 
and 
a 
half 
lines 
between 
“agreed” 
and 
the 
Latin 
quotation. 
This 
omission 
does 
not 
change 
the 
sense 
and 
is 
in 
no 
way 
unfair 
to 
Schopenhauer.

Nietzsche 
was 
the 
first 
to 
use 
sublimiren 
in 
its 
specifically 
modern 
sense, 
which 
is 
widely 
associated 
with 
Freud.

“Plato

is 
described: 
“Lion

It 
has 
often 
been 
alleged 
that 
Cesare

Nietzsche’s 



ideal, 
but 
an 
examination 
of 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
references 
to 
him 
shows 
that 
this 
is 
plainly 
false 
(Kaufmann, 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
7, 
section 
III). 
One

The 
association 
of 
Goethe 
and 
Hafiz 
is 
suggested 
by 
Goethe’s 
great 
collection 
of 
poems, 
West-Östlicher 
Divan 
(West-Eastern 
Divan, 
1819), 
in 
which 
he 
identifies 
himself 
with 
the 
Persian 
poet. 
But 
the 
old 
Goethe, 
unlike 
Hafiz, 
was 
certainly 
no 
sot.

The

Circle 
cultivated 
“monumentalistic” 
historiography, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
second 
“Untimely 
Meditation,” 
and 
penned

of

Another

The 
idea 
that 
much 
of 
man’s 
conduct 
and 
culture 
can 
be 
explained 
in 
terms 
of 
fear 
was 
first 
explored 
extensively 
by 
Nietzsche 
in 
The 
Dawn 
(1881).

Nietzsche’s 
critique 
of 
one 
type 
of 
opposition 
to

should 
be 
compared 
with

“When

the 
conceit

what 
is 
good

evil 
for 
man 
… 
whoever 
wanted

At 
the 
risk 
that 
moralizing 
will 
here, 
too, 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
what 
it 
has 
always 
been—namely, 
according 
to 
Balzac, 
an 
intrepid 
montrer 
ses 
plaies2—I 
venture 
to 
speak 
out 
against 
an 
unseemly 
and 
harmful 
shift 
in 
the 
respective 
ranks 
of 
science3 
and 
philosophy, 
which 
is 
now 
threatening 
to 
become 


established, 
quite 
unnoticed 
and 
as 
if 
it 
were 
accompanied 
by 
a 
perfectly 
good 
conscience. 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
only 
experience—experience 
always 
seems 
to 
mean 
bad 
experience?—can 
entitle 
us 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
such 
higher 
questions 
of 
rank, 
lest 
we 
talk 
like 
blind 
men 
about 
colors—against 
science 
the 
way 
women 
and 
artists 
do 
(“Oh, 
this 
dreadful 
science!” 
sigh 
their 
instinct 
and 
embarrassment; 
“it

the 
bottom 
of 
things!”). 


The 
scholar’s4 
declaration 
of 
independence, 
his 
emancipation 
from 
philosophy, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
more 
refined 
effects 
of 
the 
democratic 
order—and 
disorder: 
the 
self-glorification 
and 
self-exaltation 
of 
scholars5 
now 
stand 
in 
full 
bloom, 
in 
their 
finest 
spring, 
everywhere—which 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
imply 
that 
in 
this 
case 
self-praise 
smells 
pleasant.6 
“Freedom 
from 
all 
masters!” 
that 
is 
what 
the 
instinct 
of 
the 
rabble 
wants 
in 
this 
case, 
too; 
and 
after 
science 
has 
most 
happily 
rid 
itself 
of 
theology 
whose 
“handmaid” 
it 
was 
too 
long, 
it 
now 
aims 
with 
an 
excess 
of 
high 
spirits 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
understanding 
to 
lay 
down 
laws 
for 
philosophy 
and 
to 
play 
the 
“master” 
herself—what 
am 
I 
saying? 
the 
philosopher. 


My 
memory—the 
memory 
of 
a 
scientific 
man, 
if 
you’ll 
forgive 
me—is 
bulging 
with 
naïvetés 
of 
overbearing 
that 
I 
have 
heard 
about 
philosophy 
and 
philosophers 
from 
the 
lips 
of 
young 
natural 
scientists 
and 
old 
physicians 
(not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
most 
learned7 
and 
conceited8 
of 
all 
scholars, 
the 
philologists 
and 
schoolmen, 
who 
are 
both 
by 
profession). 
Sometimes 
it 
was 
the 
specialist 
and 
nook 
dweller 
who 
instinctively 
resisted 
any 
kind 
of 
synthetic 
enterprise 
and 
talent; 
sometimes 
the 
industrious 
worker 
who 
had 
got 
a 
whiff 
of 
otium9 
and 
the 
noble 
riches 
in 
the 
psychic 
economy 
of 
the 
philosopher 
which 
had 
made 
him 
feel 
defensive 
and 
small. 
Sometimes 
it 
was 
that 
color 
blindness 
of 



the 
utility 
man 
who 
sees 
nothing 
in 
philosophy 
but 
a 
series 
of 
refuted 
systems 
and 
a 
prodigal 
effort 
that 
“does 
nobody 
any 
good.” 
Sometimes 
the 
fear 
of 
masked 
mysticism 
and 
a 
correction 
of 
the 
limits 
of 
knowledge 
leaped 
forward; 
sometimes 
lack 
of 
respect 
for 
individual 
philosophers 
that 
had 
involuntarily 
generalized 
itself 
into 
lack 
of 
respect 
for 
philosophy. 


Most 
frequently, 
finally, 
I 
found 
among 
young 
scholars 
that 
what 
lay 
behind 
the 
arrogant 
contempt 
for 
philosophy 
was 
the 
bad 
aftereffect 
of—a 
philosopher 
to 
whom 
they 
now 
denied 
allegiance 
on 
the 
whole 
without, 
however, 
having 
broken 
the 
spell 
of 
his 
cutting 
evaluation 
of 
other 
philosophers—with 
the 
result 
of 
an 
over-all 
irritation 
with 
all 
philosophy. 
(Schopenhauer’s 
aftereffect 
on 
our 
most 
modern 
Germany, 
for 
example, 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
of 
this 
kind: 
with 
his 
unintelligent 
wrath 
against 
Hegel10 
he 
has 
succeeded 
in 
wrenching 
the 
whole 
last 
generation 
of 
Germans 
out 
of 
the 
context 
of 
German 
culture—a 
culture 
that 
was, 
considering 
everything, 
an 
elevation 
and 
divinatory 
subtlety 
of 
the 
historical 
sense. 
But 
precisely 
at 
this 
point 
Schopenhauer 
was 
poor, 
unreceptive, 
and 
un-German 
to 
the 
point 
of 
genius.) 


Altogether, 
taking 
a 
large 
view, 
it 
may 
have 
been 
above 
all 
what 
was 
human, 
all 
too 
human, 
in 
short, 
the 
wretchedness 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
philosophy 
itself 
that 
most 
thoroughly 
damaged 
respect 
for 
philosophy 
and 
opened 
the 
gates 
to 
the 
instinct 
of 
the 
rabble. 
Let 
us 
confess 
how 
utterly 
our 
modern 
world 
lacks 
the 
whole 
type11 
of 
a 
Heraclitus, 
Plato, 
Empedocles, 
and 
whatever 
other 
names 
these 
royal 
and 
magnificent 
hermits 
of 
the 
spirit 
had; 
and 
how 
it 
is 
with 
considerable 
justification 
that, 
confronted 
with 
such 
representatives 
of 
philosophy 
as 
are 
today, 
thanks 
to 
fashion, 
as 
much 
on 
top 
as 
they 
are 
really 
at 
the 
bottom—in 
Germany, 
for 
example, 
the 
two 
lions 
of 
Berlin, 
the 
anarchist 
Eugen 
Dühring 
and 
the 
amalgamist 
Eduard 
von 
Hartmann12—a 
solid 
man 
of 
science 
may 
feel 
that 
he 
is 
of 
a 
better 
type 
and 
descent. 
It 
is 
especially 
the 
sight 
of 
those 
hodgepodge 
philosophers 
who 
call 
themselves 
“philosophers 
of 
reality” 
or 
“positivists” 
that 
is 
capable 
of 
injecting 
a 
dangerous 
mistrust 
into 
the 
soul 
of 
an 
ambitious 
young 
scholar: 
these 
are 
at 
best 
scholars 
and 
specialists 
themselves—that 
is 
palpable—they 
are 
all 
losers 
who 
have 
been 
brought 
back 
under 
the 
hegemony 
of 
science, 
after 
having 
desired 
more 
of 
themselves 
at 
some 
time 
without 
having 
had 
the 
right 
to 
this 
“more” 
and 
its 
responsibilities—and 
who 
now 
represent, 
in 
word 
and 
deed, 
honorably, 
resentfully, 
and 
vengefully, 
the 
unbelief 
in 
the 
masterly 
task 
and 
masterfulness 
of 
philosophy. 



Finally: 
how 
could 
it 
really 
be 
otherwise? 
Science 
is 
flourishing 
today 
and 
her 
good 
conscience 
is 
written 
all 
over 
her 
face, 
while 
the 
level 
to 
which 
all 
modern 
philosophy 
has 
gradually 
sunk, 
this 
rest 
of 
philosophy 
today, 
invites 
mistrust 
and 
displeasure, 
if 
not 
mockery 
and 
pity. 
Philosophy 
reduced 
to 
“theory 
of 
knowledge,” 
in 
fact 
no 
more 
than 
a 
timid 
epochism 
and 
doctrine 
of 
abstinence—a 
philosophy 
that 
never 
gets 
beyond 
the 
threshold 
and 
takes 
pains 
to 
deny 
itself 
the 
right 
to 
enter—that 
is 
philosophy 
in 
its 
last 
throes, 
an 
end, 
an 
agony, 
something 
inspiring 
pity. 
How 
could 
such 
a 
philosophy 
—dominate! 



205 


The 
dangers 
for 
a 
philosopher’s 
development 
are 
indeed 
so 
manifold 
today 
that 
one 
may 
doubt 
whether 
this 
fruit 
can 
still 
ripen 
at 
all. 
The 
scope 
and 
the 
tower-building 
of 
the 
sciences 
has 
grown 
to 
be 
enormous, 
and 
with 
this 
also 
the 
probability 
that 
the 
philosopher 
grows 
weary 
while 
still 
learning 
or 
allows 
himself 
to 
be 
detained 
somewhere 
to 
become 
a 
“specialist”—so 
he 
never 
attains 
his 
proper 
level, 
the 
height 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
look, 
for 
looking 
around, 
for 
looking 
down. 
Or 
he 
attains 
it 
too 
late, 
when 
his 
best 
time 
and 
strength 
are 
spent—or 
impaired, 
coarsened, 
degenerated, 
so 
his 
view, 
his 
over-all 
value 
judgment 
does 
not 
mean 
much 
any 
more. 
It 
may 
be 
precisely 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
his 
intellectual 
conscience 
that 
leads 
him 
to 
delay 
somewhere 
along 
the 
way 
and 
to 
be 
late: 
he 
is 
afraid 
of 
the 
seduction 
to 
become 
a 
dilettante, 
a 
millipede, 
an 
insect 
with 
a 
thousand 
antennae; 
he 
knows 
too 
well 
that 
whoever 
has 
lost 
his 
self-respect 
cannot 
command 
or 
lead 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
knowledge—unless 
he 
would 
like 
to 
become 
a 
great 
actor, 
a 
philosophical 
Cagliostro 
and 
pied 
piper, 
in 
short, 
a 
seducer. 
This 
is 
in 
the 
end 
a 
question 
of 
taste, 
even 
if 
it 
were 
not 
a 
question 
of 
conscience. 


Add 
to 
this, 
by 
way 
of 
once 
more 
doubling 
the 
difficulties 
for 
a 
philosopher, 
that 
he 
demands 
of 
himself 
a 
judgment, 
a 
Yes 
or 
No, 
not 
about 
the 
sciences 
but 
about 
life 
and 
the 
value 
of 
life—that 
he 
is 
reluctant 
to 
come 
to 
believe 
that 
he 
has 
a 
right, 
or 
even 
a 
duty, 
to 
such 
a 
judgment, 
and 
must 
seek 
his 
way 
to 
this 
right 
and 
faith 
only 
from 
the 
most 
comprehensive— 
perhaps 
most 
disturbing 
and 
destructive13—experiences, 
and 
frequently 
hesitates, 
doubts, 
and 
lapses 
into 
silence. 


Indeed, 
the 
crowd 
has 
for 
a 
long 
time 
misjudged 
and 
mistaken 
the 
philosopher, 
whether 
for 
a 
scientific 
man 
and 
ideal 
scholar 
or 
for 
a 
religiously 
elevated, 
desensualized,14 
“desecularized” 
enthusiast 
and 
sot 
of 
God.15 


And 
if 
a 
man 
is 
praised 
today 
for 
living 
“wisely” 
or 
“as 
a 
philosopher,” 
it 
hardly 
means 
more 
than 
“prudently 
and 
apart.” 
Wisdom—seems 
to 
the 
rabble 
a 
kind 
of 
escape, 
a 
means 
and 
trick 
for 
getting 
well 
out 
of 
a 
wicked 
game. 
But 
the 
genuine 
philosopher—as 
it 
seems 
to 
us, 
my 
friends?—lives 
“unphilosophically” 
and 
“unwisely,” 
above 
all 
imprudently, 
and 
feels 
the 



burden 
and 
the 
duty 
of 
a 
hundred 
attempts 
and 
temptations 
of 
life—he 
risks 
himself 
constantly, 
he 
plays 
the 
wicked 
game— 



206 


Compared 
to 
a 
genius—that 
is, 
to 
one 
who 
either 
begets 
or 
gives 
birth, 
taking 
both 
terms 
in 
their 
most 
elevated 
sense—the 
scholar, 
the 
scientific 
average 
man, 
always 
rather 
resembles 
an 
old 
maid: 
like 
her 
he 
is 
not 
conversant 
with 
the 
two 
most 
valuable 
functions 
of 
man. 
Indeed, 
one 
even 
concedes 
to 
both, 
to 
the 
scholars 
and 
to 
old 
maids, 
as 
it 
were 
by 
way 
of 
a 
compensation, 
that 
they 
are 
respectable—one 
stresses 
their 
respectability— 
and 
yet 
feels 
annoyed 
all 
over 
at 
having 
to 
make 
this 
concession. 


Let 
us 
look 
more 
closely: 
what 
is 
the 
scientific 
man? 
To 
begin 
with, 
a 
type 
of 
man 
that 
is 
not 
noble, 
with 
the 
virtues 
of 
a 
type 
of 
man 
that 
is 
not 
noble, 
which 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
type 
that 
does 
not 
dominate 
and 
is 
neither 
authoritative 
nor 
self-sufficient: 
he 
has 
industriousness, 
patient 
acceptance 
of 
his 
place 
in 
rank 
and 
file, 
evenness 
and 
moderation 
in 
his 
abilities 
and 
needs, 
an 
instinct 
for 
his 
equals 
and 
for 
what 
they 
need; 
for 
example, 
that 
bit 
of 
independence 
and 
green 
pasture 
without 
which 
there 
is 
no 
quiet 
work, 
that 
claim 
to 
honor 
and 
recognition 
(which 
first 
of 
all 
presupposes 
literal 
recognition 
and 
recognizability), 
that 
sunshine 
of 
a 
good 
name, 
that 
constant 
attestation 
of 
his 
value 
and 
utility 
which 
is 
needed 
to 
overcome 
again 
and 
again 
the 
internal 
mistrust 
which 
is 
the 
sediment 
in 
the 
hearts 
of 
all 
dependent 
men 
and 
herd 
animals. 


The 
scholar 
also 
has, 
as 
is 
only 
fair, 
the 
diseases 
and 
bad 
manners 
of 
a 
type 
that 
is 
not 
noble: 
he 
is 
rich 
in 
petty 
envy 
and 
has 
lynx 
eyes 
for 
what 
is 
base 
in 
natures 
to 
whose 
heights 
he 
cannot 
attain. 
He 
is 
familiar, 
but 
only 
like 
those 
who 
let 
themselves 
go, 
not 
flow; 
and 
just 
before 
those 
who 
flow 
like 
great 
currents 
he 
freezes 
and 
becomes 
doubly 
reserved: 
his 
eye 
becomes 
like 
a 
smooth 
and 
reluctant 
lake 
with 
not 
a 
ripple 
of 
delight 
or 
sympathy. 
The 
worst 
and 
most 
dangerous 
thing 
of 
which 
scholars 
are 
capable 
comes 
from 
their 
sense 
of 
the 
mediocrity 
of 
their 
own 
type—from 
that 
Jesuitism 
of 
mediocrity 
which 
instinctively 
works 
at 
the 
annihilation 
of 
the 
uncommon 
man 
and 
tries 
to 
break 
every 
bent 
bow 
or, 
preferably, 
to 
unbend 
it. 
Unbending— 
considerately, 
of 
course, 
with 
a 
solicitous 
hand—unbending 
with 
familiar 
pity, 
that 
is 
the 
characteristic 
art 
of 
Jesuitism 
which 
has 
always 
known 
how 
to 
introduce 
itself 
as 
a 
religion 
of 
pity.— 



207 


However 
gratefully 
we 
may 
welcome 
an 
objective 
spirit—and 
is 
there 
anyone 
who 
has 
never 
been 
mortally 
sick 
of 
everything 
subjective 
and 
of 
his 
accursed 
ipsissimosity?16 


—in 
the 
end 
we 
also 
have 
to 
learn 
caution 
against 
our 
gratitude 
and 
put 
a 
halt 
to 
the 
exaggerated 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
“unselfing” 
and 
depersonalization 
of 
the 
spirit 
is 
being 
celebrated 
nowadays 
as 
if 
it 
were 
the 
goal 
itself 
and 
redemption 
and 
transfiguration. 
This 
is 
particularly 
characteristic 
of 
the 
pessimist’s 
school, 
which 
also 
has 
good 
reasons 
for 
according 
the 
highest 
honors 
to 
“disinterested 
knowledge.” 


The 
objective 
person 
who 
no 
longer 
curses 
and 
scolds 
like 
the 
pessimist, 
the 
ideal 
scholar 
in 
whom 
the 
scientific 
instinct, 
after 
thousands 
of 
total 
and 
semi-failures, 
for 
once 
blossoms 
and 
blooms 
to 
the 
end, 
is 
certainly 
one 
of 
the 
most 
precious 
instruments 
there 
are; 
but 
he 
belongs 
in 
the 
hand 
of 
one 
more 
powerful. 
He 
is 
only 
an 
instrument; 
let 
us 
say, 
he 
is 
a 
mirror—he 
is 
no 
“end 
in 
himself.” 
The 
objective 
man 
is 
indeed 
a 
mirror: 
he 
is 
accustomed 
to 
submit 
before 
whatever 
wants 
to 
be 
known, 
without 
any 
other 
pleasure 
than 
that 
found 
in 
knowing 
and 
“mirroring”; 
he 
waits 
until 
something 
comes, 
and 
then 
spreads 
himself 
out 
tenderly 
lest 
light 
footsteps 
and 
the 
quick 
passage 
of 
spiritlike 
beings 
should 
be 
lost 
on 
his 
plane 
and 
skin. 


Whatever 
still 
remains 
in 
him 
of 
a 
“person” 
strikes 
him 
as 
accidental, 
often 
arbitrary, 
still 
more 
often 
disturbing: 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
has 
he 
become 
a 
passageway 
and 
reflection 
of 
strange 
forms 
and 
events 
even 
to 
himself. 
He 
recollects 
“himself” 
only 
with 
an 
effort 
and 
often 
mistakenly; 
he 
easily 
confuses 
himself 
with 
others, 
he 
errs 
about 
his 
own 
needs 
and 
is 
in 
this 
respect 
alone 
unsubtle 
and 
slovenly. 
Perhaps 
his 
health 
torments 
him, 
or 
the 
pettiness 
and 
cramped 
atmosphere 
of 
wife 
and 
friend, 
or 
the 
lack 
of 
companions 
and 
company—yes, 
he 
forces 
himself 
to 
reflect 
on 
his 
torments 
—in 
vain. 
Already 
his 
thoughts 
roam—to 
a 
more 
general 
case, 
and 
tomorrow 
he 
knows 
no 
more 
than 
he 
did 
yesterday 
how 
he 
might 
be 
helped. 
He 
has 
lost 
any 
seriousness 
for 
himself, 
also 
time: 
he 
is 
cheerful, 
not 
for 
lack 
of 
distress, 
but 
for 
lack 
of 
fingers 
and 
handles 
for 
his 
need. 
His 
habit 
of 
meeting 
every 



thing 
and 
experience 
halfway, 
the 
sunny 
and 
impartial 
hospitality 
with 
which 
he 
accepts 
everything 
that 
comes 
his 
way, 
his 
type 
of 
unscrupulous 
benevolence, 
of 
dangerous 
unconcern 
about 
Yes 
and 
No—alas, 
there 
are 
cases 
enough 
in 
which 
he 
has 
to 
pay 
for 
these 
virtues! 
And 
as 
a 
human 
being 
he 
becomes 
all 
too 
easily 
the 
caput 
mortuum17 
of 
these 
virtues. 


If 
love 
and 
hatred 
are 
wanted 
from 
him—I 
mean 
love 
and 
hatred 
as 
God, 
woman, 
and 
animal 
understand 
them—he 
will 
do 
what 
he 
can 
and 
give 
what 
he 
can. 
But 
one 
should 
not 
be 
surprised 
if 
it 
is 
not 
much—if 
just 
here 
he 
proves 
inauthentic, 
fragile, 
questionable, 
and 
worm-eaten. 
His 
love 
is 
forced, 
his 
hatred 
artificial 
and 
rather 
un 
tour 
de 
force, 
a 
little 
vanity 
and 
exaggeration. 
After 
all, 
he 
is 
genuine 
only 
insofar 
as 
he 
may 
be 
objective: 
only 
in 
his 
cheerful 
“totalism” 
he 
is 
still 
“nature” 
and 
“natural.” 
His 
mirror 
soul, 
eternally 
smoothing 
itself 
out, 
no 
longer 
knows 
how 
to 
affirm 
or 
negate; 
he 
does 
not 
command, 
neither 
does 
he 
destroy. 
“Je 
ne 
méprise 
presque 
rien,”18 
he 
says 
with 
Leibniz: 
one 
should 
not 
overlook 
and 
underestimate 
that 


19 


presque. 


Neither 
is 
he 
a 
model 
man; 
he 
does 
not 
go 
before 
anyone, 
nor 
behind; 
altogether 
he 
places 
himself 
too 
far 
apart 
to 
have 
any 
reason 
to 
take 
sides 
for 
good 
or 
evil. 
When 
confusing 
him 
for 
so 
long 
with 
the 
philosopher, 
with 
the 
Caesarian 
cultivator 
and 
cultural 
dynamo,20 
one 
accorded 
him 
far 
too 
high 
honors 
and 
overlooked 
his 
most 
essential 
characteristics: 
he 
is 
an 
instrument, 
something 
of 
a 
slave 
though 
certainly 
the 
most 
sublime 
type 
of 
slave, 
but 
in 
himself 
nothing—presque 
rien! 
The 
objective 
man 
is 
an 
instrument, 
a 
precious, 
easily 
injured 
and 
clouded 
instrument 
for 
measuring 
and, 
as 
an 
arrangement 
of 
mirrors, 
an 
artistic 
triumph 
that 
deserves 
care 
and 
honor; 
but 
he 
is 
no 
goal, 
no 
conclusion 
and 
sunrise,21 
no 
complementary 
man 
in 
whom 
the 
rest 
of 
existence 
is 
justified, 
no 
termination—and 
still 
less 
a 
beginning, 
a 
begetting 
and 
first 
cause, 
nothing 
tough, 
powerful, 
self-reliant 
that 
wants 
to 
be 
master—rather 
only 
a 
delicate, 
carefully 
dusted, 
fine, 
mobile 
pot 
for 
forms 
that 
still 
has 
to 
wait 
for 
some 
content 
and 
substance 
in 
order 
to 
“shape” 
itself 
accordingly—for 
the 
most 
part, 
a 
man 
without 
substance 
and 
content, 
a 
“selfless” 
man. 
Consequently, 
also 
nothing 
for 
women, 
in 
parenthesi.— 



208 


When 
a 
philosopher 
suggests 
these 
days 
that 
he 
is 
not 
a 
skeptic—I 
hope 
this 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
description 
just 
given 
of 
the 
objective 
spirit—everybody 
is 
annoyed. 
One 
begins 
to 
look 
at 
him 
apprehensively, 
one 
would 
like 
to 
ask, 
to 
ask 
so 
much—— 
Indeed, 
among 
timid 
listeners, 
of 
whom 
there 
are 
legions 
now, 
he 
is 
henceforth 
considered 
dangerous. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
at 
his 
rejection 
of 
skepticism 
they 
heard 
some 
evil, 
menacing 
rumbling 
in 
the 
distance, 
as 
if 
a 
new 
explosive 
were 
being 
tried 
somewhere, 
a 
dynamite 
of 
the 
spirit, 
perhaps 
a 
newly 
discovered 
Russian 
nihiline,22 
a 
pessimism 
bonae 
voluntatis23 
that 
does 
not 
merely 
say 
No, 
want 
No, 
but—horrible 
thought!—does 
No. 


Against 
this 
type 
of 
“good 
will”—a 
will 
to 
the 
actual, 
active 
denial 
of 
life 
—there 
is 
today, 
according 
to 
common 
consent, 
no 
better 
soporific 
and 
sedative 
than 
skepticism, 
the 
gentle, 
fair, 
lulling 
poppy 
of 
skepticism; 
and 
even 
Hamlet 
is 
now 
prescribed 
by 
the 
doctors 
of 
the 
day 
against 
the 
“spirit”24 
and 
its 
underground 
rumblings. 
“Aren’t 
our 
ears 
filled 
with 
wicked 
noises 
as 
it 
is?” 
asks 
the 
skeptic 
as 
a 
friend 
of 
quiet, 
and 
almost 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
security 
police; 
“this 
subterranean 
No 
is 
terrible! 
Be 
still 
at 
last, 
you 
pessimistic 
moles!” 


For 
the 
skeptic, 
being 
a 
delicate 
creature, 
is 
frightened 
all 
too 
easily; 
his 
conscience 
is 
trained 
to 
quiver 
at 
every 
No, 
indeed 
even 
at 
a 
Yes 
that 
is 
decisive 
and 
hard, 
and 
to 
feel 
as 
if 
it 
had 
been 
bitten.25 
Yes 
and 
No—that 
goes 
against 
his 
morality; 
conversely, 
he 
likes 
to 
treat 
his 
virtue 
to 
a 
feast 
of 
noble 
abstinence, 
say, 
by 
repeating 
Montaigne’s 
“What 
do 
I 
know?” 
or 
Socrates’ 
“I 
know 
that 
I 
know 
nothing.” 
Or: 
“Here 
I 
don’t 
trust 
myself, 
here 
no 
door 
is 
open 
to 
me.” 
Or: 
“Even 
if 
one 
were 
open, 
why 
enter 
right 
away?” 
Or: 
“What 
use 
are 
all 
rash 
hypotheses? 
Entertaining 
no 
hypotheses 
at 
all 
might 
well 
be 
part 
of 
good 
taste. 
Must 
you 
insist 
on 
immediately 
straightening 
what 
is 
crooked? 
on 
filling 
up 
every 
hole 
with 
oakum? 
Isn’t 
there 
time? 
Doesn’t 
time 
have 
time? 
O 
you 
devilish 
brood, 
are 
you 
incapable 
of 
waiting? 
The 
uncertain 
has 
its 
charms, 
too; 
the 
sphinx, 
too, 
is 
a 
Circe; 
Circe, 
too, 
was 
a 
philosopher.” 


Thus 
a 
skeptic 
consoles 
himself; 
and 
it 
is 
true 
that 
he 
stands 
in 
need 
of 



some 
consolation. 
For 
skepticism 
is 
the 
most 
spiritual 
expression 
of 
a 
certain 
complex 
physiological 
condition 
that 
in 
ordinary 
language 
is 
called 
nervous 
exhaustion 
and 
sickliness; 
it 
always 
develops 
when 
races 
or 
classes 
that 
have 
long 
been 
separated 
are 
crossed 
suddenly 
and 
decisively. 
In 
the 
new 
generation 
that, 
as 
it 
were, 
has 
inherited 
in 
its 
blood 
diverse 
standards 
and 
values, 
everything 
is 
unrest, 
disturbance, 
doubt, 
attempt; 
the 
best 
forces 
have 
an 
inhibiting 
effect, 
the 
very 
virtues 
do 
not 
allow 
each 
other 
to 
grow 
and 
become 
strong; 
balance, 
a 
center 
of 
gravity, 
and 
perpendicular 
poise 
are 
lacking 
in 
body 
and 
soul. 
But 
what 
becomes 
sickest 
and 
degenerates 
most 
in 
such 
hybrids 
is 
the 
will: 
they 
no 
longer 
know 
independence 
of 
decisions 
and 
the 
intrepid 
sense 
of 
pleasure 
in 
willing—they 
doubt 
the 
“freedom 
of 
the 
will” 
even 
in 
their 
dreams. 


Our 
Europe 
of 
today, 
being 
the 
arena 
of 
an 
absurdly 
sudden 
attempt 
at 
a 
radical 
mixture 
of 
classes, 
and 
hence 
races, 
is 
therefore 
skeptical 
in 
all 
its 
heights 
and 
depths—sometimes 
with 
that 
mobile 
skepticism 
which 
leaps 
impatiently 
and 
lasciviously 
from 
branch 
to 
branch, 
sometimes 
dismal 
like 
a 
cloud 
overcharged 
with 
question 
marks—and 
often 
mortally 
sick 
of 
its 
will. 
Paralysis 
of 
the 
will: 
where 
today 
does 
one 
not 
find 
this 
cripple 
sitting? 
And 
often 
in 
such 
finery! 
How 
seductive 
the 
finery 
looks! 
This 
disease 
enjoys 
the 
most 
beautiful 
pomp-and 
lie-costumes; 
and 
most 
of 
what 
today 
displays 
itself 
in 
the 
showcases, 
for 
example, 
as 
“objectivity,” 
“being 
scientific,” 
“l’art 
pour 
l’art,” 
“pure 
knowledge, 
free 
of 
will,” 
is 
merely 
dressed-up 
skepticism 
and 
paralysis 
of 
the 
will: 
for 
this 
diagnosis 
of 
the 
European 
sickness 
I 
vouch. 


The 
sickness 
of 
the 
will 
is 
spread 
unevenly 
over 
Europe: 
it 
appears 
strongest 
and 
most 
manifold 
where 
culture 
has 
been 
at 
home 
longest; 
it 
disappears 
to 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
“barbarian” 
still—or 
again—claims 
his 
rights 
under 
the 
loose 
garments 
of 
Western 
culture. 
In 
France 
today 
the 
will 
is 
accordingly 
most 
seriously 
sick, 
which 
is 
as 
easy 
to 
infer 
as 
it 
is 
palpable. 
And 
France, 
having 
always 
possessed 
a 
masterly 
skill 
at 
converting 
even 
the 
most 
calamitous 
turns 
of 
its 
spirit 
into 
something 
attractive 
and 
seductive, 
now 
really 
shows 
its 
cultural 
superiority 
over 
Europe 
by 
being 
the 
school 
and 
display 
of 
all 
the 
charms 
of 
skepticism. 


The 
strength 
to 
will, 
and 
to 
will 
something 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
is 
a 
little 
greater 
in 
Germany, 
and 
more 
so 
in 
the 
German 
north 
than 
in 
the 
center 
of 
Germany; 
but 
much 
stronger 
yet 
in 
England, 
Spain, 
and 
Corsica, 
here 
in 
association 
with 
indolence, 
there 
with 
hard 
heads—not 
to 
speak 
of 
Italy, 
which 
is 
too 



young 
to 
know 
what 
it 
wants 
and 
still 
has 
to 
prove 
whether 
it 
is 
able 
to 
will— 
but 
it 
is 
strongest 
and 
most 
amazing 
by 
far 
in 
that 
enormous 
empire 
in 
between, 
where 
Europe, 
as 
it 
were, 
flows 
back 
into 
Asia, 
in 
Russia. 
There 
the 
strength 
to 
will 
has 
long 
been 
accumulated 
and 
stored 
up, 
there 
the 
will— 
uncertain 
whether 
as 
a 
will 
to 
negate 
or 
a 
will 
to 
affirm—is 
waiting 
menacingly 
to 
be 
discharged, 
to 
borrow 
a 
pet 
phrase 
of 
our 
physicists 
today. 
It 
may 
well 
take 
more 
than 
Indian 
wars 
and 
complications 
in 
Asia 
to 
rid 
Europe 
of 
its 
greatest 
danger: 
internal 
upheavals 
would 
be 
needed, 
too, 
the 
shattering 
of 
the 
empire 
into 
small 
units, 
and 
above 
all 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
parliamentary 
nonsense, 
including 
the 
obligation 
for 
everybody 
to 
read 
his 
newspaper 
with 
his 
breakfast. 


I 
do 
not 
say 
this 
because 
I 
want 
it 
to 
happen: 
the 
opposite 
would 
be 
rather 
more 
after 
my 
heart—I 
mean 
such 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
menace 
of 
Russia 
that 
Europe 
would 
have 
to 
resolve 
to 
become 
menacing, 
too, 
namely, 
to 
acquire 
one 
will 
by 
means 
of 
a 
new 
caste 
that 
would 
rule 
Europe, 
a 
long, 
terrible 
will 
of 
its 
own 
that 
would 
be 
able 
to 
cast 
its 
goals 
millennia 
hence—so 
the 
long-
drawn-out 
comedy 
of 
its 
many 
splinter 
states 
as 
well 
as 
its 
dynastic 
and 
democratic 
splinter 
wills 
would 
come 
to 
an 
end. 
The 
time 
for 
petty 
politics 
is 
over: 
the 
very 
next 
century 
will 
bring 
the 
fight 
for 
the 
dominion 
of 
the 
earth 
—the 
compulsion 
to 
large-scale 
politics. 



209 


To 
what 
extent 
the 
new 
warlike 
age 
into 
which 
we 
Europeans 
have 
evidently 
entered 
may 
also 
favor 
the 
development 
of 
another 
and 
stronger 
type 
of 
skepticism, 
on 
that 
I 
want 
to 
comment 
for 
the 
present 
only 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
parable 
which 
those 
who 
like 
German 
history 
should 
understand 
readily. 
That 
unscrupulous 
enthusiast 
for 
handsome 
and 
very 
tall 
grenadiers 
who, 
as 
King 
of 
Prussia,26 
brought 
into 
being 
a 
military 
and 
skeptical 
genius—and 
thus, 
when 
you 
come 
right 
down 
to 
it, 
that 
new 
type 
of 
German 
which 
has 
just 
now 
come 
to 
the 
top 
triumphantly—the 
questionable, 
mad 
father 
of 
Frederick 
the 
Great 
himself 
had 
the 
knack 
and 
lucky 
claw 
of 
genius, 
though 
only 
at 
one 
point: 
he 
knew 
what 
was 
missing 
in 
Germany 
at 
that 
time, 
and 
what 
lack 
was 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
critical 
and 
urgent 
than, 
say, 
the 
lack 
of 
education 
and 
social 
graces—his 
antipathy 
against 
the 
young 
Frederick 
came 
from 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
deep 
instinct. 
Men 
were 
missing; 
and 
he 
suspected 
with 
the 
most 
bitter 
dismay 
that 
his 
own 
son 
was 
not 
man 
enough. 
In 
this 
he 
was 
deceived: 
but 
who, 
in 
his 
place, 
wouldn’t 
have 
deceived 
himself 
about 
that? 
He 
saw 
his 
son 
surrender 
to 
atheism, 
to 
esprit, 
to 
the 
hedonistic 
frivolity 
of 
clever 
Frenchmen: 
in 
the 
background 
he 
saw 
that 
great 
vampire, 
the 
spider 
of 
skepticism; 
he 
suspected 
the 
incurable 
misery 
of 
a 
heart 
that 
is 
no 
longer 
hard 
enough 
for 
evil 
or 
good, 
of 
a 
broken 
will 
that 
no 
longer 
commands, 
no 
longer 
is 
capable 
of 
commanding. 
Meanwhile 
there 
grew 
up 
in 
his 
son 
that 
more 
dangerous 
and 
harder 
new 
type 
of 
skepticism—who 
knows 
how 
much 
it 
owed 
precisely 
to 
the 
hatred 
of 
the 
father 
and 
the 
icy 
melancholy 
of 
a 
will 
condemned 
to 
solitude?—the 
skepticism 
of 
audacious 
manliness 
which 
is 
most 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
genius 
for 
war 
and 
conquest 
and 
first 
entered 
Germany 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
great 
Frederick. 


This 
skepticism 
despises 
and 
nevertheless 
seizes; 
it 
undermines 
and 
takes 
possession; 
it 
does 
not 
believe 
but 
does 
not 
lose 
itself 
in 
the 
process; 
it 
gives 
the 
spirit 
dangerous 
freedom, 
but 
it 
is 
severe 
on 
the 
heart; 
it 
is 
the 
German 
form 
of 
skepticism 
which, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
continued 
Frederickianism 
that 
had 
been 
sublimated 
spiritually, 
brought 
Europe 
for 
a 
long 
time 
under 
the 
hegemony 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
and 
its 
critical 
and 
historical 
mistrust. 
Thanks 



to 
the 
unconquerably 
strong 
and 
tough 
virility 
of 
the 
great 
German 
philologists 
and 
critical 
historians 
(viewed 
properly, 
all 
of 
them 
were 
also 
artists 
of 
destruction 
and 
dissolution), 
a 
new 
concept 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
crystallized 
gradually 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
romanticism 
in 
music 
and 
philosophy, 
and 
the 
inclination 
to 
virile 
skepticism 
became 
a 
decisive 
trait, 
now, 
for 
example, 
as 
an 
intrepid 
eye, 
now 
as 
the 
courage 
and 
hardness 
of 
analysis, 
as 
the 
tough 
will 
to 
undertake 
dangerous 
journeys 
of 
exploration 
and 
spiritualized 
North 
Pole 
expeditions 
under 
desolate 
and 
dangerous 
skies.27 
There 
may 
be 
good 
reasons 
why 
warmblooded 
and 
superficial 
humanitarians 
cross 
themselves 
just 
when 
they 
behold 
this 
spirit—cet 
esprit 
fataliste, 
ironique, 
méphistophélique,28 
Michelet 
calls 
it, 
not 
without 
a 
shudder. 
But 
if 
we 
want 
to 
really 
feel 
what 
a 
distinction 
such 
fear 
of 
the 
“man” 
in 
the 
German 
spirit 
confers—a 
spirit 
through 
which 
Europe 
was 
after 
all 
awakened 
from 
her 
“dogmatic 
slumber”29—we 
have 
to 
remember 
the 
former 
conception 
which 
was 
replaced 
by 
this 
one: 
it 
was 
not 
so 
long 
ago 
that 
a 
masculinized 
woman 
could 
dare 
with 
unbridled 
presumption 
to 
commend 
the 
Germans 
to 
the 
sympathy 
of 
Europe 
as 
being 
gentle, 
goodhearted, 
weak-
willed, 
and 
poetic 
dolts.30 
At 
long 
last 
we 
ought 
to 
understand 
deeply 
enough 
Napoleon’s 
surprise 
when 
he 
came 
to 
see 
Goethe: 
it 
shows 
what 
people 
had 
associated 
with 
the 
“German 
spirit” 
for 
centuries. 
“Voilà 
un 
homme!”—that 
meant: 
“But 
this 
is 
a 
man! 
And 
I 
had 
merely 
expected 
a 
German.”31—

Suppose 
then 
that 
some 
trait 
in 
the 
image 
of 
the 
philosophers 
of 
the 
future 
poses 
the 
riddle 
whether 
they 
would 
not 
perhaps 
have 
to 
be 
skeptics 
in 
the 
sense 
suggested 
last, 
this 
would 
still 
designate 
only 
one 
feature 
and 
not 
them 
as 
a 
whole. 
With 
just 
as 
much 
right 
one 
could 
call 
them 
critics: 
and 
certainly 
they 
will 
be 
men 
of 
experiments.32 
With 
the 
name 
in 
which 
I 
dared 
to 
baptize 
them 
I 
have 
already 
stressed 
expressly 
their 
attempts 
and 
delight 
in 
attempts: 
was 
this 
done 
because 
as 
critics 
in 
body 
and 
soul 
they 
like 
to 
employ 
experiments 
in 
a 
new, 
perhaps 
wider, 
perhaps 
more 
dangerous 
sense? 
Does 
their 
passion 
for 
knowledge 
force 
them 
to 
go 
further 
with 
audacious 
and 
painful 
experiments 
than 
the 
softhearted 
and 
effeminate 
taste 
of 
a 
democratic 
century 
could 
approve? 


No 
doubt, 
these 
coming 
philosophers 
will 
be 
least 
able 
to 
dispense 
with 
those 
serious 
and 
by 
no 
means 
unproblematic 
qualities 
which 
distinguish 
the 
critic 
from 
the 
skeptic; 
I 
mean 
the 
certainty 
of 
value 
standards, 
the 
deliberate 
employment 
of 
a 
unity 
of 
method, 
a 
shrewd 
courage, 
the 
ability 
to 
stand 
alone 
and 
give 
an 
account 
of 
themselves. 
Indeed, 
they 
admit 
to 
a 
pleasure 
in 
saying 
No 
and 
in 
taking 
things 
apart, 
and 
to 
a 
certain 
levelheaded 
cruelty 
that 
knows 
how 
to 
handle 
a 
knife 
surely 
and 
subtly, 
even 
when 
the 
heart 
bleeds. 
They 
will 
be 
harder 
(and 
perhaps 
not 
always 
only 
against 
themselves) 
than 
humane 
people 
might 
wish; 
they 
will 
not 
dally 
with 
“Truth” 
to 
be 
“pleased” 
or 
“elevated” 
or 
“inspired” 
by 
her. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
they 
will 
have 
little 
faith 
that 
truth 
of 
all 
things 
should 
be 
accompanied 
by 
such 
amusements 
for 
our 
feelings. 


They 
will 
smile, 
these 
severe 
spirits, 
if 
somebody 
should 
say 
in 
front 
of 
them: 
“This 
thought 
elevates 
me; 
how 
could 
it 
fail 
to 
be 
true?” 
Or: 
“This 
work 
delights 
me; 
how 
could 
it 
fail 
to 
be 
beautiful?” 
Or: 
“This 
artist 
makes 
me 
greater; 
how 
could 
he 
fail 
to 
be 
great?” 
Perhaps 
they 
do 
not 
merely 
have 
a 
smile 
but 
feel 
a 
genuine 
nausea 
over 
everything 
that 
is 
enthusiastic, 
idealistic, 
feminine, 
hermaphroditic 
in 
this 
vein. 
And 
whoever 
knew 
how 
to 
follow 
them 
into 
the 
most 
secret 
chambers 
of 
their 
hearts 
would 
scarcely 
find 
any 
intention 
there 
to 
reconcile 
“Christian 
feelings” 
with 
“classical 
taste” 
and 



possibly 
even 
with 
“modern 
parliamentarism” 
(though 
such 
conciliatory 
attempts 
are 
said 
to 
occur 
even 
among 
philosophers 
in 
our 
very 
unsure 
and 
consequently 
very 
conciliatory 
century). 


Critical 
discipline 
and 
every 
habit 
that 
is 
conducive 
to 
cleanliness 
and 
severity 
in 
matters 
of 
the 
spirit 
will 
be 
demanded 
by 
these 
philosophers 
not 
only 
of 
themselves: 
they 
could 
display 
them 
as 
their 
kind 
of 
jewels— 
nevertheless 
they 
still 
do 
not 
want 
to 
be 
called 
critics 
on 
that 
account. 
They 
consider 
it 
no 
small 
disgrace 
for 
philosophy 
when 
people 
decree, 
as 
is 
popular 
nowadays: 
“Philosophy 
itself 
is 
criticism 
and 
critical 
science—and 
nothing 
whatever 
besides.” 
This 
evaluation 
of 
philosophy 
may 
elicit 
applause 
from 
all 
the 
positivists 
of 
France 
and 
Germany 
(and 
it 
might 
even 
have 
pleased 
the 
heart 
and 
taste 
of 
Kant—one 
should 
remember 
the 
titles 
of 
his 
major 
works); 
our 
new 
philosophers 
will 
say 
nevertheless: 
critics 
are 
instruments 
of 
the 
philosopher 
and 
for 
that 
very 
reason, 
being 
instruments, 
a 
long 
ways 
from 
being 
philosophers 
themselves. 
Even 
the 
great 
Chinese 
of 
Königsberg33 
was 
merely 
a 
great 
critic.— 



211 


I 
insist 
that 
people 
should 
finally 
stop 
confounding 
philosophical 
laborers, 
and 
scientific 
men 
generally, 
with 
philosophers; 
precisely 
at 
this 
point 
we 
should 
be 
strict 
about 
giving 
“each 
his 
due,” 
and 
not 
far 
too 
much 
to 
those 
and 
far 
too 
little 
to 
these. 


It 
may 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
education 
of 
a 
genuine 
philosopher 
that 
he 
himself 
has 
also 
once 
stood 
on 
all 
these 
steps 
on 
which 
his 
servants, 
the 
scientific 
laborers 
of 
philosophy, 
remain 
standing—have 
to 
remain 
standing. 
Perhaps 
he 
himself 
must 
have 
been 
critic 
and 
skeptic 
and 
dogmatist 
and 
historian 
and 
also 
poet 
and 
collector 
and 
traveler 
and 
solver 
of 
riddles 
and 
moralist 
and 
seer 
and 
“free 
spirit” 
and 
almost 
everything 
in 
order 
to 
pass 
through 
the 
whole 
range 
of 
human 
values 
and 
value 
feelings 
and 
to 
be 
able 
to 
see 
with 
many 
different 
eyes 
and 
consciences, 
from 
a 
height 
and 
into 
every 
distance, 
from 
the 
depths 
into 
every 
height, 
from 
a 
nook 
into 
every 
expanse. 
But 
all 
these 
are 
merely 
preconditions 
of 
his 
task: 
this 
task 
itself 
demands 
something 
different—it 
demands 
that 
he 
create 
values. 


Those 
philosophical 
laborers 
after 
the 
noble 
model 
of 
Kant 
and 
Hegel 
have 
to 
determine 
and 
press 
into 
formulas, 
whether 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
logic 
or 
political 
(moral) 
thought 
or 
art, 
some 
great 
data 
of 
valuations—that 
is, 
former 
positings 
of 
values, 
creations 
of 
value 
which 
have 
become 
dominant 
and 
are 
for 
a 
time 
called 
“truths.” 
It 
is 
for 
these 
investigators 
to 
make 
everything 
that 
has 
happened 
and 
been 
esteemed 
so 
far 
easy 
to 
look 
over, 
easy 
to 
think 
over, 
intelligible 
and 
manageable, 
to 
abbreviate 
everything 
long, 
even 
“time,” 
and 
to 
overcome 
the 
entire 
past—an 
enormous 
and 
wonderful 
task 
in 
whose 
service 
every 
subtle 
pride, 
every 
tough 
will 
can 
certainly 
find 
satisfaction. 
Genuine 
philosophers, 
however, 
are 
commanders 
and 
legislators: 
they 
say, 
“thus 
it 
shall 
be!” 
They 
first 
determine 
the 
Whither 
and 
For 
What 
of 
man, 
and 
in 
so 
doing 
have 
at 
their 
disposal 
the 
preliminary 
labor 
of 
all 
philosophical 
laborers, 
all 
who 
have 
overcome 
the 
past. 
With 
a 
creative 
hand 
they 
reach 
for 
the 
future, 
and 
all 
that 
is 
and 
has 
been 
becomes 
a 
means 
for 
them, 
an 
instrument, 
a 
hammer. 
Their 
“knowing” 
is 
creating, 
their 
creating 
is 
a 
legislation, 
their 
will 
to 
truth 
is—will 
to 
power. 


Are 
there 
such 
philosophers 
today? 
Have 
there 
been 
such 
philosophers 



yet? 
Must 
there 
not 
be 
such 
philosophers?34— 



212 


More 
and 
more 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
philosopher, 
being 
of 
necessity 
a 
man 
of 
tomorrow 
and 
the 
day 
after 
tomorrow, 
has 
always 
found 
himself, 
and 
had 
to 
find 
himself, 
in 
contradiction 
to 
his 
today: 
his 
enemy 
was 
ever 
the 
ideal 
of 
today. 
So 
far 
all 
these 
extraordinary 
furtherers 
of 
man 
whom 
one 
calls 
philosophers, 
though 
they 
themselves 
have 
rarely 
felt 
like 
friends 
of 
wisdom 
but 
rather 
like 
disagreeable 
fools 
and 
dangerous 
question 
marks, 
have 
found 
their 
task, 
their 
hard, 
unwanted, 
inescapable 
task, 
but 
eventually 
also 
the 
greatness 
of 
their 
task, 
in 
being 
the 
bad 
conscience 
of 
their 
time. 


By 
applying 
the 
knife 
vivisectionally 
to 
the 
chest 
of 
the 
very 
virtues 
of 
their 
time, 
they 
betrayed 
what 
was 
their 
own 
secret: 
to 
know 
of 
a 
new 
greatness 
of 
man, 
of 
a 
new 
untrodden 
way 
to 
his 
enhancement. 
Every 
time 
they 
exposed 
how 
much 
hypocrisy, 
comfortableness, 
letting 
oneself 
go 
and 
letting 
oneself 
drop, 
how 
many 
lies 
lay 
hidden 
under 
the 
best 
honored 
type 
of 
their 
contemporary 
morality, 
how 
much 
virtue 
was 
outlived. 
Every 
time 
they 
said: 
“We 
must 
get 
there, 
that 
way, 
where 
you 
today 
are 
least 
at 
home.” 


Facing 
a 
world 
of 
“modern 
ideas” 
that 
would 
banish 
everybody 
into 
a 
corner 
and 
“specialty,” 
a 
philosopher—if 
today 
there 
could 
be 
philosophers 
—would 
be 
compelled 
to 
find 
the 
greatness 
of 
man, 
the 
concept 
of 
“greatness,” 
precisely 
in 
his 
range 
and 
multiplicity, 
in 
his 
wholeness 
in 
manifoldness. 
He 
would 
even 
determine 
value 
and 
rank 
in 
accordance 
with 
how 
much 
and 
how 
many 
things 
one 
could 
bear 
and 
take 
upon 
himself, 
how 
far 
one 
could 
extend 
his 
responsibility. 


Today 
the 
taste 
of 
the 
time 
and 
the 
virtue 
of 
the 
time 
weakens 
and 
thins 
down 
the 
will; 
nothing 
is 
as 
timely 
as 
weakness 
of 
the 
will. 
In 
the 
philosopher’s 
ideal, 
therefore, 
precisely 
strength 
of 
the 
will, 
hardness, 
and 
the 
capacity 
for 
long-range 
decisions 
must 
belong 
to 
the 
concept 
of 
“greatness”—with 
as 
much 
justification 
as 
the 
opposite 
doctrine 
and 
the 
ideal 
of 
a 
dumb, 
renunciatory, 
humble, 
selfless 
humanity 
was 
suitable 
for 
an 
opposite 
age, 
one 
that 
suffered, 
like 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
from 
its 
accumulated 
energy 
of 
will 
and 
from 
the 
most 
savage 
floods 
and 
tidal 
waves 
of 
selfishness. 


In 
the 
age 
of 
Socrates, 
among 
men 
of 
fatigued 
instincts, 
among 
the 



conservatives 
of 
ancient 
Athens 
who 
let 
themselves 
go—“toward 
happiness,” 
as 
they 
said; 
toward 
pleasure, 
as 
they 
acted—and 
who 
all 
the 
while 
still 
mouthed 
the 
ancient 
pompous 
words 
to 
which 
their 
lives 
no 
longer 
gave 
them 
any 
right, 
irony 
may 
have 
been 
required 
for 
greatness 
of 
soul,35 
that 
Socratic 
sarcastic 
assurance 
of 
the 
old 
physician 
and 
plebeian 
who 
cut 
ruthlessly 
into 
his 
own 
flesh, 
as 
he 
did 
into 
the 
flesh 
and 
heart 
of 
the 
“noble,” 
with 
a 
look 
that 
said 
clearly 
enough: 
“Don’t 
dissemble 
in 
front 
of 
me! 
Here—we 
are 
equal.” 


Today, 
conversely, 
when 
only 
the 
herd 
animal 
receives 
and 
dispenses 
honors 
in 
Europe, 
when 
“equality 
of 
rights” 
could 
all 
too 
easily 
be 
changed 
into 
equality 
in 
violating 
rights—I 
mean, 
into 
a 
common 
war 
on 
all 
that 
is 
rare, 
strange, 
privileged, 
the 
higher 
man, 
the 
higher 
soul, 
the 
higher 
duty, 
the 
higher 
responsibility, 
and 
the 
abundance 
of 
creative 
power 
and 
masterfulness 
—today 
the 
concept 
of 
greatness 
entails 
being 
noble, 
wanting 
to 
be 
by 
oneself, 
being 
able 
to 
be 
different, 
standing 
alone 
and 
having 
to 
live 
independently. 
And 
the 
philosopher 
will 
betray 
something 
of 
his 
own 
ideal 
when 
he 
posits: 
“He 
shall 
be 
greatest 
who 
can 
be 
loneliest, 
the 
most 
concealed, 
the 
most 
deviant, 
the 
human 
being 
beyond 
good 
and 
evil, 
the 
master 
of 
his 
virtues, 
he 
that 
is 
overrich 
in 
will. 
Precisely 
this 
shall 
be 
called 
greatness: 
being 
capable 
of 
being 
as 
manifold 
as 
whole, 
as 
ample 
as 
full.” 
And 
to 
ask 
it 
once 
more: 
today—is 
greatness 
possible? 



213 


What 
a 
philosopher 
is, 
that 
is 
hard 
to 
learn 
because 
it 
cannot 
be 
taught: 
one 
must 
“know” 
it, 
from 
experience—or 
one 
should 
have 
the 
pride 
not 
to 
know 
it. 
But 
nowadays 
all 
the 
world 
talks 
of 
things 
of 
which 
it 
cannot 
have 
any 
experience, 
and 
this 
is 
most 
true, 
and 
in 
the 
worst 
way, 
concerning 
philosophers 
and 
philosophical 
states: 
exceedingly 
few 
know 
them, 
may 
know 
them, 
and 
all 
popular 
opinions 
about 
them 
are 
false. 


That 
genuinely 
philosophical 
combination, 
for 
example, 
of 
a 
bold 
and 
exuberant 
spirituality 
that 
runs 
presto 
and 
a 
dialectical 
severity 
and 
necessity 
that 
takes 
no 
false 
step 
is 
unknown 
to 
most 
thinkers 
and 
scholars 
from 
their 
own 
experience, 
and 
therefore 
would 
seem 
incredible 
to 
them 
if 
somebody 
should 
speak 
of 
it 
in 
their 
presence. 
They 
picture 
every 
necessity 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
need, 
as 
a 
painstaking 
having-to-follow 
and 
being-compelled. 
And 
thinking 
itself 
they 
consider 
something 
slow 
and 
hesitant, 
almost 
as 
toil, 
and 
often 
enough 
as 
“worthy 
of 
the 
sweat 
of 
the 
noble”—but 
not 
in 
the 
least 
as 
something 
light, 
divine, 
closely 
related 
to 
dancing 
and 
high 
spirits. 
“Thinking” 
and 
taking 
a 
matter 
“seriously,” 
considering 
it 
“grave”—for 
them 
all 
this 
belongs 
together: 
that 
is 
the 
only 
way 
they 
have 
“experienced” 
it. 


Artists 
seem 
to 
have 
more 
sensitive 
noses 
in 
these 
matters, 
knowing 
only 
too 
well 
that 
precisely 
when 
they 
no 
longer 
do 
anything 
“voluntarily” 
but 
do 
everything 
of 
necessity, 
their 
feeling 
of 
freedom, 
subtlety, 
full 
power, 
of 
creative 
placing, 
disposing, 
and 
forming 
reaches 
its 
peak—in 
short, 
that 
necessity 
and 
“freedom 
of 
the 
will” 
then 
become 
one 
in 
them. 


Ultimately, 
there 
is 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
among 
states 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
of 
problems 
accords 
with 
this. 
The 
highest 
problems 
repulse 
everyone 
mercilessly 
who 
dares 
approach 
them 
without 
being 
predestined 
for 
their 
solution 
by 
the 
height 
and 
power 
of 
his 
spirituality. 
What 
does 
it 
avail 
when 
nimble 
smarties 
or 
clumsy 
solid 
mechanics 
and 
empiricists 
push 
near 
them, 
as 
is 
common 
today, 
trying 
with 
their 
plebeian 
ambition 
to 
enter 
the 
“court 
of 
courts.” 
Upon 
such 
carpets 
coarse 
feet 
may 
never 
step: 
the 
primeval 
law 
of 
things 
takes 
care 
of 
that; 
the 
doors 
remain 
closed 
to 
such 
obtrusiveness, 
even 
if 
they 
crash 
and 
crush 
their 
heads 
against 
them. 


For 
every 
high 
world 
one 
must 
be 
born; 
or 
to 
speak 
more 
clearly, 
one 
must 



be 
cultivated 
for 
it: 
a 
right 
to 
philosophy—taking 
that 
word 
in 
its 
great 
sense 
—one 
has 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
one’s 
origins; 
one’s 
ancestors, 
one’s 
“blood”36 
decide 
here, 
too. 
Many 
generations 
must 
have 
labored 
to 
prepare 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
philosopher; 
every 
one 
of 
his 
virtues 
must 
have 
been 
acquired, 
nurtured, 
inherited, 
and 
digested 
singly, 
and 
not 
only 
the 
bold, 
light, 
delicate 
gait 
and 
course 
of 
his 
thoughts 
but 
above 
all 
the 
readiness 
for 
great 
responsibilities, 
the 
loftiness 
of 
glances 
that 
dominate 
and 
look 
down, 
feeling 
separated 
from 
the 
crowd 
and 
its 
duties 
and 
virtues, 
the 
affable 
protection 
and 
defense 
of 
whatever 
is 
misunderstood 
and 
slandered, 
whether 
it 
be 
god 
or 
devil, 
the 
pleasure 
and 
exercise 
of 
the 
great 
justice, 
the 
art 
of 
command, 
the 
width 
of 
the 
will, 
the 
slow 
eye 
that 
rarely 
admires, 
rarely 
looks 
up, 
rarely 
loves37—

The

has, 
instead 
of 
“against 
the 
‘spirit’ 
” 
[gegen 
den 
“Geist”], 
“to 
cure 
mind,” 
which 
misses 
the 
point 
of 
the 
remark 
about 
Hamlet. 


Nietzsche 
had 
argued 
in 
one 
of 
the 
most 
brilliant 
passages 
of 
his 
first 
book, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
that 
Hamlet 
is 
no 
skeptic: 
“Action 
requires 
the 
veils 
of 
illusion: 
that 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Hamlet, 
not 
that 
cheap 
wisdom 
of 
Jack 
the 
Dreamer 
who 
reflects 
too 
much 
… 
Not 
reflection, 
no—true 
knowledge, 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
horrible 
truth, 
outweighs 
any 
motive 
for 
action” 
(section 
7).

In 
German, 
conscience 
bites.

the 
medieval

of

Joyce

It 
is 
essential 
for 
understanding 
Nietzsche 
to 
realize 
that 
he 
is 
not 
“for” 
or 
“against” 
skepticism, 
but 
that 
he 
analyzes 
one 
type 
of 
skepticism 
with 
disdain 
(section 
208) 
before 
describing 
another 
with 
which 
he 
clearly 
identifies 
himself. 
It 
is 
equally 
characteristic 
that 
when 
he 
joins 
his 
countrymen 
in 
admiration 
of 
Frederick 
the 
Great, 
he 
pays 
tribute 
to 
him 
not 
for 
his 
exploits 
and 
conquests 
but 
rather 
for 
his 
skepticism, 
and 
that 
his 
praise 
of 
“tough 
virility” 
is 
aimed 
at 
the 
sublimated, 
spiritual 
version 
found, 
for 
example, 
in 
philologists 
and 
historians. 
For 
Nietzsche’s 
anti-romanticism 
cf.,

The 
Gay 
Science 
(1887),

370,

34 
The 
dichotomy 
proposed 
in 
this 
section 
is 
highly 
questionable: 
we 
find 
both 
analyses 
and 
normative 
suggestions 
in 
the 
works 
of 
the 
major 
moral 
philosophers 
from 
Plato 
and 
Aristotle 
to 
Spinoza 
and 
Kant; 
and 
normative 
thinkers 
or 
legislators 
who 
are 
not 
also 
analysts 
are 
not 
philosophers. 
Yet 
Nietzsche’s 
point 
that 
something 
vital 
is 
lacking 
in 
the 
work 
of 
those 
who 
are 
merely 
“laborers” 
is 
certainly 
worth 
pondering, 
and 
the 
immediately 
following 
section 
offers 
a 
far 
superior 
suggestion 
about 
the 
ethos 
of 
the 
“true” 
philosopher. 


35 
Aristotle’s 
discussion 
of 
greatness 
of 
soul 
(megalopsychia) 
is 
worth 
quoting 
here, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
because 
it 
evidently 
influenced 
Nietzsche. 
The 
valuations 
that 
find 
expression 
in 
Aristotle’s 
account 
are 
exceedingly 
remote 
from 
those 
of 
the 
New 
Testament 
and 
help 
us 
understand 
Nietzsche’s 
contrast 
of 
master 
morality 
and 
slave 
morality, 
introduced 
below 
(section 
260). 
Moreover, 
in 
his 
long 
discussion 
of 
“what 
is 
noble,” 
Nietzsche 
emulates 
Aristotle’s 
descriptive 
mode. 


“A 
person 
is 
thought 
to 
be 
great-souled 
if 
he 
claims 
much 
and 
deserves 
much 
[as 
Socrates 
did 
in 
the 
Apology 
when 
he 
said 
he 
deserved 
the 
greatest 
honor 
Athens 
could 
bestow].… 
He 
that 
claims 
less 
than 
he 
deserves 
is 
small-souled.… 
The 
great-souled 
man 
is 
justified 
in 
despising 
other 
people—his 
estimates 
are 
correct; 
but 
most 
proud 
men 
have 
no 
good 
ground 
for 
their 
pride.… 
He 
is 
fond 
of 
conferring 
benefits, 
but 
ashamed 
to 
receive 
them, 
because 
the 
former 
is 
a 
mark 
of 
superiority 
and 
the 
latter 
of 
inferiority.… 
It 
is 
also 
characteristic 
of 
the 
great-souled 
men 
never 
to 
ask 
help 
from 
others, 
or 
only 
with 
reluctance, 
but 
to 
render 
aid 
willingly; 
and 
to 
be 
haughty 
towards 
men 
of 
position 
and 
fortune, 
but 
courteous 
towards 
those 
of 
moderate 
station.… 
He 
must 
be 
open 



both 
in 
love 
and 
in 
hate, 
since 
concealment 
shows 
timidity; 
and 
care 
more 
for 
the 
truth 
than 
for 
what 
people 
will 
think; 
… 
he 
is 
outspoken 
and 
frank, 
except 
when 
speaking 
with 
ironical 
self-depreciation, 
as 
he 
does 
to 
common 
people.… 
He 
does 
not 
bear 
a 
grudge, 
for 
it 
is 
not 
a 
mark 
of 
greatness 
of 
soul 
to 
recall 
things 
against 
people, 
especially 
the 
wrongs 
they 
have 
done 
you, 
but 
rather 
to 
overlook 
them. 
He 
is 
… 
not 
given 
to 
speaking 
evil 
himself, 
even 
of 
his 
enemies, 
except 
when 
he 
deliberately 
intends 
to 
give 
offence.… 
Such 
then 
being 
the 
great-souled 
man, 
the 
corresponding 
character 
on 
the 
side 
of 
deficiency 
is 
the 
small-
souled 
man, 
and 
on 
that 
of 
excess 
the 
vain 
man” 
(Nicomachean 
Ethics 
IV.3, 
Rackham 
translation 
Cambridge, 
Mass., 
Harvard 
University 
Press, 
1947). 


The 
whole 
passage 
is 
relevant 
and 
extremely 
interesting. 


36 
“Geblüt.” 
Nietzsche’s 
conception 
of 
“blood” 
is 
discussed, 
and 
other 
relevant 
passages 
are 
quoted, 
in 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Chapter 
10. 


37 
The 
element 
of 
snobbery 
and 
the 
infatuation 
with 
“dominating” 
and 
“looking 
down” 
are 
perhaps 
more 
obvious 
than 
Nietzsche’s 
perpetual 
sublimation 
and 
spiritualization 
of 
these 
and 
other 
similar 
qualities. 
It 
may 
be 
interesting 
to 
compare 
Nietzsche’s 
view 
with 
Dr. 
Thomas 
Stockmann’s 
in 
Act 
IV 
of 
Ibsen’s 
An 
Enemy 
of 
the 
People: 


“What 
a 
difference 
there 
is 
between 
a 
cultivated 
and 
an 
uncultivated 
animal 
family! 
Just 
look 
at 
a 
common 
barnyard 
hen.… 
But 
now 
take 
a 
cultivated 
Spanish 
or 
Japanese 
hen, 
or 
take 
a 
noble 
pheasant 
or 
a 
turkey; 
indeed, 
you’ll 
see 
the 
difference. 
And 
then 
I 
refer 
you 
to 
dogs, 
which 
are 
so 
amazingly 
closely 
related 
to 
us 
men. 
Consider 
first 
a 
common 
plebeian 
dog—I 
mean, 
a 
disgusting, 
shaggy, 
moblike 
cur 
that 
merely 
runs 
down 
the 
streets 
and 
fouls 
the 
houses. 
And 
then 
compare 
the 
cur 
with 
a 
poodle 
that 
for 
several 
generations 
is 
descended 
from 
a 
noble 
house 
where 
it 
received 
good 
food 
and 
has 
had 
occasion 
to 
hear 
harmonious 
voices 
and 
music. 
Don’t 
you 
suppose 
that 
the 
poodle’s 
brain 
has 
developed 
in 
a 
way 
quite 
different 
from 
the 
cur’s? 
You 
can 
count 
on 
it. 
It 
is 
such 
cultivated 
young 
poodles 
that 
jugglers 
can 
train 
to 
do 
the 
most 
astonishing 
tricks. 
A 
common 
peasant 
cur 
could 
never 
learn 
anything 
of 
the 
kind, 
even 
if 
stood 
on 
its 
head.” 


Not 
only 
do 
Nietzsche 
and 
Ibsen’s 
Dr. 
Stockmann 
share 
Lamarck’s 
belief 
in 
the 
heredity 
of 
acquired 
characteristics; 
both 
are 
concerned 
with 



spiritual 
nobility 
and 
realize 
that—to 
put 
it 
plainly—of 
two 
brothers 
one 
may 
have 
it 
and 
the 
other 
not. 
Thus 
Stockmann 
says 
a 
little 
later: 
“But 
that’s 
how 
it 
always 
goes 
when 
plebeian 
descent 
is 
still 
in 
one’s 
limbs 
and 
one 
has 
not 
worked 
one’s 
way 
up 
to 
spiritual 
nobility.… 
That 
kind 
of 
rabble 
of 
which 
I 
am 
speaking 
isn’t 
to 
be 
found 
only 
in 
the 
lower 
strata.… 
My 
brother 
Peter—he 
is 
also 
a 
plebeian 
straight 
out 
of 
the 
book.”

arm’s 
length. 
We 
Europeans 
of 
the 
day 
after 
tomorrow, 
we 
first-born 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century 
—with 
all 
our 
dangerous 
curiosity, 
our 
multiplicity 
and 
art 
of 
disguises, 
our 
mellow 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
sweetened 
cruelty 
in 
spirit 
and 
senses—if 
we 
should 
have 
virtues 
we 
shall 
presumably 
have 
only 
virtues 
which 
have 
learned 
to 
get 
along 
best 
with 
our 
most 
secret 
and 
cordial 
inclinations, 
with 
our 
most 
ardent 
needs. 
Well 
then, 
let 
us 
look 
for 
them 
in 
our 
labyrinths—where, 
as 
is 
well 
known, 
all 
sorts 
of 
things 
lose 
themselves, 
all 
sorts 
of 
things 
are 
lost 
for 
good. 
And 
is 
there 
anything 
more 
beautiful 
than 
looking 
for 
one’s 
own 
virtues? 
Doesn’t 
this 
almost 
mean: 
believing 
in 
one’s 
own 
virtue? 
But 
this 
“believing 
in 
one’s 
virtue”—isn’t 
this 
at 
bottom 
the 
same 
thing 
that 
was 
formerly 
called 
one’s 
“good 
conscience,” 
that 
venerable 
long 
pigtail 
of 
a 
concept 
which 
our 
grandfathers 
fastened 
to 
the 
backs 
of 
their 
heads, 
and 
often 
enough 
also 
to 
the 
backside 
of 
their 
understanding? 
So 
it 
seems 
that 
however 
little 
we 
may 
seem 
old-fashioned 
and 
grandfatherly-honorable 
to 
ourselves 
in 
other 
matters, 
in 
one 
respect 
we 
are 
nevertheless 
the 
worthy 
grandsons 
of 
these 
grandfathers, 
we 
last 
Europeans 
with 
a 
good 
conscience: 
we, 
too, 
still 
wear 
their 
pigtail.— 
Alas, 
if 
you 
knew 
how 
soon, 
very 
soon—all 
will 
be 
different!— 



215 


As 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
stars 
the 
orbit 
of 
a 
planet 
is 
in 
some 
cases 
determined 
by 
two 
suns; 
as 
in 
certain 
cases 
suns 
of 
different 
colors 
shine 
near 
a 
single 
planet, 
sometimes 
with 
red 
light, 
sometimes 
with 
green 
light, 
and 
then 
occasionally 
illuminating 
the 
planet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
and 
flooding 
it 
with 
colors—so 
we 
modern 
men 
are 
determined, 
thanks 
to 
the 
complicated 
mechanics 
of 
our 
“starry 
sky,” 
by 
different 
moralities; 
our 
actions 
shine 
alternately 
in 
different 
colors, 
they 
are 
rarely 
univocal—and 
there 
are 
cases 
enough 
in 
which 
we 
perform 
actions 
of 
many 
colors. 



216 


Love 
one’s 
enemies? 
I 
think 
this 
has 
been 
learned 
well: 
it 
is 
done 
thousands 
of 
times 
today, 
in 
small 
ways 
and 
big 
ways. 
Indeed, 
at 
times 
something 
higher 
and 
more 
sublime 
is 
done: 
we 
learn 
to 
despise 
when 
we 
love, 
and 
precisely 
when 
we 
love 
best—but 
all 
of 
this 
unconsciously, 
without 
noise, 
without 
pomp, 
with 
that 
modesty 
and 
concealed 
goodness 
which 
forbids 
the 
mouth 
solemn 
words 
and 
virtue 
formulas. 
Morality 
as 
a 
pose— 
offends 
our 
taste 
today. 
That, 
too, 
is 
progress—just 
as 
it 
was 
progress 
when 
religion 
as 
a 
pose 
finally 
offended 
our 
fathers’ 
taste, 
including 
hostility 
and 
Voltairian 
bitterness 
against 
religion 
(and 
everything 
that 
formerly 
belonged 
to 
the 
gestures 
of 
free-thinkers). 
It 
is 
the 
music 
in 
our 
conscience, 
the 
dance 
in 
our 
spirit, 
with 
which 
the 
sound 
of 
all 
puritan 
litanies, 
all 
moral 
homilies 
and 
old-fashioned 
respectability 
won’t 
go. 



217 


Beware 
of 
those 
who 
attach 
great 
value 
to 
being 
credited 
with 
moral 
tact 
and 
subtlety 
in 
making 
moral 
distinctions. 
They 
never 
forgive 
us 
once 
they 
have 
made 
a 
mistake 
in 
front 
of 
us 
(or, 
worse, 
against 
us): 
inevitably 
they 
become 
our 
instinctive 
slanderers 
and 
detractors, 
even 
if 
they 
should 
still 
remain 
our 
“friends.” 


Blessed 
are 
the 
forgetful: 
for 
they 
get 
over 
their 
stupidities, 
too.

The 
psychologists 
of 
France—and 
where 
else 
are 
any 
psychologists 
left 
today?—still 
have 
not 
exhausted 
their 
bitter 
and 
manifold 
delight 
in 
the 
bêtise 
bourgeoise,1 
just 
as 
if——enough, 
this 
betrays 
something. 
Flaubert, 
for 
example, 
that 
solid 
citizen 
of 
Rouen, 
in 
the 
end 
no 
longer 
saw, 
heard, 
or 
tasted 
anything 
else 
any 
more: 
this 
was 
his 
kind 
of 
self-torture 
and 
subtler 
cruelty. 
Now, 
for 
a 
change—since 
this 
is 
becoming 
boring—I 
propose 
another 
source 
of 
amusement: 
the 
unconscious 
craftiness 
with 
which 
all 
good, 
fat, 
solid, 
mediocre 
spirits 
react 
to 
higher 
spirits 
and 
their 
tasks—that 
subtle, 
involved, 
Jesuitical 
craftiness 
which 
is 
a 
thousand 
times 
more 
subtle 
than 
not 
only 
the 
understanding 
and 
taste 
of 
this 
middle 
class 
is 
at 
its 
best 
moments, 
but 
even 
the 
understanding 
of 
its 
victims—which 
proves 
once 
again 
that 
“instinct” 
is 
of 
all 
the 
kinds 
of 
intelligence 
that 
have 
been 
discovered 
so 
far—the 
most 
intelligent. 
In 
short, 
my 
dear 
psychologists, 
study 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
“norm” 
in 
its 
fight 
against 
the 
“exception”: 
there 
you 
have 
a 
spectacle 
that 
is 
good 
enough 
for 
gods 
and 
godlike 
malice! 
Or, 
still 
more 
clearly: 
vivisect 
the 
“good 
man,” 
the 
“homo 
bonae 
voluntatis”2— 
yourselves! 



219 


Moral 
judgments 
and 
condemnations 
constitute 
the 
favorite 
revenge 
of 
the 
spiritually 
limited 
against 
those 
less 
limited—also 
a 
sort 
of 
compensation 
for 
having 
been 
ill-favored 
by 
nature—finally 
an 
opportunity 
for 
acquiring 
spirit 
and 
becoming 
refined—malice 
spiritualized. 
It 
pleases 
them 
deep 
down 
in 
their 
hearts 
that 
there 
are 
standards 
before 
which 
those 
overflowing 
with 
the 
wealth 
and 
privileges 
of 
the 
spirit 
are 
their 
equals: 
they 
fight 
for 
the 
“equality 
of 
all 
men 
before 
God” 
and 
almost 
need 
faith 
in 
God 
just 
for 
that. 
They 
include 
the 
most 
vigorous 
foes 
of 
atheism. 
Anyone 
who 
said 
to 
them, 
“high 
spirituality 
is 
incomparable 
with 
any 
kind 
of 
solidity 
and 
respectability 
of 
a 
merely 
moral 
man” 
would 
enrage 
them—and 
I 
shall 
beware 
of 
doing 
this. 
Rather 
I 
want 
to 
flatter 
them 
with 
my 
proposition, 
that 
high 
spirituality 
itself 
exists 
only 
as 
the 
ultimate 
product 
of 
moral 
qualities; 
that 
it 
is 
a 
synthesis 
of 
all 
those 
states 
which 
are 
attributed 
to 
“merely 
moral” 
men, 
after 
they 
have 
been 
acquired 
singly 
through 
long 
discipline 
and 
exercise, 
perhaps 
through 
whole 
chains 
of 
generations; 
that 
high 
spirituality 
is 
the 
spiritualization 
of 
justice 
and 
of 
that 
gracious 
severity 
which 
knows 
that 
it 
is 
its 
mission 
to 
maintain 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
in 
the 
world, 
among 
things 
themselves—and 
not 
only 
among 
men. 



220 


In 
view 
of 
the 
modern 
popularity 
of 
praise 
of 
the 
“disinterested,” 
we 
should 
bring 
to 
consciousness, 
perhaps 
not 
without 
some 
danger, 
what 
it 
is 
that 
elicits 
the 
people’s 
interest, 
and 
what 
are 
the 
things 
about 
which 
the 
common 
man 
is 
deeply 
and 
profoundly 
concerned—including 
the 
educated, 
even 
the 
scholars, 
and 
unless 
all 
appearances 
deceive, 
perhaps 
even 
the 
philosophers. 
Then 
the 
fact 
emerges 
that 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
things 
that 
interest 
and 
attract 
choosier 
and 
more 
refined 
tastes 
and 
every 
higher 
nature 
seem 
to 
the 
average 
man 
totally 
“uninteresting”; 
and 
when 
he 
nevertheless 
notices 
a 
devotion 
to 
such 
matters 
he 
calls 
it 
“désintéressé” 
and 
wonders 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
act 
“without 
interest.” 
There 
have 
been 
philosophers 
who 
have 
known 
how 
to 
lend 
to 
this 
popular 
wonder 
a 
seductive 
and 
mystical-transcendental 
expression3 
(—perhaps 
because 
they 
did 
not 
know 
the 
higher 
nature 
from 
experience?)—instead 
of 
positing 
the 
naked 
truth, 
which 
is 
surely 
not 
hard 
to 
come 
by, 
that 
the 
“disinterested” 
action 
is 
an 
exceedingly 
interesting 
and 
interested 
action, 
assuming—— 


“And 
love?”— 
What? 
Even 
an 
action 
done 
from 
love 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
“unegoistic”? 
But 
you 
dolts! 
“And 
the 
praise 
of 
sacrifices?”— 
But 
anyone 
who 
has 
really 
made 
sacrifices 
knows 
that 
he 
wanted 
and 
got 
something 
in 
return—perhaps 
something 
of 
himself 
in 
return 
for 
something 
of 
himself— 
that 
he 
gave 
up 
here 
in 
order 
to 
have 
more 
there, 
perhaps 
in 
order 
to 
be 
more 
or 
at 
least 
to 
feel 
that 
he 
was 
“more.” 
But 
this 
a 
realm 
of 
questions 
and 
answers 
in 
which 
a 
choosier 
spirit 
does 
not 
like 
to 
dwell: 
even 
now 
truth 
finds 
it 
necessary 
to 
stifle 
her 
yawns 
when 
she 
is 
expected 
to 
give 
answers. 
In 
the 
end 
she 
is 
a 
woman: 
she 
should 
not 
be 
violated. 



221 


It 
does 
happen, 
said 
a 
moralistic 
pedant 
and 
dealer 
in 
trifles, 
that 
I 
honor 
and 
exalt 
a 
man 
free 
of 
self-interest—not 
because 
he 
is 
free 
of 
self-interest 
but 
because 
he 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
entitled 
to 
profit 
another 
human 
being 
at 
his 
own 
expense. 
Enough; 
the 
question 
is 
always 
who 
he 
is, 
and 
who 
the 
other 
person 
is. 
In 
a 
person, 
for 
example, 
who 
is 
called 
and 
made 
to 
command, 
self-denial 
and 
modest 
self-effacement 
would 
not 
be 
a 
virtue 
but 
the 
waste 
of 
a 
virtue: 
thus 
it 
seems 
to 
me. 
Every 
unegoistic 
morality 
that 
takes 
itself 
for 
unconditional 
and 
addresses 
itself 
to 
all 
does 
not 
only 
sin 
against 
taste: 
it 
is 
a 
provocation 
to 
sins 
of 
omission, 
one 
more 
seduction 
under 
the 
mask 
of 
philanthropy—and 
precisely 
a 
seduction 
and 
injury 
for 
the 
higher, 
rarer, 
privileged. 
Moralities 
must 
be 
forced 
to 
bow 
first 
of 
all 
before 
the 
order 
of 
rank; 
their 
presumption 
must 
be 
brought 
home 
to 
their 
conscience—until 
they 
finally 
reach 
agreement 
that 
it 
is 
immoral 
to 
say: 
“what 
is 
right 
for 
one 
is 
fair 
for 
the 
other.” 


Thus 
my 
moralistic 
pedant 
and 
bonhomme:4 
does 
he 
deserve 
to 
be 
laughed 
at 
for 
thus 
admonishing 
moralities 
to 
become 
moral? 
But 
one 
should 
not 
be 
too 
right 
if 
one 
wants 
to 
have 
those 
who 
laugh 
on 
one’s 
own 
side; 
a 
grain 
of 
wrong 
actually 
belongs 
to 
good 
taste. 



222 


Where 
pity 
is 
preached 
today—and, 
if 
you 
listen 
closely, 
this 
is 
the 
only 
religion 
preached 
now—psychologists 
should 
keep 
their 
ears 
open: 
through 
all 
the 
vanity, 
through 
all 
the 
noise 
that 
characterizes 
these 
preachers 
(like 
all 
preachers) 
they 
will 
hear 
a 
hoarse, 
groaning, 
genuine 
sound 
of 
self-contempt. 
This 
belongs 
to 
that 
darkening 
and 
uglification 
of 
Europe 
which 
has 
been 
growing 
for 
a 
century 
now 
(and 
whose 
first 
symptoms 
were 
registered 
in 
a 
thoughtful 
letter 
Galiani 
wrote 
to 
Madame 
d’Épinay)5—unless 
it 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
process. 
The 
man 
of 
“modern 
ideas,” 
this 
proud 
ape, 
is 
immeasurably 
dissatisfied 
with 
himself: 
that 
is 
certain. 
He 
suffers—and 
his 
vanity 
wants 
him 
to 
suffer 
only 
with 
others, 
to 
feel 
pity.— 



223 


The 
hybrid 
European—all 
in 
all, 
a 
tolerably 
ugly 
plebeian—simply 
needs 
a 
costume: 
he 
requires 
history 
as 
a 
storage 
room 
for 
costumes. 
To 
be 
sure, 
he 
soon 
notices 
that 
not 
one 
fits 
him 
very 
well; 
so 
he 
keeps 
changing. 
Let 
anyone 
look 
at 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
with 
an 
eye 
for 
these 
quick 
preferences 
and 
changes 
of 
the 
style 
masquerade; 
also 
for 
the 
moments 
of 
despair 
over 
the 
fact 
that 
“nothing 
is 
becoming.” 
It 
is 
no 
use 
to 
parade 
as 
romantic 
or 
classical, 
Christian 
or 
Florentine, 
baroque 
or 
“national,” 
in 
moribus 
et 
artibus: 
it 
“does 
not 
look 
good.” 
But 
the 
“spirit,” 
especially 
the 
“historical 
spirit,” 
finds 
its 
advantage 
even 
in 
this 
despair: 
again 
and 
again 
a 
new 
piece 
of 
prehistory 
or 
a 
foreign 
country 
is 
tried 
on, 
put 
on, 
taken 
off, 
packed 
away, 
and 
above 
all 
studied: 
we 
are 
the 
first 
age 
that 
has 
truly 
studied 
“costumes”— 
I 
mean 
those 
of 
moralities, 
articles 
of 
faith, 
tastes 
in 
the 
arts, 
and 
religions— 
prepared 
like 
no 
previous 
age 
for 
a 
carnival 
in 
the 
grand 
style, 
for 
the 
laughter 
and 
high 
spirits 
of 
the 
most 
spiritual 
revelry, 
for 
the 
transcendental 
heights 
of 
the 
highest 
nonsense 
and 
Aristophanean 
derision 
of 
the 
world. 
Perhaps 
this 
is 
where 
we 
shall 
still 
discover 
the 
realm 
of 
our 
invention, 
that 
realm 
in 
which 
we, 
too, 
can 
still 
be 
original, 
say, 
as 
parodists 
of 
world 
history 
and 
God’s 
buffoons—perhaps, 
even 
if 
nothing 
else 
today 
has 
any 
future, 
our 
laughter 
may 
yet 
have 
a 
future. 



224 


The 
historical 
sense 
(or 
the 
capacity 
for 
quickly 
guessing 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
of 
the 
valuations 
according 
to 
which 
a 
people, 
a 
society, 
a 
human 
being 
has 
lived; 
the 
“divinatory 
instinct” 
for 
the 
relations 
of 
these 
valuations, 
for 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
authority 
of 
values 
to 
the 
authority 
of 
active 
forces)—this 
historical 
sense 
to 
which 
we 
Europeans 
lay 
claim 
as 
our 
specialty 
has 
come 
to 
us 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
that 
enchanting 
and 
mad 
semi-barbarism 
into 
which 
Europe 
had 
been 
plunged 
by 
the 
democratic 
mingling 
of 
classes 
and 
races: 
only 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
knows 
this 
sense, 
as 
its 
sixth 
sense. 
The 
past 
of 
every 
form 
and 
way 
of 
life, 
of 
cultures 
that 
formerly 
lay 
right 
next 
to 
each 
other 
or 
one 
on 
top 
of 
the 
other, 
now 
flows 
into 
us 
“modern 
souls,” 
thanks 
to 
this 
mixture; 
our 
instincts 
now 
run 
back 
everywhere; 
we 
ourselves 
are 
a 
kind 
of 
chaos. 
Finally, 
as 
already 
mentioned, 
“the 
spirit” 
sees 
its 
advantage 
in 
this. 


Through 
our 
semi-barbarism 
in 
body 
and 
desires 
we 
have 
secret 
access 
in 
all 
directions, 
as 
no 
noble 
age 
ever 
did; 
above 
all, 
access 
to 
the 
labyrinths 
of 
unfinished 
cultures 
and 
to 
every 
semi-barbarism 
that 
ever 
existed 
on 
earth. 
And 
insofar 
as 
the 
most 
considerable 
part 
of 
human 
culture 
so 
far 
was 
semi-
barbarism, 
“historical 
sense” 
almost 
means 
the 
sense 
and 
instinct 
for 
everything, 
the 
taste 
and 
tongue 
for 
everything—which 
immediately 
proves 
it 
to 
be 
an 
ignoble 
sense. 
We 
enjoy 
Homer 
again, 
for 
example: 
perhaps 
it 
is 
our 
most 
fortunate 
advantage 
that 
we 
know 
how 
to 
relish 
Homer 
whom 
the 
men 
of 
a 
noble 
culture 
(say, 
the 
French 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
like 
Saint


6

Évremond, 
who 
reproached 
him 
for 
his 
esprit 
vaste, 
and 
even 
their 
afterglow, 
Voltaire) 
cannot 
and 
could 
not 
assimilate 
so 
easily—whom 
to 
enjoy 
they 
scarcely 
permitted 
themselves. 
The 
very 
definite 
Yes 
and 
No 
of 
their 
palate, 
their 
easy 
nausea, 
their 
hesitant 
reserve 
toward 
everything 
foreign, 
their 
horror 
of 
the 
poor 
taste 
even 
of 
a 
lively 
curiosity, 
and 
altogether 
the 
reluctance 
of 
every 
noble 
and 
self-sufficient 
culture 
to 
own 
a 
new 
desire, 
a 
dissatisfaction 
with 
what 
is 
one’s 
own, 
and 
admiration 
for 
what 
is 
foreign— 
all 
this 
inclines 
and 
disposes 
them 
unfavorably 
even 
against 
the 
best 
things 
in 
the 
world 
which 
are 
not 
theirs 
or 
could 
not 
become 
their 
prey. 
No 
sense 
is 
more 
incomprehensible 
for 
such 
people 
than 
the 
historical 
sense 
and 
its 



submissive 
plebeian 
curiosity. 


It 
is 
no 
different 
with 
Shakespeare, 
that 
amazing 
Spanish-Moorish-Saxon 
synthesis 
of 
tastes 
that 
would 
have 
all 
but 
killed 
an 
ancient 
Athenian 
of 
Aeschylus’ 
circle 
with 
laughter 
or 
irritation. 
But 
we—accept 
precisely 
this 
wild 
abundance 
of 
colors, 
this 
medley 
of 
what 
is 
most 
delicate, 
coarsest, 
and 
most 
artificial, 
with 
a 
secret 
familiarity 
and 
cordiality; 
we 
enjoy 
him 
as 
a 
superb 
subtlety 
of 
art 
saved 
up 
especially 
for 
us; 
and 
the 
disgusting 
odors 
and 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
English 
rabble 
in 
which 
Shakespeare’s 
art 
and 
taste 
live 
we 
do 
not 
allow 
to 
disturb 
us 
any 
more 
than 
on 
the 
Chiaja 
of 
Naples, 
where 
we 
go 
our 
way 
with 
all 
our 
senses 
awake, 
enchanted 
and 
willing, 
though 
the 
sewer 
smells 
of 
the 
plebeian 
quarters 
fill 
the 
air. 


As 
men 
of 
the 
“historical 
sense” 
we 
also 
have 
our 
virtues; 
that 
cannot 
be 
denied: 
we 
are 
unpretentious, 
selfless, 
modest, 
courageous, 
full 
of 
self-
overcoming, 
full 
of 
devotion, 
very 
grateful, 
very 
patient, 
very 
accommodating; 
but 
for 
all 
that 
we 
are 
perhaps 
not 
paragons 
of 
good 
taste. 
Let 
us 
finally 
own 
it 
to 
ourselves: 
what 
we 
men 
of 
the 
“historical 
sense” 
find 
most 
difficult 
to 
grasp, 
to 
feel, 
to 
taste 
once 
more, 
to 
love 
once 
more, 
what 
at 
bottom 
finds 
us 
prejudiced 
and 
almost 
hostile, 
is 
precisely 
the 
perfection 
and 
ultimate 
maturity 
of 
every 
culture 
and 
art,7 
that 
which 
is 
really 
noble 
in 
a 
work 
or 
human 
being, 
the 
moment 
when 
their 
sea 
is 
smooth 
and 
they 
have 
found 
halcyon 
self-sufficiency, 
the 
golden 
and 
cold 
aspect 
of 
all 
things 
that 
have 
consummated 
themselves. 


Perhaps 
our 
great 
virtue 
of 
the 
historical 
sense 
is 
necessarily 
opposed 
to 
good 
taste, 
at 
least 
to 
the 
very 
best 
taste; 
and 
precisely 
the 
highest 
little 
strokes 
of 
luck 
and 
transfigurations 
of 
human 
life 
that 
briefly 
light 
up 
here 
and 
there 
we 
can 
recapture 
only 
poorly, 
hesitantly, 
by 
forcing 
ourselves— 
those 
moments 
and 
marvels 
when 
great 
power 
voluntarily 
stopped 
this 
side 
of 
the 
immeasurable 
and 
boundless, 
when 
an 
excess 
of 
subtle 
delight 
in 
sudden 
restraint 
and 
petrification, 
in 
standing 
firm 
and 
taking 
one’s 
measure, 
was 
enjoyed 
on 
still 
trembling 
ground. 
Measure 
is 
alien 
to 
us; 
let 
us 
own 
it; 
our 
thrill 
is 
the 
thrill 
of 
the 
infinite, 
the 
unmeasured. 
Like 
a 
rider 
on 
a 
steed 
that 
flies 
forward, 
we 
drop 
the 
reins 
before 
the 
infinite, 
we 
modern 
men, 
like 
semi-barbarians—and 
reach 
our 
bliss 
only 
where 
we 
are 
most—in 
danger. 



225 


Whether 
it 
is 
hedonism 
or 
pessimism, 
utilitarianism 
or 
eu-daemonism—all 
these 
ways 
of 
thinking 
that 
measure 
the 
value 
of 
things 
in 
accordance 
with 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
which 
are 
mere 
epiphenomena 
and 
wholly 
secondary, 
are 
ways 
of 
thinking 
that 
stay 
in 
the 
foreground 
and 
naïvetés 
on 
which 
everyone 
conscious 
of 
creative 
powers 
and 
an 
artistic 
conscience 
will 
look 
down 
not 
without 
derision, 
nor 
without 
pity. 
Pity 
with 
you—that, 
of 
course, 
is 
not 
pity 
in 
your 
sense: 
it 
is 
not 
pity 
with 
social 
“distress,” 
with 
“society” 
and 
its 
sick 
and 
unfortunate 
members, 
with 
those 
addicted 
to 
vice 
and 
maimed 
from 
the 
start, 
though 
the 
ground 
around 
us 
is 
littered 
with 
them; 
it 
is 
even 
less 
pity 
with 
grumbling, 
sorely 
pressed, 
rebellious 
slave 
strata 
who 
long 
for 
dominion, 
calling 
it 
“freedom.” 
Our 
pity 
is 
a 
higher 
and 
more 
farsighted 
pity: 
we 
see 
how 
man 
makes 
himself 
smaller, 
how 
you 
make 
him 
smaller—and 
there 
are 
moments 
when 
we 
behold 
your 
very 
pity 
with 
indescribable 
anxiety, 
when 
we 
resist 
this 
pity—when 
we 
find 
your 
seriousness 
more 
dangerous 
than 
any 
frivolity. 
You 
want, 
if 
possible—and 
there 
is 
no 
more 
insane 
“if 
possible”—to 
abolish 
suffering. 
And 
we? 
It 
really 
seems 
that 
we 
would 
rather 
have 
it 
higher 
and 
worse 
than 
ever. 
Well-being 
as 
you 
understand 
it—that 
is 
no 
goal, 
that 
seems 
to 
us 
an 
end, 
a 
state 
that 
soon 
makes 
man 
ridiculous 
and 
contemptible—that 
makes 
his 
destruction8 
desirable. 


The 
discipline 
of 
suffering, 
of 
great 
suffering—do 
you 
not 
know 
that 
only 
this 
discipline 
has 
created 
all 
enhancements 
of 
man 
so 
far? 
That 
tension 
of 
the 
soul 
in 
unhappiness 
which 
cultivates 
its 
strength, 
its 
shudders 
face 
to 
face 
with 
great 
ruin, 
its 
inventiveness 
and 
courage 
in 
enduring, 
persevering, 
interpreting, 
and 
exploiting 
suffering, 
and 
whatever 
has 
been 
granted 
to 
it 
of 
profundity, 
secret, 
mask, 
spirit, 
cunning, 
greatness—was 
it 
not 
granted 
to 
it 
through 
suffering, 
through 
the 
discipline 
of 
great 
suffering? 
In 
man 
creature 
and 
creator 
are 
united: 
in 
man 
there 
is 
material, 
fragment, 
excess, 
clay, 
dirt, 
nonsense, 
chaos; 
but 
in 
man 
there 
is 
also 
creator, 
form-giver, 
hammer 
hardness, 
spectator 
divinity, 
and 
seventh 
day: 
do 
you 
understand 
this 
contrast? 
And 
that 
your 
pity 
is 
for 
the 
“creature 
in 
man,” 
for 
what 
must 
be 
formed, 
broken, 
forged, 
torn, 
burnt, 
made 
incandescent, 
and 
purified—that 



which 
necessarily 
must 
and 
should 
suffer? 
And 
our 
pity—do 
you 
not 
comprehend 
for 
whom 
our 
converse 
pity 
is 
when 
it 
resists 
your 
pity 
as 
the 
worst 
of 
all 
pamperings 
and 
weaknesses? 


Thus 
it 
is 
pity 
versus 
pity. 


But 
to 
say 
it 
once 
more: 
there 
are 
higher 
problems 
than 
all 
problems 
of 
pleasure, 
pain, 
and 
pity; 
and 
every 
philosophy 
that 
stops 
with 
them 
is 
a 
naïveté.— 



226 


We 
immoralists!— 
This 
world 
that 
concerns 
us, 
in 
which 
we 
fear 
and 
love, 
this 
almost 
invisible 
and 
inaudible 
world 
of 
subtle 
commanding 
and 
subtle 
obeying, 
in 
every 
way 
a 
world 
of 
the 
“almost,” 
involved, 
captious, 
peaked, 
and 
tender—indeed, 
it 
is 
defended 
well 
against 
clumsy 
spectators 
and 
familiar 
curiosity. 
We 
have 
been 
spun 
into 
a 
severe 
yarn 
and 
shirt 
of 
duties 
and 
cannot 
get 
out 
of 
that—and 
in 
this 
we 
are 
“men 
of 
duty,” 
we, 
too. 
Occasionally, 
that 
is 
true, 
we 
dance 
in 
our 
“chains” 
and 
between 
our 
“swords”; 
more 
often, 
that 
is 
no 
less 
true, 
we 
gnash 
our 
teeth 
and 
feel 
impatient 
with 
all 
the 
secret 
hardness 
of 
our 
destiny. 
But 
we 
can 
do 
what 
we 
like—the 
dolts 
and 
appearances 
speaks 
against 
us, 
saying: 
“These 
are 
men 
without 
duty.” 
We 
always 
have 
the 
dolts 
and 
appearances 
against 
us. 



227 


Honesty,9 
supposing 
that 
this 
is 
our 
virtue 
from 
which 
we 
cannot 
get 
away, 
we 
free 
spirits—well, 
let 
us 
work 
on 
it 
with 
all 
our 
malice 
and 
love 
and 
not 
weary 
of 
“perfecting” 
ourselves 
in 
our 
virtue, 
the 
only 
one 
left 
us. 
May 
its 
splendor 
remain 
spread 
out 
one 
day 
like 
a 
gilded 
blue 
mocking 
evening 
light 
over 
this 
aging 
culture 
and 
its 
musty 
and 
gloomy 
seriousness! 
And 
if 
our 
honesty 
should 
nevertheless 
grow 
weary 
one 
day 
and 
sigh 
and 
stretch 
its 
limbs 
and 
find 
us 
too 
hard, 
and 
would 
like 
to 
have 
things 
better, 
easier, 
tenderer, 
like 
an 
agreeable 
vice—let 
us 
remain 
hard, 
we 
last 
Stoics! 
And 
let 
us 
dispatch 
to 
her 
assistance 
whatever 
we 
have 
in 
us 
of 
devilry: 
our 
disgust 
with 
what 
is 
clumsy 
and 
approximate, 
our 
“nitimur 
in 
vetitum,”10 
our 
adventurous 
courage, 
our 
seasoned 
and 
choosy 
curiosity, 
our 
subtlest, 
most 
disguised, 
most 
spiritual 
will 
to 
power 
and 
overcoming 
of 
the 
world 
that 
flies 
and 
flutters 
covetously 
around 
all 
the 
realms 
of 
the 
future—let 
us 
come 
to 
the 
assistance 
of 
our 
“god” 
with 
all 
our 
“devils”! 


It 
is 
probable 
that 
we 
shall 
be 
misunderstood 
and 
mistaken 
for 
others 
on 
this 
account: 
what 
matter?11 
And 
even 
if 
they 
were 
right! 
Have 
not 
all 
gods 
so 
far 
been 
such 
devils 
who 
have 
become 
holy 
and 
been 
rebaptized? 
And 
what 
ultimately 
do 
we 
know 
of 
ourselves? 
And 
how 
the 
spirit 
that 
leads 
us 
would 
like 
to 
be 
called? 
(It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
names.) 
And 
how 
many 
spirits 
we 
harbor? 


Our 
honesty, 
we 
free 
spirits—let 
us 
see 
to 
it 
that 
it 
does 
not 
become 
our 
vanity, 
our 
finery 
and 
pomp, 
our 
limit, 
our 
stupidity. 
Every 
virtue 
inclines 
toward 
stupidity; 
every 
stupidity, 
toward 
virtue. 
“Stupid 
to 
the 
point 
of 
holiness,” 
they 
say 
in 
Russia; 
let 
us 
see 
to 
it 
that 
out 
of 
honesty 
we 
do 
not 
finally 
become 
saints 
and 
bores. 
Is 
not 
life 
a 
hundred 
times 
too 
short—for 
boredom? 
One 
really 
would 
have 
to 
believe 
in 
eternal 
life 
to—— 



228 


May 
I 
be 
forgiven 
the 
discovery 
that 
all 
moral 
philosophy 
so 
far 
has 
been 
boring 
and 
was 
a 
soporific 
and 
that 
“virtue” 
has 
been 
impaired 
more 
for 
me 
by 
its 
boring 
advocates 
than 
by 
anything 
else, 
though 
I 
am 
not 
denying 
their 
general 
utility. 
It 
is 
important 
that 
as 
few 
people 
as 
possible 
should 
think 
about 
morality; 
hence 
it 
is 
very 
important 
that 
morality 
should 
not 
one 
day 
become 
interesting. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
for 
worry. 
Things 
still 
stand 
today 
as 
they 
have 
always 
stood: 
I 
see 
nobody 
in 
Europe 
who 
has 
(let 
alone, 
promotes) 
any 
awareness 
that 
thinking 
about 
morality 
could 
become 
dangerous, 
captious, 
seductive—that 
there 
might 
be 
any 
calamity 
involved. 


Consider, 
for 
example, 
the 
indefatigable, 
inevitable 
British 
utilitarians, 
how 
they 
walk 
clumsily 
and 
honorably 
in 
Bentham’s 
footsteps, 
walking 
along 
(a 
Homeric 
simile 
says 
it 
more 
plainly), 
even 
as 
he 
himself 
had 
already 
walked 
in 
the 
footsteps 
of 
the 
honorable 
Helvétius12(no, 
he 
was 
no 
dangerous 
person, 
this 
Helvétius, 
ce 
sénateur 
Pococurante,13 
to 
speak 
with 
Galiani). 
Not 
a 
new 
idea, 
no 
trace 
of 
a 
subtler 
version 
or 
twist 
of 
an 
old 
idea, 
not 
even 
a 
real 
history 
of 
what 
had 
been 
thought 
before: 
altogether 
an 
impossible 
literature, 
unless 
one 
knows 
how 
to 
flavor 
it 
with 
some 
malice. 


For 
into 
these 
moralists, 
too 
(one 
simply 
has 
to 
read 
them 
with 
ulterior 
thoughts, 
if 
one 
has 
to 
read 
them), 
that 
old 
English 
vice 
has 
crept 
which 
is 
called 
cant 
and 
consists 
in 
moral 
Tartuffery; 
only 
this 
time 
it 
hides 
in 
a 
new, 
scientific, 
form. 
A 
secret 
fight 
against 
a 
bad 
conscience 
is 
not 
lacking 
either, 
as 
it 
is 
only 
fair 
that 
a 
race 
of 
former 
Puritans 
will 
have 
a 
bad 
conscience 
whenever 
it 
tries 
to 
deal 
with 
morality 
scientifically. 
(Isn’t 
a 
moral 
philosopher 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
Puritan? 
Namely, 
insofar 
as 
he 
is 
a 
thinker 
who 
considers 
morality 
questionable, 
as 
calling 
for 
question 
marks, 
in 
short 
as 
a 
problem? 
Should 
moralizing 
not 
be—immoral?) 


Ultimately 
they 
all 
want 
English 
morality 
to 
be 
proved 
right—because 
this 
serves 
humanity 
best, 
or 
“the 
general 
utility,” 
or 
“the 
happiness 
of 
the 
greatest 
number”—no, 
the 
happiness 
of 
England. 
With 
all 
their 
powers 
they 
want 
to 
prove 
to 
themselves 
that 
the 
striving 
for 
English 
happiness—I 
mean 
for 
comfort 
and 
fashion14 
(and 
at 
best 
a 
seat 
in 
Parliament)—is 
at 
the 
same 



time 
also 
the 
right 
way 
to 
virtue; 
indeed 
that 
whatever 
virtue 
has 
existed 
in 
the 
world 
so 
far 
must 
have 
consisted 
in 
such 
striving. 


None 
of 
these 
ponderous 
herd 
animals 
with 
their 
unquiet 
consciences 
(who 
undertake 
to 
advocate 
the 
cause 
of 
egoism 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
general 
welfare) 
wants 
to 
know 
or 
even 
sense 
that 
“the 
general 
welfare” 
is 
no 
ideal, 
no 
goal, 
no 
remotely 
intelligible 
concept, 
but 
only 
an 
emetic—that 
what 
is 
fair 
for 
one 
cannot 
by 
any 
means 
for 
that 
reason 
alone 
also 
be 
fair 
for 
others; 
that 
the 
demand 
of 
one 
morality 
for 
all 
is 
detrimental 
for 
the 
higher 
men; 
in 
short, 
that 
there 
is 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
between 
man 
and 
man, 
hence 
also 
between 
morality 
and 
morality. 
They 
are 
a 
modest 
and 
thoroughly 
mediocre 
type 
of 
man, 
these 
utilitarian 
Englishmen, 
and, 
as 
said 
above, 
insofar 
as 
they 
are 
boring 
one 
cannot 
think 
highly 
enough 
of 
their 
utility. 
They 
should 
even 
be 
encouraged: 
the 
following 
rhymes 
represent 
an 
effort 
in 
this 
direction. 


Hail, 
dear 
drudge 
and 
patient 
fretter! 
“More 
drawn 
out 
is 
always 
better,” 
Stiffness 
grows 
in 
head 
and 
knee, 
No 
enthusiast 
and 
no 
joker, 
Indestructibly 
mediocre, 
Sans 
génie 
et 
sans 
esprit!15

In 
late 
ages 
that 
may 
be 
proud 
of 
their 
humanity, 
so 
much 
fear 
remains, 
so 
much 
superstitious 
fear 
of 
the 
“savage 
cruel 
beast” 
whose 
conquest 
is 
the 
very 
pride 
of 
these 
more 
humane 
ages, 
that 
even 
palpable 
truths 
remain 
unspoken 
for 
centuries, 
as 
if 
by 
some 
agreement, 
because 
they 
look 
as 
if 
they 
might 
reanimate 
that 
savage 
beast 
one 
has 
finally 
“mortified.” 
Perhaps 
I 
dare 
something 
when 
I 
let 
one 
of 
these 
truths 
slip 
out: 
let 
others 
catch 
it 
again 
and 
give 
it 
“milk 
of 
the 
pious 
ways 
of 
thinking”16 
to 
drink 
until 
it 
lies 
still 
and 
forgotten 
in 
its 
old 
corner. 


We 
should 
reconsider 
cruelty 
and 
open 
our 
eyes. 
We 
should 
at 
long 
last 
learn 
impatience 
lest 
such 
immodest 
fat 
errors 
keep 
on 
strutting 
about 
virtuously 
and 
saucily, 
as 
have 
been 
fostered 
about 
tragedy, 
for 
example, 
by 
philosophers 
both 
ancient 
and 
modern. 
Almost 
everything 
we 
call 
“higher 
culture” 
is 
based 
on 
the 
spiritualization 
of 
cruelty, 
on 
its 
becoming 
more 
profound: 
this 
is 
my 
proposition. 
That 
“savage 
animal” 
has 
not 
really 
been 
“mortified”; 
it 
lives 
and 
flourishes, 
it 
has 
merely 
become—divine. 


What 
constitutes 
the 
painful 
voluptuousness 
of 
tragedy 
is 
cruelty; 
what 
seems 
agreeable 
in 
so-called 
tragic 
pity, 
and 
at 
bottom 
in 
everything 
sublime, 
up 
to 
the 
highest 
and 
most 
delicate 
shudders 
of 
metaphysics, 
receives 
its 
sweetness 
solely 
from 
the 
admixture 
of 
cruelty. 
What 
the 
Roman 
in 
the 
arena, 
the 
Christian 
in 
the 
ecstasies 
of 
the 
cross, 
the 
Spaniard 
at 
an 
auto-da-fe 
or 
bullfight, 
the 
Japanese 
of 
today 
when 
he 
flocks 
to 
tragedies, 
the 
laborer 
in 
a 
Parisian 
suburb 
who 
feels 
a 
nostalgia 
for 
bloody 
revolutions, 
the 
Wagnerienne 
who 
“submits 
to” 
Tristan 
and 
Isolde, 
her 
will 
suspended—what 
all 
of 
them 
enjoy 
and 
seek 
to 
drink 
in 
with 
mysterious 
ardor 
are 
the 
spicy 
potions 
of 
the 
great 
Circe, 
“cruelty.” 


To 
see 
this 
we 
must, 
of 
course, 
chase 
away 
the 
clumsy 
psychology 
of 
bygone 
times 
which 
had 
nothing 
to 
teach 
about 
cruelty 
except 
that 
it 
came 
into 
being 
at 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
sufferings 
of 
others. 
There 
is 
also 
an 
abundant, 
over-abundant 
enjoyment 
at 
one’s 
own 
suffering, 
at 
making 
oneself 
suffer— 
and 
wherever 
man 
allows 
himself 
to 
be 
persuaded 
to 
self-denial 
in 
the 
religious 
sense, 
or 
to 
self-mutilation, 
as 
among 
Phoenicians 
and 
ascetics, 
or 



altogether 
to 
de-sensualization, 
decarnalization, 
contrition, 
Puritanical 
spasms 
of 
penitence, 
vivisection 
of 
the 
conscience, 
and 
sacrifizio 
dell’intelletto17 
à 
la 
Pascal, 
he 
is 
secretly 
lured 
and 
pushed 
forward 
by 
his 
cruelty, 
by 
those 
dangerous 
thrills 
of 
cruelty 
turned 
against 
oneself. 


Finally 
consider 
that 
even 
the 
seeker 
after 
knowledge 
forces 
his 
spirit 
to 
recognize 
things 
against 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
spirit, 
and 
often 
enough 
also 
against 
the 
wishes 
of 
his 
heart—by 
way 
of 
saying 
No 
where 
he 
would 
like 
to 
say 
Yes, 
love, 
and 
adore—and 
thus 
acts 
as 
an 
artist 
and 
transfigurer 
of 
cruelty. 
Indeed, 
any 
insistence 
on 
profundity 
and 
thoroughness 
is 
a 
violation, 
a 
desire 
to 
hurt 
the 
basic 
will 
of 
the 
spirit 
which 
unceasingly 
strives 
for 
the 
apparent 
and 
superficial—in 
all 
desire 
to 
know 
there 
is 
a 
drop 
of 
cruelty. 



230 


What 
I 
have 
just 
said 
of 
a 
“basic 
will 
of 
the 
spirit” 
may 
not 
be 
readily 
understood: 
permit 
me 
an 
explanation. 


That 
commanding 
something 
which 
the 
people 
call 
“the 
spirit” 
wants 
to 
be 
master 
in 
and 
around 
its 
own 
house 
and 
wants 
to 
feel 
that 
it 
is 
master; 
it 
has 
the 
will 
from 
multiplicity 
to 
simplicity, 
a 
will 
that 
ties 
up, 
tames, 
and 
is 
domineering 
and 
truly 
masterful. 
Its 
needs 
and 
capacities 
are 
so 
far 
the 
same 
as 
those 
which 
physiologists 
posit 
for 
everything 
that 
lives, 
grows, 
and 
multiplies. 
The 
spirit’s 
power 
to 
appropriate 
the 
foreign 
stands 
revealed 
in 
its 
inclination 
to 
assimilate 
the 
new 
to 
the 
old, 
to 
simplify 
the 
manifold, 
and 
to 
overlook 
or 
repulse 
whatever 
is 
totally 
contradictory—just 
as 
it 
involuntarily 
emphasizes 
certain 
features 
and 
lines 
in 
what 
is 
foreign, 
in 
every 
piece 
of 
the 
“external 
world,” 
retouching 
and 
falsifying 
the 
whole 
to 
suit 
itself. 
Its 
intent 
in 
all 
this 
is 
to 
incorporate 
new 
“experiences,” 
to 
file 
new 
things 
in 
old 
files 
—growth, 
in 
a 
word—or, 
more 
precisely, 
the 
feeling 
of 
growth, 
the 
feeling 
of 
increased 
power. 


An 
apparently 
opposite 
drive 
serves 
this 
same 
will: 
a 
suddenly 
erupting 
decision 
in 
favor 
of 
ignorance, 
of 
deliberate 
exclusion, 
a 
shutting 
of 
one’s 
windows, 
an 
internal 
No 
to 
this 
or 
that 
thing, 
a 
refusal 
to 
let 
things 
approach, 
a 
kind 
of 
state 
of 
defense 
against 
much 
that 
is 
knowable, 
a 
satisfaction 
with 
the 
dark, 
with 
the 
limiting 
horizon, 
a 
Yea 
and 
Amen 
to 
ignorance—all 
of 
which 
is 
necessary 
in 
proportion 
to 
a 
spirit’s 
power 
to 
appropriate, 
its 
“digestive 
capacity,” 
to 
speak 
metaphorically—and 
actually 
“the 
spirit” 
is 
relatively 
most 
similar 
to 
a 
stomach. 


Here 
belongs 
also 
the 
occasional 
will 
of 
the 
spirit 
to 
let 
itself 
be 
deceived, 
perhaps 
with 
a 
capricious 
intimation 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
and 
such 
is 
not 
the 
case, 
that 
one 
merely 
accepts 
such 
and 
such 
a 
delight 
in 
all 
uncertainty 
and 
ambiguity, 
a 
jubilant 
self-enjoyment 
in 
the 
arbitrary 
narrowness 
and 
secrecy 
of 
some 
nook, 
in 
the 
all 
too 
near, 
in 
the 
foreground, 
in 
what 
is 
enlarged, 
diminished, 
displaced, 
beautified, 
a 
self-enjoyment 
in 
the 
caprice 
of 
all 
these 
expressions 
of 
power. 


Here 
belongs 
also, 
finally, 
that 
by 
no 
means 
unproblematic 
readiness 
of 
the 
spirit 
to 
deceive 
other 
spirits 
and 
to 
dissimulate 
in 
front 
of 
them, 
that 



continual 
urge 
and 
surge 
of 
a 
creative, 
form-giving, 
changeable 
force: 
in 
this 
the 
spirit 
enjoys 
the 
multiplicity 
and 
craftiness 
of 
its 
masks, 
it 
also 
enjoys 
the 
feeling 
of 
its 
security 
behind 
them: 
after 
all, 
it 
is 
surely 
its 
Protean 
arts 
that 
defend 
and 
conceal 
it 
best. 


This 
will 
to 
mere 
appearance, 
to 
simplification, 
to 
masks, 
to 
cloaks, 
in 
short, 
to 
the 
surface—for 
every 
surface 
is 
a 
cloak—is 
countered 
by 
that 
sublime 
inclination 
of 
the 
seeker 
after 
knowledge 
who 
insists 
on 
profundity, 
multiplicity, 
and 
thoroughness, 
with 
a 
will 
which 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
cruelty 
of 
the 
intellectual 
conscience 
and 
taste. 
Every 
courageous 
thinker 
will 
recognize 
this 
in 
himself, 
assuming 
only 
that, 
as 
fit, 
he 
has 
hardened 
and 
sharpened 
his 
eye 
for 
himself 
long 
enough 
and 
that 
he 
is 
used 
to 
severe 
discipline, 
as 
well 
as 
severe 
words. 
He 
will 
say: 
“there 
is 
something 
cruel 
in 
the 
inclination 
of 
my 
spirit”; 
let 
the 
virtuous 
and 
kindly 
try 
to 
talk 
him 
out 
of 
that! 


Indeed, 
it 
would 
sound 
nicer 
if 
we 
were 
said, 
whispered, 
reputed18 
to 
be 
distinguished 
not 
by 
cruelty 
but 
by 
“extravagant 
honesty,” 
we 
free, 
very 
free 
spirits—and 
perhaps 
that 
will 
actually 
be 
our—posthumous 
reputation.19 
Meanwhile—for 
there 
is 
plenty 
of 
time 
until 
then—we 
ourselves 
are 
probably 
least 
inclined 
to 
put 
on 
the 
garish 
finery 
of 
such 
moral 
word 
tinsels: 
our 
whole 
work 
so 
far 
makes 
us 
sick 
of 
this 
taste 
and 
its 
cheerful 
luxury. 
These 
are 
beautiful, 
glittering, 
jingling, 
festive 
words: 
honesty, 
love 
of 
truth, 
love 
of 
wisdom, 
sacrifice 
for 
knowledge, 
heroism 
of 
the 
truthful—they 
have 
something 
that 
swells 
one’s 
pride. 
But 
we 
hermits 
and 
marmots 
have 
long 
persuaded 
ourselves 
in 
the 
full 
secrecy 
of 
a 
hermit’s 
conscience 
that 
this 
worthy 
verbal 
pomp, 
too, 
belongs 
to 
the 
old 
mendacious 
pomp, 
junk, 
and 
gold 
dust 
of 
unconscious 
human 
vanity, 
and 
that 
under 
such 
flattering 
colors 
and 
make-up 
as 
well, 
the 
basic 
text 
of 
homo 
natura 
must 
again 
be 
recognized. 


To 
translate 
man 
back 
into 
nature; 
to 
become 
master 
over 
the 
many 
vain 
and 
overly 
enthusiastic 
interpretations 
and 
connotations 
that 
have 
so 
far 
been 
scrawled 
and 
painted 
over 
that 
eternal 
basic 
text 
of 
homo 
natura; 
to 
see 
to 
it 
that 
man 
henceforth 
stands 
before 
man 
as 
even 
today, 
hardened 
in 
the 
discipline 
of 
science, 
he 
stands 
before 
the 
rest 
of 
nature, 
with 
intrepid 
Oedipus 
eyes 
and 
sealed 
Odysseus 
ears, 
deaf 
to 
the 
siren 
songs 
of 
old 
metaphysical 
bird 
catchers 
who 
have 
been 
piping 
at 
him 
all 
too 
long, 
“you 
are 
more, 
you 
are 
higher, 
you 
are 
of 
a 
different 
origin!”—that 
may 
be 
a 
strange 
and 
insane 
task, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
task—who 
would 
deny 
that? 
Why 
did 
we 
choose 
this 
insane 
task? 
Or, 
putting 
it 
differently: 
“why 
have 
knowledge 
at 
all?” 



Everybody 
will 
ask 
us 
that. 
And 
we, 
pressed 
this 
way, 
we 
who 
have 
put 
the 
same 
question 
to 
ourselves 
a 
hundred 
times, 
we 
have 
found 
and 
find 
no 
better 
answer— 



231 


Learning 
changes 
us; 
it 
does 
what 
all 
nourishment 
does 
which 
also 
does 
not 
merely 
“preserve”—as 
physiologists 
know. 
But 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
us, 
really 
“deep 
down,” 
there 
is, 
of 
course, 
something 
unteachable, 
some 
granite 
of 
spiritual 
fatum,20 
of 
predetermined 
decision 
and 
answer 
to 
predetermined 
selected 
questions. 
Whenever 
a 
cardinal 
problem 
is 
at 
stake, 
there 
speaks 
an 
unchangeable 
“this 
is 
I”; 
about 
man 
and 
woman, 
for 
example, 
a 
thinker 
cannot 
relearn 
but 
only 
finish 
learning—only 
discover 
ultimately 
how 
this 
is 
“settled 
in 
him.” 
At 
times 
we 
find 
certain 
solutions 
of 
problems 
that 
inspire 
strong 
faith 
in 
us; 
some 
call 
them 
henceforth 
their 
“convictions.” 
Later—we 
see 
them 
only 
as 
steps 
to 
self-knowledge, 
signposts 
to 
the 
problem 
we 
are— 
rather, 
to 
the 
great 
stupidity 
we 
are, 
to 
our 
spiritual 
fatum, 
to 
what 
is 
unteachable 
very 
“deep 
down.”21 


After 
this 
abundant 
civility 
that 
I 
have 
just 
evidenced 
in 
relation 
to 
myself 
I 
shall 
perhaps 
be 
permitted 
more 
readily 
to 
state 
a 
few 
truths 
about 
“woman 
as 
such”—assuming 
that 
it 
is 
now 
known 
from 
the 
outset 
how 
very 
much 
these 
are 
after 
all 
only—my 
truths. 



232 


Woman 
wants 
to 
become 
self-reliant—and 
for 
that 
reason 
she 
is 
beginning 
to 
enlighten 
men 
about 
“woman 
as 
such”: 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
worst 
developments 
of 
the 
general 
uglification 
of 
Europe. 
For 
what 
must 
these 
clumsy 
attempts 
of 
women 
at 
scientific 
self-exposure 
bring 
to 
light! 
Woman 
has 
much 
reason 
for 
shame; 
so 
much 
pedantry, 
superficiality, 
schoolmarmishness, 
petty 
presumption, 
petty 
licentiousness 
and 
immodesty 
lies 
concealed 
in 
woman—one 
only 
needs 
to 
study 
her 
behavior 
with 
children!—and 
so 
far 
all 
this 
was 
at 
bottom 
best 
repressed 
and 
kept 
under 
control 
by 
fear 
of 
man. 
Woe 
when 
“the 
eternally 
boring 
in 
woman”22—she 
is 
rich 
in 
that!—is 
permitted 
to 
venture 
forth! 
When 
she 
begins 
to 
unlearn 
thoroughly 
and 
on 
principle 
her 
prudence 
and 
art—of 
grace, 
of 
play, 
of 
chasing 
away 
worries, 
of 
lightening 
burdens 
and 
taking 
things 
lightly—and 
her 
subtle 
aptitude 
for 
agreeable 
desires! 


Even 
now 
female 
voices 
are 
heard 
which—holy 
Aristophanes!—are 
frightening: 
they 
threaten 
with 
medical 
explicitness 
what 
woman 
wants 
from 
man, 
first 
and 
last. 
Is 
it 
not 
in 
the 
worst 
taste 
when 
woman 
sets 
about 
becoming 
scientific 
that 
way? 
So 
far 
enlightenment 
of 
this 
sort 
was 
fortunately 
man’s 
affair, 
man’s 
lot—we 
remained 
“among 
ourselves” 
in 
this; 
and 
whatever 
women 
write 
about 
“woman,” 
we 
may 
in 
the 
end 
reserve 
a 
healthy 
suspicion 
whether 
woman 
really 
wants 
enlightenment 
about 
herself— 
whether 
she 
can 
will 
it— 


Unless 
a 
woman 
seeks 
a 
new 
adornment 
for 
herself 
that 
way—I 
do 
think 
adorning 
herself 
is 
part 
of 
the 
Eternal-Feminine?—she 
surely 
wants 
to 
inspire 
fear 
of 
herself—perhaps 
she 
seeks 
mastery. 
But 
she 
does 
not 
want 
truth: 
what 
is 
truth 
to 
woman? 
From 
the 
beginning, 
nothing 
has 
been 
more 
alien, 
repugnant, 
and 
hostile 
to 
woman 
than 
truth—her 
great 
art 
is 
the 
lie, 
her 
highest 
concern 
is 
mere 
appearance 
and 
beauty. 
Let 
us 
men 
confess 
it: 
we 
honor 
and 
love 
precisely 
this 
art 
and 
this 
instinct 
in 
woman—we 
who 
have 
a 
hard 
time 
and 
for 
our 
relief 
like 
to 
associate 
with 
beings 
under 
whose 
hands, 
eyes, 
and 
tender 
follies 
our 
seriousness, 
our 
gravity 
and 
profundity23 
almost 
appear 
to 
us 
like 
folly. 



Finally 
I 
pose 
the 
question: 
has 
ever 
a 
woman 
conceded 
profundity 
to 
a 
woman’s 
head, 
or 
justice 
to 
a 
woman’s 
heart? 
And 
is 
it 
not 
true 
that 
on 
the 
whole 
“woman” 
has 
so 
far 
been 
despised 
most 
by 
woman 
herself—and 
by 
no 
means 
by 
us? 


We 
men 
wish 
that 
woman 
should 
not 
go 
on 
compromising 
herself 
through 
enlightenment—just 
as 
it 
was 
man’s 
thoughtfulness 
and 
consideration 
for 
woman 
that 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
church 
decree: 
mulier 
taceat 
in 
ecclesia!24 
It 
was 
for 
woman’s 
good 
when 
Napoleon 
gave 
the 
all 
too 
eloquent 
Madame 
de 
Staël 
to 
understand: 
mulier 
taceat 
in 
politicis!25 
And 
I 
think 
it 
is 
a 
real 
friend 
of 
women 
that 
counsels 
them 
today: 
mulier 
taceat 
de 
muliere!26 



233 


It 
betrays 
a 
corruption 
of 
the 
instincts—quite 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
betrays 
bad 
taste—when 
a 
woman 
adduces 
Madame 
Roland 
or 
Madame 
de 
Staël 
or 
Monsieur 
George 
Sand, 
of 
all 
people, 
as 
if 
they 
proved 
anything 
in 
favor 
of 
“woman 
as 
such.” 
Among 
men 
these 
three 
are 
the 
three 
comical 
women 
as 
such—nothing 
more!—and 
precisely 
the 
best 
involuntary 
counterarguments 
against 
emancipation 
and 
feminine 
vainglory. 



234 


Stupidity 
in 
the 
kitchen; 
woman 
as 
cook: 
the 
gruesome 
thoughtlessness 
to 
which 
the 
feeding 
of 
the 
family 
and 
of 
the 
master 
of 
the 
house 
is 
abandoned! 
Woman 
does 
not 
understand 
what 
food 
means—and 
wants 
to 
be 
cook. 
If 
woman 
were 
a 
thinking 
creature, 
she, 
as 
cook 
for 
millennia, 
would 
surely 
have 
had 
to 
discover 
the 
greatest 
physiological 
facts, 
and 
she 
would 
have 
had 
to 
gain 
possession 
of 
the 
art 
of 
healing. 
Bad 
cooks—and 
the 
utter 
lack 
of 
reason 
in 
the 
kitchen—have 
delayed 
human 
development 
longest 
and 
impaired 
it 
most: 
nor 
have 
things 
improved 
much 
even 
today.

There 
are 
expressions 
and 
bull’s-eyes 
of 
the 
spirit, 
there 
are 
epigrams, 
a 
little 
handful 
of 
words, 
in 
which 
a 
whole 
culture, 
a 
whole 
society 
is 
suddenly 
crystallized. 
Among 
these 
belongs 
the 
occasional 
remark 
of 
Madame 
de 
Lambert 
to 
her 
son: 
“mon 
ami, 
ne 
vous 
permettez 
jamais 
que 
de 
folies, 
qui 
vous 
feront 
grand 
plaisir”27—incidentally 
the 
most 
motherly 
and 
prudent 
word 
ever 
directed 
to 
a 
son.

What 
Dante 
and 
Goethe 
believed 
about 
woman—the 
former 
when 
he 
sang, 
“ella 
guardava 
suso, 
ed 
io 
in 
lei,”28 
and 
the 
latter 
when 
he 
translated 
this, 
“the 
Eternal-Feminine 
attracts 
us 
higher”—I 
do 
not 
doubt 
that 
every 
nobler 
woman 
will 
resist 
this 
faith, 
for 
she 
believes 
the 
same 
thing 
about 
the 
Eternal-
Masculine—

SEVEN 
EPIGRAMS 
ON 
WOMAN 



How 
the 
longest 
boredom 
flees, 
when 
a 
man 
comes 
on 
his 
knees! 



Science 
and 
old 
age 
at 
length 
give 
weak 
virtue, 
too, 
some 
strength. 



Black 
dress 
and 
a 
silent 
part 
make 
every 
woman 
appear—smart. 



Whom 
I 
thank 
for 
my 
success? 
God!—and 
my 
dear 
tailoress. 



Young: 
flower-covered 
den. 
Old: 
a 
dragon 
denizen. 



Noble 
name, 
the 
legs 
are 
fine, 
man 
as 
well: 
that 
he 
were 
mine! 



Ample 
meaning, 
speech 
concise29—she-ass, 
watch 
for 
slippery 
ice! 




237a30 


Men 
have 
so 
far 
treated 
women 
like 
birds 
who 
had 
strayed 
to 
them 
from 
some 
height: 
as 
something 
more 
refined 
and 
vulnerable, 
wilder, 
stranger, 
sweeter, 
and 
more 
soulful—but 
as 
something 
one 
has 
to 
lock 
up 
lest 
it 
fly 
away. 



238 


To 
go 
wrong 
on 
the 
fundamental 
problem 
of 
“man 
and 
woman,” 
to 
deny 
the 
most 
abysmal 
antagonism 
between 
them 
and 
the 
necessity 
of 
an 
eternally 
hostile 
tension, 
to 
dream 
perhaps 
of 
equal 
rights, 
equal 
education, 
equal 
claims 
and 
obligations—that 
is 
a 
typical 
sign 
of 
shallowness, 
and 
a 
thinker 
who 
has 
proved 
shallow 
in 
this 
dangerous 
place—shallow 
in 
his 
instinct— 
may 
be 
considered 
altogether 
suspicious, 
even 
more—betrayed, 
exposed: 
probably 
he 
will 
be 
too 
“short” 
for 
all 
fundamental 
problems 
of 
life, 
of 
the 
life 
yet 
to 
come, 
too, 
and 
incapable 
of 
attaining 
any 
depth.31 
A 
man, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
who 
has 
depth, 
in 
his 
spirit 
as 
well 
as 
in 
his 
desires, 
including 
that 
depth 
of 
benevolence 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
severity 
and 
hardness 
and 
easily 
mistaken 
for 
them, 
must 
always 
think 
about 
woman 
as 
Orientals 
do: 
he 
must 
conceive 
of 
woman 
as 
a 
possession, 
as 
property 
that 
can 
be 
locked, 
as 
something 
predestined 
for 
service 
and 
achieving 
her 
perfection 
in 
that. 
Here 
he 
must 
base 
himself 
on 
the 
tremendous 
reason 
of 
Asia, 
on 
Asia’s 
superiority 
in 
the 
instincts, 
as 
the 
Greeks 
did 
formerly, 
who 
were 
Asia’s 
best 
heirs 
and 
students: 
as 
is 
well 
known, 
from 
Homer’s 
time 
to 
the 
age 
of 
Pericles, 
as 
their 
culture 
increased 
along 
with 
the 
range 
of 
their 
powers, 
they 
also 
gradually 
became 
more 
severe, 
in 
brief, 
more 
Oriental, 
against 
woman. 
How 
necessary, 
how 
logical, 
how 
humanely 
desirable 
even, 
this 
was—is 
worth 
pondering. 



239 


In 
no 
age 
has 
the 
weaker 
sex 
been 
treated 
with 
as 
much 
respect 
by 
men 
as 
in 
ours: 
that 
belongs 
to 
the 
democratic 
inclination 
and 
basic 
taste, 
just 
like 
disrespectfulness 
for 
old 
age. 
No 
wonder 
that 
this 
respect 
is 
immediately 
abused. 
One 
wants 
more, 
one 
learns 
to 
demand, 
finally 
one 
almost 
finds 
this 
tribute 
of 
respect 
insulting, 
one 
would 
prefer 
competition 
for 
rights, 
indeed 
even 
a 
genuine 
fight: 
enough, 
woman 
loses 
her 
modesty. 
Let 
us 
immediately 
add 
that 
she 
also 
loses 
taste. 
She 
unlearns 
her 
fear 
of 
man: 
but 
the 
woman 
who 
“unlearns 
fear” 
surrenders 
her 
most 
womanly 
instincts. 


That 
woman 
ventures 
forth 
when 
the 
aspect 
of 
man 
that 
inspires 
fear—let 
us 
say 
more 
precisely, 
when 
the 
man 
in 
man 
is 
no 
longer 
desired 
and 
cultivated—that 
is 
fair 
enough, 
also 
comprehensible 
enough. 
What 
is 
harder 
to 
comprehend 
is 
that, 
by 
the 
same 
token—woman 
degenerates. 
This 
is 
what 
is 
happening 
today: 
let 
us 
not 
deceive 
ourselves 
about 
that. 


Wherever 
the 
industrial 
spirit 
has 
triumphed 
over 
the 
military 
and 
aristocratic 
spirit, 
woman 
now 
aspires 
to 
the 
economic 
and 
legal 
self-reliance 
of 
a 
clerk:32 
“woman 
as 
clerk” 
is 
inscribed 
on 
the 
gate 
to 
the 
modern 
society 
that 
is 
taking 
shape 
now. 
As 
she 
thus 
takes 
possession 
of 
new 
rights, 
aspires 
to 
become 
“master”33 
and 
writes 
the 
“progress” 
of 
woman 
upon 
her 
standards 
and 
banners, 
the 
opposite 
development 
is 
taking 
place 
with 
terrible 
clarity: 
woman 
is 
retrogressing. 


Since 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
woman’s 
influence 
in 
Europe 
has 
decreased 
proportionately 
as 
her 
rights 
and 
claims 
have 
increased; 
and 
the 
“emancipation 
of 
woman,” 
insofar 
as 
that 
is 
demanded 
and 
promoted 
by 
women 
themselves 
(and 
not 
merely 
by 
shallow 
males) 
is 
thus 
seen 
to 
be 
an 
odd 
symptom 
of 
the 
increasing 
weakening 
and 
dulling 
of 
the 
most 
feminine 
instincts. 
There 
is 
stupidity 
in 
this 
movement, 
an 
almost 
masculine 
stupidity 
of 
which 
a 
woman 
who 
had 
turned 
out 
well—and 
such 
women 
are 
always 
prudent—would 
have 
to 
be 
thoroughly 
ashamed. 


To 
lose 
the 
sense 
for 
the 
ground 
on 
which 
one 
is 
most 
certain 
of 
victory; 
to 
neglect 
practice 
with 
one’s 
proper 
weapons; 
to 
let 
oneself 
go 
before 
men, 
perhaps 
even 
“to 
the 
point 
of 
writing 
a 
book,” 
when 
formerly 
one 
disciplined 



oneself 
to 
subtle 
and 
cunning 
humility; 
to 
work 
with 
virtuous 
audacity 
against 
men’s 
faith 
in 
a 
basically 
different 
ideal 
that 
he 
takes 
to 
be 
concealed 
in 
woman, 
something 
Eternally-and-Necessarily-Feminine—to 
talk 
men 
emphatically 
and 
loquaciously 
out 
of 
their 
notion 
that 
woman 
must 
be 
maintained, 
taken 
care 
of, 
protected, 
and 
indulged 
like 
a 
more 
delicate, 
strangely 
wild, 
and 
often 
pleasant 
domestic 
animal; 
the 
awkward 
and 
indignant 
search 
for 
everything 
slavelike 
and 
serflike 
that 
has 
characterized 
woman’s 
position 
in 
the 
order 
of 
society 
so 
far, 
and 
still 
does 
(as 
if 
slavery 
were 
a 
counterargument 
and 
not 
instead 
a 
condition 
of 
every 
higher 
culture, 
every 
enhancement 
of 
culture)—what 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
this 
if 
not 
a 
crumbling 
of 
feminine 
instincts, 
a 
defeminization? 


To 
be 
sure, 
there 
are 
enough 
imbecilic 
friends 
and 
corrupters 
of 
woman 
among 
the 
scholarly 
asses 
of 
the 
male 
sex 
who 
advise 
woman 
to 
defeminize 
herself 
in 
this 
way 
and 
to 
imitate 
all 
the 
stupidities 
with 
which 
“man” 
in 
Europe, 
European 
“manliness,” 
is 
sick: 
they 
would 
like 
to 
reduce 
woman 
to 
the 
level 
of 
“general 
education,” 
probably 
even 
of 
reading 
the 
newspapers 
and 
talking 
about 
politics. 
Here 
and 
there 
they 
even 
want 
to 
turn 
women 
into 
freethinkers 
and 
scribblers—as 
if 
a 
woman 
without 
piety 
would 
not 
seem 
utterly 
obnoxious 
and 
ridiculous 
to 
a 
profound 
and 
godless 
man. 


Almost 
everywhere 
one 
ruins 
her 
nerves 
with 
the 
most 
pathological 
and 
dangerous 
kind 
of 
music 
(our 
most 
recent 
German 
music) 
and 
makes 
her 
more 
hysterical 
by 
the 
day 
and 
more 
incapable 
of 
her 
first 
and 
last 
profession 
—to 
give 
birth 
to 
strong 
children. 
Altogether 
one 
wants 
to 
make 
her 
more 
“cultivated” 
and, 
as 
is 
said, 
make 
the 
weaker 
sex 
strong 
through 
culture—as 
if 
history 
did 
not 
teach 
us 
as 
impressively 
as 
possible 
that 
making 
men 
“cultivated” 
and 
making 
them 
weak—weakening, 
splintering, 
and 
sick-lying 
over 
the 
force 
of 
the 
will—have 
always 
kept 
pace, 
and 
that 
the 
most 
powerful 
and 
influential 
women 
of 
the 
world 
(most 
recently 
Napoleon’s 
mother) 
owed 
their 
power 
and 
ascendancy 
over 
men 
to 
the 
force 
of 
their 
will—and 
not 
to 
schoolmasters! 


What 
inspires 
respect 
for 
woman, 
and 
often 
enough 
even 
fear, 
is 
her 
nature, 
which 
is 
more 
“natural” 
than 
man’s, 
the 
genuine, 
cunning 
suppleness 
of 
a 
beast 
of 
prey, 
the 
tiger’s 
claw 
under 
the 
glove, 
the 
naïveté 
of 
her 
egoism, 
her 
uneducability 
and 
inner 
wildness, 
the 
incomprehensibility, 
scope, 
and 
movement 
of 
her 
desires 
and 
virtues— 


What, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
fear, 
elicits 
pity 
for 
this 
dangerous 
and 
beautiful 
cat 
“woman” 
is 
that 
she 
appears 
to 
suffer 
more, 
to 
be 
more 
vulnerable, 
more 
in 



need 
of 
love, 
and 
more 
condemned 
to 
disappointment 
than 
any 
other 
animal. 
Fear 
and 
pity: 
with 
these 
feelings 
man 
has 
so 
far 
confronted 
woman, 
always 
with 
one 
foot 
in 
tragedy34 
which 
tears 
to 
pieces 
as 
it 
enchants.35 
What? 
And 
this 
should 
be 
the 
end? 
And 
the 
breaking 
of 
woman’s 
magic 
spell 
is 
at 
work? 
The 
“borification” 
of 
woman 
is 
slowly 
dawning? 
O 
Europe! 
Europe! 
We 
know 
the 
horned 
animal 
you 
always 
found 
most 
attractive; 
it 
still 
threatens 
you! 
Your 
old 
fable 
could 
yet 
become 
“history”—once 
more 
an 
immense 
stupidity 
might 
become 
master 
over 
you 
and 
carry 
you 
off. 
And 
this 
time 
no 
god 
would 
hide 
in 
it; 
no, 
only 
an 
“idea,” 
a 
“modern 
idea”!——

What 
the 
“moralistic 
pedant” 
says, 
especially 
after 
the 
“Enough” 


(several 
lines 
above), 
seems 
very 
close, 
to 
put 
it 
mildly, 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
position. 
Yet 
Nietzsche 
here 
dissociates 
himself 
from 
these 
remarks 
and 
ascribes 
them 
to 
a 
“pedant”—not 
because 
they 
are 
wrong 
but 
because 
he 
considers 
it 
pedantic 
and 
self-righteous 
to 
be 
so 
unhumorously 
and 
completely 
right.

When 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
this, 
the 
taste 
for 
archaic 
and 
primitive 
art 


was 
not 
yet 
widespread 
and 
classical 
art 
was 
still 
considered 
the 
norm: 
Praxiteles 
and 
Raphael 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
the 
ultimate 
in 
beauty. 
Nietzsche 
thus 
foresees 
developments 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century.

Untergang. 
Compare 
with 
this 
whole 
passage 
the 
Prologue 
of 
Zarathustra, 
especially 
sections 
3-6, 
where 
Nietzsche 
plays 
with 
the 
words 
Untergang, 
Übermensch 
(overman), 
and 
überwinden 
(overcome) 
and 
contrasts 
the 
overman 
with 
“the 
last 
man” 
who 
has 
“invented 
happiness” 
and 
is 
contemptible.

Redlichkeit.

“We 
strive 
for 
the 
forbidden.” 
The 
quotation 
is 
from 
Ovid’s 
Amores, 
III, 
4, 
17. 
11 
Cf. 
Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator 
(1874), 
section 
4: 
“… 
He 
will 
be 



mistaken 
for 
another 
and 
long 
be 
considered 
an 
ally 
of 
powers 
which 
he 
abominates.…” 
There, 
too, 
this 
is 
pictured 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
honesty 
and 
courage. 
But 
when 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Ecce 
Homo, 
in 
1888, 
he 
no 
longer 
felt: 
“what 
matter?” 
Thus 
the 
first 
section 
of 
the 
Preface 
ends: 
“Under 
these 
circumstances 
I 
have 
a 
duty 
against 
which 
my 
habits, 
even 
more 
the 
pride 
of 
my 
instincts, 
revolt 
at 
bottom—namely, 
to 
say: 
Hear 
me! 
For 
I 
am 
such 
and 
such 
a 
person. 
Above 
all, 
do 
not 
mistake 
me 
for 
someone 
else!” 
There 
is 
also 
a 
note 
of 
the 
period 
1885-88, 
published 
posthumously: 
“One 
generally 
mistakes 
me 
for 
someone 
else: 
I 
confess 
it; 
also 
that 
I 
should 
be 
done 
a 
great 
service 
if 
someone 
else 
were 
to 
defend 
and 
define 
me 
against 
these 
mistakes 
[V 
erwechselungen]”

Musarion 
editon, 
vol. 
XIV, 
318f.).

Claude 
Adrien 
Helvétius 
(1715-71) 
was 
a 
French 
philosopher 
whose

had 
borne 
the

of 
Schweitzer. 
He 
was 
a 
materialist 
and 
utilitarian.

“fashion.”

paragraph 
to 
which 
notes

speaks 
for 
itself. 
If 
anything 
redeems 
section 
232, 
and 
much 
of 
the 


remainder 
of

it 
is 
surely 
the 
disclaimer 
in

In 
the 
first 
two 
editions 
a 
new 
section 
begins 
at 
this 
point, 
but 
it 
is 
numbered 
237, 
repeating 
the 
preceding 
number. 
In 
the 
standard 
editions, 
including 
Schlechta’s 
(which 
falsely 
claims 
to 
follow 
the 
original 
edition), 
the 
second 
237 
is 
omitted, 
and 
the 
verse 
and 
prose 
are 
offered 
as 
a 
single 
section. 


31 
Fortunately 
for 
Nietzsche, 
this 
is 
surely 
wrong. 
But 
it 
is 
worth 
asking 
which, 
if 
any, 
of 
his 
other 
ideas 
are 
of 
a 
piece 
with 
his 
secondhand 
wisdom 
about 
“woman”: 
probably 
his 
embarrassingly 
frequent 
invocation 
of 
“severity” 
and 
“hardness” 
and 
other 
such 
terms— 
the 
almost 
ritual 
repetition 
of 
the 
words, 
not 
necessarily, 
if 
at 
all, 
the 
spiritualized 
conceptions 
he 
develops 
with 
their 
aid—and 
perhaps 
also 
the 
tenor 
of 
his 
remarks 
about 
democracy 
and 
parliaments. 
Goethe 
said: 
“The 
greatest 
human 
beings 
are 
always 
connected 
with 
their 
century 
by 
means 
of 
some 
weakness” 
(Elective 
Affinities). 
At 
these 
points 
Nietzsche’s 
deliberate 
“untimeliness” 
now 
seems 
time-bound, 
dated, 
and 
as 
shallow 
as 
what 
he 
attacked.

I 
heard 
once 
again 
for 
the 
first 
time—Richard 
Wagner’s 
overture 
to 
the 
Meistersinger:1 
it 
is 
magnificent, 
overcharged, 
heavy, 
late 
art 
that 
has 
the 
pride 
of 
presupposing 
two 
centuries 
of 
music 
as 
still 
living, 
if 
it 
is 
to 
be 
understood: 
it 
is 
to 
the 
credit 
of 
the 
Germans 
that 
such 
pride 
did 
not 
miscalculate. 
What 
flavors 
and 
forces, 
what 
seasons 
and 
climes 
are 
not 
mixed 
here! 
It 
strikes 
us 
now 
as 
archaic, 
now 
as 
strange, 
tart, 
and 
too 
young, 
it 
is 
just 
as 
capricious 
as 
it 
is 
pompous-traditional, 
it 
is 
not 
infrequently 
saucy, 
still 
more 
often 
coarse 
and 
rude—it 
has 
fire 
and 
courage 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
loose 
dun 
skin 
of 
fruit 
that 
ripens 
too 
late. 
It 
flows 
broad 
and 
full—and 
suddenly 
a 
moment 
of 
inexplicable 
hesitation, 
like 
a 
gap 
opening 
up 
between 
cause 
and 
effect, 
a 
pressure 
triggering 
dreams, 
almost 
nightmares—but 
already 
the 
old 
width 
and 
breadth 
are 
regained 
by 
the 
current 
of 
well-being, 
the 
most 
manifold 
well-being, 
of 
old 
and 
new 
happiness, 
very 
much 
including 
the 
artist’s 
happiness 
with 
himself 
which 
he 
has 
no 
wish 
to 
hide, 
his 
amazed, 
happy 
sharing 
of 
the 
knowledge 
that 
the 
means 
he 
has 
employed 
here 
are 
masterly—new 
artistic 
devices, 
newly 
acquired, 
not 
yet 
tested, 
as 
he 
seems 
to 
let 
us 
know. 


Altogether, 
no 
beauty, 
no 
south, 
nothing 
of 
southern 
and 
subtle 
brightness 
of 
the 
sky, 
nothing 
of 
gracefulness, 
no 
dance, 
scarcely 
any 
will 
to 
logic; 
even 
a 
certain 
clumsiness 
that 
is 
actually 
stressed, 
as 
if 
the 
artist 
wished 
to 
say 
to 
us, 
“that 
is 
part 
of 
my 
intention”; 
cumbersome 
drapery, 
something 
capricious, 
barbarian, 
and 
solemn, 
a 
flurry 
of 
erudite 
preciousness 
and 
lace; 
something 
German 
in 
the 
best 
and 
worst 
senses 
of 
the 
word, 
something 
manifold, 
formless, 
and 
inexhaustible 
in 
a 
German 
way; 
a 
certain 
German 
powerfulness 
and 
overfulness 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
is 
not 
afraid 
of 
hiding 
behind 
the 
refinements 
of 
decay—which 
perhaps 
really 
feels 
most 
at 
home 
there; 
a 
truly 
genuine 
token 
of 
the 
German 
soul 
which 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
young 
and 
superannuated, 
overly 
mellow 
and 
still 
overrich 
in 
future. 
This 
kind 
of 
music 
expresses 
best 
what 
I 
think 
of 
the 
Germans: 
they 
belong 
to 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday 
and 
the 
day 
after 
tomorrow—as 
yet 
they 
have 
no 
today. 



241 


We 
“good 
Europeans”—we, 
too, 
know 
hours 
when 
we 
permit 
ourselves 
some 
hearty 
fatherlandishness, 
a 
plop 
and 
relapse 
into 
old 
loves 
and 
narrownesses—I 
have 
just 
given 
a 
sample 
of 
that—hours 
of 
national 
agitations, 
patriotic 
palpitations, 
and 
various 
other 
sorts 
of 
archaizing 
sentimental 
inundations. 
More 
ponderous 
spirits 
than 
we 
are 
may 
require 
more 
time 
to 
get 
over 
what 
with 
us 
takes 
only 
hours 
and 
in 
a 
few 
hours 
has 
run 
its 
course: 
some 
require 
half 
a 
year, 
others 
half 
a 
life, 
depending 
on 
the 
speed 
and 
power 
of 
their 
digestion 
and 
metabolism. 
Indeed, 
I 
could 
imagine 
dull2 
and 
sluggish 
races 
who 
would 
require 
half 
a 
century 
even 
in 
our 
rapidly 
moving 
Europe 
to 
overcome 
such 
atavistic 
attacks 
of 
fatherlandishness 
and 
soil 
addiction 
and 
to 
return 
to 
reason, 
meaning 
“good 
Europeanism.” 


As 
I 
am 
digressing 
to 
this 
possibility, 
it 
so 
happens 
that 
I 
become 
an 
ear-
witness 
of 
a 
conversation 
between 
two 
old 
“patriots”: 
apparently 
both 
were 
hard 
of 
hearing 
and 
therefore 
spoke 
that 
much 
louder. 


“He 
thinks 
and 
knows 
as 
much 
of 
philosophy 
as 
a 
peasant 
or 
a 
fraternity 
student,” 
said 
one; 
“he 
is 
still 
innocent. 
But 
what 
does 
it 
matter 
today? 
This 
is 
the 
age 
of 
the 
masses: 
they 
grovel 
on 
their 
bellies 
before 
anything 
massive. 
In 
politicis, 
too. 
A 
statesman 
who 
piles 
up 
for 
them 
another 
tower 
of 
Babel, 
a 
monster 
of 
empire 
and 
power, 
they 
call 
‘great’; 
what 
does 
it 
matter 
that 
we, 
more 
cautious 
and 
reserved, 
do 
not 
yet 
abandon 
the 
old 
faith 
that 
only 
a 
great 
thought 
can 
give 
a 
deed 
or 
cause 
greatness. 
Suppose 
a 
statesman 
put 
his 
people 
in 
a 
position 
requiring 
them 
to 
go 
in 
for 
‘great 
politics’ 
from 
now 
on, 
though 
they 
were 
ill-disposed 
for 
that 
by 
nature 
and 
ill 
prepared 
as 
well, 
so 
that 
they 
would 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
sacrifice 
their 
old 
and 
secure 
virtues 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
a 
novel 
and 
dubious 
mediocrity—suppose 
a 
statesman 
actually 
condemned 
his 
people 
to 
‘politicking’ 
although 
so 
far 
they 
had 
had 
better 
things 
to 
do 
and 
think 
about, 
and 
deep 
down 
in 
their 
souls 
they 
had 
not 
got 
rid 
of 
a 
cautious 
disgust 
with 
the 
restlessness, 
emptiness, 
and 
noisy 
quarrelsomeness 
of 
peoples 
that 
really 
go 
in 
for 
politicking—suppose 
such 
a 
statesman 
goaded 
the 
slumbering 
passions 
and 
lusts 
of 
his 
people, 
turning 
their 
diffidence 
and 
delight 
in 
standing 
aside 
into 
a 
blot, 
their 



cosmopolitanism 
and 
secret 
infinity 
into 
a 
serious 
wrong, 
devaluating 
their 
most 
cordial 
inclinations, 
inverting 
their 
conscience, 
making 
their 
spirit 
narrow, 
their 
taste 
‘national’— 
what! 
a 
statesman 
who 
did 
all 
this, 
for 
whom 
his 
people 
would 
have 
to 
atone 
for 
all 
future 
time, 
if 
they 
have 
any 
future, 
such 
a 
statesman 
should 
be 
great?” 


“Without 
a 
doubt!” 
the 
other 
patriot 
replied 
vehemently; 
“otherwise 
he 
would 
not 
have 
been 
able 
to 
do 
it. 
Perhaps 
it 
was 
insane 
to 
want 
such 
a 
thing? 
But 
perhaps 
everything 
great 
was 
merely 
insane 
when 
it 
started.” 


“An 
abuse 
of 
words!” 
his 
partner 
shouted 
back; 
“strong! 
strong! 
strong 
and 
insane! 
Not 
great!” 


The 
old 
men 
had 
obviously 
become 
heated 
as 
they 
thus 
flung 
their 
truths 
into 
each 
other’s 
faces; 
but 
I, 
in 
my 
happiness 
and 
beyond, 
considered 
how 
soon 
one 
stronger 
will 
become 
master 
over 
the 
strong; 
also 
that 
for 
the 
spiritual 
flattening3 
of 
a 
people 
there 
is 
a 
compensation, 
namely 
the 
deepening 
of 
another 
people.

Call 
that 
in 
which 
the 
distinction 
of 
the 
European 
is 
sought 
“civilization” 
or 
“humanization” 
or 
“progress,” 
or 
call 
it 
simply—without 
praise 
or 
blame 
—using 
a 
political 
formula, 
Europe’s 
democratic 
movement: 
behind 
all 
the 
moral 
and 
political 
foregrounds 
to 
which 
such 
formulas 
point, 
a 
tremendous 
physiological 
process 
is 
taking 
place 
and 
gaining 
momentum. 
The 
Europeans 
are 
becoming 
more 
similar 
to 
each 
other; 
they 
become 
more 
and 
more 
detached 
from 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
races 
originate 
that 
are 
tied 
to 
some 
climate 
or 
class; 
they 
become 
increasingly 
independent 
of 
any 
determinate 
milieu 
that 
would 
like 
to 
inscribe 
itself 
for 
centuries 
in 
body 
and 
soul 
with 
the 
same 
demands. 
Thus 
an 
essentially 
supra-national 
and 
nomadic 
type 
of 
man 
is 
gradually 
coming 
up, 
a 
type 
that 
possesses, 
physiologically 
speaking, 
a 
maximum 
of 
the 
art 
and 
power 
of 
adaptation 
as 
its 
typical 
distinction. 


The 
tempo 
of 
this 
process 
of 
the 
“evolving 
European” 
may 
be 
retarded 
by 
great 
relapses, 
but 
perhaps 
it 
will 
gain 
in 
vehemence 
and 
profundity 
and 
grow 
just 
on 
their 
account: 
the 
still 
raging 
storm 
and 
stress 
of 
“national 
feeling” 
belongs 
here, 
also 
that 
anarchism 
which 
is 
just 
now 
coming 
up. 
But 
this 
process 
will 
probably 
lead 
to 
results 
which 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
least 
expected 
by 
those 
who 
naïvely 
promote 
and 
praise 
it, 
the 
apostles 
of 
“modern 
ideas.” 
The 
very 
same 
new 
conditions 
that 
will 
on 
the 
average 
lead 
to 
the 
leveling 
and 
mediocritization 
of 
man—to 
a 
useful, 
industrious, 
handy, 
multi-purpose 
herd 
animal—are 
likely 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
to 
give 
birth 
to 
exceptional 
human 
beings 
of 
the 
most 
dangerous 
and 
attractive 
quality. 


To 
be 
sure, 
that 
power 
of 
adaptation 
which 
keeps 
trying 
out 
changing 
conditions 
and 
begins 
some 
new 
work 
with 
every 
generation, 
almost 
with 
every 
decade, 
does 
not 
make 
possible 
the 
powerfulness 
of 
the 
type, 
and 
the 
over-all 
impression 
of 
such 
future 
Europeans 
will 
probably 
be 
that 
of 
manifold 
garrulous 
workers 
who 
will 
be 
poor 
in 
will, 
extremely 
employable, 
and 
as 
much 
in 
need 
of 
a 
master 
and 
commander 
as 
of 
their 
daily 
bread. 
But 
while 
the 
democratization 
of 
Europe 
leads 
to 
the 
production 
of 
a 
type 
that 
is 
prepared 
for 
slavery 
in 
the 
subtlest 
sense, 
in 
single, 
exceptional 
cases 
the 
strong 
human 
being 
will 
have 
to 
turn 
out 
stronger 
and 
richer 
than 
perhaps 



ever 
before—thanks 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
prejudice 
from 
his 
training, 
thanks 
to 
the 
tremendous 
manifoldness 
of 
practice, 
art, 
and 
mask. 
I 
meant 
to 
say: 
the 
democratization 
of 
Europe 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
involuntary 
arrangement 
for 
the 
cultivation 
of 
tyrants—taking 
that 
word 
in 
every 
sense, 
including 
the 
most 
spiritual. 



243 


I 
hear 
with 
pleasure 
that 
our 
sun 
is 
swiftly 
moving 
toward 
the 
constellation 
of 
Hercules—and 
I 
hope 
that 
man 
on 
this 
earth 
will 
in 
this 
respect 
follow 
the 
sun’s 
example? 
And 
we 
first 
of 
all, 
we 
good 
Europeans!— 



244 


There 
was 
a 
time 
when 
it 
was 
customary 
to 
attribute 
“profundity” 
to 
the 
Germans, 
as 
a 
distinction. 
Now 
that 
the 
most 
successful 
type 
of 
the 
new 
Germanism 
lusts 
after 
utterly 
different 
honors 
and 
perhaps 
misses 
“pluck” 
in 
everything 
profound, 
some 
doubt 
may 
almost 
be 
timely 
and 
patriotic 
as 
to 
whether 
that 
former 
praise 
was 
not 
based 
on 
self-deception—in 
short, 
whether 
German 
profundity 
is 
not 
at 
bottom 
something 
different 
and 
worse, 
and 
something 
that, 
thank 
God, 
one 
is 
about 
to 
shake 
off 
successfully. 
Let 
us 
make 
the 
attempt 
to 
relearn 
about 
German 
profundity: 
nothing 
more 
is 
needed 
for 
this 
than 
a 
little 
vivisection 
of 
the 
German 
soul. 


The 
German 
soul 
is 
above 
all 
manifold, 
of 
diverse 
origins, 
more 
put 
together 
and 
superimposed 
than 
actually 
built: 
that 
is 
due 
to 
where 
it 
comes 
from. 
A 
German 
who 
would 
make 
bold 
to 
say, 
“two 
souls, 
alas, 
are 
dwelling 
in 
my 
breast,”4 
would 
violate 
the 
truth 
rather 
grossly 
or, 
more 
precisely, 
would 
fall 
short 
of 
the 
truth 
by 
a 
good 
many 
souls. 
As 
a 
people 
of 
the 
most 
monstrous 
mixture 
and 
medley 
of 
races, 
perhaps 
even 
with 
a 
preponderance 
of 
the 
pre-Aryan 
element, 
as 
“people 
of 
the 
middle” 
in 
every 
sense, 
the 
Germans 
are 
more 
incomprehensible, 
comprehensive, 
contradictory, 
unknown, 
incalculable, 
surprising, 
even 
frightening 
than 
other 
people 
are 
to 
themselves: 
they 
elude 
definition 
and 
would 
be 
on 
that 
account 
alone 
the 
despair 
of 
the 
French. 


It 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
Germans 
that 
the 
question, 
“what 
is 
German?” 
never 
dies 
out 
among 
them. 
Kotzebue 
surely 
knew 
his 
Germans 
well 
enough: 
“we 
have 
been 
recognized!” 
they 
jubilated—but 
Sand, 
too, 
thought 
he 
knew 
them.5 
Jean 
Paul6 
knew 
what 
he 
was 
doing 
when 
he 
declared 
himself 
wrathfully 
against 
Fichte’s 
mendacious 
but 
patriotic 
flatteries 
and 
exaggerations—but 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
Goethe 
did 
not 
think 
about 
the 
Germans 
as 
Jean 
Paul 
did, 
although 
he 
considered 
him 
right 
about 
Fichte. 
What 
did 
Goethe 
really 
think 
about 
the 
Germans? 


But 
there 
were 
many 
things 
around 
him 
about 
which 
he 
never 
spoke 
clearly, 
and 
his 
life 
long 
he 
was 
a 
master 
of 
subtle 
silence—he 
probably 
had 
good 
reasons 
for 
that. 
What 
is 
certain 
is 
that 
it 
was 
not 
“the 
Wars 
of 



Liberation”7 
that 
made 
him 
look 
up 
more 
cheerfully, 
any 
more 
than 
the 
French 
Revolution; 
the 
event 
on 
whose 
account 
he 
rethought 
his 
Faust, 
indeed 
the 
whole 
problem 
of 
man, 
was 
the 
appearance 
of 
Napoleon. 
There 
are 
words 
of 
Goethe 
in 
which 
he 
deprecates 
with 
impatient 
hardness, 
as 
if 
he 
belonged 
to 
a 
foreign 
country, 
what 
the 
Germans 
take 
pride 
in: 
the 
celebrated 
German 
Gemüt8 
he 
once 
defined 
as 
“indulgence 
toward 
the 
weaknesses 
of 
others 
as 
well 
as 
one’s 
own.” 
Was 
he 
wrong 
in 
that? 
It 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
Germans 
that 
one 
is 
rarely 
completely 
wrong 
about 
them. 


The 
German 
soul 
has 
its 
passageways 
and 
inter-passageways; 
there 
are 
caves, 
hideouts, 
and 
dungeons 
in 
it; 
its 
disorder 
has 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
the 
attraction 
of 
the 
mysterious; 
the 
German 
is 
an 
expert 
on 
secret 
paths 
to 
chaos. 
And 
just 
as 
everything 
loves 
its 
simile, 
the 
German 
loves 
clouds 
and 
everything 
that 
is 
unclear, 
becoming, 
twilit, 
damp, 
and 
overcast: 
whatever 
is 
in 
any 
way 
uncertain, 
unformed, 
blurred, 
growing, 
he 
feels 
to 
be 
“profound.” 
The 
German 
himself 
is 
not, 
he 
becomes, 
he 
“develops.” 
“Development” 
is 
therefore 
the 
truly 
German 
find 
and 
hit 
in 
the 
great 
realm 
of 
philosophical 
formulas—a 
governing 
concept 
that, 
united 
with 
German 
beer 
and 
German 
music, 
is 
at 
work 
trying 
to 
Germanize 
the 
whole 
of 
Europe. 


Foreigners 
stand 
amazed 
and 
fascinated 
before 
the 
riddles 
posed 
for 
them 
by 
the 
contradictory 
nature 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
German 
soul 
(brought 
into 
a 
system 
by 
Hegel 
and 
finally 
set 
to 
music 
by 
Richard 
Wagner). 
“Good-natured 
and 
vicious”—such 
a 
conjunction, 
preposterous 
in 
relation 
to 
any 
other 
people, 
is 
unfortunately 
justified 
all 
too 
often 
in 
Germany: 
let 
anyone 
live 
for 
a 
while 
among 
Swabians! 
The 
ponderousness 
of 
the 
German 
scholar, 
his 
social 
bad 
taste, 
gets 
along 
alarmingly 
well 
with 
an 
inner 
rope-dancing 
and 
easy 
boldness 
which 
has 
taught 
all 
the 
gods 
what 
fear 
is. 
Whoever 
wants 
a 
demonstration 
of 
the 
“German 
soul” 
ad 
oculos9 
should 
merely 
look 
into 
German 
taste, 
into 
German 
arts 
and 
customs: 
What 
boorish 
indifference 
to 
“taste”! 
How 
the 
noblest 
stands 
right 
next 
to 
the 
meanest! 
How 
disorderly 
and 
rich 
this 
whole 
psychic 
household 
is! 
The 
German 
drags 
his 
soul 
along: 
whatever 
he 
experiences 
he 
drags. 
He 
digests 
his 
events 
badly, 
he 
never 
gets 
“done” 
with 
them; 
German 
profundity 
is 
often 
merely 
a 
hard 
and 
sluggish 
“digestion.” 
And 
just 
as 
all 
chronic 
invalids, 
all 
dyspeptics, 
love 
comfort, 
Germans 
love 
“openness” 
and 
“Biederkeit”: 
how 
comfortable 
it 
is 
to 
be 
open 
and 
“bieder”!10 
Perhaps 
the 
German 
of 
today 
knows 
no 
more 
dangerous 
and 
successful 
disguise 
than 
this 
confiding, 
accommodating, 
cards-on-the-table 
manner 
of 
German 
honesty: 
this 
is 
his 
true 
Mephistophelesart; 
with 
that 
he 



can 
“still 
go 
far.” 
The 
German 
lets 
himself 
go 
while 
making 
faithful 
blue, 
empty, 
German 
eyes—and 
immediately 
foreigners 
confound 
him 
with 
his 
dressing 
gown. 


I 
meant 
to 
say: 
whatever 
“German 
profundity” 
may 
be—when 
we 
are 
entirely 
among 
ourselves, 
perhaps 
we 
permit 
ourselves 
to 
laugh 
at 
it?—we 
shall 
do 
well 
to 
hold 
its 
semblance 
and 
good 
name 
in 
honor 
in 
the 
future, 
too, 
and 
not 
to 
trade 
our 
old 
reputation 
as 
a 
people 
of 
profundity 
too 
cheaply 
for 
Prussian 
“pluck” 
and 
Berlin 
wit 
and 
sand.11 
It 
is 
clever 
for 
a 
people 
to 
make 
and 
let 
itself 
be 
considered 
profound, 
awkward, 
good-natured, 
honest, 
and 
not 
clever: 
it 
might 
even 
be—profound. 
Finally, 
one 
should 
live 
up 
to 
one’s 
name: 
it 
is 
not 
for 
nothing 
that 
one 
is 
called 
the 
“tiusche” 
Volk, 
the 
Täusche-
Volk, 
deceiver 
people.12— 



245 


The 
“good 
old 
time” 
is 
gone, 
in 
Mozart 
we 
hear 
its 
swan 
song. 
How 
fortunate 
we 
are 
that 
his 
rococo 
still 
speaks 
to 
us, 
that 
his 
“good 
company,” 
his 
tender 
enthusiasms, 
his 
childlike 
delight 
in 
curlicues 
and 
Chinese 
touches, 
his 
courtesy 
of 
the 
heart, 
his 
longing 
for 
the 
graceful, 
those 
in 
love, 
those 
dancing, 
those 
easily 
moved 
to 
tears, 
his 
faith 
in 
the 
south, 
may 
still 
appeal 
to 
some 
residue 
in 
us. 
Alas, 
some 
day 
all 
this 
will 
be 
gone—but 
who 
may 
doubt 
that 
the 
understanding 
and 
taste 
for 
Beethoven 
will 
go 
long 
before 
that! 
Beethoven 
was 
after 
all 
merely 
the 
final 
chord 
of 
transition 
in 
style, 
a 
style 
break, 
and 
not, 
like 
Mozart, 
the 
last 
chord 
of 
a 
centuries-old 
great 
European 
taste. 


Beethoven 
is 
the 
interlude 
of 
a 
mellow 
old 
soul 
that 
constantly 
breaks 
and 
an 
over-young 
future 
soul 
that 
constantly 
comes; 
on 
his 
music 
lies 
that 
twilight 
of 
eternal 
losing 
and 
eternal 
extravagant 
hoping—the 
same 
light 
in 
which 
Europe 
was 
bathed 
when 
it 
dreamed 
with 
Rousseau, 
danced 
around 
the 
freedom 
tree 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
and 
finally 
almost 
worshiped 
before 
Napoleon. 
But 
how 
quickly 
this 
feeling 
pales 
now; 
how 
difficult 
is 
mere 
knowledge 
of 
this 
feeling 
even 
today—how 
strange 
to 
our 
ears 
sounds 
the 
language 
of 
Rousseau, 
Schiller, 
Shelley, 
Byron, 
in 
whom, 
taken 
together, 
the 
same 
fate 
of 
Europe 
found 
its 
way 
into 
words 
that 
in 
Beethoven 
knew 
how 
to 
sing! 


Whatever 
German 
music 
came 
after 
that 
belongs 
to 
romanticism, 
a 
movement 
that 
was, 
viewed 
historically, 
still 
briefer, 
still 
more 
fleeting, 
still 
more 
superficial 
than 
that 
great 
entr’acte, 
that 
transition 
of 
Europe 
from 
Rousseau 
to 
Napoleon 
and 
to 
the 
rise 
of 
democracy. 
Weber: 
but 
what 
are 
Freischütz 
and 
Oberon 
to 
us 
today! 
Or 
Marschner’s 
Hans 
Heiling 
and 
Vampyr! 
Or 
even 
Wagner’s 
Tannhäuser. 
That 
is 
music 
that 
has 
died 
away 
though 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
forgotten. 
All 
this 
music 
of 
romanticism, 
moreover, 
was 
not 
noble 
enough 
to 
remain 
valid 
anywhere 
except 
in 
the 
theater 
and 
before 
crowds; 
it 
was 
from 
the 
start 
second-rate 
music 
that 
was 
not 
considered 
seriously 
by 
genuine 
musicians. 


It 
is 
different 
with 
Felix 
Mendelssohn, 
that 
halcyon 
master 
who, 
on 
account 
of 
his 
lighter, 
purer, 
more 
enchanted 
soul, 
was 
honored 
quickly 
and 



just 
as 
quickly 
forgotten: 
as 
the 
beautiful 
intermezzo 
of 
German 
music. 
But 
as 
for 
Robert 
Schumann, 
who 
was 
very 
serious 
and 
also 
was 
taken 
seriously 
from 
the 
start—he 
was 
the 
last 
to 
found 
a 
school—is 
it 
not 
considered 
a 
good 
fortune 
among 
us 
today, 
a 
relief, 
a 
liberation, 
that 
this 
Schumann 
romanticism 
has 
been 
overcome? 


Schumann, 
fleeing 
into 
the 
“Saxon 
Switzerland”13 
of 
his 
soul, 
half 
like 
Werther, 
half 
like 
Jean 
Paul, 
certainly 
not 
like 
Beethoven, 
certainly 
not 
like 
Byron—his 
Manfred 
music 
is 
a 
mistake 
and 
misunderstanding 
to 
the 
point 
of 
an 
injustice—Schumann 
with 
his 
taste 
which 
was 
basically 
a 
small 
taste 
(namely, 
a 
dangerous 
propensity, 
doubly 
dangerous 
among 
Germans, 
for 
quiet 
lyricism 
and 
sottishness 
of 
feeling), 
constantly 
walking 
off 
to 
withdraw 
shyly 
and 
retire, 
a 
noble 
tender-heart 
who 
wallowed 
in 
all 
sorts 
of 
anonymous 
bliss 
and 
woe, 
a 
kind 
of 
girl 
and 
noli 
me 
tangere14 
from 
the 
start: 
this 
Schumann 
was 
already 
a 
merely 
German 
event 
in 
music, 
no 
longer 
a 
European 
one, 
as 
Beethoven 
was 
and, 
to 
a 
still 
greater 
extent, 
Mozart. 
With 
him 
German 
music 
was 
threatened 
by 
its 
greatest 
danger: 
losing 
the 
voice 
for 
the 
soul 
of 
Europe 
and 
descending 
to 
mere 
fatherlandishness.

What 
torture 
books 
written 
in 
German 
are 
for 
anyone 
who 
has 
a 
third 
ear! 
How 
vexed 
one 
stands 
before 
the 
slowly 
revolving 
swamp 
of 
sounds 
that 
do 
not 
sound 
like 
anything 
and 
rhythms 
that 
do 
not 
dance, 
called 
a 
“book” 
among 
Germans! 
Yet 
worse 
is 
the 
German 
who 
reads 
books! 
How 
lazily, 
how 
reluctantly, 
how 
badly 
he 
reads! 
How 
many 
Germans 
know, 
and 
demand 
of 
themselves 
that 
they 
should 
know, 
that 
there 
is 
art 
in 
every 
good 
sentence 
—art 
that 
must 
be 
figured 
out 
if 
the 
sentence 
is 
to 
be 
understood! 
A 
misunderstanding 
about 
its 
tempo, 
for 
example—and 
the 
sentence 
itself 
is 
misunderstood. 


That 
one 
must 
not 
be 
in 
doubt 
about 
the 
rhythmically 
decisive 
syllables, 
that 
one 
experiences 
the 
break 
with 
any 
excessively 
severe 
symmetry 
as 
deliberate 
and 
attractive, 
that 
one 
lends 
a 
subtle 
and 
patient 
ear 
to 
every 


16 


staccato15 
and 
every 
rubato, 
that 
one 
figures 
out 
the 
meaning 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
vowels 
and 
diphthongs 
and 
how 
delicately 
and 
richly 
they 
can 
be 
colored 
and 
change 
colors 
as 
they 
follow 
each 
other—who 
among 
book-
reading 
Germans 
has 
enough 
good 
will 
to 
acknowledge 
such 
duties 
and 
demands 
and 
to 
listen 
to 
that 
much 
art 
and 
purpose 
in 
language? 
In 
the 
end 
one 
simply 
does 
not 
have 
“the 
ear 
for 
that”; 
and 
thus 
the 
strongest 
contrasts 
of 
style 
go 
unheard, 
and 
the 
subtlest 
artistry 
is 
wasted 
as 
on 
the 
deaf. 


These 
were 
my 
thoughts 
when 
I 
noticed 
how 
clumsily 
and 
un-discerningly 
two 
masters 
in 
the 
art 
of 
prose 
were 
confounded—one 
whose 
words 
drop 
hesitantly 
and 
coldly, 
as 
from 
the 
ceiling 
of 
a 
damp 
cave—he 
counts 
on 
their 
dull 
sound 
and 
resonance—and 
another 
who 
handles 
his 
language 
like 
a 
flexible 
rapier, 
feeling 
from 
his 
arm 
down 
to 
his 
toes 
the 
dangerous 
delight 
of 
the 
quivering, 
over-sharp 
blade 
that 
desires 
to 
bite, 
hiss, 
cut.17—

How 
little 
German 
style 
has 
to 
do 
with 
sound 
and 
the 
ears 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
precisely 
our 
good 
musicians 
write 
badly. 
The 
German 
does 
not 
read 
aloud, 
not 
for 
the 
ear 
but 
only 
with 
the 
eye: 
meanwhile 
his 
ears 
are 
put 
away 
in 
a 
drawer. 
In 
antiquity 
men 
read—when 
they 
did 
read, 
which 
happened 
rarely 
enough—to 
themselves, 
aloud, 
with 
a 
resounding 
voice; 
one 
was 
surprised 
when 
anyone 
read 
quietly, 
and 
secretly 
asked 
oneself 
for 
the 
reasons. 
With 
a 
resounding 
voice: 
that 
means, 
with 
all 
the 
crescendos, 
inflections, 
and 
reversals 
of 
tone 
and 
changes 
in 
tempo 
in 
which 
the 
ancient 
public 
world 
took 
delight. 


The 
laws 
of 
written 
style 
were 
then 
the 
same 
as 
those 
for 
spoken 
style; 
and 
these 
laws 
depended 
partly 
on 
the 
amazing 
development 
and 
the 
refined 
requirements 
of 
ear 
and 
larynx, 
partly 
on 
the 
strength, 
perseverance, 
and 
power 
of 
ancient 
lungs. 
A 
period 
in 
the 
classical 
sense 
is 
above 
all 
a 
physiological 
unit, 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
held 
together 
by 
a 
single 
breath. 
Such 
periods 
as 
are 
found 
in 
Demosthenes 
and 
Cicero, 
swelling 
twice 
and 
coming 
down 
twice, 
all 
within 
a 
single 
breath, 
are 
delights 
for 
the 
men 
of 
antiquity 
who, 
from 
their 
own 
training, 
knew 
how 
to 
esteem 
their 
virtue 
and 
how 
rare 
and 
difficult 
was 
the 
delivery 
of 
such 
a 
period. 
We 
really 
have 
no 
right 
to 
the 
great 
period, 
we 
who 
are 
modern 
and 
in 
every 
sense 
short 
of 
breath.19 


All 
of 
these 
ancients 
were 
after 
all 
themselves 
dilettantes 
in 
rhetoric, 
hence 
connoisseurs, 
hence 
critics 
and 
thus 
drove 
their 
rhetoricians 
to 
extremes; 
just 
as 
in 
the 
last 
century, 
when 
all 
Italians 
and 
Italiennes 
knew 
how 
to 
sing, 
virtuosity 
in 
singing 
(and 
with 
that 
also 
the 
art 
of 
melody) 
reached 
its 
climax 
among 
them. 
In 
Germany, 
however, 
there 
really 
was 
(until 
quite 
recently, 
when 
a 
kind 
of 
platform 
eloquence 
began 
shyly 
and 
clumsily 
enough 
to 
flap 
its 
young 
wings) 
only 
a 
single 
species 
of 
public 
and 
roughly 
artful 
rhetoric: 
that 
from 
the 
pulpit. 


In 
Germany 
the 
preacher 
alone 
knew 
what 
a 
syllable 
weighs, 
or 
a 
word, 
and 
how 
a 
sentence 
strikes, 
leaps, 
plunges, 
runs, 
runs 
out; 
he 
alone 
had 
a 
conscience 
in 
his 
ears, 
often 
enough 
a 
bad 
conscience; 
for 
there 
is 
no 
lack 
of 
reasons 
why 
Germans 
rarely 
attain 
proficiency 
in 
rhetoric, 
and 
almost 
always 



too 
late. 
The 
masterpiece 
of 
German 
prose 
is 
therefore, 
fairly 
enough, 
the 
masterpiece 
of 
its 
greatest 
preacher: 
the 
Bible 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
best 
German 
book. 
Compared 
with 
Luther’s 
Bible, 
almost 
everything 
else 
is 
mere 
“literature”—something 
that 
did 
not 
grow 
in 
Germany 
and 
therefore 
also 
did 
not 
grow 
and 
does 
not 
grow 
into 
German 
hearts—as 
the 
Bible 
did. 



248 


There 
are 
two 
types 
of 
genius: 
one 
which 
above 
all 
begets 
and 
wants 
to 
beget, 
and 
another 
which 
prefers 
being 
fertilized 
and 
giving 
birth. 
Just 
so, 
there 
are 
among 
peoples 
of 
genius 
those 
to 
whom 
the 
woman’s 
problem 
of 
pregnancy 
and 
the 
secret 
task 
of 
forming, 
maturing, 
and 
perfecting 
has 
been 
allotted—the 
Greeks, 
for 
example, 
were 
a 
people 
of 
this 
type; 
also 
the 
French 
—and 
others 
who 
must 
fertilize 
and 
become 
the 
causes 
of 
new 
orders 
of 
life 
—like 
the 
Jews,20 
the 
Romans, 
and, 
asking 
this 
in 
all 
modesty, 
the 
Germans? 
Peoples, 
tormented 
and 
enchanted 
by 
unknown 
fevers 
and 
irresistibly 
pressed 
beyond 
themselves, 
in 
love 
and 
lusting 
after 
foreign 
races 
(after 
those 
who 
like 
“being 
fertilized”), 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
domineering 
like 
all 
that 
knows 
itself 
to 
be 
full 
of 
creative 
powers 
and 
hence 
“by 
the 
grace 
of 
God.” 
These 
two 
types 
of 
genius 
seek 
each 
other, 
like 
man 
and 
woman; 
but 
they 
also 
misunderstand 
each 
other—like 
man 
and 
woman. 



249 


Every 
people 
has 
its 
own 
Tartuffery 
and 
calls 
it 
its 
virtues.— 
What 
is 
best 
in 
us 
we 
do 
not 
know—we 
cannot 
know. 



250 


What 
Europe 
owes 
to 
the 
Jews? 
Many 
things, 
good 
and 
bad, 
and 
above 
all 
one 
thing 
that 
is 
both 
of 
the 
best 
and 
of 
the 
worst: 
the 
grand 
style 
in 
morality, 
the 
terribleness 
and 
majesty 
of 
infinite 
demands, 
infinite 
meanings, 
the 
whole 
romanticism 
and 
sublimity 
of 
moral 
questionabilities—and 
hence 
precisely 
the 
most 
attractive, 
captious, 
and 
choicest 
part 
of 
those 
plays 
of 
color 
and 
seductions 
to 
life 
in 
whose 
afterglow 
the 
sky 
of 
our 
European 
culture, 
its 
evening 
sky, 
is 
burning 
now—perhaps 
burning 
itself 
out. 
We 
artists 
among 
the 
spectators 
and 
philosophers 
are—grateful 
for 
this 
to 
the 
Jews.21 



251 


It 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
the 
bargain 
if 
all 
sorts 
of 
clouds 
and 
disturbances—in 
brief, 
little 
attacks 
of 
hebetation—pass 
over 
the 
spirit 
of 
a 
people 
that 
is 
suffering, 
and 
wants 
to 
suffer, 
of 
nationalistic 
nerve 
fever 
and 
political 
ambition. 
Examples 
among 
the 
Germans 
today 
include 
now 
the 
anti-French 
stupidity, 
now 
the 
anti-Jewish, 
now 
the 
anti-Polish, 
now 
the 
Christian-
romantic, 
now 
the 
Wagnerian, 
now 
the 
Teutonic, 
now 
the 
Prussian 
(just 
look 
at 
the 
wretched 
historians, 
these 
Sybels 
and 
Treitschkes22 
and 
their 
thickly 
bandaged 
heads!) 
and 
whatever 
other 
names 
these 
little 
mistifications23 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
and 
conscience 
may 
have. 
Forgive 
me, 
for 
during 
a 
brief 
daring 
sojourn 
in 
very 
infected 
territory 
I, 
too, 
did 
not 
altogether 
escape 
this 
disease 
and 
began 
like 
everyone 
else 
to 
develop 
notions 
about 
matters 
that 
are 
none 
of 
my 
business: 
the 
first 
sign 
of 
the 
political 
infection. 
For 
example 
about 
the 
Jews: 
only 
listen! 


I 
have 
not 
met 
a 
German 
yet 
who 
was 
well 
disposed 
toward 
the 
Jews; 
and 
however 
unconditionally 
all 
the 
cautious 
and 
politically-minded 
repudiated 
real 
anti-Semitism,24 
even 
this 
caution 
and 
policy 
are 
not 
directed 
against 
the 
species 
of 
this 
feeling 
itself 
but 
only 
against 
its 
dangerous 
immoderation, 
especially 
against 
the 
insipid 
and 
shameful 
expression 
of 
this 
immoderate 
feeling—about 
this, 
one 
should 
not 
deceive 
oneself. 
That 
Germany 
has 
amply 
enough 
Jews, 
that 
the 
German 
stomach, 
the 
German 
blood 
has 
trouble 
(and 
will 
still 
have 
trouble 
for 
a 
long 
time) 
digesting 
even 
this 
quantum 
of 
“Jew”—as 
the 
Italians, 
French, 
and 
English 
have 
done, 
having 
a 
stronger 
digestive 
system—that 
is 
the 
clear 
testimony 
and 
language 
of 
a 
general 
instinct 
to 
which 
one 
must 
listen, 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
one 
must 
act. 
“Admit 
no 
more 
new 
Jews! 
And 
especially 
close 
the 
doors 
to 
the 
east 
(also 
to 
Austria)!” 
thus 
commands 
the 
instinct 
of 
a 
people 
whose 
type 
is 
still 
weak 
and 
indefinite, 
so 
it 
could 
easily 
be 
blurred 
or 
extinguished 
by 
a 
stronger 
race. 
The 
Jews, 
however, 
are 
beyond 
any 
doubt 
the 
strongest, 
toughest, 
and 
purest 
race 
now 
living 
in 
Europe; 
they 
know 
how 
to 
prevail 
even 
under 
the 
worst 
conditions 
(even 
better 
than 
under 
favorable 
conditions), 
by 
means 
of 
virtues 
that 
today 
one 
would 
like 
to 
mark 
as 
vices—thanks 
above 
all 
to 
a 
resolute 



faith 
that 
need 
not 
be 
ashamed 
before 
“modern 
ideas”; 
they 
change, 
when 
they 
change, 
always 
only 
as 
the 
Russian 
Empire 
makes 
its 
conquests—being 
an 
empire 
that 
has 
time 
and 
is 
not 
of 
yesterday—namely, 
according 
to 
the 
principle, 
“as 
slowly 
as 
possible.” 


A 
thinker 
who 
has 
the 
development 
of 
Europe 
on 
his 
conscience 
will, 
in 
all 
his 
projects 
for 
this 
future, 
take 
into 
account 
the 
Jews 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Russians 
as 
the 
provisionally 
surest 
and 
most 
probable 
factors 
in 
the 
great 
play 
and 
fight 
of 
forces. 
What 
is 
called 
a 
“nation” 
in 
Europe 
today, 
and 
is 
really 
rather 
a 
res 
facta 
than 
a 
res 
nata 
(and 
occasionally 
can 
hardly 
be 
told 
from 
a 
res 
ficta 
et 
picta)25 
is 
in 
any 
case 
something 
evolving, 
young, 
and 
easily 
changed, 
not 
yet 
a 
race, 
let 
alone 
such 
an 
aere 
perennius26 
as 
the 
Jewish 
type: 
these 
“nations” 
really 
should 
carefully 
avoid 
every 
hotheaded 
rivalry 
and 
hostility! 
That 
the 
Jews, 
if 
they 
wanted 
it—or 
if 
they 
were 
forced 
into 
it, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
what 
the 
anti-Semites 
want—could 
even 
now 
have 
preponderance, 
indeed 
quite 
literally 
mastery 
over 
Europe, 
that 
is 
certain; 
that 
they 
are 
not 
working 
and 
planning 
for 
that 
is 
equally 
certain. 


Meanwhile 
they 
want 
and 
wish 
rather, 
even 
with 
some 
importunity, 
to 
be 
absorbed 
and 
assimilated 
by 
Europe; 
they 
long 
to 
be 
fixed, 
permitted, 
respected 
somewhere 
at 
long 
last, 
putting 
an 
end 
to 
the 
nomads’ 
life, 
to 
the 
“Wandering 
Jew”; 
and 
this 
bent 
and 
impulse 
(which 
may 
even 
express 
an 
attenuation 
of 
the 
Jewish 
instincts) 
should 
be 
noted 
well 
and 
accommodated: 
to 
that 
end 
it 
might 
be 
useful 
and 
fair 
to 
expel 
the 
anti-Semitic 
screamers 
from 
the 
country.27 


Accommodated 
with 
all 
caution, 
with 
selection; 
approximately 
as 
the 
English 
nobility 
does. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 
stronger 
and 
already 
more 
clearly 
defined 
types 
of 
the 
new 
Germanism 
can 
enter 
into 
relations 
with 
them 
with 
the 
least 
hesitation; 
for 
example, 
officers 
of 
the 
nobility 
from 
the 
March 
Brandenburg:28 
it 
would 
be 
interesting 
in 
many 
ways 
to 
see 
whether 
the 
hereditary 
art 
of 
commanding 
and 
obeying—in 
both 
of 
these, 
the 
land 
just 
named 
is 
classical 
today—could 
not 
be 
enriched 
with29 
the 
genius 
of 
money 
and 
patience 
(and 
above 
all 
a 
little 
spirituality, 
which 
is 
utterly 
lacking 
among 
these 
officers). 
But 
here 
it 
is 
proper 
to 
break 
off 
my 
cheerful 
Germanomania 
and 
holiday 
oratory; 
for 
I 
am 
beginning 
to 
touch 
on 
what 
is 
serious 
for 
me, 
the 
“European 
problem” 
as 
I 
understand 
it, 
the 
cultivation 
of 
a 
new 
caste 
that 
will 
rule 
Europe. 



252 


They 
are 
no 
philosophical 
race, 
these 
Englishmen: 
Bacon 
signifies 
an 
attack 
on 
the 
philosophical 
spirit; 
Hobbes, 
Hume, 
and 
Locke 
a 
debasement 
and 
lowering 
of 
the 
value 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
“philosophy” 
for 
more 
than 
a 
century. 
It 
was 
against 
Hume 
that 
Kant 
arose, 
and 
rose; 
it 
was 
Locke 
of 
whom 
Schelling 
said, 
understandably, 
“je 
méprise 
Locke”;30 
in 
their 
fight 
against 
the 
English-mechanistic 
doltification 
of 
the 
world, 
Hegel 
and 
Schopenhauer 
were 
of 
one 
mind 
(with 
Goethe)—these 
two 
hostile 
brother 
geniuses 
in 
philosophy 
who 
strove 
apart 
toward 
opposite 
poles 
of 
the 
German 
spirit 
and 
in 
the 
process 
wronged 
each 
other 
as 
only 
brothers 
wrong 
each 
other.31 


What 
was 
lacking 
in 
England, 
and 
always 
has 
been 
lacking 
there, 
was 
known 
well 
enough 
to 
that 
semi-actor 
and 
rhetorician, 
the 
insipid 
muddlehead 
Carlyle, 
who 
tried 
to 
conceal 
behind 
passionate 
grimaces 
what 
he 
knew 
of 
himself—namely, 
what 
was 
lacking 
in 
Carlyle: 
real 
power 
of 
spirituality, 
real 
profundity 
of 
spiritual 
perception; 
in 
brief, 
philosophy. 


It 
is 
characteristic 
of 
such 
an 
unphilosophical 
race 
that 
it 
clings 
firmly 
to 
Christianity: 
they 
need 
its 
discipline 
to 
become 
“moralized” 
and 
somewhat 
humanized. 
The 
English, 
being 
gloomier, 
more 
sensual, 
stronger 
in 
will, 
and 
more 
brutal 
than 
the 
Germans, 
are 
precisely 
for 
that 
reason 
more 
vulgar, 
also 
more 
pious 
than 
the 
Germans: 
they 
stand 
more 
in 
need 
of 
Christianity. 
For 
more 
sensitive 
nostrils 
even 
this 
English 
Christianity 
still 
has 
a 
typically 
English 
odor 
of 
spleen 
and 
alcoholic 
dissipation 
against 
which 
it 
is 
needed 
for 
good 
reasons 
as 
a 
remedy—the 
subtler 
poison 
against 
the 
coarser: 
a 
subtler 
poisoning 
is 
indeed 
for 
clumsy 
peoples 
some 
progress, 
a 
step 
toward 
spiritualization. 
English 
clumsiness 
and 
peasant 
seriousness 
is 
still 
disguised 
most 
tolerably—or 
rather 
elucidated 
and 
reinterpreted—by 
the 
language 
of 
Christian 
gestures 
and 
by 
prayers 
and 
singing 
of 
psalms. 
And 
for 
those 
brutes 
of 
sots 
and 
rakes 
who 
formerly 
learned 
how 
to 
grunt 
morally 
under 
the 
sway 
of 
Methodism 
and 
more 
recently 
again 
as 
a 
“Salvation 
Army,” 
a 
penitential 
spasm 
may 
really 
be 
the 
relatively 
highest 
achievement 
of 
“humanity” 
to 
which 
they 
can 
be 
raised: 
that 
much 
may 
be 
conceded 
in 
all 
fairness. 
But 



what 
is 
offensive 
even 
in 
the 
most 
humane 
Englishman 
is 
his 
lack 
of 
music, 
speaking 
metaphorically 
(but 
not 
only 
metaphorically): 
in 
the 
movements 
of 
his 
soul 
and 
body 
he 
has 
no 
rhythm 
and 
dance, 
indeed 
not 
even 
the 
desire 
for 
rhythm 
and 
dance, 
for 
“music.” 
Listen 
to 
him 
speak; 
watch 
the 
most 
beautiful 
Englishwomen 
walk—there 
are 
no 
more 
beautiful 
doves 
and 
swans 
in 
any 
country 
in 
the 
world—finally 
listen 
to 
them 
sing! 
But 
I 
am 
asking 
too 
much 
— 



253 


There 
are 
truths 
that 
are 
recognized 
best 
by 
mediocre 
minds 
because 
they 
are 
most 
congenial 
to 
them; 
there 
are 
truths 
that 
have 
charm 
and 
seductive 
powers 
only 
for 
mediocre 
spirits: 
we 
come 
up 
against 
this 
perhaps 
disagreeable 
proposition 
just 
now, 
since 
the 
spirit 
of 
respectable 
but 
mediocre 
Englishmen—I 
name 
Darwin, 
John 
Stuart 
Mill, 
and 
Herbert 
Spencer—is 
beginning 
to 
predominate 
in 
the 
middle 
regions 
of 
European 
taste. 
Indeed, 
who 
would 
doubt 
that 
it 
is 
useful 
that 
such 
spirits 
should 
rule 
at 
times? 
It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
spirits 
of 
a 
high 
type 
that 
soar 
on 
their 
own 
paths 
would 
be 
particularly 
skillful 
at 
determining 
and 
collecting 
many 
small 
and 
common 
facts 
and 
then 
drawing 
conclusions 
from 
them: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
being 
exceptions, 
they 
are 
from 
the 
start 
at 
a 
disadvantage 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
the 
“rule.” 
Finally, 
they 
have 
more 
to 
do 
than 
merely 
to 
gain 
knowledge—namely, 
to 
be 
something 
new, 
to 
signify 
something 
new, 
to 
represent 
new 
values. 
Perhaps 
the 
chasm 
between 
know 
and 
can 
is 
greater, 
also 
uncannier, 
than 
people 
suppose: 
those 
who 
can 
do 
things 
in 
the 
grand 
style, 
the 
creative, 
may 
possibly 
have 
to 
be 
lacking 
in 
knowledge—while, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
for 
scientific 
discoveries 
of 
the 
type 
of 
Darwin’s 
a 
certain 
narrowness, 
aridity, 
and 
industrious 
diligence, 
something 
English 
in 
short, 
may 
not 
be 
a 
bad 
disposition. 


Finally, 
we 
should 
not 
forget 
that 
the 
English 
with 
their 
profound 
normality 
have 
once 
before 
caused 
an 
over-all 
depression 
of 
the 
European 
spirit: 
what 
people 
call 
“modern 
ideas” 
or 
“the 
ideas 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century” 
or 
also 
“French 
ideas”—that, 
in 
other 
words, 
against 
which 
the 
German 
spirit 
has 
risen 
with 
a 
profound 
disgust—was 
of 
English 
origin; 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
that. 
The 
French 
have 
merely 
been 
apes 
and 
mimes 
of 
these 
ideas; 
also 
their 
best 
soldiers; 
unfortunately, 
their 
first 
and 
most 
thoroughgoing 
victims 
as 
well: 
for 
over 
this 
damnable 
Anglomania 
of 
“modern 
ideas” 
the 
âme 
française32 
has 
in 
the 
end 
become 
so 
thin 
and 
emaciated 
that 
today 
one 
recalls 
her 
sixteenth 
and 
seventeenth 
centuries, 
her 
profound 
and 
passionate 
strength, 
and 
her 
inventive 
nobility 
almost 
with 
disbelief. 
Yet 
we 
must 
hang 
on 
to 
this 
proposition 
of 
historical 
fairness 
with 



our 
very 
teeth, 
defending 
it 
against 
momentary 
appearances: 
European 
noblesse—of 
feeling, 
of 
taste, 
of 
manners, 
taking 
the 
word, 
in 
short, 
in 
every 
higher 
sense—is 
the 
work 
and 
invention 
of 
France; 
European 
vulgarity, 
the 
plebeianism 
of 
modern 
ideas, 
that 
of 
England.—33 



254 


Even 
now 
France 
is 
still 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
most 
spiritual 
and 
sophisticated 
culture 
in 
Europe 
and 
the 
foremost 
school 
of 
taste—but 
one 
has 
to 
know 
how 
to 
find 
this 
“France 
of 
taste.”34 


Those 
who 
belong 
to 
it 
stay 
well 
hidden: 
it 
may 
be 
a 
small 
number 
in 
whom 
it 
lives—at 
that, 
perhaps 
human 
beings 
whose 
legs 
might 
be 
sturdier, 
some 
of 
them 
fatalists, 
somber 
and 
sick, 
some 
of 
them 
overly 
delicate 
and 
artificial, 
such 
as 
have 
the 
ambition 
to 
hide. 
One 
point 
they 
all 
have 
in 
common: 
they 
plug 
their 
ears 
against 
the 
raging 
stupidity 
and 
the 
noisy 
twaddle 
of 
the 
democratic 
bourgeois. 
Indeed, 
the 
foreground 
today 
is 
taken 
up 
by 
a 
part 
of 
France 
that 
has 
become 
stupid 
and 
coarse: 
recently, 
at 
Victor 
Hugo’s 
funeral,35 
it 
celebrated 
a 
veritable 
orgy 
of 
bad 
taste 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
self-admiration. 
They 
have 
in 
common 
one 
other 
point 
as 
well: 
the 
good 
will 
to 
resist 
any 
spiritual 
Germanization—and 
a 
still 
better 
incapacity 
to 
succeed. 


Perhaps 
Schopenhauer 
is 
even 
now 
more 
at 
home 
and 
indigenous 
in 
this 
France 
of 
the 
spirit, 
which 
is 
also 
a 
France 
of 
pessimism, 
than 
he 
ever 
was 
in 
Germany—not 
to 
speak 
of 
Heinrich 
Heine, 
who 
has 
long 
become 
part 
of 
the 
very 
flesh 
and 
blood 
of 
the 
subtler 
and 
more 
demanding 
lyric 
poets 
of 
Paris, 
or 
of 
Hegel, 
who 
today 
exerts 
an 
almost 
tyrannical 
influence 
through 
Taine, 
who 
is 
the 
foremost 
historian 
now 
living. 
But 
as 
for 
Richard 
Wagner: 
the 
more 
French 
music 
learns 
to 
form 
itself 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
actual 
needs 
of 
the 
âme 
moderne,36 
the 
more 
it 
will 
“Wagnerize”— 
that 
one 
can 
predict— 
and 
it 
is 
doing 
enough 
of 
that 
even 
now. 


Nevertheless, 
there 
are 
three 
things 
to 
which 
the 
French 
can 
still 
point 
with 
pride 
today, 
as 
their 
heritage 
and 
possession 
and 
an 
enduring 
mark 
of 
their 
ancient 
cultural 
superiority 
over 
Europe, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
voluntary 
and 
involuntary 
Germanization 
and 
vulgarization 
of 
their 
taste. 
First, 
the 
capacity 
for 
artistic 
passions, 
for 
that 
devotion 
to 
“form” 
for 
which 
the 
phrase 
l’art 
pour 
l’art 
has 
been 
invented 
along 
with 
a 
thousand 
others: 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
has 
not 
been 
lacking 
in 
France 
for 
the 
last 
three 
centuries 
and 
has 
made 
possible 
again 
and 
again, 
thanks 
to 
their 
reverence 
for 
the 
“small 
number,” 
a 



kind 
of 
chamber 
music 
in 
literature 
for 
which 
one 
looks 
in 
vain 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
Europe. 


The 
second 
thing 
on 
which 
the 
French 
can 
base 
a 
superiority 
over 
Europe 
is 
their 
old, 
manifold, 
moralistic37 
culture, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
we 
find, 
on 
the 
average, 
even 
in 
the 
little 
romanciers 
of 
the 
newspapers 
and 
in 
chance 
boulevardiers 
de 
Paris 
a 
psychological 
oversensitivity 
and 
curiosity 
of 
which 
in 
Germany, 
for 
example, 
one 
simply 
has 
no 
idea 
(let 
alone 
the 
thing 
itself). 
For 
this 
the 
Germans 
lack 
a 
few 
centuries 
of 
moralistic 
work 
which, 
as 
mentioned, 
France 
did 
not 
spare 
herself; 
anyone 
who 
calls 
the 
Germans 
“naïve” 
on 
that 
account 
praises 
them 
for 
a 
defect. 
(By 
way 
of 
contrast 
to 
the 
German 
inexperience 
and 
innocence 
in 
voluptate 
psychological,38 
which 
is 
none 
too 
distantly 
related 
to 
the 
tediousness 
of 
German 
company, 
and 
as 
the 
most 
consummate 
expression 
of 
a 
typically 
French 
curiosity 
and 
inventiveness 
for 
this 
realm 
of 
delicate 
thrills, 
one 
may 
consider 
Henri 
Beyle,39 
that 
remarkable 
anticipatory 
and 
precursory 
human 
being 
who 
ran 
with 
a 
Napoleonic 
tempo 
through 
his 
Europe, 
through 
several 
centuries 
of 
the 
European 
soul, 
as 
an 
explorer 
and 
discoverer 
of 
this 
soul: 
it 
required 
two 
generations 
to 
catch 
up 
with 
him 
in 
any 
way, 
to 
figure 
out 
again 
a 
few 
of 
the 
riddles 
that 
tormented 
and 
enchanted 
him, 
this 
odd 
epicurean 
and 
question 
mark 
of 
a 
man 
who 
was 
France’s 
last 
great 
psychologist.) 


There 
is 
yet 
a 
third 
claim 
to 
superiority. 
The 
French 
character 
contains 
a 
halfway 
successful 
synthesis 
of 
the 
north 
and 
the 
south 
which 
allows 
them 
to 
comprehend 
many 
things 
and 
to 
do 
things 
which 
an 
Englishman 
could 
never 
understand. 
Their 
temperament, 
periodically 
turned 
toward 
and 
away 
from 
the 
south, 
in 
which 
from 
time 
to 
time 
Provençal 
and 
Ligurian 
blood 
foams 
over, 
protects 
them 
against 
the 
gruesome 
northern 
gray 
on 
gray 
and 
the 
sunless 
concept-spooking 
and 
anemia—the 
disease 
of 
German 
taste 
against 
whose 
excesses 
one 
has 
now 
prescribed 
for 
oneself, 
with 
considerable 
resolution, 
blood 
and 
iron,40 
which 
means 
“great 
politics” 
(in 
accordance 
with 
a 
dangerous 
healing 
art 
which 
teaches 
me 
to 
wait 
and 
wait 
but 
so 
far 
has 
not 
taught 
me 
any 
hope.) 
Even 
now 
one 
still 
encounters 
in 
France 
an 
advance 
understanding 
and 
accommodation 
of 
those 
rarer 
and 
rarely 
contented 
human 
beings 
who 
are 
too 
comprehensive 
to 
find 
satisfaction 
in 
any 
fatherlandishness 
and 
know 
how 
to 
love 
the 
south 
in 
the 
north 
and 
the 
north 
in 
the 
south—the 
born 
Midlanders, 
the 
“good 
Europeans.” 


It 
was 
for 
them 
that 
Bizet 
made 
music, 
this 
last 
genius 
to 
see 
a 
new 
beauty 
and 
seduction—who 
discovered 
a 
piece 
of 
the 
south 
of 
music. 



255 


Against 
German 
music 
all 
kinds 
of 
precautions 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
be 
indicated. 
Suppose 
somebody 
loves 
the 
south 
as 
I 
love 
it, 
as 
a 
great 
school 
of 
convalescence, 
in 
the 
most 
spiritual 
as 
well 
as 
the 
most 
sensuous 
sense, 
as 
an 
uncontainable 
abundance 
of 
sun 
and 
transfiguration 
by 
the 
sun 
that 
suffuses 
an 
existence 
that 
believes 
and 
glories 
in 
itself: 
well, 
such 
a 
person 
will 
learn 
to 
be 
somewhat 
on 
his 
guard 
against 
German 
music, 
because 
in 
corrupting 
his 
taste 
again 
it 
also 
corrupts 
his 
health 
again. 


If 
such 
a 
southerner, 
not 
by 
descent 
but 
by 
faith, 
should 
dream 
of 
the 
future 
of 
music, 
he 
must 
also 
dream 
of 
the 
redemption 
of 
music 
from 
the 
north, 
and 
in 
his 
ears 
he 
must 
have 
the 
prelude 
of 
a 
more 
profound, 
more 
powerful, 
perhaps 
more 
evil 
and 
mysterious 
music, 
a 
supra-German 
music 
that 
does 
not 
fade 
away 
at 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
voluptuous 
blue 
sea 
and 
the 
brightness 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
sky, 
nor 
does 
it 
turn 
yellow 
and 
then 
pale 
as 
all 
German 
music 
does—a 
supra-European 
music 
that 
prevails 
even 
before 
the 
brown 
sunsets 
of 
the 
desert, 
a 
music 
whose 
soul 
is 
related 
to 
palm 
trees 
and 
feels 
at 
home 
and 
knows 
how 
to 
roam 
among 
great, 
beautiful, 
lonely 
beasts 
of 
prey— 


I 
could 
imagine 
a 
music 
whose 
rarest 
magic 
would 
consist 
in 
its 
no 
longer 
knowing 
anything 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
only 
now 
and 
then 
some 
sailor 
nostalgia, 
some 
golden 
shadows 
and 
delicate 
weaknesses 
would 
pass 
over 
it—an 
art 
that 
from 
a 
great 
distance 
would 
behold, 
fleeing 
toward 
it, 
the 
colors 
of 
a 
setting 
moral 
world 
that 
had 
almost 
become 
unintelligible—and 
that 
would 
be 
hospitable 
and 
profound 
enough 
to 
receive 
such 
late 
fugitives.— 



256 


Owing 
to 
the 
pathological 
estrangement 
which 
the 
insanity 
of 
nationality 
has 
induced, 
and 
still 
induces, 
among 
the 
peoples 
of 
Europe; 
owing 
also 
to 
the 
shortsighted 
and 
quick-handed 
politicians 
who 
are 
at 
the 
top 
today 
with 
the 
help 
of 
this 
insanity, 
without 
any 
inkling 
that 
their 
separatist 
policies 
can 
of 
necessity 
only 
be 
entr’acte 
policies; 
owing 
to 
all 
this 
and 
much 
else 
that 
today 
simply 
cannot 
be 
said, 
the 
most 
unequivocal 
portents 
are 
now 
being 
overlooked, 
or 
arbitrarily 
and 
mendaciously 
reinterpreted—that 
Europe 
wants 
to 
become 
one. 


In 
all 
the 
more 
profound 
and 
comprehensive 
men 
of 
this 
century, 
the 
overall 
direction 
of 
the 
mysterious 
workings 
of 
their 
soul 
was 
to 
prepare 
the 
way 
for 
this 
new 
synthesis 
and 
to 
anticipate 
experimentally 
the 
European 
of 
the 
future: 
only 
in 
their 
foregrounds 
or 
in 
weaker 
hours, 
say 
in 
old 
age, 
did 
they 
belong 
to 
the 
“fatherlandish”—they 
were 
merely 
taking 
a 
rest 
from 
themselves 
when 
they 
became 
“patriots.” 
I 
am 
thinking 
of 
such 
human 
beings 
as 
Napoleon, 
Goethe, 
Beethoven, 
Stendhal, 
Heinrich 
Heine, 
Schopenhauer: 
do 
not 
hold 
it 
against 
me 
when 
I 
include 
Richard 
Wagner, 
too, 
with 
them, 
for 
one 
should 
not 
allow 
oneself 
to 
be 
led 
astray 
about 
him 
by 
his 
own 
misunderstandings—geniuses 
of 
his 
type 
rarely 
have 
the 
right 
to 
understand 
themselves. 
Even 
less, 
to 
be 
sure, 
by 
the 
indecent 
noise 
with 
which 
people 
in 
France 
now 
close 
themselves 
off 
against 
him 
and 
resist 
him: 
the 
fact 
remains 
nevertheless 
that 
the 
late 
French 
romanticism 
of 
the 
forties 
and 
Richard 
Wagner 
belong 
together 
most 
closely 
and 
intimately. 
In 
all 
the 
heights 
and 
depths 
of 
their 
needs 
they 
are 
related, 
fundamentally 
related: 
it 
is 
Europe, 
the 
one 
Europe, 
whose 
soul 
surges 
and 
longs 
to 
get 
further 
and 
higher 
through 
their 
manifold 
and 
impetuous 
art—where? 
into 
a 
new 
light? 
toward 
a 
new 
sun? 
But 
who 
could 
express 
precisely 
what 
all 
these 
masters 
of 
new 
means 
of 
language 
could 
not 
express 
precisely? 
What 
is 
certain 
is 
that 
the 
same 
storm 
and 
stress 
tormented 
them 
and 
that 
they 
sought 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
these 
last 
great 
seekers! 


Literature 
dominated 
all 
of 
them 
up 
to 
their 
eyes 
and 
ears—they 
were 
the 
first 
artists 
steeped 
in 
world 
literature—and 
most 
of 
them 
were 
themselves 
writers, 
poets, 
mediators 
and 
mixers 
of 
the 
arts 
and 
senses 
(as 
a 
musician, 



Wagner 
belongs 
among 
painters; 
as 
a 
poet, 
among 
musicians; 
as 
an 
artist 
in 
general, 
among 
actors); 
all 
of 
them 
were 
fanatics 
of 
expression 
“at 
any 
price”—I 
should 
stress 
Delacroix, 
who 
was 
most 
closely 
related 
to 
Wagner— 
all 
of 
them 
great 
discoverers 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
sublime, 
also 
of 
the 
ugly 
and 
gruesome, 
and 
still 
greater 
discoverers 
concerning 
effects, 
display, 
and 
the 
art 
of 
display 
windows—all 
of 
them 
talents 
far 
beyond 
their 
genius—virtuosos 
through 
and 
through, 
with 
uncanny 
access 
to 
everything 
that 
seduces, 
allures, 
compels, 
overthrows; 
born 
enemies 
of 
logic 
and 
straight 
lines, 
lusting 
after 
the 
foreign, 
the 
exotic, 
the 
tremendous, 
the 
crooked, 
the 
self-contradictory; 
as 
human 
beings, 
Tantaluses 
of 
the 
will, 
successful 
plebeians 
who 
knew 
themselves 
to 
be 
incapable, 
both 
in 
their 
lives 
and 
works, 
of 
a 
noble 
tempo, 
a 
lento41 


—take 
Balzac, 
for 
example—unbridled 
workers, 
almost 
self-destroyers 
through 
work; 
antinomians 
and 
rebels 
against 
custom, 
ambitious 
and 
insatiable 
without 
balance 
and 
enjoyment; 
all 
of 
them 
broke 
and 
collapsed 
in 
the 
end 
before 
the 
Christian 
cross 
(with 
right 
and 
reason: 
for 
who 
among 
them 
would 
have 
been 
profound 
and 
original42 
enough 
for 
a 
philosophy 
of 
the 
Antichrist?)—on 
the 
whole, 
an 
audaciously 
daring, 
magnificently 
violent 
type 
of 
higher 
human 
beings 
who 
soared, 
and 
tore 
others 
along, 
to 
the 
heights 
—it 
fell 
to 
them 
to 
first 
teach 
their 
century—and 
it 
is 
the 
century 
of 
the 
crowd!—the 
concept 
“higher 
man”— 


Let 
the 
German 
friends 
of 
Richard 
Wagner 
ponder 
whether 
there 
is 
in 
Wagner’s 
art 
anything 
outright 
German, 
or 
whether 
it 
is 
not 
just 
its 
distinction 
that 
it 
derives 
from 
supra-German 
sources 
and 
impulses. 
Nor 
should 
it 
be 
underestimated 
to 
what 
extent 
Paris 
was 
indispensable 
for 
the 
development 
of 
his 
type, 
and 
at 
the 
decisive 
moment 
the 
depth 
of 
his 
instincts 
led 
him 
to 
Paris. 
His 
entire 
manner 
and 
self-apostolate 
could 
perfect 
itself 
only 
when 
he 
saw 
the 
model 
of 
the 
French 
socialists. 
Perhaps 
it 
will 
be 
found 
after 
a 
subtler 
comparison 
that, 
to 
the 
honor 
of 
Richard 
Wagner’s 
German 
nature, 
his 
doings 
were 
in 
every 
respect 
stronger, 
more 
audacious, 
harder, 
and 
higher 
than 
anything 
a 
Frenchman 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
could 
manage— 
thanks 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
Germans 
are 
still 
closer 
to 
barbarism 
than 
the 
French. 
Perhaps 
Wagner’s 
strangest 
creation 
is 
inaccessible, 
inimitable, 
and 
beyond 
the 
feelings 
of 
the 
whole, 
so 
mature, 
Latin 
race, 
not 
only 
today 
but 
forever: 
the 
figure 
of 
Siegfried, 
that 
very 
free 
man 
who 
may 
indeed 
be 
much 
too 
free, 
too 
hard, 
too 
cheerful, 
too 
healthy, 
too 
anti-Catholic 
for 
the 
taste 
of 
ancient 
and 
mellow 
cultured 
peoples. 
He 
may 
even 
have 
been 
a 
sin 
against 



romanticism, 
this 
anti-romantic 
Siegfried: 
well, 
Wagner 
more 
than 
atoned 
for 
this 
sin 
in 
his 
old 
and 
glum 
days 
when—anticipating 
a 
taste 
that 
has 
since 
then 
become 
political—he 
began, 
if 
not 
to 
walk, 
at 
least 
to 
preach, 
with 
his 
characteristic 
religious 
vehemence, 
the 
way 
to 
Rome. 


Lest 
these 
final 
words 
be 
misunderstood, 
I 
will 
enlist 
the 
assistance 
of 
a 
few 
vigorous 
rhymes 
which 
will 
betray 
to 
less 
subtle 
ears, 
too, 
what 
I 
want— 
what 
I 
have 
against 
the 
“final 
Wagner” 
and 
his 
Parsifal 
music: 


—Is 
this 
still 
German?— 
Out 
of 
a 
German 
heart, 
this 
sultry 
screeching? 
a 
German 
body, 
this 
self-laceration? 
German, 
this 
priestly 
affectation, 
this 
incense-perfumed 
sensual 
preaching? 
German, 
this 
halting, 
plunging, 
reeling, 
this 
so 
uncertain 
bim-bam 
pealing? 
this 
nunnish 
ogling, 
Ave 
leavening, 
this 
whole 
falsely 
ecstatic 
heaven 
overheavening? 
—Is 
this 
still 
German?— 
You 
still 
stand 
at 
the 
gate, 
perplexed? 
Think! 
What 
you 
hear 
is 
Rome—Rome’s 
faith 
without 
the 
text.

at

in

It 
can

hollow

applied 
to 
a 
sound, 
heavy 
and 
musty 
applied 
to 
air, 
dull 
applied 
to 
wits, 
and 
is 
a 
cousin 
of 
the 
English 
words, 
dumb 
and 
damp. 
Goethe 
still 
used 
it 
with 
a 
positive 
connotation 
when 
he 
wrote 
poetry 
about 
inarticulate 
feelings; 
Nietzsche

the

often—with 
a 
strongly 
negative, 
anti-romantic

probably 
France. 
Of

the

made

generally, 
but 
this

of 
Bismarck 
at 
the 
zenith 
of 
his 
success 
and 
power 
certainly 
shows 
an 
amazing 
independence 
of

and 
without 
grasping 
the 
full 
weight 
of 
the

one 
cannot

In 
the

though 
a 
few 
have 
been

Plainly 
it 
is 
part 
of 
the 
aim 
of 
these

present

Nietzsche 
inverts 
the 
anti-Semitic 
cliché 
that 
the 
Jews 
are 



uncreative 
parasites 
who 
excel, 
if 
at 
all, 
only 
as 
performers 
and 
interpreters. 
(Cf. 
also, 
e.g., 
section 
52 
above 
and 
his 
praise 
of 
Mendelssohn 
in 
section 
245.) 
The 
image 
of 
the 
Jews 
“lusting 
after 
foreign 
races” 
was 
a 
cliché 
of 
German 
anti-Semitism, 
but 
it 
is 
entirely 
characteristic 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
style 
of 
thinking 
and 
writing 
that 
the 
phrase 
is 
“spiritualized” 
(to 
use 
his 
own 
term) 
and 
moreover 
used 
in 
a 
context 
which 
makes 
plain—for 
those 
who 
read 
and 
do 
not 
merely 
browse—that 
Nietzsche’s 
meaning 
is 
utterly 
opposed 
to 
that 
previously 
associated 
with 
the 
words. 
His 
famous 
“revaluation” 
begins 
with 
words 
that 
receive 
new 
values. 


Nietzsche’s 
conception 
of 
the 
Greeks 
and 
Romans 
also 
inverts 
the 
usual 
view. 
In 
his 
frequent 
insistence 
on 
the 
debt 
of 
the 
Greeks 
to 
earlier 
civilizations 
he 
was 
at 
least 
half 
a 
century 
ahead 
of 
his 
time. 


21 
Cf. 
section 
195 
above. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
these 
two 
sections 
it 
seems 
probable 
that 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
Germans 
(“in 
all 
modesty”) 
in 
section 
248 
alludes 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
ambitions. 
He 
is 
hoping 
to 
initiate 
a 
“revaluation” 
comparable 
to 
that 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Jews 
in 
section 
195: 
they 
are 
his 
model. 
Of 
course, 
he 
does 
not 
agree 
with 
the 
values 
he 
ascribes 
to 
them; 
but 
the 
whole 
book 
represents 
an 
effort 
to 
rise 
“beyond” 
simpleminded 
agreement 
and 
disagreement, 
beyond 
the 
vulgar 
faith 
in 
antithetic 
values, 
“beyond 
good 
and 
evil.” 
The 
point 
of 
that 
title 
is 
not 
that 
the 
author 
considers 
himself 
beyond 
good 
and 
evil 
in 
the 
crudest 
sense, 
but 
it 
is 
in 
part 
that 
he 
is 
beyond 
saying 
such 
silly 
things 
as 
“the 
Jews 
are 
good” 
or 
“the 
Jews 
are 
evil”; 
or 
“free 
spirits” 
or 
“scholars” 
or 
“virtues” 
or 
“honesty” 
or 
“humaneness” 
are 
“good” 
or 
“evil.” 
Everywhere 
he 
introduces 
distinctions, 
etching 
first 
one 
type 
and 
then 
another—both 
generally 
confounded 
under 
a 
single 
label. 
He 
asks 
us 
to 
shift 
perspectives, 
or 
to 
perceive 
hues

Heinrich 
von 
Sybel 
(1817-95) 
and 
Heinrich 
von 
Treitschke 
(1834-96) 
were 
among 
the 
leading 
German 
historians 
of 
their 
time. 



Sybel 
was 
for 
many 
years 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Prussian 
parliament. 
At 
one 
time 
a 
critic 
of 
Bismarck, 
he 
strongly 
supported 
many 
of 
Bismarck’s 
policies, 
beginning 
in 
1866. 
In 
1875 
Bismarck 
appointed 
him 
director 
of 
the 
Prussian 
archives. 
His 
major 
works 
include 
Die 
deutsche 
Nation 
und 
das 
Kaiserreich 
(the 
German 
nation 
and 
the 
Empire; 
1862) 
and 
Die 
Begründung 
des 
deutschen 
Reiches 
durch 
Wilhelm 
I 
(1889-94; 
English 
version, 
The 
Founding 
of 
the 
German 
Empire 
by 
William 
I, 
trans. 
Marshall 
Livingston, 
1890-98). 


Treitschke, 
born 
at 
Dresden, 
was 
a 
Liberal 
as 
a 
young 
man. 
By 
1866, 
when 
Prussia 
went 
to 
war 
against 
Austria, 
“his 
sympathies 
with 
Prussia 
were 
so 
strong 
that 
he 
went 
to 
Berlin 
[from 
Freiburg, 
where 
he 
had 
been 
a 
professor], 
became 
a 
Prussian 
subject, 
and 
was 
appointed 
editor 
of 
the 
Preussische 
Jahrbücher” 
(Encyclopaedia 
Britannica, 
11th 
ed.). 
In 
1871 
he 
became 
a 
member 
of 
the 
new 
imperial 
parliament, 
and 
in 
1874 
a 
professor 
of 
history 
at 
Berlin. 
He 
became 
“the 
chief 
panegyrist 
of 
the 
house 
of 
Hohenzollern. 
He 
did 
more 
than 
anyone 
to 
mould 
the 
minds 
of 
the 
rising 
generation, 
and 
he 
carried 
them 
with 
him 
even 
in 
his 
violent 
attacks 
on 
all 
opinions 
and 
all 
parties 
which 
appeared 
in 
any 
way 
to 
be 
injurious 
to 
the 
rising 
power 
of 
Germany. 
He 
supported 
the 
government 
in 
its 
attempts 
to 
subdue 
by 
legislation 
the 
Socialists, 
Poles, 
and 
Catholics; 
and 
he 
was 
one 
of 
the 
few 
men 
of 
eminence 
who 
gave 
the 
sanction 
of 
his 
name 
to 
the 
attacks 
on 
the 
Jews 
which 
began 
in 
1878. 
As 
a 
strong 
advocate 
of 
colonial 
expansion, 
he 
was 
also 
a 
bitter 
enemy 
of 
Great 
Britain, 
and 
he 
was 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
responsible 
for 
the 
anti-
British 
feeling 
of 
German 
Chauvinism 
during 
the 
last 
years 
of 
the 
19th 
century” 
(ibid.). 


Although 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
references 
to 
Treitschke 
are 
vitriolic 
(there 
are 
three 
in 
Ecce 
Homo), 
uninformed 
writers 
have 
occasionally 
linked 
Nietzsche 
and 
Treitschke 
as 
if 
both 
had 
been 
German 
nationalists.

None 
of 
this 
prevented 
Richard 
Oehler 
from 
quoting 
a 
passage 
from 
this 
section, 
out 
of 
context, 
in 
one 
of 
the 
first 
Nazi 
books 
on 



Nietzsche, 
after 
saying: 
“To 
wish 
to 
give 
proof 
regarding 
Nietzsche’s 
thoughts 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
that 
they 
agree 
with 
the 
race 
views 
and 
strivings 
of 
the 
National 
Socialist 
movement 
would 
be 
carrying 
coals 
to 
Newcastle” 
(Friedrich 
Nietzsche 
und 
die 
deutsche 
Zukunft, 
Leipzig 
[Friedrich 
Nietzsche 
and 
the 
German 
future], 
1935, 
p. 
86). 
Oehler 
knew 
better: 
he 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
editors 
of 
the 
collected 
works 
and 
had 
even 
then 
compiled 
elaborate 
indices 
for 
two 
editions—one 
of 
these 
indices 
comprised 
two 
and 
a 
half 
large 
volumes—and 
later 
he 
compiled 
a 
third 
one 
for 
yet 
another 
edition. 
But 
the 
Nazis’ 
occasional 
use 
and 
perversion 
of 
Nietzsche 
was 
completely 
devoid 
of 
the 
most 
elementary 
scruples.

Bismarck’s 
famous 
phrase. 
On 
May 
12, 
1859, 
writing 
to 
the 
cabinet 
minister 
Schleinitz 
from 
St. 
Petersburg, 
Bismarck 
spoke 
of 
“an 
infirmity 
of 
Prussia 
that 
sooner 
or 
later 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
cure 
ferro 
et 
ighi.” 
In 
an 
evening 
session 
of 
the 
budget 
commission 
of 
the 
Prussian 
parliament, 
September 
30, 
1862, 
he 
said: 
“It 
is 
not 
by 
speeches 
and 
majority 
resolutions 
that 
the 
great 
questions 
of 
the 
time 
are 
decided— 
that 
was 
the 
mistake 
of 
1848 
and 
1849—but 
by 
iron 
and 
blood.” 
And 
on 
January 
28, 
1886, 
Bismarck 
said 
to 
the 
Parliament: 
“It 
is 
not 
my 
fault 
that 
at 
that 
time 
I 
was 
misunderstood. 
It 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
military

said:

and

as 
possible,

of 
the 
king 
of 
Prussia, 
then 
he 
will 
be 
able 
to 
make 
the

you 
desire;

it 
cannot

Every 
enhancement 
of 
the 
type 
“man” 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
work 
of 
an 
aristocratic 
society—and 
it 
will 
be 
so 
again 
and 
again—a 
society 
that 
believes 
in 
the 
long 
ladder 
of 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
and 
differences 
in 
value 
between 
man 
and 
man, 
and 
that 
needs 
slavery 
in 
some 
sense 
or 
other. 
Without 
that 
pathos 
of 
distance 
which 
grows 
out 
of 
the 
ingrained 
difference 
between 
strata2 


—when 
the 
ruling 
caste 
constantly 
looks 
afar 
and 
looks 
down 
upon 
subjects 
and 
instruments 
and 
just 
as 
constantly 
practices 
obedience 
and 
command, 
keeping 
down 
and 
keeping 
at 
a 
distance—that 
other, 
more 
mysterious 
pathos 
could 
not 
have 
grown 
up 
either—the 
craving 
for 
an 
ever 
new 
widening 
of 
distances 
within 
the 
soul 
itself, 
the 
development 
of 
ever 
higher, 
rarer, 
more 
remote, 
further-stretching, 
more 
comprehensive 
states—in 
brief, 
simply 
the 
enhancement 
of 
the 
type 
“man,” 
the 
continual 
“selfovercoming 
of 
man,” 
to 
use 
a 
moral 
formula 
in 
a 
supra-moral 
sense. 


To 
be 
sure, 
one 
should 
not 
yield 
to 
humanitarian 
illusions 
about 
the 
origins 
of 
an 
aristocratic 
society 
(and 
thus 
of 
the 
presupposition 
of 
this 
enhancement 
of 
the 
type 
“man”): 
truth 
is 
hard. 
Let 
us 
admit 
to 
ourselves, 
without 
trying 
to 
be 
considerate, 
how 
every 
higher 
culture 
on 
earth 
so 
far 
has 
begun. 
Human 
beings 
whose 
nature 
was 
still 
natural, 
barbarians 
in 
every 
terrible 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
men 
of 
prey 
who 
were 
still 
in 
possession 
of 
unbroken 
strength 
of 
will 
and 
lust 
for 
power, 
hurled 
themselves 
upon 
weaker, 
more 
civilized, 
more 
peaceful 
races, 
perhaps 
traders 
or 
cattle 
raisers, 
or 
upon 
mellow 
old 
cultures 
whose 
last 
vitality 
was 
even 
then 
flaring 
up 
in 
splendid 
fireworks 
of 
spirit 
and 
corruption. 
In 
the 
beginning, 
the 
noble 
caste 
was 
always 
the 
barbarian 
caste: 
their 
predominance 
did 
not 
lie 
mainly 
in 
physical 
strength 
but 
in 
strength 
of 
the 
soul—they 
were 
more 
whole 
human 
beings 
(which 
also 
means, 
at 
every 
level, 
“more 
whole 
beasts”). 



258 


Corruption 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
a 
threatening 
anarchy 
among 
the 
instincts 
and 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
affects, 
which 
is 
called 
“life,” 
has 
been 
shaken: 
corruption 
is 
something 
totally 
different 
depending 
on 
the 
organism 
in 
which 
it 
appears. 
When, 
for 
example, 
an 
aristocracy, 
like 
that 
of 
France 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Revolution, 
throws 
away 
its 
privileges 
with 
a 
sublime 
disgust 
and 
sacrifices 
itself 
to 
an 
extravagance 
of 
its 
own 
moral 
feelings, 
that 
is 
corruption; 
it 
was 
really 
only 
the 
last 
act 
of 
that 
centuries-old 
corruption 
which 
had 
led 
them 
to 
surrender, 
step 
by 
step, 
their 
governmental 
prerogatives, 
demoting 
themselves 
to 
a 
mere 
function 
of 
the 
monarchy 
(finally 
even 
to 
a 
mere 
ornament 
and 
showpiece). 
The 
essential 
characteristic 
of 
a 
good 
and 
healthy 
aristocracy, 
however, 
is 
that 
it 
experiences 
itself 
not 
as 
a 
function 
(whether 
of 
the 
monarchy 
or 
the 
commonwealth) 
but 
as 
their 
meaning 
and 
highest 
justification—that 
it 
therefore 
accepts 
with 
a 
good 
conscience 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
untold 
human 
beings 
who, 
for 
its 
sake, 
must 
be 
reduced 
and 
lowered 
to 
incomplete 
human 
beings, 
to 
slaves, 
to 
instruments. 
Their 
fundamental 
faith 
simply 
has 
to 
be 
that 
society 
must 
not 
exist 
for 
society’s 
sake 
but 
only 
as 
the 
foundation 
and 
scaffolding 
on 
which 
a 
choice 
type 
of 
being 
is 
able 
to 
raise 
itself 
to 
its 
higher 
task 
and 
to 
a 
higher 
state 
of 
being3 


—comparable 
to 
those 
sun-seeking 
vines 
of 
Java—they 
are 
called 
Sipo 
Matador—that 
so 
long 
and 
so 
often 
enclasp 
an 
oak 
tree 
with 
their 
tendrils 
until 
eventually, 
high 
above 
it 
but 
supported 
by 
it, 
they 
can 
unfold 
their 
crowns 
in 
the 
open 
light 
and 
display 
their 
happiness. 



259 


Refraining 
mutually 
from 
injury, 
violence, 
and 
exploitation 
and 
placing 
one’s 
will 
on 
a 
par 
with 
that 
of 
someone 
else—this 
may 
become, 
in 
a 
certain 
rough 
sense, 
good 
manners 
among 
individuals 
if 
the 
appropriate 
conditions 
are 
present 
(namely, 
if 
these 
men 
are 
actually 
similar 
in 
strength 
and 
value 
standards 
and 
belong 
together 
in 
one 
body). 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
principle 
is 
extended, 
and 
possibly 
even 
accepted 
as 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
society, 
it 
immediately 
proves 
to 
be 
what 
it 
really 
is—a 
will 
to 
the 
denial 
of 
life, 
a 
principle 
of 
disintegration 
and 
decay. 


Here 
we 
must 
beware 
of 
superficiality 
and 
get 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
matter, 
resisting 
all 
sentimental 
weakness: 
life 
itself 
is 
essentially 
appropriation, 
injury, 
overpowering 
of 
what 
is 
alien 
and 
weaker; 
suppression, 
hardness, 
imposition 
of 
one’s 
own 
forms, 
incorporation 
and 
at 
least, 
at 
its 
mildest, 
exploitation—but 
why 
should 
one 
always 
use 
those 
words 
in 
which 
a 
slanderous 
intent 
has 
been 
imprinted 
for 
ages? 


Even 
the 
body 
within 
which 
individuals 
treat 
each 
other 
as 
equals, 
as 
suggested 
before—and 
this 
happens 
in 
every 
healthy 
aristocracy—if 
it 
is 
a 
living 
and 
not 
a 
dying 
body, 
has 
to 
do 
to 
other 
bodies 
what 
the 
individuals 
within 
it 
refrain 
from 
doing 
to 
each 
other: 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
an 
incarnate 
will 
to 
power, 
it 
will 
strive 
to 
grow, 
spread, 
seize, 
become 
predominant—not 
from 
any 
morality 
or 
immorality 
but 
because 
it 
is 
living 
and 
because 
life 
simply 
is 
will 
to 
power. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
point 
on 
which 
the 
ordinary 
consciousness 
of 
Europeans 
resists 
instruction 
as 
on 
this: 
everywhere 
people 
are 
now 
raving, 
even 
under 
scientific 
disguises, 
about 
coming 
conditions 
of 
society 
in 
which 
“the 
exploitative 
aspect” 
will 
be 
removed—which 
sounds 
to 
me 
as 
if 
they 
promised 
to 
invent 
a 
way 
of 
life 
that 
would 
dispense 
with 
all 
organic 
functions. 
“Exploitation” 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
a 
corrupt 
or 
imperfect 
and 
primitive 
society: 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
essence 
of 
what 
lives, 
as 
a 
basic 
organic 
function; 
it 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
which 
is 
after 
all 
the 
will 
of 
life. 


If 
this 
should 
be 
an 
innovation 
as 
a 
theory—as 
a 
reality 
it 
is 
the 
primordial 
fact 
of 
all 
history: 
people 
ought 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
themselves 
at 
least 
that 
far.

Wandering 
through 
the 
many 
subtler 
and 
coarser 
moralities 
which 
have 
so 
far 
been 
prevalent 
on 
earth, 
or 
still 
are 
prevalent, 
I 
found 
that 
certain 
features 
recurred 
regularly 
together 
and 
were 
closely 
associated—until 
I 
finally 
discovered 
two 
basic 
types 
and 
one 
basic 
difference. 


There 
are 
master 
morality 
and 
slave 
morality4—I 
add 
immediately 
that 
in 
all 
the 
higher 
and 
more 
mixed 
cultures 
there 
also 
appear 
attempts 
at 
mediation 
between 
these 
two 
moralities, 
and 
yet 
more 
often 
the 
interpenetration 
and 
mutual 
misunderstanding 
of 
both, 
and 
at 
times 
they 
occur 
directly 
alongside 
each 
other—even 
in 
the 
same 
human 
being, 
within 
a 
single 
soul.5 


The 
moral 
discrimination 
of 
values 
has 
originated 
either 
among 
a 
ruling 
group 
whose 
consciousness 
of 
its 
difference 
from 
the 
ruled 
group 
was 
accompanied 
by 
delight—or 
among 
the 
ruled, 
the 
slaves 
and 
dependents 
of 
every 
degree. 


In 
the 
first 
case, 
when 
the 
ruling 
group 
determines 
what 
is 
“good,” 
the 
exalted, 
proud 
states 
of 
the 
soul 
are 
experienced 
as 
conferring 
distinction 
and 
determining 
the 
order 
of 
rank. 
The 
noble 
human 
being 
separates 
from 
himself 
those 
in 
whom 
the 
opposite 
of 
such 
exalted, 
proud 
states 
finds 
expression: 
he 
despises 
them. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
immediately 
that 
in 
this 
first 
type 
of 
morality 
the 
opposition 
of 
“good” 
and 
“bad” 
means 
approximately 
the 
same 
as 
“noble” 
and 
“contemptible.” 
(The 
opposition 
of 
“good” 
and 
“evil” 
has 
a 
different 
origin.) 
One 
feels 
contempt 
for 
the 
cowardly, 
the 
anxious, 
the 
petty, 
those 
intent 
on 
narrow 
utility; 
also 
for 
the 
suspicious 
with 
their 
unfree 
glances, 
those 
who 
humble 
themselves, 
the 
doglike 
people 
who 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
maltreated, 
the 
begging 
flatterers, 
above 
all 
the 
liars: 
it 
is 
part 
of 
the 
fundamental 
faith 
of 
all 
aristocrats 
that 
the 
common 
people 
lie. 
“We 
truthful 
ones”— 
thus 
the 
nobility 
of 
ancient 
Greece 
referred 
to 
itself. 


It 
is 
obvious 
that 
moral 
designations 
were 
everywhere 
first 
applied 
to 
human 
beings 
and 
only 
later, 
derivatively, 
to 
actions. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
a 
gross 
mistake 
when 
historians 
of 
morality 
start 
from 
such 
questions 
as: 
why 
was 
the 
compassionate 
act 
praised? 
The 
noble 
type 
of 
man 
experiences 
itself 
as 



determining 
values; 
it 
does 
not 
need 
approval; 
it 
judges, 
“what 
is 
harmful 
to 
me 
is 
harmful 
in 
itself”; 
it 
knows 
itself 
to 
be 
that 
which 
first 
accords 
honor 
to 
things; 
it 
is 
value-creating. 
Everything 
it 
knows 
as 
part 
of 
itself 
it 
honors: 
such 
a 
morality 
is 
self-glorification. 
In 
the 
foreground 
there 
is 
the 
feeling 
of 
fullness, 
of 
power 
that 
seeks 
to 
overflow, 
the 
happiness 
of 
high 
tension, 
the 
consciousness 
of 
wealth 
that 
would 
give 
and 
bestow: 
the 
noble 
human 
being, 
too, 
helps 
the 
unfortunate, 
but 
not, 
or 
almost 
not, 
from 
pity, 
but 
prompted 
more 
by 
an 
urge 
begotten 
by 
excess 
of 
power. 
The 
noble 
human 
being 
honors 
himself 
as 
one 
who 
is 
powerful, 
also 
as 
one 
who 
has 
power 
over 
himself, 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
speak 
and 
be 
silent, 
who 
delights 
in 
being 
severe 
and 
hard 
with 
himself 
and 
respects 
all 
severity 
and 
hardness. 
“A 
hard 
heart 
Wotan 
put 
into 
my 
breast,” 
says 
an 
old 
Scandinavian 
saga: 
a 
fitting 
poetic 
expression, 
seeing 
that 
it 
comes 
from 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
proud 
Viking. 
Such 
a 
type 
of 
man 
is 
actually 
proud 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
is 
not 
made 
for 
pity, 
and 
the 
hero 
of 
the 
saga 
therefore 
adds 
as 
a 
warning: 
“If 
the 
heart 
is 
not 
hard 
in 
youth 
it 
will 
never 
harden.” 
Noble 
and 
courageous 
human 
beings 
who 
think 
that 
way 
are 
furthest 
removed 
from 
that 
morality 
which 
finds 
the 
distinction 
of 
morality 
precisely 
in 
pity, 
or 
in 
acting 
for 
others, 
or 
in 
désintéressement; 
faith 
in 
oneself, 
pride 
in 
oneself, 
a 
fundamental 
hostility 
and 
irony 
against 
“selflessness” 
belong 
just 
as 
definitely 
to 
noble 
morality 
as 
does 
a 
slight 
disdain 
and 
caution 
regarding 
compassionate 
feelings 
and 
a 
“warm 
heart.” 


It 
is 
the 
powerful 
who 
understand 
how 
to 
honor; 
this 
is 
their 
art, 
their 
realm 
of 
invention. 
The 
profound 
reverence 
for 
age 
and 
tradition—all 
law 
rests 
on 
this 
double 
reverence—the 
faith 
and 
prejudice 
in 
favor 
of 
ancestors 
and 
disfavor 
of 
those 
yet 
to 
come 
are 
typical 
of 
the 
morality 
of 
the 
powerful; 
and 
when 
the 
men 
of 
“modern 
ideas,” 
conversely, 
believe 
almost 
instinctively 
in 
“progress” 
and 
“the 
future” 
and 
more 
and 
more 
lack 
respect 
for 
age, 
this 
in 
itself 
would 
sufficiently 
betray 
the 
ignoble 
origin 
of 
these 
“ideas.” 


A 
morality 
of 
the 
ruling 
group, 
however, 
is 
most 
alien 
and 
embarrassing 
to 
the 
present 
taste 
in 
the 
severity 
of 
its 
principle 
that 
one 
has 
duties 
only 
to 
one’s 
peers; 
that 
against 
beings 
of 
a 
lower 
rank, 
against 
everything 
alien, 
one 
may 
behave 
as 
one 
pleases 
or 
“as 
the 
heart 
desires,” 
and 
in 
any 
case 
“beyond 
good 
and 
evil”— 
here 
pity 
and 
like 
feelings 
may 
find 
their 
place.6 


The 
capacity 
for, 
and 
the 
duty 
of, 
long 
gratitude 
and 
long 
revenge—both 
only 
among 
one’s 
peers—refinement 
in 
repaying, 
the 
sophisticated 
concept 
of 
friendship, 
a 
certain 
necessity 
for 
having 
enemies 
(as 
it 
were, 
as 
drainage 



ditches 
for 
the 
affects 
of 
envy, 
quarrelsomeness, 
exuberance—at 
bottom, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
being 
good 
friends): 
all 
these 
are 
typical 
characteristics 
of 
noble 
morality 
which, 
as 
suggested, 
is 
not 
the 
morality 
of 
“modern 
ideas” 
and 
therefore 
is 
hard 
to 
empathize 
with 
today, 
also 
hard 
to 
dig 
up 
and 
uncover.7 


It 
is 
different 
with 
the 
second 
type 
of 
morality, 
slave 
morality. 
Suppose 
the 
violated, 
oppressed, 
suffering, 
unfree, 
who 
are 
uncertain 
of 
themselves 
and 
weary, 
moralize: 
what 
will 
their 
moral 
valuations 
have 
in 
common? 
Probably, 
a 
pessimistic 
suspicion 
about 
the 
whole 
condition 
of 
man 
will 
find 
expression, 
perhaps 
a 
condemnation 
of 
man 
along 
with 
his 
condition. 
The 
slave’s 
eye 
is 
not 
favorable 
to 
the 
virtues 
of 
the 
powerful: 
he 
is 
skeptical 
and 
suspicious, 
subtly 
suspicious, 
of 
all 
the 
“good” 
that 
is 
honored 
there—he 
would 
like 
to 
persuade 
himself 
that 
even 
their 
happiness 
is 
not 
genuine. 
Conversely, 
those 
qualities 
are 
brought 
out 
and 
flooded 
with 
light 
which 
serve 
to 
ease 
existence 
for 
those 
who 
suffer: 
here 
pity, 
the 
complaisant 
and 
obliging 
hand, 
the 
warm 
heart, 
patience, 
industry, 
humility, 
and 
friendliness 
are 
honored—for 
here 
these 
are 
the 
most 
useful 
qualities 
and 
almost 
the 
only 
means 
for 
enduring 
the 
pressure 
of 
existence. 
Slave 
morality 
is 
essentially 
a 
morality 
of 
utility. 


Here 
is 
the 
place 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
that 
famous 
opposition 
of 
“good” 
and 
“evil”: 
into 
evil 
one’s 
feelings 
project 
power 
and 
dangerousness, 
a 
certain 
terribleness, 
subtlety, 
and 
strength 
that 
does 
not 
permit 
contempt 
to 
develop. 
According 
to 
slave 
morality, 
those 
who 
are 
“evil” 
thus 
inspire 
fear; 
according 
to 
master 
morality 
it 
is 
precisely 
those 
who 
are 
“good” 
that 
inspire, 
and 
wish 
to 
inspire, 
fear, 
while 
the 
“bad” 
are 
felt 
to 
be 
contemptible. 


The 
opposition 
reaches 
its 
climax 
when, 
as 
a 
logical 
consequence 
of 
slave 
morality, 
a 
touch 
of 
disdain 
is 
associated 
also 
with 
the 
“good” 
of 
this 
morality—this 
may 
be 
slight 
and 
benevolent—because 
the 
good 
human 
being 
has 
to 
be 
undangerous 
in 
the 
slaves’ 
way 
of 
thinking: 
he 
is 
good-natured, 
easy 
to 
deceive, 
a 
little 
stupid 
perhaps, 
un 
bonhomme.8 


Wherever 
slave 
morality 
becomes 
preponderant, 
language 
tends 
to 
bring 
the 
words 
“good” 
and 
“stupid” 
closer 
together. 


One 
last 
fundamental 
difference: 
the 
longing 
for 
freedom, 
the 
instinct 
for 
happiness 
and 
the 
subtleties 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
freedom 
belong 
just 
as 
necessarily 
to 
slave 
morality 
and 
morals 
as 
artful 
and 
enthusiastic 
reverence 
and 
devotion 
are 
the 
regular 
symptom 
of 
an 
aristocratic 
way 
of 
thinking 
and 
evaluating. 



This 
makes 
plain 
why 
love 
as 
passion—which 
is 
our 
European 
specialty— 
simply 
must 
be 
of 
noble 
origin: 
as 
is 
well 
known, 
its 
invention 
must 
be 
credited 
to 
the 
Provençal 
knight-poets, 
those 
magnificent 
and 
inventive 
human 
beings 
of 
the 
“gai 
saber”9 
to 
whom 
Europe 
owes 
so 
many 
things 
and 
almost 
owes 
itself.— 



261 


Among 
the 
things 
that 
may 
be 
hardest 
to 
understand 
for 
a 
noble 
human 
being 
is 
vanity: 
he 
will 
be 
tempted 
to 
deny 
it, 
where 
another 
type 
of 
human 
being 
could 
not 
find 
it 
more 
palpable. 
The 
problem 
for 
him 
is 
to 
imagine 
people 
who 
seek 
to 
create 
a 
good 
opinion 
of 
themselves 
which 
they 
do 
not 
have 
of 
themselves—and 
thus 
also 
do 
not 
“deserve”—and 
who 
nevertheless 
end 
up 
believing 
this 
good 
opinion 
themselves. 
This 
strikes 
him 
half 
as 
such 
bad 
taste 
and 
lack 
of 
self-respect, 
and 
half 
as 
so 
baroquely 
irrational, 
that 
he 
would 
like 
to 
consider 
vanity 
as 
exceptional, 
and 
in 
most 
cases 
when 
it 
is 
spoken 
of 
he 
doubts 
it. 


He 
will 
say, 
for 
example: 
“I 
may 
be 
mistaken 
about 
my 
value 
and 
nevertheless 
demand 
that 
my 
value, 
exactly 
as 
I 
define 
it, 
should 
be 
acknowledged 
by 
others 
as 
well—but 
this 
is 
no 
vanity 
(but 
conceit 
or, 
more 
frequently, 
what 
is 
called 
‘humility’ 
or 
‘modesty’).” 
Or: 
“For 
many 
reasons 
I 
may 
take 
pleasure 
in 
the 
good 
opinion 
of 
others: 
perhaps 
because 
I 
honor 
and 
love 
them 
and 
all 
their 
pleasures 
give 
me 
pleasure; 
perhaps 
also 
because 
their 
good 
opinion 
confirms 
and 
strengthens 
my 
faith 
in 
my 
own 
good 
opinion; 
perhaps 
because 
the 
good 
opinion 
of 
others, 
even 
in 
cases 
where 
I 
do 
not 
share 
it, 
is 
still 
useful 
to 
me 
or 
promises 
to 
become 
so—but 
all 
that 
is 
not 
vanity.” 


The 
noble 
human 
being 
must 
force 
himself, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
history, 
to 
recognize 
that, 
since 
time 
immemorial, 
in 
all 
somehow 
dependent 
social 
strata 
the 
common 
man 
was 
only 
what 
he 
was 
considered: 
not 
at 
all 
used 
to 
positing 
values 
himself, 
he 
also 
attached 
no 
other 
value 
to 
himself 
than 
his 
masters 
attached 
to 
him 
(it 
is 
the 
characteristic 
right 
of 
masters 
to 
create 
values). 


It 
may 
be 
understood 
as 
the 
consequence 
of 
an 
immense 
atavism 
that 
even 
now 
the 
ordinary 
man 
still 
always 
waits 
for 
an 
opinion 
about 
himself 
and 
then 
instinctively 
submits 
to 
that—but 
by 
no 
means 
only 
a 
“good” 
opinion; 
also 
a 
bad 
and 
unfair 
one 
(consider, 
for 
example, 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
the 
self-estimates 
and 
self-underestimates 
that 
believing 
women 
accept 
from 
their 
father-confessors, 
and 
believing 
Christians 
quite 
generally 
from 
their 
church). 


In 
accordance 
with 
the 
slowly 
arising 
democratic 
order 
of 
things 
(and 
its 



cause, 
the 
intermarriage 
of 
masters 
and 
slaves), 
the 
originally 
noble 
and 
rare 
urge 
to 
ascribe 
value 
to 
oneself 
on 
one’s 
own 
and 
to 
“think 
well” 
of 
oneself 
will 
actually 
be 
encouraged 
and 
spread 
more 
and 
more 
now; 
but 
it 
is 
always 
opposed 
by 
an 
older, 
ampler, 
and 
more 
deeply 
ingrained 
propensity—and 
in 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
“vanity” 
this 
older 
propensity 
masters 
the 
younger 
one. 
The 
vain 
person 
is 
delighted 
by 
every 
good 
opinion 
he 
hears 
of 
himself 
(quite 
apart 
from 
all 
considerations 
of 
its 
utility, 
and 
also 
apart 
from 
truth 
or 
falsehood), 
just 
as 
every 
bad 
opinion 
of 
him 
pains 
him: 
for 
he 
submits 
to 
both, 
he 
feels 
subjected 
to 
them 
in 
accordance 
with 
that 
oldest 
instinct 
of 
submission 
that 
breaks 
out 
in 
him. 


It 
is 
“the 
slave” 
in 
the 
blood 
of 
the 
vain 
person, 
a 
residue 
of 
the 
slave’s 
craftiness—and 
how 
much 
“slave” 
is 
still 
residual 
in 
woman, 
for 
example!— 
that 
seeks 
to 
seduce 
him 
to 
good 
opinions 
about 
himself; 
it 
is 
also 
the 
slave 
who 
afterwards 
immediately 
prostrates 
himself 
before 
these 
opinions 
as 
if 
he 
had 
not 
called 
them 
forth. 


And 
to 
say 
it 
once 
more: 
vanity 
is 
an 
atavism. 



262 


A 
species10 
comes 
to 
be, 
a 
type 
becomes 
fixed 
and 
strong, 
through 
the 
long 
fight 
with 
essentially 
constant 
unfavorable 
conditions. 
Conversely, 
we 
know 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
breeders11 
that 
species 
accorded 
superabundant 
nourishment 
and 
quite 
generally 
extra 
protection 
and 
care 
soon 
tend 
most 
strongly 
toward 
variations 
of 
the 
type 
and 
become 
rich 
in 
marvels 
and 
monstrosities 
(including 
monstrous 
vices). 


Now 
look 
for 
once 
at 
an 
aristocratic 
commonwealth—say, 
an 
ancient 
Greek 
polis,12 
or 
Venice—as 
an 
arrangement, 
whether 
voluntary 
or 
involuntary, 
for 
breeding:13 
human 
beings 
are 
together 
there 
who 
are 
dependent 
on 
themselves 
and 
want 
their 
species 
to 
prevail, 
most 
often 
because 
they 
have 
to 
prevail 
or 
run 
the 
terrible 
risk 
of 
being 
exterminated. 
Here 
that 
boon, 
that 
excess, 
and 
that 
protection 
which 
favor 
variations 
are 
lacking; 
the 
species 
needs 
itself 
as 
a 
species, 
as 
something 
that 
can 
prevail 
and 
make 
itself 
durable 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
very 
hardness, 
uniformity, 
and 
simplicity 
of 
form, 
in 
a 
constant 
fight 
with 
its 
neighbors 
or 
with 
the 
oppressed 
who 
are 
rebellious 
or 
threaten 
rebellion. 
Manifold 
experience 
teaches 
them 
to 
which 
qualities 
above 
all 
they 
owe 
the 
fact 
that, 
despite 
all 
gods 
and 
men, 
they 
are 
still 
there, 
that 
they 
have 
always 
triumphed: 
these 
qualities 
they 
call 
virtues, 
these 
virtues 
alone 
they 
cultivate.14 


They 
do 
this 
with 
hardness, 
indeed 
they 
want 
hardness; 
every 
aristocratic 
morality 
is 
intolerant—in 
the 
education 
of 
youth, 
in 
their 
arrangements 
for 
women, 
in 
their 
marriage 
customs, 
in 
the 
relations 
of 
old 
and 
young, 
in 
their 
penal 
laws 
(which 
take 
into 
account 
deviants 
only)—they 
consider 
intolerance 
itself 
a 
virtue, 
calling 
it 
“justice.” 


In 
this 
way 
a 
type 
with 
few 
but 
very 
strong 
traits, 
a 
species 
of 
severe, 
warlike, 
prudently 
taciturn 
men, 
close-mouthed 
and 
closely 
linked 
(and 
as 
such 
possessed 
of 
the 
subtlest 
feeling 
for 
the 
charms 
and 
nuances 
of 
association), 
is 
fixed 
beyond 
the 
changing 
generations; 
the 
continual 
fight 
against 
ever 
constant 
unfavorable 
conditions 
is, 
as 
mentioned 
previously, 
the 
cause 
that 
fixes 
and 
hardens 
a 
type. 


Eventually, 
however, 
a 
day 
arrives 
when 
conditions 
become 
more 



fortunate 
and 
the 
tremendous 
tension 
decreases; 
perhaps 
there 
are 
no 
longer 
any 
enemies 
among 
one’s 
neighbors, 
and 
the 
means 
of 
life, 
even 
for 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
life, 
are 
superabundant. 
At 
one 
stroke 
the 
bond 
and 
constraint 
of 
the 
old 
discipline15 
are 
torn: 
it 
no 
longer 
seems 
necessary, 
a 
condition 
of 
existence—if 
it 
persisted 
it 
would 
only 
be 
a 
form 
of 
luxury, 
an 
archaizing 
taste. 
Variation, 
whether 
as 
deviation 
(to 
something 
higher, 
subtler, 
rarer) 
or 
as 
degeneration 
and 
monstrosity, 
suddenly 
appears 
on 
the 
scene 
in 
the 
greatest 
abundance 
and 
magnificence; 
the 
individual 
dares 
to 
be 
individual 
and 
different. 


At 
these 
turning 
points 
of 
history 
we 
behold 
beside 
one 
another, 
and 
often 
mutually 
involved 
and 
entangled, 
a 
splendid, 
manifold, 
junglelike 
growth 
and 
upward 
striving, 
a 
kind 
of 
tropical 
tempo 
in 
the 
competition 
to 
grow, 
and 
a 
tremendous 
ruin 
and 
self-ruination, 
as 
the 
savage 
egoisms 
that 
have 
turned, 
almost 
exploded, 
against 
one 
another 
wrestle 
“for 
sun 
and 
light” 
and 
can 
no 
longer 
derive 
any 
limit, 
restraint, 
or 
consideration 
from 
their 
previous16 
morality. 
It 
was 
this 
morality 
itself 
that 
dammed 
up 
such 
enormous 
strength 
and 
bent 
the 
bow 
in 
such 
a 
threatening 
manner; 
now 
it 
is 
“outlived.” 
The 
dangerous 
and 
uncanny 
point 
has 
been 
reached 
where 
the 
greater, 
more 
manifold, 
more 
comprehensive 
life 
transcends 
and 
lives 
beyond 
the 
old 
morality; 
the 
“individual” 
appears, 
obliged 
to 
give 
himself 
laws 
and 
to 
develop 
his 
own 
arts 
and 
wiles 
for 
self-preservation, 
self-enhancement, 
self-
redemption. 


All 
sorts 
of 
new 
what-fors 
and 
wherewithals; 
no 
shared 
formulas 
any 
longer; 
misunderstanding 
allied 
with 
disrespect; 
decay, 
corruption, 
and 
the 
highest 
desires 
gruesomely 
entangled; 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
race 
overflowing 
from 
all 
cornucopias 
of 
good 
and 
bad; 
a 
calamitous 
simultaneity 
of 
spring 
and 
fall, 
full 
of 
new 
charms 
and 
veils 
that 
characterize 
young, 
still 
unexhausted, 
still 
unwearied 
corruption. 
Again 
danger 
is 
there, 
the 
mother 
of 
morals, 
great 
danger, 
this 
time 
transposed 
into 
the 
individual, 
into 
the 
neighbor 
and 
friend, 
into 
the 
alley, 
into 
one’s 
own 
child, 
into 
one’s 
own 
heart, 
into 
the 
most 
personal 
and 
secret 
recesses 
of 
wish 
and 
will: 
what 
may 
the 
moral 
philosophers 
emerging 
in 
this 
age 
have 
to 
preach 
now? 


These 
acute 
observers 
and 
loiterers 
discover 
that 
the 
end 
is 
approaching 
fast, 
that 
everything 
around 
them 
is 
corrupted 
and 
corrupts, 
that 
nothing 
will 
stand 
the 
day 
after 
tomorrow, 
except 
one 
type 
of 
man, 
the 
incurably 
mediocre. 
The 
mediocre 
alone 
have 
a 
chance 
of 
continuing 
their 
type 
and 
propagating—they 
are 
the 
men 
of 
the 
future, 
the 
only 
survivors: 
“Be 
like 



them! 
Become 
mediocre!” 
is 
now 
the 
only 
morality 
that 
still 
makes 
sense, 
that 
still 
gets 
a 
hearing. 


But 
this 
morality 
of 
mediocrity 
is 
hard 
to 
preach: 
after 
all, 
it 
may 
never 
admit 
what 
it 
is 
and 
what 
it 
wants. 
It 
must 
speak 
of 
measure 
and 
dignity 
and 
duty 
and 
neighbor 
love—it 
will 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
conceal 
its 
irony.— 



263 


There 
is 
an 
instinct 
for 
rank 
which, 
more 
than 
anything 
else, 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
a 
high 
rank; 
there 
is 
a 
delight 
in 
the 
nuances 
of 
reverence 
that 
allows 
us 
to 
infer 
noble 
origin 
and 
habits. 
The 
refinement, 
graciousness, 
and 
height 
of 
a 
soul 
is 
tested 
dangerously 
when 
something 
of 
the 
first 
rank 
passes 
by 
without 
being 
as 
yet 
protected 
by 
the 
shudders 
of 
authority 
against 
obtrusive 
efforts 
and 
ineptitudes—something 
that 
goes 
its 
way 
unmarked, 
undiscovered, 
tempting, 
perhaps 
capriciously 
concealed 
and 
disguised, 
like 
a 
living 
touchstone. 
Anyone 
to 
whose 
task 
and 
practice 
it 
belongs 
to 
search 
out 
souls 
will 
employ 
this 
very 
art 
in 
many 
forms 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
the 
ultimate 
value 
of 
a 
soul 
and 
the 
unalterable, 
innate 
order 
of 
rank 
to 
which 
it 
belongs: 
he 
will 
test 
it 
for 
its 
instinct 
of 
reverence. 


Différence 
engendre 
haine:17 
the 
baseness 
of 
some 
people 
suddenly 
spurts 
up 
like 
dirty 
water 
when 
some 
holy 
vessel, 
some 
precious 
thing 
from 
a 
locked 
shrine, 
some 
book 
with 
the 
marks 
of 
a 
great 
destiny, 
is 
carried 
past; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
is 
a 
reflex 
of 
silence, 
a 
hesitation 
of 
the 
eye, 
a 
cessation 
of 
all 
gestures 
that 
express 
how 
a 
soul 
feels 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
most 
venerable. 
The 
way 
in 
which 
reverence 
for 
the 
Bible 
has 
on 
the 
whole 
been 
maintained 
so 
far 
in 
Europe 
is 
perhaps 
the 
best 
bit 
of 
discipline 
and 
refinement 
of 
manners 
that 
Europe 
owes 
to 
Christianity: 
such 
books 
of 
profundity 
and 
ultimate 
significance 
require 
some 
external 
tyranny 
of 
authority 
for 
their 
protection 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
those 
millennia 
of 
persistence 
which 
are 
necessary 
to 
exhaust 
them 
and 
figure 
them 
out. 


Much 
is 
gained 
once 
the 
feeling 
has 
finally 
been 
cultivated 
in 
the 
masses 
(among 
the 
shallow 
and 
in 
the 
high-speed 
intestines 
of 
every 
kind) 
that 
they 
are 
not 
to 
touch 
everything; 
that 
there 
are 
holy 
experiences 
before 
which 
they 
have 
to 
take 
off 
their 
shoes 
and 
keep 
away 
their 
unclean 
hands—this 
is 
almost 
their 
greatest 
advance 
toward 
humanity. 
Conversely, 
perhaps 
there 
is 
nothing 
about 
so-called 
educated 
people 
and 
believers 
in 
“modern 
ideas” 
that 
is 
as 
nauseous 
as 
their 
lack 
of 
modesty 
and 
the 
comfortable 
insolence 
of 
their 
eyes 
and 
hands 
with 
which 
they 
touch, 
lick, 
and 
finger 
everything; 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
even 
among 
the 
common 
people, 
among 
the 
less 
educated, 



especially 
among 
peasants, 
one 
finds 
today 
more 
relative 
nobility 
of 
taste 
and 
tactful 
reverence 
than 
among 
the 
newspaper-reading 
demi-monde 
of 
the 
spirit, 
the 
educated. 



264 


One 
cannot 
erase 
from 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
human 
being 
what 
his 
ancestors 
liked 
most 
to 
do 
and 
did 
most 
constantly: 
whether 
they 
were, 
for 
example, 
assiduous 
savers 
and 
appurtenances 
of 
a 
desk 
and 
cash 
box, 
modest 
and 
bourgeois 
in 
their 
desires, 
modest 
also 
in 
their 
virtues; 
or 
whether 
they 
lived 
accustomed 
to 
commanding 
from 
dawn 
to 
dusk, 
fond 
of 
rough 
amusements 
and 
also 
perhaps 
of 
even 
rougher 
duties 
and 
responsibilities; 
or 
whether, 
finally, 
at 
some 
point 
they 
sacrificed 
ancient 
prerogatives 
of 
birth 
and 
possessions 
in 
order 
to 
live 
entirely 
for 
their 
faith—their 
“god”—as 
men 
of 
an 
inexorable 
and 
delicate 
conscience 
which 
blushes 
at 
every 
compromise. 
It 
is 
simply 
not 
possible 
that 
a 
human 
being 
should 
not 
have 
the 
qualities 
and 
preferences 
of 
his 
parents 
and 
ancestors 
in 
his 
body, 
whatever 
appearances 
may 
suggest 
to 
the 
contrary. 
This 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
race.18 


If 
one 
knows 
something 
about 
the 
parents, 
an 
inference 
about 
the 
child 
is 
permissible: 
any 
disgusting 
incontinence, 
any 
nook 
envy, 
a 
clumsy 
insistence 
that 
one 
is 
always 
right—these 
three 
things 
together 
have 
always 
constituted 
the 
characteristic 
type 
of 
the 
plebeian—that 
sort 
of 
thing 
must 
as 
surely 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
child 
as 
corrupted 
blood; 
and 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
best 
education 
one 
will 
at 
best 
deceive 
with 
regard 
to 
such 
a 
heredity. 


And 
what 
else 
is 
the 
aim 
of 
education 
and 
“culture” 
today? 
In 
our 
very 
popularity-minded—that 
is, 
plebeian—age, 
“education” 
and 
“culture” 
have 
to 
be 
essentially 
the 
art 
of 
deceiving—about 
one’s 
origins, 
the 
inherited 
plebs 
in 
one’s 
body 
and 
soul. 
An 
educator 
who 
today 
preached 
truthfulness 
above 
all 
and 
constantly 
challenged 
his 
students, 
“be 
true! 
be 
natural! 
do 
not 
pretend!”—even 
such 
a 
virtuous 
and 
guileless 
ass 
would 
learn 
after 
a 
while 
to 
reach 
for 
that 
furca 
of 
Horace 
to 
naturam 
expeliere: 
with 
what 
success? 
“Plebs” 
usque 
recurret.19— 



265 


At 
the 
risk 
of 
displeasing 
innocent 
ears 
I 
propose: 
egoism 
belongs 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
noble 
soul—I 
mean 
that 
unshakable 
faith 
that 
to 
a 
being 
such 
as 
“we 
are” 
other 
beings 
must 
be 
subordinate 
by 
nature 
and 
have 
to 
sacrifice 
themselves. 
The 
noble 
soul 
accepts 
this 
fact 
of 
its 
egoism 
without 
any 
question 
mark, 
also 
without 
any 
feeling 
that 
it 
might 
contain 
hardness, 
constraint, 
or 
caprice, 
rather 
as 
something 
that 
may 
be 
founded 
in 
the 
primordial 
law 
of 
things: 
if 
it 
sought 
a 
name 
for 
this 
fact 
it 
would 
say, 
“it 
is 
justice 
itself.” 
Perhaps 
it 
admits 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
that 
at 
first 
make 
it 
hesitate 
that 
there 
are 
some 
who 
have 
rights 
equal 
to 
its 
own; 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
matter 
of 
rank 
is 
settled 
it 
moves 
among 
these 
equals 
with 
their 
equal 
privileges, 
showing 
the 
same 
sureness 
of 
modesty 
and 
delicate 
reverence 
that 
characterize 
its 
relations 
with 
itself—in 
accordance 
with 
an 
innate 
heavenly 
mechanism 
understood 
by 
all 
stars. 
It 
is 
merely 
another 
aspect 
of 
its 
egoism, 
this 
refinement 
and 
self-limitation 
in 
its 
relations 
with 
its 
equals—every 
star 
is 
such 
an 
egoist—it 
honors 
itself 
in 
them 
and 
in 
the 
rights 
it 
cedes 
to 
them; 
it 
does 
not 
doubt 
that 
the 
exchange 
of 
honors 
and 
rights 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
all 
social 
relations 
and 
thus 
also 
belongs 
to 
the 
natural 
condition 
of 
things. 


The 
noble 
soul 
gives 
as 
it 
takes, 
from 
that 
passionate 
and 
irritable 
instinct 
of 
repayment 
that 
lies 
in 
its 
depth. 
The 
concept 
“grace”20 
has 
no 
meaning 
or 
good 
odor 
inter 
pares;21 
there 
may 
be 
a 
sublime 
way 
of 
letting 
presents 
from 
above 
happen 
to 
one, 
as 
it 
were, 
and 
to 
drink 
them 
up 
thirstily 
like 
drops— 
but 
for 
this 
art 
and 
gesture 
the 
noble 
soul 
has 
no 
aptitude. 
Its 
egoism 
hinders 
it: 
quite 
generally 
it 
does 
not 
like 
to 
look 
“up”—but 
either 
ahead, 
horizontally 
and 
slowly, 
or 
down: 
it 
knows 
itself 
to 
be 
at 
a 
height.

“Truly 
high 
respect 
one 
can 
have 
only 
for 
those 
who 
do 
not 
seek 
themselves.”—Goethe 
to 
Rat 
Schlosser.

The 
Chinese 
have 
a 
proverb 
that 
mothers 
even 
teach 
children: 
siao-sin 
—“make 
your 
heart 
small!” 
This 
is 
the 
characteristic 
fundamental 
propensity 
in 
late 
civilizations: 
I 
do 
not 
doubt 
that 
an 
ancient 
Greek 
would 
recognize 
in 
us 
Europeans 
of 
today, 
too, 
such 
self-diminution; 
this 
alone 
would 
suffice 
for 
us 
to 
“offend 
his 
taste.”— 



268 


What, 
in 
the 
end, 
is 
common?22 


Words 
are 
acoustical 
signs 
for 
concepts; 
concepts, 
however, 
are 
more 
or 
less 
definite 
image 
signs 
for 
often 
recurring 
and 
associated 
sensations, 
for 
groups 
of 
sensations. 
To 
understand 
one 
another, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
that 
one 
use 
the 
same 
words; 
one 
also 
has 
to 
use 
the 
same 
words 
for 
the 
same 
species 
of 
inner 
experiences; 
in 
the 
end 
one 
has 
to 
have 
one’s 
experience 
in 
common. 


Therefore 
the 
human 
beings 
of 
one 
people 
understand 
one 
another 
better 
than 
those 
belonging 
to 
different 
peoples 
even 
if 
they 
employ 
the 
same 
language; 
or 
rather 
when 
human 
beings 
have 
long 
lived 
together 
under 
similar 
conditions 
(of 
climate, 
soil, 
danger, 
needs, 
and 
work), 
what 
results23 
from 
this 
is 
people 
who 
“understand24 
one 
another”—a 
people. 
In 
all 
souls 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
often 
recurring 
experiences 
has 
come 
to 
be 
predominant 
over 
experiences 
that 
come 
more 
rarely: 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
former 
one 
understands 
the 
other, 
quickly 
and 
ever 
more 
quickly—the 
history 
of 
language 
is 
the 
history 
of 
a 
process 
of 
abbreviation—and 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
quick 
understanding 
one 
associates, 
ever 
more 
closely. 


The 
greater 
the 
danger 
is, 
the 
greater 
is 
the 
need 
to 
reach 
agreement 
quickly 
and 
easily 
about 
what 
must 
be 
done; 
not 
misunderstanding 
one 
another 
in 
times 
of 
danger 
is 
what 
human 
beings 
simply 
cannot 
do 
without 
in 
their 
relations. 
In 
every 
friendship 
or 
love 
affair 
one 
still 
makes 
this 
test: 
nothing 
of 
that 
sort 
can 
endure 
once 
one 
discovers 
that 
one’s 
partner 
associates 
different 
feelings, 
intentions, 
nuances, 
desires, 
and 
fears 
with 
the 
same 
words. 
(Fear 
of 
the 
“eternal 
misunderstanding”—that 
is 
the 
benevolent 
genius 
which 
so 
often 
keeps 
persons 
of 
different 
sex 
from 
rash 
attachments 
to 
which 
their 
senses 
and 
hearts 
prompt 
them—this 
and 
not 
some 
Schppenhauerian 
“genius 
of 
the 
species”!) 


Which 
group 
of 
sensations 
is 
aroused, 
expresses 
itself, 
and 
issues 
commands 
in 
a 
soul 
most 
quickly, 
is 
decisive 
for 
the 
whole 
order 
of 
rank 
of 
its 
values 
and 
ultimately 
determines 
its 
table 
of 
goods. 
The 
values 
of 
a 
human 
being 
betray 
something 
of 
the 
structure 
of 
his 
soul 
and 
where 
it 
finds 
its 
conditions 
of 
life, 
its 
true 
need. 



Assuming 
next 
that 
need 
has 
ever 
brought 
close 
to 
one 
another 
only 
such 
human 
beings 
as 
could 
suggest 
with 
similar 
signs 
similar 
requirements 
and 
experiences, 
it 
would 
follow 
on 
the 
whole 
that 
easy 
communicability 
of 
need 
—which 
in 
the 
last 
analysis 
means 
the 
experience 
of 
merely 
average 
and 
common 
experiences—must 
have 
been 
the 
most 
powerful 
of 
all 
powers 
at 
whose 
disposal 
man 
has 
been 
so 
far. 
The 
human 
beings 
who 
are 
more 
similar, 
more 
ordinary, 
have 
had, 
and 
always 
have, 
an 
advantage; 
those 
more 
select, 
subtle, 
strange, 
and 
difficult 
to 
understand, 
easily 
remain 
alone, 
succumb 
to 
accidents, 
being 
isolated, 
and 
rarely 
propagate. 
One 
must 
invoke 
tremendous 
counter-forces 
in 
order 
to 
cross 
this 
natural, 
all 
too 
natural 
progressus 
in 
simile, 
the 
continual 
development 
of 
man 
toward 
the 
similar, 
ordinary, 
average, 
herdlike—common! 



269 


The 
more 
a 
psychologist—a 
born 
and 
inevitable 
psychologist 
and 
unriddler 
of 
souls—applies 
himself 
to 
the 
more 
exquisite 
cases 
and 
human 
beings, 
the 
greater 
becomes 
the 
danger 
that 
he 
might 
suffocate 
from 
pity.25 


He 
needs 
hardness 
and 
cheerfulness 
more 
than 
anyone 
else. 
For 
the 
corruption, 
the 
ruination 
of 
the 
higher 
men, 
of 
the 
souls 
of 
a 
stranger 
type, 
is 
the 
rule: 
it 
is 
terrible 
to 
have 
such 
a 
rule 
always 
before 
one’s 
eyes. 
The 
manifold 
torture 
of 
the 
psychologist 
who 
has 
discovered 
this 
ruination, 
who 
discovers 
this 
whole 
inner 
hopelessness 
of 
the 
higher 
man, 
this 
eternal 
“too 
late” 
in 
every 
sense, 
first 
in 
one 
case 
and 
then 
almost 
always 
through 
the 
whole 
of 
history—may 
perhaps 
lead 
him 
one 
day 
to 
turn 
against 
his 
own 
lot, 
embittered, 
and 
to 
make 
an 
attempt 
at 
self-destruction—may 
lead 
to 
his 
own 
“corruption.” 


In 
almost 
every 
psychologist 
one 
will 
perceive 
a 
telltale 
preference 
for 
and 
delight 
in 
association 
with 
everyday, 
well-ordered 
people: 
this 
reveals 
that 
he 
always 
requires 
a 
cure, 
that 
he 
needs 
a 
kind 
of 
escape 
and 
forgetting, 
away 
from 
all 
that 
with 
which 
his 
insights, 
his 
incisions, 
his 
“craft” 
have 
burdened 
his 
conscience. 
He 
is 
characterized 
by 
fear 
of 
his 
memory. 
He 
is 
easily 
silenced 
by 
the 
judgments 
of 
others; 
he 
listens 
with 
an 
immobile 
face 
as 
they 
venerate, 
admire, 
love, 
and 
transfigure 
where 
he 
has 
seen—or 
he 
even 
conceals 
his 
silence 
by 
expressly 
agreeing 
with 
some 
foreground 
opinion. 
Perhaps 
the 
paradox 
of 
his 
situation 
is 
so 
gruesome 
that 
precisely 
where 
he 
has 
learned 
the 
greatest 
pity 
coupled 
with 
the 
greatest 
contempt, 
the 
crowd, 
the 
educated, 
the 
enthusiasts 
learn 
the 
greatest 
veneration—the 
veneration 
for 
“great 
men” 
and 
prodigies 
for 
whose 
sake 
one 
blesses 
and 
honors 
the 
fatherland, 
the 
earth, 
the 
dignity 
of 
humanity, 
and 
oneself, 
and 
to 
whom 
one 
refers 
the 
young, 
toward 
whom 
one 
educates 
them— 


And 
who 
knows 
whether 
what 
happened 
in 
all 
great 
cases 
so 
far 
was 
not 
always 
the 
same: 
that 
the 
crowd 
adored 
a 
god—and 
that 
the 
“god” 
was 
merely 
a 
poor 
sacrificial 
animal. 
Success 
has 
always 
been 
the 
greatest 
liar— 
and 
the 
“work” 
itself 
is 
a 
success; 
the 
great 
statesman, 
the 
conqueror, 
the 
discoverer 
is 
disguised 
by 
his 
creations, 
often 
beyond 
recognition; 
the 



“work,” 
whether 
of 
the 
artist 
or 
the 
philosopher, 
invents 
the 
man 
who 
has 
created 
it, 
who 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
created 
it; 
“great 
men,” 
as 
they 
are 
venerated, 
are 
subsequent 
pieces 
of 
wretched 
minor 
fiction; 
in 
the 
world 
of 
historical 
values, 
counterfeit 
rules. 


Those 
great 
poets, 
for 
example—men 
like 
Byron, 
Musset, 
Poe, 
Leopardi, 
Kleist, 
Gogol 
(I 
do 
not 
dare 
mention 
greater 
names, 
but 
I 
mean 
them)26 


—are 
and 
perhaps 
must 
be 
men 
of 
fleeting 
moments, 
enthusiastic, 
sensual, 
childish, 
frivolous 
and 
sudden 
in 
mistrust 
and 
trust; 
with 
souls 
in 
which 
they 
usually 
try 
to 
conceal 
some 
fracture; 
often 
taking 
revenge 
with 
their 
works 
for 
some 
inner 
contamination, 
often 
seeking 
with 
their 
high 
flights 
to 
escape 
into 
forgetfulness 
from 
an 
all-too-faithful 
memory; 
often 
lost 
in 
the 
mud 
and 
almost 
in 
love 
with 
it, 
until 
they 
become 
like 
the 
will-o’-the-wisps 
around 
swamps 
and 
pose 
as 
stars—the 
people 
may 
then 
call 
them 
idealists—often 
fighting 
against 
a 
long 
nausea, 
with 
a 
recurring 
specter 
of 
unbelief 
that 
chills 
and 
forces 
them 
to 
languish 
for 
gloria 
and 
to 
gobble 
their 
“belief 
in 
themselves” 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
intoxicated 
flatterers—what 
torture 
are 
these 
great 
artists 
and 
all 
the 
so-called 
higher 
men 
for 
anyone 
who 
has 
once 
guessed 
their 
true 
nature!27 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
that 
these 
men 
should 
so 
readily 
receive 
from 
woman—clairvoyant 
in 
the 
world 
of 
suffering 
and, 
unfortunately, 
also 
desirous 
far 
beyond 
her 
strength 
to 
help 
and 
save—those 
eruptions 
of 
boundless 
and 
most 
devoted 
pity 
which 
the 
multitude, 
above 
all 
the 
venerating 
multitude, 
does 
not 
understand 
and 
on 
which 
it 
lavishes 
inquisitive 
and 
self-satisfied 
interpretations. 
This 
pity 
deceives 
itself 
regularly 
about 
its 
powers; 
woman 
would 
like 
to 
believe 
that 
love 
can 
achieve 
anything—that 
is 
her 
characteristic 
faith. 
Alas, 
whoever 
knows 
the 
heart 
will 
guess 
how 
poor, 
stupid, 
helpless, 
arrogant, 
blundering, 
more 
apt 
to 
destroy 
than 
to 
save 
is 
even 
the 
best 
and 
profoundest 
love! 


It 
is 
possible 
that 
underneath 
the 
holy 
fable 
and 
disguise 
of 
Jesus’ 
life 
there 
lies 
concealed 
one 
of 
the 
most 
painful 
cases 
of 
the 
martyrdom 
of 
knowledge 
about 
love: 
the 
martyrdom 
of 
the 
most 
innocent 
and 
desirous 
heart, 
never 
sated 
by 
any 
human 
love; 
demanding 
love, 
to 
be 
loved 
and 
nothing 
else, 
with 
hardness, 
with 
insanity, 
with 
terrible 
eruptions 
against 
those 
who 
denied 
him 
love; 
the 
story 
of 
a 
poor 
fellow, 
unsated 
and 
insatiable 
in 
love, 
who 
had 
to 
invent 
hell 
in 
order 
to 
send 
to 
it 
those 
who 
did 
not 
want 
to 
love 
him—and 
who 
finally, 
having 
gained 
kowledge 
about 
human 
love, 
had 
to 
invent 
a 
god 
who 
is 
all 
love, 
all 
ability 
to 
love—who 
has 
mercy 
on 
human 
love 
because 
it 



is 
so 
utterly 
wretched 
and 
unknowing. 
Anyone 
who 
feels 
that 
way, 
who 
knows 
this 
about 
love—seeks 
death. 


But 
why 
pursue 
such 
painful 
matters? 
Assuming 
one 
does 
not 
have 
to.— 



270 


The 
spiritual 
haughtiness 
and 
nausea 
of 
every 
man 
who 
has 
suffered 
profoundly—it 
almost 
determines 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
how 
profoundly 
human 
beings 
can 
suffer—his 
shuddering 
certainty, 
which 
permeates 
and 
colors 
him 
through 
and 
through, 
that 
by 
virtue 
of 
his 
suffering 
he 
knows 
more 
than 
the 
cleverest 
and 
wisest 
could 
possibly 
know, 
and 
that 
he 
knows 
his 
way 
and 
has 
once 
been 
“at 
home” 
in 
many 
distant, 
terrifying 
worlds 
of 
which 
“you 
know 
nothing”—this 
spiritual 
and 
silent 
haughtiness 
of 
the 
sufferer, 
this 
pride 
of 
the 
elect 
of 
knowledge, 
of 
the 
“initiated,” 
of 
the 
almost 
sacrificed, 
finds 
all 
kinds 
of 
disguises 
necessary 
to 
protect 
itself 
against 
contact 
with 
obtrusive 
and 
pitying 
hands 
and 
altogether 
against 
everything 
that 
is 
not 
its 
equal 
in 
suffering. 
Profound 
suffering 
makes 
noble; 
it 
separates. 


One 
of 
the 
most 
refined 
disguises 
is 
Epicureanism, 
and 
a 
certain 
ostentatious 
courage 
of 
taste 
which 
takes 
suffering 
casually 
and 
resists 
everything 
sad 
and 
profound. 
There 
are 
“cheerful 
people” 
who 
employ 
cheerfulness 
because 
they 
are 
misunderstood 
on 
its 
account—they 
want 
to 
be 
misunderstood. 
There 
are 
“scientific 
men” 
who 
employ 
science 
because 
it 
creates 
a 
cheerful 
appearance, 
and 
because 
being 
scientific 
suggests 
that 
a 
human 
being 
is 
superficial—they 
want 
to 
seduce 
others 
to 
this 
false 
inference. 
There 
are 
free, 
insolent 
spirits 
who 
would 
like 
to 
conceal 
and 
deny 
that 
they 
are 
broken, 
proud, 
incurable 
hearts 
(the 
cynicism 
of 
Hamlet—the 
case 
of 
Galiani);28 
and 
occasionally 
even 
foolishness 
is 
the 
mask 
for 
an 
unblessed 
all-too-certain 
knowledge. 


From 
which 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
characteristic 
of 
more 
refined 
humanity 
to 
respect 
“the 
mask” 
and 
not 
to 
indulge 
in 
psychology 
and 
curiosity 
in 
the 
wrong 
place. 



271 


What 
separates 
two 
people 
most 
profoundly 
is 
a 
different 
sense 
and 
degree 
of 
cleanliness. 
What 
avails 
all 
decency 
and 
mutual 
usefulness 
and 
good 
will 
toward 
each 
other—in 
the 
end 
the 
fact 
remains: 
“They 
can’t 
stand 
each 
other’s 
smell!” 


The 
highest 
instinct 
of 
cleanliness 
places 
those 
possessed 
of 
it 
in 
the 
oddest 
and 
most 
dangerous 
lonesomeness, 
as 
saints: 
for 
precisely 
this 
is 
saintliness 
—the 
highest 
spiritualization 
of 
this 
instinct. 
Whether 
one 
is 
privy 
to 
someone’s 
indescribable 
abundance 
of 
pleasure 
in 
the 
bath, 
or 
whether 
one 
feels 
some 
ardor 
and 
thirst 
that 
constantly 
drives 
the 
soul 
out 
of 
the 
night 
into 
the 
morning 
and 
out 
of 
the 
dim 
and 
“dark 
moods” 
into 
what 
is 
bright, 
brilliant, 
profound, 
and 
refined—just 
as 
such 
a 
propensity 
distinguishes—it 
is 
a 
noble 
propensity—it 
also 
separates. 


The 
saint’s 
pity 
is 
pity 
with 
the 
dirt 
of 
what 
is 
human, 
all 
too 
human. 
And 
there 
are 
degrees 
and 
heights 
where 
he 
experiences 
even 
pity 
itself 
as 
a 
pollution, 
as 
dirty— 



272 


Signs 
of 
nobility: 
never 
thinking 
of 
degrading 
our 
duties 
into 
duties 
for 
everybody; 
not 
wanting 
to 
delegate, 
to 
share, 
one’s 
own 
responsibility; 
counting 
one’s 
privileges 
and 
their 
exercise 
among 
one’s 
duties. 



273 


A 
human 
being 
who 
strives 
for 
something 
great 
considers 
everyone 
he 
meets 
on 
his 
way 
either 
as 
a 
means 
or 
as 
a 
delay 
and 
obstacle—or 
as 
a 
temporary 
resting 
place. 
His 
characteristic 
high-grade 
graciousness 
toward 
his 
fellow 
men 
becomes 
possible 
only 
once 
he 
has 
attained 
his 
height 
and 
rules. 
Impatience 
and 
his 
consciousness 
that 
until 
then 
he 
is 
always 
condemned 
to 
comedy—for 
even 
war 
is 
a 
comedy 
and 
conceals, 
just 
as 
every 
means 
conceals 
the 
end—spoil 
all 
of 
his 
relations 
to 
others: 
this 
type 
of 
man 
knows 
solitude 
and 
what 
is 
most 
poisonous 
in 
it. 



274 


The 
problem 
of 
those 
who 
are 
waiting.—It 
requires 
strokes 
of 
luck 
and 
much 
that 
is 
incalculable 
if 
a 
higher 
man 
in 
whom 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
problem 
lies 
dormant 
is 
to 
get 
around 
to 
action 
in 
time—to 
“eruption,” 
one 
might 
say. 
In 
the 
average 
case 
it 
does 
not 
happen, 
and 
in 
nooks 
all 
over 
the 
earth 
sit 
men 
who 
are 
waiting, 
scarcely 
knowing 
in 
what 
way 
they 
are 
waiting, 
much 
less 
that 
they 
are 
waiting 
in 
vain. 
Occasionally 
the 
call 
that 
awakens—that 
accident 
which 
gives 
the 
“permission” 
to 
act—comes 
too 
late, 
when 
the 
best 
youth 
and 
strength 
for 
action 
has 
already 
been 
used 
up 
by 
sitting 
still; 
and 
many 
have 
found 
to 
their 
horror 
when 
they 
“leaped 
up” 
that 
their 
limbs 
had 
gone 
to 
sleep 
and 
their 
spirit 
had 
become 
too 
heavy. 
“It 
is 
too 
late,” 
they 
said 
to 
themselves, 
having 
lost 
their 
faith 
in 
themselves 
and 
henceforth 
forever 
useless. 


Could 
it 
be 
that 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
spirit 
“Raphael 
without 
hands,” 
taking 
this 
phrase 
in 
the 
widest 
sense, 
is 
perhaps 
not 
the 
exception 
but 
the 
rule?29 


Genius 
is 
perhaps 
not 
so 
rare 
after 
all—but 
the 
five 
hundred 
hands 
it 
requires 
to 
tyrannize 
the 
kairos, 
“the 
right 
time,” 
seizing 
chance 
by 
its 
forelock. 



275 


Anyone 
who 
does 
not 
want 
to 
see 
what 
is 
lofty 
in 
a 
man 
looks 
that 
much 
more 
keenly 
for 
what 
is 
low 
in 
him 
and 
mere 
foreground—and 
thus 
betrays 
himself. 



276 


In 
all 
kinds 
of 
injury 
and 
loss 
the 
lower 
and 
coarser 
soul 
is 
better 
off 
than 
the 
nobler 
one: 
the 
dangers 
for 
the 
latter 
must 
be 
greater; 
the 
probability 
that 
it 
will 
come 
to 
grief 
and 
perish 
is 
actually, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
its 
life, 
tremendous. 


In 
a 
lizard 
a 
lost 
finger 
is 
replaced 
again; 
not 
so 
in 
man.

—Bad 
enough! 
The 
same 
old 
story! 
When 
one 
has 
finished 
building 
ones’ 
house, 
one 
suddenly 
realizes 
that 
in 
the 
process 
one 
has 
learned 
something 
that 
one 
really 
needed 
to 
know 
in 
the 
worst 
way—before 
one 
began. 
The 
eternal 
distasteful 
“too 
late!” 


The 
melancholy 
of 
everything 
finished!30— 



278 


Wanderer, 
who 
are 
you? 
I 
see 
you 
walking 
on 
your 
way 
without 
scorn, 
without 
love, 
with 
unfathomable 
eyes; 
moist 
and 
sad 
like 
a 
sounding 
lead 
that 
has 
returned 
to 
the 
light, 
unsated, 
from 
every 
depth—what 
did 
it 
seek 
down 
there?—with 
a 
breast 
that 
does 
not 
sigh, 
with 
a 
lip 
that 
conceals 
its 
disgust, 
with 
a 
hand 
that 
now 
reaches 
only 
slowly: 
who 
are 
you? 
what 
have 
you 
done? 
Rest 
here: 
this 
spot 
is 
hospitable 
to 
all—recuperate! 
And 
whoever 
you 
may 
be: 
what 
do 
you 
like 
now? 
what 
do 
you 
need 
for 
recreation? 
Name 
it: 
whatever 
I 
have 
I 
offer 
to 
you! 


“Recreation? 
Recreation? 
You 
are 
inquisitive! 
What 
are 
you 
saying! 
But 
give 
me, 
please——” 


What? 
What? 
Say 
it! 


“Another 
mask! 
A 
second 
mask!”31— 



279 


Men 
of 
profound 
sadness 
betray 
themselves 
when 
they 
are 
happy: 
they 
have 
a 
way 
of 
embracing 
happiness 
as 
if 
they 
wanted 
to 
crush 
and 
suffocate 
it, 
from 
jealousy: 
alas, 
they 
know 
only 
too 
well 
that 
it 
will 
flee. 



280 


“Too 
bad! 
What? 
Isn’t 
he 
going—back?” 


Yes, 
but 
you 
understand 
him 
badly 
when 
you 
complain. 
He 
is 
going 
back 
like 
anybody 
who 
wants 
to 
attempt 
a 
big 
jump.— 



281 


—“Will 
people 
believe 
me? 
But 
I 
demand 
that 
they 
should 
believe 
me: 
I 
have 
always 
thought 
little 
and 
badly 
of 
myself, 
only 
on 
very 
rare 
occasions, 
only 
when 
I 
had 
to, 
always 
without 
any 
desire 
for 
‘this 
subject,’ 
more 
than 
ready 
to 
digress 
from 
‘myself; 
always 
without 
faith 
in 
the 
result, 
owing 
to 
an 
unconquerable 
mistrust 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
self-knowledge 
which 
went 
so 
far 
that 
even 
in 
the 
concept 
of 
‘immediate 
knowledge,’ 
which 
theoreticians 
permit 
themselves, 
I 
sensed 
a 
contradictio 
in 
adjecto: 
this 
whole 
fact 
is 
almost 
the 
most 
certain 
thing 
I 
do 
know 
about 
myself. 
There 
must 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
aversion 
in 
me 
to 
believing 
anything 
definite 
about 
myself. 


“Does 
this 
perhaps 
point 
to 
a 
riddle? 
Probably; 
but 
fortunately 
none 
for 
my 
own 
teeth. 


“Perhaps 
it 
betrays 
the 
species 
to 
which 
I 
belong? 


“But 
not 
to 
me—and 
of 
that 
I 
am 
glad.” 



282 


—“But 
whatever 
happened 
to 
you?” 


“I 
don’t 
know,” 
he 
said 
hesitantly; 
“perhaps 
the 
Harpies 
flew 
over 
my 
table.” 


Nowadays 
it 
happens 
occasionally 
that 
a 
mild, 
moderate, 
reticent 
person 
suddenly 
goes 
into 
a 
rage, 
smashes 
dishes, 
upends 
the 
table, 
screams, 
raves, 
insults 
everybody—and 
eventually 
walks 
off, 
ashamed, 
furious 
with 
himself 
—where? 
what 
for? 
To 
starve 
by 
himself? 
To 
suffocate 
on 
his 
recollection? 


If 
a 
person 
has 
the 
desires 
of 
a 
high 
and 
choosy 
soul 
and 
only 
rarely 
finds 
his 
table 
set 
and 
his 
food 
ready, 
his 
danger 
will 
be 
great 
at 
all 
times; 
but 
today 
it 
is 
extraordinary. 
Thrown 
into 
a 
noisy 
and 
plebeian 
age 
with 
which 
he 
does 
not 
care 
to 
eat 
out 
of 
the 
same 
dishes, 
he 
can 
easily 
perish 
of 
hunger 
and 
thirst 
or, 
if 
eventually 
he 
“falls 
to” 
after 
all—of 
sudden 
nausea. 


Probably 
all 
of 
us 
have 
sat 
at 
tables 
where 
we 
did 
not 
belong; 
and 
precisely 
the 
most 
spiritual 
among 
us, 
being 
hardest 
to 
nourish, 
know 
that 
dangerous 
dyspepsia 
which 
comes 
of 
a 
sudden 
insight 
and 
disappointment 
about 
our 
food 
and 
our 
neighbors 
at 
the 
table—the 
after-dinner 
nausea. 



283 


It 
involves 
subtle 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
noble 
self-control, 
assuming 
that 
one 
wants 
to 
praise 
at 
all, 
if 
one 
always 
praises 
only 
where 
one 
does 
not 
agree: 
for 
in 
the 
other 
case 
one 
would 
after 
all 
praise 
oneself, 
which 
offends 
good 
taste. 
Still 
this 
kind 
of 
self-control 
furnishes 
a 
neat 
occasion 
and 
provocation 
for 
constant 
misunderstandings. 
To 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
afford 
this 
real 
luxury 
of 
taste 
and 
morality, 
one 
must 
not 
live 
among 
dolts 
of 
the 
spirit 
but 
rather 
among 
people 
whose 
misunderstandings 
and 
blunders 
are 
still 
amusing 
owing 
to 
their 
subtlety—or 
one 
will 
have 
to 
pay 
dearly 
for 
it! 


“He 
praises 
me: 
hence 
he 
thinks 
I 
am 
right”—this 
asinine 
inference 
spoils 
half 
our 
life 
for 
us 
hermits, 
for 
it 
leads 
asses 
to 
seek 
our 
neighborhood 
and 
friendship. 



284 


To 
live 
with 
tremendous 
and 
proud 
composure; 
always 
beyond—. 
To 
have 
and 
not 
to 
have 
one’s 
affects, 
one’s 
pro 
and 
con, 
at 
will; 
to 
condescend 
to 
them, 
for 
a 
few 
hours; 
to 
seat 
oneself 
on 
them 
as 
on 
a 
horse, 
often 
as 
on 
an 
ass—for 
one 
must 
know 
how 
to 
make 
use 
of 
their 
stupidity 
as 
much 
as 
of 
their 
fire. 
To 
reserve 
one’s 
three 
hundred 
foregrounds; 
also 
the 
dark 
glasses; 
for 
there 
are 
cases 
when 
nobody 
may 
look 
into 
our 
eyes, 
still 
less 
into 
our 
“grounds.” 
And 
to 
choose 
for 
company 
that 
impish 
and 
cheerful 
vice, 
courtesy. 
And 
to 
remain 
master 
of 
one’s 
four 
virtues: 
of 
courage, 
insight, 
sympathy, 
and 
solitude.32 


For 
solitude 
is 
a 
virtue 
for 
us, 
as 
a 
sublime 
bent 
and 
urge 
for 
cleanliness 
which 
guesses 
how 
all 
contact 
between 
man 
and 
man—“in 
society”— 
involves 
inevitable 
uncleanliness. 
All 
community 
makes 
men—somehow, 
somewhere, 
sometime 
“common.” 



285 


The 
greatest 
events 
and 
thoughts—but 
the 
greatest 
thoughts 
are 
the 
greatest 
events—are 
comprehended 
last: 
the 
generations 
that 
are 
contemporaneous 
with 
them 
do 
not 
experience 
such 
events—they 
live 
right 
past 
them. 
What 
happens 
is 
a 
little 
like 
what 
happens 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
stars. 
The 
light 
of 
the 
remotest 
stars 
comes 
last 
to 
men; 
and 
until 
it 
has 
arrived 
man 
denies 
that 
there 
are—stars 
there. 
“How 
many 
centuries 
does 
a 
spirit 
require 
to 
be 
comprehended?”—that 
is 
a 
standard, 
too; 
with 
that, 
too, 
one 
creates 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
and 
etiquette 
that 
is 
still 
needed—for 
spirit 
and 
star.33 



286 


“Here 
the 
vision 
is 
free, 
the 
spirit 
exalted.”34 


But 
there 
is 
an 
opposite 
type 
of 
man 
that 
is 
also 
on 
a 
height 
and 
also 
has 
free 
vision—but 
looks 
down. 



287 


—What 
is 
noble? 
What 
does 
the 
word 
“noble” 
still 
mean 
to 
us 
today? 
What 
betrays, 
what 
allows 
one 
to 
recognize 
the 
noble 
human 
being, 
under 
this 
heavy, 
overcast 
sky 
of 
the 
beginning 
rule 
of 
the 
plebs 
that 
makes 
everything 
opaque 
and 
leaden? 


It 
is 
not 
actions 
that 
prove 
him—actions 
are 
always 
open 
to 
many 
interpretations, 
always 
unfathomable—nor 
is 
it 
“works.” 
Among 
artists 
and 
scholars 
today 
one 
finds 
enough 
of 
those 
who 
betray 
by 
their 
works 
how 
they 
are 
impelled 
by 
a 
profound 
desire 
for 
what 
is 
noble; 
but 
just 
this 
need 
for 
what 
is 
noble 
is 
fundamentally 
different 
from 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
noble 
soul 
itself 
and 
actually 
the 
eloquent 
and 
dangerous 
mark 
of 
its 
lack. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
works, 
it 
is 
the 
faith 
that 
is 
decisive 
here, 
that 
determines 
the 
order 
of 
rank— 
to 
take 
up 
again 
an 
ancient 
religious 
formula 
in 
a 
new 
and 
more 
profound 
sense: 
some 
fundamental 
certainty 
that 
a 
noble 
soul 
has 
about 
itself, 
something 
that 
cannot 
be 
sought, 
nor 
found, 
nor 
perhaps 
lost. 


35 


The 
noble 
soul 
has 
reverence 
for 
itself. 



288 


There 
are 
human 
beings 
who 
have 
spirit 
in 
an 
inevitable 
way; 
they 
may 
turn 
and 
twist 
as 
they 
please 
and 
hold 
their 
hands 
over 
their 
giveaway 
eyes 
(as 
if 
a 
hand 
did 
not 
give 
away 
secrets!)—in 
the 
end 
it 
always 
will 
out 
that 
they 
have 
something 
they 
conceal, 
namely 
spirit. 
One 
of 
the 
subtlest 
means 
for 
keeping 
up 
the 
deception 
at 
least 
as 
long 
as 
possible 
and 
of 
successfully 
appearing 
more 
stupid 
than 
one 
is—which 
in 
ordinary 
life 
is 
often 
as 
desirable 
as 
an 
umbrella—is 
called 
enthusiasm, 
if 
we 
include 
what 
belongs 
with 
it; 
for 
example, 
virtue. 
For 
as 
Galiani, 
who 
should 
know, 
says: 
vertu 
est 
enthousiasme. 



289 


In 
the 
writings36 
of 
a 
hermit 
one 
always 
also 
hears 
something 
of 
the 
echo 
of 
the 
desolate 
regions, 
something 
of 
the 
whispered 
tones 
and 
the 
furtive 
look 
of 
solitude; 
in 
his 
strongest 
words, 
even 
in 
his 
cry, 
there 
still 
vibrates 
a 
new 
and 
dangerous 
kind 
of 
silence—of 
burying 
something 
in 
silence. 
When 
a 
man 
has 
been 
sitting 
alone 
with 
his 
soul 
in 
confidential 
discord 
and 
discourse, 
year 
in 
and 
year 
out, 
day 
and 
night; 
when 
in 
his 
cave—it 
may 
be 
a 
labyrinth 
or 
a 
gold 
mine—he 
has 
become 
a 
cave 
bear 
or 
a 
treasure 
digger 
or 
a 
treasure 
guard 
and 
dragon; 
then 
even 
his 
concepts 
eventually 
acquire 
a 
peculiar 
twilight 
color, 
an 
odor 
just 
as 
much 
of 
depth 
as 
of 
must, 
something 
incommunicable 
and 
recalcitrant 
that 
blows 
at 
every 
passerby 
like 
a 
chill. 


The 
hermit 
does 
not 
believe 
that 
any 
philosopher—assuming 
that 
every 
philosopher 
was 
first 
of 
all 
a 
hermit—ever 
expressed 
his 
real 
and 
ultimate 
opinions 
in 
books: 
does 
one 
not 
write 
books 
precisely 
to 
conceal 
what 
one 
harbors?37 


Indeed, 
he 
will 
doubt 
whether 
a 
philosopher 
could 
possibly 
have 
“ultimate 
and 
real” 
opinions, 
whether 
behind 
every 
one 
of 
his 
caves 
there 
is 
not, 
must 
not 
be, 
another 
deeper 
cave—a 
more 
comprehensive, 
stranger, 
richer 
world 
beyond 
the 
surface, 
an 
abysmally 
deep 
ground 
behind 
every 
ground, 
under 
every 
attempt 
to 
furnish 
“grounds.”38 


Every 
philosophy 
is 
a 
foreground 
philosophy—that 
is 
a 
hermit’s 
judgment: 
“There 
is 
something 
arbitrary 
in 
his 
stopping 
here 
to 
look 
back 
and 
look 
around, 
in 
his 
not 
digging 
deeper 
here 
but 
laying 
his 
spade 
aside; 
there 
is 
also 
something 
suspicious 
about 
it.” 
Every 
philosophy 
also 
conceals 
a 
philosophy; 
every 
opinion 
is 
also 
a 
hideout, 
every 
word 
also 
a 
mask. 



290 


Every 
profound 
thinker 
is 
more 
afraid 
of 
being 
understood 
than 
of 
being 
misunderstood. 
The 
latter 
may 
hurt 
his 
vanity, 
but 
the 
former 
his 
heart, 
his 
sympathy, 
which 
always 
says: 
“Alas, 
why 
do 
you 
want 
to 
have 
as 
hard 
a 
time 
as 
I 
did?”

Man, 
a 
manifold, 
mendacious, 
artificial, 
and 
opaque 
animal, 
uncanny 
to 
the 
other 
animals 
less 
because 
of 
his 
strength 
than 
because 
of 
his 
cunning 
and 
shrewdness, 
has 
invented 
the 
good 
conscience 
to 
enjoy 
his 
soul 
for 
once 
as 
simple; 
and 
the 
whole 
of 
morality 
is 
a 
long 
undismayed 
forgery 
which 
alone 
makes 
it 
at 
all 
possible 
to 
enjoy 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
soul. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view 
much 
more 
may 
belong 
in 
the 
concept 
of 
“art” 
than 
is 
generally 
believed. 



292 


A 
philosopher—is 
a 
human 
being 
who 
constantly 
experiences, 
sees, 
hears, 
suspects, 
hopes, 
and 
dreams 
extraordinary 
things; 
who 
is 
struck 
by 
his 
own 
thoughts 
as 
from 
outside, 
as 
from 
above 
and 
below, 
as 
by 
his 
type 
of 
experiences 
and 
lightning 
bolts; 
who 
is 
perhaps 
himself 
a 
storm 
pregnant 
with 
new 
lightnings; 
a 
fatal 
human 
being 
around 
whom 
there 
are 
constant 
rumblings 
and 
growlings, 
crevices, 
and 
uncanny 
doings. 
A 
philosopher— 
alas, 
a 
being 
that 
often 
runs 
away 
from 
itself, 
often 
is 
afraid 
of 
itself—but 
too 
inquisitive 
not 
to 
“come 
to” 
again—always 
back 
to 
himself. 



293 


A 
man 
who 
says, 
“I 
like 
this, 
I 
take 
this 
for 
my 
own 
and 
want 
to 
protect 
it 
and 
defend 
it 
against 
anybody”; 
a 
man 
who 
is 
able 
to 
manage 
something, 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
resolution, 
to 
remain 
faithful 
to 
a 
thought, 
to 
hold 
a 
woman, 
to 
punish 
and 
prostrate 
one 
who 
presumed 
too 
much; 
a 
man 
who 
has 
his 
wrath 
and 
his 
sword 
and 
to 
whom 
the 
weak, 
the 
suffering, 
the 
hard 
pressed, 
and 
the 
animals, 
too, 
like 
to 
come39 
and 
belong 
by 
nature, 
in 
short 
a 
man 
who 
is 
by 
nature 
a 
master—when 
such 
a 
man 
has 
pity, 
well, 
this 
pity 
has 
value. 
But 
what 
good 
is 
the 
pity 
of 
those 
who 
suffer. 
Or 
those 
who, 
worse, 
preach 
pity. 


Almost 
everywhere 
in 
Europe 
today 
we 
find 
a 
pathological 
sensitivity 
and 
receptivity 
to 
pain; 
also 
a 
repulsive 
incontinence 
in 
lamentation, 
an 
increase 
in 
tenderness 
that 
would 
use 
religion 
and 
philosophical 
bric-a-brac 
to 
deck 
itself 
out 
as 
something 
higher—there 
is 
a 
veritable 
cult 
of 
suffering. 
The 
unmanliness 
of 
what 
is 
baptized 
as 
“pity” 
in 
the 
circles 
of 
such 
enthusiasts 
is, 
I 
should 
think, 
what 
always 
meets 
the 
eye 
first. 


This 
newest 
kind 
of 
bad 
taste 
should 
be 
exorcized 
vigorously 
and 
thoroughly; 
and 
I 
finally 
wish 
that 
one 
might 
place 
around 
one’s 
heart 
and 
neck 
the 
good 
amulet 
“gai 
saber”—“gay 
science,” 
to 
make 
it 
plain 
to 
the 
plain.40

The 
Olympian 
vice.— 
In 
despite 
of 
that 
philosopher 
who, 
being 
a 
real 
Englishman, 
tried 
to 
bring 
laughter 
into 
ill 
repute 
among 
all 
thinking 
men 
—“laughing 
is 
a 
bad 
infirmity 
of 
human 
nature, 
which 
every 
thinking 
mind 
will 
strive 
to 
overcome” 
(Hobbes)41 


I 
should 
actually 
risk 
an 
order 
of 
rank 
among 
philosophers 
depending 
on 
the 
rank 
of 
their 
laughter—all 
the 
way 
up 
to 
those 
capable 
of 
golden 
laughter. 
And 
supposing 
that 
gods, 
too, 
philosophize, 
which 
has 
been 
suggested 
to 
me 
by 
many 
an 
inference—I 
should 
not 
doubt 
that 
they 
also 
know 
how 
to 
laugh 
the 
while 
in 
a 
superhuman 
and 
new 
way—and 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
all 
serious 
things. 
Gods 
enjoy 
mockery: 
it 
seems 
they 
cannot 
suppress 
laughter 
even 
during 
holy 
rites.

The 
genius 
of 
the 
heart, 
as 
that 
great 
concealed 
one 
possesses 
it, 
the 
tempter 
god42 
and 
born 
pied 
piper 
of 
consciences 
whose 
voice 
knows 
how 
to 
descend 
into 
the 
netherworld 
of 
every 
soul; 
who 
does 
not 
say 
a 
word 
or 
cast 
a 
glance 
in 
which 
there 
is 
no 
consideration 
and 
ulterior 
enticement; 
whose 
mastery 
includes 
the 
knowledge 
of 
how 
to 
seem—not 
what 
he 
is 
but 
what 
is 
to 
those 
who 
follow 
him 
one 
more 
constraint 
to 
press 
ever 
closer 
to 
him 
in 
order 
to 
follow 
him 
ever 
more 
inwardly 
and 
thoroughly—the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
who 
silences 
all 
that 
is 
loud 
and 
self-satisfied, 
teaching 
it 
to 
listen; 
who 
smooths 
rough 
souls 
and 
lets 
them 
taste 
a 
new 
desire—to 
lie 
still 
as 
a 
mirror, 
that 
the 
deep 
sky 
may 
mirror 
itself 
in 
them—the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
who 
teaches 
the 
doltish 
and 
rash 
hand 
to 
hesitate 
and 
reach 
out 
more 
delicately; 
who 
guesses 
the 
concealed 
and 
forgotten 
treasure, 
the 
drop 
of 
graciousness 
and 
sweet 
spirituality 
under 
dim 
and 
thick 
ice, 
and 
is 
a 
divining 
rod 
for 
every 
grain 
of 
gold 
that 
has 
long 
lain 
buried 
in 
the 
dungeon 
of 
much 
mud 
and 
sand; 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
from 
whose 
touch 
everyone 
walks 
away 
richer, 
not 
having 
received 
grace 
and 
surprised, 
not 
as 
blessed 
and 
oppressed 
by 
alien 
goods, 
but 
richer 
in 
himself, 
newer 
to 
himself 
than 
before, 
broken 
open, 
blown 
at 
and 
sounded 
out 
by 
a 
thawing 
wind, 
perhaps 
more 
unsure, 
tenderer, 
more 
fragile, 
more 
broken, 
but 
full 
of 
hopes 
that 
as 
yet 
have 
no 
name, 
full 
of 
new 
will 
and 
currents, 
full 
of 
new 
dissatisfaction 
and 
undertows——but 
what 
am 
I 
doing, 
my 
friends?43 


Of 
whom 
am 
I 
speaking 
to 
you? 
Have 
I 
forgotten 
myself 
so 
far 
that 
I 
have 
not 
even 
told 
you 
his 
name? 
Unless 
you 
have 
guessed 
by 
yourselves 
who 
this 
questionable 
spirit 
and 
god 
is 
who 
wants 
to 
be 
praised 
in 
such 
fashion. 
For 
just 
as 
happens 
to 
everyone 
who 
from 
childhood 
has 
always 
been 
on 
his 
way 
and 
in 
foreign 
parts, 
many 
strange 
and 
not 
undangerous 
spirits 
have 
crossed 
my 
path, 
too, 
but 
above 
all 
he 
of 
whom 
I 
was 
speaking 
just 
now, 
and 
he 
again 
and 
again—namely, 
no 
less 
a 
one 
than 
the 
god 
Dionysus, 
that 
great 
ambiguous 
one 
and 
tempter 
god 
to 
whom 
I 
once 
offered, 
as 
you 
know, 
in 
all 
secrecy 
and 
reverence, 
my 
first-born—as 
the 
last, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
who 
offered 
him 
a 
sacrifice: 
for 
I 
have 
found 
no 
one 
who 
understood 
what 
I 
was 
doing 



then.44 


Meanwhile 
I 
have 
learned 
much, 
all 
too 
much, 
more 
about 
the 
philosophy 
of 
this 
god, 
and, 
as 
I 
said, 
from 
mouth 
to 
mouth—I, 
the 
last 
disciple 
and 
initiate 
of 
the 
god 
Dionysus—and 
I 
suppose 
I 
might 
begin 
at 
long 
last 
to 
offer 
you, 
my 
friends, 
a 
few 
tastes 
of 
this 
philosophy, 
insofar 
as 
this 
is 
permitted 
to 
me? 
In 
an 
undertone, 
as 
is 
fair, 
for 
it 
concerns 
much 
that 
is 
secret, 
new, 
strange, 
odd, 
uncanny. 


Even 
that 
Dionysus 
is 
a 
philosopher, 
and 
that 
gods, 
too, 
thus 
do 
philosophy, 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
a 
novelty 
that 
is 
far 
from 
innocuous 
and 
might 
arouse 
suspicion 
precisely 
among 
philosophers. 
Among 
you, 
my 
friends, 
it 
will 
not 
seem 
so 
offensive, 
unless 
it 
comes 
too 
late 
and 
not 
at 
the 
right 
moment; 
for 
today, 
as 
I 
have 
been 
told, 
you 
no 
longer 
like 
to 
believe 
in 
God 
and 
gods. 
Perhaps 
I 
shall 
also 
have 
to 
carry 
frankness 
further 
in 
my 
tale 
than 
will 
always 
be 
pleasing 
to 
the 
strict 
habits 
of 
your 
ears? 
Certainly 
the 
god 
in 
question 
went 
further, 
very 
much 
further, 
in 
dialogues 
of 
this 
sort 
and 
was 
always 
many 
steps 
ahead 
of 
me. 


Indeed, 
if 
it 
were 
permitted 
to 
follow 
human 
custom 
in 
according 
to 
him 
many 
solemn 
pomp-and-virtue 
names, 
I 
should 
have 
to 
give 
abundant 
praise 
to 
his 
explorer 
and 
discoverer 
courage, 
his 
daring 
honesty, 
truthfulness, 
and 
love 
of 
wisdom. 
But 
such 
a 
god 
has 
no 
use 
whatever 
for 
all 
such 
venerable 
junk 
and 
pomp. 
“Keep 
that,” 
he 
would 
say, 
“for 
yourself 
and 
your 
likes 
and 
whoever 
else 
has 
need 
of 
it! 
I—have 
no 
reason 
for 
covering 
my 
nakedness.” 


One 
guesses: 
this 
type 
of 
deity 
and 
philosopher 
is 
perhaps 
lacking 
in 
shame? 


Thus 
he 
once 
said: 
“Under 
certain 
circumstances 
I 
love 
what 
is 
human”— 
and 
with 
this 
he 
alluded 
to 
Ariadne 
who 
was 
present45 


—“man 
is 
to 
my 
mind 
an 
agreeable, 
courageous, 
inventive 
animal 
that 
has 
no 
equal 
on 
earth; 
it 
finds 
its 
way 
in 
any 
labyrinth. 
I 
am 
well 
disposed 
towards 
him: 
I 
often 
reflect 
how 
I 
might 
yet 
advance 
him 
and 
make 
him 
stronger, 
more 
evil, 
and 
more 
profound 
than 
he 
is.” 


“Stronger, 
more 
evil, 
and 
more 
profound?” 
I 
asked 
startled. 
“Yes,” 
he 
said 
once 
more; 
“stronger, 
more 
evil, 
and 
more 
profound; 
also 
more 
beautiful”— 
and 
at 
that 
the 
tempter 
god 
smiled 
with 
his 
halcyon 
smile 
as 
though 
he 
had 
just 
paid 
an 
enchanting 
compliment. 
Here 
we 
also 
see: 
what 
this 
divinity 
lacks 
is 
not 
only 
a 
sense 
of 
shame—and 
there 
are 
also 
other 
good 
reasons 
for 
conjecturing 
that 
in 
several 
respects 
all 
of 
the 
gods 
could 
learn 
from 
us 
humans. 
We 
humans 
are—more 
humane.46— 



296 


Alas, 
what 
are 
you 
after 
all, 
my 
written 
and 
painted 
thoughts! 
It 
was 
not 
long 
ago 
that 
you 
were 
still 
so 
colorful, 
young, 
and 
malicious, 
full 
of 
thorns 
and 
secret 
spices—you 
made 
me 
sneeze 
and 
laugh—and 
now? 
You 
have 
already 
taken 
off 
your 
novelty, 
and 
some 
of 
you 
are 
ready, 
I 
fear, 
to 
become 
truths: 
they 
already 
look 
so 
immortal, 
so 
pathetically 
decent, 
so 
dull! 
And 
has 
it 
ever 
been 
different? 
What 
things 
do 
we 
copy, 
writing 
and 
painting, 
we 
mandarins 
with 
Chinese 
brushes, 
we 
immortalizers 
of 
things 
that 
can 
be 
written—what 
are 
the 
only 
things 
we 
are 
able 
to 
paint? 
Alas, 
always 
only 
what 
is 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
withering 
and 
losing 
its 
fragrance! 
Alas; 
always 
only 
storms 
that 
are 
passing, 
exhausted, 
and 
feelings 
that 
are 
autumnal 
and 
yellow! 
Alas, 
always 
only 
birds 
that 
grew 
weary 
of 
flying 
and 
flew 
astray 
and 
now 
can 
be 
caught 
by 
hand—by 
our 
hand! 
We 
immortalize 
what 
cannot 
live 
and 
fly 
much 
longer—only 
weary 
and 
mellow 
things! 
And 
it 
is 
only 
your 
afternoon, 
you, 
my 
written 
and 
painted 
thoughts, 
for 
which 
alone 
I 
have 
colors, 
many 
colors 
perhaps, 
many 
motley 
caresses 
and 
fifty 
yellows 
and 
browns 
and 
greens 
and 
reds: 
but 
nobody 
will 
guess 
from 
that 
how 
you 
looked 
in 
your 
morning, 
you 
sudden 
sparks 
and 
wonders 
of 
my 
solitude, 
you 
my 
old 
beloved—wicked 
thoughts!

These 
crucial 
qualifications, 
though 
added 
immediately, 
have 
often 
been 
overlooked. 
“Modern” 
moralities 
are 
clearly 
mixtures; 
hence 
their 
manifold 
tensions, 
hypocrisies, 
and 
contradictions. 


6 
The 
final 
clause 
that 
follows 
the 
dash, 
omitted 
in 
the 
Cowan 
translation, 
is 
crucial 
and 
qualifies 
the 
first 
part 
of 
the 
sentence: 
a 
noble 
person 
has 
no 
duties 
to 
animals 
but 
treats 
them 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
feelings, 
which 
means, 
if 
he 
is 
noble, 
with 
pity. 


The 
ruling 
masters, 
of 
course, 
are 
not 
always 
noble 
in 
this 
sense, 
and 
this 
is 
recognized 
by 
Nietzsche 
in 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols, 
in 
the 
chapter 
“The 
‘Improvers’ 
of 
Mankind,” 
in 
which 
he 
gives 
strong 
expression 
to 
his 
distaste 
for 
Manu’s 
laws 
concerning 
outcastes 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
503-05); 
also 
in 
The 
Will 
to 
Power 
(ed. 
W. 
Kaufmann, 
New 
York, 
Random 
House, 
1967), 
section 
142. 
Indeed, 
in 
The 
Antichrist, 
section 
57, 
Nietzsche 
contradicts 
outright 
his 
formulation 
above: 
“When 
the 
exceptional 
human 
being 
treats 
the 
mediocre 
more 
tenderly 
than 
himself 
and 
his 
peers, 
this 
is 
not 
mere 
courtesy 
of 
the 
heart—it 
is 
simply 
his 
duty.” 


More 
important: 
Nietzsche’s 
obvious 
distaste 
for 
slave 
morality 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
makes 
a 
point 
of 
liking 
master 
morality 
better 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
he 
endorses 
master 
morality. 
Cf. 
the 
text 
for 
note 
5 
above. 


7 
Clearly, 
master 
morality 
cannot 
be 
discovered 
by 
introspection 
nor 
by 
the 
observation 
of 
individuals 
who 
are 
“masters” 
rather 
than 
“slaves.” 
Both 
of 
these 
misunderstandings 
are 
widespread. 
What 
is 
called 
for 
is 
rather 
a 
rereading 
of, 
say, 
the 
Iliad 
and, 
to 
illustrate 
“slave 
morality,” 
the 
New 
Testament.

Literally 
“a 
good 
human 
being,” 
the 
term 
is 
used 
for 
precisely 
the 
type 
described 
here. 


9 
“Gay 
science”: 
in 
the 
early 
fourteenth 
century 
the 
term 
was 
used 
to 
designate 
the 
art 
of 
the 
troubadours, 
codified 
in 
Leys 
d’amors. 
Nietzsche 
subtitled 
his 
own 
Fröhliche 
Wissenschaft 
(1882), 
“la 
gaya 
scienza,” 
placed 
a 
quatrain 
on 
the 
title 
page, 
began 
the 
book 
with 
a 
fifteen-page 
“Prelude 
in 
German 
Rhymes,” 
and 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
(1887) 
added, 
besides 
a 
Preface 
and 
Book 
V, 
an 
“Appendix” 
of 
further 
verses.

Here, 
as 
elsewhere, 
Nietzsche 
gives 
expression 
to 
his 
Lamarckian 
belief 
in 
the 
heredity 
of 
acquired 
characteristics, 
shared 
by 
Samuel 
Butler 
and 
Bernard 
Shaw 
but 
anathema 
to 
Nazi 
racists 
and 
almost 
universally 
rejected 
by 
geneticists. 
His 
Lamarckism 
is 
not 
just 
an 
odd 
fact 
about 
Nietzsche 
but 
symptomatic 
of 
his 
conception 
of 
body 
and 
spirit: 
he 
ridiculed 
belief 
in 
“pure” 
spirit 
but 
believed 
just 
as 
little 
in 
any 
“pure” 
body; 
he 
claimed 
that 
neither 
could 
be 
understood 
without 
the 
other.

An 
allusion 
to 
an 
oft-quoted 
sentence 
from 
Lessing’s 
Emilia 
Galotti, 
Act 
I, 
Scene 
4: 
“Or 
do 
you 
think, 
my 
Prince, 
that 
Raphael 
would 
not 
have 
been 
the 
greatest 
artistic 
[literally: 
painterly] 
genius 
if 
he 
had 
been 
born 
by 
some 
misfortune 
without 
hands?” 


This 
section 
reminds 
us 
forcefully 
that 
Nietzsche 
is 
not 
proposing 
any 
easy 
bifurcation 
of 
mankind: 
not 
only 
are 
appearances 
misleading, 
as 
he 
points 
out 
again 
and 
again, 
but 
he 
considers 
the 
belief 
in 
opposite 
values 
an 
inveterate 
prejudice 
(see, 
e.g., 
section 
2) 
and 
insists 
on 
a 
scale 
of 
subtle 
shades, 
degrees, 
and 
nuances. 


30 
This 
section 
may 
signal 
the 
approaching 
end 
of 
the 
book. 
And 
the 
immediately 
following 
sections, 
being 
less 
continuous 
than 
the 
preceding, 
may 
also 
have 
been 
placed 
here 
from 
a 
sense 
of 
“where 
else?”—the 
end 
being 
at 
hand. 
In 
a 
sense, 
to 
be 
sure, 
they 
belong 
in 
Part 
IX, 
“What 
Is 
Noble,” 
for 
they 
deal 
with 
the 
feelings 
of 
the 
uncommon 
man 
who 
lives 
apart; 
but 
they 
seem 
more 
personal. 


31 
See 
sections 
30, 
40, 
289, 
and 
290. 


32 
But 
see 
section 
227: 
“Honesty, 
supposing 
that 
this 
is 
our 
virtue 
…” 
And 
Dawn, 
section 
556 
(quoted 
in 
full): 
“The 
good 
four.— 
Honest 
with 
ourselves 
and 
whoever 
else 
is 
our 
friend; 
courageous 
with 
the 
enemy; 
magnanimous 
with 
the 
vanquished; 
courteous—always: 
thus 
the 
four 
cardinal 
virtues 
want 
us.” 
Plato’s 
four 
cardinal 
virtues 
had 
been 
wisdom, 
courage, 
temperance, 
and 
justice 
(Republic 
427ff.). 
In 
German, 
the 
four 
terms 
in 
the 
Dawn 
are: 
redlich, 
tapfer, 
grossmütig, 
höflich; 
the 
four 
above: 
Mut, 
Einsicht, 
Mitgefühl, 
Einsamkeit. 
Mut 
and 
Tapferkeit 
are 
synonyms 
and 
mean 
courage. 
Honesty 
and 
insight 
are 
clearly 
related 
but 
not 
synonymous, 
and 
this 
is 
also 
true 
of 
magnanimity 
and 
sympathy. 
(The 
literal 
meaning 
of 
sympathy 
and 
Mitgefühl 
is 
the 
same 
and 
neither 
is 
restricted 
to 
suffering; 
both 
mean 
feeling 
with 
others 
what 
they 
feel.) 
The 
inclusion 
of 
sympathy 
among 
the 
four 
virtues 
is 
noteworthy, 
particularly 
as 
it 
occurs 
in 
“What 
Is 
Noble” 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil. 


33 
Cf. 
Zarathustra, 
Part 
II: 
“the 
greatest 
events—they 
are 
not 
our 
loudest 
but 
our 
stillest 
hours. 
Not 
around 
the 
inventors 
of 
new 
noise, 
but 



around 
the 
inventors 
of 
new 
values 
does 
the 
world 
revolve; 
it 
revolves 
inaudibly” 
(“On 
Great 
Events,” 
p. 
243); 
and 
“Thoughts 
that 
come 
on 
doves’ 
feet 
guide 
the 
world” 
(“The 
Stillest 
Hour,” 
p. 
258). 
The 
implications 
for 
Nietzsche’s 
alleged 
bifurcation 
of 
humanity 
should 
not 
be 
overlooked: 
We 
are 
in 
no 
position 
to 
tell 
who 
among 
our 
contemporaries 
is 
great. 


34 
Goethe’s 
Faust, 
lines 
11989f. 
This 
aphorism 
makes 
little 
sense 
unless 
one 
recognizes 
the 
quotation 
and 
knows 
that 
Doctor 
Marianus 
thus 
leads 
up 
to 
his 
apostrophe 
to 
the 
queen 
of 
heaven.— 
One 
may 
wonder 
whether 
it 
could 
possibly 
be 
noble 
to 
insist 
so 
often 
that 
one 
is 
looking 
down; 
but 
at 
least 
Nietzsche 
does 
not 
purport 
to 
speak 
of 
himself. 


35 
Cf. 
Aristotle’s 
Nicomachean 
Ethics 
(1169a): 
“The 
good 
man 
ought 
to 
be 
a 
lover 
of 
self, 
since 
he 
will 
then 
act 
nobly, 
and 
so 
both 
benefit 
himself 
and 
his 
fellows; 
but 
the 
bad 
man 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
a 
lover 
of 
self, 
since 
he 
will 
follow 
his 
base 
passions, 
and 
so 
injure 
both 
himself 
and 
his 
neighbours” 
(Rackham 
translation).

Translated 
into 
English 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
German. 
Though 
the 
words 
appear 
in 
quotation 
marks, 
there 
seem 
to 
be 
only 
five 
passages 
in 
which 
Hobbes 
discusses 
laughter—never 
in 
quite 
these 
words. 
(Two 
of 
these 
are 
found 
in 
the 
Latin 
works 
and 
add 
nothing 
to 
the 
quotations 
that 
follow.) 
Hobbes 
explained 
laughter 
by 
invoking 
the 
will 
to 
power, 
albeit 
without 
using 
that 
term. 


The 
first 
and 
longest 
discussion 
is 
found 
in 
Human 
Nature 
(1640), 
Chapter 
IX.13: 
“There 
is 
a 
passion 
that 
hath 
no 
name; 
but 
the 
sign 
of 
it 
is 
that 
distortion 
of 
the 
countenance 
which 
we 
call 
laughter, 
which 
is 
always 
joy.… 
Whatsoever 
it 
be 
that 
moveth 
to 
laughter, 
it 
must 
be 
new 
and 
unexpected. 
Men 
laugh 
often, 
especially 
such 
as 
are 
greedy 
of 
applause 
from 
every 
thing 
they 
do 
well, 
at 
their 
own 
actions 
performed 



never 
so 
little 
beyond 
their 
own 
expectations; 
as 
also 
at 
their 
own 
jests: 
and 
in 
this 
case 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
the 
passion 
of 
laughter 
proceedeth 
from 
a 
sudden 
conception 
of 
some 
ability 
in 
himself 
that 
laugheth. 
Also 
men 
laugh 
at 
the 
infirmities 
of 
others, 
by 
comparison 
wherewith 
their 
own 
abilities 
are 
set 
off 
and 
illustrated. 
Also 
men 
laugh 
at 
jests, 
the 
wit 
whereof 
always 
consisteth 
in 
the 
elegant 
discovering 
and 
conveying 
to 
our 
minds 
some 
absurdity 
of 
another: 
and 
in 
this 
case 
also 
the 
passion 
of 
laughter 
proceedeth 
from 
the 
sudden 
imagination 
of 
our 
own 
odds 
and 
eminency.… 
For 
when 
a 
jest 
is 
broken 
upon 
ourselves, 
or 
friends 
of 
whose 
dishonour 
we 
participate, 
we 
never 
laugh 
thereat. 
I 
may 
therefore 
conclude, 
that 
the 
passion 
of 
laughter 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
sudden 
glory 
arising 
from 
some 
sudden 
conception 
of 
some 
eminency 
in 
ourselves, 
by 
comparison 
with 
the 
infirmity 
of 
others, 
or 
with 
our 
own 
formerly: 
for 
men 
laugh 
at 
the 
follies 
of 
themselves 
past 
… 
Besides, 
it 
is 
vain 
glory, 
and 
an 
argument 
of 
little 
worth, 
to 
think 
the 
infirmity 
of 
another, 
sufficient 
matter 
for 
his 
triumph.” 


The 
parallel 
passage 
in 
the 
Leviathan 
(1651), 
Part 
I, 
Chapter 
6, 
p. 
27, 
which 
is 
much 
shorter, 
ends: 
“And 
it 
is 
incident 
most 
to 
them, 
that 
are 
conscious 
of 
the 
fewest 
abilities 
in 
themselves; 
who 
are 
forced 
to 
keep 
themselves 
in 
their 
own 
favour, 
by 
observing 
the 
imperfections 
of 
other 
men. 
And 
therefore 
much 
Laughter 
at 
the 
defects 
of 
others 
is 
a 
signe 
of 
Pusillanimity. 
For 
of 
great 
minds, 
one 
of 
the 
proper 
workes 
is, 
to 
help 
and 
free 
others 
from 
scorn; 
and 
compare 
themselves 
onely 
with 
the 
most 
able.” 


Finally, 
in 
“The 
Answer 
of 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
to 
Sir 
William 
Davenant’s 
Preface 
before 
Gondibert” 
(Paris, 
Jan. 
10, 
1650; 
reprinted 
in 
The 
English 
Works 
of 
Thomas 
Hobbes, 
vol. 
IV, 
1840) 
Hobbes 
says 
(pp. 
454f.): 
“Great 
persons, 
that 
have 
their 
minds 
employed 
on 
great 
designs, 
have 
not 
leisure 
enough 
to 
laugh, 
and 
are 
pleased 
with 
the 
contemplation 
of 
their 
own 
power 
and 
virtues, 
so 
as 
they 
need 
not 
the 
infirmities 
and 
vices 
of 
other 
men 
to 
recommend 
themselves 
to 
their 
own 
favour 
by 
comparison, 
as 
all 
men 
do 
when 
they 
laugh.” 


Hobbes 
is 
evidently 
thinking 
quite 
literally 
of 
laughter 
while 
for 
Nietzsche 
laughter 
represents 
an 
attitude 
toward 
the 
world, 
toward 
life, 
and 
toward 
oneself. 
In 
The 
Gay 
Science 
(1882) 
he 
had 
written: 
“Laughter 
means: 
to 
rejoice 
at 
another’s 
expense 
[schadenfroh 
sein], 
but 
with 
a 
good 
conscience” 
(section 
200). 
And 
still 
earlier, 
in 
Human, 
All



Too-Human 
(1878): 
“Descending 
below 
the 
animals.— 
When 
man 
neighs 
with 
laughter, 
he 
surpasses 
all 
animals 
by 
his 
vulgarity” 
(section 
553). 
But 
in 
the 
second 
volume 
of 
the 
same 
work 
(1879) 
we 
find 
an 
aphorism 
(section 
173): 
“Laughing 
and 
smiling.— 
The 
more 
joyous 
and 
certain 
his 
spirit 
becomes, 
the 
more 
man 
unlearns 
loud 
laughter; 
instead 
a 
more 
spiritual 
smile 
constantly 
wells 
up 
in 
him.…” 
And 
in 
a 
note 
of 
that 
period 
(Musarion 
edition, 
IX, 
413): 
“Everything 
sudden 
pleases 
if 
it 
does 
no 
harm; 
hence 
wit.… 
For 
a 
tension 
is 
thus 
released.…” 
And 
another 
note 
(same 
page): 
“Caricature 
is 
the 
beginning 
of 
art. 
That 
something 
signifies, 
delights. 
That 
whatever 
signifies, 
should 
mock 
and 
be 
laughed 
at, 
delights 
still 
more. 
Laughing 
at 
something 
is 
the 
first 
sign 
of 
a 
higher 
psychic 
life 
(as 
in 
the 
fine 
arts).” 


In 
spite 
of 
the 
title 
The 
Gay 
Science, 
Nietzsche’s 
celebration 
of 
laughter 
is 
encountered 
first 
and 
foremost 
in 
Zarathustra. 
To 
cite 
all 
the 
relevant 
passages 
(Portable 
Nietzsche 
pp. 
248, 
272, 
294, 
310, 
341, 
342, 


427) 
would 
be 
pointless, 
but 
the 
three 
most 
significant 
should 
be 
mentioned. 
“Not 
by 
wrath 
does 
one 
kill 
but 
by 
laughter. 
Come, 
let 
us 
kill 
the 
spirit 
of 
gravity!” 
(“On 
Reading 
and 
Writing,” 
p. 
153). 
“As 
yet 
he 
has 
not 
learned 
laughter 
or 
beauty. 
Gloomy 
this 
hunter 
returned 
from 
the 
woods 
of 
knowledge.… 
But 
I 
do 
not 
like 
these 
tense 
souls.… 
As 
yet 
his 
knowledge 
has 
not 
learned 
to 
smile.… 
Gracefulness 
is 
part 
of 
the 
graciousness 
of 
the 
great-souled.… 
Verily, 
I 
have 
often 
laughed 
at 
the 
weaklings 
who 
thought 
themselves 
good 
because 
they 
had 
no 
claws” 
(“On 
Those 
Who 
Are 
Sublime,” 
pp. 
228-31, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
chapters 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
writings). 


“What 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
greatest 
sin 
here 
on 
earth? 
Was 
it 
not 
the 
word 
of 
him 
who 
said, 
‘Woe 
unto 
those 
who 
laugh 
here’? 
… 
He 
did 
not 
love 
enough: 
else 
he 
would 
also 
have 
loved 
us 
who 
laugh. 
But 
he 
hated 
and 
mocked 
us: 
howling 
and 
gnashing 
of 
teeth 
he 
promised 
us.… 
Laughter 
1 
have 
pronounced 
holy; 
you 
higher 
men, 
learn 
to 
laugh!” 
(“On 
the 
Higher 
Man,” 
sections 
16 
and 
20, 
pp. 
405-408). 


For 
Nietzsche 
laughter 
becomes 
less 
a 
physical 
phenomenon 
than 
a 
symbol 
of 
joyous 
affirmation 
of 
life 
and 
of 
the 
refusal 
to 
bow 
before 
the 
spirit 
of 
gravity. 


42 
Cf. 
section 
42, 
note: 
Versucher-Gott 
could 
also 
mean 
“god 
of 
experimenters.” 



43 
Some 
of 
the 
features 
of 
this 
portrait 
bring 
to 
mind 
Socrates. 
In 
this 
connection 
section 
212 
might 
be 
reread; 
also 
the 
beginning 
of 
section 
340 
of 
The 
Gay 
Science: 
“The 
dying 
Socrates.— 
I 
admire 
the 
courage 
and 
wisdom 
of 
Socrates 
in 
everything 
he 
did, 
said—and 
did 
not 
say. 
This 
mocking 
and 
enamored 
monster 
and 
pied 
piper 
of 
Athens, 
who 
made 
the 
most 
arrogant 
youths 
tremble 
and 
sob, 
was 
not 
only 
the 
wisest 
talker 
who 
ever 
lived: 
he 
was 
just 
as 
great 
in 
his 
silence.…” 


The 
image 
of 
the 
pied 
piper 
recurs 
in 
the 
first 
sentence 
of 
the 
present 
section—and 
the 
Preface 
to 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols 
where 
Nietzsche 
calls 
himself 
“an 
old 
psychologist 
and 
pied 
piper” 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
p. 
466). 
With 
the 
praise 
of 
Socrates’ 
greatness 
“in 
his 
silence” 
compare 
Nietzsche’s 
comment 
on 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
in 
Ecce 
Homo, 
where 
he 
praises 
the 
book 
for 
“the 
subtlety 
of 
its 
form, 
of 
its 
intent, 
of 
its 
art 
of 
silence,” 
all 
of 
which 
he 
contrasts 
with 
Zarathustra. 


Finally, 
the 
section 
on 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
should 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Platonic 
Socrates, 
on 
the 
last 
page 
of 
the 
Theaetetus: 
“Supposing 
you 
should 
ever 
henceforth 
try 
to 
conceive 
afresh, 
Theaetetus, 
if 
you 
succeed 
your 
embryo 
thoughts 
will 
be 
the 
better 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
today’s 
scrutiny; 
and 
if 
you 
remain 
barren, 
you 
will 
be 
gentler 
… 
having 
the 
good 
sense 
not 
to 
fancy 
you 
know 
what 
you 
do 
not 
know. 
For 
that, 
and 
no 
more, 
is 
all 
that 
my 
art 
can 
effect; 
nor 
have 
I 
any 
of 
that 
knowledge 
possessed 
by 
all 
the 
great 
and 
admirable 
men 
of 
our 
own 
day 
or 
of 
the 
past. 
But 
this 
midwife’s 
art 
is 
a 
gift 
from 
heaven; 
my 
mother 
had 
it 
for 
women, 
and 
I 
for 
young 
men 
of 
a 
generous 
spirit 
and 
for 
all 
in 
whom 
beauty 
dwells” 
(F. 
M. 
Cornford 
translation). 


44 
Although 
“first-born” 
is 
plural 
in 
the 
original 
(Erstlinge), 
the 
primary 
reference 
is 
certainly 
to 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy. 
From 
the 
Preface 
added 
to 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
1886 
(the 
same 
year 
that 
saw 
the 
publication 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil) 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
by 
now 
Nietzsche 
felt 
that 
he 
himself 
had 
not 
fully 
understood 
in 
1872 
what 
he 
was 
doing. 


More 
important: 
the 
Dionysus 
of 
his 
later 
works 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
Dionysus 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy. 
In 
the 
early 
work, 
Dionysus 
stands 
for 
uncontrolled, 
frenzied, 
intoxicated 
passion 
and 
is 
contrasted 
with 
Apollo; 
in 
the 
later 
works, 
Dionysus 
stands 
for 
controlled 
and 
creatively 
employed 
passion—the 
mature 
Goethe 
is 
now 
called 
Dionysian 
(Twilight, 
section 
49, 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
553f.)—and 
is 
contrasted 



with 
“the 
Crucified” 
(end 
of 
Ecce 
Homo) 
and 
the 
extirpation 
of 
the 
passions 
and 
the 
denial 
of 
this 
world. 


45 
There 
is 
a 
large 
literature, 
much 
of 
it 
inordinately 
pretentious 
and 
silly, 
about 
Nietzsche’s 
conception 
of 
Ariadne. 
For 
a 
very 
brief 
explanation, 
see 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
1, 
section 
II.

AFTERSONG 


TRANSLATOR’S 
NOTE 


“Aus 
hohen 
Bergen. 
Nachgesang.” 
In 
the 
original 
edition 
this 
title 
occupies 
a 
right-hand 
page 
by 
itself, 
facing 
section 
296, 
and 
the 
poem 
begins 
on 
the 
next 
right-hand 
page. 
The 
asterisks 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
end 
of 
the 
poem 
are 
found 
in 
the 
original 
edition. 


My 
translation, 
though 
relatively 
faithful, 
is 
not 
entirely 
literal; 
and 
this 
is 
one 
reason 
for 
furnishing 
the 
original 
text, 
too—in 
fairness 
to 
both 
author 
and 
reader. 
There 
is 
another 
reason: 
fairness 
to 
the 
translator; 
for 
the 
poem 
is 
not 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
best. 
(The 
five 
dots 
occurring 
four 
times 
in 
the 
German 
text 
do 
not 
mark 
an 
omission 
but 
are 
among 
Nietzsche’s 
characteristic 
punctuation 
devices: 
sometimes 
they 
are 
used 
to 
indicate 
that 
a 
thought 
breaks 
off 
or 
that 
something 
remains 
unsaid; 
here 
they 
plainly 
suggest 
a 
long 
pause.) 


More 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
verse, 
also 
with 
the 
original 
and 
translation 
on 
facing 
pages, 
is 
included 
in 
Twenty 
German 
Poets: 
A 
Bilingual 
Collection.1 


One 
of 
those 
poems, 
“To 
the 
Mistral: 
A 
Dancing 
Song,” 
has 
a 
somewhat 
similar 
rhyme 
scheme 
but 
strikes 
me 
as 
a 
much 
better 
poem 
than 
“From 
High 
Mountains.” 


I 
confess 
that 
I 
do 
not 
admire 
the 
present 
poem—except 
for 
one 
magnificent 
line 
which 
defies 
translation: 


Nur 
wer 
sich 
wandelt, 
bleibt 
mit 
mir 
verwandt. 


My 
version 
does 
not 
capture 
the 
play 
on 
words 
but 
tries 
to 
communicate 
the 
meaning: 
“One 
has 
to 
change 
to 
stay 
akin 
to 
me.” 
Or: 
“Only 
those 
who 
change 
remain 
related 
to 
me.” 
This 
rendering 
is 
far 
from 
perfect 
but 
it 
at 
least 
rectifies 
the 
misreading 
of 
the 
line 
in 
L. 
A. 
Magnus’ 
translation 
of 
the 
poem 
appended 
to 
Helen 
Zimmern’s 
version 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil: 
“None 
but 
new 
kith 
are 
native 
of 
my 
land!” 


Nietzsche 
had 
sent 
an 
earlier 
version2 
of 
this 
poem 
to 
Heinrich 
von 
Stein, 
with 
the 
comment: 
“This 
is 
for 
you, 
my 
dear 
friend, 
to 
remember 
Sils 
Maria 



and 
in 
gratitude 
for 
your 
letter, 
such 
a 
letter.”3 


In 
his 
reply 
the 
“dear 
friend” 
gave 
expression 
to 
his 
Wagner 
worship 
and 
asked 
Nietzsche 
to 
participate 
by 
letter 
in 
his 
weekly 
discussions 
with 
two 
friends 
about 
articles 
in 
the 
Wagner-Lexicon.4 


The 
poem 
seems 
sentimental 
to 
me, 
but 
Nietzsche 
did 
know 
loneliness 
as 
few 
men 
have 
ever 
known 
it.

—Ihr 
alten 
Freunde! 
Seht! 
Nun 
blickt 
ihr 
bleich, 


Voll 
Lieb’ 
und 
Grausen! 
Nein, 
geht! 
Zürnt 
nicht! 
Hier—könntet 
ihr 
nicht 
hausen: 
Hier 
zwischen 
fernstem 
Eis-und 
Felsenreich— 
Hier 
muss 
man 
Jäger 
sein 
und 
gemsengleich. 


Ein 
schlimmer 
Jäger 
ward 
ich!—Seht, 
wie 
steil 


Gespannt 
mein 
Bogen! 
Der 
Stärkste 
war’s, 
der 
solchen 
Zug 
gezogen——: 
Doch 
wehe 
nun! 
Gefährlich 
ist 
der 
Pfeil, 
Wie 
kein 
Pfeil,—fort 
von 
hier! 
Zu 
eurem 
Heil!… 


Ihr 
wendet 
euch?—Oh 
Herz, 
du 
trugst 
genung, 


Stark 
blieb

Halt 
neuen

deine 
Thüren

Die

Lass

Warst

du 
jung, 
jetzt—bist 
du 
besser 
jung! 


Was 
je 
uns 
knüpfte, 
Einer 
Hoffnung

Wer 
liest 
die

Die

einst

Dem 
Pergament

Nicht

das 
sind—wie 
nenn’ 
ich’s 
doch?— 


Nur 
Freunds-Gespenster! 
Das 
klopft 
mir 
wohl 
noch 
Nachts 
an 
Herz 
und 
Fenster, 
Das 
sieht 
mich 
an 
und 
spricht: 
“lwir 
waren’s

—Oh 
welkes 
Wort, 
das 
einst 
wie 
Rosen 
roch! 


Oh 
Jugend-Sehnen, 
das 
sich 
missverstand! 


Die 
ich 
ersehnte, 
Die 
ich 
mir 
selbst 
verwandt-verwandelt 
wähnte, 
Dass 
alt 
sie 
wurden, 
hat 
sie 
weggebannt: 
Nur 
wer 
sich 
wandelt, 
bleibt 
mit 
mir 
verwandt. 


Oh 
Lebens

Zweite 
Jugendzeit! 
Oh

Unruhig 
Glück

und

I 
sought 
where 
cutting 
winds 
are 
at 
their 
worst? 


I 
learned 
to 
dwell 
Where 
no 
one 
lives, 
in 
bleakest 
polar 
hell, 
Unlearned 
mankind 
and 
god, 
prayer 
and 
curse? 
Became 
a 
ghost 
that 
wanders 
over 
glaciers? 


—My 
ancient 
friends! 
Alas! 
You 
show 
the 
shock 


Of 
love 
and 
fear! 
No, 
leave! 
Do 
not 
be 
wroth! 
You—can’t 
live 
here— 
Here, 
among 
distant 
fields 
of 
ice 
and 
rock— 
Here 
one 
must 
be 
a 
hunter, 
chamois-like. 


A 
wicked 
archer 
I’ve 
become.—The 
ends 


Of 
my 
bow 
kiss; 
Only 
the 
strongest 
bends 
his 
bow 
like 
this. 
No 
arrow 
strikes 
like 
that 
which 
my 
bow 
sends: 
Away 
from 
here—for 
your 
own 
good, 
my 
friends!—— 



You 
leave?—My 
heart: 
no 
heart 
has 
borne 
worse 
hunger; 


Your 
hope 
stayed 
strong: 
Don’t 
shut 
your 
gates; 
new 
friends 
may 
come 
along. 
Let 
old 
ones 
go. 
Don’t 
be 
a 
memory-monger! 
Once 
you 
were 
young—now 
you 
are 
even 
younger. 


What 
once 
tied 
us 
together, 
one 
hope’s 
bond— 


Who 
reads 
the 
signs 
Love 
once 
inscribed 
on 
it, 
the 
pallid 
lines? 
To 
parchment 
I 
compare 
it 
that 
the 
hand 
Is 
loath 
to 
touch—discolored, 
dark, 
and 
burnt. 


No 
longer 
friends—there 
is 
no 
word 
for 
those— 


It 
is 
a 
wraith 
That 
knocks 
at 
night 
and 
tries 
to 
rouse 
my 
faith, 
And 
looks 
at 
me 
and 
says: 
“Once 
friendship 
was—” 
—O 
wilted 
word, 
once 
fragrant 
as 
the 
rose. 


Youth’s 
longing 
misconceived 
inconstancy. 


Those 
whom 
I 
deemed 
Changed 
to 
my 
kin, 
the 
friends 
of 
whom 
I 
dreamed, 
Have 
aged 
and 
lost 
our 
old 
affinity: 
One 
has 
to 
change 
to 
stay 
akin 
to 
me. 


O 
noon 
of 
life! 
Our 
second 
youthful 
state! 


O 
summer 
garden! 
Restlessly 
happy 
and 
expectant, 
standing, 
Der

Tag 
und 
Nacht

Der 
neuen

Kommt! 
’s

’s

Dies

Sehnsucht

Ein

Der 
Mittags-Freund—nein! 
fragt 
nicht,

es

Looking 
all

night, 
for 
friends 
I 
wait: 
For 
new

Come! 
It’s

It’s 
late! 



This 
song 
is 
over—longing’s 
dulcet 
cry 
Died 
in 
my 
mouth: 
A 
wizard 
did 
it, 
friend 
in 
time 
of 
drought, 
The 
friend 
of 
noon—no, 
do 
not 
ask 
me 
who— 
At 
noon 
it 
was 
that 
one 
turned 
into 
two—— 


Sure 
of 
our 
victory, 
we 
celebrate 
The 
feast 
of 
feasts: 
Friend 
Zarathustra 
came, 
the 
guest 
of 
guests! 
The 
world 
now 
laughs, 
rent 
are 
the 
drapes 
of 
fright, 
The 
wedding 
is 
at

of 
dark 
and

Editor’s 
Introduction 



1 


Of 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
books, 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals 
comes 
closest, 
at 
least 
in 
form, 
to 
Anglo-American 
philosophy: 
it 
consists 
of 
three 
inquiries, 
each 
self-contained 
and 
yet 
related 
to 
the 
other 
two. 
Even 
those 
who 
suppose, 
erroneously, 
that 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
is 
a 
book 
for 
browsing, 
a 
collection 
of 
aphorisms 
that 
may 
be 
read 
in 
any 
order 
whatever, 
generally 
recognize 
that 
the 
Genealogy 
comprises 
three 
essays. 
Moreover, 
all 
three 
essays 
deal 
with 
morality, 
a 
subject 
close 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
British 
and 
American 
philosophy; 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
manner 
is 
much 
more 
sober 
and 
single-minded 
than 
usual. 


Yet 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
title 
page 
is 
followed 
by 
these 
words: 
“A 
Sequel 
to 
My 
Last 
Book, 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
Which 
It 
Is 
Meant 
to 
Supplement 
and 
Clarify.”1 


In 
other 
words, 
Nietzsche 
did 
not 
suppose 
that 
the 
Genealogy 
could 
be 
readily 
understood 
by 
itself, 
and 
in 
the 
final 
section 
of 
the 
preface 
he 
explained 
emphatically 
at 
some 
length 
that 
he 
presupposed 
not 
only 
a 
passing 
acquaintance 
with 
his 
earlier 
books 
but 
actually 
a 
rather 
close 
study 
of 
them. 


Moreover, 
Nietzsche 
refers 
the 
reader, 
especially 
(but 
not 
only) 
in 
the 
preface, 
to 
a 
large 
number 
of 
specific 
passages 
in 
his 
earlier 
works. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
resent 
all 
this 
as 
tedious 
and 
self-important—and 
to 
misunderstand 
the 
book 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
philosophy 
generally. 
It 
is 
fashionable 
to 
read 
hastily, 
as 
if, 
for 
example, 
one 
knew 
all 
about 
Nietzsche’s 
contrast 
of 
master 
and 
slave 
morality 
before 
one 
had 
even 
begun 
to 
read 
him. 
But 
if 
one 
reads 
snippets 
here 
and 
there, 
projecting 
ill-founded 
preconceptions 
into 
the 
gaps, 
one 
is 
apt 
to 
misconstrue 
Nietzsche’s 
moral 
philosophy 
completely—as 
Loeb 
and 
Leopold 
did 
when, 
as 
youngsters, 
they 
supposed 
that 
a 
brutal 
and 
senseless 
murder 
would 
prove 
them 
masters. 
Similar 
misunderstandings 
mar 
many 
academic 
interpretations; 
but 
professors 
naturally 
react 
differently: 
they 
feel 
outraged 
by 
Nietzsche 
and 
do 
violence, 
on 
a 
different 
level, 
to 
him. 


To 
understand 
Nietzsche’s 
conceptions 
of 
master 
and 
slave 
morality, 
one 
should 
read 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
260, 
and 
Human, 
All-Too-
Human, 
section 
45—and 
keep 
in 
mind 
the 
title 
of 
our 
book, 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
origins 
of 
morality. 
Nietzsche 
distinguishes 
moralities 
that 
originated 
in 



ruling 
classes 
from 
moralities 
that 
originated 
among 
the 
oppressed. 


Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
the 
aphoristic 
material 
in 
his 
earlier 
works 
to 
which 
Nietzsche 
refers 
us 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
come 
by, 
and 
the 
larger 
part 
of 
it 
has 
never 
been 
translated 
adequately. 
Most 
of 
these 
aphorisms 
have 
therefore 
been 
included 
in 
the 
present 
volume, 
in 
new 
translations. 
And 
some 
commentary, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
footnotes, 
may 
not 
be 
supererogatory. 


The 
extent 
of 
such 
a 
commentary 
poses 
insoluble 
problems: 
if 
there 
is 
too 
little 
of 
it, 
students 
may 
feel 
that 
they 
get 
no 
help 
where 
they 
need 
it; 
if 
there 
is 
too 
much, 
it 
becomes 
an 
affront 
to 
the 
reader’s 
knowledge 
and 
intelligence 
and 
a 
monument 
of 
pedantry. 
No 
mean 
can 
possibly 
be 
right 
for 
all. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
his 
Preface 
Nietzsche 
says 
that 
it 
won’t 
do 
simply 
to 
read 
an 
aphorism, 
one 
must 
also 
decipher 
it; 
and 
he 
claims 
that 
his 
whole 
third 
inquiry 
is 
a 
paradigm 
case 
of 
a 
commentary 
on 
a 
single 
aphorism. 
Taking 
my 
cue 
from 
this 
suggestion, 
I 
have 
selected 
one 
exceptionally 
interesting 
section 
in 
the 
third 
essay 
and 
given 
it 
a 
much 
more 
detailed 
commentary 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
book: 
section 
24, 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
intellectual 
conscience 
and 
with 
truth. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
to 
suggest 
that 
this 
section 
is 
self-contained; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
argument 
is 
continued 
in 
the 
following 
section—and 
so 
is 
the 
commentary. 



2 


The 
title 
of 
our 
book 
is 
ambiguous, 
but 
it 
is 
clear 
which 
meaning 
Nietzsche 
intended. 
Zur 
Genealogie 
der 
Moral 
could 
mean 
“Toward 
a 
(literally, 
“Toward 
the”) 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals” 
(or 
Morality); 
it 
could 
also 
mean—and 
does 
mean—“On 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals.” 
How 
can 
one 
tell? 


There 
is 
one, 
and 
only 
one, 
sure 
way. 
In 
many 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
books, 
the 
aphorisms 
or 
sections 
have 
brief 
titles; 
and 
several 
of 
these 
(about 
two 
dozen) 
begin 
with 
the 
word 
Zur. 
So 
do 
a 
great 
many 
of 
his 
notes, 
including 
more 
than 
two 
dozen 
of 
those 
included 
in 
the 
posthumous 
collection, 
The 
Will 
to 
Power. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
notes, 
to 
be 
sure, 
the 
titles 
were 
sometimes 
added 
by 
Peter 
Gast, 
Nietzsche’s 
worshipful 
friend 
and 
editor; 
but 
even 
titles 
contributed 
by 
Gast 
have 
some 
evidential 
value, 
as 
he 
had 
presumably 
acquired 
some 
feeling 
for 
Nietzsche’s 
usage. 


The 
upshot: 
In 
no 
title 
does 
Nietzsche’s 
Zur 
or 
Zum 
clearly 
mean 
“Toward,” 
and 
he 
used 
Zur 
again 
and 
again 
in 
contexts 
in 
which 
“Toward” 
makes 
no 
sense 
at 
all, 
and 
“On” 
is 
the 
only 
possible 
meaning; 
for 
example, 
the 
heading 
of 
section 
381, 
in 
the 
fifth 
book 
of 
The 
Gay 
Science—published 
in 
1887 
as 
was 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals—reads: 
Zur 
Frage 
der 
Verständlichkeit, 
“On 
the 
Question 
of 
Being 
Understandable.” 
To 
be 
sure, 
if 
that 
same 
phrase 
were 
found 
in 
Heidegger, 
one 
would 
not 
hesitate 
to 
translate 
it, 
“toward 
the 
question 
of 
understandability”: 
Heidegger 
is 
always 
on 
the 
way 
toward 
the 
point 
from 
which 
it 
may 
be 
possible 
some 
day 
to 
ask 
a 
question. 
But 
not 
Nietzsche. 
It 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
know 
the 
language; 
one 
must 
also 
acquire 
some 
feeling 
for 
an 
author. 
Toward 
the 
latter 
end, 
an 
excellent 
prescription 
would 
be 
to 
read 
Nietzsche 
“On 
the 
Question 
of 
Being 
Understandable”; 
and 
this 
aphorism 
is 
included 
in 
the 
present 
volume. 



3 


Speaking 
of 
intelligibility: 
why 
does 
Nietzsche 
use 
the 
French 
word 
ressentiment? 
First 
of 
all, 
the 
German 
language 
lacks 
any 
close 
equivalent 
to 
the 
French 
term. 
That 
alone 
would 
be 
sufficient 
excuse 
for 
Nietzsche, 
though 
perhaps 
not 
for 
a 
translator, 
who 
could 
use 
“resentment.” 


Secondly, 
Nietzsche’s 
emergence 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
Wagner, 
who 
extolled 
everything 
Germanic 
and 
excoriated 
the 
French, 
was 
marked 
by 
an 
attitude 
more 
Francophile 
than 
that 
of 
any 
other 
major 
German 
writer—at 
least 
since 
Leibniz 
(1646–1716), 
who 
preferred 
to 
write 
in 
French. 
Nietzsche 
saw 
himself 
as 
the 
heir 
of 
the 
French 
moralistes 
and 
as 
a 
“good 
European.” 


In 
1805 
Hegel 
wrote 
to 
Johann 
Heinrich 
Voss, 
who 
had 
translated 
Homer 
into 
German 
dactylic 
hexameters: 
“I 
should 
like 
to 
say 
of 
my 
aspirations 
that 
I 
shall 
try 
to 
teach 
philosophy 
to 
speak 
German.”2 


Avoiding 
Greek, 
Latin, 
and 
French 
terms, 
Hegel 
created 
an 
involved 
German 
terminology, 
devising 
elaborate 
locutions 
that 
make 
his 
prose 
utterly 
forbidding. 
And 
a 
little 
over 
a 
century 
later, 
Heidegger 
tried 
to 
do 
much 
the 
same 
thing. 
Yet 
Hegel 
was 
assuredly 
wrong 
when 
he 
went 
on 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
next 
sentence 
of 
his 
letter: 
“Once 
that 
is 
accomplished, 
it 
will 
be 
infinitely 
more 
difficult 
to 
give 
shallowness 
the 
appearance 
of 
profound 
speech.” 
On 
the 
contrary. 
Nothing 
serves 
as 
well 
as 
obscurity 
to 
make 
shallowness 
look 
profound. 


Modern 
readers 
who 
do 
not 
know 
foreign 
languages 
may 
wonder 
whether 
Nietzsche’s 
abundant 
use 
of 
French 
phrases, 
and 
occasionally 
also 
of 
Latin, 
Greek, 
and 
Italian 
(sometimes 
he 
uses 
English 
words, 
too) 
does 
not 
make 
for 
obscurity. 
If 
it 
does, 
this 
is 
obscurity 
of 
an 
altogether 
different 
kind 
and 
easily 
removed—by 
a 
brief 
footnote, 
for 
example. 
Nietzsche 
likes 
brevity 
as 
much 
as 
he 
likes 
being 
a 
good 
European; 
and 
he 
hates 
nationalism 
as 
much 
as 
he 
hates 
saying 
approximately, 
at 
great 
length, 
what 
can 
be 
said 
precisely, 
in 
one 
word. 


One 
is 
tempted 
to 
add 
that 
the 
kind 
of 
obscurantism 
he 
abominated 
involves 
irremediable 
ambiguities 
which 
lead 
to 
endless 
discussion, 
while 
his 
terms, 
whether 
German 
or 
foreign, 
are 
unequivocal. 
That 
is 
true 
up 
to 
a 
point 



—but 
not 
quite. 
Nietzsche 
had 
an 
almost 
pathological 
weakness 
for 
one 
particular 
kind 
of 
ambiguity, 
which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
is 
not 
irremediable: 
he 
loved 
words 
and 
phrases 
that 
mean 
one 
thing 
out 
of 
context 
and 
almost 
the 
opposite 
in 
the 
context 
he 
gives 
them. 
He 
loved 
language 
as 
poets 
do 
and 
relished 
these 
“revaluations.” 
All 
of 
them 
involve 
a 
double 
meaning, 
one 
exoteric 
and 
one 
esoteric, 
one—to 
put 
it 
crudely—wrong, 
and 
the 
other 
right. 
The 
former 
is 
bound 
to 
lead 
astray 
hasty 
readers, 
browsers, 
and 
that 
rapidly 
growing 
curse 
of 
our 
time—the 
non-readers 
who 
do 
not 
realize 
that 
galloping 
consumption 
is 
a 
disease. 


The 
body 
of 
knowledge 
keeps 
increasing 
at 
incredible 
speed, 
but 
the 
literature 
of 
nonknowledge 
grows 
even 
faster. 
Books 
multiply 
like 
mushrooms, 
or 
rather 
like 
toadstools—mildew 
would 
be 
still 
more 
precise— 
and 
even 
those 
who 
read 
books 
come 
perforce 
to 
depend 
more 
and 
more 
on 
knowledge 
about 
books, 
writers, 
and, 
if 
at 
all 
possible—for 
this 
is 
the 
intellectual, 
or 
rather 
the 
nonintellectual, 
equivalent 
of 
a 
bargain 
—movements. 
As 
long 
as 
one 
knows 
about 
existentialism, 
one 
can 
talk 
about 
a 
large 
number 
of 
authors 
without 
having 
actually 
read 
their 
books. 


Nietzsche 
diagnosed 
this 
disease 
in 
its 
early 
stages, 
long 
before 
it 
had 
reached 
its 
present 
proportions—yet 
wrote 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
insured 
his 
being 
misunderstood 
by 
the 
kind 
of 
reader 
and 
nonreader 
he 
despised. 
Why? 
He 
gave 
reasons 
more 
than 
once; 
for 
example, 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
sections 
30, 
40, 
230, 
270, 
278, 
289, 
and 
290, 
and 
in 
the 
aforementioned 
section 
381 
of 
The 
Gay 
Science. 
And 
I 
have 
attempted 
a 
different 
sort 
of 
explanation 
in 
an 
essay 
on 
“Philosophy 
versus 
Poetry.”3 


The 
Genealogy 
contains 
several 
examples 
of 
misleading 
slogans, 
but 
ressentiment 
is 
actually 
not 
one 
of 
them. 
That 
term 
is 
univocal, 
but—to 
ask 
this 
once 
more—why 
couldn’t 
we 
substitute 
“resentment” 
for 
it 
in 
an 
English 
translation? 
Apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
something 
of 
the 
flavor 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
style 
and 
thought 
would 
be 
lost, 
this 
is 
a 
point 
at 
which 
Nietzsche 
succeeded 
in 
teaching 
psychology 
to 
speak—Nietzschean. 
His 
conception 
of 
ressentiment 
constitutes 
one 
of 
his 
major 
contributions 
to 
psychology—and 
helps 
to 
illuminate 
the 
widespread 
misunderstanding 
of 
Nietzsche. 


To 
begin 
with 
the 
first 
point: 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
own 
lengthy 
essay 
on 
“[The 
role 
of] 
Ressentiment 
in 
the 
Construction 
of 
Moralities,”4 


Max 
Scheler 
says: 
“Among 
the 
exceedingly 
few 
discoveries 
made 
in 
recent 
times 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
moral 
value 
judgments, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsche’s 
discovery 
of 
ressentiment 
as 
the 
source 
of 
such 
value 
judgments 



is 
the 
most 
profound, 
even 
if 
his 
more 
specific 
claim 
that 
Christian 
morality 
and 
in 
particular 
Christian 
love 
are 
the 
finest 
‘flower 
of 
resssentiment’ 
should 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
false.”5 


Scheler, 
one 
of 
the 
outstanding 
German 
philosophers 
of 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
converted 
to 
Roman 
Catholicism 
and 
persuaded 
some 
of 
his 
disciples 
to 
follow 
his 
example—but 
later 
abandoned 
Christianity 
as 
well 
as 
all 
theism. 
In 
the 
essay 
on 
ressentiment 
he 
argued: 
“We 
believe 
that 
Christian 
values 
are 
particularly 
prone 
to 
being 
reinterpreted 
into 
values 
of 
ressentiment 
and 
have 
also 
been 
understood 
that 
way 
particularly 
often, 
but 
that 
the 
core 
of 
Christian 
ethics 
did 
not 
grow 
on 
the 
soil 
of 
ressentiment. 
Yet 
we 
also 
believe 
that 
the 
core 
of 
bourgeois 
morality, 
which 
since 
the 
thirteenth 
century 
has 
begun 
more 
and 
more 
to 
supersede 
Christian 
morality 
until 
it 
attained 
its 
supreme 
achievement 
in 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
does 
have 
its 
roots 
in 
ressentiment.” 
Even 
where 
he 
disagreed 
with 
Nietzsche, 
Scheler 
emphasized 
that 
he 
considered 
Nietzsche’s 
account 
singularly 
profound 
and 
worthy 
of 
the 
most 
serious 
consideration.6 


Readers 
ready 
to 
jump 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
Nietzsche 
confounded 
true 
Christianity 
with 
its 
bourgeois 
misinterpretation 
while 
Scheler 
obviously 
understood 
Christianity 
far 
better 
should 
ponder 
Scheler’s 
footnote: 
“The 
possible 
unity 
of 
style 
of 
warlike 
and 
Christian 
morality 
is 
demonstrated 
in 
detail 
in 
my 
book 
Der 
Genius 
des 
Krieges 
und 
der 
deutsche 
Krieg 
(The 
genius 
of 
war 
and 
the 
German 
war), 
1915.”7 


To 
be 
sure, 
most 
Christians 
in 
England, 
France, 
and 
the 
United 
States 
felt 
the 
same 
way 
in 
1915, 
but 
the 
question 
remains 
whether 
Scheler’s 
reading 
of 
Christianity 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
be 
heard 
gladly 
in 
the 
twentieth 
century, 
around 
1915, 
when 
the 
essay 
on 
ressentiment, 
too, 
appeared. 
In 
any 
case, 
this 
essay 
does 
not 
compare 
in 
originality 
and 
importance 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
Genealogy, 
but 
it 
deserves 
mention 
as 
an 
attempt 
to 
develop 
Nietzsche’s 
ideas, 
and 
it 
shows 
how 
the 
term 
ressentiment 
has 
become 
established. 


Nietzsche’s 
conception 
of 
ressentiment 
also 
throws 
light 
on 
the 
reception 
of 
his 
ideas. 
By 
way 
of 
contrast, 
consider 
Max 
Weber, 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
sociologist 
of 
the 
century, 
and 
certainly 
one 
of 
the 
greatest. 
Weber’s 
sociology 
of 
religion 
owes 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
Genealogy. 
But 
why 
is 
it 
generally 
recognized 
that 
Weber 
was 
by 
no 
means 
an 
anti-Semite, 
although 
he 
found 
the 
clue 
to 
the 
Jewish 
religion 
in 
the 
alleged 
fact 
that 
the 
Jews 
were 
a 
pariah 
people, 
while 
Nietzsche’s 
comments 
on 
slave 
morality 
and 
the 
slave 
rebellion 
in 
morals 
have 
so 
often 
been 
considered 
highly 
offensive 
and 
tinged 



by 
anti-Semitism? 
(Nietzsche’s 
many 
references 
to 
anti-Semitism 
are 
invariably 
scathing: 
see 
the 
indices 
in 
this 
volume.) 
Could 
it 
be 
that 
a 
scholar 
is 
given 
the 
benefit 
of 
every 
doubt 
so 
long 
as 
he 
does 
not 
have 
the 
presumption 
to 
write 
well? 


To 
write 
about 
Nietzsche 
“scholars” 
with 
the 
lack 
of 
inhibition 
with 
which 
they 
have 
written 
about 
Nietzsche, 
mixing 
moralistic 
denunciations 
with 
attempts 
at 
psychiatric 
explanations, 
would 
be 
utterly 
unthinkable. 
Why? 
The 
answer 
is 
clearly 
not 
that 
Nietzsche 
really 
was 
an 
inferior 
scholar 
and 
did 
eventually 
become 
insane. 
Most 
Nietzsche 
“scholars” 
cannot 
hold 
a 
candle 
to 
his 
learning 
or 
originality, 
and 
the 
closer 
they 
are 
to 
meriting 
psychological 
explanations, 
the 
worse 
it 
would 
be 
to 
offer 
any. 


Could 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
disparity 
in 
treatment 
be 
that 
Nietzsche 
is 
dead? 
We 
are 
in 
no 
danger 
of 
hurting 
his 
feelings 
or 
his 
career; 
and 
he 
cannot 
hit 
back. 
He 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
member 
of 
the 
family; 
he 
has 
left 
us 
and 
is 
fair 
game. 
But 
Max 
Weber 
is 
dead, 
too; 
yet 
he 
is 
still 
treated 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
guild. 
Clearly, 
there 
must 
be 
another 
reason. 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
too 
well 
and 
was 
too 
superior. 
That 
removed 
him 
from 
the 
immunity 
of 
our 
community, 
quite 
as 
much 
as 
the 
commission 
of 
a 
crime. 
But 
where 
the 
transgression 
has 
been 
spiritual 
or 
intellectual, 
and 
those 
offended 
are 
the 
intellectual 
community, 
the 
revenge, 
too, 
is 
intellectual. 
The 
pent-up 
resentment 
against 
fellow 
members 
of 
the 
community—sloppy 
scholars 
and 
writers 
as 
well 
as 
those 
who 
excite 
envy—all 
this 
rancor 
that 
cannot 
be 
vented 
against 
living 
colleagues, 
at 
least 
not 
in 
print, 
may 
be 
poured 
out 
against 
a 
few 
great 
scapegoats. 


There 
are 
many 
reasons 
for 
Nietzsche’s 
being 
one 
of 
the 
great 
scapegoats 
of 
all 
time. 
During 
World 
War 
I 
British 
intellectuals 
found 
it 
convenient 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
war 
effort 
by 
denouncing 
a 
German 
intellectual 
of 
stature 
whom 
one 
could 
discuss 
in 
print 
without 
losing 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
reading 
him— 
and 
Nietzsche 
had 
said 
many 
nasty 
things 
about 
the 
British.8 


Henceforth 
Nietzsche 
was 
a 
marked 
man, 
and 
World 
War 
II 
contributed 
its 
share 
to 
this 
type 
of 
disgraceful 
literature. 
But 
there 
are 
even 
more 
such 
studies 
in 
German—which 
is 
scarcely 
surprising. 
After 
all, 
Nietzsche 
said 
far 
more 
wicked 
things—incomparably 
more 
and 
worse—about 
the 
Germans 
than 
he 
ever 
did 
about 
the 
British. 
And 
as 
the 
literature 
shows 
us 
beyond 
a 
doubt: 
Christian 
scholars 
also 
needed 
outlets 
for 
their 
rancor. 
For 
all 
that, 
it 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
think 
in 
terms 
of 
any 
strict 
tit-for-tat, 
as 
if 
each 
group 
the 
dead 
man 
had 
offended 
then 
felt 
justified 
in 
hitting 
back 
once 
he 
was 
dead. 



Once 
it 
was 
established 
that 
this 
writer 
was 
a 
scapegoat, 
anybody 
was 
allowed 
to 
play 
and 
vent 
his 
own 
ressentiment 
on 
him, 
no 
matter 
what 
its 
source. 


Apart 
from 
these 
considerations, 
Nietzsche’s 
reception 
cannot 
be 
understood. 
To 
be 
sure, 
reactions 
of 
that 
sort 
do 
not 
exhaust 
this 
story. 
There 
is 
also 
Nietzsche’s 
influence 
on 
Rilke 
and 
German 
poetry, 
on 
Thomas 
Mann 
and 
the 
German 
novel, 
on 
Karl 
Jaspers 
and 
German 
philosophy, 
on 
Gide 
and 
Malraux, 
Sartre 
and 
Camus, 
Freud 
and 
Buber, 
Shaw 
and 
Yeats. 
But 
to 
understand 
that, 
one 
only 
has 
to 
read 
them—and 
him. 



4 


One 
final 
word 
about 
the 
contents 
and 
spirit 
of 
the 
Genealogy. 
All 
three 
inquiries 
deal 
with 
the 
origins 
of 
moral 
phenomena, 
as 
the 
title 
of 
the 
book 
indicates. 
The 
first 
essay, 
which 
contrasts 
“Good 
and 
Evil” 
with 
“Good 
and 
Bad,” 
juxtaposes 
master 
and 
slave 
morality; 
the 
second 
essay 
considers 
“guilt,” 
the 
“bad 
conscience,” 
and 
related 
matters; 
and 
the 
third, 
ascetic 
ideals. 
The 
most 
common 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
book 
is 
surely 
to 
suppose 
that 
Nietzsche 
considers 
slave 
morality, 
the 
bad 
conscience, 
and 
ascetic 
ideals 
evil; 
that 
he 
suggests 
that 
mankind 
would 
be 
better 
off 
if 
only 
these 
things 
had 
never 
appeared; 
and 
that 
in 
effect 
he 
glorifies 
unconscionable 
brutes. 


Any 
such 
view 
is 
wrong 
in 
detail 
and 
can 
be 
refuted 
both 
by 
considering 
in 
context 
the 
truncated 
quotations 
that 
have 
been 
adduced 
to 
buttress 
it 
and 
by 
citing 
a 
large 
number 
of 
other 
passages. 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
do 
this 
in 
my 
book 
on 
Nietzsche,9 
and 
this 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
repeat 
the 
demonstration. 
But 
this 
sort 
of 
misinterpretation 
involves 
not 
only 
hundreds 
of 
particular 
misreadings, 
it 
also 
involves 
a 
misreading 
of 
the 
Genealogy 
and, 
even 
more 
generally, 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
attitude 
toward 
history 
and 
the 
world. 
In 
conclusion, 
something 
needs 
to 
be 
said 
about 
that. 


The 
Genealogy 
is 
intended 
as 
a 
supplement 
and 
clarification 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil. 
And 
while 
that 
title 
suggests 
an 
attempt 
to 
rise 
above 
the 
slave 
morality 
that 
contrasts 
good 
and 
evil, 
it 
also 
signifies 
a 
very 
broad 
attack 
on 
“the 
faith 
in 
opposite 
values.”10 


Decidedly, 
it 
is 
not 
Nietzsche’s 
concern 
in 
the 
Genealogy 
to 
tell 
us 
that 
master 
morality 
is 
good, 
while 
slave 
morality 
is 
evil; 
or 
to 
persuade 
us 
that 
the 
bad 
conscience 
and 
ascetic 
ideals 
are 
bad, 
while 
a 
brutish 
state 
antedating 
both 
phenomena 
is 
good. 
Of 
course, 
it 
is 
his 
plan 
to 
open 
new 
perspectives 
and 
to 
make 
us 
see 
what 
he 
discusses 
in 
unwonted, 
different 
ways. 
If 
you 
are 
bent 
on 
using 
terms 
like 
good 
and 
bad, 
you 
might 
say 
that 
he 
tries 
to 
show 
us, 
among 
other 
things, 
how 
moral 
valuations, 
phenomena, 
and 
ideals 
that 
are 
usually 
not 
questioned 
have 
their 
bad 
or 
dark 
side. 
Ordinarily, 
we 
see 
the 
foreground 
only; 
Nietzsche 
seeks 
to 
show 
us 
the 
background. 


In 
a 
nutshell: 
when 
Nietzsche 
has 
shown 
us 
the 
dark 
side 
of 
the 
bad 



conscience, 
he 
says, 
“The 
bad 
conscience 
is 
an 
illness, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
about 
that, 
but 
an 
illness 
as 
pregnancy 
is 
an 
illness” 
(II, 
section 
19). 
His 
love 
of 
fate, 
his 
amor 
fati, 
should 
not 
be 
forgotten. 
The 
second 
chapter 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
ends: 
“My 
formula 
for 
greatness 
in 
a 
human 
being 
is 
amor 
fati: 
that 
one 
wants 
nothing 
to 
be 
different, 
not 
forward, 
not 
backward, 
not 
in 
all 
eternity. 
Not 
merely 
to 
bear 
what 
is 
necessary, 
still 
less 
conceal 
it—all 
idealism 
is 
mendaciousness 
in 
the 
face 
of 
what 
is 
necessary—but 
love 
it.” 


In 
the 
imagery 
of 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
Zarathustra, 
it 
is 
not 
Nietzsche’s 
intention 
to 
malign 
or 
to 
glorify 
either 
the 
camel 
or 
the 
lion—either 
the 
ascetic 
“spirit 
that 
would 
bear 
much, 
and 
kneels 
down 
like 
a 
camel” 
or 
the 
blond 
beast. 
Indeed, 
Zarathustra 
is 
eloquent 
in 
his 
praise 
of 
the 
camel, 
and 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
much 
of 
his 
description 
fits 
Nietzsche 
himself, 
who 
was 
certainly 
no 
stranger 
to 
ascetic 
ideals. 
But 
the 
point 
is 
that 
both 
camel 
and 
lion 
represent 
mere 
stages 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
spirit; 
and 
insofar 
as 
Nietzsche 
feels 
dissatisfied 
with 
both, 
it 
is 
because 
he 
would 
not 
have 
us 
settle 
for 
either: 
he 
wants 
us 
to 
climb 
higher—which, 
however, 
cannot 
be 
done 
without 
passing 
through 
these 
stages. 
And 
what 
lies 
beyond? 
What 
is 
the 
goal? 
Here 
we 
return 
to 
the 
image 
of 
pregnancy: 
the 
third 
stage 
is 
represented 
by 
the 
child. 
“The 
child 
is 
innocence 
and 
forgetting, 
a 
new 
beginning, 
a 
game, 
a 
self-propelled 
wheel, 
a 
first 
movement, 
a 
sacred 
‘Yes.’ 
For 
the 
game 
of 
creation, 
my 
brothers, 
a 
sacred 
‘Yes’ 
is 
needed.” 


Without 
acquiring 
a 
bad 
conscience, 
without 
learning 
to 
be 
profoundly 
dissatisfied 
with 
ourselves, 
we 
cannot 
envisage 
higher 
norms, 
a 
new 
state 
of 
being, 
self-perfection. 
Without 
ascetic 
ideals, 
without 
self-control 
and 
cruel 
self-discipline, 
we 
cannot 
attain 
that 
self-mastery 
which 
Nietzsche 
ever 
praises 
and 
admires. 
But 
to 
settle 
down 
with 
a 
nagging 
bad 
conscience, 
to 
remain 
an 
ascetic 
and 
mortify 
oneself, 
is 
to 
fall 
short 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
“Dionysian” 
vision. 
What 
he 
celebrates 
is 
neither 
the 
camel 
nor 
the 
lion 
but 
the 
creator. 


“Goethe 
… 
fought 
the 
mutual 
extraneousness 
of 
reason, 
senses, 
feeling, 
and 
will 
… 
he 
disciplined 
himself 
into 
wholeness, 
he 
created 
himself.… 
Such 
a 
spirit 
who 
has 
become 
free 
stands 
amid 
the 
cosmos 
with 
a 
joyous 
and 
trusting 
fatalism, 
in 
the 
faith 
… 
that 
all 
is 
redeemed 
and 
affirmed 
in 
the 
whole—he 
does 
not 
negate 
any 
more. 
Such 
a 
faith, 
however, 
is 
the 
highest 
of 
all 
possible 
faiths: 
I 
have 
baptized 
it 
with 
the 
name 
of 
Dionysus”11

Preface 



1 


We 
are 
unknown 
to 
ourselves, 
we 
men 
of 
knowledge—and 
with 
good 
reason. 
We 
have 
never 
sought 
ourselves—how 
could 
it 
happen 
that 
we 
should 
ever 
find 
ourselves? 
It 
has 
rightly 
been 
said: 
“Where 
your 
treasure 
is, 
there 
will 
your 
heart 
be 
also”;1 
our 
treasure 
is 
where 
the 
beehives 
of 
our 
knowledge 
are. 
We 
are 
constantly 
making 
for 
them, 
being 
by 
nature 
winged 
creatures 
and 
honey-gatherers 
of 
the 
spirit; 
there 
is 
one 
thing 
alone 
we 
really 
care 
about 
from 
the 
heart—“bringing 
something 
home.” 
Whatever 
else 
there 
is 
in 
life, 
so-called 
“experiences”—which 
of 
us 
has 
sufficient 
earnestness 
for 
them? 
Or 
sufficient 
time? 
Present 
experience 
has, 
I 
am 
afraid, 
always 
found 
us 
“absent-minded”: 
we 
cannot 
give 
our 
hearts 
to 
it—not 
even 
our 
ears! 
Rather, 
as 
one 
divinely 
preoccupied 
and 
immersed 
in 
himself 
into 
whose 
ear 
the 
bell 
has 
just 
boomed 
with 
all 
its 
strength 
the 
twelve 
beats 
of 
noon 
suddenly 
starts 
up 
and 
asks 
himself: 
“what 
really 
was 
that 
which 
just 
struck?” 
so 
we 
sometimes 
rub 
our 
ears 
afterward 
and 
ask, 
utterly 
surprised 
and 
disconcerted, 
“what 
really 
was 
that 
which 
we 
have 
just 
experienced?” 
and 
moreover: 
“who 
are 
we 
really?” 
and, 
afterward 
as 
aforesaid, 
count 
the 
twelve 
trembling 
bell-strokes 
of 
our 
experience, 
our 
life, 
our 
being—and 
alas! 
miscount 
them.—So 
we 
are 
necessarily 
strangers 
to 
ourselves, 
we 
do 
not 
comprehend 
ourselves, 
we 
have 
to 
misunderstand 
ourselves, 
for 
us 
the 
law 
“Each 
is 
furthest 
from 
himself” 
applies 
to 
all 
eternity—we 
are 
not 
“men 
of 
knowledge” 
with 
respect 
to 
ourselves. 



2 


My 
ideas 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
our 
moral 
prejudices—for 
this 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
this 
polemic—received 
their 
first, 
brief, 
and 
provisional 
expression 
in 
the 
collection 
of 
aphorisms 
that 
bears 
the 
title 
Human, 
All-Too-Human. 
A 
Book 
for 
Free 
Spirits. 
This 
book 
was 
begun 
in 
Sorrento 
during 
a 
winter 
when 
it 
was 
given 
to 
me 
to 
pause 
as 
a 
wanderer 
pauses 
and 
look 
back 
across 
the 
broad 
and 
dangerous 
country 
my 
spirit 
had 
traversed 
up 
to 
that 
time. 
This 
was 
in 
the 
winter 
of 
1876–77; 
the 
ideas 
themselves 
are 
older. 
They 
were 
already 
in 
essentials 
the 
same 
ideas 
that 
I 
take 
up 
again 
in 
the 
present 
treatises 
—let 
us 
hope 
the 
long 
interval 
has 
done 
them 
good, 
that 
they 
have 
become 
riper, 
clearer, 
stronger, 
more 
perfect! 
That 
I 
still 
cleave 
to 
them 
today, 
however, 
that 
they 
have 
become 
in 
the 
meantime 
more 
and 
more 
firmly 
attached 
to 
one 
another, 
indeed 
entwined 
and 
interlaced 
with 
one 
another, 
strengthens 
my 
joyful 
assurance 
that 
they 
might 
have 
arisen 
in 
me 
from 
the 
first 
not 
as 
isolated, 
capricious, 
or 
sporadic 
things 
but 
from 
a 
common 
root, 
from 
a 
fundamental 
will 
of 
knowledge, 
pointing 
imperiously 
into 
the 
depths, 
speaking 
more 
and 
more 
precisely, 
demanding 
greater 
and 
greater 
precision. 
For 
this 
alone 
is 
fitting 
for 
a 
philosopher. 
We 
have 
no 
right 
to 
isolated 
acts 
of 
any 
kind: 
we 
may 
not 
make 
isolated 
errors 
or 
hit 
upon 
isolated 
truths. 
Rather 
do 
our 
ideas, 
our 
values, 
our 
yeas 
and 
nays, 
our 
ifs 
and 
buts, 
grow 
out 
of 
us 
with 
the 
necessity 
with 
which 
a 
tree 
bears 
fruit—related 
and 
each 
with 
an 
affinity 
to 
each, 
and 
evidence 
of 
one 
will, 
one 
health, 
one 
soil, 
one 
sun.— 
Whether 
you 
like 
them, 
these 
fruits 
of 
ours?—But 
what 
is 
that 
to 
the 
trees! 
What 
is 
that 
to 
us, 
to 
us 
philosophers! 



3 


Because 
of 
a 
scruple 
peculiar 
to 
me 
that 
I 
am 
loth 
to 
admit 
to—for 
it 
is 
concerned 
with 
morality, 
with 
all 
that 
has 
hitherto 
been 
celebrated 
on 
earth 
as 
morality—a 
scruple 
that 
entered 
my 
life 
so 
early, 
so 
uninvited, 
so 
irresistibly, 
so 
much 
in 
conflict 
with 
my 
environment, 
age, 
precedents, 
and 
descent 
that 
I 
might 
almost 
have 
the 
right 
to 
call 
it 
my 
“a 
priori”—my 
curiosity 
as 
well 
as 
my 
suspicions 
were 
bound 
to 
halt 
quite 
soon 
at 
the 
question 
of 
where 
our 
good 
and 
evil 
really 
originated. 
In 
fact, 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
evil 
pursued 
me 
even 
as 
a 
boy 
of 
thirteen: 
at 
an 
age 
in 
which 
you 
have 
“half 
childish 
trifles, 
half 
God 
in 
your 
heart,”2 


I 
devoted 
to 
it 
my 
first 
childish 
literary 
trifle, 
my 
first 
philosophical 
effort 
—and 
as 
for 
the 
“solution” 
of 
the 
problem 
I 
posed 
at 
that 
time, 
well, 
I 
gave 
the 
honor 
to 
God, 
as 
was 
only 
fair, 
and 
made 
him 
the 
father 
of 
evil. 
Was 
that 
what 
my 
“a 
priori” 
demanded 
of 
me? 
that 
new 
immoral, 
or 
at 
least 
unmoralistic 
“a 
priori” 
and 
the 
alas! 
so 
anti-Kantian, 
enigmatic 
“categorical 
imperative” 
which 
spoke 
through 
it 
and 
to 
which 
I 
have 
since 
listened 
more 
and 
more 
closely, 
and 
not 
merely 
listened? 


Fortunately 
I 
learned 
early 
to 
separate 
theological 
prejudice 
from 
moral 
prejudice 
and 
ceased 
to 
look 
for 
the 
origin 
of 
evil 
behind 
the 
world. 
A 
certain 
amount 
of 
historical 
and 
philological 
schooling, 
together 
with 
an 
inborn 
fastidiousness 
of 
taste 
in 
respect 
to 
psychological 
questions 
in 
general, 
soon 
transformed 
my 
problem 
into 
another 
one: 
under 
what 
conditions 
did 
man 
devise 
these 
value 
judgments 
good 
and 
evil? 
and 
what 
value 
do 
they 
themselves 
possess? 
Have 
they 
hitherto 
hindered 
or 
furthered 
human 
prosperity? 
Are 
they 
a 
sign 
of 
distress, 
of 
impoverishment, 
of 
the 
degeneration 
of 
life? 
Or 
is 
there 
revealed 
in 
them, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
plenitude, 
force, 
and 
will 
of 
life, 
its 
courage, 
certainty, 
future? 


Thereupon 
I 
discovered 
and 
ventured 
divers 
answers; 
I 
distinguished 
between 
ages, 
peoples, 
degrees 
of 
rank 
among 
individuals; 
departmentalized 
my 
problem; 
out 
of 
my 
answers 
there 
grew 
new 
questions, 
inquiries, 
conjectures, 
probabilities—until 
at 
length 
I 
had 
a 
country 
of 
my 
own, 
a 
soil 
of 
my 
own, 
an 
entire 
discrete, 
thriving, 
flourishing 
world, 
like 
a 



secret 
garden 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
no 
one 
suspected.—Oh 
how 
fortunate 
we 
are, 
we 
men 
of 
knowledge, 
provided 
only 
that 
we 
know 
how 
to 
keep 
silent 
long 
enough! 



4 


The 
first 
impulse 
to 
publish 
something 
of 
my 
hypotheses 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
morality 
was 
given 
me 
by 
a 
clear, 
tidy, 
and 
shrewd—also 
precocious—little 
book 
in 
which 
I 
encountered 
distinctly 
for 
the 
first 
time 
an 
upside-down 
and 
perverse 
species 
of 
genealogical 
hypothesis, 
the 
genuinely 
English 
type, 
that 
attracted 
me—with 
that 
power 
of 
attraction 
which 
everything 
contrary, 
everything 
antipodal 
possesses. 
The 
title 
of 
the 
little 
book 
was 
The 
Origin 
of 
the 
Moral 
Sensations; 
its 
author 
Dr. 
Paul 
Rée; 
the 
year 
in 
which 
it 
appeared 
1877. 
Perhaps 
I 
have 
never 
read 
anything 
to 
which 
I 
would 
have 
said 
to 
myself 
No, 
proposition 
by 
proposition, 
conclusion 
by 
conclusion, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
I 
did 
to 
this 
book: 
yet 
quite 
without 
ill-humor 
or 
impatience. 
In 
the 
above-mentioned 
work, 
on 
which 
I 
was 
then 
engaged, 
I 
made 
opportune 
and 
inopportune 
reference 
to 
the 
propositions 
of 
that 
book, 
not 
in 
order 
to 
refute 
them—what 
have 
I 
to 
do 
with 
refutations!—but, 
as 
becomes 
a 
positive 
spirit, 
to 
replace 
the 
improbable 
with 
the 
more 
probable, 
possibly 
one 
error 
with 
another. 
It 
was 
then, 
as 
I 
have 
said, 
that 
I 
advanced 
for 
the 
first 
time 
those 
genealogical 
hypotheses 
to 
which 
this 
treatise 
is 
devoted—ineptly, 
as 
I 
should 
be 
the 
last 
to 
deny, 
still 
constrained, 
still 
lacking 
my 
own 
language 
for 
my 
own 
things 
and 
with 
much 
backsliding 
and 
vacillation. 
One 
should 
compare 
in 
particular 
what 
I 
say 
in

section 
45, 
on 
the 
twofold 
prehistory 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
(namely, 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
noble 
and 
in 
that 
of 
the 
slaves); 
likewise, 
section 
136, 
on 
the 
value 
and 
origin 
of 
the 
morality 
of 
asceticism; 
likewise, 
sections 
96 
and 
99 
and 
volume 
II, 
section 
89, 
on 
the 
“morality 
of 
mores,” 
that 
much 
older 
and 
more 
primitive 
species 
of 
morality 
which 
differs 
toto 
caelo3 
from 
the 
altruistic 
mode 
of 
evaluation 
(in 
which 
Dr. 
Rée, 
like 
all 
English 
moral 
genealogists, 
sees 
moral 
evaluation 
as 
such); 
likewise, 
section 
92, 
The 
Wanderer, 
section 
26, 
and 
Dawn, 
section 
112, 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
justice 
as 
an 
agreement 
between 
two 
approximately 
equal 
powers 
(equality 
as 
the 
presupposition 
of 
all 
compacts, 
consequently 
of 
all 
law); 
likewise 
The 
Wanderer, 
sections 
22 
and 
33, 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
punishment, 
of 
which 
the 
aim 
of 
intimidation 
is 
neither 
the 
essence 
nor 
the 
source 
(as 
Dr. 
Rée 
thinks—it 
is 



rather 
only 
introduced, 
under 
certain 
definite 
circumstances, 
and 
always 
as 
an 
incidental, 
as 
something 
added).4 



5 


Even 
then 
my 
real 
concern 
was 
something 
much 
more 
important 
than 
hypothesis-mongering, 
whether 
my 
own 
or 
other 
people’s, 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
morality 
(or 
more 
precisely: 
the 
latter 
concerned 
me 
solely 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
a 
goal 
to 
which 
it 
was 
only 
one 
means 
among 
many). 
What 
was 
at 
stake 
was 
the 
value 
of 
morality—and 
over 
this 
I 
had 
to 
come 
to 
terms 
almost 
exclusively 
with 
my 
great 
teacher 
Schopenhauer, 
to 
whom 
that 
book 
of 
mine, 
the 
passion 
and 
the 
concealed 
contradiction 
of 
that 
book, 
addressed 
itself 
as 
if 
to 
a 
contemporary 
(—for 
that 
book, 
too, 
was 
a 
“polemic”). 
What 
was 
especially 
at 
stake 
was 
the 
value 
of 
the 
“unegoistic,” 
the 
instincts 
of 
pity, 
self-abnegation, 
self-sacrifice, 
which 
Schopenhauer 
had 
gilded, 
deified, 
and 
projected 
into 
a 
beyond 
for 
so 
long 
that 
at 
last 
they 
became 
for 
him 
“value-initself,” 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
which 
he 
said 
No 
to 
life 
and 
to 
himself. 
But 
it 
was 
against 
precisely 
these 
instincts 
that 
there 
spoke 
from 
me 
an 
ever 
more 
fundamental 
mistrust, 
an 
ever 
more 
corrosive 
skepticism! 
It 
was 
precisely 
here 
that 
I 
saw 
the 
great 
danger 
to 
mankind, 
its 
sublimest 
enticement 
and 
seduction—but 
to 
what? 
to 
nothingness?—it 
was 
precisely 
here 
that 
I 
saw 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
end, 
the 
dead 
stop, 
a 
retrospective 
weariness, 
the 
will 
turning 
against 
life, 
the 
tender 
and 
sorrowful 
signs 
of 
the 
ultimate 
illness: 
I 
understood 
the 
ever 
spreading 
morality 
of 
pity 
that 
had 
seized 
even 
on 
philosophers 
and 
made 
them 
ill, 
as 
the 
most 
sinister 
symptom 
of 
a 
European 
culture 
that 
had 
itself 
become 
sinister, 
perhaps 
as 
its 
by-pass 
to 
a 
new 
Buddhism? 
to 
a 
Buddhism 
for 
Europeans? 
to—nihilism? 


For 
this 
overestimation 
of 
and 
predilection 
for 
pity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
modern 
philosophers 
is 
something 
new: 
hitherto 
philosophers 
have 
been 
at 
one 
as 
to 
the 
worthlessness 
of 
pity. 
I 
name 
only 
Plato, 
Spinoza, 
La 
Rochefoucauld 
and 
Kant—four 
spirits 
as 
different 
from 
one 
another 
as 
possible, 
but 
united 
in 
one 
thing: 
in 
their 
low 
estimation 
of 
pity. 



6 


This 
problem 
of 
the 
value 
of 
pity 
and 
of 
the 
morality 
of 
pity 
(—I 
am 
opposed 
to 
the 
pernicious 
modern 
effeminacy 
of 
feeling—) 
seems 
at 
first 
to 
be 
merely 
something 
detached, 
an 
isolated 
question 
mark; 
but 
whoever 
sticks 
with 
it 
and 
learns 
how 
to 
ask 
questions 
here 
will 
experience 
what 
I 
experienced—a 
tremendous 
new 
prospect 
opens 
up 
for 
him, 
a 
new 
possibility 
comes 
over 
him 
like 
a 
vertigo, 
every 
kind 
of 
mistrust, 
suspicion, 
fear 
leaps 
up, 
his 
belief 
in 
morality, 
in 
all 
morality, 
falters—finally 
a 
new 
demand 
becomes 
audible. 
Let 
us 
articulate 
this 
new 
demand: 
we 
need 
a 
critique 
of 
moral 
values, 
the 
value 
of 
these 
values 
themselves 
must 
first 
be 
called 
in 
question—and 
for 
that 
there 
is 
needed 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
conditions 
and 
circumstances 
in 
which 
they 
grew, 
under 
which 
they 
evolved 
and 
changed 
(morality 
as 
consequence, 
as 
symptom, 
as 
mask, 
as 
tartufferie, 
as 
illness, 
as 
misunderstanding; 
but 
also 
morality 
as 
cause, 
as 
remedy, 
as 
stimulant, 
as 
restraint, 
as 
poison), 
a 
knowledge 
of 
a 
kind 
that 
has 
never 
yet 
existed 
or 
even 
been 
desired. 
One 
has 
taken 
the 
value 
of 
these 
“values” 
as 
given, 
as 
factual, 
as 
beyond 
all 
question; 
one 
has 
hitherto 
never 
doubted 
or 
hesitated 
in 
the 
slightest 
degree 
in 
supposing 
“the 
good 
man” 
to 
be 
of 
greater 
value 
than 
“the 
evil 
man,” 
of 
greater 
value 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
furthering 
the 
advancement 
and 
prosperity 
of 
man 
in 
general 
(the 
future 
of 
man 
included). 
But 
what 
if 
the 
reverse 
were 
true? 
What 
if 
a 
symptom 
of 
regression 
were 
inherent 
in 
the 
“good,” 
likewise 
a 
danger, 
a 
seduction, 
a 
poison, 
a 
narcotic, 
through 
which 
the 
present 
was 
possibly 
living 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
future? 
Perhaps 
more 
comfortably, 
less 
dangerously, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
in 
a 
meaner 
style, 
more 
basely?— 
So 
that 
precisely 
morality 
would 
be 
to 
blame 
if 
the 
highest 
power 
and 
splendor 
actually 
possible 
to 
the 
type 
man 
was 
never 
in 
fact 
attained? 
So 
that 
precisely 
morality 
was 
the 
danger 
of 
dangers? 



7 


Let 
it 
suffice 
that, 
after 
this 
prospect 
had 
opened 
up 
before 
me, 
I 
had 
reasons 
to 
look 
about 
me 
for 
scholarly, 
bold, 
and 
industrious 
comrades 
(I 
am 
still 
looking). 
The 
project 
is 
to 
traverse 
with 
quite 
novel 
questions, 
and 
as 
though 
with 
new 
eyes, 
the 
enormous, 
distant, 
and 
so 
well 
hidden 
land 
of 
morality—of 
morality 
that 
has 
actually 
existed, 
actually 
been 
lived; 
and 
does 
this 
not 
mean 
virtually 
to 
discover 
this 
land 
for 
the 
first 
time? 


If 
I 
considered 
in 
this 
connection 
the 
above-mentioned 
Dr. 
Rée, 
among 
others, 
it 
was 
because 
I 
had 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
his 
inquiries 
would 
compel 
him 
to 
adopt 
a 
better 
method 
for 
reaching 
answers. 
Have 
I 
deceived 
myself 
in 
this? 
My 
desire, 
at 
any 
rate, 
was 
to 
point 
out 
to 
so 
sharp 
and 
disinterested 
an 
eye 
as 
his 
a 
better 
direction 
in 
which 
to 
look, 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
an 
actual 
history 
of 
morality, 
and 
to 
warn 
him 
in 
time 
against 
gazing 
around 
haphazardly 
in 
the 
blue 
after 
the 
English 
fashion. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
obvious 
which 
color 
is 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
vital 
for 
a 
genealogist 
of 
morals 
than 
blue: 
namely 
gray, 
that 
is, 
what 
is 
documented, 
what 
can 
actually 
be 
confirmed 
and 
has 
actually 
existed, 
in 
short 
the 
entire 
long 
hieroglyphic 
record, 
so 
hard 
to 
decipher, 
of 
the 
moral 
past 
of 
mankind! 


This 
was 
unknown 
to 
Dr. 
Rée; 
but 
he 
had 
read 
Darwin—so 
that 
in 
his 
hypotheses, 
and 
after 
a 
fashion 
that 
is 
at 
least 
entertaining, 
the 
Darwinian 
beast 
and 
the 
ultramodern 
unassuming 
moral 
milksop 
who 
“no 
longer 
bites” 
politely 
link 
hands, 
the 
latter 
wearing 
an 
expression 
of 
a 
certain 
good-natured 
and 
refined 
indolence, 
with 
which 
is 
mingled 
even 
a 
grain 
of 
pessimism 
and 
weariness, 
as 
if 
all 
these 
things—the 
problems 
of 
morality—were 
really 
not 
worth 
taking 
quite 
so 
seriously. 
But 
to 
me, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
nothing 
more 
worth 
taking 
seriously, 
among 
the 
rewards 
for 
it 
being 
that 
some 
day 
one 
will 
perhaps 
be 
allowed 
to 
take 
them 
cheerfully. 
For 
cheerfulness—or 
in 
my 
own 
language 
gay 
science—is 
a 
reward: 
the 
reward 
of 
a 
long, 
brave, 
industrious, 
and 
subterranean 
seriousness, 
of 
which, 
to 
be 
sure, 
not 
everyone 
is 
capable. 
But 
on 
the 
day 
we 
can 
say 
with 
all 
our 
hearts, 
“Onwards! 
our 
old 
morality 
too 
is 
part 
of 
the 
comedy!” 
we 
shall 
have 
discovered 
a 
new 
complication 
and 
possibility 
for 
the 
Dionysian 
drama 
of 
“The 
Destiny 
of 
the 
Soul”—and 
one 
can 
wager 
that 
the 
grand 
old 
eternal 



comic 
poet 
of 
our 
existence 
will 
be 
quick 
to 
make 
use 
of 
it!

If 
this 
book 
is 
incomprehensible 
to 
anyone 
and 
jars 
on 
his 
ears, 
the 
fault, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
is 
not 
necessarily 
mine. 
It 
is 
clear 
enough, 
assuming, 
as 
I 
do 
assume, 
that 
one 
has 
first 
read 
my 
earlier 
writings 
and 
has 
not 
spared 
some 
trouble 
in 
doing 
so: 
for 
they 
are, 
indeed, 
not 
easy 
to 
penetrate.5 


Regarding 
my 
Zarathustra, 
for 
example, 
I 
do 
not 
allow 
that 
anyone 
knows 
that 
book 
who 
has 
not 
at 
some 
time 
been 
profoundly 
wounded 
and 
at 
some 
time 
profoundly 
delighted 
by 
every 
word 
in 
it; 
for 
only 
then 
may 
he 
enjoy 
the 
privilege 
of 
reverentially 
sharing 
in 
the 
halcyon 
element 
out 
of 
which 
that 
book 
was 
born 
and 
in 
its 
sunlight 
clarity, 
remoteness, 
breadth, 
and 
certainty. 
In 
other 
cases, 
people 
find 
difficulty 
with 
the 
aphoristic 
form: 
this 
arises 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
today 
this 
form 
is 
not 
taken 
seriously 
enough. 
An 
aphorism, 
properly 
stamped 
and 
molded, 
has 
not 
been 
“deciphered” 
when 
it 
has 
simply 
been 
read; 
rather, 
one 
has 
then 
to 
begin 
its 
exegesis, 
for 
which 
is 
required 
an 
art 
of 
exegesis. 
I 
have 
offered 
in 
the 
third 
essay 
of 
the 
present 
book 
an 
example 
of 
what 
I 
regard 
as 
“exegesis” 
in 
such 
a 
case—an 
aphorism 
is 
prefixed 
to 
this 
essay, 
the 
essay 
itself 
is 
a 
commentary 
on 
it. 
To 
be 
sure, 
one 
thing 
is 
necessary 
above 
all 
if 
one 
is 
to 
practice 
reading 
as 
an 
art 
in 
this 
way, 
something 
that 
has 
been 
unlearned 
most 
thoroughly 
nowadays—and 
therefore 
it 
will 
be 
some 
time 
before 
my 
writings 
are 
“readable”—something 
for 
which 
one 
has 
almost 
to 
be 
a 
cow 
and 
in 
any 
case 
not 
a 
“modern 
man”: 
rumination.

See

Nietzsche’s 
Preface 
to 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
The 
Dawn, 
written 
in 
the 
fall 
of 
1886: 
“… 
to 
read 
well, 
that 
means 
reading 
slowly, 
deeply, 
with 
consideration 
and 
caution 
…” 
The 
last 
four 
words 
do 
not 
adequately 
render 
rück-und 
vorsichtig, 
which 
can 
also 
mean, 
looking 
backward 
and 
forward—i.e., 
with 
a 
regard 
for 
the 
context, 
including 
also 
the 
writer’s 
earlier 
and 
later 
works. 
Cf. 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
my 
note 
on 
section 
250. 


Yet 
Arthur 
Danto 
voices 
a 
very 
common 
assumption 
when 
he 
says 
on 
the 
first 
page 
of 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
his 
Nietzsche 
as 
Philosopher 
(New 
York, 
Macmillan, 
1965): 
“No 
one 
of 
them 
[i.e., 
Nietzsche’s 
books] 
presupposes 
an 
acquaintance 
with 
any 
other 
… 
his 
writings 
may 
be 
read 
in 
pretty 
much 
any 
order, 
without 
this 
greatly 
impeding 
the 
comprehension 
of 
his 
ideas.” 
This 
is 
as 
wrong 
as 
Danto’s 
claim 
on 
the 
same 
page 
that 
“it 
would 
be 
difficult 
even 
for 
a 
close 
reader 
to 
tell 
the 
difference 
between 
those 
works 
he 
[Nietzsche] 
saw 
through 
the 
press 
[e.g., 
the 
Genealogy] 
and 
those 
[sic] 
pieced 
together 
by 
his 
editors 
[i.e., 
The 
Will 
to 
Power].” 
Indeed, 
Danto, 
like 
most 
readers, 
approaches 
Nietzsche 
as 
if 
“any 
given 
aphorism 
or 
essay 
might 
as 
easily 
have 
been 
placed 
in 
one 
volume 
as 
in 
another”; 
he 
bases 
his 
discussions 
on 
short 
snippets, 
torn 
from 
their 
context, 
and 
frequently 
omits 
phrases 
without 
indicating 
that 
he 
has 
done 
so; 
and 
he 
does 
not 
bother 
to 
consider 
all 
or 
most 
of 
the 
passages 
that 
are 
relevant 
to 
the 
topics 
he 
discusses. 


This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
few 
books 
in 
English 
that 
deal 
with 
Nietzsche 
as 
a 
philosopher, 
and 
Danto’s 
standing 
as 
a 
philosopher 
inspires 
confidence; 
but 
his 
account 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
moral 
and 
epistemological 
ideas 
unfortunately 
depends 
on 
this 
untenable 
approach.

These 
English 
psychologists, 
whom 
one 
has 
also 
to 
thank 
for 
the 
only 
attempts 
hitherto 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
history 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
morality—they 
themselves 
are 
no 
easy 
riddle; 
I 
confess 
that, 
as 
living 
riddles, 
they 
even 
possess 
one 
essential 
advantage 
over 
their 
books—they 
are 
interesting! 
These 
English 
psychologists—what 
do 
they 
really 
want? 
One 
always 
discovers 
them 
voluntarily 
or 
involuntarily 
at 
the 
same 
task, 
namely 
at 
dragging 
the 
partie 
honteuse1 
of 
our 
inner 
world 
into 
the 
foreground 
and 
seeking 
the 
truly 
effective 
and 
directing 
agent, 
that 
which 
has 
been 
decisive 
in 
its 
evolution, 
in 
just 
that 
place 
where 
the 
intellectual 
pride 
of 
man 
would 
least 
desire 
to 
find 
it 
(in 
the 
vis 
inertiae2 
of 
habit, 
for 
example, 
or 
in 
forgetfulness, 
or 
in 
a 
blind 
and 
chance 
mechanistic 
hooking-together 
of 
ideas, 
or 
in 
something 
purely 
passive, 
automatic, 
reflexive, 
molecular, 
and 
thoroughly 
stupid)—what 
is 
it 
really 
that 
always 
drives 
these 
psychologists 
in 
just 
this 
direction? 
Is 
it 
a 
secret, 
malicious, 
vulgar, 
perhaps 
self-deceiving 
instinct 
for 
belittling 
man? 
Or 
possibly 
a 
pessimistic 
suspicion, 
the 
mistrustfulness 
of 
disappointed 
idealists 
grown 
spiteful 
and 
gloomy? 
Or 
a 
petty 
subterranean 
hostility 
and 
rancor 
toward 
Christianity 
(and 
Plato) 
that 
has 
perhaps 
not 
even 
crossed 
the 
threshold 
of 
consciousness? 
Or 
even 
a 
lascivious 
taste 
for 
the 
grotesque, 
the 
painfully 
paradoxical, 
the 
questionable 
and 
absurd 
in 
existence? 
Or 
finally— 
something 
of 
each 
of 
them, 
a 
little 
vulgarity, 
a 
little 
gloominess, 
a 
little 
anti-
Christianity, 
a 
little 
itching 
and 
need 
for 
spice? 


But 
I 
am 
told 
they 
are 
simply 
old, 
cold, 
and 
tedious 
frogs, 
creeping 
around 
men 
and 
into 
men 
as 
if 
in 
their 
own 
proper 
element, 
that 
is, 
in 
a 
swamp.I 
rebel 
at 
that 
idea; 
more, 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
it; 
and 
if 
one 
may 
be 
allowed 
to 
hope 
where 
one 
does 
not 
know, 
then 
I 
hope 
from 
my 
heart 
they 
may 
be 
the 
reverse 
of 
this—that 
these 
investigators 
and 
microscopists 
of 
the 
soul 
may 
be 
fundamentally 
brave, 
proud, 
and 
magnanimous 
animals, 
who 
know 
how 
to 
keep 
their 
hearts 
as 
well 
as 
their 
sufferings 
in 
bounds 
and 
have 
trained 
themselves 
to 
sacrifice 
all 
desirability 
to 
truth, 
every 
truth, 
even 
plain, 
harsh, 
ugly, 
repellent, 
unchristian, 
immoral 
truth.—For 
such 
truths 
do 
exist.—

All 
respect 
then 
for 
the 
good 
spirits 
that 
may 
rule 
in 
these 
historians 
of 
morality! 
But 
it 
is, 
unhappily, 
certain 
that 
the 
historical 
spirit 
itself 
is 
lacking 
in 
them, 
that 
precisely 
all 
the 
good 
spirits 
of 
history 
itself 
have 
left 
them 
in 
the 
lurch! 
As 
is 
the 
hallowed 
custom 
with 
philosophers, 
the 
thinking 
of 
all 
of 
them 
is 
by 
nature 
unhistorical; 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
about 
that. 
The 
way 
they 
have 
bungled 
their 
moral 
genealogy 
comes 
to 
light 
at 
the 
very 
beginning, 
where 
the 
task 
is 
to 
investigate 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
concept 
and 
judgment 
“good.” 
“Originally”—so 
they 
decree—”one 
approved 
unegoistic 
actions 
and 
called 
them 
good 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
they 
were 
done, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
those 
to 
whom 
they 
were 
useful; 
later 
one 
forgot 
how 
this 
approval 
originated 
and, 
simply 
because 
unegoistic 
actions 
were 
always 
habitually 
praised 
as 
good, 
one 
also 
felt 
them 
to 
be 
good—as 
if 
they 
were 
something 
good 
in 
themselves.” 
One 
sees 
straightaway 
that 
this 
primary 
derivation 
already 
contains 
all 
the 
typical 
traits 
of 
the 
idiosyncrasy 
of 
the 
English 
psychologists—we 
have 
“utility,” 
“forgetting,” 
“habit,” 
and 
finally 
“error,” 
all 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
evaluation 
of 
which 
the 
higher 
man 
has 
hitherto 
been 
proud 
as 
though 
it 
were 
a 
kind 
of 
prerogative 
of 
man 
as 
such. 
This 
pride 
has 
to 
be 
humbled, 
this 
evaluation 
disvalued: 
has 
that 
end 
been 
achieved? 


Now 
it 
is 
plain 
to 
me, 
first 
of 
all, 
that 
in 
this 
theory 
the 
source 
of 
the 
concept 
“good” 
has 
been 
sought 
and 
established 
in 
the 
wrong 
place: 
the 
judgment 
“good” 
did 
not 
originate 
with 
those 
to 
whom 
“goodness” 
was 
shown! 
Rather 
it 
was 
“the 
good” 
themselves, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
noble, 
powerful, 
high-stationed 
and 
high-minded, 
who 
felt 
and 
established 
themselves 
and 
their 
actions 
as 
good, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
first 
rank, 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
all 
the 
low, 
low-minded, 
common 
and 
plebeian. 
It 
was 
out 
of 
this 
pathos 
of 
distance1 
that 
they 
first 
seized 
the 
right 
to 
create 
values 
and 
to 
coin 
names 
for 
values: 
what 
had 
they 
to 
do 
with 
utility! 
The 
viewpoint 
of 
utility 
is 
as 
remote 
and 
inappropriate 
as 
it 
possibly 
could 
be 
in 
face 
of 
such 
a 
burning 
eruption 
of 
the 
highest 
rank-ordering, 
rank-defining 
value 
judgments: 
for 
here 
feeling 
has 
attained 
the 
antithesis 
of 
that 
low 
degree 
of 
warmth 
which 
any 
calculating 
prudence, 
any 
calculus 
of 
utility, 
presupposes 



—and 
not 
for 
once 
only, 
not 
for 
an 
exceptional 
hour, 
but 
for 
good. 
The 
pathos 
of 
nobility 
and 
distance, 
as 
aforesaid, 
the 
protracted 
and 
domineering 
fundamental 
total 
feeling 
on 
the 
part 
of 
a 
higher 
ruling 
order 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
lower 
order, 
to 
a 
“below”—that 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
antithesis 
“good” 
and 
“bad.” 
(The 
lordly 
right 
of 
giving 
names 
extends 
so 
far 
that 
one 
should 
allow 
oneself 
to 
conceive 
the 
origin 
of 
language 
itself 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
power 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
rulers: 
they 
say 
“this 
is 
this 
and 
this,” 
they 
seal 
every 
thing 
and 
event 
with 
a 
sound 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
take 
possession 
of 
it.) 
It 
follows 
from 
this 
origin 
that 
the 
word 
“good” 
was 
definitely 
not 
linked 
from 
the 
first 
and 
by 
necessity 
to 
“unegoistic” 
actions, 
as 
the 
superstition 
of 
these 
genealogists 
of 
morality 
would 
have 
it. 
Rather 
it 
was 
only 
when 
aristocratic 
value 
judgments 
declined 
that 
the 
whole 
antithesis 
“egoistic” 
“unegoistic” 
obtruded 
itself 
more 
and 
more 
on 
the 
human 
conscience—it 
is, 
to 
speak 
in 
my 
own 
language, 
the 
herd 
instinct 
that 
through 
this 
antithesis 
at 
last 
gets 
its 
word 
(and 
its 
words) 
in. 
And 
even 
then 
it 
was 
a 
long 
time 
before 
that 
instinct 
attained 
such 
dominion 
that 
moral 
evaluation 
was 
actually 
stuck 
and 
halted 
at 
this 
antithesis 
(as, 
for 
example, 
is 
the 
case 
in 
contemporary 
Europe: 
the 
prejudice 
that 
takes 
“moral,” 
“unegoistic,” 
désintéressé” 
as 
concepts 
of 
equivalent 
value 
already 
rules 
today 
with 
the 
force 
of 
a 
“fixed 
idea” 
and 
brain-sickness). 



3 


In 
the 
second 
place, 
however: 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
historical 
untenability 
of 
this 
hypothesis 
regarding 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
value 
judgment 
“good,” 
it 
suffers 
from 
an 
inherent 
psychological 
absurdity. 
The 
utility 
of 
the 
unegoistic 
action 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
the 
source 
of 
the 
approval 
accorded 
it, 
and 
this 
source 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
been 
forgotten—but 
how 
is 
this 
forgetting 
possible? 
Has 
the 
utility 
of 
such 
actions 
come 
to 
an 
end 
at 
some 
time 
or 
other? 
The 
opposite 
is 
the 
case: 
this 
utility 
has 
rather 
been 
an 
everyday 
experience 
at 
all 
times, 
therefore 
something 
that 
has 
been 
underlined 
again 
and 
again: 
consequently, 
instead 
of 
fading 
from 
consciousness, 
instead 
of 
becoming 
easily 
forgotten, 
it 
must 
have 
been 
impressed 
on 
the 
consciousness 
more 
and 
more 
clearly. 
How 
much 
more 
reasonable 
is 
that 
opposing 
theory 
(it 
is 
not 
for 
that 
reason 
more 
true—) 
which 
Herbert 
Spencer,1 
for 
example, 
espoused: 
that 
the 
concept 
“good” 
is 
essentially 
identical 
with 
the 
concept 
“useful,” 
“practical,” 
so 
that 
in 
the 
judgments 
“good” 
and 
“bad” 
mankind 
has 
summed 
up 
and 
sanctioned 
precisely 
its 
unforgotten 
and 
unforgettable 
experiences 
regarding 
what 
is 
useful-practical 
and 
what 
is 
harmful-impractical. 
According 
to 
this 
theory, 
that 
which 
has 
always 
proved 
itself 
useful 
is 
good: 
therefore 
it 
may 
claim 
to 
be 
“valuable 
in 
the 
highest 
degree,” 
“valuable 
in 
itself.” 
This 
road 
to 
an 
explanation 
is, 
as 
aforesaid, 
also 
a 
wrong 
one, 
but 
at 
least 
the 
explanation 
is 
in 
itself 
reasonable 
and 
psychologically 
tenable. 



4 


The 
signpost 
to 
the 
right 
road 
was 
for 
me 
the 
question: 
what 
was 
the 
real 
etymological 
significance 
of 
the 
designations 
for 
“good” 
coined 
in 
the 
various 
languages? 
I 
found 
they 
all 
led 
back 
to 
the 
same 
conceptual 
transformation—that 
everywhere 
“noble,” 
“aristocratic” 
in 
the 
social 
sense, 
is 
the 
basic 
concept 
from 
which 
“good” 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
“with 
aristocratic 
soul,” 
“noble,” 
“with 
a 
soul 
of 
a 
high 
order,” 
“with 
a 
privileged 
soul” 
necessarily 
developed: 
a 
development 
which 
always 
runs 
parallel 
with 
that 
other 
in 
which 
“common,” 
“plebeian,” 
“low” 
are 
finally 
transformed 
into 
the 
concept 
“bad.” 
The 
most 
convincing 
example 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
the 
German 
word 
schlecht 
[bad] 
itself: 
which 
is 
identical 
with 
schlicht 
[plain, 
simple]— 
compare 
schlechtweg 
[plainly], 
schlechterdings 
[simply]—and 
orginally 
designated 
the 
plain, 
the 
common 
man, 
as 
yet 
with 
no 
inculpatory 
implication 
and 
simply 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
nobility. 
About 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Thirty 
Years’ 
War, 
late 
enough 
therefore, 
this 
meaning 
changed 
into 
the 
one 
now 
customary.1 


With 
regard 
to 
a 
moral 
genealogy 
this 
seems 
to 
me 
a 
fundamental 
insight; 
that 
it 
has 
been 
arrived 
at 
so 
late 
is 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
retarding 
influence 
exercised 
by 
the 
democratic 
prejudice 
in 
the 
modern 
world 
toward 
all 
questions 
of 
origin. 
And 
this 
is 
so 
even 
in 
the 
apparently 
quite 
objective 
domain 
of 
natural 
science 
and 
physiology, 
as 
I 
shall 
merely 
hint 
here. 
But 
what 
mischief 
this 
prejudice 
is 
capable 
of 
doing, 
especially 
to 
morality 
and 
history, 
once 
it 
has 
been 
unbridled 
to 
the 
point 
of 
hatred 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
notorious 
case 
of 
Buckle;2 
here 
the 
plebeianism 
of 
the 
modern 
spirit, 
which 
is 
of 
English 
origin, 
erupted 
once 
again 
on 
its 
native 
soil, 
as 
violently 
as 
a 
mud 
volcano 
and 
with 
that 
salty, 
noisy, 
vulgar 
eloquence 
with 
which 
all 
volcanos 
have 
spoken 
hitherto.— 



5 


With 
regard 
to 
our 
problem, 
which 
may 
on 
good 
grounds 
be 
called 
a 
quiet 
problem 
and 
one 
which 
fastidiously 
directs 
itself 
to 
few 
ears, 
it 
is 
of 
no 
small 
interest 
to 
ascertain 
that 
through 
those 
words 
and 
roots 
which 
designate 
“good” 
there 
frequently 
still 
shines 
the 
most 
important 
nuance 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
the 
noble 
felt 
themselves 
to 
be 
men 
of 
a 
higher 
rank. 
Granted 
that, 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
they 
designate 
themselves 
simply 
by 
their 
superiority 
in 
power 
(as 
“the 
powerful,” 
“the 
masters,” 
“the 
commanders”) 
or 
by 
the 
most 
clearly 
visible 
signs 
of 
this 
superiority, 
for 
example, 
as 
“the 
rich,” 
“the 
possessors” 
(this 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
arya; 
and 
of 
corresponding 
words 
in 
Iranian 
and 
Slavic). 
But 
they 
also 
do 
it 
by 
a 
typical 
character 
trait: 
and 
this 
is 
the 
case 
that 
concerns 
us 
here. 
They 
call 
themselves, 
for 
instance, 
“the 
truthful”; 
this 
is 
so 
above 
all 
of 
the 
Greek 
nobility, 
whose 
mouthpiece 
is 
the 
Megarian 
poet 
Theognis.1 


The 
root 
of 
the 
word 
coined 
for 
this, 
esthlos,2 
signifies 
one 
who 
is, 
who 
possesses 
reality, 
who 
is 
actual, 
who 
is 
true; 
then, 
with 
a 
subjective 
turn, 
the 
true 
as 
the 
truthful: 
in 
this 
phase 
of 
conceptual 
transformation 
it 
becomes 
a 
slogan 
and 
catchword 
of 
the 
nobility 
and 
passes 
over 
entirely 
into 
the 
sense 
of 
“noble,” 
as 
distinct 
from 
the 
lying 
common 
man, 
which 
is 
what 
Theognis 
takes 
him 
to 
be 
and 
how 
he 
describes 
him—until 
finally, 
after 
the 
decline 
of 
the 
nobility, 
the 
word 
is 
left 
to 
designate 
nobility 
of 
soul 
and 
becomes 
as 
it 


3

were 
ripe 
and 
sweet. 
In 
the 
word 
kakos, 
as 
in 
deilos4 
(the 
plebeian 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
agathos5), 
cowardice 
is 
emphasized: 
this 
perhaps 
gives 
an 
indication 
in 
which 
direction 
one 
should 
seek 
the 
etymological 
origin 
of 
agathos, 
which 
is 
susceptible 
of 
several 
interpretations. 
The 
Latin 
malus6 
(beside 
which 
I 
set 
melas7) 
may 
designate 
the 
common 
man 
as 
the 
dark-colored, 
above 
all 
as 
the 
black-haired 
man 
(“hie 
niger 
est8 
—”), 
as 
the 
pre-Aryan 
occupant 
of 
the 
soil 
of 
Italy 
who 
was 
distinguished 
most 
obviously 
from 
the 
blond, 
that 
is 
Aryan, 
conqueror 
race 
by 
his 
color; 
Gaelic, 
at 
any 
rate, 
offers 
us 
a 
precisely 
similar 
case—fin 
(for 
example 
in 
the 
name 
Fin-Gal), 
the 
distinguishing 
word 
for 
nobility, 
finally 
for 
the 
good, 
noble, 
pure, 
orginally 
meant 
the 
blond-headed, 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
dark, 
black-haired 



aboriginal 
inhabitants. 


The 
Celts, 
by 
the 
way, 
were 
definitely 
a 
blond 
race; 
it 
is 
wrong 
to 
associate 
traces 
of 
an 
essentially 
dark-haired 
people 
which 
appear 
on 
the 
more 
careful 
ethnographical 
maps 
of 
Germany 
with 
any 
sort 
of 
Celtic 
origin 
or 
blood-
mixture, 
as 
Virchow9 
still 
does: 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
pre-Aryan 
people 
of 
Germany 
who 
emerge 
in 
these 
places. 
(The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
virtually 
all 
Europe: 
the 
suppressed 
race 
has 
gradually 
recovered 
the 
upper 
hand 
again, 
in 
coloring, 
shortness 
of 
skull, 
perhaps 
even 
in 
the 
intellectual 
and 
social 
instincts: 
who 
can 
say 
whether 
modern 
democracy, 
even 
more 
modern 
anarchism 
and 
especially 
that 
inclination 
for 
“commune” 
for 
the 
most 
primitive 
form 
of 
society, 
which 
is 
now 
shared 
by 
all 
the 
socialists 
of 
Europe, 
does 
not 
signify 
in 
the 
main 
a 
tremendous 
counterattack—and 
that 
the 
conqueror 
and 
master 
race,10 
the 
Aryan, 
is 
not 
succumbing 
physiologically, 
too? 


I 
believe 
I 
may 
venture 
to 
interpret 
the 
Latin 
bonus11 
as 
“the 
warrior,” 
provided 
I 
am 
right 
in 
tracing 
bonus 
back 
to 
an 
earlier 
duonus12 


(compare 
bellum 
= 
duellum 
= 
duen-lum, 
which 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
contain 
duonus). 
Therefore 
bonus 
as 
the 
man 
of 
strife, 
of 
dissention 
(duo), 
as 
the 
man 
of 
war: 
one 
sees 
what 
constituted 
the 
“goodness” 
of 
a 
man 
in 
ancient 
Rome. 
Our 
German 
gut 
[good] 
even: 
does 
it 
not 
signify 
“the 
godlike,” 
the 
man 
of 
“godlike 
race”? 
And 
is 
it 
not 
identical 
with 
the 
popular 
(originally 
noble) 
name 
of 
the 
Goths? 
The 
grounds 
for 
this 
conjecture 
cannot 
be 
dealt 
with 
here. 
— 



6 


To 
this 
rule 
that 
a 
concept 
denoting 
political 
superiority 
always 
resolves 
itself 
into 
a 
concept 
denoting 
superiority 
of 
soul 
it 
is 
not 
necessarily 
an 
exception 
(although 
it 
provides 
occasions 
for 
exceptions) 
when 
the 
highest 
caste 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
priestly 
caste 
and 
therefore 
emphasizes 
in 
its 
total 
description 
of 
itself 
a 
predicate 
that 
calls 
to 
mind 
its 
priestly 
function. 
It 
is 
then, 
for 
example, 
that 
“pure” 
and 
“impure” 
confront 
one 
another 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
designations 
of 
station; 
and 
here 
too 
there 
evolves 
a 
“good” 
and 
a 
“bad” 
in 
a 
sense 
no 
longer 
referring 
to 
station. 
One 
should 
be 
warned, 
moreover, 
against 
taking 
these 
concepts 
“pure” 
and 
“impure” 
too 
ponderously 
or 
broadly, 
not 
to 
say 
symbolically: 
all 
the 
concepts 
of 
ancient 
man 
were 
rather 
at 
first 
incredibly 
uncouth, 
coarse, 
external, 
narrow, 
straightforward, 
and 
altogether 
unsymbolical 
in 
meaning 
to 
a 
degree 
that 
we 
can 
scarcely 
conceive. 
The 
“pure 
one” 
is 
from 
the 
beginning 
merely 
a 
man 
who 
washes 
himself, 
who 
forbids 
himself 
certain 
foods 
that 
produce 
skin 
ailments, 
who 
does 
not 
sleep 
with 
the 
dirty 
women 
of 
the 
lower 
strata, 
who 
has 
an 
aversion 
to 
blood—no 
more, 
hardly 
more! 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
to 
be 
sure, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
whole 
nature 
of 
an 
essentially 
priestly 
aristocracy 
why 
antithetical 
valuations 
could 
in 
precisely 
this 
instance 
soon 
become 
dangerously 
deepened, 
sharpened, 
and 
internalized; 
and 
indeed 
they 
finally 
tore 
chasms 
between 
man 
and 
man 
that 
a 
very 
Achilles 
of 
a 
free 
spirit 
would 
not 
venture 
to 
leap 
without 
a 
shudder. 
There 
is 
from 
the 
first 
something 
unhealthy 
in 
such 
priestly 
aristocracies 
and 
in 
the 
habits 
ruling 
in 
them 
which 
turn 
them 
away 
from 
action 
and 
alternate 
between 
brooding 
and 
emotional 
explosions, 
habits 
which 
seem 
to 
have 
as 
their 
almost 
invariable 
consequence 
that 
intestinal 
morbidity 
and 
neurasthenia 
which 
has 
afflicted 
priests 
at 
all 
times; 
but 
as 
to 
that 
which 
they 
themselves 
devised 
as 
a 
remedy 
for 
this 
morbidity—must 
one 
not 
assert 
that 
it 
has 
ultimately 
proved 
itself 
a 
hundred 
times 
more 
dangerous 
in 
its 
effects 
than 
the 
sickness 
it 
was 
supposed 
to 
cure? 
Mankind 
itself 
is 
still 
ill 
with 
the 
effects 
of 
this 
priestly 
naïveté 
in 
medicine! 
Think, 
for 
example, 
of 
certain 
forms 
of 
diet 
(abstinence 
from 
meat), 
of 
fasting, 
of 
sexual 
continence, 
of 
flight 
“into 
the 
wilderness” 
(the 
Weir 



Mitchell 
isolation 
cure1 


—without, 
to 
be 
sure, 
the 
subsequent 
fattening 
and 
overfeeding 
which 
constitute 
the 
most 
effective 
remedy 
for 
the 
hysteria 
induced 
by 
the 
ascetic 
ideal): 
add 
to 
these 
the 
entire 
antisensualistic 
metaphysic 
of 
the 
priests 
that 
makes 
men 
indolent 
and 
overre-fined, 
their 
autohypnosis 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
fakirs 
and 
Brahmins—Brahma 
used 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
glass 
knob 
and 
a 
fixed 
idea—and 
finally 
the 
only-too-comprehensible 
satiety 
with 
all 
this, 
together 
with 
the 
radical 
cure 
for 
it, 
nothingness 
(or 
God—the 
desire 
for 
a 
unio 
mystica 
with 
God 
is 
the 
desire 
of 
the 
Buddhist 
for 
nothingness, 
Nirvana—and 
no 
more!). 
For 
with 
the 
priests 
everything 
becomes 
more 
dangerous, 
not 
only 
cures 
and 
remedies, 
but 
also 
arrogance, 
revenge, 
acuteness, 
profligacy, 
love, 
lust 
to 
rule, 
virtue, 
disease—but 
it 
is 
only 
fair 
to 
add 
that 
it 
was 
on 
the 
soil 
of 
this 
essentially 
dangerous 
form 
of 
human 
existence, 
the 
priestly 
form, 
that 
man 
first 
became 
an 
interesting 
animal, 
that 
only 
here 
did 
the 
human 
soul 
in 
a 
higher 
sense 
acquire 
depth 
and 
become 
evil—and 
these 
are 
the 
two 
basic 
respects 
in 
which 
man 
has 
hitherto 
been 
superior 
to 
other 
beasts! 



7 


One 
will 
have 
divined 
already 
how 
easily 
the 
priestly 
mode 
of 
valuation 
can 
branch 
off 
from 
the 
knightly-aristocratic 
and 
then 
develop 
into 
its 
opposite; 
this 
is 
particularly 
likely 
when 
the 
priestly 
caste 
and 
the 
warrior 
caste 
are 
in 
jealous 
opposition 
to 
one 
another 
and 
are 
unwilling 
to 
come 
to 
terms. 
The 
knightly-aristocratic 
value 
judgments 
presupposed 
a 
powerful 
physicality, 
a 
flourishing, 
abundant, 
even 
overflowing 
health, 
together 
with 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
preserve 
it: 
war, 
adventure, 
hunting, 
dancing, 
war 
games, 
and 
in 
general 
all 
that 
involves 
vigorous, 
free, 
joyful 
activity. 
The 
priestly-
noble 
mode 
of 
valuation 
presupposes, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
other 
things: 
it 
is 
disadvantageous 
for 
it 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
war! 
As 
is 
well 
known, 
the 
priests 
are 
the 
most 
evil 
enemies—but 
why? 
Because 
they 
are 
the 
most 
impotent. 
It 
is 
because 
of 
their 
impotence 
that 
in 
them 
hatred 
grows 
to 
monstrous 
and 
uncanny 
proportions, 
to 
the 
most 
spiritual 
and 
poisonous 
kind 
of 
hatred. 
The 
truly 
great 
haters 
in 
world 
history 
have 
always 
been 
priests; 
likewise 
the 
most 
ingenious1 
haters: 
other 
kinds 
of 
spirit2 
hardly 
come 
into 
consideration 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
priestly 
vengefulness. 
Human 
history 
would 
be 
altogether 
too 
stupid 
a 
thing 
without 
the 
spirit 
that 
the 
impotent 
have 
introduced 
into 
it—let 
us 
take 
at 
once 
the 
most 
notable 
example. 
All 
that 
has 
been 
done 
on 
earth 
against 
“the 
noble,” 
“the 
powerful,” 
“the 
masters,” 
“the 
rulers,” 
fades 
into 
nothing 
compared 
with 
what 
the 
Jews 
have 
done 
against 
them; 
the 
Jews, 
that 
priestly 
people, 
who 
in 
opposing 
their 
enemies 
and 
conquerors 
were 
ultimately 
satisfied 
with 
nothing 
less 
than 
a 
radical 
revaluation 
of 
their 
enemies’ 
values, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
an 
act 
of 
the 
most 
spiritual 
revenge. 
For 
this 
alone 
was 
appropriate 
to 
a 
priestly 
people, 
the 
people 
embodying 
the 
most 
deeply 
repressed3 
priestly 
vengefulness. 
It 
was 
the 
Jews 
who, 
with 
awe-inspiring 
consistency, 
dared 
to 
invert 
the 
aristocratic 
value-
equation 
(good 
= 
noble 
= 
powerful 
= 
beautiful 
= 
happy 
= 
beloved 
of 
God) 
and 
to 
hang 
on 
to 
this 
inversion 
with 
their 
teeth, 
the 
teeth 
of 
the 
most 
abysmal 
hatred 
(the 
hatred 
of 
impotence), 
saying 
“the 
wretched 
alone 
are 
the 
good; 
the 
poor, 
impotent, 
lowly 
alone 
are 
the 
good; 
the 
suffering, 
deprived, 
sick, 
ugly 
alone 
are 
pious, 
alone 
are 
blessed 
by 
God, 
blessedness 
is 
for 
them 
alone— 



and 
you, 
the 
powerful 
and 
noble, 
are 
on 
the 
contrary 
the 
evil, 
the 
cruel, 
the 
lustful, 
the 
insatiable, 
the 
godless 
to 
all 
eternity; 
and 
you 
shall 
be 
in 
all 
eternity 
the 
unblessed, 
accursed, 
and 
damned!” 
… 
One 
knows 
who 
inherited 
this 
Jewish 
revaluation 
… 
In 
connection 
with 
the 
tremendous 
and 
immeasurably 
fateful 
initiative 
provided 
by 
the 
Jews 
through 
this 
most 
fundamental 
of 
all 
declarations 
of 
war, 
I 
recall 
the 
proposition 
I 
arrived 
at 
on 
a 
previous 
occasion 
(Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
195)4 


—that 
with 
the 
Jews 
there 
begins 
the 
slave 
revolt 
in 
morality: 
that 
revolt 
which 
has 
a 
history 
of 
two 
thousand 
years 
behind 
it 
and 
which 
we 
no 
longer 
see 
because 
it—has 
been 
victorious. 



8 


But 
you 
do 
not 
comprehend 
this? 
You 
are 
incapable 
of 
seeing 
something 
that 
required 
two 
thousand 
years 
to 
achieve 
victory?— 
There 
is 
nothing 
to 
wonder 
at 
in 
that: 
all 
protracted 
things 
are 
hard 
to 
see, 
to 
see 
whole. 
That, 
however, 
is 
what 
has 
happened: 
from 
the 
trunk 
of 
that 
tree 
of 
vengefulness 
and 
hatred, 
Jewish 
hatred—the 
profoundest 
and 
sublimest 
kind 
of 
hatred, 
capable 
of 
creating 
ideals 
and 
reversing 
values, 
the 
like 
of 
which 
has 
never 
existed 
on 
earth 
before—there 
grew 
something 
equally 
incomparable, 
a 
new 
love, 
the 
profoundest 
and 
sublimest 
kind 
of 
love—and 
from 
what 
other 
trunk 
could 
it 
have 
grown? 


One 
should 
not 
imagine 
it 
grew 
up 
as 
the 
denial 
of 
that 
thirst 
for 
revenge, 
as 
the 
opposite 
of 
Jewish 
hatred! 
No, 
the 
reverse 
is 
true! 
That 
love 
grew 
out 
of 
it 
as 
its 
crown, 
as 
its 
triumphant 
crown 
spreading 
itself 
farther 
and 
farther 
into 
the 
purest 
brightness 
and 
sunlight, 
driven 
as 
it 
were 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
light 
and 
the 
heights 
in 
pursuit 
of 
the 
goals 
of 
that 
hatred—victory, 
spoil, 
and 
seduction—by 
the 
same 
impulse 
that 
drove 
the 
roots 
of 
that 
hatred 
deeper 
and 
deeper 
and 
more 
and 
more 
covetously 
into 
all 
that 
was 
profound 
and 
evil. 
This 
Jesus 
of 
Nazareth, 
the 
incarnate 
gospel 
of 
love, 
this 
“Redeemer” 
who 
brought 
blessedness 
and 
victory 
to 
the 
poor, 
the 
sick, 
and 
the 
sinners—was 
he 
not 
this 
seduction 
in 
its 
most 
uncanny 
and 
irresistible 
form, 
a 
seduction 
and 
bypath 
to 
precisely 
those 
Jewish 
values 
and 
new 
ideals? 
Did 
Israel 
not 
attain 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
of 
its 
sublime 
vengefulness 
precisely 
through 
the 
bypath 
of 
this 
“Redeemer,” 
this 
ostensible 
opponent 
and 
disintegrator 
of 
Israel? 
Was 
it 
not 
part 
of 
the 
secret 
black 
art 
of 
truly 
grand 
politics 
of 
revenge, 
of 
a 
farseeing, 
subterranean, 
slowly 
advancing, 
and 
premeditated 
revenge, 
that 
Israel 
must 
itself 
deny 
the 
real 
instrument 
of 
its 
revenge 
before 
all 
the 
world 
as 
a 
mortal 
enemy 
and 
nail 
it 
to 
the 
cross, 
so 
that 
“all 
the 
world,” 
namely 
all 
the 
opponents 
of 
Israel, 
could 
unhesitatingly 
swallow 
just 
this 
bait? 
And 
could 
spiritual 
subtlety 
imagine 
any 
more 
dangerous 
bait 
than 
this? 
Anything 
to 
equal 
the 
enticing, 
intoxicating, 
overwhelming, 
and 
undermining 
power 
of 
that 
symbol 
of 
the 
“holy 
cross,” 
that 
ghastly 
paradox 
of 
a 
“God 
on 
the 
cross,” 
that 
mystery 
of 
an 
unimaginable 
ultimate 
cruelty 
and 
self-crucifixion 
of 
God 
for 
the 
salvation 
of 
man? 



What 
is 
certain, 
at 
least, 
is 
that 
sub 
hoc 
signo1 


Israel, 
with 
its 
vengefulness 
and 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values, 
has 
hitherto 
triumphed 
again 
and 
again 
over 
all 
other 
ideals, 
over 
all 
nobler 
ideals.——

“But 
why 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
nobler 
ideals! 
Let 
us 
stick 
to 
the 
facts: 
the 
people 
have 
won—or 
‘the 
slaves’ 
or 
‘the 
mob’ 
or 
‘the 
herd’ 
or 
whatever 
you 
like 
to 
call 
them—if 
this 
has 
happened 
through 
the 
Jews, 
very 
well! 
in 
that 
case 
no 
people 
ever 
had 
a 
more 
world-historic 
mission. 
‘The 
masters’ 
have 
been 
disposed 
of; 
the 
morality 
of 
the 
common 
man 
has 
won. 
One 
may 
conceive 
of 
this 
victory 
as 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
blood-poisoning 
(it 
has 
mixed 
the 
races 
together)—I 
shan’t 
contradict; 
but 
this 
in-toxication 
has 
undoubtedly 
been 
successful. 
The 
‘redemption’ 
of 
the 
human 
race 
(from 
‘the 
masters,’ 
that 
is) 
is 
going 
forward; 
everything 
is 
visibly 
becoming 
Judaized, 
Christianized, 
mob-ized 
(what 
do 
the 
words 
matter!). 
The 
progress 
of 
this 
poison 
through 
the 
entire 
body 
of 
mankind 
seems 
irresistible, 
its 
pace 
and 
tempo 
may 
from 
now 
on 
even 
grow 
slower, 
subtler, 
less 
audible, 
more 
cautious—there 
is 
plenty 
of 
time.— 
To 
this 
end, 
does 
the 
church 
today 
still 
have 
any 
necessary 
role 
to 
play? 
Does 
it 
still 
have 
the 
right 
to 
exist? 
Or 
could 
one 
do 
without 
it? 
Quaeritur.2 


It 
seems 
to 
hinder 
rather 
than 
hasten 
this 
progress. 
But 
perhaps 
that 
is 
its 
usefulness.— 
Certainly 
it 
has, 
over 
the 
years, 
become 
something 
crude 
and 
boorish, 
something 
repellent 
to 
a 
more 
delicate 
intellect, 
to 
a 
truly 
modern 
taste. 
Ought 
it 
not 
to 
become 
at 
least 
a 
little 
more 
refined?— 
Today 
it 
alienates 
rather 
than 
seduces.— 
Which 
of 
us 
would 
be 
a 
free 
spirit 
if 
the 
church 
did 
not 
exist? 
It 
is 
the 
church, 
and 
not 
its 
poison, 
that 
repels 
us.— 
Apart 
from 
the 
church, 
we, 
too, 
love 
the 
poison.—” 
This 
is 
the 
epilogue 
of 
a 
“free 
spirit” 
to 
my 
speech; 
an 
honest 
animal, 
as 
he 
has 
abundantly 
revealed, 
and 
a 
democrat, 
moreover; 
he 
had 
been 
listening 
to 
me 
till 
then 
and 
could 
not 
endure 
to 
listen 
to 
my 
silence. 
For 
at 
this 
point 
I 
have 
much 
to 
be 
silent 
about.

The 
slave 
revolt 
in 
morality 
begins 
when 
ressentiment1 
itself 
becomes 
creative 
and 
gives 
birth 
to 
values: 
the 
ressentiment 
of 
natures 
that 
are 
denied 
the 
true 
reaction, 
that 
of 
deeds, 
and 
compensate 
themselves 
with 
an 
imaginary 
revenge. 
While 
every 
noble 
morality 
develops 
from 
a 
triumphant 
affirmation 
of 
itself, 
slave 
morality 
from 
the 
outset 
says 
No 
to 
what 
is 
“outside,” 
what 
is 
“different,” 
what 
is 
“not 
itself”; 
and 
this 
No 
is 
its 
creative 
deed. 
This 
inversion 
of 
the 
value-positing 
eye—this 
need 
to 
direct 
one’s 
view 
outward 
instead 
of 
back 
to 
oneself—is 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
ressentiment: 
in 
order 
to 
exist, 
slave 
morality 
always 
first 
needs 
a 
hostile 
external 
world; 
it 
needs, 
physiologically 
speaking, 
external 
stimuli 
in 
order 
to 
act 
at 
all—its 
action 
is 
fundamentally 
reaction. 


The 
reverse 
is 
the 
case 
with 
the 
noble 
mode 
of 
valuation: 
it 
acts 
and 
grows 
spontaneously, 
it 
seeks 
its 
opposite 
only 
so 
as 
to 
affirm 
itself 
more 
gratefully 
and 
triumphantly—its 
negative 
concept 
“low,” 
“common,” 
“bad” 
is 
only 
a 
subsequently-invented 
pale, 
contrasting 
image 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
positive 
basic 
concept—filled 
with 
life 
and 
passion 
through 
and 
through—”we 
noble 
ones, 
we 
good, 
beautiful, 
happy 
ones!” 
When 
the 
noble 
mode 
of 
valuation 
blunders 
and 
sins 
against 
reality, 
it 
does 
so 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
sphere 
with 
which 
it 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
familiar, 
against 
a 
real 
knowledge 
of 
which 
it 
has 
indeed 
inflexibly 
guarded 
itself: 
in 
some 
circumstances 
it 
misunderstands 
the 
sphere 
it 
despises, 
that 
of 
the 
common 
man, 
of 
the 
lower 
orders; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
should 
remember 
that, 
even 
supposing 
that 
the 
affect 
of 
contempt, 
of 
looking 
down 
from 
a 
superior 
height, 
falsifies 
the 
image 
of 
that 
which 
it 
despises, 
it 
will 
at 
any 
rate 
still 
be 
a 
much 
less 
serious 
falsification 
than 
that 
perpetrated 
on 
its 
opponent—in 
effigie 
of 
course—by 
the 
submerged 
hatred, 
the 
vengefulness 
of 
the 
impotent. 
There 
is 
indeed 
too 
much 
carelessness, 
too 
much 
taking 
lightly, 
too 
much 
looking 
away 
and 
impatience 
involved 
in 
contempt, 
even 
too 
much 
joyfulness, 
for 
it 
to 
be 
able 
to 
transform 
its 
object 
into 
a 
real 
caricature 
and 
monster. 


One 
should 
not 
overlook 
the 
almost 
benevolent 
nuances 
that 
the 
Greek 
nobility, 
for 
example, 
bestows 
on 
all 
the 
words 
it 
employs 
to 
distinguish 
the 



lower 
orders 
from 
itself; 
how 
they 
are 
continuously 
mingled 
and 
sweetened 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
pity, 
consideration, 
and 
forbearance, 
so 
that 
finally 
almost 
all 
the 
words 
referring 
to 
the 
common 
man 
have 
remained 
as 
expressions 


23 
4

signifying 
“unhappy,” 
“pitiable” 
(compare 
deilos, 
deilaios, 
ponēros, 
mochthēros,5 
the 
last 
two 
of 
which 
properly 
designate 
the 
common 
man 
as 
work-slave 
and 
beast 
of 
burden)—and 
how 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
“bad,” 
“low,” 
“unhappy” 
have 
never 
ceased 
to 
sound 
to 
the 
Greek 
ear 
as 
one 
note 
with 
a 
tone-color 
in 
which 
“unhappy” 
preponderates: 
this 
as 
an 
inheritance 
from 
the 
ancient 
nobler 
aristocratic 
mode 
of 
evaluation, 
which 
does 
not 
belie 
itself 
even 
in 
its 
contempt 
(—philologists 
should 
recall 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
oïzyros,6 
anolbos,7 
tlēmōn,8 
dystychein9 
xymphora10 
are 
employed). 
The 
“well-born” 
felt 
themselves 
to 
be 
the 
“happy”; 
they 
did 
not 
have 
to 
establish 
their 
happiness 
artificially 
by 
examining 
their 
enemies, 
or 
to 
persuade 
themselves, 
deceive 
themselves, 
that 
they 
were 
happy 
(as 
all 
men 
of 
ressentiment 
are 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
doing); 
and 
they 
likewise 
knew, 
as 
rounded 
men 
replete 
with 
energy 
and 
therefore 
necessarily 
active, 
that 
happiness 
should 
not 
be 
sundered 
from 
action—being 
active 
was 
with 
them 
necessarily 
a 
part 
of 
happiness 
(whence 
eu 
prattein11 
takes 
its 
origin)—all 
very 
much 
the 
opposite 
of 
“happiness” 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
impotent, 
the 
oppressed, 
and 
those 
in 
whom 
poisonous 
and 
inimical 
feelings 
are 
festering, 
with 
whom 
it 
appears 
as 
essentially 
narcotic, 
drug, 
rest, 
peace, 
“sabbath,” 
slackening 
of 
tension 
and 
relaxing 
of 
limbs, 
in 
short 
passively. 


While 
the 
noble 
man 
lives 
in 
trust 
and 
openness 
with 
himself 
(gennaios12 
“of 
noble 
descent” 
underlines 
the 
nuance 
“upright” 
and 
probably 
also 
“naïve”), 
the 
man 
of 
ressentiment 
is 
neither 
upright 
nor 
naïve 
nor 
honest 
and 
straightforward 
with 
himself. 
His 
soul 
squints; 
his 
spirit 
loves 
hiding 
places, 
secret 
paths 
and 
back 
doors, 
everything 
covert 
entices 
him 
as 
his 
world, 
his 
security, 
his 
refreshment; 
he 
understands 
how 
to 
keep 
silent, 
how 
not 
to 
forget, 
how 
to 
wait, 
how 
to 
be 
provisionally 
self-deprecating 
and 
humble. 
A 
race 
of 
such 
men 
of 
ressentiment 
is 
bound 
to 
become 
eventually 
cleverer 
than 
any 
noble 
race; 
it 
will 
also 
honor 
cleverness 
to 
a 
far 
greater 
degree: 
namely, 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
existence 
of 
the 
first 
importanee; 
while 
with 
noble 
men 
cleverness 
can 
easily 
acquire 
a 
subtle 
flavor 
of 
luxury 
and 
subtlety—for 
here 
it 
is 
far 
less 
essential 
than 
the 
perfect 
functioning 
of 
the 
regulating 
unconscious 
instincts 
or 
even 
than 
a 
certain 
imprudence, 
perhaps 
a 
bold 
recklessness 
whether 
in 
the 
face 
of 
danger 
or 
of 
the 
enemy, 
or 
that 
enthusiastic 
impulsiveness 
in 
anger, 
love, 
reverence, 
gratitude, 
and 
revenge 



by 
which 
noble 
souls 
have 
at 
all 
times 
recognized 
one 
another. 
Ressentiment 
itself, 
if 
it 
should 
appear 
in 
the 
noble 
man, 
consummates 
and 
exhausts 
itself 
in 
an 
immediate 
reaction, 
and 
therefore 
does 
not 
poison: 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
fails 
to 
appear 
at 
all 
on 
countless 
occasions 
on 
which 
it 
inevitably 
appears 
in 
the 
weak 
and 
impotent. 


To 
be 
incapable 
of 
taking 
one’s 
enemies, 
one’s 
accidents, 
even 
one’s 
misdeeds 
seriously 
for 
very 
long—that 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
strong, 
full 
natures 
in 
whom 
there 
is 
an 
excess 
of 
the 
power 
to 
form, 
to 
mold, 
to 
recuperate 
and 
to 
forget 
(a 
good 
example 
of 
this 
in 
modern 
times 
is 
Mirabeau,13 
who 
had 
no 
memory 
for 
insults 
and 
vile 
actions 
done 
him 
and 
was 
unable 
to 
forgive 
simply 
because 
he—forgot). 
Such 
a 
man 
shakes 
off 
with 
a 
single 
shrug 
many 
vermin 
that 
eat 
deep 
into 
others; 
here 
alone 
genuine 
“love 
of 
one’s 
enemies” 
is 
possible—supposing 
it 
to 
be 
possible 
at 
all 
on 
earth. 
How 
much 
reverence 
has 
a 
noble 
man 
for 
his 
enemies!—and 
such 
reverence 
is 
a 
bridge 
to 
love.— 
For 
he 
desires 
his 
enemy 
for 
himself, 
as 
his 
mark 
of 
distinction; 
he 
can 
endure 
no 
other 
enemy 
than 
one 
in 
whom 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
despise 
and 
very 
much 
to 
honor! 
In 
contrast 
to 
this, 
picture 
“the 
enemy” 
as 
the 
man 
of 
ressentiment 
conceives 
him—and 
here 
precisely 
is 
his 
deed, 
his 
creation: 
he 
has 
conceived 
“the 
evil 
enemy,” 
“the 
Evil 
One,” 
and 
this 
in 
fact 
is 
his 
basic 
concept, 
from 
which 
he 
then 
evolves, 
as 
an 
afterthought 
and 
pendant, 
a 
“good 
one”—himself! 



11 


This, 
then, 
is 
quite 
the 
contrary 
of 
what 
the 
noble 
man 
does, 
who 
conceives 
the 
basic 
concept 
“good” 
in 
advance 
and 
spontaneously 
out 
of 
himself 
and 
only 
then 
creates 
for 
himself 
an 
idea 
of 
“bad”! 
This 
“bad” 
of 
noble 
origin 
and 
that 
“evil” 
out 
of 
the 
cauldron 
of 
unsatisfied 
hatred—the 
former 
an 
after-
production, 
a 
side 
issue, 
a 
contrasting 
shade, 
the 
latter 
on 
the 
contrary 
the 
original 
thing, 
the 
beginning, 
the 
distinctive 
deed 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
slave 
morality—how 
different 
these 
words 
“bad” 
and 
“evil” 
are, 
although 
they 
are 
both 
apparently 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
same 
concept 
“good.” 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
concept 
“good”: 
one 
should 
ask 
rather 
precisely 
who 
is 
“evil” 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
morality 
of 
ressentiment. 
The 
answer, 
in 
all 
strictness, 
is: 
precisely 
the 
“good 
man” 
of 
the 
other 
morality, 
precisely 
the 
noble, 
powerful 
man, 
the 
ruler, 
but 
dyed 
in 
another 
color, 
interpreted 
in 
another 
fashion, 
seen 
in 
another 
way 
by 
the 
venomous 
eye 
of 
ressentiment. 


Here 
there 
is 
one 
thing 
we 
shall 
be 
the 
last 
to 
deny: 
he 
who 
knows 
these 
“good 
men” 
only 
as 
enemies 
knows 
only 
evil 
enemies, 
and 
the 
same 
men 
who 
are 
held 
so 
sternly 
in 
check 
inter 
pares1 
by 
custom, 
respect, 
usage, 
gratitude, 
and 
even 
more 
by 
mutual 
suspicion 
and 
jealousy, 
and 
who 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
in 
their 
relations 
with 
one 
another 
show 
themselves 
so 
resourceful 
in 
consideration, 
self-control 
delicacy, 
loyalty, 
pride, 
and 
friendship—once 
they 
go 
outside, 
where 
the 
strange, 
the 
stranger 
is 
found, 
they 
are 
not 
much 
better 
than 
uncaged 
beasts 
of 
prey. 
There 
they 
savor 
a 
freedom 
from 
all 
social 
constraints, 
they 
compensate 
themselves 
in 
the 
wilderness 
for 
the 
tension 
engendered 
by 
protracted 
confinement 
and 
enclosure 
within 
the 
peace 
of 
society, 
they 
go 
back 
to 
the 
innocent 
conscience 
of 
the 
beast 
of 
prey, 
as 
triumphant 
monsters 
who 
perhaps 
emerge 
from 
a 
disgusting2 
procession 
of 
murder, 
arson, 
rape, 
and 
torture, 
exhilarated 
and 
undisturbed 
of 
soul, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
no 
more 
than 
a 
students’ 
prank, 
convinced 
they 
have 
provided 
the 
poets 
with 
a 
lot 
more 
material 
for 
song 
and 
praise. 
One 
cannot 
fail 
to 
see 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
all 
these 
noble 
races 
the 
beast 
of 
prey, 
the 
splendid 
blond 
beast3 
prowling 
about 
avidly 
in 
search 
of 
spoil 
and 
victory; 
this 
hidden 
core 
needs 
to 
erupt 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
the 
animal 
has 
to 
get 
out 
again 
and 
go 
back 
to 
the 



wilderness: 
the 
Roman, 
Arabian, 
Germanic, 
Japanese 
nobility, 
the 
Homeric 
heroes, 
the 
Scandinavian 
Vikings—they 
all 
shared 
this 
need. 


It 
is 
the 
noble 
races 
that 
have 
left 
behind 
them 
the 
concept 
“barbarian” 
wherever 
they 
have 
gone; 
even 
their 
highest 
culture 
betrays 
a 
consciousness 
of 
it 
and 
even 
a 
pride 
in 
it 
(for 
example, 
when 
Pericles 
says 
to 
his 
Athenians 
in 
his 
famous 
funeral 
oration 
“our 
boldness 
has 
gained 
access 
to 
every 
land 
and 
sea, 
everywhere 
raising 
imperishable 
monuments 
to 
its 
goodness 
and 
wickedness”). 
This 
“boldness” 
of 
noble 
races, 
mad, 
absurd, 
and 
sudden 
in 
its 
expression, 
the 
incalculability, 
even 
incredibility 
of 
their 
undertakings— 
Pericles 
specially 
commends 
the 
rhathymia4 
of 
the 
Athenians—their 
indifference 
to 
and 
contempt 
for 
security, 
body, 
life, 
comfort, 
their 
hairraising5 
cheerfulness 
and 
profound 
joy 
in 
all 
destruction, 
in 
all 
the 
voluptuousness 
of 
victory 
and 
cruelty—all 
this 
came 
together, 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
those 
who 
suffered 
from 
it, 
in 
the 
image 
of 
the 
“barbarian,” 
the 
“evil 
enemy,” 
perhaps 
as 
the 
“Goths,” 
the 
“Vandals.” 
The 
deep 
and 
icy 
mistrust 
the 
German 
still 
arouses 
today 
whenever 
he 
gets 
into 
a 
position 
of 
power 
is 
an 
echo 
of 
that 
inextinguishable 
horror 
with 
which 
Europe 
observed 
for 
centuries 
that 
raging 
of 
the 
blond 
Germanic 
beast 
(although 
between 
the 
old 
Germanic 
tribes 
and 
us 
Germans 
there 
exists 
hardly 
a 
conceptual 
relationship, 
let 
alone 
one 
of 
blood). 


Supposing 
that 
what 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
believed 
to 
be 
the 
“truth” 
really 
is 
true, 
and 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
culture 
is 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
beast 
of 
prey 
“man” 
to 
a 
tame 
and 
civilized 
animal, 
a 
domestic 
animal, 
then 
one 
would 
undoubtedly 
have 
to 
regard 
all 
those 
instincts 
of 
reaction 
and 
ressentiment 
through 
whose 
aid 
the 
noble 
races 
and 
their 
ideals 
were 
finally 
confounded 
and 
overthrown 
as 
the 
actual 
instruments 
of 
culture; 
which 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that 
the 
bearers 
of 
these 
instincts 
themselves 
represent 
culture. 
Rather 
is 
the 
reverse 
not 
merely 
probable—no! 
today 
it 
is 
palpable! 
These 
bearers 


I 
once 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
dilemma 
in 
which 
Hesiod 
found 
himself 
when 
he 
concocted 
his 
succession 
of 
cultural 
epochs 
and 
sought 
to 
express 
them 
in 
terms 
of 
gold, 
silver, 
and 
bronze: 
he 
knew 
no 
way 
of 
handling 
the 
contradiction 
presented 
by 
the 
glorious 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
terrible 
and 
violent 
world 
of 
Homer 
except 
by 
dividing 
one 
epoch 
into 
two 
epochs, 
which 
he 
then 
placed 
one 
behind 
the 
other—first 
the 
epoch 
of 
the 
heroes 
and 
demigods 
of 
Troy 
and 
Thebes, 
the 
form 
in 
which 
that 
world 
had 
survived 
in 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
noble 
races 
who 
were 
those 
heroes’ 
true 
descendants; 
then 
the 
bronze 
epoch, 
the 
form 
in 
which 
that 
same 
world 
appeared 
to 
the 



descendants 
of 
the 
downtrodden, 
pillaged, 
mistreated, 
abducted, 
enslaved: 
an 
epoch 
of 
bronze, 
as 
aforesaid, 
hard, 
cold, 
cruel, 
devoid 
of 
feeling 
or 
conscience, 
destructive 
and 
bloody. 
of 
the 
oppressive 
instincts 
that 
thirst 
for 
reprisal, 
the 
descendants 
of 
every 
kind 
of 
European 
and 
non-European 
slavery, 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
entire 
pre-Aryan 
populace—they 
represent 
the 
regression 
of 
mankind! 
These 
“instruments 
of 
culture” 
are 
a 
disgrace 
to 
man 
and 
rather 
an 
accusation 
and 
counterargument 
against 
“culture” 
in 
general! 
One 
may 
be 
quite 
justified 
in 
continuing 
to 
fear 
the 
blond 
beast 
at 
the 
core 
of 
all 
noble 
races 
and 
in 
being 
on 
one’s 
guard 
against 
it: 
but 
who 
would 
not 
a 
hundred 
times 
sooner 
fear 
where 
one 
can 
also 
admire 
than 
not 
fear 
but 
be 
permanently 
condemned 
to 
the 
repellent 
sight 
of 
the 
ill-constituted, 
dwarfed, 
atrophied, 
and 
poisoned?6 


And 
is 
that 
not 
our 
fate? 
What 
today 
constitutes 
our 
antipathy 
to 
“man”?— 
for 
we 
suffer 
from 
man, 
beyond 
doubt. 


Not 
fear; 
rather 
that 
we 
no 
longer 
have 
anything 
left 
to 
fear 
in 
man; 
that 
the 
maggot7 


“man” 
is 
swarming 
in 
the 
foreground; 
that 
the 
“tame 
man,” 
the 
hopelessly 
mediocre 
and 
insipid8 
man, 
has 
already 
learned 
to 
feel 
himself 
as 
the 
goal 
and 
zenith, 
as 
the 
meaning 
of 
history, 
as 
“higher 
man”—that 
he 
has 
indeed 
a 
certain 
right 
to 
feel 
thus, 
insofar 
as 
he 
feels 
himself 
elevated 
above 
the 
surfeit 
of 
ill-constituted, 
sickly, 
weary 
and 
exhausted 
people 
of 
which 
Europe 
is 
beginning 
to 
stink 
today, 
as 
something 
at 
least 
relatively 
well-constituted, 
at 
least 
still 
capable 
of 
living, 
at 
least 
affirming 
life. 



12 


At 
this 
point 
I 
cannot 
suppress 
a 
sigh 
and 
a 
last 
hope. 
What 
is 
it 
that 
I 
especially 
find 
utterly 
unendurable? 
That 
I 
cannot 
cope 
with, 
that 
makes 
me 
choke 
and 
faint? 
Bad 
air! 
Bad 
air! 
The 
approach 
of 
some 
ill-constituted 
thing; 
that 
I 
have 
to 
smell 
the 
entrails 
of 
some 
ill-constituted 
soul! 


How 
much 
one 
is 
able 
to 
endure: 
distress, 
want, 
bad 
weather, 
sickness, 
toil, 
solitude. 
Fundamentally 
one 
can 
cope 
with 
everything 
else, 
born 
as 
one 
is 
to 
a 
subterranean 
life 
of 
struggle; 
one 
emerges 
again 
and 
again 
into 
the 
light, 
one 
experiences 
again 
and 
again 
one’s 
golden 
hour 
of 
victory—and 
then 
one 
stands 
forth 
as 
one 
was 
born, 
unbreakable, 
tensed, 
ready 
for 
new, 
even 
harder, 
remoter 
things, 
like 
a 
bow 
that 
distress 
only 
serves 
to 
draw 
tauter. 


But 
grant 
me 
from 
time 
to 
time—if 
there 
are 
divine 
goddesses 
in 
the 
realm 
beyond 
good 
and 
evil—grant 
me 
the 
sight, 
but 
one 
glance 
of 
something 
perfect, 
wholly 
achieved, 
happy, 
mighty, 
triumphant, 
something 
still 
capable 
of 
arousing 
fear! 
Of 
a 
man 
who 
justifies 
man, 
of 
a 
complementary 
and 
redeeming 
lucky 
hit 
on 
the 
part 
of 
man 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
which 
one 
may 
still 
believe 
in 
man! 


For 
this 
is 
how 
things 
are: 
the 
diminution 
and 
leveling 
of 
European 
man 
constitutes 
our 
greatest 
danger, 
for 
the 
sight 
of 
him 
makes 
us 
weary.— 
We 
can 
see 
nothing 
today 
that 
wants 
to 
grow 
greater, 
we 
suspect 
that 
things 
will 
continue 
to 
go 
down, 
down, 
to 
become 
thinner, 
more 
good-natured, 
more 
prudent, 
more 
comfortable, 
more 
mediocre, 
more 
indifferent, 
more 
Chinese, 
more 
Christian—there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
man 
is 
getting 
“better” 
all 
the 
time. 


Here 
precisely 
is 
what 
has 
become 
a 
fatality 
for 
Europe—together 
with 
the 
fear 
of 
man 
we 
have 
also 
lost 
our 
love 
of 
him, 
our 
reverence 
for 
him, 
our 
hopes 
for 
him, 
even 
the 
will 
to 
him. 
The 
sight 
of 
man 
now 
makes 
us 
weary— 
what 
is 
nihilism 
today 
if 
it 
is 
not 
that?— 
We 
are 
weary 
of 
man. 



13 


But 
let 
us 
return: 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
other 
origin 
of 
the 
“good,” 
of 
the 
good 
as 
conceived 
by 
the 
man 
of 
ressentiment, 
demands 
its 
solution. 


That 
lambs 
dislike 
great 
birds 
of 
prey 
does 
not 
seem 
strange: 
only 
it 
gives 
no 
ground 
for 
reproaching 
these 
birds 
of 
prey 
for 
bearing 
off 
little 
lambs. 
And 
if 
the 
lambs 
say 
among 
themselves: 
“these 
birds 
of 
prey 
are 
evil; 
and 
whoever 
is 
least 
like 
a 
bird 
of 
prey, 
but 
rather 
its 
opposite, 
a 
lamb—would 
he 
not 
be 
good?” 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
this 
institution 
of 
an 
ideal, 
except 
perhaps 
that 
the 
birds 
of 
prey 
might 
view 
it 
a 
little 
ironically 
and 
say: 
“we 
don’t 
dislike 
them 
at 
all, 
these 
good 
little 
lambs; 
we 
even 
love 
them: 
nothing 
is 
more 
tasty 
than 
a 
tender 
lamb.” 


To 
demand 
of 
strength 
that 
it 
should 
not 
express 
itself 
as 
strength, 
that 
it 
should 
not 
be 
a 
desire 
to 
overcome, 
a 
desire 
to 
throw 
down, 
a 
desire 
to 
become 
master, 
a 
thirst 
for 
enemies 
and 
resistances 
and 
triumphs, 
is 
just 
as 
absurd 
as 
to 
demand 
of 
weakness 
that 
it 
should 
express 
itself 
as 
strength. 
A 
quantum 
of 
force 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
quantum 
of 
drive, 
will, 
effect—more, 
it 
is 
nothing 
other 
than 
precisely 
this 
very 
driving, 
willing, 
effecting, 
and 
only 
owing 
to 
the 
seduction 
of 
language 
(and 
of 
the 
fundamental 
errors 
of 
reason 
that 
are 
petrified 
in 
it) 
which 
conceives 
and 
misconceives 
all 
effects 
as 
conditioned 
by 
something 
that 
causes 
effects, 
by 
a 
“subject,” 
can 
it 
appear 
otherwise. 
For 
just 
as 
the 
popular 
mind 
separates 
the 
lightning 
from 
its 
flash 
and 
takes 
the 
latter 
for 
an 
action, 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
a 
subject 
called 
lightning, 
so 
popular 
morality 
also 
separates 
strength 
from 
expressions 
of 
strength, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
a 
neutral 
substratum 
behind 
the 
strong 
man, 
which 
was 
free 
to 
express 
strength 
or 
not 
to 
do 
so. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
such 
substratum; 
there 
is 
no 
“being” 
behind 
doing, 
effecting, 
becoming; 
“the 
doer” 
is 
merely 
a 
fiction 
added 
to 
the 
deed—the 
deed 
is 
everything. 
The 
popular 
mind 
in 
fact 
doubles 
the 
deed; 
when 
it 
sees 
the 
lightning 
flash, 
it 
is 
the 
deed 
of 
a 
deed: 
it 
posits 
the 
same 
event 
first 
as 
cause 
and 
then 
a 
second 
time 
as 
its 
effect. 
Scientists 
do 
no 
better 
when 
they 
say 
“force 
moves,” 
“force 
causes,” 
and 
the 
like—all 
its 
coolness, 
its 
freedom 
from 
emotion 
notwithstanding, 
our 
entire 
science 
still 
lies 
under 
the 
misleading 
influence 
of 
language 
and 
has 
not 
disposed 
of 
that 
little 
changeling, 
the 
“subject” 
(the 
atom, 
for 
example, 
is 



such 
a 
changeling, 
as 
is 
the 
Kantian 
“thing-in-itself”); 
no 
wonder 
if 
the 
submerged, 
darkly 
glowering 
emotions 
of 
vengefulness 
and 
hatred 
exploit 
this 
belief 
for 
their 
own 
ends 
and 
in 
fact 
maintain 
no 
belief 
more 
ardently 
than 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
strong 
man 
is 
free 
to 
be 
weak 
and 
the 
bird 
of 
prey 
to 
be 
a 
lamb—for 
thus 
they 
gain 
the 
right 
to 
make 
the 
bird 
of 
prey 
accountable 
for 
being 
a 
bird 
of 
prey. 


When 
the 
oppressed, 
downtrodden, 
outraged 
exhort 
one 
another 
with 
the 
vengeful 
cunning 
of 
impotence: 
“let 
us 
be 
different 
from 
the 
evil, 
namely 
good! 
And 
he 
is 
good 
who 
does 
not 
outrage, 
who 
harms 
nobody, 
who 
does 
not 
attack, 
who 
does 
not 
requite, 
who 
leaves 
revenge 
to 
God, 
who 
keeps 
himself 
hidden 
as 
we 
do, 
who 
avoids 
evil 
and 
desires 
little 
from 
life, 
like 
us, 
the 
patient, 
humble, 
and 
just”—this, 
listened 
to 
calmly 
and 
without 
previous 
bias, 
really 
amounts 
to 
no 
more 
than: 
“we 
weak 
ones 
are, 
after 
all, 
weak; 
it 
would 
be 
good 
if 
we 
did 
nothing 
for 
which 
we 
are 
not 
strong 
enough”; 
but 
this 
dry 
matter 
of 
fact, 
this 
prudence 
of 
the 
lowest 
order 
which 
even 
insects 
possess 
(posing 
as 
dead, 
when 
in 
great 
danger, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
do 
“too 
much”), 
has, 
thanks 
to 
the 
counterfeit 
and 
self-deception 
of 
impotence, 
clad 
itself 
in 
the 
ostentatious 
garb 
of 
the 
virtue 
of 
quiet, 
calm 
resignation, 
just 
as 
if 
the 
weakness 
of 
the 
weak—that 
is 
to 
say, 
their 
essence, 
their 
effects, 
their 
sole 
ineluctable, 
irremovable 
reality—were 
a 
voluntary 
achievement, 
willed, 
chosen, 
a 
deed,a 
meritorious 
act. 
This 
type 
of 
man 
needs 
to 
believe 
in 
a 
neutral 
independent 
“subject,” 
prompted 
by 
an 
instinct 
for 
self-preservation 
and 
self-affirmation 
in 
which 
every 
lie 
is 
sanctified. 
The 
subject 
(or, 
to 
use 
a 
more 
popular 
expression, 
the 
soul) 
has 
perhaps 
been 
believed 
in 
hitherto 
more 
firmly 
than 
anything 
else 
on 
earth 
because 
it 
makes 
possible 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
mortals, 
the 
weak 
and 
oppressed 
of 
every 
kind, 
the 
sublime 
self-
deception 
that 
interprets 
weakness 
as 
freedom, 
and 
their 
being 
thus-and-thus 
as 
a 
merit.

Would 
anyone 
like 
to 
take 
a 
look 
into 
the 
secret 
of 
how 
ideals 
are 
made 
on 
earth? 
Who 
has 
the 
courage?— 
Very 
well! 
Here 
is 
a 
point 
we 
can 
see 
through 
into 
this 
dark 
workshop. 
But 
wait 
a 
moment 
or 
two, 
Mr. 
Rash 
and 
Curious: 
your 
eyes 
must 
first 
get 
used 
to 
this 
false 
iridescent 
light.— 
All 
right! 
Now 
speak! 
What 
is 
going 
on 
down 
there? 
Say 
what 
you 
see, 
man 
of 
the 
most 
perilous 
kind 
of 
inquisitiveness—now 
I 
am 
the 
one 
who 
is 
listening.— 


—”I 
see 
nothing, 
but 
I 
hear 
the 
more. 
There 
is 
a 
soft, 
wary, 
malignant 
muttering 
and 
whispering 
coming 
from 
all 
the 
corners 
and 
nooks. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
one 
is 
lying; 
a 
saccharine 
sweetness 
clings 
to 
every 
sound. 
Weakness 
is 
being 
lied 
into 
something 
meritorious, 
no 
doubt 
of 
it—so 
it 
is 
just 
as 
you 
said”— 


—Go 
on! 


—”and 
impotence 
which 
does 
not 
requite 
into 
‘goodness 
of 
heart’; 
anxious 
lowliness 
into 
‘humility’; 
subjection 
to 
those 
one 
hates 
into 
‘obedience’ 
(that 
is, 
to 
one 
of 
whom 
they 
say 
he 
commands 
this 
subjection—they 
call 
him 
God). 
The 
inoffensiveness 
of 
the 
weak 
man, 
even 
the 
cowardice 
of 
which 
he 
has 
so 
much, 
his 
lingering 
at 
the 
door, 
his 
being 
ineluctably 
compelled 
to 
wait, 
here 
acquire 
flattering 
names, 
such 
as 
‘patience,’ 
and 
are 
even 
called 
virtue 
itself; 
his 
inability 
for 
revenge 
is 
called 
unwillingness 
to 
revenge, 
perhaps 
even 
forgiveness 
(‘for 
they 
know 
not 
what 
they 
do—we 
alone 
know 
what 
they 
do!’). 
They 
also 
speak 
of 
‘loving 
one’s 
enemies’— 
and 
sweat 
as 
they 
do 
so.” 


—Go 
on! 


—“They 
are 
miserable, 
no 
doubt 
of 
it, 
all 
these 
mutterers 
and 
nook 
counterfeiters, 
although 
they 
crouch 
warmly 
together—but 
they 
tell 
me 
their 
misery 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
being 
chosen 
by 
God; 
one 
beats 
the 
dogs 
one 
likes 
best; 
perhaps 
this 
misery 
is 
also 
a 
preparation, 
a 
testing, 
a 
schooling, 
perhaps 
it 
is 
even 
more—something 
that 
will 
one 
day 
be 
made 
good 
and 
recompensed 
with 
interest, 
with 
huge 
payments 
of 
gold, 
no! 
of 
happiness. 
This 
they 
call 
‘bliss.’ 
” 


—Go 
on! 


—“Now 
they 
give 
me 
to 
understand 
that 
they 
are 
not 
merely 
better 
than 
the 



mighty, 
the 
lords 
of 
the 
earth 
whose 
spittle 
they 
have 
to 
lick 
(not 
from 
fear, 
not 
at 
all 
from 
fear! 
but 
because 
God 
has 
commanded 
them 
to 
obey 
the 
authorities)1 


—that 
they 
are 
not 
merely 
better 
but 
are 
also 
‘better 
off,’ 
or 
at 
least 
will 
be 
better 
off 
someday. 
But 
enough! 
enough! 
I 
can’t 
take 
any 
more. 
Bad 
air! 
Bad 
air! 
This 
workshop 
where 
ideals 
are 
manufactured—it 
seems 
to 
me 
it 
stinks 
of 
so 
many 
lies.” 


—No! 
Wait 
a 
moment! 
You 
have 
said 
nothing 
yet 
of 
the 
masterpiece 
of 
these 
black 
magicians, 
who 
make 
whiteness, 
milk, 
and 
innocence 
of 
every 
blackness—haven’t 
you 
noticed 
their 
perfection 
of 
refinement, 
their 
boldest, 
subtlest, 
most 
ingenious, 
most 
mendacious 
artistic 
stroke? 
Attend 
to 
them! 
These 
cellar 
rodents 
full 
of 
vengefulness 
and 
hatred—what 
have 
they 
made 
of 
revenge 
and 
hatred? 
Have 
you 
heard 
these 
words 
uttered? 
If 
you 
trusted 
simply 
to 
their 
words, 
would 
you 
suspect 
you 
were 
among 
men 
of 
ressentiment? 
… 


—“I 
understand; 
I’ll 
open 
my 
ears 
again 
(oh! 
oh! 
oh! 
and 
close 
my 
nose). 
Now 
I 
can 
really 
hear 
what 
they 
have 
been 
saying 
all 
along: 
‘We 
good 
men— 
we 
are 
the 
just’—what 
they 
desire 
they 
call, 
not 
retaliation, 
but 
‘the 
triumph 
of 
justice’; 
what 
they 
hate 
is 
not 
their 
enemy, 
no! 
they 
hate 
‘injustice,’ 
they 
hate 
‘godlessness’; 
what 
they 
believe 
in 
and 
hope 
for 
is 
not 
the 
hope 
of 
revenge, 
the 
intoxication 
of 
sweet 
revenge 
(—‘sweeter 
than 
honey’ 
Homer 
called 
it), 
but 
the 
victory 
of 
God, 
of 
the 
just 
God, 
over 
the 
godless; 
what 
there 
is 
left 
for 
them 
to 
love 
on 
earth 
is 
not 
their 
brothers 
in 
hatred 
but 
their 
‘brothers 
in 
love,’ 
as 
they 
put 
it, 
all 
the 
good 
and 
just 
on 
earth.” 


—And 
what 
do 
they 
call 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
console 
them 
for 
all 
the 
suffering 
of 
life—their 
phantasmagoria 
of 
anticipated 
future 
bliss? 


—“What? 
Do 
I 
hear 
aright? 
They 
call 
that 
‘the 
Last 
Judgment,’ 
the 
coming 
of 
their 
kingdom, 
of 
the 
‘Kingdom 
of 
God’— 
meanwhile, 
however, 
they 
live 
‘in 
faith,’ 
‘in 
love,’ 
‘in 
hope.’ 
” 


—Enough! 
Enough! 



15 


In 
faith 
in 
what? 
In 
love 
of 
what? 
In 
hope 
of 
what?— 
These 
weak 
people 
—some 
day 
or 
other 
they 
too 
intend 
to 
be 
the 
strong, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
that, 
some 
day 
their 
“kingdom” 
too 
shall 
come—they 
term 
it 
“the 
kingdom 
of 
God,” 
of 
course, 
as 
aforesaid: 
for 
one 
is 
so 
very 
humble 
in 
all 
things! 
To 
experience 
that 
one 
needs 
to 
live 
a 
long 
time, 
beyond 
death—indeed 
one 
needs 
eternal 
life, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
eternally 
indemnified 
in 
the 
“kingdom 
of 
God” 
for 
this 
earthly 
life 
“in 
faith, 
in 
love, 
in 
hope.” 
Indemnified 
for 
what? 
How 
indemnified? 


Dante, 
I 
think, 
committed 
a 
crude 
blunder 
when, 
with 
a 
terror-inspiring 
ingenuity, 
he 
placed 
above 
the 
gateway 
of 
his 
hell 
the 
inscription 
“I 
too 
was 
created 
by 
eternal 
love”—at 
any 
rate, 
there 
would 
be 
more 
justification 
for 
placing 
above 
the 
gateway 
to 
the 
Christian 
Paradise 
and 
its 
“eternal 
bliss” 
the 
inscription 
“I 
too 
was 
created 
by 
eternal 
hate”—provided 
a 
truth 
may 
be 
placed 
above 
the 
gateway 
to 
a 
lie! 
For 
what 
is 
it 
that 
constitutes 
the 
bliss 
of 
this 
Paradise? 


We 
might 
even 
guess, 
but 
it 
is 
better 
to 
have 
it 
expressly 
described 
for 
us 
by 
an 
authority 
not 
to 
be 
underestimated 
in 
such 
matters, 
Thomas 
Aquinas, 
the 
great 
teacher 
and 
saint. 
“Beati 
in 
regno 
coelesti,” 
he 
says, 
meek 
as 
a 
lamb, 
“videbunt 
poenas 
damnatorum, 
ut 
beatitudo 
illis 
magis 
complaceat.”1 


Or 
if 
one 
would 
like 
to 
hear 
it 
in 
a 
stronger 
key, 
perhaps 
from 
the 
mouth 
of 
a 
triumphant 
Church 
Father, 
adjuring 
his 
Christians 
to 
avoid 
the 
cruel 
pleasures 
of 
the 
public 
games—but 
why? 
“For 
the 
faith 
offers 
us 
much 
more”—he 
says, 
De 
Spectaculis, 
chs. 
29f.—“something 
much 
stronger; 
thanks 
to 
the 
Redemption, 
quite 
other 
joys 
are 
at 
our 
command; 
in 
place 
of 
athletes 
we 
have 
our 
martyrs; 
if 
we 
crave 
blood, 
we 
have 
the 
blood 
of 
Christ 
… 
But 
think 
of 
what 
awaits 
us 
on 
the 
day 
of 
his 
return, 
the 
day 
of 
his 
triumph!”—and 
then 
he 
goes 
on, 
the 
enraptured 
visionary.2 


“At

—Per

thus 
is 
it 
written. 



16 


Let 
us 
conclude. 
The 
two 
opposing 
values 
“good 
and 
bad,” 
“good 
and 
evil” 
have 
been 
engaged 
in 
a 
fearful 
struggle 
on 
earth 
for 
thousands 
of 
years; 
and 
though 
the 
latter 
value 
has 
certainly 
been 
on 
top 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
there 
are 
still 
places 
where 
the 
struggle 
is 
as 
yet 
undecided. 
One 
might 
even 
say 
that 
it 
has 
risen 
ever 
higher 
and 
thus 
become 
more 
and 
more 
profound 
and 
spiritual: 
so 
that 
today 
there 
is 
perhaps 
no 
more 
decisive 
mark 
of 
a 
“higher 
nature,” 
a 
more 
spiritual 
nature, 
than 
that 
of 
being 
divided 
in 
this 
sense 
and 
a 
genuine 
battleground 
of 
these 
opposed 
values.1 


The 
symbol 
of 
this 
struggle, 
inscribed 
in 
letters 
legible 
across 
all 
human 
history, 
is 
“Rome 
against 
Judea, 
Judea 
against 
Rome”:—there 
has 
hitherto 
been 
no 
greater 
event 
than 
this 
struggle, 
this 
question, 
this 
deadly 
contradiction. 
Rome 
felt 
the 
Jew 
to 
be 
something 
like 
anti-nature 
itself, 
its 
antipodal 
monstrosity 
as 
it 
were: 
in 
Rome 
the 
Jew 
stood 
“convicted 
of 
hatred 
for 
the 
whole 
human 
race”; 
and 
rightly, 
provided 
one 
has 
a 
right 
to 
link 
the 
salvation 
and 
future 
of 
the 
human 
race 
with 
the 
unconditional 
dominance 
of 
aristocratic 
values, 
Roman 
values. 


How, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
did 
the 
Jews 
feel 
about 
Rome? 
A 
thousand 
signs 
tell 
us; 
but 
it 
suffices 
to 
recall 
the 
Apocalypse 
of 
John, 
the 
most 
wanton 
of 
all 
literary 
outbursts 
that 
vengefulness 
has 
on 
its 
conscience. 
(One 
should 
not 
underestimate 
the 
profound 
consistency 
of 
the 
Christian 
instinct 
when 
it 
signed 
this 
book 
of 
hate 
with 
the 
name 
of 
the 
disciple 
of 
love, 
the 
same 
disciple 
to 
whom 
it 
attributed 
that 
amorous-enthusiastic 
Gospel: 
there 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
truth 
in 
this, 
however 
much 
literary 
counterfeiting 
might 
have 
been 
required 
to 
produce 
it.) 
For 
the 
Romans 
were 
the 
strong 
and 
noble, 
and 
nobody 
stronger 
and 
nobler 
has 
yet 
existed, 
on 
earth 
or 
even 
been 
dreamed 
of: 
every 
remnant 
of 
them, 
every 
inscription 
gives 
delight, 
if 
only 
one 
divines 
what 
it 
was 
that 
was 
there 
at 
work. 
The 
Jews, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
were 
the 
priestly 
nation 
of 
ressentiment 
par 
excellence, 
in 
whom 
there 
dwelt 
an 
unequaled 
popular-moral 
genius: 
one 
only 
has 
to 
compare 
similarly 
gifted 
nations—the 
Chinese 
or 
the 
Germans, 
for 
instance—with 
the 
Jews, 
to 
sense 
which 
is 
of 
the 
first 
and 
which 
of 
the 
fifth 
rank.2 



Which 
of 
them 
has 
won 
for 
the 
present, 
Rome 
or 
Judea? 
But 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt: 
consider 
to 
whom 
one 
bows 
down 
in 
Rome 
itself 
today, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
the 
epitome 
of 
all 
the 
highest 
values—and 
not 
only 
in 
Rome 
but 
over 
almost 
half 
the 
earth, 
everywhere 
that 
man 
has 
become 
tame 
or 
desires 
to 
become 
tame: 
three 
Jews, 
as 
is 
known, 
and 
one 
Jewess 
(Jesus 
of 
Nazareth, 
the 
fisherman 
Peter, 
the 
rug 
weaver 
Paul, 
and 
the 
mother 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
Jesus, 
named 
Mary). 
This 
is 
very 
remarkable: 
Rome 
has 
been 
defeated 
beyond 
all 
doubt. 


There 
was, 
to 
be 
sure, 
in 
the 
Renaissance 
an 
uncanny 
and 
glittering 
reawakening 
of 
the 
classical 
ideal, 
of 
the 
noble 
mode 
of 
evaluating 
all 
things; 
Rome 
itself, 
oppressed 
by 
the 
new 
superimposed 
Judaized 
Rome 
that 
presented 
the 
aspect 
of 
an 
ecumenical 
synagogue 
and 
was 
called 
the 
“church,” 
stirred 
like 
one 
awakened 
from 
seeming 
death: 
but 
Judea 
immediately 
triumphed 
again, 
thanks 
to 
that 
thoroughly 
plebeian 
(German 
and 
English) 
ressentiment 
movement 
called 
the 
Reformation, 
and 
to 
that 
which 
was 
bound 
to 
arise 
from 
it, 
the 
restoration 
of 
the 
church—the 
restoration 
too 
of 
the 
ancient 
sepulchral 
repose 
of 
classical 
Rome. 


With 
the 
French 
Revolution, 
Judea 
once 
again 
triumphed 
over 
the 
classical 
ideal, 
and 
this 
time 
in 
an 
even 
more 
profound 
and 
decisive 
sense: 
the 
last 
political 
noblesse 
in 
Europe, 
that 
of 
the 
French 
seventeenth 
and 
eighteenth 
century, 
collapsed 
beneath 
the 
popular 
instincts 
of 
ressentiment—greater 
rejoicing, 
more 
uproarious 
enthusiasm 
had 
never 
been 
heard 
on 
earth! 
To 
be 
sure, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
it 
there 
occurred 
the 
most 
tremendous, 
the 
most 
unexpected 
thing; 
the 
ideal 
of 
antiquity 
itself 
stepped 
incarnate 
and 
in 
unheard-of 
splendor 
before 
the 
eyes 
and 
conscience 
of 
mankind—and 
once 
again, 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
mendacious 
slogan 
of 
ressentiment, 
“supreme 
rights 
of 
the 
majority,” 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
will 
to 
the 
lowering, 
the 
abasement, 
the 
leveling 
and 
the 
decline 
and 
twilight 
of 
mankind, 
there 
sounded 
stronger, 
simpler, 
and 
more 
insistently 
than 
ever 
the 
terrible 
and 
rapturous 
counterslogan 
“supreme 
rights 
of 
the 
few”! 
Like 
a 
last 
signpost 
to 
the 
other 
path, 
Napoleon 
appeared, 
the 
most 
isolated 
and 
late-born 
man 
there 
has 
even 
been, 
and 
in 
him 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
noble 
ideal 
as 
such 
made 
flesh 
—one 
might 
well 
ponder 
what 
kind 
of 
problem 
it 
is: 
Napoleon, 
this 
synthesis 
of 
the 
inhuman 
and 
superhuman. 



17 


Was 
that 
the 
end 
of 
it? 
Had 
that 
greatest 
of 
all 
conflicts 
of 
ideals 
been 
placed 
ad 
acta1 
for 
all 
time? 
Or 
only 
adjourned, 
indefinitely 
adjourned? 


Must 
the 
ancient 
fire 
not 
some 
day 
flare 
up 
much 
more 
terribly, 
after 
much 
longer 
preparation? 
More: 
must 
one 
not 
desire 
it 
with 
all 
one’s 
might? 
even 
will 
it? 
even 
promote 
it? 


Whoever 
begins 
at 
this 
point, 
like 
my 
readers, 
to 
reflect 
and 
pursue 
his 
train 
of 
thought 
will 
not 
soon 
come 
to 
the 
end 
of 
it—reason 
enough 
for 
me 
to 
come 
to 
an 
end, 
assuming 
it 
has 
long 
since 
been 
abundantly 
clear 
what 
my 
aim 
is, 
what 
the 
aim 
of 
that 
dangerous 
slogan 
is 
that 
is 
inscribed 
at 
the 
head 
of 
my 
last 
book 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil.— 
At 
least 
this 
does 
not 
mean 
“Beyond 
Good 
and 
Bad.”—— 


Note.2 
I 
take 
the 
opportunity 
provided 
by 
this 
treatise 
to 
express 
publicly 
and 
formally 
a 
desire 
I 
have 
previously 
voiced 
only 
in 
occasional 
conversation 
with 
scholars; 
namely, 
that 
some 
philosophical 
faculty 
might 
advance 
historical 
studies 
of 
morality 
through 
a 
series 
of 
academic 
prize-essays— 
perhaps 
this 
present 
book 
will 
serve 
to 
provide 
a 
powerful 
impetus 
in 
this 
direction. 
In 
case 
this 
idea 
should 
be 
implemented, 
I 
suggest 
the 
following 
question: 
it 
deserves 
the 
attention 
of 
philologists 
and 
historians 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
professional 
philosophers: 


“What 
light 
does 
linguistics, 
and 
especially 
the 
study 
of 
etymology, 
throw 
on 
the 
history 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
moral 
concepts?” 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
equally 
necessary 
to 
engage 
the 
interest 
of 
physiologists 
and 
doctors 
in 
these 
problems 
(of 
the 
value 
of 
existing 
evaluations); 
it 
may 
be 
left 
to 
academic 
philosophers 
to 
act 
as 
advocates 
and 
mediators 
in 
this 
matter 
too, 
after 
they 
have 
on 
the 
whole 
succeeded 
in 
the 
past 
in 
transforming 
the 
originally 
so 
reserved 
and 
mistrustful 
relations 
between 
philosophy, 
physiology, 
and 
medicine 
into 
the 
most 
amicable 
and 
fruitful 
exchange. 
Indeed, 
every 
table 
of 
values, 
every 
“thou 
shalt” 
known 
to 
history 
or 
ethnology, 
requires 
first 
a 
physiological 
investigation 
and 
interpretation, 
rather 
than 
a 
psychological 
one; 
and 
every 
one 
of 
them 
needs 
a 



critique 
on 
the 
part 
of 
medical 
science. 
The 
question: 
what 
is 
the 
value 
of 
this 
or 
that 
table 
of 
values 
and 
“morals”? 
should 
be 
viewed 
from 
the 
most 
divers 
perspectives; 
for 
the 
problem 
“value 
for 
what?” 
cannot 
be 
examined 
too 
subtly. 
Something, 
for 
example, 
that 
possessed 
obvious 
value 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
longest 
possible 
survival 
of 
a 
race 
(or 
to 
the 
enhancement 
of 
its 
power 
of 
adaptation 
to 
a 
particular 
climate 
or 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
greatest 
number) 
would 
by 
no 
means 
possess 
the 
same 
value 
if 
it 
were 
a 
question, 
for 
instance, 
of 
producing 
a 
stronger 
type. 
The 
well-being 
of 
the 
majority 
and 
the 
well-being 
of 
the 
few 
are 
opposite 
viewpoints 
of 
value: 
to 
consider 
the 
former 
a 
priori 
of 
higher 
value 
may 
be 
left 
to 
the 
naïveté 
of 
English 
biologists.— 
All 
the 
sciences 
have 
from 
now 
on 
to 
prepare 
the 
way 
for 
the 
future 
task 
of 
the 
philosophers: 
this 
task 
understood 
as 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
value, 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
among 
values.

Nietzsche’s 
first 
publication, 
in 
1867 
when 
he 
was 
still 
a 
student 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Leipzig, 
was 
an 
article 
in 
a 
leading 
classical 
journal, 
Rheinisches

on 
the 
history 
of 
the 
collection 
of 
the 
maxims 
of 
Theognis 
(“Zur 
Geschichte 
der

Greek: 
good,

Readers 
who 
are 
not 
classical 
philologists 
may 
wonder 
as 
they 
read 
this 
section 
how 
well 
taken 
Nietzsche’s 
points 
about 
the 
Greeks 
are. 
In 
this 
connection 
one 
could 
obviously 
cite 
a 
vast 
literature, 
but 
in 
this 
brief 
commentary 
it 
will 
be 
sufficient 
to 
quote 
Professor 
Gerald 
F. 
Else’s 
monumental 
study 
Aristotle’s 
Poetics: 
The 
Argument 
(Cambridge, 
Mass., 
Harvard 
University 
Press, 
1957), 
a 
work 
equally 
notable 
for 
its 
patient 
and 
thorough 
scholarship 
and 
its 
spirited 



defense 
of 
some 
controversial 
interpretations. 
On 
the 
points 
at 
issue 
here, 
Else’s 
comments 
are 
not, 
I 
think, 
controversial; 
and 
that 
is 
the 
reason 
for 
citing 
them 
here. 


“The 
dichotomy 
is 
mostly 
taken 
for 
granted 
in 
Homer: 
there 
are 
not 
many 
occasions 
when 
the 
heaven-wide 
gulf 
between 
heroes 
and 
commoners 
even 
has 
to 
be 
mentioned.30 
[30 
Still, 
one 
finds 
‘good’ 
(esthloi) 
and 
‘bad’ 
(kakoi) 
explicitly 
contrasted 
a 
fair 
number 
of 
times: 
B366, 
Z489, 
1319, 
…] 
In 
the 
… 
seventh 
and 
sixth 
centuries, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
antithesis 
grows 
common. 
In 
Theognis 
it 
amounts 
to 
an 
obsession 
… 
Greek 
thinking 
begins 
with 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
holds 
to 
the 
proposition 
that 
mankind 
is 
divided 
into 
‘good’ 
and 
‘bad,’ 
and 
these 
terms 
are 
quite 
as 
much 
social, 
political, 
and 
economic 
as 
they 
are 
moral.… 
The 
dichotomy 
is 
absolute 
and 
exclusive 
for 
a 
simple 
reason: 
it 
began 
as 
the 
aristocrats’ 
view 
of 
society 
and 
reflects 
their 
idea 
of 
the 
gulf 
between 
themselves 
and 
the 
‘others.’ 
In 
the 
minds 
of 
a 
comparatively 
small 
and 
close-knit 
group 
like 
the 
Greek 
aristocracy 
there 
are 
only 
two 
kinds 
of 
people, 
‘we’ 
and 
‘they’; 
and 
of 
course 
‘we’ 
are 
the 
good 
people, 
the 
proper, 
decent, 
good-looking, 
right-thinking 
ones, 
while 
‘they’ 
are 
the 
rascals, 
the 
poltroons, 
the 
good-fornothings 
… 
Aristotle 
knew 
and 
sympathized 
with 
this 
older 
aristocratic, 
‘practical’ 
ideal, 
not 
as 
superior 
to 
the 
contemplative, 
but 
at 
least 
as 
next 
best 
to 
it” 
(p. 
75).

Greek:

Quoted 
from 
Horace’s 
Satires, 
I.4, 
line 
85: 
“He 
that 
backbites 
an 
absent 
friend 
… 
and 
cannot 
keep 
secrets, 
is 
black, 
O 
Roman, 
beware!” 
Niger, 
originally 
“black,” 
also 
came 
to 
mean 
unlucky 
and, 
as 
in 
this 
quotation, 
wicked. 
Conversely, 
candidus 
means 
white, 
bright, 
beautiful, 
pure, 
guileless, 
candid, 
honest, 
happy, 
fortunate. 
And 
in 
Satires, 
1.5, 
41, 
Horace 
speaks 
of 
“the 
whitest 
souls 
earth 
ever 
bore” 
(animae 
qualis 
neque 
candidiores 
terra 
tulit).

This 
is 
the 
first 
appearance 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
writings 
of 
the 
notorious 



“blond 
beast.” 
It 
is 
encountered 
twice 
more 
in 
the 
present 
section; 
a 
variant 
appears 
in 
section 
17 
of 
the 
second 
essay; 
and 
then 
the 
blonde 
Bestie 
appears 
once 
more 
in 
Twilight, 
“The 
‘Improvers’ 
of 
Mankind,” 
section 
2 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
p. 
502). 
That 
is 
all. 
For 
a 
detailed 
discussion 
of 
these 
passages 
see 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
7, 
section 
III: 
“… 
The 
‘blond 
beast’ 
is 
not 
a 
racial 
concept 
and 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
‘Nordic 
race’ 
of 
which 
the 
Nazis 
later 
made 
so 
much. 
Nietzsche 
specifically 
refers 
to 
Arabs 
and 
Japanese 
…—and 
the 
‘blondness’ 
presumably 
refers 
to 
the 
beast, 
the 
lion.” 


Francis 
Golffing, 
in 
his 
free 
translation 
of 
the 
Genealogy, 
deletes 
the 
blond 
beast 
three 
times 
out 
of 
four; 
only 
where 
it 
appears 
the 
second 
time 
in 
the 
original 
text, 
he 
has 
“the 
blond 
Teutonic 
beast.” 
This 
helps 
to 
corroborate 
the 
myth 
that 
the 
blondness 
refers 
to 
the 
Teutons. 
Without 
the 
image 
of 
the 
lion, 
however, 
we 
lose 
not 
only 
some 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
poetry 
as 
well 
as 
any 
chance 
to 
understand 
one 
of 
his 
best 
known 
coinages; 
we 
also 
lose 
an 
echo 
of 
the 
crucial 
first 
chapter 
of 
Zarathustra, 
where 
the 
lion 
represents 
the 
second 
stage 
in 
“The 
Three 
Metamorphoses” 
of 
the 
spirit—above 
the 
obedient 
camel 
but 
below 
the 
creative 
child 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
138f.). 


Arthur 
Danto 
has 
suggested 
that 
if 
lions 
were 
black 
and 
Nietzsche 
had 
written 
“Black 
Beast,” 
the 
expression 
would 
“provide 
support 
for 
African 
instead 
of 
German 
nationalists” 
(Nietzsche 
as 
Philosopher, 
New 
York, 
Macmillan, 
1965, 
p. 
170). 
Panthers 
are 
black 
and 
magnificent 
animals, 
but 
anyone 
calling 
Negroes 
black 
beasts 
and 
associating 
them 
with 
“a 
disgusting 
procession 
of 
murder, 
arson, 
rape, 
and 
torture,” 
adding 
that 
“the 
animal 
has 
to 
get 
out 
again 
and 
go 
back 
to 
the 
wilderness,” 
and 
then 
going 
on 
to 
speak 
of 
“their 
hair-raising 
cheerfulness 
and 
profound 
joy 
in 
all 
destruction,” 
would 
scarcely 
be 
taken 
to 
“provide 
support 
for 
… 
nationalists.” 
On 
the 
contrary, 
he 
would 
be 
taken 
for 
a 
highly 
prejudiced 
critic 
of 
the 
Negro. 


No 
other 
German 
writer 
of 
comparable 
stature 
has 
been 
a 
more 
extreme 
critic 
of 
German 
nationalism 
than 
Nietzsche. 
For 
all 
that, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
in 
this 
section 
he 
sought 
to 
describe 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
ancient 
Greeks 
and 
Romans, 
the 
Goths 
and 
the 
Vandals, 
not 
that 
of 
nineteenth-
century 
Germans.

how 
Aldous 
Huxley’s

New 
World 
and 
George 
Orwell’s 
1984—but 
especially 
the 
former—are 
developments 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
theme. 
Huxley, 
in 
his 
novel, 
uses 
Shakespeare 
as 
a 
foil; 
Nietzsche,

Homer.

Nietzsche 
quotes 
Tertullian 
in 
the 
original 
Latin. 
This 
footnote 
offers, 
first, 
an 
English 
translation, 
and 
then 
some 
discussion. 


“Yes, 
and 
there 
are 
other 
sights: 
that 
last 
day 
of 
judgment, 
with 
its 
everlasting 
issues; 
that 
day 
unlooked 
for 
by 
the 
nations, 
the 
theme 
of 
their 
derision, 
when 
the 
world 
hoary 
with 
age, 
and 
all 
its 
many 
products, 
shall 
be 
consumed 
in 
one 
great 
flame! 
How 
vast 
a 
spectacle 
then 
bursts 
upon 
the 
eye! 
What 
there 
excites 
my 
admiration? 
what 
my 
derision? 
Which 
sight 
gives 
me 
joy? 
which 
rouses 
me 
to 
exultation?—as 
I 
see 
so 
many 
illustrious 
monarchs, 
whose 
reception 
into 
the 
heavens 
was 
publicly 
announced, 
groaning 
now 
in 
the 
lowest 
darkness 
with 
great 



Jove 
himself, 
and 
those, 
too, 
who 
bore 
witness 
of 
their 
exultation; 
governors 
of 
provinces, 
too, 
who 
persecuted 
the 
Christian 
name, 
in 
fires 
more 
fierce 
than 
those 
with 
which 
in 
the 
days 
of 
their 
pride 
they 
raged 
against 
the 
followers 
of 
Christ. 
What 
world’s 
wise 
men 
besides, 
the 
very 
philosophers, 
in 
fact, 
who 
taught 
their 
followers 
that 
God 
had 
no 
concern 
in 
aught 
that 
is 
sublunary, 
and 
were 
wont 
to 
assure 
them 
that 
either 
they 
had 
no 
souls, 
or 
that 
they 
would 
never 
return 
to 
the 
bodies 
which 
at 
death 
they 
had 
left, 
now 
covered 
with 
shame 
before 
the 
poor 
deluded 
ones, 
as 
one 
fire 
consumes 
them! 
Poets 
also, 
trembling 
not 
before 
the 
judgment-seat 
of 
Rhadamanthus 
or 
Minos, 
but 
of 
the 
unexpected 
Christ! 
I 
shall 
have 
a 
better 
opportunity 
then 
of 
hearing 
the 
tragedians, 
louder-voiced 
in 
their 
own 
calamity; 
of 
viewing 
the 
play-
actors, 
much 
more 
‘dissolute’ 
[another 
translation 
has 
“much 
lither 
of 
limb”] 
in 
the 
dissolving 
flame; 
of 
looking 
upon 
the 
charioteer, 
all 
glowing 
in 
his 
chariot 
of 
fire; 
of 
beholding 
the 
wrestlers, 
not 
in 
their 
gymnasia, 
but 
tossing 
in 
the 
fiery 
billows; 
unless 
even 
then 
I 
shall 
not 
care 
to 
attend 
to 
such 
ministers 
of 
sin, 
in 
my 
eager 
wish 
rather 
to 
fix 
a 
gaze 
insatiable 
on 
those 
whose 
fury 
vented 
itself 
against 
the 
Lord. 
‘This,’ 
I 
shall 
say, 
‘this 
is 
that 
carpenter’s 
or 
hireling’s 
son, 
that 
Sabbath-breaker, 
that 
Samaritan 
and 
devil-possessed! 
This 
is 
He 
whom 
you 
purchased 
from 
Judas! 
[Quaestuaria 
means 
prostitute, 
not 
carpenter: 
see 
Nietzsche’s 
parenthesis 
above.] 
This 
is 
He 
whom 
you 
struck 
with 
reed 
and 
fist, 
whom 
you 
contemptuously 
spat 
upon, 
to 
whom 
you 
gave 
gall 
and 
vinegar 
to 
drink! 
This 
is 
He 
whom 
His 
disciples 
secretly 
stole 
away, 
that 
it 
might 
be 
said 
He 
had 
risen 
again, 
or 
the 
gardener 
abstracted, 
that 
his 
lettuces 
might 
come 
to 
no 
harm 
from 
the 
crowds 
of 
visitants!’ 
What 
quaestor 
or 
priest 
in 
his 
munificence 
will 
bestow 
on 
you 
the 
favour 
of 
seeing 
and 
exulting 
in 
such 
things 
as 
these? 
And 
yet 
even 
now 
we 
in 
a 
measure 
have 
them 
by 
faith 
in 
the 
picturings 
of 
imagination. 
But 
what 
are 
the 
things 
which 
eye 
has 
not 
seen, 
ear 
has 
not 
heard, 
and 
which 
have 
not 
so 
much 
as 
dimly 
dawned 
upon 
the 
human 
heart? 
Whatever 
they 
are, 
they 
are 
nobler, 
I 
believe, 
than 
circus, 
and 
both 
theatres, 
and 
every 
race-course.” 
[Translation

the 
Rev. 
S. 
Thelwall.] 
There 
are 
two 
standard 
translations 
of 
Tertullian’s 
De 
Spectaculis.

is

Alexander

III:

Christianity:

of

In 
the 
former 
edition 
we 
are 
told 
in 
a 
footnote 
to 
the 
title 
that 
although 
there 
has 
been 
some 
dispute 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
work 
was 
written 
before 
or 
after 
Tertullian’s 
“lapse” 
from 
orthodoxy 
to 
Montanism, 
“a 
work 
so 
colourless 
that 
doctors 
can 
disagree 
about 
even 
its 
shading, 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
practically 
orthodox. 
Exaggerated 
expressions 
are 
but 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
author’s 
genius. 
We 
find 
the 
like 
in 
all 
writers 
of 
strongly 
marked 
individuality. 
Neander 
dates 
this 
treatise 
circa 
A.D. 
197.” 
And 
in 
a 
footnote 
to 
the 
last 
sentence 
quoted 
by 
Nietzsche, 
which 
concludes 
the 
last 
chapter 
of 
the 
treatise, 
we 
read: 
“This 
concluding 
chapter, 
which 
Gibbon 
delights 
to 
censure, 
because 
its 
fervid 
rhetoric 
so 
fearfully 
depicts 
the 
punishments 
of 
Christ’s 
enemies, 
‘appears 
to 
Dr. 
Neander 
to 
contain 
a 
beautiful 
specimen 
of 
lively 
faith 
and 
Christian 
confidence.’ 
” 


In 
the 
latter 
edition 
we 
are 
informed 
that 
“De 
Spectaculis 
is 
one 
of 
Tertullian’s 
most 
interesting 
and 
original 
works” 
(p. 
38). 
And 
Chapter 
30, 
which 
Nietzsche 
quotes 
almost 
in 
its 
entirety, 
omitting 
only 
the 
first 
four 
lines, 
is 
introduced 
by 
a 
footnote 
that 
begins 
(and 
it 
continues 
in 
the 
same 
vein): 
“Tertullian 
gives 
here 
a 
colorful 
description 
of 
the 
millennium, 
picturing 
the 
feverish 
expectation 
of 
an 
early 
return 
of 
Christ 
…” 


It 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
the 
Protestant 
edition 
finds 
the 
work 
“so 
colourless,” 
while 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
edition 
considers 
it 
“colorful”— 
and 
neither 
of 
them 
evinces 
any 
sensitivity 
to 
what 
outraged 
Nietzsche 
or 
Gibbon.? 


Edward 
Gibbon’s 
comments 
are 
found 
in 
Chapter 
XV 
of 
The 
History 
of 
The 
Decline 
and 
Fall 
of 
the 
Roman 
Empire: 
“The 
condemnation 
of 
the 
wisest 
and 
most 
virtuous 
of 
the 
Pagans, 
on 
account 
of 
their 
ignorance 
or 
disbelief 
of 
the 
divine 
truth, 
seems 
to 
offend 
the 
reason 
and 
the 
humanity 
of 
the 
present 
age. 
But 
the 
primitive 
church, 
whose 
faith 



was 
of 
a 
much 
firmer 
consistence, 
delivered 
over, 
without 
hesitation, 
to 
eternal 
torture 
the 
far 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
human 
species.… 
These 
rigid 
sentiments, 
which 
had 
been 
unknown 
to 
the 
ancient 
world, 
appear 
to 
have 
infused 
a 
spirit 
of 
bitterness 
into 
a 
system 
of 
love 
and 
harmony.… 
The 
Christians, 
who, 
in 
this 
world, 
found 
themselves 
oppressed 
by 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Pagans, 
were 
sometimes 
seduced 
by 
resentment 
and 
spiritual 
pride 
to 
delight 
in 
the 
prospect 
of 
their 
future 
triumph. 
‘You 
are 
fond 
of 
spectacles,’ 
exclaims 
the 
stern 
Tertullian; 
‘except 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
spectacles, 
the 
last 
and 
eternal 
judgment 
of 
the 
universe. 
How 
shall 
I 
admire, 
how 
laugh 
…’ 
” 


1 
This 
remark 
which 
recalls 
Beyond 
‘Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
200, 
is 
entirely 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
contrast 
of 
master 
and 
slave 
morality 
is 
introduced 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
260; 
and 
it 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
overlooked. 
It 
sheds 
a 
good 
deal 
of 
light 
not 
only 
on 
this 
contrast 
but 
also 
on 
Nietzsche’s 
amor 
fati, 
his 
love 
of 
fate. 
Those 
who 
ignore 
all 
this 
material 
are 
bound 
completely 
to 
misunderstand 
Nietzsche’s 
moral 
philosophy.

Having 
said 
things 
that 
can 
easily 
be 
misconstrued 
as 
grist 
to 
the 
mill 
of 
the 
German 
anti-Semites, 
Nietzsche 
goes 
out 
of 
his 
way, 
as 
usual, 
to 
express 
his 
admiration 
for 
the 
Jews 
and 
his 
disdain 
for 
the 
Germans.

Second 
Essay 


“Guilt,” 
“Bad 
Conscience,”1 
and 
the 
Like 



1 


To 
breed 
an 
animal 
with 
the 
right 
to 
make 
promises—is 
not 
this 
the 
paradoxical 
task 
that 
nature 
has 
set 
itself 
in 
the 
case 
of 
man? 
is 
it 
not 
the 
real 
problem 
regarding 
man? 


That 
this 
problem 
has 
been 
solved 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
must 
seem 
all 
the 
more 
remarkable 
to 
anyone 
who 
appreciates 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
opposing 
force, 
that 
of 
forgetfulness. 
Forgetting 
is 
no 
mere 
vis 
inertiae2 
as 
the 
superficial 
imagine; 
it 
is 
rather 
an 
active 
and 
in 
the 
strictest 
sense 
positive 
faculty 
of 
repression,3 
that 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
we 
experience 
and 
absorb 
enters 
our 
consciousness 
as 
little 
while 
we 
are 
digesting 
it 
(one 
might 
call 
the 
process 
“inpsychation”) 
as 
does 
the 
thousandfold 
process, 
involved 
in 
physical 
nourishment—so-called 
“incorporation.” 
To 
close 
the 
doors 
and 
windows 
of 
consciousness 
for 
a 
time; 
to 
remain 
undisturbed 
by 
the 
noise 
and 
struggle 
of 
our 
underworld 
of 
utility 
organs 
working 
with 
and 
against 
one 
another; 
a 
little 
quietness, 
a 
little 
tabula 
rasa4 
of 
the 
consciousness, 
to 
make 
room 
for 
new 
things, 
above 
all 
for 
the 
nobler 
functions 
and 
functionaries, 
for 
regulation, 
foresight, 
premeditation 
(for 
our 
organism 
is 
an 
oligarchy)—that 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
active 
forgetfulness, 
which 
is 
like 
a 
doorkeeper, 
a 
preserver 
of 
psychic 
order, 
repose, 
and 
etiquette: 
so 
that 
it 
will 
be 
immediately 
obvious 
how 
there 
could 
be 
no 
happiness, 
no 
cheerfulness, 
no 
hope, 
no 
pride, 
no 
present, 
without 
forgetfulness. 
The 
man 
in 
whom 
this 
apparatus 
of 
repression 
is 
damaged 
and 
ceases 
to 
function 
properly 
may 
be 
compared 
(and 
more 
than 
merely 
compared) 
with 
a 
dyspeptic—he 
cannot 
“have 
done” 
with 
anything. 


Now 
this 
animal 
which 
needs 
to 
be 
forgetful, 
in 
which 
forgetting 
represents 
a 
force, 
a 
form 
of 
robust 
health, 
has 
bred 
in 
itself 
an 
opposing 
faculty, 
a 
memory, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
which 
forgetfulness 
is 
abrogated 
in 
certain 
cases—namely 
in 
those 
cases 
where 
promises 
are 
made. 
This 
involves 
no 
mere 
passive 
inability 
to 
rid 
oneself 
of 
an 
impression, 
no 
mere 
indigestion 
through 
a 
once-pledged 
word 
with 
which 
one 
cannot 
“have 
done,” 
but 
an 
active 
desire 
not 
to 
rid 
oneself, 
a 
desire 
for 
the 
continuance 
of 
something 
desired 
once, 
a 
real 
memory 
of 
the 
will: 
so 
that 
between 
the 
original 
“I 
will,” 
“I 
shall 
do 
this” 
and 
the 
actual 
discharge 
of 
the 
will, 
its 
act, 
a 
world 
of 



strange 
new 
things, 
circumstances, 
even 
acts 
of 
will 
may 
be 
interposed 
without 
breaking 
this 
long 
chain 
of 
will. 
But 
how 
many 
things 
this 
presupposes! 
To 
ordain 
the 
future 
in 
advance 
in 
this 
way, 
man 
must 
first 
have 
learned 
to 
distinguish 
necessary 
events 
from 
chance 
ones, 
to 
think 
causally, 
to 
see 
and 
anticipate 
distant 
eventualities 
as 
if 
they 
belonged 
to 
the 
present, 
to 
decide 
with 
certainty 
what 
is 
the 
goal 
and 
what 
the 
means 
to 
it, 
and 
in 
general 
be 
able 
to 
calculate 
and 
compute. 
Man 
himself 
must 
first 
of 
all 
have 
become 
calculable, 
regular, 
necessary, 
even 
in 
his 
own 
image 
of 
himself, 
if 
he 
is 
to 
be 
able 
to 
stand 
security 
for 
his 
own 
future, 
which 
is 
what 
one 
who 
promises 
does! 



2 


This 
precisely 
is 
the 
long 
story 
of 
how 
responsibility 
originated. 
The 
task 
of 
breeding 
an 
animal 
with 
the 
right 
to 
make 
promises 
evidently 
embraces 
and 
presupposes 
as 
a 
preparatory 
task 
that 
one 
first 
makes 
men 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
necessary, 
uniform, 
like 
among 
like, 
regular, 
and 
consequently 
calculable. 
The 
tremendous 
labor 
of 
that 
which 
I 
have 
called 
“morality 
of 
mores” 
(Dawn, 
sections 
9, 
14, 
16)1 


—the 
labor 
performed 
by 
man 
upon 
himself 
during 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
his 
entire 
prehistoric 
labor, 
finds 
in 
this 
its 
meaning, 
its 
great 
justification, 
notwithstanding 
the 
severity, 
tyranny, 
stupidity, 
and 
idiocy 
involved 
in 
it: 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
morality 
of 
mores 
and 
the 
social 
straitjacket, 
man 
was 
actually 
made 
calculable. 


If 
we 
place 
ourselves 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
tremendous 
process, 
where 
the 
tree 
at 
last 
brings 
forth 
fruit, 
where 
society 
and 
the 
morality 
of 
custom 
at 
last 
reveal 
what 
they 
have 
simply 
been 
the 
means 
to: 
then 
we 
discover 
that 
the 
ripest 
fruit 
is 
the 
sovereign 
individual, 
like 
only 
to 
himself, 
liberated 
again 
from 
morality 
of 
custom, 
autonomous 
and 
supramoral 
(for 
“autonomous” 
and 
“moral” 
are 
mutually 
exclusive),2 
in 
short, 
the 
man 
who 
has 
his 
own 
independent, 
protracted 
will 
and 
the 
right 
to 
make 
promises—and 
in 
him 
a 
proud 
consciousness, 
quivering 
in 
every 
muscle, 
of 
what 
has 
at 
length 
been 
achieved 
and 
become 
flesh 
in 
him, 
a 
consciousness 
of 
his 
own 
power 
and 
freedom, 
a 
sensation 
of 
mankind 
come 
to 
completion. 
This 
emancipated 
individual, 
with 
the 
actual 
right 
to 
make 
promises, 
this 
master 
of 
a 
free 
will, 
this 
sovereign 
man—how 
should 
he 
not 
be 
aware 
of 
his 
superiority 
over 
all 
those 
who 
lack 
the 
right 
to 
make 
promises 
and 
stand 
as 
their 
own 
guarantors, 
of 
how 
much 
trust, 
how 
much 
fear, 
how 
much 
reverence 
he 
arouses—he 
“deserves” 
all 
three—and 
of 
how 
this 
mastery 
over 
himself 
also 
necessarily 
gives 
him 
mastery 
over 
circumstances, 
over 
nature, 
and 
over 
all 
more 
short-
willed 
and 
unreliable 
creatures? 
The 
“free” 
man, 
the 
possessor 
of 
a 
protracted 
and 
unbreakable 
will, 
also 
possesses 
his 
measure 
of 
value: 
looking 
out 
upon 
others 
from 
himself, 
he 
honors 
or 
he 
despises; 
and 
just 
as 
he 
is 
bound 
to 
honor 
his 
peers, 
the 
strong 
and 
reliable 
(those 
with 
the 
right 
to 
make 



promises)—that 
is, 
all 
those 
who 
promise 
like 
sovereigns, 
reluctantly, 
rarely, 
slowly, 
who 
are 
chary 
of 
trusting, 
whose 
trust 
is 
a 
mark 
of 
distinction, 
who 
give 
their 
word 
as 
something 
that 
can 
be 
relied 
on 
because 
they 
know 
themselves 
strong 
enough 
to 
maintain 
it 
in 
the 
face 
of 
accidents, 
even 
“in 
the 
face 
of 
fate”—he 
is 
bound 
to 
reserve 
a 
kick 
for 
the 
feeble 
windbags 
who 
promise 
without 
the 
right 
to 
do 
so, 
and 
a 
rod 
for 
the 
liar 
who 
breaks 
his 
word 
even 
at 
the 
moment 
he 
utters 
it. 
The 
proud 
awareness 
of 
the 
extraordinary 
privilege 
of 
responsibility, 
the 
consciousness 
of 
this 
rare 
freedom, 
this 
power 
over 
oneself 
and 
over 
fate, 
has 
in 
his 
case 
penetrated 
to 
the 
profoundest 
depths 
and 
become 
instinct, 
the 
dominating 
instinct. 
What 
will 
he 
call 
this 
dominating 
instinct, 
supposing 
he 
feels 
the 
need 
to 
give 
it 
a 
name? 
The 
answer 
is 
beyond 
doubt: 
this 
sovereign 
man 
calls 
it 
his 
conscience. 



3 


His 
conscience?— 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
guess 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
“conscience” 
that 
we 
here 
encounter 
in 
its 
highest, 
almost 
astonishing, 
manifestation, 
has 
a 
long 
history 
and 
variety 
of 
forms 
behind 
it. 
To 
possess 
the 
right 
to 
stand 
security 
for 
oneself 
and 
to 
do 
so 
with 
pride, 
thus 
to 
possess 
also 
the 
right 
to 
affirm 
oneself—this, 
as 
has 
been 
said, 
is 
a 
ripe 
fruit, 
but 
also 
a 
late 
fruit: 
how 
long 
must 
this 
fruit 
have 
hung 
on 
the 
tree, 
unripe 
and 
sour! 
And 
for 
a 
much 
longer 
time 
nothing 
whatever 
was 
to 
be 
seen 
of 
any 
such 
fruit: 
no 
one 
could 
have 
promised 
its 
appearance, 
although 
everything 
in 
the 
tree 
was 
preparing 
for 
and 
growing 
toward 
it! 


“How 
can 
one 
create 
a 
memory 
for 
the 
human 
animal? 
How 
can 
one 
impress 
something 
upon 
this 
partly 
obtuse, 
partly 
flighty 
mind, 
attuned 
only 
to 
the 
passing 
moment, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
will 
stay 
there?” 


One 
can 
well 
believe 
that 
the 
answers 
and 
methods 
for 
solving 
this 
primeval 
problem 
were 
not 
precisely 
gentle; 
perhaps 
indeed 
there 
was 
nothing 
more 
fearful 
and 
uncanny 
in 
the 
whole 
prehistory 
of 
man 
than 
his 
mnemotechnics. 
“If 
something 
is 
to 
stay 
in 
the 
memory 
it 
must 
be 
burned 
in: 
only 
that 
which 
never 
ceases 
to 
hurt 
stays 
in 
the 
memory”—this 
is 
a 
main 
clause 
of 
the 
oldest 
(unhappily 
also 
the 
most 
enduring) 
psychology 
on 
earth. 
One 
might 
even 
say 
that 
wherever 
on 
earth 
solemnity, 
seriousness, 
mystery, 
and 
gloomy 
coloring 
still 
distinguish 
the 
life 
of 
man 
and 
a 
people, 
something 
of 
the 
terror 
that 
formerly 
attended 
all 
promises, 
pledges, 
and 
vows 
on 
earth 
is 
still 
effective: 
the 
past, 
the 
longest, 
deepest 
and 
sternest 
past, 
breathes 
upon 
us 
and 
rises 
up 
in 
us 
whenever 
we 
become 
“serious.” 
Man 
could 
never 
do 
without 
blood, 
torture, 
and 
sacrifices 
when 
he 
felt 
the 
need 
to 
create 
a 
memory 
for 
himself; 
the 
most 
dreadful 
sacrifices 
and 
pledges 
(sacrifices 
of 
the 
first-born 
among 
them), 
the 
most 
repulsive 
mutilations 
(castration, 
for 
example), 
the 
cruelest 
rites 
of 
all 
the 
religious 
cults 
(and 
all 
religions 
are 
at 
the 
deepest 
level 
systems 
of 
cruelties)—all 
this 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
instinct 
that 
realized 
that 
pain 
is 
the 
most 
powerful 
aid 
to 
mnemonics. 


In 
a 
certain 
sense, 
the 
whole 
of 
asceticism 
belongs 
here: 
a 
few 
ideas 
are 
to 
be 
rendered 
inextinguishable, 
ever-present, 
unforgetable, 
“fixed,” 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
hypnotising 
the 
entire 
nervous 
and 
intellectual 
system 
with 
these 



“fixed 
ideas”—and 
ascetic 
procedures 
and 
modes 
of 
life 
are 
means 
of 
freeing 
these 
ideas 
from 
the 
competition 
of 
all 
other 
ideas, 
so 
as 
to 
make 
them 
“unforgettable.” 
The 
worse 
man’s 
memory 
has 
been, 
the 
more 
fearful 
has 
been 
the 
appearance 
of 
his 
customs; 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
penal 
code 
provides 
an 
especially 
significant 
measure 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
effort 
needed 
to 
overcome 
forgetfulness 
and 
to 
impose 
a 
few 
primitive 
demands 
of 
social 
existence 
as 
present 
realities 
upon 
these 
slaves 
of 
momentary 
affect 
and 
desire. 


We 
Germans 
certainly 
do 
not 
regard 
ourselves 
as 
a 
particularly 
cruel 
and 
hardhearted 
people, 
still 
less 
as 
a 
particularly 
frivolous 
one, 
living 
only 
for 
the 
day; 
but 
one 
has 
only 
to 
look 
at 
our 
former 
codes 
of 
punishments 
to 
understand 
what 
effort 
it 
costs 
on 
this 
earth 
to 
breed 
a 
“nation 
of 
thinkers” 
(which 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
nation 
in 
Europe 
in 
which 
one 
still 
finds 
today 
the 
maximum 
of 
trust, 
seriousness, 
lack 
of 
taste, 
and 
matter-of-factness—and 
with 
these 
qualities 
one 
has 
the 
right 
to 
breed 
every 
kind 
of 
European 
mandarin). 
These 
Germans 
have 
employed 
fearful 
means 
to 
acquire 
a 
memory, 
so 
as 
to 
master 
their 
basic 
mob-instinct 
and 
its 
brutal 
coarseness. 
Consider 
the 
old 
German 
punishments; 
for 
example, 
stoning 
(the 
sagas 
already 
have 
millstones 
drop 
on 
the 
head 
of 
the 
guilty), 
breaking 
on 
the 
wheel 
(the 
most 
characteristic 
invention 
and 
speciality 
of 
the 
German 
genius 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
punishment!), 
piercing 
with 
stakes, 
tearing 
apart 
or 
trampling 
by 
horses 
(“quartering”), 
boiling 
of 
the 
criminal 
in 
oil 
or 
wine 
(still 
employed 
in 
the 
fourteenth 
and 
fifteenth 
centuries), 
the 
popular 
flaying 
alive 
(“cutting 
straps”), 
cutting 
flesh 
from 
the 
chest, 
and 
also 
the 
practice 
of 
smearing 
the 
wrongdoer 
with 
honey 
and 
leaving 
him 
in 
the 
blazing 
sun 
for 
the 
flies. 
With 
the 
aid 
of 
such 
images 
and 
procedures 
one 
finally 
remembers 
five 
or 
six 
“I 
will 
not’s,” 
in 
regard 
to 
which 
one 
had 
given 
one’s 
promise 
so 
as 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
advantages 
of 
society—and 
it 
was 
indeed 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
memory 
that 
one 
at 
last 
came 
“to 
reason”! 
Ah, 
reason, 
seriousness, 
mastery 
over 
the 
affects, 
the 
whole 
somber 
thing 
called 
reflection, 
all 
these 
prerogatives 
and 
showpieces 
of 
man: 
how 
dearly 
they 
have 
been 
bought! 
how 
much 
blood 
and 
cruelty 
lie 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
all 
“good 
things”! 



4 


But 
how 
did 
that 
other 
“somber 
thing,” 
the 
consciousness 
of 
guilt, 
the 
“bad 
conscience,” 
come 
into 
the 
world?— 
And 
at 
this 
point 
we 
return 
to 
the 
genealogists 
of 
morals. 
To 
say 
it 
again—or 
haven’t 
I 
said 
it 
yet?—they 
are 
worthless. 
A 
brief 
span 
of 
experience 
that 
is 
merely 
one’s 
own, 
merely 
modern; 
no 
knowledge 
or 
will 
to 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past; 
even 
less 
of 
historical 
instinct, 
of 
that 
“second 
sight” 
needed 
here 
above 
all—and 
yet 
they 
undertake 
history 
of 
morality: 
it 
stands 
to 
reason 
that 
their 
results 
stay 
at 
a 
more 
than 
respectful 
distance 
from 
the 
truth. 
Have 
these 
genealogists 
of 
morals 
had 
even 
the 
remotest 
suspicion 
that, 
for 
example, 
the 
major 
moral 
concept 
Schuld 
[guilt] 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
very 
material 
concept 
Schulden 
[debts]?1 


Or 
that 
punishment, 
as 
requital, 
evolved 
quite 
independently 
of 
any 
presupposition 
concerning 
freedom 
or 
non-freedom 
of 
the 
will?—to 
such 
an 
extent, 
indeed, 
that 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
humanity 
had 
to 
be 
attained 
before 
the 
animal 
“man” 
began 
even 
to 
make 
the 
much 
more 
primitive 
distinctions 
between 
“intentional,” 
“negligent,” 
“accidental,” 
“accountable,” 
and 
their 
opposites 
and 
to 
take 
them 
into 
account 
when 
determining 
punishments. 
The 
idea, 
now 
so 
obvious, 
apparently 
so 
natural, 
even 
unavoidable, 
that 
had 
to 
serve 
as 
the 
explanation 
of 
how 
the 
sense 
of 
justice 
ever 
appeared 
on 
earth 
—“the 
criminal 
deserves 
punishment 
because 
he 
could 
have 
acted 
differently”—is 
in 
fact 
an 
extremely 
late 
and 
subtle 
form 
of 
human 
judgment 
and 
inference: 
whoever 
transposes 
it 
to 
the 
beginning 
is 
guilty 
of 
a 
crude 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
more 
primitive 
mankind. 
Throughout 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
human 
history 
punishment 
was 
not 
imposed 
because 
one 
held 
the 
wrongdoer 
responsible 
for 
his 
deed, 
thus 
not 
on 
the 
presupposition 
that 
only 
the 
guilty 
one 
should 
be 
punished: 
rather, 
as 
parents 
still 
punish 
their 
children, 
from 
anger 
at 
some 
harm 
or 
injury, 
vented 
on 
the 
one 
who 
caused 
it—but 
this 
anger 
is 
held 
in 
check 
and 
modified 
by 
the 
idea 
that 
every 
injury 
has 
its 
equivalent 
and 
can 
actually 
be 
paid 
back, 
even 
if 
only 
through 
the 
pain 
of 
the 
culprit. 
And 
whence 
did 
this 
primeval, 
deeply 
rooted, 
perhaps 
by 
now 
ineradicable 
idea 
draw 
its 
power—this 
idea 
of 
an 
equivalence 



between 
injury 
and 
pain? 
I 
have 
already 
divulged 
it: 
in 
the 
contractual 
relationship 
between 
creditor 
and 
debtor, 
which 
is 
as 
old 
as 
the 
idea 
of 
“legal 
subjects” 
and 
in 
turn 
points 
back 
to 
the 
fundamental 
forms 
of 
buying, 
selling, 
barter, 
trade, 
and 
traffic. 



5 


When 
we 
contemplate 
these 
contractual 
relationships, 
to 
be 
sure, 
we 
feel 
considerable 
suspicion 
and 
repugnance 
toward 
those 
men 
of 
the 
past 
who 
created 
or 
permitted 
them. 
This 
was 
to 
be 
expected 
from 
what 
we 
have 
previously 
noted. 
It 
was 
here 
that 
promises 
were 
made; 
it 
was 
here 
that 
a 
memory 
had 
to 
be 
made 
for 
those 
who 
promised; 
it 
is 
here, 
one 
suspects, 
that 
we 
shall 
find 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
severity, 
cruelty, 
and 
pain. 
To 
inspire 
trust 
in 
his 
promise 
to 
repay, 
to 
provide 
a 
guarantee 
of 
the 
seriousness 
and 
sanctity 
of 
his 
promise, 
to 
impress 
repayment 
as 
a 
duty, 
an 
obligation 
upon 
his 
own 
conscience, 
the 
debtor 
made 
a 
contract 
with 
the 
creditor 
and 
pledged 
that 
if 
he 
should 
fail 
to 
repay 
he 
would 
substitute 
something 
else 
that 
he 
“possessed,” 
something 
he 
had 
control 
over; 
for 
example, 
his 
body, 
his 
wife, 
his 
freedom, 
or 
even 
his 
life 
(or, 
given 
certain 
religious 
presuppositions, 
even 
his 
bliss 
after 
death, 
the 
salvation 
of 
his 
soul, 
ultimately 
his 
peace 
in 
the 
grave: 
thus 
it 
was 
in 
Egypt, 
where 
the 
debtor’s 
corpse 
found 
no 
peace 
from 
the 
creditor 
even 
in 
the 
grave—and 
among 
the 
Egyptians 
such 
peace 
meant 
a 
great 
deal). 
Above 
all, 
however, 
the 
creditor 
could 
inflict 
every 
kind 
of 
indignity 
and 
torture 
upon 
the 
body 
of 
the 
debtor; 
for 
example, 
cut 
from 
it 
as 
much 
as 
seemed 
commensurate 
with 
the 
size 
of 
the 
debt—and 
everywhere 
and 
from 
early 
times 
one 
had 
exact 
evaluations, 
legal 
evaluations, 
of 
the 
individual 
limbs 
and 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
some 
of 
them 
going 
into 
horrible 
and 
minute 
detail. 
I 
consider 
it 
as 
an 
advance, 
as 
evidence 
of 
a 
freer, 
more 
generous, 
more 
Roman 
conception 
of 
law 
when 
the 
Twelve 
Tables 
of 
Rome 
decreed 
it 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
how 
much 
or 
how 
little 
the 
creditor 
cut 
off 
in 
such 
cases: 
“si 
plus 
minusve 
secuerunt, 
ne 
fraude 
esto.”1 


Let 
us 
be 
clear 
as 
to 
the 
logic 
of 
this 
form 
of 
compensation: 
it 
is 
strange 
enough. 
An 
equivalence 
is 
provided 
by 
the 
creditor’s 
receiving, 
in 
place 
of 
a 
literal 
compensation 
for 
an 
injury 
(thus 
in 
place 
of 
money, 
land, 
possessions 
of 
any 
kind), 
a 
recompense 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
kind 
of 
pleasure—the 
pleasure 
of 
being 
allowed 
to 
vent 
his 
power 
freely 
upon 
one 
who 
is 
powerless, 
the 
voluptuous 
pleasure 
“de 
faire 
le 
mal 
pour 
le 
plaisir 
de 
le 
faire,”2 
the 



enjoyment 
of 
violation. 
This 
enjoyment 
will 
be 
the 
greater 
the 
lower 
the 
creditor 
stands 
in 
the 
social 
order, 
and 
can 
easily 
appear 
to 
him 
as 
a 
most 
delicious 
morsel, 
indeed 
as 
a 
foretaste 
of 
higher 
rank. 
In 
“punishing” 
the 
debtor, 
the 
creditor 
participates 
in 
a 
right 
of 
the 
masters: 
at 
last 
he, 
too, 
may 
experience 
for 
once 
the 
exalted 
sensation 
of 
being 
allowed 
to 
despise 
and 
mistreat 
someone 
as 
“beneath 
him”— 
or 
at 
least, 
if 
the 
actual 
power 
and 
administration 
of 
punishment 
has 
already 
passed 
to 
the 
“authorities,” 
to 
see 
him 
despised 
and 
mistreated. 
The 
compensation, 
then, 
consists 
in 
a 
warrant 
for 
and 
title 
to 
cruelty.— 



6 


It 
was 
in 
this 
sphere 
then, 
the 
sphere 
of 
legal 
obligations, 
that 
the 
moral 
conceptual 
world 
of 
“guilt,” 
“conscience,” 
“duty,” 
“sacredness 
of 
duty” 
had 
its 
origin: 
its 
beginnings 
were, 
like 
the 
beginnings 
of 
everything 
great 
on 
earth, 
soaked 
in 
blood 
thoroughly 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
And 
might 
one 
not 
add 
that, 
fundamentally, 
this 
world 
has 
never 
since 
lost 
a 
certain 
odor 
of 
blood 
and 
torture? 
(Not 
even 
in 
good 
old 
Kant: 
the 
categorical 
imperative 
smells 
of 
cruelty.) 
It 
was 
here, 
too, 
that 
that 
uncanny 
intertwining 
of 
the 
ideas 
“guilt 
and 
suffering” 
was 
first 
effected—and 
by 
now 
they 
may 
well 
be 
inseparable. 
To 
ask 
it 
again: 
to 
what 
extent 
can 
suffering 
balance 
debts 
or 
guilt?3 


To 
the 
extent 
that 
to 
make 
suffer 
was 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
pleasurable, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
injured 
party 
exchanged 
for 
the 
loss 
he 
had 
sustained, 
including 
the 
displeasure 
caused 
by 
the 
loss, 
an 
extraordinary 
counterbalancing 
pleasure: 
that 
of 
making 
suffer—a 
genuine 
festival, 
something 
which, 
as 
aforesaid, 
was 
prized 
the 
more 
highly 
the 
more 
violently 
it 
contrasted 
with 
the 
rank 
and 
social 
standing 
of 
the 
creditor. 
This 
is 
offered 
only 
as 
a 
conjecture; 
for 
the 
depths 
of 
such 
subterranean 
things 
are 
difficult 
to 
fathom, 
besides 
being 
painful; 
and 
whoever 
clumsily 
interposes 
the 
concept 
of 
“revenge” 
does 
not 
enhance 
his 
insight 
into 
the 
matter 
but 
further 
veils 
and 
darkens 
it 
(—for 
revenge 
merely 
leads 
us 
back 
to 
the 
same 
problem: 
“how 
can 
making 
suffer 
constitute 
a 
compensation?”). 


It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
delicacy 
and 
even 
more 
the 
tartuffery 
of 
tame 
domestic 
animals 
(which 
is 
to 
say 
modern 
men, 
which 
is 
to 
say 
us) 
resists 
a 
really 
vivid 
comprehension 
of 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
cruelty 
constituted 
the 
great 
festival 
pleasure 
of 
more 
primitive 
men 
and 
was 
indeed 
an 
ingredient 
of 
almost 
every 
one 
of 
their 
pleasures; 
and 
how 
naively, 
how 
innocently 
their 
thirst 
for 
cruelty 
manifested 
itself, 
how, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle, 
they 
posited 
“disinterested 
malice” 
(or, 
in 
Spinoza’s 
words, 
sympathia 
malevolens) 
as 
a 
normal 
quality 
of 
man—and 
thus 
as 
something 
to 
which 
the 
conscience 
cordially 
says 
Yes! 
A 
more 
profound 
eye 
might 
perceive 
enough 
of 
this 
oldest 
and 
most 
fundamental 
festival 
pleasure 
of 
man 
even 
in 
our 
time; 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
2294 
(and 
earlier 
in 
The 
Dawn, 
sections 
18, 
77, 
113)5 



I 
pointed 
cautiously 
to 
the 
ever-increasing 
spiritualization 
and 
“deification” 
of 
cruelty 
which 
permeates 
the 
entire 
history 
of 
higher 
culture 
(and 
in 
a 
significant 
sense 
actually 
constitutes 
it). 
In 
any 
event, 
it 
is 
not 
long 
since 
princely 
weddings 
and 
public 
festivals 
of 
the 
more 
magnificent 
kind 
were 
unthinkable 
without 
executions, 
torturings, 
or 
perhaps 
an 
auto-da-fé, 
and 
no 
noble 
household 
was 
without 
creatures 
upon 
whom 
one 
could 
heedlessly 
vent 
one’s 
malice 
and 
cruel 
jokes. 
(Consider, 
for 
instance, 
Don 
Quixote 
at 
the 
court 
of 
the 
Duchess. 
Today 
we 
read 
Don 
Quixote 
with 
a 
bitter 
taste 
in 
our 
mouths, 
almost 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
torment, 
and 
would 
thus 
seem 
very 
strange 
and 
incomprehensible 
to 
its 
author 
and 
his 
contemporaries: 
they 
read 
it 
with 
the 
clearest 
conscience 
in 
the 
world 
as 
the 
most 
cheerful 
of 
books, 
they 
laughed 
themselves 
almost 
to 
death 
over 
it). 
To 
see 
others 
suffer 
does 
one 
good, 
to 
make 
others 
suffer 
even 
more: 
this 
is 
a 
hard 
saying 
but 
an 
ancient, 
mighty, 
human, 
all-too-human 
principle 
to 
which 
even 
the 
apes 
might 
subscribe; 
for 
it 
has 
been 
said 
that 
in 
devising 
bizarre 
cruelties 
they 
anticipate 
man 
and 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
his 
“prelude.” 
Without 
cruelty 
there 
is 
no 
festival: 
thus 
the 
longest 
and 
most 
ancient 
part 
of 
human 
history 
teaches—and 
in 
punishment 
there 
is 
so 
much 
that 
is 
festive!— 



7 


With 
this 
idea, 
by 
the 
way, 
I 
am 
by 
no 
means 
concerned 
to 
furnish 
our 
pessimists 
with 
more 
grist 
for 
their 
discordant 
and 
creaking 
mills 
of 
life-
satiety. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
let 
me 
declare 
expressly 
that 
in 
the 
days 
when 
mankind 
was 
not 
yet 
ashamed 
of 
its 
cruelty, 
life 
on 
earth 
was 
more 
cheerful 
than 
it 
is 
now 
that 
pessimists 
exist. 
The 
darkening 
of 
the 
sky 
above 
mankind 
has 
deepened 
in 
step 
with 
the 
increase 
in 
man’s 
feeling 
of 
shame 
at 
man. 
The 
weary 
pessimistic 
glance, 
mistrust 
of 
the 
riddle 
of 
life, 
the 
icy 
No 
of 
disgust 
with 
life—these 
do 
not 
characterize 
the 
most 
evil 
epochs 
of 
the 
human 
race: 
rather 
do 
they 
first 
step 
into 
the 
light 
of 
day 
as 
the 
swamp 
weeds 
they 
are 
when 
the 
swamp 
to 
which 
they 
belong 
comes 
into 
being—I 
mean 
the 
morbid 
softening 
and 
moralization 
through 
which 
the 
animal 
“man” 
finally 
learns 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of 
all 
his 
instincts. 
On 
his 
way 
to 
becoming 
an 
“angel” 
(to 
employ 
no 
uglier 
word) 
man 
has 
evolved 
that 
queasy 
stomach 
and 
coated 
tongue 
through 
which 
not 
only 
the 
joy 
and 
innocence 
of 
the 
animal 
but 
life 
itself 
has 
become 
repugnant 
to 
him—so 
that 
he 
sometimes 
holds 
his 
nose 
in 
his 
own 
presence 
and, 
with 
Pope 
Innocent 
the 
Third, 
disapprovingly 
catalogues 
his 
own 
repellent 
aspects 
(“impure 
begetting, 
disgusting 
means 
of 
nutrition 
in 
his 
mother’s 
womb, 
baseness 
of 
the 
matter 
out 
of 
which 
man 
evolves, 
hideous 
stink, 
secretion 
of 
saliva, 
urine, 
and 
filth”). 


Today, 
when 
suffering 
is 
always 
brought 
forward 
as 
the 
principal 
argument 
against 
existence, 
as 
the 
worst 
question 
mark, 
one 
does 
well 
to 
recall 
the 
ages 
in 
which 
the 
opposite 
opinion 
prevailed 
because 
men 
were 
unwilling 
to 
refrain 
from 
making 
suffer 
and 
saw 
in 
it 
an 
enchantment 
of 
the 
first 
order, 
a 
genuine 
seduction 
to 
life. 
Perhaps 
in 
those 
days—the 
delicate 
may 
be 
comforted 
by 
this 
thought—pain 
did 
not 
hurt 
as 
much 
as 
it 
does 
now; 
at 
least 
that 
is 
the 
conclusion 
a 
doctor 
may 
arrive 
at 
who 
has 
treated 
Negroes 
(taken 
as 
representatives 
of 
prehistoric 
man—) 
for 
severe 
internal 
inflammations 
that 
would 
drive 
even 
the 
best 
constituted 
European 
to 
distraction—in 
the 
case 
of 
Negroes 
they 
do 
not 
do 
so. 
(The 
curve 
of 
human 
susceptibility 
to 
pain 
seems 
in 
fact 
to 
take 
an 
extraordinary 
and 
almost 
sudden 
drop 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
has 
passed 
the 
upper 
ten 
thousand 
or 
ten 
million 
of 
the 
top 
stratum 
of 
culture; 
and 
for 
my 
own 
part, 
I 
have 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
combined 
suffering 
of 
all 
the 



animals 
ever 
subjected 
to 
the 
knife 
for 
scientific 
ends 
is 
utterly 
negligible 
compared 
with 
one 
painful 
night 
of 
a 
single 
hysterical 
bluestocking.) 
Perhaps 
the 
possibility 
may 
even 
be 
allowed 
that 
this 
joy 
in 
cruelty 
does 
not 
really 
have 
to 
have 
died 
out: 
if 
pain 
hurts 
more 
today, 
it 
simply 
requires 
a 
certain 
sublimation 
and 
subtilization, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
it 
has 
to 
appear 
translated 
into 
the 
imaginative 
and 
psychical 
and 
adorned 
with 
such 
innocent 
names 
that 
even 
the 
tenderest 
and 
most 
hypocritical 
conscience 
is 
not 
suspicious 
of 
them 
(“tragic 
pity” 
is 
one 
such 
name; 
“les 
nostalgies 
de 
la 
croix”6 
is 
another). 


What 
really 
arouses 
indignation 
against 
suffering 
is 
not 
suffering 
as 
such 
but 
the 
senselessness 
of 
suffering: 
but 
neither 
for 
the 
Christian, 
who 
has 
interpreted 
a 
whole 
mysterious 
machinery 
of 
salvation 
into 
suffering, 
nor 
for 
the 
naïve 
man 
of 
more 
ancient 
times, 
who 
understood 
all 
suffering 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
spectator 
of 
it 
or 
the 
causer 
of 
it, 
was 
there 
any 
such 
thing 
as 
senseless 
suffering. 
So 
as 
to 
abolish 
hidden, 
undetected, 
unwitnessed 
suffering 
from 
the 
world 
and 
honestly 
to 
deny 
it, 
one 
was 
in 
the 
past 
virtually 
compelled 
to 
invent 
gods 
and 
genii 
of 
all 
the 
heights 
and 
depths, 
in 
short 
something 
that 
roams 
even 
in 
secret, 
hidden 
places, 
sees 
even 
in 
the 
dark, 
and 
will 
not 
easily 
let 
an 
interesting 
painful 
spectacle 
pass 
unnoticed. 
For 
it 
was 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
such 
inventions 
that 
life 
then 
knew 
how 
to 
work 
the 
trick 
which 
it 
has 
always 
known 
how 
to 
work, 
that 
of 
justifying 
itself, 
of 
justifying 
its 
“evil.” 
Nowadays 
it 
might 
require 
other 
auxiliary 
inventions 
(for 
example, 
life 
as 
a 
riddle, 
life 
as 
an 
epistemological 
problem). 
“Every 
evil 
the 
sight 
of 
which 
edifies 
a 
god 
is 
justified”: 
thus 
spoke 
the 
primitive 
logic 
of 
feeling—and 
was 
it, 
indeed, 
only 
primitive? 
The 
gods 
conceived 
of 
as 
the 
friends 
of 
cruel 
spectacles—oh 
how 
profoundly 
this 
ancient 
idea 
still 
permeates 
our 
European 
humanity! 
Merely 
consult 
Calvin 
and 
Luther. 
It 
is 
certain, 
at 
any 
rate, 
that 
the 
Greeks 
still 
knew 
of 
no 
tastier 
spice 
to 
offer 
their 
gods 
to 
season 
their 
happiness 
than 
the 
pleasures 
of 
cruelty. 
With 
what 
eyes 
do 
you 
think 
Homer 
made 
his 
gods 
look 
down 
upon 
the 
destinies 
of 
men? 
What 
was 
at 
bottom 
the 
ultimate 
meaning 
of 
Trojan 
Wars 
and 
other 
such 
tragic 
terrors? 
There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
whatever: 
they 
were 
intended 
as 
festival 
plays 
for 
the 
gods; 
and, 
insofar 
as 
the 
poet 
is 
in 
these 
matters 
of 
a 
more 
“godlike” 
disposition 
than 
other 
men, 
no 
doubt 
also 
as 
festival 
plays 
for 
the 
poets. 


It 
was 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
moral 
philosophers 
of 
Greece 
later 
imagined 
the 
eyes 
of 
God 
looking 
down 
upon 
the 
moral 
struggle, 
upon 
the 
heroism 
and 
self-torture 
of 
the 
virtuous: 
the 
“Herakles 
of 
duty” 
was 
on 
a 
stage 
and 
knew 
himself 
to 
be; 
virtue 
without 
a 
witness 
was 
something 



unthinkable 
for 
this 
nation 
of 
actors. 
Surely, 
that 
philosophers’ 
invention, 
so 
bold 
and 
so 
fateful, 
which 
was 
then 
first 
devised 
for 
Europe, 
the 
invention 
of 
“free 
will,” 
of 
the 
absolute 
spontaneity 
of 
man 
in 
good 
and 
in 
evil, 
was 
devised 
above 
all 
to 
furnish 
a 
right 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
gods 
in 
man, 
in 
human 
virtue, 
could 
never 
be 
exhausted. 
There 
must 
never 
be 
any 
lack 
of 
real 
novelty, 
of 
really 
unprecedented 
tensions, 
complications, 
and 
catastrophies 
on 
the 
stage 
of 
the 
earth: 
the 
course 
of 
a 
completely 
deterministic 
world 
would 
have 
been 
predictable 
for 
the 
gods 
and 
they 
would 
have 
quickly 
grown 
weary 
of 
it—reason 
enough 
for 
those 
friends 
of 
the 
gods, 
the 
philosophers, 
not 
to 
inflict 
such 
a 
deterministic 
world 
on 
their 
gods! 
The 
entire 
mankind 
of 
antiquity 
is 
full 
of 
tender 
regard 
for 
“the 
spectator,” 
as 
an 
essentially 
public, 
essentially 
visible 
world 
which 
cannot 
imagine 
happiness 
apart 
from 
spectacles 
and 
festivals.— 
And, 
as 
aforesaid, 
even 
in 
great 
punishment 
there 
is 
so 
much 
that 
is 
festive! 



8 


To 
return 
to 
our 
investigation: 
the 
feeling 
of 
guilt, 
of 
personal 
obligation, 
had 
its 
origin, 
as 
we 
saw, 
in 
the 
oldest 
and 
most 
primitive 
personal 
relationship, 
that 
between 
buyer 
and 
seller, 
creditor 
and 
debtor: 
it 
was 
here 
that 
one 
person 
first 
encountered 
another 
person, 
that 
one 
person 
first 
measured 
himself 
against 
another. 
No 
grade 
of 
civilization, 
however 
low, 
has 
yet 
been 
discovered 
in 
which 
something 
of 
this 
relationship 
has 
not 
been 
noticeable. 
Setting 
prices, 
determining 
values, 
contriving 
equivalences, 
exchanging—these 
preoccupied 
the 
earliest 
thinking 
of 
man 
to 
so 
great 
an 
extent 
that 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
they 
constitute 
thinking 
as 
such: 
here 
it 
was 
that 
the 
oldest 
kind 
of 
astuteness 
developed; 
here 
likewise, 
we 
may 
suppose, 
did 
human 
pride, 
the 
feeling 
of 
superiority 
in 
relation 
to 
other 
animals, 
have 
its 
first 
beginnings. 
Perhaps 
our 
word 
“man” 
(manas) 
still 
expresses 
something 
of 
precisely 
this 
feeling 
of 
self-satisfaction: 
man 
designated 
himself 
as 
the 
creature 
that 
measures 
values, 
evaluates 
and 
measures, 
as 
the 
“valuating 
animal 
as 
such.” 


Buying 
and 
selling, 
together 
with 
their 
psychological 
appurtenances, 
are 
older 
even 
than 
the 
beginnings 
of 
any 
kind 
of 
social 
forms 
of 
organization 
and 
alliances: 
it 
was 
rather 
out 
of 
the 
most 
rudimentary 
form 
of 
personal 
legal 
rights 
that 
the 
budding 
sense 
of 
exchange, 
contract, 
guilt, 
right, 
obligation, 
settlement, 
first 
transferred 
itself 
to 
the 
coarsest 
and 
most 
elementary 
social 
complexes 
(in 
their 
relations 
with 
other 
similar 
complexes), 
together 
with 
the 
custom 
of 
comparing, 
measuring, 
and 
calculating 
power 
against 
power. 
The 
eye 
was 
now 
focused 
on 
this 
perspective; 
and 
with 
that 
blunt 
consistency 
characteristic 
of 
the 
thinking 
of 
primitive 
mankind, 
which 
is 
hard 
to 
set 
in 
motion 
but 
then 
proceeds 
inexorably 
in 
the 
same 
direction, 
one 
forthwith 
arrived 
at 
the 
great 
generalization, 
“everything 
has 
its 
price; 
all 
things 
can 
be 
paid 
for”—the 
oldest 
and 
naïvest 
moral 
canon 
of 
justice, 
the 
beginning 
of 
all 
“good-naturedness,” 
all 
“fairness,” 
all 
“good 
will,” 
all 
“objectivity” 
on 
earth. 
Justice 
on 
this 
elementary 
level 
is 
the 
good 
will 
among 
parties 
of 
approximately 
equal 
power 
to 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
one 
another, 
to 
reach 
an 
“understanding” 
by 
means 
of 
a 
settlement—and 
to 
compel 
parties 
of 
lesser 
power 
to 
reach 
a 
settlement 
among 
themselves.— 



9 


Still 
retaining 
the 
criteria 
of 
prehistory 
(this 
prehistory 
is 
in 
any 
case 
present 
in 
all 
ages 
or 
may 
always 
reappear)1 


: 
the 
community, 
too, 
stands 
to 
its 
members 
in 
that 
same 
vital 
basic 
relation, 
that 
of 
the 
creditor 
to 
his 
debtors. 
One 
lives 
in 
a 
community, 
one 
enjoys 
the 
advantages 
of 
a 
communality 
(oh 
what 
advantages! 
we 
sometimes 
underrate 
them 
today), 
one 
dwells 
protected, 
cared 
for, 
in 
peace 
and 
trustfulness, 
without 
fear 
of 
certain 
injuries 
and 
hostile 
acts 
to 
which 
the 
man 
outside, 
the 
“man 
without 
peace,” 
is 
exposed—a 
German 
will 
understand 
the 
original 
connotations 
of 
Elend2 


—since 
one 
has 
bound 
and 
pledged 
oneself 
to 
the 
community 
precisely 
with 
a 
view 
to 
injuries 
and 
hostile 
acts. 
What 
will 
happen 
if 
this 
pledge 
is 
broken? 
The 
community, 
the 
disappointed 
creditor, 
will 
get 
what 
repayment 
it 
can, 
one 
may 
depend 
on 
that. 
The 
direct 
harm 
caused 
by 
the 
culprit 
is 
here 
a 
minor 
matter; 
quite 
apart 
from 
this, 
the 
lawbreaker 
is 
above 
all 
a 
“breaker,” 
a 
breaker 
of 
his 
contract 
and 
his 
word 
with 
the 
whole 
in 
respect 
to 
all 
the 
benefits 
and 
comforts 
of 
communal 
life 
of 
which 
he 
has 
hitherto 
had 
a 
share. 
The 
lawbreaker 
is 
a 
debtor 
who 
has 
not 
merely 
failed 
to 
make 
good 
the 
advantages 
and 
advance 
payments 
bestowed 
upon 
him 
but 
has 
actually 
attacked 
his 
creditor: 
therefore 
he 
is 
not 
only 
deprived 
henceforth 
of 
all 
these 
advantages 
and 
benefits, 
as 
is 
fair—he 
is 
also 
reminded 
what 
these 
benefits 
are 
really 
worth. 
The 
wrath 
of 
the 
disappointed 
creditor, 
the 
community, 
throws 
him 
back 
again 
into 
the 
savage 
and 
outlaw 
state 
against 
which 
he 
has 
hitherto 
been 
protected: 
it 
thrusts 
him 
away—and 
now 
every 
kind 
of 
hostility 
may 
be 
vented 
upon 
him. 
“Punishment” 
at 
this 
level 
of 
civilization 
is 
simply 
a 
copy, 
a 
mimus, 
of 
the 
normal 
attitude 
toward 
a 
hated, 
disarmed, 
prostrated 
enemy, 
who 
has 
lost 
not 
only 
every 
right 
and 
protection, 
but 
all 
hope 
of 
quarter 
as 
well; 
it 
is 
thus 
the 
rights 
of 
war 
and 
the 
victory 
celebration 
of 
the 
vae 
victis!3 
in 
all 
their 
mercilessness 
and 
cruelty—which 
explains 
why 
it 
is 
that 
war 
itself 
(including 
the 
warlike 
sacrificial 
cult) 
has 
provided 
all 
the 
forms 
that 
punishment 
has 
assumed 
throughout 
history. 



10 


As 
its 
power 
increases, 
a 
community 
ceases 
to 
take 
the 
individual’s 
transgressions 
so 
seriously, 
because 
they 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
considered 
as 
dangerous 
and 
destructive 
to 
the 
whole 
as 
they 
were 
formerly: 
the 
malefactor 
is 
no 
longer 
“set 
beyond 
the 
pale 
of 
peace” 
and 
thrust 
out; 
universal 
anger 
may 
not 
be 
vented 
upon 
him 
as 
unrestrainedly 
as 
before—on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
whole 
from 
now 
on 
carefully 
defends 
the 
malefactor 
against 
this 
anger, 
especially 
that 
of 
those 
he 
has 
directly 
harmed, 
and 
takes 
him 
under 
its 
protection. 
A 
compromise 
with 
the 
anger 
of 
those 
directly 
injured 
by 
the 
criminal; 
an 
effort 
to 
localize 
the 
affair 
and 
to 
prevent 
it 
from 
causing 
any 
further, 
let 
alone 
a 
general, 
disturbance; 
attempts 
to 
discover 
equivalents 
and 
to 
settle 
the 
whole 
matter 
(compositio); 
above 
all, 
the 
increasingly 
definite 
will 
to 
treat 
every 
crime 
as 
in 
some 
sense 
dischargeable, 
and 
thus 
at 
least 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
to 
isolate 
the 
criminal 
and 
his 
deed 
from 
one 
another—these 
traits 
become 
more 
and 
more 
clearly 
visible 
as 
the 
penal 
law 
evolves. 
As 
the 
power 
and 
self-confidence 
of 
a 
community 
increase, 
the 
penal 
law 
always 
becomes 
more 
moderate; 
every 
weakening 
or 
imperiling 
of 
the 
former 
brings 
with 
it 
a 
restoration 
of 
the 
harsher 
forms 
of 
the 
latter. 
The 
“creditor” 
always 
becomes 
more 
humane 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
he 
has 
grown 
richer; 
finally, 
how 
much 
injury 
he 
can 
endure 
without 
suffering 
from 
it 
becomes 
the 
actual 
measure 
of 
his 
wealth. 
It 
is 
not 
unthinkable 
that 
a 
society 
might 
attain 
such 
a 
consciousness 
of 
power 
that 
it 
could 
allow 
itself 
the 
noblest 
luxury 
possible 
to 
it—letting 
those 
who 
harm 
it 
go 
unpunished. 
“What 
are 
my 
parasites 
to 
me?” 
it 
might 
say. 
“May 
they 
live 
and 
prosper: 
I 
am 
strong 
enough 
for 
that!” 


The 
justice 
which 
began 
with, 
“everything 
is 
dischargeable, 
everything 
must 
be 
discharged,” 
ends 
by 
winking 
and 
letting 
those 
incapable 
of 
discharging 
their 
debt 
go 
free: 
it 
ends, 
as 
does 
every 
good 
thing 
on 
earth, 
by 
overcoming 
itself.1 


This 
self-overcoming 
of 
justice: 
one 
knows 
the 
beautiful 
name 
it 
has 
given 
itself—mercy; 
it 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
mercy 
remains 
the 
privilege 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
man, 
or 
better, 
his—beyond 
the 
law.2 



11 


Here 
a 
word 
in 
repudiation 
of 
attempts 
that 
have 
lately 
been 
made 
to 
seek 
the 
origin 
of 
justice 
in 
quite 
a 
different 
sphere—namely 
in 
that 
of 
ressentiment. 
To 
the 
psychologists 
first 
of 
all, 
presuming 
they 
would 
like 
to 
study 
ressentiment 
close 
up 
for 
once, 
I 
would 
say: 
this 
plant 
blooms 
best 
today 
among 
anarchists 
and 
anti-Semites—where 
it 
has 
always 
bloomed, 
in 
hidden 
places, 
like 
the 
violet, 
though 
with 
a 
different 
odor. 
And 
as 
like 
must 
always 
produce 
like, 
it 
causes 
us 
no 
surprise 
to 
see 
a 
repetition 
in 
such 
circles 
of 
attempts 
often 
made 
before—see 
above, 
section 
14—to 
sanctify 
revenge1 
under 
the 
name 
of 
justice2 


—as 
if 
justice 
were 
at 
bottom 
merely 
a 
further 
development 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
being 
aggrieved—and 
to 
rehabilitate 
not 
only 
revenge 
but 
all 
reactive 
affects 
in 
general. 
To 
the 
latter 
as 
such 
I 
would 
be 
the 
last 
to 
raise 
any 
objection: 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
entire 
biological 
problem 
(in 
relation 
to 
which 
the 
value 
of 
these 
affects 
has 
hitherto 
been 
underrated) 
it 
even 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
constitute 
a 
service. 
All 
I 
draw 
attention 
to 
is 
the 
circumstance 
that 
it 
is 
the 
spirit 
of 
ressentiment 
itself 
out 
of 
which 
this 
new 
nuance 
of 
scientific 
fairness 
(for 
the 
benefit 
of 
hatred, 
envy, 
jealousy, 
mistrust, 
rancor, 
and 
revenge) 
proceeds. 
For 
this 
“scientific 
fairness” 
immediately 
ceases 
and 
gives 
way 
to 
accents 
of 
deadly 
enmity 
and 
prejudice 
once 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
dealing 
with 
another 
group 
of 
affects, 
affects 
that, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
are 
of 
even 
greater 
biological 
value 
than 
those 
reactive 
affects 
and 
consequently 
deserve 
even 
more 
to 
be 
scientifically 
evaluated 
and 
esteemed: 
namely, 
the 
truly 
active 
affects, 
such 
as 
lust 
for 
power, 
avarice, 
and 
the 
like. 
(E. 
Dühring:3 


The 
Value 
of 
Life; 
A 
Course 
in 
Philosophy; 
and, 
fundamentally, 
passim.) 


So 
much 
against 
this 
tendency 
in 
general: 
as 
for 
Dühring’s 
specific 
proposition 
that 
the 
home 
of 
justice 
is 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
reactive 
feelings, 
one 
is 
obliged 
for 
truth’s 
sake 
to 
counter 
it 
with 
a 
blunt 
antithesis: 
the 
last 
sphere 
to 
be 
conquered 
by 
the 
spirit 
of 
justice 
is 
the 
sphere 
of 
the 
reactive 
feelings! 
When 
it 
really 
happens 
that 
the 
just 
man 
remains 
just 
even 
toward 
those 
who 
have 
harmed 
him 
(and 
not 
merely 
cold, 
temperate, 
remote, 
indifferent: 
being 
just 
is 
always 
a 
positive 
attitude), 
when 
the 
exalted, 



clear 
objectivity, 
as 
penetrating 
as 
it 
is 
mild, 
of 
the 
eye 
of 
justice 
and 
judging 
is 
not 
dimmed 
even 
under 
the 
assault 
of 
personal 
injury, 
derision, 
and 
calumny, 
this 
is 
a 
piece 
of 
perfection 
and 
supreme 
mastery 
on 
earth— 
something 
it 
would 
be 
prudent 
not 
to 
expect 
or 
to 
believe 
in 
too 
readily. 
On 
the 
average, 
a 
small 
dose 
of 
aggression, 
malice, 
or 
insinuation 
certainly 
suffices 
to 
drive 
the 
blood 
into 
the 
eyes—and 
fairness 
out 
of 
the 
eyes—of 
even 
the 
most 
upright 
people. 
The 
active, 
aggressive, 
arrogant 
man 
is 
still 
a 
hundred 
steps 
closer 
to 
justice 
than 
the 
reactive 
man; 
for 
he 
has 
absolutely 
no 
need 
to 
take 
a 
false 
and 
prejudiced 
view 
of 
the 
object 
before 
him 
in 
the 
way 
the 
reactive 
man 
does 
and 
is 
bound 
to 
do. 
For 
that 
reason 
the 
aggressive 
man, 
as 
the 
stronger, 
nobler, 
more 
courageous, 
has 
in 
fact 
also 
had 
at 
all 
times 
a 
freer 
eye, 
a 
better 
conscience 
on 
his 
side: 
conversely, 
one 
can 
see 
who 
has 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
“bad 
conscience” 
on 
his 
conscience—the 
man 
of 


ressentiment! 


Finally, 
one 
only 
has 
to 
look 
at 
history: 
in 
which 
sphere 
has 
the 
entire 
administration 
of 
law4 
hitherto 
been 
at 
home—also 
the 
need 
for 
law? 
In 
the 
sphere 
of 
reactive 
men, 
perhaps? 
By 
no 
means: 
rather 
in 
that 
of 
the 
active, 
strong, 
spontaneous, 
aggressive. 
From 
a 
historical 
point 
of 
view, 
law 
represents 
on 
earth—let 
it 
be 
said 
to 
the 
dismay 
of 
the 
above-named 
agitator 
(who 
himself 
once 
confessed: 
“the 
doctrine 
of 
revenge 
is 
the 
red 
thread 
of 
justice 
that 
runs 
through 
all 
my 
work 
and 
efforts”)—the 
struggle 
against 
the 
reactive 
feelings, 
the 
war 
conducted 
against 
them 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
active 
and 
aggressive 
powers 
who 
employed 
some 
of 
their 
strength 
to 
impose 
measure 
and 
bounds 
upon 
the 
excesses 
of 
the 
reactive 
pathos 
and 
to 
compel 
it 
to 
come 
to 
terms. 
Wherever 
justice 
is 
practiced 
and 
maintained 
one 
sees 
a 
stronger 
power 
seeking 
a 
means 
of 
putting 
an 
end 
to 
the 
senseless 
raging 
of 
ressentiment 
among 
the 
weaker 
powers 
that 
stand 
under 
it 
(whether 
they 
be 
groups 
or 
individuals)—partly 
by 
taking 
the 
object 
of 
ressentiment 
out 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
revenge, 
partly 
by 
substituting 
for 
revenge 
the 
struggle 
against 
the 
enemies 
of 
peace 
and 
order, 
partly 
by 
devising 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
imposing 
settlements, 
partly 
by 
elevating 
certain 
equivalents 
for 
injuries 
into 
norms 
to 
which 
from 
then 
on 
ressentiment 
is 
once 
and 
for 
all 
directed. 
The 
most 
decisive 
act, 
however, 
that 
the 
supreme 
power 
performs 
and 
accomplishes 
against 
the 
predominance 
of 
grudges 
and 
rancor—it 
always 
takes 
this 
action 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
in 
any 
way 
strong 
enough 
to 
do 
so—is 
the 
institution 
of 
law,5 
the 
imperative 
declaration 
of 
what 
in 
general 
counts 
as 
permitted, 
as 
just,6 
in 
its 
eves, 
and 
what 
counts 
as 
forbidden, 
as 
unjust:7 
once 
it 
has 
instituted 
the 



law, 
it 
treats 
violence 
and 
capricious 
acts 
on 
the 
part 
of 
individuals 
or 
entire 
groups 
as 
offenses 
against 
the 
law, 
as 
rebellion 
against 
the 
supreme 
power 
itself, 
and 
thus 
leads 
the 
feelings 
of 
its 
subjects 
away 
from 
the 
direct 
injury 
caused 
by 
such 
offenses; 
and 
in 
the 
long 
run 
it 
thus 
attains 
the 
reverse 
of 
that 
which 
is 
desired 
by 
all 
revenge 
that 
is 
fastened 
exclusively 
to 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
the 
person 
injured: 
from 
now 
on 
the 
eye 
is 
trained 
to 
an 
ever 
more 
impersonal 
evaluation 
of 
the 
deed, 
and 
this 
applies 
even 
to 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
injured 
person 
himself 
(although 
last 
of 
all, 
as 
remarked 
above). 


“Just” 
and 
“unjust” 
exist, 
accordingly, 
only 
after 
the 
institution 
of 
the 
law 
(and 
not, 
as 
Dühring 
would 
have 
it, 
after 
the 
perpetration 
of 
the 
injury). 
To 
speak 
of 
just 
or 
unjust 
in 
itself 
is 
quite 
senseless; 
in 
itself, 
of 
course, 
no 
injury, 
assault, 
exploitation, 
destruction 
can 
be 
“unjust,” 
since 
life 
operates 
essentially, 
that 
is 
in 
its 
basic 
functions, 
through 
injury, 
assault, 
exploitation, 
destruction 
and 
simply 
cannot 
be 
thought 
of 
at 
all 
without 
this 
character. 
One 
must 
indeed 
grant 
something 
even 
more 
unpalatable: 
that, 
from 
the 
highest 
biological 
standpoint, 
legal 
conditions 
can 
never 
be 
other 
than 
exceptional 
conditions, 
since 
they 
constitute 
a 
partial 
restriction 
of 
the 
will 
of 
life, 
which 
is 
bent 
upon 
power, 
and 
are 
subordinate 
to 
its 
total 
goal 
as 
a 
single 
means: 
namely, 
as 
a 
means 
of 
creating 
greater 
units 
of 
power. 
A 
legal 
order 
thought 
of 
as 
sovereign 
and 
universal, 
not 
as 
a 
means 
in 
the 
struggle 
between 
power-
complexes 
but 
as 
a 
means 
of 
preventing 
all 
struggle 
in 
general—perhaps 
after 
the 
communistic 
cliché 
of 
Dühring, 
that 
every 
will 
must 
consider 
every 
other 
will 
its 
equal—would 
be 
a 
principle 
hostile 
to 
life, 
an 
agent 
of 
the 
dissolution 
and 
destruction 
of 
man, 
an 
attempt 
to 
assassinate 
the 
future 
of 
man, 
a 
sign 
of 
weariness, 
a 
secret 
path 
to 
nothingness.— 



12 


Yet 
a 
word 
on 
the 
origin 
and 
the 
purpose 
of 
punishment—two 
problems 
that 
are 
separate, 
or 
ought 
to 
be 
separate: 
unfortunately, 
they 
are 
usually 
confounded. 
How 
have 
previous 
genealogists 
of 
morals 
set 
about 
solving 
these 
problems? 
Naïvely, 
as 
has 
always 
been 
their 
way: 
they 
seek 
out 
some 
“purpose” 
in 
punishment, 
for 
example, 
revenge 
or 
deterrence, 
then 
guilelessly 
place 
this 
purpose 
at 
the 
beginning 
as 
causa 
fiendi1 
of 
punishment, 
and—have 
done. 
The 
“purpose 
of 
law,” 
however, 
is 
absolutely 
the 
last 
thing 
to 
employ 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
law: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
there 
is 
for 
historiography 
of 
any 
kind 
no 
more 
important 
proposition 
than 
the 
one 
it 
took 
such 
effort 
to 
establish 
but 
which 
really 
ought 
to 
be 
established 
now: 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
thing 
and 
its 
eventual 
utility, 
its 
actual 
employment 
and 
place 
in 
a 
system 
of 
purposes, 
lie 
worlds 
apart; 
whatever 
exists, 
having 
somehow 
come 
into 
being, 
is 
again 
and 
again 
reinterpreted 
to 
new 
ends, 
taken 
over, 
transformed, 
and 
redirected 
by 
some 
power 
superior 
to 
it; 
all 
events 
in 
the 
organic 
world 
are 
a 
subduing, 
a 
becoming 
master, 
and 
all 
subduing 
and 
becoming 
master 
involves 
a 
fresh 
interpretation, 
an 
adaptation 
through 
which 
any 
previous 
“meaning” 
and 
“purpose” 
are 
necessarily 
obscured 
or 
even 
obliterated. 
However 
well 
one 
has 
understood 
the 
utility 
of 
any 
physiological 
organ 
(or 
of 
a 
legal 
institution, 
a 
social 
custom, 
a 
political 
usage, 
a 
form 
in 
art 
or 
in 
a 
religious 
cult), 
this 
means 
nothing 
regarding 
its 
origin: 
however 
uncomfortable 
and 
disagreeable 
this 
may 
sound 
to 
older 
ears 
—for 
one 
had 
always 
believed 
that 
to 
understand 
the 
demonstrable 
purpose, 
the 
utility 
of 
a 
thing, 
a 
form, 
or 
an 
institution, 
was 
also 
to 
understand 
the 
reason 
why 
it 
originated—the 
eye 
being 
made 
for 
seeing, 
the 
hand 
being 
made 
for 
grasping. 


Thus 
one 
also 
imagined 
that 
punishment 
was 
devised 
for 
punishing. 
But 
purposes 
and 
utilities 
are 
only 
signs 
that 
a 
will 
to 
power 
has 
become 
master 
of 
something 
less 
powerful 
and 
imposed 
upon 
it 
the 
character 
of 
a 
function; 
and 
the 
entire 
history 
of 
a 
“thing,” 
an 
organ, 
a 
custom 
can 
in 
this 
way 
be 
a 
continuous 
sign-chain 
of 
ever 
new 
interpretations 
and 
adaptations 
whose 
causes 
do 
not 
even 
have 
to 
be 
related 
to 
one 
another 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
in 



some 
cases 
succeed 
and 
alternate 
with 
one 
another 
in 
a 
purely 
chance 
fashion. 
The 
“evolution” 
of 
a 
thing, 
a 
custom, 
an 
organ 
is 
thus 
by 
no 
means 
its 
progressus 
toward 
a 
goal, 
even 
less 
a 
logical 
progressus 
by 
the 
shortest 
route 
and 
with 
the 
smallest 
expenditure 
of 
force—but 
a 
succession 
of 
more 
or 
less 
profound, 
more 
or 
less 
mutually 
independent 
processes 
of 
subduing, 
plus 
the 
resistances 
they 
encounter, 
the 
attempts 
at 
transformation 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
defense 
and 
reaction, 
and 
the 
results 
of 
successful 
counteractions. 
The 
form 
is 
fluid, 
but 
the 
“meaning” 
is 
even 
more 
so. 


The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
even 
within 
each 
individual 
organism: 
with 
every 
real 
growth 
in 
the 
whole, 
the 
“meaning” 
of 
the 
individual 
organs 
also 
changes; 
in 
certain 
circumstances 
their 
partial 
destruction, 
a 
reduction 
in 
their 
numbers 
(for 
example, 
through 
the 
disappearance 
of 
intermediary 
members) 
can 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
increasing 
strength 
and 
perfection. 
It 
is 
not 
too 
much 
to 
say 
that 
even 
a 
partial 
diminution 
of 
utility, 
an 
atrophying 
and 
degeneration, 
a 
loss 
of 
meaning 
and 
purposiveness—in 
short, 
death—is 
among 
the 
conditions 
of 
an 
actual 
progressus, 
which 
always 
appears 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
will 
and 
way 
to 
greater 
power 
and 
is 
always 
carried 
through 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
numerous 
smaller 
powers. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
an 
“advance” 
can 
even 
be 
measured 
by 
the 
mass 
of 
things 
that 
had 
to 
be 
sacrificed 
to 
it; 
mankind 
in 
the 
mass 
sacrificed 
to 
the 
prosperity 
of 
a 
single 
stronger 
species 
of 
man—that 
would 
be 
an 
advance. 


I 
emphasize 
this 
major 
point 
of 
historical 
method 
all 
the 
more 
because 
it 
is 
in 
fundamental 
opposition 
to 
the 
now 
prevalent 
instinct 
and 
taste 
which 
would 
rather 
be 
reconciled 
even 
to 
the 
absolute 
fortuitousness, 
even 
the 
mechanistic 
senselessness 
of 
all 
events 
than 
to 
the 
theory 
that 
in 
all 
events 
a 
will 
to 
power 
is 
operating. 
The 
democratic 
idiosyncracy 
which 
opposes 
everything 
that 
dominates 
and 
wants 
to 
dominate, 
the 
modern 
misarchism2 


(to 
coin 
an 
ugly 
word 
for 
an 
ugly 
thing) 
has 
permeated 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
spirit 
and 
disguised 
itself 
in 
the 
most 
spiritual 
forms 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
that 
today 
it 
has 
forced 
its 
way, 
has 
acquired 
the 
right 
to 
force 
its 
way 
into 
the 
strictest, 
apparently 
most 
objective 
sciences; 
indeed, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
have 
already 
taken 
charge 
of 
all 
physiology 
and 
theory 
of 
life—to 
the 
detriment 
of 
life, 
as 
goes 
without 
saying, 
since 
it 
has 
robbed 
it 
of 
a 
fundamental 
concept, 
that 
of 
activity. 
Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
idiosyncracy, 
one 
places 
instead 
“adaptation” 
in 
the 
foreground, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
an 
activity 
of 
the 
second 
rank, 
a 
mere 
reactivity; 
indeed, 
life 
itself 
has 
been 
defined 
as 
a 
more 
and 
more 
efficient 
inner 
adaptation 
to 
external 
conditions 
(Herbert 



Spencer3 


). 
Thus 
the 
essence 
of 
life, 
its 
will 
to 
power, 
is 
ignored; 
one 
overlooks 
the 
essential 
priority 
of 
the 
spontaneous, 
aggressive, 
expansive, 
form-giving 
forces 
that 
give 
new 
interpretations 
and 
directions, 
although 
“adaptation” 
follows 
only 
after 
this; 
the 
dominant 
role 
of 
the 
highest 
functionaries 
within 
the 
organism 
itself 
in 
which 
the 
will 
to 
life 
appears 
active 
and 
form-giving 
is 
denied. 
One 
should 
recall 
what 
Huxley4 
reproached 
Spencer 
with—his 
“administrative 
nihilism”: 
but 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
rather 
more 
than 
mere 
“administration.” 



13 


To 
return 
to 
our 
subject, 
namely 
punishment, 
one 
must 
distinguish 
two 
aspects: 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
that 
in 
it 
which 
is 
relatively 
enduring, 
the 
custom, 
the 
act, 
the 
“drama,” 
a 
certain 
strict 
sequence 
of 
procedures; 
on 
the 
other, 
that 
in 
it 
which 
is 
fluid, 
the 
meaning, 
the 
purpose, 
the 
expectation 
associated 
with 
the 
performance 
of 
such 
procedures. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
previously 
developed 
major 
point 
of 
historical 
method, 
it 
is 
assumed 
without 
further 
ado 
that 
the 
procedure 
itself 
will 
be 
something 
older, 
earlier 
than 
its 
employment 
in 
punishment, 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
projected 
and 
interpreted 
into 
the 
procedure 
(which 
has 
long 
existed 
but 
been 
employed 
in 
another 
sense), 
in 
short, 
that 
the 
case 
is 
not 
as 
has 
hitherto 
been 
assumed 
by 
our 
naïve 
genealogists 
of 
law 
and 
morals, 
who 
have 
one 
and 
all 
thought 
of 
the 
procedure 
as 
invented 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
punishing, 
just 
as 
one 
formerly 
thought 
of 
the 
hand 
as 
invented 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
grasping. 


As 
for 
the 
other 
element 
in 
punishment, 
the 
fluid 
element, 
its 
“meaning,” 
in 
a 
very 
late 
condition 
of 
culture 
(for 
example, 
in 
modern 
Europe) 
the 
concept 
“punishment” 
possesses 
in 
fact 
not 
one 
meaning 
but 
a 
whole 
synthesis 
of 
“meanings”: 
the 
previous 
history 
of 
punishment 
in 
general, 
the 
history 
of 
its 
employment 
for 
the 
most 
various 
purposes, 
finally 
crystallizes 
into 
a 
kind 
of 
unity 
that 
is 
hard 
to 
disentangle, 
hard 
to 
analyze 
and, 
as 
must 
be 
emphasized 
especially, 
totally 
indefinable. 
(Today 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
say 
for 
certain 
why 
people 
are 
really 
punished: 
all 
concepts 
in 
which 
an 
entire 
process 
is 
semiotically 
concentrated 
elude 
definition; 
only 
that 
which 
has 
no 
history 
is 
definable.1) 
At 
an 
earlier 
stage, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
this 
synthesis 
of 
“meanings” 
can 
still 
be 
disentangled, 
as 
well 
as 
changed; 
one 
can 
still 
perceive 
how 
in 
each 
individual 
case 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
synthesis 
undergo 
a 
shift 
in 
value 
and 
rearrange 
themselves 
accordingly, 
so 
that 
now 
this, 
now 
that 
element 
comes 
to 
the 
fore 
and 
dominates 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
others; 
and 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
one 
element 
(the 
purpose 
of 
deterrence 
perhaps) 
appears 
to 
overcome 
all 
the 
remaining 
elements. 


To 
give 
at 
least 
an 
idea 
of 
how 
uncertain, 
how 
supplemental, 
how 
accidental 
“the 
meaning” 
of 
punishment 
is, 
and 
how 
one 
and 
the 
same 



procedure 
can 
be 
employed, 
interpreted, 
adapted 
to 
ends 
that 
differ 
fundamentally, 
I 
set 
down 
here 
the 
pattern 
that 
has 
emerged 
from 
consideration 
of 
relatively 
few 
chance 
instances 
I 
have 
noted. 
Punishment 
as 
a 
means 
of 
rendering 
harmless, 
of 
preventing 
further 
harm. 
Punishment 
as 
recompense 
to 
the 
injured 
party 
for 
the 
harm 
done, 
rendered 
in 
any 
form 
(even 
in 
that 
of 
a 
compensating 
affect). 
Punishment 
as 
the 
isolation 
of 
a 
disturbance 
of 
equilibrium, 
so 
as 
to 
guard 
against 
any 
further 
spread 
of 
the 
disturbance. 
Punishment 
as 
a 
means 
of 
inspiring 
fear 
of 
those 
who 
determine 
and 
execute 
the 
punishment. 
Punishment 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
repayment 
for 
the 
advantages 
the 
criminal 
has 
enjoyed 
hitherto 
(for 
example, 
when 
he 
is 
employed 
as 
a 
slave 
in 
the 
mines). 
Punishment 
as 
the 
expulsion 
of 
a 
degenerate 
element 
(in 
some 
cases, 
of 
an 
entire 
branch, 
as 
in 
Chinese 
law: 
thus 
as 
a 
means 
of 
preserving 
the 
purity 
of 
a 
race 
or 
maintaining 
a 
social 
type). 
Punishment 
as 
a 
festival, 
namely 
as 
the 
rape 
and 
mockery 
of 
a 
finally 
defeated 
enemy. 
Punishment 
as 
the 
making 
of 
a 
memory, 
whether 
for 
him 
who 
suffers 
the 
punishment—so-called 
“improvement”—or 
for 
those 
who 
witness 
its 
execution. 
Punishment 
as 
payment 
of 
a 
fee 
stipulated 
by 
the 
power 
that 
protects 
the 
wrongdoer 
from 
the 
excesses 
of 
revenge. 
Punishment 
as 
a 
compromise 
with 
revenge 
in 
its 
natural 
state 
when 
the 
latter 
is 
still 
maintained 
and 
claimed 
as 
a 
privilege 
by 
powerful 
clans. 
Punishment 
as 
a 
declaration 
of 
war 
and 
a 
war 
measure 
against 
an 
enemy 
of 
peace, 
of 
the 
law, 
of 
order, 
of 
the 
authorities, 
whom, 
as 
a 
danger 
to 
the 
community, 
as 
one 
who 
has 
broken 
the 
contract 
that 
defines 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
it 
exists, 
as 
a 
rebel, 
a 
traitor, 
and 
breaker 
of 
the 
peace, 
one 
opposes 
with 
the 
means 
of 
war. 
— 



14 


This 
list 
is 
certainly 
not 
complete; 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
punishment 
is 
overdetermined1 
by 
utilities 
of 
all 
kinds. 
All 
the 
more 
reason, 
then, 
for 
deducting 
from 
it 
a 
supposed 
utility 
that, 
to 
be 
sure, 
counts 
in 
the 
popular 
consciousness 
as 
the 
most 
essential 
one—belief 
in 
punishment, 
which 
for 
several 
reasons 
is 
tottering 
today, 
always 
finds 
its 
strongest 
support 
in 
this. 
Punishment 
is 
supposed 
to 
possess 
the 
value 
of 
awakening 
the 
feeling 
of 
guilt 
in 
the 
guilty 
person; 
one 
seeks 
in 
it 
the 
actual 
instrumentum 
of 
that 
psychical 
reaction 
called 
“bad 
conscience,” 
“sting 
of 
conscience.” 
Thus 
one 
misunderstands 
psychology 
and 
the 
reality 
of 
things 
even 
as 
they 
apply 
today: 
how 
much 
more 
as 
they 
applied 
during 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
man’s 
history, 
his 
prehistory! 


It 
is 
precisely 
among 
criminals 
and 
convicts 
that 
the 
sting 
of 
conscience 
is 
extremely 
rare; 
prisons 
and 
penitentiaries 
are 
not 
the 
kind 
of 
hotbed 
in 
which 
this 
species 
of 
gnawing 
worm 
is 
likely 
to 
flourish: 
all 
conscientious 
observers 
are 
agreed 
on 
that, 
in 
many 
cases 
unwillingly 
enough 
and 
contrary 
to 
their 
own 
inclinations. 
Generally 
speaking, 
punishment 
makes 
men 
hard 
and 
cold; 
it 
concentrates; 
it 
sharpens 
the 
feeling 
of 
alienation; 
it 
strengthens 
the 
power 
of 
resistance. 
If 
it 
happens 
that 
punishment 
destroys 
the 
vital 
energy 
and 
brings 
about 
a 
miserable 
prostration 
and 
self-abasement, 
such 
a 
result 
is 
certainly 
even 
less 
pleasant 
than 
the 
usual 
effects 
of 
punishment— 
characterized 
by 
dry 
and 
gloomy 
seriousness. 


If 
we 
consider 
those 
millennia 
before 
the 
history 
of 
man, 
we 
may 
unhesitatingly 
assert 
that 
it 
was 
precisely 
through 
punishment 
that 
the 
development 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
guilt 
was 
most 
powerfully 
hindered—at 
least 
in 
the 
victims 
upon 
whom 
the 
punitive 
force 
was 
vented. 
For 
we 
must 
not 
underrate 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
judicial 
and 
executive 
procedures 
prevents 
the 
criminal 
from 
considering 
his 
deed, 
the 
type 
of 
his 
action 
as 
such, 
reprehensible: 
for 
he 
sees 
exactly 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
actions 
practiced 
in 
the 
service 
of 
justice 
and 
approved 
of 
and 
practiced 
with 
a 
good 
conscience: 
spying, 
deception, 
bribery, 
setting 
traps, 
the 
whole 
cunning 
and 
underhand 
art 
of 
police 
and 
prosecution, 
plus 
robbery, 
violence, 
defamation, 



imprisonment, 
torture, 
murder, 
practiced 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle 
and 
without 
even 
emotion 
to 
excuse 
them, 
which 
are 
pronounced 
characteristics 
of 
the 
various 
forms 
of 
punishment—all 
of 
them 
therefore 
actions 
which 
his 
judges 
in 
no 
way 
condemn 
and 
repudiate 
as 
such, 
but 
only 
when 
they 
are 
applied 
and 
directed 
to 
certain 
particular 
ends. 


The 
“bad 
conscience,” 
this 
most 
uncanny 
and 
most 
interesting 
plant 
of 
all 
our 
earthly 
vegetation, 
did 
not 
grow 
on 
this 
soil; 
indeed, 
during 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
past 
the 
judges 
and 
punishers 
themselves 
were 
not 
at 
all 
conscious 
of 
dealing 
with 
a 
“guilty 
person.” 
But 
with 
an 
instigator 
of 
harm, 
with 
an 
irresponsible 
piece 
of 
fate. 
And 
the 
person 
upon 
whom 
punishment 
subsequently 
descended, 
again 
like 
a 
piece 
of 
fate, 
suffered 
no 
“inward 
pain” 
other 
than 
that 
induced 
by 
the 
sudden 
appearance 
of 
something 
unforeseen, 
a 
dreadful 
natural 
event, 
a 
plunging, 
crushing 
rock 
that 
one 
cannot 
fight. 



15 


This 
fact 
once 
came 
insidiously 
into 
the 
mind 
of 
Spinoza 
(to 
the 
vexation 
of 
his 
interpreters, 
Kuno 
Fischer,1 
for 
example, 
who 
make 
a 
real 
effort 
to 
misunderstand 
him 
on 
this 
point), 
when 
one 
afternoon, 
teased 
by 
who 
knows 
what 
recollection, 
he 
mused 
on 
the 
question 
of 
what 
really 
remained 
to 
him 
of 
the 
famous 
morsus 
conscientiae2 
—he 
who 
had 
banished 
good 
and 
evil 
to 
the 
realm 
of 
human 
imagination 
and 
had 
wrathfully 
defended 
the 
honor 
of 
his 
“free” 
God 
against 
those 
blasphemers 
who 
asserted 
that 
God 
effected 
all 
things 
sub 
ratione 
boni3 
(“but 
that 
would 
mean 
making 
God 
subject 
to 
fate 
and 
would 
surely 
be 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
absurdities”). 
The 
world, 
for 
Spinoza, 
had 
returned 
to 
that 
state 
of 
innocence 
in 
which 
it 
had 
lain 
before 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
bad 
conscience: 
what 
then 
had 
become 
of 
the 
morsus 
conscientiae? 


“The 
opposite 
of 
gaudium,”4 
he 
finally 
said 
to 
himself—“a 
sadness 
accompanied 
by 
the 
recollection 
of 
a 
past 
event 
that 
flouted 
all 
of 
our 
expectations.” 
Eth.III, 
propos. 
XVIII, 
schol. 
I. 
II. 
Mischief-makers 
overtaken 
by 
punishments 
have 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
felt 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
“transgressions” 
just 
as 
Spinoza 
did: 
“here 
something 
has 
unexpectedly 
gone 
wrong,” 
not: 
“I 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
done 
that.” 
They 
submitted 
to 
punishment 
as 
one 
submits 
to 
an 
illness 
or 
to 
a 
misfortune 
or 
to 
death, 
with 
that 
stouthearted 
fatalism 
without 
rebellion 
through 
which 
the 
Russians, 
for 
example, 
still 
have 
an 
advantage 
over 
us 
Westerners 
in 
dealing 
with 
life. 


If 
there 
existed 
any 
criticism 
of 
the 
deed 
in 
those 
days, 
it 
was 
prudence 
that 
criticized 
the 
deed: 
the 
actual 
effect 
of 
punishment 
must 
beyond 
question 
be 
sought 
above 
all 
in 
a 
heightening 
of 
prudence, 
in 
an 
extending 
of 
the 
memory, 
in 
a 
will 
henceforth 
to 
go 
to 
work 
more 
cautiously, 
mistrustfully, 
secretly, 
in 
the 
insight 
that 
one 
is 
definitely 
too 
weak 
for 
many 
things, 
in 
a 
kind 
of 
improvement 
in 
self-criticism. 
That 
which 
can 
in 
general 
be 
attained 
through 
punishment, 
in 
men 
and 
in 
animals, 
is 
an 
increase 
of 
fear, 
a 
heightening 
of 
prudence, 
mastery 
of 
the 
desires: 
thus 
punishment 
tames 
men, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
make 
them 
“better”—one 
might 
with 
more 
justice 
assert 
the 
opposite. 
(“Injury 
makes 
one 
prudent,” 
says 
the 
proverb: 
insofar 
as 
it 
makes 



one 
prudent 
it 
also 
makes 
one 
bad. 
Fortunately, 
it 
frequently 
makes 
people 
stupid.) 



16 


At 
this 
point 
I 
can 
no 
longer 
avoid 
giving 
a 
first, 
provisional 
statement 
of 
my 
own 
hypothesis 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
“bad 
conscience”: 
it 
may 
sound 
rather 
strange 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
pondered, 
lived 
with, 
and 
slept 
on 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
I 
regard 
the 
bad 
conscience 
as 
the 
serious 
illness 
that 
man 
was 
bound 
to 
contract 
under 
the 
stress 
of 
the 
most 
fundamental 
change 
he 
ever 
experienced—that 
change 
which 
occurred 
when 
he 
found 
himself 
finally 
enclosed 
within 
the 
walls 
of 
society 
and 
of 
peace. 
The 
situation 
that 
faced 
sea 
animals 
when 
they 
were 
compelled 
to 
become 
land 
animals 
or 
perish 
was 
the 
same 
as 
that 
which 
faced 
these 
semi-animals, 
well 
adapted 
to 
the 
wilderness, 
to 
war, 
to 
prowling, 
to 
adventure: 
suddenly 
all 
their 
instincts 
were 
disvalued 
and 
“suspended.” 
From 
now 
on 
they 
had 
to 
walk 
on 
their 
feet 
and 
“bear 
themselves” 
whereas 
hitherto 
they 
had 
been 
borne 
by 
the 
water: 
a 
dreadful 
heaviness 
lay 
upon 
them. 
They 
felt 
unable 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
simplest 
undertakings; 
in 
this 
new 
world 
they 
no 
longer 
possessed 
their 
former 
guides, 
their 
regulating, 
unconscious 
and 
infallible 
drives: 
they 
were 
reduced 
to 
thinking, 
inferring, 
reckoning, 
co-ordinating 
cause 
and 
effect, 
these 
unfortunate 
creatures; 
they 
were 
reduced 
to 
their 
“consciousness,” 
their 
weakest 
and 
most 
fallible 
organ! 
I 
believe 
there 
has 
never 
been 
such 
a 
feeling 
of 
misery 
on 
earth, 
such 
a 
leaden 
discomfort—and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
old 
instincts 
had 
not 
suddenly 
ceased 
to 
make 
their 
usual 
demands! 
Only 
it 
was 
hardly 
or 
rarely 
possible 
to 
humor 
them: 
as 
a 
rule 
they 
had 
to 
seek 
new 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
subterranean 
gratifications. 


All 
instincts 
that 
do 
not 
discharge 
themselves 
outwardly 
turn 
inward—this 
is 
what 
I 
call 
the 
internalization1 
of 
man: 
thus 
it 
was 
that 
man 
first 
developed 
what 
was 
later 
called 
his 
“soul.” 
The 
entire 
inner 
world, 
originally 
as 
thin 
as 
if 
it 
were 
stretched 
between 
two 
membranes, 
expanded 
and 
extended 
itself, 
acquired 
depth, 
breadth, 
and 
height, 
in 
the 
same 
measure 
as 
outward 
discharge 
was 
inhibited. 
Those 
fearful 
bulwarks 
with 
which 
the 
political 
organization 
protected 
itself 
against 
the 
old 
instincts 
of 
freedom— 
punishments 
belong 
among 
these 
bulwarks—brought 
about 
that 
all 
those 
instincts 
of 
wild, 
free, 
prowling 
man 
turned 
backward 
against 
man 
himself. 



Hostility, 
cruelty, 
joy 
in 
persecuting, 
in 
attacking, 
in 
change, 
in 
destruction— 
all 
this 
turned 
against 
the 
possessors 
of 
such 
instincts: 
that 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
“bad 
conscience.” 


The 
man 
who, 
from 
lack 
of 
external 
enemies 
and 
resistances 
and 
forcibly 
confined 
to 
the 
oppressive 
narrowness 
and 
punctiliousness 
of 
custom, 
impatiently 
lacerated, 
persecuted, 
gnawed 
at, 
assaulted, 
and 
maltreated 
himself; 
this 
animal 
that 
rubbed 
itself 
raw 
against 
the 
bars 
of 
its 
cage 
as 
one 
tried 
to 
“tame” 
it; 
this 
deprived 
creature, 
racked 
with 
homesickness 
for 
the 
wild, 
who 
had 
to 
turn 
himself 
into 
an 
adventure, 
a 
torture 
chamber, 
an 
uncertain 
and 
dangerous 
wilderness—this 
fool, 
this 
yearning 
and 
desperate 
prisoner 
became 
the 
inventor 
of 
the 
“bad 
conscience.” 
But 
thus 
began 
the 
gravest 
and 
uncanniest 
illness, 
from 
which 
humanity 
has 
not 
yet 
recovered, 
man’s 
suffering 
of 
man, 
of 
himself—the 
result 
of 
a 
forcible 
sundering 
from 
his 
animal 
past, 
as 
it 
were 
a 
leap 
and 
plunge 
into 
new 
surroundings 
and 
conditions 
of 
existence, 
a 
declaration 
of 
war 
against 
the 
old 
instincts 
upon 
which 
his 
strength, 
joy, 
and 
terribleness 
had 
rested 
hitherto. 


Let 
us 
add 
at 
once 
that, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
existence 
on 
earth 
of 
an 
animal 
soul 
turned 
against 
itself, 
taking 
sides 
against 
itself, 
was 
something 
so 
new, 
profound, 
unheard 
of, 
enigmatic, 
contradictory, 
and 
pregnant 
with 
a 
future 
that 
the 
aspect 
of 
the 
earth 
was 
essentially 
altered. 
Indeed, 
divine 
spectators 
were 
needed 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
spectacle 
that 
thus 
began 
and 
the 
end 
of 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
in 
sight—a 
spectacle 
too 
subtle, 
too 
marvelous, 
too 
paradoxical 
to 
be 
played 
senselessly 
unobserved 
on 
some 
ludicrous 
planet! 
From 
now 
on, 
man 
is 
included 
among 
the 
most 
unexpected 
and 
exciting 
lucky 
throws 
in 
the 
dice 
game 
of 
Heraclitus’ 
“great 
child,” 
be 
he 
called 
Zeus 
or 
chance; 
he 
gives 
rise 
to 
an 
interest, 
a 
tension, 
a 
hope, 
almost 
a 
certainty, 
as 
if 
with 
him 
something 
were 
announcing 
and 
preparing 
itself, 
as 
if 
man 
were 
not 
a 
goal 
but 
only 
a 
way, 
an 
episode, 
a 
bridge, 
a 
great 
promise.— 



17 


Among 
the 
presuppositions 
of 
this 
hypothesis 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
bad 
conscience 
is, 
first, 
that 
the 
change 
referred 
to 
was 
not 
a 
gradual 
or 
voluntary 
one 
and 
did 
not 
represent 
an 
organic 
adaptation 
to 
new 
conditions 
but 
a 
break, 
a 
leap, 
a 
compulsion, 
an 
ineluctable 
disaster 
which 
precluded 
all 
struggle 
and 
even 
all 
ressentiment. 
Secondly, 
however, 
that 
the 
welding 
of 
a 
hitherto 
unchecked 
and 
shapeless 
populace 
into 
a 
firm 
form 
was 
not 
only 
instituted 
by 
an 
act 
of 
violence 
but 
also 
carried 
to 
its 
conclusion 
by 
nothing 
but 
acts 
of 
violence—that 
the 
oldest 
“state” 
thus 
appeared 
as 
a 
fearful 
tyranny, 
as 
an 
oppressive 
and 
remorseless 
machine, 
and 
went 
on 
working 
until 
this 
raw 
material 
of 
people 
and 
semi-animals 
was 
at 
last 
not 
only 
thoroughly 
kneaded 
and 
pliant 
but 
also 
formed. 


I 
employed 
the 
word 
“state”: 
it 
is 
obvious 
what 
is 
meant—some 
pack 
of 
blond 
beasts 
of 
prey,1 
a 
conqueror 
and 
master 
race 
which, 
organized 
for 
war 
and 
with 
the 
ability 
to 
organize, 
unhesitatingly 
lays 
its 
terrible 
claws 
upon 
a 
populace 
perhaps 
tremendously 
superior 
in 
numbers 
but 
still 
formless 
and 
nomad. 
That 
is 
after 
all 
how 
the 
“state” 
began 
on 
earth: 
I 
think 
that 
sentimentalism 
which 
would 
have 
it 
begin 
with 
a 
“contract” 
has 
been 
disposed 
of. 
He 
who 
can 
command, 
he 
who 
is 
by 
nature 
“master,” 
he 
who 
is 
violent 
in 
act 
and 
bearing—what 
has 
he 
to 
do 
with 
contracts! 
One 
does 
not 
reckon 
with 
such 
natures; 
they 
come 
like 
fate, 
without 
reason, 
consideration, 
or 
pretext; 
they 
appear 
as 
lightning 
appears, 
too 
terrible, 
too 
sudden, 
too 
convincing, 
too 
“different” 
even 
to 
be 
hated. 
Their 
work 
is 
an 
instinctive 
creation 
and 
imposition 
of 
forms; 
they 
are 
the 
most 
involuntary, 
unconscious 
artists 
there 
are—wherever 
they 
appear 
something 
new 
soon 
arises, 
a 
ruling 
structure 
that 
lives, 
in 
which 
parts 
and 
functions 
are 
delimited 
and 
coordinated, 
in 
which 
nothing 
whatever 
finds 
a 
place 
that 
has 
not 
first 
been 
assigned 
a 
“meaning” 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
whole. 
They 
do 
not 
know 
what 
guilt, 
responsibility, 
or 
consideration 
are, 
these 
born 
organizers; 
they 
exemplify 
that 
terrible 
artists’ 
egoism 
that 
has 
the 
look 
of 
bronze 
and 
knows 
itself 
justified 
to 
all 
eternity 
in 
its 
“work,” 
like 
a 
mother 
in 
her 
child. 
It 
is 
not 
in 
them 
that 
the 
“bad 
conscience” 
developed, 
that 
goes 
without 
saying—but 
it 



would 
not 
have 
developed 
without 
them, 
this 
ugly 
growth, 
it 
would 
be 
lacking 
if 
a 
tremendous 
quantity 
of 
freedom 
had 
not 
been 
expelled 
from 
the 
world, 
or 
at 
least 
from 
the 
visible 
world, 
and 
made 
as 
it 
were 
latent 
under 
their 
hammer 
blows 
and 
artists’ 
violence. 
This 
instinct 
for 
freedom 
forcibly 
made 
latent—we 
have 
seen 
it 
already—this 
instinct 
for 
freedom 
pushed 
back 
and 
repressed, 
incarcerated 
within 
and 
finally 
able 
to 
discharge 
and 
vent 
itself 
only 
on 
itself: 
that, 
and 
that 
alone, 
is 
what 
the 
bad 
conscience 
is 
in 
its 
beginnings. 



18 


One 
should 
guard 
against 
thinking 
lightly 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
merely 
on 
account 
of 
its 
initial 
painfulness 
and 
ugliness. 
For 
fundamentally 
it 
is 
the 
same 
active 
force 
that 
is 
at 
work 
on 
a 
grander 
scale 
in 
those 
artists 
of 
violence 
and 
organizers 
who 
build 
states, 
and 
that 
here, 
internally, 
on 
a 
smaller 
and 
pettier 
scale, 
directed 
backward, 
in 
the 
“labyrinth 
of 
the 
breast,” 
to 
use 
Goethe’s 
expression, 
creates 
for 
itself 
a 
bad 
conscience 
and 
builds 
negative 
ideals—namely, 
the 
instinct 
for 
freedom 
(in 
my 
language: 
the 
will 
to 
power); 
only 
here 
the 
material 
upon 
which 
the 
form-giving 
and 
ravishing 
nature 
of 
this 
force 
vents 
itself 
is 
man 
himself, 
his 
whole 
ancient 
animal 
self—and 
not, 
as 
in 
that 
greater 
and 
more 
obvious 
phenomenon, 
some 
other 
man, 
other 
men. 
This 
secret 
self-ravishment, 
this 
artists’ 
cruelty, 
this 
delight 
in 
imposing 
a 
form 
upon 
oneself 
as 
a 
hard, 
recalcitrant, 
suffering 
material 
and 
in 
burning 
a 
will, 
a 
critique, 
a 
contradiction, 
a 
contempt, 
a 
No 
into 
it, 
this 
uncanny, 
dreadfully 
joyous 
labor 
of 
a 
soul 
voluntarily 
at 
odds 
with 
itself 
that 
makes 
itself 
suffer 
out 
of 
joy 
in 
making 
suffer—eventually 
this 
entire 
active 
“bad 
conscience”—you 
will 
have 
guessed 
it—as 
the 
womb 
of 
all 
ideal 
and 
imaginative 
phenomena, 
also 
brought 
to 
light 
an 
abundance 
of 
strange 
new 
beauty 
and 
affirmation, 
and 
perhaps 
beauty 
itself.— 
After 
all, 
what 
would 
be 
“beautiful” 
if 
the 
contradiction 
had 
not 
first 
become 
conscious 
of 
itself, 
if 
the 
ugly 
had 
not 
first 
said 
to 
itself: 
“I 
am 
ugly”? 


This 
hint 
will 
at 
least 
make 
less 
enigmatic 
the 
enigma 
of 
how 
contradictory 
concepts 
such 
as 
selflessness, 
self-denial, 
self-sacrifice 
can 
suggest 
an 
ideal, 
a 
kind 
of 
beauty; 
and 
one 
thing 
we 
know 
henceforth—I 
have 
no 
doubt 
of 
it— 
and 
that 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
delight 
that 
the 
selfless 
man, 
the 
self-denier, 
the 
self-sacrificer 
feels 
from 
the 
first: 
this 
delight 
is 
tied 
to 
cruelty. 


So 
much 
for 
the 
present 
about 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
moral 
value 
of 
the 
“unegoistic,” 
about 
the 
soil 
from 
which 
this 
value 
grew: 
only 
the 
bad 
conscience, 
only 
the 
will 
to 
self-maltreatment 
provided 
the 
conditions 
for 
the 
value 
of 
the 
unegoistic.— 



19 


The 
bad 
conscience 
is 
an 
illness, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
about 
that, 
but 
an 
illness 
as 
pregnancy 
is 
an 
illness.1 


Let 
us 
seek 
out 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
this 
illness 
has 
reached 
its 
most 
terrible 
and 
most 
sublime 
height; 
we 
shall 
see 
what 
it 
really 
was 
that 
thus 
entered 
the 
world. 
But 
for 
that 
one 
needs 
endurance—and 
first 
of 
all 
we 
must 
go 
back 
again 
to 
an 
earlier 
point 
of 
view. 


The 
civil-law 
relationship 
between 
the 
debtor 
and 
his 
creditor, 
discussed 
above, 
has 
been 
interpreted 
in 
an, 
historically 
speaking, 
exceedingly 
remarkable 
and 
dubious 
manner 
into 
a 
relationship 
in 
which 
to 
us 
modern 
men 
it 
seems 
perhaps 
least 
to 
belong: 
namely 
into 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
present 
generation 
and 
its 
ancestors. 


Within 
the 
original 
tribal 
community—we 
are 
speaking 
of 
primeval 
times 
—the 
living 
generation 
always 
recognized 
a 
juridical 
duty 
toward 
earlier 
generations, 
and 
especially 
toward 
the 
earliest, 
which 
founded 
the 
tribe 
(and 
by 
no 
means 
a 
merely 
sentimental 
obligation: 
there 
are 
actually 
reasons 
for 
denying 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
latter 
for 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
human 
history). 
The 
conviction 
reigns 
that 
it 
is 
only 
through 
the 
sacrifices 
and 
accomplishments 
of 
the 
ancestors 
that 
the 
tribe 
exists—and 
that 
one 
has 
to 
pay 
them 
back 
with 
sacrifices 
and 
accomplishments: 
one 
thus 
recognizes 
a 
debt 
that 
constantly 
grows 
greater, 
since 
these 
forebears 
never 
cease, 
in 
their 
continued 
existence 
as 
powerful 
spirits, 
to 
accord 
the 
tribe 
new 
advantages 
and 
new 
strength. 
In 
vain, 
perhaps? 
But 
there 
is 
no 
“in 
vain” 
for 
these 
rude 
and 
“poor-souled” 
ages. 
What 
can 
one 
give 
them 
in 
return? 
Sacrifices 
(initially 
as 
food 
in 
the 
coarsest 
sense), 
feasts, 
music, 
honors; 
above 
all, 
obedience—for 
all 
customs, 
as 
works 
of 
the 
ancestors, 
are 
also 
their 
statutes 
and 
commands: 
can 
one 
ever 
give 
them 
enough? 
This 
suspicion 
remains 
and 
increases; 
from 
time 
to 
time 
it 
leads 
to 
a 
wholesale 
sacrifice, 
something 
tremendous 
in 
the 
way 
of 
repayment 
to 
the 
“creditor” 
(the 
notorious 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
first-born, 
for 
example; 
in 
any 
case 
blood, 
human 
blood). 


The 
fear 
of 
the 
ancestor 
and 
his 
power, 
the 
consciousness 
of 
indebtedness 
to 
him, 
increases, 
according 
to 
this 
kind 
of 
logic, 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
measure 



as 
the 
power 
of 
the 
tribe 
itself 
increases, 
as 
the 
tribe 
itself 
grows 
ever 
more 
victorious, 
independent, 
honored, 
and 
feared. 
By 
no 
means 
the 
other 
way 
round! 
Every 
step 
toward 
the 
decline 
of 
a 
tribe, 
every 
misfortune, 
every 
sign 
of 
degeneration, 
of 
coming 
disintegration 
always 
diminishes 
fear 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
its 
founder 
and 
produces 
a 
meaner 
impression 
of 
his 
cunning, 
foresight, 
and 
present 
power. 
If 
one 
imagines 
this 
rude 
kind 
of 
logic 
carried 
to 
its 
end, 
then 
the 
ancestors 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
tribes 
are 
bound 
eventually 
to 
grow 
to 
monstrous 
dimensions 
through 
the 
imagination 
of 
growing 
fear 
and 
to 
recede 
into 
the 
darkness 
of 
the 
divinely 
uncanny 
and 
unimaginable: 
in 
the 
end 
the 
ancestor 
must 
necessarily 
be 
transfigured 
into 
a 
god. 
Perhaps 
this 
is 
even 
the 
origin 
of 
gods, 
an 
origin 
therefore 
out 
of 
fear! 
… 
And 
whoever 
should 
feel 
obliged 
to 
add, 
“but 
out 
of 
piety 
also!” 
would 
hardly 
be 
right 
for 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
man, 
his 
prehistory. 
To 
be 
sure, 
he 
would 
be 
quite 
right 
for 
the 
intermediate 
age, 
in 
which 
the 
noble 
tribes 
developed—who 
indeed 
paid 
back 
their 
originators, 
their 
ancestors 
(heroes, 
gods) 
with 
interest 
all 
the 
qualities 
that 
had 
become 
palpable 
in 
themselves, 
the 
noble 
qualities. 
We 
shall 
take 
another 
look 
later 
at 
the 
ennoblement 
of 
the 
gods 
(which 
should 
not 
be 
confused 
with 
their 
becoming 
“holy”); 
let 
us 
first 
of 
all 
follow 
to 
its 
end 
the 
course 
of 
this 
whole 
development 
of 
the 
consciousness 
of 
guilt. 



20 


History 
shows 
that 
the 
consciousness 
of 
being 
in 
debt1 
to 
the 
deity 
did 
not 
by 
any 
means 
come 
to 
an 
end 
together 
with 
the 
organization 
of 
communities 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
blood 
relationship. 
Even 
as 
mankind 
inherited 
the 
concepts 
“good 
and 
bad” 
from 
the 
tribal 
nobility 
(along 
with 
its 
basic 
psychological 
propensity 
to 
set 
up 
orders 
of 
rank), 
it 
also 
inherited, 
along 
with 
the 
tribal 
and 
family 
divinities, 
the 
burden 
of 
still 
unpaid 
debts 
and 
of 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
relieved 
of 
them. 
(The 
transition 
is 
provided 
by 
those 
numerous 
slave 
and 
dependent 
populations 
who, 
whether 
through 
compulsion 
or 
through 
servility 
and 
mimicry, 
adapted 
themselves 
to 
their 
masters’ 
cult 
of 
the 
gods: 
this 
inheritance 
then 
overflows 
from 
them 
in 
all 
directions.) 
The 
guilty 
feeling 
of 
indebtedness2 
to 
the 
divinity 
continued 
to 
grow 
for 
several 
millennia— 
always 
in 
the 
same 
measure 
as 
the 
concept 
of 
God 
and 
the 
feeling 
for 
divinity 
increased 
on 
earth 
and 
was 
carried 
to 
the 
heights. 
(The 
entire 
history 
of 
ethnic 
struggle, 
victory, 
reconciliation, 
fusion, 
everything 
that 
precedes 
the 
definitive 
ordering 
of 
rank 
of 
the 
different 
national 
elements 
in 
every 
great 
racial 
synthesis, 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
confused 
genealogies 
of 
their 
gods, 
in 
the 
sagas 
of 
the 
gods’ 
struggles, 
victories, 
and 
reconciliations; 
the 
advance 
toward 
universal 
empires 
is 
always 
also 
an 
advance 
toward 
universal 
divinities; 
despotism 
with 
its 
triumph 
over 
the 
independent 
nobility 
always 
prepares 
the 
way 
for 
some 
kind 
of 
monotheism.) 


The 
advent 
of 
the 
Christian 
God, 
as 
the 
maximum 
god 
attained 
so 
far, 
was 
therefore 
accompanied 
by 
the 
maximum 
feeling 
of 
guilty 
indebtedness3 
on 
earth. 
Presuming 
we 
have 
gradually 
entered 
upon 
the 
reverse 
course, 
there 
is 
no 
small 
probability 
that 
with 
the 
irresistible 
decline 
of 
faith 
in 
the 
Christian 
God 
there 
is 
now 
also 
a 
considerable 
decline 
in 
mankind’s 
feeling 
of 
guilt;4 
indeed, 
the 
prospect 
cannot 
be 
dismissed 
that 
the 
complete 
and 
definitive 
victory 
of 
atheism 
might 
free 
mankind 
of 
this 
whole 
feeling 
of 
guilty 


6

indebtedness5 
toward 
its 
origin, 
its 
causa 
prima. 
Atheism 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
second 
innocence7 
belong 
together.— 



21 


So 
much 
for 
a 
first 
brief 
preliminary 
on 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
concepts 
“guilt” 
and 
“duty” 
with 
religious 
presuppositions: 
I 
have 
up 
to 
now 
deliberately 
ignored 
the 
moralization 
of 
these 
concepts 
(their 
pushing 
back 
into 
the 
conscience; 
more 
precisely, 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
bad 
conscience 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
god); 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
last 
section 
I 
even 
spoke 
as 
if 
this 
moralization 
had 
not 
taken 
place 
at 
all, 
and 
as 
if 
these 
concepts 
were 
now 
necessarily 
doomed 
since 
their 
presupposition, 
the 
faith 
in 
our 
“creditor,”1 
in 
God, 
had 
disappeared. 
The 
reality 
is, 
to 
a 
fearful 
degree, 
otherwise. 


The 
moralization 
of 
the 
concepts 
guilt 
and 
duty, 
their 
being 
pushed 
back 
into 
the 
bad 
conscience, 
actually 
involves 
an 
attempt 
to 
reverse 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
development 
described 
above, 
or 
at 
least 
to 
bring 
it 
to 
a 
halt: 
the 
aim 
now 
is 
to 
preclude 
pessimistically, 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
the 
prospect 
of 
a 
final 
discharge; 
the 
aim 
now 
is 
to 
make 
the 
glance 
recoil 
disconsolately 
from 
an 
iron 
impossibility; 
the 
aim 
now 
is 
to 
turn 
back 
the 
concepts 
“guilt” 
and 
“duty”—back 
against 
whom? 
There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt: 
against 
the 
“debtor” 
first 
of 
all, 
in 
whom 
from 
now 
on 
the 
bad 
conscience 
is 
firmly 
rooted, 
eating 
into 
him 
and 
spreading 
within 
him 
like 
a 
polyp, 
until 
at 
last 
the 
irredeemable 
debt 
gives 
rise 
to 
the 
conception 
of 
irredeemable 
penance, 
the 
idea 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
discharged 
(“eternal 
punishment”). 
Finally, 
however, 
they 
are 
turned 
back 
against 
the 
“creditor,” 
too: 
whether 
we 
think 
of 
the 
causa 
prima 
of 
man, 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
its 
primal 
ancestor 
who 
is 
from 
now 
on 
burdened 
with 
a 
curse 
(“Adam,” 
“original 
sin,” 
“unfreedom 
of 
the 
will”), 
or 
of 
nature 
from 
whose 
womb 
mankind 
arose 
and 
into 
whom 
the 
principle 
of 
evil 
is 
projected 
from 
now 
on 
(“the 
diabolizing 
of 
nature”), 
or 
of 
existence 
in 
general, 
which 
is 
now 
considered 
worthless 
as 
such 
(nihilistic 
withdrawal 
from 
it, 
a 
desire 
for 
nothingness 
or 
a 
desire 
for 
its 
antithesis, 
for 
a 
different 
mode 
of 
being, 
Buddhism 
and 
the 
like)—suddenly 
we 
stand 
before 
the 
paradoxical 
and 
horrifying 
expedient 
that 
afforded 
temporary 
relief 
for 
tormented 
humanity, 
that 
stroke 
of 
genius 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Christianity: 
God 
himself 
sacrifices 
himself 
for 
the 
guilt 
of 
mankind, 
God 
himself 
makes 
payment 
to 
himself, 
God 
as 
the 
only 
being 
who 
can 
redeem 
man 
from 
what 



has 
become 
unredeemable 
for 
man 
himself—the 
creditor 
sacrifices 
himself 
for 
his 
debtor, 
out 
of 
love 
(can 
one 
credit 
that?), 
out 
of 
love 
for 
his 
debtor!— 



22 


You 
will 
have 
guessed 
what 
has 
really 
happened 
here, 
beneath 
all 
this: 
that 
will 
to 
self-tormenting, 
that 
repressed 
cruelty 
of 
the 
animal-man 
made 
inward 
and 
scared 
back 
into 
himself, 
the 
creature 
imprisoned 
in 
the 
“state” 
so 
as 
to 
be 
tamed, 
who 
invented 
the 
bad 
conscience 
in 
order 
to 
hurt 
himself 
after 
the 
more 
natural 
vent 
for 
this 
desire 
to 
hurt 
had 
been 
blocked—this 
man 
of 
the 
bad 
conscience 
has 
seized 
upon 
the 
presupposition 
of 
religion 
so 
as 
to 
drive 
his 
self-torture 
to 
its 
most 
gruesome 
pitch 
of 
severity 
and 
rigor. 
Guilt 
before 
God: 
this 
thought 
becomes 
an 
instrument 
of 
torture 
to 
him. 
He 
apprehends 
in 
“God” 
the 
ultimate 
antithesis 
of 
his 
own 
ineluctable 
animal 
instincts; 
he 
reinterprets 
these 
animal 
instincts 
themselves 
as 
a 
form 
of 
guilt 
before 
God 
(as 
hostility, 
rebellion, 
insurrection 
against 
the 
“Lord,” 
the 
“father,” 
the 
primal 
ancestor 
and 
origin 
of 
the 
world); 
he 
stretches 
himself 
upon 
the 
contradiction 
“God” 
and 
“Devil”; 
he 
ejects 
from 
himself 
all 
his 
denial 
of 
himself, 
of 
his 
nature, 
naturalness, 
and 
actuality, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
affirmation, 
as 
something 
existent, 
corporeal, 
real, 
as 
God, 
as 
the 
holiness 
of 
God, 
as 
God 
the 
Judge, 
as 
God 
the 
Hangman, 
as 
the 
beyond, 
as 
eternity, 
as 
torment 
without 
end, 
as 
hell, 
as 
the 
immeasurability 
of 
punishment 
and 
guilt. 


In 
this 
psychical 
cruelty 
there 
resides 
a 
madness 
of 
the 
will 
which 
is 
absolutely 
unexampled: 
the 
will 
of 
man 
to 
find 
himself 
guilty 
and 
reprehensible 
to 
a 
degree 
that 
can 
never 
be 
atoned 
for; 
his 
will 
to 
think 
himself 
punished 
without 
any 
possibility 
of 
the 
punishment 
becoming 
equal 
to 
the 
guilt; 
his 
will 
to 
infect 
and 
poison 
the 
fundamental 
ground 
of 
things 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
punishment 
and 
guilt 
so 
as 
to 
cut 
off 
once 
and 
for 
all 
his 
own 
exit 
from 
this 
labyrinth 
of 
“fixed 
ideas”; 
his 
will 
to 
erect 
an 
ideal—that 
of 
the 
“holy 
God”—and 
in 
the 
face 
of 
it 
to 
feel 
the 
palpable 
certainty 
of 
his 
own 
absolute 
unworthiness. 
Oh 
this 
insane, 
pathetic 
beast—man! 
What 
ideas 
he 
has, 
what 
unnaturalness, 
what 
paroxysms 
of 
nonsense, 
what 
bestiality 
of 
thought 
erupts 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
is 
prevented 
just 
a 
little 
from 
being 
a 
beast 
in 
deed! 


All 
this 
is 
interesting, 
to 
excess, 
but 
also 
of 
a 
gloomy, 
black, 
unnerving 
sadness, 
so 
that 
one 
must 
forcibly 
forbid 
oneself 
to 
gaze 
too 
long 
into 
these 
abysses. 
Here 
is 
sickness, 
beyond 
any 
doubt, 
the 
most 
terrible 
sickness 
that 



has 
ever 
raged 
in 
man; 
and 
whoever 
can 
still 
bear 
to 
hear 
(but 
today 
one 
no 
longer 
has 
ears 
for 
this!) 
how 
in 
this 
night 
of 
torment 
and 
absurdity 
there 
has 
resounded 
the 
cry 
of 
love, 
the 
cry 
of 
the 
most 
nostalgic 
rapture, 
of 
redemption 
through 
love, 
will 
turn 
away, 
seized 
by 
invincible 
horror.— 
There 
is 
so 
much 
in 
man 
that 
is 
hideous!— 
Too 
long, 
the 
earth 
has 
been 
a 
madhouse!— 



23 


This 
should 
dispose 
once 
and 
for 
all 
of 
the 
question 
of 
how 
the 
“holy 
God” 
originated. 


That 
the 
conception 
of 
gods 
in 
itself 
need 
not 
lead 
to 
the 
degradation 
of 
the 
imagination 
that 
we 
had 
to 
consider 
briefly, 
that 
there 
are 
nobler 
uses 
for 
the 
invention 
of 
gods 
than 
for 
the 
self-crucifixion 
and 
self-violation 
of 
man 
in 
which 
Europe 
over 
the 
past 
millennia 
achieved 
its 
distinctive 
mastery—that 
is 
fortunately 
revealed 
even 
by 
a 
mere 
glance 
at 
the 
Greek 
gods, 
those 
reflections 
of 
noble 
and 
autocratic 
men, 
in 
whom 
the 
animal 
in 
man 
felt 
deified 
and 
did 
not 
lacerate 
itself, 
did 
not 
rage 
against 
itself! 
For 
the 
longest 
time 
these 
Greeks 
used 
their 
gods 
precisely 
so 
as 
to 
ward 
off 
the 
“bad 
conscience,” 
so 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
rejoice 
in 
their 
freedom 
of 
soul—the 
very 
opposite 
of 
the 
use 
to 
which 
Christianity 
put 
its 
God. 
They 
went 
very 
jar 
in 
this 
direction, 
these 
splendid 
and 
lion-hearted 
children; 
and 
no 
less 
an 
authority 
than 
the 
Homeric 
Zeus 
himself 
occasionally 
gives 
them 
to 
understand 
that 
they 
are 
making 
things 
too 
easy 
for 
themselves. 
“Strange!” 
he 
says 
once—the 
case 
is 
that 
of 
Aegisthus, 
a 
very 
bad 
case— 


Strange 
how 
these 
mortals 
so 
loudly 
complain 
of 
the 
gods! 
We 
alone 
produce 
evil, 
they 
say; 
yet 
themselves 
Make 
themselves 
wretched 
through 
folly, 
even 
counter 
to 
fate.1 


Yet 
one 
can 
see 
and 
hear 
how 
even 
this 
Olympian 
spectator 
and 
judge 
is 
far 
from 
holding 
a 
grudge 
against 
them 
or 
thinking 
ill 
of 
them 
on 
that 
account: 
“how 
foolish 
they 
are!” 
he 
thinks 
when 
he 
observes 
the 
misdeeds 
of 
mortals—and 
“foolishness,” 
“folly,” 
a 
little 
“disturbance 
in 
the 
head,” 
this 
much 
even 
the 
Greeks 
of 
the 
strongest, 
bravest 
age 
conceded 
of 
themselves 
as 
the 
reason 
for 
much 
that 
was 
bad 
and 
calamitous—foolishness, 
not 
sin! 
do 
you 
grasp 
that? 


Even 
this 
disturbance 
in 
the 
head, 
however, 
presented 
a 
problem: 
“how 
is 
it 
possible? 
how 
could 
it 
actually 
have 
happened 
to 
heads 
such 
as 
we 
have, 
we 
men 
of 
aristocratic 
descent, 
of 
the 
best 
society, 
happy, 
well-constituted, 
noble, 
and 
virtuous?”—thus 
noble 
Greeks 
asked 
themselves 
for 
centuries 
in 



the 
face 
of 
every 
incomprehensible 
atrocity 
or 
wantonness 
with 
which 
one 
of 
their 
kind 
had 
polluted 
himself. 
“He 
must 
have 
been 
deluded 
by 
a 
god” 
they 
concluded 
finally, 
shaking 
their 
heads 
… 
This 
expedient 
is 
typical 
of 
the 
Greeks 
… 
In 
this 
way 
the 
gods 
served 
in 
those 
days 
to 
justify 
man 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
even 
in 
his 
wickedness, 
they 
served 
as 
the 
originators 
of 
evil— 
in 
those 
days 
they 
took 
upon 
themselves, 
not 
the 
punishment 
but, 
what 
is 
nobler, 
the 
guilt.2 



24 


I 
end 
up 
with 
three 
question 
marks; 
that 
seems 
plain. 
“What 
are 
you 
really 
doing, 
erecting 
an 
ideal 
or 
knocking 
one 
down?” 
I 
may 
perhaps 
be 
asked. 


But 
have 
you 
ever 
asked 
yourselves 
sufficiently 
how 
much 
the 
erection 
of 
every 
ideal 
on 
earth 
has 
cost? 
How 
much 
reality 
has 
had 
to 
be 
misunderstood 
and 
slandered, 
how 
many 
lies 
have 
had 
to 
be 
sanctified, 
how 
many 
consciences 
disturbed, 
how 
much 
“God” 
sacrificed 
every 
time? 
If 
a 
temple 
is 
to 
be 
erected 
a 
temple 
must 
be 
destroyed: 
that 
is 
the 
law—let 
anyone 
who 
can 
show 
me 
a 
case 
in 
which 
it 
is 
not 
fulfilled! 


We 
modern 
men 
are 
the 
heirs 
of 
the 
conscience-vivisection 
and 
selftorture3 
of 
millennia: 
this 
is 
what 
we 
have 
practiced 
longest, 
it 
is 
our 
distinctive 
art 
perhaps, 
and 
in 
any 
case 
our 
subtlety 
in 
which 
we 
have 
acquired 
a 
refined 
taste. 
Man 
has 
all 
too 
long 
had 
an 
“evil 
eye” 
for 
his 
natural 
inclinations, 
so 
that 
they 
have 
finally 
become 
inseparable 
from 
his 
“bad 
conscience.” 
An 
attempt 
at 
the 
reverse 
would 
in 
itself 
be 
possible—but 
who 
is 
strong 
enough 
for 
it?—that 
is, 
to 
wed 
the 
bad 
conscience 
to 
all 
the 
unnatural 
inclinations, 
all 
those 
aspirations 
to 
the 
beyond, 
to 
that 
which 
runs 
counter 
to 
sense, 
instinct, 
nature, 
animal, 
in 
short 
all 
ideals 
hitherto, 
which 
are 
one 
and 
all 
hostile 
to 
life 
and 
ideals 
that 
slander 
the 
world. 
To 
whom 
should 
one 
turn 
today 
with 
such 
hopes 
and 
demands? 


One 
would 
have 
precisely 
the 
good 
men 
against 
one; 
and, 
of 
course, 
the 
comfortable, 
the 
reconciled, 
the 
vain, 
the 
sentimental, 
the 
weary. 


What 
gives 
greater 
offense, 
what 
separates 
one 
more 
fundamentally, 
than 
to 
reveal 
something 
of 
the 
severity 
and 
respect 
with 
which 
one 
treats 
oneself? 
And 
on 
the 
other 
hand—how 
accommodating, 
how 
friendly 
all 
the 
world 
is 
toward 
us 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
act 
as 
all 
the 
world 
does 
and 
“let 
ourselves 
go” 
like 
all 
the 
world! 


The 
attainment 
of 
this 
goal 
would 
require 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
spirit 
from 
that 
likely 
to 
appear 
in 
this 
present 
age: 
spirits 
strengthened 
by 
war 
and 
victory, 
for 
whom 
conquest, 
adventure, 
danger, 
and 
even 
pain 
have 
become 
needs; 
it 
would 
require 
habituation 
to 
the 
keen 
air 
of 
the 
heights, 
to 
winter 
journeys, 
to 
ice 
and 
mountains 
in 
every 
sense; 
it 
would 
require 
even 
a 
kind 
of 



sublime 
wickedness, 
an 
ultimate, 
supremely 
self-confident 
mischievousness 
in 
knowledge 
that 
goes 
with 
great 
health; 
it 
would 
require, 
in 
brief 
and 
alas, 
precisely 
this 
great 
health! 


Is 
this 
even 
possible 
today?— 
But 
some 
day, 
in 
a 
stronger 
age 
than 
this 
decaying, 
self-doubting 
present, 
he 
must 
yet 
come 
to 
us, 
the 
redeeming 
man 
of 
great 
love 
and 
contempt, 
the 
creative 
spirit 
whose 
compelling 
strength 
will 
not 
let 
him 
rest 
in 
any 
aloofness 
or 
any 
beyond, 
whose 
isolation 
is 
misunderstood 
by 
the 
people 
as 
if 
it 
were 
flight 
from 
reality—while 
it 
is 
only 
his 
absorption, 
immersion, 
penetration 
into 
reality, 
so 
that, 
when 
he 
one 
day 
emerges 
again 
into 
the 
light, 
he 
may 
bring 
home 
the 
redemption 
of 
this 
reality: 
its 
redemption 
from 
the 
curse 
that 
the 
hitherto 
reigning 
ideal 
has 
laid 
upon 
it. 
This 
man 
of 
the 
future, 
who 
will 
redeem 
us 
not 
only 
from 
the 
hitherto 
reigning 
ideal 
but 
also 
from 
that 
which 
was 
bound 
to 
grow 
out 
of 
it, 
the 
great 
nausea, 
the 
will 
to 
nothingness, 
nihilism; 
this 
bell-stroke 
of 
noon 
and 
of 
the 
great 
decision 
that 
liberates 
the 
will 
again 
and 
restores 
its 
goal 
to 
the 
earth 
and 
his 
hope 
to 
man; 
this 
Antichrist 
and 
antinihilist; 
this 
victor 
over 
God 
and 
nothingness—he 
must 
come 
one 
day.— 



25 


But 
what 
am 
I 
saying? 
Enough! 
Enough! 
At 
this 
point 
it 
behooves 
me 
only 
to 
be 
silent; 
or 
I 
shall 
usurp 
that 
to 
which 
only 
one 
younger, 
“heavier 
with 
future,” 
and 
stronger 
than 
I 
has 
a 
right—that 
to 
which 
only 
Zarathustra 
has 
a 
right, 
Zarathustra 
the 
godless.—

Schlechtes 
Gewissen 
is 
no 
technical 
term 
but 
simply 
the 
common 
German 
equivalent 
of 
“bad 
conscience.” 
Danto’s 
translation 
“bad 
consciousness” 
(Nietzsche 
as 
Philosopher, 
New 
York, 
Macmillan, 
1965, 
pp. 
164 
and 
180) 
is 
simply 
wrong: 
Gewissen, 
like 
conscience, 
and 
unlike 
the 
French 
conscience, 
cannot 
mean 
consciousness. 


There 
are 
many 
mistranslations 
in 
Danto’s 
Nietzsche. 
Another 
one, 
though 
relatively 
unimportant, 
is 
of 
some 
interest 
and 
relevant 
to 
the 
Genealogy: 
Schadenfreude—a 
German 
word 
for 
which 
there 
is 
no 
English 
equivalent—is 
not 
quite 
“the 
wicked 
pleasure 
in 
the 
beholding 
of 
suffering” 
(p. 
181) 
or 
“in 
the 
sheer 
spectacle 
of 
suffering: 
in 
fights, 
executions, 
… 
bullbaiting, 
cockfights, 
and 
the 
like” 
(p. 
174). 
In 
such 
contexts 
the 
word 
is 
utterly 
out 
of 
place: 
it 
signifies 
the 
petty, 
mischievous 
delight 
felt 
in 
the 
discomfiture 
of 
another 
human 
being.

The 
parenthetical 
statement 
is 
the 
contrary 
of 
Kant’s 
view. 
When 
it 
was 
written, 
it 
must 
have 
struck 
most 
readers 
as 
paradoxical, 
but 
in 
the 
twentieth 
century 
it 
is 
apt 
to 
seem 
less 
paradoxical 
than 
Kant’s 
view. 
The 
Lonely 
Crowd 
(by 
David 
Riesman, 
with 
Nathan 
Glazer 
and 
Reuel 



Denney; 
New 
Haven, 
Conn.: 
Yale 
University 
Press, 
1950) 
has 
popularized 
a 
Nietzschean, 
non-Kantian 
conception 
of 
the 
autonomous 
individual, 
who 
is 
contrasted 
with 
the 
tradition-directed 
(Nietzsche’s 
morality 
of 
mores), 
the 
inner-directed 
(Kant, 
for 
example), 
and 
the 
other-directed 
(Nietzsche’s 
“last 
man”).

The 
German 
equivalent 
of 
“guilt” 
is 
Schuld; 
and 
the 
German 
for 
“debt(s)” 
is 
Schuld(en). 
“Innocent” 
is 
unschuldig; 
“debtor” 
is 
Schuldner; 
and 
so 
forth. 
This 
obviously 
poses 
problems 
for 
an 
English 
translation 
of 
this 
essay; 
but 
once 
the 
point 
has 
been 
clearly 
stated, 
no 
misunderstandings 
need 
result. 
Nietzsche’s 
claims 
obviously 
do 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
double 
meaning 
of 
a 
German 
word; 
nor 
are 
they 
weakened 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
English 
there 
are 
two 
different 
words, 
one 
derived 
from 
an 
Anglo-Saxon 
root, 
the 
other 
from 
Latin.

“Debts 
or 
guilt”: 
“Schulden.” 


Nietzsche, 
as 
usual, 
furnishes 
a 
page 
reference 
to 
the 
first 
edition— 
in 
this 
instance, 
pp. 
117ff., 
which 
would 
take 
us 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
section 
194 
and 
the 
following 
section(s); 
and 
German 
editors, 
down 
to 
Karl 
Schlechta, 
give 
the 
equivalent 
page 
reference. 
But 
117 
is 
plainly 
a 
misprint 
for 
177, 
which 
takes 
us 
to 
section 
229—beyond 
a 
doubt, 
the 
passage 
Nietzsche 
means. 


Section 
18 
is 
included 
in 
the 
present 
volume; 
section 
113 
is 
quoted 
and 
analyzed 
in 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
6, 
section 
II. 
Both 
repay 
reading 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
passage 
above, 
to 
avoid 
misunderstanding.

Sich 
selbst 
aufhebend. 
And 
in 
the 
next 
sentence 
Selbstaufhebung 
has 
been 
translated 
as 
self-overcoming. 
Similarly, 
aufzuheben 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
section 
13, 
below, 
and 
aufgehoben 
in 
section 
8 
of 
the 
third 
essay 
have 
been 
rendered 
“overcome.” 
See 
also 
III, 
section 
27, 
with 



note. 
Aufheben 
is 
a 
very 
troublesome 
word, 
though 
common 
in 
ordinary 
German. 
Literally, 
it 
means 
“pick 
up”; 
but 
it 
has 
two 
derivative 
meanings 
that 
are 
no 
less 
common: 
“cancel” 
and 
“preserve” 
or 
“keep.” 
Something 
picked 
up 
is 
no 
longer 
there, 
but 
the 
point 
of 
picking 
it 
up 
may 
be 
to 
keep 
it. 
Hegel 
made 
much 
of 
this 
term; 
his 
use 
of 
it 
is 
explained 
and 
discussed 
in 
Walter 
Kaufmann, 
Hegel 
(Garden 
City, 
N.Y., 
Doubleday, 
1965; 
Garden 
City, 
N.Y., 
Doubleday 
Anchor 
Books, 
1966), 
section 
34—and 
a 
comparison 
of 
Hegel 
and 
Nietzsche 
on 
this 
point 
may 
be 
found 
in 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
8, 
section 
II.

The 
theme 
sounded 
here 
is 
one 
of 
the 
central 
motifs 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
philosophy. 
Cf. 
Dawn, 
section 
202: 
“… 
Let 
us 
eliminate 
the 
concept 
of 
sin 
from 
the 
world—and 
let 
us 
soon 
dispatch 
the 
concept 
of 
punishment 
after 
it! 
May 
these 
exiled 
monsters 
live 
somewhere 
else 
henceforth 
and 
not 
among 
men—if 
they 
insist 
on 
living 
and 
will 
not 
perish 
of 
disgust 
with 
themselves! 
… 
Shouldn’t 
we 
be 
mature 
enough 
yet 
for 
the 
opposite 
view? 
Shouldn’t 
we 
be 
able 
to 
say 
yet: 
every 
‘guilty’ 
person 
is 
sick?— 
No, 
the 
hour 
for 
that 
has 
not 
yet 
come. 
As 
yet 
the 
physicians 
are 
lacking 
above 
all 
… 
As 
yet 
no 
thinker 
has 
had 
the 
courage 
of 
measuring 
the 
health 
of 
a 
society 
and 
of 
individuals 
according 
to 
how 
many 
parasites 
they 
can 
stand 
…” 
(See 
The 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
85–88.) 
Cf. 
also 
Zarathustra 
II, 
“On 
the 
Tarantulas”: 
“That 
man 
be 
delivered 
from 
revenge, 
that 
is 
for 
me 
the 
bridge 
to 
the 
highest 
hope 
…” 
(ibid., 
p. 
211).

Selbsttierquälerei: 
Tierquälerei 
really 
means 
cruelty

hence 
Nietzsche’s 
coinage 
suggests 
that 
this 
kind 
of 
self-torture 
involves 
mortification 
of 
the 
animal 
nature 
of 
man. 



Third 
Essay 


What 
Is 
the 
Meaning 
of 
Ascetic 
Ideals? 


Unconcerned, 
mocking, 
violent—thus 
wisdom 
wants 
us: 
she 
is 
a 
woman 
and 
always 
loves 
only 
a 
warrior. 
Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra1 



1 


What 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
ascetic 
ideals?— 
In 
the 
case 
of 
artists 
they 
mean 
nothing 
or 
too 
many 
things; 
in 
the 
case 
of 
philosophers 
and 
scholars 
something 
like 
a 
sense 
and 
instinct 
for 
the 
most 
favorable 
preconditions 
of 
higher 
spirituality; 
in 
the 
case 
of 
women 
at 
best 
one 
more 
seductive 
charm, 
a 
touch 
of 
morbidezza 
in 
fair 
flesh, 
the 
angelic 
look 
of 
a 
plump 
pretty 
animal; 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
physiologically 
deformed 
and 
deranged 
(the 
majority 
of 
mortals) 
an 
attempt 
to 
see 
themselves 
as 
“too 
good” 
for 
this 
world, 
a 
saintly 
form 
of 
debauch, 
their 
chief 
weapon 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
slow 
pain 
and 
boredom; 
in 
the 
case 
of 
priests 
the 
distinctive 
priestly 
faith, 
their 
best 
instrument 
of 
power, 
also 
the 
“supreme” 
license 
for 
power; 
in 
the 
case 
of 
saints, 
finally, 
a 
pretext 
for 
hibernation, 
their 
novissima 
gloriae 
cupido,2 
their 
repose 
in 
nothingness 
(“God”), 
their 
form 
of 
madness. 
That 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
meant 
so 
many 
things 
to 
man, 
however, 
is 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
basic 
fact 
of 
the 
human 
will, 
its 
horror 
vacui.3 
it 
needs 
a 
goal—and 
it 
will 
rather 
will 
nothingness 
than 
not 
will.— 
Am 
I 
understood? 
… 
Have 
I 
been 
understood? 
… 
“Not 
at 
all, 
my 
dear 
sir!”—Then 
let 
us 
start 
again, 
from 
the 
beginning. 



2 


What 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
ascetic 
ideals?— 
Or, 
to 
take 
an 
individual 
case 
that 
I 
have 
often 
been 
asked 
about: 
what 
does 
it 
mean, 
for 
example, 
when 
an 
artist 
like 
Richard 
Wagner 
pays 
homage 
to 
chastity 
in 
his 
old 
age? 
In 
a 
certain 
sense, 
to 
be 
sure, 
he 
had 
always 
done 
this: 
but 
only 
in 
the 
very 
end 
in 
an 
ascetic 
sense. 
What 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
change 
of 
“sense,” 
this 
radical 
reversal 
of 
sense?— 
for 
that 
is 
what 
it 
was: 
Wagner 
leaped 
over 
into 
his 
opposite. 
What 
does 
it 
mean 
when 
an 
artist 
leaps 
over 
into 
his 
opposite? 


Here, 
if 
we 
are 
disposed 
to 
pause 
a 
moment 
at 
this 
question, 
we 
are 
at 
once 
reminded 
of 
what 
was 
perhaps 
the 
finest, 
strongest, 
happiest, 
most 
courageous 
period 
of 
Wagner’s 
life: 
the 
period 
during 
which 
he 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
Luther’s 
wedding. 
Who 
knows 
upon 
what 
chance 
events 
it 
depended 
that 
instead 
of 
this 
wedding 
music 
we 
possess 
today 
Die 
Meistersinger? 
And 
how 
much 
of 
the 
former 
perhaps 
still 
echoes 
in 
the 
latter? 
But 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
“Luther’s 
Wedding” 
would 
also 
have 
involved 
a 
praise 
of 
chastity. 
And 
also 
a 
praise 
of 
sensuality, 
to 
be 
sure—and 
this 
would 
have 
seemed 
to 
be 
quite 
in 
order, 
quite 
“Wagnerian.” 


For 
there 
is 
no 
necessary 
antithesis 
between 
chastity 
and 
sensuality;1 
every 
good 
marriage, 
every 
genuine 
love 
affair, 
transcends 
this 
antithesis. 
Wagner 
would 
have 
done 
well, 
I 
think, 
to 
have 
brought 
this 
pleasant 
fact 
home 
once 
more 
to 
his 
Germans 
by 
means 
of 
a 
bold 
and 
beautiful 
Luther 
comedy, 
for 
there 
have 
always 
been 
and 
still 
are 
many 
slanderers 
of 
sensuality 
among 
the 
Germans; 
and 
perhaps 
Luther 
performed 
no 
greater 
service 
than 
to 
have 
had 
the 
courage 
of 
his 
sensuality 
(in 
those 
days 
it 
was 
called, 
delicately 
enough, 
“evangelical 
freedom”). 
But 
even 
in 
those 
cases 
in 
which 
this 
antithesis 
between 
chastity 
and 
sensuality 
really 
exists, 
there 
is 
fortunately 
no 
need 
for 
it 
to 
be 
a 
tragic 
antithesis. 
At 
least 
this 
holds 
good 
for 
all 
those 
well-
constituted, 
joyful 
mortals 
who 
are 
far 
from 
regarding 
their 
unstable 
equilibrium 
between 
“animal 
and 
angel” 
as 
necessarily 
an 
argument 
against 
existence—the 
subtlest 
and 
brightest 
among 
them 
have 
even 
found 
in 
it, 
like 
Goethe 
and 
Hafiz, 
one 
more 
stimulus 
to 
life. 
It 
is 
precisely 
such 
“contradictions” 
that 
seduce 
one 
to 
existence 
… 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
only 



too 
clear 
that 
when 
swine 
who 
have 
come 
to 
grief 
are 
finally 
induced 
to 
worship 
chastity—and 
there 
are 
such 
swine!—they 
will 
see 
and 
worship 
in 
it 
only 
their 
antithesis, 
the 
antithesis 
of 
failed 
swine—and 
one 
can 
imagine 
with 
what 
tragic 
zeal 
and 
grunting 
they 
will 
do 
so!—that 
embarrassing 
and 
superfluous 
antithesis 
which 
Richard 
Wagner 
at 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life 
unquestionably 
intended 
to 
set 
to 
music 
and 
put 
upon 
the 
stage. 
But 
why? 
as 
one 
might 
reasonably 
ask. 
For 
what 
were 
swine 
to 
him, 
what 
are 
they 
to 
us? 
— 



3 


This 
does 
not, 
of 
course, 
help 
us 
to 
avoid 
asking 
this 
other 
question, 
what 
that 
male 
(yet 
so 
unmanly) 
“country 
simpleton” 
was 
to 
him, 
that 
poor 
devil 
and 
nature 
boy 
Parsifal, 
whom 
he 
finally 
made 
into 
a 
Catholic 
by 
such 
captious 
means—what? 
was 
this 
Parsifal 
meant 
seriously? 
For 
one 
might 
be 
tempted 
to 
suppose 
the 
reverse, 
even 
to 
desire 
it—that 
the 
Wagnerian 
Parsifal 
was 
intended 
as 
a 
joke, 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
epilogue 
and 
satyr 
play 
with 
which 
the 
tragedian 
Wagner 
wanted 
to 
take 
leave 
of 
us, 
also 
of 
himself, 
above 
all 
of 
tragedy 
in 
a 
fitting 
manner 
worthy 
of 
himself, 
namely 
with 
an 
extravagance 
of 
wanton 
parody 
of 
the 
tragic 
itself, 
of 
the 
whole 
gruesome 
earthly 
seriousness 
and 
misery 
of 
his 
previous 
works, 
of 
the 
crudest 
form, 
overcome 
at 
long 
last, 
of 
the 
anti-nature 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal. 
This, 
to 
repeat, 
would 
have 
been 
worthy 
of 
a 
great 
tragedian, 
who, 
like 
every 
artist, 
arrives 
at 
the 
ultimate 
pinnacle 
of 
his 
greatness 
only 
when 
he 
comes 
to 
see 
himself 
and 
his 
art 
beneath 
him—when 
he 
knows 
how 
to 
laugh 
at 
himself. 


Is 
Wagner’s 
Parsifal 
his 
secret 
laughter 
of 
superiority 
at 
himself, 
the 
triumph 
of 
his 
ultimate 
artist’s 
freedom 
and 
artist’s 
transcendence? 
One 
could 
wish 
that 
it 
were, 
to 
repeat 
again; 
for 
what 
would 
a 
seriously-intended 
Parsifal 
be? 
Must 
one 
really 
see 
in 
him 
(as 
someone 
once 
put 
it 
to 
me) 
“the 
product 
of 
an 
insane 
hatred 
of 
knowledge, 
spirit, 
and 
sensuality”? 
A 
curse 
on 
the 
senses 
and 
the 
spirit 
in 
a 
single 
breath 
of 
hatred? 
An 
apostacy 
and 
return 
to 
morbid 
Christian 
and 
obscurantist 
ideals? 
And 
ultimately 
a 
self-negation, 
a 
self-cancellation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
an 
artist 
who 
had 
hitherto 
aimed 
with 
all 
the 
power 
of 
his 
will 
at 
the 
reverse, 
at 
the 
highest 
spiritualization 
and 
sensualization 
of 
his 
art? 
And 
not 
of 
his 
art 
only; 
of 
his 
life, 
too. 


One 
should 
recall 
how 
enthusiastically 
Wagner 
at 
one 
time 
followed 
in 
the 
footsteps 
of 
the 
philosopher 
Feuerbach:1 


Feuerbach’s 
cry 
of 
“healthy 
sensuality”—that 
sounded 
in 
the 
thirties 
and 
forties, 
to 
Wagner 
as 
to 
many 
other 
Germans 
(they 
called 
themselves 
the 
“young 
Germans”), 
like 
a 
cry 
of 
redemption. 
Did 
he 
at 
last 
come 
to 
learn 
otherwise? 
For 
at 
least 
it 
seems 
that 
he 
finally 
had 
the 
will 
to 
teach 
otherwise. 
And 
not 
only 
from 
the 
stage 
with 
the 
trumpets 
of 
Parsifal; 
in 
the 
murky 



writings 
of 
his 
last 
years, 
as 
unfree 
as 
they 
are 
perplexed, 
there 
are 
a 
hundred 
passages 
that 
betray 
a 
secret 
wish 
and 
will, 
a 
despairing, 
unsure, 
unacknowledged 
will 
to 
preach 
nothing 
other 
than 
reversion, 
conversion, 
denial, 
Christianity, 
medievalism, 
and 
to 
say 
to 
his 
disciples 
“it 
is 
no 
good! 
seek 
salvation 
elsewhere!” 
Even 
the 
“blood 
of 
the 
Redeemer” 
is 
invoked 
in 
one 
place.— 



4 


In 
such 
a 
case 
as 
this, 
embarrassing 
in 
many 
ways, 
my 
view 
is—and 
it 
is 
a 
typical 
case—that 
one 
does 
best 
to 
separate 
an 
artist 
from 
his 
work, 
not 
taking 
him 
as 
seriously 
as 
his 
work. 
He 
is, 
after 
all, 
only 
the 
precondition 
of 
his 
work, 
the 
womb, 
the 
soil, 
sometimes 
the 
dung 
and 
manure 
on 
which, 
out 
of 
which, 
it 
grows:—and 
therefore 
in 
most 
cases 
something 
one 
must 
forget 
if 
one 
is 
to 
enjoy 
the 
work 
itself. 
Insight 
into 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
work 
concerns 
the 
physiologists 
and 
vivisectionists 
of 
the 
spirit; 
never 
the 
aesthetic 
man, 
the 
artist! 


The 
poet 
and 
creator 
of 
Parsifal 
could 
no 
more 
be 
spared 
a 
deep, 
thorough, 
even 
frightful 
identification 
with 
and 
descent 
into 
medieval 
soul-conflicts, 
a 
hostile 
separation 
from 
all 
spiritual 
height, 
severity, 
and 
discipline, 
a 
kind 
of 
intellectual 
perversity 
(if 
I 
may 
be 
pardoned 
the 
word), 
than 
can 
a 
pregnant 
woman 
be 
spared 
the 
repellent 
and 
bizarre 
aspects 
of 
pregnancy—which, 
as 
aforesaid, 
must 
be 
forgotten 
if 
one 
is 
to 
enjoy 
the 
child. 


One 
should 
guard 
against 
confusion 
through 
psychological 
contiguity, 
to 
use 
a 
British 
term,1 
a 
confusion 
to 
which 
an 
artist 
himself 
is 
only 
too 
prone: 
as 
if 
he 
himself 
were 
what 
he 
is 
able 
to 
represent, 
conceive, 
and 
express. 
The 
fact 
is 
that 
if 
he 
were 
it, 
he 
would 
not 
represent, 
conceive, 
and 
express 
it: 
a 
Homer 
would 
not 
have 
created 
an 
Achilles 
nor 
a 
Goethe 
a 
Faust 
if 
Homer 
had 
been 
an 
Achilles 
or 
Goethe 
a 
Faust. 
Whoever 
is 
completely 
and 
wholly 
an 
artist 
is 
to 
all 
eternity 
separated 
from 
the 
“real,” 
the 
actual; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
can 
understand 
how 
he 
may 
sometimes 
weary 
to 
the 
point 
of 
desperation 
of 
the 
eternal 
“unreality” 
and 
falsity 
of 
his 
innermost 
existence— 
and 
that 
then 
he 
may 
well 
attempt 
what 
is 
most 
forbidden 
him, 
to 
lay 
hold 
of 
actuality, 
for 
once 
actually 
to 
be. 
With 
what 
success? 
That 
is 
easy 
to 
guess. 


It 
is 
the 
typical 
velleity 
of 
the 
artist: 
the 
same 
velleity 
to 
which 
the 
aged 
Wagner 
fell 
victim 
and 
for 
which 
he 
had 
to 
pay 
so 
high 
and 
fateful 
a 
price 
(it 
cost 
him 
those 
of 
his 
friends 
who 
were 
valuable). 
Finally, 
however, 
quite 
apart 
from 
this 
velleity, 
who 
would 
not 
wish 
for 
Wagner’s 
own 
sake 
that 
he 
had 
taken 
leave 
of 
us 
and 
of 
his 
art 
differently, 
not 
with 
a 
Parsifal 
but 
in 
a 
more 
triumphant 
manner, 
more 
self-confident, 
more 
Wagnerian—less 



misleading, 
less 
ambiguous 
in 
relation 
to 
his 
over-all 
intentions, 
less 
Schopenhauerian, 
less 
nihilistic? 



5 


What, 
then, 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
ascetic 
ideals? 
In 
the 
case 
of 
an 
artist, 
as 
we 
see, 
nothing 
whatever! 
… 
Or 
so 
many 
things 
it 
amounts 
to 
nothing 
whatever! 


Let 
us, 
first 
of 
all, 
eliminate 
the 
artists: 
they 
do 
not 
stand 
nearly 
independently 
enough 
in 
the 
world 
and 
against 
the 
world 
for 
their 
changing 
valuations 
to 
deserve 
attention 
in 
themselves! 
They 
have 
at 
all 
times 
been 
valets 
of 
some 
morality, 
philosophy, 
or 
religion; 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
have 
unfortunately 
often 
been 
all-too-pliable 
courtiers 
of 
their 
own 
followers 
and 
patrons, 
and 
cunning 
flatterers 
of 
ancient 
or 
newly 
arrived 
powers. 
They 
always 
need 
at 
the 
very 
least 
protection, 
a 
prop, 
an 
established 
authority: 
artists 
never 
stand 
apart; 
standing 
alone 
is 
contrary 
to 
their 
deepest 
instincts. 


Thus 
Richard 
Wagner, 
for 
example, 
used 
the 
philosopher 
Schopenhauer, 
when 
the 
latter’s 
“time 
had 
come,” 
as 
his 
herald 
and 
protection: 
who 
would 
regard 
it 
as 
even 
thinkable 
that 
he 
would 
have 
had 
the 
courage 
for 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
without 
the 
prop 
provided 
by 
Schopenhauer’s 
philosophy, 
without 
the 
authority 
of 
Schopenhauer 
which 
had 
gained 
ascendancy 
in 
Europe 
during 
the 
seventies? 
(Let 
us 
leave 
out 
of 
account 
whether 
in 
the 
new 
Germany 
an 
artist 
could 
have 
existed 
who 
lacked 
the 
milk 
of 
pious, 
Reichs-pious 
sentiments). 


Here 
we 
have 
arrived 
at 
the 
more 
serious 
question: 
what 
does 
it 
mean 
when 
a 
genuine 
philosopher 
pays 
homage 
to 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
a 
genuinely 
independent 
spirit 
like 
Schopenhauer, 
a 
man 
and 
knight 
of 
a 
steely 
eye 
who 
had 
the 
courage 
to 
be 
himself, 
who 
knew 
how 
to 
stand 
alone 
without 
first 
waiting 
for 
heralds 
and 
signs 
from 
above? 


Let 
us 
here 
consider 
straightaway 
the 
remarkable 
and 
for 
many 
kinds 
of 
men 
even 
fascinating 
attitude 
Schopenhauer 
adopted 
toward 
art: 
for 
it 
was 
obviously 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
this 
that 
Richard 
Wagner 
initially 
went 
over 
to 
Schopenhauer 
(persuaded, 
as 
one 
knows, 
by 
a 
poet, 
by 
Herwegh1), 
and 
did 
so 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
complete 
theoretical 
contradiction 
between 
his 
earlier 
and 
his 
later 
aesthetic 
creed—the 
former 
set 
down, 
for 
example, 
in 
Opera 
and 
Drama, 
the 
latter 
in 
the 
writings 
he 
published 
from 



1870 
onward. 
Specifically, 
he 
ruthlessly 
altered—and 
this 
is 
perhaps 
most 
astonishing—his 
judgment 
as 
to 
the 
value 
and 
status 
of 
music: 
what 
did 
he 
care 
that 
he 
had 
formerly 
made 
of 
music 
a 
means, 
a 
medium, 
a 
“woman” 
who 
required 
a 
goal, 
a 
man, 
in 
order 
to 
prosper—namely, 
drama! 
He 
grasped 
all 
at 
once 
that 
with 
the 
Schopenhauerian 
theory 
and 
innovation 
more 
could 
be 
done 
in 
majorem 
musicae 
gloriam2 


—namely, 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
music 
as 
Schopenhauer 
conceived 
it: 
music 
set 
apart 
from 
all 
the 
other 
arts, 
the 
independent 
art 
as 
such, 
not 
offering 
images 
of 
phenomenality, 
as 
the 
other 
arts 
did, 
but 
speaking 
rather 
the 
language 
of 
the 
will 
itself, 
directly 
out 
of 
the 
“abyss” 
as 
its 
most 
authentic, 
elemental, 
nonderivative 
revelation. 
With 
this 
extraordinary 
rise 
in 
the 
value 
of 
music 
that 
appeared 
to 
follow 
from 
Schopenhauerian 
philosophy, 
the 
value 
of 
the 
musician 
himself 
all 
at 
once 
went 
up 
in 
an 
unheard-of 
manner, 
too: 
from 
now 
on 
he 
became 
an 
oracle, 
a 
priest, 
indeed 
more 
than 
a 
priest, 
a 
kind 
of 
mouthpiece 
of 
the 
“in 
itself” 
of 
things, 
a 
telephone 
from 
the 
beyond—henceforth 
he 
uttered 
not 
only 
music, 
this 
ventriloquist 
of 
God—he 
uttered 
metaphysics: 
no 
wonder 
he 
one 
day 
finally 
uttered 
ascetic 
ideals: 



6 


Schopenhauer 
made 
use 
of 
the 
Kantian 
version 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
problem— 
although 
he 
certainly 
did 
not 
view 
it 
with 
Kantian 
eyes. 
Kant 
thought 
he 
was 
honoring 
art 
when 
among 
the 
predicates 
of 
beauty 
he 
emphasized 
and 
gave 
prominence 
to 
those 
which 
establish 
the 
honor 
of 
knowledge: 
impersonality 
and 
universality. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
inquire 
whether 
this 
was 
essentially 
a 
mistake; 
all 
I 
wish 
to 
underline 
is 
that 
Kant, 
like 
all 
philosophers, 
instead 
of 
envisaging 
the 
aesthetic 
problem 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
artist 
(the 
creator), 
considered 
art 
and 
the 
beautiful 
purely 
from 
that 
of 
the 
“spectator,” 
and 
unconsciously 
introduced 
the 
“spectator” 
into 
the 
concept 
“beautiful.” 
It 
would 
not 
have 
been 
so 
bad 
if 
this 
“spectator” 
had 
at 
least 
been 
sufficiently 
familiar 
to 
the 
philosophers 
of 
beauty—namely, 
as 
a 
great 
personal 
fact 
and 
experience, 
as 
an 
abundance 
of 
vivid 
authentic 
experiences, 
desires, 
surprises, 
and 
delights 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
beautiful! 
But 
I 
fear 
that 
the 
reverse 
has 
always 
been 
the 
case; 
and 
so 
they 
have 
offered 
us, 
from 
the 
beginning, 
definitions 
in 
which, 
as 
in 
Kant’s 
famous 
definition 
of 
the 
beautiful, 
a 
lack 
of 
any 
refined 
first-hand 
experience 
reposes 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
fat 
worm 
of 
error. 
“That 
is 
beautiful,” 
said 
Kant,1 


“which 
gives 
us 
pleasure 
without 
interest.” 
Without 
interest! 
Compare 
with 
this 
definition 
one 
framed 
by 
a 
genuine 
“spectator” 
and 
artist—Stendhal, 
who 
once 
called 
the 
beautiful 
une 
promesse 
de 
bonheur.2 


At 
any 
rate 
he 
rejected 
and 
repudiated 
the 
one 
point 
about 
the 
aesthetic 
condition 
which 
Kant 
had 
stressed: 
le 
désintéressement. 
Who 
is 
right, 
Kant 
or 
Stendhal? 


If 
our 
aestheticians 
never 
weary 
of 
asserting 
in 
Kant’s 
favor 
that,/under 
the 
spell 
of 
beauty, 
one 
can 
even 
view 
undraped 
female 
statues 
“without 
interest,” 
one 
may 
laugh 
a 
little 
at 
their 
expense: 
the 
experiences 
of 
artists 
on 
this 
ticklish 
point 
are 
more 
“interesting,” 
and 
Pygmalion 
was 
in 
any 
event 
not 
necessarily 
an 
“unaesthetic 
man.” 
Let 
us 
think 
the 
more 
highly 
of 
the 
innocence 
of 
our 
aestheticians 
which 
is 
reflected 
in 
such 
arguments; 
let 
us, 
for 
example, 
credit 
it 
to 
the 
honor 
of 
Kant 
that 
he 
should 
expatiate 
on 
the 
peculiar 
properties 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
touch 
with 
the 
naïveté 
of 
a 
country 
parson! 



And 
here 
we 
come 
back 
to 
Schopenhauer, 
who 
stood 
much 
closer 
to 
the 
arts 
than 
Kant 
and 
yet 
did 
not 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
spell 
of 
the 
Kantian 
definition: 
how 
did 
that 
happen? 
The 
circumstance 
is 
remarkable 
enough: 
he 
interpreted 
the 
term 
“without 
interest” 
in 
an 
extremely 
personal 
way, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
one 
of 
his 
most 
regular 
experiences. 


Of 
few 
things 
does 
Schopenhauer 
speak 
with 
greater 
assurance 
than 
he 
does 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
aesthetic 
contemplation: 
he 
says 
of 
it 
that 
it 
counteracts 
sexual 
“interestedness,” 
like 
lupulin 
and 
camphor; 
he 
never 
wearied 
of 
glorifying 
this 
liberation 
from 
the 
“will” 
as 
the 
great 
merit 
and 
utility 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
condition. 
Indeed, 
one 
might 
be 
tempted 
to 
ask 
whether 
his 
basic 
conception 
of 
“will 
and 
representation,” 
the 
thought 
that 
redemption 
from 
the 
“will” 
could 
be 
attained 
only 
through 
“representation,” 
did 
not 
originate 
as 
a 
generalization 
from 
this 
sexual 
experience. 
(In 
all 
questions 
concerning 
Schopenhauer’s 
philosophy, 
by 
the 
way, 
one 
should 
never 
forget 
that 
it 
was 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
young 
man 
of 
twenty-six; 
so 
that 
it 
partakes 
not 
only 
of 
the 
specific 
qualities 
of 
Schopenhauer, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
specific 
qualities 
of 
that 
period 
of 
life.) 
Listen, 
for 
instance, 
to 
one 
of 
the 
most 
explicit 
of 
the 
countless 
passages 
he 
has 
written 
in 
praise 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
condition 
(World 
as 
Will 
and 
Representation, 
I, 
p. 
2313); 
listen 
to 
the 
tone, 
the 
suffering, 
the 
happiness, 
the 
gratitude 
expressed 
in 
such 
words. 


“This 
is 
the 
painless 
condition 
that 
Epicurus 
praised 
as 
the 
highest 
good 
and 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
gods; 
for 
a 
moment 
we 
are 
delivered 
from 
the 
vile 
urgency 
of 
the 
will; 
we 
celebrate 
the 
Sabbath 
of 
the 
penal 
servitude 
of 
volition; 
the 
wheel 
of 
Ixion 
stands 
still!” 


What 
vehemence 
of 
diction! 
What 
images 
of 
torment 
and 
long 
despair! 
What 
an 
almost 
pathological 
antithesis 
between 
“a 
moment” 
and 
the 
usual 
“wheel 
of 
Ixion,” 
“penal 
servitude 
of 
volition,” 
and 
“vile 
urgency 
of 
the 
will!”— 
But 
even 
if 
Schopenhauer 
was 
a 
hundred 
times 
right 
in 
his 
own 
case, 
what 
insight 
does 
that 
give 
us 
into 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
beautiful? 
Schopenhauer 
described 
one 
effect 
of 
the 
beautiful, 
its 
calming 
effect 
on 
the 
will—but 
is 
this 
a 
regular 
effect? 
Stendhal, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
a 
no 
less 
sensual 
but 
more 
happily 
constituted 
person 
than 
Schopenhauer, 
emphasizes 
another 
effect 
of 
the 
beautiful: 
“the 
beautiful 
promises 
happiness”; 
to 
him 
the 
fact 
seems 
to 
be 
precisely 
that 
the 
beautiful 
arouses 
the 
will 
(“interestedness”). 
And 
could 
one 
not 
finally 
urge 
against 
Schopenhauer 
himself 
that 
he 
was 
quite 
wrong 
in 
thinking 
himself 
a 
Kantian 
in 
this 
matter, 
that 
he 
by 
no 
means 
understood 
the 
Kantian 
definition 
of 
the 
beautiful 
in 
a 
Kantian 
sense—that 
he, 
too, 
was 



pleased 
by 
the 
beautiful 
from 
an 
“interested” 
viewpoint, 
even 
from 
the 
very 
strongest, 
most 
personal 
interest: 
that 
of 
a 
tortured 
man 
who 
gains 
release 
from 
his 
torture?— 
And, 
to 
return 
to 
our 
first 
question, 
“what 
does 
it 
mean 
when 
a 
philosopher 
pays 
homage 
to 
the 
ascetic 
ideal?”—here 
we 
get 
at 
any 
rate 
a 
first 
indication: 
he 
wants 
to 
gain 
release 
from 
a 
torture.— 



7 


Let 
us 
not 
become 
gloomy 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
hear 
the 
word 
“torture”: 
in 
this 
particular 
case 
there 
is 
plenty 
to 
offset 
and 
mitigate 
that 
word—even 
something 
to 
laugh 
at. 
Above 
all, 
we 
should 
not 
underestimate 
the 
fact 
that 
Schopenhauer, 
who 
treated 
sexuality 
as 
a 
personal 
enemy 
(including 
its 
tool, 
woman, 
that 
“instrumentum 
diaboli”1), 
needed 
enemies 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
in 
good 
spirits; 
that 
he 
loved 
bilious, 
black-green 
words, 
that 
he 
scolded 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
scolding, 
out 
of 
passion; 
that 
he 
would 
have 
become 
ill, 
become 
a 
pessimist 
(for 
he 
was 
not 
one, 
however 
much 
he 
desired 
it), 
if 
deprived 
of 
his 
enemies, 
of 
Hegel, 
of 
woman, 
of 
sensuality 
and 
the 
whole 
will 
to 
existence, 
to 
persistence. 
Without 
these, 
Schopenhauer 
would 
not 
have 
persisted, 
one 
may 
wager 
on 
that; 
he 
would 
have 
run 
away: 
but 
his 
enemies 
held 
him 
fast, 
his 
enemies 
seduced 
him 
ever 
again 
to 
existence; 
his 
anger 
was, 
just 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Cynics 
of 
antiquity, 
his 
balm, 
his 
refreshment, 
his 
reward, 
his 
specific 
against 
disgust, 
his 
happiness. 
So 
much 
in 
regard 
to 
what 
is 
most 
personal 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Schopenhauer; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
is 
also 
something 
typical 
in 
him—and 
here 
we 
finally 
come 
back 
to 
our 
problem. 


As 
long 
as 
there 
are 
philosophers 
on 
earth, 
and 
wherever 
there 
have 
been 
philosophers 
(from 
India 
to 
England, 
to 
take 
the 
antithetical 
poles 
of 
philosophical 
endowment), 
there 
unquestionably 
exists 
a 
peculiar 
philosophers’ 
irritation 
at 
and 
rancor 
against 
sensuality: 
Schopenhauer 
is 
merely 
its 
most 
eloquent 
and, 
if 
one 
has 
ears 
for 
this, 
most 
ravishing 
and 
delightful 
expression. 
There 
also 
exists 
a 
peculiar 
philosophers’ 
prejudice 
and 
affection 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
whole 
ascetic 
ideal; 
one 
should 
not 
overlook 
that. 
Both, 
to 
repeat, 
pertain 
to 
the 
type; 
if 
both 
are 
lacking 
in 
a 
philosopher, 
then 
—one 
can 
be 
sure 
of 
it—he 
is 
always 
only 
a 
“so-called” 
philosopher. 
What 
does 
that 
mean? 
For 
this 
fact 
has 
to 
be 
interpreted: 
in 
itself 
it 
just 
stands 
there, 
stupid 
to 
all 
eternity, 
like 
every 
“thing-in-itself.” 


Every 
animal—therefore 
la 
bête 
philosophe,2 
too—instinctively 
strives 
for 
an 
optimum 
of 
favorable 
conditions 
under 
which 
it 
can 
expend 
all 
its 
strength 
and 
achieve 
its 
maximal 
feeling 
of 
power; 
every 
animal 
abhors, 
just 
as 
instinctively 
and 
with 
a 
subtlety 
of 
discernment 
that 
is 
“higher 
than 
all 



reason,” 
every 
kind 
of 
intrusion 
or 
hindrance 
that 
obstructs 
or 
could 
obstruct 
this 
path 
to 
the 
optimum 
(I 
am 
not 
speaking 
of 
its 
path 
to 
happiness, 
but 
its 
path 
to 
power, 
to 
action, 
to 
the 
most 
powerful 
activity, 
and 
in 
most 
cases 
actually 
its 
path 
to 
unhappiness). 
Thus 
the 
philosopher 
abhors 
marriage, 
together 
with 
that 
which 
might 
persuade 
to 
it—marriage 
being 
a 
hindrance 
and 
calamity 
on 
his 
path 
to 
the 
optimum. 
What 
great 
philosopher 
hitherto 
has 
been 
married? 
Heraclitus, 
Plato, 
Descartes, 
Spinoza, 
Leibniz, 
Kant, 
Schopenhauer—they 
were 
not; 
more, 
one 
cannot 
even 
imagine 
them 
married. 
A 
married 
philosopher 
belongs 
in 
comedy, 
that 
is 
my 
proposition—and 
as 
for 
that 
exception, 
Socrates3 


—the 
malicious 
Socrates, 
it 
would 
seem, 
married 
ironically, 
just 
to 
demonstrate 
this 
proposition. 


Every 
philosopher 
would 
speak 
as 
Buddha 
did 
when 
he 
was 
told 
of 
the 
birth 
of 
a 
son: 
“Rahula 
has 
been 
born 
to 
me, 
a 
fetter 
has 
been 
forged 
for 
me” 
(Rahula 
here 
means 
“a 
little 
demon”); 
every 
“free 
spirit” 
would 
experience 
a 
thoughtful 
moment, 
supposing 
he 
had 
previously 
experienced 
a 
thoughtless 
one, 
of 
the 
kind 
that 
once 
came 
to 
the 
same 
Buddha—“narrow 
and 
oppressive,” 
he 
thought 
to 
himself, 
“is 
life 
in 
a 
house, 
a 
place 
of 
impurity; 
freedom 
lies 
in 
leaving 
the 
house”: 
“thinking 
thus, 
he 
left 
the 
house.” 
Ascetic 
ideals 
reveal 
so 
many 
bridges 
to 
independence 
that 
a 
philosopher 
is 
bound 
to 
rejoice 
and 
clap 
his 
hands 
when 
he 
hears 
the 
story 
of 
all 
those 
resolute 
men 
who 
one 
day 
said 
No 
to 
all 
servitude 
and 
went 
into 
some 
desert: 
even 
supposing 
they 
were 
merely 
strong 
asses 
and 
quite 
the 
reverse 
of 
a 
strong 
spirit. 


What, 
then, 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
philosopher? 
My 
answer 
is—you 
will 
have 
guessed 
it 
long 
ago: 
the 
philosopher 
sees 
in 
it 
an 
optimum 
condition 
for 
the 
highest 
and 
boldest 
spirituality 
and 
smiles—he 
does 
not 
deny 
“existence,” 
he 
rather 
affirms 
his 
existence 
and 
only 
his 
existence, 
and 
this 
perhaps 
to 
the 
point 
at 
which 
he 
is 
not 
far 
from 
harboring 
the 
impious 
wish: 
pereat 
mundus, 
fiat 
philosophia, 
fiat 
philosophus, 
fiam!4— 



8 


As 
you 
see, 
they 
are 
not 
unbiased 
witnesses 
and 
judges 
of 
the 
value 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
these 
philosophers! 
They 
think 
of 
themselves—what 
is 
“the 
saint” 
to 
them! 
They 
think 
of 
what 
they 
can 
least 
do 
without: 
freedom 
from 
compulsion, 
disturbance, 
noise, 
from 
tasks, 
duties, 
worries; 
clear 
heads; 
the 
dance, 
leap, 
and 
flight 
of 
ideas; 
good 
air, 
thin, 
clear, 
open, 
dry, 
like 
the 
air 
of 
the 
heights 
through 
which 
all 
animal 
being 
becomes 
more 
spiritual 
and 
acquires 
wings; 
repose 
in 
all 
cellar 
regions; 
all 
dogs 
nicely 
chained 
up; 
no 
barking 
of 
hostility 
and 
shaggy-haired 
rancor; 
no 
gnawing 
worm 
of 
injured 
ambition; 
undemanding 
and 
obedient 
intestines, 
busy 
as 
windmills 
but 
distant; 
the 
heart 
remote, 
beyond, 
heavy 
with 
future, 
posthumous—all 
in 
all, 
they 
think 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
as 
the 
cheerful 
asceticism 
of 
an 
animal 
become 
fledged 
and 
divine, 
floating 
above 
life 
rather 
than 
in 
repose. 


The 
three 
great 
slogans 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
are 
familiar: 
poverty, 
humility, 
chastity. 
Now 
take 
a 
close 
look 
at 
the 
lives 
of 
all 
the 
great, 
fruitful, 
inventive 
spirits: 
you 
will 
always 
encounter 
all 
three 
to 
a 
certain 
degree. 
Not, 
it 
goes 
without 
saying, 
as 
though 
these 
constituted 
their 
“virtues”—what 
has 
this 
kind 
of 
man 
to 
do 
with 
virtues!—but 
as 
the 
most 
appropriate 
and 
natural 
conditions 
of 
their 
best 
existence, 
their 
fairest 
fruitfulness. 
It 
is 
quite 
possible 
that 
their 
dominating 
spirituality 
had 
first 
to 
put 
a 
check 
on 
an 
unrestrained 
and 
irritable 
pride 
or 
a 
wanton 
sensuality, 
or 
that 
it 
perhaps 
had 
a 
hard 
job 
to 
maintain 
its 
will 
to 
the 
“desert” 
against 
a 
love 
of 
luxury 
and 
refinement 
or 
an 
excessive 
liberality 
of 
heart 
and 
hand. 
But 
it 
did 
it, 
precisely 
because 
it 
was 
the 
dominating 
instinct 
whose 
demands 
prevailed 
against 
those 
of 
all 
the 
other 
instincts—it 
continues 
to 
do 
it; 
if 
it 
did 
not 
do 
it, 
it 
would 
not 
dominate. 
There 
is 
thus 
nothing 
of 
“virtue” 
in 
this. 


The 
desert, 
incidentally, 
that 
I 
just 
mentioned, 
where 
the 
strong, 
independent 
spirits 
withdraw 
and 
become 
lonely—oh, 
how 
different 
it 
looks 
from 
the 
way 
educated 
people 
imagine 
a 
desert!— 
for 
in 
some 
cases 
they 
themselves 
are 
this 
desert, 
these 
educated 
people. 
And 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
no 
actor 
of 
the 
spirit 
could 
possibly 
endure 
life 
in 
it—for 
them 
it 
is 
not 
nearly 
romantic 
or 
Syrian 
enough, 
not 
nearly 
enough 
of 
a 
stage 
desert! 
To 
be 
sure, 



there 
is 
no 
lack 
of 
camels1 
in 
it; 
but 
that 
is 
where 
the 
similarity 
ends. 
A 
voluntary 
obscurity 
perhaps; 
an 
avoidance 
of 
oneself; 
a 
dislike 
of 
noise, 
honor, 
newspapers, 
influence; 
a 
modest 
job, 
an 
everyday 
job, 
something 
that 
conceals 
rather 
than 
exposes 
one; 
an 
occasional 
association 
with 
harmless, 
cheerful 
beasts 
and 
birds 
whose 
sight 
is 
refreshing; 
mountains 
for 
company, 
but 
not 
dead 
ones, 
mountains 
with 
eyes 
(that 
is, 
with 
lakes); 
perhaps 
even 
a 
room 
in 
a 
full, 
utterly 
commonplace 
hotel, 
where 
one 
is 
certain 
to 
go 
unrecognized 
and 
can 
talk 
to 
anyone 
with 
impunity—that 
is 
what 
“desert” 
means 
here: 
oh, 
it 
is 
lonely 
enough, 
believe 
me! 
When 
Heraclitus 
withdrew 
into 
the 
courtyards 
and 
colonnades 
of 
the 
great 
temple 
of 
Artemis, 
this 
was 
a 
worthier 
“desert,” 
I 
admit: 
why 
do 
we 
lack 
such 
temples? 
(Perhaps 
we 
do 
not 
lack 
them: 
I 
just 
recall 
my 
most 
beautiful 
study—the 
Piazza 
di 
San 
Marco, 
in 
spring 
of 
course, 
and 
morning 
also, 
the 
time 
between 
ten 
and 
twelve.) 
That 
which 
Heraclitus 
avoided, 
however, 
is 
still 
the 
same 
as 
that 
which 
we 
shun 
today: 
the 
noise 
and 
democratic 
chatter 
of 
the 
Ephesians, 
their 
politics, 
their 
latest 
news 
of 
the 
“Empire”2 


(the 
Persian, 
you 
understand), 
their 
market 
business 
of 
“today”—for 
we 
philosophers 
need 
to 
be 
spared 
one 
thing 
above 
all: 
everything 
to 
do 
with 
“today.” 
We 
reverence 
what 
is 
still, 
cold, 
noble, 
distant, 
past, 
and 
in 
general 
everything 
in 
the 
face 
of 
which 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
have 
to 
defend 
itself 
and 
wrap 
itself 
up—what 
one 
can 
speak 
to 
without 
speaking 
aloud. 


One 
should 
listen 
to 
how 
a 
spirit 
sounds 
when 
it 
speaks: 
every 
spirit 
has 
its 
own 
sound 
and 
loves 
its 
own 
sound. 
That 
one, 
over 
there, 
for 
example, 
must 
be 
an 
agitator, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
hollow 
head, 
a 
hollow 
pot: 
whatever 
goes 
into 
him 
comes 
back 
out 
of 
him 
dull 
and 
thick, 
heavy 
with 
the 
echo 
of 
great 
emptiness. 
This 
fellow 
usually 
speaks 
hoarsely: 
has 
he 
perhaps 
thought 
himself 
hoarse? 
That 
might 
be 
possible—ask 
any 
physiologist—but 
whoever 
thinks 
in 
words 
thinks 
as 
an 
orator 
and 
not 
as 
a 
thinker 
(it 
shows 
that 
fundamentally 
he 
does 
not 
think 
facts, 
nor 
factually, 
but 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
facts; 
that 
he 
is 
really 
thinking 
of 
himself 
and 
his 
listeners). 
A 
third 
person 
speaks 
importunately, 
he 
comes 
too 
close 
to 
us, 
he 
breathes 
on 
us— 
involuntarily 
we 
close 
our 
mouths, 
although 
it 
is 
a 
book 
through 
which 
he 
is 
speaking 
to 
us: 
the 
sound 
of 
his 
style 
betrays 
the 
reason: 
he 
has 
no 
time 
to 
waste, 
he 
has 
little 
faith 
in 
himself, 
he 
must 
speak 
today 
or 
never. 
A 
spirit 
that 
is 
sure 
of 
itself, 
however, 
speaks 
softly; 
it 
seeks 
concealment, 
it 
keeps 
people 
waiting. 


A 
philosopher 
may 
be 
recognized 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
avoids 
three 
glittering 



and 
loud 
things: 
fame, 
princes, 
and 
women—which 
is 
not 
to 
say 
they 
do 
not 
come 
to 
him. 
He 
shuns 
light 
that 
is 
too 
bright: 
that 
is 
why 
he 
shuns 
his 
age 
and 
its 
“day.” 
In 
this 
he 
is 
like 
a 
shadow: 
the 
lower 
his 
sun 
sinks 
the 
bigger 
he 
becomes. 
As 
for 
his 
“humility,” 
he 
endures 
a 
certain 
dependence 
and 
eclipse, 
as 
he 
endures 
the 
darkness: 
more, 
he 
is 
afraid 
of 
being 
distracted 
by 
lightning, 
he 
shies 
away 
from 
the 
unprotected 
isolation 
of 
abandoned 
trees 
upon 
which 
any 
bad 
weather 
can 
vent 
its 
moods, 
any 
mood 
its 
bad 
weather. 
His 
“maternal” 
instinct, 
the 
secret 
love 
of 
that 
which 
is 
growing 
in 
him, 
directs 
him 
toward 
situations 
in 
which 
he 
is 
relieved 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
thinking 
of 
himself; 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
in 
which 
the 
instinct 
of 
the 
mother 
in 
woman 
has 
hitherto 
generally 
kept 
woman 
in 
a 
dependent 
situation. 
Ultimately 
they 
ask 
for 
little 
enough, 
these 
philosophers: 
their 
motto 
is 
“he 
who 
possesses 
is 
possessed”—not, 
as 
I 
must 
say 
again 
and 
again, 
from 
virtue, 
from 
a 
laudable 
will 
to 
contentment 
and 
simplicity, 
but 
because 
their 
supreme 
lord 
demands 
this 
of 
them, 
prudently 
and 
inexorably: 
he 
is 
concerned 
with 
one 
thing 
alone, 
and 
assembles 
and 
saves 
up 
everything—time, 
energy, 
love, 
and 
interest—only 
for 
that 
one 
thing. 


This 
kind 
of 
man 
does 
not 
like 
to 
be 
disturbed 
by 
enmities, 
nor 
by 
friendships; 
he 
easily 
forgets 
and 
easily 
despises. 
He 
thinks 
it 
in 
bad 
taste 
to 
play 
the 
martyr; 
“to 
suffer 
for 
truth”—he 
leaves 
that 
to 
the 
ambitious 
and 
the 
stage 
heroes 
of 
the 
spirit 
and 
to 
anyone 
else 
who 
has 
the 
time 
for 
it 
(the 
philosophers 
themselves 
have 
something 
to 
do 
for 
the 
truth). 
They 
use 
big 
words 
sparingly; 
it 
is 
said 
that 
they 
dislike 
the 
very 
word 
“truth”: 
it 
sounds 
too 
grandiloquent. 


As 
for 
the 
“chastity” 
of 
philosophers, 
finally, 
this 
type 
of 
spirit 
clearly 
has 
its 
fruitfulness 
somewhere 
else 
than 
in 
children; 
perhaps 
it 
also 
has 
the 
survival 
of 
its 
name 
elsewhere, 
its 
little 
immortality 
(philosophers 
in 
ancient 
India 
expressed 
themselves 
even 
more 
immodestly: 
“why 
should 
he 
desire 
progeny 
whose 
soul 
is 
the 
world?”). 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
this 
of 
chastity 
from 
any 
kind 
of 
ascetic 
scruple 
or 
hatred 
of 
the 
senses, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
not 
chastity 
when 
an 
athlete 
or 
jockey 
abstains 
from 
women: 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
will 
of 
their 
dominating 
instinct, 
at 
least 
during 
their 
periods 
of 
great 
pregnancy. 
Every 
artist 
knows 
what 
a 
harmful 
effect 
intercourse 
has 
in 
states 
of 
great 
spiritual 
tension 
and 
preparation; 
those 
with 
the 
greatest 
power 
and 
the 
surest 
instincts 
do 
not 
need 
to 
learn 
this 
by 
experience, 
by 
unfortunate 
experience—their 
“maternal” 
instinct 
ruthlessly 
disposes 
of 
all 
other 
stores 
and 
accumulations 
of 
energy, 
of 
animal 
vigor, 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
evolving 
work: 
the 
greater 



energy 
then 
uses 
up 
the 
lesser. 


Now 
let 
us 
interpret 
the 
case 
of 
Schopenhauer, 
discussed 
above, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
these 
remarks: 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
beautiful 
obviously 
had 
upon 
him 
the 
effect 
of 
releasing 
the 
chief 
energy 
of 
his 
nature 
(the 
energy 
of 
contemplation 
and 
penetration), 
so 
that 
this 
exploded 
and 
all 
at 
once 
became 
the 
master 
of 
his 
consciousness. 
This 
should 
by 
no 
means 
preclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
sweetness 
and 
plenitude 
peculiar 
to 
the 
aesthetic 
state 
might 
be 
derived 
precisely 
from 
the 
ingredient 
of 
“sensuality” 
(just 
as 
the 
“idealism” 
of 
adolescent 
girls 
derives 
from 
this 
source)—so 
that 
sensuality 
is 
not 
overcome 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
aesthetic 
condition, 
as 
Schopenhauer 
believed, 
but 
only 
transfigured 
and 
no 
longer 
enters 
consciousness 
as 
sexual 
excitement. 
(I 
shall 
return 
to 
this 
point 
on 
another 
occasion, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
still 
more 
delicate 
problems 
of 
the 
physiology 
of 
aesthetics,3 
which 
is 
practically 
untouched 
and 
unexplored 
so 
far.)

We 
have 
seen 
how 
a 
certain 
asceticism, 
a 
severe 
and 
cheerful 
continence 
with 
the 
best 
will, 
belongs 
to 
the 
most 
favorable 
conditions 
of 
supreme 
spirituality, 
and 
is 
also 
among 
its 
most 
natural 
consequences: 
hence 
it 
need 
be 
no 
matter 
for 
surprise 
that 
philosophers 
have 
always 
discussed 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
with 
a 
certain 
fondness. 
A 
serious 
examination 
of 
history 
actually 
reveals 
that 
the 
bond 
between 
philosophy 
and 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
is 
even 
much 
closer 
and 
stronger. 
One 
might 
assert 
that 
it 
was 
only 
on 
the 
leading-strings 
of 
this 
ideal 
that 
philosophy 
learned 
to 
take 
its 
first 
small 
steps 
on 
earth— 
alas, 
so 
clumsily, 
so 
unwillingly, 
so 
ready 
to 
fall 
on 
its 
face 
and 
lie 
on 
its 
belly, 
this 
timid 
little 
toddler 
and 
mollycoddle 
with 
shaky 
legs! 


Philosophy 
began 
as 
all 
good 
things 
begin: 
for 
a 
long 
time 
it 
lacked 
the 
courage 
for 
itself; 
it 
was 
always 
looking 
round 
to 
see 
if 
someone 
would 
come 
and 
help 
it; 
yet 
it 
was 
afraid 
of 
all 
who 
looked 
at 
it. 
Draw 
up 
a 
list 
of 
the 
various 
propensities 
and 
virtues 
of 
the 
philosopher—his 
bent 
to 
doubt, 
his 
bent 
to 
deny, 
his 
bent 
to 
suspend 
judgment 
(his 
“ephectic” 
bent), 
his 
bent 
to 
analyze, 
his 
bent 
to 
investigate, 
seek, 
dare, 
his 
bent 
to 
compare 
and 
balance, 
his 
will 
to 
neutrality 
and 
objectivity, 
his 
will 
to 
every 
“sine 
ira 
et 
studio”:1 
is 
it 
not 
clear 
that 
for 
the 
longest 
time 
all 
of 
them 
contravened 
the 
basic 
demands 
of 
morality 
and 
conscience 
(not 
to 
speak 
of 
reason 
quite 
generally, 
which 
Luther 
liked 
to 
call 
“Mistress 
Clever, 
the 
clever 
whore”)—that 
if 
a 
philosopher 
had 
been 
conscious 
of 
what 
he 
was, 
he 
would 
have 
been 
compelled 
to 
feel 
himself 
the 
embodiment 
of 
“nitimur 
in 
vetitum”2 


—and 
consequently 
guarded 
against 
“feeling 
himself,” 
against 
becoming 
conscious 
of 
himself? 


It 
is, 
to 
repeat, 
no 
different 
with 
all 
the 
good 
things 
of 
which 
we 
are 
proud 
today; 
measured 
even 
by 
the 
standards 
of 
the 
ancient 
Greeks, 
our 
entire 
modern 
way 
of 
life, 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
not 
weakness 
but 
power 
and 
consciousness 
of 
power, 
has 
the 
appearance 
of 
sheer 
hubris3 
and 
godlessness: 
for 
the 
longest 
time 
it 
was 
precisely 
the 
reverse 
of 
those 
things 
we 
hold 
in 
honor 
today 
that 
had 
a 
good 
conscience 
on 
its 
side 
and 
God 
for 
its 
guardian. 
Our 
whole 
attitude 
toward 
nature, 
the 
way 
we 
violate 
her 
with 
the 
aid 
of 



machines 
and 
the 
heedless 
inventiveness 
of 
our 
technicians 
and 
engineers, 
is 
hubris; 
our 
attitude 
toward 
God 
as 
some 
alleged 
spider 
of 
purpose 
and 
morality 
behind 
the 
great 
captious 
web 
of 
causality, 
is 
hubris—we 
might 
say, 
with 
Charles 
the 
Bold 
when 
he 
opposed 
Louis 
XI, 
“je 
combats 
l’universelle 
araignée”;4 
our 
attitude 
toward 
ourselves 
is 
hubris, 
for 
we 
experiment 
with 
ourselves 
in 
a 
way 
we 
would 
never 
permit 
ourselves 
to 
experiment 
with 
animals 
and, 
carried 
away 
by 
curiosity, 
we 
cheerfully 
vivisect 
our 
souls: 
what 
is 
the 
“salvation” 
of 
the 
soul 
to 
us 
today? 
Afterward 
we 
cure 
ourselves: 
sickness 
is 
instructive, 
we 
have 
no 
doubt 
of 
that, 
even 
more 
instructive 
than 
health—those 
who 
make 
sick 
seem 
even 
more 
necessary 
to 
us 
today 
than 
any 
medicine 
men 
or 
“saviors.” 
We 
violate 
ourselves 
nowadays, 
no 
doubt 
of 
it, 
we 
nutcrackers 
of 
the 
soul, 
ever 
questioning 
and 
questionable, 
as 
if 
life 
were 
nothing 
but 
cracking 
nuts; 
and 
thus 
we 
are 
bound 
to 
grow 
day-by-day 
more 
questionable, 
worthier 
of 
asking 
questions;5 
perhaps 
also 
worthier—of 
living? 


All 
good 
things 
were 
formerly 
bad 
things; 
every 
original 
sin 
has 
turned 
into 
an 
original 
virtue. 
Marriage, 
for 
example, 
seemed 
for 
a 
long 
time 
a 
transgression 
against 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
community; 
one 
had 
to 
make 
reparation 
for 
being 
so 
immodest 
as 
to 
claim 
a 
woman 
for 
oneself 
(hence, 
for 
example, 
the 
jus 
primae 
noctis,6 
which 
in 
Cambodia 
is 
still 
the 
prerogative 
of 
the 
priests, 
those 
guardians 
of 
all 
“hallowed 
customs”). 
The 
gentle, 
benevolent, 
conciliatory, 
and 
compassionate 
feelings—eventually 
so 
highly 
valued 
that 
they 
almost 
constitute 
“the 
eternal 
values”—were 
opposed 
for 
the 
longest 
time 
by 
self-contempt: 
one 
was 
ashamed 
of 
mildness 
as 
one 
is 
today 
ashamed 
of 
hardness 
(cf. 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
260). 
Submission 
to 
law: 
how 
the 
consciences 
of 
noble 
tribes 
all 
over 
the 
earth 
resisted 
the 
abandonment 
of 
vendetta 
and 
were 
loath 
to 
bow 
before 
the 
power 
of 
the 
law! 
“Law” 
was 
for 
a 
long 
time 
a 
vetitum,7 
an 
outrage, 
an 
innovation; 
it 
was 
characterized 
by 
violence—it 
was 
violence 
to 
which 
one 
submitted, 
feeling 
ashamed 
of 
oneself. 
Every 
smallest 
step 
on 
earth 
has 
been 
paid 
for 
by 
spiritual 
and 
physical 
torture: 
this 
whole 
point 
of 
view, 
“that 
not 
only 
every 
progressive 
step, 
no! 
every 
step, 
movement, 
and 
change 
has 
required 
its 
countless 
martyrs,” 
sounds 
utterly 
strange 
to 
us 
today—I 
called 
attention 
to 
it 
in 
The 
Dawn, 
section 
18. 


“Nothing 
has 
been 
bought 
more 
dearly,” 
I 
say 
there, 
“than 
the 
modicum 
of 
human 
reason 
and 
feeling 
of 
freedom 
that 
are 
now 
our 
pride. 
It 
is 
this 
pride, 
however, 
that 
makes 
it 
almost 
impossible 
for 
us 
today 
to 
empathize 
with 
that 



vast 
era 
of 
the 
‘morality 
of 
mores’8 
which 
preceded 
‘world 
history’ 
as 
the 
truly 
decisive 
history 
that 
determined 
the 
character 
of 
mankind: 
when 
suffering 
was 
everywhere 
counted 
as 
a 
virtue, 
cruelty 
as 
a 
virtue, 
dissembling 
as 
a 
virtue, 
revenge 
as 
a 
virtue, 
slander 
of 
reason 
as 
a 
virtue, 
and 
when 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
well-being 
was 
counted 
as 
a 
danger, 
thirst 
for 
knowledge 
as 
a 
danger, 
peace 
as 
a 
danger, 
pity 
as 
a 
danger, 
being 
pitied 
as 
a 
disgrace, 
work 
as 
a 
disgrace, 
madness 
as 
divine, 
change 
as 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
immorality9 
and 
pregnant 
with 
disaster.” 



10 


In 
the 
same 
book 
(section 
42) 
it 
is 
explained 
under 
what 
valuation, 
what 
oppression 
of 
valuation, 
the 
earliest 
race 
of 
contemplative 
men 
had 
to 
live: 
when 
not 
feared, 
they 
were 
despised. 
Contemplation 
first 
appeared 
on 
earth 
in 
disguise, 
in 
ambiguous 
form, 
with 
an 
evil 
heart 
and 
often 
an 
anxious 
head: 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
that. 
The 
inactive, 
brooding, 
unwarlike 
element 
in 
the 
instincts 
of 
contemplative 
men 
long 
surrounded 
them 
with 
a 
profound 
mistrustfulness: 
the 
only 
way 
of 
dispelling 
it 
was 
to 
arouse 
a 
decided 
fear 
of 
oneself. 
And 
the 
ancient 
Brahmins, 
for 
instance, 
knew 
how 
to 
do 
this! 
The 
earliest 
philosophers 
knew 
how 
to 
endow 
their 
existence 
and 
appearance 
with 
a 
meaning, 
a 
basis 
and 
background, 
through 
which 
others 
might 
come 
to 
fear 
them: 
more 
closely 
considered, 
they 
did 
so 
from 
an 
even 
more 
fundamental 
need, 
namely, 
so 
as 
to 
fear 
and 
reverence 
themselves. 
For 
they 
found 
all 
the 
value 
judgments 
within 
them 
turned 
against 
them, 
they 
had 
to 
fight 
down 
every 
kind 
of 
suspicion 
and 
resistance 
against 
“the 
philosopher 
in 
them,” 
As 
men 
of 
frightful 
ages, 
they 
did 
this 
by 
using 
frightful 
means: 
cruelty 
toward 
themselves, 
inventive 
self-castigation—this 
was 
the 
principal 
means 
these 
power-hungry 
hermits 
and 
innovators 
of 
ideas 
required 
to 
overcome 
the 
gods 
and 
tradition 
in 
themselves, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
believe 
in 
their 
own 
innovations. 
I 
recall 
the 
famous 
story 
of 
King 
Vishvamitra, 
who 
through 
millennia 
of 
self-torture 
acquired 
such 
a 
feeling 
of 
power 
and 
self-confidence 
that 
he 
endeavored 
to 
build 
a 
new 
heaven—the 
uncanny 
symbol 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
and 
most 
recent 
experience 
of 
philosophers 
on 
earth: 
whoever 
has 
at 
some 
time 
built 
a 
“new 
heaven” 
has 
found 
the 
power 
to 
do 
so 
only 
in 
his 
own 
hell. 


Let 
us 
compress 
the 
facts 
into 
a 
few 
brief 
formulas: 
to 
begin 
with, 
the 
philosophic 
spirit 
always 
had 
to 
use 
as 
a 
mask 
and 
cocoon 
the 
previously 
established 
types 
of 
the 
contemplative 
man—priest, 
sorcerer, 
soothsayer, 
and 
in 
any 
case 
a 
religious 
type—in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
exist 
at 
all: 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
for 
a 
long 
time 
served 
the 
philosopher 
as 
a 
form 
in 
which 
to 
appear, 
as 
a 
precondition 
of 
existence—he 
had 
to 
represent 
it 
so 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
be 
a 
philosopher; 
he 
had 
to 
believe 
in 
it 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
represent 
it. 
The 
peculiar, 
withdrawn 
attitude 
of 
the 
philosopher, 
world-denying, 
hostile 
to 
life, 



suspicious 
of 
the 
senses, 
freed 
from 
sensuality, 
which 
has 
been 
maintained 
down 
to 
the 
most 
modern 
times 
and 
has 
become 
virtually 
the 
philosopher’s 
pose 
par 
excellence—it 
is 
above 
all 
a 
result 
of 
the 
emergency 
conditions 
under 
which 
philosophy 
arose 
and 
survived 
at 
all; 
for 
the 
longest 
time 
philosophy 
would 
not 
have 
been 
possible 
at 
all 
on 
earth 
without 
ascetic 
wraps 
and 
cloak, 
without 
an 
ascetic 
self-misunderstanding. 
To 
put 
it 
vividly: 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
provided 
until 
the 
most 
modern 
times 
the 
repulsive 
and 
gloomy 
caterpillar 
form 
in 
which 
alone 
the 
philosopher 
could 
live 
and 
creep 
about. 


Has 
all 
this 
really 
altered? 
Has 
that 
many-colored 
and 
dangerous 
winged 
creature, 
the 
“spirit” 
which 
this 
caterpillar 
concealed, 
really 
been 
unfettered 
at 
last 
and 
released 
into 
the 
light, 
thanks 
to 
a 
sunnier, 
warmer, 
brighter 
world? 
Is 
there 
sufficient 
pride, 
daring, 
courage, 
self-confidence 
available 
today, 
sufficient 
will 
of 
the 
spirit, 
will 
to 
responsibility, 
freedom 
of 
will, 
for 
“the 
philosopher” 
to 
be 
henceforth—possible 
on 
earth?— 



11 


Only 
now 
that 
we 
behold 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
do 
we 
seriously 
come 
to 
grips 
with 
our 
problem: 
what 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal?—only 
now 
does 
it 
become 
“serious”: 
we 
are 
now 
face 
to 
face 
with 
the 
actual 
representative 
of 
seriousness. 
“What 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
seriousness?”—this 
even 
more 
fundamental 
question 
may 
perhaps 
be 
trembling 
on 
our 
lips 
at 
this 
point: 
a 
question 
for 
physiologists, 
of 
course, 
but 
one 
which 
we 
must 
still 
avoid 
for 
the 
moment. 
The 
ascetic 
priest 
possessed 
in 
this 
ideal 
not 
only 
his 
faith 
but 
also 
his 
will, 
his 
power, 
his 
interest. 
His 
right 
to 
exist 
stands 
or 
falls 
with 
that 
ideal: 
no 
wonder 
we 
encounter 
here 
a 
terrible 
antagonist—supposing 
we 
are 
antagonists 
of 
that 
ideal—one 
who 
fights 
for 
his 
existence 
against 
those 
who 
deny 
that 
ideal. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
inherently 
improbable 
that 
so 
interested 
an 
attitude 
toward 
our 
problem 
will 
benefit 
it: 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
will 
hardly 
provide 
the 
best 
defense 
of 
his 
ideal, 
just 
as 
a 
woman 
who 
tries 
to 
defend 
“woman 
as 
such” 
usually 
fails—and 
he 
certainly 
will 
not 
be 
the 
most 
objective 
judge 
of 
this 
controversy. 
Far 
from 
fearing 
he 
will 
confute 
us—this 
much 
is 
already 
obvious—we 
shall 
have 
to 
help 
him 
defend 
himself 
against 
us. 


The 
idea 
at 
issue 
here 
is 
the 
valuation 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
places 
on 
our 
life: 
he 
juxtaposes 
it 
(along 
with 
what 
pertains 
to 
it: 
“nature,” 
“world,” 
the 
whole 
sphere 
of 
becoming 
and 
transitoriness) 
with 
a 
quite 
different 
mode 
of 
existence 
which 
it 
opposes 
and 
excludes, 
unless 
it 
turn 
against 
itself, 
deny 
itself: 
in 
that 
case, 
the 
case 
of 
the 
ascetic 
life, 
life 
counts 
as 
a 
bridge 
to 
that 
other 
mode 
of 
existence. 
The 
ascetic 
treats 
life 
as 
a 
wrong 
road 
on 
which 
one 
must 
finally 
walk 
back 
to 
the 
point 
where 
it 
begins, 
or 
as 
a 
mistake 
that 
is 
put 
right 
by 
deeds—that 
we 
ought 
to 
put 
right: 
for 
he 
demands 
that 
one 
go 
along 
with 
him; 
where 
he 
can 
he 
compels 
acceptance 
of 
his 
evaluation 
of 
existence. 


What 
does 
this 
mean? 
So 
monstrous 
a 
mode 
of 
valuation 
stands 
inscribed 
in 
the 
history 
of 
mankind 
not 
as 
an 
exception 
and 
curiosity, 
but 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
widespread 
and 
enduring 
of 
all 
phenomena. 
Read 
from 
a 
distant 
star, 
the 
majuscule 
script 
of 
our 
earthly 
existence 
would 
perhaps 
lead 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
earth 
was 
the 
distinctively 
ascetic 
planet, 
a 
nook 
of 
disgruntled, 
arrogant, 
and 
offensive 
creatures 
filled 
with 
a 
profound 
disgust 
at 



themselves, 
at 
the 
earth, 
at 
all 
life, 
who 
inflict 
as 
much 
pain 
on 
themselves 
as 
they 
possibly 
can 
out 
of 
pleasure 
in 
inflicting 
pain—which 
is 
probably 
their 
only 
pleasure. 
For 
consider 
how 
regularly 
and 
universally 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
appears 
in 
almost 
every 
age; 
he 
belongs 
to 
no 
one 
race; 
he 
prospers 
everywhere; 
he 
emerges 
from 
every 
class 
of 
society. 
Nor 
does 
he 
breed 
and 
propagate 
his 
mode 
of 
valuation 
through 
heredity: 
the 
opposite 
is 
the 
case— 
broadly 
speaking, 
a 
profound 
instinct 
rather 
forbids 
him 
to 
propagate. 
It 
must 
be 
a 
necessity 
of 
the 
first 
order 
that 
again 
and 
again 
promotes 
the 
growth 
and 
prosperity 
of 
this 
life-inimical 
species—it 
must 
indeed 
be 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
life 
itself 
that 
such 
a 
self-contradictory 
type 
does 
not 
die 
out. 
For 
an 
ascetic 
life 
is 
a 
self-contradiction: 
here 
rules 
a 
ressentiment 
without 
equal, 
that 
of 
an 
insatiable 
instinct 
and 
power-will 
that 
wants 
to 
become 
master 
not 
over 
something 
in 
life 
but 
over 
life 
itself, 
over 
its 
most 
profound, 
powerful, 
and 
basic 
conditions; 
here 
an 
attempt 
is 
made 
to 
employ 
force 
to 
block 
up 
the 
wells 
of 
force; 
here 
physiological 
well-being 
itself 
is 
viewed 
askance, 
and 
especially 
the 
outward 
expression 
of 
this 
well-being, 
beauty 
and 
joy; 
while 
pleasure 
is 
felt 
and 
sought 
in 
ill—constitutedness, 
decay, 
pain, 
mischance, 
ugliness, 
voluntary 
deprivation, 
self-mortification, 
self-flagellation, 
self-
sacrifice. 
All 
this 
is 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
paradoxical: 
we 
stand 
before 
a 
discord 
that 
wants 
to 
be 
discordant, 
that 
enjoys 
itself 
in 
this 
suffering 
and 
even 
grows 
more 
self-confident 
and 
triumphant 
the 
more 
its 
own 
presupposition, 
its 
physiological 
capacity 
for 
life, 
decreases. 
“Triumph 
in 
the 
ultimate 
agony”: 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
always 
fought 
under 
this 
hyperbolic 
sign; 
in 
this 
enigma 
of 
seduction, 
in 
this 
image 
of 
torment 
and 
delight, 
it 
recognized 
its 
brightest 
light, 
its 
salvation, 
its 
ultimate 
victory. 
Crux, 
nux, 
lux1 


— 
for 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
these 
three 
are 
one.— 

12 


Suppose 
such 
an 
incarnate 
will 
to 
contradiction 
and 
antinaturalness 
is 
induced 
to 
philosophize: 
upon 
what 
will 
it 
vent 
its 
innermost 
contrariness? 
Upon 
what 
is 
felt 
most 
certainly 
to 
be 
real 
and 
actual: 
it 
will 
look 
for 
error 
precisely 
where 
the 
instinct 
of 
life 
most 
unconditionally 
posits 
truth. 
It 
will, 
for 
example, 
like 
the 
ascetics 
of 
the 
Vedanta 
philosophy, 
downgrade 
physicality 
to 
an 
illusion; 
likewise 
pain, 
multiplicity, 
the 
entire 
conceptual 
antithesis 
“subject” 
and 
“object”—errors, 
nothing 
but 
errors! 
To 
renounce 
belief 
in 
one’s 
ego, 
to 
deny 
one’s 
own 
“reality”—what 
a 
triumph! 
not 
merely 
over 
the 
senses, 
over 
appearance, 
but 
a 
much 
higher 
kind 
of 
triumph, 
a 
violation 
and 
cruelty 
against 
reason—a 
voluptuous 
pleasure 
that 
reaches 
its 
height 
when 
the 
ascetic 
self-contempt 
and 
self-mockery 
of 
reason 
declares: 
“there 
is 
a 
realm 
of 
truth 
and 
being, 
but 
reason 
is 
excluded 
from 
it!” 


(Incidentally, 
even 
in 
the 
Kantian 
concept 
of 
the 
“intelligible 
character 
of 
things” 
something 
remains 
of 
this 
lascivious 
ascetic 
discord 
that 
loves 
to 
turn 
reason 
against 
reason: 
for 
“intelligible 
character” 
signifies 
in 
Kant 
that 
things 
are 
so 
constituted 
that 
the 
intellect 
comprehends 
just 
enough 
of 
them 
to 
know 
that 
for 
the 
intellect 
they 
are—utterly 
incomprehensible.) 


But 
precisely 
because 
we 
seek 
knowledge, 
let 
us 
not 
be 
ungrateful 
to 
such 
resolute 
reversals 
of 
accustomed 
perspectives 
and 
valuations 
with 
which 
the 
spirit 
has, 
with 
apparent 
mischievousness 
and 
futility, 
raged 
against 
itself 
for 
so 
long: 
to 
see 
differently 
in 
this 
way 
for 
once, 
to 
want 
to 
see 
differently, 
is 
no 
small 
discipline 
and 
preparation 
of 
the 
intellect 
for 
its 
future 
“objectivity”—the 
latter 
understood 
not 
as 
“contemplation 
without 
interest” 
(which 
is 
a 
nonsensical 
absurdity), 
but 
as 
the 
ability 
to 
control 
one’s 
Pro 
and 
Con 
and 
to 
dispose 
of 
them, 
so 
that 
one 
knows 
how 
to 
employ 
a 
variety 
of 
perspectives 
and 
affective 
interpretations 
in 
the 
service 
of 
knowledge. 


Henceforth, 
my 
dear 
philosophers, 
let 
us 
be 
on 
guard 
against 
the 
dangerous 
old 
conceptual 
fiction 
that 
posited 
a 
“pure, 
will-less, 
painless, 
timeless 
knowing 
subject”; 
let 
us 
guard 
against 
the 
snares 
of 
such 
contradictory 
concepts 
as 
“pure 
reason,” 
“absolute 
spirituality,” 
“knowledge 
in 
itself”: 
these 
always 
demand 
that 
we 
should 
think 
of 
an 
eye 
that 
is 
completely 
unthinkable, 
an 
eye 
turned 
in 
no 
particular 
direction, 
in 
which 
the 
active 
and 



interpreting 
forces, 
through 
which 
alone 
seeing 
becomes 
seeing 
something, 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
lacking; 
these 
always 
demand 
of 
the 
eye 
an 
absurdity 
and 
a 
nonsense. 
There 
is 
only 
a 
perspective 
seeing, 
only 
a 
perspective 
“knowing”; 
and 
the 
more 
affects 
we 
allow 
to 
speak 
about 
one 
thing, 
the 
more 
eyes, 
different 
eyes, 
we 
can 
use 
to 
observe 
one 
thing, 
the 
more 
complete 
will 
our 
“concept” 
of 
this 
thing, 
our 
“objectivity,” 
be.1 


But 
to 
eliminate 
the 
will 
altogether, 
to 
suspend 
each 
and 
every 
affect, 
supposing 
we 
were 
capable 
of 
this—what 
would 
that 
mean 
but 
to 
castrate 
the 
intellect?— 



13 


But 
let 
us 
return 
to 
our 
problem. 
It 
will 
be 
immediately 
obvious 
that 
such 
a 
self-contradiction 
as 
the 
ascetic 
appears 
to 
represent, 
“life 
against 
life,” 
is, 
physiologically 
considered 
and 
not 
merely 
psychologically, 
a 
simple 
absurdity. 
It 
can 
only 
be 
apparent; 
it 
must 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
provisional 
formulation, 
an 
interpretation 
and 
psychological 
misunderstanding 
of 
something 
whose 
real 
nature 
could 
not 
for 
a 
long 
time 
be 
understood 
or 
described 
as 
it 
really 
was—a 
mere 
word 
inserted 
into 
an 
old 
gap 
in 
human 
knowledge. 
Let 
us 
replace 
it 
with 
a 
brief 
formulation 
of 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
matter: 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
springs 
from 
the 
protective 
instinct 
of 
a 
degenerating 
life 
which 
tries 
by 
all 
means 
to 
sustain 
itself 
and 
to 
fight 
for 
its 
existence; 
it 
indicates 
a 
partial 
physiological 
obstruction 
and 
exhaustion 
against 
which 
the 
deepest 
instincts 
of 
life, 
which 
have 
remained 
intact, 
continually 
struggle 
with 
new 
expedients 
and 
devices. 
The 
ascetic 
ideal 
is 
such 
an 
expedient; 
the 
case 
is 
therefore 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
those 
who 
reverence 
this 
ideal 
believe: 
life 
wrestles 
in 
it 
and 
through 
it 
with 
death 
and 
against 
death; 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
is 
an 
artifice 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
life. 


That 
this 
ideal 
acquired 
such 
power 
and 
ruled 
over 
men 
as 
imperiously 
as 
we 
find 
it 
in 
history, 
especially 
wherever 
the 
civilization 
and 
taming 
of 
man 
has 
been 
carried 
through, 
expresses 
a 
great 
fact: 
the 
sickliness 
of 
the 
type 
of 
man 
we 
have 
had 
hitherto, 
or 
at 
least 
of 
the 
tamed 
man, 
and 
the 
physiological 
struggle 
of 
man 
against 
death 
(more 
precisely: 
against 
disgust 
with 
life, 
against 
exhaustion, 
against 
the 
desire 
for 
the 
“end”). 
The 
ascetic 
priest 
is 
the 
incarnate 
desire 
to 
be 
different, 
to 
be 
in 
a 
different 
place, 
and 
indeed 
this 
desire 
at 
its 
greatest 
extreme, 
its 
distinctive 
fervor 
and 
passion; 
but 
precisely 
this 
power 
of 
his 
desire 
is 
the 
chain 
that 
holds 
him 
captive 
so 
that 
he 
becomes 
a 
tool 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
more 
favorable 
conditions 
for 
being 
here 
and 
being 
man—it 
is 
precisely 
this 
power 
that 
enables 
him 
to 
persuade 
to 
existence 
the 
whole 
herd 
of 
the 
ill-constituted, 
disgruntled, 
underprivileged, 
unfortunate, 
and 
all 
who 
suffer 
of 
themselves, 
by 
instinctively 
going 
before 
them 
as 
their 
shepherd. 
You 
will 
see 
my 
point: 
this 
ascetic 
priest, 
this 
apparent 
enemy 
of 
life, 
this 
denier—precisely 
he 
is 
among 
the 
greatest 
conserving 
and 
yes



creating1 
forces 
of 
life. 


Where 
does 
it 
come 
from, 
this 
sickliness? 
For 
man 
is 
more 
sick, 
uncertain, 
changeable, 
indeterminate 
than 
any 
other 
animal, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
that— 
he 
is 
the 
sick 
animal: 
how 
has 
that 
come 
about? 
Certainly 
he 
has 
also 
dared 
more, 
done 
more 
new 
things, 
braved 
more 
and 
challenged 
fate 
more 
than 
all 
the 
other 
animals 
put 
together: 
he, 
the 
great 
experimenter 
with 
himself, 
discontented 
and 
insatiable, 
wrestling 
with 
animals, 
nature, 
and 
gods 
for 
ultimate 
dominion—he, 
still 
unvanquished, 
eternally 
directed 
toward 
the 
future, 
whose 
own 
restless 
energies 
never 
leave 
him 
in 
peace, 
so 
that 
his 
future 
digs 
like 
a 
spur 
into 
the 
flesh 
of 
every 
present—how 
should 
such 
a 
courageous 
and 
richly 
endowed 
animal 
not 
also 
be 
the 
most 
imperiled, 
the 
most 
chronically 
and 
profoundly 
sick 
of 
all 
sick 
animals? 


Man 
has 
often 
had 
enough; 
there 
are 
actual 
epidemics 
of 
having 
had 
enough 
(as 
around 
1348, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
dance 
of 
death); 
but 
even 
this 
nausea, 
this 
weariness, 
this 
disgust 
with 
himself—all 
this 
bursts 
from 
him 
with 
such 
violence 
that 
it 
at 
once 
becomes 
a 
new 
fetter. 
The 
No 
he 
says 
to 
life 
brings 
to 
light, 
as 
if 
by 
magic, 
an 
abundance 
of 
tender 
Yeses; 
even 
when 
he 
wounds 
himself, 
this 
master 
of 
destruction, 
of 
self-destruction—the 
very 
wound 
itself 
afterward 
compels 
him 
to 
live.— 



14 


The 
more 
normal 
sickliness 
becomes 
among 
men—and 
we 
cannot 
deny 
its 
normality—the 
higher 
should 
be 
the 
honor 
accorded 
the 
rare 
cases 
of 
great 
power 
of 
soul 
and 
body, 
man’s 
lucky 
hits; 
the 
more 
we 
should 
protect 
the 
well-constituted 
from 
the 
worst 
kind 
of 
air, 
the 
air 
of 
the 
sickroom. 
Is 
this 
done? 


The 
sick 
represent 
the 
greatest 
danger 
for 
the 
healthy; 
it 
is 
not 
the 
strongest 
but 
the 
weakest 
who 
spell 
disaster 
for 
the 
strong. 
Is 
this 
known? 


Broadly 
speaking, 
it 
is 
not 
fear 
of 
man 
that 
we 
should 
desire 
to 
see 
diminished; 
for 
this 
fear 
compels 
the 
strong 
to 
be 
strong, 
and 
occasionally 
terrible—it 
maintains 
the 
well-constituted 
type 
of 
man. 
What 
is 
to 
be 
feared, 
what 
has 
a 
more 
calamitous 
effect 
than 
any 
other 
calamity, 
is 
that 
man 
should 
inspire 
not 
profound 
fear 
but 
profound 
nausea; 
also 
not 
great 
fear 
but 
great 
pity. 
Suppose 
these 
two 
were 
one 
day 
to 
unite, 
they 
would 
inevitably 
beget 
one 
of 
the 
uncanniest 
monsters: 
the 
“last 
will” 
of 
man, 
his 
will 
to 
nothingness, 
nihilism. 
And 
indeed 
a 
great 
deal 
points 
to 
this 
union. 
Whoever 
can 
smell 
not 
only 
with 
his 
nose 
but 
also 
with 
his 
eyes 
and 
ears, 
scents 
almost 
everywhere 
he 
goes 
today 
something 
like 
the 
air 
of 
madhouses 
and 
hospitals 
—I 
am 
speaking, 
of 
course, 
of 
the 
cultural 
domain, 
of 
every 
kind 
of 
“Europe” 
on 
this 
earth. 
The 
sick 
are 
man’s 
greatest 
danger; 
not 
the 
evil, 
not 
the 
“beasts 
of 
prey.” 
Those 
who 
are 
failures 
from 
the 
start, 
downtrodden, 
crushed—it 
is 
they, 
the 
weakest, 
who 
must 
undermine 
life 
among 
men, 
who 
call 
into 
question 
and 
poison 
most 
dangerously 
our 
trust 
in 
life, 
in 
man, 
and 
in 
ourselves. 
Where 
does 
one 
not 
encounter 
that 
veiled 
glance 
which 
burdens 
one 
with 
a 
profound 
sadness, 
that 
inward-turned 
glance 
of 
the 
born 
failure 
which 
betrays 
how 
such 
a 
man 
speaks 
to 
himself—that 
glance 
which 
is 
a 
sigh! 
“If 
only 
I 
were 
someone 
else,” 
sighs 
this 
glance: 
“but 
there 
is 
no 
hope 
of 
that. 
I 
am 
who 
I 
am: 
how 
could 
I 
ever 
get 
free 
of 
myself? 
And 
yet—I 
am 
sick 
of 
myself!” 


It 
is 
on 
such 
soil, 
on 
swampy 
ground, 
that 
every 
weed, 
every 
poisonous 
plant 
grows, 
always 
so 
small, 
so 
hidden, 
so 
false, 
so 
saccharine. 
Here 
the 
worms 
of 
vengefulness 
and 
rancor 
swarm; 
here 
the 
air 
stinks 
of 
secrets 
and 
concealment; 
here 
the 
web 
of 
the 
most 
malicious 
of 
all 
conspiracies 
is 
being 



spun 
constantly—the 
conspiracy 
of 
the 
suffering 
against 
the 
well-constituted 
and 
victorious, 
here 
the 
aspect 
of 
the 
victorious 
is 
hated. 
And 
what 
mendaciousness 
is 
employed 
to 
disguise 
that 
this 
hatred 
is 
hatred! 
What 
a 
display 
of 
grand 
words 
and 
postures, 
what 
an 
art 
of 
“honest” 
calumny! 
These 
failures: 
what 
noble 
eloquence 
flows 
from 
their 
lips! 
How 
much 
sugary, 
slimy, 
humble 
submissiveness 
swims 
in 
their 
eyes! 
What 
do 
they 
really 
want? 
At 
least 
to 
represent 
justice, 
love, 
wisdom, 
superiority—that 
is 
the 
ambition 
of 
the 
“lowest,” 
the 
sick. 
And 
how 
skillfull 
such 
an 
ambition 
makes 
them! 
Admire 
above 
all 
the 
forger’s 
skill 
with 
which 
the 
stamp 
of 
virtue, 
even 
the 
ring, 
the 
golden-sounding 
ring 
of 
virtue, 
is 
here 
counterfeited. 
They 
monopolize 
virtue, 
these 
weak, 
hopelessly 
sick 
people, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
it: 
“we 
alone 
are 
the 
good 
and 
just,” 
they 
say, 
“we 
alone 
are 
homines 
bonae 
voluntatis.”1 


They 
walk 
among 
us 
as 
embodied 
reproaches, 
as 
warnings 
to 
us—as 
if 
health, 
well-constitutedness, 
strength, 
pride, 
and 
the 
sense 
of 
power 
were 
in 
themselves 
necessarily 
vicious 
things 
for 
which 
one 
must 
pay 
some 
day, 
and 
pay 
bitterly: 
how 
ready 
they 
themselves 
are 
at 
bottom 
to 
make 
one 
pay; 
how 
they 
crave 
to 
be 
hangmen. 
There 
is 
among 
them 
an 
abundance 
of 
the 
vengeful 
disguised 
as 
judges, 
who 
constantly 
bear 
the 
word 
“justice” 
in 
their 
mouths 
like 
poisonous 
spittle, 
always 
with 
pursed 
lips, 
always 
ready 
to 
spit 
upon 
all 
who 
are 
not 
discontented 
but 
go 
their 
way 
in 
good 
spirits. 
Nor 
is 
there 
lacking 
among 
them 
that 
most 
disgusting 
species 
of 
the 
vain, 
the 
mendacious 
failures 
whose 
aim 
is 
to 
appear 
as 
“beautiful 
souls” 
and 
who 
bring 
to 
market 
their 
deformed 
sensuality, 
wrapped 
up 
in 
verses 
and 
other 
swaddling 
clothes, 
as 
“purity 
of 
heart”: 
the 
species 
of 
moral 
masturbaters 
and 
“self-gratifiers.” 
The 
will 
of 
the 
weak 
to 
represent 
some 
form 
of 
superiority, 
their 
instinct 
for 
devious 
paths 
to 
tyranny 
over 
the 
healthy—where 
can 
it 
not 
be 
discovered, 
this 
will 
to 
power 
of 
the 
weakest! 


The 
sick 
woman 
especially: 
no 
one 
can 
excel 
her 
in 
the 
wiles 
to 
dominate, 
oppress, 
and 
tyrannize. 
The 
sick 
woman 
spares 
nothing, 
living 
or 
dead; 
she 
will 
dig 
up 
the 
most 
deeply 
buried 
things 
(the 
Bogos 
say: 
“woman 
is 
a 
hyena”). 


Examine 
the 
background 
of 
every 
family, 
every 
organization, 
every 
commonwealth: 
everywhere 
the 
struggle 
of 
the 
sick 
against 
the 
healthy—a 
silent 
struggle 
as 
a 
rule, 
with 
petty 
poisons, 
with 
pinpricks, 
with 
sly 
long-
suffering 
expressions, 
but 
occasionally 
also 
with 
that 
invalid’s 
Phariseeism 
of 
loud 
gestures 
that 
likes 
best 
to 
pose 
as 
“noble 
indignation.” 
This 
hoarse, 



indignant 
barking 
of 
sick 
dogs, 
this 
rabid 
mendaciousness 
and 
rage 
of 
“noble” 
Pharisees, 
penetrates 
even 
the 
hallowed 
halls 
of 
science 
(I 
again 
remind 
readers 
who 
have 
ears 
for 
such 
things 
of 
that 
Berlin 
apostle 
of 
revenge, 
Eugen 
Dühring, 
who 
employs 
moral 
mumbo-jumbo 
more 
indecently 
and 
repulsively 
than 
anyone 
else 
in 
Germany 
today: 
Dühring, 
the 
foremost 
moral 
bigmouth 
today—unexcelled 
even 
among 
his 
own 
ilk, 
the 
anti-
Semites). 


They 
are 
all 
men 
of 
ressentiment, 
physiologically 
unfortunate 
and 
worm-
eaten, 
a 
whole 
tremulous 
realm 
of 
subterranean 
revenge, 
inexhaustible 
and 
insatiable 
in 
outbursts 
against 
the 
fortunate 
and 
happy2 
and 
in 
masquerades 
of 
revenge 
and 
pretexts 
for 
revenge: 
when 
would 
they 
achieve 
the 
ultimate, 
subtlest, 
sublimest 
triumph 
of 
revenge? 
Undoubtedly 
if 
they 
succeeded 
in 
poisoning 
the 
consciences 
of 
the 
fortunate 
with 
their 
own 
misery, 
with 
all 
misery, 
so 
that 
one 
day 
the 
fortunate 
began 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of 
their 
good 
fortune 
and 
perhaps 
said 
one 
to 
another: 
“it 
is 
disgraceful 
to 
be 
fortunate: 
there 
is 
too 
much 
misery!” 


But 
no 
greater 
or 
more 
calamitous 
misunderstanding 
is 
possible 
than 
for 
the 
happy, 
well-constituted, 
powerful 
in 
soul 
and 
body, 
to 
begin 
to 
doubt 
their 
right 
to 
happiness 
in 
this 
fashion. 
Away 
with 
this 
“inverted 
world”! 
Away 
with 
this 
shameful 
emasculation 
of 
feeling! 
That 
the 
sick 
should 
not 
make 
the 
healthy 
sick—and 
this 
is 
what 
such 
an 
emasculation 
would 
involve 
—should 
surely 
be 
our 
supreme 
concern 
on 
earth; 
but 
this 
requires 
above 
all 
that 
the 
healthy 
should 
be 
segregated 
from 
the 
sick, 
guarded 
even 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
sick, 
that 
they 
may 
not 
confound 
themselves 
with 
the 
sick. 
Or 
is 
it 
their 
task, 
perhaps, 
to 
be 
nurses 
or 
physicians?3 


But 
no 
worse 
misunderstanding 
and 
denial 
of 
their 
task 
can 
be 
imagined: 
the 
higher 
ought 
not 
to 
degrade 
itself 
to 
the 
status 
of 
an 
instrument 
of 
the 
lower, 
the 
pathos 
of 
distance 
ought 
to 
keep 
their 
tasks 
eternally 
separate! 
Their 
right 
to 
exist, 
the 
privilege 
of 
the 
full-toned 
bell 
over 
the 
false 
and 
cracked, 
is 
a 
thousand 
times 
greater: 
they 
alone 
are 
our 
warranty 
for 
the 
future, 
they 
alone 
are 
liable 
for 
the 
future 
of 
man. 
The 
sick 
can 
never 
have 
the 
ability 
or 
obligation 
to 
do 
what 
they 
can 
do, 
what 
they 
ought 
to 
do: 
but 
if 
they 
are 
to 
be 
able 
to 
do 
what 
they 
alone 
ought 
to 
do, 
how 
can 
they 
at 
the 
same 
time 
be 
physicians, 
consolers, 
and 
“saviors” 
of 
the 
sick? 


And 
therefore 
let 
us 
have 
fresh 
air! 
fresh 
air! 
and 
keep 
clear 
of 
the 
madhouses 
and 
hospitals 
of 
culture! 
And 
therefore 
let 
us 
have 
good 
company, 
our 
company! 
Or 
solitude, 
if 
it 
must 
be! 
But 
away 
from 
the 
sickening 
fumes 



of 
inner 
corruption 
and 
the 
hidden 
rot 
of 
disease! 
… 
So 
that 
we 
may, 
at 
least 
for 
a 
while 
yet, 
guard 
ourselves, 
my 
friends, 
against 
the 
two 
worst 
contagions 
that 
may 
be 
reserved 
just 
for 
us—against 
the 
great 
nausea 
at 
man! 
against 
great 
pity 
for 
man!4 



15 


If 
one 
has 
grasped 
in 
all 
its 
profundity—and 
I 
insist 
that 
precisely 
this 
matter 
requires 
profound 
apprehension 
and 
comprehension—how 
it 
cannot 
be 
the 
task 
of 
the 
healthy 
to 
nurse 
the 
sick 
and 
to 
make 
them 
well, 
then 
one 
has 
also 
grasped 
one 
further 
necessity—the 
necessity 
of 
doctors 
and 
nurses 
who 
are 
themselves 
sick; 
and 
now 
we 
understand 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
and 
grasp 
it 
with 
both 
hands. 


We 
must 
count 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
as 
the 
predestined 
savior, 
shepherd, 
and 
advocate 
of 
the 
sick 
herd: 
only 
thus 
can 
we 
understand 
his 
tremendous 
historical 
mission. 
Dominion 
over 
the 
suffering 
is 
his 
kingdom, 
that 
is 
where 
his 
instinct 
directs 
him, 
here 
he 
possesses 
his 
distinctive 
art, 
his 
mastery, 
his 
kind 
of 
happiness. 
He 
must 
be 
sick 
himself, 
he 
must 
be 
profoundly 
related 
to 
the 
sick—how 
else 
would 
they 
understand 
each 
other?—but 
he 
must 
also 
be 
strong, 
master 
of 
himself 
even 
more 
than 
of 
others, 
with 
his 
will 
to 
power 
intact, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
both 
trusted 
and 
feared 
by 
the 
sick, 
so 
as 
to 
be 
their 
support, 
resistance, 
prop, 
compulsion, 
taskmaster, 
tyrant, 
and 
god. 
He 
has 
to 
defend 
his 
herd—against 
whom? 
Against 
the 
healthy, 
of 
course, 
and 
also 
against 
envy 
of 
the 
healthy; 
he 
must 
be 
the 
natural 
opponent 
and 
despiser 
of 
all 
rude, 
stormy, 
unbridled, 
hard, 
violent 
beast-of-prey 
health 
and 
might. 
The 
priest 
is 
the 
first 
form 
of 
the 
more 
delicate 
animal 
that 
despises 
more 
readily 
than 
it 
hates. 
He 
will 
not 
be 
spared 
war 
with 
the 
beasts 
of 
prey, 
a 
war 
of 
cunning 
(of 
the 
“spirit”) 
rather 
than 
one 
of 
force, 
as 
goes 
without 
saying; 
to 
fight 
it 
he 
will 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
need 
to 
evolve 
a 
virtually 
new 
type 
of 
preying 
animal 
out 
of 
himself, 
or 
at 
least 
he 
will 
need 
to 
represent 
it 
—a 
new 
kind 
of 
animal 
ferocity 
in 
which 
the 
polar 
bear, 
the 
supple, 
cold, 
and 
patient 
tiger, 
and 
not 
least 
the 
fox 
seem 
to 
be 
joined 
in 
a 
unity 
at 
once 
enticing 
and 
terrifying. 
If 
need 
compels 
him, 
he 
will 
walk 
among 
the 
other 
beasts 
of 
prey 
with 
bearlike 
seriousness 
and 
feigned 
superiority, 
venerable, 
prudent, 
and 
cold, 
as 
the 
herald 
and 
mouthpiece 
of 
more 
mysterious 
powers, 
determined 
to 
sow 
this 
soil 
with 
misery, 
discord, 
and 
self-contradiction 
wherever 
he 
can 
and, 
only 
too 
certain 
of 
his 
art, 
to 
dominate 
the 
suffering 
at 
all 
times. 
He 
brings 
salves 
and 
balm 
with 
him, 
no 
doubt; 
but 
before 
he 
can 
act 
as 
a 
physician 
he 
first 
has 
to 
wound; 
when 
he 
then 
stills 
the 
pain 
of 
the 



wound 
he 
at 
the 
same 
time 
infects 
the 
wound—for 
that 
is 
what 
he 
knows 
to 
do 
best 
of 
all, 
this 
sorcerer 
and 
animal-tamer, 
in 
whose 
presence 
everything 
healthy 
necessarily 
grows 
sick, 
and 
everything 
sick 
tame. 


Indeed, 
he 
defends 
his 
sick 
herd 
well 
enough, 
this 
strange 
shepherd—he 
also 
defends 
it 
against 
itself, 
against 
the 
baseness, 
spite, 
malice, 
and 
whatever 
else 
is 
natural 
to 
the 
ailing 
and 
sick 
and 
smolders 
within 
the 
herd 
itself; 
he 
fights 
with 
cunning 
and 
severity 
and 
in 
secret 
against 
anarchy 
and 
ever-
threatening 
disintegration 
within 
the 
herd, 
in 
which 
the 
most 
dangerous 
of 
all 
explosives, 
ressentiment, 
is 
constantly 
accumulating. 
So 
to 
detonate 
this 
explosive 
that 
it 
does 
not 
blow 
up 
herd 
and 
herdsman 
is 
his 
essential 
art, 
as 
it 
is 
his 
supreme 
utility; 
if 
one 
wanted 
to 
express 
the 
value 
of 
the 
priestly 
existence 
in 
the 
briefest 
formula 
it 
would 
be: 
the 
priest 
alters 
the 
direction 
of 
ressentiment. 


For 
every 
sufferer 
instinctively 
seeks 
a 
cause 
for 
his 
suffering; 
more 
exactly, 
an 
agent; 
still 
more 
specifically, 
a 
guilty 
agent 
who 
is 
susceptible 
to 
suffering—in 
short, 
some 
living 
thing 
upon 
which 
he 
can, 
on 
some 
pretext 
or 
other, 
vent 
his 
affects, 
actually 
or 
in 
effigy: 
for 
the 
venting 
of 
his 
affects 
represents 
the 
greatest 
attempt 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
suffering 
to 
win 
relief, 
anaesthesia—the 
narcotic 
he 
cannot 
help 
desiring 
to 
deaden 
pain 
of 
any 
kind. 
This 
alone, 
I 
surmise, 
constitutes 
the 
actual 
physiological 
cause 
of 
ressentiment, 
vengefulness, 
and 
the 
like: 
a 
desire 
to 
deaden 
pain 
by 
means 
of 
affects. 
This 
cause 
is 
usually 
sought, 
quite 
wrongly 
in 
my 
view, 
in 
defensive 
retaliation, 
a 
mere 
reactive 
protective 
measure, 
a 
“reflex 
movement” 
set 
off 
by 
sudden 
injury 
or 
peril, 
such 
as 
even 
a 
beheaded 
frog 
still 
makes 
to 
shake 
off 
a 
corrosive 
acid. 
But 
the 
difference 
is 
fundamental: 
in 
the 
one 
case, 
the 
desire 
is 
to 
prevent 
any 
further 
injury, 
in 
the 
other 
it 
is 
to 
deaden, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
more 
violent 
emotion 
of 
any 
kind, 
a 
tormenting, 
secret 
pain 
that 
is 
becoming 
unendurable, 
and 
to 
drive 
it 
out 
of 
consciousness 
at 
least 
for 
the 
moment: 
for 
that 
one 
requires 
an 
affect, 
as 
savage 
an 
affect 
as 
possible, 
and, 
in 
order 
to 
excite 
that, 
any 
pretext 
at 
all. 
“Someone 
or 
other 
must 
be 
to 
blame 
for 
my 
feeling 
ill”—this 
kind 
of 
reasoning 
is 
common 
to 
all 
the 
sick, 
and 
is 
indeed 
held 
the 
more 
firmly 
the 
more 
the 
real 
cause 
of 
their 
feeling 
ill, 
the 
physiological 
cause, 
remains 
hidden. 
(It 
may 
perhaps 
lie 
in 
some 
disease 
of 
the 
nervus 
sympathicus, 
or 
in 
an 
excessive 
secretion 
of 
bile, 
or 
in 
a 
deficiency 
of 
potassium 
sulphate 
and 
phosphate 
in 
the 
blood, 
or 
in 
an 
obstruction 
in 
the 
abdomen 
which 
impedes 
the 
blood 
circulation, 
or 
in 
degeneration 
of 
the 
ovaries, 
and 
the 
like). 



The 
suffering 
are 
one 
and 
all 
dreadfully 
eager 
and 
inventive 
in 
discovering 
occasions 
for 
painful 
affects; 
they 
enjoy 
being 
mistrustful 
and 
dwelling 
on 
nasty 
deeds 
and 
imaginary 
slights; 
they 
scour 
the 
entrails 
of 
their 
past 
and 
present 
for 
obscure 
and 
questionable 
occurrences 
that 
offer 
them 
the 
opportunity 
to 
revel 
in 
tormenting 
suspicions 
and 
to 
intoxicate 
themselves 
with 
the 
poison 
of 
their 
own 
malice: 
they 
tear 
open 
their 
oldest 
wounds, 
they 
bleed 
from 
long-healed 
scars, 
they 
make 
evildoers 
out 
of 
their 
friends, 
wives, 
children, 
and 
whoever 
else 
stands 
closest 
to 
them.1 


“I 
suffer: 
someone 
must 
be 
to 
blame 
for 
it”—thus 
thinks 
every 
sickly 
sheep. 
But 
his 
shepherd, 
the 
ascetic 
priest, 
tells 
him: 
“Quite 
so, 
my 
sheep! 
someone 
must 
be 
to 
blame 
for 
it: 
but 
you 
yourself 
are 
this 
someone, 
you 
alone 
are 
to 
blame 
for 
it—you 
alone 
are 
to 
blame 
for 
yourself!”—This 
is 
brazen 
and 
false 
enough: 
but 
one 
thing 
at 
least 
is 
achieved 
by 
it, 
the 
direction 
of 
ressentiment 
is 
altered. 



16 


You 
will 
guess 
what, 
according 
to 
my 
idea, 
the 
curative 
instinct 
of 
life 
has 
at 
least 
attempted 
through 
the 
ascetic 
priest, 
and 
why 
it 
required 
for 
a 
time 
the 
tyranny 
of 
such 
paradoxical 
and 
paralogical 
concepts 
as 
“guilt,” 
“sin,” 
“sinfulness,” 
“depravity,” 
“damnation”: 
to 
render 
the 
sick 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
harmless, 
to 
work 
the 
self-destruction 
of 
the 
incurable, 
to 
direct 
the 
ressentiment 
of 
the 
less 
severely 
afflicted 
sternly 
back 
upon 
themselves 
(“one 
thing 
is 
needful”)—and 
in 
this 
way 
to 
exploit 
the 
bad 
instincts 
of 
all 
sufferers 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
self-discipline, 
self-surveillance, 
and 
self-overcoming. 


It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
a 
“medication” 
of 
this 
kind, 
a 
mere 
affect 
medication, 
cannot 
possibly 
bring 
about 
a 
real 
cure 
of 
sickness 
in 
a 
physiological 
sense; 
we 
may 
not 
even 
suppose 
that 
the 
instinct 
of 
life 
contemplates 
or 
intends 
any 
sort 
of 
cure. 
A 
kind 
of 
concentration 
and 
organization 
of 
the 
sick 
on 
one 
side 
(the 
word 
“church” 
is 
the 
most 
popular 
name 
for 
it), 
a 
kind 
of 
provisional 
safeguarding 
of 
the 
more 
healthily 
constituted, 
the 
more 
fully 
achieved, 
on 
the 
other, 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
chasm 
between 
healthy 
and 
sick—for 
a 
long 
time 
that 
was 
all! 
And 
it 
was 
much! 
very 
much! 


(It 
is 
plain 
that 
in 
this 
essay 
I 
proceed 
on 
a 
presupposition 
that 
I 
do 
not 
first 
have 
to 
demonstrate 
to 
readers 
of 
the 
kind 
I 
need: 
that 
man’s 
“sinfulness” 
is 
not 
a 
fact, 
but 
merely 
the 
interpretation 
of 
a 
fact, 
namely 
of 
physiological 
depression—the 
latter 
viewed 
in 
a 
religio-moral 
perspective 
that 
is 
no 
longer 
binding 
on 
us.— 
That 
someone 
feels 
“guilty” 
or 
“sinful” 
is 
no 
proof 
that 
he 
is 
right, 
any 
more 
than 
a 
man 
is 
healthy 
merely 
because 
he 
feels 
healthy. 
Recall 
the 
famous 
witch 
trials: 
the 
most 
acute 
and 
humane 
judges 
were 
in 
no 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
guilt 
of 
the 
accused; 
the 
“witches” 
themselves 
did 
not 
doubt 
it—and 
yet 
there 
was 
no 
guilt. 
— 
To 
express 
this 
presupposition 
in 
a 
more 
general 
form: 
I 
consider 
even 
“psychological 
pain” 
to 
be 
not 
a 
fact 
but 
only 
an 
interpretation—a 
causal 
interpretation—of 
facts 
that 
have 
hitherto 
defied 
exact 
formulation—too 
vague 
to 
be 
scientifically 
serious—a 
fat 
word 
replacing 
a 
very 
thin 
question 
mark. 
When 
someone 
cannot 
get 
over 
a 
“psychological 
pain,” 
that 
is 
not 
the 
fault 
of 
his 
“psyche” 
but, 
to 
speak 
crudely, 
more 
probably 
even 
that 
of 
his 
belly 
(speaking 
crudely, 
to 
repeat, 



which 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
I 
want 
to 
be 
heard 
crudely 
or 
understood 
crudely 
—). 
A 
strong 
and 
well-constituted 
man 
digests 
his 
experiences 
(his 
deeds 
and 
misdeeds 
included) 
as 
he 
digests 
his 
meals, 
even 
when 
he 
has 
to 
swallow 
some 
tough 
morsels. 
If 
he 
cannot 
get 
over 
an 
experience 
and 
have 
done 
with 
it, 
this 
kind 
of 
indigestion 
is 
as 
much 
physiological 
as 
is 
the 
other—and 
often 
in 
fact 
merely 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
other.— 
With 
such 
a 
conception 
one 
can, 
between 
ourselves, 
still 
be 
the 
sternest 
opponent 
of 
all 
materialism.—) 



17 


But 
is 
he 
really 
a 
physician, 
this 
ascetic 
priest?—We 
have 
seen 
why 
it 
is 
hardly 
permissible 
to 
call 
him 
a 
physician, 
however 
much 
he 
enjoys 
feeling 
like 
a 
“savior” 
and 
letting 
himself 
be 
reverenced 
as 
a 
“savior.” 
He 
combats 
only 
the 
suffering 
itself, 
the 
discomfiture 
of 
the 
sufferer, 
not 
its 
cause, 
not 
the 
real 
sickness: 
this 
must 
be 
our 
most 
fundamental 
objection 
to 
priestly 
medication. 


But 
if 
one 
adopts 
the 
only 
perspective 
known 
to 
the 
priest, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
set 
bounds 
to 
one’s 
admiration 
of 
how 
much 
he 
has 
seen, 
sought, 
and 
found 
under 
this 
perspective. 
The 
alleviation 
of 
suffering, 
“consolation” 
of 
every 
kind—here 
lies 
his 
genius; 
how 
inventively 
he 
has 
gone 
about 
his 
task 
of 
consolation, 
how 
boldly 
and 
unscrupulously 
he 
has 
selected 
the 
means 
for 
it! 
Christianity 
in 
particular 
may 
be 
called 
a 
great 
treasure 
house 
of 
ingenious 
means 
of 
consolation: 
it 
offers 
such 
a 
collection 
of 
refreshments, 
palliatives, 
and 
narcotics; 
it 
risks 
so 
much 
that 
is 
most 
dangerous 
and 
audacious; 
it 
has 
displayed 
such 
refinement 
and 
subtlety, 
such 
southern 
subtlety, 
in 
guessing 
what 
stimulant 
affects 
will 
overcome, 
at 
least 
for 
a 
time, 
the 
deep 
depression, 
the 
leaden 
exhaustion, 
the 
black 
melancholy 
of 
the 
physiologically 
inhibited. 
For 
we 
may 
generalize: 
the 
main 
concern 
of 
all 
great 
religions 
has 
been 
to 
fight 
a 
certain 
weariness 
and 
heaviness 
grown 
to 
epidemic 
proportions. 


One 
may 
assume 
in 
advance 
the 
probability 
that 
from 
time 
to 
time 
and 
in 
certain 
parts 
of 
the 
earth 
a 
feeling 
of 
physiological 
inhibition 
is 
almost 
bound 
to 
seize 
on 
large 
masses 
of 
people, 
though, 
owing 
to 
their 
lack 
of 
physiological 
knowledge, 
they 
do 
not 
diagnose 
it 
as 
such: 
its 
“cause” 
and 
remedy 
are 
sought 
and 
tested 
only 
in 
the 
psychological-moral 
domain 
(this 
is 
my 
most 
general 
formula 
for 
what 
is 
usually 
called 
a 
“religion”). 
Such 
a 
feeling 
of 
inhibition 
can 
have 
the 
most 
various 
origins: 
perhaps 
it 
may 
arise 
from 
the 
crossing 
of 
races 
too 
different 
from 
one 
another 
(or 
of 
classes— 
classes 
always 
also 
express 
differences 
of 
origin 
and 
race: 
European 
“Weltschmerz,”1 
the 
“pessimism” 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century, 
is 
essentially 
the 
result 
of 
an 
absurdly 
precipitate 
mixing 
of 
classes); 
or 
from 
an 
injudicious 
emigration—a 
race 
introduced 
into 
a 
climate 
for 
which 
its 
powers 
of 



adaptation 
are 
inadequate 
(the 
case 
of 
the 
Indians 
in 
India); 
or 
from 
the 
aftereffects 
of 
age 
and 
exhaustion 
in 
the 
race 
(Parisian 
pessimism 
from 
1850 
onward); 
or 
from 
an 
incorrect 
diet 
(the 
alcoholism 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages; 
the 
absurdity 
of 
the 
vegetarians 
who, 
to 
be 
sure, 
can 
invoke 
the 
authority 
of 
Squire 
Christopher 
in 
Shakespeare);2 
or 
from 
degeneration 
of 
the 
blood, 
malaria, 
syphilis, 
and 
the 
like 
(German 
depression 
after 
the 
Thirty 
Years’ 
War, 
which 
infected 
half 
of 
Germany 
with 
vile 
diseases 
and 
thus 
prepared 
the 
ground 
for 
German 
servility, 
German 
pusillanimity). 
In 
every 
such 
case 
a 
grand 
struggle 
against 
the 
feeling 
of 
displeasure 
is 
attempted; 
let 
us 
briefly 
examine 
its 
principal 
forms 
and 
methods. 
(I 
here 
ignore 
altogether, 
as 
seems 
reasonable, 
the 
philosophers’ 
struggle 
against 
this 
feeling, 
which 
is 
usually 
waged 
at 
the 
same 
time: 
it 
is 
interesting 
enough 
but 
too 
absurd, 
too 
practically 
ineffective, 
too 
much 
the 
work 
of 
web-spinners 
and 
idlers—as 
when 
pain 
is 
proved 
to 
be 
an 
error, 
in 
the 
naïve 
supposition 
that 
pain 
is 
bound 
to 
vanish 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
error 
in 
it 
is 
recognized; 
but 
behold! 
it 
refuses 
to 
vanish 
…) 


This 
dominating 
sense 
of 
displeasure 
is 
combatted, 
first,3 
by 
means 
that 
reduce 
the 
feeling 
of 
life 
in 
general 
to 
its 
lowest 
point. 
If 
possible, 
will 
and 
desire 
are 
abolished 
altogether; 
all 
that 
produces 
affects 
and 
“blood” 
is 
avoided 
(abstinence 
from 
salt: 
the 
hygienic 
regimen 
of 
the 
fakirs); 
no 
love; 
no 
hate; 
indifference; 
no 
revenge; 
no 
wealth; 
no 
work; 
one 
begs; 
if 
possible, 
no 
women, 
or 
as 
little 
as 
possible; 
in 
spiritual 
matters, 
Pascal’s 
principle 
il 
faut 
s’abêtir”4 
is 
applied. 
The 
result, 
expressed 
in 
moral-psychological 
terms, 
is 
“selflessness,” 
“sanctification”; 
in 
physiological 
terms: 
hypnotization—the 
attempt 
to 
win 
for 
man 
an 
approximation 
to 
what 
in 
certain 
animals 
is 
hibernation, 
in 
many 
tropical 
plants 
estivation, 
the 
minimum 
metabolism 
at 
which 
life 
will 
still 
subsist 
without 
really 
entering 
consciousness. 
An 
astonishing 
amount 
of 
human 
energy 
has 
been 
expended 
to 
this 
end—has 
it 
been 
in 
vain? 


There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
these 
sportsmen5 
of 
“sanctity” 
who 
proliferate 
in 
almost 
all 
ages 
and 
all 
peoples 
have 
in 
fact 
discovered 
a 
real 
release 
from 
that 
which 
they 
combated 
with 
such 
rigorous 
training: 
in 
countless 
cases 
they 
have 
really 
freed 
themselves 
from 
that 
profound 
physiological 
depression 
by 
means 
of 
their 
system 
of 
hypnotics, 
which 
thus 
counts 
among 
the 
most 
universal 
facts 
of 
ethnology. 
Nor 
is 
there 
any 
ground 
for 
considering 
this 
program 
of 
starving 
the 
body 
and 
the 
desires 
as 
necessarily 
a 
symptom 
of 
lunacy 
(as 
a 
certain 
clumsy 
kind 
of 
beef-eating 
“free 
spirits” 
and 
Squire 



Christopher 
are 
wont 
to 
do). 
But 
it 
is 
certainly 
capable 
of 
opening 
the 
way 
to 
all 
kinds 
of 
spiritual 
disturbances, 
to 
“an 
inner 
light” 
for 
instance, 
as 
with 
the 
Hesychasts 
of 
Mount 
Athos,6 
to 
auditory 
and 
visual 
hallucinations, 
to 
voluptuous 
inundations 
and 
ecstasies 
of 
sensuality 
(the 
case 
of 
St. 
Theresa). 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
the 
interpretation 
which 
those 
subject 
to 
these 
states 
have 
placed 
upon 
them 
has 
always 
been 
as 
enthusiastic 
and 
false 
as 
possible; 
but 
we 
should 
not 
overlook 
the 
note 
of 
utterly 
convinced 
gratitude 
that 
finds 
expression 
in 
the 
very 
will 
to 
offer 
that 
kind 
of 
interpretation. 
The 
supreme 
state, 
redemption 
itself, 
total 
hypnotization 
and 
repose 
at 
last 
achieved, 
is 
always 
accounted 
the 
mystery 
as 
such 
for 
whose 
expression 
even 
the 
supreme 
symbols 
are 
inadequate, 
as 
entry 
and 
return 
into 
the 
ground 
of 
things, 
as 
liberation 
from 
all 
illusion, 
as 
“knowledge,” 
as 
“truth,” 
as 
“being,” 
as 
release 
from 
all 
purpose, 
all 
desire, 
all 
action, 
as 
a 
state 
beyond 
even 
good 
and 
evil. 
“Good 
and 
evil,” 
says 
the 
Buddhist—“both 
are 
fetters: 
the 
Perfect 
One 
became 
master 
over 
both”; 
“what 
is 
done 
and 
what 
is 
not 
done,” 
says 
the 
believer 
of 
the 
Vedanta, 
“give 
him 
no 
pain; 
as 
a 
sage, 
he 
shakes 
good 
and 
evil 
from 
himself; 
no 
deed 
can 
harm 
his 
kingdom; 
he 
has 
gone 
beyond 
both 
good 
and 
evil”: 
this 
idea 
is 
common 
to 
all 
of 
India, 
Hindu 
and 
Buddhist. 
(Neither 
in 
the 
Indian 
nor 
in 
the 
Christian 
conception 
is 
this 
“redemption” 
attainable 
through 
virtue, 
through 
moral 
improvement, 
however 
highly 
they 
may 
esteem 
the 
value 
of 
virtue 
as 
a 
means 
of 
hypnotization: 
one 
should 
remember 
this— 
here 
they 
are 
true 
to 
the 
facts. 
To 
have 
remained 
true 
in 
this 
may 
perhaps 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
finest 
piece 
of 
realism 
in 
the 
three 
great 
religions, 
which 
are 
in 
other 
respects 
so 
steeped 
in 
moralization. 
“For 
the 
man 
of 
knowledge 
there 
are 
no 
duties.” 


“Redemption 
cannot 
be 
attained 
through 
an 
increase 
in 
virtue; 
for 
redemption 
consists 
in 
being 
one 
with 
Brahma, 
in 
whom 
no 
increase 
in 
perfection 
is 
possible; 
nor 
through 
a 
decrease 
in 
faults: 
for 
Brahma, 
with 
whom 
to 
be 
one 
constitutes 
redemption, 
is 
eternally 
pure.” 
These 
are 
passages 
from 
the 
commentary 
of 
Shankara, 
quoted 
by 
the 
first 
European 
expert 
in 
Indian 
philosophy, 
my 
friend 
Paul 
Deussen.7) 
Let 
us 
therefore 
honor 
“redemption” 
as 
it 
appears 
in 
the 
great 
religions. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
for 
us 
to 
take 
seriously 
the 
high 
valuation 
placed 
on 
deep 
sleep 
by 
these 
people, 
so 
weary 
of 
life 
that 
they 
are 
too 
weary 
even 
to 
dream—deep 
sleep, 
that 
is, 
as 
an 
entry 
into 
Brahma, 
as 
an 
achieved 
unio 
mystica 
with 
God. 


“When 
he 
is 
completely 
asleep”—it 
says 
in 
the 
oldest 
and 
most 
venerable 
“scripture”—“and 
perfectly 
at 
rest, 
so 
that 
he 
no 
longer 
dreams, 
then, 
dearly 



beloved, 
he 
is 
united 
with 
What 
Is, 
he 
has 
entered 
into 
himself—embraced 
by 
the 
cognitive 
self, 
he 
is 
no 
longer 
conscious 
of 
what 
is 
without 
or 
within. 
Over 
this 
bridge 
come 
neither 
day 
nor 
night, 
nor 
death, 
nor 
suffering, 
nor 
good 
works, 
nor 
evil 
works.” 


“In 
deep 
sleep,” 
say 
the 
faithful 
of 
this 
deepest 
of 
the 
three 
great 
religions, 
“the 
soul 
rises 
out 
of 
the 
body, 
enters 
into 
the 
supreme 
light 
and 
thus 
steps 
forth 
in 
its 
real 
form: 
there 
it 
is 
the 
supreme 
spirit 
itself 
that 
walks 
about, 
joking 
and 
playing 
and 
amusing 
itself, 
whether 
with 
women 
or 
with 
carriages 
or 
with 
friends; 
there 
it 
thinks 
no 
more 
of 
this 
appendage 
of 
a 
body 
to 
which 
the 
prana 
(the 
breath 
of 
life) 
is 
harnessed 
like 
a 
beast 
to 
a 
cart.” 


Nonetheless, 
we 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
here, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
“redemption,” 
that, 
although 
it 
is 
arrayed 
in 
Oriental 
exaggeration, 
what 
is 
expressed 
is 
merely 
the 
same 
appraisal 
as 
that 
of 
the 
clear, 
cool, 
Hellenically 
cool, 
but 
suffering 
Epicurus: 
the 
hypnotic 
sense 
of 
nothingness, 
the 
repose 
of 
deepest 
sleep, 
in 
short 
absence 
of 
suffering—sufferers 
and 
those 
profoundly 
depressed 
will 
count 
this 
as 
the 
supreme 
good, 
as 
the 
value 
of 
values; 
they 
are 
bound 
to 
accord 
it 
a 
positive 
value, 
to 
experience 
it 
as 
the 
positive 
as 
such. 
(According 
to 
the 
same 
logic 
of 
feeling, 
all 
pessimistic 
religions 
call 
nothingness 
God.) 



18 


Much 
more 
common 
than 
this 
hypnotic 
muting 
of 
all 
sensitivity, 
of 
the 
capacity 
to 
feel 
pain—which 
presupposes 
rare 
energy 
and 
above 
all 
courage, 
contempt 
for 
opinion, 
“intellectual 
stoicism”—is 
a 
different 
training 
against 
states 
of 
depression 
which 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
easier: 
mechanical 
activity. 
It 
is 
beyond 
doubt 
that 
this 
regimen 
alleviates 
an 
existence 
of 
suffering 
to 
a 
not 
inconsiderable 
degree: 
this 
fact 
is 
today 
called, 
somewhat 
dishonestly, 
“the 
blessings 
of 
work.” 
The 
alleviation 
consists 
in 
this, 
that 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
sufferer 
is 
directed 
entirely 
away 
from 
his 
suffering—that 
activity, 
and 
nothing 
but 
activity, 
enters 
consciousness, 
and 
there 
is 
consequently 
little 
room 
left 
in 
it 
for 
suffering: 
for 
the 
chamber 
of 
human 
consciousness 
is 
small! 


Mechanical 
activity 
and 
what 
goes 
with 
it—such 
as 
absolute 
regularity, 
punctilious 
and 
unthinking 
obedience, 
a 
mode 
of 
life 
fixed 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
fully 
occupied 
time, 
a 
certain 
permission, 
indeed 
training 
for 
“impersonality,” 
for 
self-forgetfulness, 
for 
“incuria 
sui”1 


—: 
how 
thoroughly, 
how 
subtly 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
has 
known 
how 
to 
employ 
them 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
pain! 
When 
he 
was 
dealing 
with 
sufferers 
of 
the 
lower 
classes, 
with 
work-slaves 
or 
prisoners 
(or 
with 
women 
—who 
are 
mostly 
both 
at 
once, 
work-slaves 
and 
prisoners), 
he 
required 
hardly 
more 
than 
a 
little 
ingenuity 
in 
name-changing 
and 
rebaptizing 
to 
make 
them 
see 
benefits 
and 
a 
relative 
happiness 
in 
things 
they 
formerly 
hated: 
the 
slave’s 
discontent 
with 
his 
lot 
was 
at 
any 
rate 
not 
invented 
by 
the 
priest. 


An 
even 
more 
highly 
valued 
means 
of 
combating 
depression 
is 
the 
prescribing 
of 
a 
petty 
pleasure 
that 
is 
easily 
attainable 
and 
can 
be 
made 
into 
a 
regular 
event; 
this 
medication 
is 
often 
employed 
in 
association 
with 
the 
previous 
one. 
The 
most 
common 
form 
in 
which 
pleasure 
is 
thus 
prescribed 
as 
a 
curative 
is 
that 
of 
the 
pleasure 
of 
giving 
pleasure 
(doing 
good, 
giving, 
relieving, 
helping, 
encouraging, 
consoling, 
praising, 
rewarding); 
by 
prescribing 
“love 
of 
the 
neighbor,” 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
prescribes 
fundamentally 
an 
excitement 
of 
the 
strongest, 
most 
life-affirming 
drive, 
even 
if 
in 
the 
most 
cautious 
doses—namely, 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power. 
The 
happiness 
of 
“slight 



superiority,” 
involved 
in 
all 
doing 
good, 
being 
useful, 
helping, 
and 
rewarding, 
is 
the 
most 
effective 
means 
of 
consolation 
for 
the 
physiologically 
inhibited, 
and 
widely 
employed 
by 
them 
when 
they 
are 
well 
advised: 
otherwise 
they 
hurt 
one 
another, 
obedient, 
of 
course, 
to 
the 
same 
basic 
instinct. 


When 
one 
looks 
for 
the 
beginnings 
of 
Christianity 
in 
the 
Roman 
world, 
one 
finds 
associations 
for 
mutual 
aid, 
associations 
for 
the 
poor, 
for 
the 
sick, 
for 
burial, 
evolved 
among 
the 
lowest 
strata 
of 
society, 
in 
which 
this 
major 
remedy 
for 
depression, 
petty 
pleasure 
produced 
by 
mutual 
helpfulness, 
was 
consciously 
employed: 
perhaps 
this 
was 
something 
new 
in 
those 
days, 
a 
real 
discovery? 
The 
“will 
to 
mutual 
aid,” 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
herd, 
to 
“community,” 
to 
“congregation,” 
called 
up 
in 
this 
way 
is 
bound 
to 
lead 
to 
fresh 
and 
far 
more 
fundamental 
outbursts 
of 
that 
will 
to 
power 
which 
it 
has, 
even 
if 
only 
to 
a 
small 
extent, 
aroused: 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
herd 
is 
a 
significant 
victory 
and 
advance 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
depression. 
With 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
community, 
a 
new 
interest 
grows 
for 
the 
individual, 
too, 
and 
often 
lifts 
him 
above 
the 
most 
personal 
element 
in 
his 
discontent, 
his 
aversion 
to 
himself 
(Geu-lincx’s 
“despectio 
sui”).2 


All 
the 
sick 
and 
sickly 
instinctively 
strive 
after 
a 
herd 
organization 
as 
a 
means 
of 
shaking 
off 
their 
dull 
displeasure 
and 
feeling 
of 
weakness: 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
divines 
this 
instinct 
and 
furthers 
it; 
wherever 
there 
are 
herds, 
it 
is 
the 
instinct 
of 
weakness 
that 
has 
willed 
the 
herd 
and 
the 
prudence 
of 
the 
priest 
that 
has 
organized 
it. 
For 
one 
should 
not 
overlook 
this 
fact: 
the 
strong 
are 
as 
naturally 
inclined 
to 
separate 
as 
the 
weak 
are 
to 
congregate; 
if 
the 
former 
unite 
together, 
it 
is 
only 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
an 
aggressive 
collective 
action 
and 
collective 
satisfaction 
of 
their 
will 
to 
power, 
and 
with 
much 
resistance 
from 
the 
individual 
conscience; 
the 
latter, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
enjoy 
precisely 
this 
coming 
together—their 
instinct 
is 
just 
as 
much 
satisfied 
by 
this 
as 
the 
instinct 
of 
the 
born 
“masters” 
(that 
is, 
the 
solitary, 
beast-of-prey 
species 
of 
man) 
is 
fundamentally 
irritated 
and 
disquieted 
by 
organization. 
The 
whole 
of 
history 
teaches 
that 
every 
oligarchy 
conceals 
the 
lust 
for 
tyranny; 
every 
oligarchy 
constantly 
trembles 
with 
the 
tension 
each 
member 
feels 
in 
maintaining 
control 
over 
this 
lust. 
(So 
it 
was 
in 
Greece, 
for 
insance: 
Plato 
bears 
witness 
to 
it 
in 
a 
hundred 
passages—and 
he 
knew 
his 
own 
kind 
—and 
himself 
…) 



19 


The 
means 
employed 
by 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
that 
we 
have 
discovered 
up 
to 
now—the 
general 
muting 
of 
the 
feeling 
of 
life, 
mechanical 
activity, 
the 
petty 
pleasure, 
above 
all 
“love 
of 
one’s 
neighbor,” 
herd 
organization, 
the 
awakening 
of 
the 
communal 
feeling 
of 
power 
through 
which 
the 
individual’s 
discontent 
with 
himself 
is 
drowned 
in 
his 
pleasure 
in 
the 
prosperity 
of 
the 
community—these 
are, 
by 
modern 
standards, 
hrs 
innocent 
means 
in 
the 
struggle 
with 
displeasure; 
let 
us 
now 
turn 
to 
the 
more 
interesting 
means, 
the 
“guilty” 
ones. 
They 
all 
involve 
one 
thing: 
some 
kind 
of 
an 
orgy 
of 
feeling— 
employed 
as 
the 
most 
effective 
means 
of 
deadening 
dull, 
paralyzing, 
protracted 
pain; 
hence 
priestly 
inventiveness 
in 
thinking 
through 
this 
single 
question—“how 
can 
one 
produce 
an 
orgy 
of 
feeling?”—has 
been 
virtually 
inexhaustible. 


This 
sounds 
harsh; 
obviously 
it 
would 
sound 
more 
pleasant 
and 
be 
more 
ingratiating 
if 
I 
said: 
“the 
ascetic 
priest 
has 
at 
all 
times 
made 
use 
of 
the 
enthusiasm 
that 
lies 
in 
all 
strong 
affects.” 
But 
why 
stroke 
the 
effeminate 
ears 
of 
our 
modern 
weaklings? 
Why 
should 
we 
give 
way 
even 
one 
step 
to 
their 
tartuffery 
of 
words? 
For 
us 
psychologists 
this 
would 
constitute 
a 
tartuffery 
in 
deed, 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
would 
nauseate 
us. 
For 
if 
“a 
psychologist 
today 
has 
good 
taste 
(others 
might 
say, 
integrity) 
it 
consists 
in 
resistance 
to 
the 
shamefully 
moralized 
way 
of 
speaking 
which 
has 
gradually 
made 
all 
modern 
judgments 
of 
men 
and 
things 
slimy.1 


One 
should 
not 
deceive 
oneself 
in 
this 
matter: 
the 
most 
distinctive 
feature 
of 
modern 
souls 
and 
modern 
books 
is 
not 
lying 
but 
their 
inveterate 
innocence 
in 
moralistic 
mendaciousness. 
To 
have 
to 
rediscover 
this 
“innocence” 
everywhere—this 
constitutes 
perhaps 
the 
most 
disgusting 
job 
among 
all 
the 
precarious 
tasks 
a 
psychologist 
has 
to 
tackle 
today; 
it 
is 
a 
part 
of 
our 
great 
danger—it 
is 
a 
path 
that 
may 
lead 
precisely 
us 
toward 
great 
nausea. 


I 
have 
no 
doubt 
for 
what 
sole 
purpose 
modern 
books 
(if 
they 
last, 
which 
we 
fortunately 
have 
little 
reason 
to 
fear, 
and 
if 
there 
will 
one 
day 
be 
a 
posterity 
with 
a 
more 
severe, 
harder, 
healthier 
taste)—for 
what 
purpose 
everything 
modern 
will 
serve 
this 
posterity: 
as 
an 
emetic—and 
that 
on 



account 
of 
its 
moral 
mawkishness 
and 
falseness, 
its 
innermost 
feminism 
that 
likes 
to 
call 
itself 
“idealism” 
and 
at 
any 
rate 
believes 
it 
is 
idealism. 
Our 
educated 
people 
of 
today, 
our 
“good 
people,” 
do 
not 
tell 
lies—that 
is 
true; 
but 
that 
is 
not 
to 
their 
credit! 
A 
real 
lie, 
a 
genuine, 
resolute, 
“honest” 
lie 
(on 
whose 
value 
one 
should 
consult 
Plato) 
would 
be 
something 
far 
too 
severe 
and 
potent 
for 
them: 
it 
would 
demand 
of 
them 
what 
one 
may 
not 
demand 
of 
them, 
that 
they 
should 
open 
their 
eyes 
to 
themselves, 
that 
they 
should 
know 
how 
to 
distinguish 
“true” 
and 
“false” 
in 
themselves. 
All 
they 
are 
capable 
of 
is 
a 
dishonest 
lie; 
whoever 
today 
accounts 
himself 
a 
“good 
man” 
is 
utterly 
incapable 
of 
confronting 
any 
matter 
except 
with 
dishonest 
mendaciousness— 
a 
mendaciousness 
that 
is 
abysmal 
but 
innocent, 
truehearted, 
blue-eyed, 
and 
virtuous. 
These 
“good 
men”—they 
are 
one 
and 
all 
moralized 
to 
the 
very 
depths 
and 
ruined 
and 
botched 
to 
all 
eternity 
as 
far 
as 
honesty 
is 
concerned: 
who 
among 
them 
could 
endure 
a 
single 
truth 
“about 
man”? 
Or, 
put 
more 
palpably: 
who 
among 
them 
could 
stand 
a 
true 
biography? 


A 
couple 
of 
pointers: 
Lord 
Byron 
wrote 
a 
number 
of 
very 
personal 
things 
about 
himself, 
but 
Thomas 
Moore 
was 
“too 
good” 
for 
them: 
he 
burned 
his 
friend’s 
papers.2 


Dr. 
Gwinner, 
Schopenhauer’s 
executor, 
is 
said 
to 
have 
done 
the 
same:3 
for 
Schopenhauer, 
too, 
had 
written 
a 
few 
things 
about 
himself 
and 
perhaps 
against 
himself 
(eis 
heauton4). 
The 
solid 
American, 
Thayer, 
Beethoven’s 
biographer, 
suddenly 
called 
a 
halt 
to 
his 
work: 
at 
some 
point 
or 
other 
in 
this 
venerable 
and 
naïve 
life 
he 
could 
no 
longer 
take 
it.5 


Moral: 
what 
prudent 
man 
would 
write 
a 
single 
honest 
word 
about 
himself 
today?—he 
would 
have 
to 
be 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Order 
of 
Holy 
Foolhardiness 
to 
do 
so. 
We 
are 
promised 
an 
autobiography 
of 
Richard 
Wagner: 
who 
doubts 
that 
it 
will 
be 
a 
prudent 
autobiography? 


Let 
us 
finally 
mention 
that 
ludicrous 
horror 
aroused 
in 
Germany 
by 
the 
Catholic 
priest 
Janssen 
with 
his 
incomparably 
artless 
and 
innocuous 
picture 
of 
the 
Reformation 
movement. 
What 
would 
happen 
if 
someone 
were 
to 
describe 
this 
movement 
differently, 
if 
a 
real 
psychologist 
were 
to 
describe 
a 
real 
Luther, 
not 
with 
the 
moralistic 
simplicity 
of 
a 
country 
parson, 
not 
with 
the 
sickly 
and 
discreet 
bashfulness 
of 
a 
Protestant 
historian, 
but, 
say, 
with 
the 
intrepidity 
of 
a 
Taine, 
out 
of 
strength 
of 
soul 
and 
not 
out 
of 
a 
prudent 
indulgence 
toward 
strength?6 


(The 
Germans, 
incidentally, 
have 
finally 
produced 
a 
beautiful 
example 
of 
the 
classical 
type 
of 
the 
latter—they 
may 
well 
claim 
him 
as 
one 
of 
their 
own 



and 
be 
proud 
of 
him: 
Leopold 
Ranke,7 
that 
born 
classical 
advocatus 
of 
every 
causa 
fortior,8 
that 
most 
prudent 
of 
all 
prudent 
“realists.”) 



20 


But 
my 
point 
will 
have 
been 
taken—there 
is 
reason 
enough, 
is 
there 
not, 
for 
us 
psychologists 
nowadays 
to 
be 
unable 
to 
shake 
off 
a 
certain 
mistrust 
of 
ourselves. 


Probably, 
we, 
too, 
are 
still 
“too 
good” 
for 
our 
job; 
probably, 
we, 
too, 
are 
still 
victims 
of 
and 
prey 
to 
this 
moralized 
contemporary 
taste 
and 
ill 
with 
it, 
however 
much 
we 
think 
we 
despise 
it—probably 
it 
infects 
even 
us. 
What 
was 
the 
warning 
that 
diplomat 
gave 
his 
colleagues? 
“Let 
us 
above 
all 
mistrust 
our 
first 
impulses, 
gentlemen!” 
he 
said; 
“they 
are 
almost 
always 
good.”— 
Thus 
should 
every 
psychologist, 
too, 
address 
his 
colleagues 
today. 


And 
with 
that 
we 
return 
to 
our 
problem, 
which 
in 
fact 
demands 
a 
certain 
severity 
of 
us, 
especially 
a 
certain 
mistrust 
of 
“first 
impulses.” 
The 
ascetic 
ideal 
employed 
to 
produce 
orgies 
of 
feeling—whoever 
recalls 
the 
preceding 
essay 
will 
anticipate 
from 
these 
nine 
words 
the 
essence 
of 
what 
is 
now 
to 
be 
shown. 
To 
wrench 
the 
human 
soul 
from 
its 
moorings, 
to 
immerse 
it 
in 
terrors, 
ice, 
flames, 
and 
raptures 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
it 
is 
liberated 
from 
all 
petty 
displeasure, 
gloom, 
and 
depression 
as 
by 
a 
flash 
of 
lightning: 
what 
paths 
lead 
to 
this 
goal? 
And 
which 
of 
them 
do 
so 
most 
surely? 


Fundamentally, 
every 
great 
affect 
has 
this 
power, 
provided 
it 
explodes 
suddenly: 
anger, 
fear, 
voluptuousness, 
revenge, 
hope, 
triumph, 
despair, 
cruelty; 
and 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
has 
indeed 
pressed 
into 
his 
service 
indiscriminately 
the 
whole 
pack 
of 
savage 
hounds 
in 
man 
and 
let 
loose 
now 
this 
one 
and 
now 
that, 
always 
with 
the 
same 
end 
in 
view: 
to 
awaken 
men 
from 
their 
slow 
melancholy, 
to 
hunt 
away, 
if 
only 
for 
a 
time, 
their 
dull 
pain 
and 
lingering 
misery, 
and 
always 
under 
cover 
of 
a 
religious 
interpretation 
and 
“justification.” 
Every 
such 
orgy 
of 
feeling 
has 
to 
be 
paid 
for 
afterward, 
that 
goes 
without 
saying—it 
makes 
the 
sick 
sicker; 
and 
that 
is 
why 
this 
kind 
of 
cure 
for 
pain 
is, 
by 
modern 
standards, 
“guilty.” 
Yet, 
to 
be 
fair, 
one 
must 
insist 
all 
the 
more 
that 
it 
was 
employed 
with 
a 
good 
conscience, 
that 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
prescribed 
it 
in 
the 
profoundest 
faith 
in 
its 
utility, 
indeed 
indispensability—and 
even 
that 
he 
was 
often 
almost 
shattered 
by 
the 
misery 
he 
had 
caused; 
one 
must 
also 
add 
that 
the 
violent 
physiological 
revenge 
taken 
by 
such 
excesses, 
including 
even 
mental 
disturbances, 
does 
not 
really 
confute 



the 
sense 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
medication, 
which, 
as 
has 
been 
shown 
above, 
does 
not 
aim 
at 
curing 
the 
sickness 
but 
at 
combating 
the 
depression 
by 
relieving 
and 
deadening 
its 
displeasure. 
This 
is 
one 
way 
of 
attaining 
that 
end. 


The 
chief 
trick 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
permitted 
himself 
for 
making 
the 
human 
soul 
resound 
with 
heart-rending, 
ecstatic 
music 
of 
all 
kinds 
was, 
as 
everyone 
knows, 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
guilt. 
Its 
origin 
has 
been 
briefly 
suggested 
in 
the 
preceding 
essay—as 
a 
piece 
of 
animal 
psychology, 
no 
more: 
there 
we 
encountered 
the 
sense 
of 
guilt 
in 
its 
raw 
state, 
so 
to 
speak. 
It 
was 
only 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
priest, 
that 
artist 
in 
guilt 
feelings, 
that 
it 
achieved 
form—oh, 
what 
a 
form! 
“Sin”—for 
this 
is 
the 
priestly 
name 
for 
the 
animal’s 
“bad 
conscience” 
(cruelty 
directed 
backward)—has 
been 
the 
greatest 
event 
so 
far 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
sick 
soul: 
we 
possess 
in 
it 
the 
most 
dangerous 
and 
fateful 
artifice 
of 
religious 
interpretation. 
Man, 
suffering 
from 
himself 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
but 
in 
any 
case 
physiologically 
like 
an 
animal 
shut 
up 
in 
a 
cage, 
uncertain 
why 
or 
wherefore, 
thirsting 
for 
reasons—reasons 
relieve— 
thirsting, 
too, 
for 
remedies 
and 
narcotics, 
at 
last 
takes 
counsel 
with 
one 
who 
knows 
hidden 
things, 
too—and 
behold! 
he 
receives 
a 
hint, 
he 
receives 
from 
his 
sorcerer, 
the 
ascetic 
priest, 
the 
first 
hint 
as 
to 
the 
“cause” 
of 
his 
suffering: 
he 
must 
seek 
it 
in 
himself, 
in 
some 
guilt, 
in 
a 
piece 
of 
the 
past, 
he 
must 
understand 
his 
suffering 
as 
a 
punishment. 


He 
has 
heard, 
he 
has 
understood, 
this 
unfortunate: 
from 
now 
on 
he 
is 
like 
a 
hen 
imprisoned 
by 
a 
chalk 
line. 
He 
can 
no 
longer 
get 
out 
of 
this 
chalk 
circle: 
the 
invalid 
has 
been 
transformed 
into 
“the 
sinner.” 


For 
two 
millennia 
now 
we 
have 
been 
condemned 
to 
the 
sight 
of 
this 
new 
type 
of 
invalid, 
“the 
sinner”—shall 
it 
always 
be 
so?— 
everywhere 
one 
looks 
there 
is 
the 
hypnotic 
gaze 
of 
the 
sinner, 
always 
fixed 
on 
the 
same 
object 
(on 
“guilt” 
as 
the 
sole 
cause 
of 
suffering); 
everywhere 
the 
bad 
conscience, 
that 
“abominable 
beast,” 
as 
Luther 
called 
it; 
everywhere 
the 
past 
regurgitated, 
the 
fact 
distorted, 
the 
“jaundiced 
eye” 
for 
all 
action; 
everywhere 
the 
will 
to 
misunderstand 
suffering 
made 
the 
content 
of 
life, 
the 
reinterpretation 
of 
suffering 
as 
feelings 
of 
guilt, 
fear, 
and 
punishment; 
everywhere 
the 
scourge, 
the 
hair 
shirt, 
the 
starving 
body, 
contrition; 
everywhere 
the 
sinner 
breaking 
himself 
on 
the 
cruel 
wheel 
of 
a 
restless, 
morbidly 
lascivious 
conscience; 
everywhere 
dumb 
torment, 
extreme 
fear, 
the 
agony 
of 
the 
tortured 
heart, 
convulsions 
of 
an 
unknown 
happiness, 
the 
cry 
for 
“redemption.” 
The 
old 
depression, 
heaviness, 
and 
weariness 
were 
indeed 
overcome 
through 
this 
system 
of 
procedures; 
life 
again 
became 
very 
interesting: 
awake, 



everlastingly 
awake, 
sleepless, 
glowing, 
charred, 
spent 
and 
yet 
not 
weary— 
thus 
was 
the 
man, 
“the 
sinner,” 
initiated 
into 
this 
mystery. 
This 
ancient 
mighty 
sorcerer 
in 
his 
struggle 
with 
displeasure, 
the 
ascetic 
priest—he 
had 
obviously 
won, 
his 
kingdom 
had 
come: 
one 
no 
longer 
protested 
against 
pain, 
one 
thirsted 
for 
pain; 
“more 
pain! 
more 
pain!” 
the 
desire 
of 
his 
disciples 
and 
initiates 
has 
cried 
for 
centuries. 
Every 
painful 
orgy 
of 
feeling, 
everything 
that 
shattered, 
bowled 
over, 
crushed, 
enraptured, 
transported; 
the 
secrets 
of 
the 
torture 
chamber, 
the 
inventiveness 
of 
hell 
itself—all 
were 
henceforth 
discovered, 
divined, 
and 
exploited, 
all 
stood 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
sorcerer, 
all 
served 
henceforward 
to 
promote 
the 
victory 
of 
his 
ideal, 
the 
ascetic 
ideal.— 
“My 
kingdom 
is 
not 
of 
this 
world”—he 
continued 
to 
say, 
as 
before: 
but 
did 
he 
still 
have 
the 
right 
to 
say 
it? 


Goethe 
claimed 
there 
were 
only 
thirty-six 
tragic 
situations: 
one 
could 
guess 
from 
that, 
if 
one 
did 
not 
know 
it 
anyway, 
that 
Goethe 
was 
no 
ascetic 
priest. 
He—knows 
more.— 



21 


It 
would 
be 
pointless 
to 
indulge 
in 
criticism 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
priestly 
medication, 
the 
“guilty” 
kind. 
Who 
would 
want 
to 
maintain 
that 
such 
orgies 
of 
feeling 
as 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
prescribed 
for 
his 
sick 
people 
(under 
the 
holiest 
names, 
as 
goes 
without 
saying, 
and 
convinced 
of 
the 
holiness 
of 
his 
ends) 
ever 
benefited 
any 
of 
them? 
At 
least 
we 
should 
be 
clear 
on 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
“benefit.” 
If 
one 
intends 
it 
to 
convey 
that 
such 
a 
system 
of 
treatment 
has 
improved 
men, 
I 
shall 
not 
argue: 
only 
I 
should 
have 
to 
add 
what 
“improved” 
signifies 
to 
me—the 
same 
thing 
as 
“tamed,” 
“weakened,” 
“discouraged,” 
“made 
refined,” 
“made 
effete,” 
“emasculated” 
(thus 
almost 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
harmed.) 
But 
when 
such 
a 
system 
is 
chiefly 
applied 
to 
the 
sick, 
distressed, 
and 
depressed, 
it 
invariably 
makes 
them 
sicker, 
even 
if 
it 
does 
“improve” 
them; 
one 
need 
only 
ask 
psychiatrists1 
what 
happens 
to 
patients 
who 
are 
methodically 
subjected 
to 
the 
torments 
of 
repentance, 
states 
of 
contrition, 
and 
fits 
of 
redemption. 
One 
should 
also 
consult 
history: 
wherever 
the 
ascetic 
priest 
has 
prevailed 
with 
this 
treatment, 
sickness 
has 
spread 
in 
depth 
and 
breadth 
with 
astonishing 
speed. 
What 
has 
always 
constituted 
its 
“success”? 
A 
shattered 
nervous 
system 
added 
to 
any 
existing 
illness—and 
this 
on 
the 
largest 
as 
on 
the 
smallest 
scale, 
in 
individuals 
as 
in 
masses. 


In 
the 
wake 
of 
repentance 
and 
redemption 
training 
we 
find 
tremendous 
epileptic 
epidemics, 
the 
greatest 
known 
to 
history, 
such 
as 
the 
St. 
Vitus’ 
and 
St. 
John’s 
dances 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages; 
as 
another 
aftereffect 
we 
encounter 
terrible 
paralyses 
and 
protracted 
states 
of 
depression, 
which 
sometimes 
transform 
the 
temperament 
of 
a 
people 
or 
a 
city 
(Geneva, 
Basel) 
once 
and 
for 
all 
into 
its 
opposite; 
here 
we 
may 
also 
include 
the 
witch-hunt 
hysteria, 
something 
related 
to 
somnambulism 
(there 
were 
eight 
great 
epidemic 
outbreaks 
of 
this 
between 
1564 
and 
1605 
alone); 
we 
also 
find 
in 
its 
wake 
those 
death-seeking 
mass 
deliria 
whose 
dreadful 
cry 
“evviva 
la 
morte!”2 
was 
heard 
all 
over 
Europe, 
interspersed 
now 
with 
voluptuous 
idiosyncrasies, 
now 
with 
rages 
of 
destruction; 
and 
the 
same 
alternation 
of 
affects, 
accompanied 
by 
the 
same 
intermissions 
and 
somersaults, 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
even 
today 
whenever 
the 
ascetic 
doctrine 
of 
sin 
again 
achieves 
a 
grand 
success. 
(The 



religious 
neurosis 
appears 
as 
a 
form 
of 
evil; 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
about 
that. 
What 
is 
it? 
Quaeritur.3 


) 
Broadly 
speaking, 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
and 
its 
sublimely 
moral 
cult, 
this 
most 
ingenious, 
unscrupulous, 
and 
dangerous 
systematization 
of 
all 
the 
means 
for 
producing 
orgies 
of 
feeling 
under 
the 
cover 
of 
holy 
intentions, 
has 
inscribed 
itself 
in 
a 
fearful 
and 
unforgettable 
way 
in 
the 
entire 
history 
of 
man—and 
unfortunately 
not 
only 
in 
his 
history. 


I 
know 
of 
hardly 
anything 
else 
that 
has 
had 
so 
destructive 
an 
effect 
upon 
the 
health 
and 
racial 
strength 
of 
Europeans 
as 
this 
ideal; 
one 
may 
without 
any 
exaggeration 
call 
it 
the 
true 
calamity 
in 
the 
history 
of 
European 
health. 
The 
only 
thing 
that 
can 
be 
compared 
with 
its 
influence 
is 
the 
specifically 
Teutonic 
influence: 
I 
mean 
the 
alcoholic 
poisoning 
of 
Europe, 
which 
has 
hitherto 
gone 
strictly 
in 
step 
with 
the 
political 
and 
racial 
hegemony 
of 
the 
Teutons 
(wherever 
they 
infused 
their 
blood 
they 
also 
infused 
their 
vice).— 
Third 
in 
line 
would 
be 
syphilis—magno 
sed 
proxima 
intervallo.4

The 
ascetic 
priest 
has 
ruined 
psychical 
health 
wherever 
he 
has 
come 
to 
power; 
consequently 
he 
has 
also 
ruined 
taste 
in 
artibus 
et 
litteris1 


—he 
is 
still 
ruining 
it. 
“Consequently?” 
I 
hope 
I 
shall 
be 
granted 
this 
“consequently”; 
at 
any 
rate, 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
bother 
to 
prove 
it. 
Just 
one 
pointer: 
it 
concerns 
the 
basic 
book 
of 
Christian 
literature, 
its 
model, 
its 
“book 
in 
itself.” 
Even 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
Graeco-Roman 
splendor, 
which 
was 
also 
a 
splendor 
of 
books, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
an 
ancient 
literary 
world 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
eroded 
and 
been 
ruined, 
at 
a 
time 
when 
one 
could 
still 
read 
some 
books 
for 
whose 
possession 
one 
would 
nowadays 
exchange 
half 
of 
some 
national 
literatures, 
the 
simplicity 
and 
vanity 
of 
Christian 
agitators—they 
are 
called 
Church 
Fathers—had 
the 
temerity 
to 
declare: 
“we, 
too, 
have 
a 
classical 
literature, 
we 
have 
no 
need 
of 
that 
of 
the 
Greeks”; 
and 
saying 
this 
they 
pointed 
proudly 
to 
books 
of 
legends, 
letters 
of 
apostles, 
and 
apologetic 
tracts, 
rather 
as 
the 
English 
“Salvation 
Army” 
today 
employs 
similar 
literature 
in 
its 
struggle 
against 
Shakespeare 
and 
other 
“pagans.” 


I 
do 
not 
like 
the 
“New 
Testament,” 
that 
should 
be 
plain; 
I 
find 
it 
almost 
disturbing 
that 
my 
taste 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
most 
highly 
esteemed 
and 
overestimated 
work 
should 
be 
so 
singular 
(I 
have 
the 
taste 
of 
two 
millennia 
against 
me): 
but 
there 
it 
is! 
“Here 
I 
stand, 
I 
cannot 
do 
otherwise”2 


— 
I 
have 
the 
courage 
of 
my 
bad 
taste. 
The 
Old 
Testament—that 
is 
something 
else 
again: 
all 
honor 
to 
the 
Old 
Testament! 
I 
find 
in 
it 
great 
human 
beings, 
a 
heroic 
landscape, 
and 
something 
of 
the 
very 
rarest 
quality 
in 
the 
world, 
the 
incomparable 
naïveté 
of 
the 
strong 
heart; 
what 
is 
more, 
I 
find 
a 
people. 
In 
the 
New 
one, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
find 
nothing 
but 
petty 
sectarianism, 
mere 
rococo 
of 
the 
soul, 
mere 
involutions, 
nooks, 
queer 
things, 
the 
air 
of 
the 
conventicle, 
not 
to 
forget 
an 
occasional 
whiff 
of 
bucolic 
mawkishness 
that 
belongs 
to 
the 
epoch 
(and 
to 
the 
Roman 
province) 
and 
is 
not 
so 
much 
Jewish 
as 
Hellenistic. 
Humility 
and 
self-importance 
cheek-byjowl; 
a 
garrulousness 
of 
feeling 
that 
almost 
stupefies; 
impassioned 
vehemence, 
not 
passion; 
embarrassing 
gesticulation; 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
there 
is 
no 
trace 
of 
good 
breeding. 
How 
can 
one 
make 
such 
a 
fuss 
about 
one’s 
little 

lapses 
as 
these 
pious 
little 
men 
do! 
Who 
gives 
a 
damn? 
Certainly 
not 
God. 
Finally, 
they 
even 
want 
“the 
crown 
of 
eternal 
life,” 
these 
little 
provincial 
people; 
but 
for 
what? 
to 
what 
purpose? 
Presumption 
can 
go 
no 
further. 
An 
“immortal” 
Peter: 
who 
could 
stand 
him? 
Their 
ambition 
is 
laughable: 
people 
of 
that 
sort 
regurgitating 
their 
most 
private 
affairs, 
their 
stupidities, 
sorrows, 
and 
petty 
worries, 
as 
if 
the 
Heart 
of 
Being 
were 
obliged 
to 
concern 
itself 
with 
them; 
they 
never 
grow 
tired 
of 
involving 
God 
himself 
in 
even 
the 
pettiest 
troubles 
they 
have 
got 
themselves 
into. 
And 
the 
appalling 
taste 
of 
this 
perpetual 
familiarity 
with 
God! 
This 
Jewish 
and 
not 
merely 
Jewish 
obtrusiveness 
of 
pawing 
and 
nuzzling 
God! 


There 
are 
despised 
little 
“pagan 
nations” 
in 
eastern 
Asia 
from 
whom 
these 
first 
Christians 
could 
have 
learned 
something 
important, 
some 
tact 
in 
reverence; 
as 
Christian 
missionaries 
witness, 
these 
nations 
do 
not 
even 
utter 
the 
name 
of 
their 
god. 
This 
seems 
to 
me 
delicate 
enough; 
it 
is 
certainly 
too 
delicate 
not 
only 
for 
“first” 
Christians: 
to 
see 
the 
full 
contrast, 
one 
should 
recall 
Luther, 
for 
instance, 
that 
“most 
eloquent” 
and 
presumptuous 
peasant 
Germany 
has 
ever 
produced, 
and 
the 
tone 
he 
preferred 
when 
conversing 
with 
God. 
Luther’s 
attack 
on 
the 
mediating 
saints 
of 
the 
church 
(and 
especially 
on 
“the 
devil’s 
sow, 
the 
pope”) 
was, 
beyond 
any 
doubt, 
fundamentally 
the 
attack 
of 
a 
lout 
who 
could 
not 
stomach 
the 
good 
etiquette 
of 
the 
church, 
that 
reverential 
etiquette 
of 
the 
hieratic 
taste 
which 
permits 
only 
the 
more 
initiated 
and 
silent 
into 
the 
holy 
of 
holies 
and 
closes 
it 
to 
louts. 
Here 
of 
all 
places 
the 
louts 
were 
to 
be 
kept 
from 
raising 
their 
voices; 
but 
Luther, 
the 
peasant, 
wanted 
it 
altogether 
different: 
this 
arrangement 
was 
not 
German 
enough 
for 
him: 
he 
wanted 
above 
all 
to 
speak 
directly, 
to 
speak 
himself, 
to 
speak 
“informally” 
with 
his 
God.— 
Well, 
he 
did 
it. 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
never 
and 
nowhere 
been 
a 
school 
of 
good 
taste, 
even 
less 
of 
good 
manners—at 
best 
it 
was 
a 
school 
of 
hieratic 
manners: 
that 
is 
because 
its 
very 
nature 
includes 
something 
that 
is 
the 
deadly 
enemy 
of 
all 
good 
manners—lack 
of 
moderation, 
dislike 
of 
moderation; 
it 
itself 
is 
a 
“non 
plus 
ultra.”3 



23 


The 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
not 
only 
ruined 
health 
and 
taste, 
it 
has 
also 
ruined 
a 
third, 
fourth, 
fifth, 
sixth 
thing 
as 
well—I 
beware 
of 
enumerating 
everything 
(I’d 
never 
finish). 
It 
is 
my 
purpose 
here 
to 
bring 
to 
light, 
not 
what 
this 
ideal 
has 
done, 
but 
simply 
what 
it 
means; 
what 
it 
indicates; 
what 
lies 
hidden 
behind 
it, 
beneath 
it, 
in 
it; 
of 
what 
it 
is 
the 
provisional, 
indistinct 
expression, 
overlaid 
with 
question 
marks 
and 
misunderstandings. 
And 
it 
is 
only 
in 
pursuit 
of 
this 
end 
that 
I 
could 
not 
spare 
my 
readers 
a 
glance 
at 
its 
monstrous 
and 
calamitous 
effects, 
to 
prepare 
them 
for 
the 
ultimate 
and 
most 
terrifying 
aspect 
of 
the 
question 
concerning 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
ideal. 
What 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
power 
of 
this 
ideal, 
the 
monstrous 
nature 
of 
its 
power? 
Why 
has 
it 
been 
allowed 
to 
flourish 
to 
this 
extent? 
Why 
has 
it 
not 
rather 
been 
resisted? 
The 
ascetic 
ideal 
expresses 
a 
will: 
where 
is 
the 
opposing 
will 
that 
might 
express 
an 
opposing 
ideal? 
The 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
a 
goal—this 
goal 
is 
so 
universal 
that 
all 
the 
other 
interests 
of 
human 
existence 
seem, 
when 
compared 
with 
it, 
petty 
and 
narrow; 
it 
interprets 
epochs, 
nations, 
and 
men 
inexorably 
with 
a 
view 
to 
this 
one 
goal; 
it 
permits 
no 
other 
interpretation, 
no 
other 
goal; 
it 
rejects, 
denies, 
affirms, 
and 
sanctions 
solely 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
its 
interpretation 
(and 
has 
there 
ever 
been 
a 
system 
of 
interpretation 
more 
thoroughly 
thought 
through?); 
it 
submits 
to 
no 
power, 
it 
believes 
in 
its 
own 
predominance 
over 
every 
other 
power, 
in 
its 
absolute 
superiority 
of 
rank 
over 
every 
other 
power—it 
believes 
that 
no 
power 
exists 
on 
earth 
that 
does 
not 
first 
have 
to 
receive 
a 
meaning, 
a 
right 
to 
exist, 
a 
value, 
as 
a 
tool 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
as 
a 
way 
and 
means 
to 
its 
goal, 
to 
one 
goal.— 
Where 
is 
the 
match 
of 
this 
closed 
system 
of 
will, 
goal, 
and 
interpretation? 
Why 
has 
it 
not 
found 
its 
match?— 
Where 
is 
the 
other 
“one 
goal”? 


But 
they 
tell 
me 
it 
is 
not 
lacking, 
it 
has 
not 
merely 
waged 
a 
long 
and 
successful 
fight 
against 
this 
ideal, 
it 
has 
already 
conquered 
this 
ideal 
in 
all 
important 
respects: 
all 
of 
modern 
science1 
is 
supposed 
to 
bear 
witness 
to 
that 
—modern 
science 
which, 
as 
a 
genuine 
philosophy 
of 
reality, 
clearly 
believes 
in 
itself 
alone, 
clearly 
possesses 
the 
courage 
for 
itself 
and 
the 
will 
to 
itself, 
and 
has 
up 
to 
now 
survived 
well 
enough 
without 
God, 
the 
beyond, 
and 
the 



virtues 
of 
denial. 
Such 
noisy 
agitators’ 
chatter, 
however, 
does 
not 
impress 
me: 
these 
trumpeters 
of 
reality 
are 
bad 
musicians, 
their 
voices 
obviously 
do 
not 
come 
from 
the 
depths, 
the 
abyss 
of 
the 
scientific 
conscience 
does 
not 
speak 
through 
them—for 
today 
the 
scientific 
conscience 
is 
an 
abyss—the 
word 
“science” 
in 
the 
mouths 
of 
such 
trumpeters 
is 
simply 
an 
indecency, 
an 
abuse, 
and 
a 
piece 
of 
impudence. 
The 
truth 
is 
precisely 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
is 
asserted 
here: 
science 
today 
has 
absolutely 
no 
belief 
in 
itself, 
let 
alone 
an 
ideal 
above 
it—and 
where 
it 
still 
inspires 
passion, 
love, 
ardor, 
and 
suffering 
at 
all, 
it 
is 
not 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
but 
rather 
the 
latest 
and 
noblest 
form 
of 
it. 
Does 
that 
sound 
strange 
to 
you? 


Today 
there 
are 
plenty 
of 
modest 
and 
worthy 
laborers2 
among 
scholars, 
too, 
who 
are 
happy 
in 
their 
little 
nooks; 
and 
because 
they 
are 
happy 
there, 
they 
sometimes 
demand 
rather 
immodestly 
that 
one 
ought 
to 
be 
content 
with 
things 
today, 
generally—especially 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
science, 
where 
so 
much 
that 
is 
useful 
remains 
to 
be 
done. 
I 
am 
not 
denying 
that; 
the 
last 
thing 
I 
want 
is 
to 
destroy 
the 
pleasure 
these 
honest 
workers 
take 
in 
their 
craft: 
for 
I 
approve 
of 
their 
work. 
But 
that 
one 
works 
rigorously 
in 
the 
sciences 
and 
that 
there 
are 
contented 
workers 
certainly 
does 
not 
prove 
that 
science 
as 
a 
whole 
possesses 
a 
goal, 
a 
will, 
an 
ideal, 
or 
the 
passion 
of 
a 
great 
faith. 
The 
opposite 
is 
the 
case, 
to 
repeat: 
where 
it 
is 
not 
the 
latest 
expression 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
—and 
the 
exceptions 
are 
too 
rare, 
noble, 
and 
atypical 
to 
refute 
the 
general 
proposition—science 
today 
is 
a 
hiding 
place 
for 
every 
kind 
of 
discontent, 
disbelief, 
gnawing 
worm, 
despectio 
sui, 
bad 
conscience—it 
is 
the 
unrest 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
ideals, 
the 
suffering 
from 
the 
lack 
of 
any 
great 
love, 
the 
discontent 
in 
the 
face 
of 
involuntary 
contentment. 


Oh, 
what 
does 
science 
not 
conceal 
today! 
how 
much, 
at 
any 
rate, 
is 
it 
meant 
to 
conceal! 
The 
proficiency 
of 
our 
finest 
scholars, 
their 
heedless 
industry, 
their 
heads 
smoking 
day 
and 
night, 
their 
very 
craftsmanship—how 
often 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
all 
this 
lies 
in 
the 
desire 
to 
keep 
something 
hidden 
from 
oneself! 
Science 
as 
a 
means 
of 
self-narcosis: 
do 
you 
have 
experience 
of 
that? 


Whoever 
associates 
with 
scholars 
knows 
that 
one 
occasionally 
wounds 
them 
to 
the 
marrow 
with 
some 
harmless 
word; 
one 
incenses 
one’s 
scholarly 
friends 
just 
when 
one 
means 
to 
honor 
them, 
one 
can 
drive 
them 
beside 
themselves 
merely 
because 
one 
has 
been 
too 
coarse 
to 
realize 
with 
whom 
one 
was 
really 
dealing—with 
sufferers 
who 
refuse 
to 
admit 
to 
themselves 
what 
they 
are, 
with 
drugged 
and 
heedless 
men 
who 
fear 
only 
one 
thing: 
regaining 



consciousness.— 



24 


And 
now 
look, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
at 
those 
rarer 
cases 
of 
which 
I 
spoke, 
the 
last 
idealists 
left 
among 
philosophers 
and 
scholars: 
are 
they 
perhaps 
the 
desired 
opponents 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
the 
counteridealists? 
Indeed, 
they 
believe 
they 
are, 
these 
“unbelievers” 
(for 
that 
is 
what 
they 
are, 
one 
and 
all); 
they 
are 
so 
serious 
on 
this 
point, 
so 
passionate 
about 
it 
in 
word 
and 
gesture, 
that 
the 
faith1 
that 
they 
are 
opponents 
of 
this 
ideal 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
last 
remnant 
of 
faith 
they 
have 
left—but 
does 
this 
mean 
that 
their 
faith 
is 
true? 


We 
“men 
of 
knowledge” 
have 
gradually 
come 
to 
mistrust 
believers 
of 
all 
kinds; 
our 
mistrust 
has 
gradually 
brought 
us 
to 
make 
inferences 
the 
reverse 
of 
those 
of 
former 
days: 
wherever 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
faith 
is 
very 
prominently 
displayed, 
we 
infer 
a 
certain 
weakness 
of 
demonstrability, 
even 
the 
improbability 
of 
what 
is 
believed. 
We, 
too, 
do 
not 
deny 
that 
faith 
“makes 
blessed”: 
that 
is 
precisely 
why 
we 
deny 
that 
faith 
proves 
anything—a 
strong 
faith 
that 
makes 
blessed 
raises 
suspicion 
against 
that 
which 
is 
believed; 
it 
does 
not 
establish 
“truth,” 
it 
establishes 
a 
certain 
probability—of 
deception. 
What 
is 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
present 
case? 


The 
ideas 
expressed 
here 
are 
developed 
further 
in 
The 
Antichrist, 
sections 
50ff. 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
631ff.) 


See 
also 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
12, 
section 
III 
(about 
ten 
pages 
on 
“Faith 
versus 
Reason”). 
Most 
of 
the 
relevant 
passages, 
from 
the 
Dawn 
on, 
are 
cited 
there. 


These 
Nay-sayers 
and 
outsiders 
of 
today 
who 
are 
unconditional 
on 
one 
point2 


—their 
insistence 
on 
intellectual 
cleanliness; 
these 
hard, 
severe, 
abstinent, 
heroic 
spirits 
who 
constitute 
the 
honor 
of 
our 
age; 
all 
these 
pale 
atheists, 
antiChristians,
3 
immoralists, 
nihilists; 
these 
skeptics, 
ephectics,4 


hectics 
of 
the 
spirit 
(they 
are 
all 
hectics 
in 
some 
sense 
or 
other); 
these 
last 
idealists 
of 
knowledge 
in 
whom 
alone 
the 
intellectual 
conscience 
dwells 
and 
is 
incarnate 
today5 


—they 
certainly 
believe 
they 
are 
as 
completely 
liberated 
from 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
as 
possible, 
these 
“free, 
very 
free 
spirits”; 
and 
yet, 
to 
disclose 
to 
them 



what 
they 
themselves 
cannot 
see—for 
they 
are 
too 
close 
to 
themselves: 
this 
ideal 
is 
precisely 
their 
ideal, 
too; 
they 
themselves 
embody 
it 
today 
and 
perhaps 
they 
alone; 
they 
themselves 
are 
its 
most 
spiritualized 
product, 
its 
most 
advanced 
front-line 
troops 
and 
scouts, 
its 
most 
captious, 
tender, 
intangible 
form 
of 
seduction—if 
I 
have 
guessed 
any 
riddles, 
I 
wish 
that 
this 
proposition 
might 
show 
it!— 
They 
are 
far 
from 
being 
free 
spirits: 
for 
they 
still 
have 
faith 
in 
truth. 


When 
the 
Christian 
crusaders 
in 
the 
Orient 
encountered 
the 
invincible 
order 
of 
Assassins,6 
that 
order 
of 
free 
spirits 
par 
excellence, 
whose 
lowest 
ranks 
followed 
a 
rule 
of 
obedience 
the 
like 
of 
which 
no 
order 
of 
monks 
ever 
attained, 
they 
obtained 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other 
a 
hint 
concerning 
that 
symbol 
and 
watchword 
reserved 
for 
the 
highest 
ranks 
alone 
as 
their 
secretum: 
“Nothing 
is 
true, 
everything 
is 
permitted.”— 
Very 
well, 
that 
was 
freedom 
of 
spirit; 
in 
that 
way 
the 
faith 
in 
truth 
itself 
was 
abrogated.7 


Has 
any 
European, 
any 
Christian 
free 
spirit 
ever 
strayed 
into 
this 
proposition 
and 
into 
its 
labyrinthine 
consequences? 
has 
one 
of 
them 
ever 
known 
the 
Minotaur 
of 
this 
cave 
from 
experience?— 
I 
doubt 
it;8 
more, 
I 
know 
better: 
nothing 
is 
more 
foreign 
to 
these 
men 
who 
are 
unconditional 
about 
one 
thing, 
these 
so-called 
“free 
spirits,” 
than 
freedom 
and 
liberation 
in 
this 
sense; 
in 
no 
respect 
are 
they 
more 
rigidly 
bound;9 
it 
is 
precisely 
in 
their 
faith 
in 
truth 
that 
they 
are 
more 
rigid 
and 
unconditional 
than 
anyone. 
I 
know 
all 
this 
from 
too 
close 
up 
perhaps:10 
that 
venerable 
philosopher’s 
abstinence 
to 
which 
such 
a 
faith 
commits 
one; 
that 
intellectual 
stoicism 
which 
ultimately 
refuses 
not 
only 
to 
affirm 
but 
also 
to 
deny; 
that 
desire 
to 
halt 
before 
the 
factual, 
the 
factum 
brutum; 
that 
fatalism 
of 
“petits 
faits” 
(ce 
petit 
faitalisme,11 
as 
I 
call 
it) 
through 
which 
French 
scholarship 
nowadays 
tries 
to 
establish 
a 
sort 
of 
moral 
superiority 
over 
German 
scholarship; 
that 
general 
renunciation 
of 
all 
interpretation 
(of 
forcing, 
adjusting, 
abbreviating, 
omitting, 
padding, 
inventing, 
falsifying, 
and 
whatever 
else 
is 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
interpreting)—all 
this 
expresses, 
broadly 
speaking, 
as 
much 
ascetic 
virtue 
as 
any 
denial 
of 
sensuality 
(it 
is 
at 
bottom 
only 
a 
particular 
mode 
of 
this 
denial). 
That 
which 
constrains 
these 
men, 
however, 
this 
unconditional 
will 
to 
truth, 
is 
faith 
in 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
itself, 
even 
if 
as 
an 
unconscious 
imperative 
—don’t 
be 
deceived 
about 
that—it 
is 
the 
faith 
in 
a 
metaphysical 
value, 
the 
absolute 
value 
of 
truth, 
sanctioned 
and 
guaranteed 
by 
this 
ideal 
alone 
(it 
stands 
or 
falls 
with 
this 
ideal). 


Strictly 
speaking, 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
science 
“without 
any 



presuppositions”; 
this 
thought 
does 
not 
bear 
thinking 
through, 
it 
is 
paralogical: 
a 
philosophy, 
a 
“faith,” 
must 
always 
be 
there 
first 
of 
all, 
so 
that 
science 
can 
acquire 
from 
it 
a 
direction, 
a 
meaning, 
a 
limit, 
a 
method, 
a 
right 
to 
exist. 
(Whoever 
has 
the 
opposite 
notion, 
whoever 
tries, 
for 
example, 
to 
place 
philosophy 
“on 
a 
strictly 
scientific 
basis,” 
first 
needs 
to 
stand 
not 
only 
philosophy 
but 
truth 
itself 
on 
its 
head—the 
grossest 
violation 
of 
decency 
possible 
in 
relation 
to 
two 
such 
venerable 
females!) 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
it— 
and 
here 
I 
cite 
the 
fifth 
book 
of 
my 
Gay 
Science 
(section 
34412): 


“The 
truthful 
man, 
in 
the 
audacious 
and 
ultimate 
sense 
presupposed 
by 
the 
faith 
in 
science, 
thereby 
affirms 
another 
world 
than 
that 
of 
life, 
nature, 
and 
history; 
and 
insofar 
as 
he 
affirms 
this 
‘other 
world,’ 
does 
this 
not 
mean 
that 
he 
has 
to 
deny 
its 
antithesis, 
this 
world, 
our 
world? 
… 
It 
is 
still 
a 
metaphysical 
faith 
that 
underlies 
our 
faith 
in 
science—and 
we 
men 
of 
knowledge 
of 
today, 
we 
godless 
men 
and 
anti-metaphysicians, 
we, 
too, 
still 
derive 
our 
flame 
from 
the 
fire 
ignited 
by 
a 
faith 
millennia 
old, 
the 
Christian 
faith, 
which 
was 
also 
Plato’s, 
that 
God 
is 
truth, 
that 
truth 
is 
divine.—But 
what 
if 
this 
belief 
is 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
unbelievable, 
if 
nothing 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
divine 
any 
longer 
unless 
it 
be 
error, 
blindness, 
lies—if 
God 
himself 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
our 
longest 
lie?” 


At 
this 
point 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
pause 
and 
take 
careful 
stock. 
Science 
itself 
henceforth 
requires 
justification 
(which 
is 
not 
to 
say 
that 
there 
is 
any 
such 
justification).13 


Consider 
on 
this 
question 
both 
the 
earliest 
and 
most 
recent 
philosophers: 
they 
are 
all 
oblivious 
of 
how 
much 
the 
will 
to 
truth 
itself 
first 
requires 
justification; 
here 
there 
is 
a 
lacuna 
in 
every 
philosophy—how 
did 
this 
come 
about? 
Because 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
hitherto 
dominated 
all 
philosophy, 
because 
truth 
was 
posited 
as 
being, 
as 
God, 
as 
the 
highest 
court 
of 
appeal— 
because 
truth 
was 
not 
permitted 
to 
be 
a 
problem 
at 
all. 
Is 
this 
“permitted” 
understood?— 
From 
the 
moment 
faith 
in 
the 
God 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
is 
denied, 
a 
new 
problem 
arises: 
that 
of 
the 
value 
of 
truth. 


The 
will 
to 
truth 
requires 
a 
critique—let 
us 
thus 
define 
our 
own 
task—the 
value 
of 
truth 
must 
for 
once 
be 
experimentally 
called 
into 
question.14 


(Whoever 
feels 
that 
this 
has 
been 
stated 
too 
briefly 
should 
read 
the 
section 
of 
the 
Gay 
Science 
entitled 
“To 
What 
Extent 
We, 
Too, 
Are 
Still 
Pious” 
(section 
344), 
or 
preferably 
the 
entire 
fifth 
book 
of 
that 
work, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Preface 
to 
The 
Dawn.) 



25 


No! 
Don’t 
come 
to 
me 
with 
science 
when 
I 
ask 
for 
the 
natural 
antagonist 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
when 
I 
demand: 
“where 
is 
the 
opposing 
will 
expressing 
the 
opposing 
ideal?” 
Science 
is 
not 
nearly 
self-reliant 
enough 
to 
be 
that; 
it 
first 
requires 
in 
every 
respect 
an 
ideal 
of 
value, 
a 
value-creating 
power, 
in 
the 
service 
of 
which 
it 
could 
believe 
in 
itself—it 
never 
creates 
values. 
Its 
relation 
to 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
is 
by 
no 
means 
essentially 
antagonistic; 
it 
might 
even 
be 
said 
to 
represent 
the 
driving 
force 
in 
the 
latter’s 
inner 
development. 
It 
opposes 
and 
fights, 
on 
closer 
inspection, 
not 
the 
ideal 
itself 
but 
only 
its 
exteriors, 
its 
guise 
and 
masquerade, 
its 
temporary 
dogmatic 
hardening 
and 
stiffening, 
and 
by 
denying 
what 
is 
exoteric 
in 
this 
ideal, 
it 
liberates 
what 
life 
is 
in 
it. 
This 
pair, 
science 
and 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
both 
rest 
on 
the 
same 
foundation—I 
have 
already 
indicated 
it: 
on 
the 
same 
overestimation 
of 
truth 
(more 
exactly: 
on 
the 
same 
belief 
that 
truth 
is 
inestimable 
and 
cannot 
be 
criticized). 
Therefore 
they 
are 
necessarily 
allies, 
so 
that 
if 
they 
are 
to 
be 
fought 
they 
can 
only 
be 
fought 
and 
called 
in 
question 
together. 
A 
depreciation 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
unavoidably 
involves 
a 
depreciation’ 
of 
science: 
one 
must 
keep 
one’s 
eyes 
and 
ears 
open 
to 
this 
fact! 


(Art—to 
say 
it 
in 
advance, 
for 
I 
shall 
some 
day 
return 
to 
this 
subject 
at 
greater 
length—art, 
in 
which 
precisely 
the 
lie 
is 
sanctified 
and 
the 
will 
to 
deception 
has 
a 
good 
conscience, 
is 
much 
more 
fundamentally 
opposed 
to 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
than 
is 
science: 
this 
was 
instinctively 
sensed 
by 
Plato, 
the 
greatest 
enemy 
of 
art 
Europe 
has 
yet 
produced. 
Plato 
versus 
Homer: 
that 
is 
the 
complete, 
the 
genuine 
antagonism—there 
the 
sincerest 
advocate 
of 
the 
“beyond,” 
the 
great 
slanderer 
of 
life; 
here 
the 
instinctive 
deifier, 
the 
golden 
nature.1 


To 
place 
himself 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
is 
therefore 
the 
most 
distinctive 
corruption 
of 
an 
artist 
that 
is 
at 
all 
possible; 
unhappily, 
also 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
forms 
of 
corruption, 
for 
nothing 
is 
more 
easily 
corrupted 
than 
an 
artist.) 


Here 
we 
should 
recall 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
“artistic 
Socrates” 
that 
Nietzsche 
introduced 
near 
the 
end 
of 
section 
14 
of 
The 
Birth. 
He 
clearly 
does 
not 
cast 



his 
lot 
with 
either 
Plato 
or 
Homer. 
He 
is 
a 
philosopher 
and 
a 
poet—in 
his 
concerns 
much 
more 
a 
philosopher, 
but 
in 
his 
loving 
transfiguration 
of 
the 
language 
closer 
to 
the 
poets—and 
he 
does 
not 
denigrate 
this 
world 
in 
favor 
of 
another. 
He 
wants 
to 
celebrate 
this 
world, 
though, 
like 
Homer, 
he 
is 
anything 
but 
blind 
to 
its 
suffering. 
And 
not 
only 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
is 
relevant 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
theme 
here; 
The 
Gay 
Science 
is, 
too; 
e.g., 
section 
327, 
which 
will 
be 
found 
in 
this 
volume. 


Physiologically, 
too, 
science 
rests 
on 
the 
same 
foundation 
as 
the 
ascetic 
ideal: 
a 
certain 
impoverishment 
of 
life 
is 
a 
presupposition 
of 
both 
of 
them— 
the 
affects 
grown 
cool, 
the 
tempo 
of 
life 
slowed 
down, 
dialectics 
in 
place 
of 
instinct, 
seriousness 
imprinted 
on 
faces 
and 
gestures 
(seriousness, 
the 
most 
unmistakable 
sign 
of 
a 
labored 
metabolism, 
of 
struggling, 
laborious 
life). 
Observe 
the 
ages 
in 
the 
history 
of 
people 
when 
the 
scholar 
steps 
into 
the 
foreground: 
they 
are 
ages 
of 
exhaustion, 
often 
of 
evening 
and 
decline; 
overflowing 
energy, 
certainty 
of 
life 
and 
of 
the 
future, 
are 
things 
of 
the 
past. 
A 
predominance 
of 
mandarins 
always 
means 
something 
is 
wrong; 
so 
do 
the 
advent 
of 
democracy, 
international 
courts 
in 
place 
of 
war, 
equal 
rights 
for 
women, 
the 
religion 
of 
pity, 
and 
whatever 
other 
symptoms 
of 
declining 
life 
there 
are. 
(Science 
posed 
as 
a 
problem; 
what 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
science?—cf. 
the 
Preface2 
to 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy.) 


No! 
this 
“modern 
science”—let 
us 
face 
this 
fact!—is 
the 
best 
ally 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
at 
present, 
and 
precisely 
because 
it 
is 
the 
most 
unconscious, 
involuntary, 
hidden, 
and 
subterranean 
ally! 
They 
have 
played 
the 
same 
game 
up 
to 
now, 
the 
“poor 
in 
spirit” 
and 
the 
scientific 
opponents 
of 
this 
ideal 
(one 
should 
not 
think, 
by 
the 
way, 
that 
they 
are 
their 
opposites, 
the 
rich 
in 
spirit 
perhaps—they 
are 
not; 
I 
have 
called 
them 
the 
hectics3 
of 
the 
spirit). 
As 
for 
the 
famous 
victories 
of 
the 
latter, 
they 
undoubtedly 
are 
victories—but 
over 
what? 
The 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
decidedly 
not 
been 
conquered: 
if 
anything, 
it 
became 
stronger, 
which 
is 
to 
say, 
more 
elusive, 
more 
spiritual, 
more 
captious, 
as 
science 
remorselessly 
detached 
and 
broke 
off 
wall 
upon 
wall, 
external 
additions 
that 
had 
coarsened 
its 
appearance. 
Does 
anyone 
really 
believe 
that 
the 
defeat 
of 
theological 
astronomy 
represented 
a 
defeat 
for 
that 
ideal? 


Has 
man 
perhaps 
become 
less 
desirous 
of 
a 
transcendent 
solution 
to 
the 
riddle 
of 
his 
existence, 
now 
that 
this 
existence 
appears 
more 
arbitrary, 
beggarly, 
and 
dispensable 
in 
the 
visible 
order 
of 
things? 
Has 
the 
self-
belittlement 
of 
man, 
his 
will 
to 
self-belittlement, 
not 
progressed 
irresistibly 
since 
Copernicus? 
Alas, 
the 
faith 
in 
the 
dignity 
and 
uniqueness 
of 
man, 
in 
his 



irreplaceability 
in 
the 
great 
chain 
of 
being,4 
is 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past—he 
has 
become 
an 
animal, 
literally 
and 
without 
reservation 
or 
qualification, 
he 
who 
was, 
according 
to 
his 
old 
faith, 
almost 
God 
(“child 
of 
God,” 
“God-man”). 


Since 
Copernicus, 
man 
seems 
to 
have 
got 
himself 
on 
an 
inclined 
plane— 
now 
he 
is 
slipping 
faster 
and 
faster 
away 
from 
the 
center 
into—what? 
into 
nothingness? 
into 
a 
“penetrating 
sense 
of 
his 
nothingness”?5 


Very 
well! 
hasn’t 
this 
been 
the 
straightest 
route 
to—the 
old 
ideal? 


All 
science 
(and 
by 
no 
means 
only 
astronomy, 
on 
the 
humiliating 
and 
degrading 
effect 
of 
which 
Kant 
made 
the 
noteworthy 
confession: 
“it 
destroys 
my 
importance” 
…), 
all 
science, 
natural 
as 
well 
as 
unnatural—which 
is 
what 
I 
call 
the 
self-critique 
of 
knowledge—has 
at 
present 
the 
object 
of 
dissuading 
man 
from 
his 
former 
respect 
for 
himself, 
as 
if 
this 
had 
been 
nothing 
but 
a 
piece 
of 
bizarre 
conceit. 
One 
might 
even 
say 
that 
its 
own 
pride, 
its 
own 
austere 
form 
of 
stoical 
ataraxy, 
consists 
in 
sustaining 
this 
hard-won 
self-
contempt 
of 
man 
as 
his 
ultimate 
and 
most 
serious 
claim 
to 
self-respect 
(and 
quite 
rightly, 
indeed: 
for 
he 
that 
despises 
is 
always 
one 
who 
“has 
not 
forgotten 
how 
to 
respect” 
…) 
Is 
this 
really 
to 
work 
against 
the 
ascetic 
ideal? 
Does 
one 
still 
seriously 
believe 
(as 
theologians 
imagined 
for 
a 
while) 
that 
Kant’s 
victory 
over 
the 
dogmatic 
concepts 
of 
theology 
(“God,” 
“soul,” 
“freedom,” 
“immortality”) 
damaged 
that 
ideal?—it 
being 
no 
concern 
of 
ours 
for 
the 
present 
whether 
Kant 
ever 
had 
any 
intention 
of 
doing 
such 
a 
thing. 
What 
is 
certain 
is 
that, 
since 
Kant, 
transcendentalists 
of 
every 
kind 
have 
once 
more 
won 
the 
day—they 
have 
been 
emancipated 
from 
the 
theologians: 
what 
joy!— 
Kant 
showed 
them 
a 
secret 
path 
by 
which 
they 
may, 
on 
their 
own 
initiative 
and 
with 
all 
scientific 
respectability, 
from 
now 
on 
follow 
their 
“heart’s 
desire.” 


In 
the 
same 
vein: 
who 
could 
hold 
it 
against 
the 
agnostics 
if, 
as 
votaries 
of 
the 
unknown 
and 
mysterious 
as 
such, 
they 
now 
worship 
the 
question 
mark 
itself 
as 
God? 
(Xaver 
Doudan6 
once 
spoke 
of 
the 
ravages 
worked 
by 
“l’habitude 
d’admirer 
l’inintelligible 
au 
lieu 
de 
rester 
tout 
simplement 
dans 
l’inconnu”;7 
he 
thought 
the 
ancients 
had 
avoided 
this.) 
Presuming 
that 
everything 
man 
“knows” 
does 
not 
merely 
fail 
to 
satisfy 
his 
desires 
but 
rather 
contradicts 
them 
and 
produces 
a 
sense 
of 
horror, 
what 
a 
divine 
way 
out 
to 
have 
the 
right 
to 
seek 
the 
responsibility 
for 
this 
not 
in 
“desire” 
but 
in 
“knowledge”! 


“There 
is 
no 
knowledge: 
consequently—there 
is 
a 
God”: 
what 
a 
new 
elegantia 
syllogismi!8 
what 
a 
triumph 
for 
the 
ascetic 
ideal!— 



26 


Or 
does 
modern 
historiography 
perhaps 
display 
an 
attitude 
more 
assured 
of 
life 
and 
ideals? 
Its 
noblest 
claim 
nowadays 
is 
that 
it 
is 
a 
mirror; 
it 
rejects 
all 
teleology; 
it 
no 
longer 
wishes 
to 
“prove” 
anything; 
it 
disdains 
to 
play 
the 
judge 
and 
considers 
this 
a 
sign 
of 
good 
taste—it 
affirms 
as 
little 
as 
it 
denies; 
it 
ascertains, 
it 
“describes” 
… 
All 
this 
is 
to 
a 
high 
degree 
ascetic; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
to 
an 
even 
higher 
degree 
nihilistic, 
let 
us 
not 
deceive 
ourselves 
about 
that! 
One 
observes 
a 
sad, 
stern, 
but 
resolute 
glance—an 
eye 
that 
looks 
far, 
the 
way 
a 
lonely 
Arctic 
explorer 
looks 
far 
(so 
as 
not 
to 
look 
within, 
perhaps? 
so 
as 
not 
to 
look 
back? 
…) 
Here 
is 
snow; 
here 
life 
has 
grown 
silent; 
the 
last 
crows 
whose 
cries 
are 
audible 
here 
are 
called 
“wherefore?,” 
“in 
vain!,” 
“nada!”— 
here 
nothing 
will 
grow 
or 
prosper 
any 
longer, 
or 
at 
the 
most 
Petersburg 
metapolitics 
and 
Tolstoian 
“pity.” 


As 
for 
that 
other 
type 
of 
historian, 
an 
even 
more 
“modern” 
type 
perhaps, 
a 
hedonist 
and 
voluptuary 
who 
flirts 
both 
with 
life 
and 
with 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
who 
employs 
the 
word 
“artist” 
as 
a 
glove 
and 
has 
today 
taken 
sole 
lease 
of 
the 
praise 
of 
contemplation: 
oh 
how 
these 
sweetish 
and 
clever 
fellows 
make 
one 
long 
even 
for 
ascetics 
and 
winter 
landscapes! 
No! 
the 
devil 
take 
this 
type 
of 
“contemplative”! 
I 
would 
even 
prefer 
to 
wander 
through 
the 
gloomy, 
gray, 
cold 
fog 
with 
those 
historical 
nihilists! 
Indeed, 
if 
I 
had 
to 
choose 
I 
might 
even 
opt 
for 
some 
completely 
unhistorical, 
anti-historical 
person 
(such 
as 
Dühring, 
whose 
voice 
today 
intoxicates 
in 
Germany 
a 
hitherto 
shy 
and 
unavowed 
species 
of 
“beautiful 
soul,” 
the 
species 
anarchistica 
within 
the 
educated 
proletariat). 


The 
“contemplatives” 
are 
a 
hundred 
times 
worse: 
I 
know 
of 
nothing 
that 
excites 
such 
disgust 
as 
this 
kind 
of 
“objective” 
armchair 
scholar, 
this 
kind 
of 
scented 
voluptuary 
of 
history, 
half 
parson, 
half 
satyr, 
perfume 
by 
Renan,1 
who 
betrays 
immediately 
with 
the 
high 
falsetto 
of 
his 
applause 
what 
he 
lacks, 
where 
he 
lacks 
it, 
where 
in 
this 
case 
the 
Fates 
have 
applied 
their 
cruel 
shears 
with, 
alas, 
such 
surgical 
skill! 
This 
offends 
my 
taste; 
also 
my 
patience. 
let 
him 
have 
patience 
with 
such 
sights 
who 
has 
nothing 
to 
lose 
by 
them—such 
a 
sight 
arouses 
my 
ire, 
such 
“spectators” 
dispose 
me 
against 
the 
“spectacle” 



more 
than 
the 
spectacle 
itself 
(the 
spectacle 
of 
history, 
you 
understand); 
I 
fall 
unawares 
into 
an 
Anacreontic 
mood. 
Nature, 
which 
gave 
the 
bull 
his 
horns 
and 
the 
lion 
his 
chasm’ 
odontōn,2 
why 
did 
nature 
give 
me 
my 
foot? 
… 
To 
kick, 
Holy 
Anacreon! 
and 
not 
only 
for 
running 
away; 
for 
kicking 
to 
pieces 
these 
rotten 
armchairs, 
this 
cowardly 
contemplativeness, 
this 
lascivious 
historical 
eunuchism, 
this 
flirting 
with 
ascetic 
ideals, 
this 
justice-tartuffery 
of 
impotence! 


The 
Apostles 
(1866) 
and

Paul

In 
1876 
the 
fourth 
volume 
appeared, 
Renan’s 
Antichrist, 
which 
dealt 
with 
the

of 
Nero; 
and 
by 
1881 
two 
more 
volumes 
came 
out, 
The 
Christian 
Church 
and 
Marcus 
Aurelius. 
Renan 
published 
many 
other 
works 
as 
well. 


Nietzsche’s 
references 
to 
him 
are 
uniformly 
hostile:

Beyond 
Good

“Skirmishes,” 
sections

and

and

(ibid.,

All 
honor 
to 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
insofar 
as 
it 
is 
honest! 
so 
long 
as 
it 
believes 
in 
itself 
and 
does 
not 
play 
tricks 
on 
us! 
But 
I 
do 
not 
like 
all 
these 
coquettish 
bedbugs 
with 
their 
insatiable 
ambition 
to 
smell 
out 
the 
infinite, 
until 
at 
last 
the 
infinite 
smells 
of 
bedbugs; 
I 
do 
not 
like 
these 
whited 
sepulchers 
who 
impersonate 
life; 
I 
do 
not 
like 
these 
weary 
and 
played-out 
people 
who 
wrap 
themselves 
in 
wisdom 
and 
look 
“objective”; 
I 
do 
not 
like 
these 
agitators 
dressed 
up 
as 
heroes 
who 
wear 
the 
magic 
cap 
of 
ideals 
on 
their 
straw 
heads; 
I 
do 
not 
like 
these 
ambitious 
artists 
who 
like 
to 
pose 
as 
ascetics 
and 
priests 
but 
who 
are 
at 
bottom 
only 
tragic 
buffoons; 
and 
I 
also 
do 
not 
like 
these 
latest 
speculators 
in 
idealism, 
the 
anti-Semites, 
who 
today 
roll 
their 
eyes 
in 
a 
Christian-Aryan-bourgeois 
manner 
and 
exhaust 
one’s 
patience 
by 
trying 
to 
rouse 
up 
all 
the 
horned-beast 
elements 
in 
the 
people 
by 
a 
brazen 
abuse 
of 
the 
cheapest 
of 
all 
agitator’s 
tricks, 
moral 
attitudinizing 
(that 
no 
kind 
of 
swindle 
fails 
to 
succeed 
in 
Germany 
today 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
undeniable 
and 
palpable 
stagnation 
of 
the 
German 
spirit; 
and 
the 
cause 
of 
that 
I 
seek 
in 
a 
too 
exclusive 
diet 
of 
newspapers, 
politics, 
beer, 
and 
Wagnerian 
music, 
together 
with 
the 
presuppositions 
of 
such 
a 
diet: 
first, 
national 
constriction 
and 
vanity, 
the 
strong 
but 
narrow 
principle 
“Deutschland, 
Deutschland 
über 
alles,” 
and 
then 
the 
paralysis 
agitans3 
of 
“modern 
ideas”). 


Europe 
is 
rich 
and 
inventive 
today 
above 
all 
in 
means 
of 
excitation; 
it 
seems 
to 
need 
nothing 
as 
much 
as 
it 
needs 
stimulants 
and 
brandy: 
hence 
also 
the 
tremendous 
amount 
of 
forgery 
in 
ideals, 
this 
most 
potent 
brandy 
of 
the 



spirit; 
hence 
also 
the 
repulsive, 
ill-smelling, 
mendacious, 
pseudo-alcoholic 
air 
everywhere. 
I 
should 
like 
to 
know 
how 
many 
shiploads 
of 
sham 
idealism, 
heroic 
trappings 
and 
grand-word-rattles, 
how 
many 
tons 
of 
sugared 
sympathy-spirits 
(distillers: 
la 
religion 
de 
la 
souffrance4 


), 
how 
many 
“noble-indignation” 
stilts 
for 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
spiritually 
flatfooted, 
how 
many 
comedians 
of 
the 
Christian-moral 
ideal 
would 
have 
to 
be 
exported 
from 
Europe 
today 
before 
its 
air 
would 
begin 
to 
smell 
fresh 
again. 


With 
this 
overproduction 
there 
is 
obviously 
a 
new 
opening 
for 
trade 
here; 
there 
is 
obviously 
a 
“business” 
to 
be 
made 
out 
of 
little 
ideal-idols 
and 
the 
“idealists” 
who 
go 
with 
them: 
don’t 
let 
this 
opportunity 
slip! 
Who 
has 
the 
courage 
for 
it?—we 
have 
in 
our 
hands 
the 
means 
to 
“idealize” 
the 
whole 
earth! 


But 
why 
am 
I 
speaking 
of 
courage: 
only 
one 
thing 
is 
needed 
here, 
the 
hand, 
an 
uninhibited, 
a 
very 
uninhibited 
hand.— 



27 


Enough! 
Enough! 
Let 
us 
leave 
these 
curiosities 
and 
complexities 
of 
the 
most 
modern 
spirit, 
which 
provoke 
as 
much 
laughter 
as 
chagrin: 
our 
problem, 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
can 
dispense 
with 
them: 
what 
has 
this 
problem 
to 
do 
with 
yesterday 
or 
today! 
I 
shall 
probe 
these 
things 
more 
thoroughly 
and 
severely 
in 
another 
connection 
(under 
the 
title 
“On 
the 
History 
of 
European 
Nihilism”; 
it 
will 
be 
contained 
in 
a 
work 
in 
progress: 
The 
Will 
to 
Power: 
Attempt 
at 
a 
Revaluation 
of 
All 
Values1 


). 
All 
I 
have 
been 
concerned 
to 
indicate 
here 
is 
this: 
in 
the 
most 
spiritual 
sphere, 
too, 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
has 
at 
present 
only 
one 
kind 
of 
real 
enemy 
capable 
of 
harming 
it: 
the 
comedians 
of 
this 
ideal—for 
they 
arouse 
mistrust 
of 
it. 
Everywhere 
else 
that 
the 
spirit 
is 
strong, 
mighty, 
and 
at 
work 
without 
counterfeit 
today, 
it 
does 
without 
ideals 
of 
any 
kind—the 
popular 
expression 
for 
this 
abstinence 
is 
“atheism”—except 
for 
its 
will 
to 
truth. 
But 
this 
will, 
this 
remnant 
of 
an 
ideal, 
is, 
if 
you 
will 
believe 
me, 
this 
ideal 
itself 
in 
its 
strictest, 
most 
spiritual 
formulation, 
esoteric 
through 
and 
through, 
with 
all 
external 
additions 
abolished, 
and 
thus 
not 
so 
much 
its 
remnant 
as 
its 
kernel. 
Unconditional 
honest 
atheism 
(and 
its 
is 
the 
only 
air 
we 
breathe, 
we 
more 
spiritual 
men 
of 
this 
age!) 
is 
therefore 
not 
the 
antithesis 
of 
that 
ideal, 
as 
it 
appears 
to 
be; 
it 
is 
rather 
only 
one 
of 
the 
latest 
phases 
of 
its 
evolution, 
one 
of 
its 
terminal 
forms 
and 
inner 
consequences—it 
is 
the 
awe-inspiring 
catastrophe 
of 
two 
thousand 
years 
of 
training 
in 
truthfulness 
that 
finally 
forbids 
itself 
the 
lie 
involved 
in 
belief 
in 
God. 


(The 
same 
evolutionary 
course 
in 
India, 
completely 
independent 
of 
ours, 
should 
prove 
something: 
the 
same 
ideal 
leads 
to 
the 
same 
conclusion; 
the 
decisive 
point 
is 
reached 
five 
centuries 
before 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
European 
calendar, 
with 
Buddha; 
more 
exactly, 
with 
the 
Sankhya 
philosophy, 
subsequently 
popularized 
by 
Buddha 
and 
made 
into 
a 
religion.) 


What, 
in 
all 
strictness, 
has 
really 
conquered 
the 
Christian 
God? 
The 
answer 
may 
be 
found 
in 
my 
Gay 
Science 
(section 
357): 
“Christian 
morality 
itself, 
the 
concept 
of 
truthfulness 
taken 
more 
and 
more 
strictly, 
the 
confessional 
subtlety 
of 
the 
Christian 
conscience 
translated 
and 
sublimated 
into 
the 



scientific 
conscience, 
into 
intellectual 
cleanliness 
at 
any 
price. 
To 
view 
nature 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
goodness 
and 
providence 
of 
a 
God; 
to 
interpret 
history 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
a 
divine 
reason, 
as 
the 
perpetual 
witness 
to 
a 
moral 
world 
order 
and 
moral 
intentions; 
to 
interpret 
one’s 
own 
experiences, 
as 
pious 
men 
long 
interpreted 
them, 
as 
if 
everything 
were 
preordained, 
everything 
a 
sign, 
everything 
sent 
for 
the 
salvation 
of 
the 
soul—that 
now 
belongs 
to 
the 
past, 
that 
has 
the 
conscience 
against 
it, 
that 
seems 
to 
every 
more 
sensitive 
conscience 
indecent, 
dishonest, 
mendacious, 
feminism, 
weakness, 
cowardice: 
it 
is 
this 
rigor 
if 
anything 
that 
makes 
us 
good 
Europeans 
and 
the 
heirs 
of 
Europe’s 
longest 
and 
bravest 
self-overcoming.” 


All 
great 
things 
bring 
about 
their 
own 
destruction 
through 
an 
act 
of 
selfovercoming:
2 
thus 
the 
law 
of 
life 
will 
have 
it, 
the 
law 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
“self-overcoming” 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
life—the 
lawgiver 
himself 
eventually 
receives 
the 
call: 
“patere 
legem, 
quam 
ipse 
tulisti”3 


In 
this 
way 
Christianity 
as 
a 
dogma 
was 
destroyed 
by 
its 
own 
morality; 
in 
the 
same 
way 
Christianity 
as 
morality 
must 
now 
perish, 
too: 
we 
stand 
on 
the 
threshold 
of 
this 
event. 
After 
Christian 
truthfulness 
has 
drawn 
one 
inference 
after 
another, 
it 
must 
end 
by 
drawing 
its 
most 
striking 
inference, 
its 
inference 
against 
itself; 
this 
will 
happen, 
however, 
when 
it 
poses 
the 
question 
“what 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
all 
will 
to 
truth?” 


And 
here 
I 
again 
touch 
on 
my 
problem, 
on 
our 
problem, 
my 
unknown 
friends 
(for 
as 
yet 
I 
know 
of 
no 
friend): 
what 
meaning 
would 
our 
whole 
being 
possess 
if 
it 
were 
not 
this, 
that 
in 
us 
the 
will 
to 
truth 
becomes 
conscious 
of 
itself 
as 
a 
problem? 


As 
the 
will 
to 
truth 
thus 
gains 
self-consciousness—there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
of 
that—morality 
will 
gradually 
perish 
now: 
this 
is 
the 
great 
spectacle 
in 
a 
hundred 
acts 
reserved 
for 
the 
next 
two 
centuries 
in 
Europe—the 
most 
terrible, 
most 
questionable, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
the 
most 
hopeful 
of 
all 
spectacles.—

Apart 
from 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
man, 
the 
human 
animal, 
had 
no 
meaning 
so 
far. 
His 
existence 
on 
earth 
contained 
no 
goal; 
“why 
man 
at 
all?”—was 
a 
question 
without 
an 
answer; 
the 
will 
for 
man 
and 
earth 
was 
lacking; 
behind 
every 
great 
human 
destiny 
there 
sounded 
as 
a 
refrain 
a 
yet 
greater 
“in 
vain!” 
This 
is 
precisely 
what 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
means: 
that 
something 
was 
lacking, 
that 
man 
was 
surrounded 
by 
a 
fearful 
void—he 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
justify, 
to 
account 
for, 
to 
affirm 
himself; 
he 
suffered 
from 
the 
problem 
of 
his 
meaning. 
He 
also 
suffered 
otherwise, 
he 
was 
in 
the 
main 
a 
sickly 
animal: 
but 
his 
problem 
was 
not 
suffering 
itself, 
but 
that 
there 
was 
no 
answer 
to 
the 
crying 
question, 
“why 
do 
I 
suffer?” 


Man, 
the 
bravest 
of 
animals 
and 
the 
one 
most 
accustomed 
to 
suffering, 
does 
not 
repudiate 
suffering 
as 
such; 
he 
desires 
it, 
he 
even 
seeks 
it 
out, 
provided 
he 
is 
shown 
a 
meaning 
for 
it, 
a 
purpose 
of 
suffering. 
The 
meaninglessness 
of 
suffering, 
not 
suffering 
itself, 
was 
the 
curse 
that 
lay 
over 
mankind 
so 
far—and 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
offered 
man 
meaning! 
It 
was 
the 
only 
meaning 
offered 
so 
far; 
any 
meaning 
is 
better 
than 
none 
at 
all; 
the 
ascetic 
ideal 
was 
in 
every 
sense 
the 
“faute 
de 
mieux” 
par 
excellence 
so 
far. 
In 
it, 
suffering 
was 
interpreted; 
the 
tremendous 
void 
seemed 
to 
have 
been 
filled; 
the 
door 
was 
closed 
to 
any 
kind 
of 
suicidal 
nihilism. 
This 
interpretation— 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
of 
it—brought 
fresh 
suffering 
with 
it, 
deeper, 
more 
inward, 
more 
poisonous, 
more 
life-destructive 
suffering: 
it 
placed 
all 
suffering 
under 
the 
perspective 
of 
guilt. 


But 
all 
this 
notwithstanding—man 
was 
saved 
thereby, 
he 
possessed 
a 
meaning, 
he 
was 
henceforth 
no 
longer 
like 
a 
leaf 
in 
the 
wind, 
a 
plaything 
of 
nonsense—the 
“sense-less”—he 
could 
now 
will 
something; 
no 
matter 
at 
first 
to 
what 
end, 
why, 
with 
what 
he 
willed: 
the 
will 
itself 
was 
saved. 


We 
can 
no 
longer 
conceal 
from 
ourselves 
what 
is 
expressed 
by 
all 
that 
willing 
which 
has 
taken 
its 
direction 
from 
the 
ascetic 
ideal: 
this 
hatred 
of 
the 
human, 
and 
even 
more 
of 
the 
animal, 
and 
more 
still 
of 
the 
material, 
this 
horror 
of 
the 
senses, 
of 
reason 
itself, 
this 
fear 
of 
happiness 
and 
beauty, 
this 
longing 
to 
get 
away 
from 
all 
appearance, 
change, 
becoming, 
death, 
wishing, 
from 
longing 
itself—all 
this 
means—let 
us 
dare 
to 
grasp 
it—a 
will 
to 



nothingness, 
an 
aversion1 
to 
life, 
a 
rebellion 
against 
the 
most 
fundamental 
presuppositions 
of 
life; 
but 
it 
is 
and 
remains 
a 
will! 
… 
And, 
to 
repeat 
in 
conclusion 
what 
I 
said 
at 
the 
beginning: 
man 
would 
rather 
will 
nothingness 
than 
not 
will.2—

Ludwig 
Feuerbach 
(1804–1872) 
was 
the 
outstanding 
“Young” 
(left-wing) 
Hegelian 
philosopher 
who 
tried 
to 
transform 
theology 
into 
anthropology. 
His 
influence 
on 
Karl 
Marx 
was 
considerable, 
but 
Marx 
and 
Engels 
took 
sharp 
issue 
with 
him. 
Feuerbach’s 
book, 
Das 
Wesen 
des 
Christentums 
(1841) 
was 
translated 
into 
English 
by 
George 
Eliot 
as 
The 
Essence 
of 
Christianity 
(1853, 
2nd 
ed., 
1881), 
and 
is 
still 
considered 
a 
classic 
of 
humanism.

This 
passage 
throws 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
light 
on 
Nietzsche’s 
perspectivism 
and 
on 
his 
style 
and 
philosophical 
method.

Dieser 
Verneinende 
… 
und 
Ja-schaffende: 
cf. 
Goethe, 
Faust, 
lines 
1335ff., 
where 
Mephistopheles 
calls 
himself: 
“The 
spirit 
that 
negates 
[verneint]“ 
and 
“part 
of 
that 
force 
which 
would 
/ 
Do 
evil 
evermore, 
and 
yet 
creates 
the 
good.” 
In 
the 
next 
paragraph, 
the 
portrait 
of 
“the 
great 



experimenter” 
brings 
to 
mind 
Goethe’s 
Faust.

“Fortunate

In 
the 
next 
sentence 
the 
word 
is 
rendered 
“the 
fortunate,” 
and 
Glück 
as 
“good 
fortune”; 
but 
in 
the 
next 
paragraph 
“happy” 
and 
“happiness” 
have 
been 
used, 
as 
Nietzsche 
evidently 
means 
both.

Cf. 
Goethe’s 
letter 
to 
Frau 
von 
Stein, 
June 
8, 
1787: 
“Also, 
I 
must 
say 
myself, 
I 
think 
it 
true 
that 
humanity 
will 
triumph 
eventually, 
only 
I 
fear 
that 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
world 
will 
become 
a 
large 
hospital 
and 
each 
will 
become 
the 
other’s 
humane 
nurse.” 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
Rée, 
April 
17, 
1877, 
Nietzsche 
writes, 
“each 
the 
other’s 
‘humane 
nurse.’ 
”

The 
dangers 
of 
the 
great 
nausea 
and 
the 
great 
pity 
are 
among 
the 
central 
motifs 
of 
Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra. 
The 
theme 
of 
nausea 
is 
introduced 
in 
the 
chapter 
“On 
the 
Rabble” 
in 
Part 
Two 
and 
is 
encountered 
again 
and 
again 
in 
later 
chapters. 
Another 
chapter 
in 
Part 
Two 
bears 
the 
title 
“On 
the 
Pitying,” 
and 
the 
whole 
of 
Part 
Four, 
which 
bears 
a 
motto 
from 
that 
chapter, 
is 
cast 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
story: 
having 
overcome 
his 
nausea 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Part 
Three, 
Zarathustra’s 
final 
temptation 
is 
pity.

The 
most 
striking 
illustration 
of 
this 
sentence 
is 
found 
in 
Dostoevsky’s 
Notes 
from 
Underground—and 
on 
February 
23, 
1887, 
not 
quite 
nine 
months 
before 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Genealogy, 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Overbeck 
about 
his 
accidental 
discovery 
of 
Dostoevsky 
in 
a 
bookstore, 
where 
he 
had 
chanced 
upon 
a 
French 
translation 
of 
that 
work: 
“my 
joy 
was 
extraordinary” 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
454f.). 
In 
1888 
he 
wrote 
in 
section 
45 
of 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols: 
“The 
testimony 
of 
Dostoevsky 
is 
relevant 
to 
this 
problem—Dostoevsky, 
the 
only 
psychologist, 
incidentally, 
from 
whom 
I 
had 
something 
to 
learn; 
he 
ranks 
among 
the 
most 
beautiful 
strokes 
of 
fortune 
in 
my 
life, 
even 
more 
than 
my 
discovery 
of 
Stendhal.…” 
(ibid., 
p. 
549; 
cf. 
also 
pp. 
601 
and 
603).

The 
reference 
to 
Junker 
Christoph, 
who 
is 
mentioned 
once 
more 
later 
in 
this 
section, 
is 



presumably 
intended 
to 
allude 
to 
The 
Taming 
of 
the 
Shrew. 
“She 
eat 
no 
meat 
today, 
nor 
none 
shall 
eat” 
(IV. 
2, 
line 
200) 
is, 
of 
course, 
said 
by 
Petruchio, 
and 
in 
the 
accepted 
version 
of 
the 
play 
Christopher 
Sly, 
the 
drunken 
tinker 
who 
is 
made 
to 
believe 
that 
he 
is 
a 
lord, 
appears 
only 
in 
the 
“Induction” 
(or 
Prologue) 
and 
in 
one 
subsequent 
comment. 
But 
in 
The 
Taming 
of 
A 
(sic) 
Shrew 
(1594), 
which 
slightly 
antedates 
the 
accepted 
version 
and 
is 
attributed 
to 
Shakespeare 
by 
a 
few 
scholars, 
the 
characters 
introduced 
in 
the 
Induction 
make 
comments 
from 
time 
to 
time 
throughout 
the 
play.

Here 
as 
much 
as 
anywhere 
Freud 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
great 
heir 
who 
did 
more 
than 
anyone 
else 
to 
change 
the 
style 
of 
the 
twentieth 
century. 
Freud’s 
insistence 
on 
using 
the 
term 
“sexual” 
rather 
than 
“erotic” 
is 
a 
case 
in 
point; 
so 
is 
his 
stubborn 
insistence 
on 
the 
crucial 
importance 
of 
sexual 
factors. 
This 
was 
indeed 
influenced 
by 
the 
time 
and 
place 
in 
which 
he 
lived, 
as 
his 
critics 
have 
long 
claimed—but 
not 
in 
the 
sense 
intended 
by 
them: 
rather, 
he 
fought 
against 
the 
slimy 
idealism 
of 
the 
age. 
And 
he 
was 
quick 
to 
suspect, 
not 
without 
reason, 
that 
erstwhile 
followers 
who 
developed 
more 
ingratiating 
variations 
on 
his 
theories 
were 
guilty 
of 
“tartuffery 
in 
deed” 
and 
not 
merely 
in 
words. 
He 
seems 
to 
have 
felt—and 
this 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
central 
motifs—that 



a 
cleansing 
of 
the 
atmosphere 
and 
a 
radical 
change 
in 
tone 
were 
indispensable 
presuppositions 
of 
major 
scientific 
advances 
in 
psychology.

Wissenschaft 
does 
not 
refer 
only, 
or 
primarily, 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences, 
and 
when 
Nietzsche 
refers 
to 
scholars 
later 
in 
this 
section 
he 
is 



by 
no 
means 
changing 
the 
subject. 
It 
seems 
best 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
this 
while 
using 
“science” 
to 
translate 
Wissenschaft. 
Cf. 
Part 
Six, 
“We 
Scholars” 
(Wir 
Gelehrten, 
sections 
204–13) 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
p. 
309f., 
above. 


2 
Braves 
und 
bescheidnes 
Arbeitervolk: 
the 
following 
remarks 
about 
these 
laborers 
(where 
the 
English 
text 
speaks 
of 
“workers” 
the 
original 
again 
has 
Arbeiter) 
should 
be 
compared 
with 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
211. 


1 
In 
German 
there 
is 
a 
single 
word 
for 
belief 
and 
faith, 
Glaube. 
To 
believe 
is 
glauben; 
unbelievers, 
Ungläubige. 
In 
the 
translation, 
“faith” 
is 
called 
for 
rather 
than 
belief; 
for 
Nietzsche 
emphasizes 
the 
unconditional 
and 
religious 
character 
of 
the 
faith 
he 
discusses. 


2 
This 
unconditional 
attitude, 
this 
refusal 
to 
question 
one 
point, 
is 
what 
seems 
objectionable 
to 
Nietzsche. 


3 
Antichristen 
could 
also 
mean 
Antichrists; 
and 
when 
Nietzsche, 
a 
year 
later, 
entitled 
one 
of 
his 
last 
books 
Der 
Antichrist 
he 
plainly 
meant 
The 
Antichrist: 
the 
content 
of 
that 
book 
makes 
that 
clear, 
nor 
can 
there 
be 
any 
doubt 
about 
his 
wish 
at 
that 
time 
to 
be 
as 
provocative 
as 
possible. 
In 
the 
last 
sentence 
of 
section 
5 
of 
the 
Preface, 
which 
Nietzsche 
had 
added 
to 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
in 
1886, 
the 
year 
before, 
the 
grammatical 
form 
no 
less 
than 
the 
meaning 
makes 
it 
clear 
that 
“the 
Antichrist” 
is 
meant. 
The 
enumeration 
in 
the 
text 
above 
raises 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
critique 
Nietzsche 
offers 
is 
not 
applicable 
to 
himself: 
after 
all, 
he 
had 
also 
called 
himself 
an 
immoralist 
both 
in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
32, 
and 
in 
the 
Preface 
added 
to 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
The 
Dawn 
(section 
4); 
and 
in 
Ecce 
Homo, 
the 
following 
year, 
he 
several 
times 
called 
himself 
“the 
first 
immoralist.” 
Nevertheless, 
the 
plural 
in 
the 
text 
above 
and 
the 
whole 
“feel” 
of 
the 
passage 
make 
“anti-
Christians” 
the 
more 
plausible 
reading. 
For 
all 
that, 
the 
points 
just 
mentioned 
color 
the 
tone: 
the 
men 
he 
speaks 
of 
are 
plainly 
very 
close 
to 
him. 


4 
In 
section 
9 
above, 
Nietzsche 
explained 
the 
“ephectic 
bent”: 
it 
is 
the 
propensity 
to 
suspend 
judgment. 
The 
primary 
denotation 
of 
the 
next 
word, 
“hectics,” 
is 
consumptive. 


5 
This, 
from 
Nietzsche, 
is 
high 
praise 
indeed. 
Cf., 
e.g., 
The 
Gay 
Science, 
section 
2: 
“The 
Intellectual 
Conscience.— 
… 
By 
far 
the 
most 



lack 
an 
intellectual 
conscience 
… 
I 
mean: 
by 
far 
the 
most 
do 
not 
find 
it 
contemptible 
to 
believe 
this 
or 
that 
and 
to 
live 
according 
to 
it, 
without 
first 
having 
become 
conscious 
of 
the 
last 
and 
surest 
reasons 
pro 
and 
con, 
and 
without 
even 
taking 
the 
trouble 
to 
consider 
such 
reasons 
afterward; 
the 
most 
gifted 
men 
and 
the 
most 
noble 
women 
still 
belong 
to 
these 
‘by 
far 
the 
most.’ 
Yet 
what 
is 
good-heartedness, 
refinement, 
and 
genius 
to 
me, 
when 
the 
human 
being 
who 
has 
these 
virtues 
tolerates 
slack 
feelings 
in 
his 
faith 
and 
judgments, 
and 
when 
the 
demand 
for 
certainty 
is 
not 
to 
him 
the 
inmost 
craving 
and 
the 
deepest 
need—that 
which 
distinguishes 
the 
higher 
from 
the 
lower 
men.… 
Not 
to 
question, 
not 
to 
tremble 
with 
the 
craving 
and 
the 
joy 
of 
questioning 
… 
that 
is 
what 
I 
feel 
to 
be 


contemptible 
…” 


Nietzsche 
never 
renounced 
these 
views. 
See, 
e.g., 
one 
of 
his 
very 
last 
works, 
The 
Antichrist 
(section 
50; 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
p. 
632): 
“At 
every 
step 
one 
has 
to 
wrestle 
for 
truth; 
one 
has 
had 
to 
surrender 
for 
it 
almost 
everything 
to 
which 
the 
heart, 
to 
which 
our 
love, 
our 
trust 
in 
life, 
cling 
otherwise. 
That 
requires 
greatness 
of 
soul: 
the 
service 
of 
truth 
is 
the 
hardest 
service. 
What 
does 
it 
mean, 
after 
all, 
to 
have 
integrity 
in 
matters 
of 
the 
spirit? 
That 
one 
is 
severe 
against 
one’s 
heart, 
that 
one 
despises 
‘beautiful 
sentiments,’ 
that 
one 
makes 
of 
every 
Yes 
and 
No 
a 
matter 
of 
conscience. 
Faith 
makes 
blessed: 
consequently 
it 
lies.” 


Nietzsche’s 
objection 
to 
those 
“in 
whom 
alone 
the 
intellectual 
conscience 
dwells 
and 
is 
incarnate 
today” 
is 
that 
there 
is 
“one 
point” 
they 
refuse 
to 
question; 
that 
there 
is 
one 
“beautiful 
sentiment” 
they 
still 
permit 
themselves. 
As 
Nietzsche 
puts 
it 
a 
few 
lines 
later: 
“they 
still 
have 
faith 
in 
truth.” 


6 
An 
Islamic 
sect, 
founded 
in 
the 
eleventh 
century. 
“As 
for 
the 
initiated, 
they 
knew 
the 
worthlessness 
of 
positive 
religion 
and 
morality; 
they 
believed 
in 
nothing 
…” 
(Encyclopaedia 
Britannica, 
11th 
ed.) 


7 
The 
striking 
slogan 
is 
plainly 
neither 
Nietzsche’s 
coinage 
nor 
his 
motto. 
It 
is 
a 
quotation 
on 
which 
he 
comments, 
contrasting 
it 
with 
the 
unquestioning 
faith 
in 
the 
truth 
that 
characterizes 
so 
many 
so-called 
free 
spirits. 


8 
The 
Assassins’ 
slogan 
is 
often 
mistaken 
for 
Nietzsche’s 
coinage 
and 
derived 
from 
Dostoevsky; 
e.g., 
by 
Danto: 
it 
“must 
surely 
be 
a 
paraphrase 
of 
the 
Russian 
novelist 
he 
so 
admired” 
(op. 
cit., 
p. 
193). 


In 
Dostoevsky’s 
Brothers 
Karamazov 
we 
encounter 
the 
idea 
that, 
if 



mankind 
lost 
the 
belief 
in 
God 
and 
immortality, 
“everything 
would 
be 
permitted.” 
But 
what 
matters 
to 
Nietzsche 
in 
this 
section 
is 
the 
first 
half 
of 
his 
quotation, 
“nothing 
is 
true,” 
which 
has 
no 
parallel 
in 
Dostoevsky. 
Moreover, 
the 
quotation 
from 
The 
Brothers 
is 
not 
particularly 
profound: 
it 
“works” 
in 
its 
context 
in 
the 
novel 
but 
expresses 
no 
great 
insight, 
taken 
by 
itself. 


Incidentally, 
Nietzsche 
never 
read 
The 
Brothers 
(originally 
serialized 
in 
Russia 
in 
1879–80); 
and 
this 
novel 
was 
not 
translated 
into 
French 
until 
1888, 
in 
a 
mutilated 
version. 
On 
March 
7, 
1887, 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Gast 
that 
he 
had 
read, 
first, 
L’Esprit 
souterrain 
(translated, 
1886: 
Notes 
from 
Underground)’, 
then 
La 
maison 
des 
morts 
(tr., 
1886: 
The 
House 
of 
the 
Dead); 
finally, 
Humiliés 
et 
offensés 
(tr., 
1884: 
The 
Injured 
and 
the 
Insulted—the 
first 
of 
Dostoevsky’s 
novels 
to 
be 
translated 
into 
French). 
On 
October 
14, 
1888, 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Gast: 
“The 
French 
have 
produced 
a 
stage 
version 
of 
Dostoevsky’s 
main 
novel.” 
This 
was 
Le 
Crime 
et 
le 
châtiment 
(tr., 
1884: 
Crime 
and 
Punishment). 
Cf. 
F. 
W. 
J. 
Hemmings, 
The 
Russian 
Novel 
in 
France, 
1884–1914 
(New 
York, 
Oxford 
University 
Press, 
1950), 
especially 
p. 
241. 
See 
also 
the 
note 
on 
section 
15 
above. 


Finally, 
see 
section 
602 
of 
The 
Will 
to 
Power, 
probably 
written 
in 
1884: 
“… 
‘Everything 
is 
false! 
Everything 
is 
permitted!’ 
…” 


9 
Nietzsche 
returns 
to 
his 
objection. 


10 
Is 
Nietzsche 
here 
referring 
to 
himself? 
Without 
ruling 
out 
the 
possibility 
that 
he 
also 
had 
some 
first-hand 
experience 
of 
the 
attitude 
he 
goes 
on 
to 
describe—at 
least 
as 
a 
possibility—I 
find 
the 
portrait 
very 
different 
from 
him. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
“that 
intellectual 
stoicism 
which 
ultimately 
refuses 
not 
only 
to 
affirm 
but 
also 
to 
deny”—and 
not 
only 
this 
trait—seems 
as 
close 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
best 
friend, 
Franz 
Overbeck 
(professor 
of 
church 
history 
at 
Basel, 
and 
an 
unbeliever), 
as 
it 
seems 
remote 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
spirit. 


11 
The 
pun 
is 
less 
felicitous 
in 
English: 
small 
facts 
(the 
small 
factalism, 
as 
I 
call 
it). 


12 
In 
the 
following 
quotation, 
the 
three 
dots 
mark 
Nietzsche’s 
omission 
of 
a 
few 
words 
(about 
one 
line) 
from 
the 
text 
he 
quotes. 
Most 
of 
section 
344 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
448–50. 
See 
also 
Kaufmann’s 
Nietzsche, 
Chapter 
12, 
section 
III. 


13 
Neither 
is 
it 
to 
say 
that 
no 
justification 
is 
possible. 
The 
point 
is 



that 
the 
problem 
has 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
all 
seriousness. 
Even 
as 
it 
is 
naïve 
to 
suppose 
that 
we 
know 
what 
is 
good 
and 
what 
is 
evil—and 
it 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
intent 
to 
show 
us 
how 
problematic 
morality 
is—it 
is 
also 
naïve 
to 
overlook 
that 
the 
justification 
of 
science 
poses 
a 
problem. 


14 
This 
is 
the 
conclusion 
to 
which 
Nietzsche 
has 
been 
working 
up. 


1 
We 
return 
to 
a 
problem 
posed 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
first 
book, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy: 
the 
relation 
of 
art 
and 
science. 
There 
it 
was 
the 
contrast 
of 
tragedy 
and 
Socratism 
that 
served 
as 
a 
point 
of 
departure; 
here 
“Plato 
versus 
Homer” 
sums 
up 
the 
problem. 
Nietzsche 
still 
finds 
Socratism 
and 
the 
unquestioned 
faith 
in 
a 
life 
devoted 
to 
scientific 
inquiry 
problematic. 
But 
he 
is 
as 
far 
as 
ever 
from 
contempt 
for 
the 
life 
of 
inquiry: 
after 
all, 
was 
not 
this 
the 
life 
he 
himself 
chose, 
clinging 
to 
it 
in 
spite 
of 
his 
doctors’ 
advice 
to 
read 
and 
write 
less?

Translator’s 
Introduction 


Although 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
Nietzsche 
and 
Wagner 
were 
friends 
for 
a 
while 
and 
then 
broke 
with 
each 
other, 
this 
essay 
has 
not 
received 
the 
attention 
it 
deserves. 
In 
English 
it 
has 
so 
far 
been 
available 
only 
in 
the 
old 
eighteen-
volume 
edition 
of 
the 
Collected 
Works. 
An 
earlier 
version, 
done 
for 
the 
same 
collection, 
was 
discarded. 


This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
to 
review 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
two 
men 
in 
detail, 
or 
to 
discuss 
and 
evaluate 
the 
literature 
on 
the 
subject. 
A 
rapid 
sketch 
of 
the 
background 
of 
this 
book 
must 
suffice. 


Wagner, 
born 
in 
1813—the 
same 
year 
as 
Nietzsche’s 
father, 
as 
well 
as 
Verdi 
and 
Kierkegaard—was 
the 
only 
great 
genius 
whom 
Nietzsche 
ever 
knew 
intimately. 
The 
friendship 
was 
never 
even 
remotely 
symmetrical: 
apart 
from 
the 
difference 
in 
age, 
Nietzsche 
was 
still 
a 
student 
in 
November 
1868 
when, 
at 
twenty-four, 
he 
first 
met 
Wagner 
who, 
at 
fifty-five, 
had 
completed 
the 
bulk 
of 
his 
work. 
That 
winter 
Nietzsche 
was 
appointed 
to 
a 
chair 
of 
classical 
philology 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Basel, 
in 
Switzerland, 
within 
easy 
reach 
of 
Tribschen, 
also 
in 
Switzerland, 
where 
Wagner 
was 
then 
living. 
For 
Wagner, 
who 
had 
many 
detractors, 
it 
was 
nice 
to 
have 
a 
brilliant 
young 
professor 
as 
an 
ally; 
and 
when 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
appeared, 
he 
wrote 
Nietzsche: 
“I 
have 
never 
yet 
read 
anything 
more 
beautiful 
than 
your 
book.” 
What 
he 
liked 
best 
was, 
of 
course, 
the 
worst 
part 
of 
the 
book, 
the 
lengthy 
last 
part 
with 
its 
effusive 
appreciation 
of 
Wagner. 
Nor 
did 
he 
have 
anything 
but 
praise 
for 
those 
stylistic 
qualities 
which 
Nietzsche 
himself 
later 
criticized 
in 
his 
preface 
to 
the 
edition 
of 
1886. 
Such 
imitation 
of 
his 
own 
manner 
and 
such 
acceptance 
of 
his 
image 
of 
himself 
at 
face 
value 
were 
the 
tribute 
Wagner 
exacted. 
Indeed, 
he 
asked 
for 
revisions 
in 
the 
endings 
of 
The 
Birth 
and, 
a 
little 
later, 
of 
the 
third 
“Untimely 
Meditation” 
on 
Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator; 
and 
he 
was 
displeased 
that 
in 
the 
second 
“meditation,” 
On 
the 
Use 
and 
Disadvantage 
of 
History 
for 
Life, 
there 
was 
no 
explicit 
reference 
to 
him. 
He 
had 
no 
sense 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
distinctive 
genius 
and 
mission: 
the 
younger 
man 



was 
to 
be 
his 
apostle—and 
a 
friend 
who 
could 
be 
asked 
to 
do 
the 
master’s 
Christmas 
shopping 
and 
to 
help 
with 
other 
such 
chores. 


No 
doubt 
there 
were 
many 
factors 
that 
helped 
to 
maintain 
the 
friendship 
for 
almost 
ten 
years. 
Not 
the 
least 
of 
these 
was 
a 
common 
enthusiasm 
for 
Schopenhauer, 
who 
had 
only 
recently 
begun 
to 
gain 
recognition 
as 
a 
major 
philospher. 
But 
as 
far 
as 
Nietzsche 
was 
concerned, 
the 
major 
consideration 
was 
surely 
that, 
for 
all 
his 
faults 
and 
foibles, 
Wagner 
was 
a 
great 
artist 
and 
incomparably 
more 
fascinating 
than 
anybody 
else 
Nietzsche 
knew. 
To 
be 
close 
personally 
to 
such 
a 
man, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
listen 
to 
him 
discoursing 
freely 
about 
his 
work 
and 
ideas, 
to 
belong 
to 
the 
master’s 
inner 
circle—all 
that 
was 
not 
merely 
a 
privilege 
but 
seemed 
the 
best 
thing 
that 
had 
ever 
happened 
to 
the 
young 
professor. 
Not 
only 
was 
he 
able 
to 
try 
out 
his 
own 
ideas 
on 
a 
man 
of 
genius; 
he 
had 
found 
a 
second 
home. 
Nietzsche’s 
father 
had 
died 
in 
1849, 
before 
the 
boy 
was 
five, 
and 
his 
mother’s 
narrow 
piety 
and 
lack 
of 
education 
had 
made 
his 
own 
home 
quite 
devoid 
of 
intellectual 
stimulation. 
Nietzsche 
had 
several 
good 
friends 
his 
own 
age, 
and 
some 
of 
these 
shared 
his 
enthusaism 
for 
Wagner—notably 
Erwin 
Rohde, 
the 
classical 
philologist, 
and 
Gustav 
Krug, 
who 
had 
tried 
to 
convert 
his 
friends 
to 
Wagner 
in 
the 
early 
eighteen-sixties.1 


That 
Wagner 
was 
demanding 
and 
irritable, 
and 
that 
many 
of 
his 
emphatic 
opinions 
were 
very 
dubious, 
was 
obvious 
but 
seemed 
a 
small 
price 
for 
the 
benefits 
of 
such 
a 
friendship. 
Even 
Ernest 
Newman, 
who 
yields 
to 
none 
in 
his 
admiration 
and 
enthusiasm 
for 
Wagner, 
while 
he 
lacks 
any 
solid 
first-hand 
knowledge 
of 
Nietzsche 
and, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
“masterly 
epitome 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
thinking”2 
written 
by 
one 
of 
the 
worst 
Nazi 
hacks, 
gives 
a 
thoroughly 
misleading 
picture 
of 
Nietzsche, 
speaks 
of 
Wagner’s 
“insatiable 
lust 
for 
domination,” 
admits 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
be 
“an 
undisputed 
dictator,”3 
and 
describes 
how 
Wagner 
“worked 
himself 
into 
a 
paroxysm 
over 
Bismarck’s 
tolerance 
towards 
the 
Jews.”4 
In 
short, 
to 
come 
fully 
into 
his 
own, 
Nietzsche 
had 
to 
break 
with 
Wagner. 


As 
long 
as 
he 
lived 
at 
Tribschen, 
a 
lonely 
genius, 
Wagner’s 
impassioned 
faith 
in 
the 
superiority 
of 
the 
Germans 
and 
the 
inferiority 
of 
other 
peoples, 
especially 
the 
French 
and 
the 
Jews, 
could 
perhaps 
be 
decently 
ignored; 
but 
when 
Wagner 
came 
to 
terms 
with 
the 
new 
German 
Empire 
and 
set 
up 
a 
great 
cultural 
center 
in 
Bayreuth, 
the 
time 
for 
a 
clear 
stand 
was 
at 
hand—and 
Nietzsche 
dissociated 
himself 
from 
what 
Bayreuth 
symbolized.5 
Two 
further 
factors 
contributed 
to 
the 
break. 



Nietzsche 
did 
not 
take 
Christianity 
lightly. 
His 
father, 
whose 
memory 
he 
revered, 
had 
been 
a 
minister; 
so 
had 
both 
of 
his 
grandfathers; 
and 
his 
mother 
was 
a 
devout 
Christian. 
The 
significance 
of 
Schopenhauer 
for 
Nietzsche 
and 
Wagner 
had 
been 
tied 
to 
Schopenhauer’s 
frank 
atheism. 
In 
January 
1878, 
when 
Wagner 
sent 
Nietzsche 
his 
Parsifal, 
with 
a 
humorous 
and 
friendly 
inscription, 
this 
opera 
struck 
Nietzsche 
as 
shameless: 
Wagner 
was 
exploiting 
Christianity 
for 
theatrical 
effect, 
and 
the 
self-styled 
modern 
Aeschylus 
was 
celebrating 
the 
anti-Greek 
ideal 
of 
what 
Wagner 
himself 
called 
“pure 
foolishness.” 
But 
what 
sealed 
the 
break 
was 
not 
even 
Parsifal, 
nor 
Nietzsche’s 
reaction 
to 
Wagner. 
It 
was 
rather 
Nietzsche’s 
emergence 
into 
independence 
and 
Wagner’s 
reaction 
to 
that. 


In 
May 
1878 
Nietzsche 
sent 
Wagner 
his 
own 
new 
book, 
Human, 
All-Too-
Human, 
with 
a 
motto 
from 
Descartes 
and 
a 
dedication 
to 
Voltaire. 
He 
was 
done 
with 
silence 
in 
the 
face 
of 
anti-French 
outbursts. 
He 
had 
developed 
from 
Schopenhauer 
to 
Voltaire, 
and 
from 
romantic 
essays 
to 
aphorisms 
influenced 
by 
French 
models. 
He 
repudiated 
nationalism 
emphatically 
and 
proposed 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
“good 
European.” 
All 
this 
was 
much 
more 
unforgivable 
in 
Wagner’s 
eyes 
than 
even 
Parsifal 
had 
been 
in 
Nietzsche’s, 
and 
in 
August 
of 
that 
year 
Wagner 
attacked 
his 
erstwhile 
friend 
in 
the 
Bayreuther 
Blätter. 


In 
1874, 
when 
he 
was 
still 
working 
on 
the 
fourth 
“meditation,” 
a 
eulogy 
of 
Wagner, 
Nietzsche 
had 
also 
jotted 
down 
in 
his 
notebooks 
a 
great 
many 
critical 
observations. 
The 
Birth 
had 
appeared 
in 
1872, 
the 
first 
“meditation” 
in 
1873, 
the 
second 
and 
third 
both 
in 
1874, 
but 
the 
fourth 
gave 
Nietzsche 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
trouble 
and 
was 
not 
published 
until 
1876. 
In 
Human, 
All-Too-
Human 
(1878) 
Wagner’s 
name 
does 
not 
appear—it 
is 
found 
in 
the 
preface 
added 
to 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
1886—but 
the 
chapter 
on 
the 
souls 
of 
artists 
and 
writers 
contains 
observations 
and 
reflections 
prompted 
by 
Wagner. 
With 
this 
book 
Nietzsche 
came 
into 
his 
own. 


In 
his 
later 
works 
Wagner 
is 
occasionally 
mentioned, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
until 
1888, 
when 
his 
inhibitions 
had 
decreased 
drastically, 
that 
he 
published 
a 
small 
volume 
devoted 
entirely 
to 
“The 
Case 
of 
Wagner.” 
That 
this 
book 
on 
Wagner 
troubled 
him, 
too, 
is 
evident 
even 
from 
its 
form: 
there 
is 
a 
postscript 
of 
considerable 
length, 
then 
a 
second 
postscript, 
and 
finally 
an 
epilogue. 


Wagner 
was 
dead 
by 
then, 
and 
the 
problem 
that 
confronted 
Nietzsche 
was 
in 
part 
similar 
to 
that 
which 
Heine 
had 
resolved 
when 
he 
had 
published 
one 
of 
his 
best 
books, 
Ludwig 
Börne 
(1840), 
after 
Börne’s 
death. 
The 
book 
had 
been 
greeted 
by 
a 
storm 
of 
indignation, 
but 
much 
later 
Thomas 
Mann 
was 
to 



say 
that 
of 
Heine’s 
“works 
I 
have 
long 
loved 
the 
book 
on 
Börne 
most.… 
His 
psychology 
of 
the 
Nazarene 
type 
anticipates 
Nietzsche.… 
And 
incidentally 
this 
book 
contains 
the 
most 
superb 
German 
prose 
before 
Nietzsche. 
Incidentally? 
Ah, 
only 
those 
who 
understand 
the 
blissfully 
distracted 
smile 
with 
which 
he 
answered 
his 
friends 
when 
they 
warned 
him, 
presenting 
to 
him 
the 
human, 
personal, 
political 
offensiveness 
of 
the 
book, 
‘But 
isn’t 
it 
expressed 
beautifully?’—only 
those 
comprehend 
what 
a 
memorable 
phenomenon 
this 
artist 
Jew 
has 
been 
among 
Germans!”6 


After 
the 
storm 
broke 
in 
1888, 
Nietzsche, 
who 
had 
meanwhile 
completed 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols 
and 
The 
Antichrist, 
divided 
his 
time 
between 
Ecce 
Homo 
and 
his 
final 
effort, 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner, 
which 
he 
finished 
Christmas 
1888, 
only 
a 
few 
days 
before 
his 
total 
collapse. 
This 
last 
book 
consists 
of 
passages 
“selected 
… 
from 
my 
older 
writings—some 
go 
back 
all 
the 
way 
to 
1877—perhaps 
clarified 
here 
and 
there, 
above 
all, 
shortened.”7 
The 
book 
was 
designed 
to 
show 
that 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 
had 
not 
been 
inspired 
by 
sudden 
malice, 
and 
that 
Nietzsche 
had 
long 
taken 
similar 
stands. 
Nietzsche 
sometimes 
wrote 
in 
relative 
haste, 
though 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
books 
he 
prepared 
for 
publication 
and 
the 
notes 
others 
published 
after 
his 
death 
remains 
very 
considerable. 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
is 
perhaps 
his 
most 
beautiful 
book, 
and 
those 
seeking 
a 
commentary 
to 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 
would 
surely 
have 
been 
referred 
to 
the 
later, 
still 
briefer 
book, 
had 
they 
asked 
the 
author. 


The 
present 
commentary 
consists 
of 
three 
parts: 
the 
translator’s 
introduction, 
a 
number 
of 
footnotes 
to 
the 
translation, 
and 
a 
selection 
of 
pertinent 
passages 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
correspondence 
of 
1888. 
A 
weightier 
commentary 
does 
not 
seem 
necessary—and 
would 
not 
be 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
this 
very 
short 
and 
elegant 
work.

See 
Frederick 
R. 
Love’s 
monograph 
on 
Young 
Nietzsche 
and 
the 
Wagnerian 
Experience 
(Chapel 
Hill, 
University 
of 
North 
Carolina 
Press, 
1963). 
Love’s 
most 
original 
contribution 
is 
that 
he 
shows 
how 
“the 
record 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
compositions 
clearly 
provides 
a 
basis 
for 
modifying 
the 
widely 
held 
view 
of 
the 
philosopher 
as 
a 
passionate 
devotee 
of 
Wagnerian 
music” 
(p. 
viii). 
He 
also 
argues 
that 
“Wagner’s 
music 
remained 
for 
Nietzsche 
an 
unsolved 
problem 
from 
first 
to 
last, 
a 



problem 
that 
was 
temporarily 
suppressed 
during 
the 
period 
of 
his 
closest 
association 
with 
the 
composer” 
(p. 
80), 
and 
that 
“Nietzsche’s 
infatuation 
with 
Wagnerian 
music 
… 
may 
indeed 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
aberration” 
(p. 
82). 
In 
other 
words, 
in 
1878 
Nietzsche 
did 
not 
break 
faith 
with 
himself, 
as 
the 
Wagnerians 
have 
claimed, 
but 
began 
to 
find 
himself.

Preface 


I 
have 
granted 
myself 
some 
small 
relief. 
It 
is 
not 
merely 
pure 
malice 
when 
I 
praise 
Bizet 
in 
this 
essay 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
Wagner. 
Interspersed 
with 
many 
jokes, 
I 
bring 
up 
a 
matter 
that 
is 
no 
joke. 
To 
turn 
my 
back 
on 
Wagner 
was 
for 
me 
a 
fate; 
to 
like 
anything 
at 
all 
again 
after 
that, 
a 
triumph. 
Perhaps 
nobody 
was 
more 
dangerously 
attached 
to—grown 
together 
with—Wagnerizing; 
nobody 
tried 
harder 
to 
resist 
it; 
nobody 
was 
happier 
to 
be 
rid 
of 
it. 
A 
long 
story! 
— 
You 
want 
a 
word 
for 
it?— 
If 
I 
were 
a 
moralist, 
who 
knows 
what 
I 
might 
call 
it? 
Perhaps 
self-overcoming.— 
But 
the 
philosopher 
has 
no 
love 
for 
moralists. 
Neither 
does 
he 
love 
pretty 
words. 


What 
does 
a 
philosopher 
demand 
of 
himself 
first 
and 
last? 
To 
overcome 
his 
time 
in 
himself, 
to 
become 
“timeless.” 
With 
what 
must 
he 
therefore 
engage 
in 
the 
hardest 
combat? 
With 
whatever 
marks 
him 
as 
the 
child 
of 
his 
time. 
Well, 
then! 
I 
am, 
no 
less 
than 
Wagner, 
a 
child 
of 
this 
time; 
that 
is, 
a 
decadent: 
but 
I 
comprehended 
this, 
I 
resisted 
it. 
The 
philosopher 
in 
me 
resisted. 


Nothing 
has 
preoccupied 
me 
more 
profoundly 
than 
the 
problem 
of 
decadence—I 
had 
reasons. 
“Good 
and 
evil” 
is 
merely 
a 
variation 
of 
that 
problem. 
Once 
one 
has 
developed 
a 
keen 
eye 
for 
the 
symptoms 
of 
decline, 
one 
understands 
morality, 
too—one 
understands 
what 
is 
hiding 
under 
its 
most 
sacred 
names 
and 
value 
formulas: 
impoverished 
life, 
the 
will 
to 
the 
end, 
the 
great 
weariness. 
Morality 
negates 
life. 


For 
such 
a 
task 
I 
required 
a 
special 
self-discipline: 
to 
take 
sides 
against 
everything 
sick 
in 
me, 
including 
Wagner, 
including 
Schopenhauer, 
including 
all 
of 
modern 
“humaneness.”— 
A 
profound 
estrangement, 
cold, 
sobering 
up 
—against 
everything 
that 
is 
of 
this 
time, 
everything 
timely—and 
most 
desirable 
of 
all, 
the 
eye 
of 
Zarathustra, 
an 
eye 
that 
beholds 
the 
whole 
fact 
of 
man 
at 
a 
tremendous 
distance—below. 
For 
such 
a 
goal—what 
sacrifice 
wouldn’t 
be 
fitting? 
what 
“self-overcoming”? 
what 
“self-denial”? 


My 
greatest 
experience 
was 
a 
recovery. 
Wagner 
is 
merely 
one 
of 
my 



sicknesses. 


Not 
that 
I 
wish 
to 
be 
ungrateful 
to 
this 
sickness. 
When 
in 
this 
essay 
I 
assert 
the 
proposition 
that 
Wagner 
is 
harmful, 
I 
wish 
no 
less 
to 
assert 
for 
whom 
he 
is 
nevertheless 
indispensable—for 
the 
philosopher. 
Others 
may 
be 
able 
to 
get 
along 
without 
Wagner; 
but 
the 
philosopher 
is 
not 
free 
to 
do 
without 
Wagner. 
He 
has 
to 
be 
the 
bad 
conscience 
of 
his 
time:1 
for 
that 
he 
needs 
to 
understand 
it 
best. 
But 
confronted 
with 
the 
labyrinth 
of 
the 
modern 
soul, 
where 
could 
he 
find 
a 
guide 
more 
initiated, 
a 
more 
eloquent 
prophet 
of 
the 
soul, 
than 
Wagner? 
Through 
Wagner 
modernity 
speaks 
most 
intimately, 
concealing 
neither 
its 
good 
nor 
its 
evil—having 
forgotten 
all 
sense 
of 
shame. 
And 
conversely: 
one 
has 
almost 
completed 
an 
account 
of 
the 
value 
of 
what 
is 
modern 
once 
one 
has 
gained 
clarity 
about 
what 
is 
good 
and 
evil 
in 
Wagner. 


I 
understand 
perfectly 
when 
a 
musician 
says 
today: 
“I 
hate 
Wagner, 
but 
I 
can 
no 
longer 
endure 
any 
other 
music.” 
But 
I’d 
also 
understand 
a 
philosopher 
who 
would 
declare: 
“Wagner 
sums 
up 
modernity. 
There 
is 
no 
way 
out, 
one 
must 
first 
become 
a 
Wagnerian.”

Yesterday 
I 
heard—would 
you 
believe 
it?—Bizet’s 
masterpiece, 
for 
the 
twentieth 
time. 
Again 
I 
stayed 
there 
with 
tender 
devotion; 
again 
I 
did 
not 
run 
away. 
This 
triumph 
over 
my 
impatience 
surprises 
me. 
How 
such 
a 
work 
makes 
one 
perfect! 
One 
becomes 
a 
“masterpiece” 
oneself. 


Really, 
every 
time 
I 
heard 
Carmen 
I 
seemed 
to 
myself 
more 
of 
a 
philosopher, 
a 
better 
philosopher, 
than 
I 
generally 
consider 
myself: 
so 
patient 
do 
I 
become, 
so 
happy, 
so 
Indian, 
so 
settled.— 
To 
sit 
five 
hours: 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
holiness! 


May 
I 
say 
that 
the 
tone 
of 
Bizet’s 
orchestra 
is 
almost 
the 
only 
one 
I 
can 
still 
endure? 
That 
other 
orchestral 
tone 
which 
is 
now 
the 
fashion, 
Wagner’s, 
brutal, 
artificial, 
and 
“innocent” 
at 
the 
same 
time—thus 
it 
speaks 
all 
at 
once 
to 
the 
three 
senses 
of 
the 
modern 
soul—how 
harmful 
for 
me 
is 
this 
Wagnerian 
orchestral 
tone! 
I 
call 
it 
sirocco. 
I 
break 
out 
into 
a 
disagreeable 
sweat. 
My 
good 
weather 
is 
gone. 


This 
music 
seems 
perfect 
to 
me. 
It 
approaches 
lightly, 
supplely, 
politely. 
It 
is 
pleasant, 
it 
does 
not 
sweat. 
“What 
is 
good 
is 
light; 
whatever 
is 
divine 
moves 
on 
tender 
feet”: 
first 
principle 
of 
my 
aesthetics. 
This 
music 
is 
evil, 
subtly 
fatalistic: 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
remains 
popular—its 
subtlety 
belongs 
to 
a 
race, 
not 
to 
an 
individual. 
It 
is 
rich. 
It 
is 
precise. 
It 
builds, 
organizes, 
finishes: 
thus 
it 
constitutes 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
polyp 
in 
music, 
the 
“infinite 
melody.” 
Have 
more 
painful 
tragic 
accents 
ever 
been 
heard 
on 
the 
stage? 
How 
are 
they 
achieved? 
Without 
grimaces. 
Without 
counterfeit. 
Without 
the 
lie 
of 
the 
great 
style. 


Finally, 
this 
music 
treats 
the 
listener 
as 
intelligent, 
as 
if 
himself 
a 
musician 
—and 
is 
in 
this 
respect, 
too, 
the 
counterpart 
of 
Wagner, 
who 
was, 
whatever 
else 
he 
was, 
at 
any 
rate 
the 
most 
impolite 
genius 
in 
the 
world 
(Wagner 
treats 
us 
as 
if——he 
says 
something 
so 
often—till 
one 
despairs—till 
one 
believes 
it). 


Once 
more: 
I 
become 
a 
better 
human 
being 
when 
this 
Bizet 
speaks 
to 
me. 



Also 
a 
better 
musician, 
a 
better 
listener. 
Is 
it 
even 
possible 
to 
listen 
better?— 
I 
actually 
bury 
my 
ears 
under 
this 
music 
to 
hear 
its 
causes. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
I 
experience 
its 
genesis—I 
tremble 
before 
dangers 
that 
accompany 
some 
strange 
risk; 
I 
am 
delighted 
by 
strokes 
of 
good 
fortune 
of 
which 
Bizet 
is 
innocent.— 
And, 
oddly, 
deep 
down 
I 
don’t 
think 
of 
it, 
or 
don’t 
know 
how 
much 
I 
think 
about 
it. 
For 
entirely 
different 
thoughts 
are 
meanwhile 
running 
through 
my 
head. 


Has 
it 
been 
noticed 
that 
music 
liberates 
the 
spirit? 
gives 
wings 
to 
thought? 
that 
one 
becomes 
more 
of 
a 
philosopher 
the 
more 
one 
becomes 
a 
musician? 


— 
The 
gray 
sky 
of 
abstraction 
rent 
as 
if 
by 
lightning; 
the 
light 
strong 
enough 
for 
the 
filigree 
of 
things; 
the 
great 
problems 
near 
enough 
to 
grasp; 
the 
world 
surveyed 
as 
from 
a 
mountain.— 
I 
have 
just 
defined 
the 
pathos 
of 
philosophy. 
— 
And 
unexpectedly 
answers 
drop 
into 
my 
lap, 
a 
little 
hail 
of 
ice 
and 
wisdom, 
of 
solved 
problems.— 
Where 
am 
I?— 
Bizet 
makes 
me 
fertile. 
Whatever 
is 
good 
makes 
me 
fertile. 
I 
have 
no 
other 
gratitude, 
nor 
do 
I 
have 
any 
other 
proof 
for 
what 
is 
good. 

2 


This 
work, 
too, 
redeems; 
Wagner 
is 
not 
the 
only 
“redeemer.” 
With 
this 
work 
one 
takes 
leave 
of 
the 
damp 
north, 
of 
all 
the 
steam 
of 
the 
Wagnerian 
ideal. 
Even 
the 
plot 
spells 
redemption 
from 
that. 
From 
Mérimée 
it 
still 
has 
the 
logic 
in 
passion, 
the 
shortest 
line, 
the 
harsh 
necessity; 
above 
all, 
it 
has 
what 
goes 
with 
the 
torrid 
zone: 
the 
dryness 
of 
the 
air, 
the 
limpidezza1 
in 
the 
air. 
In 
every 
respect, 
the 
climate 
is 
changed. 
Another 
sensuality, 
another 
sensibility 
speaks 
here, 
another 
cheerfulness. 
This 
music 
is 
cheerful, 
but 
not 
in 
a 
French 
or 
German 
way. 
Its 
cheerfulness 
is 
African; 
fate 
hangs 
over 
it; 
its 
happiness 
is 
brief, 
sudden, 
without 
pardon. 
I 
envy 
Bizet 
for 
having 
had 
the 
courage 
for 
this 
sensibility 
which 
had 
hitherto 
had 
no 
language 
in 
the 
cultivated 
music 
of 
Europe—for 
this 
more 
southern, 
brown, 
burnt 
sensibility.— 
How 
the 
yellow 
afternoons 
of 
its 
happiness 
do 
us 
good! 
We 
look 
into 
the 
distance 
as 
we 
listen: 
did 
we 
ever 
find 
the 
sea 
smoother?— 
And 
how 
soothingly 
the 
Moorish 
dance 
speaks 
to 
us? 
How 
even 
our 
insatiability 
for 
once 
gets 
to 
know 
satiety 
in 
this 
lascivious 
melancholy! 


Finally, 
love—love 
translated 
back 
into 
nature. 
Not 
the 
love 
of 
a 
“higher 
virgin”! 
No 
Senta-sentimentality!2 
But 
love 
as 
fatum, 
as 
fatality, 
cynical, 
innocent, 
cruel—and 
precisely 
in 
this 
a 
piece 
of 
nature. 
That 
love 
which 
is 
war 
in 
its 
means, 
and 
at 
bottom 
the 
deadly 
hatred 
of 
the 
sexes!— 
I 
know 
no 
case 
where 
the 
tragic 
joke 
that 
constitutes 
the 
essence 
of 
love 
is 
expressed 
so 
strictly, 
translated 
with 
equal 
terror 
into 
a 
formula, 
as 
in 
Don 
José’s 
last 
cry, 
which 
concludes 
the 
work: 


“Yes.I 
have 
killed 
her, 
I—my 
adored 
Carmen!” 


Such 
a 
conception 
of 
love 
(the 
only 
one 
worthy 
of 
a 
philosopher) 
is 
rare: 
it 
raises 
a 
work 
of 
art 
above 
thousands.3 
For 
on 
the 
average, 
artists 
do 
what 
all 
the 
world 
does, 
even 
worse—they 
misunderstand 
love. 
Wagner, 
too, 
misunderstood 
it. 
They 
believe 
one 
becomes 
selfless 
in 
love 
because 
one 
desires 
the 
advantage 
of 
another 
human 
being, 
often 
against 
one’s 
own 
advantage. 
But 
in 
return 
for 
that 
they 
want 
to 
possess 
the 
other 
person.— 



Even 
God 
does 
not 
constitute 
an 
exception 
at 
this 
point. 
He 
is 
far 
from 
thinking, 
“What 
is 
it 
to 
you 
if 
I 
love 
you?”4 
—he 
becomes 
terrible 
when 
one 
does 
not 
love 
him 
in 
return. 
L’amour—this 
saying 
remains 
true 
among 
gods 
and 
men—est 
de 
tous 
les 
sentiments 
le 
plus 
égoïste, 
et 
par 
conséquent, 
lorsqu’il 
est 
blessé, 
le 
moins 
généreux. 
(B. 
Constant.)5

You 
begin 
to 
see 
how 
much 
this 
music 
improves 
me?— 
Il 
faut 
méditerraniser 
la 
musique:1 
I 
have 
reasons 
for 
this 
formula 
(Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
Aph. 
255). 
The 
return 
to 
nature, 
health, 
cheerfulness, 
youth, 
virtue! 


— 
And 
yet 
I 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
corrupted 
Wagnerians.— 
I 
was 
capable 
of 
taking 
Wagner 
seriously.— 
Ah, 
this 
old 
magician, 
how 
much 
he 
imposed 
upon 
us! 
The 
first 
thing 
his 
art 
offers 
us 
is 
a 
magnifying 
glass: 
one 
looks 
through 
it, 
one 
does 
not 
trust 
one’s 
own 
eyes—everything 
looks 
big, 
even 
Wagner.— 
What 
a 
clever 
rattlesnake! 
It 
has 
filled 
our 
whole 
life 
with 
its 
rattling 
about 
“devotion,” 
about 
“loyalty,” 
about 
“purity”; 
and 
with 
its 
praise 
of 
chastity 
it 
withdrew 
from 
the 
corrupted 
world.— 
And 
we 
believed 
it 
in 
all 
these 
things.— 
But 
you 
do 
not 
hear 
me? 
You, 
too, 
prefer 
Wagner’s 
problem 
to 
Bizet’s? 
I, 
too, 
do 
not 
underestimate 
it; 
it 
has 
its 
peculiar 
magic. 
The 
problem 
of 
redemption 
is 
certainly 
a 
venerable 
problem. 
There 
is 
nothing 
about 
which 
Wagner 
has 
thought 
more 
deeply 
than 
redemption: 
his 
opera 
is 
the 
opera 
of 
redemption. 
Somebody 
or 
other 
always 
wants 
to 
be 
redeemed 
in 
his 
work: 
sometimes 
a 
little 
male, 
sometimes 
a 
little 
female—this 
is 
his 
problem.— 
And 
how 
richly 
he 
varies 
his 
leitmotif! 
What 
rare, 
what 
profound 
dodges! 
Who 
if 
not 
Wagner 
would 
teach 
us 
that 
innocence 
prefers 
to 
redeem 
interesting 
sinners? 
(The 
case 
in 
Tannhäuser.) 
Or 
that 
even 
the 
Wandering 
Jew 
is 
redeemed, 
settles 
down, 
when 
he 
marries? 
(The 
case 
in 
The 
Flying 
Dutchman.) 
Or 
that 
old 
corrupted 
females 
prefer 
to 
be 
redeemed 
by 
chaste 
youths? 
(The 
case 
of 
Kundry.)2 
Or 
that 
beautiful 
maidens 
like 
best 
to 
be 
redeemed 
by 
a 
knight 
who 
is 
a 
Wagnerian? 
(The 
case 
in 
Die 
Meistersinger.) 
Or 
that 
married 
women, 
too, 
enjoy 
being 
redeemed 
by 
a 
knight? 
(The 
case 
of 
Isolde.) 
Or 
that 
“the 
old 
Goa,” 
after 
having 
compromised 
himself 
morally 
in 
every 
respect, 
is 
finally 
redeemed 
by 
a 
free 
spirit 
and 
immoralist? 
(The 
case 
in 
the 
Ring.) 
Do 
admire 
this 
final 
profundity 
above 
all! 
Do 
you 
understand 
it? 
I—beware 
of 
understanding 
it. 


That 
yet 
other 
lessons 
may 
be 
learned 
from 
the 
works 
just 
named 
I’d 
sooner 
demonstrate 
than 
deny. 
That 
a 
Wagnerian 
ballet 
may 
drive 
one 
to 



despair—and 
virtue! 
(Again 
the 
case 
of 
Tannhäuser.) 
That 
it 
may 
have 
the 
direst 
consequences 
if 
one 
doesn’t 
go 
to 
bed 
at 
the 
right 
time. 
(Once 
more 
the 
case 
of 
Lohengrin.) 
That 
one 
should 
never 
know 
too 
precisely 
whom 
exactly 
one 
has 
married. 
(For 
the 
third 
time, 
the 
case 
of 
Lohengrin.) 


Tristan 
and 
Isolde 
glorifies 
the 
perfect 
spouse 
who 
in 
a 
certain 
case 
has 
only 
the 
single 
question: 
“But 
why 
didn’t 
you 
tell 
me 
this 
before? 
Nothing 
simpler 
than 
that!” 
Answer: 


“That 
I 
may 
not 
tell 
you; 
and 
what 
you 
ask 
you 
may 
never 
know.” 


Lohengrin 
contains 
a 
solemn 
excommunication 
of 
inquiry 
and 
questioning. 
Wagner 
thus 
represents 
the 
Christian 
concept, 
“you 
ought 
to 
and 
must 
believe.” 
It 
is 
a 
crime 
against 
what 
is 
highest 
and 
holiest 
to 
be 
scientific. 


The 
Flying 
Dutchman 
preaches 
the 
sublime 
doctrine 
that 
woman 
makes 
even 
the 
most 
restless 
man 
stable; 
in 
Wagnerian 
terms, 
she 
“redeems” 
him. 
Here 
we 
permit 
ourselves 
a 
question. 
Supposing 
this 
were 
true, 
would 
it 
also 
be 
desirable? 


What 
becomes 
of 
the 
“Wandering 
Jew”3 
whom 
a 
woman 
adores 
and 
makes 
stable? 
He 
merely 
ceases 
to 
be 
eternal; 
he 
gets 
married, 
he 
is 
of 
no 
further 
concern 
to 
us. 


Translated 
into 
reality: 
the 
danger 
for 
artists, 
for 
geniuses—and 
who 
else 
is 
the 
“Wandering 
Jew”?—is 
woman: 
adoring 
women 
confront 
them 
with 
corruption. 
Hardly 
any 
of 
them 
have 
character 
enough 
not 
to 
be 
corrupted— 
or 
“redeemed”—when 
they 
find 
themselves 
treated 
like 
gods: 
soon 
they 
condescend 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
women.— 
Man 
is 
a 
coward, 
confronted 
with 
the 
Eternal-Feminine4—and 
the 
females 
know 
it.— 
In 
many 
cases 
of 
feminine 
love, 
perhaps 
including 
the 
most 
famous 
ones 
above 
all, 
love 
is 
merely 
a 
more 
refined 
form 
of 
parasitism, 
a 
form 
of 
nestling 
down 
in 
another 
soul, 
sometimes 
even 
in 
the 
flesh 
of 
another—alas, 
always 
decidedly 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
“the 
host”! 


One 
knows 
Goethe’s 
fate 
in 
moraline-sour, 
old-maidish 
Germany. 
He 
always 
seemed 
offensive 
to 
Germans; 
he 
had 
honest 
admirers 
only 
among 
Jewesses. 
Schiller, 
the 
“noble” 
Schiller, 
who 
lambasted 
the 
ears 
of 
the 
Germans 
with 
big 
words—he 
was 
after 
their 
hearts. 
What 
did 
they 
hold 
against 
Goethe? 
The 
“mount 
of 
Venus”; 
and 
that 
he 
had 
written 
Venetian 



Epigrams. 
Klopstock5 
already 
felt 
called 
upon 
to 
deliver 
a 
moral 
sermon 
to 
him; 
there 
was 
a 
time 
when 
Herder6 
liked 
to 
use 
the 
word 
“Priapus” 
whenever 
he 
spoke 
of 
Goethe. 
Even 
Wilhelm 
Meister 
was 
considered 
merely 
a 
symptom 
of 
decline, 
“going 
to 
the 
dogs” 
as 
far 
as 
morals 
go. 
Niebuhr,7 
for 
example, 
was 
enraged 
by 
the 
“menagerie 
of 
tame 
animals” 
and 
the 
“worthlessness” 
of 
the 
hero, 
and 
finally 
he 
broke 
out 
into 
the 
lament, 
fit 
to 
be 
sung 
by 
Biterolf:8 
“Nothing 
could 
easily 
make 
a 
more 
painful 
impression 
than 
a 
great 
spirit 
who 
deprives 
himself 
of 
his 
wings 
and 
seeks 
virtuosity 
in 
something 
much 
inferior, 
renouncing 
what 
is 
higher.”— 
Above 
all, 
however, 
the 
higher 
virgins 
were 
indignant: 
all 
the 
petty 
courts, 
every 
kind 
of 
“Wartburg”9 
in 
Germany 
crossed 
themselves 
against 
Goethe, 
against 
the 
“unclean 
spirit” 
in 
Goethe. 


This 
is 
the 
story 
Wagner 
put 
into 
music. 
He 
redeems 
Goethe, 
that 
goes 
without 
saying; 
but 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
himself 
sides 
shrewdly 
with 
the 
higher 
virgin. 
Goethe 
is 
saved: 
a 
prayer 
saves 
him, 
a 
higher 
virgin 
lures 
him 
to 
perfection. 


What 
Goethe 
might 
have 
thought 
of 
Wagner?— 
Goethe 
once 
asked 
himself 
what 
danger 
threatened 
all 
romantics: 
the 
fatality 
of 
romanticism. 
His 
answer 
was: 
“suffocating 
of 
the 
rumination 
of 
moral 
and 
religious 
absurdities.” 
In 
brief: 
Parsifal. 


The 
philosopher 
adds 
an 
epilogue 
to 
this: 
Holiness—perhaps 
the 
last 
thing 
the 
people 
and 
women 
still 
get 
to 
see 
of 
higher 
values, 
the 
horizon 
of 
the 
ideal 
for 
all 
who 
are 
by 
nature 
myopic. 
But 
among 
philosophers 
this 
is, 
like 
every 
horizon, 
a 
mere 
case 
of 
lack 
of 
understanding, 
a 
sort 
of 
shutting 
the 
gate 
at 
the 
point 
where 
their 
world 
only 
begins—their 
danger, 
their 
ideal, 
their 
desideratum.— 
To 
say 
it 
more 
politely: 
la 
philosophie 
ne 
suffit 
pas 
au 
grand 
nombre. 
Il 
lui 
faut 
la 
sainteté.—10 



4 


I 
shall 
still 
relate 
the 
story 
of 
the 
Ring. 
It 
belongs 
here. 
It, 
too, 
is 
a 
story 
of 
redemption: 
only 
this 
time 
it 
is 
Wagner 
who 
is 
redeemed.— 


Half 
his 
life, 
Wagner 
believed 
in 
the 
Revolution 
as 
much 
as 
ever 
a 
Frenchman 
believed 
in 
it. 
He 
searched 
for 
it 
in 
the 
runic 
writing 
of 
myth, 
he 
believed 
that 
in 
Siegfried 
he 
had 
found 
the 
typical 
revolutionary. 


“Whence 
comes 
all 
misfortune 
in 
the 
world?” 
Wagner 
asked 
himself. 
From 
“old 
contracts,” 
he 
answered, 
like 
all 
revolutionary 
ideologists. 
In 
plain: 
from 
customs, 
laws, 
moralities, 
institutions, 
from 
everything 
on 
which 
the 
old 
world, 
the 
old 
society 
rests. 
“How 
can 
one 
rid 
the 
world 
of 
misfortune? 
How 
can 
one 
abolish 
the 
old 
society?” 
Only 
by 
declaring 
war 
against 
“contracts” 
(tradition, 
morality). 
That 
is 
what 
Siegfried 
does. 
He 
starts 
early, 
very 
early: 
his 
very 
genesis 
is 
a 
declaration 
of 
war 
against 
morality—he 
comes 
into 
this 
world 
through 
adultery, 
through 
incest.— 
It 
is 
not 
the 
saga 
but 
Wagner 
who 
invented 
this 
radical 
trait; 
at 
this 
point 
he 
revised 
the 
saga. 


Siegfried 
continues 
as 
he 
has 
begun: 
he 
merely 
follows 
his 
first 
impulse, 
he 
overthrows 
everything 
traditional, 
all 
reverence, 
all 
fear. 
Whatever 
displeases 
him 
he 
stabs 
to 
death. 
Without 
the 
least 
respect, 
he 
tackles 
old 
deities. 
But 
his 
main 
enterprise 
aims 
to 
emancipate 
woman—“to 
redeem 
Brunhilde.”— 
Siegfried 
and 
Brunhilde; 
the 
sacrament 
of 
free 
love; 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
golden 
age; 
the 
twilight 
of 
the 
gods 
for 
the 
old 
morality—all 
ill 
has 
been 
abolished. 


For 
a 
long 
time, 
Wagner’s 
ship 
followed 
this 
course 
gaily. 
No 
doubt, 
this 
was 
where 
Wagner 
sought 
his 
highest 
goal.— 
What 
happened? 
A 
misfortune. 
The 
ship 
struck 
a 
reef; 
Wagner 
was 
stuck. 
The 
reef 
was 
Schopenhauer’s 
philosophy; 
Wagner 
was 
stranded 
on 
a 
contrary 
world 
view. 
What 
had 
he 
transposed 
into 
music? 
Optimism. 
Wagner 
was 
ashamed. 
Even 
an 
optimism 
for 
which 
Schopenhauer 
had 
coined 
an 
evil 
epithet—infamous1 
optimism. 
He 
was 
ashamed 
a 
second 
time. 
He 
reflected 
for 
a 
long 
while, 
his 
situation 
seemed 
desperate.— 
Finally, 
a 
way 
out 
dawned 
on 
him: 
the 
reef 
on 
which 
he 
was 
shipwrecked—what 
if 
he 
interpreted 
it 
as 
the 
goal, 
as 
the 
secret 
intent, 
as 
the 
true 
significance 
of 
his 
voyage? 
To 
be 
shipwrecked 
here—that 
was 
a 
goal, 
too. 
Bene 
navigavi, 
cum 
naufragium 
feci.2 



So 
he 
translated 
the 
Ring 
into 
Schopenhauer’s 
terms. 
Everything 
goes 
wrong, 
everything 
perishes, 
the 
new 
world 
is 
as 
bad 
as 
the 
old: 
the 
nothing, 
the 
Indian 
Circe 
beckons. 


Brunhilde 
was 
initially 
supposed 
to 
take 
her 
farewell 
with 
a 
song 
in 
honor 
of 
free 
love, 
putting 
off 
the 
world 
with 
the 
hope 
for 
a 
socialist 
utopia 
in 
which 
“all 
turns 
out 
well”—but 
now 
gets 
something 
else 
to 
do. 
She 
has 
to 
study 
Schopenhauer 
first; 
she 
has 
to 
transpose 
the 
fourth 
book 
of 
The 
World 
as 
Will 
and 
Representation 
into 
verse. 
Wagner 
was 
redeemed. 


In 
all 
seriousness, 
this 
was 
a 
redemption. 
The 
benefit 
Schopenhauer 
conferred 
on 
Wagner 
is 
immeasurable. 
Only 
the 
philosopher 
of 
decadence 
gave 
to 
the 
artist 
of 
decadence—himself. 



5 


To 
the 
artist 
of 
decadence: 
there 
we 
have 
the 
crucial 
words. 
And 
here 
my 
seriousness 
begins. 
I 
am 
far 
from 
looking 
on 
guilelessly 
while 
this 
decadent 
corrupts 
our 
health—and 
music 
as 
well. 
Is 
Wagner 
a 
human 
being 
at 
all? 
Isn’t 
he 
rather 
a 
sickness? 
He 
makes 
sick 
whatever 
he 
touches—he 
has 
made 
music 
sick— 


A 
typical 
decadent 
who 
has 
a 
sense 
of 
necessity 
in 
his 
corrupted 
taste, 
who 
claims 
it 
as 
a 
higher 
taste, 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
get 
his 
corruption 
accepted 
as 
law, 
as 
progress, 
as 
fulfillment. 


And 
he 
is 
not 
resisted. 
His 
seductive 
force 
increases 
tremendously, 
smoke 
clouds 
of 
incense 
surround 
him, 
the 
misunderstandings 
about 
him 
parade 
as 
“gospel”—he 
hasn’t 
by 
any 
means 
converted 
only 
the 
poor 
in 
spirit. 


I 
feel 
the 
urge 
to 
open 
the 
windows 
a 
little. 
Air! 
More 
air!—1 


That 
people 
in 
Germany 
should 
deceive 
themselves 
about 
Wagner 
does 
not 
surprise 
me. 
The 
opposite 
would 
surprise 
me. 
The 
Germans 
have 
constructed 
a 
Wagner 
for 
themselves 
whom 
they 
can 
revere: 
they 
have 
never 
been 
psychologists; 
their 
gratitude 
consists 
in 
misunderstanding. 
But 
that 
people 
in 
Paris, 
too, 
deceive 
themselves 
about 
Wagner, 
though 
there 
they 
are 
hardly 
anything 
anymore 
except 
psychologists! 
And 
in 
St. 
Petersburg, 
where 
they 
guess 
things 
that 
aren’t 
guessed 
even 
in 
Paris! 
How 
closely 
related 
Wagner 
must 
be 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
European 
decadence 
to 
avoid 
being 
experienced 
by 
them 
as 
a 
decadent. 
He 
belongs 
to 
it: 
he 
is 
its 
protagonist, 
its 
greatest 
name. 


— 
One 
honors 
oneself 
when 
raising 
him 
to 
the 
clouds. 
For 
that 
one 
does 
not 
resist 
him, 
this 
itself 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
decadence. 
The 
instincts 
are 
weakened. 
What 
one 
ought 
to 
shun 
is 
found 
attractive. 
One 
puts 
to 
one’s 
lips 
what 
drives 
one 
yet 
faster 
into 
the 
abyss. 


Is 
an 
example 
desired? 
One 
only 
need 
observe 
the 
regimen 
that 
those 
suffering 
from 
anemia 
or 
gout 
or 
diabetes 
prescribe 
for 
themselves. 
Definition 
of 
a 
vegetarian: 
one 
who 
requires 
a 
corroborant 
diet. 
To 
sense 
that 
what 
is 
harmful 
is 
harmful, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
forbid 
oneself 
something 
harmful, 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
youth 
and 
vitality. 
The 
exhausted 
are 
attracted 
by 
what 
is 
harmful: 
the 
vegetarian 
by 
vegetables.2 
Sickness 
itself 
can 
be 
a 
stimulant 
to 
life: 
only 



one 
has 
to 
be 
healthy 
enough 
for 
this 
stimulant.3 


Wagner 
increases 
exhaustion: 
that 
is 
why 
he 
attracts 
the 
weak 
and 
exhausted. 
Oh, 
the 
rattlesnake-happiness 
of 
the 
old 
master 
when 
he 
always 
saw 
precisely 
“the 
little 
children” 
coming 
unto 
him!4 


I 
place 
this 
perspective 
at 
the 
outset: 
Wagner’s 
art 
is 
sick. 
The 
problems 
he 
presents 
on 
the 
stage—all 
of 
them 
problems 
of 
hysterics—the 
convulsive 
nature 
of 
his 
affects, 
his 
overexcited 
sensibility, 
his 
taste 
that 
required 
ever 
stronger 
spices, 
his 
instability 
which 
he 
dressed 
up 
as 
principles, 
not 
least 
of 
all 
the 
choice 
of 
his 
heroes 
and 
heroines—consider 
them 
as 
physiological 
types 
(a 
pathological 
gallery)!—all 
of 
this 
taken 
together 
represents 
a 
profile 
of 
sickness 
that 
permits 
no 
further 
doubt. 
Wagner 
est 
une 
névrose.5 
Perhaps 
nothing 
is 
better 
known 
today, 
at 
least 
nothing 
has 
been 
better 
studied, 
than 
the 
Protean 
character 
of 
degeneration 
that 
here 
conceals 
itself 
in 
the 
chrysalis 
of 
art 
and 
artist. 
Our 
physicians 
and 
physiologists 
confront 
their 
most 
interesting 
case 
in 
Wagner, 
at 
least 
a 
very 
complete 
case. 
Precisely 
because 
nothing 
is 
more 
modern 
than 
this 
total 
sickness, 
this 
lateness 
and 
overexcitement 
of 
the 
nervous 
mechanism, 
Wagner 
is 
the 
modern 
artist 
par 
excellence, 
the 
Cagliostro 
of 
modernity. 
In 
his 
art 
all 
that 
the 
modern 
world 
requires 
most 
urgently 
is 
mixed 
in 
the 
most 
seductive 
manner: 
the 
three 
great 
stimulantia 
of 
the 
exhausted—the 
brutal, 
the 
artificial, 
and 
the 
innocent 
(idiotic).6 


Wagner 
represents 
a 
great 
corruption 
of 
music. 
He 
has 
guessed 
that 
it 
is 
a 
means 
to 
excite 
weary 
nerves—and 
with 
that 
he 
has 
made 
music 
sick. 
His 
inventiveness 
is 
not 
inconsiderable 
in 
the 
art 
of 
goading 
again 
those 
who 
are 
weariest, 
calling 
back 
into 
life 
those 
who 
are 
half 
dead. 
He 
is 
a 
master 
of 
hypnotic 
tricks, 
he 
manages 
to 
throw 
down 
the 
strongest 
like 
bulls. 
Wagner’s 
success—his 
success 
with 
nerves 
and 
consequently 
women—has 
turned 
the 
whole 
world 
of 
ambitious 
musicians 
into 
disciples 
of 
his 
secret 
art, 
And 
not 
only 
the 
ambitious, 
the 
clever, 
too.— 
Only 
sick 
music 
makes 
money 
today; 
our 
big 
theaters 
subsist 
on 
Wagner. 



6 


I 
permit 
myself 
some 
exhilaration 
again. 
Suppose 
it 
were 
the 
case 
that 
Wagner’s 
success 
became 
incarnate, 
took 
human 
form 
and, 
dressed 
up 
as 
a 
philanthropic 
music 
scholar, 
mixed 
with 
young 
artists. 
How 
do 
you 
suppose 
he 
would 
talk? 


My 
friends, 
he 
would 
say, 
let 
us 
have 
a 
few 
words 
among 
ourselves. 
It 
is 
easier 
to 
write 
bad 
music 
than 
good. 
What 
if 
it 
were 
more 
profitable, 
too? 
more 
effective, 
persuasive, 
inspiring, 
reliable—Wagnerian?—Pulchrum 
est 
paucorum 
hominum.1 
Bad 
enough. 
We 
understand 
Latin; 
perhaps 
we 
also 
understand 
our 
own 
advantage. 
What 
is 
beautiful 
has 
a 
fly 
in 
its 
ointment: 
we 
know 
that. 
Why, 
then, 
have 
beauty? 
Why 
not 
rather 
that 
which 
is 
great, 
sublime, 
gigantic—that 
which 
moves 
masses?— 
Once 
more: 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
be 
gigantic 
than 
to 
be 
beautiful; 
we 
know 
that. 


We 
know 
the 
masses, 
we 
know 
the 
theater. 
The 
best 
among 
those 
who 
sit 
there—German 
youths, 
horned 
Siegfrieds, 
and 
other 
Wagnerians—require 
the 
sublime, 
the 
profound, 
the 
overwhelming. 
That 
much 
we 
are 
capable 
of. 
And 
the 
others 
who 
also 
sit 
there—the 
culture 
crétins, 
the 
petty 
snobs, 
the 
eternally 
feminine, 
those 
with 
a 
happy 
digestion, 
in 
sum, 
the 
people—also 
require 
the 
sublime, 
the 
profound, 
the 
overwhelming. 
They 
all 
have 
the 
same 
logic. 
“Whoever 
throws 
us 
is 
strong; 
whoever 
elevates 
us 
is 
divine; 
whoever 
leads 
us 
to 
have 
intimations 
is 
profound.”— 
Let 
us 
make 
up 
our 
minds, 
honored 
musicians: 
we 
want 
to 
throw 
them, 
we 
want 
to 
elevate 
them, 
we 
want 
to 
lead 
them 
to 
have 
intimations. 
That 
much 
we 
are 
capable 
of. 


Regarding 
the 
matter 
of 
inducing 
intimations: 
this 
is 
the 
point 
of 
departure 
for 
our 
concept 
of 
“style.” 
Above 
all, 
no 
thought! 
Nothing 
is 
more 
compromising 
than 
a 
thought. 
Rather 
the 
state 
preceding 
thought, 
the 
throng 
of 
yet 
unborn 
thoughts, 
the 
promise 
of 
future 
thoughts, 
the 
world 
as 
it 
was 
before 
God 
created 
it—a 
recrudescence 
of 
chaos.— 
Chaos 
induces 
intimations. 


Secondly, 
as 
far 
as 
throwing 
people 
is 
concerned, 
this 
really 


To 
speak 
in 
the 
language 
of 
the 
master: 
infinity, 
but 
without 
melody. 
belongs 
partly 
in 
physiology. 
Let 
us 
study 
the 
instruments 
above 
all. 
Some 
of 



them 
persuade 
even 
the 
intestines 
(they 
open 
the 
gates, 
as 
Handel 
put 
it); 
others 
bewitch 
the 
marrow 
of 
the 
spine. 
The 
color 
of 
the 
tone 
is 
decisive; 
what 
it 
is 
that 
resounds 
is 
almost 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference. 
This 
is 
the 
point 
to 
refine. 
Why 
squander 
ourselves? 
Regarding 
the 
tone, 
let 
us 
be 
characteristic 
to 
the 
point 
of 
folly. 
People 
will 
give 
credit 
to 
our 
spirit 
if 
our 
tones 
seem 
to 
pose 
many 
riddles. 
Let 
us 
agitate 
the 
nerves, 
let 
us 
slay 
them, 
let 
us 
handle 
lightning 
and 
thunder—that 
will 
throw 
them.— 


Above 
all, 
however, 
passion 
throws 
people.— 
Let 
us 
reach 
an 
understanding 
about 
passion. 
Nothing 
is 
cheaper 
than 
passion. 
One 
can 
dispense 
with 
all 
the 
virtues 
of 
counterpoint, 
one 
need 
not 
have 
learned 
a 
thing—passion 
is 
one 
ability 
we 
always 
have. 
Beauty 
is 
difficult: 
beware 
of 
beaufy!— 
And 
melody! 
Slander, 
my 
friends, 
let 
us 
slander, 
if 
we 
are 
at 
all 
serious 
about 
our 
ideal, 
let 
us 
slander 
melody! 
Nothing 
is 
more 
dangerous 
than 
a 
beautiful 
melody. 
Nothing 
corrupts 
taste 
more 
surely. 
We 
are 
lost, 
my 
friends, 
once 
beautiful 
melodies 
are 
loved 
again!— 


Principle: 
melody 
is 
immoral. 
Proof: 
Palestrina. 
Practical 
application: 
Parsifal. 
The 
lack 
of 
melody 
even 
sanctifies.— 


And 
this 
is 
the 
definition 
of 
passion. 
Passion—or 
the 
gymnastics 
of 
what 
is 
ugly 
on 
the 
rope 
of 
enharmonics.— 
Let 
us 
dare, 
my 
friends, 
to 
be 
ugly. 
Wagner 
has 
dared 
it. 
Let 
us 
dauntlessly 
roll 
in 
front 
of 
us 
the 
mud 
of 
the 
most 
contrary 
harmonies. 
Let 
us 
not 
spare 
our 
hands. 
Only 
thus 
will 
we 
become 
natural. 


A 
final 
bit 
of 
advice! 
Perhaps 
it 
includes 
everything 
else. 
Let 
us 
be 
idealists! 
This 
is, 
if 
not 
the 
cleverest 
thing 
we 
can 
do 
at 
least 
the 
wisest. 
To 
elevate2 
men 
one 
has 
to 
be 
sublime3 
oneself. 
Let 
us 
walk 
on 
clouds, 
let 
us 
harangue 
the 
infinite, 
let 
us 
surround 
ourselves 
with 
symbols! 
Sursum! 
Bumbum!—there 
is 
no 
better 
advice. 
The 
“swelled 
bosom” 
shall 
be 
our 
argument, 
the 
beautiful 
sentiment 
our 
advocate. 
Virtue 
prevails 
even 
over 
counterpoint. 
“Whoever 
makes 
us 
better 
cannot 
fail 
to 
be 
good 
himself”: 
thus 
mankind 
has 
always 
inferred. 
So 
let 
us 
improve 
mankind!4 
Thus 
one 
becomes 
good 
(thus 
one 
even 
becomes 
a 
“classic”5 
—Schiller 
became 
a 
“classic”). 
The 
hunt 
for 
low 
excitement 
of 
the 
senses, 
for 
so-called 
beauty, 
has 
enervated 
the 
Italians: 
let 
us 
remain 
German! 
Even 
Mozart’s 
attitude 
to 
music 
was—as 
Wagner 
said 
to 
comfort 
us—at 
bottom 
frivolous. 


Let 
us 
never 
admit 
that 
music 
“serves 
recreation”; 
that 
it 
“exhilarates”; 
that 
it 
“gives 
pleasure.” 
Let 
us 
never 
give 
pleasure! 
We 
are 
lost 
as 
soon 
as 
art 
is 
again 
thought 
of 
hedonistically.— 
That 
is 
bad 
eighteenth 
century.— 
Nothing 



on 
the 
other 
hand 
should 
be 
more 
advisable 
than 
a 
dose 
of—hypocrisy, 
sit 
venia 
verbo.6 
That 
lends 
dignity.— 
And 
let 
us 
choose 
the 
hour 
when 
it 
is 
decent 
to 
look 
black, 
to 
heave 
sighs 
publicly, 
to 
heave 
Christian 
sighs, 
to 
make 
an 
exhibition 
of 
great 
Christian 
pity. 
“Man 
is 
corrupt: 
who 
redeems 
him? 
what 
redeems 
him?”— 
Let 
us 
not 
answer. 
Let 
us 
be 
cautious. 
Let 
us 
resist 
our 
ambition 
which 
would 
found 
religions. 
But 
nobody 
may 
doubt 
that 
we 
redeem 
him, 
that 
our 
music 
alone 
saves.— 
(Wagner’s 
essay, 
Religion 
and 
Art.) 



7 


Enough! 
Enough! 
My 
cheerful 
strokes, 
I 
fear, 
may 
have 
revealed 
sinister 
reality 
all 
too 
clearly—the 
picture 
of 
a 
decay 
of 
art, 
a 
decay 
of 
the 
artists 
as 
well. 
The 
latter, 
the 
decay 
of 
a 
character, 
could 
perhaps 
find 
preliminary 
expression 
in 
this 
formula: 
the 
musician 
now 
becomes 
an 
actor, 
his 
art 
develops 
more 
and 
more 
as 
a 
talent 
to 
lie. 
I 
shall 
have 
an 
opportunity 
(in 
a 
chapter 
of 
my 
main 
work, 
entitled 
“Toward 
a 
Physiology 
of 
Art”)1 
to 
show 
in 
more 
detail 
how 
this 
over-all 
change 
of 
art 
into 
histrionics 
is 
no 
less 
an 
expression 
of 
physiological 
degeneration 
(more 
precisely, 
a 
form 
of 
hystericism) 
than 
every 
single 
corruption 
and 
infirmity 
of 
the 
art 
inaugurated 
by 
Wagner: 
for 
example, 
the 
visual 
restlessness 
which 
requires 
one 
continually 
to 
change 
one’s 
position. 
One 
doesn’t 
understand 
a 
thing 
about 
Wagner 
as 
long 
as 
one 
finds 
in 
him 
merely 
an 
arbitrary 
play 
of 
nature, 
a 
whim, 
an 
accident. 
He 
was 
no 
“fragmentary,” 
“hapless,” 
or 
“contradictory” 
genius, 
as 
people 
have 
said. 
Wagner 
was 
something 
perfect, 
a 
typical 
decadent 
in 
whom 
there 
is 
no 
trace 
of 
“free 
will” 
and 
in 
whom 
every 
feature 
is 
necessary. 
If 
anything 
in 
Wagner 
is 
interesting 
it 
is 
the 
logic 
with 
which 
a 
physiological 
defect 
makes 
move 
upon 
move 
and 
takes 
step 
upon 
step 
as 
practice 
and 
procedure, 
as 
innovation 
in 
principles, 
as 
a 
crisis 
in 
taste. 


For 
the 
present 
I 
merely 
dwell 
on 
the 
question 
of 
style.— 
What 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
every 
literary 
decadence? 
That 
life 
no 
longer 
dwells 
in 
the 
whole. 
The 
word 
becomes 
sovereign 
and 
leaps 
out 
of 
the 
sentence, 
the 
sentence 
reaches 
out 
and 
obscures 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
page, 
the 
page 
gains 
life 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
whole—the 
whole 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
whole.2 
But 
this 
is 
the 
simile 
of 
every 
style 
of 
decadence: 
every 
time, 
the 
anarchy 
of 
atoms, 
disgregation 
of 
the 
will, 
“freedom 
of 
the 
individual,” 
to 
use 
moral 
terms—expanded 
into 
a 
political 
theory, 
“equal 
rights 
for 
all.” 
Life, 
equal 
vitality, 
the 
vibration 
and 
exuberance 
of 
life 
pushed 
back 
into 
the 
smallest 
forms; 
the 
rest, 
poor 
in 
life. 
Everywhere 
paralysis, 
arduousness, 
torpidity 
or 
hostility 
and 
chaos: 
both 
more 
and 
more 
obvious 
the 
higher 
one 
ascends 
in 
forms 
of 
organization. 
The 
whole 
no 
longer 
lives 
at 
all: 
it 
is 
composite, 
calculated, 
artificial, 
and 
artifact. 
— 



Wagner 
begins 
from 
a 
hallucination—not 
of 
sounds 
but 
of 
gestures. 
Then 
he 
seeks 
the 
sign 
language 
of 
sounds 
for 
them. 
If 
one 
would 
admire 
him, 
one 
should 
watch 
him 
at 
work 
at 
this 
point: 
how 
he 
separates, 
how 
he 
gains 
small 
units, 
how 
he 
animates 
these, 
severs 
them, 
and 
makes 
them 
visible. 
But 
this 
exhausts 
his 
strength: 
the 
rest 
is 
no 
good. 
How 
wretched, 
how 
embarrassed, 
how 
amateurish 
is 
his 
manner 
of 
“development,” 
his 
attempt 
to 
at 
least 
interlard 
what 
has 
not 
grown 
out 
of 
each 
other. 
His 
manners 
recall 
those 
of 
the 
frères 
de 
Goncourt,3 
who 
are 
quite 
generally 
pertinent 
to 
Wagner’s 
style: 
one 
feels 
a 
kind 
of 
compassion 
for 
so 
much 
distress. 
That 
Wagner 
disguised 
as 
a 
principle 
his 
incapacity 
for 
giving 
organic 
form, 
that 
he 
establishes 
a 
“dramatic 
style” 
where 
we 
merely 
establish 
his 
incapacity 
for 
any 
style 
whatever, 
this 
is 
in 
line 
with 
a 
bold 
habit 
that 
accompanied 
Wagner 
through 
his 
whole 
life: 
he 
posits 
a 
principle 
where 
he 
lacks 
a 
capacity 
(—very 
different 
in 
this 
respect, 
incidentally, 
from 
the 
old 
Kant 
who 
preferred 
another 
boldness: 
wherever 
he 
lacked 
a 
principle 
he 
posited 
a 
special 
human 
capacity).4 


Once 
more: 
Wagner 
is 
admirable 
and 
gracious 
only 
in 
the 
invention 
of 
what 
is 
smallest, 
in 
spinning 
out 
the 
details. 
Here 
one 
is 
entirely 
justified 
in 
proclaiming 
him 
a 
master 
of 
the 
first 
rank, 
as 
our 
greatest 
miniaturist 
in 
music 
who 
crowds 
into 
the 
smallest 
space 
an 
infinity 
of 
sense 
and 
sweetness. 
His 
wealth 
of 
colors, 
of 
half 
shadows, 
of 
the 
secrecies 
of 
dying 
light 
spoils 
one 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
afterward 
almost 
all 
other 
musicians 
seem 
too 
robust. 


If 
one 
would 
believe 
me 
one 
should 
have 
to 
derive 
the 
highest 
conception 
of 
Wagner 
not 
from 
what 
is 
liked 
about 
him 
today. 
That 
has 
been 
invented 
to 
persuade 
the 
masses; 
from 
that 
we 
recoil 
as 
from 
an 
all 
too 
impudent 
fresco.5 
Of 
what 
concern 
to 
us 
is 
the 
agaçant6 
brutality 
of 
the 
Tannhäuser 
Overture. 
Or 
the 
circus 
of 
Walküre? 
Whatever 
of 
Wagner’s 
music 
has 
become 
popular 
also 
apart 
from 
the 
theater 
shows 
dubious 
taste 
and 
corrupts 
taste. 
The 
Tannhäuser 
March 
I 
suspect 
of 
bonhommerie;7 
the 
overture 
of 
The 
Flying 
Dutchman 
is 
noise 
about 
nothing;8 
the 
Lohengrin 
Prelude 
furnished 
the 
first 
example, 
only 
too 
insidious, 
only 
too 
successful, 
of 
hypnotism 
by 
means 
of 
music 
(—I 
do 
not 
like 
whatever 
music 
has 
no 
ambition 
beyond 
persuasion 
of 
the 
nerves). 
But 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
magnétiseur9 
and 
fresco-painter 
Wagner, 
there 
is 
another 
Wagner 
who 
lays 
aside 
small 
gems: 
our 
greatest 
melan-choliac 
in 
music, 
full 
of 
glances, 
tendernesses, 
and 
comforting 
words 



in 
which 
nobody 
has 
anticipated 
him, 
the 
master 
in 
tones 
of 
a 
heavy-hearted 
and 
drowsy 
happiness. 


A 
lexicon 
of 
Wagner’s 
most 
intimate 
words, 
all 
of 
them 
short 
things 
of 
five 
to 
fifteen 
measures, 
all 
of 
it 
music 
nobody 
knows.— 
Wagner 
had 
the 
virtue 
of 
decadents: 
pity. 



8 


“Very 
good. 
But 
how 
can 
one 
lose 
a 
taste 
for 
this 
decadent 
if 
one 
does 
not 
happen 
to 
be 
a 
musician, 
if 
one 
does 
not 
happen 
to 
be 
a 
decadent 
oneself?” 


On 
the 
contrary, 
how 
can 
one 
fail 
to 
do 
it? 
Just 
try 
it.— 
You 
do 
not 
know 
who 
Wagner 
is: 
a 
first-rate 
actor. 
Is 
a 
more 
profound, 
a 
weightier 
effect 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
theater? 
Just 
look 
at 
these 
youths—rigid, 
pale, 
breathless! 
These 
are 
the 
Wagnerians: 
they 
understand 
nothing 
about 
music—and 
yet 
Wagner 
becomes 
master 
over 
them.— 
Wagner’s 
art 
has 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
hundred 
atmospheres: 
stoop! 
what 
else 
can 
one 
do? 


The 
actor 
Wagner 
is 
a 
tyrant; 
his 
pathos 
topples 
every 
taste, 
every 
resistance.— 
Who 
equals 
the 
persuasive 
power 
of 
these 
gestures? 
Who 
else 
envisages 
gestures 
with 
such 
assurance, 
so 
clearly 
from 
the 
start? 
The 
way 
Wagner’s 
pathos 
holds 
its 
breath, 
refuses 
to 
let 
go 
an 
extreme 
feeling, 
achieves 
a 
terrifying 
duration 
of 
states 
when 
even 
a 
moment 
threatens 
to 
strangle 
us— 


Was 
Wagner 
a 
musician 
at 
all? 
At 
any 
rate, 
there 
was 
something 
else 
that 
he 
was 
more: 
namely, 
an 
incomparable 
histrio,1 
the 
greatest 
mime, 
the 
most 
amazing 
genius 
of 
the 
theater 
ever 
among 
Germans, 
our 
scenic 
artist 
par 
excellence. 
He 
belongs 
elsewhere, 
not 
in 
the 
history 
of 
music: 
one 
should 
not 
confuse 
him 
with 
the 
genuine 
masters 
of 
that. 
Wagner 
and 
Beethoven—that 
is 
blasphemy 
and 
really 
wrongs 
even 
Wagner.— 
As 
a 
musician, 
too, 
he 
was 
only 
what 
he 
was 
in 
general: 
he 
became 
a 
musician, 
he 
became 
a 
poet 
because 
the 
tyrant 
within 
him, 
his 
actor’s 
genius, 
compelled 
him. 
One 
cannot 
begin 
to 
figure 
out 
Wagner 
until 
one 
figures 
out 
his 
dominant 
instinct. 


Wagner 
was 
not 
a 
musician 
by 
instinct. 
He 
showed 
this 
by 
abandoning 
all 
lawfulness 
and, 
more 
precisely, 
all 
style 
in 
music 
in 
order 
to 
turn 
it 
into 
what 
he 
required, 
theatrical 
rhetoric, 
a 
means 
of 
expression, 
of 
underscoring 
gestures, 
of 
suggestion, 
of 
the 
psychologically 
picturesque. 
Here 
we 
may 
consider 
Wagner 
an 
inventor 
and 
innovator 
of 
the 
first 
rank—he 
has 
increased 
music’s 
capacity 
for 
language 
to 
the 
point 
of 
making 
it 
immeasurable: 
he 
is 
the 
Victor 
Hugo 
of 
music 
as 
language. 
Always 
presupposing 
that 
one 
first 
allows 
that 
under 
certain 
circumstances 
music 



may 
be 
not 
music 
but 
language, 
instrument, 
ancilla2 
dramaturgica. 
Wagner’s 
music, 
if 
not 
shielded 
by 
theater 
taste, 
which 
is 
a 
very 
tolerant 
taste, 
is 
simply 
bad 
music, 
perhaps 
the 
worst 
ever 
made. 
When 
a 
musician 
can 
no 
longer 
count 
up 
to 
three 
he 
becomes 
“dramatic,” 
he 
becomes 
“Wagnerian.” 


Wagner 
almost 
discovered 
how 
much 
magic 
is 
still 
possible 
with 
music 
that 
has 
been 
dissolved 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
made 
elementary. 
His 
consciousness 
of 
that 
is 
downright 
uncanny, 
no 
less 
than 
his 
instinctive 
realization 
that 
he 
simply 
did 
not 
require 
the 
higner 
lawfulness, 
style. 
What 
is 
elementary 
is 
sufficient—sound, 
movement, 
color, 
in 
brief 
the 
sensuousness 
of 
music. 
Wagner 
never 
calculates 
as 
a 
musician, 
from 
some 
sort 
of 
musician’s 
conscience: 
what 
he 
wants 
is 
effect, 
nothing 
but 
effect. 
And 
he 
knows 
those 
on 
whom 
he 
wants 
to 
achieve 
his 
effects.— 
At 
this 
point 
he 
is 
as 
free 
from 
qualms 
as 
Schiller 
was, 
as 
every 
man 
of 
the 
theater 
is, 
and 
he 
also 
has 
the 
same 
contempt 
for 
the 
world 
which 
he 
prostrates 
at 
his 
feet.— 
One 
is 
an 
actor 
by 
virtue 
of 
being 
ahead 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
mankind 
in 
one 
insight: 
what 
is 
meant 
to 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
truth 
must 
not 
be 
true. 
The 
proposition 
was 
formulated 
by 
Talma;3 
it 
contains 
the 
whole 
psychology 
of 
the 
actor; 
it 
also 
contains— 
we 
need 
not 
doubt 
it—his 
morality. 
Wagner’s 
music 
is 
never 
true. 


But 
it 
is 
taken 
for 
true; 
and 
thus 
it 
is 
in 
order. 


As 
long 
as 
we 
are 
still 
childlike, 
and 
Wagnerians 
as 
well, 
we 
consider 
Wagner 
himself 
rich, 
even 
as 
a 
paragon 
of 
a 
squanderer, 
even 
as 
the 
owner 
of 
huge 
estates 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
sound. 
He 
is 
admired 
for 
what 
young 
Frenchmen 
admire 
in 
Victor 
Hugo, 
“the 
royal 
largesse.” 
Later 
one 
comes 
to 
admire 
both 
of 
them 
for 
the 
opposite 
reasons: 
as 
masters 
and 
models 
of 
economy, 
as 
shrewd 
hosts. 
Nobody 
equals 
their 
talent 
for 
presenting 
a 
princely 
table 
at 
modest 
expense. 


The 
Wagnerian, 
with 
his 
believer’s 
stomach, 
actually 
feels 
sated 
by 
the 
fare 
his 
master’s 
magic 
evokes 
for 
him. 
The 
rest 
of 
us, 
demanding 
substance 
above 
all 
else, 
in 
books 
as 
well 
as 
in 
music, 
are 
scarcely 
taken 
care 
of 
by 
merely 
“represented” 
tables 
and 
hence 
are 
much 
worse 
off. 
To 
say 
it 
plainly: 
Wagner 
does 
not 
give 
us 
enough 
to 
chew 
on. 
His 
recitativo—little 
meat, 
rather 
more 
bone, 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
broth—I 
have 
called 
“alla 
genovese”— 
without 
the 
least 
intention 
of 
flattering 
the 
Genoese, 
but 
rather 
the 
older 
recitativo, 
the 
recitativo 
secco.4 


Finally, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Wagnerian 
“leitmotif” 
is 
concerned, 
I 
lack 
all 
culinary 
understanding 
for 
that. 
If 
pressed, 
I 
might 
possibly 
concede 
it 
the 
status 
of 
an 
ideal 
toothpick, 
as 
an 
opportunity 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
remainders 
of 
food. 
There 



remain 
the 
“arias” 
of 
Wagner.— 
And 
now 
I 
shall 
not 
say 
another 
word. 



9 


In 
projecting 
his 
plot, 
too, 
Wagner 
is 
above 
all 
an 
actor. 
What 
he 
envisages 
first 
is 
a 
scene 
whose 
effectiveness 
is 
absolutely 
safe, 
a 
genuine 
actio* 
with 
an 
hautrelief 
of 
gestures, 
a 
scene 
that 
throws 
people—this 
he 
thinks 
through 
in 
depth, 
and 
from 
this 
he 
then 
derives 
the 
characters. 
All 
the 
rest 
follows 
from 
this, 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
technical 
economy 
that 
has 
no 
reasons 
for 
being 
subtle. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
public 
of 
Corneille 
of 
whom 
Wagner 
has 
to 
be 
considerate, 
but 
mere 
nineteenth 
century. 
About 
“the 
one 
thing 
needful” 
Wagner 
would 
think 
approximately 
the 
way 
any 
other 
actor 
today 
thinks 
about 
it: 
a 
series 
of 
strong 
scenes, 
one 
stronger 
than 
the 
other—and 
in 
between 
much 
shrewd 
stupidity. 
To 
begin 
with, 
he 
tries 
to 
guarantee 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
his 
work 
to 
himself; 
he 
starts 
with 
the 
third 
act; 
he 
proves 
his 
work 
to 
himself 
by 
means 
of 
its 
ultimate 
effect. 
With 
such 
a 
sense 
of 
the 
theater 
for 
one’s 
guide, 
one 
is 
in 
no 
danger 
of 
unexpectedly 
creating 
a 
drama. 
Drama 
requires 
rigorous 
logic: 
but 
what 
did 
Wagner 
ever 
care 
about 
logic? 
To 
say 
it 
once 
more: 
it 
was 
not 
the 
public 
of 
Corneille 
of 
whom 
Wagner 
had 
to 
be 
considerate—but 
mere 
Germans. 


We 
know 
which 
technical 
problem 
requires 
all 
of 
the 
dramatist’s 
powers 
and 
often 
makes 
him 
sweat 
blood: 
making 
the 
knot 
necessary, 
and 
the 
resolution 
as 
well, 
so 
both 
will 
be 
possible 
in 
one 
way 
only 
while 
giving 
the 
impression 
of 
freedom 
(the 
principle 
of 
the 
least 
exertion 
of 
energy). 
That, 
however, 
leads 
Wagner 
least 
of 
all 
to 
sweat 
blood; 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
he 
exerted 
the 
least 
energy 
on 
the 
knot 
and 
its 
resolution. 
Take 
any 
of 
Wagner’s 
“knots” 
and 
examine 
it 
under 
the 
microscope—and 
you’ll 
have 
to 
laugh, 
I 
promise 
you. 
Nothing 
is 
more 
amusing 
than 
the 
knot 
of 
Tristan, 
unless 
it 
is 
the 
knot 
of 
the 
Meistersinger. 


Wagner 
is 
no 
dramatist; 
don’t 
be 
imposed 
upon! 
He 
loved 
the 
word 
“drama”—that’s 
all; 
he 
always 
loved 
pretty 
words. 
The 
word 
“drama” 
in 
his 
writings 
is 
nevertheless 
a 
mere 
misunderstanding 
(and 
a 
bit 
of 
shrewdness: 
Wagner 
always 
affected 
superiority 
over 
the 
word 
“opera”)—much 
the 
way 
the 
word 
“spirit” 
in 
the 
New 
Testament 
is 
a 
mere 
misunderstanding. 


For 
one 
thing, 
he 
was 
not 
enough 
of 
a 
psychologist 
for 
drama; 



instinctively, 
he 
avoided 
psychological 
motivation—how? 
by 
always 
putting 
idiosyncrasy 
in 
its 
place.— 
Very 
modern, 
isn’t 
it? 
Very 
Parisian. 
Very 
decadent. 


Incidentally, 
the 
knots 
that 
Wagner 
really 
could 
resolve 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
dramatic 
inventions 
were 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
nature. 
I 
offer 
an 
example. 
Assume 
a 
case 
in 
which 
Wagner 
requires 
a 
female 
voice. 
An 
entire 
act 
without 
a 
female 
voice—impossible! 
But 
none 
of 
the 
“heroines” 
are 
free 
at 
the 
moment. 
What 
does 
Wagner 
do? 
He 
emancipates 
the 
oldest 
woman 
of 
the 
world, 
Erda: 
“Come 
up, 
old 
grandmother! 
You 
have 
to 
sing.” 
Erda 
sings. 
Wagner’s 
purpose 
is 
realized. 
Immediately 
he 
abolishes 
the 
old 
lady 
again. 
“Why 
ever 
did 
you 
come? 
Beat 
it. 
Go 
on 
sleeping.”— 
In 
summa: 
a 
scene 
full 
of 
mythological 
shivers 
which 
gives 
Wagnerians 
intimations.— 


“But 
the 
content 
of 
the 
Wagnerian 
texts! 
their 
mythic 
content! 
their 
eternal 
content!”— 
Question: 
how 
can 
we 
test 
this 
content, 
this 
eternal 
content?— 
The 
chemist 
replies: 
translate 
Wagner 
into 
reality, 
into 
the 
modern—let 
us 
be 
even 
crueler—into 
the 
bourgeois! 
What 
becomes 
of 
Wagner 
then?— 
Among 
ourselves, 
I 
have 
tried 
it. 
Nothing 
is 
more 
entertaining, 
nothing 
to 
be 
recommended 
more 
highly 
for 
walks, 
than 
retelling 
Wagner 
in 
more 
youthful 
proportions: 
for 
example, 
Parsifal 
as 
a 
candidate 
for 
a 
theological 
degree, 
with 
secondary 
school 
education 
(the 
latter 
being 
indispensable 
for 
pure 
foolishness). 
What 
surprises 
one 
encounters 
in 
the 
process! 
Would 
you 
believe 
it? 
All 
of 
Wagner’s 
heroines, 
without 
exception, 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
are 
stripped 
of 
their 
heroic 
skin, 
become 
almost 
indistinguishable 
from 
Madame 
Bovary! 
And 
conversely 
one 
understands 
that 
Flaubert 
could 
have 
translated 
his 
heroine 
into 
Scandinavian 
or 
Carthaginian 
terms 
and 
then 
offered 
her, 
mythologized, 
to 
Wagner 
as 
a 
libretto. 
Indeed, 
transposed 
into 
hugeness, 
Wagner 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
have 
been 
interested 
in 
any 
problems 
except 
those 
which 
now 
preoccupy 
the 
little 
decadents 
of 
Paris. 
Always 
five 
steps 
from 
the 
hospital. 
All 
of 
them 
entirely 
modern, 
entirely 
metropolitan 
problems. 
Don’t 
doubt 
it. 


Have 
you 
ever 
noticed 
(it 
belongs 
with 
this 
association 
of 
ideas) 
that 
Wagner’s 
heroines 
never 
have 
children?— 
They 
can’t.— 
The 
despair 
with 
which 
Wagner 
tackled 
the 
problem 
of 
having 
Siegfried 
born 
at 
all 
shows 
how 
modern 
his 
feelings 
were 
at 
this 
point.— 
Siegfried 
“emancipates 
woman”— 
but 
without 
any 
hope 
of 
progeny.— 
One 
fact, 
finally, 
which 
leaves 
us 
dumfounded: 
Parsifal 
is 
the 
father 
of 
Lohengrin. 
How 
did 
he 
do 
it?— 
Must 
one 
remember 
at 
this 
point 
that 
“chastity 
works 
miracles”?— 



Wagner 
us 
dixit 
princeps 
in 
castitate 
auctoritas.1 



10 


Incidentally, 
a 
word 
about 
Wagner’s 
writings: 
they 
offer, 
among 
other 
things, 
a 
course 
in 
shrewdness. 
The 
system 
of 
procedures 
that 
Wagner 
handles 
is 
applicable 
to 
a 
hundred 
other 
cases: 
let 
him 
who 
has 
ears 
hear. 
Perhaps 
I 
shall 
be 
entitled 
to 
public 
gratitude 
if 
I 
formulate 
the 
three 
most 
valuable 
procedures 
with 
some 
precision. 


Everything 
Wagner 
can 
not 
do 
is 
reprehensible. 


There 
is 
much 
else 
Wagner 
could 
do: 
but 
he 
doesn’t 
want 
to, 
from 
rigorism 
in 
principle. 


Everything 
Wagner 
can 
do, 
nobody 
will 
be 
able 
to 
do 
after 
him, 
nobody 
has 
done 
before 
him, 
nobody 
shall 
do 
after 
him.— 
Wagner 
is 
divine. 


These 
three 
propositions 
are 
the 
quintessence 
of 
Wagner’s 
literature; 
the 
rest 
is—mere 
“literature.” 


Not 
every 
music 
so 
far 
has 
required 
a 
literature: 
one 
ought 
to 
look 
for 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
here. 
Is 
it 
that 
Wagner’s 
music 
is 
too 
difficult 
to 
understand? 
Or 
is 
he 
afraid 
of 
the 
opposite, 
that 
it 
might 
be 
understood 
too 
easily—that 
one 
will 
not 
find 
it 
difficult 
enough 
to 
understand? 


As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
he 
repeated 
a 
single 
proposition 
all 
his 
life 
long: 
that 
his 
music 
did 
not 
mean 
mere 
music. 
But 
more. 
But 
infinitely 
more.— 
“Not 
mere 
music”—no 
musician 
would 
say 
that. 
To 
say 
it 
once 
more, 
Wagner 
was 
unable 
to 
create 
from 
a 
totality; 
he 
had 
no 
choice, 
he 
had 
to 
make 
patchwork, 
“motifs,” 
gestures, 
formulas, 
doing 
things 
double 
and 
even 
a 
hundredfold— 
he 
remained 
an 
orator 
even 
as 
a 
musician—he 
therefore 
had 
to 
move 
his 
“it 
means” 
into 
the 
foreground 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle. 
“Music 
is 
always 
a 
mere 
means”: 
that 
was 
his 
theory, 
that 
above 
all 
the 
only 
practice 
open 
to 
him. 
But 
no 
musician 
would 
think 
that 
way. 


Wagner 
required 
literature 
to 
persuade 
all 
the 
world 
to 
take 
his 
music 
seriously, 
to 
take 
it 
as 
profound 
“because 
its 
meaning 
was 
infinite”; 
he 
was 
his 
life 
long 
the 
commentator 
of 
the 
“idea.”— 
What 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
Elsa? 
But 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
about 
that: 
Elsa 
is 
“the 
unconscious 
spirit 
of 
the 
people” 
(—“realizing 
this, 
I 
necessarily 
became 
a 
complete 
revolutionary”). 


Let 
us 
remember 
that 
Wagner 
was 
young 
at 
the 
time 
Hegel 
and 
Schelling 
seduced 
men’s 
spirits; 
that 
he 
guessed, 
that 
he 
grasped 
with 
his 
very 
hands 



the 
only 
thing 
the 
Germans 
take 
seriously—“the 
idea,” 
which 
is 
to 
say, 
something 
that 
is 
obscure, 
uncertain, 
full 
of 
intimations; 
that 
among 
Germans 
clarity 
is 
an 
objection, 
logic 
a 
refutation. 
Harshly, 
Schopenhauer 
accused 
the 
epoch 
of 
Hegel 
and 
Schelling 
of 
dishonesty—harshly, 
also 
wrongly: 
he 
himself, 
the 
old 
pessimistic 
counterfeiter,1 
was 
not 
a 
whit 
more 
“honest” 
than 
his 
more 
famous 
contemporaries. 
Let 
us 
keep 
morals 
out 
of 
this: 
Hegel 
is 
a 
taste.— 
And 
not 
merely 
a 
German 
but 
a 
European 
taste.— 
A 
taste 
Wagner 
comprehended—to 
which 
he 
felt 
equal—which 
he 
immortalized.— 
He 
merely 
applied 
it 
to 
music—he 
invented 
a 
style 
for 
himself 
charged 
with 
“infinite 
meaning”—he 
became 
the 
heir 
of 
Hegel.— 
Music 
as 
“idea.”— 


And 
how 
Wagner 
was 
understood!— 
The 
same 
human 
type 
that 
raved 
about 
Hegel, 
today 
raves 
about 
Wagner; 
in 
his 
school 
they 
even 
write 
Hegelian.— 
Above 
all, 
German 
youths 
understood 
him. 
The 
two 
words 
“infinite” 
and 
“meaning” 
were 
really 
sufficient: 
they 
induced 
a 
state 
of 
incomparable 
well-being 
in 
young 
men. 
It 
was 
not 
with 
his 
music 
that 
Wagner 
conquered 
them, 
it 
was 
with 
the 
“idea”—it 
is 
the 
enigmatic 
character 
of 
his 
art, 
its 
playing 
hide-and-seek 
behind 
a 
hundred 
symbols, 
its 
polychromy 
of 
the 
ideal 
that 
leads 
and 
lures 
these 
youths 
to 
Wagner; 
it 
is 
Wagner’s 
genius 
for 
shaping 
clouds, 
his 
whirling, 
hurling, 
and 
twirling 
through 
the 
air, 
his 
everywhere 
and 
nowhere—the 
very 
same 
means 
by 
which 
Hegel 
formerly 
seduced 
and 
lured 
them! 


In 
the 
midst 
of 
Wagner’s 
multiplicity, 
abundance, 
and 
arbitrariness 
they 
feel 
as 
if 
justified 
in 
their 
own 
eyes—“redeemed.” 
Trembling, 
they 
hear 
how 
the 
great 
symbols 
approach 
from 
foggy 
distances 
to 
resound 
in 
his 
art 
with 
muted 
thunder; 
they 
are 
not 
impatient 
when 
at 
times 
things 
are 
gray, 
gruesome, 
and 
cold. 
After 
all, 
they 
are, 
without 
exception, 
like 
Wagner 
himself, 
related 
to 
such 
bad 
weather, 
German 
weather! 
Wotan 
is 
their 
god: 
but 
Wotan 
is 
the 
god 
of 
bad 
weather. 


They 
are 
quite 
right, 
these 
German 
youths, 
considering 
what 
they 
are 
like: 
how 
could 
they 
miss 
what 
we 
others, 
we 
halcyons, 
miss 
in 
Wagner—la 
gaya 
scienza;2 
light 
feet, 
wit, 
fire, 
grace; 
the 
great 
logic; 
the 
dance 
of 
the 
stars; 
the 
exuberant 
spirituality; 
the 
southern 
shivers 
of 
light; 
the 
smooth 
sea— 
perfection.— 



11 


I 
have 
explained 
where 
Wagner 
belongs—not 
in 
the 
history 
of 
music. 
What 
does 
he 
signify 
nevertheless 
in 
that 
history? 
The 
emergence 
of 
the 
actor 
in 
music: 
a 
capital 
event 
that 
invites 
thought, 
perhaps 
also 
fear. 
In 
a 
formula: 
“Wagner 
and 
Liszt.” 


Never 
yet 
has 
the 
integrity 
of 
musicians, 
their 
“authenticity,” 
been 
put 
to 
the 
test 
so 
dangerously. 
One 
can 
grasp 
it 
with 
one’s 
very 
hands: 
great 
success, 
success 
with 
the 
masses 
no 
longer 
sides 
with 
those 
who 
are 
authentic 
—one 
has 
to 
be 
an 
actor 
to 
achieve 
that. 


Victor 
Hugo 
and 
Richard 
Wagner—they 
signify 
the 
same 
thing: 
in 
declining 
cultures, 
wherever 
the 
decision 
comes 
to 
rest 
with 
the 
masses, 
authenticity 
becomes 
superfluous, 
disadvantageous, 
a 
liability. 
Only 
the 
actor 
still 
arouses 
great 
enthusiasm. 


Thus 
the 
golden 
age 
dawns 
for 
the 
actor—for 
him 
and 
for 
everything 
related 
to 
his 
kind. 
Wagner 
marches 
with 
drums 
and 
pipes 
at 
the 
head 
of 
all 
artists 
of 
delivery, 
of 
presentation, 
of 
virtuosity; 
the 
conductors, 
machinists, 
and 
stage 
singers 
were 
the 
first 
he 
convinced. 
Not 
to 
forget 
the 
orchestra 
musicians—these 
he 
“redeemed” 
from 
boredom. 


The 
movement 
Wagner 
created 
even 
reaches 
over 
into 
the 
field 
of 
knowledge: 
gradually, 
relevant 
sciences 
emerge 
from 
centuries 
of 
scholasticism. 
To 
give 
an 
example, 
I 
single 
out 
for 
special 
commendation 
the 
merits 
of 
Riemann1 
regarding 
rhythmics: 
he 
was 
the 
first 
to 
establish 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
central 
concept 
of 
punctuation 
for 
music, 
too 
(unfortunately, 
he 
used 
an 
ugly 
term, 
Phrasierung 
[phrasing]). 


All 
of 
these 
are, 
as 
I 
own 
gratefully, 
the 
best 
among 
Wagner’s 
admirers, 
those 
most 
deserving 
of 
our 
respect—they 
are 
simply 
right 
to 
admire 
Wagner. 
They 
share 
the 
same 
instinct, 
they 
recognize 
in 
him 
the 
highest 
representative 
of 
their 
type, 
they 
feel 
changed 
into 
a 
power, 
even 
a 
great 
power, 
ever 
since 
he 
kindled 
them 
with 
his 
own 
ardor. 
For 
here, 
if 
anywhere, 
Wagner’s 
influence 
has 
really 
been 
beneficial. 
Never 
yet 
has 
so 
much 
been 
thought, 
desired, 
and 
worked 
in 
this 
area. 
Wagner 
has 
given 
all 
of 
these 
artists 
a 
new 
conscience. 
What 
they 
now 
demand 
of 
themselves, 
get 
from 



themselves, 
they 
never 
demanded 
of 
themselves 
before 
Wagner 
came 
along 
—formerly, 
they 
were 
too 
modest. 
A 
new 
spirit 
prevails 
in 
the 
theater 
since 
Wagner’s 
spirit 
prevails 
there: 
one 
demands 
what 
is 
most 
difficult, 
one 
censures 
severely, 
one 
praises 
rarely—what 
is 
good, 
even 
excellent, 
is 
considered 
the 
rule. 
Taste 
is 
no 
longer 
required; 
not 
even 
a 
voice. 
Wagner 
is 
sung 
only 
with 
a 
ruined 
voice: 
the 
effect 
is 
“dramatic.” 
Even 
talent 
is 
precluded. 
Espressivo 
at 
any 
cost, 
as 
demanded 
by 
the 
Wagnerian 
ideal, 
the 
ideal 
of 
decadence, 
does 
not 
get 
along 
well 
with 
talent. 
It 
merely 
requires 
virtue—meaning 
training, 
automatism, 
“self-denial.” 
Neither 
taste, 
nor 
voice, 
nor 
talent: 
Wagner’s 
stage 
requires 
one 
thing 
only—Teutons!— 
Definition 
of 
the 
Teuton: 
obedience 
and 
long 
legs.— 


It 
is 
full 
of 
profound 
significance 
that 
the 
arrival 
of 
Wagner 
coincides 
in 
time 
with 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
“Reich”: 
both 
events 
prove 
the 
very 
same 
thing: 
obedience 
and 
long 
legs.— 
Never 
has 
obedience 
been 
better, 
never 
has 
commanding. 
Wagnerian 
conductors 
in 
particular 
are 
worthy 
of 
an 
age 
that 
posterity 
will 
call 
one 
day, 
with 
awed 
respect, 
the 
classical 
age 
of 
war. 
Wagner 
understood 
how 
to 
command; 
in 
this, 
too, 
he 
was 
the 
great 
teacher. 
He 
commanded 
as 
the 
inexorable 
will 
to 
himself, 
as 
lifelong 
self-discipline: 
Wagner 
who 
furnishes 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
example 
of 
self-violation 
in 
the 
history 
of 
art 
(—even 
Alfieri,2 
otherwise 
his 
closest 
relative, 
stands 
surpassed. 
Note 
by 
a 
Turinese).

The 
insight 
that 
our 
actors 
are 
more 
deserving 
of 
admiration 
than 
ever 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
they 
are 
any 
less 
dangerous.— 
But 
who 
could 
still 
doubt 
what 
I 
want—what 
are 
the 
three 
demands 
for 
which 
my 
wrath, 
my 
concern, 
my 
love 
of 
art 
has 
this 
time 
opened 
my 
mouth? 


That 
the 
theater 
should 
not 
lord 
it 
over 
the 
arts. 
That 
the 
actor 
should 
not 
seduce 
those 
who 
are 
authentic. 
That 
music 
should 
not 
become 
an 
art 
of 
lying.

[Nietzsche’s] 
Note. 
It 
has 
been 
a 
real 
misfortune 
for 
aesthetics 
that 
the 
word 
drama 
has 
always 
been 
translated 
“action” 
[Handlung]. 
It 
is 
not 
Wagner 
alone 
who 
errs 
at 
this 
point, 
the 
error 
is 
world-wide 
and 
extends 
even 
to 
the 
philologists 
who 
ought 
to 
know 
better. 
Ancient 
drama 
aimed 
at 
scenes 
of 
great 
pathos—it 
precluded 
action 
(moving 
it 
before 
the 
beginning 
or 
behind 
the 
scene). 
The 
word 
drama 
is 
of 
Doric 
origin, 
and 
according 
to 
Doric 
usage 
it 
means 
“event,” 
“story”—both 
words 
in 
the 
hieratic 
sense. 
The 
most 
ancient 
drama 
represented 
the 
legend 
of 
the 
place, 
the 
“holy 
story” 
on 
which 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
cult 
rested 
(not 
a 
doing 
but 
a 
happening:

actually 
does 
not 
mean

This 
is 
one 
of 
many 
passages 
in 
which 
Nietzsche 
uses 
this 
term 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
sense 
in 
which 
André 
Gide 
(1869–1951) 
later 
used 
it, 
in 
1926, 
as 
the 
title 
of 
his 
greatest 
novel: 
Les 
Faux-monnayeurs. 
Gide 
had 
earlier 
used 
another 
Nietzschean 
term 
in 
another 
book 
title: 
The 
Immoralist 
(1902).

These 
three 
words 
form 
the 
subtitle 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
book, 
Die 
Fröhliche 
Wissenschaft 
(the 
gay 
science; 
1882), 
translated 
into 
English 
under 
the 
title 
Joyful 
Wisdom. 
The 
concept 
of 
“gay 
science” 
goes 
back 
to 
the 
fourteenth 
century, 
when 
it 
was 
used 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
art 
of 
the 
troubadours.

Postscript 


The 
seriousness 
of 
the 
last 
words 
permits 
me 
to 
publish 
at 
this 
point 
a 
few 
sentences 
from 
an 
as 
yet 
unprinted 
essay. 
At 
least 
they 
should 
leave 
no 
room 
for 
doubt 
about 
my 
seriousness 
in 
this 
matter. 
This 
essay 
bears 
the 
title: 
The 
Price 
We 
Are 
Paying 
for 
Wagner. 


One 
pays 
heavily 
for 
being 
one 
of 
Wagner’s 
disciples. 
An 
obscure 
recognition 
of 
this 
fact 
is 
still 
encountered 
even 
today. 
Wagner’s 
success, 
his 
triumph, 
has 
not 
eradicated 
it. 
But 
formerly 
it 
was 
strong, 
it 
was 
terrible, 
it 
was 
like 
a 
dark 
hatred—through 
almost 
three 
quarters 
of 
Wagner’s 
life. 
The 
resistance 
he 
encountered 
among 
us 
Germans 
cannot 
be 
esteemed 
too 
highly 
or 
honored 
too 
much. 
He 
was 
resisted 
like 
a 
sickness—not 
with 
reasons—one 
does 
not 
refute 
a 
sickness—but 
with 
inhibition, 
mistrust, 
vexation, 
and 
disgust, 
with 
a 
gloomy 
seriousness, 
as 
if 
he 
represented 
some 
great 
creeping 
danger. 
Our 
honored 
aestheticians 
have 
compromised 
themselves 
when, 
coming 
from 
three 
schools 
of 
German 
philosophy, 
they 
waged 
an 
absurd 
war 
against 
Wagner’s 
principles 
with 
“if” 
and 
“for”—as 
if 
he 
cared 
about 
principles, 
even 
his 
own! 


The 
Germans 
themselves 
had 
reason 
enough 
in 
their 
instincts 
to 
rule 
out 
any 
“if” 
and 
“for.” 
An 
instinct 
is 
weakened 
when 
it 
rationalizes 
itself: 
for 
by 
rationalizing 
itself 
it 
weakens 
itself. 
If 
there 
are 
any 
signs 
that, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
total 
character 
of 
European 
decadence, 
the 
German 
character 
still 
possesses 
some 
degree 
of 
health, 
some 
instinctive 
sense 
for 
what 
is 
harmful 
and 
dangerous, 
this 
dim 
resistance 
to 
Wagner 
is 
the 
sign 
I 
should 
like 
least 
to 
see 
underestimated. 
It 
does 
us 
honor, 
it 
even 
permits 
a 
hope: 
France 
would 
not 
have 
that 
much 
health 
any 
more. 
The 
Germans, 
the 
delayers 
par 
excellence 
in 
history, 
are 
today 
the 
most 
retarded 
civilized 
nation 
in 
Europe:1 
this 
has 
its 
advantages—by 
the 
same 
token 
they 
are 
relatively 
the 
youngest. 


One 
pays 
heavily 
for 
being 
one 
of 
Wagner’s 
disciples. 
Only 
quite 
recently 
have 
the 
Germans 
shed 
a 
kind 
of 
fear 
of 
him—the 
itch 
to 
be 
rid 
of 
him 
they 
felt 
at 
every 
opportunity.* 



It 
is 
a 
curious 
matter, 
still 
remembered, 
which 
revealed 
this 
old 
feeling 
once 
more 
at 
the 
very 
end, 
quite 
unexpectedly. 
It 
happened 
at 
Wagner’s 
funeral: 
the 
first 
German 
Wagner 
Association, 
that 
of 
Munich, 
placed 
a 
wreath 
on 
his 
grave, 
with 
an 
inscription 
that 
immediately 
became 
famous. 
It 
read: 
“Redemption 
for 
the 
redeemer!” 
Everybody 
admired 
the 
lofty 
inspiration 
that 
had 
dictated 
this 
inscription; 
also 
the 
taste 
that 
distinguished 
Wagner’s 
admirers. 
But 
many 
(strangely 
enough!) 
made 
the 
same 
small 
correction: 
“Redemption 
from 
the 
redeemer!”— 
One 
heaved 
a 
sigh 
of 
relief. 
— 


One 
pays 
heavily 
for 
being 
one 
of 
Wagner’s 
disciples. 
Let 
us 
take 
the 
measure 
of 
this 
discipleship 
by 
considering 
its 
cultural 
effects. 
Whom 
did 
his 
movement 
bring 
to 
the 
fore? 
What 
did 
it 
breed 
and 
multiply?— 
Above 
all, 
the 
presumption 
of 
the 
layman, 
the 
art-idiot. 
That 
kind 
now 
organizes 
associations, 
wants 
its 
“taste” 
to 
prevail, 
wants 
to 
play 
the 
judge 
even 
in 
rebus 
musicis 
et 
musicantibus.2 
Secondly: 
an 
ever 
growing 
indifference 
against 
all 
severe, 
noble, 
conscientious 
training 
in 
the 
service 
of 
art; 
all 
this 
is 
to 
be 
replaced 
by 
faith 
in 
genius 
or, 
to 
speak 
plainly, 
by 
impudent 
dilettantism 
(—the 
formula 
for 
this 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
Meistersinger). 
Thirdly 
and 
worst 
of 
all: 
theatrocracy—the 
nonsense 
of 
a 
faith 
in 
the 
precedence 
of 
the 
theater, 
in 
the 
right 
of 
the 
theater 
to 
lord 
it 
over 
the 
arts, 
over 
art.— 


But 
one 
should 
tell 
the 
Wagnerians 
a 
hundred 
times 
to 
their 
faces 
what 
the 
theater 
is: 
always 
only 
beneath 
art, 
always 
only 
something 
secondary, 
something 
made 
cruder, 
something 
twisted 
tendentiously, 
mendaciously, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
masses. 
Wagner, 
too, 
did 
not 
change 
anything 
in 
this 
respect: 
Bayreuth 
is 
large-scale 
opera;—and 
not 
even 
good 
opera.— 
The 
theater 
is 
a 
form 
of 
demolatry3 
in 
matters 
of 
taste; 
the 
theater 
is 
a 
revolt 
of 
the 
masses,4 
a 
plebiscite 
against 
good 
taste.— 
This 
is 
precisely 
what 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
case 
of 
Wagner: 
he 
won 
the 
crowd, 
he 
corrupted 
taste, 
he 
spoiled 
even 
our 
taste 
for 
opera!—5 


One 
pays 
heavily 
for 
being 
one 
of 
Wagner’s 
disciples. 
What 
does 
it 
do 
to 
the 
spirit? 
Does 
Wagner 
liberate 
the 
spirit?— 
He 
is 
distinguished 
by 
every 
ambiguity, 
every 
double 
sense, 
everything 
quite 
generally 
that 
persuades 
those 
who 
are 
uncertain 
without 
making 
them 
aware 
of 
what 
they 
have 
been 
persuaded. 
Thus 
Wagner 
is 
a 
seducer 
on 
a 
large 
scale. 
There 
is 
nothing 
weary, 
nothing 
decrepit, 
nothing 
fatal 
and 
hostile 
to 
life 
in 
matters 
of 
the 
spirit 
that 
his 
art 
does 
not 
secretly 
safeguard: 
it 
is 
the 
blackest 
obscurantism 



that 
he 
conceals 
in 
the 
ideal’s 
shrouds 
of 
light. 
He 
flatters 
every 
nihilistic 
(Buddhistic) 
instinct 
and 
disguises 
it 
in 
music; 
he 
flatters 
everything 
Christian, 
every 
religious 
expression 
of 
decadence. 
Open 
your 
ears: 
everything 
that 
ever 
grew 
on 
the 
soil 
of 
impoverished 
life, 
all 
of 
the 
counterfeiting 
of 
transcendence 
and 
beyond,6 
has 
found 
its 
most 
sublime 
advocate 
in 
Wagner’s 
art—not 
by 
means 
of 
formulas: 
Wagner 
is 
too 
shrewd 
for 
formulas—but 
by 
means 
of 
a 
persuasion 
of 
sensuousness 
which 
in 
turn 
makes 
the 
spirit 
weary 
and 
worn-out. 
Music 
as 
Circe. 


His 
last 
work 
is 
in 
this 
respect 
his 
greatest 
masterpiece. 
In 
the 
art 
of 
seduction, 
Parsifal 
will 
always 
retain 
its 
rank—as 
the 
stroke 
of 
genius 
in 
seduction.— 
I 
admire 
this 
work; 
I 
wish 
I 
had 
written 
it 
myself; 
failing 
that, 
I 
understand 
it.— 
Wagner 
never 
had 
better 
inspirations 
than 
in 
the 
end. 
Here 
the 
cunning 
in 
his 
alliance 
of 
beauty 
and 
sickness 
goes 
so 
far 
that, 
as 
it 
were, 
it 
casts 
a 
shadow 
over 
Wagner’s 
earlier 
art—which 
now 
seems 
too 
bright, 
too 
healthy. 
Do 
you 
understand 
this? 
Health, 
brightness 
having 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
shadow? 
almost 
of 
an 
objection?— 
To 
such 
an 
extent 
have 
we 
become 
pure 
fools.— 
Never 
was 
there 
a 
greater 
master 
in 
dim, 
hieratic 
aromas—never 
was 
there 
a 
man 
equally 
expert 
in 
all 
small 
infinities, 
all 
that 
trembles 
and 
is 
effusive, 
all 
the 
feminisms 
from 
the 
idioticon7 
of 
happiness!— 
Drink, 
O 
my 
friends, 
the 
philters 
of 
this 
art! 
Nowhere 
will 
you 
find 
a 
more 
agreeable 
way 
of 
enervating 
your 
spirit, 
of 
forgetting 
your 
manhood 
under 
a 
rosebush.— 
Ah, 
this 
old 
magician! 
This 
Klingsor8 
of 
all 
Klingsors! 
How 
he 
thus 
wages 
war 
against 
us! 
us, 
the 
free 
spirits! 
How 
he 
indulges 
every 
cowardice 
of 
the 
modern 
soul 
with 
the 
tones 
of 
magic 
maidens!— 
Never 
before 
has 
there 
been 
such 
a 
deadly 
hatred 
of 
the 
search 
for 
knowledge!— 
One 
has 
to 
be 
a 
cynic 
in 
order 
not 
to 
be 
seduced 
here; 
one 
has 
to 
be 
able 
to 
bite 
in 
order 
not 
to 
worship 
here. 
Well 
then, 
you 
old 
seducer, 
the 
cynic 
warns 
you—cave 
canem.—9 


One 
pays 
heavily 
for 
being 
one 
of 
Wagner’s 
disciples. 
I 
observe 
those 
youths 
who 
have 
been 
exposed 
to 
his 
infection 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
The 
first, 
relatively 
innocent 
effect 
is 
the 
corruption 
of 
taste. 
Wagner 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
as 
continual 
consumption 
of 
alcohol: 
blunting, 
and 
obstructing 
the 
stomach 
with 
phlegm. 
Specific 
effect: 
degeneration 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
rhythm. 
In 
the 
end 
the 
Wagnerian 
calls 
rhythmic 
what 
I 
myself 
call, 
using 
a 
Greek 
proverb, 
“moving 
the 
swamps.” 
Considerably 
more 
dangerous 
is 
the 
corruption 
of 
concepts. 
The 
youth 
becomes 
a 
moon-calf—an 
“idealist.” 
He 
has 
gone 
beyond 
science; 
in 
this 
way 
he 
has 
reached 
the 
master’s 
level. 
And 
he 
poses 
as 
a 
philosopher; 
he 
writes 
Bayreuther 
Blätter;10 
he 
solves 
all 



problems 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
father, 
the 
son, 
and 
the 
holy 
master.11 
What 
is 
uncanniest, 
however, 
is 
the 
corruption 
of 
the 
nerves. 
Let 
anyone 
walk 
through 
a 
city: 
everywhere 
he 
will 
hear 
how 
instruments 
are 
ravished 
in 
a 
solemn 
rage—interspersed 
with 
a 
savage 
howling. 
What’s 
going 
on?— 
The 
youths 
are 
worshiping 
Wagner.— 
Bayreuth 
rhymes 
on 
institute 
for 
cold-
water 
therapy.12 


— 
Typical 
telegram 
from 
Bayreuth: 
bereits 
bereut 
[already 
rued].— 
Wagner 
is 
bad 
for 
youths; 
he 
is 
calamitous 
for 
women. 
What 
is 
a 
female 
Wagnerian, 
medically 
speaking?— 
It 
seems 
to 
me, 
a 
doctor 
can’t 
confront 
young 
women 
too 
seriously 
with 
this 
alternative 
for 
the 
conscience: 
one 
or 
the 
other.— 
But 
they 
have 
already 
made 
their 
choice. 
One 
cannot 
serve 
two 
masters 
when 
the 
name 
of 
one 
is 
Wagner. 
Wagner 
has 
redeemed 
woman; 
in 
return, 
woman 
has 
built 
Bayreuth 
for 
him. 
All 
sacrifice, 
all 
devotion: 
one 
has 
nothing 
that 
one 
would 
not 
give 
to 
him. 
Woman 
impoverishes 
herself 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
master, 
she 
becomes 
touching, 
she 
stands 
naked 
before 
him.— 
The 
female 
Wagnerian—the 
most 
charming 
ambiguity 
that 
exists 
today; 
she 
embodies 
the 
cause 
of 
Wagner—in 
her 
sign 
his 
cause 
triumphs.— 
Ah, 
this 
old 
robber! 
He 
robs 
our 
youths, 
he 
even 
robs 
our 
women 
and 
drags 
them 
into 
his 
den.— 
Ah, 
this 
old 
Minotaur! 
The 
price 
we 
have 
had 
to 
pay 
for 
him! 
Every 
year 
trains 
of 
the 
most 
beautiful 
maidens 
and 
youths 
are 
led 
into 
his 
labyrinth, 
so 
that 
he 
may 
devour 
them—every 
year 
all 
of 
Europe 
intones 
the 
words, 
“off 
to 
Crete! 
off 
to 
Crete!”13 



Second 
Postscript 


My 
letter, 
it 
seems, 
is 
open 
to 
a 
misunderstanding. 
On 
certain 
faces 
the 
lines 
of 
gratitude 
appear; 
I 
even 
hear 
a 
modest 
exultation. 
I 
should 
prefer 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
this 
matter—as 
in 
many 
others. 
— 
But 
since 
a 
new 
animal 
plays 
havoc 
in 
the 
vineyards 
of 
the 
German 
spirit, 
the 
Reich-worm, 
the 
famous 
Rhinoxera,1 
not 
a 
word 
I 
write 
is 
understood 
any 
more. 
Even 
the 


3

Kreuzzeitung2 
testifies 
to 
that, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
Literarische 
Zentralblatt. 


— 
I 
have 
given 
the 
Germans 
the 
most 
profound 
books 
they 
have—reason 
enough 
for 
the 
Germans 
not 
to 
understand 
a 
single 
word.— 
When 
in 
this 
essay 
I 
declare 
war 
upon 
Wagner—and 
incidentally 
upon 
a 
German 
“taste”—when 
I 
use 
harsh 
words 
against 
the 
cretinism 
of 
Bayreuth, 
the 
last 
thing 
I 
want 
to 
do 
is 
start 
a 
celebration 
for 
any 
other 
musicians. 
Other 
musicians 
don’t 
count 
compared 
to 
Wagner. 
Things 
are 
bad 
generally. 
Decay 
is 
universal. 
The 
sickness 
goes 
deep. 
If 
Wagner 
nevertheless 
gives 
his 
name 
to 
the 
ruin 
of 
music, 
as 
Bernini 
did 
to 
the 
ruin 
of 
sculpture, 
he 
is 
certainly 
not 
its 
cause. 
He 
merely 
accelerated 
its 
tempo—to 
be 
sure, 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
one 
stands 
horrified 
before 
this 
almost 
sudden 
downward 
motion, 
abyss-
ward. 
He 
had 
the 
naïveté 
of 
decadence: 
this 
was 
his 
superiority. 
He 
believed 
in 
it, 
he 
did 
not 
stop 
before 
any 
of 
the 
logical 
implications 
of 
decadence. 
The 
others 
hesitate—that 
is 
what 
differentiates 
them. 
Nothing 
else. 


What 
Wagner 
has 
in 
common 
with 
“the 
others”—I’ll 
enumerate 
it: 
the 
decline 
of 
the 
power 
to 
organize; 
the 
misuse 
of 
traditional 
means 
without 
the 
capacity 
to 
furnish 
any 
justification, 
any 
for-the-sake-of; 
the 
counterfeiting4 
in 
the 
imitation 
of 
big 
forms 
for 
which 
nobody 
today 
is 
strong, 
proud, 
self-
assured, 
healthy 
enough; 
excessive 
liveliness 
in 
the 
smallest 
parts; 
excitement 
at 
any 
price; 
cunning 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
impoverished 
life; 
more 
and 
more 
nerves 
in 
place 
of 
flesh.— 
I 
know 
only 
one 
musician 
who 
is 
still 
capable 
today 
of 
creating 
an 
overture 
that 
is 
of 
one 
piece: 
and 
nobody 
knows 
him.5 


Those 
famous 
today 
do 
not 
write 
“better” 
music 
than 
Wagner 
but 
merely 



less 
decisive 
music, 
more 
indifferent 
music—more 
indifferent 
because 
what 
is 
merely 
half 
is 
dated 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
what 
is 
whole. 
But 
Wagner 
was 
whole; 
but 
Wagner 
was 
the 
whole 
corruption; 
but 
Wagner 
was 
courage, 
the 
will, 
conviction 
in 
corruption—what 
does 
Johannes 
Brahms 
matter 
now?— 
His 
good 
fortune 
was 
a 
German 
misunderstanding: 
he 
was 
taken 
for 
Wagner’s 
antagonist—an 
antagonist 
was 
needed.— 
That 
does 
not 
make 
for 
necessary 
music, 
that 
makes, 
above 
all, 
for 
too 
much 
music.— 
If 
one 
is 
not 
rich 
one 
should 
have 
pride 
enough 
for 
poverty. 


The 
sympathy 
Brahms 
inspires 
undeniably 
at 
certain 
points, 
quite 
aside 
from 
this 
party 
interest, 
party 
misunderstanding, 
long 
seemed 
enigmatic 
to 
me—until 
finally 
I 
discovered, 
almost 
by 
accident, 
that 
he 
affects 
a 
certain 
type 
of 
man. 
His 
is 
the 
melancholy 
of 
incapacity; 
he 
does 
not 
create 
out 
of 
an 
abundance, 
he 
languishes 
for 
abundance. 
If 
we 
discount 
what 
he 
imitates, 
what 
he 
borrows 
from 
great 
old 
or 
exotic-modern 
styles—he 
is 
a 
master 
of 
imitation—what 
remains 
as 
specifically 
his 
is 
yearning.— 
This 
is 
felt 
by 
all 
who 
are 
full 
of 
yearning 
and 
dissatisfaction 
of 
any 
kind. 
He 
is 
too 
little 
a 
person, 
too 
little 
a 
center.— 
This 
is 
understood 
by 
those 
who 
are 
“impersonal,” 
those 
on 
the 
periphery—and 
they 
love 
him 
for 
that. 
In 
particular, 
he 
is 
the 
musician 
for 
a 
certain 
type 
of 
dissatisfied 
women. 
Fifty 
steps 
more, 
and 
you 
have 
got 
the 
female 
Wagnerian—just 
as 
fifty 
steps 
beyond 
Brahms 
you 
encounter 
Wagner—the 
female 
Wagnerian, 
a 
type 
that 
is 
more 
incisive, 
more 
interesting, 
and 
above 
all 
more 
charming. 
Brahms 
is 
touching 
as 
long 
as 
he 
is 
secretly 
enraptured 
or 
mourns 
for 
himself—in 
this 
he 
is 
“modern”; 
he 
becomes 
cold 
and 
of 
no 
further 
concern 
to 
us 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
becomes 
the 
heir 
of 
the 
classical 
composers.— 
People 
like 
to 
call 
Brahms 
the 
heir 
of 
Beethoven: 
I 
know 
no 
more 
cautious 
euphemism.— 


Everything 
in 
music 
today 
that 
lays 
claim 
to 
a 
“great 
style” 
either 
deceives 
us 
or 
deceives 
itself. 
This 
alternative 
gives 
enough 
food 
for 
thought; 
for 
it 
includes 
some 
casuistry 
about 
the 
value 
of 
these 
two 
cases. 
“Deceives 
us”: 
most 
people’s 
instinct 
protests 
against 
this—they 
don’t 
want 
to 
be 
deceived 
—but 
I 
myself 
should 
still 
prefer 
even 
this 
type 
to 
the 
other 
(“deceives 
itself). 
This 
is 
my 
taste.— 


To 
make 
this 
easier 
to 
understand, 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
“poor 
in 
spirit”: 
Brahms—or 
Wagner.— 
Brahms 
is 
no 
actor.— 
A 
goodly 
portion 
of 
the 
other 
musicians 
may 
be 
subsumed 
in 
the 
concept 
of 
Brahms.— 


I 
waste 
no 
words 
on 
the 
clever 
apes 
of 
Wagner, 
Goldmark, 
for 
example: 
with 
the 
Queen 
of 
Sheba6 
one 
belongs 
in 
a 
zoo—one 
can 
make 
an 
exhibit 
of 



oneself.— 
What 
can 
be 
done 
well 
today, 
what 
can 
be 
masterly, 
is 
only 
what 
is 
small. 
Here 
alone 
integrity 
is 
still 
possible.— 


Nothing, 
however, 
can 
cure 
music 
in 
what 
counts, 
from 
what 
counts, 
from 
the 
fatality 
of 
being 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
physiological 
contradiction—of 
being 
modern. 
The 
best 
instruction, 
the 
most 
conscientious 
training, 
intimacy 
on 
principle, 
even 
isolation 
in 
the 
company 
of 
the 
old 
masters—all 
this 
remains 
merely 
palliative—to 
speak 
more 
precisely, 
illusory—for 
one 
no 
longer 
has 
the 
presupposition 
in 
one’s 
body, 
whether 
this 
be 
the 
strong 
race 
of 
a 
Handel 
or 
whether 
it 
be 
the 
overflowing 
animal 
vitality 
of 
a 
Rossini.— 
Not 
everybody 
has 
a 
right 
to 
every 
teacher: 
that 
applies 
to 
whole 
ages.— 


To 
be 
sure, 
the 
possibility 
cannot 
be 
excluded 
that 
somewhere 
in 
Europe 
there 
are 
still 
remnants 
of 
stronger 
generations, 
of 
typically 
untimely 
human 
beings: 
if 
so, 
one 
could 
still 
hope 
for 
a 
belated 
beauty 
and 
perfection 
in 
music, 
too, 
from 
that 
quarter. 
What 
we 
can 
still 
experience 
at 
best 
are 
exceptions. 
From 
the 
rule 
that 
corruption 
is 
on 
top, 
that 
corruption 
is 
fatalistic, 
no 
god 
can 
save 
music.

* 
[Nietzsche’s] 
Note. 
Was 
Wagner 
a 
German 
at 
all? 
There 
are 
some 
reasons 
for 
this 
question. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
find 
any 
German 
trait 
in 
him. 
Being 
a 
great 
learner, 
he 
learned 
to 
imitate 
much 
that 
was 
German— 
that’s 
all. 
His 
own 
nature 
contradicts 
that 
which 
has 
hitherto 
been 
felt 
to 
be 
German—not 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
German 
musician.— 
His 
father 
was 
an 
actor 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Geyer. 
A 
Geyer 
[vulture] 
is 
practically 
an 
Adler 
[eagle].— 
What 
has 
hitherto 
circulated 
as 
“Wagner’s 
Life” 
is 
fable 
convenue 
[a 
myth 
that 
has 
gained 
acceptance], 
if 
not 
worse. 
I 
confess 
my 
mistrust 
of 
every 
point 
attested 
to 
only 
by 
Wagner 
himself. 
He 
did 
not 
have 
pride 
enough 
for 
any 
truth 
about 
himself; 
nobody 
was 
less 
proud. 
Entirely 
like 
Victor 
Hugo, 
he 
remained 
faithful 
to 
himself 
in 
biographical 
questions, 
too—he 
remained 
an 
actor.

Ein

introduced

Ortega 
y 
Gasset 
(1883–1955) 
gave 
it 
world-wide 
currency 
when 
he 
made 
it 
the 
title 
of 
his 
best 
known 
book 
in 
1930. 
Nietzsche’s 
influence 
on 
Oretga

very 
great.

“Verderben” 
can 
mean 
“spoil” 
as 
well 
as 
“corrupt.” 
If 
verdarb 
were 
taken 
to 
mean 
“corrupted” 
in 
both 
places, 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
sentence 
would 
be 
puzzling: 
“he 
corrupted 
our 
taste 
even 
for 
opera.” 
Why 
“even 
for 
opera”? 
One 
would 
expect 
Nietzsche 
to 
say 
that 
Wagner 
corrupted 
not 
only 
musical 
taste, 
and 
taste 
for 
opera 
above 
all, 
but 
also 
taste 
in 
general. 
So 
Nietzsche 
presumably 
means: 
he 
corrupted 
taste 
and 
spoiled 
even 
our 
taste 
for 
opera.

The

the

that

Greek 
rhinos, 
which

either

be 
the

does 
not 
seem 
relevant.

Phylloxera,

and 
I 
have 
found 
that 
in

there 
actually 
was 
an 
international 
convention 
about 
means 
to 



combat 
this 
vine 
pest. 
Nietzsche’s 
Rhinoxera 
might 
thus 
be 
translated 
Rhinepest. 
The 
Rhine 
is 
a 
symbol

German 
nationalism

central 
in 
Wagner’s

this 
should 
be 
taken 
too 
seriously, 
any 
more 
than 
similar 
coinages 
in 
Zarathustra. 
But 
it 
helps 
to 
explain 
why 
Christian 
Morgenstern 
(1871–1914) 
placed

Epilogue 


Let 
us 
recover 
our 
breath 
in 
the 
end 
by 
getting 
away 
for 
a 
moment 
from 
the 
narrow 
world 
to 
which 
every 
question 
about 
the 
worth 
of 
persons 
condemns 
the 
spirit. 
A 
philosopher 
feels 
the 
need 
to 
wash 
his 
hands 
after 
having 
dealt 
so 
long 
with 
“The 
Case 
of 
Wagner.”— 


I 
offer 
my 
conception 
of 
what 
is 
modern.— 
In 
its 
measure 
of 
strength 
every 
age 
also 
possesses 
a 
measure 
for 
what 
virtues 
are 
permitted 
and 
forbidden 
to 
it. 
Either 
it 
has 
the 
virtues 
of 
ascending 
life: 
then 
it 
will 
resist 
from 
the 
profoundest 
depths 
the 
virtues 
of 
declining 
life. 
Or 
the 
age 
itself 
represents 
declining 
life: 
then 
it 
also 
requires 
the 
virtues 
of 
decline, 
then 
it 
hates 
everything 
that 
justifies 
itself 
solely 
out 
of 
abundance, 
out 
of 
the 
overflowing 
riches 
of 
strength. 
Aesthetics 
is 
tied 
indissolubly 
to 
these 
biological 
presuppositions: 
there 
is 
an 
aesthetics 
of 
decadence, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
classical 
aesthetics—the 
“beautiful 
in 
itself”1 
is 
a 
figment 
of 
the 
imagination, 
like 
all 
of 
idealism.— 


In 
the 
narrower 
sphere 
of 
so-called 
moral 
values 
one 
cannot 
find 
a 
greater 
contrast 
than 
that 
between 
a 
master 
morality2 
and 
the 
morality 
of 
Christian 
value 
concepts: 
the 
latter 
developed 
on 
soil 
that 
was 
morbid 
through 
and 
through 
(the 
Gospels 
present 
us 
with 
precisely 
the 
same 
physiological 
types 
that 
Dostoevsky’s 
novels 
describe),3 
master 
morality 
(“Roman,” 
“pagan,” 
“classical,” 
“Renaissance”) 
is, 
conversely, 
the 
sign 
language 
of 
what 
has 
turned 
out 
well, 
of 
ascending 
life, 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power 
as 
the 
principle 
of 
life. 
Master 
morality 
affirms 
as 
instinctively 
as 
Christian 
morality 
negates 
(“God,” 
“beyond,” 
“self-denial”—all 
of 
them 
negations). 
The 
former 
gives 
to 
things 
out 
of 
its 
own 
abundance—it 
transfigures, 
it 
beautifies 
the 
world 
and 
makes 
it 
more 
rational—the 
latter 
impoverishes, 
pales 
and 
makes 
uglier 
the 
value 
of 
things, 
it 
negates 
the 
world. 
“World” 
is 
a 
Christian 
term 
of 
abuse.— 


These 
opposite 
forms 
in 
the 
optics 
of 
value 
are 
both 
necessary: 
they 
are 
ways 
of 
seeing, 
immune 
to 
reasons 
and 
refutations. 
One 
cannot 
refute 
Christianity; 
one 
cannot 
refute 
a 
disease 
of 
the 
eye. 
That 
pessimism 
was 



fought 
like 
a 
philosophy, 
was 
the 
height 
of 
scholarly 
idiocy. 
The 
concepts 
“true” 
and 
“untrue” 
have, 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
no 
meaning 
in 
optics.— 


What 
alone 
should 
be 
resisted 
is 
that 
falseness, 
that 
deceitfulness 
of 
instinct 
which 
refuses 
to 
experience 
these 
opposites 
as 
opposites—as 
Wagner, 
for 
example, 
refused, 
being 
no 
mean 
master 
of 
such 
falsehoods. 
To 
make 
eyes 
at 
master 
morality, 
at 
noble 
morality 
(Icelandic 
saga 
is 
almost 
its 
most 
important 
document) 
while 
mouthing 
the 
counterdoctrine, 
that 
of 
the 
“gospel 
of 
the 
lowly,” 
of 
the 
need 
for 
redemption!— 


I 
admire, 
incidentally, 
the 
modesty 
of 
the 
Christians 
who 
go 
to 
Bayreuth. 
I 
myself 
wouldn’t 
be 
able 
to 
endure 
certain 
words 
out 
of 
the 
mouth 
of 
a 
Wagner. 
There 
are 
concepts 
which 
do 
not 
belong 
in 
Bayreuth.— 


What? 
A 
version 
of 
Christianity 
adapted 
for 
female 
Wagnerians, 
perhaps 
by 
female 
Wagnerians—for 
Wagner 
was 
in 
his 
old 
days 
by 
all 
means 
feminini 
generis? 
To 
say 
it 
once 
more, 
the 
Christians 
of 
today 
are 
too 
modest 
for 
my 
taste.— 


If 
Wagner 
was 
a 
Christian, 
then 
Liszt 
was 
perhaps 
a 
church 
father!4 


— 
The 
need 
for 
redemption, 
the 
quintessence 
of 
all 
Christian 
needs, 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
such 
buffoons: 
it 
is 
the 
most 
honest 
expression 
of 
decadence, 
it 
is 
the 
most 
convinced, 
most 
painful 
affirmation 
of 
decadence 
in 
the 
form 
of 
sublime 
symbols 
and 
practices. 
The 
Christian 
wants 
to 
be 
rid 
of 
himself. 
Le 
moi 
est 
toujours 
haïssable.5 
Noble 
morality, 
master 
morality, 
conversely, 
is 
rooted 
in 
a 
triumphant 
Yes 
said 
to 
oneself—it 
is 
self-affirmation, 
self-glorification 
of 
life; 
it 
also 
requires 
sublime 
symbols 
and 
practices, 
but 
only 
because 
“its 
heart 
is 
too 
full.” 
All 
of 
beautiful, 
all 
of 
great 
art 
belongs 
here: 
the 
essence 
of 
both 
is 
gratitude. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
cannot 
dissociate 
from 
it 
an 
instinctive 
aversion 
against 
decadents, 
scorn 
for 
their 
symbolism, 
even 
horror: 
such 
feelings 
almost 
prove 
it. 
Noble 
Romans 
experienced 
Christianity 
as 
foeda 
superstitio:6 
I 
recall 
how 
the 
last 
German 
of 
noble 
taste, 
how 
Goethe 
experienced 
the 
cross.7 


One 
looks 
in 
vain 
for 
more 
valuable, 
more 
necessary 
opposites.—* 


But 
such 
falseness 
as 
that 
of 
Bayreuth 
is 
no 
exception 
today. 
We 
are 
all 
familiar 
with 
the 
unaesthetic 
concept 
of 
the 
Christian 
Junker. 
Such 
innocence 
among 
opposites, 
such 
a 
“good 
conscience” 
in 
a 
lie 
is 
actually 
modern 
par 
excellence, 
it 
almost 
defines 
modernity. 
Biologically, 
modern 
man 
represents 
a 
contradiction 
of 
values; 
he 
sits 
between 
two 
chairs, 
he 
says 
Yes 
and 
No 
in 
the 
same 
breath. 
Is 
it 
any 
wonder 
that 
precisely 
in 
our 
times 
falsehood 
itself 
has 
become 
flesh 
and 
even 
genius? 
that 
Wagner 
“dwelled 
among 
us”? 
It 
was 



not 
without 
reason 
that 
I 
called 
Wagner 
the 
Cagliostro 
of 
modernity.— 


But 
all 
of 
us 
have, 
unconsciously, 
involuntarily 
in 
our 
bodies 
values, 
words, 
formulas, 
moralities 
of 
opposite 
descent—we 
are, 
physiologically 
considered, 
false.— 
A 
diagnosis 
of 
the 
modern 
soul—where 
would 
it 
begin? 
With 
a 
resolute 
incision 
into 
this 
instinctive 
contradiction, 
with 
the 
isolation 
of 
its 
opposite 
values, 
with 
the 
vivisection 
of 
the 
most 
instructive 
case.— 
The 
case 
of 
Wagner 
is 
for 
the 
philosopher 
a 
windfall—this 
essay 
is 
inspired, 
as 
you 
hear, 
by 
gratitude.—

… 
Dear 
friend, 
do 
you 
recall 
that 
in 
Turin 
I 
wrote 
a 
little 
pamphlet? 
Now 
we 
are 
printing 
it; 
and 
you 
are 
requested 
most 
urgently 
to 
help. 
Naumann2 
already 
has 
your 
address. 
The 
title 
is: 


The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 


A 
Musicians’ 
Problem 


By 


FRIEDRICH 
NIETZSCHE. 


It 
is 
something 
amusing 
with 
a 
fond 
of 
almost 
too 
much 
seriousness.— 
Could 
you 
get 
hold 
of 
Wagner’s 
coll. 
writings? 
I’d 
like 
to 
have 
a 
few 
references, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
quote 
exactly, 
with 
the 
numbers 
of 
volumes 
and 
pages. 
(1) 
In 
the 
text 
of 
the 
Ring 
there 
is 
a 
variant 
of 
Brünnhilde’s 
last 
aria 
that 
is 
entirely 
Buddhistic: 
I 
only 
need 
the 
numbers 
of 
volume 
and 
page, 
not 
the 
words. 
(2) 
How 
does 
this 
passage 
in 
Tristan 
go 
literally: 


The 
awful 
deep 
mysterious 
ground, 
Who 
will 
proclaim 
it 
to 
the 
world? 


Is 
this 
right? 


3) 
In 
one 
of 
his 
last 
writings 
Wagner 
once 
said—in 
italics 
if 
I 
remember 
it 
right—that 
“chastity 
works 
miracles.” 
Here 
I’d 
like 
the 
exact 
wording. 
For 
the 
rest 
I 
ask 
you 
to 
offer 
every 
kind 
of 
objection, 
of 
criticism 
of 
wording 
and 
taste. 
There 
are 
many 
bold 
things 
in 
this 
little 
fabrication.— 
Procedure 
with 
printer’s 
proofs 
as 
usual. 
About 
appearance, 
paper, 
etc., 
Naumann 
and 
I 
have 
already 
reached 
agreement. 
The 
manuscript 
will 
be 
in 
his 
hands 
July 
19.…

In 
the 
score, 
which 
arrived 
recently 
from 
Venice, 
Marke’s3 
question 
is: 


The 
unfathomably 
deep 
mysterious 
ground,

The 
text 
in

if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
is 


The 
unfathomable

It 
was 
some 
such 
entirely 
insane 
piling

Dear 
Friend, 


In 
the 
first 
lines 
of 
the 
Preface 
I 
had 
changed 
the 
words 
“many 
jokes” 
to 
read 
“a 
hundred 
jokes.” 
Looking 
back, 
the 
word 
“hundred” 
here 
seems 
to 
me 
too 
strong; 
I 
suggest 
that 
in 
your 
revision 
you 
restore 
the 
original 
“many.”

incredibly 
beautiful 
day,

There 
are 
still 
postscripts 
to 
my

of 
which

must 
be 
read; 
I 
am 
sorry. 
A 
lot 
of 
pepper

salt; 
in 
the 
second 
postscript 
I 
take 
the 
problem 
by 
the 
horns 
in 
amplified

(I 
shan’t 
easily 
find 
another 
opportunity 
to 
speak

these 
matters 
again; 
the

chosen

allows 
me 
many

Among 
other 
things, 
a

At 
one

I 
even 
permitted 
myself

you—in

will 
have 
your

The 
strongest 
passages 
are 
really 
in 
the 
“postscripts”; 
at 
one 
point 
I 
even 
have 
doubts 
whether 
I 
have 
not 
gone 
too 
far 
(not 
in 
the 
facts 
but 
in 
speaking 
of 
the 
facts). 
Perhaps 
we 
better 
omit 
the 
note4 
(in 
which 
something 
is 
suggested 
about 
Wagner’s 
descent) 
and 
instead 
leave 
larger 
spaces 
between 
the 
major 
subdivisions 
of 
the 
“postscript.”

redeemer” 
(p. 
42,

the 
final 
words

Wagner’s 
Parsifal. 
Whether 
the 
Wagner 
Association 
in 
Munich 
was 
the 
first 
in 
Germany 
I 
have 
not 
been 
able 
to

I 
have

you

12,7 
you 
might 
change 
to

you

rhymes 
on

cold-water 
therapy”

up

return 
with 
great 
force

Wagner’s 
falseness:

every 
hint

this 
direction

valuable.

have 
reworked 
several

24,

Dear 
friend, 
I 
am 
just 
mailing 
the 
epilogue 
to 
Naumann 
with 
the 
request 
that 
it 
be 
sent 
to 
you 
once 
more 
for 
a 
final 
revision. 
It 
seemed 
useful 
to 
me 
to 
say 
a 
few 
things 
more 
clearly 
(it 
seemed 
a 
finesse 
to 
shield 
Christianity 
against 
Wagner). 
Also, 
the 
very 
last 
sentence 
is 
stronger 
now—also 
more 
cheerful. 


“Off 
to 
Crete!” 
is 
a 
famous 
chorus 
in 
La 
Belle 
Hélène.12 
This 
I 
am 
telling 
you 
from 
malice 
because 
you 
“instructed” 
me 
about 
the 
final 
words 
of 
Parsifal. 
These 
“last 
words” 
of 
Wagner 
had 
after 
all 
been 
my 
leitmotif.…

I 
did 
not 
know 
that 
“Off 
to 
Crete!” 
comes 
from 
La 
Belle 
Hélène. 
When 
I 
took 
the 
liberty 
of 
indicating 
the 
source

the 
words 
“Redemption

FROM 
NIETZSCHE’S 
LETTER 
TO 
OVERBECK, 
October 
18, 
1888 


It 
is 
surprising 
how 
easily 
one 
can 
learn 
from 
this 
essay 
about 
the 
degree 
of 
my 
heterodoxy 
which 
actually 
does 
not 
leave 
a 
single 
stone 
standing 
on 
another. 
Against 
the 
Germans 
I 
here 
advance 
on 
all 
fronts: 
you’ll 
have 
no 
occasion 
for 
complaints 
about 
“ambiguity.” 
This 
utterly 
irresponsible 
race 
which 
has 
on 
its 
conscience 
all 
the 
great 
disasters 
of 
civilization 
and 
at 
all 
decisive 
moments 
of 
history 
had 
something 
“else” 
on 
its 
mind 
(the 
Reformation 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Renaissance; 
Kantian 
philosophy 
precisely 
when 
a 
scientific 
way 
of 
thinking 
had 
just 
been 
attained 
with 
some 
trouble 
in 
England 
and 
France; 
“Wars 
of 
Liberation” 
when 
Napoleon 
appeared, 
the 
only 
man 
so 
far 
who 
was 
strong 
enough 
to 
turn 
Europe 
into 
a 
political 
and 
economic 
unit), 
now 
has 
“the 
Reich” 
on 
its 
mind—this 
recrudescence 
of 
petty 
state 
politics 
and 
cultural 
atomism—at 
a 
moment 
when 
the 
great 
question 
of 
values 
is 
posed 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
There 
has 
never 
been 
a 
more 
important 
moment 
in 
history: 
but 
who 
might 
be 
aware 
of 
that?

Ecce 
Homo 
is 
one 
of 
the 
treasures 
of 
world 
literature. 
Written 
in 
1888 
and 
first 
published 
in 
1908, 
it 
has 
been 
largely 
ignored 
or 
misunderstood. 
Yet 
it 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
interpretation 
of 
his 
development, 
his 
works, 
and 
his 
significance; 
and 
we 
should 
gladly 
trade 
the 
whole 
vast 
literature 
on 
Nietzsche 
for 
this 
one 
small 
book. 
Who 
would 
not 
rather 
have 
Shakespeare 
on 
Shakespeare, 
including 
the 
poet’s 
own 
reflections 
on 
his 
plays 
and 
poems, 
than 
the 
exegeses 
and 
conjectures 
of 
thousands 
of 
critics 
and 
professors? 


Socrates 
said 
in 
the 
Apology 
that 
the 
poets 
are 
among 
the 
worst 
interpreters 
of 
their 
own 
works: 
they 
create 
without 
understanding, 
on 
the 
wings 
of 
inspiration; 
but 
when 
they 
discuss 
their 
works 
they 
rely 
on 
their 
uninspired 
reason 
and 
falter. 
But 
Ecce 
Homo 
is 
clearly 
not 
the 
work 
of 
a 
pedant 
whose 
genius 
has 
quit 
him. 
It 
is 
itself 
a 
work 
of 
art 
and 
marks 
one 
of 
the 
high 
points 
of 
German 
prose. 


There 
are 
those 
who 
like 
Nietzsche’s 
early 
works 
best—especially 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
and 
the 
“untimely” 
meditation 
on 
historiography; 
but 
they 
are 
few 
by 
now 
and 
no 
longer 
a 
force 
to 
reckon 
with. 
Others 
have 
always 
preferred 
the 
aphoristic 
works 
in 
which 
Nietzsche 
emerged 
as 
Germany’s 
greatest 
master 
of 
prose. 
By 
far 
the 
larger 
number 
of 
his 
readers 
have 
most 
admired 
Zarathustra. 
And 
the 
rest, 
including 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
Anglo-
American 
philosophers 
who 
take 
him 
seriously 
at 
all, 
have 
little 
doubt 
that 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil 
and 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals 
are 
his 
finest 
books. 
I 
am 
assuredly 
in 
a 
minority—perhaps 
of 
one—when 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
love 
best 
the 
five 
books 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
during 
his 
last 
productive 
year, 
1888—not 
least 
because 
they 
are 
such 
brilliant 
works 
of 
art. 


The 
Case 
of 
Wagner, 
The 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols, 
The 
Antichrist, 
and 
Ecce 
Homo 
present 
a 
crescendo 
without 
equal 
in 
prose. 
Then 
comes 
the 
final 
work, 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner, 
Nietzsche’s 
briefest 
and 
most 
beautiful 
book—a 
selection 
of 
passages 
from 
his 
earlier 
works, 
admittedly 
very 
slightly 
revised 
and 
improved 
in 
a 
few 
places—an 
attempt 
to 
approximate 
perfection. 
The 
preface 
to 
that 
book 
was 
dated 
Christmas 
1888. 
A 
few 
days 
later, 
during 
the 
first 
week 
of 
January, 
he 
collapsed 
on 
the 
street, 
recovered 
sufficient 
lucidity 



to 
dispatch 
a 
few 
mad 
but 
strangely 
beautiful 
letters1 
—and 
then 
darkness 
closed 
in 
and 
extinguished 
passion 
and 
intelligence. 
He 
suffered 
and 
thought 
no 
more. 
He 
had 
burnt 
himself 
out. 


Was 
the 
vegetating 
body 
that 
survived 
another 
decade 
and 
more, 
until 
August 
1900, 
still 
the 
poet 
and 
philosopher, 
artist 
and 
Antichrist? 
Socrates 
gently 
ridiculed 
disciples 
who 
thought 
that 
the 
body 
that 
remained 
after 
his 
death 
would 
still 
be 
Socrates. 
But 
reproductions 
of 
portraits 
of 
Nietzsche 
in 
the 
eighteen-nineties, 
commissioned 
by 
his 
sister 
who 
let 
his 
mustache 
grow 
as 
he 
himself 
never 
had, 
who 
clad 
him 
in 
white 
robes 
and 
fancied 
his 
vacant 
stare—portraits 
that 
show 
no 
glimpse 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
vanished 
spirit—these 
appear 
with 
his 
books 
to 
this 
day. 


Of 
Nietzsche’s 
last 
works, 
none 
has 
proved 
harder 
to 
understand 
than 
Ecce 
Homo. 
The 
self-portrait 
is 
not 
naturalistic; 
hence, 
it 
was 
widely 
felt, 
it 
is 
clearly 
insane 
and 
to 
be 
disregarded. 
This 
prevalent 
view 
is 
doubly 
false. 
The 
lack 
of 
naturalism 
is 
not 
proof 
of 
insanity 
but 
a 
triumph 
of 
style—of 
a 
piece 
with 
the 
best 
paintings 
of 
that 
time. 
And 
even 
if 
what 
might 
be 
interpreted 
as 
signs 
of 
madness 
do 
occasionally 
flicker 
in 
a 
passage, 
that 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
portrait 
can 
therefore 
be 
ignored. 
In 
both 
respects 
Nietzsche 
should 
be 
compared 
with 
Van 
Gogh. 


Ecce 
Homo 
does 
not 
fit 
any 
ordinary 
conception 
of 
philosophers. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
remote 
from 
the 
world 
of 
professorial 
or 
donnish 
philosophy, 
from 
tomes 
and 
articles, 
footnotes 
and 
jargon—in 
brief, 
from 
the 
modern 
image. 
It 
is 
equally 
far 
from 
the 
popular 
notion 
of 
the 
wise 
man: 
serene, 
past 
passion, 
temperate, 
and 
Apollinian. 
But 
this 
is 
plainly 
part 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
point: 
to 
offer 
a 
new 
image—a 
philosopher 
who 
is 
not 
an 
Alexandrian 
academician, 
nor 
an 
Apollinian 
sage, 
but 
Dionysian. 


While 
Van 
Gogh, 
having 
fled 
his 
native 
north, 
burnt 
himself 
out 
in 
southern 
France, 
creating 
an 
incredible 
number 
of 
works 
without 
any 
public 
recognition, 
fighting 
time 
till 
1890, 
when 
madness 
could 
no 
longer 
be 
held 
off 
and 
he 
shot 
himself, 
Nietzsche 
spent 
himself 
with 
comparable 
passion 
just 
a 
few 
miles 
further 
east, 
writing 
feverishly—not 
even 
pausing, 
as 
in 
keeping 
with 
his 
own 
ideas 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
done, 
to 
take 
his 
life 
before 
his 
spirit 
quit 
it. 
Freud 
used 
to 
say 
of 
him 
that 
“he 
had 
a 
more 
penetrating 
knowledge 
of 
himself 
than 
any 
other 
man 
who 
ever 
lived 
or 
was 
ever 
likely 
to 
live”2 
yet 
Nietzsche 
was 
not 
aware 
of 
his 
impending 
madness 
and 
therefore, 
unable 
to 
forestall 
it. 


In 
his 
first 
book 
Nietzsche 
had 
traced 
the 
“birth 
of 
tragedy” 
to 
the 
creative 



fusion 
of 
the 
Apollinian 
and 
the 
Dionysian, 
and 
the 
death 
of 
tragedy 
to 
the 
imperious 
rationalism 
for 
which 
he 
found 
the 
most 
impressive 
symbol 
in 
Socrates. 
Then 
he 
had 
found 
a 
rebirth 
of 
tragedy 
in 
Wagner’s 
work 
and 
had 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
advent 
of 
an 
“artistic 
Socrates”—Nietzsche 
himself. 
The 
critical 
passion, 
the 
revolt 
against 
hallowed 
pieties, 
the 
demand 
for 
clarity, 
and 
the 
fusion 
of 
life 
and 
thought 
need 
not 
always 
remain 
opposed 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
art 
and 
need 
not 
inspire 
such 
confidence 
in 
the 
unaided 
reason 
that 
one’s 
heir 
would 
proceed 
to 
proscribe 
all 
tragedy, 
as 
Plato 
did; 
rather, 
all 
this 
might 
be 
merged 
with 
a 
vision 
of 
the 
world 
that 
would 
be 
closer 
to 
Sophocles, 
and 
with 
a 
poetic 
temperament 
partaking 
more 
of 
Pindar 
than 
of 
Plato, 
more 
of 
Dionysus 
than 
Apollo. 
Ecce 
Homo 
is 
the 
Apology 
of 
this 
“artistic 
Socrates:” 


Plato’s 
Socrates 
had 
claimed 
in 
his 
Apology 
that 
he 
was 
the 
wisest 
of 
men, 
not 
because 
he 
was 
so 
wise 
but 
because 
his 
fellow 
men 
were 
so 
stupid, 
especially 
those 
who 
were 
considered 
the 
wisest—for 
they 
thought 
they 
knew 
what 
in 
fact 
they 
did 
not 
know. 
And 
Socrates, 
accused 
of 
impiety 
and 
corrupting 
the 
youth 
of 
Athens, 
argued 
that 
he 
was 
actually 
the 
city’s 
greatest 
benefactor 
and 
deserving 
of 
the 
highest 
honors. 
Thus, 
Ecce 
Homo 
could 
have 
been 
entitled 
“Variations 
on 
a 
Theme 
by 
Socrates.” 
That 
would 
have 
been 
an 
artistic 
title, 
but 
out 
of 
the 
question 
for 
a 
writer 
who 
had 
just 
finished 
The 
Antichrist. 
Ecce 
Homo—the 
words 
Pilate 
had, 
according 
to 
John 
(19:5), 
spoken 
of 
Jesus: 
“Behold 
the 
man!”—seemed 
more 
to 
the 
point. 
But 
that 
point 
was 
not 
to 
suggest 
any 
close 
similarity 
between 
himself 
and 
Jesus; 
more 
nearly 
the 
opposite. 
Here 
is 
a 
man! 
Here 
is 
a 
new, 
a 
different 
image 
of 
humanity: 
not 
a 
saint 
or 
holy 
man 
any 
more 
than 
a 
traditional 
sage, 
but 
a 
modern 
version. 


In 
the 
text 
Nietzsche 
said 
he 
wished 
to 
prevent 
any 
mischievous 
use 
of 
himself—dass 
man 
Unfug 
mit 
mir 
treibt. 
Our 
knowledge 
that 
two 
months 
after 
finishing 
the 
first 
draft 
of 
the 
book, 
and 
less 
than 
four 
weeks 
after 
he 
had 
gone 
over 
the 
whole 
work 
once 
more, 
he 
became 
insane 
gives 
the 
book 
a 
tragic 
dimension 
that 
is 
heightened 
almost 
intolerably 
if 
we 
bear 
in 
mind 
how 
he 
failed 
to 
prevent 
the 
mischief 
he 
feared. 
The 
first 
section 
of 
the 
Preface 
ends: 
“Above 
all, 
do 
not 
mistake 
me 
for 
someone 
else!” 
He 
underlined 
this 
cry—but 
soon 
his 
sister 
imposed 
her 
exceedingly 
unsubtle 
notion 
of 
hero 
and 
prophet 
on 
a 
mindless 
invalid—and 
in 
her 
sign 
he 
triumphed. 


That 
was 
but 
the 
beginning. 
Far 
worse 
mischief 
followed. 
Nietzsche’s 
voice 
was 
drowned 
out 
as 
misinterpretations 
that 
he 
had 
explicitly 
repudiated 



with 
much 
wit 
and 
malice 
were 
accepted 
and 
repeated, 
and 
repeated 
and 
accepted, 
until 
most 
readers 
knew 
what 
to 
expect 
before 
they 
read 
Nietzsche, 
and 
so 
read 
nothing 
but 
what 
they 
had 
long 
expected. 



2 


What 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
comments 
on 
his 
own 
works? 
Can 
his 
interpretations 
really 
be 
taken 
seriously? 


The 
very 
question 
smacks 
of 
an 
obscene 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values, 
through 
which, 
soon 
after 
the 
book 
was 
written, 
everything 
was 
turned 
upside 
down. 
Nietzsche’s 
sister 
had 
mocked 
her 
brother’s 
claims 
to 
fame, 
but 
then, 
switching 
to 
his 
cause 
after 
her 
husband’s 
suicide, 
she 
took 
private 
lessons 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
philosophy 
from 
Rudolf 
Steiner, 
a 
Goethe 
scholar 
who 
later 
became 
famous 
as 
the 
founder 
of 
anthroposophy. 
Soon 
Steiner 
gave 
her 
up 
as 
simply 
incapable 
of 
understanding 
Nietzsche. 
Meanwhile 
she 
became 
her 
brother’s 
official 
exegete 
and 
biographer, 
tampered 
with 
his 
letters—and 
was 
taken 
seriously 
by 
almost 
everyone. 
And 
who 
was 
not 
taken 
seriously? 
Even 
the 
most 
unscrupulous 
Nazi 
interpretations 
were 
taken 
seriously 
not 
only 
inside 
Germany, 
but 
by 
a 
host 
of 
foreign 
scholars 
who 
did 
not 
bother 
to 
check 
Nazi 
quotations. 


Earlier, 
Ernst 
Bertram 
had 
frankly 
subtitled 
his 
interpretation 
“Attempt 
at 
a 
Mythology”: 
but 
who 
checked 
his 
quotations? 
And 
whose 
Nietzsche 
image, 
except 
the 
sister’s, 
was 
taken 
more 
seriously 
from 
1918, 
when 
Bertram’s 
Nietzsche 
appeared, 
until 
1933 
when 
Hitler 
broke 
out? 
Or 
who 
checked 
Jaspers’ 
quotations 
in 
their 
context? 
(The 
English 
translation 
of 
his 
Nietzsche 
omits 
all 
source 
references, 
as 
Bertram 
had 
done.) 


It 
would 
be 
pointless 
to 
rescue 
from 
their 
imminent 
oblivion 
many 
lesser 
figures 
who 
have 
also 
associated 
their 
names 
with 
Nietzsche’s, 
writing 
about 
him 
without 
having 
read 
carefully 
the 
works 
they 
discuss, 
or 
editing 
him 
by 
selecting 
passages 
from 
hopeless 
mistranslations 
that 
these 
professors 
lacked 
the 
German 
or 
the 
patience 
to 
check. 
Yet 
such 
publications 
are 
taken 
seriously 
and 
used 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
many 
discussions 
in 
colleges 
and 
universities. 


While 
some 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
self-interpretations 
are 
much 
less 
persuasive 
than 
others, 
all 
of 
them 
have 
several 
inestimable 
advantages 
over 
almost 
everything 
that 
passes 
as 
serious 
literature 
about 
him: 
he 
did 
not 
discuss 
any 
of 
his 
works 
without 
having 
read 
them 
carefully, 
more 
than 
once; 
indeed, 
he 
did 
not 
discuss 
any 
without 
knowing 
all 
of 
them, 
in 
the 
sequence 
in 
which 



they 
were 
written—and, 
of 
course, 
in 
the 
original. 
He 
also 
knew 
all 
of 
his 
letters, 
as 
well 
as 
his 
unpublished 
fragments 
and 
notes. 
And 
he 
wrote 
about 
his 
oeuvre 
with 
singular 
penetration, 
wit, 
and 
style. 


Let 
us 
be 
specific: 
Do 
his 
comments 
on 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
make 
sense? 
Very 
little 
written 
on 
that 
book 
is 
as 
illuminating, 
and 
most 
discussions 
of 
the 
book 
are 
dated 
by 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
discussion, 
which 
long 
antedates 
them. 


Yet 
Ecce 
Homo 
has 
its 
faults. 
It 
contains 
all 
too 
many 
references 
to 
Zarathustra—most 
of 
them 
embarrassing—and 
the 
numerous 
long 
quotations 
from 
that 
book 
are 
almost 
rendered 
pointless 
by 
Zarathustra’s 
great 
posthumous 
success: 
the 
quotations 
were 
intended 
for 
readers 
who 
did 
not 
know 
that 
book. 
And 
although 
Nietzsche 
has 
often 
been 
linked 
with 
German 
nationalism, 
his 
remarks 
about 
the 
Germans 
are 
open 
to 
criticism 
for 
being 
too 
extreme 
in 
stressing 
what 
he 
finds 
abominable. 


We 
return 
to 
the 
question 
of 
naturalism. 
Nietzsche’s 
portrait 
of 
the 
Germans 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
be 
objective. 
It 
partakes 
more 
nearly 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
George 
Grosz, 
who, 
after 
World 
War 
I, 
entitled 
a 
collection 
of 
his 
graphic 
attacks 
on 
his 
countrymen, 
Ecce 
Homo. 
But 
we 
also 
hear 
the 
anguished 
cry 
of 
one 
who 
sees—foresees—himself 
mistaken 
for 
a 
writer 
he 
is 
not: 
for 
an 
apostle 
of 
military 
power 
and 
empire, 
a 
nationalist, 
and 
even 
a 
racist. 
In 
order 
to 
define 
himself 
emphatically, 
Nietzsche 
underlines 
(too 
often) 
and 
shrieks 
—to 
no 
avail. 
Those 
who 
construe 
the 
overman 
in 
evolutionary 
terms 
he 
calls 
“oxen”—in 
vain. 
Respected 
professors 
still 
write 
books 
in 
which 
Nietzsche’s 
ethics 
is 
presented 
as 
“evolutionary.” 


The 
break 
with 
Wagner? 
Nietzsche’s 
picture 
is 
stylized, 
not 
false. 
There 
is, 
of 
course, 
hindsight 
in 
it; 
but 
readers 
of 
Sartre 
should 
know, 
if 
they 
have 
not 
learned 
it 
firsthand 
from 
Nietzsche 
himself, 
that 
an 
act 
is 
one 
event, 
and 
the 
way 
we 
interpret 
it 
afterward 
and 
relate 
ourselves 
to 
it 
is 
another. 
Looking 
back 
on 
the 
year 
in 
which 
he 
resigned 
from 
the 
university, 
published 
Human, 
All-Too-Human 
with 
a 
dedication 
to 
Voltaire—turning 
from 
German 
romanticism 
to 
the 
French 
enlightenment, 
and 
from 
Wagner 
to 
independence 
—he 
felt, 
more 
clearly 
than 
he 
had 
felt 
it 
at 
the 
time, 
that 
this 
had 
been 
his 
Rubicon, 
the 
turning 
point 
in 
his 
life. 
Can 
one 
deny 
that 
it 
was? 


For 
all 
that, 
is 
Wagner 
represented 
in 
a 
Manichaean 
spirit, 
as 
the 
force 
of 
evil, 
as 
a 
dragon? 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
portrait 
is 
imbued 
with 
gratitude 
and 
love—with 
amor 
fati, 
love 
of 
fate. 
There 
is 
no 
“if 
only” 
in 
this 
autobiography, 
and 
there 
are 
no 
excuses. 
A 
man 
who 
was 
in 
physical 
agony 
much 
of 
his 
adult 
life 
and 
warned 
by 
his 
doctors 
not 
to 
read 
or 
write 
much 



lest 
he 
strain 
his 
half-blind 
eyes, 
does 
not 
once 
complain. 
He 
is 
thankful 
for 
his 
illness 
and 
tells 
us 
how 
it 
made 
his 
life 
better. 


The 
philosophical 
and 
religious 
literature 
of 
the 
world 
does 
not 
contain 
many 
sayings 
that 
equal 
the 
wisdom 
and 
nobility 
of 
Zarathustra’s 
challenge: 
“If 
you 
have 
an 
enemy, 
do 
not 
requite 
him 
evil 
with 
good, 
for 
that 
would 
put 
him 
to 
shame. 
Rather 
prove 
that 
he 
did 
you 
some 
good.”3 
In 
Ecce 
Homo 
Nietzsche 
embodies 
this 
attitude, 
this 
triumph 
over 
ressentiment. 
Instead 
of 
bearing 
a 
grudge 
toward 
the 
world 
that 
treated 
him 
so 
cruelly, 
instead 
of 
succumbing 
to 
the 
rancor 
of 
sickness, 
he 
relates 
the 
story 
of 
his 
life 
and 
work 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
gratitude—and 
goes 
out 
of 
his 
way 
to 
pay 
his 
respects 
to 
Paul 
Rée 
and 
Lou 
Salomé,4 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
fallen 
out. 


Ecce 
Homo, 
“Dionysus 
versus 
the 
Crucified”: 
the 
contrast 
with 
the 
Jesus 
of 
the 
Gospels 
is 
central. 
The 
Jesus 
of 
the 
Gospels—who, 
Nietzsche 
argued 
in 
The 
Antichrist, 
is 
different 
in 
this 
respect 
from 
the 
historic 
Jesus—is 
far 
from 
being 
above 
resentment: 
not 
only 
does 
he 
obsessively 
slander 
his 
enemies, 
he 
stands 
opposed 
to 
this 
world 
and 
this 
life, 
and 
neither 
takes 
nor 
teaches 
any 
joy 
in 
small 
pleasures 
and 
beauties. 
The 
strange 
emphasis 
on 
little 
things, 
material 
factors 
generally 
thought 
beneath 
the 
notice 
of 
philosophers 
and 
sages, 
that 
distinguishes 
the 
first 
two 
chapters 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
has 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
this 
light, 
too. 
This 
theme 
was 
picked 
up 
by 
Camus, 
also 
with 
an 
anti-Christian 
pathos, 
but 
restrained 
by 
lyricism 
and 
his 
distinctive 
charm. 
Nietzsche, 
like 
Socrates 
who 
was 
said 
to 
look 
like 
a 
satyr, 
disdains 
charm 
and 
embraces 
irony 
and 
sarcasm: 
he 
is 
not 
ingratiating, 
but 
wants 
to 
give 
offense. 
Is 
there 
no 
resentment 
in 
that? 


In 
the 
case 
of 
Socrates, 
Nietzsche 
emphasized 
the 
element 
of 
rancor 
in 
his 
sarcasm—what 
he 
called 
Bosheit, 
malice. 
And 
in 
that 
case 
many 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
see 
Socrates 
in 
this 
light 
and, 
because 
Socrates 
was 
felt 
to 
be 
ideal, 
tranquil, 
the 
perfect 
sage, 
took 
offense 
at 
Nietzsche’s 
portrait. 
Only 
the 
safe 
distance 
of 
more 
than 
twenty 
centuries 
could 
make 
the 
hero 
of 
the 
Apology 
look 
saintly. 
No 
doubt, 
those 
who 
had 
heard 
his 
apology, 
felt 
what 
Nietzsche 
saw—and 
had 
smarted 
under 
it 
for 
years. 
After 
all, 
what 
Socrates 
boasted 
of 
was 
perfectly 
true: 
he 
had 
taken 
pleasure 
in 
engaging 
men 
of 
reputation 
in 
the 
marketplace 
to 
humiliate 
them 
before 
the 
crowd 
that 
gathered—often 
(assuming, 
as 
is 
surely 
fair, 
that 
Plato 
did 
not 
mean 
to 
slander 
Socrates) 
by 
using 
clever 
debater’s 
tricks. 
He 
had 
a 
wicked 
sense 
of 
humor 
and 
found 
all 
this 
very 
funny; 
those 
he 
bested 
certainly 
did 
not. 


Goethe, 
too, 
possessed 
not 
only 
the 
serenity 
of 
amor 
fati5 
but 
also 
an 



Olympian 
malice. 
But 
even 
if 
Nietzsche 
is 
in 
noble 
company, 
was 
there 
not 
after 
all 
resentment 
in 
him, 
even 
in 
Ecce 
Homo? 
It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
what 
Nietzsche 
called 
in 
The 
Gay 
Science 
“giving 
style 
to 
one’s 
character.” 
The 
negative 
feelings, 
he 
taught, 
should 
not 
be 
suppressed, 
much 
less 
extirpated; 
they 
should 
be 
sublimated. 
And 
in 
Ecce 
Homo 
he 
discusses 
how 
he 
was 
both 
a 
No-saying 
and 
a 
Yes-saying 
spirit. 
The 
negative 
feelings 
are 
not 
vented 
on 
individuals 
or 
directed 
against 
life 
or 
the 
world; 
they 
are 
mobilized 
in 
the 
service 
of 
life 
and 
creativity 
against 
obstructions, 
movements, 
causes. 


Ultimate 
nobility 
must 
rise 
above 
rancor 
and 
must 
yet 
be 
capable 
of 
echoing 
Voltaire’s 
cry, 
écrasez 
l’infâme.6 
Resentment 
is 
reprehensible, 
but 
so 
is 
the 
failure 
to 
engage 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
infamy. 
It 
is 
only 
when 
the 
infamy 
to 
be 
crushed 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
Christianity 
that 
most 
readers 
recoil. 
But 
Nietzsche’s 
attack, 
of 
course, 
depends 
on 
his 
conception 
of 
Christianity 
and 
—as 
he 
himself 
insists—cannot 
be 
understood 
at 
all 
except 
as 
a 
part 
of 
his 
campaign 
against 
resentment. 


Indeed, 
this 
attack 
seems 
to 
me 
much 
more 
successfully 
stylized 
than 
Nietzsche’s 
denunciations 
of 
the 
Germans. 
Since 
World 
War 
II 
the 
Germans 
may 
seem 
fair 
game, 
but 
Nietzsche’s 
indictments 
are 
sometimes 
stained 
by 
his 
own 
wounds: 
in 
more 
than 
one 
passage 
he 
falls 
short 
of 
his 
own 
standards, 
and 
resentment 
clings 
to 
him 
like 
a 
leech. 


Nietzsche’s 
ties 
to 
the 
pre-Christian 
world 
are 
stronger 
than 
is 
usually 
supposed, 
though 
this 
should 
not 
surprise 
us 
in 
a 
classical 
philologist 
who, 
even 
in 
his 
teens, 
nourished 
his 
spirit 
and 
emotions 
on 
Greek 
literature 
and 
thought. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
place 
for 
a 
lengthy 
survey 
of 
classical 
inspirations, 
but 
in 
addition 
to 
Socrates’ 
Apology 
we 
must 
mention 
Aristotle’s 
portrait 
of 
the 
great-souled 
man 
in 
the 
Nicomachean 
Ethics. 
It 
is 
a 
commonplace 
that 
Aristotle’s 
ethics 
was 
based 
in 
large 
measure 
on 
the 
morality 
of 
Athenian 
gentlemen, 
and 
that 
the 
man 
described 
in 
this 
passage 
represents 
not 
merely 
Aristotle’s 
ideal 
but 
a 
type 
very 
much 
admired 
in 
Athens. 
It 
has 
not 
been 
widely 
noticed—and 
for 
all 
I 
know, 
I 
may 
have 
been 
the 
first 
to 
point 
this 
out 
some 
years 
ago—that 
Aristotle’s 
portrait 
was 
probably 
inspired 
in 
part 
by 
Socrates’ 
Apology. 
In 
any 
case, 
both 
left 
their 
mark 
on 
Ecce 
Homo. 


“A 
person 
is 
thought 
to 
be 
great-souled 
if 
he 
claims 
much 
and 
deserves 
much.” 
Aristotle’s 
words—antithetical 
as 
they 
are 
to 
the 
Christian 
influence 
on 
modern 
morality—represent 
one 
of 
the 
leitmotifs 
of 
Ecce 
Homo. 
“He 
does 
not 
bear 
a 
grudge” 
represents 
another. 
That 
he 
does 
not 
speak 
evil 
“even 
of 
his 
enemies, 
except 
when 
he 
deliberately 
intends 
to 
give 
offense,” 
is 
a 
third. 



But 
Aristotle’s 
whole 
portrait 
is 
relevant.7 
And 
to 
Nietzsche’s 
central 
contrast 
of 
the 
New 
Testament 
and 
the 
Greeks, 
Greek 
tragedy, 
Thucydides, 
and 
the 
Iliad 
are 
relevant, 
too. 
And 
so 
is 
Greek 
comedy; 
so 
are 
the 
satyrs, 
the 
companions 
of 
Dionysus; 
so 
are 
Greek 
laughter 
and 
Socratic 
irony. 
It 
should 
not 
be 
assumed 
that 
the 
chapter 
titles 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
are 
devoid 
of 
all 
humor. 
Neither, 
of 
course, 
is 
Nietzsche 
only 
speaking 
in 
jest 
when 
he 
explains, 
“Why 
I 
Write 
Such 
Good 
Books”—any 
more 
than 
George 
Bernard 
Shaw 
was 
only 
jesting 
when 
he 
spoke 
in 
a 
similar 
vein. 


Looking 
for 
a 
pre-Christian, 
Greek 
symbol 
that 
he 
might 
oppose 
to 
“the 
Crucified,” 
Nietzsche 
found 
Dionysus. 
His 
“Dionysus” 
is 
neither 
the 
god 
of 
the 
ancient 
Dionysian 
festivals 
nor 
the 
god 
Nietzsche 
had 
played 
off 
against 
Apollo 
in 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy, 
although 
he 
does, 
of 
course, 
bear 
some 
of 
the 
features 
of 
both. 
In 
the 
later 
works 
of 
Nietzsche, 
“Dionysus” 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
spirit 
of 
unrestrained 
passion, 
but 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
affirmation 
of 
life 
with 
all 
its 
suffering 
and 
terror. 
“The 
problem,” 
Nietzsche 
explained 
in 
a 
note 
that 
was 
later 
included 
in 
the 
posthumous 
Will 
to 
Power 
(section 
1052), 
“is 
that 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
suffering: 
whether 
a 
Christian 
meaning 
or 
a 
tragic 
meaning.… 
The 
tragic 
man 
affirms 
even 
the 
harshest 
suffering.” 
And 
Ecce 
Homo 
is, 
not 
least 
of 
all, 
Nietzsche’s 
final 
affirmation 
of 
his 
own 
cruel 
life.

A 
Note 
on 
the 
Publication 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 


Many 
who 
have 
never 
carefully 
read 
any 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works 
have 
read 
about 
two 
German 
editions 
of 
the 
works 
that 
elicited 
some 
sensational 
but 
uninformed 
comments 
in 
print. 
The 
first 
was 
Karl 
Schlechta’s 
edition 
of 
all 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
books 
and 
a 
selection 
from 
his 
notes, 
fragments, 
and 
letters, 
in 
three 
volumes. 
But 
Schlechta 
simply 
reprinted 
the 
previously 
published 
versions 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
and 
need 
not 
be 
considered 
here. 


The 
second 
was 
Erich 
F. 
Podach’s 
book, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke 
des 
Zusammenbruchs 
(1961),1 
which 
offered 
texts 
of 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner, 
The 
Antichrist, 
Ecce 
Homo, 
and 
the 
so-called 
Dionysus 
Dithyrambs 
that 
were 
said 
to 
supersede 
all 
previous 
editions. 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere2 
how 
ill-
founded 
Podach’s 
strident 
claims 
are. 
Here 
we 
need 
only 
consider 
his 
handling 
of 
Ecce 
Homo. 
He 
aims 
to 
show 
that 
“The 
hitherto 
familiar 
Ecce 
Homo 
does 
not 
exist” 
(p. 
208). 
This 
sensational 
charge 
has 
to 
be 
met 
here, 
even 
if 
some 
readers 
should 
prefer 
to 
skim 
the 
next 
six 
paragraphs. 


Podach 
prints 
the 
manuscript 
with 
Nietzsche’s 
editorial 
directions, 
such 
as 
requests 
to 
insert 
or 
move 
passages; 
he 
reproduces 
alternative 
versions 
of 
the 
same 
passages, 
including 
pages 
that 
had 
been 
pasted 
over; 
and 
he 
admits 
that 
he 
has 
“not 
indicated 
where 
whole 
sections 
in 
the 
manuscript 
sent 
to 
the 
printer 
are 
crossed 
out. 
Here 
some 
of 
the 
texts 
show 
plainly 
that 
they 
are 
variants 
or 
preliminary 
versions, 
while 
in 
other 
cases 
[very 
few] 
it 
cannot 
be 
decided 
whether 
N 
or 
Gast 
[Nietzsche’s 
young 
friend 
who 
helped 
him 
with 
editorial 
chores 
and 
proofs] 
has 
deleted 
them” 
(p. 
408). 


In 
fact, 
Ecce 
Homo 
was 
begun 
October 
15, 
1888, 
on 
Nietzsche’s 
forty-
fourth 
birthday, 
and 
finished 
November 
4. 
A 
few 
days 
later 
Nietzsche 
sent 
the 
manuscript 
to 
his 
publisher, 
Naumann; 
but 
on 
November 
20 
he 
mentioned 
some 
additions 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Georg 
Brandes, 
the 
Danish 
critic 
who 
was 
the 
first 
to 
lecture 
on 
Nietzsche 
at 
a 
university 
(Copenhagen); 
and 
then 
he 
also 
mentioned 
additions 
to 
Naumann. 
On 
a 
postcard, 
November 
27, 
he 
asked 
Naumann 
to 
return 
“the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
MS 
… 
because 
I 
still 
want 
to 



insert 
some 
things,” 
and 
explained 
that 
he 
meant 
“the 
whole 
second 
half 
of 
the 
MS, 
beginning 
with 
the 
section 
entitled 
‘Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra.’ 
I 
assume 
that 
this 
won’t 
delay 
the 
printing 
for 
even 
a 
moment 
as 
I 
shall 
send 
back 
the 
MS 
immediately.” 
On 
December 
1 
he 
acknowledged 
receipt 
of 
the 
second 
half 
but 
requested 
the 
return 
of 
the 
whole 
MS, 
including 
the 
additions: 
“I 
want 
to 
give 
you 
a 
MS 
as 
good 
as 
the 
last 
one, 
at 
the 
risk 
that 
I 
have 
to 
be 
a 
copier 
for 
another 
week.” 
On 
December 
3 
Naumann 
replied 
that 
he 
was 
returning 
the 
MS, 
but 
“copying 
it 
once 
more 
I 
do 
not 
consider 
necessary; 
I 
merely 
should 
especially 
recommend 
that 
you 
read 
the 
proofs 
carefully 
although 
I 
shall 
make 
a 
point 
of 
doing 
likewise.” 
This 
shows 
plainly 
how 
wrong 
Podach’s 
claims 
are: 
the 
publisher 
found 
the 
manuscript 
finished, 
clear, 
and 
printable. 


Nor 
did 
Nietzsche 
keep 
it 
long. 
On 
December 
6, 
he 
telegraphed 
Naumann: 
“MS 
back. 
Everything 
reworked 
[umgearbeitet].” 
And 
on 
the 
eighth, 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Gast: 
“I 
sent 
Ecce 
Homo 
back 
to 
C. 
G. 
Naumann 
day 
before 
yesterday 
after 
laying 
it 
once 
more 
on 
the 
gold 
scales 
from 
the 
first 
to 
the 
last 
word 
to 
set 
my 
conscience 
finally 
at 
rest.” 


All 
this 
information 
was 
given 
by 
Professor 
Raoul 
Richter 
in 
his 
long 
postscript 
to 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
1908, 
and 
Richter 
also 
described 
the 
manuscript: 
“The 
manuscript 
is 
written 
clearly 
and 
cleanly 
from 
beginning 
to 
end, 
so 
that 
even 
every 
untrained 
person 
can 
read 
it 
quickly 
on 
the 
whole, 
without 
trouble. 
Changes 
have 
been 
made 
either 
by 
striking 
things 
out 
(with 
pencil 
or 
ink) 
or 
by 
pasting 
things 
over. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
editor 
[Richter] 
has 
copied 
the 
original 
version 
in 
order 
to 
help 
provide 
a 
basis 
for 
a 
later 
critical 
edition. 
For 
that, 
ample 
use 
would 
also 
have 
to 
be 
made 
of 
the 
drafts 
and 
variants 
found 
in 
the 
three 
octavo 
notebooks 
(…)3 
and 
some 
separate 
sheets. 
Nietzsche’s 
corrections 
in 
the 
manuscript 
have 
been 
entered 
with 
scrupulous 
exactness; 
where, 
owing 
to 
lack 
of 
space, 
some 
additions 
had 
to 
be 
written 
in 
miniature 
script, 
they 
are 
little 
graphic 
masterpieces: 
so 
readable 
is 
every 
letter, 
and 
so 
exactly 
is 
the 
bracket 
of 
insertion 
drawn 
above 
the 
line 
… 
Slips 
that 
affect 
the 
spelling 
or 
grammar 
are 
very 
rare 
and 
probably 
rarer 
than 
in 
the 
average 
manuscript 
submitted 
to 
a 
printer” 
(p. 
146). 


Neither 
Richter’s 
probity 
nor 
the 
authenticity 
of 
the 
letters 
I 
have 
cited, 
and 
of 
any 
number 
of 
others 
that 
corroborate 
them, 
has 
ever 
been 
questioned. 
Podach 
simply 
ignores 
all 
of 
this. 
Still, 
two 
departures 
of 
his 
version 
from 
the 
traditional 
ones 
ought 
to 
be 
mentioned 
here. 
First, 
he 
omits 
section 
7 
of 
the 
second 
chapter, 
which 
contains 
Nietzsche’s 
well-known 
poem 
that 
is 



sometimes 
called 
“Venice,” 
sometimes 
“Gondola 
Song.” 
Podach 
prints 
this 
section 
under 
the 
title 
“Intermezzo,” 
after 
the 
second 
section 
of 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner. 
This 
is 
understandable, 
for 
that 
is 
where 
it 
appeared 
in 
the 
unpublished 
first 
printing 
of 
the 
latter 
book 
(1889; 
I 
have 
a 
copy 
of 
that), 
though 
not 
in 
any 
published 
version. 
But 
on 
December 
20 
Nietzsche 
sent 
his 
publisher 
a 
postcard: 
“I 
have 
sent 
you 
a 
single 
sheet 
with 
the 
title 
‘Intermezzo,’ 
with 
the 
request 
to 
insert 
it 
in 
N. 
contra 
W. 
Now 
let 
us 
rather 
insert 
it 
in 
Ecce, 
for 
which 
it 
was 
intended 
originally[!]—in 
the 
second 
chapter 
(Why 
I 
am 
so 
clever), 
as 
section 
5 
[sic]. 
The 
following 
numbers 
will 
have 
to 
be 
changed 
accordingly. 
The 
title 
‘Intermezzo,’ 
of 
course, 
goes.” 
Two 
days 
later 
Nietzsche 
wrote 
Gast 
similarly. 
But 
a 
few 
days 
later 
he 
received 
proofs 
of 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
that 
naturally 
still 
included 
this 
section, 
and 
he 
did 
not 
delete 
it 
but 
made 
some 
slight 
corrections 
in 
it. 
Richter 
printed 
it 
in 
his 
edition 
of 
Ecce 
Homo, 
with 
the 
corrections 
Nietzsche 
had 
made 
in 
the 
proofs. 
Podach 
mentions 
none 
of 
this 
but 
says 
simply 
that 
Gast, 
“for 
his 
own 
glory 
and 
the 
enhancement 
of 
Ecce 
Homo, 
embodied 
the 
‘Intermezzo’ 
printed 
in 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
in 
the 
manuscript” 
(p. 
188; 
cf. 
also 
p. 
201). 
While 
this 
is 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
tenor 
of 
Podach’s 
book, 
it 
seems 
sensible 
to 
me 
to 
include 
this 
section 
in 
Ecce 
Homo, 
in 
keeping 
with 
all 
previous 
editions 
except 
Podach’s. 


Finally, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Ecce 
Homo, 
Podach 
prints 
a 
three-page 
poem 
entitled 
“Ruhm 
und 
Ewigkeit” 
(fame 
and 
eternity). 
Here 
he 
follows 
Richter’s 
edition, 
while 
all 
subsequent 
editions 
have 
omitted 
the 
poem. 
This 
did 
not 
involve 
any 
suppression, 
although 
Podach 
is 
very 
scornful 
of 
all 
who 
have 
omitted 
it 
at 
this 
point: 
the 
poem 
has 
usually 
been 
included 
in 
the 
so-called 
Dionysus 
Dithyrambs 
and 
is 
readily 
available 
in 
volumes 
containing 
Nietzsche’s 
poems. 
Podach 
considers 
it 
important—it 
is 
not 
clear 
why 
or 
for 
what—that 
Nietzsche 
wanted 
to 
conclude 
all 
of 
his 
last 
works 
with 
poems. 
But 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
the 
last 
two 
books 
he 
saw 
through 
the 
press, 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 
and 
The 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols, 
did 
not 
end 
with 
poems; 
neither 
did 
The 
Antichrist; 
and 
as 
for 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
and 
Ecce 
Homo, 
in 
his 
last 
communications 
to 
his 
publisher, 
Nietzsche 
asked 
Naumann 
January 
1, 
1889, 
to 
return 
one 
final 
poem, 
and 
January 
2, 
1889, 
to 
return 
both. 
That 
he 
did 
not 
want 
them 
published 
in 
their 
present 
form 
at 
the 
end 
of 
these 
books 
seems 
clear; 
that 
he 
would 
have 
revised 
them, 
if 
he 
had 
not 
collapsed 
on 
January 
3, 
is 
possible. 
But 
it 
is 
no 
less 
possible 
and 
actually 
more 
likely, 
I 
think, 
that 
he 
realized 
that 
the 
books 
would 
be 
better 
without 
these 
poems. 



After 
Nietzsche’s 
collapse, 
his 
family 
decided 
not 
to 
publish 
any 
further 
books 
by 
him. 
The 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols 
did 
appear, 
as 
scheduled, 
in 
January 
1889, 
but 
the 
three 
books 
written 
after 
that 
were 
held 
up. 
In 
1891 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra 
was 
printed, 
together 
with 
the 
Dionysus 
Dithyrambs—and 
published 
in 
1892. 
By 
1895 
there 
was 
sufficient 
interest 
in 
Nietzsche 
to 
include 
both 
The 
Antichrist 
and 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
in 
volume 
VIII 
of 
a 
new 
edition 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works. 
But 
Ecce 
Homo 
was 
held 
back, 
perhaps 
partly 
because 
it 
might 
compromise 
Nietzsche, 
partly 
because 
his 
sister 
found 
it 
useful 
to 
quote 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
self-interpretations 
when 
she 
wrote 
prefaces 
for 
new 
editions 
of 
his 
books. 
As 
long 
as 
she 
knew 
Ecce 
Homo 
and 
the 
public 
did 
not, 
her 
biographies 
of 
her 
brother 
as 
well 
as 
her 
occasional 
journalistic 
pieces 
had 
a 
special 
authority. 


Finally, 
in 
1908 
the 
book 
appeared 
in 
an 
expensive 
limited 
edition 
of 
1250 
copies. 
It 
was 
not 
brought 
out 
by 
a 
publisher 
who 
had 
been 
previously 
associated 
with 
Nietzsche, 
but 
by 
the 
Insel 
Verlag; 
and 
the 
title, 
binding, 
and 
ornaments 
had 
all 
been 
designed 
by 
Henry 
van 
de 
Velde 
in 
the 
Jugendstil 
of 
that 
time. 
There 
is 
no 
English 
word 
for 
that 
style: 
one 
uses 
the 
French 
phrase 
art 
nouveau. 
Nietzsche, 
who 
had 
written 
Gast, 
November 
26, 
1888, 
that 
he 
wanted 
Ecce 
to 
be 
designed 
just 
like 
Twilight—that 
is, 
very 
simply, 
with 
clear 
print 
and 
wide 
margins 
and 
nothing 
to 
distract 
the 
eye 
from 
the 
text— 
would 
surely 
have 
found 
the 
book 
hideous. 
But 
Richter’s 
postscript 
was 
dignified 
and 
informative. 


Two 
years 
later, 
in 
1910, 
Ecce 
Homo 
was 
included 
in 
the 
new 
volume 
XV 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works, 
which 
along 
with 
volume 
XVI 
(1911) 
contained 
a 
greatly 
enlarged 
and 
entirely 
remodeled 
version 
of 
the 
Will 
to 
Power 
and 
replaced 
the 
old 
volume 
XV 
(1901), 
which 
had 
contained 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
the 
Will 
to 
Power. 
Many 
libraries 
acquired 
only 
volume 
XVI, 
adding 
it 
to 
their 
old 
sets: 
as 
a 
result, 
many 
sets 
of 
the 
so-called 
Grossoktav 
edition4 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works 
lack 
Ecce 
Homo. 
But 
henceforth 
Ecce 
was 
included 
in 
editions 
of 
the 
works 
and 
no 
longer 
hard 
to 
come 
by. 
And 
all 
editions 
of 
the 
book, 
except 
for 
Podach’s, 
followed 
the 
first 
edition, 
except 
that 
they 
omitted 
the 
poem 
at 
the 
end. 


The 
present 
translation 
follows 
the 
standard 
editions, 
but 
the 
notes 
and 
Appendix 
also 
offer 
previously 
untranslated 
variants 
and 
passages 
from 
drafts, 
along 
with 
other 
information 
and 
comments 
not 
previously 
found 
in 
any 
edition 
in 
any 
language. 
In 
a 
way, 
all 
this 
apparatus 
weighs 
down 
a 
book 
written 
with 
light 
feet; 
but 
Ecce 
is 
not 
easily 
accessible, 
and 
on 
a 
first 
or 



second 
reading 
the 
commentary 
may 
prove 
helpful. 
The 
form 
in 
which 
it 
is 
offered 
should 
make 
it 
easy 
to 
reread 
Ecce 
Homo 
straight 
through, 
without 
any 
editorial 
interruptions. 


Perhaps 
one 
or 
another 
reader 
of 
the 
book 
will 
react 
in 
a 
manner 
similar 
to 
“Napoleon’s 
surprise 
when 
he 
came 
to 
see 
Goethe: 
it 
shows 
what 
people 
had 
associated 
with 
the 
‘Germar 
spirit’ 
for 
centuries. 
‘Voilà

Preface 



1 


Seeing 
that 
before 
long 
I 
must 
confront 
humanity 
with 
the 
most 
difficult 
demand 
ever 
made 
of 
it, 
it 
seems 
indispensable 
to 
me 
to 
say 
who 
I 
am. 
Really, 
one 
should 
know 
it, 
for 
I 
have 
not 
left 
myself 
“without 
testimony.” 
But 
the 
disproportion 
between 
the 
greatness 
of 
my 
task 
and 
the 
smallness 
of 
my 
contemporaries 
has 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
has 
neither 
heard 
nor 
even 
seen 
me. 
I 
live 
on 
my 
own 
credit; 
it 
is 
perhaps 
a 
mere 
prejudice 
that 
I 
live. 


I 
only 
need 
to 
speak 
with 
one 
of 
the 
“educated” 
who 
come 
to 
the 
Upper 
Engadine1 
for 
the 
summer, 
and 
I 
am 
convinced 
that 
I 
do 
not 
live. 


Under 
these 
circumstances 
I 
have 
a 
duty 
against 
which 
my 
habits, 
even 
more 
the 
pride 
of 
my 
instincts, 
revolt 
at 
bottom—namely, 
to 
say: 
Hear 
me! 
For 
I 
am 
such 
and 
such 
a 
person. 
Above 
all, 
do 
not 
mistake 
me 
for 
someone 
else. 



2 


I 
am, 
for 
example, 
by 
no 
means 
a 
bogey, 
or 
a 
moralistic 
monster—I 
am 
actually 
the 
very 
opposite 
of 
the 
type 
of 
man 
who 
so 
far 
has 
been 
revered 
as 
virtuous. 
Between 
ourselves, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
precisely 
this 
is 
part 
of 
my 
pride. 
I 
am 
a 
disciple 
of 
the 
philosopher 
Dionysus; 
I 
should 
prefer 
to 
be 
even 
a 
satyr 
to 
being 
a 
saint. 
But 
one 
should 
really 
read 
this 
essay. 
Perhaps 
I 
have 
succeeded; 
perhaps 
this 
essay 
had 
no 
other 
meaning 
than 
to 
give 
expression 
to 
this 
contrast 
in 
a 
cheerful 
and 
philanthropic 
manner. 


The 
last 
thing 
I 
should 
promise 
would 
be 
to 
“improve” 
mankind.2 
No 
new 
idols 
are 
erected 
by 
me; 
let 
the 
old 
ones 
learn 
what 
feet 
of 
clay 
mean. 
Overthrowing 
idols 
(my 
word 
for 
“ideals”)— 
that 
comes 
closer 
to 
being 
part 
of 
my 
craft. 
One 
has 
deprived 
reality 
of 
its 
value, 
its 
meaning, 
its 
truthfulness, 
to 
precisely 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
one 
has 
mendaciously 
invented 
an 
ideal 
world. 


The 
“true 
world” 
and 
the 
“apparent 
world”—that 
means: 
the 
mendaciously 
invented 
world 
and 
reality. 


The 
lie 
of 
the 
ideal 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
curse 
on 
reality; 
on 
account 
of 
it, 
mankind 
itself 
has 
become 
mendacious 
and 
false 
down 
to 
its 
most 
fundamental 
instincts—to 
the 
point 
of 
worshipping 
the 
opposite 
values 
of 
those 
which 
alone 
would 
guarantee 
its 
health, 
its 
future, 
the 
lofty 
right 
to 
its 
future. 



3 


Those 
who 
can 
breathe 
the 
air 
of 
my 
writings 
know 
that 
it 
is 
an 
air 
of 
the 
heights, 
a 
strong 
air. 
One 
must 
be 
made 
for 
it. 
Otherwise 
there 
is 
no 
small 
danger 
that 
one 
may 
catch 
cold 
in 
it. 
The 
ice 
is 
near, 
the 
solitude 
tremendous 
—but 
how 
calmly 
all 
things 
lie 
in 
the 
light! 
How 
freely 
one 
breathes! 
How 
much 
one 
feels 
beneath 
oneself! 


Philosophy, 
as 
I 
have 
so 
far 
understood 
and 
lived 
it, 
means 
living 
voluntarily 
among 
ice 
and 
high 
mountains—seeking 
out 
everything 
strange 
and 
questionable 
in 
existence, 
everything 
so 
far 
placed 
under 
a 
ban 
by 
morality. 
Long 
experience, 
acquired 
in 
the 
course 
of 
such 
wanderings 
in 
what 
is 
forbidden, 
taught 
me 
to 
regard 
the 
causes 
that 
so 
far 
have 
prompted 
moralizing 
and 
idealizing 
in 
a 
very 
different 
light 
from 
what 
may 
seem 
desirable: 
the 
hidden 
history 
of 
the 
philosophers, 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
great 
names, 
came 
to 
light 
for 
me. 


How 
much 
truth 
does 
a 
spirit 
endure, 
how 
much 
truth 
does 
it 
dare? 
More 
and 
more 
that 
became 
for 
me 
the 
real 
measure 
of 
value. 
Error 
(faith 
in 
the 
ideal) 
is 
not 
blindness, 
error 
is 
cowardice. 


Every 
attainment, 
every 
step 
forward 
in 
knowledge, 
follows 
from 
courage, 
from 
hardness 
against 
oneself, 
from 
cleanliness 
in 
relation 
to 
oneself. 


I 
do 
not 
refute 
ideals, 
I 
merely 
put 
on 
gloves 
before 
them. 


Nitimur 
in 
vetitum:3 
in 
this 
sign 
my 
philosophy 
will 
triumph 
one 
day, 
for 
what 
one 
has 
forbidden 
so 
far 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle 
has 
always 
been—truth 
alone. 



4 


Among 
my 
writings 
my 
Zarathustra 
stands 
to 
my 
mind 
by 
itself. 
With 
that 
I 
have 
given 
mankind 
the 
greatest 
present 
that 
has 
ever 
been 
made 
to 
it 
so 
far. 
This 
book, 
with 
a 
voice 
bridging 
centuries, 
is 
not 
only 
the 
highest 
book 
there 
is, 
the 
book 
that 
is 
truly 
characterized 
by 
the 
air 
of 
the 
heights—the 
whole 
fact 
of 
man 
lies 
beneath 
it 
at 
a 
tremendous 
distance—it 
is 
also 
the 
deepest, 
born 
out 
of 
the 
innermost 
wealth 
of 
truth, 
an 
inexhaustible 
well 
to 
which 
no 
pail 
descends 
without 
coming 
up 
again 
filled 
with 
gold 
and 
goodness. 
Here 
no 
“prophet” 
is 
speaking, 
none 
of 
those 
gruesome 
hybrids 
of 
sickness 
and 
will 
to 
power 
whom 
people 
call 
founders 
of 
religions. 
Above 
all, 
one 
must 
hear 
aright 
the 
tone 
that 
comes 
from 
this 
mouth, 
the 
halcyon 
tone, 
lest 
one 
should 
do 
wretched 
injustice 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
its 
wisdom. 


“It 
is 
the 
stillest 
words 
that 
bring 
on 
the 
storm. 
Thoughts 
that 
come 
on 
doves’ 
feet 
guide 
the 
world.”4 


The 
figs 
are 
falling 
from 
the 
trees; 
they 
are 
good 
and 
sweet; 
and, 
as 


they 
fall, 
their 
red 
skin 
bursts. 
I 
am 
a 
north 
wind 
to 
ripe 
figs. 


Thus, 
like 
figs, 
these 
teachings 
fall 
to 
you, 
my 
friends: 
now 
consume 


their 
juice 
and 
their 
sweet 
meat. 
It 
is 
fall 
around 
us, 
and 
pure 
sky 
and 


afternoon.5 


It 
is 
no 
fanatic 
that 
speaks 
here; 
this 
is 
not 
“preaching”; 
no 
faith 
is 
demanded 
here: 
from 
an 
infinite 
abundance 
of 
light 
and 
depth 
of 
happiness 
falls 
drop 
upon 
drop, 
word 
upon 
word: 
the 
tempo 
of 
these 
speeches 
is 
a 
tender 
adagio. 
Such 
things 
reach 
only 
the 
most 
select. 
It 
is 
a 
privilege 
without 
equal 
to 
be 
a 
listener 
here. 
Nobody 
is 
free 
to 
have 
ears 
for 
Zarathustra. 


Is 
not 
Zarathustra 
in 
view 
of 
all 
this 
a 
seducer?— 
But 
what 
does 
he 
himself 
say, 
as 
he 
returns 
again 
for 
the 
first 
time 
to 
his 
solitude? 
Precisely 
the 
opposite 
of 
everything 
that 
any 
“sage,” 
“saint,” 
“world-redeemer,” 
or 
any 
other 
decadent 
would 
say 
in 
such 
a 
case.— 
Not 
only 
does 
he 
speak 
differently, 
he 
also 
is 
different.— 


Now 
I 
go 
alone, 
my 
disciples, 
You, 
too, 
go 
now, 
alone. 
Thus 
I 
want 
it. 



Go 
away 
from 
me 
and 
resist 
Zarathustra! 
And 
even 
better: 
be 
ashamed 
of 
him! 
Perhaps 
he 
deceived 
you. 
The 
man 
of 
knowledge 
must 
not 
only 
love 
his 
enemies, 
he 
must 
also 
be 
able 
to 
hate 
his 
friends. 
One 
repays 
a 
teacher 
badly 
if 
one 
always 
remains 
nothing 
but 
a 
pupil. 
And 
why 
do 
you 
not 
want 
to 
pluck 
at 
my 
wreath? 
You 
revere 
me; 
but 
what 
if 
your 
reverence 
tumbles 
one 
day? 
Beware 
lest 
a 
statue 
slay 
you. 
You 
say 
that 
you 
believe 
in 
Zarathustra? 
But 
what 
matters 
Zarathustra? 
You 
are 
my 
believers—but 
what 
matter 
all 
believers? 
You 
had 
not 
yet 
sought 
yourselves; 
and 
you 
found 
me. 
Thus 
do 
all 
believers; 
therefore 
all 
faith 
amounts 
to 
so 
little. 
Now 
I 
bid 
you 
lose 
me 
and 
find 
yourselves; 
and 
only 
when 
you 
have 
all 
denied 
me 
will 
I 
return 
to 
you.6

On

when 
everything 
is 
ripening 
and 
not 
only 
the 
grape 
turns 
brown, 
the

I

looked

never

so 
many 
and 
such 
good 
things 
at

It 
was 
not 
for 
nothing 
that 
I 
buried 
my 
forty-fourth

I 
had 
the

is

Why 
I 
Am 
So 
Wise 



1 


The 
good 
fortune 
of 
my 
existence, 
its 
uniqueness 
perhaps, 
lies 
in 
its 
fatality: 
I 
am, 
to 
express 
it 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
riddle, 
already 
dead 
as 
my 
father, 
while 
as 
my 
mother 
I 
am 
still 
living 
and 
becoming 
old. 
This 
dual 
descent, 
as 
it 
were, 
both 
from 
the 
highest 
and 
the 
lowest 
rung 
on 
the 
ladder 
of 
life, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
decadent 
and 
a 
beginning—this, 
if 
anything, 
explains 
that 
neutrality, 
that 
freedom 
from 
all 
partiality 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
total 
problem 
of 
life, 
that 
perhaps 
distinguishes 
me. 
I 
have 
a 
subtler 
sense 
of 
smell 
for 
the 
signs 
of 
ascent 
and 
decline 
than 
any 
other 
human 
being 
before 
me; 
I 
am 
the 
teacher 
par 
excellence 
for 
this—I 
know 
both, 
I 
am 
both. 


My 
father 
died 
at 
the 
age 
of 
thirty-six: 
he 
was 
delicate, 
kind, 
and 
morbid, 
as 
a 
being 
that 
is 
destined 
merely 
to 
pass 
by—more 
a 
gracious 
memory 
of 
life 
than 
life 
itself. 
In 
the 
same 
year 
in 
which 
his 
life 
went 
downward, 
mine, 
too, 
went 
downward: 
at 
thirty-six, 
I 
reached 
the 
lowest 
point 
of 
my 
vitality—I 
still 
lived, 
but 
without 
being 
able 
to 
see 
three 
steps 
ahead. 
Then—it 
was 
1879—I 
retired 
from 
my 
professorship 
at 
Basel, 
spent 
the 
summer 
in 
St. 
Moritz 
like 
a 
shadow, 
and 
the 
next 
winter, 
than 
which 
not 
one 
in 
my 
life 
has 
been 
poorer 
in 
sunshine, 
in 
Naumburg 
as 
a 
shadow. 
This 
was 
my 
minimum: 
the 
Wanderer 
and 
His 
Shadow 
originated 
at 
this 
time. 
Doubtless, 
I 
then 
knew 
about 
shadows. 


The 
following 
winter, 
my 
first 
one 
in 
Genoa, 
that 
sweetening 
and 
spiritualization 
which 
is 
almost 
inseparably 
connected 
with 
an 
extreme 
poverty 
of 
blood 
and 
muscle, 
produced 
The 
Dawn. 
The 
perfect 
brightness 
and 
cheerfulness, 
even 
exuberance 
of 
the 
spirit, 
reflected 
in 
this 
work, 
is 
compatible 
in 
my 
case 
not 
only 
with 
the 
most 
profound 
physiological 
weakness, 
but 
even 
with 
an 
excess 
of 
pain. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
torments 
that 
go 
with 
an 
uninterrupted 
three-day 
migraine, 
accompanied 
by 
laborious 
vomiting 
of 
phlegm, 
I 
possessed 
a 
dialectician’s 
clarity 
par 
excellence 
and 
thought 
through 
with 
very 
cold 
blood 
matters 
for 
which 
under 
healthier 
circumstances 
I 
am 
not 
mountain-climber, 
not 
subtle, 
not 
cold 
enough. 
My 
readers 
know 
perhaps 
in 
what 
way 
I 
consider 
dialectic 
as 
a 
symptom 
of 
decadence; 
for 
example 
in 
the 
most 
famous 
case, 
the 
case 
of 
Socrates. 



All 
pathological 
disturbances 
of 
the 
intellect, 
even 
that 
half-numb 
state 
that 
follows 
fever, 
have 
remained 
entirely 
foreign 
to 
me 
to 
this 
day; 
and 
I 
had 
to 
do 
research 
to 
find 
out 
about 
their 
nature 
and 
frequency. 
My 
blood 
moves 
slowly. 
Nobody 
has 
ever 
discovered 
any 
fever 
in 
me. 
A 
physician 
who 
treated 
me 
for 
some 
time 
as 
if 
my 
nerves 
were 
sick 
finally 
said: 
“It’s 
not 
your 
nerves, 
it 
is 
rather 
I 
that 
am 
nervous.” 
There 
is 
altogether 
no 
sign 
of 
any 
local 
degeneration; 
no 
organically 
conditioned 
stomach 
complaint, 
however 
profound 
the 
weakness 
of 
my 
gastric 
system 
may 
be 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
over-all 
exhaustion. 
My 
eye 
trouble, 
too, 
though 
at 
times 
dangerously 
close 
to 
blindness, 
is 
only 
a 
consequence 
and 
not 
a 
cause: 
with 
every 
increase 
in 
vitality 
my 
ability 
to 
see 
has 
also 
increased 
again. 


A 
long, 
all 
too 
long, 
series 
of 
years 
signifies 
recovery 
for 
me; 
unfortunately 
it 
also 
signifies 
relapse, 
decay, 
the 
periodicity 
of 
a 
kind 
of 
decadence. 
Need 
I 
say 
after 
all 
this 
that 
in 
questions 
of 
decadence 
I 
am 
experienced? 
I 
have 
spelled 
them 
forward 
and 
backward. 
Even 
that 
filigree 
art 
of 
grasping 
and 
comprehending 
in 
general, 
those 
fingers 
for 
nuances, 
that 
psychology 
of 
“looking 
around 
the 
corner,” 
and 
whatever 
else 
is 
characteristic 
of 
me, 
was 
learned 
only 
then, 
is 
the 
true 
present 
of 
those 
days 
in 
which 
everything 
in 
me 
became 
subtler—observation 
itself 
as 
well 
as 
all 
organs 
of 
observation. 
Looking 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
sick 
toward 
healthier 
concepts 
and 
values 
and, 
conversely, 
looking 
again 
from 
the 
fullness 
and 
self-assurance 
of 
a 
rich 
life 
down 
into 
the 
secret 
work 
of 
the 
instinct 
of 
decadence—in 
this 
I 
have 
had 
the 
longest 
training, 
my 
truest 
experience; 
if 
in 
anything, 
I 
became 
master 
in 
this. 
Now 
I 
know 
how, 
have 
the 
know-how, 
to 
reverse 
perspectives: 
the 
first 
reason 
why 
a 
“revaluation 
of 
values” 
is 
perhaps 
possible 
for 
me 
alone. 



2 


Apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
am 
a 
decadent, 
I 
am 
also 
the 
opposite. 
My 
proof 
for 
this 
is, 
among 
other 
things, 
that 
I 
have 
always 
instinctively 
chosen 
the 
right 
means 
against 
wretched 
states; 
while 
the 
decadent 
typically 
chooses 
means 
that 
are 
disadvantageous 
for 
him. 
As 
summa 
summarum,1 
I 
was 
healthy; 
as 
an 
angle, 
as 
a 
specialty, 
I 
was 
a 
decadent. 
The 
energy 
to 
choose 
absolute 
solitude 
and 
leave 
the 
life 
to 
which 
I 
had 
become 
accustomed; 
the 
insistence 
on 
not 
allowing 
myself 
any 
longer 
to 
be 
cared 
for, 
waited 
on, 
and 
doctored—that 
betrayed 
an 
absolute 
instinctive 
certainty 
about 
what 
was 
needed 
above 
all 
at 
that 
time. 
I 
took 
myself 
in 
hand, 
I 
made 
myself 
healthy 
again: 
the 
condition 
for 
this—every 
physiologist 
would 
admit 
that—is 
that 
one 
be 
healthy 
at 
bottom. 
A 
typically 
morbid 
being 
cannot 
become 
healthy, 
much 
less 
make 
itself 
healthy. 
For 
a 
typically 
healthy 
person, 
conversely, 
being 
sick 
can 
even 
become 
an 
energetic 
stimulus 
for 
life, 
for 
living 
more. 
This, 
in 
fact, 
is 
how 
that 
long 
period 
of 
sickness 
appears 
to 
me 
now: 
as 
it 
were, 
I 
discovered 
life 
anew, 
including 
myself; 
I 
tasted 
all 
good 
and 
even 
little 
things, 
as 
others 
cannot 
easily 
taste 
them—I 
turned 
my 
will 
to 
health, 
to 
life, 
into 
a 
philosophy. 


For 
it 
should 
be 
noted: 
it 
was 
during 
the 
years 
of 
my 
lowest 
vitality 
that 
I 
ceased 
to 
be 
a 
pessimist; 
the 
instinct 
of 
self-restoration 
forbade 
me 
a 
philosophy 
of 
poverty 
and 
discouragement. 


What 
is 
it, 
fundamentally, 
that 
allows 
us 
to 
recognize 
who 
has 
turned 
out 
well? 
That 
a 
well-turned-out 
person 
pleases 
our 
senses, 
that 
he 
is 
carved 
from 
wood 
that 
is 
hard, 
delicate, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
smells 
good. 
He 
has 
a 
taste 
only 
for 
what 
is 
good 
for 
him; 
his 
pleasure, 
his 
delight 
cease 
where 
the 
measure 
of 
what 
is 
good 
for 
him 
is 
transgressed. 
He 
guesses 
what 
remedies 
avail 
against 
what 
is 
harmful; 
he 
exploits 
bad 
accidents 
to 
his 
advantage; 
what 
does 
not 
kill 
him 
makes 
him 
stronger.2 
Instinctively, 
he 
collects 
from 
everything 
he 
sees, 
hears, 
lives 
through, 
his 
sum: 
he 
is 
a 
principle 
of 
selection, 
he 
discards 
much. 
He 
is 
always 
in 
his 
own 
company, 
whether 
he 
associates 
with 
books, 
human 
beings, 
or 
landscapes: 
he 
honors 
by 
choosing, 
by 
admitting, 
by 
trusting. 
He 
reacts 
slowly 
to 
all 
kinds 
of 
stimuli, 
with 
that 



slowness 
which 
long 
caution 
and 
deliberate 
pride 
have 
bred 
in 
him: 
he 
examines 
the 
stimulus 
that 
approaches 
him, 
he 
is 
far 
from 
meeting 
it 
halfway. 
He 
believes 
neither 
in 
“misfortune” 
nor 
in 
“guilt”: 
he 
comes 
to 
terms 
with 
himself, 
with 
others; 
he 
knows 
how 
to 
forget—he 
is 
strong 
enough; 
hence 
everything 
must 
turn 
out 
for 
his 
best. 


Well 
then, 
I 
am 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
decadent, 
for 
I 
have 
just 
described 
myself. 



3 


This 
dual 
series 
of 
experiences, 
this 
access 
to 
apparently 
separate 
worlds, 
is 
repeated 
in 
my 
nature 
in 
every 
respect: 
I 
am 
a 
Doppelgänger, 
I 
have 
a 
“second” 
face 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
first. 
And 
perhaps 
also 
a 
third. 


Even 
by 
virtue 
of 
my 
descent, 
I 
am 
granted 
an 
eye 
beyond 
all 
merely 
local, 
merely 
nationally 
conditioned 
perspectives; 
it 
is 
not 
difficult 
for 
me 
to 
be 
a 
“good 
European.” 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
I 
am 
perhaps 
more 
German 
than 
present-day 
Germans, 
mere 
citizens 
of 
the 
German 
Reich, 
could 
possibly 
be 
—I, 
the 
last 
anti-political 
German. 
And 
yet 
my 
ancestors 
were 
Polish 
noblemen: 
I 
have 
many 
racial 
instincts 
in 
my 
body 
from 
that 
source—who 
knows? 
In 
the 
end 
perhaps 
even 
the 
liberum 
veto.1 


When 
I 
consider 
how 
often 
I 
am 
addressed 
as 
a 
Pole 
when 
I 
travel, 
even 
by 
Poles 
themselves, 
and 
how 
rarely 
I 
am 
taken 
for 
a 
German, 
it 
might 
seem 
that 
I 
have 
been 
merely 
externally 
sprinkled 
with 
what 
is 
German. 
Yet 
my 
mother, 
Franziska 
Oehler, 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
something 
very 
German; 
ditto, 
my 
grandmother 
on 
my 
father’s 
side, 
Erdmuthe 
Krause. 
The 
latter 
lived 
all 
her 
youth 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
good 
old 
Weimar, 
not 
without 
some 
connection 
with 
the 
circle 
of 
Goethe. 
Her 
brother, 
the 
professor 
of 
theology 
Krause 
in 
Königsberg, 
was 
called 
to 
Weimar 
as 
general 
superintendent 
after 
Herder’s 
death. 
It 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
her 
mother, 
my 
great-grandmother, 
is 
mentioned 
in 
the 
diary 
of 
the 
young 
Goethe 
under 
the 
name 
of 
“Muthgen.” 
Her 
second 
marriage 
was 
with 
the 
superintendent 
Nietzsche 
in 
Eilenburg; 
and 
in 
the 
great 
war 
year 
of 
1813, 
on 
the 
day 
that 
Napoleon 
entered 
Eilenburg 
with 
his 
general 
staff, 
on 
the 
tenth 
of 
October, 
she 
gave 
birth. 
As 
a 
Saxon, 
she 
was 
a 
great 
admirer 
of 
Napoleon; 
it 
could 
be 
that 
I 
still 
am, 
too. 
My 
father, 
born 
in 
1813, 
died 
in 
1849. 
Before 
he 
accepted 
the 
pastor’s 
position 
in 
the 
parish 
of 
Röcken, 
not 
far 
from 
Lützen, 
he 
lived 
for 
a 
few 
years 
in 
the 
castle 
of 
Altenburg 
and 
taught 
the 
four 
princesses 
there. 
His 
pupils 
are 
now 
the 
Queen 
of 
Hanover, 
the 
Grand 
Duchess 
Constantine, 
the 
Grand 
Duchess 
of 
Altenburg, 
and 
the 
Princess 
Therese 
of 
Saxe-Altenburg. 
He 
was 
full 
of 
deep 
reverence 
for 
the 
Prussian 
king 
Frederick 
William 
IV, 
from 
whom 
he 
had 
also 
received 
his 
pastoral 
position; 
the 
events 
of 
1848 
grieved 
him 
beyond 
all 



measure. 
I 
myself, 
born 
on 
the 
birthday 
of 
the 
above 
named 
king, 
on 
the 
fifteenth 
of 
October, 
received, 
as 
fitting, 
the 
Hohenzollern 
name 
Friedrich 
Wilhelm. 
There 
was 
at 
least 
one 
advantage 
to 
the 
choice 
of 
this 
day; 
my 
birthday 
was 
a 
holiday 
throughout 
my 
childhood. 


I 
consider 
it 
a 
great 
privilege 
to 
have 
had 
such 
a 
father: 
it 
even 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
explains 
whatever 
else 
I 
have 
of 
privileges—not 
including 
life, 
the 
great 
Yes 
to 
life. 
Above 
all, 
that 
it 
requires 
no 
resolve 
on 
my 
part, 
but 
merely 
biding 
my 
time, 
to 
enter 
quite 
involuntarily 
into 
a 
world 
of 
lofty 
and 
delicate 
things: 
I 
am 
at 
home 
there, 
my 
inmost 
passion 
becomes 
free 
only 
there. 
That 
I 
have 
almost 
paid 
with 
my 
life 
for 
this 
privilege 
is 
certainly 
no 
unfair 
trade. 


In 
order 
to 
understand 
anything 
at 
all 
of 
my 
Zarathustra 
one 
must 
perhaps 
be 
similarly 
conditioned 
as 
I 
am—with 
one 
foot 
beyond 
life. 



4 


I 
have 
never 
understood 
the 
art 
of 
predisposing 
people 
against 
me—this, 
too, 
I 
owe 
to 
my 
incomparable 
father—even 
when 
it 
seemed 
highly 
desirable 
to 
me. 
However 
un-Christian 
this 
may 
seem, 
I 
am 
not 
even 
predisposed 
against 
myself. 
You 
can 
turn 
my 
life 
this 
way 
and 
that, 
you 
will 
rarely 
find 
traces, 
and 
actually 
only 
once, 
that 
anybody 
felt 
ill 
will 
toward 
me—but 
perhaps 
rather 
too 
many 
traces 
of 
good 
will. 


Even 
my 
experiences 
with 
people 
with 
whom 
everybody 
has 
bad 
experiences 
bear 
witness, 
without 
exception, 
in 
their 
favor: 
I 
tame 
every 
bear, 
I 
make 
even 
buffoons 
behave 
themselves. 
During 
the 
seven 
years 
that 
I 
taught 
Greek 
in 
the 
senior 
class 
in 
the 
Pädagogium 
in 
Basel, 
I 
never 
had 
occasion 
to 
punish 
anyone; 
the 
laziest 
boys 
worked 
hard. 
I 
am 
always 
equal 
to 
accidents; 
I 
have 
to 
be 
unprepared 
to 
be 
master 
of 
myself. 
Let 
the 
instrument 
be 
what 
it 
may, 
let 
it 
be 
as 
out 
of 
tune 
as 
only 
the 
instrument 
“man” 
can 
be—I 
should 
have 
to 
be 
sick 
if 
I 
should 
not 
succeed 
in 
getting 
out 
of 
it 
something 
worth 
hearing. 
And 
how 
often 
have 
I 
been 
told 
by 
the 
“instruments” 
themselves 
that 
they 
had 
never 
heard 
themselves 
like 
that.— 
Most 
beautifully 
perhaps 
by 
Heinrich 
von 
Stein,1 
who 
died 
so 
unpardonably 
young. 
Once, 
after 
he 
had 
courteously 
requested 
permission, 
he 
appeared 
for 
three 
days 
in 
Sils 
Maria, 
explaining 
to 
everybody 
that 
he 
had 
not 
come 
to 
see 
the 
Engadine. 
This 
excellent 
human 
being, 
who 
had 
walked 
into 
the 
Wagnerian 
morass 
with 
all 
the 
impetuous 
simplicity 
of 
a 
Prussian 
Junker 
(and 
in 
addition 
even 
into 
that 
of 
Dühring!2), 
acted 
during 
these 
three 
days 
like 
one 
transformed 
by 
a 
tempest 
of 
freedom, 
like 
one 
who 
has 
suddenly 
been 
lifted 
to 
his 
own 
height 
and 
acquired 
wings. 
I 
always 
said 
to 
him 
that 
this 
was 
due 
to 
the 
good 
air 
up 
here, 
that 
this 
happened 
to 
everybody, 
that 
one 
was 
not 
for 
nothing 
six 
thousand 
feet 
above 
Bayreuth3—but 
he 
would 
not 
believe 
me. 


If, 
in 
spite 
of 
that, 
some 
small 
and 
great 
misdemeanors 
have 
been 
committed 
against 
me, 
“the 
will” 
cannot 
be 
blamed 
for 
this, 
least 
of 
all 
any 
ill 
will: 
sooner 
could 
I 
complain, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
suggested, 
of 
the 
good 
will 
that 
has 
done 
no 
small 
mischief 
in 
my 
life. 
My 
experiences 
entitle 
me 
to 
be 



quite 
generally 
suspicious 
of 
the 
so-called 
“selfless” 
drives, 
of 
all 
“neighbor 
love” 
that 
is 
ready 
to 
give 
advice 
and 
go 
into 
action. 
It 
always 
seems 
a 
weakness 
to 
me, 
a 
particular 
case 
of 
being 
incapable 
of 
resisting 
stimuli: 
pity 
is 
considered 
a 
virtue 
only 
among 
decadents. 
I 
reproach 
those 
who 
are 
full 
of 
pity 
for 
easily 
losing 
a 
sense 
of 
shame, 
of 
respect, 
of 
sensitivity 
for 
distances; 
before 
you 
know 
it, 
pity 
begins 
to 
smell 
of 
the 
mob 
and 
becomes 
scarcely 
distinguishable 
from 
bad 
manners—and 
sometimes 
pitying 
hands 
can 
interfere 
in 
a 
downright 
destructive 
manner 
in 
a 
great 
destiny, 
in 
the 
growing 
solitude 
of 
one 
wounded, 
in 
a 
privileged 
right 
to 
heavy 
guilt. 


The 
overcoming 
of 
pity 
I 
count 
among 
the 
noble 
virtues: 
as 
“Zarathustra’s 
temptation” 
I 
invented 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
a 
great 
cry 
of 
distress 
reaches 
him, 
as 
pity 
tries 
to 
attack 
him 
like 
a 
final 
sin 
that 
would 
entice 
him 
away 
from 
himself.4 
To 
remain 
the 
master 
at 
this 
point, 
to 
keep 
the 
eminence 
of 
one’s 
task 
undefiled 
by 
the 
many 
lower 
and 
more 
myopic 
impulses 
that 
are 
at 
work 
in 
so-called 
selfless 
actions, 
that 
is 
the 
test, 
perhaps 
the 
ultimate 
test, 
which 
a 
Zarathustra 
must 
pass—his 
real 
proof 
of 
strength. 



5 


At 
another 
point 
as 
well, 
I 
am 
merely 
my 
father 
once 
more 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
his 
continued 
life 
after 
an 
all-too-early 
death. 
Like 
everyone 
who 
has 
never 
lived 
among 
his 
equals 
and 
who 
finds 
the 
concept 
of 
“retaliation” 
as 
inaccessible 
as, 
say, 
the 
concept 
of 
“equal 
rights,” 
I 
forbid 
myself 
all 
countermeasures, 
all 
protective 
measures, 
and, 
as 
is 
only 
fair, 
also 
any 
defense, 
any 
“justification,” 
in 
cases 
when 
some 
small 
or 
very 
great 
folly 
is 
perpetrated 
against 
me. 
My 
kind 
of 
retaliation 
consists 
in 
following 
up 
the 
stupidity 
as 
fast 
as 
possible 
with 
some 
good 
sense: 
that 
way 
one 
may 
actually 
catch 
up 
with 
it.1 
Metaphorically 
speaking, 
I 
send 
a 
box 
of 
confections 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
a 
painful 
story. 


One 
needs 
only 
to 
do 
me 
some 
wrong, 
I 
“repay” 
it—you 
may 
be 
sure 
of 
that: 
soon 
I 
find 
an 
opportunity 
for 
expressing 
my 
gratitude 
to 
the 
“evil-doer” 
(at 
times 
even 
for 
his 
evil 
deed)—or 
to 
ask 
him 
for 
something, 
which 
can 
be 
more 
obliging 
than 
giving 
something. 


It 
also 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
rudest 
word, 
the 
rudest 
letter 
are 
still 
more 
benign, 
more 
decent 
than 
silence. 
Those 
who 
remain 
silent 
are 
almost 
always 
lacking 
in 
delicacy 
and 
courtesy 
of 
the 
heart. 
Silence 
is 
an 
objection; 
swallowing 
things 
leads 
of 
necessity 
to 
a 
bad 
character—it 
even 
upsets 
the 
stomach. 
All 
who 
remain 
silent 
are 
dyspeptic. 


You 
see, 
I 
don’t 
want 
rudeness 
to 
be 
underestimated: 
it 
is 
by 
far 
the 
most 
humane 
form 
of 
contradiction 
and, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
effeminacy, 
one 
of 
our 
foremost 
virtues. 


If 
one 
is 
rich 
enough 
for 
this, 
it 
is 
even 
a 
good 
fortune 
to 
be 
in 
the 
wrong. 
A 
god 
who 
would 
come 
to 
earth 
must 
not 
do 
anything 
except 
wrong: 
not 
to 
take 
the 
punishment 
upon 
oneself 
but 
the 
guilt 
would 
be 
divine.2 



6 


Freedom 
from 
ressentiment, 
enlightenment 
about 
ressentiment—who 
knows 
how 
much 
I 
am 
ultimately 
indebted, 
in 
this 
respect 
also, 
to 
my 
protracted 
sickness! 
This 
problem 
is 
far 
from 
simple: 
one 
must 
have 
experienced 
it 
from 
strength 
as 
well 
as 
from 
weakness. 
If 
anything 
at 
all 
must 
be 
adduced 
against 
being 
sick 
and 
being 
weak, 
it 
is 
that 
man’s 
really 
remedial 
instinct, 
his 
fighting 
instinct1 
wears 
out. 
One 
cannot 
get 
rid 
of 
anything, 
one 
cannot 
get 
over 
anything, 
one 
cannot 
repel 
anything—everything 
hurts. 
Men 
and 
things 
obtrude 
too 
closely; 
experiences 
strike 
one 
too 
deeply; 
memory 
becomes 
a 
festering 
wound. 
Sickness 
itself 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
ressentiment. 


Against 
all 
this 
the 
sick 
person 
has 
only 
one 
great 
remedy: 
I 
call 
it 
Russian 
fatalism, 
that 
fatalism 
without 
revolt 
which 
is 
exemplified 
by 
a 
Russian 
soldier 
who, 
finding 
a 
campaign 
too 
strenuous, 
finally 
lies 
down 
in 
the 
snow. 
No 
longer 
to 
accept 
anything 
at 
all, 
no 
longer 
to 
take 
anything, 
no 
longer 
to 
absorb 
anything—to 
cease 
reacting 
altogether. 


This 
fatalism 
is 
not 
always 
merely 
the 
courage 
to 
die; 
it 
can 
also 
preserve 
life 
under 
the 
most 
perilous 
conditions 
by 
reducing 
the 
metabolism, 
slowing 
it 
down, 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
will 
to 
hibernate. 
Carrying 
this 
logic 
a 
few 
steps 
further, 
we 
arrive 
at 
the 
fakir 
who 
sleeps 
for 
weeks 
in 
a 
grave. 


Because 
one 
would 
use 
oneself 
up 
too 
quickly 
if 
one 
reacted 
in 
any 
way, 
one 
does 
not 
react 
at 
all 
any 
more: 
this 
is 
the 
logic. 
Nothing 
burns 
one 
up 
faster 
than 
the 
affects 
of 
ressentiment. 
Anger, 
pathological 
vulnerability, 
impotent 
lust 
for 
revenge, 
thirst 
for 
revenge, 
poison-mixing 
in 
any 
sense—no 
reaction 
could 
be 
more 
disadvantageous 
for 
the 
exhausted: 
such 
affects 
involve 
a 
rapid 
consumption 
of 
nervous 
energy, 
a 
pathological 
increase 
of 
harmful 
excretions—for 
example, 
of 
the 
gall 
bladder 
into 
the 
stomach. 
Ressentiment 
is 
what 
is 
forbidden 
par 
excellence 
for 
the 
sick—it 
is 
their 
specific 
evil—unfortunately 
also 
their 
most 
natural 
inclination. 


This 
was 
comprehended 
by 
that 
profound 
physiologist, 
the 
Buddha. 
His 
“religion” 
should 
rather 
be 
called 
a 
kind 
of 
hygiene, 
lest 
it 
be 
confused 
with 
such 
pitiable 
phenomena 
as 
Christianity: 
its 
effectiveness 
was 
made 
conditional 
on 
the 
victory 
over 
ressentiment. 
To 
liberate 
the 
soul 
from 
this 
is 



the 
first 
step 
toward 
recovery. 
“Not 
by 
enmity 
is 
enmity 
ended; 
by 
friendliness 
enmity 
is 
ended”: 
these 
words 
stand 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Buddha.2 
It 
is 
not 
morality 
that 
speaks 
thus; 
thus 
speaks 
physiology. 


Born 
of 
weakness, 
ressentiment 
is 
most 
harmful 
for 
the 
weak 
themselves. 
Conversely, 
given 
a 
rich 
nature, 
it 
is 
a 
superfluous 
feeling; 
mastering 
this 
feeling 
is 
virtually 
what 
proves 
riches. 
Whoever 
knows 
how 
seriously 
my 
philosophy 
has 
pursued 
the 
fight 
against 
vengefulness 
and 
rancor, 
even 
into 
the 
doctrine 
of 
“free 
will”3— 
the 
fight 
against 
Christianity 
is 
merely 
a 
special 
case 
of 
this—will 
understand 
why 
I 
am 
making 
such 
a 
point 
of 
my 
own 
behavior, 
my 
instinctive 
sureness 
in 
practice. 
During 
periods 
of 
decadence 
I 
forbade 
myself 
such 
feelings 
as 
harmful; 
as 
soon 
as 
my 
vitality 
was 
rich 
and 
proud 
enough 
again, 
I 
forbade 
myself 
such 
feelings 
as 
beneath 
me. 
I 
displayed 
the 
“Russian 
fatalism” 
I 
mentioned 
by 
tenaciously 
clinging 
for 
years 
to 
all 
but 
intolerable 
situations, 
places, 
apartments, 
and 
society, 
merely 
because 
they 
happened 
to 
be 
given 
by 
accident: 
it 
was 
better 
than 
changing 
them, 
than 
feeling 
that 
they 
could 
be 
changed—than 
rebelling 
against 
them. 


Any 
attempt 
to 
disturb 
me 
in 
this 
fatalism, 
to 
awaken 
me 
by 
force, 
used 
to 
annoy 
me 
mortally—and 
it 
actually 
was 
mortally 
dangerous 
every 
time. 


Accepting 
oneself 
as 
if 
fated, 
not 
wishing 
oneself 
“different”—that 
is 
in 
such 
cases 
great 
reason 
itself. 



7 


War1 
is 
another 
matter. 
I 
am 
warlike 
by 
nature. 
Attacking 
is 
one 
of 
my 
instincts. 
Being 
able 
to 
be 
an 
enemy, 
being 
an 
enemy—perhaps 
that 
presupposes 
a 
strong 
nature; 
in 
any 
case, 
it 
belongs 
to 
every 
strong 
nature. 
It 
needs 
objects 
of 
resistance; 
hence 
it 
looks 
for 
what 
resists: 
the 
aggressive 
pathos 
belongs 
just 
as 
necessarily 
to 
strength 
as 
vengefulness 
and 
rancor 
belong 
to 
weakness. 
Woman, 
for 
example, 
is 
vengeful: 
that 
is 
due 
to 
her 
weakness, 
as 
much 
as 
is 
her 
susceptibility 
to 
the 
distress 
of 
others. 


The 
strength 
of 
those 
who 
attack 
can 
be 
measured 
in 
a 
way 
by 
the 
opposition 
they 
require: 
every 
growth 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
search 
for 
a 
mighty 
opponent—or 
problem; 
for 
a 
warlike 
philosopher 
challenges 
problems, 
too, 
to 
single 
combat. 
The 
task 
is 
not 
simply 
to 
master 
what 
happens 
to 
resist, 
but 
what 
requires 
us 
to 
stake 
all 
our 
strength, 
suppleness, 
and 
fighting 
skill— 
opponents 
that 
are 
our 
equals. 


Equality 
before 
the 
enemy: 
the 
first 
presupposition 
of 
an 
honest 
duel. 
Where 
one 
feels 
contempt, 
one 
cannot 
wage 
war; 
where 
one 
commands, 
where 
one 
sees 
something 
beneath 
oneself, 
one 
has 
no 
business 
waging 
war. 


My 
practice 
of 
war 
can 
be 
summed 
up 
in 
four 
propositions. 
First: 
I 
only 
attack 
causes 
that 
are 
victorious; 
I 
may 
even 
wait 
until 
they 
become 
victorious.2 


Second: 
I 
only 
attack 
causes 
against 
which 
I 
would 
not 
find 
allies, 
so 
that 
I 
stand 
alone—so 
that 
I 
compromise 
myself 
alone.—I 
have 
never 
taken 
a 
step 
publicly 
that 
did 
not 
compromise 
me: 
that 
is 
my 
criterion 
of 
doing 
right. 


Third: 
I 
never 
attack 
persons; 
I 
merely 
avail 
myself 
of 
the 
person 
as 
of 
a 
strong 
magnifying 
glass 
that 
allows 
one 
to 
make 
visible 
a 
general 
but 
creeping 
and 
elusive 
calamity. 
Thus 
I 
attacked 
David 
Strauss—more 
precisely, 
the 
success 
of 
a 
senile 
book 
with 
the 
“cultured” 
people 
in 
Germany: 
I 
caught 
this 
culture 
in 
the 
act. 


Thus 
I 
attacked 
Wagner—more 
precisely, 
the 
falseness, 
the 
half-couth 
instincts 
of 
our 
“culture” 
which 
mistakes 
the 
subtle 
for 
the 
rich, 
and 
the 
late 
for 
the 
great. 


Fourth: 
I 
only 
attack 
things 
when 
every 
personal 
quarrel 
is 
excluded, 
when 



any 
background 
of 
bad 
experiences 
is 
lacking. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
attack 
is 
in 
my 
case 
a 
proof 
of 
good 
will, 
sometimes 
even 
of 
gratitude. 
I 
honor, 
I 
distinguish 
by 
associating 
my 
name 
with 
that 
of 
a 
cause 
or 
a 
person: 
pro 
or 
con—that 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
me 
at 
this 
point. 
When 
I 
wage 
war 
against 
Christianity 
I 
am 
entitled 
to 
this 
because 
I 
have 
never 
experienced 
misfortunes 
and 
frustrations 
from 
that 
quarter—the 
most 
serious 
Christians 
have 
always 
been 
well 
disposed 
toward 
me. 
I 
myself, 
an 
opponent 
of 
Christianity 
de 
rigueur,3 
am 
far 
from 
blaming 
individuals 
for 
the 
calamity 
of 
millennia. 



8 


May 
I 
still 
venture 
to 
sketch 
one 
final 
trait 
of 
my 
nature 
that 
causes 
me 
no 
little 
difficulties 
in 
my 
contacts 
with 
other 
men? 
My 
instinct 
for 
cleanliness 
is 
characterized 
by 
a 
perfectly 
uncanny 
sensitivity 
so 
that 
the 
proximity 
or— 
what 
am 
I 
saying?—the 
inmost 
parts, 
the 
“entrails” 
of 
every 
soul 
are 
physiologically 
perceived 
by 
me—smelled. 


This 
sensitivity 
furnishes 
me 
with 
psychological 
antennae 
with 
which 
I 
feel 
and 
get 
a 
hold 
of 
every 
secret: 
the 
abundant 
hidden 
dirt 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
many 
a 
character—perhaps 
the 
result 
of 
bad 
blood, 
but 
glossed 
over 
by 
education—enters 
my 
consciousness 
almost 
at 
the 
first 
contact. 
If 
my 
observation 
has 
not 
deceived 
me, 
such 
characters 
who 
offend 
my 
sense 
of 
cleanliness 
also 
sense 
from 
their 
side 
the 
reserve 
of 
my 
disgust—and 
this 
does 
not 
make 
them 
smell 
any 
better. 


As 
has 
always 
been 
my 
wont—extreme 
cleanliness 
in 
relation 
to 
me 
is 
the 
presupposition 
of 
my 
existence; 
I 
perish 
under 
unclean 
conditions—I 
constantly 
swim 
and 
bathe 
and 
splash, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
water—in 
some 
perfectly 
transparent 
and 
resplendent 
element. 
Hence 
association 
with 
people 
imposes 
no 
mean 
test 
on 
my 
patience: 
my 
humanity 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
feeling 
with 
men 
how 
they 
are, 
but 
in 
enduring 
that 
I 
feel 
with 
them.1 


My 
humanity 
is 
a 
constant 
self-overcoming. 


But 
I 
need 
solitude—which 
is 
to 
say, 
recovery, 
return 
to 
myself, 
the 
breath 
of 
a 
free, 
light, 
playful 
air. 


My 
whole 
Zarathustra 
is 
a 
dithyramb 
on 
solitude 
or, 
if 
I 
have 
been 
understood, 
on 
cleanliness.—Fortunately 
not 
on 
pure 
foolishness.2— 
Those 
who 
have 
eyes 
for 
colors 
will 
compare 
it 
to 
a 
diamond.— 
Nausea 
over 
man, 
over 
the 
“rabble,” 
was 
always 
my 
greatest 
danger.— 
Do 
you 
want 
to 
hear 
the 
words 
in 
which 
Zarathustra 
speaks 
of 
the 
redemption 
from 
nausea? 


What 
was 
it 
that 
happened 
to 
me? 
How 
did 
I 
redeem 
myself 
from 
nausea? 
Who 
rejuvenated 
my 
sight? 
How 
did 
I 
fly 
to 
the 
height 
where 
no 
more 
rabble 
sits 
by 
the 
well? 
Was 
it 
my 
nausea 
itself 
that 
created 
wings 
for 
me 
and 
water-divining 
powers? 
Verily, 
I 
had 
to 
fly 
to 
the 



highest 
spheres 
that 
I 
might 
find 
the 
fount 
of 
pleasure 
again. 


Oh, 
I 
found 
it, 
my 
brothers! 
Here, 
in 
the 
highest 
spheres 
the 
fount 
of 
pleasure 
wells 
up 
for 
me! 
And 
here 
is 
a 
life 
of 
which 
the 
rabble 
does 
not 
drink. 


You 
flow 
for 
me 
almost 
too 
violently, 
fountain 
of 
pleasure. 
And 
often 
you 
empty 
the 
cup 
again 
by 
wanting 
to 
fill 
it. 
And 
I 
must 
still 
learn 
to 
approach 
you 
more 
modestly: 
all 
too 
violently 
my 
heart 
still 
flows 
toward 
you—my 
heart, 
upon 
which 
my 
summer 
burns, 
short, 
hot, 
melancholy, 
overblissful: 
how 
my 
summer 
heart 
craves 
your 
coolness! 


Gone 
is 
the 
hesitant 
gloom 
of 
my 
spring! 
Gone 
the 
snowflakes 
of 
my 
malice 
in 
June!3 
Summer 
have 
I 
become 
entirely, 
and 
summer 
noon! 
A 
summer 
in 
the 
highest 
spheres 
with 
cold 
wells 
and 
blissful 
silence: 
oh, 
come, 
my 
friends, 
that 
the 
silence 
may 
become 
still 
more 
blissful! 


For 
this 
is 
our 
height 
and 
our 
home: 
we 
live 
here 
too 
high 
and 
steep 
for 
all 
the 
unclean 
and 
their 
thirst. 
Cast 
your 
pure 
eyes 
into 
the 
well 
of 
my 
pleasure, 
friends! 
How 
should 
that 
make 
it 
muddy? 
It 
shall 
laugh 
back 
at 
you 
in 
its 
own 
purity. 


On 
the 
tree, 
Future, 
we 
build 
our 
nest; 
and 
in 
our 
solitude 
eagles 
shall 
bring 
us 
nourishment 
in 
their 
beaks. 
Verily, 
no 
nourishment 
that 
the 
unclean 
might 
share: 
they 
would 
think 
they 
were 
devouring 
fire, 
and 
they 
would 
burn 
their 
mouths. 
Verily, 
we 
keep 
no 
homes 
here 
for 
the 
unclean: 
our 
pleasure 
would 
be 
an 
ice 
cave 
to 
their 
bodies 
and 
their 
spirits. 


And 
we 
want 
to 
live 
over 
them 
like 
strong 
winds, 
neighbors 
of 
the 
eagles, 
neighbors 
of 
the 
snow, 
neighbors 
of 
the 
sun: 
thus 
live 
strong 
winds. 
And 
like 
a 
wind 
I 
yet 
want 
to 
blow 
among 
them 
one 
day, 
and 
with 
my 
spirit 
take 
away 
the 
breath 
of 
their 
spirit: 
thus 
my 
future 
wills 
it. 


Verily, 
a 
strong 
wind 
is 
Zarathustra 
for 
all 
who 
are 
low; 
and 
this 
counsel 
I 
give 
to 
all 
his 
enemies 
and 
all 
who 
spit 
and 
spew: 
Beware 
of 
spitting 
against 
the 
wind!

Cf. 
the 
chapter 
“On 
The 
Adder’s 
Bite” 
in 
Zarathustra

“If 
you

enemy, 
do 
not 
requite 
him 
evil 
with 
good, 
for 
that 
would 
put 
him 
to 
shame. 
Rather 
prove 
that 
he 
did 
you 
some 
good. 
And 
rather 
be 
angry 
than 
put 
to 
shame.…”

Cf. 
ibid., 
“Would

tremendous 
success 
of 
David 
Friedrich 
Strauss’ 
book, 
The 
Old 
Faith

he 
broke 
with

after 
Wagner

Why 
I 
Am 
So 
Clever 



1 


Why 
do 
I 
know 
a 
few 
things 
more? 
Why 
am 
I 
altogether 
so 
clever? 
I 
have 
never 
reflected 
on 
questions 
that 
are 
none—I 
have 
not 
wasted 
myself. 


Really 
religious 
difficulties, 
for 
example, 
I 
don’t 
know 
from 
experience. 
It 
has 
escaped 
me 
altogether 
in 
what 
way 
I 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
“sinful.” 
Likewise, 
I 
lack 
any 
reliable 
criterion 
for 
recognizing 
the 
bite 
of 
conscience: 
according 
to 
what 
one 
hears 
about 
it, 
the 
bite 
of 
conscience 
does 
not 
seem 
respectable 
to 
me. 


I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
leave 
an 
action 
in 
the 
lurch 
afterward;1 
I 
should 
prefer 
to 
exclude 
the 
bad 
result, 
the 
consequences, 
from 
the 
question 
of 
value 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle. 
Faced 
with 
a 
bad 
result, 
one 
loses 
all 
too 
easily 
the 
right 
perspective 
for 
what 
one 
has 
done: 
the 
bite 
of 
conscience 
seems 
to 
me 
a 
kind 
of 
“evil 
eye.” 
To 
hold 
in 
honor 
in 
one’s 
heart 
even 
more 
what 
has 
failed, 
because 
it 
failed—that 
would 
go 
better 
with 
my 
morality. 


“God,” 
“immortality 
of 
the 
soul,” 
“redemption,” 
“beyond”— 
without 
exception, 
concepts 
to 
which 
I 
never 
devoted 
any 
attention, 
or 
time; 
not 
even 
as 
a 
child. 
Perhaps 
I 
have 
never 
been 
childlike 
enough 
for 
them? 


I 
do 
not 
by 
any 
means 
know 
atheism 
as 
a 
result; 
even 
less 
as 
an 
event: 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
course 
with 
me, 
from 
instinct. 
I 
am 
too 
inquisitive, 
too 
questionable, 
too 
exuberant 
to 
stand 
for 
any 
gross 
answer.2 
God 
is 
a 
gross 
answer, 
an 
indelicacy 
against 
us 
thinkers—at 
bottom 
merely 
a 
gross 
prohibition 
for 
us: 
you 
shall 
not 
think! 


I 
am 
much 
more 
interested 
in 
a 
question 
on 
which 
the 
“salvation 
of 
humanity” 
depends 
far 
more 
than 
on 
any 
theologians’ 
curio: 
the 
question 
of 
nutrition. 
For 
ordinary 
use, 
one 
may 
formulate 
it 
thus: 
“how 
do 
you, 
among 
all 
people, 
have 
to 
eat 
to 
attain 
your 
maximum 
of 
strength, 
of 
virtu 
in 
the 
Renaissance 
style, 
of 
moraline-free3 
virtue?” 


My 
experiences 
in 
this 
matter 
are 
as 
bad 
as 
possible; 
I 
am 
amazed 
how 
late 
I 
heard 
this 
question, 
how 
late 
I 
learned 
“reason” 
from 
these 
experiences. 
Only 
the 
complete 
worthlessness 
of 
our 
German 
education—its 
“idealism”— 
explains 
to 
me 
to 
some 
extent 
why 
at 
precisely 
this 
point 
I 
was 
backward 
to 
the 
point 
of 
holiness. 
This 
“education” 
which 
teaches 
one 
from 
the 
start 
to 



ignore 
realities 
and 
to 
pursue 
so-called 
“ideal” 
goals—a 
“classical 
education,” 
for 
example—as 
if 
it 
were 
not 
hopeless 
from 
the 
start 
to 
unite 
“classical” 
and 
“German” 
into 
a 
single 
concept! 
More, 
it 
is 
amusing: 
only 
imagine 
a 
“classically 
educated” 
man 
with 
a 
Leipzig 
dialect!4 


Indeed, 
till 
I 
reached 
a 
very 
mature 
age 
I 
always 
ate 
badly: 
morally 
speaking, 
“impersonally,” 
“selflessly,” 
“altruistically”— 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
cooks 
and 
other 
fellow 
Christians. 
By 
means 
of 
Leipzig 
cuisine, 
for 
example, 
I 
very 
earnestly 
denied 
my 
“will 
to 
life” 
at 
the 
time 
when 
I 
first 
read 
Schopenhauer 
(1865). 
To 
upset 
one’s 
stomach 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
inadequate 
nutrition—this 
problem 
seemed 
to 
me 
to 
be 
solved 
incredibly 
well 
by 
the 
aforementioned 
cuisine. 
(It 
is 
said 
that 
1866 
brought 
about 
a 
change 
in 
this 
respect.)5 
But 
German 
cuisine 
quite 
generally—what 
doesn’t 
it 
have 
on 
its 
conscience! 
Soup 
before 
the 
meal 
(in 
Venetian 
cookbooks 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century 
this 
is 
still 
called 
alla 
tedesca);6 
overcooked 
meats, 
vegetables 
cooked 
with 
fat 
and 
flour; 
the 
degeneration 
of 
pastries 
and 
puddings 
into 
paperweights! 
Add 
to 
this 
the 
virtually 
bestial 
prandial 
drinking 
habits 
of 
the 
ancient, 
and 
by 
no 
means 
only 
the 
ancient 
Germans, 
and 
you 
will 
understand 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
German 
spirit—from 
distressed 
intestines. 


The 
German 
spirit 
is 
an 
indigestion: 
it 
does 
not 
finish 
with 
anything. 


But 
English 
diet, 
too—which 
is, 
compared 
to 
the 
German 
and 
even 
to 
the 
French, 
a 
kind 
of 
“return 
to 
nature,” 
meaning 
to 
cannibalism—is 
profoundly 
at 
odds 
with 
my 
instincts: 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
it 
gives 
the 
spirit 
heavy 
feet— 
the 
feet 
of 
English 
women. 


7

The 
best 
cuisine 
is 
that 
of 
Piedmont. 


Alcohol 
is 
bad 
for 
me: 
a 
single 
glass 
of 
wine 
or 
beer 
in 
one 
day 
is 
quite 
sufficient 
to 
turn 
my 
life 
into 
a 
vale 
of 
misery—the 
people 
of 
Munich 
are 
my 
antipodes. 
Assuming 
that 
I 
did 
not 
comprehend 
this 
until 
rather 
late, 
I 
really 
experienced 
it 
from 
childhood. 
As 
a 
boy 
I 
believed 
that 
drinking 
wine 
was, 
like 
smoking, 
to 
begin 
with 
merely 
a 
vanity 
of 
young 
men, 
and 
later 
on 
a 
bad 
habit. 
Perhaps 
this 
harsh 
judgment 
should 
be 
blamed 
in 
part 
on 
the 
wine 
of 
Naumburg.8 
To 
believe 
that 
wine 
exhilarates 
I 
should 
have 
to 
be 
a 
Christian 
—believing 
what 
is 
for 
me 
an 
absurdity. 
Strangely 
enough, 
in 
spite 
of 
this 
extreme 
vulnerability 
to 
small, 
strongly 
diluted 
doses 
of 
alcohol, 
I 
almost 
become 
a 
sailor 
when 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
strong 
doses. 
Even 
as 
a 
boy, 
my 
fortitude 
appeared 
at 
that 
point. 
Writing 
a 
long 
Latin 
essay 
in 
a 
single 
night, 
and 
copying 
it 
over, 
too, 
with 
the 
ambition 
in 
my 
pen 
to 
emulate 
my 
model, 
Sallust, 
in 
severity 
and 
compactness, 
and 
to 
pour 
some 
grog 
of 
the 
heaviest 



caliber 
over 
my 
Latin—even 
when 
I 
was 
a 
student 
at 
the 
venerable 
Schulpforta,9 
that 
did 
not 
in 
any 
way 
disagree 
with 
my 
physiology, 
nor 
perhaps 
with 
that 
of 
Sallust—however 
it 
disagreed 
with 
the 
venerable 
Schulpforta. 


Later, 
around 
the 
middle 
of 
life, 
to 
be 
sure, 
I 
decided 
more 
and 
more 
strictly 
against 
all 
“spirits”: 
I, 
an 
opponent 
of 
vegetarianism 
from 
experience, 
just 
like 
Richard 
Wagner, 
who 
converted 
me, 
cannot 
advise 
all 
more 
spiritual 
natures 
earnestly 
enough 
to 
abstain 
entirely 
from 
alcohol. 
Water 
is 
sufficient. 


I 
prefer 
towns 
in 
which 
opportunities 
abound 
for 
dipping 
from 
running 
wells 
(Nizza, 
Turin, 
Sils); 
a 
small 
glass 
accompanies 
me 
like 
a 
dog.10 
In 
vino 
Veritas:11 
it 
seems 
that 
here, 
too, 
I 
am 
at 
odds 
with 
all 
the 
world 
about 
the 
concept 
of 
“truth”—in 
my 
case, 
the 
spirit 
moves 
over 
water.12 


A 
few 
more 
hints 
from 
my 
morality. 
A 
hearty 
meal 
is 
easier 
to 
digest 
than 
one 
that 
is 
too 
small. 
That 
the 
stomach 
as 
a 
whole 
becomes 
active 
is 
the 
first 
presupposition 
of 
a 
good 
digestion. 
One 
has 
to 
know 
the 
size 
of 
one’s 
stomach. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
one 
should 
be 
warned 
against 
those 
long-
drawn-out 
meals 
which 
I 
call 
interrupted 
sacrificial 
feasts—those 
at 
a 
table 
d’hôte. 


No 
meals 
between 
meals, 
no 
coffee: 
coffee 
spreads 
darkness. 
Tea 
is 
wholesome 
only 
in 
the 
morning. 
A 
little, 
but 
strong: 
tea 
is 
very 
unwholesome 
and 
sicklies 
one 
o’er 
the 
whole 
day 
if 
it 
is 
too 
weak 
by 
a 
single 
degree. 
Everybody 
has 
his 
own 
measure, 
often 
between 
the 
narrowest 
and 
most 
delicate 
limits. 
In 
a 
climate 
that 
is 
very 
agaçant,13 
tea 
is 
not 
advisable 
for 
a 
beginning: 
one 
should 
begin 
an 
hour 
earlier 
with 
a 
cup 
of 
thick, 
oil-less 
cocoa. 


Sit 
as 
little 
as 
possible; 
give 
no 
credence 
to 
any 
thought 
that 
was 
not 
born 
outdoors 
while 
one 
moved 
about 
freely—in 
which 
the 
muscles 
are 
not 
celebrating 
a 
feast, 
too. 
All 
prejudices14 
come 
from 
the 
intestines. 


The 
sedentary 
life—as 
I 
have 
said 
once 
before15—is 
the 
real 
sin 
against 
the 
holy 
spirit. 



2 


The 
question 
of 
place 
and 
climate 
is 
most 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
question 
of 
nutrition. 
Nobody 
is 
free 
to 
live 
everywhere; 
and 
whoever 
has 
to 
solve 
great 
problems 
that 
challenge 
all 
his 
strength 
actually 
has 
a 
very 
restricted 
choice 
in 
this 
matter. 
The 
influence 
of 
climate 
on 
our 
metabolism, 
its 
retardation, 
its 
acceleration, 
goes 
so 
far 
that 
a 
mistaken 
choice 
of 
place 
and 
climate 
can 
not 
only 
estrange 
a 
man 
from 
his 
task 
but 
can 
actually 
keep 
it 
from 
him: 
he 
never 
gets 
to 
see 
it. 
His 
animal 
vigor 
has 
never 
become 
great 
enough 
for 
him 
to 
attain 
that 
freedom 
which 
overflows 
into 
the 
most 
spiritual 
regions 
and 
allows 
one 
to 
recognize: 
this 
only 
I 
can 
do. 


The 
slightest 
sluggishness 
of 
the 
intestines 
is 
entirely 
sufficient, 
once 
it 
has 
become 
a 
bad 
habit, 
to 
turn 
a 
genius 
into 
something 
mediocre, 
something 
“German.” 
The 
German 
climate 
alone 
is 
enough 
to 
discourage 
strong, 
even 
inherently 
heroic, 
intestines. 
The 
tempo 
of 
the 
metabolism 
is 
strictly 
proportionate 
to 
the 
mobility 
or 
lameness 
of 
the 
spirit’s 
feet; 
the 
“spirit” 
itself 
is 
after 
all 
merely 
an 
aspect 
of 
this 
metabolism. 
List 
the 
places 
where 
men 
with 
esprit1 
are 
living 
or 
have 
lived, 
where 
wit, 
subtlety, 
and 
malice 
belonged 
to 
happiness, 
where 
genius 
found 
its 
home 
almost 
of 
necessity: 
all 
of 
them 
have 
excellent 
dry 
air. 
Paris, 
Provence, 
Florence, 
Jerusalem, 
Athens—these 
names 
prove 
something: 
genius 
depends 
on 
dry 
air, 
on 
clear 
skies—that 
is, 
on 
a 
rapid 
metabolism, 
on 
the 
possibility 
of 
drawing 
again 
and 
again 
on 
great, 
even 
tremendous 
quantities 
of 
strength. 
I 
know 
of 
a 
case 
in 
which 
a 
spirit 
of 
generous 
predisposition, 
destined 
for 
greatness, 
became, 
merely 
because 
he 
lacked 
any 
delicate 
instinct 
for 
climate, 
narrow, 
withdrawn, 
a 
peevish 
specialist. 
And 
I 
myself 
might 
ultimately 
have 
become 
just 
such 
a 
case, 
if 
my 
sickness 
had 
not 
forced 
me 
to 
see 
reason, 
to 
reflect 
on 
reason 
in 
reality. 
Now 
that 
the 
effects 
of 
climate 
and 
weather 
are 
familiar 
to 
me 
from 
long 
experience 
and 
I 
take 
readings 
from 
myself 
as 
from 
a 
very 
subtle 
and 
reliable 
instrument—and 
even 
during 
a 
short 
journey, 
say, 
from 
Turin 
to 
Milan, 
my 
system 
registers 
the 
change 
in 
the 
humidity—I 
reflect 
with 
horror 
on 
the 
dismal 
fact 
that 
my 
life, 
except 
for 
the 
last 
ten 
years, 
the 
years 
when 
my 
life 
was 
in 
peril, 
was 
spent 
entirely 
in 
the 
wrong 
places 
that 
were 
nothing 
short 
of 



forbidden 
to 
me. 
Naumburg, 
Schulpforta, 
the 
province 
of 
Thuringia 
quite 
generally, 
Leipzig, 
Basel, 
Venice—so 
many 
disastrous 
places 
for 
my 
physiology. 


Altogether, 
I 
have 
no 
welcome 
memories 
whatever 
from 
my 
whole 
childhood 
and 
youth; 
but 
it 
would 
be 
folly 
to 
drag 
in 
so-called 
“moral” 
reasons, 
such 
as 
the 
undeniable 
lack 
of 
adequate 
company: 
for 
this 
lack 
persists 
today 
as 
it 
has 
always 
persisted, 
without 
preventing 
me 
from 
being 
cheerful 
and 
brave. 
Rather 
it 
was 
the 
ignorance 
in 
physiologicis—that 
damned 
“idealism”—that 
was 
the 
real 
calamity 
in 
my 
life, 
totally 
superfluous 
and 
stupid, 
something 
of 
which 
nothing 
good 
ever 
grew, 
for 
which 
there 
is 
no 
compensation, 
no 
counterbalance. 
The 
consequences 
of 
this 
“idealism” 
provide 
my 
explanation 
of 
all 
blunders, 
all 
great 
instinctual 
aberrations 
and 
“modesties” 
that 
led 
me 
away 
from 
the 
task 
of 
my 
life; 
for 
example, 
that 
I 
became 
a 
philologist—why 
not 
at 
least 
a 
physician 
or 
something 
else 
that 
opens 
one’s 
eyes? 


During 
my 
Basel 
period2 
my 
whole 
spiritual 
diet, 
including 
the 
way 
I 
divided 
up 
my 
day, 
was 
a 
completely 
senseless 
abuse 
of 
extraordinary 
resources, 
without 
any 
new 
supply 
to 
cover 
this 
consumption 
in 
any 
way, 
without 
even 
any 
thought 
about 
consumption 
and 
replenishment. 
Any 
refined 
self-concern, 
any 
protection 
by 
some 
commanding 
instinct 
was 
lacking; 
I 
simply 
posited 
myself 
as 
equal 
to 
any 
nobody; 
it 
was 
a 
“selflessness,” 
an 
oblivion 
of 
all 
distance 
between 
myself 
and 
others 
that 
I 
shall 
never 
forgive 
myself. 
When 
I 
was 
close 
to 
the 
end, 
because 
I 
was 
close 
to 
the 
end, 
I 
began 
to 
reflect 
on 
this 
fundamental 
unreason 
of 
my 
life—this 
“idealism.” 
Only 
my 
sickness 
brought 
me 
to 
reason. 



3 


The 
choice 
of 
nutrition; 
the 
choice 
of 
climate 
and 
place: 
the 
third 
point 
at 
which 
one 
must 
not 
commit 
a 
blunder 
at 
any 
price 
is 
the 
choice 
of 
one’s 
own 
kind 
of 
recreation. 
Here, 
too, 
depending 
on 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
a 
spirit 
is 
sui 
generis,1 
the 
limits 
of 
what 
is 
permitted 
to 
him, 
that 
is, 
profitable 
for 
him, 
are 
narrow, 
quite 
narrow. 
In 
my 
case, 
every 
kind 
of 
reading 
belongs 
among 
my 
recreations—hence 
among 
the 
things 
that 
liberate 
me 
from 
myself, 
that 
allow 
me 
to 
walk 
about 
in 
strange 
sciences 
and 
souls—that 
I 
no 
longer 
take 
seriously. 
Reading 
is 
precisely 
my 
recreation 
from 
my 
own 
seriousness. 
During 
periods 
when 
I 
am 
hard 
at 
work 
you 
will 
not 
find 
me 
surrounded 
by 
books: 
I’d 
beware 
of 
letting 
anyone 
near 
me 
talk, 
much 
less 
think. 
And 
that 
is 
what 
reading 
would 
mean. 


Has 
it 
been 
noted 
that 
in 
that 
profound 
tension 
to 
which 
pregnancy 
condemns 
the 
spirit, 
and 
at 
bottom 
the 
whole 
organism, 
chance 
and 
any 
kind 
of 
stimulus 
from 
the 
outside 
have 
too 
vehement 
an 
effect 
and 
strike2 
too 
deep? 
One 
must 
avoid 
chance 
and 
outside 
stimuli 
as 
much 
as 
possible; 
a 
kind 
of 
walling 
oneself 
in 
belongs 
among 
the 
foremost 
instinctive 
precautions 
of 
spiritual 
pregnancy. 
Should 
I 
permit 
an 
alien 
thought 
to 
scale 
the 
wall 
secretly?— 
And 
that 
is 
what 
reading 
would 
mean. 


The 
periods 
of 
work 
and 
fertility 
are 
followed 
by 
periods 
of 
recreation: 
come 
to 
me, 
pleasant, 
brilliant, 
clever 
books! 


Will 
it 
be 
German 
books? 


I 
must 
count 
back 
half 
a 
year 
before 
catching 
myself 
with 
a 
book 
in 
my 
hand. 
What 
was 
it?— 
A 
superb 
study 
by 
Victor 
Brochard, 
Les 
Sceptiques 
Grecs,3 
in 
which 
my 
Laertiana4 
are 
also 
put 
to 
good 
use. 
The 
skeptics, 
the 
only 
honorable 
type 
among 
the 
equivocal, 
quinquivocal 
tribe 
of 
philosophers! 


Otherwise 
I 
almost 
always 
seek 
refuge 
with 
the 
same 
books—actually, 
a 
small 
number—books 
proved 
to 
me. 
Perhaps 
it 
is 
not 
my 
way 
to 
read 
much, 
or 
diverse 
things: 
a 
reading 
room 
makes 
me 
sick. 
Nor 
is 
it 
my 
way 
to 
love 
much, 
or 
diverse 
things. 
Caution, 
even 
hostility 
against 
new 
books 
comes 
closer 
to 
my 
instincts 
than 
“tolerance,” 
“largeur 
du 
coeur,”5 
and 
other 
“neighbor 
love.”6 



It 
is 
a 
small 
number 
of 
old 
Frenchmen 
to 
whom 
I 
return 
again 
and 
again: 
I 
believe 
only 
in 
French 
culture7 
and 
consider 
everything 
else 
in 
Europe 
today 
that 
calls 
itself 
“culture” 
a 
misunderstanding—not 
to 
speak 
of 
German 
culture. 


The 
few 
cases 
of 
high 
culture 
that 
I 
have 
encountered 
in 
Germany 
have 
all 
been 
of 
French 
origin, 
especially 
Frau 
Cosima 
Wagner, 
by 
far 
the 
first 
voice 
in 
matters 
of 
taste 
that 
I 
have 
ever 
heard. 


The 
fact 
that 
I 
do 
not 
read 
but 
love 
Pascal, 
as 
the 
most 
instructive 
victim 
of 
Christianity, 
murdered 
slowly, 
first 
physically, 
then 
psychologically—the 
whole 
logic 
of 
this 
most 
gruesome 
form 
of 
inhuman 
cruelty; 
that 
I 
have 
in 
my 
spirit—who 
knows? 
perhaps 
also 
in 
my 
body—something 
of 
Montaigne’s 
sportiveness; 
that 
my 
artist’s 
taste 
vindicates 
the 
names 
of 
Molière, 
Corneille, 
and 
Racine, 
not 
without 
fury, 
against 
a 
wild 
genius 
like 
Shakespeare—all 
that 
does 
not 
preclude 
in 
the 
end 
that 
I 
find 
even 
the 
most 
recent 
Frenchmen 
charming 
company. 
I 
do 
not 
see 
from 
what 
century 
of 
the 
past 
one 
could 
dredge 
up 
such 
inquisitive 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
such 
delicate 
psychologists 
as 
in 
contemporary 
Paris: 
tentatively—for 
their 
number 
is 
far 
from 
small—I 
name 
Messieurs 
Paul 
Bourget, 
Pierre 
Loti, 
Gyp, 
Meilhac, 
Anatole 
France, 
Jules 
Lemaître, 
or, 
to 
single 
out 
one 
of 
the 
strong 
race, 
a 
genuine 
Latin 
toward 
whom 
I 
am 
especially 
well 
disposed, 
Guy 
de 
Maupassant.8 
Between 
ourselves, 
I 
prefer 
this 
generation 
even 
to 
their 
great 
teachers 
who, 
without 
exception, 
have 
been 
corrupted 
by 
German 
philosophy 
(M. 
Taine, 
for 
example, 
by 
Hegel, 
to 
whom 
he 
owes 
his 
misunderstanding 
of 
great 
men 
and 
ages). 
As 
far 
as 
Germany 
extends, 
she 
corrupts 
culture. 
Only 
the 
war9 
“redeemed” 
the 
spirit 
in 
France. 


Stendhal, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
beautiful 
accidents 
of 
my 
life—for 
whatever 
marks 
an 
epoch 
in 
it 
came 
my 
way 
by 
accident, 
never 
through 
someone’s 
recommendation—is 
truly 
invaluable 
with 
his 
anticipatory 
psychologist’s 
eye, 
with 
his 
knack 
for 
the 
facts 
which 
is 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
greatest 
of 
factual 
men 
(ex 
ungue 
Napole-onem),10 
and 
finally 
not 
least 
as 
an 
honest 
atheist—a 
species 
that 
is 
rare 
in 
France 
and 
almost 
impossible 
to 
find—with 
all 
due 
respect 
for 
Prosper 
Mérimée.11 


Perhaps 
I 
am 
even 
envious 
of 
Stendhal? 
He 
took 
away 
from 
me 
the 
best 
atheistical 
joke 
that 
precisely 
I 
might 
have 
made: 
“God’s 
only 
excuse 
is 
that 
he 
does 
not 
exist.” 


I 
myself 
have 
said 
somewhere: 
what 
has 
been 
the 
greatest 
objection 
to 


12 


existence 
so 
far? 
God. 



4 


The 
highest 
concept 
of 
the 
lyrical 
poet 
was 
given 
to 
me 
by 
Heinrich 
Heine. 
I 
seek 
in 
vain 
in 
all 
the 
realms 
of 
history 
for 
an 
equally 
sweet 
and 
passionate 
music. 
He 
possessed 
that 
divine 
malice 
without 
which 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
perfection: 
I 
estimate 
the 
value 
of 
men, 
of 
races, 
according 
to 
the 
necessity 
by 
which 
they 
cannot 
conceive 
the 
god 
apart 
from 
the 
satyr. 


And 
how 
he 
handles 
his 
German! 
One 
day 
it 
will 
be 
said 
that 
Heine 
and 
I 
have 
been 
by 
far 
the 
foremost 
artists 
of 
the 
German 
language—at 
an 
incalculable 
distance 
from 
everything 
mere 
Germans 
have 
done 
with 
it.1 


I 
must 
be 
profoundly 
related 
to 
Byron’s 
Manfred: 
all 
these 
abysses 
I 
found 
in 
myself; 
at 
the 
age 
of 
thirteen 
I 
was 
ripe 
for 
this 
work. 
I 
have 
no 
word, 
only 
a 
glance, 
for 
those 
who 
dare 
to 
pronounce 
the 
word 
“Faust” 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
Manfred.2 
The 
Germans 
are 
incapable 
of 
any 
notion 
of 
greatness; 
proof: 
Schumann. 
Simply 
from 
fury 
against 
this 
sugary 
Saxon, 
I 
composed 
a 
counter-overture 
for 
Manfred 
of 
which 
Hans 
von 
Bülow 
said 
that 
he 
had 
never 
seen 
anything 
like 
it 
on 
paper, 
and 
he 
called 
it 
rape 
of 
Euterpe.3 


When 
I 
seek 
my 
ultimate 
formula 
for 
Shakespeare, 
I 
always 
find 
only 
this: 
he 
conceived 
of 
the 
type 
of 
Caesar. 
That 
sort 
of 
thing 
cannot, 
be 
guessed: 
one 
either 
is 
it, 
or 
one 
is 
not. 
The 
great 
poet 
dips 
only 
from 
his 
own 
reality—up 
to 
the 
point 
where 
afterward 
he 
cannot 
endure 
his 
work 
any 
longer. 


When 
I 
have 
looked 
into 
my 
Zarathustra, 
I 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
in 
my 
room 
for 
half 
an 
hour, 
unable 
to 
master 
an 
unbearable 
fit 
of 
sobbing. 


I 
know 
no 
more 
heart-rending 
reading 
than 
Shakespeare: 
what 
must 
a 
man 
have 
suffered 
to 
have 
such 
a 
need 
of 
being 
a 
buffoon!4 


Is 
Hamlet 
understood? 
Not 
doubt, 
certainty 
is 
what 
drives 
one 
insane.5— 
But 
one 
must 
be 
profound, 
an 
abyss, 
a 
philosopher 
to 
feel 
that 
way.— 
We 
are 
all 
afraid 
of 
truth. 


And 
let 
me 
confess 
it: 
I 
feel 
instinctively 
sure 
and 
certain 
that 
Lord 
Bacon 
was 
the 
originator, 
the 
self-tormentor6 
of 
this 
uncanniest 
kind 
of 
literature: 
what 
is 
the 
pitiable 
chatter 
of 
American 
flat-and 
muddle-heads 
to 
me? 
But 
the 
strength 
required 
for 
the 
vision 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
reality 
is 
not 
only 
compatible 
with 
the 
most 
powerful 
strength 
for 
action, 
for 
monstrous 
action, 



for 
crime—it 
even 
presupposes 
it.7 


We 
are 
very 
far 
from 
knowing 
enough 
about 
Lord 
Bacon, 
the 
first 
realist 
in 
every 
great 
sense 
of 
that 
word, 
to 
know 
everything 
he 
did, 
wanted, 
and 
experienced 
in 
himself. 


And 
damn 
it, 
my 
dear 
critics! 
Suppose 
I 
had 
published 
my 
Zarathustra 
under 
another 
name—for 
example, 
that 
of 
Richard 
Wagner—the 
acuteness 
of 
two 
thousand 
years 
would 
not 
have 
been 
sufficient 
for 
anyone 
to 
guess 
that 
the 
author 
of 
Human, 
All-Too-Human 
is 
the 
visionary 
of 
Zarathustra. 



5 


Speaking 
of 
the 
recreations 
of 
my 
life, 
I 
must 
say 
a 
word 
to 
express 
my 
gratitude 
for 
what 
has 
been 
by 
far 
the 
most 
profound 
and 
cordial 
recreation 
of 
my 
life. 
Beyond 
a 
doubt, 
that 
was 
my 
intimate 
relationship 
with 
Richard 
Wagner. 
I’d 
let 
go 
cheap 
the 
whole 
rest 
of 
my 
human 
relationships; 
I 
should 
not 
want 
to 
give 
away 
out 
of 
my 
life 
at 
any 
price 
the 
days 
of 
Tribschen1— 
days 
of 
trust, 
of 
cheerfulness, 
of 
sublime 
accidents, 
of 
profound 
moments. 


I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
experiences 
others 
have 
had 
with 
Wagner: 
our 
sky 
was 
never 
darkened 
by 
a 
single 
cloud. 


And 
with 
that 
I 
return 
once 
more 
to 
France—I 
have 
no 
reasons 
but 
merely 
a 
contemptuous 
corner 
of 
the 
mouth 
for 
Wagnerians 
et 
hoc 
genus 
omne2 
who 
think 
they 
are 
honoring 
Wagner 
by 
finding 
him 
similar 
to 
themselves. 


The 
way 
I 
am, 
so 
alien 
in 
my 
deepest 
instincts 
to 
everything 
German 
that 
the 
mere 
proximity 
of 
a 
German 
retards 
my 
digestion, 
the 
first 
contact 
with 
Wagner 
was 
also 
the 
first 
deep 
breath 
of 
my 
life: 
I 
experienced, 
I 
revered 
him 
as 
a 
foreign 
land, 
as 
an 
antithesis, 
as 
an 
incarnate 
protest 
against 
all 
“German 
virtues.” 


We 
who 
were 
children 
in 
the 
swamp 
air 
of 
the 
fifties 
are 
of 
necessity 
pessimists 
concerning 
the 
concept 
“German”; 
we 
simply 
cannot 
be 
anything 
but 
revolutionaries—we 
shall 
not 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
any 
state 
of 
affairs 
in 
which 
the 
bigot3 
is 
at 
the 
top. 
It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
total 
indifference 
to 
me 
whether 
today 
he 
dons 
different 
colors, 
clothing 
himself 
in 
scarlet 
and 
putting 
on 
a 
hussar’s 
uniform.4 


Well 
then! 
Wagner 
was 
a 
revolutionary—he 
ran 
away 
from 
the 
Germans.5 


As 
an 
artist 
one 
has 
no 
home 
in 
Europe, 
except 
Paris: 
the 
délicatesse 
in 
all 
five 
artistic 
senses 
that 
is 
presupposed 
by 
Wagner’s 
art, 
the 
fingers 
for 
nuances, 
the 
psychological 
morbidity 
are 
found 
only 
in 
Paris. 
Nowhere 
else 
does 
one 
have 
this 
passion 
in 
questions 
of 
form, 
this 
seriousness 
in 
mise 
en 
scène6—which 
is 
Parisian 
seriousness 
par 
excellence. 
In 
Germany 
people 
simply 
lack 
any 
notion 
of 
the 
tremendous 
ambition 
that 
lives 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
Parisian 
artist. 
Germans 
are 
good-natured—Wagner 
was 
anything 
but 
good-
natured. 



But 
I 
have 
long 
said 
adequately 
(in 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
section 
256)7 
where 
Wagner 
belongs 
and 
who 
are 
his 
closest 
relatives: 
the 
late 
French 
romantics, 
that 
high-flying 
and 
yet 
rousing 
manner 
of 
artists 
like 
Delacroix, 
like 
Berlioz, 
with 
a 
characteristic 
fond8 
of 
sickness, 
of 
incurability—all 
of 
them 
fanatics 
of 
expression, 
virtuosos 
through 
and 
through. 


Who 
was 
the 
first 
intelligent 
adherent 
of 
Wagner 
anywhere? 
Charles 
Baudelaire, 
who 
was 
also 
the 
first 
to 
understand 
Delacroix—that 
typical 
decadent 
in 
whom 
a 
whole 
tribe 
of 
artists 
recognized 
themselves—and 
perhaps 
he 
was 
also 
the 
last.9 


What 
did 
I 
never 
forgive 
Wagner? 
That 
he 
condescended 
to 
the 
Germans 


10 


—that 
he 
became 
reichsdeutsch. 
As 
far 
as 
Germany 
extends, 
she 
corrupts 
culture.11 



6 


All 
things 
considered, 
I 
could 
not 
have 
endured 
my 
youth 
without 
Wagner’s 
music. 
For 
I 
was 
condemned 
to 
Germans. 
If 
one 
wants 
to 
rid 
oneself 
of 
an 
unbearable 
pressure, 
one 
needs 
hashish. 
Well 
then, 
I 
needed 
Wagner. 
Wagner 
is 
the 
antitoxin 
against 
everything 
German 
par 
excellence— 
a 
toxin, 
a 
poison, 
that 
I 
don’t 
deny. 


From 
the 
moment 
when 
there 
was 
a 
piano 
score 
of 
Tristan—my 
compliments, 
Herr 
von 
Bülow—I 
was 
a 
Wagnerian.1 
Wagner’s 
older 
works 
I 
deemed 
beneath 
myself—still 
too 
vulgar, 
too 
“German.” 


But 
to 
this 
day 
I 
am 
still 
looking 
for 
a 
work 
that 
equals 
the 
dangerous 
fascination 
and 
the 
gruesome2 
and 
sweet 
infinity 
of 
Tristan—and 
look 
in 
all 
the 
arts 
in 
vain. 
All 
the 
strangenesses 
of 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci 
emerge 
from 
their 
spell 
at 
the 
first 
note 
of 
Tristan. 
This 
work 
is 
emphatically 
Wagner’s 
non 
plus 
ultra; 
with 
the 
Meistersinger 
and 
the 
Ring 
he 
recuperated3 
from 
it. 
Becoming 
healthier—is 
a 
retrogression, 
given 
a 
nature 
like 
Wagner’s. 


I 
take 
it 
for 
a 
good 
fortune 
of 
the 
first 
order 
that 
I 
lived 
at 
the 
right 
time 
and 
among 
Germans, 
of 
all 
peoples, 
so 
that 
I 
was 
ripe 
for 
this 
work: 
that 
is 
how 
far 
the 
psychologist’s 
inquisitiveness 
extends 
in 
my 
case. 
The 
world 
is 
poor 
for 
anyone 
who 
has 
never 
been 
sick 
enough 
for 
this 
“voluptuousness 
of 
hell”: 
it 
is 
permitted, 
it 
is 
almost 
imperative, 
to 
employ 
a 
formula 
of 
the 
mystics 
at 
this 
point. 


I 
think 
I 
know 
better 
than 
anyone 
else 
of 
what 
tremendous 
things 
Wagner 
is 
capable—the 
fifty 
worlds 
of 
alien 
ecstasies 
for 
which 
no 
one 
besides 
him 
had 
wings; 
and 
given 
the 
way 
I 
am, 
strong 
enough 
to 
turn 
even 
what 
is 
most 
questionable 
and 
dangerous 
to 
my 
advantage 
and 
thus 
to 
become 
stronger, 
I 
call 
Wagner 
the 
great 
benefactor 
of 
my 
life. 
That 
in 
which 
we 
are 
related— 
that 
we 
have 
suffered 
more 
profoundly, 
also 
from 
each 
other, 
than 
men 
of 
this 
century 
are 
capable 
of 
suffering—will 
link 
our 
names 
again 
and 
again, 
eternally; 
and 
as 
certainly 
as 
Wagner 
is 
merely 
a 
misunderstanding 
among 
Germans, 
just 
as 
certainly 
I 
am 
and 
always 
shall 
be. 


Two 
centuries 
of 
psychological 
and 
artistic 
discipline 
must 
come 
first, 
my 
dear 
Teutons!— 
But 
with 
that 
one 
does 
not 
catch 
up. 



7 


I 
shall 
say 
another 
word 
for 
the 
most 
select 
ears: 
what 
I 
really 
want 
from 
music. 
That 
it 
be 
cheerful 
and 
profound 
like 
an 
afternoon 
in 
October. 
That 
it 
be 
individual, 
frolicsome, 
tender, 
a 
sweet 
small 
woman 
full 
of 
beastliness 
and 
charm. 


I 
shall 
never 
admit 
that 
a 
German 
could 
know 
what 
music 
is. 
Those 
who 
are 
called 
German 
composers—the 
greatest 
above 
all—are 
foreigners: 
Slavs, 
Croats, 
Italians, 
Dutchmen—or 
Jews; 
otherwise, 
Germans 
of 
the 
strong 
race, 
extinct 
Germans, 
like 
Heinrich 
Schütz, 
Bach, 
and 
Handel. 
I 
myself 
am 
still 
enough 
of 
a 
Pole 
to 
surrender 
the 
rest 
of 
music 
for 
Chopin, 
excepting, 
for 
three 
reasons, 
Wagner’s 
Siegfried 
Idyll, 
perhaps 
also 
a 
few 
things 
by 
Liszt, 
who 
surpasses 
all 
other 
musicians 
in 
his 
noble 
orchestral 
accents, 
and, 
finally, 
everything 
that 
grew 
beyond 
the 
Alps—this 
side.1 


I 
should 
not 
know 
how 
to 
get 
along 
without 
Rossini; 
even 
less, 
without 
my 
own 
south 
in 
music, 
the 
music 
of 
my 
Venetian 
maëstro 
Pietro 
Gasti.2 
And 
when 
I 
say 
beyond 
the 
Alps, 
I 
really 
merely 
say 
Venice. 
When 
I 
seek 
another 
word 
for 
music, 
I 
always 
find 
only 
the 
word 
Venice. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
how 
to 
distinguish 
between 
tears 
and 
music—I 
do 
not 
know 
how 
to 
think 
of 
happiness, 
of 
the 
south, 
without 
shudders 
of 
timidity. 


At 
the 
bridge 
I 
stood 
lately 
in 
the 
brown 
night. 
From 
afar 
came 
a 
song: 
as 
a 
golden 
drop 
it 
welled 
over 
the 
quivering 
surface. 
Gondolas, 
lights, 
and 
music— 
drunken 
it 
swam 
out 
into 
the 
twilight. 


My 
soul, 
a 
stringed 
instrument, 
sang 
to 
itself, 
invisibly 
touched, 
a 
secret 
gondola 
song, 
quivering 
with 
iridescent 
happiness. 
—Did 
anyone 
listen 
to 
it? 



 
8 


In 
all 
these 
matters—in 
the 
choice 
of 
nutrition, 
of 
place 
and 
climate, 
of 
recreation—an 
instinct 
of 
self-preservation 
issues 
its 
commandments, 
and 
it 
gains 
its 
most 
unambiguous 
expression 
as 
an 
instinct 
of 
self-defense. 
Not 
to 
see 
many 
things, 
not 
to 
hear 
many 
things, 
not 
to 
permit 
many 
things 
to 
come 
close—first 
imperative 
of 
prudence, 
first 
proof 
that 
one 
is 
no 
mere 
accident 
but 
a 
necessity. 
The 
usual 
word 
for 
this 
instinct 
of 
self-defense 
is 
taste. 
It 
commands 
us 
not 
only 
to 
say 
No 
when 
Yes 
would 
be 
“selfless” 
but 
also 
to 
say 
No 
as 
rarely 
as 
possible. 
To 
detach 
oneself, 
to 
separate 
oneself 
from 
anything 
that 
would 
make 
it 
necessary 
to 
keep 
saying 
No. 
The 
reason 
in 
this 
is 
that 
when 
defensive 
expenditures, 
be 
they 
ever 
so 
small, 
become 
the 
rule 
and 
a 
habit, 
they 
entail 
an 
extraordinary 
and 
entirely 
superfluous 
impoverishment. 
Our 
great 
expenses 
are 
composed 
of 
the 
most 
frequent 
small 
ones. 
Warding 
off, 
not 
letting 
things 
come 
close, 
involves 
an 
expenditure—let 
nobody 
deceive 
himself 
about 
this—energy 
wasted 
on 
negative 
ends. 
Merely 
through 
the 
constant 
need 
to 
ward 
off, 
one 
can 
become 
weak 
enough 
to 
be 
unable 
to 
defend 
oneself 
any 
longer. 


Suppose 
I 
stepped 
out 
of 
my 
house 
and 
found, 
instead 
of 
quiet, 
aristocratic 
Turin, 
a 
small 
German 
town: 
my 
instinct 
would 
have 
to 
cast 
up 
a 
barrier 
to 
push 
back 
everything 
that 
would 
assail 
it 
from 
this 
pinched 
and 
flattened, 
cowardly 
world. 
Or 
I 
found 
a 
German 
big 
city—this 
built-up 
vice 
where 
nothing 
grows, 
where 
everything, 
good 
or 
bad, 
is 
imported. 
Wouldn’t 
this 
compel 
me 
to 
become 
a 
hedgehog? 


But 
having 
quills 
is 
a 
waste, 
even 
a 
double 
luxury 
when 
one 
can 
choose 
not 
to 
have 
quills 
but 
open 
hands. 


Another 
counsel 
of 
prudence 
and 
self-defense 
is 
to 
react 
as 
rarely 
as 
possible, 
and 
to 
avoid 
situations 
and 
relationships 
that 
would 
condemn 
one 
to 
suspend, 
as 
it 
were, 
one’s 
“freedom” 
and 
initiative 
and 
to 
become 
a 
mere 
reagent. 
As 
a 
parable 
I 
choose 
association 
with 
books. 
Scholars 
who 
at 
bottom 
do 
little 
nowadays 
but 
thumb 
books—philologists, 
at 
a 
moderate 
estimate, 
about 
200 
a 
day—ultimately 
lose 
entirely 
their 
capacity 
to 
think 
for 
themselves. 
When 
they 
don’t 
thumb, 
they 
don’t 
think. 
They 
respond 
to 
a 
stimulus 
(a 
thought 
they 
have 
read) 
whenever 
they 
think—in 
the 
end, 
they 
do 



nothing 
but 
react. 
Scholars 
spend 
all 
of 
their 
energies 
on 
saying 
Yes 
and 
No, 
on 
criticism 
of 
what 
others 
have 
thought—they 
themselves 
no 
longer 
think. 


The 
instinct 
of 
self-defense 
has 
become 
worn-out 
in 
them; 
otherwise 
they 
would 
resist 
books. 
The 
scholar—a 
decadent. 


I 
have 
seen 
this 
with 
my 
own 
eyes: 
gifted 
natures 
with 
a 
generous 
and 
free 
disposition, 
“read 
to 
ruin” 
in 
their 
thirties—merely 
matches 
that 
one 
has 
to 
strike 
to 
make 
them 
emit 
sparks—“thoughts.” 


Early 
in 
the 
morning, 
when 
day 
breaks, 
when 
all 
is 
fresh, 
in 
the 
dawn 
of 
one’s 
strength—to 
read 
a 
book 
at 
such 
a 
time 
is 
simply 
depraved! 



9 


At 
this 
point 
the 
real 
answer 
to 
the 
question, 
how 
one 
becomes 
what 
one 
is, 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
avoided. 
And 
thus 
I 
touch 
on 
the 
masterpiece 
of 
the 
art 
of 
self-preservation—of 
selfishness. 


For 
let 
us 
assume 
that 
the 
task, 
the 
destiny, 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
task 
transcends 
the 
average 
very 
significantly: 
in 
that 
case, 
nothing 
could 
be 
more 
dangerous 
than 
catching 
sight 
of 
oneself 
with 
this 
task. 
To 
become 
what 
one 
is, 
one 
must 
not 
have 
the 
faintest 
notion 
what 
one 
is. 
From 
this 
point 
of 
view 
even 
the 
blunders 
of 
life 
have 
their 
own 
meaning 
and 
value—the 
occasional 
side 
roads 
and 
wrong 
roads, 
the 
delays, 
“modesties,” 
seriousness 
wasted 
on 
tasks 
that 
are 
remote 
from 
the 
task. 
All 
this 
can 
express 
a 
great 
prudence, 
even 
the 
supreme 
prudence: 
where 
nosce 
te 
ipsum1 
would 
be 
the 
recipe 
for 
ruin,2 
forgetting 
oneself, 
misunderstanding 
oneself, 
making 
oneself 
smaller, 
narrower, 
mediocre, 
become 
reason 
itself. 
Morally 
speaking: 
neighbor 
love, 
living 
for 
others, 
and 
other 
things 
can 
be 
a 
protective 
measure 
for 
preserving 
the 
hardest 
self-concern. 
This 
is 
the 
exception 
where, 
against 
my 
wont 
and 
conviction, 
I 
side 
with 
the 
“selfless” 
drives: 
here 
they 
work 
in 
the 
service 
of 
self-love, 
of 
self-discipline.3 


The 
whole 
surface 
of 
consciousness—consciousness 
is 
a 
surface4—must 
be 
kept 
clear 
of 
all 
great 
imperatives. 
Beware 
even 
of 
every 
great 
word, 
every 
great 
pose! 
So 
many 
dangers 
that 
the 
instinct 
comes 
too 
soon 
to 
“understand 
itself”——. 
Meanwhile 
the 
organizing 
“idea” 
that 
is 
destined 
to 
rule 
keeps 
growing 
deep 
down—it 
begins 
to 
command; 
slowly 
it 
leads 
us 
back 
from 
side 
roads 
and 
wrong 
roads; 
it 
prepares 
single 
qualities 
and 
fitnesses 
that 
will 
one 
day 
prove 
to 
be 
indispensable 
as 
means 
toward 
a 
whole—one 
by 
one, 
it 
trains 
all 
subservient 
capacities 
before 
giving 
any 
hint 
of 
the 
dominant 
task, 
“goal,” 
“aim,” 
or 
“meaning.” 


Considered 
in 
this 
way, 
my 
life 
is 
simply 
wonderful. 
For 
the 
task 
of 
a 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
more 
capacities 
may 
have 
been 
needed 
than 
have 
ever 
dwelt 
together 
in 
a 
single 
individual—above 
all, 
even 
contrary 
capacities 
that 
had 
to 
be 
kept 
from 
disturbing, 
destroying 
one 
another. 
An 
order 
of 
rank 
among 
these 
capacities; 
distance; 
the 
art 
of 
separating 
without 
setting 
against 



one 
another; 
to 
mix 
nothing, 
to 
“reconcile” 
nothing; 
a 
tremendous 
variety 
that 
is 
nevertheless 
the 
opposite 
of 
chaos—this 
was 
the 
precondition, 
the 
long, 
secret 
work 
and 
artistry 
of 
my 
instinct. 
Its 
higher 
protection 
manifested 
itself 
to 
such 
a 
high 
degree 
that 
I 
never 
even 
suspected 
what 
was 
growing 
in 
me— 
and 
one 
day 
all 
my 
capacities, 
suddenly 
ripe, 
leaped 
forth 
in 
their 
ultimate 
perfection.5 
I 
cannot 
remember 
that 
I 
ever 
tried 
hard6—no 
trace 
of 
struggle 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
my 
life; 
I 
am 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
heroic 
nature. 
“Willing” 
something, 
“striving”7 
for 
something, 
envisaging 
a 
“purpose,” 
a 
“wish”—I 
know 
none 
of 
this 
from 
experience. 
At 
this 
very 
moment 
I 
still 
look 
upon 
my 
future—an 
ample 
future!—as 
upon 
calm 
seas: 
there 
is 
no 
ripple 
of 
desire. 
I 
do 
not 
want 
in 
the 
least 
that 
anything 
should 
become 
different 
than 
it 
is; 
I 
myself 
do 
not 
want 
to 
become 
different. 


But 
that 
is 
how 
I 
have 
always 
lived. 
I 
had 
no 
wishes. 
A 
man 
over 
forty-
four 
who 
can 
say 
that 
he 
never 
strove8 
for 
honors, 
for 
women, 
for 
money! 


Thus 
it 
happened, 
for 
example, 
that 
one 
day 
I 
was 
a 
university 
professor— 
no 
such 
idea 
had 
ever 
entered 
my 
mind., 
for 
I 
was 
barely 
twenty-four 
years 
old. 
Thus 
it 
happened 
two 
years 
earlier 
that 
one 
day 
I 
was 
suddenly 
a 
philologist—insofar 
as 
my 
first 
philological 
essay, 
my 
beginning 
in 
every 
sense, 
was 
requested 
by 
my 
teacher, 
Ritschl, 
for 
publication 
in 
his 
Rheinisches 
Museum.9 
(Ritsehl—I 
say 
it 
with 
reverence—the 
only 
scholar 
of 
genius 
on 
whom 
I 
have 
laid 
eyes 
to 
this 
day. 
He 
was 
characterized 
by 
that 
agreeable 
corruption 
which 
distinguishes 
us 
Thuringians 
and 
which 
makes 
even 
Germans 
sympathetic: 
even 
to 
reach 
truth, 
we 
still 
prefer 
furtive 
paths. 
These 
words 
are 
not 
meant 
to 
underestimate 
my 
close 
compatriot, 
the 
clever

von 
Ranke——.)10

One 
will 
ask 
me 
why 
on 
earth 
I’ve 
been 
relating 
all 
these 
small 
things 
which 
are 
generally 
considered 
matters 
of 
complete 
indifference: 
I 
only 
harm 
myself, 
the 
more 
so 
if 
I 
am 
destined 
to 
represent 
great 
tasks. 
Answer: 
these 
small 
things—nutrition, 
place, 
climate, 
recreation, 
the 
whole 
casuistry 
of 
selfishness—are 
inconceivably 
more 
important 
than 
everything 
one 
has 
taken 
to 
be 
important 
so 
far. 
Precisely 
here 
one 
must 
begin 
to 
relearn. 
What 
mankind 
has 
so 
far 
considered 
seriously 
have 
not 
even 
been 
realities 
but 
mere 
imaginings—more 
strictly 
speaking, 
lies 
prompted 
by 
the 
bad 
instincts 
of 
sick 
natures 
that 
were 
harmful 
in 
the 
most 
profound 
sense—all 
these 
concepts, 
“God,” 
“soul,” 
“virtue,” 
“sin,” 
“beyond,” 
“truth,” 
“eternal 
life.”— 
But 
the 
greatness 
of 
human 
nature, 
its 
“divinity,” 
was 
sought 
in 
them.— 
All 
the 
problems 
of 
politics, 
of 
social 
organization, 
and 
of 
education 
have 
been 
falsified 
through 
and 
through 
because 
one 
mistook 
the 
most 
harmful 
men 
for 
great 
men—because 
one 
learned 
to 
despise 
“little” 
things, 
which 
means 
the 
basic 
concerns 
of 
life 
itself.1 


When 
I 
now 
compare 
myself 
with 
the 
men 
who 
have 
so 
far 
been 
honored 
as 
the 
first, 
the 
difference 
is 
palpable. 
I 
do 
not 
even 
count 
these 
so-called 
“first” 
men 
among 
men 
in 
general: 
for 
me 
they 
are 
the 
refuse 
of 
humanity, 
monsters 
of 
sickness 
and 
vengeful 
instincts; 
they 
are 
inhuman, 
disastrous, 
at 
bottom 
incurable, 
and 
revenge 
themselves 
on 
life. 


I 
want 
to 
be 
their 
opposite: 
it 
is 
my 
privilege 
to 
have 
the 
subtlest 
sensitivity 
for 
all 
signs 
of 
healthy 
instincts. 
There 
is 
no 
pathological 
trait 
in 
me; 
even 
in 
periods 
of 
severe 
sickness 
I 
never 
became 
pathological; 
in 
vain 
would 
one 
seek 
for 
a 
trait 
of 
fanaticism 
in 
my 
character. 
There 
is 
not 
a 
moment 
in 
my 
life 
to 
which 
one 
could 
point 
to 
convict 
me 
of 
a 
presumptuous 
and 
pathetic2 
posture. 
The 
pathos 
of 
poses 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
greatness; 
whoever 
needs 
poses 
at 
all 
is 
false.— 
Beware 
of 
all 
picturesque 
men! 


Life 
was 
easy 
for 
me—easiest 
when 
it 
made 
the 
hardest 
demands 
on 
me. 
Whoever 
saw 
me 
during 
the 
seventy 
days 
this 
fall 
when, 
without 
interruption, 
I 
did 
several 
things 
of 
the 
first 
rank 
the 
like 
of 
which 
nobody 
will 
do 
after 
me 
—or 
impose 
on 
me3—with 
a 
responsibility 
for 
all 
millennia 
after 
me, 
will 
not 



have 
noticed 
any 
trace 
of 
tension 
in 
me; 
but 
rather 
an 
overflowing 
freshness 
and 
cheerfulness. 
I 
never 
ate 
with 
more 
pleasant 
feelings; 
I 
never 
slept 
better. 


I 
do 
not 
know 
any 
other 
way 
of 
associating 
with 
great 
tasks 
than 
play: 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
greatness, 
this 
is 
an 
essential 
presupposition. 
The 
least 
compulsion, 
a 
gloomy 
mien, 
or 
any 
harsh 
tone 
in 
the 
throat 
are 
all 
objections 
to 
a 
man; 
how 
much 
more 
against 
his 
work!— 
One 
must 
not 
have 
any 
nerves.— 
Suffering 
from 
solitude 
is 
also 
an 
objection—I 
have 
suffered 
only 
from 
“multitudes.” 


At 
an 
absurdly 
early 
age, 
at 
seven, 
I 
already 
knew 
that 
no 
human 
word 
would 
ever 
reach 
me: 
has 
anyone 
ever 
seen 
me 
saddened 
on 
that 
account? 


To 
this 
day 
I 
still 
have 
the 
same 
affability 
for 
everyone; 
I 
even 
treat 
with 
special 
respect 
those 
who 
are 
lowliest: 
in 
all 
of 
this 
there 
is 
not 
one 
grain 
of 
arrogance 
or 
secret 
contempt. 
If 
I 
despise 
a 
man, 
he 
guesses 
that 
I 
despise 
him: 
by 
my 
mere 
existence 
I 
outrage 
everything 
that 
has 
bad 
blood 
in 
its 
veins. 


My 
formula 
for 
greatness 
in 
a 
human 
being 
is 
amor 
fati:4 
that 
one 
wants 
nothing 
to 
be 
different, 
not 
forward, 
not 
backward, 
not 
in 
all 
eternity. 
Not 
merely 
bear 
what 
is 
necessary, 
still 
less 
conceal 
it—all 
idealism 
is 
mendaciousness 
in 
the 
face 
of 
what 
is 
necessary—but 
love 
it.

Ich 
bin 
zu 
neugierig, 
zu 
fragwürdig, 
zu 
übermütig, 
um 
mir 
eine 
faustgrobe 
Antwort 
gefallen 
zu 
lassen. 
Nietzsche’s 
atheism 
is 
not 
a 
“result”; 
it 
is 
a 
corrolary 
of 
his 
commitment 
to 
question 
every 
conviction, 
including 
his 
own 
convictions. 
In 
a 
sense, 
of 
course, 
he 
does 
know 
atheism 
“as 
an 
event”; 
namely, 
as 
a 
cultural 
event 
which 
he 
designated 
with 
the 
words, 
“God 
is 
dead” 
(Gay 
Science, 
section 
125; 
Zarathustra, 
Prologue, 
section 
2: 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
pp. 
95f., 
124). 
What 
he 
means 
above 
is 
that 
he 
did 
not 
experience 
the 
loss 
of 
faith 
in 
God 
as 
an 
event 
in 
his 
own 
life: 
he 
did 
not 
pass 
through 
any 
crisis 
of 
faith.

(Rede

Nietzsche’s 
reference 
to 
“mere 
Germans” 
makes 
a 
point 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
Heine 
was 
a 
Jew 
(and 
very 
widely 
resented), 
and 
Nietzsche 
took 
himself 
to 
be 
of 
Polish 
descent.

Nietzsche 
neither 
emphasizes 
book 
titles 
nor 
usually 
places 
them 
in 
quotes 
after 
the 
German 
manner; 
but 
the 
comparison 
Nietzsche 
intends 
is 
presumably 
between 
the 
two 
heroes, 
Faust 
and 
Manfred. 
Nietzsche’s 
tremendous 
admiration 
for 
Goethe 
was 
not 
primarily 
based 
on 
Faust.

The 
muse 
of 
music. 
Bülow 
(1830–1894) 
was 
a 
pianist 
and 
conductor. 
In 
1857 
he 
married 
Cosima 
Liszt, 
who 
later 
left 
him 
for 
Richard 
Wagner, 
whom 
she 
married 
in 
1870.

Freud

that

Earl 
of 
Oxford

Presumably 
Nietzsche 
means 
that 
he 
has 
been 
persuaded 
not 
by 
American 
Baconians 
but 
by 
considerations 
of 
his 
own. 
Bacon 
was 
Lord 
Chancellor, 
and 
the 
“crime” 
to 
which 
he 
pleaded 
guilty 
in 
1621 
was 
bribery. 
He 
explained: 
“I 
was 
the 
justest 
judge 
that 
was 
in 
England 
these 
fifty 
years; 
but 
it 
was 
the 
justest 
censure 
in 
Parliament 
that 
was 
these 
two 
hundred 
years.” 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
general 
practice 
of 
the 
age, 
he 
said, 
he 
had 
accepted 
gifts 
from 
litigants; 
but 
his 
judgment 
had 
never 
been 
swayed 
by 
a 
bribe.

This 
would 
take 
us 
back 
to 
the 
spring 
of 
1861 
when 
Nietzsche 
was 
sixteen. 
Indeed, 
the 
text 
of 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
own 
compositions, 
dated 
June 
1861, 
“included 
an 
unmistakable 
token 
of 
the 
proximity 
of 
Tristan 
und 
Isolde: 
‘Wild 
wogt 
der 
Wahn, 
wo 
durch 
bewegt, 
das 
Wunder 
wollend 
mein 
Gemüth? 
[sic]’ 
” 
(Frederick 
R. 
Love, 
Young 
Nietzsche 
and 
the 
Wagnerian 
Experience, 
Chapel 
Hill, 
N. 
C, 
University 
of 
North 
Carolina 
Press, 
1963, 
p. 
22; 
reviewed 
by 
Walter 
Kaufmann 
in 
Journal 
of 
the 
History 
of 
Philosophy, 
October 
1965, 
pp. 
284–86). 
The 
quoted 
passage 
reads 
like 
a 
parody 
of 
Wagner 
and 
makes 
little 
sense: 
“Wildly 
illusion 
surges, 
whereby 
moves 
the 
wonder 
wishing 
my 
bosom?” 
Nevertheless, 
Love, 
making 
use 
of 
unpublished 
materials, 
including 
Nietzsche’s 
compositions, 
argues 
convincingly 
that 
Nietzsche 
never 
was 
“a 
passionate 
devotee 
of 
Wagnerian 
music” 
(p. 
viii). 
He 
finds 
“nothing 
whatever 
Wagnerian” 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
songs 
between 
1862 
and 
1865 
(p. 
28); 
he 
cites 
a 
letter 
of 
the 
winter 
1865–66 
in 
which 
Nietzsche, 
then 
a 
student, 
wrote, 
“Three 
things 
are 
my 
recreations, 
but 
rare 
recreations, 
my 
Schopenhauer, 
Schumann’s 
music, 
finally 
long 
walks”; 
and 
he 
cites 
a 
list 
Nietzsche 
made 
around 
the 
same 
time 
of 
his 
musical 
favorites: 
Schumann, 
Beethoven, 
and 
Schubert 
are 
most 
prominent, 
“two 
choral 
works 
by 
Bach 
are 
mentioned, 
‘ein 
paar’ 
[a 
couple 
of] 
Lieder 
of 
Brahms, 
and 
of 
Wagner 
only 
the 
early 
opera 
Tannhäuser, 
listed 
indiscriminately 
next 
to 
a 
work 
by 
Meyerbeer” 
(p. 
35). 
Love 
argues 
further: 
“As 
for 
Wagner’s 
music, 
it 
can 
be 
stated 
unequivocally 
that 
Die 
Meistersinger 
was 
the 
only 
one 
of 
the 
mature 
works 
which 
Nietzsche 
acquired 
fully 
on 
his 
own 
and 
the 
one 
which 
he 



knew 
best 
from 
actual 
performance” 
(p. 
63). 
Tristan 
he 
heard 
only 
twice, 
in 
June 
1872, 
in 
Munich, 
where 
“Hans 
von 
Bülow 
gave 
the 
European 
musical 
public 
its 
second 
chance 
to 
experience 
a 
production 
of 
Tristan” 
(p. 
64). 
Love 
thinks 
that 
Tristan 
“became 
for 
Nietzsche 
the 
permanent 
symbol 
of 
his 
unforgettable 
Tribschen 
experience” 
because 
“Wagner 
himself 
must 
have 
opened 
his 
mind 
to 
the 
deeper 
meaning 
of 
his 
most 
radical 
work” 
(p. 
65). 
Love 
fails 
to 
note 
that 
Nietzsche’s 
tribute 
to 
von 
Bülow 
in 
the 
text 
above 
evidently 
conflates 
two 
events: 
the 
one 
in 
1861 
to 
which 
Nietzsche 
alludes, 
and 
the 
other 
in 
1872. 
Love 
also 
refers 
to 
(p. 
69) 
but 
does 
not 
quote 
von 
Bülow’s 
scathing 
letter 
to 
Nietzsche 
about 
one 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
compositions. 
It 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
Nietzsche 
cites 
this 
letter 
in 
section 
4 
above, 
humorously, 
without 
any 
trace 
of 
ressentiment, 
and 
that 
he 
goes 
out 
of 
his 
way 
in 
the 
text 
above 
to 
voice 
his 
gratitude 
to 
von 
Bülow. 
Regarding 
Nietzsche’s 
relationship 
to 
Wagner’s 
music, 
Love 
is 
surely 
right 
in 
not 
regarding 
Nietzsche’s 
break 
with 
Wagner 
as 
an 
act 
of 
self-
betrayal 
(as 
many 
Wagnerians 
have 
done), 
concluding 
instead 
that 
“Nietzsche’s 
infatuation 
with 
Wagnerian 
music 
… 
may 
indeed 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
aberration” 
from 
his 
own 
line. 
But 
again 
it 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
Nietzsche 
makes 
a 
point 
of 
speaking 
of 
Wagner 
without 
ressentiment 
and 
with 
gratitude; 
and 
it 
is 
obviously 
possible 
to 
have 
more 
opportunities 
to 
hear 
Die 
Meistersinger 
and 
even, 
whether 
this 
is 
true 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
case 
or 
not, 
to 
know 
and 
in 
some 
sense 
like 
this 
opera 
especially 
well, 
while 
yet 
considering 
Tristan 
“Wagner’s 
non 
plus 
ultra.” 
Nietzsche’s 
judgments 
in 
Ecce 
Homo 
are 
plainly 
highly 
stylized: 
he 
loves 
Wagner—in 
spite 
of 
his 
Teutonomania, 
in 
spite 
of 
his 
ideas 
and 
his 
self-image, 
in 
spite 
of 
everything 
that 
eventually 
endeared 
him 
to 
his 
countrymen; 
he 
loves 
Wagner 
as 
the 
ultimate 
in 
decadence, 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
apotheosis 
of 
French 
romanticism, 
as 
fascinatingly 
sick—and 
Tristan 
fits 
into 
that 
picture 
a 
thousand 
times 
better 
than 
Die 
Meistersinger.

Nietzsche 
spent

in

his 
winters 
in 
Italy, 
and 
wrote 
Ecce

in 
Turin.

Heinrich 
Köselitz, 
a 
young 
composer 
who 
vastly 
admired 
Nietzsche, 
helped 
him 
prepare 
copies 
of 
his 
manuscripts 
for 
the 
printer, 
read 
proofs 
for 
him, 
and 
assisted 
him 
very 
devotedly. 
Nietzsche 
called 
him 
Peter 
Gast, 
and 
this 
became 
his 
pen 
name 
when 
he 
later 
became 
one 
of 
the 
editors 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
works. 
His 
opera, 
“The 
Lion 
of 
Venice,” 
never 
made 
a 
reputation 
for 
him 
as 
a 
composer, 
but 
Nietzsche’s 
letters 
to 
Gast 
(1908) 
made 
him 
famous. 
His 
own 
letters 
to 
Nietzsche 
(2 
vols., 
1923–24) 
are 
much 
less 
interesting 
and 
not 
at 
all 
widely 
known. 
The 
passage 
in 
the 
text 
is 
plainly 
inspired 
by 
gratitude 
and 
to 
that 
extent 
offers 
a 
clue 
to 
some 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
other 
judgments 
in 
Ecce 
Homo: 
he 
is 
often 
more 
concerned 
with 
his 
own 
attitudes 
and 
their 
fittingness, 
their 
style, 
than 
with 
their 
literal 
content.

ardent 
Bemühn

and 
points 
out 
that 
the 
spiral 
scribble 
used 
to 
delete 
the 
following 
passage 
at 
this 
point 
was 



characteristic 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
sister 
and 
never 
employed 
by 
him 
(p. 
408; 
cf. 
also 
pp. 
245f.). 
“Our 
present 
culture 
is 
ambiguous 
in 
the 
highest 
degree.— 
The 
German 
emperor 
making 
a 
pact 
with 
the 
pope, 
as 
if 
the 
pope 
were 
not 
the 
representative 
of 
deadly 
hostility 
to 
life!— 
What 
is 
being 
built 
today 
will 
no 
longer 
stand 
in 
three 
years.— 
When 
I 
measure 
myself 
against 
my 
ability, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
what 
will 
come 
after 
me, 
a 
collapse, 
a 
construction 
without 
equal, 
then 
I 
more 
than 
any 
other 
mortal 
have 
a 
claim 
to 
the 
epithet 
of 
greatness.” 
In 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
(1908) 
this 
paragraph 
was 
printed 
in 
a 
footnote 
in 
Raoul 
Richter’s 
postscript 
(pp. 
147f.) 
and 
introduced 
with 
the 
following 
comment: 
“There 
are 
only 
two 
passages 
of 
any 
length 
where 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
the 
crossing 
out 
and 
Peter 
Gast’s 
testimony, 
based 
on 
his 
recollection, 
make 
it 
merely 
probable 
that 
the 
deletion 
was 
Nietzsche’s 
own.” 
The 
other 
passage 
will 
be 
found 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
discussion 
of 
“The 
Case 
of 
Wagner,” 
below. 


2 
Pathetisch 
in 
German 
is 
closer 
in 
meaning 
to 
bombastic 
than 
it 
is 
to 
pitiful. 
The 
word 
is 
readily 
associated 
with 
an 
actor’s 
style 
and 
with 
highly 
idealistic 
passages 
in 
drama—in 
Schiller’s 
plays, 
for 
example— 
where 
big 
words 
are 
used 
freely 
and 
a 
laugh 
would 
puncture 
the 
whole 
effect. 
The 
same 
consideration 
applies 
to 
Pathos 
in 
the 
next 
sentence. 
One 
may 
wonder 
whether 
this 
whole 
paragraph 
is 
starkly 
ironical 
or, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
totally 
lacking 
in 
self-awareness. 
Without 
denying 
that 
both 
alternatives 
contain 
a 
grain 
of 
truth, 
one 
may 
insist 
that 
Nietzsche’s 
central 
point 
is 
important. 
He 
never 
lost 
the 
ability 
to 
laugh, 
and 
his 
self-
image 
was 
the 
very 
antithesis 
of 
his 
sister’s 
later 
image 
of 
him 
which, 
at 
her 
bidding, 
was 
translated 
into 
pictures 
and 
sculptures 
that 
she 
commissioned 
and 
for 
which 
she 
posed 
her 
brother 
who 
was 
by 
then 
a 
helpless 
invalid. 
Finally, 
if 
we 
take 
seriously 
Nietzsche’s 
words, 
“not 
a 
moment 
in 
my 
life”—as 
distinguished 
from 
“not 
a 
line 
in 
this 
book”—he 
is 
incontestably 
right. 
Consider 
how 
Dr. 
Paneth, 
one 
of 
Freud’s 
friends, 
described 
Nietzsche 
of 
whom 
he 
saw 
a 
great 
deal 
in 
Nizza 
from 
December 
26, 
1883, 
until 
March 
26, 
1884: 
“There 
is 
not 
a 
trace 
of 
false 
pathos 
or 
the 
prophet’s 
pose 
in 
him, 
as 
I 
had 
rather 
feared 
after 
his 
last 
work. 
Instead 
his 
manner 
is 
completely 
inoffensive 
and 
natural.… 
He 
told 
me, 
but 
without 
the 
least 
affectation 
or 
conceit, 
that 
he 
always 
felt 



himself 
to 
have 
a 
task 
…”

Die 
kein 
Mensch 
mir 
nachmacht—oder 
vormacht 
… 
If 
Nietzsche 
meant—and 
this 
possibility 
cannot 
be 
ruled 
out—“or 
has 
done 
before 
me,” 
the 
text 
ought 
to 
read: 
oder 
mir 
vorgemacht 
hat. 


4 
Love 
of 
fate. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
how 
Ecce 
Homo 
exemplifies 
this 
attitude. 
As 
long 
as 
one 
overlooks 
this, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
fact 
that 
Nietzsche’s 
life 
for 
the 
preceding 
decade, 
and 
more, 
had 
been 
troubled 
by 
continued 
ill 
health 
and 
excruciating 
physical 
pain, 
and 
that 
his 
books 
were, 
without 
exception, 
totally 
“unsuccessful,” 
one 
does 
not 
begin 
to 
understand 
Ecce 
Homo. 



Why 
I 
Write 
Such 
Good 
Books 



1 


I 
am 
one 
thing, 
my 
writings 
are 
another 
matter.— 
Before 
I 
discuss 
them, 
one 
by 
one, 
let 
me 
touch 
on 
the 
question 
of 
their 
being 
understood 
or 
not 
understood. 
I’ll 
do 
it 
as 
casually 
as 
decency 
permits; 
for 
the 
time 
for 
this 
question 
certainly 
hasn’t 
come 
yet. 
The 
time 
for 
me 
hasn’t 
come 
yet: 
some 
are 
born 
posthumously. 


Some 
day 
institutions 
will 
be 
needed 
in 
which 
men 
live 
and 
teach 
as 
I 
conceive 
of 
living 
and 
teaching; 
it 
might 
even 
happen 
that 
a 
few 
chairs 
will 
then 
be 
set 
aside 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
Zarathustra. 
But 
it 
would 
contradict 
my 
character 
entirely 
if 
I 
expected 
ears 
and 
hands 
for 
my 
truths 
today: 
that 
today 
one 
doesn’t 
hear 
me 
and 
doesn’t 
accept 
my 
ideas 
is 
not 
only 
understandable, 
it 
even 
seems 
right 
to 
me. 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
be 
confounded 
with 
others—not 
even 
by 
myself. 


To 
repeat, 
one 
cannot 
find 
many 
traces 
of 
ill 
will 
in 
my 
life; 
and 
of 
literary 
ill 
will, 
too, 
I 
could 
scarcely 
relate 
a 
single 
case. 
But 
only 
too 
many 
of 
pure 
foolishness! 


To 
me 
it 
seems 
one 
of 
the 
rarest 
distinctions 
that 
a 
man 
can 
accord 
himself 
if 
he 
takes 
one 
of 
my 
books 
into 
his 
hands—I 
even 
suppose 
that 
he 
first 
takes 
off 
his 
shoes,1 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
boots. 


When 
Dr. 
Heinrich 
von 
Stein 
once 
complained 
very 
honestly 
that 
he 
didn’t 
understand 
a 
word 
of 
my 
Zarathustra, 
I 
told 
him 
that 
this 
was 
perfectly 
in 
order: 
having 
understood 
six 
sentences 
from 
it—that 
is, 
to 
have 
really 
experienced 
them—would 
raise 
one 
to 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
existence 
than 
“modern” 
men 
could 
attain. 
Given 
this 
feeling 
of 
distance, 
how 
could 
I 
possibly 
wish 
to 
be 
read 
by 
those 
“moderns” 
whom 
I 
know! 


My 
triumph 
is 
precisely 
the 
opposite 
of 
Schopenhauer’s: 
I 
say, 
“non 
legor, 
non 
legar.”2 


Not 
that 
I 
should 
like 
to 
underestimate 
the 
pleasure 
I 
have 
felt 
on 
several 
occasions 
at 
the 
innocence 
of 
people 
who 
said 
No 
to 
my 
writings. 
Only 
this 
past 
summer, 
at 
a 
time 
when 
I 
may 
have 
upset 
the 
balance 
of 
the 
whole 
rest 
of 
literature 
with 
my 
weighty, 
too 
weighty, 
literature, 
a 
professor 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Berlin 
suggested 
very 
amiably 
that 
I 
ought 
to 
try 
another 
form: 



nobody 
read 
such 
things. 


In 
the 
last 
analysis, 
it 
was 
not 
Germany 
but 
Switzerland 
that 
produced 
the 
two 
extreme 
cases. 
An 
essay 
by 
Dr. 
V. 
Widmann 
in 
the 
Bund, 
about 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
under 
the 
title 
“Nietzsche’s 
Dangerous 
Book,” 
and 
a 
comprehensive 
report 
about 
my 
books 
in 
general 
by 
Karl 
Spitteler,3 
also 
in 
the 
Bund, 
represent 
a 
maximum 
in 
my 
life—I 
refrain 
from 
saying, 
of 
what. 


The 
latter 
treated 
my 
Zarathustra, 
for 
example, 
as 
an 
advanced 
exercise 
in 
style, 
and 
expressed 
the 
wish 
that 
later 
on 
I 
might 
provide 
some 
content 
as 
well. 
Dr. 
Widmann 
expressed 
his 
respect 
for 
the 
courage 
I 
had 
shown 
in 
my 
attempt 
to 
abolish 
all 
decent 
feelings.4 


As 
the 
petty 
spite 
of 
accident 
would 
have 
it, 
every 
sentence 
in 
this 
latter 
piece 
was, 
with 
a 
consistency 
I 
admired, 
some 
truth 
stood 
on 
its 
head: 
one 
really 
had 
to 
do 
no 
more 
than 
“revalue 
all 
values” 
in 
order 
to 
hit 
the 
nail 
on 
the 
head 
about 
me 
in 
a 
truly 
remarkable 
manner—instead 
of 
hitting 
my 
head 
with 
a 
nail.— 
That 
makes 
an 
explanation 
only 
more 
desirable. 


Ultimately, 
nobody 
can 
get 
more 
out 
of 
things, 
including 
books, 
than 
he 
already 
knows. 
For 
what 
one 
lacks 
access 
to 
from 
experience 
one 
will 
have 
no 
ear. 
Now 
let 
us 
imagine 
an 
extreme 
case: 
that 
a 
book 
speaks 
of 
nothing 
but 
events 
that 
lie 
altogether 
beyond 
the 
possibility 
of 
any 
frequent 
or 
even 
rare 
experience—that 
it 
is 
the 
first 
language 
for 
a 
new 
series 
of 
experiences. 
In 
that 
case, 
simply 
nothing 
will 
be 
heard, 
but 
there 
will 
be 
the 
acoustic 
illusion 
that 
where 
nothing 
is 
heard, 
nothing 
is 
there. 


This 
is, 
in 
the 
end, 
my 
average 
experience 
and, 
if 
you 
will, 
the 
originality 
of 
my 
experience. 
Whoever 
thought 
he 
had 
understood 
something 
of 
me, 
had 
made 
up 
something 
out 
of 
me 
after 
his 
own 
image—not 
uncommonly 
an 
antithesis 
to 
me; 
for 
example, 
an 
“idealist”—and 
whoever 
had 
understood 
nothing 
of 
me, 
denied 
that 
I 
need 
be 
considered 
at 
all. 


The 
word 
“overman,” 
as 
the 
designation 
of 
a 
type 
of 
supreme 
achievement, 
as 
opposed 
to 
“modern” 
men, 
to 
“good” 
men, 
to 
Christians 
and 
other 
nihilists 
—a 
word 
that 
in 
the 
mouth 
of 
a 
Zarathustra, 
the 
annihilator 
of 
morality, 
becomes 
a 
very 
pensive 
word—has 
been 
understood 
almost 
everywhere 
with 
the 
utmost 
innocence 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
those 
very 
values 
whose 
opposite 
Zarathustra 
was 
meant 
to 
represent—that 
is, 
as 
an 
“idealistic” 
type 
of 
a 
higher 
kind 
of 
man, 
half 
“saint,” 
half 
“genius.” 


Other 
scholarly 
oxen 
have 
suspected 
me 
of 
Darwinism 
on 
that 
account. 
Even 
the 
“hero 
worship” 
of 
that 
unconscious 
and 
involuntary 
conterfeiter, 
Carlyle, 
which 
I 
have 
repudiated 
so 
maliciously, 
has 
been 
read 
into 
it. 
Those 



to 
whom 
I 
said 
in 
confidence 
that 
they 
should 
sooner 
look 
even 
for 
a 
Cesare 
Borgia 
than 
for 
a 
Parsifal, 
did 
not 
believe 
their 
own 
ears.5 


That 
I 
feel 
no 
curiosity 
at 
all 
about 
reviews 
of 
my 
books, 
especially 
in 
newspapers, 
should 
be 
forgiven 
me. 
My 
friends 
and 
my 
publishers 
know 
this 
and 
do 
not 
speak 
to 
me 
about 
such 
things. 
In 
one 
particular 
case 
I 
once 
did 
get 
to 
see 
all 
the 
sins 
that 
had 
been 
committed 
against 
one 
of 
my 
books—it 
was 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil—and 
I 
could 
make 
a 
pretty 
report 
about 
that. 
Would 
you 
believe 
it? 
The 
Nationalzeitung—a 
Prussian 
newspaper, 
as 
I 
might 
explain 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
my 
foreign 
readers—I 
myself 
read, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so, 
only 
the 
Journal 
des 
Débats—actually 
managed 
to 
understand 
the 
book 
as 
a 
“sign 
of 
the 
times,” 
as 
the 
real 
and 
genuine 
Junker 
philosophy 
for 
which 
the 
Kreuzzeitung6 
merely 
lacked 
the 
courage. 



2 


This 
was 
said 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
Germans; 
for 
everywhere 
else 
I 
have 
readers—nothing 
but 
first-rate 
intellects 
and 
proven 
characters, 
trained 
in 
high 
positions 
and 
duties; 
I 
even 
have 
real 
geniuses 
among 
my 
readers. 
In 
Vienna, 
in 
St. 
Petersburg, 
in 
Stockholm, 
in 
Copenhagen, 
in 
Paris, 
in 
New 
York—everywhere 
I 
have 
been 
discovered; 
but 
not 
in 
the 
shallows 
of 
Europe, 
Germany.1 


And 
let 
me 
confess 
that 
my 
nonreaders 
delight 
me 
even 
more—those 
who 
have 
never 
heard 
my 
name, 
nor 
the 
word 
“philosophy.” 
But 
wherever 
I 
go, 
here 
in 
Turin, 
for 
example, 
everybody’s 
face 
lights 
up 
and 
looks 
pleased 
at 
my 
sight. 
What 
has 
flattered 
me 
most 
so 
far 
is 
that 
old 
costermonger 
women 
won’t 
relax 
until 
they 
have 
found 
their 
sweetest 
grapes 
for 
me. 
That 
is 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
one 
should 
be 
a 
philosopher. 


It 
is 
not 
for 
nothing 
that 
the 
Poles 
are 
called 
the 
Frenchmen 
among 
the 
Slavs. 
A 
charming 
Russian 
woman 
would 
not 
doubt 
for 
a 
moment 
where 
I 
belong. 
I 
cannot 
be 
solemn, 
at 
most 
I 
become 
embarrassed. 


To 
think 
German, 
to 
feel 
German—I 
can 
do 
anything, 
but 
not 
that. 


My 
old 
teacher, 
Ritschl, 
actually 
claimed 
that 
I 
planned 
even 
my 
philological 
essays 
like 
a 
Parisian 
romancier—absurdly 
exciting. 
Even 
in 
Paris 
they 
are 
amazed 
by 
“tout 
mes 
audaces 
et 
finesses”—this 
is 
M. 
Taine’s 
expression.2 
I 
fear 
that 
even 
into 
the 
highest 
forms 
of 
the 
dithyramb 
one 
finds 
in 
my 
case 
some 
admixture 
of 
that 
salt 
which 
never 
loses 
its 
savor 
and 
becomes 
flat—“German”—namely, 
esprit.— 
I 
cannot 
do 
otherwise. 
God 
help 
me! 
Amen.3 


All 
of 
us 
know, 
some 
even 
know 
from 
experience, 
which 
animal 
has 
long 
ears. 
Well 
then, 
I 
dare 
assert 
that 
I 
have 
the 
smallest 
ears. 
This 
is 
of 
no 
small 
interest 
to 
women—it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
they 
may 
feel 
I 
understand 
them 
better.— 
I 
am 
the 
anti-ass 
par 
excellence 
and 
thus 
a 
world-historical 
monster 
—I 
am, 
in 
Greek, 
and 
not 
only 
in 
Greek, 
the 
Antichrist. 



3 


I 
have 
some 
notion 
of 
my 
privileges 
as 
a 
writer; 
in 
a 
few 
instances 
I 
have 
been 
told, 
too, 
how 
getting 
used 
to 
my 
writings 
“spoils” 
one’s 
taste. 
One 
simply 
can 
no 
longer 
endure 
other 
books, 
least 
of 
all 
philosophical 
works. 
It 
is 
a 
distinction 
without 
equal 
to 
enter 
this 
noble 
and 
delicate 
world—one 
must 
not 
by 
any 
means 
be 
a 
German; 
it 
is 
after 
all 
a 
distinction 
one 
must 
have 
earned. 
But 
whoever 
is 
related 
to 
me 
in 
the 
height 
of 
his 
aspirations 
will 
experience 
veritable 
ecstasies 
of 
learning; 
for 
I 
come 
from 
heights 
that 
no 
bird 
ever 
reached 
in 
its 
flight, 
I 
know 
abysses 
into 
which 
no 
foot 
ever 
strayed. 
I 
have 
been 
told 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
put 
down 
one 
of 
my 
books—that 
I 
even 
disturb 
nightly 
rest. 


Altogether, 
there 
is 
no 
prouder 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
subtler 
type 
of 
book: 
here 
and 
there 
they 
achieve 
the 
highest 
thing 
achievable 
on 
earth, 
cynicism; 
they 
have 
to 
be 
conquered 
with 
the 
most 
delicate 
fingers 
as 
well 
as 
the 
bravest 
fists. 
Every 
frailty 
of 
the 
soul 
excludes 
one 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
even 
every 
kind 
of 
dyspepsia: 
one 
must 
not 
have 
any 
nerves, 
one 
needs 
a 
cheerful 
digestion. 
Not 
only 
the 
poverty, 
also 
the 
nook 
air 
of 
a 
soul 
excludes 
one; 
even 
more, 
any 
cowardice, 
uncleanliness, 
secret 
vengefulness 
in 
the 
entrails: 
a 
single 
word 
from 
me 
drives 
all 
his 
bad 
instincts 
into 
a 
man’s 
face. 
My 
acquaintances 
include 
several 
guinea 
pigs 
who 
illustrate 
for 
me 
different 
reactions 
to 
my 
writings—different 
in 
a 
very 
instructive 
manner. 
Those 
who 
want 
no 
part 
of 
the 
contents, 
my 
so-called 
friends, 
for 
example, 
become 
“impersonal”: 
they 
congratulate 
me 
for 
having 
got 
“that 
far” 
again—and 
find 
some 
progress 
in 
the 
greater 
cheerfulness 
of 
the 
tone. 


Utterly 
depraved 
“spirits,” 
“beautiful 
souls,” 
being 
mendacious 
through 
and 
through, 
simply 
do 
not 
know 
where 
they 
are 
with 
these 
books—hence 
they 
consider 
them 
beneath 
themselves, 
the 
beautiful 
consistency 
of 
all 
“beautiful 
souls.” 
The 
oxen 
among 
my 
acquaintances—mere 
Germans, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so—suggest 
that 
one 
cannot 
always 
agree 
with 
my 
opinions, 
but 
at 
times—This 
I 
have 
been 
told 
even 
about 
Zarathustra. 


All 
“feminism,” 
too—also 
in 
men—closes 
the 
door: 
it 
will 
never 
permit 
entrance 
into 
this 
labyrinth 
of 
audacious 
insights. 
One 
must 
never 
have 
spared 
oneself, 
one 
must 
have 
acquired 
hardness 
as 
a 
habit 
to 
be 
cheerful 
and 



in 
good 
spirits 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
nothing 
but 
hard 
truths. 
When 
I 
imagine 
a 
perfect 
reader, 
he 
always 
turns 
into 
a 
monster 
of 
courage 
and 
curiosity; 
moreover, 
supple, 
cunning, 
cautious; 
a 
born 
adventurer 
and 
discoverer. 
In 
the 
end, 
I 
could 
not 
say 
better 
to 
whom 
alone 
I 
am 
speaking 
at 
bottom 
than 
Zarathustra 
said 
it: 
to 
whom 
alone 
will 
he 
relate 
his 
riddle? 


“To 
you, 
the 
bold 
searchers, 
researchers, 
and 
whoever 
embarks 
with 
cunning 
sails 
on 
terrible 
seas—to 
you, 
drunk 
with 
riddles, 
glad 
of 
the 
twilight, 
whose 
soul 
flutes 
lure 
astray 
to 
every 
whirlpool, 
because 
you 
do 
not 
want 
to 
grope 
along 
a 
thread 
with 
cowardly 
hand; 
and 
where 
you 
can 
guess, 
you 
hate 
to 
deduce.”1 



4 


This 
is 
also 
the 
point 
for 
a 
general 
remark 
about 
my 
art 
of 
style. 
To 
communicate 
a 
state, 
an 
inward 
tension 
of 
pathos, 
by 
means 
of 
signs, 
including 
the 
tempo 
of 
these 
signs—that 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
every 
style;1 
and 
considering 
that 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
inward 
states 
is 
exceptionally 
large 
in 
my 
case, 
I 
have 
many 
stylistic 
possibilities—the 
most 
multifarious 
art 
of 
style 
that 
has 
ever 
been 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
one 
man. 
Good 
is 
any 
style 
that 
really 
communicates 
an 
inward 
state, 
that 
makes 
no 
mistake 
about 
the 
signs, 
the 
tempo 
of 
the 
signs, 
the 
gestures—all 
the 
laws 
about 
long 
periods 
are 
concerned 
with 
the 
art 
of 
gestures.2 
Here 
my 
instinct 
is 
infallible. 


Good 
style 
in 
itself—a 
pure 
folly, 
mere 
“idealism,” 
on 
a 
level 
with 
the 
“beautiful 
in 
itself,” 
the 
“good 
in 
itself,” 
the 
“thing 
in 
itself.” 


Always 
presupposing 
that 
there 
are 
ears—that 
there 
are 
those 
capable 
and 
worthy 
of 
the 
same 
pathos, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
lack 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
one 
may 
communicate 
oneself.— 
My 
Zarathustra, 
for 
example, 
is 
still 
looking 
for 
those—alas, 
it 
will 
have 
to 
keep 
looking 
for 
a 
long 
time 
yet!— 
One 
must 
be 
worthy 
of 
hearing 
him. 


And 
until 
then 
there 
will 
be 
nobody 
to 
understand 
the 
art 
that 
has 
been 
squandered 
here: 
nobody 
ever 
was 
in 
a 
position 
to 
squander 
more 
new, 
unheard-of 
artistic 
devices 
that 
had 
actually 
been 
created 
only 
for 
this 
purpose. 
That 
this 
was 
possible 
in 
German, 
of 
all 
languages, 
remained 
to 
be 
shown: 
I 
myself 
would 
have 
rejected 
any 
such 
notion 
most 
unhesitatingly 
before. 
Before 
me, 
it 
was 
not 
known 
what 
could 
be 
done 
with 
the 
German 
language—what 
could 
be 
done 
with 
language 
in 
general. 
The 
art 
of 
the 
great 
rhythm, 
the 
great 
style 
of 
long 
periods 
to 
express 
a 
tremendous 
up 
and 
down 
of 
sublime, 
of 
superhuman 
passion, 
was 
discovered 
only 
by 
me; 
with 
a 
dithyramb 
like 
the 
last 
one 
in 
the 
third 
part 
of 
Zarathustra, 
entitled 
“The 
Seven 
Seals,” 
I 
soared 
a 
thousand 
miles 
beyond 
what 
was 
called 
poetry 
hitherto. 



5 


That 
a 
psychologist 
without 
equal 
speaks 
from 
my 
writings, 
is 
perhaps 
the 
first 
insight 
reached 
by 
a 
good 
reader—a 
reader 
as 
I 
deserve 
him, 
who 
reads 
me 
the 
way 
good 
old 
philologists 
read 
their 
Horace. 
Those 
propositions 
on 
which 
all 
the 
world 
is 
really 
agreed—not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
world’s 
common 
run 
of 
philosophers, 
the 
moralists 
and 
other 
hollow 
pots, 
cabbage 
heads1—appear 
in 
my 
books 
as 
naïve 
blunders: 
for 
example, 
the 
belief 
that 
“unegoistic” 
and 
“egoistic” 
are 
opposites, 
while 
the 
ego 
itself 
is 
really 
only 
a 
“higher 
swindle,” 
an 
“ideal.”— 
There 
are 
neither 
egoistic 
nor 
unegoistic 
acts: 
both 
concepts 
are 
psychological 
absurdities. 
Or 
the 
proposition: 
“man 
strives 
for 
happiness.”— 
Or 
the 
proposition: 
“happiness 
is 
the 
reward 
of 
virtue.”— 
Or 
the 
proposition: 
“pleasure 
and 
displeasure 
are 
opposites.”— 
The 
Circe 
of 
humanity, 
morality, 
has 
falsified 
all 
psychologica 
through 
and 
through—moralizing 
them—down 
to 
that 
gruesome 
nonsense 
that 
love 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
something 
“unegoistic.”— 
One 
has 
to 
sit 
firmly 
upon 
oneself, 
one 
must 
stand 
bravely 
on 
one’s 
own 
two 
legs, 
otherwise 
one 
is 
simply 
incapable 
of 
loving. 
Ultimately, 
women 
know 
that 
only 
too 
well: 
they 
don’t 
give 
a 
damn 
about 
selfless, 
merely 
objective 
men. 


May 
I 
here 
venture 
the 
surmise 
that 
I 
know 
women? 
That 
is 
part 
of 
my 
Dionysian 
dowry. 
Who 
knows? 
Perhaps 
I 
am 
the 
first 
psychologist 
of 
the 
eternally 
feminine. 
They 
all 
love 
me—an 
old 
story—not 
counting 
abortive 
females, 
the 
“emancipated” 
who 
lack 
the 
stuff 
for 
children.— 
Fortunately, 
I 
am 
not 
willing 
to 
be 
torn 
to 
pieces: 
the 
perfect 
woman 
tears 
to 
pieces 
when 
she 
loves.— 
I 
know 
these 
charming 
maenads.— 
Ah, 
what 
a 
dangerous, 
creeping, 
subterranean 
little 
beast 
of 
prey 
she 
is! 
And 
yet 
so 
agreeable!— 
A 
little 
woman 
who 
pursues 
her 
revenge 
would 
run 
over 
fate 
itself.— 
Woman 
is 
indescribably 
more 
evil 
than 
man; 
also 
cleverer: 
good 
nature 
is 
in 
a 
woman 
a 
form 
of 
degeneration.— 
In 
all 
so-called 
“beautiful 
souls” 
something 
is 
physiologically 
askew 
at 
bottom; 
I 
do 
not 
say 
everything, 
else 
I 
should 
become 
medi-cynical. 
The 
fight 
for 
equal 
rights 
is 
actually 
a 
symptom 
of 
a 
disease: 
every 
physician 
knows 
that.— 
Woman, 
the 
more 
she 
is 
a 
woman, 
resists 
rights 
in 
general 
hand 
and 
foot: 
after 
all, 
the 
state 
of 
nature, 
the 
eternal 



war 
between 
the 
sexes, 
gives 
her 
by 
far 
the 
first 
rank. 


Has 
my 
definition 
of 
love 
been 
heard? 
It 
is 
the 
only 
one 
worthy 
of 
a 
philosopher. 
Love—in 
its 
means, 
war; 
at 
bottom, 
the 
deadly 
hatred 
of 
the 
sexes. 


Has 
my 
answer 
been 
heard 
to 
the 
question 
how 
one 
cures 
a 
woman 
—“redeems” 
her? 
One 
gives 
her 
a 
child. 
Woman 
needs 
children, 
a 
man 
is 
for 
her 
always 
only 
a 
means: 
thus 
spoke 
Zarathustra. 


“Emancipation 
of 
women”—that 
is 
the 
instinctive 
hatred 
of 
the 
abortive2 
woman, 
who 
is 
incapable 
of 
giving 
birth, 
against 
the 
woman 
who 
is 
turned 
out 
well3—the 
fight 
against 
the 
“man” 
is 
always 
a 
mere 
means, 
pretext, 
tactic. 
By 
raising 
themselves 
higher, 
as 
“woman 
in 
herself,” 
as 
the 
“higher 
woman,” 
as 
a 
female 
“idealist,” 
they 
want 
to 
lower 
the 
level 
of 
the 
general 
rank 
of 
woman; 
and 
there 
is 
no 
surer 
means 
for 
that 
than 
higher 
education, 
slacks, 
and 
political 
voting-cattle 
rights. 
At 
bottom, 
the 
emancipated 
are 
anarchists 
in 
the 
world 
of 
the 
“eternally 
feminine,” 
the 
underprivileged 
whose 
most 
fundamental 
instinct 
is 
revenge. 


One 
whole 
species 
of 
the 
most 
malignant 
“idealism”—which, 
incidentally, 
is 
also 
encountered 
among 
men; 
for 
example, 
in 
Henrik 
Ibsen, 
this 
typical 
old 
virgin—aims 
to 
poison 
the 
good 
conscience, 
what 
is 
natural 
in 
sexual 
love.4 


And 
lest 
I 
leave 
any 
doubt 
about 
my 
very 
decent 
and 
strict 
views 
in 
these 
matters, 
let 
me 
still 
cite 
a 
proposition 
against 
vice 
from 
my 
moral 
code: 
I 
use 
the 
word 
“vice” 
in 
my 
fight 
against 
every 
kind 
of 
antinature 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer 
pretty 
words, 
idealism. 
The 
proposition 
reads: 
“The 
preaching 
of 
chastity 
amounts 
to 
a 
public 
incitement 
to 
antinature. 
Every 
kind 
of 
contempt 
for 
sex, 
every 
impurification 
of 
it 
by 
means 
of 
the 
concept 
‘impure,’ 
is 
the 
crime 
par 
excellence 
against 
life—is 
the 
real 
sin 
against 
the 
holy 
spirit 
of 
life.” 



6 


To 
give 
an 
idea 
of 
me 
as 
a 
psychologist, 
I 
choose 
a 
curious 
bit 
of 


psychology 
from 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil; 
incidentally, 
I 
forbid 
any 
surmise 


about 
whom 
I 
am 
describing 
in 
this 
passage:1 


The 
genius 
of 
the 
heart, 
as 
that 
great 
concealed 
one 
possesses 
it, 
the 
tempter 
god 
and 
born 
pied 
piper 
of 
consciences 
whose 
voice 
knows 
how 
to 
descend 
into 
the 
netherworld 
of 
every 
soul; 
who 
does 
not 
say 
a 
word 
or 
cast 
a 
glance 
in 
which 
there 
is 
no 
consideration 
and 
ulterior 
enticement; 
whose 
mastery 
includes 
the 
knowledge 
of 
how 
to 
seem— 
not 
what 
he 
is 
but 
what 
is 
to 
those 
who 
follow 
him 
one 
more 
constraint 
to 
press 
ever 
closer 
to 
him 
in 
order 
to 
follow 
him 
even 
more 
inwardly 
and 
thoroughly—the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
who 
silences 
all 
that 
is 
loud 
and 
self-satisfied, 
teaching 
it 
to 
listen; 
who 
smooths 
rough 
souls 
and 
lets 
them 
taste 
a 
new 
desire—to 
lie 
still 
as 
a 
mirror, 
that 
the 
deep 
sky 
may 
mirror 
itself 
in 
them—the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
who 
teaches 
the 
doltish 
and 
rash 
hand 
to 
hesitate 
and 
reach 
out 
more 
delicately; 
who 
guesses 
the 
concealed 
and 
forgotten 
treasure, 
the 
drop 
of 
graciousness 
and 
sweet 
spirituality 
under 
dim 
and 
thick 
ice, 
and 
is 
a 
divining 
rod 
for 
every 
grain 
of 
gold 
that 
has 
long 
lain 
buried 
in 
the 
dungeon 
of 
much 
mud 
and 
sand; 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
heart 
from 
whose 
touch 
everyone 
walks 
away 
richer, 
not 
having 
received 
grace 
and 
surprised, 
not 
as 
blessed 
and 
oppressed 
by 
alien 
goods, 
but 
richer 
in 
himself, 
newer 
to 
himself 
than 
before, 
broken 
open, 
blown 
at 
and 
sounded 
out 
by 
a 
thawing 
wind, 
perhaps 
more 
unsure, 
tenderer, 
more 
fragile, 
more 
broken, 
but 
full 
of 
hopes 
that 
as 
yet 
have 
no 
name, 
full 
of 
new 
will 
and 
currents, 
full 
of 
new 
dissatisfaction 
and 
undertows 
…

J. 
V. 
Widmann 
(1842–1911) 
published 
his 
review 
in 
the 
Berner 



Bund 
on 
September 
16–17, 
1888. 
In 
the 
Encyclopedia 
of 
Poetry 
and 
Poetics, 
ed. 
Alex 
Preminger 
(Princeton, 
N. 
J., 
Princeton 
University 
Press, 
1965), 
Henri 
de 
Ziègler, 
former 
President 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Geneva, 
says 
of 
him 
in 
the 
article 
on 
“Swiss 
Poetry” 
(p. 
830): 
“A 
fascinating 
grace 
of 
expression—rare 
in 
German-Swiss 
literature— 
distinguishes 
the 
anachronistic 
verse-idylls 
of 
Spitteler’s 
friend 
J. 
V. 
Widmann.” 
Carl 
Spitteler 
(1845–1924) 
published 
the 
“comprehensive 
report,” 
mentioned 
in 
the 
text, 
in 
the 
New 
Year’s 
Supplement, 
1888, 
of 
the 
Bund. 
On 
November 
8, 
1888, 
he 
published 
a 
very 
favorable 
review 
of 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 
in 
the 
Bund. 
This 
book 
he 
also 
reviewed 
in 
Basler 
Nachrichten. 
Nietzsche 
was 
so 
pleased 
with 
Spitteler’s 
reaction 
to 
The 
Case 
of 
Wagner 
that 
he 
asked 
him 
to 
publish, 
with 
a 
preface, 
the 
passages 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
earlier 
books 
that 
Nietzsche 
then 
decided— 
even 
before 
Spitteler 
had 
had 
time 
to 
decline—to 
publish 
himself: 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner. 
In 
1908 
Spitteler 
published 
a 
small 
fifty-page 
pamphlet, 
Meine 
Beziehungen 
zu 
Nietzsche 
(my 
relations—or 
contacts 
—with 
Nietzsche; 
Munich, 
Süddeutsche 
Monatshefte). 
In 
Peter 
Gast’s 
notes 
on 
Nietzsche’s 
letters 
to 
him, 
February 
26, 
1888, 
and 
December 
16, 
1888, 
Gast 
took 
issue 
with 
Spitteler 
(Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Briefe 
an 
Peter 
Gast, 
Leipzig, 
1908, 
pp. 
503, 
517f.). 
In 
1919 
Spitteler 
received 
the 
Nobel 
Prize 
for 
literature. 
See 
also 
note 
4 
below.

At 
this 
point 
Nietzsche 
himself 
deleted 
the 
following 
passage 
in 
his 
MS: 
“Not 
that 
there 
was 
any 
lack 
of 
‘good 
will’ 
in 
either 
case; 
even 
less, 
of 
intelligence. 
Indeed, 
I 
consider 
Herr 
Spitteler 
one 
of 
the 
most 
welcome 
and 
refined 
of 
all 
who 
write 
criticism 
today; 
his 
work 
on 
the 
French 
drama—not 
published 
yet—may 
be 
of 
the 
first 
rank. 
That 
much 
more 
do 
I 
seek 
some 
explanation” 
(see 
Podach, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
p. 
249; 
and

Nietzsche’s 
instructions 
to 
delete 
these 
sentences,

250).

In 
a 
discarded 
draft 
for 
this 
passage 
we 
find 
the 
following 
(Podach, 
pp. 
254f.): 
“Whoever 
reads 
me 
in 
Germany 
today 
has 
first 
de



Germanized 
himself 
thoroughly, 
as 
I 
have 
done: 
my 
formula 
is 
known, 
‘to 
be 
a 
good 
German 
means 
to 
de-Germanize 
oneself’; 
or 
he 
is—no 
small 
distinction 
among 
Germans—of 
Jewish 
descent.— 
Jews 
among 
Germans 
are 
always 
the 
higher 
race—more 
refined, 
spiritual, 
kind.—

Heine,

This

suggests 
some 
of 
the 
difficulties 
faced 
by 
a 
translator 
of 
Nietzsche.

It 
seems 
plain 
that 
Nietzsche 
did 
not 
know 
most 
of 
Ibsen’s 
plays. 
Cf.

edition 
of 
The 
Will 
to 
Power 
(New 
York, 
Random

1967), 
sections

(including 
my 
long 
note) 
and 
747,

Section 
295. 
In 
a 
footnote 
for 
that 
section 
(in 
my 
translation 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil) 
I 
have 
brought 
together 
materials 
that 
show 
how 
much 
this 
portrait 
owes 
to 
Socrates: 
also 
how 
Nietzsche 
came 
to 
see 
himself 
this 
way. 
“I 
forbid 
any 
surmise 
…” 
surely 
suggests 
that 
the 
description 
seems 
to 
Nietzsche 
to 
fit 
himself. 



The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 



1 


To 
be 
fair 
to 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
(1872), 
one 
has 
to 
forget 
a 
few 
things. 
Its 
effect 
and 
fascination 
were 
due 
to 
what 
was 
wrong 
with 
it—its 
practical 
application 
to 
Wagnerism, 
as 
if 
that 
were 
a 
symptom 
of 
ascent. 
In 
this 
respect, 
this 
essay 
was 
an 
event 
in 
the 
life 
of 
Wagner: 
it 
was 
only 
from 
that 
moment 
on 
that 
Wagner’s 
name 
elicited 
high 
hopes. 
People 
still 
remind 
me 
of 
this 
today, 
sometimes 
even 
in 
the 
context 
of 
Parsifal—how 
I 
am 
the 
one 
who 
has 
it 
on 
his 
conscience 
that 
such 
a 
high 
opinion 
of 
the 
cultural 
value 
of 
this 
movement 
gained 
prevalence. 


Several 
times 
I 
saw 
this 
book 
cited 
as 
“The 
Re-Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
Out 
of 
the 
Spirit 
of 
Music”: 
what 
people 
had 
ears 
for 
was 
only 
a 
new 
formula 
for 
the 
art, 
the 
intentions, 
the 
task 
of 
Wagner—and 
what 
was 
really 
valuable 
in 
the 
essay 
was 
ignored. 
“Hellenism 
and 
Pessimism” 
would 
have 
been 
a 
less 
ambiguous 
title—suggesting 
the 
first 
instruction 
about 
how 
the 
Greeks 
got 
over 
their 
pessimism, 
how 
they 
overcame 
it. 


Precisely 
their 
tragedies 
prove 
that 
the 
Greeks 
were 
not 
pessimists: 
Schopenhauer 
went 
wrong 
at 
this 
point, 
as 
he 
went 
wrong 
everywhere. 


Taken 
up 
with 
some 
degree 
of 
neutrality, 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy 
looks 
quite 
untimely: 
one 
would 
never 
dream 
that 
it 
was 
begun 
amid 
the 
thunder 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Wörth. 
Before 
the 
walls 
of 
Metz, 
in 
cold 
September 
nights, 
while 
on 
duty 
as 
a 
medical 
orderly, 
I 
thought 
through 
these 
problems. 
One 
might 
sooner 
believe 
that 
the 
essay 
was 
fifty 
years 
older.1 
It 
is 
indifferent 
toward 
politics—“un-German,” 
to 
use 
the 
language 
of 
the 
present 
time—it 
smells 
offensively 
Hegelian, 
and 
the 
cadaverous 
perfume 
of 
Schopenhauer 
sticks 
only 
to 
a 
few 
formulas. 
An 
“idea”2—the 
antithesis3 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
and 
the 
Apollinian—translated 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
metaphysics; 
history 
itself 
as 
the 
development 
of 
this 
“idea”; 
in 
tragedy 
this 
antithesis 
is 
sublimated4 
into 
a 
unity; 
and 
in 
this 
perspective 
things 
that 
had 
never 
before 
faced 
each 
other 
are 
suddenly 
juxtaposed, 
used 
to 
illuminate 
each 
other, 
and 
comprehended5— 
opera, 
for 
example, 
and 
the 
revolution. 


The 
two 
decisive 
innovations 
of 
the 
book 
are, 
first, 
its 
understanding 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
phenomenon 
among 
the 
Greeks: 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
a 
psychological 



analysis 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
is 
offered, 
and 
it 
is 
considered 
as 
one 
root 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
Greek 
art. 
Secondly, 
there 
is 
the 
understanding 
of 
Socratism: 
Socrates 
is 
recognized 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
an 
instrument 
of 
Greek 
disintegration, 
as 
a 
typical 
decadent. 
“Rationality” 
against 
instinct. 
“Rationality” 
at 
any 
price 
as 
a 
dangerous 
force 
that 
undermines 
life.6 


Profound, 
hostile 
silence 
about 
Christianity 
throughout 
the 
book. 
That 
is 
neither 
Apollinian 
nor 
Dionysian; 
it 
negates 
all 
aesthetic 
values—the 
only 
values 
recognized 
in 
The 
Birth 
of 
Tragedy: 
it 
is 
nihilistic 
in 
the 
most 
profound 
sense, 
while 
in 
the 
Dionysian 
symbol 
the 
ultimate 
limit 
of 
affirmation 
is 
attained. 
There 
is 
one 
allusion 
to 
Christian 
priests 
as 
a 
“vicious 
kind 
of 
dwarfs” 
who 
are 
“subterranean.”7 



2 


This 
beginning 
is 
exceedingly 
strange. 
I 
had 
discovered 
the 
only 
parable 
and 
parallel 
in 
history 
for 
my 
own 
inmost 
experience 
—and 
thus 
became 
the 
first 
to 
comprehend 
the 
wonderful 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
Dionysian. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
my 
discovery 
that 
Socrates 
was 
a 
decadent 
proved 
unequivocally 
how 
little 
the 
sureness 
of 
my 
psychological 
grasp 
would 
be 
endangered 
by 
any 
moral 
idiosyncrasy: 
seeing 
morality 
itself 
as 
a 
symptom 
of 
decadence 
is 
an 
innovation 
and 
a 
singularity 
of 
the 
first 
rank 
in 
the 
history 
of 
knowledge. 
How 
high 
had 
I 
jumped 
with 
these 
two 
insights 
above 
the 
wretched 
and 
shallow 
chatter 
about 
optimism 
versus 
pessimism! 


I 
was 
the 
first 
to 
see1 
the 
real 
opposition: 
the 
degenerating 
instinct 
that 
turns 
against 
life 
with 
subterranean 
vengefulness 
(Christianity, 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Schopenhauer, 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
already 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Plato, 
and 
all 
of 
idealism 
as 
typical 
forms) 
versus 
a 
formula 
for 
the 
highest 
affirmation, 
born 
of 
fullness, 
of 
overfullness, 
a 
Yes-saying 
without 
reservation, 
even 
to 
suffering, 
even 
to 
guilt, 
even 
to 
everything 
that 
is 
questionable 
and 
strange 
in 
existence. 


This 
ultimate, 
most 
joyous, 
most 
wantonly 
extravagant 
Yes 
to 
life 
represents 
not 
only 
the 
highest 
insight 
but 
also 
the 
deepest, 
that 
which 
is 
most 
strictly 
confirmed 
and 
born 
out 
by 
truth 
and 
science. 
Nothing 
in 
existence 
may 
be 
subtracted, 
nothing 
is 
dispensable—those 
aspects 
of 
existence 
which 
Christians 
and 
other 
nihilists 
repudiate 
are 
actually 
on 
an 
infinitely 
higher 
level 
in 
the 
order 
of 
rank 
among 
values 
than 
that 
which 
the 
instinct 
of 
decadence 
could 
approve 
and 
call 
good.2 
To 
comprehend 
this 
requires 
courage 
and, 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
that, 
an 
excess 
of 
strength: 
for 
precisely 
as 
far 
as 
courage 
may 
venture 
forward, 
precisely 
according 
to 
that 
measure 
of 
strength 
one 
approaches 
the 
truth. 
Knowledge, 
saying 
Yes 
to 
reality, 
is 
just 
as 
necessary 
for 
the 
strong 
as 
cowardice 
and 
the 
flight 
from 
reality—as 
the 
“ideal” 
is 
for 
the 
weak, 
who 
are 
inspired 
by 
weakness. 


They 
are 
not 
free 
to 
know: 
the 
decadents 
need 
the 
lie—it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
their 
preservation. 


Whoever 
does 
not 
merely 
comprehend 
the 
word 
“Dionysian” 
but 



comprehends 
himself 
in 
the 
word 
“Dionysian” 
needs 
no 
refutation 
of 
Plato 
or 
Christianity 
or 
Schopenhauer—he 
smells 
the 
decay. 



3 


How 
I 
had 
thus 
found 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“tragic” 
and 
at 
long 
last 
knowledge 
of 
the 
psychology 
of 
tragedy, 
I 
have 
explained 
most 
recently 
in 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols, 
this 
page:1 


“Saying 
Yes 
to 
life 
even 
in 
its 
strangest 
and 
hardest 
problems; 
the 
will 
to 
life 
rejoicing 
over 
its 
own 
inexhaustibility 
even 
in 
the 
very 
sacrifice 
of 
its 
highest 
types—that 
is 
what 
I 
called 
Dionysian, 
that 
is 
what 
I 
understood 
as2 
the 
bridge 
to 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
tragic 
poet. 
Not 
in 
order 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
terror 
and 
pity, 
not 
in 
order 
to 
purge 
oneself 
of 
a 
dangerous 
affect 
by 
its 
vehement 
discharge—Aristotle 
misunderstood3 
it 
that 
way—but 
in 
order 
to 
be 
oneself 
the 
eternal 
joy 
of 
becoming, 
beyond 
all 
terror 
and 
pity—that 
joy 
which 
includes 
even 
joy 
in 
destroying.” 


In 
this 
sense 
I 
have 
the 
right 
to 
understand 
myself 
as 
the 
first 
tragic 
philosopher—that 
is, 
the 
most 
extreme 
opposite 
and 
antipode 
of 
a 
pessimistic 
philosopher. 
Before 
me 
this 
transposition 
of 
the 
Dionysian 
into 
a 
philosophical 
pathos 
did 
not 
exist: 
tragic 
wisdom 
was 
lacking; 
I 
have 
looked 
in 
vain 
for 
signs 
of 
it 
even 
among 
the 
great 
Greeks 
in 
philosophy, 
those 
of 
the 
two 
centuries 
before 
Socrates.4 
I 
retained 
some 
doubt 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Heraclitus, 
in 
whose 
proximity 
I 
feel 
altogether 
warmer 
and 
better 
than 
anywhere 
else. 
The 
affirmation 
of 
passing 
away 
and 
destroying, 
which 
is 
the 
decisive 
feature 
of 
a 
Dionysian 
philosophy; 
saying 
Yes 
to 
opposition 
and 
war; 
becoming, 
along 
with 
a 
radical 
repudiation 
of 
the 
very 
concept 
of 
being 
—all 
this 
is 
clearly 
more 
closely 
related 
to 
me 
than 
anything 
else 
thought 
to 
date. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
the 
“eternal 
recurrence,” 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
unconditional 
and 
infinitely 
repeated 
circular 
course 
of 
all 
things—this 
doctrine 
of 
Zarathustra 
might 
in 
the 
end 
have 
been 
taught 
already 
by 
Heraclitus. 
At 
least 
the 
Stoa 
has 
traces 
of 
it, 
and 
the 
Stoics 
inherited 
almost 
all 
of 
their 
principal 
notions 
from 
Heraclitus. 



4 


A 
tremendous 
hope 
speaks 
out 
of 
this 
essay. 
In 
the 
end 
I 
lack 
all 
reason 
to 
renounce 
the 
hope 
for 
a 
Dionysian 
future 
of 
music. 
Let 
us 
look 
ahead 
a 
century; 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
my 
attempt 
to 
assassinate 
two 
millennia 
of 
antinature 
and 
desecration 
of 
man 
were 
to 
succeed. 
That 
new 
party 
of 
life 
which 
would 
tackle 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
tasks, 
the 
attempt 
to 
raise 
humanity 
higher, 
including 
the 
relentless 
destruction 
of 
everything 
that 
was 
degenerating 
and 
parasitical, 
would 
again 
make 
possible 
that 
excess 
of 
life 
on 
earth 
from 
which 
the 
Dionysian 
state, 
too, 
would 
have 
to 
awaken 
again. 
I 
promise 
a 
tragic 
age: 
the 
highest 
art 
in 
saying 
Yes 
to 
life, 
tragedy, 
will 
be 
reborn 
when 
humanity 
has 
weathered 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
hardest 
but 
most 
necessary 
wars 
without 
suffering 
from 
it. 


A 
psychologist 
might 
still 
add 
that 
what 
I 
heard 
as 
a 
young 
man 
listening 
to 
Wagnerian 
music 
really 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
Wagner; 
that 
when 
I 
described 
Dionysian 
music 
I 
described 
what 
I 
had 
heard—that 
instinctively 
I 
had 
to 
transpose 
and 
transfigure 
everything 
into 
the 
new 
spirit 
that 
I 
carried 
in 
me. 
The 
proof 
of 
that, 
as 
strong 
as 
any 
proof 
can 
be, 
is 
my 
essay 
on 
Wagner 
in 
Bayreuth: 
in 
all 
psychologically 
decisive 
places 
I 
alone 
am 
discussed—and 
one 
need 
not 
hesitate 
to 
put 
down 
my 
name 
or 
the 
word 
“Zarathustra” 
where 
the 
text 
has 
the 
word 
“Wagner.” 
The 
entire 
picture 
of 
the 
dithyrambic 
artist 
is 
a 
picture 
of 
the 
pre-existent 
poet 
of 
Zarathustra, 
sketched 
with 
abysmal 
profundity 
and 
without 
touching 
even 
for 
a 
moment 
the 
Wagnerian 
reality. 
Wagner 
himself 
had 
some 
notion 
of 
that; 
he 
did 
not 
recognize 
himself 
in 
this 
essay. 


Similarly, 
“the 
idea 
of 
Bayreuth” 
was 
transformed 
into 
something 
that 
should 
not 
puzzle 
those 
who 
know 
my 
Zarathustra: 
into 
that 
great 
noon 
at 
which 
the 
most 
elect 
consecrate 
themselves 
for 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
tasks. 
Who 
could 
say? 
The 
vision 
of 
a 
feast 
that 
I 
shall 
yet 
live 
to 
see. 


The 
pathos 
of 
the 
first 
pages 
is 
world-historical; 
the 
glance 
spoken 
of 
on 
the 
seventh 
page 
is 
Zarathustra’s 
distinctive 
glance; 
Wagner, 
Bayreuth, 
the 
whole 
wretched 
German 
pettiness 
are 
a 
cloud 
in 
which 
an 
infinite 
mirage 
of 
the 
future 
is 
reflected. 
Even 
psychologically 
all 
decisive 
traits 
of 
my 
own 
nature 
are 
projected 
into 
Wagner’s—the 
close 
proximity 
of 
the 
brightest 
and 



the 
most 
calamitous 
forces, 
the 
will 
to 
power 
as 
no 
man 
ever 
possessed 
it,5 
the 
ruthless 
courage 
in 
matters 
of 
the 
spirit, 
the 
unlimited 
power 
to 
learn 
without 
damage 
to 
the 
will 
to 
act. 
Everything 
in 
this 
essay 
points 
to 
the 
future: 
the 
impending 
return 
of 
the 
Greek 
spirit, 
the 
necessity 
of 
counter-
Alexanders 
who 
will 
retie 
the 
Gordian 
knot 
of 
Greek 
culture. 


Listen 
to 
the 
world-historical 
accent 
with 
which 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
tragic 
attitude 
is 
introduced 
at 
the 
end 
of 
section 
4: 
this 
essay 
is 
full 
of 
world-
historical 
accents. 
This 
is 
the 
strangest 
“objectivity” 
possible: 
the 
absolute 
certainty 
about 
what 
I 
am 
was 
projected 
on 
some 
accidental 
reality—the 
truth 
about 
me 
spoke 
from 
some 
gruesome 
depth. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
section 
9 
the 
style 
of 
Zarathustra 
is 
described 
with 
incisive 
certainty 
and 
anticipated; 
and 
no 
more 
magnificent 
expression 
could 
be 
found 
for 
the 
event 
of 
Zarathustra, 
the 
act 
of 
a 
tremendous 
purification 
and 
consecration 
of 
humanity, 
than 
was

Aufgehoben: 
a

Hegel

because 
in 
ordinary

it 
can 
mean 
canceled, 
preserved, 
and 
lifted 
up.

This 
striking

the

has 
been 
ignored

quite 
apart 
from 
its 
human

The 
Untimely 
Ones1 



1 


The 
four 
Untimely 
Ones 
are 
certainly 
warlike. 
They 
prove 
that 
I 
was 
no 
Jack 
the 
Dreamer, 
that 
I 
take 
pleasure 
in 
fencing—perhaps 
also 
that 
I 
am 
dangerously 
quick 
at 
the 
draw. 
The 
first 
attack 
(1873) 
was 
directed 
against 
German 
“culture”2 
on 
which 
I 
looked 
down 
even 
then 
with 
ruthless 
contempt. 
Without 
meaning, 
without 
substance, 
without 
aim: 
mere 
“public 
opinion.” 
There 
is 
no 
more 
malignant 
misunderstanding 
than 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
great 
military 
success3 
of 
the 
Germans 
proved 
anything 
in 
favor 
of 
this 
“culture”— 
or, 
of 
all 
things, 
its 
triumph 
over 
France.

Die 
Unzeitgemässen: 
the 
four 
essays 
in 
question 
were 
published 
as 
Unzeitgemässe 
Betrachtungen 
(untimely 
meditations), 
one 
by 
one, 
with 
separate 
titles: 
David 
Strauss, 
The 
Confessor 
and 
Writer; 
On 
the 
Use 
and 
Disadvantage 
of 
History 
for 
Life; 
Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator; 
and 
Richard 
Wagner 
in 
Bayreuth. 


The 
second 
Untimely 
One 
(1874) 
brings 
to 
light 
what 
is 
dangerous 
and 
gnaws 
at 
and 
poisons 
life 
in 
our 
kind 
of 
traffic 
with 
science 
and 
scholarship4 
—how 
life 
is 
made 
sick 
by 
this 
dehumanized 
and 
mechanical 
grinding 
of 
gears, 
the 
“impersonality” 
of 
the 
laborer, 
the 
false 
economy 
of 
the 
“division 
of 
labor.” 
The 
aim 
is 
lost, 
genuine 
culture—and 
the 
means, 
the 
modern 
traffic 
with 
science, 
barbarized. 
In 
this 
essay 
the 
“historical 
sense” 
of 
which 
this 
century 
is 
proud 
was 
recognized 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
a 
disease, 
as 
a 
typical 
symptom 
of 
decay. 


In 
the 
third 
and 
fourth 
Untimely 
Ones, 
two 
images 
of 
the 
hardest 
self-love, 
self-discipline5 
are 
put 
up 
against 
all 
this, 
as 
pointers 
to 
a 
higher 
concept 
of 
culture, 
to 
restore 
the 
concept 
of 
culture—untimely 
types 
par 
excellence, 
full 
of 
sovereign 
contempt 
for 
everything 
around 
them 
that 
was 
called 
“Empire,” 
“culture,”6 
“Christianity,” 
“Bismarck,” 
“success”—Schopenhauer 
and 
Wagner 
or, 
in 
one 
word, 
Nietzsche. 



2 


Of 
these 
four 
attempts 
at 
assassination 
the 
first 
had 
an 
extraordinary 
success. 
The 
noise 
it 
evoked 
was 
in 
every 
sense 
splendid. 
I 
had 
touched 
the 
sore 
spot 
of 
a 
victorious 
nation—that 
its 
victory 
was 
not 
a 
cultural 
event 
but 
perhaps, 
perhaps 
something 
altogether 
different. 


The 
response 
came 
from 
all 
sides 
and 
by 
no 
means 
only 
from 
the 
old 
friends 
of 
David 
Strauss 
whom 
I 
had 
made 
ridiculous 
as 
a 
type 
of 
the 
German 
“cultural” 
philistine 
and 
satisfait,1 
in 
short 
as 
the 
author 
of 
his 
beer-hall 
gospel 
of 
The 
Old 
and 
the 
New 
Faith 
(the 
word 
Bildungsphilister 
has 
survived 
in 
the 
German 
language 
from 
my 
essay).2 
These 
old 
friends, 
Württembergers 
and 
Swabians 
whom 
I 
had 
wounded 
deeply 
when 
I 
found 
their 
prodigy, 
Strauss, 
funny, 
replied 
in 
such 
a 
foursquare 
and 
rude 
manner 
that 
I 
could 
not 
have 
asked 
for 
more; 
the 
replies 
from 
Prussia 
were 
more 
prudent—they 
had 
more 
Prussian, 
Berlin 
blue 
in 
them. 
It 
was 
a 
newspaper 
in 
Leipzig, 
the 
notorious 
Grenzboten, 
that 
became 
most 
indecent; 
I 
found 
it 
difficult 
to 
restrain 
the 
indignant 
Baselers 
from 
taking 
action. 
The 
only 
ones 
who 
decided 
unconditionally 
in 
my 
favor 
were 
a 
few 
old 
gentlemen, 
from 
mixed 
and 
in 
part 
undiscoverable 
motives. 
Ewald 
in 
Göttingen 
was 
among 
them;3 
he 
suggested 
my 
attempt 
had 
been 
fatal 
for 
Strauss. 
Also 
the 
old 
Hegelian, 
Bruno 
Bauer,4 
who 
was 
henceforth 
one 
of 
my 
most 
attentive 
readers. 
During 
his 
last 
years 
he 
liked 
to 
refer 
to 
me; 
for 
example, 
by 
giving 
Herr 
von 
Treitschke, 
the 
Prussian 
historiographer, 
a 
hint 
whom 
he 
might 
ask 
for 
some 
information 
about 
the 
concept 
of 
culture 
which 
had 
escaped 
him. 
Nothing 
written 
about 
this 
essay 
and 
its 
author 
was 
more 
thought-provoking 
or 
longer 
than 
what 
an 
old 
disciple 
of 
the 
philosopher 
von 
Baader5 
said, 
a 
Professor 
Hoffmann 
in 
Würzburg.6 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
essay 
he 
predicted 
a 
great 
destiny 
for 
me—bringing 
about 
a 
kind 
of 
crisis 
and 
ultimate 
decision 
in 
the 
problem 
of 
atheism 
whose 
most 
instinctive 
and 
relentless 
type 
he 
divined 
in 
me. 
It 
was 
atheism 
that 
led 
me 
to 
Schopenhauer. 


Nothing 
was 
heard 
as 
well 
or 
experienced 
as 
bitterly 
as 
an 
extraordinarily 
strong 
and 
courageous 
plea 
by 
the 
usually 
mild 
Karl 
Hillebrand, 
this 
last 
humane 
German 
who 
knew 
how 
to 
write. 
His 
piece 
was 
read 
in 
the 



Augsburger 
Zeitung; 
today 
it 
can 
be 
read, 
in 
a 
somewhat 
more 
cautious 
form, 
in 
his 
collected 
essays.7 
Here 
the 
essay 
was 
considered 
as 
an 
event, 
a 
turning 
point, 
a 
first 
self-examination, 
the 
very 
best 
sign, 
as 
a 
real 
return 
of 
German 
seriousness 
and 
German 
passion 
in 
matters 
of 
the 
spirit. 
Hillebrand 
was 
full 
of 
high 
praise 
for 
the 
form 
of 
the 
essay, 
for 
its 
mature 
taste, 
for 
its 
perfect 
tact 
in 
distinguishing 
between 
the 
person 
and 
the 
issue: 
he 
designated 
it 
as 
the 
best 
polemical 
essay 
written 
in 
German—in 
the 
art 
of 
polemics 
which 
is 
so 
dangerous 
and 
inadvisable 
for 
Germans. 
Saying 
Yes 
unconditionally, 
even 
sharpening 
the 
points 
I 
had 
dared 
to 
make 
against 
the 
galloping 
slovenliness 
of 
the 
German 
language8 
(today 
they 
play 
the 
purists 
and 
can 
no 
longer 
form 
a 
sentence), 
with 
equal 
contempt 
for 
the 
“foremost 
writers” 
of 
this 
nation, 
he 
concluded 
with 
an 
expression 
of 
his 
admiration 
for 
my 
courage—that 
“supreme 
courage 
which 
prefers 
charges 
precisely 
against 
the 
favorites 
of 
a 
people.” 


The 
aftereffects 
of 
this 
essay 
upon 
my 
life 
are 
virtually 
inestimable. 
Nobody 
so 
far 
has 
picked 
quarrels 
with 
me; 
in 
Germany 
I 
am 
treated 
with 
gloomy 
caution: 
for 
years 
I 
have 
made 
use 
of 
an 
unconditional 
freedom 
of 
speech 
for 
which 
nobody 
today, 
least 
of 
all 
in 
the 
Reich, 
has 
sufficient 
liberty. 
My 
paradise 
lies 
“in 
the 
shadow 
of 
my 
sword.” 


At 
bottom, 
I 
had 
put 
into 
practise 
one 
of 
Stendhal’s 
maxims: 
he 
advises 
men 
to 
make 
their 
entry 
into 
society 
with 
a 
duel. 
And 
how 
I 
had 
picked 
my 
opponent! 
the 
foremost 
German 
free 
spirit! 


Indeed, 
an 
altogether 
new 
type 
of 
free 
spirit 
thus 
gained 
his 
first 
expression: 
to 
this 
day 
nothing 
is 
more 
foreign 
and 
less 
related 
to 
me 
than 
the 
whole 
European 
and 
American 
species 
of 
libres 
penseurs.9 
I 
am 
much 
more 
profoundly 
at 
odds 
with 
them, 
as 
incorrigible 
blockheads 
and 
buffoons 
of 
“modern 
ideas,” 
than 
with 
any 
of 
their 
opponents. 
They 
also 
want 
in 
their 
own 
way 
to 
“improve” 
mankind, 
in 
their 
own 
image; 
against 
what 
I 
am, 
what 
I 
want, 
they 
would 
wage 
an 
irreconcilable 
war 
if 
they 
understood 
me: 
all 
of 
them 
still 
believe 
in 
the 
“ideal.”— 
I 
am 
the 
first 
immoralist. 



3 


That 
the 
two 
Untimely 
Ones 
distinguished 
by 
the 
names 
of 
Schopenhauer 
and 
Wagner 
contribute 
much 
to 
the 
understanding 
of, 
or 
even 
to 
the 
formulation 
of 
the 
proper 
psychological 
questions 
about, 
these 
two 
cases, 
I 
should 
not 
wish 
to 
assert—excepting, 
as 
seems 
fair, 
some 
details. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
the 
elementary 
fact 
in 
Wagner’s 
character 
is 
already 
designated 
with 
a 
profound 
sureness 
of 
instinct 
as 
an 
actor’s 
talent 
that 
merely 
explicates 
itself 
in 
his 
means 
and 
intentions. 


What 
I 
was 
fundamentally 
trying 
to 
do 
in 
these 
essays 
was 
something 
altogether 
different 
from 
psychology: 
an 
unequaled 
problem 
of 
education, 
a 
new 
concept 
of 
self-discipline, 
self-defense 
to 
the 
point 
of 
hardness, 
a 
way 
to 
greatness 
and 
world-historical 
tasks 
was 
seeking 
its 
first 
expression. 
Broadly 
speaking, 
I 
caught 
hold 
of 
two 
famous 
and 
as 
yet 
altogether 
undiagnosed 
types, 
as 
one 
catches 
hold 
of 
an 
opportunity, 
in 
order 
to 
say 
something, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
at 
hand 
a 
few 
more 
formulas, 
signs, 
means 
of 
language. 
This 
is 
really 
suggested 
with 
a 
perfectly 
uncanny 
sagacity 
near 
the 
end 
of 
section 
7 
in 
the 
third 
Untimely 
One. 
Plato 
employed 
Socrates 
in 
this 
fashion, 
as 
a 
[sign 
language 
for 
Plato].1 


Now 
that 
I 
am 
looking 
back 
from 
a 
certain 
distance 
upon 
the 
conditions 
of 
which 
these 
essays 
bear 
witness, 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
deny 
that 
at 
bottom 
they 
speak 
only 
of 
me. 
The 
essay 
Wagner 
in 
Bayreuth 
is 
a 
vision 
of 
my 
future, 
while 
in 
Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator 
my 
innermost 
history, 
my 
becoming, 
is 
inscribed. 
Above 
all, 
my 
promise! 


What 
I 
am 
today, 
where 
I 
am 
today—at 
a 
height 
where 
I 
speak 
no 
longer 
with 
words 
but 
with 
lightning 
bolts—ah, 
how 
remote 
from 
this 
I 
still 
was 
at 
that 
time!— 
But 
I 
beheld 
the 
land—I 
did 
not 
deceive 
myself 
for 
a 
moment 
about 
the 
way, 
the 
sea, 
the 
danger—and 
success. 
The 
great 
calm 
in 
promising, 
this 
happy 
gaze 
into 
a 
future 
that 
is 
not 
to 
remain 
a 
mere 
promise! 


Here 
every 
word 
is 
experienced, 
is 
deep, 
is 
inward; 
what 
is 
most 
painful 
is 
not 
lacking: 
there 
are 
words 
in 
it 
that 
are 
virtually 
bloodthirsty. 
But 
a 
wind 
of 
the 
great 
freedom 
blows 
over 
everything; 
even 
wounds 
do 
not 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
objections. 



How 
I 
understand 
the 
philosopher—as 
a 
terrible 
explosive, 
endangering 
everything—how 
my 
concept 
of 
the 
philosopher 
is 
worlds 
removed 
from 
any 
concept 
that 
would 
include 
even 
a 
Kant, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
academic 
“ruminants” 
and 
other 
professors 
of 
philosophy—this 
essay 
gives 
inestimable 
information 
about 
that, 
although 
at 
bottom 
it 
is 
admittedly 
not 
“Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator” 
that 
speaks 
here, 
but 
his 
opposite, 
“Nietzsche 
as 
Educator.” 


Considering 
that 
in 
those 
days 
I 
practiced 
the 
scholar’s 
craft, 
and 
perhaps 
knew 
something 
about 
this 
craft, 
the 
harsh 
psychology 
of 
the 
scholar 
that 
suddenly 
emerges 
in 
this 
essay 
is 
of 
some 
significance: 
it 
expresses 
the 
feeling 
of 
distance,2 
the 
profound 
assurance 
about 
what 
could 
be 
my 
task 
and 
what 
could 
only 
be 
means, 
entr’acte, 
and 
minor 
works. 
It 
shows 
my 
prudence 
that 
I 
was 
many 
things 
and 
in 
many 
places 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
become 
one 
thing—to 
be 
able 
to 
attain 
one 
thing. 
I 
had 
to 
be 
a 
scholar, 
too, 
for 
some 
time.3

Bildung 
has 
no 
exact 
equivalent 
in 
English: 
Bild 
means 
picture 
or 
image; 
bilden, 
to 
shape 
or 
form, 
but 
also 
to 
educate; 
ungebildet, 
uneducated, 
uncultured. 
In 
this

Bildung 
has 
been 
rendered 
by 
“culture” 
(in 
quotes), 
Kultur 
by

After 
this, 
science 
has 
been 
used 
to

Wissenschaft, 
but 
it 
should 
be 
kept 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
reference 
is 
not 
primarily 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences.

used 
there 
is 
also 
Selbstsucht. 
Cf. 
also 
Aristotle’s 
Nicomachean 
Ethics, 
1169a: 
“the 
good 
man 
ought 
to 
be 
a 
lover 
of 
self 
since 
he 
will 
then 
act 
nobly, 
and 
so 
both 
benefit 
himself

aid 
his

but 
the 
bad 
man 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
a 
lover 
of 
self, 
since 
he 
will 
follow 
his 
base 
passions, 
and 
so 
injure 
both 
himself 
and 
his 
neighbours”

The 
word 
had 
actually 
been 
used 
earlier 
by 
Gustav 
Teichmüller 
(1832–1888), 
a 
professor 
at 
Basel 
from 
1868 
to 
1871; 
but 
Nietzsche’s 
claim 
(ist 
von 
meiner 
Schrift 
her 
in 
der 
Sprache 
übriggeblieben) 
is 
literally 
true. 
For 
all 
that, 
he 
would 
hardly 
have 
said 
this 
if 
he 
had 
remembered 
that 
the 
coinage 
was 
Teichmüller’s.

Heinrich 
Ewald 
(1803–1875), 
a 
very 
eminent 
Old 
Testament 
scholar 
and 
orientalist, 
was 
one 
of 
the 
celebrated 
“Göttingen 
Seven” 
who 
in 
1837 
were 
expelled 
from 
the 
university 
because 
they 
had 
signed 
a 
liberal 
manifesto; 
he 
went 
to 
Tübingen, 
but 
returned 
to 
Göttingen 
in 
1848—and 
was 
pensioned 
off 
in 
1867 
because 
he 
refused 
to 
swear 
an 
oath 
of 
allegiance 
to 
the 
king 
of 
Prussia.

Bruno 
Bauer 
(1809–82) 
started 
out 
as 
a 
right-wing, 
conservative 
Hegelian 
and 
became 
a 
professor 
of 
theology 
at 
Bonn 
in 
1839. 
In 
1840 
and 
1841 
he 
published 
two 
volumes 
of 
New 
Testament 
criticism, 
and 
in 
1842 
he 
was 
deprived 
of 
the 
right 
to 
teach. 
Now 
he 
was 
accounted 
a 
“Young” 
or 
left-wing 
Hegelian, 
and 
he 
has 
been 
called 
“the 
most 
radical 
of 
the 
New 
Testament 
critics 
of 
his 
age.” 
He 
attacked 
David 
Friedrich 
Strauss’s 
ideas 
about 
the 
origins 
of 
Christianity 
and 
emphasized 
Hellenistic 
influences. 
Albert 
Schweitzer 
praised 
him 
highly 
in 
his 
Geschichte 
der 
Leben 
Jesu 
Forschung 
(Tübingen 
1921, 
p. 
161; 
The 
Quest 
of 
the 
Historical 
Jesus) 
for 
having 
assembled 
the 
most 
brilliant 
and 
complete 
summary 
of 
the 
difficulties 
presented 
by 
the 
life 
of 
Jesus. 
Marx’s 
and 
Engels’ 
attacks 
on 
Bauer, 
as 
“St. 
Bruno,”

included 
in 
Die 
Deutsche 
Ideologie 
(published 
posthumously 
in

ideas

The 
words 
placed 
in 
brackets 
are 
not 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
hand 
and 
were 
added 
by 
a 
German 
editor—presumably 
Gast. 
What 
Nietzsche 
claims 
may 
sound 
farfetched, 
but 
actually 
the 
first 
section 
of 
Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator 
makes 
this 
point 
very 
plainly. 
The 
question 
is 
raised 
how 
we 
can 
realize 
our 
true 
self, 
and 
the 
prescription 
is 
that 
we 
should 
ask 
ourselves: 
“What 
have 
you 
really 
loved 
till 
now?” 
For 
“your 
true 
self 
does 
not 
lie 
deeply 
concealed 
within 
you 
but 
immeasurably 
high 
above 
you, 
or 
at 
least 
above 
what 
you 
usually 
take 
for 
your 
ego. 
Your 
real 
educators, 
those/who 
formed 
you, 
reveal 
to 
you 
what 
is 
the 
true 
primary 
meaning 
and 
fundamental 
substance 
of 
your 
being 
…” 
The 
meditation 
on 
Schopenhauer 
is 
thus 
introduced 
as 
Nietzsche’s 
attempt 
to 
discover 
his 
own 
true 
self; 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
praise 
not 
only 
of 
Schopenhauer’s 
honesty 
but 
also—of 
all 
things—of 
his 
“cheerfulness” 
(in 
section 
2) 
points 
in 
the 
same 
direction.

Cf. 
ibid., 
section 
211: 
“It 
may 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
education 
of 
a 
genuine 
philosopher 
that 
he 
himself 
has 
also 
once 
stood 
on 
all 
these 
steps 
on 
which 
his 
servants, 
the 
scientific 
laborers 
of 
philosophy, 
remain 
standing 
…” 



Human, 
All-Too-Human 


With 
Two 
Sequels 



1 


Human, 
All-Too-Human 
is 
the 
monument 
of 
a 
crisis. 
It 
is 
subtitled 
“A 
Book 
for 
Free 
Spirits”: 
almost 
every 
sentence 
marks 
some 
victory—here 
I 
liberated 
myself 
from 
what 
in 
my 
nature 
did 
not 
belong 
to 
me. 
Idealism, 
for 
example; 
the 
title 
means: 
“where 
you 
see 
ideal 
things, 
I 
see 
what 
is—human, 
alas, 
alltoo-
human!”—I 
know 
man 
better. 


The 
term 
“free 
spirit” 
here 
is 
not 
to 
be 
understood 
in 
any 
other 
sense; 
it 
means 
a 
spirit 
that 
has 
become 
free,1 
that 
has 
again 
taken 
possession 
of 
itself. 
The 
tone, 
the 
voice, 
is 
completely 
changed: 
you 
will 
find 
the 
book 
clever, 
cool, 
perhaps 
hard 
and 
mocking. 
A 
certain 
spirituality 
of 
noble 
taste 
seems 
to 
be 
fighting 
continually 
against 
a 
more 
passionate 
current 
in 
order 
to 
stay 
afloat. 
In 
this 
connection 
it 
makes 
sense 
that 
it 
was 
actually 
the 
hundredth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
death 
of 
Voltaire 
that 
the 
book 
pleaded, 
as 
it 
were, 
as 
an 
excuse 
for 
coming 
out 
in 
1878.2 
For 
Voltaire 
was 
above 
all, 
in 
contrast 
to 
all 
who 
wrote 
after 
him, 
a 
grandseigneur3 
of 
the 
spirit—like 
me.— 
The 
name 
of 
Voltaire 
on 
one 
of 
my 
essays—that 
really 
meant 
progress—toward 
me. 


On 
closer 
inspection 
you 
discover 
a 
merciless 
spirit 
that 
knows 
all 
the 
hideouts 
where 
the 
ideal 
is 
at 
home—where 
it 
has 
its 
secret 
dungeons 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
its 
ultimate 
safety. 
With 
a 
torch 
whose 
light 
never 
wavers, 
an 
incisive 
light 
is 
thrown 
into 
this 
underworld 
of 
the 
ideal. 
This 
is 
war, 
but 
war 
without 
powder 
and 
smoke, 
without 
warlike 
poses, 
without 
pathos 
and 
strained 
limbs:4 
all 
that 
would 
still 
be 
“idealism.” 
One 
error 
after 
another 
is 
coolly 
placed 
on 
ice; 
the 
ideal 
is 
not 
refuted—it 
freezes 
to 
death.— 
Here, 
for 
example, 
“the 
genius” 
freezes 
to 
death; 
at 
the 
next 
corner, 
“the 
saint”; 
under 
a 
huge 
icicle, 
“the 
hero”; 
in 
the 
end, 
“faith,” 
so-called 
“conviction”; 
“pity” 
also 
cools 
down 
considerably—and 
almost 
everywhere 
“the 
thing 
in 
itself” 
freezes 
to 
death.

The 
beginnings 
of 
this 
book 
belong 
right 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
first 
Bayreuther 
Festspiele;1 
a 
profound 
alienation 
from 
everything 
that 
surrounded 
me 
there 
is 
one 
of 
its 
preconditions. 
Whoever 
has 
any 
notion 
of 
the 
visions 
I 
had 
encountered 
even 
before 
that, 
may 
guess 
how 
I 
felt 
when 
one 
day 
I 
woke 
up 
in 
Bayreuth. 
As 
if 
I 
were 
dreaming! 


Wherever 
was 
I? 
There 
was 
nothing 
I 
recognized; 
I 
scarcely 
recognized 
Wagner. 
In 
vain 
did 
I 
leaf 
through 
my 
memories. 
Tribschen—a 
distant 
isle 
of 
the 
blessed: 
not 
a 
trace 
of 
any 
similarity. 
The 
incomparable 
days 
when 
the 
foundation 
stone 
was 
laid, 
the 
small 
group 
of 
people 
that 
had 
belonged, 
had 
celebrated, 
and 
did 
not 
need 
first 
to 
acquire 
fingers 
for 
delicate 
matters—not 
a 
trace 
of 
any 
similarity. 
What 
had 
happened?— 
Wagner 
had 
been 
translated 
into 
German! 
The 
Wagnerian 
had 
become 
master 
over 
Wagner.— 
German 
art. 
The 
German 
master. 
German 
beer. 


We 
others, 
who 
know 
only 
too 
well 
to 
what 
subtle 
artists 
and 
what 
cosmopolitanism 
of 
taste 
Wagner’s 
art 
speaks, 
exclusively, 
were 
beside 
ourselves 
when 
we 
found 
Wagner 
again, 
draped 
with 
German 
“virtues.” 


I 
think 
I 
know 
the 
Wagnerians; 
I 
have 
experienced 
three 
generations, 
beginning 
with 
the 
late 
Brendel2 
who 
confounded 
Wagner 
and 
Hegel, 
down 
to 
the 
“idealists” 
of 
the 
Bayreuther 
Blätter3 
who 
confound 
Wagner 
and 
themselves—I 
have 
heard 
every 
kind 
of 
confession 
of 
“beautiful 
souls” 
about 
Wagner. 
A 
kingdom 
for 
one 
sensible 
word!— 
In 
truth, 
a 
hair-raising 
company! 
Nohl, 
Pohl, 
Kohl—droll 
with 
charm, 
in 
infinitum!4 
Not 
a 
single 
abortion 
is 
missing 
among 
them, 
not 
even 
the 
anti-Semite.— 
Poor 
Wagner! 
Where 
had 
he 
landed!— 
If 
he 
had 
at 
least 
entered 
into 
swine!5 
But 
to 
descend 
among 
Germans! 


Really, 
for 
the 
instruction 
of 
posterity 
one 
ought 
to 
stuff 
a 
genuine 
Bayreuther 
or, 
better 
yet, 
preserve 
him 
in 
spirits, 
for 
spirits 
are 
lacking—with 
the 
label: 
that 
is 
how 
the 
“spirit” 
looked 
on 
which 
the 
Reich 
was 
founded. 


Enough; 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
it 
I 
left 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
weeks,6 
very 
suddenly, 
although 
a 
charming 
Parisienne 
tried 
to 
console 
me; 
the 
only 
excuse 
I 
offered 
Wagner 
was 
a 
fatalistic 
telegram. 
In 
Klingenbrunn, 
a 
small 
town 
concealed 
in 



the 
woods 
of 
the 
Böhmerwald, 
I 
dragged 
around 
my 
melancholy 
and 
contempt 
for 
Germans 
like 
a 
disease—and 
from 
time 
to 
time 
I’d 
write 
a 
sentence 
into 
my 
notebook, 
under 
the 
general 
title 
“The 
Plowshare”—hard 
psychologica 
that 
can 
perhaps 
still 
be 
found 
in 
Human, 
All-Too-Human. 



3 


What 
reached 
a 
decision 
in 
me 
at 
that 
time 
was 
not 
a 
break 
with 
Wagner: 
I 
noted 
a 
total 
aberration 
of 
my 
instincts 
of 
which 
particular 
blunders, 
whether 
Wagner 
or 
the 
professorship 
at 
Basel, 
were 
mere 
symptoms. 
I 
was 
overcome 
by 
impatience 
with 
myself; 
I 
saw 
that 
it 
was 
high 
time 
for 
me 
to 
recall 
and 
reflect 
on 
myself. 
All 
at 
once 
it 
became 
clear 
to 
me 
in 
a 
terrifying 
way 
how 
much 
time 
I 
had 
already 
wasted—how 
useless 
and 
arbitrary 
my 
whole 
existence 
as 
a 
philologist 
appeared 
in 
relation 
to 
my 
task. 
I 
felt 
ashamed 
of 
this 
false 
modesty. 


Ten 
years 
lay 
behind 
me 
in 
which 
the 
nourishment 
of 
my 
spirit 
had 
really 
come 
to 
a 
stop; 
I 
had 
not 
learned 
anything 
new 
that 
was 
useful; 
I 
had 
forgotten 
an 
absurd 
amount 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
dusty 
scholarly 
gewgaws. 
Crawling 
scrupulously 
with 
bad 
eyes 
through 
ancient 
metrists—that’s 
what 
I 
had 
come 
to!— 
It 
stirred 
my 
compassion 
to 
see 
myself 
utterly 
emaciated, 
utterly 
starved: 
my 
knowledge 
simply 
failed 
to 
include 
realities, 
and 
my 
“idealities” 
were 
not 
worth 
a 
damn. 


A 
truly 
burning 
thirst 
took 
hold 
of 
me: 
henceforth 
I 
really 
pursued 
nothing 
more1 
than 
physiology, 
medicine, 
and 
natural 
sciences—and 
I 
did 
not 
return 
even 
to 
properly 
historical 
studies 
until 
my 
task 
compelled 
me 
to, 
imperiously. 
It 
was 
then, 
too, 
that 
I 
first 
guessed 
how 
an 
activity 
chosen 
in 
defiance 
of 
one’s 
instincts, 
a 
so-called 
“vocation” 
for 
which 
one 
does 
not 
have 
the 
least 
vocation, 
is 
related 
to 
the 
need 
for 
deadening 
the 
feeling 
of 
desolation 
and 
hunger 
by 
means 
of 
a 
narcotic 
art—for 
example, 
Wagnerian 
art. 


Looking 
about 
me 
cautiously, 
I 
have 
discovered 
that 
a 
large 
number 
of 
young 
men 
experience 
the 
same 
distress: 
one 
antinatural 
step 
virtually 
compels 
the 
second. 
In 
Germany, 
in 
the 
Reich—to 
speak 
unambiguously—all 
too 
many 
are 
condemned 
to 
choose 
vocations 
too 
early, 
and 
then 
to 
waste 
away 
under 
a 
burden 
they 
can 
no 
longer 
shake 
off.— 
These 
people 
require 
Wagner 
as 
an 
opiate: 
they 
forget 
themselves, 
they 
are 
rid 
of 
themselves 
for 
a 
moment.— 
What 
am 
I 
saying? 
For 
five 
or 
six 
hours! 



4 


It 
was 
then 
that 
my 
instinct 
made 
its 
inexorable 
decision 
against 
any 
longer 
yielding, 
going 
along, 
and 
confounding 
myself. 
Any 
kind 
of 
life, 
the 
most 
unfavorable 
conditions, 
sickness, 
poverty—anything 
seemed 
preferable 
to 
that 
unseemly 
“selflessness” 
into 
which 
I 
had 
got 
myself 
originally 
in 
ignorance 
and 
youth 
and 
in 
which 
I 
had 
got 
stuck 
later 
on 
from 
inertia 
and 
so-
called 
“sense 
of 
duty.”1 


Here 
it 
happened 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
I 
cannot 
admire 
sufficiently 
that, 
precisely 
at 
the 
right 
time, 
my 
father’s 
wicked 
heritage 
came 
to 
my 
aid—at 
bottom, 
predestination 
to 
an 
early 
death.2 
Sickness 
detached 
me 
slowly: 
it 
spared 
me 
any 
break, 
any 
violent 
and 
offensive 
step. 
Thus 
I 
did 
not 
lose 
any 
good 
will 
and 
actually 
gained 
not 
a 
little. 
My 
sickness 
also 
gave 
me 
the 
right 
to 
change 
all 
my 
habits 
completely; 
it 
permitted, 
it 
commanded 
me 
to 
forget; 
it 
bestowed 
on 
me 
the 
necessity 
of 
lying 
still, 
of 
leisure, 
of 
waiting 
and 
being 
patient.— 
But 
that 
means, 
of 
thinking.— 
My 
eyes 
alone 
put 
an 
end 
to 
all 
bookwormishness—in 
brief, 
philology: 
I 
was 
delivered 
from 
the 
“book”; 
for 
years 
I 
did 
not 
read 
a 
thing—the 
greatest 
benefit 
I 
ever 
conferred 
on 
myself. 


— 
That 
nethermost 
self 
which 
had, 
as 
it 
were, 
been 
buried 
and 
grown 
silent 
under 
the 
continual 
pressure 
of 
having 
to 
listen 
to 
other 
selves 
(and 
that 
is 
after 
all 
what 
reading 
means) 
awakened 
slowly, 
shyly, 
dubiously—but 
eventually 
it 
spoke 
again. 
Never 
have 
I 
felt 
happier 
with 
myself 
than 
in 
the 
sickest 
and 
most 
painful 
periods 
of 
my 
life: 
one 
only 
need 
look 
at 
The 
Dawn 
or 
perhaps 
The 
Wanderer 
and 
His 
Shadow 
to 
comprehend 
what 
this 
“return 
to 
myself” 
meant—a 
supreme 
kind 
of 
recovery. 
— 
The 
other 
kind 
merely 
followed 
from 
this. 

5 


Human, 
All-Too-Human, 
this 
monument 
of 
rigorous 
self-discipline 
with 
which 
I 
put 
a 
sudden 
end 
to 
all 
my 
infections 
with 
“higher 
swindle,” 
“idealism,” 
“beautiful 
feelings,” 
and 
other 
effeminacies, 
was 
written 
in 
the 
main 
in 
Sorrento; 
it 
was 
finished 
and 
received 
its 
final 
form 
during 
a 
winter 
in 
Basel, 
under 
conditions 
incomparably 
less 
favorable 
than 
those 
in 
Sorrento. 
Ultimately, 
Herr 
Peter 
Gast, 
who 
was 
then 
studying 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Basel 
and 
very 
devoted 
to 
me, 
has 
this 
book 
on 
his 
conscience. 
I 
dictated, 
my 
head 
bandaged 
and 
in 
pain; 
he 
wrote 
and 
also 
corrected: 
fundamentally, 
he 
was 
really 
the 
writer 
while 
I 
was 
merely 
the 
author. 


When 
the 
book 
was 
finally 
finished 
and 
in 
my 
hands—a 
profound 
surprise 
for 
one 
so 
seriously 
ill—I 
also 
sent 
two 
copies, 
among 
others, 
to 
Bayreuth. 
By 
a 
miraculously 
meaningful 
coincidence, 
I 
received 
at 
the 
very 
same 
time 
a 
beautiful 
copy 
of 
the 
text 
of 
Parsifal, 
with 
Wagner’s 
inscription 
for 
me, 
“for 
his 
dear 
friend, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsche, 
Richard 
Wagner, 
Church 
Councilor.”— 
This 
crossing 
of 
the 
two 
books—I 
felt 
as 
if 
I 
heard 
an 
ominous 
sound—as 
if 
two 
swords 
had 
crossed.— 
At 
any 
rate, 
both 
of 
us 
felt 
that 
way; 
for 
both 
of 
us 
remained 
silent.— 
Around 
that 
time 
the 
first 
Bayreuther 
Blätter 
appeared: 
I 
understood 
for 
what 
it 
was 
high 
time.— 
Incredible! 
Wagner 
had 
become 
pious. 



6 


How 
I 
thought 
about 
myself 
at 
this 
time 
(1876), 
with 
what 
tremendous 
sureness 
I 
got 
hold 
of 
my 
task 
and 
its 
world-historical 
aspect—the 
whole 
book 
bears 
witness 
to 
that, 
above 
all 
a 
very 
explicit 
passage. 
Only, 
with 
my 
instinctive 
cunning, 
I 
avoided 
the 
little 
word 
“I” 
once 
again 
and 
bathed 
in 
world-historical 
glory—not 
Schopenhauer 
or 
Wagner 
this 
time 
but 
one 
of 
my 
friends, 
the 
excellent 
Dr. 
Paul 
Rée—fortunately 
far 
too 
refined 
a 
creature 
to 
—1 


Others 
were 
less 
refined: 
I 
have 
always 
recognized 
who 
among 
my 
readers 
was 
hopeless—for 
example, 
the 
typical 
German 
professor—because 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
passage 
they 
thought 
they 
had 
to 
understand 
the 
whole 
book 
as 
higher 
Réealism.— 
In 
fact, 
the 
contents 
contradicted 
five 
or 
six 
propositions 
of 
my 
friend—a 
point 
discussed 
in 
the 
Preface 
to 
my 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals. 


The 
passage 
reads: 
“What 
is 
after 
all 
the 
main 
proposition 
that 
one 
of 
the 
boldest 
and 
coldest 
thinkers, 
the 
author 
of 
the 
book 
On 
the 
Origin 
of 
Moral 
Feelings 
[read: 
Nietzsche, 
the 
first 
immoralist] 
has 
reached 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
his 
incisive 
and 
penetrating 
analyses 
of 
human 
activity? 
The 
moral 
man 
is 
no 
closer 
to 
the 
intelligible 
world 
than 
the 
physical 
man—for 
there 
is 
no 
intelligible 
world 
…’ 
This 
proposition, 
grown 
hard 
and 
sharp 
under 
the 
hammer 
blow 
of 
historical 
insight 
[read: 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values], 
may 
perhaps 
one 
day, 
in 
some 
future—1890!—serve 
as 
the 
ax 
swung 
against 
the 
‘metaphysical 
need’ 
of 
mankind—but 
whether 
that 
will 
be 
more 
of 
a 
blessing 
or 
a 
curse 
for 
mankind, 
who 
could 
say? 
But 
in 
any 
case 
as 
a 
proposition 
of 
immense 
consequences, 
fruitful 
and 
terrible 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
looking 
into 
the 
world 
with 
that 
Janus 
face 
which 
all 
great 
insights 
share

Karl 
Franz 
Brendel 
(1811–1868) 
was 
editor 
of 
the 
Neue 
Zeitschrift 
für 
Musik 
(new 
journal 
for 
music), 
1845–1868, 
and 
of 
Anregungen

und 
Wissenschaft 
(stimulations 
for 
art, 
life 
and 
science), 
1856–61. 
He 
became 
a 
champion 
of 
Wagner 
in 
1851.

Karl 
Friedrich 
Ludwig 
Nohl 
(1831–1885) 
was 
a 
professor 
of 
music 
at 
the 
universities 
of 
Munich 
and 
Heidelberg, 
a 
prolific 
writer, 
especially 
on 
Mozart 
and 
Beethoven, 
and 
a 
dedicated 
Wagnerian. 
His 
publications 
include 
R. 
Wagners 
Bedeutung 
für 
die 
nationale 
Kunst 
(R. 
Wagner’s 
significance 
for 
national 
art; 
Vienna, 
1883) 
and 
Das 
moderne 
Musikdrama 
(the 
modern 
music 
drama; 
Vienna, 
1884). 
Richard 
Pohl 
(1826–1896) 
became 
co-editor 
(with 
Brendel) 
of 
Anregungen 
für 
Kunst, 
Leben 
und 
Wissenschaft, 
in 
1857. 
A 
Wagnerian 
since 
1846, 
he 
was 
sometimes 
called 
“the 
oldest 
Wagnerian.” 
Kohl, 
emphasized 
by 
Nietzsche, 
means 
drivel 
or 
twaddle 
as 
well 
as 
cabbage, 
and 
“drivel” 
is 
clearly 
the 
primary 
meaning 
intended 
here 
(“droll” 
represents 
an 
attempt 
to 
capture 
something 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
passage). 
This 
does 
not 
preclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
there 
may 
also 
have 
been 
some 
individual 
with 
this 
unfortunate 
name; 
e.g., 
a 
young 
man 
named 
Otto 
Kohl 
was 
a 
member 
of 
a 
small 
circle 
of 
philology 
students 
to 
which 
Nietzsche 
and 
Erwin 
Rohde 
had 
belonged 
in 
Leipzig. 
A 
superseded 
draft 
for 
this 
section 
contains 
two 
short 
passages 
worth 
quoting 
here: 
“Typical 
was 
the 
old 
Kaiser 
[i.e., 
Wilhelm 
I] 
who 
applauded 
with 
his 
hands 
while 
saying 
loudly 
to 
his 
adjutant, 
Count 
Lehndorf: 
‘Hideous! 
hideous!’ 
[scheusslich! 
scheusslich!]“ 
And: 
“In 
the 
music 
of 
Wagner, 
which 
persuaded 
by 
means 
of 
its 
secret 
sexuality, 
one 
found 
a 
bond 
for 
a 
society 
in 
which 
everybody 
pursued 
his 
own 
plaisirs 
[pleasures]. 
The 
rest 
and, 
if 
you 
will, 
also 
the 
innocence 
of 
the 
matter, 
its 
‘idealists’ 
were 
the 
idiots, 
the 
Nohl, 
Pohl, 
Kohl—the 
latter, 
known 
to 
me, 
the 
genius 
loci 
[minor 
local 
deity] 
in 
Bayreuth 
…”

Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
1961, 
p. 
276).

Podach’s 
vitriolic 
attack 
on 
Nietzsche’s 
account 
of 
his 
break 
with 
Wagner, 
and 
on 
Ecce 
Homo 
generally, 
is 
often 
out 
of 
touch 
with 
the 
facts—as 
when 
he 
says 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
sister, 
ignoring 
these 
words: 
“After 
all, 
it 
was 
scarcely 
feasible 
to 
blow 
down 
the 
story 
in 
Ecce 
Homo 



like 
a 
house 
of 
cards, 
by 
stating 
that 
her 
brother, 
in 
spite 
of 
financial 
difficulties, 
had 
soon 
returned 
to 
Bayreuth 
…” 
(p. 
196).

… 
nichts 
mehr 
getrieben 
als

: 
if 
the 
accent 
falls 
on 
nichts, 
the 
meaning 
is 
“pursued 
nothing 
any 
more 
except,” 
which 
is 
palpably 
false 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
biographical 
fact. 
If 
the 
accent 
falls 
on 
mehr, 
the 
meaning 
is 
that 
suggested 
above, 
which 
may 
still 
be 
considered 
a 
rhetorical 
exaggeration.

This 
splendid 
sentence 
illuminates 
Nietzsche’s 
ideas 
about 
“selflove” 
and 
“selflessness.”

Nietzsche 
collapsed 
a 
few 
weeks 
after 
writing 
this. 
This 
paragraph 
illustrates 
beautifully 
what 
Nietzsche 
says 
about 
amor 
fati, 
freedom 
from 
ressentiment, 
and 
saying 
Yes 
even 
to 
suffering.

In 
the 
various 
German 
editions 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
this 
quotation 
is 
not 
printed 
in 
quotation 
marks, 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
insertions 
are 
placed 
in 
parentheses 
rather 
than 
brackets; 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
reference 
to 
the 
source 
of 
the 
quotation: 
Human, 
All-Too-Human, 
section 
37. 
As 
a 
result, 
it 
is 
left 
unclear 
what 
exactly 
is 
quoted 
and 
what 
is 
not. 
Of 
course, 
“—1890! 
—” 
is 
also 
an 
insertion 
not 
found 
in 
the 
text 
of 
1878. 
Nietzsche’s 
other 
deviations 
from 
the 
original 
text 
are 
so 
slight 
that 
they 
are 
not 
worth 
listing 
here, 
except 
that 
the 
quotation 
from 
Rée’s 
book 
originally 
read 
as 
follows: 
“The 
moral 
man,” 
says 
he, 
“is 
no 
closer 
to 
the 
intelligible 
(metaphysical) 
world 
than 
the 
physical 
man.” 
The 
next 
six 
words 
were 
not 
quoted 
in 
Human, 
All-Too-Human. 



Dawn 


Thoughts 
About 
Morality 
as 
a 
Prejudice 



1 


With 
this 
book 
my 
campaign 
against 
morality 
begins. 
Not 
that 
it 
smells 
in 
the 
least 
of 
powder: 
you 
will 
smell 
far 
different 
and 
much 
lovelier 
scents 
in 
it, 
assuming 
your 
nostrils 
have 
some 
sensitivity. 
Neither 
big 
nor 
small 
guns: 
if 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
book 
is 
negative, 
its 
means 
are 
anything 
but 
that—these 
means 
from 
which 
the 
effect 
issues 
like 
an 
inference, 
not 
like 
a 
cannon 
shot. 
If 
one 
takes 
leave 
of 
the 
book 
with 
a 
cautious 
reserve 
about 
everything 
that 
has 
so 
far 
attained 
honor 
and 
even 
worship 
under 
the 
name 
of 
morality, 
this 
in 
no 
way 
contradicts 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
whole 
book 
contains 
no 
negative 
word, 
no 
attack, 
no 
spite—that 
it 
lies 
in 
the 
sun, 
round, 
happy, 
like 
some 
sea 
animal 
basking 
among 
rocks. 


Ultimately, 
I 
myself 
was 
this 
sea 
animal: 
almost 
every 
sentence 
in 
this 
book 
was 
first 
thought, 
caught 
among 
that 
jumble 
of 
rocks 
near 
Genoa 
where 
I 
was 
alone 
and 
still 
had 
secrets 
with 
the 
sea. 
Even 
now, 
whenever 
I 
accidentally 
touch 
this 
book, 
almost 
every 
sentence 
turns 
for 
me 
into 
a 
net 
that 
again 
brings 
up 
from 
the 
depths 
something 
incomparable: 
its 
entire 
skin 
trembles 
with 
tender 
thrills 
of 
memory. 
The 
art 
that 
distinguishes 
it 
is 
not 
inconsiderable 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
fixing 
to 
some 
extent 
things 
that 
easily 
flit 
by, 
noiselessly—moments 
I 
call 
divine 
lizards—but 
not 
with 
the 
cruelty 
of 
that 
young 
Greek 
god 
who 
simply 
speared 
the 
poor 
little 
lizard, 
though, 
to 
be 
sure, 
with 
something 
pointed—a 
pen. 


“There 
are 
so 
many 
dawns 
that 
have 
not 
yet 
glowed”—this 
Indian 
inscription 
marks 
the 
opening 
of 
this 
book. 
Where 
does 
its 
author 
seek 
that 
new 
morning, 
that 
as 
yet 
undiscovered 
tender 
red 
that 
marks 
the 
beginning 
of 
another 
day—ah, 
a 
whole 
series, 
a 
whole 
world 
of 
new 
days? 
In 
a 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values, 
in 
a 
liberation 
from 
all 
moral 
values, 
in 
saying 
Yes 
to 
and 
having 
confidence 
in 
all 
that 
has 
hitherto 
been 
forbidden, 
despised, 
and 
damned. 
This 
Yes-saying 
book 
pours 
out 
its 
light, 
its 
love, 
its 
tenderness 
upon 
ever 
so 
many 
wicked 
things; 
it 
gives 
back 
to 
them 
their 
“soul,” 
a 
good 
conscience, 
the 
lofty 
right 
and 
privilege 
of 
existence. 
Morality 
is 
not 
attacked, 
it 
is 
merely 
no 
longer 
in 
the 
picture. 


This 
book 
closes 
with 
an 
“Or?”—it 
is 
the 
only 
book 
that 
closes 
with 
an 



“Or?”

My 
task 
of 
preparing 
a 
moment 
of 
the 
highest 
self-examination 
for 
humanity, 
a 
great 
noon 
when 
it 
looks 
back 
and 
far 
forward, 
when 
it 
emerges 
from 
the 
dominion 
of 
accidents 
and 
priests 
and 
for 
the 
first 
time 
poses, 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
question 
of 
Why? 
and 
For 
What?—this 
task 
follows 
of 
necessity 
from 
the 
insight 
that 
humanity 
is 
not 
all 
by 
itself 
on 
the 
right 
way, 
that 
it 
is 
by 
no 
means 
governed 
divinely, 
that, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
has 
been 
precisely 
among 
its 
holiest 
value 
concepts 
that 
the 
instinct 
of 
denial, 
corruption, 
and 
decadence 
has 
ruled 
seductively. 
The 
question 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
moral 
values 
is 
for 
me 
a 
question 
of 
the 
very 
first 
rank 
because 
it 
is 
crucial 
for 
the 
future 
of 
humanity. 
The 
demand 
that 
we 
should 
believe 
that 
everything 
is 
really 
in 
the 
best 
of 
hands, 
that 
a 
book, 
the 
Bible, 
offers 
us 
definitive 
assurances 
about 
the 
divine 
governance 
and 
wisdom 
in 
the 
destiny 
of 
man, 
is 
—translated 
back 
into 
reality—the 
will 
to 
suppress 
the 
truth 
about 
the 
pitiable 
opposite 
of 
all 
this; 
namely, 
that 
humanity 
has 
so 
far 
been 
in 
the 
worst 
of 
hands 
and 
that 
it 
has 
been 
governed 
by 
the 
underprivileged, 
the 
craftily 
vengeful, 
the 
so-called 
“saints,” 
these 
slanderers 
of 
the 
world 
and 
violators 
of 
man. 


The 
decisive 
symptom 
that 
shows 
how 
the 
priest 
(including 
those 
cryptopriests, 
the 
philosophers) 
has 
become 
master 
quite 
generally 
and 
not 
only 
within 
a 
certain 
religious 
community, 
and 
that 
the 
morality 
of 
decadence, 
the 
will 
to 
the 
end 
has 
become 
accepted 
as 
morality 
itself, 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
is 
unegoistic 
is 
everywhere 
assigned 
absolute 
value 
while 
what 
is 
egoistic 
is 
met 
with 
hostility. 
Whoever 
is 
at 
odds 
with 
me 
about 
that 
is 
to 
my 
mind 
infected.— 
But 
all 
the 
world 
is 
at 
odds 
with 
me. 


For 
a 
physiologist 
such 
a 
juxtaposition 
of 
values 
simply 
leaves 
no 
doubt. 
When 
the 
least 
organ 
in 
an 
organism 
fails, 
however 
slightly, 
to 
enforce 
with 
complete 
assurance 
its 
self-preservation, 
its 
“egoism,” 
restitution 
of 
its 
energies—the 
whole 
degenerates. 
The 
physiologist 
demands 
excision 
of 
the 
degenerating 
part; 
he 
denies 
all 
solidarity 
with 
what 
degenerates; 
he 
is 
worlds 
removed 
from 
pity 
for 
it. 
But 
the 
priest 
desires 
precisely 
the 
degeneration 
of 
the 
whole, 
of 
humanity: 
for 
that 
reason, 
he 
conserves 
what 
degenerates—at 
this 
price 
he 
rules. 



When 
seriousness 
is 
deflected 
from 
the 
self-preservation 
and 
the 
enhancement 
of 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
body—that 
is, 
of 
life—when 
anemia 
is 
construed 
as 
an 
ideal, 
and 
contempt 
for 
the 
body 
as 
“salvation 
of 
the 
soul”— 
what 
else 
is 
this 
if 
not 
a 
recipe 
for 
decadence? 


The 
loss 
of 
the 
center 
of 
gravity, 
resistance 
to 
the 
natural 
instincts—in 
one 
word, 
“selflessness”—that 
is 
what 
was 
hitherto 
called 
morality.— 
With 
the 
Dawn 
I 
first 
took 
up 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
morality 
that 
would 
unself 
man.1 


1 
Die 
Entselbstungs-Moral: 
Entselbstung 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
coinage; 
“unself” 
is 
inspired 
by 
Lady 
Macbeth’s 
“unsex 
me.” 



The 
Gay 
Science 
(“la 
gaya 
scienza”) 


The 
Dawn 
is 
a 
Yes-saying 
book, 
deep 
but 
bright 
and 
gracious. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
also 
and 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
the 
gaya 
scienza: 
in 
almost 
every 
sentence 
profundity 
and 
high 
spirits 
go 
tenderly 
hand 
in 
hand. 
Some 
verses 
that 
express 
my 
gratitude 
for 
the 
most 
wonderful 
month 
of 
January 
I 
ever 
experienced—this 
whole 
book 
was 
its 
present—reveals 
sufficiently 
from 
what 
depths 
this 
“science” 
emerged 
to 
gaiety: 


With 
a 
flaming 
spear 
you 
parted 


All 
its 
ice 
until 
my 
soul 


Hurries 
roaring 
toward 
the 
ocean 


Of 
its 
highest 
hope 
and 
goal: 


Ever 
healthier 
and 
brighter, 
In 
most 
loving 
constraint, 
free— 
Thus 
it 
praises 
your 
great 
wonders, 
Fairest 
month 
of 
January!1 


What 
is 
here 
called 
“highest 
hope”—who 
could 
have 
any 
doubt 
about 
that 
when 
he 
sees 
the 
diamond 
beauty 
of 
the 
first 
words 
of 
Zarathustra 
flashing 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fourth 
book?— 
Or 
when 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
third 
book 
he 
reads 
the 
granite 
words 
in 
which 
a 
destiny 
finds 
for 
the 
first 
time 
a 
formula 
for 
itself, 
for 
all 
time?2 


The 
“Songs 
of 
Prince 
Free-as-a-Bird,”3 
written 
for 
the 
most 
part 
in 
Sicily, 
are 
quite 
emphatically 
reminiscent 
of 
the 
Provençal 
concept 
of 
gaya 
scienza 
—that 
unity 
of 
singer, 
knight, 
and 
free 
spirit 
which 
distinguishes 
the 
wonderful 
early 
culture 
of 
the 
Provençals 
from 
all 
equivocal 
cultures. 
The 
very 
last 
poem 
above 
all, 
“To 
the 
Mistral,”4 
an 
exuberant 
dancing 
song 
in 
which, 
if 
I 
may 
say 
so, 
one 
dances 
right 
over 
morality, 
is 
a 
perfect 
Provençalism.

Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra 


A 
Book 
for 
All 
and 
None 



1 


Now 
I 
shall 
relate 
the 
history 
of 
Zarathustra. 
The 
fundamental 
conception 
of 
this 
work, 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
eternal 
recurrence, 
this 
highest 
formula 
of 
affirmation 
that 
is 
at 
all 
attainable, 
belongs 
in 
August 
1881: 
it 
was 
penned 
on 
a 
sheet 
with 
the 
notation 
underneath, 
“6000 
feet 
beyond 
man 
and 
time.” 
That 
day 
I 
was 
walking 
through 
the 
woods 
along 
the 
lake 
of 
Silvaplana; 
at 
a 
powerful 
pyramidal 
rock 
not 
far 
from 
Surlei 
I 
stopped.1 
It 
was 
then 
that 
this 
idea 
came 
to 
me. 


If 
I 
reckon 
back 
a 
few 
months 
from 
this 
day, 
I 
find 
as 
an 
omen 
a 
sudden 
and 
profoundly 
decisive 
change 
in 
my 
taste, 
especially 
in 
music. 
Perhaps 
the 
whole 
of 
Zarathustra 
may 
be 
reckoned 
as 
music; 
certainly 
a 
rebirth 
of 
the 
art 
of 
hearing 
was 
among 
its 
preconditions. 
In 
a 
small 
mountain 
spa 
not 
far 
from 
Vicenza, 
Recoaro, 
where 
I 
spent 
the 
spring 
of 
1881, 
I 
discovered 
together 
with 
my 
maestro 
and 
friend, 
Peter 
Gast, 
who 
was 
also 
“reborn,” 
that 
the 
phoenix 
of 
music 
flew 
past 
us 
with 
lighter 
and 
more 
brilliant 
feathers 
than 
it 
had 
ever 
displayed 
before. 
But 
if 
I 
reckon 
forward 
from 
that 
day 
to 
the 
sudden 
birth 
that 
occurred 
in 
February 
1883 
under 
the 
most 
improbable 
circumstances—the 
finale 
from 
which 
I 
have 
quoted 
a 
few 
sentences 
in 
the 
Preface 
was 
finished 
exactly 
in 
that 
sacred 
hour 
in 
which 
Richard 
Wagner 
died 
in 
Venice—we 
get 
eighteen 
months 
for 
the 
pregnancy. 
This 
figure 
of 
precisely 
eighteen 
months 
might 
suggest, 
at 
least 
to 
Buddhists, 
that 
I 
am 
really 
a 
female 
elephant. 


My 
gaya 
scienza 
belongs 
in 
the 
interval 
and 
contains 
a 
hundred 
signs 
of 
the 
proximity 
of 
something 
incomparable; 
in 
the 
end 
it 
even 
offers 
the 
beginning 
of 
Zarathustra, 
and 
in 
the 
penultimate 
section 
of 
the 
fourth 
book 


2

the 
basic 
idea 
of 
Zarathustra. 


Something 
else 
also 
belongs 
in 
this 
interval: 
that 
Hymn 
to 
Life 
(for 
mixed 
choir 
and 
orchestra) 
whose 
score 
was 
published 
two 
years 
ago 
by 
E. 
W. 
Fritzsch 
in 
Leipzig—a 
scarcely 
trivial 
symptom 
of 
my 
condition 
during 
that 
year 
when 
the 
Yes-saying 
pathos 
par 
excellence, 
which 
I 
call 
the 
tragic 
pathos, 
was 
alive 
in 
me 
to 
the 
highest 
degree. 
The 
time 
will 
come 
when 
it 
will 
be 
sung 
in 
my 
memory.3 



The 
text, 
to 
say 
this 
expressly 
because 
a 
misunderstanding 
has 
gained 
currency, 
is 
not 
by 
me: 
it 
is 
the 
amazing 
inspiration 
of 
a 
young 
Russian 
woman 
who 
was 
my 
friend 
at 
that 
time, 
Miss 
Lou 
von 
Salomé.4 
Whoever 
can 
find 
any 
meaning 
at 
all 
in 
the 
last 
words 
of 
this 
poem 
will 
guess 
why 
I 
preferred 
and 
admired 
it: 
they 
attain 
greatness. 
Pain 
is 
not 
considered 
an 
objection 
to 
life: 
“If 
you 
have 
no 
more 
happiness 
to 
give 
me, 
well 
then! 
you 
still 
have 
suffering.” 
Perhaps 
my 
music, 
too, 
attains 
greatness 
at 
this 
point. 
(Last 
note 
of 
the 
A-clarinet, 
c 
flat, 
not 
c: 
misprint.) 


The 
following 
winter 
I 
stayed 
in 
that 
charming 
quiet 
bay 
of 
Rapallo 
which, 
not 
far 
from 
Genoa, 
is 
cut 
out 
between 
Chiavari 
and 
the 
foothills 
of 
Portofino. 
My 
health 
could 
have 
been 
better; 
the 
winter 
was 
cold 
and 
excessively 
rainy; 
my 
small 
albergo,5 
situated 
right 
at 
the 
sea 
so 
that 
the 
high 
sea 
made 
it 
impossible 
to 
sleep 
at 
night, 
was 
in 
just 
about 
every 
way 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
one 
might 
wish 
for. 
In 
spite 
of 
this 
and 
almost 
in 
order 
to 
prove 
my 
proposition 
that 
everything 
decisive 
comes 
into 
being 
“in 
spite 
of,” 
it 
was 
that 
winter 
and 
under 
these 
unfavorable 
circumstances 
that 
my 
Zarathustra 
came 
into 
being. 


Mornings 
I 
would 
walk 
in 
a 
southerly 
direction 
on 
the 
splendid 
road 
to 
Zoagli, 
going 
up 
past 
pines 
with 
a 
magnificent 
view 
of 
the 
sea; 
in 
the 
afternoon, 
whenever 
my 
health 
permitted 
it, 
I 
walked 
around 
the 
whole 
bay 
from 
Santa 
Margherita 
all 
the 
way 
to 
Portofino. 
This 
place 
and 
this 
scenery 
came 
even 
closer 
to 
my 
heart 
because 
of 
the 
great 
love 
that 
Emperor 
Frederick 
III 
felt 
for 
them; 
by 
chance, 
I 
was 
in 
this 
coastal 
region 
again 
in 
the 
fall 
of 
1886 
when 
he 
visited 
this 
small 
forgotten 
world 
of 
bliss 
for 
the 
last 
time.6 


— 
It 
was 
on 
these 
two 
walks 
that 
the 
whole 
of 
Zarathustra 
I 
occurred 
to 
me,7 
and 
especially 
Zarathustra 
himself 
as 
a 
type: 
rather, 
he 
overtook 
me.8 

2 


To 
understand 
this 
type, 
one 
must 
first 
become 
clear 
about 
his 
physiological 
presupposition: 
this 
is 
what 
I 
call 
the 
great 
health. 
I 
don’t 
know 
how 
I 
could 
explain 
this 
concept 
better, 
more 
personally, 
than 
I 
have 
done 
it 
in 
one 
of 
the 
last 
sections 
of 
the 
fifth 
book 
of 
my 
gaya 
scienza.1 


Being 
new, 
nameless, 
self-evident, 
we 
premature 
births 
of 
an 
as 
yet 
unproven 
future, 
we 
need 
for 
a 
new 
goal 
also 
a 
new 
means—namely, 
a 
new 
health, 
stronger, 
more 
seasoned, 
tougher, 
more 
audacious, 
and 
gayer 
than 
any 
previous 
health. 
Whoever 
has 
a 
soul 
that 
craves 
to 
have 
experienced 
the 
whole 
range 
of 
values 
and 
desiderata 
to 
date, 
and 
to 
have 
sailed 
around 
all 
the 
coasts 
of 
this 
ideal 
“mediterranean”; 
whoever 
wants 
to 
know 
from 
the 
adventures 
of 
his 
own 
most 
authentic 
experience 
how 
a 
discoverer 
and 
conqueror 
of 
the 
ideal 
feels, 
and 
also 
an 
artist, 
a 
saint, 
a 
legislator, 
a 
sage, 
a 
scholar, 
a 
pious 
man,2 
and 
one 
who 
stands 
divinely 
apart 
in 
the 
old 
style—needs 
one 
thing 
above 
everything 
else: 
the 
great 
health—that 
one 
does 
not 
merely 
have 
but 
also 
acquires 
continually, 
and 
must 
acquire 
because 
one 
gives 
it 
up 
again 
and 
again, 
and 
must 
give 
it 
up. 


And 
now, 
after 
we 
have 
long 
been 
on 
our 
way 
in 
this 
manner, 
we 
argonauts 
of 
the 
ideal, 
with 
more 
daring 
perhaps 
than 
is 
prudent, 
and 
have 
suffered 
shipwreck 
and 
damage 
often 
enough, 
but 
are, 
to 
repeat 
it, 
healthier 
than 
one 
likes 
to 
permit 
us, 
dangerously 
healthy, 
ever 
again 
healthy—it 
will 
seem 
to 
us 
as 
if, 
as 
a 
reward, 
we 
now 
confronted 
an 
as 
yet 
undiscovered 
country 
whose 
boundaries 
nobody 
has 
surveyed 
yet, 
something 
beyond 
all 
the 
lands 
and 
nooks 
of 
the 
ideal 
so 
far, 
a 
world 
so 
overrich 
in 
what 
is 
beautiful, 
strange, 
questionable, 
terrible, 
and 
divine 
that 
our 
curiosity 
as 
well 
as 
our 
craving 
to 
possess 
it 
has 
got 
beside 
itself 
—alas, 
now 
nothing 
will 
sate 
us 
any 
more! 


After 
such 
vistas 
and 
with 
such 
a 
burning 
hunger 
in 
our 
conscience 
and 
science,3 
how 
could 
we 
still 
be 
satisfied 
with 
present-day 
man? 
It 
may 
be 
too 
bad 
but 
it 
is 
inevitable 
that 
we 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
remain 



serious 
when 
we 
look 
at 
his 
worthiest 
goals 
and 
hopes, 
and 
perhaps 
we 
do 
not 
even 
bother 
to 
look 
any 
more. 


Another 
ideal 
runs 
ahead 
of 
us, 
a 
strange, 
tempting, 
dangerous 
ideal 
to 
which 
we 
should 
not 
wish 
to 
persuade 
anybody 
because 
we 
do 
not 
readily 
concede 
the 
right 
to 
it 
to 
anyone: 
the 
ideal 
of 
a 
spirit 
who 
plays 
naively—that 
is, 
not 
deliberately 
but 
from 
overflowing 
power 
and 
abundance—with 
all 
that 
was 
hitherto 
called 
holy, 
good, 
untouchable, 
divine; 
for 
whom 
those 
supreme 
things 
that 
the 
people 
naturally 
accept 
as 
their 
value 
standards, 
signify 
danger, 
decay, 
debasement, 
or 
at 
least 
recreation, 
blindness, 
and 
temporary 
self-oblivion; 
the 
ideal 
of 
a 
human, 
superhuman 
well-being 
and 
benevolence4 
that 
will 
often 
appear 
inhuman—for 
example, 
when 
it 
confronts 
all 
earthly 
seriousness 
so 
far, 
all 
solemnity 
in 
gesture, 
word, 
tone, 
eye, 
morality, 
and 
task 
so 
far, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
their 
most 
incarnate 
and 
involuntary 
parody—and 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
of 
this, 
it 
is 
perhaps 
only 
with 
him 
that 
great 
seriousness 
really 
begins, 
that 
the 
real 
question 
mark 
is 
posed 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
that 
the 
destiny 
of 
the 
soul 
changes, 
the 
hand 
moves 
forward, 
the 
tragedy 
begins.5

Has 
anyone 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
what 
poets 
of 
strong 
ages 
have 
called 
inspiration? 
If 
not, 
I 
will 
describe 
it.— 
If 
one 
had 
the 
slightest 
residue 
of 
superstition 
left 
in 
one’s 
system, 
one 
could 
hardly 
reject 
altogether 
the 
idea 
that 
one 
is 
merely 
incarnation, 
merely 
mouthpiece, 
merely 
a 
medium 
of 
overpowering 
forces. 
The 
concept 
of 
revelation—in 
the 
sense 
that 
suddenly, 
with 
indescribable 
certainty 
and 
subtlety, 
something 
becomes 
visible, 
audible, 
something 
that 
shakes 
one 
to 
the 
last 
depths 
and 
throws 
one 
down—that 
merely 
describes 
the 
facts. 
One 
hears, 
one 
does 
not 
seek; 
one 
accepts, 
one 
does 
not 
ask 
who 
gives; 
like 
lightning, 
a 
thought 
flashes 
up, 
with 
necessity, 
without 
hesitation 
regarding 
its 
form—I 
never 
had 
any 
choice. 


A 
rapture 
whose 
tremendous 
tension 
occasionally 
discharges 
itself 
in 
a 
flood 
of 
tears—now 
the 
pace 
quickens 
involuntarily, 
now 
it 
becomes 
slow; 
one 
is 
altogether 
beside 
oneself, 
with 
the 
distinct 
consciousness 
of 
subtle 
shudders 
and 
of 
one’s 
skin 
creeping1 
down 
to 
one’s 
toes; 
a 
depth 
of 
happiness 
in 
which 
even 
what 
is 
most 
painful 
and 
gloomy 
does 
not 
seem 
something 
opposite 
but 
rather 
conditioned, 
provoked, 
a 
necessary 
color 
in 
such 
a 
superabundance 
of 
light; 
an 
instinct 
for 
rhythmic 
relationships 
that 
arches 
over 
wide 
spaces 
of 
forms—length, 
the 
need 
for 
a 
rhythm 
with 
wide 
arches,2 
is 
almost 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
force 
of 
inspiration, 
a 
kind 
of 
compensation 
for 
its 
pressure 
and 
tension. 


Everything 
happens 
involuntarily 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
but 
as 
in 
a 
gale 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
freedom, 
of 
absoluteness, 
of 
power, 
of 
divinity.— 
The 
involuntariness 
of 
image 
and 
metaphor 
is 
strangest 
of 
all; 
one 
no 
longer 
has 
any 
notion 
of 
what 
is 
an 
image 
or 
a 
metaphor: 
everything 
offers 
itself 
as 
the 
nearest, 
most 
obvious, 
simplest 
expression. 
It 
actually 
seems, 
to 
allude 
to 
something 
Zarathustra 
says, 
as 
if 
the 
things 
themselves 
approached 
and 
offered 
themselves 
as 
metaphors 
(“Here 
all 
things 
come 
caressingly 
to 
your 
discourse 
and 
flatter 
you; 
for 
they 
want 
to 
ride 
on 
your 
back. 
On 
every 
metaphor 
you 
ride 
to 
every 
truth.… 
Here 
the 
words 
and 
word-shrines 
of 
all 
being 
open 
up 
before 
you; 
here 
all 
being 
wishes 
to 
become 
word, 
all 



becoming 
wishes 
to 
learn 
from 
you 
how 
to 
speak”).3 


This 
is 
my 
experience 
of 
inspiration; 
I 
do 
not 
doubt 
that 
one 
has 
to 
go 
back 
thousands 
of 
years 
in 
order 
to 
find 
anyone 
who 
could 
say 
to 
me, 
“it 
is 
mine 
as 
well.”4 



4 


Afterwards 
I 
was 
sick 
for 
a 
few 
weeks 
in 
Genoa. 
Then 
came 
a 
melancholy 
spring 
in 
Rome 
where 
I 
put 
up 
with 
life—it 
was 
not 
easy. 
Fundamentally, 
this 
most 
indecent 
place 
on 
earth 
for 
the 
poet 
of 
Zarathustra 
distressed 
me 
exceedingly, 
and 
I 
had 
not 
chosen 
it 
voluntarily. 
I 
wanted 
to 
go 
to 
Aquila,1 
Rome’s 
counterconcept, 
founded 
from 
hostility 
against 
Rome, 
as 
I 
shall 
one 
day 
found 
a 
place, 
in2 
memory 
of 
an 
atheist 
and 
enemy 
of 
the 
church 
comme 
il 
faut,3 
one 
of 
those 
most 
closely 
related 
to 
me, 
the 
great 
Hohenstaufen 
Emperor 
Frederick 
II.4 
But 
some 
fatality 
was 
at 
work: 
I 
had 
to 
go 
back 
again.5 
In 
the 
end 
I 
resigned 
myself 
to 
the 
Piazza 
Barberini, 
after 
my 
exertions 
to 
go 
to 
an 
anti-Christian 
environment 
had 
wearied 
me. 
I 
fear 
that 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
bad 
odors 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
I 
once 
inquired 
at 
the 
Palazzo 
del 
Quirinale 
itself6 
whether 
they 
did 
not 
have 
a 
quiet 
room 
for 
a 
philosopher. 


It 
was 
on 
a 
loggia 
high 
above 
that 
Piazza, 
from 
which 
one 
has 
a 
fine 
view 
of 
Rome 
and 
hears 
the 
fontana 
splashing 
far 
below, 
that 
the 
loneliest 
song 
was 
written 
that 
has 
ever 
been 
written, 
the 
“Night 
Song.”7 
Around 
that 
time 
a 
melody 
of 
indescribable 
melancholy 
was 
always 
about 
me, 
and 
I 
found 
its 
refrain 
in 
the 
words, 
“dead 
from 
immortality.” 


That 
summer, 
back 
home 
at 
the 
holy 
spot 
where 
the 
first 
lightning 
of 
the 
Zarathustra 
idea 
had 
flashed 
for 
me, 
I 
found 
Zarathustra 
II. 
Ten 
days 
sufficed; 
in 
no 
case, 
neither 
for 
the 
first 
nor 
for 
the 
third 
and 
last,8 
did 
I 
require 
more. 
The 
next 
winter, 
under 
the 
halcyon 
sky 
of 
Nizza, 
which 
then 
shone 
into 
my 
life 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
I 
found 
Zarathustra 
III—and 
was 
finished. 
Scarcely 
a 
year 
for 
the 
whole 
of 
it. 


Many 
concealed 
spots 
and 
heights 
in 
the 
landscape 
around 
Nizza 
are 
hallowed 
for 
me 
by 
unforgettable 
moments; 
that 
decisive 
passage 
which 
bears 
the 
title 
“On 
Old 
and 
New 
Tablets”9 
was 
composed 
on 
the 
most 
onerous 
ascent 
from 
the 
station 
to 
the 
marvelous 
Moorish 
eyrie, 
Eza—the 
suppleness 
of 
my 
muscles 
has 
always 
been 
greatest 
when 
my 
creative 
energies 
were 
flowing 
most 
abundantly. 
The 
body 
is 
inspired; 
let 
us 
keep 
the 
“soul” 
out 
of 
it.—Often 
one 
could 
have 
seen 
me 
dance; 
in 
those 
days 
I 
could 
walk 
in 
the 
mountains 
for 
seven 
or 
eight 
hours 
without 
a 
trace 
of 
weariness. 
I 



slept 
well, 
I 
laughed 
much—my 
vigor 
and 
patience 
were 
perfect. 



5 


Except 
for 
these 
ten-day 
works, 
the 
years 
during 
and 
above 
all 
after 
my 
Zarathustra 
were 
marked 
by 
distress 
without 
equal. 
One 
pays 
dearly 
for 
immortality: 
one 
has 
to 
die 
several 
times 
while 
still 
alive. 


There 
is 
something 
I 
call 
the 
rancune1 
of 
what 
is 
great: 
everything 
great— 
a 
work, 
a 
deed—is 
no 
sooner 
accomplished 
than 
it 
turns 
against 
the 
man 
who 
did 
it. 
By 
doing 
it, 
he 
has 
become 
weak; 
he 
no 
longer 
endures 
his 
deed, 
he 
can 
no 
longer 
face 
it. 
Something 
one 
was 
never 
permitted 
to 
will 
lies 
behind 
one, 
something 
in 
which 
the 
knot 
in 
the 
destiny 
of 
humanity 
is 
tied—and 
now 
one 
labors 
under 
it!— 
It 
almost 
crushes 
one.— 
The 
rancune 
of 
what 
is 
great. 


Then 
there 
is 
the 
gruesome 
silence 
one 
hears 
all 
around 
one. 
Solitude 
has 
seven 
skins; 
nothing 
penetrates 
them 
any 
more. 
One 
comes 
to 
men, 
one 
greets 
friends—more 
desolation, 
no 
eye 
offers 
a 
greeting. 
At 
best, 
a 
kind 
of 
revolt. 
Such 
revolts 
I 
experienced, 
very 
different 
in 
degree 
but 
from 
almost 
everybody 
who 
was 
close 
to 
me. 
It 
seems 
nothing 
offends 
more 
deeply 
than 
suddenly 
letting 
others 
feel 
a 
distance;2 
those 
noble 
natures 
who 
do 
not 
know 
how 
to 
live 
without 
reverence 
are 
rare. 


Thirdly, 
there 
is 
the 
absurd 
sensitivity 
of 
the 
skin 
to 
small 
stings, 
a 
kind 
of 
helplessness 
against 
everything 
small.3 
This 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
due 
to 
the 
tremendous 
squandering 
of 
all 
defensive 
energies 
which 
is 
a 
presupposition 
of 
every 
creative 
deed, 
every 
deed 
that 
issues 
from 
one’s 
most 
authentic, 
inmost, 
nethermost 
regions. 
Our 
small 
defensive 
capacities 
are 
thus, 
as 
it 
were, 
suspended; 
no 
energy 
is 
left 
for 
them. 


I 
still 
dare 
to 
hint 
that 
one 
digests 
less 
well, 
does 
not 
like 
to 
move, 
is 
all 
too 
susceptible 
to 
feeling 
chills 
as 
well 
as 
mistrust—mistrust 
that 
is 
in 
many 
instances 
merely 
an 
etiological 
blunder. 
In 
such 
a 
state 
I 
once 
sensed 
the 
proximity 
of 
a 
herd 
of 
cows 
even 
before 
I 
saw 
it, 
merely 
because 
milder 
and 
more 
philanthropic 
thoughts 
came 
back 
to 
me: 
they 
had 
warmth. 



6 


This 
work 
stands 
altogether 
apart. 
Leaving 
aside 
the 
poets: 
perhaps 
nothing 
has 
ever 
been 
done 
from 
an 
equal 
excess 
of 
strength. 
My 
concept 
of 
the 
“Dionysian” 
here 
became 
a 
supreme 
deed; 
measured 
against 
that, 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
human 
activity 
seems 
poor 
and 
relative. 
That 
a 
Goethe, 
a 
Shakespeare, 
would 
be 
unable 
to 
breathe 
even 
for 
a 
moment 
in 
this 
tremendous 
passion 
and 
height, 
that 
Dante 
is, 
compared 
with 
Zarathustra, 
merely 
a 
believer 
and 
not 
one 
who 
first 
creates 
truth, 
a 
world-governing 
spirit, 
a 
destiny—that 
the 
poets 
of 
the 
Veda 
are 
priests 
and 
not 
even 
worthy 
of 
tying 
the 
shoelaces 
of 
a 
Zarathustra—that 
is 
the 
least 
thing 
and 
gives 
no 
idea 
of 
the 
distance, 
of 
the 
azure 
solitude 
in 
which 
this 
work 
lives. 
Zarathustra 
possesses 
an 
eternal 
right 
to 
say: 
“I 
draw 
circles 
around 
me 
and 
sacred 
boundaries; 
fewer 
and 
fewer 
men 
climb 
with 
me 
on 
ever 
higher 
mountains: 
I 
am 
building 
a 
mountain 
range 
out 
of 
ever 
more 
sacred 
mountains.”1 


Let 
anyone 
add 
up 
the 
spirit 
and 
good 
nature 
of 
all 
great 
souls:2 
all 
of 
them 
together 
would 
not 
be 
capable 
of 
producing 
even 
one 
of 
Zarathustra’s 
discourses. 
The 
ladder 
on 
which 
he 
ascends 
and 
descends3 
is 
tremendous; 
he 
has 
seen 
further, 
willed 
further, 
been 
capable 
further 
than 
any 
other 
human 
being. 
In 
every 
word 
he 
contradicts, 
this 
most 
Yes-saying 
of 
all 
spirits; 
in 
him 
all 
opposites 
are 
blended 
into 
a 
new 
unity. 
The 
highest 
and 
the 
lowest 
energies 
of 
human 
nature, 
what 
is 
sweetest, 
most 
frivolous, 
and 
most 
terrible 
wells 
forth 
from 
one 
fount 
with 
immortal 
assurance. 
Till 
then 
one 
does 
not 
know 
what 
is 
height, 
what 
depth; 
one 
knows 
even 
less 
what 
truth 
is. 
There 
is 
no 
moment 
in 
this 
revelation 
of 
truth 
that 
has 
been 
anticipated 
or 
guessed 
by 
even 
one 
of 
the 
greatest. 
There 
is 
no 
wisdom, 
no 
investigation 
of 
the 
soul, 
no 
art 
of 
speech 
before 
Zarathustra; 
what 
is 
nearest 
and 
most 
everyday, 
here 
speaks 
of 
unheard-of 
things. 
Epigrams 
trembling 
with 
passion, 
eloquence 
become 
music, 
lightning 
bolts 
hurled 
forward 
into 
hitherto 
unfathomed 
futures. 
The 
most 
powerful 
capacity 
for 
metaphors 
that 
has 
existed 
so 
far 
is 
poor 
and 
mere 
child’s 
play 
compared 
with 
this 
return 
of 
language 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
imagery. 


And 
how 
Zarathustra 
descends 
and 
says 
to 
everyone 
what 
is 
most 
good



natured! 
How 
gently 
he 
handles 
even 
his 
antagonists, 
the 
priests, 
and 
suffers 
of 
them 
with 
them!— 
Here 
man 
has 
been 
overcome 
at 
every 
moment; 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“overman” 
has 
here 
become 
the 
greatest 
reality—whatever 
was 
so 
far 
considered 
great 
in 
man 
lies 
beneath 
him 
at 
an 
infinite 
distance. 
The 
halcyon, 
the 
light 
feet, 
the 
omnipresence 
of 
malice 
and 
exuberance, 
and 
whatever 
else 
is 
typical 
of 
the 
type 
of 
Zarathustra—none 
of 
this 
has 
ever 
before 
been 
dreamed 
of 
as 
essential 
to 
greatness. 
Precisely 
in 
this 
width 
of 
space 
and 
this 
accessibility 
for 
what 
is 
contradictory, 
Zarathustra 
experiences 
himself 
as 
the 
supreme 
type 
of 
all 
beings; 
and 
once 
one 
hears 
how 
he 
defines 
this, 
one 
will 
refrain 
from 
seeking 
any 
metaphor 
for 
it.4 


“The 
soul 
that 
has 
the 
longest 
ladder 
and 
reaches 
down 
deepest—the 
most 
comprehensive 
soul, 
which 
can 
run 
and 
stray 
and 
roam 
farthest 
within 
itself; 
the 
most 
necessary 
soul 
that 
plunges 
joyously 
into 
chance; 
the 
soul 
that, 
having 
being, 
dives 
into 
becoming; 
the 
soul 
that 
has, 
but 
wants 
to 
want 
and 
will; 
the 
soul 
that 
flees 
itself 
and 
catches 
up 
with 
itself 
in 
the 
widest 
circles; 
the 
wisest 
soul 
that 
folly 
exhorts 
most 
sweetly; 
the 
soul 
that 
loves 
itself 
most, 
in 
which 
all 
things 
have 
their 
sweep 
and 
countersweep 
and 
ebb 
and 
flood 
——”5 


But 
that 
is 
the 
concept 
of 
Dionysus 
himself.— 
Another 
consideration 
leads 
to 
the 
very 
same 
result. 
The 
psychological 
problem 
in 
the 
type 
of 
Zarathustra 
is 
how 
he 
that 
says 
No 
and 
does 
No 
to 
an 
unheard-of 
degree, 
to 
everything 
to 
which 
one 
has 
so 
far 
said 
Yes, 
can 
nevertheless 
be 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
No-
saying 
spirit; 
how 
the 
spirit 
who 
bears 
the 
heaviest 
fate, 
a 
fatality 
of 
a 
task, 
can 
nevertheless 
be 
the 
lightest 
and 
most 
transcendent—Zarathustra 
is 
a 
dancer—how 
he 
that 
has 
the 
hardest, 
most 
terrible 
insight 
into 
reality, 
that 
has 
thought 
the 
“most 
abysmal 
idea,” 
nevertheless 
does 
not 
consider 
it 
an 
objection 
to 
existence, 
not 
even 
to 
its 
eternal 
recurrence—but 
rather 
one 
reason 
more 
for 
being 
himself 
the 
eternal 
Yes 
to 
all 
things, 
“the 
tremendous, 
unbounded 
saying 
Yes 
and 
Amen.”6— 
“Into 
all 
abysses 
I 
still 
carry 
the 
blessings 
of 
my 
saying 
Yes.”— 
But 
this 
is 
the 
concept 
of 
Dionysus 
once 
again. 



7 


What 
language 
will 
such 
a 
spirit 
speak 
when 
he 
speaks 
to 
himself? 
The 
language 
of 
the 
dithyramb. 
I 
am 
the 
inventor 
of 
the 
dithyramb. 
Listen 
to 
how 
Zarathustra 
speaks 
to 
himself 
before 
sunrise: 
such 
emerald 
happiness, 
such 
divine 
tenderness 
did 
not 
have 
a 
tongue 
before 
me. 
Even 
the 
deepest 
melancholy 
of 
such 
a 
Dionysus 
still 
turns 
into 
a 
dithyramb. 
To 
give 
some 
indication 
of 
this, 
I 
choose 
the 
“Night 
Song,” 
the 
immortal 
lament 
at 
being 
condemned 
by 
the 
overabundance 
of 
light 
and 
power, 
by 
his 
sun-nature, 
not 
to 
love. 


Night 
has 
come; 
now 
all 
fountains 
speak 
more 
loudly. 
And 
my 
soul, 
too, 
is 
a 
fountain. 
Night 
has 
come; 
only 
now 
all 
the 
songs 
of 
lovers 
awaken. 
And 
my 
soul, 
too, 
is 
the 
song 
of 
a 
lover. 
Something 
unstilled, 
unstillable 
is 
within 
me; 
it 
wants 
to 
be 
voiced. 
A 
craving 
for 
love 
is 
within 
me; 
it 
speaks 
the 
language 
of 
love. 


Light 
am 
I; 
ah, 
that 
I 
were 
night! 
But 
this 
is 
my 
loneliness 
that 
I 
am 
girt 
with 
light. 
Ah, 
that 
I 
were 
dark 
and 
nocturnal! 
How 
I 
would 
suck 
at 
the 
breasts 
of 
light! 
And 
even 
you 
would 
I 
bless, 
you 
little 
sparkling 
stars 
and 
glowworms 
up 
there, 
and 
be 
overjoyed 
with 
your 
gifts 
of 
light. 


But 
I 
live 
in 
my 
own 
light; 
I 
drink 
back 
into 
myself 
the 
flames 
that 
break 
out 
of 
me. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
the 
happiness 
of 
those 
who 
receive; 
and 
I 
have 
often 
dreamed 
that 
even 
stealing 
must 
be 
more 
blessed 
than 
receiving. 
This 
is 
my 
poverty, 
that 
my 
hand 
never 
rests 
from 
giving; 
this 
is 
my 
envy, 
that 
I 
see 
waiting 
eyes 
and 
the 
lit-up 
nights 
of 
longing. 
Oh, 
wretchedness 
of 
all 
givers! 
Oh, 
darkening 
of 
my 
sun! 
Oh, 
craving 
to 
crave! 
Oh, 
ravenous 
hunger 
in 
satiation! 


They 
receive 
from 
me, 
but 
do 
I 
touch 
their 
souls? 
There 
is 
a 
cleft 
between 
giving 
and 
receiving; 
and 
the 
narrowest 
cleft 
is 
the 
last 
to 
be 
bridged. 
A 
hunger 
grows 
out 
of 
my 
beauty: 
I 
should 
like 
to 
hurt 
those 
for 
whom 
I 
shine; 
I 
should 
like 
to 
rob 
those 
to 
whom 
I 
give; 
thus 
do 
I 
hunger 
for 
malice. 
To 
withdraw 
my 
hand 
when 
the 
other 
hand 
already 
reaches 
out 
to 
it; 
to 
linger 
like 
the 
waterfall, 
which 
lingers 
even 
while 
it 



plunges: 
thus 
do 
I 
hunger 
for 
malice. 
Such 
revenge 
my 
fullness 
plots: 
such 
spite 
wells 
up 
out 
of 
my 
loneliness. 
My 
happiness 
in 
giving 
died 
in 
giving; 
my 
virtue 
tired 
of 
itself 
in 
its 
overflow. 


The 
danger 
of 
those 
who 
always 
give 
is 
that 
they 
lose 
their 
sense 
of 
shame; 
and 
the 
heart 
and 
hand 
of 
those 
who 
always 
mete 
out 
become 
callous 
from 
always 
meting 
out. 
My 
eye 
no 
longer 
wells 
over 
at 
the 
shame 
of 
those 
who 
beg; 
my 
hand 
has 
grown 
too 
hard 
for 
the 
trembling 
of 
filled 
hands. 
Where 
have 
the 
tears 
of 
my 
eyes 
gone 
and 
the 
down 
of 
my 
heart? 
Oh, 
the 
loneliness 
of 
all 
givers! 
Oh, 
the 
taciturnity 
of 
all 
who 
shine! 


Many 
suns 
revolve 
in 
the 
void: 
to 
all 
that 
is 
dark 
they 
speak 
with 
their 
light—to 
me 
they 
are 
silent. 
Oh, 
this 
is 
the 
enmity 
of 
the 
light 
against 
what 
shines: 
merciless 
it 
moves 
in 
its 
orbit. 
Unjust 
in 
its 
heart 
against 
all 
that 
shines, 
cold 
against 
suns—thus 
moves 
every 
sun. 


The 
suns 
fly 
like 
a 
storm 
in 
their 
orbits: 
that 
is 
their 
motion. 
They 
follow 
their 
inexorable 
will: 
that 
is 
their 
coldness. 


Oh, 
it 
is 
only 
you, 
you 
dark 
ones, 
you 
nocturnal 
ones, 
who 
create 
warmth 
out 
of 
that 
which 
shines. 
It 
is 
only 
you 
who 
drink 
milk 
and 
refreshment 
out 
of 
the 
udders 
of 
light. 


Alas, 
ice 
is 
all 
around 
me, 
my 
hand 
is 
burned 
by 
the 
ice. 
Alas, 
thirst 
is 
within 
me 
that 
languishes 
after 
your 
thirst. 


Night 
has 
come: 
alas, 
that 
I 
must 
be 
light! 
And 
thirst 
for 
the 
nocturnal! 
And 
loneliness! 


Night 
has 
come: 
now 
my 
craving 
breaks 
out 
of 
me 
like 
a 
well; 
to 
speak 
I 
crave. 


Night 
has 
come; 
now 
all 
fountains 
speak 
more 
loudly. 
And 
my 
soul, 
too, 
is 
a 
fountain. 


Night 
has 
come; 
now 
all 
the 
songs 
of 
lovers 
awaken. 
And 
my 
soul, 
too, 
is 
the 
song 
of 
a 
lover.

Nothing 
like 
this 
has 
ever 
been 
written, 
felt, 
or 
suffered: 
thus 
suffers 
a 
god, 
a 
Dionysus. 
The 
answer 
to 
such 
a 
dithyramb 
of 
solar 
solitude 
in 
the 
light 
would 
be 
Ariadne.— 
Who 
besides 
me 
knows 
what 
Ariadne 
is!— 
For 
all 
such 
riddles 
nobody 
so 
far 
had 
any 
solution; 
I 
doubt 
that 
anybody 
even 
saw 
any 
riddles 
here. 


Zarathustra 
once 
defines, 
quite 
strictly, 
his 
task—it 
is 
mine, 
too—and 
there 
is 
no 
mistaking 
his 
meaning: 
he 
says 
Yes 
to 
the 
point 
of 
justifying, 
of 
redeeming 
even 
all 
of 
the 
past. 


“I 
walk 
among 
men 
as 
among 
the 
fragments 
of 
the 
future—that 
future 
which 
I 
envisage. 
And 
this 
is 
all 
my 
creating 
and 
striving, 
that 
I 
create 
and 
carry 
together 
into 
One 
what 
is 
fragment 
and 
riddle 
and 
dreadful 
accident. 
And 
how 
could 
I 
bear 
to 
be 
a 
man 
if 
man 
were 
not 
also 
a 
creator 
and 
guesser 
of 
riddles 
and 
redeemer 
of 
accidents? 
To 
redeem 
those 
who 
lived 
in 
the 
past 
and 
to 
turn 
every 
‘it 
was’ 
into 
a 
‘thus 
I 
willed 
it’—that 
alone 
should 
I 
call 
redemption.”1 


In 
another 
passage 
he 
defines 
as 
strictly 
as 
possible 
what 
alone 
“man” 
can 
be 
for 
him—not 
an 
object 
of 
love 
or, 
worse, 
pity—Zarathustra 
has 
mastered 
the 
great 
nausea 
over 
man, 
too: 
man 
is 
for 
him 
an 
un-form, 
a 
material, 
an 
ugly 
stone 
that 
needs 
a 
sculptor. 


“Willing 
no 
more 
and 
esteeming 
no 
more 
and 
creating 
no 
more—oh, 
that 
this 
great 
weariness 
might 
always 
remain 
far 
from 
me! 
In 
knowledge, 
too, 
I 
feel 
only 
my 
will’s 
joy 
in 
begetting 
and 
becoming; 
and 
if 
there 
is 
innocence 
in 
my 
knowledge, 
it 
is 
because 
the 
will 
to 
beget 
is 
in 
it. 
Away 
from 
God 
and 
gods 
this 
will 
has 
lured 
me; 
what 
could 
one 
create 
if 
gods—were 
there? 


“But 
my 
fervent 
will 
to 
create 
impels 
me 
ever 
again 
toward 
man; 
thus 
is 
the 
hammer 
impelled 
toward 
the 
stone. 
O 
men, 
in 
the 
stone 
an 
image 
is 
sleeping, 
the 
image 
of 
images! 
Alas, 
that 
it 
has 
to 
sleep 
in 
the 
hardest, 
ugliest 
stone! 
Now 
my 
hammer 
rages 
cruelly 
against 
its 
prison. 
Pieces 
of 
rock 
rain 
from 
the 
stone: 
what 
is 
that 
to 
me? 
I 
want 
to 
perfect 
it; 
for 
a 
shadow 
came 
to 
me—the 
stillest 
and 
lightest 
of 
all 
things 
once 
came 
to 
me. 
The 
beauty 
of 
the 
overman 
came 
to 
me 
as 
a 
shadow. 
O 
my 
brothers, 
what 
are 
gods 
to 
me 



now?”2 
I 
stress 
a 
final 
point: 
the 
verse 
in 
italics 
furnishes 
the 
occasion. 
Among 
the 


conditions 
for 
a 
Dionysian 
task 
are, 
in 
a 
decisive 
way, 
the 
hardness 
of 
the 


hammer, 
the 
joy 
even 
in 
destroying. 
The 
imperative, 
“become 
hard!” 
the 
most 


fundamental 
certainty 
that 
all 
creators 
are 
hard,3 
is 
the 
distinctive 
mark 
of 
a 


Dionysian 
nature.

Clearly, 
the 
rock 
is 
not 
the 
one 
on 
the 
Chasté, 
a 
peninsula 
in 
the 
Silser 
See, 
on 
which 
a 
tablet 
with 
the 
text 
of 
the 
“Drunken 
Song” 
from 
Zarathustra 
IV 
(section 
12) 
has 
been 
fastened.

The 
manuscript 
sent 
to 
the 
printer 
(Druckmanuskript) 
was 
preserved 
in 
the 
Nietzsche 
Archive 
and 
characterized 
as 
follows 
by 
Hans 
Joachim 
Mette: 
“Autograph 
composition 
for 
a 
solo 
voice 
with 
piano 
accompaniment, 
written 
in 
August/September 
1882, 
based 
on 
a 
stanza 
of 
the, 
poem 
Prayer 
to 
Life 
by 
Lou 
Salomé: 
this 
very 
Lied 
was 
reworked 
by 
Peter 
Gast, 
who 
also 
took 
into 
account 
the 
second 
stanza, 
which 
Nietzsche 
presumably 
communicated 
to 
him—and 
was 
turned, 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
1887, 
into 
a 
Hymn 
to 
Life: 
Composition 
for 
Mixed 
Choir 
and 
Orchestra 
and 
published 
by 
him 
under 
this 
title 
over 
Nietzsche’s 
name, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
first 
edition, 
E 
39 
(cf. 
Friedrich

pp. 
366–68); 
music

Mette’s 
footnote 
reads: 
“*The

had 
been 
found 
already 
in 
1873/74 
for 
the

to 
Friendship”

In 
the 
MS, 
Nietzsche’s 
sister 
crossed 
out 
the 
last 
eleven 
words 
of 
this 
sentence, 
but 
they 
were 
printed 
nevertheless 
in 
1908, 
and 
in 
all 
subsequent 
editions 
(cf. 
Podach, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
pp. 
200 
and 
285).

Nietzsche 
originally 
wrote, 
“the 
unforgettable 
German 
Emperor” 
but 
then 
crossed 
out 
three 
words 
(Podach, 
p. 
286). 
When 
the 
first 
Emperor 
of 
the 
Second 
Reich, 
Wilhelm 
I, 
had 
died 
at 
ninety-one 
on 
March 
9, 
1888, 
his 
much 
more 
liberal 
son, 
Friedrich 
III, 
had 
succeeded 
him; 
but 
Friedrich 
died 
of 
cancer 
after 
a 
hundred 
days; 
June 
15, 
and 
was 
succeeded 
by 
his 
son, 
the 
last 
German 
Kaiser, 
Wilhelm 
II. 
It 
has 
often 
been 
surmised 
that 
European 
history 
might 
have 
taken 
a 
different 
turn 
if 
Friedrich 
III 
had 
lived 
longer. 
On 
June 
20 
Nietzsche 
had 
written 
Gast: 
“The 
death 
of 
Kaiser 
Friedrich 
has 
moved 
me: 
in 
the 
end 
he 
was 
a 
small 
glimmering 
light 
of 
free 
thought, 
the 
last 
hope 
for 
Germany. 
Now 
the 
rule 
of 
Stöcker 
begins: 
I 
project 
the 
consequence 
and 
already 
know 
that 
now 
my 
Will 
to 
Power 
will 
be 
confiscated 
in 
Germany 
first 
of 
all.” 
Hofprediger 
(Court 
Chaplain) 
Stöcker 
was 
the 
leading 
German 
anti-
Semite 
of 
that 
period. 
The 
Will 
to 
Power 
was 
then 
no 
more 
than 
a 
project 
for 
which 
Niezsche 
had 
accumulated 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
material, 
and 
the 
work 
now 
known 
under 
this 
striking 
title 
is 
merely 
a 
posthumously 
published 
collection 
of 
many 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
most 
interesting 
notes. 
Still, 
this 
letter 
shows—along 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
evidence—how 
the 
title 
was 
not 
meant, 
and 
how 
thoroughly 
Nietzsche’s 
intentions 
and 
spirit 
differed 
from 
those 
of 
the 
last 
Kaiser.

The

aphorism 
of 
Book 
IV, 
which 
concluded 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
The 
Gay 
Science, 
had 
been 
entitled 
Incipit

(the 
tragedy 
begins) 
and 
was 
reused 
as 
the 
first 
section 
of 
the 
Prologue 
of 
Zarathustra. 
The 
reference 
to 
“parody” 
in 
the 
sentence 
above 
is 
a 
reminder 
that 
Nietzsche’s 
occasional 
pathos 
in 
Zarathustra 
and 
Ecce 
Homo 
is 
not 
devoid 
of 
irony:

the 
opening 
paragraph 
of 
section 
4 
of 
“Why 
I 
Am 
So

“Arches

and 
“wide

are 
in 
the 
original

and 
the 
word 
for 
tension 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
sentence 
and 
also 
a 
little 
earlier 
is 
Spannung.

almost 
one

and 
instead 
of

“me.”

Nietzsche 
himself 
might 
well 
have 
struck 
them 
out 
on 
rereading 
them: 
“In

I 
had 
the

Parsifal

twice 
I

In 
a 
discarded 
draft 
we 
find 
the 
following 
passage: 
“The 
psychologist 
still 
adds 
that 
there 
are 
no 
conditions 
in 
which 
one’s 
defenselessness 
and 
lack 
of 
protection 
are 
greater. 
If 
there 
are 
any 
means 
at 
all 
for 
destroying 
[umzubringen] 
men 
who 
are 
destinies, 
the 
instinct 
of 
poisonous 
flies 
discerns 
these 
means. 
For 
one 
who 
has 
greatness 
there 
is 
no 
fight 
with 
the 
small: 
hence 
the 
small 
become 
masters” 
(Podach, 
pp. 
291f.).

of

This

i.e.: 
seeking 
his 
equal.

Nietzsche’s 
omission 
of 
the 
words: 
“how

most

And 
where 
Nietzsche 
has 
a 
double 
dash, 
Zarathustra 
concludes: 
“oh,

The 
task 
for 
the 
years 
that 
followed 
now 
was 
indicated 
as 
clearly 
as 
possible. 
After 
the 
Yes-saying 
part 
of 
my 
task 
had 
been 
solved, 
the 
turn 
had 
come 
for 
the 
No-saying, 
No-doing 
part: 
the 
revaluation 
of 
our 
values 
so 
far, 
the 
great 
war—conjuring 
up 
a 
day 
of 
decision. 
This 
included 
the 
slow 
search 
for 
those 
related 
to 
me, 
those 
who, 
prompted 
by 
strength, 
would 
offer 
me 
their 
hands 
for 
destroying. 


From 
this 
moment 
forward 
all 
my 
writings 
are 
fish 
hooks: 
perhaps 
I 
know 
how 
to 
fish 
as 
well 
as 
anyone?— 
If 
nothing 
was 
caught, 
I 
am 
not 
to 
blame. 
There 
were 
no 
fish.

This 
book 
(1886) 
is 
in 
all 
essentials 
a 
critique 
of 
modernity, 
not 
excluding 
the 
modern 
sciences, 
modern 
arts, 
and 
even 
modern 
politics, 
along 
with 
pointers 
to 
a 
contrary 
type 
that 
is 
as 
little 
modern 
as 
possible—a 
noble, 
Yes-
saying 
type. 
In 
the 
latter 
sense, 
the 
book 
is 
a 
school 
for 
the 
gentilhomme,1 
taking 
this 
concept 
in 
a 
more 
spiritual 
and 
radical 
sense 
than 
has 
ever 
been 
done. 
One 
has 
to 
have 
guts 
merely 
to 
endure 
it; 
one 
must 
never 
have 
learned 
how 
to 
be 
afraid. 


All 
those 
things 
of 
which 
our 
age 
is 
proud 
are 
experienced 
as 
contradictions 
to 
this 
type, 
almost 
as 
bad 
manners; 
our 
famous 
“objectivity,” 
for 
example; 
“pity 
for 
all 
that 
suffers”; 
the 
“historical 
sense” 
with 
its 
submission 
to 
foreign 
tastes, 
groveling 
on 
its 
belly 
before 
petits 
faits,2 
and 
“being 
scientific.” 


When 
you 
consider 
that 
this 
book 
followed 
after 
Zarathustra, 
you 
may 
perhaps 
also 
guess 
the 
dietetic 
regimen 
to 
which 
it 
owes 
its 
origin. 
The 
eye 
that 
had 
been 
spoiled 
by 
the 
tremendous 
need 
for 
seeing 
far—Zarathustra 
is 
even 
more 
far-sighted 
than 
the 
Tsar—is 
here 
forced 
to 
focus 
on 
what 
lies 
nearest, 
the 
age, 
the 
around-us. 
In 
every 
respect, 
above 
all 
also 
in 
the 
form, 
you 
will 
find 
the 
same 
deliberate 
turning 
away 
from 
the 
instincts 
that 
had 
made 
possible 
a 
Zarathustra. 
The 
refinement 
in 
form, 
in 
intention, 
in 
the 
art 
of 
silence 
is 
in 
the 
foreground; 
psychology 
is 
practiced 
with 
admitted 
hardness 
and 
cruelty—the 
book 
is 
devoid 
of 
any 
good-natured 
word. 


All 
this 
is 
a 
recuperation: 
who 
would 
guess 
after 
all 
what 
sort 
of 
recuperation 
such 
a 
squandering 
of 
good-naturedness 
as 
Zarathustra 
represents 
makes 
necessary? 


Theologically 
speaking—listen 
closely, 
for 
I 
rarely 
speak 
as 
a 
theologian 
—it 
was 
God 
himself 
who 
at 
the 
end 
of 
his 
days’ 
work 
lay 
down 
as 
a 
serpent 
under 
the 
tree 
of 
knowledge: 
thus 
he 
recuperated 
from 
being 
God.— 
He 
had 
made 
everything 
too 
beautiful.3 
— 
The 
devil 
is 
merely 
the 
leisure 
of 
God 
on 
that 
seventh 
day.

Genealogy 
of 
Morals 


A 
Polemic 


Regarding 
expression, 
intention, 
and 
the 
art 
of 
surprise, 
the 
three 
inquiries 
which 
constitute 
this 
Genealogy 
are 
perhaps 
uncannier 
than 
anything 
else 
written 
so 
far. 
Dionysus 
is, 
as 
is 
known, 
also 
the 
god 
of 
darkness. 


Every 
time 
a 
beginning 
that 
is 
calculated 
to 
mislead: 
cool, 
scientific, 
even 
ironic, 
deliberately 
foreground, 
deliberately 
holding 
off. 
Gradually 
more 
unrest; 
sporadic 
lightning; 
very 
disagreeable 
truths 
are 
heard 
grumbling 
in 
the 
distance—until 
eventually 
a 
tempo 
feroce 
is 
attained 
in 
which 
everything 
rushes 
ahead 
in 
a 
tremendous 
tension. 
In 
the 
end, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
perfectly 
gruesome 
detonations, 
a 
new 
truth 
becomes 
visible 
every 
time 
among 
thick 
clouds. 


The 
truth 
of 
the 
first 
inquiry 
is 
the 
birth 
of 
Christianity: 
the 
birth 
of 
Christianity 
out 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
ressentiment, 
not, 
as 
people 
may 
believe, 
out 
of 
the 
“spirit”—a 
countermovement 
by 
its 
very 
nature, 
the 
great 
rebellion 
against 
the 
dominion 
of 
noble 
values. 


The 
second 
inquiry 
offers 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
conscience—which 
is 
not, 
as 
people 
may 
believe, 
“the 
voice 
of 
God 
in 
man”: 
it 
is 
the 
instinct 
of 
cruelty 
that 
turns 
back 
after 
it 
can 
no 
longer 
discharge 
itself 
externally. 
Cruelty 
is 
here 
exposed 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
and 
basic 
substrata 
of 
culture 
that 
simply 
cannot 
be 
imagined 
away. 


The 
third 
inquiry 
offers 
the 
answer 
to 
the 
question 
whence 
the 
ascetic 
ideal, 
the 
priests’ 
ideal, 
derives 
its 
tremendous 
power 
although 
it 
is 
the 
harmful 
ideal 
par 
excellence, 
a 
will 
to 
the 
end, 
an 
ideal 
of 
decadence. 
Answer: 
not, 
as 
people 
may 
believe, 
because 
God

it 
was 
the 
only 
ideal 
so 
far, 
because 
it 
had 
no 
rival. 
“For 
man 
would 
rather 
will 
even 
nothingness 
than 
not 
will.”2— 
Above 
all, 
a 
counterideal 
was 
lacking—until 
Zarathustra.

Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols 


How 
One 
Philosophizes 
with 
a 
Hammer1 



1 


This 
essay 
of 
less 
than 
150 
pages,2 
cheerful 
and 
ominous 
in 
tone, 
a 
demon 
that 
laughs—the 
work 
of 
so 
few 
days 
that 
I 
hesitate 
to 
mention 
how 
many, 
is 
an 
exception 
among 
books: 
there 
is 
none 
richer 
in 
substance, 
more 
independent, 
more 
subversive3—more 
evil. 
If 
you 
want 
a 
quick 
idea 
how 
before 
me 
everything 
stood 
on 
its 
head,4 
begin 
with 
this 
essay. 
What 
is 
called 
idol 
on 
the 
title 
page 
is 
simply 
what 
has 
been 
called 
truth 
so 
far. 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols—that 
is: 
the 
old 
truth 
is 
approaching 
its 
end. 



2 


There 
is 
no 
reality, 
no 
“ideality” 
that 
is 
not 
touched 
in 
this 
essay 
(touched: 
what 
a 
cautious 
euphemism!). 
Not 
only 
eternal 
idols, 
also 
the 
youngest 
which 
are 
therefore 
feeblest 
on 
account 
of 
their 
age. 
“Modern 
ideas,” 
for 
example. 
A 
great 
wind 
blows 
among 
the 
trees, 
and 
everywhere 
fruit 
fall 
down—truths. 
The 
squandering 
of 
an 
all-too-rich 
autumn: 
one 
stumbles 
over 
truths, 
one 
steps 
on 
and 
kills 
a 
few—there 
are 
too 
many. 


But 
what 
we 
get 
hold 
of 
is 
no 
longer 
anything 
questionable 
but 
rather 
decisions. 
I 
am 
the 
first 
to 
hold 
in 
my 
hands 
the 
measure 
for 
“truths”; 
I 
am 
the 
first 
who 
is 
able 
to 
decide. 
Just 
as 
if 
a 
second 
consciousness 
had 
grown 
in 
me; 
just 
as 
if 
“the 
will” 
had 
kindled 
a 
light 
for 
itself 
in 
me 
so 
that 
it 
might 
see 
the 
inclined 
plane, 
the 
askew 
path5 
on 
which 
it 
went 
down 
so 
far.— 
The 
askew 
path—people 
called 
it 
the 
way 
to 
“truth.” 


It 
is 
all 
over 
with 
all 
“darkling 
aspiration”; 
precisely 
the 
good 
man 
was 
least 
aware 
of 
the 
right 
way.6— 
And 
in 
all 
seriousness: 
nobody 
before 
me 
knew 
the 
right 
way, 
the 
way 
up; 
it 
is 
only 
beginning 
with 
me 
that 
there 
are 
hopes 
again, 
tasks, 
ways 
that 
can 
be 
prescribed 
for 
culture—I 
am 
he 
that 
brings 
these 
glad 
tidings.— 
And 
thus 
I 
am 
also 
a 
destiny.— 



3 


Immediately 
upon 
finishing 
this 
work, 
without 
losing 
even 
one 
day, 
I 
attacked 
the 
tremendous 
task 
of 
the 
Revaluation,1 
with 
a 
sovereign 
feeling 
of 
pride 
that 
was 
incomparable, 
certain 
at 
every 
moment 
of 
my 
immortality, 
engraving 
sign 
upon 
sign 
on 
bronze 
tablets 
with 
the 
sureness 
of 
a 
destiny. 
The 
Preface 
was 
written 
on 
September 
3, 
1888: 
when 
I 
stepped 
outdoors 
the 
morning 
after, 
I 
saw 
the 
most 
beautiful 
day 
that 
the 
Upper 
Engadine 
ever 
showed 
me—transparent, 
the 
colors 
glowing, 
including 
all 
opposites, 
everything 
that 
lies 
between 
ice 
and 
south. 


It 
was 
only 
on 
September 
20 
that 
I 
left 
Sils 
Maria, 
detained 
by 
floods—in 
the 
end 
by 
far 
the 
only 
guest 
of 
this 
wonderful 
place 
on 
which 
my 
gratitude 
wants 
to 
bestow 
an 
immortal 
name. 
After 
a 
journey 
with 
incidents, 
including 
some 
danger 
to 
my 
life 
in 
Como, 
which 
was 
flooded—I 
got 
there 
only 
late 
at 
night—I 
reached 
Turin 
on 
the 
afternoon 
of 
the 
21st—my 
proven 
place, 
my 
residence 
from 
now 
on. 
I 
took 
the 
same 
apartment 
I 
had 
occupied 
in 
the 
spring, 
Via 
Carlo 
Alberto 
6, 
fourth 
floor, 
opposite 
the 
imposing 
Palazzo 
Carignano 
in 
which 
Vittorio 
Emanuele2 
was 
born, 
with 
a 
view 
of 
the 
Piazza 
Carlo 
Alberto 
and 
of 
the 
hills 
beyond. 
Without 
hesitation 
and 
without 
permitting 
myself 
to 
be 
distracted 
for 
a 
moment, 
I 
went 
back 
to 
work: 
only 
the 
final 
quarter 
of 
the 
work 
remained 
to 
be 
done. 
On 
the 
30th 
of 
September, 
great 
victory; 
seventh 
day; 
the 
leisure 
of 
a 
god 
walking 
along 
the 
Po 
river.3 
On 
the 
same 
day 
I 
wrote 
the 
Preface 
for 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols:4 
correcting 
the 
printer’s 
proofs 
of 
that 
book 
had 
been 
my 
recreation 
in 
September. 


Never 
have 
I 
experienced 
such 
an 
autumn, 
nor 
considered 
anything 
of 
the 
sort 
possible 
on 
earth—a 
Claude 
Lorrain5 
projected 
into 
the 
infinite, 
every 
day 
of 
the 
same 
indomitable 
perfection. 


1 
For 
the 
meaning 
of 
this 
famous 
phrase, 
see 
the 
Preface 
to 
the 
book: 
“… 
not 
just 
idols 
of 
the 
age, 
but 
eternal 
idols, 
which 
are 
here 
touched 
with 
a 
hammer 
as 
with 
a 
tuning 
fork: 
there 
are 
… 
none 
more 
hollow.”

Umwerfenderes: 
literally, 
more 
overthrowing.

Nietzsche’s 
revaluation, 
like 
Marx’s 
correction 
of 
Hegel, 
represents 
an 
attempt 
to 
put 
things 
right-side 
up 
again. 
Yet 
Nietzsche 
and 
Marx 
have 
usually 
been 
misrepresented 
as 
if 
they 
had 
boasted 
that 
they 
had 
stood 
everything 
on 
its 
head. 


5 
Here 
six 
words 
have 
been 
used 
to 
render 
die 
schiefe 
Bahn; 
in 
the 
next 
sentence, 
only 
three 
words. 
The 
ordinary 
German 
reader 
would 
assume 
at 
first 
that 
an 
inclined 
plane 
was 
meant; 
then, 
coming 
to 
the 
second 
occurrence 
of 
schiefe, 
emphasized 
by 
Nietzsche, 
he 
would 
interpret 
it 
as 
askew, 
crooked.

When 
he 
wrote 
the

still 
intended 
to 
call

Müssiggang

(a

A 
letter 
from 
Peter 
Gast 
(cited 
in 
Portable 
Nietzsche, 
p. 
464), 
asking 
for 
a 
less 
unassuming 
title, 
changed 
Nietzsche’s 
mind. 
The 
book 
appeared 
with 
the 
new 
title 
in 
January 
1889, 
a 
few 
days 
after 
Nietzsche’s 
collapse. 
The

of

with 
respect 
to 
these 
two 
books, 
Nietzsche 
does 
not 
adhere 
to 
the 
chronological 
order. 
The 
Antichrist, 
which 
is 
not 
reviewed 
here 
by 
Nietzsche, 
and

after 
Ecce

The 
Case 
of

A 
Musician’s 
Problem 



1 


To 
do 
justice 
to 
this 
essay, 
one 
has 
to 
suffer 
of 
the 
fate 
of 
music 
as 
of 
an 
open 
wound.— 
Of 
what 
do 
I 
suffer 
when 
I 
suffer 
of 
the 
fate 
of 
music? 
That 
music 
has 
been 
done 
out 
of 
its 
world-transfiguring, 
Yes-saying 
character, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
music 
of 
decadence 
and 
no 
longer 
the 
flute 
of 
Dionysus. 


Assuming, 
however, 
that 
a 
reader 
experiences 
the 
cause 
of 
music 
in 
this 
way 
as 
his 
own 
cause, 
as 
the 
history 
of 
his 
own 
sufferings, 
he 
will 
find 
this 
essay 
full 
of 
consideration 
and 
exceedingly 
mild. 
To 
be 
cheerful 
in 
such 
cases, 
genially 
mocking 
oneself, 
too—ridendo 
dicere 
severum1 
when 
the 
verum 
dicere 
would 
justify 
any 
amount 
of 
hardness—is 
humanity 
itself. 
Does 
anyone 
really 
doubt 
that 
I, 
as 
the 
old 
artillerist 
I 
am,2 
could 
easily 
bring 
up 
my 
heavy 
guns 
against 
Wagner?— 
Everything 
decisive 
in 
this 
matter 
I 
held 
back—I 
have 
loved 
Wagner. 


Ultimately, 
an 
attack 
on 
a 
subtler 
“unknown 
one,” 
whom 
nobody 
else 
is 
likely 
to 
guess, 
is 
part 
of 
the 
meaning 
and 
way 
of 
my 
task—oh, 
I 
can 
uncover 
“unknown 
ones” 
who 
are 
in 
an 
altogether 
different 
category 
from 
a 
Cagliostro3 
of 
music—even 
more, 
to 
be 
sure, 
an 
attack 
on 
the 
German 
nation 
which 
is 
becoming 
ever 
lazier 
and 
more 
impoverished 
in 
its 
instincts, 
ever 
more 
honest, 
and 
which 
continues 
with 
an 
enviable 
appetite 
to 
feed 
on 
opposites, 
gobbling 
down 
without 
any 
digestive 
troubles 
“faith” 
as 
well 
as 
scientific 
manners,4 
“Christian 
love” 
as 
well 
as 
anti-Semitism, 
the 
will 
to 
power 
(to 
the 
Reich) 
as 
well 
as 
the 
évangile 
des 
humbles.5 
— 
Such 
a 
failure 
to 
take 
sides 
among 
opposites! 
Such 
neutrality 
and 
“selflessness” 
of 
the 
stomach! 
This 
sense 
of 
justice 
of 
the 
German 
palate 
that 
finds 
all 
causes 
just 
and 
accords 
all 
equal 
rights6— 
that 
finds 
everything 
tasty.— 
Beyond 
a 
doubt, 
the 
Germans 
are 
idealists. 


When 
I 
visited 
Germany 
last, 
I 
found 
the 
German 
taste 
exerting 
itself 
to 
concede 
equal 
rights 
to 
Wagner 
and 
to 
the 
Trumpeter 
of 
Säkkingen;7 
I 
myself 
witnessed 
how 
a 
Liszt 
Society 
was 
founded 
in 
Leipzig, 
for 
the 
cultivation 
and 
propagation 
of 
insidious8 
church 
music, 
ostensibly 
in 
honor 
of 
one 
of 
the 
most 
genuine 
and 
German 
musicians—German 
in 
the 
old 
sense 
of 
that 
word, 



no 
mere 
Reichsdeutscher—the 
old 
master 
Heinrich 
Schütz.— 
Beyond 
a 
doubt, 
the 
Germans 
are 
idealists.9 



2 


But 
here 
nothing 
shall 
keep 
me 
from 
becoming 
blunt 
and 
telling 
the 
Germans 
a 
few 
hard 
truths: 
who 
else 
would 
do 
it? 


I 
speak 
of 
their 
indecency 
in 
historicis. 
Not 
only 
have 
the 
German 
historians 
utterly 
lost 
the 
great 
perspective 
for 
the 
course 
and 
the 
values 
of 
culture; 
nor 
are 
they 
merely, 
without 
exception, 
buffoons 
of 
politics 
(or 
the 
church)—but 
they 
have 
actually 
proscribed 
this 
great 
perspective. 
One 
must 
first 
be 
“German” 
and 
have 
“race,” 
then 
one 
can 
decide 
about 
all 
values 
and 
disvalues 
in 
historicis—one 
determines 
them. 


“German” 
has 
become 
an 
argument, 
Deutschland, 
Deutschland 
über 
alles1 
a 
principle; 
the 
Teutons 
represent 
the 
“moral 
world 
order” 
in 
history—the 
carriers 
of 
freedom 
versus 
the 
imperium 
Romanum, 
and 
the 
restoration 
of 
morality 
and 
the 
“categorical 
imperative”2 
versus 
the 
eighteenth 
century.— 
There 
is 
now 
a 
historiography 
that 
is 
reichsdeutsch; 
there 
is 
even, 
I 
fear, 
an 
anti-Semitic 
one—there 
is 
a 
court 
historiography, 
and 
Herr 
von 
Treitschke 
is 
not 
ashamed—3 


Recently 
an 
idiotic4 
judgment 
in 
historicis, 
a 
proposition 
of 
the 
fortunately 
late 
aesthetic 
Swabian, 
Vischer,5 
was 
repeated 
in 
one 
German 
newspaper 
after 
another, 
as 
a 
“truth” 
to 
which 
every 
German 
has 
to 
say 
Yes: 
“The 
Renaissance 
and 
the 
Reformation—only 
the 
two 
together 
make 
a 
whole: 
the 
aesthetic 
rebirth 
and 
the 
moral 
rebirth.” 


When 
I 
read 
such 
sentences, 
my 
patience 
is 
exhausted 
and 
I 
feel 
the 
itch, 
I 
even 
consider 
it 
a 
duty, 
to 
tell 
the 
Germans 
for 
once 
how 
many 
things 
they 
have 
on 
their 
conscience 
by 
now.6 
All 
great 
crimes 
against 
culture 
for 
four 
centuries 
they 
have 
on 
their 
conscience.— 
And 
the 
reason 
is 
always 
the 
same: 
their 
innermost 
cowardice 
before 
reality, 
which 
is 
also 
cowardice 
before 
the 
truth; 
their 
untruthfulness 
which 
has 
become 
instinctive 
with 
them; 
their 
“idealism.” 


The 
Germans 
did 
Europe 
out 
of 
the 
harvest, 
the 
meaning, 
of 
the 
last 
great 
age, 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Renaissance, 
at 
a 
moment 
when 
a 
higher 
order 
of 
values, 
the 
noble 
ones, 
those 
that 
say 
Yes 
to 
life, 
those 
that 
guarantee 
the 
future, 
had 
triumphed 
at 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
opposite 
values, 
those 
of 
decline—even 
in 
the 



very 
instincts 
of 
those 
who 
were 
sitting 
there. 
Luther, 
this 
calamity 
of 
a 
monk, 
restored 
the 
church 
and, 
what 
is 
a 
thousand 
times 
worse, 
Christianity, 
at 
the 
very 
moment 
when 
it 
was 
vanquished.— 
Christianity, 
this 
denial 
of 
the 
will 
to 
life 
become 
religion!— 
Luther, 
an 
impossible 
monk 
who, 
on 
account 
of 
his 
own 
“impossibility,” 
attacked 
the 
church 
and—consequently—restored 
it.— 
The 
Catholics 
would 
have 
good 
reasons 
to 
celebrate 
Luther 
festivals, 
to 
write 
Luther 
plays.— 
Luther—and 
the 
“moral 
rebirth”! 
To 
hell 
with 
psychology!7— 
Beyond 
a 
doubt, 
the 
Germans 
are 
idealists. 


Twice, 
when 
an 
honest, 
unequivocal, 
perfectly 
scientific 
way 
of 
thinking 
had 
just 
been 
attained 
with 
tremendous 
fortitude 
and 
self-overcoming, 
the 
Germans 
managed 
to 
find 
devious 
paths 
to 
the 
old 
“ideal,” 
reconciliations 
of 
truth 
and 
“ideal”—at 
bottom, 
formulas 
for 
a 
right 
to 
repudiate 
science, 
a 
right 
to 
lie. 
Leibniz 
and 
Kant—these 
two 
greatest 
brake 
shoes 
of 
intellectual 
integrity 
in 
Europe! 


Finally, 
when 
on 
the 
bridge 
between 
two 
centuries 
of 
decadence, 
a 
force 
majeure8 
of 
genius 
and 
will 
became 
visible, 
strong 
enough 
to 
create 
a 
unity 
out 
of 
Europe, 
a 
political 
and 
economic 
unity 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
a 
world 
government—the 
Germans 
with 
their 
“Wars 
of 
Liberation” 
did 
Europe 
out 
of 
the 
meaning, 
the 
miracle 
of 
meaning 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
Napoleon; 
hence 
they 
have 
on 
their 
conscience 
all 
that 
followed, 
that 
is 
with 
us 
today—this 
most 
anti-cultural 
sickness 
and 
unreason 
there 
is, 
nationalism, 
this 
névrose 
nationale9 
with 
which 
Europe 
is 
sick, 
this 
perpetuation 
of 
European 
particularism, 
of 
petty 
politics:10 
they 
have 
deprived 
Europe 
itself 
of 
its 
meaning, 
of 
its 
reason—they 
have 
driven 
it 
into 
a 
dead-end 
street.11— 
Does 
anyone 
besides 
me 
know 
the 
way 
out 
of 
this 
dead-end 
street?— 
A 
task 
that 
is 
great 
enough 
to 
unite 
nations 
again? 



3 


And 
in 
the 
end, 
why 
should 
I 
not 
voice 
my 
suspicion? 
In 
my 
case, 
too, 
the 
Germans 
will 
try 
everything 
to 
bring 
forth 
from 
a 
tremendous 
destiny—a 
mouse. 
So 
far 
they 
have 
compromised 
themselves 
in 
my 
case; 
I 
doubt 
that 
they 
will 
do 
any 
better 
in 
the 
future.— 
Ah, 
how 
I 
wish 
I 
were 
a 
bad 
prophet 
in 
this 
case!— 
My 
natural 
readers 
and 
listeners 
are 
even 
now 
Russians, 
Scandinavians, 
and 
Frenchmen—will 
it 
always 
be 
that 
way? 


In 
the 
history 
of 
the 
quest 
for 
knowledge 
the 
Germans 
are 
inscribed 
with 
nothing 
but 
ambiguous 
names; 
they 
have 
always 
brought 
forth 
only 
“unconscious” 
counterfeiters 
(Fichte, 
Schelling, 
Schopenhauer, 
Hegel, 
and 
Schleiermacher 
deserve 
this 
epithet 
as 
well 
as 
Kant 
and 
Leibniz: 
they 
are 
all 
mere 
veil 
makers):1 
they 
shall 
never 
enjoy 
the 
honor 
that 
the 
first 
honest 
spirit 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
spirit, 
the 
spirit 
in 
whom 
truth 
comes 
to 
judgment 
over 
the 
counterfeiting 
of 
four 
millennia, 
should 
be 
counted 
one 
with 
the 
German 
spirit. 


The 
“German 
spirit” 
is 
for 
me 
bad 
air: 
I 
breathe 
with 
difficulty 
near 
the 
by 
now 
instinctive 
uncleanliness 
in 
psychologicis 
which 
every 
word, 
every 
facial 
expression 
of 
a 
German 
betrays. 
They 
have 
never 
gone 
through 
a 
seventeenth 
century 
of 
hard 
self-examination, 
like 
the 
French—a 
La 
Rochefoucauld 
and 
a 
Descartes 
are 
a 
hundred 
times 
superior 
in 
honesty 
to 
the 
foremost 
Germans— 
to 
this 
day 
they 
have 
not 
had 
a 
psychologist. 
But 
psychology 
is 
almost 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
cleanliness 
or 
uncleanliness 
of 
a 
race. 


And 
if 
one 
is 
not 
even 
cleanly, 
how 
should 
one 
have 
depth? 
It 
is 
with 
Germans 
almost 
as 
it 
is 
with 
women: 
one 
never 
fathoms 
their 
depths; 
they 
don’t 
have 
any, 
that 
is 
all. 
They 
aren’t 
even 
shallow.2— 
What 
is 
called 
“deep” 
in 
Germany 
is 
precisely 
this 
instinctive 
uncleanliness 
in 
relation 
to 
oneself 
of 
which 
I 
have 
just 
spoken: 
one 
does 
not 
want 
to 
gain 
clarity 
about 
oneself. 
Might 
I 
not 
propose 
the 
word 
“German” 
as 
an 
international 
coinage 
for 
this 
psychological 
depravity?— 
At 
this 
very 
moment, 
for 
example, 
the 
German 
Kaiser 
calls 
it 
his 
“Christian 
duty” 
to 
liberate 
the 
slaves 
in 
Africa: 
among 
us 
other 
Europeans 
this 
would 
then 
simply 
be 
called 
“German.” 


Have 
the 
Germans 
produced 
even 
one 
book 
that 
has 
depth? 
They 
even 
lack 



the 
idea 
of 
depth 
in 
a 
book. 
I 
have 
met 
scholars 
who 
considered 
Kant 
deep; 
at 
the 
Prussian 
court, 
I 
fear, 
Herr 
von 
Treitschke 
is 
considered 
deep. 
And 
when 
I 
occasionally 
praise 
Stendhal 
as 
a 
deep 
psychologist, 
I 
have 
encountered 
professors 
at 
German 
universities 
who 
asked 
me 
to 
spell 
his 
name. 



4 


And 
why 
should 
I 
not 
go 
all 
the 
way? 
I 
like 
to 
make 
a 
clean 
sweep 
of 
things. 
It 
is 
part 
of 
my 
ambition 
to 
be 
considered 
a 
despiser 
of 
the 
Germans 
par 
excellence. 
My 
mistrust 
of 
the 
German 
character 
I 
expressed 
even 
when 
I 
was 
twenty-six 
(in 
the 
third 
Untimely 
One, 
section 
6)1—the 
Germans 
seem 
impossible 
to 
me. 
When 
I 
imagine 
a 
type 
of 
man 
that 
antagonizes 
all 
my 
instincts, 
it 
always 
turns 
into 
a 
German.2 


The 
first 
point 
on 
which 
I 
“try 
the 
reins” 
is 
to 
see 
whether 
a 
man 
has 
a 
feeling 
for 
distance 
in 
his 
system, 
whether 
he 
sees 
rank, 
degree,3 
order 
between 
man 
and 
man 
everywhere, 
whether 
he 
makes 
distinctions: 
with 
that 
one 
is 
a 
gentilhomme; 
otherwise 
one 
belongs 
hopelessly 
in 
the 
broad-minded 
—ah, 
so 
good-natured—concept 
of 
canaille. 
But 
the 
Germans 
are 
canaille— 
ah, 
they 
are 
so 
good-natured.— 
One 
lowers 
oneself 
when 
one 
associates 
with 
Germans: 
the 
German 
puts 
others 
on 
a 
par.— 
Except 
for 
my 
association 
with 
a 
few 
artists, 
above 
all 
with 
Richard 
Wagner, 
I 
have 
not 
spent 
one 
good 
hour 
with 
a 
German.4— 


If 
the 
most 
profound 
spirit 
of 
all 
millennia 
appeared 
among 
Germans, 
some 
savioress 
of 
the 
capitol5 
would 
suppose 
that 
her 
very 
unbeautiful 
soul 
deserved 
at 
least 
equal 
consideration.— 
I 
cannot 
endure 
this 
race 
among 
whom 
one 
is 
always 
in 
bad 
company, 
that 
has 
no 
fingers 
for 
nuances—alas, 
I 
am 
a 
nuance—that 
has 
no 
esprit 
in 
its 
feet 
and 
does 
not 
even 
know 
how 
to 
walk.— 
The 
Germans 
ultimately 
have 
no 
feet 
at 
all, 
they 
have 
only 
legs.— 
The 
Germans 
have 
no 
idea 
how 
vulgar 
they 
are; 
but 
that 
is 
the 
superlative 
of 
vulgarity—they 
are 
not 
even 
ashamed 
of 
being 
merely 
Germans.— 
They 
join 
in 
every 
discussion; 
they 
consider 
themselves 
decisive; 
I 
fear 
they 
have 
reached 
a 
decision 
even 
about 
me. 


My 
whole 
life 
is 
the 
demonstration 
de 
rigueur6 
of 
these 
propositions. 
In 
vain 
do 
I 
seek 
among 
them 
for 
some 
sign 
of 
tact, 
of 
délicatesse 
in 
relation 
to 
me. 
From 
Jews, 
yes; 
never 
yet 
from 
Germans. 


It 
is 
part 
of 
my 
nature 
to 
be 
gentle 
and 
benevolent 
toward 
everybody—I 
have 
the 
right 
not 
to 
make 
distinctions—but 
that 
does 
not 
prevent 
me 
from 
keeping 
my 
eyes 
open. 
I 
except 
no 
one, 
least 
of 
all 
my 
friends; 
in 
the 
end 
I 



hope 
that 
this 
has 
not 
diminished 
my 
humanity 
in 
relation 
to 
them. 
There 
are 
five 
or 
six 
things 
that 
have 
always 
been 
a 
point 
of 
honor 
with 
me.— 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
true 
that 
almost 
every 
letter 
that 
has 
reached 
me 
for 
years 
now 
strikes 
me 
as 
a 
piece 
of 
cynicism: 
there 
is 
more 
cynicism 
in 
being 
kind 
to 
me 
than 
in 
any 
hatred. 


I 
tell 
every 
one 
of 
my 
friends 
to 
his 
face 
that 
he 
has 
never 
considered 
it 
worth 
while 
to 
study 
any 
of 
my 
writings: 
I 
infer 
from 
the 
smallest 
signs 
that 
they 
do 
not 
even 
know 
what 
is 
in 
them. 
As 
for 
my 
Zarathustra: 
who 
among 
my 
friends 
saw 
more 
in 
it 
than 
an 
impermissible 
but 
fortunately 
utterly 
inconsequential 
presumption? 


Ten 
years—and 
nobody 
in 
Germany 
has 
felt 
bound 
in 
conscience 
to 
defend 
my 
name 
against 
the 
absurd 
silence 
under 
which 
it 
lies 
buried: 
it 
was 
a 
foreigner, 
a 
Dane, 
who 
first 
possessed 
sufficient 
refinement 
of 
instinct 
and 
courage 
for 
this, 
who 
felt 
outraged 
by 
my 
alleged 
friends.— 
At 
what 
German 
university 
would 
it 
be 
possible 
today 
to 
have 
lectures 
on 
my 
philosophy, 
such 
as 
were 
given 
last 
spring 
in 
Copenhagen 
by 
Dr. 
Georg 
Brandes 
who 
thus 
proved 
himself 
once 
again 
as 
a 
psychologist? 


I 
myself 
have 
never 
suffered 
from 
all 
this; 
what 
is 
necessary 
does 
not 
hurt 
me; 
amor 
fati7 
is 
my 
inmost 
nature. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
preclude 
my 
love 
of 
irony, 
even 
world-historical 
irony. 
And 
thus 
I 
have 
sent 
into 
the 
world, 
about 
two 
years 
before 
the 
shattering 
lightning 
bolt 
of 
the 
Revaluation 
that 
will 
make 
the 
earth 
convulse—The 
Case 
of 
Wagner: 
let 
the 
Germans 
commit 
one 
more 
immortal 
blunder 
in 
relation 
to 
me 
that 
will 
stand 
in 
all 
eternity. 
There 
is 
barely 
enough 
time 
left 
for 
that.— 
Has 
it 
been 
accomplished?— 
Most 
delightfully, 
my 
dear 
Teutons! 
My 
compliments!8

An

Scheffel 
(1826– 
1886) 
that 
had 
gone 
through 
about 
140 
editions 
by 
1886. 
In 
an 
earlier 
draft 
for 
this 
passage 
Nietzsche 
had 
considered 
pairing 
“Goethe 
and 
Scheffel” 
the 
way

will

gospel

Richard

deutsche 
Literatur

Neunzehnten 
Jahrhunderts 
(German

so

Nietzsche 
here 
uses 
one 
of 
the

(number

from

and 
applies 
it 
to

crossed

Just 
before 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
section: 
“… 
Certainly, 
one 
who 
has 
to 
live 
among 
Germans 
suffers 
badly 
from 
the 
notorious 
grayness 
of

life 
and 
senses, 
their 
crudity, 
their 
dullness 
and 
doltishness, 
their 
clumsiness 
in 
delicate 
relationships, 
and 
even 
more 
their 
envy 
and 
a 
certain 
slyness 
and 
uncleanliness 
in 
their 
character; 
one 
is 
pained 
and 
offended 
by 
their 
deeply 
rooted 
pleasure 
in 
the 
false 
and 
inauthentic 
…” 
Schopenhauer 
as 
Educator 
was 
written 
and 
published 
in 
1874, 
the 
year 
Nietzsche 
turned 
thirty. 
And 
he 
was 
twenty-seven 
when 
his 
first 
book 
appeared. 
Thus 
“twenty-six” 
in 
the 
text 
is 
an 
error; 
but 
it 
is 
noteworthy 
how 
early 
he 
attributed 
“uncleanliness” 
to 
the 
Germans.

There 
is 
no 
period

were 
struck 
out, 
presumably 
not

Nietzsche.

According

(p.

the 
following 
passage 
(ibid., 
p.

is 
crossed 
out 
in 
the 
MS 
with 
a 
colored 
pencil, 
meaning 
that 
it 
was 
deleted 
by 
the 
printer: 
“Just 
now, 
lest 
my 
friends 
be 
left 
out, 
an 
old 
friend 
writes 
me 
that 
she 
is 
now 
laughing 
at 
me.— 
And 
that 
at 
a 
moment 
when 
an 
indescribable 
responsibility 
weighs 
on 
me—when 
no 
word 
can 
be 
delicate 
and 
no 
eye 
respectful 
enough 
towards 
me. 
For 
I 
bear 
the 
destiny 
of 
humanity 
on 
my 
shoulders.” 
Raoul 
Richter 
included 
this 
passage 
in 
a 
footnote 
to 
his 
postscript 
to 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
Ecce 
Homo 
(1908) 
but 
said 
he 
considered 
it 
“probable 
that 
the 
deletion 
was 
Nietzsche’s 
own” 
(p. 
147).

Chapter

section 
10,

The 
reference 
to 
the 
Revaluation, 
in 
the 
text, 
should 
be 
compared 
with 
section 
3 
of 
“Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols,” 
above: 
Nietzsche 
is 
speaking 
of 
his 
forthcoming 
book. 
He 
is 
not 
implying 
that 
the 
earth 
will 
be 
convulsed 
by 
his 
revelation 
of 
new 
values; 
as 
he 
explains 
in 
the 
first 
section 
of 
“Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil,” 
above, 
the 
revaluation 
is 
a 
“No-saying”—a 
critique 
of 
faith 
and 
morals. 
This 
point 
is 
developed 
further 
on 
the 
following 
pages. 



Why 
I 
Am 
a 
Destiny 



1 


I 
know 
my 
fate. 
One 
day 
my 
name 
will 
be 
associated 
with 
the 
memory 
of 
something 
tremendous—a 
crisis 
without 
equal 
on 
earth, 
the 
most 
profound 
collision 
of 
conscience, 
a 
decision 
that 
was 
conjured 
up 
against 
everything 
that 
had 
been 
believed, 
demanded, 
hallowed 
so 
far. 
I 
am 
no 
man, 
I 
am 
dynamite.1— 
Yet 
for 
all 
that, 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
me 
of 
a 
founder 
of 
a 
religion 
—religions 
are 
affairs 
of 
the 
rabble; 
I 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
wash 
my 
hands 
after 
I 
have 
come 
into 
contact 
with 
religious 
people.— 
I 
want 
no 
“believers”; 
I 
think 
I 
am 
too 
malicious 
to 
believe 
in 
myself; 
I 
never 
speak 
to 
masses.— 
I 
have 
a 
terrible 
fear 
that 
one 
day 
I 
will 
be 
pronounced 
holy: 
you 
will 
guess 
why 
I 
publish 
this 
book 
before; 
it 
shall 
prevent 
people 
from 
doing 
mischief 
with 
me.2 


I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
be 
a 
holy 
man; 
sooner 
even 
a 
buffoon.— 
Perhaps 
I 
am 
a 
buffoon.— 
Yet 
in 
spite 
of 
that—or 
rather 
not 
in 
spite 
of 
it, 
because 
so 
far 
nobody 
has 
been 
more 
mendacious 
than 
holy 
men—the 
truth 
speaks 
out 
of 
me.— 
But 
my 
truth 
is 
terrible; 
for 
so 
far 
one 
has 
called 
lies 
truth. 


Revaluation 
of 
all 
values: 
that 
is 
my 
formula 
for 
an 
act 
of 
supreme 
self-
examination 
on 
the 
part 
of 
humanity, 
become 
flesh 
and 
genius 
in 
me. 
It 
is 
my 
fate 
that 
I 
have 
to 
be 
the 
first 
decent 
human 
being; 
that 
I 
know 
myself 
to 
stand 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
mendaciousness 
of 
millennia.— 
I 
was 
the 
first 
to 
discover 
the 
truth 
by 
being 
the 
first 
to 
experience 
lies 
as 
lies—smelling 
them 
out.— 
My 
genius 
is 
in 
my 
nostrils. 


I 
contradict 
as 
has 
never 
been 
contradicted 
before 
and 
am 
nevertheless 
the 
opposite 
of 
a 
No-saying 
spirit. 
I 
am 
a 
bringer 
of 
glad 
tidings 
like 
no 
one 
before 
me; 
I 
know 
tasks 
of 
such 
elevation 
that 
any 
notion 
of 
them 
has 
been 
lacking 
so 
far; 
only 
beginning 
with 
me 
are 
there 
hopes 
again. 
For 
all 
that, 
I 
am 
necessarily 
also 
the 
man 
of 
calamity. 
For 
when 
truth 
enters 
into 
a 
fight 
with 
the 
lies 
of 
millennia, 
we 
shall 
have 
upheavals, 
a 
convulsion 
of 
earthquakes, 
a 
moving 
of 
mountains 
and 
valleys, 
the 
like 
of 
which 
has 
never 
been 
dreamed 
of. 
The 
concept 
of 
politics 
will 
have 
merged 
entirely 
with 
a 
war 
of 
spirits; 
all 
power 
structures 
of 
the 
old 
society 
will 
have 
been 
exploded 
—all 
of 
them 
are 
based 
on 
lies: 
there 
will 
be 
wars 
the 
like 
of 
which 
have 



never 
yet 
been 
seen 
on 
earth. 
It 
is 
only 
beginning 
with 
me 
that 
the 
earth 
knows 
great 
politics. 



2 


You 
want 
a 
formula 
for 
such 
a 
destiny 
become 
man? 
That 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
my 
Zarathustra: 


“And 
whoever 
wants 
to 
be1 
a 
creator 
in 
good 
and 
evil, 
must 
first 
be 
an 
annihilator 
and 
break 
values. 
Thus 
the 
highest 
evil 
belongs 
to 
the 
greatest 
goodness: 
but 
this 
is—being 
creative.” 


I 
am 
by 
far 
the 
most 
terrible 
human 
being 
that 
has 
existed 
so 
far; 
this 
does 
not 
preclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
the 
most 
beneficial. 
I 
know 
the 
pleasure 
in 
destroying 
to 
a 
degree 
that 
accords 
with 
my 
powers 
to 
destroy— 
in 
both 
respects 
I 
obey 
my 
Dionysian 
nature 
which 
does 
not 
know 
how 
to 
separate 
doing 
No 
from 
saying 
Yes. 
I 
am 
the 
first 
immoralist: 
that 
makes 
me 
the 
annihilator 
par 
excellence. 



3 


I 
have 
not 
been 
asked, 
as 
I 
should 
have 
been 
asked, 
what 
the 
name 
of 
Zarathustra 
means 
in 
my 
mouth, 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
first 
immoralist: 
for 
what 
constitutes 
the 
tremendous 
historical 
uniqueness 
of 
that 
Persian 
is 
just 
the 
opposite 
of 
this. 
Zarathustra 
was 
the 
first 
to 
consider 
the 
fight 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
the 
very 
wheel 
in 
the 
machinery 
of 
things: 
the 
transposition 
of 
morality 
into 
the 
metaphysical 
realm, 
as 
a 
force, 
cause, 
and 
end 
in 
itself, 
is 
his 
work. 
But 
this 
question 
itself 
is 
at 
bottom 
its 
own 
answer. 
Zarathustra 
created 
this 
most 
calamitous 
error, 
morality; 
consequently, 
he 
must 
also 
be 
the 
first 
to 
recognize 
it. 
Not 
only 
has 
he 
more 
experience 
in 
this 
matter, 
for 
a 
longer 
time, 
than 
any 
other 
thinker—after 
all, 
the 
whole 
of 
history 
is 
the 
refutation 
by 
experiment 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
so-called 
“moral 
world 
order”—what 
is 
more 
important 
is 
that 
Zarathustra 
is 
more 
truthful 
than 
any 
other 
thinker. 
His 
doctrine, 
and 
his 
alone, 
posits 
truthfulness 
as 
the 
highest 
virtue; 
this 
means 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
cowardice 
of 
the 
“idealist” 
who 
flees 
from 
reality; 
Zarathustra 
has 
more 
intestinal 
fortitude 
than 
all 
other 
thinkers 
taken 
together. 
To 
speak 
the 
truth 
and 
to 
shoot 
well 
with 
arrows, 
that 
is 
Persian 
virtue.2— 
Am 
I 
understood?— 
The 
self-overcoming 
of 
morality, 
out 
of 
truthfulness; 
the 
self-overcoming 
of 
the 
moralist, 
into 
his 
opposite—into 
me 
—that 
is 
what 
the 
name 
of 
Zarathustra 
means 
in 
my 
mouth. 



4 


Fundamentally, 
my 
term 
immoralist 
involves 
two 
negations. 
For 
one, 
I 
negate 
a 
type 
of 
man 
that 
has 
so 
far 
been 
considered 
supreme: 
the 
good, 
the 
benevolent, 
the 
beneficent. 
And 
then 
I 
negate 
a 
type 
of 
morality 
that 
has 
become 
prevalent 
and 
predominant 
as 
morality 
itself—the 
morality 
of 
decadence 
or, 
more 
concretely, 
Christian 
morality. 
It 
would 
be 
permissible 
to 
consider 
the 
second 
contradiction 
the 
more 
decisive 
one, 
since 
I 
take 
the 
overestimation 
of 
goodness 
and 
benevolence 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
for 
a 
consequence 
of 
decadence, 
for 
a 
symptom 
of 
weakness, 
irreconcilable 
with 
an 
ascending, 
Yes-saying 
life: 
negating 
and 
destroying 
are 
conditions 
of 
saying 
Yes.1 


Let 
me 
tarry 
over 
the 
psychology 
of 
the 
good 
human 
being. 
To 
estimate 
what 
a 
type 
of 
man 
is 
worth, 
one 
must 
calculate 
the 
price 
paid 
for 
his 
preservation—one 
must 
know 
the 
conditions 
of 
his 
existence. 
The 
condition 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
good 
is 
the 
lie: 
put 
differently, 
not 
wanting 
to 
see 
at 
any 
price 
how 
reality 
is 
constituted 
fundamentally—namely, 
not 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
elicit 
benevolent 
instincts 
at 
all 
times, 
and 
even 
less 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
tolerate 
at 
all 
times 
the 
interference 
of 
those 
who 
are 
myopically 
good-
natured. 
To 
consider 
distress 
of 
all 
kinds 
as 
an 
objection, 
as 
something 
that 
must 
be 
abolished, 
is 
the 
niaiserie2 
par 
excellence 
and, 
on 
a 
large 
scale, 
a 
veritable 
disaster 
in 
its 
consequences, 
a 
nemesis3 
of 
stupidity—almost 
as 
stupid 
as 
would 
be 
the 
desire 
to 
abolish 
bad 
weather—say, 
from 
pity 
for 
poor 
people. 


In 
the 
great 
economy 
of 
the 
whole, 
the 
terrible 
aspects 
of 
reality 
(in 
affects, 
in 
desires, 
in 
the 
will 
to 
power) 
are 
to 
an 
incalculable 
degree 
more 
necessary 
than 
that 
form 
of 
petty 
happiness 
which 
people 
call 
“goodness”; 
one 
actually 
has 
to 
be 
quite 
lenient 
to 
accord 
the 
latter 
any 
place 
at 
all, 
considering 
that 
it 
presupposes 
an 
instinctive 
mendaciousness. 
I 
shall 
have 
a 
major 
occasion 
to 
demonstrate 
how 
the 
historical 
consequences 
of 
optimism, 
this 
abortion 
of 
the 
homines 
optimi,4 
have 
been 
uncanny 
beyond 
measure. 
Zarathustra, 
who 
was 
the 
first 
to 
grasp 
that 
the 
optimist 
is 
just 
as 
decadent 
as 
the 
pessimist, 
and 
perhaps 
more 
harmful, 
says: 
“Good 
men 
never 
speak 
the 
truth.”5 



“False 
coasts 
and 
assurances 
the 
good 
have 
taught 
you; 
in 
the 
lies 
of 
the 
good 
you 
were 
hatched 
and 
huddled. 
Everything 
has 
been 
made 
fraudulent 
and 
has 
been 
twisted 
through 
and 
through 
by 
the 
good.”6 


Fortunately, 
the 
world 
has 
not 
been 
designed 
with 
a 
view 
to 
such 
instincts 
that 
only 
good-natured 
herd 
animals 
could 
find 
their 
narrow 
happiness 
in 
it: 
to 
demand 
that 
all 
should 
become 
“good 
human 
beings,” 
herd 
animals, 
blue-
eyed, 
benevolent, 
“beautiful 
souls”—or 
as 
Mr. 
Herbert 
Spencer7 
would 
have 
it, 
altruistic—would 
deprive 
existence 
of 
its 
great 
character 
and 
would 
castrate 
men 
and 
reduce 
them 
to 
the 
level 
of 
desiccated 
Chinese 
stagnation. 


— 
And 
this 
has 
been 
attempted!— 
Precisely 
this 
has 
been 
called 
morality. 
In 
this 
sense, 
Zarathustra 
calls 
the 
good, 
now 
“the 
last 
men,”8 
now 
the 
“beginning 
of 
the 
end”; 
above 
all, 
he 
considers 
them 
the 
most 
harmful 
type 
of 
man 
because 
they 
prevail 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
truth 
and 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 


9

future. 


“The 
good 
are 
unable 
to 
create; 
they 
are 
always 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
end; 
they 
crucify 
him 
who 
writes 
new 
values 
on 
new 
tablets; 
they 
sacrifice 
the 
future 
to 
themselves—they 
sacrifice 
all 
man’s 
future. 


“The 
good 
have 
always 
been 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
end.” 


“And 
whatever 
harm 
those 
do 
who 
slander 
the 
world, 
the 
harm 
done 
by 
the 
good 
is 
the 
most 
harmful 
harm.”10

Zarathustra, 
the 
first 
psychologist 
of 
the 
good, 
is—consequently—a 
friend 
of 
the 
evil. 
When 
a 
decadent 
type 
of 
man 
ascended 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
the 
highest 
type, 
this 
could 
only 
happen 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
its 
countertype, 
the 
type 
of 
man 
that 
is 
strong 
and 
sure 
of 
life. 
When 
the 
herd 
animal 
is 
irradiated 
by 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
purest 
virtue, 
the 
exceptional 
man 
must 
have 
been 
devaluated 
into 
evil. 
When 
mendaciousness 
at 
any 
price 
monopolizes 
the 
word 
“truth” 
for 
its 
perspective, 
the 
really 
truthful 
man 
is 
bound 
to 
be 
branded 
with 
the 
worst 
names. 
Zarathustra 
leaves 
no 
doubt 
at 
this 
point: 
he 
says 
that 
it 
was 
his 
insight 
precisely 
into 
the 
good, 
the 
“best,” 
that 
made 
him 
shudder 
at 
man 
in 
general; 
that 
it 
was 
from 
this 
aversion 
that 
he 
grew 
wings 
“to 
soar 
off 
into 
distant 
futures”; 
he 
does 
not 
conceal 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
type 
of 
man, 
a 
relatively 
superhuman 
type, 
is 
superhuman 
precisely 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
good—that 
the 
good 
and 
the 
just 
would 
call 
his 
overman 
devil. 


“You 
highest 
men 
whom 
my 
eyes 
have 
seen, 
this 
is 
my 
doubt 
about 
you 
and 
my 
secret 
laughter: 
I 
guess 
that 
you 
would 
call 
my 
overman—devil.” 


“What 
is 
great 
is 
so 
alien 
to 
your 
souls 
that 
the 
overman 
would 
be 
terrifying 
to 
you 
in 
his 
goodness.”1 


It 
is 
here 
and 
nowhere 
else 
that 
one 
must 
make 
a 
start 
to 
comprehend 
what 
Zarathustra 
wants: 
this 
type 
of 
man 
that 
he 
conceives, 
conceives 
reality 
as 
it 
is, 
being 
strong 
enough 
to 
do 
so; 
this 
type 
is 
not 
estranged 
or 
removed 
from 
reality 
but 
is 
reality 
itself 
and 
exemplifies 
all 
that 
is 
terrible 
and 
questionable 
in 
it—only 
in 
that 
way 
can 
man 
attain 
greatness.

There 
is 
yet 
another 
sense, 
however, 
in 
which 
I 
have 
chosen 
the 
word 
immoralist 
as 
a 
symbol 
and 
badge 
of 
honor 
for 
myself; 
I 
am 
proud 
of 
having 
this 
word 
which 
distinguishes 
me 
from 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity. 
Nobody 
yet 
has 
felt 
Christian 
morality 
to 
be 
beneath 
him: 
that 
requires 
a 
height, 
a 
view 
of 
distances, 
a 
hitherto 
altogether 
unheard-of 
psychological 
depth 
and 
profundity. 
Christian 
morality 
has 
been 
the 
Circe 
of 
all 
thinkers 
so 
far—they 
stood 
in 
her 
service.— 
Who 
before 
me 
climbed 
into 
the 
caverns 
from 
which 
the 
poisonous 
fumes 
of 
this 
type 
of 
ideal—slander 
of 
the 
world—are 
rising? 
Who 
even 
dared 
to 
suspect 
that 
they 
are 
caverns? 
Who 
among 
philosophers 
was 
a 
psychologist 
at 
all 
before 
me, 
and 
not 
rather 
the 
opposite, 
a 
“higher 
swindler” 
and 
“idealist”? 
There 
was 
no 
psychology 
at 
all 
before 
me.— 
To 
be 
the 
first 
here 
may 
be 
a 
curse; 
it 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
a 
destiny: 
for 
one 
is 
also 
the 
first 
to 
despise.— 
Nausea 
at 
man 
is 
my 
danger. 



7 


Have 
I 
been 
understood?— 
What 
defines 
me, 
what 
sets 
me 
apart 
from 
the 
whole 
rest 
of 
humanity 
is 
that 
I 
uncovered 
Christian 
morality. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
needed 
a 
word 
that 
had 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
provocation 
for 
everybody. 
That 
they 
did 
not 
open 
their 
eyes 
earlier 
at 
this 
point, 
I 
regard 
as 
the 
greatest 
uncleanliness 
that 
humanity 
has 
on 
its 
conscience; 
as 
self-deception 
become 
instinctive; 
as 
a 
fundamental 
will 
not 
to 
see 
any 
event, 
any 
causality, 
any 
reality; 
as 
counterfeiting 
in 
psychologicis 
to 
the 
point 
of 
criminality. 
Blindness 
to 
Christianity 
is 
the 
crime 
par 
excellence—the 
crime 
against 
life. 


The 
millennia, 
the 
nations, 
the 
first 
and 
the 
last, 
the 
philosophers 
and 
old 
women—excepting 
five, 
six 
moments 
in 
history, 
and 
me 
as 
the 
seventh—at 
this 
point 
all 
of 
them 
are 
worthy 
of 
each 
other. 
The 
Christian 
has 
so 
far 
been 
the 
“moral 
being”—a 
matchless 
curiosity—and 
as 
the 
“moral 
being” 
he 
was 
more 
absurd, 
mendacious, 
vain, 
frivolous, 
and 
more 
disadvantageous 
for 
himself 
than 
even 
the 
greatest 
despiser 
of 
humanity 
could 
imagine 
in 
his 
dreams. 
Christian 
morality—the 
most 
malignant 
form 
of 
the 
will 
to 
lie, 
the 
real 
Circe 
of 
humanity—that 
which 
corrupted 
humanity. 
It 
is 
not 
error 
as 
error 
that 
horrifies 
me 
at 
this 
sight—not 
the 
lack, 
for 
thousands 
of 
years, 
of 
“good 
will,” 
discipline, 
decency, 
courage 
in 
matters 
of 
the 
spirit, 
revealed 
by 
its 
victory: 
it 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
nature, 
it 
is 
the 
utterly 
gruesome 
fact 
that 
antinature 
itself 
received 
the 
highest 
honors 
as 
morality 
and 
was 
fixed 
over 
humanity 
as 
law 
and 
categorical 
imperative.— 
To 
blunder 
to 
such 
an 
extent, 
not 
as 
individuals, 
not 
as 
a 
people, 
but 
as 
humanity!— 
That 
one 
taught 
men 
to 
despise 
the 
very 
first 
instincts 
of 
life; 
that 
one 
mendaciously 
invented 
a 
“soul,” 
a 
“spirit” 
to 
ruin 
the 
body; 
that 
one 
taught 
men 
to 
experience 
the 
presupposition 
of 
life, 
sexuality, 
as 
something 
unclean; 
that 
one 
looks 
for 
the 
evil 
principle 
in 
what 
is 
most 
profoundly 
necessary 
for 
growth, 
in 
severe 
selflove2; 
that, 
conversely, 
one 
regards 
the 
typical 
signs 
of 
decline 
and 
contradiction 
of 
the 
instincts, 
the 
“selfless,” 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
center 
of 
gravity, 
“depersonalization” 
and 
“neighbor 
love” 
(addiction 
to 
the 
neighbor) 
as 
the 
higher 
value—what 
am 
I 
saying?—the 
absolute 
value! 


What? 
Is 
humanity 
itself 
decadent? 
Was 
it 
always?— 
What 
is 
certain 
is 



that 
it 
has 
been 
taught 
only 
decadence 
values 
as 
supreme 
values. 
The 
morality 
that 
would 
un-self 
man 
is 
the 
morality 
of 
decline 
par 
excellence— 
the 
fact, 
“I 
am 
declining,” 
transposed 
into 
the 
imperative, 
“all 
of 
you 
ought 
to 
decline”—and 
not 
only 
into 
the 
imperative.— 
This 
only 
morality 
that 
has 
been 
taught 
so 
far, 
that 
of 
un-selfing, 
reveals 
a 
will 
to 
the 
end; 
fundamentally, 
it 
negates 
life. 


This 
would 
still 
leave 
open 
the 
possibility 
that 
not 
humanity 
is 
degenerating 
but 
only 
that 
parasitical 
type 
of 
man—that 
of 
the 
priest—which 
has 
used 
morality 
to 
raise 
itself 
mendaciously 
to 
the 
position 
of 
determining 
human 
values—finding 
in 
Christian 
morality 
the 
means 
to 
come 
to 
power.— 
Indeed, 
this 
is 
my 
insight: 
the 
teachers, 
the 
leaders 
of 
humanity, 
theologians 
all 
of 
them, 
were 
also, 
all 
of 
them, 
decadents: 
hence 
the 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
into 
hostility 
to 
life,2 
hence 
morality— 


Definition 
of 
morality: 
Morality—the 
idiosyncrasy 
of 
decadents, 
with 
the 
ulterior 
motive 
of 
revenging 
oneself 
against 
life—successfully. 
I 
attach 
value 
to 
this 
definition. 



8 


Have 
I 
been 
understood?— 
I 
have 
not 
said 
one 
word 
here 
that 
I 
did 
not 
say 
five 
years 
ago 
through 
the 
mouth 
of 
Zarathustra. 


The 
uncovering 
of 
Christian 
morality 
is 
an 
event 
without 
parallel, 
a 
real 
catastrophe. 
He 
that 
is 
enlightened 
about 
that, 
is 
a 
force 
majeure, 
a 
destiny— 
he 
breaks 
the 
history 
of 
mankind 
in 
two. 
One 
lives 
before 
him, 
or 
one 
lives 
after 
him. 


The 
lightning 
bolt 
of 
truth 
struck 
precisely 
what 
was 
highest 
so 
far: 
let 
whoever 
comprehends 
what 
has 
here 
been 
destroyed 
see 
whether 
anything 
is 
left 
in 
his 
hands. 
Everything 
that 
has 
hitherto 
been 
called 
“truth” 
has 
been 
recognized 
as 
the 
most 
harmful, 
insidious, 
and 
subterranean 
form 
of 
lie; 
the 
holy 
pretext 
of 
“improving” 
mankind, 
as 
the 
ruse 
for 
sucking 
the 
blood 
of 
life 
itself. 
Morality 
as 
vampirism. 


Whoever 
uncovers 
morality 
also 
uncovers 
the 
disvalue 
of 
all 
values 
that 
are 
and 
have 
been 
believed; 
he 
no 
longer 
sees 
anything 
venerable 
in 
the 
most 
venerated 
types 
of 
man, 
even 
in 
those 
pronounced 
holy; 
he 
considers 
them 
the 
most 
calamitous 
type 
of 
abortion—calamitous 
because 
they 
exerted 
such 
fascination. 


The 
concept 
of 
“God” 
invented 
as 
a 
counterconcept 
of 
life—everything 
harmful, 
poisonous, 
slanderous, 
the 
whole 
hostility 
unto 
death 
against 
life 
synthesized 
in 
this 
concept 
in 
a 
gruesome 
unity! 
The 
concept 
of 
the 
“beyond,” 
the 
“true 
world” 
invented 
in 
order 
to 
devaluate 
the 
only 
world 
there 
is1—in 
order 
to 
retain 
no 
goal, 
no 
reason, 
no 
task 
for 
our 
earthly 
reality! 
The 
concept 
of 
the 
“soul,” 
the 
“spirit,” 
finally 
even 
“immortal 
soul,” 
invented 
in 
order 
to 
despise 
the 
body,2 
to 
make 
it 
sick, 
“holy”; 
to 
oppose 
with 
a 
ghastly 
levity 
everything 
that 
deserves 
to 
be 
taken 
seriously 
in 
life, 
the 
questions 
of 
nourishment, 
abode, 
spiritual 
diet, 
treatment 
of 
the 
sick, 
cleanliness, 
and 
weather.3 


In 
place 
of 
health, 
the 
“salvation 
of 
the 
soul”—that 
is, 
a 
folie 
circulaire4 
between 
penitential 
convulsions 
and 
hysteria 
about 
redemption. 
The 
concept 
of 
“sin” 
invented 
along 
with 
the 
torture 
instrument 
that 
belongs 
with 
it, 
the 
concept 
of 
“free 
will,” 
in 
order 
to 
confuse 
the 
instincts, 
to 
make 
mistrust 
of 



the 
instincts 
second 
nature. 
In 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
“selfless,” 
the 
“self-denier,” 
the 
distinctive 
sign 
of 
decadence, 
feeling 
attracted 
by 
what 
is 
harmful, 
being 
unable 
to 
find 
any 
longer 
what 
profits 
one, 
self-destruction 
is 
turned 
into 
the 
sign 
of 
value 
itself, 
into 
“duty,” 
into 
“holiness,” 
into 
what 
is 
“divine” 
in 
man. 
Finally—this 
is 
what 
is 
most 
terrible 
of 
all—the 
concept 
of 
the 
good 
man 
signifies 
that 
one 
sides 
with 
all 
that 
is 
weak, 
sick, 
failure, 
suffering 
of 
itself— 
all 
that 
ought 
to 
perish: 
the 
principle 
of 
selection 
is 
crossed5—an 
ideal 
is 
fabricated 
from 
the 
contradiction 
against 
the 
proud 
and 
well-turned-out 
human 
being 
who 
says 
Yes, 
who 
is 
sure 
of 
the 
future, 
who 
guarantees 
the 
future—and 
he 
is 
now 
called 
evil.— 
And 
all 
this 
was 
believed, 
as 
morality!—

J. 
V. 
Widmann’s 
review 
of 
Beyond 
Good 
and 
Evil, 
September 
16–17, 
1886.

at

von

September 
24,

not 
published

funeral 
in 
1900 
Peter 
Gast 
proclaimed: 
“Holy 
be 
thy 
name 
to 
all 
coming 
generations.” 
Even 
after 
it 
was 
published, 
Ecce

failed 
to 
prevent 
far 
worse 
mischief.

In 
Zarathustra 
II, 
“On 
Self-Overcoming,” 
the 
text 
reads 
“must 
be”; 
and 
“evil” 
is 
followed 
by 
“verily.”

Cf. 
Zarathustra 
I, 
“On 
the 
Thousand 
and 
One 
Goals”: 
“… 
‘To 
speak 
the 
truth 
and 
to 
handle 
bow 
and 
arrow 
well’—that 
seemed 
both 
dear 
and 
difficult 
to 
the 
people 
who 
gave 
me 
my 
name 
…”

Although 
Nietzsche 
associates 
this 
with 
Dionysus, 
cf. 
also 
Jer. 


1:10: 
“See, 
I 
have 
this 
day 
set 
thee 
over 
the 
nations 
and 
over 
the 
kingdoms, 
to 
root 
out, 
and 
to 
pull 
down, 
and 
to 
destroy, 
and 
to 
throw 
down, 
to 
build 
and 
to 
plant.” 
But 
Jeremiah 
felt 
no 
pleasure

destruction.

APPENDIX 



Variants 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
Drafts 



1 


Part 
of 
a 
discarded 
draft 
for 
section 
3 
of 
“Why 
I 
Am 
So 
Clever” 
(Podach, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
pp. 
236f.): 


Emerson 
with 
his 
essays 
has 
been 
a 
good 
friend 
and 
cheered 
me 
up 
even 
in 
black 
periods: 
he 
contains 
so 
much 
skepsis, 
so 
many 
“possibilities” 
that 
even 
virtue 
achieves 
esprit 
in 
his 
writings. 
A 
unique 
case! 
Even 
as 
a 
boy 
I 
enjoyed 
listening 
to 
him. 
Tristram 
Shandy 
also 
belongs 
to 
my 
earliest 
favorites; 
how 
I 
experienced 
Sterne 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
a 
very 
pensive 
passage 
in 
Human, 
All-
Too-Human 
[Part 
II, 
section 
113]. 
Perhaps 
it 
was 
for 
related 
reasons 
that 
I 
preferred 
Lichtenberg1 
among 
German 
books, 
while 
the 
“idealist” 
Schiller 
was 
more 
than 
I 
could 
swallow 
even 
when 
I 
was 
thirteen.— 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
forget 
Abbé 
Galiani,2 
this 
most 
profound 
buffoon 
that 
ever 
lived. 


Of 
all 
books, 
one 
of 
my 
strongest 
impressions 
is 
that 
exuberant 
Provençal, 
Petronius, 
who 
composed 
the 
last 
Satura 
Menippea.3 
Such 
sovereign 
freedom 
from 
“morality,” 
from 
“seriousness,” 
from 
his 
own 
sublime 
taste; 
such 
subtlety 
in 
his 
mixture 
of 
vulgar 
and 
“educated” 
Latin; 
such 
indomitable 
good 
spirits 
that 
leap 
with 
grace 
and 
malice 
over 
all 
anomalies 
of 
the 
ancient 
“soul” 
—I 
could 
not 
name 
any 
book 
that 
makes 
an 
equally 
liberating 
impression 
on 
me: 
the 
effect 
is 
Dionysian. 
In 
cases 
in 
which 
I 
find 
it 
necessary 
to 
recuperate 
quickly 
from 
a 
base 
impression—for 
example, 
because 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
my 
critique 
of 
Christianity 
I 
had 
to 
breathe 
all 
too 
long 
the 
swampy 
air 
of 
the 
apostle 
Paul—a 
few 
pages 
of 
Petronius 
suffice 
me 
as 
a 
heroic 
remedy, 
and 
immediately 
I 
am 
well 
again. 



2 


Part 
of 
a 
discarded 
draft 
for 
section 
3 
of 
“Why 
I 
Write 
Such 
Good 
Books” 
(Podach, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
pp. 
251f.): 


My 
writings 
are 
difficult; 
I 
hope 
this 
is 
not 
considered 
an 
objection? 
To 
understand 
the 
most 
abbreviated 
language 
ever 
spoken 
by 
a 
philosopher— 
and 
also 
the 
one 
poorest 
in 
formulas, 
most 
alive, 
most 
artistic—one 
must 
follow 
the 
opposite 
procedure 
of 
that 
generally 
required 
by 
philosophical 
literature. 
Usually, 
one 
must 
condense, 
or 
upset 
one’s 
digestion; 
I 
have 
to 
be 
diluted, 
liquefied, 
mixed 
with 
water, 
else 
one 
upsets 
one’s 
digestion. 


Silence 
is 
as 
much 
of 
an 
instinct 
with 
me 
as 
is 
garrulity 
with 
our 
dear 
philosophers. 
I 
am 
brief; 
my 
readers 
themselves 
must 
become 
long 
and 
comprehensive 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
up 
and 
together 
all 
that 
I 
have 
thought, 
and 
thought 
deep 
down. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
are 
prerequisites 
for 
“understanding” 
here, 
which 
very 
few 
can 
satisfy: 
one 
must 
be 
able 
to 
see 
a 
problem 
in 
its 
proper 
place— 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
other 
problems 
that 
belong 
with 
it; 
and 
for 
this 
one 
must 
have 
at 
one’s 
finger 
tips 
the 
topography 
of 
various 
nooks 
and 
the 
difficult 
areas 
of 
whole 
sciences 
and 
above 
all 
of 
philosophy. 


Finally, 
I 
speak 
only 
of 
what 
I 
have 
lived 
through, 
not 
merely 
of 
what 
I 
have 
thought 
through; 
the 
opposition 
of 
thinking 
and 
life 
is 
lacking 
in 
my 
case. 
My 
“theory” 
grows 
from 
my 
“practice”—oh, 
from 
a 
practice 
that 
is 
not 
by 
any 
means 
harmless 
or 
unproblematic! 



3 


In 
his 
postscript 
to 
the 
first 
edition, 
1908, 
Raoul 
Richter 
said: 
“A 
page 
that, 
according 
to 
information 
received 
from 
Frau 
Förster-Nietzsche, 
was 
mailed 
to 
Paraguay, 
with 
a 
notation 
regarding 
its 
insertion 
in 
Ecce 
Homo, 
survives 
in 
a 
copy 
and 
contains 
invective 
against 
his 
brother-in-law 
and 
friends, 
but 
has 
been 
excluded 
from 
publication 
here 
as 
something 
not 
belonging 
to 
the 
authentic 
Nietzsche. 
This 
is 
presumably 
one 
of 
those 
violent 
outpourings 
of 
which 
several 
have 
been 
found 
in 
the 
Förster 
papers, 
some 
of 
them 
long 
destroyed, 
with 
uninhibited 
attacks 
on 
Bismarck, 
the 
Kaiser, 
and 
others. 
The 
fact 
alone 
that 
an 
addition 
to 
Ecce 
Homo 
was 
sent 
to 
South 
America 
[where 
the 
sister 
and 
brother-in-law 
were 
then 
living], 
instead 
of 
being 
sent 
to 
the 
publisher 
in 
Leipzig, 
shows 
that 
this 
is 
presumably 
a 
page 
that 
belongs 
to 
the 
first 
days 
of 
the 
collapse. 
Possibly, 
a 
similar 
but 
no 
longer 
extant 
note 
sent 
to 
the 
publisher 
was 
also 
intended 
for 
Ecce.” 
Podach’s 
criticism 
of 
Richter 
for 
not 
publishing 
this 
note 
(Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
pp. 
198f.) 
seems 
highly 
unreasonable; 
but 
the 
text 
(this 
page) 
deserves 
inclusion 
in 
this 
Appendix. 
Nietzsche’s 
notation 
read: 
“To 
be 
inserted 
in 
the 
chapter 
‘The 
Case 
of 
Wagner,’ 
section 
4, 
after 
the 
words: 
‘Except 
for 
my 
association 
with 
a 
few 
artists, 
above 
all 
with 
Richard 
Wagner, 
I 
have 
not 
spent 
one 
good 
hour 
with 
a 
German’ 
” 
(ibid., 
this 
page). 
The 
text 
itself 
reads: 


Shall 
I 
here 
divulge 
my 
“German” 
experiences?—Förster: 
long 
legs, 
blue 
eyes, 
blond 
(straw 
head!), 
a 
“racial 
German” 
who 
with 
poison 
and 
gall 
attacks 
everything 
that 
guarantees 
spirit 
and 
future: 
Judaism, 
vivisection, 
etc. 
—but 
for 
his 
sake 
my 
sister 
left 
those 
nearest 
her1 
and 
plunged 
into 
a 
world 
full 
of 
dangers 
and 
evil 
accidents. 


Köselitz:2 
Saxon, 
weak, 
at 
times 
awkward, 
immovable, 
an 
embodiment 
of 
the 
law 
of 
gravity—but 
his 
music 
is 
of 
the 
first 
rank 
and 
runs 
on 
light 
feet. 


Overbeck3 
dried 
up, 
become 
sour, 
subject 
to 
his 
wife, 
hands 
me, 
like 
Mime,4 
the 
poisoned 
draft 
of 
doubt 
and 
mistrust 
of 
myself—but 
he 
shows 
how 
he 
is 
full 
of 
good 
will 
toward 
me 
and 
worried 
about 
me 
and 
calls 
himself 



my 
“indulgent 
friend.” 


Look 
at 
them—these 
are 
three 
German 
types! 
Canaille! 


And 
if 
the 
most 
profound 
spirit 
of 
all 
millennia 
appeared 
among 
Germans 



4 


All 
of 
the 
paragraphs 
in 
this 
section 
come 
from 
three 
discarded 
drafts 
for 
the 
attack 
on 
the 
Germans 
in 
the 
chapter 
“The 
Case 
of 
Wagner.” 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
constitute 
the 
beginning 
and 
end 
of 
the 
same 
draft 
(Podach, 
Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
this 
page); 
(c) 
comes 
from 
another 
attempt 
(ibid., 
this 
page); 
(d) 
from 
the 
last 
(ibid., 
pp. 
318f.). 



(a) 


And 
from 
what 
side 
did 
all 
great 
obstructions, 
all 
calamities 
in 
my 
life 
emanate? 
Always 
from 
Germans. 
The 
damnable 
German 
anti-Semitism, 
this 
poisonous 
boil 
of 
névrose 
nationale, 
has 
intruded 
into 
my 
existence 
almost 
ruinously 
during 
that 
decisive 
time 
when 
not 
my 
destiny 
but 
the 
destiny 
of 
humanity 
was 
at 
issue. 
And 
I 
owe 
it 
to 
the 
same 
element 
that 
my 
Zarathustra 
entered 
this 
world 
as 
indecent 
literature—its 
publisher 
being 
an 
anti-Semite. 
In 
vain 
do 
I 
look 
for 
some 
sign 
of 
tact, 
of 
délicatesse, 
in 
relation 
to 
me: 
from 
Jews, 
yes; 
never 
yet 
from 
Germans. 



(b) 


The 
Germans 
are 
by 
far 
the 
worst 
experience 
of 
my 
life; 
for 
sixteen 
years 
now 
one 
has 
left 
me 
in 
the 
lurch, 
not 
only 
concerning 
my 
philosophy 
but 
also 
in 
regard 
to 
my 
honor. 
What 
respect 
can 
I 
have 
for 
the 
Germans 
when 
even 
my 
friends 
cannot 
discriminate 
between 
me 
and 
a 
liar 
like 
Richard 
Wagner? 
In 
one 
extreme 
case, 
one 
even 
straddles 
the 
fence 
between 
me 
and 
anti-
Semitic 
canaille. 
— 
And 
this 
at 
a 
moment 
when 
an 
indescribable 
responsibility 
weighs 
on 
me—1 



(c) 


It 
seems 
to 
be 
that 
association 
with 
Germans 
even 
corrupts 
one’s 
character. 
I 
lose 
all 
mistrust; 
I 
feel 
how 
the 
fungus 
of 
neighbor-love 
spreads 
in 
me—it 
has 
even 
happened, 
to 
my 
profound 
humiliation, 
that 
I 
have 
become 
good-
natured. 
Is 
it 
possible 
to 
sink 
any 
lower?— 
For 
with 
me, 
malice 
belongs 
to 
happiness—I 
am 
no 
good 
when 
I 
am 
not 
malicious2—I 
find 
no 
small 
justification 
of 
existence 
in 
provoking 
tremendous 
stupidities 
against 
me. 



(d) 


I 
am 
solitude 
become 
man.3— 
That 
no 
word 
ever 
reached 
me, 
forced 
me 
to 
reach 
myself.— 
I 
should 
not 
be 
possible 
without 
a 
countertype 
of 
race, 
without 
Germans, 
without 
these 
Germans, 
without 
Bismarck, 
without 
1848, 
without 
“Wars 
of 
Liberation,” 
without 
Kant, 
even 
without 
Luther.— 
The 
great 
crimes 
committed 
against 
culture 
by 
the 
Germans 
are 
justified 
in 
a 
higher 
economy 
of 
culture.— 
I 
want 
nothing 
differently, 
not 
backward 
either 
—I 
was 
not 
permitted 
to 
want 
anything 
differently.— 
Amor 
fati.— 
Even 
Christianity 
becomes 
necessary: 
only 
the 
highest 
form, 
the 
most 
dangerous, 
the 
one 
that 
was 
most 
seductive 
in 
its 
No 
to 
life, 
provokes 
its 
highest 
affirmation—me.— 
What 
in 
the 
end 
are 
these 
two 
millennia? 
Our 
most 
instructive 
experiment, 
a 
vivisection 
of 
life 
itself.— 
Merely 
two 
millennia!— 



5 


For 
a 
time, 
Nietzsche 
thought 
of 
concluding 
Ecce 
Homo 
with 
two 
sections 
that 
are 
included 
in 
a 
table 
of 
contents 
reproduced 
photographically 
by 
Podach 
(Friedrich 
Nietzsches 
Werke, 
plate 
XIV); 
but 
then 
he 
wrote 
on 
a 
separate 
sheet 
(ibid., 
p. 
332): 
“The 
section 
Declaration 
of 
War 
is 
to 
be 
omitted—Also 
The 
Hammer 
Speaks.” 
The 
latter 
he 
moved 
to 
the 
end 
of 
Twilight 
(Portable 
Nietzsche, 
p. 
563); 
the 
former 
is 
lost, 
except 
for 
the 
following 
paragraph 
on 
a 
sheet 
with 
the 
notation: 
“At 
the 
end, 
after 
the 
Declaration 
of 
War” 
(ibid., 
p.332). 



Final 
Consideration 


If 
we 
could 
dispense 
with 
wars, 
so 
much 
the 
better. 
I 
can 
imagine 
more 
profitable 
uses 
for 
the 
twelve 
billion 
now 
paid 
annually 
for 
the 
armed 
peace 
we 
have 
in 
Europe; 
there 
are 
other 
means 
of 
winning 
respect 
for 
physiology 
than 
field 
hospitals.— 
Good; 
very 
good 
even: 
since 
the 
old 
God 
is 
abolished, 
I 
am 
prepared 
to 
rule 
the 
world— 


1 
Georg 
Christoph 
Lichtenberg 
(1742–1799), 
professor 
of 
physics 
at 
Göttingen, 
was 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
German 
aphorist 
and 
satirist 
of 
his 
century.

The 
relevant 
information 
has 
been 
put 
most 
succinctly 
by 
William 
Arrow-smith, 
in 
his 
Introduction 
to 
his 
own 
translation 
of 
The 
Satyricon 
of 
Petronius 
(Ann 
Arbor, 
Mich., 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Press, 
1959), 
p. 


x: 
“Formally 
… 
the 
Satyricon 
… 
belongs 
to 
that 
genre 
we 
call 
Menippean 
satire, 
the 
curious 
blending 
of 
prose 
with 
verse 
and 
philosophy 
with 
realism 
invented 
by 
the 
Cynic 
philosopher 
Menippus 
of 
Gadara 
[third 
century 
B.C.] 
and 
continued 
by 
his 
Roman 
disciple, 
Varro 
[116–27 
B.C.].” 
The 
identity 
and 
dates 
of 
Petronius 
have 
been 
disputed, 
but 
he 
probably 
committed 
suicide 
when 
Nero 
was 
Emperor.

Bibliographical 
Note 


Nietzsche’s 
works 
are 
generally 
cited 
by 
section 
numbers, 
as 
these 
are 
the 
same 
in 
all 
editions. 


Thus 
Spoke 
Zarathustra, 
Twilight 
of 
the 
Idols, 
and 
Nietzsche 
contra 
Wagner 
are 
not 
composed 
of 
consecutively 
numbered 
sections; 
but 
they 
are 
available 
in 
a 
single 
volume, 
along 
with 
The 
Antichrist 
and 
selections 
from 
Nietzsche’s 
other

from 
his

[The] 
word 
nihilism 
came 
into 
vogue 
through 
Turgeniev 
as 
a 
name 
for 
the 
notion 
that 
only 
what 
is 
perceptible 
to 
our 
senses, 
that 
is, 
only 
beings 
that 
one 
experiences 
oneself, 
only 
these 
and 
nothing 
else 
are 
real 
and 
have 
being. 
Therefore, 
anything 
grounded 
on 
tradition, 
authority, 
or 
any 
other 
definitive 
value 
is 
negated. 
Usually, 
however, 
the 
name 
positivism 
is 
used 
to 
designate 
this 
point 
of 
view. 


For 
Nietzsche, 
though, 
the 
word 
nihilism 
means 
something 
substantially 
“more.” 
Nietzsche 
speaks 
about 
“European 
nihilism.” 
He 
does 
not 
mean 
the 
positivism 
that 
arose 
in 
the 
mid-nineteenth 
century 
and 
spread 
throughout 
Europe. 
“European” 
has 
a 
historical 
significance 
here, 
and 
means 
as 
much 
as 
“Western” 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
Western 
history. 
Nietzsche 
uses 
nihilism 
as 
the 
name 
for 
the 
historical 
movement 
that 
he 
was 
the 
first 
to 
recognize 
and 
that 
already 
governed 
the 
previous 
century 
while 
defining 
the 
century 
to 
come, 
the 
movement 
whose 
essential 
interpretation 
he 
concentrates 
in 
the 
terse 
sentence: 
“God 
is 
dead.” 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
“Christian 
God” 
has 
lost 
His 
power 
over 
beings 
and 
over 
the 
determination 
of 
man. 
“Christian 
God” 
also 
stands 
for 
the 
“transcendent” 
in 
general 
in 
its 
various 
meanings—for 
“ideals” 
and 
“norms,” 
“principles” 
and 
“rules,” 
“ends” 
and 
“values,” 
which 
are 
set 
“above” 
the 
being, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
a 
purpose, 
an 
order, 
and 
—as 
it 
is 
succintly 
expressed—“meaning.” 
Nihilism 
is 
that 
historical 
process 
whereby 
the 
dominance 
of 
the 
“transcendent” 
becomes 
null 
and 
void, 
so 
that 
all 
being 
loses 
its 
worth 
and 
meaning. 
Nihilism 
is 
the 
history 
of 
the 
being 
itself, 
through 
which 
the 
death 
of 
the 
Christian 
God 
comes 
slowly 
but 
inexorably 
to 
light. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
this 
God 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
believed 
in, 
and 
that 
His 
world 
will 
be 
taken 
as 
“real,” 
“effectual,” 
and 
“determinative.” 
This 
history 
resembles 
the 
process 
in 
which 
the 
light 
of 
a 
star 
that 
has 
been 
extinguished 
for 
millennia 
still 
gleams, 
but 
in 
its 
gleaming 
nonetheless 
remains 
a 
mere 
“appearance.” 
For 
Nietzsche, 
therefore, 
nihilism 
is 
in 
no 
way 
some 
kind 
of 
viewpoint 
“put 
forward” 
by 
somebody, 
nor 
is 
it 
an 
arbitrary 
historical 
“given,” 
among 
many 
others, 
that 
can 
be 
historically 
documented. 
Nihilism 
is, 
rather, 
that 
event 
of 
long 
duration 
in 
which 
the 
truth 
of 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
essentially 
transformed 
and 
driven 
toward 
an 
end 
that 
such 
truth 
has 



determined. 


The 
truth 
of 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
has 
long 
been 
called 
metaphysics. 
Every 
era, 
every 
human 
epoch, 
is 
sustained 
by 
some 
metaphysics 
and 
is 
placed 
thereby 
in 
a 
definite 
relation 
to 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
also 
to 
itself. 
The 
end 
of 
metaphysics 
discloses 
itself 
as 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
the 
transcendent 
and 
the 
“ideal” 
that 
sprang 
from 
it. 
But 
the 
end 
of 
metaphysics 
does 
not 
mean 
the 
cessation 
of 
history. 
It 
is 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
serious 
concern 
with 
that 
“event”: 
“God 
is 
dead.” 
That 
beginning 
is 
already 
under 
way. 
Nietzsche 
himself 
understood 
his 
philosophy 
as 
an 
introduction 
to 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 
age. 
He 
envisioned 
the 
coming 
century—that 
is, 
the 
current, 
twentieth 
century—as 
the 
start 
of 
an 
era 
whose 
upheavals 
could 
not 
be 
compared 
to 
anything 
previously 
known. 
Although 
the 
scenery 
of 
the 
world 
theater 
might 
remain 
the 
same 
for 
a 
time, 
the 
play 
in 
performance 
would 
already 
be 
a 
different 
one. 
The 
fact 
that 
earlier 
aims 
now 
disappear 
and 
former 
values 
are 
devalued 
is 
no 
longer 
experienced 
as 
sheer 
annihilation 
and 
deplored 
as 
wasteful 
and 
wrong, 
but 
is 
rather 
greeted 
as 
a 
liberation, 
touted 
as 
an 
irrevocable 
gain, 
and 
perceived 
as 
a 
fulfillment. 


“Nihilism” 
is 
the 
increasingly 
dominant 
truth 
that 
all 
prior 
aims 
of 
being 
have 
become 
superfluous. 
But 
with 
this 
transformation 
of 
the 
erstwhile 
relation 
to 
ruling 
values, 
nihilism 
has 
also 
perfected 
itself 
for 
the 
free 
and 
genuine 
task 
of 
a 
new 
valuation. 
Such 
nihilism, 
which 
is 
in 
itself 
perfected 
and 
is 
decisive 
for 
the 
future, 
may 
be 
characterized 
as 
“classical 
nihilism.” 
Nietzsche 
describes 
his 
own 
“metaphysics” 
with 
this 
name 
and 
conceives 
it 
to 
be 
the 
counterstroke 
to 
all 
preceding 
metaphysics. 
The 
name 
nihilism 
thus 
loses 
the 
purely 
nihilistic 
sense 
in 
which 
it 
means 
a 
destruction 
and 
annihilation 
of 
previous 
values, 
the 
mere 
negation 
of 
beings 
and 
the 
futility 
of 
human 
history. 


“Nihilism,” 
thought 
now 
in 
its 
classic 
sense, 
calls 
for 
freedom 
from 
values 
as 
freedom 
for 
a 
revaluation 
of 
all 
(such) 
values. 
Nietzsche 
uses 
the 
expression 
“revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
hitherto” 
alongside 
the 
key 
word 
nihilism 
as 
another 
major 
rubric 
by 
which 
he 
assigns 
his 
own 
fundamental 
metaphysical 
position 
its 
definite 
place 
within 
the 
history 
of 
Western 
metaphysics. 


From 
the 
rubric 
“revaluation 
of 
values,” 
we 
expect 
that 
altered 
values 
will 
be 
posited 
in 
place 
of 
earlier 
ones. 
But 
for 
Nietzsche 
“revaluation” 
means 
that 
the 
very 
“place” 
for 
previous 
values 
disappears, 
not 
merely 
that 
the 
values 
themselves 
fall 
away. 
This 
implies 
that 
the 
nature 
and 
direction 
of 
valuation, 



and 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
value 
are 
transformed. 
The 
revaluation 
thinks 
Being 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
value. 
With 
it, 
metaphysics 
begins 
to 
be 
value 
thinking. 
In 
accordance 
with 
this 
transformation, 
prior 
values 
do 
not 
merely 
succumb 
to 
devaluation 
but, 
above 
all, 
the 
need 
for 
values 
in 
their 
former 
shape 
and 
in 
their 
previous 
place—that 
is 
to 
say, 
their 
place 
in 
the 
transcendent—is 
uprooted. 
The 
uprooting 
of 
past 
needs 
most 
assuredly 
takes 
place 
by 
cultivating 
the 
growing 
ignorance 
of 
past 
values 
and 
by 
obliterating 
history 
through 
a 
revision 
of 
its 
basic 
traits. 
“Revaluation 
of 
prior 
values” 
is 
primarily 
the 
metamorphosis 
of 
all 
valuation 
heretofore 
and 
the 
“breeding” 
of 
a 
new 
need 
for 
values. 


If 
such 
revaluation 
of 
all 
prior 
values 
is 
not 
only 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
but 
is 
also 
to 
be 
grounded, 
then 
it 
has 
need 
of 
a 
“new 
principle”; 
that 
is, 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
basis 
for 
defining 
beings 
as 
a 
whole 
in 
a 
new, 
authoritative 
way. 
But 
if 
the 
interpretation 
of 
beings 
as 
a 
whole 
cannot 
issue 
from 
a 
transcendent 
that 
is 
posited 
“over” 
them 
from 
the 
outset, 
then 
the 
new 
values 
and 
their 
standard 
of 
measure 
can 
only 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
realm 
of 
beings 
themselves. 
Thus 
beings 
themselves 
require 
a 
new 
interpretation 
through 
which 
their 
basic 
character 
may 
be 
defined 
in 
a 
way 
that 
will 
make 
it 
fit 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
“principle” 
for 
the 
inscription 
of 
a 
new 
table 
of 
values 
and 
as 
a 
standard 
of 
measure 
for 
suitably 
ranking 
such 
values. 


If 
the 
essence 
of 
metaphysics 
consists 
in 
grounding 
the 
truth 
of 
being 
as 
a 
whole, 
then 
the 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values, 
as 
a 
grounding 
of 
the 
principle 
for 
a 
new 
valuation, 
is 
itself 
metaphysics. 
What 
Nietzsche 
perceives 
and 
posits 
as 
the 
basic 
character 
of 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
is 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
“will 
to 
power.” 
That 
concept 
does 
not 
merely 
delimit 
what 
a 
being 
in 
its 
Being 
is: 
Nietzsche’s 
phrase, 
“will 
to 
power,” 
which 
has 
in 
many 
ways 
become 
familiar, 
contains 
his 
interpretation 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
power. 
Every 
power 
is 
a 
power 
only 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
more 
power; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
an 
increase 
in 
power. 
Power 
can 
maintain 
itself 
in 
itself, 
that 
is, 
in 
its 
essence, 
only 
if 
it 
overtakes 
and 
overcomes 
the 
power 
level 
it 
has 
already 
attained—overpowering 
is 
the 
expression 
we 
use. 
As 
soon 
as 
power 
stalls 
at 
a 
certain 
power 
level, 
it 
immediately 
becomes 
powerless. 
“Will 
to 
power” 
does 
not 
mean 
simply 
the 
“romantic” 
yearning 
and 
quest 
for 
power 
by 
those 
who 
have 
no 
power; 
rather, 
“will 
to 
power” 
means 
the 
accruing 
of 
power 
by 
power 
for 
its 
own 
overpowering. 


“Will 
to 
power” 
is 
a 
single 
name 
for 
the 
basic 
character 
of 
beings 
and 
for 
the 
essence 
of 
power. 
Nietzsche 
often 
substitutes 
“force” 
for 
“will 
to 
power” 



in 
a 
way 
that 
is 
easily 
misunderstood. 
His 
conception 
of 
the 
basic 
character 
of 
beings 
as 
will 
to 
power 
is 
not 
the 
contrivance 
or 
whim 
of 
a 
fantast 
who 
has 
strayed 
off 
of 
chase 
chimeras. 
It 
is 
the 
fundamental 
experience 
of 
a 
thinker; 
that 
is, 
of 
one 
of 
those 
individuals 
who 
have 
no 
choice 
but 
to 
find 
words 
for 
what 
a 
being 
is 
in 
the 
history 
of 
its 
Being. 
Every 
being, 
insofar 
as 
it 
is, 
and 
is 
as 
it 
is, 
is 
“will 
to 
power.” 
The 
phrase 
names 
that 
from 
which 
all 
valuation 
proceeds 
and 
to 
which 
it 
returns. 
However, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
the 
new 
valuation 
is 
not 
a 
“revaluation 
of 
all 
prior 
values” 
merely 
in 
that 
it 
supplants 
all 
earlier 
values 
with 
power, 
the 
uppermost 
value, 
but 
first 
and 
foremost 
because 
power 
and 
only 
power 
posits 
values, 
validates 
them, 
and 
makes 
decisions 
about 
the 
possible 
justifications 
of 
a 
valuation. 
If 
all 
being 
is 
will 
to 
power, 
then 
only 
what 
is 
fulfilled 
in 
its 
essence 
by 
power 
“has” 
value 
or 
“is” 
a 
value. 
But 
power 
is 
power 
only 
as 
enhancement 
of 
power. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
it 
is 
truly 
power, 
alone 
determining 
all 
beings, 
power 
does 
not 
recognize 
the 
worth 
or 
value 
of 
anything 
outside 
of 
itself. 
That 
is 
why 
will 
to 
power 
as 
a 
principle 
for 
the 
new 
valuation 
tolerates 
no 
end 
outside 
of 
being 
as 
a 
whole. 
Now, 
because 
all 
beings 
as 
will 
to 
power—that 
is, 
as 
incessant 
selfoverpowering—
must 
be 
a 
continual 
“becoming,” 
and 
because 
such 
“becoming” 
cannot 
move 
“toward 
an 
end” 
outside 
its 
own 
“farther 
and 
farther,” 
but 
is 
ceaselessly 
caught 
up 
in 
the 
cyclical 
increase 
of 
power 
to 
which 
it 
reverts, 
then 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
too, 
as 
this 
power-conforming 
becoming, 
must 
itself 
always 
recur 
again 
and 
bring 
back 
the 
same. 


Hence, 
the 
basic 
character 
of 
beings 
as 
will 
to 
power 
is 
also 
defined 
as 
“the 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same.” 
The 
latter 
constitutes 
yet 
another 
major 
rubric 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
metaphysics 
and, 
moreover, 
implies 
something 
essential: 
only 
through 
the 
adequately 
conceived 
essence 
of 
will 
to 
power 
can 
it 
become 
clear 
why 
the 
Being 
of 
beings 
as 
a 
whole 
must 
be 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same. 
The 
reverse 
holds 
as 
well: 
only 
through 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same 
can 
the 
innermost 
core 
of 
will 
to 
power 
and 
its 
necessity 
be 
grasped. 
The 
phrase 
“will 
to 
power” 
tells 
what 
beings 
are 
in 
their 
“essence” 
(in 
their 
constitution). 
The 
phrase 
“eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same” 
tells 
how 
beings 
of 
such 
an 
essence 
must 
as 
a 
whole 
be. 


It 
remains 
for 
us 
to 
observe 
what 
is 
decisive 
here; 
namely, 
that 
Nietzsche 
had 
to 
think 
the 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same 
before 
the 
will 
to 
power. 
The 
most 
essential 
thought 
is 
thought 
first. 


When 
Nietzsche 
himself 
insists 
that 
Being, 
as 
“life,” 
is 
in 
essence 
“becoming” 
he 
does 
not 
intend 
the 
roughly 
defined 
concept 
of 
“becoming” 
to 



mean 
either 
an 
endless, 
continual 
progression 
to 
some 
unknown 
goal, 
nor 
is 
he 
thinking 
about 
the 
confused 
turmoil 
and 
tumult 
of 
unrestrained 
drives. 
The 
vague 
and 
hackneyed 
term 
becoming 
signifies 
the 
overpowering 
of 
power, 
as 
the 
essence 
of 
power, 
which 
powerfully 
and 
continually 
returns 
to 
itself 
in 
its 
own 
way. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same 
offers 
the 
keenest 
interpretation 
of 
“classical 
nihilism,” 
which 
absolutely 
obliterates 
any 
end 
above 
and 
beyond 
beings. 
For 
such 
nihilism, 
the 
words 
“God 
is 
dead” 
suggest 
the 
impotence 
not 
only 
of 
the 
Christian 
God 
but 
of 
every 
transcendent 
element 
under 
which 
men 
might 
want 
to 
shelter 
themselves. 
And 
that 
impotence 
signifies 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
old 
order. 


With 
the 
revaluation 
of 
all 
past 
values, 
an 
unrestricted 
challenge 
has 
been 
issued 
to 
men: 
that 
unconditionally 
from, 
through, 
and 
over 
themselves, 
they 
raise 
“new 
standards” 
under 
which 
the 
accommodation 
of 
being 
as 
a 
whole 
to 
a 
new 
order 
must 
be 
effected. 
Because 
the 
“transcendent,” 
the 
“beyond,” 
and 
“heaven” 
have 
been 
abolished, 
only 
the 
“earth” 
remains. 
The 
new 
order 
must 
therefore 
be 
the 
absolute 
dominance 
of 
pure 
power 
over 
the 
earth 
through 
man—not 
through 
any 
arbitrary 
kind 
of 
man, 
and 
certainly 
not 
through 
the 
humanity 
that 
has 
heretofore 
lived 
under 
the 
old 
values. 
Through 
what 
kind 
of 
man, 
then? 


With 
nihilism—that 
is 
to 
say, 
with 
the 
revaluation 
of 
all 
prior 
values 
among 
beings 
as 
will 
to 
power 
and 
in 
light 
of 
the 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same—it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
posit 
a 
new 
essence 
for 
man. 
But, 
because 
“God 
is 
dead,” 
only 
man 
himself 
can 
grant 
man 
his 
measure 
and 
center, 
the 
“type” 
the 
“model” 
of 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
man 
who 
has 
assigned 
the 
task 
of 
a 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
to 
the 
individual 
power 
of 
his 
will 
to 
power 
and 
who 
is 
prepared 
to 
embark 
on 
the 
absolute 
domination 
of 
the 
globe. 
Classical 
nihilism, 
which 
as 
the 
revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
hitherto 
understands 
beings 
as 
will 
to 
power 
and 
can 
admit 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same 
as 
the 
sole 
“end,” 
must 
take 
man 
himself—that 
is, 
man 
as 
he 
has 
been 
until 
now—out 
of 
and 
“over” 
himself 
and 
must 
fashion 
as 
his 
measure 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
“Overman.” 


From 
Nietzsche’s 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
Overman 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
be 
a 
mere 
amplification 
of 
prior 
man, 
but 
the 
most 
unequivocally 
singular 
form 
of 
human 
existence 
that, 
as 
absolute 
will 
to 
power, 
is 
brought 
to 
power 
in 
every 
man 
to 
some 
degree 
and 
that 
thereby 
grants 
him 
his 
membership 
in 
being 
as 
a 
whole—that 
is, 
in 
will 
to 
power—and 
that 
shows 
him 
to 
be 
a 
true 
“being,” 
close 
to 
reality 
and 
“life.” 
The 
Overman 
simply 
leaves 
the 
man 
of 
traditional 



values 
behind, 
overtakes 
him, 
and 
transfers 
the 
justification 
for 
all 
laws 
and 
the 
positing 
of 
all 
values 
to 
the 
empowering 
of 
power. 
An 
act 
or 
accomplishment 
is 
valid 
as 
such 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
it 
serves 
to 
equip, 
nurture, 
and 
enhance 
will 
to 
power. 


The 
five 
main 
rubrics 
we 
have 
mentioned—“nihilism,” 
“revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
hitherto,” 
“will 
to 
power,” 
“eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same,” 
and 
“Overman”—each 
portrays 
Nietzsche’s 
metaphysics 
from 
just 
one 
perspective, 
although 
in 
each 
case 
it 
is 
a 
perspective 
that 
defines 
the 
whole. 
Thus 
Nietzsche’s 
metaphysics 
is 
grasped 
only 
when 
what 
is 
named 
in 
these 
five 
headings 
can 
be 
thought—that 
is, 
essentially 
experienced—in 
its 
primordial 
and 
heretofore 
merely 
intimated 
conjunction. 
We 
can 
learn 
what 
“nihilism” 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
sense 
is 
only 
if 
we 
also 
comprehend, 
in 
their 
contexts, 
“revaluation 
of 
all 
values 
hitherto,” 
“will 
to 
power,” 
“eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same,” 
and 
“Overman.” 
By 
starting 
from 
an 
adequate 
comprehension 
of 
nihilism 
and 
working 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
we 
can 
also 
acquire 
knowledge 
about 
the 
essence 
of 
revaluation, 
the 
essence 
of 
will 
to 
power, 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same, 
and 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
Overman. 
But 
to 
have 
such 
knowledge 
is 
to 
stand 
within 
the 
moment 
that 
the 
history 
of 
Being 
has 
opened 
up 
for 
our 
age. 


The 
necessity 
of 
having 
to 
think 
the 
essence 
of 
“nihilism” 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
“revaluation 
of 
all 
values,” 
“will 
to 
power,” 
“eternal 
recurrence 
of 
the 
same,” 
and 
the 
“Overman” 
lets 
us 
readily 
surmise 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
nihilism 
is 
in 
itself 
manifold, 
multileveled, 
and 
multifarious. 
The 
word 
nihilism 
therefore 
permits 
many 
applications. 
It 
can 
be 
misused 
as 
an 
empty 
slogan 
or 
epithet 
that 
both 
repels 
and 
discredits 
and 
that 
conceals 
the 
user’s 
own 
thoughtlessness 
from 
him. 
But 
we 
can 
also 
experience 
the 
full 
burden 
of 
what 
the 
name 
says 
when 
uttered 
in 
Nietzsche’s 
sense. 
Here 
it 
means 
to 
think 
the 
history 
of 
Western 
metaphysics 
as 
the 
ground 
of 
our 
own 
history; 
that 
is, 
of 
future 
decisions. 
Finally, 
we 
can 
ponder 
more 
essentially 
what 
Nietzsche 
was 
thinking 
in 
using 
this 
word 
if 
we 
grasp 
his 
“classical 
nihilism” 
as 
that 
nihilism 
whose 
“classicism” 
consists 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
must 
unwittingly 
put 
itself 
on 
extreme 
guard 
against 
knowledge 
of 
its 
innermost 
essence. 
Classical 
nihilism, 
then, 
discloses 
itself 
as 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
nihilism, 
whereby 
it 
considers 
itself 
exempt 
from 
the 
necessity 
of 
thinking 
about 
the 
very 
thing 
that 
constitutes 
its 
essence: 
the 
nihil, 
the 
nothing—as 
the 
veil 
that 
conceals 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Being 
of 
beings.

ALBERT 
CAMUS 


With 
Nietzsche, 
nihilism 
seems 
to 
become 
prophetic. 
But 
we 
can 
draw 
no 
conclusions 
from 
Nietzsche, 
except 
the 
base 
and 
mediocre 
cruelty 
that 
he 
hated 
with 
all 
his 
strength, 
unless 
we 
give 
first 
place 
in 
his 
work—well 
ahead 
of 
the 
prophet—to 
the 
diagnostician. 
The 
provisional, 
methodical, 
strategic 
character 
of 
his 
thought 
cannot 
be 
doubted 
for 
a 
moment. 
With 
him, 
nihilism 
becomes 
conscious 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
Diagnosticians 
have 
this 
in 
common 
with 
prophets—they 
think 
and 
operate 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
future. 
Nietzsche 
never 
thought 
except 
in 
terms 
of 
an 
apocalypse 
to 
come, 
not 
in 
order 
to 
extol 
it, 
for 
he 
guessed 
the 
sordid 
and 
calculating 
aspect 
that 
this 
apocalypse 
would 
finally 
assume, 
but 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
it 
and 
to 
transform 
it 
into 
a 
renaissance. 
He 
recognized 
nihilism 
for 
what 
it 
was 
and 
examined 
it 
like 
a 
clinical 
fact. 


He 
said 
of 
himself 
that 
he 
was 
the 
first 
complete 
nihilist 
of 
Europe. 
Not 
by 
choice, 
but 
by 
condition, 
and 
because 
he 
was 
too 
great 
to 
refuse 
the 
heritage 
of 
his 
time. 
He 
diagnosed 
in 
himself, 
and 
in 
others, 
the 
inability 
to 
believe 
and 
the 
disappearance 
of 
the 
primitive 
foundation 
of 
all 
faith—namely 
the 
belief 
in 
life. 
The 
“Can 
one 
live 
as 
a 
rebel?” 
became 
with 
him 
“Can 
one 
live, 
believing 
in 
nothing?” 
His 
reply 
is 
in 
the 
affirmative. 
Yes, 
if 
one 
creates 
a 
system 
out 
of 
absence 
of 
faith, 
if 
one 
accepts 
the 
final 
consequences 
of 
nihilism, 
and 
if, 
on 
emerging 
into 
the 
desert 
and 
putting 
one’s 
confidence 
in 
what 
is 
going 
to 
come, 
one 
feels, 
with 
the 
same 
primitive 
instinct, 
both 
pain 
and 
joy. 


[…] 


Nietzsche’s 
philosophy, 
undoubtedly, 
revolves 
around 
the 
problem 
of 
rebellion. 
More 
precisely, 
it 
begins 
by 
being 
a 
rebellion. 
But 
we 
sense 
the 
change 
of 
position 
that 
Nietzsche 
makes. 
With 
him, 
rebellion 
begins 
at 
“God 
is 
dead” 
which 
is 
assumed 
as 
an 
established 
fact; 
then 
rebellion 
hinges 
on 
everything 
that 
aims 
at 
falsely 
replacing 
the 
vanished 
deity 
and 
reflects 
dishonour 
on 
a 
world 
which 
undoubtedly 
has 
no 
direction 
but 
which 
remains 



the 
only 
proving-ground 
of 
the 
gods. 


Contrary 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
certain 
of 
his 
Christian 
critics, 
Nietzsche 
did 
not 
form 
a 
project 
to 
kill 
God. 
He 
found 
Him 
dead 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
his 
contemporaries. 
He 
was 
the 
first 
to 
understand 
the 
immense 
importance 
of 
the 
event 
and 
to 
decide 
that 
this 
rebellion 
among 
men 
could 
not 
lead 
to 
a 
renaissance 
unless 
it 
were 
controlled 
and 
directed. 
Any 
other 
attitude 
towards 
it, 
whether 
it 
were 
regret 
or 
complacency, 
must 
lead 
to 
the 
apocalypse. 
Thus 
Nietzsche 
did 
not 
formulate 
a 
philosophy 
of 
rebellion, 
but 
constructed 
a 
philosophy 
on 
rebellion. 


[…] 


In 
Nietzsche’s 
mind, 
the 
only 
problem 
was 
to 
see 
that 
the 
human 
spirit 
bowed 
proudly 
to 
the 
inevitable. 
We 
know, 
however, 
his 
posterity 
and 
the 
kind 
of 
politics 
that 
were 
to 
be 
authorized 
by 
the 
man 
who 
claimed 
to 
be 
the 
last 
anti-political 
German. 
He 
dreamed 
of 
tyrants 
who 
were 
artists. 
But 
tyranny 
comes 
more 
naturally 
than 
art 
to 
mediocre 
men. 
“Rather 
Cesare 
Borgia 
than 
Parsifal,” 
he 
exlaimed. 
He 
begat 
both 
Caesar 
and 
Borgia, 
but 
devoid 
of 
the 
distinction 
of 
feeling 
which 
he 
attributed 
to 
the 
great 
men 
of 
the 
Renaissance. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
his 
insistence 
that 
the 
individual 
should 
bow 
before 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
species 
and 
should 
submerge 
himself 
in 
the 
great 
cycle 
of 
time, 
race 
has 
been 
turned 
into 
a 
special 
aspect 
of 
the 
species 
and 
the 
individual 
has 
been 
made 
to 
bow 
before 
this 
sordid 
god. 
The 
life 
of 
which 
he 
spoke 
with 
such 
fear 
and 
trembling 
has 
been 
degraded 
to 
a 
sort 
of 
biology 
for 
domestic 
use. 
Finally 
a 
race 
of 
vulgar 
overlords, 
with 
a 
blundering 
desire 
for 
power, 
adopted, 
in 
his 
name, 
the 
“anti-semitic 
deformity” 
on 
which 
he 
never 
ceased 
to 
pour 
scorn. 


In 
the 
history 
of 
intelligence, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Marx, 
Nietzsche’s 
adventure 
has 
no 
equivalent: 
we 
shall 
never 
finish 
making 
reparation 
for 
the 
injustice 
done 
to 
him. 
Of 
course 
history 
records 
other 
philosophies 
that 
have 
been 
misconstrued 
and 
betrayed. 
But 
up 
to 
the 
time 
of 
Nietzsche 
and 
national 
socialism, 
it 
was 
quite 
without 
parallel 
that 
a 
process 
of 
thought—brilliantly 
illuminated 
by 
the 
nobility 
and 
by 
the 
sufferings 
of 
an 
exceptional 
mind— 
should 
have 
been 
demonstrated 
to 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
world 
by 
a 
parade 
of 
lies 
and 
by 
the 
hideous 
accumulation 
of 
corpses 
from 
concentration 
camps. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
the 
superman 
led 
to 
the 
methodical 
creation 
of 
submen—a 
fact 
that 
doubtless 
should 
be 
denounced 
but 
which 
also 
demands 
interpretation. 
If 



the 
final 
result 
of 
the 
great 
movement 
of 
rebellion 
in 
the 
nineteenth 
and 
twentieth 
centuries 
was 
to 
be 
this 
ruthless 
bondage 
then 
surely 
rebellion 
should 
be 
rejected 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
desperate 
cry 
to 
his 
contemporaries 
taken 
up: 
“My 
conscience 
and 
yours 
are 
no 
longer 
the 
same 
conscience.”

DELEUZE 


The 
eternal 
return 
is 
as 
badly 
misunderstood 
as 
the 
will 
to 
power. 
Every 
time 
we 
understand 
the 
eternal 
return 
as 
the 
return 
of 
a 
particular 
arrangement 
of 
things 
after 
all 
the 
other 
arrangements 
have 
been 
realised, 
every 
time 
we 
interpret 
the 
eternal 
return 
as 
the 
return 
of 
the 
identical 
or 
the 
same, 
we 
replace 
Nietzsche’s 
thought 
with 
childish 
hypotheses. 
No 
one 
extended 
the 
critique 
of 
all 
forms 
of 
identity 
further 
than 
Nietzsche. 
On 
two 
occasions 
in 
Zarathustra 
Nietzsche 
explicitly 
denies 
that 
the 
eternal 
return 
is 
a 
circle 
which 
makes 
the 
same 
return. 
The 
eternal 
return 
is 
the 
strict 
opposite 
of 
this 
since 
it 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
a 
selection, 
from 
a 
double 
selection. 
Firstly, 
there 
is 
the 
selection 
of 
willing 
or 
of 
thought 
which 
constitutes 
Nietzsche’s 
ethics: 
only 
will 
that 
of 
which 
one 
also 
wills 
the 
eternal 
return 
(to 
eliminate 
all 
half-willing, 
everything 
which 
can 
only 
be 
willed 
with 
the 
proviso 
“once, 
only 
once”). 
Secondly, 
there 
is 
the 
selection 
of 
being 
which 
constitutes 
Nietzsche’s 
ontology: 
only 
that 
which 
becomes 
in 
the 
fullest 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
can 
return, 
is 
fit 
to 
return. 
Only 
action 
and 
affirmation 
return: 
becoming 
has 
being 
and 
only 
becoming 
has 
being. 
That 
which 
is 
opposed 
to 
becoming, 
the 
same 
or 
the 
identical, 
strictly 
speaking, 
is 
not. 
The 
negative 
as 
the 
lowest 
degree 
of 
power, 
the 
reactive 
as 
the 
lowest 
degree 
of 
force, 
do 
not 
return 
because 
they 
are 
the 
opposite 
of 
becoming 
and 
only 
becoming 
has 
being. 
We 
can 
thus 
see 
how 
the 
eternal 
return 
is 
linked, 
not 
to 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
same, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary, 
to 
a 
transmutation. 
It 
is 
the 
moment 
or 
the 
eternity 
of 
becoming 
which 
eliminates 
all 
that 
resists 
it. 
It 
releases, 
indeed 
it 
creates, 
the 
purely 
active 
and 
pure 
affirmation. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
sole 
content 
of 
the 
Overman; 
he 
is 
the 
joint 
product 
of 
the 
will 
to 
power 
and 
the 
eternal 
return, 
Dionysus 
and 
Ariadne. 
This 
is 
why 
Nietzsche 
says 
that 
the 
will 
to 
power 
is 



not 
wanting, 
coveting 
or 
seeking 
power, 
but 
only 
“giving” 
or 
“creating.” 


But 
the 
difficulty 
of 
Nietzsche 
depends 
less 
on 
conceptual 
analysis 
than 
on 
practical 
evaluations 
which 
evoke 
a 
whole 
atmosphere, 
all 
kinds 
of 
emotional 
dispositions 
in 
the 
reader. 
Like 
Spinoza, 
Nietzsche 
always 
maintained 
that 
there 
is 
the 
deepest 
relationship 
between 
concept 
and 
affect. 
Conceptual 
analyses 
are 
indispensable 
and 
Nietzsche 
takes 
them 
further 
than 
anyone 
else. 
But 
they 
will 
always 
be 
ineffective 
if 
the 
reader 
grasps 
them 
in 
an 
atmosphere 
which 
is 
not 
that 
of 
Nietzsche. 
As 
long 
as 
the 
reader 
persists 
in: 
1) 
seeing 
the 
Nietzschean 
“slave” 
as 
someone 
who 
finds 
himself 
dominated 
by 
a 
master, 
and 
deserves 
to 
be; 
2) 
understanding 
the 
will 
to 
power 
as 
a 
will 
which 
wants 
and 
seeks 
power; 
3) 
conceiving 
the 
eternal 
return 
as 
the 
tedious 
return 
of 
the 
same; 
4) 
imagining 
the 
Overman 
as 
a 
given 
master 
race—no 
positive 
relationship 
between 
Nietzsche 
and 
his 
reader 
will 
be 
possible. 
Nietzsche 
will 
appear 
a 
nihilist, 
or 
worse, 
a 
fascist 
and 
at 
best 
as 
an 
obscure 
and 
terrifying 
prophet. 
Nietzsche 
knew 
this, 
he 
knew 
the 
fate 
that 
lay 
in 
store 
for 
him, 
he 
who 
gave 
Zarathustra 
an 
“ape” 
or 
“buffoon” 
as 
a 
double, 
foretelling 
that 
Zarathustra 
would 
be 
confused 
with 
his 
ape 
(a 
prophet, 
a 
fascist 
or 
a 
madman 
…). 
This 
is 
why 
a 
book 
about 
Nietzsche 
must 
try 
hard 
to 
correct 
the 
practical 
or 
emotional 
misunderstanding 
as 
well 
as 
re-establishing 
the 
conceptual 
analysis. 


And 
it 
is 
indeed 
true 
that 
Nietzsche 
diagnosed 
nihilism 
as 
the 
movement 
which 
carries 
history 
forward. 
No 
one 
has 
analysed 
the 
concept 
of 
nihilism 
better 
than 
he 
did, 
he 
invented 
the 
concept. 
But 
it 
is 
important 
to 
see 
that 
he 
defined 
it 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
triumph 
of 
reactive 
forces 
or 
the 
negative 
in 
the 
will 
to 
power. 
To 
nihilism 
he 
opposed 
transmutation, 
that 
is 
the 
becoming 
which 
is 
simultaneously 
the 
only 
action 
of 
force 
and 
the 
only 
affirmation 
of 
power, 
the 
transhistoric 
element 
of 
man, 
the 
Overman 
(and 
not 
the 
superman). 
The 
Overman 
is 
the 
focal 
point, 
where 
the 
reactive 
(ressentiment 
and 
bad 
conscience) 
is 
conquered, 
and 
where 
the 
negative 
gives 
way 
to 
affirmation. 
Nietzsche 
remains 
inseparable, 
at 
every 
moment, 
from 
the 
forces 
of 
the 
future, 
from 
the 
forces 
yet 
to 
come 
that 
his 
prayers 
invoke, 
that 
his 
thought 
outlines, 
that 
his 
art 
prefigures. 
He 
not 
only 
diagnoses, 
as 
Kafka 
put 
it, 
the 
diabolical 
forces 
already 
knocking 
at 
the 
door, 
but 
he 
exorcises 
them 
by 
raising 
the 
last 
Power 
capable 
of 
struggling 
with 
them, 
against 
them, 
and 
of 
ousting 
them 
both 
within 
us 
and 
outside 
us. 
A 
Nietzschean 
“aphorism” 
is 
not 
a 
mere 
fragment, 
a 
morsel 
of 
thought: 
it 
is 
a 
proposition 
which 
only 
makes 
sense 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
state 
of 
forces 
that 
it 
expresses, 
and 
which 
changes 



sense, 
which 
must 
change 
sense, 
according 
to 
the 
new 
forces 
which 
it 
is 
“capable” 
(has 
the 
power) 
of 
attracting. 


And 
without 
doubt 
this 
is 
the 
most 
important 
point 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
philosophy: 
the 
radical 
transformation 
of 
the 
image 
of 
thought 
that 
we 
create 
for 
ourselves. 
Nietzsche 
snatches 
thought 
from 
the 
element 
of 
truth 
and 
falsity. 
He 
turns 
it 
into 
an 
interpretation 
and 
an 
evaluation, 
interpretation 
of 
forces, 
evaluation 
of 
power.—It 
is 
a 
thought-movement, 
not 
merely 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
Nietzsche 
wants 
to 
reconcile 
thought 
and 
concrete 
movement, 
but 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
thought 
itself 
must 
produce 
movements, 
bursts 
of 
extraordinary 
speed 
and 
slowness 
(here 
again 
we 
can 
see 
the 
role 
of 
the 
aphorism, 
with 
its 
variable 
speeds 
and 
its 
“projectile-like” 
movement). 
As 
a 
result 
philosophy 
has 
a 
new 
relationship 
to 
the 
arts 
of 
movement: 
theatre, 
dance 
and 
music. 
Nietzsche 
was 
never 
satisfied 
with 
the 
discourse 
or 
the 
dissertation 
(logos) 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
philosophical 
thought, 
although 
he 
wrote 
the 
finest 
dissertations—notably 
the 
Genealogy 
of 
Morals, 
to 
which 
all 
modern 
ethnology 
owes 
an 
inexhaustible 
“debt.” 
But 
a 
book 
like 
Zarathustra 
can 
only 
be 
read 
as 
a 
modern 
opera 
and 
seen 
and 
heard 
as 
such. 
It 
is 
not 
that 
Nietzsche 
produces 
a 
philosophical 
opera 
or 
a 
piece 
of 
allegorical 
theatre, 
but 
he 
creates 
a 
piece 
of 
theatre 
or 
an 
opera 
which 
directly 
expresses 
thought 
as 
experience 
and 
movement. 
And 
when 
Nietzsche 
says 
that 
the 
Overman 
resembles 
a 
Borgia 
rather 
than 
a 
Parsifal, 
or 
that 
he 
is 
a 
member 
of 
both 
the 
order 
of 
Jesuits 
and 
the 
Prussian 
officer 
corps, 
it 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
see 
these 
as 
protofascist 
statements, 
since 
they 
are 
the 
remarks 
of 
a 
director 
indicating 
how 
the 
Overman 
should 
be 
“played” 
(rather 
like 
Kierkegaard 
saying 
that 
the 
knight 
of 
the 
faith 
is 
like 
a 
bourgeois 
in 
his 
Sunday 
best).—To 
think 
is 
to 
create: 
this 
is 
Nietzsche’s 
greatest 
lesson. 
To 
think, 
to 
cast 
the 
dice 
… 
: 
this 
was 
already 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
eternal 
return.

1. 
Nietzsche 
remains 
one 
of 
the 
most 
influential 
philosophers 
of 
our 
time. 
As 
Walter 
Kaufmann 
notes, 
“No 
other 
philosopher 
since 
Plato 
and 
Aristotle, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Kant 
and 
Hegel, 
has 
influenced 
so 
many 
widely 
different 
thinkers 
and 
writers 
so 
profoundly.” 
What 
are 
some 
of 
the 
main 
aspects 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
influence, 
and 
what 
are 
some 
of 
the 
factors 
that 
account 
for 
his 
tremendous 
and 
enduring 
influence? 
2. 
One 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
major 
themes 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
“the 
eternal 
recurrence.” 
What 
do 
you 
think 
Nietzsche 
was 
attempting 
to 
do 
with 
this 
idea? 
What 
does 
he 
seem 
to 
mean 
by 
it? 
What 
are 
its 
implications? 
3. 
As 
Peter 
Gay 
notes, 
Nietzsche 
has 
been 
one 
of 
the 
most 
persistently 
misunderstood 
writers 
in 
the 
history 
of 
Western 
thought. 
What 
are 
some 
of 
the 
misunderstandings 
that 
have 
attended 
his 
work? 
Are 
some 
thinkers 
more 
easily 
misappropriated 
than 
others? 
4. 
Nietzsche’s 
style 
is 
particularly 
iconoclastic 
and 
unique; 
as 
Walter 
Kaufmann 
notes, 
“Nietzsche 
clearly 
wanted 
to 
be 
read 
with 
a 
delighted 
awareness 
of 
nuances 
of 
style 
and 
thought.” 
Discuss 
how 
Nietzsche’s 
style—which 
often 
condenses 
complex 
ideas 
into 
seemingly 
simple 
phrases—works 
to 
inform 
your 
reading 
or 
understanding 
of 
his 
thought. 
Is 
Nietzsche’s 
style 
inseparable 
from 
his 
meaning? 
5. 
ne 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
favorite 
devices 
is 
the 
aphorism. 
Why 
is 
this 
form 
significant 
for 
Nietzsche? 
What 
does 
he 
accomplish 
by 
writing 
in 
this 
way? 
Can 
all 
of 
his 
writing 
be 
said 
to 
be 
in 
some 
way 
aphoristic? 
6. 
For 
Nietzsche, 
the 
most 
important 
philosophy 
is 
always 
“untimely,” 
and 
Nietzsche 
had 
a 
particularly 
complicated 
and 
contentious 
relationship 
toward 
many 
of 
his 
contemporaries, 
for 
instance 
Wagner. 
Discuss 
Nietzsche’s 
various 
attitudes 
toward 
his 
contemporaries 
as 
stated 
in 
Basic 
Writings, 
and 
conversely 
the 
ideas, 
figures, 
and 
ways 

of 
thinking 
that 
Nietzsche 
seems 
to 
find 
most 
sympathetic 
to 
his 
own 
philosophy. 


7. 
Nietzsche 
has 
been 
considered 
a 
nihilist, 
and 
also 
a 
philosopher 
who 
more 
than 
anything 
sought 
to 
transcend 
nihilism. 
Discuss 
the 
idea 
of 
nihilism 
in 
broad 
terms, 
and 
Nietzsche’s 
use 
or 
development 
of 
this 
idea. 
8. 
What, 
for 
Nietzsche, 
is 
the 
“will 
to 
power”? 
9. 
Throughout 
Nietzsche’s 
work 
is 
a 
call 
for 
a 
new 
philosophy, 
for 
radical 
breaks 
with 
various 
conventional 
ideas 
and 
methodologies, 
and 
for 
new 
philosophers. 
What 
are 
some 
of 
Nietzsche’s 
hopes 
for 
the 
future 
of 
philosophy?
