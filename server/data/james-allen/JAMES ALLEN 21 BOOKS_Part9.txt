                            TRUTH TRIUMPHANT


  There is no height to which thou canst not climb;

   There is no grandeur that thou may’st not view,

  If thou wilt reach beyond the things of Time,

   Unto the Pure, the Beautiful, the True.

  There is no saintly vision, no glad sight

   Of seer, nor no dream of holy sage

  But may be thine; nay, is thy heavenly right,

  If thou wilt claim thy regal appanage.

  There is no sin but thou may’st overthrow;

   There is no vileness that, octopus-like,

  Binds thee its victim, but thou soon canst know

   The way and weapon thy strong foe to strike.

  Thou art not framed for sin and grief and shame;

   Thou art not bent to grovel in the mire;

  But thou art made erect, and given a name,

   Hast hands to reach, and spirit to aspire.

  Glory and strength and triumph — these are thine;

   Rise up, and conquer every inward foe;

  Behold the heavens, how radiantly they shine!

   Stand up and strike, O conqueror of woe!              O THOU WHO WOULD’ST TEACH!


  O thou who would’st teach men of Truth!

   Hast thou passed through the desert of doubt?

  Art thou purged by the fires of sorrow? hath ruth

      The fiends of opinion cast out

  Of thy human heart? Is thy soul so fair

  That no false thought can ever harbour there?

  O thou who would’st teach men of Love!

   Hast thou passed through the place of despair?

  Hast thou wept through the dark night of grief? does it move

      (Now freed from its sorrow and care)

  Thy human heart to pitying gentleness,

  Looking on wrong, and hate, and ceaseless stress?

  O thou who would’st teach men of Peace!

   Hast thou crossed the wide ocean of strife?

  Hast thou found on the Shores of the Silence, release

      From all the wild unrest of life?

  From thy human heart hath all striving gone,

  Leaving but Truth, and Love, and Peace alone?        IF THOU WOULD’ST RIGHT THE WORLD


   If thou would’st right the world,

  And banish all its evils and its woes,

   Make its wild places bloom,

  And its drear deserts blossom as the rose,—

      Then right thyself.

   If thou would’st turn the world

  From its long, lone captivity in sin,

   Restore all broken hearts,

  Slay grief, and let sweet consolation in, —

      Turn thou thyself.

   It thou would’st cure the world

  Of its long sickness, end its grief and pain,

   Bring in all-healing Joy,

  And give to the afflicted rest again,—

      Then cure thyself.

   If thou would’st wake the world

  Out of its dream of death and dark’ning strife,

   Bring it to Love and Peace,

  And Light and brightness of immortal Life,—

      Wake thou thyself.                          WHAT OF THE NIGHT?


  What of the night, O Watchman! see’st thou yet

   The glimmering dawn upon the mountain heights

   The golden Herald of the Light of lights,

  Are his fair feet upon the hilltops set?

  Cometh he yet to chase away the gloom,

   And with it all the demons of the Night?

   Strike yet his darting rays upon thy sight?

    Hear’st thou his voice, the sound of error’s doom?

  The Morning cometh, lover of the Light;

   E’en now He gilds with gold the mountain’s brow,

   Dimly I see the path whereon e’en now

  His shining feet are set toward the Night.

    Darkness shall pass away, and all the things

   That love the darkness, and that hate the Light

   Shall disappear for ever with the Night:

  Rejoice! for thus the speeding Herald sings.                                    KNOWLEDGE


  We find the Good by being good, the True

   By being true, the Real by dissolving

  Our fond illusions, thereby piercing through

   Shadow, and knowing substance. By resolving,

  We can attain, and by attaining, know;

   And, knowing, who shall cause us grief or harm?

  What trembling victim of the world’s vain show

   Shall pierce the armoured heart, or foil the arm

  Of him whose Shield is Wisdom? What event,

   What circumstance, what mutability

  Can shake the Changeless? And whoso hath blent

   His life with Changeless Good, stands steadfastly

  In Knowledge, fearing nothing, hating naught;

  His heart and mind Love-fashioned, Wisdom-wrought.                              THE END OF EVIL


  All evil passes from us when we find

  The Way of Good; when word and deed and mind

  Are shaped to Truth and Wisdom; then we see

  The end of bondage and captivity.

  All good is ever with us; we but want

  Wisdom to take it; we are poor and scant

  Only in lacking wisdom; that acquired,

  The good is ours that we so long desired.

  Be stilt any soul and know that peace is thine;

  Be steadfast, heart, and know that strength divine

  Belongs to thee: cease from thy turmoil, mind,

  And thou the Everlasting Rest shalt find.                                    MAN DIVINE


  Man is superior to sin and shame,

   Evil and error he will yet dethrone,

  The beasts within he will o’ercome and tame,

   The brute will pass, the Angel will be known;

  Yea, even now the Man divine appears,

  Crowned with conquest, victor o’er all fears.

  Hail to thee, Man divine! the conqueror

   Of sin and shame and sorrow; no more weak,

    Wormlike and grovelling art thou; no, nor

   Wilt thou again bow down to things that wreak

    Scourgings and death upon thee; thou dost rise

    Triumphant in thy strength; good, pure, and wise.                                        PATIENCE


  Why this fierce struggle to achieve thine ends?

  This selfish argument? This fire which lends

   Heat to resentment, ashes to remorse?

  Canst thou bend Truth and Nature to thy will?

  Bend thou, and work and wait; be strong and still;

   Soft growth is stronger than vehement force.

  Be as a flower, content to be, to grow

  In sweetness day by day; content to know

   The hidden blessing in the seeming curse;

  A child of Love, unargumentative;

  Content to be and know — as thou dost live—

   The simple secret of the Universe.                                        RESTORED


  Eager for strife and struggle, Self and gain,

   And heeding not the gentle Voice of Truth,

  We strive and wrestle in dark ways of pain,

  And, blind and lost in passion, we disdain

   The unobtrusive Way of Love and ruth;

  So live we on in sorrow and in woe,

  Nor rest can find, nor blessed gladness know.

  Tired of strife and anger, hate and pain,

   And weary of the wranglings of the Schools,

  We turn, and look into your face again,

  Beloved brother, sister; nor in vain

   Search we with purer eyes; but as in pools

  Soft, deep, and silent, gaze we, finding rest;

  So pass we on our way, refreshed and blest.                ON RELEASING A CAPTIVE BIRD


  I found a little bird held fast, ensnared

   By ruthless hands; a gentle, captive prey

  Thirsting for freedom, piteously scared,

   Struggling in vain to ’scape and soar away.

  I marked his terror, and I took him up;

   His fluttering heart spoke out his wild despair.

  "Look, you and I with the great gods shall sup

   This day," I said; then threw him into air.

  Whereat he soared, and wheeled, and flew away;

   Great was his joy, and ruth - born bliss was mine;

  Thus supped we both with the high gods that day;

   Thus tasted we their nectar, drank their wine.                        ART THOU IN SORROW?


  Art thou in sorrow? Art thou in despair,

   Involved in doubt and deep perplexity?

  Leave thou thyself, and with thy fellows share

   The good thou hast, and thou wilt blessed be.

  Let Love’s bright sunshine play upon your heart;

   Come now unto your gladness, peace, and rest;

  Bid the dark shades of selfishness depart,

   And now and evermore be truly blest.                                WHEN I AM PURE


   When I am pure

  I shall have solved the mystery of life,

   I shall be sure,

  When I am free from hatred, lust, and strife,

  I am in Truth, and Truth abides in me.

  I shall be safe and sane and wholly free

   When I am pure.                                  IMMORTALITY


  He shall not die who seeks the Way of Truth;

  He shall not see the corruption who doth walk

  With stainless feet the Path of Purity;

  He shall not wander in dark worlds of woe

  Who finds the Gate of Good and enters there,

  For he shall taste of immortality

  While feasting at the table of his Lord.                          ARE YOU SEARCHING?


  Are you searching for the happiness that does not fade away?

  Are you looking for the joy that lives, and leaves no grievous day?

  Are you panting for the waterbrooks of Love, and Life, and Peace?

  Then let all dark desires depart, and selfish seeking cease.

  Are you ling’ring in the paths of pain, grief-haunted, stricken sore?

  Are you wand’ring in the ways that wound your weary feet the more?

  Are you sighing for the Resting-Place where tears and sorrows cease?

  Then sacrifice the heart of self, and find the Heart of Peace.

          THE KNIGHTS OF NOSTRADAMUS


Based on prophecies, mysteries, and ancient secrets, in this original series of

four novels, each book is about one piece of a big cosmic puzzle…

 

    I.CIRCLE OF POWER (Four Prophecies).

In 1553, in a little city of France, Michelle de Nostradamus predicted that at

the end of the millennium a series of drastic changes would alter the world’s

structures of power forever. For centuries, in their innermost core, human

beings feared those fatidic dates.

However,  the  millennium  arrived  and  nothing  seemed  to  happen.

Nostradamus prophecies and all other prophecies regarding the end of the

world failed miserably. Then again, there was 2012, and again the prophecies

did not fulfill.

Everybody celebrated happily and relieved; and lives returned to normality.

But a series of events are about to change that state of relaxation…

In Paris, the Mona Lisa is stolen from the Louvre…

In Milan, the author of a book that promises to reveal the biggest secrets of

Leonardo Da Vinci is killed and his manuscripts disappear…

In Rome, the ambassador of a small country is assassinated in a terrorist

attack, leaving a shadow of mystery behind…

Ricardo Díaz, a man who cannot find sense to his life, is sent as the new

ambassador to investigate the murder. And from that moment on, death will

follow him, as he gets involved in a world wide conspiracy of unimaginable

reach and consequences.

Without even knowing, he is about to reveal the enigmas of the Circle of

Ancestral Power, a group of European Nobles that strives to regain the power

of the world inspired and guided by the secrets of Leonardo Da Vinci and the

prophecies  of  Nostradamus.  How  far  would  that  group  go  to  make  those

prophecies come true?

 

    II.THE PYRAMID OF APOCALYPSEWhat  really  happened  at  the  Great  Flood?  Did  Noah  bring  some  ancient

secrets to the new born World? Is the real apocalypse, the revelation, about to

begin?

Those are the secrets that a recently divorced and on sabbatical archeologist

Stefano Della Crocce would have to uncover, while at the same time, learning

about the secrets of his family, hidden for many, many generations.

    On Ebook July 2014.

 

    III. THE CHALICE

All the great prophets had a chalice. From the Holy Grail to Da Vinci; from

Nostradamus  to  Jules  Verne  and  William  Atkinson,  there  was  always a

chalice. Was it the same? Has it the power to communicate with Something?

Where is that chalice now, if indeed it exists? Who has it, and Why is it so

important for the groups seeking world domination?

Soon on Ebook.

 

    IV. THE THIRTEEN PROPHECY: THE GATES OF EDEN

No information will be offered on this book, until the very day of its release.
