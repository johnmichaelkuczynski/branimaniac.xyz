PHILOSOPHY 

1. The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics.
2. The universe is open to the direct reading of those who know this language.
3. In questions of science, the authority of thousands is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.
4. The Sun, with all the planets revolving around it, is the center of the universe.
5. The Earth is not the center of the universe, but rather moves around the Sun.
6. The Earth's motion is a real, physical motion, not merely a mathematical convenience.
7. The Moon has an Earth-like surface, with mountains and valleys.
8. The heavens are not perfect and immutable but are subject to change and generation.
9. Jupiter has four moons that revolve around it, constituting a miniature planetary system.
10. These Jovian moons prove that not all celestial motion circles the Earth.
11. The Milky Way is not a nebulous vapor but is composed of a multitude of faint stars.
12. Sunspots are real phenomena on or very near the body of the Sun itself.
13. The Sun rotates on its axis, as evidenced by the motion of sunspots.
14. Venus shows a complete set of phases, which is only possible if it orbits the Sun.
15. Sensory experience, aided by instruments, is the foundation of knowledge about the natural world.
16. Pure logical deduction without observation is insufficient for understanding nature.
17. In scientific disputes, one must not rely on the authority of ancient texts but on sense experience and necessary demonstrations.
18. Tastes, odors, and colors reside only in the consciousness of the sentient body and have no true existence outside it.
19. Only properties like figure, number, and motion—the primary qualities—truly exist in external matter.
20. Motion is nothing other than a change in the relation of one material object to another.
21. There is no absolute "rest" or absolute "motion," only motion relative to an observer.
22. A body moving on a perfectly level surface with no impediments would continue in motion forever.
23. All bodies, regardless of weight, would fall at the same speed in a vacuum.
24. The distance a falling body travels is proportional to the square of the time elapsed.
25. The path of a projectile is a parabola.
26. The resistance of materials to breaking depends on their geometrical shape and dimensions, not just their substance.
27. There is a true and measurable science of the strength of materials.
28. The Bible teaches how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.
29. Scripture and nature proceed from the same divine word, so they cannot contradict each other when properly interpreted.
30. When a demonstrated physical truth seems to contradict Scripture, the Scriptural passage must be reinterpreted.
31. The purpose of the Holy Ghost is to teach us how to go to heaven, not to instruct us in astronomy.
32. The senses must be trusted when they are properly aided and conditions for observation are correct.
33. The universe is infinite, or at least incomparably larger than previously believed.
34. The stars are not fixed to a celestial sphere but are scattered at immense and varying distances.
35. The Moon does not have its own light but shines by reflected sunlight.
36. The "ashen light" on the dark part of the Moon is caused by sunlight reflected from the Earth.
37. The Earth, seen from the Moon, would appear as a luminous disk in the lunar sky.
38. The apparent size of stars as seen with the naked eye is a spurious effect caused by irradiation.
39. The telescope reveals the true, point-like nature of stars.
40. Nature is inexorable and immutable and cares not whether her secret reasons are understandable to men.
41. Philosophical arguments based on authority alone are worthless.
42. I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him.
43. You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him discover it within himself.
44. Mathematics is the key with which we can unlock the secrets of the physical world.
45. The acceleration of falling bodies is uniform and follows a simple mathematical law.
46. The period of a pendulum's swing is independent of the amplitude of the swing.
47. A vacuum is possible and has real physical properties.
48. Air has weight and exerts pressure.
49. The motion of a body is determined by the sum of all the forces acting upon it.
50. Circular motion is not "natural" for celestial bodies in the Aristotelian sense but is governed by the same principles as terrestrial motion.
51. The Copernican system is not just a hypothesis for calculation but represents physical reality.
52. The traditional Aristotelian cosmology is physically impossible and philosophically unsound.
53. The tides are caused primarily by the combined motion of the Earth's rotation and revolution, sloshing the seas.
54. The fixed stars are immensely distant to explain the lack of observable parallax.
55. Doubt is the father of invention and the necessary precursor to all discovery.
56. Nature does not act by means of many things when it can act by means of a few.
57. The variety of effects perceived in nature stems from a few simple causes and principles.
58. The same laws of motion apply to both celestial and terrestrial bodies.
59. One must measure what is measurable and make measurable what is not so.
60. There is no greater hatred in the world than the hatred of ignorance for knowledge.
61. Facts which seem at first improbable are not necessarily to be denied but must be examined with greater care.
62. It is a beautiful and delightful sight to behold the body of the Moon.
63. By denying scientific principles, one may maintain any paradox.
64. The truth is not found by following the opinion of the majority but by reasoning from evidence.
65. The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language in which it is written.
66. Names and definitions must not be allowed to dominate the investigation of facts.
67. The testimony of nature is the most reliable testimony of all.
68. I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect intended us to forgo their use.
69. To command the professors of astronomy to confute their own observations is to command them not to see what they do see.
70. The number of planets is not limited to those known to the ancients.
71. New instruments extend the powers of our senses and reveal new truths.
72. A scientific theory must be able to account for all observed phenomena.
73. The simplicity of the Copernican system is a mark of its truth.
74. Philosophical arguments about the natural world must be resolved by appeals to nature, not to books.
75. The search for truth is more precious than its possession.
76. In the sciences, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single person.
77. The universe stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is written.
78. The Moon is a solid, opaque, spherical body, illuminated by the Sun.
79. The surface of the Moon is full of cavities and prominences, like the face of the Earth.
80. The height of lunar mountains can be calculated from the lengths of their shadows.
81. The dark spots on the Moon are not stains but deep cavities.
82. The bright spots on the Moon are high mountains and the rims of cavities.
83. The planets are bodies analogous to the Earth, opaque and receiving light from the Sun.
84. The planets show distinct, measurable disks, unlike the point-like stars.
85. Saturn's unusual appearance is due to a ring that surrounds it.
86. The Mediccan Stars (Jupiter's moons) have periods of revolution that can be calculated and predicted.
87. These periods provide a potential method for determining longitude at sea.
88. The apparent increase in the size of planets when seen through a telescope is real, while the apparent increase in stars is not.
89. The power of a lens to magnify is a function of its curvature.
90. The imperfections seen in celestial bodies refute the doctrine of perfect, incorruptible heavens.
91. The universe is a grand book which stands continually open to our eyes.
92. I value the discovery of a single truth more highly than all the argumentation on all other questions.
93. The testimony of a single observed fact is worth more than the volumes of dialectical argument.
94. The freedom of scientific inquiry is essential for the discovery of truth.
95. One should not presume that human understanding is the measure of all things in nature.
96. The motion of a uniformly accelerated body can be analyzed by considering its mean speed.
97. The strength of a beam to resist breaking is proportional to the square of its depth.
98. Sound is produced by rapid vibrations that cause waves in the air.
99. The pitch of a sound is determined by the frequency of these vibrations.
100. The study of nature is the most noble and worthwhile pursuit of the human mind, revealing the majesty of God's creation.
