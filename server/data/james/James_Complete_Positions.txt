### The Scope and Method of Psychology

1. Psychology is the science of mental life—its phenomena and their conditions.

2. Mental states are not merely accompaniments of brain-states but are causally efficacious in their own right.

3. The psychologist must adopt a provisional dualism, treating mind and body as distinct for methodological purposes.

4. Introspection is a valid but fallible method; it cannot capture mental states in their pristine form since observation alters what is observed.

5. The pursuit of purely associationist psychology fails because it cannot account for the selective, purposive character of mind.

6. Psychology cannot be purely physiological because subjective experience is irreducible to neural description.

7. The "psychologist's fallacy" occurs when we confuse our knowledge of a mental state with the mental state itself as experienced by the subject.

8. Every mental state is a function of the entire brain-state at that moment, not of isolated neural pathways.

---

### The Brain and Neural Function

9. The brain is the immediate organ of the mind; no mental modification occurs without a correlative neural change.

10. The hemispheres are the seat of all consciousness; subcortical structures mediate only reflex and automatic functions.

11. Neural pathways are strengthened through use; habit has a physical basis in the plasticity of neural tissue.

12. The brain works as a whole, not as a collection of independent faculties localized in discrete regions.

13. Consciousness accompanies only the highest, most unstable neural processes—not fixed, automatic ones.

14. The law of neural habit: currents once flowing through a path leave that path more permeable for future currents.

15. Reflex action is the fundamental type of neural function; all higher processes are elaborations of the reflex arc.

16. The nervous system is fundamentally an organ for transforming sensory stimulation into motor response.

---

### Habit

17. Habit is the flywheel of society, its most precious conservative agent.

18. Every action leaves a trace in the nervous system, making repetition easier.

19. Habits simplify movements, diminish conscious attention, and reduce fatigue.

20. The period of youth is critical for habit formation; neural plasticity diminishes with age.

21. To acquire a new habit, launch with as strong initiative as possible and permit no exceptions until the habit is firmly established.

22. Never allow an acquired habit to go unused; each lapse weakens the neural pathway.

23. Seize every opportunity to act on resolutions; intentions not translated into action lose their motivating power.

24. Habitual action eventually becomes entirely automatic, requiring no conscious attention.

25. Character is essentially a bundle of habits; moral reformation is primarily a matter of habit-change.

---

### The Stream of Consciousness

26. Consciousness is not a chain of discrete ideas but a continuous stream or flow.

27. No mental state can recur identically; every thought is unique to the moment of its occurrence.

28. Within the stream, there are substantive parts (stable images and concepts) and transitive parts (feelings of relation, tendency, and direction).

29. The transitive parts are as genuinely cognitive as the substantive parts, though harder to introspect.

30. Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness; thoughts are always owned.

31. Consciousness is always changing; even the same object is never thought of in precisely the same way twice.

32. Consciousness is sensibly continuous; even after gaps (as in sleep), we feel a continuity of self.

33. Consciousness is selective; it chooses from among stimuli and emphasizes, ignores, or suppresses according to interest.

34. The fringe or halo surrounding every thought is as important as its nucleus; it provides context and meaning.

35. We think in wholes, not in atomic sensations; the unit of mental life is the total pulse of thought.

36. The feeling of "and," "if," "but," and "by" are genuine states of consciousness, though they resist introspective isolation.

37. Thought is always directed toward an object; consciousness is essentially intentional.

38. The specious present—the felt duration of the now—has a finite span of several seconds.

---

### The Self

39. The self is not a single entity but comprises the material self, the social self, and the spiritual self.

40. The material self includes the body, clothing, family, and possessions; threats to these produce genuine emotional reactions.

41. We have as many social selves as there are individuals who recognize us and carry images of us in their minds.

42. The spiritual self is the inner core of felt activity, the source of effort and attention.

43. Self-esteem equals success divided by pretensions; lowering pretensions raises self-esteem as effectively as increasing success.

44. The pure ego or "I" is the thinker, the judging thought itself, not a separate substantial soul.

45. Personal identity is constituted by the felt continuity of the stream of consciousness and the resemblance of successive selves.

46. Each passing thought appropriates the preceding thoughts and the self they knew; identity is a matter of appropriation, not underlying substance.

47. The sense of personal identity does not require belief in a soul-substance; functional continuity suffices.

48. Rivalry between different selves (e.g., professional vs. social) creates internal conflict; we cannot maximize all our potential selves.

---

### Attention

49. Attention is the taking possession by the mind of one out of several possible objects or trains of thought.

50. Attention implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others.

51. Only those items to which we attend become objects of distinct perception and memory.

52. Voluntary attention is always derived; it depends on the interest attached to the topic through association.

53. Sustained attention to an unchanging object is impossible; attention naturally fluctuates.

54. Genius is essentially the power of sustained voluntary attention.

55. What we attend to is determined by interest; interest is the selective agency in all cognition.

56. Attention is not merely passive reception but involves active accommodation and anticipatory preparation.

57. The effort of attention is the essential phenomenon of will.

58. Attention does not create ideas but allows certain ideas to dominate consciousness and determine action.

---

### Conception and Reasoning

59. Conception is the function by which we identify a thing as belonging to a kind.

60. The same object can be conceived in radically different ways depending on which of its aspects we attend to.

61. Concepts abstract essential characters from the flux of perception, enabling stable thought.

62. The essence of a thing is relative to the purpose for which we conceive it; no absolute essence exists.

63. Reasoning is the ability to extract abstract characters from concretes and perceive their implications.

64. The art of reasoning is the ability to select the right characters to emphasize for the purpose at hand.

65. The thinking mind proceeds from one concrete to another by extracting an attribute common to both.

66. Association by similarity is the fundamental basis of all reasoning; genius lies in perceiving unexpected similarities.

---

### Discrimination and Comparison

67. Discrimination is the opposite of association; it distinguishes what association tends to fuse.

68. The only things we discriminate are the things to which we attend.

69. We discriminate differences by the shock of transition between compared items.

70. Increasing familiarity increases discriminatory capacity; experts perceive differences invisible to novices.

71. Differences can be appreciated only when their terms are presented simultaneously or in immediate succession.

72. The perception of likeness is as primitive as the perception of difference; neither is more fundamental.

---

### Association

73. Association is the tendency of mental states to recall one another based on prior conjunction.

74. The laws of association (contiguity, similarity) are laws of the sequence of brain-states, not of ideas in abstraction.

75. Association by contiguity is the more elementary process; association by similarity is derivative.

76. No two ideas are associated merely by their nature as ideas; association always reflects past concrete experience.

77. Association works not through isolated ideas but through total brain-states; the entire mental context influences recall.

78. Voluntary recall involves active preparation, setting the mind in a direction that favors the emergence of the sought item.

---

### Time Perception

79. We perceive time directly; duration is a primary datum of consciousness, not an intellectual construction.

80. The specious present has a forward and backward fringe; we never perceive an instantaneous now.

81. The sense of pastness is a direct feeling accompanying reproduced images, not an inference.

82. Empty time is perceived as longer than filled time in the moment, but shorter in retrospect.

83. The estimation of short intervals depends on the number of events they contain.

84. Our sense of time's passage depends on the multiplicity and interest of our experiences.

---

### Memory

85. Memory proper involves not just the reappearance of an image but the localization of that image in the past.

86. The feeling of familiarity is a distinct psychic fact accompanying recognized objects.

87. Retention is fundamentally a brain-process; the persisting neural traces make recall possible.

88. Memory is not a general faculty but a collection of specific habits; improving memory means forming better associations.

89. The key to good memory is the formation of diverse and copious associations with the item to be remembered.

90. Recollection is a process of reconstruction; we work backward from associated facts to the target.

91. There is no single, undifferentiated faculty of memory that can be improved by formal exercise.

92. What we forget is what fails to connect with our organized system of associations.

---

### Sensation and Perception

93. Sensation and perception form a continuum; there is no sharp line between raw sensation and interpreted perception.

94. Pure sensation is an abstraction; all actual consciousness mingles sensation with memory and inference.

95. The intensity of a sensation is not a simple function of stimulus intensity; Weber's law describes the relationship.

96. Every sensation, however elementary, has an emotional coloring—a hedonic tone of pleasantness or unpleasantness.

97. The same stimulus may produce different sensations depending on the state of the organism.

98. Perception is shaped by expectation; we perceive what we anticipate, often overriding actual sensory input.

99. The perception of reality involves a vividness and cohesiveness that distinguish veridical experience from imagination.

100. All our sensations form an integrated totality; no sensation exists in isolation from the organism's total state.

### Sensation (The Senses)

1. Each sense organ yields a specific quality of sensation irreducible to any other; sensory qualities are ultimate, unanalyzable data.

2. The "specific energy" doctrine is correct: stimulation of a nerve always produces the same type of sensation regardless of how it is stimulated.

3. Sensations have no inherent spatial character in themselves; spatiality is contributed by the perceiving mind's synthesis.

4. The muscular sense (kinesthesis) is a distinct sensory system, not reducible to touch or any other sense.

5. Sensations of movement and position are as primary as sensations of color or sound.

6. Pain is not a specific sense modality but an affective quality that can accompany any sufficiently intense sensation.

7. The "sensation of innervation"—the feeling of outgoing motor commands—does not exist; all our knowledge of movement comes from afferent, not efferent, signals.

8. Pleasure and pain are not specific sensations but qualities that suffuse all experience to varying degrees.

9. Every sensation has a native volume or extensity, a primitive spatial character prior to localization.

10. The threshold of sensation varies with attention, adaptation, and the state of the organism.

---

### Imagination

11. Imagination differs from sensation only in degree of vividness, not in kind.

12. Mental images are not copies of sensations but schematic representations that omit most detail.

13. Individuals differ enormously in the vividness and type of their imagery; some think in pictures, others in words or abstract schemas.

14. The absence of vivid imagery does not impair abstract thought; many excellent thinkers lack strong visualization.

15. Imagination is reproductive—based on prior experience—but recombines elements in novel ways.

16. After-images and hallucinations differ from imagination in their involuntary character and apparent externality.

17. Thought can proceed without imagery; imageless thought is a genuine phenomenon.

18. The generic image—a composite representing a class—is a psychological myth; we think in particulars or in words.

---

### Perception of Space

19. Space perception is not innate in fully developed form but emerges from the synthesis of native spatial feelings.

20. Every sensation has an original extensity or voluminousness—a primitive, unlearned spatial quality.

21. The discrimination of spatial positions and forms is learned through movement and exploration.

22. The perception of a three-dimensional world from two-dimensional retinal images requires interpretation based on learned cues.

23. Binocular depth perception (stereopsis) is an original, unlearned spatial datum, not an inference.

24. The localization of sensations on the body surface (local sign) is partly innate, partly refined by experience.

25. Eye movements are essential to spatial perception; a paralyzed eye misperceives the location of objects.

26. The perception of size depends on the perceived distance of the object; the two are inseparably linked.

27. Optical illusions reveal the constructive, interpretive nature of space perception.

28. Touch and vision yield originally different spaces that must be correlated through experience.

29. The blind can develop sophisticated spatial understanding through touch and movement, demonstrating vision's non-necessity for spatial cognition.

30. Our perception of the vertical depends on multiple cues: visual, vestibular, tactile, and kinesthetic.

---

### The Perception of Reality

31. The sense of reality is a feeling, not a judgment; we feel some objects as real and others as unreal before any reasoning.

32. Whatever excites emotion, stimulates action, or coheres with our dominant interests feels real.

33. There are multiple "sub-universes" or worlds of reality: the world of sense, of science, of abstract truth, of illusion, of myth.

34. Each sub-universe has its own internal coherence and its own standard of reality.

35. The paramount reality for common sense is the world of physical objects in space and time.

36. For something to be believed, it must not contradict the objects of our paramount reality.

37. Belief and disbelief are not opposites of equal weight; disbelief requires an active effort of rejection.

38. The original, default attitude toward any mental content is acceptance; doubt is secondary and derivative.

39. Emotion is a stronger ground of belief than evidence; what we wish to be true feels more real.

40. Hallucinations feel real because they possess the vividness and coherence that mark sensory experience.

41. The perception of an object as real always involves its connection to a wider context of acknowledged realities.

---

### Reasoning

42. Reasoning is the extraction of abstract characters from concrete facts and the perception of their implications.

43. The essence of a thing is relative to our purpose; there is no "essential" essence independent of practical interest.

44. Sagacity—the talent for perceiving which aspect of a situation is relevant—is the heart of reasoning ability.

45. The reasoner's talent is the ability to see what is not obvious, to pick out the character that solves the problem.

46. All reasoning terminates in sensible particulars; conclusions must ultimately be verified in experience.

47. The difference between brute and human is the ability to dissociate attributes and attend to them separately.

48. Concepts are teleological weapons; we form them to handle reality, not to mirror it.

49. Resemblance is not an elementary mental function; we perceive similar objects as similar because of shared abstract characters.

50. Induction is reasoning from particular to particular via an extracted general character.

51. The principles of logic are not a priori truths but postulates accepted because of their utility.

---

### The Production of Movement

52. All consciousness is motor in its consequences; every mental state tends toward bodily expression.

53. Ideo-motor action is the type case: an idea of movement, unobstructed, directly produces that movement.

54. No special faculty of will is needed to explain voluntary action; the idea of the act is sufficient.

55. Movement follows thought unless an inhibiting idea intervenes.

56. The feelings of effort in movement are afferent, arising from the moving parts, not efferent commands.

57. Reaction time experiments reveal the temporal structure of mental processes.

58. The variety of human movements is not innately given but acquired through practice.

59. Complex coordinated movements become automatic through repetition, freeing attention for higher purposes.

---

### Instinct

60. Instincts are innate tendencies to act in specific ways when confronted with specific objects or situations.

61. Humans have more instincts than other animals, not fewer; our behavior is not less but more instinctively grounded.

62. Instincts are transitory; many appear at a certain developmental stage and then fade if not exercised.

63. Instincts can be inhibited by habit, by contrary instincts, or by reason.

64. The same object can trigger multiple, even contradictory instincts simultaneously (e.g., fear and curiosity).

65. Instincts are blind at first; the animal does not foresee the end until experience teaches the connection.

66. Human instincts include: sucking, biting, clasping, crying, locomotion, vocalization, imitation, emulation, pugnacity, sympathy, hunting, fear, acquisitiveness, constructiveness, play, curiosity, sociability, secretiveness, cleanliness, modesty, love, jealousy, and parental feeling.

67. Instinct and reason are not opposed; reason develops out of instinctive tendencies and modifies them.

68. The plasticity of human instinct, its susceptibility to modification by experience, is what makes learning possible.

---

### The Emotions

69. Emotion is the feeling of bodily changes as they occur; we do not cry because we are sad, we are sad because we cry (James-Lange theory).

70. The bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact; the feeling of these changes is the emotion.

71. Without bodily reverberation, the perception of an exciting object would be purely cognitive, devoid of emotional warmth.

72. Different emotions involve different patterns of bodily change; each emotion has its characteristic physiological signature.

73. The coarser emotions (fear, rage, grief) are more obviously tied to bodily disturbance; the subtler ones less so.

74. Emotional expression can produce or intensify the corresponding emotion; acting angry makes us angrier.

75. Voluntary control of emotional expression provides indirect control over the emotion itself.

76. Aesthetic emotions are as genuinely somatic as cruder emotions, though their bodily component is subtler.

77. The emotion is not an effect of the bodily change but is constituted by the perception of that change.

78. Suppress all bodily manifestation, and an emotion disappears; what remains is mere intellectual perception.

---

### Will

79. Volition is primarily a relation between the self and its ideas, not between the self and bodily movements.

80. The essential achievement of will is attending to a difficult idea and holding it fast before the mind.

81. Voluntary action is ideo-motor action preceded by a fiat, a consent to the idea's realization.

82. Effort of will is essentially effort of attention; we will by keeping our mind on the right object.

83. The sense of effort arises when we must sustain attention against competing ideas that would distract us.

84. Desire and will are distinct; we can desire what we do not will and will what we do not desire.

85. There is no separate faculty of will; will is simply the relating of the self to its ideas.

86. In will, the self identifies with one idea and disowns others; volition is the acceptance of an idea as "mine."

87. The question of free will is ultimately metaphysical; psychology can only describe the phenomena of choosing.

88. The feeling of freedom is a datum of consciousness; whether this feeling corresponds to metaphysical reality is another question.

89. Healthy will operates smoothly without excessive deliberation; morbid will is paralyzed by indecision.

90. The drunkard's struggle illustrates the will: he must keep the idea of sobriety before his mind against the alluring idea of drink.

91. Moral action involves preferring a more remote, abstract good over an immediate, vivid pleasure.

92. The effort required in willing varies with temperament; some find sustained attention easy, others nearly impossible.

---

### Hypnotism and Dissociation

93. Hypnotic phenomena are genuine psychological facts, not fraud or mere compliance.

94. Hypnosis reveals the dissociability of mental functions normally integrated in waking life.

95. Post-hypnotic suggestion demonstrates that ideas can operate unconsciously to produce behavior.

96. The hypnotic subject's consciousness is narrowed, not abolished; attention is concentrated and distractibility reduced.

97. Secondary personalities in hysteria and dissociative states are genuine organizations of experience, not simulations.

98. The unity of consciousness is not an indissoluble given but an achievement that can break down.

99. Dissociation demonstrates that the self is not a metaphysical unity but a functional synthesis that can be disrupted.

100. The phenomena of hypnotism and automatism reveal mental processes occurring outside the field of personal awareness.

## 100 Philosophical/Psychological Positions

---

### Sensation (The Senses)

1. Each sense organ yields a specific quality of sensation irreducible to any other; sensory qualities are ultimate, unanalyzable data.

2. The "specific energy" doctrine is correct: stimulation of a nerve always produces the same type of sensation regardless of how it is stimulated.

3. Sensations have no inherent spatial character in themselves; spatiality is contributed by the perceiving mind's synthesis.

4. The muscular sense (kinesthesis) is a distinct sensory system, not reducible to touch or any other sense.

5. Sensations of movement and position are as primary as sensations of color or sound.

6. Pain is not a specific sense modality but an affective quality that can accompany any sufficiently intense sensation.

7. The "sensation of innervation"—the feeling of outgoing motor commands—does not exist; all our knowledge of movement comes from afferent, not efferent, signals.

8. Pleasure and pain are not specific sensations but qualities that suffuse all experience to varying degrees.

9. Every sensation has a native volume or extensity, a primitive spatial character prior to localization.

10. The threshold of sensation varies with attention, adaptation, and the state of the organism.

---

### Imagination

11. Imagination differs from sensation only in degree of vividness, not in kind.

12. Mental images are not copies of sensations but schematic representations that omit most detail.

13. Individuals differ enormously in the vividness and type of their imagery; some think in pictures, others in words or abstract schemas.

14. The absence of vivid imagery does not impair abstract thought; many excellent thinkers lack strong visualization.

15. Imagination is reproductive—based on prior experience—but recombines elements in novel ways.

16. After-images and hallucinations differ from imagination in their involuntary character and apparent externality.

17. Thought can proceed without imagery; imageless thought is a genuine phenomenon.

18. The generic image—a composite representing a class—is a psychological myth; we think in particulars or in words.

---

### Perception of Space

19. Space perception is not innate in fully developed form but emerges from the synthesis of native spatial feelings.

20. Every sensation has an original extensity or voluminousness—a primitive, unlearned spatial quality.

21. The discrimination of spatial positions and forms is learned through movement and exploration.

22. The perception of a three-dimensional world from two-dimensional retinal images requires interpretation based on learned cues.

23. Binocular depth perception (stereopsis) is an original, unlearned spatial datum, not an inference.

24. The localization of sensations on the body surface (local sign) is partly innate, partly refined by experience.

25. Eye movements are essential to spatial perception; a paralyzed eye misperceives the location of objects.

26. The perception of size depends on the perceived distance of the object; the two are inseparably linked.

27. Optical illusions reveal the constructive, interpretive nature of space perception.

28. Touch and vision yield originally different spaces that must be correlated through experience.

29. The blind can develop sophisticated spatial understanding through touch and movement, demonstrating vision's non-necessity for spatial cognition.

30. Our perception of the vertical depends on multiple cues: visual, vestibular, tactile, and kinesthetic.

---

### The Perception of Reality

31. The sense of reality is a feeling, not a judgment; we feel some objects as real and others as unreal before any reasoning.

32. Whatever excites emotion, stimulates action, or coheres with our dominant interests feels real.

33. There are multiple "sub-universes" or worlds of reality: the world of sense, of science, of abstract truth, of illusion, of myth.

34. Each sub-universe has its own internal coherence and its own standard of reality.

35. The paramount reality for common sense is the world of physical objects in space and time.

36. For something to be believed, it must not contradict the objects of our paramount reality.

37. Belief and disbelief are not opposites of equal weight; disbelief requires an active effort of rejection.

38. The original, default attitude toward any mental content is acceptance; doubt is secondary and derivative.

39. Emotion is a stronger ground of belief than evidence; what we wish to be true feels more real.

40. Hallucinations feel real because they possess the vividness and coherence that mark sensory experience.

41. The perception of an object as real always involves its connection to a wider context of acknowledged realities.

---

### Reasoning

42. Reasoning is the extraction of abstract characters from concrete facts and the perception of their implications.

43. The essence of a thing is relative to our purpose; there is no "essential" essence independent of practical interest.

44. Sagacity—the talent for perceiving which aspect of a situation is relevant—is the heart of reasoning ability.

45. The reasoner's talent is the ability to see what is not obvious, to pick out the character that solves the problem.

46. All reasoning terminates in sensible particulars; conclusions must ultimately be verified in experience.

47. The difference between brute and human is the ability to dissociate attributes and attend to them separately.

48. Concepts are teleological weapons; we form them to handle reality, not to mirror it.

49. Resemblance is not an elementary mental function; we perceive similar objects as similar because of shared abstract characters.

50. Induction is reasoning from particular to particular via an extracted general character.

51. The principles of logic are not a priori truths but postulates accepted because of their utility.

---

### The Production of Movement

52. All consciousness is motor in its consequences; every mental state tends toward bodily expression.

53. Ideo-motor action is the type case: an idea of movement, unobstructed, directly produces that movement.

54. No special faculty of will is needed to explain voluntary action; the idea of the act is sufficient.

55. Movement follows thought unless an inhibiting idea intervenes.

56. The feelings of effort in movement are afferent, arising from the moving parts, not efferent commands.

57. Reaction time experiments reveal the temporal structure of mental processes.

58. The variety of human movements is not innately given but acquired through practice.

59. Complex coordinated movements become automatic through repetition, freeing attention for higher purposes.

---

### Instinct

60. Instincts are innate tendencies to act in specific ways when confronted with specific objects or situations.

61. Humans have more instincts than other animals, not fewer; our behavior is not less but more instinctively grounded.

62. Instincts are transitory; many appear at a certain developmental stage and then fade if not exercised.

63. Instincts can be inhibited by habit, by contrary instincts, or by reason.

64. The same object can trigger multiple, even contradictory instincts simultaneously (e.g., fear and curiosity).

65. Instincts are blind at first; the animal does not foresee the end until experience teaches the connection.

66. Human instincts include: sucking, biting, clasping, crying, locomotion, vocalization, imitation, emulation, pugnacity, sympathy, hunting, fear, acquisitiveness, constructiveness, play, curiosity, sociability, secretiveness, cleanliness, modesty, love, jealousy, and parental feeling.

67. Instinct and reason are not opposed; reason develops out of instinctive tendencies and modifies them.

68. The plasticity of human instinct, its susceptibility to modification by experience, is what makes learning possible.

---

### The Emotions

69. Emotion is the feeling of bodily changes as they occur; we do not cry because we are sad, we are sad because we cry (James-Lange theory).

70. The bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact; the feeling of these changes is the emotion.

71. Without bodily reverberation, the perception of an exciting object would be purely cognitive, devoid of emotional warmth.

72. Different emotions involve different patterns of bodily change; each emotion has its characteristic physiological signature.

73. The coarser emotions (fear, rage, grief) are more obviously tied to bodily disturbance; the subtler ones less so.

74. Emotional expression can produce or intensify the corresponding emotion; acting angry makes us angrier.

75. Voluntary control of emotional expression provides indirect control over the emotion itself.

76. Aesthetic emotions are as genuinely somatic as cruder emotions, though their bodily component is subtler.

77. The emotion is not an effect of the bodily change but is constituted by the perception of that change.

78. Suppress all bodily manifestation, and an emotion disappears; what remains is mere intellectual perception.

---

### Will

79. Volition is primarily a relation between the self and its ideas, not between the self and bodily movements.

80. The essential achievement of will is attending to a difficult idea and holding it fast before the mind.

81. Voluntary action is ideo-motor action preceded by a fiat, a consent to the idea's realization.

82. Effort of will is essentially effort of attention; we will by keeping our mind on the right object.

83. The sense of effort arises when we must sustain attention against competing ideas that would distract us.

84. Desire and will are distinct; we can desire what we do not will and will what we do not desire.

85. There is no separate faculty of will; will is simply the relating of the self to its ideas.

86. In will, the self identifies with one idea and disowns others; volition is the acceptance of an idea as "mine."

87. The question of free will is ultimately metaphysical; psychology can only describe the phenomena of choosing.

88. The feeling of freedom is a datum of consciousness; whether this feeling corresponds to metaphysical reality is another question.

89. Healthy will operates smoothly without excessive deliberation; morbid will is paralyzed by indecision.

90. The drunkard's struggle illustrates the will: he must keep the idea of sobriety before his mind against the alluring idea of drink.

91. Moral action involves preferring a more remote, abstract good over an immediate, vivid pleasure.

92. The effort required in willing varies with temperament; some find sustained attention easy, others nearly impossible.

---

### Hypnotism and Dissociation

93. Hypnotic phenomena are genuine psychological facts, not fraud or mere compliance.

94. Hypnosis reveals the dissociability of mental functions normally integrated in waking life.

95. Post-hypnotic suggestion demonstrates that ideas can operate unconsciously to produce behavior.

96. The hypnotic subject's consciousness is narrowed, not abolished; attention is concentrated and distractibility reduced.

97. Secondary personalities in hysteria and dissociative states are genuine organizations of experience, not simulations.

98. The unity of consciousness is not an indissoluble given but an achievement that can break down.

99. Dissociation demonstrates that the self is not a metaphysical unity but a functional synthesis that can be disrupted.

100. The phenomena of hypnotism and automatism reveal mental processes occurring outside the field of personal awareness.

The Varieties of Religious Experience

1. Religion is the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.
2. The divine is such a primal reality as the individual feels impelled to respond to solemnly and gravely.
