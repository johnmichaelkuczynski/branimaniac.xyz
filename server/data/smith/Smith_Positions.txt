# 100 Additional Position Statements from Adam Smith's *Theory of Moral Sentiments*

## The Love of Praise vs. Praiseworthiness

101. The desire to be praised and the desire to be praiseworthy are distinct sentiments that often conflict.

102. The love of praiseworthiness—the desire to deserve approval—is the nobler sentiment and the foundation of genuine virtue.

103. The mere love of praise, without concern for deserving it, produces vanity and sycophancy.

104. We desire not only to be approved of but to be worthy of approval; the former without the latter brings no solid satisfaction.

105. The vain man is satisfied with unmerited praise; the proud man demands that praise correspond to actual merit.

106. Self-approbation—the approval of one's own conscience—is essential for happiness; external praise cannot substitute for it.

107. When external praise contradicts the verdict of the impartial spectator, the wise person trusts the internal judge.

108. Unmerited reproach is painful, but the person conscious of praiseworthiness can bear it with equanimity.

109. The man who seeks only praise becomes a servile flatterer of the opinions of others.

110. The man who seeks praiseworthiness remains independent, guided by principle rather than popularity.

## Custom and Fashion

111. Custom and fashion exert enormous influence over moral sentiments, often overriding natural judgment.

112. Different nations approve of different degrees of emotional expression because custom has habituated them differently.

113. What appears proper in one society may seem excessive or deficient in another due solely to habitual expectation.

114. Custom can sanctify practices that natural sentiment would otherwise condemn, such as infanticide in ancient societies.

115. Fashion extends the influence of the great beyond their proper sphere, making their tastes and manners objects of imitation.

116. Fashion sometimes renders even deformity agreeable by associating it with persons of rank.

117. Custom can never entirely pervert moral judgment; some practices remain condemned despite long custom.

118. The influence of custom explains much of the variation in moral codes across societies without implying moral relativism.

119. Fashion in morals is more dangerous than fashion in dress, as it corrupts fundamental judgments of propriety.

120. Philosophers must distinguish between what is naturally proper and what appears proper merely through custom.

## Self-Deception and Moral Psychology

121. Self-deceit is the fatal weakness from which half of human disorders arise.

122. We naturally view our own conduct through a flattering lens that obscures our faults.

123. The impartial spectator is difficult to consult honestly because self-love distorts our self-perception.

124. We rarely examine our own conduct with the same severity we apply to the conduct of others.

125. Distance in time aids moral self-examination: we judge our past selves more impartially than our present selves.

126. The eye sees everything but itself; similarly, we observe others' failings while remaining blind to our own.

127. Self-approbation, when based on self-deceit, provides only an unstable and counterfeit satisfaction.

128. The wise person cultivates habits of honest self-examination to counteract the natural tendency to self-flattery.

129. We construct narratives that cast ourselves as protagonists and overlook evidence that contradicts this image.

130. True virtue requires the painful discipline of seeing ourselves as others see us.

## Resentment, Revenge, and Punishment

131. Resentment is the great safeguard of justice, prompting resistance to injury.

132. Nature has implanted resentment to protect individuals from violation, but it requires restraint to be properly exercised.

133. Ungoverned resentment is the most odious of all the passions; it must be disciplined by the impartial spectator.

134. We sympathize with resentment only when it is moderated and directed at genuinely culpable offenses.

135. The desire for revenge must be distinguished from just indignation; the former seeks pain, the latter seeks justice.

136. Punishment should be proportioned not to the harm done but to the resentment an impartial spectator would feel.

137. Excessive punishment, even of the guilty, offends the moral sentiments and transforms sympathy to the offender.

138. The criminal who sincerely repents becomes an object of some degree of sympathy, even from those he injured.

139. Capital punishment for minor offenses corrupts moral sentiment by habituating society to disproportionate severity.

140. Private revenge undermines social order; proper resentment channels itself through public institutions.

## Shame, Guilt, and Remorse

141. Shame is the pain of being disapproved of by others; guilt is the pain of disapproving of oneself.

142. Remorse is the most dreadful of sentiments—the anguish of the impartial spectator condemning one's own conduct.

143. The man who has violated justice carries an internal torturer that poisons every pleasure.

144. Shame without guilt—distress at unmerited reproach—is painful but does not wound the conscience.

145. Guilt without shame—when vice escapes detection—still torments through the impartial spectator's condemnation.

146. The criminal dreads not merely punishment but the just contempt of mankind.

147. Confession of wrongdoing, though painful, brings relief by aligning external judgment with internal condemnation.

148. The desire for concealment of guilt shows that the offender's own conscience condemns the action.

149. Remorse seeks atonement; it naturally prompts reparation and reformation of conduct.

150. The most hardened villain cannot entirely silence the voice of conscience, though he may deafen himself to it.

## Death and the Dread of Dissolution

151. We sympathize with the dead, imagining ourselves in that condition of darkness and dissolution.

152. This imaginative sympathy with the dead, though founded on illusion, produces some of our most powerful sentiments.

153. The dead feel nothing, yet we project onto them our horror of their condition.

154. The dread of death derives not from concern for the cessation of sensation but from imagining ourselves conscious of being dead.

155. Fear of death is disproportionate to any actual evil it contains; it is an illusion of the sympathetic imagination.

156. This dread of death serves nature's purposes by making us vigilant for self-preservation.

157. The Stoic attempt to treat death as indifferent is contrary to natural sentiment, though philosophically defensible.

158. Grief for the dead is natural, but excessive grief implies a failure of self-command.

159. The pompous ceremonies of death—tombs, monuments—testify to our imaginative projection onto the deceased.

160. The desire for posthumous fame reflects our illusion that the dead somehow enjoy the approbation of the living.

## The Stoic Philosophy

161. The Stoics correctly identified the importance of self-command as central to virtue.

162. The Stoic doctrine that the wise man is happy even under torture is extravagant but contains a kernel of truth.

163. Stoic apathy—complete extirpation of passion—is neither possible nor desirable; moderation, not elimination, is the goal.

164. The Stoics erred in treating all failures of virtue as equally culpable; there are degrees of vice.

165. The Stoic system rightly emphasizes that external goods cannot guarantee happiness.

166. Stoic physics—the doctrine of universal providence—supports their ethical teaching but requires faith in benevolent nature.

167. The Stoic conception of living according to nature is valuable if properly understood.

168. Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus represent the most admirable expression of Stoic virtue in practice.

169. The Stoic insistence on the unity of virtue is too rigid; the virtues are distinct, though related.

170. Stoic resignation in the face of fortune is admirable, but their indifference to natural goods is excessive.

## Other Philosophical Systems

171. Plato correctly identified the tripartite nature of the soul: reason, spirit, and appetite.

172. Aristotle rightly placed virtue in a mean between excess and deficiency.

173. Epicurus erred in reducing all motivation to pleasure and pain, overlooking sympathy's independent role.

174. Mandeville's system—reducing all virtue to disguised self-love—is fundamentally mistaken and morally pernicious.

175. Hutcheson correctly identified a moral sense but erred in making benevolence the sole virtue.

176. Systems that ground morality entirely in reason neglect the essential role of sentiment.

177. Systems that ground morality entirely in sentiment neglect reason's role in formulating general rules.

178. The selfish systems (Hobbes, Mandeville) cannot explain the reality of genuine sympathy and disinterested approbation.

179. Casuistry failed because it sought mathematical precision in a domain requiring judgment.

180. No philosophical system has perfectly captured morality, but each illuminates some aspect of moral life.

## The Amiable and Respectable Virtues

181. The amiable virtues—humanity, compassion, gentleness—consist in the exquisite sensibility of the agent.

182. The respectable virtues—self-command, fortitude, magnanimity—consist in the subjection of passion to propriety.

183. The amiable virtues prompt us to enter into the feelings of others with tenderness.

184. The respectable virtues prompt us to moderate our own feelings to what others can enter into.

185. Complete virtue requires both sensibility (to feel for others) and self-command (to govern oneself).

186. The amiable virtues are more engaging; the respectable virtues are more commanding.

187. Women, by custom and situation, have traditionally cultivated the amiable virtues more; men, the respectable.

188. The soft virtues without self-command become weakness; the hard virtues without sensibility become harshness.

189. The person of perfect virtue balances tenderness with firmness, sympathy with self-government.

190. Neither sensibility nor self-command alone constitutes moral excellence; their union does.

## The Social Origins of Morality

191. Morality is inconceivable outside society; the isolated individual could form no moral judgments.

192. The impartial spectator is an internalized social perspective, not an innate faculty.

193. We learn to judge ourselves by first judging others and then applying that standard reflexively.

194. The child develops conscience through repeated experience of others' approval and disapproval.

195. Moral concepts are social creations, formed through the commerce of sentiments in society.

196. The looking-glass of society shows us our own character; without it, we could not see ourselves.

197. Even the most isolated hermit carries within him an impartial spectator formed through earlier social experience.

198. Language itself—the vehicle of moral concepts—is inherently social and shapes moral thought.

199. Different social conditions produce different emphases in moral development, though core principles remain constant.

200. Commercial society cultivates certain virtues (honesty, punctuality) while potentially weakening others (martial courage).

## Religion and Morality

201. Belief in a future state of rewards and punishments supports but does not constitute morality.

202. The sense of duty would remain even without religious belief, though religion reinforces it.

203. The natural order of the universe, despite apparent injustices, tends toward the rewarding of virtue.

204. The Author of nature has designed human sentiments to promote social harmony and individual welfare.

205. Religious doctrines that promise forgiveness without reformation corrupt moral sentiment.

206. True piety is consistent with attention to the ordinary duties of life, not a replacement for them.

207. The superstitious person attends to ritual while neglecting justice; this inverts the moral order.

208. The all-seeing Judge provides an ultimate tribunal before which no self-deception can prevail.

209. Religious fanaticism perverts natural morality by commanding violations of justice in the name of faith.

210. The belief that the universe is ultimately just, though not demonstrable, is a natural sentiment supporting virtue.

## The Administration of the Universe

211. Nature appears to have constituted things to promote the happiness of mankind in general.

212. The invisible hand coordinates individual self-interest toward collective welfare without conscious design.

213. The distribution of the means of happiness is more equal than the distribution of wealth suggests.

214. The rich, despite their selfishness, are led to distribute necessities through employing the poor.

215. The deception of imagination—making us overvalue wealth—serves nature's purpose of motivating industry.

216. Every individual, pursuing his own interest, frequently promotes the interest of society more effectually than when intending to promote it.

217. The wisdom of nature appears in the adaptation of sentiments to their proper purposes.

218. The final cause of moral sentiments is the preservation and welfare of the species.

219. Apparent disorders in moral life, like irregular judgments based on fortune, serve hidden purposes.

220. The whole machine of the world is designed to promote universal happiness, though we cannot see all its workings.

## The Corruption of Moral Sentiments

221. The disposition to admire the rich and neglect the poor is the chief cause of moral corruption.

222. The conflation of wealth with wisdom and virtue perverts the natural order of moral approbation.

223. Courts and palaces are the worst schools of morality; cottages are often better.

224. The great are surrounded by flatterers who confirm their self-deception.

225. Success in the world requires not virtue but the appearance of virtue—a dangerous substitution.

226. Fashion can make vice fashionable and virtue appear unfashionable, corrupting youth.

227. The poor man's modesty and the rich man's arrogance both result from corrupted moral sentiment.

228. Ambition, unchecked by conscience, produces crimes that merely selfish motives would never prompt.

229. The corruption of moral sentiments is most dangerous when it is systematic and socially sanctioned.

230. Only the wise and virtuous resist the corruption that pervades the moral sentiments of the vulgar.

## National Character and Morals

231. Different nations develop different national characters through climate, government, and circumstances.

232. Commercial nations tend toward softness; warlike nations toward hardness of character.

233. The morals of a nation reflect its form of government as much as its government reflects its morals.

234. Republics tend to produce independent, public-spirited characters; despotisms produce servility.

235. The manners of the great set the tone for the nation; their corruption spreads downward.

236. National pride, within limits, is a virtue that supports patriotic duty.

237. Excessive national vanity blinds a people to their faults and prevents improvement.

238. The prejudice that one's own nation is superior to all others is natural but should be corrected by philosophy.

239. Every nation believes its own customs most rational; this is mere prejudice.

240. Cosmopolitan virtue—concern for all mankind—is compatible with special duties to one's own country.

## Gratitude and Beneficence

241. Gratitude is a debt that must be paid but cannot be extorted; it must be voluntary.

242. The ungrateful person is detested because he violates one of the most sacred duties.

243. Excessive gratitude—giving more than the benefit received—is admired rather than blamed.

244. We owe gratitude not in proportion to the cost to the benefactor but to the benefit received.

245. Gratitude to the dead—honoring benefactors who can no longer benefit us—reveals disinterested virtue.

246. Even unintentional benefits create some claim to gratitude, though less than intentional ones.

247. The order of beneficence follows the order of affection: family, friends, country, mankind.

248. Beneficence to strangers at the expense of one's own family is a perversion of natural duty.

249. The impartial spectator approves of partial affections because they are natural and effective.

250. Universal benevolence, though noble, lacks the motivational force of particular attachments.

## Conscience and Moral Authority

251. Conscience speaks with an authority that no earthly tribunal possesses.

252. The judgment of conscience, when uncorrupted, is infallible in its own sphere.

253. We may silence conscience by distraction, but we cannot ultimately convince it against its verdict.

254. The man at ease with his conscience enjoys a tranquility no external success can provide.

255. Conscience connects the individual to a moral order transcending his particular interests.

256. The verdicts of conscience feel categorical—absolutely binding, not merely advisable.

257. Conscience punishes and rewards immediately, without waiting for external consequences.

258. A bad conscience anticipates punishment; a good conscience anticipates reward, even if delayed until death.

259. The authority of conscience derives from the impartial spectator within, not from fear of punishment.

260. To violate conscience for any worldly advantage is to sell one's soul.

## Moral Education and Development

261. The moral sentiments are natural but require development through social experience.

262. Children learn virtue initially through imitation and habituation, not through reasoning.

263. Early discipline forms habits of self-command that reason alone could not produce.

264. The praise and blame of caregivers first awakens the child to the reality of moral judgment.

265. Education should cultivate both sensibility and self-command, the two pillars of virtue.

266. Literary education refines moral sentiment by extending imaginative sympathy.

267. The study of history provides examples of virtue and vice for moral reflection.

268. Moral philosophy is useful for formulating general rules, but virtue is learned through practice.

269. The company one keeps shapes moral character more than explicit instruction.

270. Travel and exposure to other nations corrects provincial prejudice and refines moral judgment.

## Intentions, Actions, and Consequences

271. We judge intentions more leniently when consequences are favorable, more harshly when unfavorable.

272. This influence of consequences on moral judgment is a natural irregularity in human sentiment.

273. Strict justice would judge by intention alone; natural sentiment cannot help attending to outcome.

274. The attempt that fails is judged less harshly than the attempt that succeeds, though the intention was identical.

275. Nature has arranged this irregularity to encourage beneficial action and discourage harmful action.

276. The negligent person who accidentally causes harm feels guilt disproportionate to moral fault.

277. The careful person whose precautions accidentally fail feels undeserved remorse.

278. This imperfect correspondence between intention and judgment is humanly ineradicable.

279. Legal systems attempt to judge by intention, but even they cannot wholly ignore consequence.

280. The full moral assessment of an action requires attention to motive, intention, action, and consequence.

## Self-Interest and Social Harmony

281. Self-preservation and the pursuit of one's own welfare are natural and proper.

282. The selfish passions are not inherently vicious; they become vicious only in excess.

283. Prudent attention to one's own interests is a virtue, not a vice.

284. The accusation that all virtue is disguised self-love fundamentally misunderstands human nature.

285. We are naturally constituted to find satisfaction in the welfare of others, not only our own.

286. Social harmony arises from the natural correspondence of sentiments, not from calculation of advantage.

287. Trust, essential for commerce and society, depends on justice, which is not reducible to self-interest.

288. Even the most self-interested person depends on the good opinion of others and must attend to their sentiments.

289. Self-interest, properly understood, includes the social ties and affections that partly constitute the self.

290. The apparent conflict between self-interest and social welfare is largely an illusion; they mostly coincide.

## Propriety in Expression

291. Every passion has a proper expression that fits its exciting cause; propriety consists in this fitness.

292. We judge expression not by its intensity but by its appropriateness to the occasion.

293. Grief for trivial losses appears ridiculous; composure under genuine tragedy appears unfeeling.

294. The propriety of expression varies with circumstance: what is proper in private may be improper in public.

295. Persons of equal rank may express sentiments to each other that would be improper between persons of unequal rank.

296. The degree of intimacy determines what expressions of feeling are appropriate.

297. What may be expressed to a friend may not be expressed to a stranger.

298. The wise person adjusts expression to audience without becoming a mere chameleon.

299. Excessive restraint of natural feeling can be as improper as excessive expression.

300. The propriety of expression is learned through social experience and refined by reflection.

This second set goes deeper into Smith's moral psychology, his engagement with other philosophical systems, and his analysis of social dynamics. Want me to continue with a third set focusing on any particular themes?

# 100 Position Statements from Adam Smith's *Theory of Moral Sentiments*

## Sympathy and Fellow-Feeling

1. Human beings naturally take an interest in the fortunes of others, regardless of any personal advantage derived from their well-being.

2. Sympathy arises not from direct observation of another's emotions but from imaginatively placing ourselves in their situation.

3. We cannot directly experience another person's sensations; we can only form a conception of them through imagination.

4. The pleasure of mutual sympathy—knowing that another shares our feelings—is itself a distinct and significant source of satisfaction.

5. We derive comfort not merely from sympathetic sentiment itself but from perceiving agreement or correspondence between our feelings and those of others.

6. Sympathy with sorrow is generally stronger and more universal than sympathy with joy.

7. We more readily sympathize with small joys than with great ones, as excessive fortune provokes envy.

8. Complete sympathy—perfect correspondence of sentiments—is never actually achieved between persons; approximation is the best we attain.

9. The source of our sympathy is not the passion we observe in another but the situation that excites that passion.

10. We sometimes sympathize with emotions a person ought to feel even when they do not actually feel them.

## The Impartial Spectator

11. Moral judgment operates through an imagined impartial spectator who observes our conduct from a disinterested perspective.

12. The impartial spectator is an internalized judge, formed through social experience, that enables self-evaluation.

13. We judge our own conduct by imagining how an informed, fair-minded third party would view it.

14. Conscience is the voice of the impartial spectator within us, pronouncing judgment on our actions.

15. The man within the breast—our internal monitor—provides a more reliable moral tribunal than actual spectators.

16. Actual spectators are often partial, ignorant of circumstances, or swayed by self-interest; the impartial spectator corrects these deficiencies.

17. Moral self-approval consists in the imagined approbation of the impartial spectator toward our conduct.

18. The impartial spectator judges not only our actions but also our motives and intentions.

19. We cannot be satisfied with our own conduct merely because others approve of it; we require the approval of the impartial spectator.

20. The impartial spectator's judgment sometimes conflicts with popular opinion, and in such cases, the wise person follows the former.

## Propriety and Merit

21. The propriety of an action consists in the suitability or appropriateness of the affection that prompts it to its exciting cause.

22. Merit and demerit concern the effects of actions and the gratitude or resentment they naturally provoke.

23. An action is meritorious when it is the proper object of gratitude; it is demeritorious when it is the proper object of resentment.

24. Propriety and merit are distinct moral categories: an action may be proper without being meritorious and vice versa.

25. The sense of propriety derives from sympathy with the agent's motives; the sense of merit derives from sympathy with the recipient's gratitude.

26. We approve of punishment because we sympathize with the resentment of the injured party.

27. Resentment is the passion that prompts us to retaliate for injury; gratitude prompts us to reward beneficence.

28. Just resentment—resentment that the impartial spectator can enter into—is the proper foundation for punishment.

29. The merit of an action depends partly on the intention behind it, not solely on its consequences.

30. Accidental harms, though they may produce suffering, do not properly excite resentment because no malevolent intention was present.

## The Passions

31. The passions originating from the body (hunger, pain, sexual desire) excite little sympathy in spectators because others cannot imaginatively enter into physical states.

32. Passions arising from imagination (love, ambition, resentment) more readily excite sympathy because spectators can share the mental conception that produces them.

33. Excessive expression of any passion alienates sympathy; moderation in expression is necessary for fellow-feeling.

34. The unsocial passions—hatred, resentment, anger—excite a divided sympathy: we partly sympathize with the agent but also with the object of these passions.

35. The social passions—generosity, humanity, kindness—excite redoubled sympathy: we sympathize both with the agent and with the recipient.

36. The selfish passions—grief, joy regarding personal fortune—occupy a middle ground, exciting moderate sympathy.

37. We demand greater moderation in the expression of selfish passions than in the expression of social ones.

38. Grief, unless moderated, fatigues and disgusts spectators rather than exciting their sympathy.

39. The expression of resentment requires the greatest restraint of all passions to be sympathized with.

40. We admire the person who maintains composure under provocation more than one who gives way to passion.

## Self-Command and Virtue

41. Self-command—the ability to restrain passion and moderate conduct—is the foundation of all the other virtues.

42. The virtue of self-command consists in bringing our passions to the level that the impartial spectator can approve.

43. Different societies cultivate different degrees of self-command, but some measure of it is universally admired.

44. Savage nations cultivate a severe self-command because their conditions of life require it.

45. Civilized nations develop a more moderate, polished self-command suited to commercial society.

46. The man of real constancy and firmness maintains equanimity not through insensibility but through self-mastery.

47. True magnanimity consists not in the absence of passion but in the governance of passion by reason and the impartial spectator.

48. Prudence, justice, and beneficence are the three principal virtues directing our conduct toward ourselves and others.

49. Prudence regarding one's own welfare is a respectable virtue, though not the most ennobling one.

50. The prudent man pursues security and modest prosperity through steady application rather than risky ventures.

## Justice

51. Justice is a negative virtue: it consists primarily in abstaining from injury to others rather than in positive beneficence.

52. The rules of justice are the only moral rules that are precise and accurate like rules of grammar.

53. Justice may be extorted by force; beneficence cannot be.

54. Society can subsist without beneficence, though in a disagreeable state; it cannot subsist at all without justice.

55. Justice is the main pillar that upholds the social edifice; if removed, the structure crumbles.

56. Resentment against injustice is not merely natural but proper and necessary for the maintenance of society.

57. Punishment for injustice requires no positive beneficence from the punisher; it is a negative response to a negative act.

58. The rules of justice are not derived from reason or utility alone but from the natural sentiments of resentment and approbation.

59. We feel guilty for unjust acts even when they benefit us, because the impartial spectator within condemns them.

60. Commutative justice—abstaining from what belongs to others—is more determinate than distributive justice.

## Beneficence

61. Beneficence is a positive virtue that cannot be coerced; it must be free to be truly meritorious.

62. We are more obligated to beneficence toward those close to us: family, friends, countrymen.

63. The order of beneficence follows natural affection: we owe most to those with whom we are most connected.

64. Universal benevolence toward all mankind, though noble in conception, is too weak to motivate effective action.

65. The wise and virtuous person cultivates particular attachments, which are the natural sources of beneficent action.

66. Beneficence that exceeds what the situation calls for becomes ostentation rather than virtue.

67. The most beneficent actions are those that cost the agent something; easy generosity commands less admiration.

68. Gratitude for beneficence received is a duty, though not one enforceable by punishment.

69. Ingratitude is one of the most odious vices because it violates the natural sentiment of return for kindness.

70. The neglect of beneficence, though not punishable, exposes one to general disapprobation.

## Fortune and Moral Judgment

71. Our moral judgments are irregularly influenced by the actual consequences of actions, though these consequences are often beyond the agent's control.

72. We tend to judge unsuccessful good intentions less favorably than successful ones, though the intention was identical.

73. This irregularity of sentiment—judging by outcome rather than intention—is a deviation from strict propriety but serves a social purpose.

74. Nature has implanted this tendency to judge by consequences to encourage useful actions and discourage harmful ones.

75. The person whose good intentions miscarry feels a kind of guilt, though strict justice would not impute any fault.

76. Conversely, the person whose rash action accidentally produces good feels a kind of merit they do not strictly deserve.

77. The distress we feel for unintended harm is the foundation of superstitious rituals of expiation found in all societies.

78. Moral luck—the influence of fortune on moral judgment—is an imperfection in our nature that we can recognize but not entirely eliminate.

## Rank, Wealth, and Admiration

79. Mankind naturally admires the rich and powerful and tends to neglect the poor and obscure.

80. This disposition to admire the wealthy corrupts moral sentiments by conflating external success with virtue.

81. The great mob of mankind are the admirers of wealth and greatness; philosophers alone consistently distinguish these from wisdom and virtue.

82. Ambition arises largely from the desire to be observed, attended to, and regarded with admiration.

83. The poor man's son, whom heaven has cursed with ambition, pursues wealth imagining it will bring happiness, but discovers this is an illusion.

84. Yet this deception—the overestimation of the pleasures of wealth—is useful, as it spurs industry and progress.

85. The distinction of ranks and the order of society depend partly on our natural disposition to admire the great.

86. Two paths to admiration exist: the acquisition of wealth and greatness, or the attainment of wisdom and virtue.

87. The path of virtue is more secure and stable; the path of wealth is more dazzling but precarious.

88. Fashion extends the authority of the great even to matters of taste and opinion, where it has no proper jurisdiction.

89. Sycophancy toward the great is one of the corruptions of moral sentiment most dangerous to societies.

90. True dignity consists not in external rank but in the propriety of conduct that merits the impartial spectator's approval.

## Moral Rules and Systems

91. General moral rules are formed by induction from particular judgments of the impartial spectator.

92. These rules serve as standards when passion might cloud particular judgments.

93. Reverence for general moral rules is what we call a sense of duty.

94. Acting from a sense of duty—from respect for the general rule—is morally praiseworthy even when not prompted by immediate sympathy.

95. Moral systems that derive all virtue from self-love are fundamentally mistaken; sympathy is irreducible.

96. Moral systems that reduce all virtue to propriety (the Stoics) neglect the distinct phenomenon of merit.

97. Moral systems that reduce virtue to benevolence alone neglect the special status of justice.

98. The casuists erred in trying to specify rules for every conceivable case; moral judgment requires contextual discernment.

99. Utility may explain why we approve of certain sentiments, but our approval is not derived from reflection on utility.

100. The sentiment of moral approbation is immediate and original; it is not reducible to calculations of interest or advantage.

# Adam Smith — *The Wealth of Nations* (1776)
## 100 Position Statements

1. The division of labor is the principal cause of improvement in the productive powers of labor.

2. The extent of the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market.

3. Human beings have a natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another.

4. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, brewer, or baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.

5. The real price of everything is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.

6. Labor is the original measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.

7. In the early and rude state of society, labor alone determined value; in advanced societies, capital and land also claim shares.

8. The natural price of a commodity is that which covers wages, profit, and rent at their ordinary rates.

9. Market price gravitates toward natural price through the mechanism of supply and demand.

10. Wages, profit, and rent are the three original sources of all revenue and all exchangeable value.

11. The interest of dealers is always in some respects opposite to that of the public—to narrow competition and raise prices.

12. The real wealth of a country consists in the annual produce of its land and labor, not in gold and silver.

13. Money is merely the wheel of circulation, not the goods that circulate upon it.

14. Capital naturally seeks the employment most advantageous to society when each individual pursues his own advantage.

15. An individual intending only his own gain is led by an invisible hand to promote the public interest.

16. The sovereign has no place in superintending the industry of private people and directing it toward employments most suitable to society.

17. Every individual knows his own local situation better than any statesman or lawgiver can know it for him.

18. The accumulation of stock (capital) must precede the division of labor.

19. Parsimony, not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase of capital.

20. What is annually saved is as regularly consumed as what is annually spent, but by productive rather than unproductive laborers.

21. Prodigals are public enemies; frugal men are public benefactors.

22. The natural progress of opulence proceeds from agriculture to manufacture to foreign commerce.

23. The policy of Europe has inverted this natural order by favoring towns over the countryside.

24. High wages are both the effect and the cause of national prosperity.

25. Where wages are high, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent, and expeditious.

26. The liberal reward of labor encourages population and the industry of the common people.

27. Masters have the advantage over workers in disputes about wages because they can hold out longer.

28. The laws against combinations of workers are executed with rigor; those against masters' combinations are rarely enforced.

29. Wages vary according to the agreeableness of the employment, the cost of learning it, the constancy of employment, the trust reposed, and the probability of success.

30. The rate of profit falls as stock increases and competition among merchants intensifies.

31. High profits tend to raise the price of goods more than high wages do.

32. Rent is a monopoly price—the highest the tenant can afford to pay given the circumstances.

33. Landlords reap where they have not sown, demanding rent even for the natural produce of the earth.

34. The interest of the landlord is strictly connected with the general interest of society.

35. The interest of merchants and manufacturers is always to deceive and oppress the public.

36. The proposal of any new law from merchants should be received with the greatest suspicion.

37. Agriculture is the most productive employment of capital, then manufacture, then wholesale trade, then retail trade.

38. Every individual endeavors to employ his capital as near home as he can.

39. The statesman who attempts to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals assumes an authority unsafe in any council or senate.

40. Restraints on importation give a monopoly to domestic industry at the expense of consumers.

41. Monopoly raises the rate of profit but depresses that of wages.

42. The mercantile system enriches merchants and manufacturers at the expense of landlords and farmers.

43. Exportation bounties are taxes upon the people for the benefit of particular traders.

44. The real effect of bounties is not to increase production but to divert it to less advantageous channels.

45. Colonial trade monopolies are a manifest violation of the natural rights of mankind.

46. Free trade is the most advantageous to the mother country as well as to the colonies.

47. Colonies have been a source of expense rather than revenue to their mother countries.

48. The discovery of America and the passage to the East Indies were the two greatest events in human history.

49. The monopoly of colonial trade has drawn capital from other trades, raised profits, and diminished improvements.

50. Treaties of commerce favoring one nation over another are advantageous only to merchants and manufacturers.

51. The balance of trade doctrine is absurd; a nation can never be ruined by trade.

52. Nothing can be more absurd than the doctrine that exports of gold and silver impoverish a nation.

53. The quantity of gold and silver in any country regulates itself according to the effectual demand.

54. Paper money may perform all the functions of gold and silver with far less expense.

55. Banks increase industry not by augmenting capital but by making more of it active.

56. The operations of banking should be limited to discounting bills of exchange arising from real transactions.

57. A bank that issues notes beyond what circulation can absorb injures itself and the public.

58. Public stock companies succeed only in banking, insurance, canals, and water supply—trades reducible to routine.

59. Joint-stock companies without exclusive privileges rarely succeed; with them, they manage badly.

60. The exclusive privileges of corporations are real encroachments upon natural liberty.

61. The statute of apprenticeship and corporation laws restrain the free circulation of labor and capital.

62. Long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary; the real abilities of workmen come from practice.

63. The laws of settlement obstruct the free circulation of labor from parish to parish.

64. The price of labor cannot be ascertained by any statute but is settled by private bargain.

65. Taxes upon necessaries raise wages and thereby fall upon profits and rents.

66. Taxes upon luxuries consumed by the laboring poor raise wages less certainly than taxes on necessaries.

67. A tax upon house-rents falls upon the occupier but is ultimately borne by the landlord.

68. Taxes upon the produce of land are ultimately paid by the landlord through diminished rent.

69. Tithes discourage improvement and are unequal taxes on rent.

70. A tax upon the profits of stock falls ultimately upon consumers through higher prices.

71. Capitation taxes are inquisitorial and arbitrary in nature.

72. Taxes upon consumable commodities may be collected through customs or excise with varying effects.

73. The four maxims of taxation are equality, certainty, convenience of payment, and economy of collection.

74. The expense of defense is the first duty of the sovereign.

75. Standing armies are superior to militias in discipline and effectiveness.

76. The expense of justice may be defrayed by court fees without corrupting the administration of justice.

77. Public works facilitating commerce—roads, bridges, canals—should be maintained by tolls proportional to use.

78. Education of youth is a proper object of public attention, particularly for the laboring poor.

79. The division of labor renders workers stupid and ignorant; education counteracts this evil.

80. The state derives considerable advantage from the instruction of the common people.

81. Religious instruction should not be left to the state but operates best through competition among sects.

82. Public diversions—painting, poetry, music—dissipate the gloom of superstition and enthusiasm.

83. The expense of maintaining the dignity of the sovereign should be proportionate to national revenue.

84. Debts contracted in war are seldom honestly discharged; governments prefer perpetual funding.

85. Public debts have ruined every state that has contracted them extensively.

86. The funding system diverts capital from productive employment to unproductive government consumption.

87. Sinking funds meant to discharge debt invariably become resources for new expenditure.

88. National bankruptcy through currency debasement or open default is the likely end of extensive debt.

89. Monopolies of colonial trade have loaded the revenue with expense while benefiting only particular orders.

90. Great Britain should voluntarily give up all authority over the colonies or admit them to parliamentary representation.

91. Union with the colonies would bring an immense accession of revenue and military strength.

92. The diminution of manufacturing employment from free trade is temporary; labor finds new channels.

93. Gradual, not sudden, restoration of free trade minimizes disruption to established industries.

94. Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition.

95. No society can flourish while the greater part of its members are poor and miserable.

96. Civil government is instituted for the defense of property—of the rich against the poor.

97. Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality; the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many.

98. The improvement of the productive powers of labor depends first on the skill, dexterity, and judgment of workers.

99. Commerce and manufactures gradually introduce order, good government, and individual liberty.

100. The natural effort of every individual to better his own condition is so powerful that alone it can carry society to wealth and prosperity despite obstruction by law.

# Adam Smith — *The Wealth of Nations* (1776)
## 100 Additional Position Statements

101. The productive powers of labor are increased by the division of operations into distinct tasks performed by separate workers.

102. A pin factory exemplifies how subdivision of labor multiplies output beyond what separated workmen could achieve.

103. The division of labor occasions invention of machines by focusing workers' attention on single operations.

104. Philosophers and porters differ less by nature than by habit, education, and employment.

105. The certainty of being able to exchange surplus produce encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation.

106. Water carriage opens wider markets than land carriage and thereby extends the division of labor.

107. The first civilizations arose along seacoasts and navigable rivers where markets were naturally extensive.

108. Inland Africa and northern Asia remain barbarous because they lack navigable waterways to extend commerce.

109. The word "value" has two meanings: utility (value in use) and purchasing power (value in exchange).

110. Diamonds have great value in exchange but little value in use; water the reverse.

111. Labor is the only universal and accurate measure of value, being the real price; money is the nominal price.

112. Equal quantities of labor are of equal value to the laborer at all times and places, though they appear otherwise in money.

113. Corn (grain) is a better measure of value over long periods than silver, which fluctuates more.

114. The component parts of price are wages, profit, and rent—each varying independently.

115. Some commodities yield only wages (gathered berries); others wages and profit; others all three.

116. The ordinary rate of profit depends on the general circumstances of the society—its riches, poverty, or progress.

117. The ordinary rate of profit is more difficult to ascertain than wages; businessmen rarely know their own profits exactly.

118. Interest rates may serve as an index of profit rates—high interest signals high profits.

119. The lowest ordinary rate of profit must be something more than enough to compensate occasional losses.

120. The highest ordinary rate of profit may absorb almost the whole rent and leave only minimum wages.

121. New colonies have high wages and high profits simultaneously because land is cheap and capital scarce.

122. In countries advancing to riches, both wages and profits may rise together for a time.

123. A stationary country has low wages; a declining country has miserable wages and near-zero profits.

124. China has long been stationary; its wages are barely sufficient for subsistence.

125. Bengal under the East India Company exemplifies a declining economy with falling wages and profits.

126. Rent enters into price in a different manner than wages and profit—it is effect, not cause.

127. High or low wages and profit are causes of high or low price; high or low rent is the effect.

128. Land used for human food always yields rent; land for other purposes may or may not.

129. Rent rises with population because demand for food increases while fertile land is limited.

130. The extension of improvement and cultivation tends to raise the price of animal food relative to grain.

131. Mines yield rent only if their produce exceeds the cost of extraction plus ordinary profits.

132. Precious metals from the richest mines set the price; poorer mines yield no rent.

133. The discovery of American silver mines reduced the value of silver throughout Europe.

134. The progressive improvement of cultivation raises the relative value of precious metals eventually by raising food prices.

135. Wealth consists not in money but in what money purchases—the consumable goods that constitute real revenue.

136. The gross revenue of society is the whole annual produce; the net revenue is what remains after maintaining fixed and circulating capital.

137. Fixed capital yields revenue only by circulating; a machine produces nothing without materials and workers.

138. Circulating capital constantly goes from the dealer and returns with a profit.

139. The four parts of circulating capital are money, provisions, materials, and finished work not yet sold.

140. Money is the only part of circulating capital that diminishes net revenue by its maintenance cost.

141. Paper money substitutes for gold and silver, releasing precious metals for other uses.

142. The whole paper money of a country cannot exceed the gold and silver it replaces.

143. When paper exceeds this proportion, it returns upon banks for payment, draining their reserves.

144. The Ayr Bank's failure in 1772 demonstrates the danger of over-issuing paper currency.

145. Banks should confine discounts to bills arising from real transactions, not accommodation bills.

146. A banker who lends to projectors and undertakers may advance not capital but consumption funds.

147. Productive labor adds value to materials; unproductive labor, however useful, adds nothing.

148. The labor of a manufacturer fixes itself in a vendible commodity; that of a menial servant perishes instantly.

149. Sovereigns, churchmen, lawyers, physicians, actors, and buffoons are unproductive laborers.

150. A rich country has a higher proportion of productive to unproductive laborers than a poor one.

151. Great nations are never impoverished by private prodigality but sometimes by public profusion.

152. What is annually saved is immediately employed as capital and consumed by productive workers.

153. The profusion of government often stems from the misconduct of those entrusted with public revenue.

154. Every prodigal is a public enemy; every frugal man a public benefactor.

155. Capital may be employed in extracting, manufacturing, transporting, or distributing goods—agriculture, manufacture, wholesale, or retail trade.

156. No equal capital puts into motion more productive labor than that employed in agriculture.

157. Nature labors along with man in agriculture; in manufacture, nature does nothing.

158. The capital of the wholesale merchant replaces that of farmers and manufacturers, freeing them to continue production.

159. The capital of the retailer replaces that of the wholesaler and serves the convenience of buyers.

160. The foreign trade of consumption exchanges domestic surplus for foreign goods demanded at home.

161. The carrying trade transports goods between foreign countries, contributing to their mutual commerce.

162. The capital employed in the carrying trade is entirely absent from the home country.

163. Round-about foreign trade employs less domestic labor than direct trade with neighbors.

164. Every individual prefers domestic to foreign employment, giving security to domestic industry.

165. The study of his own advantage naturally leads individuals to prefer employments most advantageous to society.

166. No regulation of commerce can increase the quantity of industry beyond what capital can maintain.

167. Regulation can only divert industry into directions it would not otherwise take.

168. Such diversion cannot be advantageous when individuals are left free to judge for themselves.

169. The natural advantages one country has over another are sometimes so great that competition is vain.

170. If foreign goods can be bought cheaper than made at home, it is better to buy them.

171. The maxim true for every private family cannot be folly for a great kingdom.

172. To give monopoly of the home market to domestic industry is to direct private industry in a manner useless or hurtful.

173. The industry of society can only increase as capital increases; regulation cannot multiply capital.

174. Only two cases justify restraints on importation: defense industries and retaliatory duties to obtain free trade.

175. Defense is more important than opulence; the Navigation Acts, though hurtful to commerce, are wise.

176. Retaliation may be good policy when there is probability of obtaining repeal of foreign restrictions.

177. When restrictions have been long established, humanity requires they be removed slowly and gradually.

178. The clamor of merchants and manufacturers should not mislead legislators into believing that private interest equals public interest.

179. The sneaking arts of underling tradesmen are erected into political maxims by great manufacturing nations.

180. The monopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers neither is nor ought to be the rulers of mankind.

181. Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; the interest of the producer should be attended to only so far as necessary for promoting that of the consumer.

182. The mercantile system sacrifices consumers to producers, treating consumption as the means and production as the end.

183. Every extraordinary encouragement to exportation is really a tax upon the people.

184. The bounty on corn exportation has not lowered prices; it has encouraged cultivation without extending the market.

185. Drawbacks—returning duties on re-exported goods—are the only encouragements to exportation that do not harm.

186. Duties imposed to discourage consumption are less objectionable than prohibitions for the sake of producers.

187. Treaties of commerce are advantageous only to merchants seeking monopoly against consumers.

188. The Methuen Treaty giving Portuguese wines advantage over French was made for benefit of wine merchants, not consumers.

189. Free trade with France would bring cheaper and better wines but injure British merchants in the Portugal trade.

190. Colonies contribute to the mother country's power more by the market they provide than by the revenue they yield.

191. The American colonies have been a source of expense, not revenue, to Britain for over a century.

192. The colonial monopoly has diverted British capital from nearer to more distant trades, reducing aggregate returns.

193. The monopoly has raised profits in the colony trade, depressing them in other branches by attraction of capital.

194. All the original injustice of colonization admits of no palliation from the fortune it has produced.

195. The rulers of Britain have amused the people with the imagination they possess an empire on the west side of the Atlantic.

196. This empire has existed in imagination only; Britain should either realize it or rid herself of the expense.

197. The corn laws serve landowners at the expense of all other orders of citizens.

198. The motives of the landed interest in restricting importation are honest but mistaken; those of merchants are neither.

199. Agriculture flourishes best under a system of natural liberty, without bounties, prohibitions, or preferences.

200. The whole system of British policy with respect to the colonies is a system of political economy founded on monopoly.

# Economic Position Statements from Six Thinkers in the Classical-to-Keynesian Tradition

---

## DAVID RICARDO (1772–1823)
*Principles of Political Economy and Taxation* (1817)

1. The value of a commodity depends on the relative quantity of labor necessary for its production, not on the compensation paid for that labor.

2. Commodities derive their exchangeable value from scarcity or from the quantity of labor required to obtain them.

3. The natural price of labor is that price necessary to enable laborers to subsist and perpetuate their race without increase or diminution.

4. The market price of labor may deviate from the natural price, but it gravitates toward it in the long run.

5. Profits depend on wages; whatever raises wages necessarily lowers profits.

6. As society advances and cultivation extends to inferior soils, rent rises and profits fall.

7. Rent is that portion of the produce of the earth paid to the landlord for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil.

8. Rent arises from the difference in fertility between cultivated lands and the least fertile land in use.

9. No rent is paid for land on the margin of cultivation; the whole produce goes to wages and profits.

10. The natural tendency of profits is to fall because the progress of wealth increases the demand for food, requiring resort to poorer soils.

11. Improvements in agriculture may temporarily arrest the fall of profits by reducing the labor needed to produce necessaries.

12. Machinery does not necessarily diminish the demand for labor; its effect depends on whether it releases capital for other employment.

13. The interest of the landlord is always opposed to that of every other class in the community.

14. Taxes on raw produce fall on consumers, not on landlords, and raise money wages without increasing real wages.

15. Taxes on wages ultimately fall on profits, as capitalists must maintain the real wages of labor.

16. The principle of comparative advantage determines that trade benefits both nations even when one produces all goods more efficiently.

17. Under free trade, each country devotes capital and labor to employments most advantageous to each.

18. Gold and silver distribute themselves among nations according to the state of trade and payments, requiring no legislation.

19. A fall in the value of money raises all money prices but alters no real relationships among commodities.

20. The value of money in different countries is regulated by the quantity of labor necessary to produce precious metals at the mines.

21. Paper money depreciation occurs when the currency exceeds what would circulate if it were convertible to gold.

22. Public expenditure is unproductive consumption; funding wars by loans merely postpones the burden.

23. A tax on land rent would fall wholly on landlords and could not be shifted.

24. The corn laws injure all classes except landlords by artificially raising the price of necessaries.

25. The stationary state, where profits fall to a minimum and accumulation ceases, is the eventual destiny of all progressive economies.

## WILLIAM PLAYFAIR (1759–1823)
*Commercial and Political Atlas* (1786), *Statistical Breviary* (1801), and economic pamphlets

1. Complex numerical relationships are best comprehended when presented through visual diagrams rather than tables of figures.

2. The balance of trade between nations can be displayed graphically to reveal at a glance what columns of numbers obscure.

3. The rise and fall of national debts, revenues, and expenditures over time are rendered intelligible by the line graph.

4. Statistical charts allow the busy statesman to grasp in minutes what would require hours of tedious calculation.

5. The bar chart displays discrete quantities—exports of different nations—in immediately comparable form.

6. The pie chart exhibits the proportions of a whole, showing at once how revenues or territories are divided.

7. A nation's prosperity is best judged by the trend of its trade over decades, not by any single year's figures.

8. The funded debt of Britain has grown to dangerous proportions that diagrams make evident to the meanest capacity.

9. Paper credit, when not excessive, invigorates commerce; when overdone, it produces fictitious prosperity followed by collapse.

10. The decline of Spain and Portugal is traceable in their trade statistics—wealth from colonies produced indolence, not industry.

11. National wealth depends more on the industry and ingenuity of inhabitants than on possession of gold and silver.

12. Commerce enriches nations more securely than conquest; trade leaves both parties better off, war leaves both poorer.

13. The rate of increase of British exports, displayed graphically, demonstrates the superiority of manufacturing over agricultural wealth.

14. Taxation should be displayed visually so citizens understand the true burden government places upon them.

15. Population, revenue, and territory of European states can be compared at a glance using proportional circles.

16. Statistics without graphical display are like a mariner without charts—the data exists but cannot be navigated.

17. The area diagram displays simultaneously the quantity and duration of trade balances, integrating time and magnitude.

18. National accounts presented annually in graphical form would improve public understanding and governmental accountability.

19. The French Revolution's economic causes are visible in the fiscal statistics of the ancien régime—expenditure outran revenue for decades.

20. Empires rise and fall according to patterns visible in their commercial and financial statistics over generations.

21. The practical man of business requires tools different from the philosopher's abstractions; the chart is such a tool.

22. A single well-constructed diagram conveys more information than pages of descriptive prose.

23. The decline of Venice, Genoa, and the Dutch Republic is traceable in their trade statistics before it appeared in their politics.

24. Graphical methods should form part of the education of every statesman and merchant.

25. The progress of civilization itself may be measured by the growth of commerce displayed through chronological charts.

## CHARLES BABBAGE (1791–1871)
*On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures* (1832)

1. The division of labor extends beyond Smith's observations; mental labor can be divided and economized just as physical labor.

2. The master manufacturer should analyze every process to ascertain the precise cost of each distinct operation.

3. The time consumed by each separate process should be measured and recorded for purposes of economy.

4. Different operations require different degrees of skill; workers should be assigned and paid according to the skill their task requires.

5. Combining in one worker operations requiring different skill levels wastes either wages or talent.

6. The price of any manufactured article may be analyzed into raw materials, labor, machinery, and profit on capital.

7. Verification is a principle applicable to mental as well as mechanical operations—independent checks reduce errors.

8. Copying is among the most important operations in manufacture; accuracy and cheapness in copying determine quality of output.

9. Machinery extends human powers by increasing force, velocity, precision, or regularity beyond natural limits.

10. The great advantage of machinery is not replacing labor but ensuring uniformity of product.

11. The factory system succeeds because it unites under one roof all processes necessary for production, enabling constant superintendence.

12. Large factories enjoy economies unavailable to small producers—purchasing advantages, division of labor, use of by-products.

13. The cost of motive power per unit diminishes as the scale of operations increases.

14. Combinations among workmen to raise wages are generally injurious to the workers themselves through loss of employment.

15. Piece-rate payment aligns the interests of worker and employer more closely than day wages.

16. The prosperity of manufacturers and workmen are ultimately identical; neither can permanently gain at the other's expense.

17. Profit-sharing arrangements give workers an interest in the success of the enterprise and reduce antagonism.

18. Every improvement in machinery initially displaces workers but ultimately increases total employment by cheapening products.

19. Patents encourage invention by securing temporary reward but should be limited in duration.

20. The duty of government is to remove obstacles to industry, not to direct it.

21. Accurate statistics of manufactures would benefit all parties by revealing the true state of trades.

22. The calculating engine demonstrates that mental operations—computation—can be mechanized with perfect reliability.

23. Tables of logarithms and astronomical data are themselves manufactures, subject to the same principles as material goods.

24. Errors in mathematical tables arise from the division of mental labor improperly supervised; machinery eliminates human error.

25. The economy of manufactures depends ultimately on the economy of time—every process should be timed and rationalized.

## JOHN STUART MILL (1806–1873)
*Principles of Political Economy* (1848)

1. The laws of production are physical truths; the laws of distribution are human institutions, alterable by human will.

2. Property is not a single fixed institution but a bundle of rights that societies may configure differently.

3. Competition is the principal regulator of prices, wages, and profits, but its operation is modified by custom.

4. The laissez-faire principle is the general rule; departures from it require specific justification.

5. The functions of government may be classified into necessary and optional; the optional should be adopted cautiously.

6. Education is a proper function of government because parents cannot always judge what is best for children.

7. The stationary state is not to be dreaded; it may permit greater attention to distribution, culture, and quality of life.

8. Population tends to press upon subsistence; prudential restraint by the laboring classes is necessary for their advancement.

9. The improvement of women's condition and education is the surest means of checking excessive population.

10. Socialism is not incompatible with political economy; its feasibility depends on the moral improvement of mankind.

11. Peasant proprietorship develops the virtues of industry, frugality, and self-reliance better than wage labor.

12. Cooperation among workers for production and distribution offers a path between capitalism and socialism.

13. Inheritance laws should be reformed to limit the perpetuation of large fortunes across generations.

14. Land is not the product of labor; its appropriation requires different justification than property in movables.

15. A tax on the unearned increment of land would not discourage production and is eminently just.

16. The rate of profit tends toward a minimum determined by the effective desire of accumulation.

17. International trade is governed by reciprocal demand; the terms of trade depend on the intensity of each nation's demand.

18. Protection may be justified temporarily for infant industries that would become competitive with experience.

19. Customs unions among nations promote efficiency and serve as steps toward universal free trade.

20. Paper currency should be regulated to maintain convertibility; inconvertible paper invites abuse.

21. Joint-stock companies are suited only to businesses where routine operations predominate over discretionary management.

22. The wages fund doctrine is not rigidly fixed; employers may advance more to labor from revenue as well as capital.

23. Strikes and unions may raise wages when competition among employers is imperfect.

24. The taxation of commodities should fall on luxuries rather than necessities to minimize burden on the poor.

25. A proportional tax on income is preferable to taxes on particular commodities, being more equal and less distorting.

## ALFRED MARSHALL (1842–1924)
*Principles of Economics* (1890)

1. Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life—earning and using the material requisites of well-being.

2. Economic laws state tendencies expressed as "if...then" propositions, not invariable sequences.

3. The marginal utility of a commodity to any person diminishes with every increase in the quantity he already possesses.

4. Consumer surplus is the excess of the price a consumer would pay over what he actually pays.

5. Demand and supply are the two blades of a pair of scissors; neither alone determines price.

6. The equilibrium price is that at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

7. In the short run, supply is relatively fixed; in the long run, supply adjusts to demand through changes in production.

8. Time is the center of the chief difficulty of almost every economic problem.

9. The representative firm is a construct for analyzing normal profits and costs in an industry.

10. External economies arise from the general development of an industry, independent of any single firm's actions.

11. Internal economies arise from the resources, organization, and efficiency of individual firms.

12. Increasing returns in manufacturing stem from improved organization and machinery as output expands.

13. The law of diminishing returns applies to agriculture where land is fixed; manufacturing may exhibit increasing returns.

14. Quasi-rent is the return to fixed capital in the short run, analogous to land rent.

15. The earnings of labor are determined at the margin where the marginal product equals the wage.

16. The supply price of labor depends on the cost of rearing, training, and maintaining workers in efficiency.

17. Wages differ according to the efficiency of workers, and efficiency wages—the cost per unit of work—tend toward equality.

18. The elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price.

19. Highly elastic demand means small price changes cause large quantity changes; inelastic demand the reverse.

20. Monopoly restricts output below the competitive level, raising price and reducing consumer surplus.

21. The principle of substitution governs the combination of factors of production—each is used up to the point where its marginal product equals its price.

22. The national dividend is the aggregate net income of the community, the ultimate source of wages, interest, and profit.

23. Interest is the reward for waiting—for abstaining from immediate consumption to accumulate capital.

24. Economics should be approached with "cool heads but warm hearts," combining scientific rigor with humanitarian concern.

25. The mecca of the economist lies in economic biology rather than economic mechanics—organic growth, not static equilibrium.

## JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES (1883–1946)
*The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money* (1936) and related works

1. The classical theory of employment assumes that wage reductions clear labor markets, but workers resist money wage cuts and cannot reduce real wages by agreement.

2. Effective demand—the aggregate demand for output that entrepreneurs expect—determines the level of employment.

3. Aggregate demand consists of consumption expenditure and investment expenditure; when these fall short, unemployment results.

4. The propensity to consume determines what fraction of income is spent; the remainder is saved.

5. The marginal propensity to consume is less than unity; as income rises, a smaller fraction is consumed.

6. The multiplier relates changes in investment to changes in income—income increases by a multiple of the initial investment.

7. Investment depends on the marginal efficiency of capital—the expected yield of new capital relative to its supply price.

8. The marginal efficiency of capital is volatile because it depends on expectations about an uncertain future.

9. Interest is the reward for parting with liquidity—for giving up the convenience and security of holding money.

10. Liquidity preference determines the rate of interest, not the classical intersection of saving and investment.

11. The demand for money arises from transactions, precaution, and speculation motives; speculation links money-holding to interest rates.

12. In a liquidity trap, monetary policy becomes impotent; people hoard any additional money rather than bid down interest rates.

13. Saving and investment are brought into equality not by interest rate adjustments but by changes in income.

14. Involuntary unemployment exists when workers would accept employment at the prevailing wage but cannot find work.

15. Flexible wages would not cure unemployment; falling wages reduce demand as much as costs, leaving output unchanged.

16. Say's Law—that supply creates its own demand—is false; income may be hoarded rather than spent.

17. The economy may reach equilibrium at less than full employment, with no automatic tendency toward full employment.

18. Animal spirits—spontaneous optimism about the future—drive investment more than rational calculation.

19. Government expenditure can fill the gap left by deficient private investment and restore full employment.

20. Deficit spending is appropriate during depressions; balanced budgets should be a goal over the business cycle, not annually.

21. The paradox of thrift: individual virtue becomes collective vice when increased saving reduces aggregate demand.

22. The rate of interest should be managed to maintain full employment; monetary policy is a public responsibility.

23. The euthanasia of the rentier—gradual elimination of the functionless investor—is a natural consequence of abundant capital.

24. International capital flows should be controlled to permit national governments to pursue full employment policies.

25. The long-run is a misleading guide to current affairs; in the long run we are all dead.
