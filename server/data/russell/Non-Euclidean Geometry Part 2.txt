### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **First Period: Philosophical and Analytical Foundations**
   - The first period, initiated by Gauss, focused on the philosophical and analytical foundations of non-Euclidean geometry. Gauss's work on curvature laid the groundwork for understanding space as a manifold, and his investigations into the consequences of denying the parallel axiom were crucial.
   - This period is characterized by a strong philosophical motive, with Gauss and others exploring the implications of non-Euclidean systems on our understanding of space.

2. **Second Period: Metrical Geometry and Non-Euclidean Systems**
   - The second period, marked by the contributions of Lobatchewsky and others, established two non-Euclidean systems: hyperbolic and spherical geometry. These systems were developed using metrical geometry methods.
   - The measure of curvature, a concept introduced by Gauss and extended by Riemann and Helmholtz, became the fundamental property of space in this period.

3. **Third Period: Projective Geometry and the Absolute**
   - The third period, beginning with Cayley and further developed by Klein, shifted the focus to projective geometry. This period introduced the concept of the Absolute (Grundgebild), which allowed for the reduction of metrical properties to projective ones.
   - This period is characterized by a more technical and mathematical spirit, with less emphasis on philosophical motives. The introduction of elliptic geometry by Klein further expanded the non-Euclidean systems.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

### 4.7 Appeals to Intuition

1. **Intuitive Understanding of Space**: The text appeals to intuition in discussing the shift from intuitive to algebraic treatments of space by Riemann and Helmholtz. This is evident in the statement: "The latter, on the contrary, being guided by a philosophical rather than a mathematical spirit, endeavoured to classify the conception of space as a species of a more general conception: it treated space algebraically, and the properties it gave to space were expressed in terms, not of intuition, but of algebra."

### 4.8 Inference to Best Explanation

1. **Logical Independence of Axioms**: The text uses inference to the best explanation to argue that the logical independence of the parallel postulate is the best explanation for the development of consistent non-Euclidean geometries.

### 4.10 Dialectical Moves

1. **Engagement with Philosophical and Mathematical Divergence**: The text engages in a dialectical move by discussing the potential divergence between the philosophical and mathematical conclusions of Riemann and Helmholtz. This is evident in the statement: "While their philosophical purpose was, to prove that all the axioms of Geometry are empirical, and that a different content of our experience might have changed them all, the unintended result of their mathematical work was, if I am not mistaken, to afford material for an à priori proof of certain axioms."

### 4.11 Deconstructive Strategies

1. **Deconstruction of Euclidean Geometry**: The text employs a deconstructive strategy by challenging the foundational axioms of Euclidean geometry, particularly the parallel postulate, through the development of non-Euclidean geometries.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: Riemann's dissertation introduces two fundamental concepts-the manifold and the measure of curvature-aiming to classify space as a special case of a more general conception and to extend the notion of curvature to higher dimensions.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text argues that space should be understood as a manifold, a general conception capable of various determinations, and that the measure of curvature provides a way to analyze the properties of such manifolds.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Manifold as a General Conception**:
   - Riemann's concept of a manifold serves to exhibit space as an instance of a more general conception, allowing for a classification of space as a special case.
   - The manifold is defined as a continuous or discrete set of determinations of a general conception, with space and colors as examples.
   - This approach clarifies the axioms of geometry by presenting them as successive determinations of class-conceptions, culminating in Euclidean space.

2. **Measure of Curvature as an Analytical Tool**:
   - The measure of curvature, originally applied to surfaces by Gauss, is extended by Riemann to manifolds of n dimensions.
   - This extension allows for a more general analysis of geometric properties, independent of the specific dimensionality of the space.
   - The measure of curvature is described as a purely analytical expression, distinct from ordinary curvature, and is crucial for understanding the nature of space as a manifold.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Classification of Space**:
   - Riemann's approach to geometry involves classifying space through a series of axioms, akin to scholastic definitions, which refine the concept of space step by step.
   - This classification is presented as a logical and precise formulation, free of redundancy, and explicitly states the axioms as adjectives of the conception of space.

2. **Critique of Metrical Bias**:
   - The text critiques Riemann's metrical bias, which views space primarily as a magnitude, leading to obscurity about the nature of magnitude itself.
   - This critique suggests that Riemann's focus on measurement and quantity overlooks the qualitative aspects of space as a system of relations.

3. **Independence of Magnitudes**:
   - Riemann's assertion that measurement involves the superposition of magnitudes requires that these magnitudes be independent of their position in the manifold.
   - The simplest assumption for this independence is that the lengths of lines are position-independent, though other possibilities are not clearly articulated.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Analytical Approach**: The text assumes that an analytical approach to geometry, using algebraic methods, is the most effective way to understand and classify space.

2. **Space as a Magnitude**: Riemann's work assumes that space can be regarded as a magnitude, which is critiqued in the text as a limitation of his approach.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that Helmholtz's axioms for geometry, while mathematically sufficient to derive Euclidean and non-Euclidean systems, are overly broad and contain unnecessary elements. The text argues that these axioms can be reduced to a single fundamental principle, the relativity of position.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Critique of Congruence Axiom**: The text argues that Helmholtz's axiom of Congruence, which he claims is proved by experience, is problematic because it is unclear how lapses from Congruence could be discovered without measurement. This suggests that the axiom of Congruence might not be empirically verifiable in the way Helmholtz suggests.

   - **Explanation**: The text points out that Helmholtz's reliance on empirical proof for Congruence is flawed because it presupposes the very thing it aims to prove. Without a prior method of measurement, it is impossible to determine whether two objects are congruent, thus undermining the empirical basis of the axiom.

2. **Redundancy of Free Mobility Axiom**: The text argues that Helmholtz's axiom of Free Mobility is unnecessary because it is already implied by the axiom of Congruence and the homogeneity of space.

   - **Explanation**: The text suggests that the concept of free mobility is redundant because the ability of a point to move freely in space is a consequence of the homogeneity of space, which is itself a part of the axiom of Congruence. Therefore, stating it as a separate axiom is unnecessary.

3. **Critique of Monodromy Axiom**: The text argues that Helmholtz's axiom of Monodromy is superfluous and could be included in the axiom of Congruence.

   - **Explanation**: The text cites Sophus Lie's work to argue that the Monodromy axiom is not necessary from a purely analytical perspective. It suggests that the axiom of Congruence, if properly formulated, would already encompass the conditions described by the Monodromy axiom.

4. **Sufficiency of Relativity of Position**: The text argues that all relevant aspects of Helmholtz's four axioms can be derived from the single principle of the relativity of position.

   - **Explanation**: The text posits that the relativity of position is a more fundamental principle that can account for the necessary conditions of geometry without the need for multiple axioms. This principle suggests that the position of objects in space is relative and can be used to derive the necessary conditions for geometric systems.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Error in Assumption of Positive Curvature**: The text notes that Helmholtz's assumption that the measure of curvature cannot be negative is an error, which was later corrected in notes following Beltrami's work on negative curvature.

   - **Explanation**: This subsidiary claim highlights a specific mathematical error in Helmholtz's work, which undermines the validity of his conclusions about the nature of space and the applicability of his axioms.

2. **Helmholtz's Non-Professional Mathematical Approach**: The text argues that Helmholtz's mathematical work on geometry is slightly unprofessional, as noted by Klein, due to his background as a physicist and physiologist rather than a professional mathematician.

   - **Explanation**: This claim suggests that Helmholtz's lack of formal mathematical training may have led to errors and oversights in his work, such as the unnecessary axioms and the assumption of positive curvature.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Rationalist View of Axioms**: The text implicitly assumes a rationalist perspective on the nature of geometric axioms, suggesting that they should be derived from fundamental principles rather than empirical evidence.

2. **Importance of Logical Consistency**: The text assumes that logical consistency and the avoidance of redundancy are important criteria for evaluating the validity of geometric axioms.

3. **Historical Context as a Lens for Evaluation**: The text assumes that understanding the historical development of geometric theories is crucial for evaluating the contributions of individual thinkers like Helmholtz.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

This distinction supports the text's claim that the axiom of Congruence, if properly formulated, can account for the conditions described by the Monodromy axiom.

### 4.2 Argumentation Strategies

1. **Reductio ad Absurdum**: The text uses a reductio ad absurdum argument to critique Helmholtz's axiom of Congruence. It argues that if Congruence is proved by experience, and experience requires measurement, but measurement requires Congruence, then the axiom is circular and thus invalid.

   - **Explanation**: This argument strategy is used to highlight the logical inconsistency in Helmholtz's approach to proving Congruence. By showing that the axiom leads to a contradiction, the text undermines its validity.

2. **Modus Tollens**: The text employs a modus tollens argument to critique the necessity of Helmholtz's axioms. It argues that if the axioms are necessary, then they should not be reducible to a single principle, but since they can be reduced to the principle of the relativity of position, they are not necessary.

   - **Explanation**: This argument strategy is used to support the text's thesis that Helmholtz's axioms are overly broad and can be reduced to a more fundamental principle. By showing that the axioms lead to a false conclusion, the text argues for their redundancy.

### 4.3 Category Error Detection

1. **Empirical vs. Rationalist Axioms**: The text detects a category error in Helmholtz's approach to geometric axioms, arguing that he conflates empirical and rationalist categories. Helmholtz's claim that Congruence can be proved by experience is seen as a category error because geometric axioms are typically considered rationalist constructs.

   - **Explanation**: The text argues that Helmholtz's empirical approach to proving Congruence is a category error because it attempts to empirically verify a concept that is fundamentally a rationalist construct. This error undermines the validity of Helmholtz's axioms.

### 4.4 Counterfactual Reasoning

1. **Alternative Formulation of Axioms**: The text uses counterfactual reasoning to argue that if the axiom of Congruence were properly formulated, it would include the conditions described by Helmholtz's other axioms, making them unnecessary.

   - **Explanation**: This counterfactual reasoning supports the text's thesis that Helmholtz's axioms are overly broad. By imagining an alternative formulation of the axiom of Congruence, the text argues that it can account for the conditions described by the other axioms, thus rendering them superfluous.

### 4.5 Thought Experiments

1. **Measurement Without Congruence**: The text uses a thought experiment to critique Helmholtz's axiom of Congruence, asking how lapses from Congruence could be discovered without measurement.

   - **Explanation**: This thought experiment highlights the circularity of Helmholtz's approach to proving Congruence. By imagining a scenario where measurement is not possible, the text argues that the axiom cannot be empirically verified, thus undermining its validity.

### 4.6 Analogies and Comparisons

1. **Comparison to Other Mathematicians**: The text uses analogies and comparisons to other mathematicians, such as Riemann, Gauss, Minding, and Beltrami, to critique Helmholtz's work. It argues that these mathematicians' contributions provide a more rigorous and accurate foundation for geometry.

By highlighting the contributions of other mathematicians, the text argues that Helmholtz's approach is flawed and unnecessary.

### 4.7 Appeals to Intuition

1. **Intuitive Understanding of Space**: The text appeals to the reader's intuition about the nature of space to critique Helmholtz's axiom of Free Mobility. It argues that the concept of free mobility is unnecessary because it is intuitively clear that empty space offers no barrier to a point's progress.

   - **Explanation**: This appeal to intuition supports the text's argument that the axiom of Free Mobility is redundant. By invoking the reader's intuitive understanding of space, the text argues that the axiom is unnecessary and can be derived from more fundamental principles.

### 4.8 Inference to Best Explanation

1. **Relativity of Position as Fundamental Principle**: The text uses inference to the best explanation to argue that the principle of the relativity of position is a more fundamental and sufficient basis for geometry than Helmholtz's axioms.

   - **Explanation**: This inference supports the text's thesis that Helmholtz's axioms are overly broad and can be reduced to a single principle. By arguing that the relativity of position can account for all relevant aspects of geometry, the text provides a more parsimonious explanation for the necessary conditions of geometric systems.

### 4.9 Transcendental Arguments

1. **Necessity of Axioms**: The text uses a transcendental argument to critique the necessity of Helmholtz's axioms. It argues that if these axioms are necessary for geometry, then they should not be reducible to a single principle, but since they can be reduced to the principle of the relativity of position, they are not necessary.

   - **Explanation**: This transcendental argument supports the text's thesis that Helmholtz's axioms are overly broad. By showing that the axioms are not necessary for the conditions they describe, the text argues for their redundancy.

### 4.10 Dialectical Moves

1. **Critique and Counter-Argument**: The text engages in a dialectical move by critiquing Helmholtz's axioms and then proposing an alternative principle, the relativity of position, to account for the necessary conditions of geometry.

   - **Explanation**: This dialectical move supports the text's thesis by presenting a critique of Helmholtz's axioms and then offering a counter-argument based on a more fundamental principle. It allows the text to engage with Helmholtz's work while proposing a more parsimonious explanation for geometric systems.

### 4.11 Deconstructive Strategies

1. **Deconstruction of Axioms**: The text uses deconstructive strategies to critique Helmholtz's axioms, arguing that they are overly broad and contain unnecessary elements. It deconstructs the axioms by showing that they can be reduced to a single principle, the relativity of position.

   - **Explanation**: This deconstructive strategy supports the text's thesis by breaking down Helmholtz's axioms and showing that they are not necessary for the conditions they describe. By deconstructing the axioms, the text argues for their redundancy and proposes a more fundamental principle.

### 4.12 Hermeneutical Approaches

1. **Historical Contextualization**: The text uses a hermeneutical approach to situate Helmholtz's work within the broader historical and mathematical context. It references the contributions of other mathematicians and the development of non-Euclidean geometry to interpret and critique Helmholtz's axioms.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the definition of distance in geometry is arbitrary and a matter of convention, and that metrical geometry is a branch of descriptive geometry. This thesis is articulated in multiple formulations throughout the text:

1. **Arbitrary Definition of Distance**: "Since this definition, on their view, is perfectly arbitrary, the philosophical problem vanishes-Euclidean space is left in undisputed possession, and the only problem remaining is one of convention and mathematical convenience."
2. **Metrical as a Branch of Descriptive Geometry**: "The importance of the memoir, to Cayley, lies entirely in its proof that metrical is only a branch of descriptive Geometry."

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Cayley's Theory of Distance**
   - **Explanation**: Cayley's theory posits that distance can be defined as the inverse sine or cosine of a function of coordinates, and this definition transforms metrical properties into projective properties. This argument supports the thesis by showing that metrical geometry can be subsumed under projective geometry.
   - **Textual Support**: "definition of distance, as the inverse sine or cosine of a certain function of the coordinates; with this definition, the properties usually known as metrical become projective properties."

2. **Klein's Connection to Metageometry**
   - **Explanation**: Klein's work shows that different types of geometries (Euclidean, hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic) can be derived from a Euclidean plane by altering the definition of distance. This supports the thesis by demonstrating the arbitrariness of the definition of distance.
   - **Textual Support**: "Klein showed in detail that, if the Absolute be real, we get Lobatchewsky's (hyperbolic) system; if it be imaginary, we get either spherical Geometry or a new system, analogous to that of Helmholtz, called by Klein elliptic."

3. **Poincaré's View on Geometric Axioms**
   - **Explanation**: Poincaré argues that geometric axioms are conventions rather than truths, which supports the thesis by reinforcing the idea that the definition of distance is arbitrary.
   - **Textual Support**: "What ought one to think," he says, "of this question: Is the Euclidean Geometry true? The question is nonsense."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Cayley's Proof of Metrical as Descriptive**
   - **Explanation**: Cayley's proof that metrical geometry is a branch of descriptive geometry is a subsidiary claim that supports the main thesis by providing a theoretical foundation for the arbitrariness of distance.
   - **Textual Support**: "The importance of the memoir, to Cayley, lies entirely in its proof that metrical is only a branch of descriptive Geometry."

2. **Distinction Between Projective and Metrical Coordinates**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that projective coordinates are inadequate for expressing metrical properties because they lack metrical presuppositions. This supports the thesis by highlighting the distinction between different types of coordinates and their implications for the definition of distance.
   - **Textual Support**: "projective coordinates... though perfectly adequate for all projective properties, and entirely free from any metrical presupposition, are inadequate to express metrical properties."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Formalist Approach to Mathematics**: The text assumes a formalist approach, where mathematical definitions and axioms are seen as conventions rather than truths derived from empirical reality.
2. **Independence of Projective Geometry**: There is an assumption that projective geometry is independent of metrical geometry, which is crucial for the argument that metrical geometry can be reduced to projective geometry.
3. **Arbitrariness of Mathematical Definitions**: The text assumes that mathematical definitions, such as the definition of distance, can be chosen arbitrarily without affecting the validity of the mathematical system.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The logical structure of the argument can be outlined as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: Cayley's theory of distance defines distance in terms of projective properties.
2. **Premise 2**: Klein's work shows that different geometries can be derived from a Euclidean plane by altering the definition of distance.
3. **Premise 3**: Poincaré argues that geometric axioms are conventions.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

2. **Secondary Formulation:** The metrical definition of distance is essential and irreducible, applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, and cannot be fully captured by projective methods.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Argument 1: Ambiguity in Projective Geometry**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that projective geometry introduces ambiguity in the concept of distance because it cannot distinguish between fewer than four points on a line. This ambiguity is inherent to projective principles and cannot be resolved within the framework of projective geometry.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** The text states, "The ambiguity thus introduced is unavoidable on projective principles; but are we to conclude, from this, that it is really unavoidable?"

2. **Argument 2: Necessity of Metrical Geometry for Distance**
   - **Explanation:** The text asserts that to distinguish between points on a line, a relation independent of other points (i.e., distance in the ordinary sense) must be presupposed before applying projective methods.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** "Before we can distinguish the two fixed points, therefore, from which the projective definition starts, we must already suppose some relation, between any two points on our line, in which they are independent of other points; and this relation is distance in the ordinary sense."

3. **Argument 3: Misinterpretation by Projective Geometers**
   - **Explanation:** The text critiques projective geometers for conflating the projective definition of distance with the ordinary metrical definition, leading to a denial of the unique relation between two points.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** "No name remains, therefore, for distance in the ordinary sense, and many projective Geometers, having abolished the name, believe the thing to be abolished also, and are inclined to deny that two points have a unique relation at all."

4. **Argument 4: Applicability of Metrical Definition to Non-Euclidean Geometries**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that the metrical definition of distance is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, emphasizing that the difference between these geometries lies in their metrical properties.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** "The metrical definition of distance-which, according to the view here advocated, is the only adequate definition-is the same in Euclidean and in non-Euclidean spaces."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Role of Base-Points in Projective Geometry**
   - **Explanation:** The text explains that the choice of base-points in projective geometry is a technical device and not arbitrary when discussing distance in the ordinary sense.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** "But the choice of these base-points, when we are discussing distance in the ordinary sense, is not arbitrary, and their introduction is only a technical device."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Correlation with Euclidean Space**
   - **Explanation:** The text discusses the correlation between non-Euclidean spaces and Euclidean space, emphasizing that this correlation does not imply subordination but rather highlights the self-subsistence of non-Euclidean spaces.
   - **Supporting Evidence:** "The correlation with Euclidean space is regarded as valuable, first, because Euclidean space has been longer studied and is more familiar, but secondly, because this correlation proves, when truly interpreted, that the other spaces are self-subsistent."
