BERTRAND RUSSELL POSITION STATEMENTS FROM MAJOR WORKS

=== THE ANALYSIS OF MATTER (1927) ===

1. Physics tells us only about the structure of the physical world, not about its intrinsic nature.
2. Our knowledge of the external world is entirely structural or relational, never qualitative.
3. Events, not substances or particles, are the fundamental constituents of the physical world.
4. Percepts are a subset of the events that constitute the brain.
5. Naive realism is false: our percepts do not directly reveal the intrinsic qualities of external objects.
6. The only things we know non-inferentially are our own percepts and their qualities.
7. Physical objects are logical constructions out of events.
8. Causation is to be understood in terms of functional relations between events, not as a metaphysical power.
9. The distinction between mind and matter is not fundamental but reflects different causal arrangements of neutral events.
10. What physics describes as matter is really groups of events connected by causal laws.
11. Space-time structure is knowable through physics, but the intrinsic character of what occupies space-time is not.
12. Inference from percepts to their external causes is justified by the principle of causal continuity.
13. The qualities we directly experience (colors, sounds, etc.) exist only in percepts, not in external objects.
14. Physical space and perceptual space are distinct; physics deals only with the former.
15. The electron and other theoretical entities are logical fictions constructed from groups of events.
16. The causal theory of perception is the correct account of how we perceive external objects.
17. All empirical knowledge of the world beyond our percepts depends on causal inference.
18. The "matter" of physics is far more abstract than common sense supposes.
19. There is no good reason to believe that physical objects have any intrinsic nature beyond their structural properties.
20. The world described by physics is not the world of everyday experience but a mathematical abstraction.
21. Neutral monism provides a more economical ontology than either materialism or idealism.
22. Mind and brain are different aspects of the same underlying neutral events.
23. The only intrinsic qualities we know are the qualities of our own mental states.
24. Modern physics (relativity and quantum mechanics) supports a structural rather than substantival view of matter.
25. Space and time are not independent realities but aspects of the relations among events.
26. Perception involves a causal chain from external object to brain event, and the percept occurs at the end of that chain.
27. We cannot know whether the intrinsic nature of external events resembles the intrinsic nature of our percepts.
28. The common-sense distinction between "real" and "apparent" properties cannot be maintained.
29. Scientific inference from percepts to physics requires assuming that similar structures have similar causes.
30. The physical world is not directly observable; all observation is of percepts.
31. Traditional materialism errs in ascribing to matter qualities that belong only to percepts.
32. Physical objects do not have color, sound, smell, or any secondary qualities in themselves.
33. The brain is part of the physical world, and mental events are identical with certain brain events.
34. Our knowledge of physics is hypothetical knowledge about structure, confirmed by its predictive success.
35. The distinction between physics and psychology is a difference in the causal laws studied, not in the entities involved.
36. All that physics can legitimately assert about matter is its mathematical-structural properties.
37. The continuity of nature suggests that the intrinsic character of events outside brains is not wholly unlike percepts.
38. There is no dualistic gap between mind and matter because both reduce to events.
39. Substance is a metaphysical illusion; what exists is patterns of events.
40. The inference from percepts to external causes is probabilistic, not demonstrative.
41. Scientific realism must be reformulated as structural realism rather than naive realism about theoretical entities.
42. Quantum mechanics reveals that the classical picture of determinate particles is false.
43. The physical world is a four-dimensional manifold of events related by causal laws.
44. Perception gives us direct knowledge only of the terminus of a causal process, not of its origin.
45. The principle of spatiotemporal continuity in causation underwrites inference from effect to cause.
46. Mental causation is a species of physical causation involving brain events.
47. Epistemological dualism (between percepts and objects) does not entail ontological dualism (between mind and matter).

=== THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921) ===

1. Mind and matter are both logical constructions out of a neutral stuff that is neither mental nor physical in itself.
2. Consciousness is not a unique substance or entity but a particular arrangement of neutral elements.
3. Sensations are the intersection point where physics and psychology meet; they belong to both domains.
4. Introspection is not a separate faculty revealing a private mental realm but simply attention directed at certain events.
5. The subject or ego is not a substantive entity but a logical fiction constructed from experiences.
6. Belief is a quality of certain mental occurrences, not a relation between a mind and a proposition.
7. Desire is to be analyzed in terms of behavior and discomfort cycles, not as a primitive mental act.
8. Images differ from sensations in their causes and effects, not in their intrinsic nature.
9. Memory is not direct acquaintance with the past but present images accompanied by a feeling of pastness.
10. Meaning is constituted by the causal relations between words and what they signify, not by mental acts of meaning.
11. Words acquire meaning through association with objects and situations, not through private definitions.
12. Thought can occur without language, though language greatly extends its scope and precision.
13. There is no act of consciousness distinct from its objects; consciousness is adverbial, not substantival.
14. The traditional distinction between mental acts and their contents is spurious.
15. Behaviorism is partially correct: much of what we call mental can be analyzed in behavioral terms.
16. Behaviorism is partially incorrect: it cannot account for images, which are genuine mental particulars.
17. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to present sensations and images.
18. Knowledge of the external world and other minds is entirely inferential.
19. Propositions are not entities; what exists are propositional attitudes, which are complex psychological facts.
20. Imagination consists of images that are copies of past sensations, operating under different causal laws.
21. The distinction between true and false beliefs lies in their correspondence or non-correspondence with facts.
22. Emotions are complex states involving sensations, images, and bodily feelings.
23. Will is not a special faculty but desire plus belief that action will achieve the desired end.
24. Habit, not reason, governs most human behavior.
25. Instinct is inherited habit, modified by experience but not created by it.
26. Perception is not passive reception but active construction involving inference and interpretation.
27. The "self" is a series of experiences connected by memory and causal continuity, not a persisting substance.
28. There is no pure ego or transcendental subject underlying experience.
29. Mental events are distinguished from physical events by their causal laws, not by their intrinsic nature.
30. Mnemic causation (where past events influence present behavior without intermediate links) is fundamental to psychology.
31. Association of ideas is a real psychological law but does not fully explain the structure of thought.
32. Attention is selective response, not a special mental power directed by a homunculus.
33. Pleasure and pain are qualities of sensations, not separate mental entities.
34. The "intentionality" of mental states (their aboutness) reduces to causal and associative relations.
35. Language is a social phenomenon; meaning is public, not private.
36. Understanding a word consists in having appropriate images or behavioral responses associated with it.
37. General ideas are not abstract entities but habits of response to similarities among particulars.
38. Judgment is a complex of sensations, images, and feelings, not a unique mental act relating a mind to a proposition.
39. Truth is a property of beliefs, consisting in their correspondence with facts.
40. Facts are not propositions but arrangements of particulars that make propositions true or false.
41. The unconscious exists: mental causation can occur without conscious awareness.
42. Dreams are wish-fulfillments, as Freud claimed, though his specific theories require modification.
43. The analysis of mind requires both introspective and behavioral data; neither alone suffices.
44. Physics and psychology study the same neutral events from different perspectives and with different groupings.
45. There are no purely mental substances; the mind is a construction out of events that also constitute the body.
46. Personal identity over time is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing affair.
47. The feeling of familiarity is a distinct mental quality that can attach to any object of experience.
48. Vagueness is essential to most thought and language; precision is the exception, not the rule.

=== THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903) - SELECTIONS ===

1. Pure mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form "p implies q" where p and q contain only logical constants and variables.
2. Mathematics and logic are identical; mathematics is simply logic developed to a higher degree.
3. All mathematical concepts can be defined in terms of purely logical concepts.
4. All mathematical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms.
5. The natural numbers can be defined as classes of similar classes.
6. Zero is the class of all empty classes.
7. A cardinal number is the class of all classes similar (equinumerous) to a given class.
8. Similarity between classes is defined by the existence of a one-to-one correspondence.
9. Mathematical induction is derivable from the definition of natural numbers, not an independent axiom.
10. Infinity is a logical possibility and presents no inherent contradiction.
11. The actual infinite exists in mathematics; potential infinity is an inadequate substitute.
12. Real numbers are best defined as segments (Dedekind cuts) of the rational number series.
13. Continuity is a property of series, definable without appeal to intuition.
14. The calculus can be made rigorous through the arithmetization of analysis; infinitesimals are eliminable.
15. Limits involve no metaphysical notion of "approaching"; they are definable in static terms.
16. Geometry is a branch of pure mathematics when studied abstractly, apart from physical space.
17. Different geometries (Euclidean, non-Euclidean) are equally consistent; which describes physical space is empirical.
18. Points, lines, and planes are logical constructions, not intuited simples.
19. Order is a fundamental logical concept not reducible to anything simpler.
20. Asymmetrical relations are essential to mathematics and cannot be eliminated.
21. Relations are as fundamental as classes; neither can be reduced to the other.
22. Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers is logically sound and mathematically indispensable.
23. There are different sizes of infinity; some infinite sets are larger than others.
24. The power set of any set has greater cardinality than the original set.
25. The continuum is larger than the set of natural numbers (uncountably infinite).
26. The theory of types is needed to avoid logical contradictions.
27. No class can be a member of itself without generating contradiction.
28. Russell's paradox (the class of all classes not members of themselves) shows naive set theory is inconsistent.
29. Propositional functions are more fundamental than propositions.
30. Variables range over types; unrestricted variables lead to paradox.

=== INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL PHILOSOPHY ===

1. Mathematics and logic have the same scope, dealing with objects having certain properties and relations.
2. All pure mathematics is a priori and deducible from the general principles of logic.
3. The solution to the contradictions that plagued traditional infinitesimal calculus lies in the logical theory of infinite number and continuity.
4. Cardinal numbers are themselves classes of similar classes.
5. Dedekind's definition of infinite classes: a class is infinite if it is similar to a proper part of itself.
6. The axiom of infinity is required to guarantee the existence of infinite classes in the actual world.
7. Ordinal numbers are relation-types under ordinal similarity.
8. Description is a denoting phrase that denotes an object via a unique property, but the object itself is not a constituent of propositions containing the description.
9. The statement "Scott is the author of Waverley" expresses an identity, not a relation of predication.
10. Definite descriptions ("the so-and-so") are incomplete symbols that disappear on logical analysis.
11. The theory of definite descriptions resolves puzzles like "the present King of France is bald."
12. Mathematics is the science in which we never know what we are talking about nor whether what we say is true.
13. The reduction of mathematics to logic shows that mathematical certainty rests on logical certainty.
14. Kant was wrong that mathematics requires pure intuition; logic suffices.
15. The synthetic a priori is an unnecessary hypothesis; logicism eliminates it.

=== HUMAN KNOWLEDGE: ITS SCOPE AND LIMITS ===

1. Knowledge is divided into two main kinds: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.
2. Knowledge by acquaintance is direct awareness without inference (e.g., sense-data, memory-images, introspection of mental states).
3. Sense-data are the immediate objects of perception; physical objects are inferred from them.
4. Physical objects are not known by acquaintance but are logical constructions out of sense-data and sensibilia.
5. Solipsism is logically irrefutable but psychologically incredible.
6. The principle of induction cannot be proved by experience, yet it is presupposed by all empirical knowledge.
7. There are five postulates of scientific inference needed to justify induction and the belief in an external world.
8. Memory is not infallible; it provides only probable knowledge.
9. Introspective knowledge of current mental states is the most certain kind of knowledge.
10. Universals (relations such as "before," "greater than," "resembles") are known by acquaintance.
11. All a priori knowledge deals with relations of universals.
12. Logical principles (e.g., law of contradiction) are known by intuition of universals.
13. Probability, not certainty, is the guide in most empirical beliefs.
14. Scientific laws are not known to be true but to be increasingly probable as evidence accumulates.
15. Causality is not a relation between events but a functional relation between kinds of events.
16. The concept of "cause" in advanced science is replaced by functional laws.
17. Space and time are not absolute (as Newton thought) nor purely subjective (as Kant thought).
18. Matter is a logical construction from events and their causal relations.
19. The distinction between mind and matter becomes less sharp when both are constructed from neutral events.
20. Truth is not coherence nor correspondence in a naive sense.
21. A belief is true when it corresponds to a fact; a fact is whatever makes a belief true.
22. Ethical knowledge is not possible in the same sense as scientific knowledge.
23. Value judgments are expressions of desire or emotion, not statements of fact.
24. Traditional metaphysics (substance, absolute space, God) exceeds the limits of human knowledge.
25. Language misleads us into false metaphysics (e.g., subject-predicate form suggests substance).

=== THE PHILOSOPHY OF LOGICAL ATOMISM ===

1. The world consists of atomic facts, and molecular facts are built up from these.
2. Atomic facts are the simplest kind of fact; they cannot be analyzed into simpler facts.
3. Atomic propositions assert atomic facts.
4. Atomic propositions are mutually independent.
5. Atomic propositions contain no logical constants.
6. Logically proper names have meaning only by direct acquaintance.
7. A logically proper name stands for a simple particular (a logical atom).
8. Particulars (logical atoms) are the substance of the world.
9. Universals are also simple and are genuine constituents of atomic facts.
10. An atomic fact is the possession of a quality by a particular or a relation holding between particulars.
11. Molecular propositions are truth-functions of atomic propositions.
12. The only necessity is logical necessity (tautology); there is no metaphysical necessity.
13. All a priori knowledge is knowledge of tautologies.
14. Negative facts exist and are required for the truth of negative propositions.
15. General facts exist and are required for the truth of general propositions.
16. Propositions are not entities; they are incomplete symbols.
17. Ordinary proper names (Socrates, London) are not logically proper names; they are disguised descriptions.
18. We are not acquainted with physical objects or other minds.
19. Knowledge of the external world is by description, not by acquaintance.
20. Sense-data are the only particulars with which we are acquainted.
21. A physical object is a logical construction out of actual and possible sense-data (perspectives).
22. Matter is a logical fiction.
23. The self (subject) is a logical construction; there is no simple ego.
24. Mind and matter are both logical constructions from the same neutral material (events).
25. The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
26. Language misleads because its surface grammar hides logical form.
27. Logical atomism is a method, not a finished doctrine.
28. The business of philosophy is analysis until atomic propositions are reached.

=== A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY - KEY THESES ===

1. Philosophy arises from wonder and the desire to understand the world without myth.
2. The Milesian philosophers sought a single material principle underlying all things.
3. Heraclitus held that everything is in flux and that strife is the father of all things.
4. Parmenides argued that being is one, unchanging, and that plurality and motion are illusions.
5. Zeno's paradoxes were designed to defend Parmenides by showing the contradictions in motion and plurality.
6. The Atomists explained the world mechanically by atoms moving in the void.
7. Socrates sought universal definitions, especially of ethical terms, and professed ignorance.
8. Plato's theory of Forms: eternal, immutable, perfect archetypes of which sensible things are imperfect copies.
9. The Form of the Good is the source of all reality and intelligibility.
10. Aristotle rejects separate Forms; universals exist only in things (immanent realism).
11. The four causes: material, formal, efficient, final.
12. The unmoved mover is pure form, thought thinking itself, cause of all motion.
13. After Aristotle, philosophy splits into Epicureanism, Stoicism, Skepticism, and Neoplatonism.
14. Medieval philosophy is dominated by the synthesis of Christianity with Greek thought.
15. Aquinas synthesizes Aristotle with Christianity: faith and reason are compatible.
16. Ockham's nominalism: only individuals exist; universals are mental signs.
17. Ockham's razor: entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.
18. Modern philosophy begins with Descartes's quest for certainty.
19. Cogito ergo sum: I think, therefore I am—the first indubitable truth.
20. Spinoza identifies God and Nature (Deus sive Natura).
21. Locke is the founder of British empiricism: the mind at birth is a tabula rasa.
22. Berkeley denies matter: to be is to be perceived (esse est percipi).
23. Hume radicalizes empiricism: all ideas derive from impressions.
24. Causation is not necessary connection but constant conjunction and psychological expectation.
25. Kant's Copernican revolution: the mind imposes form (space, time, categories) on experience.
26. Hegel's absolute idealism: the real is rational and the rational is real.
27. Nietzsche announces the death of God and the advent of nihilism.
28. The analytic tradition seeks clarity through logical analysis and the dissolution of traditional metaphysics.

=== SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY (Multiple Works 1903-1949) ===

1. The universe is indifferent; man's significance and values are created by man himself, not bestowed by the cosmos.
2. A free man's worship consists in revering ideals he has himself created in defiance of an indifferent universe.
3. Science reveals a universe governed by impersonal laws, not by divine providence.
4. Ethical values are independent of theological premises.
5. Happiness is not found in pursuit of pleasure alone but in zestful, absorbed activity.
6. The chief obstacle to happiness is boredom and the fear of boredom.
7. Envy is one of the most potent causes of unhappiness.
8. Affection (both giving and receiving) is indispensable to happiness.
9. Work that is interesting and feels socially useful promotes happiness.
10. The habit of looking outward rather than inward increases happiness.
11. Impersonal interests (science, art, etc.) are the best cure for personal misery.
12. Sexual morality should be based on consequences for happiness, not on dogma.
13. Divorce by mutual consent should be freely available.
14. Contraception is one of the greatest liberators of women and of humanity.
15. The state has no business enforcing sexual morality between consenting adults.
16. Economic independence of women is essential to genuine marriage choice.
17. Education should aim at producing courageous, intelligent, and tolerant individuals.
18. Fear is the greatest enemy of sound education.
19. Children should be taught to think critically, not to accept authority blindly.
20. The purpose of education is not to produce obedient citizens but free individuals.
21. Nationalist propaganda in education is one of the greatest dangers of the modern world.
22. Socialism (in some form) is inevitable and desirable if democracy is to survive.
23. The power of great corporations is as dangerous as that of the state.
24. Property rights must be limited when they conflict with human welfare.
25. Anarchism is ultimately impracticable because of human aggressiveness.
26. International government is necessary to prevent war.
27. Democracy is valuable mainly as a check on tyranny, not as a positive good.
28. Nationalism is the chief political religion of the modern world and a major cause of war.
29. World federalism with limited but real sovereignty is the only long-term hope.
30. All human history is largely the history of the struggle for power.
31. The love of power is as fundamental as the sexual impulse.
32. Civilization requires the channeling, not the abolition, of the power impulse.
33. Freedom and organization are in permanent tension; both are necessary.
34. The ultimate aim of social organization should be to maximize creative impulses and minimize destructive ones.
35. The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.
