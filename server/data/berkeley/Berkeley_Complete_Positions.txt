BERKELEY POSITION STATEMENTS 

An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision

1. Distance is not immediately perceived by sight.
2. Distance is perceived mediately, by means of intervening ideas.
3. The ideas of sight and touch are entirely heterogeneous.
4. What we call "seeing distance" is actually judging distance from visual signs.
5. The connection between visual ideas and distance is learned through experience.
6. Lines and angles drawn from objects to the eye are not themselves perceived.
7. Geometrical optics cannot explain how we perceive distance.
8. The mind does not calculate distances using optic angles.
9. Convergence of the eyes provides a sensation that suggests distance.
10. The strain of accommodation in the eye contributes to near-distance judgments.
11. Confusion or blurriness of an image serves as a sign of nearness.
12. Distinctness or clarity of an image serves as a sign of distance.
13. Faintness of appearance suggests greater distance.
14. Vigor or intensity of appearance suggests nearness.
15. The number of intermediate objects affects distance judgments.
16. These various signs are combined in distance perception.
17. The connection between these signs and distance is arbitrary, not necessary.
18. Experience alone teaches us to interpret visual signs as indicating distance.
19. A person born blind and made to see would not immediately perceive distance.
20. Such a person would initially see all objects as in the eye itself.
21. The Molyneux problem is answered negatively: a newly sighted person could not recognize shapes.
22. Visible ideas and tangible ideas are specifically distinct.
23. A visible square and a tangible square are different ideas entirely.
24. They are called by the same name only through custom and association.
25. The connection between visual and tangible ideas resembles that between words and meanings.
26. Visual ideas function as a natural language signifying tangible ideas.
27. This language is universal to all sighted creatures.
28. The Author of Nature established this correlation for our benefit.
29. Light and colors are the immediate and proper objects of sight.
30. Extension and figures are perceived by sight only mediately.
31. Visible extension differs in kind from tangible extension.
32. There is no abstract general idea of extension common to sight and touch.
33. Abstract general ideas are impossible.
34. All ideas are particular and determinate.
35. Minimum visibles exist: the smallest perceivable visual points.
36. Visible extension is composed of finite collections of minima visibilia.
37. Minimum tangibles exist: the smallest perceivable tactile points.
38. Tangible extension is composed of finite collections of minima tangibilia.
39. A minimum visible is not the same thing as a minimum tangible.
40. The two minima are heterogeneous in nature.
41. One minimum visible may correspond to varying tangible magnitudes.
42. Magnitude is not immediately perceived by sight.
43. Visible magnitude and tangible magnitude are entirely distinct.
44. What we call the "real" magnitude of an object is its tangible magnitude.
45. Visible magnitude is merely a sign suggesting tangible magnitude.
46. The same visible magnitude may signify different tangible magnitudes.
47. Different visible magnitudes may signify the same tangible magnitude.
48. Judgments of tangible magnitude from visible signs are learned.
49. A near object and a far object producing the same visible magnitude appear differently.
50. The difference is due to associated ideas, not immediate perception.
51. Situation or spatial position is not immediately perceived by sight.
52. Upper and lower, right and left, are tangible determinations.
53. Visible ideas suggest tangible situations through learned association.
54. The retinal image is inverted relative to the object.
55. This inversion creates no problem for Berkeley's theory.
56. We do not perceive the retinal image at all.
57. There is no proper visible image that is either erect or inverted.
58. "Erect" and "inverted" are tangible, not visual, notions.
59. The question of why we see things upright is therefore dissolved.
60. The traditional geometrical explanations of erect vision are confused.
61. External or outward distance is not immediately seen.
62. Objects are not perceived as being "out there" through sight alone.
63. Outness is a tangible idea suggested by visual signs.
64. The moon illusion cannot be explained by optic angles alone.
65. The horizontal moon appears larger due to associated ideas.
66. Intervening terrain suggests greater distance for the horizon moon.
67. Greater suggested distance makes us judge the moon larger.
68. The zenith moon lacks these intervening distance cues.
69. The psychological explanation supersedes the geometrical one.
70. Visual ideas are in the mind, not external to it.
71. The proper objects of sight are mental ideas.
72. Touch alone gives us the idea of externality.
73. The tangible world is what we consider the real spatial world.
74. Visual ideas are signs for navigating the tangible world.
75. Experience connects the two through constant conjunction.
76. Custom and habit explain the swiftness of perceptual judgments.
77. These judgments become so automatic as to seem immediate.
78. Reflection reveals they are not truly immediate.
79. An infant does not perceive distance or magnitude as adults do.
80. Perceptual learning occurs rapidly in early life.
81. A person blind from birth has no ideas of light or color.
82. Such a person's spatial ideas are entirely tangible.
83. If made to see, everything would need to be learned anew.
84. Their visual field would initially be meaningless.
85. They would not connect visible shapes to familiar tangible objects.
86. The newly sighted would need to learn the visual language from scratch.
87. There is no common sensible perceived by both sight and touch.
88. Number is not a common sensible bridging the senses.
89. Unity and number are creatures of the mind, not sensed qualities.
90. The eye does not perceive its own operations.
91. We have no direct awareness of optical or physiological processes.
92. The ideas immediately present in vision contain no necessary reference to distance.
93. God could have established different correlations between visual and tangible ideas.
94. The existing correlations serve human preservation and convenience.
95. The visual language is divinely instituted for practical benefit.
96. Visual signs reliably indicate tangible consequences.
97. We learn to read these signs and respond appropriately.
98. Misinterpretations occur when normal correlations are disrupted.
99. Optical illusions reveal the learned and inferential nature of perception.
100. Berkeley's theory explains perception without appeal to material substance.

19. Ancient philosophers recognized this vital principle.
20. They called it by various names: fire, ether, spirit.
21. Heraclitus identified fire as the universal principle.
22. The Stoics taught that pneuma pervades all things.
23. This ethereal medium connects all parts of the universe.
24. Light and fire are manifestations of this principle.
25. The sun is the great source of ethereal fire.
26. Solar influence sustains life on earth.
27. Plants capture and concentrate the solar virtue.
28. Tar, derived from resinous trees, contains this concentrated virtue.

30. Chemistry reveals the activity of subtle principles.
31. Acids and alkalis manifest hidden active forces.
32. Fermentation displays the power of the vital spirit.

34. Mere mechanical philosophy cannot explain these processes.
35. Attraction, repulsion, and fermentation require more than matter in motion.
36. Corpuscular philosophy is insufficient.
37. Passive matter cannot account for activity in nature.
38. An active principle must be added to explain phenomena.
39. This principle is not itself material.
40. It is of a higher, more spiritual nature.
41. The pure invisible fire acts upon grosser matter.
42. It is the instrument of divine operations in nature.
43. God works through this ethereal medium.
44. The chain of causes leads upward to the divine.
45. Natural philosophy should ascend from effects to causes.
46. The order of nature reveals divine wisdom.
47. Contemplating nature elevates the mind toward God.
48. Physics properly understood leads to metaphysics.
49. The ancients combined natural and divine philosophy.

56. The One is the source of all being and intelligibility.
57. From the One proceeds Nous or Divine Intellect.
58. From Nous proceeds Soul.
59. From Soul proceeds the material world.
60. This hierarchy of being descends from unity to multiplicity.
61. Return to the One is the soul's proper aim.
62. Contemplation leads the soul upward.
63. The Ideas or Forms are the archetypes of things.
64. They exist eternally in the Divine Intellect.
65. Sensible things participate in the Forms.
66. The Forms give being and intelligibility to particulars.
67. True knowledge is knowledge of Forms, not sensibles.
68. The senses provide occasions for intellectual insight.
69. The mind rises from sensible images to intelligible realities.
70. This ascent is the proper work of philosophy.

KUCZYNSKI ON BERKELEY 

1. Berkeley argued that to be is to be perceived (esse est percipi).
2. Physical objects are identical with collections of sense-perceptions.
3. This view is called idealism because external objects are "ideas."
4. Idealism is not named for embodying optimism.
5. Berkeley had good reason for accepting idealism despite its counterintuitiveness.
6. Given empiricism, one must be an idealist to avoid total skepticism about the external world.
7. Berkeley saw this and, being an empiricist who rejected skepticism, accepted idealism.
8. According to empiricism, if you don't know it through sense-perception, you don't know it.
9. Senses cannot themselves provide assurance of their own truthfulness.
10. One cannot know through sense-perception alone that sense-perception is reliable.
11. Uncorroborated testimony is close to worthless.
12. No source can self-corroborate, including sense-perception.
13. Assurance that senses are truthful must come from some non-sensory source.
14. Empiricism denies that anything from non-sensory sources deserves credit.
15. Empiricists face two options: skepticism or redefinition of external objects.
16. Berkeley refused both to abandon empiricism and to accept skepticism.
17. He must show that sensory knowledge of external objects fits within strict empiricism.
18. This requires reinterpreting statements about external objects as statements about perceptions.
19. Phenomenalism holds that statements about external objects translate into statements about perceptions.
20. A phenomenal reduction translates sentences about the external world into sentences about perceptions.
21. Phenomenalism entails idealism.
22. If every truth about physical objects is a truth about perceptions, physical objects are nothing but perceptions.
23. Phenomenalism is false.
24. It is not possible to translate statements about rocks into statements about perceptions.
25. Phenomenalism must be accepted by any true empiricist who is not also a skeptic.
26. Our senses give us conflicting reports.
27. The same house looks big from nearby and small from far away.
28. The same room feels cool after a sauna and hot after being outside in winter.
29. Some conflicting perceptions can be dismissed as hallucinations or dreams.
30. Hallucinations and dreams don't fit into the coherent narrative of experience.
31. Most conflicting perceptions cannot be dismissed this way.
32. Garden-variety perceptions that conflict must all be accepted.
33. Given mutually discrepant perceptions, there are logically two paths.
34. Path one: some perceptions are veridical while others are not.
35. Path two: all perceptions are correct.
36. Path one fails for empiricists because there is no empirical basis for choosing which perceptions to reject.
37. Any principle for rejecting perceptions known non-sensorily abandons empiricism.
38. All garden-variety perceptions are equally credible.
39. Arbitrarily choosing which perceptions to keep would not constitute knowledge.
40. Path one would result in knowing little or nothing through sense-perception.
41. Therefore path two must be taken: all perceptions are correct.
42. Path two creates a problem: conflicting perceptions attribute incompatible properties to objects.
43. A table cannot simultaneously be square-shaped and diamond-shaped.
44. Nothing can both have and lack a given property at a given time.
45. Two conflicting perceptions can coexist even if they cannot both correctly describe one object.
46. Berkeley's solution: perceptions are not representations of objects but constituents of those objects.
47. Objects are wholly constituted by multiplicities of perceptions.
48. We know our perceptions even Cartesian skeptics concede this.
49. If perceptions are identical with their objects, we know those objects through sense-perception.
50. This solution avoids positing incoherent entities like non-equiangular equiangular objects.
51. Berkeley argued that properties are observer-dependent.
52. To elephants people appear small; to ants they appear big.
53. The external world is unknowable unless things are typically as they appear.
54. One cannot legitimately second-guess one's senses if one is an empiricist.
55. Things are knowable; it would be absurd to deny knowledge of rocks and trees.
56. Things cannot have incompatible properties.
57. If things exist independently of perception, they will have incompatible properties.
58. Things appear to have incompatible properties: big and small, hot and cold, fast and slow.
59. There is nothing incoherent in one thing appearing both big and small.
60. What is incoherent is some one thing being correctly described by incompatible representations.
61. If perceptions represent trans-perceptual objects, things have incompatible properties.
62. If perceptions are those objects, things do not have incompatible properties.
63. Therefore perceptions cannot be representations of anything.
64. Since we do know things, things must be our perceptions of them.
65. For something to exist is for it to be perceived; perception constitutes the thing.
66. Berkeley's argument fails because it ignores the relational nature of perceptual information.
67. Our senses give us relational information, not absolute information.
68. Senses tell us how things are in relation to one another and to ourselves.
69. We perceive relative heights, distances, velocities, temperatures, and masses.
70. Eyes tell us a car is going faster than another car, not that it is going 35 mph.
71. Muscles tell us a barbell weighs more than previous ones, not that it weighs 215 pounds.
72. Senses tell us where things are relative to us, not in absolute coordinates.
73. Perceptual information is relational in two senses: objects related to each other and to an egocentric coordinate system.
74. Berkeley misreported what individuals are told by their senses.
75. X's eyes don't say "Y is moving fast" but "Y is moving faster than I am."
76. Z's eyes don't say "Y is moving slow" but "Y is moving slower than I am."
77. Combined relational information is perfectly consistent.
78. "Z is moving faster than Y, and Y is moving faster than X" involves no contradiction.
79. The same analysis applies to perceived size, weight, and temperature.
80. Relational size perceptions like "Y is larger than X" and "Y is smaller than Z" are compatible.
81. Kinesthetic sensations give relational information about effort versus resistance.
82. Temperature perceptions report relations: "this water is warmer than what my hand was just in."
83. Once relational nature of perception is understood, senses do not give contradictory reports.
84. We learn actual masses, temperatures, and such despite having only relational information.
85. Measuring time by one's heartbeat would make the universe appear to slow during exercise.
86. One should not regard one's changing heartbeat as constant and the universe as changing.
87. The correct interpretation minimizes causal anomalies.
88. If taking object L as constant length implies everything else expands and contracts, L should not be the standard.
89. When perceiving change, attribute less change to whichever interpretation creates fewer anomalies.
90. Objects' actual properties are inferred from sense-perceptions, not directly perceived.
91. The rule of inference: choose the least ad hoc way of accommodating sensory data.
92. Primary properties include shape, size, density, liquidity, solidity, state of motion.
93. Secondary properties include sweetness, smell, color, and timbre.
94. For a thing to have a secondary property is for it to induce certain sensations in certain creatures.
95. For a thing to have a primary property is for it to affect conditions for occupying space-time.
96. Berkeley argued that primary properties are really secondary properties.
97. Berkeley claimed shape and size are as observer-dependent as taste and color.
98. This argument fails because perceptions give consistent relational information about primary properties.
99. The house doesn't "look small" from far away; the perception says you are far from a big house.
100. Visual images are like maps: relative size of representations indicates actual relative size.
101. Secondary properties correlate with causal differences.
102. The way meat smells indicates its ability to nourish.
103. Secondary properties track facts about microstructure.
104. "Subjective" can mean existence presupposes a subject, or it can mean embodying biasing idiosyncrasies.
105. Secondary properties are subjective only in the trivial first sense.
106. Smells track primary properties and microstructural facts otherwise hard to detect.
107. Apparent color varies with observation conditions, but so does apparent shape.
108. Under constant conditions, apparent color reliably correlates with microstructure.
109. Perceptions of primary properties have structural similarity to their objects.
110. Perceptions of secondary properties lack such internal structural correspondence.
111. Nonetheless, secondary properties belong to objects no less than primary properties do.
112. There is no inherent reason why eucalyptus couldn't smell like rotten meat and vice versa.
113. A smell-exchange would initially compromise knowledge but not permanently.
114. Comparative properties of olfactory sensations ground much smell-based knowledge.
115. What matters is that relations among sensations parallel relations among their objects.
116. Temperature is a primary property despite seeming secondary.
117. Temperature is mean kinetic energy of particles.
118. Temperature can be known through sight or hearing, not just touch.
119. Primary properties are transmodal; secondary properties are modality-specific.
120. Temperature is non-circumstantially associated with pleasant or unpleasant sensations.
121. Berkeley also argued that to be is to be conceived (esse est concipi).
122. Try to conceive of something unconceived and you have conceived it.
123. Therefore nothing unconceived can be conceived to exist.
124. This argument fails because propositions, not objects, are objects of conception.
125. Conceiving of an unconceived chicken means considering a proposition, not thinking of a specific chicken.
126. The proposition "there exists a chicken nobody is thinking of" is not absurd.
127. Berkeley claimed idealism is the commonsense view.
128. He argued any believable object-statement can be reinterpreted as a perception-statement.
129. A statement about the external world is meaningful only insofar as it affects possible observations.
130. Such statements are meaningful only to the extent they concern observations.
131. There is no observation-based reason to prefer object-statements to equivalent perception-statements.
132. To the extent a sentence demands trans-observational entities, it is meaningless.
133. Sentences are meaningful only if, when true, they make an observational difference.
134. The phenomenal reduction fails because perceptions themselves refer to trans-perceptual objects.
135. Any perception reports that spatially remote objects bear certain relations to one another.
136. In reporting spatial remoteness, perceptions imply objects are not part of one's mind.
137. To the extent perceptions are evidence, they are evidence of trans-perceptual objects.
138. Statements about objects cannot be equivalent to statements about perceptions.
139. Berkeley had two profound insights despite his failed arguments.
140. First insight: many apparent statements are really statement-forms with variables, not constants.
141. Terms like "rock" and "weighs five pounds" function as variables.
142. True statements might result from replacing variables with constants referring to perceptions.
143. Berkeley was wrong that perception-constants yield true statements.
144. Berkeley was right that object-terms function as variables.
145. Our knowledge of the world is strictly comparative.
146. Perception apprises us only of structure.
147. Anything with appropriate structure is equally consistent with our perceptions.
148. There is no observational basis for preferring one structurally adequate model over another.
149. This does not mean there is no fact about what is out there.
150. At most one of the structurally adequate possible objects can be the actual external world.
151. Berkeley was the first model-theorist.
152. Second insight: grammatical structure differs from logical form.
153. Surface structure does not reveal deep structure.
154. "The world doesn't disappear when I close my eyes" has a misleading surface form.
155. Its real meaning concerns counterfactual observations and lawful regularities.
156. "Stars move when unobserved" really means predictions based on assumed laws prove accurate.
157. Berkeley recognized that what sentences really mean differs from what their forms suggest.
158. Berkeley was the first to recognize the distinction between grammatical and logical form.
159. Berkeley's idealism was motivated by a desire to avoid skepticism while maintaining empiricism.
160. The tension between empiricism and knowledge of the external world is the core problem Berkeley addressed.
161. If empiricism is true and phenomenalism is false, skepticism follows.
162. Berkeley preferred the counterintuitive conclusion of idealism to the unacceptable conclusion of skepticism.
163. Patently deviant perceptions like hallucinations can be thrown out because they don't fit the narrative.
164. Dream-images are rejected on the same basis: they don't cohere with other perceptions.
165. Only an infinitesimal minority of sensory discrepancies involve hallucination-type misperceptions.
166. The vast majority of conflicting perceptions are all equally legitimate garden-variety perceptions.
167. Berkeley's argument requires setting aside dreams and hallucinations as a separate category.
168. The distinction between veridical and non-veridical perception cannot be drawn on purely empirical grounds.
169. Any principle for distinguishing veridical from non-veridical perception must come from outside sense-perception.
170. But empiricism forbids appealing to any such non-sensory principle.
171. This is why empiricists cannot take path one and selectively reject some perceptions.
172. Even if one arbitrarily made correct choices about which perceptions to reject, one wouldn't know it.
173. Unjustified choices cannot ground knowledge even when they happen to be correct.
174. Berkeley's argument has the form: secondary properties are mind-dependent; primary properties are like secondary; therefore primary properties are mind-dependent.
175. The argument fails because its first premise—that secondary properties are mind-dependent—is false.
176. Secondary properties are objective indicators of causal and microstructural facts.
177. The variability of apparent color no more proves color subjective than variability of apparent shape proves shape subjective.
178. Cocaine can be identified by taste more quickly than by laboratory analysis.
179. Many scientific techniques depend on reliable correlations between secondary properties and microstructure.
180. Locke wrongly concluded from color variability that secondary properties are subjective.
181. The correct conclusion is that apparent properties depend on both object and observation conditions.
182. Perceptions of primary properties are internally differentiated in ways corresponding to their objects.
183. Perceptions of secondary properties lack this structural isomorphism.
184. This difference explains why secondary properties seem more subjective, but does not make them so.
185. Visual sensations could be very different and still convey the same or more information.
186. Other species have visual sensations different from ours that contain all our information and more.
187. This doesn't entail that facts known through vision are mind-dependent.
188. The same point applies to olfaction and other senses.
189. Berkeley's esse est concipi argument conflates thinking about an object with thinking about a proposition.
190. There is no specific chicken one thinks about when one conceives of an unconceived chicken.
191. One merely entertains the proposition that some chicken or other is unthought of.
192. That proposition is perfectly coherent and possibly true.
193. Berkeley claimed that the world doesn't disappear when we close our eyes despite idealism.
194. He reconciled this with idealism through reinterpretation of such claims.
195. Statements about unobserved persistence are really about counterfactual and lawful regularities.
196. The stars example shows how apparent claims about unobserved reality reduce to claims about predictions.
197. We connect observed positions across nights by regression analysis assuming lawful trajectories.
198. Berkeley pioneered the insight that a statement's apparent meaning may differ radically from its real meaning.
199. Logical form can be perspicuously represented only by sentences grammatically unlike the original.
200. Berkeley's lasting contributions—model theory and the grammar/logic distinction—survive his failed idealism.
