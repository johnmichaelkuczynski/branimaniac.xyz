Systemof 
Theology 
(1686) 



Original 
Title: 
‘Systema 
theologicum’ 


Translated 
by 
Charles 
William 
Russell, 
1850 


Gottfried 
Wilhelm 
von 
Leibniz 
was 
born 
in 
Leipzig 
in 
1646. 
He 
entered 
the 
University 
of 
Leipzig 
as 
a 
student 
of 
philosophy 
and 
law, 
and 
in 
1666 
he 
obtained 
the 
degree 
of 
Doctor 
of 
Law 
at 
Altdorf. 
The 
following 
year 
he 
met 
the 
diplomat 
Baron 
von 
Boineburg, 
at 
whose 
suggestion 
he 
entered 
the 
diplomatic 
service 
of 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mainz. 
During 
the 
years 
of 
1672 
to 
1676, 
he 
served 
as 
the 
diplomatic 
representative 
of 
Mainz 
at 
the 
Court 
of 
Louis 


XIV. 
Healsopaid 
avisitto 
Londonand 
made 
theacquaintance 
of 
thelearned 
English 
mathematicians, 
scientists 
and 
theologians 
of 
the 
day. 
While 
at 
Paris 
he 
became 
acquainted 
with 
prominent 
representatives 
of 
Catholicism 
and 
was 
soon 
interested 
in 
the 
questions 
that 
were 
in 
dispute 
between 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants. 
In 
1676 
he 
accepted 
the 
position 
of 
librarian, 
archivist 
and 
court 
councillor 
to 
the 
Johann 
Friedrich, 
Duke 
of 
Brunswick, 
who 
was 
a 
recent 
converttoCatholicism. 
Almost 
immediately 
Leibniz 
began 
to 
exert 
himself 
in 
the 
cause 
of 
reconciliation 
between 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants. 
At 
Paris 
he 
had 
come 
to 
know 
many 
prominent 
Jesuits 
and 
Oratorians, 
and 
at 
this 
time 
he 
stared 
his 
celebrated 
correspondence 
with 
Bossuet. 
With 
the 
sanction 
of 
the 
Duke 
and 
the 
approval 
of 
Innocent 
XI, 
the 
project 
to 
find 
a 
basis 
of 
agreement 
between 
Protestants 
and 
Catholics 
in 
Hanover 
was 
inaugurated. 
Leibniz 
soon 
took 
the 
place 
of 
Molanus, 
president 
of 
the 
Hanoverian 
Consistory, 
as 
the 
representative 
of 
the 
Protestant 
claims. 
He 
tried 
to 
reconcile 
the 
Catholic 
principle 
of 
authority 
with 
the 
Protestant 
principle 
of 
free 
enquiry. 
He 



favoured 
a 
species 
of 
syncretic 
Christianity 
first 
proposed 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Helmstadt, 
which 
adopted 
for 
its 
creed 
an 
eclectic 
formula 
made 
up 
of 
the 
dogmas 
supposed 
to 
have 
been 
held 
by 
the 
primitive 
Church. 
At 
length, 
he 
drew 
up 
a 
statement 
of 
Catholic 
doctrine, 
entitled 
“Systema 
Theologicum”, 
which 
met 
the 
approval 
not 
only 
of 
Bishop 
Spinola 
of 
Wiener-Neustadt, 
who 
conducted 
the 
case 
for 
the 
Catholics, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
Pope, 
the 
Cardinals, 
the 
General 
oftheJesuits, 
theMaster 
oftheSacredPalaceandvariousothers. 


Leibniz 
was 
actuated 
as 
much 
by 
patriotic 
motives 
as 
he 
was 
by 
religious 
reasons. 
He 
saw 
clearly 
that 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
sources 
of 
weakness 
in 
the 
German 
States 
was 
the 
lack 
of 
religious 
unity 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
toleration. 
The 
role 
he 
played 
was 
that 
of 
a 
diplomat 
rather 
than 
that 
of 
a 
theologian. 
However, 
his 
correspondence 
with 
Bossuet 
and 
Pelisson 
and 
his 
acquaintance 
with 
many 
prominent 
Catholics 
produced 
a 
change 
in 
his 
attitude 
towards 
the 
Church, 
and, 
although 
he 
adopted 
for 
his 
own 
creed 
a 
kind 
of 
eclectic 
rationalistic 
Christianity, 
he 
ceased 
in 
1696 
to 
attend 
Protestantservices.

SYSTEM 
OF 
THEOLOGY. 



AFTER 
A 
LONG 
and 
mature 
examination 
of 
the 
controversies 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
religion, 
in 
which 
I 
have 
invoked 
the 
Divine 
assistance, 
and 
divested 
myself, 
as 
far, 
perhaps, 
as 
is 
possible 
for 
man, 
of 
party-feeling, 
as 
though 
I 
came 
from 
a 
new 
world, 
a 
neophyte 
unattached 
to 
any 
party, 
I 
have 
at 
length 
fixed 
in 
my 
own 
mind, 
and, 
after 
full 
consideration, 
resolved 
to 
adopt, 
the 
following 
principles, 
which, 
to 
an 
unprejudiced 
man, 
will 
appear 
to 
carry 
with 
them 
the 
recommendation 
of 
sacred 
Scripture, 
of 
pious 
antiquity, 
and 
evenofrightreasonand 
theauthorityofhistory. 


In 
the 
first 
place, 
then, 
I 
believe 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
Most 
Perfect 
Substance, 
one, 
eternal, 
omnipresent, 
omniscient, 
and 
almighty, 
which 
we 
call 
GOD; 
by 
whom 
all 
other 
things 
have 
been 
created 
in 
a 
most 
beautiful 
order, 
and 
are 
preserved 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
continual 
production. 
The 
doctrine, 
therefore, 
of 
those 
who 
conceive 
God 
to 
be 
corporeal, 
finite, 
circumscribed 
by 
place, 
and 
ignorant 
of 
future 
contingent 
events, 
whether 
absolute 
or 
conditional, 
is 
utterly 
intolerable; 
and 
hence 
I 
strongly 
reprobate 
certain 
Anti-
trinitarians 
and 
kindred 
sectaries, 
who 
have 
not 
spared 
even 
this 
first 
principleof 
faith,andwhoentertain 
mostunworthyconceptionsofGod. 


Now 
this 
Supreme 
Intelligence 
created, 
in 
order 
to 
his 
own 
glory, 
other 
intellectual 
beings, 
whom 
He 
governs 
with 
most 
perfect 
justice; 
insomuch 
that 
any 
one 
who 
could 
understand 
the 
whole 
order 
of 
the 
Divine 
economy, 
would 
find 
therein 
a 
model 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
form 
of 
commonwealth, 
in 
which 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
a 
philosopher 
to 
discover 
a 
single 
want, 
or 
tosupplyany 
thingindesire. 



Hence 
we 
must 
avoid 
those 
opinions 
which 
represent 
God 
as 
a 
certain 
Supreme 
Power, 
from 
which 
all 
things, 
although 
they 
emanate, 
yet 
emanate 
indiscriminately, 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
necessary 
existence, 
and 
without 
any 
selection 
of 
the 
beautiful 
or 
the 
good; 
as 
if 
these 
notions 
were 
arbitrary, 
or 
had 
no 
foundation 
in 
nature, 
but 
only 
in 
the 
imagination 
of 
men. 
For 
God 
is 
not 
only 
the 
supreme 
Creator 
of 
all 
existing 
things, 
but 
He 
is 
also 
the 
beneficent 
Prince 
of 
all 
intellectual 
beings, 
and 
in 
some 
sense 
their 
Legislator; 
— 
a 
Legislator, 
however, 
who 
requires 
nothing 
from 
his 
subjects 
but 
souls 
actuated 
by 
sincere 
affection, 
animated 
with 
a 
right 
intention, 
persuaded 
of 
the 
beneficence, 
the 
consummate 
justice, 
the 
beauty, 
and 
goodness, 
of 
the 
most 
amiable 
of 
all 
lords; 
and 
therefore, 
not 
merely 
fearing 
his 
power 
as 
that 
of 
a 
supreme 
and 
all-seeing 
Monarch, 
but 
also 
confiding 
in 
his 
benevolence, 
and, 
in 
fine, 
glowing 
with 
the 
love 
of 
Him 
above 
all 
things 
— 
a 
sentiment 
which 
comprises 
all 
therest. 


Forthose 
who 
are 
impressed 
withsuchsentiments, 
who 
fix 
them 
deeply 
in 
their 
souls, 
and 
evince 
in 
their 
lives 
the 
sincerity 
of 
their 
convictions, 
never 
murmur 
against 
the 
Divine 
will; 
being 
well 
assured 
that 
all 
things 
must 
conduce 
to 
the 
good 
of 
those 
who 
love 
God: 
and, 
as 
they 
are 
content 
with 
the 
past, 
so, 
in 
what 
concerns 
the 
future, 
they 
seek 
always 
to 
act 
in 
conformity 
with 
that 
which 
they 
presume 
to 
be 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
Now 
all 
that 
God, 
in 
proposing 
rewards 
and 
punishments, 
requires 
of 
each 
of 
us, 
is, 
that 
he 
labour 
for 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
his 
own 
especial 
duties; 
that, 
like 
the 
first 
man, 
he 
cultivate 
the 
garden 
in 
which 
he 
has 
been 
placed, 
and 
that, 
in 
imitation 
of 
the 
divine 
goodness, 
he 
diffuse 
his 
beneficence 
on 
every 
object 
around 
him, 
but 
especially, 
within 
the 
due 
proportions 
which 
justice 
requires, 
on 
all 
those 
with 
whom 
he 
may 
be 
thrown 
into 
intercourse, 
as 
being 
his 
neighbours; 
because, 
among 
the 
creatures 
which 
come 
within 
our 
sphere, 
there 
is 
none 
moreexcellentthan 
man,nonewhoseperfection 
ismoregratefultoGod. 



If, 
therefore, 
all 
intelligent 
beings 
always 
thought 
and 
acted 
in 
accordance 
with 
these 
principles, 
they 
would 
unquestionably 
live 
happily. 
But 
as 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
this 
neither 
always 
is, 
nor 
has 
been, 
the 
case, 
a 
question 
arises, 
whence 
it 
is 
that 
sin, 
and 
through 
sin, 
misery, 
entered 
into 
the 
world; 
for 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
God, 
the 
author 
of 
all 
good, 
cannot 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
sin. 
It 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind, 
therefore, 
that 
in 
all 
creatures, 
however 
exalted, 
there 
is, 
antecedent 
to 
all 
sin, 
a 
certain 
inborn 
and 
original 
finiteness, 
which 
renders 
them 
liable 
to 
fall; 
and 
in 
this 
sense 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
the 
sentiment 
which 
Job 
appears 
to 
have 
meant 
to 
convey, 
that 
not 
even 
the 
holiest 
angels 
are 
free 
from 
stain, 
that 
is, 
from 
imperfection. 
Nor 
is 
this 
incompatible 
with 
the 
existence 
of 
original 
justice 
in 
“God’s 
image 
because 
the 
rational 
creature, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
perfect, 
derives 
this 
perfection 
from 
the 
Divine 
image; 
but 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
limited 
and 
devoid 
of 
certain 
perfections, 
so 
far 
does 
it 
partake 
of 
privation, 
or 
of 
nothing. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
purport 
of 
St. 
Augustine’s 
opinion, 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
evil 
arises 
not 
from 
God, 
but 
from 
nothing; 
that 
is, 
not 
from 
the 
positive, 
but 
from 
the 
privative; 
— 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
from 
that 
finiteness 
ofcreaturesofwhichwehave 
already 
spoken. 


And 
although 
it 
would 
have 
been 
possible 
for 
God 
to 
have 
created 
only 
such 
intelligences 
as, 
though 
they 
possessed 
the 
power 
of 
falling, 
yet, 
in 
point 
of 
fact, 
never 
would 
fall, 
nevertheless 
it 
pleased 
his 
inscrutable 
wisdom 
to 
create 
this 
present 
order 
of 
things, 
wherein, 
from 
among 
countless 
others 
equally 
possible, 
certain 
possible 
intelligences, 
which, 
in 
the 
notion 
of 
their 
possibility,orinthe 
ideaof 
them 
which 
exists 
in 
God, 
involvea 
certain 
series 
of 
free 
actions 
and 
divine 
helps 
— 
of 
faith, 
charity, 
eternal 
happiness, 
or 
the 
contrary 
— 
are 
selected, 
and 
admitted 
to 
existence, 
or 
created: 
— 
as, 
for 
instance, 
Adam, 
who 
was 
to 
be 
exiled 
from 
Paradise; 
Peter, 
prince 
of 
the 
apostles,tobe 
a 
renegade, 
aconfessor, 
andamartyr; 
Judas,a 
traitor, 
&c. 
And 
this, 
doubtless, 
because 
God 
knew 
how 
to 
convert 
this 
partial 
and 
particular 



evil, 
the 
occurrence 
of 
which 
He 
foresaw 
and 
permitted, 
into 
a 
good 
far 
greater 
than 
should 
have 
existed 
without 
this 
evil; 
so 
that 
in 
the 
end, 
the 
present 
order 
should, 
as 
a 
whole, 
be 
more 
perfect 
than 
all 
others. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
the 
fall 
of 
Adam 
was 
corrected, 
with 
an 
immeasurable 
gain 
of 
perfection, 
by 
the 
Incarnation 
of 
the 
Word, 
and 
the 
treason 
of 
Judas 
by 
the 
Redemptionofthehuman 
race. 


Hence 
when 
some 
of 
the 
angels 
fell, 
through 
an 
impulse, 
as 
it 
appears, 
of 
pride; 
and 
when 
afterwards 
the 
first 
man, 
under 
the 
seduction 
of 
the 
evil 
angel, 
fell 
through 
concupiscence; 
— 
for 
the 
former 
is 
a 
sin 
characteristic 
of 
the 
diabolical, 
the 
latter 
of 
the 
animal 
nature; 
— 
original 
sin 
invaded 
the 
human 
race 
in 
the 
person 
of 
our 
first 
parent; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
certain 
depraved 
quality 
was 
contracted, 
which, 
from 
the 
darkness 
of 
the 
intellect 
and 
the 
predominance 
of 
the 
senses 
which 
it 
induces, 
renders 
men 
slothful 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
good, 
and 
prompt 
in 
the 
commission 
of 
evil 
actions. 
And 
although 
the 
soul, 
as 
it 
emanates 
from 
God, 
(for 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
transmission 
of 
souls 
is 
unintelligible) 
is 
pure, 
yet, 
through 
the 
sin 
of 
our 
parents, 
it 
is 
corrupted 
by 
its 
very 
union 
with 
the 
body; 
in 
other 
words, 
by 
its 
connexion 
with 
external 
things, 
original 
sin, 
or 
a 
disposition 
to 
sin, 
is 
produced 
in 
the 
soul; 
although 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
conceive 
any 
moment 
at 
which 
it 
was 
itself 
pure 
from 
stain, 
and 
was 
doomed 
to 
be 
imprisoned 
in 
an 
infected 
body. 
And 
thus 
were 
all 
made 
“children 
of 
wrath,”“concluded 
under 
sin,” 
and 
doomed 
to 
inevitable 
perdition, 
unless 
preserved 
by 
a 
great 
grace 
of 
God. 
We 
are 
not, 
however, 
to 
extend 
the 
effect 
of 
original 
sin 
so 
far 
as 
to 
hold 
that 
children 
who 
have 
committed 
no 
actual 
sin 
will 
be 
damned 
— 
an 
opinion 
which 
many 
maintain; 
for, 
under 
God, 
who 
is 
a 
just 
judge, 
no 
one 
can 
be 
condemned 
to 
miserywithoutafaultof 
his 
own. 


Actual 
sins 
are 
of 
two 
kinds; 
some 
venial, 
which 
must 
be 
expiated 
by 
temporal 
chastisement, 
others 
mortal, 
which 
merit 
eternal 
perdition. 
And 
this 



division 
of 
sin 
not 
only 
is 
an 
ancient 
one, 
but 
also 
appears 
perfectly 
consonant 
with 
the 
divine 
justice; 
nor 
can 
I 
commend 
the 
views 
of 
those, 
who, 
like 
the 
Stoics, 
regard 
all 
sins 
as 
almost 
equal, 
or 
all 
alike 
worthy 
of 
the 
extreme 
punishment 
of 
eternal 
damnation. 
Now 
those 
sins 
appear 
specially 
to 
merit 
the 
name 
of 
mortal, 
which 
are 
committed 
with 
a 
perverse 
intention, 
and 
against 
the 
express 
dictate 
of 
conscience, 
and 
the 
principles 
of 
virtue 
implanted 
in 
the 
mind. 
For 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
those 
who 
depart 
from 
this 
life 
at 
enmity 
with 
God 
(as 
they 
are 
no 
longer 
recalled 
by 
external 
impressions 
of 
sense,) 
persevere 
in 
the 
course 
which 
they 
have 
commenced, 
and 
retain 
the 
state 
of 
mind 
in 
which 
they 
were 
surprised, 
and 
that, 
by 
this 
very 
fact, 
they 
are 
separated 
from 
God; 
whence, 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
consequence, 
they 
fall 
into 
the 
supreme 
misery 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
thus 
become, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
instrument 
of 
theirown 
damnation. 


Now 
all 
men, 
being 
born 
in 
sin, 
and 
not 
as 
yet 
regenerated 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
are 
wont, 
when 
they 
have 
attained 
the 
use 
of 
reason, 
to 
fall 
into 
mortal 
sins, 
at 
least 
unless 
they 
are 
withheld 
by 
some 
singular 
favour 
of 
God; 
for, 
by 
the 
voice 
of 
conscience, 
all 
are 
admonished 
of 
the 
distinction 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
and 
yet 
are 
occasionally 
overcome 
by 
the 
passions. 
And 
consequently 
the 
whole 
human 
race 
would 
perish, 
had 
not 
God, 
from 
eternity, 
formed 
a 
design 
for 
its 
redemption 
or 
expiation, 
worthy 
of 
his 
mercy, 
as 
well 
as 
his 
unspeakable 
wisdom, 
which 
He 
executed 
in 
his 
own 
season. 


For 
we 
must 
hold 
as 
a 
certain 
principle, 
that 
“God 
desireth 
not 
the 
death 
of 
the 
sinner,” 
but 
“will 
have 
all 
men 
to 
be 
saved;” 
— 
not, 
it 
is 
true, 
with 
an 
absolute 
and 
irresistible 
will, 
but 
with 
a 
will 
ordered 
and 
limited 
by 
certain 
laws; 
— 
and 
consequently, 
that 
He 
assists 
each 
individual 
as 
far 
as 
is 
consistentwiththeorderofhiswisdomandjustice. 



The 
principles 
hitherto 
stated 
are 
almost 
all 
evident 
from 
the 
light 
of 
reason 
itself; 
but 
it 
is 
only 
from 
the 
revelation 
of 
God 
that 
we 
could 
have 
learnt 
what 
was 
the 
hidden 
economy 
of 
the 
Divine 
counsel 
in 
the 
restoration 
ofthehuman 
race. 


We 
must 
call 
to 
mind, 
therefore, 
that 
God 
is 
not 
only 
the 
First 
Substance, 
the 
Author 
and 
Preserver 
of 
all 
others, 
but 
that 
He 
is 
also 
the 
most 
perfect 
Intelligence; 
and 
that,inthis 
relation, 
He 
is 
invested 
with 
a 
moral 
quality, 
and 
enters 
into 
a 
certain 
society 
with 
other 
intelligences, 
over 
all 
of 
whom, 
collected 
into 
a 
most 
perfect 
commonwealth, 
which 
we 
may 
call 
“the 
City 
of 
God,” 
Hepresides,asasuprememonarchover 
his 
subjects. 


God, 
therefore, 
not 
only 
acts 
by 
that 
general 
and 
hidden 
will 
by 
which 
He 
governs, 
according 
to 
certain 
fixed 
rules, 
the 
entire 
machine 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
bywhich 
He 
concurswithalltheactionsofintelligentbeings;butalso,in 
his 
capacity 
of 
legislator, 
declares, 
and 
sanctions 
by 
rewards 
and 
punishments, 
his 
particular 
and 
public 
will 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
acts 
of 
intelligent 
beings 
and 
the 
government 
of 
his 
city; 
and 
for 
this 
purpose 
He 
has 
institutedrevelations. 


Now, 
revelation 
must 
be 
invested 
with 
certain 
notes 
(commonly 
called 
motives 
of 
credibility), 
from 
which 
it 
may 
appear, 
that 
what 
is 
contained 
therein 
and 
declared 
to 
us, 
is 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
not 
an 
illusion 
of 
the 
evil 
genius, 
or 
a 
false 
interpretation 
of 
our 
own; 
and 
if 
any 
revelation 
be 
destitute 
of 
these 
notes, 
we 
cannot 
embrace 
it 
with 
security: 
with 
this 
restriction, 
however, 
that 
sometimes, 
in 
a 
case 
of 
doubt, 
when 
the 
mandate 
in 
itself 
is 
not 
at 
variance 
with 
reason 
or 
with 
any 
previous 
revelation, 
and 
is 
supported 
by 
probable 
reasons, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
obey 
it 
than 
to 
expose 
ourselves 
to 
danger 
of 
sin. 
In 
this, 
however, 
we 
must 
be 
cautious 
lest 
fear 
should 
degenerate 
into 
superstition, 
and 
credit 
be 
given 
to 
every 
“old 
wives’” 
tale. 
For 
it 
would 
be 
unworthy 
the 
Divine 
Wisdom 
to 
omit 
a 
precaution 
which 
no 
prudent 



legislator 
neglects, 
that 
of 
notifying 
sufficiently 
the 
will 
of 
the 
lawgiver. 
Hence 
faith 
is 
not 
lightly 
to 
be 
given 
to 
lots, 
to 
visions, 
or 
to 
dreams, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
to 
auguries, 
omens, 
and 
such 
other 
trifles, 
which 
(under 
the 
notion 
that 
theyaresignsof 
the 
Divinecounsel)weabsurdlycall 
divinations. 


As 
right 
reason, 
therefore, 
is 
the 
natural 
interpreter 
of 
God, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that, 
before 
any 
other 
interpreters 
of 
God 
be 
recognised, 
reason 
should 
be 
able 
to 
pronounce 
upon 
their 
authority; 
but 
when 
they 
have 
once, 
so 
to 
speak, 
established 
their 
legitimate 
character, 
reason 
itself 
must 
thenceforward 
submit 
to 
faith. 
And 
this 
may 
be 
understood 
from 
the 
example 
of 
a 
governor 
who 
commands 
in 
a 
province 
or 
garrison 
as 
the 
representative 
of 
his 
prince; 
he 
will 
not 
lightly, 
nor 
without 
cautious 
scrutiny 
of 
his 
credentials, 
yield 
up 
his 
authority 
to 
the 
successor 
who 
may 
be 
sent 
to 
replace 
him, 
lest 
an 
enemy 
steal 
in 
under 
this 
guise. 
But 
the 
moment 
he 
recognises 
his 
master’s 
will, 
he 
will 
at 
once, 
without 
dispute, 
submit 
himself 
and 
the 
entire 
garrison 
to 
the 
newauthority. 


Nevertheless, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
evidences 
of 
human 
faith, 
or 
motives 
of 
credibility, 
there 
is 
further 
required 
a 
certain 
internal 
operation 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
which 
invests 
it 
with 
the 
title 
of 
divine 
faith, 
and 
confirms 
the 
mind 
in 
the 
truth; 
and 
hence 
it 
is 
that 
faith 
may 
exist 
where 
there 
is 
not, 
and 
perhaps 
never 
has 
been, 
any 
advertence 
to 
these 
motives 
drawn 
from 
human 
reason; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
at 
all 
times, 
nor 
for 
all 
persons, 
to 
enter 
into 
an 
analysis 
of 
faith, 
nor 
is 
every 
person 
equal 
to 
the 
difficulty 
of 
such 
an 
examination. 
The 
very 
nature 
of 
true 
faith, 
however, 
necessarily 
supposes 
that 
those 
who, 
in 
the 
fear 
of 
God, 
attentively 
examine 
the 
truth, 
should 
be 
able, 
when 
occasion 
requires, 
to 
institute 
an 
analysis 
of 
its 
motives; 
if 
it 
were 
not 
so, 
the 
Christian 
religion 
would 
have 
nothing 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
a 
false 
system, 
speciouslyadorned. 



All 
the 
notes 
of 
divine 
revelation, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
one 
— 
the 
excellence 
of 
the 
doctrine 
itself 
— 
may 
be 
resolved 
into 
that 
of 
confirmation 
by 
miracle, 
or 
by 
some 
wondrous 
and 
inimitable 
circumstance, 
or 
event, 
or 
coincidence, 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
ascribe 
to 
chance. 
For 
this 
is 
an 
especial 
sign 
that 
the 
admonition 
is 
from 
Providence. 
Now 
this 
is 
peculiarly 
the 
effect 
of 
prophecy; 
for 
to 
predict 
future 
events 
accurately 
and 
circumstantially 
exceeds 
not 
only 
all 
human, 
but 
even 
all 
created 
powers. 
Hence 
we 
are 
bound 
to 
give 
credit 
both 
to 
the 
prophet 
himself 
and 
to 
the 
person 
whose 
coming 
is 
found 
to 
verify 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
prophecy. 
So, 
also, 
if 
any 
one 
perform 
other 
wonderful 
and, 
humanly 
speaking, 
incredible 
works,wemustrecognisehimasaidedbyasuperhumanpower. 


Furthermore, 
if 
miracles 
of 
this 
character, 
though 
performed 
long 
since, 
be 
attested 
by 
those 
arguments 
by 
which, 
in 
other 
cases, 
the 
truth 
of 
historical 
facts 
is 
legitimately 
proved, 
we 
are 
bound 
to 
believe 
them, 
just 
as 
well 
as 
if 
they 
were 
performed 
to-day. 
For, 
even 
in 
the 
management 
of 
our 
human 
affairs, 
how 
many 
things 
do 
we 
admit 
as 
undoubted 
(and 
that 
with 
perfect 
propriety 
and 
prudence) 
which 
we 
have 
neither 
tested 
by 
our 
senses, 
nor 
are 
able 
to 
prove 
by 
demonstrative 
arguments! 
And, 
indeed, 
as 
St. 
Augustine 
well 
shews 
in 
his 
book 
On 
the 
Utility 
of 
Believing, 
most 
of 
our 
actions, 
even 
in 
the 
affairs 
of 
common 
life, 
rest 
on 
faith, 
and 
yet 
are 
not 
on 
that 
account 
less 
successful 
in 
their 
issue, 
or 
less 
prudent 
in 
their 
design. 
Nor 
can 
we 
hesitate 
to 
hold 
as 
certain, 
that 
the 
Providence 
which 
rules 
the 
universe 
will 
never 
permit 
falsehood 
to 
invest 
itself 
with 
all 
the 
distinctive 
badges 
of 
truth, 
and,sotospeak,her 
official 
robes. 


The 
brevity 
which 
we 
propose 
to 
ourselves 
does 
not 
permit 
our 
entering, 
in 
this 
place, 
into 
the 
evidences 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
Christian 
religion. 
Many 
eminent 
men 
have 
already 
ably 
executed 
this 
task; 
as, 
for 
example, 
Origen, 
Arnobius, 
Lactantius, 
Eusebius, 
Cyril, 
Theodoret, 
St. 
Thomas 
in 
his 
work 



Against 
the 
Gentiles; 
and, 
more 
recently, 
Steuchus, 
Mornay, 
Grotius, 
Huet; 
and 
although 
wemight 
beable 
to 
add 
muchto 
what 
theyhave 
written 
(for 
the 
various 
evidences 
of 
truth 
are 
innumerable), 
yet 
we 
are 
far 
from 
seeking 
to 
detractfromtheirmerit. 


The 
sacred 
monuments 
of 
Christians 
teach 
that 
the 
Supreme 
God 
(whose 
unity 
is 
established 
by 
the 
evidence 
of 
reason 
itself) 
is 
nevertheless 
three 
in 
Persons, 
and 
consequently 
(a 
mystery 
which 
surpasses 
all 
reason) 
that, 
in 
one 
only 
God, 
there 
are 
three 
Persons 
of 
the 
Divinity; 
that 
these, 
to 
human 
comprehension, 
may 
very 
fitly 
be 
called 
the 
Father, 
the 
Son 
or 
Word, 
and 
the 
Holy 
Ghost; 
and 
that 
the 
Son 
is 
born 
of 
the 
Father, 
and 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
proceeds, 
according 
to 
the 
Latins, 
from 
both 
the 
Father 
and 
the 
Son, 
or, 
according 
to 
the 
Greeks, 
from 
the 
Father 
through 
the 
Son 
(and 
that 
as 
from 
one 
principle). 


This, 
however, 
must 
be 
understood 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
all 
suspicion 
of 
Tritheism; 
and 
therefore, 
when 
it 
is 
said, 
“the 
Father 
is 
God, 
the 
Son 
is 
God, 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
is 
God, 
and 
these 
three 
are 
different 
from 
one 
another” 
(so 
that 
the 
Father 
is 
not 
the 
Son 
or 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
nor 
the 
Son 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
or 
the 
Father, 
nor 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
the 
Father 
or 
the 
Son), 
it 
must 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
nevertheless 
there 
are 
not 
three 
Gods, 
but 
only 
one 
God,thoughthreeinPersons. 


The 
Anti-trinitarians, 
indeed, 
insist 
that 
this 
is 
a 
contradiction, 
and 
that 
the 
plural 
number 
has 
no 
other 
force 
but 
to 
express 
that 
the 
three 
Beings, 
distinct 
from 
one 
another, 
each 
of 
whom 
is 
God, 
are 
three 
Gods, 
and 
that 
things 
which 
aredistinctinnumbercannotbeonein 
number. 


But 
they 
should 
reflect 
that 
the 
Church 
does 
not 
assert 
of 
the 
Father, 
for 
instance, 
or 
of 
the 
Son, 
that 
He 
is 
three 
in 
Persons, 
but 
that 
He 
is 
one 
Person 
of 
the 
Divinity; 
hence 
the 
multiplication 
of 
Persons 
does 
not 
involve 
the 
multiplication 
of 
God, 
three 
in 
Persons; 
nor, 
therefore, 
does 
the 
Trinity 
of 



Persons 
imply 
three 
Gods. 
Moreover, 
a 
person, 
generally, 
is 
a 
substance 
numerically 
one 
and 
incommunicable; 
and, 
in 
God, 
it 
essentially 
involves 
a 
relation, 
and, 
together 
with 
its 
correlates, 
constitutes 
an 
absolute 
substance 
numerically 
one. 
There 
are, 
therefore, 
three 
singular 
substances, 
and 
one 
absolute 
relation 
which 
embraces 
these, 
and 
whose 
undivided 
nature 
is 
communicated 
to 
each. 
Of 
this 
we 
may 
discover 
some 
faint 
resemblance 
in 
theoperations 
ofourownmind, 
consideringand 
lovingitself. 


It 
was 
by 
this 
illustration, 
adapted 
to 
our 
comprehension, 
that 
the 
ancients 
were 
wont, 
and, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
judiciously, 
to 
explain 
this 
mystery, 
viz. 
by 
the 
analogy 
of 
the 
three 
chief 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind 
or 
requisites 
of 
action, 
namely, 
Power, 
Knowledge, 
and 
Will; 
Power 
being 
ascribed 
to 
the 
Father, 
as 
the 
source 
of 
the 
Divinity; 
Wisdom 
to 
the 
Son, 
as 
the 
Word 
of 
the 
mind; 
and 
Will 
or 
Love 
to 
the 
Holy 
Ghost: 
for, 
from 
the 
Virtue 
or 
Power 
of 
the 
Divine 
Essence 
spring 
Ideas 
of 
things, 
or 
Truths; 
these 
Wisdom 
embraces; 
and 
thus, 
in 
the 
end, 
they 
become, 
according 
to 
their 
several 
perfection, 
objects 
of 
the 
Will:anillustration 
whichalso

Persons. 


As 
it 
had 
been 
decreed, 
therefore, 
in 
the 
eternal 
secrets 
of 
the 
Divine 
counsel, 
that 
one 
of 
the 
Persons 
of 
the 
Divinity 
should 
take 
upon 
Him 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
creature, 
and, 
in 
a 
peculiar 
manner, 
adapted 
to 
our 
comprehension, 
should 
govern, 
like 
a 
king, 
familiarly 
and 
openly, 
the 
city 
of 
God, 
or 
the 
commonwealth 
of 
intelligences, 
it 
pleased 
the 
only-begotten 
Son 
of 
the 
Father 
to 
take 
this 
office 
upon 
Himself, 
the 
Word 
of 
the 
Divine 
Mind 
alreadyeminentlycontaininginitselftheideas 
ornaturesof 
creatures. 


And 
He 
assumed 
the 
nature 
of 
man, 
not 
alone 
because 
in 
man 
the 
superior 
and 
inferior 
natures 
meet, 
as 
if 
upon 
a 
common 
boundary, 
but 
also 
because 
there 
is 
no 
other 
more 
worthy 
means 
of 
attaining 
the 
expiation 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
which 
was 
the 
first 
care 
of 
God; 
and 
it 
seemed 
fitting 
that 
the 
Son 
made 
Man 
should 
Himself 
exemplify 
every 
virtue, 
and 
should 
triumph 
by 
perfect 



humility 
and 
patience, 
before 
man 
should 
be 
crowned 
with 
the 
incredible 
glorytowhichheisthuselevated. 


We 
learn, 
therefore, 
from 
Divine 
revelation, 
that, 
when 
the 
pre-ordained 
time 
arrived, 
the 
Word, 
or 
only-begotten 
Son 
of 
God, 
assumed 
our 
entire 
human 
nature, 
consisting 
of 
soul 
and 
body; 
and 
that, 
while 
He 
sojourned 
on 
earth, 
He 
acted 
as 
man, 
in 
every 
thing 
except 
sin, 
from 
which 
He 
was 
exempt, 
and 
miracles, 
by 
which 
He 
shewed 
Himself 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
man. 
And 
He 
was 
called 
Jesus, 
surnamed 
Christ, 
as 
being 
the 
Anointed 
of 
the 
Lord, 
or 
the 
King 
orMessiah, 
the 
Restorer 
of 
thehuman 
race 
long 
foretold 
by 
theoraclesoftheprophets. 


The 
holy 
Fathers 
admirably 
illustrate 
the 
mystery 
of 
the 
Incarnation 
by 
the 
analogy 
of 
the 
union 
of 
soul 
and 
body: 
“for 
as 
soul 
and 
body 
is 
one 
man, 
so 
God 
and 
Man 
is 
one 
Christ.” 
The 
illustration, 
however, 
is 
imperfect, 
for 
the 
soul 
partakes 
in 
some 
things 
of 
the 
imperfections 
of 
the 
body, 
while 
the 
Divine 
Nature 
cannot 
admit 
imperfection. 
Still 
the 
words 
‘person’ 
and 
‘nature’ 
are 
very 
fitly 
applied; 
for 
as 
a 
plurality 
of 
Persons 
possess 
the 
one 
nature 
of 
the 
Divinity, 
so, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
Person 
of 
the 
Divinity 
embracesapluralityof 
natures,thedivineandhuman. 


Nor 
do 
I 
see 
any 
reason 
for 
the 
abhorrence 
which 
many 
sectaries, 
both 
ancient 
and 
modern, 
exhibit 
for 
these 
opinions. 
For 
if 
one 
weigh 
the 
matter 
fairly, 
he 
will 
find 
that 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
on 
the 
Trinity 
and 
Incarnation 
are 
safe, 
and 
that 
those 
of 
her 
adversaries 
are 
replete 
with 
danger. 
Because 
the 
Church 
defines 
that 
only 
one 
absolute 
substance 
is 
to 
be 
adored, 
viz. 
the 
supreme, 
omniscient, 
and 
almighty 
God; 
and 
neither 
in 
the 
Word, 
nor 
in 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
nor 
in 
the 
man 
Jesus, 
does 
she 
honour 
with 
supreme 
adoration 
aught 
elsethanthisoneeternalBeing. 


The 
practice 
of 
the 
Church, 
therefore, 
is 
blameless, 
if 
it 
be 
but 
duly 
inculcated 
upon 
the 
people; 
nor 
does 
there 
appear 
any 
reason 
why 
we 
should 



regard 
as 
unworthy 
of 
God, 
either 
this 
internal 
undivided 
Trinity, 
or 
the 
external 
assumption 
of 
the 
human 
nature, 
which 
receives 
perfectionsfrom 
the 
Godhead, 
but 
doesnotreturnits 
ownimperfectionsthereto. 


Now 
the 
Arians, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
regard 
the 
Son 
of 
God 
merely 
as 
the 
first 
of 
creatures, 
and 
some 
of 
them 
under 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
understand 
the 
angels; 
and 
yet 
they 
scruple 
not 
to 
worship, 
with 
divine 
honours, 
what 
they 
thus 
regard 
as 
a 
creature. 
The 
Photinians, 
regarding 
Christ 
as 
a 
simple 
man, 
make 
Him 
an 
adoptive 
Son 
of 
God, 
and 
yet 
adore 
this 
factitious 
and 
subordinate 
Deity 
— 
a 
doctrine 
which 
certainly 
appears 
to 
coincide 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Pagans; 
and, 
if 
their 
hypothesis 
be 
once 
admitted, 
Francis 
Davidis 
acted 
more 
consistently 
in 
denying 
all 
adoration 
to 
one 
whom 
he 
professed 
to 
be 
a 
mereman; 
although 
how 
slightthe 
interval 
between 
this 
opinion 
and 
that 
ofMahomet 
himself! 


Withregardto 
the 
mode 
of 
the 
union 
ofnatures,many 
subtle 
questions 
are 
raised, 
which 
it 
would 
have 
been 
better 
to 
have 
left 
untouched; 
among 
others, 
that 
respecting 
the 
“communion 
of 
properties,” 
namely, 
whether, 
and 
how 
far, 
the 
properties 
of 
one 
nature 
may 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
other; 
as 
though 
it 
were 
necessary 
to 
decide 
this 
question. 
It 
is 
enough 
to 
know 
that 
the 
properties 
which 
are 
attributed 
to 
each 
nature 
separately 
may 
rightly 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
concrete; 
for 
it 
is 
correct 
to 
say, 
that, 
in 
Christ, 
God 
suffered, 
man 
is 
omniscient 
and 
omnipotent; 
but 
to 
attribute 
to 
the 
humanity, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
union, 
omnipotence, 
ubiquity, 
and 
(what 
especially 
follows) 
eternity, 
is 
as 
incongruous, 
as 
to 
ascribe 
to 
the 
Divinity 
the 
having 
been 
born 
and 
suffered;aformofspeechwhichiseither 
animproprietyoracontradiction. 


We 
must 
hold, 
however, 
that, 
by 
the 
union 
with 
the 
Word, 
all 
the 
perfection, 
knowledge, 
and 
power, 
which 
man, 
as 
man, 
is 
capable 
of 
receiving, 
have 
been 
imparted 
to 
the 
humanity 
in 
itself; 
and 
it 
is 
safer 
to 
affirm 
this 
regarding 
Christ, 
even 
in 
the 
state 
of 
exinanition; 
although 
in 
that 



state, 
as 
the 
body 
remained 
passible, 
the 
hidden 
glory 
only 
appeared, 
as 
it 
were,by 
afewrays,shining 
out 
through 
the 
night. 


Christ, 
then, 
the 
Son 
of 
God 
and 
of 
man, 
born, 
without 
man’s 
agency, 
of 
a 
Virgin 
Mother, 
and 
exempt 
from 
all 
sin, 
offered 
Himself 
to 
God 
the 
Father, 
a 
most 
worthyvictim,for 
theexpiation 
of 
the 
guilt 
of 
the 
human 
race;satisfied, 
by 
his 
perfect 
humility 
and 
his 
passion, 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
men; 
and 
therefore, 
as 
faraswasinHim,diedforall. 


Nevertheless,ithas 
pleasedGod 
to 
ordain 
as 
the 
law 
ofman’s 
redemption, 
that 
its 
benefit 
should 
extend 
to 
all 
who, 
having 
been 
born 
again 
in 
Christ 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
should 
elicit 
a 
filial 
act 
of 
faith 
and 
love: 
for 
although 
a 
perpetual 
purity 
of 
mind 
and 
fervour 
of 
disposition 
towards 
God 
are, 
in 
the 
rigour 
of 
justice, 
always 
necessary, 
yet, 
through 
the 
equity 
of 
Divine 
grace, 
it 
has 
been 
effected 
by 
Christ, 
that, 
even 
in 
a 
person 
who 
falls 
after 
regeneration, 
every 
past 
sin 
shall 
be 
effaced 
by 
the 
sincere 
love 
of 
God, 
and 
(what 
is 
included 
therein) 
repentance 
for 
the 
past 
and 
a 
resolution 
of 
amendment. 


In 
the 
course 
of 
the 
last 
century, 
certain 
angry 
controversies 
arose 
on 
the 
questions 
of 
the 
conversion 
of 
man, 
of 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
sinner, 
and 
of 
the 
merit 
of 
good 
works, 
occasioned 
by 
the 
inconvenient 
expressions 
of 
some 
of 
the 
disputants, 
and 
the 
excesses 
of 
others 
on 
the 
opposite 
side. 
In 
my 
opinion, 
however, 
they 
may 
easily 
be 
adjusted, 
if 
one 
will 
but 
discard 
the 
sophistry 
in 
which 
they 
have 
been 
involved, 
and 
consider 
the 
subject 
on 
its 
ownmerits. 


In 
the 
first 
place, 
therefore, 
we 
must 
hold 
that, 
by 
the 
fall, 
human 
nature 
has 
been 
so 
thoroughly 
corrupted, 
that, 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
Divine 
grace, 
it 
is 
unable 
not 
alone 
to 
perform, 
but 
even 
to 
originate, 
any 
good 
work 
or 
any 
act 
agreeable 
to 
God. 
Without 
the 
aid, 
therefore, 
of 
preventing 
and 
exciting 
grace, 
we 
are 
not 
capable 
either 
of 
prayer, 
or 
of 
the 
wish 
or 
desire 
of 



amending 
our 
life 
or 
seeking 
the 
true 
faith, 
or, 
in 
general, 
of 
any 
good 
motion. 


But, 
upon 
the 
other 
hand, 
we 
must 
also 
hold 
that 
man’s 
free 
will 
is 
not 
destroyed 
by 
the 
fall, 
even 
in 
things 
divine 
and 
necessary 
for 
salvation; 
but 
that 
all 
voluntaryacts(althoughtheyare 
excited 
bygrace 
iftheybe 
good,and 
proceed 
from 
our 
corrupt 
nature 
if 
they 
be 
bad,) 
are, 
nevertheless, 
“spontaneous 
with 
election,” 
and 
therefore 
free: 
— 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
it 
does 
not 
interfere 
with 
the 
liberty 
of 
our 
actions 
in 
common 
life, 
that 
we 
are 
excited 
to 
these 
actions 
by 
rays 
of 
light 
which 
are 
transmitted 
through 
the 
agency 
of 
the 
eyes, 
and 
though 
the 
excitement 
is 
sometimes 
so 
powerful 
that, 
notwithstanding 
our 
deliberation, 
and 
the 
power 
which 
we 
still 
retain 
of 
resisting 
the 
impressions, 
it 
may 
yet 
be 
foreseen 
that 
the 
act 
will 
certainly 
follow; 
— 
for 
the 
certainty 
of 
an 
act 
is 
one 
thing, 
and 
its 
necessity 
another. 
And 
hence 
a 
sinful 
action 
is 
contingent, 
and 
the 
act 
of 
eliciting 
good 
motions 
is 
free. 
And 
although 
the 
impulse 
under 
which 
we 
act, 
and 
the 
aid 
which 
we 
receive, 
are 
from 
God, 
yet 
there 
is 
always 
some 
co-operation 
on 
man’s 
part, 
elsehe 
could 
not 
besaidto 
haveacted. 


The 
ulterior 
questions 
— 
as, 
whether, 
in 
the 
unregenerate, 
these 
powers 
of 
producinggoodmotionsaremutilatedoronly 
impeded,andwhatillustrations 
may 
best 
be 
employed 
to 
explain 
the 
aid 
afforded 
by 
grace 
— 
are 
very 
idle 
and 
profitless 
discussions, 
raised 
by 
those 
who 
exert 
all 
their 
ingenuity 
to 
discover, 
in 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
Church, 
matter 
at 
which 
to 
cavil, 
with 
any 
shewofreason,however 
trivial. 


To 
all 
men 
God 
gives 
sufficient 
grace? 
in 
so 
far 
that, 
supposing 
only 
a 
serious 
will 
on 
their 
part, 
there 
is 
no 
further 
requisite 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
salvation 
which 
it 
is 
not 
in 
their 
own 
power 
to 
secure. 
And 
hence 
many 
pious 
menhave 
heldit 
ascertain,that 
“every 
man 
who 
cometh 
into 
this 
world” 
is 
so 
“enlightened” 
by 
the 
Light 
of 
Souls, 
the 
eternal 
Son 
of 
God, 
and 
by 
his 
Holy 



Spirit, 
that, 
at 
least 
before 
his 
death, 
provided 
he 
himself 
wills 
it, 
he 
may 
attain, 
either 
by 
external 
preaching 
or 
by 
internal 
enlightenment 
of 
the 
mind, 
to 
such 
knowledge 
as 
is 
sufficient 
and 
necessary 
for 
salvation; 
so 
that 
if, 
after 
this 
enlightenment, 
he 
obstinately 
resist 
the 
call 
of 
God, 
he 
may 
at 
least 
be 
rendered 
inexcusable; 
for 
this 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
vindication 
of 
the 
Divine 
justice. 
But 
as 
to 
the 
means 
by 
which 
God 
effects 
this, 
even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
no 
suspicion 
of 
the 
Gospel 
of 
Christ 
has 
ever 
been 
conveyed 
by 
the 
external 
preaching 
of 
the 
word 
this 
is 
a 
question 
which 
we 
may 
not 
venturehastilyto 
decide,butmustleaveto 
his 
wisdomandmercy. 


God, 
however, 
does 
not 
grant 
always, 
and 
to 
all 
men, 
that 
efficacious 
or 
victorious 
grace 
which 
actually 
produces 
the 
good-will, 
overcomes 
the 
inclinations 
of 
man, 
and 
outweighs 
the 
opposing 
solicitations 
of 
imperfect 
or 
corrupt 
nature; 
otherwise 
all 
men, 
without 
exception, 
would 
be 
saved. 
But 
the 
reason 
why 
this 
is 
not 
done, 
— 
that 
is, 
why, 
in 
preference 
to 
many 
others 
equally 
possible, 
certain 
persons 
are 
admitted 
into 
existence 
by 
God, 
although 
the 
notion 
or 
foreknowledge 
of 
them 
involves 
the 
idea 
of 
impenitence, 
and 
of 
other 
free 
actions 
incompatible 
with 
salvation, 
and 
of 
certain 
degrees 
of 
divine 
grace 
inferior 
to 
the 
crowning 
and 
victorious 
grace, 


— 
belongs 
to 
the 
mysteries 
of 
God’s 
government, 
inaccessible 
to 
mortals; 
and 
on 
such 
questions 
we 
must 
rest 
satisfied 
with 
this 
one 
principle, 
that 
whatever 
has 
pleased 
God 
is 
best; 
that 
in 
no 
other 
order 
could 
the 
perfection 
of 
things 
be 
better 
attained; 
and 
that, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
observed, 
the 
evils 
which 
Godpermitsarealwaysconvertedinto 
amuchgreatergood. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
are 
not 
to 
imagine 
that 
the 
Divine 
will 
for 
men’s 
salvation, 
or 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ, 
or, 
at 
least, 
efficacious 
grace, 
are 
confined 
solely 
to 
theelect 
—thatis,to 
those 
towhomthe 
crowningandfinal 
grace 
of 
blessed 
perseverance 
is 
vouchsafed. 
For 
Christ 
died 
for 
all; 
and 
efficacious 
grace, 
and 
that 
true 
conversion 
and 
regeneration 
through 
the 
Spirit 
of 
God, 



whereby 
we 
are 
received 
into 
the 
number 
of 
his 
children, 
may 
be 
granted 
to 
many 
who 
will 
not 
persevere. 
Nor 
do 
I 
see 
how 
certain 
learned 
men 
can 
have 
been 
betrayed 
into 
such 
monstrous 
paradoxes, 
revolting 
both 
in 
their 
intrinsic 
meaning 
and 
in 
their 
consequences, 
as, 
(fixing 
a 
law, 
as 
it 
were, 
for 
God, 
and 
circumscribing 
according 
to 
their 
caprice 
the 
economy 
of 
Divine 
grace,) 
to 
imagine 
that 
a 
person 
who 
is 
not 
to 
persevere 
does 
not 
really 
receive 
grace, 
and 
is 
not 
really 
regenerated 
by 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
no 
matter 
what 
works 
he 
may 
perform, 
no 
matter 
how 
pious 
and 
well-disposed 
he 
may 
appear 
to 
himself 
and 
to 
others; 
and 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
a 
person 
who 
is 
truly 
elect, 
and 
destined 
to 
final 
penitence, 
never 
forfeits 
the 
grace 
once 
received 
from 
God, 
and 
the 
indwelling 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
even 
though 
he 
should 
spend 
his 
whole 
life 
in 
a 
series 
of 
adulteries 
and 
murders. 
Indeed, 
even 
though 
it 
were 
possible 
to 
excuse 
these 
novel 
and 
offensive 
dogmas, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
on 
what 
foundation 
they 
rest, 
or 
what 
purpose 
of 
edification 
they 
can 
serve. 
For, 
if 
expressions 
occasionally 
occur 
which 
would 
appear 
to 
favour 
this 
revolting 
opinion, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
soften 
them 
down 
by 
comparison 
with 
others 
far 
more 
numerous, 
than 
to 
add 
to 
their 
harshness 
by 
a 
rigorous 
interpretation. 
And 
it 
seems 
more 
consonant 
with 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
to 
grant 
a 
temporary 
and 
revocable, 
but 
visible, 
grace, 
than 
a 
grace 
perpetual 
and 
inadmissible, 
but 
utterly 
hidden, 
and 
compatible 
with 
the 
most 
depraved 
habit 
of 
soul 
and 
the 
mostheinouscrimes. 


When 
man, 
therefore, 
by 
God’s 
preventing 
grace, 
is 
aroused 
from 
the 
deadly 
sleep 
of 
sin 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
his 
misery, 
a 
spirit 
of 
self-examination, 
and 
a 
firm 
resolve 
of 
seeking 
and 
following 
the 
saving 
truth; 
and 
when, 
rejecting 
or 
disregarding 
all 
other 
thoughts 
and 
affections, 
and 
all 
worldly 
or 
carnal 
maxims, 
he 
devotes 
his 
whole 
energies 
to 
the 
care 
of 
salvation; 
he 
perceives, 
even 
from 
the 
light 
of 
nature, 
what 
is 
the 
law 
and 
the 
will 
of 
God; 
and, 
admonished 
by 
memory, 
he 
acknowledges 
with 
groans 
and 
trembling 



how 
far 
he 
has 
strayed 
therefrom, 
what 
grievous 
punishment 
he 
has 
merited, 
and 
how 
heinously 
he 
has 
offended 
his 
Creator, 
to 
whom 
he 
owed 
supreme 
honour 
and 
love. 
Pursuing 
this 
consideration, 
he 
elicits 
from 
amid 
the 
terrors 
of 
conscience 
the 
light 
of 
returning 
hope; 
for 
he 
discovers 
that 
the 
same 
most 
just 
Judge, 
in 
his 
infinite 
mercy, 
still 
takes 
pity 
upon 
human 
weakness, 
and 
that 
Hehas 
notlaidaside 
hisgood-will 
towards 
sinners,provided, 
while 
there 
is 
yet 
time, 
they 
seek 
a 
refuge 
in 
his 
mercy. 
And 
thus 
as, 
to 
all 
who 
seriously 
turn 
to 
God, 
the 
Gospel 
holds 
forth 
Christ 
as 
the 
haven 
of 
salvation, 
which 
all 
may 
reach 
by 
true 
penitence 
— 
(and 
penitence, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
sufficient, 
must 
proceed, 
not 
from 
fear 
of 
punishment 
or 
hope 
of 
reward 
alone, 
but 
from 
sincere 
love 
of 
God) 
— 
whether 
it 
be 
the 
penitence 
of 
those 
who 
are 
received 
for 
the 
first 
time 
into 
the 
Church 
of 
God, 
as 
in 
the 
baptism 
of 
adults, 
or 
of 
those 
who, 
having 
been 
again 
imperilled 
in 
the 
gulf 
of 
sin, 
betake 
themselves 
anew 
to 
penance, 
as 
to 
a 
second 
plank 
after 
shipwreck; 
— 
and 
as 
God 
promises 
to 
those 
who 
turn 
to 
Him 
and 
do 
penance, 
not 
only 
pardon 
of 
past 
sins, 
but 
also 
new 
strength 
for 
a 
better 
life, 
and 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
and 
regeneration; 
— 
hence 
follows 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
sinner; 
whereby 
he 
is 
not 
only 
absolved 
from 
guilt, 
through 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
Christ 
laid 
hold 
on 
by 
faith, 
but 
also, 
by 
the 
infusion 
of 
the 
charity 
of 
Divine 
love, 
is 
invested 
withthehabitof 
justiceand 
the 
newman. 


Now, 
as 
these 
principles 
are 
certain 
and 
almost 
universally 
admitted, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
very 
idle 
to 
enter 
into 
the 
controversies 
which 
have 
been 
raised 
by 
certainwriters 
concerning 
the 
formof 
justification, 
viz. 
whether 
it 
consists 
in 
the 
imputation 
of 
the 
merit 
and 
satisfaction 
of 
Christ, 
or 
in 
habitual 
infused 
justice. 
For 
as 
all 
are 
compelled 
to 
admit 
that 
both 
are 
necessary, 
where 
is 
the 
need 
for 
further 
discussion? 
and 
where 
shall 
we 
find 
a 
dispute 
about 
words, 
if 
this 
be 
not 
such? 
If 
justification 
be 
taken, 
as 
it 
is 
usually 
taken 
by 
jurists, 
to 
mean 
freedom 
from 
imputability, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
our 



justification, 
that 
is, 
of 
our 
innocence, 
consists 
in 
the 
imputation 
of 
Christ’s 
satisfaction 
to 
us, 
in 
virtue 
whereof 
pardon 
is 
granted 
to 
those 
who 
believe, 
and 
do 
penance. 
But 
if 
justification 
be 
understood, 
as 
in 
ethics, 
to 
mean, 
the 
being 
invested 
with 
the 
habit 
of 
justice 
— 
as 
it 
is 
said 
in 
the 
Apocalypse: 
“He 
that 
is 
just, 
let 
him 
he 
justified 
still 
— 
that 
is, 
“let 
his 
habit 
of 
justice 
increase;” 
— 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
this 
habit 
of 
justice 
is 
infused 
into 
us 
by 
God 
in 
the 
act 
of 
regeneration, 
when 
we 
put 
on 
the 
new 
man. 
Whence 
it 
may 
not 
inaptly 
be 
said 
that 
the 
gift 
of 
penance 
and 
of 
pardon 
(not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
other 
favours, 
by 
which 
God 
assists 
and 
prevents 
us, 
even 
before 
the 
work 
of 
regeneration 
is 
complete,) 
is 
a 
“grace 
given 
gratuitously 
whereas 
the 
infusion 
of 
the 
new 
habit 
is 
a 
grace 
given 
to 
penitents 
in 
virtue 
of 
an 
institution 
congruous 
to 
the 
Divine 
wisdom— 
“a 
grace 
which 
renders 
us 
grateful 
and 
pleasing” 
to 
God, 
which 
really 
operates 
a 
conversion 
of 
our 
mind, 
and 
crowns 
the 
whole 
work 
of 
our 
regeneration. 
But, 
however 
this 
may 
be, 
we 
must 
hold, 
that 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
justification, 
even 
considered 
as 
consisting 
in 
the 
remission 
of 
imputability, 
not 
faith 
only, 
but 
also 
penance, 
and 
therefore 
charity,isnecessary. 


Equally 
profitless 
is 
it 
to 
contrast 
the 
two 
divine 
virtues, 
faith 
and 
charity, 
with 
one 
another, 
to 
raise, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
question 
of 
precedence 
between 
them, 
and 
to 
discuss 
anxiously 
which 
of 
them 
has 
the 
principal 
share 
in 
justification. 
For 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
faith 
without 
charity 
is 
dead, 
so 
also 
is 
it 
certain 
that 
charity 
without 
faith 
(love 
without 
knowledge) 
is 
of 
no 
effect. 
And 
hence 
faith 
is 
an 
essential 
of 
charity, 
charity 
a 
complementoffaith. 


And 
indeed 
some 
of 
those 
who 
attribute 
justification 
entirely 
and 
exclusively 
to 
faith, 
and 
maintain 
that 
the 
other 
virtues 
will 
indubitably 
follow 
as 
fruits 
of 
justification 
by 
faith, 
seem 
to 
adopt 
a 
notion 
of 
faith 
differentfromthatwhich 
hasheretoforebeenreceived 
intheschools;forthey 



refer 
faith 
not 
only 
to 
the 
intellect, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
will; 
nay, 
they 
extend 
their 
notion 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
faith 
so 
far 
as 
to 
make 
it 
comprise 
filial 
confidence 
in 
God, 
which 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
involve 
charity 
or 
the 
love 
of 
God. 
It 
is 
not 
wonderful, 
therefore, 
that 
they 
hold 
men 
to 
be 
justified 
by 
faith 
alone, 
whereas 
under 
faith 
they 
comprise 
hope 
and 
charity; 
and 
therefore, 
if 
they 
thinkso, 
the 
questionbecomes 
ameredispute 
ofwords. 


It 
must 
be 
admitted, 
indeed, 
that, 
even 
according 
to 
the 
received 
notions, 
faith, 
or 
assent, 
partakes, 
in 
a 
certain 
sense, 
of 
the 
will; 
for, 
were 
it 
otherwise, 
the 
act 
could 
not 
be 
commanded 
by 
God, 
nor 
elicited 
by 
men 
in 
obedience 
to 
the 
command, 
though 
they 
desired 
to 
do 
so. 
And, 
in 
truth, 
we 
often 
see 
men 
hold 
a 
thing 
as 
true, 
although 
they 
are 
not 
able 
to 
assign, 
nay 
perhaps 
never 
have 
been 
conscious 
of, 
any 
reason 
for 
their 
opinion; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
faith 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
said 
above, 
is 
excited 
by 
God 
in 
the 
minds 
even 
of 
simplepeoplewho 
do 
notinquire 
into 
the 
reasonsoftheir 
belief; 
sothat, 
in 
truth, 
this 
unreasoning 
assent 
consists 
in 
that 
state 
of 
mind 
which 
produces 
in 
those 
who 
are 
under 
its 
influence 
the 
same 
dispositions, 
and 
prepares 
them 
to 
act 
and 
to 
suffer 
as 
efficaciously 
as 
the 
persons 
who 
are 
conscious 
of 
motives 
for 
their 
belief, 
and 
sometimes 
more 
efficaciously. 
The 
matter 
may 
be 
understood 
from 
an 
illustration: 
We 
know 
that 
there 
are 
persons 
who, 
as 
far 
as 
arguments 
go, 
are 
satisfied 
that 
they 
will 
never 
meet 
ghosts 
in 
the 
dark, 
and 
who, 
nevertheless, 
will 
not 
venture 
to 
walk 
alone 
at 
night, 
or, 
if 
they 
do, 
are 
seized 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
panic 
fear. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
there 
are 
others 
who 
never 
even 
think 
of 
arguments 
against 
the 
fear 
of 
ghosts, 
and 
who, 
notwithstanding, 
secured 
by 
the 
firm 
faith 
and 
conviction 
which 
they 
possess, 
fearlessly 
spend 
whole 
nights 
alone 
in 
the 
woods 
and 
in 
the 
dens 
of 
wild 
beasts. 
Thus, 
in 
thecase 
of 
the 
former, 
thereseemsto 
be 
a 
kind 
ofspeculative 
opinion, 
in 
that 
of 
the 
latter, 
rather 
a 
practical 
assent 
— 
a 
quality 
which 
undoubtedly 
is 
especially 
required 
in 
faith. 
And 
Christ 
himself 
has 
said 
that 



there 
are 
many 
degrees 
of 
faith; 
and 
the 
highest 
of 
these 
are 
to 
be 
derived, 
not 
so 
much 
from 
the 
mere 
intellect 
(otherwise 
those 
whose 
learning 
was 
greater 
would 
have 
the 
greater 
faith, 
which 
certainly 
was 
not 
true 
of 
the 
Canaanite 
woman, 
or 
of 
the 
centurion 
of 
Capharnaum, 
though 
Christ 
himself 
attributed 
great 
faith 
to 
them), 
as 
from 
the 
affection 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
its 
readiness 
to 
embrace 
the 
doctrine 
when 
imparted, 
although 
reason 
should 
appear 
not 
only 
not 
to 
favour 
it, 
but 
even 
to 
be 
at 
variance 
with 
it. 
However, 
faith, 
or 
practical 
assent 
to 
the 
articles 
of 
the 
Christian 
religion 
as 
a 
whole, 
may 
be 
altogether 
distinguished 
from 
hope 
and 
charity, 
and 
from 
the 
filial 
confidence 
by 
which 
weapplygeneraldoctrinesspeciallyto 
ourselves. 


Nor 
are 
we 
to 
imagine, 
as 
some 
have 
done, 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
justification, 
it 
is 
required 
that 
a 
man 
should 
believe 
with 
divine 
faith 
that 
he 
is 
justified, 
much 
less 
that 
he 
is 
elect 
and 
secure 
of 
persevering; 
for, 
as 
there 
are 
many 
who 
have 
true 
faith, 
and 
yet 
will 
not 
persevere, 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
these 
persons 
were 
bound, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
faith 
which 
is 
necessary 
to 
justification, 
to 
believe 
what 
is 
false. 
But, 
besides, 
those 
who 
require 
in 
the 
person 
who 
is 
justified 
a 
previous 
belief 
of 
his 
own 
justification, 
involve 
themselves 
in 
contradictions. 
For, 
if 
the 
belief 
of 
one’s 
justification 
is 
required 
for 
justification, 
and 
therefore 
precedes 
it, 
it 
follows 
that 
a 
man 
who 
is 
not 
yet 
justified 
must 
believe 
that 
he 
is 
justified, 
and, 
therefore, 
that 
he 
must 
believe 
what 
is 
false. 
And 
if 
they 
content 
themselves 
with 
requiring 
from 
him 
a 
belief 
that 
he 
certainly 
will 
be 
justified, 
they 
escape 
these 
contradictions, 
it 
is 
true, 
but,ontheotherhand,theyarbitrarilyinventconditionsof 
justification 
which 
are 
entirely 
without 
any 
warrant 
either 
of 
reason 
or 
of 
Scripture. 
For 
if 
a 
man 
possess 
faith 
and 
charity, 
he 
will 
also 
have 
the 
grace 
of 
justification, 
though 
he 
should 
not 
even 
advert 
to 
the 
reflex 
act, 
whether 
he 
receives 
it 
or 
not. 
Nor 
does 
this 
filial 
confidence, 
or 
the 
hope 
by 
which 
we 
believe 
and 
trust 
that 
our 
sins 
are 
remitted, 
and 
that 
we 
are 
received 
into 
favour 
and 
made 
children 
of 



God, 
belong 
to 
that 
divine 
faith 
in 
the 
general 
promises 
and 
infallible 
revelations 
of 
God; 
because 
this 
confidence 
has 
for 
its 
object 
not 
alone 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
Divine 
goodness, 
but 
also 
individual 
human 
things 
regarding 
matters 
of 
fact; 
and 
it 
springs 
from 
the 
consideration 
and 
memory 
of 
things 
which 
pass 
in 
our 
mind; 
and 
consequently 
does 
not 
rise 
beyond 
moral 
certainty. 
Should 
anydoubts,therefore,arise 
from 
the 
consciousnessof 
our 
own 
infirmity, 
they 
do 
not 
destroy 
this 
filial 
confidence; 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
temptations 
of 
doubt 
regarding 
the 
articles 
of 
religion 
do 
not 
destroy 
the 
substance 
of 
faith, 
even 
though 
it 
be 
languid. 
It 
is 
our 
duty, 
however, 
to 
struggle 
against 
these 
doubts; 
for, 
if 
we 
but 
fix 
our 
thoughts 
firmly 
upon 
God’s 
goodness, 
we 
must 
conclude 
that 
He 
will 
never 
suffer 
those 
who 
“thirst 
after 
truth,” 
and 
seek 
grace, 
to 
be 
deceived 
by 
falsehood 
to 
their 
own 
destruction, 
ortofailofobtaining 
mercy. 


That 
charity, 
or 
love, 
which 
is 
a 
divine 
virtue, 
consists 
in 
our 
loving 
God 
above 
all 
things, 
and 
seeking 
in 
Him 
our 
sovereign 
good; 
and, 
therefore, 
we 
are 
to 
love 
Him, 
not 
only 
for 
the 
benefits 
which 
He 
bestows 
on 
us, 
but 
also 
for 
Himself, 
and 
as 
our 
last 
end. 
For, 
in 
general, 
it 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
that 
true 
love 
which 
is 
called 
“the 
love 
of 
friendship,” 
to 
place 
our 
happiness 
and 
perfection 
in 
the 
perfection 
or 
happiness 
of 
the 
beloved 
object; 
in 
part, 
if 
the 
object 
be 
of 
finite 
perfection 
(as 
when 
we 
love 
children 
or 
friends), 
but 
entirely,if 
itbeof 
supremeexcellence 
andgoodness. 


Hope, 
as 
used 
by 
theologians, 
is 
that 
love 
which 
is 
called 
“a 
love 
of 
concupiscence,” 
or 
an 
affection 
towards 
God, 
springing 
from 
the 
consideration, 
not 
of 
God’s 
excellence 
and 
perfection, 
but 
of 
his 
beneficence 
towards 
ourselves, 
and 
of 
the 
great 
benefits 
which 
He 
promises 
to 
his 
servants, 
and 
especially 
that 
of 
eternal 
life; 
— 
although 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
consideration 
of 
God’s 
benefits 
may 
also 
manifest 
his 
perfection 
to 
us; 
in 
which 
casehopeis 
elevatedinto 
charity. 



And 
as 
the 
evidence 
of 
reason 
and 
of 
Scripture 
assures 
us 
that 
true 
and 
perfect 
charity 
is 
not 
only 
prescribed 
by 
God, 
but 
is 
moreover 
the 
highest 
service 
which 
man 
can 
render 
to 
his 
God, 
and 
that 
without 
it 
faith 
is 
dead, 
therefore 
has 
it 
been 
justly 
and 
congruously 
ordained 
that 
through 
it 
our 
justification, 
reconciliation, 
and 
renovation 
are 
completed; 
although 
the 
actual 
grace 
of 
charity 
is 
obtained 
for 
us, 
and 
granted 
to 
us, 
solely 
through 
Christ, 
while 
we 
are 
still 
separated 
from 
God; 
and 
although 
its 
power 
of 
effacing 
sin 
springs 
solely 
from 
Christ’s 
merit, 
imputed 
to 
us 
through 
a 
lively 
faith. 
For, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
said, 
in 
the 
rigour 
of 
Divine 
justice 
it 
would 
not 
suffice 
for 
the 
pardon 
of 
past 
sin 
to 
love 
once, 
but 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
have 
always 
maintained 
these 
good 
dispositions. 
But, 
seeing 
that 
Christ 
has 
satisfied 
for 
us, 
the 
conditions 
which 
God 
requires 
in 
order 
that 
we 
be 
made 
sharers 
of 
Christ’s 
merit 
are 
easy 
of 
fulfilment; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
possible, 
consistently 
withthe 
orderof 
the 
Divinejustice 
and 
wisdom, 
to 
understand 
or 
imagine 
any 
condition 
more 
easy 
of 
fulfilment, 
than 
that 
of 
the 
love 
of 
God 
himself, 
the 
most 
amiable 
and 
fairest 
of 
all 
conceivable 
objects, 
which 
is 
the 
sole 
condition 
required 
of 
us 
by 
Him, 
after 
Christ’s 
satisfaction, 
as 
the 
price 
oftherestorationofhisfriendship, 
— 
apricein 
itself 
utterlyinadequate. 


And 
whereas 
in 
those 
to 
whom 
God’s 
abiding 
grace 
has 
been 
vouchsafed 
through 
Christ, 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
sin, 
any 
thing 
hateful 
to 
God, 
“any 
condemnation” 
it 
appears 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
form 
of 
sound 
words 
to 
say 
that 
original 
sin 
remains 
after 
regeneration, 
though 
it 
is 
weakened 
or 
is 
not 
imputed; 
and 
we 
shall 
consult 
more 
for 
the 
propriety 
of 
language 
if 
we 
say, 
that 
what 
constitutes 
in 
the 
original 
evil 
the 
distinctive 
character 
of 
sin, 
is 
effaced 
in 
regeneration 
through 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ 
and 
the 
efficacy 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit; 
although 
the 
flame 
of 
corrupt 
nature 
is 
not 
entirely 
extinguished; 
and 
although, 
from 
the 
infirmity 
of 
human 
nature, 
even 
the 
just 
are 
occasionallybetrayedintovenialerrors. 



The 
question 
then 
arises, 
what 
it 
is 
in 
original 
sin 
that 
possesses 
the 
distinctive 
character 
of 
sin? 
for 
neither 
the 
sole 
privation 
of 
original 
justice, 
nor 
the 
positive 
stain 
of 
our 
nature 
which 
always 
clings 
to 
us, 
constitutes 
the 
distinctive 
character 
of 
sin. 
There 
are 
some 
Catholic 
divines, 
therefore, 
who 
hold 
that, 
in 
original 
sin, 
what 
constitutes 
the 
form 
of 
sin, 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
imputation 
of 
the 
crime 
committed 
by 
Adam, 
or 
simply 
the 
imputability 
itself; 
others 
acknowledge 
in 
it 
nothing, 
at 
least 
nothing 
positive, 
in 
which 
the 
nature 
of 
sin 
can 
be 
placed, 
and 
seek 
it 
altogether 
in 
the 
defect 
of 
original 
justice; 
they 
conceive, 
however, 
that 
there 
is 
something 
more 
than 
this, 
which 
they 
explain 
by 
an 
illustration. 
It 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
intention, 
like 
every 
other 
act 
of 
the 
mind, 
is 
of 
two 
kinds 
— 
virtual 
and 
actual; 
a 
virtual 
intention, 
such 
as 
they 
contemplate, 
is 
sometimes 
found 
in 
a 
person 
baptising, 
or 
administering 
any 
other 
sacrament; 
for 
the 
intention, 
provided 
it 
existed 
in 
the 
beginning, 
is 
supposed 
to 
endure 
throughout 
the 
entire 
time 
of 
the, 
act, 
although 
themind 
maynotalwaysadvert 
towhatit 
isdoing,or,perhaps,may 
even 
be 
carried 
away 
by 
other 
thoughts, 
during 
the 
entire 
action, 
without 
ever 
reverting 
to 
the 
act 
in 
which 
it 
is 
engaged. 
Hence 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
condition 
of 
those 
who 
are 
affected 
by 
original 
sin 
is 
somewhat 
similar; 
and 
we 
may 
conceive 
that 
all 
men 
have, 
in 
some 
hidden 
way, 
sinned 
in 
Adam, 
and 
that, 
as 
their 
will 
has 
been 
depraved 
by 
Adam’s 
sin, 
they 
have 
always 
retained, 
until 
the 
restoration 
of 
grace, 
something 
analogous 
to 
a 
virtual 
intention 
of 
sinning, 
which, 
before 
regeneration, 
prevails 
over 
even 
their 
good 
motions, 
or, 
at 
least, 
mingles 
itself 
with 
them. 
It 
must 
be 
understood, 
however, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
that 
this 
virtual 
evil 
intention 
is 
removed 
by 
true 
penance 
along 
with 
the 
guilt; 
and 
that 
the 
only 
effect 
which 
remains 
is 
the 
concupiscenceofthefleshrebelling 
againstthe 
spirit. 


We 
must 
be 
carefulhowever,not 
to 
underratethe 
evil 
influenceoforiginal 
sin, 
as 
though 
the 
natural 
powers 
which 
existed 
before 
the 
fall 
are 
not 
much 



lessened 
and 
depraved 
thereby; 
lest, 
having 
been 
delivered 
from 
it, 
we 
should 
detract 
from 
the 
favour 
which 
God 
has 
thus 
bestowed 
on 
us; 
nor 
should 
we 
think 
lightly 
of 
the 
relics 
of 
it 
which 
still 
cling 
to 
us, 
as 
though 
they 
were 
trifling 
and 
easily 
overcome, 
lest 
perchance 
we 
be 
betrayed 
into 
undue 
arrogance. 


But 
neither 
should 
we, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
so 
far 
exaggerate 
its 
evil 
effects, 
as 
to 
say 
that 
no 
good 
whatever 
is 
left, 
and 
that 
every 
act 
of 
the 
unregenerate 
is 
of 
itself 
a 
sin; 
for 
St. 
Augustine 
(Ep. 
130) 
admits 
that 
the 
continence 
of 
Polemon 
was 
a 
gift 
of 
God; 
now, 
who 
would 
assert 
that 
to 
be 
a 
sin, 
which 
is 
given 
by 
God? 
Nor, 
again, 
are 
to 
imagine 
that 
original 
sin 
has 
struck 
its 
roots 
so 
deeply, 
as 
not 
to 
give 
way 
even 
to 
Divine 
grace 
and 
to 
the 
cleansing 
and 
sanctifying 
blood 
of 
the 
Saviour; 
as 
though 
even 
that 
involuntary 
concupiscence 
which, 
from 
the 
very 
composition 
of 
the 
human 
machine 
as 
at 
present 
constituted, 
remains 
even 
in 
the 
pious, 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
sin; 
whereas 
no 
involuntary 
act 
can 
ever 
be 
a 
sin; 
and 
it 
is 
wrong 
to 
pervert 
the 
true 
notions 
of 
things, 
under 
pretence 
of 
a 
mistaken 
interpretation 
of 
Scripture. 


Let 
us 
now 
examine 
what 
are 
the 
fruits 
of 
regeneration, 
in 
what 
manner 
good 
works 
arise 
therefrom, 
and 
what 
is 
the 
efficacy 
of 
such 
works. 
We 
have 
already 
said 
that, 
before 
regeneration, 
the 
love 
of 
God 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
performance 
of 
that 
penance 
which 
is 
available 
for 
salvation; 
that 
from 
this 
penance, 
through 
the 
merit 
of 
Christ 
apprehended 
by 
faith, 
follows 
pardon 
of 
sin 
and 
renovation 
of 
the 
entire 
man, 
or 
the 
virtue 
of 
Divine 
charity; 
and 
that 
(although 
the 
habits 
of 
the 
other 
virtues 
are 
acquired 
only 
by 
repeated 
acts) 
this 
virtue, 
through 
the 
mercy 
of 
God, 
is 
infused 
on 
account 
of 
a 
single 
act 
of 
love. 
Now 
this 
habitisessentiallyactive; 
forby 
its 
very 
natureitis 
constantly 
endeavouring 
to 
burst 
forth 
into 
action, 
seeking 
opportunities 
of 
acting, 
and 
turning 
them 
to 
a 
profitable 
account. 
It 
may 
be 
safely 
asserted, 
therefore, 
that 



good 
works, 
as 
far 
as 
they 
consist 
in 
a 
serious 
will, 
are 
necessary 
to 
salvation; 
for 
a 
man 
who 
does 
not 
love 
God 
is 
neither 
a 
friend 
of 
God 
nor 
in 
the 
state 
of 
grace, 
because 
both 
penance 
and 
the 
renovation 
of 
man 
involve 
a 
contradiction, 
unless 
they 
are 
accompanied 
by 
love. 
Now 
all 
good 
works 
are, 
according 
to 
the 
received 
phrase, 
virtually 
contained 
in 
this 
right 
intention 
and 
sincere 
affection 
towards 
God; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
“one 
thing 
necessary,” 
which 
Christadmonishedusshouldbe 
preferred 
toallelse 
beside. 


Whosoever, 
therefore, 
loves 
God 
above 
all 
things, 
acquiesces, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
observed, 
in 
his 
will 
as 
regards 
the 
past, 
even 
though 
he 
should 
seem 
to 
be 
deserted, 
and 
should 
find 
himself 
condemned 
to 
struggle 
with 
many 
adversities; 
being 
firmly 
persuaded 
that 
God 
is 
good 
and 
faithful, 
that 
He 
tenderly 
loves 
“men 
of 
good 
will,” 
and 
that 
He 
disposes 
all 
things 
so 
as 
to 
turn, 
in 
the 
end, 
to 
the 
good 
of 
those 
who 
love 
Him. 
And, 
as 
regards 
the 
future, 
he 
endeavours 
with 
all 
possible 
fervour 
to 
obey 
the 
commands 
of 
God, 
not 
alone 
those 
which 
are 
expressly 
revealed, 
but 
also 
those 
which 
are 
presumed 
from 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
Divine 
glory 
or 
of 
the 
public 
good. 
And 
in 
cases 
of 
doubt 
he 
chooses 
the 
part 
which 
is 
safer, 
more 
probable, 
and 
more 
advantageous; 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
an 
active, 
industrious, 
and 
zealous 
minister 
would 
act, 
if 
entrusted 
by 
a 
great 
prince 
with 
the 
management 
of 
his 
affairs. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
greater 
or 
better 
master 
than 
God; 
none 
to 
whose 
exclusiveserviceallourpowersmay 
more 
rightfullybedevoted. 


From 
the 
love 
of 
God 
springs 
the 
love 
of 
our 
brother; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
every 
man 
with 
whom 
we 
may 
in 
any 
way 
be 
brought 
into 
connexion. 
And 
the 
idleness 
and 
insincerity 
of 
professions 
of 
the 
love 
of 
God 
in 
one 
who 
loves 
not 
his 
brother, 
are 
admirably 
inculcated 
by 
John, 
of 
whom 
it 
is 
related 
by 
Jerome, 
that 
in 
his 
extreme 
old 
age, 
when 
carried 
in 
the 
arms 
of 
his 
disciples 
to 
the 
church, 
he 
used 
to 
confine 
himself 
to 
one 
single 
exhortation, 
“My 
little 
children, 
love 
one 
another!” 
— 
and 
that 
when, 
at 
last, 
some 
one, 



wearied 
by 
the 
unvarying 
repetition, 
asked 
why 
he 
always 
inculcated 
this 
precept, 
and 
this 
alone, 
he 
replied 
by 
a 
sentiment 
truly 
worthy 
of 
John: 
“Because,” 
said 
he, 
“it 
is 
our 
Lord’s 
command, 
and 
its 
observance 
is 
alone 
sufficient.” 
Now 
Christ 
himself 
has 
prescribed 
an 
admirable 
rule 
of 
fraternal 
love, 
and 
one 
which 
even 
the 
Gentiles 
warmly 
applauded, 
viz. 
“that 
we 
love 
our 
neighbour 
as 
ourselves, 
and 
therefore 
that 
we 
do, 
or 
refrain 
from 
doing, 
to 
others, 
what 
we 
would, 
or 
would 
not, 
that 
others 
should 
do 
to 
us.” 
But, 
although 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
“charity 
begins 
at 
home,” 
and 
that, 
as 
regards 
others,this 
all-embracingand 
universal 
benevolence 
should 
make 
us 
select 
as 
its 
object 
that 
person 
on 
whom 
the 
conferring 
the 
benefit 
will 
be 
productive 
of 
the 
greatest 
advantage 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
and 
the 
common 
good, 
yet 
it 
is 
right, 
notwithstanding, 
to 
prefer 
the 
salvation, 
the 
life, 
or 
any 
other 
great 
advantage, 
even 
of 
a 
stranger, 
to 
an 
inconsiderable 
inconvenience 
of 
ourselvesor 
others. 


Good 
works, 
then, 
are 
those 
which 
are 
undertaken 
with 
a 
right 
intention 
for 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
and 
the 
public 
good. 
Under 
this 
class, 
therefore, 
are 
comprised 
the 
following: 
that 
each 
one 
should 
pursue 
his 
own 
calling 
— 
that 
is, 
apply 
himself 
to 
those 
duties 
for 
the 
successful 
discharge 
of 
which 
the 
talents 
and 
opportunities 
granted 
him 
by 
God 
appear 
to 
qualify 
him; 
that, 
in 
the 
next 
place, 
he 
should 
acquit 
himself 
accurately 
of 
the 
obligations 
of 
the 
public 
office 
or 
station 
in 
life 
which 
he 
has 
embraced, 
and 
labour 
to 
perfect 
the 
sphere 
which 
has 
been 
assigned 
to 
him; 
that, 
in 
his 
other 
relations, 
he 
should 
discharge 
towards 
all 
men 
the 
common 
offices 
of 
humanity; 
that 
he 
should 
not 
abandon, 
unless 
compelled 
by 
necessity, 
any 
one 
who 
is 
in 
peril, 
and 
whom 
it 
is 
in 
his 
power 
to 
assist; 
and 
that, 
even 
where 
his 
assistance 
is 
solicited 
in 
advancing 
the 
mere 
convenience 
of 
another, 
he 
should 
not 
withhold 
it, 
provided 
the 
advantage 
which 
is 
sought 
is 
not 
prejudicial 
to 
himself 
or 
others. 
And 
in 
general 
he 
should 
direct 
his 
thoughts 
so 
as 
to 



procure 
the 
greatest 
amount 
of 
good, 
and 
for 
the 
greatest 
possible 
number; 
and 
should 
seek, 
in 
all 
things, 
to 
advance 
the 
glory 
of 
God. 
The 
first 
care 
of 
the 
truly 
pious 
man, 
therefore, 
will 
be 
to 
be 
frugal 
of 
time, 
lest 
he 
should 
spend 
any 
portion 
of 
his 
life 
unprofitably; 
and 
he 
will 
abstain, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
even 
from 
allowable 
recreations; 
unless 
when, 
from 
his 
position 
in 
active 
life, 
he 
is 
drawn 
into 
places 
of 
public 
report, 
either 
by 
the 
necessary 
relaxation 
of 
mind 
and 
the 
care 
of 
health, 
or 
by 
the 
contingencies 
of 
business, 
or 
the 
decorous 
observances 
of 
society. 
For 
the 
austerity 
which 
would 
perpetually 
exclude 
every 
one 
from 
feasts, 
shows, 
games, 
dances, 
and 
the 
other 
amusements 
and 
exercises 
of 
courts, 
is 
no 
part 
of 
true 
piety: 
for 
these 
relaxations, 
in 
some 
cases, 
are 
not 
a 
waste 
of 
time, 
but 
useful 
instruments 
of 
business. 
It 
is 
right, 
however, 
that 
they 
should 
be 
indulged 
with 
discretion. 
And 
the 
virtuous 
man 
will 
shew 
by 
his 
conduct 
that 
they 
are 
but 
of 
secondary 
interest 
in 
his 
eyes, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
only 
through 
some 
necessity 
he 
is 
induced 
to 
takepartinthem. 


And 
as 
there 
are 
various 
ways, 
according 
to 
the 
condition 
and 
disposition 
of 
each 
individual, 
of 
advancing 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
and 
the 
welfare 
of 
men, 
either 
by 
actual 
service 
or 
by 
example, 
it 
is 
manifestly 
a 
source 
of 
great 
advantage 
that 
there 
should 
be 
in 
the 
Church 
a 
class 
distinct 
from 
those 
who 
are 
engaged 
in 
the 
active 
occupations 
and 
duties 
of 
every-day 
life 
— 
a 
class 
of 
ascetic 
and 
contemplative 
men, 
who, 
discarding 
the 
cares, 
and 
triumphing 
over 
the 
pleasures, 
of 
life, 
devote 
themselves 
entirely 
to 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
Deity, 
and 
the 
admiration 
of 
his 
works; 
or 
who, 
divesting 
themselves 
of 
all 
personal 
concerns, 
attend 
exclusively, 
and 
apply 
all 
their 
energies, 
to 
the 
relief 
of 
the 
necessities 
ofothers, 
either 
by 
instructing 
theignorantand 
erring, 
or 
by 
succouring 
the 
needy 
and 
distressed. 
Nor 
is 
it 
among 
the 
least 
of 
the 
reasons 
which 
commend 
that 
Church 
which 
alone 
has 
retained 
the 
name 
and 



badges 
of 
Catholic, 
that 
it 
is 
in 
her 
alone 
we 
see 
universally 
exhibited 
and 
encouragedeminentexamplesoftheexaltedvirtues 
andof 
the 
ascetic 
life. 


I 
confess, 
therefore, 
that 
I 
have 
always 
warmly 
approved 
of 
religious 
orders, 
of 
pious 
confraternities 
and 
associations, 
and 
similar 
praiseworthy 
institutions. 
For, 
provided 
they 
are 
purified 
from 
corruptions 
and 
abuses, 
governed 
according 
to 
the 
institutes 
of 
their 
founders, 
and 
regulated 
by 
the 
sovereign 
Pontiff 
for 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
entire 
Church, 
they 
seem 
to 
be, 
as 
it 
were, 
an 
army 
of 
heaven 
upon 
earth. 
For 
what 
can 
be 
more 
glorious 
than 
to 
carry 
the 
light 
of 
truth 
to 
distant 
nations, 
across 
the 
seas, 
and 
through 
fire 
and 
sword; 
to 
know 
no 
traffic 
but 
in 
the 
salvation 
of 
souls 
alone; 
to 
renounce 
every 
allurement 
of 
pleasure, 
even 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
conversation 
and 
of 
society, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
oneself 
to 
the 
contemplation 
of 
abstract 
truths, 
and 
to 
meditation 
on 
the 
things 
of 
God; 
to 
dedicate 
oneself 
to 
the 
training 
up 
of 
youthto 
learningand 
virtue;tocarry 
relief 
and 
assistancetothe 
wretched, 
the 
despairing, 
the 
abandoned, 
the 
captive, 
the 
condemned, 
in 
squalidness, 
in 
chains, 
in 
distant 
lands; 
and 
not 
to 
be 
deterred, 
even 
by 
the 
fear 
of 
pestilence, 
from 
these 
offices 
of 
prodigal 
charity! 
The 
man 
who 
knows 
not, 
or 
despises, 
these 
things, 
has 
but 
a 
plebeian 
and 
vulgar 
conception 
of 
virtue; 
he 
foolishly 
limits 
man’s 
obligations 
to 
God 
by 
the 
perfunctory 
discharge 
of 
every-day 
duties, 
and 
by 
that 
cold 
habit 
of 
life, 
without 
zeal, 
without 
spirit, 
by 
which 
men’s 
minds 
are 
commonly 
regulated. 
Whereas 
it 
is 
not 
a 
mere 
counsel, 
as 
some 
persuade 
themselves, 
but 
a 
precept, 
that 
every 
man, 
in 
every 
state 
of 
life, 
should 
strive, 
with 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
soul 
and 
body, 
towards 
Christian 
perfection; 
the 
practice 
of 
which 
perfection 
is 
not 
incompatible 
either 
with 
wedlock, 
or 
with 
the 
care 
of 
children, 
or 
with 
the 
occupations 
of 
office 
or 
of 
military 
life, 
though 
all 
these 
states 
increase 
the 
obstacles 
to 
its 
attainment. 
But 
the 
counsel 
is, 
to 
choose 
that 
state 
of 
life 
which 
is 
more 
free 
from 
earthly 
impediments;thechoice 
onwhichourLordcongratulated 
Magdalen. 



From 
the 
description 
of 
good 
works, 
however, 
let 
us 
come 
to 
their 
effect; 
and 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
this 
question 
I 
find 
that 
their 
meritoriousness 
is 
commonly 
disputed, 
and 
that 
the 
opinion 
which 
for 
so 
many 
ages 
had 
been 
received 
in 
the 
Church 
is 
grievously 
misrepresented, 
as 
being 
full 
of 
pharisaical 
presumption 
and 
pride. 
I 
think, 
however, 
that 
if 
the 
terms 
be 
rightlyexplained, 
nogroundof 
censurewillremain. 


We 
must 
bear 
in 
mind, 
therefore, 
that 
it 
is 
only 
by 
a 
certain 
analogy 
that 
the 
ideas 
of 
obligation 
and 
right 
are 
applied 
to 
us, 
in 
relation 
to 
God. 
For 
all 
things 
belong 
to 
God, 
because 
He 
created 
them, 
He 
preserves 
them, 
and 
He 
alone 
can 
wisely 
govern 
them. 
By 
virtue, 
therefore, 
of 
his 
supreme 
perfection, 
or 
of 
his 
supreme 
wisdom 
and 
power, 
God 
is 
naturally 
the 
Lord 
of 
all; 
and 
we 
are 
but 
servants, 
to 
whom, 
in 
order 
that 
we 
may 
trade 
thereon, 
He 
has 
given 
a 
certain 
portion, 
which 
Christ 
called 
“a 
talent.” 
Now, 
between 
the 
servant 
and 
the 
master 
there 
arises, 
with 
regard 
to 
this 
portion, 
merely 
an 
imaginary 
right, 
drawn 
from 
the 
master’s 
own 
kindness 
and 
condescension. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
— 
to 
employ 
another 
illustration 
— 
as 
while 
a 
master 
plays 
at 
chess 
with 
his 
slave, 
every 
one 
knows 
that 
whatever 
is 
won 
or 
lost 
is 
the 
master’s; 
but 
yet 
a 
sensible 
master 
will 
not 
derange 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
game 
by 
an 
ill-timed 
display 
of 
his 
authority. 
This 
explanation 
being 
pre-supposed 
and 
understood, 
we 
may 
speak 
securely, 
and 
without 
fear 
of 
censure, 
of 
an 
“as-ifobligation” 
on 
thepartofGod,anda 
right,or 
“as-if-right,” 
on 
ourownpart. 


Furthermore, 
as 
a 
right 
taken 
strictly 
is 
twofold; 
viz. 
a 
complete 
right, 
which 
gives 
an 
action, 
such 
as 
the 
right 
which 
arises 
from 
a 
contract; 
and 
an 
incomplete 
right, 
which 
produces 
an 
obligation, 
but 
gives 
no 
action 
of 
recovery, 
such 
as 
the 
right 
of 
the 
pauper 
to 
the 
alms 
which 
the 
rich 
man 
is 
bound 
to 
give 
him; 
so 
also 
our 
“as-if-right,” 
which 
produces 
an 
“as-ifobligation” 
in 
God, 
is 
twofold, 
viz. 
either 
“a 
right 
of 
congruity,” 
or 
“a 
right 
of 
condignness;” 
for 
it 
is 
congruous 
to 
God’s 
justice 
to 
reward 
those 
who 
love 



Him 
with 
eternal 
happiness; 
— 
not 
indeed 
that 
it 
is 
so 
absolutely, 
and 
from 
the 
sole 
consideration 
of 
justice 
(if 
we 
abstract 
from 
a 
promise), 
for 
a 
less 
retribution 
than 
this 
would 
suffice, 
but 
from 
the 
further 
consideration 
of 
his 
wisdom, 
inasmuch 
as 
He 
has 
decreed 
to 
diffuse 
throughout 
his 
kingdom 
the 
greatest 
amount 
of 
happiness 
of 
which 
it 
may 
be 
susceptible; 
for, 
this 
decree 
of 
his 
wisdom 
once 
being 
supposed, 
it 
belongs 
to 
distributive 
justice 
that, 
of 
those 
who 
love 
God, 
not 
merely 
some 
individuals, 
selected, 
as 
it 
were, 
with 
an 
acception 
of 
persons, 
but 
all, 
without 
any 
exception, 
should 
be 
admitted 
to 
eternalfelicity. 


God, 
however, 
has 
Himself 
undertaken 
a 
greater 
obligation, 
from 
which 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
we 
may 
derive 
even 
merit 
of 
condignness, 
and 
from 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
commutative 
justice, 
a 
more 
complete 
right 
arises 
in 
our 
favour. 
For 
God 
has 
entered 
into 
a 
contract 
with 
his 
Son, 
and, 
through 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ, 
we 
have 
been 
admitted 
into 
the 
same 
treaty. 
Now, 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
compact 
is, 
that, 
in 
virtue 
of 
Christ’s 
satisfaction 
and 
of 
our 
incorporation 
with 
Christ, 
and 
our 
reconciliation 
with 
God 
through 
faith 
and 
penance, 
not 
only 
are 
our 
sins 
effaced, 
but 
we 
are 
moreover 
made 
heirs 
of 
eternal 
life, 
and 
receive 
a 
title, 
provided 
we 
run 
and 
fight 
legitimately, 
to 
the 
crown 
of 
justice, 
and 
to 
the 
many 
and 
rich 
rewards, 
by 
which 
the 
elect 
themselves 
shall 
be 
distinguished 
one 
from 
another; 
for 
not 
even 
“a 
draught 
of 
cold 
water” 
given 
to 
the 
poor 
“shall 
go 
without 
reward,” 
since 
God, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
contract, 
crowns 
in 
us 
what 
is 
purely 
his 
own 
gift. 
Were 
it 
otherwise, 
we 
should 
be 
but 
“unprofitable 
servants,” 
who 
have 
done 
only 
what 
we 
were 
bound 
to 
do; 
nor 
could 
we 
allege 
any 
merit, 
or 
claim 
any 
reward. 


A 
further 
question 
has 
been 
raised, 
whether 
the 
regenerate 
can, 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
Divine 
grace, 
fulfil 
the 
law 
of 
God 
so 
perfectly 
as 
not 
to 
commit 
any 
mortal 
sin 
to 
which, 
of 
its 
own 
nature, 
eternal 
death 
is 
due. 
With 
reference 
to 



this 
question, 
as 
we 
must 
firmly 
hold 
that 
no 
wise 
legislator 
will 
prescribe 
impossibilities, 
we 
must 
also 
hold 
as 
certain, 
that 
to 
a 
man 
who 
has 
been 
reconciled 
with 
God, 
there 
is 
never 
wanting 
sufficient 
assistance 
on 
God’s 
part, 
and 
that 
he 
always 
possesses 
a 
power 
of 
fulfilling, 
provided 
he 
will 
it 
himself, 
not 
only 
each, 
but 
all, 
the 
precepts 
of 
the 
Divine 
law. 
For 
Christ 
has 
declared 
that 
“his 
yoke 
is 
sweet 
and 
his 
burden 
light;” 
and 
the 
possibility 
of 
fulfilling 
the 
law 
follows 
clearly 
from 
the 
fact, 
that 
the 
whole 
law 
requires 
on 
our 
part 
nothing 
more 
than 
seriously 
and 
sincerely 
to 
exert 
our 
will, 
and 
to 
love 
God 
with 
all 
our 
strength; 
nor 
do 
I 
see 
what 
there 
is 
that 
should 
render 
this 
love 
impossible 
to 
us, 
whereas 
even 
the 
innate 
idea 
which 
we 
have 
of 
God 
leads 
us 
to 
acknowledge 
his 
infinite 
loveliness; 
and 
the 
imperfection 
and 
unworthiness 
of 
all 
other 
objects 
are 
easily 
discovered 
by 
those 
who 
examine 
them. 


It 
must 
be 
confessed, 
however, 
that, 
amid 
the 
weakness 
and 
rebellion 
of 
the 
flesh 
and 
the 
manifold 
distractions 
which 
surround 
us, 
it 
is 
difficult 
always 
to 
preserve 
purity 
of 
mind; 
and 
that, 
in 
consequence, 
few 
individuals 
have 
lived 
exempt 
from 
mortal, 
and 
none 
from 
venial, 
errors. 
And 
indeed, 
were 
God 
to 
enter 
into 
judgment 
even 
with 
one 
who, 
after 
regeneration, 
had 
lived 
exempt 
from 
mortal 
sin, 
even 
such 
a 
man 
would 
have 
no 
defence 
against 
its 
rigour 
except 
in 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
Christ; 
for 
at 
the 
least, 
it 
was 
in 
consideration 
of 
this 
satisfaction 
that 
he 
received 
pardon 
of 
his 
past 
sins 
in 
the 
first 
instance; 
and 
if, 
since 
that 
pardon, 
he 
has 
lived 
a 
holy 
life, 
to 
what 
else 
does 
he 
owe 
it 
but 
to 
the 
Divine 
assistance, 
for 
which 
he 
is 
indebted 
to 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ? 
Hence 
no 
one 
should 
“glory 
save 
in 
the 
Lord,” 
with 
whom 
“we 
can 
do 
all 
things”andwhose 
powerisstrongintheweak. 


Having 
explained 
the 
reconciliation 
and 
renovation 
of 
man, 
and 
the 
fruits 
of 
the 
new 
life 
(which 
are 
the 
good 
works 
prescribed, 
by 
the 
law 
of 
God), 
it 



remains 
to 
consider 
the 
positive 
enactments 
which 
Christ 
has 
instituted 
and 
prescribed,inadditiontothecommon,natural, 
andperpetuallawofGod. 


We 
must 
recollect, 
therefore, 
that 
Christ 
is 
not 
only 
our 
Mediator, 
who 
by 
his 
merit 
and 
his 
passion 
has 
atoned 
for 
us 
and 
reconciled 
us 
to 
God, 
but 
also 
our 
Legislator, 
who, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
“all 
power 
given 
to 
Him 
in 
heaven 
and 
on 
earth,” 
has 
prescribed 
certain 
laws 
which 
cannot 
be 
despised 
without 
peril 
of 
salvation, 
while 
their 
observance 
will 
avail 
very 
much 
thereto. 
To 
this 
number, 
however, 
do 
not 
belong, 
as 
some 
persons 
imagine, 
the 
precept 
of 
bearinginjuries, 
of 
loving 
ourenemies, 
and 
otherduties 
ofthe 
samekind. 
For 
the 
love 
of 
enemies 
had 
been 
long 
before 
prescribed 
by 
the 
moral 
law. 
Nor 
does 
this 
precept 
forbid 
us 
to 
repress 
and 
punish 
the 
wicked, 
and 
to 
take 
such 
measures 
as 
may 
either 
ensure 
their 
correction, 
or, 
at 
least, 
may 
deprive 
them 
of 
the 
power 
of 
injuring; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
indeed, 
even 
charity 
to 
others 
prescribes 
this; 
and 
though 
we 
ought 
to 
love 
all, 
not 
even 
our 
enemies 
excepted, 
yet, 
in 
a 
case 
of 
conflicting 
interests, 
we 
should 
observe 
a 
certain 
proportion 
in 
dispensing 
our 
benefits. 
Hence 
the 
passage 
in 
which 
it 
is 
said 
that 
we 
should 
bear 
with 
injuries, 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
either 
as 
a 
counsel 
for 
those 
who 
select 
a 
life 
of 
seclusion 
and 
of 
special 
perfection 
and 
patience; 
or 
it 
signifies 
that 
we 
are 
not 
to 
resist 
a 
magistrate, 
even 
though 
he 
be 
a 
bad 
one; 
or 
it 
merely 
prohibits 
a 
desire 
of 
revenge, 
so 
that 
whatever 
is 
done 
against 
the 
wicked 
may 
be 
understood 
to 
be 
done 
solely 
from 
a 
motive 
of 
charity. 
The 
principles, 
therefore, 
of 
the 
Anabaptists, 
who 
interdict 
every 
pious 
man 
from 
public 
office 
and 
from 
military 
service, 
are 
grievously 
erroneous, 
and 
calculated 
to 
upturn 
human 
society; 
for 
who 
doesnot 
see 
that,ifthis 
principle 
were 
admitted, 
the 
service 
of 
the 
state 
would 
be 
deserted 
by 
good 
men, 
and 
that 
the 
supreme 
power 
would 
be 
thrown 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
its 
most 
abandoned 
members? 



The 
institutions 
of 
Christ 
in 
his 
character 
of 
Legislator 
consist 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
Divine 
worship 
which 
is 
peculiar 
to 
Christians, 
and 
the 
Sacraments 
of 
the 
newlaw. 
OftheSacramentsweshall 
speakhereafter. 


The 
distinctive 
character 
of 
Divine 
worship 
among 
Christians 
consists 
in 
our 
adoring 
in 
Christ-Man 
the 
almighty 
and 
eternal 
God, 
in 
our 
invoking 
Christ 
as 
the 
Mediator 
of 
salvation, 
and 
offering 
to 
God 
himself 
a 
perpetual 
Sacrifice 
of 
propitiation, 
viz. 
the 
Body 
and 
Blood 
of 
the 
Lord 
under 
the 
appearance 
of 
bread 
and 
wine, 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
Melchisedec, 
who 
prefigured 
Christ, 
the 
eternal 
Priest 
(the 
discussion 
of 
which 
subject 
we 
shall 
defer 
till 
we 
shall 
be 
considering 
the 
question 
of 
the 
Eucharist). 
To 
these 
may 
be 
subjoined 
the 
ceremonial 
observances 
which 
the 
Church 
has 
added 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
order 
and 
decency, 
and 
the 
practices 
connected 
with 
the 
veneration 
of 
the 
images 
and 
relics 
of 
saints, 
which 
partake 
somewhat 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
religious 
worship, 
and 
which, 
if 
freed 
from 
superstition 
and 
abuse, 
are 
not 
withouttheirutility. 
Oftheseweshallproceedtospeakunderdistinctheads. 


AsregardstheworshipofourSaviour,Paul 
hasexpressly 
declaredthat 
“in 
the 
name 
of 
Jesus” 
allmen,andinall 
places, 
“should 
bend 
the 
knee;” 
whence 
all 
Christians, 
not 
even 
excepting 
Socinians, 
agree 
that 
Christ 
is 
to 
be 
adored. 
Now 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
rightly 
teaches 
that, 
unless 
Christ 
were 
God, 
He 
could 
not 
be 
adored 
without 
idolatry; 
nor 
are 
Divine 
honours 
due 
to 
Him 
at 
all, 
except 
on 
account 
of 
the 
Divinity. 
For 
the 
sentence 
of 
the 
all-powerful 
and 
jealous 
God 
is 
fixed 
and 
unalterable: 
“I 
will 
not 
give 
my 
glory 
to 
another.” 
Hence 
I 
cannot 
assent 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
think 
that 
the 
right 
of 
Divinehonourhas 
been 
communicated 
to 
Christ’sHumanity 
in 
itself; 
an 
opinion 
defended 
not 
only 
by 
Socinians, 
but 
what 
is 
more 
surprising, 
by 
others 
also, 
misled 
by 
their 
principles 
regarding 
the 
“communication 
of 
properties.” 
Catholic 
teachers, 
however, 
with 
much 
more 
propriety, 
define 
that, 
although 
the 
highest 
perfection 
and 
the 
highest 
honour 
of 
which 
a 



creature 
is 
susceptible 
have 
been 
communicated 
to 
the 
Humanity 
by 
the 
Divinity, 
yet 
to 
the 
former, 
considered 
in 
itself, 
neither 
the 
properties 
nor 
the 
honoursoftheDivinitybelong. 


And 
this 
principle 
should 
be 
carefully 
observed, 
even 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
its 
practical 
bearing, 
lest, 
from 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
supreme 
and 
eternal 
Good, 
men’s 
minds 
may 
be 
withdrawn 
to 
the 
worship 
of 
man; 
and 
the 
Jews 
and 
Mahometans 
may 
thus 
be 
confirmed 
in 
the 
false 
opinion 
which 
they 
have 
conceivedregarding 
us, 
as 
if 
we 
adored 
aughtelsebut 
the 
oneAlmighty 
God. 
It 
was 
this 
false 
belief 
that 
gave 
rise 
to 
the 
fable, 
that 
the 
God 
of 
the 
Christians 
was 
given 
in 
pledge 
in 
the 
Host 
to 
one 
of 
the 
Sultans 
of 
Egypt; 
and 
to 
the 
bitter 
sarcasm 
of 
the 
Arabian 
philosopher, 
who 
declared, 
that 
“he 
had 
seen 
and 
heard 
of 
many 
ridiculous 
religions, 
but 
none 
more 
silly 
than 
the 
Christian, 
which 
commanded 
that 
its 
God 
should 
be 
eaten;” 
— 
a 
calumny 
which 
arose 
either 
from 
their 
hatred, 
or 
from 
the 
imprudence 
of 
members 
of 
ourownreligion. 


Nor 
can 
we 
regard 
the 
imperfect 
information 
of 
the 
people 
on 
this 
point, 
arising 
from 
the 
negligence 
of 
their 
teachers, 
as 
free 
from 
positive 
danger. 
For 
as 
the 
highest 
act 
of 
piety 
is 
that 
of 
the 
love 
of 
God 
above 
all 
things, 
derived 
from 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
perfection, 
goodness, 
and 
loveliness 
of 
his 
Divinity, 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
which 
the 
chief 
happiness 
of 
the 
soul 
consists, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
beware, 
lest, 
while 
we 
think 
we 
are 
eliciting 
an 
act 
of 
contrition 
and 
of 
Divine 
love, 
we 
stop 
short 
of 
this 
act, 
and 
rest 
our 
thoughts 
in 
the 
love 
and 
veneration 
of 
Christ’s 
Humanity 
alone; 
for 
although, 
in 
exciting 
the 
soul 
to 
increased 
fervour 
in 
acknowledging 
the 
Divine 
wisdom, 
justice, 
and 
goodness, 
as 
they 
are 
manifested 
in 
Christ, 
the 
consideration 
of 
his 
Humanity 
is 
more 
efficacious 
than 
that 
of 
all 
other 
creatures 
beside, 
yet 
it 
should 
hold 
the 
place 
but 
of 
a 
step, 
and 
not 
the 
highest 
and 
crowning 
point, 
in 
the 
worship 
of 
God. 
And 
yet 
this 
is 
a 
fault 
into 
which 



we 
commonly 
see 
preachers 
and 
writers 
fall, 
rather 
labouring 
in 
their 
words 
or 
writings 
to 
inflame 
the 
devotion 
of 
the 
people, 
by 
pandering 
to 
the 
imagination 
and 
to 
a 
certain 
sensual 
affection 
of 
the 
carnal 
mind, 
than 
seeking 
to 
inculcate 
the 
adoration 
of 
the 
invisible 
Deity, 
which 
consists 
“in 
spiritand 
intruth” 
and 
is 
the 
lastandhighest 
object 
of 
our 
worship. 
However, 
as 
the 
whole 
Christ, 
God 
and 
Man, 
is 
the 
object 
of 
adoration, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
both 
his 
most 
holy 
Soul 
and 
his 
most 
sacred 
Body 
are 
adored, 
not 
in 
themselves, 
but 
in 
virtue 
of 
their 
union 
with 
the 
Divinity, 
and 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
honour 
paid 
to 
them 
is 
resolved 
into 
that 
of 
the 
Divinity. 
And, 
to 
sum 
up 
in 
a 
few 
words,as 
it 
is 
theperson 
which 
is 
thus 
honoured, 
theactofadoration 
is 
directed 
to 
the 
Person 
of 
Christ; 
nor 
are 
we 
to 
imagine 
two 
adorations, 
but 
one 
only, 
which 
is 
directed 
to 
the 
whole 
Lord, 
the 
ultimate 
reason 
of 
which, 
however, 
is 
to 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
Divine 
Nature. 
And 
hence 
it 
was 
that 
the 
Council 
of 
Ephesus 
(chap. 
8) 
decreed 
that 
Emmanuel 
“should 
be 
venerated 
withonesupplication,andthat 
onegloryshouldberenderedtoHim.” 


Nevertheless,I 
do 
not 
agreewith 
those 
who, 
forgetful 
of 
human 
weakness, 
reject, 
under 
pretence 
of 
the 
“adoration 
in 
spirit 
and 
in 
truth,” 
every 
thing 
that 
strikes 
the 
senses 
and 
excites 
the 
imagination. 
For 
every 
one 
who 
seriously 
considers 
the 
nature 
of 
our 
mind 
as 
it 
exists 
in 
this 
body, 
will 
easily 
admit 
that, 
although 
we 
can 
form, 
within 
the 
mind, 
ideas 
of 
things 
which 
are 
outside 
of 
the 
sphere 
of 
sense, 
yet 
we 
are 
unable, 
notwithstanding, 
to 
fix 
our 
thoughts 
upon 
them, 
and 
to 
dwell 
on 
them 
with 
attention, 
unless 
there 
be 
superadded 
to 
the 
internal 
idea 
certain 
sensible 
signs, 
such 
as 
words, 
characters, 
representations, 
likenesses, 
examples, 
associations, 
or 
effects. 
The 
utility 
of 
these 
notes 
and 
memorials 
is 
proportioned 
to 
their 
greater 
significancy, 
and 
their 
greater 
power 
of 
representing 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
thing 
which 
they 
are 
intended 
to 
denote, 
especially 
if 
they 
be 
prominent 
and 
striking; 
— 
and 
it 
is 
even 
of 
advantage 
if 
they 
be 
of 
their 
own 
nature 



pleasing. 
They 
should 
be 
divested, 
however, 
of 
all 
superfluous 
ornaments, 
and 
of 
every 
thing 
which 
distracts 
rather 
than 
assists 
the 
mind. 
All 
these 
principles 
may 
be 
illustrated 
by 
the 
example 
of 
a 
manuscript, 
and 
they 
are 
equally 
applicable 
to 
the 
style 
of 
the 
author, 
and 
to 
the 
character 
of 
the 
scribe. 
Thus, 
in 
addition 
to 
an 
accurate 
exposition 
and 
delineation 
of 
his 
subject, 
an 
author 
may 
employ, 
not 
without 
advantage 
and 
credit, 
similes, 
examples, 
apothegms, 
nay 
even 
musical 
construction 
and 
harmonious 
cadence: 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
bombastic 
expressions, 
pedantic 
words, 
elaborate 
rhythmical 
arrangement, 
every 
species 
of 
affectation, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
every 
thing 
that 
does 
not 
soothe 
with 
insensible 
pleasure, 
but 
turns 
the 
mind 
away 
from 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
subject 
to 
the 
examination 
of 
these 
secondary 
things 
themselves, 
— 
all 
such 
things 
are 
unworthy 
of 
an 
orator 
who 
seeks 
to 
persuade 
the 
hearers 
or 
readers, 
and 
are 
only 
suited 
to 
the 
unsubstantial 
rhetorician, 
who 
declaims 
idly 
in 
the 
school 
to 
please 
the 
ear, 
and 
whose 
praise 
is 
not 
effective 
speaking, 
but 
a 
skilful 
display 
of 
figures. 
So 
also, 
from 
a 
scribe 
or 
a 
printer 
we 
look 
for 
clean 
and 
elegant 
paper, 
enduring 
ink, 
letters 
distinct, 
well 
turned, 
and 
flowing 
with 
a 
certain 
appearance 
of 
ease; 
but 
we 
do 
not 
desire 
figured 
paper, 
particoloured 
inks, 
and 
fantastic 
mazes 
of 
idle 
flourishes, 
running 
every 
where 
through 
the 
page; 
for 
all 
these 
things 
disturb 
and 
distract 
the 
reader. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
in 
sacred 
things: 
whatever 
leads 
the 
mind 
most 
effectually 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
God’s 
greatness 
and 
goodness, 
whatever 
excites 
our 
attention, 
produces 
pious 
thoughts, 
nay, 
whatever 
renders 
devotion 
sweet 
and 
grateful, 
all 
this 
is 
deserving 
of 
approval: 
but 
if 
the 
speaker 
betray 
excessive 
labour; 
if 
the 
hearers 
be 
carried 
away 
rather 
to 
admire 
his 
purity 
of 
diction, 
his 
elegance 
of 
gesture, 
and 
his 
erudition, 
than 
to 
love 
God, 
to 
confess 
their 
sins, 
and 
to 
amend 
their 
life; 
if 
it 
be 
the 
orator, 
rather 
than 
Christ, 
that 
is 
presented 
to 
the 
mind; 
if 
theatrical 
display 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
beauty 
of 
holy 
things; 
if 
the 
sacred 
music 
be 
designed 
rather 
to 



please 
the 
ears 
than 
to 
excite 
pious 
desires, 
— 
all 
this 
is 
to 
corrupt 
sincere 
devotion 
byprofane 
ornaments. 


Hence 
I 
am 
of 
opinion 
that 
God 
does 
not 
disregard, 
as 
unworthy 
of 
his 
service, 
the 
use 
of 
musical 
instruments, 
nor 
vocal 
harmony, 
nor 
beautiful 
hymns, 
nor 
sacred 
eloquence, 
nor 
lights, 
nor 
incense, 
nor 
precious 
vestments, 
jewelled 
vases, 
or 
other 
offerings; 
nor 
statues 
or 
graven 
images 
of 
pious 
objects; 
nor 
the 
laws 
of 
architecture 
and 
perspective, 
nor 
public 
processions, 
the 
chiming 
of 
bells, 
the 
strewing 
the 
streets 
with 
carpets, 
and 
the 
other 
expedients 
which 
the 
overflowing 
piety 
of 
the 
people 
has 
devised 
for 
the 
Divine 
honour, 
and 
which 
certain 
people, 
in 
their 
morose 
simplicity, 
despise. 
And 
this 
may 
be 
proved 
by 
arguments, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
examples. 
For 
the 
first 
fruits, 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
choicest 
flowers, 
of 
all 
things 
and 
of 
all 
arts 
are 
due 
to 
God. 
Of 
old, 
even 
in 
the 
very 
infancy 
of 
the 
art, 
it 
was 
believed, 
as 
it 
must 
even 
still 
be 
acknowledged, 
that 
poetry 
(which 
is 
but 
a 
more 
divine 
species 
of 
eloquence, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
language 
of 
angels,) 
could 
not 
be 
morenobly 
employedthaninsinging 
hymns,and 
in 
celebratingthe 
praisesof 
God 
with 
all 
the 
elegance 
of 
which 
it 
was 
susceptible. 
We 
must 
admit 
the 
same 
of 
music 
— 
the 
twin-sister 
of 
poetry; 
nor 
can 
the 
most 
eminent 
architects 
more 
suitably 
display 
their 
art, 
or 
the 
mightiest 
princes 
their 
magnificence, 
than 
in 
constructing 
and 
procuring 
the 
construction 
of 
temples 
or 
basilics, 
and 
other 
works 
destined 
to 
the 
honour 
of 
God 
and 
the 
purposes 
of 
piety. 
In 
the 
Holy 
Scripture 
we 
have 
the 
example 
of 
God 
himself; 
for 
it 
was 
in 
obediencetohis 
commands 
thatMoses 
constructedthe 
tabernacle, 
and 
Solomon 
the 
temple; 
and 
we 
read 
that 
David 
employed 
choirs, 
hymns, 
organs, 
and 
cymbals, 
in 
the 
praises 
of 
God. 
And 
although 
there 
is 
no 
temple 
more 
worthy 
of 
God 
than 
a 
pure 
mind, 
no 
music 
sweeter 
than 
fervent 
prayer, 
no 
incense 
more 
grateful 
than 
the 
odour 
of 
sanctity, 
no 
offering 
more 
noble 
than 
alms-deeds; 
and 
although 
“well-ordered 
justice 
and 
righteousness 
of 



soul” 
are 
commended, 
even 
by 
a 
profane 
writer, 
as 
more 
precious 
than 
gold 
in 
religious 
worship; 
yet 
we 
are 
not 
to 
overlook 
external 
things, 
because 
they 
are 
less 
to 
be 
prized 
than 
internal; 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
our 
innate 
reason 
directs 
us 
to 
respect 
and 
honour 
friends 
and 
princes, 
not 
only 
by 
real 
service 
and 
by 
acts, 
but 
also 
by 
words, 
by 
gestures, 
and 
by 
every 
indication 
of 
love 
and 
honour. 
And 
our 
Lord 
rebuked 
those 
who 
were 
indignant 
because 
the 
vessel 
of 
precious 
unguent 
was 
poured 
out 
in 
his 
honour, 
as 
though 
the 
price 
had 
been 
more 
fitly 
turned 
to 
the 
uses 
of 
the 
poor. 
For 
God 
has 
given 
to 
mortals 
abundant 
means 
of 
satisfying 
both 
offices; 
and 
by 
the 
wise 
discipline 
of 
pious 
antiquity, 
it 
was 
ordained 
that 
of 
that 
portion 
of 
the 
sacred 
revenues 
which 
remained 
after 
the 
support 
of 
the 
clergy, 
part 
should 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
poor 
and 
to 
works 
of 
charity, 
and 
part 
to 
the 
erection 
of 
basilics, 
and 
other 
expensesofasimilar 
nature. 


The 
question 
regarding 
the 
worship 
of 
images, 
viz. 
how 
far 
it 
is 
lawful 
to 
use 
them 
in 
religion, 
and, 
through 
them, 
to 
render 
honour 
to 
the 
prototype, 
is 
of 
greater 
importance. 
For 
it 
certainly 
cannot 
be 
supposed 
that 
God 
would, 
without 
grave 
reason, 
have 
interdicted 
to 
his 
people 
all 
use 
of 
graven 
things, 
and 
have 
prohibited 
the 
making 
of 
images 
lest 
they 
might 
be 
used 
as 
idols. 
The 
ancient 
Church 
also, 
in 
the 
first 
ages, 
as 
we 
learn 
from 
the 
Council 
of 
Elvira 
and 
from 
other 
passages 
of 
the 
ancients, 
did 
not 
admit 
images 
into 
the 
oratories, 
or 
at 
least 
not 
without 
great 
difficulty. 
At 
a 
later 
period, 
the 
bishops 
of 
Gaul 
and 
Germany, 
in 
the 
Council 
of 
Frankfort, 
held 
under 
Charlemagne, 
bitterly 
inveighed 
against 
the 
image-worshippers 
of 
the 
East 
and 
the 
second 
Council 
of 
Nice. 
And 
indeed, 
this 
controversy 
gave 
occasion 
to 
many 
wars, 
tumults, 
and 
revolutions 
in 
the 
East, 
and 
was 
not 
the 
least 
among 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
Asia. 
The 
Jews 
too, 
and 
Saracens, 
have 
held 
the 
veneration 
which 
is 
paid 
to 
images 
among 
the 
other 
reasons 
of 
their 
hatred 
against 
Christians; 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
denied 
that, 
even 
at 
an 
early 
period, 
many 
abuses 
in 



divine 
worship 
had 
gained 
ground 
among 
the 
people; 
and 
that 
one 
among 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
success 
of 
Mahomet 
and 
his 
followers, 
was 
their 
pretended 
boast 
of 
restoring 
the 
worship 
of 
the 
one 
God. 
The 
partisans 
of 
the 
Reformation 
in 
the 
last 
century, 
also, 
found 
a 
plausible 
colour 
for 
their 
undertaking,inthe 
verysameprofession. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
use 
of 
images 
in 
worship 
appears 
clearly 
to 
be 
founded 
on 
principles 
of 
utility 
and 
reason. 
What 
object 
have 
we 
in 
reading 
or 
listening 
to 
histories, 
but 
in 
order 
that 
the 
images 
which 
they 
represent 
may 
be 
painted 
on 
our 
memory? 
Now 
as 
these 
images 
are 
of 
themselves 
very 
fleeting, 
and 
are 
not 
always 
sufficiently 
distinct 
and 
clear, 
we 
should 
gratefully 
acknowledge, 
as 
a 
great 
gift 
of 
God, 
the 
arts 
of 
painting 
and 
sculpture, 
through 
whose 
aid 
we 
obtain 
enduring 
images, 
representing 
the 
objects 
with 
the 
utmost 
accuracy, 
vividness, 
and 
beauty; 
by 
the 
sight 
of 
which 
(in 
the 
impossibility 
of 
referring 
to 
the 
originals) 
the 
internal 
images 
may 
be 
renewed, 
and, 
like 
the 
impression 
of 
a 
seal 
on 
wax, 
more 
deeply 
imprinted 
upon 
the 
mind, 
And 
as 
the 
use 
of 
images 
possesses 
such 
advantages, 
in 
what 
circumstances, 
I 
ask, 
can 
it 
be 
more 
fitly 
introduced, 
than 
in 
those 
in 
which 
it 
is 
of 
greatest 
moment 
that 
the 
images 
impressed 
upon 
our 
memory 
should 
be 
especially 
lasting 
and 
vivid, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
concerns 
of 
piety 
and 
of 
the 
Divine 
honour? 
And 
this 
is 
especially 
true, 
because, 
as 
I 
have 
observed 
above, 
the 
worship 
of 
God 
is, 
pre-eminently, 
the 
most 
fitting 
field 
forthedisplayofalltheartsand 
sciences,andthereforealsoofpainting. 


To 
one 
who 
considers 
these 
things, 
it 
must 
be 
clear 
beyond 
all 
doubt, 
that 
if 
the 
law 
of 
God 
and 
certain 
holy 
men 
chose 
to 
prohibit, 
at 
certain 
times 
and 
in 
certain 
places, 
a 
thing 
which 
in 
itself 
is 
harmless, 
and 
indeed 
which, 
if 
religiously 
practised, 
is 
eminently 
useful, 
it 
was 
solely 
because 
it 
might 
give 
occasion 
to 
grievous 
abuses, 
against 
which 
it 
was 
difficult 
to 
guard 
in 
those 
times. 
Wemustsee,then, 
inwhattheseabuses 
chieflyconsist. 



In 
the 
first 
place, 
therefore, 
before 
the 
written 
law 
was 
promulgated 
by 
God, 
and 
while 
his 
true 
worship 
was 
propagated 
solely 
by 
the 
tradition 
of 
the 
elders, 
many 
men 
came 
to 
forget 
the 
one 
infinite 
and 
invisible 
Creator 
of 
all 
things, 
and 
fell 
away 
into 
the 
worship 
of 
those 
things 
which 
were 
within 
reach 
of 
their 
imagination, 
the 
sun, 
the 
moon, 
the 
stars, 
the 
heaven, 
and 
the 
elements. 
By 
degrees, 
either 
through 
the 
ambition 
of 
tyrants, 
or, 
in 
some 
cases, 
through 
the 
veneration 
entertained 
for 
men 
of 
eminent 
merit, 
it 
came 
to 
passthatmortalswereelevatedintogods. 
Andalthough 
there 
were 
somewho 
worshipped 
one 
particular 
God 
as 
superior 
to 
all 
the 
rest, 
yet 
the 
superiority 
which 
they 
attributed 
to 
Him 
was 
not 
that 
of 
a 
being 
removed 
from 
the 
others 
by 
an 
infinite 
interval, 
but 
only 
that 
of 
a 
more 
excellent 
man 
among 
his 
fellow-men. 
Now 
the 
use 
of 
images 
and 
statues 
tended 
very 
much 
to 
promote 
this 
perverted 
worship. 
For 
in 
these, 
men 
had 
before 
their 
eyes 
perpetual 
incentives 
to 
the 
corrupt 
inclination 
which 
had 
gradually 
grown 
inveterate; 
and, 
by 
representing 
to 
themselves 
the 
dead 
as 
living, 
they 
fostered 
this 
most 
erroneous 
conception 
of 
the 
Divinity. 
And 
at 
last, 
when, 
by 
degrees, 
their 
superstition 
began 
to 
imagine 
that 
there 
existed, 
and 
indeed 
that 
there 
had 
actually 
been 
observed, 
in 
the 
statues, 
certain 
mysterious 
signs 
of 
the 
presence 
and 
even 
of 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
gods, 
which 
the 
interested 
priests 
circulated 
or 
exaggerated 
through 
the 
desire 
of 
gain, 
they 
came 
thence 
to 
think 
that 
there 
dwelt 
in 
the 
statues 
themselves 
some 
peculiar 
virtue 
of 
the 
Divinity. 


To 
these 
corruptions 
of 
the 
Gentiles, 
the 
patriarchs, 
who 
remained 
true 
to 
the 
worship 
of 
the 
invisible 
Substance, 
strenuously 
opposed 
themselves. 
One 
of 
these, 
Abraham, 
bound 
himself 
by 
a 
peculiar 
treaty 
to 
the 
true 
God, 
and 
by 
this 
religious 
rite 
happily 
secured 
the 
fidelity 
of 
his 
posterity. 
Certainly, 
it 
was 
chiefly 
through 
those 
races 
which 
are 
regarded 
as 
descendants 
of 
Abraham 
that 
the 
worship 
of 
the 
one 
God 
was 
preserved, 
and 
was 
by 
degrees 



again 
diffused 
among 
the 
other 
nations. 
And 
when 
Israel, 
who 
was 
the 
grandson 
of 
Abraham, 
was 
driven 
by 
famine 
to 
go 
down 
into 
Egypt, 
and 
the 
Israelites 
had 
multiplied 
there, 
it 
pleased 
God, 
lest 
their 
constancy 
should 
be 
gradually 
undermined 
by 
the 
contagious 
influence 
of 
this 
most 
superstitious 
nation, 
to 
lead 
forth 
his 
chosen 
people 
with 
a 
strong 
hand 
from 
the 
slavery 
of 
Pharaoh, 
and 
to 
give 
them 
new 
laws 
through 
the 
mouth 
of 
Moses; 
one 
of 
which 
interdicted 
them 
from 
all 
use, 
or 
at 
least 
all 
sacred 
use, 
of 
images, 
in 
order 
that 
they 
might 
the 
better 
be 
preserved 
pure 
from 
idol-worship, 
which 
was 
then 
almost 
universally 
received. 
Perhaps 
the 
same 
reason 
continued 
in 
force 
among 
the 
early 
Christians; 
and 
in 
the 
designs 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
holy 
men 
of 
that 
age, 
it 
seemed 
more 
safe 
to 
lean 
to 
the 
opposite 
side, 
and 
to 
dispense 
altogetherwith 
amatter 
whichinitself 
isgood 
anduseful,butstill 
is 
unessential, 
than 
to 
expose 
souls 
yet 
tender 
and 
ill 
confirmed 
in 
the 
faith, 
to 
dangerof 
idolatry. 


And 
hence, 
if 
there 
existed, 
even 
at 
the 
present 
day, 
great 
reason 
for 
caution, 
and 
a 
fear 
that 
their 
use 
would 
lead 
to 
idolatry, 
I 
doubt 
not 
that 
it 
might 
be 
right 
to 
deal 
with 
images, 
as 
Ezechias 
did 
with 
the 
brazen 
serpent, 
though 
this 
had 
been 
set 
up 
by 
the 
order 
of 
God 
himself. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
also, 
it 
would 
be 
advisable 
to 
abstain 
from 
introducing 
them 
among 
a 
people 
who 
would, 
perhaps, 
be 
deterred 
from 
embracing 
Christianity 
by 
their 
detestation 
of 
images; 
— 
a 
contingency 
which 
may 
yet 
arise, 
among 
the 
Arabs, 
the 
Persians, 
the 
Scythians, 
and 
the 
other 
nations 
of 
the 
East, 
if 
it 
shall 
please 
God 
to 
favour 
the 
arms, 
or 
rather 
the 
preaching, 
of 
the 
Christians, 
and 
tobringon 
the 
fataldayofthe 
Mahometandomination. 


Hence, 
when 
all 
the 
reasons 
are 
carefully 
balanced, 
we 
must 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion, 
that 
the 
law 
of 
God, 
if 
any 
such 
law 
existed, 
against 
the 
use 
of 
images, 
and 
even 
against 
such 
a 
worship 
of 
them 
as 
does 
not 
trench 
in 
any 
way 
upon 
the 
Divine 
honour, 
was 
merely 
a 
ceremonial 
precept; 
that 
it 
was 



but 
temporary 
in 
its 
nature, 
and 
perhaps 
was 
retained 
for 
a 
while 
by 
the 
first 
Christians, 
on 
account 
of 
grave 
reasons; 
— 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
the 
law 
of 
the 
Sabbath-day, 
and 
that 
concerning 
the 
use 
of 
“blood 
and 
things 
strangled,” 
which, 
though 
enforced 
by 
a 
much 
more 
express 
passage 
of 
the 
New 
Testament, 
nevertheless 
fell 
into 
disuse 
among 
the 
majority 
of 
Christians, 
as 
soonas 
the 
reasonforobservingthemwas 
atanend. 


Indeed, 
there 
are 
examples 
which 
prove 
that 
it 
admitted 
of 
dispensation, 
even 
among 
the 
Jews; 
for 
although 
the 
law 
appears 
utterly 
to 
prohibit 
images 
and 
graven 
things, 
yet 
(not 
to 
speak 
of 
likenesses 
of 
inanimate 
objects) 
we 
read 
of 
the 
golden 
cherubim 
and 
the 
brazen 
serpent 
which 
were 
constructed 
by 
Moses; 
and 
of 
other 
cherubim, 
and 
oxen, 
and 
lions, 
which 
were 
made 
by 
Solomon, 
and, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
were 
set 
up 
even 
in 
the 
holy 
place, 
some 
of 
which 
were 
expressly 
ordered, 
and 
others 
at 
least 
approved. 
And 
although 
it 
appears 
more 
probable 
that, 
in 
the 
origin 
of 
Christianity, 
there 
were 
no 
images 
in 
the 
oratories, 
or 
very 
few, 
(for 
we 
find 
mention 
in 
Tertullian 
of 
one 
image 
of 
Christ, 
under 
the 
form 
of 
The 
Good 
Shepherd 
seeking 
the 
Lost 
Sheep, 
graven 
on 
the 
sacred 
chalices,) 
yet 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
they 
were 
gradually 
received 
into 
use; 
and 
St. 
Gregory, 
Bishop 
of 
Nyssa, 
describes 
a 
picture 
ofthe 
sufferings 
of 
acertain 
martyr, 
as 
elaboratelypainted 
on 
the 
wall 
ofatemple: 
—to 
passoverothertestimonies 
for 
the 
present. 


But 
as 
regards 
the 
actual 
veneration 
of 
images, 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that, 
through 
fear 
of 
superstition, 
Christians 
long 
abstained 
therefrom, 
especially 
as 
long 
as 
pagans 
were 
still 
intermingled 
with 
them 
in 
considerable 
numbers. 
But 
when 
the 
worship 
of 
demons 
was 
at 
last 
exploded 
throughout 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
the 
known 
and 
civilised 
world, 
and 
when 
the 
gods 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
mentioned 
except 
in 
jest, 
even 
grave 
men 
no 
longer 
saw 
cause 
why 
images, 
which 
are 
the 
alphabet 
of 
the 
unlearned, 
and 
which 
to 
the 
simple 
people 
supply 
agreatincentivetopiety,should 
beexcludedfromworship. 



Nevertheless, 
the 
iconoclast 
contests 
in 
the 
East, 
and 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
fathers 
of 
Frankfort, 
shew 
that 
opinion 
long 
continued 
to 
fluctuate; 
and 
even 
St. 
Gregory, 
surnamed 
the 
Great, 
the 
Pontiff 
of 
the 
Roman 
Church, 
who 
lived 
still 
earlierthanthese,appearsto 
havevariedin 
hissentiments. 
For, 
inaletter 
to 
Serenus, 
Bishop 
of 
Marseilles, 
he 
approves 
of 
his 
having 
forbidden 
the 
adoration 
of 
images, 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
rebukes 
him 
for 
having 
broken 
them. 
And 
yet, 
writing 
to 
one 
Secundinus, 
to 
whom 
he 
had 
sent 
an 
image 
of 
the 
Saviour, 
he 
says: 
“We 
do 
not 
prostrate 
ourselves 
before 
it 
as 
before 
a 
Divinity, 
but 
we 
adore 
Him, 
of 
whom 
we 
are 
reminded 
by 
the 
image 
that 
He 
was 
born, 
or 
that 
He 
suffered, 
and 
that 
now 
He 
sitteth 
upon 
the 
throne.” 
Now 
this 
proves, 
not 
obscurely, 
that 
Gregory 
was 
wont 
to 
adore 
Christ 
in 
presence 
of 
an 
image, 
or 
turned 
toward 
an 
image. 
And 
this, 
as 
I 
shall 
state 
hereafter, 
is 
precisely 
what 
others 
call 
adoration 
of 
images. 
And 
thus 
Gregory 
appears, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
scandal, 
to 
have 
accommodated 
himself 
to 
those 
to 
whom 
he 
wrote, 
in 
a 
matter 
which 
he 
deemed 
of 
itself 
indifferent; 
for 
the 
practice 
of 
venerating 
images 
came 
but 
tardily 
into 
use 
in 
Gaul, 
and 
was 
much 
earlier 
in 
the 
East 
and 
in 
Italy. 
And 
a 
priest, 
named 
Claudius, 
who 
was 
sent 
from 
Gaul 
into 
Italy, 
by 
Louis 
the 
Pious, 
and 
was 
made 
Bishop 
of 
Turin 
on 
account 
of 
his 
learning, 
relates 
that 
he 
incurred 
danger 
by 
resisting 
the 
worship 
of 
images, 
as 
appears 
from 
the 
work 
of 
Jonas 
of 
Orleans, 
who 
wrote 
a 
refutation 
of 
his 
doctrine. 
The 
reason 
of 
this 
difference, 
I 
think, 
may 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
different 
genius 
of 
the 
nations; 
for 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
latter 
countries 
have 
always 
been 
of 
a 
more 
vivid 
imagination, 
and 
therefore 
more 
given 
to 
ceremonies. 
Whence 
we 
find 
that 
they 
paid 
to 
the 
statues 
of 
Emperors 
and 
Kings 
the 
same 
honours 
as 
to 
the 
prince 
in 
person 
— 
a 
thing 
almost 
unknown 
in 
Gaul 
and 
Germany. 
It 
is 
not 
strange, 
therefore, 
that 
those 
nations 
should 
regard 
with 
horror, 
as 
a 
sacrilege, 
the 
denial 
in 
other 
countries 
of 
that 
honour 
which 
they 
themselves 
pay 
to 
the 
images 
of 
Christ 
and 
the 
Saints, 
(though 



this 
may 
sometimes 
have 
been 
from 
a 
good 
and 
laudable 
zeal); 
because 
they 
see 
the 
prototype 
present, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
the 
image; 
for 
they 
pursue 
the 
associations 
to 
a 
greater 
length 
in 
their 
mind, 
and 
therefore 
their 
imagination 
is 
more 
delicate 
and 
exquisite. 
And 
yet 
the 
same 
nations, 
when 
imbued 
with 
the 
contrary 
opinion, 
may 
fall 
into 
excess 
on 
the 
opposite 
side; 
as, 
for 
instance, 
we 
find 
that 
the 
Mahometans 
cannot 
tolerate 
pictures 
of 
living 
things 
even 
in 
profane 
use. 
By 
degrees, 
however, 
Gaul 
and 
Germany, 
and 
almost 
the 
whole 
Christian 
world, 
followed 
the 
example 
of 
the 
East 
and 
Italy, 
and 
continued 
soto 
dountilthechanges 
ofthelast 
century. 


But 
before 
we 
lay 
down 
the 
principles 
which 
are 
to 
be 
held 
regarding 
the 
received 
worship 
of 
images, 
we 
must 
see 
in 
what 
it 
consists; 
and 
this 
we 
cannot 
ascertain 
better 
than 
from 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent, 
which 
run 
thus: 
“Moreover 
[let 
the 
bishops 
teach] 
that 
the 
images 
of 
Christ, 
of 
the 
Virgin 
Mother 
of 
God, 
and 
the 
other 
Saints, 
are 
to 
be 
had 
and 
retained, 
especially 
in 
temples, 
and 
due 
honour 
and 
veneration 
paid 
to 
them: 
not 
that 
we 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
in 
them 
any 
divinity 
or 
virtue 
on 
account 
of 
which 
they 
are 
to 
be 
worshipped, 
or 
that 
any 
thing 
is 
to 
be 
asked 
from 
them, 
or 
that 
trust 
is 
to 
be 
placed 
in 
them, 
as 
was 
done 
of 
old 
by 
the 
Gentiles, 
who 
‘placed 
their 
hope 
in 
idols;’ 
but 
because 
the 
honour 
which 
is 
shewn 
them 
is 
referred 
to 
the 
originals 
which 
they 
represent: 
so 
that, 
through 
the 
images 
which 
we 
kiss,and 
beforewhich 
we 
bare 
the 
head 
and 
prostrate 
ourselves, 
webut 
adore 
Christ 
andveneratethe 
Saints,whoselikenesstheybear.” 


The 
decree 
subjoins, 
that 
“through 
the 
histories 
of 
the 
mysteries 
of 
our 
redemption, 
as 
expressed 
by 
pictures 
or 
other 
representations, 
the 
people 
are 
instructed, 
and 
are 
strengthened 
in 
recalling 
and 
assiduously 
meditating 
on 
the 
articles 
of 
faith; 
and 
furthermore, 
that 
great 
fruit 
is 
derived 
from 
all 
images, 
not 
only 
because 
they 
recall 
to 
the 
minds 
of 
the 
people 
the 
benefits 
and 
gifts 
which 
they 
have 
received 
from 
Christ, 
but 
also 
because 
by 
them 
the 



wonders 
of 
God, 
wrought 
through 
the 
Saints, 
and 
their 
saying 
examples, 
are 
setbeforetheeyesof 
thefaithful;to 
theendthatthey 
may 
give 
thanks 
toGod 
for 
them, 
that 
they 
may 
compose 
their 
lives 
and 
morals 
to 
the 
imitation 
of 
the 
Saints, 
and 
may 
be 
excited 
to 
adore 
and 
love 
God, 
and 
to 
cherish 
piety.” 
In 
these 
words 
of 
the 
Council 
I 
do 
not 
see 
what 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
censure. 
And 
it 
is 
afterwards 
added, 
that 
“the 
holy 
synod 
anxiously 
desires 
the 
suppression 
of 
theabuseswhichhavecreptin.” 


But, 
to 
discuss 
the 
matter 
more 
distinctly, 
we 
must 
reflect, 
that 
the 
honour 
paid 
to 
imagesisof 
two 
kinds:the 
first, 
the 
honour 
which 
properly 
belongs 
to 
the 
image 
itself, 
as 
its 
being 
set 
in 
a 
prominent 
and 
honourable 
place, 
adorned, 
set 
off 
with 
lights, 
carried 
in 
procession; 
— 
and 
this 
honour, 
I 
think, 
presents 
but 
little 
difficulty, 
and 
will 
easily 
be 
tolerated 
by 
any 
one 
who 
does 
not 
think 
that 
images 
are 
to 
be 
rejected 
altogether: 
— 
the 
second, 
which 
is 
referred 
to 
the 
original, 
and 
which 
demands 
more 
diligent 
examination; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
veneration 
of 
images 
regarding 
which 
the 
controversy 
arises. 
Such, 
for 
instance, 
is 
the 
act 
of 
men 
kissing 
an 
image, 
bowing 
the 
head 
before 
it, 
bending 
the 
knee, 
prostrating, 
pouring 
forth 
prayers, 
making 
vows, 
offering 
praises, 
or 
giving 
thanks. 
But 
indeed, 
although 
by 
the 
established 
use 
of 
language, 
the 
honour 
is 
said 
to 
be, 
in 
such 
case, 
paid 
to 
the 
image, 
yet 
in 
reality, 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
the 
Council 
explains 
the 
honour 
to 
be 
rendered 
to 
images, 
the 
object 
to 
which 
the 
honour 
is 
referred 
is 
not 
the 
thing, 
which 
is 
inanimate 
and 
incapable 
of 
honour, 
but 
the 
original, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
image, 
or 
through 
the 
image. 
And 
hence 
it 
was, 
I 
suppose, 
that 
some 
scholastics 
maintained 
that 
the 
adoration 
paid 
to 
the 
image 
of 
Christ 
is 
the 
same 
supreme 
worship 
of 
Latria 
as 
that 
of 
the 
Lord 
Christ 
himself. 
For 
this 
act 
which 
is 
called 
adoration 
of 
the 
image, 
is 
in 
reality 
but 
adoration 
of 
Christ 
himself, 
suggested 
by 
occasion, 
and 
in 
consideration, 
of 
the 
image, 
to 
which 
the 
body 
is 
turned 
as 
to 
Christ 
himself, 
in 
order 
that 
his 
presence 
may 
be 



presented 
more 
forcibly, 
and 
the 
mind 
may 
be 
more 
sensibly 
elevated 
to 
the 
contemplation 
of 
the 
Lord. 
For 
no 
man 
in 
his 
senses 
will 
intend 
to 
say, 
“O 
image, 
grant 
my 
petition!” 
“To 
thee, 
O 
marble!” 
or 
“O 
stone, 
I 
give 
thanks”“ 
but 
“Thee,O 
Lord, 
I 
adore! 
to 
Thee 
I 
sing 
praises!” 
In 
these 
times, 
nevertheless, 
it 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
useful, 
and 
conducive 
to 
piety, 
to 
abstain, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
avoiding 
scandal, 
from 
all 
those 
expressions 
of 
the 
scholastics 
which 
convey 
that 
an 
image 
is 
to 
be 
reverenced 
with 
the 
Divine 
honour 
of 
Latvia; 
phrases 
which 
the 
Council 
has 
prudently 
avoided, 
and 
of 
which 
itsufficientlyconveysitsdisapproval. 


Supposing, 
therefore, 
that 
no 
other 
species 
of 
veneration 
of 
images 
is 
admitted 
than 
simply 
the 
veneration 
of 
the 
original 
in 
presence 
of 
the 
image, 
there 
will 
no 
more 
be 
idolatry 
in 
this 
practice, 
than 
in 
the 
veneration 
which 
is 
shewn 
to 
God 
and 
to 
Christ, 
when 
his 
most 
sacred 
name 
is 
pronounced. 
For 
names, 
too, 
are 
signs, 
and, 
indeed, 
far 
inferior 
to 
images 
in 
significancy; 
for 
they 
are 
much 
less 
perfect 
representations 
of 
the 
object. 
When 
an 
image, 
therefore, 
is 
said 
to 
be 
honoured, 
the 
act 
should 
not 
be 
understood 
in 
any 
other 
sense 
than 
when 
it 
is 
said 
that 
“in 
the 
name 
of 
Jesus 
the 
knee 
is 
bowed,” 
that 
“the 
name 
of 
the 
Lord 
is 
blessed,” 
that 
“glory 
is 
given 
to 
his 
name” 
And

The 
Council 
wisely 
cautions 
us 
not 
to 
believe 
that 
any 
“virtue 
or 
divinity 
existsanddwellsin 
theimageitself 
a 
superstitiousbeliefsimilar 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Trojans, 
who 
thought 
that 
the 
city 
would 
fall, 
if 
the 
Palladium 
were 
taken 
away; 
and 
of 
the 
Romans, 
who 
used 
a 
set 
form 
of 
words 
in 
order 
to 
call 
out 
the 
gods 
from 
the 
enemies’ 
temples, 
and 
believed 
that 
the 
god 
himself 
was 
transferred 
along 
with 
the 
image; 
and 
of 
some 
among 
the 
Gentiles, 
who 
were 
convinced 
that 
carrying 
the 
statue 
of 
a 
particular 
god 
in 
procession 
would 



ensure 
success: 
of 
which 
superstitions 
concerning 
images, 
the 
Arabs 
still 
retain 
a 
trace 
in 
certain 
figures 
and 
talismans; 
and 
the 
Jews, 
in 
certain 
written 
or 
spoken 
names;which 
undoubtedly 
implies 
anadoration 
of 
theimages 
or 
of 
thenames. 


No 
less 
wisely 
did 
the 
Council 
add, 
that 
“neither 
is 
trust 
to 
be 
placed 
in 
images;” 
as 
if, 
for 
example, 
devotion 
would 
be 
less 
grateful 
to 
God, 
or 
prayers 
less 
efficacious, 
if 
the 
image 
chanced 
to 
be 
removed, 
or 
lost, 
or 
changed; 
which 
is 
certainly 
a 
superstitious 
belief. 
And 
we 
must 
maintain 
in 
like 
manner 
regarding 
relics, 
that 
their 
loss 
or 
even 
their 
spuriousness, 
would 
not 
prejudice 
the 
prayer 
of 
the 
suppliants, 
provided 
their 
piety 
continued 
the 
same. 
Forwemustalso 
hold,thatvisitsundertaken, 
eithervoluntarily 
orfrom 
vow, 
to 
certain 
places 
of 
especial 
sanctity, 
and 
other 
similar 
works, 
are 
sometimes 
profitable 
to 
piety; 
for 
even 
the 
very 
journey 
and 
the 
other 
details 
of 
the 
undertaking 
form 
part 
of 
the 
honour; 
and 
the 
discipline 
of 
soul, 
the 
penance 
and 
obligation 
voluntarily 
undertaken, 
the 
peculiar 
manifestation 
of 
fervour 
and 
zeal, 
and 
the 
union 
of 
our 
private 
tribute 
to 
God’s 
honour 
with 
the 
public 
expression 
of 
the 
piety 
of 
the 
assembled 
people, 
are 
all 
acts 
worthy 
of 
commendation; 
— 
and 
the 
very 
place 
itself, 
signalised 
by 
divine 
favours, 
moves 
themind 
more 
forcibly 
by 
itsmemories 
and 
associations, 
and 
strikes 
it 
with 
a 
kind 
of 
holy 
awe; 
as 
I 
remember 
even 
Protestants, 
who 
had 
had 
the 
happy 
privilegeofvisitingourLord’s 
sepulchre,tohave 
admitted. 


The 
same 
grace, 
nevertheless, 
will 
be 
obtained 
in 
any 
other 
place 
where 
the 
same 
lively 
faith 
and 
the 
same 
devotion 
of 
soul 
are 
found, 
even 
though 
the 
images, 
relics, 
and 
similar 
external 
helps 
be 
wanting; 
for 
such 
things 
have 
not 
their 
efficacy, 
so 
to 
speak, 
from 
the 
rite 
itself 
(ex 
opere 
operato), 
like 
the 
Sacraments, 
but 
from 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
subject 
(ex 
opere 
operantis), 
as 
the 
schoolmen 
say. 
And 
therefore, 
as 
the 
observance 
of 
certain 
times 
as 
peculiarly 
holy, 
is 
profitable 
solely 
because 
it 
excites 
to 
piety 
by 
a 
kind 
of 



special 
admonition, 
it 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
reverence 
of 
particular 
places, 
and 
the 
rites 
performed, 
or 
the 
objects 
preserved, 
therein. 
No 
person, 
therefore, 
who 
approves 
of 
the 
distinction 
of 
seasons 
and 
of 
the 
observances 
peculiar 
to 
them, 
is 
justified 
in 
condemning 
the 
distinction 
of 
places, 
and 
of 
the 
sacred 
objects 
preserved 
in 
them; 
nor 
is 
there 
any 
greater 
reason, 
therefore, 
for 
rejectingsacred 
pilgrimages,thanfestival-days. 


Besides, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
what 
evil 
there 
can 
be 
in 
bowing 
down 
before 
an 
image 
of 
the 
crucifix, 
and, 
while 
we 
look 
upon 
it, 
honouring 
Him 
it 
represents; 
whereas, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
its 
advantages 
are 
manifest, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
it 
has 
a 
wondrous 
effect 
in 
exciting 
the 
affections. 
We 
have 
already 
seen 
that 
such 
was 
the 
practice 
of 
Saint 
Gregory 
the 
Great; 
nor 
are 
the 
followers 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
entirely 
averse 
to 
it. 
And 
indeed, 
if 
it 
were 
not 
certain 
that 
there 
existed 
in 
former 
times 
grievous 
abuses 
of 
images, 
which 
have 
cast 
suspicion 
on 
a 
practice 
excellent 
in 
itself, 
and 
if 
we 
did 
not 
actually 
know 
what 
contests, 
both 
in 
ancient 
and 
modern 
times, 
have 
arisen 
concerning 
it, 
perhaps 
it 
would 
not 
be 
easy 
for 
any 
one 
to 
suspect 
any 
hidden 
evil 
or 
danger, 
or 
even 
any 
cause 
of 
scruple, 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
worshipping 
in 
presence 
of 
an 
image; 
— 
so 
innocent, 
nay 
so 
correctand 
laudabledoes 
thispracticeinitselfappear. 


It 
is 
commonly 
objected, 
indeed, 
that 
the 
pagans 
used 
the 
same 
qualification; 
professing 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
marble 
or 
wood, 
but 
the 
gods, 
that 
they 
worshipped. 
But 
in 
addition 
to 
their 
attributing 
a 
virtue 
to 
the 
images, 
and 
reposing 
confidence 
in 
them, 
we 
have 
already 
anticipated 
this 
objection 
by 
shewing, 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
image-worship 
is 
bad, 
and 
why 
it 
was 
prohibited 
of 
old, 
is 
not 
because 
of 
its 
own 
intrinsic 
evil, 
but 
because 
it 
inclined 
to 
the 
worship 
of 
false 
gods; 
for 
(from 
the 
received 
use 
of 
the 
word) 
that 
only 
is 
really 
idolatrous, 
which 
transfers 
to 
another 
the 
honour 
due 
to 
God. 
Now 
in 
the 
Church 
at 
the 
present 
day, 
all 
the 
honour 
paid 
to 
images 
is 



referred 
solely 
to 
those 
originals, 
through 
which 
we 
venerate 
that 
one 
and 
eternal 
Deity, 
to 
whom 
alone 
we 
have 
been 
taught 
to 
pay 
divine 
honours, 
and 
whose 
benefits 
we 
contemplate 
in 
others, 
in 
order 
that, 
admonished 
the 
more 
thereby,wemay 
terminateourworshipin 
Himself. 


I 
see 
one 
plausible 
objection; 
namely, 
that 
it 
is 
safer 
to 
abstain 
from 
a 
practice 
which 
is 
at 
all 
doubtful. 
Now 
to 
this 
I 
say, 
that 
if 
the 
doubt 
be 
trivial, 
the 
conscience 
which 
is 
thereby 
troubled 
is 
a 
scrupulous 
one. 
I 
admit, 
indeed, 
that 
in 
the 
present 
dispositions 
of 
many 
among 
Protestants, 
(to 
say 
nothing 
of 
Jews 
and 
Mahometans,) 
much 
offence 
arises 
from 
the 
use 
of 
images; 
but, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
must 
be 
considered 
what 
tumults 
and 
scandals, 
what 
rivers 
of 
blood, 
would 
be 
necessary, 
in 
order 
to 
eliminate 
from 
the 
Church 
this 
usage, 
which 
in 
itself, 
and 
apart 
from 
abuses 
and 
scandals 
on 
both 
sides, 
is 
a 
most 
excellent 
and 
praiseworthy 
one. 
Justly, 
therefore, 
has 
it 
been 
decreed 
that 
it 
should 
be 
retained. 
Nor 
can 
its 
retention 
afford 
to 
any 
one 
a 
just 
cause 
of 
separation. 
Nor 
is 
it 
to 
be 
believed 
that 
“the 
gates 
of 
hell” 
have 
so 
far 
“prevailed 
against 
the 
Church” 
and 
against 
the 
assistance 
which 
Christ 
promised 
to 
her, 
that, 
for 
so 
many 
ages, 
a 
damnable 
form 
of 
idolatry 
should 
havebeenestablishedovertheentire 
Christianworld. 


All 
things 
considered, 
therefore, 
seeing 
that 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
venerating 
images, 
as 
it 
is 
approved 
by 
the 
Fathers 
of 
Trent, 
there 
is 
nothing 
opposed 
to 
thedivinehonourthattheredoes 
not 
appeartobe, 
inthesetimes,whenallare 
sufficiently 
aware 
that 
the 
Omnipotent 
Deity 
alone 
is 
worshipped 
with 
divine 
honour, 
any 
fear 
of 
idolatry,which 
might 
pervertthe 
honour 
due 
to 
God;that, 
moreover, 
there 
exists 
in 
the 
Church 
a 
usage 
of 
so 
many 
centuries, 
which 
cannot 
be 
abolished 
without 
the 
greatest 
revolutions; 
that, 
in 
fine, 
if 
the 
abuses 
be 
removed, 
it 
is 
productive 
of 
signal 
advantage 
to 
piety; 
I 
conclude 
that 
the 
retention 
of 
the 
practice 
of 
venerating 
the 
original 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
image 
(in 
which 
alone 
image-worship 
consists) 
is 
a 
judicious 
and 
pious 



measure, 
provided 
it 
is 
confined 
strictly 
within 
its 
own 
limits, 
and 
the 
utmost 
caution 
is 
observed 
in 
its 
use. 
Care, 
however, 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
teach 
the 
people 
to 
think 
and 
speak 
correctly 
on 
a 
matter 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
divine 
honour; 
and 
to 
avoid 
every 
thing 
which 
may 
be 
productive 
of 
scandal, 
and 
may 
have 
the 
effect 
of 
alienating 
men’s 
minds 
more 
and 
more 
from 
the 
unityoftheChurch, 
orofdeterring 
those 
whoaredisposed 
toreturn. 


I 
will 
mention 
an 
instance 
which 
I 
myself 
remember. 
A 
soldier, 
who 
had 
deserted 
from 
the 
ranks, 
was 
condemned 
to 
be 
hanged; 
and 
when 
he 
was 
brought 
in 
sight 
of 
the 
gallows, 
and 
was 
in 
momentary 
expectation 
of 
the 
final 
sentence 
of 
pardon 
or 
of 
death 
from 
the 
Protestant 
prince 
in 
whose 
service 
he 
was, 
fluctuating 
as 
he 
was 
between 
fear 
and 
hope, 
he 
bathed 
with 
his 
tears 
a 
little 
silver 
image 
of 
the 
crucifix. 
But, 
on 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
happy 
news, 
he 
exulted 
with 
joy, 
and, 
printing 
kisses 
on 
the 
image, 
exclaimed, 
“’Tis 
to 
thee 
I 
owe 
my 
safety. 
’Tis 
thou 
that 
hast 
snatched 
me 
from 
the 
jaws 
of 
death. 
’Tis 
thou 
that 
hast 
delivered 
me!” 
So 
far, 
his 
language 
was 
correct. 
But 
when 
one 
of 
the 
bystanders, 
a 
man 
of 
rank, 
(and 
they 
were 
almost 
all 
Protestants,) 
added, 
as 
if 
calling 
his 
attention 
to 
what 
he 
had 
said, 
“Surely 
you 
do 
not 
mean 
this 
figure 
of 
Christ 
which 
you 
hold 
in 
your 
hand, 
but 
the 
Christ 
whosuffered 
for 
us?” 


“Yes,” 
said 
he, 
redoubling 
his 
kisses; 
“it 
was 
this 
one 
also;”— 
“Et 
cettuycy 
aussi” 
for 
he 
was 
a 
Frenchman. 
These 
words 
were 
heard 
with 
great 
horror 
by 
the 
bystanders; 
as 
if 
there 
were 
two 
Saviours, 
one 
the 
living 
Christ, 
the 
other 
the 
silver 
one; 
and 
one 
of 
them 
assured 
me 
that 
the 
hideousness 
of 
the 
papistic 
idolomania 
(for 
thus 
they 
speak 
in 
their 
unhappy 
misconception) 
had 
never 
appeared 
more 
clear 
to 
him. 
For 
my 
part, 
I 
think 
that 
this 
poor 
wretch, 
in 
his 
agitation 
of 
mind, 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
reflect 
on 
the 
words 
which 
he 
was 
using; 
and 
that 
the 
crime 
was 
in 
his 
language, 
rather 
than 
in 
his 
mind. 



Still, 
it 
is 
of 
great 
importance 
that 
these 
expressions 
should 
be 
carefully 
examined,in 
order 
thatthepeoplemaybedulyinstructed. 


And 
as 
there 
are 
Protestants 
who 
do 
not 
find 
in 
image-worship 
any 
just 
cause 
for 
severing 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
Church, 
so 
there 
are, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
learned 
Catholics 
who 
are 
of 
opinion, 
that 
if 
Protestants, 
and, 
in 
general, 
the 
nations 
which 
know 
not, 
or 
reject, 
this 
worship, 
should 
persist, 
through 
some 
inveterate 
repugnance, 
in 
declining 
to 
adopt 
it, 
they 
might, 
nevertheless, 
be 
received 
into 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
Church; 
provided 
they 
manifested 
good 
dispositions 
in 
every 
other 
respect, 
evinced 
a 
readiness 
to 
receive 
instruction, 
and 
admitted, 
meanwhile, 
that 
Catholics 
are 
not 
to 
be 
condemned 
on 
account 
of 
the 
practice. 
For 
in 
such 
things 
as 
these, 
which 
are 
neither 
necessary 
in 
themselves, 
nor 
expressly 
prescribed 
by 
Divine 
law, 
some 
allowance 
must 
be 
made 
for 
men’s 
inclination 
and 
for 
custom, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
scandal 
of 
weakbrethren. 


The 
question 
of 
Saints 
and 
of 
Relics 
is 
connected 
with 
that 
of 
images; 
and 
much 
of 
what 
we 
have 
said 
concerning 
images 
is 
equally 
applicable 
to 
this 
subject. 
And, 
as 
a 
general 
principle, 
we 
must 
hold, 
that 
neither 
the 
act 
of 
adoring 
in 
presence 
of 
an 
image, 
nor 
the 
worship 
of 
Saints 
or 
of 
relics, 
is 
approved, 
except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
referred 
to 
God; 
and 
that 
no 
act 
of 
religion 
is 
allowable, 
which 
may 
not 
be 
resolved 
into 
the 
honour 
of 
the 
one 
Almighty 
God, 
and 
does 
not 
terminate 
therein. 
When 
the 
Saints 
are 
honoured, 
therefore, 
the 
honour 
should 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
it 
is 
said 
in 
Scripture, 
“Thy 
friends 
are 
honoured, 
O 
God!” 
and 
“Praise 
ye 
the 
Lord 
in 
his 
Saints” 
And 
when 
the 
Saints 
are 
invoked, 
and 
their 
aid 
implored, 
their 
aid 
must 
always 
be 
understood 
to 
consist 
in 
the 
prayers 
which 
they 
pour 
forthwithgreatefficacyinourbehalf;as 
Bellarminehas 
observed,that 
“Help 



me, 
O 
Peter, 
or 
O 
Paul!” 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
signifying 
nothing 
more 
than 
“Pray 
for 
me!” 
or 
“Help 
meby 
intercedingforme!” 


It 
is 
certain, 
indeed, 
that 
Angel-guardians 
are 
assigned 
to 
us 
by 
God. 
Now 
theScripturecomparestheSaints 
toAngels, 
andcallsthem 
“equaltoAngels” 
(ισαγγελους). 


That 
the 
Saints 
have 
some 
concern 
in 
human 
affairs, 
appears 
to 
be 
conveyed 
by 
the 
“talking 
of 
Moses 
and 
Elias 
with 
Christ;” 
and 
that 
even 
particular 
events 
come 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Saints 
and 
Angels, 
(whether 
it 
be 
in 
the 
mirror 
of 
the 
Divine 
vision, 
or 
by 
the 
natural 
clearness 
and 
wide-
ranging 
powers 
of 
vision 
possessed 
by 
the 
glorified 
mind,) 
is 
insinuated 
in 
Christ’s 
declaration, 
that 
there 
is 
“joy 
in 
heaven 
upon 
one 
sinner 
that 
doth 
penance” 
Further, 
that 
God, 
in 
consideration 
of 
the 
Saints, 
even 
after 
their 
death, 
grants 
favours 
to 
men 
(although 
it 
is 
only 
through 
Christ 
that 
the 
Saints, 
whether 
of 
the 
Old 
or 
of 
the 
New 
Testament, 
possess 
their 
dignity), 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
prayers 
found 
in 
the 
Scripture: 
“Remember, 
O 
Lord, 
Abraham, 
Isaac, 
and 
Jacob, 
thy 
servants!”aformnotverydifferent 
fromthat 
which 
the 
Church 
commonly 
employs: 
“Grant, 
O 
Lord, 
that 
we 
may 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
merits 
and 
intercession 
of 
thy 
Saints!” 
that 
is, 
“Regard 
their 
labours, 
which, 
by 
thy 
gift, 
they 
have 
borne 
for 
thy 
name; 
hear 
their 
prayers, 
towhichthyonly-begottenSonhathgivenefficacy 
andvalue!” 


Some 
persons 
raise 
a 
question 
as 
to 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
Saints 
can 
have 
a 
knowledge 
of 
human 
affairs; 
and 
St. 
Augustine 
himself 
seems 
to 
have 
hesitated 
and 
entertained 
some 
doubt 
regarding 
it. 
But, 
for 
my 
part, 
I 
do 
not 
think 
it 
consistent 
with 
truth 
to 
suppose 
that 
these 
most 
holy 
souls 
are 
shut 
up 
in 
a 
place 
where, 
it 
is 
true, 
they 
are 
in 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
delights, 
but 
are 
ignorant 
of 
the 
events 
which 
are 
passing, 
or 
if 
they 
obtain 
some 
casual 
knowledge 
of 
them, 
obtain 
it 
solely 
through 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
angels. 
Because 
knowledge 
is 
the 
source 
of 
the 
highest 
pleasures 
of 
the 
mind; 
and 
as 



the 
souls 
of 
the 
Blessed 
contemplate 
m 
perfection, 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
suppose 
intimately 
to 
the 
secrets 
of 
Providenc 
admired 
from 
afar; 
and 
that 
they

government, 
which 
heretofore 
they 
but 
conceived 
without 
supposing 
them 
to 
b 
that 
pass 
among 
men. 
Many 
are 
inclined

PROPOSITION. 


The 
re-union 
of 
the 
Protestant 
and 
Roman 
Catholic 
Churches 
is 
not 
only 
possible, 
but 
further, 
is 
so 
recommended 
to 
each 
and 
every 
Christian 
by 
its 
advantages, 
both 
temporal 
and 
spiritual, 
that 
they 
are 
bound 
upon 
every 
fitting 
occasion, 
and 
in 
every 
suitable 
place 
and 
time, 
to 
contribute, 
each 
according 
to 
his 
ability, 
his 
own 
portion 
to 
the 
same, 
prescribed 
as 
it 
is 
by 
divine,naturallaw,and 
byexpressdecreeinthecouncilsoftheempire. 


EXPLANATION. 


I 
speak 
of 
such 
a 
re-union 
as 
may 
take 
place 
without 
violence 
to 
the 
conscience, 
or 
prejudice 
to 
the 
reputation, 
of 
either 
party, 
and 
so 
as 
to 
leave 
untouched 
the 
principles 
and 
hypotheses 
of 
both 
Churches. 
For 
since 
we 
are 



commanded 
in 
the 
Scriptures 
to 
love 
and 
cultivate 
peace 
and 
truth, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
such 
peace 
as 
may 
not 
be 
repugnant 
to 
the 
truth, 
far 
be 
it 
from 
us 
that, 
forthe 
sake 
ofobtaining 
peace 
andconcord 
in 
the 
Church, 
either 
partyshould 
determine 
or 
admit 
any 
thing 
in 
opposition 
to 
conscience, 
and 
thus 
call 
“light 
darkness, 
or 
darkness 
light;” 
but 
rather 
let 
each 
contend 
for 
truth 
in 
all 
things, 
and 
in 
every 
way 
reject 
whatever 
may 
be 
judged 
to 
border 
upon 
error. 
But 
this 
profession 
of 
truth 
or 
acknowledgment 
of 
error, 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be, 
must 
so 
be 
regulated 
that 
no 
scandal, 
much 
less 
contempt 
of 
religion, 
ensue 
for 
the 
infirm, 
and 
that 
the 
authority, 
reputation, 
and 
honour 
of 
the 
bishops 
and 
doctors 
of 
either 
Church 
shall 
suffer 
no 
prejudice 
therefrom; 
which 
would 
be 
the 
case 
if 
either 
party 
were 
obliged 
to 
recant 
its 
alleged 
errors, 
or, 
in 
the 
method 
of 
reconciliation, 
to 
admit 
any 
thing 
contrary 
to 
the 
received 
hypotheses 
of 
its 
Church. 
Indeed 
it 
is 
plain 
from 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
the 
case 
that 
nothing 
should 
be 
assumed 
as 
granted 
upon 
both 
sides 
which 
is 
denied 
by 
either, 
and 
that 
the 
domineering 
claim 
for 
retractation 
of 
errors 
is 
not 
even 
entitled 
to 
a 
thought; 
but 
that, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
parties 
should 
be 
exclusively 
devoted 
to 
a 
lucid 
exposition, 
a 
suitable 
declaration, 
or 
a 
temperate 
softening 
down 
of 
the 
controverted 
dogmas; 
and 
that, 
should 
all 
these 
fail, 
or 
should 
they 
be 
out 
of 
place 
in 
any 
particular 
controversy, 
they 
should 
abstain 
from 
recrimination 
and 
invective, 
and 
reserve 
the 
controverted 
matters 
for 
the 
judgment 
of 
a 
legitimate 
council. 
We 
may 
hence 
infer 
it 
to 
be 
not 
only 
expedient, 
but 
in 
its 
own 
way 
lawful, 
that 
such 
errors 
as 
do 
not 
directly 
go 
to 
subvert 
the 
foundations 
of 
faith, 
if 
they 
cannot 
be 
conveniently 
and 
quietly 
removed, 
should 
in 
the 
beginning 
be 
connived 
at, 
and 
mutually 
tolerated 
in 
weak 
brethren, 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
Christian 
charity. 
In 
this 
we 
are 
fortified 
by 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Apostles, 
who, 
notwithstanding 
that 
they 
knew 
it 
to 
be 
erroneous 
in 
the 
newly-converted 
Jews 
to 
insist, 
even 
under 
the 
New 
Law, 
upon 
abstinence 
from 
blood 
and 
things 
strangled, 



nevertheless, 
because 
they 
felt 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
the 
Jewish 
neophytes 
would 
not 
do 
rather 
than 
abandon 
the 
practice, 
not 
only 
wisely 
abstained 
from 
denouncing 
the 
error, 
but, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
introducing 
uniformity 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
by 
a 
law 
passed 
in 
the 
Council 
of 
Jerusalem, 
ordained 
that 
the 
Gentiles 
should 
observe 
the 
same 
rule 
as 
the 
Jews. 
Neither 
is 
it 
to 
be 
required 
from 
the 
parties, 
that, 
even 
although 
a 
preliminary 
re-union 
in 
the 
substantial 
articles 
should 
have 
taken 
place, 
either 
of 
them 
should 
at 
once 
subscribe 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
other 
in 
every 
particular. 
For 
perhaps 
it 
is 
not 
possible, 
nor 
is 
it 
even 
strictly 
necessary, 
that 
the 
general 
body, 
whether 
of 
our 
own 
brethren 
or 
of 
the 
Catholics, 
should 
be 
hurried 
from 
one 
extreme 
to 
the 
other 
suddenly 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
a 
moment, 
since 
Christ 
and 
the 
Apostles, 
as 
is 
manifest 
from 
the 
Gospel 
history 
and 
the 
Acts 
of 
the 
Apostles, 
delivered 
their 
doctrinesnotaltogetherand

POSTULATES. 


To 
the 
attaining 
the 
end, 
therefore, 
which 
we 
have 
in 
view, 
we 
need 
only 
premise 
six 
conditions, 
no 
one 
of 
which 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
the 
Roman 
Church 
may 
not, 
as 
a 
tender 
mother, 
graciously 
allow 
it 
to 
her 
ancient 
children. 


FIRSTPOSTULATE. 


The 
first 
is, 
“That 
the 
Supreme 
Pontiff 
should 
consent 
to 
hold 
as 
true 
members 
of 
the 
Christian 
Church, 
such 
Protestants 
as, 
under 
fair 
conditions, 
to 
be 
explained 
more 
at 
large 
below, 
are 
prepared 
to 
submit 
to 
the 
ecclesiastical 
hierarchy 
and 
to 
a 
legitimate 
Council, 
notwithstanding 
their 
persuasion 
that, 
henceforth 
and 
for 
ever, 
Communion 
must 
be 
celebrated 
underbothspeciesby 
theiradherents.” 



Inorderthatthe 
extremeandindispensablenecessity 
ofthisconditionmay 
be 
presented 
more 
clearly, 
and 
that 
Roman 
Catholics 
may 
see 
that 
the 
demand 
of 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds 
is 
not 
groundlessly 
put 
forward 
by 
Protestants, 
as 
well 
as 
that 
this 
demand 
is 
reconcilable 
with 
the 
possibility 
of 
union,wehaveto 
prove 
— 


First. 
By 
what 
an 
insuperable 
argument 
we 
are 
convinced 
that 
we 
cannot, 
withsafeconscience,communicate 
under 
onekind. 


Secondly. 
How, 
notwithstanding 
this 
opinion 
of 
Protestants, 
it 
is 
competent 
for 
the 
Supreme 
Pontiff, 
without 
disturbing 
any 
of 
the 
hypotheses 
of 
his 
own 
Church, 
to 
receive 
them 
into 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
Roman 
Church, 
and 
allowthemtoretaintheircustomof 
communicatingunderbothkinds. 


The 
first 
is 
thus 
proved. 
Whoever 
are 
convinced 
that 
the 
use 
of 
the 
cup 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
bread 
is 
enjoined 
by 
Christ, 
such 
persons, 
if 
they 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
communicate 
against 
their 
conscience, 
are 
unquestionably 
bound 
to 
communicate 
under 
both 
kinds. 
But 
Protestants 
are 
convinced 
that 
the 
use 
of 
the 
cup 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
bread 
was 
enjoined 
by 
Christ. 
Therefore 
Protestants, 
if 
they 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
communicate 
against 
their 
consciences, 
are 
bound 
to 
communicateunderboth 
kinds. 


Before 
we 
approach 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
minor, 
in 
order 
to 
put 
the 
question 
on 
a 
proper 
footing, 
we 
must 
premise 
that 
the 
word 
precept 
is 
understood 
in 
a 
twofoldsense: 


First, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
commands 
a 
thing 
“in 
itself 
and 
in 
its 
own 
substance,” 
by 
prescribing 
how 
the 
thing 
commanded, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
act 
which 
is 
the 
object 
of 
the 
law 
or 
precept, 
is 
to 
be 
done 
when 
it 
is 
reduced 
to 
action. 
The 
schoolmen 
say 
that 
such 
precepts 
regard 
the 
specification 
of 
the 
act. 
Under 
these 
may 
be 
classed, 
for 
instance, 
the 
law 
of 
marriage-contracts, 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
two 
persons 
are 
indissolubly 
united 
into 
one 
flesh. 
This 
law 
does 
not 
simply 
command 
matrimony, 
otherwise 
no 
one 
could 
live 
in 
celibacy 
without 



sin; 
but 
it 
commands 
matrimony 
“in 
itself 
and 
in 
its 
own 
substance” 
by 
prescribing 
how 
the 
man 
and 
woman 
are 
to 
be 
joined 
when 
they 
wish 
to 
enter 
into 
matrimony. 
To 
take 
a 
woman 
to 
wife, 
therefore, 
is 
matter 
of 
free 
will; 
nor 
does 
the 
law 
of 
matrimony 
oblige 
every 
man; 
but 
if 
a 
man 
wish 
to 
marry, 
it 
prescribes 
that 
he 
proceed 
in 
this 
way 
and 
in 
no 
other, 
namely, 
that 
he 
take 
one 
wife 
and 
no 
more, 
or, 
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Scripture, 
that 
“they 
he 
two 
in 
one 
flesh;” 
that, 
once 
married, 
he 
shall 
continue 
bound 
to 
his 
wife 
by 
an 
indissoluble 
tie, 
and 
shall 
remain 
“one 
flesh”with 
her; 
and 
therefore 
shall 
not 
be 
at 
liberty 
to 
repudiate 
her 
and 
to 
marry 
another, 
except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
adultery, 
&c. 
Such 
also 
is 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
civil 
law 
about 
the 
seven 
witnesses 
and 
the 
other 
solemnities 
required 
for 
the 
validity 
of 
a 
will 
— 
whereby 
no 
one 
is 
commanded 
to 
make 
a 
will, 
but 
the 
form 
is 
prescribed 
according 
to 
which 
a 
will 
must 
be 
framed 
in 
order 
to 
its 
being 
considered 
validandlawful. 


Secondly, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
commands 
that 
a 
certain 
act 
be 
done, 
or 
prohibits 
that 
it 
be 
done, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
has 
for 
its 
object, 
not 
the 
act 
itself, 
but 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
act, 
in 
which 
sense 
the 
schoolmen 
say 
that 
precepts 
regard 
not 
the 
specification 
oftheact,butits 
exercise. 


Suarez 
insists 
upon 
this 
distinction 
of 
precepts 
in 
the 
following 
words: 
“It 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
in 
some 
cases 
laws 
regard 
the 
performance 
of 
an 
action, 
and 
that 
such 
laws 
oblige 
to 
the 
particular 
act 
which 
they 
prescribe; 
such, 
for 
example, 
is 
the 
law 
of 
almsgiving: 
and 
that 
in 
other 
cases 
the 
law 
has 
reference 
only 
to 
the 
‘specification 
of 
the 
act,’ 
or 
the 
manner 
thereof, 
in 
which 
case, 
although 
the 
law 
does 
not 
oblige 
to 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
act, 
nevertheless 
it 
obliges 
that, 
if 
the 
act 
take 
place, 
such 
or 
such 
a 
method 
be 
observed; 
of 
this 
character, 
for 
instance, 
is 
the 
law 
of 
prayer, 
which, 
although 
it 
does 
not 
oblige 
us 
to 
pray 
at 
every 
time, 
obliges, 
nevertheless, 
that 
if 
we 



pray, 
the 
act 
of 
prayer 
shall 
be 
performed 
with 
attention” 
(De 
Legibus, 
b. 
i. 
c. 
1.) 


From 
which 
principles 
it 
is 
manifest, 
that 
when 
it 
is 
disputed 
between 
ourselves 
and 
the 
Romanists, 
whether 
communion 
under 
both 
kinds 
was 
commanded 
by 
Christ, 
the 
question 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
of 
the 
precept, 
not 
as 
it 
regards 
the 
exercise, 
butas 
itregards 
the 
specification 
oftheact. 


It 
is 
to 
be 
remarked, 
moreover, 
that 
as 
regards 
the 
specification 
of 
the 
act, 
two 
things 
are 
requisite 
for 
the 
precept: 
first, 
the 
determination 
or 
sanction 
of 
the 
thing 
itself 
considered 
in 
itself 
and 
in 
its 
substance. 
Thus, 
in 
the 
civil 
code, 
for 
the 
law 
which 
regards 
the 
framing 
of 
a 
valid 
and 
lawful 
will, 
it 
is 
requisite 
to 
determine 
the 
number 
of 
witnesses 
and 
the 
other 
solemnities 
which 
belongtothesubstanceofavalid 
will. 


Secondly. 
It 
is 
required 
that 
this 
determination 
emanate 
from 
the 
will 
of 
the 
superior, 
which 
obliges 
the 
agent, 
if 
he 
wish 
to 
reduce 
to 
action 
the 
thing 
regulated 
by 
law, 
and 
if 
be 
mean 
it 
to 
be 
valid, 
to 
do 
it 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
law 
made 
by 
his 
superior. 
Thus, 
when 
any 
one 
has 
a 
mind 
to 
make 
a 
will, 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
observe 
the 
determinate 
number 
of 
witnesses 
and 
the 
other 
prescribed 
solemnities, 
and 
if 
these 
be 
not 
observed, 
or 
be 
overlooked 
or 
neglected, 
the 
will 
is 
invalid. 
Another 
reason 
inducing 
this 
obligation 
is 
the 
will 
of 
the 
superior 
by 
whom 
the 
observance 
of 
these 
solemnities 
has 
been 
prescribed. 


Beyond 
these 
two 
things, 
none 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
have 
ever 
noticed 
any 
thingasrequisitetothepreceptwhich 
regards 
“thespecification 
ofanact.” 


So 
much 
being 
premised, 
Protestants, 
in 
proof 
of 
the 
minor 
proposition 
above 
mentioned, 
urge 
the 
imperative 
words 
of 
Christ: 
“Take 
ye 
and 
eat, 
this 
is 
my 
Body 
which 
is 
given 
for 
you; 
take 
ye 
and 
drink, 
this 
is 
my 
Blood 
which 
is 
shed 
for 
you.” 



Roman 
Catholics 
maintain 
the 
negative, 
and, 
against 
our 
proof 
of 
the 
minor 
proposition, 
allege 
that 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds 
was 
instituted, 
but 
was 
not 
commanded 
by 
Christ. 
And 
here 
we 
cannot 
deny 
that 
there 
is 
some 
difference 
between 
a 
precept 
regarding 
the 
exercise 
of 
an 
act, 
and 
institution. 
But 
the 
case 
is 
different 
with 
the 
precept 
regarding 
the 
specification 
of 
an 
act. 
It 
is 
for 
us, 
therefore, 
to 
prove 
that 
between 
the 
precept 
regarding 
the 
specification 
of 
an 
act 
— 
that, 
namely, 
which 
prescribes 
merely 
in 
what 
way 
the 
thing 
is 
to 
be 
done 
— 
and 
institution,there 
is 
nodifference. 
Whichis 
thusproved: 


Whatsoever 
has 
all 
the 
requisites 
of 
a 
precept 
considered 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
specification 
of 
an 
act, 
either 
is 
such 
a 
precept 
or 
is 
equivalent 
to 
such 
a 
precept. 
But 
institution 
has 
all 
the 
essential 
requisites 
of 
a 
precept 
considered 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
specification 
of 
an 
act. 
Therefore 
institution 
is 
either 
such 
a 
preceptorequivalenttoit. 


Themajorproposition 
isevidentfromtheterms. 


The 
minor 
is 
proved 
from 
the 
definition, 
and 
the 
requisites 
of 
the 
precept 
considered 
inrelationtothespecification 
ofanact. 


For 
according 
to 
the 
definition 
adduced 
above, 
such 
a 
precept 
prescribes 
the 
thing 
in 
itself 
and 
its 
own 
substance, 
by 
prescribing 
how 
the 
thing 
commanded 
should 
be 
done, 
if 
it 
be 
reduced 
to 
action. 
Now 
to 
every 
institutionthesameisrequired. 


Tosuchapreceptit

— 


1. 
That 
there 
be 
a 
determination 
or 
sanction 
of 
the

2. 
That

from 
the

of

the

if 
he

the

by

and

that 
it

to 
do 
it 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
law 
made 
by 
his 
superior. 
Nowthelike 
isrequired 
ineveryinstitution. 

This 
is 
plain 
from 
the 
induction 
of 
all 
the 
examples, 
insomuch 
that 
no 
other 
example 
exists 
or 
can 
exist 
in 
nature; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
such 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
every 
institution, 
that 
when 
the 
thing 
instituted 
is 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
action, 
that 
act 
must 
be 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
institution; 
or 
if 
it 
be 
not 
so, 
even 
should 
there 
be 
no 
other 
precept 
affecting 
the 
same 
thing, 
the 
act 
in 
question, 
by 
the 
very 
fact 
of 
its 
non-conformity 
to 
the 
institution, 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
faulty 
and 
culpable; 
which 
can 
be 
proved 
even 
by 
the 
example 
of 
Christ 
himself, 
who, 
in 
his 
reply 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
Pharisees, 
whether 
a 
man 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
repudiate 
his 
wife 
for 
any 
cause 
whatever, 
appeals 
to 
the 
institution 
of 
marriage, 
and 
proves 
that 
such 
a 
proceeding 
is 
nowise 
lawful, 
from 
the 
fact 
of 
God’s 
so 
instituting 
marriage 
that 
husband 
and 
wife 
shall 
be 
two 
in 
one 
flesh. 
And 
he 
thence 
infers, 
that 
the 
Jewish 
custom 
of 
repudiating 
wives 
at 
will 
was 
not 
only 
unlawful, 
but 
that 
a 
man 
committed 
adultery 
who 
repudiated 
his 
wife 
and 
married 
another, 
except 
in 
case 
of 
adultery. 
Now 
this 
argument 
of 
Christ 
would 
have 
been 
inconclusive, 
if 
institution 
had 
not 
the 
force 
of 
precept, 
considered 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
specification 
of 
the 
act, 
and 
did 
not 
entail 
an 
obligation 
of 
such 
nature, 
that, 
when 
the 
thing 
has 
once 
been 
instituted, 
whosoever, 
for 
instance, 
wishes 
to 
enter 
into 
matrimony, 
must 
do 
so 
conformably 
to 
thenatureof 
its 
institution; 
and,once 
married,must 
be 
and 
continue 
“one 
flesh” 
with 
his 
wife 
in 
a 
bond 
indissoluble 
unless 
by 
death 
or 
adultery. 


Thus, 
also, 
if 
any 
one 
wishes 
to 
take 
on 
himself 
the 
office 
of 
pastor 
and 
to 
teach 
the 
word 
of 
God 
in 
the 
Church, 
and 
undertake 
the 
administration 
of 
sacraments, 
he 
is 
bound 
to 
accept 
and 
discharge 
that 
office 
agreeably 
to 
the 
institution 
of 
our 
Saviour. 
Whoever, 
in 
like 
manner, 
wishes 
to 
undertake 
and 
perform 
the 
office 
of 
a 
magistrate, 
must 
do 
so 
conformably 
to 
its 
institution: 
and 
the 
same 
holds 
in 
every 
institution 
whatsoever; 
so 
that 
no 
example 
to 
the 
contrary 
hasever 
beenalleged,nor,fromthenature 
ofthings,can 
anyexist. 



It 
follows, 
therefore, 
that 
every 
institution 
imports, 
or 
is 
in 
fact 
of 
equal 
effect 
with, 
or 
equivalent 
to, 
a 
precept 
of 
the 
specification 
of 
the 
act 
by 
which 
the 
thing 
instituted 
is 
reduced 
to 
action 
or 
to 
use. 
And 
such 
is 
the 
force 
of 
this 
truth, 
that 
it 
has 
won 
the 
assent 
of 
the 
learned 
Jesuit, 
Francis 
Suarez, 
who 
elaborately 
proves 
that 
“every 
institution 
of 
Christ 
has 
the 
force, 
not 
merely 
of 
an 
affirmative 
precept, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
any 
one 
wishing 
to 
do 
the 
thing 
instituted 
must 
do 
it 
conformably 
to 
the 
institution, 
but 
furthermore 
of 
a 
negative 
precept; 
so 
that, 
if 
the 
thing 
cannot 
be 
done 
as 
it 
is 
prescribed, 
it 
had 
better 
be 
omitted 
than 
done 
in 
any 
other 
way.” 
(Tert. 
Pars 
S. 
Thom. 
Disp. 


xliii. 
§iv. 
Conclus,iv.) 
Whence 
we 
argueas 
followsfor 
Communionunder 
bothkinds: 
— 
To 
whomsoever 
it 
is 
commanded 
by 
Christ 
that 
they 
partake 
of 
the 
sacrament 
of 
his 
Supper 
according 
to 
his 
institution, 
to 
the 
same 
is 
it 
commanded 
that 
they 
communicate 
under 
both 
kinds. 
But 
a 
precept 
is 
given 
to 
each 
and 
all 
Christians 
that 
they 
partake 
of 
the 
sacrament 
of 
his 
Supper 
according 
to 
his 
institution. 
Therefore 
command 
is 
given 
to 
each 
and 
all 
Christiansthattheycommunicateunderbothkinds. 


Having 
now 
proved 
the 
necessity 
of 
this 
postulate, 
it 
remains 
to 
be 
proved, 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
that 
it 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
possibility 
of 
union, 
and 
that 
in 
demanding 
it, 
nothing 
is 
required 
of 
the 
Apostolic 
See 
which 
it 
is 
beyond 
its 
authority 
and 
power 
to 
concede; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
Supreme 
Pontiff 
can, 
without 
derogating 
from 
the 
principles 
and 
hypotheses 
of 
his 
Church, 
allow 
Protestantstoretain 
their 
customofcommunicating 
under 
bothkinds. 


Now 
it 
is 
admitted 
on 
both 
sides, 
that 
the 
Pope 
can, 
out 
of 
the 
authority 
reserved 
to 
him 
by 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent, 
grant 
to 
whomsoever 
he 
thinks 
fit 
the 
perpetual 
and 
irrevocable 
use 
of 
the 
cup, 
provided 
only 
this 
dispensation 
tends 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
Christian 
religion. 
And 
the 
thing, 
in 
point 
of 
fact, 
has 
been 
already 
granted 
by 
the 
Roman 
Pontiff, 
when, 
without 
much 



difficulty, 
he 
allowed 
the 
use 
of 
the 
cup 
to 
the 
Bohemians, 
who 
were 
in 
rebellionupon 
thissubject. 


SECONDPOSTULATE. 


The 
second 
condition 
is, 
that 
the 
Pontiff 
should 
be 
satisfied 
not 
to 
force 
upon 
ProtestantChurches 
what 
are 
called 
private 
Masses, 
or 
those 
Masses 
in 
which 
the 
priest 
alone 
communicates. 
This 
condition 
is 
sought, 
not 
because 
Protestants 
conceive 
such 
a 
mode 
of 
communicating 
to 
be 
simply 
unlawful, 
since, 
even 
in 
their 
own 
churches, 
their 
pastors 
sometimes, 
in 
cases 
of 
necessity, 
themselves 
receive 
the 
Lord’s 
Supper 
without 
any 
one 
else 
being 
present; 
nor 
because, 
after 
the 
preliminary 
union, 
they 
would 
forbid 
their 
brethren 
to 
assist 
at 
the 
private 
Masses 
of 
the 
Catholics; 
but 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
— 


1. 
Because 
they 
are 
convinced 
that 
the 
Eucharist 
should 
ordinarily, 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
(always 
excepting 
cases 
of 
necessity), 
be 
celebrated 
after 
the 
form 
which 
Christ 
has 
instituted, 
and 
which 
is 
described 
in 
the 
Gospel; 
namely, 
that, 
besides 
the 
priest, 
there 
be 
present 
others 
to 
whom 
the 
Body 
and 
Blood 
ofChristcan 
bedistributed 
withthe 
blessedbread 
andwine. 
2. 
Because 
it 
is 
notorious 
that 
great 
abuses 
were 
introduced 
into 
the 
Church 
by 
means 
of 
those 
private 
Masses, 
of 
which 
abuses, 
about 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Reformation, 
not 
only 
the 
Protestants 
of 
Germany, 
but 
many 
of 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
also 
complained, 
in 
the 
Centum 
Gravamina; 
and 
that 
bynomeansasamatterof 
form. 
3. 
Because 
in 
most 
Protestant 
churches 
there 
remains 
not 
a 
vestige 
of 
the 
numberless 
altars 
intended 
for 
such 
private 
use; 
much 
less 
have 
the 
foundations 
or 
trusts 
devoted 
by 
the 
pious 
faithful 
of 
Christ 
to 
such 
purposes 
been 
able 
to 
escape 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
harpies: 
all 
those 
properties 
being 
at 

present 
either 
wasted 
or 
applied 
to 
other 
purposes, 
in 
part 
sacred, 
in 
part 
profane. 


THIRDPOSTULATE. 


That 
the 
Pope 
should 
consentto 
leave 
unproscribed 
and 
free 
from 
all 
censure, 
to 
the 
aforementioned 
Churches, 
their 
doctrines 
touching 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
sinner 
before 
God; 
viz. 
that 
the 
adult 
who 
wishes 
to 
become 
a 
partaker 
of 
Divine 
Grace, 
and 
to 
obtain 
remission 
of 
sin, 
and 
eternal 
salvation, 
should 
acknowledge 
his 
sins, 
repent 
sincerely 
of 
them, 
and 
rely, 
not 
upon 
any 
merits 
of 
his 
own, 
but 
solely 
upon 
the 
death 
and 
merits 
of 
Christ, 
with 
a 
hope 
and 
confidence 
of 
obtaining 
the 
forgiveness 
of 
his 
sins 
and 
life 
everlasting; 
and 
should 
thenceforth 
abstain 
from 
sin 
and 
devote 
himself 
to 
holiness, 
that 
is 
to 
say,to 
goodworks, 
“without 
which 
no 
man 
shall 
see 
God.” 


There 
appears 
to 
be 
no 
reason 
why 
the 
Roman 
Pontiff 
should 
not 
leave 
this 
doctrine 
free 
to 
members 
of 
our 
profession; 
especially 
since, 
after 
half 
a 
century 
of 
contest, 
the 
more 
acute 
on 
both 
sides 
have 
discovered 
that 
hitherto 
the 
dispute 
has 
been 
like 
the 
olden 
contests 
of 
the 
Andabatæ; 
[Gladiators 
who 
fought 
with 
their 
eyes 
shut.] 
that 
between 
both 
opinions 
there 
is 
no 
real 
difference, 
but 
that 
the 
contest 
is 
purely 
one 
of 
words; 
and 
that 
the 
controversy, 
like 
a 
saw, 
has 
been 
drawn 
hither 
and 
thither, 
the 
quarrel 
regarding 
not 
the 
matter 
itself, 
but 
the 
various 
acceptations 
of 
the 
terms 
employed. 
It 
is 
true 
the 
Catholics 
usually 
place 
the 
formal 
notion 
of 
justification 
in 
the 
infusion 
of 
sanctifying 
grace, 
whereas 
the 
Protestants 
maintain 
that 
the 
word 
‘justification’ 
should 
be 
understood 
in 
a 
forensic 
sense, 
and 
as 
signifying 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
non-imputation 
of 
sin 
in 
consideration 
of 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ. 
The 
storms 
which 
this 
difference 
of 
opinion 
has 
excited 
in 
the 
Church 
are 
too 
well 
known 
to 
require 
mention; 
but 
Calixtus 
and 
Horneius, 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Helmstadt 
theologians, 
and 



subsequently, 
the 
brothers 
Adrian 
and 
Peter 
von 
Walenburch, 
the 
Fratres 
Wallenburgenses, 
as 
they 
are 
called, 
and 
more 
lately 
the 
Capuchin 
Denis 
of 
Werle, 
in 
his 
Via 
Pacis, 
published 
some 
five 
years 
ago 
with 
the 
consent 
and 
approbation 
of 
his 
superiors, 
have 
all 
observed 
that 
this 
controversy 
could 
be 
broughttoan 
endby 
afavourableexplanationoftheterms. 


For, 
if 
the 
term 
justification 
be 
understood 
in 
so 
wide 
a 
sense 
as 
to 
embrace 
the 
idea 
of 
sanctification 
or 
renovation, 
and 
the 
denomination 
be 
thus 
borrowed 
from 
the 
more 
noble 
act 
of 
renovation, 
they 
hold 
that 
the 
notion 
of 
justification 
in 
this 
extended 
sense 
may 
properly 
be 
placed 
in 
the 
infusionofsanctifying 
grace;butthat, 
if 
justification 
be 
strictly 
interpreted 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
justification 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
distinguished 
in 
its 
formal 
essence 
from 
the 
act 
of 
renovation 
(with 
which 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
simultaneous) 
— 
under 
such 
circumstances 
it 
does 
not 
consist 
in 
the 
aforesaidinfusion,butin 
thesolenonimputationofsin. 


FOURTHPOSTULATE. 


The 
fourth 
condition 
is, 
that 
the 
Pope 
be 
pleased 
to 
permit 
to 
the 
Protestant 
pastors 
the 
right 
of 
marriage, 
and 
even 
of 
a 
second 
marriage 
upon 
the 
death 
of 
their 
wives, 
until 
a 
council 
shall 
have 
decided 
upon 
the 
latter 
case. 
In 
which 
instance, 
again, 
nothing 
is 
asked 
of 
the 
Sovereign 
Pontiff 
which 
it 
is 
not 
in 
his 
power 
to 
grant. 
For, 
according 
to 
the 
common 
opinion, 
the 
celibacy 
of 
the 
clergy 
is 
not 
enjoined 
by 
positive 
Divine 
law, 
but 
by 
human, 
and 
is 
therefore, 
so 
tospeak, 
liable 
to 
abrogation 
at 
thehands 
ofthose 
who 
made 
the 
law. 
We 
have 
in 
addition 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Florence, 
by 
which 
permission 
tomarry 
isgivenamongtheunitedGreeksevento 
priests. 


FIFTHPOSTULATE. 



The 
fifth 
is, 
that 
the 
Pope 
be 
pleased 
to 
confirm 
and 
hold 
for 
valid 
the 
ordinations 
hitherto 
performed 
by 
Protestants; 
and 
to 
do 
this 
in 
a 
way 
which 
will 
be 
acceptable 
on 
both 
sides, 
will 
not 
prejudice 
either 
party, 
and 
will 
be 
calculated 
to 
set 
the 
faithful 
at 
rest, 
as 
far 
as 
can 
be 
done, 
touching 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
sacraments. 
For 
as 
to 
the 
future 
ordinations, 
which 
after 
the 
preliminary 
union 
must 
be 
performed 
according 
to 
the 
Roman 
rite, 
there 
shall 
be 
no 
question. 
And 
here 
we 
would 
have 
it 
distinctly 
understood 
that 
we 
are 
anxious 
about 
the 
sanction 
of 
these 
ordinations, 
not 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
our 
own 
brethren, 
none 
of 
whom 
entertain 
a 
doubt 
upon 
the 
subject, 
but 
solely 
on 
account 
of 
the 
Roman 
Catholics, 
who, 
without 
such 
confirmation, 
would 
call 
into 
doubt 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
sacraments 
received 
at 
our 
hands 
after 
the 
preliminary 
union. 
Whence 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
decision 
of 
this 
article 
could 
notbepostponedto 
themeetingof 
thefutureCouncil. 


SIXTH 
POSTULATE. 


The 
sixth 
is, 
that 
the 
Sovereign 
Pontiff 
shall 
so 
deal 
with 
the 
Protestant 
Electors, 
Princes, 
Counts, 
and 
other 
States 
of 
the 
Roman 
Empire, 
agreeably 
to 
the 
right 
and 
authority 
which 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
Treaty 
of 
Passau 
and 
the 
Peace 
of 
Westphalia 
they 
have, 
or 
claim 
to 
have, 
over 
the 
clergy 
and 
the 
affairs 
of 
religion, 
that 
the 
said 
temporal 
lords 
may 
not 
oppose 
themselves 
to 
these 
religious 
efforts 
for 
union, 
but 
may 
rather 
be 
gently 
induced 
to 
promote 
a 
design 
so 
salutary. 
And 
that 
the 
Sovereign 
Pontiff 
can 
effect 
such, 
and 
even 
greater 
things, 
is 
sufficiently 
apparent 
from 
the 
concordats 
between 
the 
Roman 
and 
the 
French 
Churches, 
and 
from 
the 
principles 
now 
maintained 
by 
the 
doctors 
of 
the 
Sorbonne, 
and 
amongst 
them 
by 
M. 
Lewis 
Elias 
Dupin, 
in 
his 
historical 
Dissertations 
upon 
the 
Ancient

in 
Christ, 
notwithstanding 
their 
adherence 
to 
Communion 
under 
one 
kind 
and 
other 
hithertocontroverted 
articles, 
untilthedecisionofa 
legitimate 
council. 
3. 
That 
the 
priests 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
their 
bishops, 
and 
the 
bishops 
to 
their 
archbishops, 
and 
so 
on, 
according 
to 
the 
established 
hierarchy 
of 
the 
Catholic 
Church. 
Now 
that 
Catholics, 
though 
communicating 
under 
one 
kind, 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
brethren 
by 
Protestants 
who 
hold 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds 
tobe 
enjoinedbyChrist,isshewnby 
twoarguments. 


1. 
Because 
the 
error 
of 
Roman 
Catholics 
concerning 
this 
article 
is 
supposed 
to 
be, 
up 
to 
the 
present, 
involuntary 
and 
invincible. 
Now 
such 
an 
error, 
when 
it 
concerns 
a 
non-fundamental 
article 
of 
faith, 
can 
nowise 
be 
considered 
damnable:as 
isthus 
proved. 
When 
involuntary 
deprivation 
of 
the 
whole 
does 
not 
entail 
damnation, 
neither 
does 
an 
involuntary 
and 
invincible 
error 
about 
a 
part. 
But 
the 
involuntary 
deprivation 
of 
the 
Sacrament 
of 
the 
Eucharist 
does 
not 
entail 
damnation; 
therefore 
neither 
does 
an 
involuntary 
and 
hitherto 
invincible 
error 
about 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Sacrament 
of 
the 
Eucharist 
cause 
damnation. 
Now, 
an 



error 
which 
is 
not 
damnable 
cannot 
have 
for 
object 
a 
fundamental 
article 
of 
faith. 
But,&c. 
Therefore,&c. 


2. 
Because, 
in 
every 
case 
where 
two 
divine 
precepts 
clash, 
so 
that 
the 
one 
cannot 
be 
observed 
without 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
other, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
if 
that 
one 
be 
observed 
which 
is 
more 
excellent 
in 
itself, 
and 
whose 
observance 
is 
more 
necessary. 
The 
celebration 
of 
the 
Sabbath, 
for 
instance, 
which, 
under 
the 
New 
Testament, 
has 
given 
way 
to 
the 
Sunday, 
is 
prescribed 
in 
the 
decalogue, 
and 
its 
violation 
prohibited. 
Now 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
works 
of 
charity 
towards 
one’s 
neighbour 
are 
prescribed 
not 
only 
by 
the 
divine, 
but 
also 
by 
the 
natural 
law. 
Supposing, 
therefore, 
that 
my 
neighbour 
is 
in 
some 
extreme 
calamity, 
and 
that 
he 
must 
be 
freed 
by 
me 
upon 
the 
Lord’s 
day, 
and 
that, 
by 
the 
consequent 
journey 
and 
neglect 
of 
religious 
duties, 
the 
Sabbath 
must 
be 
violated, 
— 
I 
say 
that, 
in 
such 
a 
case, 
the 
violation 
of 
this 
first 
precept 
is 
not 
sinful, 
because 
charity 
to 
one’s 
neighbour 
is 
the 
more 
excellent 
work, 
and 
the 
law 
enjoining 
it 
the 
more 
necessary. 
To 
apply 
this 
to 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
It 
is 
supposed, 
according 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
Protestants, 
that 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds 
is 
commanded 
by 
Christ; 
but, 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
both 
sides, 
unity 
of 
faith 
and 
concord 
in 
the 
Church 
are 
commanded, 
and 
schism 
is 
forbidden 
as 
the 
most 
grievous 
evil 
against 
Christian 
charity. 
The 
Pope, 
therefore, 
according 
to 
the 
supposition 
that 
Communion, 
under 
one 
kind, 
or 
under 
both, 
is 
left 
to 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Church, 
can 
indulge 
Protestants 
with 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds; 
he 
can 
also 
extend 
to 
Catholics 
inhabiting 
the 
samecountry 
with 
us 
theprivilegeof 
communicating 
under 
both 
kinds: 
and 
thus 
the 
actual 
union 
of 
the 
churches 
might 
be 
commenced. 
But, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
in 
Spain, 
Portugal, 
and 
Italy, 
for 
instance, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
exceeding 
difficulties 
and 
the 
disturbance 
of 
the 
whole 
religion 
of 
Christ 
which 
it 
would 
occasion, 
the 
Pope 
cannot 
introduce 
Communionunderbothkinds. 

It 
is 
asked, 
therefore, 
what 
are 
Protestants 
to 
do 
in 
this 
matter? 
Are 
they 
so 
to 
act 
that 
schism 
is 
to 
be 
caused, 
or 
to 
be 
perpetuated? 
or 
are 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
brethren 
in 
Christ, 
although 
they 
deny 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds 
to 
be 
commanded 
by 
him, 
and 
although 
the 
Roman 
Pontiff 
be 
unable 
to 
introduce 
it 
into 
all 
the 
provinces 
of 
Christendom? 
I 
say 
they 
must 
take 
the 
latter 
alternative; 
because 
the 
preservation 
of 
unity 
in 
the 
Church 
and 
the 
removal 
of 
schism 
is 
enjoined 
by 
Christ: 
and 
this 
it 
has, 
even 
in 
our 
opinion, 
in 
common 
with 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds. 
Now 
it 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
the 
precept 
of 
maintaining 
unity 
is 
the 
more 
excellent 
of 
the 
two, 
and 
that, 
if 
both 
cannot 
be 
observed 
together,themorenecessary 
oneshouldbefollowed,and 
toleration 
shouldbe 
extended 
to 
the 
error 
regarding 
the 
other. 
Now 
the 
paramount 
necessity 
pf 
observing 
Christian 
charity, 
to 
which 
schism 
is 
diametrically 
opposed, 
is 
clearlytaught 
bySt. 
Paul(1Cor. 
xiii.) 
throughoutalmostanentire 
chapter. 


ONTHECOURSETOBEPURSUED. 


A 
secret 
and 
honourable 
understanding 
being 
come 
to 
on 
both 
sides, 
the 
Electors, 
Dukes, 
Princes, 
and 
other 
States 
of 
the 
Germanic 
Empire, 
Romanists 
as 
well 
as 
Protestants, 
shall 
be 
invited 
by 
the 
Roman 
Emperor 
each 
to 
send 
to 
the 
Congress 
one 
or 
two 
doctors 
equally 
respectable 
for 
learning 
and 
moderation, 
to 
confer 
upon 
the 
union 
of 
the 
churches. 
And 
in 
this 
matter 
it 
is 
self-evident 
that 
no 
deputy 
should 
be 
sent 
by 
the 
temporal 
lords 
to 
this 
congress, 
unless 
such 
as 
shall 
have 
been 
privately 
agreed 
upon 
this 
method 
of 
acting, 
or 
shall 
be 
of 
like 
sentiments 
with 
those 
who 
are 
so 
agreed. 


In 
this 
congress, 
or 
conference, 
setting 
aside 
the 
aforesaid 
preliminary 
postulates 
and 
private 
stipulations, 
they 
shall 
proceed 
to 
examine 
the 
questions, 
concerning 
which 
the 
opposite 
parties 
are 
not 
clearly 
or 
fully 



agreed. 
These, 
it 
will 
appear, 
are 
by 
no 
means 
of 
one 
kind, 
much 
less 
are 
they 
all 
of 
equal 
importance. 
They 
may, 
however, 
be 
conveniently 
distributed 
into 
threeclasses. 


FIRSTCLASS. 


To 
the 
first 
class 
shall 
belong 
those 
controversies 
which 
regard 
equivocal 
expressions 
or 
diversely 
received 
terms 
— 
as 
for 
instance, 
Whether 
the 
Sacrament 
of 
the 
Altar, 
or 
the 
Eucharist, 
he 
a 
Sacrifice? 
In 
deciding 
which, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
there 
exists 
no 
dispute 
between 
us 
and 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
Eucharist 
can 
be 
called 
a 
sacrifice, 
which 
is 
admitted 
on 
both 
sides; 
but 
whether 
it 
he 
a 
sacrifice, 
properly 
or 
improperly 
so 
called. 
Now 
this, 
as 
is 
plain 
from 
the 
terms, 
is 
a 
controversy 
about 
the 
mode 
of 
speaking; 
since 
each 
party 
takes 
its 
peculiar 
definition 
of 
sacrifice 
for 
the 
foundation 
of 
its 
own 
opinion. 
By 
the 
Protestants, 
and 
even 
by 
Cardinal 
Bellarmine, 
the 
term 
‘sacrifice,’ 
conformably 
to 
the 
phraseology 
of 
the 
Old 
Testament, 
from 
which 
the 
doctrine 
of 
sacrifices 
is 
to 
be 
drawn, 
is 
properly 
applied 
to 
a 
living 
thing 
when, 
by 
God’s 
precept, 
the 
animal 
or 
animated 
substance 
is 
destroyed 
by 
slaying 
in 
honour 
of 
God. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
Roman 
Church 
denies 
the 
Eucharist 
to 
be 
strictly 
a 
sacrifice; 
holding, 
in 
common 
with 
us, 
very 
properly, 
that 
the 
sacrifice 
in 
question 
is 
completed 
without 
a 
new 
shedding 
of 
blood 
and 
a 
new 
slaying 
of 
the 
victim, 
— 
in 
one 
word, 
and 
that 
an 
ecclesiastical 
one, 
that 
it 
is 
an 
unbloody 
sacrifice. 
So 
far 
is 
she 
from 
affirming 
that 
the 
Eucharist 
is 
a 
sacrifice 
in 
the 
proper 
and 
rigorous 
sense, 
according 
to 
our 
definition 
and 
that 
of 
Bellarmine. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
when 
the 
Romans 
style 
the 
Eucharist 
a 
sacrifice 
properly 
so 
called, 
they 
adopt 
that 
expression 
either 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
sacrifices 
still 
more 
improperly 
so 
termed, 
as, 
for 
instance, 
sacrifices 
of 
the 
lips, 
of 
the 
heart, 
“sacrifices 
of 
jubilation,” 
&c.; 
or 
else 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
matter 
of 
a 



sacrifice 
properly 
so 
called; 
for, 
in 
the 
Eucharist, 
numerically 
the 
same 
sacrifice 
which 
was 
delivered 
up 
for 
us, 
and 
numerically 
the 
same 
blood 
which 
was 
shed 
for 
us, 
are 
really, 
nay 
most 
really, 
present, 
and 
are 
given 
and 
drunk 
by 
the 
communicants; 
not 
in 
faith 
merely, 
but 
by 
the 
mouth 
of 
the 
body, 
though 
not 
in 
a 
carnal 
or 
Capharnaïtic 
way, 
but 
still 
truly; 
and 
thus 
under 
this 
title 
also 
the 
Eucharist 
merits 
the 
name 
of 
a 
sacrifice 
properly 
so 
called. 
Now, 
according 
to 
this 
definition 
of 
the 
Romanists, 
Protestants 
might 
allow 
the 
Eucharist 
to 
be 
a 
sacrifice 
properly 
so 
called. 
From 
which 
it 
is 
plainer 
than 
the 
noon-day 
that 
the 
debate 
does 
not 
regard 
the 
matter 
itself, 
but 
merely 
the 
words; 
and 
that 
both 
parties 
are 
agreed 
in 
this 
— 
namely, 
that 
Christ 
is 
not 
slain 
anew 
in 
the 
Eucharist, 
but 
that 
He 
is 
present 
therein 
notwithstanding, 
andthathis 
Bodyistruly 
eaten; 
that 
thus 
there 
is 
instituteda 
commemoration 
or 
representation 
of 
the 
sacrifice 
which 
was 
once 
offered 
for 
us 
on 
the 
Cross, 
but 
which 
cannot 
be 
again 
offered 
in 
the 
same 
manner; 
and 
that,according 
tothedifferentacceptationsoftheword, 
itmay 
besaidtobea 
“sacrifice 
properly 
so 
called,” 
or 
a 
“sacrifice 
improperly 
so 
called.” 
Matthew 
Galen, 
a 
Catholic 
writer, 
in 
his 
13th 
Catechesis 
(page 
422, 
Lyons 
edition), 
well 
observes: 
“We 
can 
thus 
admit 
that 
our 
sacrifice 
is 
not 
a 
sacrifice 
properly 
and 
rigorously 
so 
called,but 
is 
notwithstanding 
perfectly 
entitled 
to 
the 
name 
of 
sacrifice, 
as 
being 
an 
imitation 
or 
representation 
of 
that 
first 
sacrifice 
which 
Jesus 
Christ 
offered 
to 
his 
Father.” 
I 
shall 
add, 
ex 
abundantly 
a 
further 
motive, 
but 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
sentiments 
of 
others, 
and 
alwaysdeferringtothe 
decisionsofthemorelearned,thattheholyFathers, 
in 
various 
places, 
and 
amongst 
them 
Cyril 
of 
Jerusalem 
and 
St. 
Cyprian, 
have 
not 
hesitated 
to 
call 
the 
Eucharist, 
the 
one, 
a 
most 
true 
and 
singular 
sacrifice, 
theother, 
a 
sacrifice 
full 
of 
God, 
to 
be 
revered, 
tremendous, 
and 
most 
sacred, 
It 
might, 
perhaps, 
further 
be 
granted, 
that 
the 
Eucharist 
is 
not 
only 
a 
sacrifice 
commemorative 
of 
that 
bloody 
sacrifice 
in 
which 
Christ 
once 
offered 
Himself 



for 
us 
upon 
the 
cross 
to 
God 
the 
Father, 
and 
in 
this 
sense, 
according 
to 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
Protestants, 
a 
sacrifice 
“improperly 
so 
called 
but 
that 
it 
is 
moreover 
a 
certain 
incomprehensible 
offering 
of 
the 
Body 
of 
Christ 
once 
delivered 
for 
us 
to 
death: 
and, 
in 
this 
sense, 
a 
true 
sacrifice, 
or 
if 
you 
wish 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
“sacrifice 
properly 
so 
called.” 
St. 
Gregory 
of 
Nyssa 
says 
expressly, 
in 
his 
first 
Sermon 
upon 
the 
Resurrection 
of 
Christ: 
“By 
a 
mysterious 
kind 
of 
sacrifice, 
which 
cannot 
be 
discerned 
by 
man, 
He 
offers 
himself 
a 
host 
for 
us 
and 
immolates 
the 
victim, 
being 
at 
once, 
in 
his 
own 
person, 
the 
Priest 
and 
that 
Lamb 
of 
God 
who 
taketh 
away 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
world. 
But 
when 
did 
He 
perform 
this? 
When 
He 
gave 
his 
Body 
to 
be 
eaten 
and 
his 
Blood 
to 
be 
drunk 
by 
the 
assembled 
disciples, 
then 
He 
openly 
declared 
that 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
Lamb 
was 
accomplished; 
for 
the 
body 
of 
the 
victim 
is 
not 
yet 
to 
be 
eaten 
if 
it 
have 
life 
in 
it. 
Wherefore, 
when 
He 
gave 
his 
Body 
to 
be 
eaten 
and 
his 
Blood 
to 
be 
drunk 
by 
his 
disciples, 
the 
body 
was 
immolated 
in 
a 
secret 
and 
invisible 
way, 
as 
it 
pleased 
the 
power 
of 
Him 
who 
was 
accomplishing 
sacrifices 
upon 
the 
mystery 
of 
himself.” 
St. 
Jerome 
says: 
“The 
oblation 
of 
the 
Church, 
which 
the 
Lord 
taught 
should 
be 
offered 
over 
the 
universal 
world, 
has 
been 
reputed 
a 
pure 
sacrifice 
by 
God, 
and 
is 
acceptable 
to 
Him. 
There 
are 
offerings 
in 
the 
Old 
Covenant, 
and 
offerings 
in 
the 
New, 
— 
sacrifices 
amongst 
the 
people 
— 
sacrifices 
in 
the 
church; 
but 
the 
kind 
only 
is 
changed, 
since 
it 
is 
offered 
now, 
not 
by 
slaves 
but 
by 
free 
men.” 
St. 
Augustine: 
“Instead 
of 
all 
the 
sacrifices 
and 
oblations,” 
(meaning 
of 
the 
Old 
Testament,) 
“now, 
in 
the 
New 
Testament, 
his 
Body 
is 
offered 
and 
administered 
to 
those 
partaking 
of 
it.” 


The 
second 
Council 
of 
Nice 
says: 
“Nowhere 
has 
the 
Lord, 
nowhere 
have 
the 
Apostles, 
called 
the 
unbloody 
sacrifice 
an 
image, 
but 
the 
Body 
itself, 
and 
the 
Blood 
itself.” 



Nicholas 
Cabasilas, 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
Liturgy 
(c. 
xxxii.), 
writes: 
“It 
is 
not 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
sacrifice, 
nor 
the 
image 
of 
blood, 
but 
real 
immolation 
and 
sacrifice.” 


IfProtestantsweresatisfied 
henceforward 
tospeakthus, 
inunison 
withthe 
holy 
Fathers, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
any 
thing 
remaining 
which 
should 
retard 
peace, 
as 
farasthispointis 
concerned. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


There 
is 
a 
dispute 
between 
Roman 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants, 
Whether 
an 
intention 
is 
requisite 
to 
the 
validity 
of 
a 
sacrament. 
The 
Fathers 
of 
Trent 
maintain 
the 
affirmative 
under 
pain 
of 
anathema, 
and 
this 
anathema, 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Reformation 
to 
the 
present 
time, 
has 
met 
with 
vigorous 
opposition 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Protestants. 
In 
my 
humble 
judgment, 
the 
controversy 
will 
atonce 
be 
decided 
if 
the 
terms 
behonestly 
explained 
andthe 
matter 
set 
in 
its 
proper 
light. 
I 
say 
therefore, 
with 
Becanus, 
that 
the 
minister’s 
intentionregardingthesacramentmaybe 
threefold: 


First, 
an 
intention 
of 
pronouncing 
the 
words 
of 
institution 
and 
performing 
theexternalact. 


Secondly, 
anintentionofcelebrating 
the 
sacrament, 
or,at 
least,a 
confused 
intention 
of 
doing 
that 
which 
the 
Church 
does 
or 
intends. 
And 
this 
intention, 
as 
Becanus 
rightly 
teaches, 
may 
be 
either, 
first, 
actual; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
any 
one 
celebrating 
a 
sacrament 
at 
the 
same 
time 
actually 
thinks 
of 
celebrating 
the 
sacrament: 
or, 
secondly, 
habitual; 
that 
is, 
when 
one 
has 
acquired 
by 
repeated 
acts 
a 
readiness 
for 
celebrating 
the 
sacrament, 
such 
as 
might 
be 
found 
in 
those 
asleep: 
or, 
thirdly, 
virtual; 
when, 
from 
absence 
of 
mind, 
the 
actual 
intention 
is 
not 
present 
at 
the 
moment, 
but 
had 
been 
present, 
and 
the 
operation 
takes 
place 
invirtue 
thereof. 



Thirdly, 
anintentionofcommunicatingthe 
fruit 
or 
effect 
of 
the 
sacrament. 
Becanus 
concludes, 
that 
between 
us 
and 
the 
Romanists 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
concerning 
the 
third 
kind 
of 
intention, 
namely, 
that 
of 
imparting 
the 
fruit 
and 
effect,butmerelyaboutthe 
firsttwo. 


FromthesepremissestheJesuitwhomIhavecitedinfers: 


1. 
That 
a 
habitual 
intention 
is 
not 
sufficient 
for 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
sacrament; 
that, 
however, 
an 
actual 
intention 
is 
not 
necessarily 
required; 
and 
that 
a 
virtual 
intention 
— 
not 
only 
of 
performing 
the 
external 
act, 
but 
of 
completing 
thesacrament 
itself, 
or,atleast, 
aconfusedintentionof 
doing 
that 
which 
the 
Church 
does,or 
Christinstituted, 
isrequiredandinsufficient. 
2. 
That 
an 
express 
intention 
of 
imparting 
the 
fruit 
of 
the 
sacrament 
is 
not 
indispensabletoitsvalidity. 
Now 
according 
to 
this 
explanation, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
dispute 
does 
not 
regard 
the 
matter 
itself, 
but 
merely 
the 
word; 
and 
that 
when 
Protestants 
deny 
that 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
minister 
is 
required 
for 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
sacrament, 
they 
refer 
to 
the 
intention 
of 
conferring 
the 
fruit 
and 
effect, 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Becanus, 
the 
Roman 
Catholics, 
as 
well 
as 
we, 
deny 
to 
be 
requisite; 
whereas, 
the 
latter, 
who 
insist 
upon 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
minister 
for 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
sacrament, 
speak 
simply 
of 
an 
actual, 
or 
at 
least 
virtual 
intention, 
of 
performing 
the 
external 
act, 
or 
doing 
what 
the 
Church 
does 
in 
such 
a 
case. 
That 
such 
an 
intention 
is 
required 
for 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
sacrament,Protestantsareperfectlyfreetograntto 
the 
Roman 
Church. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


There 
is 
a 
question 
between 
us, 
Whether 
the 
sacraments 
of 
the 
New 
Testament 
are 
two 
or 
seven 
in 
number? 
I 
say, 
that 
this 
also 
is 
a 
dispute 
about 
a 
word,arisingfromthedifferentdefinitionsof 
asacramentingeneral. 



If 
we 
understand 
by 
the 
word 
‘sacrament’ 
any 
thing 
sacred, 
instituted 
in 
honour 
of 
God, 
according 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
we 
shall 
have 
not 
seven, 
but, 
possibly, 
six 
hundred 
sacraments. 
If 
we 
take 
the 
term 
‘sacrament’ 
in 
a 
somewhat 
more 
limited 
sense, 
but 
not 
quite 
so 
rigorously 
as 
when 
it 
is 
applied 
to 
Baptism 
and 
the 
Eucharist, 
there 
is 
no 
question 
that 
the 
remaining 
five 
may 
properly 
be 
called 
sacraments. 
The 
question 
is 
not, 
therefore, 
whether 
the 
five 
which 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
add 
to 
our 
two 
can 
be 
called 
sacraments. 
For 
who 
can 
deny 
this 
in 
the 
various 
senses 
which 
are 
attached 
to 
the 
word 
by 
those 
who 
variously 
define 
it? 
But 
the 
question 
is, 
whether 
they 
are 
sacraments 
in 
the 
most 
rigorous 
sense 
of 
the 
term; 
that 
is, 
whether 
they 
are 
such 
sacraments 
as 
Baptism 
and 
the 
Eucharist; 
or, 
to 
speak 
more 
clearly, 
whether 
every 
thing 
essentially 
necessary 
to 
Baptism 
and 
the 
Eucharist 
be 
found 
in 
the 
sacraments 
of 
Matrimony, 
Holy 
Orders, 
Extreme 
Unction, 
and 
the 
others. 
Now, 
in 
Baptism 
and 
the 
Sacrament 
of 
the 
Altar 
are 
required: 
1. 
The 
word 
of 
institution; 
namely, 
that 
it 
should 
have 
been 
instituted 
by 
Christ 
in 
the 
time 
of 
the 
New 
Testament. 
2. 
The 
word 
of 
promise; 
namely, 
that 
it 
should 
have 
annexed 
to 
it 
a 
promise 
of 
sanctifying 
grace. 
3. 
That 
it 
should 
have 
a 
symbol, 
or 
external 
element: 
which 
conditions 
no 
Catholic 
will 
sayare 
required 
in 
Matrimony, 
for 
instance; 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
neither 
was 
established 
during 
the 
time 
of 
the 
New 
Testament, 
but 
commenced 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
world; 
nor 
was 
instituted 
(taking 
the 
word 
in 
its 
essential 
signification) 
specially 
by 
Christ, 
the 
second 
Person 
of 
the 
Divinity, 
but 
by 
God; 
nor 
has 
any 
external 
element, 
and 
far 
less 
any 
accompanying 
promise 
of 
justifying 
grace. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


Another 
question 
between 
the 
parties 
is, 
Whether 
sins 
are 
truly 
taken 
away 
by 
justification. 
The 
dispute 
is 
easily 
determined, 
once 
the 
case 
is 
properly 



stated, 
and 
the 
terms 
employed 
in 
discussing 
the 
subject 
duly 
explained. 
For 
it 
will 
appear 
that, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
there 
is 
something 
in 
sin 
which 
is 
taken 
away 
through 
justification, 
according 
to 
the 
admission 
of 
the 
Catholics, 
and 
that, 
on 
the 
other, 
Protestants 
by 
no 
means 
believe 
the 
opposite 
doctrine, 
which 
theyaresaidto 
maintain. 


In 
order 
that 
we 
may 
understand 
this 
the 
more 
clearly, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
sinsareoftwokinds, 
actual 
and 
habitual; 
and 
that 
in 
each 
two 
things 
are 
tobe 
considered,the 
material 
and 
the 
formal. 


The 
material 
of 
actual 
sins 
consists 
in 
the 
past 
act 
of 
sinning 
or 
the 
past 
omission 
of 
some 
act 
prescribed 
by 
the 
law; 
the 
formal 
of 
actual 
sins 
is 
the 
guilt 
and 
liability 
to 
punishment, 
resulting 
from 
the 
past 
act 
of 
sinning 
or 
omission 
of 
an 
act 
prescribed 
by 
the 
law, 
rendering 
man 
a 
sinner, 
and 
causing 
him 
toincurtheguiltandpunishmentresulting 
fromthe 
same 
beforeGod. 


Habitual 
sins 
are 
original 
sin 
and 
the 
vicious 
habit 
contracted 
by 
evil 
doing: 
the 
material 
of 
which 
is 
the 
habitual 
propensity 
to 
evil; 
the 
formal, 
as 
before, 
the 
guilt 
of 
the 
sin, 
and 
the 
liability 
to 
punishment 
resulting 
therefrom. 


Thequestion,then,astowhether 
sinsaretrulytakenawaybyjustification, 
may 
be 
understood 
as 
referring 
either 
to 
the 
formal 
or 
to 
the 
material 
of 
sin. 
If 
it 
be 
understood 
of 
the 
material, 
Protestants 
take 
the 
negative 
side 
of 
the 
question. 
And, 
as 
far 
as 
actual 
sins 
are 
concerned, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
the 
material 
of 
these 
sins 
is 
not 
removed 
by 
justification. 
For 
this 
material 
consists, 
as 
we 
have 
said, 
in 
the 
act 
of 
sinning 
which 
is 
past, 
or 
the 
past 
omission 
of 
an 
act 
prescribed 
by 
the 
law; 
in 
which 
two 
things 
are 
to 
be 
considered: 
first, 
the 
act 
itself 
committed 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
law; 
and, 
secondly, 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
sinner, 
which 
causes 
it 
to 
be 
said 
that 
he 
has 
sinned. 
If, 
therefore, 
actual 
sins 
are 
removed, 
as 
to 
their 
material, 
by 
justification, 
either 
the 
previous 
act 
is 
taken 
away, 
or 
the 
relation 
of 
this 
act 
to 
the 
sinner; 
so 
that 
it 
will 
be 
true 
to 



say 
of 
him 
who 
sinned 
that 
he 
has 
not 
sinned. 
But 
neither 
can 
be 
said. 
Not 
the 
first; 
because 
the 
previous 
act, 
by 
the 
bare 
circumstance 
of 
being 
passed, 
has 
ceased 
to 
be, 
and 
therefore 
can 
no 
longer 
have 
any 
real 
existence 
capable 
of 
being 
taken 
away 
by 
justification. 
The 
past 
omission 
of 
an 
act 
is 
no 
real 
being, 
but 
a 
negation, 
whose 
existence 
cannot 
be 
taken 
away 
by 
justification, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
has 
none. 
Nor 
can 
the 
second 
be 
said; 
for, 
if 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
sinful 
act 
to 
the 
sinner 
be 
taken 
away 
by 
justification, 
it 
would 
follow, 
that 
he 
who 
had 
sinned 
should 
be 
considered 
not 
to 
have 
sinned, 
and 
what 
had 
been 
done 
not 
to 
have 
been 
done. 
Thus, 
for 
instance, 
the 
same 
man 
should 
have 
fornicated 
and 
not 
fornicated, 
which 
is 
a 
manifest 
contradiction. 
And 
in 
this 
theRomanCatholics,Ithink, 
willagreewithus. 


Withregardtohabitual 
sin,its 
material, 
namely, 
the 
habitual 
propensity 
to 
evil, 
is 
broken, 
crucified, 
mortified, 
and 
subdued 
in 
the 
man 
justified, 
so 
that 
sin 
cannot 
reign 
any 
longer 
in 
his 
mortal 
body. 
However, 
during 
this 
mortal 
life 
it 
is 
not 
thoroughly 
removed, 
it 
is 
not 
extirpated, 
but, 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
remains 
after 
justification; 
for 
which 
reason 
it 
was 
St. 
Paul, 
although 
justified,complains 
somuchofsin 
“thatdwellethinhim.” 


And 
when 
this 
propensity 
to 
evil 
is 
broken 
and 
lessened 
in 
man, 
this 
takes 
placeinconsequencenotofjustification,butof 
regenerationandrenovation. 


So 
far, 
therefore, 
Catholic 
and 
Protestant 
manifestly 
agree 
as 
to 
the 
material 
of 
sin. 
If 
we 
consider 
the 
formal 
of 
sin, 
that 
is, 
the 
guilt 
and 
liability 
to 
punishment, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
question 
here 
is, 
whether 
the 
guilt 
of 
sin 
and 
liability 
to 
punishment 
are 
removed 
from 
the 
man 
justified; 
or 
whether, 
in 
justification,heceasestobeguiltyor 
subjecttopunishmentbeforeGod? 


The 
question 
being 
so 
stated, 
we 
unite 
with 
the 
Catholics 
in 
adopting 
the 
affirmative; 
and 
hold 
that 
sins, 
whether 
actual 
or 
habitual, 
as 
far 
as 
regards 
the 
formal, 
or 
guilt 
and 
liabilitytopunishment, 
are 
truly 
and 
entirelyremoved 
in 
justification 
by 
remission, 
condonation, 
and 
non-imputation. 
To 
this 
extent 



again, 
therefore, 
parties 
are 
agreed. 
But, 
as 
to 
expressions 
used 
by 
some 
Protestant 
theologians, 
namely, 
that 
sin 
is 
not 
taken 
away 
in 
justification, 
but 
remains; 
these 
are 
to 
be 
understood 
of 
original 
sin, 
and 
especially 
of 
evil 
concupiscence, 
which, 
they 
maintain, 
continues 
in 
the 
regenerated, 
not 
formally 
but 
materially; 
that 
is, 
so 
far 
as 
regards 
the 
habitual 
propensity 
to 
evil,butwithoutdominion. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


It 
is 
well 
known 
what 
tragedies 
have 
been 
excited 
in 
the 
Church 
by 
the 
proposition 
which 
our 
Luther 
introduced 
into 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures, 
viz. 
that 
“faith 
alonejustifies;althoughthepropositionisnothisown,andthe 
doctrine 
might 
even 
be 
drawn 
from 
many 
other 
phrases 
found 
in 
Scripture, 
and 
admittedby 
theChurch. 
We 
arejustified,accordingto 
theScripture, 
“by 
faith 
“through 
faith.” 
Properly 
speaking, 
however, 
it 
is 
not 
faith, 
but 
God, 
that 
justifies 
us. 
Now 
He 
has 
one 
internal 
impelling 
cause 
of 
this 
his 
justification; 
namely, 
his 
own 
grace 
and 
mercy; 
one 
principal 
external 
impelling 
cause, 
namely, 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ; 
and 
one 
secondary 
external 
impelling 
cause, 
namely, 
faith. 
When, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
said 
faith 
justifies, 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
proposition 
is 
this: 
on 
the 
part 
of 
man, 
faith 
is 
the 
secondary 
external 
impelling 
cause, 
moving 
God 
to 
our 
justification. 
Whether 
faith 
in 
this 
sense 
alone 
justifies, 
is 
the 
matter 
in 
dispute 
between 
the 
parties. 
Now 
I 
think, 
that 
if 
by 
the 
word 
‘alone’ 
the 
other 
impelling 
causes 
of 
justification 
be 
not 
excluded 
— 
as, 
for 
instance, 
the 
grace 
of 
God 
and 
merits 
of 
Christ 
— 
if 
we 
say 
that 
the 
word 
alone 
(sola) 
is 
not 
to 
be 
confounded 
with 
solitary 
(solitaria), 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
dead 
faith, 
or 
faith 
destitute 
of 
good 
works, 
or 
at 
least 
of 
the 
purpose 
of 
doing 
good, 
— 
I 
think, 
I 
say, 
that 
in 
this 
case 
the 
dispute 
is 
wellnigh 
ended. 
For 
the 
meaning 
will 
then 
resolve 
itself 
into 
this: 
on 
the 
part 
of 
God, 
grace 
and 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ 
are 
the 
impelling 
cause 
of 
our 



justification; 
but, 
on 
the 
part 
of 
man, 
neither 
hope 
nor 
charity, 
nor 
any 
other 
good 
work, 
confer 
justification 
proximately 
and 
immediately: 
but 
in 
this 
sensefaith 
alone 
(not, 
however, 
solitary), 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
such 
faith 
as 
worketh 
by 
charity, 
is 
the 
external 
impelling 
cause 
of 
our 
justification; 
— 
that 
faith, 
namely, 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
man 
believes 
that 
Christ, 
by 
suffering 
and 
dying, 
paid 
the 
most 
ample 
satisfaction 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
whole 
world, 
with 
an 
assurance 
that 
he 
shall 
obtain 
grace 
and 
the 
forgiveness 
of 
his 
sins 
from 
God 
on 
account 
of 
that 
satisfaction; 
a 
faith, 
moreover, 
which 
is 
not 
dead 
but 
living, 
and 
which 
works 
by 
charity, 
and 
manifests 
itself 
in 
action 
whenever 
theoccasionarises. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


Another 
question 
is, 
Whether 
a 
man 
can 
he 
sure 
of 
his 
justification 
and 
of 
his 
final 
perseverance? 
Protestants 
assert 
both; 
nor 
do 
I 
think 
Roman 
Catholics 
will 
dissent 
fromthem, 
ifthe 
questions 
receive 
due 
explanation. 
Itis 
admitted 
on 
both 
sides, 
that 
we 
are 
justified 
by 
faith. 
A 
man, 
therefore, 
who 
believes, 
and 
knows 
that 
he 
believes, 
can 
be 
absolutely 
certain 
of 
his 
faith, 
and 
consequently 
of 
his 
salvation. 
None 
of 
our 
divines, 
however, 
teach 
that 
a 
man 
can 
be 
as 
sure 
of 
his 
salvation 
and 
perseverance, 
as 
of 
his 
justification. 
For 
of 
the 
latter 
he 
can 
have 
an 
absolute 
certainty, 
but 
of 
his 
perseverance 
and 
salvation, 
a 
conditional 
certainty 
only; 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
if 
a 
man 
make 
right 
use 
of 
the 
means 
of 
persevering 
in 
faith, 
does 
not 
reject 
them, 
and 
assiduously 
begs 
the 
assistance 
of 
God 
by 
devout 
prayers 
— 
which 
he 
is 
able 
to 
do 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
grace 
conferred 
upon 
him 
— 
then 
he 
is 
conditionally 
certain 
of 
his 
salvation. 
If 
this 
perseverance 
endure 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life, 
he 
is 
then 
sure 
of 
his 
salvation 
also. 
About 
an 
hundred 
and 
twenty 
years 
ago, 
Martin 
Eisengrein, 
licentiate 
in 
theology 
and 
president 
of 
Ingolstadt, 
a 
moderate 
Catholic 
writer, 
endeavoured 
to 
soften 
down 
the 
thirteenth 
canon 
of 



the 
sixth 
session 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent, 
in 
reference 
to 
this 
matter, 
in 
his 
curious 
and 
comprehensive 
German 
work, 
entitled, 
“A 
moderate 
Declaration 
of 
the 
Articles 
of 
the 
Christian 
Faith, 
necessary 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things,” 
printed 
at 
Ingolstadt 
in 
the 
year 
1568; 
where, 
amongst 
other 
things, 
he 
speaks 
thus 
in 
the 
fifth 
paragraph: 
“I 
say 
it 
in 
plain 
German 
— 
I 
also 
know 
what 
I 
say 
to 
be 
true 
and 
built 
upon 
good 
foundations 
— 
however 
the 
thirteenth 
canon 
of 
the 
sixth 
session 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent 
may 
sound 
in 
your 
ears, 
this 
is 
not 
its 
meaning; 
this 
is 
not 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Council; 
this 
is 
not 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Church, 
and 
never 
was, 
that 
a 
‘Christian 
never 
can 
he 
sure 
of 
his 
salvation 
and 
justification,’&c.” 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


It 
has 
long 
been 
sharply 
canvassed, 
Whether 
it 
he 
possible 
to 
fulfil 
the 
law 
contained 
in 
the 
Decalogue? 
The 
question, 
however, 
has 
not 
been 
argued 
upon 
the 
merits, 
but 
has 
turned 
upon 
the 
manner 
of 
speaking; 
and 
therefore 
it 
may 
be 
decided 
without 
any 
difficulty. 
The 
Protestant 
opinion, 
if 
rightly 
explained, 
is 
this: 
Of 
the 
compacts 
entered 
into 
by 
God 
with 
man, 
one 
is 
legal, 
and 
the 
other 
evangelical: 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
legal 
covenant, 
our 
first 
parents, 
being 
endowed 
with 
the 
Divine 
image, 
were 
obliged 
to 
fulfil 
the 
law 
with 
the 
utmost 
exactness; 
that 
is, 
they 
were 
obliged 
not 
only 
to 
abstain 
from 
all 
sins 
directly 
against 
conscience, 
but 
to 
guard 
against 
any 
concupiscence 
whatsoever, 
even 
indeliberate(in 
actu 
primo), 
or 
against 
all 
those 
indeliberate 
evil 
motions 
which 
the 
schoolmen 
call 
primo-primi. 
By 
virtue 
of 
the 
Gospel 
covenant, 
since 
man, 
deprived 
by 
his 
fall 
of 
the 
Divine 
image, 
cannot 
fulfil 
the 
law 
in 
this 
way, 
God 
requires 
of 
him 
nothing 
more 
than 
that 
he 
shall 
believe 
in 
Christ 
with 
true 
and 
living 
faith, 
and 
shall 
abstain 
from 
mortal 
sins, 
or 
from 
all 
that 
is 
contrary 
to 
conscience. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
venial 
sins, 
or 
concupiscence 
considered 
in 
actu 
primo, 
or 
other 
indeliberate 
evil 
motions, 



God, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
evangelical 
compact, 
promised 
that 
He 
would 
not 
hold 
the 
regenerated 
man 
guilty 
of 
them, 
provided 
he 
begged 
forgiveness 
daily 
and 
took 
other 
similar 
precautions. 
When, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
asked, 
“whether 
the 
regenerated 
man 
can 
and 
ought 
to 
fulfil 
the 
law?” 
I 
answer, 
that 
no 
one, 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
man, 
is 
bound 
to 
fulfil, 
or 
is 
capable 
of 
fulfilling, 
the 
law, 
in 
the 
same 
degree 
of 
perfection 
as 
the 
first 
men 
were 
bound 
to 
do 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
legal 
covenant; 
and 
if 
the 
Decalogue 
be 
enforced 
to 
the 
rigour 
of 
this 
legal 
covenant, 
I 
say 
that 
no 
one 
is 
bound 
to 
its 
observance, 
as 
being 
a 
thing 
impossible. 
But 
every 
regenerated 
man 
is 
obliged 
to 
observe 
thelaw, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
itis 
exacted 
of 
him 
by 
the 
Gospel 
covenant; 
and 
to 
such 
extent 
also 
has 
the 
regenerated 
man 
the 
power 
to 
observe 
the 
law 
of 
the 
Decalogue 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
grace, 
‘provided 
only 
he 
use 
his 
utmost 
diligence. 
If 
the 
question 
be 
so 
explained, 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
what 
more 
the 
Roman 
Church 
need 
look 
for 
in 
the 
Protestant 
declaration. 
Father 
Dionysius, 
in 
his 
Way 
of 
Peace, 
truly 
says: 
“With 
regard 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
fulfilling 
the 
law, 
there 
exists 
in 
fact 
and 
in 
truth 
no 
difference 
of 
opinion 
(between 
the 
Protestants 
and 
Catholics). 
Since 
Protestants 
teach 
that 
many 
justified 
by 
inherent 
justice, 
and 
possessing 
the 
aid 
of 
Divine 
grace, 
can 
so 
far 
observe 
and 
perform 
the 
commands 
of 
God 
as 
not 
to 
lose 
his 
grace 
and 
friendship, 
or 
consummate 
the 
sin 
to 
which 
he 
is 
inclined 
by 
concupiscence; 
but 
that 
he 
is 
not 
so 
perfectly 
and 
strictly 
free 
from 
all 
sin 
as 
to 
avoid 
every 
venial 
sin. 
Catholics 
acknowledge 
likewise 
that 
it 
is 
our 
duty 
to 
keep 
the 
commandments 
of 
God 
and 
avoid 
all 
sin; 
but 
they 
say 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
do 
so 
during 
one’s 
entire 
life, 
or 
for 
any 
long 
time, 
without 
a 
special 
privilege. 
(See 
St. 
Thomas, 
1a 
2ae 
quest, 
xix. 
art. 
8.) 
Nay 
more, 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent, 
Sess. 
vi. 
can. 
23, 
visits 
with 
anathema 
any 
one 
who 
says 
that 
the 
justified 
man 
can, 
during 
his 
whole 
life, 
avoid 
all 
sins, 
even 
venial, 
without 
special 
privilege 
from 
God. 
Protestants 
should 
therefore 
be 
satisfied 
when 
Catholics 
teach 
that 
the 
just 
man 
cannot 
so 
perfectly 
keep 
the 



commandments 
as 
not 
to 
transgress 
them 
somewhat 
by 
sinning 
venially 
from 
time 
to 
time; 
and 
it 
should 
be 
enough 
for 
Catholics 
that 
it 
is 
only 
in 
this 
sense 
Protestants 
say 
the 
just 
man 
cannot 
keep 
the 
commandments 
of 
God.” 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


There 
is 
a 
question, 
Whether 
indeliberate 
motions 
(primo-primi), 
concupiscence 
“in 
actu 
primo” 
and 
other 
sins 
esteemed 
venial 
by 
us, 
are 
against 
the 
law 
of 
God? 
The 
aforesaid 
Capuchin, 
whose 
words 
we 
quote, 
has 
put 
an 
end 
to 
this 
controversy. 
“Some 
Catholics 
say 
that 
venial 
sins 
are 
not 
against 
the 
law, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
are 
not 
against 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
law; 
for 
they 
are 
not 
against 
the 
law, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
obliges 
under 
pain 
of 
losing 
the 
grace 
and 
friendship 
of 
God 
and 
incurring 
His 
exterminating 
wrath. 
This 
is 
the 
first 
and 
largest 
extension 
of 
the 
law. 
But 
they 
are 
against 
the 
law, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
obliges 
to 
avoid 
the 
smallest 
offence 
of 
God 
and 
his 
chastening 
wrath, 
which 
is 
its 
second 
extension; 
and 
they 
are 
also 
against 
the 
law 
so 
far 
as 
it 
requires 
to 
be 
observed 
with 
such 
exactness 
as 
to 
please 
God 
by 
doing 
and 
suffering 
even 
out 
of 
pure 
love 
for 
him, 
which 
is 
its 
third 
extension. 
Considered 
in 
the 
first 
extension, 
the 
just 
man 
can 
walk 
in 
the 
law 
without 
offence 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God; 
considered 
in 
the 
second 
and 
third, 
no 
one, 
how 
just 
soever, 
can 
walk 
therein 
save 
by 
the 
special 
privilege 
of 
Almighty 
God, 
without 
transgressing 
by 
turning 
aside, 
although 
continuing 
to 
walk 
within 
its 
limits, 
as 
explained 
in 
the 
first 
sense, 
and 
therefore 
not 
simply 
walking 
and 
acting 
against 
the 
law, 
but 
only 
under 
a 
certain 
respect. 
Those, 
then, 
who 
deny 
that 
venial 
sins 
are 
against 
the 
law, 
keep 
in 
view 
the 
first 
extension 
of 
the 
law; 
and 
those 
who 
affirm 
it, 
the 
second. 
And 
since 
we 
are 
agreed 
upon 
the 
substance, 
as 
Gerson 
says, 
in 
his 
Treatise 
on 
the 
Spiritual 
Life 
of 
the 
Soul 
(Lect. 
v.),itisidle 
todisputeaboutwords 
withobstinateanimosity.” 



ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


There 
is 
another 
question, 
Whether 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
just 
are 
in 
themselves 
perfectly 
good 
and 
free 
from 
all 
taint 
of 
sin? 
Protestants 
deny 
this; 
and 
perhaps 
so 
do 
Catholics, 
if 
the 
thing 
be 
rightly 
explained: 
for 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
justified 
are 
said 
to 
be 
imperfect 
in 
relation 
to 
their 
imperfect 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
law. 
Because, 
inasmuch 
as, 
after 
the 
fall 
of 
man, 
no 
one 
can 
fulfil 
the 
law 
as 
perfectly 
as 
he 
was 
bound 
to 
do 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
legal 
compact, 
it 
is 
self-evident 
that 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
just 
must 
be 
of 
such 
a 
character 
as 
always 
to 
fall 
short 
of 
perfection. 
But, 
as 
for 
those 
who 
thence 
infer 
that 
Protestants 
consider 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
just 
to 
be 
mere 
iniquity 
and 
sins; 
let 
them 
know 
that 
Protestants 
consider 
any 
such 
propositions 
utterly 
false, 
although 
some 
Protestants, 
who 
thought 
upon 
these 
matters 
more 
correctly 
than 
they 
expressed 
themselves, 
may 
have 
adopted 
those 
propositions. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


It 
is 
also 
asked, 
Whether 
the 
works 
of 
the 
regenerated 
are 
‘pleasing 
to 
God? 
And 
here 
again 
there 
is 
no 
substantial 
difference 
between 
us. 
In 
order 
to 
shew 
this, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
proposed 
question 
admits 
of 
a 
twofold 
sense; 
first, 
whether 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
regenerated, 
considered 
in 
themselves, 
are 
pleasing 
to 
God? 
Secondly, 
whether, 
taken 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
faith 
of 
the 
doers, 
or 
regard 
being 
had 
to 
all 
the 
circumstances, 
they 
are 
pleasing 
to 
God? 
To 
the 
question 
understood 
in 
the 
first 
sense, 
answer 
is 
to 
be 
made, 
that 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
regenerated 
are 
not 
simply 
and 
absolutely 
pleasing 
to 
God, 
because 
they 
are 
not 
simply 
or 
absolutely 
good, 
and 
have 
their 
imperfections 
annexed 
to 
them; 
but 
that 
they 
are 
pleasing 
to 
God 
notwithstanding, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
are 
conformable 
to 
the 
law; 
and 
whatever 



is 
conformable 
to 
the 
Divine 
law 
is 
good, 
and 
whatever 
is 
good 
pleases 
God. 
But 
if 
the 
question 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
latter 
sense, 
the 
answer 
is, 
that 
the 
works 
of 
the 
regenerated 
are 
pleasing 
to 
God 
absolutely 
and 
simply. 
For 
although, 
considered 
in 
themselves, 
they 
are 
imperfect, 
and 
although 
these 
inherent 
imperfections 
cannot 
be 
pleasing 
to 
God, 
nevertheless, 
because 
they 
proceed 
from 
faith 
in 
Christ, 
and 
are 
performed 
by 
those 
who 
are 
in 
Christ 
Jesus 
and 
“in 
whom 
there 
is 
no 
condemnation,” 
these 
inherent 
imperfections 
are 
excused 
in 
the 
agents, 
in 
consideration 
of 
Christ 
and 
of 
his 
merit 
which 
they 
lay 
hold 
on 
by 
faith; 
and 
therefore 
their 
works 
are 
pleasing 
to 
God 
simply 
and 
absolutely, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
if 
they 
were 
altogether 
and 
in 
every 
respect 
perfect, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
merit 
of 
Christ 
laid 
hold 
on 
by 
true 
faith. 


Many 
other 
such 
controversies 
might 
be 
adduced; 
but 
these 
few 
will 
suffice 
as 
a 
specimen. 
For 
the 
adjustment 
of 
questions 
of 
this 
class 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
a 
new 
council, 
general 
or 
provincial, 
but 
merely 
that 
they 
be 
discussed 
by 
a 
few 
unprejudiced, 
learned, 
and 
moderate 
divines 
of 
both 
sides; 
and 
the 
different 
acceptation 
of 
the 
terms 
being 
seen, 
the 
matter 
can 
be 
brought 
to 
a 
conclusion 
without 
much 
trouble 
intheproposedconference. 


SECONDCLASS. 


To 
the 
second 
class 
belong 
questions, 
controverted, 
indeed, 
but 
of 
such 
a 
character 
that 
the 
opposite 
opinions 
are 
tolerated 
in 
either 
of 
the 
Churches. 
In 
such 
instances, 
for 
peace-sake, 
that 
opinion 
should 
be 
adopted 
on 
both 
sides 
which 
the 
entire 
body 
of 
one 
of 
the 
Churches 
and 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
other 
maintain. 


FIRSTEXAMPLE. 



The 
entire 
Roman 
Church 
approves 
of 
prayers 
for 
the 
dead; 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Protestant 
Churches, 
following 
the 
guidance 
of 
the 
Apology 
of 
the 
Confession 
of 
Augsburg, 
hasdetermined 
them 
to 
be 
lawful;a 
portionactually 
does 
pray 
for 
the 
dead. 
There 
are 
some 
Protestants, 
however, 
by 
whom 
this 
intercession 
for 
the 
dead 
is 
not 
approved. 
For 
the 
sake, 
therefore, 
of 
restoring 
peace, 
the 
Protestants 
in 
the 
proposed 
congress 
shall 
be 
solicited 
to 
consent 
that

ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


A 
portion 
of 
the 
Roman 
Church 
holds 
the 
immaculate 
conception 
of 
the 
Blessed 
Virgin 
Mary; 
a 
portion 
disallows 
it. 
The 
entire 
Church 
of 
the 
Protestants, 
while 
admitting 
the 
blessed 
Mary 
to 
be 
most 
holy 
and 
full 
of 
grace, 
has 
decided 
that 
she 
was 
conceived 
in 
original 
sin; 
therefore, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
peace 
and 
concord, 
the 
Catholics 
in 
the 
aforesaid 
meeting 
shall 
be 
invitedto

ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


Concerning 
the 
merit 
of 
good 
works, 
there 
are 
two 
celebrated 
opinions 
in 
the 
Roman 
Church; 
one 
of 
Vasquez 
and 
his 
followers, 
the 
other 
of 
Scotus 
and 
all 
the 
Scotists. 
Scotus, 
the 
“subtle 
doctor,” 
teaches, 
that 
the 
works 
of 
the 
regenerated 
are 
not 
meritorious 
of 
themselves, 
nor 
intrinsically, 
but 
that 
whatever 
merit 
they 
have 
is 
derived 
from 
God’s 
acceptance, 
and 
their 
ordination 
to 
reward. 
Vasquez 
and 
his 
adherents 
maintain, 
that 
the 
good 
works 
of 
the 
just 
do 
of 
themselves, 
without 
any 
compact 
or 
favour 
of 
acceptance, 
condignly 
merit 
eternal 
life, 
and 
that 
no 
additional 
dignity 
accrues 
to 
them 
from 
the 
merits 
or 
person 
of 
Christ, 
which 
they 
should 
not 
otherwise 
have 
from 
the 
fact 
of 
their 
being 
done 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God; 
and 
further 
that, 
although 
there 
be 
a 
Divine 
promise 
attached 
to 
the 
works 
of 
the 



just, 
yet 
neither 
it, 
nor 
any 
other 
compact 
or 
favour, 
appertains 
in 
any 
way 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
merit. 
In 
order 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
peace 
between 
the 
parties, 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
must 
be 
invited 
to 
embrace 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Scotists 
— 
(and 
how 
eminent 
are 
their 
schools, 
how 
numerous, 
how 
celebrated!) 
— 
which 
opinion 
substantially 
agrees 
with 
that 
of 
the 
Protestants. 
For 
Scotus 
and 
his 
companions 
deny 
that 
good 
works 
are 
properly 
and 
condignly 
meritorious; 
and 
decide, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
they 
can 
be 
called 
meritorious, 
only 
in 
that 
loose 
and 
extended 
sense 
in 
which 
one 
is 
said 
to 
merit 
who 
receives 
any 
thing 
from 
another, 
although 
it 
be 
gratuitously, 
and 
from 
the 
mere 
liberality 
or 
free 
remission 
of 
the 
other. 
And 
in 
this 
sense 
the 
holy 
Fathers 
taught 
that 
good 
works 
are 
meritorious, 
and 
Protestants 
are 
perfectly 
prepared 
to 
grant 
the 
same; 
— 
as 
Vasquez 
well 
observes, 
when 
he 
writes, 
that 
Scotus 
and 
the 
others 
who 
adopt 
his 
opinion 
agree 
with 
the 
Lutherans 
in 
holding, 
that 
before 
the 
divine 
promise 
and 
acceptance 
our 
good 
works 
give 
no 
title 
to 
life 
everlasting; 
because 
the 
Scotists 
and 
Lutherans 
alike, 
in 
reference 
to 
works 
good 
in 
themselves, 
ascribe 
all 
the 
worth 
of 
our 
works 
to 
the 
favour 
of 
God 
and 
acceptance 
through 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ, 
and 
also 
because 
they 
take 
from 
works 
the 
true 
and 
perfect 
principle 
of 
our 
merit, 
and 
ascribe 
the 
entire 
virtue 
of 
merit 
to 
the 
works 
of 
Christ 
only.” 
Let 
this 
be 
compared 
with 
what 
the 
Capuchin 
Father, 
Dionysius, 
teaches 
in 
the 
2d, 
3d, 
4th, 
5th, 
and 
6th 
articles 
of 
the 
second 
chapter 
of 
his 
Way 
of 
Peace, 
which 
I 
have 
already 
more 
than 
once 
quoted 
with 
honour, 
and 
it 
will 
appear 
manifest 
that, 
in 
the 
controversy 
regarding 
the 
merits 
of 
works, 
there 
is 
almost 
no 
difference 
between 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants. 
The 
second 
article 
of 
the 
above-cited 
author 
has 
this 
title: 
“Protestants 
say 
that 
good 
works 
merit 
the 
aid 
of 
actual 
grace 
and 
the 
increase 
of 
habitual 
grace;’ 
the 
third 
article, 
“Protestants 
teach 
that 
good 
works 
truly 
merit 
degrees 
of 
heavenly 
glory 
the 
fourth 
article, 
that 



“Protestants 
teach 
that 
we 
may 
entertain 
some 
confidence 
from 
good 
works 
the 
fifth 
article, 
“It 
is 
not 
improbable 
that 
the 
first 
degree 
of 
glory 
does 
not 
fall 
within 
the 
compass 
of 
merit 
the 
sixth 
article, 
“The 
good 
works 
of 
the 
just, 
in 
themselves 
and 
on 
account 
of 
themselves, 
are 
not 
strictly 
and 
condignly 
meritorious.” 
In 
fine, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
brothers 
von 
Walenburch, 
on 
the 
merit 
of 
works, 
is 
of 
the 
same 
tenor: 
That 
although, 
as 
regards 
the 
grace 
of 
justification 
and 
the 
substance 
of 
celestial 
glory, 
there 
is 
no 
merit, 
yet 
there 
is 
as 
regards 
the 
accident 
or 
increase, 
or, 
as 
they 
say, 
as 
regards 
the 
second 
degree 
of 
this 
glory; 
giving 
the 
name 
of 
merit 
in 
its 
broadest 
sense 
to 
every 
act 
which, 
through 
the 
grace 
of 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
is 
produced 
by 
man 
justified, 
and 
to 
which, 
although 
it 
has 
no 
intrinsic 
worth 
and 
no 
proportion 
to 
the 
reward 
or 
to 
eternal 
glory, 
such 
reward 
is 
nevertheless 
mercifully 
promised, 
and 
is 
truly 
and 
properly 
attained. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


The 
entire 
Roman 
Church 
teaches 
that 
good 
works 
are 
necessary 
to 
salvation. 
This 
some 
Protestants 
maintain, 
others 
deny. 
Those 
who 
deny 
it, 
entertain 
a 
concealed 
fear 
lest 
too 
much 
should 
be 
attributed 
to 
good 
works 
on 
the 
score 
of 
justification. 
But 
the 
meaning 
of 
those 
who 
affirm 
it 
amounts 
to 
this 
— 
that 
good 
works 
are 
necessary 
to 
salvation, 
not 
in 
virtue 
of 
their 
efficacy, 
but 
because 
their 
presence 
is 
indispensable 
to 
salvation; 
not 
as 
a 
cause, 
strictly 
speaking, 
of 
salvation, 
either 
principal 
or 
instrumental, 
but 
as 
a 
condition 
sine 
quâ 
non. 
For 
St. 
Paul 
expressly 
says, 
Without 
holiness, 
that 
is, 
without 
good 
works, 
no 
one 
shall 
see 
God. 
Whence 
it 
may 
be 
argued, 
That 
without 
which 
no 
one 
shall 
see 
God, 
— 
in 
other 
words, 
without 
which 
no 
one 
shall 
be 
saved, 
— 
is 
necessary 
in 
some 
way 
to 
serving 
God, 
or 
obtaining 
everlasting 
salvation; 
but 
without 
good 
works 
no 
one 
shall 
see 
God; 
therefore,&c. 



Compare 
with 
this 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Capuchin 
in 
the 
passage 
already 
quoted. 


The 
Protestants 
aretherefore 
to 
be 
invitedtounite 
in 
adopting 
theCatholic 
viewuponthispoint. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


The 
entire 
Protestant 
Church 
is 
averse 
to 
the 
adoration 
of 
the 
Host, 
through 
fear 
of 
idolatry, 
not 
indeed 
formal, 
but 
at 
all 
events 
material. 
In 
the 
Roman 
Church, 
some 
teach 
that 
the 
adoration 
in 
the 
Eucharist 
has 
for 
its 
object 
the 
presence 
of 
Christ; 
some, 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Host. 
The 
Catholics, 
therefore, 
in 
the 
imperial 
congress, 
must 
be 
invited 
to 
make 
no 
difficulty 
of 
consenting 
that 
the 
object 
of 
adoration 
shall 
be 
determined 
to 
be, 
Christ 
present 
in 
the 
Eucharist. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


The 
dogma 
of 
the 
Ubiquity 
of 
the 
Body 
of 
Christ 
is 
denied 
by 
the 
Roman 
Church 
and 
several 
Protestants. 
Some 
Protestants 
maintain 
it. 
Such 
Protestants, 
therefore, 
are 
to 
be 
invited 
in 
the 
assembly 
to 
give 
up 
the 
ubiquity, 
and 
to 
consent 
to 
adopt 
the 
opinion 
of 
many 
brethren 
of 
their 
own 
confession 
andofthe 
entireRomanChurch. 


ANOTHEREXAMPLE. 


The 
Churches 
of 
the 
Protestants 
objected 
to 
have 
the 
Vulgate 
Version 
forced 
upon 
them 
for 
authority. 
They 
likewise 
condemn 
the 
canon 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Trentuponthesubject. 
Andrada,thecelebratedcommentatoronthatCouncil, 
Salmeron, 
Serrarius, 
Simeon 
de 
Muis, 
Conti, 
Giulio 
Ruggieri, 
and 
others, 
havegivenit 
amild 
interpretationofthecanon. 



Simeon 
de 
Muis, 
in 
his 
work 
upon 
the 
Hebrew 
Editions 
[p. 
41], 
says, 
“The 
holy 
Council 
of 
Trent 
does 
not 
disparage 
the 
Hebrew 
edition, 
when, 
in 
its 
fourth 
session, 
it 
decrees 
that 
the 
old 
and 
Vulgate 
edition 
is 
to 
be 
considered 
authentic; 
for 
in 
that 
place 
it 
compares 
the 
Vulgate 
with 
other 
Latin 
editions, 
not 
with 
the 
Hebrew.” 


Andrada, 
in 
the 
fourth 
book 
of 
his 
Defensio 
Fidei, 
holds, 
a 
That 
the 
Fathers 
of 
the 
Council, 
in 
pronouncing 
the 
Vulgate 
edition 
authentic, 
meant 
nothing 
more 
than 
that 
it 
was 
without 
any 
taint 
of 
error 
from 
which 
a 
dogma 
pernicious 
to 
faith 
or 
morals 
might 
be 
inferred; 
but 
that 
they 
did 
not 
so 
approve 
the 
Vulgate 
in 
every 
particular, 
as 
to 
exclude 
any 
hesitation 
or 
doubt 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
translator 
may 
have 
rightly 
rendered 
the 
Scripture.” 
And 
he 
further 
declares, 
that 
he 
“was 
so 
informed 
by 
Andrew 
Vega, 
Cardinal 
of 
Santa 
Croce, 
who 
was 
afterwards 
Pope, 
under 
the 
name 
of 
Marcellus, 
and 
tookpartintheCouncil.” 


Conti 
(lib. 
v. 
Polit, 
cap. 
xxiv. 
prop. 
13,) 
says, 
quoting 
from 
Serrarius, 
that 
“the 
Latin 
Version 
was 
approved 
in 
such 
a 
sense, 
as 
not 
to 
interfere 
with 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
Greek 
and 
Hebrew; 
and 
that 
the 
authority 
adjudged 
by 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent 
to 
the 
Vulgate 
was 
restricted 
to 
it 
as 
a 
translation, 
and 
with 
these 
modifications, 
that 
it 
was 
correct, 
or 
rather, 
most 
correct, 
and 
that 
it 
has, 
at 
least, 
nothing 
repugnant 
to 
truth, 
faith, 
and 
good 
morals.” 


Serrarius, 
in 
his 
Prolegomena 
(chap. 
xix. 
quæst. 
12), 
says, 
“It 
is 
sufficiently 
plain, 
that 
a 
pure 
fountain 
must 
have 
some 
advantage 
over 
any 
stream 
issuing 
therefrom, 
how 
pure 
soever 
it 
may 
be; 
for 
a 
version 
is 
said 
to 
be 
authentic 
when 
it 
is 
considered 
to 
agree 
with 
the 
original 
Giulio 
Ruggieri, 
Secretary 
Apostolic, 
in 
the 
14th 
chap, 
of 
his 
Book 
upon 
the 
Canonical 
Scriptures, 
asks, 
“What 
pious 
man 
is 
there 
whose 
ears 
could 
endure 
to 
hear 
that 
the 
Hebrew 
edition, 
dictated 
by 
the 
Holy 
Ghost 
in 
the 
very 
words 
we 
read, 
written 
by 
the 
Prophets, 
restored 
by 
Esdras, 
cited 
and 
explained 
by 



Christ, 
from 
which 
all 
other 
editions 
have 
emanated, 
as 
from 
their 
parent 
and 
fountain, 
according 
to 
which 
corrections 
are 
made, 
and 
discrepancies 
occurring 
through 
the 
fault 
of 
editors 
removed, 
was 
now 
discarded?” 


Many 
more 
such 
writers 
might 
be 
quoted, 
and 
especially 
Simon, 
in 
several 
passages 
of 
his 
Critical 
History 
of 
the 
Old 
Testament; 
and 
if 
the 
rest 
of 
Catholics 
agree 
with 
these, 
the 
controversy

the

of

To

the 
examination 
of 
which, 
once 
the 
preliminary 
union 
shall 
have 
been 
secured, 
may, 
after 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Basil 
and 
others, 
beagain 
referredto 
the

The 
decision 
of 
these 
and 
such 
other 
articles, 
and 
especially 
of 
such 
as 
cannot 
be 
allowed 
to 
remain 
undecided 
without 
scandal 
to 
either 
party 
or 
injury 
to 
the 
Christian 
commonwealth, 
and 
without 
which 
a 
firm 
and 
enduring 
ecclesiastical 
union 
cannot 
be 
obtained, 
and 
certainly 
cannot 
be 
maintained, 
should 
either 
be 
entrusted 
to 
certain 
arbitrators 
chosen 
upon 
both 
sides, 
men 
conspicuous 
for 
learning, 
judgment, 
piety, 
and 
moderation, 
or 
referred 
to 
a 
council. 
This 
method 
of 
conference 
by 
arbitrators 
met 
the 
approval 
of 
both 
parties 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Confession 
of 
Augsburg, 
and 
was 
commenced 
at 
Augsburg 
in 
the 
thirtieth 
year 
of 
the 
last 
century; 
and 
the 
result 
was 
a 
considerable 
degree 
of 
unanimity 
upon 
no 
small 
number 
of 
subjects, 
and 
those 
not 
amongst 
the 
least 
important. 
So 
much 
so, 
that, 
in 
writing 
of 
this 
discussion 
or 
conference, 
David 
Chytræus 
says, 
in 
his 
Saxon 
Chronicle 
[book 
xiii,], 
that 
“never 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
these 
contests 
in 
Germany 
did 
the 
opposite 
religious 
parties 
seemto 
approximate 
so 
closely, 
or 
do 
they 
ever 
seem 
likely, 
till 
the 
end 
of 
time, 
to 
approach 
more 
near.” 
And 
whatever 
authority 
attaches 
to 
the 
judgment 
or 
the 
prediction 
of 
the 
historian 
on 
this 
point, 
one 
thing 
is 
certain, 
that 
out 
of 
twenty-one 
articles 
of 
the 



Confession 
of 
Augsburg, 
fifteen 
were 
in 
a 
short 
time 
settled, 
the 
decision 
of 
three 
reserved 
to 
a 
general 
council, 
and 
there 
were 
but 
three 
upon 
which 
a 
manifestdisagreementcontinued. 


If 
any 
one 
have 
a 
mind 
to 
try 
what 
decision 
can 
be 
come 
to 
in 
one 
or 
two 
articles 
of 
the 
third 
class, 
to 
me 
it 
is 
nowise 
doubtful 
that 
a 
great 
many 
of 
them 
may 
be 
set 
at 
rest 
by 
an 
accommodating 
explanation. 
Let 
us 
now 
see 
whether 
the 
casebereally 
so. 


The 
main 
dispute 
will, 
as 
it 
appears 
to 
me, 
include 
the 
dogmas 
of 
purgatory, 
invocation 
of 
the 
saints, 
worship 
of 
images, 
monastic 
vows, 
sacred 
traditions, 
unwritten 
word 
of 
God, 
transubstantiation, 
the 
primacy 
of 
the 
Pope, 
so 
far 
as 
he 
claims 
such 
jurisdiction 
as 
of 
divine 
right, 
and 
his 
infallibility. 


We 
shall 
therefore 
try 
whether, 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
any 
individual, 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
aforesaid 
controversies 
may 
not 
be 
brought 
to 
a 
close 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
a 
council, 
by 
accommodating 
explanations. 
I 
say, 
therefore, 


OF 
TRANSUBSTANTIATION, 
That 
this 
question 
of 
the 
mode 
of 
the 
Presence, 
as 
far 
as 
those 
Protestants 
are 
concerned 
who 
admit 
the 
real 
presence 
and 
the 
oral 
eating 
of 
Christ 
in 
the 
Lord’s 
Supper, 
is 
of 
very 
little 
importance; 
and 
that 
by 
Luther 
at 
least, 
provided 
there 
were 
no 
danger 
of 
idolatry, 
the 
error 
was 
considered 
trivial, 
and 
the 
subject 
was 
regarded 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
class 
of 
sophistical 
questions. 
As 
regards 
the 
question 
itself, 
Protestants 
allow 
that 
by 
consecration 
some 
change 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
Eucharist; 
but 
they 
usually 
maintain 
that 
this 
change 
is 
merely 
accidental, 
so 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
bread 
isnot 
changed;but, 
from 
common 
and 
ordinary 
bread, 
it 
becomes 
a 
sacred 
bread, 
bread 
devoted 
to 
this 
most 
sacred 
use, 
a 
bread 
which, 
in 
its 
actual 
use, 
is 
the 
communication 
of 
the 
body 
of 
Christ. 
Amongst 
Protestants, 
M. 
Drejer, 
Professor 
of 
Königsburg, 



admits, 
in 
a 
certain 
sense, 
a 
substantial 
change. 
I 
do 
not 
myself 
adopt 
this 
opinion; 
but 
I 
think 
I 
should 
say 
nothing 
against 
the 
analogy 
of 
faith 
in 
supposing 
that, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
words 
of 
institution, 
some 
mysterious 
change 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
Lord’s 
Supper, 
by 
which, 
in 
a 
manner 
inscrutable 
to 
us, 
this 
proposition, 
so 
frequently 
affirmed 
by 
the 
holy 
Fathers, 
becomes 
true, 
namely, 
“The 
Bread 
is 
the 
Body 
of 
Christ.” 
Roman 
Catholics 
are 
therefore 
to 
be 
invited, 
for 
peace-sake, 
in 
the 
proposed 
convention, 
to 
abstract 
from 
the 
mode 
of 
transubstantiation 
in 
the 
Eucharist, 
and 
to 
be 
satisfied 
to 
say 
with 
us, 
that 
this 
mode 
is 
incomprehensible 
and 
inexplicable, 
but 
of 
such 
a 
character 
that, 
by 
means 
of 
some 
hidden 
and 
wonderful 
change, 
the 
bread 
becomes 
the 
Body 
of 
Christ; 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
those 
Protestants 
to 
whom 
this 
may 
appear 
new, 
must 
be 
invited 
to 
imitate 
the 
first 
Reformers 
in 
waiving 
all 
objection 
to 
such 
propositions 
as, 
the 
Bread 
is 
the 
Body 
of 
Christ, 
the 
Wine 
is 
the 
Blood 
of 
Christ; 
and 
to 
reflect 
besides, 
that 
these 
propositions 
were 
of 
old 
so 
universally 
considered 
true, 
that 
scarce 
one 
of 
the 
early 
doctors 
of 
the 
Church 
is 
to 
be 
found 
who 
has 
not 
taken 
delight 
in 
these 
or 
similar 
expressionsconcerningthe 
Eucharist. 


OFTHEINVOCATIONOFSAINTS. 


With 
regard 
to 
the 
invocation 
of 
saints 
also, 
the 
danger 
alleged 
by 
Protestants 
will 
disappear, 
if 
the 
Romanists 
publicly 
protest 
that 
they 
put 
no 
trust 
in 
departed 
saints 
beyond 
what 
they 
repose 
in 
those 
living 
friends 
whose 
intercession 
they 
implore; 
and 
that 
their 
prayers, 
all 
and 
each, 
in 
whatsoever 
words 
or 
form 
conceived, 
are 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
no 
other 
than 
an 
intercessional 
sense. 
So 
that, 
for 
instance, 
when 
they 
say, 
“Holy 
Mary, 
free 
me 
in 
the 
hour 
of 
death!” 
they 
mean, 
“Holy 
Mary, 
intercede 
for 
me 
with 
your 
Son, 
that 
He 
may 
free 
me 
in 
the 
hour 
of 
death!” 
If, 
in 
addition, 
the 
Romanists 
would 
teach 
their 
brethren, 
that 
the 
invocation 
of 
saints 
is 
not 
strictly 
prescribed 
by 
the 



Councilof 
Trent,but 
that 
it 
is 
left 
to 
eachone’s 
discretionwhetherhe 
address 
his 
prayers 
direct 
to 
God 
or 
through 
the 
saints; 
that 
we 
need 
not 
invoke 
the 
saints 
at 
random 
and 
without 
necessity; 
but 
that 
it 
is 
to 
be 
done 
especially 
on 
those 
occasions 
when, 
on 
account 
of 
some 
grievous 
sin, 
a 
man, 
in 
his 
apprehension 
of 
the 
wrath 
of 
God 
and 
his 
sense 
of 
humility, 
dares 
not 
raise 
his 
eyes 
or 
direct 
his 
prayers 
immediately 
to 
God; 
that 
moreover, 
prayer 
directly 
addressed 
to 
God 
is 
far 
more 
efficacious 
than 
any 
to 
departed 
saints; 
and 
that 
the 
most 
perfect 
prayer 
of 
all 
is 
that 
which, 
as 
far 
as 
can 
be, 
leaves 
everycreatureoutof 
view,and 
dwellsinthedepthof 
thedivineattributes. 


Indeed, 
if 
the 
thing 
be 
so 
explained, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
what 
more 
need 
be 
required 
in 
those 
prayers, 
unless 
perhaps 
this; 
that, 
since 
we 
are 
uncertain 
whether 
every 
saint 
in 
particular 
is 
acquainted 
with 
our 
special 
need, 
the 
assuranceofour 
being 
heardmust 
always 
be 
doubtful. 
Whether 
thedoubt 
can 
be 
removed 
by 
adopting 
the 
form, 
“Holy 
Mary, 
if 
thou 
knowest 
my 
misery, 
pray 
for 
me.” 
let 
others 
decide: 
I 
suspend 
my 
judgment. 
We 
venture 
meanwhile 
to 
anticipate 
with 
earnestness 
that 
the 
stronger 
forms 
of 
addressing 
the 
saints, 
which 
are 
as 
displeasing 
to 
moderate 
Catholics 
as 
to 
us, 
will 
be 
given 
up; 
we 
mean 
such 
as 
are 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
“Psalter 
of 
Mary,” 
the 
“Novena 
of 
St. 
Anthony,” 
and 
other 
monastic 
formularies. 
It 
should 
be 
enough 
for 
Protestants, 
however, 
that 
these 
forms, 
in 
whatever 
way 
they 
are 
expressed, 
are 
understood 
to 
imply 
intercession 
merely. 
And 
should 
this 
interpretation 
chance 
to 
appear 
to 
any 
of 
our 
brethren 
to 
be 
somewhat 
forced, 
I 
pray 
them 
to 
reflect 
that 
such 
methods 
of 
speaking 
and 
such 
explanations 
are 
not 
unusual 
in 
common 
life. 
Suppose, 
for 
instance, 
a 
thief 
or 
robber 
thrown 
into 
prison 
should 
address 
the 
prime 
minister 
of 
the 
king 
or 
prince 
in 
these 
words: 
“Free 
me 
from 
the 
misery 
of 
this 
dungeon 
“Remove 
from 
me 
the 
sentence 
of 
death;” 
the 
thief 
or 
robber 
in 
question 
knows 
very 
well 
that 
the 
prime 
minister 
of 
the 
king 
or 
prince 
has 
no 
such 
power, 
but 
that 
it 
rests 



with 
the 
king 
or 
prince 
alone 
to 
do 
so; 
and 
therefore 
his 
prayer 
is, 
in 
effect, 
no 
other 
than 
that 
the 
minister 
should 
intercede 
with 
the 
king 
to 
liberate 
him 
fromprisonorsavehimfromdeath. 


OFTHEWORSHIP 
OF 
IMAGES. 


Withregardto 
the 
worship 
of 
images, 
we 
shall 
also 
come 
to 
an 
understanding 
easily 
enough, 
if 
those 
excesses 
which 
even 
more 
moderate 
Catholics 
condemn 
in 
their 
fellows 
be 
moderated. 
In 
truth, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
images 
have 
no 
intrinsic 
virtues, 
and 
that 
therefore 
they 
are 
neither 
to 
be 
adored, 
nor 
ought 
men 
to 
pray 
before 
them, 
unless 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
be 
considered 
visible 
and 
striking 
methods 
of 
bringing 
to 
mind 
the 
recollection 
of 
Christ 
or 
heavenly 
things. 
That 
some 
Roman 
Catholics, 
chiefly 
in 
Italy, 
Bavaria, 
and 
the 
hereditary 
provinces 
of 
the 
Roman 
Emperor, 
do 
pay 
to 
images, 
especially 
those 
which 
are 
considered 
miraculous, 
a 
sinful 
worship, 
is 
too 
notorious 
to 
appear 
to 
admit 
of 
contradiction. 
Should 
any 
one, 
therefore, 
be 
anxious 
to 
worship 
or 
invoke 
God 
in 
presence 
of 
an 
image, 
let 
him 
observe 
the 
same 
moderation 
as 
did 
the 
Israelites 
of 
old, 
who 
contemplated 
the 
brazen 
serpent 
with 
a 
certain 
reverence, 
yet 
so 
as 
to 
make 
God, 
and 
not 
the 
image, 
the 
object 
of 
their 
faith. 
And 
let 
all 
such 
excess 
of 
ceremonies 
be 
avoided, 
as 
is 
calculated 
to 
suggest, 
if 
not 
to 
the 
learned 
and 
prudent, 
at 
least 
to 
the 
more 
simple 
people, 
an 
idolatrous 
idea, 
or 
one 
akin 
to 
idolatry, 
as 
though 
some 
divine 
virtueexistedinthe 
image. 


OFPURGATORY. 


I 
can 
discover 
nothing 
which 
can 
or 
should 
be 
said 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Protestants 
in 
congress 
on 
this 
subject. 
However, 
if 
the 
question 
be 
allowed, 
as 
St. 
Augustine 
treated 
it, 
to 
stand 
a 
problem 
in 
the 
schools, 
and 
if 
no 
one 
be 
obliged 
to 
adopt 
the 
affirmative 
or 
negative, 
I 
cannot 
perceive 
what 
injury 



should 
result 
to 
the 
Church. 
For 
my 
own 
part, 
I 
should 
have 
no 
objection 
to 
anyonewishingthisdoctrinetobereceived 
asa 
problem. 


OFTHEPRIMACYOFTHEPOPEASOFDIVINE 
RIGHT. 


That, 
after 
the 
preliminary 
reconciliation, 
the 
primacy 
may 
and 
can 
be 
allowed 
by 
Protestants 
to 
the 
Roman 
Pontiff, 
so 
far 
as 
he 
is 
entitled 
to 
it 
by 
the 
canons 
or 
of 
ecclesiastical 
right, 
we 
have 
shewn 
above. 
But 
whether 
the 
Pope 
be 
head 
of 
the 
Church 
by 
divine 
right, 
and, 
moreover, 
infallible, 
either 
in 
council 
or 
out 
of 
council, 
are 
questions 
of 
a 
higher 
range. 
Indeed, 
if 
the 
doctrine 
which 
the 
writer 
already 
quoted, 
Lewis 
Elias 
Dupin, 
Doctor 
of 
the 
Sorbonne, 
has 
most 
learnedly 
advanced 
in 
the 
fourth, 
fifth, 
sixth, 
and 
seventh 
dissertations 
of 
the 
work 
above 
cited, 
could 
meet 
the 
approval 
of 
ultramontane 
Catholics, 
as 
it 
does 
of 
Protestants, 
I 
should 
say 
that 
the 
whole 
affair 
was 
settled, 
or 
at 
least, 
that 
the 
Protestants 
fully 
agree 
with 
the 
French 
Church. 


OFTHEMONASTICSTATE 
AND 
VOWS. 


Concerning 
the 
monastic 
state 
and 
vows, 
in 
the 
proposed 
conference, 
it 
will 
be 
easy 
to 
come 
to 
an 
agreement, 
as 
there 
still 
remain 
monasteries 
among 
the 
Protestants, 
in 
which 
the 
canonical 
hours 
may 
be 
sung, 
and 
the 
Breviary 
read, 
just 
as 
is 
done, 
for 
instance, 
among 
the 
Cistercians, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
collects 
or 
little 
prayers 
addressed 
to 
deceased 
saints; 
and 
in 
which 
the 
fasts 
and 
distinction 
of 
meat 
can 
be 
observed, 
and 
celibacy, 
hospitality, 
the 
rule 
of 
St. 
Benedict, 
and 
other 
things 
savouring 
of 
the 
ancient 
institution, 
may 
be 
practised. 
Nor 
can 
any 
Protestant, 
with 
reason, 
condemn 
even 
the 
vow 
of 
obedience. 
As 
to 
the 
vow 
of 
poverty, 
whereby 
monks, 
who 
are 
entirely 
their 
own 
masters, 
renounce 
their 
property 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
right 
of 
any 
third 
person, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
such 
a 
matter 
is 
indifferent 
in 
itself, 
and 
therefore 



cannot 
be 
unlawful. 
The 
only 
question 
is 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
vow 
of 
chastity, 
inasmuch 
as 
no 
one 
can 
bind 
himself 
by 
vow 
to 
what 
is 
impossible. 
Celibacy 
may 
indeed 
(as 
it 
is 
faithfully 
practised 
in 
some 
Protestant 
monasteries) 
be 
promised, 
not 
by 
vow 
but 
by 
oath. 
That, 
however, 
must 
be 
in 
what 
is 
called 
a 
“composite 
sense 
so 
that, 
as 
long 
as 
one 
means 
to 
continue 
a 
monk 
or 
member 
of 
a 
monastery, 
he 
shall 
be 
bound 
to 
live 
in 
celibacy; 
but 
if 
he 
either 
cannot, 
or 
will 
not, 
do 
so, 
he 
may 
withdraw, 
should 
he 
think 
fit, 
and 
return 
to 
theworld 
athisown 
peril. 


OFTRADITION. 


Concerning 
traditions, 
or 
the 
unwritten 
word 
of 
God, 
how 
many 
contests 
have 
we 
not 
had 
in 
the 
Church! 
Yet 
it 
is, 
notwithstanding, 
a 
matter 
easily 
settled, 
provided 
we 
say 
that 
the 
controversy 
between 
us 
and 
the 
Catholics 
is, 
not 
whether 
there 
be 
traditions, 
but 
whether 
the 
Church 
has 
thence 
received 
any 
new 
article 
of 
faith 
necessary 
to 
be 
believed 
under 
pain 
of 
forfeiting 
eternal 
happiness, 
which 
article 
is 
not 
to 
be 
found 
in 
Scripture, 
either 
in 
so 
many 
words 
or 
by 
fair 
deduction. 
Protestants 
deny 
the 
latter, 
not 
the 
former; 
and 
the 
more 
moderate 
amongst 
them 
allow, 
not 
only 
that 
we 
owe 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures 
to 
tradition, 
but 
that 
the 
genuine 
and 
orthodox 
meaning 
of 
Scripture 
in 
the 
fundamental 
articles 
— 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
many 
other 
things 
enumerated 
by 
Calixtus, 
for 
instance, 
and 
Horneius, 
and 
Chemnitz, 
of 
our 
own 
religion 
— 
are 
only 
to 
be 
known 
from 
tradition. 
In 
sooth, 
those 
Protestants 
who, 
besides 
the 
Apostles’ 
creed 
and 
that 
of 
St. 
Athanasius, 
admit 
the 
first 
five 
general 
councils, 
together 
with 
the 
synods 
of 
Orange 
and 
Milevis, 
and 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
primitive 
Church, 
at 
least 
during 
the 
first 
five 
centuries, 
if 
not 
longer, 
as 
secondary 
principles 
in 
theology 
— 
in 
such 
sort 
that 
the 
fundamental 
articles 
are 
not 
to 
be 
explained 
otherwise 
than 
they 
were 
by 
the 
unanimous 
consent 
of 
the 
learned 
in 
those 
ages, 
— 
such 
Protestants 



will 
have 
very 
little 
matter 
of 
dispute 
with 
the 
Roman 
Church 
on 
the 
score 
of 
tradition. 


So 
much 
on 
these 
questions 
by 
way 
of 
specimen, 
in 
order 
that 
it 
may 
appear 
how 
easily 
many 
controversies 
might 
be 
adjusted 
by 
explanations 
or 
moderate 
views, 
provided 
neither 
party 
should 
make 
the 
opinion 
of 
his 
Church

point

or

Should 
any

remain

of

which, 
in 
this 
or 
any 
similar 
plan, 
may 
be 
laid 
down 
as 
necessary 
to 
be 
fulfilled 
andagreed 
upon;asforexample. 
i. 
The 
acceptance 
of 
the 
postulates 
by 
a 
laudable 
condescension 
[συγχαταβασιν] 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Sovereign 
Pontiff; 
in 
which 
consists 
the 
removal 
ofthesixmostimportantobstaclesby 
whichthepeaceoftheChurch 
has 
been 
hitherto 
impeded, 
and 
by 
which, 
unless 
they 
be 
removed 
in 
this 
or 
some 
similar 
way, 
it 
will 
be 
impeded 
to 
the 
end 
of 
time. 
ii. 
A 
previous 
congress, 
to 
be 
appointed 
by 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
a 
successful 
termination 
of 
its 
sessions. 
iii. 
The 
admission 
of 
Protestants 
into 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
Church, 
notwithstanding 
the 
difference 
which 
may 
still 
subsist 
respecting 
Communion 
under 
both 
kinds, 
and 
the 
questions 
which 
may 
be 

left 
to 
be 
determined 
in 
the 
future 
Council. 
iv. 
In 
the 
said 
Council 
every 
thing 
should 
be 
done 
according 
to 
the 
canons, 
and 
especially 
no 
one 
should 
be 
suffered 
to 
vote 
except 
a 
Bishop. 
Whence 
it 
is 
plain 
that, 
before 
its 
celebration 
and 
immediately 
after 
the 
preliminary 
union, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
perfect 
uniformity 
with 
the 
Romanists 
and 
full 
assurance 
of 
the 
reconciliation 
which 
has 
taken 
place, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
his 
Holiness 
should 
confirm, 
and 
recognise 
as 
true 
Bishops, 
all 
Protestant 
Superintendents, 
who 
shall 
be 
summoned, 
together 
with 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
Bishops, 
to 
this 
General 
Council, 
and 
shall 
sit 
and 
vote 
freely 
in 
the 
same, 
not 
as 
a 
party, 
but 
coordinatelywiththeRomanCatholic 
Bishops,ascompetentjudges. 


v. 
Such 
a 
Council 
should 
have 
for 
basis 
and 
rule 
the 
sacred 
canonical 
Scriptures 
of 
the 
Old 
and 
New 
Testament, 
the 
consensus 
of 
the 
ancient 
and 
primitive 
Church 
during 
at 
least 
the 
first 
five 
centuries, 
and 
also 
the 
consensus 
of 
the 
present 
patriarchal 
sees, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
circumstances 
of 
the 
times 
will 
allow 
its 
being 
ascertained. 
vi. 
In 
such 
a 
Council 
the 
disputation 
should 
be 
carried 
on 
by 
doctors, 
and 
the 
bishops 
should 
decide 
by 
plurality 
of 
votes; 
attending, 
however, 
beyond 
all 
things, 
to 
the 
excellent 
admonition 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
in 
his 
book 
Contra 
Epistolam 
Fundamenti, 
c. 
1: 
“Let 
every 
kind 
of 
arrogance 
be 
laid 
aside 
by 
both 
parties; 
let 
no 
one 
say 
he 
has 
already 
discovered 
the 
truth; 
let 
it 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
if 
it 
were 
unknown 
to 
both. 
For 
thus 
the 
inquiry 
shall 
be 
made 
with 
concord 
and 
diligence, 
if 
the 
truth 
be 
not, 
with 
rash 
presumption, 
believed 
to 
be 
discovered 
and 
known.” 
vii. 
After 
the 
close 
of 
the 
Council 
and 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
canons, 
both 
parties 
shall 
be 
bound 
to 
acquiesce 
in 
the 
decisions 
therein 
adopted: 
he 
who 
shalldootherwise, 
mustsuffer 
thepenalties 
adjudgedbythecanons. 
CONCLUSION. 



From 
these 
premises 
follows 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
proposition 
with 
which 
wecommenced, 
— 


If 
the 
Sovereign 
Pontiff 
be 
willing 
and 
able 
to 
grant 
to 
the 
Protestants 
these 
sixpreliminarypostulates: 


If, 
in 
the 
imperial 
Congress, 
the 
controversies 
of 
the 
first 
class, 
which 
regard 
themodeofspeech, 
bedecided: 


If 
in 
this 
Congress, 
in 
all 
controversies 
of 
the 
second 
class, 
each 
Church 
will 
embrace 
that 
doctrine 
which 
is 
held 
by 
a 
portion 
of 
its 
own 
members, 
and 
by 
allthemembersof 
theother: 


If 
questions 
of 
the 
third 
class 
can 
be 
brought 
to 
a 
close 
either 
by 
modifications 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
arbitrators, 
or 
by 
the 
decision 
of 
a 
general 
Council: 


It 
follows 
that 
a 
re-union 
of 
the 
Protestant 
and 
Catholic 
Churches 
is 
possible, 
withoutprejudicetotheprinciples, 
hypotheses,andreputationofeither. 


Now, 
from 
what 
we 
have 
already 
proved, 
the 
antecedent 
is 
true; 
Therefore

“Now 
the

and

that 
with

we

A.D.

THE 
question, 
“Whether 
a 
princess 
professing 
the 
Evangelical-Protestant 
religion 
can, 
with 
a 
safe 
conscience, 
in 
consideration 
of 
intermarriage 
with 
a 
Catholic 
king, 
embrace 
the 
Homan 
Catholic 
faith?” 
cannot 
be 
well 
and 
solidly 
resolved 
without 
first 
satisfactorily 
resolving 
the 
question, 
whether 
Roman 
Catholics 
are 
in 
error 
upon 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
faith 
and 
the 
essentials 
of 
salvation; 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
“whether 
the 
creed 
of 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
Church 
be 
so 
constituted 
as 
to 
render 
it 
possible 
to 
hold 
thereinthetruefaith 
andtoattainsalvation.” 


To 
the 
latter 
question 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
return 
a 
negative 
answer, 
and 
that 
forthreereasons. 


I. 
First, 
because 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
are 
agreed 
with 
us 
in 
the 
fundamental 
grounds 
of 
faith 
and 
practice, 
or 
hold 
the 
doctrines 
which 
are 
essentialtotheChristianprofession. 
For, 
in 
our 
view, 
the 
fundamental 
grounds 
of 
Christian 
faith 
and 
practice 
consist 
in 
the 
belief 
in 
God 
the 
Father 
who 
created 
us; 
in 
God 
the 
Son, 
the 



Saviour 
and 
promised 
Messiah, 
who 
has 
redeemed 
us 
from 
sin, 
death, 
the 
devil, 
and 
hell; 
and 
in 
the 
Holy 
Ghost, 
who 
enlightens 
and 
sanctifies 
us; 
in 
the 
Ten 
Commandments, 
which 
teach 
us 
our 
duty 
to 
God, 
to 
our 
neighbours, 
and 
to 
ourselves;inthe 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Lord’s 
Prayer, 
or 
Our 
Father, 
which 
teaches 
us 
how 
to 
pray; 
in 
the 
use 
of 
the 
Sacraments 
of 
holy 
Baptism 
and 
the 
Lord’s 
Supper, 
conformably 
to 
the 
institution 
and 
precept 
of 
Christ; 
to 
which 
is 
added 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Keys, 
which 
we 
believe 
to 
have 
been 
entrusted 
to 
the 
Apostles 
and 
their 
successors; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
we 
believe 
that 
power 
has 
been 
granted 
by 
Christ 
to 
the 
ministers 
of 
the 
Church 
to 
declare 
to 
the 
penitent 
the 
merciful 
remission 
of 
their 
sins, 
and 
to 
the 
impenitent 
the 
wrath 
and 
vengeance 
of 
God, 
and 
thus 
to 
loose 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
former, 
and 
to 
retain 
those 
of 
the 
latter; 
and, 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
institution, 
we 
occasionally 
approach 
the 
confessional 
and 
confess 
our 
sins, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
absolved 
therefrom. 


Whosoever 
believes 
and 
practises 
this, 
possesses 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
faith 
and 
of 
salvation, 
and 
thus 
may 
obtain 
eternalhappiness. 
Upon 
this 
foundation 
must 
the 
learned, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
unlearned, 
live 
and 
die, 
if 
he 
would 
be 
a 
ChristianandchildofGod,andanheir 
ofthekingdomof 
heaven. 


Now 
all 
this 
is 
found 
in 
the 
Lesser 
Catechism; 
for 
it 
is 
an 
abridgment 
of 
the 
Christian 
doctrine 
as 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
books 
of 
the 
prophets 
and 
apostles, 
and 
consists 
of 
six 
parts, 
viz. 
the 
Ten 
Commandments, 
the 
Creed, 
the 
Lord’s 
Prayer, 
the 
words 
of 
Christ 
our 
Lord 
on 
Baptism, 
on 
the 
holy 
Supper 
of 
our 
Lord 
Jesus 
Christ, 
and 
on 
the 
calling 
and 
office 
of 
the 
keys. 
Now 
this 
Catechism, 
or 
abridgment 
of 
Christian 
doctrine, 
is 
not 
confined 
to 
us 
Protestants 
alone: 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
have 
it 
also, 
and 
in 
common 
with 
us; 
and 
if 
they 
wish 
to 
instruct 
any 
one 
in 
Christian 
faith 
and 
practice, 
they 
impress 
upon 
him 
these 
very 
articles, 
and 
teach 
him, 
in 
precisely 
the 
same 
way, 
what 
he 
must 
believe 
and 
practise, 
if 
he 
would 
be 
a 
Christian 
and 
attain 



to 
salvation; 
as 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
Roman 
Catechism, 
and 
in 
those 
of 
Canisius, 
Volusius, 
and 
others, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
recent 
reprint 
of 
the 
HildesheimCatechism. 


Whence 
it 
is 
that 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
Confession 
of 
Augsburg 
declare 
in 
their 
preface, 
that 
“all 
Roman 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants 
live 
and 
strive 
under 
one 
Christ;” 
and 
in 
the 
end 
of 
the 
twenty-first 
article, 
that 
“our 
(the 
Protestant) 
doctrine 
(as 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
works 
of 
the 
Fathers) 
is 
not 
opposed 
to 
the 
common 
faith 
of 
the 
Christian 
Church, 
nay, 
even 
of 
the 
Roman 
Church.” 
The 
Apology 
for 
the 
Confession, 
in 
the 
article 
on 
justification, 
says, 
that 
it 
should 
not 
readily 
be 
believed 
that 
the 
Roman 
Church 
holds 
every 
thing 
that 
the 
Pope, 
Cardinals, 
Bishops, 
or 
individual 
theologians 
and 
monks 
have 
held, 
maintained, 
and 
taught; 
“that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
Christ 
has, 
at 
all 
times, 
been 
preserved 
by 
some 
pious 
persons 
in 
the 
Roman 
Church 
that 
“we 
do 
not 
accuse 
all 
(Roman 
Catholics), 
for 
we 
hold 
that 
there 
have 
always 
been 
in 
the 
monasteries 
pious 
and 
upright 
individuals, 
who 
have 
kept 
aloof 
from 
the 
traditions 
of 
men, 
and 
refused 
to 
assent 
to 
the 
creed 
of 
the 
hypocrites 
who 
were 
among 
their 
number.” 
Luther, 
too, 
confesses 
“that 
there 
is 
under 
the 
papacy 
much 
Christian 
goodness, 
yea, 
all 
Christian 
goodness.” 
He 
has 
a 
similar 
admission 
also 
in 
the 
sixth 
volume; 
and 
in 
the 
seventh 
he 
declares 
that 
he 
“holds 
as 
dear 
brethren 
and 
members 
of 
the 
Christian 
Church, 
all 
those 
who 
confess 
with 
him 
(as 
do 
the 
Roman 
Catholics) 
that 
Christ 
was 
sent 
by 
the 
Father, 
that 
He 
has 
reconciled 
us 
to 
Him 
by 
His 
death, 
and 
has 
purchased 
salvation 
for 
us.” 
And 
Philip 
Melancthon 
confesses, 
that 
“those 
who 
hold 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
faith 
have 
been, 
are, 
and 
will 
be, 
the 
Church 
of 
God, 
although 
some 
of 
them 
may 
have 
had 
more,and 
others, 
less,light.” 


II. 
Secondly, 
because 
under 
the 
papacy 
there 
has 
been 
a 
true 
Church; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
certain 
assembly 
of 
men 
who 
hear 
the 
word 
of 
God 
and 
use 
the 

sacraments 
established 
by 
Christ. 
For 
if 
there 
were 
not, 
or 
had 
not 
been, 
under 
the 
papacy, 
a 
true 
Church, 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
all 
who 
are, 
or 
at 
any 
time 
have 
been 
attached 
to 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
Church, 
must 
be 
hopelessly 
damned; 
a 
conclusion 
which 
none 
of 
our 
divines 
has 
ever 
advanced 
in 
speaking 
or 
in 
writing. 
Nay 
further, 
Luther 
argues, 
from 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
the 
true 
Church 
did 
subsist 
under 
the 
papacy, 
that 
the 
Pope 
is 
Antichrist 
— 
a 
position 
which 
is 
nevertheless 
highly 
questionable; 
— 
writing 
in 
his 
Commentary 
on 
the 
Epistle 
to 
the 
Galatians, 
that 
where 
the 
essentials 
of 
the 
word 
of 
God 
and 
the 
sacraments 
dwell, 
there 
is 
a 
holy 
Church, 
even 
though 
Antichristshouldruletherein. 


So 
also 
in 
the 
Epitome 
Examinis 
Philipp. 
Melancthonis, 
the 
question 
“Whether 
there 
was 
a 
true 
Church 
under 
the 
papacy?” 
is 
answered, 
“Yes, 
most 
assuredly. 
For 
it 
is 
notorious, 
that 
under 
the 
papal 
rule 
there 
still 
were 
preserved 
the 
word 
of 
God 
and 
the 
articles 
derived 
therefrom, 
— 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Catechism: 
viz. 
the 
Ten 
Commandments, 
the 
Apostles’ 
Creed, 
the 
Lord’s 
Prayer, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Baptism, 
the 
portions 
of

and 
epistles 
for 
Sundays, 
from 
which 
the 
elect 
learned 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
Christian 
truth, 
and 
either 
despised 
human 
traditions,

were 
struck

The 
author 
of 
this 
Epitome 
is 
John 
Säubert, 
formerly 
chief 
preacher 
at 
Nürnberg, 
and

It

III. 
Thirdly, 
because 
the 
Roman 
Catholics, 
as 
well 
as 
we, 
believe 
and 
confess, 
both 
with 
the 
heart 
and 
with 
the 
lips, 
in 
their 
public 
writings 
and 
their 
teaching 
from 
the 
pulpit, 
that 
in 
no 
other 
is 
there 
salvation, 
no 
other 
name 
is 
there 
given 
to 
men, 
whereby 
they 
may 
be 
saved, 
but 
the 
name 
of 

Jesus; 
and 
that 
man 
is 
justified 
in 
God’s 
sight, 
not 
by 
the 
works 
of 
the 
law, 
nor 
by 
the 
merit 
of 
works, 
but 
by 
the 
grace 
and 
mercy 
of 
God, 
and 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
our 
Lord 
and 
Saviour 
Jesus 
Christ, 
of 
whom 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
(as 
the 
late 
pious 
and 
upright 
Abbot 
of 
Gytzburg 
writes 
in 
the 
preface 
of 
his 
Compendium 
Regulae 
Fidei 
Catholicae) 
teaches, 
and 
has 
always 
taught, 
that, 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
world, 
no 
one 
has 
been, 
or 
can 
be, 
saved, 
but 
through 
Jesus 
Christ, 
the 
only 
Mediator 
between 
God 
and 
men; 
and 
that 
no 
other 
name 
under 
heaven 
has 
been 
given 
to 
men 
whereby 
they 
can 
be 
saved. 
And 
on 
the 
feast 
of 
the 
Nativity 
of 
our 
Lord 
the 
entire 
Church 
sings 
— 


“Thisever-blestrecurring 
day 
Its 
witnessbears, 
that 
all 
alone, 
FromThy 
ownFather’s 
bosom,forth, 
Tosavetheworld, 
Thou 
earnest 
down.” 


The 
Council 
of 
Trent 
calls 
Him 
“our 
only 
Redeemer 
and 
Saviour;” 
and, 
in 
another 
place, 
declares 
that 
God 
has 
appointed 
Him 
the 
“Propitiator, 
through 
faith 
in 
His 
Blood, 
for 
our 
sins; 
and 
not 
only 
for 
ours, 
but 
for 
those 
of 
the 
whole 
world” 
(Sess. 
vi. 
ch. 
2, 
On 
Justification). 
And 
again, 
“if 
men 
born 
of 
Adam 
benotbornagaininChrist,they 
nevercanobtain 
justification;because 
this 
regeneration 
is 
gratuitously 
imparted 
to 
them 
through 
the 
merits 
of 
His 
Passion, 
whereby 
they 
are 
justified: 
for 
which 
benefit 
the 
Apostle 
directs 
us 
always 
to 
give 
thanks 
to 
God 
the 
Father, 
who 
has 
made 
us 
capable 
of 
the 
inheritance 
of 
the 
saints 
in 
light, 
and 
rescued 
us 
from 
the 
power 
of 
darkness, 
and 
established 
us 
in 
the 
kingdom 
of 
His 
beloved 
Son, 
in 
whom 
we 
have 
redemptionandtheforgivenessof 
sins.” 


The 
Christian 
Assembly 
of 
Trier, 
moreover, 
teaches 
that 
the 
“beginning 
of 
justification 
in 
adults 
flows 
by 
a 
purely 
gratuitous 
mercy 
from 
God 
in 
Christ 
that 
is 
“from 
his 
vocation, 
whereby 
they 
are 
called 
without 
consideration 
of 



any 
merit 
of 
their 
own; 
that 
“none 
of 
those 
things 
which 
precede 
justification, 
whether 
faith 
or 
works, 
merits 
the 
grace 
of 
justification;” 
and 
that 
“we 
must 
hold, 
as 
of 
faith, 
that 
sin 
neither 
is 
forgiven, 
nor 
was 
ever 
forgiven, 
except 
throughthegratuitousmercyof 
GodandforChrist’s 
sake.” 


Our 
own 
Doctors 
also, 
as 
Flavius, 
Hunnius, 
J. 
Gerhard, 
G. 
Calixtus, 
and 
many 
others, 
are 
compelled 
to 
admit 
that 
in 
the 
book 
entitled 
Hortulus 
Animae, 
and 
in 
theRituals 
of 
Maintz, 
Trier,Cologne, 
and 
otherChurches, 
the 
dyingChristian 
is 
exhorted 
andsustained, 
not 
by 
the 
consideration 
of 
hisown 
merits, 
nor 
of 
any 
other 
false 
means 
of 
salvation, 
but 
solely 
by 
trust 
in 
Christ, 
partly 
through 
prayers 
and 
instructions, 
partly 
through 
special 
questions 
addressed 
to 
this 
end. 
I 
shall 
give 
but 
a 
single 
example 
from 
the 
Ritual 
of 
Maintz, 
printed 
in 
1599. 
In 
this 
ritual 
there 
is 
an 
instruction 
for 
the 
dying, 
and 
for 
those 
who 
have 
received 
Extreme 
Unction, 
in 
which, 
among 
other 
things, 
it 
is 
said, 
“Thy 
own 
merits, 
nay, 
even 
the 
merits 
of 
the 
whole 
human 
race, 
are 
insufficient 
to 
form 
a 
title 
to 
eternal 
happiness; 
and 
since 
our 
own 
works 
and 
our 
own 
merits 
are 
inadequate, 
we 
must 
throw 
ourselves 
upon 
the 
merits 
of 
Christ 
our 
common 
Saviour, 
whom 
God, 
out 
of 
His 
divine 
charity, 
has 
given 
to 
the 
world. 
On 
this 
gracious 
and 
merciful 
God 
must 
thou 
place 
thy 
reliance; 
be 
of 
good 
heart 
and 
fear 
not, 
but 
keep 
a 
firm 
hope 
and 
undoubting 
confidence.” 
And, 
after 
the 
Unction 
has 
been 
received, 
“If 
thou 
wilt 
place 
thy 
trust 
in 
the 
good 
God, 
who 
is 
merciful 
and 
full 
of 
clemency, 
and 
in 
His 
grace, 
and 
wilt 
strive 
and 
fight 
bravely 
against 
all 
the 
assaults 
of 
sin 
and 
the 
devil, 
and 
wilt 
discard 
all 
temptation 
of 
doubt, 
the 
Almighty 
God 
will 
easily 
hide 
thy 
sins 
in 
the 
many 
and 
precious 
merits 
of 
Jesus 
Christ; 
in 
Him, 
thy 
Saviour, 
thou 
shaltbe 
delivered 
fromsin 
and 
damnation, 
and 
thy 
soulshall 
be 
securely 
established 
in 
happiness.” 
And 
in 
the 
Hildesheim 
Catechism, 
the 
sick 
and 
dying 
man 
says 
in 
his 
prayer, 
“Even 
though 
I 
were 
to 
lead 
a 
better 
life 
for 
the 
future, 
yet 
if 
Thou, 
O 
Lord, 
hast 
ordained 
that 
I 
am 
to 
die 
now, 
I 
prefer 
rather 



to 
die 
now, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Thy 
holy 
will, 
and 
forego 
all 
the 
good 
works, 
than 
live 
longer.” 
Amongthe 
questions, 
too, 
which 
are 
addressed 
tothe 
dying 
man, 
are 
the 
following: 
“Dost 
thou 
desire 
that 
our 
Lord 
should 
shew 
thee 
mercy, 
and 
not 
justice; 
and 
that, 
above 
all 
things, 
He 
should 
deal 
with 
thee, 
not 
according 
to 
thy 
merits, 
but 
according 
to 
His 
own 
infinite 
justice?” 
Answer: 
“Yes,” 
“Dost 
thou 
believe 
that 
for 
thee 
there 
is 
no 
hope 
of 
happiness, 
save 
through 
His 
holy, 
precious, 
and 
bitter 
death 
alone?” 
Answer: 
“Yes.” 


Hence, 
having 
now 
shewn 
that 
the 
fundamentals 
of 
faith 
exist 
in 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
Church, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
within 
its 
pale 
to 
maintain 
the 
true 
Faith, 
to 
lead 
a 
Christian 
life, 
and 
to 
die 
happily, 
we 
are 
enabled 
with 
propriety 
to 
reply 
in 
the 
affirmative 
to 
the 
main 
question, 
“Whether 
an 
Evangelical-Protestant 
princess, 
in 
consideration 
of 
intermarriage 
with 
a 
Catholic 
king, 
may 
with 
a 
safe 
conscience 
embrace 
the 
Catholic 
religion?” 
She 
maydoso:especiallywhenit 
isconsidered: 


(1.) 
That 
she 
neither 
herself 
sought 
this 
alliance, 
nor 
caused 
it 
to 
be 
sought 
on 
her 
behalf, 
butthatithas 
unquestionably 
been 
offered 
to 
herin 
thedesigns 
ofGod’sholyprovidence. 


(2.) 
That 
the 
alliance 
may 
be 
beneficial 
and 
salutary, 
not 
alone 
to 
her 
native 
duchy, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
Protestant 
religion, 
and 
perhaps 
to 
the 
project 
of 
Churchunionsolongand 
anxiously 
desired. 


It 
must 
be 
stipulated, 
however, 
that 
she 
shall 
not 
be 
required 
to 
abjure 
her 
former 
religion, 
and 
that 
no 
wide 
range 
of 
controversies 
or 
disputes 
shall 
be 
proposed 
to 
her 
as 
articles 
of 
faith; 
but 
that 
she 
shall 
be 
instructed 
with 
all 
possible 
brevity 
and 
simplicity, 
and 
most 
especially 
in 
those 
principles 
which 
are 
of 
indispensable 
necessity 
and 
connected 
with 
salvation 
— 
viz. 
renunciation 
of 
self, 
daily 
repentance, 
humility 
towards 
God, 
condescension 
and 
tenderness 
for 
the 
poor, 
imitation 
of 
the 
example 
of 
Christ, 
and 
the 
love 



of 
God 
and 
of 
her 
neighbour. 
Regarding 
which 
the 
pious 
J. 
Streder, 
in 
the 
first 
book 
of 
his 
True 
Christianity, 
writes 
with 
great 
discernment 
“That 
purity 
of 
doctrine, 
and 
the 
light 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God, 
never 
dwells 
with 
those 
wholiveinthedevil, 
indarkness,pride,avarice,andsensuality.” 


“For 
how,” 
he 
asks, 
“could 
pure 
and 
divine 
faith 
subsist 
where 
the 
manner 
of 
life 
is 
so 
impure 
and 
ungodly? 
Purity 
of 
doctrine 
and 
impurity 
of 
life 
never 
can 
be 
associated 
together, 
and 
have 
no 
community 
with 
each 
other; 
and, 
if 
we 
would 
maintain 
purity 
of 
faith, 
we 
must 
change 
our 
habits, 
abandon 
the 
unchristian 
life, 
follow 
the 
Lord 
Christ, 
and 
awake 
from 
sin. 
So 
will 
Christ 
enlighten 
us 
with 
the 
light 
of 
true 
faith. 
Wherefore, 
he 
who 
walketh 
not 
in 
Christ’s 
footsteps, 
in 
His 
love, 
in 
humility, 
meekness, 
patience, 
and 
the 
fear 
of 
God, 
must 
necessarily 
be 
led 
astray. 
If 
we 
but 
lived 
in 
Christ, 
if 
we 
walked 
in 
charity 
and 
humility, 
and 
directed 
all 
our 
diligence 
and 
all 
our 
theological 
lore 
to 
the 
learning 
how 
we 
shall 
mortify 
the 
flesh 
and 
live 
in 
Christ, 
how 
Adam 
shall 
die 
and 
Christ 
live 
in 
us, 
how 
we 
shall 
subdue 
ourselves 
and 
the 
demon 
of 
the 
flesh, 
and 
overcome 
the 
world, 
there 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
so 
many 
angry 
controversies 
regarding 
faith, 
and 
all 
heresies 
would 
fall 
to 
the 
groundof 
theirownaccord.” 


And 
this 
doctrine 
certainly 
accords 
with 
that 
of 
Thomas 
à 
Kempis, 
of 
Taulerus, 
of 
Ruspröck, 
of 
the 
author 
of 
the 
German 
Theology, 
and 
other 
piousanddivinelyenlightened 
menamongtheRomanCatholics. 


However, 
against 
the 
answer 
which 
we 
have 
given, 
various 
objections 
maybe 
proposedandurged. 
For 
example,thefollowing: 


FIRSTOBJECTION. 


“The 
Roman 
Catholic 
doctrine 
contains 
errors 
subversive 
of 
the 
foundations 
offaith.” 



ANSWER. 


Yes, 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
those 
who 
believe 
them 
to 
be 
such, 
and 
subscribe 
to 
them 
against 
the 
dictates 
of 
conscience. 
But 
we 
hold 
with 
Hust, 
that 
every 
erroris 
notheretical. 


SECONDOBJECTION. 


“Theyreceivehuman 
traditions,andrequirethepeopleto 
admitthem.” 


ANSWER. 


They 
teach 
that 
divine 
apostolic 
traditions, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
doctrines 
which 
are 
not 
contained 
in 
Scripture, 
but 
which 
Christ 
propounded 
to 
the 
Apostles, 
are 
to 
be 
received 
with 
the 
same 
respect 
as 
the 
written 
word 
of 
God. 
And 
we 
ourselves 
admit 
the 
same; 
so 
that 
there 
only 
remains 
the 
question, 
whether 
this 
or 
that 
particular 
doctrine 
is 
a 
divine 
or 
apostolic 
tradition. 
But 
on 
the 
subjectof 
humantraditions,they 
teachnothing 
butwhat 
we 
ourselveshold. 


THIRDOBJECTION. 


“They 
require 
the 
invocation 
of 
the 
Saints, 
whereas 
God 
alone 
is 
to 
be 
invoked.” 


ANSWER. 


In 
the 
Council 
of 
Trent 
there 
is 
not 
a 
word 
which 
implies 
obligation; 
but 
simply 
a 
declaration 
that 
“it 
is 
good 
and 
useful.” 
And 
hence 
no 
individual 
Roman 
Catholic 
is 
bound 
to 
invoke 
the 
saints, 
unless 
he 
attends 
a 
procession, 
or 
takes 
a 
part 
in 
the 
public 
church 
in 
the 
litany 
of 
the 
Saints. 
And 
these 
invocations 
do 
not 
imply 
any 
thing 
more 
than 
a 
prayer 
for 
their 
intercession 



on 
our 
behalf 
— 
a 
practice 
received 
by 
both 
the 
Greek 
and 
the 
Latin 
Churches 
for 
fourteen 
hundred 
years, 
without 
being 
thought 
to 
trench 
upon 
thehonourduetoGod. 


FOURTHOBJECTION. 


“They 
enjoin 
a 
belief 
in 
purgatory, 
which 
is 
entirely 
without 
warrant 
in 
the 
wordofGod.” 


ANSWER. 


In 
so 
far 
as 
purgatory 
signifies 
a 
purgation 
of 
departed 
souls 
from 
the 
sins 
which 
stillclingto 
them,manyoftheancientdoctorsof 
theChurch 
haveheld 
that 
doctrine. 


FIFTHOBJECTION. 


“The 
celebration 
of 
the 
Mass, 
from 
the 
multiplication 
of 
strange 
ceremonies, 
hasbecome 
ridiculous 
andoffensive.” 


ANSWER. 


To 
those 
who 
do 
not 
understand 
the 
signification 
of 
those 
rites 
and 
ceremonies; 
but 
there 
is 
not 
one 
of 
them 
which 
has 
not 
a 
good 
signification. 
Onthis 
subject, 
the 
Hildesheim 
Catechism, 
as 
well 
as 
many 
other 
works, 
may 
be 
consulted. 
Besides,the 
Mass, 
accordingto 
their 
view, 
is 
acommemoration 
ofthebitterPassionandDeathofJesusChrist. 


SIXTHOBJECTION. 


“Theydeprivethelaity 
oftheconsecratedchalice.” 



ANSWER. 


Just 
as 
man’s 
unbelief 
does 
not 
destroy 
the 
faith 
and 
promise 
of 
God, 
so 
neither 
can 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
the 
consecrated 
chalice 
from 
the 
laity, 
in 
which 
they 
have 
themselves 
no 
share, 
be 
imputed 
to 
them; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
we 
must 
hold 
that 
if 
they 
approach 
the 
Holy 
Supper 
withpenitent 
and 
believing 
hearts, 
theyreceivetheBodyandBlood 
ofChrist 
noless 
thanourselves. 


SEVENTHOBJECTION. 


“It 
is 
required 
that 
one 
should 
believe 
in 
seven 
Sacraments, 
whereas 
there 
are 
buttwo.” 


ANSWER. 


According 
to 
the 
acceptation 
of 
the 
word 
“Sacrament” 
(which 
it 
should 
be 
remembered 
is 
not 
found 
in 
Holy 
Scripture), 
there 
are 
numbered 
in 
the 
Apology 
of 
the 
Confession 
of 
Augsburg, 
in 
one 
place 
two, 
and 
in 
another 
three; 
that 
is, 
if 
absolution 
be 
reckoned 
in 
the 
number. 
And, 
at 
all 
events, 
the 
Roman 
Catholics 
themselves 
allow 
that 
Baptism 
and 
the 
Lord’s 
Supper 
are 
thetwo 
mostexcellentand 
principal. 


Should 
any 
other 
objections 
be 
proposed, 
we 
are 
prepared, 
with 
all 
due 
respect, 
to 
reply 
to 
them 
either 
verbally 
or 
in 
writing, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
supply 
any 
such 
further 
explanations 
of 
the 
above, 
as 
may 
chance 
to 
be 
desired. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
must 
be 
confessed, 
that 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
controversies 
between 
us 
and 
Roman 
Catholics 
is 
but 
ill 
adapted 
for 
a 
princess, 
whose 
duty 
it 
is 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
simple 
principles 
of 
faith, 
which 
are 
also 
the 
best; 
and 
that 
it 
belongs 
rather 
to 
theologians, 
among 
whom 
there 
have 
been 
found 
severalon 
both 
sides, 
whose 
eyes 
God, 
in 
His 
saving 
grace,has 
openedto 
see 



that 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
religions 
is 
not 
so 
great 
as 
it 
is 
commonly 
represented. 
And 
it 
is 
well 
worthy 
of 
observation 
that 
the 
upright 
and 
learned 
Philip 
Melancthon, 
in 
his 
Judicium 
de 
Moderandis 
Controversiis, 
addressed 
to 
King 
Francis 
in 
the 
sixth 
year 
after 
publication 
of 
the 
Confession 
of 
Augsburg, 
admits 
that 
it 
is 
so. 
“Finally,” 
says 
he, 
“the 
adjustment 
of 
all 
controversies 
between 
the 
Papists 
and 
us 
is 
easy; 
and 
I 
hope 
that 
all 
pious 
and 
God-fearingheartsmaybeabletoagree 
inthemall.” 


Pray 
God 
that 
it 
be 
so; 
and 
that 
the 
present 
work 
tend 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
His 
Name, 
and 
to 
the 
temporal 
and 
eternal 
welfare 
of 
both 
the 
high 
personages 
and 
their 
royal 
and 
princely 
houses, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
Christ 
our 
common 
Saviour. 
Amen.

J’ai

quand 
j’étais 
à

il 
avait 
aussi 
la 
bonté 
de 
faire 
quelque 
estime 
de

et 
quand 
je 
partis 
de 
Paris 
pour 
me 
rendre 
à 
Hanovre, 
il 
me 
donna 
une 
lettre 
pour 
un 
Capucin 
d’ici, 
qui 
lui 
avait 
demandé 
quelque 
chose 
touchant 
la 
créance 
des 
Grecs 
en 
matière 
de 
Transsubstantiation, 
où 
il 
avait 
mis 
à 
mon 
louange 
des 
expressions 
qui 
m’auraient 
empêché 
de 
porter 
ces

si 
je 
les 
avais 
lues;

jene 
l’appris 
qu’àHanovreque

pour 
être 
véritablement

des

de

Mais 
comme 
je 
n’ai 
jamais 
affecté 
une 
grande 
réputation, 
et 
que 
j’ai 
plutôttâché 
de

(comme 
lorsque

Prince), 
il 
n’a 
aussi 
jamais 
tenu 
à 
moi 
d’être 
du 
côté 
de 
la 
vérité. 
Et 
ce 
qui 
m’avait 
le 
plus 
détourné 
des 
sentimens 
de 
l’Eglise 
Romaine, 
c’était 
(car 
à 
présent 
je 
ne 
parle 
pas 
de 
la 
pratique) 
principalement 
les 
difficultés 
qui 
se 
trouvaient 
dans 
la 
Transsubstantiation, 
et 
les 
démonstrations 
que 
je 
crois 
d’avoir 
sur 
les 
matières 
approchantes 
de 
la 
grâce, 
j’ai 
toujours 
tâché 
de 
me 
satisfaire, 
et 
peu 
s’en 
faut, 
que 
je 
n’aie 
pas 
réussi 
entièrement. 
Mais 
ces

des 
méditations 
exactes 
sur 
la 
partie 
la 
plus 
profonde 
des 
métaphysiques, 
la 
facilité, 
qu’il 
y 
a 
de 
se 
tromper 
là 
dessus, 
avant 
que 
d’avoir 
rangé 
ses 
raisonnements 
d’une 
manière 
rigoureuse 
à 
la 
façon 
d’un 
calcul, 
m’en 
empêche 
de 
former 
un 
jugement 
définitif. 
Monsieur 
Arnaud, 
qui 
entend 
parfaitement 
la 
philosophie 
moderne, 
et 
qui 
parait 
Cartésien, 
n’a 
jamais 
osé 
toucher 
cette 
corde, 
ou 
répondre 
aux 
difficultés 
presqu’invincibles 
qui 
semblent 
combattre 
la 
Transsubstantiation; 
peut-être 
parce-qu’il 
croyait 
que 
son 
explication 
serait 
condamnée 
quand 
elle 
paroîtrait. 
De 
sorte 
que 
voici 
comme 
je 
crois 
qu’il 
faudrait 
faire 
pour 
aller 
sûrement 
en 
ces 
matières: 
savoir, 
il 
faudrait 
qu’un 
homme 
méditatif 
qui 
n 
est 
pas 
éloigné 
de 
la 
réunion, 
composât 
une 
Exposition 
de 
la 
Foi, 
un 
peu 
plus 
particularisée 
que 
celle 
de 



Monsieur 
de 
Condom, 
où 
il 
tâcherait 
de 
s’expliquer, 
le 
plus 
exactement 
et 
le 
plus 
sincèrement 
possibles, 
sur 
les 
articles 
disputés, 
évitant 
les 
équivoques 
et 
les 
termes 
de 
la 
chicane 
scolastique, 
et 
ne 
parlant 
que 
par 
des 
expressions 
naturelles. 
Et 
il 
soumettrait 
cette 
explication 
au 
jugement 
de 
quelques 
savans 
évêques 
des 
plus 
modérés 
(du 
parti 
de 
l’Eglise 
Romaine), 
dissimulant 
et 
son 
nom 
et 
son 
parti. 
Et 
pour 
les 
faire 
juger 
d’autant 
plus 
favorablement, 
il 
ne 
demanderait 
point 
s’ils 
sont 
de 
son 
sentiment, 
mais 
seulement 
s’ils 
tiennent 
sonsentimentpourtolérabledansleurEglise. 


V. 
A. 
S. 
me 
dira 
qu’il 
ne 
faut 
pas 
tant 
de 
façons, 
et 
on 
peut 
être 
de 
la 
communion 
de 
Rome 
sans 
entrer 
dans 
ce 
détail. 
Je 
réponds 
distinguendo: 
une 
personne 
qui 
n’a 
pas 
approfondi 
ces 
matières, 
et 
n’a 
pas 
dessein 
de 
les 
approfondir, 
est 
aisée 
à 
satisfaire. 
Mais 
celui 
qui 
a 
médité 
sur 
les 
choses 
doit 
aller 
sincere-merit, 
et 
s’il 
soupçonne 
que 
certains 
de 
ses 
sentimens 
pourraient 
être 
condamnés, 
il 
se 
doit 
expliquer 
de 
bonne 
heure. 
Autrement 
il 
se 
pourrait 
exposer 
à 
des 
conjonctures 
fâcheuses, 
si 
quelque 
jour 
on 
le 
voulait 
faire 
avouer 
des 
choses 
qu’il 
ne 
saurait 
approuver. 
Ce 
qu’il 
arriva 
à

ne

de 
cette 
nature 
que

pour

il

celui

l’expression 
de

trouve

Je 
crois

que 
l’approbation 
des 
évêques 
suffirait, 
et 
que 
celle 
de

ne 
serait 
point 
si 
nécessaire. 
Peut-être 
pourtant 
qu’on 
le 
pourrait 
espérer, 
si 
on 
s’y 
prenait 
comme

et 
je 
sais 
qu’il 
y 
a 
des

Discourse 
on 
Metaphysics 
(1686) 



Original 
Title: 
‘Discours 
de 
métaphysique’ 


Translated 
by 
George 
Redington 
Montgomery, 
1908 


This 
short 
treatise 
develops 
a 
philosophy 
concerning 
physical 
substance, 
motion 
and 
resistance 
of 
bodies, 
while 
examining 
God’s 
role 
within 
the 
universe. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
few 
texts 
presenting 
in 
a 
consistent 
form 
the 
earlier 
philosophy 
of 
Leibniz. 
The 
treatise 
is 
closely 
connected 
to 
the 
epistolary 
discussion 
that 
Leibniz 
conducted 
with 
Antoine 
Arnauld. 
However, 
he 
refrained 
from 
releasing 
the 
full 
text 
and 
it 
remained 
unpublished 
until 
the 
mid-nineteenth 
century. 
Arnauld 
received 
only 
an 
abridged 
version 
in 
37 
points 
whichresumedwhole 
paragraphsandsteeredtheirdiscussion. 


In 
the 
text, 
Leibniz 
explains 
that 
metaphysical 
considerations 
proceed 
from 
God 
to 
the 
substantial 
world 
and 
back 
to 
the 
spiritual 
realm. 
The 
starting 
point 
for 
the 
work 
is 
the 
conception 
of 
God 
as 
an 
absolutely 
perfect 
being 
(I), 
that 
God 
is 
good 
but 
goodness 
exists 
independently 
of 
God 
(a 
rejection 
of 
divine 
command 
theory) 
(II), 
and 
that 
God 
has 
created 
the 
world 
inan 
ordered 
andperfectfashion(III–VII). 


Discourse 
on 
Metaphysics 
proposes 
the 
controversial 
claim, 
“That 
the 
opinions 
of... 
scholastic 
philosophers 
are 
not 
to 
be 
wholly 
despised 
(XI).” 
In 
the 
early 
days 
of 
modern 
philosophy 
in 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
philosophers 
were 
expected 
to 
reject 
many 
of 
the 
precepts 
of 
medieval 
philosophy. 
Leibniz 
saw 
the 
failures 
of 
scholasticism 
merely 
as 
one 
of 
rigor. 
He 
argued 
that 
if 
some 
careful 
and 
meditative 
thinker 
was 
to 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
clarify 
and 
direct 
their 
thoughts 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
analytic 
geometers, 
he 
would 
derive 
a 
greattreasure 
ofimportanttruths,whollydemonstrable. 



Leibniz 
also 
claims 
that 
God’s 
omnipotence 
is 
in 
no 
way 
impugned 
by 
the 
thought 
of 
evil, 
but 
was 
rather 
solidified. 
He 
endorses 
the 
view 
that 
God 
chooses 
the 
best 
of 
all 
possible 
worlds. 
Thus, 
Leibniz 
suggests 
that 
this 
world 
is 
the 
best 
there 
possibly 
could 
be 
— 
taking 
all 
facts 
into 
account, 
no 
better 
world 
could 
be 
imagined, 
even 
if 
we 
believed 
that 
we 
could 
think 
of 
something 
more 
perfect. 
Leibniz’ 
groundbreaking 
conception 
of 
physical 
substancewould

I. 
Concerning 
the 
divine 
perfectionand 
that 
God 
does 
everything 
in 
the 
most 
desirable 
way. 
THE 
CONCEPTION 
OF 
God 
which 
is 
the 
most 
common 
and 
the 
most 
full 
of 
meaning 
is 
expressed 
well 
enough 
in 
the 
words: 
God 
is 
an 
absolutely 
perfect 
being. 
The 
implications, 
however, 
of 
these 
words 
fail 
to 
receive 
sufficient 
consideration. 
For 
instance, 
there 
are 
many 
different 
kinds 
of 
perfection, 
all 
of 
which 
God 
possesses, 
and 
each 
one 
of 
them 
pertains 
to 
him 
in 
the 
highest 
degree. 


We 
must 
also 
know 
what 
perfection 
is. 
One 
thing 
which 
can 
surely 
be 
affirmed 
about 
it 
is 
that 
those 
forms 
or 
natures 
which 
are 
not 
susceptible 
of 
it 
to 
the 
highest 
degree, 
say 
the 
nature 
of 
numbers 
or 
of 
figures, 
do 
not 
permit 
of 
perfection. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
number 
which 
is 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
(that 
is, 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
the 
numbers), 
and 
likewise 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
figures, 
imply 
contradictions. 
The 
greatest 
knowledge, 
however, 
and 
omnipotence 
contain 
no 
impossibility. 
Consequently 
power 
and 
knowledge 
do 
admit 
of 
perfection, 
and 
inso 
farastheypertainto 
Godthey 
havenolimits. 


Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
God 
who 
possesses 
supreme 
and 
infinite 
wisdom 
acts 
in 
the 
most 
perfect 
manner 
not 
only 
metaphysically, 
but 
also 
from 
the 
moral 
standpoint. 
And 
with 
respect 
to 
ourselves 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
the 
more 
we 
are 
enlightened 
and 
informed 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
works 
of 
God 
the 
more 
will 
we 
be 
disposed 
to 
find 
them 
excellent 
and 
conforming 
entirely 
to 
that 
which 
wemightdesire. 



II. 
Against 
those 
who 
hold 
that 
there 
is 
inthe 
works 
of 
God 
no 
goodness, 
or 
that 
the 
principlesof 
goodness 
and 
beauty 
are 
arbitrary. 



THEREFORE 
I 
AM 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
maintain 
that 
there 
are 
no 
principles 
of 
goodness 
or 
perfection 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
or 
in 
the 
ideas 
which 
God 
has 
about 
them, 
and 
who 
say 
that 
the 
works 
of 
God 
are 
good 
only 
through 
the 
formal 
reason 
that 
God 
has 
made 
them. 
If 
this 
position 
were 
true, 
God, 
knowing 
that 
he 
is 
the 
author 
of 
things, 
would 
not 
have 
to 
regard 
them 
afterwards 
and 
find 
them 
good, 
as 
the 
Holy 
Scripture 
witnesses. 
Such 
anthropological 
expressions 
are 
used 
only 
to 
letusknow 
that 
excellence 
is 
recognized 
in 
regarding 
the 
works 
themselves, 
even 
if 
we 
do 
not 
consider 
their 
evident 
dependence 
on 
their 
author. 
This 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
in 
reflecting 
upon 
the 
works 
that 
we 
are 
able 
to 
discover 
the 
one 
who 
wrought. 
They 
must 
therefore 
bear 
in 
themselves 
his 
character. 
I 
confess 
that 
the 
contrary 
opinion 
seems 
to 
me 
extremely 
dangerous 
and 
closely 
approaches 
that 
of 
recent 
innovators 
who 
hold 
that 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
the 
goodness 
which 
we 
attribute 
to 
the 
works 
of 
God 
are 
chimeras 
of 
human 
beings 
who 
think 
of 
God 
in 
human 
terms. 
In 
saying, 
therefore, 
that 
things 
are 
not 
good 
according 
to 
any 
standard 
of 
goodness, 
but 
simply 
by 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
one 
destroys, 
without 
realizing 
it, 
all 
the 
love 
of 
God 
and 
all 
his 
glory; 
for 
why 
praise 
him 
for 
what 
he 
has 
done, 
if 
he 
would 
be 
equally 
praiseworthy 
in 
doing 
the 
contrary? 
Where 
will 
be 
his 
justice 
and 
his 
wisdom 
if 
he 
has 
only 
a 
certain 
despotic 
power, 
if 
arbitrary 
will 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
reasonableness, 
and 
if 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
definition 
of 
tyrants, 
justice 
consists 
in 
that 
which 
is 
pleasing 
to 
the 
most 
powerful? 
Besides 
it 
seems 
that 
every 
act 
of 
willing 
supposes 
some 
reason 
for 
the 



willing 
and 
this 
reason, 
of 
course, 
must 
precede 
the 
act. 
This 
is 
why, 
accordingly, 
I 
find 
so 
strange 
those 
expressions 
of 
certain 
philosophers 
who 
say 
that 
the 
eternal 
truths 
of 
metaphysics 
and 
Geometry, 
and 
consequently 
the 
principles 
of 
goodness, 
of 
justice, 
and 
of 
perfection, 
are 
effects 
only 
of 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
To 
me 
it 
seems 
that 
all 
these 
follow 
from 
his 
understanding, 
which 
doesnotdependuponhiswillany 
more 
thandoeshisessence. 



III. 
Against 
those 
who 
think 
that 
God 
might 
have 
made 
things 
better 
than 
he 
has. 



NO 
MORE 
AM 
I 
able 
to 
approve 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
certain 
modern 
writers 
who 
boldly 
maintain 
that 
that 
which 
God 
has 
made 
is 
not 
perfect 
in 
the 
highest 
degree, 
and 
that 
he 
might 
have 
done 
better. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
consequences 
of 
such 
an 
opinion 
are 
wholly 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
glory 
of 
God. 
Uti 
minus 
malum 
habet 
rationem 
boni, 
ita 
minus 
bonum 
habet 
rationem 
mali. 
I 
think 
that 
one 
acts 
imperfectly 
if 
he 
acts 
with 
less 
perfection 
than 
he 
is 
capable 
of. 
To 
show 
that 
an 
architect 
could 
have 
done 
better 
is 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
his 
work. 
Furthermore 
this 
opinion 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures 
when 
they 
assure 
us 
of 
the 
goodness 
of 
God’s 
work. 
For 
if 
comparative 
perfection 
were 
sufficient, 
then 
in 
whatever 
way 
God 
had 
accomplished 
his 
work, 
since 
there 
is 
an 
infinitude 
of 
possible 
imperfections, 
it 
would 
always 
have 
been 
good 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
less 
perfect; 
but 
a 
thing 
is 
little 
praiseworthy 
when 
itcanbepraisedonly 
inthis 
way. 


I 
believe 
that 
a 
great 
many 
passages 
from 
the 
divine 
writings 
and 
from 
the 
holy 
fathers 
will 
be 
found 
favoring 
my 
position, 
while 
hardly 
any 
will 
be 
found 
in 
favor 
of 
that 
of 
these 
modern 
thinkers. 
Their 
opinion 
is, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
unknown 
to 
the 
writers 
of 
antiquity 
and 
is 
a 
deduction 
based 
upon 
the 
too 
slight 
acquaintaince 
which 
we 
have 
with 
the 
general 
harmony 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
with 
the 
hidden 
reasons 
for 
God’s 
conduct. 
In 
our 
ignorance, 
therefore, 
we 
are 
tempted 
to 
decide 
audaciously 
that 
many 
things 
might 
have 
beendonebetter. 


These 
modern 
thinkers 
insist 
upon 
certain 
hardly 
tenable 
subtleties, 
for 
they 
imagine 
that 
nothing 
is 
so 
perfect 
that 
there 
might 
not 
have 
been 
something 
more 
perfect. 
This 
is 
an 
error. 
They 
think, 
indeed, 
that 
they 
are 



thus 
safeguarding 
the 
liberty 
of 
God. 
As 
if 
it 
were 
not 
the 
highest 
liberty 
to 
act 
in 
perfection 
according 
to 
the 
sovereign 
reason. 
For 
to 
think 
that 
God 
acts 
in 
anything 
without 
having 
any 
reason 
for 
his 
willing, 
even 
if 
we 
overlook 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
action 
seems 
impossible, 
is 
an 
opinion 
which 
conforms 
little 
to 
God’s 
glory. 
For 
example, 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
God 
chooses 
between 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
that 
he 
takes 
A 
without 
any 
reason 
for 
preferring 
it 
to 
B. 
I 
say 
that 
this 
action 
on 
the 
part 
of 
God 
is 
at 
least 
not 
praiseworthy, 
for 
all 
praise 
ought 
to 
be 
founded 
upon 
reason 
which 
ex 
hypothesi 
is 
not 
present 
here. 
My 
opinion 
is 
that 
God 
does 
nothing 
for 
which 
he 
does 
not 
deserve 
to 
be 
glorified. 



IV. 
Thatlove 
for 
God 
demandson 
our 
part 
complete 
satisfactionwith 
and 
acquiescence 
in 
that 
which 
he 
hasdone. 
THE 
GENERAL 
KNOWLEDGE 
of 
this 
great 
truth 
that 
God 
acts 
always 
in 
the 
most 
perfect 
and 
most 
desirable 
manner 
possible, 
is 
in 
my 
opinion 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
love 
which 
we 
owe 
to 
God 
in 
all 
things; 
for 
he 
who 
loves 
seeks 
his 
satisfaction 
in 
the 
felicity 
or 
perfection 
of 
the 
object 
loved 
and 
in 
the 
perfection 
of 
his 
actions. 
Idem 
velle 
et 
idem 
nolle 
vera 
amicitia 
est. 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
love 
God 
truly 
when 
one, 
having 
the 
power 
to 
change 
his 
disposition, 
is 
not 
disposed 
to 
wish 
for 
that 
which 
God 
desires. 
In 
fact 
those 
who 
are 
not 
satisfied 
with 
what 
God 
does 
seem 
to 
me 
like 
dissatisfied 
subjects 
whose 
attitude 
is 
not 
very 
different 
from 
that 
of 
rebels. 
I 
hold 
therefore, 
that 
on 
these 
principles, 
to 
act 
conformably 
to 
the 
love 
of 
God 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
force 
oneself 
to 
be 
patient, 
we 
must 
be 
really 
satisfied 
with 
all 
that 
comes 
to 
us 
according 
to 
his 
will. 
I 
mean 
this 
acquiescence 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
past; 
for 
as 
regards 
the 
future 
one 
should 
not 
be 
a 
quietist 
with 
the 
arms 
folded, 
open 
to 
ridicule, 
awaiting 
that 
which 
God 
will 
do; 
according 
to 
the 
sophism 
which 
the 
ancients 
called 
λόγον 
άεργον, 
the 
lazy 
reason. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
act 
conformably 
to 
the 
presumptive 
will 
of 
God 
as 
far 
as 
we 
are 
able 
to 
judge 
of 
it, 
trying 
with 
all 
our 
might 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
general 
welfare 
and 
particularly 
to 
the 
ornamentation 
and 
the 
perfection 
of 
that 
which 
touches 
us, 
or 
of 
that 
which 
is 
nigh 
and 
so 
to 
speak 
at 
our 
hand. 
For 
if 
the 
future 
shall 
perhaps 
show 
that 
God 
has 
not 
wished 
our 
good 
intention 
to 
have 
its 
way, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
he 
has 
not 
wished 
us 
to 
act 
as 
we 
have; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
since 
he 
is 
the 
best 
of 
all 
masters, 
he 
ever 
demands 
only 
the 
right 
intentions, 
and 
it 
is 
for 
him 
to 
know 
the 
hour 
and 
the 
proper 
place 
to 
let 
good 
designssucceed. 



V. 
In 
what 
theprinciples 
ofthe 
divine 
perfection 
consist, 
and 
that 
the 
simplicity 
ofthe 
means 
counterbalancesthe 
richnessof 
theeffects. 



IT 
IS 
SUFFICIENT 
therefore 
to 
have 
this 
confidence 
in 
God, 
that 
he 
has 
done 
everything 
for 
the 
best 
and 
that 
nothing 
will 
be 
able 
to 
injure 
those 
who 
love 
him. 
To 
know 
in 
particular, 
however, 
the 
reasons 
which 
have 
moved 
him 
to 
choose 
this 
order 
of 
the 
universe, 
to 
permit 
sin, 
to 
dispense 
his 
salutary 
grace 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
— 
this 
passes 
the 
capacity 
of 
a 
finite 
mind, 
above 
all 
when 
such 
a 
mind 
has 
not 
come 
into 
the 
joy 
of 
the 
vision 
of 
God. 
Yet 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
make 
some 
general 
remarks 
touching 
the 
course 
of 
providence 
in 
the 
government 
of 
things. 
One 
is 
able 
to 
say, 
therefore, 
that 
he 
who 
acts 
perfectly 
is 
like 
an 
excellent 
Geometer 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
find 
the 
best 
construction 
for 
a 
problem; 
like 
a 
good 
architect 
who 
utilizes 
his 
location 
and 
the 
funds 
destined 
for 
the 
building 
in 
the 
most 
advantageous 
manner, 
leaving 
nothing 
which 
shocks 
or 
which 
does 
not 
display 
that 
beauty 
of 
which 
it 
is 
capable; 
like 
a 
good 
householder 
who 
employs 
his 
property 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
there 
shall 
be 
nothing 
uncultivated 
or 
sterile; 
like 
a 
clever 
machinist 
who 
makes 
his 
production 
in 
the 
least 
difficult 
way 
possible; 
and 
like 
an 
intelligent 
author 
who 
encloses 
the 
most 
of 
reality 
in 
the 
least 
possible 
compass. 


Of 
all 
beings 
those 
which 
are 
the 
most 
perfect 
and 
occupy 
the 
least 
possible 
space, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
those 
which 
interfere 
with 
one 
another 
the 
least, 
are 
the 
spirits 
whose 
perfections 
are 
the 
virtues. 
That 
is 
why 
we 
may 
not 
doubt 
that 
the 
felicity 
of 
the 
spirits 
is 
the 
principal 
aim 
of 
God 
and 
that 
he 
puts 
this 
purpose 
into 
execution, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
general 
harmony 
will 
permit. 
We 
willrecurtothissubjectagain. 



When 
the 
simplicity 
of 
God’s 
way 
is 
spoken 
of, 
reference 
is 
specially 
made 
to 
the 
means 
which 
he 
employs, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
when 
the 
variety, 
richness 
and 
abundance 
are 
referred 
to, 
the 
ends 
or 
effects 
are 
had 
in 
mind. 
Thus 
one 
ought 
to 
be 
proportioned 
to 
the 
other, 
just 
as 
the 
cost 
of 
a 
building 
should 
balance 
the 
beauty 
and 
grandeur 
which 
is 
expected. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
nothing 
costs 
God 
anything,justasthere 
is 
nocostfor 
a 
philosopher 
who 
makes 
hypotheses 
in 
constructing 
his 
imaginary 
world, 
because 
God 
has 
only 
to 
make 
decrees 
in 
order 
that 
a 
real 
world 
come 
into 
being; 
but 
in 
matters 
of 
wisdom 
the 
decrees 
or 
hypotheses 
meet 
the 
expenditure 
in 
proportion 
as 
they 
are 
more 
independent 
of 
one 
another. 
The 
reason 
wishes 
to 
avoid 
multiplicity 
in 
hypotheses 
or 
principles 
very 
much 
as 
the 
simplest 
system 
is 
preferred 
in 
Astronomy. 



VI. 
That 
God 
does 
nothing 
which 
isnot 
orderly, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
not 
even 
possible 
to 
conceive 
of 
events 
which 
are 
not 
regular. 
THE 
ACTIVITIES 
OR 
the 
acts 
of 
will 
of 
God 
are 
commonly 
divided 
into 
ordinary 
and 
extraordinary. 
But 
it 
is 
well 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
God 
does 
nothing 
out 
of 
order. 
Therefore, 
that 
which 
passes 
for 
extraordinary 
is 
so 
only 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
particular 
order 
established 
among 
the 
created 
things, 
for 
as 
regards 
the 
universal 
order, 
everything 
conforms 
to 
it. 
This 
is 
so 
true 
that 
not 
only 
does 
nothing 
occur 
in 
this 
world 
which 
is 
absolutely 
irregular, 
but 
it 
is 
even 
impossible 
to 
conceive 
of 
such 
an 
occurrence. 
Because, 
let 
us 
suppose 
for 
example 
that 
some 
one 
jots 
down 
a 
quantity 
of 
points 
upon 
a 
sheet 
of 
paper 
helter 
skelter, 
as 
do 
those 
who 
exercise 
the 
ridiculous 
art 
of 
Geomancy; 
now 
I 
say 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
find 
a 
geometrical 
line 
whose 
concept 
shall 
be 
uniformand 
constant,thatis,inaccordancewith 
acertainformula,andwhich 
line 
at 
the 
same 
time 
shall 
pass 
through 
all 
of 
those 
points, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
order 
in 
which 
the 
hand 
jotted 
them 
down; 
also 
if 
a 
continuous 
line 
be 
traced, 
which 
is 
now 
straight, 
now 
circular, 
and 
now 
of 
any 
other 
description, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
find 
a 
mental 
equivalent, 
a 
formula 
or 
an 
equation 
common 
to 
all 
the 
points 
of 
this 
line 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
formula 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
line 
must 
occur. 
There 
is 
no 
instance 
of 
a 
face 
whose 
contour 
does 
not 
form 
part 
of 
a 
geometric 
line 
and 
which 
can 
not 
be 
traced 
entire 
by 
a 
certain 
mathematical 
motion. 
But 
when 
the 
formula 
is 
very 
complex, 
that 
which 
conforms 
to 
it 
passes 
for 
irregular. 
Thus 
we 
may 
say 
that 
in 
whatever 
manner 
God 
might 
have 
created 
the 
world, 
it 
would 
always 
have 
been 
regular 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
order. 
God, 
however, 
has 
chosen 
the 
most 
perfect, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
the 
one 
which 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
simplest 
in 
hypotheses 
and 
the 
richest 
in 
phenomena, 
as 
might 
be 
the 
case 
with 
a 
geometric 
line, 
whose 
construction 



was 
easy, 
but 
whose 
properties 
and 
effects 
were 
extremely 
remarkable 
and 
of 
great 
significance. 
I 
use 
these 
comparisons 
to 
picture 
a 
certain 
imperfect 
resemblance 
to 
the 
divine 
wisdom, 
and 
to 
point 
out 
that 
which 
may 
at 
least 
raise 
our 
minds 
to 
conceive 
in 
some 
sort 
what 
cannot 
otherwise 
be 
expressed. 
I 
do 
not 
pretend 
at 
all 
to 
explain 
thus 
the 
great 
mystery 
upon 
which 
depends 
thewhole 
universe. 



VII. 
That 
miracles 
conform 
to 
theregular 
order 
although 
they 
go 
against 
the 
subordinate 
regulations; 
concerning 
thatwhich 
God 
desires 
or 
permits 
andconcerning 
generaland 
particular 
intentions. 
NOW 
SINCE 
NOTHING 
is 
done 
which 
is 
not 
orderly, 
we 
may 
say 
that 
miracles 
are 
quite 
within 
the 
order 
of 
natural 
operations. 
We 
use 
the 
term 
natural 
of 
these 
operations 
because 
they 
conform 
to 
certain 
subordinate 
regulations 
which 
we 
call 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 
For 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
this 
nature 
is 
only 
a 
custom 
of 
God’s 
which 
he 
can 
change 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
a 
stronger 
reason 
than 
that 
which 
moved 
him 
to 
use 
these 
regulations. 
As 
regards 
general 
and 
particular 
intentions, 
according 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
we 
understand 
the 
matter, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
that 
everything 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
most 
general 
intention, 
or 
that 
which 
best 
conforms 
to 
the 
most 
perfect 
order 
he 
has 
chosen; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
however, 
it 
is 
also 
possible 
to 
say 
that 
he 
has 
particular 
intentions 
which 
are 
exceptions 
to 
the 
subordinate 
regulations 
above 
mentioned. 
Of 
God’s 
laws, 
however, 
the 
most 
universal, 
i.e. 
that 
which 
rules 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
the 
universe, 
is 
without 
exceptions. 


It 
is 
possible 
to 
say 
that 
God 
desires 
everything 
which 
is 
an 
object 
of 
his 
particular 
intention. 
When 
we 
consider 
the 
objects 
of 
his 
general 
intentions, 
however, 
such 
as 
are 
the 
modes 
of 
activities 
of 
created 
things 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
reasoning 
creatures 
with 
whom 
God 
wishes 
to 
co-operate, 
we 
must 
make 
a 
distinction; 
for 
if 
the 
action 
is 
good 
in 
itself, 
we 
may 
say 
that 
God 
wishes 
it 
and 
at 
times 
commands 
it, 
even 
though 
it 
does 
not 
take 
place; 
but 
if 
it 
is 
bad 
in 
itself 
and 
becomes 
good 
only 
by 
accident 
through 
the 
course 
of 
events 
and 
especially 
after 
chastisement 
and 
satisfaction 
have 
corrected 
its 



malignity 
and 
rewarded 
the 
ill 
with 
interest 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
more 
perfection 
results 
in 
the 
whole 
train 
of 
circumstances 
than 
would 
have 
come 
if 
that 
ill 
had 
not 
occurred, 
— 
if 
all 
this 
takes 
place 
we 
must 
say 
that 
God 
permits 
the 
evil, 
and 
not 
that 
he 
desired 
it, 
although 
he 
has 
co-operated 
by 
means 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
which 
he 
has 
established. 
He 
knows 
how 
to 
producethe 
greatestgood 
fromthem. 



VIII. 
In 
order 
to 
distinguishbetween 
the 
activities 
ofGod 
and 
the 
activitiesof 
created 
things 
we 
must 
explain 
the 
conception 
of 
an 
individual 
substance. 



IT 
IS 
QUITE 
difficult 
to 
distinguish 
God’s 
actions 
from 
those 
of 
his 
creatures. 
Some 
think 
that 
God 
does 
everything; 
others 
imagine 
that 
he 
only 
conserves 
the 
force 
that 
he 
has 
given 
to 
created 
things. 
How 
far 
can 
we 
say 
either 
oftheseopinions 
isright? 


In 
the 
first 
place 
since 
activity 
and 
passivity 
pertain 
properly 
to 
individual 
substances 
(actiones 
sunt 
suppositorum) 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
explain 
what 
such 
a 
substance 
is. 
It 
is 
indeed 
true 
that 
when 
several 
predicates 
are 
attributes 
of 
a 
single 
subject 
and 
this 
subject 
is 
not 
an 
attribute 
of 
another, 
we 
speak 
of 
it 
as 
an 
individual 
substance, 
but 
this 
is 
not 
enough, 
and 
such 
an 
explanation 
is 
merely 
nominal. 
We 
must 
therefore 
inquire 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
an 
attribute 
in 
reality 
of 
a 
certain 
subject. 
Now 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
every 
true 
predication 
has 
some 
basis 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
even 
when 
a 
proposition 
is 
not 
identical, 
that 
is, 
when 
the 
predicate 
is 
not 
expressly 
contained 
in 
the 
subject, 
it 
is 
still 
necessary 
that 
it 
be 
virtually 
contained 
in 
it, 
and 
this 
is 
what 
the 
philosophers 
call 
in-esse, 
saying 
thereby 
that 
the 
predicate 
is 
in 
the 
subject. 
Thus 
the 
content 
of 
the 
subject 
must 
always 
include 
that 
of 
the 
predicate 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
if 
one 
understands 
perfectly 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
subject, 
he 
will 
know 
that 
the 
predicate 
appertains 
to 
it 
also. 
This 
being 
so, 
we 
are 
able 
to 
say 
that 
this 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
individual 
substance 
or 
of 
a 
complete 
being, 
namely, 
to 
afford 
a 
conception 
so 
complete 
that 
the 
concept 
shall 
be 
sufficient 
for 
the 
understanding 
of 
it 
and 
for 
the 
deduction 
of 
all 
the 
predicates 
of 
which 
the 
substance 
is 
or 
may 
become 
the 
subject. 
Thus 
the 
quality 
of 
king, 
which 
belonged 
to 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
an 



abstraction 
from 
the 
subject, 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
determined 
to 
constitute 
an 
individual, 
and 
does 
not 
contain 
the 
other 
qualities 
of 
the 
same 
subject, 
nor 
everything 
which 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
prince 
includes. 
God, 
however, 
seeing 
the 
individual 
concept, 
or 
hæcceity, 
of 
Alexander, 
sees 
there 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
basis 
and 
the 
reason 
of 
all 
the 
predicates 
which 
can 
be 
truly 
uttered 
regarding 
him; 
for 
instance 
that 
he 
will 
conquer 
Darius 
and 
Porus, 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
knowing 
a 
priori 
(and 
not 
by 
experience) 
whether 
he 
died 
a 
natural 
death 
or 
by 
poison, 
— 
facts 
which 
we 
can 
learn 
only 
through 
history. 
When 
we 
carefully 
consider 
the 
connection 
of 
things 
we 
see 
also 
the 
possibility 
of 
saying 
that 
there 
was 
always 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
Alexander 
marks 
of 
all 
that 
had 
happened 
to 
him 
and 
evidences 
of 
all 
that 
would 
happen 
to 
him 
and 
traces 
even 
of 
everything 
which 
occurs 
in 
the 
universe, 
although 
God 
alone 
could 
recognizethemall. 



IX. 
That 
every 
individualsubstance 
expressesthe 
whole 
universe 
in 
its 
own 
manner 
and 
that 
in 
its 
full 
concept 
is 
included 
all 
its 
experiences 
together 
with 
allthe 
attendent 
circumstances 
andthe 
whole 
sequence 
of 
exterior 
events. 



THERE 
FOLLOW 
FROM 
these 
considerations 
several 
noticeable 
paradoxes; 
among 
others 
that 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
two 
substances 
may 
be 
exactly 
alike 
and 
differ 
only 
numerically, 
solo 
numero, 
and 
that 
what 
St. 
Thomas 
says 
on 
this 
point 
regarding 
angels 
and 
intelligences 
(quod 
ibi 
omne 
individuum 
sit 
species 
infima) 
is 
true 
of 
all 
substances, 
provided 
that 
the 
specific 
difference 
is 
understood 
as 
Geometers 
understand 
it 
in 
the 
case 
of 
figures; 
again 
that 
a 
substance 
will 
be 
able 
to 
commence 
only 
through 
creation 
and 
perish 
only 
through 
annihilation; 
that 
a 
substance 
cannot 
be 
divided 
into 
two 
nor 
can 
one 
be 
made 
out 
of 
two, 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
number 
of 
substances 
neither 
augments 
nor 
diminishes 
through 
natural 
means, 
although 
they 
are 
frequently 
transformed. 
Furthermore 
every 
substance 
is 
like 
an 
entire 
world 
and 
like 
a 
mirror 
of 
God, 
or 
indeed 
of 
the 
whole 
world 
which 
it 
portrays, 
each 
one 
in 
its 
own 
fashion;almost 
as 
thesame 
city 
is 
variously 
represented 
according 
to 
the 
various 
situations 
of 
him 
who 
is 
regarding 
it. 
Thus 
the 
universe 
is 
multiplied 
in 
some 
sort 
as 
many 
times 
as 
there 
are 
substances, 
and 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
is 
multiplied 
in 
the 
same 
way 
by 
as 
many 
wholly 
different 
representations 
of 
his 
works. 
It 
can 
indeed 
be 
said 
that 
every 
substance 
bears 
in 
some 
sort 
the 
character 
of 
God’s 
infinite 
wisdom 
and 
omnipotence, 
and 
imitates 
him 
as 
much 
as 
it 
is 
able 
to; 
for 
it 
expresses, 
although 
confusedly, 
all 
that 
happens 
in 
the 
universe, 
past, 
present 
and 
future, 
deriving 
thus 
a 
certain 
resemblance 
to 
an 
infinite 
perception 
or 
power 
of 
knowing. 
And 
since 
all 
other 
substances 
express 
this 
particular 
substance 
and 
accommodate 
themselves 
to 
it, 
we 
can 



say 
that 
it 
exerts 
its 
power 
upon 
all 
the 
others 
in 
imitation 
of 
the 
omnipotence 
ofthecreator. 



X. 
That 
the 
belief 
in 
substantial 
forms 
has 
a 
certain 
basis 
in 
fact, 
but 
that 
these 
forms 
effectno 
changes 
in 
the 
phenomena 
and 
must 
not 
be 
employed 
for 
theexplanation 
of 
particular 
events. 



IT 
SEEMS 
THAT 
the 
ancients, 
able 
men, 
who 
were 
accustomed 
to 
profound 
meditations 
and 
taught 
theology 
and 
philosophy 
for 
several 
centuries 
and 
some 
of 
whom 
recommend 
themselves 
to 
us 
on 
account 
of 
their 
piety, 
had 
some 
knowledge 
of 
that 
which 
we 
have 
just 
said 
and 
this 
is 
why 
they 
introduced 
and 
maintained 
the 
substantial 
forms 
so 
much 
decried 
to-day. 
But 
they 
were 
not 
so 
far 
from 
the 
truth 
nor 
so 
open 
to 
ridicule 
as 
the 
common 
run 
of 
our 
new 
philosophers 
imagine. 
Igrant 
that 
theconsiderationof 
these 
forms 
is 
of 
no 
service 
in 
the 
details 
of 
physics 
and 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
employed 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
particular 
phenomena. 
In 
regard 
to 
this 
last 
point, 
the 
schoolmen 
were 
at 
fault, 
as 
were 
also 
the 
physicians 
of 
times 
past 
who 
followed 
their 
example, 
thinking 
they 
had 
given 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
properties 
of 
a 
body 
in 
mentioning 
the 
forms 
and 
qualities 
without 
going 
to 
the 
trouble 
of 
examining 
the 
manner 
of 
operation; 
as 
if 
one 
should 
be 
content 
to 
say 
that 
a 
clock 
had 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
clockness 
derived 
from 
its 
form, 
and 
should 
not 
inquire 
in 
what 
that 
clockness 
consisted. 
This 
is 
indeed 
enough 
for 
the 
man 
who 
buys 
it, 
provided 
he 
surrenders 
the 
care 
of 
it 
to 
someone 
else. 
The 
fact, 
however, 
that 
there 
was 
this 
misunderstanding 
and 
misuse 
of 
the 
substantial 
forms 
should 
not 
bring 
us 
to 
throw 
away 
something 
whose 
recognition 
is 
so 
necessary 
in 
metaphysics. 
Since 
without 
these 
we 
will 
not 
be 
able, 
I 
hold, 
to 
know 
the 
ultimate 
principles 
nor 
to 
lift 
our 
minds 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
incorporeal 
natures 
and 
of 
the 
marvels 
of 
God. 
Yet 
as 
the 
geometer 
does 
not 
need 
to 
encumber 
his 
mind 
with 
the 
famous 
puzzle 
of 
the 



composition 
of 
the 
continuum, 
and 
as 
no 
moralist, 
and 
still 
less 
a 
jurist 
or 
a 
statesmanhasneedtotrouble 
himselfwiththe 
great 
difficultieswhich 
arisein 
conciliating 
free 
will 
with 
the 
providential 
activity 
of 
God, 
(since 
the 
geometer 
is 
able 
to 
make 
all 
his 
demonstrations 
and 
the 
statesman 
can 
complete 
all 
his 
deliberations 
without 
entering 
into 
these 
discussions 
which 
are 
so 
necessary 
and 
important 
in 
Philosophy 
and 
Theology), 
so 
in 
the 
same 
way 
the 
physicist 
can 
explain 
his 
experiments, 
now 
using 
simpler 
experiments 
already 
made, 
now 
employing 
geometrical 
and 
mechanical 
demonstrations 
without 
any 
need 
of 
the 
general 
considerations 
which 
belong 
to 
another 
sphere, 
and 
if 
he 
employs 
the 
co-operation 
of 
God, 
or 
perhaps 
of 
some 
soul 
or 
animating 
force, 
or 
something 
else 
of 
a 
similar 
nature, 
he 
goes 
out 
of 
his 
path 
quite 
as 
much 
as 
that 
man 
who, 
when 
facing 
an 
important 
practical 
question 
would 
wish 
to 
enter 
into 
profound 
argumentations 
regarding 
the 
nature 
of 
destiny 
and 
of 
our 
liberty; 
a 
fault 
which 
men 
quite 
frequently 
commit 
without 
realizing 
it 
when 
they 
cumber 
their 
minds 
with 
considerations 
regarding 
fate, 
and 
thus 
they 
are 
even 
sometimes 
turned 
from 
a 
goodresolutionorfromsomenecessaryprovision. 



XI. 
That 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
theologians 
and 
of 
theso-called 
scholastic 
philosophers 
are 
not 
to 
bewholly 
despised. 
I 
KNOW 
THAT 
I 
am 
advancing 
a 
great 
paradox 
in 
pretending 
to 
resuscitate 
in 
some 
sort 
the 
ancient 
philosophy, 
and 
to 
recall 
postliminio 
the 
substantial 
forms 
almost 
banished 
from 
our 
modern 
thought. 
But 
perhaps 
I 
will 
not 
be 
condemned 
lightly 
when 
it 
is 
known 
that 
I 
have 
long 
meditated 
over 
the 
modern 
philosophy 
and 
that 
I 
have 
devoted 
much 
time 
to 
experiments 
in 
physics 
and 
to 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
geometry 
and 
that 
I, 
too, 
for 
a 
long 
time 
was 
persuaded 
of 
the 
baselessness 
of 
those 
“beings” 
which, 
however, 
I 
was 
finally 
obliged 
to 
take 
up 
again 
in 
spite 
of 
myself 
and 
as 
though 
by 
force. 
The 
many 
investigations 
which 
I 
carried 
on 
compelled 
me 
to 
recognize 
that 
our 
moderns 
do 
not 
do 
sufficient 
justice 
to 
Saint 
Thomas 
and 
to 
the 
other 
great 
men 
of 
that 
period 
and 
that 
there 
is 
in 
the 
theories 
of 
the 
scholastic 
philosophers 
and 
theologians 
far 
more 
solidity 
than 
is 
imagined, 
provided 
that 
these 
theories 
are 
employed 
à 
propos 
and 
in 
their 
place. 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
if 
some 
careful 
and 
meditative 
mind 
were 
to 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
clarify 
and 
direct 
their 
thoughts 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
analytic 
geometers, 
he 
would 
find 
a 
greattreasure 
ofveryimportanttruths,wholly 
demonstrable. 



XII. 
That 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
extension 
of 
a 
body 
is 
in 
a 
way 
imaginary 
and 
doesnot 
constitute 
the 
substanceof 
thebody. 
BUT 
TO 
RESUME 
the 
thread 
of 
our 
discussion, 
I 
believe 
that 
he 
who 
will 
meditate 
upon 
the 
nature 
of 
substance, 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
it 
above, 
will 
find 
that 
the 
whole 
nature 
of 
bodies 
is 
not 
exhausted 
in 
their 
extension, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
their 
size, 
figure 
and 
motion, 
but 
that 
we 
must 
recognize 
something 
which 
corresponds 
to 
soul, 
something 
which 
is 
commonly 
called 
substantial 
form, 
although 
these 
forms 
effect 
no 
change 
in 
the 
phenomena, 
any 
more 
than 
do 
the 
souls 
of 
beasts, 
that 
is 
if 
they 
have 
souls. 
It 
is 
even 
possible 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
ideas 
of 
size, 
figure 
and 
motion 
are 
not 
so 
distinctive 
as 
is 
imagined, 
and 
that 
they 
stand 
for 
something 
imaginary 
relative 
to 
our 
preceptions 
as 
do, 
although 
to 
a 
greater 
extent, 
the 
ideas 
of 
color, 
heat, 
and 
the 
other 
similar 
qualities 
in 
regard 
to 
which 
we 
may 
doubt 
whether 
they 
are 
actually 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
things 
outside 
of 
us. 
This 
is 
why 
these 
latter 
qualities 
are 
unable 
to 
constitute 
“substance” 
and 
if 
there 
is 
no 
other 
principle 
of 
identity 
in 
bodies 
than 
that 
which 
has 
just 
been 
referred 
to 
a 
bodywouldnotsubsistmorethan 
for 
amoment. 


The 
souls 
and 
the 
substance-forms 
of 
other 
bodies 
are 
entirely 
different 
from 
intelligent 
souls 
which 
alone 
know 
their 
actions, 
and 
not 
only 
do 
not 
perish 
through 
natural 
means 
but 
indeed 
always 
retain 
the 
knowledge 
of 
what 
they 
are; 
a 
fact 
which 
makes 
them 
alone 
open 
to 
chastisement 
or 
recompense, 
and 
makes 
them 
citizens 
of 
the 
republic 
of 
the 
universe 
whose 
monarch 
is 
God. 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
all 
the 
other 
creatures 
should 
serve 
them, 
a 
point 
which 
we 
shalldiscussmoreamply 
later. 



XIII. 
As 
the 
individualconcept 
of 
each 
person 
includes 
once 
for 
all 
everything 
which 
can 
ever 
happen 
to 
him, 
in 
it 
can 
beseen, 
a 
priori 
the 
evidences 
or 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
realityof 
each 
event, 
and 
why 
one 
happenedsoonerthan 
the 
other. 
But 
these 
events, 
however 
certain, 
are 
nevertheless 
contingent, 
being 
based 
onthe 
free 
choice 
ofGod 
andof 
his 
creatures. 
Itis 
true 
that 
their 
choices 
always 
have 
their 
reasons, 
but 
they 
incline 
to 
the 
choicesunder 
no 
compulsion 
of 
necessity. 



BUT 
BEFORE 
GOING 
further 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
meet 
a 
difficulty 
which 
may 
arise 
regarding 
the 
principles 
which 
we 
have 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
preceding. 
We 
have 
said 
that 
the 
concept 
of 
an 
individual 
substance 
includes 
once 
for 
all 
everything 
which 
can 
ever 
happen 
to 
it 
and 
that 
in 
considering 
this 
concept 
one 
will 
be 
able 
to 
see 
everything 
which 
can 
truly 
be 
said 
concerning 
the 
individual, 
just 
as 
we 
are 
able 
to 
see 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
circle 
all 
the 
properties 
which 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
it. 
But 
does 
it 
not 
seem 
that 
in 
this 
way 
the 
difference 
between 
contingent 
and 
necessary 
truths 
will 
be 
destroyed, 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
place 
for 
human 
liberty, 
and 
that 
an 
absolute 
fatality 
will 
rule 
as 
well 
over 
all 
our 
actions 
as 
over 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
events 
of 
the 
world? 
To 
this 
I 
reply 
that 
a 
distinction 
must 
be 
made 
between 
that 
which 
is 
certain 
and 
that 
which 
is 
necessary. 
Every 
one 
grants 
that 
future 
contingencies 
are 
assured 
since 
God 
foresees 
them, 
but 
we 
do 
not 
say 
just 
because 
of 
that 
that 
they 
are 
necessary. 
But 
it 
will 
be 
objected, 
that 
if 
any 
conclusion 
can 
be 
deduced 
infallibly 
from 
some 
definition 
or 
concept, 
it 
is 
necessary; 
and 
now 
since 
we 
have 
maintained 
that 
everything 
which 
is 
to 
happen 
to 
anyone 
is 
already 
virtually 
included 
in 
his 
nature 
or 
concept, 
as 
all 
the 
properties 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
circle, 
therefore, 
the 
difficulty 
still 
remains. 
In 



order 
to 
meet 
the 
objection 
completely, 
I 
say 
that 
the 
connection 
or 
sequence 
is 
of 
two 
kinds; 
the 
one, 
absolutely 
necessary, 
whose 
contrary 
implies 
contradiction, 
occurs 
in 
the 
eternal 
verities 
like 
the 
truths 
of 
geometry; 
the 
otheris 
necessary 
only 
ex 
hypothesi, 
and 
so 
to 
speak 
by 
accident, 
and 
in 
itself 
it 
is 
contingent 
since 
the 
contrary 
is 
not 
implied. 
This 
latter 
sequence 
is 
not 
founded 
upon 
ideas 
wholly 
pure 
and 
upon 
the 
pure 
understanding 
of 
God, 
but 
upon 
his 
free 
decrees 
and 
upon 
the 
processes 
of 
the 
universe. 
Let 
us 
give 
an 
example. 
Since 
Julius 
Caesar 
will 
become 
perpetual 
Dictator 
and 
master 
of 
the 
Republic 
and 
will 
overthrow 
the 
liberty 
of 
Rome, 
this 
action 
is 
contained 
in 
his 
concept, 
for 
we 
have 
supposed 
that 
it 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
such 
a 
perfect 
concept 
of 
a 
subject 
to 
involve 
everything, 
in 
fact 
so 
that 
the 
predicate 
may 
be 
included 
in 
the 
subject 
ut 
possit 
inesse 
subjecto. 
We 
may 
say 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
virtue 
of 
this 
concept 
or 
idea 
that 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
perform 
this 
action, 
since 
it 
pertains 
to 
him 
only 
because 
God 
knows 
everything. 
But 
it 
will 
be 
insisted 
in 
reply 
that 
his 
nature 
or 
form 
responds 
to 
this 
concept, 
and 
since 
God 
imposesupon 
him 
this 
personality,he 
is 
compelledhenceforthto 
liveup 
to 
it. 
I 
could 
reply 
by 
instancing 
the 
similar 
case 
of 
the 
future 
contingencies 
which 
as 
yet 
have 
no 
reality 
save 
in 
the 
understanding 
and 
will 
of 
God, 
and 
which, 
because 
God 
has 
given 
them 
in 
advance 
this 
form, 
must 
needs 
correspond 
to 
it. 
But 
I 
prefer 
to 
overcome 
a 
difficulty 
rather 
than 
to 
excuse 
it 
by 
instancing 
other 
difficulties, 
and 
what 
I 
am 
about 
to 
say 
will 
serve 
to 
clear 
up 
the 
one 
as 
well 
as 
the 
other. 
It 
is 
here 
that 
must 
be 
applied 
the 
distinction 
in 
the 
kind 
of 
relation, 
and 
I 
say 
that 
that 
which 
happens 
conformably 
to 
these 
decrees 
is 
assured, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
not 
therefore 
necessary, 
and 
if 
anyone 
did 
the 
contrary, 
he 
would 
do 
nothing 
impossible 
in 
itself, 
although 
it 
is 
impossible 
ex 
hypothesi 
that 
that 
other 
happen. 
For 
if 
anyone 
were 
capable 
of 
carrying 
out 
a 
complete 
demonstration 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
he 
could 
prove 
this 
connection 
of 
the 
subject, 
which 
is 
Caesar, 
with 
the 
predicate, 
which 
is 
his 
successful 



enterprise, 
he 
would 
bring 
us 
to 
see 
in 
fact 
that 
the 
future 
dictatorship 
of 
Caesar 
had 
its 
basis 
in 
his 
concept 
or 
nature, 
so 
that 
one 
would 
see 
there 
a 
reason 
why 
he 
resolved 
to 
cross 
the 
Rubicon 
rather 
than 
to 
stop, 
and 
why 
he 
gained 
instead 
of 
losing 
the 
day 
at 
Pharsalus, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
reasonable 
and 
by 
consequence 
assured 
that 
this 
would 
occur, 
but 
one 
would 
not 
prove 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
in 
itself, 
nor 
that 
the 
contrary 
implied 
a 
contradiction, 
almost 
inthesameway 
inwhichitisreasonableandassuredthatGodwillalwaysdo 
what 
is 
best 
although 
that 
which 
is 
less 
perfect 
is 
not 
thereby 
implied. 
For 
it 
would 
be 
found 
that 
this 
demonstration 
of 
this 
predicate 
as 
belonging 
to 
Caesar 
is 
not 
as 
absolute 
as 
are 
those 
of 
numbers 
or 
of 
geometry, 
but 
that 
this 
predicate 
supposes 
a 
sequence 
of 
things 
which 
God 
has 
shown 
by 
his 
free 
will. 
This 
sequence 
is 
based 
on 
the 
first 
free 
decree 
of 
God 
which 
was 
to 
do 
always 
that 
which 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
and 
upon 
the 
decree 
which 
God 
made 
following 
the 
first 
one, 
regarding 
human 
nature, 
which 
is 
that 
men 
should 
always 
do, 
although 
freely, 
that 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
best. 
Now 
every 
truth 
which 
is 
founded 
upon 
this 
kind 
of 
decree 
is 
contingent, 
although 
certain, 
for 
the 
decrees 
of 
God 
do 
not 
change 
the 
possibilities 
of 
things 
and, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
although 
God 
assuredly 
chooses 
the 
best, 
this 
does 
not 
prevent 
that 
which 
is 
less 
perfect 
from 
being 
possible 
in 
itself. 
Although 
it 
will 
never 
happen, 
it 
is 
not 
its 
impossibility 
but 
its 
imperfection 
which 
causes 
him 
to 
reject 
it. 
Now 
nothing 
is 
necessitated 
whose 
opposite 
is 
possible. 
One 
will 
then 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
satisfy 
these 
kinds 
of 
difficulties, 
however 
great 
they 
may 
appear 
(and 
in 
fact 
they 
have 
not 
been 
less 
vexing 
to 
all 
other 
thinkers 
who 
have 
ever 
treated 
this 
matter), 
provided 
that 
he 
considers 
well 
that 
all 
contingent 
propositions 
have 
reasons 
why 
they 
are 
thus, 
rather 
than 
otherwise, 
or 
indeed 
(what 
is 
the 
same 
thing) 
that 
they 
have 
proof 
a 
priori 
of 
their 
truth, 
which 
render 
them 
certain 
and 
show 
that 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
subject 
and 
predicate 
in 
these 
propositions 
has 
its 
basis 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 



one 
and 
of 
the 
other, 
but 
he 
must 
further 
remember 
that 
such 
contingent 
propositions 
have 
not 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
necessity, 
since 
their 
reasons 
are 
founded 
only 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
contingency 
or 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
things, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
upon 
that 
which 
is, 
or 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
best 
among 
several 
things 
equally 
possible. 
Necessary 
truths, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
are 
founded 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction, 
and 
upon 
the 
possibility 
or 
impossibility 
of 
the 
essences 
themselves, 
without 
regard 
here 
to 
the 
free 
will 
ofGodorof 
creatures. 



XIV. 
God 
producesdifferent 
substances 
according 
to 
the 
different 
views 
which 
he 
hasof 
the 
world, 
and 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
God, 
the 
appropriate 
nature 
of 
each 
substance 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
what 
happens 
to 
one 
corresponds 
to 
what 
happens 
to 
allthe 
others, 
without, 
however, 
their 
acting 
upon 
one 
another 
directly. 
AFTER 
HAVING 
SEEN, 
to 
a 
certain 
extent, 
in 
what 
the 
nature 
of 
substances 
consists, 
we 
must 
try 
to 
explain 
the 
dependence 
they 
have 
upon 
one 
another 
and 
their 
actions 
and 
passions. 
Now 
it 
is 
first 
of 
all 
very 
evident 
that 
created 
substances 
depend 
upon 
God 
who 
preserves 
them 
and 
can 
produce 
them 
continually 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
emanation 
just 
as 
we 
produce 
our 
thoughts, 
for 
when 
God 
turns, 
so 
to 
say, 
on 
all 
sides 
and 
in 
all 
fashions, 
the 
general 
system 
of 
phenomena 
which 
he 
finds 
it 
good 
to 
produce 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
manifesting 
his 
glory, 
and 
when 
he 
regards 
all 
the 
aspects 
of 
the 
world 
in 
all 
possible 
manners, 
since 
there 
is 
no 
relation 
which 
escapes 
his 
omniscience, 
the 
result 
of 
each 
view 
of 
the 
universe 
as 
seen 
from 
a 
different 
position 
is 
a 
substance 
which 
expresses 
the 
universe 
conformably 
to 
this 
view, 
provided 
God 
sees 
fit 
to 
render 
his 
thought 
effective 
and 
to 
produce 
the 
substance, 
and 
since 
God’s 
vision 
is 
always 
true, 
our 
perceptions 
are 
always 
true 
and 
that 
which 
deceives 
us 
are 
our 
judgments, 
which 
are 
of 
us. 
Now 
we 
have 
said 
before, 
and 
it 
follows 
from 
what 
we 
have 
just 
said 
that 
each 
substance 
is 
a 
world 
by 
itself, 
independent 
of 
everything 
else 
excepting 
God; 
therefore, 
all 
our 
phenomena 
that 
is 
all 
things 
which 
are 
ever 
able 
to 
happen 
to 
us, 
are 
only 
consequences 
of 
our 
being. 
Now 
as 
the 
phenomena 
maintain 
a 
certain 
order 
conformably 
to 
our 
nature, 
or 
so 
to 
speak 
to 
the 
world 
which 
is 
in 
us 
(from 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
we 
can, 
for 
the 
regulation 
of 
our 
conduct, 
make 
useful 
observations 



which 
are 
justified 
by 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
future 
phenomena) 
and 
as 
we 
are 
thus 
able 
often 
to 
judge 
the 
future 
by 
the 
past 
without 
deceiving 
ourselves, 
we 
have 
sufficient 
grounds 
for 
saying 
that 
these 
phenomena 
are 
true 
and 
we 
will 
not 
be 
put 
to 
the 
task 
of 
inquiring 
whether 
they 
are 
outside 
of 
us, 
and 
whether 
othersperceive 
themalso. 


Nevertheless 
it 
is 
most 
true 
that 
the 
perceptions 
and 
expressions 
of 
all 
substances 
intercorrespond, 
so 
that 
each 
one 
following 
independently 
certain 
reasons 
or 
laws 
which 
he 
has 
noticed 
meets 
others 
which 
are 
doing 
the 
same, 
as 
when 
several 
have 
agreed 
to 
meet 
together 
in 
a 
certain 
place 
on 
a 
set 
day, 
they 
are 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
plan 
if 
they 
wish. 
Now 
although 
all 
express 
the 
same 
phenomena, 
this 
does 
not 
bring 
it 
about 
that 
their 
expressions 
are 
exactly 
alike. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
if 
they 
are 
proportional. 
As 
when 
several 
spectators 
think 
they 
see 
the 
same 
thing 
and 
are 
agreed 
about 
it, 
although 
each 
one 
sees 
or 
speaks 
according 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
his 
vision. 
It 
is 
God 
alone, 
(from 
whom 
all 
individuals 
emanate 
continually, 
and 
who 
sees 
the 
universe 
not 
only 
as 
they 
see 
it, 
but 
besides 
in 
a 
very 
different 
way 
from 
them) 
who 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
correspondence 
in 
their 
phenomena 
and 
who 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
that 
which 
is 
particular 
to 
one, 
is 
also 
common 
to 
all, 
otherwise 
there 
would 
be 
no 
relation. 
In 
a 
way, 
then, 
we 
might 
properly 
say, 
although 
it 
seems 
strange, 
that 
a 
particular 
substance 
never 
acts 
upon 
another 
particular 
substance 
nor 
is 
it 
acted 
upon 
by 
it. 
That 
which 
happens 
to 
each 
one 
is 
only 
the 
consequence 
of 
its 
complete 
idea 
or 
concept, 
since 
this 
idea 
already 
includes 
all 
the 
predicates 
and 
expresses 
the 
whole 
universe. 
In 
fact 
nothing 
can 
happen 
to 
us 
except 
thoughts 
and 
perceptions, 
and 
all 
our 
thoughts 
and 
perceptions 
are 
but 
the 
consequence, 
contingent 
it 
is 
true, 
of 
our 
precedent 
thoughts 
and 
perceptions, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
were 
I 
able 
to 
consider 
directly 
all 
that 
happens 
or 
appears 
to 
me 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
I 
should 
be 
able 
to 
see 
all 
that 
will 
happen 
to 
me 
or 
that 
will 
ever 
appear 
to 
me. 



This 
future 
will 
not 
fail 
me, 
and 
will 
surely 
appear 
to 
me 
even 
if 
all 
that 
which 
is 
outside 
of 
me 
were 
destroyed, 
save 
only 
that 
God 
and 
myself 
were 
left. 


Since, 
however, 
we 
ordinarily 
attribute 
to 
other 
things 
an 
action 
upon 
us 
which 
brings 
us 
to 
perceive 
things 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
consider 
thebasis 
ofthis 
judgmentand 
toinquirewhatthereisoftruthinit. 



XV. 
The 
action 
of 
one 
finite 
substance 
upon 
another 
consists 
only 
in 
the 
increase 
inthe 
degrees 
of 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
first 
combined 
with 
a 
decrease 
in 
that 
of 
the 
second, 
in 
so 
faras 
God 
has 
inadvance 
fashioned 
them 
so 
that 
theyshall 
act 
in 
accord. 



WITHOUT 
ENTERING 
INTO 
a 
long 
discussion 
it 
is 
sufficient 
for 
reconciling 
the 
language 
of 
metaphysics 
with 
that 
of 
practical 
life 
to 
remark 
that 
we 
preferably 
attribute 
to 
ourselves, 
and 
with 
reason, 
the 
phenomena 
which 
we 
express 
the 
most 
perfectly, 
and 
that 
we 
attribute 
to 
other 
substances 
those 
phenomena 
which 
each 
one 
expresses 
the 
best. 
Thus 
a 
substance, 
which 
is 
of 
an 
infinite 
extension 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
expresses 
all, 
becomes 
limited 
in 
proportionto 
its 
more 
or 
less 
perfect 
manner 
of 
expression. 
It 
is 
thus 
then 
that 
we 
may 
conceive 
of 
substances 
as 
interfering 
with 
and 
limiting 
one 
another, 
and 
hence 
we 
are 
able 
to 
say 
that 
in 
this 
sense 
they 
act 
upon 
one 
another, 
and 
that 
they, 
so 
to 
speak, 
accommodate 
themselves 
to 
one 
another. 
For 
it 
can 
happen 
that 
a 
single 
change 
which 
augments 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
one 
may 
diminish 
that 
of 
the 
other. 
Now 
the 
virtue 
of 
a 
particular 
substance 
is 
to 
express 
well 
the 
glory 
of 
God, 
and 
the 
better 
it 
expresses 
it, 
the 
less 
is 
it 
limited. 
Everything 
when 
it 
expresses 
its 
virtue 
or 
power, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
it 
acts, 
changes 
to 
better, 
and 
expands 
just 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
acts. 
When 
therefore 
a 
change 
occurs 
by 
which 
several 
substances 
are 
affected 
(in 
fact 
every 
change 
affects 
them 
all) 
I 
think 
we 
may 
say 
that 
those 
substances, 
which 
by 
this 
change 
pass 
immediately 
to 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
perfection, 
or 
to 
a 
more 
perfect 
expression, 
exert 
power 
and 
act, 
while 
those 
which 
pass 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree 
disclose 
their 
weakness 
and 
suffer. 
I 
also 
hold 
that 
every 
activity 
of 
a 
substances 
which 
has 
perception 
implies 
some 
pleasure, 
and 
every 
passion 
some 
pain, 
except 
that 
it 
may 
very 
well 
happen 
that 
a 
present 
advantage 
will 



be 
eventually 
destroyed 
by 
a 
greater 
evil, 
whence 
it 
comes 
that 
one 
may 
sin 
inactingorexertinghispower 
andin 
findingpleasure. 



XVI. 
The 
extraordinary 
intervention 
of 
God 
is 
not 
excluded 
in 
that 
which 
our 
particular 
essences 
express, 
because 
their 
expression 
includes 
everything. 
Such 
intervention, 
however, 
goesbeyond 
the 
power 
of 
our 
natural 
being 
or 
of 
our 
distinct 
expression, 
because 
these 
are 
finite, 
and 
follow 
certain 
subordinate 
regulations. 



THERE 
REMAINS 
FOR 
us 
at 
present 
only 
to 
explain 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
God 
has 
influence 
at 
times 
upon 
men 
or 
upon 
other 
substances 
by 
an 
extraordinary 
or 
miraculous 
intervention, 
since 
it 
seems 
that 
nothing 
is 
able 
to 
happen 
which 
is 
extraordinary 
or 
supernatural 
in 
as 
much 
as 
all 
the 
events 
which 
occur 
to 
the 
other 
substances 
are 
only 
the 
consequences 
of 
their 
natures. 
We 
must 
recall 
what 
was 
said 
above 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
miracles 
in 
the 
universe. 
These 
always 
conform 
to 
the 
universal 
law 
of 
the 
general 
order, 
although 
they 
may 
contravene 
the 
subordinate 
regulations, 
and 
since 
every 
person 
or 
substance 
is 
like 
a 
little 
world 
which 
expresses 
the 
great 
world, 
we 
can 
say 
that 
this 
extraordinary 
action 
of 
God 
upon 
this 
substance 
is 
nevertheless 
miraculous, 
although 
it 
is 
comprised 
in 
the 
general 
order 
of 
the 
universe 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
expressed 
by 
the 
individual 
essence 
or 
concept 
of 
this 
substance. 
This 
is 
why, 
if 
we 
understand 
in 
our 
natures 
all 
that 
they 
express, 
nothing 
is 
supernatural 
in 
them, 
because 
they 
reach 
out 
to 
everything, 
an 
effect 
always 
expressing 
its 
cause, 
and 
God 
being 
the 
veritable 
cause 
of 
the 
substances. 
But 
as 
that 
which 
our 
natures 
express 
the 
most 
perfectly 
pertains 
to 
them 
in 
a 
particular 
manner, 
that 
being 
their 
special 
power, 
and 
since 
they 
are 
limited, 
as 
I 
have 
just 
explained, 
many 
things 
there 
are 
which 
surpass 
the 
powers 
of 
our 
natures 
and 
even 
of 
all 
limited 
natures. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
to 
speak 
more 
clearly, 
I 
say 
that 
the 
miracles 
and 
the 



extraordinary 
interventions 
of 
God 
have 
this 
peculiarity 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
foreseen 
by 
any 
created 
mind 
however 
enlightened. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
distinct 
comprehension 
of 
the 
fundamental 
order 
surpasses 
them 
all, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
that 
which 
is 
called 
natural 
depends 
upon 
less 
fundamental 
regulations 
which 
the 
creatures 
are 
able 
to 
understand. 
In 
order 
then 
that 
my 
words 
may 
be 
as 
irreprehensible 
as 
the 
meaning 
I 
am 
trying 
to 
convey, 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
associate 
certain 
words 
with 
certain 
significations. 
We 
may 
call 
that 
which 
includes 
everything 
that 
we 
express 
and 
which 
expresses 
our 
unionwith 
God 
himself, 
nothing 
going 
beyond 
it, 
our 
essence. 
Butthat 
which 
is 
limited 
in 
us 
may 
be 
designated 
as 
our 
nature 
or 
our 
power 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
terminology 
that 
which 
goes 
beyond 
the 
natures 
of 
all 
createdsubstances 
issupernatural. 



XVII. 
An 
exampleof 
a 
subordinate 
regulation 
in 
the 
law 
of 
nature 
which 
demonstrates 
that 
God 
alwayspreserves 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
force 
but 
notthe 
same 
quantity 
of 
motion: 
— 
against 
the 
Cartesiansand 
many 
others. 



I 
HAVE 
FREQUENTLY 
spoken 
of 
subordinate 
regulations, 
or 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature, 
and 
it 
seems 
that 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
give 
an 
example. 
Our 
new 
philosophers 
are 
unanimous 
in 
employing 
that 
famous 
law 
that 
God 
always 
preserves 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
motion 
in 
the 
universe. 
In 
fact 
it 
is 
a 
very 
plausible 
law, 
and 
in 
times 
past 
I 
held 
it 
for 
indubitable. 
But 
since 
then 
I 
have 
learned 
in 
what 
its 
fault 
consists. 
Monsieur 
Descartes 
and 
many 
other 
clever 
mathematicians 
have 
thought 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
motion, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
the 


velocity 
multiplied 
by 
the 
mass 
[This 
term 
is 
employed 
here 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
clearness. 
Leibniz 
did 
not 
possess 
the 
concept 
“mass,” 
which 
was 
enunciated 
by 
Newton 
in 
the 
same 
year 
in 
which 
the 
present 
treatise 
was 
written, 
Leibniz 
uses 
the 
terms 
“body,” 
“magnitude 
of 
body,” 
etc. 
The 
technical 
expression 
“mass” 
occurs 
once 
only 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Leibniz 
(in 
a 
treatise 
published 
in 
), 
and 
was 
there 
doubtless 
borrowed 
from 
Newton. 
For 
the 
history 
of 
the 
controversy 
concerning 
the 
Cartesian 
and 
Leibnizian 
measure 
of 
force, 
see 
Mach’s 
Science 
of 
Mechanics, 
Chicago,, 
pp. 
et 
seq. 
— 
Trans.] 
of 
the 


moving 
body, 
is 
exactly 
equivalent 
to 
the 
moving 
force, 
or 
to 
speak 
in 
mathematical 
terms 
that 
the 
force 
varies 
as 
the 
velocity 
multiplied 
by 
the 
mass. 
Now 
it 
is 
reasonable 
that 
the 
same 
force 
is 
always 
preserved 
in 
the 
universe. 
So 
also, 
looking 
to 
phenomena, 
it 
will 
be 
readily 
seen 
that 
a 
mechanical 
perpetual 
motion 
is 
impossible, 
because 
the 
force 
in 
such 
a 
machine, 
being 
always 
diminished 
a 
little 
by 
friction 
and 
so 
ultimately 
destined 
to 
be 
entirely 
spent, 
would 
necessarily 
have 
to 
recoup 
its 
losses, 
and 
consequently 
would 
keep 
on 
increasing 
of 
itself 
without 
any 
new 
impulsion 
from 
without; 
and 
we 
see 
furthermore 
that 
the 
force 
of 
a 
body 
is 
diminished 
only 
in 
proportion 
as 
it 
gives 
up 
force, 
either 
to 
a 
contiguous 
body 
or 
to 
its 
ownparts,inso 
far 
astheyhave 
aseparatemovement. 
Themathematiciansto 



whom 
I 
have 
referred 
think 
that 
what 
can 
be 
said 
of 
force 
can 
be 
said 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
motion. 
In 
order, 
however, 
to 
show 
the 
difference 
I 
make 
two 
suppositions: 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
a 
body 
falling 
from 
a 
certain 
height 
acquires 
a 
force 
enabling 
it 
to 
remount 
to 
the 
same 
height, 
provided 
that 
its 
direction 
is 
turned 
that 
way, 
or 
provided 
that 
there 
are 
no 
hindrances. 
For 
instance, 
a 
pendulum 
will 
rise 
exactly 
to 
the 
height 
from 
which 
it 
has 
fallen, 
provided 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
and 
of 
certain 
other 
small 
particles 
do 
not 
diminish

XVIII. 
Thedistinction 
between 
force 
and 
the 
quantity 
of 
motion 
is, 
among 
other 
reasons, 
important 
as 
showing 
that 
we 
must 
have 
recourseto 
metaphysical 
considerations 
in 
addition 
to 
discussionsof 
extension 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
explain 
the 
phenomena 
ofmatter. 
THIS 
CONSIDERATION 
OF 
the 
force, 
distinguished 
from 
the 
quantity 
of 
motion 
is 
of 
importance, 
not 
only 
in 
physics 
and 
mechanics 
for 
finding 
the 
real 
laws 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
principles 
of 
motion, 
and 
even 
for 
correcting 
many 
practical 
errors 
which 
have 
crept 
into 
the 
writings 
of 
certain 
able 
mathematicians, 
but 
also 
in 
metaphysics 
it 
is 
of 
importance 
for 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
principles. 
Because 
motion, 
if 
we 
regard 
only 
its 
exact 
and 
formal 
meaning, 
that 
is, 
change 
of 
place, 
is 
not 
something 
entirely 
real, 
and 
when 
several 
bodies 
change 
their 
places 
reciprocally, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
determine 
by 
considering 
the 
bodies 
alone 
to 
which 
among 
them 
movement 
or 
repose 
is 
to 
be 
attributed, 
as 
I 
could 
demonstrate 
geometrically, 
if 
I 
wished 
to 
stop 
for 
it 
now. 
But 
the 
force, 
or 
the 
proximate 
cause 
of 
these 
changes 
is 
something 
more 
real, 
and 
there 
are 
sufficient 
grounds 
for 
attributing 
it 
to 
one 
body 
rather 
than 
to 
another, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
through 
this 
latter 
investigation 
that 
we 
can 
determine 
to 
which 
one 
the 
movement 
must 
appertain. 
Now 
this 
force 
is 
something 
different 
from 
size, 
from 
form 
or 
from 
motion, 
and 
it 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
this 
consideration 
that 
the 
whole 
meaning 
of 
a 
body 
is 
not 
exhausted 
in 
its 
extension 
together 
with 
its 
modifications 
as 
our 
moderns 
persuade 
themselves. 
We 
are 
therefore 
obliged 
to 
restore 
certain 
beings 
or 
forms 
which 
they 
have 
banished. 
It 
appears 
more 
and 
more 
clear 
that 
although 
all 
the 
particular 
phenomena 
of 
nature 
can 
be 
explained 
mathematically 
or 
mechanically 
by 
those 
who 
understand 
them, 
yet 



nevertheless, 
the 
general 
principles 
of 
corporeal 
nature 
and 
even 
of 
mechanics 
are 
metaphysical 
rather 
than 
geometric, 
and 
belong 
rather 
to 
certain 
indivisible 
forms 
or 
natures 
as 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
appearances, 
than 
to 
the 
corporeal 
mass 
or 
to 
extension. 
This 
reflection 
is 
able 
to 
reconcile 
the 
mechanical 
philosophy 
of 
the 
moderns 
with 
the 
circumspection 
of 
those 
intelligent 
and 
well-meaning 
persons 
who, 
with 
a 
certain 
justice, 
fear 
that 
we 
are 
becoming 
too 
far 
removed 
from 
immaterial 
beings 
and 
that 
we 
are 
thus 
prejudicingpiety. 



XIX. 
The 
utility 
of 
final 
causes 
in 
Physics. 
AS 
I 
DO 
not 
wish 
to 
judge 
people 
in 
ill 
part 
I 
bring 
no 
accusation 
against 
our 
new 
philosophers 
who 
pretend 
to 
banish 
final 
causes 
from 
physics, 
but 
I 
am 
nevertheless 
obliged 
to 
avow 
that 
the 
consequences 
of 
such 
a 
banishment 
appear 
to 
me 
dangerous, 
especially 
when 
joined 
to 
that 
position 
which 
I 
refuted 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
treatise. 
That 
position 
seemed 
to 
go 
the 
length 
of 
discarding 
final 
causes 
entirely 
as 
though 
God 
proposed 
no 
end 
and 
no 
good 
in 
his 
activity, 
or 
as 
if 
good 
were 
not 
to 
be 
the 
object 
of 
his 
will. 
I 
hold 
on 
the 
contrary 
that 
it 
is 
just 
in 
this 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
all 
existences 
and 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
must 
be 
sought, 
hence 
God 
always 
proposes 
the 
best 
and 
most 
perfect. 
I 
am 
quite 
willing 
to 
grant 
that 
we 
are 
liable 
to 
err 
when 
we 
wish 
to 
determine 
the 
purposes 
or 
councils 
of 
God, 
but 
this 
is 
the 
case 
only 
when 
we 
try 
to 
limit 
them 
to 
some 
particular 
design, 
thinking 
that 
he 
has 
had 
inview 
onlya 
singlething, 
whileinfacthe 
regards 
everythingat 
once. 
Asfor 
instance, 
if 
we 
think 
that 
God 
has 
made 
the 
world 
only 
for 
us, 
it 
is 
a 
great 
blunder, 
although 
it 
may 
be 
quite 
true 
that 
he 
has 
made 
it 
entirely 
for 
us, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
universe 
which 
does 
not 
touch 
us 
and 
which 
does 
not 
accommodate 
itself 
to 
the 
regard 
which 
he 
has 
for 
us 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
laid 
down 
above. 
Therefore 
when 
we 
see 
some 
good 
effect 
or 
some 
perfection 
which 
happens 
or 
which 
follows 
from 
the 
works 
of 
God 
we 
are 
able 
to 
say 
assuredly 
that 
God 
has 
purposed 
it, 
for 
he 
does 
nothing 
by 
chance, 
and 
is 
not 
like 
us 
who 
sometimes 
fail 
to 
do 
well. 
Therefore, 
far 
from 
being 
able 
to 
fall 
into 
error 
in 
this 
respect 
as 
do 
the 
extreme 
statesmen 
who 
postulate 
too 
much 
foresight 
in 
the 
designs 
of 
Princes, 
or 
as 
do 
commentators 
who 
seek 
for 
too 
much 
erudition 
in 
their 
authors, 
it 
will 
be 
impossible 
to 



attribute 
too 
much 
reflection 
to 
God’s 
infinite 
wisdom, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
matter 
in 
which 
error 
is 
less 
to 
be 
feared 
provided 
we 
confine 
ourselves 
to 
affirmations 
and 
provided 
we 
avoid 
negative 
statements 
which 
limit 
the 
designs 
of 
God. 
All 
those 
who 
see 
the 
admirable 
structure 
of 
animals 
find 
themselves 
led 
to 
recognize 
the 
wisdom 
of 
the 
author 
of 
things 
and 
I 
advise 
those 
who 
have 
any 
sentiment 
of 
piety 
and 
indeed 
of 
true 
philosophy 
to 
hold 
aloof 
from 
the 
expressions 
of 
certain 
pretentious 
minds 
who 
instead 
of 
saying 
that 
eyes 
were 
made 
for 
seeing, 
say 
that 
we 
see 
because 
we 
find 
ourselves 
having 
eyes. 
When 
one 
seriously 
holds 
such 
opinions 
which 
hand 
everything 
over 
to 
material 
necessity 
or 
to 
a 
kind 
of 
chance 
(although 
either 
alternative 
ought 
to 
appear 
ridiculous 
to 
those 
who 
understand 
what 
we 
have 
explained 
above) 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
recognize 
an 
intelligent 
author 
of 
nature. 
The 
effect 
should 
correspond 
to 
its 
cause 
and 
indeed 
it 
is 
best 
known 
through 
the 
recognition 
of 
its 
cause, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
introduce 
a 
sovereign 
intelligence 
ordering 
things, 
and 
in 
place 
of 
making 
use 
of 
the 
wisdom 
of 
this 
sovereign 
being, 
to 
employ 
only 
the 
properties 
of 
matter 
to 
explain 
phenomena. 
As 
if 
in 
order 
to 
account 
for 
the 
capture 
of 
an 
important 
place 
by 
a 
prince,the 
historian 
shouldsay 
it 
was 
because 
theparticlesof 
powder 
inthe 
cannon 
having 
been 
touched 
by 
a 
spark 
of 
fire 
expanded 
with 
a 
rapidity 
capable 
of 
pushing 
a 
hard 
solid 
body 
against 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
place, 
while 
the 
little 
particles 
which 
composed 
the 
brass 
of 
the 
cannon 
were 
so 
well 
interlaced 
that 
they 
did 
not 
separate 
under 
this 
impact, 
— 
as 
if 
he 
should 
account 
for 
it 
in 
this 
way 
instead 
of 
making 
us 
see 
how 
the 
foresight 
of 
the 
conqueror 
brought 
him 
to 
choose 
the 
time 
and 
the 
proper 
means 
and 
how 
his 
abilitysurmounted 
allobstacles.

A 
noteworthy 
disquisition 
in

THIS 
REMINDS 
ME 
of 
a 
fine 
disquisition 
by 
Socrates 
in 
Plato’s 
Phaedo, 
which 
agrees 
perfectly 
with 
my 
opinion 
on 
this 
subject 
and 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
uttered 
expressly 
for 
our 
too 
materialistic 
philosophers. 
This 
agreement 
has 
led 
me 
to 
a 
desire 
to 
translate 
it 
although 
it 
is 
a 
little 
long. 
Perhaps 
this 
example 
will 
give 
some 
of 
us 
an 
incentive 
to 
share 
in 
many 
of 
the 
other 
beautiful 
and 
well 
balanced 
thoughts 
which 
are 
found 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
this 
famous 
author.[There

If 
the 
mechanical 
laws 
depended 
upon 
Geometry 
alone 
without 
metaphysical 
influences, 
the 
phenomena 
would 
be 
very 
different 
from 
what 
theyare. 



NOW 
SINCE 
THE 
wisdom 
of 
God 
has 
always 
been 
recognized 
in 
the 
detail 
of 
the 
mechanical 
structures 
of 
certain 
particular 
bodies, 
it 
should 
also 
be 
shown 
in 
thegeneral 
economyof 
the 
world 
and 
in 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature. 
This 
is 
so 
true 
that 
even 
in 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
in 
general, 
the 
plans 
of 
this 
wisdom 
have 
been 
noticed. 
For 
if 
bodies 
were 
only 
extended 
masses, 
and 
motion 
were 
only 
a 
change 
of 
place, 
and 
if 
everything 
ought 
to 
be 
and 
could 
be 
deduced 
by 
geometric 
necessity 
from 
these 
two 
definitions 
alone, 
it 
would 
follow, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere, 
that 
the 
smallest 
body 
on 
contact 
with 
a 
very 
large 
one 
at 
rest 
would 
impart 
to 
it 
its 
own 
velocity, 
yet 
without 
losing 
any 
of 
the 
velocity 
that 
it 
had. 
A 
quantity 
of 
other 
rules 
wholly 
contrary 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
system 
would 
also 
have 
to 
be 
admitted. 
But 
the 
decree 
of 
the 
divine 
wisdom 
in 
preserving 
always 
the 
same 
force 
and 
the 
same 
total 
direction 
has 
provided 
for 
a 
system. 
I 
find 
indeed 
that 
many 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
nature 
can 
be 
accounted 
for 
in 
a 
twofold 
way, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
by 
a 
consideration 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
and 
again 
independently 
by 
a 
consideration 
of 
final 
causes. 
An 
example 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
God’s 
decree 
to 
always 
carry 
out 
his 
plan 
by 
the 
easiest 
and 
most 
determined 
way. 
I 
have 
shown 
this 
elsewhere 
in 
accounting 
for 
the 
catoptric 
and 
dioptric 
laws, 
and 
I 
will 
speak 
more 
at 
length 
aboutitinwhat 
follows. 



XXII. 
Reconciliation 
of 
the 
two 
methods 
of 
explanation, 
the 
one 
using 
final 
causes, 
and 
the 
other 
efficientcauses, 
thus 
satisfying 
both 
those 
who 
explain 
nature 
mechanically 
and 
those 
who 
have 
recourse 
to 
incorporealnatures. 



IT 
IS 
WORTH 
while 
to 
make 
the 
preceding 
remark 
in 
order 
to 
reconcile 
those 
who 
hope 
to 
explain 
mechanically 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
first 
tissue 
of 
an 
animal 
and 
all 
the 
interrelation 
of 
the 
parts, 
with 
those 
who 
account 
for 
the 
same 
structure 
by 
referring 
to 
final 
causes. 
Both 
explanations 
are 
good; 
both 
are 
useful 
not 
only 
for 
the 
admiring 
of 
the 
work 
of 
a 
great 
artificer, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
discovery 
of 
useful 
facts 
in 
physics 
and 
medicine. 
And 
writers 
who 
take 
these 
diverse 
routes 
should 
not 
speak 
ill 
of 
each 
other. 
For 
I 
see 
that 
those 
who 
attempt 
to 
explain 
beauty 
by 
the 
divine 
anatomy 
ridicule 
those 
who 
imagine 
that 
the 
apparently 
fortuitous 
flow 
of 
certain 
liquids 
has 
been 
able 
to 
produce 
such 
a 
beautiful 
varietyand 
that 
theyregardthem 
as 
overbold 
and 
irreverent. 
These 
others 
on 
the 
contrary 
treat 
the 
former 
as 
simple 
and 
superstitious, 
and 
compare 
them 
to 
those 
ancients 
who 
regarded 
the 
physicists 
as 
impious 
when 
they 
maintained 
that 
not 
Jupiter 
thundered 
but 
some 
material 
which 
is 
found 
in 
the 
clouds. 
The 
best 
plan 
would 
be 
to 
join 
the 
two 
ways 
of 
thinking. 
To 
use 
a 
practical 
comparison, 
we 
recognize 
and 
praise 
the 
ability 
of 
a 
workman 
not 
only 
when 
we 
show 
what 
designs 
he 
had 
in 
making 
the 
parts 
of 
his 
machine, 
but 
also 
when 
we 
explain 
the 
instruments 
which 
he 
employed 
in 
making 
each 
part, 
above 
all 
if 
these 
instruments 
are 
simple 
and 
ingeniously 
contrived. 
God 
is 
also 
a 
workman 
able 
enough 
to 
produce 
a 
machine 
still 
a 
thousand 
times 
more 
ingenious 
than 
is 
our 
body, 
by 
employing 
only 
certain 
quite 
simple 
liquids 
purposely 
composed 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
ordinary 
laws 
of 
nature 
alone 
are 
required 
to 
develop 
them 
so 
as 
to 



produce 
such 
a 
marvellous 
effect. 
But 
it 
is 
also 
true 
that 
this 
development 
would 
not 
take 
place 
if 
God 
were 
not 
the 
author 
of 
nature. 
Yet 
I 
find 
that 
the 
methodofefficient 
causes,whichgoes 
much 
deeperand 
is 
in 
a 
measure 
more 
immediate 
and 
a 
priori, 
is 
also 
more 
difficult 
when 
we 
come 
to 
details, 
and 
I 
think 
that 
our 
philosophers 
are 
still 
very 
frequently 
far 
removed 
from 
making 
the 
most 
of 
this 
method. 
The 
method 
of 
final 
causes, 
however, 
is 
easier 
and 
can 
be 
frequently 
employed 
to 
find 
out 
important 
and 
useful 
truths 
which 
we 
should 
have 
to 
seek 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
if 
we 
were 
confined 
to 
that 
other 
more 
physical 
method 
of 
which 
anatomy 
is 
able 
to 
furnish 
many 
examples. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
Snellius, 
who 
was 
the 
first 
discoverer 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
refraction 
would 
have 
waited 
a 
long 
time 
before 
finding 
them 
if 
he 
had 
wished 
to 
seek 
out 
first 
how 
light 
was 
formed. 
But 
he 
apparently 
followed 
that 
method 
which 
the 
ancients 
employed 
for 
Catoptrics, 
that 
is, 
the 
method 
of 
final 
causes. 
Because, 
while 
seeking 
for 
the 
easiest 
way 
in 
which 
to 
conduct 
a 
ray 
of 
light 
from 
one 
given 
point 
to 
another 
given 
point 
by 
reflection 
from 
a 
given 
plane 
(supposing 
that 
that 
was 
the 
design 
of 
nature) 
they 
discovered 
the 
equality 
of 
the 
angles 
of 
incidence 
and 
reflection, 
as 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
a 
little 
treatise 
by 
Heliodorus 
of 
Larissa 
and 
also 
elsewhere. 
This 
principle 
Mons. 
Snellius, 
I 
believe, 
and 
afterwards 
independently 
of 
him, 
M. 
Fermat, 
applied 
most 
ingeniously 
to 
refraction. 
For 
since 
the 
rays 
while 
in 
the 
same 
media 
always 
maintain 
the 
same 
proportion 
of 
sines, 
which 
in 
turn 
corresponds 
to 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
media, 
it 
appears 
that 
they 
follow 
the 
easiest 
way, 
or 
at 
least 
that 
way 
which 
is 
the 
most 
determinate 
for 
passing 
from 
a 
given 
point 
in 
one 
medium 
to 
a 
given 
point 
in 
another 
medium. 
That 
demonstration 
of 
this 
same 
theorem 
which 
M. 
Descartes 
has 
given, 
using 
efficient 
causes, 
is 
much 
less 
satisfactory. 
At 
least 
we 
have 
grounds 
to 
think 
that 
he 
would 
never 
have 
found 
the 
principle 
by 
that 
means 
if 
he 
had 
not 
learnedinHollandofthediscoveryofSnellius. 



XXIII. 
Returning 
to 
immaterialsubstances 
we 
explain 
how 
God 
acts 
upon 
the 
understanding 
of 
spirits 
and 
ask 
whether 
one 
always 
keeps 
the 
idea 
of 
what 
he 
thinksabout. 



I 
HAVE 
THOUGHT 
it 
well 
to 
insist 
a 
little 
upon 
final 
causes, 
upon 
incorporeal 
natures 
and 
upon 
an 
intelligent 
cause 
with 
respect 
to 
bodies 
so 
as 
to 
show 
the 
use 
of 
these 
conceptions 
in 
physics 
and 
in 
mathematics. 
This 
for 
two 
reasons, 
first 
to 
purge 
from 
mechanical 
philosophy 
the 
impiety 
that 
is 
imputed 
to 
it, 
second, 
to 
elevate 
to 
nobler 
lines 
of 
thought 
the 
thinking 
of 
our 
philosophers 
who 
incline 
to 
materialistic 
considerations 
alone. 
Now, 
however, 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
return 
from 
corporeal 
substances 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
immaterial 
natures 
and 
particularly 
of 
spirits, 
and 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
methods 
which 
God 
uses 
to 
enlighten 
them 
and 
to 
act 
upon 
them. 
Although 
we 
must 
not 
forget 
that 
there 
are 
here 
at 
the 
same 
time 
certain 
laws 
of 
nature 
in 
regard 
to 
which 
I 
can 
speak 
more 
amply 
elsewhere. 
It 
will 
be 
enough 
for 
now 
to 
touch 
upon 
ideas 
and 
to 
inquire 
if 
we 
see 
everything 
in 
God 
and 
how 
God 
is 
our 
light. 
First 
of 
all 
it 
will 
be 
in 
place 
to 
remark 
that 
the 
wrong 
use 
of 
ideas 
occasions 
many 
errors. 
For 
when 
one 
reasons 
in 
regard 
to 
anything, 
he 
imagines 
that 
he 
has 
an 
idea 
of 
it 
and 
this 
is 
the 
foundation 
upon 
which 
certain 
philosophers, 
ancient 
and 
modern, 
have 
constructed 
a 
demonstration 
of 
God 
that 
is 
extremely 
imperfect. 
It 
must 
be, 
they 
say, 
that 
I 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
God, 
or 
of 
a 
perfect 
being, 
since 
I 
think 
of 
him 
and 
we 
cannot 
think 
without 
having 
ideas; 
now 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
being 
includes 
all 
perfections 
and 
since 
existence 
is 
one 
of 
these 
perfections, 
it 
follows 
that 
he 
exists. 
But 
I 
reply, 
inasmuch 
as 
we 
often 
think 
of 
impossible 
chimeras, 
for 
example 
of 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
swiftness, 
ofthegreatest 
number, 
ofthemeeting 
oftheconchoidwith 
itsbase 
or 
determinant, 
such 
reasoning 
is 
not 
sufficient. 
It 
is 
therefore 
in 
this 
sense 



that 
we 
can 
say 
that 
there 
are 
true 
and 
false 
ideas 
according 
as 
the 
thing 
which 
is 
in 
question 
is 
possible 
or 
not. 
And 
it 
is 
when 
he 
is 
assured 
of 
the 
possibilityof 
a 
thing, 
that 
one 
can 
boast 
ofhaving 
an 
idea 
ofit. 
Therefore, 
the 
aforesaid 
argument 
proves 
that 
God 
exists, 
if 
he 
is 
possible. 
This 
is 
in 
fact 
an 
excellent 
privilege 
of 
the 
divine 
nature, 
to 
have 
need 
only 
of 
a 
possibility 
or 
anessencein 
ordertoactually 
exist,and

XXIV. 
What 
clear 
and 
obscure, 
distinct 
and 
confused, 
adequate 
and 
inadequate, 
intuitive 
and 
assumed 
knowledge 
is, 
andthe 
definition 
of 
nominal, 
real, 
causal 
and 
essential. 



IN 
ORDER 
TO 
understand 
better 
the 
nature 
of 
ideas 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
touch 
somewhatupon 
the 
various 
kinds 
of 
knowledge. 
When 
I 
am 
able 
to 
recognize 
a 
thing 
among 
others, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
say 
in 
what 
its 
differences 
or 
characteristics 
consist, 
the 
knowledgeis 
confused. 
Sometimes 
indeed 
we 
may 
know 
clearly, 
that 
is 
without 
being 
in 
the 
slightest 
doubt, 
that 
a 
poem 
or 
a 
picture 
is 
well 
or 
badly 
done 
because 
there 
is 
in 
it 
an 
“I 
know 
not 
what” 
which 
satisfies 
or 
shocks 
us. 
Such 
knowledge 
is 
not 
yet 
distinct. 
It 
is 
when 
I 
am 
able 
to 
explain 
the 
peculiarities 
which 
a 
thing 
has, 
that 
the 
knowledge 
is 
called 
distinct. 
Such 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
an 
assayer 
who 
discerns 
the 
true 
gold 
from 
the 
false 
by 
means 
of 
certain 
proofs 
or 
marks 
which 
make 
up 
the 
definition 
of 
gold. 
But 
distinct 
knowledge 
has 
degrees, 
because 
ordinarily 
the 
conceptions 
which 
enter 
into 
the 
definitions 
will 
themselves 
have 
need 
of 
definition, 
and 
are 
only 
known 
confusedly. 
When 
at 
length 
everything 
which 
enters 
into 
a 
definition 
or 
into 
distinct 
knowledge 
is 
known 
distinctly, 
even 
back 
to 
the 
primitive 
conception, 
I 
call 
that 
knowledge 
adequate. 
When 
my 
mind 
understands 
at 
once 
and 
distinctly 
all 
the 
primitive 
ingredients 
of 
a 
conception, 
then 
we 
have 
intuitive 
knowledge. 
This 
is 
extremely 
rare 
as 
most 
human 
knowledge 
is 
only 
confused 
or 
indeed 
assumed. 
It 
is 
well 
also 
to 
distinguish 
nominal 
from 
real 
definition. 
I 
call 
a 
definition 
nominal 
when 
there 
is 
doubt 
whether 
an 
exact 
conception 
of 
it 
is 
possible; 
as 
for 
instance, 
when 
I 
say 
that 
an 
endless 
screw 
is 
a 
line 
in 
three 
dimensional 
space 
whose 
parts 
are 
congruent 
or 
fall 
one 
upon 
another. 
Now 
although 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
reciprocal 
properties 
of 
an 
endless 
screw, 
he 
who 
did 
not 
know 
from 



elsewhere 
what 
an 
endless 
screw 
was 
could 
doubt 
if 
such 
a 
line 
were 
possible, 
because 
the 
other 
lines 
whose 
ends 
are 
congruent 
(there 
are 
only 
two: 
the 
circumference 
of 
a 
circle 
and 
the 
straight 
line) 
are 
plane 
figures, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
they 
can 
be 
described 
in 
plano. 
This 
instance 
enables 
us 
to 
see 
that 
any 
reciprocal 
property 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
nominal 
definition, 
but 
when 
the 
property 
brings 
us 
to 
see 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
thing 
it 
makes 
the 
definition 
real, 
and 
as 
long 
as 
one 
has 
only 
a 
nominal 
definition 
he 
cannot 
be 
sure 
of 
the 
consequences 
which 
he 
draws, 
because 
if 
it 
conceals 
a 
contradiction 
or 
an 
impossibility 
he 
would 
be 
able 
to 
draw 
the 
opposite 
conclusions. 
That 
is 
why 
truths 
do 
not 
depend 
upon 
names 
and 
are 
not 
arbitrary, 
as 
some 
of 
our 
new 
philosophers 
think. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
considerable 
difference 
among 
real 
definitions, 
for 
when 
the 
possibility 
proves 
itself 
only 
by 
experience, 
as 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
quicksilver, 
whose 
possibility 
we 
know 
because 
such 
a 
body, 
which 
is 
both 
an 
extremely 
heavy 
fluid 
and 
quite 
volatile, 
actually 
exists, 
the 
definition 
is 
merely 
real 
and 
nothing 
more. 
If, 
however, 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
possibility 
is 
a 
priori, 
the 
definition 
is 
not 
only 
real 
but 
also 
causal 
as 
for 
instance 
when 
it 
contains 
the 
possible 
generation 
of 
a 
thing. 
Finally 
when 
the 
definition, 
without 
assuming 
anything 
which 
requires 
a 
proof 
a 
priori 
of 
its 
possibility, 
carries 
the 
analysis 
clear 
to 
the 
primitive 
conception, 
the 
definitionis 
perfect 
oressential. 



XXV. 
In 
what 
cases 
knowledge 
is 
added 
to 
mere 
contemplation 
ofthe 
idea. 



NOW 
IT 
IS 
manifest 
that 
we 
have 
no 
idea 
of 
a 
conception 
when 
it 
is 
impossible. 
And 
in 
case 
the 
knowledge, 
where 
we 
have 
the 
idea 
of 
it, 
is 
only 
assumed, 
we 
do 
not 
visualize 
it 
because 
such 
a 
conception 
is 
known 
only 
in 
like 
mannerasconceptions 
internallyimpossible. 
And 
if 
it 
be 
in 
fact 
possible, 
it 
is 
not 
by 
this 
kind 
of 
knowledge 
that 
we 
learn 
its 
possibility. 
For 
instance, 
when 
I 
am 
thinking 
of 
a 
thousand 
or 
of 
a 
chiliagon, 
I 
frequently 
do 
it 
without 
contemplating 
the 
idea. 
Even 
if 
I 
say 
a 
thousand 
is 
ten 
times 
a 
hundred, 
I 
frequently 
do 
not 
trouble 
to 
think 
what 
ten 
and 
a 
hundred 
are, 
because 
I 
assume 
that 
I 
know, 
and 
I 
do 
not 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
stop 
just 
at 
present 
to 
conceive 
of 
them. 
Therefore 
it 
may 
well 
happen, 
as 
it 
in 
fact 
does 
happen 
often 
enough, 
that 
I 
am 
mistaken 
in 
regard 
to 
a 
conception 
which 
I 
assume 
that 
I 
understand, 
although 
it 
is 
an 
impossible 
truth 
or 
at 
least 
is 
incompatible 
with 
others 
with 
which 
I 
join 
it, 
and 
whether 
I 
am 
mistaken 
or 
not, 
this 
way 
of 
assuming 
our 
knowledge 
remains 
the 
same. 
It 
is, 
then, 
only 
when 
our 
knowledge 
is 
clear 
in 
regard 
to 
confused 
conceptions, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
intuitive 
inregardtothosewhichare

XXVI. 
Ideasare 
all 
stored 
up 
within 
us. 
Plato’sdoctrine 
of 
reminiscence. 
IN 
ORDER 
TO 
see 
clearly 
what 
an 
idea 
is, 
we 
must 
guard 
ourselves 
against 
a 
misunderstanding. 
Many 
regard 
the 
idea 
as 
the 
form 
or 
the 
differentiation 
of 
our 
thinking, 
and 
according 
to 
this 
opinion 
we 
have 
the 
idea 
in 
our 
mind, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
we 
are 
thinking 
of 
it, 
and 
each 
separate 
time 
that 
we 
think 
of 
it 
anew 
we 
have 
another 
idea 
although 
similar 
to 
the 
preceding 
one. 
Some, 
however, 
take 
the 
idea 
as 
the 
immediate 
object 
of 
thought, 
or 
as 
a 
permanent 
form 
which 
remains 
even 
when 
we 
are 
no 
longer 
contemplating 
it. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
our 
soul 
has 
the 
power 
of 
representing 
to 
itself 
any 
form 
or 
nature 
whenever 
the 
occasion 
comes 
for 
thinking 
about 
it, 
and 
I 
think 
that 
this 
activity 
of 
our 
soul 
is, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
expresses 
some 
nature, 
form 
or 
essence, 
properly 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
thing. 
This 
is 
in 
us, 
and 
is 
always 
in 
us, 
whether 
we 
are 
thinking 
of 
it 
or 
no. 
(Our 
soul 
expresses 
God 
and 
the 
universe 
and 
all 
essences 
as 
well 
as 
all 
existences.) 
This 
position 
is 
in 
accord 
with 
my 
principlesthatnaturallynothingentersintoourminds 
fromoutside. 


It 
is 
a 
bad 
habit 
we 
have 
of 
thinking 
as 
though 
our 
minds 
receive 
certain 
messengers, 
as 
it 
were, 
or 
as 
if 
they 
had 
doors 
or 
windows. 
We 
have 
in 
our 
minds 
all 
those 
forms 
for 
all 
periods 
of 
time 
because 
the 
mind 
at 
every 
moment 
expresses 
all 
its 
future 
thoughts 
and 
already 
thinks 
confusedly 
of 
all 
that 
of 
which 
it 
will 
ever 
think 
distinctly. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
taught 
us 
of 
which 
we 
have 
not 
already 
in 
our 
minds 
the 
idea. 
This 
idea 
is 
as 
it 
were 
the 
material 
out 
of 
which 
the 
thought 
will 
form 
itself. 
This 
is 
what 
Plato 
has 
excellently 
brought 
out 
in 
his 
doctrine 
of 
reminiscence, 
a 
doctrine 
which 
contains 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
truth, 
provided 
that 
it 
is 
properly 
understood 
and 
purged 
of 
the 
error 
of 
pre-existence, 
and 
provided 
that 
one 
does 
not 
conceive 
of 
the 
soul 
as 



having 
already 
known 
and 
thought 
at 
some 
other 
time 
what 
it 
learns 
and 
thinks 
now. 
Plato 
has 
also 
confirmed 
his 
position 
by 
a 
beautiful 
experiment. 
He 
introduces 
a 
small 
boy, 
whom 
he 
leads 
by 
short 
steps, 
to 
extremely 
difficult 
truths 
of 
geometry 
bearing 
on 
incommensurables, 
all 
this 
without 
teaching 
the 
boy 
anything, 
merely 
drawing 
out 
replies 
by 
a 
well 
arranged 
series 
of 
questions. 
This 
shows 
that 
the 
soul 
virtually 
knows 
those 
things, 
and 
needs 
only 
to 
be 
reminded 
(animadverted) 
to 
recognize 
the 
truths. 
Consequently 
it 
possesses 
at 
least 
the 
idea 
upon 
which 
those 
truths 
depend. 
We 
may 
say 
even 
that 
it 
already 
possesses 
those 
truths, 
if 
we 
consider 
them 
astherelations 
oftheideas. 



XXVII. 
In 
what 
respect 
our 
soulscan 
becompared 
to 
blank 
tablets 
and 
how 
conceptions 
are 
derived 
from 
the 
senses. 
ARISTOTLE 
PREFERRED 
TO 
compare 
our 
souls 
to 
blank 
tablets 
prepared 
for 
writing, 
and 
he 
maintained 
that 
nothing 
is 
in 
the 
understanding 
which 
does 
not 
come 
through 
the 
senses. 
This 
position 
is 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
popular 
conceptions 
as 
Aristotle’s 
positions 
usually 
are. 
Plato 
thinks 
more 
profoundly. 
Such 
tenets 
or 
practicologies 
are 
nevertheless 
allowable 
in 
ordinary 
use 
somewhat 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
those 
who 
accept 
the 
Copernican 
theory 
still 
continue 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
rising 
and 
setting 
of 
the 
sun. 
I 
find 
indeed 
that 
these 
usages 
can 
be 
given 
a 
real 
meaning 
containing 
no 
error, 
quite 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
I 
have 
already 
pointed 
out 
that 
we 
may 
truly 
say 
particular 
substances 
act 
upon 
one 
another. 
In 
this 
same 
sense 
we 
may 
say 
that 
knowledge 
is 
received 
from 
without 
through 
the 
medium 
of 
the 
senses 
becausecertainexterior 
thingscontainor 
express 
more 
particularly 
the 
causes 
which 
determine 
us 
to 
certain 
thoughts. 
Because 
in 
the 
ordinary 
uses 
of 
life 
we 
attribute 
to 
the 
soul 
only 
that 
which 
belongs 
to 
it 
most 
manifestly 
and 
particularly, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
advantage 
in 
going 
further. 
When, 
however, 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
exactness 
of 
metaphysical 
truths, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
recognize 
the 
powers 
and 
independence 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
extend 
infinitely 
further 
than 
is 
commonly 
supposed. 
In 
order, 
therefore, 
to 
avoid 
misunderstandings 
it 
would 
be 
well 
to 
choose 
separate 
terms 
for 
the 
two. 
These 
expressions 
which 
are 
in 
the 
soul 
whether 
one 
is 
conceiving 
of 
them 
or 
not 
may 
be 
called 
ideas, 
while 
those 
which 
one 
conceives 
of 
or 
constructs 
may 
be 
called 
conceptions, 
conceptus. 
But 
whatever 
terms 
are 
used, 
it 
is 
always 
false 
to 
say 
that 
all 
our 
conceptions 
come 
from 
the 
so-called 
external 
senses, 
because 
those 
conceptions 
which 
I 
have 
of 
myself 
and 
of 
my 



thoughts, 
and 
consequently 
of 
being, 
of 
substance, 
of 
action, 
of 
identity, 
and 
ofmanyotherscame 
fromaninnerexperience. 



XXVIII. 
The 
only 
immediate 
object 
of 
our 
perceptionswhich 
exists 
outside 
of 
us 
is 
God, 
and 
in 
him 
alone 
isour 
light. 
IN 
THE 
STRICTLY 
metaphysical 
sense 
no 
external 
cause 
acts 
upon 
us 
excepting 
God 
alone, 
and 
he 
is 
in 
immediate 
relation 
with 
us 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
our 
continual 
dependence 
upon 
him. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
there 
is 
absolutely 
no 
other 
external 
object 
which 
comes 
into 
contact 
with 
our 
souls 
and 
directly 
excites 
perceptions 
in 
us. 
We 
have 
in 
our 
souls 
ideas 
of 
everything, 
only 
because 
of 
the 
continual 
action 
of 
God 
upon 
us, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
because 
every 
effect 
expresses 
its 
cause 
and 
therefore 
theessencesof 
our 
souls 
are 
certain 
expressions, 
imitations 
or 
images 
of 
the 
divine 
essence, 
divine 
thought 
and 
divine 
will, 
including 
all 
the 
ideas 
which 
are 
there 
contained. 
We 
may 
say, 
therefore, 
that 
God 
is 
for 
us 
the 
only 
immediate 
external 
object, 
and 
that 
we 
see 
things 
through 
him. 
For 
example, 
when 
we 
seethesun 
orthestars,itisGod 
who 
givesto 
us 
and 
preservesin 
us 
the 
ideas 
and 
whenever 
our 
senses 
are 
affected 
according 
to 
his 
own 
laws 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
it 
is 
he, 
who 
by 
his 
continual 
concurrence, 
determines 
our 
thinking. 
God 
is 
the 
sun 
and 
the 
light 
of 
souls, 
lumen 
illuminans 
omnem 
hominem 
venientem 
in 
hunc 
mundum, 
although 
this 
is 
not 
the 
current 
conception. 
I 
thinkIhavealreadyremarkedthat 
duringthescholasticperiodmanybelieved 
God 
to 
be 
the 
light 
of 
the 
soul, 
intellectus 
agens 
animæ 
rationalis, 
following 
in 
this 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures 
and 
the 
fathers 
who 
were 
always 
more 
Platonic 
than 
Aristotelian 
in 
their 
mode 
of 
thinking. 
The 
Averroists 
misused 
this 
conception, 
but 
others, 
among 
whom 
were 
several 
mystic 
theologians, 
and 
William 
of 
Saint 
Amour, 
also 
I 
think, 
understood 
this 
conception 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
assured 
the 
dignity 
of 
God 
and 
was 
able 
to 
raise 
the 
soul 
to 
a 
knowledge 
ofitswelfare. 



XXIX. 
Yet 
we 
think 
directly 
by 
means 
ofour 
ownideas 
and 
not 
through 
God’s. 



NEVERTHELESS 
I 
CANNOT 
approve 
of 
the 
position 
of 
certain 
able 
philosophers 
who 
seem 
to 
hold 
that 
our 
ideas 
themselves 
are 
in 
God 
and 
not 
at 
all 
in 
us. 
I 
think 
that 
in 
taking 
this 
position 
they 
have 
neither 
sufficiently 
considered 
the 
nature 
of 
substance, 
which 
we 
have 
just 
explained, 
nor 
the 
entire 
extension 
and 
independence 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
includes 
all 
that 
happens 
to 
it, 
and 
expresses 
God, 
and 
with 
him 
all 
possible 
and 
actual 
beings 
in 
the 
samewaythatan 
effect 
expresses 
itscause. 
It 
is 
indeed 
inconceivablethatthe 
soul 
should 
think 
using 
the 
ideas 
of 
something 
else. 
The 
soul 
when 
it 
thinks 
of 
anything 
must 
be 
affected 
effectively 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
and 
it 
must 
needs 
have 
in 
itself 
in 
advance 
not 
only 
the 
passive 
capacity 
of 
being 
thus 
affected, 
a 
capacity 
already 
wholly 
determined, 
but 
it 
must 
have 
besides 
an 
active 
power 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
has 
always 
had 
in 
its 
nature 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
future 
production 
of 
this 
thought, 
and 
the 
disposition 
to 
produce 
it 
at 
its 
proper 
time. 
All 
of 
this 
shows 
that 
the 
soul 
already 
includes 
the 
idea 
which 
is 
comprisedinanyparticularthought. 



XXX. 
How 
Godinclines 
our 
souls 
without 
necessitating 
them; 
that 
there 
are 
no 
grounds 
for 
complaint; 
that 
we 
must 
not 
ask 
whyJudas 
sinned 
because 
this 
free 
actis 
contained 
in 
his 
concept,the 
only 
question 
being 
why 
Judas 
the 
sinner 
is 
admitted 
to 
existence, 
preferably 
to 
other 
possible 
persons; 
concerning 
the 
original 
imperfection 
orlimitation 
before 
the 
fall 
and 
concerning 
thedifferent 
degreesof 
grace. 
REGARDING 
THE 
ACTION 
of 
God 
upon 
the 
human 
will 
there 
are 
many 
quite 
different 
considerations 
which 
it 
would 
take 
too 
long 
to 
investigate 
here. 
Nevertheless 
the 
following 
is 
what 
can 
be 
said 
in 
general. 
God 
in 
cooperating 
with 
ordinary 
actions 
only 
follows 
the 
laws 
which 
he 
has 
established, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
he 
continually 
preserves 
and 
produces 
our 
being 
so 
that 
the 
ideas 
come 
to 
us 
spontaneously 
or 
with 
freedom 
in 
that 
order 
which 
the 
concept 
of 
our 
individual 
substance 
carries 
with 
itself. 
In 
this 
concept 
they 
can 
be 
foreseen 
for 
all 
eternity. 
Furthermore, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
decree 
which 
God 
has 
made 
that 
the 
will 
shall 
always 
seek 
the 
apparent 
good 
in 
certain 
particular 
respects 
(in 
regard 
to 
which 
this 
apparent 
good 
always 
has 
in 
it 
something 
of 
reality 
expressing 
or 
imitating 
God’s 
will), 
he, 
without 
at 
all 
necessitating 
our 
choice, 
determines 
it 
by 
that 
which 
appears 
most 
desirable. 
For 
absolutely 
speaking, 
our 
will 
as 
contrasted 
with 
necessity, 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
indifference, 
being 
able 
to 
act 
otherwise, 
or 
wholly 
to 
suspend 
its 
action, 
either 
alternative 
being 
and 
remaining 
possible. 
It 
therefore 
devolves 
upon 
the 
soul 
to 
be 
on 
guard 
against 
appearances, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
firm 
will, 
to 
reflect 
and 
to 
refuse 
to 
act 
or 
decide 
in 
certain 
circumstances, 
except 
after 
mature 
deliberation. 
It 
is, 
however, 
true 
and 
has 
been 
assured 
from 
all 
eternitythatcertainsouls 
willnotemploytheirpoweruponcertainoccasions. 



But 
who 
could 
do 
more 
than 
God 
has 
done, 
and 
can 
such 
a 
soul 
complain 
of 
anything 
except 
itself? 
All 
these 
complaints 
after 
the 
deed 
are 
unjust, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
would 
have 
been 
unjust 
before 
the 
deed. 
Would 
this 
soul 
a 
little 
before 
committing 
the 
sin 
have 
had 
the 
right 
to 
complain 
of 
God 
as 
though 
he 
had 
determined 
the 
sin. 
Since 
the 
determinations 
of 
God 
in 
these 
matters 
cannot 
be 
foreseen, 
how 
would 
the 
soul 
know 
that 
it 
was 
preordained 
to 
sin 
unless 
it 
had 
already 
committed 
the 
sin? 
It 
is 
merely 
a 
question 
of 
wishing 
to 
or 
not 
wishing 
to, 
and 
God 
could 
not 
have 
set 
an 
easier 
or 
juster 
condition. 
Therefore 
all 
judges 
without 
asking 
the 
reasons 
which 
have 
disposed 
a 
man 
to 
have 
an 
evil 
will, 
consider 
only 
how 
far 
this 
will 
is 
wrong. 
But, 
you 
object, 
perhaps 
it 
is 
ordained 
from 
all 
eternity 
that 
I 
will 
sin. 
Find 
your 
own 
answer. 
Perhaps 
it 
has 
not 
been. 
Now 
then, 
without 
asking 
for 
what 
you 
are 
unable 
to 
know 
and 
in 
regard 
to 
which 
you 
can 
have 
no 
light, 
act 
according 
to 
your 
duty 
and 
your 
knowledge. 
But, 
some 
one 
will 
object; 
whence 
comes 
it 
then 
that 
this 
man 
will 
assuredly 
do 
this 
sin? 
The 
reply 
is 
easy. 
It 
is 
that 
otherwise 
he 
would 
not 
be 
a 
man. 
For 
God 
foresees 
from 
all 
time 
that 
there 
will 
be 
a 
certain 
Judas, 
and 
in 
the 
concept 
or 
idea 
of 
him 
which 
God 
has, 
is 
contained 
this 
future 
free 
act. 
The 
only 
question, 
therefore, 
which 
remains 
is 
why 
this 
certain 
Judas, 
the 
betrayer 
who 
is 
possible 
only 
because 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
actually 
exists. 
To 
this 
question, 
however, 
we 
can 
expect 
no 
answer 
here 
on 
earth 
excepting 
to 
say 
in 
general 
that 
it 
is 
because 
God 
has 
found 
it 
good 
that 
he 
should 
exist 
notwithstanding 
that 
sin 
which 
he 
foresaw. 
This 
evil 
will 
be 
more 
than 
overbalanced. 
God 
will 
derive 
a 
greater 
good 
from 
it, 
and 
it 
will 
finally 
turn 
out 
that 
this 
series 
of 
events 
in 
which 
is 
included 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
sinner, 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
among 
all 
the 
possible 
series 
of 
events. 
An 
explanation 
in 
every 
case 
of 
the 
admirable 
economyof 
thischoicecannotbegivenwhilewearesojourners 
onearth. 
It 
is 
enough 
to 
know 
the 
excellence 
without 
understanding 
it. 
It 
is 
here 
that 
must 



be 
recognized 
altitudinem 
divitiarum, 
the 
unfathomable 
depth 
of 
the 
divine 
wisdom, 
without 
hesitating 
at 
a 
detail 
which 
involves 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
considerations. 
It 
is 
clear, 
however, 
that 
God 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
ill. 
For 
not 
only 
after 
the 
loss 
of 
innocence 
by 
men, 
has 
original 
sin 
possessed 
the 
soul, 
but 
even 
before 
that 
there 
was 
an 
original 
limitation 
or 
imperfection 
in 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
all 
creatures, 
which 
rendered 
them 
open 
to 
sin 
and 
able 
to 
fall. 
There 
is, 
therefore, 
no 
more 
difficulty 
in 
the 
supralapsarian 
view 
than 
there 
is 
in 
the 
other 
views 
of 
sin. 
To 
this 
also, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
can 
be 
reduced 
the 
opinion 
of 
Saint 
Augustine 
and 
of 
other 
authors: 
that 
the 
root 
of 
evil 
is 
in 
the 
negativity, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
lack 
or 
limitation 
of 
creatures 
which 
God 
graciously 
remedies 
by 
whatever 
degree 
of 
perfection 
it 
pleases 
him 
to 
give. 
This 
grace 
of 
God, 
whether 
ordinary 
or 
extraordinary 
has 
its 
degrees 
and 
its 
measures. 
It 
is 
always 
efficacious 
in 
itself 
to 
produce 
a 
certain 
proportionate 
effect 
and 
furthermore 
it 
is 
always 
sufficient 
not 
only 
to 
keep 
one 
from 
sin 
but 
even 
to 
effect 
his 
salvation, 
provided 
that 
the 
man 
co-operates 
with 
that 
which 
is 
in 
him. 
It 
has 
not 
always, 
however, 
sufficient 
power 
to 
overcome 
the 
inclination, 
for, 
if 
it 
did, 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
limited 
in 
any 
way, 
and 
this 
superiority 
to 
limitations 
is 
reserved 
to 
that 
unique 
grace 
which 
is 
absolutely 
efficacious. 
This 
grace 
is 
always 
victorious 
whether 
through 
its 
own 
self 
or 
throughthecongruityofcircumstances. 



XXXI. 
Concerning 
the 
motives 
of 
election; 
concerning 
faith 
foreseen 
and 
the 
absolute 
decree 
and 
thatit 
all 
reduces 
to 
the 
question 
why 
God 
has 
chosen 
and 
resolved 
to 
admit 
to 
existence 
just 
sucha 
possible 
person, 
whose 
concept 
includes 
just 
such 
a 
sequence 
of 
freeacts 
and 
of 
free 
gifts 
of 
grace. 
This 
at 
once 
puts 
an 
end 
to 
all 
difficulties. 



FINALLY, 
THE 
GRACE 
of 
God 
is 
wholly 
unprejudiced 
and 
creatures 
have 
no 
claim 
upon 
it. 
Just 
as 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
in 
accounting 
for 
God’s 
choice 
in 
his 
dispensations 
of 
grace 
to 
refer 
to 
his 
absolute 
or 
conditional 
prevision 
of 
men’s 
future 
actions, 
so 
it 
is 
also 
wrong 
to 
imagine 
his 
decrees 
as 
absolute 
with 
no 
reasonable 
motive. 
As 
concerns 
foreseen 
faith 
and 
good 
works, 
it 
is 
very 
true 
that 
God 
has 
elected 
none 
but 
those 
whose 
faith 
and 
charity 
he 
foresees, 
quos 
se 
fide 
donaturum 
praescivit. 
The 
same 
question, 
however, 
arises 
again 
as 
to 
why 
God 
gives 
to 
some 
rather 
than 
to 
others 
the 
grace 
of 
faith 
orofgood 
works. 
As 
concerns 
God’s 
ability 
to 
foresee 
notonly 
the 
faith 
and 
good 
deeds, 
but 
also 
their 
material 
and 
predisposition, 
or 
that 
which 
a 
man 
on 
his 
part 
contributes 
to 
them 
(since 
there 
are 
as 
truly 
diversities 
on 
the 
part 
of 
men 
as 
on 
the 
part 
of 
grace, 
and 
a 
man 
although 
he 
needs 
to 
be 
aroused 
to 
good 
and 
needs 
to 
become 
converted, 
yet 
acts 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
temperament), 
— 
as 
regards 
his 
ability 
to 
foresee 
there 
are 
many 
who 
say 
that 
God, 
knowing 
what 
a 
particular 
man 
will 
do 
without 
grace, 
that 
is 
without 
his 
extraordinary 
assistance, 
or 
knowing 
at 
least 
what 
will 
be 
the 
human 
contribution, 
resolves 
to 
give 
grace 
to 
those 
whose 
natural 
dispositions 
are 
the 
best, 
or 
at 
any 
rate 
are 
the 
least 
imperfect 
and 
evil. 
But 
if 
this 
were 
the 
case 
then 
the 
natural 
dispositions 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
were 
good 
would 
be 
like 
gifts 
of 
grace, 
since 
God 
would 
have 
given 
advantages 
to 
some 



over 
others; 
and 
therefore, 
since 
he 
would 
well 
know 
that 
the 
natural 
advantages 
which 
he 
had 
given 
would 
serve 
as 
motives 
for 
his 
grace 
or 
for 
his 
extraordinary 
assistance, 
would 
not 
everything 
be 
reduced 
to 
his 
mercy? 
I 
think, 
therefore, 
that 
since 
we 
do 
not 
know 
how 
much 
and 
in 
what 
way 
God 
regards 
natural 
dispositions 
in 
the 
dispensations 
of 
his 
grace, 
it 
would 
be 
safest 
and 
most 
exact 
to 
say, 
in 
accordance 
with 
our 
principles 
and 
as 
I 
have 
already 
remarked, 
that 
there 
must 
needs 
be 
among 
possible 
beings 
the 
person 
Peter 
or 
John 
whose 
concept 
or 
idea 
contains 
all 
that 
particular 
sequence 
of 
ordinary 
and 
extraordinary 
manifestations 
of 
grace 
together 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
accompanying 
events 
and 
circumstances, 
and 
that 
it 
has 
pleased 
God 
to 
choose 
him 
among 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
persons 
equally 
possible 
for 
actual 
existence. 
When 
we 
have 
said 
this 
there 
seems 
nothing 
left 
to 
ask, 
and 
all 
difficulties 
vanish. 
Forin 
regard 
to 
that 
greatand 
ultimate 
question 
why 
it 
has 
pleased 
God 
to 
choose 
him 
among 
so 
great 
a 
number 
of 
possible 
persons, 
it 
is 
surely 
unreasonable 
to 
demand 
more 
than 
the 
general 
reasons 
which 
we 
have 
given. 
The 
reasons 
in 
detail 
surpass 
our 
ken. 
Therefore, 
instead 
of 
postulating 
an 
absolute 
decree, 
which 
being 
without 
reason 
would 
be 
unreasonable, 
and 
instead 
of 
postulating 
reasons 
which 
do 
not 
succeed 
in 
solving 
the 
difficulties 
and 
in 
turn 
have 
need 
themselves 
of 
reasons, 
it 
will 
be 
best 
to 
say 
with 
St. 
Paul 
that 
there 
are 
for 
God’s 
choice 
certain 
great 
reasons 
of 
wisdom 
and 
congruity 
which 
he 
follows, 
which 
reasons, 
however, 
are 
unknown 
to 
mortals 
and 
are 
founded 
upon 
the 
general 
order, 
whose 
goal 
is 
the 
greatest 
perfection 
of 
the 
world. 
This 
is 
what 
is 
meant 
when 
the 
motives 
of 
God’s 
glory 
and 
of 
the 
manifestation 
of 
his 
justice 
are 
spoken 
of, 
as 
well 
as 
when 
men 
speak 
of 
his 
mercy, 
and 
his 
perfection 
in 
general; 
that 
immense 
vastness 
of 
wealth, 
in 
fine, 
withwhich

XXXII. 
Usefulness 
of 
these 
principles 
in 
matters 
of 
piety 
and 
of 
religion. 



IN 
ADDITION 
IT 
seems 
that 
the 
thoughts 
which 
we 
have 
just 
explained 
and 
particularly 
the 
great 
principle 
of 
the 
perfection 
of 
God’s 
operations 
and 
the 
concept 
of 
substance 
which 
includes 
all 
its 
changes 
with 
all 
its 
accompanying 
circumstances, 
far 
from 
injuring, 
serve 
rather 
to 
confirm 
religion, 
serve 
to 
dissipate 
great 
difficulties, 
to 
inflame 
souls 
with 
a 
divine 
love 
and 
to 
raise 
the 
mind 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
incorporeal 
substances 
much 
more 
than 
the 
present-
day 
hypotheses. 
For 
it 
appears 
clearly 
that 
all 
other 
substances 
depend 
upon 
God 
just 
as 
our 
thoughts 
emanate 
from 
our 
own 
substances; 
that 
God 
is 
all 
in 
alland 
that 
heisintimately 
united 
to 
all 
createdthings, 
in 
proportion 
however 
to 
their 
perfection; 
that 
it 
is 
he 
alone 
who 
determines 
them 
from 
without 
by 
his 
influence, 
and 
if 
to 
act 
is 
to 
determine 
directly, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
in 
metaphysical 
language 
that 
God 
alone 
acts 
upon 
me 
and 
he 
alone 
causes 
me 
to 
do 
good 
or 
ill, 
other 
substances 
contributing 
only 
because 
of 
his 
determinations; 
because 
God, 
who 
takes 
all 
things 
into 
consideration, 
distributes 
his 
bounties 
and 
compels 
created 
beings 
to 
accommodate 
themselves 
to 
one 
another. 
Thus 
God 
alone 
constitutes 
the 
relation 
or 
communication 
between 
substances. 
It 
is 
through 
him 
that 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
one 
meet 
and 
accord 
with 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
others, 
so 
that 
there 
may 
be 
a 
reality 
in 
our 
perceptions. 
In 
common 
parlance, 
however, 
an 
action 
is 
attributed 
to 
particular 
causes 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
I 
have 
explained 
above 
because 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
make 
continual 
mention 
of 
the 
universal 
cause 
when 
speaking 
of 
particular 
cases. 
It 
can 
be 
seen 
also 
that 
every 
substance 
has 
a 
perfect 
spontaneity 
(which 
becomes 
liberty 
with 
intelligent 
substances). 
Everything 
which 
happens 
to 
it 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
its 
idea 
or 
its 
being 
and 



nothing 
determines 
it 
except 
God 
only. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
a 
person 
of 
exalted 
mind 
and 
revered 
saintliness 
may 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
ought 
often 
to 
think 
as 
if 
there 
were 
only 
God 
and 
itself 
in 
the 
world. 
Nothing 
can 
make 
us 
hold 
to 
immortality 
more 
firmly 
than 
this 
independence 
and 
vastness 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
protects 
it 
completely 
against 
exterior 
things, 
since 
it 
alone 
constitutes 
our 
universe 
and 
together 
with 
God 
is 
sufficient 
for 
itself. 
It 
is 
as 
impossible 
for 
it 
to 
perish 
save 
through 
annihilation 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
the 
universe 
to 
destroy 
itself, 
the 
universe 
whose 
animate 
and 
perpetual 
expression 
it 
is. 
Furthermore, 
the 
changes 
in 
this 
extended 
mass 
which 
is 
called 
our 
body 
cannot 
possibly 
affect 
the 
soul 
nor 
can 
the 
dissipation 
of 
the 
bodydestroythatwhich 
isindivisible. 



XXXIII. 
Explanationof 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
a 
matter 
which 
has 
beenregarded 
as 
inexplicable 
or 
else 
as 
miraculous; 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
confusedperceptions. 
WE 
CAN 
ALSO 
see 
the 
explanation 
of 
that 
great 
mystery 
“the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body,” 
that 
is 
to 
say 
how 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
the 
passions 
and 
actions 
of 
the 
one 
are 
accompanied 
by 
the 
actions 
and 
passions 
or 
else 
the 
appropriate 
phenomena 
of 
the 
other. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
conceive 
how 
one 
can 
have 
an 
influence 
upon 
the 
other 
and 
it 
is 
unreasonable 
to 
have 
recourse 
at 
once 
to 
the 
extraordinary 
intervention 
of 
the 
universal 
cause 
in 
an 
ordinary 
and 
particular 
case. 
The 
following, 
however, 
is 
the 
true 
explanation. 
We 
have 
said 
that 
everything 
which 
happens 
to 
a 
soul 
or 
to 
any 
substance 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
its 
concept; 
hence 
the 
idea 
itself 
or 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
soul 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
all 
of 
its 
appearances 
or 
perceptions 
should 
be 
born 
out 
of 
its 
nature 
and 
precisely 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
they 
correspond 
of 
themselves 
to 
that 
which 
happens 
in 
the 
universe 
at 
large, 
but 
more 
particularly 
and 
more 
perfectly 
to 
that 
which 
happens 
in 
the 
body 
associated 
with 
it, 
because 
it 
is 
in 
a 
particular 
way 
and 
only 
for 
a 
certain 
time 
according 
to 
the 
relation 
of 
other 
bodies 
to 
its 
own 
body 
that 
the 
soul 
expresses 
the 
state 
of 
the 
universe. 
This 
last 
fact 
enables 
us 
to 
see 
how 
our 
body 
belongs 
to 
us, 
without, 
however, 
being 
attached 
to 
our 
essence. 
I 
believe 
that 
those 
who 
are 
careful 
thinkers 
will 
decide 
favorably 
for 
our 
principles 
because 
of 
this 
single 
reason, 
viz. 
that 
they 
are 
able 
to 
see 
in 
what 
consists 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
a 
parallelism 
which 
appears 
inexplicable 
in 
any 
other 
way. 
We 
can 
also 
see 
that 
the 
perceptions 
of 
our 
senses 
even 
when 
they 
are 
clear 
must 
necessarily 
contain 
certain 
confused 
elements, 
for 
as 
all 
the 
bodies 
in 
the 
universe 
are 
in 
sympathy, 
ours 
receives 
the 
impressions 
of 
all 
the 
others, 
and 



whileour 
sensesrespondto 
everything,oursoulcannotpayattentionto 
every 
particular. 
That 
is 
why 
our 
confused 
sensations 
are 
the 
result 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
perceptions. 
This 
variety 
is 
infinite. 
It 
is 
almost 
like 
the 
confused 
murmuring 
which 
is 
heard 
by 
those 
who 
approach 
the 
shore 
of 
a 
sea. 
It 
comes 
from 
the 
continual 
beatings 
of 
innumerable 
waves. 
If 
now, 
out 
of 
many 
perceptions 
which 
do 
not 
at 
all 
fit 
together 
to 
make 
one, 
no 
particular 
one 
perception 
surpasses 
the 
others, 
and 
if 
they 
make 
impressions 
about 
equally 
strong 
or 
equally 
capable 
of 
holding 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
soul, 
they 
can 
be 
perceived 
onlyconfusedly. 



XXXIV. 
Concerning 
the 
difference 
between 
spirits 
and 
other 
substances, 
souls 
orsubstantial 
forms; 
that 
the 
immortality 
which 
men 
desire 
includes 
memory. 



SUPPOSING 
THAT 
THE 
bodies 
which 
constitute 
a 
unum 
per 
se, 
as 
human 
bodies, 
are 
substances, 
and 
have 
substantial 
forms, 
and 
supposing 
that 
animals 
have 
souls, 
we 
are 
obliged 
to 
grant 
that 
these 
souls 
and 
these 
substantial 
forms 
cannot 
entirely 
perish, 
any 
more 
than 
can 
the 
atoms 
or 
the 
ultimate 
elements 
of 
matter, 
according 
to 
the 
position 
of 
other 
philosophers; 
for 
no 
substance 
perishes, 
although 
it 
may 
become 
very 
different. 
Such 
substances 
also 
express 
the 
whole 
universe, 
although 
more 
imperfectly 
than 
do 
spirits. 
The 
principle 
difference, 
however, 
is 
that 
they 
do 
not 
know 
that 
they 
are, 
nor 
what 
they 
are. 
Consequently, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
reason, 
they 
are 
unable 
to 
discover 
necessary 
and 
universal 
truths. 
It 
is 
also 
because 
they 
do 
not 
reflect 
regarding 
themselves 
that 
they 
have 
no 
moral 
qualities, 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
undergoing 
a 
thousand 
transformations, 
as 
we 
see 
a 
caterpillar 
change 
into 
a 
butterfly, 
the 
result 
from 
a 
moral 
or 
practical 
standpoint 
is 
the 
same 
as 
if 
we 
said 
that 
they 
perished 
in 
each 
case, 
and 
we 
can 
indeed 
say 
it 
from 
the 
physical 
standpoint 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
we 
say 
bodies 
perish 
in 
their 
dissolution. 
But 
the 
intelligent 
soul, 
knowing 
that 
it 
is 
and 
having 
the 
ability 
to 
say 
that 
word 
“I” 
so 
full 
of 
meaning, 
not 
only 
continues 
and 
exists, 
metaphysically 
far 
more 
certainly 
than 
do 
the 
others, 
but 
it 
remains 
the 
same 
from 
the 
moral 
standpoint, 
and 
constitutes 
the 
same 
personality, 
for 
it 
is 
its 
memory 
or 
knowledge 
of 
this 
ego 
which 
renders 
it 
open 
to 
punishment 
and 
reward. 
Also 
the 
immortality 
which 
is 
required 
in 
morals 
and 
in 
religion 
does 
not 
consist 
merely 
in 
this 
perpetual 
existence, 
which 
pertains 
to 
all 
substances, 
for 
if 
in 
addition 
there 
were 
no 
remembrance 
of 
what 
one 
had 



been, 
immortality 
would 
not 
be 
at 
all 
desirable. 
Suppose 
that 
some 
individual 
could 
suddenly 
become 
King 
of 
China 
on 
condition, 
however, 
of 
forgetting 
what 
he 
had 
been, 
as 
though 
being 
born 
again, 
would 
it 
not 
amount 
to 
the 
same 
practically, 
or 
as 
far 
as 
the 
effects 
could 
be 
perceived, 
as 
if 
the 
individual 
were 
annihilated, 
and 
a 
king 
of 
China 
were 
the

XXXV. 
The 
excellence 
ofspirits; 
that 
God 
considersthem 
preferable 
to 
othercreatures;that 
the 
spirits 
express 
God 
rather 
than 
the 
world, 
while 
othersimple 
substances 
express 
the 
worldrather 
than 
God. 



IN 
ORDER, 
HOWEVER, 
to 
prove 
by 
natural 
reasons 
that 
God 
will 
preserve 
forever 
not 
only 
our 
substance, 
but 
also 
our 
personality, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
the 
recollection 
and 
knowledge 
of 
what 
we 
are 
(although 
the 
distinct 
knowledge 
is 
sometimes 
suspended 
during 
sleep 
and 
in 
swoons) 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
join 
to 
metaphysics 
moral 
considerations. 
God 
must 
be 
considered 
not 
only 
as 
the 
principle 
and 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
substances 
and 
of 
all 
existing 
things, 
but 
also 
as 
the 
chief 
of 
all 
persons 
or 
intelligent 
substances, 
as 
the 
absolute 
monarch 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
city 
or 
republic, 
such 
as 
is 
constituted 
by 
all 
the 
spirits 
together 
in 
the 
universe, 
God 
being 
the 
most 
complete 
of 
all 
spirits 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
he 
is 
greatest 
of 
all 
beings. 
For 
assuredly 
the 
spirits 
are 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
substances 
and 
best 
express 
the 
divinity. 
Since 
all 
the 
nature, 
purpose, 
virtue 
and 
function 
of 
substances 
is, 
as 
has 
been 
sufficiently 
explained,to 
express 
Godandtheuniverse, 
there 
isnoroomfordoubtingthat 
thosesubstances 
whichgivethe 
expression, 
knowingwhattheyare 
doingand 
which 
are 
able 
to 
understand 
the 
great 
truths 
about 
God 
and 
the 
universe, 
do 
express 
God 
and 
the 
universe 
incomparably 
better 
than 
do 
those 
natures 
which 
are 
either 
brutish 
and 
incapable 
of 
recognizing 
truths, 
or 
are 
wholly 
destitute 
of 
sensation 
and 
knowledge. 
The 
difference 
between 
intelligent 
substances 
and 
those 
which 
are 
not 
intelligent 
is 
quite 
as 
great 
as 
between 
a 
mirror 
and 
one 
who 
sees. 
As 
God 
is 
himself 
the 
greatest 
and 
wisest 
of 
spirits 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
spirits 
with 
which 
he 
can, 
so 
to 
speak, 
enter 
into 
conversation 
and 
even 
into 
social 
relations 
by 
communicating 
to 
them 
in 



particular 
ways 
his 
feelings 
and 
his 
will 
so 
that 
they 
are 
able 
to 
know 
and 
love 
their 
benefactor, 
must 
be 
much 
nearer 
to 
him 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
created 
things 
which 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
instruments 
of 
spirits. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
we 
see 
that 
all 
wise 
persons 
consider 
far 
more 
the 
condition 
of 
a 
man 
than 
of 
anything 
else 
however 
precious 
it 
may 
be; 
and 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
greatest 
satisfaction 
which 
a 
soul, 
satisfied 
in 
other 
respects, 
can 
have 
is 
to 
see 
itself 
loved 
by 
others. 
However, 
with 
respect 
to 
God 
there 
is 
this 
difference 
that 
his 
glory 
and 
our 
worship 
can 
add 
nothing 
to 
his 
satisfaction, 
the 
recognition 
of 
creatures 
being 
nothing 
but 
a 
consequence 
of 
his 
sovereign 
and 
perfect 
felicity 
and 
being 
far 
from 
contributing 
to 
it 
or 
from 
causing 
it 
even 
in 
part. 
Nevertheless, 
that 
which 
is 
reasonable 
in 
finite 
spirits 
is 
found 
eminently 
in 
him 
and 
as 
we 
praise 
a 
king 
who 
prefers 
to 
preserve 
the 
life 
of 
a 
man 
before 
that 
of 
the 
most 
precious 
and 
rare 
of 
his 
animals, 
we 
should 
not 
doubt 
that

XXXVI. 
Godis 
the 
monarch 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
republic 
composed 
of 
all 
the 
spirits, 
and 
the 
happiness 
of 
this 
city 
of 
God 
is 
his 
principalpurpose. 



SPIRITS 
ARE 
OF 
all 
substances 
the 
most 
capable 
of 
perfection 
and 
their 
perfections 
are 
different 
in 
this 
that 
they 
interfere 
with 
one 
another 
the 
least, 
or 
rather 
they 
aid 
one 
another 
the 
most, 
for 
only 
the 
most 
virtuous 
can 
be 
the 
most 
perfect 
friends. 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
God 
who 
in 
all 
things 
has 
the 
greatest 
perfection 
will 
have 
the 
greatest 
care 
for 
spirits 
and 
will 
give 
not 
only 
to 
all 
of 
them 
in 
general, 
but 
even 
to 
each 
one 
in 
particular 
the 
highest 
perfection 
which 
the 
universal 
harmony 
will 
permit. 
We 
can 
even 
say 
that 
it 
is 
because 
he 
is 
a 
spirit 
that 
God 
is 
the 
originator 
of 
existences, 
for 
if 
he 
had 
lacked 
the 
power 
of 
will 
to 
choose 
what 
is 
best, 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
reason 
why 
one 
possible 
being 
should 
exist 
rather 
than 
any 
other. 
Therefore 
God’s 
being 
a 
spirit 
himself 
dominates 
all 
the 
consideration 
which 
he 
may 
have 
toward 
created 
things. 
Spirits 
alone 
are 
made 
in 
his 
image, 
being 
as 
it 
were 
of 
his 
blood 
or 
as 
children 
in 
the 
family, 
since 
they 
alone 
are 
able 
to 
serve 
him 
of 
free 
will, 
and 
to 
act 
consciously 
imitating 
the 
divine 
nature. 
A 
single 
spirit 
is 
worth 
a 
whole 
world, 
because 
it 
not 
only 
expresses 
the 
whole 
world, 
but 
it 
also 
knows 
it 
and 
governs 
itself 
as 
does 
God. 
In 
this 
way 
we 
may 
say 
that 
though 
every 
substance 
expresses 
the 
whole 
universe, 
yet 
the 
other 
substances 
express 
the 
world 
rather 
than 
God, 
while 
spirits 
express 
God 
rather 
than 
the 
world. 
This 
nature 
of 
spirits, 
so 
noble 
that 
it 
enables 
them 
to 
approachdivinityas 
muchasispossibleforcreatedthings,hasasaresult 
that 
God 
derives 
infinitely 
more 
glory 
from 
them 
than 
from 
the 
other 
beings, 
or 
rather 
the 
other 
beings 
furnish 
to 
spirits 
the 
material 
for 
glorifying 
him. 
This 
moral 
quality 
of 
God 
which 
constitutes 
him 
Lord 
and 
Monarch 
of 
spirits 



influences 
him 
so 
to 
speak 
personally 
and 
in 
a 
unique 
way. 
It 
is 
through 
this 
that 
he 
humanizes 
himself, 
that 
heis 
willing 
to 
sufferanthropologies, 
and 
that 
he 
enters 
into 
social 
relations 
with 
us 
and 
this 
consideration 
is 
so 
dear 
to 
him 
that 
the 
happy 
and 
prosperous 
condition 
of 
his 
empire 
which 
consists 
in 
the 
greatest 
possible 
felicity 
of 
its 
inhabitants, 
becomes 
supreme 
among 
his 
laws. 
Happiness 
is 
to 
persons 
what 
perfection 
is 
to 
beings. 
And 
if 
the 
dominant 
principle 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
physical 
world 
is 
the 
decree 
to 
give 
it 
the 
greatest 
possible 
perfection, 
the 
primary 
purpose 
in 
the 
moral 
world 
or 
in 
the 
city 
of 
God 
which 
constitutes 
the 
noblest 
part 
of 
the 
universe 
ought 
to 
be 
to 
extend 
the 
greatest 
happiness 
possible. 
We 
must 
not 
therefore 
doubt 
that 
God 
hasso 
ordained 
everythingthatspirits 
not 
only 
shall 
live 
forever,because 
this 
is 
unavoidable, 
butthatthey 
shall 
also 
preserve 
forever 
their 
moralquality,so 
that 
his 
city 
may 
never 
lose 
a 
person, 
quite 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
world 
never 
loses 
a 
substance. 
Consequently 
they 
will 
always 
be 
conscious 
of 
their 
being, 
otherwise 
they 
would 
be 
open 
to 
neither 
reward 
nor 
punishment, 
a 
condition 
which 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
a 
republic, 
and 
above 
all 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
republic 
where 
nothing 
can 
be 
neglected. 
In 
fine, 
God 
being 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
most 
just 
and 
the 
most 
debonnaire 
of 
monarchs, 
and 
requiring 
only 
a 
good 
will 
on 
the 
part 
of 
men, 
provided 
that 
it 
be 
sincere 
and 
intentional, 
his 
subjects 
cannot 
desire 
a 
better 
condition. 
To 
render 
them 
perfectly 
happy 
he 
desiresonly 
thatthey 
lovehim. 



XXXVII. 
JesusChrist 
has 
revealedto 
menthe 
mystery 
and 
the 
admirable 
laws 
of 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven, 
and 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
supreme 
happiness 
which 
Godhas 
prepared 
for 
those 
who 
love 
him. 
THE 
ANCIENT 
PHILOSOPHERS 
knew 
very 
little 
of 
these 
important 
truths. 
Jesus 
Christ 
alone 
has 
expressed 
them 
divinely 
well, 
and 
in 
a 
way 
so 
clear 
and 
simple 
that 
the 
dullest 
minds 
have 
understood 
them. 
His 
gospel 
has 
entirely 
changed 
the 
face 
of 
human 
affairs. 
It 
has 
brought 
us 
to 
know 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven, 
or 
that 
perfect 
republic 
of 
spirits 
which 
deserves 
to 
be 
called 
the 
city 
of 
God. 
He 
it 
is 
who 
has 
discovered 
to 
us 
its 
wonderful 
laws. 
He 
alone 
has 
made 
us 
see 
how 
much 
God 
loves 
us 
and 
with 
what 
care 
everything 
that 
concerns 
us 
has 
been 
provided 
for; 
how 
God, 
inasmuch 
as 
he 
cares 
for 
the 
sparrows, 
will 
not 
neglect 
reasoning 
beings, 
who 
are 
infinitely 
more 
dear 
to 
him; 
how 
all 
the 
hairs 
of 
our 
heads 
are 
numbered; 
how 
heaven 
and 
earth 
may 
pass 
away 
but 
the 
word 
of 
God 
and 
that 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
means 
of 
our 
salvation 
will 
not 
pass 
away; 
how 
God 
has 
more 
regard 
for 
the 
least 
one 
among 
intelligent 
souls 
than 
for 
the 
whole 
machinery 
of 
the 
world; 
how 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
fear 
those 
who 
are 
able 
to 
destroy 
the 
body 
but 
are 
unable 
to 
destroy 
the 
soul, 
since 
God 
alone 
can 
render 
the 
soul 
happy 
or 
unhappy; 
and 
how 
the 
souls 
of 
the 
righteous 
are 
protected 
by 
his 
hand 
against 
all 
the 
upheavals 
of 
the 
universe, 
since 
God 
alone 
is 
able 
to 
act 
upon 
them; 
how 
none 
of 
our 
acts 
are 
forgotten; 
how 
everything 
is 
to 
be 
accounted 
for; 
even 
careless 
words 
and 
even 
a 
spoonful 
of 
water 
which 
is 
well 
used; 
in 
fact 
how 
everything 
must 
result 
in 
the 
greatest 
welfare 
of 
the 
good, 
for 
then 
shall 
the 
righteous 
become 
like 
suns 
and 
neither 
our 
sense 
nor 
our 
minds 
have 
ever 



tasted 
of 
anything 
approaching 
the 
joys 
which 
God 
has 
laid 
up 
for 
those 
that 
lovehim. 



A 
Philosopher’s 
Creed 
(1673) 



Original 
Title: 
‘Confessio 
philosophi’ 


Anonymous 
translation 


Leibniz’ 
early 
dialogue 
Confessio 
philosophi 
engages 
with 
what 
he 
believed 
to 
be 
the 
central 
task 
of 
theodicy: 
to 
uphold 
the 
justice 
of 
God. 
The 
dialogue 
explains 
his 
commitment 
to 
the 
claim 
that 
ours 
is 
the 
best 
possible 
world, 
offering 
an 
account 
of 
how 
such 
a 
world 
could 
include 
damnation. 
Various 
answers 
to 
the 
question 
why 
God 
is 
justified 
in 
permitting 
sin 
are 
suggested 
by 
Leibniz, 
examining 
the 
threat 
to 
God’s 
justice 
raised 
by 
the 
doctrine 
of 
eternal 
damnation. 
Overall, 
the 
Confessio 
philosophi 
formulates 
a 
general 
account 
of 
God’s 
relation 
to 
sin 
and 
evil, 
which 
would 
become 
an 
essential 
fixture 
of 
Leibniz’ 
later 
philosophy. 
How 
can 
God 
be 
understood 
to 
be 
the 
ultimate 
cause, 
asks 
Leibniz, 
without 
God 
being 
considered 
as 
the 
author 
of 
sin, 
a 
conclusion 
incompatible 
with 
God’s 
holiness? 
Leibniz’ 
attempts 
to 
justify 
the 
way 
of 
God 
to 
man 
also 
led 
him 
to 
a 
detailed 
analysis 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
free 
choice, 
the 
problems 
of 
necessitarianism 
and 
fatalism, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
natureofdivinejustice 
andholiness.

A 
PHILOSOPHER’S 
CREED 



Catechist 
Theologian: 
RECENTLY, 
we 
spoke 
at 
length 
about 
the 
mind’s 
immortality 
and 
the 
logical 
necessity 
of 
a 
Governor 
of 
the 
world. 
If 
you 
continue 
to 
besosatisfying, 
Iwillhave 
no 
troublein 
teaching 
you. 
Now 
there 
awaits 
us 
the 
thorny 
consideration 
of 
God’s 
justice, 
for 
nothing 
is 
used 
more 
often 
or 
so 
speciously 
to 
refute 
Providence 
than 
the 
disorder 
of 
things. 
Set 
about 
solving 
this 
with 
proper 
reasoning 
and 
refine 
it 
to 
my 
liking, 
so

in

Philosopher: 
I’ll 
prove 
it, 
so 
that 
others 
won’t 
deny 
it. 
Happiness 
exists 
only 
inthemind. 


Theologian: 
Right, 
since 
no 
one 
is 
happy 
without 
knowing 
it. 
(You 
know 
that 
oldsaying: 
How 
blessedare 
they 
that 
knowtheir 
own 
blessings!) 
Whatever 
is 
conscious 
of 
its 
own 
condition 
is 
a 
mind. 
Therefore, 
only 
a 
mind 
can 
be 
happy. 


Philosopher: 
Well 
argued! 
But 
at 
any 
rate, 
happiness 
is 
the 
state 
of 
mind 
most 
pleasing 
to 
the 
mind 
itself; 
yet 
in 
truth, 
the 
mind 
is 
most 
pleased 
by 
harmony. 


Theologian: 
True 
enough, 
especially 
since 
we 
just 
agreed 
that 
“to 
delight” 
meant 
“toexperienceharmony”. 


Philosopher: 
Therefore, 
happiness 
is 
the 
most 
harmonious 
state 
of 
mind. 
Moreover, 
since 
the 
mind’s 
nature 
is 
to 
consider, 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
mind 
lies 
in 
considering 
harmony. 
Hence 
the 
greatest 
harmony 
of 
the 
mind, 
i.e. 
happiness,liesinthecontemplationof 
the 
universalharmony(i.e. 
God)inthe 
mind. 


Theologian: 
Excellent:

the 
happiness 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
contemplation 
ofGodare 
likewiseshowntobethesame. 


Philosopher: 
Then 
I 
surpassed 
what 
I 
was 
trying 
to 
prove, 
namely 
that 
every 
happinessis 
harmonious. 


Theologian: 
Nowitistime 
for 
youtoshowthatGodloveseveryone. 


Philosopher: 
Considerit 
already 
done. 
If 
everyone’s 
happiness 
is 
harmonious 
(as 
just 
proven) 
and 
if 
God 
is 
aware 
of 
every 
harmony 
(by 
the 
definition 
of 



“God”) 
and 
if 
every 
experience 
of 
harmony 
is 
delightful 
(by 
the 
definition 
of 
“delight”) 
then 
it 
follows 
that 
everyone’s 
happiness 
is 
pleasing 
to 
God. 
Therefore, 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
“love” 
given 
before, 
God 
loves 
everyone, 
and 
thereforeGod 
isjust,fromthedefinitionof 
“just”. 


Theologian: 
I 
would 
almost 
say 
that 
you 
had 
proven 
it. 
And 
I’m 
sure 
that 
none 
of 
those 
who 
deny 
universal 
grace 
could 
even 
argue 
with 
anything 
you’ve 
said, 
provided 
that 
they 
used 
the 
words 
in 
the 
same 
senses 
as 
you 
have,notdepartingfrom 
theirusualmeanings. 


Philosopher: 
I 
believe 
my 
conclusion 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
their 
own 
way 
of 
thinking. 
For 
when 
they 
claim 
that 
God 
only 
loves 
the 
chosen, 
they 
like 
to 
point 
out 
that 
He 
loves 
some 
more 
than 
others 
(by 
the 
definition 
of 
“choose”) 
and 
also 
that 
not 
everyone 
can 
be 
saved, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
just 
as 
a 
picture 
is 
set 
off 
with 
shadows, 
or 
a 
consonance 
emphasized 
by 
surrounding 
dissonance. 
God 
allows 
the 
others 
who 
are 
less 
beloved 
to 
be 
rejected, 
which 
He 
does 
not 
desire 
(for 
God 
does 
not 
want 
the 
sinner’s 
death), 
but 
which 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
entails. 
So 
when 
it 
is 
said 
that 
God 
loved 
one 
and 
hated 
another, 
the 
meaning 
is 
that 
he 
loved 
the 
other 
less 
and 
thereforelethimbe 
rejected, 
since 
noteveryone 
canbe 
chosen. 
Butwhen 
a 
lesser 
good 
is 
regarded 
like 
a 
condemnation, 
so 
a 
lesser 
love 
is 
made 
to 
seem 
like 
hatred 
when 
the 
two 
loves 
are 
compared, 
although 
hatred 
and 
condemnation 
are 
not 
appropriate 
words. 
But 
we 
oughtn’t 
really 
go 
into 
why 
Godloves 
onemorethan 
another. 


Theologian: 
But 
wait, 
that’s 
where 
we 
run 
into 
our 
biggest 
difficulties: 
see 
that 
youhandle 
those 
aswell. 


Philosopher: 
To 
whatdifficultiesareyou 
referring? 



Theologian: 
Here 
are 
the 
main 
ones: 
If 
God 
delights 
in 
everyone’s 
happiness, 
why 
doesn’t 
He 
make 
everyone 
happy? 
If 
He 
loves 
everyone, 
why 
does 
He 
damnsomany? 
IfGod 
isjust,why 
doesHeseemsounfair,makingoutofthe 
same 
clay 
(as 
it 
were) 
some 
vessels 
for 
honour 
and 
others 
for 
shame? 
And 
if 
God 
knowingly 
allows 
and 
tolerates 
sin 
in 
the 
world, 
when 
He 
could 
eliminate 
it, 
isn’t 
He 
then 
responsible 
for 
the 
sin? 
Indeed, 
isn’t 
God 
the 
instigator 
of 
all 
sin, 
since 
He 
created 
everything 
such 
that 
sin 
would 
result? 
And 
what 
of 
free 
will, 
given 
the 
necessity 
of 
sin, 
and 
what 
of 
the 
justice 
of 
punishment, 
if 
free 
will 
doesn’t 
exist? 
What 
of 
the 
justice 
of 
rewards, 
if 
grace 
alone 
distinguishes 
the 
damned 
from 
the 
blessed? 
Lastly, 
if 
God 
is 
ultimately 
responsibleforeverything,whatcanweascribetopeopleand 
devils? 


Philosopher: 
I 
feelburiedunderthisavalancheofquestions! 


Theologian: 
So 
let’s 
take 
them 
one 
at 
a 
time. 
Don’t 
you 
agree, 
above 
all, 
that 
everything 
hasareason? 


Philosopher: 
I 
agree 
with 
that 
so 
strongly 
that 
I 
think 
it 
can 
be 
proven 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
(at 
least 
for 
an 
all-knowing 
being) 
to 
give 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
everything, 
i.e. 
explain 
why 
each 
thing 
exists 
rather 
than 
not 
and 
why 
it 
is 
soand-
so 
and 
not 
otherwise. 
Whoever 
denies 
this 
overthrows 
the 
dividing 
line 
between 
what 
is 
and 
what 
is 
not. 
Whatever 
exists 
has 
at 
least 
everything 
needed 
for 
existence; 
and 
everything 
needed 
for 
existence, 
taken 
together, 
constitute 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
existence. 
Therefore, 
whatever 
exists 
has 
a 
sufficientreasonforexistence. 


Theologian: 
I 
have 
nothing 
against 
this 
proof, 
or 
rather, 
this 
supposition 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
or 
even 
against 
its 
practical 
application. 
For 
all 
men, 
when 
they 
experience 
something, 
particularly 
if 
it 
is 
unusual, 
ask 
“why?”; 
that 
is, 
they 
demand 
a 
reason 
for 
it, 
and 
either 
the 
immediate 
cause, 
or 
the 



originator’s 
intention, 
if 
the 
originator 
is 
a 
rational 
being. 
From 
the 
word 
“why?” 
[cur] 
come 
the 
words 
“concern” 
[cura] 
and 
“curiosity” 
[curiositas], 
just 
as 
the 
word 
“to 
ask” 
[quaerere] 
comes 
from 
the 
words 
“who?” 
[quis]and 
“what?” 
[quae]. 
And 
when 
given 
its 
reason, 
if 
they 
have 
time 
and 
the 
trouble 
seems 
worth 
it, 
people 
seek 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
given 
reason, 
and 
so 
on, 
until 
(on 
the 
one 
hand) 
philosophers 
run 
into 
something 
self-evident, 
something 
necessary 
which 
is 
its 
own 
reason, 
or 
(on 
the 
other 
hand) 
ordinary 
people 
run 
into 
somethingfamiliarand 
commonplace,atwhichpointthey 
stop. 


Philosopher: 
There 
must 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
everything; 
otherwise, 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
sciences 
would 
be 
overthrown. 
For 
just 
as 
arithmetic 
and 
geometry 
(the 
sciences 
of 
quantities) 
have 
the 
first 
principle 
“The 
whole 
is 
greater 
than 
a 
part”, 
so 
“Everything 
has 
a 
reason.” 
is 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
physics 
and 
ethics, 
the 
sciences 
of 
qualities, 
or 
said 
another 
way, 
the 
sciences 
of 
action, 
thinking 
and 
motion, 
since 
a 
quality 
is 
a 
potential 
for 
changing 
and 
being 
changed. 
And 
surely 
you 
will 
admit 
that 
even 
the 
most 
trivial 
theorem 
of 
physics 
and 
ethics 
cannot 
be 
proven 
without 
assuming 
this 
proposition;moreover,theproofof 
God’sexistencerests 
onthis 
postulate. 


Theologian: 
OK,soyouadmitthateverythinghasa 
reason. 


Philosopher: 
Well, 
why 
shouldn’t 
I, 
although 
I 
don’t 
see 
where

tedious 
proofofthisobviousstatementis 
leading. 


Theologian: 
Pay 
attention 
for 
a 
minute 
and 
you’ll 
see 
what 
knotty 
problems 
derivefrom 
it. 
Now 
consider:Judaswasdamned. 


Philosopher: 
Whodoesn’tknowthat? 


Theologian: 
Wasn’titalsoforareason? 



Philosopher: 
Don’taskmethingswhich 
youknowIagreedtolongago. 


Theologian: 
Thenwhatwasthe 
reason? 


Philosopher: 
I 
think 
the 
reason 
was 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
dying 
man, 
namely 
the 
burning 
hatred 
of 
God 
in 
which 
he 
died, 
and 
of 
which 
the 
nature 
of 
despair 
consists. 
But 
that 
is 
enough 
to 
be 
damned. 
For 
since 
the 
soul 
is 
not 
open 
to 
new, 
external 
sensations 
after 
death, 
after 
its 
body 
has 
been 
returned, 
the 
soul 
sticks 
to 
its 
last 
thoughts. 
These 
do 
not 
change 
but 
are 
intensified 
in 
death. 
But 
hating 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
Most 
Happy, 
leads 
to 
the 
greatest 
pain, 
since 
“to 
hate” 
is 
to 
be 
pained 
by 
the 
hated 
one’s 
happiness, 
just 
as 
“to 
love” 
is 
to 
delight 
in 
the 
beloved’s 
happiness. 
Therefore, 
if 
God’s 
happiness 
is 
the 
greatest, 
so 
is 
Judas’ 
pain. 
The 
greatest 
pain 
is 
wretchedness, 
or 
rather 
damnation;therefore, 
hewhohatesGodindeath,damnshimself. 


Theologian: 
But 
where 
does 
his 
hatred 
for 
God 
come 
from, 
or 
rather 
his 
desire 
tocauseGodharm? 


Philosopher: 
From 
the 
assumption 
that 
God 
hates 
him, 
or 
bears 
him 
ill-will. 
For 
it 
is 
so 
astonishingly 
arranged 
by 
Providence 
that 
God 
in 
the 
end 
only 
harms 
those 
who 
fear 
Him 
like 
a 
slave, 
or 
rather, 
who 
take 
for 
granted 
that 
He 
will 
harm 
them; 
whereas 
whoever 
constantly 
believes 
himself 
preferred 
byGod,makeshimselfso,becausehelovesGod 
constantly. 


Theologian: 
ButwhydidJudasbelievethatGodbore 
himill-will? 


Philosopher: 
Because 
he 
knew 
himself 
to 
be 
a 
rebel, 
he 
believed 
God 
to 
be 
a 
tyrant; 
knowing 
himself 
to 
be 
fallen, 
he 
believed 
God 
would 
not 
forgive 
him; 
knowing 
himself 
to 
be 
malicious, 
he 
believed 
God 
to 
be 
cruel; 
knowing 
himselfbarrenof 
goodthings,hebelieved 
Godunjust. 



Theologian: 
You 
could’ve 
said 
it 
more 
succinctly: 
Judas 
was 
both 
penitent 
and 
despairing 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
But 
how 
did 
his 
soul 
come 
to 
this 
sorry 
state? 


Philosopher: 
I 
can 
tell 
you 
will 
never 
stop 
questioning 
me! 
Judas 
was 
penitentbecausehe 
knew 
himself,and 
despairing, 
becausehe 
wasignorantof 
God. 
He 
knew 
that 
he 
had 
sinned, 
and 
he 
believed 
that 
God 
would 
punish 
him; 
because 
God 
made 
him 
a 
rational 
being, 
he 
knew 
that 
he 
had 
sinned, 
for 
it 
was 
true. 
He 
had 
sinned 
in 
betraying 
his 
Teacher 
because 
he 
had 
been 
able 
to 
and 
because 
he 
had 
wanted 
to. 
God 
provided 
that 
Judas 
had 
been 
able 
to 
sin;andJudashadwantedto 
becauseitseemedgood. 


Theologian: 
But 
why 
did 
he 
think 
something 
evil 
was 
good? 
Likewise, 
after 
seeinghis 
mistake, 
whydidhedespair? 


Philosopher: 
Here 
we 
must 
look 
into 
the 
reasons 
for 
Judas’ 
beliefs, 
since 
even 
despair 
is 
a 
belief 
about 
something. 
Every 
belief 
has 
two 
causes: 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
believer 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
his 
belief. 
I 
do 
not 
take 
other 
pre-existing 
beliefs 
into 
account, 
since 
they 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
belonging 
to 
either 
the 
believer’s 
disposition 
or 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
belief, 


i.e. 
the 
state 
of 
the 
individual 
believer 
and 
the 
circumstances 
of 
things. 
Therefore, 
one 
cannot 
give 
the 
exact 
reason 
for 
Judas’ 
misguided 
beliefs 
without 
detailing 
all 
the 
states 
of 
his 
mind, 
unaffected 
by 
objects, 
all 
the 
way 
backto 
his 
firstdispositionatbirth. 
Theologian: 
Aha! 
This 
is 
where 
I 
bring 
you 
up 
short. 
Sin 
comes 
from 
the 
ability 
to 
sin 
and 
the 
desire 
to 
sin. 
The 
ability 
is 
provided 
by 
God, 
whereas 
the 
desire 
comes 
from 
a 
belief 
about 
something 
and 
this 
belief 
comes 
from 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
believer 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
belief. 
But 
both 
of 
these 
last 
two 
elements 
come 
from 
God 
as 
well, 
so 
everything 



responsible 
for 
sin 
comes 
from 
God. 
Therefore, 
God 
is 
ultimately 
responsible 
for 
sin 
and 
damnation, 
just 
as 
for 
everything 
else. 
You 
see 
what 
follows 
from 
that 
axiom 
“Everything 
has 
a 
reason.” 
Of 
course, 
you 
have 
prudently 
said 
that 
everything 
which 
is 
its 
own 
reason 
for 
existence 
cannot 
be 
further 
resolved 
into 
a 
reason 
and 
a 
reason 
for 
that 
reason, 
etc. 
such 
as 
can 
be 
done 
for 
every 
sin 
and 
damnation. 
In 
the 
end, 
however, 
all 
these 
reasons 
resolve 
into 
that 
which 
is 
its 
own 
reason, 
i.e. 
self-subsistent 
existence, 
or 
God. 
This 
proofcorrespondsto

God’sexistence.

was 
fruitful. 
For 
if 
I 
have 
learned 
anything 
with 
certainty 
in 
today’s 
discussion, 
it 
is 
that 
if 
one 
turns 
to 
God, 
or 
rather 
withdraws 
from 
the 
sensesandleads 
themind 
back 
into 
itself 
(which 
is 
really 
the 
same 
thing), 
if 
one 
tries 
to 
find 
the 
truth 
with 
sincere 
disposition, 
then 
the 
shadows 
are 
parted 
as 
if 
by 
a 
blast 
of 
unexpected 
light, 
and 
in 
the

the

Theologian: 
You 
soundlikeonewhohasbeeninitiatedintomysteries. 


Philosopher: 
You 
will 
be 
the 
judge 
of 
what 
I 
have 
to 
say. 
I 
cannot 
deny 
that 
God 
is 
ultimately 
responsible 
for 
everything, 
and 
consequently 
is 
the 
driving 
forcebehindsin. 


Theologian: 
If 
youconcedethat, 
youconcedeeverything. 



Philosopher: 
Not 
so 
fast! 
No, 
I 
say, 
I 
cannot 
deny 
it, 
because 
it 
is 
certain. 
Take 
away 
God, 
and 
you 
take 
away 
this 
whole 
chain 
of 
events; 
establish 
Him, 
and 
you 
likewise 
establish 
it. 
This 
chain 
of 
events 
includes 
all 
the 
creatures 
which 
have 
been 
and 
will 
be, 
their 
good 
and 
evil 
actions 
and 
hence, 
theirsins. 
Nevertheless,Idenythat 
Godwillsthosesins. 


Theologian: 
So 
you 
propose 
that 
sins 
occur, 
not 
because 
God 
wills 
them, 
but 
becauseHe 
exists. 


Philosopher: 
You 
have 
hit 
the 
nail 
on 
the 
head! 
For 
although 
God 
has 
caused 
sins 
to 
happen, 
He 
is 
certainly 
not 
their 
originator. 
If 
it 
may 
be 
permitted 
to 
speak 
so 
scholastically, 
the 
ultimate 
physical 
cause 
of 
sins, 
as 
of 
everything, 
lies 
in 
God, 
but 
the 
moral 
cause 
lies 
in 
the 
sinner. 
I 
believe 
this 
is 
what 
was 
meant 
by 
those 
who 
said 
that 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
deed 
comes 
from 
God, 
but 
not 
the 
evil, 
even 
if 
they 
couldn’t 
explain 
how 
the 
evil 
did 
not 
follow 
from 
the 
deed. 
More 
correctly, 
they 
should 
have 
said: 
God 
contributes 
everything 
to 
sin 
except 
the 
desire 
to 
sin, 
and 
consequently 
He 
does 
not 
sin. 
Thus, 
I 
feel 
that 
sins 
are 
not 
due 
to 
the 
divine 
Will, 
but 
rather 
to 
divine 
Reason, 
or 
to 
the 
eternal 
ideas 
of 
things, 
which 
are 
the 
same 
thing. 
These 
eternal 
ideas 
constitute 
the 
nature 
of 
everything, 
so 
one 
should 
not 
foolishly 
imagine 
that 
there 
are 
two 
basic 
elements 
of 
things 
and 
two 
gods, 
hateful 
to 
each 
other, 
one 
good,onebad. 


Theologian: 
Whatyou’resayingisastonishing. 


Philosopher: 
But 
I 
will 
make 
it 
so 
that 
you 
agree 
it’s 
true. 
Here’s 
an 
example 
which 
will 
make 
my 
point 
clearer 
and 
more 
believable. 
Why 
does 
three 
times 
three 
equal 
nine? 
Do 
we 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
because 
God 
wills 
it 
so? 
Or 
that 
the 
square 
root 
of 
two 
is 
an 
irrational 
number, 
should 
we 
conclude 
that 
God 
has 
willeditthus? 



Theologian: 
I 
think 
not, 
if 
we 
are 
wise; 
for 
nine 
and 
three 
and 
the 
square 
root 
of 
two 
are 
numbers 
which 
can 
be 
clearly 
grasped; 
they 
are 
not 
just 
names 
withno 
ideabehindthem. 


Philosopher: 
Thus, 
these 
theorems 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
these 
ideas 
like 
“nine” 
and 
the 
“square 
root 
of 
two” 
should 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
divine 
Reason, 
where 
the 
ideas 
of 
things 
have 
rested 
for 
eternity. 
In 
other 
words, 
these 
theorems 
are 
true 
because 
God 
reasoned 
them 
from 
the 
ideas 
of 
things, 
not 
because 
God 
willed 
them. 
Moreover, 
these 
ideas 
follow 
from 
God’s 
existence, 
for 
if 
God 
were 
nothing, 
everything 
would 
be 
simply 
impossible 
and 
ideas 
like 
“nine” 
and 
the 
“square 
root 
of 
two” 
would 
share 
the 
common 
nothingness. 
Thus, 
some 
things 
owe 
their 
existence 
to 
God’s 
existence, 
but 
nottoHisWill. 


Theologian: 
I 
see 
that, 
but 
what 
does 
this 
have 
to 
do 
with 
sins? 
I 
await 
your 
answerwithdesireandwonder. 


Philosopher: 
You 
perceive 
that 
I 
have 
not 
digressed 
in 
vain. 
For 
just 
as 
“three 
times 
three 
equals 
nine” 
owes 
its 
truth 
to 
God’s 
existence 
and 
not 
to 
His 
Will, 
so 
“the 
ratio 
of 
three 
to 
nine 
equals 
the 
ratio 
of 
four 
to 
twelve” 
also 
follows 
from 
His 
existence. 
Indeed, 
every 
ratio, 
proportion, 
analogy 
and 
proportionality 
arises 
not 
from 
God’s 
Will, 
but 
from 
His 
nature, 
or 
from 
the 
Ideasofthings,whichare 
the 
same 
thing. 


Theologian: 
And 
thenwhatfollows? 


Philosopher: 
Well, 
if 
this 
is 
true 
for 
ratios 
and 
proportions, 
then 
it 
is 
also 
true 
for 
harmony 
and 
discord. 
For 
they 
consist 
of 
the 
ratio 
of 
unity 
to 
diversity; 
harmony 
is 
unity 
among 
many 
things 
and 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
diversity 
of 



the 
things 
being 
unified. 
The 
greatest 
harmony 
brings 
seemingly 
chaotic 
things 
unexpectedlyintothe 
greatestconsonance. 


Theologian: 
Now 
I 
see 
what 
you’re 
driving 
at. 
It 
is 
the 
universal 
harmony 
which 
causes 
sins, 
since 
light 
must 
be 
set 
off 
with 
shadows. 
However, 
the 
universal 
harmony 
stems 
not 
from 
God’sWill,but 
from 
His 
Reason, 
or 
rather 
from 
the 
Ideas 
(or 
nature) 
of 
things. 
Therefore 
the 
existence 
of 
sins 
must 
be 
ascribed 
toGod’s 
reason;consequently, 
sinsfollowfromGod’s 
existence 
and 
notfromHisWill. 


Philosopher: 
You 
guessed 
it! 
For 
the 
whole 
chain 
of 
events 
would 
be 
completely 
changed 
if 
sins 
didn’t 
exist. 
But 
the 
chain 
of 
events 
follows 
directly 
from 
God’s 
existence, 
and 
cannot 
be 
otherwise. 
For 
to 
say 
that 
many 
different 
effects 
could 
follow 
from 
one 
complete 
and 
sufficient 
cause 
(as 
God 
is 
for 
the 
universe) 
is 
just 
as 
absurd 
as 
saying 
that 
one 
thing 
is 
many 
things. 
Plainly, 
if 
you 
add 
and 
subtract 
the 
same 
quantity 
from 
a 
number, 
the 
original 
number 
always 
comes 
out. 
But 
the 
chain 
of 
events 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
addition 
and 
subtractionofideas. 
Ifanyonestillopposesthis 
notion,areadyproofwill 
overcome 
his 
stubbornness. 
If 
God 
is 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
things, 
or 
rather, 
the 
self-sufficient 
existence 
and 
the 
first 
cause, 
then 
this 
chain 
of 
events 
follows 
necessarily 
from 
God’s 
existence. 
Otherwise, 
God 
would 
not 
be 
the 
sufficient 
reason, 
but 
something 
other 
than 
God 
would 
have 
a 
hand 
in 
establishing 
this 
chain 
of 
events; 
there 
would 
be 
two 
Gods 
(as 
the 
Manichaeans 
believed) 
or 
at 
least 
God 
would 
not 
be 
the 
sole 
self-sufficient 
existence 
and 
first 
cause, 
both 
of 
which 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
false. 
Therefore, 
this 
chain 
of 
events 
follows 
from 
God’s 
existence. 
Now 
it 
is 
well-known 
from 
the 
laws 
of 
logic 
that 
if 
the 
proposition 
“A 
implies 
B” 
is 
true, 
then 
so 
is 
the 
proposition, 
“The 
absence 
of 
B 
implies 
the 
absence 
of 
A.” 
Therefore, 
since 
we 
have 
just 
proven 
that 
God’s 
existence 
implies 
this 
chain 
of 
events, 
which 



includes 
sins, 
then 
one 
cannot 
remove 
the 
sins 
without 
removing 
God, 
which 
we 
wished 
to 
prove. 
So, 
sins 
and 
the 
whole 
chain 
of 
events 
follow 
logically 
from 
the 
ideas 
of 
things 
themselves, 
or 
rather 
from 
God’s 
existence: 
establish 
His 
existence, 
and 
these 
sins 
are 
established; 
remove 
the 
sins, 
and 
one 
must 
also 
removeGod’sexistence. 


Theologian: 
I 
admit 
the 
proof 
is 
adamantine, 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
attacked 
by 
any 
rationalmortal,no 
morethanthe 
proof 
of 
God’s 
existence. 
Butdoesn’t 
it 
also 
follow 
that 
everything, 
good 
things 
as 
well 
as 
sins, 
can 
be 
ascribed 
not 
to 
His 
will, 
but 
to 
God’s 
existence, 
or 
rather 
to 
the 
harmony 
of 
things, 
which 
amounts 
tothesamething? 
Anddoesn’titfollowthatsinsarenecessary? 


Philosopher: 
Let 
me 
hurry 
to 
answer 
the 
first 
question, 
and 
the 
second 
will 
be 
dealt 
with 
more 
easily. 
Why 
does 
God 
will 
something? 
It 
certainly 
isn’t 
arbitrary, 
since 
no 
one, 
least 
of 
all 
God, 
desires 
something 
for 
no 
reason, 
but 
because 
he 
thinks 
it 
beneficial 
somehow. 
God 
desires 
something 
because 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
which 
is 
of 
course 
contained 
in 
their 
own 
ideas, 
i.e. 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
God. 
But 
there 
are 
two 
reasons 
why 
God 
does 
something, 
just 
like 
everyone 
else: 
because 
He 
desires 
to 
do 
it 
and 
because 
He 
can 
do 
it. 
But 
God 
neither 
desires 
sins 
nor 
does 
them, 
since 
He 
doesn’t 
find 
them 
good 
in 
themselves. 
But 
God 
finds 
that 
sins 
mingle 
in 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
since 
Hehas 
chosenittobe 
themost 
harmonious;their 
presence 
in 
the 
whole 
chain 
of 
events 
is 
compensated 
by 
greater 
harmony. 
For 
this 
reason, 
God 
tolerates, 
or 
rather 
allows 
sins, 
although 
He 
would 
eliminate 
them, 
if 
He 
could 
craft 
another, 
better 
chain 
of 
events 
without 
them. 
But 
God 
does 
not 
merely 
allow 
the 
whole 
chain 
of 
events; 
He 
desires 
it 
and 
even 
the 
sins 
that 
come 
with 
it, 
insofar 
as 
they 
are 
not 
seen 
distinctly 
by 
themselves, 
but 
as 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
chain 
of 
events. 
God 
delights 
in 
the 
whole 
harmonious 
chain 
of 
events, 
but 
not 
in 
all 
of 
its 
individual 
parts. 
But 
wouldn’t 
God 
delight 
more 
in 
a 
chain 
of 



events 
without 
sin? 
On 
the 
contrary! 
He 
would 
delight 
less, 
because 
the 
delight 
of 
the 
universal 
harmony 
comes 
from 
being 
peppered 
with 
dissonancesandfromtheexquisitebalanceofits 
elements. 


Theologian: 
Your 
argument 
pleases 
me 
well, 
for 
you 
have 
shown 
beyond 
doubt 
that 
God 
is 
responsible 
for 
all 
that 
exists, 
and 
yet 
only 
desires 
those 
things 
which 
are 
good 
in 
themselves. 
But 
please 
address 
my 
second 
question. 
Doesn’t 
it 
follow 
that 
sins 
are 
necessary? 
For 
God’s 
existence 
is 
necessary, 
and 
the 
chain 
of 
events 
and 
sins 
follow 
from 
His 
existence, 
or 
equivalently, 
from 
the 
ideas 
of 
things; 
therefore, 
sins 
are 
also 
necessary. 
For 
whatever 
followsfromsomethingnecessaryis 
itself 
necessary. 


Philosopher: 
By 
the 
same 
argument, 
you 
could 
have 
inferred 
that 
everything 
is 
necessary, 
even 
that 
I 
am 
speaking 
and 
you 
are 
listening, 
since 
these 
things 
are 
also 
included 
in 
the 
chain 
of 
events. 
Indeed, 
you 
could 
have 
inferred 
even 
that 
nothing 
occurs 
by 
chance, 
except 
in 
the 
colloquial 
way 
used 
by 
the 
whole 
humanrace. 


Theologian: 
But 
a 
Stoic 
might 
well 
admit 
that, 
or 
some 
other 
proponent 
of 
destinyandfate. 


Philosopher: 
That 
should 
not 
be 
admitted; 
an 
abuse 
of 
language 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
this 
misconception, 
although 
it 
might 
be 
amended 
by 
adding 
an 
explanation. 
Even 
Christ 
says: 
“Offences 
will 
occur”, 
i.e. 
they 
are 
necessary. 
But 
offences 
are 
reckoned 
as 
sins, 
for 
the 
passage 
continues, 
“woe 
to 
him, 
who 
brings 
them 
to 
pass.” 
Thus, 
if 
offences 
are 
necessary, 
then 
this 
woe, 
i.e. 
damnation, 
is 
also 
necessary. 
But 
when 
speaking 
colloquially, 
one 
must 
be 
careful 
in 
expressing 
these 
conclusions. 
For 
a 
philosophical 
argument 
using 
everyday 
words 
like 
“necessary” 
can 
confuse 
those 
who 
don’t 
know 
their 
technicaldefinitions. 



Theologian: 
Butwhat’syour 
reply 
tothis 
question? 


Philosopher: 
The 
whole 
trouble 
springs 
from 
mis-using 
words; 
sloppy 
terminology 
makes 
our 
foundations 
shaky 
and 
leads 
us 
into 
impossible 
labyrinths. 
In 
particular, 
the 
words 
“necessary”, 
“possible”, 
“impossible”, 
“desire”, 
“cause” 
and 
others 
have 
so 
many 
different 
meanings 
in 
every 
language, 
it’s 
a 
kind 
of 
global 
sophistry. 
I’m 
not 
just 
saying 
this 
to 
be 
evasive, 
I’ll 
show 
you 
plainly. 
Leave 
out 
all 
those 
troublesome 
words 
in 
this 
discussion 
(for 
I 
think 
that 
if 
these 
words 
had 
been 
forbidden 
by 
decree, 
people 
could 
still 
give 
expression 
to 
their 
soul 
without 
them), 
and 
as 
often 
as 
you 
need 
to, 
substitute 
theirtechnical 
definitions. 
I’ll 
betyou 
anything 
that 
all 
the 
obscurities 
will 
immediately 
disappear; 
like 
exorcising 
a 
demon 
or 
turning 
on 
a 
light, 
every 
bogey-monster 
and 
spectre 
of 
difficulty 
will 
vanish 
into 
thin 
air. 
Look, 
this 
is 
not 
some 
trivial 
trick, 
but 
a 
wonderful 
method 
for 
clearing 
up 
errors, 
abuses 
and 
offences, 
a 
formula 
better 
than 
any 
doctor 
could 
prescribe. 
Urbanius 
Regius 
has 
written 
a 
whole 
book 
on 
methods 
for 
speaking 
wisely 
and 
diplomatically, 
but 
almost 
every 
rule 
is 
contained 
in 
this 
one 
cleverrule-of-thumb. 


Theologian: 
Comeon:howcansomething

Philosopher: 
Call 
me 
a 
prophet. 
There 
are 
certain 
words 
which 
are 
just 
vexing, 
annoying, 
irritating, 
aggravating 
and 
even 
torturing. 
If 
I 
were 
to 
say, 
“Sir, 
you 
are 
asserting 
something 
injurious 
to 
me, 
which 
you 
know 
is 
not 
so,” 
I 
don’t 
think 
you 
would 
be 
greatly 
offended, 
but 
would 
lightly 
overlook 
my 
presumption. 
But 
if 
I 
were 
to 
shout, 
“You’re 
a 
liar!”, 
immortal 
God, 
what 
a 
fuss 
youwould 
raise,although 
“a 
liar” 
is 
just 
someone 
who 
asserts 
something 
false 
which 
is 
injurious 
or 
unjust. 
Thus 
if 
someone 
says, 
“Sins 
are 
necessary, 
God 
is 
responsible 
for 
sin, 
it 
was 
impossible 
for 
Judas 
to 
avoid 
damnation, 



etc.” 
everyone 
gets 
up 
in 
arms! 
However, 
we 
may 
say 
more 
diplomatically 
(but 
equivalently) 
that 
God 
is 
ultimately 
responsible 
for 
everything, 
i.e. 
He 
is 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
the 
universe. 
This 
sufficient 
reason 
produces 
the 
most 
rational 
universe, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
universe 
of 
highest 
beauty 
and 
harmony. 
Yet 
the 
most 
perfect 
harmony 
is 
that 
which 
brings 
the 
most 
chaotic 
discord 
unexpectedly 
into 
order, 
just 
as 
a 
beautiful 
painting 
is 
composed 
of 
very 
light 
and 
dark 
patches 
wonderfully 
arranged, 
or 
as 
beautiful 
music 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
wonderful 
arrangement 
of 
consonances 
and 
dissonances. 
This 
universal 
harmony 
also 
arranges 
that 
the 
true 
punishment 
for 
a 
sin 
is 
simply 
the 
logical 
consequence 
of 
the 
sin 
itself. 
Therefore, 
it 
follows 
that 
sins 
and 
their 
punishment 
result 
from 
God’s 
existence. 
But 
to 
say 
that 
sins 
are 
logically 
necessary, 
or 
that 
God 
created 
or 
desired 
sin 
to 
exist, 
is 
unwiseandpoorlyreasoned,ascanbeseen

Theologian: 
You 
have 
revealed 
a 
truly 
marvelous 
insight, 
which 
resolves 
so 
many 
difficulties,

there 
seems 
no 
real 
reason 
to 
continue. 
Nevertheless, 
if 
it 
is 
possible, 
prove 
that 
which 
you 
did 
before, 
still 
using 
the 
words 
you 
find 
tobe 
poorlydefinedandabused. 


Philosopher: 
Were 
it 
in 
my 
power, 
I 
would 
make 
it 
so 
that 
people 
never 
used

for 
anything 
except 
that 
which 
concerned 
the 
honour 
of 
God 
and 
their

Philosopher: 
I 
will 
attempt

but 
only 
on 
the 
condition 
that 
whatever 
I 
say 
about 
those

which 
I 
have

we 
can 
do

will 
be

Theologian: 
Iagree 
tothiscondition. 



Philosopher: 
Ok, 
let 
me 
make 
some 
definitions. 
I 
call 
necessary 
something 
whose 
opposite 
involves 
a 
contradiction 
or 
cannot 
be 
conceived. 
For 
example, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
three 
times 
three 
equals 
nine, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
I 
speak 
or 
sin. 
For 
I 
can 
imagine 
myself 
as 
not 
speaking 
or 
not 
sinning, 
but 
to 
imagine 
that 
three 
times 
three 
does 
not 
equal 
nine 
involves 
a 
contradiction 
in 
the 
definitions 
of 
three, 
nine 
and 
“to 
multiply”. 
Everything 
which 
is 
not 
necessary 
is 
called 
contingent. 
This 
pair 
of 
opposites 
(necessary/contingent) 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
the 
pair 
(possible/impossible). 
Possible 
things 
are 
those 
things 
whose 
non-existence 
is 
not 
necessary; 
impossible 
is 
defined 
as 
everything 
which 
is 
not 
possible. 
More 
succinctly, 
“possible” 
describes 
everything 
which 
can 
be 
conceived, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
it’s 
necessary 
or 
contingent. 
The 
two 
pairs 
of 
definitions 
are 
related: 
something 
is 
necessary 
if 
its 
opposite 
is 
impossible, 
whereas 
something 
is 
contingent 
if 
its 
opposite 
is 
possible. 
To 
desire 
something 
is 
to 
delight 
in 
its 
existence. 
To 
abhor 
something 
is 
to 
suffer 
from 
its 
existence 
or 
to 
delight 
in 
its 
non-existence. 
To 
tolerate 
something 
is 
to 
be 
aware 
of 
something 
and 
yet 
neither 
desire 
nor 
abhor 
it. 
To 
instigate 
something 
means 
that 
one’s 
desire 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
its 
cause. 
Given 
these 
definitions, 
I 
dare 
to 
claim 
that 
not 
a 
single 
one 
of 
their 
consequences 
will 
wrest 
any 
honour 
from 
divine 
justice, 
evenbytorture. 


Theologian: 
So 
how 
do 
you 
reply 
to 
the 
argument 
we 
cited 
above, 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
is 
necessary 
and 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
chain 
of 
events, 
and 
thus 
of 
sins 
as 
well. 
Therefore, 
sins 
are 
necessary, 
since 
the 
logical 
consequences 
ofsomethingnecessaryis 
alsonecessary. 


Philosopher: 
Actually, 
it 
is 
not 
true 
that 
whatever 
follows 
from 
something 
necessary 
is 
also 
necessary 
in 
itself. 
For 
something 
contingent, 
i.e. 
something 
whose 
opposite 
is 
conceivable, 
can 
also 
follow 
from 
something 
necessary, 



just 
as 
particulars 
can 
follow 
from 
purely 
universal 
truths. 
But 
let 
me 
finish 
this 
proof 
with 
the 
definition 
of 
necessity. 
Something 
is 
necessary 
if 
its 
opposite 
is 
self-contradictory 
or 
cannot 
be 
conceived. 
Thus, 
the 
necessity 
of 
something 
is 
determined 
by 
its 
definition, 
not 
by 
its 
cause. 
In 
other 
words, 
something 
is 
necessary 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
itself, 
by 
containing 
within 
itself 
its 
own 
reason 
for 
existence 
and 
for 
its 
truth, 
like 
the 
truths 
of 
geometry. 
Yet 
of 
all 
existing 
things, 
only 
God 
is 
necessary; 
everything 
else 
is 
contingent, 
although 
they 
follow 
from 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
or 
rather 
from 
the 
established 
chain 
of 
events. 
These 
things 
are, 
so 
to 
speak, 
only 
“accidentally” 
necessary, 
although 
nothing 
happens 
by 
chance; 
Providence 
has 
established 
this 
chain 
of 
events 
and 
everything 
which 
exists 
is 
determined. 
Likewise, 
something 
can 
be 
possible, 
even 
if 
it 
doesn’t 
exist 
and 
never 
will, 
e.g. 
the 
unicorn. 
By 
our 
definition, 
anything 
which 
can 
be 
conceived 
is 
possible, 
even 
if 
it 
goes 
against 
existing 
things, 
the 
universal 
harmony 
or 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
which 
would 
preclude 
its 
existence. 
In 
such 
cases, 
it 
is 
“accidentally” 
impossible, 
but 
not 
impossible 
in 
itself. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
a 
big 
mistake 
to 
call 
absolutelyimpossiblethatwhich 
has 
neither 
been,noris, 
nor 
everwillbe. 


Theologian: 
But 
isn’t 
that 
true? 
Won’t 
everything 
which 
will 
be, 
be 
absolutely 
necessary, 
just 
as 
whatever 
was, 
was 
necessary 
and 
whatever 
is, 
is 
necessary? 


Philosopher: 
No, 
that’s 
completely 
wrong, 
unless 
we 
add 
a 
qualification 
to 
these 
statements, 
which 
people 
generally 
omit. 
The 
correct 
version 
is 
“Everything 
which 
is, 
is 
necessary, 
if 
it 
exists.” 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
existence 
of 
something 
is 
necessary 
only 
if 
we 
postulate 
its 
existence; 
then 
its 
nonexistence 
leads 
to 
a 
contradiction, 
as 
required 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
“necessary”. 
However 
if 
the 
postulating 
qualifier 
“if 
it 
exists” 
is 
left 
out, 
the 
statement 
is 
false, 
because 
anything 
which 
now 
exists 
can 
be 
imagined 
not 
to 



exist. 
Similarly, 
it 
can 
be 
imagined 
that 
anything 
which 
did 
happen, 
actually 
did 
not 
happen. 
This 
is 
the 
province 
of 
fine 
poets, 
who 
invent 
false 
stories, 
but 
nonetheless 
plausible 
ones. 
For 
example, 
Medea 
is 
a 
possible 
person, 
i.e. 
she 
can 
be 
imagined 
clearly 
and 
distinctly, 
but 
it 
certain 
that 
she 
never 
lived, 
and 
to 
my 
mind, 
will 
never 
live, 
unless 
one 
is 
of 
the 
heresy 
that 
every 
possibility 
will 
eventually 
come 
to 
pass 
in 
the 
infinite 
time 
remaining, 
so 
that 
every 
fairy-tale 
that 
can 
be 
dreamed 
will 
one 
day 
occur. 
Even 
if 
we 
were 
to 
grant 
that, 
the 
fact 
remains 
that 
Medea 
is 
possible, 
even 
though 
she 
has 
never 
existed. 
Those 
who 
think 
otherwise 
necessarily 
remove 
the 
division 
between 
possibility 
and 
truth, 
between 
necessary 
and 
contingent 
things; 
and 
by 
distorting 
the 
meanings 
of 
words, 
they 
run 
counter 
to 
the 
everyday 
usage 
of 
those 
words. 
Therefore, 
sins, 
damnations 
and 
other 
contingent 
things 
of 
this 
chain 
of 
events 
are 
not 
necessary, 
although 
they 
follow 
from 
something 
necessary, 
namely 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
and 
the 
harmony 
of 
things. 
Thus, 
even 
things 
which 
never 
have 
been 
and 
never 
will 
be 
and 
even 
things 
which 
are 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
all 
these 
things 
are 
possible, 
in 
that 
they 
can 
be 
imagined. 
Thus, 
itwas 
possiblefor 
Judas 
to 
be 
saved, 
since 
it 
can 
beimaginedwithoutself-contradiction, 
althoughthischainofevents 
(and 
thus 
theuniversalharmony)determinedthat 
his 
salvationwould 
nevercome. 


Theologian: 
Yet 
this 
usage 
has 
crept 
up 
on 
all 
peoples 
and 
into 
their 
languages 
and 
has 
grown 
strong 
by 
the 
general 
ambiguity, 
so 
that 
everything 
which 
actually 
exists, 
or 
has 
existed 
or 
will 
exist 
is 
called 
necessary, 
while 
everything 
which 
does 
not, 
has 
not 
and 
never 
will 
exist, 
are 
called 
impossible. 


Philosopher: 
But 
as 
I 
have 
shown, 
this 
is 
due 
to 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
qualifying 
phrase, 
which 
sounds 
like 
a 
repetition, 
to 
which 
everyone 
is 
prone, 
sincesaying 
thesamethingtwiceisboring. 



Theologian: 
Perhaps 
we 
ought 
to 
seek 
the 
true 
reason 
and 
solution 
to 
a 
lazy 
sophism, 
which 
has 
spread 
over 
all 
the 
Earth. 
For 
a 
long 
time 
now, 
Islamic 
philosophers 
have 
proposed 
something 
of 
great 
value 
to 
rulers 
facing 
the 
danger 
of 
war 
or 
pestilence: 
that 
resistance 
is 
futile, 
nothing 
can 
be 
done 
to 
help, 
since 
fate 
cannot 
be 
avoided. 
Things 
denied 
by 
heaven 
cannot 
be 
won 
bystriving,andthingsgrantedbyheavencanbegotten 
bytheidle. 


Philosopher: 
What 
you 
say 
is 
true. 
For 
this 
argument, 
so 
dreadful 
and 
firmly 
implanted 
in 
some 
spirits, 
is 
a 
mere 
sophism, 
which 
relies 
on 
leaving 
out 
the 
hypothetical 
nature 
of 
the 
cause 
and 
of 
what 
exists. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
everything 
which 
will 
be, 
will 
truly 
be, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary, 
not 
logically 
necessary, 
nor 
is 
what 
you 
do 
or 
not 
do. 
For 
an 
effect 
is 
not 
necessary 
unless 
the 
cause 
is 
postulated. 


Theologian: 
I 
usually 
rebuke 
those 
who 
are 
so 
dangerously 
delusional 
with 
these 
words: 
You 
moron, 
if 
Fate 
has 
decreed 
that 
you 
cannot 
avoid 
evil, 
perhapsyour 
stupidity 
is 
fated, 
too, 
sothatyou’renot 
carefulenough 
to 
avoid 
it! 
No 
one’s 
destiny 
is 
worked 
without 
a 
means, 
be 
it 
diligence 
or 
opportunities. 
One 
must 
trust 
in 
this 
alone, 
and 
take 
advantage 
of 
opportunities 
astheyoccur. 
Butyouask,isn’twhateverGodforesees 
certain? 
Whatever 
will 
be, 
will 
be. 
I 
admit 
that 
is 
so, 
but 
it 
requires 
a 
means 
and 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
it 
only 
occurs 
with 
your 
actions. 
For 
good 
fortune 
rarely 
heaps 
itself 
on 
a 
sleeper 
and 
laws 
are 
written 
for 
the 
watchful. 
Therefore, 
since 
you 
are 
unsure 
whether 
to 
believe 
in 
your 
free 
will 
or 
not, 
act 
as 
though 
you 
did, 


i.e. 
act 
as 
if 
nothing 
were 
decreed 
by 
fate, 
although 
you 
cannot 
really 
act 
on 
something 
completely 
unknown. 
Thus, 
if 
you 
carry 
out 
your 
task, 
whatever 
may 
happen 
by 
fate, 
or 
rather 
the 
harmony 
of 
things, 
will 
not 
be 
held 
against 
you 
by 
God. 
The 
whole 
debate 
over 
foresight, 
Fate, 
predestination 
and 
death 
doesn’t 
help 
in 
leading 
a 
life. 
Everything 
ought 
to 
be 
done 
in 
the 
same 
way, 

as 
if 
w 
didn’t 
think 
about 
these 
matters. 
If 
someone 
loves 
God 
constantly, 
then 
by 
that 
deed, 
he 
shows 
himself 
to 
have 
been 
predestined 
for 
salvation. 
Therefore, 
we 
can 
be 
saved 
if 
we 
desire 
it 
(and 
what 
more 
can 
we 
ask?) 
although 
itis

thatwedesireit. 


Philosopher: 
How 
very 
true! 
If 
only 
our 
debating 
scholars 
could 
be 
persuaded! 


Theologian: 
The 
question 
remains 
whether 
God 
desires 
sins 
or 
not. 
At 
first 
glance, 
it 
seems 
that 
God 
does 
not 
abhor 
sin. 
God 
is 
not 
grieved 
by 
anything 
which 
exists, 
for 
He 
cannot 
be 
grieved 
whatsoever. 
So 
the 
existence 
of 
sins 
does 
not 
grieve 
God, 
either. 
But 
he 
who 
is 
not 
grieved 
by 
something 
cannot 
abhor 
it. 
Therefore, 
God 
only 
abhors 
that 
which 
doesn’t 
exist; 
its 
nonexistence 
is 
pleasing 
to 
God. 
These 
conclusions 
follow 
from 
your 
own 
definitions. 


Philosopher: 
You 
have 
reached 
the 
right 
conclusion. 
As 
long 
as 
these 
sins 
are 
not 
considered 
by 
themselves, 
God 
does 
not 
abhor 
them. 
God 
tolerates 
sins 
which 
the 
universal 
harmony 
brings 
to 
pass, 
i.e. 
He 
neither 
desires 
them 
norabhorsthem. 


Theologian: 
I 
beg 
your 
pardon, 
but 
it 
seems 
that 
God 
does 
desire 
those 
sins. 
For 
the 
universal 
harmony 
is 
pleasing 
to 
God, 
and 
those 
sins 
are 
part 
and 
parcel 
of 
theuniversal 
harmony. 
Andby 
your 
definition, 
we 
desire 
something 
if 
wearedelightedby 
itsexistence. 
Therefore,God 
desiresthosesins. 


Philosopher: 
This 
line 
of 
reasoning 
is 
deceptive. 
Even 
if 
the 
whole 
harmony 
is 
pleasing, 
that 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
all 
of 
its 
parts 
are 
pleasing, 
too. 
It 
is 
not 
as 
though 
every 
part 
must 
be 
pleasing 
if 
the 
whole 
is 
to 
be 
pleasing. 
For 
example, 
good 
music 
contains 
dissonances 
which 
may 
be 
jarring 
by 



themselves, 
but 
which 
are 
blended 
with 
consonances 
to 
create 
a 
beautiful 
whole. 
The 
dissonances 
serve 
to 
create 
balance; 
the 
harmony 
tolerates 
these 
dissonances. 
But 
only 
the 
whole 
is 
pleasing; 
only 
the 
whole 
is 
harmonious. 
Likewise, 
the 
happiness 
of 
the 
saved 
delights 
God, 
while 
the 
happiness 
lacking 
in 
the 
damned 
does 
not 
grieve 
Him, 
since 
He 
is 
not 
grieved 
by 
anything. 
Thesorrow 
iserased 
bythe 
balanceoftheuniversalharmony. 


Theologian: 
You 
have 
indeed 
laid 
the 
greatest 
difficulty 
to 
rest, 
which 
is 
more 
than 
I 
hoped. 
You 
have 
shown 
(which 
hardly 
anyone 
has 
shown, 
to 
this 
day) 
that 
is 
reasonable 
to 
say 
that 
God 
neither 
desires 
nor 
abhors 
the 
sins 
which 
occur, 
but 
rathertolerates 
them. 


Philosopher: 
Soyou 
havenoobjections? 


Theologian: 
I 
can 
already 
see 
what 
you’re 
going 
to 
say 
about 
God 
being 
the 
instigatorofsins. 


Philosopher: 
Namely, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
God 
who 
desires 
sins, 
but 
rather 
the 
sinnersandthedevil; 
theyalonedelightinthesinitself. 


Theologian: 
Exactly: 
those 
who 
delight 
in 
the 
sin 
are 
its 
true 
instigators. 
For 
otherwise, 
it 
could 
be 
argued 
that 
people 
or 
the 
devil 
merely 
tolerate 
sins 
as 
well. 
It 
cannot 
be 
said 
of 
someone 
who 
commits 
a 
mortal 
sin 
that 
he 
was 
only 
doing 
what 
he 
had 
to 
and 
that 
he 
injured 
others 
out 
of 
necessity. 
Rather, 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
he 
hates 
God, 
i.e. 
the 
universal 
good 
and 
therefore 
delights 
in 
sin 
and 
contrariness. 
But 
what 
of 
someone 
who 
commits 
a 
venial 
sin 
out 
of 
ignorance, 
not 
out 
of 
malevolence? 
Shouldn’t 
we 
say 
that 
he 
merely 
tolerates 
hissin? 



Philosopher: 
We 
may 
not 
even 
say 
this. 
By 
its 
definition, 
“to 
tolerate” 
is 
to 
neither 
desire 
nor 
abhor. 
But 
this 
definition 
also 
requires 
that 
one 
be 
aware 
of 
the 
sin, 
which 
is 
not 
the 
case 
for 
this 
sinner. 
He 
desires 
that 
which 
makes 
up 
the 
sin, 
i.e. 
the 
deed; 
but 
he 
neither 
desires 
the 
sin 
itself 
nor 
tolerates 
it, 
since 
he 
is 
ignorant 
of 
it. 
God 
tolerates 
sins 
because 
He 
knows 
that 
those 
things 
which 
He 
permits 
are 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
common 
good, 
but 
that 
this 
dissonance 
is 
compensated 
in 
another 
way. 
Someone 
who 
commits 
a 
mortal 
sin 
knows 
that 
what 
he 
is 
doing 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
common 
good, 
as 
far 
as 
he 
can 
judge, 
which 
cannot 
be 
reconciled 
except 
by 
his 
punishment. 
He 
hates 
this, 
and 
yet 
he 
desires 
the 
deed. 
He 
must 
hate 
the 
common 
good 
or 
God’s 
ruleoftheworld, 
andinsofar 
ashehatesthese,he 
sinsmortally. 


Theologian: 
You 
have 
completely 
satisfied 
me, 
and 
excellently 
acquitted 
God 
of 
desiring 
sins. 
Let 
me 
summarize 
your 
argument. 
We 
commit 
sins 
because 
we 
are 
able 
to 
and 
because 
we 
want 
to. 
Our 
ability 
to 
sin 
stems 
not 
only 
from 
what 
we 
were 
born 
with, 
but 
also 
from 
things 
we 
have 
picked 
up. 
Since 
the 
former 
come 
from 
our 
parents, 
and 
the 
latter 
from 
our 
environment, 
our 
ability 
to 
sin 
is 
caused 
by 
external 
things. 
Likewise, 
our 
desire 
to 
sin 
is 
caused 
by 
our 
beliefs 
about 
the 
sin, 
which 
in 
turn 
results 
from 
our 
perception 
of 
the 
sin, 
which 
itself 
derives 
from 
the 
sin 
itself. 
So 
both 
our 
ability 
and 
desire 
to 
sin 
are 
caused 
by 
external 
things, 
i.e. 
by 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things. 
But 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things 
was 
caused 
by 
the 
preceding 
state, 
which 
was 
caused 
by 
the 
one 
preceding 
that, 
and 
so 
on. 
So 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
chain 
of 
events, 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
eternal 
and 
unchanging 
ideas. 
These 
ideas 
are 
contained 
in 
God’s 
mind 
and 
stem 
from 
themselves, 
not 
from 
God’s 
will; 
God 
did 
not 
conceive 
these 
ideas 
because 
He 
desired 
them, 
but 
because 
He 
exists. 
Therefore, 
although 
sins 
are 
not 
pleasing 
in 
themselves, 
sins 
are 



tolerated 
by 
God’s 
will 
because 
of 
the 
universal 
harmony 
which 
could 
not 
be 
establishedwithoutthem. 


Philosopher: 
Sowhatdoyoustill 
objectto? 


Theologian: 
Actually, 
quite 
a 
bit; 
we 
certainly 
haven’t 
resolved 
all 
the 
difficulties. 
For 
what 
does 
it 
matter 
if 
we 
reconcile 
sins 
with 
divine 
goodness, 
if 
sins 
cannot 
be 
reconciled 
with 
our 
freedom? 
What 
good 
does 
it 
do 
to 
acquit 
God, 
if 
the 
guilty 
are 
acquitted 
with 
Him? 
How 
do 
we 
profit, 
if 
in 
releasing 
the 
divine 
will, 
we 
render 
every 
will 
powerless? 
For 
I 
ask 
you, 
what 
is 
human 
freedom, 
if 
everything 
we 
are 
is 
the 
result 
of 
external 
things, 
if 
all 
our 
desires 
are 
determined 
by 
them, 
if 
a 
predestined 
logical 
sequence 
rules 
over 
our 
thoughts,themereby-productofinteractingatoms? 


Philosopher: 
Please 
don’t 
get 
worked 
up 
over 
an 
idea 
which 
is 
widely 
misunderstood 
and 
poorly 
expressed. 
We 
agreed 
before, 
as 
you 
yourself 
proposed, 
that 
everything 
had 
a 
sufficient 
reason; 
so 
of 
course, 
every 
act 
of 
desiring 
something 
also 
has 
its 
sufficient 
reason. 
This 
sufficient 
reason 
must 
either 
be 
external 
to 
the 
act 
itself, 
or 
it 
must 
lie 
in 
the 
act 
itself; 
however, 
in 
the 
latter 
case, 
that 
would 
make 
the 
act 
of 
desiring 
a 
self-sufficient 
existence, 
which 
is 
only 
true 
of 
God. 
Therefore, 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
desiring 
something 
is 
external. 
To 
discover 
what 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
is, 
we 
must 
consider 
what 
“to 
desire” 
is. 
Whatdoes 
itmeanto 
desiresomething? 


Theologian: 
To 
delight 
in 
its 
existence, 
as 
you 
prudently 
defined 
it 
before, 
whether 
we 
think 
itexistsorwhetherwejustimagine 
itsexistence. 


Philosopher: 
But 
to 
delight 
is 
to 
experience 
harmony, 
as 
we 
said 
before; 
therefore, 
everything 
we 
desire 
seems 
harmonious 
somehow. 
But 
whether 
something 
appears 
harmonious 
depends 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
perceiver, 
the 



object 
and 
the 
medium 
between 
them. 
So 
although 
we 
can 
do 
whatever 
we 
desire, 
our 
desires 
are 
not 
arbitrary; 
we 
only 
desire 
things 
which 
we 
believe 
to 
be 
good 
or 
pleasing. 
But 
our 
beliefs 
are 
not 
arbitrary, 
either; 
no 
one 
has 
ever 
managed 
to 
make 
himself 
disbelieve 
something 
he 
knows 
to 
be 
true, 
no 
matter 
how 
much 
he 
wished 
otherwise. 
Therefore, 
since 
beliefs 
do 
not 
result 
from 
desires, 
neither 
do 
desires 
result 
from 
desires. 
And 
even 
if 
we 
could 
make 
ourselves 
wish 
something 
merely 
because 
we 
wanted 
to, 
what 
causes 
our 
desire 
to 
wish 
it? 
Is 
it 
because 
of 
yet 
another 
desire, 
and 
so 
on 
to 
an 
infiniteseries 
ofdesires;orisitcompletelyrandom,i.e. 
fornoreason 
atall? 


Theologian: 
I 
cannot 
answer 
your 
reasoning, 
but 
I 
don’t 
see 
you 
answering 
myobjectionthat 
our 
freewillislost,either. 


Philosopher: 
I 
admit 
it, 
if 
you 
define 
free 
will 
the 
way 
some 
people 
do: 
that 
it 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
act 
or 
not 
act, 
given 
everything 
necessary, 
both 
externally 
and 
internally,forthedeed. 


Theologian: 
Is 
thatdefinitionwrong? 


Philosopher: 
In 
a 
word, 
yes 
— 
if 
no 
explanation 
is 
given. 
Saying 
that 
something 
(in 
this 
case, 
an 
action) 
does 
not 
exist 
while 
all 
of 
its 
requirements 
exist 
is 
like 
saying 
that 
a 
word 
can 
still 
be 
undefined 
even 
after 
its 
definition 
has 
been 
given, 
or 
even 
like 
saying 
that 
something 
exists 
and 
does 
not 
exist. 
If 
something 
does 
not 
exist, 
one 
of 
its 
requirements 
must 
be 
missing, 
because 
everything 
isdeterminedby 
alloftherequirementsforits 
existence. 


Theologian: 
Then 
the 
correct 
definition 
is: 
Free 
will 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
act 
or 
not 
toact, 
givenallthe 
external 
things 
necessary 
for 
the 
deed. 



Philosopher: 
In 
other 
words, 
by 
this 
definition, 
I 
can 
forego 
an 
action 
if 
I 
do 
not 
desire 
it, 
even 
if 
everything 
external 
is 
conducive 
to 
it. 
Nothing 
is 
more 
true, 
or 
in 
more 
perfect 
agreement 
with 
my 
philosophy. 
Even 
Aristotle 
defines 
an 
action 
to 
be 
“spontaneous”, 
when 
its 
cause 
lies 
within 
the 
agent, 
and 
to 
be 
“free”, 
when 
it 
is 
spontaneous 
by 
choice. 
Thus, 
the 
more 
spontaneous 
someone 
is, 
the 
more 
his 
actions 
flow 
from 
his 
nature, 
and 
the 
less 
he 
is 
influenced 
by 
external 
things. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
a 
person 
is 
more 
free, 
the 
more 
capable 
of 
choice 
he 
is, 
i.e. 
the 
more 
he 
perceives 
things 
with 
a 
clear 
and 
quiet 
mind. 
Spontaneity 
comes 
from 
one’s 
ability, 
whereas 
freedom 
comes 
from 
knowledge. 
But 
given 
that 
we 
have 
a 
good 
opinion 
of 
something, 
wecannothelp 
butdesireit; 
likewise,we 
cannot 
helpbut 
dosomething, 
if 
we 
desire 
it 
and 
recognize 
the 
opportunity. 
Nothing 
is 
more 
strange 
than 
to 
mutate 
the 
idea 
of 
free 
will 
into 
the 
incredible, 
even 
absurd, 
ability 
to 
act 
for 
no 
reason 
whatsoever. 
The 
privilege 
of 
free 
will 
consists 
of 
standing 
at 
the 
crossroads 
of 
life 
and 
only 
doing 
what 
we 
desire; 
and 
we 
can 
only 
desire 
what 
we 
consider 
good. 
But 
since 
we 
can 
find 
out 
what 
is 
good 
for 
us 
by 
using 
our 
reason, 
we 
shouldn’t 
find 
fault 
with 
Nature, 
that 
she 
should’ve 
givenusaweird 
abilityofacertain 
“rational 
irrationality”. 


Theologian: 
But 
there 
are 
some 
who 
claim 
they 
have 
such 
freedom, 
that 
they 
can 
do 
something 
or 
not, 
knowingly 
and 
with 
forethought, 
but 
for 
no 
reason 
whatsoever. 


Philosopher: 
I 
say 
this 
is 
just 
a 
matter 
of 
deceive 
or 
be 
deceived. 
These 
people 
don’t 
like 
to 
think 
that 
their 
desires 
result 
from 
external 
things; 
and 
the 
pleasure 
they 
get 
from 
defying 
that 
idea 
motivates 
them. 
But 
their 
desires 
donotderive 
fromthemselves. 



Theologian: 
But 
suppose 
that 
I 
were 
about 
to 
make 
a 
hand 
gesture; 
can’t 
I

Theologian: 
Sowhy

Philosopher: 
Subtle 
reasons 
are 
undoubtedly 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
it. 
Perhaps 
it 
came 
to 
your 
head 
first, 
because 
you 
saw 
it 
first. 
Perhaps 
your 
hand 
is 
accustomed 
to 
that 
direction, 
or 
perhaps 
the 
movement 
is 
more 
troublesome 
in 
the 
other 
direction. 
Such 
an 
act 
results 
from 
all 
sorts 
of 
little 
circumstances,so

Theologian: 
But 
if 
you, 
or 
an 
angel, 
or 
even 
God 
were 
to 
predict 
in 
which 
direction 
I 
were 
to 
move 
it, 
then 
I 
would 
move 
it 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction 
and 
assertmy 
freedom,thoughtheprophetwereunwilling. 


Philosopher: 
But 
you 
wouldn’t 
be 
more 
free 
because 
of 
that, 
for 
now 
the 
pleasure 
of 
contradiction 
has 
caused 
your 
desire. 
You 
see, 
if 
you 
always 
do 
the 
opposite 
of 
what’s 
predicted, 
an 
infallible 
prophet 
could 
predict 
that 
as 
well, 
as 
long 
as 
he 
never 
told 
you 
beforehand. 
He 
could 
either 
foresee 
it 
silently,or 
tellittoathirdpartywithoutyour 
knowledge. 


Theologian: 
So 
he 
can’t 
tell 
me 
the 
truth 
beforehand? 
But 
why 
not, 
if 
he 
has 
foreseen 
thetruth: 
for 
everyone 
who 
knows 
something 
true 
cantell 
it 
to 
every 
listener. 
But 
I 
will 
do 
the 
opposite 
of 
whatever 
he 
says; 
therefore, 
he 
does 
not 
foresee 
what 
I 
will 
do, 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
hypothesis. 
So 
either 
foresight 
orfreewillmustbe 
eliminated. 


Philosopher: 
This 
argument 
is 
subtle 
insofar 
as 
it 
concludes 
that 
if 
a 
certain 
mind 
always 
does 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
is 
predicted 
of 
it, 
no 
matter 
by 
whom, 



then 
such 
a 
mind 
contradicts 
the 
existence 
of 
an 
all-knowing 
being, 
or 
rather, 
the 
harmony 
of 
things. 
Therefore, 
such 
a 
mind 
has 
never 
existed, 
does 
not 
existandwillnotexist. 


Theologian: 
But 
what 
do 
you 
have 
to 
say 
about 
the 
well-known 
verse: 
“I 
see 
whatis 
good,andIapprove 
it,butstillI 
choosetodo 
the 
more 
evil.” 


Philosopher: 
This 
verse 
is 
absurd 
given 
our 
definitions, 
so 
it 
should 
be 
interpreted. 
Medea, 
who 
says 
these 
words 
according 
to 
Ovid, 
means 
to 
say 
that 
she 
sees 
the 
injustice 
of 
butchering 
her 
own 
children, 
but 
nevertheless, 
the 
pleasure 
of 
revenge 
on 
their 
father 
prevails 
over 
the 
horror 
of 
the 
crime, 
just 
as 
a 
greater 
good 
may 
prevail 
over 
evil. 
In 
other 
words, 
Medea 
sins 
against 
her 
conscience. 
“Good” 
and 
“evil” 
in 
this 
verse 
stand 
for 
“just” 
and 
“shameful”; 
no 
one 
should 
conclude 
from 
this 
verse 
that 
anyone 
ever 
deliberately 
chooses 
that 
which 
he 
considers 
altogether 
worse. 
Whoever 
thinks 
the 
opposite 
overturns 
all 
ethical 
principles 
and 
can’t 
even 
say 
what 
“todesire” 
means. 


Theologian: 
You 
havejustaboutconvincedme. 


Philosopher: 
We 
human 
beings 
are 
so 
stupid; 
we 
ask 
for 
self-contradictory 
chimeras, 
despising 
the 
privileges 
of 
nature 
and 
God, 
not 
contenting 
ourselves 
with 
the 
use 
of 
our 
reason, 
the 
true 
root 
of 
all 
freedom. 
Unless 
we’re 
given 
the 
power 
of 
unreasonableness, 
we 
never 
consider 
ourselves 
free 
enough! 
As 
if 
it 
were 
not 
the 
highest 
freedom 
to 
use 
our 
reason 
and 
desires 
as 
best 
as 
possible, 
with 
circumstances 
causing 
our 
reason 
to 
recognize 
truly 
goodthings,andourreasoncausingourdesiresto 
reachforthem. 
Then 
truths 
would 
not 
be 
resisted; 
by 
their 
reason, 
people 
would 
see 
things 
as 
they 
are. 
For 
if 
passions 
are 
absent, 
it 
is 
just 
as 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
knowingly 
make 
a 
mistake 
or 
willfully 
commit 
a 
sin, 
as 
it 
would 
be 
for 
a 
person 
with 
healthy 



eyes 
to 
not 
see 
an 
elephant. 
Certainly 
God’s 
freedom 
is 
the 
greatest, 
although 
even 
He 
cannot 
make 
a 
mistake 
in 
choosing 
the 
best; 
the 
freedom 
of 
angels 
is 
next 
best, 
provided 
that 
they 
don’t 
fall. 
In 
short, 
freedom 
comes 
from 
using 
one’s 
reason; 
in 
this 
chain 
of 
events, 
we 
either 
walk 
like 
kings 
along 
the 
path 
of 
our 
responsibilities, 
or 
we 
stagger 
along 
untrodden 
paths, 
according 
to 
whether 
our 
reasonis 
clearorcloudy. 


Theologian: 
Thus,everysinfollowsfroman

Philosopher: 
Granted. 


Theologian: 
Thenallsinsoughttobeforgiven. 


Philosopher: 
Not 
in 
the 
least, 
for 
just 
as 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
dark 
room, 
light 
may 
leak 
in 
through 
a 
crack, 
we 
have 
the 
power 
to 
evade 
sin, 
if 
we 
only 
desire 
touseit. 


Theologian: 
Butwhydo 
some 
desireto 
useit,andothers 
not? 


Philosopher: 
Because 
it 
doesn’t 
occur 
to 
them 
that 
they 
could 
profit 
by 
it. 
Or 
rather, 
such 
people 
seem 
to 
lack 
thoughtfulness 
and 
attention, 
for 
they 
see, 
but 
do 
not 
observe; 
they 
hear 
but 
do 
not 
listen. 
This 
brings 
the 
refusal 
of 
grace, 
or 
as 
the 
holy 
scriptures 
say, 
the 
beginnings 
of 
a 
hardened 
heart. 
Everyone 
among 
us 
has 
heard 
a 
thousand 
times, 
“Tell 
me 
why 
you 
are 
doing 
this!” 
or 
“Consider 
the 
outcome!” 
or 
else 
“Think 
about 
your 
actions!” 
And 
yet, 
if 
only 
one 
of 
these 
thoughts 
were 
properly 
understood 
and 
always 
borne 
in 
mind, 
everyone 
would 
be 
immediately 
changed, 
becoming 
infallible, 
wise 
and 
happy. 
When 
fully 
appreciated, 
such 
thoughts 
have 
more 
power 
than 
all 
theparadoxesoftheStoics’ 
wiseman. 



Theologian: 
So, 
in 
the 
end, 
oughtn’t 
all 
evil 
people 
be 
considered 
unfortunate, 
since 
they 
don’t 
perceive 
the 
way 
to 
their 
own 
happiness, 
which 
is 
(apparently)so 
easyandstraightforward? 


Philosopher: 
Truly. 


Theologian: 
And 
oughtn’tthey 
bepitied 
aswell? 


Philosopher: 
Undeniably. 


Theologian: 
And 
isn’ttheirmisfortune 
responsiblefortheirevil? 


Philosopher: 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
their 
own 
desire 
isn’t 
responsible 
for 
what 
they 
desire. 
As 
we 
just 
proved, 
the 
chain 
of 
events 
— 
or 
rather, 
the 
universal 
harmony 
— 
isresponsible 
for 
theirdesires,as 
for 
everythingelse. 


Theologian: 
Soaren’ttheylikeinsanepeople? 


Philosopher: 
That 
is 
almost 
true, 
but 
not 
quite. 
For 
like 
drunken 
or 
sleeping 
people, 
insane 
people 
cannot 
ask 
themselves 
“Why 
am 
I 
doing 
this?” 
(in 
which 
all 
wisdom 
is 
contained). 
Even 
if 
it 
did 
occurto 
them, 
they 
could 
never 
keep 
it 
in 
their 
heads. 
But 
stupid, 
mistaken 
and 
malicious 
people 
use 
their 
wits, 
albeit 
not 
towards 
the 
highest 
goal. 
Insane 
people 
are 
confused 
by 
a 
sickness 
which 
infects 
their 
nerves 
and 
spirits. 
But 
stupid 
and 
malicious 
people 
are 
motivated 
by 
a 
different 
rationale, 
one 
which 
warps 
reason 
and 
makes 
the 
better 
seem 
worse, 
a 
rationale 
which 
is 
inculcated 
by 
temperment, 
education 
and 
habit. 
Angels 
surely 
regard 
evil 
people 
just 
as 
dumb 
as 
we 
consider 
retardedpeople. 


Theologian: 
At 
least 
they 
are 
like 
those 
born 
on 
the 
fourth 
day 
after 
a 
new 
moon, 
or 
who 
were 
poorly 
educated, 
seduced 
by 
bad 
company, 
ruined 
by 
sex 



or 
made 
savage 
by 
adversity. 
They 
cannot 
deny 
that 
they 
are 
wicked, 
but 
they 
havereason 
toblame 
fortune 
andotherpeople. 


Philosopher: 
That’s 
generally 
so; 
or 
rather, 
it 
must 
be. 
For 
no 
one 
makes 
himselfevil 
bychoice;otherwise,he’dbe 
alreadyevil. 


Theologian: 
But 
now 
we 
need 
spirit 
and 
a 
strong 
heart, 
for 
we 
have 
reached 
the 
greatest 
difficulty 
without 
even 
realizing 
it. 
If 
your 
luck 
holds 
even 
here, 
you 
will 
be 
triumphant. 
Here 
is 
the 
problem,one 
which 
we 
can’t 
avoid. 
There 
seems 
to 
besome 
justice 
tothe 
claims 
ofthe 
damned, 
that 
they 
couldnot 
help 
but 
sin, 
given 
the 
way 
they 
were 
born, 
the 
way 
they 
were 
brought 
up, 
and 
the 
times 
and 
people 
and 
opportunities 
they 
happened 
upon. 
They 
cry 
that 
corrupting 
thoughts 
engaged 
their 
minds 
too 
early, 
that 
circumstances 
nurtured 
evil 
and 
goaded 
them 
to 
sin; 
or 
that 
the 
circumstances 
which 
would’ve 
freed 
them 
and 
held 
them 
back 
from 
sin 
were 
lacking, 
as 
though 
Fate 
had 
conspired 
to 
destroy 
them. 
Certain 
helpful 
warnings 
can 
awaken 
us 
if 
we 
grasp 
them 
correctly, 
like 
“Why 
are 
you 
doing 
this?” 
or 
“Consider 
the 
consequences!” 
But 
if 
the 
damned 
heard 
such 
warnings, 
they 
still 
lacked 
the 
needed 
thoughtfulness 
and 
attention, 
the 
wisdom 
which 
is 
the 
greatest 
gift 
of 
grace. 
How 
unfair 
it 
is 
that, 
although 
all 
people 
sleep, 
only 
a 
few 
are 
awakened 
and 
others 
are 
left 
to 
be 
destroyed! 
Even 
if 
it 
were 
necessary 
that 
so 
many 
creatures 
should 
be 
lost, 
that 
the 
chain 
of 
events 
could 
not 
be 
otherwise,at 
leastone 
shouldletofftheunfortunatesinners. 


Philosopher: 
Well, 
the 
situation 
is 
the 
same 
regardless 
of 
whether 
things 
happenbychance,bydeadlyFate 
orbytheuniversalharmony. 


Theologian: 
Please 
don’t 
interrupt 
until 
I’m 
finished. 
How 
cruel 
it 
is 
for 
someone 
to 
look 
unfeelingly 
upon 
the 
suffering 
which 
he 
created! 
It 
is 
like 
a 
bad 
father 
who 
has 
children 
and 
gives 
them 
the 
worst 
education, 
and 
then 



punishes 
them, 
although 
he 
ought 
to 
be 
punished 
himself. 
The 
damned 
curse 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
since 
it 
causes 
other 
beings 
to 
prosper 
from 
their 
damnation; 
the 
damned 
curse 
God, 
since 
He 
rejoices 
at 
their 
expense; 
and 
they 
curse 
themselves, 
because 
they 
know 
that 
they 
can 
never 
find 
oblivion. 
Theycurse 
theuniversal 
chainofevents, 
which 
entangled 
them 
in 
sin. 
Lastly, 
they 
curse 
the 
eternal 
and 
unchangeable 
ideas 
which 
determine 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
and 
with 
it, 
their 
existence 
and 
their 
sins. 
They 
curse 
these 
ideas, 
because 
they 
brought 
forth 
a 
universe 
which 
uses 
their 
misery 
to 
set 
off 
the 
happinessofothers. 


Philosopher: 
The 
complaint 
is 
tragic 
enough, 
but 
not 
equally 
just. 
I’ll 
prove 
this 
to 
you 
not 
only 
with 
sure 
signs, 
but 
also 
with 
solid 
reasoning, 
provided 
God 
(whom 
this 
debate 
concerns) 
gives 
me 
strength 
and 
spirit. 
This 
complaint 
is 
truly 
empty, 
even 
if 
you 
appraise 
it 
knowing 
that 
it 
only 
one 
of 
the 
damned 
could 
make 
it. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
this 
complaint 
cannot 
be 
made 
by 
someone 
not 
yet 
damned 
but 
damnable, 
i.e. 
one 
who 
might 
be 
damned 
in 
the 
future. 
Imagine 
to 
yourself 
a 
damnable 
person, 
and 
place 
before 
his 
eyes 
and 
soul 
the 
horrors 
and 
depths 
of 
hell, 
point 
out 
his 
little 
corner 
which 
will 
be 
his 
for 
all 
eternity, 
destined 
for 
his 
torments, 
if 
he 
acts 
damnably. 
Can 
anyone 
living 
see 
all 
this 
and 
afterwards 
complain 
about 
the 
causesofhisdamnation,andGodand 
the 
natureofthings? 


Theologian: 
Well, 
at 
least 
he 
won’t 
be 
able 
to 
then, 
because 
one 
could 
immediately 
reply 
thathecouldyetsave 
himself, 
ifheonlywantedto. 


Philosopher: 
That’s 
exactly 
what 
I 
wanted 
to 
hear! 
Let’s 
assume 
that, 
despite 
his 
foreknowledge 
of 
hell, 
this 
person 
continues 
on 
his 
way 
and 
is 
accordingly 
damned. 
Will 
he 
be 
able 
to 
repeat 
his 
complaints 
with 
any 
justice 



whatsoever? 
Will 
he 
be 
able 
to 
impute 
his 
misery 
to 
anything 
except 
his 
own 
desire? 


Theologian: 
You’veoverwhelmedmemorethan 
persuaded 
me. 


Philosopher: 
I 
will 
make 
it 
so 
that 
you 
will 
be 
persuaded 
as 
well, 
once 
you 
haveclearlyunderstoodmyargument. 


Theologian: 
I 
concede 
that 
this 
sinner 
will 
impute 
his 
sins 
to 
his 
own 
desires, 
but 
he 
will 
also 
impute 
those 
desires 
to 
fortune, 
i.e. 
God, 
or 
at 
least, 
as 
you 
like 
tosay,tothenatureofthings. 


Philosopher: 
I’ve 
told 
you 
already 
that 
the 
opposite 
implies 
a 
contradiction; 
no 
one 
willingly 
makes 
himself 
evil, 
else 
he 
were 
already 
evil. 
No 
one 
is 
the 
ultimate 
cause 
of 
their 
own 
desires, 
for 
whatever 
one 
desires 
to 
desire, 
one 
desires 
already, 
just 
as 
having 
the 
ability 
to 
do 
something 
also 
involves 
having 
the 
ability 
of 
having 
the 
ability, 
as 
our 
legal 
textbooks 
put 
it. 
But 
if 
this 
excuse 
is 
accepted, 
then 
punishment 
ought 
to 
be 
eliminated 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
things:no 
oneisevil,no 
oneought 
tobe 
punished,for 
everyonehas 
this 
excuse. 


Theologian: 
So,what 
now? 


Philosopher: 
Well, 
in 
judicial 
matters, 
the 
only 
requirement 
for 
inflicting 
punishment 
is 
the 
determination 
that 
the 
criminal 
acted 
with 
a 
deliberate, 
malicious 
will. 
Yet 
those 
who 
fault 
the 
divine 
justice 
seem 
to 
be 
demanding 
more 
for 
punishment 
than 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
sinner’s 
desire, 
which 
seems 
ridiculous. 


Theologian: 
Youhave 
convincedme 
that 
notthe 
leastshadow 
of 
anexcuse 
is 
left 
for 
sinners. 
They 
have 
nothing 
to 
find 
fault 
with, 
but 
they 
still 
have 



reason 
to 
be 
indignant. 
Or 
rather, 
they 
have 
cause 
to 
complain, 
but 
nothing 
to 
complain 
about, 
like 
a 
dog 
angered 
by 
a 
stone, 
or 
an 
inept 
gambler 
at 
his 
bad 
luck, 
or 
a 
desperate 
man 
against 
himself. 
These 
seem 
like 
good 
models 
of 
the 
anger 
of 
the 
damned 
against 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
the 
eternal 
ideas 
which 
brought 
about 
this 
particular 
chain 
of 
events. 
It 
is 
truly 
a 
stupid 
anger, 
like 
one 
who 
makes 
an 
adding 
mistake 
and 
who 
discovers 
upon 
checking 
his 
work 
that 
it 
doesn’t 
agree, 
and 
then 
flies 
into 
a 
rage 
against 
arithmetic 
and 
not 
against 
himself, 
regretting 
that 
three 
times 
three 
actually 
equals 
nine 
instead 
of 
ten. 
But 
the 
universal 
harmony 
arises 
from 
such 
fundamental, 
unchangeable 
ideas 
like 
three 
and 
nine. 
Thus, 
such 
people 
have 
an 
anger 
with 
no 
object, 
suffering 
from 
which 
they 
cannot 
escape, 
and 
a 
complaint 
that 
they 
can 
neither 
get 
rid 
of 
nor 
make 
acceptable 
to 
themselves. 
Truly, 
these 
are 
enormous 
additions 
to 
the 
raging 
wretchedness 
with 
which 
damnation 
ismainlyseasoned. 


Philosopher: 
Excellent! 
Their 
suffering 
has 
no 
escape, 
which 
is, 
if 
one 
may 
express 
it 
so, 
perversely 
almost 
pleasing 
to 
them, 
although 
they 
cannot 
make 
their 
complaints 
acceptable 
to 
themselves. 
This 
was 
the 
conclusion 
with 
which 
I 
wanted 
to 
convince 
you. 
However, 
I 
add 
that 
no 
one 
is 
ever 
actually 
damned 
from 
all 
eternity; 
rather 
they 
are 
always 
damnable; 
they 
are 
always 
able 
to 
be 
freed, 
but 
they 
never 
desire 
it. 
Therefore, 
since 
their 
own 
conscience 
protested 
in 
their 
sins, 
they 
are 
contradictory 
if 
they 
fault 
with 
the 
natureofthings. 


Theologian: 
Nowyouaretalkinginriddles. 


Philosopher: 
Orinparadoxes,as 
some 
mightsay. 


Theologian: 
It 
doesn’t 
matter 
which 
— 
we’re 
alone, 
put 
your 
cards 
on 
the 
table. 



Philosopher: 
If 
you 
had 
been 
observant, 
you 
would’ve 
noticed 
that 
I 
have 
already 
put 
them 
on 
the 
table. 
You 
remember 
how 
a 
little 
while 
ago, 
we 
talked 
aboutthenatureofamortalsinandaboutthe 
reasonfordamnation. 


Theologian: 
Pleaseremind 
meandshowhowitapplies 
here. 


Philosopher: 
You 
don’t 
remember 
what 
I 
replied 
when 
you 
asked 
for 
the 
reason 
of 
Judas’ 
damnation? 
Those 
enlightening 
words 
bear 
repeating. 
You 
asked 
me, 
“What 
was 
the 
reason 
for 
his 
damnation?” 
to 
which 
I 
replied, 
“The 
reason 
was 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
dying 
man, 
namely 
the 
burning 
hatred 
of 
God 
in 
which 
he 
died.” 
For 
since 
the 
soul 
is 
not 
open 
to 
new, 
external 
sensations 
after 
death 
(when 
the 
body 
is 
returned) 
the 
soul 
sticks 
to 
its 
last 
thoughts. 
These 
do 
not 
change, 
but 
are 
intensified 
in 
death. 
But 
hating 
God, 
Who 
is 
the 
happiest 
being, 
leads 
to 
the 
greatest 
pain, 
since 
hatred 
means 
to 
suffer 
pain 
because 
of 
the 
hated 
one’s 
happiness, 
just 
as 
love 
means 
to 
rejoice 
in 
the 
beloved’s 
happiness. 
Since 
God’s 
happiness 
is 
the 
greatest 
of 
all, 
so 
is 
Judas’ 
pain; 
and 
the 
greatest 
pain 
is 
damnation. 
Therefore, 
a 
dying 
person 
who 
hates 
God, 
damns 
himself 
by 
his 
own 
hatred. 
I 
think 
this 
is 
pretty 
close 
to 
a 
proof, 
for 
it 
renders 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
wretchedness 
equal 
to 
the 
magnitude 
of 
thehatred, 
whichin 
turnequals 
the 
magnitudeof 
thething 
hated. 


Theologian: 
But 
now 
you 
have 
broadened 
the 
scope 
of 
your 
argument: 
for 
now 
you’re 
saying 
that 
evil 
people 
are 
never 
damned, 
but 
are 
always 
damnable. 


Philosopher: 
I 
understand 
that 
to 
mean 
that 
whatever 
changes 
cannot 
stay 
the 
same. 
So 
also 
evil 
people 
are 
never 
damned, 
for 
they 
can 
stop 
being 
damnable 
whenever 
they 
desire 
it. 
In 
other 
words, 
they 
damn 
themselves 
frommomenttomoment. 



Theologian: 
I’dlike 
tosee 
that 
proved. 


Philosopher: 
It’s 
pretty 
easy! 
The 
hatred 
of 
God 
is 
what 
damns 
someone; 
thus, 
by 
continuing 
or 
intensifying 
his 
hatred, 
he 
continues 
or 
intensifies 
his 
own 
damnation. 
Likewise, 
the 
blessed, 
once 
they 
have 
been 
accepted 
into 
God, 
i.e. 
the 
highest 
reason, 
and 
have 
perceived 
the 
universal 
harmony 
all 
at 
once, 
may 
still 
increase 
their 
joy 
by 
reflecting 
more 
precisely 
on 
the 
elements 
of 
their 
joy; 
for 
thought 
and 
desire 
would 
come 
to 
a 
standstill 
without 
constant 
novelty 
and 
progression. 
So 
it 
is 
also 
with 
the 
damned, 
the 
furious 
haters 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things: 
the 
more 
they 
learn 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
the 
more 
enraged 
they 
become 
with 
new 
indignation, 
hatred, 
envy 
and 
in 
a 
word, 
withinsanity. 


Theologian: 
You 
illustrate 
your 
hypotheses 
clearly, 
but 
let 
me 
ask 
you 
two 
questions. 


Philosopher: 
Askmeahundred 
ifyouwish. 


Theologian: 
One 
of 
the 
questions 
is 
merely 
incidental, 
but 
the 
other 
is 
fundamental. 
You 
say 
that 
happiness, 
like 
unhappiness, 
grows 
continuously. 
But 
I 
don’t 
understand 
how 
the 
vision 
of 
the 
divine 
Essence 
can 
grow. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
the 
Essence, 
then 
it 
is 
exactly 
that 
and 
unchanging, 
and 
hence 
cannot 
grow. 


Philosopher: 
Even 
a 
complete 
conception 
can 
grow, 
not 
by 
adding 
to 
it, 
but 
by 
reflecting 
on 
it 
more 
deeply. 
For 
example, 
if 
you 
can 
grasp 
nine 
ones, 
you 
have 
grasped 
theessence 
of 
“nine” 
exactly. 
But 
that 
does 
notinclude 
allof 
its 
properties. 
That 
is, 
you 
can 
understand 
nine 
without 
realizing 
that 
it 
is 
three 
times 
three, 
or 
four 
plus 
five, 
and 
an 
infinity 
of 
other 
combinations. 
This 
analogy 
with 
nine 
is 
perhaps 
not 
apt, 
since 
it 
introduces 
other 
numbers, 



whereas 
God 
has 
nothing 
outside 
Himself 
with 
which 
He 
could 
be 
compared. 
A 
better 
example 
might 
be 
the 
circle, 
which 
is 
something 
finite 
with 
an 
infinity 
of 
properties 
within 
itself. 
For 
example, 
if 
you 
know 
that 
all 
lines 
from 
the 
center 
to 
the 
circumference 
have 
an 
equal 
length, 
then 
I’d 
say 
you 
had 
grasped 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
circle. 
But 
you 
have 
not 
exhausted 
all 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
circle. 
For 
example, 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
regular 
figures 
which 
can 
be 
drawn 
within 
the 
circle, 
which 
are 
fertile 
ground 
for 
new 
geometricaltheorems. 


Theologian: 
I 
must 
admit, 
I 
have 
often 
wondered 
what 
kind 
of 
pleasure 
lies 
in 
the 
blessed 
Vision, 
where 
the 
mind 
is 
astounded 
and 
forever 
maintains 
one 
unmoving 
gaze. 
Happily 
you 
have 
taken 
away 
the 
clouds 
and 
reconciled 
completeness 
with 
continual 
novelty. 
But 
this 
question 
was 
only 
incidental. 
The 
question 
I 
really 
wanted 
to 
ask 
was: 
where 
does 
this 
division 
of 
spirits 
come 
from? 
Why 
do 
some 
burn 
in 
love 
for 
God, 
while 
others 
are 
driven 
towards 
a 
hatred 
deadly 
to 
themselves? 
Where 
do 
they 
part 
ways, 
and 
what 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
root 
of 
the 
divergence? 
For 
we 
often 
believe 
the 
damnable 
tobe 
sosimilarto 
thesavablethatweconfusethem. 


Philosopher: 
What 
you 
ask 
of 
me 
is 
great, 
my 
friend, 
and 
even 
Philosophy 
itselfmightnot 
beequaltothetask. 


Theologian: 
Buttryitanyway. 
Forreasonmayprogressaslong 
asit 
provides 
itself 
with 
support. 
After 
all, 
up 
to 
this 
point 
in 
our 
whole 
discussion, 
you 
have 
not 
touched 
Revelation 
with 
profane 
hands, 
since 
you 
haven’t 
been 
initiated 
yet. 


Philosopher: 
I 
have 
meditated 
much 
on 
this 
subject, 
with 
the 
following 
results. 
You 
must 
realize 
that 
there 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
people 
in 
the 
world, 
just 
as 
there 
are 
in 
every 
nation: 
those 
who 
are 
satisfied 
with 
the 
present 
situation 



and 
those 
who 
hate 
it. 
Now 
the 
contented 
and 
neutral 
people 
go 
to 
work 
every 
day, 
seek 
to 
profit, 
to 
gather 
and 
increase 
their 
fortunes, 
friends, 
power, 
pleasures 
and 
fame; 
otherwise, 
they 
would 
be 
numb 
rather 
than 
satisfied. 
However, 
if 
their 
success 
is 
prevented 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
state, 
they 
don’t 
transfer 
their 
hatred 
to 
those 
laws 
nor 
do 
they 
suddenly 
desire 
to 
change 
things. 
Rather, 
they 
make 
new 
plans 
with 
a 
tranquil 
mind, 
no 
more 
upset 
than 
if 
they 
had 
missed 
a 
fly 
they 
had 
tried 
to 
swat. 
This 
frame 
of 
mind 
distinguishes 
good 
citizens 
from 
the 
bad 
ones, 
and 
is 
even 
more 
appropriate 
whendiscussingtheuniversalstate,whosegovernorisGod. 


Theologian: 
That’s 
certainly 
so, 
for 
even 
in 
the 
ideal 
state, 
whose 
fulfillment 
is 
beyond 
the 
dreams 
of 
men, 
one 
cannot 
prevent 
that 
its 
laws 
will 
occasionally 
limit 
the 
success 
of 
some 
of 
its 
citizens, 
or 
even 
bring 
misfortune 
on 
them. 
It 
is 
just 
for 
them 
to 
contemplate 
change, 
since 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
them. 
But 
in 
the 
universal 
state, 
whose 
ruler 
is 
God, 
the 
only 
miserableonesarethosewho 
want 
tobe. 


Philosopher: 
Therefore, 
in 
this 
world, 
no 
indignation 
at 
past 
offences 
is 
ever 
just; 
every 
disposition 
of 
the 
mind 
towards 
the 
past 
except 
tranquillity 
is 
in 
some 
way 
criminal. 
Thus, 
to 
want 
to 
suffer 
when 
you 
are 
denied 
something 
is 
a 
sin 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
hidden 
anger 
towards 
God 
and 
towards 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things,which 
dependson 
the 
chainofeventsandtheuniversalharmony. 


Theologian: 
But 
it’s 
impossible 
not 
to 
be 
disappointed, 
when 
something 
is 
deniedyou. 


Philosopher: 
Predilections 
of 
the 
mind 
are 
similar 
to 
urges 
of 
the 
body. 
But 
there 
are 
two 
types 
of 
urges: 
those 
which 
overcome 
all 
resistance 
and 
those 
which 
can 
be 
opposed 
by 
other 
drives. 
If 
you 
want 
to 
go 
from 
east 
to 
west, 
but 
also 
wants 
just 
as 
badly 
to 
go 
from 
west 
to 
east, 
then 
you 
will 
simply 



stand 
still. 
The 
first 
desire 
is 
not 
eliminated, 
but 
is 
neutralized 
by 
the 
opposing 
second 
drive. 
Thus, 
he 
whose 
desire 
has 
been 
frustrated 
cannot 
help 
feeling 
upset 
for 
a 
moment, 
but 
if 
he 
is 
satisfied 
with 
the 
overall 
direction 
of 
the 
world, 
he 
won’t 
persevere 
in 
his 
suffering. 
For 
he 
will 
recognize 
that 
everything 
is 
for 
the 
best, 
not 
only 
overall 
but 
also 
for 
him 
specifically; 
so 
everything 
turns 
to 
good 
for 
those 
who 
love 
God. 
Likewise 
one 
can 
assume 
that 
everyone 
hates 
God 
who 
are 
not 
pleased 
with 
His 
governing 
of 
the 
world, 
to 
whom 
it 
seems 
that 
God 
could’ve 
improved 
things, 
including 
those 
who 
argue 
for 
atheism 
from 
the 
disorder 
of 
the 
things. 
Thus, 
it 
seems 
that 
even 
atheists 
hate 
God; 
for 
whatever 
they 
may 
say 
or 
believe, 
if 
they 
are 
upset 
by 
the 
present 
state 
of 
things, 
they 
hate 
God 
by 
that 
very 
fact, 
even 
if 
theydon’tcallwhattheyhate 
“God”. 


Theologian: 
If 
this 
is 
our 
philosophy, 
then 
it 
is 
not 
lawful 
to 
work 
to 
improve 
things. 


Philosopher: 
Wrong 
indeed! 
It 
is 
not 
only 
lawful 
and 
just, 
but 
also 
necessary; 
otherwise, 
we 
would 
lapse 
into 
the 
fatalism 
we 
discussed 
above. 
Everyone 
who 
loves 
God, 
i.e. 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
ought 
to 
be 
contented 
with 
the 
past; 
since 
it 
cannot 
be 
undone, 
it 
was 
desired 
by 
God 
and 
was 
therefore 
for 
the 
best. 
But 
as 
for 
the 
future, 
nothing 
has 
been 
decided 
as 
far 
as 
we’re 
concerned, 
so 
there 
is 
still 
a 
place 
for 
conscience, 
industry 
and 
deliberation. 
When 
a 
lover 
of 
God 
is 
considering 
eliminating 
or 
correcting 
some 
evil 
situation, 
whether 
his 
own 
or 
another’s, 
whether 
public 
or 
private, 
his 
plans 
focus 
on 
correcting 
it 
in 
the 
future, 
not 
the 
past, 
say 
tomorrow. 
Tomorrow 
may 
pass 
without 
his 
plans 
succeeding, 
but 
this 
failure 
will 
not 
blunt 
or 
quench 
his 
desire 
for 
change. 
It 
is 
not 
for 
us 
to 
set 
deadlines 
for 
God; 
only 
those 
who 
persevere 
will 
be 
crowned 
with 
victory. 
In 
short, 
a 
lover 
of 
God 
should 
always 
consider 
the 
past 
good, 
but 
still 
strive 
to 
improve 
the 
future. 



Whoever 
is 
so 
disposed 
will 
achieve 
finally 
a 
tranquillity 
of 
the 
mind 
(which 
serious 
philosophers 
urge) 
and 
a 
complete 
surrender 
to 
God 
(which 
mystical 
theologians 
urge). 
Whoever 
thinks 
differently 
neither 
knows 
God 
(not 
recognizing 
that 
He 
is 
responsible 
for 
everything) 
nor 
loves 
Him, 
even 
if 
he 
uses 
the 
words 
like 
“faith”, 
“love”, 
“neighbour” 
and 
“God”. 
Moreover, 
no 
one 
ignorant 
of 
God 
can 
really 
love 
Him, 
although 
he 
can 
hate 
God 
nonetheless, 
by 
hating 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
world 
and 
the 
chain 
of 
events, 
since 
he 
who 
wishes 
to 
change 
these 
also 
wishes 
that 
God 
were 
different. 
Those 
who 
die 
dissatisfied, 
die 
hating 
God. 
The 
newly 
dead 
soul 
rushes 
headlong 
in 
the 
direction 
he 
began 
with 
after 
death, 
since 
nothing 
external 
holds 
him 
back; 
his 
senses 
are 
closed. 
He 
feeds 
his 
own 
soul 
with 
what 
he 
has 
within, 
with 
his 
own 
hatred 
of 
things, 
and 
with 
his 
own 
misery, 
disgust, 
indignation, 
envy, 
dissatisfaction, 
all 
of 
which 
ever 
increases. 
Then 
even 
were 
he 
reunited 
with 
his 
body, 
he 
would 
find 
new 
grounds 
for 
contempt, 
disapproval 
and 
anger. 
Indeed, 
the 
less 
he 
could 
check 
the 
rushing 
torrent 
of 
events 
displeasing 
him, 
the 
more 
he 
would 
be 
tormented. 
But 
such 
suffering 
almost 
becomes 
a 
perverse 
pleasure; 
the 
wretched 
almost 
delight 
to 
find 
that 
they 
are 
tormented. 
Even 
among 
the 
living, 
the 
unhappy 
slander 
the 
blessed 
whom 
they 
envy, 
for 
no 
other 
reason 
than 
to 
be 
indignant 
that 
such 
inept 
people 
(in 
their 
opinion) 
should 
possess 
so 
many 
good 
things. 
But 
thus 
they 
make 
their 
own 
torments 
more 
abundant 
and 
their 
pain 
more 
wild; 
they 
also 
distort 
their 
envy 
to 
make 
it 
seem 
more 
reasonable. 
Somehow, 
in 
aremarkable 
way,envy, 
indignation 
and 
dissatisfaction 
of 
this 
kind 
are 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
pleasure 
of 
suffering. 
For 
since 
they 
are 
pleased 
to 
think 
of 
themselves 
as 
wise, 
they 
suffer 
all 
the 
more 
keenly 
that 
they 
lack 
the 
power 
which 
they 
feel 
is 
their 
due; 
and 
what 
power 
they 
have, 
they 
feel 
is 
beneath 
their 
dignity. 
So 
there 
you 
have 
an 
explanation 
for 
an 
amazing 
paradox. 
I 
maintain, 
not 
only 
is 
no 
one 
damned 
unless 
they 
desire 
it, 
but 
also 
that 
no 
one 
remains 
damned 
unless 



they 
desire 
it. 
For 
no 
one 
is 
damned 
unless 
they 
damn 
themselves; 
the 
damned 
are 
never 
wholly 
damned, 
but 
always 
remain 
damnable. 
They 
are 
damnedbysuchastubbornnessandperversionoftheirdesires,sucha 
turning 
away 
from 
God, 
that 
their 
greatest 
delight 
is 
in 
having 
something 
which 
makes 
them 
suffer. 
They 
are 
always 
looking 
for 
a 
reason 
to 
become 
angry. 
They 
seem 
to 
have 
the 
madness 
of 
fury, 
but 
which 
is 
desired, 
despairing, 
uncurable 
and 
eternal. 
Therefore, 
the 
damned 
neither 
could 
nor 
would 
make 
the 
complaints 
which 
we 
ascribed 
to 
them 
before, 
i.e. 
that 
they 
would 
accuse 
nature, 
the 
universal 
harmony 
and 
God 
of 
being 
co-conspirators 
in 
creating 
theirmisery. 


Theologian: 
Immortal 
God! 
You 
have 
turned 
this 
paradox 
into 
a 
job 
well 
done! 
I 
can 
tell 
that 
this 
sort 
of 
explanation 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
Holy 
Fathers. 
I 
know 
of 
a 
simple, 
but 
wise 
fable, 
which 
nearly 
encompasses 
the 
intrinsic 
character 
of 
the 
damned. 
Once 
upon 
a 
time, 
there 
was 
a 
hermit, 
I’m 
not 
sure 
which 
one, 
who 
was 
almost 
intoxicated 
with 
profound 
contemplation. 
And 
one 
day, 
this 
hermit 
began 
to 
suffer 
gravely 
because 
so 
many 
creatures 
had 
to 
be 
damned. 
He 
approached 
God 
with 
his 
request, 
and 
demonstrating 
his 
sincerity, 
he 
asked, 
“O 
Father, 
how 
can 
You 
contemplate 
the 
destruction 
of 
so 
many 
of 
Your 
children 
with 
no 
sorrow? 
Oh, 
receive 
those 
miserable 
demons 
back 
into 
grace, 
those 
demons 
who 
drag 
so 
many 
souls 
down 
into 
the 
lower 
world 
with 
themselves.” 
Then 
the 
heavens 
and 
the 
tempests 
were 
calmed, 
and 
the 
Almighty 
One 
answered 
serenely, 
“My 
son, 
I 
see 
the 
simplicity 
of 
your 
heart; 
I 
understand 
well 
the 
exuberance 
of 
your 
good 
will, 
and 
I 
would 
gladly 
do 
it. 
I 
will 
forgive 
everyone 
who 
asks 
for 
forgiveness.” 
Then 
the 
adoring 
hermit 
said, 
“May 
You 
be 
blessed, 
Father 
of 
all 
mercy, 
inexhaustible 
Fountain 
of 
grace! 
And 
now, 
with 
Your 
permission, 
I 
will 
pay 
a 
visit 
to 
Old 
Nick 
and 
those 
other 
wretched 
ones, 
and 
tell 
them 
of 
this 
happy 
day.” 
The 
hermit 
went 
to 
the 
Prince 
of 
Devils, 
with 
whom 
he 
was 



well 
acquainted, 
interrupted 
him 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
conversation, 
and 
said, 
“Boy, 
this 
is 
your 
lucky 
day! 
The 
doors 
of 
salvation 
have 
been 
thrown 
open 
to 
welcome 
you, 
the 
doors 
which 
have 
been 
closed 
since 
almost 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
world! 
Now 
try 
to 
complain 
about 
the 
cruelty 
of 
God, 
Who 
was 
moved 
by 
the 
entreaty 
of 
a 
poor 
hermit, 
where 
the 
rebellions 
of 
so 
many 
ages 
failed!” 
But 
the 
Demon-Prince, 
outraged 
and 
menacing, 
said, 
“Excuse 
me, 
who 
made 
you 
our 
attorney? 
Who 
suckered 
you 
into 
believing 
in 
such 
stupid 
mercy? 
Listen,

That

Theologian: 
Our 
hermitsaidthesethingsandIagree 
withhim. 


Philosopher: 
With 
thisdelightfullittle 
story,you 
havebrightenedtheseverity 
of 
our 
argument, 
or 
rather, 
signed 
and 
sealed 
it 
with 
an 
epilogue. 
Now 
I 
think 
wecan 
safelyquit. 


Theologian: 
Let 
me 
ask 
one 
more 
question. 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
you 
have 
proven 
that 
the 
damned 
cannot 
complain 
about 
God, 
the 
world 
or 
anything 
else, 
and 
that 
they 
don’t 
even 
want 
to 
be 
able. 
But 
it 
is 
still 
apparent 
that 
God 
is 
doing 
a 
favour 
to 
the 
minds 
which 
are 
amazed 
by 
His 
unfathomable 



judgment, 
and 
even 
to 
Himself. 
I 
could 
probably 
figure 
this 
out 
for 
myself 
fromeverything 
we’veestablished,butI’dpreferto 
haveyou 
summarizeit. 


Philosopher: 
So 
what’s 
left 
to 
complain 
about? 
If 
the 
chain 
of 
events 
were 
not 
so, 
neither 
God 
nor 
a 
blessed 
soul 
could 
be 
blessed, 
or 
even 
exist, 
since 
thechain 
ofevents 
follows 
fromGod’sexistence. 


Theologian: 
I 
admit, 
no 
one 
can 
complain, 
but 
many 
might 
wonder 
about 
two 
things: 
first, 
why 
the 
system 
of 
the 
world 
was 
set 
up 
with 
damnations, 
and 
secondly, 
why 
one 
soul 
makes 
itself, 
even 
chooses 
to 
make 
itself 
more 
unhappy 
thananother. 


Philosopher: 
The 
first 
question 
is 
the 
easiest 
and 
the 
most 
difficult 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
It 
is 
the 
easiest, 
if 
you 
agree 
with 
my 
assertion 
that 
this 
world-
system 
is 
the 
best 
possible, 
and 
that 
it 
agrees 
with 
the 
universal 
harmony. 
Scholastically 
speaking, 
this 
can 
be 
proven 
a 
posteriori, 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
has 
happened. 
For 
it 
is 
undeniable 
that 
everything 
which 
exists 
is 
the 
best 
possible, 
or 
rather 
the 
most 
harmonious 
possible. 
The 
proof 
is 
that 
the 
first 
and 
only 
cause 
of 
what 
exists 
is 
God’s 
mind, 
since 
the 
goal 
of 
any 
mind 
is 
harmony 
and 
God’s 
mind 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
and 
harmonious. 
But 
if 
anyone 
is 
still 
unsatisfied 
with 
this 
line 
of 
reasoning, 
I 
cannot 
answer 
him; 
if 
he 
wants 
an 
a 
priori 
proof 
of 
this 
universal 
harmony, 
then 
he 
asks 
for 
something 
toodifficult 
foraman 
whohasnotyetseenthesecretvisionof 
God. 


Theologian: 
Would 
that 
the 
world 
were 
persuaded 
of 
what 
you 
have 
proven 
so 
irrefutably: 
if 
one 
views 
the 
universe 
as 
a 
whole, 
then 
whatever 
does 
exist 
is 
seen 
to 
be 
the 
best. 
If 
everyone 
believed 
this, 
we 
would 
surely 
have 
fewer 
sins, 
and 
if 
everyone 
bore 
it 
in 
mind, 
we 
would 
have 
none 
at 
all. 
Everyone 
would 
love 
the 
Creator 
and 
the 
mouth 
of 
atheists 
would 
be 
stopped. 
Those 
short-sighted 
critics 
of 
Providence 
would 
have 
to 
hold 
their 
tongues, 
they 



who 
rush 
to 
judge 
the 
whole 
melody 
based 
on 
a 
few 
notes. 
They 
don’t 
realize 
that, 
given 
the 
near 
infinity 
of 
things, 
or 
so 
to 
speak, 
in 
the 
reduplication 
of 
worlds 
within 
worlds 
(for 
space 
is 
infinitely 
divisible), 
no 
impure 
mortal 
can 
grasp 
the 
whole 
universe. 
They 
do 
not 
see 
that 
the 
interspersed 
dissonances 
make 
the 
consonance 
of 
the 
universe 
all 
the 
more 
exquisite, 
just 
as 
adding 
two 
odd 
numbers 
produces 
an 
even 
one. 
They 
do 
not 
grasp 
that 
it 
is 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
harmony 
to 
unify 
diverse 
elements 
wonderfully 
into 
an 
unexpectedly 
beautiful 
whole. 
Musical 
composers 
are 
not 
the 
only 
artists 
to 
practice 
this; 
so 
do 
the 
authors 
of 
stories 
intended 
to 
amuse, 
which 
we 
call 
novels. 
Nevertheless, 
there 
is 
still 
the 
question: 
since 
souls 
are 
initially 
all 
identical 
(before 
birth), 
and 
only 
become 
different 
through 
the 
external 
impressions 
which 
they 
receive, 
how 
does 
the 
initial 
choice 
occur? 
If 
they 
are 
all 
the 
same, 
why 
is 
one 
soul 
chosen 
to 
be 
exposed 
to 
corrupting 
influences, 
and 
another 
not? 
More 
generally 
but 
equivalently, 
why 
are 
identical 
souls 
placedin 
differingtimesand 
placesandcircumstances? 


Philosopher: 
This 
question 
seems 
difficult, 
but 
that’s 
more 
because 
of 
the 
warped 
way 
you 
asked 
it 
and 
less 
because 
it’s 
so 
problematic. 
Here 
we 
touch 
upontheextremelythornydiscussionof 
the 
principle 
of 
individuation,thatis, 
the 
problem 
of 
telling 
the 
difference 
between 
identical 
objects, 
i.e. 
objects 
which 
differ 
in 
location 
alone. 
For 
example, 
two 
eggs 
could 
be 
so 
similar 
that 
not 
even 
an 
angel 
could 
distinguish 
them 
(assuming 
they 
were 
perfectly 
alike) 
but 
who 
can 
deny 
that 
they 
are 
different 
eggs? 
At 
least 
they 
differ 
in 
that 
one 
egg 
is 
this 
egg 
here 
and 
the 
other 
is 
that 
egg 
there. 
Thus 
we 
distinguish 
them 
by 
specifying 
one 
egg 
as 
“this 
one” 
and 
the 
other 
as 
“that 
one”;inotherwords,they 
aredifferentbecausetheycan 
beassigneddifferent 
numbers 
(indexed). 
Counting 
is 
just 
specifying 
one 
object 
after 
another; 
so 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
whether 
we 
count 
“One, 
two, 
three,..” 
or 
whether 
we 
say 
“This 
one, 
and 
this 
one, 
and 
this 
one,..” 
This 
specification 
is 
equivalent 
to 



specifying 
the 
time 
and 
place 
of 
the 
egg. 
We 
could 
specify 
it 
by 
its 
motion 
relative 
to 
some 
object 
(like 
ourselves) 
or 
by 
a 
motion 
of 
our 
own, 
like 
pointing 
at 
it. 
Therefore, 
the 
specification 
of 
identical 
objects 
depends 
on 
something 
external 
and 
not 
on 
the 
identical 
things 
themselves. 
The 
only 
difference 
that 
an 
angel, 
or 
I 
daresay 
God 
Himself, 
could 
find 
between 
our 
two 
hypothetical 
eggs 
is 
that 
one 
is 
in 
position 
A 
and 
the 
other 
in 
position 
B. 
Now 
say 
you 
want 
to 
distinguish 
these 
eggs 
forever, 
given 
that 
you 
can’t 
paint 
them, 
or 
label 
them, 
or 
make 
any 
mark 
on 
them 
whatsoever: 
how 
could 
you 
do 
it? 
First, 
you 
could 
try 
keeping 
them 
motionless 
forever, 
so 
that 
the 
first 
egg 
would 
always 
be 
in 
position 
A 
and 
the 
other 
in 
position 
B. 
Secondly, 
you 
could 
fix 
them 
in 
a 
solid 
box, 
so 
that 
they 
would 
always 
keep 
the 
same 
orientation. 
Then 
by 
marking 
the 
box, 
you 
could 
track 
them. 
Lastly, 
if 
you 
let 
them 
go 
wherever 
they 
will, 
you 
would 
have 
to 
follow 
every 
single 
motion 
of 
theirswithyoureyes,handsorsomeotherformof 
contact. 


Theologian: 
You 
are 
saying 
astounding 
things, 
which 
I 
believe 
noneof 
of 
our 
scholars 
wouldeven 
dreamof,but 
which 
seems 
undeniableand 
taken 
straight 
from 
everyday 
life. 
Men 
do 
exactly 
as 
you 
say 
when 
they 
are 
trying 
to 
distinguish 
identical 
objects. 
But 
what 
can 
we 
conclude 
about 
souls 
from 
this 
discussion? 


Philosopher: 
We 
can 
conclude 
that 
souls, 
or 
as 
I 
like 
to 
call 
them, 
minds, 
are 
distinguished 
initiallyonlybytimeandposition,like 
our 
hypotheticaleggs. 
If 
this 
is 
conceded, 
the 
whole 
problem 
disappears. 
For 
to 
ask 
why 
this 
soul 
and 
no 
other 
was 
dropped 
into 
these 
circumstances, 
into 
this 
time 
and 
place 
(which 
determines 
that 
soul’s 
life 
and 
death, 
including 
its 
salvation 
and 
damnation) 
is 
to 
ask 
why 
this 
soul 
is 
this 
soul. 
For 
if 
all 
souls 
are 
initially 
identical, 
then 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
substitute 
one 
soul 
for 
another. 
That 
soul 
is 
equivalent 
to 
this 
soul. 
If 
a 
farmer’s 
son 
is 
indignant 
that 
he 
was 
not 



born 
the 
King’s 
son, 
then 
he 
is 
indignant 
in 
vain. 
For 
even 
if 
their 
souls 
had 
been 
switched 
before 
birth, 
everything 
would’ve 
turned 
out 
exactly 
the 
same: 
the 
farmer’s 
son 
would 
still 
envy 
the 
king’s 
son! 
This 
is 
what 
I 
reply 
to 
those 
who 
are 
indignant 
that 
God 
didn’t 
immediately 
replace 
Adam 
and 
Eve 
with 
better 
people 
after 
they 
fell, 
so 
that 
their 
original 
sin 
wouldn’t 
taint 
all 
their 
children. 
I 
admonish 
them, 
“If 
God 
had 
eliminated 
that 
sin, 
a 
completely 
different 
chain 
of 
events 
would 
have 
followed. 
There 
would 
have 
been 
completely 
different 
people, 
circumstances 
and 
marriages, 
and 
thus 
a 
completely 
different 
human 
race. 
So 
we 
would 
not 
even 
exist 
if 
that 
sin 
were 
removed.” 
Therefore, 
they 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
become 
indignant 
over 
Adam 
and 
Eve’s 
sin, 
and 
even 
less 
over 
God’s 
toleration 
of 
sin, 
since 
this 
is 
what 
brought 
about 
their 
existence 
in 
the 
first 
place. 
You 
see 
how 
people 
vex 
themselves 
with 
pointless 
questions. 
It’s 
like 
some 
half-blood 
nobleman 
becoming 
angry 
that 
his 
father 
married 
a 
peasant 
girl, 
without 
stopping 
to 
consider 
that 
had 
his 
father 
married 
another, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
been 
born, 
but 
some 
other 
person. 
Of 
course 
people 
get 
upset 
over 
things 
even 
more 
stupid 
thanthis. 


Theologian: 
I 
have 
nothing 
left 
to 
ask, 
criticize 
or 
object 
to. 
I 
am 
just 
amazed 
at 
the 
unexpected 
clarity 
of 
the 
whole 
matter. 
I 
would 
commend 
you 
more, 
didInotfearthat 
peoplewould 
think 
thatwehadsomesecret 
understanding. 


Philosopher: 
So 
let 
other 
people 
be 
the 
judge, 
as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
careful 
and 
intelligent 
and 
pay 
attention, 
as 
long 
as 
they 
employ 
our 
definitions 
and 
don’t 
bring 
in 
new 
ones, 
as 
long 
as 
they 
don’t 
twist 
my 
arguments 
into 
conclusions 
I 
would 
never 
dream 
of, 
and 
as 
long 
as 
they 
eschew 
malicious 
quibbling, 
which 
is 
the 
sign 
of 
a 
disturbed 
soul. 
Lastly, 
they 
should 
sincerely 
want 
to 
educatepeopleanddefendGod’sglory. 



Theologian: 
But 
even 
if 
you 
have 
made 
a 
mistake, 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
calumny 
and 
envy 
will 
never 
make 
anything 
heretical 
of 
it. 
They 
could 
never 
prove 
that 
someone 
who 
speaks, 
believes 
and 
even 
dies 
in 
this 
way, 
is 
damnable 
and 
not 
to 
be 
held 
as 
a 
son 
of 
the 
mother 
community 
the 
Church, 
or 
equivalently,asabrother. 


Philosopher: 
I 
believe 
that 
with 
certainty 
and 
supported 
by 
that 
hope, 
I 
commend 
myself 
to 
the 
Universal 
One, 
to 
the 
Church, 
to 
the 
Christian 
State, 
to 
the 
wisdom 
of 
antiquity 
and 
to 
the 
accepted 
way 
of 
thinking 
of 
our 
age, 
and 
lastly 
to 
everyone 
who 
reaches 
a 
correct 
conclusion. 
I 
cannot 
help 
being 
attacked, 
but 
I 
hope 
that 
my 
critics 
will 
not 
be 
prejudiced. 
For 
I 
hope 
that 
if 
one 
considers 
my 
arguments 
carefully 
and 
attentively, 
he 
will 
be 
convinced 
that 
my 
conclusions 
should 
be 
universally 
recognized 
as 
true. 
But 
I 
presume 
that 
he 
will 
dispense 
with 
verbal 
tricks 
to 
muddy 
the 
waters 
and 
confuse 
people 
more 
than 
the 
arguments 
themselves. 
Everything 
ought 
to 
be 
presented 
as 
simply 
as 
possible. 
Now 
I 
have 
said 
nothing 
of 
Christ’s 
benefits, 
of 
the 
help 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
and 
of 
the 
extraordinary 
cooperation 
of 
the 
divine 
Grace, 
since 
these 
are 
all 
matters 
of 
divine 
revelation. 
For 
we 
agreed 
among 
ourselves 
that 
I 
as 
a 
catechumen 
would 
expound 
first 
the 
theology 
of 
philosophers, 
and 
you 
would 
then 
introduce 
me 
to 
the 
mysteries 
of 
the 
revelation 
of 
Christian 
wisdom. 
This 
was 
to 
help 
you, 
Theophilus, 
as 
a 
teacher 
in 
recognizing 
what 
I 
already 
believe 
and 
acknowledge, 
and 
also 
to 
clarify 
the 
agreement 
between 
faith 
and 
reason. 
We 
showed 
how 
unreasonable 
are 
those 
people 
who 
sneer 
at 
religion 
because 
they 
are 
puffed 
up 
with 
knowledge, 
and 
also 
those 
who, 
made 
haughty 
by 
revelations, 
despisephilosophybecause 
itrevealstheirignorance. 


Theologian: 
I 
praise 
your 
modesty, 
and 
I 
appreciate 
how 
much 
I’ve 
profited 
from 
our 
conversation. 
I 
rejoice 
to 
glean 
sound 
arguments 
from 
you 
to 
stuff 



in 
the 
mouths 
of 
people 
of 
exceeding 
impudence, 
who 
are 
not 
moved 
by 
reverence 
for 
the 
sacred 
scriptures, 
nor 
by 
the 
consensus, 
authority 
and 
good 
example 
of 
the 
Holy 
Fathers. 
These 
people 
who 
make 
themselves 
stubborn 
for 
some 
reason 
are 
foolish, 
as 
you 
have 
shown 
more 
clearly 
than 
the 
noonday 
sun. 
The 
time 
will 
come 
(I 
foresee 
it 
and 
pray 
for 
it) 
when 
you 
will 
be 
evenbetter 
preparedfor 
greatertasks,once 
youhave 
studied 
the 
principles 
of 
our 
faith. 
The 
light 
of 
your 
reason 
will 
exorcise 
all 
the 
shadows 
and 
spectres 
of 
utterly 
vain 
difficulties, 
which 
confuse 
the 
soul 
and 
lead 
it 
astray. 
Farewell.

PREFACE. 



THE 
ESSAY 
ON 
theUnderstanding, 
by 
an 
illustrious 
Englishman, 
being 
one 
of 
the 
most 
beautiful 
and 
esteemed 
works 
of 
the 
time, 
I 
have 
resolved 
to 
make 
Remarks 
on 
it, 
because, 
having 
sufficiently 
meditated 
for 
a 
long 
time 
on 
the 
same 
subject 
and 
upon 
most 
of 
the 
matters 
which 
are 
therein 
touched 
upon, 
I 
have 
thought 
that 
it 
would 
be 
a 
good 
opportunity 
to 
put 
forth 
something 
under 
the 
title 
of 
New 
Essays 
on 
the 
Understanding, 
and 
to 
obtain 
a 
favorablereceptionformy 
thoughtsby 
puttingtheminsuchgoodcompany. 
I 
have 
thought 
also 
that 
I 
should 
be 
able 
to 
profit 
by 
the 
work 
of 
another, 
not 
only 
to 
lessen 
my 
own 
(since 
in 
fact 
it 
is 
less 
difficult 
to 
follow 
the 
thread 
of 
a 
good 
author 
than 
to 
labor 
entirely 
de 
novo), 
but 
also 
to 
add 
something 
to 
what 
he 
has 
given 
us, 
which 
is 
always 
easier 
than 
to 
begin; 
for 
I 
think 
I 
have 
cleared 
up 
some 
difficulties 
which 
he 
had 
left 
in 
their 
entirety. 
Thus 
his 
reputation 
is 
advantageous 
to 
me; 
besides 
being 
inclined 
to 
do 
justice, 
and 
far 
from 
wishing 
to 
lessen 
the 
esteem 
in 
which 
that 
work 
is 
held, 
I 
would 
increase 
it,if 
myapprovalwasof 
any 
weight. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
I 
oftendifferfrom 
him, 
but 
far 
from 
denying 
the 
merit 
of 
celebrated 
writers, 
we 
bear 
witness 
to 
it, 
by 
making 
known 
in 
what 
and 
why 
we 
separate 
ourselves 
from 
their 
opinion, 
when 
we 
think 
it 
necessary 
to 
prevent 
their 
authority 
from 
prevailing 
over 
reason 
on 
certain 
points 
of 
importance; 
besides 
by 
satisfying 
such 
excellent 
men, 
we 
make 
truth 
more 
acceptable, 
and 
it 
must 
be 
supposed 
that 
it 
isprincipally 
for 
truth 
thatthey 
labor. 


In 
fact, 
although 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Essay 
says 
a 
thousand 
fine 
things 
of 
which 
I 
approve, 
our 
systems 
differ 
very 
much. 
His 
has 
more 
relation 
to 
Aristotle, 
and 
mine 
to 
Plato, 
although 
we 
both 
diverge 
in 
many 
things 
from 



the 
doctrines 
of 
these 
two 
ancients. 
He 
is 
more 
popular, 
and 
I 
am 
forced 
at 
times 
to 
be 
a 
little 
more 
acromatic 
and 
more 
abstract, 
which 
is 
not 
an 
advantage 
to 
me, 
especially 
when 
I 
write 
in 
a 
living 
language. 
I 
think 
nevertheless 
that 
by 
making 
two 
persons 
speak, 
one 
of 
whom 
expounds 
the 
views 
taken 
from 
the 
Essay 
of 
the 
author 
and 
the 
other 
joins 
thereto 
my 
observations, 
the 
parallel 
will 
be 
more 
to 
the 
liking 
of 
the 
reader 
than 
wholly 
dry 
remarks 
the 
reading 
of 
which 
would 
be 
constantly 
interrupted 
by 
the 
necessity 
of 
referring 
to 
his 
hook 
to 
understand 
mine. 
It 
will 
nevertheless 
he 
well 
to 
compare 
now 
and 
then 
our 
writings 
and 
not 
to 
judge 
of 
his 
views 
except 
by 
his 
own 
work, 
although 
I 
have 
ordinarily 
preserved 
its 
expression. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
subjection 
which 
the 
discourse 
of 
another, 
the 
thread 
of 
which 
must 
be 
followed, 
gives 
in 
making 
Remarks, 
has 
prevented 
me 
from 
thinking 
to 
secure 
the 
embellishments 
of 
which 
the 
dialogue 
is 
susceptible: 
butIhopethat 
thematter 
willmakeupforthedefect 
ofstyle. 


Our 
differences 
are 
on 
subjects 
of 
some 
importance. 
The 
question 
is 
to 
know 
whether 
the 
soul 
in 
itself 
is 
entirely 
void 
like 
the 
tablet 
on 
which 
nothing 
has 
yet 
been 
written 
(tabula 
rasa) 
according 
to 
Aristotle 
and 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Essay, 
and 
whether 
all 
that 
is 
traced 
thereon 
conies 
solely 
from 
the 
senses 
and 
from 
experience, 
or 
whether 
the 
soul 
contains 
originally 
the 
principles 
of 
several 
notions 
and 
doctrines 
which 
external 
objects 
merely 
awaken 
on 
occasions, 
as 
I 
believe 
with 
Plato 
and 
even 
with 
the 
schoolmen 
and 
with 
all 
those 
who 
take 
with 
this 
meaning 
the 
passage 
of 
St. 
Paul 
(Romans, 
2, 
15) 
where 
he 
remarks 
that 
the 
law 
of 
God 
is 
written 
in 
the 
heart. 
The 
Stoics 
called 
these 
principles 
prolepses, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
fundamental 
assumptions, 
or 
what 
is 
taken 
for 
granted 
in 
advance. 
The 
mathematicians 
call 
them 
common 
notions. 
Modern 
philosophers 
give 
them 
other 
beautiful 
names, 
and 
Julius 
Scaliger 
in 
particular 
named 
them 
semina 
aeternitatis, 
also 
zopyra, 
as 
meaning 
living 
fires, 
luminous 
rays, 
concealed 
within 
us, 
but 



which 
the 
encounter 
of 
the 
senses 
makes 
appear 
like 
the 
sparks 
which 
the 
blow 
makes 
spring 
from 
the 
steel. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
without 
reason 
that 
these 
glitterings 
are 
believed 
to 
indicate 
something 
divine 
and 
eternal 
which 
appears 
especially 
in 
necessary 
truths. 
Whence 
there 
arises 
another 
question, 
whether 
all 
truths 
depend 
on 
experience, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
on 
induction 
and 
examples, 
or 
whether 
there 
are 
some 
which 
have 
still 
another 
basis. 
For 
if 
some 
events 
can 
be 
foreseen 
before 
any 
proof 
which 
may 
have 
been 
made 
of 
them, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
we 
contribute 
something 
on 
our 
part 
thereto. 
The 
senses 
although 
necessary 
for 
all 
our 
actual 
knowledge 
are 
not 
sufficient 
to 
give 
it 
all 
to 
us, 
since 
the 
senses 
never 
give 
anything 
except 
examples, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
particular 
or 
individual 
truths. 
Now 
all 
the 
examples 
of 
whatever 
number 
they 
he, 
which 
confirm 
a 
general 
truth, 
do 
not 
suffice 
to 
establish 
the 
universal 
necessity 
of 
this 
same 
truth, 
for 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
what 
has 
happened 
will 
happen 
just 
so. 
For 
example, 
the 
Greeks 
and 
Romans 
and 
all 
other 
peoples 
of 
the 
earth 
known 
to 
the 
ancients, 
have 
always 
noticed 
that 
before 
the 
expiration 
of 
twenty-four 
hours 
day 
changes 
into 
night 
and 
the 
night 
into 
day. 
But 
we 
would 
be 
deceived 
if 
we, 
believed 
that 
the 
same 
law 
holds 
good 
everywhere 
else, 
for 
since 
then 
the 
contrary 
has 
been 
experienced 
in 
the 
region 
of 
Nova 
Zembla. 
And 
he 
would 
still 
deceive 
himself 
who 
believed 
that 
in 
our 
climates 
at 
least 
it 
is 
a 
necessary 
and 
eternal 
truth 
which 
will 
last 
always, 
since 
we 
must 
think 
that 
the 
earth 
and 
the 
sun 
themselves 
do 
not 
exist 
necessarily, 
and 
that 
there 
will 
perhaps 
be 
a 
time 
when 
that 
beautiful 
star 
will 
no 
longer 
be, 
at 
least 
in 
its 
present 
form, 
nor 
all 
its 
system. 
Whence 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
necessary 
truths 
such 
as 
are 
found 
in 
the 
pure 
mathematics 
and 
especially 
in 
arithmetic 
and 
in 
geometry, 
ought 
to 
have 
principles 
the 
proof 
of 
which 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
examples, 
nor, 
consequently, 
on 
the 
testimony 
of 
the 
senses, 
although 
without 
the 
senses 
we 
would 
never 
take 
it 
into 
our 
heads 
to 
think 
of 
them. 
This 
ought 
to 
be 
well 
recognized, 
and 
this 
is 



what 
Euclid 
has 
so 
well 
understood 
that 
he 
often 
demonstrates 
by 
the 
reason 
that 
which 
is 
sufficiently 
seen 
through 
experience 
and 
by 
sensible 
images. 
Logic 
also, 
together 
with 
metaphysics 
and 
ethics, 
one 
of 
which 
forms 
theology 
and 
the 
other 
jurisprudence, 
both 
natural, 
are 
full 
of 
such 
truths, 
and 
consequently 
their 
proof 
can 
only 
come 
from 
internal 
principles 
which 
are 
called 
innate. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
must 
not 
imagine 
that 
these 
eternal 
laws 
of 
the 
reason 
can 
be 
read 
in 
the 
soul 
as 
in 
an 
open 
book, 
as 
the 
edict 
of 
the 
pretor 
is 
read 
upon 
his 
album 
without 
difficulty 
and 
without 
search; 
but 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
they 
can 
be 
discovered 
in 
us 
by 
force 
of 
attention, 
for 
which 
occasions 
are 
furnished 
by 
the 
senses, 
and 
the 
success 
of 
experiences 
serves 
also 
as 
confirmation 
to 
the 
reason, 
very 
much 
as 
proofs 
serve 
in 
arithmetic 
for 
better 
avoiding 
error 
of 
reckoning 
when 
the 
reasoning 
is 
long. 
It 
is 
also 
in 
this 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
men 
and 
that 
of 
the 
brutes 
differ: 
the 
brutes 
are 
purely 
empirics 
and 
only 
guide 
themselves 
by 
examples, 
for 
they 
never, 
as 
far 
as 
we 
can 
judge, 
come 
to 
form 
necessary 
propositions; 
whereas 
men 
are 
capable 
of 
demonstrative 
sciences. 
It 
is 
also 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
the 
faculty 
which 
brutes 
have 
of 
making 
consecutions 
is 
something 
inferior 
to 
the 
reason 
which 
is 
in 
man. 
The 
consecutions 
of 
the 
brutes 
are 
merely 
like 
those 
of 
simple 
empirics, 
who 
claim 
that 
what 
has 
happened 
sometimes 
will 
happen 
also 
in 
a 
case 
where 
that 
which 
strikes 
them 
is 
similar, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
judge 
whether 
the 
same 
reasons 
hold 
good. 
This 
is 
why 
it 
is 
so 
easy 
for 
men 
to 
entrap 
brutes 
and 
so 
easy 
for 
simple 
empirics 
to 
make 
mistakes. 
This 
is 
why 
persons 
who 
have 
become 
skilled 
by 
age 
or 
by 
experience 
are 
not 
exempt 
from 
error 
when 
they 
rely 
too 
much 
upon 
their 
past 
experience, 
as 
has 
happened 
to 
many 
in 
civil 
and 
military 
affairs; 
because 
they 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
consider 
that 
the 
world 
changes 
and 
that 
men 
become 
more 
skilled 
by 
finding 
a 
thousand 
new 
dexterities, 
whereas 
deers 
and 
hares 
of 
the 
present 
day 
do 
not 
become 
more 
cunning 
than 
those 
of 
past 
time. 
The 
consecutions 
of 
the 
brutes 
are 
only 
a 



shadow 
of 
reasoning, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
they 
are 
but 
connections 
of 
the 
imagination 
and 
passages 
from 
one 
image 
to 
another, 
because 
in 
a 
new 
juncture 
which 
appears 
similar 
to 
the 
preceding 
they 
expect 
anew 
what 
they 
found 
conjoined 
with 
it 
before, 
as 
if 
things 
were 
linked 
together 
in 
fact 
because 
their 
images 
are 
in 
the 
memory. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
even 
reason 
counsels 
us 
to 
expect 
ordinarily 
to 
see 
that 
happen 
in 
the 
future 
which 
is 
conformed 
to 
a 
longpast 
experience,butthisisnotforthisreasonanecessaryandinfallible 
truth, 
and 
success 
may 
cease 
when 
we 
expect 
it 
least, 
if 
the 
reasons 
which 
have 
sustained 
it 
change. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
wisest 
do 
not 
rely 
upon 
it 
so 
much 
that 
they 
do 
not 
try 
to 
discover 
something 
of 
the 
reason 
(if 
it 
is 
possible) 
of 
this 
fact, 
in 
order 
to 
judge 
when 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
make 
exceptions. 
For 
reason 
is 
alone 
capable 
of 
establishing 
sure 
rules, 
and 
of 
supplying 
what 
is 
lacking 
to 
those 
which 
were 
not 
sure 
by 
inserting 
their 
exceptions; 
and 
of 
finding, 
finally, 
certain 
connections 
in 
the 
force 
of 
necessary 
consequences, 
which 
often 
gives 
the 
means 
of 
foreseeing 
the 
event 
without 
having 
need 
of 
experiencing 
the 
sensible 
connections 
of 
images, 
to 
which 
the 
brutes 
are 
reduced; 
so 
that 
that 
whichjustifies 
the 
internalprinciples 
of 
necessarytruths, 
distinguishesalsoman 
fromthe 
brutes. 


Perhaps 
our 
able 
author 
will 
not 
differ 
entirely 
from 
my 
opinion. 
Tor 
after 
having 
employed 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
first 
book 
in 
rejecting 
innate 
lights, 
taken 
in 
a 
certain 
sense, 
he 
nevertheless 
avows 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
second 
and 
in 
what 
follows, 
that 
the 
ideas 
which 
do 
not 
originate 
in 
sensation 
come 
from 
reflection. 
Now 
reflection 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
attention 
to 
what 
is 
in 
us, 
and 
the 
senses 
do 
not 
give 
us 
that 
which 
we 
already 
carry 
with 
us. 
This 
being 
so, 
can 
it 
be 
denied 
that 
there 
is 
much 
that 
is 
innate 
in 
our 
mind, 
since 
we 
are 
innate, 
so 
to 
say, 
in 
ourselves? 
and 
that 
there 
is 
in 
us 
ourselves, 
being, 
unity, 
substance, 
duration, 
change, 
action, 
perception, 
pleasure, 
and 
a 
thousand 
other 
objects 
of 
our 
intellectual 
ideas? 
And 
these 
objects 
being 
immediate 
to 



our 
understanding 
and 
always 
present 
(although 
they 
cannot 
be 
always 
perceived 
on 
account 
of 
our 
distractions 
and 
wants), 
why 
be 
astonished 
that 
we 
say 
that 
these 
ideas, 
with 
all 
which 
depends 
on 
them, 
are 
innate 
in 
us? 
I 
have 
made 
use 
also 
of 
the 
comparison 
of 
a 
block 
of 
marble 
which 
has 
veins, 
rather 
than 
of 
a 
block 
of 
marble 
wholly 
even, 
or 
of 
blank 
tablets, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
what 
is 
called 
among 
philosophers 
tabula 
rasa. 
For 
if 
the 
soul 
resembled 
these 
blank 
tablets, 
truths 
would 
be 
in 
us 
as 
the 
figure 
of 
Hercules 
is 
in 
marble 
when 
the 
marble 
is 
entirely 
indifferent 
toward 
receiving 
this 
figure 
or 
some 
other. 
But 
if 
there 
were 
veins 
in 
the 
block, 
which 
should 
mark 
out 
the 
figure 
of 
Hercules 
rather 
than 
other 
figures, 
the 
block 
would 
be 
more 
determined 
thereto, 
and 
Hercules 
would 
be 
in 
it 
as 
in 
some 
sort 
innate, 
although 
it 
would 
be 
necessaryto 
labor 
inorder 
to 
discover 
these 
veins 
and 
to 
cleanse 
them 
by 
polishing 
and 
by 
cutting 
away 
that 
which 
prevents 
them 
fromappearing. 
Itisthusthatideasandtruthsareinnatein 
us,as 
inclinations, 
dispositions, 
habits, 
or 
natural 
capacities, 
and 
not 
as 
actions; 
although 
these 
capacities 
are 
always 
accompanied 
by 
some 
actions, 
often 
insensible, 
which 
correspond 
tothem. 


It 
seems 
that 
our 
able 
author 
claims 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
virtual 
in 
us 
and 
nothing 
even 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
always 
actually 
conscious, 
but 
he 
cannot 
take 
this 
strictly, 
otherwise 
his 
opinion 
would 
be 
too 
paradoxical; 
since, 
moreover, 
acquired 
habits 
and 
the 
stores 
of 
our 
memory 
are 
not 
always 
consciously 
perceived 
and 
do 
not 
even 
come 
always 
to 
our 
aid 
at 
need, 
although 
we 
ofteneasilybringthembacktothe 
mindonsomeslightoccasion 
which 
makes 
us 
remember 
them, 
just 
as 
we 
need 
but 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
song 
to 
remember 
it. 
He 
modifies 
also 
his 
assertion 
in 
other 
places, 
by 
saying 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
us 
of 
which 
we 
have 
not 
been 
at 
least 
formerly 
conscious. 
Butin 
addition 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
noonecanhe 
sure 
byreasonalonehowfar 
our 
past 
apperceptions 
which 
we 
may 
have 
forgotten 
may 
have 
gone, 
especially 



according 
to 
the 
reminiscence 
of 
the 
Platonists, 
which, 
fabulous 
as 
it 
is, 
has 
nothing 
in 
it 
incompatible 
at 
least 
in 
part 
with 
the 
bare 
reason; 
in 
addition 
to 
this, 
I 
say, 
why 
is 
it 
necessary 
that 
all 
he 
acquired 
by 
us 
through 
the 
perceptions 
of 
external 
things, 
and 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
unearthed 
in 
ourselves? 
Is 
our 
soul 
then 
such 
a 
blank 
that, 
besides 
the 
images 
imprinted 
from 
without, 
it 
is 
nothing? 
This 
is 
not 
an 
opinion 
(I 
am 
sure) 
which 
our 
judicious 
author 
can 
approve. 
And 
where 
are 
there 
found 
tablets 
which 
are 
not 
something 
varied 
in 
themselves? 
For 
we 
never 
see 
a 
plain 
perfectly 
even 
and 
uniform. 
Why 
then 
could 
we 
not 
furnish 
also 
to 
ourselves 
something 
of 
thought 
from 
our 
own 
depths, 
if 
we 
should 
dig 
therein? 
Thus 
I 
am 
led 
to 
believe 
that 
at 
bottom 
his 
opinion 
on 
this 
point 
is 
not 
different 
from 
mine 
or 
rather 
from 
the 
common 
opinion, 
inasmuch, 
as 
he 
recognized 
two 
sources 
of 
ourknowledge, 
the 
Sensesand 
Reflection. 


Idonotknowwhether 
itwillbeaseasy 
tobringhiminaccordwith 
usand 
with 
the 
Cartesians, 
when 
he 
maintains 
that 
the 
mind 
does 
not 
always 
think 
and 
particularly 
that 
it 
is 
without 
perception 
when 
we 
sleep 
without 
dreaming. 
And 
he 
objects 
that, 
since 
bodies 
may 
he 
without 
movement, 
souls 
may 
also 
well 
be 
without 
thought. 
But 
here 
I 
reply 
a 
little 
differently 
than 
is 
wont 
to 
be 
done, 
for 
I 
maintain 
that 
naturally 
a 
substance 
cannot 
be 
without 
action, 
and 
even 
that 
there 
is 
never 
a 
body 
without 
movement. 
Experience 
already 
favors 
me, 
and 
one 
has 
only 
to 
consult 
the 
hook 
of 
the 
illustrious 
Mr. 
Boyle 
against 
absolute 
repose, 
to 
be 
persuaded 
of 
it; 
but 
I 
believe 
that 
reason 
also 
favorsit 
anditis 
oneof 
theproofswhich 
I 
have 
for 
destroyingatoms. 


Furthermore 
there 
are 
a 
thousand 
indications 
which 
lead 
us 
to 
think 
that 
there 
are 
constantly 
numberless 
perceptions 
in 
us, 
but 
without 
apperception 
and 
without 
reflection; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
changes 
in 
the 
soul 
itself 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
because 
the 
impressions 
are 
either 
too 
slight 
or 
in 
too 
great 
a 
number 
or 
too 
even, 
so 
that 
they 
have 
nothing 
sufficient 
to 
distinguish 
them 



one 
from 
the 
other, 
but 
joined 
to 
others, 
they 
do 
not 
fail 
to 
produce 
their 
effect 
and 
to 
make 
themselves 
felt 
at 
least 
confusedly 
in 
the 
mass. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
custom 
causes 
us 
not 
to 
take 
notice 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
mill 
or 
of 
a 
waterfall 
when 
we 
have 
lived 
near 
it 
for 
some 
time. 
It 
is 
not 
that 
the 
motion 
does 
not 
always 
strike 
our 
organs, 
and 
that 
something 
does 
not 
enter 
the 
soul 
which 
answers 
thereto, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body; 
but 
these 
impressions 
which 
are 
in 
the 
soul 
and 
in 
body, 
being 
destitute 
of 
the 
charms 
of 
novelty, 
are 
not 
strong 
enough 
to 
attract 
our 
attention 
and 
our 
memory, 
attached 
as 
they 
are 
to 
objects 
more 
engrossing. 
For 
all 
attention 
requires 
memory, 
and 
often 
when 
we 
are 
not 
admonished, 
so 
to 
speak, 
and 
advised 
to 
attend 
to 
some 
of 
our 
own 
present 
perceptions, 
we 
let 
them 
pass 
without 
reflection 
and 
even 
without 
being 
noticed; 
but 
if 
some 
one 
calls 
our 
attention 
to 
them 
immediately 
afterwards 
and 
makes 
us 
notice, 
for 
example, 
some 
noise 
which 
was 
just 
heard, 
we 
remember 
it 
and 
are 
conscious 
of 
having 
had 
at 
the 
time 
some 
feeling 
of 
it. 
Thus 
it 
was 
with 
the 
perceptions 
of 
which 
we 
were 
not 
immediately 
conscious, 
the 
consciousness 
only 
coming 
in 
this 
case 
from 
the 
warning 
after 
some 
interval 
small 
though 
it 
may 
be. 
And 
to 
judge 
still 
better 
of 
the 
minute 
perceptions 
which 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
distinguish 
in 
the 
crowd, 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
example 
of 
the 
roar 
or 
noise 
of 
the 
sea 
which 
strikes 
one 
when 
on 
the 
shore. 
To 
understand 
this 
noise 
as 
it 
is 
made 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
hear 
the 
parts 
which 
compose 
the 
whole, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
noise 
of 
each 
wave, 
although 
each 
of 
these 
little 
noises 
only 
makes 
itself 
known 
in 
the 
confused 
collection 
of 
all 
the 
others 
together, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
roar 
itself, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
noticed 
if 
the 
wave 
which 
makes 
it 
was 
alone. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
that 
we 
are 
affected 
a 
little 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
this 
wave 
and 
that 
we 
have 
some 
perception 
of 
each 
of 
these 
noises 
however 
small; 
otherwise 
we 
would 
not 
have 
that 
of 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
waves, 
since 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
nothings 
cannot 
make 
something. 
One 



never 
sleeps 
so 
profoundly 
but 
that 
he 
has 
some 
feeble 
and 
confused 
feeling, 
and 
he 
would 
never 
be 
awakened 
by 
the 
greatest 
noise 
in 
the 
world 
if 
he 
did 
not 
have 
some 
perception 
of 
its 
small 
beginning, 
just 
as 
one 
would 
never 
break 
a 
rope 
by 
the 
greatest 
effort 
in 
the 
world 
if 
it 
was 
not 
stretched 
and 
lengthened 
a 
little 
by 
smaller 
efforts, 
although 
the 
little 
extension 
which 
they 
producedoesnotappear. 


These 
minute 
perceptions 
are 
then 
of 
greater 
efficacy 
by 
their 
consequences 
than 
is 
thought. 
It 
is 
they 
which 
form 
I 
know 
not 
what, 
these 
tastes,these 
images 
ofthe 
sensible 
qualities,clear 
in 
the 
mass 
but 
confused 
in 
the 
parts, 
these 
impressions 
which 
surrounding 
bodies 
make 
upon 
us, 
which 
embrace 
the 
infinite, 
this 
connection 
which 
each 
being 
has 
with 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
universe. 
It 
may 
even 
be 
said 
that 
in 
consequence 
of 
these 
minute 
perceptions 
the 
present 
is 
big 
with 
the 
future 
and 
loaded 
with 
the 
past, 
that 
all 
things 
conspire; 
and 
that 
in 
the 
least 
of 
substances 
eyesaspiercingas 
those 
of 
God 
could 
read 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
the 
things 
in 
the 
universe. 
Quae 
sint, 
quae 
fuerint, 
quae 
mox 
futura 
trahantur. 
These 
insensible 
perceptions 
indicate 
also 
and 
constitute 
the 
same 
individual, 
who 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
traces 
or 
expressions 
which 
they 
preserve 
of 
the 
preceding 
states 
of 
this 
individual, 
in 
making 
the 
connection 
with 
his 
present 
state; 
and 
these 
can 
be 
known 
by 
a 
superior 
mind, 
even 
if 
this 
individual 
himself 
should 
not 
be 
aware 
of 
them, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
the 
express 
recollection 
of 
them 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
in 
him. 
But 
they 
(these 
perceptions, 
I 
say) 
furnish 
the 
means 
of 
finding 
again 
this 
recollection 
at 
need 
by 
the 
periodic 
developments 
which 
may 
happen 
some 
day. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
death 
can 
be 
but 
a 
sleep, 
and 
cannot 
indeed 
continue, 
the 
perceptions 
merely 
ceasing 
to 
be 
sufficiently 
distinguished 
and 
being, 
in 
animals, 
reduced 
to 
a 
state 
of 
confusion 
which 
suspends 
consciousness, 
but 
whichcouldnotlast 
always; 
nottospeak 
hereofman 
who 
musthaveinthis 
respect

privilegesinordertopreservehispersonality. 



It 
is 
also 
through 
the 
insensible 
perceptions 
that 
the 
admirable 
preestablished 
harmony 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
and 
indeed 
of 
all 
monads 
or 
simple 
substances, 
is 
to 
be 
explained; 
which 
supplies 
the 
place 
of 
the 
unmaintainable 
influence 
of 
the 
one 
upon 
the 
others, 
and 
which 
in 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
author 
of 
the 
finest 
of 
Dictionaries 
exalts 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
divine 
perfections 
above 
what 
has 
ever 
been 
conceived. 
After 
this 
I 
would 
add 
little 
if 
I 
should 
say 
that 
it 
is 
these 
minute 
perceptions 
which 
determine 
us 
in 
many 
a 
juncture 
without 
it 
being 
thought 
of, 
and 
which 
deceive 
the 
vulgar 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
an 
indifference 
of 
equilibrium, 
as 
if 
we 
were 
entirely 
indifferent 
to 
turning 
(for 
example) 
to 
the 
right, 
or 
to 
the 
left. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
also 
that 
I 
notice 
here, 
as 
I 
have 
done 
in 
the 
book 
itself, 
that 
they 
cause 
that 
uneasiness 
which 
I 
show 
consists 
in 
something 
which 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
pain 
except 
as 
the 
small 
from 
the 
great, 
and 
which 
nevertheless 
often 
constitutes 
our 
desire 
and 
even 
our 
pleasure, 
in 
giving 
to 
it 
a 
salt 
which 
stimulates. 
It 
is 
also 
the 
inconceivable 
parts 
of 
our 
sensible 
perceptions 
which 
produce 
a 
relation 
between 
the 
perceptions 
of 
colors, 
of 
heat 
and 
of 
other 
sensible 
qualities 
and 
between 
the 
motions 
in 
bodies 
which 
correspond 
to 
them, 
whereas 
theCartesians 
with 
our 
author, 
thoroughly 
penetratingashe 
is, 
conceive 
the 
perceptions, 
which 
we 
have 
of 
these 
qualities 
as 
arbitrary, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
as 
if 
God 
had 
given 
them 
to 
the 
soul 
according 
to 
his 
good 
pleasure 
without 
having 
regard 
to 
any 
essential 
relation 
between 
these 
perceptions 
and 
their 
objects: 
an 
opinion 
which 
surprises 
me 
and 
which 
appears 
to 
me 
little 
worthy 
of 
the 
Author 
of 
things 
who 
does 
nothing 
without 
harmony 
and 
withoutreason. 


Inaword,these 
insensible 
perceptions 
are 
of 
as 
great 
use 
in 
pneumatics 
as 
the 
insensible 
corpuscles 
are 
in 
physics, 
and 
it 
is 
equally 
as 
unreasonable 
to 
reject 
the 
one 
as 
the 
other 
under 
the 
pretext 
that 
they 
are 
beyond 
the 
reach 
of 
our 
senses. 
Nothing 
is 
done 
all 
at 
once, 
and 
it 
is 
one 
of 
my 
great 
maxims, 
and 



one 
of 
the 
most 
verified, 
that 
nature 
never 
makes 
leaps: 
this 
is 
what 
I 
called 
the 
Lam 
of 
continuity, 
when 
I 
spoke 
of 
it 
in 
the 
first 
Nouvelles 
de 
la 
République 
des 
Lettres, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
this 
law 
is 
very 
considerable 
in 
physics. 
It 
teaches 
that 
we 
pass 
always 
from 
the 
small 
to 
the 
great, 
and 
vice 
versa, 
through 
the 
medium, 
in 
degrees 
as 
in 
parts, 
and 
that 
motion 
never 
arises 
immediately 
from 
repose 
nor 
is 
reduced 
to 
it 
except 
by 
a 
smaller 
motion, 
just 
as 
one 
never 
completes 
running 
any 
line 
or 
length 
before 
having 
completed 
a 
shorter 
line; 
although 
hitherto 
those 
who 
have 
laid 
down 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
have 
not 
observed 
this 
law, 
believing 
that 
a 
body 
can 
receive 
in 
an 
instant 
a 
motion 
contrary 
to 
the 
preceding. 
And 
all 
this 
leads 
us 
to 
conclude 
rightly 
that 
the 
noticeable 
perceptions 
also 
come 
by 
degrees 
from 
these 
which 
are 
too 
minute 
to 
be 
noticed. 
To 
think 
otherwise 
is 
to 
little 
understand 
the 
immense 
subtilty 
of 
things 
which 
always 
and 
everywhere 
embracesanactualinfinite. 


I 
have 
also 
noticed 
that 
in 
virtue 
of 
insensible 
variations, 
two 
individual 
things 
cannot 
be 
perfectly 
alike, 
and 
that 
they 
must 
always 
differ 
more 
than 
numéro; 
which 
destroys 
the 
blank 
tablets 
of 
the 
soul, 
a 
soul 
without 
thought, 
a 
substance 
without 
action, 
a 
void 
in 
space, 
atoms 
and 
even 
particles 
not 
actually 
divided 
in 
matter, 
absolute 
rest, 
entire 
uniformity 
in 
one 
part 
of 
time, 
of 
space 
or 
of 
matter, 
perfect 
globes 
of 
the 
second 
element, 
born 
of 
perfect 
and 
original 
cubes, 
and 
a 
thousand 
other 
fictions 
of 
the 
philosophers 
which 
come 
from 
their 
incomplete 
notions, 
and 
which 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
does 
not 
permit, 
and 
which 
our 
ignorance 
and 
the 
little 
attention 
we 
give 
to 
the 
insensible, 
let 
pass, 
but 
which 
can 
not 
be 
tolerated, 
unless 
they 
are 
limited 
to 
abstractions 
of 
the 
mind 
which 
protests 
that 
it 
does 
not 
deny 
what 
it 
puts 
aside 
and 
what 
it 
thinks 
ought 
not 
enter 
into 
any 
present 
consideration. 
Otherwise 
if 
it 
is 
rightly 
understood, 
namely, 
that 
‘things 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious, 
are 
not 
in 
the 
soul 
nor 
in 
the 
body, 
we 
should 
be 
lacking 
in 



philosophy 
as 
in 
politics, 
in 
neglecting 
το 
μιχρον, 
insensible 
progress; 
whereas 
an 
abstraction 
is 
not 
an 
error, 
provided 
that 
we 
know 
what 
it 
is 
that 
we 
feign 
in 
it. 
Just 
as 
mathematicians 
employ 
it 
when 
they 
speak 
of 
perfect 
lines 
which 
they 
propose 
to 
us, 
of 
uniform 
motions 
and 
of 
other 
regulated 
effects, 
although 
matter 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
medley 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
surrounding 
infinite) 
makes 
always 
some 
exception. 
It 
is 
in 
order 
to 
distinguish 
the 
considerations 
and 
to 
reduce, 
as 
far 
as 
is 
possible, 
the 
effects 
to 
reasons 
and 
to 
foresee 
some 
of 
their 
consequences, 
that 
we 
proceed 
thus: 
for 
the 
more 
attentive 
we 
are 
to 
neglect 
no 
consideration 
which 
we 
are 
able 
to 
regulate, 
the 
more 
practice 
corresponds 
to 
theory. 
But 
it 
pertains 
only 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Reason, 
which 
nothing 
escapes, 
to 
comprehend 
distinctly 
all 
the 
infinite 
and 
to 
see 
all 
the 
reasons 
and 
all 
the 
consequences. 
All 
that 
we 
can 
do 
as 
regards 
infinites 
is 
to 
know 
them 
confusedly 
and 
to 
know 
at 
least 
distinctly 
that 
they 
are 
thus; 
otherwise 
we 
judge 
very 
wrongly 
of 
the 
beauty 
and 
grandeur 
of 
the 
universe; 
so 
also 
we 
could 
not 
have 
a 
sound 
physics 
which 
should 
explain 
the 
nature 
of 
bodies 
in 
general, 
and 
still 
less 
a 
sound 
pneumatics 
which 
should 
comprise 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God, 
of 
souls 
and 
of 
simplesubstancesingeneral. 


This 
knowledge 
of 
insensible 
perceptions 
serves 
also 
to 
explain 
why 
and 
how 
two 
souls, 
human 
or 
otherwise, 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
never 
come 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Creator 
perfectly 
alike, 
and 
each 
always 
has 
its 
original 
relation 
to 
the 
points 
of 
view 
which 
it 
will 
have 
in 
the 
universe. 
But 
this 
it 
is 
which 
already 
follows 
from 
what 
I 
have 
remarked 
of 
two 
individuals, 
namely, 
that 
their 
difference 
is 
always 
more 
than 
numerical. 
There 
is 
still 
another 
point 
of 
importance, 
on 
which 
I 
am 
obliged 
to 
differ 
not 
only 
from 
the 
opinions 
of 
our 
author 
but 
also 
from 
those 
of 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
modern 
philosophers; 
this 
is, 
that 
I 
believe 
with 
most 
of 
the 
ancients 
that 
all 
genii, 
all 
souls, 
all 
simple 
created 
substances 
are 
always 
joined 
to 
a 
body 
and 
that 
there 
never 
are 
souls 



entirely 
separated. 
I 
have 
à 
priori 
reasons 
for 
this; 
but 
this 
advantage 
is 
also 
found 
in 
the 
doctrine, 
that 
it 
resolves 
all 
the 
philosophical 
difficulties 
as 
to 
the 
condition 
of 
souls, 
as 
to 
their 
perpetual 
conservation, 
as 
to 
their 
immortality 
and 
as 
to 
their 
action. 
The 
difference 
of 
one 
of 
their 
states 
from 
another 
never 
being 
and 
never 
having 
been 
anything 
but 
that 
of 
more 
sensible 
to 
less 
sensible, 
of 
more 
perfect 
to 
less 
perfect, 
or 
vice 
versa, 
it 
renders 
their 
past 
or 
future 
state 
as 
explicable 
as 
that 
of 
the 
present. 
One 
feels 
sufficiently, 
however 
little 
reflection 
one 
makes, 
that 
this 
is 
rational, 
and 
that 
a 
leap 
from 
one 
state 
to 
another 
infinitely 
different 
could 
not 
be 
natural. 
I 
am 
astonished 
that 
by 
quitting 
the 
natural 
without 
reason, 
the 
schoolmen 
have 
been 
willing 
to 
plunge 
themselves 
purposely 
into 
very 
great 
difficulties 
and 
to 
furnish 
matter 
for 
apparent 
triumphs 
of 
the 
strong-minded, 
all 
of 
whose 
reasons 
fall 
at 
a 
single 
blow 
by 
this 
explanation 
of 
things, 
where 
there 
is 
no 
more 
difficulty 
in 
conceiving 
the 
conservation 
of 
souls 
(or 
rather 
according 
to 
me 
of 
the 
animal) 
than 
there 
is 
in 
conceiving 
the 
change 
of 
the 
caterpillar 
into 
the 
butterfly, 
and 
the 
conservation 
of 
thought 
in 
sleep, 
to 
which 
Jesus 
Christ 
has 
divinely 
well 
compared 
death. 
Also 
I 
have 
already 
said 
that 
a 
sleep 
could 
not 
last 
always, 
and 
it 
will 
last 
least 
or 
almost 
not 
at 
all 
to 
rational 
souls 
who 
are 
always 
destined 
to 
preserve 
the 
personality 
which 
has 
been 
given 
them 
in 
the 
City 
of 
God, 
and 
consequently 
remembrance: 
and 
this 
in 
order 
to 
be 
more 
susceptible 
to 
chastisements 
and 
recompenses. 
And 
I 
add 
also 
that 
in 
general 
no 
derangement 
of 
the 
visible 
organs 
is 
able 
to 
throw 
things 
into 
entire 
confusion 
in 
the 
animal 
or 
to 
destroy 
all 
the 
organs 
and 
to 
deprive 
the 
soul 
of 
all 
its 
organic 
body 
and 
the 
ineffaceable 
remains 
of 
all 
preceding 
traces. 
But 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
the 
ancient 
doctrine 
has 
been 
abandoned 
of 
subtile 
bodies 
united 
to 
theangels(which 
wasconfounded 
with 
thecorporality 
of 
the 
angels 
themselves), 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
pretended 
separate 
intelligences 
in 
creatures 
(to 
which 
those 
who 
make 
the 
heavens 
of 
Aristotle 
revolve 
have 



contributed 
much), 
and 
finally 
the 
poorly 
understood 
opinion 
into 
which 
we 
have 
fallen 
that 
the 
souls 
of 
brutes 
could 
not 
be 
preserved 
without 
falling 
into 
metempsychosis 
and 
without 
conducting 
them 
from 
body 
to 
body, 
and 
the 
embarrassment 
in 
which 
men 
have 
been 
placed 
by 
not 
knowing 
what 
to 
do 
with 
them, 
have 
caused 
us, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
to 
neglect 
the 
natural 
way 
of 
explaining 
the 
conservation 
of 
the 
soul. 
This 
has 
done 
great 
injury 
to 
natural 
religion 
and 
has 
made 
many 
believe 
that 
our 
immortality 
was 
only 
a 
miraculous 
grace 
of 
God, 
of 
which 
also 
our 
celebrated 
author 
speaks 
with 
some 
doubt, 
as 
I 
shall 
presently 
remark. 
But 
it 
were 
desirable 
that 
all 
who 
are 
of 
this 
opinion 
had 
spoken 
as 
wisely 
and 
with 
as 
good 
faith 
as 
he, 
for 
it 
is 
to 
be 
feared 
that 
many 
who 
speak 
of 
immortality 
through 
grace 
do 
it 
but 
to 
save 
appearances, 
and 
approximate 
at 
heart 
those 
Averroists 
and 
some 
bad 
Quietists 
who 
picture 
to 
themselves 
an 
absorption 
and 
the 
reunion 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
ocean 
of 
divinity; 
a 
notion 
the 
impossibility 
of 
which 
perhaps 
my 
systemalonemakes 
evident. 


It 
seems 
also 
that 
we 
differ 
further 
as 
regards 
matter, 
in 
that 
the 
author 
thinks 
a 
vacuum 
is 
here 
necessary 
for 
motion 
because 
he 
thinks 
that 
the 
minute 
parts 
of 
matter 
are 
rigid. 
And 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
if 
matter 
were 
composed 
of 
such 
parts 
motion 
in 
a 
plenum 
would 
be 
impossible, 
just 
as 
if 
a 
room 
were 
full 
of 
a 
quantity 
of 
small 
pebbles 
without 
there 
being 
the 
least 
vacant 
space. 
But 
this 
supposition, 
for 
which 
there 
appears 
also 
no 
reason, 
is 
not 
admissible, 
although 
this 
able 
author 
goes 
to 
the 
point 
of 
believing 
that 
rigidity 
or 
cohesion 
of 
minute 
parts 
constitutes 
the 
essence 
of 
body. 
It 
is 
necessary 
rather 
to 
conceive 
space 
as 
full 
of 
an 
originally 
fluid 
matter, 
susceptible 
of 
all 
the 
divisions 
and 
even 
actually 
subject 
to 
divisions 
and 
subdivisions 
ad 
infinitum, 
but 
nevertheless 
with 
this 
difference 
that 
it 
is 
divisible 
and 
divided 
unequally 
in 
different 
places 
on 
account 
of 
the 
motions 
which 
already 
more 
or 
less 
concur 
there. 
This 
it 
is 
which 
causes 
it 
to 
have 



everywhere 
a 
degree 
of 
rigidity 
as 
well 
as 
of 
fluidity, 
and 
which 
causes 
no 
body 
to 
be 
hard 
or 
fluid 
to 
the 
highest 
degree, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
no 
atom 
to 
be 
found 
of 
an 
insurmountable 
hardness 
nor 
any 
mass 
entirely 
indifferent 
to 
division. 
The 
order 
also 
of 
nature 
and 
particularly 
the 
law 
of 
continuity 
destroyboth 
equally. 


I 
have 
shown 
also 
that 
cohesion, 
which 
could 
not 
itself 
be 
the 
effect 
of 
impulse 
or 
of 
motion, 
would 
cause 
a 
traction 
taken 
strictly. 
For 
if 
there 
were 
a 
body 
originally 
inflexible, 
for 
example, 
an 
Epicurean 
atom 
which 
should 
have 
a 
part 
projecting 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
hook 
(since 
we 
can 
conceive 
atoms 
of 
all 
sorts 
of 
figure), 
this 
hook 
pushed 
would 
carry 
with 
it 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
atom, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
part 
which 
is 
not 
pushed 
and 
which 
does 
not 
fall 
in 
the 
line 
of 
impulsion. 
Nevertheless 
our 
able 
author 
is 
himself 
opposed 
to 
these 
philosophical 
tractions, 
such 
as 
were 
attributed 
formerly 
to 
the 
abhorrence 
of 
a 
vacuum, 
and 
he 
is 
reduced 
to 
impulse, 
maintaining 
with 
the 
moderns 
that 
one 
part 
of 
matter 
operates 
immediately 
upon 
another 
only 
by 
pushing 
it 
by 
contact. 
In 
which 
I 
think 
they 
are 
right, 
since 
otherwise 
there 
is 
nothing 
intelligibleinthe 
operation. 


It 
is 
however 
necessary 
not 
to 
conceal 
the 
fact 
that 
I 
have 
noticed 
a 
sort 
of 
retraction 
by 
our 
excellent 
author 
on 
this 
subject; 
whose 
modest 
sincerity 
in 
this 
respect 
I 
cannot 
refrain 
from 
praising 
as 
much 
as 
I 
have 
admired 
his 
penetrating 
genius 
on 
other 
occasions. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
reply 
to 
the 
second 
letter 
of 
the 
late 
Bishop 
of 
Worcester, 
printed 
in 
1699, 
p. 
408, 
where 
to 
justify 
the 
opinion 
which 
he 
had 
maintained 
in 
opposition 
to 
that 
learned 
prelate, 
namely, 
that 
matter 
might 
think, 
he 
says 
among 
other 
things: 
I 
admit 
that 
I 
homesaid(book

§11) 
that 
body 
acts 
by 
impulse 
and 
not 
otherwise. 
This 
also 
was 
my 
opinion 
when 
I 
wrote 
it, 
and 
still 
at 
present 
I 
cannot 
conceive 
in 
it 
another 
manner 
of 
acting. 
But 
since 
then 
I 
have 
been 
convinced 
by 
the 
incomparable 
booh 
of 
the 
judicious 
Mr. 



Newton, 
that 
there 
is 
too 
much 
presumption 
in 
wishing 
to 
limit 
the 
power 
of 
God 
by 
our 
limited 
conceptions. 
The 
gravitation 
of 
matter 
towards 
matter, 
by 
ways 
which 
cure 
inconceivable 
to 
me, 
is 
not 
only 
a 
demonstration 
that 
God 
can, 
when 
it 
seems 
good 
to 
him, 
put 
in 
bodies 
powers 
and 
ways 
of 
acting 
which 
transcend 
that 
which 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
our 
idea 
of 
body 
or 
explained 
by 
what 
we 
know 
of 
matter; 
but 
it 
is 
further 
an 
incontestable 
instance 
that 
he 
has 
really 
done 
so. 
I 
shall 
therefore 
take 
care 
that 
in 
the 
next 
edition 
of 
my 
book 
this 
passage 
be 
corrected. 
I 
find 
that 
in 
the 
French 
version 
of 
this 
book 
made 
undoubtedly 
according 
to 
the 
latest 
editions 
it 
has 
been 
put 
thus 
in 
this 
§ 
11: 
It 
is 
evident, 
at 
least 
so 
far 
as 
we 
are 
able 
to 
conceive 
it, 
that 
it 
is 
by 
impulse 
and 
not 
otherwise 
that 
bodies 
act 
on 
each 
other, 
for 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
understand 
that 
body 
can 
act 
upon 
what 
it 
does 
not 
touch, 
which 
is 
as 
much 
as 
to 
imagine 
that 
it 
can 
act 
where 
it 
is 
not. 


I 
cannot 
but 
praise 
that 
modest 
piety 
of 
our 
celebrated 
author, 
which 
recognizes 
that 
God 
may 
do 
above 
what 
we 
are 
able 
to 
comprehend, 
and 
that 
thus 
there 
may 
be 
inconceivable 
mysteries 
in 
the 
articles 
of 
faith; 
but 
I 
should 
not 
like 
to 
be 
obliged 
to 
resort 
to 
miracle 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
nature, 
and 
to 
admit 
powers 
and 
operations 
absolutely 
inexplicable. 
Otherwise 
too 
much 
license 
will 
be 
given 
to 
poor 
philosophers, 
under 
cover 
of 
what 
God 
can 
do, 
and 
by 
admitting 
these 
centripetal 
virtues 
or 
these 
immediate 
attractions 
from 
afar, 
without 
its 
being 
possible 
to 
render 
them 
intelligible, 
I 
see 
nothing 
to 
hinder 
our 
scholastics 
from 
saying 
that 
everything 
is 
done 
simply 
by 
their 
faculties 
and 
from 
maintaining 
their 
intentional 
species 
which 
go 
from 
objects 
to 
us 
and 
find 
means 
of 
entering 
even 
into 
our 
souls. 
If 
this 
is 
so, 
omnia 
jam 
fient, 
fieri 
quae 
posse 
negabam. 
So 
that 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
our 
author, 
quite 
judicious 
as 
he 
is, 
goes 
here 
a 
little 
too 
much 
from 
one 
extremity 
to 
the 
other. 
He 
is 
squeamish 
concerning 
the 
operations 
of 
souls, 
when 
the 
question 
merely 
is 
to 
admit 
that 
which 
is 
not 
sensible, 
and 
now, 



behold, 
he 
gives 
to 
bodies 
that 
which 
is 
not 
even 
intelligible, 
granting 
them 
powers 
and 
actions 
which 
surpass 
all 
that 
in 
my 
opinion 
a 
created 
spirit 
could 
do 
and 
understand, 
for 
he 
grants 
them 
attraction, 
and 
that 
even 
at 
great 
distances, 
without 
limiting 
himself 
to 
any 
sphere 
of 
activity, 
and 
this 
to 
maintain 
an 
opinion 
which 
does 
not 
appear 
less 
inexplicable; 
namely, 
the 
possibilityofthethoughtof 
matterinthenaturalorder. 


The 
question 
which 
he, 
with 
the 
celebrated 
prelate 
who 
attacked 
him, 
agitates, 
is 
whether 
matter 
can 
think; 
and 
as 
this 
is 
an 
important 
point, 
even 
for 
the 
present 
work, 
I 
cannot 
exempt 
myself 
from 
entering 
upon 
it 
a 
little 
and 
from 
taking 
notice 
of 
their 
controversy. 
I 
will 
present 
the 
substance 
of 
it 
on 
this 
subject 
and 
will 
take 
the 
liberty 
of 
saying 
what 
I 
think 
of 
it. 
The 
late 
Bishop 
of 
Worcester, 
apprehending 
(but 
in 
my 
opinion 
without 
good 
reason) 
that 
our 
author’s 
doctrine 
of 
ideas 
was 
liable 
to 
certain 
abuses 
prejudicial 
to 
the 
Christian 
faith, 
undertook 
to 
examine 
some 
passages 
of 
it 
in 
his 
Vindication 
of 
the 
Doctrine 
of 
the 
Trinity; 
and 
having 
done 
justice 
to 
this 
excellent 
writer 
by 
recognizing 
that 
he 
regards 
the 
existence 
of 
spirit 
as 
certain 
as 
that 
of 
body, 
although 
one 
of 
these 
substances 
is 
as 
little 
known 
as 
the 
other, 
he 
asks 
(p. 
241 
seqq.) 
how 
reflection 
can 
assure 
us 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
spirit, 
if 
God 
can 
give 
to 
matter 
the 
faculty 
of 
thinking, 
according 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
our 
author, 
bk. 
4, 
chap. 
3, 
since 
thus 
the 
way 
of 
ideas 
which 
must 
serve 
to 
discern 
that 
which 
is 
suitable 
to 
the 
soul 
or 
the 
body 
would 
become 
useless; 
whereas 
he 
had 
said, 
bk. 
2 
of 
the 
Essay 
on 
the 
Understanding, 
ch. 
23, 
§§ 
15, 
27, 
28, 
that 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
soul 
furnish 
us 
the 
idea 
of 
mind, 
and 
the 
understanding 
with 
the 
will 
renders 
this 
idea 
as 
intelligible 
to 
us 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
is 
rendered 
by 
solidity 
and 
impulse. 
This 
is 
how 
our 
author 
replies 
to 
it 
in 
the 
first 
letter 
(p. 
65 
seqq.): 
I 
believe 
that 
I 
have 
proved 
that 
there 
is 
a 
spiritual 
substance 
in 
us, 
for 
we 
experience 
in 
ourselves 
thought; 
now 
this 
action 
or 
this 
mode 
could 
not 
be 
the 
object 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
thing 



subsisting 
of 
itself, 
and 
consequently 
this 
mode 
needs 
a 
support 
or 
subject 
of 
inhesion, 
and 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
support 
forms 
what 
we 
call 
substance... 
For 
since 
the 
general 
idea 
of 
substance 
is 
everywhere 
the 
same, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
modification, 
which 
is 
called 
thought 
or 
power 
of 
thinking, 
being 
joined 
to 
it, 
there 
results 
a 
mind 
without 
there 
being 
need 
of 
considering 
what 
other 
modification 
it 
has 
in 
addition; 
that 
is 
whether 
it 
has 
solidity 
or 
not. 
And 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
substance 
which 
has 
the 
modification 
called 
solidity 
will 
be 
matter, 
whether 
thought 
be 
joined 
to 
it 
or 
not. 
But 
if 
by 
a 
spiritual 
substance 
you 
understand 
an 
immaterial 
substance, 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
home 
not 
proved 
that 
there 
is 
one 
in 
us, 
and 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
proved 
demonstratively 
on 
my 
principles. 
Although 
what 
I 
have 
said 
on 
the 
systems 
of 
matter 
(bk. 
4, 
ch. 
10, 
§ 
16), 
in 
demonstrating 
that 
God 
is 
immaterial, 
renders 
it 
extremely 
probable 
that 
the 
substance 
which 
thinks 
in 
us 
is 
immaterial 
— 


However 
I 
home 
shown 
(adds 
the 
author, 
p. 
68) 
that 
the 
great 
ends 
of 
religion 
and 
of 
morals 
are 
assured 
by 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul, 
without 
its 
being 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
its 
immateriality. 


The 
learned 
Bishop 
in 
his 
reply 
to 
this 
letter, 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
our 
author 
was 
of 
another 
opinion 
when 
he 
wrote 
his 
second 
hook 
of 
the 
Essay, 
quotes, 
p. 
51, 
the 
passage 
(taken 
from 
the 
same 
book, 
ch. 
23, 
§ 
15) 
where 
it 
is 
said, 
that 
by 
the 
simple 
ideas 
which 
we 
have 
deduced 
from 
the 
operations 
of 
our 
mind, 
we 
can 
form 
the 
complex 
idea 
of 
a 
mind. 
And 
that 
putting 
together 
the 
ideas 
of 
thought, 
of 
perception, 
of 
liberty 
and 
of 
power 
of 
moving 
our 
body, 
we 
have 
as 
clear 
a 
notion 
of 
immaterial 
substances 
as 
of 
material. 
He 
quotes 
still 
other 
passages 
to 
show 
that 
the 
author 
opposed 
mind 
to 
body. 
And 
he 
says 
(p. 
54) 
that 
the 
ends 
of 
religion 
and 
of 
morals 
are 
the 
better 
assured 
by 
proving 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
immortal 
by 
its 
nature, 
that 
is, 
immaterial. 
He 
quotes 
again 
(p. 
70) 
this 
passage, 
that 
all 
the 
ideas 
which 
we 
have 
of 
particular 
and 
distinct 
hinds 
of 
substances 
are 
nothing 
but 
different 



combinations 
of 
simple 
ideas; 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
author 
believed 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
thinking 
and 
of 
willing 
gives 
another 
substance 
different 
from 
that 
which 
the 
idea 
of 
solidity 
and 
of 
impulse 
gives, 
and 
that 
(§ 
17) 
he 
observes 
that 
theseideasconstitutethebodyasopposedto 
mind. 


TheBishopofWorcestermight 
addthatfromthefactthatthe 
general 
idea 
of 
substance 
is 
in 
the 
body 
and 
in 
the 
mind, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
their 
differences 
are 
modifications 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing, 
as 
our 
author 
has 
just 
said 
in 
the 
passage 
which 
I 
have 
adduced 
from 
his 
first 
letter. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
distinguish 
carefully 
between 
modifications 
and 
attributes. 
The 
faculties 
of 
having 
perception 
and 
of 
acting, 
extension, 
solidity, 
are 
attributes 
or 
perpetual 
and 
principal 
predicates; 
but 
thought, 
impetuosity, 
figures, 
movements 
are 
modifications 
of 
these 
attributes. 
Furthermore, 
we 
must 
distinguish 
between 
physical 
(or 
rather 
real) 
genus, 
and 
logical 
or 
ideal 
genus. 
The 
things 
which 
are 
of 
the 
same 
physical 
genus, 
or 
which 
are 
homogeneous, 
are 
of 
the 
same 
matter, 
so 
to 
speak, 
and 
may 
often 
he 
changed 
the 
one 
into 
the 
other 
by 
the 
change 
of 
the 
modification, 
as 
circles 
and 
squares. 
But 
two 
heterogeneous 
things 
may 
have 
a 
common 
logical 
genus, 
and 
then 
their 
differences 
are 
not 
simply 
accidental 
modifications 
of 
the 
same 
subject 
or 
of 
the 
same 
metaphysical 
or 
physical 
matter. 
Thus 
time 
and 
space 
are 
very 
heterogeneous 
things, 
and 
we 
should 
do 
wrong 
to 
imagine 
I 
know 
not 
what 
real 
common 
subject 
which 
had 
but 
the 
contained 
quantity 
in 
generaland 
the 
modificationsofwhichshouldmaketimeorspace 
appear. 


Perhaps 
some 
one 
will 
mock 
at 
these 
distinctions 
of 
philosophers 
of 
two 
genera, 
the 
one 
merely 
logical, 
the 
other 
real; 
and 
of 
two 
matters, 
the 
one 
physical 
which 
is 
that 
of 
bodies, 
the 
other 
only 
metaphysical 
or 
general; 
as 
if 
some 
one 
said 
that 
two 
parts 
of 
space 
are 
of 
the 
same 
matter 
or 
that 
two 
hours 
are 
also 
of 
the 
same 
matter 
among 
themselves. 
Nevertheless 
these 
distinctions 
are 
not 
merely 
of 
terms, 
but 
of 
things 
themselves, 
and 
seem 
to 



come 
in 
here 
very 
appropriately, 
where 
their 
confusion 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
a 
false 
consequence. 
These 
two 
genera 
have 
a 
common 
notion, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
real 
genus 
is 
common 
to 
the 
two 
matters, 
so 
that 
their 
genealogy 
will 
be 
as 
follows: 



I 
have 
not 
seen 
the 
second 
letter 
from 
the 
author 
to 
the 
Bishop, 
but 
the 
reply 
which 
this 
prelate 
makes 
to 
it 
hardly 
touches 
on 
the 
point 
regarding 
the 
thinking 
of 
matter. 
But 
the 
reply 
of 
our 
author 
to 
this 
second 
answer, 
returns 
to 
it. 
God 
(he 
says 
very 
nearly 
in 
these 
words, 
p. 
397), 
adds 
to 
the 
essence 
of 
matter 
the 
qualities 
and 
perfections 
which 
he 
pleases, 
simple 
movement 
in 
some 
pants, 
but 
in 
plants, 
vegetation, 
and 
in 
animals, 
feeling. 
Those 
who 
agree 
up 
to 
this 
point, 
cry 
out 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
more 
step 
is 
taken, 
saying 
that 
God 
can 
give 
to 
matter 
thought, 
reason, 
will, 
as 
if 
this 
destroyed 
the 
essence 
of 
matter. 
But 
to 
prove 
it, 
they 
allege 
that 
thought 
or 
reason 
is 
not 
included 
in 
theessence 
ofmatter, 
a 
pointof 
no 
consequence,since 
movement 
and 
lifeare 
not 
included 
in 
it 
either. 
They 
assert 
also 
that 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
that 
matter 
thinks; 
but 
our 
conception 
is 
not 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
power 
of 
God. 
After 
this 
he 
cites 
the 
example 
of 
the 
attraction 
of 
matter, 
p. 
99, 
but 
especially 
p. 
408, 
where 
he 
speaks 
of 
the 
gravitation 
of 
matter 
toward 
matter 
attributed 
to 
Mr. 
Newton 
(in 
the 
terms 
which 
I 
have 
quoted 
above), 
confessing 
that 
we 
could 
never 
conceive 
the 
manner 
of 
it. 
This 
is 
in 
reality 
to 
return 
to 
the 
occult 
or, 
what 
is 
more, 
inexplicable 
qualities. 
He 
adds, 
p. 
401, 
that 
nothing 
is 
more 
fit 



to 
favor 
the 
sceptics 
than 
to 
deny 
what 
we 
do 
not 
understand; 
and, 
p. 
402, 
that 
we 
do 
not 
conceive 
even 
how 
the 
soul 
thinks. 
He 
will 
have 
it, 
p. 
403, 
that 
the 
two 
substances, 
material 
and 
immaterial, 
capable 
of 
being 
conceived 
in 
their 
bare 
essence 
without 
any 
activity, 
it 
depends 
on 
God 
to 
give 
to 
each 
the 
power 
of 
thinking. 
And 
he 
wishes 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
avowal 
of 
his 
opponent 
who 
had 
granted 
feeling 
to 
brutes, 
but 
who 
would 
not 
grant 
them 
any 
immaterial 
substance. 
It 
is 
claimed 
that 
liberty 
and 
consciousness 
(p. 
408), 
and 
the 
power 
of 
making 
abstractions 
(p. 
409), 
can 
be 
given 
to 
matter, 
not 
as 
matter 
but 
as 
enriched 
by 
a 
divine 
power. 
Finally 
he 
adduces 
the 
remark 
(p. 
434) 
of 
a 
traveller 
as 
important 
and 
as 
judicious 
as 
M. 
de 
la 
Loubere, 
that 
the 
peasants 
of 
the 
east 
know 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul 
withoutbeingableto 
comprehend 
itsimmateriality. 


On 
all 
this 
I 
will 
remark, 
before 
coming 
to 
the 
explanation 
of 
my 
opinion, 
that 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
matter 
is 
as 
little 
capable 
of 
mechanically 
producing 
feeling 
as 
of 
producing 
reason, 
as 
our 
author 
agrees; 
that 
in 
truth 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
it 
is 
not 
right 
to 
deny 
what 
we 
do 
not 
understand, 
but 
I 
add 
that 
we 
are 
right 
in 
denying 
(at 
least 
in 
the 
natural 
order) 
what 
is 
absolutely 
neither 
intelligible 
nor 
explicable. 
I 
maintain 
also 
that 
substances 
(material 
or 
immaterial) 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
in 
their 
bare 
essence 
without 
any 
activity; 
that 
activity 
belongs 
to 
the 
essence 
of 
substance 
in 
general; 
that, 
finally, 
the 
conception 
of 
creatures 
is 
not 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
but 
that 
their 
conceptivity 
or 
force 
of 
conceiving 
is 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
power 
of 
nature; 
everything 
which 
is 
conformed 
to 
the 
natural 
order 
being 
capable 
of 
being 
conceivedorcomprehendedbysomecreature. 


Those 
who 
would 
conceive 
my 
system 
will 
think 
that 
I 
could 
not 
conform 
myself 
in 
everything 
to 
one 
or 
the 
other 
of 
these 
two 
excellent 
authors, 
whose 
controversy, 
however, 
is 
highly 
instructive. 
But 
to 
explain 
myself 
distinctly, 
before 
all 
else 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
consider 
that 
the 
modifications 
which 
may 



belong 
naturally 
or 
without 
miracle 
to 
a 
subject, 
must 
come 
into 
it 
from 
the 
limitations 
or 
variations 
of 
a 
real 
genus 
or 
of 
a 
constant 
and 
absolute 
original 
nature. 
For 
it 
is 
thus 
that 
philosophers 
distinguish 
the 
modes 
of 
an 
absolute 
being 
from 
that 
being 
itself; 
as 
it 
is 
known 
that 
size, 
figure 
and 
movement 
are 
manifestly 
limitations 
and 
variations 
of 
corporeal 
nature. 
For 
it 
is 
clear 
in 
what 
way 
a 
limited 
extension 
gives 
figures, 
and 
that 
the 
change 
which 
is 
made 
in 
it 
is 
nothing 
but 
motion. 
And 
every 
time 
that 
we 
find 
some 
quality 
in 
a 
subject, 
we 
must 
believe 
that 
if 
we 
understood 
the 
nature 
of 
this 
subject 
and 
of 
this 
quality, 
we 
should 
conceive 
how 
this 
quality 
can 
result 
therefrom. 
Thus, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature 
(miracles 
set 
aside), 
it 
is 
not 
optional 
with 
God 
to 
give 
to 
substances 
indifferently 
such 
or 
such 
qualities, 
and 
he 
will 
never 
give 
them 
any 
but 
those 
which 
shall 
be 
natural 
to 
them; 
that 
is, 
which 
can 
be 
derivedfrom 
their 
nature 
as 
explicable 
modifications. 
Thus 
it 
may 
be 
asserted 
that 
matter 
will 
not 
naturally 
have 
the 
above 
mentioned 
attraction, 
and 
will 
not 
move 
of 
itself 
in 
a 
curved 
line, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
conceive 
how 
this 
takes 
place 
there; 
that 
is, 
to 
explain 
it 
mechanically; 
whereas 
that 
which 
is 
natural, 
must 
be 
able 
to 
become 
distinctly 
conceivable 
if 
we 
were 
admitted 
into 
the 
secrets 
of 
things. 
This 
distinction 
between 
what 
is 
natural 
and 
explicable 
and 
what 
is 
inexplicable 
and 
miraculous, 
removes 
all 
the 
difficulties; 
and 
by 
rejecting 
it, 
we 
should 
maintain 
something 
worse 
than 
the 
occult 
qualities; 
and 
in 
this 
we 
would 
renounce 
philosophy 
and 
reason, 
by 
opening 
retreats 
for 
ignorance 
and 
idleness, 
through 
a 
dead 
system 
which 
admits 
not 
only 
that 
there 
are 
qualities 
which 
we 
do 
not 
understand, 
of 
which 
there 
are 
only 
too 
many, 
but 
also 
that 
there 
are 
some 
which 
the 
greatest 
mind, 
if 
God 
gave 
him 
all 
the 
opening 
possible, 
could 
not 
comprehend; 
that 
is, 
which 
would 
be 
either 
miraculous 
or 
without 
rhyme 
and 
reason; 
and 
also 
that 
God 
should 
make 
miracles 
ordinarily, 
wouldbe 
without 
rhyme 
and 
reason,so 



that 
this 
useless 
hypothesis 
would 
destroy 
equally 
our 
philosophy 
which 
seeksreasons,anddivine 
wisdomwhichfurnishesthem. 


Now, 
as 
to 
thought, 
it 
is 
certain, 
and 
the 
author 
recognizes 
it 
more 
than 
once, 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
an 
intelligible 
modification 
of 
matter 
or 
one 
which 
could 
be 
comprehended 
and 
explained; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
feeling 
or 
thinking 
being 
is 
not 
a 
mechanical 
thing 
like 
a 
clock 
or 
a 
mill, 
such 
that 
we 
might 
conceive 
sizes, 
figures 
and 
movements, 
the 
mechanical 
conjunction 
of 
which 
might 
produce 
something 
thinking 
and 
even 
feeling 
in 
a 
mass 
in 
which 
there 
was 
nothing 
such, 
which 
should 
cease 
also 
in 
the 
same 
way 
by 
the 
irregularity 
of 
this 
mechanism. 
It 
is 
hence 
not 
natural 
to 
matter 
to 
feel 
and 
to 
think; 
and 
this 
can 
only 
take 
place 
within 
it 
in 
two 
ways, 
one 
of 
which 
will 
be 
that 
God 
should 
join 
to 
it 
a 
substance, 
to 
which 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
think, 
and 
the 
other 
that 
God 
should 
put 
thought 
in 
it 
by 
miracle. 
In 
this, 
then, 
I 
am 
entirely 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Cartesians, 
except 
that 
I 
extend 
it 
even 
to 
brutes 
and 
that 
I 
believe 
that 
they 
have 
feeling 
and 
immaterial 
souls 
(properly 
speaking) 
and 
are 
as 
imperishable 
as 
the 
atoms 
of 
Democritus 
or 
Gassendi; 
whereas 
the 
Cartesians, 
groundlessly 
embarrassed 
by 
the 
souls 
of 
brutes 
and 
not 
knowing 
what 
they 
are 
to 
do 
with 
them 
if 
they 
are 
preserved 
(for 
want 
of 
having 
bethought 
themselves 
of 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
same 
animal 
reduced 
to 
miniature), 
have 
been 
forced, 
contrary 
to 
all 
appearances 
and 
to 
the 
judgment 
ofthehuman 
race,to 
denyevenfeelingtobrutes. 


But 
if 
some 
one 
should 
say 
that 
God 
at 
least 
may 
add 
the 
faculty 
of 
thinking 
to 
the 
prepared 
mechanism, 
I 
would 
reply 
that 
if 
this 
were 
done 
and 
if 
God 
added 
this 
faculty 
to 
matter 
without 
depositing 
in 
it 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
substance 
which 
was 
the 
subject 
of 
inhesion 
of 
this 
same 
faculty 
(as 
I 
conceive 
it), 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
without 
adding 
to 
it 
an 
immaterial 
soul, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
matter 
should 
he 
miraculously 
exalted 
in 
order 
to 
receive 
a 
power 
of 
which 
it 
is 
notnaturally 
capable; 
as 
somescholastics 
claim 
that 
God 



exalts 
fire 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
giving 
it 
the 
force 
to 
burn 
immediately 
spirits 
separated 
from 
matter, 
a 
thing 
which 
would 
be 
a 
miracle, 
pure 
and 
simple. 
And 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
maintained 
that 
matter 
thinks 
without 
putting 
thereto 
an 
imperishable 
soul 
or 
a 
miracle, 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
immortality 
of 
our 
souls 
follows 
from 
that 
which 
is 
natural, 
since 
their 
extinction 
could 
be 
effected 
only 
by 
a 
miracle, 
whether 
by 
exacting 
matter 
or 
by 
annihilating 
the 
soul. 
For 
we 
well 
know 
that 
the 
power 
of 
God 
could 
render 
our 
souls 
mortal, 
however 
immaterial 
(or 
immortal 
by 
nature 
alone) 
theymaybe,forhecanannihilatethem. 


Now 
this 
truth 
of 
the 
immateriality 
of 
the 
soul 
is 
undoubtedly 
of 
importance. 
For 
it 
is 
infinitely 
more 
advantageous 
to 
religion 
and 
to 
morals, 
especially 
in 
the 
times 
in 
which 
we 
live 
(when 
many 
people 
hardly 
respect 
revelation 
alone 
and 
miracles), 
to 
show 
that 
souls 
are 
immortal 
naturally, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
a 
miracle 
if 
they 
were 
not, 
than 
to 
maintain 
that 
our 
souls 
ought 
naturally 
to 
die, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
by 
virtue 
of 
a 
miraculous 
grace, 
founded 
in 
the 
promise 
of 
God 
alone, 
that 
they 
do 
not 
die. 
Also 
for 
a 
long 
time 
it 
has 
been 
known 
that 
those 
who 
have 
wished 
to 
destroy 
natural 
religion 
and 
reduce 
all 
to 
revealed 
religion, 
as 
if 
reason 
taught 
us 
nothing 
concerning 
it, 
have 
been 
regarded 
with 
suspicion, 
and 
not 
always 
without 
reason. 
But 
our 
author 
is 
not 
of 
this 
number; 
he 
maintains 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
and 
he 
attributes 
to 
the 
immateriality 
of 
the 
soul 
a 
probability 
in 
the 
highest 
degree, 
which 
could 
pass 
consequently 
for 
a 
moral 
certainty, 
so 
that 
I 
imagine 
that, 
having 
as 
much 
sincerity 
as 
penetration, 
he 
could 
accommodate 
himself 
easily 
to 
the 
doctrine 
which 
I 
have 
just 
stated 
and 
which 
is 
fundamental 
in 
every 
rational 
philosophy; 
for 
otherwise 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
one 
can 
prevent 
himself 
from 
falling 
back 
into 
the 
fanatical 
philosophy, 
such 
as 
the 
Philosophia 
Mosaica 
of 
Fludd 
which 
saves 
all 
phenomena 
by 
attributing 
them 
to 
God 
immediately 
and 
by 
miracle, 
or 
into 
the 
barbaric 
philosophy, 



like 
that 
of 
certain 
philosophers 
and 
physicians 
of 
the 
past, 
which 
still 
bore 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
barbarity 
of 
their 
century 
and 
which 
is 
to-day 
with 
reason 
despised, 
who 
saved 
appearances 
by 
forging 
expressly 
occult 
qualities 
or 
faculties 
which 
they 
imagined 
to 
be 
like 
little 
demons 
or 
goblins 
capable 
of 
producing 
unceremoniously 
that 
which 
is 
demanded, 
just 
as 
if 
watches 
marked 
the 
hours 
by 
a 
certain 
horodeictic 
faculty 
without 
having 
need 
of 
wheels, 
or 
as 
if 
mills 
crushed 
grains 
by 
a 
fractive 
faculty 
without 
needing 
anything 
resemblingmill-stones. 
Astothedifficultywhichmany 
peoplehave 
had 
in 
conceiving 
an 
immaterial 
substance, 
it 
will 
easily 
cease 
(at 
least 
in 
good 
part) 
when 
they 
do 
not 
demand 
substances 
separated 
from 
matter;

BOOK 
I. 
—OF 
INNATE 
IDEAS. 



CHAPTERI. 
[II 
IN 
LOCKE.] 


Are 
there 
Innate 
Principles 
in 
the 
Mind 
of 
Man? 



IT 
IS 
NECESSARY 
that 
I 
tell 
you 
anew 
that 
I 
am 
no 
longer 
a 
Cartesian, 
and 
that 
nevertheless 
I 
am 
farther 
removed 
than 
ever 
from 
your 
Gassendi, 
whose 
knowledge 
and 
merit 
I 
elsewhere 
recognize. 
I 
have 
been 
impressed 
by 
a 
new 
system, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
read 
something 
in 
the 
philosophical 
journals 
of 
Paris, 
of 
Leipsic, 
and 
of 
Holland, 
and 
in 
the 
marvellous 
Dictionary 
of 
M. 
Bayle, 
article 
Rorarius; 
and 
since 
then 
I 
believe 
I 
see 
a 
new 
aspect 
of 
the 
interior 
of 
things. 
This 
system 
appears 
to 
unite 
Plato 
with 
Democritus, 
Aristotle 
with 
Descartes, 
the 
scholastics 
with 
the 
moderns, 
theology 
and 
ethics 
with 
reason. 
It 
seems 
to 
take 
the 
best 
from 
every 
side 
and 
then 
afterwards 
to 
go 
farther 
than 
any 
one 
has 
yet 
gone. 
I 
find 
in 
it 
an 
intelligible 
explanation 
of 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
body, 
a 
thing 
of 
which 
I 
had 
before 
despaired. 
I 
find 
the 
true 
principles 
of 
things 
in 
the 
Unities 
of 
Substance 
which 
this 
system 
introduces, 
and 
in 
their 
harmony 
preëstablished 
by 
the 
primitive 
substance. 
I 
find 
in 
it 
a 
surprising 
simplicity 
and 
uniformity, 
so 
that 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
everywhere 
and 
always 
the 
same 
thing, 
nearly 
in 
the 
degrees 
of 
perfection. 
I 
see 
now 
what 
Plato 
meant 
when 
he 
took 
matter 
for 
an 
imperfect 
and 
transitory 
entity, 
what 
Aristotle 
meant 
by 
his 
entelechy; 
what 
the 
promise 
which 
Democritus 
himself 
made 
of 
another 
life 
is, 
with 
Pliny; 
just 
how 
far 
the 
Sceptics 
were 
right 
in 
inveighing 
against 
the 
senses; 
how 
the 
animals 
are 
in 
reality 
automata 
according 
to 
Descartes, 
and 
how 
they 
have, 
nevertheless, 
souls 
and 
feeling 
according 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
human 
race; 
how 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
explain 
rationally 
those 
who 
have 
lodged 
life 
and 
perception 
in 
all 
things, 
like 
Cardan, 
Campanella, 
and 
better 
than 
they, 
the 
late 
Countess 
of 



Connaway, 
a 
Platonist, 
and 
our 
friend, 
the 
late 
M. 
François 
Mercure 
van 
Helmont 
(although 
elsewhere 
bristling 
with 
unintelligible 
paradoxes), 
with 
his 
friend, 
the 
late 
Mr. 
Henry 
More. 
How 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
(a 
large 
part 
of 
which 
were 
unknown 
before 
this 
system) 
have 
their 
origin 
in 
principles 
superior 
to 
matter, 
and 
how, 
nevertheless, 
everything 
takes 
place 
mechanically 
in 
matter; 
in 
which 
respect 
the 
spiritualistic 
authors 
whom 
I 
have 
just 
mentioned, 
had 
failed 
with 
their 
Archaei 
and 
even 
the 
Cartesians, 
in 
believing 
that 
immaterial 
substances 
changed 
if 
not 
the 
force, 
at 
least 
the 
direction 
or 
determination 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
bodies, 
whereas 
the 
soul 
and 
body 
perfectly 
retain 
their 
laws, 
each 
its 
own, 
according 
to 
the 
new 
system, 
and 
yet 
one 
obeys 
the 
other 
as 
far 
as 
is 
necessary. 
Finally, 
it 
is 
since 
I 
have 
meditated 
on 
this 
system 
that 
I 
have 
found 
out 
how 
the 
souls 
of 
brutes 
and 
their 
sensations 
are 
not 
at 
all 
prejudicial 
to 
the 
immortality 
of 
human 
souls, 
or, 
rather, 
how 
nothing 
is 
more 
adapted 
to 
establish 
our 
natural 
immortality 
than 
to 
conceive 
that 
all 
souls 
are 
imperishable 
(morte 
carent 
animae), 
without, 
however, 
there 
being 
metempsychoses 
to 
be 
feared, 
since 
not 
only 
souls 
but 
also 
animals 
remain 
and 
will 
remain 
living, 
feeling, 
acting; 
it 
is 
everywhere 
as 
here, 
and 
always 
and 
everywhere 
as 
with 
us, 
according 
to 
what 
I 
have 
already 
said 
to 
you. 
Unless 
it 
be 
that 
the 
states 
of 
animals 
are 
more 
or 
less 
perfect 
and 
developed, 
without 
there 
ever 
being 
need 
of 
souls 
altogether 
separate, 
while 
nevertheless, 
we 
always 
have 
minds 
as 
pure 
as 
possible, 
notwithstanding 
our 
organs, 
which 
cannot 
disturb 
by 
any 
influence, 
the 
laws 
of 
our 
spontaneity. 
I 
find 
the 
vacuum 
and 
atoms 
excluded 
very 
differently 
than 
by 
the 
sophism 
of 
the 
Cartesians, 
founded 
on 
the 
pretended 
coincidence 
between 
the 
idea 
of 
body 
and 
of 
extension. 
I 
see 
all 
things 
regulated 
and 
adorned 
beyond 
anything 
conceived 
of 
up 
to 
this 
time, 
matter 
everywhere 
organic, 
no 
sterile, 
neglected 
vacuum, 
nothing 
too 
uniform, 
everything 
varied 
but 
with 
order; 
and 
what 
surpasses 
the 
imagination, 
the 



whole 
universe 
in 
epitome, 
but 
with 
a 
different 
aspect 
in 
each 
of 
its 
parts 
and 
even 
in 
each 
of 
its 
unities 
of 
substance. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
new 
analysis 
of 
things, 
I 
have 
better 
understood 
that 
of 
notions 
or 
ideas 
and 
of 
truths. 
I 
understand 
what 
is 
a 
true, 
clear, 
distinct, 
adequate 
idea, 
if 
I 
dare 
adopt 
this 
word. 
I 
understand 
what 
are 
primitive 
truths, 
and 
true 
axioms, 
the 
distinction 
between 
necessary 
truths 
and 
those 
of 
fact, 
between 
the 
reasoning 
of 
men 
and 
the 
consecutions 
of 
brutes 
which 
are 
a 
shadow 
of 
it. 
Finally, 
you 
will 
be 
surprised, 
sir, 
to 
hear 
all 
that 
I 
have 
to 
say 
to 
you, 
and 
especially 
to 
understand 
how 
knowledge 
of 
the 
greatness 
and 
perfection 
of 
God 
is 
thereby 
exalted. 
For 
I 
cannot 
conceal 
from 
you, 
from 
whom 
I 
have 
had 
nothing 
secret, 
how 
much 
I 
am 
imbued 
now 
with 
admiration 
and 
(if 
we 
may 
venture 
to 
make 
use 
of 
this 
term) 
with 
love 
for 
this 
sovereign 
source 
of 
things 
and 
of 
beauties, 
having 
found 
that 
those 
which 
this 
system 
reveals, 
surpass 
everything 
hitherto 
conceived. 
You 
know 
that 
I 
had 
gone 
a 
little 
too 
far 
formerly, 
and 
that 
I 
began 
to 
incline 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
Spinozists, 
who 
leave 
only 
infinite 
power 
to 
God, 
without 
recognizing 
either 
perfection 
or 
wisdom 
as 
respects 
him, 
and, 
scorning 
the 
search 
after 
final 
causes, 
derive 
everything 
frombrutenecessity. 
Butthesenewlights 
havecured 
me 
ofthis. 


§ 
1. 
I 
have 
always 
favored, 
as 
I 
do 
still, 
the 
innate 
idea 
of 
God 
which 
M. 
Descartes 
maintained, 
and 
consequently 
other 
innate 
ideas 
which 
cannot 
come 
to 
us 
from 
the 
senses. 
Now 
I 
go 
still 
farther 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
new 
system, 
and 
I 
even 
believe 
that 
all 
the 
thoughts 
and 
actions 
of 
our 
soul 
come 
from 
its 
own 
depths 
and 
cannot 
be 
given 
to 
it 
by 
the 
senses, 
as 
you 
shall 
see 
in 
the 
sequel. 
But 
at 
present 
I 
shall 
set 
aside 
this 
investigation, 
and 
accommodating 
myself 
to 
the 
received 
expressions, 
since 
in 
truth 
they 
are 
good 
and 
maintainable 
and 
since 
in 
a 
sense 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
external 
senses 
are 
in 
part 
causes 
of 
our 
thoughts, 
I 
shall 
examine 
how 
in 
my 
opinion 
it 
must 
be 
said, 
even 
in 
the 
common 
system 
(speaking 
of 
the 
action 
of 
bodies 



on 
the 
soul, 
as 
the 
Copernicans 
speak 
with 
other 
men 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
sun, 
and 
with 
reason), 
that 
there 
are 
ideas 
and 
principles 
which 
do 
not 
come 
to 
us 
from 
the 
senses, 
and 
which 
we 
find 
in 
us 
without 
forming 
them, 
although 
thesensesgiveusoccasionto 
becomeconscious 
ofthem. 


I 
imagine 
that 
your 
able 
author 
has 
remarked 
that 
under 
the 
name 
of 
innate 
principles 
one 
often 
maintains 
his 
prejudices, 
and 
wishes 
to 
exempt 
himself 
from 
the 
trouble 
of 
discussions, 
and 
that 
this 
abuse 
has 
animated 
his 
zeal 
against 
this 
supposition. 
He 
has 
wished 
to 
combat 
the 
indolence 
and 
the 
superficial 
manner 
of 
thinking 
of 
those 
who, 
under 
the 
specious 
pretext 
of 
innate 
ideas 
and 
truths 
engraved 
naturally 
on 
the 
mind, 
to 
which 
we 
easily 
give 
assent, 
do 
not 
concern 
themselves 
with 
seeking 
and 
examining 
the 
sources, 
connections 
and 
certainty 
of 
this 
knowledge. 
In 
this 
I 
am 
altogether 
of 
his 
opinion, 
and 
I 
even 
see 
farther. 
I 
would 
that 
our 
analysis 
should 
not 
be 
limited, 
that 
definitions 
of 
all 
terms 
capable 
thereof 
should 
be 
given, 
and 
that 
all 
the 
axioms 
which 
are 
not 
primitive, 
should 
be 
demonstrated 
or 
the 
means 
of 
demonstrating 
them 
be 
given; 
without 
distinguishing 
the 
opinion 
which 
men 
have 
thereof, 
and 
without 
caring 
whether 
they 
give 
their 
consent 
thereto 
or 
not. 
This 
would 
be 
more 
useful 
than 
is 
thought. 
But 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
author 
has 
been 
carried 
too 
far 
on 
the 
other 
side 
by 
his 
zeal, 
otherwise 
highly 
praiseworthy. 
He 
has 
not 
sufficiently 
distinguished, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
the 
origin 
of 
necessary 
truths 
whose 
source 
is 
in 
the 
understanding, 
from 
that 
of 
the 
truths 
of 
fact, 
drawn 
from 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
even 
from 
the 
confused 
perceptions 
which 
are 
in 
us. 
You 
see 
therefore, 
sir, 
that 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
what 
you 
lay 
down 
as 
fact, 
that 
we 
can 
acquire 
all 
our 
knowledge 
without 
having 
need 
of 
innate 
impressions. 
And 
the 
sequel 
will 
show 
which 
ofus 
isright. 


§ 
§ 
2. 
3. 
4. 
I 
do 
not 
base 
the 
certainty 
of 
innate 
principles 
on 
universal 
consent, 
for 
I 
have 
already 
told 
you 
that 
my 
opinion 
is 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
labor 



to 
be 
able 
to 
prove 
all 
the 
axioms 
which 
are 
not 
primitive. 
I 
grant 
also 
that 
a 
consent 
very 
general, 
but 
which 
is 
not 
universal, 
may 
come 
from 
a 
tradition 
diffused 
throughout 
the 
human 
race, 
as 
the 
practice 
of 
smoking 
tobacco 
has 
been 
received 
by 
almost 
all 
nations 
in 
less 
than 
a 
century, 
although 
some 
islandershave 
beenfound 
who,notknowingevenfire,wereunableto 
smoke. 
Thus 
some 
able 
people, 
even 
among 
theologians, 
but 
of 
the 
party 
of 
Arminius, 
have 
believed 
that 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Divinity 
came 
from 
a 
very 
ancient 
and 
general 
tradition; 
and 
I 
believe 
indeed, 
that 
instruction 
has 
confirmed 
and 
rectified 
this 
knowledge. 
It 
appears, 
however, 
that 
nature 
has 
aided 
in 
reaching 
it 
without 
instruction; 
the 
marvels 
of 
the 
universe 
have 
madeusthinkof 
asuperiorpower. 
Achildborndeafanddumb 
has 
beenseen 
to 
show 
veneration 
for 
the 
full 
moon, 
and 
nations 
have 
been 
found 
who 
seemed 
not 
to 
have 
learned 
anything 
else 
of 
other 
people, 
fearing 
invisible 
powers. 
I 
grant 
that 
this 
is 
not 
yet 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
such 
as 
we 
have 
it 
and 
as 
we 
demand; 
but 
this 
idea 
itself 
does 
not, 
cease 
to 
be 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
our 
souls, 
withoutbeing 
placedthere, 
as 
weshall 
see,and 
the 
eternallaws 
of 
God 
are 
in 
part 
engraved 
thereon 
in 
a 
way 
still 
more 
legible, 
and 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
instinct. 
But, 
they 
are 
practical 
principles 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
also 
have 
occasion 
to 
speak. 
It 
must 
be 
admitted, 
however, 
that 
the 
inclination 
which 
we 
have 
to 
recognize 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
lies 
in 
human 
nature. 
And 
even 
if 
the 
first 
instruction 
therein 
should 
be 
attributed 
to 
Revelation, 
the 
readiness 
which 
men 
have 
always 
shown 
to 
receive 
this 
doctrine 
comes 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
souls. 
I 
conclude 
that 
a 
sufficiently 
general 
consent 
among 
men 
is 
an 
indication 
and 
not 
a 
demonstration 
of 
an 
innate 
principle; 
but 
that 
the 
exact 
and 
decisive 
proof 
of 
these 
principles 
consists 
in 
showing 
that 
their 
certainty 
comes 
only 
from 
what 
is 
in 
us. 
To 
reply 
again 
to 
what 
you 
say 
against 
the 
general 
approbation 
given 
to 
the 
two 
great 
speculative 
principles, 
which 
are 
nevertheless 
the 
best 
established, 
I 
may 
say 
to 
you 
that 
even 
if 
they 
were 
not 



known, 
they 
would 
none 
the 
less 
be 
innate, 
because 
they 
are 
recognized 
as 
soon 
as 
heard; 
but 
I 
will 
add 
further, 
that 
at 
bottom 
everyone 
knows 
them 
and 
makes 
use 
at, 
every 
moment 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction 
(for 
example) 
without 
examining 
it 
distinctly, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
barbarian, 
who, 
in 
a 
matter 
which 
heconsidersserious, 
wouldnotbeshockedat 
theconductof 
aliarwho 
contradicts 
himself. 
Thus 
these 
maxims 
are 
employed 
without 
being 
expressly 
considered. 
And 
it 
is 
very 
much 
so 
that 
we 
have 
virtually 
in 
the 
mind 
the 
propositions 
suppressed 
in 
enthymemes, 
which 
are 
set 
aside 
not 
onlyexternally,butalsoinourthought. 


§ 
5. 
Not 
on 
the 
mind 
naturally 
imprinted, 
because 
not 
known 
to 
children, 
idiots, 
dec.] 
If 
you 
are 
so 
prejudiced 
as 
to 
say 
that 
there 
are 
truths 
imprinted 
on 
the 
soul 
which 
it 
does 
not 
perceive, 
am 
not 
surprised 
that 
you 
reject 
innate 
knowledge. 
But 
I 
am 
astonished 
that 
it 
has 
not 
occurred 
to 
you 
that 
we 
have 
an 
infinity 
of 
knowledge 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
always 
conscious, 
not 
even 
when 
we 
have 
need 
of 
it. 
It 
is 
for 
memory 
to 
retain 
it 
and 
for 
reminiscence 
to 
represent 
it 
to 
us, 
as 
it 
often 
does, 
but 
not 
always 
when 
needed. 
This 
is 
very 
well 
called 
remembrance 
(subvenire), 
for 
reminiscence 
requires 
some 
help. 
And 
it 
must 
he 
that 
in 
this 
multiplicity 
of 
our 
knowledge 
we 
are 
determined 
by 
something 
to 
renew 
one 
rather 
than 
another, 
since 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
think 
distinctly 
and 
at 
once 
of 
all 
that 
we 
know. 
In 
a 
sense 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
all 
arithmetic 
and 
all 
geometry 
are 
innate 
and 
are 
in 
us 
virtually, 
so 
that 
they 
may 
be 
found 
there 
if 
we 
consider 
attentively 
and 
arrange 
what 
is 
already 
in 
the 
mind, 
without 
making 
use 
of 
any 
truth 
learned 
by 
experience 
or 
by 
the 
tradition 
of 
others, 
as 
Plato 
has 
shown 
in 
a 
dialogue, 
where 
he 
introduces 
Socrates 
leading 
a 
child 
to 
abstract 
truths 
by 
mere 
questions, 
without 
telling 
him 
anything. 
We 
may 
therefore 
invent 
these 
sciences 
in 
our 
libraries 
and 
even 
with 
closed 
eyes, 
without 
learning 
by 
sight 
or 
even 
by 
touch, 
the 
truths 



which 
we 
need; 
although 
it 
is 
true 
that 
we 
would 
not 
consider 
the 
ideas 
in 
question 
ifwehadnever 
seenortouchedanything. 


Since 
an 
acquired 
knowledge 
may 
be 
concealed 
in 
the 
soul 
by 
the 
memory, 
as 
you 
admit, 
why 
could 
not 
nature 
have 
also 
hidden 
there 
some 
original 
knowledge? 
Must 
everything 
which 
is 
natural 
to 
a 
substance 
which 
knows 
itself, 
be 
known 
there 
actually 
in 
the 
beginning? 
Can 
not 
and 
must 
not 
this 
substance 
(such 
as 
our 
soul), 
have 
many 
properties 
and 
modifications, 
all 
of 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
consider 
at 
first 
and 
altogether?Itwasthe 
opinion 
of 
the 
Platonists 
that 
all 
our 
knowledge 
was 
reminiscence 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
truths 
which 
the 
soul 
has 
brought 
along 
at 
the 
birth 
of 
the 
man 
and 
which 
are 
called 
innate, 
must 
be 
the 
remains 
of 
an 
express 
anterior 
knowledge. 
But 
this 
opinion 
has 
no 
foundation. 
And 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
judge 
that 
the 
soul 
must 
already 
have 
innate 
knowledge 
in 
the 
preceding 
state 
(if 
pre-existence 
were 
a 
fact), 
however 
distant 
it 
might 
be, 
just 
as 
here; 
it 
therefore 
would 
have 
to 
come 
also 
from 
another 
preceding 
state, 
or 
it 
would 
be 
finally 
innate 
or 
at 
least 
concreate, 
or 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
infinite 
and 
make 
souls 
eternal, 
in 
which 
case 
this 
knowledge 
would 
be 
innate 
in 
truth, 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
would 
never 
have 
a 
beginning 
in 
the 
soul; 
and 
if 
someone 
claimed 
that 
each 
anterior 
state 
has 
had 
somethingfrom 
another 
more 
anteriorwhich 
it 
has 
not 
left 
to 
the 
succeeding, 
the 
reply 
will 
be 
made, 
that 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
certain 
evident 
truths 
must 
have 
been 
in 
all 
these 
states. 
And 
in 
whatever 
way 
it 
may 
be 
taken, 
it 
is 
always 
clear 
in 
all 
the 
states 
of 
the 
soul 
that 
necessary 
truths 
are 
innate 
and 
are 
proved 
by 
what 
is 
internal, 
it 
not 
being 
possible 
to 
establish 
them 
by 
experiences 
as 
we 
establish 
truths 
of 
fact. 
Why 
should 
it 
be 
necessary 
also 
that 
we 
could 
possess 
nothing 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
which 
we 
had 
never 
made 
use? 
And 
is 
to 
have 
a 
thing 
without 
making 
use 
of 
it 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
to 
have 
merely 
the 
faculty 
of 
acquiring 
it? 
If 
it 
were 
so, 
we 
should 
never 
possess 
anything 
except 
the 
things 
which 
we 
enjoy; 
whereas 
we 
know 



that 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
faculty 
and 
the 
object, 
there 
must 
often 
be 
some 
disposition 
in 
the 
faculty 
or 
in 
the 
object 
or 
in 
both, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
faculty 
beexercisedupontheobject. 


If 
the 
mind 
had 
only 
the 
simple 
capacity 
of 
receiving 
knowledge 
or 
passive 
power 
for 
that, 
as 
indeterminate 
as 
that 
which 
the 
wax 
has 
for 
receiving 
figures, 
and 
a 
blank 
tablet 
for 
receiving 
letters, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
the 
source 
of 
necessary 
truths, 
as 
I 
have 
just 
shown 
it 
to 
be; 
for 
it 
is 
incontestable 
that 
the 
senses 
do 
not 
suffice 
to 
show 
their 
necessity, 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
mind 
has 
a 
disposition 
(as 
much 
active 
as 
passive) 
to 
draw 
them 
itself 
from 
its 
depths; 
although 
the 
senses 
are 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
give 
it 
the 
occasion 
and 
attention 
for 
this, 
and 
to 
carry 
it 
to 
some 
rather 
than 
to 
others. 
You 
see, 
therefore, 
sir, 
that 
these 
people, 
otherwise 
very 
able, 
who 
are 
of 
a 
different 
opinion, 
seem 
not 
to 
have 
sufficiently 
meditated 
on 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
difference 
which 
there 
is 
between 
necessary 
or 
eternal 
truths 
and 
the 
truths 
of 
experience, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
remarked, 
and 
as 
all 
our 
discussion 
shows. 
The 
original 
proof 
of 
the 
necessary 
truths 
comes 
from 
the 
understanding 
alone, 
and 
the 
other 
truths 
come 
from 
experiences 
or 
from 
the 
observations 
of 
the 
senses. 
Our 
mind 
is 
capable 
of 
knowing 
both, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
source 
of 
the 
former; 
and 
whatever 
number 
of 
particular 
experiences 
we 
may 
have 
of 
a 
universal 
truth, 
we 
could 
not 
be 
assured 
of 
it 
forever 
by 
induction, 
without 
knowing 
itsnecessitythroughthereason. 


§ 
11. 
It 
is 
the 
particular 
relation 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
to 
these 
truths 
which 
renders 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
faculty 
easy 
and 
natural 
as 
respects 
them, 
and 
which 
causes 
them 
to 
be 
called 
innate. 
It 
is 
therefore, 
not 
a 
naked 
faculty 
which 
consists 
in 
the 
mere 
possibility 
of 
understanding 
them; 
it 
is 
a 
disposition,anaptitude,apreformation, 
whichdetermines 
oursouland 
which 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
they 
may 
be 
derived 
from 
it. 
Just 
as 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
the 
figures 
which 
are 
given 
to 
the 
stone 
or 
marble 
indifferently, 
and 



those 
which 
its 
veins 
already 
mark 
out 
or 
are 
disposed 
to 
mark 
out 
if 
the 
workmanprofits 
bythem. 


The 
intellectual 
ideas, 
which 
are 
the 
source 
of 
necessary 
truths, 
do 
not 
comefrom 
thesenses; 
and 
you 
recognize 
that 
there 
areideas 
which 
are 
due 
to 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
mind 
when 
it 
reflects 
upon 
itself. 
For 
the 
rest, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
express 
knowledge 
of 
truths 
is 
posterior 
(tempore 
vel 
natura) 
to 
the 
express 
knowledge 
of 
ideas; 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
truths 
depends 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
ideas, 
before 
we 
expressly 
form 
one 
or 
the 
other, 
and 
the 
truths 
into 
which 
the 
ideas 
which 
come 
from 
the 
senses 
enter, 
depend 
on 
the 
senses, 
at 
least 
in 
part. 
But 
the 
ideas 
which 
come 
from 
the 
senses 
are 
confused, 
and 
the 
truths 
which 
depend 
upon 
them 
are 
confused 
also, 
at 
least 
in 
part; 
whereas 
the 
intellectual 
ideas 
and 
the 
truths 
which 
depend 
on 
them, 
are 
distinct, 
and 
neither 
the 
one 
class 
nor 
the 
other 
has 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
senses, 
although 
it 
may 
betrue 
thatwewouldnever 
think 
ofthemwithoutthesenses. 


§ 
18. 
[If 
such 
am, 
assent 
be 
a 
mark 
of 
innate, 
then, 
that 
one 
and 
two 
are 
equal 
to 
three, 
that 
sweetness 
is 
not 
bitterness, 
and 
a 
thousand 
the 
like, 
must 
be 
innate.] 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
this: 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
is 
not 
different, 
can 
be 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction, 
and 
easier; 
for 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
you 
give 
yourself 
more 
liberty 
by 
advancing 
that 
A 
is 
not 
B, 
than 
by 
saying 
thatA 
isnotnon-A. 
Andthereason 
whichpreventsAfrombeingB,is 
that 
Bincludesnon-A. 
Fortherest,theproposition:thesweetisnotthebitter, 
is 
not 
innate, 
according 
to 
the 
meaning 
which 
we 
have 
given 
to 
the 
term 
innate 
truth. 
For 
the 
feelings 
of 
sweet 
and 
of 
bitter 
come 
from 
the 
external 
senses. 
Thus 
it 
is 
a 
mixed 
conclusion 
(hybrida 
conclusio), 
where 
the 
axiom 
is 
applied 
to 
a 
sensible 
truth. 
But 
as 
for 
this 
proposition: 
the 
square 
is 
not 
a 
circle, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
to 
be 
innate, 
for 
in 
considering 
it, 
you 
make 
a 
subsumption 
or 
application 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction 
to 
what 
the 



understanding 
itself 
furnishes 
as 
soon 
as 
you 
are 
conscious 
of 
innate 
thoughts. 


§ 
19. 
[Such 
less 
general 
propositions 
known 
before 
these 
universal 
maxims.] 
We 
build 
on 
these 
general 
maxims, 
as 
we 
build 
on 
majors 
which 
are 
suppressed 
when 
we 
reason 
by 
enthymemes; 
for 
although 
very 
often 
we 
do 
not 
think 
distinctly 
of 
what 
we 
do 
in 
reasoning, 
any 
more 
than 
of 
what 
we 
do 
in 
walking 
and 
jumping, 
it 
is 
always 
true 
that 
the 
force 
of 
the 
conclusion 
consists 
partly 
in 
what 
is 
suppressed 
and 
could 
not 
come 
from 
elsewhere, 
as 
willbe 
found 
ifyoushouldwish 
toproveit. 


§ 
20. 
[One 
and 
one 
equal 
to 
two, 
&c. 
not 
general 
nor 
useful, 
answered.] 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
begin 
sooner 
to 
perceive 
particular 
truths, 
when 
we 
begin 
by 
more 
composite 
and 
gross 
ideas; 
but 
this 
does 
not 
prevent 
the 
order 
of 
nature 
from 
beginning 
with 
the 
most 
simple, 
and 
the 
reason 
of 
more 
particular 
truths 
from 
depending 
on 
the 
more 
general, 
of 
which 
they 
are 
only 
examples. 
And 
when 
we 
wish 
to 
consider 
what 
is 
in 
us 
virtually, 
and 
before 
all 
apperception, 
we 
are 
right 
in 
beginning 
with 
the 
most 
simple. 
For 
the 
general 
principles 
enter 
into 
our 
thoughts, 
of 
which 
they 
form 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
connection. 
They 
are 
as 
necessary 
to 
it 
as 
the 
muscles 
and 
sinews 
are 
for 
walking, 
although 
we 
do 
not 
think 
of 
it. 
The 
mind 
leans 
upon 
these 
principles 
at 
all 
times, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
so 
easily 
come 
to 
distinguish 
them 
and 
to 
represent 
them 
to 
itself 
distinctly 
and 
separately, 
because 
that 
requires 
great 
attention 
to 
what 
it 
does, 
and 
most 
people, 
little 
accustomed 
to 
meditate, 
have 
hardly 
any. 
Have 
not 
the 
Chinese, 
like 
ourselves, 
articulate 
sounds? 
and 
yet 
being 
attached 
to 
another 
way 
of 
writing, 
they 
have 
not 
yet 
thought 
of 
making 
an 
alphabet 
of 
these 
sounds. 
Itisthusthatone 
possessesmanythings 
without 
knowingit. 


§ 
21. 
[These 
maxims 
not 
being 
known 
sometimes 
till 
proposed, 
proves 
them 
not 
innate.] 
The 
nature 
of 
things 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind 
agree. 
And 
since 
you 
oppose 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
thing 
to 
the 
apperception 
of 
that 



which 
is 
engraved 
on 
the 
mind, 
this 
objection 
itself 
shows, 
sir, 
that 
those 
whose 
side 
you 
take, 
understand 
by 
innate 
truths 
only 
those 
which 
would 
be 
approved 
naturally 
as 
by 
instinct, 
and 
even 
without 
knowing 
it, 
unless 
confusedly. 
There 
are 
some 
of 
this 
nature, 
and 
we 
shall 
have 
occasion 
to 
speak 
of 
them. 
But 
that 
which 
is 
called 
natural 
light 
supposes 
a 
distinct 
knowledge, 
and 
very 
often 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
our 
mind 
and 
of 
these 
innate 
ideas 
which 
we 
do 
not 
need 
to 
seek 
outside. 
Thus 
I 
call 
innate, 
those 
truths 
which 
need 
onlythis 
considerationinorder 
to 
beverified. 
I 
have 
already 
replied 
§ 
5, 
to 
the 
objection 
§ 
22, 
which 
claimed 
that 
when 
it 
is 
said 
that 
innate 
ideas 
are 
implicitly 
in 
the 
mind, 
this 
must 
mean 
simply, 
that 
it 
has 
the 
faculty 
of 
knowing 
them; 
for 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
this, 
it 
has 
the 
faculty 
of 
finding 
them 
in 
itself, 
and 
the 
disposition 
to 
approve 
them 
when 
it 
thinks 
of 
themasitshould. 


§ 
23. 
[The 
argument 
of 
assenting 
on 
first 
hearing, 
is 
upon 
a 
false 
supposition 
of 
no 
precedent 
teaching. 
] 
I 
would 
name 
as 
propositions 
whose 
ideas 
are 
innate, 
the 
propositions 
of 
arithmetic 
and 
geometry, 
which 
are 
all 
of 
this 
nature,andasregards 
necessary 
truths, 
nootherscouldbe 
found. 


§ 
25. 
[These 
maxims 
not 
the 
first 
known.] 
The 
apperception 
of 
that 
which 
is 
in 
us, 
depends 
upon 
attention 
and 
order. 
Now, 
it 
is 
not 
only 
possible, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
proper, 
that 
children 
pay 
more 
attention 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
senses, 
because 
the 
attention 
is 
regulated 
by 
the 
need. 
The 
result, 
however, 
shows 
in 
the 
sequel, 
that 
nature 
has 
not 
uselessly 
given 
herself 
the 
trouble 
of 
impressing 
upon 
us 
innate 
knowledge, 
since 
without 
it 
there 
would 
be 
no 
means 
of 
arriving 
at 
actual 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truths 
necessary 
in 
the 
demonstrative 
sciences, 
and 
at 
the 
reasons 
of 
facts; 
and 
we 
should 
possess 
nothingabovethe 
brutes. 



§ 
26. 
[And 
so 
not 
innate.] 
Not 
at 
all, 
for 
thoughts 
are 
actions; 
and 
knowledge 
or 
truths, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
in 
us, 
even 
when 
we 
do 
not 
think 
of 
them, 
are 
habits 
or 
dispositions; 
and 
we 
know 
very 
many 
things 
of 
which 
we 
hardlythink. 


[It 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
conceive 
that 
a 
truth 
be 
in 
the 
mind, 
if 
the 
mind 
has 
never 
thought 
of 
this 
truth.] 


It 
is 
as 
if 
someone 
said 
that 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
conceive 
that 
there 
are 
veins 
in 
marble 
before 
they 
are 
discovered. 
This 
objection 
also 
seems 
to 
approach 
a 
little 
too 
much 
the 
petitio 
principii. 
All 
those 
who 
admit 
innate 
truths 
without 
basing 
them 
upon 
the 
Platonic 
reminiscence, 
admit 
those 
of 
which 
they 
have 
not 
yet 
thought. 
Moreover, 
this 
reasoning 
proves 
too 
much; 
for 
if 
truths 
are 
thoughts, 
we 
should 
be 
deprived 
not 
only 
of 
the 
truths 
of 
which 
we 
have 
never 
thought, 
but 
also 
of 
those 
of 
which 
we 
have 
thought 
and 
of 
which 
we 
no 
longer 
actually 
think; 
and 
if 
truths 
are 
not 
thoughts 
but 
habits, 
and 
aptitudes, 
natural 
or 
acquired, 
nothing 
prevents 
there 
being 
some 
in 
us 
of 
which 
we 
havenever 
thought,norwillever 
think. 


§ 
27. 
[Not 
innate, 
because 
they 
appear 
least 
where 
what 
is 
innate 
shows 
itself 
clearest.] 
I 
believe 
that 
we 
must 
reason 
here 
very 
differently. 
Innate 
maxims, 
appear 
only 
through 
the 
attention 
which 
is 
given 
them; 
but 
these 
persons 
[children, 
idiots, 
savages], 
haveverylittleof 
it,or 
haveitforentirely 
different 
things. 
They 
think 
of 
hardly 
anything 
except 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
body; 
and 
it 
is 
reasonable 
that 
pure 
and 
detached 
thoughts 
should 
be 
the 
prize 
of 
nobler 
pains. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
children 
and 
savages 
have 
the 
mind 
less 
altered 
by 
customs, 
but 
they 
also 
have 
it 
exalted 
by 
the 
teaching 
which 
gives 
attention. 
It 
would 
not 
be 
very 
just 
that 
the 
brightest 
lights 
should 
burn 
better 
in 
minds 
which 
deserve 
them 
less, 
and 
which 
are 
enveloped 
in 
thicker 
clouds. 
I 
would 
not 
like 
one 
to 
give 
too 
much 
honor 
to 
ignorance 
and 
barbarity, 
when 
one 
is 
as 
learned 
and 
as 
clever 
as 
you 
are; 
that 
would 
be 
to 
depreciate 
the 
gifts 
of 



God. 
Some 
one 
will 
say, 
that 
the 
more 
ignorant 
one 
is, 
the 
nearer 
he 
will 
approach 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
a 
block 
of 
marble 
or 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
wood, 
which 
are 
infallible 
and 
sinless. 
But 
unfortunately, 
it 
is 
not 
in 
this 
way 
that 
one 
approaches 
thereto; 
and 
as 
far 
as 
we 
are 
capable 
of 
knowledge, 
we 
sin 
in 
neglecting 
to 
acquire 
it, 
and 
we 
shall 
fail 
so 
much 
the 
more 
easily 
as 
we 
are 
less 
instructed.

OF

CHAPTER 
I. 


Of 
Ideas 
in 
general, 
and 
whether 
the 
soul 
always 
thinks. 



§ 
1. 
[IDEA 
istheobjectofthinking.] 
Iadmitit,providedthatyouaddthat 
it 
is 
an 
immediate 
internal 
object, 
and 
that 
this 
object 
is 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
nature 
or 
of 
the 
qualities 
of 
things. 
If 
the 
idea 
were 
the 
form 
of 
thought, 
it 
would 
come 
into 
existence, 
and 
would 
cease 
with 
the 
actual 
thoughts 
which 
correspond 
to 
it; 
but 
in 
being 
its 
object 
it 
might 
be 
anterior 
and 
posterior 
to 
thoughts. 
The 
external 
sensible 
objects 
are 
but 
mediate, 
because 
they 
cannot 
act 
immediately 
upon 
the 
soul. 
God 
alone 
is 
the 
immediate 
external 
object. 
It 
might 
be 
said 
that 
the 
soul 
itself 
is 
its 
own 
immediate 
internal 
object; 
but 
it 
is 
so 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
contains 
ideas 
or 
what 
corresponds 
to 
things; 
for 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
microcosm 
in 
which 
distinct 
ideas 
are 
a 
representation 
of 
God, 
and 
in 
which 
confusedideasarearepresentationoftheuniverse. 


§ 
2. 
[All 
ideas 
come 
from 
sensation 
or 
reflection.] 
The 
tabula 
rasa, 
of 
which 
so 
much 
is 
said, 
is, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
a 
fiction 
which 
nature 
does 
not 
admit 
of, 
and 
which 
has 
its 
foundation 
in 
the 
incomplete 
notions 
of 
philosophers, 
like 
the 
vacuum, 
atoms, 
and 
rest, 
absolute 
or 
relative, 
of 
two 
parts 
of 
a 
whole, 
or 
like 
the 
materia 
prima 
which 
is 
conceived 
as 
without 
form. 
Uniform 
things 
and 
those 
which 
contain 
no 
variety, 
are 
never 
anything 
but 
abstractions, 
like 
time, 
space, 
and 
the 
other 
entities 
of 
pure 
mathematics. 
There 
is 
no 
body, 
the 
parts 
of 
which 
are 
at 
rest, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
substance 
which 
has 
nothing 
by 
which 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
every 
other. 
Human 
souls 
differ 
not 
only 
from 
other 
souls, 
but 
also 
among 
themselves, 
although 
the 
difference 
is 
not 
of 
the 
nature 
which 
is 
called 
specific. 
And 
according 
to 
the 
demonstrations, 
which 
I 
think 
I 
have, 
everything 
substantial, 
whether 
soul 
or 



body, 
has 
its 
relation, 
which 
is 
peculiar 
to 
itself, 
to 
each 
of 
the 
others, 
and 
the 
one 
must 
always 
differ 
from 
the 
other 
by 
intrinsic 
characteristics; 
not 
to 
mention 
that 
those 
who 
speak 
so 
much 
of 
this 
tabula 
rasa, 
after 
having 
taken 
away 
from 
it 
ideas 
are 
not 
able 
to 
say 
what 
is 
left 
to 
it, 
like 
the 
scholastic 
philosophers 
who 
leave 
nothing 
to 
their 
materia 
prima. 
It 
may, 
perhaps, 
be 
answered 
that 
this 
tabula 
rasa 
of 
the 
philosophers 
means 
that 
the 
soul 
has 
naturally 
and 
originally 
only 
bare 
faculties. 
But 
faculties 
without 
some 
act, 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
pure 
powers 
of 
the 
school, 
are 
also 
but 
fictions 
unknown 
to 
nature, 
and 
which 
are 
obtained 
only 
by 
abstraction. 
For 
where 
in 
the 
world 
will 
there 
ever 
be 
found 
a 
faculty 
which 
confines 
itself 
to 
the 
mere 
power, 
without 
exercising 
any 
act? 
There 
is 
always 
a 
particular 
disposition 
to 
action, 
and 
to 
one 
action 
rather 
than 
to 
another. 
And 
besides 
the 
disposition, 
there 
is 
a 
tendency 
to 
action, 
of 
which 
tendencies 
there 
is 
always 
an 
infinity 
at 
once 
in 
each 
subject; 
and 
these 
tendencies 
are 
never 
without 
some 
effect. 
Experience 
is, 
I 
admit, 
necessary 
in 
order 
that 
the 
soul 
be 
determined 
to 
such 
or 
such 
thoughts, 
and 
in 
order 
that 
it 
take 
notice 
of 
the 
ideas 
which 
are 
in 
us; 
but 
by 
what 
means 
can 
experience 
and 
the 
senses 
give 
ideas? 
Has 
the 
soul 
windows? 
does 
it 
resemble 
tablets? 
is 
it 
like 
wax? 
It 
is 
evident 
that 
all 
who 
think 
of 
the 
soul 
thus, 
make 
it 
at 
bottom 
corporeal. 
This 
axiom 
received 
among 
the 
philosophers, 
will 
be 
opposed 
to 
me, 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
soul 
which 
does 
not 
come 
from 
the 
senses. 
But 
the 
soul 
itself 
and 
its 
affections 
must 
be 
excepted. 
Nihil 
est 
in 
intellectu, 
quod, 
non 
fuerit 
in 
sensu, 
excipe: 
nisi 
ipse 
intellectus. 
blow 
the 
soul 
comprises 
being, 
substance, 
unity, 
identity, 
cause, 
perception, 
reason, 
and 
many 
other 
notions 
which 
the 
senses 
cannotgive. 


In 
order 
to 
avoid 
a 
discussion 
upon 
what 
has 
delayed 
us 
too 
long, 
I 
declare 
to 
you 
in 
advance, 
sir, 
that 
when 
you 
say 
that 
ideas 
come 
to 
us 
from 
one 
or 
the 
other 
of 
these 
causes 
[sensation 
or 
reflection], 
I 
understand 
it 
of 
their 



actual 
perception, 
for 
I 
think 
that 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
they 
are 
in 
us 
before 
they 
areperceived,sofaras 
theyhaveanything 
distinctabout 
them. 


§§ 
9 
and 
10. 
[The 
soul 
begins 
to 
home 
ideas 
when 
it 
begins 
to 
perceive. 
The 
soul 
thinks 
not 
always.] 
Action 
is 
no 
more 
connected 
with 
the 
soul 
than 
with 
body; 
a 
state 
without 
thought 
in 
the 
soul 
and 
an 
absolute 
repose 
in 
body, 
appear 
to 
me 
equally 
contrary 
to 
nature 
and 
without 
example 
in 
the 
world. 
A 
substance 
once 
in 
action 
will 
be 
so 
always, 
for 
all 
the 
impressions 
remain 
and 
are 
merely 
mixed 
with 
other 
new 
ones. 
By 
striking 
a 
body 
we 
excite 
or 
rather 
determineaninfinityofvortices,as 
inaliquid,foratbottomeverysolidhasa 
degree 
of 
liquidity, 
and 
every 
liquid 
a 
degree 
of 
solidity, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
means 
of 
ever 
arresting 
entirely 
these 
internal 
vortices. 
Now 
we 
may 
believe 
that 
if 
body 
is 
never 
in 
repose, 
the 
soul, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
it, 
will 
never 
be 
withoutperception 
either. 


It 
is 
certain 
that 
we 
slumber 
and 
sleep, 
and 
that 
God 
is 
exempt 
from 
this. 
But 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
while 
sleeping 
we 
are 
without 
perception. 
Bather 
justthe 
oppositeisfound 
tobethecase,ifitiswellconsidered. 


Beal 
powers 
are 
never 
simple 
possibilities. 
There 
is 
always 
tendency 
and 
action. 


I 
do 
not 
say 
that 
it 
is 
self-evident 
that 
the 
soul 
always 
thinks. 
A 
little 
attention 
and 
reasoning 
is 
needed 
to 
discover 
it. 
The 
commonpeopleperceive 
it 
aslittleasthepressureoftheairortheroundnessofthe 
earth. 


It 
is 
decided 
as 
it 
is 
proved 
that 
there 
are 
imperceptible 
bodies 
and 
invisible 
movements, 
although 
certain 
persons 
ridicule 
them. 
There 
are 
likewise, 
numberless 
perceptions 
which 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
distinguished 
for 
them 
to 
be 
perceived 
or 
remembered, 
but 
they 
are 
made 
known 
by 
certain 
consequences. 


I 
have 
not 
read 
the 
book 
which 
contains 
this 
objection 
[that 
it 
is 
an 
inference 
from 
Locke’s 
position, 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
not, 
because 
we 
are 
not 



sensible 
of 
it 
in 
our 
sleep], 
but 
it 
would 
pot 
have 
been 
wrong 
to 
object 
to 
you, 
that 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
because 
the 
thought 
is 
not 
perceived 
that 
it 
ceases 
for 
that 
reason; 
for 
otherwise 
it 
could 
be 
said 
for 
the 
same 
reason, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
soul 
during 
the 
time 
when 
it 
is 
not 
perceived. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
refute 
this 
objection 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
point 
out 
in 
particular 
of 
the 
thought 
that 
it 
is 
essentialtoitthatit 
beperceived. 


§ 
11. 
[It 
is 
not 
always 
conscious 
of 
it.] 
There 
[that 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
conceive 
that 
a 
thing 
can 
think 
and 
not 
be 
conscious 
that 
it 
thinks] 
is, 
undoubtedly, 
the 
knot 
of 
the 
affair 
and 
the 
difficulty 
which 
has 
embarrassed 
able 
men. 
But 
here 
is 
the 
means 
ofgetting 
outof 
it. 
Wemust 
consider 
that 
we 
think 
of 
many 
things 
at 
once, 
but 
we 
attend 
only 
to 
the 
thoughts 
which 
are 
most 
important; 
and 
it 
could 
not 
be 
otherwise, 
for 
if 
we 
attend 
to 
all 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
think 
attentively 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
things 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
all 
of 
which 
we 
feel 
and 
which 
make 
an 
impression 
upon 
our 
senses. 
I 
say 
even 
more: 
there 
remains 
something 
of 
all 
our 
past 
thoughts 
and 
none 
can 
ever 
be 
entirely 
effaced. 
Now 
when 
we 
sleep 
without 
dreaming 
and 
when 
we 
are 
stunned 
by 
some 
blow, 
fall, 
symptom 
or 
other 
accident, 
there 
is 
formed 
within 
us 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
minute 
confused 
sensations, 
and 
death 
itself 
can 
produce 
no 
other 
effect 
upon 
the 
souls 
of 
animals 
who 
without 
doubt 
ought, 
sooner 
or 
later, 
to 
acquire 
important 
perceptions, 
for 
all 
goes 
in 
an 
orderly 
manner 
in 
nature. 
I 
acknowledge, 
however, 
that 
in 
this 
state 
of 
confusion, 
the 
soul 
would 
be 
without 
pleasure 
and 
without 
pain, 
for 
these 
are 
noticeable 
perceptions. 


§ 
12. 
[If 
a 
sleeping 
man 
thinks 
without 
knowing 
it, 
the 
sleeping 
and 
waking 
man 
are 
two 
persons.] 
I, 
in 
turn, 
will 
make 
you 
another 
supposition, 
which 
appears 
more 
natural. 
Is 
it 
not 
true 
that 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
after 
some 
interval 
or 
some 
great 
change, 
one 
may 
fall 
into 
a 
condition 
of 
general 
forgetfulness?Sleidan, 
itissaid, 
beforehis 
death, 
forgot 
allthathe 
knew; 
and 



there 
are 
numbers 
of 
other 
examples 
of 
this 
sad 
occurrence. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
that 
such 
a 
man 
became 
young 
again 
and 
learned 
all 
de 
novo. 
Would 
he 
be 
another 
man 
for 
all 
that? 
It 
is 
not 
then 
memory 
which 
properly 
makes 
the 
same 
man; 
nevertheless, 
the 
fiction 
of 
a 
soul 
which 
animates 
different 
bodies 
by 
turns 
without 
what 
happens 
to 
it 
in 
one 
of 
these 
bodies 
interesting 
it 
in 
the 
other, 
is 
one 
of 
those 
fictions 
contrary 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
which 
come 
fromtheincompletenotions 
ofthephilosophers,like 
spacewithoutbody,and 
body 
without 
motion, 
and 
which 
disappear 
when 
one 
penetrates 
a 
little 
farther; 
for 
it 
must 
be 
known 
that 
each 
soul 
preserves 
all 
its 
preceding 
impressions 
and 
cannot 
divide 
itself 
equally 
in 
the 
way 
just 
mentioned. 
The 
future 
in 
each 
substance 
has 
a 
perfect 
connection 
with 
the 
past. 
It 
is 
this 
which 
constitutes, 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
individual. 
Moreover, 
memory 
is 
not 
necessary 
nor 
even 
always 
possible, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
multitude 
of 
present 
and 
past 
impressions 
which 
cooperate 
toward 
our 
present 
thoughts 
for 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
there 
are 
in 
man 
thoughts 
of 
which 
there 
is 
not 
some 
effect 
at 
least 
confused, 
or 
some 
remnant 
mixed 
with 
subsequent 
thoughts. 
Many 
things 
can 
be 
forgotten, 
but 
they 
could 
also 
be 
remembered 
long 
afterward 
if 
theywererecalledasthey 
shouldbe. 


§ 
13. 
[Impossible 
to 
convince 
those 
that 
sleep 
without 
dreaming, 
that 
they 
think.] 
One 
is 
not 
without 
some 
feeble 
feeling 
while 
asleep, 
even 
when 
the 
sleep 
is 
dreamless. 
Waking 
itself 
shows 
it, 
and 
the 
easier 
it 
is 
to 
awaken 
one, 
the 
more 
feeling 
one 
has 
of 
what 
is 
going 
on 
without 
him, 
although 
this 
feelingis 
not 
alwayssufficientlystrong 
tocausetheawakening. 


§ 
15. 
[Upon 
this 
hypothesis, 
the 
thoughts 
of 
a 
sleeping 
man, 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
most 
rational.] 
Allimpressionshavetheireffect,butalltheeffectsarenot 
always 
noticeable. 
When 
I 
turn 
to 
one 
side 
rather 
than 
to 
another, 
it 
is 
very 
often 
through 
a 
series 
of 
minute 
impressions 
of 
which 
I 
am 
not 
conscious, 
and 
which 
render 
one 
movement 
a 
little 
more 
uncomfortable 
than 
the 
other. 



All 
our 
unpremeditated 
actions 
are 
the 
results 
of 
a 
cooperation 
of 
minute 
perceptions, 
and 
even 
our 
customs 
and 
passions, 
which 
have 
such 
influence 
in 
our 
deliberations, 
come 
therefrom; 
for 
these 
habits 
grow 
little 
by 
little, 
and 
consequently 
without 
the 
minute 
perceptions, 
we 
should 
not 
arrive 
at 
these 
noticeable 
dispositions. 
I 
have 
already 
remarked 
that 
he 
who 
would 
deny 
these 
effects 
in 
morals, 
would 
imitate 
the 
poorly 
instructed 
persons 
who 
deny 
insensible 
corpuscles 
in 
physics; 
and 
yet 
I 
see 
that 
there 
are 
among 
those 
who 
speak 
of 
liberty 
those 
who, 
taking 
no 
notice 
of 
these 
insensible 
impressions, 
capable 
of 
inclining 
the 
balance, 
imagine 
an 
entire 
indifference 
in 
moral 
actions, 
like 
that 
of 
the 
ass 
of 
Buridan 
divided 
equally 
between 
two 
meadows. 
And 
of 
this 
we 
shall 
speak 
more 
fully 
in 
what 
follows. 
I

§ 
23. 
[When 
does 
a 
man 
begin 
to 
have 
ideas?] 
I 
am 
of 
the 
same 
opinion 
[namely, 
that 
it 
is 
when 
he 
has 
some 
sensation]; 
but 
it 
is 
by 
a 
principle 
a 
little 
peculiar, 
for 
I 
believe 
that 
we 
are 
never 
without 
thoughts 
and 
also 
never 
without 
sensation. 
I 
distinguish 
only 
between 
ideas 
and 
thoughts; 
for 
we 
have 
always 
all 
pure 
or 
distinct 
ideas 
independently 
of 
the 
senses; 
but 
thoughts 
alwayscorrespond 
tosomesensation. 


§ 
25. 
[In 
the 
perception 
of 
simple 
ideas 
the 
soul 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
passive.] 
How 
can 
it 
be 
that 
it 
is 
merely 
passive 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
perception 
of 
all 
simple 
ideas, 
since, 
according 
to 
your 
own 
avowal, 
there 
are 
simple 
ideas 
the 
perception 
of 
which 
comes 
from 
reflection, 
and 
since 
the 
mind 
gives 
itself 
thoughts 
from 
reflection, 
for 
it 
is 
itself 
which 
reflects? 
Whether 
it 
can 
refuse 
them 
is 
another 
question, 
and 
it 
cannot 
do 
it 
undoubtedly 
without 
some 
reason 
which 
turns 
it 
aside 
from 
them, 
when 
there 
is 
some 
occasion 
for 
it.

Of 
solidity. 



§ 
1. 
[We 
receive 
this 
idea 
from 
touch.] 
And 
at 
bottom 
solidity, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
notion 
is 
distinct, 
is 
conceived 
by 
the 
pure 
reason,

CHAPTER 
V. 


Of 
simple 
ideas 
of 
divers 
senses. 



THESE 
IDEAS 
WHICH 
are 
said 
to 
come 
from 
more 
than 
one 
sense, 
as 
those 
ofspace,figure,motion, 
rest, 
aregivenus 
ratherbythecommonsense,thatis 
to 
say, 
the 
mind 
itself, 
for 
these 
are 
ideas 
of 
the 
pure 
understanding, 
but 
which 
have 
relation 
to 
that 
which 
is 
exterior 
and 
which 
the 
senses 
make 
us 
perceive;also 
theyarecapable 
ofdefinitions 
anddemonstrations. 



CHAPTER 
VII. 


Of 
ideas 
which 
come 
from 
sensation 
and 
from 
reflection. 



§1. 
[PLEASURE 
AND 
pain, 
power, 
existence, 
etc.] 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
senses 
could 
not 
convince 
us 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
sensible 
things 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
reason. 
Thus 
I 
believe 
the 
consideration 
of 
existence 
comes 
from 
reflection. 
Those 
of 
power 
and 
of 
unity 
come 
also 
from 
the 
same 
source 
and 
are 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
nature 
from 
the 
perceptions 
of 
pleasure 
and 
of 
pain. 



CHAPTER 
VIII. 


Other 
considerations 
concerning 
simple 
ideas. 



§ 
[PRIVATIVE 
QUALITIES.] 
I 
had 
not 
believed 
that 
the 
privative 
nature 
of 
repose 
could 
be 
doubted. 
It 
suffices 
for 
it 
that 
motion 
in 
body 
be 
denied; 
but 
it 
does 
not 
suffice 
for 
motion 
that 
repose 
be 
denied, 
and 
something 
more 
must 
be 
added 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
the 
degree 
of 
motion, 
since 
it 
receives 
essentially 
more 
or 
less, 
while 
all 
repose 
is 
equal. 
It 
is 
another 
thing 
when 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
repose, 
which 
must 
be 
positive 
in 
secondary 
matter 
or 
mass. 
I 
should 
further 
believe 
that 
the 
very 
idea 
of 
repose 
is 
privative, 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
consists 
only 
in 
negation. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
act 
of 
denying 
is 
a 
positive 
thing. 


§ 
10. 
[Secondary 
qualities.] 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
power, 
when 
it 
is 
intelligible 
and 
can 
be 
distinctly 
explained, 
ought 
to 
be 
counted 
among 
primary 
qualities; 
but 
when 
it 
is 
only 
sensible 
and 
gives 
but 
a 
confused 
idea, 
it 
ought 
tobeputamong 
secondary 
qualities. 



CHAPTER 
IX. 


Of 
perception. 



§ 
1. 
[PERCEPTION 
the 
first 
simple 
idea 
of 
reflection.] 
It 
might, 
perhaps, 
be 
added 
that 
brutes 
have 
perception 
and 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
they 
have 
thought, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
they 
have 
reflection 
or 
what 
may 
be 
its 
object. 
Also 
we 
ourselves 
have 
minute 
perceptions 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
inour 
presentstate. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
wecould 
verywellperceive 
them 
and 
reflect 
on 
them 
if 
we 
were 
not 
turned 
aside 
by 
their 
multitude 
which 
distracts 
our 
minds, 
or 
if 
they 
were 
not 
effaced 
or 
rather 
obscured 
by 
the 
greaterones. 


§ 
4. 
I 
should 
prefer 
to 
distinguish 
between 
perception 
and 
consciousness 
(s’apercevoir). 
The 
perception 
of 
light 
or 
of 
color, 
for 
example, 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious 
is 
composed 
of 
many 
minute 
perceptions 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious; 
and 
a 
noise 
of 
which 
we 
have 
a 
perception 
but 
to 
which 
we 
do 
not 
attend, 
becomes 
apperceptible 
by 
a 
little 
addition 
or 
augmentation. 
For 
if 
what 
precedesmade 
no 
impression 
on 
the 
soul, 
this 
small 
addition 
would 
also 
makenoneandthe 
wholewouldmakenomore. 


§ 
8. 
[“The 
problem 
of 
Molineux.”] 
I 
think 
that 
supposing 
that 
the 
blind 
man 
knows 
that 
these 
two 
figures 
which 
he 
sees 
are 
those 
of 
the 
cube 
and 
of 
the 
globe, 
he 
would 
be 
able 
to 
discern 
them 
and 
to 
say 
without 
touching 
them,thisis 
theglobe, 
thisisthecube. 


Perhaps 
Molineux 
and 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Essay 
are 
not 
so 
far 
from 
my 
opinion 
as 
at 
first 
appears, 
and 
that 
the 
reasons 
of 
their 
opinion, 
contained 
apparently 
in 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
former 
who 
has 
employed 
it 
with 
success 
in 
order 
to 
convince 
people 
of 
their 
folly, 
have 
been 
suppressed 
purposely 
by 



the 
latter 
in 
order 
to 
give 
more 
exercise 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
his 
readers. 
If 
you 
will 
weigh 
my 
answer 
you 
will 
find 
that 
I 
have 
put 
a 
condition 
in 
it 
which 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
comprised 
in 
the 
question; 
it 
is, 
that 
the 
only 
thing 
in 
question 
is 
that 
of 
distinguishing, 
and 
that 
the 
blind 
man 
knows 
that 
the 
two 
figured 
bodies 
which 
he 
must 
distinguish 
are 
there, 
and 
that 
thus 
each 
of 
the 
appearanceswhichhe 
sees 
is 
that 
ofthe 
cubeor 
that 
of 
the 
globe. 
In 
thiscase, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
beyond 
doubt 
that 
the 
blind 
man 
who 
ceases 
to 
be 
blind, 
can 
distinguish 
them 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
reason 
joined 
to 
what 
touch 
has 
provided 
him 
with 
beforehand 
of 
sensible 
knowledge. 
For 
I 
do 
not 
speak 
of 
what 
he 
will 
do 
perhaps 
in 
fact 
and 
immediately, 
being 
stunned 
and 
confounded 
by 
the 
novelty 
and 
otherwise 
little 
accustomed 
to 
drawing 
consequences. 
The 
foundation 
of 
my 
opinion 
is 
that 
in 
the 
globe 
there 
are 
no 
points 
distinguishable 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
globe 
itself, 
all 
being 
there 
level 
and 
without 
angles, 
whereas 
in 
the 
cube 
there 
are 
eight 
points 
distinguished 
from 
all 
the 
others. 
If 
there 
were 
not 
this 
means 
of 
distinguishing 
the 
figures 
a 
blind 
man 
could 
not 
learn 
the 
rudiments 
of 
geometry 
by 
touch. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
see 
that 
those 
born 
blind 
are 
capable 
of 
learning 
geometry 
and 
have 
even 
always 
some 
rudiments 
of 
natural 
geometry, 
and 
that 
most 
often 
geometry 
is 
learned 
by 
the 
sight 
alone, 
without 
employing 
touch, 
as 
a 
paralytic, 
or 
other 
person 
to 
whom 
touch 
has 
been 
almost 
interdicted, 
might 
and 
even 
must 
do. 
Anditmustbe 
thatthesetwo 
geometries,thatoftheblindman 
andthatofthe 
paralytic, 
meet 
and 
coincide 
and 
even 
return 
to 
the 
same 
ideas 
although 
there 
are 
no 
common 
images. 
This 
again 
shows 
how 
necessary 
it 
is 
to 
distinguish 
images 
from 
exact 
ideas 
which 
consist 
in 
definitions. 
It 
would 
certainly 
be 
very 
interesting 
and 
even 
instructive 
to 
examine 
well 
the 
ideas 
of 
one 
born 
blind 
to 
hear 
his 
descriptions 
of 
figures. 
For 
he 
might 
come 
to 
this 
and 
he 
might 
even 
understand 
the 
doctrine 
of 
optics 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
depends 
upon 
distinct 
and 
mathematical 
ideas, 
although 
he 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
reach 
a 



conception 
of 
what 
is 
clear-confused, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
image 
of 
light 
and 
of 
colors. 
— 
It 
would 
also 
be 
very 
important 
to 
examine 
the 
ideas 
that 
a 
deaf 
and 
dumb 
man 
might 
have 
of 
non-figured 
things. 
— 
Men 
are 
very 
negligent 
innotgetting 
anexact 
knowledgeof 
theways 
ofthinking 
ofsuchpersons. 


§11[Perception 
puts 
the 
difference 
between 
animals 
and 
inferior 
beings.] 
I 
am 
inclined 
to 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
also 
among 
plants 
some 
perception 
and 
desire, 
because 
of 
the 
great 
analogy 
there 
is 
between 
plants 
and 
animals; 
and 
if 
there 
is 
a 
vegetable 
soul, 
as 
is 
the 
common 
opinion, 
it 
must 
have 
perception. 
However, 
I 
do 
not 
cease 
to 
ascribe 
to 
mechanism 
all 
that 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
plants 
and 
animals, 
except 
their 
first 
formation. 
Thus 
I 
agree 
that 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
plant 
called 
sensitive 
comes 
from 
the 
mechanism, 
and 
I 
do 
not 
approve 
of 
having 
recourse 
to 
the 
soul 
when 
the 
detailofthephenomenaof 
plantsandanimalsistobeexplained. 


§13. 
Very 
good; 
and 
I 
think 
almost 
as 
much 
could 
be 
said 
of 
plants. 
But 
as 
to 
man, 
his 
perceptions 
are 
accompanied 
by 
the 
power 
of 
reflection 
which 
passes 
to 
the 
act 
when 
there 
is 
occasion. 
But 
when 
he 
is 
reduced 
to 
a 
state 
in 
which 
he 
is 
like 
one 
in 
a 
lethargy 
and 
almost 
without 
feeling, 
reflection 
and 
consciousness 
cease 
and 
universal 
truths 
are 
not 
thought 
of. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
innate 
and 
acquired 
faculties 
and 
dispositions 
and 
even 
the 
impressions 
which 
are 
received 
in 
this 
state 
of 
confusion 
do 
not 
cease 
for 
that 
reason 
and 
are 
not 
effaced 
although 
they 
are 
forgotten; 
they 
will 
even 
have 
their 
turn 
in 
order 
to 
contribute 
some 
day 
toward 
some 
noticeable 
effect; 
for 
nothing 
is 
useless 
in 
nature; 
all 
confusion 
ought 
to 
develop 
itself, 
animals 
even, 
having 
passed 
through 
a 
condition 
of 
stupidity, 
ought 
to 
return 
some 
day 
to 
more 
exalted 
perceptions; 
and 
since 
simple 
substances 
last 
forever, 
it 
will 
not 
do 
to 
judgeofeternitybysomeyears. 



CHAPTER 
XI. 


Of 
the 
faculty 
of 
discerning 
ideas. 



§ 
10. 
[BRUTES 
abstract 
not.] 
I 
am 
of 
the 
same 
opinion. 
They 
know 
apparently 
whiteness 
and 
notice 
it 
in 
chalk 
as 
in 
snow; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
yet 
abstraction, 
for 
it 
requires 
a 
consideration 
of 
what 
is 
common, 
separated 
from 
what 
is 
particular, 
and 
consequently 
there 
enters 
therein 
the 
knowledge 
of 
universal 
truths, 
which 
is 
not 
given 
to 
brutes. 
It 
is 
well 
observed 
also 
that 
the 
brutes 
that 
speak 
do 
not 
make 
use 
of 
words 
to 
express 
general 
ideas, 
and 
that 
men 
deprived 
of 
the 
use 
of 
speech 
and 
of 
words 
do 
not 
fail 
to 
invent 
other 
generalsigns. 


§ 
11. 
The 
brutes 
pass 
from 
one 
imagination 
to 
another 
by 
the 
connection 
which 
they 
have 
felt 
here 
before; 
for 
example, 
when 
the 
master 
takes 
a 
stick 
the 
dog 
is 
apprehensive 
of 
being 
struck. 
And 
on 
many 
occasions 
children, 
as 
likewise 
other 
men, 
have 
no 
other 
procedure 
in 
passages 
from 
thought 
to 
thought. 
This 
might 
be 
called 
consecution 
and 
reasoning 
in 
a 
very 
broad 
sense. 
But 
I 
prefer 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
received 
usage 
in 
confining 
these 
words 
to 
man 
and 
in 
restricting 
them 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
some 
reason 
of 
the 
connection 
of 
perceptions 
which 
sensations 
alone 
could 
not 
give 
their 
effect 
being 
but 
to 
cause 
us 
naturally 
to 
expect 
another 
time 
the 
same 
connection 
which 
hasbeen 
noticed 
before, 
although 
the 
reasons 
are 
no 
longer 
the 
same; 
a 
factwhichoftendeceivesthose 
whogovernthemselves 
merelybythesenses. 


§

[Dark 
room.] 
[Cf. 
opening 
remarks 
of 
the 
next 
chapter.] 



CHAPTER 
XII. 


Of 
complex 
ideas. 



IN 
ORDER 
TO 
render 
the 
resemblance 
greater 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
that 
there 
was 
in 
the 
dark 
room 
to 
receive 
the 
species 
a 
cloth, 
which 
was 
not 
smooth 
but 
diversified 
by 
folds 
representing 
innate 
knowledge; 
that, 
furthermore, 
this 
cloth 
or 
canvas 
being 
stretched 
had 
a 
sort 
of 
elasticity 
or 
power 
of 
acting, 
and 
even 
an 
action 
or 
reaction 
accommodated 
as 
much 
to 
past 
folds 
as 
to 
newly 
arrived 
impressions 
of 
the 
species. 
And 
this 
action 
would 
consist 
in 
certain 
vibrations 
or 
oscillations, 
such 
as 
are 
seen 
in 
a 
stretched 
cord 
when 
it 
is 
touched, 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
that 
it 
gives 
forth 
a 
sort 
of 
musical 
sound. 
For 
not 
only 
do 
we 
receive 
images 
or 
traces 
in 
the 
brain 
but 
we 
also 
form 
them 
anew 
when 
we 
consider 
complex 
ideas. 
Thus 
the 
cloth, 
which 
represents 
our 
brain, 
must 
be 
active 
and 
elastic. 
This 
comparison 
would 
explain 
tolerably 
well 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
brain; 
but 
as 
to 
the 
soul, 
which 
is 
a 
simple 
substance 
or 
monad, 
it 
represents 
without 
extension 
these

3. 
[Complex 
ideas 
are 
either 
modes, 
substances, 
or 
relations.] 


This 
division 
of 
the 
objects 
of 
our 
thoughts 
into 
substances, 
modes 
and 
relations 
is 
satisfactory 
to 
me. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
qualities 
are 
but 
modifications 
of 
substances, 
and 
that 
the 
understanding 
adds 
thereto 
the 
relations. 
Thisis 
ofmoreconsequence 
thanis 
thought. 


§ 
5. 
[Simple 
and 
mixed 
modes.] 
Perhaps 
a 
dozen 
or 
score 
are 
but 
relations 
and 
are 
constituted 
by 
relation 
to 
the 
understanding. 
Units 
are 
separate 
and 
the 
understanding 
puts 
them 
together 
however 
dispersed 
they 
may 
be. 
Nevertheless, 
although 
relations 
are 
from 
the 
understanding 
they 
are 
not 



without 
foundation 
and 
reality. 
For 
the 
first 
Understanding 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
things; 
and 
even 
the 
reality 
of 
all 
things, 
except 
simple 
substances, 
consists 
only 
in 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
simple 
substances. 
It 
is 
often 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
regards 
mixed 
modes, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that

CHAPTER 
XIII. 


Of 
simple 
modes, 
and 
first 
of 
those 
of 
space. 



§ 
17. 
[WHETHER 
space 
is 
substance 
or 
accident, 
not 
known.] 
I 
have 
reason 
to 
fear 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
accused 
of 
vanity 
in 
wishing 
to 
determine 
what 
you, 
sir, 
acknowledge 
not 
to 
know. 
But 
there 
is 
room 
for 
believing 
that 
you 
know 
more 
on 
this 
point 
than 
you 
say 
or 
believe 
you 
do. 
Some 
have 
believed 
that 
God 
is 
the 
place 
of 
things. 
Lessius 
and 
Guerike, 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
were 
of 
this 
opinion; 
but 
then 
place 
contains 
something 
more 
than 
we 
attribute 
to 
space 
which 
we 
strip 
of 
all 
action; 
and 
in 
this 
way 
it 
is 
no 
more 
a 
substance 
than 
time, 
and 
if 
it 
has 
parts 
it 
could 
not 
be 
God. 
It 
is 
a 
relation, 
an 
order, 
not 
only 
among 
existing 
things 
but 
also 
among 
possible 
things 
as 
if 
they 
existed. 
But 
its 
truth 
and 
reality 
is 
founded 
in 
God, 
like 
all 
the 
eternal 
truths.

§ 
19. 
[Substance 
and 
accident 
of 
little 
use 
in 
philosophy.] 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
I 
am 
of 
another 
opinion, 
and 
that 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
consideration 
of 
substance 
is 
a 
point 
of 
philosophy 
of 
the 
greatest 
importance 
and 
of 
the 
greatestfruitfulness. 



CHAPTER 
XIV. 


Of 
duration 
and 
its 
simple 
modes. 



§ 
16. 
[IT 
is 
not 
motion 
but 
the 
constant 
train 
of 
ideas 
in 
our 
minds 
while 
awake 
that 
furnishes 
us 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
duration.] 
A 
train 
of 
perceptions 
awakens 
in 
us 
the 
idea 
of 
duration 
but 
it 
does 
not 
make 
it. 
Our 
perceptions 
never 
have 
a 
train 
sufficiently 
constant 
and 
regular 
to 
correspond 
to 
that 
of 
time, 
which 
is 
a 
uniform 
and 
simple 
continuum, 
like 
a 
straight 
line. 
The 
change 
of 
perceptions 
gives 
us 
occasion 
to 
think 
of 
time, 
and 
it 
is 
measured 
by 
uniform 
changes; 
but 
if 
there 
should 
be 
nothing 
uniform 
in 
nature, 
time 
would 
not 
cease 
to 
be 
determined, 
just 
as 
place

not

to 
be

Thevoidwhichcanbe

likethatinspace,

§ 
26. 
Time 
and 
space 
are 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
eternal 
truths 
which 
concern 
equallythepossibleandtheexisting. 


§ 
27. 
[Eternity.] 
But 
in 
order 
to 
derive 
the 
notion 
of 
eternity 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
conceive 
more, 
viz. 
that 
the 
same 
reason 
subsists 
always 
for 
going 
farther. 
It 
is 
this 
consideration 
of 
the 
reasons 
which 
completes 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
infinite 
or 
of 
the 
indefinite 
in 
progresses. 
Thus 
the 
senses 
alone 
could 
not 
suffice 
to 
make 
us 
form 
these 
notions. 
And 
at 
bottom 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
Absolute 
is 
anterior 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
to 
that 
of 
the 
limits 
which 
areadded. 
But 
we 
do 
not 
notice

what

CHAPTER 
XVII. 


Of 
infinity. 



§ 
1. 
[INFINITY, 
initsoriginalintention,attributedtospace,durationand 
number.] 
The 
true 
infinite, 
strictly 
speaking, 
is 
only 
in 
the 
Absolute, 
which 
is 
anterior 
toallcompositionandisnotformedby 
the 
additionof 
parts. 


§ 
3. 
[Hence 
we 
come 
by 
the 
idea 
of 
infinity.] 
Take 
a 
straight 
line 
and 
prolong 
it 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
is 
double 
the 
first. 
Now 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
second, 
being 
perfectly 
similar 
to 
the 
first, 
can 
be 
doubled 
in 
the 
same 
way 
in 
order 
to 
give 
a 
third 
which 
is 
also 
similar 
to 
the 
preceding; 
and 
the 
same 
reason 
subsisting 
always 
it 
will 
never 
be 
possible 
to 
stop; 
thus 
the 
line 
can 
be 
prolonged 
ad 
infinitum; 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
infinite 
comes 
from 
that 
of 
the 
similarity 
or 
of 
the 
same 
reason, 
and 
its 
origin 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
universal 
and 
necessary 
truths. 
This 
shows 
how 
what 
gives 
completion 
to 
the 
conception 
of 
this 
idea 
is 
found 
in 
us 
and 
could 
not 
come 
from 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
senses; 
just 
as 
necessary 
truths 
could 
not 
be 
proved 
by 
induction 
nor 
by 
the 
senses. 
The 
idea 
of 
the 
Absolute 
is 
in 
us 
internally, 
like 
that 
of 
being. 
These 
absolutes 
are 
nothing 
but 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
and 
it 
can 
besaidthatthey 
are 
no 
less 
the 
source 
ofthe 
ideas 
than 
Godis 
himself 
the 
principle 
of 
beings. 
The 
idea 
of 
the 
absolute 
in 
relation 
to 
space 
is 
no 
other 
than 
that 
of 
the 
immensity 
of 
God, 
and 
so 
of 
the 
others. 
But 
we 
deceive 
ourselves 
in 
imagining 
an 
absolute 
space, 
which 
would 
be 
an 
infinite 
whole, 
composed 
of 
parts. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing. 
It 
is 
a 
notion 
which 
involves 
a 
contradiction, 
and 
these 
infinite 
wholes 
and 
their 
opposites, 
the 
infinitely 
minutes, 
are 
only 
admissible 
in 
the 
calculations 
of 
geometers 
just 
like 
theimaginaryrootsofalgebra. 



§ 
16. 
[We 
home 
no 
positive 
idea, 
of 
infinity 
nor 
of 
infinite 
duration] 
I 
believe 
that 
we 
have 
a 
positive 
idea 
of 
both, 
and 
this 
idea 
will 
be 
true 
provided 
it 
is 
not 
conceived 
as 
an 
infinite 
whole 
but 
as 
an 
absolute 
or 
attribute 
without 
limits, 
which 
is 
the 
case 
as 
regards 
the 
eternity 
in 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
without 
depending 
on 
parts 
and 
without 
forming 
the 
notion 
by 
an 
addition 
of 
times. 
From 
this 
is 
also 
seen, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
that 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
infinite 
comes 
from 
the 
same 
sourceasthatof 
necessary 
truths. 



CHAPTER 
XIX. 


Of 
the 
modes 
of 
thinking. 



§ 
1. 
[SENSATION, 
remembrance, 
contemplation, 
&c.] 
It 
is 
well 
to 
clear 
up 
these 
notions 
and 
I 
shall 
try 
to 
aid 
in 
it. 
I 
will 
say 
then 
that 
it 
is 
sensation 
when 
we 
perceive 
an 
external 
object; 
that 
remembrance 
is 
its 
repetition 
without 
the 
object 
returning; 
but 
when 
we 
know 
that 
we 
have 
had 
it, 
it 
is 
memory. 
Contemplation 
is 
commonly 
employed 
in 
a 
sense 
different 
from 
yours, 
namely, 
for 
a 
condition 
where 
we 
free 
ourselves 
from 
business 
in 
order 
to 
apply 
ourselves 
to 
some 
meditation. 
But 
since 
there 
is 
no 
word 
that 
I 
know 
of 
which 
fits 
your 
notion, 
sir, 
the 
one 
you 
employ 
may 
be 
applied 
to 
it. 
We 
give 
attention 
to 
the 
objects 
which 
we 
distinguish 
and 
prefer 
to 
others. 
When 
attention 
continues 
in 
the 
mind, 
whether 
the 
external 
object 
continues 
or 
not, 
and 
even 
whether 
it 
is 
present 
or 
not, 
this 
is 
consideration; 
which 
when 
it 
concerns 
knowledge 
without 
reference 
to 
action 
will 
be 
contemplation. 
Attention, 
the 
aim 
of 
which 
is 
to 
learn 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
acquire 
knowledge 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
it), 
is 
study. 
To 
consider 
in 
order 
to 
form 
some 
plan 
is 
to 
meditate; 
but 
revery 
appears 
to 
be 
nothing 
but 
the 
pursuing 
of 
certain 
thoughts 
through 
the 
pleasure 
taken 
in 
them 
without 
having 
other 
end; 
this 
is 
why 
revery 
may 
lead 
to 
insanity: 
one 
forgets 
self, 
forgets 
the 
dic 
cur 
hic, 
approaches 
dreams 
and 
chimeras, 
builds 
castles 
in 
Spain. 
Wecannotdistinguish 
dreams 
fromsensationsexceptbecausethey 
are 
not 
connected 
with 
them; 
they 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
world 
apart. 
Sleep 
is 
a 
cessation 
of 
sensations, 
and 
so 
trance 
is 
a 
very 
profound 
sleep 
from 
which 
one 
can 
be 
aroused 
with 
difficulty, 
which 
comes 
from 
a 
transient 
internal 
cause 
which 
distinguishes 
it 
from 
the 
profound 
sleep 
which 
comes 
from 
a 



narcotic 
or 
from 
some 
lasting 
injury 
to 
the 
functions, 
as 
in 
lethargy. 
Trances 
are 
sometimes 
accompanied 
by 
visions; 
but 
there 
are 
some 
without 
trance; 
and 
vision, 
it 
seems, 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
dream 
which 
passes 
for 
a 
sensation, 
as 
if 
it 
taught 
us 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
objects. 
And 
when 
these 
visions 
are 
divine 
there 
is 
in 
fact 
truth; 
which 
may 
be 
known, 
for 
example, 
when 
they 
contain 
particularizedprophecies 
whichtheeventjustifies. 


§ 
4. 
[Hence 
it 
is 
probable 
that 
thinking 
is 
the 
action, 
not 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
soul.] 
Undoubtedly 
thought 
is 
an 
action 
and 
could 
not 
be 
the 
essence; 
but 
it 
is 
an 
essential 
action, 
and 
all 
substances 
havesuch. 
I 
have 
shown 
above, 
that 
we 
have 
always 
an 
infinity 
of 
minute 
perceptions 
without 
our 
being 
conscious 
of 
them. 
We 
are 
never 
without 
perceptions 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
we 
be 
often 
without 
apperceptions, 
namely, 
when 
there 
are 
no 
distinct 
perceptions. 
It 
is 
for 
want 
of 
having 
considered 
this 
important 
point 
that 
a 
philosophy 
loose 
and 
as 
little 
noble 
as 
solid 
has 
prevailed 
among 
so 
many 
men 
of 
good 
minds, 
and 
because 
we 
have 
hitherto 
almost 
ignored 
what 
there 
is 
most 
beautiful 
in 
souls. 
This 
has 
also 
caused 
men 
to 
find 
so 
much 
plausibility 
in 
the 
error 
which 
teaches 
thatsoulsareofaperishablenature. 



CHAPTERXX. 


Of 
modes 
of 
pleasure 
and 
pain. 



§ 
1. 
[PLEASURE 
and 
pain, 
simple 
ideas.] 
I 
believe 
that 
there 
are 
no 
perceptions 
which 
are 
entirely 
indifferent 
to 
us, 
but 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
their 
effect 
be 
not 
noticeable 
in 
order 
that 
they 
may 
be 
called 
so, 
for 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
appear 
to 
consist 
in 
an 
aid 
or 
in 
a 
noticeable 
impediment. 
I 
assert 
that 
this 
definition 
isnotnominaland 
thatonecannotbegiven. 


§ 
2. 
[Good 
and 
evil, 
what.] 
I 
am 
also 
of 
this 
opinion. 
The 
good 
is 
divided 
into 
the 
praiseworthy, 
agreeable, 
and 
useful; 
but 
at 
bottom 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
must 
be 
either 
itself 
agreeable 
or 
contributing 
to 
something 
else 
which 
can 
give 
us 
anagreeable 
feeling; 
that 
is 
tosay, 
thegood 
is 
agreeableor 
useful 
and 
thepraiseworthyitselfconsistsina 
pleasureofthemind. 


§§ 
4, 
5. 
[Love. 
Hatred.] 
I 
gave 
very 
nearly 
this 
same 
definition 
of 
love 
when 
I 
explained 
the 
principles 
of 
justice 
in 
the 
preface 
to 
my 
Codex 
Juris 
Gentium 
Diplomaticus, 
namely, 
thatto 
love 
is 
to 
be 
led 
to 
take 
pleasure 
in 
the 
perfection, 
well-being 
or 
happiness 
of 
the 
beloved 
object. 
And 
for 
this 
reason 
we 
do 
not 
consider 
nor 
demand 
any 
other 
pleasure 
for 
self 
than 
just 
that 
which 
is 
found 
in 
the 
well-being 
or 
pleasure 
of 
the 
one 
loved; 
but 
in 
this 
sense 
we 
do 
not 
properly 
love 
what 
is 
incapable 
of 
pleasure 
or 
of 
happiness, 
and 
we 
enjoy 
things 
of 
this 
nature 
without, 
for 
that 
reason, 
loving 
them, 
if 
this 
is 
notby 
aprosopopoeia, 
and 
as 
if 
we 
imagine 
that 
they 
themselves 
enjoy 
their 
perfection. 
It 
is 
not 
then 
properly 
love 
when 
we 
say 
that 
we 
love 
a 
beautiful 
picture 
because 
of 
the 
pleasure 
we 
take 
in 
thinking 
of 
its 
perfections. 
But 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
extend 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
terms, 
and 
usagevaries 
here. 
Philosophers 
and 
theologians 
even 
distinguish 
two 
kinds 
of 



love, 
namely, 
the 
love 
which 
they 
call 
love 
of 
conquest, 
which 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
desire 
or 
feeling 
we 
have 
for 
what 
gives 
us 
pleasure 
without 
our 
interesting 
ourselves 
as 
to 
whether 
it 
receives 
pleasure; 
and 
the 
love 
of 
benevolence, 
which 
is 
the 
feeling 
we 
have 
for 
him 
who, 
by 
his 
pleasure 
or 
happiness, 
gives 
the 
same 
to 
us. 
The 
first 
causes 
us 
to 
have 
in 
view 
our 
pleasure 
and 
the 
second 
that 
of 
others, 
but 
as 
making 
or 
rather 
constituting 
ours, 
for 
if 
it 
should 
not 
react 
upon 
us 
in 
some 
sort 
we 
could 
not 
interest 
ourselves 
in 
it, 
since 
it 
is 
impossible, 
whatever 
may 
be 
said, 
to 
be 
indifferent 
to 
one’s 
own 
good. 
And 
this 
is 
how 
disinterested 
or 
nonmercenary 
love 
must 
be 
understood, 
in 
order 
to 
conceive 
well 
its 
nobleness 
and 
yet 
not 
to 
fall 
into 
thechimerical. 


§ 
6. 
[Desire]. 
This 
consideration 
of 
uneasiness 
is 
a 
capital 
point 
in 
which 
the 
author 
has 
particularly 
shown 
his 
penetrating 
and 
profound 
spirit. 
This 
is 
why 
I 
have 
given 
it 
some 
attention, 
and 
after 
having 
considered 
the 
matter 
well, 
it 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
the 
French 
word 
inquietude 
(restlessness), 
if 
it 
does 
not 
sufficiently 
express 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
author, 
fits 
nevertheless, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
thing; 
and 
the 
English 
word 
uneasiness, 
if 
it 
stands 
for 
a 
displeasure, 
fretfulness 
(chagrin), 
inconvenience, 
and 
in 
a 
word 
some 
effective 
pain, 
would 
be 
inappropriate. 
I 
should 
prefer 
to 
say 
that 
in 
desire 
in 
itself 
there 
is 
rather 
a 
disposition 
and 
preparation 
toward 
pain 
than 
pain 
itself. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
this 
perception 
sometimes 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
that 
which 
is 
in 
pain 
than 
as 
less 
does 
from 
more, 
but 
this 
is 
because 
the 
degree 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
pain, 
for 
it 
is 
a 
noticeable 
perception. 
This 
is 
also 
seen 
by 
the 
difference 
which 
there 
is 
between 
appetite 
and 
hunger; 
for 
when 
the 
irritation 
of 
the 
stomach 
becomes 
too 
strong 
it 
incommodes; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
to 
apply 
here 
our 
doctrine 
of 
perceptions 
too 
minute 
to 
be 
apperceptible; 
for 
if 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
us 
when 
we 
have 
an 
appetite 
and 
desire 
were 
sufficiently 
magnified 
it 
would 
cause 
us 
pain. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
infinitely 
wise 



author 
of 
our 
being 
has 
acted 
for 
our 
good, 
when 
he 
ordained 
that 
we 
should 
be 
often 
in 
ignorance 
and 
in 
confused 
perceptions. 
This 
is 
in 
order 
to 
act 
more 
promptly 
by 
instinct 
and 
not 
to 
be 
incommoded 
by 
the 
too 
distinct 
sensations 
of 
many 
objects, 
which 
do 
not 
altogether 
come 
back 
to 
us, 
and 
which 
nature 
has 
not 
been 
able 
to 
do 
without 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
its 
ends. 
How 
many 
insects 
do 
we 
not 
swallow 
without 
our 
being 
conscious 
of 
it? 
how 
many 
persons 
do 
we 
see 
who 
having 
too 
fine 
a 
sense 
of 
smell 
are 
thereby 
incommoded? 
and 
how 
many 
disgusting 
objects 
should 
we 
see 
if 
our 
vision 
were 
sufficiently 
piercing? 
It 
is 
also 
by 
this 
skill 
that 
nature 
has 
given 
us 
the 
incitements 
of 
desire, 
like 
the 
rudiments 
or 
elements 
of 
pain 
or, 
so 
to 
speak, 
semi-pains, 
or 
(if 
you 
wish 
to 
speak 
so 
as 
to 
express 
yourself 
more 
forcibly) 
minute 
inapperceptible 
pains, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
we 
may 
enjoy 
the 
advantage 
of 
evil 
without 
beingincommodedthereby. 
Forotherwiseif 
thisperceptionwere 
too 
distinct 
we 
would 
always 
be 
miserable 
in 
waiting 
for 
the 
good, 
whereas 
this 
continual 
victory 
over 
these 
semi-pains 
which 
are 
felt 
in 
following 
one’s 
desire 
and 
satisfying 
in 
some 
sort 
this 
appetite 
or 
this 
longing, 
gives 
us 
many 
semi-pleasures, 
the 
continuation 
and 
collection 
of 
which 
(as 
in 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
impulse 
of 
a 
heavy 
body 
which 
descends 
and 
acquires 
force) 
becomes 
in 
the 
end 
an 
entire 
and 
real 
pleasure. 
And 
at 
bottom 
without 
these 
semi-pains 
there 
would 
be 
no 
pleasure, 
and 
there 
would 
be 
no 
means 
of 
perceiving 
that 
something, 
by 
being 
an 
obstacle 
which 
prevents 
us 
from 
putting 
ourselves 
at 
our 
ease, 
assists 
us 
and 
aids 
us. 
It 
is 
also 
in 
this 
that 
the 
affinity 
of 
pain 
and 
of 
pleasure 
is 
recognized, 
which 
Socrates 
notices 
in 
the 
Phaedo 
of 
Plato 
when 
the 
feet 
long 
to 
be 
in 
action. 
This 
consideration 
of 
the 
minute 
aids 
or 
small 
deliverances 
and 
imperceptible 
disengagements 
of 
the 
arrested 
tendency 
from 
which 
noticeable 
pleasure 
finally 
results, 
serves 
also 
to 
give 
some 
more 
distinct 
knowledge 
of 
the 
confused 
idea 
which 
we 
have 
and 
ought 
to 
have 
of 
pleasure 
and 
of 
pain; 
just 
as 
the 
feeling 
of 
heat 
or 
of 



light 
results 
from 
many 
minute 
movements 
which 
express 
those 
of 
the 
objects, 
as 
I 
have 
said 
above 
(ch. 
9, 
§ 
13), 
and 
do 
not 
differ 
therefrom 
save 
in 
appearance 
and 
because 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
of 
this 
analysis; 
whereas 
many 
to-day 
believe 
that 
our 
ideas 
of 
sensible 
qualities 
differ 
toto 
genere 
from 
motions 
and 
from 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
objects, 
and 
are 
something 
primitive 
and 
inexplicable, 
and 
even 
arbitrary, 
as 
if 
God 
made 
the 
soul 
feel 
what 
seems 
good 
to 
him 
in 
place 
of 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
body; 
an 
opinion 
very 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
true 
analysis 
of 
our 
ideas. 
But 
to 
return 
to 
uneasiness, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
the 
minute 
imperceptible 
solicitations 
which 
keep 
us 
always 
in 
breath, 
these 
are 
confused 
determinations 
such 
that 
we 
often 
do 
not 
know 
what 
we 
lack, 
whereas 
in 
inclinations 
and 
passions, 
we 
at 
least 
know 
what 
we 
need, 
although 
the 
confused 
perceptions 
enter 
also 
into 
their 
manner 
of 
acting, 
and 
the 
same 
passions 
also 
cause 
this 
uneasiness 
or 
longing. 
These 
impulses 
are 
like 
so 
many 
small 
springs 
which 
try 
to 
unbend 
and 
which 
cause 
our 
machine 
to 
act. 
And 
I 
have 
already 
remarked 
thereon, 
that 
it 
is 
through 
this 
that 
we 
are 
never 
indifferent, 
when 
we 
appear 
to 
be 
most 
so, 
for 
example, 
to 
turning 
to 
the 
right 
rather 
than 
to 
the 
left 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a 
path. 
For 
the 
side 
which 
we 
take 
comes 
from 
these 
insensible 
determinations 
mingled 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
objects 
and 
of 
the 
interior 
of 
the 
body, 
which 
cause 
us 
to 
find 
ourselves 
more 
at 
our 
ease 
in 
one 
than 
in 
the 
other 
way 
of 
moving 
ourselves. 
The 
pendulum 
of 
a 
clock 
is 
called 
in 
German 
Unruhe, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
uneasiness. 
It 
can 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
the 
same 
in 
our 
body 
which 
can 
never 
be 
perfectly 
at 
itseasebecauseifitshouldbe 
so, 
a 
new 
impression 
of 
the 
objects, 
a 
slight 
change 
in 
the 
organs, 
in 
the 
vessels, 
and 
in 
the 
viscera 
would 
change 
at 
once 
the 
balance 
and 
would 
cause 
them 
to 
make 
someslight 
effort 
in 
order 
to 
regain 
the 
best 
statewhichtheycanbe 
in; 
which 
produces 
a 
continual 
strife, 
which 
causes, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
uneasiness 
of 
our 
clock; 
sothatthistermissatisfactorytome. 



§7. 
[Joy]. 
There 
are 
no 
words 
in 
the 
languages 
sufficiently 
appropriate 
to 
distinguish 
kindred 
notions. 
Perhaps 
the 
Latin 
gaudium 
approaches 
nearer 
this 
definition 
of 
joy 
than 
laetitia, 
which 
is 
also 
translated 
by 
the 
word 
joy; 
but 
then 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
signify 
a 
state 
in 
which 
pleasure 
predominates 
in 
us, 
for 
during 
the 
profoundest 
sorrow 
and 
amidst 
the 
most 
piercing 
griefs 
one 
can 
take 
some 
pleasure, 
as 
in 
drinking 
or 
in 
listening 
to 
music, 
but 
the 
pain 
predominates; 
and 
likewise 
amid 
the 
sharpest 
pains, 
the 
mind 
can 
be 
in 
joy, 
ashappened 
tothemartyrs. 


§ 
8. 
[Sorrow.] 
Not 
only 
the 
actual 
presence 
but 
also 
the 
fear 
of 
an 
evil 
to 
come 
can 
make 
sad, 
so 
that 
I 
believe 
the 
definitions 
of 
joy 
and 
of 
sorrow, 
which 
I 
have 
just 
given, 
come 
nearest 
to 
usage. 
As 
to 
uneasiness, 
there 
is 
in 
pain, 
and 
consequently 
in 
sorrow, 
something 
more; 
and 
uneasiness 
is 
even 
in 
joy, 
for 
it 
makes 
men 
wide 
awake, 
active, 
full 
of 
hope 
for 
going 
farther. 
Joy 
has 
been 
able 
to 
cause 
death 
by 
excess 
of 
emotion, 
and 
then 
there 
was 
in 
it 
evenmorethan 
uneasiness. 


§§ 
9, 
10. 
[Hope 
and 
Fear.] 
If 
uneasiness 
signifies 
a 
pain, 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
it 
always 
accompanies 
fear; 
but 
taking 
it 
for 
this 
insensible 
incitement 
which 
urges 
us 
on, 
it 
can 
also 
be 
applied 
to 
hope. 
The 
Stoics 
took 
the 
passions 
for 
opinions; 
thus 
their 
hope 
was 
the 
opinion 
of 
a 
future 
good, 
and 
fear, 
the 
opinion 
of 
a 
future 
evil. 
But 
I 
prefer 
to 
say 
that 
the 
passions 
are 
neither 
contentments 
or 
pains, 
nor 
opinions, 
but 
tendencies 
or 
rather 
modifications 
of 
the 
tendency, 
which 
come 
from 
opinion 
or 
from 
feeling, 
and 
which 
areaccompaniedbypleasure 
ordispleasure. 


§ 
11. 
[Despair.] 
Despair 
taken 
for 
the 
passion 
will 
be 
a 
sort 
of 
strong 
tendency 
which 
finds 
itself 
wholly 
arrested, 
causing 
a 
violent 
struggle 
and 
much 
pain. 
But 
when 
the 
despair 
is 
accompanied 
by 
repose 
and 
indolence, 
it 
willbe 
anopinionrather 
thana 
passion. 



§ 
12. 
[Anger.] 
Anger 
seems 
to 
be 
something 
more 
simple 
and 
more 
general 
since 
brutes, 
to 
whom 
no 
injury 
has 
been 
done, 
are 
susceptible 
of 
it. 
There 
is 
in 
anger 
a 
violent 
effort 
which 
strives 
to 
free 
itself 
from 
evil. 
The 
desire 
of 
vengeance 
can 
remain 
when 
one 
is 
cool 
and 
when 
one 
experiences 
hatredratherthananger. 


§ 
13. 
[Envy.] 
According 
to 
this 
[Locke’s] 
notion, 
envy 
would 
be 
always 
a 
praiseworthy 
passion 
and 
always 
founded 
upon 
justice, 
at 
least 
in 
my 
opinion. 
But 
I 
do 
not 
know 
but 
that 
envy 
is 
often 
entertained 
toward 
recognized 
merit 
which 
one 
would 
not 
hesitate 
to 
misuse 
if 
one 
were 
master. 
Envy 
is 
even 
entertained 
of 
people 
who 
have 
a 
good 
which 
one 
would 
not 
care 
to 
have 
one’s 
self. 
One 
would 
be 
content 
to 
see 
them 
deprived 
of 
it 
without 
thinking 
to 
profit 
by 
their 
spoils, 
and 
even 
without 
being 
able 
to 
hope 
it. 
For 
some 
goods 
are 
like 
pictures 
painted 
in 
fresco 
which 
can 
be 
destroyed, 
butwhich 
cannotbetakenaway. 


§ 
11. 
[Shame.] 
If 
men 
took 
more 
pains 
to 
observe 
the 
exterior 
movements 
which 
accompany 
the 
passions, 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
conceal 
them. 
As 
to 
shame, 
it 
is 
worthy 
of 
consideration 
that 
modest 
persons, 
when 
they 
are 
simply 
witnesses 
of 
an 
improper 
action, 
sometimes 
feel 
movements 
resemblingthoseofshame. 



CHAPTER 
XXI. 


Of 
power 
and 
of 
liberty. 



§1. 
[THE 
IDEA 
of 
power, 
how 
got.] 
If 
power 
corresponds 
to 
the 
Latin 
potentia 
it 
is 
opposed 
to 
act, 
and 
the 
passage 
from 
power 
to 
act 
is 
change. 
This 
is 
what 
Aristotle 
understands 
by 
the 
word 
motion 
when 
he 
says 
that 
it 
is 
the 
act 
or 
perhaps 
the 
actuation 
of 
what 
is 
in 
power. 
We 
can 
say 
then 
that 
power 
in 
general 
is 
the 
possibility 
of 
change. 
Now 
change 
or 
the 
act 
of 
this 
possibility, 
being 
action 
in 
one 
subject 
and 
passion 
in 
another, 
there 
will 
be 
also 
two 
powers, 
one 
passive 
the 
other 
active. 
The 
active 
could 
be 
called 
faculty 
and 
perhaps 
the 
passive 
could 
be 
called 
capacity 
or 
receptivity. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
active 
power 
is 
sometimes 
taken 
in 
a 
more 
perfect 
sense 
when 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
simple 
faculty 
there 
is 
a 
tendency; 
and 
it 
is 
thus 
that 
I 
employ 
it 
inmy 
dynamical 
considerations. 
Theword 
force 
might 
be 
appropriated 
to 
it 
in 
particular; 
and 
force 
would 
be 
either 
entelechy 
or 
effort; 
for 
entelechy 
(although 
Aristotle 
employs 
it 
so 
generally 
that 
it 
comprises 
also 
all 
action 
and 
all 
effort) 
appears 
to 
me 
more 
appropriate 
to 
primitive 
acting 
forces, 
and 
that 
of 
effort 
to 
derivative 
forces. 
There 
is 
even 
also 
a 
species 
of 
passive 
power 
more 
particular 
and 
more 
endowed 
with 
reality; 
it 
is 
this 
which 
is 
in 
matter 
when 
there 
is’ 
not 
only 
mobility, 
which 
is 
the 
capacity 
or 
receptivity 
for 
motion, 
but 
also 
resistance, 
which 
embraces 
impenetrability 
and 
inertia. 
Entelechies, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
primitive 
or 
substantial 
tendencies, 
when 
they 
are 
accompaniedby 
perception, 
are 
souls. 


§ 
4. 
[The 
clearest 
idea 
of 
active 
power 
had 
from 
spirit.] 
I 
am 
thoroughly 
in 
accord 
with 
you, 
that 
the 
clearest 
idea 
of 
active 
power 
comes 
to 
us 
from 



spirit. 
It 
is 
also 
only 
in 
things 
which 
have 
an 
analogy 
with 
spirit, 
that 
is 
to 
say,in 
entelechies,formatterproperlyonlyindicates 
passive 
power. 


§ 
8. 
[Liberty.] 
The 
term 
liberty 
is 
very 
ambiguous. 
There 
is 
liberty 
of 
right 
and 
of 
fact. 
According 
to 
that 
of 
right 
a 
slave 
is 
not 
free, 
a 
subject 
is 
not 
entirely 
free, 
but 
a 
poor 
man 
is 
as 
free 
as 
a 
rich 
man. 
Liberty 
of 
foot 
consists 
either 
in 
the 
power 
to 
will 
as 
one 
ought, 
or 
in 
the 
power 
to 
do 
what 
one 
wills. 
It 
is 
of 
the 
liberty 
of 
doing 
of 
which 
you 
speak, 
and 
it 
has 
its 
degrees 
and 
varieties. 
Generally 
he 
who 
has 
most 
means 
is 
most 
free 
to 
do 
what 
he 
wishes:but, 
in 
particular, 
liberty 
is 
understood 
of 
the 
use 
of 
things 
which 
are 
wont 
to 
be 
in 
our 
power 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
free 
use 
of 
our 
body. 
Thus 
the 
prison 
or 
sicknesses 
which 
prevent 
us 
from 
giving 
to 
our 
body 
and 
to 
our 
limbs 
the 
motion 
which 
we 
wish 
and 
which 
we 
are 
ordinarily 
able 
to 
give, 
lessens 
our 
liberty. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
a 
prisoner 
is 
notfree, 
andthataparalytic 
has 
not 
the 
free 
use 
of 
his 
limbs. 
Liberty 
to 
will 
is 
also 
taken 
in 
two 
different 
senses. 
One 
is 
when 
it 
is 
opposed 
to 
the 
imperfection 
or 
to 
the 
slavery 
of 
the 
spirit, 
which 
is 
a 
coaction 
or 
constraint, 
but 
internal 
like 
that 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
passions. 
The 
other 
sense 
appears 
when 
liberty 
is 
opposed 
to 
necessity. 
In 
the 
first 
sense 
the 
Stoics 
said 
that 
the 
wise 
man 
only 
is 
free; 
and 
in 
fact 
the 
spirit 
is 
not 
free 
when 
it 
is 
occupied 
with 
a 
great 
passion, 
for 
one 
cannot 
then 
will 
as 
he 
ought 
to, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
with 
the 
deliberation 
which 
is 
requisite. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
God 
alone 
is 
perfectly 
free, 
and 
that 
created 
spirits 
are 
so 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
superior 
to 
the 
passions. 
And 
this 
liberty 
concerns 
properly 
our 
understanding. 
But 
the 
liberty 
of 
the 
spirit 
opposed 
to 
necessity 
concerns 
the 
naked 
will 
and 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
distinguished 
from 
the 
understanding. 
This 
it 
is 
which 
is 
called 
free-will, 
and 
it 
consists 
in 
this, 
that 
one 
wishes 
that 
the 
strongest 
reasons 
or 
impressions 
which 
the 
understanding 
presents 
to 
the 
will 
do 
not 
prevent 
the 
act 
of 
the 
will 
from 
being 
contingent, 
and 
do 
not 
give 
an 
absolute 
or 
so 
to 
say 
metaphysical 
necessity. 
And 
it 
is 
in 



this 
sense 
that 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
say 
that 
the 
understanding 
can 
determine 
thewillinaccordance 
with 
the 
prevalence 
of 
perceptions 
and 
reasons, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
even 
when 
it 
is 
certain 
and 
infallible 
it 
inclines 
without 
necessitating. 


§ 
13. 
[Necessity, 
what.] 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that, 
properly 
speaking, 
although 
volitions 
are 
contingent, 
necessity 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
opposed 
to 
volition 
but 
to 
contingency, 
and 
that 
necessity 
ought 
no 
to 
be 
confounded 
with 
determination, 
for 
there 
is 
not 
less 
of 
connection 
or 
of 
determination 
in 
thoughts 
than 
in 
motions 
(to 
be 
determined 
being 
quite 
different 
from 
being 
pushed 
or 
forced 
with 
constraint). 
And 
if 
we 
do 
not 
always 
notice 
the 
reason 
which 
determines 
us, 
or 
rather 
by 
which 
wedetermine 
ourselves, 
it 
is 
because 
we 
are 
as 
little 
capable 
of 
being 
conscious 
of 
the 
whole 
extent 
of 
our 
spirit 
and 
of 
its 
thoughts, 
most 
often 
imperceptible 
and 
confused, 
as 
we 
are 
of 
disentangling 
all 
the 
mechanisms 
which 
nature 
makes 
play 
in 
the 
body. 
Thus, 
if 
by 
necessity 
is 
understood 
the 
certain 
determination 
of 
man, 
which 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
all 
the 
circumstances 
of 
what 
takes 
place 
within 
and 
without 
the 
man 
could 
enable 
a 
perfect 
mind 
to 
foresee, 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
thoughts 
being 
just 
as 
determined 
as 
the 
motions 
which 
they 
represent, 
every 
free 
act 
would 
be 
necessary. 
But 
the 
necessary 
must 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
contingent 
though 
determined; 
and 
not 
only 
contingent 
truths 
are 
not 
necessary, 
but 
even 
their 
connections 
are 
not 
always 
of 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
for 
it 
must 
be 
acknowledged 
that 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
determination 
between 
the 
consequences 
which 
exist 
in 
necessary 
matter 
and 
those 
which 
exist 
in 
contingent 
matter. 
Geometrical 
and 
metaphysical 
consequences 
necessitate, 
but 
physical 
and 
moral 
incline 
without 
necessitating; 
the 
physical 
even 
having 
something 
moral 
and 
voluntary 
in 
relation 
to 
God, 
since 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
have 
no 
other 
necessity 
than 
that 
of 
[the 
principle 
of] 
the 
best. 
[Now 
God 
chooses 
freely 
although 
he 
is 



determined 
to 
choose 
the 
best; 
and 
as 
bodies 
themselves 
do 
not 
choose 
(God 
having 
chosen 
for 
them), 
usage 
has 
settled 
that 
they 
be 
called 
necessary 
agents; 
to 
which 
I 
am 
not 
opposed, 
provided 
the 
necessary 
and 
the 
determined 
be 
not 
confounded, 
and 
that 
it 
be 
not 
imagined 
that 
free 
beings 
act 
in 
an 
indetermined 
manner; 
an 
error 
which 
has 
prevailed 
in 
certain 
minds 
and 
which 
destroys 
the 
most 
important 
truths, 
even 
this 
fundamental 
axiom, 
that 
nothing 
occurs 
without 
reason, 
without 
which 
neither 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
nor 
other 
great 
truths 
could 
be 
well 
demonstrated. 
As 
to 
constraint, 
it 
is 
well 
to 
distinguish 
two 
species 
of 
it. 
The 
one 
physical, 
as 
when 
a 
man 
is 
taken 
to 
prison 
in 
spite 
of 
himself, 
or 
is 
thrown 
over 
a 
precipice; 
the 
other 
moral, 
as, 
for 
example, 
the 
constraint 
of 
a 
greater 
evil, 
and 
this 
action, 
although 
in 
some 
manner 
forced, 
is 
nevertheless 
voluntary. 
One 
can 
also 
be 
forced 
by 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
greater 
good, 
as 
when 
a 
man 
is 
tempted 
by 
having 
proposed 
to 
him 
a 
too 
great 
advantage, 
although 
this 
is 
not 
customarily 
called 
constraint. 


§ 
21. 
[Liberty 
belongs 
to 
the 
agent, 
or 
man.] 
When 
we 
reason 
about 
the 
liberty 
of 
the 
will, 
or 
about 
the 
free 
will, 
we 
do 
not 
ask 
if 
the 
man 
can 
do 
what 
he 
wishes, 
but 
if 
there 
is 
enough 
independence 
in 
his 
will 
itself. 
We 
do 
not 
ask 
if 
he 
has 
his 
limbs 
free 
or 
elbow-room, 
but 
if 
he 
has 
his 
spirit 
free 
and 
in 
what 
this 
consists. 
In 
this 
respect 
one 
intelligence 
could 
be 
more 
free 
than 
another, 
and 
the 
supreme 
intelligence 
will 
enjoy 
perfect 
liberty 
of 
which 
the 
creaturesarenotcapable. 


§§41, 
42. 
[All 
desire 
happiness. 
Happiness, 
what.] 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
the 
greatest 
pleasure 
is 
possible. 
I 
believe 
rather 
that 
it 
can 
grow 
ad 
infinitum; 
for 
we 
do 
not 
know 
how 
far 
our 
knowledge 
and 
our 
organs 
can 
be 
extended 
in 
all 
the 
eternity 
which 
awaits 
us. 
I 
believe 
then 
that 
happiness 
is 
a 
lasting 
pleasure; 
which 
could 
not 
be 
so 
without 
there 
being 
a 
continual 
progress 
to 
new 
pleasures. 
Therefore, 
of 
two 
persons, 
one 
of 
whom 
will 
go 
incomparably 



quicker 
and 
through 
greater 
pleasures 
than 
the 
other, 
each’ 
will 
be 
happy 
in 
himself 
and 
apart 
by 
himself, 
although 
their 
happiness 
will 
be 
very 
unequal. 
Happiness 
is 
then, 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
road 
through 
pleasures; 
and 
pleasure 
is 
merely 
a 
step 
and 
an 
advancement 
towards 
happiness, 
the 
shortest 
which 
can 
be 
made 
according 
to 
the 
present 
impressions, 
but 
not 
always 
the 
best. 
The 
right 
road 
may 
be 
missed 
in 
the 
desire 
to 
follow 
the 
shortest, 
as 
the 
stone 
which 
goes 
straight 
may 
encounter 
obstacles 
too 
soon, 
which 
prevent 
it 
from 
advancing 
quite 
to 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth. 
This 
shows 
that 
it 
is 
the 
reason 
and 
the 
will 
which 
transport 
us 
toward 
happiness, 
but 
that 
feeling 
and 
desire 
merely 
lead 
us 
to 
pleasure. 
Now, 
although 
pleasure 
can 
not 
receive 
a 
nominal 
definition, 
any 
more 
than 
light 
or 
color, 
it 
can 
however 
receive, 
like 
them, 
a 
causal 
definition; 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
at 
bottom 
pleasure 
is 
a 
feeling 
of 
perfection 
and 
pain 
a 
feeling 
of 
imperfection, 
provided 
it 
is 
noticeable 
enoughto 
causeustobeconscious 
ofit. 


§ 
47. 
[The 
power 
to 
suspend 
the 
prosecution 
of 
any 
desire 
makes 
way 
for 
consideration, 
and 
in 
this 
freedom 
of 
will 
consists.] 
The 
execution 
of 
our 
desire 
is 
suspended 
or 
arrested 
when 
this 
desire 
is 
not 
strong 
enough 
to 
move 
us, 
and 
to 
overcome 
the 
trouble 
and 
inconvenience 
of 
satisfying 
it. 
But 
when 
the 
desire 
is 
strongenough 
in 
itself 
to 
move 
us, 
if 
nothing 
prevents, 
it 
can 
be 
arrested 
by 
contrary 
inclinations, 
be 
it 
that 
they 
consist 
in 
a 
simple 
leaning 
which 
is 
like 
the 
element 
or 
the 
beginning 
of 
desire, 
be 
it 
that 
they 
extend 
to 
desire 
itself. 
Nevertheless 
as 
these 
inclinations, 
these 
leanings, 
and 
these 
contrary 
desires 
must 
be 
found 
already 
in 
the 
soul, 
it 
does 
not 
have 
them 
in 
its 
power, 
and 
consequently 
itcannot 
resist 
ina 
free 
and 
voluntarywaywhere 
the 
reason 
can 
take 
part, 
if 
it 
had 
not 
also 
another 
means 
which 
is 
that 
of 
turning 
the 
mind 
elsewhere. 
But 
how 
can 
we 
think 
of 
doing 
it 
when 
there 
is 
need? 
for 
this 
is 
the 
point, 
especially 
if 
we 
are 
possessed 
by 
a 
strong 
passion. 
There 
is 
need, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
mind 
be 
prepared 
beforehand, 
and 
find 
itself 



already 
ready 
to 
go 
from 
thought 
to 
thought 
in 
order 
not 
to 
stop 
too 
long 
in 
a 
slipperyand 
dangerousplace. 


For 
this, 
it 
is 
well 
to 
accustom 
one’s 
self 
generally 
not 
to 
think 
except 
in 
passing 
of 
certain 
things, 
in 
order 
the 
better 
to 
preserve 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
mind. 
Butthebestwayistoaccustomone’sself 
toproceedmethodically, 
and 
to 
attach 
one’s 
self 
to 
a 
train 
of 
thoughts 
the 
connection 
of 
which 
reason 
and 
not 
chance 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
insensible 
and 
casual 
impressions) 
establishes. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
do 
this, 
it 
is 
well 
to 
accustom 
one’s 
self 
to 
collect 
one’s 
self 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
and 
to 
raise 
one’s 
self 
above 
the 
present 
tumult 
of 
impressions, 
to 
go 
forth, 
so 
to 
say, 
from 
the 
place 
where 
one 
is, 
to 
say 
to 
one’s 
self 
“dic 
cur 
hic? 
respice 
finem, 
or 
where 
are 
we? 
or 
are 
we 
coming 
to 
the 
point?” 
Men 
would 
often 
have 
need 
of 
some 
one, 
established 
with 
an 
official 
title 
(as 
Philip, 
the 
father 
of 
Alexander 
the 
Great, 
had), 
to 
interrupt 
them 
and 
to 
recall 
them 
to 
their 
duty. 
But, 
for 
lack 
of 
such 
an 
officer, 
it 
is 
well 
for 
us 
ourselves 
to 
be 
accustomed 
to 
perform 
for 
ourselves 
this 
office. 
Now 
being 
once 
in 
a 
condition 
to 
arrest 
the 
effect 
of 
our 
desires 
and 
of 
our 
passions, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
suspend 
action, 
we 
can 
find 
the 
means 
of 
combating 
them, 
be 
it 
by 
the 
contrary 
desires 
or 
inclinations, 
be 
it 
by 
diversion, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
by 
occupations 
of 
another 
nature. 
It 
is 
by 
these 
methods 
and 
these 
artifices 
that 
we 
become, 
as 
it 
were, 
masters 
of 
ourselves, 
and 
that 
we 
can 
make 
ourselves 
think 
and 
do 
in 
time 
what 
we 
would 
will 
to 
and 
what 
reason 
commands. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
always 
by 
determined 
ways 
and 
never 
without 
ground 
or 
by 
the 
imaginary 
principle 
of 
a 
perfect 
indifference 
or 
equilibrium, 
in 
which 
some 
would 
make 
the 
essence 
of 
liberty 
to 
consist, 
as 
if 
one 
could 
determine 
himself 
groundlessly 
and 
even 
against 
all 
ground, 
and 
go 
directly 
counter 
to 
the 
prevalence 
of 
the 
impressions 
andtheinclinations.

[The

True 
happiness 
ought 
always 
to

the 
object 
of 
our

there 
is 



ground 
for 
doubting 
whether 
it 
is. 
For 
often 
we 
hardly

of 
it,

I 
have

CHAPTER 
XXIII. 


Of 
our 
complex 
ideas 
of 
substances. 



§ 
1. 
[IDEAS 
of 
substances, 
how 
made.] 
On 
the 
contrary 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
concretum 
as 
odorous, 
as 
warm, 
as 
glittering, 
which 
comes 
into 
our 
minds, 
rather 
than 
the 
abstractions 
or 
qualities 
(for 
it 
is 
they 
which 
are 
in 
the 
substantial 
object 
and 
not 
the 
ideas) 
as, 
namely, 
heat, 
light, 
etc. 
which 
are 
much 
more 
difficult 
to 
comprehend. 
It 
may 
even 
be 
doubted 
whether 
these 
accidents 
are 
real 
entities, 
as 
in 
fact 
they 
are 
very 
often 
only 
relations. 
It 
is 
known 
also 
that 
it 
is 
the 
abstractions 
which 
occasion 
most 
difficulty 
when 
it 
is 
desired 
to 
examine 
them 
minutely, 
as 
those 
know 
who 
are 
acquainted 
with 
the 
subtilties 
of 
the 
scholastics, 
whose 
most 
intricate 
speculations 
fall 
at 
one 
blow 
if 
we 
will 
banish 
abstract 
entities 
and 
resolve 
not 
to 
speak 
ordinarily 
except 
by 
concretes, 
and 
not 
to 
admit 
any 
other 
terms 
in 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
sciences, 
but 
those 
which 
represent 
substantial 
subjects. 
Thus 
it 
is 
nodum 
quoerere 
in 
scirpo, 
if 
I 
dare 
say 
it, 
and 
to 
invert 
things, 
if 
we 
take 
the 
qualities 
or 
other 
abstract 
terms 
for 
what 
is 
easiest 
and 
the 
concrete 
ones 
for 
somethingverydifficult. 


§2. 
[Our 
idea 
of 
substance 
in 
general.] 
In 
distinguishing 
two 
things 
in 
substance, 
attributes 
or 
predicates 
and 
the 
common 
subject 
of 
these 
predicates, 
it 
is 
not 
strange 
that 
nothing 
in 
particular 
can 
be 
conceived 
in 
this 
subject. 
It 
must 
necessarily 
be 
so, 
since 
we 
have 
already 
separated 
all 
the 
attributes 
in 
which 
some 
detail 
could 
be 
conceived. 
Therefore 
to 
demand 
somethingmore 
in 
this 
pure 
subjectin 
general 
thanwhat 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
conceive 
that 
it 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
(e. 
g. 
which 
understands 
and 
wills, 
which 
imagines 
and 
reasons), 
this 
is 
to 
demand 
the 
impossible 
and 
to 
run 
counter 
to 



one’s 
own 
supposition, 
made 
in 
abstracting 
and 
in 
conceiving 
separately 
the 
subject 
and 
its 
qualities 
or 
accidents. 
The 
same 
pretended 
difficulty 
could 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
being 
and 
to 
all 
that 
is 
most 
clear 
and 
most 
primitive; 
forwe 
couldask 
philosophers 
what 
they 
conceiveinconceivingpurebeing 
in 
general; 
for 
all 
detail, 
being 
thereby 
excluded, 
there 
would 
be 
as 
little 
to 
say 
as 
when 
it 
is 
asked 
what 
pure 
substance 
in 
general 
is. 
I 
think, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
philosophers 
do 
not 
deserve 
to 
be 
ridiculed, 
as 
is 
done 
here 
in 
comparing 
them 
to 
the 
Indian 
philosopher, 
who 
when 
asked 
what 
the 
earth 
rested 
on, 
replied 
that 
it 
was 
a 
large 
elephant, 
and 
when 
asked 
what 
the 
elephant 
rested 
on, 
said 
that 
it 
was 
a 
great 
tortoise, 
and, 
finally, 
when 
pressed 
to 
tell 
what 
the 
tortoise 
rested 
on, 
was 
reduced 
to 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
something, 
I 
know 
not 
what. 
However, 
the 
consideration 
of 
substance, 
very 
inconsiderable 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
be, 
is 
not 
so 
void 
and 
sterile 
as 
is 
thought. 
Certain 
consequences 
come 
from 
it 
which 
are 
most 
important 
to 
philosophy, 
and 
which 
are 
capable 
ofgivingit 
anew 
aspect.

13, 
§

§ 
4. 
[No 
clear 
idea 
of 
substance 
in 
general.] 
For 
my 
part, 
I 
believe 
that 
this 
opinion 
of 
our 
ignorance 
comes 
from 
our 
demanding 
a 
kind 
of 
knowledge 
which 
the 
object 
does 
not 
permit 
of.

§

[Ideas

Itis 
well 
said, 
and 
it 
is 
very 
true, 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
more 
certain 
thanthatofsensibleobjects. 



CHAPTER 
XXV. 


Of 
relation. 



§ 
1. 
[RELATION, 
what.] 
Relations 
and 
orders 
are 
like 
entities 
of 
reason, 
although 
they 
have 
their 
foundation 
in 
things; 
for 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
their 
reality, 
like 
that 
of 
eternal 
truths 
and 
possibilities, 
comes 
from 
the 
supreme 
reason. 



CHAPTER 
XXVII. 


Of 
identity 
and 
diversity. 



§ 
1. 
[WHEREIN 
identity 
consists.] 
There 
must 
always 
be, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
difference 
of 
time 
and 
of 
place, 
an 
internal 
principle 
of 
distinction; 
and 
although 
there 
are 
many 
things 
of 
the 
same 
species, 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
true 
therearenever 
anyperfectlysimilar:thusalthoughtime 
andplace(thatis,the 
relation 
to 
the 
external) 
serve 
us 
in 
distinguishing 
things 
which 
we 
do 
not 
well 
distinguish 
through 
themselves, 
things 
are 
none 
the 
less 
distinguishable 
in 
themselves. 
The 
characteristic 
of 
identity 
and 
of 
diversity 
does 
not 
consist, 
therefore,intimeand 
inplace. 


§ 
3. 
[Principium 
individuation 
is.] 
The 
principle 
of 
individuation 
corresponds 
in 
individuals 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
distinction 
of 
which 
I 
have 
just 
spoken. 
If 
two 
individuals 
were 
perfectly 
similar 
and 
equal, 
and 
(in 
a 
word) 
indistinguishable 
in 
themselves, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
principle 
of 
individuation; 
and 
I 
even 
venture 
to 
say 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
individual 
distinction, 
or 
differentindividuals,onthiscondition. 


§ 
9. 
[Personal 
identity.] 
I 
am 
also 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
consciousness, 
or 
the 
feeling 
of 
the 
ego, 
proves 
a 
moral 
or 
personal 
identity. 
And 
it 
is 
in 
this 
that 
I 
distinguish 
the 
unceasingness 
of 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
brute 
from 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul 
of 
man: 
both 
retain 
physical 
and 
real 
identity; 
but 
as 
for 
man, 
it 
is 
conformed 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
divine 
providence 
that 
the 
soul 
preserve 
in 
addition 
moral 
identity 
which 
belongs 
to 
us 
in 
order 
to 
constitute 
the 
same 
person, 
capable 
consequently 
of 
feeling 
punishments 
and 
recompenses. 
It 
appears 
that 
you, 
sir, 
hold 
that 
this 
apparent 
identity 
might 
be 
preserved, 
even 
if 
there 
should 
be 
norealidentity. 
Ishouldbelieve 
that 
this 
mightperhaps 
bepossible 



by 
the 
absolute 
power 
of 
God; 
but 
according 
to 
the 
order 
of 
things 
the 
identity 
apparent 
to 
the 
person 
himself, 
who 
feels 
himself 
the 
same, 
supposes 
the 
real 
identity 
at 
each 
following 
stage, 
accompanied 
by 
reflection 
or 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
the 
ego, 
an 
intimate 
and 
immediate 
perception 
not 
being 
able 
to 
deceive 
naturally. 
If 
man 
could 
be 
only 
a 
machine 
and 
have 
in 
addition 
consciousness, 
itwouldbenecessarytobe 
ofyouropinion, 
sir; 
butIhold 
that 
this 
case 
is 
not 
possible, 
at 
least 
naturally. 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
to 
say 
either 
that 
personal 
identity 
and 
even 
the 
ego 
do 
not 
remain 
in 
us, 
and 
that 
I 
am 
not 
that 
ego 
which 
was 
in 
the 
cradle, 
under 
the 
pretext 
that 
I 
no 
longer 
remember 
anything 
winch 
I 
then 
did. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
in 
order 
to 
find 
moral 
identity 
by 
itself 
that 
there 
be 
a 
common 
bond 
of 
consciousness 
from 
a 
neighboring 
state, 
or 
even 
one 
a 
little 
removed, 
to 
another, 
even 
if 
some 
leap 
or 
forgotten 
interval 
should 
be 
mingled 
with 
it. 
Thus, 
if 
an 
illness 
had 
caused 
an 
interruption 
of 
the 
continuity 
of 
the 
connection 
of 
consciousness 
so 
that 
I 
should 
not 
know 
how 
I 
had 
come 
into 
the 
present 
state, 
although 
I 
might 
remember 
more 
distant 
things, 
the 
testimony 
of 
others 
might 
fill 
the 
gap 
of 
my 
remembrance. 
I 
might 
even 
be 
punished 
on 
this 
testimony 
if 
I 
had 
done 
some 
evil 
of 
deliberate 
forethought 
in 
an 
interval 
which 
I 
had 
forgotten 
a 
little 
while 
afterwards 
through 
this 
illness. 
And 
if 
I 
came 
to 
forget 
all 
past 
things, 
so 
that 
I 
should 
be 
obliged 
to 
let 
myself 
be 
taught 
anew, 
even 
to 
my 
name 
and 
to 
reading 
and 
writing, 
I 
could 
always 
learn 
from 
others 
my 
past 
life 
in 
my 
preceding 
state, 
as 
I 
have 
preserved 
my 
rights 
without 
its 
being 
necessary 
to 
divide 
myself 
into 
two 
persons, 
and 
to 
make 
myself 
my 
own 
heir. 
All 
this 
suffices 
for 
maintaining 
the 
moral 
identity 
which 
makes 
the 
same 
person. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
if 
others 
conspired 
to 
deceive 
me 
(as 
I 
might 
even 
be 
deceivedby 
myself, 
by 
somevision, 
dream 
or 
illness, 
believing 
that 
whatI 
dreamed 
had 
happened 
to 
me), 
the 
appearance 
would 
be 
false; 
but 
there 
are 
cases 
in 
which 
we 
may 
be 
morally 
certain 
of 
the 
truth 
upon 
the 
report 
of 



others; 
and 
in 
relation 
to 
God 
whose 
bond 
of 
union 
with 
us 
makes 
the 
principal 
point 
of 
morality, 
error 
cannot 
enter. 
As 
regards 
the 
ego, 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
ego 
and 
from 
consciousness. 
The 
ego 
forms 
the 
real 
and 
physical 
identity, 
and 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
ego, 
accompanied 
by 
truth, 
joins 
to 
it 
personal 
identity. 
Thus 
not 
wishing 
to 
say 
that 
personal 
identity 
does 
not 
extend 
farther 
than 
memory, 
I 
would 
say 
still 
less 
that 
the 
ego 
or 
physical 
identity 
depends 
on 
it. 
The 
real 
and 
personal 
identity 
is 
proved 
as 
certainly 
as 
is 
possible 
in 
matter 
of 
fact, 
by 
present 
and 
immediate 
reflection; 
it 
is 
proved 
sufficiently 
for 
common 
use 
by 
our 
remembrance 
of 
the 
interval, 
or 
by 
the 
corroborating 
testimony 
of 
others. 
‘But 
if 
God 
changed 
extraordinarily 
real 
identity, 
personal 
identity 
would 
remain, 
provided 
that 
man 
should 
preserve 
the 
appearances 
of 
identity, 
as 
well 
the 
internal 
(that 
is 
of 
consciousness) 
as 
the 
external, 
like 
those 
appearances 
which 
consist 
in 
what 
is 
evident 
to 
others. 
Thus 
consciousness 
is 
not 
the 
only 
means 
of 
establishing 
personal 
identity, 
and 
the 
report 
of 
others 
or 
even 
other 
marks 
may 
take 
its 
place. 
But 
there 
is 
difficulty 
if 
contradiction 
is 
found 
between 
these 
different 
evidences. 
Consciousness 
may 
be 
silent 
as 
in 
forgetfulness; 
but 
if 
it 
said 
very 
distinctly 
things 
which 
were 
contrary 
to 
the 
other 
evidences, 
we 
should 
be 
embarrassed 
in 
the 
decision 
and 
sometimes 
as 
if 
suspended 
between 
two 
possibilities: 
that 
of 
the 
error 
of 
our 
memory 
and 
that 
ofsomedeceptionintheexternalevidences. 


§ 
14. 
An 
immaterial 
being 
or 
a 
spirit 
cannot 
be 
despoiled 
of 
all 
perception 
of 
its 
past 
existence. 
There 
remain 
to 
it 
impressions 
of 
everything 
which 
has 
formerly 
happened 
to 
it 
and 
it 
has 
even 
presentiments 
of 
everything 
which 
will 
happen 
to 
it; 
but 
these 
feelings 
are 
most 
often 
too 
slight 
to 
be 
distinguishable 
and 
for 
us 
to 
be 
conscious 
of 
them, 
although 
they 
may 
be 
developed 
some 
day. 
This 
continuation 
and 
connection 
of 
perceptions 
forms 
the 
same 
individual 
really; 
but 
apperceptions 
(that 
is, 
when 
we 
are 
conscious 



of 
past 
feelings) 
prove, 
farther, 
a 
moral 
identity 
and 
make 
the 
real 
identity 
appear 
— 
The 
late 
M. 
Van 
Helmont, 
the 
younger, 
believed, 
with 
certain 
rabbis, 
in 
the 
passing 
of 
the 
soul 
of 
Adam 
into 
the 
Messiah 
as 
into 
the 
new 
Adam. 
And 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
he 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
he 
himself 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
ancients, 
very 
able 
man 
as 
he 
was 
otherwise. 
Now, 
if 
this 
passing 
of 
souls 
was 
true, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
possible 
way 
which 
I 
have 
explained 
above 
(but 
which 
does 
not 
appear 
probable), 
that 
is, 
that 
souls, 
retaining 
subtile 
bodies 
should 
pass 
suddenly 
into 
other 
gross 
bodies, 
the 
same 
individual 
would 
subsist 
always, 
in 
Nestor, 
in 
Socrates, 
and 
in 
some 
modern, 
and 
he 
might 
even 
make 
known 
his 
identity 
to 
that 
one 
who 
should 
sufficiently 
penetrate 
into 
his 
nature, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
impressions 
or 
characters 
which 
would 
there 
remain 
of 
all 
that 
Nestor 
or 
Socrates 
has 
done, 
and 
which 
some 
sufficiently 
penetrating 
genius 
might 
read 
there. 
However, 
if 
the 
modern 
man 
had 
no 
internal 
or 
external 
means 
of 
knowing 
what 
he 
has 
been, 
it 
would 
be, 
so 
far 
as 
ethics 
is 
concerned, 
as 
if 
he 
had 
not 
been 
at 
all. 
But 
the 
probability 
is 
that 
nothing 
is 
neglected 
in 
the 
world, 
even 
in 
relation 
to 
morals, 
because 
God 
is 
its 
monarch, 
and 
his 
government 
is 
perfect. 
— 
Thus 
if 
souls 
passed 
into 
a 
new 
body 
gross 
or 
sensitive, 
they 
would 
always 
retain 
the 
expression 
of 
all 
of 
which 
they 
have 
had 
perception 
in 
the 
old, 
and 
it 
would 
even 
be 
necessary 
that 
the 
new 
body 
should 
feel 
it 
all 
so 
that 
the 
individualcontinuation 
willalwaysleaveits 
realmarks. 


§18. 
[Object 
of 
reward 
and 
punishment.] 
I 
confess 
that 
if 
God 
caused 
consciousnesses 
to 
be 
transferred 
toother 
souls, 
it 
would 
be 
necessarytotreat 
them, 
according 
to 
ethical 
ideas, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
the 
same; 
but 
this 
would 
be 
to 
disturb 
the 
orderofthingsgroundlessly, 
andto 
make 
a 
divorcebetweenthe 
apperceptible 
and 
truth, 
which 
is 
preserved 
by 
insensible 
perceptions. 
This 
would 
not 
be 
rational 
because 
perceptions, 
at 
present 
insensible, 
may 
be 



developed 
some 
day, 
for 
there 
is 
nothing 
useless, 
and 
eternity 
presents 
a 
large 
fieldforchanges. 


§ 
29. 
[Continued 
existence 
makes 
identity.] 
I 
have 
pointed 
out 
to 
you 
the 
source 
of 
true 
physical 
identity; 
I 
have 
shown 
you 
that 
morals 
do 
not 
contradict 
it, 
any 
more 
than 
memory; 
that 
they 
could 
not 
always 
mark 
out 
physical 
identity 
to 
the 
person 
himself 
in 
question, 
nor 
to 
those 
who 
are 
in 
communication 
with 
him; 
but 
that 
nevertheless 
they 
never 
contradict 
physical 
identity, 
and 
never 
are 
divorced 
from 
it; 
that 
there 
are 
always 
created 
spirits 
which 
know 
or 
may 
know 
what 
is 
the 
truth 
respecting 
it; 
but 
that 
there

Of

§ 
5. 
[MORAL 
good 
and 
evil.] 
I 
should 
prefer, 
for 
myself, 
to 
take 
as 
the 
measure 
of 
moral 
good 
and 
of 
virtue 
the 
invariable 
rule 
of 
reason 
that 
God 
has 
charged 
himself 
to 
maintain. 
Also 
we 
may 
he 
assured 
that 
by 
his 
means 
every 
moral 
good 
becomes 
physical, 
or, 
as 
the 
ancients 
said, 
all 
that 
is 
praiseworthy 
is 
useful; 
whereas, 
in 
order 
to 
express 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
author, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
say 
that 
moral 
good 
or 
evil 
is 
a 
good 
or 
evil 
of 
imposition 
or 
institutive, 
which 
he 
who 
has 
the 
power 
in 
his 
hand 
tries 
to 
bring 
about 
or 
to 
prevent 
by 
pains 
or 
recompenses. 
Good 
is 
that 
which 
by 
the 
generalinstitutionofGod

CHAPTER 
XXIX. 


Of 
clear 
and 
obscure, 
distinct 
and 
confused 
ideas. 



§ 
2. 
IN 
a 
short 
essay 
on 
ideas, 
true 
or 
false, 
clear 
or 
obscure, 
distinct 
or 
confused, 
inserted 
in 
the 
Acta 
of 
Leipsic 
in 
the 
year 
1684, 
I 
have 
given 
a 
definition 
of 
dear 
ideas 
which 
is 
common 
to 
simples 
and 
compounds, 
and 
which 
accountsforwhatis 
saidthereonhere. 


§ 
13. 
[Complex 
ideas 
may 
be 
distinct 
in 
one 
part 
and 
confused 
in 
another.] 
This 
example 
[a 
chiliagon] 
shows 
that 
idea 
is 
here 
confounded 
with 
image. 
If 
someone 
proposes 
to 
me 
a 
regular 
polygon, 
sight 
and 
imagination 
could 
notmake 
me 
understand 
the 
thousand 
sideswhich 
are 
in 
it; 
I 
have 
only 
a 
confused 
idea 
both 
of 
the 
figure 
and 
of 
its 
number, 
until 
I 
distinguish 
the 
number 
by 
counting. 
But 
having 
found 
it, 
I 
know 
very 
well 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
proposed 
polygon, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
those 
of 
a 
chiliagon, 
and 
consequently 
I 
have 
the 
idea 
of 
it; 
but 
I 
could 
not 
have 
the 
image 
of 
a 
chiliagon, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
have 
the 
senses 
and 
the 
imagination 
more 
delicate 
and 
better 
exercised 
in 
order 
to 
thereby 
distinguish 
it 
from 
a 
polygon 
which 
should 
have 
one 
side 
less. 
But 
knowledge 
of 
figures 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
the 
imagination 
any 
more 
than 
that 
of 
numbers, 
although 
it 
is 
of 
use 
thereto; 
and 
a 
mathematician 
may 
know 
exactly 
the 
nature 
of 
an 
enneagon 
or 
of 
a 
decagon 
because 
he 
has 
the 
means 
ofmakingandexaminingthem,although 
hecannotdistinguishthembysight. 
It 
is 
true 
then 
that 
a 
workman 
or 
an 
engineer, 
who 
should 
not 
perhaps 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
figures 
sufficiently, 
might, 
have 
this 
advantage 
over 
a 
great 
geometrician, 
that 
he 
could 
distinguish 
them 
by 
merely 
seeing 
them 
without 
measuring 
them; 
as 
there 
are 
porters 
who 
will 
tell 
the 
weight 
of 
what 
they 
are 



to 
carry 
without 
the 
mistake 
of 
a 
pound, 
in 
which 
they 
will 
surpass 
the 
most 
skillful 
statistician 
in 
the 
world. 
This 
empirical 
knowledge, 
acquired 
by 
long 
practice, 
may 
have 
great 
advantage 
for 
acting 
promptly, 
as 
an 
engineer 
very 
often 
needs 
to 
do 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
danger 
to 
which 
he 
exposes 
himself 
by 
hesitating. 
However 
this 
clear 
image, 
or 
this 
feeling 
which 
we 
may 
have 
of 
a 
regular 
decagon 
or 
of 
a 
weight 
of 
ninety-nine 
pounds, 
consists 
only 
in 
a 
confused 
idea, 
since 
it 
is 
of 
no 
use 
in 
discovering 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
properties 
of 
this 
weight 
or 
of 
the 
regular 
decagon, 
which 
requires 
a 
distinct 
idea. 
And 
this 
example 
serves 
to 
show 
better 
the 
difference 
between 
ideas, 
or 
rather 
thatbetween 
ideaand 
image. 


§ 
15. 
[Instance 
in 
eternity] 
This 
example 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
fit 
your 
purpose 
any 
better: 
but 
it 
is 
very 
appropriate 
to 
mine, 
which 
is 
to 
disabuse 
you 
of 
your 
notions 
on 
this 
point. 
For 
there 
reigns 
here 
the 
same 
confusion 
between 
image 
and 
idea. 
We 
have 
a 
complete 
and 
proper 
idea 
of 
eternity, 
since 
we 
have 
a 
definition 
of 
it, 
although 
we 
have 
no 
image 
of 
it; 
but 
the 
idea 
of 
infinites 
is 
not 
formed 
by 
the 
composition 
of 
parts, 
and 
the 
errors 
which 
are 
committed 
in 
reasoning 
concerning 
the 
infinite 
do 
not 
come 
from 
the 
lack 
ofimage.

Knowledge

who

he, 
I

will 
have 
more 
knowledge 
than

even 
if 
there 
should 
not 
be 
a 
word 
of 
truth 
in 
all 
which 
has 
been 
portrayed 
or 
related 
to 
him; 
for 
the 
practice 
which 
he 
has 
in 
representing 
to 
himself 
mentally 
many 
express 
and 
actual 
conceptions 
or 
ideas, 
renders 
him 
more 
tit 
to 
conceive 
what 
is 
proposed 
to 
him; 
and 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
he 
will 
be 
better 
instructed 
and 
more 
capable 
than 
another, 
who 
has 
neither 
seen 
nor 
read 
nor 
heard 
anything, 
provided 
that 
in 
these 
stories 
and 
representations 
he 
does 
not 
take 
for 
true 
that 
which 
is 
not 
true, 
and 
that 
these 
impressions 
do 
not 
hinder 
him 
otherwise 
from 
distinguishing 
the 
real 
from 
the 
imaginary, 
or 
the 
existing 
from 
the 
possible.... 
But 
taking 
knowledge 
in 
a 
narrower 
meaning, 
that 
is, 
for 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
as 
you 
do 
here, 
sir, 
I 
say 
that 
it 
is 
very 
true 
that 
truth 
is 
always 
founded 
in 
the 
agreement 
or 
disagreement 
of 
ideas, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
true 
generally 
that 
our 
knowledge 
of 
truth 
is 
a 
perception 
of 
this 
agreement 
or 
disagreement. 
For 
when 
we 
know 
truth 
only 
empirically, 
from 
having 
experienced 
it 
without 
knowing 
the 
connection 
of 
things 
and 
the 
reason 
which 
there 
is 
in 
what 
we 
have 
experienced, 
we 
have 
no 
perception 
of 



this 
agreement 
or 
disagreement, 
unless 
it 
be 
meant 
that 
we 
feel 
it 
confusedly 
without 
being 
conscious 
of 
it. 
But 
your 
examples, 
it 
seems, 
show 
that 
you 
always 
require 
a 
knowledge 
in 
which 
one 
is 
conscious 
of 
connection 
or 
of 
opposition,andthis

CHAPTER 
II. 


Of 
the 
degrees 
of 
our 
knowledge. 



§ 
1. 
[INTUITIVE.] 
Primitive 
truths, 
which 
are 
known 
by 
intuition 
are 
of 
two 
kinds, 
like 
the 
derivative. 
They 
are 
either 
truths 
of 
reason, 
or 
truths 
of 
fact. 
Truthsof 
reasonarenecessaryandthose 
offactarecontingent. 
Primitive 
truths 
of 
reason 
are 
those 
which 
I 
call 
by 
the 
general 
name 
of 
identical, 
because 
it 
seems 
that 
they 
do 
nothing 
but 
repeat 
the 
same 
thing 
without 
giving 
usany 
information. 
Theyareaffirmativeornegative.... 


As 
respects 
primitive 
truths 
of 
fact, 
they 
are 
the 
immediate 
internal 
experiences 
of 
an 
immediateness 
of 
feeling. 
And 
here 
it 
is 
that 
the 
first 
truth 
of 
the 
Cartesians 
or 
of 
St. 
Augustine: 
I 
think, 
hence 
I 
am, 
that 
is, 
I 
am 
a 
thing 
which 
thinks, 
holds 
good. 
But 
it 
should 
be 
known 
that 
just 
as 
the 
identicals 
aregeneralorparticular, 
and 
that 
the 
oneclass 
is 
asclear 
asthe 
other 
(since 
it 
is 
just 
as 
clear 
to 
say 
that 
A 
is 
A, 
as 
to 
say 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
what 
it 
is), 
so 
it 
is 
also 
with 
first 
truths 
of 
fact. 
For 
not 
only 
is 
it 
clear 
to 
me 
immediately 
that 
I 
think; 
but 
it 
is 
just 
as 
clear 
to 
me 
that 
I 
have 
different 
thoughts; 
that 
sometimes 
I 
think 
of 
A, 
and 
that 
sometimes 
I 
think 
of 
B, 
etc. 
Thus 
the 
Cartesian 
principle 
is 
good, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
only 
one 
of 
its 
kind. 
You 
see 
therefore 
that 
all 
primitive 
truths 
of 
reason 
pr 
of 
fact 
have 
this 
in 
common, 
that 
theycannotbe 
provedbyanything 
more 
certain. 


§ 
14. 
[Sensitive 
knowledge 
of 
particular 
existence.] 
But 
let 
us 
come 
to 
this 
controversy 
which 
the 
sceptics 
carry 
on 
with 
the 
dogmatists 
over 
the 
existence 
of 
things 
outside 
of 
us. 
We 
have 
already 
touched 
upon 
it, 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
return 
to 
it 
here. 
I 
have 
formerly 
discussed 
it 
thoroughly 
both 
verbally 
and 
in 
writing, 
with 
the 
late 
Abbé 
Foucher, 
Canon 
of 
Dijon, 
a 



learned 
and 
subtle 
man. 
— 
Now 
I 
made 
him 
admit 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
sensible 
things 
consisted 
only 
in 
the 
connection 
of 
phenomena, 
which 
must 
have 
its 
reason, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
this 
which 
distinguishes 
them 
from 
dreams; 
but 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
our 
existence 
and 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
phenomena 
is 
of 
another 
kind, 
because 
it 
establishes 
substances; 
and 
that 
the 
sceptics 
spoiled 
whatever 
they 
say 
that 
is 
good, 
by 
carrying 
it 
too 
far, 
and 
by 
wishing 
even 
to 
extend 
their 
doubts 
to 
immediate 
experiences 
and 
to 
geometrical 
truths 
(a 
thing 
which 
M. 
Foucher, 
however 
did 
not 
do), 
and 
to 
the 
other 
truths 
of 
reason, 
which 
he 
did 
a 
little 
too 
much. 
But 
to 
return 
to 
ourselves, 
sir; 
you 
are 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
there 
is 
ordinarily 
a 
difference 
between 
feelings 
and 
imaginations; 
but 
the 
sceptics 
will 
say 
that 
more 
or 
less 
does 
not 
change 
the 
kind. 
Besides, 
although 
feelings 
are 
wont 
to 
be 
more 
vivid 
than 
imaginations, 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
nevertheless 
that 
there 
are 
cases 
where 
an 
imaginative 
person 
is 
impressed 
by 
his 
imaginations 
as 
much 
or 
perhaps 
more 
than 
another 
is 
by 
the 
truth 
of 
things; 
so 
that 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
true 
criterion 
as 
regards 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
senses 
is 
the 
connection 
of 
phenomena, 
that 
is, 
the 
connection 
of 
that 
which 
takes 
place 
in 
different 
places 
and 
times, 
and 
in 
the 
experience 
of 
different 
men, 
who 
are 
themselves, 
each 
to 
the 
others, 
very 
important 
phenomena 
on 
this 
score. 
And 
the 
connection 
of 
phenomena, 
which 
guarantees 
truths 
of 
fact 
in 
respect 
to 
sensible 
things 
outside 
of 
us, 
is 
verified 
by 
means 
of 
truths 
of 
reason 
as 
the 
appearances 
of 
optics 
are 
explained 
by 
geometry. 
However 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
all 
this 
certainty 
is 
not 
of 
the 
highest 
degree, 
as 
you 
have 
well 
recognized. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
impossible, 
speaking 
metaphysically, 
that 
theremay 
be 
a 
dream, 
continuous 
and 
lasting, 
like 
the 
life 
of 
a 
man;but 
it 
is 
a 
thing 
as 
contrary 
to 
reason 
as 
would 
be 
the 
fiction 
of 
a 
book 
which 
should 
be 
formed 
at 
haphazard 
by 
throwing 
the 
type 
together 
pell 
mell. 
For 
the 
rest, 
it 
is 
also 
true 
that, 
provided 
the 
phenomena 
he 
connected, 
it 
does 
not 
matter 
whether 
they 
are 
called 
dreams 
or 
not, 
since 
experience 
shows 
that 
we 
are 
not 



deceived 
in 
the 
measures 
taken 
concerning 
phenomena 
when 
they 
are 
understood 
according 
tothetruths 
ofreason 



CHAPTERIII. 


Of 
the 
extent 
of 
human 
knowledge. 



§ 
6. 
[“WHETHER 
any 
mere 
material 
being 
thinks 
or 
no.”] 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
I 
declare 
to 
you, 
sir, 
that 
when 
one 
has 
only 
confused 
ideas 
of 
thought 
and 
of 
matter, 
as 
one 
ordinarily 
has, 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
wondered 
at 
if 
one 
does 
not 
see 
the 
means 
of 
solving 
such 
questions. 
It 
is 
as 
I 
have 
remarked 
before 
that 
a 
person 
who 
has 
not 
ideas 
of 
the 
angles 
of 
a 
triangle 
except 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
one 
has 
them 
generally, 
will 
never 
think 
of 
finding 
out 
that 
they 
are 
always 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles. 
It 
must 
be 
considered 
that 
matter, 
taken 
for 
a 
complete 
being 
(that 
is, 
secondary 
matter 
opposed 
to 
primary, 
which 
is 
something 
simply 
passive 
and 
consequently 
incomplete), 
is 
only 
a 
mass, 
or 
that 
which 
results 
therefrom, 
and 
that 
every 
real 
mass 
supposes 
simple 
substances 
or 
real 
unities; 
and 
when 
we 
consider 
farther 
what 
belongs 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
real 
unities, 
that 
is, 
perception 
and 
its 
consequences, 
we 
are 
transported, 
so 
to 
speak, 
into 
another 
world, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
into 
the 
intelligible 
world 
of 
substances, 
whereas 
before 
we 
have 
been 
only 
among 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
senses. 
And 
this 
knowledge 
of 
the 
interior 
of 
matter 
shows 
sufficiently 
of 
what 
it 
is 
naturally 
capable, 
and 
that 
every 
time 
that 
God 
shall 
give 
organs 
fitted 
to 
express 
reasoning, 
the 
immaterial 
substance 
which 
reasons 
will 
not 
fail 
to 
be 
also 
given 
to 
it, 
by 
virtue 
of 
this 
harmony, 
which 
is 
again 
a 
natural 
result 
of 
substances. 
Matter 
could 
not 
subsist 
without 
immaterial 
substances, 
that 
is, 
without 
unities; 
after 
which 
it 
ought 
no 
longer 
to 
be 
asked 
whether 
God 
is 
at 
liberty 
to 
give 
them 
to 
it 
or 
not. 
And 
if 
these 
substances 
did 
not 
have 
in 
themselves 
the 
correspondence 
or 
harmony, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
just 
spoken, 
God 
would 
not 
act 
according 
to 
the 
natural 
order. 



To 
speak 
very 
simply 
of 
giving 
or 
of 
according 
powers 
is 
to 
return 
to 
the 
naked 
faculties 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
and 
to 
imagine 
minute 
subsisting 
beings, 
which 
can 
enter 
and 
depart 
like 
the 
pigeons 
of 
a 
pigeon-house. 
It 
is 
making 
substances 
of 
them 
without 
thinking 
of 
it. 
The 
primitive 
powers 
constitute 
substances 
themselves;and 
the 
derivative 
powers, 
or, 
if 
you 
like, 
the 
faculties 
areonly 
modes 
of 
being 
which 
must 
be 
derived 
from 
substances, 
and 
they 
are 
not 
derived 
from 
matter 
as 
a 
machine 
merely, 
that 
is, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
we 
consider 
it 
abstractly 
only 
as 
the 
incomplete 
being 
of 
primary 
matter, 
or 
the 
simply 
passive. 
Here 
I 
think 
that 
you 
will 
agree 
with 
me, 
sir, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
power 
of 
a 
mere 
mechanism 
to 
cause 
perception, 
sensation, 
reason, 
to 
arise. 
They 
must 
therefore 
spring 
from 
some 
other 
substantial 
thing. 
To 
think 
that 
God 
acts 
differently 
and 
gives 
to 
things 
accidents 
which 
are 
not 
modes 
of 
being 
or 
modifications 
derived 
from 
substances, 
is 
to 
resort 
to 
miracles 
and 
to 
what 
the 
schoolmen 
called 
the 
obediential 
power, 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
supernatural 
exaltation, 
as 
when 
certain 
theologians 
claim 
that 
the 
fire 
of 
hell 
burns 
separated 
souls; 
in 
which 
case 
it 
might 
be 
even 
doubted 
if 
it 
were 
the 
fire 
which 
acted, 
and 
if 
God 
did 
not 
himself 
produce 
the 
effect, 
by 
acting 
in 
place 
ofthefire 
— 


The 
difficulty 
which 
remains 
is 
only 
in 
respect 
to 
those 
who 
wish 
to 
imagine 
what 
is 
only 
intelligible, 
as 
if 
they 
wanted 
to 
see 
sounds, 
or 
hear 
colors. 



CHAPTER 
IV. 


Of 
the 
reality 
of 
human 
knowledge. 



§§ 
1-5. 
[KNOWLEDGE 
placed 
in 
ideas 
may 
be 
all 
bare 
vision.Answer.] 
Our 
certainty 
would 
be 
slight 
or 
rather 
none, 
if 
it 
had 
no 
other 
foundation 
for 
simple 
ideas 
than 
that 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
senses. 
Have 
you 
forgotten, 
sir, 
how 
I 
showed 
that 
ideas 
are 
originally 
in 
our 
mind 
and 
that 
even 
our 
thoughts 
come 
to 
us 
from 
our 
own 
depths, 
without 
its 
being 
possible 
for 
other 
creatures 
to 
have 
an 
immediate 
influence 
upon 
the 
soul. 
Moreover 
the 
ground 
of 
our 
certainty 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
universal 
and 
eternal 
truths 
lies 
in 
the 
ideas 
themselves 
independently 
of 
the 
senses; 
as 
also 
pure 
and 
intelligible 
ideas 
do 
not 
depend 
upon 
the 
senses, 
for 
example, 
that 
of 
being, 
of 
one, 
of 
the 
same, 
etc. 
But 
the 
ideas 
of 
sensible 
qualities, 
as 
of 
color, 
of 
flavor, 
etc. 
(which 
in 
reality 
are 
only 
appearances), 
come 
to 
us 
from 
the 
senses, 
that 
is, 
from 
our 
confused 
perceptions. 
And 
the 
ground 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
contingent 
and 
particular 
things 
is 
in 
the 
succession, 
whereby 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
senses 
are 
connected 
just 
as 
the 
intelligible 
truths 
require. 
This 
is 
the 
difference 
which 
should 
be 
made 
between 
them; 
whereas 
that 
which 
you 
make 
here 
between 
simple 
and 
compound 
ideas, 
and 
compound 
ideas 
belonging 
to 
substances 
and 
to 
accidents, 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
well 
founded, 
since 
all 
intelligibleideashave 
their 
archetypesin 
the 
eternal 
possibilityofthings. 



CHAPTER 
V. 


Of 
truth 
in 
general. 



§§ 
1 
AND 
2. 
[1. 
What 
truth 
is. 
2. 
A 
right 
joining 
or 
separating 
of 
signs; 
i. 


e. 
ideas 
or 
words.] 
But 
what 
I 
find 
least 
to 
my 
taste 
in 
your 
definition 
of 
truth, 
is 
that 
truth 
is 
there 
sought 
in 
words. 
Thus 
the 
same 
meaning, 
being 
expressed 
in 
Latin, 
German, 
English, 
French, 
will 
not 
be 
the 
same 
truth, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
say 
with 
Hobbes, 
that 
truth 
depends 
on 
the 
good 
pleasure 
of 
men 
which 
is 
speaking 
in 
a 
very 
strange 
way. 
Truth 
is 
even 
attributed 
to 
God, 
who 
you 
will 
admit 
(I 
think) 
has 
no 
need 
of 
signs. 
Finally, 
I 
have 
been 
already 
more 
than 
once 
surprised 
at 
the 
humor 
of 
your 
friends, 
whotakepleasureinmakingessencesandspecies, 
nominal 
truths. 
We 
shall 
have 
therefore, 
farther, 
literal 
truths, 
which 
may 
be 
distinguished 
into 
truths 
of 
paper 
or 
of 
parchment, 
of 
the 
black 
of 
ordinary 
ink, 
or 
of 
printer’s 
ink, 
if 
truths 
must 
be 
distinguished 
by 
signs. 
It 
is 
better, 
therefore, 
to 
place 
truths 
in 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
objects 
of 
ideas, 
which 
causes 
one 
to 
be 
included 
or 
not 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
other. 
This 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
languages 
and 
is 
common 
to 
us 
with 
God 
and 
the 
angels; 
and 
when 
God 
manifests 
a 
truth 
to 
us 
we 
acquire 
that 
one 
which 
is 
in 
his 
understanding, 
for 
although 
there 
is 
an 
infinite 
difference 
between 
his 
ideas 
and 
ours 
as 
respects 
perfection 
and 
extension, 
it 
is 
always 
true 
that 
there 
is 
agreement 
in 
the 
same 
relation. 
It 
is 
therefore 
in 
this 
relation 
that 
truth 
must 
be 
placed, 
and 
we 
may 
distinguish 
between 
truths, 
which 
are 
independent 
of 
our 
good 
pleasure, 
and 
expressions, 
whichweinventasseems 
goodtous. 


§11. 
[Moral 
and 
metaphysical 
truth]. 
Moral 
truth 
is 
called 
veracity 
by 
some, 
and 
metaphysical 
truth 
is 
taken 
commonly 
by 
metaphysicians 
for 
an 



attribute 
of 
being, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
very 
useless 
attribute 
and 
one 
almost 
void 
of 
meaning. 
Let 
us 
content 
ourselves 
with 
seeking 
truth 
in 
the 
correspondence 
of 
propositions 
which 
are 
in 
the 
mind 
with 
the 
things 
in 
question. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
I 
have 
also 
attributed 
truth 
to 
ideas 
in 
saying 
that 
ideas 
are 
true 
or 
false; 
but 
in 
that 
case 
I 
understand 
it 
in 
fact 
of 
the 
propositions 
which 
affirm 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
object 
of 
the 
idea. 
And 
in 
this 
same 
sense 
it 
may 
be 
said 
farther 
that 
a 
being 
is 
true, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
proposition 
which 
affirms 
its 
actualoratleastpossibleexistence. 



CHAPTER 
VII. 


Of 
maxims. 



§ 
1. 
[THEY 
are 
self-evident] 
This 
investigation 
is 
very 
useful 
and 
even 
important. 
But 
you 
must 
not 
imagine, 
sir, 
that 
it 
has 
been 
entirely 
neglected. 
You 
will 
find 
in 
a 
hundred 
places 
that 
the 
scholastic 
philosophers 
have 
said 
that 
these 
propositions 
are 
evident 
ex 
terminis, 
as 
soon 
as 
their 
terms 
are 
understood; 
so 
that 
they 
were 
persuaded 
that 
the 
force 
of 
conviction 
was 
founded 
on 
the 
apprehension 
of 
the 
terms, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
connection 
of 
the 
ideas. 
But 
the 
geometricians 
have 
done 
much 
more: 
for 
they 
have 
undertaken 
very 
often 
to 
demonstrate 
them 
— 
As 
regards 
maxims, 
they 
are 
sometimes 
taken 
for 
established 
propositions, 
whether 
they 
are 
evident 
or 
not. 
This 
might 
be 
well 
for 
beginners, 
whom 
scrupulousness 
arrests; 
but 
when 
the 
establishing 
of 
science 
is 
in 
question, 
it 
is 
another 
matter. 
They 
are 
also 
often 
taken 
thus 
in 
ethics 
and 
even 
by 
the 
logicians 
in 
their 
Topics, 
in 
which 
there 
is 
an 
abundance 
of 
them, 
but 
a 
part 
of 
this 
contains 
some 
which 
are 
sufficiently 
vague 
and 
obscure. 
For 
the 
rest, 
I 
said 
publicly 
and 
privately 
a 
long 
while 
ago 
that 
it 
would 
be 
important 
to 
demonstrate 
all 
the 
secondary 
axioms 
of 
which 
we 
ordinarily 
make 
use, 
by 
reducing 
them 
to 
primitive 
or 
immediate 
and 
undemonstrable 
axioms, 
which 
are 
those 
which 
I 
called 
lately 
and 
elsewhere, 
identical 
ones. 


§ 
7. 
It 
may 
always 
be 
said 
that 
this 
proposition, 
I 
exist, 
is 
most 
evident, 
being 
a 
proposition 
which 
cannot 
be 
proved 
by 
any 
other, 
or 
an 
immediate 
truth. 
And 
to 
say, 
I 
think 
therefore 
I 
am, 
is 
not 
properly 
to 
prove 
existence 
by 
thought, 
since 
to 
think 
and 
to 
be 
thinking 
are 
the 
same 
thing; 
and 
to 
say; 
I 
am 
thinking 
is 
the 
same 
as 
to 
say, 
I 
am. 
Nevertheless 
you 
may 
exclude 
this 



proposition 
from 
the 
number 
of 
axioms 
with 
some 
justice, 
for 
it 
is 
a 
proposition 
of 
fact, 
founded 
upon 
an 
immediate 
experience, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
a 
necessary 
proposition, 
whose 
necessity 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
immediate 
agreement 
of 
ideas. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
there 
is 
no 
one 
but 
God 
who 
sees 
how 
these 
two 
terms 
I 
and 
existence 
are 
connected, 
that 
is, 
why 
I 
exist. 
But 
if 
the 
axiom 
is 
taken 
more 
generally 
for 
an 
immediate 
or 
nomprovable 
truth, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
proposition 
I 
am 
is 
an 
axiom, 
and 
in 
any 
case 
we 
may 
be 
assured 
that 
it 
is 
a 
primitive 
truth 
or 
unum 
ex 
primis 
cognitis 
inter 
terminos 
complexos, 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
first 
known 
statements, 
that 
which 
is 
understood 
in 
the 
natural 
order 
of 
our 
knowledge; 
for 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
a 
man 
may 
never 
have 
thought 
of 
forming 
expressly 
this 
proposition, 
which 
is 
yet 
innate 
in 
him. 


§§ 
8, 
9. 
I 
had 
further 
added 
that 
in 
the 
natural 
order 
to 
say 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
what 
it 
is, 
is 
prior 
to 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
not 
another; 
for 
here 
it 
is 
not 
a 
question 
of 
the 
history 
of 
our 
discoveries, 
which 
is 
different 
in 
different 
men, 
but 
of 
the 
connection 
and 
natural 
order 
of 
truths, 
which 
is 
always 
the 
same. 
But 
your 
remark, 
namely, 
that 
what 
the 
child 
sees 
is 
only 
a 
fact, 
deserves 
still 
more 
reflection; 
for 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
senses 
do 
not 
give 
absolutely 
certain 
truths 
(as 
you 
yourself 
observed, 
sir, 
not 
long 
ago), 
nor 
such 
as 
are 
free 
from 
all 
danger 
of 
illusion. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
make 
metaphysically 
possible 
fictions, 
sugar 
might 
be 
changed 
imperceptibly 
into 
a 
rod 
to 
punish 
a 
child 
if 
it 
has 
been 
naughty, 
just 
as 
water 
is 
changed 
into 
wine 
with 
us 
on 
Christmas 
Eve, 
if 
it 
has 
been 
well 
rectified 
[morigrné], 
But 
the 
pain 
(you 
will 
say) 
which 
the 
rod 
inflicts 
will 
never 
be 
the 
pleasure 
which 
the 
sugar 
gives. 
I 
reply 
that 
the 
child 
will 
think 
of 
making 
an 
express 
proposition 
concerning 
it 
as 
little 
as 
of 
remarking 
the 
axiom 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
said 
truly 
that 
what 
is, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
is 
not, 
although 
it 
may 
very 
well 
perceive 
the 
difference 



between 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
difference 
between 
perceiving 
and 
notperceiving. 


§ 
10. 
Thus 
you 
must 
not 
here 
oppose 
the 
axiom 
and 
the 
example 
as 
different 
truths 
in 
this 
respect, 
but 
regard 
the 
axiom 
as 
incorporated 
in 
the 
example 
and 
rendering 
the 
example 
true. 
It 
is 
quite 
another 
thing 
when 
the 
evidence 
is 
not 
remarked 
in 
the 
example 
itself 
and 
when 
the 
affirmation 
of 
the 
example 
is 
a 
consequence 
and 
not 
merely 
a 
subsumption 
of 
the 
universal 
proposition, 
asmayhappen 
alsoin 
respect 
toaxioms. 



CHAPTER 
IX. 


Of

A 
threefold 
knowledge 
of 
existence. 
3. 
Our

I 
am 
fully 
in 
accord 
with 
all 
this. 
And 
I 
add 
that 
the 
immediate 
apperception 
of 
our 
existence 
and 
of 
our 
thoughts 
furnishes 
us 
the 
first 
truths 
a

of 
fact, 
that 
is, 
the 
first

as 
identical 
propositions 
contain 
the 
first 
truths 
a 
priori 
or 
of 
reason, 
that 
is, 
the 
first 
lights. 
Both 
are 
incapable 
of 
being 
proved 
and 
may 
be 
called 
immediate; 
the 
former, 
because 
there 
is 
immediation 
between 
the 
understanding 
and 
its 
object, 
the 
latter, 
because 
there 
is 
immediation 
between 
thesubjectandpredicate. 



CHAPTER 
X. 


Of

§

I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
repeat 
what 
has 
been 
discussed 
between 
us 
concerning 
innate 
ideas 
and 
truths, 
among 
which 
I 
reckon

He 
knows 
also 
that

I 
assure 
you, 
sir, 
with 
perfect 
sincerity, 
that 
I 
am 
extremely 
sorry 
to 
be 
obliged 
to 
say 
anything 
against 
this 
demonstration: 
but 
I 
do 
it 
in 
order 
to 
give 
you 
an 
opportunity 
to 
fill 
up 
the 
gap 
in 
it. 
It 
is 
principally 
in 
the 
passage 
where 
you 
conclude 
(§ 
3) 
that 
something 
has 
existed 
from 
all 
eternity. 
I 
find 
ambiguity 
in 
it. 
If 
it 
means 
that 
there 
has 
never 
been 
a 
time 
when 
nothing 
existed,I 
agree 
to 
this; 
and 
it 
follows 
truly 
from 
the 
preceding 
propositions 
by 
a 
wholly 
mathematical 
sequence. 
For 
if 
there 
never 
had 
been 
anything, 
there 
would 
always 
have 
been 
nothing, 
nothing 
not 
being 
able 
to 
produce 
being; 
hence 
we 
ourselves 
would 
not 
be, 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
first 
truth 
of 
experience. 
But 
what 
follows 
shows 
first 
that 
in 
saying 
that 
something 
has 
existed 
from 
all 
eternity, 
you 
mean 
an 
eternal 
thing. 
Nevertheless 
it 
does 
not 
follow, 
in 
virtue 
of 
what 
you 
have 
advanced 
up 
to 
this 
time, 
that 
if 
there 
has 
always 
been 
something, 
it 
has 
always 
been 
a 
certain 
thing, 
that 
is, 
that 
there 
is 
an 
eternal 
being. 
For 
some 
opponents 
will 
say 
that 
I 
myself 
have 
been 
produced 
by 
other 
things 
and 
these 
things 
again 
by 
others. 
Farther, 
if 
some 
admit 
eternal 
beings 
(as 
the 
Epicureans 
their 
atoms) 
they 
will 
not 
believe 
themselves 
thereby 
obliged 
to 
grant 
an 
eternal 
being 
which 
should 
be 
alone 
the 
source 
of 



all 
others. 
For 
even 
if 
they 
should 
admit 
that 
that 
which 
gives 
existence 
gives 
also 
the 
other 
qualities 
and 
powers 
of 
a 
thing, 
they 
will 
deny 
that 
a 
single 
thing 
gives 
existence 
to 
the 
others 
and 
they 
will 
even 
say 
that 
for 
each 
thing 
several 
others 
must 
concur. 
Thus 
we 
will 
not 
arrive 
in 
this 
way 
alone 
at 
one 
source 
of 
all 
powers. 
However 
it 
is 
very 
reasonable 
to 
conclude 
that 
there 
is 
one, 
and 
even 
that 
the 
universe 
is 
governed 
with 
wisdom. 
But 
if 
one 
believes 
matter 
susceptible 
of 
feeling, 
one 
may 
be 
disposed 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
it 
may 
produce 
it. 
At 
least 
it 
will 
be 
difficult 
to 
bring 
forward 
a 
proof 
of 
it 
which 
should 
not 
show 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
matter 
is 
altogether 
incapable 
of 
it; 
and 
supposing 
that 
our 
thought 
comes 
from 
a 
thinking 
being, 
can 
it 
be 
taken 
for 
granted 
without 
having 
a 
bias 
for 
the 
demonstration, 
that 
this 
mustbeGod? 


§ 
7. 
[Our 
idea 
of 
a 
most 
perfect 
being, 
not 
the 
sole 
proof 
of 
a 
God]. 
Although 
I 
hold 
to 
innate 
ideas 
and 
particularly 
to 
that 
of 
God, 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
the 
demonstrations 
of 
the 
Cartesians 
drawn 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
are 
perfect 
— 
This 
[ontological 
argument] 
is 
not 
a 
paralogism, 
but 
it 
is 
an 
imperfect 
demonstration 
which 
supposes 
something 
which 
has 
still 
to 
be 
proved 
in 
order 
to 
render 
it 
mathematically 
evident. 
This 
is, 
that 
it 
is 
tacitly 
supposed 
that 
this 
idea 
of 
the 
all-great 
or 
all-perfect 
being 
is 
possible 
and 
implies 
no 
contradiction 
— 
The 
other 
argument 
of 
M. 
Descartes 
which 
undertakes 
to 
prove 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
because 
his 
idea 
is 
in 
our 
soul 
and 
it 
must 
have 
come 
from 
the 
original, 
is 
still 
less 
conclusive. 
For, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
this 
argument 
has 
this 
defect 
in 
common 
with 
the 
preceding, 
that 
it 
supposes 
that 
there 
is 
in 
us 
such 
an 
idea, 
that 
is, 
that 
God 
is 
possible 
— 
And, 
secondly, 
this 
same 
argument 
does 
not 
sufficiently 
prove 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
if 
we 
have 
it, 
must 
come 
from 
the 
original. 
But 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
delay 
here 
at 
present. 
You 
will 
say 
to 
me, 
sir, 
that 
recognizing 
in 
us 
the 
innate 
idea 
of 
God 
I 
ought 
not 
to 
say 
that 
we 
may 
question 
whether 
there 
is 
one. 
But 
I 



permit 
this 
doubt 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
strict 
demonstration, 
founded 
upon 
the 
idea 
alone. 
For 
one 
is 
sufficiently 
assured 
otherwise 
of 
the 
idea 
and 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God. 
And 
you 
will 
remember 
that 
I 
have 
shown 
how 
ideas 
are 
in 
us, 
not 
always 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
we 
are 
conscious 
of 
them, 
but 
always 
so 
that 
we 
may 
draw 
them 
from 
our 
own 
depths 
and 
render 
them 
perceptible. 
And 
this 
is 
also 
what 
I 
believe 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
whose 
possibility 
and 
existence 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
demonstrated 
in 
more 
than 
one 
way. 
And 
the 
Preestablished 
Harmony 
itself 
furnishes 
a 
new 
and 
incontestable 
means 
of 
doing 
so. 
I 
believe 
besides 
that 
almost 
all 
the 
means 
which 
have 
been 
employed 
to 
prove 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
are 
good, 
and 
might 
serve, 
if 
they 
were 
perfected; 
and 
I 
am 
not 
at 
all 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
one 
which 
is 
drawn 
fromtheorderofthingsis 
tobeneglected. 


§§9,10. 
[9. 
Two 
sorts 
of 
beings, 
cogitative 
and 
incogitative. 


10.

a 
cogitative]. 
I 
think 
the 
present 
reasoningthestrongestinthe 
world, 
andnotonlyexact 
but 
alsoprofoundand 
worthy 
of 
its 
author. 
I 
am 
entirely 
of 
his 
opinion 
that 
there 
is 
no 
combination 
and 
modification 
of 
parts 
of 
matter, 
however 
small 
they 
may 
be, 
which 
can 
produce 
perception; 
all 
the 
more 
that 
the 
gross 
parts 
could 
not 
give 
it 
(as 
is 
clearly 
evident), 
and 
that 
everything 
in 
the 
small 
parts 
is 
proportional 
to 
what 
may 
take 
place 
in 
the 
large 
ones. 
It 
is 
another 
important 
remark 
upon 
matter, 
which 
the 
author 
here 
makes, 
that 
it 
must 
not 
be 
taken 
for 
a 
thing 
single 
in 
number, 
or 
(as 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
say) 
for 
a 
true 
and 
perfect 
monad 
or 
unity, 
since 
it 
is 
but 
a 
mass 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
beings. 
Here 
this 
excellent 
author 
needed 
but 
one 
more 
step 
to 
reach 
my 
system. 
For 
in 
fact 
I 
give 
perception 
to 
all 
these 
infinite 
beings, 
each 
one 
of 
which 
is 
as 
an 
animal, 
endowed 
with 
a 
soul 
(or 
with 
some 
analogous 
active 
principle, 
which 
forms 
its 
true 
unity) 
together 
with 
what 
is 
necessary 
to 
this 
being 
in 
order 
to 
be 
passive, 
and 
endowed 
with 
an 
organic 
body. 
How 
these 
beings 
have 
received 

their 
nature, 
active 
and 
passive 
(that 
is, 
what 
they 
possess 
of 
immaterial 
and 
material), 
froma 
generaland 
supreme 
cause, 
because 
otherwise,asthe 
author 
well 
remarks, 
being 
independent 
each 
of 
the 
others, 
they 
could 
never 
produce 
that 
order, 
that 
harmony, 
that 
beauty, 
which 
we 
observe 
in 
nature. 
But 
this 
argument, 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
only 
of 
moral 
certainty, 
is 
brought 
to 
a 
necessity 
altogether 
metaphysical 
by 
the 
new 
hind 
of 
harmony 
which 
I 
have 
introduced, 
which 
is 
the 
preestablished 
harmony. 
For 
each 
one 
of 
these 
souls 
expressing 
in 
its 
manner 
that 
which 
takes 
place 
outside 
and 
not 
being 
able 
to 
have 
any 
influence 
on 
other 
particular 
beings, 
or 
rather, 
being 
obliged 
to 
draw 
this 
expression 
from 
the 
depths 
of 
its 
own 
nature, 
each 
one 
must 
necessarily 
have 
received 
this 
nature 
(or 
this 
internal 
reason 
of 
the 
expressions 
of 
what 
is 
external) 
from 
a 
universal 
cause 
on 
which 
all 
these 
beings 
depend, 
and 
which 
causes 
one 
to 
be 
perfectly 
in 
accord 
and 
correspondent 
with 
another; 
a 
thing 
which 
is 
not 
possible 
without 
an 
infinite 
knowledge 
and 
power, 
and 
by 
an 
artifice 
great 
in 
respect 
especially 
to 
the 
spontaneous 
agreement 
of 
the 
mechanism 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
rational 
soul. 
In 
regard 
to 
this, 
the 
illustrious 
author 
who 
made 
objections 
against 
it 
in 
his 
wonderful 
Dictionary, 
doubted 
whether 
it 
did 
not 
surpass 
all 
possible 
wisdom; 
saying 
that 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
him 
too 
great 
for 
such 
an 
effect, 
and 
he 
at 
least 
recognized 
that 
never 
had 
the 
feeble 
conceptions 
which 
we 
are 
able 
to 
have 
of 
the 
divine 
perfection, 
been 
so 
set 
in 
relief. 



CHAPTER 
XI. 


Of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
other 
things. 



§§ 
1-10. 
[IT 
is 
to 
be 
had 
only 
by 
sensation, 
etc.] 
I 
have 
already 
remarked 
in 
our 
preceding 
conversations 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
sensible 
things 
is 
proved 
by 
their 
connection, 
which 
depends 
on 
the 
intellectual 
truths 
founded 
in 
reason, 
and 
on 
the 
constant 
observations 
in 
sensible 
things 
themselves, 
even 
when 
the 
reasons 
do 
not 
appear. 
And 
as 
these 
reasons 
and 
observations 
give 
us 
the 
means 
of 
judging 
of 
the 
future 
by 
relation 
to 
our 
interests, 
and 
as 
success 
answers 
to 
our 
rational 
judgment, 
we 
could 
not 
ask 
nor 
even 
have 
a 
greater 
certainty 
concerning 
these 
objects. 
We 
can 
account 
also 
even 
for 
dreams 
and 
fortheir 
lack 
of 
connection 
with 
other 
phenomena. 
Nevertheless 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
appellation 
of 
knowledge 
and 
of 
certainty 
might 
be 
extended 
beyond 
actual 
sensations, 
since 
clearness 
and 
manifestness 
extend 
beyond, 
which 
I 
consider 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
certainty: 
and 
it 
would 
undoubtedly 
be 
folly 
to 
seriously 
doubt 
whether 
there 
are 
men 
in 
the 
world 
when 
we 
do 
not 
see 
any. 
To 
doubt 
seriously 
is 
to 
doubt 
in 
relation 
to 
practice, 
and 
certainty 
might 
be 
taken 
for 
a 
knowledge 
of 
truth 
of 
which 
one 
cannot 
doubt 
in 
relation 
to 
practice 
without 
madness; 
and 
sometimes 
it 
is 
taken 
still 
more 
generally 
and 
applied 
to 
cases 
where 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
without 
deserving 
to 
be 
greatly 
blamed. 
But 
manifestness 
would 
be 
a 
luminous 
certainty, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
where 
we 
do 
not 
doubt 
on 
account 
of 
the 
connection 
which 
we 
see 
between 
ideas. 
According 
to 
this 
definition 
of 
certainty, 
we 
are 
certain 
that 
Constantinople 
is 
in 
the 
world, 
that 
Constantine 
and 
Alexander 
the 
Great 
and 
Julius 
Cæsar 
have 
lived. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
some 
peasant 
of 
Ardennes 
might 
with 
reason 
doubt 
of 



these 
for 
want 
of 
information; 
but 
a 
man 
of 
letters 
and 
of 
the 
world 
could 
not 
doso

agreatderangementofmind. 


§ 
11. 
[Past 
existence 
known 
by 
memory.] 
It 
has 
already 
been 
remarked 
that 
our 
memory 
sometimes 
deceives 
us. 
And 
we 
believe 
it 
or 
not 
according 
as 
it 
is 
more 
or 
less 
vivid 
and 
more 
or 
less 
connected 
with 
the 
things 
which 
we 
know. 
And 
even 
when 
we 
are 
assured 
of 
the 
principal 
fact 
we 
may 
often 
question 
the 
circumstances. 


§§ 
13, 
14. 
[13. 
Particular 
propositions 
concerning 
existence 
are 
knowable. 
14. 
And 
general 
propositions 
concerning 
abstract 
ideas.] 
Your 
division 
appears 
to 
amount 
to 
mine, 
of 
propositions 
of 
fact 
and 
propositions 
of 
reason. 
Propositions 
of 
fact 
also 
may 
become 
general 
in 
a 
way, 
but 
it 
is 
by 
induction 
or 
observation; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
only 
a 
multitude 
of 
similar 
facts, 
as 
when 
it 
is 
observed 
that 
all 
quicksilver 
is 
evaporated 
by 
the 
force 
of 
fire; 
and 
this 
is 
not 
a 
perfect 
generalization 
because 
we 
do 
not 
see 
its 
necessity. 
General 
propositions 
of 
reason 
are 
necessary, 
although 
the 
reason 
also 
furnishes 
some 
which 
are 
not 
absolutely 
general 
and 
are 
only 
probable, 
as, 
for 
example, 
when 
we 
presume 
that 
an 
idea 
is 
possible 
until 
the 
contrary 
is 
discovered 
by 
a 
more 
exact 
research. 
There 
are, 
finally, 
mixed 
propositions 
which 
are 
drawn 
from 
premises, 
some 
of 
which 
come 
from 
facts 
and 
observations, 
and 
others 
are 
necessary 
propositions: 
and 
such 
are 
a 
number 
of 
geographical 
and 
astronomical 
conclusions 
concerning 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
the 
course 
of 
the 
stars, 
which 
spring 
from 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
observations 
of 
travelers 
and 
astronomers 
with 
the 
theorems 
of 
geometry 
and 
arithmetic. 
But 
as, 
according 
to 
the 
usage 
of 
logicians, 
the 
conclusion 
follows 
the 
weakest 
of 
the 
premises 
and 
cannot 
have 
more 
certainty 
than 
they, 
these 
mixed 
propositions 
have 
only 
the 
certainty 
and 
universality 
which 
belong 
to 
theobservations. 
Asregards 
eternal 
truths, 
it 
must 
be 
observed 
that 
at 
bottom 
they 
are 
all 
conditional 
and 
say 
in 
effect, 
such 
a 
thing 
posited, 
such 
another 



thing 
is. 
For 
example, 
in 
saying, 
every 
figure 
which 
has 
three 
sides 
will 
also 
have 
three 
angles, 
I 
do 
nothing 
but 
suppose 
that 
if 
there 
is 
a 
figure 
with 
three 
sides, 
this 
same 
figure 
willhave 
three 
angles.... 


The 
scholastics 
have 
disputed 
hotly 
de 
constantia 
subjecti, 
as 
they 
called 
it, 
that 
is, 
how 
the 
proposition 
made 
upon 
a 
subject 
can 
have 
a 
real 
truth 
if 
this 
subject 
does 
not 
exist. 
It 
is 
that 
the 
truth 
is 
only 
conditional 
and 
says 
that 
in 
case 
the 
subject 
ever 
exists, 
it 
will 
be 
found 
such. 
But 
it 
will 
be 
asked 
further, 
in 
what 
is 
this 
connection 
founded, 
since 
there 
is 
in 
it 
reality 
which 
doesnotdeceive? 
Thereplywillbe 
thatitisinthe 
connectionof 
ideas. 
But 
in 
answer 
it 
will 
be 
asked, 
where 
would 
these 
ideas 
be 
if 
no 
mind 
existed 
and 
then 
what 
would 
become 
of 
the 
real 
foundation 
of 
this 
certainty 
of 
the 
eternal 
truths? 
This 
leads 
us 
finally 
to 
the 
ultimate 
ground 
of 
truths, 
namely, 
to 
that 
Supreme 
and 
Universal 
Mind, 
which 
cannot 
fail 
to 
exist, 
whose 
understanding, 
to 
speak 
truly, 
is 
the 
region 
of 
eternal 
truths, 
as 
St. 
Augustine 
has 
recognized 
and 
expresses 
in 
a 
sufficiently 
vivid 
way. 
And 
in 
order 
that 
it 
be 
not 
thought 
that 
it 
is 
unnecessary 
to 
resort 
to 
this, 
we 
must 
consider 
that 
these 
necessary 
truths 
contain 
the 
determining 
reason 
and 
the 
regulative 
principle 
of 
even 
existences, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
universe. 
Thus 
thesenecessary 
truths, 
being 
anteriortothe 
existences 
of 
contingentbeings, 
it 
must 
be 
that 
they 
are 
founded 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
necessary 
substance. 
Here 
it 
is 
that 
I 
find 
the 
original 
of 
the 
ideas 
and 
truths 
which 
are 
engraved 
in 
our 
souls, 
not 
in 
the 
form 
of 
propositions, 
but 
as 
the 
sources 
from 
which 
applicationsand 
occasionswillcauseactual 
enunciationsto 
arise. 



CHAPTER 
XII. 


Of 
the 
improvement 
of 
our 
knowledge. 



§§4 
-6 
. 
[DANGEROUS 
TO 
build 
upon 
precarious 
principles. 
But 
to 
compare 
dear 
complete 
ideas 
under 
steady 
names.] 
I 
am 
surprised, 
sir, 
that 
you 
turn 
against 
maxims, 
that 
is, 
against 
evident 
principles, 
that 
which 
can 
and 
must 
be 
said 
against 
the 
principles 
supposed 
gratis. 
When 
one 
demands 
praecognita 
in 
the 
sciences, 
or 
anterior 
knowledges, 
which 
serve 
to 
ground 
science, 
he 
demands 
known 
principles 
and 
not 
arbitrary 
positions, 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
is 
not 
known; 
and 
even 
Aristotle 
understands 
that 
the 
inferior 
and 
subaltern 
sciences 
borrow 
their 
principles 
from 
other 
higher 
sciences 
where 
they 
have 
been 
demonstrated, 
except 
the 
first 
of 
the 
sciences, 
which 
we 
call 
metaphysics, 
which, 
according 
to 
him, 
asks 
nothing 
from 
the 
others 
and 
furnishes 
them 
the 
principles 
of 
which 
they 
have 
need; 
and 
when 
he 
says 
δει 
πιστευειν 
τον 
μανθανοντα, 
the 
apprentice 
must 
believe 
his 
master, 
his 
opinion 
is 
that 
he 
must 
do 
it 
only 
while 
waiting, 
while 
he 
is 
not 
yet 
instructed 
in 
the 
higher 
sciences, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
only 
provisionally. 
Thus 
one 
is 
very 
far 
from 
receiving 
gratuitous 
principles. 
To 
this 
must 
he 
added, 
that 
even 
principles 
whose 
certainty 
is 
not 
complete 
may 
have 
their 
use 
if 
we 
build 
upon 
them 
only 
by 
demonstration; 
for 
although 
all 
the 
conclusions 
in 
this 
case 
are 
only 
conditional 
and 
are 
valid 
solely 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
this 
principle 
is 
true, 
nevertheless, 
this 
connection 
itself 
and 
these 
conditional 
enunciations 
would 
at 
least 
be 
demonstrated; 
so 
that 
it 
were 
much 
to 
be 
desired 
that 
we 
had 
many 
books 
written 
in 
this 
way, 
where 
there 
would 
be 
no 
danger 
of 
error, 
the 
reader 
or 
disciple 
being 
warned 
of 
the 
condition. 
And 
practice 
will 
not 
be 
regulated 
by 
these 
conclusions 
except 
as 
the 
supposition 



shall 
be 
found 
verified 
otherwise. 
This 
method 
also 
serves 
very 
often 
itself 
to 
verify 
suppositions 
or 
hypotheses, 
when 
many 
conclusions 
arise 
from 
them, 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
is 
known 
otherwise, 
and 
sometimes 
this 
gives 
a 
perfect 
proofsufficienttodemonstratethetruthof 
the 
hypothesis. 


§ 
13. 
[The 
true 
use 
of 
hypotheses.] 
The 
art 
of 
discovering 
the 
causes 
of 
phenomena, 
or 
true 
hypotheses, 
is 
like 
the 
art 
of 
deciphering, 
where 
an 
ingenious 
conjecture 
often 
shortens 
the 
road 
very 
much. 
Lord 
Bacon 
began 
to 
put 
the 
art 
of 
experimenting 
into 
precepts, 
and 
Sir 
Robert 
Boyle 
had 
a 
great 
talent 
for 
practising 
it. 
But 
if 
the 
art 
of 
employing 
experiences 
and 
of 
drawing 
consequences 
therefrom 
is 
not 
joined 
to 
it, 
we 
shall 
never 
with 
the 
utmost 
cost 
attain 
to 
what 
a 
man 
of 
great 
penetration 
might 
discover 
in 
the 
first 
place. 
Descartes, 
who 
was 
assuredly 
such, 
has 
made 
a 
similar 
remark, 
in 
one 
of 
his 
letters, 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
method 
of 
the 
Chancellor 
of 
England; 
and 
Spinoza 
(whom 
I 
do 
not 
hesitate 
to 
quote 
when 
he 
says 
something 
good), 
in 
one 
of 
his 
letters 
to 
the 
late 
M. 
Oldenbourg, 
Secretary 
of 
the 
Royal 
Society 
of 
England, 
printed 
among 
the 
posthumous 
works 
of 
this 
subtle 
Jew, 
makes 
a 
like 
reflection 
concerning 
a 
work 
by 
Mr. 
Boyle, 
who, 
to 
speak 
the 
truth, 
stops 
a 
little 
too 
much 
to 
draw 
from 
a 
number 
of 
fine 
experiences 
no 
other 
conclusion 
than 
this 
which 
he 
might 
take 
for 
a 
principle, 
namely, 
that 
everything 
takes 
place 
in 
nature 
mechanically; 
a 
principle 
which 
can 
be 
rendered 
certain 
by 
reason 
alone 
and 
never 
by 
experiences 
however 
numerousthey 
maybe. 



Theodicy 
(1710) 



Original 
Title: 
‘Essais 
de 
Théodicée 
sur 
la 
bonté 
de 
Dieu, 
la 
liberté 
de 
l’homme 
et 
l’origine 
du 
mal’ 


Translated 
by 
E. 
M. 
Huggard, 
1890 


Originally 
titled 
‘Essays 
of 
Theodicy 
on 
the 
Goodness 
of 
God, 
the 
Freedom 
of 
Man 
and 
the 
Origin 
of 
Evil’, 
this 
book 
is 
widely 
considered 
Leibniz’ 
most 
important 
work 
and 
was 
in 
fact 
the 
only 
book 
he 
published 
during 
his 
lifetime. 
First 
published 
in 
1710, 
it 
introduced 
the 
term 
‘theodicy’. 
Its 
optimistic 
approach 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
evil 
is 
thought 
to 
have 
inspired 
Voltaire’s 
satirical 
attack 
in 
Candide. 
In 
the 
philosophy 
of 
religion, 
a 
theodicy 
means 
a 
‘vindication 
of 
God’, 
from 
Ancient 
Greek 
θεός 
“god” 
and 
δίκη 
“justice”. 
Leibniz’ 
argument 
attempts 
to 
resolve 
the 
problem 
of 
evil 
that 
arises 
when 
all 
power 
and 
all 
goodness 
are 
simultaneously 
ascribed 
to 
God. 
Unlike 
a 
defence, 
which 
only 
tries 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
coexistence 
of 
God 
and 
evil 
is 
logically 
possible, 
a 
theodicy 
additionally 
provides 
a 
framework 
wherein 
Godandevil’s 
existenceisconsideredplausible. 


Much 
of 
the 
Leibniz’ 
book 
consists 
of 
a 
response 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
French 
philosopher 
Pierre 
Bayle 
(1647-1706), 
who 
is 
best 
known 
for 
his 
Historical 
and 
Critical 
Dictionary 
(1697). 
Bayle 
had 
argued 
that 
there 
is 
no 
defensible 
rational 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
why 
God 
permits 
evil. 
Bayle 
suggested 
that 
powerful 
philosophical 
arguments 
can 
be 
given 
against 
a 
number 
of 
orthodox 
Christian 
teachings, 
including 
the 
goodness, 
justice 
and 
freedom 
of 
God. 
Leibniz 
responds 
to 
Bayle’s 
arguments 
in 
detail, 
arguing 
that 
it 
can 
be 
proved 
that 
God 
is 
an 
infinitely 
perfect 
being 
and 
that 
such 
a 
being 
must 
have 
created 
a 
world 
that 
has 
the 
greatest 
possible 
balance 
of 



good 
over 
evil— 
“the 
best 
of 
all 
possible 
worlds”. 
Theodicy 
is 
also 
loosely 
based 
on 
the 
Leibniz’ 
conversation 
with 
Sophia 
Charlotte 
of 
Hanover, 
with 
whom 
hecarriedonadebateformanyyears. 


Leibniz 
distinguishes 
three 
forms 
of 
evil: 
moral, 
physical 
and 
metaphysical. 
Moral 
evil 
is 
sin, 
physical 
evil 
is 
pain, 
and 
metaphysical 
evil 
is 
limitation. 
God 
permits 
moral 
and 
physical 
evil 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
greater 
goods 
and 
metaphysical 
evil 
(i.e. 
limitation) 
is 
unavoidable 
since 
any 
created 
universe 
must 
necessarily 
fall 
short 
of 
God’s 
absolute 
perfection. 
Human 
free 
will 
is 
consistent 
with 
God’s 
foreknowledge, 
because 
even 
though 
all 
events 
in 
theuniverse 
are 
foreseen 
and 
pre-determined,theyare 
notnecessitated 
(i.e. 
logically 
necessary), 
and 
only 
if 
human 
choices 
were 
necessitated 
would 
free 
willbe 
anillusion. 


Against 
Bayle’s 
claims 
that 
it 
is 
unjust 
for 
God 
to 
damn 
unbaptised 
infants 
or 
adult 
non-Christians 
that 
had 
lived 
as 
well 
as 
they 
could, 
Leibniz 
denies 
that 
Christian 
teaching 
supports 
such 
claims.

EDITOR’SINTRODUCTION 



I 


Leibniz 
was 
above 
all 
things 
a 
metaphysician. 
That 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
his 
head 
was 
in 
the 
clouds, 
or 
that 
the 
particular 
sciences 
lacked 
interest 
for 
him. 
Not 
at 
all 
— 
he 
felt 
a 
lively 
concern 
for 
theological 
debate, 
he 
was 
a 
mathematician 
of 
the 
first 
rank, 
he 
made 
original 
contributions 
to 
physics, 
he 
gave 
a 
realistic 
attention 
to 
moral 
psychology. 
But 
he 
was 
incapable 
of 
looking 
at 
the 
objects 
of 
any 
special 
enquiry 
without 
seeing 
them 
as 
aspects 
or 
parts 
of 
one 
intelligible 
universe. 
He 
strove 
constantly 
after 
system, 
and 
the 
instrument 
on 
which 
his 
effort 
relied 
was 
the 
speculative 
reason. 
He 
embodied 
in 
an 
extreme 
form 
the 
spirit 
of 
his 
age. 
Nothing 
could 
be 
less 
like 
the 
spirit 
of 
ours. 
To 
many 
people 
now 
alive 
metaphysics 
means 
a 
body 
of 
wild 
and 
meaningless 
assertions 
resting 
on 
spurious 
argument. 
A 
professor 
of 
metaphysics 
may 
nowadays 
be 
held 
to 
deal 
handsomely 
with 
the 
duties 
of 
his 
chair 
if 
he 
is 
prepared 
to 
handle 
metaphysical 
statements 
at 
all, 
though 
it 
be 
only 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
getting 
rid 
of 
them, 
by 
showing 
them 
up 
as 
confused 
forms 
of 
something 
else. 
A 
chair 
in 
metaphysical 
philosophy 
becomes 
analogous 
to 
a 
chair 
in 
tropical 
diseases: 
what 
is 
taught 
from 
it 
is 
not 
the 
propagationbutthecure. 


Confidence 
in 
metaphysical 
construction 
has 
ebbed 
and 
flowed 
through 
philosophical 
history; 
periods 
of 
speculation 
have 
been 
followed 
by 
periods 
of 
criticism. 
The 
tide 
will 
flow 
again, 
but 
it 
has 
not 
turned 
yet, 
and 
such 
metaphysicians 
assurvivescarcely 
venture 
further 
thanto 
argueacaseforthe 
possibility 
of 
their 
art. 
It 
would 
be 
an 
embarrassing 
task 
to 
open 
an 
approach 
to 
Leibnitian 
metaphysics 
from 
the 
present 
metaphysical 
position, 
if 
there 
is 
a 



present 
position. 
If 
we 
want 
an 
agreed 
starting-point, 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
historical. 


The 
historical 
importance 
of 
Leibniz’ 
ideas 
is 
anyhow 
unmistakable. 
If 
metaphysical 
thinking 
is 
nonsensical, 
its 
empire 
over 
the 
human 
imagination 
must 
still 
be 
confessed; 
if 
itis 
as 
chimerical 
a 
science 
as 
alchemy, 
it 
is 
no 
less 
fertile 
in 
by-products 
of 
importance. 
And 
if 
we 
are 
to 
consider 
Leibniz 
historically, 
we 
cannot 
do 
better 
than 
take 
up 
his 
Theodicy, 
for 
two 
reasons. 
It 
was 
the 
only 
one 
of 
his 
main 
philosophical 
works 
to 
be 
published 
in 
his 
lifetime, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
a 
principal 
means 
of 
his 
direct 
influence; 
the 
Leibniz 
his 
own 
age 
knew 
was 
the 
Leibniz 
of 
the 
Theodicy. 
Then 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
the 
Theodicy 
itself 
is 
peculiarly 
rich 
in 
historical 
material. 
It 
reflects 
the 
world 
of 
men 
and 
books 
which 
Leibniz 
knew; 
it 
expresses 
the 
theological 
setting 
of 
metaphysical 
speculation 
which 
still 
predominated 
in 
the 
first 
years 
oftheeighteenthcentury. 


Leibniz 
is 
remembered 
for 
his 
philosophy; 
he 
was 
not 
a 
professional 
philosopher. 
He 
was 
offered 
academic 
chairs, 
but 
he 
declined 
them. 
He 
was 
a 
gentleman, 
a 
person 
of 
means, 
librarian 
to 
a 
reigning 
prince, 
and 
frequently 
employed 
in 
state 
affairs 
of 
trust 
and 
importance. 
The 
librarian 
might 
at 
any 
moment 
become 
the 
political 
secretary, 
and 
offer 
his 
own 
contributions 
to 
policy. 
Leibniz 
was 
for 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
his 
active 
life 
the 
learned 
and 
confidential 
servant 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Brunswick; 
when 
the 
Duke 
had 
nothing 
better 
to 
do 
with 
him, 
he 
set 
him 
to 
research 
into 
ducal 
history. 
If 
Leibniz 
had 
a 
profession 
in 
literature, 
it 
was 
history 
rather 
than 
philosophy. 
He 
was 
even 
more 
closely 
bound 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
prince 
than 
John 
Locke 
was 
to 
those 
of 
the 
Prince 
of 
Orange. 
The 
Houses 
of 
Orange 
and 
of 
Brunswick 
were 
on 
the 
same 
side 
in 
the 
principal 
contest 
which 
divided 
Europe, 
the 
battle 
between 
Louis 
XIV 
and 
his 
enemies. 
It 
was 
a 
turning-point 
of 
the 
struggle 
when 
the 
Prince 
of 
Orange 
supplanted 
Louis’s 
Stuart 
friends 
on 
the 
English 



throne. 
It 
was 
a 
continuation 
of 
the 
same 
movement, 
when 
Leibniz’ 
master, 
George 
I, 
succeeded 
to 
the 
same 
throne, 
and 
frustrated 
the 
restoration 
of 
the 
Stuart 
heir. 
Locke 
returned 
to 
England 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
Prince 
of 
Orange, 
and 
became 
the 
representative 
thinker 
of 
the 
régime. 
Leibniz 
wished 
to 
come 
to 
the 
English 
court 
of 
George 
I, 
but 
was 
unkindly 
ordered 
to 
attend 
to 
the 
duties 
of 
his 
librarianship. 
So 
he 
remained 
in 
Hanover. 
He 
was 
then 
an 
old 
man, 
andbeforethe 
tideof 
favourhad 
turned,he 
died. 


Posterity 
has 
reckoned 
Locke 
and 
Leibniz 
the 
heads 
of 
rival 
sects, 
but 
politically 
they 
were 
on 
the 
same 
side. 
As 
againstLouis’s 
political 
absolutism 
and 
enforced 
religious 
uniformity, 
both 
championed 
religious 
toleration 
and 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
mind. 
Their 
theological 
liberalism 
was 
political 
prudence; 
it 
was 
not 
necessarily 
for 
that 
reason 
the 
less 
personally 
sincere. 
They 
had 
too 
much 
wisdom 
to 
meet 
bigotry 
with 
bigotry, 
or 
set 
Protestant 
intolerance 
against 
Catholic 
absolutism. 
But 
they 
had 
too 
much 
sympathy 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
Europe 
to 
react 
into 
free 
thinking 
or 
to 
make 
a 
frontal 
attack 
on 
revealed 
truth. 
They 
took 
their 
stand 
on 
a 
fundamental 
Christian 
theism, 
the 
common 
religion 
of 
all 
good 
men; 
they 
repudiated 
the 
negative 
enormities 
of 
Hobbes 
and 
Spinoza. 


The 
Christian 
was 
to 
hold 
a 
position 
covered 
by 
three 
lines 
of 
defences. 
The 
base 
line 
was 
to 
be 
the 
substance 
of 
Christian 
theism 
and 
of 
Christian 
morals, 
and 
it 
was 
to 
be 
held 
by 
the 
forces 
of 
sheer 
reason, 
without 
aid 
from 
scriptural 
revelation. 
The 
middle 
line 
was 
laid 
down 
by 
the 
general 
sense 
of 
Scripture, 
and 
the 
defence 
of 
it 
was 
this. 
‘Scriptural 
doctrine 
is 
reconcilable 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
sheer 
reason, 
but 
it 
goes 
beyond 
them. 
We 
believe 
the 
Scriptures, 
because 
they 
are 
authenticated 
by 
marks 
of 
supernatural 
intervention 
in 
the 
circumstances 
of 
their 
origin. 
We 
believe 
them, 
but 
reason 
controlsour 
interpretationofthem.’ 
There 
remained 
the 
most 
forward 
and 
the 
most 
hazardous 
line: 
the 
special 
positions 
which 
a 
Church, 
a 
sect, 
or 
an 



individual 
might 
found 
upon 
the 
scriptural 
revelation. 
A 
prudent 
man 
would 
not 
hold 
his 
advance 
positions 
in 
the 
same 
force 
or 
defend 
them 
with 
the 
same 
obstinacy 
as 
either 
of 
the 
lines 
behind 
them. 
He 
could 
argue 
for 
them, 
buthecouldnotrequireassent 
tothem. 


One 
cannot 
help 
feeling, 
indeed, 
the 
readiness 
of 
these 
writers 
to 
fall 
back, 
not 
only 
from 
the 
front 
line 
to 
the 
middle 
line, 
but 
from 
the 
middle 
line 
itself 
to 
the 
base 
line. 
Leibniz, 
for 
example, 
writes 
with 
perfect 
seriousness 
and 
decency 
about 
the 
Christian 
scheme 
of 
redemption, 
but 
it 
hardly 
looks 
like 
beingforhimacrucialdeliverancefromperdition. 
Itisnottheinterventionof 
Mercy, 
by 
which 
alone 
He 
possesses 
himself 
of 
us: 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
ways 
in 
which 
supreme 
Benevolence 
carries 
out 
a 
cosmic 
policy; 
and 
God’s 
benevolenceisknownbypurereason,andapartfromChristianrevelation. 


In 
one 
politically 
important 
particular 
the 
theological 
attitude 
of 
Leibniz 
differed 
from 
that 
of 
Locke. 
Both 
stood 
for 
toleration 
and 
for 
the 
minimizing 
of 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
sects. 
This 
was 
a 
serious 
enough 
matter 
in 
England, 
but 
it 
was 
an 
even 
more 
serious 
matter 
in 
Germany. 
For 
Germany 
was 
divided 
between 
Catholics 
and 
Protestants; 
effective 
toleration 
must 
embrace 
them 
both. 
English 
toleration 
might 
indulge 
a 
harmless 
Catholic 
minority, 
while 
rejecting 
the 
Catholic 
régime 
as 
the 
embodiment 
of 
intolerance. 
But 
this 
was 
not 
practical 
politics 
on 
the 
Continent; 
you 
must 
tolerate 
Catholicism 
on 
an 
equal 
footing, 
and 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
Catholic 
régimes. 
Leibniz 
was 
not 
going 
to 
damn 
the 
Pope 
with 
true 
Protestant 
fervour. 
It 
was 
his 
consistent 
aim 
to 
show 
that 
his 
theological 
principles 
were 
as 
serviceable 
to 
Catholic 
thinkers 
as 
to 
the 
doctors 
of 
his 
own 
church. 
On 
some 
points, 
indeed, 
he 
found 
his 
most 
solid 
support 
from 
Catholics; 
in 
other 
places 
there 
are 
hints 
of 
a 
joint 
Catholic-Lutheran 
front 
against 
Calvinism. 
But 
on 
the 
whole 
Leibniz’ 
writings 
suggest 
that 
the 
important 
decisions 
cut 
across 
all 
theChurches,and 
not 
betweenthem. 



Leibniz 
was 
impelled 
to 
a 
compromise 
with 
‘popery’, 
not 
only 
by 
the 
religious 
divisions 
of 
Germany, 
but 
(at 
one 
stage) 
by 
the 
political 
weakness 
of 
the 
German 
Protestant 
States. 
At 
the 
point 
of 
Louis 
XIV’s 
highest 
success, 
the 
Protestant 
princes 
had 
no 
hope 
but 
in 
Catholic 
Austria, 
and 
Austria 
was 
distracted 
by 
Turkish 
pressure 
in 
the 
rear. 
Leibniz 
hoped 
to 
relieve 
the 
situation 
by 
preaching 
a 
crusade. 
Could 
not 
the 
Christian 
princes 
sink 
their 
differences 
and 
unite 
against 
the 
infidel? 
And 
could 
not 
the 
Christian 
alliance 
be 
cemented 
by 
theological 
agreement? 
Hence 
Leibniz’ 
famous 
negotiation 
with 
Bossuet 
for 
a 
basis 
of 
Catholic-Lutheran 
concord. 
It 
was 
plainly 
destined 
to 
fail; 
and 
it 
was 
bound 
to 
recoil 
upon 
its 
author. 
How 
could 
he 
be 
a 
true 
Protestant 
who 
treated 
the 
differences 
with 
the 
Catholics 
as 
nonessentials? 
How 
could 
he 
have 
touched 
pitch 
and 
taken 
no 
defilement? 
Leibniz 
was 
generally 
admired, 
but 
he 
was 
not 
widely 
trusted. 
As 
a 
mere 
politician,hemaybejudgedtohaveover-reachedhimself. 


It 
has 
been 
the 
object 
of 
the 
preceding 
paragraphs 
to 
show 
that 
Leibniz 
the 
politician 
and 
Leibniz 
the 
theologian 
were 
one 
and 
the 
same 
person; 
not 
at 
all 
to 
suggest 
that 
his 
rational 
theology 
was 
just 
political 
expediency. 
We 
may 
apply 
to 
him 
a 
parody 
of 
his 
own 
doctrine, 
the 
pre-established 
harmony 
between 
nature 
and 
grace. 
Everything 
happens 
as 
though 
Leibniz 
were 
a 
liberal 
politician, 
and 
his 
theology 
expressed 
his 
politics. 
Yes, 
but 
equally, 
everything 
happens 
as 
though 
Leibniz 
were 
a 
philosophical 
theologian, 
and 
his 
politics 
expressed 
his 
theology. 
His 
appreciation 
of 
Catholic 
speculation 
was 
natural 
and 
sincere; 
his 
dogmatic 
ancestry 
is 
to 
be 
looked 
for 
in 
Thomism 
and 
Catholic 
humanism 
as 
much 
as 
anywhere. 
Above 
all, 
he 
had 
himself 
a 
liberal 
and 
generous 
mind. 
It 
gave 
him 
pleasure 
to 
appreciate 
good 
whereverhecouldseeit,and 
todiscover 
asouloftruthinevery 
opinion. 


From 
the 
moment 
when 
Leibniz 
became 
aware 
of 
himself 
as 
an 
independent 
thinker, 
he 
was 
the 
man 
of 
a 
doctrine. 
Sometimes 
he 
called 
it 



‘my 
principles’, 
sometimes 
‘the 
new 
system’, 
sometimes 
‘pre-established 
harmony’. 
It 
could 
be 
quite 
briefly 
expressed; 
he 
was 
always 
ready 
to 
oblige 
his 
friends 
with 
a 
summary 
statement, 
either 
in 
a 
letter 
or 
an 
enclosed 
memorandum, 
and 
several 
such 
have 
come 
down 
to 
us. 
The 
doctrine 
may 
have 
been 
in 
Leibniz’ 
view 
simple, 
but 
it 
was 
applicable 
to 
every 
department 
of 
human 
speculation 
or 
enquiry. 
It 
provided 
a 
new 
alphabet 
of 
philosophical 
ideas, 
and 
everything 
in 
heaven 
and 
earth 
could 
be 
expressed 
in 
it; 
not 
only 
could 
be, 
but 
ought 
to 
be, 
and 
Leibniz 
showed 
tireless 
energy 
in 
working 
out 
restatements 
ofstanding 
problems. 


As 
a 
man 
with 
an 
idea, 
with 
a 
philosophical 
nostrum, 
Leibniz 
may 
be 
compared 
to 
Bishop 
Berkeley. 
There 
was 
never 
any 
more 
doubt 
that 
Leibniz 
was 
a 
Leibnitian 
than 
that 
Berkeley 
was 
a 
Berkeleian. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
comparison 
between 
the 
two 
men 
in 
the 
width 
of 
their 
range. 
About 
many 
things 
Berkeley 
never 
took 
the 
trouble 
to 
Berkeleianize. 
To 
take 
the 
most 
surprising 
instance 
of 
his 
neglect 
— 
he 
assured 
the 
world 
that 
his 
whole 
doctrine 
pointed 
to, 
and 
hung 
upon, 
theology. 
But 
what 
sort 
of 
a 
theology? 
He 
scarcely 
took 
the 
first 
steps 
in 
the 
formulation 
of 
it. 
He 
preferred 
to 
keep 
on 
defending 
and 
explaining 
his 
esse 
est 
percipi. 
With 
Leibniz 
it 
is 
wholly 
different; 
he 
carries 
his 
new 
torch 
into 
every 
corner, 
to 
illuminate 
the 
dark 
questions. 


The 
wide 
applicability 
of 
pre-established 
harmony 
might 
come 
home 
to 
its 
inventor 
as 
a 
rich 
surprise. 
The 
reflective 
historian 
will 
find 
it 
less 
surprising, 
forhewill 
suspectthattheapplicationswerein 
viewfromthestart. 
Whatwas 
Leibniz 
thinking 
of 
when 
the 
new 
principle 
flashed 
upon 
him? 
What 
was 
he 
not 
thinking 
of? 
He 
had 
a 
many-sided 
mind. 
If 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
principle 
were 
complex, 
little 
wonder 
that 
its 
applications 
were 
manifold. 
Every 
expositor 
of 
Leibniz 
who 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
be 
endlessly 
tedious 
must 
concentrate 
attention 
on 
one 
aspect 
of 
Leibniz’ 
principle, 
and 
one 
source 
of 



its 
origin. 
We 
will 
here 
give 
an 
account 
of 
the 
matter 
which, 
we 
trust, 
will 
go 
most 
directly 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
it, 
but 
we 
will 
make 
no 
claims 
to 
sufficient 
interpretationof 
Leibniz’ 
thought-processes. 


Leibniz, 
then, 
like 
all 
the 
philosophers 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
was 
reforming 
scholasticism 
in 
the 
light 
of 
a 
new 
physical 
science. 
The 
science 
was 
mathematical 
in 
its 
form, 
mechanistical 
in 
its 
doctrine, 
and 
unanswerable 
in 
its 
evidence 
— 
it 
got 
results. 
But 
it 
was 
metaphysically 
intractable, 
and 
the 
doctrines 
of 
infinite 
and 
finite 
substance 
which 
it 
generated 
furnish 
a 
gallery 
of 
metaphysical 
grotesques; 
unless 
we 
are 
to 
except 
Leibniz; 
his 
system 
is, 
if 
nothing 
else, 
a 
miracle 
of 
ingenuity, 
and 
there 
are 
moments 
when 
we 
are 
in 
dangerof 
believingit. 


It 
is 
a 
natural 
mistake 
for 
the 
student 
of 
seventeenth-century 
thought 
to 
underestimate 
the 
tenacity 
of 
scholastic 
Aristotelianism. 
Descartes, 
we 
all 
know, 
was 
reared 
in 
it, 
but 
then 
Descartes 
overthrew 
it; 
and 
he 
had 
done 
his 
work 
and 
died 
by 
the 
time 
that 
Leibniz 
was 
of 
an 
age 
to 
philosophize 
at 
all. 
We 
expect 
to 
see 
Leibniz 
starting 
on 
his 
shoulders 
and 
climbing 
on 
from 
there. 
We 
are 
disappointed. 
Leibniz 
himself 
tells 
us 
that 
he 
was 
raised 
in 
the 
scholastic 
teaching. 
His 
acquaintance 
with 
Descartes’s 
opinions 
was 
secondhand, 
and 
they 
were 
retailed 
to 
him 
only 
that 
they 
might 
be 
derided. 
He 
agreed, 
likeanamiableyouth,withhispreceptors. 


The 
next 
phase 
of 
his 
development 
gave 
him 
a 
direct 
knowledge 
of 
Cartesian 
writings, 
and 
of 
other 
modern 
books 
beside, 
such 
as 
those 
of 
the 
atomist 
Gassendi. 
He 
was 
delighted 
with 
what 
he 
read, 
because 
of 
its 
fertility 
in 
the 
field 
of 
physics 
and 
mathematics; 
and 
for 
a 
short 
time 
he 
was 
an 
enthusiastic 
modern. 
But 
presently 
he 
became 
dissatisfied. 
The 
new 
systems 
did 
not 
go 
far 
enough, 
they 
were 
still 
scientifically 
inadequate. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
they 
went 
too 
far, 
and 
carried 
metaphysical 
paradox 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
humancredulity. 



There 
is 
no 
mystery 
about 
Leibniz’ 
scientific 
objections 
to 
the 
new 
philosophers. 
If 
he 
condemned 
them 
here, 
it 
was 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
scientific 
thought 
and 
observation. 
Descartes’s 
formulation 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
could, 
for 
example, 
be 
refuted 
by 
physical 
experiment; 
and 
if 
his 
general 
view 
of 
physical 
nature 
was 
bound 
up 
with 
it, 
then 
so 
much 
the 
worse 
for 
the 
Cartesian 
philosophy. 
But 
whence 
came 
Leibniz’ 
more 
strictly 
metaphysical 
objections? 
Where 
had 
he 
learned 
that 
standard 
of 
metaphysical 
adequacy 
which 
showed 
up 
the 
inadequacy 
of 
the 
new 
metaphysicians? 
His 
own 
disciples 
might 
be 
satisfied 
to 
reply, 
that 
he 
learnt 
it 
from 
Reason 
herself; 
but 
the 
answer 
will 
not 
pass 
with 
us. 
Leibniz 
reasoned, 
indeed, 
but 
he 
did 
not 
reason 
from 
nowhere, 
nor 
would 
he 
have 
got 
anywhere 
if 
he 
had. 
His 
conception 
of 
metaphysical 
reason 
was 
what 
his 
early 
scholastic 
training 
had 
madeit. 


There 
are 
certain 
absurd 
opinions 
which 
we 
are 
sure 
we 
have 
been 
taught, 
although, 
when 
put 
to 
it, 
we 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
name 
the 
teacher. 
Among 
them 
is 
something 
of 
this 
sort. 
‘Leibniz 
was 
a 
scholarly 
and 
sympathetic 
thinker. 
He 
had 
more 
sense 
of 
history 
than 
his 
contemporaries, 
and 
he 
was 
instinctively 
eclectic. 
He 
believed 
he 
could 
learn 
something 
from 
each 
of 
his 
great 
predecessors. 
We 
see 
him 
reaching 
back 
to 
cull 
a 
notion 
from 
Plato 
or 
from 
Aristotle; 
he 
even 
found 
something 
of 
use 
in 
the 
scholastics. 
In 
particular, 
he 
picked 
out 
the 
Aristotelian 
“entelechy” 
to 
stop 
a 
gap 
in 
the 
philosophy 
of 
his 
own 
age.’ 
What 
this 
form 
of 
statement 
ignores 
is 
that 
Leibniz 
was 
a 
scholastic: 
a 
scholastic 
endeavouring, 
like 
Descartes 
before 
him, 
to 
revolutionize 
scholasticism. 
The 
word 
‘entelechy’ 
was, 
indeed, 
a 
piece 
of 
antiquity 
which 
Leibniz 
revived, 
butthe 
thing 
for 
which 
it 
stoodwasthe 
most 
familiar 
of 
current 
scholastic 
conceptions. 
‘Entelechy’ 
means 
active 
principle 
of 
wholeness 
or 
completion 
in 
an 
individual 
thing. 
Scholasticism 
was 
content 



to 
talk 
about 
it 
under 
the 
name 
of 
‘substantial 
form’ 
or 
‘formal 
cause’. 
But 
the 
scholastic 
interpretation 
of 
the 
idea 
was 
hopelessly 
discredited 
by 
the 
new 
science, 
and 
the 
scholastic 
terms 
shared 
the 
discredit 
of 
scholastic 
doctrine. 
Leibniz 
wanted 
a 
term 
with 
a 
more 
general 
sound. 
‘There 
is 
an 
X’, 
he 
wanted 
to 
say, 
‘which 
scholasticism 
has 
defined 
as 
substantial 
form, 
but 
I 
am 
going 
to 
give 
a 
new 
definition 
of 
it.’ 
Entelechy 
was 
a 
useful 
name 
for 
X, 
the 
more 
soas 
ithadtheauthorityof 
Aristotle,themasterof 
scholasticism. 


Under 
the 
name 
of 
entelechy 
Leibniz 
was 
upholding 
the 
soul 
of 
scholastic 
doctrine, 
while 
retrenching 
the 
limbs 
and 
outward 
flourishes. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
substantial 
form 
which 
he 
learnt 
in 
his 
youth 
had 
had 
something 
in 
it; 
he 
could 
not 
settle 
down 
in 
the 
principles 
of 
Descartes 
or 
of 
Gassendi, 
because 
both 
ignored 
this 
vital 
something. 
Since 
the 
requirements 
of 
a 
new 
science 
would 
not 
allow 
a 
return 
to 
sheer 
scholasticism, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
find 
a 
fresh 
philosophy, 
in 
which 
entelechy 
and 
mechanism 
might 
be 
accommodated 
sidebyside. 


If 
one 
had 
asked 
any 
‘modern’ 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
to 
name 
the 
‘ancient’ 
doctrine 
he 
most 
abominated, 
he 
would 
most 
likely 
have 
replied, 
‘Substantialform’. 
Let 
usrecall

The 
medieval 
account 
of 
physical 
nature 
had 
been 
dominated 
by 
what 
we 
may 
call 
common-sense 
biology. 
Biology, 
indeed, 
is 
the 
science 
of 
the 
living, 
and 
the 
medievals 
were 
no 
more 
inclined 
than 
we 
are 
to 
endow 
all 
physical 
bodies 
with 
life. 
What 
they 
did 
do 
was 
to 
take 
living 
bodies 
as 
typical, 
and 
to 
treat 
other 
bodies 
as 
imperfectly 
analogous 
to 
them. 
Such 
an 
approach 
was 
a 
priori 
reasonable 
enough. 
For 
we 
may 
be 
expected 
to 
know 
best 
the 
physical 
being 
closest 
to 
our 
own; 
and 
we, 
at 
any 
rate, 
are 
alive. 
Why 
not 
argue 
from 
the 
better 
known 
to 
the 
less 
known, 
from 
the 
nearer 
to 
the 
more 
remote, 
interpreting 
other 
things 
by 
the 
formula 
of 
our 
own 
being, 
and 
allowing 
whateverdiscountisnecessaryfortheirdegreeofunlikenesstous? 



Common-sense 
biology 
reasons 
as 
follows. 
In 
a 
living 
body 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
pattern 
of 
organized 
parts, 
a 
certain 
rhythm 
of 
successive 
motions, 
and 
acertain 
rangeof 
characteristicactivities. 
The 
pattern,thesheeranatomy, 
is 
basic; 
but 
it 
cannot 
long 
continue 
to 
exist 
(outside 
a 
refrigerator) 
without 
accompanying 
vital 
rhythms 
in 
heart, 
respiration 
and 
digestion. 
Nor 
do 
these 
perform 
their 
parts 
without 
the 
intermittent 
support 
of 
variable 
but 
still 
characteristic 
activities: 
dogs 
not 
only 
breathe 
and 
digest, 
they 
run 
about, 
hunt 
their 
food, 
look 
for 
mates, 
bark 
at 
cats, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
anatomical 
pattern, 
the 
vital 
rhythm, 
and 
the 
characteristic 
acts 
together 
express 
dogginess; 
they 
reveal 
the 
specific 
form 
of 
the 
dog. 
They 
reveal 
it; 
exactly 
what 
the 
specific 
form 
consisted 
in 
was 
the 
subject 
of 
much 
medieval 
speculation. 
Itneednotconcernushere. 


Taking 
the 
form 
of 
the 
species 
for 
granted, 
common-sense 
biology 
proceeds 
to 
ask 
how 
it 
comes 
to 
be 
in 
a 
given 
instance, 
say 
in 
the 
dog 
Toby. 
Before 
this 
dog 
was 
born 
or 
thought 
of, 
his 
form 
or 
species 
was 
displayed 
in 
each 
of 
his 
parents. 
And 
now 
it 
looks 
as 
though 
the 
form 
of 
dog 
had 
detached 
itself 
from 
them 
through 
the 
generative 
act, 
and 
set 
up 
anew 
on 
its 
own 
account. 
How 
does 
it 
do 
that? 
By 
getting 
hold 
of 
some 
materials 
in 
which 
to 
express 
itself. 
At 
first 
it 
takes 
them 
from 
the 
body 
of 
the 
mother, 
afterwards 
it 
collects 
them 
from 
a 
wider 
environment, 
and 
what 
the 
dog 
eats 
becomes 
the 
dog. 


What, 
then, 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
assimilated 
materials 
to 
the 
dog-form 
which 
assimilates 
them? 
Before 
assimilation, 
they 
have 
their 
own 
form. 
Before 
the 
dog 
eats 
the 
leg 
of 
mutton, 
it 
has 
the 
form 
given 
to 
it 
by 
its 
place 
in 
the 
body 
of 
a 
sheep. 
What 
happens 
to 
the 
mutton? 
Is 
it 
without 
remainder 
transubstantiated 
from 
sheep 
into 
dog? 
It 
loses 
all 
its 
distinctively 
sheep-like 
characteristicsm 
but 
there 
may 
be 
some 
more 
basically 
material 
characteristics 
which 
it 
preserves. 
They 
underlay 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
mutton, 



and 
they 
continue 
to 
underlie 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
dog’s 
flesh 
which 
supplants 
it. 
Whatever 
these 
characteristics 
may 
be, 
let 
us 
call 
them 
common 
material 
characteristics, 
and 
let 
us 
say 
that 
they 
belong 
to 
or 
compose 
a 
common 
materialnature. 


The 
common 
material 
nature 
has 
its 
own 
way 
of 
existing, 
and 
perhaps 
its 
own 
principles 
of 
physical 
action. 
We 
may 
suppose 
that 
we 
know 
much 
or 
that 
we 
know 
little 
about 
it. 
This 
one 
thing 
at 
least 
we 
know, 
that 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
becoming 
alternatively 
either 
mutton 
or 
dog’s 
flesh. 
It 
is 
not 
essential 
to 
it 
to 
be 
mutton, 
or 
mutton 
it 
would 
always 
be; 
nor 
dog’s 
flesh, 
or 
it 
would 
always 
be 
dog’s 
flesh. 
It 
is 
capable 
of 
becoming 
either, 
according 
as 
it 
is 
captured 
by 
one 
or 
other 
system 
of 
formal 
organization. 
So 
the 
voters 
who 
are 
to 
go 
to 
the 
polls 
are, 
by 
their 
common 
nature, 
Englishmen; 
they 
are 
essentially 
neither 
Socialist 
curs 
nor 
Conservative 
sheep, 
but 
intrinsically 
capableofbecomingeither,if 
theybecomecapturedbyeithersystemofparty 
organization. 


According 
to 
this 
way 
of 
thinking, 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
looseness 
about 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
common 
material 
nature 
to 
the 
higher 
forms 
of 
organization 
capable 
of 
capturing 
it. 
Considered 
in 
itself 
alone, 
it 
is 
perhaps 
to 
be 
seen 
as 
governed 
by 
absolutely 
determined 
laws 
of 
its 
own. 
It 
is 
heavy, 
then 
it 
will 
fall 
unless 
obstructed; 
it 
is 
solid, 
then 
it 
will 
resist 
intrusions. 
But 
considered 
as 
material 
for 
organization 
by 
higher 
forms, 
it 
is 
indeterminate. 
It 
acts 
in 
one 
sort 
of 
way 
under 
the 
persuasion 
of 
the 
sheep-form, 
and 
in 
another 
sort 
of 
way 
under 
the 
persuasion 
of 
the 
dog-form, 
and 
we 
cannot 
tell 
how 
it 
will 
act 
until 
we 
know 
which 
form 
is 
going 
to 
capture 
it. 
No 
amount 
of 
study 
bestowed 
on 
the 
common 
material 
nature 
will 
enable 
us 
to 
judge 
how 
it 
will 
behave 
under 
the 
persuasion 
of 
the 
higher 
organizing 
form. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
discover 
thatis 
toexamine 
thehigherformitself. 



Every 
form, 
then, 
will 
really 
be 
the 
object 
of 
a 
distinct 
science. 
The 
form 
of 
the 
sheep 
and 
the 
form 
of 
the 
dog 
have 
much 
in 
common, 
but 
that 
merely 
happens 
to 
be 
so; 
we 
cannot 
depend 
upon 
it, 
or 
risk 
inferences 
from 
sheep 
to 
dog: 
we 
must 
examine 
each 
in 
itself; 
we 
shall 
really 
need 
a 
science 
of 
probatology 
about 
sheep, 
and 
cynology 
about 
dogs. 
Again, 
the 
common 
material 
nature 
has 
its 
own 
principles 
of 
being 
and 
action, 
so 
it 
will 
need 
a 
science 
of 
itself, 
which 
we 
may 
call 
hylology. 
Each 
of 
these 
sciences 
is 
mistress 
in 
her 
own 
province; 
but 
how 
many 
there 
are, 
and 
how 
puzzlingly 
they 
overlap! 
So 
long 
as 
we 
remain 
within 
the 
province 
of 
a 
single 
science, 
we 
may 
be 
able 
to 
think 
rigorously, 
everything 
will 
be 
‘tight’. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
consider 
border-issues 
between 
one 
province 
and 
another, 
farewell 
to 
exactitude: 
everything 
will 
be 
‘loose’. 
We 
can 
think 
out 
hylology 
till 
we 
are 
blue 
in 
the 
face, 
but 
we 
shall 
never 
discover 
anything 
about 
the 
entry 
of 
material 
elements 
into 
higher 
organizations, 
or 
how 
they 
behave 
when 
they 
getthere. 
We 
may 
form 
perfect 
definitionsanddescriptions 
of 
theform 
of 
the 
dog 
as 
such, 
and 
still 
derive 
no 
rules 
for 
telling 
what 
elements 
of 
matter 
will 
enter 
into 
the 
body 
of 
a 
given 
dog 
or 
how 
they 
will 
be 
placed 
when 
they 
do. 
All 
we 
can 
be 
sure 
of 
is, 
that 
the 
dog-form 
will 
keep 
itself 
going 
in, 
and 
by 
means 
of, 
the 
material 
it 
embodies 
— 
unless 
the 
dog 
dies. 
But 
what 
happens 
to 
the 
matter 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
dog 
is 
‘accidental’ 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
matter; 
and 
the 
use 
of 
this 
matter, 
rather 
than 
of 
some 
other 
equally 
suitable, 
is 
accidental 
tothenatureof 
the 
dog. 


No 
account 
of 
material 
events 
can 
dispense 
with 
accidental 
relations 
altogether. 
We 
must 
at 
least 
recognize 
that 
there 
are 
accidental 
relations 
between 
particular 
things. 
Accident 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
brute 
fact 
had 
to 
be 
acknowledged 
even 
by 
the 
tidiest 
and 
most 
dogmatic 
atomism 
of 
the 
last 
century. 
That 
atomism 
must 
allow 
it 
to 
be 
accidental, 
in 
this 
sense, 
that 
the 
space 
surrounding 
any 
given 
atom 
was 
occupied 
by 
other 
atoms 
in 
a 
given 



manner. 
It 
belonged 
neither 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
space 
to 
be 
occupied 
by 
just 
those 
atoms 
in 
just 
those 
places, 
nor 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
atoms 
to 
be 
distributed 
just 
like 
that 
over 
space; 
and 
so 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
the 
environment 
of 
any 
atom 
was 
an 
accidental 
environment. 
That 
is, 
the 
particular 
arrangement 
of 
the 
environment 
was 
accidental. 
The 
nature 
of 
the 
environment 
was 
not 
accidental 
at 
all. 
It 
was 
proper 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
atom 
to 
be 
in 
interaction 
with 
other 
atoms 
over 
a 
spatial 
field, 
and 
it 
never 
encountered 
in 
the 
fellow-denizens 
of 
space 
any 
other 
nature 
but 
its 
own. 
It 
was 
not 
subject 
to 
the 
accident 
of 
meeting 
strange 
natures, 
nor 
of 
becoming 
suddenly 
subject 
to 
strange 
or 
unequal 
laws 
of 
interaction. 
All 
interactions, 
being 
with 
its 
own 
kind, 
were 
reciprocal 
and 
obedient 
to 
a 
single 
set 
of 
calculable 
laws. 


But 
the 
medieval 
philosophy 
had 
asserted 
accidental 
relations 
between 
distinct 
sorts 
of 
natures, 
the 
form 
of 
living 
dog 
and 
the 
form 
of 
dead 
matter, 
for 
example. 
No 
one 
could 
know 
a 
priori 
what 
effect 
an 
accidental 
relation 
would 
produce, 
and 
all 
accidental 
relations 
between 
different 
pairs 
of 
natures 
were 
different: 
at 
the 
most 
there 
was 
analogy 
between 
them. 
Every 
different 
nature 
had 
to 
be 
separately 
observed, 
and 
when 
you 
had 
observed 
them 
all, 
you 
could 
still 
simply 
write 
an 
inventory 
of 
them, 
you 
could 
not 
hope 
to 
rationalize 
your 
body 
of 
knowledge. 
Let 
us 
narrow 
the 
field 
and 
consider 
what 
this 
doctrine 
allows 
us 
to 
know 
about 
the 
wood 
of 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
tree. 
We 
shall 
begin 
by 
observing 
the 
impressions 
it 
makes 
on 
our 
several 
senses, 
and 
we 
shall 
attribute 
to 
it 
a 
substantial 
form 
such 
as 
naturally 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
these 
impressions, 
without, 
perhaps, 
being 
so 
rash 
as 
to 
claim 
a 
knowledge 
of 
what 
this 
substantial 
form 
is. 
Still 
we 
do 
not 
know 
what 
its 
capacities 
of 
physical 
action 
and 
passion 
may 
be. 
We 
shall 
find 
them 
out 
by 
observing 
it 
in 
relation 
to 
different 
‘natures’. 
It 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
combustible 
by 
fire, 
resistant 
to 
water, 
tractable 
to 
the 
carpenter’s 
tools, 
intractable 
to 
his 
digestive 
organs, 



harmless 
to 
ostriches, 
nourishing 
to 
wood-beetles. 
Each 
of 
these 
capacities 
of 
the 
wood 
is 
distinct; 
we 
cannot 
relate 
them 
intelligibly 
to 
one 
another, 
nor 
deducethemfromtheassumedfundamental 
‘woodiness’. 


We 
can 
now 
see 
why 
‘substantial 
forms’ 
were 
the 
bêtes 
noires 
of 
the 
seventeenth-century 
philosophers. 
It 
was 
because 
they 
turned 
nature 
into 
an 
unmanageable 
jungle, 
in 
which 
trees, 
bushes, 
and 
parasites 
of 
a 
thousand 
kinds 
wildly 
interlaced. 
There 
was 
nothing 
for 
it, 
if 
science 
was 
to 
proceed, 
but 
to 
clear 
the 
ground 
and 
replant 
with 
spruce 
in 
rows: 
to 
postulate 
a 
single 
uniform 
nature, 
of 
which 
there 
should 
be 
a 
single 
science. 
Now 
neither 
probatology 
nor 
cynology 
could 
hope 
to 
be 
universal 
— 
the 
world 
is 
not 
all 
sheep 
nor 
all 
dog: 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be 
hylology; 
for 
the 
world 
is, 
in 
its 
spatial 
aspect, 
all 
material. 
Let 
us 
say, 
then, 
that 
there 
is 
one 
uniform 
material 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
that 
everything 
else 
consists 
in 
the 
arrangements 
of 
the 
basic 
material 
nature; 
as 
the 
show 
of 
towers 
and 
mountains 
in 
the 
sunset 
results 
simply 
from 
an 
arrangement 
of 
vapours. 
And 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
the 
interactions 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
matter 
are 
all 
like 
those 
which 
we 
can 
observe 
in 
dead 
manipulable 
bodies 
— 
in 
mechanism, 
in 
fact. 
Such 
was 
the 
postulate 
of 
thenewphilosophers, 
andityieldedthemresults. 


It 
yielded 
them 
results, 
and 
that 
was 
highly 
gratifying. 
But 
what, 
meanwhile, 
hadhappened 
tothosepalpablefacts 
ofcommonexperiencefrom 
which 
the 
whole 
philosophy 
of 
substantial 
forms 
had 
taken 
its 
rise? 
Is 
the 
wholeness 
of 
a 
living 
thing 
the 
mere 
resultant 
of 
the 
orderly 
operations 
of 
its 
parts? 
Is 
a 
bee 
no 
more 
essentially 
one 
than 
a 
swarm 
is? 
Is 
the 
life 
of 
a 
living 
animal 
indistinguishable 
from 
the 
rhythm 
of 
a 
going 
watch, 
except 
in 
degree 
ofcomplicationand 
subtletyofcontrivance?Andifan 
animal’sbody,saymy 
own, 
is 
simply 
an 
agglomerate 
of 
minute 
interacting 
material 
units, 
and 
its 
wholenessismerely 
accidentalandapparent, 
howis 
myconscious 
mind 
tobe 
adjusted 
to 
it? 
For 
my 
consciousness 
appears 
to 
identify 
itself 
with 
that 
whole 



vital 
pattern 
which 
used 
to 
be 
called 
the 
substantial 
form. 
We 
are 
now 
told 
that 
the 
pattern 
is 
nothing 
real 
or 
active, 
but 
the 
mere 
accidental 
resultant 
of 
distinct 
interacting 
forces: 
it 
does 
no 
work, 
it 
exercises 
no 
influence 
or 
control, 
it 
is 
nothing. 
How 
then 
can 
it 
be 
the 
vehicle 
and 
instrument 
of 
my 
conscious 
soul? 
It 
cannot. 
Then 
is 
my 
soul 
homeless? 
Or 
is 
it 
to 
be 
identified 
with 
the 
activity 
and 
fortunes 
of 
a 
single 
atomic 
constituent 
of 
my 
body, 
a 
single 
cog 
in 
the 
animal 
clockwork? 
If 
so, 
how 
irrational! 
For 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
experience 
itself 
as 
the 
soul 
of 
one 
minute 
part, 
but 
as 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
body. 


Such 
questions 
rose 
thick 
and 
fast 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
the 
seventeenth-century 
philosophers. 
It 
will 
cause 
us 
no 
great 
surprise 
that 
Leibniz 
should 
have 
quickly 
felt 
that 
the 
Formal 
Principle 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
of 
the 
Scholastic 
philosophy 
must 
be 
by 
hook 
or 
by 
crook 
reintroduced 
— 
not 
as 
the 
detested 
substantial 
form, 
but 
under 
a 
name 
by 
which 
it 
might 
hope 
to 
smell 
more 
sweet, 
entelechy. 


Nothing 
so 
tellingly 
revealed 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
new 
philosophy 
in 
dealing 
with 
living 
bodies 
as 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
solutions 
Descartes 
had 
proposed. 
He 
had 
boldly 
declared 
the 
unity 
of 
animal 
life 
to 
be 
purely 
mechanical, 
and 
denied 
that 
brutes 
had 
souls 
at 
all, 
or 
any 
sensation. 
He 
had 
to 
admit 
soul 
in 
man, 
but 
he 
still 
denied 
the 
substantial 
unity 
of 
the 
human 
body. 
It 
was 
put 
together 
like 
a 
watch, 
it 
was 
many 
things, 
not 
one: 
if 
Descartes 
had 
lived 
in 
our 
time, 
he 
would 
have 
been 
delighted 
to 
compare 
it 
with 
a 
telephone 
system, 
the 
nerves 
taking 
the 
place 
of 
the 
wires, 
and 
being 
so 
arranged 
that 
all 
currents 
of 
‘animal 
spirit’ 
flowing 
in 
them 
converged 
upon 
a 
single 
unit, 
a 
gland 
at 
the 
base 
of 
the 
brain. 
In 
this 
unit, 
or 
in 
the 
convergence 
of 
all 
the 
motions 
upon 
it, 
the 
‘unity’ 
of 
the 
body 
virtually 
consisted; 
and 
the 
soul 
was 
incarnate, 
not 
in 
the 
plurality 
of 
members 
(for 
howcouldit,beingone,indwellmanythings?),butinthesinglegland. 



Even 
so, 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
gland 
was 
absolutely 
unintelligible, 
as 
Descartes 
disarmingly 
confessed. 
Incarnation 
was 
all 
very 
well 
in 
the 
old 
philosophy: 
those 
who 
had 
allowed 
the 
interaction 
of 
disparate 
natures 
throughout 
the 
physical 
world 
need 
find 
no 
particular 
difficulty 
about 
the 
special 
case 
of 
it 
provided 
by 
incarnation. 
Why 
should 
not 
a 
form 
of 
conscious 
life 
so 
interact 
with 
what 
would 
otherwise 
be 
dead 
matter 
as 
to 
‘indwell’ 
it? 
But 
the 
very 
principle 
of 
the 
new 
philosophy 
disallowed 
the 
interaction 
of 
disparate 
natures, 
because 
such 
an 
interaction 
did 
not 
allow 
of 
exactformulation,itwasa 
‘loose’ 
andnota 
‘tight’ 
relation. 


From 
a 
purely 
practical 
point 
of 
view 
the 
much 
derided 
pineal 
gland 
theory 
would 
serve. 
If 
we 
could 
be 
content 
to 
view 
Descartes 
as 
a 
man 
who 
wanted 
to 
make 
the 
world 
safe 
for 
physical 
science, 
then 
there 
would 
be 
a 
good 
deal 
to 
be 
said 
for 
his 
doctrine. 
In 
the 
old 
philosophy 
exact 
science 
had 
been 
frustrated 
by 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
loose 
relations 
all 
over 
the 
field 
of 
nature. 
Descartes 
had 
cleared 
them 
from 
as 
much 
of 
the 
field 
as 
science 
was 
then 
in 
a 
position 
to 
investigate; 
he 
allowed 
only 
one 
such 
relation 
to 
subsist, 
the 
one 
which 
experience 
appeared 
unmistakably 
to 
force 
upon 
us 
— 
that 
between 
our 
own 
mind 
and 
its 
bodily 
vehicle. 
He 
had 
exorcized 
the 
spirits 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
nature; 
and 
though 
there 
was 
a 
spirit 
here 
which 
could 
not 
be 
exorcized, 
the 
philosophic 
conjurer 
had 
nevertheless 
confined 
it 
and 
its 
unaccountable 
pranks 
within 
a 
minutely 
narrow 
magic 
circle: 
all 
mind 
could 
do 
was 
to 
turn 
the 
one 
tiny 
switch 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
its 
animal 
telephone 
system. 
It 
could 
create 
no 
energy 
— 
it 
could 
merely 
redirect 
the 
currents 
actually 
flowing. 


Practically 
this 
might 
do, 
but 
speculatively 
it 
was 
most 
disturbing. 
For 
if 
the 
‘loose 
relation’ 
had 
to 
be 
admitted 
in 
one 
instance, 
it 
was 
admitted 
in 
principle; 
and 
one 
could 
not 
get 
rid 
of 
the 
suspicion 
that 
it 
would 
turn 
up 
elsewhere, 
and 
that 
the 
banishment 
of 
it 
from 
every 
other 
field 
represented 
a 



convenient 
pragmatic 
postulate 
rather 
than 
a 
solid 
metaphysical 
truth. 
Moreover, 
the 
correlation 
of 
the 
unitary 
soul 
with 
the 
unitary 
gland 
might 
do 
justice 
to 
a 
mechanistical 
philosophy, 
but 
it 
did 
not 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
soul’s 
own 
consciousness 
of 
itself. 
The 
soul’s 
consciousness 
is 
the 
‘idea’ 
or 
‘representation’ 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
whole 
body, 
certainly 
not 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
pineal 
gland 
nor, 
as 
the 
unreflective 
nowadays 
would 
say, 
of 
the 
brain. 
I 
am 
not 
conscious 
in, 
or 
of, 
my 
brain 
except 
when 
I 
have 
a 
headache; 
consciousness 
is 
in 
my 
eyes 
and 
finger-tips 
and 
so 
on. 
It 
is 
physically 
true, 
no 
doubt, 
that 
consciousness 
in 
and 
of 
my 
finger-tips 
is 
not 
possible 
without 
the 
functioning 
of 
my 
brain; 
but 
that 
is 
a 
poor 
reason 
for 
locating 
the 
consciousness 
in 
the 
brain. 
The 
filament 
of 
the 
electric 
bulb 
will 
not 
be 
incandescent 
apart 
from 
the 
functioning 
of 
the 
dynamo; 
but 
that 
is 
a 
poor 
reasonforsayingthattheincandescenceis 
inthedynamo. 


Certainly 
the 
area 
of 
representation 
in 
our 
mind 
is 
not 
simply 
equivalent 
to 
the 
area 
of 
our 
body. 
But 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
confines 
of 
mental 
representation 
part 
company 
with 
the 
confines 
of 
the 
body, 
it 
is 
not 
that 
they 
may 
contract 
and 
fall 
back 
upon 
the 
pineal 
gland, 
but 
that 
they 
may 
expand 
and 
advance 
over 
the 
surrounding 
world. 
The 
mind 
does 
not 
represent 
its 
own 
body 
merely, 
it 
represents 
the 
world 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
world 
affects 
that 
body 
or 
is 
physically 
reproduced 
in 
it. 
The 
mind 
has 
no 
observable 
natural 
relation 
to 
the 
pineal 
gland. 
It 
has 
only 
two 
natural 
relations: 
to 
its 
body 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
to 
its 
effective 
environment. 
What 
Descartes 
had 
really 
done 
was 
to 
pretend 
that 
the 
soul 
was 
related 
to 
the 
pineal 
gland 
as 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
related 
to 
its 
whole 
body; 
and 
then 
that 
it 
was 
related 
to 
the 
bodily 
members 
as 
in 
fact 
it 
is 
related 
to 
outer 
environment. 
The 
members 
became 
an 
inner 
environment, 
known 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
affected 
the 
pineal 
gland; 
just 
as 
the 
outer 
environment 
inits 
turnwas 
tobeknownonlyin 
sofarasitaffectedthemembers. 



This 
doctrine 
of 
a 
double 
environment 
was 
wholly 
artificial. 
It 
was 
forced 
on 
Descartes 
by 
the 
requirements 
of 
mechanistical 
science: 
if 
the 
members 
were 
simply 
a 
plurality 
of 
things, 
they 
must 
really 
be 
parts 
of 
environment; 
the 
body 
which 
the 
soul 
indwelt 
must 
be 
a 
body; 
presumably, 
then, 
the 
pineal 
gland. 
An 
untenable 
compromise, 
surely, 
between 
admitting 
and 
denying 
the 
realityof 
the 
soul’sincarnation. 


What, 
then, 
was 
to 
be 
done? 
Descartes’s 
rivals 
and 
successors 
attempted 
several 
solutions, 
which 
it 
would 
be 
too 
long 
to 
examine 
here. 
They 
dissatisfied 
Leibniz 
and 
they 
have 
certainly 
no 
less 
dissatisfied 
posterity. 
It 
will 
be 
enough 
for 
us 
here 
to 
consider 
what 
Leibniz 
did. 
He 
admitted, 
to 
begin 
with, 
the 
psychological 
fact. 
The 
unity 
of 
consciousness 
is 
the 
representation 
of 
a 
plurality 
— 
the 
plurality 
of 
the 
members, 
and 
through 
them 
the 
plurality 
of 
the 
world. 
Here, 
surely, 
was 
the 
very 
principle 
the 
new 
philosophy 
needed 
for 
the 
reconciliation 
of 
substantial 
unity 
with 
mechanical 
plurality 
of 
parts. 
For 
it 
is 
directly 
evident 
to 
us 
that 
consciousness 
focuses 
the 
plurality 
of 
environing 
things 
in 
a 
unity 
of 
representation. 
This 
is 
no 
philosophical 
theory, 
it 
is 
a 
simple 
fact. 
Our 
body, 
then, 
as 
a 
physical 
system 
is 
amechanicalplurality; 
asfocusedinconsciousness 
itis 
aunity 
of 
‘idea’. 


Very 
well: 
but 
we 
have 
not 
got 
far 
yet. 
For 
the 
old 
difficulty 
still 
remains 


— 
it 
is 
purely 
arbitrary, 
after 
all, 
that 
a 
unitary 
consciousness 
should 
be 
attached 
to, 
and 
represent, 
a 
mechanical 
collection 
of 
things 
which 
happen 
to 
interact 
in 
a 
sort 
of 
pattern. 
If 
there 
is 
a 
consciousness 
attached 
to 
human 
bodies, 
then 
why 
not 
to 
systems 
of 
clockwork? 
If 
the 
body 
is 
represented 
as 
unity, 
it 
must 
surely 
be 
because 
it 
is 
unity, 
as 
the 
old 
philosophy 
had 
held. 
But 
how 
can 
we 
reintroduce 
unity 
into 
the 
body 
without 
reintroducing 
substantial 
form, 
and 
destroying 
the 
mechanistical 
plurality 
which 
the 
new 
sciencedemanded? 

It 
is 
at 
this 
point 
that 
Leibniz 
produces 
the 
speculative 
postulate 
of 
his 
system. 
Why 
not 
reverse 
the 
relation, 
and 
make 
the 
members 
represent 
the 
mind 
as 
the 
mind 
represents 
the 
members? 
For 
then 
the 
unity 
of 
person 
representedin 
themind 
willbecomesomething 
actualin 
themembers 
also. 


Representation 
appears 
to 
common 
sense 
to 
be 
a 
one-way 
sort 
of 
traffic. 
If 
my 
mind 
represents 
my 
bodily 
members, 
something 
happens 
to 
my 
mind, 
for 
it 
becomes 
a 
representation 
of 
such 
members 
in 
such 
a 
state; 
but 
nothing 
happens 
to 
the 
members 
by 
their 
being 
so 
represented 
in 
the 
mind. 
The 
mental 
representation 
obeys 
the 
bodily 
facts; 
the 
bodily 
facts 
do 
not 
obey 
the 
mental 
representation. 
It 
seems 
nonsense 
to 
say 
that 
my 
members 
obey 
my 
mind 
because 
they 
are 
mirrored 
in 
it. 
And 
yet 
my 
members 
do 
obey 
my 
mind, 
or 
at 
least 
common 
sense 
supposes 
so. 
Sometimes 
my 
mind, 
instead 
of 
representing 
the 
state 
my 
members 
are 
in, 
represents 
a 
state 
which 
it 
intends 
that 
they 
shall 
be 
in, 
for 
example, 
that 
my 
hand 
should 
go 
through 
the 
motion 
of 
writing 
these 
words. 
And 
my 
hand 
obeys; 
its 
action 
becomes 
the 
moving 
diagram 
of 
my 
thought, 
my 
thought 
is 
represented 
or 
expressed 
in 
the 
manual 
act. 
Here 
the 
relation 
of 
mind 
and 
members 
appears 
to 
be 
reversed: 
instead 
of 
its 
representing 
them, 
they 
represent 
it. 
With 
this 
representation 
it 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
it 
was 
with 
the 
other. 
By 
the 
members’ 
being 
represented 
in 
the 
mind, 
something 
happened 
to 
the 
mind, 
and 
nothing 
to 
the 
members; 
by 
the 
mind’s 
being 
represented 
in 
the 
members 
something 
happens 
to 
the 
membersandnothingtothemind. 


Why 
should 
not 
we 
take 
this 
seriously? 
Why 
not 
allow 
that 
there 
is 
two-
way 
traffic 
— 
by 
one 
relation 
the 
mind 
represents 
the 
members, 
by 
another 
the 
members 
represent 
the 
mind? 
But 
then 
again, 
how 
can 
we 
take 
it 
seriously? 
For 
representation, 
in 
the 
required 
sense, 
is 
a 
mental 
act; 
brute 
matter 
can 
represent 
nothing, 
only 
mind 
can 
represent. 
And 
the 
members 
are 
brute 
matter. 
But 
are 
they? 
How 
do 
we 
know 
that? 
By 
brute 
matter 
we 



understand 
extended 
lumps 
of 
stuff, 
interacting 
with 
one 
another 
mechanically, 
as 
do, 
for 
example, 
two 
cogs 
in 
a 
piece 
of 
clockwork. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
large-scale 
view. 
The 
cogs 
are 
themselves 
composed 
of 
interrelated 
parts 
and 
those 
parts 
of 
others, 
and 
so 
on 
ad 
infinitum. 
Who 
knows 
what 
the 
ultimate 
constituents 
really 
are? 
The 
‘modern’ 
philosophers, 
certainly, 
have 
proposed 
no 
hypothesis 
about 
them 
which 
even 
looks 
like 
making 
sense. 
They 
have 
supposed 
that 
the 
apparently 
inert 
lumps, 
the 
cogs, 
are 
composed 
of 
parts 
themselves 
equally 
inert, 
and 
that 
by 
subdivision 
we 
shall 
still 
reach 
nothing 
but 
the 
inert. 
But 
this 
supposition 
is 
in 
flat 
contradiction 
with 
what 
physical 
theory 
demands. 
We 
have 
to 
allow 
the 
reality 
of 
force 
in 
physics. 
Now 
the 
force 
which 
large-scale 
bodies 
display 
may 
easily 
be 
the 
block-
effect 
of 
activity 
in 
their 
minute 
real 
constituents. 
If 
not, 
where 
does 
it 
come 
from? 
Let 
it 
be 
supposed, 
then, 
that 
these 
minute 
real 
constituents 
are 
active 
because 
they 
are 
alive, 
because 
they 
are 
minds; 
for 
indeed 
we 
have 
no 
notion 
of 
activity 
other 
than 
the 
perception 
we 
have 
of 
our 
own. 
We 
have 
no 
notion 
of 
it 
except 
as 
something 
mental. 
On 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
constituents 
of 
active 
body 
are 
also 
mental, 
this 
limitation 
in 
our 
conception 
of 
activity 
need 
causeusneithersorrow 
norsurprise. 


The 
mind-units 
which 
make 
up 
body 
will 
not 
of 
course 
be 
developed 
and 
fully 
conscious 
minds 
like 
yours 
or 
mine, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
for 
want 
of 
a 
better 
word 
that 
we 
call 
them 
minds 
at 
all. 
They 
will 
be 
mere 
unselfconscious 
representations 
of 
their 
physical 
environment, 
as 
it 
might 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
physical 
point 
to 
which 
they 
belong 
by 
a 
human 
mind 
paying 
no 
attention 
at 
all 
to 
its 
own 
seeing. 
How 
many 
of 
these 
rudimentary 
‘minds’ 
will 
there 
be 
in 
mybody?As 
many 
as 
you 
like 
—asmanyas 
itis 
possiblethere 
shouldbe 
— 
sayaninfinitenumberandhavedonewithit. 


We 
may 
now 
observe 
how 
this 
hypothesis 
introduces 
real 
formal 
unity 
without 
prejudicing 
mechanical 
plurality. 
Each 
of 
the 
mind-units 
in 
my 
body 



is 
itself 
and 
substantially 
distinct. 
But 
since 
each, 
in 
its 
own 
way 
and 
according 
to 
its 
own 
position, 
represents 
the 
superior 
and 
more 
developed 
mind 
which 
I 
call 
‘me’, 
they 
will 
order 
themselves 
according 
to 
a 
common 
form. 
The 
order 
is 
real, 
not 
accidental: 
it 
is 
like 
the 
order 
of 
troops 
on 
a 
parade-ground. 
Each 
man 
is 
a 
distinct 
active 
unit, 
but 
each 
is 
really 
expressing 
by 
his 
action 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
officer 
in 
command. 
He 
is 
expressing 
no 
less 
his 
relation 
to 
the 
other 
men 
in 
the 
ranks 
— 
to 
obey 
the 
officer 
is 
to 
keep 
in 
step 
with 
them. 
So 
the 
metaphysical 
units 
of 
the 
body, 
being 
all 
minds, 
represent 
one 
another 
as 
well 
as 
the 
dominant 
mind: 
one 
anotherco-ordinately, 
thedominantmindsubordinately. 


But 
if 
the 
metaphysically 
real 
units 
of 
the 
body 
are 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
mind, 
then 
the 
mind 
is 
a 
mind 
among 
minds, 
a 
spirit-atom 
among 
spirit-atoms. 
What 
then 
constitutes 
its 
superiority 
or 
dominance, 
and 
makes 
it 
a 
mind 
par 
excellence? 
Well, 
what 
constitutes 
the 
officer 
an 
officer? 
Two 
things: 
a 
more 
developed 
mentality 
and 
the 
fact 
of 
being 
obeyed. 
In 
military 
life 
these 
two 
factors 
are 
not 
always 
perfectly 
proportioned 
to 
one 
another, 
but 
in 
the 
order 
of 
Leibniz’ 
universe 
they 
are. 
A 
fuller 
power 
to 
represent 
the 
universe 
is 
necessarily 
combined 
with 
dominance 
over 
an 
organized 
troop 
of 
members; 
for 
the 
mind 
knows 
the 
universe 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
universe 
is 
expressed 
in 
its 
body. 
That 
is 
what 
the 
finitude 
of 
the 
mind 
means. 
Only 
an 
infinite 
mind 
appreciates 
the 
whole 
plurality 
of 
things 
in 
themselves; 
a 
finite 
mind 
perceives 
them 
in 
so 
far 
as 
mirrored 
in 
the 
physical 
being 
of 
an 
organized 
body 
of 
members. 
The 
more 
adequate 
the 
mirror, 
the 
more 
adequate 
the 
representation: 
the 
more 
highly 
organized 
the 
body, 
the 
more 
developed 
the 
mind. 


The 
developed 
mind 
has 
an 
elaborate 
body; 
but 
the 
least 
developed 
mind 
has 
still 
some 
body, 
or 
it 
would 
lack 
any 
mirror 
whatever 
through 
which 
to 
represent 
the 
world. 
This 
means, 
in 
effect, 
that 
Leibniz’ 
system 
is 
not 
an 



unmitigated 
spiritual 
atomism. 
For 
though 
the 
spiritual 
atoms, 
or 
monads, 
are 
the 
ultimate 
constituents 
out 
of 
which 
nature 
is 
composed, 
they 
stand 
composed 
together 
from 
the 
beginning 
in 
a 
minimal 
order 
which 
cannot 
be 
broken 
up. 
Each 
monad, 
if 
it 
is 
to 
be 
anything 
at 
all, 
must 
be 
a 
continuing 
finiterepresentation 
ofthe 
universe, 
and 
to 
be 
thatitmusthave 
a 
body, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
it 
must 
have 
other 
monads 
in 
a 
permanent 
relation 
of 
mutual 
correspondence 
with 
it. 
And 
if 
you 
said 
to 
Leibniz, 
‘But 
surely 
any 
physical 
body 
can 
be 
broken 
up, 
and 
this 
must 
mean 
the 
dissolution 
of 
the 
organic 
relation 
between 
its 
monadical 
constituents,’ 
he 
would 
take 
refuge 
in 
the 
infinitesimal. 
The 
wonders 
revealed 
by 
that 
new 
miracle, 
the 
microscope, 
suggested 
what 
the 
intrinsic 
divisibility 
of 
space 
itself 
suggests 
— 
whatever 
organization 
is 
broken 
up, 
there 
will 
still 
be 
a 
minute 
organization 
within 
each 
of 
the 
fragments 
which 
remains 
unbroken 
— 
and 
so 
ad 
infinitum. 
You 
will 
never 
come 
down 
to 
loose 
monads, 
monads 
out 
of 
all 
organization. 
You 
will 
never 
disembody 
the 
monads, 
and 
so 
remove 
their 
representative 
power; 
you 
will 
only 
reduce 
their 
bodies 
and 
so 
impoverish 
their 
representative 
power. 
In 
this 
sense 
no 
animal 
dies 
and 
no 
animal 
is 
generated. 
Death 
is 
the 
reductionandgenerationtheenrichment 
ofsomeexistingmonad’sbody;and, 
bybeingthat,istheenrichment 
orthereductionofthemonad’smentallife. 


‘But,’ 
our 
common 
sense 
protests, 
‘it 
is 
too 
great 
a 
strain 
on 
our 
credulity 
to 
make 
the 
real 
nature 
of 
things 
so 
utterly 
different 
from 
what 
sense 
and 
science 
make 
of 
them. 
If 
the 
real 
universe 
is 
what 
you 
say 
it 
is, 
why 
do 
our 
minds 
represent 
it 
to 
us 
as 
they 
do?’ 
The 
philosopher’s 
answer 
is, 
‘Because 
they 
represent 
it. 
According 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
things, 
each 
monad 
is 
simply 
its 
own 
mental 
life, 
its 
own 
world-view, 
its 
own 
thoughts 
and 
desires. 
To 
know 
things 
as 
they 
are 
would 
be 
simultaneously 
to 
live 
over, 
as 
though 
from 
within 
and 
by 
a 
miracle 
of 
sympathy, 
the 
biographies 
of 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
distinct 
monads. 
This 
is 
absolutely 
impossible. 
Our 
senses 
represent 
the 



coexistent 
families 
of 
monads 
in 
the 
gross, 
and 
therefore 
conventionally; 
what 
is 
in 
fact 
the 
mutual 
representation 
of 
monads 
in 
ordered 
systems, 
is 
represented 
as 
the 
mechanical 
interaction 
of 
spatially 
extended 
and 
material 
parts.’ 
This 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
science 
is 
overthrown. 
The 
physical 
worldview 
is 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
convention 
of 
representation, 
but 
it 
is 
not, 
for 
all 
that, 
illusory. 
It 
can, 
ideally, 
be 
made 
as 
true 
as 
it 
is 
capable 
of 
being. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
whatever 
for 
confusing 
the 
‘well-grounded 
seemings’ 
of 
the 
apparent 
physical 
worldwith 
the 
fantasticseemingsof 
dreamandhallucination. 


So 
far 
the 
argument 
seems 
to 
draw 
whatever 
cogency 
it 
has 
from 
the 
simplicity 
and 
naturalness 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
representation. 
The 
nature 
of 
idea, 
it 
is 
assumed, 
is 
to 
represent 
plurality 
in 
a 
unified 
view. 
If 
idea 
did 
not 
represent, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
idea. 
And 
since 
there 
is 
idea 
(for 
our 
minds 
at 
least 
exist 
and 
are 
made 
up 
of 
idea) 
there 
is 
representation. 
It 
belongs 
to 
idea 
to 
represent, 
and 
since 
the 
whole 
world 
has 
now 
been 
interpreted 
as 
a 
system 
of 
mutually 
representing 
ideations, 
or 
ideators, 
it 
might 
seem 
that 
all 
their 
mutual 
relations 
are 
perfectly 
natural, 
a 
harmony 
of 
agreement 
which 
could 
not 
be 
other 
than 
it 
is. 
But 
if 
so, 
why 
does 
Leibniz 
keep 
saying 
that 
the 
harmony 
is 
pre-established, 
by 
special 
and 
infinitely 
elaborate 
divine 
decrees? 


Leibniz 
himself 
says 
that 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
representation 
excludes 
interaction. 
By 
representing 
environment 
a 
mind 
does 
not 
do 
anything 
to 
environment, 
that 
is 
plain. 
But 
it 
is 
no 
less 
plain 
that 
environment 
does 
nothing 
to 
it, 
either. 
The 
act 
of 
representing 
is 
simply 
the 
act 
of 
the 
mind; 
it 
represents 
in 
view 
of 
environment, 
of 
course, 
but 
not 
under 
the 
causal 
influence 
of 
environment. 
Representationis 
a 
business 
carried 
on 
bythe 
mind 
onitsownaccount,and 
invirtueofitsinnatepowertorepresent. 


Very 
well; 
but 
does 
this 
consideration 
really 
drive 
us 
into 
theology? 
Is 
not 
Leibniz 
the 
victim 
of 
a 
familiar 
fallacy, 
that 
of 
incompletely 
stated 



alternatives? 
‘Either 
finite 
beings 
interact 
or 
else 
they 
do 
not 
directly 
condition 
one 
another. 
Monads 
do 
not 
interact, 
therefore 
they 
do 
not 
directly 
condition 
one 
another. 
How 
then 
explain 
the 
actual 
conformity 
of 
their 
mutual 
representation, 
without 
recourse 
to 
divine 
fore-ordaining?’ 
It 
seems 
sufficient 
to 
introduce 
a 
further 
alternative 
in 
the 
first 
line 
of 
the 
argument, 
and 
we 
are 
rid 
of 
the 
theology. 
Things 
may 
condition 
the 
action 
of 
a 
further 
thing, 
without 
acting 
upon 
it. 
It 
acts 
of 
itself, 
but 
it 
acts 
in 
view 
of 
what 
they 
are. 
We 
are 
tempted 
to 
conclude 
that 
Leibniz 
has 
introduced 
the 
Deus 
ex 
machina 
withthefatalfacilityofhisage. 
‘Wherealittlefurthermeditation 
on 
the 
characters 
in 
the 
play 
would 
furnish 
a 
natural 
dénouement, 
he 
swings 
divine 
intervention 
on 
to 
the 
scene 
by 
wires 
from 
the 
ceiling. 
It 
is 
easy 
for 
us 
to 
reconstruct 
for 
him 
the 
end 
of 
the 
piece 
without 
recourse 
to 
stage-
machines.’ 


Is 
it? 
No, 
I 
fear 
it 
is 
not. 
There 
is 
really 
no 
avoiding 
the 
pre-established 
harmony. 
And 
so 
we 
shall 
discover, 
if 
we 
pursue 
our 
train 
of 
reflexion 
a 
little 
further. 
It 
is 
natural, 
we 
were 
saying, 
than 
an 
idea 
should 
represent 
an 
environment; 
indeed, 
it 
is 
the 
representation 
of 
one. 
Given 
no 
environment 
to 
represent, 
it 
would 
be 
empty, 
a 
mere 
capacity 
for 
representation. 
Then 
every 
idea 
or 
ideator, 
taken 
merely 
in 
itself, 
is 
an 
empty 
capacity. 
But 
of 
what 
is 
the 
environment 
of 
each 
made 
up? 
According 
to 
the 
Leibnitian 
theory, 
of 
further 
ideas 
or 
ideators: 
of 
empty 
capacities, 
therefore. 
Then 
no 
idea 
will 
either 
be 
anything 
in 
itself, 
or 
find 
anything 
in 
its 
neighbours 
to 
represent. 
An 
unhappy 
predicament, 
like 
that 
of 
a 
literary 
clique 
in 
which 
all 
the 
members 
are 
adepts 
at 
discussing 
one 
another’s 
ideas 
— 
only 
that 
unfortunately 
none 
of 
them 
are 
provided 
with 
any; 
or 
like 
the 
shaky 
economics 
of 
the 
fabled 
Irish 
village 
where 
theyalllivedbytakinginoneanother’swashing. 


It 
is 
useless, 
then, 
to 
conceive 
representations 
as 
simply 
coming 
into 
existence 
in 
response 
to 
environment, 
and 
modelling 
themselves 
on 



environment. 
They 
must 
all 
mutually 
reflect 
environment 
or 
they 
would 
not 
be 
representations; 
but 
they 
must 
also 
exist 
as 
themselves 
and 
in 
their 
own 
right 
or 
there 
would 
be 
no 
environment 
for 
them 
mutually 
to 
represent. 
Since 
the 
world 
is 
infinitely 
various, 
each 
representor 
must 
have 
its 
own 
distinct 
character 
or 
nature, 
as 
our 
minds 
have: 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
it 
must 
represent 
in 
its 
own 
individual 
way; 
and 
all 
these 
endlessly 
various 
representations 
must 
be 
so 
constituted 
as 
to 
form 
a 
mutually 
reflecting 
harmony. 
Considered 
as 
a 
representation, 
each 
monadical 
existence 
simply 
reflects 
the 
universe 
after 
its 
own 
manner. 
But 
considered 
as 
something 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
others, 
it 
is 
a 
self-existent 
mental 
life, 
or 
world 
of 
ideas. 
Now 
when 
we 
are 
considering 
the 
fact 
of 
representation, 
that 
which 
is 
to 
be 
represented 
comes 
first 
and 
the 
representation 
follows 
upon 
it. 
Thus 
in 
considering 
the 
Leibnitian 
universe, 
we 
must 
begin 
with 
the 
monads 
as 
self-existent 
mental 
lives, 
or 
worlds 
of 
ideas; 
their 
representation 
of 
one 
another 
comes 
second. 
Nothing 
surely, 
then, 
but 
omnipotent 
creative 
wisdom 
could 
have 
pre-established 
between 
so 
many 
distinct 
given 
mental 
worlds 
that 
harmony 
which 
constitutes 
their 
mutual 
representation. 


Our 
common-sense 
pluralistic 
thinking 
escapes 
from 
the 
need 
of 
the 
preestablished 
harmony 
by 
distinguishing 
what 
we 
are 
from 
what 
we 
do. 
Let 
the 
world 
be 
made 
up 
of 
a 
plurality 
of 
agents 
in 
a 
‘loose’ 
order, 
with 
room 
to 
manoeuvre 
and 
to 
adjust 
themselves 
to 
one 
another. 
Then, 
by 
good 
luck 
or 
good 
management, 
through 
friction 
and 
disaster, 
by 
trial 
and 
error, 
by 
accident 
or 
invention, 
they 
may 
work 
out 
for 
themselves 
aharmonyof 
action. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
for 
divine 
preordaining 
here. 
But 
on 
Leibniz’ 
view 
what 
the 
monads 
do 
is 
to 
represent, 
and 
what 
they 
are 
is 
representation; 
there 
is 
no 
ultimate 
distinction 
between 
what 
they 
are 
and 
what 
they 
do: 
all 
that 
they 
do 
belongs 
to 
what 
they 
are. 
The 
whole 
system 
of 
action 
in 
each 
monad, 
which 
fits 
with 
such 
infinite 
complexity 
the 
system 
of 
action 
in 
each 
other 
monad, 
is 



precisely 
the 
existence 
of 
that 
monad, 
and 
apart 
from 
it 
the 
monad 
is 
not. 
The 
monads 
do 
not 
achieve 
a 
harmony, 
they 
are 
a 
harmony, 
and 
therefore 
they 
arepre-establishedinharmony. 


Leibniz 
denied 
that 
he 
invoked 
God 
to 
intervene 
in 
nature, 
or 
that 
there 
was 
anything 
arbitrary 
or 
artificial 
about 
his 
physical 
theology. 
He 
was 
simply 
analysing 
nature 
and 
finding 
it 
to 
be 
a 
system 
of 
mutual 
representation; 
he 
was 
analysing 
mutual 
representation 
and 
finding 
it 
to 
be 
of 
its 
nature 
intrinsically 
pre-established, 
and 
therefore 
God-dependent. 
He 
was 
not 
adding 
anything 
to 
mutual 
representation, 
he 
was 
just 
showing 
what 
it 
necessarily 
contained 
or 
implied. 
At 
least 
he 
was 
doing 
nothing 
worse 
than 
recognized 
scholastic 
practice. 
Scholastic 
Aristotelianism 
explained 
all 
natural 
causality 
as 
response 
to 
stimulus, 
and 
then 
had 
to 
postulate 
a 
stimulus 
which 
stimulatedwithout 
beingstimulated, 
and 
thiswas 
God. 
Apart 
from 
this 
supreme 
and 
first 
stimulus 
nothing 
would 
in 
fact 
be 
moving. 
The 
Aristotelians 
claimed 
simply 
to 
be 
analysing 
the 
nature 
of 
physical 
motion 
as 
they 
perceived 
it, 
and 
to 
find 
the 
necessity 
of 
perpetually 
applied 
divine 
stimulation 
implicit 
in 
it. 
No 
violence 
was 
thereby 
done 
to 
the 
system 
of 
physical 
motion 
nor 
was 
anything 
brought 
in 
from 
without 
to 
patch 
it 
up; 
it 
was 
simplyfoundtobeofitsown 
natureGod-dependent. 


It 
seems 
as 
though 
the 
reproachful 
description 
‘Deus 
ex 
machina’ 
should 
be 
reserved 
for 
more 
arbitrary 
expedients 
than 
Aristotle’s 
or 
Leibniz’, 
say 
for 
the 
occasionalist 
theory. 
Occasionalism 
appeared 
to 
introduce 
God 
that 
he 
might 
make 
physical 
matter 
do 
what 
it 
had 
no 
natural 
tendency 
to 
do, 
viz. 
to 
obey 
the 
volitions 
of 
finite 
mind. 
Ideas, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
have 
a 
natural 
tendency 
to 
represent 
one 
another, 
for 
to 
be 
an 
idea 
is 
to 
be 
a 
representation; 
God 
is 
not 
introduced 
by 
Leibniz 
to 
make 
them 
correspond, 
he 
is 
introduced 
to 
work 
a 
system 
in 
which 
they 
shall 
correspond. 
This 
may 
not 
be 
Deus-exmachina 
philosophy, 
but 
it 
is 
physical 
theology; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
it 
treats 
divine 



action 
as 
one 
factor 
among 
the 
factors 
which 
together 
constitute 
the 
working 
of 
the 
natural 
system. 
And 
this 
appears 
to 
be 
perhaps 
unscientific, 
certainly 
blasphemous: 
God’s 
action 
cannot 
be 
a 
factor 
among 
factors; 
the 
Creator 
works 
through 
and 
in 
all 
creaturely 
action 
equally; 
we 
can 
never 
say 
‘This 
is 
the 
creature, 
and 
that 
is 
God’ 
of 
distinguishable 
causalities 
in 
the 
natural 
world. 
The 
creature 
is, 
in 
its 
creaturely 
action, 
self-sufficient: 
but 
because 
a 
creature, 
insufficient 
to 
itself 
throughout, 
and 
sustained 
by 
its 
Creator 
both 
in 
existenceandinaction. 


The 
only 
acceptable 
argument 
for 
theism 
is 
that 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
religious 
consciousness, 
and 
builds 
upon 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
finite 
existence 
throughout, 
because 
it 
is 
finite. 
All 
arguments 
to 
God’s 
existence 
from 
a 
particular 
gap 
in 
our 
account 
of 
the 
world 
of 
finites 
are 
to 
be 
rejected. 
They 
do 
not 
indicate 
God, 
they 
indicate 
the 
failure 
of 
our 
power 
to 
analyse 
the 
world-order. 
When 
Leibniz 
discovered 
that 
his 
system 
of 
mutual 
representations 
needed 
to 
be 
pre-established, 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
seen 
that 
he 
had 
come 
up 
a 
cul-de-sac 
and 
backed 
out; 
he 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
said, 
‘With 
thehelpof 
GodIwillleapoverthewall.’ 


If 
we 
condemn 
Leibniz 
for 
writing 
physical 
theology, 
we 
condemn 
not 
him 
but 
his 
age. 
No 
contemporary 
practice 
was 
any 
better, 
and 
much 
of 
it 
a 
good 
deal 
worse, 
as 
Leibniz 
liked 
somewhat 
complacently 
to 
point 
out. 
And 
because 
he 
comes 
to 
theology 
through 
physical 
theology, 
that 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
all 
his 
theology 
was 
physical 
theology 
and 
as 
such 
to 
be 
written 
off. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
Leibniz 
is 
led 
to 
wrestle 
with 
many 
problems 
which 
beset 
any 
philosophical 
theism 
of 
the 
Christian 
type. 
This 
is 
particularly 
so 
in 
the 
Theodicy, 
as 
its 
many 
citations 
of 
theologians 
suggest. 
His 
discussions 
never 
lack 
ingenuity, 
and 
the 
system 
of 
creation 
and 
providence 
in 
which 
they 
result 
has 
much 
of 
that 
luminous 
serenity 
which 
colours 
the 
best 
works 
of 
the 
AgeofReason. 



Every 
theistic 
philosopher 
is 
bound, 
with 
whatever 
cautions, 
to 
conceive 
God 
by 
the 
analogy 
of 
the 
human 
mind. 
When 
Leibniz 
declares 
the 
harmony 
of 
monads 
to 
be 
pre-established 
by 
God, 
he 
is 
invoking 
the 
image 
of 
intelligent 
human 
pre-arrangement. 
Nor 
is 
he 
content 
simply 
to 
leave 
it 
at 
that: 
he 
endeavours 
as 
well 
as 
he 
may 
to 
conceive 
the 
sort 
of 
act 
by 
which 
God 
pre-arranges; 
and 
this 
involves 
the 
detailed 
adaptation 
for 
theological 
purposes 
ofLeibnitian 
doctrineaboutthehumanmind. 


The 
human 
mind, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
is 
the 
mind 
predominant 
in 
a 
certain 
system 
of 
‘minds’, 
viz. 
in 
those 
which 
constitute 
the 
members 
of 
the 
human 
body. 
If 
we 
call 
it 
predominant, 
we 
mean 
that 
its 
system 
of 
ideas 
is 
more 
developed 
than 
theirs, 
so 
that 
there 
are 
more 
points 
in 
which 
each 
of 
them 
conforms 
to 
it 
than 
in 
which 
it 
conforms 
to 
any 
one 
of 
them. 
The 
conception 
of 
a 
divine 
pre-establishing 
mind 
will 
be 
analogous. 
It 
will 
be 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
mind 
absolutely 
dominant, 
to 
whose 
ideas, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
whole 
system 
simply 
corresponds, 
without 
any 
reciprocating 
correspondence 
on 
his 
side. 
In 
a 
certain 
sense 
this 
is 
to 
make 
God 
the 
‘Mind 
of 
the 
World’; 
and 
yet 
the 
associations 
of 
the 
phrase 
are 
misleading. 
It 
suggests 
that 
the 
world 
is 
an 
organism 
or 
body 
in 
which 
the 
divine 
mind 
is 
incarnate, 
and 
on 
which 
he 
relies 
for 
his 
representations. 
But 
that 
is 
nonsense; 
the 
world 
is 
not 
a 
body, 
nor 
is 
it 
organic 
to 
God. 
Absolute 
dominance 
involves 
absolute 
transcendence: 
if 
everything 
in 
the 
world 
without 
remainder 
simply 
obeys 
the 
divine 
thoughts, 
that 
is 
only 
another 
way 
of 
saying 
that 
the 
world 
is 
the 
creature 
of 
God; 
the 
whole 
system 
is 
pre-established 
by 
him 
who 
is 
absolute 
Being 
andperfectly 
independent 
oftheworld. 


Of 
createdness, 
or 
pre-establishedness, 
there 
is 
no 
more 
to 
be 
said: 
we 
can 
think 
of 
it 
as 
nothing 
but 
the 
pure 
or 
absolute 
case 
of 
subjection 
to 
dominant 
mind. 
It 
is 
no 
use 
asking 
further 
how 
God’s 
thoughts 
are 
obeyed 
in 
the 
existence 
and 
action 
of 
things. 
What 
we 
can 
and 
must 
enquire 
into 
further, 
is 



the 
nature 
of 
the 
divine 
thoughts 
which 
are 
thus 
obeyed. 
They 
must 
be 
understood 
to 
be 
volitions 
or 
decrees. 
There 
are 
indeed 
two 
ways 
in 
which 
things 
obey 
the 
divine 
thought, 
and 
correspondingly 
two 
sorts 
of 
divine 
thoughts 
that 
they 
obey. 
In 
so 
far 
as 
created 
things 
conform 
to 
the 
mere 
universal 
principles 
of 
reason, 
they 
obey 
a 
reasonableness 
which 
is 
an 
inherent 
characteristic 
of 
the 
divine 
mind 
itself. 
If 
God 
wills 
the 
existence 
of 
any 
creature, 
that 
creature’s 
existence 
must 
observe 
the 
limits 
prescribed 
by 
eternal 
reason: 
it 
cannot, 
for 
example, 
both 
have 
and 
lack 
a 
certain 
characteristic 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time; 
nor 
can 
it 
contain 
two 
parts 
and 
two 
parts 
which 
are 
not 
also 
countable 
as 
one 
part 
and 
three 
parts. 
Finite 
things, 
if 
they 
exist 
at 
all, 
must 
thus 
conform 
to 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
divine 
nature, 
but 
what 
the 
divine 
reasonableness 
thus 
prescribes 
is 
highly 
general: 
we 
can 
deduce 
from 
it 
only 
certain 
laws 
which 
any 
finite 
things 
must 
obey, 
we 
can 
never 
deduce 
from 
it 
which 
finite 
things 
there 
are 
to 
be, 
nor 
indeed 
that 
there 
are 
to 
be 
any. 
Finite 
things 
are 
particular 
and 
individual: 
each 
of 
them 
might 
have 
been 
other 
than 
it 
is 
or, 
to 
speak 
more 
properly, 
instead 
of 
any 
one 
of 
them 
there 
might 
have 
existed 
something 
else; 
it 
was, 
according 
to 
the 
mere 
principles 
of 
eternal 
reason, 
equally 
possible. 
But 
if 
so, 
the 
whole 
universe, 
being 
made 
up 
of 
things 
each 
of 
which 
might 
be 
otherwise, 
might 
as 
a 
whole 
be 
otherwise. 
Therefore 
the 
divine 
thoughts 
which 
itobeysbyexistinghavethenature 
of 
choices 
or 
decrees. 


What 
material 
does 
the 
finite 
mind 
supply 
for 
an 
analogical 
picture 
of 
the 
infinite 
mind 
making 
choices 
or 
decrees? 
If 
we 
use 
such 
language 
of 
God, 
we 
areusinglanguagewhichhas 
itsfirstandnaturalapplicationtoourselves. 
We 
all 
of 
us 
choose, 
and 
those 
of 
us 
who 
are 
in 
authority 
make 
decrees. 
What 
is 
to 
choose? 
It 
involves 
a 
real 
freedom 
in 
the 
mind. 
A 
finite 
mind, 
let 
us 
remember, 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
self-operating 
succession 
of 
perceptions, 
ideas, 
or 
representations. 
With 
regard 
to 
some 
of 
our 
ideas 
we 
have 
no 
freedom, 
those, 



for 
example, 
which 
represent 
to 
us 
our 
body. 
We 
think 
of 
them 
as 
constituting 
our 
given 
substance. 
They 
are 
sheer 
datum 
for 
us, 
and 
so 
are 
those 
reflexions 
of 
our 
environment 
which 
they 
mediate 
to 
us. 
They 
make 
up 
a 
closely 
packed 
and 
confused 
mass; 
they 
persevere 
in 
their 
being 
with 
an 
obstinate 
innate 
force, 
the 
spiritual 
counterpart 
of 
the 
force 
which 
we 
have 
to 
recognize 
in 
things 
as 
physically 
interpreted. 
Being 
real 
spiritual 
force, 
it 
is 
quasi-voluntary,andindeeddowenotloveourown 
existenceand,inasense, 
will 
it 
in 
all 
its 
necessary 
circumstances? 
But 
if 
we 
can 
be 
said 
to 
will 
to 
be 
ourselves 
and 
to 
enact 
with 
native 
force 
what 
our 
body 
and 
its 
environment 
makes 
us, 
we 
are 
merely 
willing 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
our 
existence; 
we 
are 
making 
no 
choice. 
When, 
however, 
we 
think 
freely 
or 
perform 
deliberate 
acts, 
there 
is 
not 
only 
force 
but 
choice 
in 
our 
activity. 
Choice 
between 
what? 
Between 
alternative 
possibilities 
arising 
out 
of 
our 
situation. 
And 
choice 
in 
virtue 
of 
what? 
In 
virtue 
of 
the 
appeal 
exercised 
by 
one 
alternativeasseeminglybetter. 


Can 
we 
adapt 
our 
scheme 
of 
choice 
to 
the 
description 
of 
God’s 
creative 
decrees? 
We 
will 
take 
the 
second 
point 
in 
it 
first: 
our 
choice 
is 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
appeal 
of 
the 
seeming 
best. 
Surely 
the 
only 
corrective 
necessary 
in 
applying 
this 
to 
God 
is 
the 
omission 
of 
the 
word 
‘seeming’. 
His 
choice 
is 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
appeal 
of 
the 
simply 
best. 
The 
other 
point 
causes 
more 
trouble. 
We 
choose 
between 
possibilities 
which 
arise 
for 
us 
out 
of 
our 
situation 
in 
the 
system 
of 
the 
existing 
world. 
But 
as 
the 
world 
does 
not 
exist 
before 
God’s 
creative 
choices, 
he 
is 
in 
no 
world-situation, 
and 
no 
alternative 
possibilities 
can 
arise 
out 
of 
it, 
between 
which 
he 
should 
have 
to 
choose. 
But 
if 
God 
does 
not 
choose 
between 
intrinsic 
possibilities 
of 
some 
kind, 
his 
choice 
becomes 
something 
absolutely 
meaningless 
to 
us 
— 
it 
is 
not 
a 
choice 
at 
all, 
it 
is 
an 
arbitraryandunintelligible 
fiat. 



Leibniz’ 
solution 
is 
this: 
what 
are 
mere 
possibilities 
of 
thought 
for 
us 
are 
possibilities 
of 
action 
for 
God. 
For 
a 
human 
subject, 
possibilities 
of 
action 
are 
limited 
to 
what 
arises 
out 
of 
his 
actual 
situation, 
but 
possibilities 
for 
thought 
are 
not 
so 
limited. 
I 
can 
conceive 
a 
world 
different 
in 
many 
respects 
from 
this 
world, 
in 
which, 
for 
example, 
vegetables 
should 
be 
gifted 
with 
thought 
and 
speech; 
but 
I 
can 
do 
nothing 
towards 
bringing 
it 
about. 
My 
imaginary 
world 
is 
practically 
impossible 
but 
speculatively 
possible, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
contradicts 
no 
single 
principle 
of 
necessary 
and 
immutable 
reason. 
I, 
indeed, 
can 
explore 
only 
a 
very 
little 
way 
into 
the 
region 
of 
sheer 
speculative 
possibility; 
God 
does 
not 
explore 
it, 
he 
simply 
possesses 
it 
all: 
the 
whole 
region 
of 
the 
possible 
is 
but 
a 
part 
of 
the 
content 
of 
his 
infinite 
mind. 
So 
amongallpossiblecreatureshe 
chooses 
thebestand 
creates 
it. 


But 
the 
whole 
realm 
of 
the 
possible 
is 
an 
actual 
infinity 
of 
ideas. 
Out 
of 
the 
consideration 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
ideas, 
how 
can 
God 
arrive 
at 
a 
choice? 
Why 
not? 
His 
mind 
is 
not, 
of 
course, 
discursive; 
he 
does 
not 
successively 
turn 
over 
the 
leaves 
of 
an 
infinite 
book 
of 
sample 
worlds, 
for 
then 
he 
would 
never 
come 
to 
the 
end 
of 
it. 
Embracing 
infinite 
possibility 
in 
the 
single 
act 
of 
his 
mind, 
he 
settles 
his 
will 
with 
intuitive 
immediacy 
upon 
the 
best. 
The 
inferior, 
the 
monstrous, 
the 
absurd 
is 
not 
a 
wilderness 
through 
which 
he 
painfully 
threads 
his 
way, 
it 
is 
that 
from 
which 
he 
immediately 
turns; 
his 
wisdomis 
his 
elimination 
ofit. 


But 
in 
so 
applying 
the 
scheme 
of 
choice 
to 
God’s 
act, 
have 
we 
not 
invalidated 
its 
application 
to 
our 
own? 
For 
if 
God 
has 
chosen 
the 
whole 
form 
and 
fabric 
of 
the 
world, 
he 
has 
chosen 
everything 
in 
it, 
including 
the 
choices 
we 
shall 
make. 
And 
if 
our 
choices 
have 
already 
been 
chosen 
for 
us 
by 
God, 
it 
would 
seem 
to 
follow 
that 
they 
are 
not 
real 
open 
choices 
on 
our 
part 
at 
all, 
but 
are 
pre-determined. 
And 
if 
they 
are 
pre-determined, 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
they 
are 
not 
really 
even 
choices, 
for 
a 
determined 
choice 
is 
not 
a 
choice. 
But 



if 
we 
do 
not 
ourselves 
exercise 
real 
choice 
in 
any 
degree, 
then 
we 
have 
no 
clue 
to 
what 
any 
choice 
would 
be: 
and 
if 
so, 
we 
have 
no 
power 
of 
conceiving 
divine 
choice,either;andso 
thewholeargumentcuts 
itsownthroat. 


There 
are 
two 
possible 
lines 
of 
escape 
from 
this 
predicament. 
One 
is 
to 
define 
human 
choice 
in 
such 
a 
sense 
that 
it 
allows 
of 
pre-determination 
without 
ceasing 
to 
be 
choice; 
and 
this 
is 
Leibniz’ 
method, 
and 
it 
can 
be 
studied 
at 
length 
in 
the 
Theodicy. 
He 
certainly 
makes 
the 
very 
best 
he 
can 
of 
it, 
and 
it 
hardly 
seems 
that 
any 
of 
those 
contemporaries 
whose 
views 
he 
criticizes 
was 
in 
a 
position 
to 
answer 
him. 
The 
alternative 
method 
is 
to 
make 
the 
most 
of 
the 
negative 
element 
involved 
in 
all 
theology. 
After 
all, 
we 
do 
not 
positively 
or 
adequately 
understand 
the 
nature 
of 
infinite 
creative 
will. 
Perhaps 
it 
is 
precisely 
the 
transcendent 
glory 
of 
divine 
freedom 
to 
be 
able 
to 
work 
infallibly 
through 
free 
instruments. 
But 
so 
mystical 
a 
paradox 
is 
not 
the 
sort 
of 
thing 
we 
can 
expect 
to 
appeal 
to 
a 
late-seventeenth-century 
philosopher. 


One 
criticism 
of 
Leibniz’ 
argument 
we 
cannot 
refrain 
from 
making. 
He 
allows 
himself 
too 
easy 
a 
triumph 
when 
he 
says 
that 
the 
only 
alternative 
to 
a 
choice 
determined 
by 
a 
prevailing 
inclination 
towards 
one 
proposal 
is 
a 
choice 
of 
mere 
caprice. 
There 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
choice 
Leibniz 
never 
so 
much 
as 
considers 
and 
which 
appears 
at 
least 
to 
fall 
quite 
outside 
his 
categories, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
sort 
of 
choice 
exercised 
in 
artistic 
creativity. 
In 
such 
choice 
we 
freely 
feel 
after 
the 
shaping 
of 
a 
scheme, 
we 
do 
not 
arbitrate 
simply 
between 
shaped 
and 
given 
possible 
schemes. 
And 
perhaps 
some 
such 
element 
enters 
into 
all 
our 
choices, 
since 
our 
life 
is 
to 
some 
extent 
freely 
designed 
by 
ourselves. 
If 
so, 
our 
minds 
are 
even 
more 
akin 
to 
the 
divine 
mind 
than 
Leibniz 
realized. 
For 
the 
sort 
of 
choice 
we 
are 
now 
referring 
to 
seems 
to 
be 
an 
intuitive 
turning 
away 
from 
an 
infinite, 
or 
at 
least 
indefinite, 
range 
of 
less 
attractivepossibility. 
Andsuchisthenatureofthedivine 
creativechoice. 
The 



consequence 
of 
such 
a 
line 
of 
speculation 
would 
be, 
that 
the 
divine 
mind 
designs 
more 
through 
us, 
and 
less 
simply 
for 
us, 
than 
Leibniz 
allowed: 
the 
‘harmony’ 
into 
which 
we 
enter 
would 
be 
no 
longer 
simply 
‘pre-established’. 
Leibniz, 
in 
fact, 
could 
have 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
such 
a 
suggestion, 
and 
he 
would 
have 
found 
it 
easy 
to 
be 
ironical 
about 
it 
if 
his 
contemporaries 
had 
proposedit. 


II 


Leibniz 
wrote 
two 
books; 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 
articles 
in 
learned 
periodicals; 
and 
an 
enormous 
number 
of 
unpublished 
notes, 
papers 
and 
letters, 
preserved 
in 
the 
archives 
of 
the 
Electors 
of 
Hanover 
not 
because 
of 
the 
philosophical 
significance 
of 
some 
of 
them, 
but 
because 
of 
the 
political 
importance 
of 
most 
of 
them. 
From 
among 
this 
great 
mass 
various 
excerpts 
of 
philosophical 
interest 
have 
been 
made 
by 
successive 
editors 
of 
Leibniz’ 
works. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
the 
most 
profound 
understanding 
of 
his 
mind 
is 
to 
be 
derived 
from 
some 
of 
these 
pieces, 
but 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
consider 
the 
public 
historyof 
Leibniz, 
we 
maysetthemaside. 


Of 
the 
two 
books, 
one 
was 
published, 
and 
the 
other 
never 
was. 
The 
New 
Essays 
remained 
in 
Leibniz’ 
desk, 
the 
Theodicy 
saw 
the 
light. 
And 
so, 
to 
his 
own 
and 
the 
succeeding 
generation, 
Leibniz 
was 
known 
as 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Theodicy. 


The 
articles 
in 
journals 
form 
the 
immediate 
background 
to 
the 
two 
books. 
In 
1696 
Leibniz 
heard 
that 
a 
French 
translation 
of 
Locke’s 
Essay 
concerning 
Human 
Understanding 
was 
being 
prepared 
at 
Amsterdam. 
He 
wrote 
some 
polite 
comments 
on 
Locke’s 
great 
work, 
and 
published 
them. 
He 
also 
sent 
them 
to 
Locke, 
hoping 
that 
Locke 
would 
write 
a 
reply, 
and 
that 
Leibniz’ 
reflexions 
and 
Locke’s 
reply 
might 
be 
appended 
to 
the 
projected 
French 
translation. 
But 
Locke 
set 
Leibniz’ 
comments 
aside. 
Leibniz, 
not 
to 
be 



defeated, 
set 
to 
work 
upon 
the 
New 
Essays, 
in 
which 
the 
whole 
substance 
of 
Locke’s 
book 
is 
systematically 
discussed 
in 
dialogue. 
The 
New 
Essays 
were 
written 
in 
1703. 
But 
meanwhile 
a 
painful 
dispute 
had 
broken 
out 
between 
Leibniz 
and 
the 
disciples 
of 
Locke 
and 
Newton, 
in 
which 
the 
English, 
and 
perhaps 
Newton 
himself, 
were 
much 
to 
blame, 
and 
Leibniz 
thought 
it 
impolitic 
to 
publish 
his 
book. 
It 
was 
not 
issued 
until 
long 
after 
his 
death, 
in 
themiddleofthecentury. 


The 
discussion 
with 
Locke 
was 
a 
failure: 
Locke 
would 
not 
play, 
and 
the 
book 
in 
which 
the 
whole 
controversy 
was 
to 
be 
systematized 
never 
appeared. 
The 
discussion 
with 
Bayle, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
was 
a 
model 
of 
what 
a 
discussion 
should 
be. 
Bayle 
played 
up 
tirelessly, 
and 
was 
never 
embarrassingly 
profound; 
he 
provided 
just 
the 
sort 
of 
objections 
most 
useful 
for 
drawing 
forth 
illuminating 
expositions; 
he 
was 
as 
good 
as 
a 
fictitious 
character 
in 
a 
philosophical 
dialogue. 
And 
the 
book 
in 
which 
the 
controversy 
was 
systematizedduly 
appearedwithgreatéclat. 


Here 
is 
the 
history 
of 
the 
controversy. 
In 
1695 
Leibniz 
was 
forty-nine 
years 
old. 
He 
had 
just 
emerged 
from 
a 
period 
of 
close 
employment 
under 
his 
prince’s 
commands, 
and 
he 
thoughtfit 
to 
try 
hismetaphysicalprinciples 
upon 
the 
polite 
world 
and 
see 
what 
would 
come 
of 
it. 
He 
therefore 
published 
an 
article 
in 
the 
Journal 
des 
Savants 
under 
the 
title: 
‘New 
System 
of 
Nature 
and 
of 
the 
Communication 
of 
Substances, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
Union 
between 
Soul 
and 
Body’. 
In 
the 
same 
year 
Foucher 
published 
an 
article 
in 
the 
Journal 
controverting 
Leibniz; 
and 
in 
the 
next 
year 
Leibniz 
replied 
with 
an 
‘Explanation’. 
A 
second 
explanation 
in 
the 
same 
year 
appeared 
in 
Basnage’s 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants, 
in 
answer 
to 
reflexions 
by 
the 
editor. 
M. 
Pierre 
Bayle 
had 
all 
these 
articles 
before 
him 
when 
he 
inserted 
a 
note 
on 
Leibniz’ 
doctrine 
in 
his 
article 
on 
‘Rorarius’, 
in 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
his 
Historical 
and 
Critical 
Dictionary. 
The 
point 
of 
connexion 
between 
Rorarius 



and 
Leibniz 
was 
no 
more 
than 
this, 
that 
both 
held 
views 
about 
the 
souls 
of 
beasts. 


Pierre 
Bayle 
was 
the 
son 
of 
a 
Calvinist 
pastor, 
early 
converted 
to 
Catholicism, 
but 
recovered 
to 
his 
old 
faith 
after 
a 
short 
time. 
He 
held 
academic 
employments 
in 
Switzerland 
and 
Holland; 
he 
promoted 
and 
edited 
the 
Nouvelles 
de 
la 
République 
des 
Lettres, 
and 
he 
produced 
that 
extraordinary 
work 
the 
Historical 
and 
Critical 
Dictionary. 
The 
notices 
it 
contains 
of 
authors 
and 
thinkers 
are 
little 
more 
than 
pegs 
upon 
which 
Bayle 
could 
hang 
his 
philosophical 
reflexions. 
He 
could 
write 
an 
intelligent 
discussion 
on 
any 
opinion; 
what 
he 
could 
not 
do 
was 
to 
reconcile 
the 
points 
of 
view 
from 
which 
he 
felt 
impelled 
to 
write 
upon 
this 
author 
and 
that. 
His 
was 
not 
a 
systematic 
mind. 
So 
far 
as 
he 
had 
a 
philosophical 
opinion, 
he 
was 
a 
Cartesian; 
in 
theology 
he 
was 
an 
orthodox 
Calvinist. 
He 
could 
not 
reconcile 
his 
theology 
with 
his 
Cartesianism 
and 
he 
did 
not 
try 
to. 
He 
made 
a 
merit 
of 
the 
oppositions 
of 
faith 
to 
reason 
and 
reason 
to 
itself, 
so 
that 
he 
could 
throw 
himselfuponameritoriousandvoluntaryfaith. 


There 
is 
nothing 
original 
in 
this 
position. 
It 
was 
characteristic 
of 
decadent 
scholasticism, 
it 
squared 
with 
Luther’s 
exaggerations 
about 
the 
impotence 
of 
reason 
in 
fallen 
man, 
and 
Pascal 
had 
givenhis 
own 
highly 
personal 
twisttoit. 
Bayle 
has 
been 
hailed 
as 
a 
forerunner 
of 
Voltairean 
scepticism. 
It 
would 
be 
truer 
to 
say 
that 
a 
Voltairean 
sceptic 
could 
read 
Bayle’s 
discussions 
in 
his 
own 
sense 
and 
for 
his 
own 
purposes 
if 
he 
wished. 
But 
Bayle 
was 
not 
a 
sceptic. 
It 
is 
hard 
to 
say 
what 
he 
was; 
his 
whole 
position 
as 
between 
faith 
and 
reason 
is 
hopelessly 
confused. 
He 
was 
a 
scholar, 
a 
wit, 
and 
a 
philosophical 
sparring-partner 
of 
so 
perfectly 
convenient 
a 
kind 
that 
if 
we 
had 
not 
evidence 
ofhishistoricalreality,wemighthavesuspectedLeibnizofinventinghim. 


In 
the 
first 
edition 
of 
his 
Dictionary, 
under 
the 
article 
‘Rorarius’, 
Bayle 
gave 
a 
very 
fair 
account 
of 
Leibniz’ 
doctrine 
concerning 
the 
souls 
of 
animals, 



as 
it 
could 
be 
collected 
from 
his 
article 
in 
the 
Journal 
des 
Savants, 
27 
June 
1695. 
Hethenproceeded 
tocommentuponitinthefollowingterms: 


‘There 
are 
some 
things 
in 
Mr. 
Leibniz’ 
hypothesis 
that 
are 
liable 
to 
some 
difficulties, 
though 
they 
show 
the 
great 
extent 
of 
his 
genius. 
He 
will 
have 
it, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
dog 
acts 
independently 
of 
outward 
bodies; 
that 
it 
stands 
upon 
its 
own 
bottom, 
by 
a 
perfect 
spontaneity 
with 
respect 
to 
itself, 
and 
yet 
with 
a 
perfect 
conformity 
to 
outward 
things.... 
That 
its 
internal 
perceptions 
arise 
from 
its 
original 
constitution, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
representative 
constitution 
(capable 
of 
expressing 
beings 
outside 
itself 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
organs) 
which 
was 
bestowed 
upon 
it 
from 
the 
time 
of 
its 
creation, 
and 
makes 
its 
individual 
character 
(Journal 
des 
Savants, 
4 
July 
1695). 
From 
whence 
it 
results 
that 
it 
would 
feel 
hunger 
and 
thirst 
at 
such 
and 
such 
an 
hour, 
though 
there 
were 
not 
any 
one 
body 
in 
the 
universe, 
and 
though 
nothing 
should 
exist 
but 
God 
and 
that 
soul. 
He 
has 
explained 
(Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants, 
Feb. 
1696) 
his 
thought 
by 
the 
example 
of 
two 
pendulums 
that 
should 
perfectly 
agree: 
that 
is, 
he 
supposes 
that 
according 
to 
the 
particular 
laws 
which 
put 
the 
soul 
upon 
action, 
it 
must 
feel 
hunger 
at 
such 
an 
hour; 
and 
that 
according 
to 
the 
particular 
laws 
which 
direct 
the 
motion 
of 
matter, 
the 
body 
which 
is 
united 
to 
that 
soul 
must 
be 
modified 
at 
that 
same 
hour 
as 
it 
is 
modified 
when 
the 
soul 
is 
hungry. 
I 
will 
forbear 
preferring 
this 
system 
to 
that 
of 
occasional 
causes 
till 
the 
learned 
author 
has 
perfected 
it. 
I 
cannot 
apprehend 
the 
connexion 
of 
internal 
and 
spontaneous 
actions 
which 
would 
have 
this 
effect, 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
dog 
would 
feel 
pain 
immediately 
after 
having 
felt 
joy, 
though 
it 
were 
alone 
in 
the 
universe. 
I 
understand 
why 
a 
dog 
passes 
immediately 
from 
pleasure 
to 
pain 
when, 
being 
very 
hungry 
and 
eating 
a 
piece 
of 
bread, 
he 
is 
suddenly 
struck 
with 
a 
cudgel. 
But 
I 
cannot 
apprehend 
that 
his 
soul 
should 
be 
so 
framed 
that 
at 
the 
very 
moment 
of 
his 
being 
beaten 
he 
should 
feel 
pain 
though 
he 
were 
not 
beaten, 



and 
though 
he 
should 
continue 
to 
eat 
bread 
without 
any 
trouble 
or 
hindrance. 
Nor 
do 
I 
see 
how 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
that 
soul 
should 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
senseofpain,and 
ingeneralwithanyunpleasing 
perceptions. 


‘Besides, 
the 
reason 
why 
this 
learned 
man 
does 
not 
like 
the 
Cartesian 
system 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
a 
false 
supposition; 
for 
it 
cannot 
be 
said 
that 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes 
brings 
in 
God 
acting 
by 
a 
miracle 
(ibid.), 
Deum 
ex 
machina, 
in 
the 
mutual 
dependency 
of 
the 
body 
and 
soul: 
for 
since 
God 
does 
only 
intervene 
according 
to 
general 
laws, 
he 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
act 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
manner. 
Does 
the 
internal 
and 
active 
virtue 
communicated 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
bodies 
according 
to 
M. 
Leibniz 
know 
the 
train 
of 
actions 
which 
it 
is 
to 
produce? 
By 
no 
means; 
for 
we 
know 
by 
experience 
that 
we 
are 
ignorant 
whether 
we 
shall 
have 
such 
and 
such 
perceptions 
in 
an 
hour’s 
time. 
It 
were 
therefore 
necessary 
that 
the 
forms 
should 
be 
directed 
by 
some 
internal 
principle 
in 
the 
production 
of 
their 
acts. 
But 
this 
would 
be 
Deus 
ex 
machina, 
as 
much 
as 
in 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes. 
In 
fine, 
as 
he 
supposes 
with 
great 
reason 
that 
all 
souls 
are 
simple 
and 
indivisible, 
it 
cannot 
be 
apprehended 
how 
they 
can 
be 
compared 
with 
a 
pendulum, 
that 
is, 
how 
by 
their 
original 
constitution 
they 
can 
diversify 
their 
operations 
by 
using 
the 
spontaneous 
activity 
bestowed 
upon 
them 
by 
their 
Creator. 
It 
may 
clearly 
be 
conceived 
that 
a 
simple 
being 
will 
always 
act 
in 
a 
uniform 
manner, 
if 
no 
external 
cause 
hinders 
it. 
If 
it 
were 
composed 
of 
several 
pieces, 
as 
a 
machine, 
it 
would 
act 
different 
ways, 
because 
the 
peculiar 
activity 
of 
each 
piece 
might 
change 
every 
moment 
the 
progress 
of 
others; 
but 
how 
will 
you 
find 
in 
a 
simplesubstancethecauseofachangeof 
operation?’ 


Leibniz 
published 
a 
reply 
to 
Bayle 
in 
the 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants 
for 
July 
1698. 
As 
in 
all 
his 
references 
to 
Bayle, 
he 
is 
studiously 
polite 
and 
repays 
compliment 
for 
compliment. 
The 
following 
are 
perhaps 
the 
principalpointsofhisanswer. 



1. 
Ontheexampleof 
the 
dog: 
(a) 
How 
should 
it 
of 
itself 
change 
its 
sentiment, 
since 
everything 
left 
to 
itself 
continues 
in 
the 
state 
in 
which 
it 
is? 
Because 
the 
state 
may 
be 
a 
state 
of 
change, 
as 
in 
a 
moving 
body 
which, 
unless 
hindered, 
continues 
to 
move. 
And 
suchisthenatureof 
simplesubstances 
—theycontinuetoevolve 
steadily. 
(b) 
Would 
it 
really 
feel 
as 
though 
beaten 
if 
it 
were 
not 
beaten, 
since 
Leibniz 
says 
that 
the 
action 
of 
every 
substance 
takes 
place 
as 
though 
nothing 
existed 
but 
God 
and 
itself? 
Leibniz 
replies 
that 
his 
remark 
refers 
to 
the 
causalitybehind 
anaction, 
not 
tothereasonsforit. 
Thespontaneousactionof 
thedog, 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
feelingofpain,is 
only 
decreed 
to 
bewhat 
it 
is, 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
the 
dog 
is 
part 
of 
a 
world 
of 
mutually 
reflecting 
substances, 
a 
worldwhichalsoincludes 
thecudgel. 
(c) 
Why 
should 
the 
dog 
ever 
be 
displeased 
spontaneously? 
Leibniz 
distinguishes 
the 
spontaneous 
from 
the 
voluntary: 
many 
things 
occur 
in 
the 
mind,of 
itself,butnotchosenbyit. 
2. 
OnCartesianismandmiracle: 
Cartesianism 
in 
the 
form 
of 
occasionalism 
does 
involve 
miracle, 
for 
though 
God 
is 
said 
by 
it 
to 
act 
according 
to 
laws 
in 
conforming 
body 
and 
mind 
to 
one 
another, 
he 
thereby 
causes 
them 
to 
act 
beyond 
their 
natural 
capacities. 


3. 
Ontheproblem,howcanthesimpleactotherwisethanuniformly? 
Leibniz 
distinguishes: 
some 
uniform 
action 
is 
monotonous, 
but 
some 
is 
not. 
A 
point 
moves 
uniformly 
in 
describing 
a 
parabola, 
for 
it 
constantly 
fulfils 
the 
formula 
of 
the 
curve. 
But 
it 
does 
not 
move 
monotonously, 
for 
the 
curve 
constantly 
varies. 
Such 
is 
the 
uniformity 
of 
the 
action 
of 
simple 
substances. 


Bayle 
read 
this 
reply, 
and 
was 
pleased 
but 
not 
satisfied 
with 
it. 
In 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
dictionary, 
under 
the 
same 
article 
‘Rorarius’, 
he 
added 



thefollowingnote: 


‘I 
declare 
first 
of 
all 
that 
I 
am 
very 
glad 
I 
have 
proposed 
some 
small 
difficulties 
against 
the 
system 
of 
that 
great 
philosopher, 
since 
they 
have 
occasioned 
some 
answers 
whereby 
that 
subject 
has 
been 
made 
clearer 
to 
me, 
and 
which 
have 
given 
me 
a 
more 
distinct 
notion 
of 
what 
is 
most 
to 
be 
admired 
in 
it. 
I 
look 
now 
upon 
that 
new 
system 
as 
an 
important 
conquest, 
which 
enlarges 
the 
bounds 
of 
philosophy. 
We 
had 
only 
two 
hypotheses, 
that 
of 
the 
Schools 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Cartesians: 
the 
one 
was 
a 
way 
of 
influence 
of 
the 
body 
upon 
the 
soul 
and 
of 
the 
soul 
upon 
the 
body; 
the 
other 
was 
a 
way 
of 
assistance 
or 
occasional 
causality. 
But 
here 
is 
a 
new 
acquisition, 
a 
new 
hypothesis, 
which 
may 
be 
called, 
as 
Fr. 
Lami 
styles 
it, 
a 
way 
of 
preestablished 
harmony. 
We 
are 
beholden 
for 
it 
to 
M. 
Leibniz, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
conceive 
anything 
that 
gives 
us 
a 
nobler 
idea 
of 
the 
power 
and 
wisdom 
of 
the 
Author 
of 
all 
things. 
This, 
together 
with 
the 
advantage 
of 
setting 
aside 
all 
notions 
of 
a 
miraculous 
conduct, 
would 
engage 
me 
to 
prefer 
this 
new 
system 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Cartesians, 
if 
I 
could 
conceive 
any 
possibility 
inthe 
way 
of 
pre-established 
harmony. 


‘I 
desire 
the 
reader 
to 
take 
notice 
that 
though 
I 
confess 
that 
this 
way 
removes 
all 
notions 
of 
a 
miraculous 
conduct, 
yet 
I 
do 
not 
retract 
what 
I 
have 
said 
formerly, 
that 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes 
does 
not 
bring 
in 
God 
acting 
miraculously. 
(See 
M. 
Leibniz’ 
article 
in 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants, 
July 
1698.) 
I 
am 
as 
much 
persuaded 
as 
ever 
I 
was 
that 
an 
action 
cannotbe 
saidto 
bemiraculous,unlessGod 
producesit 
asanexceptionto 
the 
general 
laws; 
and 
that 
everything 
of 
which 
he 
is 
immediately 
the 
author 
according 
to 
those 
laws 
is 
distinct 
from 
a 
miracle 
properly 
so 
called. 
But 
being 
willing 
to 
cut 
off 
from 
this 
dispute 
as 
many 
things 
as 
I 
possibly 
can, 
I 
consent 
it 
should 
be 
said 
that 
the 
surest 
way 
of 
removing 
all 
notions 
that 
include 
a 
miracle 
is 
to 
suppose 
that 
all 
created 
substances 
are 
actively 
the 



immediate 
causes 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
nature. 
I 
will 
therefore 
lay 
aside 
what 
I 
mightreply 
tothatpartof 
M. 
Leibniz’ 
answer. 


‘I 
will 
also 
omit 
all 
objections 
which 
are 
not 
more 
contrary 
to 
his 
opinion 
than 
to 
that 
of 
some 
other 
philosophers. 
I 
will 
not 
therefore 
propose 
the 
difficulties 
that 
may 
be 
raised 
against 
the 
supposition 
that 
a 
creature 
can 
receive 
from 
God 
the 
power 
of 
moving 
itself. 
They 
are 
strong 
and 
almost 
unanswerable, 
but 
M. 
Leibniz’ 
system 
does 
not 
lie 
more 
open 
to 
them 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Aristotelians; 
nay, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
the 
Cartesians 
would 
presume 
to 
say 
that 
God 
cannot 
communicate 
to 
our 
souls 
a 
power 
of 
acting. 
If 
they 
say 
so, 
how 
can 
they 
own 
that 
Adam 
sinned? 
And 
if 
they 
dare 
not 
say 
so 
they 
weaken 
the 
arguments 
whereby 
they 
endeavour 
to 
provethatmatter 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
any 
activity. 
Nor 
do 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
more 
difficult 
for 
M. 
Leibniz 
than 
for 
the 
Cartesians 
or 
other 
philosophers, 
to 
free 
himself 
from 
the 
objection 
of 
a 
fatal 
mechanism 
which 
destroys 
human 
liberty. 
Wherefore, 
waiving 
this, 
I 
shall 
only 
speak 
of 
what 
is 
peculiar 
to 
the 
system 
of 
the 
preestablished 
harmony. 


‘I. 
My 
first 
observation 
shall 
be, 
that 
it 
raises 
the 
power 
and 
wisdom 
of 
the 
divine 
art 
above 
everything 
that 
can 
be 
conceived. 
Fancy 
to 
yourself 
a 
ship 
which, 
without 
having 
any 
sense 
or 
knowledge, 
and 
without 
being 
directed 
by 
any 
created 
or 
uncreated 
being, 
has 
the 
power 
of 
moving 
itself 
so 
seasonably 
as 
to 
have 
always 
the 
wind 
favourable, 
to 
avoid 
currents 
and 
rocks, 
to 
cast 
anchor 
where 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
done, 
and 
to 
retire 
into 
a 
harbour 
precisely 
when 
it 
is 
necessary. 
Suppose 
such 
a 
ship 
sails 
in 
that 
manner 
for 
several 
years 
successively, 
being 
always 
turned 
and 
situated 
as 
it 
ought 
to 
be, 
according 
to 
the 
several 
changes 
of 
the 
air 
and 
the 
different 
situations 
of 
seas 
and 
lands; 
you 
will 
acknowledge 
that 
God, 
notwithstanding 
his 
infinite 
power, 
cannot 
communicate 
such 
a 
faculty 
to 
a 
ship; 
or 
rather 
you 
will 
say 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
ship 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
receiving 
it 
from 
God. 
And 
yet 
what 



M. 
Leibniz 
supposes 
about 
the 
machine 
of 
a 
human 
body 
is 
more 
admirable 
and 
more 
surprising 
than 
all 
this. 
Let 
us 
apply 
his 
system 
concerning 
the 
unionofthesoulwiththebodyto 
thepersonofJuliusCaesar. 
‘II. 
We 
must 
say 
according 
to 
this 
system 
that 
the 
body 
of 
Julius 
Caesar 
did 
so 
exercise 
its 
moving 
faculty 
that 
from 
its 
birth 
to 
its 
death 
it 
went 
through 
continual 
changes 
which 
did 
most 
exactly 
answer 
the 
perpetual 
changes 
of 
a 
certain 
soul 
which 
it 
did 
not 
know 
and 
which 
made 
no 
impression 
on 
it. 
We 
must 
say 
that 
the 
rule 
according 
to 
which 
that 
faculty 
of 
Caesar’s 
body 
performed 
such 
actions 
was 
such, 
that 
he 
would 
have 
gone 
to 
the 
Senate 
upon 
such 
a 
day 
and 
at 
such 
an 
hour, 
that 
he 
would 
have 
spoken 
there 
such 
and 
such 
words, 
etc. 
though 
God 
had 
willed 
to 
annihilate 
his 
soul 
the 
next 
day 
after 
it 
was 
created. 
We 
must 
say 
that 
this 
moving 
power 
did 
change 
and 
modify 
itself 
exactly 
according 
to 
the 
volubility 
of 
the 
thoughts 
of 
that 
ambitious 
man, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
affected 
precisely 
in 
a 
certain 
manner 
rather 
than 
in 
another, 
because 
the 
soul 
of 
Caesar 
passed 
from 
a 
certain 
thought 
to 
another. 
Can 
a 
blind 
power 
modify 
itself 
so 
exactly 
by 
virtue 
of 
an 
impression 
communicated 
thirty 
or 
forty 
years 
before 
and 
never 
renewed 
since, 
but 
left 
to 
itself, 
without 
ever 
knowing 
what 
it 
is 
to 
do? 
Is 
not 
this 
much 
more 
incomprehensible 
than 
the 
navigation 
I 
spoke 
of 
in 
the 
foregoing 
paragraph? 


‘III. 
The 
difficulty 
will 
be 
greater 
still, 
if 
it 
be 
considered 
that 
the 
human 
machine 
contains 
an 
almost 
infinite 
number 
of 
organs, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
continually 
exposed 
to 
the 
shock 
of 
the 
bodies 
that 
surround 
it, 
and 
which 
by 
an 
innumerable 
variety 
of 
shakings 
produce 
in 
it 
a 
thousand 
sorts 
of 
modifications. 
How 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
conceive 
that 
this 
pre-established 
harmony 
should 
never 
be 
disordered, 
but 
go 
on 
still 
during 
the 
longest 
life 
of 
a 
man, 
notwithstanding 
the 
infinite 
varieties 
of 
the 
reciprocal 
action 
of 
so 
many 
organs 
upon 
one 
another, 
which 
are 
surrounded 
on 
all 
sides 
with 



infinite 
corpuscles, 
sometimes 
hot 
and 
sometimes 
cold, 
sometimes 
dry 
and 
sometimes 
moist, 
and 
always 
acting, 
and 
pricking 
the 
nerves 
a 
thousand 
different 
ways? 
Suppose 
that 
the 
multiplicity 
of 
organs 
and 
of 
external 
agents 
beanecessaryinstrument 
ofthealmostinfinitevarietyof 
changesina 
human 
body: 
will 
that 
variety 
have 
the 
exactness 
here 
required? 
Will 
it 
never 
disturb 
the 
correspondence 
of 
those 
changes 
with 
the 
changes 
of 
the 
soul? 
This 
seems 
tobealtogetherimpossible. 


‘According 
to 
M. 
Leibniz 
what 
is 
active 
in 
every 
substance 
ought 
to 
be 
reducedto 
atrue 
unity. 
Since 
therefore 
the 
body 
of 
every 
man 
is 
composed 
of 
several 
substances, 
each 
of 
them 
ought 
to 
have 
a 
principle 
of 
action 
really 
distinct 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
each 
of 
the 
others. 
He 
will 
have 
the 
action 
of 
every 
principle 
to 
be 
spontaneous. 
Now 
this 
must 
vary 
the 
effects 
ad 
infinitum, 
and 
confound 
them. 
For 
the 
impression 
of 
the 
neighbouring 
bodies 
must 
needs 
put 
some 
constraint 
upon 
the 
natural 
spontaneity 
of 
every 
one 
of 
them.’ 


‘IV. 
Itisin 
vain 
to 
haverecourse 
to 
thepower 
of 
God, 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
that 
brutes 
are 
mere 
machines; 
it 
is 
in 
vain 
to 
say 
that 
God 
was 
able 
to 
make 
machines 
so 
artfully 
contrived 
that 
the 
voice 
of 
a 
man, 
the 
reflected 
light 
of 
an 
object, 
etc. 
will 
strike 
them 
exactly 
where 
it 
is 
necessary, 
that 
they 
may 
move 
in 
a 
given 
manner. 
This 
supposition 
is 
rejected 
by 
everybody 
except 
some 
Cartesians; 
and 
no 
Cartesian 
would 
admit 
it 
if 
it 
were 
to 
be 
extended 
to 
man; 
that 
is, 
if 
anyone 
were 
to 
assert 
that 
God 
was 
able 
to 
form 
such 
bodies 
as 
would 
mechanically 
do 
whatever 
we 
see 
other 
men 
do. 
By 
denying 
this 
we 
do 
not 
pretend 
to 
limit 
the 
power 
and 
knowledge 
of 
God: 
we 
only 
mean 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
does 
not 
permit 
that 
the 
faculties 
imparted 
to 
a 
creature 
should 
not 
be 
necessarily 
confined 
within 
certain 
bounds. 
The 
actions 
of 
creatures 
must 
be 
necessarily 
proportioned 
to 
their 
essential 
state, 
and 
performed 
according 
to 
the 
character 
belonging 
to 
each 
machine; 
for 



according 
to 
the 
maxim 
of 
the 
philosophers, 
whatever 
is 
received 
is 
proportionate 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
subject 
that 
receives 
it. 
We 
may 
therefore 
reject 
M. 
Leibniz’ 
hypothesis 
as 
being 
impossible, 
since 
it 
is 
liable 
to 
greater 
difficulties 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Cartesians, 
which 
makes 
beasts 
to 
be 
mere 
machines. 
It 
puts 
a 
perpetual 
harmony 
between 
two 
beings, 
which 
do 
not 
act 
one 
upon 
another; 
whereas 
if 
servants 
were 
mere 
machines, 
and 
should 
punctually 
obey 
their 
masters’ 
command, 
it 
could 
not 
be 
said 
that 
they 
do 
it 
without 
a 
real 
action 
of 
their 
masters 
upon 
them; 
for 
their 
masters 
would 
speak 
words 
and 
make 
signs 
which 
would 
really 
shake 
and 
move 
the 
organs 
oftheservants. 


‘V. 
Now 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
soul 
of 
Julius 
Caesar, 
and 
we 
shall 
find 
the 
thing 
more 
impossible 
still. 
Thatsoulwasinthe 
world 
without 
being 
exposed 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
any 
spirit. 
The 
power 
it 
received 
from 
God 
was 
the 
only 
principle 
of 
the 
actions 
it 
produced 
at 
every 
moment: 
and 
if 
those 
actions 
were 
different 
one 
from 
another, 
it 
was 
not 
because 
some 
of 
them 
were 
produced 
by 
the 
united 
influence 
of 
some 
springs 
which 
did 
not 
contribute 
to 
the 
production 
of 
others, 
for 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
is 
simple, 
indivisible 
and 
immaterial. 
M. 
Leibniz 
owns 
it; 
and 
if 
he 
did 
not 
acknowledge 
it, 
but 
if, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
he 
should 
suppose 
with 
most 
philosophers 
and 
some 
of 
the 
most 
excellent 
metaphysicians 
of 
our 
age 
(Mr. 
Locke, 
for 
instance) 
that 
a 
compound 
of 
several 
material 
parts 
placed 
and 
disposed 
in 
a 
certain 
manner, 
is 
capable 
of 
thinking, 
his 
hypothesis 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
on 
that 
very 
ground 
absolutely 
impossible, 
and 
I 
could 
refute 
it 
several 
other 
ways; 
which 
I 
need 
not 
mention 
since 
he 
acknowledges 
the 
immateriality 
of 
our 
soul 
and 
builds 
uponit. 


‘Let 
us 
return 
to 
the 
soul 
of 
Julius 
Caesar, 
and 
call 
it 
an 
immaterial 
automaton 
(M. 
Leibniz’ 
own 
phrase), 
and 
compare 
it 
with 
an 
atom 
of 
Epicurus; 
I 
mean 
an 
atom 
surrounded 
with 
a 
vacuum 
on 
all 
sides, 
and 
which 



will 
never 
meet 
any 
other 
atom. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
just 
comparison: 
for 
this 
atom, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
has 
a 
natural 
power 
of 
moving 
itself 
and 
exerts 
it 
without 
any 
assistance, 
and 
without 
being 
retarded 
or 
hindered 
by 
anything: 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
soul 
of 
Caesar 
is 
a 
spirit 
which 
has 
received 
the 
faculty 
of 
producing 
thoughts, 
and 
exerts 
it 
without 
the 
influence 
of 
any 
other 
spirit 
or 
of 
any 
body. 
It 
is 
neither 
assisted 
nor 
thwarted 
by 
anything 
whatsoever. 
If 
you 
consult 
the 
common 
notions 
and 
the 
ideas 
of 
order, 
you 
will 
find 
that 
this 
atom 
can 
never 
stop, 
and 
that 
having 
been 
in 
motion 
in 
the 
foregoing 
moment, 
it 
will 
continue 
in 
it 
at 
the 
present 
moment 
and 
in 
all 
the 
moments 
that 
shall 
follow, 
and 
that 
it 
will 
always 
move 
in 
the 
same 
manner. 
This 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
an 
axiom 
approved 
by 
M. 
Leibniz: 
since 
a 
thing 
does 
always 
remain 
in 
the 
same 
state 
wherein 
it 
happens 
to 
be, 
unless 
it 
receives 
some 
alteration 
from 
some 
other 
thing... 
we 
conclude, 
says 
he, 
not 
only 
that 
a 
body 
which 
is 
at 
rest 
will 
always 
be 
at 
rest, 
but 
that 
a 
body 
in 
motion 
will 
always 
keep 
that 
motion 
or 
change, 
that 
is, 
the 
same 
swiftness 
and 
the 
same 
direction, 
unless 
something 
happens 
to 
hinder 
it. 
(M. 
Leibniz,ibid.) 


‘Everyone 
clearly 
sees 
that 
this 
atom, 
whether 
it 
moves 
by 
an 
innate 
power, 
as 
Democritus 
and 
Epicurus 
would 
have 
it, 
or 
by 
a 
power 
received 
from 
the 
Creator, 
will 
always 
move 
in 
the 
same 
line 
equally 
and 
after 
a 
uniform 
manner, 
without 
ever 
turning 
or 
going 
back. 
Epicurus 
was 
laughed 
at, 
when 
he 
invented 
the 
motion 
of 
declination; 
it 
was 
a 
needless 
supposition, 
which 
he 
wanted 
in 
order 
to 
get 
out 
of 
the 
labyrinth 
of 
a 
fatal 
necessity; 
and 
he 
could 
give 
no 
reason 
for 
this 
new 
part 
of 
his 
system. 
It 
was 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
clearest 
notions 
of 
our 
minds: 
for 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
an 
atom 
which 
describes 
a 
straight 
line 
for 
the 
space 
of 
two 
days 
cannot 
turn 
away 
at 
the 
beginningofathird, 
unlessitmeetswith 
someobstacle, 
orhas 
a 
mindall 
ofa 
sudden 
to 
go 
out 
of 
its 
road, 
or 
contains 
some 
spring 
which 
begins 
to 
play 
at 
that 
very 
moment. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
reasons 
cannot 
be 
admitted 
in 
a 
vacuum. 



The 
second 
is 
impossible, 
since 
an 
atom 
has 
not 
the 
faculty 
of 
thinking. 
And 
the 
third 
is 
likewise 
impossible 
in 
a 
corpuscle 
that 
is 
a 
perfect 
unity. 
I 
must 
makesomeuseofallthis. 


‘VI. 
Caesar’s 
soul 
is 
a 
being 
to 
which 
unity 
belongs 
in 
a 
strict 
sense. 
The 
faculty 
of 
producing 
thoughts 
is 
a 
property 
of 
its 
nature 
(so 
M. 
Leibniz), 
which 
it 
has 
received 
from 
God, 
both 
as 
to 
possession 
and 
exercise. 
If 
the 
first 
thought 
it 
produces 
is 
a 
sense 
of 
pleasure, 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
the 
second 
should 
not 
likewise 
be 
a 
sense 
of 
pleasure; 
for 
when 
the 
total 
cause 
of 
an 
effect 
remains 
the 
same, 
the 
effect 
cannot 
be 
altered. 
Now 
this 
soul, 
at 
the 
second 
moment 
of 
its 
existence, 
does 
not 
receive 
a 
new 
faculty 
of 
thinking; 
it 
only 
preserves 
the 
faculty 
it 
had 
at 
the 
first 
moment, 
and 
it 
is 
as 
independent 
of 
the 
concourse 
of 
any 
other 
cause 
at 
the 
second 
moment 
as 
it 
was 
at 
the 
first. 
It 
must 
therefore 
produce 
again 
at 
the 
second 
moment 
the 
same 
thought 
it 
had 
produced 
just 
before. 
If 
it 
be 
objected 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
in 
a 
state 
of 
change, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
in 
such 
a 
state, 
in 
the 
case 
that 
I 
have 
supposed; 
I 
answer 
that 
its 
change 
will 
be 
like 
the 
change 
of 
the 
atom; 
for 
an 
atom 
which 
continually 
moves 
in 
the 
same 
line 
acquires 
a 
new 
situation 
at 
every 
moment, 
but 
it 
is 
like 
the 
preceding 
situation. 
A 
soul 
may 
therefore 
continue 
in 
its 
state 
of 
change, 
if 
it 
does 
but 
produce 
a 
new 
thought 
like 
the 
preceding. 


‘But 
suppose 
it 
to 
be 
not 
confined 
within 
such 
narrow 
bounds; 
it 
must 
be 
granted 
at 
least 
that 
its 
going 
from 
one 
thought 
to 
another 
implies 
some 
reason 
of 
affinity. 
If 
I 
suppose 
that 
in 
a 
certain 
moment 
the 
soul 
of 
Caesar 
sees 
a 
tree 
with 
leaves 
and 
blossoms, 
I 
can 
conceive 
that 
it 
does 
immediately 
desire 
to 
see 
one 
that 
has 
only 
leaves, 
and 
then 
one 
that 
has 
only 
blossoms, 
and 
that 
it 
will 
thus 
successively 
produce 
several 
images 
arising 
from 
one 
another; 
but 
one 
cannot 
conceive 
the 
odd 
change 
of 
thoughts, 
which 
have 
no 
affinitywith,but 
are 
even 
contrary 
to, 
one 
another, 
and 
which 
aresocommon 



in 
men’s 
souls. 
One 
cannot 
apprehend 
how 
God 
could 
place 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
Julius 
Caesar 
the 
principle 
of 
what 
I 
am 
going 
to 
say. 
He 
was 
without 
doubt 
pricked 
with 
a 
pin 
more 
than 
once, 
when 
he 
was 
sucking; 
and 
therefore 
according 
to 
M. 
Leibniz’ 
hypothesis 
which 
I 
am 
here 
considering, 
his 
soul 
must 
have 
produced 
in 
itself 
a 
sense 
of 
pain 
immediately 
after 
the 
pleasant 
sensations 
of 
the 
sweetness 
of 
the 
milk, 
which 
it 
had 
enjoyed 
for 
the 
space 
of 
two 
or 
three 
minutes. 
By 
what 
springs 
was 
it 
determined 
to 
interrupt 
its 
pleasures 
and 
to 
give 
itself 
all 
of 
a 
sudden 
a 
sense 
of 
pain, 
without 
receiving 
any 
intimation 
of 
preparing 
itself 
to 
change, 
and 
without 
any 
new 
alteration 
in 
its 
substance? 
If 
you 
run 
over 
the 
life 
of 
that 
Roman 
emperor, 
every 
page 
willaffordyoumatterforastrongerobjection 
thanthis 
is. 


‘VII. 
The 
thing 
would 
be 
less 
incomprehensible 
if 
it 
were 
supposed 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
is 
not 
one 
spirit 
but 
rather 
a 
multitude 
of 
spirits, 
each 
of 
which 
has 
its 
functions, 
that 
begin 
and 
end 
precisely 
as 
the 
changes 
made 
in 
a 
human 
body 
require. 
By 
virtue 
of 
this 
supposition 
it 
should 
be 
said 
that 
something 
analogous 
to 
a 
great 
number 
of 
wheels 
and 
springs, 
or 
of 
matters 
that 
ferment, 
disposed 
according 
to 
the 
changes 
of 
our 
machine, 
awakens 
or 
lulls 
asleep 
for 
a 
certain 
time 
the 
action 
of 
each 
of 
those 
spirits. 
But 
then 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
would 
be 
no 
longer 
a 
single 
substance 
but 
an 
ens 
per 
aggregationem, 
a 
collection 
and 
heap 
of 
substances 
just 
like 
all 
material 
beings. 
We 
are 
here 
in 
quest 
of 
a 
single 
being, 
which 
produces 
in 
itself 
sometimes 
joy, 
sometimes 
pain, 
etc. 
and 
not 
of 
many 
beings, 
one 
of 
which 
produceshope,anotherdespair,etc. 


‘In 
these 
observations 
I 
have 
merely 
cleared 
and 
unfolded 
those 
which 
M. 
Leibniz 
has 
done 
me 
the 
honour 
to 
examine: 
and 
now 
I 
shall 
make 
some 
reflexionsuponhisanswers. 


‘VIII. 
He 
says 
(ibid. 
) 
that 
the 
law 
of 
the 
change 
which 
happens 
in 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
animal 
transports 
him 
from 
pleasure 
to 
pain 
at 
the 
very 



moment 
that 
a 
solution 
of 
continuity 
is 
made 
in 
his 
body; 
because 
the 
law 
of 
the 
indivisible 
substance 
of 
that 
animal 
is 
to 
represent 
what 
is 
done 
in 
his 
body 
as 
we 
experience 
it, 
and 
even 
to 
represent 
in 
some 
manner, 
and 
with 
respect 
to 
that 
body, 
whatever 
is 
done 
in 
the 
world. 
These 
words 
are 
a 
very 
good 
explication 
of 
the 
grounds 
of 
this 
system; 
they 
are, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
unfolding 
and 
key 
of 
it; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
they 
are 
the 
very 
things 
at 
which 
the 
objections 
of 
those 
who 
take 
this 
system 
to 
be 
impossible 
are 
levelled. 
The 
law 
M. 
Leibniz 
speaks 
of 
supposes 
a 
decree 
of 
God, 
and 
shows 
wherein 
this 
system 
agrees 
with 
that 
of 
occasional 
causes. 
Those 
two 
systems 
agree 
in 
this 
point, 
that 
there 
are 
laws 
according 
to 
which 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
is 
to 
represent 
what 
is 
done 
in 
the 
body 
of 
man, 
as 
we 
experience 
it. 
But 
they 
disagree 
as 
to 
the 
manner 
of 
executing 
those 
laws. 
The 
Cartesians 
say 
that 
God 
executes 
them; 
M. 
Leibniz 
will 
have 
it, 
that 
the 
soul 
itself 
does 
it; 
which 
appears 
to 
me 
impossible, 
because 
the 
soul 
has 
not 
the 
necessary 
instruments 
for 
such 
an 
execution. 
Now 
however 
infinite 
the 
power 
and 
knowledge 
of 
God 
be, 
he 
cannot 
perform 
with 
a 
machine 
deprived 
of 
a 
certain 
piece, 
what 
requires 
the 
concourse 
of 
such 
a 
piece. 
He 
must 
supply 
that 
defect; 
but 
then 
the 
effect 
would 
be 
produced 
by 
him 
and 
not 
by 
the 
machine. 
I 
shall 
show 
that 
the 
soul 
has 
not 
the 
instruments 
requisite 
for 
the 
divine 
law 
we 
speak 
of, 
and 
inordertodo

‘Fancy 
to 
yourself 
an 
animal 
created 
by 
God 
and 
designed 
to 
sing 
continually. 
It 
will 
always 
sing, 
that 
is 
most 
certain; 
but 
if 
God 
designs 
him 
a 
certain 
tablature, 
he 
must 
necessarily 
either 
put 
it 
before 
his 
eyes 
or 
imprint 
it 
upon 
his 
memory 
or 
dispose 
his 
muscles 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
mechanism 
one 
certain 
note 
will 
always 
come 
after 
another, 
agreeably 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
tablature. 
Without 
this 
one 
cannot 
apprehend 
that 
theanimal 
can 
always 
follow 
the 
whole 
setofthe 
notes 
appointed 
him 
by 
God. 
Let 
us 
apply 
this 
to 
man’s 
soul. 
M. 
Leibniz 
will 
have 
it 
that 
it 
has 



received 
not 
only 
the 
power 
of 
producing 
thoughts 
continually, 
but 
also 
the 
faculty 
of 
following 
always 
a 
certain 
set 
of 
thoughts, 
which 
answers 
the 
continual 
changes 
that 
happen 
in 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
body. 
This 
set 
of 
thoughts 
is 
like 
the 
tablature 
prescribed 
to 
the 
singing 
animal 
above 
mentioned. 
Can 
the 
soul 
change 
its 
perceptions 
or 
modifications 
at 
every 
moment 
according 
to 
such 
a 
set 
of 
thoughts, 
without 
knowing 
the 
series 
of 
the 
notes, 
and 
actually 
thinking 
upon 
them? 
But 
experience 
teaches 
us 
that 
it 
knows 
nothing 
of 
it. 
Were 
it 
not 
at 
least 
necessary 
that 
in 
default 
of 
such 
a 
knowledge, 
there 
should 
be 
in 
the 
soul 
a 
set 
of 
particular 
instruments, 
each 
of 
which 
would 
be 
a 
necessary 
cause 
of 
such 
and 
such 
a 
thought? 
Must 
they 
not 
be 
so 
placed 
and 
disposed 
as 
to 
operate 
precisely 
one 
after 
another, 
according 
to 
the 
correspondence 
pre-established 
between 
the 
changes 
of 
the 
body 
and 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
soul? 
but 
it 
is 
most 
certain 
that 
an 
immaterial 
simple 
and 
indivisible 
substance 
cannot 
be 
made 
up 
of 
such 
an 
innumerable 
multitude 
of 
particularinstrumentsplacedonebefore 
another,according 
totheorderofthe 
tablature 
in 
question. 
It 
is 
not 
therefore 
possible 
that 
a 
human 
soul 
should 
executethatlaw. 


‘M. 
Leibniz 
supposes 
that 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
distinctly 
know 
its 
future 
perceptions, 
but 
that 
it 
perceives 
them 
confusedly, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
in 
each 
substance 
traces 
of 
whatever 
hath 
happened, 
or 
shall 
happen 
to 
it: 
but 
that 
an 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
perceptions 
hinders 
us 
from 
distinguishing 
them. 
The 
present 
state 
of 
each 
substance 
is 
a 
natural 
consequence 
of 
its 
preceding 
state. 
The 
soul, 
though 
never 
so 
simple, 
has 
always 
a 
sentiment 
composed 
of 
several 
perceptions 
at 
one 
time: 
which 
answers 
our 
end 
as 
well 
as 
though 
it 
were 
composed 
of 
pieces, 
like 
a 
machine. 
For 
each 
foregoing 
perception 
has 
an 
influence 
on 
those 
that 
follow 
agreeably 
to 
a 
law 
of 
order, 
which 
is 
in 
perceptions 
as 
well 
as 
in 
motions...The 
perceptions 
that 
are 
together 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
soul 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
including 
an 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
little 



and 
indistinguishable 
sentiments 
that 
are 
to 
be 
unfolded, 
we 
need 
not 
wonder 
at 
the 
infinite 
variety 
of 
what 
is 
to 
result 
from 
it 
in 
time. 
This 
is 
only 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
representative 
nature 
of 
the 
soul, 
which 
is, 
to 
express 
what 
happens 
and 
what 
will 
happen 
in 
its 
body, 
by 
the 
connexion 
and 
correspondence 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
world. 
I 
have 
but 
little 
to 
say 
in 
answer 
to 
this: 
I 
shall 
only 
observe 
that 
this 
supposition 
when 
sufficiently 
cleared 
is 
the 
right 
way 
of 
solving 
all 
the 
difficulties. 
M. 
Leibniz, 
through 
the 
penetration 
of 
his 
great 
genius, 
has 
very 
well 
conceived 
the 
extent 
and 
strength 
of 
this 
objection, 
and 
what 
remedy 
ought 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
main 
inconveniency. 
I 
do 
not 
doubt 
but 
that 
he 
will 
smooth 
the 
rough 
parts 
of 
his 
system, 
and 
teach 
us 
some 
excellent 
things 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
spirits. 
Nobody 
can 
travel 
more 
usefully 
or 
more 
safely 
than 
he 
in 
the 
intellectual 
world. 
I 
hope 
that 
his 
curious 
explanations 
will 
remove 
all 
the 
impossibilities 
which 
I 
have 
hitherto 
found 
in 
his 
system, 
and 
that 
he 
will 
solidly 
remove 
my 
difficulties, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
Father 
Lami. 
And 
these 
hopes 
made 
me 
say 
before, 
without 
designing 
to 
pass 
a 
compliment 
upon 
that 
learned 
man, 
that 
hissystemoughtto 
belookedupon 
asanimportantconquest. 


‘He 
will 
not 
be 
much 
embarrassed 
by 
this, 
viz. 
that 
whereas 
according 
to 
the 
supposition 
of 
the 
Cartesians 
there 
is 
but 
one 
general 
law 
for 
the 
union 
of 
spirits 
and 
bodies, 
he 
will 
have 
it 
that 
God 
gives 
a 
particular 
law 
to 
each 
spirit; 
from 
whence 
it 
seems 
to 
result 
that 
the 
primitive 
constitution 
of 
each 
spirit 
is 
specifically 
different 
from 
all 
others. 
Do 
not 
the 
Thomists 
say, 
that

Leibniz 
acknowledged 
Bayle’s 
note 
in 
a 
further 
reply, 
which 
is 
written 
as 
though 
for 
publication. 
It 
was 
communicated 
to 
Bayle, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
in 
fact 
published. 
It 
is 
dated 
1702. 
It 
may 
be 
found 
in 
the 
standard 
collections 
of 
Leibniz’ 
philosophicalworks.

The 
principal 
point 
developed 
by 
Leibniz 
is 
the 
richness 
of 
content 
which, 
according 
to 
him, 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
each 
‘simple 
substance’. 
Its 
simplicity 
is 
more 
like 
the 
infinitely 
rich 
simplicity 
of 
the 
divine 
Being, 
than 
like 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
atom 
of 
Epicurus, 
with 
which 
Bayle 
had 
chosen 
to 
compare 
it. 
It 
contains 
a 
condensation 
in 
confused 
idea 
of 
the 
whole 
universe: 
and 
its 
essenceisfrom 
thefirstdefinedbythepartitis 
toplayinthe 
totalharmony. 


As 
to 
the 
musical 
score 
(‘tablature 
of 
notes’) 
which 
the 
individual 
soul 
plays 
from, 
in 
order 
to 
perform 
its 
ordained 
part 
in 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
this 
‘score’ 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
confused 
or 
implicit 
ideas 
at 
any 
moment 
present, 
from 
which 
an 
omniscient 
observer 
could 
always 
deduce 
what 
is 
to 
happen 
next. 
To 
the 
objection 
‘But 
the 
created 
soul 
is 
not 
an 
omniscient 
observer, 
and 
if 
it 
cannot 
read 
the 
score, 
the 
score 
is 
useless 
to 
it’, 
Leibniz 
replies 
by 
affirming 
that 
much 
spontaneous 
action 
arises 
from 
subjective 
and 
yet 
unperceived 
reasons, 
as 
we 
are 
all 
perfectly 
aware, 
once 
we 
attend 
to 
the 
relevant 
facts. 
All 
he 
claims 
to 
be 
doing 
is 
to 
generalize 
this 
observation. 
All 
events 
whatsoever 
arise 
from 
the 
‘interpretation 
of 
the 
score’ 
by 
monads, 
but 
verylittleofthis 
‘interpretation’ 
isinthe 
leastconscious. 


Leibniz 
passes 
from 
the 
remarks 
about 
his 
own 
doctrine 
under 
the 
article 
‘Rorarius’ 
to 
other 
articles 
of 
Bayle’s 
dictionary, 
and 
touches 
the 
question 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
evil, 
and 
other 
matters 
which 
receive 
their 
fuller 
treatment 
in 
the 
Theodicy. 


In 
the 
same 
year 
Leibniz 
wrote 
a 
very 
friendly 
letter 
to 
Bayle 
himself, 
offering 
further 
explanations 
of 
disputed 
points. 
He 
concluded 
it 
with 
a 
paragraph 
of 
some 
personal 
interest, 
comparing 
himself 
the 
historian-
philosopher 
with 
Bayle 
the 
philosophic 
lexicographer, 
and 
revealing 
by 
the 
wayhis 
attitudetophilosophy, 
science 
andhistory: 


‘We 
have 
good 
reason 
to 
admire, 
Sir, 
the 
way 
in 
which 
your 
striking 
reflexions 
on 
the 
deepest 
questions 
of 
philosophy 
remain 
unhindered 
by 
your 



boundless 
researches 
into 
matters 
of 
fact. 
I 
too 
am 
not 
always 
able 
to 
excuse 
myselffromdiscussionsofthesort,andhaveevenbeenobligedtodescend 
to 
questionsof 
genealogy, 
whichwouldbestillmoretrifling,wereitnotthatthe 
interests 
of 
States

upon 
them. 
I 
have 
worked 
much 
on 
the 
history 
of 
Germany 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
bears 
upon 
these 
countries, 
a 
study 
which 
has 
furnished 
me 
with 
some 
observations 
belonging 
to 
general 
history. 
So 
I 
have 
learnt 
not 
to 
neglectthe 
knowledge 
ofsheer 
facts. 
But 
if 
the 
choice 
were 
open 
to 
me, 
I 
should 
prefer 
natural 
history 
to 
political, 
and 
the 
customs 
and 
lawsGod 
has 
establishedinnature,to 
whatisobserved 
amongmankind.’ 


Leibniz 
now 
conceived 
the 
idea 
of 
putting 
together 
all 
the 
passages 
in 
Bayle’s 
works 
which 
interested 
him, 
and 
writing 
a 
systematic 
answer 
to 
them. 
Before 
he 
had 
leisure 
to 
finish 
the 
task, 
Bayle 
died.

PREFACE 



IT 
HAS 
EVER 
been 
seen 
that 
men 
in 
general 
have 
resorted 
to 
outward 
forms 
for 
the 
expression 
of 
their 
religion: 
sound 
piety, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
light 
and 
virtue,has 
never 
been 
the 
portionofthemany. 
One 
shouldnotwonderat 
this, 
nothing 
is 
so 
much 
in 
accord 
with 
human 
weakness. 
We 
are 
impressed 
by 
what 
is 
outward, 
while 
the 
inner 
essence 
of 
things 
requires 
consideration 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
as 
few 
persons 
are 
fitted 
to 
give. 
As 
true 
piety 
consists 
in 
principlesand 
practice, 
theoutward 
forms 
of 
religion 
imitate 
these,and 
are 
of 
two 
kinds: 
the 
one 
kind 
consists 
in 
ceremonial 
practices, 
and 
the 
other 
in 
the 
formularies 
of 
belief. 
Ceremonies 
resemble 
virtuous 
actions, 
and 
formularies 
are 
like 
shadows 
of 
the 
truth 
and 
approach, 
more 
or 
less, 
the 
true 
light. 
All 
these 
outward 
forms 
would 
be 
commendable 
if 
those 
who 
invented 
them 
had 
rendered 
them 
appropriate 
to 
maintain 
and 
to 
express 
that 
which 
they 
imitate 


— 
if 
religious 
ceremonies, 
ecclesiastical 
discipline, 
the 
rules 
of 
communities, 
human 
laws 
were 
always 
like 
a 
hedge 
round 
the 
divine 
law, 
to 
withdraw 
us 
from 
any 
approach 
to 
vice, 
to 
inure 
us 
to 
the 
good 
and 
to 
make 
us 
familiar 
with 
virtue. 
That 
was 
the 
aim 
of 
Moses 
and 
of 
other 
good 
lawgivers, 
of 
the 
wise 
men 
who 
founded 
religious 
orders, 
and 
above 
all 
of 
Jesus 
Christ, 
divine 
founder 
of 
the 
purest 
and 
most 
enlightened 
religion. 
It 
is 
just 
the 
same 
with 
the 
formularies 
of 
belief: 
they 
would 
be 
valid 
provided 
there 
were 
nothing 
in 
them 
inconsistent 
with 
truth 
unto 
salvation, 
even 
though 
the 
full 
truth 
concerned 
were 
not 
there. 
But 
it 
happens 
only 
too 
often 
that 
religion 
is 
choked 
in 
ceremonial, 
and 
that 
the 
divine 
light 
is 
obscured 
by 
the 
opinions 
of 
men. 

The 
pagans, 
who 
inhabited 
the 
earth 
before 
Christianity 
was 
founded, 
had 
only 
one 
kind 
of 
outward 
form: 
they 
had 
ceremonies 
in 
their 
worship, 
but 
they 
had 
no 
articles 
of 
faith 
and 
had 
never 
dreamed 
of 
drawing 
up 
formularies 
for 
their 
dogmatic 
theology. 
They 
knew 
not 
whether 
their 
gods 
were 
real 
persons 
or 
symbols 
of 
the 
forces 
of 
Nature, 
as 
the 
sun, 
the 
planets, 
the 
elements. 
Their 
mysteries 
consisted 
not 
in 
difficult 
dogmas 
but 
in 
certain 
secret 
observances, 
whence 
the 
profane, 
namely 
those 
who 
were 
not 
initiated, 
were 
excluded. 
These 
observances 
were 
very 
often 
ridiculousand 
absurd, 
and 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
conceal 
them 
in 
order 
to 
guard 
them 
against 
contempt. 
The 
pagans 
had 
their 
superstitions: 
they 
boasted 
of 
miracles, 
everything 
with 
them 
was 
full 
of 
oracles, 
auguries, 
portents, 
divinations; 
the 
priests 
invented 
signs 
of 
the 
anger 
or 
of 
the 
goodness 
of 
the 
gods, 
whose 
interpreters 
they 
claimed 
to 
be. 
This 
tended 
to 
sway 
minds 
through 
fear 
and 
hope 
concerning 
human 
events; 
but 
the 
great 
future 
of 
another 
life 
was 
scarce 
envisaged; 
one 
didnottroubletoimparttomen 
truenotionsof 
Godandofthesoul. 


Of 
all 
ancient 
peoples, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
Hebrews 
alone 
had 
public 
dogmas 
for 
their 
religion. 
Abraham 
and 
Moses 
established 
the 
belief 
in 
one 
God, 
source 
of 
all 
good, 
author 
of 
all 
things. 
The 
Hebrews 
speak 
of 
him 
in 
a 
manner 
worthy 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Substance; 
and 
one 
wonders 
at 
seeing 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
one 
small 
region 
of 
the 
earth 
more 
enlightened 
than 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
human 
race. 
Peradventure 
the 
wise 
men 
of 
other 
nations 
have 
sometimes 
said 
the 
same, 
but 
they 
have 
not 
had 
the 
good 
fortune 
to 
find 
a 
sufficient 
following 
and 
to 
convert 
the 
dogma 
into 
law. 
Nevertheless 
Moses 
had 
not 
inserted 
in 
his 
laws 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
immortality 
of 
souls: 
it 
was 
consistent 
with 
his 
ideas, 
it 
was 
taught 
by 
oral 
tradition; 
but 
it 
was 
not 
proclaimed 
for 
popularacceptanceuntilJesus 
Christliftedtheveil, 
and, 
without 
havingforce 
in 
his 
hand, 
taught 
with 
all 
the 
force 
of 
a 
lawgiver 
that 
immortal 
souls 
pass 
into 
another 
life, 
wherein 
they 
shall 
receive 
the 
wages 
of 
their 
deeds. 
Moses 



had 
already 
expressed 
the 
beautiful 
conceptions 
of 
the 
greatness 
and 
the 
goodness 
of 
God, 
whereto 
many 
civilized 
peoples 
to-day 
assent; 
but 
Jesus 
Christ 
demonstrated 
fully 
the 
results 
of 
these 
ideas, 
proclaiming 
that 
divine 
goodness 
and 
justice 
are 
shown 
forth 
to 
perfection 
in 
God’s 
designs 
for 
the 
soulsof 
men. 


I 
refrain 
from 
considering 
here 
the 
other 
points 
of 
the 
Christian 
doctrine, 
and 
I 
will 
show 
only 
how 
Jesus 
Christ 
brought 
about 
the 
conversion 
of 
natural 
religion 
into 
law, 
and 
gained 
for 
it 
the 
authority 
of 
a 
public 
dogma. 
Healone 
did 
that 
whichso 
manyphilosophers 
had 
endeavouredin 
vain 
to 
do; 
and 
Christians 
having 
at 
last 
gained 
the 
upper 
hand 
in 
the 
Roman 
Empire, 
the 
master 
of 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
known 
earth, 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
wise 
men 
became 
that 
of 
the 
nations. 
Later 
also 
Mahomet 
showed 
no 
divergence 
from 
the 
great 
dogmas 
of 
natural 
theology: 
his 
followers 
spread 
them 
abroad 
even 
among 
the 
most 
remote 
races 
of 
Asia 
and 
of 
Africa, 
whither 
Christianity 
had 
not 
been 
carried; 
and 
they 
abolished 
in 
many 
countries 
heathen 
superstitions 
which 
were 
contrary 
to 
the 
true 
doctrine 
of 
the 
unity 
of 
God 
and 
the 
immortalityofsouls. 


It 
is 
clear 
that 
Jesus 
Christ, 
completing 
what 
Moses 
had 
begun, 
wished 
that 
the 
Divinity 
should 
be 
the 
object 
not 
only 
of 
our 
fear 
and 
veneration 
but 
also 
of 
our 
love 
and 
devotion. 
Thus 
he 
made 
men 
happy 
by 
anticipation, 
and 
gave 
them 
here 
on 
earth 
a 
foretaste 
of 
future 
felicity. 
For 
there 
is 
nothing 
so 
agreeable 
as 
loving 
that 
which 
is 
worthy 
of 
love. 
Love 
is 
that 
mental 
state 
which 
makes 
us 
take 
pleasure 
in 
the 
perfections 
of 
the 
object 
of 
our 
love, 
and 
there 
is 
nothing 
more 
perfect 
than 
God, 
nor 
any 
greater 
delight 
than 
in 
him. 
To 
love 
him 
it 
suffices 
to 
contemplate 
his 
perfections, 
a 
thing 
easy 
indeed, 
because 
we 
find 
the 
ideas 
of 
these 
within 
ourselves. 
The 
perfections 
of 
God 
are 
those 
of 
our 
souls, 
but 
he 
possesses 
them 
in 
boundless 
measure; 
he 
is 
an 
Ocean, 
whereof 
to 
us 
only 
drops 
have 
been 
granted; 
there 
is 
in 
us 
some 



power, 
some 
knowledge, 
some 
goodness, 
but 
in 
God 
they 
are 
all 
in 
their 
entirety. 
Order, 
proportions, 
harmony 
delight 
us; 
painting 
and 
music 
are 
samples 
of 
these: 
God 
is 
all 
order; 
he 
always 
keeps 
truth 
of 
proportions, 
he 
makesuniversalharmony;allbeautyisaneffusionofhisrays. 


It 
follows 
manifestly 
that 
true 
piety 
and 
even 
true 
felicity 
consist 
in 
the 
love 
of 
God, 
but 
a 
love 
so 
enlightened 
that 
its 
fervour 
is 
attended 
by 
insight. 
This 
kind 
of 
love 
begets 
that 
pleasure 
in 
good 
actions 
which 
gives 
relief 
to 
virtue, 
and, 
relating 
all 
to 
God 
as 
to 
the 
centre, 
transports 
the 
human 
to 
the 
divine. 
For 
in 
doing 
one’s 
duty, 
in 
obeying 
reason, 
one 
carries 
out 
the 
orders 
of 
Supreme 
Reason. 
One 
directs 
all 
one’s 
intentions 
to 
the 
common 
good, 
which 
is 
no 
other 
than 
the 
glory 
of 
God. 
Thus 
one 
finds 
that 
there 
is 
no 
greater 
individual 
interest 
than 
to 
espouse 
that 
of 
the 
community, 
and 
one 
gains 
satisfaction 
for 
oneself 
by 
taking 
pleasure 
in 
the 
acquisition 
of 
true 
benefits 
for 
men. 
Whether 
one 
succeeds 
therein 
or 
not, 
one 
is 
content 
with 
what 
comes 
to 
pass, 
being 
once 
resigned 
to 
the 
will 
of 
God 
and 
knowing 
that 
what 
he 
wills 
is 
best. 
But 
before 
he 
declares 
his 
will 
by 
the 
event 
one 
endeavours 
to 
find 
it 
out 
by 
doing 
that 
which 
appears 
most 
in 
accord 
with 
his 
commands. 
When 
we 
are 
in 
this 
state 
of 
mind, 
we 
are 
not 
disheartened 
by 
ill 
success, 
we 
regret 
only 
our 
faults; 
and 
the 
ungrateful 
ways 
of 
men 
cause 
no 
relaxation 
in 
the 
exercise 
of 
our 
kindly 
disposition. 
Our 
charity 
is 
humble 
and 
full 
of 
moderation, 
it 
presumes 
not 
to 
domineer; 
attentive 
alike 
to 
our 
own 
faults 
and 
to 
the 
talents 
of 
others, 
we 
are 
inclined 
to 
criticize 
our 
own 
actions 
and 
to 
excuse 
and 
vindicate 
those 
of 
others. 
We 
must 
work 
out 
our 
own 
perfection 
and 
do 
wrong 
to 
no 
man. 
There 
is 
no 
piety 
where 
there 
is 
not 
charity; 
and 
without 
being 
kindly 
and 
beneficent 
one 
cannot 
show 
sincere 
religion. 


Good 
disposition, 
favourable 
upbringing, 
association 
with 
pious 
and 
virtuous 
persons 
may 
contribute 
much 
towards 
such 
a 
propitious 
condition 



for 
our 
souls; 
but 
most 
securely 
are 
they 
grounded 
therein 
by 
good 
principles. 
I 
have 
already 
said 
that 
insight 
must 
be 
joined 
to 
fervour, 
that 
the 
perfecting 
of 
our 
understanding 
must 
accomplish 
the 
perfecting 
of 
our 
will. 
The 
practices 
of 
virtue, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
vice, 
may 
be 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
mere 
habit, 
one 
may 
acquire 
a 
taste 
for 
them; 
but 
when 
virtue 
is 
reasonable, 
when 
it 
is 
related 
to 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
supreme 
reason 
of 
things, 
it 
is 
founded 
on 
knowledge. 
One 
cannot 
love 
God 
without 
knowing 
his 
perfections, 
and 
this 
knowledge 
contains 
the 
principles 
of 
true 
piety. 
The 
purpose 
of 
religion 
should 
be 
to 
imprint 
these 
principles 
upon 
our 
souls: 
but 
in 
some 
strange 
way 
it 
has 
happened 
all 
too 
often 
that 
men, 
that 
teachers 
of 
religion 
have 
strayed 
far 
from 
this 
purpose. 
Contrary 
to 
the 
intention 
of 
our 
divine 
Master, 
devotion 
has 
been 
reduced 
to 
ceremonies 
and 
doctrine 
has 
been 
cumbered 
with 
formulae. 
All 
too 
often 
these 
ceremonies 
have 
not 
been 
well 
fitted 
to 
maintain 
the 
exercise 
of 
virtue, 
and 
the 
formulae 
sometimes 
have 
not 
been 
lucid. 
Can 
one 
believe 
it? 
Some 
Christians 
have 
imagined 
that 
they 
could 
be 
devout 
without 
loving 
their 
neighbour, 
and 
pious 
without 
loving 
God; 
or 
else 
people 
have 
thought 
that 
they 
could 
love 
their 
neighbour 
without 
serving 
him 
and 
could 
love 
God 
without 
knowing 
him. 
Many 
centuries 
have 
passed 
without 
recognition 
of 
this 
defect 
by 
the 
people 
at 
large; 
and 
there 
are 
still 
great 
traces 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
darkness. 
There 
are 
divers 
persons 
who 
speak 
muchof 
piety, 
of 
devotion, 
of 
religion,whoare 
evenbusiedwith 
the 
teaching 
of 
such 
things, 
and 
who 
yet 
prove 
to 
be 
by 
no 
means 
versed 
in 
the 
divine 
perfections. 
They 
ill 
understand 
the 
goodness 
and 
the 
justice 
of 
the 
Sovereign 
of 
the 
universe; 
they 
imagine 
a 
God 
who 
deserves 
neither 
to 
be 
imitated 
nor 
to 
be 
loved. 
This 
indeed 
seemed 
to 
me 
dangerous 
in 
its 
effect, 
since 
it 
is 
of 
serious 
moment 
that 
the 
very 
source 
of 
piety 
should 
be 
preserved 
from 
infection. 
The 
old 
errors 
of 
those 
who 
arraigned 
the 
Divinity 
or 
who 
made 
thereof 
an 
evil 
principle 
have 
been 
renewed 
sometimes 
in 
our 
own 
days: 



people 
have 
pleaded 
the 
irresistible 
power 
of 
God 
when 
it 
was 
a 
question 
rather 
of 
presenting 
his 
supreme 
goodness; 
and 
they 
have 
assumed 
a 
despotic 
power 
when 
they 
should 
rather 
have 
conceived 
of 
a 
power 
ordered 
by 
the 
most 
perfect 
wisdom. 
I 
have 
observed 
that 
these 
opinions, 
apt 
to 
do 
harm, 
rested 
especially 
on 
confused 
notions 
which 
had 
been 
formed 
concerning 
freedom, 
necessity 
and 
destiny; 
and 
I 
have 
taken 
up 
my 
pen 
more 
than 
once 
on 
such 
an 
occasion 
to 
give 
explanations 
on 
these 
important 
matters. 
But 
finally 
I 
have 
been 
compelled 
to 
gather 
up 
my 
thoughts 
on 
all 
these 
connected 
questions, 
and 
to 
impart 
them 
to 
the 
public. 
It 
is 
this 
that 
I 
have 
undertaken 
in 
the 
Essays 
which 
I 
offer 
here, 
on 
the 
Goodness 
of 
God, 
the 
FreedomofMan,andtheOriginof 
Evil. 


There 
are 
two 
famous 
labyrinths 
where 
our 
reason 
very 
often 
goes 
astray: 
one 
concerns 
the 
great 
question 
of 
the 
Free 
and 
the 
Necessary, 
above 
all 
in 
the 
production 
and 
the 
origin 
of 
Evil; 
the 
other 
consists 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
continuity 
and 
of 
the 
indivisibles 
which 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
elements 
thereof, 
and 
where 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
infinite 
must 
enter 
in. 
The 
first 
perplexes 
almost 
all 
the 
human 
race, 
the 
other 
exercises 
philosophers 
only. 
I 
shall 
have 
perchance 
at 
another 
time 
an 
opportunity 
to 
declare 
myself 
on 
the 
second, 
and 
to 
point 
out 
that, 
for 
lack 
of 
a 
true 
conception 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
substance 
and 
matter, 
people 
have 
taken 
up 
false 
positions 
leading 
to 
insurmountable 
difficulties, 
difficulties 
which 
should 
properly 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
overthrow 
of 
these 
very 
positions. 
But 
if 
the 
knowledge 
of 
continuity 
is 
important 
for 
speculative 
enquiry, 
that 
of 
necessity 
is 
none 
the 
less 
so 
for 
practical 
application; 
and 
it, 
together 
with 
the 
questions 
therewith 
connected, 
to 
wit, 
thefreedomofmanandthejusticeofGod,formstheobjectof 
thistreatise. 


Men 
have 
been 
perplexed 
in 
well-nigh 
every 
age 
by 
a 
sophism 
which 
the 
ancients 
called 
the 
‘Lazy 
Reason’, 
because 
it 
tended 
towards 
doing 
nothing, 
or 
at 
least 
towards 
being 
careful 
for 
nothing 
and 
only 
following 
inclination 



for 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
moment. 
For, 
they 
said, 
if 
the 
future 
is 
necessary, 
that 
which 
must 
happen 
will 
happen, 
whatever 
I 
may 
do. 
Now 
the 
future 
(so 
they 
said) 
is 
necessary, 
whether 
because 
the 
Divinity 
foresees 
everything, 
and 
even 
pre-establishes 
it 
by 
the 
control 
of 
all 
things 
in 
the 
universe; 
or 
because 
everything 
happens 
of 
necessity, 
through 
the 
concatenation 
of 
causes; 
or 
finally, 
through 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
truth, 
which 
is 
determinate 
in 
the 
assertionsthat 
canbemadeon 
futureevents,asitisinallassertions,sincethe 
assertion 
must 
always 
be 
true 
or 
false 
in 
itself, 
even 
though 
we 
know 
not 
always 
which 
it 
is. 
And 
all 
these 
reasons 
for 
determination 
which 
appear 
different 
converge 
finally 
like 
lines 
upon 
one 
and 
the 
same 
centre; 
for 
there 
is 
a 
truth 
in 
the 
future 
eventwhichispredetermined 
bythe 
causes, 
and 
God 
preestablishes 
itin 
establishing 
the 
causes. 


The 
false 
conception 
of 
necessity, 
being 
applied 
in 
practice, 
has 
given 
rise 
to 
what 
I 
call 
Fatum 
Mahometanum, 
fate 
after 
the 
Turkish 
fashion, 
because 
it 
is 
said 
of 
the 
Turks 
that 
they 
do 
not 
shun 
danger 
or 
even 
abandon 
places 
infected 
with 
plague, 
owing 
to 
their 
use 
of 
such 
reasoning 
as 
that 
just 
recorded. 
For 
what 
is 
called 
Fatum 
Stoicum 
was 
not 
so 
black 
as 
it 
is 
painted: 
it 
did 
not 
divert 
men 
from 
the 
care 
of 
their 
affairs, 
but 
it 
tended 
to 
give 
them 
tranquillity 
in 
regard 
to 
events, 
through 
the 
consideration 
of 
necessity, 
which 
renders 
our 
anxieties 
and 
our 
vexations 
needless. 
In 
which 
respect 
these 
philosophers 
were 
not 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
teaching 
of 
our 
Lord, 
who 
deprecates 
these 
anxieties 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
morrow, 
comparing 
them 
with 
the 
needless 
trouble 
a 
man 
would 
give 
himself 
in 
labouring 
to 
increase 
his 
stature. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
Stoics 
(and 
perhaps 
also 
of 
some 
famous 
philosophers 
of 
our 
time), 
confining 
themselves 
to 
this 
alleged 
necessity, 
can 
only 
impart 
a 
forced 
patience; 
whereas 
our 
Lord 
inspires 
thoughts 
more 
sublime, 
and 
even 
instructs 
us 
in 
the 
means 
of 
gaining 
contentment 
by 



assuring 
us 
that 
since 
God, 
being 
altogether 
good 
and 
wise, 
has 
care 
for 
everything, 
even 
so 
far 
as 
not 
to 
neglect 
one 
hair 
of 
our 
head, 
our 
confidence 
in 
him 
ought 
to 
be 
entire. 
And 
thus 
we 
should 
see, 
if 
we 
were 
capable 
of 
understanding 
him, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
even 
possible 
to 
wish 
for 
anything 
better 
(as 
much 
in 
general 
as 
for 
ourselves) 
than 
what 
he 
does. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
one 
said 
to 
men: 
Do 
your 
duty 
and 
be 
content 
with 
that 
which 
shall 
come 
of 
it, 
not 
only 
because 
you 
cannot 
resist 
divine 
providence, 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
(which 
may 
suffice 
for 
tranquillity, 
but 
not 
for 
contentment), 
but 
also 
because 
you 
have 
to 
do 
with 
a 
good 
master. 
And 
that 
is 
what 
may 
be 
called 
Fatum 
Christianum. 


Nevertheless 
it 
happens 
that 
most 
men, 
and 
even 
Christians, 
introduce 
into 
their 
dealings 
some 
mixture 
of 
fate 
after 
the 
Turkish 
fashion, 
although 
they 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
acknowledge 
it. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
they 
are 
not 
inactive 
or 
negligent 
when 
obvious 
perils 
or 
great 
and 
manifest 
hopes 
present 
themselves; 
for 
they 
will 
not 
fail 
to 
abandon 
a 
house 
that 
is 
about 
to 
fall 
and 
to 
turn 
aside 
from 
a 
precipice 
they 
see 
in 
their 
path; 
and 
they 
will 
burrow 
in 
theearth 
to 
dig 
up 
a 
treasure 
half 
uncovered,without 
waiting 
forfatetofinish 
dislodging 
it. 
But 
when 
the 
good 
or 
the 
evil 
is 
remote 
and 
uncertain 
and 
the 
remedy 
painful 
or 
little 
to 
our 
taste, 
the 
lazy 
reason 
seems 
to 
us 
to 
be 
valid. 
For 
example, 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
preserving 
one’s 
health 
and 
even 
one’s 
life 
by 
good 
diet, 
people 
to 
whom 
one 
gives 
advice 
thereupon 
very 
often 
answer 
that 
our 
days 
are 
numbered 
and 
that 
it 
avails 
nothing 
to 
try 
to 
struggle 
against 
that 
which 
God 
destines 
for 
us. 
But 
these 
same 
persons 
run 
to 
even 
the 
most 
absurd 
remedies 
when 
the 
evil 
they 
had 
neglected 
draws 
near. 
One 
reasons 
in 
somewhat 
the 
same 
way 
when 
the 
question 
for 
consideration 
is 
somewhat 
thorny, 
as 
for 
instance 
when 
one 
asks 
oneself, 
quod 
vitae 
sectabor 
iter? 
what 
profession 
one 
must 
choose; 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
a 
marriage 
being 
arranged, 
of 
a 
war 
being 
undertaken, 
of 
a 
battle 
being 
fought; 
for 
in 



these 
cases 
many 
will 
be 
inclined 
to 
evade 
the 
difficulty 
of 
consideration 
and 
abandon 
themselves 
to 
fate 
or 
to 
inclination, 
as 
if 
reason 
should 
not 
be 
employed 
except 
in 
easy 
cases. 
One 
will 
then 
all 
too 
often 
reason 
in 
the 
Turkish 
fashion 
(although 
this 
way 
is 
wrongly 
termed 
trusting 
in 
providence, 
a 
thing 
that 
in 
reality 
occurs 
only 
when 
one 
has 
done 
one’s 
duty) 
and 
one 
will 
employ 
the 
lazy 
reason, 
derived 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
inevitable 
fate, 
to 
relieve 
oneself 
of 
the 
need 
to 
reason 
properly. 
One 
will 
thus 
overlook 
the 
fact 
that 
if 
this 
argument 
contrary 
to 
the 
practice 
of 
reason 
were 
valid, 
it 
would 
always 
hold 
good, 
whether 
the 
consideration 
were 
easy 
or 
not. 
This 
laziness 
is 
to 
some 
extent 
the 
source 
of 
the 
superstitious 
practices 
of 
fortune-tellers, 
which 
meet 
with 
just 
such 
credulity 
as 
men 
show 
towards 
the 
philosopher’s 
stone, 
because 
they 
would 
fain 
have 
short 
cuts 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
happiness 
withouttrouble. 


I 
do 
not 
speak 
here 
of 
those 
who 
throw 
themselves 
upon 
fortune 
because 
they 
have 
been 
happy 
before, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
something 
permanent 
therein. 
Their 
argument 
from 
the 
past 
to 
the 
future 
has 
just 
as 
slight 
a 
foundation 
as 
theprinciplesofastrologyandof 
other 
kinds 
ofdivination. 
Theyoverlook 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
usually 
an 
ebb 
and 
flow 
in 
fortune, 
una 
marea, 
as 
Italians 
playing 
basset 
are 
wont 
to 
call 
it. 
With 
regard 
to 
this 
they 
make 
their 
own 
particularobservations,which 
Iwould,nevertheless,counselnone 
totrusttoo 
much. 
Yet 
this 
confidence 
that 
people 
have 
in 
their 
fortune 
serves 
often 
to 
give 
courage 
to 
men, 
and 
above 
all 
to 
soldiers, 
and 
causes 
them 
to 
have 
indeed 
that 
good 
fortune 
they 
ascribe 
to 
themselves. 
Even 
so 
do 
predictions 
often 
cause 
that 
to 
happen 
which 
has 
been 
foretold, 
as 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
the 
opinion 
the 
Mahometans 
hold 
on 
fate 
makes 
them 
resolute. 
Thus 
even 
errors 
have 
their 
use 
at 
times, 
but 
generally 
as 
providing 
a 
remedy 
for 
other 
errors: 
and 
truthisunquestionablybetter. 



But 
it 
is 
taking 
an 
unfair 
advantage 
of 
this 
alleged 
necessity 
of 
fate 
to 
employ 
it 
in 
excuse 
for 
our 
vices 
and 
our 
libertinism. 
I 
have 
often 
heard 
it 
said 
by 
smart 
young 
persons, 
who 
wished 
to 
play 
the 
freethinker, 
that 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
preach 
virtue, 
to 
censure 
vice, 
to 
create 
hopes 
of 
reward 
and 
fears 
of 
punishment, 
since 
it 
may 
be 
said 
of 
the 
book 
of 
destiny, 
that 
what 
is 
written 
is 
written, 
and 
that 
our 
behaviour 
can 
change 
nothing 
therein. 
Thus, 
they 
would 
say, 
it 
were 
best 
to 
follow 
one’s 
inclination, 
dwelling 
only 
upon 
such 
things 
as 
may 
content 
us 
in 
the 
present. 
They 
did 
not 
reflect 
upon 
the 
strange 
consequences 
of 
this 
argument, 
which 
would 
prove 
too 
much, 
since 
it 
would 
prove 
(for 
instance) 
that 
one 
should 
take 
a 
pleasant 
beverage 
even 
though 
one 
knows 
it 
is 
poisoned. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
(if 
it 
were 
valid) 
I 
could 
say: 
if 
it 
is 
written 
in 
the 
records 
of 
the 
Parcae 
that 
poison 
will 
kill 
me 
now 
or 
will 
do 
me 
harm, 
this 
will 
happen 
even 
though 
I 
were 
not 
to 
take 
this 
beverage; 
and 
if 
this 
is 
not 
written, 
it 
will 
not 
happen 
even 
though 
I 
should 
takethissamebeverage;consequentlyIshallbe 
abletofollowwithimpunity 
my 
inclination 
to 
take 
what 
is 
pleasing, 
however 
injurious 
it 
may 
be; 
the 
resultofwhichreasoningisan 
obvious 
absurdity. 
This 
objection 
disconcerted 
them 
a 
little, 
but 
they 
always 
reverted 
to 
their 
argument, 
phrased 
in 
different 
ways, 
until 
they 
were 
brought 
to 
understand 
where 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
sophism 
lies. 
It 
is 
untrue 
that 
the 
event 
happens 
whatever 
one 
may 
do: 
it 
will 
happen 
because 
one 
does 
what 
leads 
thereto; 
and 
if 
the 
event 
is 
written 
beforehand, 
the 
cause 
that 
will 
make 
it 
happen 
is 
written 
also. 
Thus 
the 
connexion 
of 
effects 
and 
causes, 
so 
far 
from 
establishing 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
necessity 
detrimentalto 
conduct, 
servesto 
overthrowit. 


Yet, 
without 
having 
evil 
intentions 
inclined 
towards 
libertinism, 
one 
may 
envisage 
differently 
the 
strange 
consequences 
of 
an 
inevitable 
necessity, 
considering 
that 
it 
would 
destroy 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
will, 
so 
essential 
to 
the 
moralityofaction:forjusticeandinjustice,praiseandblame,punishmentand 



reward 
cannot 
attach 
to 
necessary 
actions, 
and 
nobody 
will 
be 
under 
obligation 
to 
do 
the 
impossible 
or 
to 
abstain 
from 
doing 
what 
is 
absolutely 
necessary. 
Without 
any 
intention 
of 
abusing 
this 
consideration 
in 
order 
to 
favour 
irregularity, 
one 
will 
nevertheless 
not 
escape 
embarrassment 
sometimes, 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
a 
question 
of 
judging 
the 
actions 
of 
others, 
or 
rather 
of 
answering 
objections, 
amongst 
which 
there 
are 
some 
even 
concerned 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
God, 
whereof 
I 
will 
speak 
presently. 
And 
as 
an 
insuperable 
necessity 
would 
open 
the 
door 
to 
impiety, 
whether 
through 
the 
impunity 
one 
could 
thence 
infer 
or 
the 
hopelessness 
of 
any 
attempt 
to 
resist 
a 
torrent 
that 
sweeps 
everything 
along 
with 
it, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
the 
different 
degrees 
of 
necessity, 
and 
to 
show 
that 
there 
are 
some 
which 
cannot 
do 
harm, 
as 
there 
are 
others 
which 
cannot 
be 
admitted 
without 
giving 
rise 
to 
evil 
consequences. 


Some 
go 
even 
further: 
not 
content 
with 
using 
the 
pretext 
of 
necessity 
to 
prove 
that 
virtue 
and 
vice 
do 
neither 
good 
nor 
ill, 
they 
have 
the 
hardihood 
to 
make 
the 
Divinity 
accessary 
to 
their 
licentious 
way 
of 
life, 
and 
they 
imitate 
the 
pagans 
of 
old, 
who 
ascribed 
to 
the 
gods 
the 
cause 
of 
their 
crimes, 
as 
if 
a 
divinity 
drove 
them 
to 
do 
evil. 
The 
philosophy 
of 
Christians, 
which 
recognizes 
better 
than 
that 
of 
the 
ancients 
the 
dependence 
of 
things 
upon 
the 
first 
Author 
and 
his 
co-operation 
with 
all 
the 
actions 
of 
creatures, 
appears 
to 
have 
increased 
this 
difficulty. 
Some 
able 
men 
in 
our 
own 
time 
have 
gone 
so 
far 
as 
to 
deny 
all 
action 
to 
creatures, 
and 
M. 
Bayle, 
who 
tended 
a 
little 
towardsthis 
extraordinaryopinion,madeuseofittorestorethelapseddogma 
of 
the 
two 
principles, 
or 
two 
gods, 
the 
one 
good, 
the 
other 
evil, 
as 
if 
this 
dogma 
were 
a 
better 
solution 
to 
the 
difficulties 
over 
the 
origin 
of 
evil. 
Yet 
again 
he 
acknowledges 
that 
it 
is 
an 
indefensible 
opinion 
and 
that 
the 
oneness 
of 
the 
Principle 
is 
incontestably 
founded 
on 
a 
priori 
reasons; 
but 
he 
wishes 
to 
infer 
that 
our 
Reason 
is 
confounded 
and 
cannot 
meet 
her 
own 
objections, 
and 



that 
one 
should 
disregard 
them 
and 
hold 
fast 
the 
revealed 
dogmas, 
which 
teach 
us 
the 
existence 
of 
one 
God 
altogether 
good, 
altogether 
powerful 
and 
altogether 
wise. 
But 
many 
readers, 
convinced 
of 
the 
irrefutable 
nature 
of 
his 
objections 
and 
believing 
them 
to 
be 
at 
least 
as 
strong 
as 
the 
proofs 
for 
the 
truthof 
religion, 
woulddrawdangerousconclusions. 


Even 
though 
there 
were 
no 
co-operation 
by 
God 
in 
evil 
actions, 
one 
could 
not 
help 
finding 
difficulty 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
foresees 
them 
and 
that, 
being 
able 
to 
prevent 
them 
through 
his 
omnipotence, 
he 
yet 
permits 
them. 
This 
is 
why 
some 
philosophers 
and 
even 
some 
theologians 
have 
rather 
chosen 
to 
deny 
to 
God 
any 
knowledge 
of 
the 
detail 
of 
things 
and, 
above 
all, 
of 
future 
events, 
than 
to 
admit 
what 
they 
believed 
repellent 
to 
his 
goodness. 
The 
Socinians 
and 
Conrad 
Vorstius 
lean 
towards 
that 
side; 
and 
Thomas 
Bonartes, 
an 
English 
Jesuit 
disguised 
under 
a 
pseudonym 
but 
exceedingly 
learned, 
who 
wrote 
a 
book 
De 
Concordia 
Scientiae 
cum 
Fide, 
of 
which 
I 
will 
speak 
later, 
appearstohintatthisalso. 


They 
are 
doubtless 
much 
mistaken; 
but 
others 
are 
not 
less 
so 
who, 
convinced 
that 
nothing 
comes 
to 
pass 
save 
by 
the 
will 
and 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
ascribe 
to 
him 
intentions 
and 
actions 
so 
unworthy 
of 
the 
greatest 
and 
the 
best 
of 
all 
beings 
that 
one 
would 
say 
these 
authors 
have 
indeed 
renounced 
the 
dogma 
which 
recognizes 
God’s 
justice 
and 
goodness. 
They 
thought 
that, 
being 
supreme 
Master 
of 
the 
universe, 
he 
could 
without 
any 
detriment 
to 
his 
holiness 
cause 
sins 
to 
be 
committed, 
simply 
at 
his 
will 
and 
pleasure, 
or 
in 
order 
that 
he 
might 
have 
the 
pleasure 
of 
punishing; 
and 
even 
that 
he 
could 
take 
pleasure 
in 
eternally 
afflicting 
innocent 
people 
without 
doing 
any 
injustice, 
because 
no 
one 
has 
the 
right 
or 
the 
power 
to 
control 
his 
actions. 
Some 
even 
have 
gone 
so 
far 
as 
to 
say 
that 
God 
acts 
thus 
indeed; 
and 
on 
the 
plea 
that 
we 
are 
as 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
with 
him, 
they 
liken 
us 
to 



earthworms 
which 
men 
crush 
without 
heeding 
as 
they 
walk, 
or 
in 
general 
to 
animalsthatarenotofourspeciesandwhich 
we 
donotscrupletoill-treat. 


I 
believe 
that 
many 
persons 
otherwise 
of 
good 
intentions 
are 
misled 
by 
these 
ideas, 
because 
they 
have 
not 
sufficient 
knowledge 
of 
their 
consequences. 
They 
do 
not 
see 
that, 
properly 
speaking, 
God’s 
justice 
is 
thus 
overthrown. 
For 
what 
idea 
shall 
we 
form 
of 
such 
a 
justice 
as 
has 
only 
will 
for 
its 
rule, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
where 
the 
will 
is 
not 
guided 
by 
the 
rules 
of 
good 
and 
even 
tends 
directly 
towards 
evil? 
Unless 
it 
be 
the 
idea 
contained 
in 
that 
tyrannical 
definition 
by 
Thrasymachus 
in 
Plato, 
which 
designated 
as 
just 
that 
which 
pleases 
the 
stronger. 
Such 
indeed 
is 
the 
position 
taken 
up, 
albeit 
unwittingly, 
by 
those 
who 
rest 
all 
obligation 
upon 
constraint, 
and 
in 
consequence 
take 
power 
as 
the 
gauge 
of 
right. 
But 
one 
will 
soon 
abandon 
maxims 
so 
strange 
and 
so 
unfit 
to 
make 
men 
good 
and 
charitable 
through 
the 
imitation 
of 
God. 
For 
one 
will 
reflect 
that 
a 
God 
who 
would 
take 
pleasure 
in 
the 
misfortune 
of 
others 
cannot 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
evil 
principle 
of 
the 
Manichaeans, 
assuming 
that 
this 
principle 
had 
become 
sole 
master 
of 
the 
universe; 
and 
that 
in 
consequence 
one 
must 
attribute 
to 
the 
true 
God 
sentiments 
thatrender 
himworthytobecalled 
thegood 
Principle. 


Happily 
these 
extravagant 
dogmas 
scarce 
obtain 
any 
longer 
among 
theologians. 
Nevertheless 
some 
astute 
persons, 
who 
are 
pleased 
to 
make 
difficulties, 
revive 
them: 
they 
seek 
to 
increase 
our 
perplexity 
by 
uniting 
the 
controversies 
aroused 
by 
Christian 
theology 
to 
the 
disputes 
of 
philosophy. 
Philosophers 
have 
considered 
the 
questions 
of 
necessity, 
of 
freedom 
and 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
evil; 
theologians 
have 
added 
thereto 
those 
of 
original 
sin, 
of 
grace 
and 
of 
predestination. 
The 
original 
corruption 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
comingfrom 
thefirstsin, 
appearsto 
us 
to 
haveimposed 
a 
naturalnecessity 
to 
sin 
without 
the 
succour 
of 
divine 
grace: 
but 
necessity 
being 
incompatible 



with 
punishment, 
it 
will 
be 
inferred 
that 
a 
sufficient 
grace 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
giventoallmen;whichdoesnotseemto 
beinconformitywithexperience. 


But 
the 
difficulty 
is 
great, 
above 
all, 
in 
relation 
to 
God’s 
dispositions 
for 
the 
salvation 
of 
men. 
There 
are 
few 
saved 
or 
chosen; 
therefore 
the 
choice 
of 
many 
is 
not 
God’s 
decreed 
will. 
And 
since 
it 
is 
admitted 
that 
those 
whom 
he 
has 
chosen 
deserve 
it 
no 
more 
than 
the 
rest, 
and 
are 
not 
even 
fundamentally 
less 
evil, 
the 
goodness 
which 
they 
have 
coming 
only 
from 
the 
gift 
of 
God, 
the 
difficulty 
is 
increased. 
Where 
is, 
then, 
his 
justice 
(people 
will 
say), 
or 
at 
the 
least, 
where 
is 
his 
goodness? 
Partiality, 
or 
respect 
of 
persons, 
goes 
against 
justice, 
and 
he 
who 
without 
cause 
sets 
bounds 
to 
his 
goodness 
cannot 
have 
it 
in 
sufficient 
measure. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
those 
who 
are 
not 
chosen 
are 
lost 
by 
their 
own 
fault: 
they 
lack 
good 
will 
or 
living 
faith; 
but 
it 
rested 
with 
God 
alone 
to 
grant 
it 
them. 
We 
know 
that 
besides 
inward 
grace 
there 
are 
usually 
outward 
circumstances 
which 
distinguish 
men, 
and 
that 
training, 
conversation, 
example 
often 
correct 
or 
corrupt 
natural 
disposition. 
Now 
that 
God 
should 
call 
forth 
circumstances 
favourable 
to 
some 
and 
abandon 
others 
to 
experiences 
which 
contribute 
to 
their 
misfortune, 
will 
not 
that 
give 
us 
cause 
for 
astonishment? 
And 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
(so 
it 
seems) 
to 
say 
with 
some 
that 
inward 
grace 
is 
universal 
and 
equal 
for 
all. 
For 
these 
same 
authors 
are 
obliged 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
exclamations 
of 
St. 
Paul, 
and 
to 
say: 
‘O 
the 
depth!’ 
when 
they 
consider 
how 
men 
are 
distinguished 
by 
what 
we 
may 
call 
outward 
graces, 
that 
is, 
by 
graces 
appearing 
in 
the 
diversity 
of 
circumstances 
which 
God 
calls 
forth, 
whereof 
men 
are 
not 
the 
masters, 
and 
which 
have 
neverthelesssogreataninfluenceupon 
allthatconcerns 
theirsalvation. 


Nor 
will 
it 
help 
us 
to 
say 
with 
St. 
Augustine 
that, 
all 
men 
being 
involved 
in 
the 
damnation 
caused 
by 
the 
sin 
of 
Adam, 
God 
might 
have 
left 
them 
all 
in 
their 
misery; 
and 
that 
thus 
his 
goodness 
alone 
induces 
him 
to 
deliver 
some 
of 
them. 
For 
not 
only 
is 
it 
strange 
that 
the 
sin 
of 
another 
should 
condemn 



anyone, 
but 
there 
still 
remains 
the 
question 
why 
God 
does 
not 
deliver 
all 
— 
why 
he 
delivers 
the 
lesser 
number 
and 
why 
some 
in 
preference 
to 
others. 
He 
is 
in 
truththeir 
master, 
buthe 
is 
a 
goodandjust 
master; 
hispowerisabsolute, 
but 
his 
wisdom 
permits 
not 
that 
he 
exercise 
that 
power 
in 
an 
arbitrary 
and 
despotic 
way,whichwould 
betyrannousindeed. 


Moreover, 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
first 
man 
having 
happened 
only 
with 
God’s 
permission, 
and 
God 
having 
resolved 
to 
permit 
it 
only 
when 
once 
he 
had 
considered 
its 
consequences, 
which 
are 
the 
corruption 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
human 
race 
and 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
small 
number 
of 
elect, 
with 
the 
abandonment 
of 
all 
the 
rest, 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
conceal 
the 
difficulty 
by 
limiting 
one’s 
view 
to 
the 
mass 
already 
corrupt. 
One 
must, 
in 
spite 
of 
oneself, 
go 
back 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
first 
sin, 
preceding 
the 
decree 
whereby 
God 
permitted 
it, 
and 
whereby 
he 
permitted 
simultaneously 
that 
the 
damned 
should 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
mass 
of 
perdition 
and 
should 
not 
be 
delivered: 
for 
Godandthesagemakeno 
resolve 
without 
consideringitsconsequences. 


I 
hope 
to 
remove 
all 
these 
difficulties. 
I 
will 
point 
out 
that 
absolute 
necessity, 
which 
is 
called 
also 
logical 
and 
metaphysical 
and 
sometimes 
geometrical, 
and 
which 
would 
alone 
be 
formidable 
in 
this 
connexion, 
does 
not 
exist 
in 
free 
actions, 
and 
that 
thus 
freedom 
is 
exempt 
not 
only 
from 
constraintbut 
also 
from 
realnecessity. 
I 
will 
show 
that 
God 
himself,although 
he 
always 
chooses 
the 
best, 
does 
not 
act 
by 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
and 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
laid 
down 
by 
God, 
founded 
upon 
the 
fitness 
of 
things, 
keep 
the 
mean 
between 
geometrical 
truths, 
absolutely 
necessary, 
and 
arbitrary 
decrees; 
which 
M. 
Bayle 
and 
other 
modern 
philosophers 
have 
not 
sufficiently 
understood. 
Further 
I 
will 
show 
that 
there 
is 
an 
indifference 
in 
freedom, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
absolute 
necessity 
for 
one 
course 
or 
the 
other; 
but 
yet 
that 
there 
is 
never 
an 
indifference 
of 
perfect 
equipoise. 
And 
I 
will 
demonstrate 
that 
there 
is 
in 
free 
actions 
a 
perfect 
spontaneity 
beyond 
all 
that 
has 
been 



conceived 
hitherto. 
Finally 
I 
will 
make 
it 
plain 
that 
the 
hypothetical 
and 
the 
moral 
necessity 
which 
subsist 
in 
free 
actions 
are 
open 
to 
no 
objection, 
and 
that 
the 
‘LazyReason’ 
isapuresophism. 


Likewise 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
evil 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
God, 
I 
offer 
a 
vindication 
of 
his 
perfections 
that 
shall 
extol 
not 
less 
his 
holiness, 
his 
justice 
and 
his 
goodness 
than 
his 
greatness, 
his 
power 
and 
his 
independence. 
I 
show 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
everything 
to 
depend 
upon 
God, 
for 
him 
to 
co-operate 
in 
all 
the 
actions 
of 
creatures, 
even, 
if 
you 
will, 
to 
create 
these 
creatures 
continually, 
and 
nevertheless 
not 
to 
be 
the 
author 
of 
sin. 
Here 
also 
it 
is 
demonstrated 
how 
the 
privative 
nature 
of 
evil 
should 
be 
understood. 
Much 
more 
than 
that, 
I 
explain 
how 
evil 
has 
a 
source 
other 
than 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
and 
that 
one 
is 
right 
therefore 
to 
say 
of 
moral 
evil 
that 
God 
wills 
it 
not, 
but 
simply 
permits 
it. 
Most 
important 
of 
all, 
however, 
I 
show 
that 
it 
has 
been 
possible 
for 
God 
to 
permit 
sin 
and 
misery, 
and 
even 
to 
co-operate 
therein 
and 
promote 
it, 
without 
detriment 
to 
his 
holiness 
and 
his 
supreme 
goodness: 
although,generallyspeaking, 
hecould 
haveavoidedalltheseevils. 


Concerning 
grace 
and 
predestination, 
I 
justify 
the 
most 
debatable 
assertions, 
as 
for 
instance: 
that 
we 
are 
converted 
only 
through 
the 
prevenient 
grace 
of 
God 
and 
that 
we 
cannot 
do 
good 
except 
with 
his 
aid; 
that 
God 
wills 
the 
salvation 
of 
all 
men 
and 
that 
he 
condemns 
only 
those 
whose 
will 
is 
evil; 
that 
he 
gives 
to 
all 
a 
sufficient 
grace 
provided 
they 
wish 
to 
use 
it; 
that, 
Jesus 
Christ 
being 
the 
source 
and 
the 
centre 
of 
election, 
God 
destined 
the 
elect 
for 
salvation, 
because 
he 
foresaw 
that 
they 
would 
cling 
with 
a 
lively 
faith 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Jesus 
Christ. 
Yet 
it 
is 
true 
that 
this 
reason 
for 
election 
is 
not 
the 
final 
reason, 
and 
that 
this 
very 
pre-vision 
is 
still 
a 
consequence 
of 
God’s 
anterior 
decree. 
Faith 
likewise 
is 
a 
gift 
of 
God, 
who 
has 
predestinated 
the 
faith 
of 
the 
elect, 
for 
reasons 
lying 
in 
a 
superior 
decree 
which 
dispenses 
grace 
and 
circumstanceinaccordance 
withGod’s 
supremewisdom. 



Now, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
gifted 
men 
of 
our 
time, 
whose 
eloquence 
was 
as 
great 
as 
his 
acumen 
and 
who 
gave 
great 
proofs 
of 
his 
vast 
erudition, 
had 
applied 
himself 
with 
a 
strange 
predilection 
to 
call 
attention 
to 
all 
the 
difficulties 
on 
this 
subject 
which 
I 
have 
just 
touched 
in 
general, 
I 
found 
a 
fine 
field 
for 
exercise 
in 
considering 
the 
question 
with 
him 
in 
detail. 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
(for 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
I 
speak 
of 
him) 
has 
on 
hissideall 
the 
advantages 
except 
that 
ofthe 
rootofthematter,but 
I 
hope 
that 
truth 
(which 
he 
acknowledges 
himself 
to 
be 
on 
our 
side) 
by 
its 
very 
plainness, 
and 
provided 
it 
be 
fittingly 
set 
forth, 
will 
prevail 
over 
all 
the 
ornaments 
of 
eloquence 
and 
erudition. 
My 
hope 
for 
success 
therein 
is 
all 
the 
greater 
because 
it 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
God 
I 
plead, 
and 
because 
one 
of 
the 
maxims 
here 
upheld 
states 
that 
God’s 
help 
is 
never 
lacking 
for 
those 
that 
lack 
not 
goodwill. 
Theauthorofthisdiscoursebelievesthathe 
has 
givenproofof 
this 
good 
will 
in 
the 
attention 
he 
has 
brought 
to 
bear 
upon 
this 
subject. 
He 
has 
meditatedupon 
it 
since 
his 
youth; 
he 
has 
conferred 
withsome 
of 
the 
foremost 
men 
of 
the 
time; 
and 
he 
has 
schooled 
himself 
by 
the 
reading 
of 
good 
authors. 
And 
the 
success 
which 
God 
has 
given 
him 
(according 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
sundry 
competent 
judges) 
in 
certain 
other 
profound 
meditations, 
of 
which 
some 
have 
much 
influence 
on 
this 
subject, 
gives 
him 
peradventure 
some 
right 
to 
claim 
the 
attention 
of 
readers 
who 
love 
truth 
and 
are 
fitted 
to 
search 
after 
it. 


The 
author 
had, 
moreover, 
particular 
and 
weighty 
reasons 
inducing 
him 
to 
take 
pen 
in 
hand 
for 
discussion 
of 
this 
subject. 
Conversations 
which 
he 
had 
concerning 
the 
same 
with 
literary 
and 
court 
personages, 
in 
Germany 
and 
in 
France, 
and 
especially 
with 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
and 
most 
accomplished 
of 
princesses, 
have 
repeatedly 
prompted 
him 
to 
this 
course. 
He 
had 
had 
the 
honour 
of 
expressing 
his 
opinions 
to 
this 
Princess 
upon 
divers 
passages 
of 
the 
admirable 
Dictionary 
of 
M. 
Bayle, 
wherein 
religion 
and 
reason 
appear 
as 



adversaries, 
and 
where 
M. 
Bayle 
wishes 
to 
silence 
reason 
after 
having 
made 
it 
speak 
too 
loud: 
which 
he 
calls 
the 
triumph 
of 
faith. 
The 
present 
author 
declared 
there 
and 
then 
that 
he 
was 
of 
a 
different 
opinion, 
but 
that 
he 
was 
nevertheless 
well 
pleased 
that 
a 
man 
of 
such 
great 
genius 
had 
brought 
about 
an 
occasion 
for 
going 
deeplyinto 
these 
subjects, 
subjects 
as 
importantas 
they 
are 
difficult. 
He 
admitted 
having 
examined 
them 
also 
for 
some 
long 
time 
already, 
and 
having 
sometimes 
been 
minded 
to 
publish 
upon 
this 
matter 
some 
reflexions 
whose 
chief 
aim 
should 
be 
such 
knowledge 
of 
God 
as 
is 
needed 
to 
awaken 
piety 
and 
to 
foster 
virtue. 
This 
Princess 
exhorted 
and 
urged 
him 
to 
carry 
out 
his 
long-cherished 
intention, 
and 
some 
friends 
added 
their 
persuasions. 
He 
was 
all 
the 
more 
tempted 
to 
accede 
to 
their 
requests 
since 
he 
had 
reason 
to 
hope 
that 
in 
the 
sequel 
to 
his 
investigation 
M. 
Bayle’s 
genius 
would 
greatlyaid 
himto 
givethesubjectsuchilluminationas 
itmightreceive 
with 
his 
support. 
But 
divers 
obstacles 
intervened, 
and 
the 
death 
of 
the 
incomparable 
Queen 
was 
not 
the 
least. 
It 
happened, 
however, 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
was 
attacked 
by 
excellent 
men 
who 
set 
themselves 
to 
examine 
the 
same 
subject; 
he 
answered 
them 
fully 
and 
always 
ingeniously. 
I 
followed 
their 
dispute, 
and 
was 
even 
on 
the 
point 
of 
being 
involved 
therein. 
This 
is 
how 
it 
cameabout. 


I 
had 
published 
a 
new 
system, 
which 
seemed 
well 
adapted 
to 
explain 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body: 
it 
met 
with 
considerable 
applause 
even 
from 
those 
who 
were 
not 
in 
agreement 
with 
it, 
and 
certain 
competent 
persons 
testified 
that 
they 
had 
already 
been 
of 
my 
opinion, 
without 
having 
reached 
so 
distinct 
an 
explanation, 
before 
they 
saw 
what 
I 
had 
written 
on 
the 
matter. 
M. 
Bayle 
examined 
it 
in 
his 
Historical 
and 
Critical 
Dictionary, 
article 
‘Rorarius’. 
He 
thought 
that 
my 
expositions 
were 
worthy 
of 
further 
development; 
he 
drewattentionto 
their 
usefulness 
in 
variousconnexions, 
and 
he 
laid 
stress 
upon 
what 
might 
still 
cause 
difficulty. 
I 
could 
not 
but 
reply 
in 
a 



suitable 
way 
to 
expressions 
so 
civil 
and 
to 
reflexions 
so 
instructive 
as 
his. 
In 
order 
to 
turn 
them 
to 
greater 
account, 
I 
published 
some 
elucidations 
in 
the 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants, 
July 
1698. 
M. 
Bayle 
replied 
to 
them 
in 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
his 
Dictionary. 
I 
sent 
him 
a 
rejoinder 
which 
has 
not 
yet 
beenpublished;Iknownotwhetherhe 
evermadea 
furtherreply. 


Meanwhile 
it 
happened 
that 
M. 
le 
Clerc 
had 
inserted 
in 
his 
Select 
Library 
an 
extract 
from 
the 
Intellectual 
System 
of 
the 
late 
Mr. 
Cudworth, 
and 
had 
explainedthereincertain 
‘plasticnatures’ 
whichthisadmirableauthorapplied 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
animals. 
M. 
Bayle 
believed 
(see 
the 
continuation 
of 
Divers 
Thoughts 
on 
the 
Comet, 
ch. 
21, 
art. 
11) 
that, 
these 
natures 
being 
without 
cognition, 
in 
establishing 
them 
one 
weakened 
the 
argument 
which 
proves, 
through 
the 
marvellous 
formation 
of 
things, 
that 
the 
universe 
must 
have 
an 
intelligent 
Cause. 
M. 
le 
Clerc 
replied 
(4th 
art. 
of 
the 
5th 
vol. 
of 
his 
Select 
Library) 
that 
these 
natures 
required 
to 
be 
directed 
by 
divine 
wisdom. 


M. 
Bayle 
insisted 
(7th 
article 
of 
the 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants, 
August 
1704) 
that 
direction 
alone 
was 
not 
sufficient 
for 
a 
cause 
devoid 
of 
cognition, 
unless 
onetook 
thecause 
tobe 
amere 
instrument 
ofGod, 
in 
which 
case 
direction 
would 
be 
needless. 
My 
system 
was 
touched 
upon 
in 
passing; 
and 
that 
gave 
me 
an 
opportunity 
to 
send 
a 
short 
essay 
to 
the 
illustrious 
author 
of 
the 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvrages 
des 
Savants, 
which 
he 
inserted 
in 
the 
month 
of 
May 
1705, 
art. 
9. 
In 
this 
I 
endeavoured 
to 
make 
clear 
that 
in 
reality 
mechanism 
is 
sufficient 
to 
produce 
the 
organic 
bodies 
of 
animals, 
without 
any 
need 
of 
other 
plastic 
natures, 
provided 
there 
be 
added 
thereto 
the 
preformation 
already 
completely 
organic 
in 
the 
seeds 
of 
the 
bodies 
that 
come 
into 
existence, 
contained 
in 
those 
of 
the 
bodies 
whence 
they 
spring, 
right 
backto 
theprimaryseeds. 
Thiscould 
onlyproceedfromtheAuthorofthings, 
infinitely 
powerful 
and 
infinitely 
wise, 
who, 
creating 
all 
in 
the 
beginning 
in 
due 
order, 
had 
pre-established 
there 
all 
order 
and 
artifice 
that 
was 
to 
be. 

There 
is 
no 
chaos 
in 
the 
inward 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
there 
is 
organism 
everywhere 
in 
a 
matter 
whose 
disposition 
proceeds 
from 
God. 
More 
and 
more 
of 
it 
would 
come 
to 
light 
if 
we 
pressed 
closer 
our 
examination 
of 
the 
anatomy 
of 
bodies; 
and 
we 
should 
continue 
to 
observe 
it 
even 
if 
we 
could 
go 
on 
to 
infinity, 
like 
Nature, 
and 
make 
subdivision 
as 
continuous 
in 
our 
knowledge 
asNaturehasmadeitinfact. 


In 
order 
to 
explainthismarvel 
of 
the 
formationofanimals, 
I 
madeuseofa 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
the 
same 
means 
I 
had 
used 
to 
explain 
another 
marvel, 
namely 
the 
correspondence 
of 
soul 
with 
body, 
wherein 
I 
proved 
the 
uniformity 
and 
the 
fecundity 
of 
the 
principles 
I 
had 
employed. 
It 
seems 
that 
this 
reminded 
M. 
Bayle 
of 
my 
system 
of 
accounting 
for 
this 
correspondence, 
which 
he 
had 
examined 
formerly. 
He 
declared 
(in 
chapter 
180 
of 
his 
Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
III, 
) 
that 
he 
did 
not 
believe 
God 
could 
give 
to 
matter 
or 
to 
any 
other 
cause 
the 
faculty 
of 
becoming 
organic 
without 
communicating 
to 
it 
the 
idea 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
organic 
nature. 
Also 
he 
was 
not 
yet 
disposed 
to 
believe 
that 
God, 
with 
all 
his 
power 
over 
Nature 
and 
with 
all 
the 
foreknowledge 
which 
he 
has 
of 
the 
contingencies 
that 
may 
arrive, 
could 
have 
so 
disposed 
things 
that 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
mechanics 
alone 
a 
vessel 
(for 
instance) 
should 
go 
to 
its 
port 
of 
destination 
without 
being 
steered 
during 
its 
passage 
by 
some 
intelligent 
guide. 
I 
was 
surprised 
to 
see 
that 
limits 
were 
placed 
on 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
without 
the 
adduction 
of 
any 
proof 
and 
without 
indication 
that 
there 
was 
any 
contradiction 
to 
be 
feared 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
object 
or 
any 
imperfection 
on 
God’s 
side. 
Whereas 
I 
had 
shown 
before 
in 
my 
Rejoinderthat 
even 
men 
often 
produce 
through 
automata 
something 
like 
the 
movements 
that 
come 
from 
reason, 
and 
that 
even 
a 
finite 
mind 
(but 
one 
far 
above 
ours) 
could 
accomplish 
what 
M. 
Bayle 
thinks 
impossible 
to 
the 
Divinity. 
Moreover, 
as 
God 
orders 
all 
things 
at 
once 
beforehand, 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
path 
of 
this 
vessel 
would 
be 
no 



more 
strange 
than 
that 
of 
a 
fuse 
passing 
along 
a 
cord 
in 
fireworks, 
since 
the 
whole 
disposition 
of 
things 
preserves 
a 
perfect 
harmony 
between 
them 
by 
meansoftheirinfluenceoneupontheother. 


This 
declaration 
of 
M. 
Bayle 
pledged 
me 
to 
an 
answer. 
I 
therefore 
purposed 
to 
point 
out 
to 
him, 
that 
unless 
it 
be 
said 
that 
God 
forms 
organic 
bodies 
himself 
by 
a 
perpetual 
miracle, 
or 
that 
he 
has 
entrusted 
this 
care 
to 
intelligences 
whose 
power 
and 
knowledge 
are 
almost 
divine, 
we 
must 
hold 
the 
opinion 
that 
God 
preformed 
things 
in 
such 
sort 
that 
new 
organisms 
are 
only 
a 
mechanical 
consequence 
of 
a 
preceding 
organic 
constitution. 
Even 
so 
do 
butterflies 
come 
out 
of 
silkworms, 
an 
instance 
where 
M. 
Swammerdam 
has 
shown 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
but 
development. 
And 
I 
would 
have 
added 
that 
nothing 
is 
better 
qualified 
than 
the 
preformation 
of 
plants 
and 
of 
animals 
to 
confirm 
my 
System 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body. 
For 
in 
this 
the 
body 
is 
prompted 
by 
its 
original 
constitution 
to 
carry 
out 
with 
the 
help 
of 
external 
things 
all 
that 
it 
does 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
will 
of 
the 
soul. 
So 
the 
seeds 
by 
their 
original 
constitution 
carry 
out 
naturally 
the 
intentions 
of 
God, 
by 
an 
artifice 
greater 
still 
than 
that 
which 
causes 
our 
body 
to 
perform 
everything 
in 
conformity 
with 
our 
will. 
And 
since 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
deems 
with 
reason 
that 
there 
is 
more 
artifice 
in 
the 
organism 
of 
animalsthan 
in 
themost 
beautiful 
poem 
in 
theworldor 
in 
themost 
admirable 
invention 
whereof 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
capable, 
it 
follows 
that 
my 
system 
of 
the 
connexion 
between 
the 
body 
and 
the 
soul 
is 
as 
intelligible 
as 
the 
general 
opinion 
on 
the 
formation 
of 
animals. 
For 
this 
opinion 
(which 
appears 
to 
me 
true) 
states 
in 
effect 
that 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
has 
so 
made 
Nature 
that 
it 
is 
competent 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
laws 
to 
form 
animals; 
I 
explain 
this 
opinion 
and 
throw 
more 
light 
upon 
the 
possibility 
of 
it 
through 
the 
system 
of 
preformation. 
Whereafter 
there 
will 
be 
no 
cause 
for 
surprise 
that 
God 
has 
so 
made 
the 
body 
that 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
own 
laws 
it 
can 
carry 
out 
the 
intentions 
of 



the 
reasoning 
soul: 
for 
all 
that 
the 
reasoning 
soul 
can 
demand 
of 
the 
body 
is 
less 
difficult 
than 
the 
organization 
which 
God 
has 
demanded 
of 
the 
seeds. 
M. 
Bayle 
says 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
ch. 
182, 
) 
that 
it 
is 
only 
very 
recently 
there 
have 
been 
people 
who 
have 
understood 
that 
the 
formation 
of 
living 
bodies 
cannot 
be 
a 
natural 
process. 
This 
he 
could 
say 
also 
(in 
accordance 
with 
his 
principles) 
of 
the 
communication 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
since 
God 
effects 
this 
whole 
communication 
in 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes 
to 
which 
this 
author 
subscribes. 
But 
I 
admit 
the 
supernatural 
here 
only 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
things, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
first 
formation 
of 
animals 
or 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
original 
constitution 
of 
preestablished 
harmony 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body. 
Once 
that 
has 
come 
to 
pass, 
I 
hold 
that 
the 
formation 
of 
animals 
and 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body 
are 
something 
as 
natural 
now 
as 
the 
other 
most 
ordinary 
operations 
of 
Nature. 
A 
close 
parallel 
is 
afforded 
by 
people’s 
ordinary 
thinking 
about 
the 
instinct 
and 
the 
marvellous 
behaviour 
of 
brutes. 
One 
recognizes 
reason 
there 
not 
in 
the 
brutes 
but 
in 
him 
who 
created 
them. 
I 
am, 
then, 
of 
the 
general 
opinion 
in 
this 
respect; 
but 
I 
hope 
that 
my 
explanation 
will 
have 
added 
clearness 
and 
lucidity, 
and 
even 
a 
more 
ample 
range, 
to 
that 
opinion. 


Now 
when 
preparing 
to 
justify 
my 
system 
in 
face 
of 
the 
new 
difficulties 
of 


M. 
Bayle, 
I 
purposed 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
communicate 
to 
him 
the 
ideas 
which 
I 
had 
had 
for 
some 
time 
already, 
on 
the 
difficulties 
put 
forward 
by 
him 
in 
opposition 
to 
those 
who 
endeavour 
to 
reconcile 
reason 
with 
faith 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
evil. 
Indeed, 
there 
are 
perhaps 
few 
persons 
who 
have 
toiled 
more 
than 
I 
in 
this 
matter. 
Hardly 
had 
I 
gained 
some 
tolerable 
understanding 
of 
Latin 
writings 
when 
I 
had 
an 
opportunity 
of 
turning 
over 
books 
in 
a 
library. 
I 
flitted 
from 
book 
to 
book, 
and 
since 
subjects 
for 
meditation 
pleased 
me 
as 
much 
as 
histories 
and 
fables, 
I 
was 
charmed 
by 
the 

work 
of 
Laurentius 
Valla 
against 
Boethius 
and 
by 
that 
of 
Luther 
against 
Erasmus, 
although 
I 
was 
well 
aware 
that 
they 
had 
need 
of 
some 
mitigation. 
I 
did 
not 
omit 
books 
of 
controversy, 
and 
amongst 
other 
writings 
of 
this 
nature 
the 
records 
of 
the 
Montbéliard 
Conversation, 
which 
had 
revived 
the 
dispute, 
appearedto 
me 
instructive. 
NordidIneglectthe 
teachings 
ofourtheologians: 
and 
the 
study 
of 
their 
opponents, 
far 
from 
disturbing 
me, 
served 
to 
strengthen 
me 
in 
the 
moderate 
opinions 
of 
the 
Churches 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession. 
I 
had 
opportunity 
on 
my 
journeys 
to 
confer 
with 
some 
excellent 
men 
of 
different 
parties, 
for 
instance 
with 
Bishop 
Peter 
von 
Wallenburg, 
Suffragan 
of 
Mainz, 
with 
Herr 
Johann 
Ludwig 
Fabricius, 
premier 
theologian 
of 
Heidelberg, 
and 
finally 
with 
the 
celebrated 
M. 
Arnauld. 
To 
him 
I 
even 
tendered 
a 
Latin 
Dialogue 
of 
my 
own 
composition 
upon 
this 
subject, 
about 
the 
year 
1673, 
wherein 
already 
I 
laid 
it 
down 
that 
God, 
having 
chosen 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
all 
possible 
worlds, 
had 
been 
prompted 
by 
his 
wisdom 
to 
permit 
the 
evil 
which 
was 
bound 
up 
with 
it, 
but 
which 
still 
did 
not 
prevent 
this 
world 
from 
being, 
all 
things 
considered, 
the 
best 
that 
could 
be 
chosen. 
I 
have 
also 
since 
read 
many 
and 
various 
good 
authors 
on 
these 
subjects, 
and 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
make 
progress 
in 
the 
knowledge 
that 
seems 
to 
me 
proper 
for 
banishing 
all 
that 
could 
have 
obscured 
the 
idea 
of 
supreme 
perfection 
which 
must 
be 
acknowledged 
in 
God. 
I 
have 
not 
neglected 
to 
examine 
the 
most 
rigorous 
authors, 
who 
have 
extended 
furthest 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
things, 
as 
for 
instance 
Hobbes 
and 
Spinoza, 
of 
whom 
the 
former 
advocated 
this 
absolute 
necessity 
not 
only 
in 
his 
Physical 
Elements 
and 
elsewhere, 
but 
also 
in 
a 
special 
book 
against 
Bishop 
Bramhall. 
And 
Spinoza 
insists 
more 
or 
less 
(like 
an 
ancient 
Peripatetic 
philosopher 
named 
Strato) 
that 
all 
has 
come 
from 
the 
first 
cause 
or 
from 
primitive 
Nature 
by 
a 
blind 
and 
geometrical 
necessity, 
with 
complete 
absence 
of 
capacity 
for 
choice, 
for 
goodnessand 
for 
understandinginthisfirstsourceofthings. 



I 
have 
found 
the 
means, 
so 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
of 
demonstrating 
the 
contrary 
in 
a 
way 
that 
gives 
one 
a 
clear 
insight 
into 
the 
inward 
essence 
of 
the 
matter. 
For 
having 
made 
new 
discoveries 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
active 
force 
and 
the 
laws 
of 
motion, 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
they 
have 
no 
geometrical 
necessity, 
as 
Spinoza 
appears 
to 
have 
believed 
they 
had. 
Neither, 
as 
I 
have 
made 
plain, 
are 
they 
purely 
arbitrary, 
even 
though 
this 
be 
the 
opinion 
of 
M. 
Bayle 
and 
of 
some 
modern 
philosophers: 
but 
they 
are 
dependent 
upon 
the 
fitness 
of 
things 
as 
I 
have 
already 
pointed 
out 
above, 
or 
upon 
that 
which 
I 
call 
the 
‘principle 
of 
the 
best’. 
Moreover 
one 
recognizes 
therein, 
as 
in 
every 
other 
thing, 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
first 
substance, 
whose 
productions 
bear 
the 
stamp 
of 
a 
supreme 
wisdom 
and 
make 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
harmonies. 
I 
have 
shown 
also 
that 
this 
harmony 
connects 
both 
the 
future 
with 
the 
past 
and 
the 
present 
with 
the 
absent. 
The 
first 
kind 
of 
connexion 
unites 
times, 
and 
the 
other 
places. 
This 
second 
connexion 
is 
displayed 
in 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body, 
and 
in 
general 
in 
the 
communication 
of 
true 
substances 
with 
one 
another 
and 
with 
material 
phenomena. 
But 
the 
first 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
preformation 
of 
organic 
bodies, 
or 
rather 
of 
all 
bodies, 
since 
there 
is 
organism 
everywhere, 
although 
all 
masses 
do 
not 
compose 
organic 
bodies. 
So 
a 
pond 
may 
very 
well 
be 
full 
of 
fish 
or 
of 
other 
organic 
bodies, 
although 
it 
is 
not 
itself 
an 
animal 
or 
organic 
body, 
but 
only 
a 
mass 
that 
contains 
them. 
Thus 
I 
had 
endeavoured 
to 
build 
upon 
such 
foundations, 
established 
in 
a 
conclusive 
manner, 
a 
complete 
body 
of 
the 
main 
articles 
of 
knowledge 
that 
reason 
pure 
and 
simple 
can 
impart 
to 
us, 
a 
body 
whereof 
all 
the 
parts 
were 
properly 
connected 
and 
capable 
of 
meeting 
the 
most 
important 
difficulties 
of 
the 
ancients 
and 
the 
moderns. 
I 
had 
also 
in 
consequence 
formed 
for 
myself 
a 
certain 
system 
concerning 
the 
freedom 
of 
man 
and 
the 
cooperation 
of 
God. 
This 
system 
appeared 
to 
me 
to 
be 
such 
as 
would 
in 
no 
wise 
offend 
reason 
and 
faith; 
and 
I 
desired 
to 
submit 
it 
to 
the 



scrutiny 
of 
M. 
Bayle, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
those 
who 
are 
in 
controversy 
with 
him. 
Now 
he 
has 
departed 
from 
us, 
and 
such 
a 
loss 
is 
no 
small 
one, 
a 
writer 
whose 
learning 
and 
acumen 
few 
have 
equalled. 
But 
since 
the 
subject 
is 
under 
consideration 
and 
men 
of 
talent 
are 
still 
occupied 
with 
it, 
while 
the 
public 
also 
follows 
it 
attentively, 
I 
take 
this 
to 
be 
a 
fitting 
moment 
for 
the 
publicationof 
certainofmyideas. 


It 
will 
perhaps 
be 
well 
to 
add 
the 
observation, 
before 
finishing 
this 
preface, 
that 
in 
denying 
the 
physical 
influence 
of 
the 
soul 
upon 
the 
body 
or 
of 
the 
body 
upon 
the 
soul, 
that 
is, 
an 
influence 
causing 
the 
one 
to 
disturb 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
other, 
I 
by 
no 
means 
deny 
the 
union 
of 
the 
one 
with 
the 
other 
which 
forms 
of 
them 
a 
suppositum; 
but 
this 
union 
is 
something 
metaphysical, 
which 
changes 
nothing 
in 
the 
phenomena. 
This 
is 
what 
I 
have 
already 
said 
in 
reply 
to 
the 
objection 
raised 
against 
me, 
in 
the 
Mémoires 
de 
Trévoux, 
by 
the 
Reverend 
Father 
de 
Tournemine, 
whose 
wit 
and 
learning 
are 
of 
no 
ordinary 
mould. 
And 
for 
this 
reason 
one 
may 
say 
also 
in 
a 
metaphysical 
sense 
that 
the 
soul 
acts 
upon 
the 
body 
and 
the 
body 
upon 
the 
soul. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
the 
Entelechy 
or 
the 
active 
principle, 
whereas 
the 
corporeal 
alone 
or 
the 
mere 
material 
contains 
only 
the 
passive. 
Consequently 
the 
principle 
of 
action 
is 
in 
the 
soul, 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
more 
than 
once 
in 
the 
Leipzig 
Journal. 
More 
especially 
does 
this 
appear 
in 
my 
answer 
to 
the 
late 
Herr 
Sturm, 
philosopher 
and 
mathematician 
of 
Altorf, 
where 
I 
have 
even 
demonstrated 
that, 
if 
bodies 
contained 
only 
the 
passive, 
their 
different 
conditions 
would 
be 
indistinguishable. 
Also 
I 
take 
this 
opportunity 
to 
say 
that, 
having 
heard 
of 
some 
objections 
made 
by 
the 
gifted 
author 
of 
the 
book 
on 
Self-knowledge, 
in 
that 
same 
book, 
to 
my 
System 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
I 
sent 
a 
reply 
to 
Paris, 
showing 
that 
he 
has 
attributed 
to 
me 
opinions 
I 
am 
far 
from 
holding. 
On 
another 
matter 
recently 
I 
met 
with 
like 
treatment 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
an 
anonymous 
Doctor 
of 
the 
Sorbonne. 
And 
these 



misconceptions 
would 
have 
become 
plain 
to 
the 
reader 
at 
the 
outset 
if 
my 
ownwords,whichwerebeingtakeninevidence,had 
been 
quoted. 


This 
tendency 
of 
men 
to 
make 
mistakes 
in 
presenting 
the 
opinions 
of 
others 
leads 
me 
to 
observe 
also, 
that 
when 
I 
said 
somewhere 
that 
man 
helps 
himself 
in 
conversion 
through 
the 
succour 
of 
grace, 
I 
mean 
only 
that 
he 
derives 
advantage 
from 
it 
through 
the 
cessation 
of 
the 
resistance 
overcome, 
but 
without 
any 
cooperation 
on 
his 
part: 
just 
as 
there 
is 
no 
co-operation 
in 
ice 
when 
it 
is 
broken. 
For 
conversion 
is 
purely 
the 
work 
of 
God’s 
grace, 
wherein 
man 
co-operates 
only 
by 
resisting 
it; 
but 
human 
resistance 
is 
more 
or 
less 
great 
according 
to 
the 
persons 
and 
the 
occasions. 
Circumstances 
also 
contribute 
more 
or 
less 
to 
our 
attention 
and 
to 
the 
motions 
that 
arise 
in 
the 
soul; 
and 
the 
co-operation 
of 
all 
these 
things, 
together 
with 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
impression 
and 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
will, 
determines 
the 
operation 
of 
grace, 
although 
not 
rendering 
it 
necessary. 
I 
have 
expounded 
sufficiently 
elsewhere 
that 
inrelationtomattersofsalvationunregenerateman 
isto 
beconsideredas 
dead; 
and 
I 
greatly 
approve 
the 
manner 
wherein 
the 
theologians 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
declare 
themselves 
on 
this 
subject. 
Yet 
this 
corruption 
of 
unregenerate 
man 
is, 
it 
must 
be 
added, 
no 
hindrance 
to 
his 
possession 
of 
true 
moral 
virtues 
and 
his 
performance 
of 
good 
actions 
in 
his 
civic 
life, 
actions 
which 
spring 
from 
a 
good 
principle, 
without 
any 
evil 
intention 
and 
without 
mixture 
of 
actual 
sin. 
Wherein 
I 
hope 
I 
shall 
be 
forgiven, 
if 
I 
have 
dared 
to 
diverge 
from 
the 
opinion 
of 
St. 
Augustine: 
he 
was 
doubtless 
a 
great 
man, 
of 
admirable 
intelligence, 
but 
inclined 
sometimes, 
as 
it 
seems, 
to 
exaggerate 
things, 
above 
all 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
his 
controversies. 
I 
greatly 
esteem 
some 
persons 
who 
profess 
to 
be 
disciples 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
amongst 
others 
the 
Reverend 
Father 
Quênel, 
a 
worthy 
successor 
of 
the 
great 
Arnauld 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
controversies 
that 
have 
embroiled 
them 
with 
the 
most 
famous 
of 
Societies. 
But 
I 
have 
found 
that 
usually 
in 
disputes 
between 
people 
of 



conspicuous 
merit 
(of 
whom 
there 
are 
doubtless 
some 
here 
in 
both 
parties) 
there 
is 
right 
on 
both 
sides, 
although 
in 
different 
points, 
and 
it 
is 
rather 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
defence 
than 
attack, 
although 
the 
natural 
malevolence 
of 
the 
human 
heart 
generally 
renders 
attack 
more 
agreeable 
to 
the 
reader 
than 
defence. 
I 
hope 
that 
the 
Reverend 
Father 
Ptolemei, 
who 
does 
his 
Society 
credit 
and 
is 
occupied 
in 
filling 
the 
gaps 
left 
by 
the 
famous 
Bellarmine, 
will 
give 
us, 
concerning 
all 
of 
that, 
some 
explanations 
worthy 
of 
his 
acumen 
and 
his 
knowledge, 
and 
I 
even 
dare 
to 
add, 
his 
moderation. 
And 
one 
must 
believe 
that 
among 
the 
theologians 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
there 
will 
arise 
some 
new 
Chemnitz 
or 
some 
new 
Callixtus; 
even 
as 
one 
is 
justified 
in 
thinking 
that 
men 
like 
Usserius 
or 
Daillé 
will 
again 
appear 
among 
the 
Reformed, 
and 
that 
all 
will 
work 
more 
and 
more 
to 
remove 
the 
misconceptions 
wherewith 
this 
matter 
is 
charged. 
For 
the 
rest 
I 
shall 
be 
well 
pleased 
that 
those 
who 
shall 
wish 
to 
examine 
it 
closely 
read 
the 
objections 
with 
the 
answers 
I 
have 
given 
thereto, 
formulated 
in 
the 
small 
treatise 
I 
have 
placed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
work 
by 
way 
of 
summary. 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
forestall 
some 
new 
objections. 
I 
have 
explained, 
for 
instance, 
why 
I 
have 
taken 
the 
antecedent 
and 
consequent 
will 
as 
preliminary 
and 
final, 
after 
the 
example 
of 
Thomas, 
of 
Scotus 
and 
others; 
how 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
there 
be 
incomparably 
more 
good 
in 
the 
glory 
of 
all 
the 
saved 
than 
there 
is 
evil 
in 
the 
misery 
of 
all 
the 
damned, 
despite 
that 
there 
are 
more 
of 
the 
latter; 
how, 
in 
saying 
that 
evil 
has 
been 
permitted 
as 
a 
conditio 
sine 
qua 
non 
of 
good, 
I 
mean 
not 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
necessity, 
but 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
fitness 
of 
things. 
Furthermore 
I 
show 
that 
the 
predetermination 
I 
admit 
is 
such 
as 
always 
to 
predispose, 
but 
never 
to 
necessitate, 
and 
that 
God 
will 
not 
refuse 
the 
requisite 
new 
light 
to 
those 
who 
have 
made 
a 
good 
use 
of 
that 
which 
they 
had. 
Other 
elucidations 
besides 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
give 
on 
some 
difficulties 
which 
have 
been 
put 
before 
me 
of 
late. 
I 
have, 
moreover, 
followed 
the 
advice 
of 
some 
friends 
who 



thought 
it 
fitting 
that 
I 
should 
add 
two 
appendices: 
the 
one 
treats 
of 
the 
controversy 
carried 
on 
between 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
and 
Bishop 
Bramhall 
touching 
Freedom 
and 
Necessity, 
the 
other 
of 
the 
learned 
work 
on 
The 
Origin 
of 
Evil, 
publishedashorttimeagoinEngland. 


Finally 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
in 
all 
things 
to 
consider 
edification: 
and 
if 
I 
have 
conceded 
something 
to 
curiosity, 
it 
is 
because 
I 
thought 
it 
necessary 
to 
relieve 
a 
subject 
whose 
seriousness 
may 
cause 
discouragement. 
It 
is 
with 
that 
in 
view 
that 
I 
have 
introduced 
into 
this 
dissertation 
the 
pleasing 
chimera 
of 
a 
certain 
astronomical 
theology, 
having 
no 
ground 
for 
apprehension 
that 
it 
will 
ensnare 
anyone 
and 
deeming 
that 
to 
tell 
it 
and 
refute 
it 
is 
the 
same 
thing. 
Fiction 
for 
fiction, 
instead 
of 
imagining 
that 
the 
planets 
were 
suns, 
one 
might 
conceive 
that 
they 
were 
masses 
melted 
in 
the 
sun 
and 
thrown 
out, 
and 
that 
would 
destroy 
the 
foundation 
of 
this 
hypothetical 
theology. 
The 
ancient 
error 
of 
the 
two 
principles, 
which 
the 
Orientals 
distinguished 
by 
the 
names 
Oromasdes 
and 
Arimanius, 
caused 
me 
to 
explain 
a 
conjecture 
on 
the 
primitive 
history 
of 
peoples. 
It 
appears 
indeed 
probable 
that 
these 
were 
the 
names 
of 
two 
great 
contemporary 
princes, 
the 
one 
monarch 
of 
a 
part 
of 
upper 
Asia, 
where 
there 
have 
since 
been 
others 
of 
this 
name, 
the 
other 
king 
of 
the 
Scythian 
Celts 
who 
made 
incursions 
into 
the 
states 
of 
the 
former, 
and 
who 
was 
also 
named 
amongst 
the 
divinities 
of 
Germania. 
It 
seems, 
indeed, 
that 
Zoroaster 
used 
the 
names 
of 
these 
princes 
as 
symbols 
of 
the 
invisible 
powers 
which 
their 
exploits 
made 
them 
resemble 
in 
the 
ideas 
of 
Asiatics. 
Yet 
elsewhere, 
according 
to 
the 
accounts 
of 
Arab 
authors, 
who 
in 
this 
might 
well 
be 
better 
informed 
than 
the 
Greeks, 
it 
appears 
from 
detailed 
records 
of 
ancient 
oriental 
history, 
that 
this 
Zerdust 
or 
Zoroaster, 
whom 
they 
make 
contemporary 
with 
the 
great 
Darius, 
did 
not 
look 
upon 
these 
two 
principles 
as 
completely 
primitive 
and 
independent, 
but 
as 
dependent 
upon 
one 
supreme 
and 
single 
principle. 
They 
relate 
that 
he 
believed, 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 



cosmogony 
of 
Moses, 
that 
God, 
who 
is 
without 
an 
equal, 
created 
all 
and 
separated 
the 
light 
from 
the 
darkness; 
that 
the 
light 
conformed 
with 
his 
original 
design, 
but 
that 
the 
darkness 
came 
as 
a 
consequence, 
even 
as 
the 
shadow 
follows 
the 
body, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
nothing 
but 
privation. 
Such 
a 
thesis 
would 
clear 
this 
ancient 
author 
of 
the 
errors 
the 
Greeks 
imputed 
to 
him. 
His 
great 
learning 
caused 
the 
Orientals 
to 
compare 
him 
with 
the 
Mercury 
or 
Hermes 
of 
the 
Egyptians 
and 
Greeks; 
just 
as 
the 
northern 
peoples 
compared 
their 
Wodan 
or 
Odin 
to 
this 
same 
Mercury. 
That 
is 
why 
Mercredi 
(Wednesday), 
or 
the 
day 
of 
Mercury, 
was 
called 
Wodansdag 
by 
the 
northern 
peoples, 
but 
day 
of 
Zerdust 
by 
the 
Asiatics, 
since 
it 
is 
named 
Zarschamba 
or 
Dsearschambe 
by 
the 
Turks 
and 
the 
Persians, 
Zerda 
by 
the 
Hungarians 
from 
the 
north-east, 
and 
Sreda 
by 
the 
Slavs 
from 
the 
heart 
of 
Great 
Russia, 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Wends 
of 
the 
Luneburg 
region, 
the 
Slavs 
having 
learnt 
the 
name 
also 
from 
the 
Orientals. 
These 
observations 
will 
perhaps 
not 
be 
displeasing 
to 
the 
curious. 
AndI 
flattermyselfthatthesmalldialogueending 
theEssayswritten 
to 
oppose 
M. 
Bayle 
will 
give 
some 
satisfaction 
to 
those 
who 
are 
well 
pleased 
to 
see 
difficult 
but 
important 
truths 
set 
forth 
in 
an 
easy 
and 
familiar 
way. 
I 
have 
written 
in 
a 
foreign 
language 
at 
the 
risk 
of 
making 
many 
errors 
in 
it, 
because 
that 
language 
has 
been 
recently 
used 
by 
others 
in 
treating 
of 
my 
subject, 
and 
because 
it 
is 
more 
generally 
read 
by 
those 
whom 
one 
would 
wish 
to 
benefit 
by 
this 
small 
work. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
the 
language 
errors 
will 
be 
pardoned: 
they 
are 
to 
be 
attributed 
not 
only 
to 
the 
printer 
and 
the 
copyist, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
haste 
of 
the 
author, 
who 
has 
been 
much 
distracted 
from 
his 
task. 
If, 
moreover, 
any 
error 
has 
crept 
into 
the 
ideas 
expressed, 
the 
author 
will 
be 
the 
first 
to 
correct 
it, 
once 
he 
has 
been 
better 
informed: 
he 
has 
given 
elsewhere 
such 
indications 
of 
his 
love 
of 
truth 
that 
he 
hopes

PRELIMINARY 
DISSERTATION 
ON 
THE 
CONFORMITY 


OF 
FAITH 
WITH 
REASON 



1. 
I 
BEGIN 
with 
the 
preliminary 
question 
of 
the 
conformity 
of 
faith 
with 
reason, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
philosophy 
in 
theology, 
because 
it 
has 
much 
influence 
on 
the 
main 
subject 
of 
my 
treatise, 
and 
because 
M. 
Bayle 
introduces 
it 
everywhere. 
I 
assume 
that 
two 
truths 
cannot 
contradict 
each 
other; 
that 
the 
object 
of 
faith 
is 
the 
truth 
God 
has 
revealed 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
way; 
and 
that 
reason 
is 
the 
linking 
together 
of 
truths, 
but 
especially 
(when 
it 
is 
compared 
with 
faith) 
of 
those 
whereto 
the 
human 
mind 
can 
attain 
naturally 
without 
being 
aided 
by 
the 
light 
of 
faith. 
This 
definition 
of 
reason 
(that 
is 
to 
say 
of 
strict 
and 
true 
reason) 
has 
surprised 
some 
persons 
accustomed 
to 
inveigh 
against 
reason 
taken 
in 
a 
vague 
sense. 
They 
gave 
me 
the 
answer 
that 
they 
had 
never 
heard 
of 
any 
such 
explanation 
of 
it: 
the 
truth 
is 
that 
they 
have 
never 
conferred 
with 
people 
who 
expressed 
themselves 
clearly 
on 
these 
subjects. 
They 
have 
confessed 
to 
me, 
nevertheless, 
that 
one 
could 
not 
find 
fault 
with 
reason, 
understood 
in 
the 
sense 
which 
I 
gave 
to 
it. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
that 
sometimes 
reason 
is 
contrasted 
with 
experience. 
Reason, 
since 
it 
consists 
in 
the 
linking 
together 
of 
truths, 
is 
entitled 
to 
connect 
also 
those 
wherewith 
experience 
has 
furnished 
it, 
in 
order 
thence 
to 
draw 
mixed 
conclusions; 
but 
reason 
pure 
and 
simple, 
as 
distinct 
from 
experience, 
only 
has 
to 
do 
with 
truths 
independent 
of 
the 
senses. 
And 
one 
may 
compare 
faith 
with 
experience, 
since 
faith 
(in 
respect 
of 
the 
motives 
that 
give 
it 
justification) 
depends 
upon 
the 
experience 
of 
those 
who 
have 
seen 
the 
miracles 
whereon 
revelation 
is 
founded, 
and 
upon 
the 
trustworthy 
tradition 
which 
has 
handed 
them 
down 
to 
us, 
whether 
through 
the 
Scriptures 
or 
by 
the 
account 
of 
those 
who 
have 
preserved 
them. 
It 
is 
rather 
as 
we 
rely 
upon 
the 
experience 
of 
those 

who 
have 
seen 
China 
and 
on 
the 
credibility 
of 
their 
account 
when 
we 
give 
credence 
to 
the 
wonders 
that 
are 
told 
us 
of 
that 
distant 
country. 
Yet 
I 
would 
also 
take 
into 
account 
the 
inward 
motion 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit, 
who 
takes 
possession 
of 
souls 
and 
persuades 
them 
and 
prompts 
them 
to 
good, 
that 
is, 
to 
faithandtocharity, 
without 
alwayshavingneedofmotives. 


2. 
Now 
the 
truths 
of 
reason 
are 
of 
two 
kinds: 
the 
one 
kind 
is 
of 
those 
called 
the 
‘Eternal 
Verities’, 
which 
are 
altogether 
necessary, 
so 
that 
the 
opposite 
implies 
contradiction. 
Such 
are 
the 
truths 
whose 
necessity 
is 
logical, 
metaphysical 
or 
geometrical, 
which 
one 
cannot 
deny 
without 
being 
led 
into 
absurdities. 
There 
are 
others 
which 
may 
be 
called 
positive, 
because 
they 
are 
the 
laws 
which 
it 
has 
pleased 
God 
to 
give 
to 
Nature, 
or 
because 
they 
depend 
upon 
those. 
We 
learn 
them 
either 
by 
experience, 
that 
is, 
a 
posteriori, 
or 
by 
reason 
and 
a 
priori, 
that 
is, 
by 
considerations 
of 
the 
fitness 
of 
things 
which 
have 
caused 
their 
choice. 
This 
fitness 
of 
things 
has 
also 
its 
rules 
and 
reasons, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
free 
choice 
of 
God, 
and 
not 
a 
geometrical 
necessity, 
which 
causes 
preference 
for 
what 
is 
fitting 
and 
brings 
it 
into 
existence. 
Thus 
one 
may 
say 
that 
physical 
necessity 
is 
founded 
on 
moral 
necessity, 
that 
is, 
on 
the 
wise 
one’s 
choice 
which 
is 
worthy 
of 
his 
wisdom; 
and 
that 
both 
of 
these 
ought 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
geometrical 
necessity. 
It 
is 
this 
physical 
necessity 
that 
makes 
order 
in 
Nature 
and 
lies 
in 
the 
rules 
of 
motion 
and 
in 
some 
other 
general 
laws 
which 
it 
pleased 
God 
to 
lay 
down 
for 
things 
when 
he 
gave 
them 
being. 
It 
is 
therefore 
true 
that 
God 
gave 
such 
laws 
not 
without 
reason, 
for 
he 
chooses 
nothing 
from 
caprice 
and 
as 
though 
by 
chance 
or 
in 
pure 
indifference; 
but 
the 
general 
reasons 
of 
good 
and 
of 
order, 
which 
have 
prompted 
him 
to 
the 
choice, 
may 
be 
overcome 
in 
some 
cases 
by 
stronger 
reasonsofasuperiororder. 
3. 
Thus 
it 
is 
made 
clear 
that 
God 
can 
exempt 
creatures 
from 
the 
laws 
he 
has 
prescribed 
for 
them, 
and 
produce 
in 
them 
that 
which 
their 
nature 
does 
not 

bear 
by 
performing 
a 
miracle. 
When 
they 
have 
risen 
to 
perfections 
and 
faculties 
nobler 
than 
those 
whereto 
they 
can 
by 
their 
nature 
attain, 
the 
Schoolmen 
call 
this 
faculty 
an 
‘Obediential 
Power’, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
power 
which 
the 
thing 
acquires 
by 
obeying 
the 
command 
of 
him 
who 
can 
give 
that 
which 
the 
thing 
has 
not. 
The 
Schoolmen, 
however, 
usually 
give 
instances 
of 
this 
power 
which 
to 
me 
appear 
impossible: 
they 
maintain, 
for 
example, 
that 
God 
can 
give 
the 
creature 
the 
faculty 
to 
create. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
there 
are 
miracles 
which 
God 
performs 
through 
the 
ministry 
of 
angels, 
where 
the 
laws 
of 
Nature 
are 
not 
violated, 
any 
more 
than 
when 
men 
assist 
Nature 
by 
art, 
the 
skill 
of 
angels 
differing 
from 
ours 
only 
by 
degree 
of 
perfection. 
Nevertheless 
it 
still 
remains 
true 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
Nature 
are 
subject 
to 
be 
dispensed 
from 
by 
the 
Law-giver; 
whereas 
the 
eternal 
verities, 
as 
for 
instance 
those 
of 
geometry, 
admit 
no 
dispensation, 
and 
faith 
cannot 
contradict 
them. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
there 
cannot 
be 
any 
invincible 
objection 
to 
truth. 
For 
if 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
proof 
which 
is 
founded 
upon 
principles 
or 
incontestable 
facts 
and 
formed 
by 
a 
linking 
together 
of 
eternal 
verities, 
the 
conclusion 
is 
certain 
and 
essential, 
and 
that 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
it 
must 
be 
false; 
otherwise 
two 
contradictories 
might 
be 
true 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
If 
the 
objection 
is 
not 
conclusive, 
it 
can 
only 
form 
a 
probable 
argument, 
which 
has 
no 
force 
against 
faith, 
since 
it 
is 
agreed 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
of 
religion 
are 
contrary 
to 
appearances. 
Now 
M. 
Bayle 
declares, 
in 
his 
posthumous 
Reply 
to 
M. 
le 
Clerc, 
that 
he 
does 
not 
claim 
that 
there 
are 
demonstrations 
contrary 
to 
the 
truths 
of 
faith: 
and 
as 
a 
result 
all 
these 
insuperable 
difficulties, 
these 
so-called 
wars 
between 
reason 
and 
faith, 
vanish 
away.

4. 
Protestant 
theologians 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
the 
Roman 
confession 
admit 
the 
maxims 
which 
I 
have 
just 
laid 
down, 
when 
they 
handle 
the 
matter 
with 

attention; 
and 
all 
that 
is 
said 
against 
reason 
has 
no 
force 
save 
against 
a 
kind 
of 
counterfeit 
reason, 
corrupted 
and 
deluded 
by 
false 
appearances. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
our 
notions 
of 
the 
justice 
and 
the 
goodness 
of 
God, 
which 
are 
spoken 
of 
sometimes 
as 
if 
we 
had 
neither 
any 
idea 
nor 
any 
definition 
of 
their 
nature. 
But 
in 
that 
case 
we 
should 
have 
no 
ground 
for 
ascribing 
these 
attributes 
to 
him, 
or 
lauding 
him 
for 
them. 
His 
goodness 
and 
his 
justice 
as 
well 
as 
his 
wisdom 
differ 
from 
ours 
only 
because 
they 
are 
infinitely 
more 
perfect. 
Thus 
the 
simple 
notions, 
the 
necessary 
truths 
and 
the 
conclusive 
results 
of 
philosophy 
cannot 
be 
contrary 
to 
revelation. 
And 
when 
some 
philosophical 
maxims 
are 
rejected 
in 
theology, 
the 
reason 
is 
that 
they 
are 
considered 
to 
have 
only 
a 
physical 
or 
moral 
necessity, 
which 
speaks 
only 
of 
that 
which 
takes 
place 
usually, 
and 
is 
consequently 
founded 
on 
appearances, 
butwhich 
maybewithheld 
ifGod 
sopleases. 


5. 
It 
seems, 
according 
to 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said, 
that 
there 
is 
often 
some 
confusion 
in 
the 
expressions 
of 
those 
who 
set 
at 
variance 
philosophy 
and 
theology, 
or 
faith 
and 
reason: 
they 
confuse 
the 
terms 
‘explain’, 
‘comprehend’, 
‘prove’, 
‘uphold’. 
And 
I 
find 
thatM. 
Bayle, 
shrewdashe 
is,is 
not 
always 
free 
from 
this 
confusion. 
Mysteries 
may 
be 
explained 
sufficiently 
to 
justify 
belief 
in 
them; 
but 
one 
cannot 
comprehend 
them, 
nor 
give 
understanding 
of 
how 
they 
come 
to 
pass. 
Thus 
even 
in 
natural 
philosophy 
we 
explain 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point 
sundry 
perceptible 
qualities, 
but 
in 
an 
imperfect 
manner, 
for 
we 
do 
not 
comprehend 
them. 
Nor 
is 
it 
possible 
for 
us, 
either, 
to 
prove 
Mysteries 
by 
reason; 
for 
all 
that 
which 
can 
be 
proved 
a 
priori, 
or 
by 
pure 
reason, 
can 
be 
comprehended. 
All 
that 
remains 
for 
us 
then, 
after 
having 
believed 
in 
the 
Mysteries 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
proofs 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
religion 
(whicharecalled 
‘motivesofcredibility’)is 
tobeable 
to 
uphold 
them 
against 
objections. 
Without 
that 
our 
belief 
in 
them 
would 
have 
no 
firm 
foundation; 
for 
all 
that 
which 
can 
be 
refuted 
in 
a 
sound 
and 
conclusive 
manner 
cannot 
but 

be 
false. 
And 
such 
proofs 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
religion 
as 
can 
give 
only 
a 
moral 
certainty 
would 
be 
balanced 
and 
even 
outweighed 
by 
such 
objections 
as 
would 
give 
an 
absolute 
certainty, 
provided 
they 
were 
convincing 
and 
altogether 
conclusive. 
This 
little 
might 
suffice 
me 
to 
remove 
the 
difficulties 
concerning 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
and 
philosophy 
in 
relation 
to 
religion 
if 
one 
had 
not 
to 
deal 
all 
too 
often 
with 
prejudiced 
persons. 
But 
as 
the 
subject 
is 
importantandithas 
fallen 
into 
a 
stateof 
confusion, 
it 
willbe 
well 
totakeitin

6. 
The 
question 
of 
the 
conformity 
of 
faith 
with 
reason 
has 
always 
been 
a 
great 
problem. 
In 
the 
primitive 
Church 
the 
ablest 
Christian 
authors 
adapted 
themselves 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
Platonists, 
which 
were 
the 
most 
acceptable 
to 
them, 
and 
were 
at 
that 
time 
most 
generally 
in 
favour. 
Little 
by 
little 
Aristotle 
took 
the 
place 
of 
Plato, 
when 
the 
taste 
for 
systems 
began 
to 
prevail, 
and 
when 
theology 
itself 
became 
more 
systematic, 
owing 
to 
the 
decisions 
of 
the 
General 
Councils, 
which 
provided 
precise 
and 
positive 
formularies. 
St. 
Augustine, 
Boethius 
and 
Cassiodorus 
in 
the 
West, 
and 
St. 
John 
of 
Damascus 
in 
the 
East 
contributed 
most 
towards 
reducing 
theology 
to 
scientific 
form, 
not 
to 
mention 
Bede, 
Alcuin, 
St. 
Anselm 
and 
some 
other 
theologians 
versed 
in 
philosophy. 
Finally 
came 
the 
Schoolmen. 
The 
leisure 
of 
the 
cloisters 
giving 
full 
scope 
for 
speculation, 
which 
was 
assisted 
by 
Aristotle’s 
philosophy 
translated 
from 
the 
Arabic, 
there 
was 
formed 
at 
last 
a 
compound 
of 
theology 
and 
philosophy 
wherein 
most 
of 
the 
questions 
arose 
from 
the 
trouble 
that 
was 
taken 
to 
reconcile 
faith 
with 
reason. 
But 
this 
had 
not 
met 
with 
the 
full 
success 
hoped 
for, 
because 
theology 
had 
been 
much 
corrupted 
by 
the 
unhappiness 
of 
the 
times, 
by 
ignorance 
and 
obstinacy. 
Moreover, 
philosophy, 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
own 
faults, 
which 
were 
very 
great, 
found 
itself 
burdened 
with 
those 
of 
theology, 
which 
in 
its 
turn 
was 
suffering 
from 
association 
with 
a 
philosophy 
that 
was 
very 
obscure 
and 
very 
imperfect. 
One 
must 
confess, 

notwithstanding, 
with 
the 
incomparable 
Grotius, 
that 
there 
is 
sometimes 
gold 
hidden 
under 
the 
rubbish 
of 
the 
monks’ 
barbarous 
Latin. 
I 
have 
therefore 
ofttimes 
wished 
that 
a 
man 
of 
talent, 
whose 
office 
had 
necessitated 
his 
learning 
the 
language 
of 
the 
Schoolmen, 
had 
chosen 
to 
extract 
thence 
whatever 
is 
of 
worth, 
and 
that 
another 
Petau 
or 
Thomasius 
had 
done 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Schoolmen 
what 
these 
two 
learned 
men 
have 
done 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Fathers. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
very 
curious 
work, 
and 
very 
important 
for 
ecclesiastical 
history, 
and 
it 
would 
continue 
the 
History 
of 
Dogmas 
up 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Revival 
of 
Letters 
(owing 
to 
which 
the 
aspect 
of 
things 
has 
changed) 
and 
even 
beyond 
that 
point. 
For 
sundry 
dogmas, 
such 
as 
those 
of 
physical 
predetermination, 
of 
mediate 
knowledge, 
philosophical 
sin, 
objective 
precisions, 
and 
many 
other 
dogmas 
in 
speculative 
theology 
and 
even 
in 
the 
practical 
theology 
of 
cases 
of 
conscience, 
cameintocurrencyeven 
after 
the 
CouncilofTrent. 


7. 
A 
little 
before 
these 
changes, 
and 
before 
the 
great 
schism 
in 
the 
West 
that 
still 
endures, 
there 
was 
in 
Italy 
a 
sect 
of 
philosophers 
which 
disputed 
this 
conformity 
of 
faith 
with 
reason 
which 
I 
maintain. 
They 
were 
dubbed 
‘Averroists’ 
because 
they 
were 
adherents 
of 
a 
famous 
Arab 
author, 
who 
was 
called 
the 
Commentator 
by 
pre-eminence, 
and 
who 
appeared 
to 
be 
the 
one 
of 
all 
his 
race 
that 
penetrated 
furthest 
into 
Aristotle’s 
meaning. 
This 
Commentator, 
extending 
what 
Greek 
expositors 
had 
already 
taught, 
maintained 
that 
according 
to 
Aristotle, 
and 
even 
according 
to 
reason 
(and 
at 
that 
time 
the 
two 
were 
considered 
almost 
identical) 
there 
was 
no 
case 
for 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul. 
Here 
is 
his 
reasoning. 
The 
human 
kind 
is 
eternal, 
according 
to 
Aristotle, 
therefore 
if 
individual 
souls 
die 
not, 
one 
must 
resort 
to 
the 
metempsychosis 
rejected 
by 
that 
philosopher. 
Or, 
if 
there 
are 
always 
new 
souls, 
one 
must 
admit 
the 
infinity 
of 
these 
souls 
existing 
from 
all 
eternity; 
but 
actual 
infinity 
is 
impossible, 
according 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
same 
Aristotle. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
a 
necessary 
conclusion 
that 
the 
souls, 
that 
is, 
the 
forms 
of 

organic 
bodies, 
must 
perish 
with 
the 
bodies, 
or 
at 
least 
this 
must 
happen 
to 
the 
passive 
understanding 
that 
belongs 
to 
each 
one 
individually. 
Thus 
there 
will 
only 
remain 
the 
active 
understanding 
common 
to 
all 
men, 
which 
according 
to 
Aristotle 
comes 
from 
outside, 
and 
which 
must 
work 
wheresoever 
the 
organs 
are 
suitably 
disposed; 
even 
as 
the 
wind 
produces 
a 
kindofmusicwhenitis 
blownintoproperlyadjustedorganpipes. 


8. 
Nothing 
could 
have 
been 
weaker 
than 
this 
would-be 
proof. 
It 
is 
not 
true 
that 
Aristotle 
refuted 
metempsychosis, 
or 
that 
he 
proved 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
human 
kind; 
and 
after 
all, 
it 
is 
quite 
untrue 
that 
an 
actual 
infinity 
is 
impossible. 
Yet 
this 
proof 
passed 
as 
irresistible 
amongst 
Aristotelians, 
and 
induced 
in 
them 
the 
belief 
that 
there 
was 
a 
certain 
sublunary 
intelligence 
and 
that 
our 
active 
intellect 
was 
produced 
by 
participation 
in 
it. 
But 
others 
who 
adhered 
less 
to 
Aristotle 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
advocate 
a 
universal 
soul 
forming 
the 
ocean 
of 
all 
individual 
souls, 
and 
believed 
this 
universal 
soul 
alone 
capable 
of 
subsisting, 
whilst 
individual 
souls 
are 
born 
and 
die. 
According 
to 
this 
opinion 
the 
souls 
of 
animals 
are 
born 
by 
being 
separated 
like 
drops 
from 
their 
ocean, 
when 
they 
find 
a 
body 
which 
they 
can 
animate; 
and 
they 
die 
by 
being 
reunited 
to 
the 
ocean 
of 
souls 
when 
the 
body 
is 
destroyed, 
as 
streams 
are 
lost 
in 
the 
sea. 
Many 
even 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
believe 
that 
God 
is 
that 
universal 
soul, 
although 
others 
thought 
that 
this 
soul 
was 
subordinate 
and 
created. 
This 
bad 
doctrine 
is 
very 
ancient 
and 
apt 
to 
dazzle 
the 
common 
herd.

Plato’s 
Soul 
of 
the 
World 
has 
been 
taken 
in 
this 
sense 
by 
some, 
but 
there 
is 
more 
indication 
that 
the 
Stoics 
succumbed 
to 
that 
universal 
soul 
which 
swallows 
all 
the 
rest. 
Those 
who 
are 
of 
this 
opinion 
might 
be 
called 
‘Monopsychites’,sinceaccordingto 
themthere 
isin 
realityonlyonesoul 
that 
subsists. 
M. 
Bernier 
observes 
that 
this 
is 
an 
opinion 
almost 
universally 
accepted 
amongst 
scholars 
in 
Persia 
and 
in 
the 
States 
of 
the 
Grand 
Mogul; 
it 
appears 
even 
that 
it 
has 
gained 
a 
footing 
with 
the 
Cabalists 
and 
with 
the 
mystics. 
A 
certain 
German 
of 
Swabian 
birth, 
converted 
to 
Judaism 
some 
years 
ago, 
who 
taught 
under 
the 
name 
Moses 
Germanus, 
having 
adopted 
the 
dogmas 
of 
Spinoza, 
believed 
that 
Spinoza 
revived 
the 
ancient 
Cabala 
of 
the 
Hebrews. 
And 
a 
learned 
man 
who 
confuted 
this 
proselyte 
Jew 
appears 
to 
be 
of 
the 
same 
opinion. 
It 
is 
known 
that 
Spinoza 
recognizes 
only 
substance 
in 
the 
world, 
whereof 
individual 
souls 
are 
but 
transient 
modifications. 
Valentin 
Weigel, 
Pastor 
of 
Zschopau 
in 
Saxony, 
a 
man 
of 
wit, 
even 
of 
excessive 
wit, 
although 
people 
would 
have 
it 
that 
he 
was 
a 
visionary, 
was 
perhaps 
to 
some 
extent 
of 
that 
opinion; 
as 
was 
also 
a 
man 
known 
as 
Johann 
Angelus 
Silesius, 
authorofcertainquitepleasing 
little 
devotionalversesinGerman,in 
the 
form 
of 
epigrams, 
which 
have 
just 
been 
reprinted. 
In 
general, 
the 
mystics’ 
doctrine 
of 
deification 
was 
liable 
to 
such 
a 
sinister 
interpretation.

But 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to 
write 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
has 
no 
need 
of 
excuses: 
although 
I 
confess 
that 
oft-times 

expressions 
which 
are 
extravagant, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
poetical, 
have 
greater 
force

10. 
The 
annihilation 
of 
all 
that 
belongs 
to 
us 
in 
our 
own 
right, 
carried 
to 
great 
lengths 
by 
the 
Quietists, 
might 
equally 
well 
be 
veiled 
irreligion 
in 
certain 
minds, 
as 
is 
related, 
for 
example, 
concerning 
the 
Quietism 
of 
Foë, 
originator 
of 
a 
great 
Chinese 
sect. 
After 
having 
preached 
his 
religion 
for 
forty 
years, 
when 
he 
felt 
death 
was 
approaching, 
he 
declared 
to 
his 
disciples 
that 
he 
had 
hidden 
the 
truth 
from 
them 
under 
the 
veil 
of 
metaphors, 
and 
that 
all 
reduced 
itself 
to 
Nothingness, 
which 
he 
said 
was 
the 
first 
source 
of 
all 
things. 
That 
was 
still 
worse, 
so 
it 
would 
seem, 
than 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
Averroists. 
Both 
of 
these 
doctrines 
are 
indefensible 
and 
even 
extravagant; 
nevertheless 
some 
moderns 
have 
made 
no 
difficulty 
about 
adopting 
this 
one 
and 
universal 
Soul 
that 
engulfs 
the 
rest. 
It 
has 
met 
with 
only 
too 
much 
applause 
amongst 
the 
so-called 
freethinkers, 
andM. 
dePreissac, 
a 
soldier 
and 
man 
of 
wit, 
who 
dabbled 
in 
philosophy, 
at 
one 
time 
aired 
it 
publicly 
in 
his 
discourses. 
The 
System 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
is 
the 
one 
best 
qualified 
to 
cure 
this 
evil. 
For 
it 
shows 
that 
there 
are 
of 
necessity 
substances 
which 
are 
simple 
and 
without 
extension, 
scattered 
throughout 
all 
Nature; 
that 
these 
substances 
must 
subsist 
independently 
of 
every 
other 
except 
God; 
and 
that 
they 
are 
never 
wholly 
separated 
from 
organic 
body. 
Those 
who 
believe 
that 
souls 
capable 
of 
feeling 
but 
incapable 
of 
reason 
are 
mortal, 
or 
who 
maintain 
that 
none 
but 
reasoning 
souls 
can 
have 
feeling, 
offer 
a 
handle 
to 
the 
Monopsychites. 
For 
it 
will 
ever 
be 
difficult 
to 
persuade 
men 
that 
beasts 
feel 
nothing; 
and 
once 
the 
admission 
has 
been 
made 
that 
that 
which 
is 
capable 
of 
feeling 
can 
die, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
found 
upon 
reason 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
immortality 
ofoursouls. 
11. 
I 
have 
made 
this 
short 
digression 
because 
it 
appeared 
to 
me 
seasonable 
at 
a 
time 
when 
there 
is 
only 
too 
much 
tendency 
to 
overthrow 
natural 
religion 

to 
its 
very 
foundations. 
I 
return 
then 
to 
the 
Averroists, 
who 
were 
persuaded 
that 
their 
dogma 
was 
proved 
conclusively 
in 
accordance 
with 
reason. 
As 
a 
result 
they 
declared 
that 
man’s 
soul 
is, 
according 
to 
philosophy, 
mortal, 
while 
they 
protested 
their 
acquiescence 
in 
Christian 
theology, 
which 
declares 
the 
soul’s 
immortality. 
But 
this 
distinction 
was 
held 
suspect, 
and 
this 
divorce 
between 
faith 
and 
reason 
was 
vehemently 
rejected 
by 
the 
prelates 
and 
the 
doctors 
of 
that 
time, 
and 
condemned 
in 
the 
last 
Lateran 
Council 
under 
Leo 
X. 
On 
that 
occasion 
also, 
scholars 
were 
urged 
to 
work 
for 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
difficulties 
that 
appeared 
to 
set 
theology 
and 
philosophy 
at 
variance. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
their 
incompatibility 
continued 
to 
hold 
its 
ground 
incognito. 
Pomponazzi 
was 
suspected 
of 
it, 
although 
he 
declared 
himself 
otherwise; 
and 
that 
very 
sect 
of 
the 
Averroists 
survived 
as 
a 
school. 
It 
is 
thought 
that 
Caesar 
Cremoninus, 
a 
philosopher 
famous 
in 
his 
time, 
was 
one 
of 
its 
mainstays. 
Andreas 
Cisalpinus, 
a 
physician 
(and 
an 
author 
of 
merit 
who 
came 
nearest 
after 
Michael 
Servetus 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
circulation 
of 
the 
blood), 
was 
accused 
by 
Nicolas 
Taurel 
(in 
a 
book 
entitled 
Alpes 
Caesae) 
of 
belonging 
to 
these 
anti-religious 
Peripatetics. 
Traces 
of 
this 
doctrine 
are 
found 
also 
in 
the 
Circulus 
Pisanus 
Claudii 
Berigardi, 
an 
author 
of 
French 
nationality 
who 
migrated 
to 
Italy 
and 
taught 
philosophy 
at 
Pisa: 
but 
especially 
the 
writings 
and 
the 
letters 
of 
Gabriel 
Naudé, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Naudaeana, 
show 
that 
Averroism 
still 
lived 
on 
when 
this 
learned 
physician 
was 
in 
Italy. 
Corpuscular 
philosophy, 
introduced 
shortly 
after, 
appears 
to 
have 
extinguished 
this 
excessively 
Peripatetic 
sect, 
or 
perhaps 
to 
have 
been 
intermixed 
with 
its 
teaching. 
It 
may 
be 
indeed 
that 
there 
have 
been 
Atomists 
who 
would 
be 
inclined 
to 
teach 
dogmas 
like 
those 
of 
the 
Averroists, 
if 
circumstances 
so 
permitted: 
but 
this 
abuse 
cannot 
harm 
such 
good 
as 
there 
is 
in 
Corpuscular 
philosophy, 
which 
can 
very 
well 
be 
combined 
with 
all 
that 
is 



sound 
in 
Plato 
and 
in 
Aristotle, 
and 
bring 
them 
both 
into 
harmony 
with 
true 
theology. 


12. 
The 
Reformers, 
and 
especially 
Luther, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
observed, 
spoke 
sometimes 
as 
if 
they 
rejected 
philosophy, 
and 
deemed 
it 
inimical 
to 
faith. 
But, 
properly 
speaking, 
Luther 
understood 
by 
philosophy 
only 
that 
which 
is 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
Nature, 
or 
perhaps 
even 
philosophy 
as 
it 
was 
taught 
in 
the 
schools. 
Thus 
for 
example 
he 
says 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
in 
philosophy, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
Nature, 
that 
the 
word 
be 
made 
flesh; 
and 
he 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
maintain 
that 
what 
is 
true 
in 
natural 
philosophy 
might 
be 
false 
in 
ethics. 
Aristotle 
was 
the 
object 
of 
his 
anger; 
and 
so 
far 
back 
as 
the 
year 
1516 
he 
contemplated 
the 
purging 
of 
philosophy, 
when 
he 
perhaps 
had 
as 
yet 
no 
thoughts 
of 
reforming 
the 
Church. 
But 
at 
last 
he 
curbed 
his 
vehemence 
and 
in 
the 
Apology 
for 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
allowed 
a 
favourable 
mention 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
his 
Ethics. 
Melanchthon, 
a 
man 
of 
sound 
and 
moderate 
ideas, 
made 
little 
systems 
from 
the 
several 
parts 
of 
philosophy, 
adapted 
to 
the 
truths 
of 
revelation 
and 
useful 
in 
civic 
life, 
which 
deserve 
tobereadeven 
now. 
Afterhim,Pierre 
delaRaméeenteredthe 
lists. 
His 
philosophy 
was 
much 
in 
favour: 
the 
sect 
of 
the 
Ramists 
was 
powerful 
in 
Germany, 
gaining 
many 
adherents 
among 
the 
Protestants, 
and 
even 
concerning 
itself 
with 
theology, 
until 
the 
revival 
of 
Corpuscular 
philosophy, 
which 
caused 
that 
of 
Ramée 
to 
fall 
into 
oblivion 
and 
weakened 
theauthorityof 
thePeripatetics. 
13. 
Meanwhile 
sundry 
Protestant 
theologians, 
deviating 
as 
far 
as 
they 
could 
from 
Scholastic 
philosophy, 
which 
prevailed 
in 
the 
opposite 
party, 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
despise 
philosophy 
itself, 
which 
to 
them 
was 
suspect. 
The 
controversy 
blazed 
up 
finally 
owing 
to 
the 
rancour 
of 
Daniel 
Hoffmann. 
He 
was 
an 
able 
theologian, 
who 
had 
previously 
gained 
a 
reputation 
at 
the 
Conference 
of 
Quedlinburg, 
when 
Tilemann 
Heshusius 
and 
he 
had 
supported 

Duke 
Julius 
of 
Brunswick 
in 
his 
refusal 
to 
accept 
the 
Formula 
of 
Concord. 
For 
some 
reason 
or 
other 
Dr. 
Hoffmann 
flew 
into 
a 
passion 
with 
philosophy, 
instead 
of 
being 
content 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
the 
wrong 
uses 
made 
thereof 
by 
philosophers. 
He 
was, 
however, 
aiming 
at 
the 
famous 
Caselius, 
a 
man 
esteemed 
by 
the 
princes 
and 
scholars 
of 
his 
time; 
and 
Henry 
Julius, 
Duke 
of 
Brunswick 
(son 
of 
Julius, 
founderof 
the 
University), 
having 
taken 
the 
trouble 
himself 
to 
investigate 
the 
matter, 
condemned 
the 
theologian. 
There 
have 
been 
some 
small 
disputes 
of 
the 
kind 
since, 
but 
it 
has 
always 
been 
found 
that 
they 
were 
misunderstandings. 
Paul 
Slevogt, 
a 
famous 
Professor 
at 
Jena 
in 
Thuringia, 
whose 
still 
extant 
treatises 
prove 
how 
well 
versed 
he 
was 
in 
Scholastic 
philosophy, 
as 
also 
in 
Hebrew 
literature, 
had 
published 
in 
his 
youth 
under 
the 
title 
of 
Pervigilium 
a 
little 
book 
‘de 
dissidio 
Theologi 
et 
Philosophi 
in 
utriusque 
principiis 
fundato’, 
bearing 
on 
the 
question 
whether 
God 
is 
accidentally 
the 
cause 
of 
sin. 
But 
it 
was 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
his 
aim 
was 
to 
demonstratethattheologianssometimesmisuse 
philosophicalterms. 


14. 
To 
come 
now 
to 
the 
events 
of 
my 
own 
time, 
I 
remember 
that 
when 
in 
1666 
Louis 
Meyer, 
a 
physician 
of 
Amsterdam, 
published 
anonymously 
the 
book 
entitled 
Philosophia 
Scripturae 
Interpres 
(by 
many 
persons 
wrongly 
attributed 
to 
Spinoza, 
his 
friend) 
the 
theologians 
of 
Holland 
bestirred 
themselves, 
and 
their 
written 
attacks 
upon 
this 
book 
gave 
rise 
to 
great 
disputes 
among 
them. 
Divers 
of 
them 
held 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
Cartesians, 
in 
confuting 
the 
anonymous 
philosopher, 
had 
conceded 
too 
much 
to 
philosophy. 
Jean 
de 
Labadie 
(before 
he 
had 
seceded 
from 
the 
Reformed 
Church, 
his 
pretext 
being 
some 
abuses 
which 
he 
said 
had 
crept 
into 
public 
observance 
and 
which 
he 
considered 
intolerable) 
attacked 
the 
book 
by 
Herr 
von 
Wollzogen, 
and 
called 
it 
pernicious. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
Herr 
Vogelsang, 
Herr 
van 
der 
Weye 
and 
some 
other 
anti-Cocceïans 
also 
assailed 
the 
same 
book 
with 
much 
acrimony. 
But 
the 
accused 
won 
his 
case 
in 
a 
Synod. 
Afterwards 
in 

Holland 
people 
spoke 
of 
‘rational’ 
and 
‘non-rational’ 
theologians, 
a 
party 
distinction 
often 
mentioned 
by 
M. 
Bayle, 
who 
finally 
declared 
himself 
against 
the 
former. 
But 
there 
is 
no 
indication 
that 
any 
precise 
rules 
have 
yet 
been 
defined 
which 
the 
rival 
parties 
accept 
or 
reject 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
use 
of 
reasonintheinterpretationofHolyScripture. 


15. 
A 
like 
dispute 
has 
threatened 
of 
late 
to 
disturb 
the 
peace 
in 
the 
Churches 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession. 
Some 
Masters 
of 
Arts 
in 
the 
University 
of 
Leipzig 
gave 
private 
lessons 
at 
their 
homes, 
to 
students 
who 
sought 
them 
out 
in 
order 
to 
learn 
what 
is 
called 
‘Sacra 
Philologia’, 
according 
to 
the 
practice 
of 
this 
university 
and 
of 
some 
others 
where 
this 
kind 
of 
study 
is 
not 
restricted 
to 
the 
Faculty 
of 
Theology. 
These 
masters 
pressed 
the 
study 
of 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures 
and 
the 
practice 
of 
piety 
further 
than 
their 
fellows 
had 
been 
wont 
to 
do. 
It 
is 
alleged 
that 
they 
had 
carried 
certain 
things 
to 
excess, 
and 
aroused 
suspicions 
of 
certain 
doctrinal 
innovations. 
This 
caused 
them 
to 
be 
dubbed 
‘Pietists’, 
as 
though 
they 
were 
a 
new 
sect; 
and 
this 
name 
is 
one 
which 
has 
since 
caused 
a 
great 
stir 
in 
Germany. 
It 
has 
been 
applied 
somehow 
or 
other 
to 
those 
whom 
one 
suspected, 
or 
pretended 
to 
suspect, 
of 
fanaticism, 
or 
even 
of 
hypocrisy, 
concealed 
under 
some 
semblance 
of 
reform. 
Now 
some 
of 
the 
students 
attending 
these 
masters 
had 
become 
conspicuous 
for 
behaviour 
which 
gave 
general 
offence, 
and 
amongst 
other 
things 
for 
their 
scorn 
of 
philosophy, 
even, 
so 
it 
was 
said, 
burning 
their 
notebooks. 
In 
consequence 
the 
belief 
arose 
that 
their 
masters 
rejected 
philosophy: 
but 
they 
justified 
themselves 
very 
well; 
nor 
could 
they 
be 
convicted 
either 
of 
this 
error 
orof 
the 
heresiesthatwerebeing 
imputedtothem. 
16. 
The 
question 
of 
the 
use 
of 
philosophy 
in 
theology 
was 
debated 
much 
amongst 
Christians, 
and 
difficulty 
was 
experienced 
over 
settling 
the 
limits 
of 
its 
use 
when 
it 
came 
to 
detailed 
consideration. 
The 
Mysteries 
of 
the 
Trinity, 
of 
the 
Incarnation 
and 
of 
the 
Holy 
Communion 
gave 
most 
occasion 
for 

dispute. 
The 
new 
Photinians, 
disputing 
the 
first 
two 
Mysteries, 
made 
use 
of 
certain 
philosophic 
maxims 
which 
Andreas 
Kessler, 
a 
theologian 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession, 
summarized 
in 
the 
various 
treatises 
that 
he 
published 
on 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
Socinian 
philosophy. 
But 
as 
to 
their 
metaphysics, 
one 
might 
instruct 
oneself 
better 
therein 
by 
reading 
the 
work 
of 
Christopher 
Stegmann 
the 
Socinian. 
It 
is 
not 
yet 
in 
print; 
but 
I 
saw 
it 
in 
my 
youth 
and 
it 
hasbeenrecently 
againinmyhands. 


17. 
Calovius 
and 
Scherzer, 
authors 
well 
versed 
in 
Scholastic 
philosophy, 
and 
sundry 
other 
able 
theologians 
answered 
the 
Socinians 
at 
great 
length, 
and 
often 
with 
success: 
for 
they 
would 
not 
content 
themselves 
with 
the 
general 
and 
somewhat 
cavalier 
answers 
that 
were 
commonly 
used 
against 
that 
sect. 
The 
drift 
of 
such 
answers 
was: 
that 
their 
maxims 
were 
good 
in 
philosophy 
and 
not 
in 
theology; 
that 
it 
was 
the 
fault 
of 
heterogeneousness 
called 
μεταβασις 
εις 
αλλο 
γενος 
to 
apply 
those 
maxims 
to 
a 
matter 
transcending 
reason; 
and 
that 
philosophy 
should 
be 
treated 
as 
a 
servant 
and 
not 
a 
mistress 
in 
relation 
to 
theology, 
according 
to 
the 
title 
of 
the 
book 
by 
a 
Scot 
named 
RobertBaronius, 
Philosophia 
Theologiae 
ancillans.In 
fine,philosophywas 
a 
Hagar 
beside 
Sara 
and 
must 
be 
driven 
from 
the 
house 
with 
her 
Ishmael 
when 
she 
was 
refractory. 
There 
is 
something 
good 
in 
these 
answers: 
but 
one 
might 
abuse 
them, 
and 
set 
natural 
truths 
and 
truths 
of 
revelation 
at 
variance. 
Scholars 
therefore 
applied 
themselves 
to 
distinguishing 
between 
what 
is 
necessary 
and 
indispensable 
in 
natural 
or 
philosophic 
truths 
and 
that 
which 
is 
notso. 
18. 
The 
two 
Protestant 
parties 
are 
tolerably 
in 
agreement 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
making 
war 
on 
the 
Socinians; 
and 
as 
the 
philosophy 
of 
these 
sectaries 
is 
not 
of 
the 
most 
exact, 
in 
most 
cases 
the 
attack 
succeeded 
in 
reducing 
it. 
But 
the 
Protestants 
themselves 
had 
dissensions 
on 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
Eucharistic 
Sacrament. 
A 
section 
of 
those 
who 
are 
called 
Reformed 

(namely 
those 
who 
on 
that 
point 
follow 
rather 
Zwingli 
than 
Calvin) 
seemed 
to 
reduce 
the 
participation 
in 
the 
body 
of 
Jesus 
Christ 
in 
the 
Holy 
Communion 
to 
a 
mere 
figurative 
representation, 
employing 
the 
maxim 
of 
the 
philosophers 
which 
states 
that 
a 
body 
can 
only 
be 
in 
one 
place 
at 
a 
time. 
Contrariwise 
the 
Evangelicals 
(who 
name 
themselves 
thus 
in 
a 
particular 
sense 
to 
distinguish 
themselves 
from 
the 
Reformed), 
being 
more 
attached 
to 
the 
literal 
sense 
of 
Scripture, 
opined 
with 
Luther 
that 
this 
participation 
was 
real, 
and 
that 
here 
there 
lay 
a 
supernatural 
Mystery. 
They 
reject, 
in 
truth, 
the 
dogma 
of 
Transubstantiation, 
which 
they 
believe 
to 
be 
without 
foundation 
in 
the 
Text; 
neither 
do 
they 
approve 
that 
of 
Consubstantiation 
or 
of 
Impanation, 
which 
one 
could 
only 
impute 
to 
them 
if 
one 
were 
ill-informed 
on 
their 
opinion. 
For 
they 
admit 
no 
inclusion 
of 
the 
body 
of 
Jesus 
Christ 
in 
the 
bread, 
nor 
do 
they 
even 
require 
any 
union 
of 
the 
one 
with 
the 
other: 
but 
they 
demand 
at 
least 
a 
concomitance, 
so 
that 
these 
two 
substances 
be 
received 
both 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
They 
believe 
that 
the 
ordinary 
sense 
of 
the 
words 
of 
Jesus 
Christ 
on 
an 
occasion 
so 
important 
as 
that 
which 
concerned 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
last 
wishes 
ought 
to 
be 
preserved. 
Thus 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
this 
sense 
is 
free 
from 
all 
absurdity 
which 
could 
make 
it 
repugnant 
to 
us, 
they 
maintain 
that 
the 
philosophic 
maxim 
restricting 
the 
existence 
of, 
and 
partaking 
in, 
bodies 
to 
one 
place 
alone 
is 
simply 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
Nature. 
They 
make 
that 
no 
obstacle 
to 
the 
presence, 
in 
the 
ordinary 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
of 
the 
body 
of 
our 
Saviour 
in 
such 
form 
as 
may 
be 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
most 
glorified 
body. 
They 
do 
not 
resort 
to 
a 
vague 
diffusion 
of 
ubiquity, 
which 
would 
disperse 
the 
body 
and 
leave 
it 
nowhere 
in 
particular; 
nor 
do 
they 
admit 
the 
multiple-reduplication 
theory 
of 
some 
Schoolmen, 
as 
if 
to 
say 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body 
could 
be 
at 
the 
same 
time 
seated 
here 
and 
standing 
elsewhere. 
In 
fine, 
they 
so 
express 
themselves 
that 
many 
consider 
the 
opinion 
of 
Calvin, 
authorized 
by 
sundry 
confessions 
of 



faith 
from 
the 
Churches 
that 
have 
accepted 
his 
teaching, 
to 
be 
not 
so 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
as 
one 
might 
think: 
for 
he 
affirmed 
a 
partaking 
in 
the 
substance. 
The 
divergence 
rests 
perhaps 
only 
upon 
the 
fact 
that 
Calvin 
demands 
true 
faith 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
oral 
reception 
of 
the 
symbols,andconsequentlyexcludestheunworthy. 


19. 
Thence 
we 
see 
that 
the 
dogma 
of 
real 
and 
substantial 
participation 
can 
be 
supported 
(without 
resorting 
to 
the 
strange 
opinions 
of 
some 
Schoolmen) 
by 
a 
properly 
understood 
analogy 
between 
immediate 
operation 
and 
presence. 
Many 
philosophers 
have 
deemed 
that, 
even 
in 
the 
order 
of 
Nature, 
a 
body 
may 
operate 
from 
a 
distance 
immediately 
on 
many 
remote 
bodies 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
So 
do 
they 
believe, 
all 
the 
more, 
that 
nothing 
can 
prevent 
divine 
Omnipotence 
from 
causing 
one 
body 
to 
be 
present 
in 
many 
bodies 
together, 
since 
the 
transition 
from 
immediate 
operation 
to 
presence 
is 
but 
slight, 
the 
one 
perhaps 
depending 
upon 
the 
other. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
modern 
philosophers 
for 
some 
time 
now 
have 
denied 
the 
immediate 
natural 
operation 
of 
one 
body 
upon 
another 
remote 
from 
it, 
and 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
am 
of 
their 
opinion. 
Meanwhile 
remote 
operation 
has 
just 
been 
revived 
in 
England 
by 
the 
admirable 
Mr. 
Newton, 
who 
maintains 
that 
it 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
bodies 
to 
be 
attracted 
and 
gravitate 
one 
towards 
another, 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
mass 
of 
each 
one, 
and 
the 
rays 
of 
attraction 
it 
receives. 
Accordingly 
the 
famous 
Mr. 
Locke, 
in 
his 
answer 
to 
Bishop 
Stillingfleet, 
declares 
that 
having 
seen 
Mr. 
Newton’s 
book 
he 
retracts 
what 
he 
himself 
said, 
following 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
moderns, 
in 
his 
Essay 
concerning 
Human 
Understanding, 
to 
wit, 
that 
a 
body 
cannot 
operate 
immediately 
upon 
another 
except 
by 
touching 
it 
upon 
its 
surface 
and 
driving 
it 
by 
its 
motion. 
He 
acknowledges 
that 
God 
can 
put 
properties 
into 
matter 
which 
cause 
it 
to 
operate 
from 
a 
distance. 
Thus 
the 
theologians 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
claim 
that 
God 
may 
ordain 
not 
only 
that 
a 
body 
operate 
immediately 
on 
divers 
bodies 
remote 
from 
one 
another, 
but 
that 
it 
even 
exist 

in 
their 
neighbourhood 
and 
be 
received 
by 
them 
in 
a 
way 
with 
which 
distances 
of 
place 
and 
dimensions 
of 
space 
have 
nothing 
to 
do. 
Although 
this 
effect 
transcends 
the 
forces 
of 
Nature, 
they 
do 
not 
think 
it 
possible 
to 
show 
that 
itsurpassesthepoweroftheAuthorofNature. 
Forhim 
itis 
easytoannul 
the 
laws 
that 
he 
has 
given 
or 
to 
dispense 
with 
them 
as 
seems 
good 
to 
him, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
he 
was 
able 
to 
make 
iron 
float 
upon 
water 
and 
to 
stay 
the 
operationoffireuponthehuman 
body. 


20. 
I 
found 
in 
comparing 
the 
Rationale 
Theologicum 
of 
Nicolaus 
Vedelius 
with 
the 
refutation 
by 
Johann 
Musaeus 
that 
these 
two 
authors, 
of 
whom 
one 
died 
while 
a 
Professor 
at 
Franecker 
after 
having 
taught 
at 
Geneva 
and 
the 
other 
finally 
became 
the 
foremost 
theologian 
at 
Jena, 
are 
more 
or 
less 
in 
agreement 
on 
the 
principal 
rules 
for 
the 
use 
of 
reason, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
in 
the 
application 
of 
these 
rules 
they 
disagree. 
For 
they 
both 
agree 
that 
revelation 
cannot 
be 
contrary 
to 
the 
truths 
whose 
necessity 
is 
called 
by 
philosophers 
‘logical’ 
or 
‘metaphysical’, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
whose 
opposite 
implies 
contradiction. 
They 
both 
admit 
also 
that 
revelation 
will 
be 
able 
to 
combat 
maxims 
whose 
necessity 
is 
called 
‘physical’ 
and 
is 
founded 
only 
upon 
the 
laws 
that 
the 
will 
of 
God 
has 
prescribed 
for 
Nature. 
Thus 
the 
question 
whether 
the 
presence 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
body 
in 
divers 
places 
is 
possible 
in 
the 
supernatural 
order 
only 
touches 
the 
application 
of 
the 
rule; 
and 
in 
order 
to 
decide 
this 
question 
conclusively 
by 
reason, 
one 
must 
needs 
explain 
exactly 
wherein 
the 
essence 
of 
body 
consists. 
Even 
the 
Reformed 
disagree 
thereon 
amongst 
themselves; 
the 
Cartesians 
confine 
it 
to 
extension, 
but 
their 
adversaries 
oppose 
that; 
and 
I 
think 
I 
have 
even 
observed 
that 
Gisbertus 
Voëtius,afamous 
theologianofUtrecht,doubtedtheallegedimpossibilityof 
pluralityoflocations. 
21. 
Furthermore, 
although 
the 
two 
Protestant 
parties 
agree 
that 
one 
must 
distinguish 
these 
two 
necessities 
which 
I 
have 
just 
indicated, 
namely 

metaphysical 
necessity 
and 
physical 
necessity, 
and 
that 
the 
first 
excludes 
exceptions 
even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Mysteries, 
they 
are 
not 
yet 
sufficiently 
agreed 
upon 
the 
rules 
of 
interpretation, 
which 
serve 
to 
determine 
in 
what 
cases 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
desert 
the 
letter 
of 
Scripture 
when 
one 
is 
not 
certain 
that 
it 
is 
contrary 
to 
strictly 
universal 
truths. 
It 
is 
agreed 
that 
there 
are 
cases 
where 
one 
must 
reject 
a 
literal 
interpretation 
that 
is 
not 
absolutely 
impossible, 
when 
it 
is 
otherwise 
unsuitable. 
For 
instance, 
all 
commentators 
agree 
that 
when 
our 
Lord 
said 
that 
Herod 
was 
a 
fox 
he 
meant 
it 
metaphorically; 
and 
one 
must 
accept 
that, 
unless 
one 
imagine 
with 
some 
fanatics 
that 
for 
the 
time 
the 
words 
of 
our 
Lord 
lasted 
Herod 
was 
actually 
changed 
into 
a 
fox. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
samewiththetextson 
whichMysteriesarefounded,where 
the 
theologiansof 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
deem 
that 
one 
must 
keep 
to 
the 
literal 
sense. 
Since, 
moreover, 
this 
discussion 
belongs 
to 
the 
art 
of 
interpretation 
and 
not 
to 
that 
which 
is 
the 
proper 
sphere 
of 
logic, 
we 
will 
not 
here 
enter 
thereon, 
especially 
as 
it 
has 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
the 
disputes 
that 
have 
arisen 
recently 
upon 
theconformityof 
faithwithreason. 


22. 
Theologians 
of 
all 
parties, 
I 
believe 
(fanatics 
alone 
excepted), 
agree 
at 
least 
that 
no 
article 
of 
faith 
must 
imply 
contradiction 
or 
contravene 
proofs 
as 
exact 
as 
those 
of 
mathematics, 
where 
the 
opposite 
of 
the 
conclusion 
can 
be 
reduced 
ad 
absurdum, 
that 
is, 
to 
contradiction. 
St. 
Athanasius 
with 
good 
reason 
made 
sport 
of 
the 
preposterous 
ideas 
of 
some 
writers 
of 
his 
time, 
who 
maintained 
that 
God 
had 
suffered 
without 
any 
suffering. 
‘Passus 
est 
impassibiliter. 
O 
ludicram 
doctrinam 
aedificantem 
simul 
et 
demolientem!’ 
It 
follows 
thence 
that 
certain 
writers 
have 
been 
too 
ready 
to 
grant 
that 
the 
Holy 
Trinity 
is 
contrary 
to 
that 
great 
principle 
which 
states 
that 
two 
things 
which 
are 
the 
same 
as 
a 
third 
are 
also 
the 
same 
as 
each 
other: 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
if 
A 
is 
the 
same 
as 
B, 
and 
if 
C 
is 
the 
same 
as 
B, 
then 
A 
and 
C 
must 
also 
be 
the 
same 
as 
each 
other. 
For 
this 
principle 
is 
a 
direct 
consequence 
of 
that 
of 

contradiction, 
and 
forms 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
logic; 
and 
if 
it 
ceases, 
we 
can 
no 
longer 
reason 
with 
certainty. 
Thus 
when 
one 
says 
that 
the 
Father 
is 
God, 
that 
the 
Son 
is 
God 
and 
that 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
is 
God, 
and 
that 
nevertheless 
there 
is 
only 
one 
God, 
although 
these 
three 
Persons 
differ 
from 
one 
another, 
one 
must 
consider 
that 
this 
word 
God 
has 
not 
the 
same 
sense 
at 
the 
beginning 
as 
at 
the 
end 
of 
this 
statement. 
Indeed 
it 
signifies 
now 
the 
Divine 
Substance 
and 
now 
a 
Person 
of 
the 
Godhead. 
In 
general, 
one 
must 
take 
care 
never 
to 
abandon 
the 
necessary 
and 
eternal 
truths 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
upholding 
Mysteries, 
lest 
the 
enemies 
of 
religion 
seize 
upon 
such 
an 
occasion 
for 
decrying 
both 
religion 
and 
Mysteries. 


23. 
The 
distinction 
which 
is 
generally 
drawn 
between 
that 
which 
is 
above 
reason 
and 
that 
which 
is 
against 
reason 
is 
tolerably 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
distinction 
which 
has 
just 
been 
made 
between 
the 
two 
kinds 
of 
necessity. 
For 
what 
is 
contrary 
to 
reason 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
absolutely 
certain 
and 
inevitable 
truths; 
and 
what 
is 
above 
reason 
is 
in 
opposition 
only 
to 
what 
one 
is 
wont 
to 
experience 
or 
to 
understand. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
am 
surprised 
that 
there 
are 
people 
of 
intelligence 
who 
dispute 
this 
distinction, 
and 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
should 
be 
of 
this 
number. 
The 
distinction 
is 
assuredly 
very 
well 
founded. 
A 
truth 
is 
above 
reason 
when 
our 
mind 
(or 
even 
every 
created 
mind) 
cannot 
comprehend 
it. 
Such 
is, 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
the 
Holy 
Trinity; 
such 
are 
the 
miracles 
reserved 
for 
God 
alone, 
as 
for 
instance 
Creation; 
such 
is 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
order 
of 
the 
universe, 
which 
depends 
upon 
universal 
harmony, 
and 
upon 
the 
clear 
knowledge 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
things 
at 
once. 
But 
a 
truth 
can 
never 
be 
contrary 
to 
reason, 
and 
once 
a 
dogma 
has 
been 
disputed 
and 
refuted 
by 
reason, 
instead 
of 
its 
being 
incomprehensible, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
nothing 
is 
easier 
to 
understand, 
nor 
more 
obvious, 
than 
its 
absurdity. 
For 
I 
observed 
at 
the 
beginning 
that 
by 
reason 
here 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
the 
opinions 
and 
discourses 
of 

men, 
nor 
even 
the 
habit 
they 
have 
formed 
of 
judging 
things 
according 
to 
the 
usualcourseofNature,butrather 
the 
inviolablelinking 
togetherof 
truths. 


24. 
I 
must 
come 
now 
to 
the 
great 
question 
which 
M. 
Bayle 
brought 
up 
recently, 
to 
wit, 
whether 
a 
truth, 
and 
especially 
a 
truth 
of 
faith, 
can 
prove 
to 
be 
subject 
to 
irrefutable 
objections. 
This 
excellent 
author 
appears 
to 
answer 
with 
a 
bold 
affirmative: 
he 
quotes 
theologians 
of 
repute 
in 
his 
party, 
and 
even 
in 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome, 
who 
appear 
to 
say 
the 
same 
as 
he 
affirms; 
and 
he 
cites 
philosophers 
who 
have 
believed 
that 
there 
are 
even 
philosophical 
truths 
whose 
champions 
cannot 
answer 
the 
objections 
that 
are 
brought 
up 
against 
them. 
He 
believes 
that 
the 
theological 
doctrine 
of 
predestination 
is 
of 
this 
nature, 
and 
in 
philosophy 
that 
of 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Continuum. 
These 
are, 
indeed, 
the 
two 
labyrinths 
which 
have 
ever 
exercised 
theologians 
and 
philosophers. 
Libertus 
Fromondus, 
a 
theologian 
of 
Louvain 
(a 
great 
friend 
of 
Jansenius, 
whose 
posthumous 
book 
entitled 
Augustinus 
he 
in 
fact 
published), 
who 
also 
wrote 
a 
book 
entitled 
explicitly 
Labyrinthus 
de 
Compositione 
Continui, 
experienced 
in 
full 
measure 
the 
difficulties 
inherent 
in 
both 
doctrines; 
and 
the 
renowned 
Ochino 
admirably 
presented 
what 
he 
calls 
‘the 
labyrinthsofpredestination’. 
25. 
But 
these 
writers 
have 
not 
denied 
the 
possibility 
of 
finding 
thread 
in 
the 
labyrinth; 
they 
have 
recognized 
the 
difficulty, 
but 
they 
have 
surely 
not 
turned 
difficulty 
into 
sheer 
impossibility. 
As 
for 
me, 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
cannot 
agreewith 
those 
who 
maintainthat 
a 
truth 
can 
admit 
of 
irrefutable 
objections: 
for 
is 
an 
objection 
anything 
but 
an 
argument 
whose 
conclusion 
contradicts 
our 
thesis? 
And 
is 
not 
an 
irrefutable 
argumenta 
demonstration? 
And 
how 
can 
one 
know 
the 
certainty 
of 
demonstrations 
except 
by 
examining 
the 
argument 
in 
detail, 
the 
form 
and 
the 
matter, 
in 
order 
to 
see 
if 
the 
form 
is 
good, 
and 
then 
if 
each 
premiss 
is 
either 
admitted 
or 
proved 
by 
another 
argument 
of 
like 
force, 
until 
one 
is 
able 
to 
make 
do 
with 
admitted 
premisses 
alone? 
Now 
if 

there 
is 
such 
an 
objection 
against 
our 
thesis 
we 
must 
say 
that 
the 
falsity 
of 
this 
thesis 
is 
demonstrated, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
have 
reasons 
sufficient 
to 
prove 
it; 
otherwise 
two 
contradictories 
would 
be 
true 
at 
once. 
One 
must 
always 
yield 
to 
proofs, 
whether 
they 
be 
proposed 
in 
positive 
form 
or 
advanced 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
objections. 
And 
it 
is 
wrong 
and 
fruitless 
to 
try 
to 
weaken 
opponents’ 
proofs, 
under 
the 
pretext 
that 
they 
are 
only 
objections, 
since 
the 
opponent 
can 
play 
the 
same 
game 
and 
can 
reverse 
the 
denominations, 
exalting 
his 
arguments 
by 
naming 
them 
‘proofs’ 
and 
sinking 
oursundertheblighting 
titleof 
‘objections’. 


26. 
It 
is 
another 
question 
whether 
we 
are 
always 
obliged 
to 
examine 
the 
objections 
we 
may 
have 
to 
face, 
and 
to 
retain 
some 
doubt 
in 
respect 
of 
our 
own 
opinion, 
or 
what 
is 
called 
formido 
oppositi, 
until 
this 
examination 
has 
been 
made. 
I 
would 
venture 
to 
say 
no, 
for 
otherwise 
one 
would 
never 
attain 
to 
certainty 
and 
our 
conclusion 
would 
be 
always 
provisional. 
I 
believe 
that 
able 
geometricians 
will 
scarce 
be 
troubled 
by 
the 
objections 
of 
Joseph 
Scaliger 
against 
Archimedes, 
or 
by 
those 
of 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
against 
Euclid; 
but 
that 
is 
because 
they 
have 
fully 
understood 
and 
are 
sure 
of 
the 
proofs. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
sometimes 
well 
to 
show 
oneself 
ready 
to 
examine 
certain 
objections. 
On 
the 
one 
hand 
it 
may 
serve 
to 
rescue 
people 
from 
their 
error, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
we 
ourselves 
may 
profit 
by 
it; 
for 
specious 
fallacies 
often 
contain 
some 
useful 
solution 
and 
bring 
about 
the 
removal 
of 
considerable 
difficulties. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
have 
always 
liked 
ingenious 
objections 
made 
against 
my 
own 
opinions, 
and 
I 
have 
never 
examined 
them 
without 
profit: 
witness 
those 
which 
M. 
Bayle 
formerly 
made 
against 
my 
System 
of 
Preestablished 
Harmony, 
not 
to 
mention 
those 
which 
M. 
Arnauld, 
M. 
l’Abbé 
Foucher 
and 
Father 
Lami, 
O.S.B. 
made 
to 
me 
on 
the 
same 
subject. 
But 
to 
return 
to 
the 
principal 
question, 
I 
conclude 
from 
reasons 
I 
have 
just 
set 
forth 

that 
when 
an 
objection 
is 
put 
forward 
against 
some 
truth, 
it 
is 
always 
possible 
toanswer 
itsatisfactorily. 


27. 
It 
may 
be 
also 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
does 
not 
mean 
‘insoluble 
objections’ 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
I 
have 
just 
explained. 
I 
observe 
that 
he 
varies, 
at 
least 
in 
his 
expressions: 
for 
in 
his 
posthumous 
Reply 
to 
M. 
le 
Clerc 
he 
does 
not 
admit 
that 
one 
can 
bring 
demonstrations 
against 
the 
truths 
of 
faith. 
It 
appears 
therefore 
that 
he 
takes 
the 
objections 
to 
be 
insoluble 
only 
in 
respect 
of 
our 
present 
degree 
of 
enlightenment; 
and 
in 
this 
Reply,, 
he 
even 
does 
not 
despair 
of 
the 
possibility 
that 
one 
day 
a 
solution 
hitherto 
unknown 
may 
be 
found 
by 
someone. 
Concerning 
that 
more 
will 
be 
said 
later. 
I 
hold 
an 
opinion, 
however, 
that 
will 
perchance 
cause 
surprise, 
namely 
that 
this 
solution 
has 
been 
discovered 
entire, 
and 
is 
not 
even 
particularly 
difficult. 
Indeed 
a 
mediocre 
intelligence 
capable 
of 
sufficient 
care, 
and 
using 
correctly 
the 
rules 
of 
common 
logic, 
is 
in 
a 
position 
to 
answer 
the 
most 
embarrassing 
objection 
made 
against 
truth, 
when 
the 
objection 
is 
only 
taken 
from 
reason, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
claimed 
to 
be 
a 
‘demonstration’. 
Whatever 
scorn 
the 
generality 
of 
moderns 
have 
to-day 
for 
the 
logic 
of 
Aristotle, 
one 
must 
acknowledge 
that 
it 
teaches 
infallible 
ways 
of 
resisting 
error 
in 
these 
conjunctures. 
For 
one 
has 
only 
to 
examine 
the 
argument 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
and 
it 
will 
always 
be 
possible 
to 
see 
whether 
it 
is 
lacking 
in 
form 
or 
whether 
there 
are 
premisses 
such 
as 
are 
notyetprovedbyagoodargument. 
28. 
Itis 
quite 
another 
matterwhenthereisonlyaquestionof 
probabilities, 
for 
the 
art 
of 
judging 
from 
probable 
reasons 
is 
not 
yet 
well 
established; 
so 
that 
our 
logic 
in 
this 
connexion 
is 
still 
very 
imperfect, 
and 
to 
this 
very 
day 
we 
have 
little 
beyond 
the 
art 
of 
judging 
from 
demonstrations. 
But 
this 
art 
is 
sufficient 
here: 
for 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
opposing 
reason 
to 
an 
article 
of 
our 
faith, 
one 
is 
not 
disturbed 
by 
objections 
that 
only 
attain 
probability. 
Everyone 
agrees 
that 
appearances 
are 
against 
Mysteries, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
by 

no 
means 
probable 
when 
regarded 
only 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
reason; 
but 
it 
suffices 
that 
they 
have 
in 
them 
nothing 
of 
absurdity. 
Thus 
demonstrations 
are 
required 
iftheyareto 
berefuted. 


29. 
And 
doubtless 
we 
are 
so 
to 
understand 
it 
when 
Holy 
Scripture 
warns 
us 
that 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
is 
foolishness 
before 
men, 
and 
when 
St. 
Paul 
observed 
that 
the 
Gospel 
of 
Jesus 
Christ 
is 
foolishness 
unto 
the 
Greeks, 
as 
well 
as 
unto 
the 
Jews 
a 
stumbling-block. 
For, 
after 
all, 
one 
truth 
cannot 
contradict 
another, 
and 
the 
light 
of 
reason 
is 
no 
less 
a 
gift 
of 
God 
than 
that 
of 
revelation. 
Also 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
no 
difficulty 
among 
theologians 
who 
are 
expert 
in 
their 
profession, 
that 
the 
motives 
of 
credibility 
justify, 
once 
for 
all, 
the 
authority 
of 
Holy 
Scripture 
before 
the 
tribunal 
of 
reason, 
so 
that 
reason 
in 
consequence 
gives 
way 
before 
it, 
as 
before 
a 
new 
light, 
and 
sacrifices 
thereto 
all 
its 
probabilities. 
It 
is 
more 
or 
less 
as 
if 
a 
new 
president 
sent 
by 
the 
prince 
must 
show 
his 
letters 
patent 
in 
the 
assembly 
where 
he 
is 
afterwards 
to 
preside. 
That 
is 
the 
tendency 
of 
sundry 
good 
books 
that 
we 
have 
on 
the 
truth 
ofreligion,suchasthoseofAugustinusSteuchus,ofDuPlessis-Mornayorof 
Grotius: 
for 
the 
true 
religion 
must 
needs 
have 
marks 
that 
the 
false 
religions 
have 
not, 
else 
would 
Zoroaster, 
Brahma, 
Somonacodom 
and 
Mahomet 
be 
as 
worthy 
of 
belief 
as 
Moses 
and 
Jesus 
Christ. 
Nevertheless 
divine 
faith 
itself, 
when 
it 
is 
kindled 
in 
the 
soul, 
is 
something 
more 
than 
an 
opinion, 
and 
depends 
not 
upon 
the 
occasions 
or 
the 
motives 
that 
have 
given 
it 
birth; 
it 
advances 
beyond 
the 
intellect, 
and 
takes 
possession 
of 
the 
will 
and 
of 
the 
heart, 
to 
make 
us 
act 
with 
zeal 
and 
joyfully 
as 
the 
law 
of 
God 
commands. 
Then 
we 
have 
no 
further 
need 
to 
think 
of 
reasons 
or 
to 
pause 
over 
the 
difficultiesof 
argumentwhichthemindmayanticipate. 
30. 
Thus 
what 
we 
have 
just 
said 
of 
human 
reason, 
which 
is 
extolled 
and 
decried 
by 
turns, 
and 
often 
without 
rule 
or 
measure, 
may 
show 
our 
lack 
of 
exactitude 
and 
how 
much 
we 
are 
accessary 
to 
our 
own 
errors. 
Nothing 
would 

be 
so 
easy 
to 
terminate 
as 
these 
disputes 
on 
the 
rights 
of 
faith 
and 
of 
reason 
if 
men 
would 
make 
use 
of 
the 
commonest 
rules 
of 
logic 
and 
reason 
with 
even 
a 
modicum 
of 
attention. 
Instead 
of 
that, 
they 
become 
involved 
in 
oblique 
and 
ambiguous 
phrases, 
which 
give 
them 
a 
fine 
field 
for 
declamation, 
to 
make 
the 
most 
of 
their 
wit 
and 
their 
learning. 
It 
would 
seem, 
indeed, 
that 
they 
have 
no 
wish 
to 
see 
the 
naked 
truth, 
peradventure 
because 
they 
fear 
that 
it 
may 
be 
more 
disagreeable 
than 
error: 
for 
they 
know 
not 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
Author 
of 
allthings,who 
isthesourceof 
truth. 


31. 
This 
negligence 
is 
a 
general 
defect 
of 
humanity, 
and 
one 
not 
to 
be 
laid 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
any 
particular 
person. 
Abundamus 
dulcibus 
vitiis, 
as 
Quintilian 
said 
of 
the 
style 
of 
Seneca, 
and 
we 
take 
pleasure 
in 
going 
astray. 
Exactitude 
incommodes 
us 
and 
rules 
we 
regard 
as 
puerilities. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
common 
logic 
(although 
it 
is 
more 
or 
less 
sufficient 
for 
the 
examination 
of 
arguments 
thattendtowards 
certainty) 
isrelegated 
to 
schoolboys; 
and 
there 
is 
not 
even 
a 
thought 
for 
a 
kind 
of 
logic 
which 
should 
determine 
the 
balance 
between 
probabilities, 
and 
would 
be 
so 
necessary 
in 
deliberations 
of 
importance. 
So 
true 
is 
it 
that 
our 
mistakes 
for 
the 
most 
part 
come 
from 
scorn 
or 
lack 
of 
the 
art 
of 
thinking: 
for 
nothing 
is 
more 
imperfect 
than 
our 
logic 
when 
we 
pass 
beyond 
necessary 
arguments. 
The 
most 
excellent 
philosophers 
of 
our 
time, 
such 
as 
the 
authors 
of 
The 
Art 
of 
Thinking, 
of 
The 
Search 
for 
Truth 
and 
ofthe 
Essay 
concerning 
Human 
Understanding, 
havebeenveryfar 
fromindicatingtousthe

it

in

is 
still 
more 
difficult 
of

and

very 
imperfect

in 
mathematics. 
32. 
One 
thing 
which 
might 
have 
contributed 
most 
towards 
M. 
Bayle’s 
belief 
that 
the 
difficulties 
of 
reason 
in 
opposition 
to 
faith 
cannot 
be 
obviated 

is 
that 
he 
seems 
to 
demand 
that 
God 
be 
justified 
in 
some 
such 
manner 
as 
that 
commonly 
used 
for 
pleading 
the 
cause 
of 
a 
man 
accused 
before 
his 
judge. 
But 
he 
has 
not 
remembered 
that 
in 
the 
tribunals 
of 
men, 
which 
cannot 
always 
penetrate 
to 
the 
truth, 
one 
is 
often 
compelled 
to 
be 
guided 
by 
signs 
and 
probabilities, 
and 
above 
all 
by 
presumptions 
or 
prejudices; 
whereas 
it 
is 
agreed, 
as 
we 
have 
already 
observed, 
that 
Mysteries 
are 
not 
probable. 
For 
instance,M. 
Baylewill 
not 
haveitthatone 
canjustifythe 
goodnessof 
Godin 
the 
permission 
of 
sin, 
because 
probability 
would 
be 
against 
a 
man 
that 
should 
happen 
to 
be 
in 
circumstances 
comparable 
in 
our 
eyes 
to 
this 
permission. 
God 
foresees 
that 
Eve 
will 
be 
deceived 
by 
the 
serpent 
if 
he 
places 
her 
in 
the 
circumstances 
wherein 
she 
later 
found 
herself; 
and 
nevertheless 
he 
placed 
her 
there. 
Now 
if 
a 
father 
or 
a 
guardian 
did 
the 
same 
in 
regard 
to 
his 
child 
or 
his 
ward, 
if 
a 
friend 
did 
so 
in 
regard 
to 
a 
young 
person 
whose 
behaviour 
was 
his 
concern, 
the 
judge 
would 
not 
be 
satisfied 
by 
the 
excuses 
of 
an 
advocate 
who 
said 
that 
the 
man 
only 
permitted 
the 
evil, 
without 
doing 
it 
or 
willing 
it: 
he 
would 
rather 
take 
this 
permission 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
ill 
intention, 
and 
would 
regard 
it 
as 
a 
sin 
of 
omission, 
which 
would 
render 
the 
one 
convicted 
thereof 
accessaryinanother’s 
sin 
ofcommission. 


33. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
when 
one 
has 
foreseen 
the 
evil 
and 
has 
not 
prevented 
it 
although 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
one 
could 
have 
done 
so 
with 
ease, 
and 
one 
has 
even 
done 
things 
that 
have 
facilitated 
it, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
on 
that 
account 
necessarily 
that 
one 
is 
accessary 
thereto. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
very 
strong 
presumption, 
such 
as 
commonly 
replaces 
truth 
in 
human 
affairs, 
but 
which 
would 
be 
destroyedby 
an 
exactconsideration 
of 
the 
facts,supposing 
we 
were 
capable 
of 
that 
in 
relation 
to 
God. 
For 
amongst 
lawyers 
that 
is 
called 
‘presumption’ 
which 
must 
provisionally 
pass 
for 
truth 
in 
case 
the 
contrary 
is 
not 
proved; 
and 
it 
says 
more 
than 
‘conjecture’, 
although 
the 
Dictionary 
ofthe 
Academy 
has 
not 
sifted 
the 
difference. 
Now 
there 
is 
every 
reason 
to 
conclude 

unquestionably 
that 
one 
would 
find 
through 
this 
consideration, 
if 
only 
it 
were 
attainable, 
that 
reasons 
most 
just, 
and 
stronger 
than 
those 
which 
appear 
contrary 
to 
them, 
have 
compelled 
the 
All-Wise 
to 
permit 
the 
evil, 
and 
even 
to 
dothingswhich 
havefacilitatedit. 
Ofthissomeinstanceswillbegivenlater. 


34. 
It 
is 
none 
too 
easy, 
I 
confess, 
for 
a 
father, 
a 
guardian, 
a 
friend 
to 
have 
such 
reasons 
in 
the 
case 
under 
consideration. 
Yet 
the 
thing 
is 
not 
absolutely 
impossible, 
and 
a 
skilled 
writer 
of 
fiction 
might 
perchance 
find 
an 
extraordinary 
case 
that 
would 
even 
justify 
a 
man 
in 
the 
circumstances 
I 
have 
just 
indicated. 
But 
in 
reference 
to 
God 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
suppose 
or 
to 
establish 
particular 
reasons 
such 
as 
may 
have 
induced 
him 
to 
permit 
the 
evil; 
general 
reasons 
suffice. 
One 
knows 
that 
he 
takes 
care 
of 
the 
whole 
universe, 
whereof 
all 
the 
parts 
are 
connected; 
and 
one 
must 
thence 
infer 
that 
he 
has 
had 
innumerable 
considerations 
whose 
result 
made 
him 
deem 
it 
inadvisable 
to 
preventcertainevils. 
35. 
It 
should 
even 
be 
concluded 
that 
there 
must 
have 
been 
great 
or 
rather 
invincible 
reasons 
which 
prompted 
the 
divine 
Wisdom 
to 
the 
permission 
of 
the 
evil 
that 
surprises 
us, 
from 
the 
mere 
fact 
that 
this 
permission 
has 
occurred: 
for 
nothing 
can 
come 
from 
God 
that 
is 
not 
altogether 
consistent 
with 
goodness, 
justice 
and 
holiness. 
Thus 
we 
can 
judge 
by 
the 
event 
(or 
a 
posteriori) 
that 
the 
permission 
was 
indispensable, 
although 
it 
be 
not 
possible 
for 
us 
to 
show 
this 
(a 
priori) 
by 
the 
detailed 
reasons 
that 
God 
can 
have 
had 
therefor; 
as 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
either 
that 
we 
show 
this 
to 
justify 
him. 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
aptly 
says 
concerning 
that 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial,vol. 
III, 
ch. 
165, 
): 
Sinmade 
itsway 
into 
theworld;Godtherefore 
was 
able 
to 
permit 
it 
without 
detriment 
to 
his 
perfections; 
ab 
actu 
ad 
potentiam 
valet 
consequentia. 
In 
God 
this 
conclusion 
holds 
good: 
he 
did 
this, 
therefore 
he 
did 
it 
well. 
It 
is 
not, 
then, 
that 
we 
have 
no 
notion 
of 
justice 
in 
general 
fit 
to 
be 
applied 
also 
to 
God’s 
justice; 
nor 
is 
it 
that 
God’s 
justice 
has 

other 
rules 
than 
the 
justice 
known 
of 
men, 
but 
that 
the 
case 
in 
question 
is 
quite 
different 
from 
those 
which 
are 
common 
among 
men. 
Universal 
right 
is 
the 
same 
for 
God 
and 
for 
men; 
but 
the 
question 
of 
fact 
is 
quite 
different 
in 
theircaseandhis. 


36. 
We 
may 
even 
assume 
or 
pretend 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
observed) 
that 
there 
is 
something 
similar 
among 
men 
to 
this 
circumstance 
in 
God’s 
actions. 
A 
man 
might 
give 
such 
great 
and 
strong 
proofs 
of 
his 
virtue 
and 
his 
holiness 
that 
all 
the 
most 
apparent 
reasons 
one 
could 
put 
forward 
against 
him 
to 
charge 
him 
with 
an 
alleged 
crime, 
for 
instance 
a 
larceny 
or 
murder, 
would 
deserve 
to 
be 
rejected 
as 
the 
calumnies 
of 
false 
witnesses 
or 
as 
an 
extraordinary 
play 
of 
chance 
which 
sometimes 
throws 
suspicion 
on 
the 
most 
innocent. 
Thus 
in 
a 
case 
where 
every 
other 
would 
run 
the 
risk 
of 
being 
condemned 
or 
put 
to 
the 
torture 
(according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
country), 
this 
man 
would 
be 
absolved 
by 
his 
judges 
unanimously. 
Now 
in 
this 
case, 
which 
indeed 
is 
rare, 
but 
which 
is 
not 
impossible, 
one 
might 
say 
in 
a 
sense 
(sano 
sensu) 
that 
there 
is 
a 
conflict 
between 
reason 
and 
faith, 
and 
that 
the 
rules 
of 
law 
are 
other 
in 
respect 
of 
this 
person 
than 
they 
are 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
remainder 
of 
mankind. 
But 
that, 
when 
explained, 
will 
signify 
only 
that 
appearances 
of 
reason 
here 
give 
way 
before 
the 
faith 
that 
is 
due 
to 
the 
word 
and 
the 
integrity 
of 
this 
great 
and 
holy 
man, 
and 
that 
he 
is 
privileged 
above 
other 
men; 
not 
indeed 
as 
if 
there 
were 
one 
law 
for 
others 
and 
another 
for 
him, 
nor 
as 
if 
one 
had 
no 
understanding 
of 
what 
justice 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
him. 
It 
is 
rather 
because 
the 
rules 
of 
universal 
justice 
do 
not 
find 
here 
the 
application 
that 
they 
receive 
elsewhere, 
or 
because 
they 
favour 
him 
instead 
of 
accusing 
him, 
since 
there 
are 
in 
this 
personage 
qualities 
so 
admirable, 
that 
by 
virtue 
of 
a 
good 
logic 
of 
probabilities 
one 
should 
place 
more 
faith 
in 
his 
word 
than 
in 
that 
ofmanyothers. 

37. 
Since 
it 
is 
permitted 
here 
to 
imagine 
possible 
cases, 
may 
one 
not 
supposethis 
incomparablemanto 
betheAdeptorthe 
Possessorof 
‘that 
blessed 
Stone 


Able 
to 
enrich 
all 
earthly 
Kings 
alone’ 


and 
that 
he 
spends 
every 
day 
prodigious 
sums 
in 
order 
to 
feed 
and 
to 
rescue 
from 
distress 
countless 
numbers 
of 
poor 
men? 
Be 
there 
never 
so 
many 
witnesses 
or 
appearances 
of 
every 
kind 
tending 
to 
prove 
that 
this 
great 
benefactor 
of 
the 
human 
race 
has 
just 
committed 
some 
larceny, 
is 
it 
not 
true 
that 
the 
whole 
earth 
would 
make 
mock 
of 
the 
accusation, 
however 
specious 
it 
might 
be? 
Now 
God 
is 
infinitely 
above 
the 
goodness 
and 
the 
power 
of 
this 
man, 
and 
consequently 
there 
are 
no 
reasons 
at 
all, 
however 
apparent 
they 
be, 
that 
can 
hold 
good 
against 
faith, 
that 
is, 
against 
the 
assurance 
or 
the 
confidence 
in 
God 
wherewith 
we 
can 
and 
ought 
to 
say 
that 
God 
has 
done 
all 
things 
well. 
The 
objections 
are 
therefore 
not 
insoluble. 
They 
only 
involve 
prejudices 
and 
probabilities, 
which 
are, 
however, 
overthrown 
by 
reasons 
incomparably 
stronger. 
One 
must 
not 
say 
either 
that 
what 
we 
call 
justice 
is 
nothing 
in 
relation 
to 
God, 
that 
he 
is 
the 
absolute 
Master 
of 
all 
things 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
being 
able 
to 
condemn 
the 
innocent 
without 
violating 
his 
justice, 
or 
finally 
that 
justice 
is 
something 
arbitrary 
where 
he 
is 
concerned. 
Those 
are 
rash 
and 
dangerous 
expressions, 
whereunto 
some 
have 
been 
led 
astray 
to 
the 
discredit 
of 
the 
attributes 
of 
God. 
For 
if 
such 
were 
the 
case 
there 
would 
be 
no 
reason 
for 
praising 
his 
goodness 
and 
his 
justice: 
rather 
would 
it 
be 
as 
if 
the 
most 
wicked 
spirit, 
the 
Prince 
of 
evil 
genii, 
the 
evil 
principle 
of 
the 
Manichaeans, 
were 
the 
sole 
master 
of 
the 
universe, 
just 
as 
I 
observed 
before. 
Whatmeanswouldtherebeof 
distinguishingthetrueGod 
fromthefalseGod 
of 
Zoroaster 
if

and

38. 
It 
is 
therefore 
more 
than 
evident 
that 
nothing 
compels 
us 
to 
commit 
ourselves 
to 
a 
doctrine 
so 
strange, 
since 
it 
suffices 
to 
say 
that 
we 
have 
not 
enough 
knowledge 
of 
the 
facts 
when 
there 
is 
a 
question 
of 
answering 
probabilities 
which 
appear 
to 
throw 
doubt 
upon 
the 
justice 
and 
the 
goodness 
of 
God, 
and 
which 
would 
vanish 
away 
if 
the 
facts 
were 
well 
known 
to 
us. 
We 
need 
neither 
renounce 
reason 
in 
order 
to 
listen 
to 
faith 
nor 
blind 
ourselves 
in 
order 
to 
see 
clearly, 
as 
Queen 
Christine 
used 
to 
say: 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
reject 
ordinary 
appearances 
when 
they 
are 
contrary 
to 
Mysteries; 
and 
this 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
reason, 
since 
even 
in 
natural 
things 
we 
are 
very 
often 
undeceived 
about 
appearances 
either 
by 
experience 
or 
by 
superior 
reasons. 
All 
that 
has 
been 
set 
down 
here 
in 
advance, 
only 
with 
the 
object 
of 
showing 
more 
plainly 
wherein 
the 
fault 
of 
the 
objections 
and 
the 
abuse 
of 
reason 
consists 
in 
the 
present 
case, 
where 
the 
claim 
is 
made 
that 
reason 
has 
greatest 
force 
against 
faith: 
we 
shall 
come 
afterwards 
to 
a 
more 
exact 
discussion 
of 
that 
which 
concernstheoriginofeviland 
thepermissionofsinwithitsconsequences. 
39. 
For 
now, 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
continue 
our 
examination 
of 
the 
important 
question 
of 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
in 
theology, 
and 
to 
make 
reflexions 
upon 
what 
M. 
Bayle 
has 
said 
thereon 
in 
divers 
passages 
of 
his 
works. 
As 
he 
paid 
particular 
attention 
in 
his 
Historical 
and 
Critical 
Dictionary 
to 
expounding 
the 
objections 
of 
the 
Manichaeans 
and 
those 
of 
the 
Pyrrhonians, 
and 
as 
this 
procedure 
had 
been 
criticized 
by 
some 
persons 
zealous 
for 
religion, 
he 
placed 
a 
dissertation 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
this 
Dictionary, 
which 
aimed 
at 
showing, 
by 
examples, 
by 
authorities 
and 
by 
reasons, 
the 
innocence 
and 
usefulness 
of 
his 
course 
of 
action. 
I 
am 
persuaded 
(as 
I 
have 
said 
above) 
that 
the 
specious 
objections 
one 
can 
urge 
against 
truth 
are 
very 
useful, 
and 
that 
they 
serve 
to 
confirm 
and 
to 
illumine 
it, 
giving 
opportunity 
to 
intelligent 
persons 
to 
find 
new 
openings 
or 
to 
turn 
the 
old 
to 
better 
account. 
But 
M. 
Bayle 
seeks 
therein 
a 
usefulness 
quite 
the 
reverse 
of 
this: 
it 
would 
be 
that 
of 

displaying 
the 
power 
of 
faith 
by 
showing 
that 
the 
truths 
it 
teaches 
cannot 
sustain 
the 
attacks 
of 
reason 
and 
that 
it 
nevertheless 
holds 
its 
own 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
faithful. 
M. 
Nicole 
seems 
to 
call 
that 
‘the 
triumph 
of 
God’s 
authority 
over 
human 
reason’, 
in 
the 
words 
of 
his 
quoted 
by 
M. 
Bayle 
in 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
his 
Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial 
(ch. 
177, 
). 
But 
since 
reason 
is 
a 
gift 
of 
God, 
even 
as 
faith 
is,contention 
betweenthem 
would 
cause 
God 
to 
contend 
against 
God; 
and 
if 
the 
objections 
of 
reason 
against 
any 
article 
of 
faith 
are 
insoluble, 
then 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
this 
alleged 
article 
will 
be 
false 
and 
not 
revealed: 
this 
will 
be 
a 
chimera 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
and 
the 
triumph 
of 
this 
faith 
will 
be 
capable 
of 
comparison 
with 
bonfires 
lighted 
after 
a 
defeat. 
Such 
is 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
damnation 
of 
unbaptized 
children, 
which 


M. 
Nicole 
would 
have 
us 
assume 
to 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
original 
sin; 
such 
would 
be 
the 
eternal 
damnation 
of 
adults 
lacking 
the 
light 
that 
is 
necessary 
fortheattainmentof 
salvation. 
40. 
Yet 
everyone 
need 
not 
enter 
into 
theological 
discussions; 
and 
persons 
whose 
condition 
allows 
not 
of 
exact 
researches 
should 
be 
content 
with 
instruction 
on 
faith, 
without 
being 
disturbed 
by 
the 
objections; 
and 
if 
some 
exceeding 
great 
difficulty 
should 
happen 
to 
strike 
them, 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
them 
to 
avert 
the 
mind 
from 
it, 
offering 
to 
God 
a 
sacrifice 
of 
their 
curiosity: 
for 
when 
one 
is 
assured 
of 
a 
truth 
one 
has 
no 
need 
to 
listen 
to 
the 
objections. 
As 
there 
are 
many 
people 
whose 
faith 
is 
rather 
small 
and 
shallow 
to 
withstand 
such 
dangerous 
tests, 
I 
think 
one 
must 
not 
present 
them 
with 
that 
which 
might 
be 
poisonous 
for 
them; 
or, 
if 
one 
cannot 
hide 
from 
them 
what

onlytoopublic,theantidote 
mustbeaddedtoit; 
thatis

41. 
The 
passages 
from 
the 
excellent 
theologians 
who 
speak 
of 
this 
triumph 
of 
faith 
can 
and 
should 
receive 
a 
meaning 
appropriate 
to 
the 
principles 
I 
have 
just 
affirmed. 
There 
appear 
in 
some 
objects 
of 
faith 
two 
great 
qualities 

capable 
of 
making 
it 
triumph 
over 
reason, 
the 
one 
is 
incomprehensibility, 
the 
other 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
probability. 
But 
one 
must 
beware 
of 
adding 
thereto 
the 
third 
quality 
whereof 
M. 
Bayle 
speaks, 
and 
of 
saying 
that 
what 
one 
believes 
is 
indefensible: 
for 
that 
would 
be 
to 
cause 
reason 
in 
its 
turn 
to 
triumph 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
would 
destroy 
faith. 
Incomprehensibility 
does 
not 
prevent 
us 
from 
believing 
even 
natural 
truths. 
For 
instance 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
pointed 
out) 
we 
do 
not 
comprehend 
the 
nature 
of 
odours 
and 
savours, 
and 
yet 
we 
are 
persuaded, 
byakind 
of 
faithwhichwe 
owe 
to 
the 
evidence 
ofthe 
senses, 
that 
these 
perceptible 
qualities 
are 
founded 
upon 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
and 
that 
they 
arenotillusions. 


42. 
There 
are 
also 
things 
contrary 
to 
appearances, 
which 
we 
admit 
when 
they 
are 
sufficiently 
verified. 
There 
is 
a 
little 
romance 
of 
Spanish 
origin, 
whose 
title 
states 
that 
one 
must 
not 
always 
believe 
what 
one 
sees. 
What 
was 
there 
more 
specious 
than 
the 
lie 
of 
the 
false 
Martin 
Guerre, 
who 
was 
acknowledged 
as 
the 
true 
Martin 
by 
the 
true 
Martin’s 
wife 
and 
relatives, 
and 
caused 
the 
judges 
and 
the 
relatives 
to 
waver 
for 
a 
long 
time 
even 
after 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
other? 
Nevertheless 
the 
truth 
was 
known 
in 
the 
end. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
faith. 
I 
have 
already 
observed 
that 
all 
one 
can 
oppose 
to 
the 
goodness 
and 
the 
justice 
of 
God 
is 
nothing 
but 
appearances, 
which 
would 
be 
strong 
against 
a 
man, 
but 
which 
are 
nullified 
when 
they 
are 
applied 
to 
God 
and 
when 
they 
are 
weighed 
against 
the 
proofs 
that 
assure 
us 
of 
the 
infinite 
perfection 
of 
his 
attributes. 
Thus 
faith 
triumphs 
over 
false 
reasons 
by 
means 
of 
sound 
and 
superior 
reasons 
that 
have 
made 
us 
embrace 
it; 
but 
it 
would 
not 
triumph 
if 
the 
contrary 
opinion 
had 
for 
it 
reasons 
as 
strong 
as 
or 
even 
stronger 
than 
those 
which 
form 
the 
foundation 
of 
faith, 
that 
is, 
if 
there 
were 
invincibleand 
conclusiveobjectionsagainstfaith. 
43. 
It 
is 
well 
also 
to 
observe 
here 
that 
what 
M. 
Bayle 
calls 
a 
‘triumph 
of 
faith’ 
is 
in 
part 
a 
triumph 
of 
demonstrative 
reason 
against 
apparent 
and 

deceptive 
reasons 
which 
are 
improperly 
set 
against 
the 
demonstrations. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration 
that 
the 
objections 
of 
the 
Manichaeans 
are 
hardly 
less 
contrary 
to 
natural 
theology 
than 
to 
revealed 
theology. 
And 
supposing 
one 
surrendered 
to 
them 
Holy 
Scripture, 
original 
sin, 
the 
grace 
of 
God 
in 
Jesus 
Christ, 
the 
pains 
of 
hell 
and 
the 
other 
articles 
of 
our 
religion, 
one 
would 
not 
even 
so 
be 
delivered 
from 
their 
objections: 
for 
one 
cannot 
deny 
that 
there 
is 
in 
the 
world 
physical 
evil 
(that 
is, 
suffering) 
and 
moral 
evil 
(that 
is, 
crime) 
and 
even 
that 
physical 
evil 
is 
not 
always 
distributed 
here 
on 
earth 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
moral 
evil, 
as 
it 
seems 
that 
justice 
demands. 
There 
remains, 
then, 
this 
question 
of 
natural 
theology, 
how 
a 
sole 
Principle, 
all-good,all-wise 
and 
all-powerful, 
has 
been 
able 
to 
admit 
evil, 
and 
especially 
to 
permit 
sin, 
and 
how 
it 
could 
resolve 
to 
make 
the 
wicked 
often 
happy 
andthegood 
unhappy? 


44. 
Now 
we 
have 
no 
need 
of 
revealed 
faith 
to 
know 
that 
there 
is 
such 
a 
sole 
Principle 
of 
all 
things, 
entirely 
good 
and 
wise. 
Reason 
teaches 
us 
this 
by 
infallible 
proofs; 
and 
in 
consequence 
all 
the 
objections 
taken 
from 
the 
course 
of 
things, 
in 
which 
we 
observe 
imperfections, 
are 
only 
based 
on 
false 
appearances. 
For, 
if 
we 
were 
capable 
of 
understanding 
the 
universal 
harmony, 
we 
should 
see 
that 
what 
we 
are 
tempted 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
plan 
most 
worthy 
of 
being 
chosen; 
in 
a 
word, 
we 
should 
see, 
and 
should 
not 
believe 
only, 
that 
what 
God 
has 
done 
is 
the 
best. 
I 
call 
‘seeing’ 
here 
what 
one 
knows 
a 
priori 
by 
the 
causes; 
and 
‘believing’ 
what 
one 
only 
judges 
by 
the 
effects, 
even 
though 
the 
one 
be 
as 
certainly 
known 
as 
the 
other. 
And 
one 
can 
apply 
here 
too 
the 
saying 
of 
St. 
Paul 
(2 
Cor. 
v. 
7), 
that 
we 
walk 
by 
faith 
and 
not 
by 
sight. 
For 
the 
infinite 
wisdom 
of 
God 
being 
known 
to 
us, 
we 
conclude 
that 
the 
evils 
we 
experience 
had 
to 
be 
permitted, 
and 
this 
we 
conclude 
from 
the 
effect 
or 
a 
posteriori, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
because 
they 
exist. 
It 
is 
whatM. 
Bayle 
acknowledges; 
and 
he 
oughtto 
content 
himself 

with 
that, 
and 
not 
claim 
that 
one 
must 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
false 
appearances 
which 
are 
contrary 
thereto. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
one 
asked 
that 
there 
should 
be 
no 
more 
dreamsoroptical 
illusions. 


45. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
doubted 
that 
this 
faith 
and 
this 
confidence 
in 
God, 
who 
gives 
us 
insight 
into 
his 
infinite 
goodness 
and 
prepares 
us 
for 
his 
love, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
appearances 
of 
harshness 
that 
may 
repel 
us, 
are 
an 
admirable 
exercise 
for 
the 
virtues 
of 
Christian 
theology, 
when 
the 
divine 
grace 
in 
Jesus 
Christ 
arouses 
these 
motions 
within 
us. 
That 
is 
what 
Luther 
aptly 
observed 
in 
opposition 
to 
Erasmus, 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
love 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
to 
love 
him 
who 
to 
flesh 
and 
blood 
appears 
so 
unlovable, 
so 
harsh 
toward 
the 
unfortunate 
and 
so 
ready 
to 
condemn, 
and 
to 
condemn 
for 
evils 
in 
which 
he 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
cause 
or 
accessary, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
those 
who 
allow 
themselves 
to 
be 
dazzled 
by 
false 
reasons. 
One 
may 
therefore 
say 
that 
the 
triumph 
of 
true 
reason 
illumined 
by 
divine 
grace 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
triumph 
of 
faith 
and 
love. 
46. 
M. 
Bayle 
appears 
to 
have 
taken 
the 
matter 
quite 
otherwise: 
he 
declares 
himselfagainst 
reason,when 
hemight 
have 
been 
content 
to 
censure 
its 
abuse. 
He 
quotes 
the 
words 
of 
Cotta 
in 
Cicero, 
where 
he 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
say 
that 
if 
reason 
were 
a 
gift 
of 
the 
gods 
providence 
would 
be 
to 
blame 
for 
having 
given 
it, 
since 
it 
tends 
to 
our 
harm. 
M. 
Bayle 
also 
thinks 
that 
human 
reason 
is 
a 
source 
of 
destruction 
and 
not 
of 
edification 
(Historical 
and 
Critical 
Dictionary,, 
col. 
2), 
that 
it 
is 
a 
runner 
who 
knows 
not 
where 
to 
stop, 
and 
who, 
like 
another 
Penelope,herselfdestroysherownwork. 
Destruit, 
aedificat, 
mutat 
quadrata 
rotundis. 


(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
III, 
). 
But 
he 
takes 
pains 
especially 
to 
pile 
up 
many 
authorities 
one 
upon 
the 
other, 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
theologians 
of 
all 
parties 
reject 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
just 
as 
he 
does, 
and 
that 
they 
call 
attention 
to 
such 
gleams 
of 
reason 
as 
oppose 
religion 
only 
that 
they 



may 
sacrifice 
them 
to 
faith 
by 
a 
mere 
repudiation, 
answering 
nothing 
but 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
argument 
that 
is 
brought 
against 
them. 
He 
begins 
with 
the 
New 
Testament. 
Jesus 
Christ 
was 
content 
to 
say: 
‘Follow 
Me’ 
(Luke 
v. 
27; 


ix. 
59). 
The 
Apostles 
said: 
‘Believe, 
and 
thou 
shalt 
be 
saved’ 
(Acts 
xvi. 
3). 
St. 
Paulacknowledgesthat 
his 
‘doctrineisobscure’ 
(1Cor. 
xiii. 
12),that 
‘one 
can 
comprehend 
nothing 
therein’ 
unless 
God 
impart 
a 
spiritual 
discernment, 
and 
without 
that 
it 
only 
passes 
for 
foolishness 
(1 
Cor. 
ii. 
14). 
He 
exhorts 
the 
faithful 
‘to 
beware 
of 
philosophy’ 
(Col. 
ii. 
8) 
and 
to 
avoid 
disputations 
in 
that 
science,whichhad 
causedmany 
personstolose 
faith. 
47. 
As 
for 
the 
Fathers 
of 
the 
Church, 
M. 
Bayle 
refers 
us 
to 
the 
collection 
of 
passages 
from 
them 
against 
the 
use 
of 
philosophy 
and 
of 
reason 
which 
M. 
de 
Launoy 
made 
(De 
Varia 
Aristotelis 
Fortuna, 
ca) 
and 
especially 
to 
the 
passages 
from 
St. 
Augustine 
collected 
by 
M. 
Arnauld 
(against 
Mallet), 
which 
state: 
that 
the 
judgements 
of 
God 
are 
inscrutable; 
that 
they 
are 
not 
any 
the 
less 
just 
for 
that 
they 
are 
unknown 
to 
us; 
that 
it 
is 
a 
deep 
abyss, 
which 
one 
cannot 
fathomwithout 
running 
the 
risk 
of 
falling 
downthe 
precipice; 
that 
one 
cannot 
without 
temerity 
try 
to 
elucidate 
that 
which 
God 
willed 
to 
keep 
hidden; 
that 
his 
will 
cannot 
but 
be 
just; 
that 
many 
men, 
having 
tried 
to 
explain 
this 
incomprehensible 
depth, 
have 
fallen 
into 
vain 
imaginations 
and 
opinions 
fulloferrorandbewilderment. 
48. 
The 
Schoolmen 
have 
spoken 
in 
like 
manner. 
M. 
Bayle 
quotes 
a 
beautiful 
passage 
from 
Cardinal 
Cajetan 
(Part 
I, 
Summ. 
qu. 
22, 
art. 
4) 
to 
this 
effect: 
‘Our 
mind’, 
he 
says, 
‘rests 
not 
upon 
the 
evidence 
of 
known 
truth 
but 
upon 
the 
impenetrable 
depth 
of 
hidden 
truth. 
And 
as 
St. 
Gregory 
says: 
He 
who 
believes 
touching 
the 
Divinity 
only 
that 
which 
he 
can 
gauge 
with 
his 
mind 
belittles 
the 
idea 
of 
God. 
Yet 
I 
do 
not 
surmise 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
deny 
any 
of 
the 
things 
which 
we 
know, 
or 
which 
we 
see 
as 
appertaining 
to 
the 
immutability, 
the 
actuality, 
the 
certainty, 
the 
universality, 
etc. 
of 
God: 
but 

I 
think 
that 
there 
is 
here 
some 
secret, 
either 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
relation 
which 
exists 
between 
God 
and 
the 
event, 
or 
in 
respect 
of 
what 
connects 
the 
event 
itself 
with 
his 
prevision. 
Thus, 
reflecting 
that 
the 
understanding 
of 
our 
soul 
is 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
owl, 
I 
find 
the 
soul’s 
repose 
only 
in 
ignorance. 
For 
it 
is 
better 
both 
forthe 
Catholic 
Faithandfor 
Philosophic 
Faithtoconfess 
our 
blindness, 
than 
to 
affirm 
as 
evident 
what 
does 
not 
afford 
our 
mind 
the 
contentment 
which 
self-evidence 
gives. 
I 
do 
not 
accuse 
of 
presumption, 
on 
that 
account, 
all 
the 
learned 
men 
who 
stammeringly 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
suggest, 
as 
far 
as 
in 
them 
lay, 
the 
immobility 
and 
the 
sovereign 
and 
eternal 
efficacy 
of 
the 
understanding, 
of 
the 
will 
and 
of 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
through 
the 
infallibility 
of 
divine 
election 
and 
divine 
relation 
to 
all 
events. 
Nothing 
of 
all 
that 
interferes 
with 
my 
surmise 
that 
there 
is 
some 
depth 
which 
is 
hidden 
from 
us.’ 
This 
passage 
of 
Cajetan 
is 
all 
the 
more 
notable 
since 
he 
was 
an 
author 
competent 
toreachtheheartofthematter. 


49. 
Luther’s 
book 
against 
Erasmus 
is 
full 
of 
vigorous 
comments 
hostile 
to 
those 
who 
desire 
to 
submit 
revealed 
truths 
to 
the 
tribunal 
of 
our 
reason. 
Calvin 
often 
speaks 
in 
the 
same 
tone, 
against 
the 
inquisitive 
daring 
of 
those 
who 
seek 
to 
penetrate 
into 
the 
counsels 
of 
God. 
He 
declares 
in 
his 
treatise 
on 
predestination 
that 
God 
had 
just 
causes 
for 
damning 
some 
men, 
but 
causes 
unknown 
to 
us. 
Finally 
M. 
Bayle 
quotes 
sundry 
modern 
writers 
who 
have 
spoken 
to 
the 
same 
effect 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
ch. 
161 
et 
seq.). 
50. 
But 
all 
these 
expressions 
and 
innumerable 
others 
like 
them 
do 
not 
prove 
that 
the 
objections 
opposed 
to 
faith 
are 
so 
insoluble 
as 
M. 
Bayle 
supposes. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
counsels 
of 
God 
are 
inscrutable, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
invincible 
objection 
which 
tends 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
they 
are 
unjust. 
What 
appears 
injustice 
on 
the 
part 
of 
God, 
and 
foolishness 
in 
our 
faith, 
only 
appears 
so. 
The 
famous 
passage 
of 
Tertullian 
(De 
Carne 
Christi), 
‘mortuus 

est 
Dei 
filius, 
credibile 
est, 
quia 
ineptum 
est; 
et 
sepultus 
revixit, 
certum 
est, 
quia 
impossibile’, 
is 
a 
sally 
that 
can 
only 
be 
meant 
to 
concern 
appearances 
of 
absurdity. 
There 
are 
others 
like 
them 
in 
Luther’s 
book 
on 
Freewill 
in 
Bondage, 
as 
when 
he 
says 
(ch. 
174): 
‘Si 
placet 
tibi 
Deus 
indignos 
coronans, 
non 
debet 
displicere 
immeritos 
damnans.’ 
Which 
being 
reduced 
to 
more 
temperate 
phrasing, 
means: 
If 
you 
approve 
that 
God 
give 
eternal 
glory 
to 
those 
who 
are 
not 
better 
than 
the 
rest, 
you 
should 
not 
disapprove 
that 
he 
abandon 
those 
who 
are 
not 
worse 
than 
the 
rest. 
And 
to 
judge 
that 
he 
speaks 
only 
of 
appearances 
of 
injustice, 
one 
only 
has 
to 
weigh 
these 
words 
of 
the 
same 
author 
taken 
from 
the 
same 
book: 
‘In 
all 
the 
rest’, 
he 
says, 
‘we 
recognize 
in 
God 
a 
supreme 
majesty; 
there 
is 
only 
justice 
that 
we 
dare 
to 
question: 
and 
we 
will 
not 
believe 
provisionally 
[tantisper] 
that 
he 
is 
just, 
albeit 
he 
has 
promised 
us 
that 
the 
time 
shall 
come 
when 
his 
glory 
being 
revealedallmenshallseeclearlythathe 
has 
been 
andthatheisjust.’ 


51. 
It 
will 
be 
found 
also 
that 
when 
the 
Fathers 
entered 
into 
a 
discussion 
they 
did 
not 
simply 
reject 
reason. 
And, 
in 
disputations 
with 
the 
pagans, 
they 
endeavour 
usually 
to 
show 
how 
paganism 
is 
contrary 
to 
reason, 
and 
how 
the 
Christian 
religion 
has 
the 
better 
of 
it 
on 
that 
side 
also. 
Origen 
showed 
Celsus 
how 
reasonable 
Christianity 
is 
and 
why, 
notwithstanding, 
the 
majority 
of 
Christians 
should 
believe 
without 
examination. 
Celsus 
had 
jeered 
at 
the 
behaviour 
of 
Christians, 
‘who, 
willing’, 
he 
said, 
‘neither 
to 
listen 
to 
your 
reasons 
nor 
to 
give 
you 
any 
for 
what 
they 
believe, 
are 
content 
to 
say 
to 
you: 
Examine 
not, 
only 
believe, 
or: 
Your 
faith 
will 
save 
you; 
and 
they 
hold 
this 
as 
a 
maxim,thatthe 
wisdom 
oftheworld 
isanevil.’ 
52. 
Origen 
gives 
the 
answer 
of 
a 
wise 
man, 
and 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
principles 
we 
have 
established 
in 
the 
matter. 
For 
reason, 
far 
from 
being 
contrary 
to 
Christianity, 
serves 
as 
a 
foundation 
for 
this 
religion, 
and 
will 

bring 
about 
its 
acceptance 
by 
those 
who 
can 
achieve 
the 
examination 
of 
it. 
But, 
as 
few 
people 
are 
capable 
of 
this, 
the 
heavenly 
gift 
of 
plain 
faith 
tending 
towards 
good 
suffices 
for 
men 
in 
general. 
‘If 
it 
were 
possible’, 
he 
says, 
‘for 
all 
men, 
neglecting 
the 
affairs 
of 
life, 
to 
apply 
themselves 
to 
study 
and 
meditation, 
one 
need 
seek 
no 
other 
way 
to 
make 
them 
accept 
the 
Christian 
religion. 
For, 
to 
say 
nothing 
likely 
to 
offend 
anyone’ 
(he 
insinuates 
that 
the 
pagan 
religion 
is 
absurd, 
but 
he 
will 
not 
say 
so 
explicitly), 
‘there 
will 
be 
found 
therein 
no 
less 
exactitude 
than 
elsewhere, 
whether 
in 
the 
discussion 
of 
its 
dogmas, 
or 
in 
the 
elucidation 
of 
the 
enigmatical 
expressions 
of 
its 
prophets, 
or 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
parables 
of 
its 
gospels 
and 
of 
countless 
other 
things 
happening 
or 
ordained 
symbolically. 
But 
since 
neither 
the 
necessities 
of 
life 
nor 
the 
infirmities 
of 
men 
permit 
of 
this 
application 
to 
study, 
save 
for 
a 
very 
small 
number 
of 
persons, 
what 
means 
could 
one 
find 
more 
qualified 
to 
benefit 
everyone 
else 
in 
the 
world 
than 
those 
Jesus 
Christ 
wished 
to 
be 
used 
for 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
nations? 
And 
I 
would 
fain 
ask 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
great 
number 
of 
those 
who 
believe, 
and 
who 
thereby 
have 
withdrawn 
themselves 
from 
the 
quagmire 
of 
vices 
wherein 
before 
they 
were 
plunged, 
which 
would 
be 
the 
better: 
to 
have 
thus 
changed 
one’s 
morals 
and 
reformed 
one’slife, 
believing 
without 
examination 
thatthere 
are 
punishments 
for 
sin 
and 
rewards 
for 
good 
actions; 
or 
to 
have 
waited 
for 
one’s 
conversion 
until 
one 
not 
only 
believed 
but 
had 
examined 
with 
care 
the 
foundations 
of 
these 
dogmas? 
It 
is 
certain 
that, 
were 
this 
method 
to 
be 
followed, 
few 
indeed 
would 
reach 
that 
point 
whither 
they 
are 
led 
by 
their 
plain 
and 
simple 
faith, 
butthemajoritywouldremainintheir 
corruption.’ 


53. 
M. 
Bayle 
(in 
his 
explanation 
concerning 
the 
objections 
of 
the 
Manichaeans, 
placed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
the 
Dictionary) 
takes 
those 
words 
where 
Origen 
points 
out 
that 
religion 
can 
stand 
the 
test 
of 
having 
her 
dogmas 
discussed, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
not 
meant 
in 
relation 
to 
philosophy, 
but 

only 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
accuracy 
wherewith 
the 
authority 
and 
the 
true 
meaning 
of 
Holy 
Scripture 
is 
established. 
But 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
indicate 
this 
restriction. 
Origenwroteagainstaphilosopherwhomsucharestrictionwould 
not 
have 
suited. 
And 
it 
appears 
that 
this 
Father 
wished 
to 
point 
out 
that 
among 
Christians 
there 
was 
no 
less 
exactitude 
than 
among 
the 
Stoics 
and 
some 
other 
philosophers, 
who 
established 
their 
doctrine 
as 
much 
by 
reason 
as 
by 
authorities, 
as, 
for 
example, 
Chrysippus 
did, 
who 
found 
his 
philosophy 
evenin 
thesymbolsof 
paganantiquity. 


54. 
Celsus 
brings 
up 
still 
another 
objection 
to 
the 
Christians, 
in 
the 
same 
place. 
‘If 
they 
withdraw’, 
he 
says, 
‘regularly 
into 
their 
“Examine 
not, 
only 
believe”, 
they 
must 
tell 
me 
at 
least 
what 
are 
the 
things 
they 
wish 
me 
to 
believe.’ 
Therein 
he 
is 
doubtless 
right, 
and 
that 
tells 
against 
those 
who 
would 
say 
that 
God 
is 
good 
and 
just, 
and 
who 
yet 
would 
maintain 
that 
we 
have 
no 
notion 
of 
goodness 
and 
of 
justice 
when 
we 
attribute 
these 
perfections 
to 
him. 
But 
one 
must 
not 
always 
demand 
what 
I 
call 
‘adequate 
notions’, 
involving 
nothing 
that 
is 
not 
explained, 
since 
even 
perceptible 
qualities, 
like 
heat, 
light, 
sweetness, 
cannot 
give 
us 
such 
notions. 
Thus 
we 
agreed 
that 
Mysteries 
should 
receivean 
explanation,butthis 
explanationisimperfect. 
Itsufficesfor 
us 
to 
have 
some 
analogical 
understanding 
of 
a 
Mystery 
such 
as 
the 
Trinity 
and 
the 
Incarnation, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
in 
accepting 
them 
we 
pronounce 
not 
words 
altogether 
devoid 
of 
meaning: 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
explanation 
go 
as 
far 
as 
we 
would 
wish, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
comprehension 
andtothe 
how. 
55. 
It 
appears 
strange 
therefore 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
rejects 
the 
tribunal 
of 
common 
notions 
(in 
the 
third 
volume 
of 
his 
Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
p 
and 
1140) 
as 
if 
one 
should 
not 
consult 
the 
idea 
of 
goodness 
in 
answering 
the 
Manichaeans; 
whereas 
he 
had 
declared 
himself 
quite 
differently 
in 
his 
Dictionary. 
Of 
necessity 
there 
must 
be 
agreement 
upon 
the 

meaning 
of 
good 
and 
bad, 
amongst 
those 
who 
are 
in 
dispute 
over 
the 
question 
whether 
there 
is 
only 
one 
principle, 
altogether 
good, 
or 
whether 
there 
are 
two, 
the 
one 
good 
and 
the 
other 
bad. 
We 
understand 
something 
by 
union 
when 
we 
are 
told 
of 
the 
union 
of 
one 
body 
with 
another 
or 
of 
a 
substance 
with 
its 
accident, 
of 
a 
subject 
with 
its 
adjunct, 
of 
the 
place 
with 
the 
moving 
body, 
of 
the 
act 
with 
the 
potency; 
we 
also 
mean 
something 
when 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body 
to 
make 
thereof 
one 
single 
person. 
For 
albeit 
I 
do 
not 
hold 
that 
the 
soul 
changes 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
body, 
or 
that 
the 
body 
changes 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
I 
have 
introduced 
the 
Preestablished 
Harmony 
to 
avoid 
this 
derangement, 
I 
nevertheless 
admit 
a 
true 
union 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
which 
makes 
thereof 
a 
suppositum. 
This 
union 
belongs 
to 
the 
metaphysical, 
whereas 
a 
union 
of 
influence 
would 
belong 
to 
the 
physical. 
But 
when 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
union 
of 
the 
Word 
of 
God 
with 
human 
nature 
we 
should 
be 
content 
with 
an 
analogical 
knowledge, 
such 
as 
the 
comparison 
of 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body 
is 
capable 
of 
giving 
us. 
We 
should, 
moreover, 
be 
content 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Incarnation 
is 
the 
closest 
union 
that 
can 
exist 
between 
the 
Creator 
and 
the 
creature; 
and 
further 
we 
should 
notwant 
togo. 


56. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
other 
Mysteries, 
where 
moderate 
minds 
will 
ever 
find 
an 
explanation 
sufficient 
for 
belief, 
but 
never 
such 
as 
would 
be 
necessary 
for 
understanding. 
A 
certain 
what 
it 
is 
(τι 
εστι) 
is 
enough 
for 
us, 
but 
the 
how 
(πως) 
is 
beyond 
us, 
and 
is 
not 
necessary 
for 
us. 
One 
may 
say 
concerning 
the 
explanations 
of 
Mysteries 
which 
are 
given 
out 
here 
and 
there, 
what 
the 
Queen 
of 
Sweden 
inscribed 
upon 
a 
medal 
concerning 
the 
crown 
she 
had 
abandoned, 
‘Non 
mi 
bisogna, 
e 
non 
mi 
basta.’ 
Nor 
have 
we 
any 
need 
either 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
observed) 
to 
prove 
the 
Mysteries 
a 
priori, 
or 
to 
give 
a 
reasonforthem;itsufficesus 
that 
the 
thing 
is 
thus 
(το 
‛οτι) 
even 
though 
we 

knownotthe 
why 
(το 
διοτι), 
which 
God 
hasreservedfor 
himself. 
These 
lines, 
writtenonthatthemeby

beautifuland 
renowned: 


Ne

Quaecumque

sed

Nescire

quae

Docere 
non 
vult, 
erudita 
inscitia 
est. 


M. 
Bayle, 
who 
quotes 
them 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
III, 
), 
holds 
the 
likely 
opinion 
that 
Scaliger 
made 
them 
upon 
the 
disputes 
between 
Arminius 
and 
Gomarus. 
I 
think 
M. 
Bayle 
repeated 
them 
from 
memory, 
for 
he 
put 
sacrata 
instead 
of 
afflata. 
But 
it 
is 
apparently 
the 
printer’s 
fault 
that 
prudenter 
stands 
in 
place 
of 
pudenter 
(that 
is, 
modestly) 
which 
the 
metrerequires. 
57. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
more 
judicious 
than 
the 
warning 
these 
lines 
contain; 
and 
M. 
Bayle 
is 
right 
in 
saying 
() 
that 
those 
who 
claim 
that 
the 
behaviour 
of 
God 
with 
respect 
to 
sin 
and 
the 
consequences 
of 
sin 
contains 
nothing 
but 
what 
they 
can 
account 
for, 
deliver 
themselves 
up 
to 
the 
mercy 
of 
their 
adversary. 
But 
he 
is 
not 
right 
in 
combining 
here 
two 
very 
different 
things, 
‘to 
account 
for 
a 
thing’, 
and 
‘to 
uphold 
it 
against 
objections’; 
as 
he 
does 
when 
he 
presently 
adds: 
‘They 
are 
obliged 
to 
follow 
him 
[their 
adversary] 
everywhere 
whither 
he 
shall 
wish 
to 
lead 
them, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
to 
retire 
ignominiously 
and 
ask 
for 
quarter, 
if 
they 
were 
to 
admit 
that 
our 
intelligence 
is 
too 
weak 
to 
removecompletelyalltheobjectionsadvancedbyaphilosopher.’ 
58. 
Itseems 
herethat, 
according 
toM. 
Bayle, 
‘accounting 
for’ 
comes 
short 
of 
‘answering 
objections’, 
since 
he 
threatens 
one 
who 
should 
undertake 
the 

first 
with 
the 
resulting 
obligation 
to 
pass 
on 
to 
the 
second. 
But 
it 
is 
quite 
the 
opposite: 
he 
who 
maintains 
a 
thesis 
(the 
respondens) 
is 
not 
bound 
to 
account 
for 
it, 
but 
he 
is 
bound 
to 
meet 
the 
objections 
of 
an 
opponent. 
A 
defendant 
in 
law 
is 
not 
bound 
(as 
a 
general 
rule) 
to 
prove 
his 
right 
or 
to 
produce 
his 
title 
to 
possession; 
but 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
reply 
to 
the 
arguments 
of 
the 
plaintiff. 
I 
have 
marvelled 
many 
times 
that 
a 
writer 
so 
precise 
and 
so 
shrewd 
as 
M. 
Bayle 
so 
often 
here 
confuses 
things 
where 
so 
much 
difference 
exists 
as 
between 
these 
three 
acts 
of 
reason: 
to 
comprehend, 
to 
prove, 
and 
to 
answer 
objections; 
as 
if 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
in 
theology 
one 
term 
were 
as 
good 
as 
another. 
Thus 
he 
says 
in 
his 
posthumous 
Conversations,: 
‘There 
is 
no 
principle 
which 
M. 
Bayle 
has 
more 
often 
inculcated 
than 
this, 
that 
the 
incomprehensibility 
of 
a 
dogma 
and 
the 
insolubility 
of 
the 
objections 
that 
oppose 
it 
provide 
no 
legitimate 
reason 
for 
rejecting 
it.’ 
This 
is 
true 
as 
regards 
the 
incomprehensibility, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
the 
insolubility. 
And 
it 
is 
indeed 
just 
as 
if 
one 
said 
that 
an 
invincible 
reason 
against 
a 
thesis 
was 
not 
a 
legitimate 
reason 
for 
rejecting 
it. 
For 
what 
other 
legitimate 
reason 
for 
rejecting 
an 
opinion 
can 
one 
find, 
if 
an 
invincible 
opposing 
argument 
is 
not 
such 
an 
one? 
And 
what 
means 
shall 
one 
have 
thereafter 
of 
demonstrating 
the 
falsity, 
andeven 
theabsurdity,ofanyopinion? 


59. 
It 
is 
well 
to 
observe 
also 
that 
he 
who 
proves 
a 
thing 
a 
priori 
accounts 
for 
it 
through 
the 
efficient 
cause; 
and 
whosoever 
can 
thus 
account 
for 
it 
in 
a 
precise 
and 
adequate 
manner 
is 
also 
in 
a 
position 
to 
comprehend 
the 
thing. 
Therefore 
it 
was 
that 
the 
Scholastic 
theologians 
had 
already 
censured 
Raymond 
Lully 
for 
having 
undertaken 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
Trinity 
by 
philosophy. 
This 
so-called 
demonstration 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
his 
Works; 
and 
Bartholomaeus 
Keckermann, 
a 
writer 
renowned 
in 
the 
Reformed 
party, 
having 
made 
an 
attempt 
of 
just 
the 
same 
kind 
upon 
the 
same 
Mystery, 
has 
been 
no 
less 
censured 
for 
it 
by 
some 
modern 
theologians. 
Therefore 
censure 

will 
fall 
upon 
those 
who 
shall 
wish 
to 
account 
for 
this 
Mystery 
and 
make 
it 
comprehensible, 
but 
praise 
will 
be 
given 
to 
those 
who 
shall 
toil 
to 
uphold 
it 
againsttheobjectionsofadversaries. 


60. 
I 
have 
said 
already 
that 
theologians 
usually 
distinguish 
between 
what 
is 
above 
reason 
and 
what 
is 
against 
reason. 
They 
place 
above 
reason 
that 
which 
onecannotcomprehend 
and 
whichone 
cannot 
account 
for. 
But 
against 
reason 
will 
be 
all 
opinion 
that 
is 
opposed 
by 
invincible 
reasons, 
or 
the 
contrary 
of 
which 
can 
be 
proved 
in 
a 
precise 
and 
sound 
manner. 
They 
avow, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
are 
above 
reason, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
admit 
that 
they 
are 
contrary 
to 
it. 
The 
English 
author 
of 
a 
book 
which 
is 
ingenious, 
but 
has 
met 
with 
disapproval, 
entitled 
Christianity 
not 
Mysterious, 
wished 
to 
combat 
this 
distinction; 
but 
it 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
that 
he 
has 
at 
all 
weakened 
it. 
M. 
Bayle 
also 
is 
not 
quite 
satisfied 
with 
this 
accepted 
distinction. 
This 
is 
what 
he 
says 
on 
the 
matter 
(vol. 
III 
of 
the 
Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
ch. 
158). 
Firstly 
() 
he 
distinguishes, 
together 
with 
M. 
Saurin, 
between 
these 
two 
theses: 
the 
one, 
all 
the 
dogmas 
of 
Christianity 
are 
in 
conformity 
with 
reason; 
the 
other, 
human 
reason 
knows 
that 
they 
are 
in 
conformity 
with 
reason. 
He 
affirms 
the 
first 
and 
denies 
the 
second. 
I 
am 
of 
the 
same 
opinion, 
if 
in 
saying 
‘that 
a 
dogma 
conforms 
to 
reason’ 
one 
means 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
account 
for 
it 
or 
to 
explain 
its 
how 
by 
reason; 
for 
God 
could 
doubtless 
do 
so, 
and 
we 
cannot. 
But 
I 
think 
that 
one 
must 
affirm 
both 
theses 
if 
by 
‘knowing 
that 
a 
dogma 
conforms 
to 
reason’ 
one 
means 
that 
we 
can 
demonstrate, 
if 
need 
be, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
contradiction 
between 
this 
dogma 
and 
reason, 
repudiating 
the 
objectionsofthosewho 
maintainthat 
thisdogma 
isanabsurdity. 
61. 
M. 
Bayle 
explains 
himself 
here 
in 
a 
manner 
not 
at 
all 
convincing. 
He 
acknowledges 
fully 
that 
our 
Mysteries 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
supreme 
and 
universal 
reason 
that 
is 
in 
the 
divine 
understanding, 
or 
with 
reason 
in 
general; 
yet 
he 
denies 
that 
they 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
that 
part 
of 
reason 

which 
man 
employs 
to 
judge 
things. 
But 
this 
portion 
of 
reason 
which 
we 
possess 
is 
a 
gift 
of 
God, 
and 
consists 
in 
the 
natural 
light 
that 
has 
remained 
with 
us 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
corruption; 
thus 
it 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
whole, 
and 
it 
differs 
from 
that 
which 
is 
in 
God 
only 
as 
a 
drop 
of 
water 
differs 
from 
the 
ocean 
or 
rather 
as 
the 
finite 
from 
the 
infinite. 
Therefore 
Mysteries 
may 
transcend 
it, 
but 
they 
cannot 
be 
contrary 
to 
it. 
One 
cannot 
be 
contrary 
to 
one 
part 
without 
being 
contrary 
to 
the 
whole. 
That 
which 
contradicts 
a 
proposition 
of 
Euclid 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
Elements 
of 
Euclid. 
That 
which 
in 
us 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
Mysteries 
is 
not 
reason 
nor 
is 
it 
the 
natural 
light 
or 
the 
linkingtogetheroftruths;itiscorruption,orerror,orprejudice,or 
darkness. 


62. 
M. 
Bayle 
() 
is 
not 
satisfied 
with 
the 
opinion 
of 
Josua 
Stegman 
and 
of 
M. 
Turretin, 
Protestant 
theologians 
who 
teach 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
are 
contrary 
only 
to 
corrupt 
reason. 
He 
asks, 
mockingly, 
whether 
by 
right 
reason 
is 
meant 
perchance 
that 
of 
an 
orthodox 
theologian 
and 
by 
corrupt 
reason 
that 
of 
an 
heretic; 
and 
he 
urges 
the 
objection 
that 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
Mystery 
of 
the 
Trinity 
was 
no 
greater 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
Luther 
than 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
Socinius. 
But 
as 
M. 
Descartes 
has 
well 
observed, 
good 
sense 
is 
distributed 
to 
all: 
thus 
one 
must 
believe 
that 
both 
the 
orthodox 
and 
heretics 
are 
endowed 
therewith. 
Right 
reason 
is 
a 
linking 
together 
of 
truths, 
corrupt 
reason 
is 
mixed 
with 
prejudices 
and 
passions. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
discriminate 
between 
the 
two, 
one 
need 
but 
proceed 
in 
good 
order, 
admit 
no 
thesis 
without 
proof, 
and 
admit 
no 
proof 
unless 
it 
be 
in 
proper 
form, 
according 
to 
the 
commonest 
rules 
of 
logic. 
One 
needs 
neither 
any 
other 
criterion 
nor 
other 
arbitrator 
in 
questions 
of 
reason. 
It 
is 
only 
through 
lack 
of 
this 
consideration 
that 
a 
handle 
has 
been 
given 
to 
the 
sceptics, 
and 
that 
even 
in 
theology 
François 
Véron 
and 
some 
others, 
who 
exacerbated 
the 
dispute 
with 
the 
Protestants, 
even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
dishonesty, 
plunged 
headlong 
into 
scepticism 
in 
order 
to 
prove 
the 
necessity 
of 
accepting 
an 
infallible 
external 
judge. 
Their 
course 
meets 
with 
no 
approval 

from 
the 
most 
expert, 
even 
in 
their 
own 
party: 
Calixtus 
and 
Daillé 
derided 
it 
asitdeserved, 
andBellarmine 
arguedquiteotherwise. 


63. 
Now 
let 
us 
come 
to 
what 
M. 
Bayle 
says 
() 
on 
the 
distinction 
we 
are 
concerned 
with. 
‘It 
seems 
to 
me’, 
he 
says, 
‘that 
an 
ambiguity 
has 
crept 
into 
the 
celebrated 
distinction 
drawn 
between 
things 
that 
are 
above 
reason 
and 
things 
that 
are 
against 
reason. 
The 
Mysteries 
of 
the 
Gospel 
are 
above 
reason, 
so 
it 
is 
usually 
said, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
contrary 
to 
reason. 
I 
think 
that 
the 
same 
sense 
is 
not 
given 
to 
the 
word 
reason 
in 
the 
first 
part 
of 
this 
axiom 
as 
in 
the 
second: 
by 
the 
first 
is 
understood 
rather 
the 
reason 
of 
man, 
or 
reason 
in 
concreto 
and 
by 
the 
second 
reason 
in 
general, 
or 
reason 
in 
abstracto. 
For 
supposing 
that 
it 
is 
understood 
always 
as 
reason 
in 
general 
or 
the 
supreme 
reason, 
theuniversalreason 
that 
is 
in 
God, 
it 
is 
equally 
truethatthe 
Mysteries 
of 
the 
Gospels 
are 
not 
above 
reason 
and 
that 
they 
are 
not 
against 
reason. 
But 
if 
in 
both 
parts 
of 
the 
axiom 
human 
reason 
is 
meant, 
I 
do 
not 
clearly 
see 
the 
soundness 
of 
the 
distinction: 
for 
the 
most 
orthodox 
confess 
that 
we 
know 
not 
how 
our 
Mysteries 
can 
conform 
to 
the 
maxims 
of 
philosophy. 
It 
seems 
to 
us, 
therefore, 
that 
they 
are 
not 
in 
conformity 
with 
our 
reason. 
Now 
that 
which 
appears 
to 
us 
not 
to 
be 
in 
conformity 
with 
our 
reason 
appears 
contrary 
to 
our 
reason, 
just 
as 
that 
which 
appears 
to 
us 
not 
in 
conformity 
with 
truth 
appears 
contrary 
to 
truth. 
Thus 
why 
should 
not 
one 
say, 
equally, 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
are 
against 
our 
feeble 
reason, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
above 
our 
feeble 
reason?’ 
I 
answer, 
as 
I 
have 
done 
already, 
that 
‘reason’ 
here 
is 
the 
linking 
together 
of 
the 
truths 
that 
we 
know 
by 
the 
light 
of 
nature, 
and 
in 
this 
sense 
the 
axiom 
is 
true 
and 
without 
any 
ambiguity. 
The 
Mysteries 
transcend 
our 
reason, 
since 
they 
contain 
truths 
that 
are 
not 
comprised 
in 
this 
sequence; 
but 
they 
are 
not 
contrary 
to 
our 
reason, 
and 
they 
do 
not 
contradict 
any 
of 
the 
truths 
whereto 
this 
sequence 
can 
lead 
us. 
Accordingly 
there 
is 
no 
question 
here 
of 
the 
universal 
reason 
that 
is 
in 
God, 
but 
of 
our 
reason. 
As 
for 
the 
question 
whether 

we 
know 
the 
Mysteries 
to 
conform 
with 
our 
reason, 
I 
answer 
that 
at 
least 
we 
never 
know 
of 
any 
non-conformity 
or 
any 
opposition 
between 
the 
Mysteries 
and 
reason. 
Moreover, 
we 
can 
always 
abolish 
such 
alleged 
opposition, 
and 
so, 
if 
this 
can 
be 
called 
reconciling 
or 
harmonizing 
faith 
with 
reason, 
or 
recognizing 
the 
conformity 
between 
them, 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
we 
can 
recognize 
this 
conformity 
and 
this 
harmony. 
But 
if 
the 
conformity 
consists 
in 
a 
reasonableexplanationofthe 
how,wecannotrecognize 
it. 


64. 
M. 
Bayle 
makes 
one 
more 
ingenious 
objection, 
which 
he 
draws 
from 
the 
example 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
sight. 
‘When 
a 
square 
tower’, 
he 
says, 
‘from 
a 
distance 
appears 
to 
us 
round, 
our 
eyes 
testify 
very 
clearly 
not 
only 
that 
they 
perceive 
nothing 
square 
in 
this 
tower, 
but 
also 
that 
they 
discover 
there 
a 
round 
shape, 
incompatible 
with 
the 
square 
shape. 
One 
may 
therefore 
say 
that 
the 
truth 
which 
is 
the 
square 
shape 
is 
not 
only 
above, 
but 
even 
against, 
the 
witness 
of 
our 
feeble 
sight.’ 
It 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
this 
observation 
is 
correct, 
and 
although 
it 
be 
true 
that 
the 
appearance 
of 
roundness 
comes 
simply 
from 
the 
effacement 
of 
the 
angles,which 
distance 
causes 
to 
disappear, 
it 
is 
true, 
notwithstanding, 
that 
the 
round 
and 
the 
square 
are 
opposites. 
Therefore 
my 
answer 
to 
this 
objection 
is 
that 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
senses, 
even 
when 
they 
do 
all 
that 
in 
them 
lies, 
is 
often 
contrary 
to 
the 
truth; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
the 
faculty 
of 
reasoning, 
when 
it 
does 
its 
duty, 
since 
a 
strictly 
reasoned 
argument 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
linking 
together 
of 
truths. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
sense 
of 
sight 
in 
particular, 
it 
is 
well 
to 
consider 
that 
there 
are 
yet 
other 
false 
appearances 
which 
come 
not 
from 
the 
‘feebleness 
of 
our 
eyes’ 
nor 
from 
the 
loss 
of 
visibility 
brought 
about 
by 
distance, 
but 
from 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
vision, 
however 
perfect 
it 
be. 
It 
is 
thus, 
for 
instance, 
that 
the 
circle 
seen 
sideways 
is 
changed 
into 
that 
kind 
of 
oval 
which 
among 
geometricians 
is 
known 
as 
an 
ellipse, 
and 
sometimes 
even 
into 
a 
parabola 
or 
a 
hyperbola, 
or 
actually 
intoastraightline, 
witnessthe 
ringof 
Saturn. 

65. 
The 
external 
senses, 
properly 
speaking, 
do 
not 
deceive 
us. 
It 
is 
our 
inner 
sense 
which 
often 
makes 
us 
go 
too 
fast. 
That 
occurs 
also 
in 
brute 
beasts, 
as 
when 
a 
dog 
barks 
at 
his 
reflexion 
in 
the 
mirror: 
for 
beasts 
have 
consecutions 
of 
perception 
which 
resemble 
reasoning, 
and 
which 
occur 
also 
in 
the 
inner 
sense 
of 
men, 
when 
their 
actions 
have 
only 
an 
empirical 
quality. 
But 
beasts 
do 
nothing 
which 
compels 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
they 
have 
what 
deserves 
to 
be 
properly 
called 
a 
reasoning 
sense, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere. 
Now 
when 
the 
understanding 
uses 
and 
follows 
the 
false 
decision 
of 
the 
inner 
sense 
(as 
when 
the 
famous 
Galileo 
thought 
that 
Saturn 
had 
two 
handles) 
it 
is 
deceived 
by 
the 
judgement 
it 
makes 
upon 
the 
effect 
of 
appearances, 
and 
it 
infers 
from 
them 
more 
than 
they 
imply. 
For 
the 
appearances 
of 
the 
senses 
do 
not 
promise 
us 
absolutely 
the 
truth 
of 
things, 
any 
more 
than 
dreams 
do. 
It 
is 
we 
who 
deceive 
ourselves 
by 
the 
use 
we 
make 
of 
them, 
that 
is, 
by 
our 
consecutions. 
Indeed 
we 
allow 
ourselves 
to 
be 
deluded 
by 
probable 
arguments, 
and 
we 
are 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
phenomena 
such 
as 
we 
have 
found 
linked 
together 
often 
are 
so 
always. 
Thus, 
as 
it 
happens 
usually 
that 
that 
which 
appears 
without 
angles 
has 
none, 
we 
readily 
believe 
it 
to 
be 
always 
thus. 
Such 
an 
error 
is 
pardonable, 
and 
sometimes 
inevitable, 
when 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
act 
promptly 
and 
choose 
that 
which 
appearances 
recommend; 
but 
when 
we 
have 
the 
leisure 
and 
the 
time 
to 
collect 
our 
thoughts, 
we 
are 
in 
fault 
if 
we 
take 
for 
certain 
that 
which 
is 
not 
so. 
It 
is 
therefore 
true 
that 
appearances 
are 
often 
contrary 
to 
truth, 
but 
our 
reasoning 
never 
is 
when 
it 
proceeds 
strictly 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
art 
of 
reasoning. 
If 
by 
reason 
one 
meant 
generally 
the 
faculty 
of 
reasoning 
whether 
well 
or 
ill, 
I 
confess 
that 
it 
might 
deceive 
us, 
and 
does 
indeed 
deceive 
us, 
and 
the 
appearances 
of 
our 
understanding 
are 
often 
as 
deceptive 
as 
those 
of 
the 
senses: 
but 
here 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
the 
linking 
together 
of 
truths 
and 
of 
objections 
in 
due 
form, 
and 
in 
this 
sense 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
reason 
to 
deceive 

us. 


66. 
Thus 
it 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
all 
I 
have 
just 
said 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
carries 
too 
far 
the 
being 
above 
reason, 
as 
if 
it 
included 
the 
insoluble 
nature 
of 
objections: 
for 
according 
to 
him 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial,vol. 
III, 
ch. 
130, 
) 
‘once 
a 
dogma 
is 
above 
reason, 
philosophy 
can 
neither 
explain 
it 
nor 
comprehend 
it, 
nor 
meet 
the 
difficulties 
that 
are 
urged 
against 
it’. 
I 
agree 
with 
regard 
to 
comprehension, 
but 
I 
have 
already 
shown 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
receive 
a 
necessary 
verbal 
explanation, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
the 
terms 
employed 
be 
not 
sine 
mente 
soni, 
words 
signifying 
nothing. 
I 
have 
shown 
also 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
one 
to 
be 
capable 
of 
answering 
the 
objections, 
and 
that 
otherwise 
onemustneedsrejectthethesis. 
67. 
He 
adduces 
the 
authority 
of 
theologians, 
who 
appear 
to 
recognize 
the 
insoluble 
nature 
of 
the 
objections 
against 
the 
Mysteries. 
Luther 
is 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
of 
these; 
but 
I 
have 
already 
replied, 
in 
§ 
12, 
to 
the 
passage 
where 
he 
seems 
to 
say 
that 
philosophy 
contradicts 
theology. 
There 
is 
another 
passage 
(De 
Servo 
Arbitrio, 
ch. 
246) 
where 
he 
says 
that 
the 
apparent 
injustice 
of 
God 
is 
proved 
by 
arguments 
taken 
from 
the 
adversity 
of 
good 
people 
and 
the 
prosperity 
of 
the 
wicked, 
an 
argument 
irresistible 
both 
for 
all 
reason 
and 
for 
natural 
intelligence 
(‘Argumentis 
talibus 
traducta, 
quibus 
nulla 
ratio 
aut 
lumen 
naturae 
potest 
resistere’). 
But 
soon 
afterwards 
he 
shows 
that 
he 
means 
it 
only 
of 
those 
who 
know 
nothing 
of 
the 
life 
to 
come, 
since 
he 
adds 
that 
an 
expression 
in 
the 
Gospel 
dissipates 
this 
difficulty, 
teaching 
us 
that 
there 
is 
another 
life, 
where 
that 
which 
has 
not 
been 
punished 
and 
rewarded 
in 
this 
life 
shall 
receive 
its 
due. 
The 
objection 
is 
then 
far 
from 
being 
insuperable, 
and 
even 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
Gospel 
one 
could 
bethink 
oneself 
of 
this 
answer. 
There 
is 
also 
quoted 
(Reply, 
vol. 
III, 
) 
a 
passage 
from 
Martin 
Chemnitz, 
criticized 
by 
Vedelius 
and 
defended 
by 
Johann 
Musaeus, 
where 
this 
famous 
theologian 
seems 
to 
say 
clearly 
that 
there 
are 
truths 
in 
the 
word 
of 
God 
which 

are 
not 
only 
above 
reason 
but 
also 
against 
reason. 
But 
this 
passage 
must 
be 
taken 
as 
referring 
only 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
reason 
that 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
theorderofNature, 
asMusaeus 
alsointerpretsit. 


68. 
It 
is 
true 
nevertheless 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
finds 
some 
authorities 
who 
are 
more 
favourable 
to 
him, 
M. 
Descartes 
being 
one 
of 
the 
chief. 
This 
great 
man 
says 
positively 
(Part 
I 
of 
his 
Principles, 
art. 
41) 
‘that 
we 
shall 
have 
not 
the 
slightest 
trouble 
in 
ridding 
ourselves 
of 
the 
difficulty’ 
(which 
one 
may 
have 
in 
harmonizing 
the 
freedom 
of 
our 
will 
with 
the 
order 
of 
the 
eternal 
providence 
of 
God) 
‘if 
we 
observe 
that 
our 
thought 
is 
finite, 
and 
that 
the 
Knowledge 
and 
the 
Omnipotence 
of 
God, 
whereby 
he 
has 
not 
only 
known 
from 
all 
eternity 
all 
that 
which 
is 
or 
which 
can 
be, 
but 
also 
has 
willed 
it, 
is 
infinite. 
We 
have 
therefore 
quite 
enough 
intelligence 
to 
recognize 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
that 
this 
knowledge 
and 
this 
power 
are 
in 
God; 
but 
we 
have 
not 
enough 
so 
to 
comprehend 
their 
scope 
that 
we 
can 
know 
how 
they 
leave 
the 
actions 
of 
men 
entirely 
free 
and 
undetermined. 
Yet 
the 
Power 
and 
the 
Knowledge 
of 
God 
must 
not 
prevent 
us 
from 
believing 
that 
we 
have 
a 
free 
will; 
for 
we 
should 
be 
wrong 
to 
doubt 
of 
that 
whereof 
we 
are 
inwardly 
conscious, 
and 
which 
we 
know 
by 
experience 
to 
be 
within 
us, 
simply 
because 
we 
do 
not 
comprehend 
some 
other 
thing 
which 
we 
know 
to 
be 
incomprehensible 
initsnature.’ 
69. 
This 
passage 
from 
M. 
Descartes, 
followed 
by 
his 
adherents 
(who 
rarely 
think 
of 
doubting 
what 
he 
asserts), 
has 
always 
appeared 
strange 
to 
me. 
Not 
content 
with 
saying 
that, 
as 
for 
him, 
he 
sees 
no 
way 
of 
reconciling 
the 
two 
dogmas, 
he 
puts 
the 
whole 
human 
race, 
and 
even 
all 
rational 
creatures, 
in 
the 
same 
case. 
Yet 
could 
he 
have 
been 
unaware 
that 
there 
is 
no 
possibility 
of 
an 
insuperable 
objection 
against 
truth? 
For 
such 
an 
objection 
could 
only 
be 
a 
necessary 
linking 
together 
of 
other 
truths 
whose 
result 
would 
be 
contrary 
to 
the 
truth 
that 
one 
maintains; 
and 
consequently 
there 
would 
be 
contradiction 

between 
the 
truths, 
which 
would 
be 
an 
utter 
absurdity. 
Moreover, 
albeit 
our 
mind 
is 
finite 
and 
cannot 
comprehend 
the 
infinite, 
of 
the 
infinite 
nevertheless 
it 
has 
proofs 
whose 
strength 
or 
weakness 
it 
comprehends; 
why 
then 
should 
it 
not 
have 
the 
same 
comprehension 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
objections? 
And 
since 
the 
power 
and 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
are 
infinite 
and 
comprehend 
everything, 
there 
is 
no 
pretext 
for 
doubting 
their 
scope. 
Further, 
M. 
Descartes 
demands 
a 
freedom 
which 
is 
not 
needed, 
by 
his 
insistence 
that 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
will 
of 
man 
are 
altogether 
undetermined, 
a 
thing 
which 
never 
happens. 
Finally, 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
maintains 
that 
this 
experience 
or 
this 
inward 
sense 
of 
our 
independence, 
upon 
which 
M. 
Descartes 
founds 
the 
proof 
of 
our 
freedom, 
does 
not 
prove 
it: 
for 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
of 
the 
causes 
whereon 
we 
depend, 
it 
does 
not 
follow, 
according 
to 
M. 
Bayle, 
that 
we 
are 
independent. 
Butthat 
issomethingwewillspeakof 
initsproper 
place. 


70. 
It 
seems 
that 
M. 
Descartes 
confesses 
also, 
in 
a 
passage 
of 
his 
Principles, 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
find 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
difficulties 
on 
the 
division 
of 
matter 
to 
infinity, 
which 
he 
nevertheless 
recognizes 
as 
actual. 
Arriaga 
and 
other 
Schoolmen 
make 
well-nigh 
the 
same 
confession: 
but 
if 
they 
took 
the 
trouble 
to 
give 
to 
the 
objections 
the 
form 
these 
ought 
to 
have, 
they 
would 
see 
that 
there 
are 
faults 
in 
the 
reasoning, 
and 
sometimes 
false 
assumptions 
which 
cause 
confusion. 
Here 
is 
an 
example. 
A 
man 
of 
parts 
one 
day 
brought 
up 
to 
me 
an 
objection 
in 
the 
following 
form: 
Let 
the 
straight 
line 
BA 
be 
cut 
in 
two 
equal 
parts 
at 
the 
point 
C, 
and 
the 
part 
CA 
at 
the 
point 
D, 
and 
the 
part 
DA 
at 
the 
point 
E, 
and 
so 
on 
to 
infinity; 
all 
the 
halves, 
BC, 
CD, 
DE, 
etc. 
together 
make 
the 
whole 
BA; 
therefore 
there 
must 
be 
a 
last 
half, 
sincethestraightlineBAfinishesatA. 
Butthis 
lasthalfisabsurd:forsinceit 
is 
a 
line, 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
again 
to 
cut 
it 
in 
two. 
Therefore 
division 
to 
infinity 
cannot 
be 
admitted. 
But 
I 
pointed 
out 
to 
him 
that 
one 
is 
not 
justified 
in 
the 
inference 
that 
there 
must 
be 
a 
last 
half, 
although 
there 
be 
a 
last 
point 
A, 

for 
this 
last 
point 
belongs 
to 
all 
the 
halves 
of 
its 
side. 
And 
my 
friend 
acknowledged 
it 
himself 
when 
he 
endeavoured 
to 
prove 
this 
deduction 
by 
a 
formal 
argument; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
just 
because 
the 
division 
goes 
on 
to 
infinity, 
there 
is 
no 
last 
half. 
And 
although 
the 
straight 
line 
AB 
be 
finite, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
the 
process 
of 
dividing 
it 
has 
any 
final 
end. 
The 
same 
confusion 
arises 
with 
the 
series 
of 
numbers 
going 
on 
to 
infinity. 
One 
imagines 
a 
final 
end, 
a 
number 
that 
is 
infinite, 
or 
infinitely 
small; 
but 
that 
is 
all 
simple 
fiction. 
Every 
number 
is 
finite 
and 
specific; 
every 
line 
is 
so 
likewise, 
and 
the 
infinite 
or 
infinitely 
small 
signify 
only 
magnitudes 
that 
one 
may 
take 
as 
great 
or 
as 
small 
as 
one 
wishes, 
to 
show 
that 
an 
error 
is 
smaller 
than 
that 
which 
has 
been 
specified, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
error; 
or 
else 
by 
the 
infinitely 
small 
is 
meant 
the 
state 
of 
a 
magnitude 
at 
its 
vanishing 
point 
orits 
beginning,conceived 
after 
the 
pattern 
ofmagnitudesalreadyactualized. 


71. 
It 
will, 
however, 
be 
well 
to 
consider 
the 
argument 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
puts 
forward 
to 
show 
that 
one 
cannot 
refute 
the 
objections 
which 
reason 
opposes 
to 
the 
Mysteries. 
It 
is 
in 
his 
comment 
on 
the 
Manichaeans 
( 
of 
the 
second 
edition 
of 
his 
Dictionary). 
‘It 
is 
enough 
for 
me’, 
he 
says, 
‘that 
it 
be 
unanimously 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
Mysteries 
of 
the 
Gospel 
are 
above 
reason. 
For 
thence 
comes 
the 
necessary 
conclusion 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
settle 
the 
difficulties 
raised 
by 
the 
philosophers, 
and 
in 
consequence 
that 
a 
dispute 
where 
only 
the 
light 
of 
Nature 
is 
followed 
will 
always 
end 
unfavourably 
for 
the 
theologians, 
and 
that 
they 
will 
see 
themselves 
forced 
to 
give 
way 
and 
to 
take 
refuge 
in 
the 
canon 
of 
the 
supernatural 
light.’ 
I 
am 
surprised 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
speaks 
in 
such 
general 
terms, 
since 
he 
has 
acknowledged 
himself 
that 
the 
light 
of 
Nature 
is 
against 
the 
Manichaeans, 
and 
for 
the 
oneness 
of 
the 
Principle, 
and 
that 
the 
goodness 
of 
God 
is 
proved 
incontrovertiblybyreason. 
Yetthisishow 
hecontinues: 

72. 
‘It 
isevidentthatreasoncannever 
attaintothatwhichisaboveit. 
Now 
if 
it 
could 
supply 
answers 
to 
the 
objections 
which 
are 
opposed 
to 
the 
dogma 
of 
the 
Trinity 
and 
that 
of 
hypostatic 
union, 
it 
would 
attain 
to 
those 
two 
Mysteries, 
it 
would 
have 
them 
in 
subjection 
and 
submit 
them 
to 
the 
strictest 
examination 
by 
comparison 
with 
its 
first 
principles, 
or 
with 
the 
aphorisms 
that 
spring 
from 
common 
notions, 
and 
proceed 
until 
finally 
it 
had 
drawn 
the 
conclusion 
that 
they 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
natural 
light. 
It 
would 
therefore 
do 
what 
exceeds 
its 
powers, 
it 
would 
soar 
above 
its 
confines, 
and 
that 
is 
a 
formal 
contradiction. 
One 
must 
therefore 
say 
that 
it 
cannot 
provide 
answers 
to 
its 
own 
objections, 
and 
that 
thus 
they 
remain 
victorious, 
so 
long 
as 
one 
does 
not 
have 
recourse 
to 
the 
authority 
of 
God 
and 
to 
the 
necessity 
of 
subjugating 
one’s 
understanding 
to 
the 
obedience 
of 
faith.’ 
I 
do 
not 
find 
that 
there 
is 
any 
force 
in 
this 
reasoning. 
We 
can 
attain 
to 
that 
which 
is 
above 
us 
not 
by 
penetrating 
it 
but 
by 
maintaining 
it; 
as 
we 
can 
attain 
to 
the 
sky 
by 
sight, 
and 
not 
by 
touch. 
Nor 
is 
it 
necessary 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
answer 
the 
objections 
which 
are 
made 
against 
the 
Mysteries, 
one 
should 
have 
them 
in 
subjection 
to 
oneself, 
and 
submit 
them 
to 
examination 
by 
comparison 
with 
the 
first 
principles 
that 
spring 
from 
common 
notions. 
For 
if 
he 
who 
answers 
the 
objections 
had 
to 
go 
so 
far, 
he 
who 
proposes 
the 
objections 
needs 
must 
do 
it 
first. 
It 
is 
the 
part 
of 
the 
objection 
to 
open 
up 
the 
subject, 
and 
it 
is 
enough 
for 
him 
who 
answers 
to 
say 
Yes 
or 
No. 
He 
is 
not 
obliged 
to 
counter 
with 
a 
distinction: 
it 
will 
do, 
in 
case 
of 
need, 
if 
he 
denies 
the 
universality 
of 
some 
proposition 
in 
the 
objection 
or 
criticizes 
its 
form, 
and 
one 
may 
do 
both 
these 
things 
without 
penetrating 
beyond 
the 
objection. 
When 
someone 
offers 
me 
a 
proof 
which 
he 
maintains 
is 
invincible, 
I 
can 
keep 
silence 
while 
I 
compel 
him 
merely 
to 
prove 
in 
due 
form 
all 
the 
enunciations 
that 
he 
brings 
forward, 
and 
such 
as 
appear 
to 
me 
in 
the 
slightest 
degree 
doubtful. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
doubting 
only, 
I 
need 
not 
at 
all 
probe 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
matter; 
on 
the 

contrary, 
the 
more 
ignorant 
I 
am 
the 
more 
shall 
I 
be 
justified 
in 
doubting. 
M. 
Bayle 
continuesthus: 


73. 
‘Let 
us 
endeavour 
to 
clarify 
that. 
If 
some 
doctrines 
are 
above 
reason 
they 
are 
beyond 
its 
reach, 
it 
cannot 
attain 
to 
them; 
if 
it 
cannot 
attain 
to 
them, 
it 
cannot 
comprehend 
them.’ 
(He 
could 
have 
begun 
here 
with 
the 
‘comprehend’, 
saying 
that 
reason 
cannot 
comprehend 
that 
which 
is 
above 
it.) 
‘If 
it 
cannot 
comprehend 
them, 
it 
can 
find 
in 
them 
no 
idea’ 
(Non 
valet 
consequentia: 
for, 
to 
‘comprehend’ 
something, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
that 
one 
have 
some 
ideas 
thereof; 
one 
must 
have 
all 
the 
ideas 
of 
everything 
that 
goes 
to 
make 
it 
up, 
and 
all 
these 
ideas 
must 
be 
clear, 
distinct, 
adequate. 
There 
are 
a 
thousand 
objects 
in 
Nature 
in 
which 
we 
understand 
something, 
but 
which 
we 
do 
not 
therefore 
necessarily 
comprehend. 
We 
have 
some 
ideas 
on 
the 
rays 
of 
light, 
we 
demonstrate 
upon 
them 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point; 
but 
there 
ever 
remains 
something 
which 
makes 
us 
confess 
that 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
comprehend 
the 
whole 
nature 
of 
light.) 
‘nor 
any 
principle 
such 
as 
may 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
solution;’ 
(Why 
should 
not 
evident 
principles 
be 
found 
mingled 
with 
obscure 
and 
confused 
knowledge?) 
‘and 
consequently 
the 
objections 
that 
reason 
has 
made 
will 
remain 
unanswered;’ 
(By 
no 
means; 
the 
difficulty 
is 
rather 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
opposer. 
It 
is 
for 
him 
to 
seek 
an 
evident 
principle 
such 
as 
may 
give 
rise 
to 
some 
objection; 
and 
the 
more 
obscure 
the 
subject, 
the 
more 
trouble 
he 
will 
have 
in 
finding 
such 
a 
principle. 
Moreover, 
when 
he 
has 
found 
it 
he 
will 
have 
still 
more 
trouble 
in 
demonstrating 
an 
opposition 
between 
the 
principle 
and 
the 
Mystery: 
for, 
if 
it 
happened 
that 
the 
Mystery 
was 
evidently 
contrary 
to 
an 
evident 
principle, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
an 
obscure 
Mystery, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
manifest 
absurdity.) 
‘or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
answer 
will 
be 
made 
with 
some 
distinction 
as 
obscure 
as 
the 
very 
thesis 
that 
will 
have 
been 
attacked.’

can 
do 
without

need

74. 
‘Now 
it 
is 
certain’, 
so 
M. 
Bayle 
founded 
on 
distinct 
notions 
remains 
equ 
no 
answer, 
or

an

Finally, 
when 
I 
am 
so 
oblig

it

that

Thus 
something

ESSAYS 
ON 
THE 
JUSTICEOF 
GOD 
AND 
THE 
FREEDOM 
OF 
MAN 
IN 
THE 
ORIGIN 
OF 
EVIL 




PART 
ONE 



1. 
HAVING 
SO 
settled 
the 
rights 
of 
faith 
and 
of 
reason 
as 
rather 
to 
place 
reason 
at 
the 
service 
of 
faith 
than 
in 
opposition 
to 
it, 
we 
shall 
see 
how 
they 
exercise 
these 
rights 
to 
support 
and 
harmonize 
what 
the 
light 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
light 
of 
revelation 
teach 
us 
of 
God 
and 
of 
man 
in 
relation 
to 
evil. 
The 
difficulties 
are 
distinguishable 
into 
two 
classes. 
The 
one 
kind 
springs 
from 
man’s 
freedom, 
which 
appears 
incompatible 
with 
the 
divine 
nature; 
and 
nevertheless 
freedom 
is 
deemed 
necessary, 
in 
order 
that 
man 
may 
be 
deemed 
guilty 
and 
open 
to 
punishment. 
The 
other 
kind 
concerns 
the 
conduct 
of 
God, 
and 
seems 
to 
make 
him 
participate 
too 
much 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
evil, 
even 
though 
man 
be 
free 
and 
participate 
also 
therein. 
And 
this 
conduct 
appears 
contrary 
to 
the 
goodness, 
the 
holiness 
and 
the 
justice 
of 
God, 
since 
God 
cooperates 
in 
evil 
as 
well 
physical 
as 
moral, 
and 
co-operates 
in 
each 
of 
them 
both 
morally 
and 
physically; 
and 
since 
it 
seems 
that 
these 
evils 
are 
manifested 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature 
as 
well 
as 
in 
that 
of 
grace, 
and 
in 
the 
future 
and 
eternallifeaswellas, 
nay, 
more 
than,in 
thistransitorylife. 
2. 
To 
present 
these 
difficulties 
in 
brief, 
it 
must 
be 
observed 
that 
freedom 
is 
opposed, 
to 
all 
appearance, 
by 
determination 
or 
certainty 
of 
any 
kind 
whatever; 
and 
nevertheless 
the 
common 
dogma 
of 
our 
philosophers 
states 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
contingent 
futurities 
is 
determined. 
The 
foreknowledge 
of 
God 
renders 
all 
the 
future 
certain 
and 
determined, 
but 
his 
providence 
and 
his 
foreordinance, 
whereon 
foreknowledge 
itself 
appears 
founded, 
do 
much 
more: 
for 
God 
is 
not 
as 
a 
man, 
able 
to 
look 
upon 
events 
with 
unconcern 
and 
to 
suspend 
his 
judgement, 
since 
nothing 
exists 
save 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
decrees 
of 
his 
will 
and 
through 
the 
action 
of 
his 
power. 
And 
even 
though 
one 
leave 
out 
of 
account 
the 
co-operation 
of 
God, 
all 
is 
perfectly 
connected 
in 
the 
order 

of 
things, 
since 
nothing 
can 
come 
to 
pass 
unless 
there 
be 
a 
cause 
so 
disposed 
as 
to 
produce 
the 
effect, 
this 
taking 
place 
no 
less 
in 
voluntary 
than 
in 
all 
other 
actions. 
According 
to 
which 
it 
appears 
that 
man 
is 
compelled 
to 
do 
the 
good 
and 
evil 
that 
he 
does, 
and 
in 
consequence 
that 
he 
deserves 
therefor 
neither 
recompense 
nor 
chastisement: 
thus 
is 
the 
morality 
of 
actions 
destroyed 
and 
alljustice, 
divineandhuman, 
shaken. 


3. 
But 
even 
though 
one 
should 
grant 
to 
man 
this 
freedom 
wherewith 
he 
arrays 
himself 
to 
his 
own 
hurt, 
the 
conduct 
of 
God 
could 
not 
but 
provide 
matter 
for 
a 
criticism 
supported 
by 
the 
presumptuous 
ignorance 
of 
men, 
who 
would 
wish 
to 
exculpate 
themselves 
wholly 
or 
in 
part 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
God. 
It 
is 
objected 
that 
all 
the 
reality 
and 
what 
is 
termed 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
act 
in 
sinitselfis 
aproductionofGod,sinceallcreaturesandalltheiractionsderive 
from 
him 
that 
reality 
they 
have. 
Whence 
one 
could 
infer 
not 
only 
that 
he 
is 
the 
physical 
cause 
of 
sin, 
but 
also 
that 
he 
is 
its 
moral 
cause, 
since 
he 
acts 
with 
perfect 
freedom 
and 
does 
nothing 
without 
a 
complete 
knowledge 
of 
the 
thing 
and 
the 
consequences 
that 
it 
may 
have. 
Nor 
is 
it 
enough 
to 
say 
that 
God 
has 
made 
for 
himself 
a 
law 
to 
co-operate 
with 
the 
wills 
or 
resolutions 
of 
man, 
whether 
we 
express 
ourselves 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
common 
opinion 
or 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes. 
Not 
only 
will 
it 
be 
found 
strange 
that 
he 
should 
have 
made 
such 
a 
law 
for 
himself, 
of 
whose 
results 
he 
was 
not 
ignorant, 
but 
the 
principal 
difficulty 
is 
that 
it 
seems 
the 
evil 
will 
itself 
cannot 
exist 
without 
co-operation, 
and 
even 
without 
some 
predetermination, 
on 
his 
part, 
which 
contributes 
towards 
begetting 
this 
will 
in 
man 
or 
in 
some 
other 
rational 
creature. 
For 
an 
action 
is 
not, 
for 
being 
evil, 
the 
less 
dependent 
on 
God. 
Whence 
one 
will 
come 
at 
last 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
God 
does 
all, 
the 
good 
and 
the 
evil, 
indifferently; 
unless 
one 
pretend 
with 
the 
Manichaeans 
that 
therearetwoprinciples, 
theonegoodandtheotherevil. 
Moreover,according 
to 
the 
general 
opinion 
of 
theologians 
and 
philosophers, 
conservation 
being 
a 

perpetual 
creation, 
it 
will 
be 
said 
that 
man 
is 
perpetually 
created 
corrupt 
and 
erring. 
There 
are, 
furthermore, 
modern 
Cartesians 
who 
claim 
that 
God 
is 
the 
sole 
agent, 
of 
whom 
created 
beings 
are 
only 
the 
purely 
passive 
organs; 
and 


M. 
Baylebuildsnota 
little 
uponthat 
idea. 
4. 
But 
even 
granting 
that 
God 
should 
co-operate 
in 
actions 
only 
with 
a 
general 
co-operation, 
or 
even 
not 
at 
all, 
at 
least 
in 
those 
that 
are 
bad, 
it 
suffices, 
so 
it 
is 
said, 
to 
inculpate 
him 
and 
to 
render 
him 
the 
moral 
cause 
that 
nothing 
comes 
to 
pass 
without 
his 
permission. 
To 
say 
nothing 
of 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
angels, 
he 
knows 
all 
that 
which 
will 
come 
to 
pass, 
if, 
having 
created 
man, 
he 
places 
him 
in 
such 
and 
such 
circumstances; 
and 
he 
places 
him 
there 
notwithstanding. 
Man 
is 
exposed 
to 
a 
temptation 
to 
which 
it 
is 
known 
that 
he 
will 
succumb, 
thereby 
causing 
an 
infinitude 
of 
frightful 
evils, 
by 
which 
the 
whole 
human 
race 
will 
be 
infected 
and 
brought 
as 
it 
were 
into 
a 
necessity 
of 
sinning, 
a 
state 
which 
is 
named 
‘original 
sin’. 
Thus 
the 
world 
will 
be 
brought 
into 
a 
strange 
confusion, 
by 
this 
means 
death 
and 
diseases 
being 
introduced, 
with 
a 
thousand 
other 
misfortunes 
and 
miseries 
that 
in 
general 
afflict 
the 
good 
and 
the 
bad; 
wickedness 
will 
even 
hold 
sway 
and 
virtue 
will 
be 
oppressed 
on 
earth, 
so 
that 
it 
will 
scarce 
appear 
that 
a 
providence 
governs 
affairs. 
But 
it 
is 
much 
worse 
when 
one 
considers 
the 
life 
to 
come, 
since 
but 
a 
small 
number 
of 
men 
will 
be 
saved 
and 
since 
all 
the 
rest 
will 
perish 
eternally. 
Furthermore 
these 
men 
destined 
for 
salvation 
will 
have 
been 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
corrupt 
mass 
through 
an 
unreasoning 
election, 
whether 
it 
be 
said 
that 
God 
in 
choosing 
them 
has 
had 
regard 
to 
their 
future 
actions, 
to 
their 
faith 
or 
to 
their 
works, 
or 
one 
claim 
that 
he 
has 
been 
pleased 
to 
give 
them 
these 
good 
qualities 
and 
these 
actions 
because 
he 
has 
predestined 
them 
to 
salvation. 
For 
though 
it 
be 
said 
in 
the 
most 
lenient 
system 
that 
God 
wished 
to 
save 
all 
men, 
and 
though 
in 
the 
other 
systems 
commonly 
accepted 
it 
be 
granted, 
that 
he 
has 
made 
his 
Son 
take 
human 
nature 
upon 
him 
to 
expiate 
their 
sins, 
so 
that 
all 

they 
who 
shall 
believe 
in 
him 
with 
a 
lively 
and 
final 
faith 
shall 
be 
saved, 
it 
still 
remains 
true 
that 
this 
lively 
faith 
is 
a 
gift 
of 
God; 
that 
we 
are 
dead 
to 
all 
good 
works; 
that 
even 
our 
will 
itself 
must 
be 
aroused 
by 
a 
prevenient 
grace, 
and 
that 
God 
gives 
us 
the 
power 
to 
will 
and 
to 
do. 
And 
whether 
that 
be 
done 
through 
a 
grace 
efficacious 
of 
itself, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
through 
a 
divine 
inward 
motion 
which 
wholly 
determines 
our 
will 
to 
the 
good 
that 
it 
does; 
or 
whether 
there 
be 
only 
a 
sufficient 
grace, 
but 
such 
as 
does 
not 
fail 
to 
attain 
its 
end, 
and 
to 
become 
efficacious 
in 
the 
inward 
and 
outward 
circumstances 
wherein 
the 
man 
is 
and 
has 
been 
placed 
by 
God: 
one 
must 
return 
to 
the 
same 
conclusion 
that 
God 
is 
the 
final 
reason 
of 
salvation, 
of 
grace, 
of 
faith 
and 
of 
election 
in 
Jesus 
Christ. 
And 
be 
the 
election 
the 
cause 
or 
the 
result 
of 
God’s 
design 
to 
give 
faith, 
it 
still 
remains 
true 
that 
he 
gives 
faith 
or 
salvation 
to 
whom 
he 
pleases, 
without 
any 
discernible 
reason 
for 
his 
choice, 
which 
falls 
upon 
but 
few 
men. 


5. 
So 
it 
is 
a 
terrible 
judgement 
that 
God, 
giving 
his 
only 
Son 
for 
the 
whole 
human 
race 
and 
being 
the 
sole 
author 
and 
master 
of 
the 
salvation 
of 
men, 
yet 
saves 
so 
few 
of 
them 
and 
abandons 
all 
others 
to 
the 
devil 
his 
enemy, 
who 
torments 
them 
eternally 
and 
makes 
them 
curse 
their 
Creator, 
though 
they 
have 
all 
been 
created 
to 
diffuse 
and 
show 
forth 
his 
goodness, 
his 
justice 
and 
his 
other 
perfections. 
And 
this 
outcome 
inspires 
all 
the 
more 
horror, 
as 
the 
sole 
cause 
why 
all 
these 
men 
are 
wretched 
to 
all 
eternity 
is 
God’s 
having 
exposed 
their 
parents 
to 
a 
temptation 
that 
he 
knew 
they 
would 
not 
resist; 
as 
this 
sin 
is 
inherent 
and 
imputed 
to 
men 
before 
their 
will 
has 
participated 
in 
it; 
as 
this 
hereditary 
vice 
impels 
their 
will 
to 
commit 
actual 
sins; 
and 
as 
countless 
men, 
in 
childhood 
or 
maturity, 
that 
have 
never 
heard 
or 
have 
not 
heard 
enough 
of 
Jesus 
Christ, 
Saviour 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
die 
before 
receiving 
the 
necessary 
succour 
for 
their 
withdrawal 
from 
this 
abyss 
of 
sin. 
These 
men 
too 
are 
condemned 
to 
be 
for 
ever 
rebellious 
against 
God 
and 
plunged 
in 
the 

most 
horrible 
miseries, 
with 
the 
wickedest 
of 
all 
creatures, 
though 
in 
essence 
they 
have 
not 
been 
more 
wicked 
than 
others, 
and 
several 
among 
them 
have 
perchance 
been 
less 
guilty 
than 
some 
of 
that 
little 
number 
of 
elect, 
who 
were 
saved 
by 
a 
grace 
without 
reason, 
and 
who 
thereby 
enjoy 
an 
eternal 
felicity 
which 
they 
had 
not 
deserved. 
Such 
in 
brief 
are 
the 
difficulties 
touched 
upon 
by 
sundry 
persons; 
but 
M. 
Bayle 
was 
one 
who 
insisted 
on 
them 
the 
most, 
as 
will 
appear 
subsequently 
when 
we 
examine 
his 
passages. 
I 
think 
that 
now 
I 
have 
recorded 
the 
main 
essence 
of 
these 
difficulties: 
but 
I 
have 
deemed 
it 
fitting 
to 
refrain 
from 
some 
expressions 
and 
exaggerations 
which 
might 
have 
causedoffence,whilenotrenderingtheobjectionsany 
stronger. 


6. 
Let 
us 
now 
turn 
the 
medal 
and 
let 
us 
also 
point 
out 
what 
can 
be 
said 
in 
answer 
to 
those 
objections; 
and 
here 
a 
course 
of 
explanation 
through 
fuller 
dissertation 
will 
be 
necessary: 
for 
many 
difficulties 
can 
be 
opened 
up 
in 
few 
words, 
but 
for 
their 
discussion 
one 
must 
dilate 
upon 
them. 
Our 
end 
is 
to 
banish 
from 
men 
the 
false 
ideas 
that 
represent 
God 
to 
them 
as 
an 
absolute 
prince 
employing 
a 
despotic 
power, 
unfitted 
to 
be 
loved 
and 
unworthy 
of 
being 
loved. 
These 
notions 
are 
the 
more 
evil 
in 
relation 
to 
God 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
essence 
of 
piety 
is 
not 
only 
to 
fear 
him 
but 
also 
to 
love 
him 
above 
all 
things: 
and 
that 
cannot 
come 
about 
unless 
there 
be 
knowledge 
of 
his 
perfections 
capable 
of 
arousing 
the 
love 
which 
he 
deserves, 
and 
which 
makes 
the 
felicity 
of 
those 
that 
love 
him. 
Feeling 
ourselves 
animated 
by 
a 
zeal 
such 
as 
cannot 
fail 
to 
please 
him, 
we 
have 
cause 
to 
hope 
that 
he 
will 
enlighten 
us, 
and 
that 
he 
will 
himself 
aid 
us 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
a 
project 
undertaken 
for 
his 
glory 
and 
for 
the 
good 
of 
men. 
A 
cause 
so 
good 
gives 
confidence: 
if 
there 
are 
plausible 
appearances 
against 
us 
there 
are 
proofs 
on 
our 
side, 
and 
I 
would 
dareto 
say 
toanadversary: 
Aspice, 
quam 
mage 
sit 
nostrum 
penetrabile 
telum. 



7. 
God 
is 
the 
first 
reason 
of 
things: 
for 
such 
things 
as 
are 
bounded, 
as 
all 
that 
which 
we 
see 
and 
experience, 
are 
contingent 
and 
have 
nothing 
in 
them 
to 
render 
their 
existence 
necessary, 
it 
being 
plain 
that 
time, 
space 
and 
matter, 
united 
and 
uniform 
in 
themselves 
and 
indifferent 
to 
everything, 
might 
have 
received 
entirely 
other 
motions 
and 
shapes, 
and 
in 
another 
order. 
Therefore 
one 
must 
seek 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
world, 
which 
is 
the 
whole 
assemblage 
of 
contingent 
things, 
and 
seek 
it 
in 
the 
substance 
which 
carries 
with 
it 
the 
reason 
for 
its 
existence, 
and 
which 
in 
consequence 
is 
necessary 
and 
eternal. 
Moreover, 
this 
cause 
must 
be 
intelligent: 
for 
this 
existing 
world 
being 
contingent 
and 
an 
infinity 
of 
other 
worlds 
being 
equally 
possible, 
and 
holding, 
so 
to 
say, 
equal 
claim 
to 
existence 
with 
it, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
world 
must 
needs 
have 
had 
regard 
or 
reference 
to 
all 
these 
possible 
worlds 
in 
order 
to 
fix 
upon 
one 
of 
them. 
This 
regard 
or 
relation 
of 
an 
existent 
substance 
to 
simple 
possibilities 
can 
be 
nothing 
other 
than 
the 
understanding 
which 
has 
theideas 
ofthem, 
whileto 
fixupon 
oneof 
themcan 
benothing 
other 
than 
the 
act 
of 
the 
will 
which 
chooses. 
It 
is 
the 
power 
of 
this 
substance 
that 
renders 
its 
will 
efficacious. 
Power 
relates 
to 
being, 
wisdom 
or 
understanding 
to 
truth, 
and 
will 
to 
good. 
And 
this 
intelligent 
cause 
ought 
to 
be 
infinite 
in 
all 
ways, 
and 
absolutely 
perfect 
in 
power, 
in 
wisdom 
and 
in 
goodness, 
since 
it 
relates 
to 
all 
that 
which 
is 
possible. 
Furthermore, 
since 
all 
is 
connected 
together, 
there 
is 
no 
ground 
for 
admitting 
more 
than 
one. 
Its 
understanding 
is 
the 
sourceof 
essences, 
and 
its 
will 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
existences. 
There 
in 
few 
words 
is 
the 
proof 
of 
one 
only 
God 
with 
his 
perfections, 
and 
through 
him 
of 
the 
origin 
ofthings. 
8. 
Now 
this 
supreme 
wisdom, 
united 
to 
a 
goodness 
that 
is 
no 
less 
infinite, 
cannot 
but 
have 
chosenthebest. 
For 
as 
a 
lesser 
evil 
is 
a 
kindof 
good, 
even 
so 
a 
lesser 
good 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
evil 
if 
it 
stands 
in 
the 
way 
of 
a 
greater 
good; 
and 
there 
would 
be 
something 
to 
correct 
in 
the 
actions 
of 
God 
if 
it 
were 
possible 

to 
do 
better. 
As 
in 
mathematics, 
when 
there 
is 
no 
maximum 
nor 
minimum, 
in 
short 
nothing 
distinguished, 
everything 
is 
done 
equally, 
or 
when 
that 
is 
not 
possible 
nothing 
at 
all 
is 
done: 
so 
it 
may 
be 
said 
likewise 
in 
respect 
of 
perfect 
wisdom, 
which 
is 
no 
less 
orderly 
than 
mathematics, 
that 
if 
there 
were 
not 
the 
best 
(optimum) 
among 
all 
possible 
worlds, 
God 
would 
not 
have 
produced 
any. 
I 
call 
‘World’ 
the 
whole 
succession 
and 
the 
whole 
agglomeration 
of 
all 
existent 
things, 
lest 
it 
be 
said 
that 
several 
worlds 
could 
have 
existed 
in 
different 
times 
and 
different 
places. 
For 
they 
must 
needs 
be 
reckoned 
all 
together 
as 
one 
world 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
as 
one 
Universe. 
And 
even 
though 
one 
should 
fill 
all 
times 
and 
all 
places, 
it 
still 
remains 
true 
that 
one 
might 
have 
filled 
them 
in 
innumerable 
ways, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
an 
infinitude 
of 
possible 
worlds 
among 
which 
God 
must 
needs 
have 
chosen 
the 
best, 
since 
he 
does 
nothingwithoutacting 
inaccordancewithsupremereason. 


9. 
Some 
adversary 
not 
being 
able 
to 
answer 
this 
argument 
will 
perchance 
answer 
the 
conclusion 
by 
a 
counter-argument, 
saying 
that 
the 
world 
could 
have 
been 
without 
sin 
and 
without 
sufferings; 
but 
I 
deny 
that 
then 
it 
would 
have 
been 
better. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
known 
that 
all 
things 
are 
connected 
in 
each 
one 
of 
the 
possible 
worlds: 
the 
universe, 
whatever 
it 
may 
be, 
is 
all 
of 
one 
piece, 
like 
an 
ocean: 
the 
least 
movement 
extends 
its 
effect 
there 
to 
any 
distance 
whatsoever, 
even 
though 
this 
effect 
become 
less 
perceptible 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
distance. 
Therein 
God 
has 
ordered 
all 
things 
beforehand 
once 
for 
all, 
having 
foreseen 
prayers, 
good 
and 
bad 
actions, 
and 
all 
the 
rest; 
and 
each 
thing 
as 
an 
idea 
has 
contributed, 
before 
its 
existence, 
to 
the 
resolution 
that 
has 
been 
made 
upon 
the 
existence 
of 
all 
things; 
so 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
changed 
in 
the 
universe 
(any 
more 
than 
in 
a 
number) 
save 
its 
essence 
or, 
if 
you 
will, 
save 
its 
numerical 
individuality. 
Thus, 
if 
the 
smallest 
evil 
that 
comes 
to 
pass 
in 
the 
world 
were 
missing 
in 
it, 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
this 

world; 
which, 
with 
nothing 
omitted 
and 
all 
allowance 
made, 
was 
found 
the 
best 
bythe 
Creator 
whochoseit. 


10. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
one 
may 
imaginepossible 
worldswithout 
sinand 
without 
unhappiness, 
and 
one 
could 
make 
some 
like 
Utopian 
or 
Sevarambian 
romances: 
but 
these 
same 
worlds 
again 
would 
be 
very 
inferior 
to 
ours 
in 
goodness. 
I 
cannot 
show 
you 
this 
in 
detail. 
For 
can 
I 
know 
and 
can 
I 
present 
infinities 
to 
you 
and 
compare 
them 
together? 
But 
you 
must 
judge 
with 
me 
ab 
effectu, 
since 
God 
has 
chosen 
this 
world 
as 
it 
is. 
We 
know, 
moreover, 
that 
oftenanevilbringsforth 
agood 
wheretoonewould 
nothave 
attainedwithout 
that 
evil. 
Oftenindeedtwoevilshavemadeonegreatgood: 
Et 
si 
fata 
volunt, 
bina 
venena 
juvant. 


Even 
so 
two 
liquids 
sometimes 
produce 
a 
solid, 
witness 
the 
spirit 
of 
wine 
and 
spirit 
of 
urine 
mixed 
by 
Van 
Helmont; 
or 
so 
do 
two 
cold 
and 
dark 
bodies 
produce 
a 
great 
fire, 
witness 
an 
acid 
solution 
and 
an 
aromatic 
oil 
combined 
by 
Herr 
Hoffmann. 
A 
general 
makes 
sometimes 
a 
fortunate 
mistake 
which 
brings 
about 
the 
winning 
of 
a 
great 
battle; 
and 
do 
they 
not 
sing 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
Easter, 
inthechurchesof 
the 
Roman 
rite: 


O 
certe 
necessarium 
Adae 
peccatum, 
quod 
Christi 
morte 
deletum 
est! 
O 
felix 
culpa, 
quae 
talem 
ac 
tantum 
meruit 
habere 
Redemptorem! 


11. 
The 
illustrious 
prelates 
of 
the 
Gallican 
church 
who 
wrote 
to 
Pope 
Innocent 
XII 
against 
Cardinal 
Sfondrati’s 
book 
on 
predestination, 
being 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
have 
said 
things 
well 
fitted 
to 
elucidate 
this 
great 
point. 
The 
cardinal 
appears 
to 
prefer 
even 
to 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Heaven 
the 
state 
of 
children 
dying 
without 
baptism, 
because 
sin 
is 
the 
greatest 
of 
evils, 
and 
they 
have 
died 
innocent 
of 
all 
actual 
sin. 
More 
will 
be 
said 
of 
that 
below. 
The 
prelates 
have 
observed 
that 
this 
opinion 
is 
ill 
founded. 
The 
apostle, 
they 
say 
(Rom. 
iii. 
8), 
is 
right 
to 
disapprove 
of 
the 
doing 
of 
evil 
that 
good 
may 
come, 
but 
one 
cannot 
disapprove 
that 
God, 
through 
his 
exceeding 

power, 
derive 
from 
the 
permitting 
of 
sins 
greater 
goods 
than 
such 
as 
occurred 
before 
the 
sins. 
It 
is 
not 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
take 
pleasure 
in 
sin, 
God 
forbid! 
but 
that 
we 
believe 
the 
same 
apostle 
when 
he 
says 
(Rom. 
v. 
20) 
that 
where 
sin 
abounded, 
grace 
did 
much 
more 
abound; 
and 
we 
remember 
that 
we 
have 
gained 
Jesus 
Christ 
himself 
by 
reason 
of 
sin. 
Thus 
we 
see 
that 
the 
opinion 
of 
these 
prelates 
tends 
to 
maintain 
that 
a 
sequence 
of 
things 
where 
sin 
enters 
in 
may 
have 
been 
and 
has 
been, 
in 
effect, 
better 
than 
another 
sequence 
without 
sin. 


12. 
Use 
has 
ever 
been 
made 
of 
comparisons 
taken 
from 
the 
pleasures 
of 
the 
senses 
when 
these 
are 
mingled 
with 
that 
which 
borders 
on 
pain, 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
is 
something 
of 
like 
nature 
in 
intellectual 
pleasures. 
A 
little 
acid, 
sharpness 
or 
bitterness 
is 
often 
more 
pleasing 
than 
sugar; 
shadows 
enhance 
colours; 
and 
even 
a 
dissonance 
in 
the 
right 
place 
gives 
relief 
to 
harmony. 
We 
wish 
to 
be 
terrified 
by 
rope-dancers 
on 
the 
point 
of 
falling 
and 
we 
wish 
that 
tragedies 
shall 
well-nigh 
cause 
us 
to 
weep. 
Do 
men 
relish 
health 
enough, 
or 
thank 
God 
enough 
for 
it, 
without 
having 
ever 
been 
sick? 
And 
is 
it 
not 
most 
often 
necessary 
that 
a 
little 
evil 
render 
the 
good 
more 
discernible, 
that 
is 
to 
say,greater? 
13. 
But 
it 
will 
be 
said 
that 
evils 
are 
great 
and 
many 
in 
number 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
good: 
that 
is 
erroneous. 
It 
is 
only 
want 
of 
attention 
that 
diminishes 
our 
good, 
and 
this 
attention 
must 
be 
given 
to 
us 
through 
some 
admixture 
of 
evils. 
If 
we 
were 
usually 
sick 
and 
seldom 
in 
good 
health, 
we 
should 
be 
wonderfully 
sensible 
of 
that 
great 
good 
and 
we 
should 
be 
less 
sensible 
of 
our 
evils. 
But 
is 
it 
not 
better, 
notwithstanding, 
that 
health 
should 
be 
usual 
andsickness 
the 
exception? 
Let 
us 
then 
by 
our 
reflexion 
supply 
what 
is 
lacking 
in 
our 
perception, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
the 
good 
of 
health 
more 
discernible. 
Had 
we 
not 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
life 
to 
come, 
I 
believe 
there 
would 
be 
few 
persons 
who, 
being 
at 
the 
point 
of 
death, 
were 
not 
content 
to 

take 
up 
life 
again, 
on 
condition 
of 
passing 
through 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
provided 
always 
that 
it 
were 
not 
the 
same 
kind: 
one 
would 
be 
content 
with 
variety, 
without 
requiring 
a 
better 
condition 
than 
that 
wherein 
one 
hadbeen. 


14. 
When 
one 
considers 
also 
the 
fragility 
of 
the 
human 
body, 
one 
looks 
in 
wonder 
at 
the 
wisdom 
and 
the 
goodness 
of 
the 
Author 
of 
Nature, 
who 
has 
made 
the 
body 
so 
enduring 
and 
its 
condition 
so 
tolerable. 
That 
has 
often 
made 
me 
say 
that 
I 
am 
not 
astonished 
men 
are 
sometimes 
sick, 
but 
that 
I 
am 
astonished 
they 
are 
sick 
so 
little 
and 
not 
always. 
This 
also 
ought 
to 
make 
us 
the 
more 
esteem 
the 
divine 
contrivance 
of 
the 
mechanism 
of 
animals, 
whose 
Author 
has 
made 
machines 
so 
fragile 
and 
so 
subject 
to 
corruption 
and 
yet 
so 
capable 
of 
maintaining 
themselves: 
for 
it 
is 
Nature 
which 
cures 
us 
rather 
than 
medicine. 
Now 
this 
very 
fragility 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
unless 
we 
are 
to 
will 
that 
this 
kind 
of 
creature, 
reasoning 
and 
clothed 
in 
flesh 
and 
bones, 
be 
not 
in 
the 
world. 
But 
that, 
to 
all 
appearance, 
would 
be 
a 
defect 
which 
some 
philosophers 
of 
old 
would 
have 
called 
vacuum 
formarum, 
a 
gap 
intheorderof 
species. 
15. 
Those 
whose 
humour 
it 
is 
to 
be 
well 
satisfied 
with 
Nature 
and 
with 
fortune 
and 
not 
to 
complain 
about 
them, 
even 
though 
they 
should 
not 
be 
the 
best 
endowed, 
appear 
to 
me 
preferable 
to 
the 
other 
sort; 
for 
besides 
that 
these 
complaints 
are 
ill 
founded, 
it 
is 
in 
effect 
murmuring 
against 
the 
orders 
of 
providence. 
One 
must 
not 
readily 
be 
among 
the 
malcontents 
in 
the 
State 
where 
one 
is, 
and 
one 
must 
not 
be 
so 
at 
all 
in 
the 
city 
of 
God, 
wherein 
one 
can 
only 
wrongfully 
be 
of 
their 
number. 
The 
books 
of 
human 
misery, 
such 
as 
that 
of 
Pope 
Innocent 
III, 
to 
me 
seem 
not 
of 
the 
most 
serviceable: 
evils 
are 
doubled 
by 
being 
given 
an 
attention 
that 
ought 
to 
be 
averted 
from 
them, 
to 
be 
turned 
towards 
the 
good 
which 
by 
far 
preponderates. 
Even 
less 
do 
I 
approve 
books 
such 
as 
that 
of 
Abbé 
Esprit, 
On 
the 
Falsity 
of 
Human 
Virtues, 
of 
which 

we 
have 
lately 
been 
given 
a 
summary: 
for 
such 
a 
book 
serves 
to 
turn 
everything 
wrongsideout,and 
causementobesuchasitrepresents 
them. 


16. 
It 
must 
be 
confessed, 
however, 
that 
there 
are 
disorders 
in 
this 
life, 
which 
appear 
especially 
in 
the 
prosperity 
of 
sundry 
evil 
men 
and 
in 
the 
misfortune 
of 
many 
good 
people. 
There 
is 
a 
German 
proverb 
which 
even 
grants 
the 
advantage 
to 
the 
evil 
ones, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
commonly 
the 
most 
fortunate: 
Je 
krümmer 
Holz, 
je 
bessre 
Krücke: 
Je 
ärger 
Schalck, 
je 
grösser 
Glücke. 


And 
it 
were 
to 
be 
desired 
that 
this 
saying 
of 
Horace 
should 
be 
true 
in 
our 
eyes: 


Raro 
antecedentem 
scelestum 
Deseruit 
pede 
poena 
claudo. 


Yet 
itoftencomes 
topass 
also,thoughthisperchancenotthemostoften, 


That 
in 
the 
world’s 
eyes 
Heaven 
is 
justified, 


and 
thatonemaysaywith 
Claudian: 


Abstulit 
hunc 
tandem 
Rufini 
poena 
tumultum, 
Absolvitque 
deos... 


17. 
But 
even 
though 
that 
should 
not 
happen 
here, 
the 
remedy 
is 
all 
prepared 
in 
the 
otherlife:religionand 
reasonitself 
teach 
us 
that,andwe 
must 
not 
murmur 
against 
a 
respite 
which 
the 
supreme 
wisdom 
has 
thought 
fit 
to 
grant 
to 
men 
for 
repentance. 
Yet 
there 
objections 
multiply 
on 
another 
side, 
when 
one 
considers 
salvation 
and 
damnation: 
for 
it 
appears 
strange 
that, 
even 
in 
the 
great 
future 
of 
eternity, 
evil 
should 
have 
the 
advantage 
over 
good, 
under 
the 
supreme 
authority 
of 
him 
who 
is 
the 
sovereign 
good, 
since 
there 
will 
be 
many 
that 
are 
called 
and 
few 
that 
are 
chosen 
or 
are 
saved. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
onesees 
fromsomelinesofPrudentius(Hymn. 
anteSomnum),

that 
divers 
men 
believed 
in 
his 
time 
that 
the 
number 
of 
those 
wicked 
enough 
to 
be 
damned 
would 
be 
very 
small. 
To 
some 
indeed 
it 
seems 
that 
men 
believed 
at 
that 
time 
in 
a 
sphere 
between 
Hell 
and 
Paradise; 
that 
this 
same 
Prudentius 
speaks 
as 
if 
he 
were 
satisfied 
with 
this 
sphere; 
that 
St. 
Gregory 
of 
Nyssa 
also 
inclines 
in 
that 
direction, 
and 
that 
St. 
Jerome 
leans 
towards 
the 
opinion 
according 
whereunto 
all 
Christians 
would 
finally 
be 
taken 
into 
grace. 
A 
saying 
of 
St. 
Paul 
which 
he 
himself 
gives 
out 
as 
mysterious, 
stating 
that 
all 
Israel 
will 
be 
saved, 
has 
provided 
much 
food 
for 
reflexion. 
Sundry 
pious 
persons, 
learned 
also, 
but 
daring, 
have 
revived 
the 
opinion 
of 
Origen, 
who 
maintains 
that 
good 
will 
predominate 
in 
due 
time, 
in 
all 
and 
everywhere, 
and 
that 
all 
rational 
creatures, 
even 
the 
bad 
angels, 
will 
become 
at 
last 
holy 
and 
blessed. 
The 
book 
of 
the 
eternal 
Gospel, 
published 
lately 
in 
German 
and 
supported 
by 
a 
great 
and 
learned 
work 
entitled 
‘Αποκαταστασις 
παντων, 
has 
caused 
much 
stir 
over 
this 
great 
paradox. 
M. 
le 
Clerc 
also 
has 
ingeniously 
pleadedthe 
causeoftheOrigenists,butwithoutdeclaringhimselffor 
them. 


18. 
There 
is 
a 
man 
of 
wit 
who, 
pushing 
my 
principle 
of 
harmony 
even 
to 
arbitrary 
suppositions 
that 
I 
in 
no 
wise 
approve, 
has 
created 
for 
himself 
a 
theology 
well-nigh 
astronomical. 
He 
believes 
that 
the 
present 
confusion 
in 
this 
world 
below 
began 
when 
the 
Presiding 
Angel 
of 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth, 
which 
was 
still 
a 
sun 
(that 
is, 
a 
star 
that 
was 
fixed 
and 
luminous 
of 
itself) 
committed 
a 
sin 
with 
some 
lesser 
angels 
of 
his 
department, 
perhaps 
rising 
inopportunely 
against 
an 
angel 
of 
a 
greater 
sun; 
that 
simultaneously, 
by 
the 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
of 
the 
Realms 
of 
Nature 
and 
of 
Grace, 
and 

consequently 
by 
natural 
causes 
occurring 
at 
the 
appointed 
time, 
our 
globe 
was 
covered 
with 
stains, 
rendered 
opaque 
and 
driven 
from 
its 
place; 
which 
has 
made 
it 
become 
a 
wandering 
star 
or 
planet, 
that 
is, 
a 
Satellite 
of 
another 
sun, 
and 
even 
perhaps 
of 
that 
one 
whose 
superiority 
its 
angel 
refused 
to 
recognize; 
and 
that 
therein 
consists 
the 
fall 
of 
Lucifer. 
Now 
the 
chief 
of 
the 
bad 
angels, 
who 
in 
Holy 
Scripture 
is 
named 
the 
prince, 
and 
even 
the 
god 
of 
this 
world, 
being, 
with 
the 
angels 
of 
his 
train, 
envious 
of 
that 
rational 
animal 
which 
walks 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
this 
globe, 
and 
which 
God 
has 
set 
up 
there 
perhaps 
to 
compensate 
himself 
for 
their 
fall, 
strives 
to 
render 
it 
accessary 
in 
their 
crimes 
and 
a 
participator 
in 
their 
misfortunes. 
Whereupon 
Jesus 
Christ 
came 
to 
save 
men. 
He 
is 
the 
eternal 
Son 
of 
God, 
even 
as 
he 
is 
his 
only 
Son; 
but 
(according 
to 
some 
ancient 
Christians, 
and 
according 
to 
the 
author 
of 
this 
hypothesis) 
having 
taken 
upon 
him 
at 
first, 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
things, 
the 
most 
excellent 
nature 
among 
created 
beings, 
to 
bring 
them 
all 
to 
perfection, 
he 
set 
himself 
amongst 
them: 
and 
this 
is 
the 
second 
filiation, 
whereby 
he 
is 
the 
first-born 
of 
all 
creatures. 
This 
is 
he 
whom 
the 
Cabalists 
called 
Adam 
Kadmon. 
Haply 
he 
had 
planted 
his 
tabernacle 
in 
that 
great 
sun 
which 
illumines 
us; 
but 
he 
came 
at 
last 
into 
this 
globe 
where 
we 
are, 
he 
was 
born 
of 
the 
Virgin, 
and 
took 
human 
nature 
upon 
him 
to 
save 
mankind 
from 
the 
hands 
of 
their 
enemy 
and 
his. 
And 
when 
the 
time 
of 
judgement 
shall 
draw 
near, 
when 
the 
present 
face 
of 
our 
globe 
shall 
be 
about 
to 
perish, 
he 
will 
return 
to 
it 
in 
visible 
form, 
thence 
to 
withdraw 
the 
good, 
transplanting 
them, 
it 
may 
be, 
into 
the 
sun, 
and 
to 
punish 
here 
the 
wicked 
with 
the 
demons 
that 
have 
allured 
them; 
then 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth 
will 
begin 
to 
burn 
and 
will 
be 
perhaps 
a 
comet. 
This 
fire 
will 
last 
for 
aeons 
upon 
aeons. 
The 
tail 
of 
the 
comet 
is 
intended 
by 
the 
smoke 
which 
will 
rise 
incessantly, 
according 
to 
the 
Apocalypse, 
and 
this 
fire 
will 
be 
hell, 
or 
the 
second 
death 
whereof 
Holy 
Scripture 
speaks. 
But 
at 
last 
hell 
will 
render 
up 
its 
dead, 
death 
itself 
will 
be 



destroyed; 
reason 
and 
peace 
will 
begin 
to 
hold 
sway 
again 
in 
the 
spirits 
that 
had 
been 
perverted; 
they 
will 
be 
sensible 
of 
their 
error, 
they 
will 
adore 
their 
Creator, 
and 
will 
even 
begin 
to 
love 
him 
all 
the 
more 
for 
seeing 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
abyss 
whence 
they 
emerge. 
Simultaneously 
(by 
virtue 
of 
the 
harmonic 
parallelism 
of 
the 
Realms 
of 
Nature 
and 
of 
Grace) 
this 
long 
and 
great 
conflagration 
will 
have 
purged 
the 
earth’s 
globe 
of 
its 
stains. 
It 
will 
become 
again 
a 
sun; 
its 
Presiding 
Angel 
will 
resume 
his 
place 
with 
the 
angels 
of 
his 
train; 
humans 
that 
were 
damned 
shall 
be 
with 
them 
numbered 
amongst 
the 
good 
angels; 
this 
chief 
of 
our 
globe 
shall 
render 
homage 
to 
the 
Messiah, 
chief 
of 
created 
beings. 
The 
glory 
of 
this 
angel 
reconciled 
shall 
be 
greater 
than 
it 
was 
beforehisfall. 


Inque 
Deos 
iterum

Aureus

regnabit 
Apollo. 


The 
vision 
seemed 
tome 
pleasing, 
andworthy 
of 
a 
follower 
of 
Origen:but 
we 
have 
no 
need 
of 
such 
hypothesis 
or 
fictions, 
where 
Wit 
plays 
a 
greater 
part 
than 
Revelation, 
and 
which 
even 
Reason 
cannot 
turn 
to 
account. 
For 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
that 
there 
is 
one 
principal 
place 
in 
the 
known 
universe 
deserving 
in 
preference 
to 
the 
rest 
to 
be 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
eldest 
of 
created 
beings;andthesun 
ofoursystemat

19. 
Holding 
then 
to 
the 
established 
doctrine 
that 
the 
number 
of 
men 
damned 
eternally 
will 
be 
incomparably 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
the 
saved, 
we 
must 
say 
that 
the 
evil 
could 
not 
but 
seem 
to 
be 
almost 
as 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
good, 
when 
one 
contemplates 
the 
true 
vastness 
of 
the 
city 
of 
God. 
Coelius 
Secundus 
Curio 
wrote 
a 
little 
book, 
De 
Amplitudine 
Regni 
Coelestis, 
which 
was 
reprinted 
not 
long 
since; 
but 
he 
is 
indeed 
far 
from 
having 
apprehended 
the 
compass 
of 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heaven. 
The 
ancients 
had 
puny 
ideas 
on 
the 
works 
of 
God, 
and 
St. 
Augustine, 
for 
want 
of 
knowing 
modern 
discoveries, 
was 
at 
a 
loss 
when 
there 
was 
question 
of 
explaining 
the 

prevalence 
of 
evil. 
It 
seemed 
to 
the 
ancients 
that 
there 
was 
only 
one 
earth 
inhabited, 
and 
even 
of 
that 
men 
held 
the 
antipodes 
in 
dread: 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
world 
was, 
according 
to 
them, 
a 
few 
shining 
globes 
and 
a 
few 
crystalline 
spheres. 
To-day, 
whatever 
bounds 
are 
given 
or 
not 
given 
to 
the 
universe, 
it 
must 
be 
acknowledged 
that 
there 
is 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
globes, 
as 
great 
as 
and 
greater 
than 
ours, 
which 
have 
as 
much 
right 
as 
it 
to 
hold 
rational 
inhabitants, 
though 
it 
follows 
not 
at 
all 
that 
they 
are 
human. 
It 
is 
only 
one 
planet, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
one 
of 
the 
six 
principal 
satellites 
of 
our 
sun; 
and 
as 
all 
fixed 
stars 
are 
suns 
also, 
we 
see 
how 
small 
a 
thing 
our 
earth 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
visible 
things, 
since 
it 
is 
only 
an 
appendix 
of 
one 
amongst 
them. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
all 
suns 
are 
peopled 
only 
by 
blessed 
creatures, 
and 
nothing 
constrains 
us 
to 
think 
that 
many 
are 
damned, 
for 
few 
instances 
or 
few 
samples 
suffice 
to 
show 
the 
advantage 
which 
good 
extracts 
from 
evil. 
Moreover, 
since 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
for 
the 
belief 
that 
there 
are 
stars 
everywhere, 
is 
it 
not 
possible 
that 
there 
may 
be 
a 
great 
space 
beyond 
the 
region 
of 
the 
stars? 
Whether 
it 
be 
the 
Empyrean 
Heaven, 
or 
not, 
this 
immense 
space 
encircling 
all 
this 
region 
may 
in 
any 
case 
be 
filled 
with 
happiness 
and 
glory. 
It 
can 
be 
imagined 
as 
like 
the 
Ocean, 
whither 
flow 
the 
rivers 
of 
all 
blessed 
creatures, 
when 
they 
shall 
have 
reached 
their 
perfection 
in 
the 
system 
of 
the 
stars. 
What 
will 
become 
of 
the 
consideration 
of 
our 
globe 
and 
its 
inhabitants? 
Will 
it 
not 
be 
something 
incomparably 
less 
than 
a 
physical 
point, 
since 
our 
earth 
is 
as 
a 
point 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
distance 
of 
some 
fixed 
stars? 
Thus 
since 
the 
proportion 
of 
that 
part 
of 
the 
universe 
which 
we 
know 
is 
almost 
lost 
in 
nothingness 
compared 
with 
that 
which 
is 
unknown, 
and 
which 
we 
yet 
have 
cause 
to 
assume, 
and 
since 
all 
the 
evils 
that 
may 
be 
raised 
in 
objection 
before 
us 
are 
in 
this 
near 
nothingness, 
haply 
it 
may 
be 
that 
all 
evils 
are 
almost 
nothingness 
in 
comparisonwith 
thegood 
thingswhichareintheuniverse. 



20. 
But 
it 
is 
necessary 
also 
to 
meet 
the 
more 
speculative 
and 
metaphysical 
difficulties 
which 
have 
been 
mentioned, 
and 
which 
concern 
the 
cause 
of 
evil. 
The 
question 
is 
asked 
first 
of 
all, 
whence 
does 
evil 
come? 
Si 
Deus 
est, 
unde 
malum? 
Si 
non 
est, 
unde 
bonum? 
The 
ancients 
attributed 
the 
cause 
of 
evil 
to 
matter, 
which 
they 
believed 
uncreate 
and 
independent 
of 
God: 
but 
we, 
who 
derive 
all 
being 
from 
God, 
where 
shall 
we 
find 
the 
source 
of 
evil? 
The 
answeris,that 
itmustbe 
soughtin 
theidealnatureofthecreature,inso 
far 
as 
this 
nature 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
eternal 
verities 
which 
are 
in 
the 
understanding 
of 
God, 
independently 
of 
his 
will. 
For 
we 
must 
consider 
that 
there 
is 
an 
original 
imperfection 
in 
the 
creature 
before 
sin, 
because 
the 
creature 
is 
limited 
in 
its 
essence; 
whence 
ensues 
that 
it 
cannot 
know 
all, 
and 
that 
it 
can 
deceive 
itself 
and 
commit 
other 
errors. 
Plato 
said 
in 
Timaeus 
that 
the 
world 
originated 
in 
Understanding 
united 
to 
Necessity. 
Others 
have 
united 
God 
and 
Nature. 
This 
can 
be 
given 
a 
reasonable 
meaning. 
God 
will 
be 
the 
Understanding; 
and 
the 
Necessity, 
that 
is, 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
things, 
will 
be 
the 
object 
of 
the 
understanding, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
this 
object 
consists 
in 
the 
eternal 
verities. 
But 
this 
object 
is 
inward 
and 
abides 
in 
the 
divine 
understanding. 
And 
therein 
is 
found 
not 
only 
the 
primitive 
form 
of 
good, 
but 
also 
the 
origin 
of 
evil: 
the 
Region 
of 
the 
Eternal 
Verities 
must 
be 
substituted 
formatterwhenweareconcerned 
withseekingoutthesourceof 
things. 
This 
region 
is 
the 
ideal 
cause 
of 
evil 
(as 
it 
were) 
as 
well 
as 
of 
good: 
but, 
properly 
speaking, 
the 
formal 
character 
of 
evil 
has 
no 
efficient 
cause, 
for 
it 
consistsinprivation,as 
we 
shallsee, 
namely, 
inthat 
which 
the 
efficient 
cause 
does 
not 
bring 
about. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
Schoolmen 
are 
wont 
to 
call 
the 
cause 
of 
evil 
deficient. 


21. 
Evil 
may 
be 
taken 
metaphysically, 
physically 
and 
morally. 
Metaphysical 
evil 
consists 
in 
mere 
imperfection, 
physical 
evil 
in 
suffering, 
and 
moral 
evil 
in 
sin. 
Now 
although 
physical 
evil 
and 
moral 
evil 
be 
not 

necessary, 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
eternal 
verities 
they 
be 
possible. 
And 
as 
this 
vast 
Region 
of 
Verities 
contains 
all 
possibilities 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
there 
be 
an 
infinitude 
of 
possible 
worlds, 
that 
evil 
enter 
into 
divers 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
even 
the 
best 
of 
all 
contain 
a 
measure 
thereof. 
Thus 
has 
God 
beeninducedtopermitevil. 


22. 
But 
someone 
will 
say 
to 
me: 
why 
speak 
you 
to 
us 
of 
‘permitting’? 
Is 
it 
not 
God 
that 
doeth 
the 
evil 
and 
that 
willeth 
it? 
Here 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
explain 
what 
‘permission’ 
is, 
so 
that 
it 
may 
be 
seen 
how 
this 
term 
is 
not 
employed 
without 
reason. 
But 
before 
that 
one 
must 
explain 
the 
nature 
of 
will, 
which 
has 
its 
own 
degrees. 
Taking 
it 
in 
the 
general 
sense, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
will 
consists 
in 
the 
inclination 
to 
do 
something 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
good 
it 
contains. 
This 
will 
is 
called 
antecedent 
when 
it 
is 
detached, 
and 
considers 
each 
good 
separately 
in 
the 
capacity 
of 
a 
good. 
In 
this 
sense 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
God 
tends 
to 
all 
good, 
as 
good, 
ad 
perfectionem 
simpliciter 
simplicem,to 
speak 
like 
the 
Schoolmen, 
and 
that 
by 
an 
antecedent 
will. 
He 
is 
earnestly 
disposed 
to 
sanctify 
and 
to 
save 
all 
men, 
to 
exclude 
sin, 
and 
to 
prevent 
damnation. 
It 
may 
even 
be 
said 
that 
this 
will 
is 
efficacious 
of 
itself 
(per 
se), 
that 
is, 
in 
such 
sort 
that 
the 
effect 
would 
ensue 
if 
there 
were 
not 
some 
stronger 
reason 
to 
prevent 
it: 
for 
this 
will 
does 
not 
pass 
into 
final 
exercise 
(ad 
summum 
conatum), 
else 
it 
would 
never 
fail 
to 
produce 
its 
full 
effect, 
God 
being 
the 
master 
of 
all 
things. 
Success 
entire 
and 
infallible 
belongs 
only 
to 
the 
consequent 
will, 
as 
it 
is 
called. 
This 
it 
is 
which 
is 
complete; 
and 
in 
regard 
to 
it 
this 
rule 
obtains, 
that 
one 
never 
fails 
to 
do 
what 
one 
wills, 
when 
one 
has 
the 
power. 
Now 
this 
consequent 
will, 
final 
and 
decisive, 
results 
from 
the 
conflict 
of 
all 
the 
antecedent 
wills, 
of 
those 
which 
tend 
towards 
good, 
even 
as 
of 
those 
which 
repel 
evil; 
and 
from 
the 
concurrence 
of 
all 
these 
particular 
wills 
comes 
the 
total 
will. 
So 
in 
mechanics 
compound 
movement 
results 
from 
all 
the 
tendencies 
that 
concur 
in 
one 
and 
the 
same 
moving 
body, 
and 
satisfies 

each 
one 
equally, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
do 
all 
at 
one 
time. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
the 
moving 
body 
took 
equal 
account 
of 
these 
tendencies, 
as 
I 
once 
showed 
in 
one 
of 
the 
Paris 
Journals 
(7 
Sept. 
1693), 
when 
giving 
the 
general 
law 
of 
the 
compositions 
of 
movement. 
In 
this 
sense 
also 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
antecedentwillisefficaciousinasenseand 
eveneffectivewithsuccess. 


23. 
Thence 
it 
follows 
that 
God 
wills 
antecedently 
the 
good 
and 
consequently 
the 
best. 
And 
as 
for 
evil, 
God 
wills 
moral 
evil 
not 
at 
all, 
and 
physical 
evil 
or 
suffering 
he 
does 
not 
will 
absolutely. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
absolute 
predestination 
to 
damnation; 
and 
one 
may 
say 
of 
physical 
evil, 
that 
God 
wills 
it 
often 
as 
a 
penalty 
owing 
to 
guilt, 
and 
often 
also 
as 
a 
means 
to 
an 
end, 
that 
is, 
to 
prevent 
greater 
evils 
or 
to 
obtain 
greater 
good. 
The 
penalty 
serves 
also 
for 
amendment 
and 
example. 
Evil 
often 
serves 
to 
make 
us 
savour 
good 
the 
more; 
sometimes 
too 
it 
contributes 
to 
a 
greater 
perfection 
in 
him 
who 
suffers 
it, 
as 
the 
seed 
that 
one 
sows 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
kind 
of 
corruption 
before 
it 
can 
germinate: 
this 
is 
a 
beautiful 
similitude, 
which 
Jesus 
Christ 
himselfused. 
24. 
Concerning 
sin 
or 
moral 
evil, 
although 
it 
happens 
very 
often 
that 
it 
may 
serve 
as 
a 
means 
of 
obtaining 
good 
or 
of 
preventing 
another 
evil, 
it 
is 
not 
this 
that 
renders 
it 
a 
sufficient 
object 
of 
the 
divine 
will 
or 
a 
legitimate 
object 
of 
a 
created 
will. 
It 
must 
only 
be 
admitted 
or 
permitted 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
certain 
consequence 
of 
an 
indispensable 
duty: 
as 
for 
instance 
if 
a 
man 
who 
was 
determined 
not 
to 
permit 
another’s 
sin 
were 
to 
fail 
of 
his 
own 
duty, 
or 
as 
if 
an 
officer 
on 
guard 
at 
an 
important 
post 
were 
to 
leave 
it, 
especially 
in 
time 
of 
danger, 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
a 
quarrel 
in 
the 
town 
between 
twosoldiersofthegarrisonwho 
wanted 
tokilleachother. 
25. 
The 
rule 
which 
states, 
non 
esse 
facienda 
mala, 
ut 
eveniant 
bona, 
and 
whichevenforbidsthepermissionofamoralevilwiththeend 
ofobtaininga 
physical 
good, 
far 
from 
being 
violated, 
is 
here 
proved, 
and 
its 
source 
and 
its 

reason 
are 
demonstrated. 
One 
will 
not 
approve 
the 
action 
of 
a 
queen 
who, 
under 
the 
pretext 
of 
saving 
the 
State, 
commits 
or 
even 
permits 
a 
crime. 
The 
crime 
is 
certain 
and 
the 
evil 
for 
the 
State 
is 
open 
to 
question. 
Moreover, 
this 
manner 
of 
giving 
sanction 
to 
crimes, 
if 
it 
were 
accepted, 
would 
be 
worse 
than 
a 
disruption 
of 
some 
one 
country, 
which 
is 
liable 
enough 
to 
happen 
in 
any 
case, 
and 
would 
perchance 
happen 
all 
the 
more 
by 
reason 
of 
such 
means 
chosen 
to 
prevent 
it. 
But 
in 
relation 
to 
God 
nothing 
is 
open 
to 
question, 
nothing 
can 
be 
opposed 
to 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
best, 
which 
suffers 
neither 
exception 
nor 
dispensation. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
sense 
that 
God 
permits 
sin: 
for 
he 
would 
fail 
in 
what 
he 
owes 
to 
himself, 
in 
what 
he 
owes 
to 
his 
wisdom, 
his 
goodness, 
his 
perfection, 
if 
he 
followed 
not 
the 
grand 
result 
of 
all 
his 
tendencies 
to 
good, 
and 
if 
he 
chose 
not 
that 
which 
is 
absolutely 
the 
best, 
notwithstanding 
the 
evil 
of 
guilt, 
which 
is 
involved 
therein 
by 
the 
supreme 
necessity 
of 
the 
eternal 
verities. 
Hence 
the 
conclusion 
that 
God 
wills 
all 
good 
in 
himself 
antecedently, 
that 
he 
wills 
the 
best 
consequently 
as 
an 
end, 
that 
he 
wills 
what 
is 
indifferent, 
and 
physical 
evil, 
sometimes 
as 
a 
means, 
but 
that 
he 
will 
only 
permit 
moral 
evil 
as 
the 
sine 
quo 
non 
or 
as 
a 
hypothetical 
necessity 
which 
connects 
it 
with 
the 
best. 
Therefore 
the 
consequent 
will 
of 
God, 
which 
hassinforitsobject,isonly 
permissive. 


26. 
It 
is 
again 
well 
to 
consider 
that 
moral 
evil 
is 
an 
evil 
so 
great 
only 
because 
it 
is 
a 
source 
of 
physical 
evils, 
a 
source 
existing 
in 
one 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
of 
creatures, 
who 
is 
also 
most 
capable 
of 
causing 
those 
evils. 
For 
an 
evil 
will 
is 
in 
its 
department 
what 
the 
evil 
principle 
of 
the 
Manichaeans 
would 
be 
in 
the 
universe; 
and 
reason, 
which 
is 
an 
image 
of 
the 
Divinity, 
provides 
for 
evil 
souls 
great 
means 
of 
causing 
much 
evil. 
One 
single 
Caligula, 
one 
Nero, 
has 
caused 
more 
evil 
than 
an 
earthquake. 
An 
evil 
man 
takes 
pleasure 
in 
causing 
suffering 
and 
destruction, 
and 
for 
that 
there 
are 
only 
too 
many 
opportunities. 
But 
God 
being 
inclined 
to 
produce 
as 
much 
good 
as 

possible, 
and 
having 
all 
the 
knowledge 
and 
all 
the 
power 
necessary 
for 
that, 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
in 
him 
there 
be 
fault, 
or 
guilt, 
or 
sin; 
and 
when 
he 
permits 
sin,itiswisdom, 
itisvirtue. 


27. 
It 
is 
indeed 
beyond 
question 
that 
we 
must 
refrain 
from 
preventing 
the 
sin 
of 
others 
when 
we 
cannot 
prevent 
their 
sin 
without 
sinning 
ourselves. 
But 
someone 
will 
perhaps 
bring 
up 
the 
objection 
that 
it 
is 
God 
himself 
who 
acts 
and 
who 
effects 
all 
that 
is 
real 
in 
the 
sin 
of 
the 
creature. 
This 
objection 
leads 
us 
to 
consider 
the 
physical 
co-operation 
of 
God 
with 
the 
creature, 
after 
we 
have 
examined 
the 
moral 
co-operation, 
which 
was 
the 
more 
perplexing. 
Some 
have 
believed, 
with 
the 
celebrated 
Durand 
de 
Saint-Pourçain 
and 
Cardinal 
Aureolus, 
the 
famous 
Schoolman, 
that 
the 
co-operation 
of 
God 
with 
the 
creature 
(I 
mean 
the 
physical 
cooperation) 
is 
only 
general 
and 
mediate, 
and 
that 
God 
creates 
substances 
and 
gives 
them 
the 
force 
they 
need; 
and 
that 
thereafter 
he 
leaves 
them 
to 
themselves, 
and 
does 
naught 
but 
conserve 
them, 
without 
aiding 
them 
in 
their 
actions. 
This 
opinion 
has 
been 
refuted 
by 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
Scholastic 
theologians, 
and 
it 
appears 
that 
in 
the 
past 
it 
met 
with 
disapproval 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Pelagius. 
Nevertheless 
a 
Capuchin 
named 
LouisPereirof 
Dole,abouttheyear1630, 
wroteabookexpressly 
toreviveit, 
at 
least 
in 
relation 
to 
free 
actions. 
Some 
moderns 
incline 
thereto, 
and 
M. 
Bernier 
supports 
it 
in 
a 
little 
book 
on 
freedom 
and 
freewill. 
But 
one 
cannot 
say 
in 
relation 
to 
God 
what 
‘to 
conserve’ 
is, 
without 
reverting 
to 
the 
general 
opinion. 
Also 
it 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
that 
the 
action 
of 
God 
in 
conserving 
should 
have 
some 
reference 
to 
that 
which 
is 
conserved, 
according 
to 
what 
it 
is 
and 
to 
the 
state 
wherein 
it 
is; 
thus 
his 
action 
cannot 
be 
general 
or 
indeterminate. 
These 
generalities 
are 
abstractions 
not 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
truth 
of 
individual 
things, 
and 
the 
conservation 
of 
a 
man 
standing 
is 
different 
from 
the 
conservation 
of 
a 
man 
seated. 
This 
would 
not 
be 
so 
if 
conservation 
consisted 
only 
in 
the 
act 
of 
preventing 
and 
warding 
off 
some 
foreign 
cause 

which 
could 
destroy 
that 
which 
one 
wishes 
to 
conserve; 
as 
often 
happens 
when 
men 
conserve 
something. 
But 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
obliged 
ourselves 
sometimes 
to 
maintain 
that 
which 
we 
conserve, 
we 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
conservation 
by 
God 
consists 
in 
the 
perpetual 
immediate 
influence 
which 
the 
dependence 
of 
creatures 
demands. 
This 
dependence 
attaches 
not 
only 
to 
the 
substancebut 
also 
tothe 
action, 
andonecanperhaps 
not 
explain 
it 
better 
thanbysaying,withtheologians 
andphilosophersin 
general,thatitis 
a 
continuedcreation. 


28. 
The 
objection 
will 
be 
made 
that 
God 
therefore 
now 
creates 
man 
a 
sinner, 
he 
that 
in 
the 
beginning 
created 
him 
innocent. 
But 
here 
it 
must 
be 
said, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
moral 
aspect, 
that 
God 
being 
supremely 
wise 
cannot 
failtoobservecertainlaws,andto 
actaccordingtotherules,aswellphysical 
as 
moral, 
that 
wisdom 
has 
made 
him 
choose. 
And 
the 
same 
reason 
that 
has 
made 
him 
create 
man 
innocent, 
but 
liable 
to 
fall, 
makes 
him 
re-create 
man 
when 
he 
falls; 
for 
God’s 
knowledge 
causes 
the 
future 
to 
be 
for 
him 
as 
the 
present,andprevents 
himfromrescindingtheresolutions 
made. 
29. 
As 
for 
physical 
co-operation, 
here 
one 
must 
consider 
the 
truth 
which 
has 
made 
already 
so 
much 
stir 
in 
the 
Schools 
since 
St. 
Augustine 
declared 
it, 
that 
evil 
is 
a 
privation 
of 
being, 
whereas 
the 
action 
of 
God 
tends 
to 
the 
positive. 
This 
answer 
is 
accounted 
a 
quibble, 
and 
even 
something 
chimerical 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
many 
people. 
But 
here 
is 
an 
instance 
somewhat 
similar, 
which 
willservetodisabusethem. 
30. 
The 
celebrated 
Kepler 
and 
M. 
Descartes 
(in 
his 
letters) 
after 
him 
have 
spoken 
of 
the 
‘natural 
inertia 
of 
bodies’; 
and 
it 
is 
something 
which 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
perfect 
image 
and 
even 
as 
a 
sample 
of 
the 
original 
limitation 
of 
creatures, 
to 
show 
that 
privation 
constitutes 
the 
formal 
character 
of 
the 
imperfections 
and 
disadvantages 
that 
are 
in 
substance 
aswellas 
in 
its 
actions. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
that 
the 
current 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
river 
carried 
along 
with 
it 

various 
boats, 
which 
differ 
among 
themselves 
only 
in 
the 
cargo, 
some 
being 
laden 
with 
wood, 
others 
with 
stone, 
and 
some 
more, 
the 
others 
less. 
That 
being 
so, 
it 
will 
come 
about 
that 
the 
boats 
most 
heavily 
laden 
will 
go 
more 
slowly 
than 
the 
others, 
provided 
it 
be 
assumed 
that 
the 
wind 
or 
the 
oar, 
or 
some 
other 
similar 
means, 
assist 
them 
not 
at 
all. 
It 
is 
not, 
properly 
speaking, 
weight 
which 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
retardation, 
since 
the 
boats 
are 
going 
down 
and 
not 
upwards; 
but 
it 
is 
the 
same 
cause 
which 
also 
increases 
the 
weight 
in 
bodies 
that 
have 
greater 
density, 
which 
are, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
less 
porous 
and 
more 
charged 
with 
matter 
that 
is 
proper 
to 
them: 
for 
the 
matter 
which 
passes 
through 
the 
pores, 
not 
receiving 
the 
same 
movement, 
must 
not 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
It 
is 
therefore 
matter 
itself 
which 
originally 
is 
inclined 
to 
slowness 
or 
privation 
of 
speed; 
not 
indeed 
of 
itself 
to 
lessen 
this 
speed, 
having 
once 
received 
it, 
since 
that 
would 
be 
action, 
but 
to 
moderate 
by 
its 
receptivity 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
impression 
when 
it 
is 
to 
receive 
it. 
Consequently, 
since 
more 
matter 
is 
movedby 
thesame 
force 
of 
thecurrent 
when 
theboatis 
more 
laden, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
go 
more 
slowly; 
and 
experiments 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
bodies, 
as 
well 
as 
reason, 
show 
that 
twice 
as 
much 
force 
must 
be 
employed 
to 
give 
equal 
speed 
to 
a 
body 
of 
the 
same 
matter 
but 
of 
twice 
the 
size. 
But 
that 
indeedwould 
notbe 
necessary 
ifthematterwereabsolutelyindifferentto 
repose 
and 
to 
movement, 
and 
if 
it 
had 
not 
this 
natural 
inertia 
whereof 
we 
have 
just 
spoken 
to 
give 
it 
a 
kind 
of 
repugnance 
to 
being 
moved. 
Let 
us 
now 
compare 
the 
force 
which 
the 
current 
exercises 
on 
boats, 
and 
communicates 
to 
them, 
with 
the 
action 
of 
God, 
who 
produces 
and 
conserves 
whatever 
is 
positive 
in 
creatures, 
and 
gives 
them 
perfection, 
being 
and 
force: 
let 
us 
compare, 
I 
say, 
the 
inertia 
of 
matter 
with 
the 
natural 
imperfection 
of 
creatures, 
and 
the 
slowness 
of 
the 
laden 
boat 
with 
the 
defects 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
qualities 
and 
the 
action 
of 
the 
creature; 
and 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
so 
just 
as 
this 
comparison. 
The 
current 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
boat’s 



movement, 
but 
not 
of 
its 
retardation; 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
perfection 
in 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
creature, 
but 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
receptivity 
of 
the 
creature 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
defects 
there 
are 
in 
its 
action. 
Thus 
the 
Platonists, 
St. 
Augustine 
and 
the 
Schoolmen 
were 
right 
to 
say 
that 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
material 
element 
of 
evil 
which 
lies 
in 
the 
positive, 
and 
not 
of 
the 
formal 
element, 
which 
lies 
in 
privation. 
Even 
so 
one 
may 
say 
that 
the 
current 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
material 
element 
of 
the 
retardation, 
but 
not 
of 
the 
formal: 
that 
is, 
it 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
boat’s 
speed 
without 
being 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
limits 
to 
this 
speed. 
And 
God 
is 
no 
more 
the 
cause 
of 
sin 
than 
the 
river’s 
current 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
retardation 
of 
the 
boat. 
Force 
also 
in 
relation 
to 
matter 
is 
as 
thespiritinrelationto 
theflesh;thespiritis 
willingandthefleshisweak,and 
spirits 
act... 


quantum 
non 
noxia 
corpora 
tardant. 


31. 
There 
is, 
then, 
a 
wholly 
similar 
relation 
between 
such 
and 
such 
an 
action 
of 
God, 
and 
such 
and 
such 
a 
passion 
or 
reception 
of 
the 
creature, 
which 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
things 
is 
perfected 
only 
in 
proportion 
to 
its 
‘receptivity’, 
such 
is 
the 
term 
used. 
And 
when 
it 
is 
said 
that 
the 
creature 
depends 
upon 
God 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
exists 
and 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
acts, 
and 
even 
that 
conservation 
is 
a 
continual 
creation, 
this 
is 
true 
in 
that 
God 
gives 
ever 
to 
the 
creature 
and 
produces 
continually 
all 
that 
in 
it 
is 
positive, 
good 
and 
perfect, 
every 
perfect 
gift 
coming 
from 
the 
Father 
of 
lights. 
The 
imperfections, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
and 
the 
defects 
in 
operations 
spring 
from 
the 
original 
limitation 
that 
the 
creature 
could 
not 
but 
receive 
with 
the 
first 
beginning 
of 
its 
being, 
through 
the 
ideal 
reasons 
which 
restrict 
it. 
For 
God 
could 
not 
give 
the 
creature 
all 
without 
making 
of 
it 
a 
God; 
therefore 
there 
must 
needs 
be 
different 
degrees 
in 
the 
perfection 
of 
things, 
and 
limitations 
also 
of 
every 
kind. 

32. 
This 
consideration 
will 
serve 
also 
to 
satisfy 
some 
modern 
philosophers 
who 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
say 
that 
God 
is 
the 
only 
agent. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
God 
is 
the 
only 
one 
whose 
action 
is 
pure 
and 
without 
admixture 
of 
what 
is 
termed 
‘to 
suffer’:but 
that 
does 
notprecludethe 
creature’s 
participationinactions,since 
the 
action 
of 
the 
creature 
isa 
modificationof 
thesubstance,flowing 
naturally 
from 
it 
and 
containing 
a 
variation 
not 
only 
in 
the 
perfections 
that 
God 
has 
communicated 
to 
the 
creature, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
limitations 
that 
the 
creature, 
being 
what 
it 
is, 
brings 
with 
it. 
Thus 
we 
see 
that 
there 
is 
an 
actual 
distinction 
between 
the 
substance 
and 
its 
modification 
or 
accidents, 
contrary 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
some 
moderns 
and 
in 
particular 
of 
the 
late 
Duke 
of 
Buckingham, 
who 
spoke 
of 
that 
in 
a 
little 
Discourse 
on 
Religion 
recently 
reprinted. 
Evil 
is 
therefore 
like 
darkness, 
and 
not 
only 
ignorance 
but 
also 
error 
and 
malice 
consist 
formally 
in 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
privation. 
Here 
is 
an 
example 
of 
error 
which 
we 
have 
already 
employed. 
I 
see 
a 
tower 
which 
from 
a 
distance 
appears 
round 
although 
it 
is 
square. 
The 
thought 
that 
the 
tower 
is 
what 
it 
appears 
to 
be 
flows 
naturally 
from 
that 
which 
I 
see; 
and 
when 
I 
dwell 
on 
this 
thought 
it 
is 
an 
affirmation, 
it 
is 
a 
false 
judgement; 
but 
if 
I 
pursue 
the 
examination, 
if 
some 
reflexion 
causes 
me 
to 
perceive 
that 
appearances 
deceive 
me, 
lo 
and 
behold, 
I 
abandon 
my 
error. 
To 
abide 
in 
a 
certain 
place, 
or 
nottogo 
further,nottoespy 
somelandmark,theseareprivations. 
33. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
in 
respect 
of 
malice 
or 
ill 
will. 
The 
will 
tends 
towards 
good 
in 
general, 
it 
must 
strive 
after 
the 
perfection 
that 
befits 
us, 
and 
the 
supreme 
perfection 
is 
in 
God. 
All 
pleasures 
have 
within 
themselves 
some 
feeling 
of 
perfection. 
But 
when 
one 
is 
limited 
to 
the 
pleasures 
of 
the 
senses, 
or 
to 
other 
pleasures 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
greater 
good, 
as 
of 
health, 
of 
virtue, 
of 
union 
with 
God, 
of 
felicity, 
it 
is 
in 
this 
privation 
of 
a 
further 
aspiration 
that 
the 
defect 
consists. 
In 
general 
perfection 
is 
positive, 
it 
is 
an 
absolute 
reality; 
defect 
is 
privative, 
it 
comes 
from 
limitation 
and 
tends 
towards 
new 

privations. 
This 
saying 
is 
therefore 
as 
true 
as 
it 
is 
ancient: 
bonum 
ex 
causa 
integra, 
malum 
ex 
quolibet 
defectu; 
as 
also 
that 
which 
states: 
malum 
causam 
habet 
non 
efficientem, 
sed 
deficientem. 
And 
I 
hope 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
these 
axiomswillbebetter 
apprehendedafterwhatIhavejustsaid. 


34. 
The 
physical 
co-operation 
of 
God 
and 
of 
creatures 
with 
the 
will 
contributes 
also 
to 
the 
difficulties 
existing 
in 
regard 
to 
freedom. 
I 
am 
of 
opinion 
that 
our 
will 
is 
exempt 
not 
only 
from 
constraint 
but 
also 
from 
necessity. 
Aristotle 
has 
already 
observed 
that 
there 
are 
two 
things 
in 
freedom, 
to 
wit, 
spontaneity 
and 
choice, 
and 
therein 
lies 
our 
mastery 
over 
our 
actions. 
When 
we 
act 
freely 
we 
are 
not 
being 
forced, 
as 
would 
happen 
if 
we 
were 
pushed 
on 
to 
a 
precipice 
and 
thrown 
from 
top 
to 
bottom; 
and 
we 
are 
not 
prevented 
from 
having 
the 
mind 
free 
when 
we 
deliberate, 
as 
would 
happen 
if 
we 
were 
given 
a 
draught 
to 
deprive 
us 
of 
discernment. 
There 
is 
contingency 
in 
a 
thousand 
actions 
of 
Nature; 
but 
when 
there 
is 
no 
judgement 
in 
him 
who 
acts 
there 
is 
no 
freedom. 
And 
if 
we 
had 
judgement 
not 
accompanied 
by 
any 
inclination 
toact,oursoulwouldbean 
understandingwithoutwill. 
35. 
It 
is 
not 
to 
be 
imagined, 
however, 
that 
our 
freedom 
consists 
in 
an 
indetermination 
or 
an 
indifference 
of 
equipoise, 
as 
if 
one 
must 
needs 
be 
inclined 
equally 
to 
the 
side 
of 
yes 
and 
of 
no 
and 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
different 
courses, 
when 
there 
are 
several 
of 
them 
to 
take. 
This 
equipoise 
in 
all 
directions 
is 
impossible: 
for 
if 
we 
were 
equally 
inclined 
towards 
the 
courses 
A, 
B 
and 
C, 
we 
could 
not 
be 
equally 
inclined 
towards 
A 
and 
towards 
not 
A. 
This 
equipoise 
is 
also 
absolutely 
contrary 
to 
experience, 
and 
in 
scrutinizing 
oneself 
one 
will 
find 
that 
there 
has 
always 
been 
some 
cause 
or 
reason 
inclining 
us 
towards 
the 
course 
taken, 
although 
very 
often 
we 
be 
not 
aware 
of 
that 
which 
prompts 
us: 
just 
in 
the 
same 
way 
one 
is 
hardly 
aware 
why, 
on 
issuing 
from 
a 
door, 
one 
has 
placed 
the 
right 
foot 
before 
the 
left 
or 
the 
left 
beforetheright. 

36. 
But 
let 
us 
pass 
to 
the 
difficulties. 
Philosophers 
agree 
to-day 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
contingent 
futurities 
is 
determinate, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
that 
contingent 
futurities 
are 
future, 
or 
that 
they 
will 
be, 
that 
they 
will 
happen: 
for 
it 
is 
as 
sure 
that 
the 
future 
will 
be, 
as 
it 
is 
sure 
that 
the 
past 
has 
been. 
It 
was 
true 
already 
a 
hundred 
years 
ago 
that 
I 
should 
write 
to-day, 
as 
it 
will 
be 
true 
after 
a 
hundred 
years 
that 
I 
have 
written. 
Thus 
the 
contingent 
is 
not, 
because 
it 
is 
future, 
any 
the 
less 
contingent; 
and 
determination, 
which 
would 
be 
called 
certainty 
if 
it 
were 
known, 
is 
not 
incompatible 
with 
contingency. 
Often 
the 
certain 
and 
the 
determinate 
are 
taken 
as 
one 
thing, 
because 
a 
determinate 
truth 
is 
capable 
of 
beingknown:thus 
itmay 
besaidthatdeterminationis 
an 
objectivecertainty. 
37. 
This 
determination 
comes 
from 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
truth, 
and 
cannot 
injure 
freedom: 
but 
there 
are 
other 
determinations 
taken 
from 
elsewhere, 
and 
inthefirstplace 
fromthe 
foreknowledgeof 
God,whichmanyhaveheldtobe 
contrary 
to 
freedom. 
They 
say 
that 
what 
is 
foreseen 
cannot 
fail 
to 
exist, 
and 
they 
say 
so 
truly; 
but 
it 
follows 
not 
that 
what 
is 
foreseen 
is 
necessary, 
for 
necessary 
truth 
is 
that 
whereof 
the 
contrary 
is 
impossible 
or 
implies 
contradiction. 
Now 
this 
truth 
which 
states 
that 
I 
shall 
write 
tomorrow 
is 
not 
of 
that 
nature, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary. 
Yet 
supposing 
that 
God 
foresees 
it, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
it 
come 
to 
pass; 
that 
is, 
the 
consequence 
is 
necessary, 
namely, 
that 
it 
exist, 
since 
it 
has 
been 
foreseen; 
for 
God 
is 
infallible. 
This 
is 
what 
is 
termed 
a 
hypothetical 
necessity. 
But 
our 
concern 
is 
not 
this 
necessity: 
it 
is 
an 
absolute 
necessity 
that 
is 
required, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
say 
that 
an 
action 
is 
necessary, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
contingent, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
free 
choice. 
Besides 
it 
is 
very 
easily 
seen 
that 
foreknowledge 
in 
itself 
adds 
nothing 
to 
the 
determinationofthetruth 
ofcontingent 
futurities,savethatthis 
determination 
is 
known: 
and 
this 
does 
not 
augment 
the 
determination 
or 
the 
‘futurition’ 
(as 
it 
istermed)oftheseevents,thatwhereonweagreedat 
the 
outset. 

38. 
This 
answer 
is 
doubtless 
very 
correct. 
It 
is 
agreed 
that 
foreknowledge 
in 
itself 
does 
not 
make 
truth 
more 
determinate; 
truth 
is 
foreseen 
because 
it 
is 
determinate, 
because 
it 
is 
true; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
true 
because 
it 
is 
foreseen: 
and 
therein 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
future 
has 
nothing 
that 
is 
not 
also 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past 
or 
of 
the 
present. 
But 
here 
is 
what 
an 
opponent 
will 
be 
able 
to 
say: 
I 
grant 
you 
that 
foreknowledge 
in 
itself 
does 
not 
make 
truth 
more 
determinate, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
foreknowledge 
that 
makes 
it 
so. 
For 
it 
needs 
must 
be 
that 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
God 
have 
its 
foundation 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
this 
foundation, 
making 
the 
truth 
predeterminate, 
will 
preventit 
from 
being 
contingentandfree. 
39. 
It 
is 
this 
difficulty 
that 
has 
caused 
two 
parties 
to 
spring 
up, 
one 
of 
the 
predeterminators, 
the 
other 
of 
the 
supporters 
of 
mediate 
knowledge. 
The 
Dominicans 
and 
the 
Augustinians 
are 
for 
predetermination, 
the 
Franciscans 
and 
the 
modern 
Jesuits 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
are 
for 
mediate 
knowledge. 
These 
two 
parties 
appeared 
towards 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century 
and 
a 
little 
later. 
Molina 
himself, 
who 
is 
perhaps 
one 
of 
the 
first, 
with 
Fonseca, 
to 
have 
systematized 
this 
point, 
and 
from 
whom 
the 
others 
derived 
their 
name 
of 
Molinists, 
says 
in 
thebook 
that 
he 
wrote 
on 
the 
reconciliation 
offreewill 
with 
grace, 
about 
the 
year 
1570, 
that 
the 
Spanish 
doctors 
(he 
means 
principally 
the 
Thomists), 
who 
had 
been 
writing 
then 
for 
twenty 
years, 
finding 
no 
other 
way 
to 
explain 
how 
God 
could 
have 
a 
certain 
knowledge 
of 
contingent 
futurities, 
had 
introducedpredeterminationasbeingnecessaryto 
freeactions. 
40. 
As 
for 
himself, 
he 
thought 
to 
have 
found 
another 
way. 
He 
considers 
that 
there 
are 
three 
objects 
of 
divine 
knowledge, 
the 
possibles, 
the 
actual 
events 
and 
the 
conditional 
events 
that 
would 
happen 
in 
consequence 
of 
a 
certain 
condition 
if 
it 
were 
translated 
into 
action. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
possibilities 
is 
what 
is 
called 
the 
‘knowledge 
of 
mere 
intelligence’; 
that 
of 
events 
occurring 
actually 
in 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
called 
the 

‘knowledge 
of 
intuition’. 
And 
as 
there 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
mean 
between 
the 
merely 
possible 
and 
the 
pure 
and 
absolute 
event, 
to 
wit, 
the 
conditional 
event, 
it 
can 
be 
said 
also, 
according 
to 
Molina, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
mediate 
knowledge 
between 
that 
of 
intuition 
and 
that 
of 
intelligence. 
Instance 
is 
given 
of 
the 
famous 
example 
of 
David 
asking 
the 
divine 
oracle 
whether 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
town 
of 
Keilah, 
where 
he 
designed 
to 
shut 
himself 
in, 
would 
deliver 
him 
to 
Saul, 
supposing 
that 
Saul 
should 
besiege 
the 
town. 
God 
answered 
yes; 
whereupon 
David 
took 
a 
different 
course. 
Now 
some 
advocates 
of 
this 
mediate 
knowledge 
are 
of 
opinion 
that 
God, 
foreseeing 
what 
men 
would 
do 
of 
their 
own 
accord, 
supposing 
they 
were 
placed 
in 
such 
and 
such 
circumstances, 
and 
knowing 
that 
they 
would 
make 
ill 
use 
of 
their 
free 
will, 
decrees 
to 
refuse 
them 
grace 
and 
favourable 
circumstances. 
And 
he 
may 
justly 
so 
decree, 
since 
in 
any 
case 
these 
circumstances 
and 
these 
aids 
would 
not 
have 
served 
them 
aught. 
But 
Molina 
contents 
himself 
with 
finding 
therein 
generally 
a 
reason 
for 
the 
decrees 
of 
God, 
founded 
on 
what 
the 
free

andsuch

41. 
I 
will 
not 
enter 
into 
all 
the 
detail 
of 
this 
controversy; 
it 
will 
suffice 
for 
metogive 
oneinstance. 
Certainolderwriters, 
notacceptabletoSt. 
Augustine 
and 
his 
first 
disciples, 
appear 
to 
have 
had 
ideas 
somewhat 
approaching 
those 
of 
Molina. 
The 
Thomists 
and 
those 
who 
call 
themselves 
disciples 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
(but 
whom 
their 
opponents 
call 
Jansenists) 
combat 
this 
doctrine 
on 
philosophical 
and 
theological 
grounds. 
Some 
maintain 
that 
mediate 
knowledge 
must 
be 
included 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
mere 
intelligence. 
But 
the 
principal 
objection 
is 
aimed 
at 
the 
foundation 
of 
this 
knowledge. 
For 
what 
foundation 
can 
God 
have 
for 
seeing 
what 
the 
people 
of 
Keilah 
would 
do? 
A 
simple 
contingent 
and 
free 
act 
has 
nothing 
in 
itself 
to 
yield 
a 
principle 
of 
certainty, 
unless 
one 
look 
upon 
it 
as 
predetermined 
by 
the 
decrees 
of 
God, 
and 
by 
the 
causes 
that 
are 
dependent 
upon 
them. 
Consequently 
the 
difficulty 

existing 
in 
actual 
free 
actions 
will 
exist 
also 
in 
conditional 
free 
actions, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
God 
will 
know 
them 
only 
under 
the 
condition 
of 
their 
causes 
and 
of 
his 
decrees, 
which 
are 
the 
first 
causes 
of 
things: 
and 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
separate 
such 
actions 
from 
those 
causes 
so 
as 
to 
know 
a 
contingent 
event 
in 
a 
way 
that 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
its 
causes. 
Therefore 
all 
must 
of 
necessity 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
the 
predetermination 
of 
God’s 
decrees, 
and 
this 
mediate 
knowledge 
(so 
it 
will 
be 
said) 
will 
offer 
no 
remedy. 
The 
theologians 
who 
profess 
to 
be 
adherents 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
claim 
also 
that 
the 
system 
of 
the 
Molinists 
would 
discover 
the 
source 
of 
God’s 
grace 
in 
the 
good 
qualities 
of 
man, 
and 
this 
they 
deem 
an 
infringement 
of 
God’s 
honour 
and 
contrary 
to 
St. 
Paul’s 
teaching. 


42. 
It 
would 
be 
long 
and 
wearisome 
to 
enter 
here 
into 
the 
replies 
and 
rejoinders 
coming 
from 
one 
side 
and 
the 
other, 
and 
it 
will 
suffice 
for 
me 
to 
explain 
how 
I 
conceive 
that 
there 
is 
truth 
on 
both 
sides. 
For 
this 
result 
I 
resort 
to 
my 
principle 
of 
an 
infinitude 
of 
possible 
worlds, 
represented 
in 
the 
region 
of 
eternal 
verities, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
object 
of 
the 
divine 
intelligence, 
where 
all 
conditional 
futurities 
must 
be 
comprised. 
For 
the 
case 
of 
the 
siege 
of 
Keilah 
forms 
part 
of 
a 
possible 
world, 
which 
differs 
from 
ours 
only 
in 
all 
that 
is 
connected 
with 
this 
hypothesis, 
and 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
possible 
world 
represents 
that 
whichwouldhappeninthiscase. 
Thuswehavea 
principleforthecertain 
knowledge 
of 
contingent 
futurities, 
whether 
they 
happen 
actually 
or 
must 
happen 
in 
a 
certain 
case. 
For 
in 
the 
region 
of 
the 
possibles 
they 
are 
represented 
as 
they 
are, 
namely, 
as 
free 
contingencies. 
Therefore 
neither 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
contingent 
futurities 
nor 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
certainty 
of 
this 
foreknowledge 
should 
cause 
us 
perplexity 
or 
seem 
to 
prejudice 
freedom. 
And 
though 
it 
were 
true 
and 
possible 
that 
contingent 
futurities 
consisting 
in 
free 
actions 
of 
reasonable 
creatures 
were 
entirely 
independent 
of 
the 
decrees 
ofGodandofexternalcauses, 
therewouldstillbemeansofforeseeingthem; 

for 
God 
would 
see 
them 
as 
they 
are 
in 
the 
region 
of 
the 
possibles, 
before 
he 
decreestoadmittheminto 
existence. 


43. 
But 
if 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
God 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
dependence 
or 
independence 
of 
our 
free 
actions, 
it 
is 
not 
so 
with 
the 
foreordinance 
of 
God, 
his 
decrees, 
and 
the 
sequence 
of 
causes 
which, 
as 
I 
believe, 
alwayscontribute 
tothe 
determinationof 
thewill. 
And 
if 
I 
am 
for 
the 
Molinists 
in 
the 
first 
point, 
I 
am 
for 
the 
predeterminators 
in 
the 
second, 
provided 
always 
that 
predetermination 
be 
taken 
as 
not 
necessitating. 
In 
a 
word, 
I 
am 
of 
opinion 
that 
the 
will 
is 
always 
more 
inclined 
towards 
the 
course 
it 
adopts, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
never 
bound 
by 
the 
necessity 
to 
adopt 
it. 
That 
it 
will 
adopt 
this 
course 
is 
certain, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
necessary. 
The 
case 
corresponds 
to 
that 
of 
the 
famous 
saying, 
Astra 
inclinant, 
non 
necessitant, 
although 
here 
the 
similarity 
is 
not 
complete. 
For 
the 
event 
towards 
which 
the 
stars 
tend 
(to 
speak 
with 
the 
common 
herd, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
some 
foundation 
for 
astrology) 
does 
not 
always 
come 
to 
pass, 
whereas 
the 
course 
towards 
which 
the 
will 
is 
more 
inclined 
never 
fails 
to 
be 
adopted. 
Moreover 
the 
stars 
would 
form 
only 
a 
part 
of 
the 
inclinations 
that 
co-operate 
in 
the 
event, 
but 
when 
one 
speaks 
of 
the 
greater 
inclination 
of 
the 
will, 
one 
speaks 
of 
the 
result 
of 
all 
the 
inclinations. 
It 
is 
almost 
as 
we 
have 
spoken 
above 
of 
the 
consequent 
will 
in 
God, 
whichresultsfromalltheantecedentwills. 
44. 
Nevertheless, 
objective 
certainty 
or 
determination 
does 
not 
bring 
about 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
determinate 
truth. 
All 
philosophers 
acknowledge 
this, 
asserting 
that 
the 
truth 
of 
contingent 
futurities 
is 
determinate, 
and 
that 
nevertheless 
they 
remain 
contingent. 
The 
thing 
indeed 
would 
imply 
no 
contradiction 
in 
itself 
if 
the 
effect 
did 
not 
follow; 
and 
therein 
lies 
contingency. 
The 
better 
to 
understand 
this 
point, 
we 
must 
take 
into 
account 
that 
there 
are 
two 
great 
principles 
of 
our 
arguments. 
The 
one 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction, 
stating 
that 
of 
two 
contradictory 
propositions 
the 
one 
is 
true, 

the 
other 
false; 
the 
other 
principle 
is 
that 
of 
the 
determinant 
reason: 
it 
states 
that 
nothing 
ever 
comes 
to 
pass 
without 
there 
being 
a 
cause 
or 
at 
least 
a 
reason 
determining 
it, 
that 
is, 
something 
to 
give 
an 
a 
priori 
reason 
why 
it 
is 
existent 
rather 
than 
non-existent, 
and 
in 
this 
wise 
rather 
than 
in 
any 
other. 
This 
great 
principle 
holds 
for 
all 
events, 
and 
a 
contrary 
instance 
will 
never 
be 
supplied: 
and 
although 
more 
often 
than 
not 
we 
are 
insufficiently 
acquainted 
with 
these 
determinant 
reasons, 
we 
perceive 
nevertheless 
that 
there 
are 
such. 
Were 
it 
not 
for 
this 
great 
principle 
we 
could 
never 
prove 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
and 
we 
should 
lose 
an 
infinitude 
of 
very 
just 
and 
very 
profitable 
arguments 
whereof 
it 
is 
the 
foundation; 
moreover, 
it 
suffers 
no 
exception, 
for 
otherwise 
its 
force 
would 
be 
weakened. 
Besides, 
nothing 
is 
so 
weak 
as 
those 
systems 
where 
all 
is 
unsteady 
and 
full 
of 
exceptions. 
That 
fault 
cannot 
be 
laid 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
system 
I 
approve, 
where 
everything 
happens 
in 
accordancewithgeneralrules 
thatatmostaremutuallyrestrictive. 


45. 
We 
must 
therefore 
not 
imagine 
with 
some 
Schoolmen, 
whose 
ideas 
tend 
towards 
the 
chimerical, 
that 
free 
contingent 
futurities 
have 
the 
privilege 
of 
exemption 
from 
this 
general 
rule 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 
There 
is 
always 
a 
prevailing 
reason 
which 
prompts 
the 
will 
to 
its 
choice, 
and 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
freedom 
for 
the 
will 
it 
suffices 
that 
this 
reason 
should 
incline 
without 
necessitating. 
That 
is 
also 
the 
opinion 
of 
all 
the 
ancients, 
of 
Plato, 
of 
Aristotle, 
of 
St. 
Augustine. 
The 
will 
is 
never 
prompted 
to 
action 
save 
by 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
good, 
which 
prevails 
over 
the 
opposite 
representations. 
This 
is 
admitted 
even 
in 
relation 
to 
God, 
the 
good 
angels 
and 
the 
souls 
in 
bliss: 
and 
it 
is 
acknowledged 
that 
they 
are 
none 
the 
less 
free 
in 
consequence 
of 
that. 
God 
fails 
not 
to 
choose 
the 
best, 
but 
he 
is 
not 
constrained 
so 
to 
do: 
nay, 
more, 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
in 
the 
object 
of 
God’s 
choice, 
for 
another 
sequence 
of 
things 
is 
equally 
possible. 
For 
that 
very 
reason 
the 
choice 
is 
free 
and 
independent 
of 
necessity, 
because 
it 
is 
made 
between 
several 
possibles, 

and 
the 
will 
is 
determined 
only 
by 
the 
preponderating 
goodness 
of 
the 
object. 
This 
is 
therefore 
not 
a 
defect 
where 
God 
and 
the 
saints 
are 
concerned: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
great 
defect, 
or 
rather 
a 
manifest 
absurdity, 
were 
it 
otherwise, 
even 
in 
men 
here 
on 
earth, 
and 
if 
they 
were 
capable 
of 
acting 
without 
any 
inclining 
reason. 
Of 
such 
absurdity 
no 
example 
will 
ever 
be 
found; 
and 
even 
supposing 
one 
takes 
a 
certain 
course 
out 
of 
caprice, 
to 
demonstrate 
one’s 
freedom, 
the 
pleasure 
or 
advantage 
one 
thinks 
to 
find 
in 
this 
conceitisoneofthereasonstendingtowardsit. 


46. 
There 
is 
therefore 
a 
freedom 
of 
contingency 
or, 
in 
a 
way, 
of 
indifference, 
provided 
that 
by 
‘indifference’ 
is 
understood 
that 
nothing 
necessitates 
us 
to 
one 
course 
or 
the 
other; 
but 
there 
is 
never 
any 
indifference 
of 
equipoise, 
that 
is, 
where 
all 
is 
completely 
even 
on 
both 
sides, 
without 
any 
inclination 
towards 
either. 
Innumerable 
great 
and 
small 
movements, 
internal 
and 
external, 
co-operate 
with 
us, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
unperceived 
by 
us. 
And 
I 
have 
already 
said 
that 
when 
one 
leaves 
a 
room 
there 
are 
such 
and 
such 
reasons 
determining 
us 
to 
put 
the 
one 
foot 
first, 
without 
pausing 
to 
reflect. 
For 
there 
is 
not 
everywhere 
a 
slave, 
as 
in 
Trimalchio’s 
house 
in 
Petronius, 
to 
cry 
to 
us: 
the 
right 
foot 
first. 
All 
that 
we 
have 
just 
said 
agrees 
entirely 
also 
with 
the 
maxims 
of 
the 
philosophers, 
who 
teach 
that 
a 
cause 
cannot 
act 
without 
having 
a 
disposition 
towards 
action. 
It 
is 
this 
disposition 
which 
contains 
a 
predetermination, 
whether 
the 
doer 
have 
received 
it 
from 
without, 
orhave 
haditinconsequenceofhisownantecedentcharacter. 
47. 
Thus 
we 
have 
no 
need 
to 
resort, 
in 
company 
with 
some 
new 
Thomists, 
to 
a 
new 
immediate 
predetermination 
by 
God, 
such 
as 
may 
cause 
the 
free 
creature 
to 
abandon 
his 
indifference, 
and 
to 
a 
decree 
of 
God 
for 
predetermining 
the 
creature, 
making 
it 
possible 
for 
God 
to 
know 
what 
the 
creature 
will 
do: 
for 
it 
suffices 
that 
the 
creature 
be 
predetermined 
by 
its 
preceding 
state, 
which 
inclines 
it 
to 
one 
course 
more 
than 
to 
the 
other. 

Moreover, 
all 
these 
connexions 
of 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
creature 
and 
of 
all 
creatures 
were 
represented 
in 
the 
divine 
understanding, 
and 
known 
to 
God 
through 
the 
knowledge 
of 
mere 
intelligence, 
before 
he 
had 
decreed 
to 
give 
them 
existence. 
Thus 
we 
see 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
account 
for 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
God, 
one 
may 
dispense 
with 
both 
the 
mediate 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Molinists 
and 
the 
predetermination 
which 
a 
Bañez 
or 
an 
Alvarez 
(writers 
otherwise 
of 
greatprofundity)have 
taught. 


48. 
By 
this 
false 
idea 
of 
an 
indifference 
of 
equipoise 
the 
Molinists 
were 
much 
embarrassed. 
They 
were 
asked 
not 
only 
how 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
know 
in 
what 
direction 
a 
cause 
absolutely 
indeterminate 
would 
be 
determined, 
but 
also 
how 
it 
was 
possible 
that 
there 
should 
finally 
result 
therefrom 
a 
determination 
for 
which 
there 
is 
no 
source: 
to 
say 
with 
Molina 
that 
it 
is 
the 
privilege 
of 
the 
free 
cause 
is 
to 
say 
nothing, 
but 
simply 
to 
grant 
that 
cause 
the 
privilege 
of 
being 
chimerical. 
It 
is 
pleasing 
to 
see 
their 
harassed 
efforts 
to 
emergefromalabyrinthwhencethereisabsolutelyno 
meansofegress. 
Some 
teach 
that 
the 
will, 
before 
it 
is 
determined 
formally, 
must 
be 
determined 
virtually, 
in 
order 
to 
emerge 
from 
its 
state 
of 
equipoise; 
and 
Father 
Louis 
of 
Dole, 
in 
his 
book 
on 
the 
Co-operation 
of 
God, 
quotes 
Molinists 
who 
attempt 
to 
take 
refuge 
in 
this 
expedient: 
for 
they 
are 
compelled 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
cause 
must 
needs 
be 
disposed 
to 
act. 
But 
they 
gain 
nothing, 
they 
only 
deferthedifficulty: 
fortheywillstillbeaskedhowthefreecause 
comestobe 
determined 
virtually. 
They 
will 
therefore 
never 
extricate 
themselves 
without 
acknowledging 
that 
there 
is 
a 
predetermination 
in 
the 
preceding 
state 
of 
the 
freecreature,whichinclines 
itto 
bedetermined. 
49. 
In 
consequence 
of 
this, 
the 
case 
also 
of 
Buridan’s 
ass 
between 
two 
meadows, 
impelled 
equally 
towards 
both 
of 
them, 
is 
a 
fiction 
that 
cannot 
occur 
in 
the 
universe, 
in 
the 
order 
of 
Nature, 
although 
M. 
Bayle 
be 
of 
another 
opinion. 
It 
is 
true 
that, 
if 
the 
case 
were 
possible, 
one 
must 
say 
that 
the 
ass 

would 
starve 
himself 
to 
death: 
but 
fundamentally 
the 
question 
deals 
in 
the 
impossible, 
unless 
it 
be 
that 
God 
bring 
the 
thing 
about 
expressly. 
For 
the 
universe 
cannot 
be 
halved 
by 
a 
plane 
drawn 
through 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
ass, 
which 
is 
cut 
vertically 
through 
its 
length, 
so 
that 
all 
is 
equal 
and 
alike 
on 
both 
sides, 
in 
the 
manner 
wherein 
an 
ellipse, 
and 
every 
plane 
figure 
of 
the 
number 
of 
those 
I 
term 
‘ambidexter’, 
can 
be 
thus 
halved, 
by 
any 
straight 
line 
passing 
through 
its 
centre. 
Neither 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
universe 
nor 
the 
viscera 
of 
the 
animal 
are 
alike 
nor 
are 
they 
evenly 
placed 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
this 
vertical 
plane. 
There 
will 
therefore 
always 
be 
many 
things 
in 
the 
ass 
and 
outside 
the 
ass, 
although 
they 
be 
not 
apparent 
to 
us, 
which 
will 
determine 
him 
to 
go 
on 
one 
side 
rather 
than 
the 
other. 
And 
although 
man 
is 
free, 
and 
the 
ass 
is 
not, 
nevertheless 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
it 
must 
be 
true 
that 
in 
man 
likewise 
the 
case 
of 
a 
perfect 
equipoise 
between 
two 
courses 
is 
impossible. 
Furthermore 
it 
is 
true 
that 
an 
angel, 
or 
God 
certainly, 
could 
always 
account 
for 
the 
course 
man 
hasadopted, 
by 
assigning 
a 
cause 
or 
a 
predisposing 
reason 
which 
has 
actually 
induced 
him 
to 
adopt 
it: 
yet 
this 
reason 
would 
often 
be 
complex 
and 
incomprehensible 
to 
ourselves, 
because 
the 
concatenation 
of 
causes 
linked 
together 
isverylong. 


50. 
Hence 
it 
is 
that 
the 
reason 
M. 
Descartes 
has 
advanced 
to 
prove 
the 
independence 
of 
our 
free 
actions, 
by 
what 
he 
terms 
an 
intense 
inward 
sensation, 
has 
no 
force. 
We 
cannot 
properly 
speaking 
be 
sensible 
of 
our 
independence, 
and 
we 
are 
not 
aware 
always 
of 
the 
causes, 
often 
imperceptible, 
whereon 
our 
resolution 
depends. 
It 
is 
as 
though 
the 
magnetic 
needle 
took 
pleasure 
in 
turning 
towards 
the 
north: 
for 
it 
would 
think 
that 
it 
was 
turning 
independently 
of 
any 
other 
cause, 
not 
being 
aware 
of 
the 
imperceptible 
movements 
of 
the 
magnetic 
matter. 
Nevertheless 
we 
shall 
see 
later 
in 
what 
sense 
it 
is 
quite 
true 
that 
the 
human 
soul 
is 
altogether 
its 
own 

natural 
principle 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
actions, 
dependent 
upon 
itself 
and 
independentofallothercreatures. 


51. 
As 
for 
volition 
itself, 
to 
say 
that 
it 
is 
an 
object 
of 
free 
will 
is 
incorrect. 
We 
will 
to 
act, 
strictly 
speaking, 
and 
we 
do 
not 
will 
to 
will; 
else 
we 
could 
still 
say 
that 
we 
will 
to 
have 
the 
will 
to 
will, 
and 
that 
would 
go 
on 
to 
infinity. 
Besides, 
we 
do 
not 
always 
follow 
the 
latest 
judgement 
of 
practical 
understanding 
when 
we 
resolve 
to 
will; 
but 
we 
always 
follow, 
in 
our 
willing, 
the 
result 
of 
all 
the 
inclinations 
that 
come 
from 
the 
direction 
both 
of 
reasons 
and 
passions, 
and 
this 
often 
happens 
without 
an 
express 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding. 
52. 
All 
is 
therefore 
certain 
and 
determined 
beforehand 
in 
man, 
as 
everywhere 
else, 
and 
the 
human 
soul 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
spiritual 
automaton, 
although 
contingent 
actions 
in 
general 
and 
free 
action 
in 
particular 
are 
not 
on 
that 
account 
necessary 
with 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
which 
would 
be 
truly 
incompatible 
with 
contingency. 
Thus 
neither 
futurition 
in 
itself, 
certain 
as 
it 
is, 
nor 
the 
infallible 
prevision 
of 
God, 
nor 
the 
predetermination 
either 
of 
causes 
or 
of 
God’s 
decrees 
destroys 
this 
contingency 
and 
this 
freedom. 
That 
is 
acknowledged 
inrespectoffuturition 
andprevision,ashasalreadybeenset 
forth. 
Since, 
moreover, 
God’s 
decree 
consists 
solely 
in 
the 
resolution 
he 
forms, 
after 
having 
compared 
all 
possible 
worlds, 
to 
choose 
that 
one 
which 
is 
the 
best, 
and 
bring 
it 
into 
existence 
together 
with 
all 
that 
this 
world 
contains, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
all-powerful 
word 
Fiat, 
it 
is 
plain 
to 
see 
that 
this 
decree 
changes 
nothing 
in 
the 
constitution 
of 
things: 
God 
leaves 
them 
just 
as 
they 
were 
in 
the 
state 
of 
mere 
possibility, 
that 
is, 
changing 
nothing 
either 
in 
their 
essence 
or 
nature, 
or 
even 
in 
their 
accidents, 
which 
are 
represented 
perfectly 
already 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
possible 
world. 
Thus 
that 
which 
is 
contingent 
and 
freeremainsnolesssounderthedecreesofGodthanunderhisprevision. 

53. 
But 
could 
God 
himself 
(it 
will 
be 
said) 
then 
change 
nothing 
in 
the 
world? 
Assuredly 
he 
could 
not 
now 
change 
it, 
without 
derogation 
to 
his 
wisdom, 
since 
he 
has 
foreseen 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
world 
and 
of 
what 
it 
contains, 
and 
since, 
likewise, 
he 
has 
formed 
this 
resolution 
to 
bring 
it 
into 
existence: 
for 
he 
cannot 
be 
mistaken 
nor 
repent, 
and 
it 
did 
not 
behove 
him 
to 
from 
an 
imperfect 
resolution 
applying 
to 
one 
part 
and 
not 
the 
whole. 
Thus, 
all 
being 
ordered 
from 
the 
beginning, 
it 
is 
only 
because 
of 
this 
hypothetical 
necessity, 
recognized 
by 
everyone, 
that 
after 
God’s 
prevision 
or 
after 
his 
resolution 
nothing 
can 
be 
changed: 
and 
yet 
the 
events 
in 
themselves 
remain 
contingent. 
For 
(setting 
aside 
this 
supposition 
of 
the 
futurition 
of 
the 
thing 
and 
of 
the 
prevision 
or 
of 
the 
resolution 
of 
God, 
a 
supposition 
which 
already 
lays 
it 
down 
as 
a 
fact 
that 
the 
thing 
will 
happen, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
one 
must 
say, 
‘Unumquodque, 
quando 
est, 
oportet 
esse, 
aut 
unumquodque, 
siquidem 
erit, 
oportet 
futurum 
esse’), 
the 
event 
has 
nothing 
in 
it 
to 
render 
it 
necessary 
and 
to 
suggest 
that 
no 
other 
thing 
might 
have 
happened 
in 
its 
stead. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
connexion 
between 
causes 
and 
effects, 
it 
only 
inclined, 
without 
necessitating, 
the 
free 
agency, 
as 
I 
have 
just 
explained; 
thus 
it 
does 
not 
produce 
even 
a 
hypothetical 
necessity, 
save 
in 
conjunction 
with 
something 
from 
outside, 
to 
wit, 
this 
very 
maxim, 
that 
the 
prevailing 
inclination 
always 
triumphs. 
54. 
It 
will 
be 
said 
also 
that, 
if 
all 
is 
ordered, 
God 
cannot 
then 
perform 
miracles. 
But 
one 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
miracles 
which 
happen 
in 
the 
world 
were 
also 
enfolded 
and 
represented 
as 
possible 
in 
this 
same 
world 
considered 
in 
thestate 
of 
merepossibility;and 
God, 
who 
hassince 
performed 
them, 
when 
he 
chose 
this 
world 
had 
even 
then 
decreed 
to 
perform 
them. 
Again 
the 
objection 
will 
be 
made 
that 
vows 
and 
prayers, 
merits 
and 
demerits, 
good 
and 
bad 
actions 
avail 
nothing, 
since 
nothing 
can 
be 
changed. 
This 
objection 
causes 
most 
perplexity 
to 
people 
in 
general, 
and 
yet 
it 
is 
purely 
a 

sophism. 
These 
prayers, 
these 
vows, 
these 
good 
or 
bad 
actions 
that 
occur 
today 
were 
already 
before 
God 
when 
he 
formed 
the 
resolution 
to 
order 
things. 
Those 
things 
which 
happen 
in 
this 
existing 
world 
were 
represented, 
with 
their 
effects 
and 
their 
consequences, 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
same 
world, 
while 
it 
was 
still 
possible 
only; 
they 
were 
represented 
therein, 
attracting 
God’s 
grace 
whether 
natural 
or 
supernatural, 
requiring 
punishments 
or 
rewards, 
just 
as 
it 
has 
happened 
actually 
in 
this 
world 
since 
God 
chose 
it. 
The 
prayer 
or 
the 
good 
action 
were 
even 
then 
an 
ideal 
cause 
or 
condition, 
that 
is, 
an 
inclining 
reason 
able 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
grace 
of 
God, 
or 
to 
the 
reward, 
as 
it 
now 
does 
in 
reality. 
Since, 
moreover, 
all 
is 
wisely 
connected 
together 
in 
the 
world, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
God, 
foreseeing 
that 
which 
would 
happen 
freely, 
ordered 
all 
other 
things 
on 
that 
basis 
beforehand, 
or 
(what 
is 
the 
same) 
he 
chose 
that 
possible 
worldinwhicheverythingwasorderedinthisfashion. 


55. 
This 
consideration 
demolishes 
at 
the 
same 
time 
what 
the 
ancients 
called 
the 
‘Lazy 
Sophism’ 
(λογος 
αργος) 
which 
ended 
in 
a 
decision 
to 
do 
nothing: 
for 
(people 
would 
say) 
if 
what 
I 
ask 
is 
to 
happen 
it 
will 
happen 
even 
though 
I 
should 
do 
nothing; 
and 
if 
it 
is 
not 
to 
happen 
it 
will 
never 
happen, 
no 
matter 
what 
trouble 
I 
take 
to 
achieve 
it. 
This 
necessity, 
supposedly 
existent 
in 
events, 
and 
detached 
from 
their 
causes, 
might 
be 
termed 
Fatum 
Mahometanum, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
observed 
above, 
because 
a 
similar 
line 
of 
reasoning, 
so 
it 
is 
said, 
causes 
the 
Turks 
not 
to 
shun 
places 
ravaged 
by 
plague. 
But 
the 
answer 
is 
quite 
ready: 
the 
effect 
being 
certain, 
the 
cause 
that 
shall 
produce 
it 
is 
certain 
also; 
and 
if 
the 
effect 
comes 
about 
it 
will 
be 
by 
virtue 
of 
a 
proportionate 
cause. 
Thus 
your 
laziness 
perchance 
will 
bring 
it 
about 
that 
you 
will 
obtain 
naught 
of 
what 
you 
desire, 
and 
that 
you 
will 
fall 
into 
those 
misfortunes 
which 
you 
would 
by 
acting 
with 
care 
have 
avoided. 
We 
see, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
connexion 
of 
causes 
with 
effects, 
far 
from 
causing 
an 
unendurable 
fatality, 
provides 
rather 
a 
means 
of 
obviating 
it. 
There 
is 
a 

German 
proverb 
which 
says 
that 
death 
will 
ever 
have 
a 
cause; 
and 
nothing 
is 
so 
true. 
You 
will 
die 
on 
that 
day 
(let 
us 
presume 
it 
is 
so, 
and 
that 
God 
foresees 
it): 
yes, 
without 
doubt; 
but 
it 
will 
be 
because 
you 
will 
do 
what 
shall 
lead 
you 
thither. 
It 
is 
likewise 
with 
the 
chastisements 
of 
God, 
which 
also 
depend 
upon 
their 
causes. 
And 
it 
will 
be 
apposite 
in 
this 
connexion 
to 
quote 
this 
famous 
passage 
from 
St. 
Ambrose 
(in 
cap. 
I 
Lucae), 
‘Novit 
Dominus 
mutare 
sententiam, 
si 
tu 
noveris 
mutare 
delictum’, 
which 
is 
not 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
of 
reprobation, 
but 
of 
denunciation, 
such 
as 
that 
which 
Jonah 
dealt 
out 
for 
God 
to 
the 
Ninevites. 
This 
common 
saying: 
‘Si 
non 
es 
praedestinatus,facutpraedestineris’,must 
not 
betaken 
literally,its 
truesense 
being 
that 
he 
who 
has 
doubts 
of 
his 
predestination 
need 
only 
do 
what 
is 
required 
for 
him 
to 
obtain 
it 
by 
the 
grace 
of 
God. 
The 
sophism 
which 
ends 
in 
a 
decision 
to 
trouble 
oneself 
over 
nothing 
will 
haply 
be 
useful 
sometimes 
to 
induce 
certain 
people 
to 
face 
danger 
fearlessly. 
It 
has 
been 
applied 
in 
particular 
to 
Turkish 
soldiers: 
but 
it 
seems 
that 
hashish 
is 
a 
more 
important 
factor 
than 
this 
sophism, 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
resolute 
spirit 
in 
the 
Turks 
has 
greatly 
belieditselfin 
ourdays. 


56. 
A 
learned 
physician 
of 
Holland 
named 
Johan 
van 
Beverwyck 
took 
the 
trouble 
to 
write 
De 
Termino 
Vitae 
and 
to 
collect 
sundry 
answers, 
letters 
and 
discourses 
of 
some 
learned 
men 
of 
his 
time 
on 
this 
subject. 
This 
collection 
has 
been 
printed, 
and 
it 
is 
astonishing 
to 
see 
there 
how 
often 
people 
are 
misled, 
and 
how 
they 
have 
confused 
a 
problem 
which, 
properly 
speaking, 
is 
the 
easiest 
in 
the 
world. 
After 
that 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
that 
there 
are 
very 
many 
doubts 
which 
the 
human 
race 
cannot 
abandon. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
people 
love 
to 
lose 
themselves, 
and 
this 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
ramble 
of 
the 
mind, 
which 
is 
unwilling 
to 
subject 
itself 
to 
attention, 
to 
order, 
to 
rules. 
It 
seems 
as 
though 
we 
are 
so 
accustomed 
to 
games 
and 
jesting 
that 
we 
play 
the 
fool 
even 
in 
the 
most 
seriousoccupations,

57. 
I 
fear 
that 
in 
the 
recent 
dispute 
between 
the 
theologians 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession, 
De 
Termino 
Paenitentiae 
Peremptorio, 
which 
has 
called 
forth 
so 
many 
treatises 
in 
Germany, 
some 
misunderstanding, 
though 
of 
a 
different 
nature, 
has 
slipped 
in. 
The 
terms 
prescribed 
by 
the 
laws 
are 
amongst 
lawyers 
known 
as 
fatalia. 
It 
may 
be 
said, 
in 
a 
sense, 
that 
the 
peremptory 
term, 
prescribed 
to 
man 
for 
his 
repentance 
and 
amendment, 
is 
certain 
in 
the 
sight 
of 
God, 
with 
whom 
all 
is 
certain. 
God 
knows 
when 
a 
sinner 
will 
be 
so 
hardened 
that 
thereafter 
nothing 
can 
be 
done 
for 
him: 
not 
indeed 
that 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
him 
to 
do 
penance 
or 
that 
sufficient 
grace 
needs 
must 
be 
refused 
to 
him 
after 
a 
certain 
term, 
a 
grace 
that 
never 
fails; 
but 
because 
there 
will 
be 
a 
time 
whereafter 
he 
will 
no 
more 
approach 
the 
ways 
of 
salvation. 
But 
we 
never 
have 
certain 
marks 
for 
recognizing 
this 
term, 
and 
we 
are 
never 
justified 
in 
considering 
a 
man 
utterly 
abandoned: 
that 
would 
be 
to 
pass 
a 
rash 
judgement. 
It 
were 
better 
always 
to 
have 
room 
for 
hope; 
and 
this 
is 
an 
occasion, 
with 
a 
thousand 
others, 
where 
our 
ignorance 
is 
beneficial. 
Prudens 
futuri 
temporis 
exitum 
Caliginosa 
nocte 
premit 
Deus. 


58. 
The 
whole 
future 
is 
doubtless 
determined: 
but 
since 
we 
know 
not 
what 
it 
is, 
nor 
what 
is 
foreseen 
or 
resolved, 
we 
must 
do 
our 
duty, 
according 
to 
the 
reason 
that 
God 
has 
given 
us 
and 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
that 
he 
has 
prescribed 
for 
us; 
and 
thereafter 
we 
must 
have 
a 
quiet 
mind, 
and 
leave 
to 
God 
himself 
the 
care 
for 
the 
outcome. 
For 
he 
will 
never 
fail 
to 
do 
that 
which 
shall 
be 
the 
best, 
not 
only 
in 
general 
but 
also 
in 
particular, 
for 
those 
who 
have 
true 
confidence 
in 
him, 
that 
is, 
a 
confidence 
composed 
of 
true 
piety, 
a 
lively 
faith 
and 
fervent 
charity, 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
we 
will, 
as 
far 
as 
in 
us 
lies, 
neglect 
nothing 
appertaining 
to 
our 
duty 
and 
his 
service. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
cannot 
‘render 
service’ 
to 
him, 
for 
he 
has 
need 
of 
nothing: 
but 
it 
is 
‘serving 
him’, 
in 

our 
parlance, 
when 
we 
strive 
to 
carry 
out 
his 
presumptive 
will, 
co-operating 
in 
the 
good 
as 
it 
is 
known 
to 
us, 
wherever 
we 
can 
contribute 
thereto. 
For 
we 
must 
always 
presume 
that 
God 
is 
prompted 
towards 
the 
good 
we 
know, 
until 
the 
event 
shows 
us 
that 
he 
had 
stronger 
reasons, 
although 
perhaps 
unknown 
to 
us, 
which 
have 
made 
him 
subordinate 
this 
good 
that 
we 
sought 
to 
some 
other 
greater 
good 
of 
his 
own 
designing, 
which 
he 
has 
not 
failed 
or 
will 
not 
fail 
toeffect. 


59. 
I 
have 
just 
shown 
how 
the 
action 
of 
the 
will 
depends 
upon 
its 
causes; 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
so 
appropriate 
to 
human 
nature 
as 
this 
dependence 
of 
our 
actions; 
and 
that 
otherwise 
one 
would 
slip 
into 
a 
preposterous 
and 
unendurable 
fatality, 
namely 
into 
the 
Fatum 
Mahometanum, 
which 
is 
the 
worst 
of 
all 
because 
it 
overthrows 
foresight 
and 
good 
counsel. 
It 
is 
well 
to 
show, 
notwithstanding, 
how 
this 
dependence 
of 
voluntary 
actions 
does 
not 
fundamentally 
preclude 
the 
existence 
within 
us 
of 
a 
wonderful 
spontaneity, 
which 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
makes 
the 
soul 
in 
its 
resolves 
independent 
of 
the 
physical 
influence 
of 
all 
other 
creatures. 
This 
spontaneity, 
hitherto 
little 
recognized, 
which 
exalts 
our 
command 
over 
our 
actions 
to 
the 
highest 
pitch, 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
System 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
of 
which 
I 
must 
give 
some 
explanation 
here. 
The 
Scholastic 
philosophers 
believed 
that 
there 
was 
a 
reciprocal 
physical 
influence 
between 
body 
and 
soul: 
but 
since 
it 
has 
been 
recognized 
that 
thought 
and 
dimensional 
mass 
have 
no 
mutual 
connexion, 
and 
that 
they 
are 
creatures 
differing 
toto 
genere, 
many 
moderns 
have 
acknowledged 
that 
there 
is 
no 
physical 
communication 
between 
soul 
and 
body, 
despite 
the 
metaphysical 
communication 
always 
subsisting, 
which 
causes 
soul 
and 
body 
to 
compose 
one 
and 
the 
same 
suppositum, 
or 
what 
is 
called 
a 
person. 
This 
physical 
communication, 
if 
there 
were 
such, 
would 
cause 
the 
soul 
to 
change 
the 
degree 
of 
speed 
and 
the 
directional 
line 
of 
some 
motions 
that 
are 
in 
the 
body, 
and 
vice 
versa 
the 
body 
to 
change 
the 
sequence 

of 
the 
thoughts 
that 
are 
in 
the 
soul. 
But 
this 
effect 
cannot 
be 
inferred 
from 
any 
notion 
conceived 
in 
the 
body 
and 
in 
the 
soul; 
though 
nothing 
be 
better 
known 
to 
us 
than 
the 
soul, 
since 
it 
is 
inmost 
to 
us, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
inmost 
to 
itself. 


60. 
M. 
Descartes 
wished 
to 
compromise 
and 
to 
make 
a 
part 
of 
the 
body’s 
action 
dependent 
upon 
the 
soul. 
He 
believed 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
rule 
of 
Nature 
to 
the 
effect, 
according 
to 
him, 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
movement 
is 
conserved 
in 
bodies. 
He 
deemed 
it 
not 
possible 
that 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
soul 
should 
violate 
this 
law 
of 
bodies, 
but 
he 
believed 
that 
the 
soul 
notwithstanding 
might 
have 
power 
to 
change 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
movements 
that 
are 
made 
in 
the 
body; 
much 
as 
a 
rider, 
though 
giving 
no 
force 
to 
the 
horse 
he 
mounts, 
nevertheless 
controls 
it 
by 
guiding 
that 
force 
in 
any 
direction 
he 
pleases. 
But 
as 
that 
is 
done 
by 
means 
of 
the 
bridle, 
the 
bit, 
the 
spurs 
and 
other 
material 
aids, 
it 
is 
conceivable 
how 
that 
can 
be; 
there 
are, 
however, 
no 
instruments 
such 
as 
the 
soul 
may 
employ 
for 
this 
result, 
nothing 
indeed 
either 
in 
the 
soul 
or 
in 
the 
body, 
that 
is, 
either 
in 
thought 
or 
in 
the 
mass, 
which 
may 
serve 
to 
explain 
this 
change 
of 
the 
one 
by 
the 
other. 
In 
a 
word, 
that 
the 
soul 
should 
change 
the 
quantity 
of 
force 
and 
that 
it 
should 
changetheline 
ofdirection,boththesethings 
areequallyinexplicable. 
61. 
Moreover, 
two 
important 
truths 
on 
this 
subject 
have 
been 
discovered 
since 
M. 
Descartes’ 
day. 
The 
first 
is 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
absolute 
force 
which 
is 
in 
fact 
conserved 
is 
different 
from 
the 
quantity 
of 
movement, 
as 
I 
have 
demonstrated 
elsewhere. 
The 
second 
discovery 
is 
that 
the 
same 
direction 
is 
still 
conserved 
in 
all 
bodies 
together 
that 
are 
assumed 
as 
interacting, 
in 
whatever 
way 
they 
come 
into 
collision. 
If 
this 
rule 
had 
been 
known 
to 
M. 
Descartes, 
he 
would 
have 
taken 
the 
direction 
of 
bodies 
to 
be 
as 
independent 
of 
the 
soul 
as 
their 
force; 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
that 
would 
have 
led 
direct 
to 
the 

Hypothesis 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
whither 
these 
same 
rules 
have 
led 
me. 
For 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
physical 
influence 
of 
one 
of 
these 
substances 
on 
the 
other 
is 
inexplicable, 
I 
recognized 
that 
without 
a 
complete 
derangement 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
Nature 
the 
soul 
could 
not 
act 
physically 
upon 
the 
body. 
And 
I 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
one 
could 
here 
listen 
to 
philosophers, 
competent 
in 
other 
respects, 
who 
produce 
a 
God, 
as 
it 
were, 
ex 
machina, 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
final 
solution 
of 
the 
piece, 
maintaining 
that 
God 
exerts 
himself 
deliberately 
to 
move 
bodies 
as 
the 
soul 
pleases, 
and 
to 
give 
perceptions 
to 
the 
soul 
as 
the 
body 
requires. 
For 
this 
system, 
which 
is 
called 
that 
of 
occasional 
causes 
(because 
it 
teaches 
that 
God 
acts 
on 
the 
body 
at 
the 
instance 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
vice 
versa), 
besides 
introducing 
perpetual 
miracles 
to 
establish 
communication 
between 
these 
two 
substances, 
does 
not 
obviate 
the 
derangement 
of 
the 
natural 
laws 
obtaining 
in 
each 
of 
these 
same 
substances, 
which, 
in 
the 
general 
opinion, 
their 
mutual 
influence 
would 
cause. 


62. 
Being 
on 
other 
considerations 
already 
convinced 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
Harmony 
in 
general, 
I 
was 
in 
consequence 
convinced 
likewise 
of 
the 
preformation 
and 
the 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
of 
all 
things 
amongst 
themselves, 
of 
that 
between 
nature 
and 
grace, 
between 
the 
decrees 
of 
God 
and 
our 
actions 
foreseen, 
between 
all 
parts 
of 
matter, 
and 
even 
between 
the 
future 
and 
the 
past, 
the 
whole 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
sovereign 
wisdom 
of 
God, 
whose 
works 
are 
the 
most 
harmonious 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
conceive. 
Thus 
I 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
arrive 
at 
the 
system 
which 
declares 
that 
God 
created 
the 
soul 
in 
the 
beginning 
in 
such 
a 
fashion 
that 
it 
must 
produce 
and 
represent 
to 
itself 
successively 
that 
which 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
body, 
and 
the 
body 
also 
in 
such 
a 
fashion 
that 
it 
must 
do 
of 
itself 
that 
which 
the 
soul 
ordains. 
Consequently 
the 
laws 
that 
connect 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
soul 
in 
the 
order 
of 
final 
causes 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
evolution 
of 
perceptions 
must 

produce 
pictures 
that 
meet 
and 
harmonize 
with 
the 
impressions 
of 
bodies 
on 
our 
organs; 
and 
likewise 
the 
laws 
of 
movements 
in 
the 
body, 
which 
follow 
one 
another 
in 
the 
order 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
meet 
and 
so 
harmonize 
with 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
soul 
that 
the 
body 
is 
induced 
to 
act 
at 
the 
time 
when 
the 
soul 
willsit. 


63. 
Far 
from 
its 
being 
prejudicial, 
nothing 
can 
be 
more 
favourable 
to 
freedom 
than 
that 
system. 
And 
M. 
Jacquelot 
has 
demonstrated 
well 
in 
his 
book 
on 
the 
Conformity 
of 
Faith 
with 
Reason, 
that 
it 
is 
just 
as 
if 
he 
who 
knows 
all 
that 
I 
shall 
order 
a 
servant 
to 
do 
the 
whole 
day 
long 
on 
the 
morrow 
made 
an 
automaton 
entirely 
resembling 
this 
servant, 
to 
carry 
out 
to-morrow 
at 
the 
right 
moment 
all 
that 
I 
should 
order; 
and 
yet 
that 
would 
not 
prevent 
me 
from 
ordering 
freely 
all 
that 
I 
should 
please, 
although 
the 
action 
of 
the 
automaton 
thatwouldserveme 
wouldnotbeintheleastfree. 
64. 
Moreover, 
since 
all 
that 
passes 
in 
the 
soul 
depends, 
according 
to 
this 
system, 
only 
upon 
the 
soul, 
and 
its 
subsequent 
state 
is 
derived 
only 
from 
it 
and 
from 
its 
present 
state, 
how 
can 
one 
give 
it 
a 
greater 
independence? 
It 
is 
true 
that 
there 
still 
remains 
some 
imperfection 
in 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
soul. 
All 
that 
happens 
to 
the 
soul 
depends 
upon 
it, 
but 
depends 
not 
always 
upon 
its 
will; 
that 
were 
too 
much. 
Nor 
are 
such 
happenings 
even 
recognized 
always 
by 
its 
understanding 
or 
perceived 
with 
distinctness. 
For 
there 
is 
in 
the 
soul 
not 
only 
an 
order 
of 
distinct 
perceptions, 
forming 
its 
dominion, 
but 
also 
a 
series 
of 
confused 
perceptions 
or 
passions, 
forming 
its 
bondage: 
and 
there 
is 
no 
need 
for 
astonishment 
at 
that; 
the 
soul 
would 
be 
a 
Divinity 
if 
it 
had 
none 
but 
distinct 
perceptions. 
It 
has 
nevertheless 
some 
power 
over 
these 
confused 
perceptions 
also, 
even 
if 
in 
an 
indirect 
manner. 
For 
although 
it 
cannot 
change 
its 
passions 
forthwith, 
it 
can 
work 
from 
afar 
towards 
that 
end 
with 
enough 
success, 
and 
endue 
itselfwith 
new 
passionsandeven 
habits. 
Iteven 
hasa 
like 
power 
over 
the 
more 
distinct 
perceptions, 
being 
able 
to 
endue 
itself 
indirectly 

with 
opinions 
and 
intentions, 
and 
to 
hinder 
itself 
from 
having 
this 
one 
or 
that, 
and 
stay 
or 
hasten 
its 
judgement. 
For 
we 
can 
seek 
means 
beforehand 
to 
arrest 
ourselves, 
when 
occasion 
arises, 
on 
the 
sliding 
step 
of 
a 
rash 
judgement; 
we 
can 
find 
some 
incident 
to 
justify 
postponement 
of 
our 
resolution 
even 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
matter 
appears 
ready 
to 
be 
judged. 
Although 
our 
opinion 
and 
our 
act 
of 
willing 
be 
not 
directly 
objects 
of 
our 
will 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
observed), 
one 
sometimes, 
takes 
measures 
nevertheless, 
to 
will 
and 
even 
to 
believe 
in 
due 
time, 
that 
which 
one 
does 
not 
will, 
or 
believe, 
now. 
So 
great 
is 
theprofundity 
ofthespiritofman. 


65. 
And 
now, 
to 
bring 
to 
a 
conclusion 
this 
question 
of 
spontaneity, 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that, 
on 
a 
rigorous 
definition, 
the 
soul 
has 
within 
it 
the 
principle 
of 
all 
its 
actions, 
and 
even 
of 
all 
its 
passions, 
and 
that 
the 
same 
is 
true 
in 
all 
the 
simple 
substances 
scattered 
throughout 
Nature, 
although 
there 
be 
freedom 
only 
in 
those 
that 
are 
intelligent. 
In 
the 
popular 
sense 
notwithstanding, 
speaking 
in 
accordance 
with 
appearances, 
we 
must 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
depends 
in 
some 
way 
upon 
the 
body 
and 
upon 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
senses: 
much 
as 
we 
speak 
with 
Ptolemy 
and 
Tycho 
in 
everyday 
converse, 
and 
think 
with 
Copernicus, 
when 
itis 
aquestionoftherisingandthesettingof 
thesun. 
66. 
One 
may 
however 
give 
a 
true 
and 
philosophic 
sense 
to 
this 
mutual 
dependence 
which 
we 
suppose 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body. 
It 
is 
that 
the 
one 
of 
these 
two 
substances 
depends 
upon 
the 
other 
ideally, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
reason 
of 
that 
which 
is 
done 
in 
the 
one 
can 
be 
furnished 
by 
that 
which 
is 
in 
the 
other. 
This 
had 
already 
happened 
when 
God 
ordered 
beforehand 
the 
harmony 
that 
there 
would 
be 
between 
them. 
Even 
so 
would 
that 
automaton, 
that 
should 
fulfil 
the 
servant’s 
function, 
depend 
upon 
me 
ideally, 
in 
virtue 
of 
theknowledgeofhimwho,foreseeingmy 
futureorders,wouldhaverendered 
it 
capable 
of 
serving 
me 
at 
the 
right 
moment 
all 
through 
the 
morrow. 
The 
knowledge 
of 
my 
future 
intentions 
would 
have 
actuated 
this 
great 
craftsman, 

who 
would 
accordingly 
have 
fashioned 
the 
automaton: 
my 
influence 
would 
be 
objective, 
and 
his 
physical. 
For 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
soul 
has 
perfection 
and 
distinct 
thoughts, 
God 
has 
accommodated 
the 
body 
to 
the 
soul, 
and 
has 
arranged 
beforehand 
that 
the 
body 
is 
impelled 
to 
execute 
its 
orders. 
And 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
soul 
is 
imperfect 
and 
as 
its 
perceptions 
are 
confused, 
God 
has 
accommodated 
the 
soul 
to 
the 
body, 
in 
such 
sort 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
swayed 
by 
the 
passions 
arising 
out 
of 
corporeal 
representations. 
This 
produces 
the 
same 
effect 
and 
the 
same 
appearance 
as 
if 
the 
one 
depended 
immediately 
upon 
the 
other, 
and 
by 
the 
agency 
of 
a 
physical 
influence. 
Properly 
speaking, 
it 
is 
by 
its 
confused 
thoughts 
that 
the 
soul 
represents 
the 
bodies 
which 
encompass 
it. 
The 
same 
thing 
must 
apply 
to 
all 
that 
we 
understand 
by 
the 
actions 
of 
simple 
substances 
one 
upon 
another. 
For 
each 
one 
is 
assumed 
to 
act 
upon 
the 
other 
in 
proportion 
to 
its 
perfection, 
although 
this 
be 
only 
ideally, 
and 
in 
the 
reasons 
of 
things, 
as 
God 
in 
the 
beginning 
ordered 
one 
substance 
to 
accord 
with 
another 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
perfection 
or 
imperfection 
that 
there 
is 
in 
each. 
(Withal 
action 
and 
passion 
are 
always 
reciprocal 
in 
creatures, 
because 
one 
part 
of 
the 
reasons 
which 
serve 
to 
explain 
clearly 
what 
is 
done, 
and 
which 
have 
served 
to 
bring 
it 
into 
existence, 
is 
in 
the 
one 
of 
these 
substances, 
and 
another 
part 
of 
these 
reasons 
is 
in 
the 
other, 
perfections 
and 
imperfections 
being 
always 
mingled 
and 
shared.) 
Thus 
it 
is 
we 
attribute 
action 
totheone,and 
passion 
totheother. 


67. 
But 
after 
all, 
whatsoever 
dependence 
be 
conceived 
in 
voluntary 
actions, 
and 
even 
though 
there 
were 
an 
absolute 
and 
mathematical 
necessity 
(which 
there 
is 
not) 
it 
would 
not 
follow 
that 
there 
would 
not 
be 
a 
sufficient 
degree 
of 
freedom 
to 
render 
rewards 
and 
punishments 
just 
and 
reasonable. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
generally 
we 
speak 
as 
though 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
action 
put 
an 
end 
to 
all 
merit 
and 
all 
demerit, 
all 
justification 
for 
praise 
and 
blame, 
for 
reward 
and 
punishment: 
but 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
this 
conclusion 
is 
not 

entirely 
correct. 
I 
am 
very 
far 
from 
sharing 
the 
opinions 
of 
Bradwardine, 
Wyclif, 
Hobbes 
and 
Spinoza, 
who 
advocate, 
so 
it 
seems, 
this 
entirely 
mathematical 
necessity, 
which 
I 
think 
I 
have 
adequately 
refuted, 
and 
perhaps 
more 
clearly 
than 
is 
customary. 
Yet 
one 
must 
always 
bear 
testimony 
to 
the 
truth 
and 
not 
impute 
to 
a 
dogma 
anything 
that 
does 
not 
result 
from 
it. 
Moreover, 
these 
arguments 
prove 
too 
much, 
since 
they 
would 
prove 
just 
as 
much 
against 
hypothetical 
necessity, 
and 
would 
justify 
the 
lazy 
sophism. 
For 
the 
absolute 
necessity 
of 
the 
sequence 
of 
causes 
would 
in 
this 
matter 
add 
nothingto 
theinfallible 
certaintyofahypotheticalnecessity. 


68. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
therefore, 
it 
must 
be 
agreed 
that 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
kill 
a 
madman 
when 
one 
cannot 
by 
other 
means 
defend 
oneself. 
It 
will 
be 
granted 
also 
that 
it 
is 
permitted, 
and 
often 
even 
necessary, 
to 
destroy 
venomous 
or 
verynoxiousanimals,althoughtheybe 
not 
sobytheirownfault. 
69. 
Secondly, 
one 
inflicts 
punishments 
upon 
a 
beast, 
despite 
its 
lack 
of 
reason 
and 
freedom, 
when 
one 
deems 
that 
this 
may 
serve 
to 
correct 
it: 
thus 
one 
punishes 
dogs 
and 
horses, 
and 
indeed 
with 
much 
success. 
Rewards 
serve 
us 
no 
less 
in 
the 
managing 
of 
animals: 
when 
an 
animal 
is 
hungry, 
the 
food 
that 
is 
given 
to 
him 
causes 
him 
to 
do 
what 
otherwise 
would 
never 
be 
obtained 
fromhim. 
70. 
Thirdly, 
onewouldinflict 
evenonbeasts 
capitalpunishments(whereit 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
question 
of 
correcting 
the 
beast 
that 
is 
punished) 
if 
this 
punishment 
could 
serve 
as 
an 
example, 
or 
inspire 
terror 
in 
others, 
to 
make 
them 
cease 
from 
evil 
doing. 
Rorarius, 
in 
his 
book 
on 
reason 
in 
beasts, 
says 
that 
in 
Africa 
they 
crucified 
lions, 
in 
order 
to 
drive 
away 
other 
lions 
from 
the 
towns 
and 
frequented 
places, 
and 
that 
he 
had 
observed 
in 
passing 
through 
the 
province 
of 
Jülich 
that 
they 
hanged 
wolves 
there 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
greater 
safety 
for 
the 
sheepfolds. 
There 
are 
people 
in 
the 
villages 
also 
who 
nail 
birds 
of 
prey 
to 
the 
doors 
of 
houses, 
with 
the 
idea 
that 
other 
birds 
of 
the 
same 
kind 

will 
then 
not 
so 
readily 
appear. 
These 
measures 
would 
always 
be 
justified 
if 
theywereofanyavail. 


71. 
Then, 
in 
the 
fourth 
place, 
since 
experience 
proves 
that 
the 
fear 
of 
chastisements 
and 
the 
hope 
of 
rewards 
serves 
to 
make 
men 
abstain 
from 
evil 
and 
strive 
to 
do 
good, 
one 
would 
have 
good 
reason 
to 
avail 
oneself 
of 
such, 
even 
though 
men 
were 
acting 
under 
necessity, 
whatever 
the 
necessity 
might 
be. 
Theobjectionwill 
beraisedthatif 
goodorevilisnecessaryitisuseless 
to 
avail 
oneself 
of 
means 
to 
obtain 
it 
or 
to 
hinder 
it: 
but 
the 
answer 
has 
already 
been 
given 
above 
in 
the 
passage 
combating 
the 
lazy 
sophism. 
If 
good 
or 
evil 
were 
a 
necessity 
without 
these 
means, 
then 
such 
means 
would 
be 
unavailing; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
so. 
These 
goods 
and 
evils 
come 
only 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
these 
means, 
and 
if 
these 
results 
were 
necessary 
the 
means 
would 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
causes 
rendering 
them 
necessary, 
since 
experience 
teaches 
us 
that 
often 
fear 
or 
hope 
hinders 
evil 
or 
advances 
good. 
This 
objection, 
then, 
differs 
hardly 
at 
all 
from 
the 
lazy 
sophism, 
which 
we 
raise 
against 
the 
certainty 
as 
well 
as 
the 
necessity 
of 
future 
events. 
Thus 
one 
may 
say 
that 
these 
objections 
are 
directed 
equally 
against 
hypothetical 
necessity 
and 
absolute 
necessity, 
and 
that 
they 
prove 
as 
muchagainsttheone 
asagainsttheother,thatistosay,nothingatall. 
72. 
There 
was 
a 
great 
dispute 
between 
Bishop 
Bramhall 
and 
Mr. 
Hobbes, 
which 
began 
when 
they 
were 
both 
in 
Paris, 
and 
which 
was 
continued 
after 
their 
return 
to 
England; 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
it 
are 
to 
be 
found 
collected 
in 
a 
quarto 
volume 
published 
in 
London 
in 
the 
year 
1656. 
They 
are 
all 
in 
English, 
and 
have 
not 
been 
translated 
as 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
nor 
inserted 
in 
the 
Collection 
of 
Works 
in 
Latin 
by 
Mr. 
Hobbes. 
I 
had 
already 
read 
these 
writings, 
and 
have 
obtained 
them 
again 
since. 
And 
I 
had 
observed 
at 
the 
outset 
that 
he 
had 
not 
at 
all 
proved 
the 
absolute 
necessity 
of 
all 
things, 
but 
had 
shown 
sufficiently 
that 
necessity 
would 
not 
overthrow 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
divine 
or 
human 
justice, 
and 
would 
not 
prevent 
altogethertheexercise 
ofthisvirtue. 

73. 
Thereis,however, 
akindofjusticeandacertainsort 
ofrewards 
andof 
punishments 
which 
appear 
not 
so 
applicable 
to 
those 
who 
should 
act 
by 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
supposing 
such 
necessity 
existed. 
It 
is 
that 
kind 
of 
justice 
which 
has 
for 
its 
goal 
neither 
improvement 
nor 
example, 
nor 
even 
redress 
of 
the 
evil. 
This 
justice 
has 
its 
foundation 
only 
in 
the 
fitness 
of 
things, 
which 
demands 
a 
certain 
satisfaction 
for 
the 
expiation 
of 
an 
evil 
action. 
The 
Socinians, 
Hobbes 
and 
some 
others 
do 
not 
admit 
this 
punitive 
justice, 
which 
properly 
speaking 
is 
avenging 
justice. 
God 
reserves 
it 
for 
himself 
in 
many 
cases; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
fail 
to 
grant 
it 
to 
those 
who 
are 
entitled 
to 
govern 
others, 
and 
he 
exercises 
it 
through 
their 
agency, 
provided 
that 
they 
act 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
reason 
and 
not 
of 
passion. 
The 
Socinians 
believe 
it 
to 
be 
withoutfoundation,butitalways 
hassomefoundationin 
thatfitness 
ofthings 
which 
gives 
satisfaction 
not 
only 
to 
the 
injured 
but 
also 
to 
the 
wise 
who 
see 
it; 
even 
as 
a 
beautiful 
piece 
of 
music, 
or 
again 
a 
good 
piece 
of 
architecture, 
satisfies 
cultivated 
minds. 
And 
the 
wise 
lawgiver 
having 
threatened, 
and 
having, 
so 
to 
speak, 
promised 
a 
chastisement, 
it 
befits 
his 
consistency 
not 
to 
leave 
the 
action 
completely 
unpunished, 
even 
though 
the 
punishment 
would 
no 
longer 
avail 
to 
correct 
anyone. 
But 
even 
though 
he 
should 
have 
promised 
nothing, 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
there 
is 
a 
fitness 
of 
things 
which 
could 
have 
prompted 
him 
to 
make 
this 
promise, 
since 
the 
wise 
man 
likewise 
promises 
only 
that 
which 
is 
fitting. 
And 
one 
may 
even 
say 
that 
there 
is 
here 
a 
certain 
compensation 
of 
the 
mind, 
which 
would 
be 
scandalized 
by 
disorder 
if 
the 
chastisement 
did 
not 
contribute 
towards 
restoring 
order. 
One 
can 
also 
consult 
what 
Grotius 
wrote 
against 
the 
Socinians, 
of 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
Jesus 
Christ, 
and 
the 
answerofCrelliusthereto. 
74. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
the 
pains 
of 
the 
damned 
continue, 
even 
when 
they 
no 
longer 
serve 
to 
turn 
them 
away 
from 
evil, 
and 
that 
likewise 
the 
rewards 
of 
the 
blessed 
continue, 
even 
when 
they 
no 
longer 
serve 
for 
strengthening 
them 
in 

good. 
One 
may 
say 
nevertheless 
that 
the 
damned 
ever 
bring 
upon 
themselves 
new 
pains 
through 
new 
sins, 
and 
that 
the 
blessed 
ever 
bring 
upon 
themselves 
new 
joys 
by 
new 
progress 
in 
goodness: 
for 
both 
are 
founded 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
fitness 
of 
things, 
which 
has 
seen 
to 
it 
that 
affairs 
were 
so 
ordered 
that 
the 
evil 
action 
must 
bring 
upon 
itself 
a 
chastisement. 
There 
is 
good 
reason 
to 
believe, 
following 
the 
parallelism 
of 
the 
two 
realms, 
that 
of 
final 
causes 
and 
that 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
that 
God 
has 
established 
in 
the 
universe 
a 
connexion 
between 
punishment 
or 
reward 
and 
bad 
or 
good 
action, 
in 
accordance 
wherewith 
the 
first 
should 
always 
be 
attracted 
by 
the 
second, 
and 
virtue 
and 
vice 
obtain 
their 
reward 
and 
their 
punishment 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
natural 
sequence 
of 
things, 
which 
contains 
still 
another 
kind 
of 
pre-established 
harmony 
than 
that 
which 
appears 
in 
the 
communication 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body. 
For, 
in 
a 
word, 
all 
that 
God 
does, 
as 
I 
have 
said 
already, 
is 
harmonious 
to 
perfection. 
Perhaps 
then 
this 
principle 
of 
the 
fitness 
of 
things 
would 
no 
longer 
apply 
to 
beings 
acting 
without 
true 
freedom 
or 
exemption 
from 
absolute 
necessity; 
and 
in 
that 
case 
corrective 
justice 
alone 
would 
be 
administered, 
and 
not 
punitive 
justice. 
That 
is 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
famous 
Conringius, 
in 
a 
dissertation 
he 
published 
on 
what 
is 
just. 
And 
indeed, 
the 
reasons 
Pomponazzi 
employed 
in 
his 
book 
on 
fate, 
to 
prove 
the 
usefulness 
of 
chastisements 
and 
rewards, 
even 
though 
all 
should 
come 
about 
in 
our 
actions 
by 
a 
fatal 
necessity, 
concern 
only 
amendment 
and 
not 
satisfaction, 
κολασιν 
ου 
τιμωριαν. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
only 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
outward 
appearances 
that 
one 
destroys 
animals 
accessary 
to 
certain 
crimes, 
as 
one 
razes 
the 
houses 
of 
rebels, 
that 
is, 
to 
inspire 
terror. 
Thus 
it 
is 
an 
act 
of 
corrective 
justice, 
wherein 
punitivejusticehasnopart 
atall. 


75. 
But 
we 
will 
not 
amuse 
ourselves 
now 
by 
discussing 
a 
question 
more 
curious 
than 
necessary, 
since 
we 
have 
shown 
sufficiently 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
necessity 
in 
voluntary 
actions. 
Nevertheless 
it 
was 
well 
to 
show 
that 

imperfect 
freedom 
alone, 
that 
is, 
freedom 
which 
is 
exempt 
only 
from 
constraint, 
would 
suffice 
as 
foundation 
for 
chastisements 
and 
rewards 
of 
the 
kind 
conducive 
to 
the 
avoidance 
of 
evil, 
and 
to 
amendment. 
One 
sees 
also 
from 
this 
that 
some 
persons 
of 
intelligence, 
who 
persuade 
themselves 
that 
everything 
is 
necessary, 
are 
wrong 
in 
saying 
that 
none 
must 
be 
praised 
or 
blamed, 
rewarded 
or 
punished. 
Apparently 
they 
say 
so 
only 
to 
exercise 
their 
wit: 
thepretext 
is 
that 
allbeing 
necessary 
nothing 
would 
beinour 
power. 
But 
this 
pretext 
is 
ill 
founded: 
necessary 
actions 
would 
be 
still 
in 
our 
power, 
at 
least 
in 
so 
far 
as 
we 
could 
perform 
them 
or 
omit 
them, 
when 
the 
hope 
or 
the 
fear 
of 
praise 
or 
blame, 
of 
pleasure 
or 
pain 
prompted 
our 
will 
thereto, 
whether 
they 
prompted 
it 
of 
necessity, 
or 
in 
prompting 
it 
they 
left 
spontaneity, 
contingency 
and 
freedom 
all 
alike 
unimpaired. 
Thus 
praise 
and 
blame, 
rewards 
and 
punishments 
would 
preserve 
always 
a 
large 
part 
of 
their 
use,even 
though 
therewere 
a 
true 
necessity 
in 
our 
actions. 
We 
can 
praise 
and 
blame 
also 
natural 
good 
and 
bad 
qualities, 
where 
the 
will 
has 
no 
part 
— 
in 
a 
horse, 
in 
a 
diamond, 
in 
a 
man; 
and 
he 
who 
said 
of 
Cato 
of 
Utica 
that 
he 
acted 
virtuously 
through 
the 
goodness 
of 
his 
nature, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
for 
him 
tobehaveotherwise,thoughttopraisehimthemore. 


76. 
The 
difficulties 
which 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
up 
to 
now 
to 
remove 
have 
been 
almost 
all 
common 
to 
natural 
and 
revealed 
theology. 
Now 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
come 
to 
a 
question 
of 
revealed 
theology, 
concerning 
the 
election 
or 
the 
reprobation 
of 
men, 
with 
the 
dispensation 
or 
use 
of 
divine 
grace 
in 
connexion 
with 
these 
acts 
of 
the 
mercy 
or 
the 
justice 
of 
God. 
But 
when 
I 
answered 
the 
preceding 
objections, 
I 
opened 
up 
a 
way 
to 
meet 
those 
that 
remain. 
This 
confirms 
the 
observation 
I 
made 
thereon 
(Preliminary 
Dissertation, 
43) 
that 
there 
is 
rather 
a 
conflict 
between 
the 
true 
reasons 
of 
natural 
theology 
and 
the 
false 
reasons 
of 
human 
appearances, 
than 
between 
revealed 
faith 
and 
reason. 
For 
on 
this 
subject 
scarcely 
any 
difficulty 
arises 

that 
is 
new, 
and 
not 
deriving 
its 
origin 
from 
those 
which 
can

Now 
astheologiansofallpartiesaredividedamongthemselves 
onthis 
subject 
of 
predestination 
and 
grace, 
and 
often 
give 
different 
answers 
to 
the 
same 
objections, 
according 
to 
their 
various 
principles, 
one 
cannot 
avoid 
touching 
on 
the 
differences 
which 
prevail 
among 
them. 
One 
may 
say 
in 
general 
that 
some 
look 
upon 
God 
more 
metaphysically 
and 
others 
more 
morally: 
and 
it 
has 
already 
been 
stated 
on 
other 
occasions 
that 
the 
Counter-
Remonstrants 
took 
the 
first 
course 
and 
the 
Remonstrants 
the 
second. 
But 
to 
act 
rightly 
we 
must 
affirm 
alike 
on 
one 
side 
the 
independence 
of 
God 
and 
the 
dependence 
of 
creatures, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side 
the 
justice 
and 
goodness 
of 
God, 
which 
makes 
him 
dependent 
upon 
himself, 
his 
will 
upon 
his 
understandingor 
his 
wisdom.

Somegiftedand 
well-intentioned 
authors,desiringtoshowtheforceof 
the 
reasons 
advocated 
by 
the 
two 
principal 
parties, 
in 
order 
to 
persuade 
them 
to 
a 
mutual 
tolerance, 
deem 
that 
the 
whole 
controversy 
is 
reduced 
to 
this 
essential 
point, 
namely: 
What 
was 
God’s 
principal 
aim 
in 
making 
his 
decrees 
with 
regard 
to 
man? 
Did 
he 
make 
them 
solely 
in 
order 
to 
show 
forth 
his 
glory 
by 
manifesting 
his 
attributes, 
and 
forming, 
to 
that 
end, 
the 
great 
plan 
of 
creation 
and 
providence? 
Or 
has 
he 
had 
regard 
rather 
to 
the 
voluntary 
movements 
of 
intelligent 
substances 
which 
he 
designed 
to 
create, 
considering 
what 
they 
would 
will 
and 
do 
in 
the 
different 
circumstances 
and 
situations 
wherein 
he 
might 
place 
them, 
so 
as 
to 
form 
a 
fitting 
resolve 
thereupon? 
It 
appears 
to 
me 
that 
the 
two 
answers 
to 
this 
great 
question 
thus 
given 
as 
opposites 
to 
one 
another 
are 
easy 
to 
reconcile, 
and 
that 
in 
consequence 
the 
two 
parties 
would 
be 
agreed 
in 
principle, 
without 
any 
need 
of 
tolerance, 
if 
all 
were 
reduced 
to 
this 
point. 
In 
truth 
God, 
in 
designing 
to 
create 
the 
world, 
purposed 
solely 
to 
manifest 
and 
communicate 
his 
perfections 
in 
the 
way 
that 

was 
most 
efficacious, 
and 
most 
worthy 
of 
his 
greatness, 
his 
wisdom 
and 
his 
goodness. 
But 
that 
very 
purpose 
pledged 
him 
to 
consider 
all 
the 
actions 
of 
creatures 
while 
still 
in 
the 
state 
of 
pure 
possibility, 
that 
he 
might 
form 
the 
most 
fitting 
plan. 
He 
is 
like 
a 
great 
architect 
whose 
aim 
in 
view 
is 
the 
satisfaction 
or 
the 
glory 
of 
having 
built 
a 
beautiful 
palace, 
and 
who 
considers 
all 
that 
is 
to 
enter 
into 
this 
construction: 
the 
form 
and 
the 
materials, 
the 
place, 
the 
situation, 
the 
means, 
the 
workmen, 
the 
expense, 
before 
he 
forms 
a 
complete 
resolve. 
For 
a 
wise 
person 
in 
laying 
his 
plans 
cannot 
separate 
the 
end 
from 
the 
means; 
he 
does 
not 
contemplate 
any 
end 
without 
knowing 
if 
therearemeansof 
attainingthereto. 


79. 
Iknow 
notwhetherthere 
arealsoperchance 
persons 
who 
imaginethat, 
God 
being 
the 
absolute 
master 
of 
all 
things, 
one 
can 
thence 
infer 
that 
everything 
outside 
him 
is 
indifferent 
to 
him, 
that 
he 
considers 
himself 
alone, 
without 
concern 
for 
others, 
and 
that 
thus 
he 
has 
made 
some 
happy 
and 
others 
unhappy 
without 
any 
cause, 
without 
choice, 
without 
reason. 
But 
to 
teach 
so 
about 
God 
were 
to 
deprive 
him 
of 
wisdom 
and 
of 
goodness. 
We 
need 
only 
observe 
that 
he 
considers 
himself 
and 
neglects 
nothing 
of 
what 
he 
owes 
to 
himself, 
to 
conclude 
that 
he 
considers 
his 
creatures 
also, 
and 
that 
he 
uses 
theminthe 
manner 
most 
consistent 
with 
order. 
For 
the 
more 
a 
great 
andgood 
prince 
is 
mindful 
of 
his 
glory, 
the 
more 
he 
will 
think 
of 
making 
his 
subjects 
happy, 
even 
though 
he 
were 
the 
most 
absolute 
of 
all 
monarchs, 
and 
though 
his 
subjects 
were 
slaves 
from 
birth, 
bondsmen 
(in 
lawyers’ 
parlance), 
people 
entirely 
in 
subjection 
to 
arbitrary 
power. 
Calvin 
himself 
and 
some 
others 
of 
the 
greatest 
defenders 
of 
the 
absolute 
decree 
rightly 
maintained 
that 
God 
had 
great 
and 
just 
reasons 
for 
his 
election 
and 
the 
dispensation 
of 
his 
grace, 
although 
these 
reasons 
be 
unknown 
to 
us 
in 
detail: 
and 
we 
must 
judge 
charitably 
that 
the 
most 
rigid 
predestinators 
have 
too 
much 
reason 
and 
too 
muchpietytodepartfromthis 
opinion.

PART 
TWO 



107. 
HITHERTO 
I 
have 
devoted 
myself 
to 
giving 
a 
full 
and 
clear 
exposition 
of 
this 
whole 
subject: 
and 
although 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
spoken 
of 
M. 
Bayle’s 
objectionsinparticular,Ihaveendeavouredto 
anticipatethem, 
andtosuggest 
ways 
of 
answering 
them. 
But 
as 
I 
have 
taken 
upon 
myself 
the 
task 
of 
meeting 
them 
in 
detail, 
not 
only 
because 
there 
will 
perhaps 
still 
be 
passages 
calling 
for 
elucidation, 
but 
also 
because 
his 
arguments 
are 
usually 
full 
of 
wit 
and 
erudition, 
and 
serve 
to 
throw 
greater 
light 
on 
this 
controversy, 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
give 
an 
account 
of 
the 
chief 
objections 
that 
are 
dispersed 
through 
his 
works, 
and 
to 
add 
my 
answers. 
At 
the 
beginning 
I 
observed 
‘that 
God 
cooperates 
in 
moral 
evil, 
and 
in 
physical 
evil, 
and 
in 
each 
of 
them 
both 
morally 
and 
physically; 
and 
that 
man 
co-operates 
therein 
also 
morally 
and 
physically 
in 
a 
free 
and 
active 
way, 
becoming 
in 
consequence 
subject 
to 
blame 
and 
punishment’. 
I 
have 
shown 
also 
that 
each 
point 
has 
its 
own 
difficulty; 
but 
the 
greatest 
of 
these 
lies 
in 
maintaining 
that 
God 
co-operates 
morally 
in 
moral 
evil, 
that 
is, 
in 
sin, 
without 
being 
the 
originator 
of 
the 
sin, 
and 
even 
without 
beingaccessarythereto. 
108. 
Hedoesthisby 
permitting 
it 
justly,andby 
directing 
it 
wiselytowards 
the 
good, 
as 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
appears 
tolerably 
intelligible. 
But 
as 
it 
is 
here 
principally 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
undertakes 
to 
discomfit 
those 
who 
maintain 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
faith 
which 
cannot 
be 
harmonized 
with 
reason, 
it 
is 
also 
here 
especially 
I 
must 
show 
that 
my 
dogmas 
are 
fortified 
(to 
make 
use 
of 
his 
own 
allegory) 
with 
a 
rampart, 
even 
of 
reasons, 
which 
is 
able 
to 
resist 
the 
fire 
of 
his 
strongest 
batteries. 
He 
has 
ranged 
them 
against 
me 
in 
chapter144 
ofhis 
Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial 
(vol. 
III, 
), 
where 
he 
includes 
the 
theological 
doctrine 
in 
seven 
propositions 
and 
opposes 
thereto 

nineteen 
philosophic 
maxims, 
like 
so 
many 
large 
cannon 
capable 
of 
breachingmyrampart. 
Letusbegin 
withthetheologicalpropositions. 


109. 
I. 
‘God,’ 
he 
says, 
‘the 
Being 
eternal 
and 
necessary, 
infinitely 
good, 
holy, 
wise 
and 
powerful, 
possesses 
from 
all 
eternity 
a 
glory 
and 
a 
bliss 
that 
can 
never 
either 
increase 
or 
diminish.’ 
This 
proposition 
of 
M. 
Bayle’s 
is 
no 
less 
philosophical 
than 
theological. 
To 
say 
that 
God 
possesses 
a 
‘glory’ 
when 
he 
is 
alone, 
that 
depends 
upon 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
term. 
One 
may 
say, 
with 
some, 
that 
glory 
is 
the 
satisfaction 
one 
finds 
in 
being 
aware 
of 
one’s 
own 
perfections; 
and 
in 
this 
sense 
God 
possesses 
it 
always. 
But 
when 
glory 
signifies 
that 
others 
become 
aware 
of 
these 
perfections, 
onemaysay 
that 
God 
acquires 
it 
only 
when 
he 
reveals 
himself 
to 
intelligent 
creatures; 
even 
though 
it 
be 
true 
that 
God 
thereby 
gains 
no 
new 
good, 
and 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
rational 
creatures 
who 
thence 
derive 
advantage, 
when 
they 
apprehend 
aright 
the 
glory 
ofGod. 
110. 
II. 
‘He 
resolved 
freely 
upon 
the 
production 
of 
creatures, 
and 
he 
chose 
from 
among 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
possible 
beings 
those 
whom 
it 
pleased 
him 
to 
choose, 
to 
give 
them 
existence, 
and 
to 
compose 
the 
universe 
of 
them, 
while 
he 
left 
all 
the 
rest 
in 
nothingness.’ 
This 
proposition 
is 
also, 
just 
like 
the 
preceding 
one, 
in 
close 
conformity 
with 
that 
part 
of 
philosophy 
which 
is 
called 
natural 
theology. 
One 
must 
dwell 
a 
little 
on 
what 
is 
said 
here, 
that 
he 
chose 
the 
possible 
beings 
‘whom 
it 
pleased 
him 
to 
choose’. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
borneinmindthatwhenI 
say, 
‘thatpleasesme’,itisasthough 
I 
were 
saying, 
‘I 
find 
it 
good’. 
Thus 
it 
is 
the 
ideal 
goodness 
of 
the 
object 
which 
pleases, 
and 
which 
makes 
me 
choose 
it 
among 
many 
others 
which 
do 
not 
please 
or 
which 
please 
less, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
which 
contain 
less 
of 
that 
goodness 
which 
moves 
me. 
Now 
it 
is 
only 
the 
genuinely 
good 
that 
is 
capable 
of 
pleasing 
God: 
and 
consequently 
that 
whichpleases 
God 
most, 
and 
whichmeets 
his 
choice, 
is 
the 
best. 

111. 
III. 
‘Human 
nature 
having 
been 
among 
the 
Beings 
that 
he 
willed 
to 
produce, 
he 
created 
a 
man 
and 
a 
woman, 
and 
granted 
them 
amongst 
other 
favours 
free 
will, 
so 
that 
they 
had 
the 
power 
to 
obey 
him; 
but 
he 
threatened 
them 
with 
death 
if 
they 
should 
disobey 
the 
order 
that 
he 
gave 
them 
to 
abstain 
from 
a 
certain 
fruit.’ 
This 
proposition 
is 
in 
part 
revealed, 
and 
should 
be 
admitted 
without 
difficulty, 
provided 
that 
free 
will 
be 
understood 
properly, 
accordingtotheexplanationIhavegiven. 
112. 
IV. 
‘They 
ate 
thereof 
nevertheless, 
and 
thenceforth 
they 
were 
condemned, 
they 
and 
all 
their 
posterity, 
to 
the 
miseries 
of 
this 
life, 
to 
temporal 
death 
and 
eternal 
damnation, 
and 
made 
subject 
to 
such 
a 
tendency 
to 
sin 
that 
they 
abandoned 
themselves 
thereto 
endlessly 
and 
without 
ceasing.’ 
There 
is 
reason 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
forbidden 
action 
by 
itself 
entailed 
these 
evil 
results 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
natural 
effect, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
for 
that 
very 
reason, 
and 
not 
by 
a 
purely 
arbitrary 
decree, 
that 
God 
had 
forbidden 
it: 
much 
as 
one 
forbids 
knives 
to 
children. 
The 
famous 
Fludde 
or 
de 
Fluctibus, 
an 
Englishman, 
once 
wrote 
a 
book 
De 
Vita, 
Morte 
et 
Resurrectione 
under 
the 
name 
of 
R. 
Otreb, 
wherein 
he 
maintained 
that 
the 
fruit 
of 
the 
forbidden 
tree 
was 
a 
poison: 
but 
we 
cannot 
enter 
into 
this 
detail. 
It 
suffices 
that 
God 
forbade 
a 
harmful 
thing; 
one 
must 
not 
therefore 
suppose 
that 
God 
acted 
here 
simply 
in 
the 
character 
of 
a 
legislator 
who 
enacts 
a 
purely 
positive 
law, 
or 
of 
a 
judge 
who 
imposes 
and 
inflicts 
a 
punishment 
by 
an 
order 
of 
his 
will, 
without 
any 
connexion 
between 
the 
evil 
of 
guilt 
and 
the 
evil 
of 
punishment. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
that 
God 
in 
justifiable 
annoyance 
deliberately 
put 
a 
corruption 
in 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body 
of 
man, 
by 
an 
extraordinary 
action, 
in 
order 
to 
punish 
him: 
much 
as 
the 
Athenians 
gave 
hemlock-juice 
to 
their 
criminals. 
M. 
Bayle 
takes 
the 
matter 
thus: 
he 
speaks 
as 
if 
the 
original 
corruption 
had 
been 
put 
in 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
first 
man 
by 
an 
order 
and 
operation 

of 
God. 
It 
is 
that 
which 
calls 
forth 
his 
objection 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
III, 
ch. 
178, 
) 
‘that 
reason 
would 
not 
commend 
the 
monarch 
who, 
in 
order 
to 
chastise 
a 
rebel, 
condemned 
him 
and 
his 
descendants 
to 
have 
a 
tendency 
towards 
rebellion’. 
But 
this 
chastisement 
happens 
naturally 
to 
the 
wicked, 
without 
any 
ordinance 
of 
a 
legislator, 
and 
they 
become 
addicted 
to 
evil. 
If 
drunkards 
begot 
children 
inclined 
to 
the 
same 
vice, 
by 
a 
natural 
consequence 
of 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
bodies, 
that 
would 
be 
a 
punishment 
of 
their 
progenitors, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
penalty 
of 
law. 
There 
is 
something 
comparable 
to 
this 
in 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
first 
man’s 
sin. 
For 
the 
contemplation 
of 
divine 
wisdom 
leads 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
realm 
of 
nature 
serves 
that 
of 
grace; 
and 
that 
God 
as 
an 
Architect 
has 
done 
all 
in 
a 
manner 
befitting 
God 
considered 
as 
a 
Monarch. 
We 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
forbidden 
fruit, 
or 
that 
of 
the 
action, 
or 
its 
effects, 
to 
judge 
of 
the 
details 
of 
this 
matter: 
nevertheless 
we 
must 
do 
God 
justice 
so 
far 
as 
to 
believethat 
itcomprisedsomething

V. 
‘It 
has 
pleased 
him 
by 
his 
infinite 
mercy 
to 
deliver 
a 
very 
few 
men 
from 
this 
condemnation; 
and, 
leaving 
them 
exposed 
during 
this 
life 
to 
the 
corruption 
of 
sin 
and 
misery, 
he 
has 
given 
them 
aids 
which 
enable 
them 
to 
obtain 
the 
never-ending 
bliss 
of 
paradise.’ 
Many 
in 
the 
past 
have 
doubted, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
observed, 
whether 
the 
number 
of 
the 
damned 
is 
so 
great 
as 
is 
generally 
supposed; 
and 
it 
appears 
that 
they 
believed 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
some 
intermediate 
state 
between 
eternal 
damnation 
and 
perfect 
bliss. 
But 
we 
have 
no 
need 
of 
these 
opinions, 
and 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
keep 
to 
the 
ideas 
accepted 
in 
the 
Church. 
In 
this 
connexion 
it 
is 
well 
to 
observe 
that 
this 
proposition 
of 
M. 
Bayle’s 
is 
conceived 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
sufficient 
grace, 
given 
to 
all 
men, 
and 
sufficing 
them 
provided 
that 
they 
have 
good 
will. 
Although 
M. 
Bayle 
holds 
the 
opposite 
opinion, 
he 
wished 
(as 
he 
states 
in 
the 

margin) 
to 
avoid 
the 
terms 
that 
would 
not 
agree 
with 
a 
system 
of 
decrees 
subsequent 
totheprevisionof 
contingentevents. 


114. 
VI. 
‘He 
foresaw 
from 
eternity 
all 
that 
which 
should 
happen, 
he 
ordered 
all 
things 
and 
placed 
them 
each 
one 
in 
its 
own 
place, 
and 
he 
guides 
and 
controls 
them 
continually, 
according 
to 
his 
pleasure. 
Thus 
nothing 
is 
done 
without 
his 
permission 
or 
against 
his 
will, 
and 
he 
can 
prevent, 
as 
seems 
good 
to 
him, 
as 
much 
and 
as 
often 
as 
seems 
good 
to 
him, 
all 
that 
does 
not 
please 
him, 
and 
in 
consequence 
sin, 
which 
is 
the 
thing 
in 
the 
world 
that 
most 
offends 
him 
and 
that 
he 
most 
detests; 
and 
he 
can 
produce 
in 
each 
human 
soul 
all 
the 
thoughts 
that 
he 
approves.’ 
This 
thesis 
is 
also 
purely 
philosophic, 
that 
is, 
recognizable 
by 
the 
light 
of 
natural 
reason. 
It 
is 
opportune 
also, 
as 
one 
has 
dwelt 
in 
thesis 
II 
on 
that 
which 
pleases, 
to 
dwell 
here 
upon 
that 
which 
seems 
good, 
that 
is, 
upon 
that 
which 
God 
finds 
good 
to 
do. 
He 
can 
avoid 
or 
put 
away 
as 
‘seems 
good 
to 
him’ 
all 
‘that 
does 
not 
please 
him’. 
Nevertheless 
it 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
some 
objects 
of 
his 
aversion, 
such 
as 
certain 
evils, 
and 
especially 
sin, 
which 
his 
antecedent 
will 
repelled, 
could 
only 
have 
beenrejected 
byhisconsequent 
ordecretorywill, 
insofaras 
itwasprompted 
by 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
best, 
which 
the 
All-wise 
must 
choose 
after 
having 
taken 
all 
into 
account. 
When 
one 
says 
‘that 
sin 
offends 
God 
most, 
and 
that 
he 
detests 
it 
most’, 
these 
are 
human 
ways 
of 
speaking. 
God 
cannot, 
properly 
speaking, 
be 
offended, 
that 
is, 
injured, 
disturbed, 
disquieted 
or 
angered; 
and 
he 
detests 
nothing 
of 
that 
which 
exists, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
to 
detest 
something 
is 
to 
look 
upon 
it 
with 
abomination 
and 
in 
a 
way 
that 
causes 
us 
disgust, 
that 
greatly 
pains 
and 
distresses 
us; 
for 
God 
cannot 
suffer 
either 
vexation, 
or 
grief 
or 
discomfort; 
he 
is 
always 
altogether 
content 
and 
at 
ease. 
Yet 
these 
expressions 
in 
their 
true 
sense 
are 
justified. 
The 
supreme 
goodness 
of 
God 
causes 
his 
antecedent 
will 
to 
repel 
all 
evil, 
but 
moral 
evil 
more 
than 
any 
other: 
it 
only 
admits 
evil 
at 
all 
for 
irresistible 
superior 
reasons, 
and 
with 
great 
correctives 

which 
repair 
its 
ill 
effects 
to 
good 
advantage. 
It 
is 
true 
also 
that 
God 
could 
produce 
in 
each 
human 
soul 
all 
the 
thoughts 
that 
he 
approves: 
but 
this 
would

VII. 
‘He 
offers 
grace 
to 
people 
that 
he 
knows 
are 
destined 
not 
to 
accept 
it, 
and 
so 
destined 
by 
this 
refusal 
to 
make 
themselves 
more 
criminal 
than 
they 
would 
be 
if 
he 
had 
not 
offered 
them 
that 
grace; 
he 
assures 
them 
that 
it 
is 
his 
ardent 
wish 
that 
they 
accept 
it, 
and 
he 
does 
not 
give 
them 
the 
grace 
which 
he 
knows 
they 
would 
accept.’ 
It 
is 
true 
that 
these 
people 
become 
more 
criminal 
through 
their 
refusal 
than 
if 
one 
had 
offered 
them 
nothing, 
and 
that 
God 
knows 
this. 
Yet 
it 
is 
better 
to 
permit 
their 
crime 
than 
to 
act 
in 
a 
way 
which 
would 
render 
God 
himself 
blameworthy, 
and 
provide 
the 
criminals 
with 
some 
justification 
for 
the 
complaint 
that 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
for 
them 
to 
do 
better, 
even 
though 
they 
had 
or 
might 
have 
wished 
it. 
God 
desires 
that 
they 
receive 
such 
grace 
from 
him 
as 
they 
are 
fit 
to 
receive, 
and 
that 
they 
accept 
it; 
and 
he 
desires 
to 
give 
them 
in 
particular 
that 
grace 
whose 
acceptance 
by 
them 
he 
foresees: 
but 
it 
is 
always 
by 
a 
will 
antecedent, 
detached 
or 
particular, 
which 
cannot 
always 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
general 
plan 
of 
things. 
This 
thesis 
also 
is 
among 
the 
number 
of 
those 
which 
philosophy 
establishes 
no 
less 
than 
revelation, 
like 
three 
others 
of 
the 
seven 
that 
we 
have 
just 
stated 
here, 
the 
third, 
fourth 
and 
fifth 
being 
the 
only 
ones 
where 
revelationisnecessary. 
116. 
Here 
now 
are 
the 
nineteen 
philosophic 
maxims 
which 
M. 
Bayle 
opposestotheseventheologicalpropositions. 
I. 
‘As 
the 
infinitely 
perfect 
Being 
finds 
in 
himself 
a 
glory 
and 
a 
bliss 
that 
can 
never 
either 
diminish 
or 
increase, 
his 
goodness 
alone 
has 
determined 
him 
to 
create 
this 
universe: 
neither 
the 
ambition 
to 
be 
praised, 
nor 
any 
interested 
motive 
of 
preserving 
or 
augmenting 
his 
bliss 
and 
his 
glory, 
has 
had 
any 
part 

therein.’ 
This 
maxim 
is 
very 
good: 
praises 
of 
God 
do 
him 
no 
service, 
but 
they 
are 
of 
service 
to 
the 
men 
who 
praise 
him, 
and 
he 
desired 
their 
good. 
Nevertheless, 
when 
one 
says 
that 
goodness 
alone 
determined 
God 
to 
create 
this 
universe, 
it 
is 
well 
toadd 
that 
hisgoodnessprompted 
him 
antecedently 
to 
create 
and 
to 
produce 
all 
possible 
good; 
but 
that 
his 
wisdom 
made 
the 
choice 
and 
caused 
him 
to 
select 
the 
best 
consequently; 
and 
finally 
that 
his 
power 
gave 
him 
the 
means 
to 
carry 
out 
actually 
the 
great 
design 
which 
he 
had 
formed. 


117. 
II. 
‘The 
goodness 
of 
the 
infinitely 
perfect 
Being 
is 
infinite, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
infinite 
if 
one 
could 
conceive 
of 
a 
goodness 
greater 
than 
this. 
This 
characteristic 
of 
infinity 
is 
proper 
also 
to 
all 
his 
other 
perfections, 
to 
love 
of 
virtue, 
hatred 
of 
vice, 
etc. 
they 
must 
be 
the 
greatest 
one 
can 
imagine. 
(See 
M. 
Jurieu 
in 
the 
first 
three 
sections 
of 
the 
Judgement 
on 
Methods, 
where 
he 
argues 
constantly 
upon 
this 
principle, 
as 
upon 
a 
primary 
notion. 
See 
also 
in 
Wittich, 
De 
Providentia 
Dei, 
n. 
12, 
these 
words 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
lib. 
I, 
De 
Doctrina 
Christiana, 
c. 
7: 
“Cum 
cogitatur 
Deus, 
ita 
cogitatur, 
ut 
aliquid, 
quo 
nihil 
melius 
sit 
atque 
sublimius. 
Et 
paulo 
post: 
Nec 
quisquam 
inveniri 
potest, 
quihoc 
Deumcredatesse,quomeliusaliquid 
est.”)’ 
This 
maxim 
is 
altogether 
to 
my 
liking, 
and 
I 
draw 
from 
it 
this 
conclusion, 
that 
God 
does 
the 
very 
best 
possible: 
otherwise 
the 
exercise 
of 
his 
goodness 
would 
be 
restricted, 
and 
that 
would 
be 
restricting 
his 
goodness 
itself, 
if 
it 
did 
not 
prompt 
him 
to 
the 
best, 
if 
he 
were 
lacking 
in 
good 
will. 
Or 
again 
it 
would 
be 
restricting 
his 
wisdom 
and 
his 
power, 
if 
he 
lacked 
the 
knowledge 
necessary 
for 
discerning 
the 
best 
and 
for 
finding 
the 
means 
to 
obtain 
it, 
or 
if 
he 
lacked 
the 
strength 
necessary 
for 
employing 
these 
means. 
There 
is, 
however, 
ambiguity 
in 
the 
assertion 
that 
love 
of 
virtue 
and 
hatred 
of 
vice 
are 
infiniteinGod: 
ifthat 
were 
absolutelyandunreservedlytrue, 
inpractice 
there 
would 
be 
no 
vice 
in 
the 
world. 
But 
although 
each 
one 
of 
God’s 
perfections 
is 



infinite 
in 
itself, 
it 
is 
exercised 
only 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
object 
and 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
prompts 
it. 
Thus 
love 
of 
the 
best 
in 
the 
whole 
carries 
the 
day 
over 
all 
other 
individual 
inclinations 
or 
hatreds; 
it 
is 
the 
only 
impulse 
whose 
very 
exercise 
is 
absolutely 
infinite, 
nothing 
having 
power 
to 
prevent 
God 
from 
declaring 
himself 
for 
the 
best; 
and 
some 
vice 
being 
combined 
with 
the 
best 
possibleplan,Godpermitsit.

III. 
‘An 
infinite 
goodness 
having 
guided 
the 
Creator 
in 
theproduction 
of 
the 
world, 
all 
the 
characteristics 
of 
knowledge, 
skill, 
power 
and 
greatness 
that 
are 
displayed 
in 
his 
work 
are 
destined 
for 
the 
happiness 
of 
intelligent 
creatures. 
He 
wished 
to 
show 
forth 
his 
perfections 
only 
to 
the 
end 
that 
creatures 
of 
this 
kind 
should 
find 
their 
felicity 
in 
the 
knowledge, 
the 
admirationandtheloveofthe 
SupremeBeing.’ 
This 
maxim 
appears 
to 
me 
not 
sufficiently 
exact. 
I 
grant 
that 
the 
happiness 
of 
intelligent 
creatures 
is 
the 
principal 
part 
of 
God’s 
design, 
for 
they 
are 
most 
like 
him; 
but 
nevertheless 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
one 
can 
prove 
that 
to 
be 
his 
sole 
aim. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
realm 
of 
nature 
must 
serve 
the 
realm 
of 
grace: 
but, 
sinceallis 
connectedinGod’s 
greatdesign,wemustbelievethattherealmof 
grace 
is 
also 
in 
some 
way 
adapted 
to 
that 
of 
nature, 
so 
that 
nature 
preserves 
the 
utmost 
order 
and 
beauty, 
to 
render 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
two 
the 
most 
perfect 
that 
can 
be. 
And 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
suppose 
that 
God, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
some 
lessening 
of 
moral 
evil, 
would 
reverse 
the 
whole 
order 
of 
nature. 
Each 
perfection 
or 
imperfection 
in 
the 
creature 
has 
its 
value, 
but 
there 
is 
none 
that 
hasan 
infinitevalue. 
Thus 
the 
moral 
or 
physical 
good 
and 
evil 
of 
rational 
creatures 
does 
not 
infinitely 
exceed 
the 
good 
and 
evil 
which 
is 
simply 
metaphysical, 
namely 
that 
which 
lies 
in 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
other 
creatures; 
and 
yet 
one 
would 
be 
bound 
to 
say 
this 
if 
the 
present 
maxim 
were 
strictly 
true. 
When 
God 
justified 
to 
the 
Prophet 
Jonah 
the 
pardon 
that 
he 
had 
granted 
to 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
Nineveh, 
he 
even 
touched 
upon 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
beasts 



who 
would 
have 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
ruin 
of 
this 
great 
city. 
No 
substance 
is 
absolutely 
contemptible 
or 
absolutely 
precious 
before 
God. 
And 
the 
abuse 
or 
the 
exaggerated 
extension 
of 
the 
present 
maxim 
appears 
to 
be 
in 
part 
the 
source 
of 
the 
difficulties 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
puts 
forward. 
It 
is 
certain 
that 
God 
sets 
greater 
store 
by 
a 
man 
than 
a 
lion; 
nevertheless 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
said 
with 
certainty 
that 
God 
prefers 
a 
single 
man 
in 
all 
respects 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
lion-
kind. 
Even 
should 
that 
be 
so, 
it 
would 
by 
no 
means 
follow 
that 
the 
interest 
of 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
men 
would 
prevail 
over 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
general 
disorder 
diffused 
through 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
creatures. 
This 
opinion 
would 
be 
a 
remnant 
of 
the 
old 
and 
somewhat 
discredited 
maxim, 
that 
all 
is 
made 
solely 
for 
man. 


119. 
IV. 
‘The 
benefits 
he 
imparts 
to 
the 
creatures 
that 
are 
capable 
of 
felicity 
tend 
only 
to 
their 
happiness. 
He 
therefore 
does 
not 
permit 
that 
these 
should 
serve 
to 
make 
them 
unhappy, 
and, 
if 
the 
wrong 
use 
that 
they 
made 
of 
them 
were 
capable 
of 
destroying 
them, 
he 
would 
give 
them 
sure 
means 
of 
always 
using 
them 
well. 
Otherwise 
they 
would 
not 
be 
true 
benefits, 
and 
his 
goodness 
would 
be 
smaller 
than 
that 
we 
can 
conceive 
of 
in 
another 
benefactor.

It 
is 
not 
strictly 
true 
(though 
it 
appear 
plausible) 
that 
the 
benefits 
God 
imparts 
to 
the 
creatures 
who 
are 
capable 
of 
felicity 
tend 
solely 
to 
their 
happiness. 
All 
is 
connected 
in 
Nature; 
and 
if 
a 
skilled 
artisan, 
an 
engineer, 
an 
architect, 
a 
wise 
politician 
often 
makes 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
serve 
several 
ends, 
if 
he 
makes 
a 
double 
hit 
with 
a 
single 
throw, 
when 
that 
can 
be 
done 
conveniently, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
God, 
whose 
wisdom 
and 
power 
are 
perfect, 
does 
so 
always. 
That 
is 
husbanding 
the 
ground, 
the 
time, 
the 
place, 
the 
material, 
which 
make 
up 
as 
it 
were 
his 
outlay. 
Thus 
God 
has 
more 
than 
one 
purpose 
in 
his 
projects. 



The 
felicity 
of 
all 
rational 
creatures 
is 
one 
of 
the 
aims 
he 
has 
in 
view; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
his 
whole 
aim, 
nor 
even 
his 
final 
aim. 
Therefore 
it 
happens 
that 
the 
unhappiness 
of 
some 
of 
these 
creatures 
may 
come 
about 
by 
concomitance, 
and 
as 
a 
result 
of 
other 
greater 
goods: 
this 
I 
have 
already 
explained, 
and 
M. 
Bayle 
has 
to 
some 
extent 
acknowledged 
it. 
The 
goods 
as 
such, 
considered 
in 
themselves, 
are 
the 
object 
of 
the 
antecedent 
will 
of 
God. 
God 
will 
produce 
as 
much 
reason 
and 
knowledge 
in 
the 
universe 
as 
his 
plan 
can 
admit. 
One 
can 
conceive 
of 
a 
mean 
between 
an 
antecedent 
will 
altogether 
pure 
and 
primitive, 
and 
a 
consequent 
and 
final 
will. 
The 
primitive 
antecedent 
will 
has 
as 
its 
object 
each 
good 
and 
each 
evil 
in 
itself, 
detached 
from 
all 
combination, 
and 
tends 
to 
advance 
the 
good 
and 
prevent 
the 
evil. 
The 
mediate 
will 
relates 
to 
combinations, 
as 
when 
one 
attaches 
a 
good 
to 
an 
evil: 
then 
the 
will 
will 
have 
some 
tendency 
towards 
this 
combination 
when 
the 
good 
exceeds 
the 
evil 
therein. 
But 
the 
final 
and 
decisive 
will 
results 
from 
consideration 
of 
all 
the 
goods 
and 
all 
the 
evils 
that 
enter 
into 
our 
deliberation, 
it 
results 
from 
a 
total 
combination. 
This 
shows 
that 
a 
mediate 
will, 
although 
it 
may 
in 
a 
sense 
pass 
as 
consequent 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
pure 
and 
primitive 
antecedent 
will, 
must 
be 
considered 
antecedent 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
final 
and 
decretory 
will. 
God 
gives 
reason 
to 
the 
human 
race; 
misfortunes 
arise 
thence 
by 
concomitance. 
His 
pure 
antecedent 
will 
tends 
towards 
giving 
reason, 
as 
a 
great 
good, 
and 
preventing 
the 
evils 
in 
question. 
But 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
the 
evils 
that 
accompany 
this 
gift 
which 
God 
has 
made 
to 
us 
of 
reason, 
the 
compound, 
made 
up 
of 
the 
combination 
of 
reason 
and 
of 
these 
evils, 
will 
be 
the 
object 
of 
a 
mediate 
will 
of 
God, 
which 
will 
tend 
towards 
producing 
or 
preventing 
this 
compound, 
according 
as 
the 
good 
or 
the 
evil 
prevails 
therein. 
But 
even 
though 
it 
should 
prove 
that 
reason 
did 
more 
harm 
than 
good 
to 
men 
(which, 
however, 
I 
do 
not 
admit), 
whereupon 
the 
mediate 
will 
of 
God 
would 
discard 
it 
with 
all 
its 
concomitants, 
it 
might 
still 
be 
the 
case 
that 
it 
was 
more 
in 



accordance 
with 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
universe 
to 
give 
reason 
to 
men, 
notwithstanding 
all 
the 
evil 
consequences 
which 
it 
might 
have 
with 
reference 
to 
them. 
Consequently, 
the 
final 
will 
or 
the 
decree 
of 
God, 
resulting 
from 
all 
the 
considerations 
he 
can 
have, 
would 
be 
to 
give 
it 
to 
them. 
And, 
far 
from 
being 
subject 
to 
blame 
for 
this, 
he 
would 
be 
blameworthy 
if 
he 
did 
not 
so. 
Thus 
the 
evil, 
or 
the 
mixture 
of 
goods 
and 
evils 
wherein 
the 
evil 
prevails, 
happens 
only 
by 
concomitance, 
because 
it 
is 
connected 
with 
greater 
goods 
that 
are 
outside 
this 
mixture. 
This 
mixture, 
therefore, 
or 
this 
compound, 
is 
not 
to 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
grace 
or 
as 
a 
gift 
from 
God 
to 
us; 
but 
the 
good 
that 
is 
found 
mingled 
therein 
will 
nevertheless 
be 
good. 
Such 
is 
God’s 
gift 
of 
reason 
to 
those 
who 
make 
ill 
use 
thereof. 
It 
is 
always 
a 
good 
in 
itself; 
but 
the 
combination 
of 
this 
good 
with 
the 
evils 
that 
proceed 
from 
its 
abuse 
is 
not 
a 
good 
with 
regard 
to 
those 
who 
in 
consequence 
thereof 
become 
unhappy. 
Yet 
it 
comestobe 
byconcomitance,becauseit 
servesagreatergoodin 
relationto 
the 
universe. 
And 
it 
is 
doubtless 
that 
which 
prompted 
God 
to 
give 
reason 
to 
those 
who 
have 
made 
it 
an 
instrument 
of 
their 
unhappiness. 
Or, 
to 
put 
it 
more 
precisely, 
in 
accordance 
with 
my 
system 
God, 
having 
found 
among 
the 
possible 
beings 
some 
rational 
creatures 
who 
misuse 
their 
reason, 
gave 
existence 
to 
those 
who 
are 
included 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
plan 
of 
the 
universe. 
Thus 
nothing 
prevents 
us 
from 
admitting 
that 
God 
grants 
goods 
which 
turn 
into 
evil 
by 
the 
fault 
of 
men, 
this 
often 
happening 
to 
men 
in 
just 
punishment 
of 
the 
misuse 
they 
had 
made 
of 
God’s 
grace. 
Aloysius 
Novarinus 
wrote 
a 
book 
De 
Occultis 
Dei 
Beneficiis: 
one 
could 
write 
one 
De 
Occultis 
Dei 
Poenis. 
This 
saying 
of 
Claudian 
would 
be 
in 
place 
here 
with 
regard 
to 
some 
persons: 


Tolluntur 
in 
altum, 
Ut 
lapsu 
graviore 
ruant. 


But 
to 
say 
that 
God 
should 
not 
give 
a 
good 
which 
he 
knows 
an 
evil 
will 
will 
abuse, 
when 
the 
general 
plan 
of 
things 
demands 
that 
he 
give 
it; 
or 
again 



to 
say 
that 
he 
should 
give 
certain 
means 
for 
preventing 
it, 
contrary 
to 
this 
same 
general 
order: 
that 
is 
to 
wish 
(as 
I 
have 
observed 
already) 
that 
God 
himself 
become 
blameworthy 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
man 
from 
being 
so. 
To 
object, 
as 
people 
do 
here, 
that 
the 
goodness 
of 
God 
would 
be 
smaller 
than 
that 
of 
another 
benefactor 
who 
would 
give 
a 
more 
useful 
gift, 
is 
to 
overlook 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
goodness 
of 
a 
benefactor 
is 
not 
measured 
by 
a 
single 
benefit. 
It 
may 
well 
be 
that 
a 
gift 
from 
a 
private 
person 
is 
greater 
than 
one 
from 
a 
prince, 
but 
the 
gifts 
of 
this 
private 
person 
all 
taken 
together 
will 
be 
much 
inferior 
to 
the 
prince’s 
gifts 
all 
together. 
Thus 
one 
can 
esteem 
fittingly 
the 
good 
things 
done 
by 
God 
only 
when 
one 
considers 
their 
whole 
extent 
by 
relating 
them 
to 
the 
entire 
universe. 
Moreover, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
the 
gifts 
given 
in 
the 
expectation 
that 
they 
will 
harm 
are 
the 
gifts 
of 
an 
enemy, 
‛εχθρων 
δωρααδωρα, 


Hostibus 
eveniant 
talia 
dona 
meis. 


But 
that 
applies 
to 
when 
there 
is 
malice 
or 
guilt 
in 
him 
who 
gives 
them, 
as 
there 
was 
in 
that 
Eutrapelus 
of 
whom 
Horace 
speaks, 
who 
did 
good 
to 
people 
in 
order 
to 
give 
them 
the 
means 
of 
destroying 
themselves. 
His 
design 
was 
evil, 
but 
God’s 
design 
cannot 
be 
better 
than 
it 
is. 
Must 
God 
spoil 
his 
system, 
must 
there 
be 
less 
beauty, 
perfection 
and 
reason 
in 
the 
universe, 
because 
there 
are 
people 
who 
misuse 
reason? 
The 
common 
sayings 
are 
in 
place 
here: 
Abusus 
non 
tollit 
usum;thereis 
scandalum 
datum 
et 
scandalum 
acceptum. 


120. 
V. 
‘A 
maleficent 
being 
is 
very 
capable 
of 
heaping 
magnificent 
gifts 
upon 
his 
enemies, 
when 
he 
knows 
that 
they 
will 
make 
thereof 
a 
use 
that 
will 
destroy 
them. 
It 
therefore 
does 
not 
beseem 
the 
infinitely 
good 
Being 
to 
give 
to 
creatures 
a 
free 
will, 
whereof, 
as 
he 
knows 
for 
certain, 
they 
would 
make 
a 
use 
that 
would 
render 
them 
unhappy. 
Therefore 
if 
he 
gives 
them 
free 
will 
he 
combines 
with 
it 
the 
art 
of 
using 
it 
always 
opportunely, 
and 
permits 
not 
that 
they 
neglect 
the 
practice 
of 
this 
art 
in 
any 
conjuncture; 
and 
if 
there 
were 
no 

sure 
means 
of 
determining 
the 
good 
use 
of 
this 
free 
will, 
he 
would 
rather 
take 
from 
them 
this 
faculty, 
than 
allow 
it 
to 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
their 
unhappiness. 
That 
is 
the 
more 
manifest, 
as 
free 
will 
is 
a 
grace 
which 
he 
has 
given 
them 
of 
his 
own 
choice 
and 
without 
their 
asking 
for 
it; 
so 
that 
he 
would 
be 
more 
answerable 
for 
the 
unhappiness 
it 
would 
bring 
upon 
them 
than 
if 
he 
had 
only 
grantedit 
inresponse 
totheirimportunateprayers.’ 


What 
was 
said 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
remark 
on 
the 
preceding 
maxim 
ought 
to 
be 
repeated 
here, 
and 
is 
sufficient 
to 
counter 
the 
present 
maxim. 
Moreover, 
the 
author 
is 
still 
presupposing 
that 
false 
maxim 
advanced 
as 
the 
third, 
stating 
that 
the 
happiness 
of 
rational 
creatures 
is 
the 
sole 
aim 
of 
God. 
If 
that 
were 
so, 
perhaps 
neither 
sin 
nor 
unhappiness 
would 
ever 
occur, 
even 
by 
concomitance. 
God 
would 
have 
chosen 
a 
sequence 
of 
possibles 
where 
all 
these 
evils 
would 
be 
excluded. 
But 
God 
would 
fail 
in 
what 
is 
due 
to 
the 
universe, 
that 
is, 
in 
what 
he 
owes 
to 
himself. 
If 
there 
were 
only 
spirits 
they 
would 
be 
without 
the 
required 
connexion, 
without 
the 
order 
of 
time 
and 
place. 
This 
order 
demands 
matter, 
movement 
and 
its 
laws; 
to 
adjust 
these 
to 
spirits 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
way 
means 
to 
return 
to 
our 
world. 
When 
one 
looks 
at 
things 
only 
in 
the 
mass, 
one 
imagines 
to 
be 
practicable 
a 
thousand 
things 
that 
cannot 
properly 
take 
place. 
To 
wish 
that 
God 
should 
not 
give 
free 
will 
to 
rational 
creatures 
is 
to 
wish 
that 
there 
be 
none 
of 
these 
creatures; 
and 
to 
wish 
that 
God 
should 
prevent 
them 
from 
misusing 
it 
is 
to 
wish 
that 
there 
be 
none 
but 
these 
creatures 
alone, 
together 
with 
what 
was 
made 
for 
them 
only. 
If 
God 
had 
none 
but 
these 
creatures 
in 
view, 
he 
would 
doubtless 
prevent 
them 
from 
destroying 
themselves. 
One 
may 
say 
in 
a 
sense, 
however, 
that 
God 
has 
given 
to 
these 
creatures 
the 
art 
of 
always 
making 
good 
use 
of 
their 
free 
will, 
for 
the 
natural 
light 
of 
reason 
is 
this 
art. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
always 
to 
have 
the 
will 
to 
do 
good, 
and 
often 
creatures 
lack 
the 
means 
of 
giving 
themselves 
the 
will 
they 
ought 
to 
have; 
often 
they 
even 
lack 
the 
will 
to 
use 
those 
means 



which 
indirectly 
give 
a 
good 
will. 
Of 
this 
I 
have 
already 
spoken 
more 
than 
once. 
This 
fault 
must 
be 
admitted, 
and 
one 
must 
even 
acknowledge 
that 
God 
would 
perhaps 
have 
been 
able 
to 
exempt 
creatures 
from 
that 
fault, 
since 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent, 
so 
it 
seems, 
the 
existence 
of 
some 
whose 
nature 
it 
would 
be 
always 
to 
have 
good 
will. 
But 
I 
reply 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not 
feasible 
for 
all 
rational 
creatures 
to 
have 
so 
great 
a 
perfection, 
and 
such 
as 
would 
bring 
them 
so 
close 
to 
the 
Divinity. 
It 
may 
even 
be 
that 
that 
can 
only 
be 
made 
possible 
by 
a 
special 
divine 
grace. 
But 
in 
this 
case, 
would 
it 
be 
proper 
for 
God 
to 
grant 
it 
to 
all, 
that 
is, 
always 
to 
act 
miraculously 
in 
respect 
of 
all 
rational 
creatures? 
Nothing 
would 
be 
less 
rationalthanthese 
perpetual 
miracles. 
There 
are 
degrees 
among 
creatures: 
the 
general 
order 
requires 
it. 
And 
it 
appears 
quite 
consistent 
with 
the 
order 
of 
divine 
government 
that 
the 
great 
privilege 
of 
strengthening 
in 
the 
good 
should 
be 
granted 
more 
easily 
to 
those 
who 
had 
a 
good 
will 
when 
they 
were 
in 
a 
more 
imperfect 
state, 
in 
the 
state 
of 
struggle 
and 
of 
pilgrimage, 
in 
Ecclesia 
militante, 
in 
statu 
viatorum. 
The 
good 
angels 
themselves 
were 
not 
created 
incapable 
of 
sin. 
Nevertheless 
I 
would 
not 
dare 
to 
assert 
that 
there 
are 
no 
blessed 
creatures 
born, 
or 
such 
as 
are 
sinless 
and 
holy 
by 
their 
nature. 
There 
are 
perhaps 
people 
who 
give 
this 
privilege 
to 
the 
Blessed 
Virgin, 
since, 
moreover, 
the 
Roman 
Church 
to-day 
places 
her 
above 
the 
angels. 
But 
it 
suffices 
us 
that 
the 
universe 
is 
very 
great 
and 
very 
varied: 
to 
wish 
to 
limit 
it 
is 
to 
have 
little 
knowledge 
thereof. 
‘But’, 
M. 
Bayle 
goes 
on, 
‘God 
has 
given 
free 
will 
to 
creatures 
capable 
of 
sinning, 
without 
their 
having 
asked 
him 
for 
this 
grace. 
And 
he 
who 
gave 
such 
a 
gift 
would 
be 
more 
answerable 
for 
the 
unhappiness 
that 
it 
brought 
upon 
those 
who 
made 
use 
of 
it, 
than 
if 
he 
had 
granted 
it 
only 
in 
response 
to 
their 
importunate 
prayers.’ 
But 
importunity 
in 
prayers 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
God; 
he 
knows 
better 
than 
we 
what 
we 
need, 
and 
he 
only 
grants 
what 
serves 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
whole. 
It 
seems 
that 
M. 



Bayle 
here 
makes 
free 
will 
consist 
in 
the 
faculty 
for 
sinning; 
yet 
he 
acknowledges 
elsewhere 
that 
God 
and 
the 
Saints 
are 
free, 
without 
having 
this 
faculty. 
However 
that 
may 
be, 
I 
have 
already 
shown 
fully 
that 
God, 
doing 
whathiswisdomandhisgoodnesscombinedordain,is 
not 
answerableforthe 
evil 
that 
he 
permits. 
Even 
men, 
when 
they 
do 
their 
duty, 
are 
not 
answerable 
forconsequences, 
whetherthey 
foresee 
themornot.

‘Itisas 
sure 
a 
means 
oftakingaman’slifetogive 
him 
a 
silk 
cord 
that 
one 
knows 
certainly 
he 
will 
make 
use 
of 
freely 
to 
strangle 
himself, 
as 
to 
plant 
a 
few 
dagger 
thrusts 
in 
his 
body. 
One 
desires 
his 
death 
not 
less 
when 
one 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
first 
way, 
than 
when 
one 
employs 
the 
second: 
it 
even 
seems 
as 
though 
one 
desires 
it 
with 
a 
more 
malicious 
intention, 
since 
one 
tends 
to 
leave 
to 
him 
the 
whole 
trouble 
and 
the 
whole 
blame 
of 
his 
destruction.’ 
Those 
who 
write 
treatises 
on 
Duties 
(De 
Officiis) 
as, 
for 
instance, 
Cicero, 
St. 
Ambrose, 
Grotius, 
Opalenius, 
Sharrok, 
Rachelius, 
Pufendorf, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Casuists, 
teach 
that 
there 
are 
cases 
where 
one 
is 
not 
obliged 
to 
return 
to 
its 
owner 
a 
thing 
deposited: 
for 
example, 
one 
will 
not 
give 
back 
a 
dagger 
whenone 
knowsthathewho 
hasdeposited 
itis 
about 
tostab 
someone. 
Letus 
pretend 
that 
I 
have 
in 
my 
hands 
the 
fatal 
draught 
that 
Meleager’s 
mother 
will 
make 
use 
of 
to 
kill 
him; 
the 
magic 
javelin 
that 
Cephalus 
will 
unwittingly 
employ 
to 
kill 
his 
Procris; 
the 
horses 
of 
Theseus 
that 
will 
tear 
to 
pieces 
Hippolytus, 
his 
son: 
these 
things 
are 
demanded 
back 
from 
me, 
and 
I 
am 
right 
in 
refusing 
them, 
knowing 
the 
use 
that 
will 
be 
made 
of 
them. 
But 
how 
will 
it 
be 
if 
a 
competent 
judge 
orders 
me 
to 
restore 
them, 
when 
I 
cannot 
prove 
to 
him 
what 
I 
know 
of 
the 
evil 
consequences 
that 
restitution 
will 
have, 
Apollo 
perchance 
having 
giventome, 
as 
to 
Cassandra, 
the 
gift 
of 
prophecyunder 
the 
condition 
that 
I 
shall 
not 
be 
believed? 
I 
should 
then 
be 
compelled 
to 
make 



restitution, 
having 
noalternativeother 
than 
my 
owndestruction: 
thus 
I 
cannot 
escape 
from 
contributing 
towards 
the 
evil. 
Another 
comparison: 
Jupiter 
promises 
Semele, 
the 
Sun 
Phaeton, 
Cupid 
Psyche 
to 
grant 
whatever 
favour 
theothershallask. 
TheyswearbytheStyx, 


Di 
cujus

et

Onewouldgladly

Voluit 
Deus

Opprimere; 
exierat

vox 
properata 
sub 
auras. 
One 
would 
gladly 
draw 
back 
after 
the 
request 
was 
made, 
making 
vain 


remonstrances; 
but 
they 
press 
you, 
they 
say 
to 
you: 
‘Do 
you 
make 
oaths 
that 
you 
will 
not 
keep?’ 
The 
law 
of 
the 
Styx 
is 
inviolable, 
one 
must 
needs 
submit 
to 
it; 
if 
one 
has 
erred 
in 
making 
the 
oath, 
one 
would 
err 
more 
in 
not 
keeping 
it; 
the 
promise 
must 
be 
fulfilled, 
however 
harmful 
it 
may 
be 
to 
him 
who 
exacts 
it. 
It 
would 
be 
ruinous 
to 
you 
if 
you 
did 
not 
fulfil 
it. 
It 
seems 
as 
though 
the 
moral 
of 
these 
fables 
implies 
that 
a 
supreme 
necessity 
may 
constrain 
one 
to 
comply 
with 
evil. 
God, 
in 
truth, 
knows 
no 
other 
judge 
that 
can 
compel 
him 
to 
give 
what 
may 
turn 
to 
evil, 
he 
is 
not 
like 
Jupiter 
who 
fears 
the 
Styx. 
But 
his 
own 
wisdom 
is 
the 
greatest 
judge 
that 
he 
can 
find, 
there 
is 
no 
appeal 
from 
its 
judgements: 
they 
are 
the 
decrees 
of 
destiny. 
The 
eternal 
verities, 
objects 
of 
his 
wisdom, 
are 
more 
inviolable 
than 
the 
Styx. 
These 
laws 
and 
this 
judge 
do 
not 
constrain: 
they 
are 
stronger, 
for 
they 
persuade. 
Wisdom 
only 
shows 
God 
the 
best 
possible 
exercise 
of 
his 
goodness: 
after 
that, 
the 
evil 
that 
occurs 
is 
aninevitable 
resultofthe 
best. 
Iwilladdsomethingstronger:To 
permitthe 
evil,asGod 
permits 
it,isthegreatest

Si

non

ille 
bonus. 


One 
would 
need 
to 
have 
a 
bent 
towards 
perversity 
to 
say 
after 
this 
that 
it 
is 
more 
malicious 
to 
leave 
to 
someone 
the 
whole 
trouble 
and 
the 
whole 
blame 
of 
his 
destruction. 
When 
God 
does 
leave 
it 
to 
a 
man, 
it 
has 
belonged 
to 
him 



since 
before 
his 
existence; 
it 
was 
already 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
him 
as 
still 
merely 
possible, 
before 
the 
decree 
of 
God 
which 
makes 
him 
to 
exist. 
Can 
one, 
then,

Thereis 
the

VII. 
‘A 
true 
benefactor 
gives 
promptly, 
and 
does 
not 
wait 
to 
give 
until 
those 
he 
loves 
have 
suffered 
long 
miseries 
from 
the 
privation 
of 
what 
he 
could 
have 
imparted 
to 
them 
at 
first 
very 
easily, 
and 
without 
causing 
any 
inconvenience 
to 
himself. 
If 
the 
limitation 
of 
his 
forces 
does 
not 
permit 
him 
to 
do 
good 
without 
inflicting 
pain 
or 
some 
other 
inconvenience, 
he 
acquiesces 
in 
this, 
but 
only 
regretfully, 
and 
he 
never 
employs 
this 
way 
of 
rendering 
service 
when 
he 
can 
render 
it 
without 
mingling 
any 
kind 
of 
evil 
in 
his 
favours. 
If 
the 
profit 
one 
could 
derive 
from 
the 
evils 
he 
inflicted 
could 
spring 
as 
easily 
from 
an 
unalloyed 
good 
as 
from 
those 
evils, 
he 
would 
take 
the 
straight 
road 
of 
unalloyed 
good, 
and 
not 
the 
indirect 
road 
that 
would 
lead 
from 
the 
evil 
to 
the 
good. 
If 
he 
showers 
riches 
and 
honours, 
it 
is 
not 
to 
the 
end 
that 
those 
who 
have 
enjoyed 
them, 
when 
they 
come 
to 
lose 
them, 
should 
be 
all 
the 
more 
deeply 
afflicted 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
previous 
experience 
of 
pleasure, 
and 
that 
thus 
they 
should 
become 
more 
unhappy 
than 
the 
persons 
who 
have 
always 
been 
deprived 
of 
these 
advantages. 
A 
malicious 
being 
would 
shower 
good 
things 
at 
such 
a 
price 
upon 
the 
people 
for 
whom 
he 
had 
themosthatred.’

passage 
of 
Aristotle,

Insigniore 
ut

his 
privet

All 
these 
objections 
depend 
almost 
on 
the 
same 
sophism; 
they 
change 
and 


mutilate 
the 
fact, 
they 
only 
half 
record 
things: 
God 
has 
care 
for 
men, 
he 
loves 
the 
human 
race, 
he 
wishes 
it 
well, 
nothing 
so 
true. 
Yet 
he 
allows 
men 
to 
fall, 
he 
often 
allows 
them 
to 
perish, 
he 
gives 
them 
goods 
that 
tend 
towards 
their 
destruction; 
and 
when 
he 
makes 
someone 
happy, 
it 
is 
after 
many 
sufferings: 
where 
is 
his 
affection, 
where 
is 
his 
goodness 
or 
again 
where 
is 
his 
power? 
Vain 
objections, 
which 
suppress 
the 
main 
point, 
which 
ignore 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
of 
God 
one 
speaks. 
It 
is 
as 
though 
one 
were 
speaking 
of 
a 
mother, 
a 
guardian, 
a 
tutor, 
whose 
well-nigh 
only 
care 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
upbringing, 
the 
preservation, 
the 
happiness 
of 
the 
person 
in 
question, 
and 
who 
neglect 
their 
duty. 
God 
takes 
care 
of 
the 
universe, 
he 
neglects 
nothing, 
he 
chooses 
what 
is 
best 
on 
the 
whole. 
If 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
that 
someone 
is 
wicked 
and 
unhappy, 
it 
behoved 
him 
to 
be 
so. 
God 
(so 
they 
say) 
could 
have 
given 
happiness 
to 
all, 
he 
could 
have 
given 
it 
promptly 
and 
easily, 
and 
without 
causinghimselfany 
inconvenience,forhecan 
doall. 
Butshould 
he?Sincehe 
does 
not 
so, 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
that 
he 
had 
to 
act 
altogether 
differently. 
If 
we 
infer 
from 
this 
either 
that 
God 
only 
regretfully, 
and 
owing 
to 
lack 
of 
power, 
fails 
to 
make 
men 
happy 
and 
to 
give 
the 
good 
first 
of 
all 
and 
without 
admixture 
of 
evil, 
or 
else 
that 
he 
lacks 
the 
good 
will 
to 
give 
it 
unreservedly 
and 
for 
good 
and 
all, 
then 
we 
are 
comparing 
our 
true 
God 
with 
the 
God 
of 
Herodotus, 
full 
of 
envy, 
or 
with 
the 
demon 
of 
the 
poet 
whose 
iambics 
Aristotle 
quotes, 
and 
I 
have 
just 
translated 
into 
Latin, 
who 
gives 
good 
things 
in 
order 
that 
he 
may 
cause 
more 
affliction 
by 
taking 
them 
away. 
That 
would 
be 
trifling 
with 
God 
in 
perpetual 
anthropomorphisms, 
representing 
him 
as 
a 
man 
who 
must 
give 
himself 
up 
completely 
to 
one 
particular 
business, 
whose 
goodness 
must 
be 
chiefly 
exercised 
upon 
those 
objects 
alone 
which 
are 
known 
to 
us, 
and 
who 



lacks 
either 
aptitude 
or 
good 
will. 
God 
is 
not 
lacking 
therein, 
he 
could 
do 
the 
good 
that 
we 
would 
desire; 
he 
even 
wishes 
it, 
taking 
it 
separately, 
but 
he 
must 
not 
do 
it 
in 
preference 
to 
other 
greater 
goods 
which 
are 
opposed 
to 
it. 
Moreover, 
one 
has 
no 
cause 
to 
complain 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
usually 
one 
attains 
salvation 
only 
through 
many 
sufferings, 
and 
by 
bearing 
the 
cross 
of 
Jesus 
Christ. 
These 
evils 
serve 
to 
make 
the 
elect 
imitators 
of 
their 
master, 
and 
to 
increase 
their 
happiness.

VIII. 
‘The 
greatest 
and 
the 
most 
substantial 
glory 
that 
he 
who 
is 
the 
master 
of 
others 
can 
gain 
is 
to 
maintain 
amongst 
them 
virtue, 
order, 
peace, 
contentment 
of 
mind. 
The 
glory 
that 
he 
would 
derive 
from 
their 
unhappiness 
can 
benothingbuta 
false 
glory.’ 
If 
we 
knew 
the 
city 
of 
God 
just 
as 
it 
is, 
we 
should 
see 
that 
it 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
state 
which 
can 
be 
devised; 
that 
virtue 
and 
happiness 
reign 
there, 
as 
far 
as 
is 
possible, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
best; 
that 
sin 
and 
unhappiness 
(whose 
entire 
exclusion 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
reasons 
of 
the 
supreme 
order 
did 
not 
permit), 
are 
well-nigh 
nothing 
there 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
good, 
and 
even 
are 
of 
service 
for 
greater 
good. 
Now 
since 
these 
evils 
were 
to 
exist, 
there 
must 
needs 
be 
some 
appointed 
to 
be 
subject 
to 
them, 
and 
we 
are 
those 
people. 
If 
it 
were 
others, 
would 
there 
not 
be 
the 
same 
appearance 
of 
evil? 
Or 
rather, 
would 
not 
these 
others 
be 
those 
known 
as 
We? 
When 
God 
derives 
some 
glory 
from 
the 
evil 
through 
having 
made 
it 
serve 
a 
greater 
good, 
it 
was 
proper 
that 
he 
should 
derive 
that 
glory. 
It 
is 
not 
therefore 
a 
false 
glory, 
as 
would 
be 
that 
of 
a 
prince 
who 
overthrew 
his 
state 
in 
order 
to 
havethehonourofsettingitupagain.

IX. 
‘The 
way 
whereby 
that 
master 
can 
give 
proof 
of 
greatest 
love 
for 
virtue 
is 
to 
cause 
it, 
if 
he 
can, 
to 
be 
always 
practised 
without 
any 
mixture 
of 
vice. 
If 
it 
is 
easy 
for 
him 
to 
procure 
for 
his 
subjects 
this 
advantage, 
and 
nevertheless 
he 
permits 
vice 
to 
raise 
its 
head, 
save 
that 
he 
punishes 
it 
finally 

after 
having 
long 
tolerated 
it, 
his 
affection 
for 
virtue 
is 
not 
the 
greatest 
one 
can 
conceive; 
itisthereforenotinfinite.’ 


I 
am 
not 
yet 
half 
way 
through 
the 
nineteen 
maxims, 
and 
already 
I 
am 
weary 
of 
refuting, 
and 
making 
the 
same 
answer 
always. 
M. 
Bayle 
multiplies 
unnecessarily 
his 
so-called 
maxims 
in 
opposition 
to 
my 
dogmas. 
If 
things 
connected 
together 
may 
be 
separated, 
the 
parts 
from 
their 
whole, 
the 
human 
kind 
from 
the 
universe, 
God’s 
attributes 
the 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
power 
from 
wisdom, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
God 
can 
cause 
virtue 
to 
be 
in 
the 
world 
without 
any 
mixture 
of 
vice, 
and 
even 
that 
he 
can 
do 
so 
easily. 
But, 
since 
he 
has 
permitted 
vice, 
it 
must 
be 
that 
that 
order 
of 
the 
universe 
which 
was 
found 
preferable 
to 
every 
other 
plan 
required 
it. 
One 
must 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
not 
permitted 
to 
do 
otherwise, 
since 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
do 
better. 
It 
is 
a 
hypothetical 
necessity, 
a 
moral 
necessity, 
which, 
far 
from 
being 
contrary 
to 
freedom, 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
its 
choice. 
Quae 
rationi 
contraria 
sunt, 
ea 
nec 
fieri 
a 
Sapiente 
posse 
credendum 
est. 
The 
objection 
is 
made 
here, 
that 
God’s 
affection 
for 
virtue 
is 
therefore 
not 
the 
greatest 
which 
can 
be 
conceived, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
infinite. 
To 
that 
an 
answer 
has 
already 
been 
given 
on 
the 
second 
maxim, 
in 
the 
assertion 
that 
God’s 
affection 
for 
any 
created 
thing 
whatsoever 
is 
proportionate 
to 
the 
value 
of 
the 
thing. 
Virtue 
is 
the 
noblest 
quality 
of 
created 
things, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
only 
good 
quality 
of 
creatures. 
There 
are 
innumerable 
others 
which 
attract 
the 
inclination 
of 
God: 
from 
all 
these 
inclinations 
there 
results 
the 
most 
possible 
good, 
and 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
if 
there 
were 
only 
virtue, 
if 
there 
were 
only 
rational 
creatures, 
there 
would 
be 
less 
good. 
Midas 
proved 
to 
be 
less 
rich 
when 
he 
had 
only 
gold. 
And 
besides, 
wisdom 
must 
vary. 
To 
multiply 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
only 
would 
be 
superfluity, 
and 
poverty 
too. 
To 
have 
a 
thousand 
well-bound 
Vergils 
in 
one’s 
library, 
always 
to 
sing 
the 
airs 
from 
the 
opera 
of 
Cadmus 
and 
Hermione, 
to 
break 
all 
the 
china 
in 
order 
only 
to 
have 
cups 
of 
gold, 
to 
have 
only 
diamond 



buttons, 
to 
eat 
nothing 
but 
partridges, 
to 
drink 
only 
Hungarian 
or 
Shiraz 
wine 


— 
would 
one 
call 
that 
reason? 
Nature 
had 
need 
of 
animals, 
plants, 
inanimate 
bodies; 
there 
are 
in 
these 
creatures, 
devoid 
of 
reason, 
marvels 
which 
serve 
for 
exercise 
of 
the 
reason. 
What 
would 
an 
intelligent 
creature 
do 
if 
there 
were 
no 
unintelligent 
things? 
What 
would 
it 
think 
of, 
if 
there 
were 
neither 
movement, 
nor 
matter, 
nor 
sense? 
If 
it 
had 
only 
distinct 
thoughts 
it 
would 
be 
a 
God, 
its 
wisdom 
would 
be 
without 
bounds: 
that 
is 
one 
of 
the 
results 
of 
my 
meditations. 
As 
soon 
as 
there 
is 
a 
mixture 
of 
confused 
thoughts, 
there 
is 
sense, 
there 
is 
matter. 
For 
these 
confused 
thoughts 
come 
from 
the 
relation 
of 
all 
things 
one 
to 
the 
other 
by 
way 
of 
duration 
and 
extent. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
in 
my 
philosophy 
there 
is 
no 
rational 
creature 
without 
some 
organic 
body, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
created 
spirit 
entirely 
detached 
from 
matter. 
But 
these 
organic 
bodies 
vary 
no 
less 
in 
perfection 
than 
the 
spirits 
to 
which 
they 
belong. 
Therefore, 
since 
God’s 
wisdom 
must 
have 
a 
world 
of 
bodies, 
a 
world 
of 
substances 
capable 
of 
perception 
and 
incapable 
of 
reason; 
since, 
in 
short, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
choose 
from 
all 
the 
things 
possible 
what 
produced 
the 
best 
effect 
together, 
and 
since 
vice 
entered 
in 
by 
this 
door, 
God 
would 
not 
have 
been 
altogethergood,altogetherwiseifhehad 
excludedit.

‘The 
way 
to 
evince 
the 
greatest 
hatred 
for 
vice 
is 
not 
indeed 
to 
allowit 
to 
prevailfor 
a 
long 
timeandthen 
chastise 
it,but 
tocrush 
it 
beforeits 
birth, 
that 
is, 
prevent 
it 
from 
showing 
itself 
anywhere. 
A 
king, 
for 
example, 
who 
put 
his 
finances 
in 
such 
good 
order 
that 
no 
malversation 
was 
ever 
committed, 
would 
thus 
display 
more 
hatred 
for 
the 
wrong 
done 
by 
factionaries 
than 
if, 
after 
having 
suffered 
them 
to 
batten 
on 
the 
blood 
of 
the 
people, 
hehad 
them 
hanged.’ 
It 
is 
always 
the 
same 
song, 
it 
is 
anthropomorphism 
pure 
and 
simple. 
A 
king 
should 
generally 
have 
nothing 
so 
much 
at 
heart 
as 
to 
keep 
his 
subjects 



free 
from 
oppression. 
One 
of 
his 
greatest 
interests 
is 
to 
bring 
good 
order 
into 
his 
finances. 
Nevertheless 
there 
are 
times 
when 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
tolerate 
vice 
and 
disorders. 
He 
has 
a 
great 
war 
on 
his 
hands, 
he 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
exhaustion, 
he 
has 
no 
choice 
of 
generals, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
humour 
those 
he 
has, 
those 
possessed 
of 
great 
authority 
with 
the 
soldiers: 
a 
Braccio, 
a 
Sforza, 
a 
Wallenstein. 
He 
lacks 
money 
for 
the 
most 
pressing 
needs, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
turn 
to 
great 
financiers, 
who 
have 
an 
established 
credit, 
and 
he 
must 
at 
the 
same 
time 
connive 
at 
their 
malversations. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
this 
unfortunate 
necessity 
arises 
most 
often 
from 
previous 
errors. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
God: 
he 
has 
need 
of 
no 
man, 
he 
commits 
no 
error, 
he 
always 
does 
the 
best. 
One 
cannot 
even 
wish 
that 
things 
may 
go 
better, 
when 
one 
understands 
them: 
and 
it 
would 
be 
a 
vice 
in 
the 
Author 
of 
things 
if 
he 
wished 
to 
change 
anything 
whatsoever 
in 
them, 
if 
he 
wished 
to 
exclude 
the 
vice 
that 
was 
found 
there.

as

where

even

comparable 
with 
theState 
ofaprincewhoseaffairs

and

Or 
with 
that 
of 
a 
prince 
who 
encourages 
oppression 
in 
order 
to 
punish 
it, 
and 
who 
delights 
to 
see 
the 
little 
men 
with 
begging 
bowls 
and 
the 
great 
on 
scaffolds?

XI. 
‘A 
ruler 
devoted 
to 
the 
interests 
of 
virtue, 
and 
to 
the 
good 
of 
his 
subjects, 
takes 
the 
utmost 
care 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
never 
disobey 
his 
laws; 
and 
if 
he 
must 
needs 
chastise 
them 
for 
their 
disobedience, 
he 
sees 
to 
it 
that 
the 
penaltycuresthemoftheinclinationtoevil,and 
restores

and

good: 
so 
far 
is 
he 
from 
any 
desire 
that 
the 
penaltyfortheerrorshouldincline 
themmore 
andmoretowardsevil.’ 
To 
make 
men 
better, 
God 
does 
all 
that 
is 
due, 
and 
even 
all 
that 
can 
be 
done 
on 
his 
side 
without 
detriment 
to 
what 
is 
due. 
The 
most 
usual 
aim 
of 



punishment 
is 
amendment; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
sole 
aim, 
nor 
that 
which 
God 
always 
intends. 
I 
have 
said 
a 
word 
on 
that 
above. 
Original 
sin, 
which 
disposes 
men 
towards 
evil, 
is 
not 
merely 
a 
penalty 
for 
the 
first 
sin; 
it 
is 
a 
natural 
consequence 
thereof. 
On 
that 
too 
a 
word 
has 
been 
said, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
an 
observationon 
the 
fourth 
theological 
proposition. 
It 
islike 
drunkenness, 
which 
is 
a 
penalty 
for 
excess 
in 
drinking 
and 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
natural 
consequencethateasilyleadstonewsins.

‘To 
permit 
the 
evil 
that 
one 
could 
prevent 
is 
not 
to 
care 
whether 
it 
becommittedor 
not,oris 
eventowish 
thatitbecommitted.’ 
By 
no 
means. 
How 
many 
times 
do 
men 
permit 
evils 
which 
they 
could 
prevent 
if 
they 
turned 
all 
their 
efforts 
in 
that 
direction? 
But 
other 
more 
important 
cares 
prevent 
them 
from 
doing 
so. 
One 
will 
rarely 
resolve 
upon 
adjusting 
irregularities 
in 
the 
coinage 
while 
one 
is 
involved 
in 
a 
great 
war. 
And 
the 
action 
of 
an 
English 
Parliament 
in 
this 
direction 
a 
little 
before 
the 
Peace 
of 
Ryswyck 
will 
be 
rather 
praised 
than 
imitated. 
Can 
one 
conclude 
from 
this 
that 
the 
State 
has 
no 
anxiety 
about 
this 
irregularity, 
or 
even 
that 
it 
desires 
it? 
God 
has 
a 
far 
stronger 
reason, 
and 
one 
far 
more 
worthy 
of 
him, 
for 
tolerating 
evils. 
Not 
only 
does 
he 
derive 
from 
them 
greater 
goods, 
but 
he 
finds 
them 
connected 
with 
the 
greatest 
goods 
of 
all 
those 
that 
are 
possible: 
so 
that 
itwouldbeafaultnottopermit 
them.

‘It 
is 
a 
very 
great 
fault

there 
bedisorder 
intheirStates 
ornot. 
Thefaultisstillgreaterif 
they 
wish 
and 
even 
desire 
disorder

If 
by 
hidden 
and 
indirect, 
but 
infallible, 
ways 
they 
stirred 
up 
a 
sedition 
in 
their 
States 
to 
bring 
them 
to 
the 
brink 
of 
ruin, 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
for 
themselves 
the 
glory 
of 
showing 
that 
they 
have 
the 
courage 
and 
the 
prudence 
necessary 
for 
saving 
a 
great 
kingdom 
on 
the 
point 
of 
perishing, 
they 
would 
be 
most 
deserving 
of 
condemnation. 
But 
if 
they 
stirred 
up 
this 
sedition 
because 
there 
were 
no 
other 
means 
than 
that, 
of 

averting 
the 
total 
ruin 
of 
their 
subjects 
and 
of 
strengthening 
on 
new 
foundations, 
and 
for 
several 
centuries, 
the 
happiness 
of 
nations, 
one 
must 
needs 
lament 
the 
unfortunate 
necessity 
(see 
above, 
p, 
147, 
what 
has 
been 
said 
ofthe 
forceofnecessity)towhichtheywerereduced,andpraisethemforthe 
usethattheymade 
thereof.’ 


This 
maxim, 
with 
divers 
others 
set 
forth 
here, 
is 
not 
applicable 
to 
the 
government 
of 
God. 
Not 
to 
mention 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
only 
the 
disorders 
of 
a 
very 
small 
part 
of 
his 
kingdom 
which 
are 
brought 
up 
in 
objection, 
it 
is 
untrue 
that 
he 
has 
no 
anxiety 
about 
evils, 
that 
he 
desires 
them, 
that 
he 
brings 
them 
into 
being, 
to 
have 
the 
glory 
of 
allaying 
them. 
God 
wills 
order 
and 
good; 
but 
it 
happens 
sometimes 
that 
what 
is 
disorder 
in 
the 
part 
is 
order 
in 
the 
whole. 
I 
have 
already 
stated 
this 
legal 
axiom: 
Incivile 
est 
nisi 
tota 
lege 
inspecta 
judicare. 
The 
permission 
of 
evils 
comes 
from 
a 
kind 
of 
moral 
necessity: 
God 
is 
constrained 
to 
this 
by 
his 
wisdom 
and 
by 
his 
goodness; 
this 
necessity 
is 
happy, 
whereas 
that 
of 
the 
prince 
spoken 
of 
in 
the 
maxim 
is 
unhappy. 
His 
State 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
corrupt; 
and 
the 
government 
of 
God 
is 
the 
best 
State 
possible. 


129. 
XIV. 
‘The 
permission 
of 
a 
certain 
evil 
is 
only 
excusable 
when 
one 
cannot 
remedy 
it 
without 
introducing 
a 
greater 
evil; 
but 
it 
cannot 
be 
excusable 
in 
those 
who 
have 
in 
hand 
a 
remedy 
more 
efficacious 
against 
this 
evil, 
and 
against 
all 
the 
other 
evils 
that 
could 
spring 
from 
the 
suppression 
of 
this 
one.’ 
The 
maxim 
is 
true, 
but 
it 
cannot 
be 
brought 
forward 
against 
the 
government 
of 
God. 
Supreme 
reason 
constrains 
him 
to 
permit 
the 
evil. 
If 
God 
chose 
what 
would 
not 
be 
the 
best 
absolutely 
and 
in 
all, 
that 
would 
be 
a 
greater 
evil 
than 
all 
the 
individual 
evils 
which 
he 
could 
prevent 
by 
this 
means. 
Thiswrong 
choicewould 
destroy 
hiswisdomandhis 
goodness.

‘The 
Being 
infinitely 
powerful, 
Creator 
of 
matter 
and 
of 
spirits, 
makes 
whatever 
he 
wills 
of 
this 
matter 
and 
these 
spirits. 
There 
is 
no 
situation 
or 
shape 
that 
he 
cannot 
communicate 
to 
spirits. 
If 
he 
then 
permitted 
a 
physical 
or 
a 
moral 
evil, 
this 
would 
not 
be 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
otherwise 
some 
other 
still 
greater 
physical 
or 
moral 
evil 
would 
be 
altogether 
inevitable. 
None 
of 
those 
reasons 
for 
the 
mixture 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
which 
are 
founded 
on 
the 
limitationoftheforces 
ofbenefactorscanapply 
tohim.’ 
It 
is 
true 
that 
God 
makes 
of 
matter 
and 
of 
spirits 
whatever 
he 
wills; 
but 
he 
is 
like 
a 
good 
sculptor, 
who 
will 
make 
from 
his 
block 
of 
marble 
only 
that 
which 
hejudgestobethebest, 
andwhojudgeswell. 
Godmakesofmatter 
the 
most 
excellent 
of 
all 
possible 
machines; 
he 
makes 
of 
spirits 
the 
most 
excellent 
of 
all 
governments 
conceivable; 
and 
over 
and 
above 
all 
that, 
he 
establishes 
for 
their 
union 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
all 
harmonies, 
according 
to 
the 
system 
I 
have 
proposed. 
Now 
since 
physical 
evil 
and 
moral 
evil 
occur 
in 
this 
perfect 
work, 
one 
must 
conclude 
(contrary 
to 
M. 
Bayle’s 
assurance 
here) 
that 
otherwise 
a 
still 
greater 
evil 
would 
have 
been 
altogether 
inevitable. 
This 
great 
evil 
would 
be 
that 
God 
would 
have 
chosen 
ill 
if 
he 
had 
chosen 
otherwisethanhe 
has 
chosen. 
Itis 
true 
that 
God 
is 
infinitely 
powerful; 
buthis 
power 
is 
indeterminate, 
goodness 
and 
wisdom 
combined 
determine 
him 
to 
produce 
the 
best. 
M. 
Bayle 
makes 
elsewhere 
an 
objection 
which 
is 
peculiar 
to 
him, 
which 
he 
derives 
from 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
modern 
Cartesians. 
They 
say 
that 
God 
could 
have 
given 
to 
souls 
what 
thoughts 
he 
would, 
without 
making 
them 
depend 
upon 
any 
relation 
to 
the 
body: 
by 
this 
means 
souls 
would 
be 
spared 
a 
great 
number 
of 
evils 
which 
only 
spring 
from 
derangement 
of 
the 
body. 
More 
will 
be 
said 
of 
this 
later; 
now 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
God 
cannot 
establish 
a 
system 
ill-connected 
and 
full 
of 
dissonances.

represent 
a

it 
would

even 
more 
than

And 
it 
would

‘It 
is 
all 
the 
same 
whether 
one 
employ 
a 
necessary 
cause, 
or 
employ 
a 
free 
cause 
while 
choosing 
the 
moments 
when 
one 
knows 
it 
to 
be 
determined. 
If 
I 
imagine 
that 
gunpowder 
has 
the 
power 
to 
ignite 
or 
not 
to 
ignite 
when 
fire 
touches 
it, 
and 
if 
I 
know 
for 
certain 
that 
it 
will 
be 
disposed 
to 
ignite 
at 
eight 
o’clock 
in 
the 
morning, 
I 
shall 
be 
just 
as 
much 
the 
cause 
of 
its 
effects 
if 
I 
apply 
the 
fire 
to 
it 
at 
that 
hour, 
as 
I 
should 
be 
in 
assuming, 
as 
is 
the 
case, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
necessary 
cause. 
For 
where 
I 
am 
concerned 
it 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
a 
free 
cause. 
I 
should 
be 
catching 
it 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
I 
knew 
it 
to 
be 
necessitated 
by 
its 
own 
choice. 
It 
is 
impossible 
for 
a 
being 
to 
be 
free 
or 
indifferent 
with 
regard 
to 
that 
to 
which 
it 
is 
already 
determined, 
and 
at 
the 
time 
when 
it 
is 
determined 
thereto. 
All 
that

exists

The

have 
adopted 
this

of 
Aristotle. 
Scotus 
and 
sundry 
other 
Schoolmen 
appear 
to 
reject 
it, 
but 
fundamentally 
their 
distinctions 
come 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 
See 
the 
Jesuits 
of 
Coimbraon 
thispassagefromAristotle, 
et 
seq.)’ 


This 
maxim 
may 
pass 
also; 
I 
would 
wish 
only 
to 
change 
something 
in 
the 
phraseology. 
I 
would 
not 
take 
‘free’ 
and 
‘indifferent’ 
for 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing, 
and 
would 
not 
place 
‘free’ 
and 
‘determined’ 
in 
antithesis. 
One 
is 
never 
altogether 
indifferent 
with 
an 
indifference 
of 
equipoise; 
one 
is 
always 
more 
inclined 
and 
consequently 
more 
determined 
on 
one 
side 
than 
on 
another: 
but 
one 
is 
never 
necessitated 
to 
the 
choice 
that 
one 
makes. 
I 
mean 
here 
a 
necessity 
absolute 
and 
metaphysical; 
for 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
God, 
that 
wisdom, 
is 
prompted 
to 
the 
best 
by 
a 
moral 
necessity. 
It 
must 
be 
admitted 
also 
that 
one 
is 
necessitated 
to 
the 
choice 
by 
a 
hypothetical 
necessity, 
when 
one 
actually 
makes 
the 
choice; 
and 
even 
before 
one 
is 
necessitated 
thereto 
by 
the 
very 
truth 
of 
the 
futurition, 
since 
one 
will 
do 
it.

hypothetical 
necessities

‘When 
a 
whole 
great 
people 
has 
become 
guilty 
of 
rebellion, 
it 
is 
not 
showing 
clemency 
to 
pardon 
the 
hundred 
thousandth 
part, 
and 
to 
kill 
alltherest,notexcepting 
evenbabes 
andsucklings.’ 
It 
seems 
to 
be 
assumed 
here 
that 
there 
are 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
times 
more 
damned 
than 
saved, 
and 
that 
children 
dying 
unbaptized 
are 
included 
among 
the 
former. 
Both 
these 
points 
are 
disputed, 
and 
especially 
the 
damnation 
of 
these 
children. 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
this 
above. 
M. 
Bayle 
urges 
the 
same 
objection 
elsewhere 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
III, 
ch. 
178, 
): 
‘We 
see 
clearly’, 
he 
says, 
‘that 
the 
Sovereign 
who 
wishes 
to 
exercise 
both 
justice 
and 
clemency 
when 
a 
city 
has 
revolted 
must 
be 
content 
with 
the 
punishment 
of 
a 
small 
number 
of 
mutineers, 
and 
pardon 
all 
the 
rest. 
For 
if 
the 
number 
of 
those 
who 
are 
chastised 
is 
as 
a 
thousand 
to 
one, 
in 
comparison 
with 
those 
whom 
he 
freely 
pardons, 
he 
cannot 
be 
accounted 
mild, 
but, 
on 
the 



contrary, 
cruel. 
He 
would 
assuredly 
be 
accounted 
an 
abominable 
tyrant 
if 
he 
chose 
punishments 
of 
long 
duration, 
and 
if 
he 
eschewed 
bloodshed 
only 
because 
he 
was 
convinced 
that 
men 
would 
prefer 
death 
to 
a 
miserable 
life; 
and 
if, 
finally, 
the 
desire 
to 
take 
revenge 
were 
more 
responsible 
for 
his 
severities 
than 
the 
desire 
to 
turn 
to 
the 
service 
of 
the 
common 
weal 
the 
penalty 
that 
he 
would 
inflict 
on 
almost 
all 
the 
rebels. 
Criminals 
who 
are 
executed 
are 
considered 
to 
expiate 
their 
crimes 
so 
completely 
by 
the 
loss 
of 
their 
life, 
that 
the 
public 
requires 
nothing 
more, 
and 
is 
indignant 
when 
executioners 
are 
clumsy. 
These 
would 
be 
stoned 
if 
they 
were 
known 
deliberately 
to 
give 
repeated 
strokes 
of 
the 
axe; 
and 
the 
judges 
who 
are 
present 
at 
the 
execution 
would 
not 
be 
immune 
from 
danger 
if 
they 
were 
thought 
to 
take 
pleasure 
in 
this 
evil 
sport 
of 
the 
executioners, 
and 
to 
have 
surreptitiously 
urged 
them 
to 
practise 
it.’ 
(Note 
that 
this 
is 
not 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
strictly 
universal. 
There 
are 
cases 
where 
the 
people 
approve 
of 
the 
slow 
killing 
of 
certain 
criminals, 
as 
when 
Francis 
I 
thus 
put 
to 
death 
some 
persons 
accused 
of 
heresy 
after 
the 
notorious 
Placards 
of 
1534. 
No 
pity 
was 
shown 
to 
Ravaillac, 
who 
was 
tortured 
in 
divers 
horrible 
ways. 
See 
the 
French 
Mercury, 
vol. 
I, 
fol. 
m. 
455 
et 
seq. 
See 
also 
Pierre 
Matthieu 
in 
his 
History 
of 
the 
Death 
of 
Henry 
IV; 
and 
do 
not 
forget 
what 
he 
says 
on 
page 
m. 
99 
concerning 
the 
discussion 
by 
the 
judges 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
torture 
of 
this 
parricide.) 
‘Finally 
it 
is 
an 
exceptionally 
notorious 
fact 
that 
Rulers 
who 
should 
be 
guided 
by 
St. 
Paul, 
I 
mean 
who 
should 
condemn 
to 
the 
extreme 
penalty 
all 
those 
whom 
he 
condemns 
to 
eternal 
death, 
would 
be 
accounted 
enemies 
of 
the 
human 
kind 
and 
destroyers 
of 
their 
communities. 
It 
is 
incontestable 
that 
their 
laws, 
far 
from 
being 
fitted, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
legislators, 
to 
uphold 
society, 
would 
be 
its 
complete 
ruin. 
(Apply 
here 
these 
words 
of 
Pliny 
the 
Younger, 
Epist. 
22, 
lib. 
8: 
Mandemus 
memoriae 
quod 
vir 
mitissimus, 
et 
ob 
hoc 
quoque 
maximus, 
Thrasea 
crebro 
dicere 



solebat, 
Qui 
vitia 
odit, 
homines 
odit.)’ 
He 
adds 
that 
it 
was 
said 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
Draco, 
an 
Athenian 
lawgiver, 
that 
they 
had 
not 
been 
written 
with 
ink, 
but 
with 
blood, 
because 
they 
punished 
all 
sins 
with 
the 
extreme 
penalty, 
and 
because 
damnation 
is 
a 
penalty 
even 
worse 
than 
death. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
damnation 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
sin. 
Thus 
I 
once 
answered 
a 
friend, 
who 
raised 
as 
an 
objection 
the 
disproportion 
existing 
between 
an 
eternal 
punishment 
and 
a 
limited 
crime, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
injustice 
when 
the 
continuationofthepunishmentisonlyaresultofthecontinuationofthesin. 
I 
will 
speak 
further 
on 
this 
point 
later. 
As 
for 
the 
number 
of 
the 
damned, 
even 
though 
it 
should 
be 
incomparably 
greater 
among 
men 
than 
the 
number 
of 
the 
saved, 
that 
would 
not 
preclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
in 
the 
universe 
the 
happy 
creatures 
infinitely 
outnumber 
those 
who 
are 
unhappy. 
Such 
examples 
as 
that 
of 
a 
prince 
who 
punishes 
only 
the 
leaders 
of 
rebels 
or 
of 
a 
general 
who 
has 
a 
regiment 
decimated, 
are 
of 
no 
importance 
here. 
Self-interest 
compels 
the 
prince 
and 
the 
general 
to 
pardon 
the 
guilty, 
even 
though 
they 
should 
remain 
wicked. 
God 
only 
pardons 
those 
who 
become 
better: 
he 
can 
distinguish 
them; 
and 
this 
severity 
is 
more 
consistent 
with 
perfect 
justice. 
But 
if 
anyone 
asks 
why 
God 
gives 
not 
to 
all 
the 
grace 
of 
conversion, 
the 
question 
is 
of 
a 
different 
nature, 
having 
no 
relation 
to 
the 
present 
maxim. 
I 
have 
already 
answered 
it 
in 
a 
sense, 
not 
in 
order 
to 
find 
God’s 
reasons, 
but 
to 
show 
that 
he 
cannot 
lack 
such, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
no 
opposing 
reasons 
of 
any 
validity. 
Moreover, 
we 
know 
that 
sometimes 
whole 
cities 
are 
destroyed 
and 
the 
inhabitants 
put 
to 
the 
sword, 
to 
inspire 
terror 
in 
the 
rest. 
That 
may 
serve 
to 
shorten 
a 
great 
war 
or 
a 
rebellion, 
and 
would 
mean 
a 
saving 
of 
blood 
through 
the 
shedding 
of 
it: 
there 
is 
no 
decimation 
there. 
We 
cannot 
assert, 
indeed, 
that 
the 
wicked 
of 
our 
globe 
are 
punished 
so 
severely 
in 
order 
to 
intimidate 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
other 
globes 
and 
to 
make 
them 
better. 
Yet 
an 
abundance 
of 
reasons 
in 
the 
universal 
harmony 
which 
are 
unknown 
to 
us, 
because 
we 
know 



not 
sufficiently 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
city 
of 
God, 
nor 
the 
form 
of 
the 
general 
republic 
of 
spirits, 
nor 
even 
the 
whole 
architecture 
of 
bodies, 
may 
produce 
thesameeffect.

If, 
moreover,

would 
augment

sickness 
to 
the 
point 
of

one 
could 
not 
help 
saying 
that, 
despite 
all 
their 
exhortations, 
theymust

God 
wishes 
to 
save 
all 
men: 
that 
means 
that 
he 
would 
save 
them 
if 
men 
themselves 
did 
not 
prevent 
it, 
and 
did 
not 
refuse 
to 
receive 
his 
grace; 
and 
he 
is 
not 
bound 
or 
prompted 
by 
reason 
always 
to 
overcome 
their 
evil 
will. 
He 
does 
so 
sometimes 
nevertheless, 
when 
superior 
reasons 
allow 
of 
it, 
and 
when 
his 
consequent 
and 
decretory 
will, 
which 
results 
from 
all 
his 
reasons, 
makes 
him 
resolve 
upon 
the 
election 
of 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
men. 
He 
gives 
aids 
to 
all 
for 
their 
conversion 
and 
for 
perseverance, 
and 
these 
aids 
suffice 
in 
those 
who 
have 
good 
will, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
always 
suffice 
to 
give 
good 
will. 
Men 
obtain 
this 
good 
will 
either 
through 
particular 
aids 
or 
through 
circumstances 
which 
cause 
the 
success 
of 
the 
general 
aids. 
God 
cannot 
refrain 
from 
offering 
other 
remedies 
which 
he 
knows 
men 
will 
reject, 
bringing 
upon 
themselves 
all 
the 
greater 
guilt: 
but 
shall 
one 
wish 
that 
God 
be 
unjust 
in 
order 
that 
man 
may 
be 
less 
criminal? 
Moreover, 
the 
grace 
that 
does 
not 
serve 
the 
one 
may 
serve 
the 
other, 
and 
indeed 
always 
serves 
the 
totality 
of 
God’s 
plan, 
which 
is 
the 
best 
possible 
in 
conception. 
Shall 
God 
not 
give 
the 
rain, 
because 
there 
are 
low



lying 
places 
which 
will 
be 
thereby 
incommoded? 
Shall 
the 
sun 
not 
shine 
as 
much 
as 
it 
should 
for 
the 
world 
in 
general, 
because 
there 
are 
places 
which 
will 
be 
too 
much 
dried 
up 
in 
consequence? 
In 
short, 
all 
these 
comparisons, 
spoken 
of 
in 
these 
maxims 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
has 
just 
given, 
of 
a 
physician, 
a 
benefactor, 
a 
minister 
of 
State, 
a 
prince, 
are 
exceedingly 
lame, 
because 
it 
is 
well 
known 
what 
their 
duties 
are 
and 
what 
can 
and 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
object 
of 
their 
cares: 
they 
have 
scarce 
more 
than 
the 
one 
affair, 
and 
they 
often 
fail 
therein 
through 
negligence 
or 
malice. 
God’s 
object 
has 
in 
it 
something 
infinite, 
his 
cares 
embrace 
the 
universe: 
what 
we 
know 
thereof 
is 
almost 
nothing, 
and 
we 
desire 
to 
gauge 
his 
wisdom 
and 
his 
goodness 
by 
our 
knowledge. 
What 
temerity, 
or 
rather 
what 
absurdity! 
The 
objections 
are 
on 
false 
assumptions; 
it 
is 
senseless 
to 
pass 
judgement 
on 
the 
point 
of 
law 
when 
one 
does 
not 
know 
the 
matter 
of 
fact. 
To 
say 
with 
St. 
Paul, 
O 
altitudo 
divitiarum 
et 
sapientiae, 
is 
not 
renouncing 
reason, 
it 
is 
rather 
employing 
the 
reasons 
that 
we 
know, 
for 
they 
teach 
us 
that 
immensity 
of 
God 
whereof 
the 
Apostle 
speaks. 
But 
therein 
we 
confess 
our 
ignorance 
of 
the 
facts, 
and 
we 
acknowledge, 
moreover, 
before 
we 
see 
it, 
that 
God 
does 
all 
the 
best 
possible, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
infinite 
wisdom 
which 
guides 
his 
actions. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
have 
already 
before 
our 
eyes 
proofs 
and 
tests 
of 
this, 
when 
we 
see 
something 
entire, 
some 
whole 
complete 
in 
itself, 
and 
isolated, 
so 
to 
speak, 
among 
the 
works 
of 
God. 
Such 
a 
whole, 
shaped 
as 
it 
were 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
God, 
is 
a 
plant, 
an 
animal, 
a 
man. 
We 
cannot 
wonder 
enough 
at 
the 
beauty 
and 
the 
contrivance 
of 
its 
structure. 
But 
when 
we 
see 
some 
broken 
bone, 
some 
piece 
of 
animal’s 
flesh, 
some 
sprig 
of 
a 
plant, 
there 
appears 
to 
be 
nothing 
but 
confusion, 
unless 
an 
excellent 
anatomist 
observe 
it: 
and 
even 
he 
would 
recognize 
nothing 
therein 
if 
he 
had 
notbefore 
seen 
like 
pieces 
attached 
to 
their 
whole. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
the 
government 
of 
God: 
that 
which 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
see 
hitherto 
is 
not 
a 
large 
enough 
piece 
for 
recognition 
of 



the 
beauty 
and 
the 
order 
of 
the 
whole. 
Thus 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
things 
implies 
that 
this 
order 
in 
the 
Divine 
City, 
which 
we 
see 
not 
yet 
here 
on 
earth, 
should 
be 
an 
object 
of 
our 
faith, 
of 
our 
hope, 
of 
our 
confidence 
in 
God. 
If 
there 
are 
any 
who 
think 
otherwise, 
so 
much 
the 
worse 
for 
them, 
they 
are 
malcontents 
in 
the 
State 
of 
the 
greatest 
and 
the 
best 
of 
all 
monarchs; 
and 
they 
are 
wrong 
not 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
examples 
he 
has 
given 
them 
of 
his 
wisdom 
and 
his 
infinite 
goodness, 
whereby 
he 
reveals 
himself 
as 
being 
not 
only 
wonderful,butalso 
worthyoflove 
beyond 
allthings. 


135. 
I 
hope 
it 
will 
be 
found 
that 
nothing 
of 
what 
is 
comprised 
in 
the 
nineteen 
maxims 
of 
M. 
Bayle, 
which 
we 
have 
just 
considered, 
has 
been 
left 
without 
a 
necessary 
answer. 
It 
is 
likely 
that, 
having 
often 
before 
meditated 
on 
this 
subject, 
he 
will 
have 
put 
there 
all 
his 
strongest 
convictions 
touching 
the 
moral 
cause 
of 
moral 
evil. 
There 
are, 
however, 
still 
sundry 
passages 
here 
and 
there 
in 
his 
works 
which 
it 
will 
be 
well 
not 
to 
pass 
over 
in 
silence. 
Very 
often 
he 
exaggerates 
the 
difficulty 
which 
he 
assumes 
with 
regard 
to 
freeing 
God 
from 
the 
imputation 
of 
sin. 
He 
observes 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
ch. 
161, 
) 
that 
Molina, 
if 
he 
reconciled 
free 
will 
with 
foreknowledge, 
did 
not 
reconcile 
the 
goodness 
and 
the 
holiness 
of 
God 
with 
sin. 
He 
praises 
the 
sincerity 
of 
those 
who 
bluntly 
declare 
(as 
he 
claims 
Piscator 
did) 
that 
everything 
is 
to 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
and 
who 
maintain 
that 
God 
could 
not 
but 
be 
just, 
even 
though 
he 
were 
the 
author 
of 
sin, 
even 
though 
he 
condemned 
innocence. 
And 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
or 
in 
other 
passages, 
he 
seems 
to 
show 
more 
approval 
of 
the 
opinions 
of 
those 
who 
preserve 
God’s 
goodness 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
his 
greatness, 
as 
Plutarch 
does 
in 
his 
book 
against 
the 
Stoics. 
‘It 
was 
more 
reasonable’, 
he 
says, 
‘to 
say’ 
(with 
the 
Epicureans) 
‘that 
innumerable 
parts’ 
(or 
atoms 
flying 
about 
at 
haphazard 
through 
an 
infinite 
space) 
‘by 
their 
force 
prevailed 
over 
the 
weakness 
of 
Jupiter 
and, 
in 
spite 
of 
him 
and 
against 
his 
nature 
and 
will, 
did 
many 
bad 
and 

irrational 
things, 
than 
to 
agree 
that 
there 
is 
neither 
confusion 
nor 
wickedness 
but 
he 
is 
the 
author 
thereof.’ 
What 
may 
be 
said 
for 
both 
these 
parties, 
Stoics 
and 
Epicureans, 
appears 
to 
have 
led 
M. 
Bayle 
to 
the 
επεχειν 
of 
the 
Pyrrhonians, 
the 
suspension 
of 
his 
judgement 
in 
respect 
of 
reason, 
so 
long 
as 
faithis 
setapart;andtothatheprofesses 
sincere 
submission. 


136. 
Pursuing 
his 
arguments, 
however, 
he 
has 
gone 
as 
far 
as 
attempting 
almost 
to 
revive 
and 
reinforce 
those 
of 
the 
disciples 
of 
Manes, 
a 
Persian 
heretic 
of 
the 
third 
century 
after 
Christ, 
or 
of 
a 
certain 
Paul, 
chief 
of 
the 
Manichaeans 
in 
Armenia 
in 
the 
seventh 
century, 
from 
whom 
they 
were 
named 
Paulicians. 
All 
these 
heretics 
renewed 
what 
an 
ancient 
philosopher 
of 
Upper 
Asia, 
known 
under 
the 
name 
of 
Zoroaster, 
had 
taught, 
so 
it 
is 
said, 
of 
two 
intelligent 
principles 
of 
all 
things, 
the 
one 
good, 
the 
other 
bad, 
a 
dogma 
that 
had 
perhaps 
come 
from 
the 
Indians. 
Among 
them 
numbers 
of 
people 
still 
cling 
to 
their 
error, 
one 
that 
is 
exceedingly 
prone 
to 
overtake 
human 
ignorance 
and 
superstition, 
since 
very 
many 
barbarous 
peoples, 
even 
in 
America, 
have 
been 
deluded 
by 
it, 
without 
having 
had 
need 
of 
philosophy. 
The 
Slavs 
(according 
to 
Helmold) 
had 
their 
Zernebog 
or 
black 
God. 
The 
Greeks 
and 
Romans, 
wise 
as 
they 
seem 
to 
be, 
had 
a 
Vejovis 
or 
Anti-Jupiter, 
otherwise 
called 
Pluto, 
and 
numerous 
other 
maleficent 
divinities. 
The 
Goddess 
Nemesis 
took 
pleasure 
in 
abasing 
those 
who 
were 
too 
fortunate; 
and 
Herodotus 
in 
some 
passages 
hints 
at 
his 
belief 
that 
all 
Divinity 
is 
envious; 
which,however, 
isnotin 
harmonywiththedoctrineofthetwo 
principles. 
137. 
Plutarch, 
in 
his 
treatise 
On 
Isis 
and 
Osiris, 
knows 
of 
no 
writer 
more 
ancient 
than 
Zoroaster 
the 
magician, 
as 
he 
calls 
him, 
that 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
taught 
the 
two 
principles. 
Trogus 
or 
Justin 
makes 
him 
a 
King 
of 
the 
Bactrians, 
who 
was 
conquered 
by 
Ninus 
or 
Semiramis; 
he 
attributes 
to 
him 
the 
knowledge 
of 
astronomy 
and 
the 
invention 
of 
magic. 
But 
this 
magic 
was 
apparently 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
fire-worshippers: 
and 
it 
appears 
that 
he 
looked 

upon 
light 
and 
heat 
as 
the 
good 
principle, 
while 
he 
added 
the 
evil, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
opacity, 
darkness, 
cold. 
Pliny 
cites 
the 
testimony 
of 
a 
certain 
Hermippus, 
an 
interpreter 
of 
Zoroaster’s 
books, 
according 
to 
whom 
Zoroaster 
was 
a 
disciple 
in 
the 
art 
of 
magic 
to 
one 
named 
Azonacus; 
unless 
indeed 
this 
be 
a 
corruption 
of 
Oromases, 
of 
whom 
I 
shall 
speak 
presently, 
and 
whom 
Plato 
in 
the 
Alcibiades 
names 
as 
the 
father 
of 
Zoroaster. 
Modern 
Orientals 
give 
the 
name 
Zerdust 
to 
him 
whom 
the 
Greeks 
named 
Zoroaster; 
he 
is 
regarded 
as 
corresponding 
to 
Mercury, 
because 
with 
some 
nations 
Wednesday 
(mercredi) 
takes 
its 
name 
from 
him. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
disentangle 
the 
story 
of 
Zoroaster 
and 
know 
exactly 
when 
he 
lived. 
Suidas 
puts 
him 
five 
hundred 
years 
before 
the 
taking 
of 
Troy. 
Some 
Ancients 
cited 
by 
Pliny 
and 
Plutarch 
took 
it 
to 
be 
ten 
times 
as 
far 
back. 
But 
Xanthus 
the 
Lydian 
(in 
the 
preface 
to 
Diogenes 
Laertius) 
put 
him 
only 
six 
hundred 
years 
before 
the 
expedition 
of 
Xerxes. 
Plato 
declares 
in 
the 
same 
passage, 
as 
M. 
Bayle 
observes, 
that 
the 
magic 
of 
Zoroaster 
was 
nothing 
but 
the 
study 
of 
religion. 
Mr. 
Hyde 
in 
his 
book 
on 
the 
religion 
of 
the 
ancient 
Persians 
tries 
to 
justify 
this 
magic, 
and 
to 
clear 
it 
not 
only 
of 
the 
crime 
of 
impiety 
but 
also 
of 
idolatry. 
Fire-worship 
prevailed 
among 
the 
Persians 
and 
the 
Chaldaeans 
also; 
it 
is 
thought 
that 
Abraham 
left 
it 
when 
he 
departed 
from 
Ur 
of 
the 
Chaldees. 
Mithras 
was 
the 
sun 
and 
he 
was 
also 
the 
God 
of 
the 
Persians; 
and 
according 
to 
Ovid’s 
account 
horses 
were 
offeredinsacrifice 
tohim, 


Placat 
equo 
Persis 
radiis 
Hyperiona 
cinctum, 


Ne 
detur 
celeri 
victima 
tarda 
Deo. 


But 
Mr. 
Hyde 
believes 
that 
they 
only 
made 
use 
of 
the 
sun 
and 
fire 
in 
their 
worship 
as 
symbols 
of 
the 
Divinity. 
It 
may 
be 
necessary 
to 
distinguish, 
as 
elsewhere, 
between 
the 
Wise 
and 
the 
Multitude. 
There 
are 
in 
the 
splendid 
ruins 
of 
Persepolis 
or 
of 
Tschelminaar 
(which 
means 
forty 
columns) 
sculptured 
representations 
of 
their 
ceremonies. 
An 
ambassador 
of 
Holland 



had 
had 
them 
sketched 
at 
very 
great 
cost 
by 
a 
painter, 
who 
had 
devoted 
a 
considerable 
time 
to 
the 
task: 
but 
by 
some 
chance 
or 
other 
these 
sketches 
fell 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
well-known 
traveller, 
M. 
Chardin, 
according 
to 
what 
he 
tellsus 
himself. 
Itwouldbeapity 
ifthey

Theseruinsareoneofthe 
most

and

138. 
The 
ancient 
Greeks 
and 
the 
modern 
Orientals 
agree 
in 
saying 
that 
Zoroaster 
called 
the 
good 
God 
Oromazes, 
or 
rather 
Oromasdes, 
and 
the 
evil 
God 
Arimanius. 
WhenI 
pondered 
onthe 
fact 
that 
great 
princes 
of 
Upper 
Asia 
had 
the 
name 
of 
Hormisdas 
and 
that 
Irminius 
or 
Herminius 
was 
the 
name 
of 
a 
god 
or 
ancient 
hero 
of 
the 
Scythian 
Celts, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
Germani, 
it 
occurred 
to 
me 
that 
this 
Arimanius 
or 
Irminius 
might 
have 
been 
a 
great 
conqueror 
of 
very 
ancient 
time 
coming 
from 
the 
west, 
just 
as 
Genghis 
Khan 
and 
Tamburlaine 
were 
later, 
coming 
from 
the 
east. 
Arimanius 
would 
therefore 
have 
come 
from 
the 
north-west, 
that 
is, 
from 
Germaniaand 
Sarmatia, 
through 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
Alani 
and 
Massagetae, 
to 
raid 
the 
dominions 
of 
one 
Ormisdas, 
a 
great 
king 
in 
Upper 
Asia, 
just 
as 
other 
Scythians 
did 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Cyaxares, 
King 
of 
the 
Medes, 
according 
to 
the 
account 
given 
by 
Herodotus. 
The 
monarch 
governing 
civilized 
peoples, 
and 
working 
to 
defend 
them 
against 
the 
barbarians, 
would 
have 
gone 
down 
to 
posterity, 
amongst 
the 
same 
peoples, 
as 
the 
good 
god; 
but 
the 
chief 
of 
these 
devastators 
will 
have 
become 
the 
symbol 
of 
the 
evil 
principle: 
that 
is 
altogether 
reasonable. 
It 
appears 
from 
this 
same 
mythology 
that 
these 
two 
princes 
contended 
for 
long, 
but 
that 
neither 
of 
them 
was 
victorious. 
Thus 
they 
both 
held 
their 
own, 
just 
as 
the 
two 
principles 
shared 
the 
empire 
of 
the 
world 
according 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
attributedtoZoroaster. 

139. 
It 
remains 
to 
be 
proved 
that 
an 
ancient 
god 
or 
hero 
of 
the 
Germani 
was 
called 
Herman, 
Arimanius 
or 
Irminius. 
Tacitus 
relates 
that 
the 
three 
tribes 
which 
composed 
Germania, 
the 
Ingaevones, 
the 
Istaevones 
and 
the 
Herminones 
or 
Hermiones, 
were 
thus 
named 
from 
the 
three 
sons 
of 
Mannus. 
Whether 
that 
be 
true 
or 
not, 
he 
wished 
in 
any 
case 
to 
indicate 
that 
there 
was 
a 
hero 
named 
Herminius, 
from 
whom 
he 
was 
told 
the 
Herminones 
were 
named. 
Herminones, 
Hermenner, 
Hermunduri 
all 
mean 
the 
same, 
that 
is, 
Soldiers. 
Even 
in 
the 
Dark 
Ages 
Arimanni 
were 
viri 
militares, 
and 
there 
is 
feudum 
Arimandiae 
in 
Lombardlaw. 
140. 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere 
that 
apparently 
the 
name 
of 
one 
part 
of 
Germania 
was 
given 
to 
the 
whole, 
and 
that 
from 
these 
Herminones 
or 
Hermunduri 
all 
the 
Teutonic 
peoples 
were 
named 
Hermanni 
or 
Germani.The 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
words 
is 
only 
in 
the 
force 
of 
the 
aspiration: 
there 
is 
the 
same 
difference 
of 
initial 
letter 
between 
the 
Germani 
oftheLatins 
and 
Hermanos 
of 
the 
Spaniards, 
or 
in 
the 
Gammarus 
of 
the 
Latins 
and 
the 
Hummer 
(that 
is, 
marine 
crayfish) 
of 
the 
Low 
Germans. 
Besides 
it 
is 
very 
usual 
for 
one 
part 
of 
a 
nation 
to 
give 
the 
name 
to 
the 
whole: 
so 
all 
the 
Germani 
were 
called 
Alemanni 
by 
the 
French, 
and 
yet 
this, 
according 
to 
the 
old 
nomenclature, 
only 
applied 
to 
the 
Suabians 
and 
the 
Swiss. 
Although 
Tacitus 
did 
not 
actually 
know 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Germani, 
he 
said 
something 
which 
supports 
my 
opinion, 
when 
he 
observed 
that 
it 
was 
a 
name 
which 
inspired 
terror, 
taken 
or 
given 
ob 
metum. 
In 
fact 
it 
signifies 
a 
warrior: 
Heer, 
Hari 
is 
army, 
whence 
comes 
Hariban, 
or 
‘call 
to 
Haro’, 
that 
is, 
a 
general 
order 
to 
be 
with 
the 
army, 
since 
corrupted 
into 
Arrièreban. 
Thus 
Hariman 
or 
Ariman, 
German 
Guerre-man, 
is 
a 
soldier. 
For 
as 
Hari, 
Heer 
means 
army, 
so 
Wehr 
signifies 
arms, 
Wehren 
to 
fight, 
to 
make 
war, 
the 
word 
Guerre, 
Guerra 
coming 
doubtless 
from 
the 
same 
source. 
I 
have 
already 
spoken 
of 
the 
feudum 
Arimandiae: 
not 
only 
did 
Herminones 
or 
Germani 

signify 
the 
same, 
but 
also 
that 
ancient 
Herman, 
so-called 
son 
of 
Mannus, 
appearstohavebeen 
given 
thisnameasbeingpre-eminentlyawarrior. 


141. 
Now 
it 
is 
not 
the 
passage 
in 
Tacitus 
only 
which 
indicates 
for 
us 
this 
god 
or 
hero: 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
the 
existence 
of 
one 
of 
this 
name 
among 
these 
peoples, 
since 
Charlemagne 
found 
and 
destroyed 
near 
the 
Weser 
the 
column 
called 
Irminsäule, 
erected 
in 
honour 
of 
this 
god. 
And 
that 
combined 
with 
the 
passage 
in 
Tacitus 
leaves 
us 
with 
the 
conclusion 
that 
it 
was 
not 
that 
famous 
Arminius 
who 
was 
an 
enemy 
of 
the 
Romans, 
but 
a 
much 
greater 
and 
more 
ancient 
hero, 
that 
this 
cult 
concerned. 
Arminius 
bore 
the 
same 
name 
as 
those 
who 
are 
called 
Hermann 
to-day. 
Arminius 
was 
not 
great 
enough, 
nor 
fortunate 
enough, 
nor 
well 
enough 
known 
throughout 
Germania 
to 
attain 
to 
the 
honour 
of 
a 
public 
cult, 
even 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
remote 
tribes, 
like 
the 
Saxons, 
who 
came 
long 
after 
him 
into 
the 
country 
of 
the 
Cherusci. 
And 
our 
Arminius, 
taken 
by 
the 
Asiatics 
for 
the 
evil 
God, 
provides 
ample 
confirmation 
of 
my 
opinion. 
For 
in 
these 
matters 
conjectures 
confirm 
one 
another 
without 
any 
logical 
circle, 
when 
their 
foundations 
tend 
towards 
one 
and 
the 
same 
end. 
142. 
It 
is 
not 
beyond 
belief 
that 
the 
Hermes 
(that 
is, 
Mercury) 
of 
the 
Greeks 
is 
the 
same 
Herminius 
or 
Arimanius. 
He 
may 
have 
been 
an 
inventor 
or 
promoter 
of 
the 
arts 
and 
of 
a 
slightly 
more 
civilized 
life 
among 
his 
own 
people 
and 
in 
the 
countries 
where 
he 
held 
supremacy, 
while 
amongst 
his 
enemies 
he 
was 
looked 
upon 
as 
the 
author 
of 
confusion. 
Who 
knows 
but 
that 
he 
may 
have 
penetrated 
even 
into 
Egypt, 
like 
the 
Scythians 
who 
in 
pursuit 
of 
Sesostris 
came 
nearly 
so 
far. 
Theut, 
Menes 
and 
Hermes 
were 
known 
and 
revered 
in 
Egypt. 
They 
might 
have 
been 
Tuiscon, 
his 
son 
Mannus 
and 
Herman, 
son 
of 
Mannus, 
according 
to 
the 
genealogy 
of 
Tacitus. 
Menes 
is 
held 
to 
be 
the 
most 
ancient 
king 
of 
the 
Egyptians; 
‘Theut’ 
was 
with 
them 
a 
name 
for 
Mercury. 
At 
least 
Theut 
or 
Tuiscon, 
from 
whom 
Tacitus 
derives 
the 

descent 
of 
the 
Germani, 
and 
from 
whom 
the 
Teutons, 
Tuitsche 
(that 
is, 
Germani) 
even 
to-day 
have 
their 
name, 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
Teutates 
who 
according 
to 
Lucan 
was 
worshipped 
by 
the 
Gauls, 
and 
whom 
Caesar 
took 
pro 
Dite 
Patre, 
forPluto, 
because 
ofthe 
resemblance 
between 
his 
Latin 
name 
and 
that 
of 
Teut 
or 
Thiet, 
Titan, 
Theodon; 
this 
in 
ancient 
times 
signified 
men, 
people, 
and 
also 
an 
excellent 
man 
(like 
the 
word 
‘baron’), 
in 
short, 
a 
prince. 
There 
are 
authorities 
for 
all 
these 
significations: 
but 
one 
must 
not 
delay 
over 
this 
point. 
Herr 
Otto 
Sperling, 
who 
is 
well 
known 
for 
various 
learned 
writings, 
but 
has 
many 
more 
in 
readiness 
to 
appear, 
in 
a 
special 
dissertation 
has 
treated 
the 
question 
of 
this 
Teutates, 
God 
of 
the 
Celts. 
Some 
observations 
which 
I 
imparted 
to 
him 
on 
that 
subject 
have 
been 
published, 
with 
his 
reply, 
in 
the 
Literary 
News 
of 
the 
Baltic 
Sea. 
He 
interprets 
this 
passage 
from 
Lucan 
somewhatotherwisethanIdo: 


Teutates, 
pollensque 
feris 
altaribus 
Hesus, 


Et 
Tamaris 
Scythicae 
non 
mitior 
ara 
Dianae. 


Hesus 
was, 
itappears,theGod 
ofWar, 
whowas 
calledAresby 
theGreeks 
and 
Erich 
by 
the 
ancient 
Germani, 
whence 
still 
remains 
Erichtag, 
Tuesday. 
The 
letters 
R 
and 
S, 
which 
are 
produced 
by 
the 
same 
organ, 
are 
easily 
interchanged, 
for 
instance: 
Moor 
and 
Moos, 
Geren 
and 
Gesen, 
Er 
war 
and 
Er 
was, 
Fer, 
Hierro, 
Eiron, 
Eisen. 
Likewise 
Papisius, 
Valesius, 
Fusius, 
instead 
of 
Papirius, 
Valerius, 
Furius, 
with 
the 
ancient 
Romans. 
As 
for 
Taramis 
or 
perhaps 
Taranis, 
one 
knows 
that 
Taran 
was 
the 
thunder, 
or 
the 
God 
of 
Thunder, 
with 
the 
ancient 
Celts, 
called 
Thor 
by 
the 
Germani 
of 
the 
north; 
whence 
the 
English 
have 
preserved 
the 
name 
‘Thursday’, 
jeudi, 
diem 
Jovis. 
And 
the 
passage 
from 
Lucan 
means 
that 
the 
altar 
of 
Taran, 
God 
of 
the 
Celts, 
was 
not 
less 
cruel 
than 
that 
of 
Diana 
in 
Tauris: 
Taranis 
aram 
non 
mitiorem 
ara 
Dianae 
Scythicae 
fuisse. 



143. 
It 
is 
also 
not 
impossible 
that 
there 
was 
a 
time 
when 
the 
western 
or 
Celtic 
princes 
made 
themselves 
masters 
of 
Greece, 
of 
Egypt 
and 
a 
good 
part 
of 
Asia, 
and 
that 
their 
cult 
remained 
in 
those 
countries. 
When 
one 
considers 
with 
what 
rapidity 
the 
Huns, 
the 
Saracens 
and 
the 
Tartars 
gained 
possession 
of 
a 
great 
part 
of 
our 
continent 
one 
will 
be 
the 
less 
surprised 
at 
this; 
and 
it 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
great 
number 
of 
words 
in 
the 
Greek 
and 
German 
tongues 
which 
correspond 
so 
closely. 
Callimachus, 
in 
a 
hymn 
in 
honour 
of 
Apollo, 
seems 
to 
imply 
that 
the 
Celts 
who 
attacked 
the 
Temple 
at 
Delphi, 
under 
their 
Brennus, 
or 
chief, 
were 
descendants 
of 
the 
ancient 
Titans 
and 
Giants 
who 
made 
war 
on 
Jupiter 
and 
the 
other 
gods, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
on 
the 
Princes 
of 
Asia 
and 
of 
Greece. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
Jupiter 
is 
himself 
descended 
from 
the 
Titans 
or 
Theodons, 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
earlier 
Celto-Scythian 
princes; 
and 
the 
material 
collected 
by 
the 
late 
Abbé 
de 
la 
Charmoye 
in 
his 
Celtic 
Origins 
conforms 
to 
that 
possibility. 
Yet 
there 
are 
opinions 
on 
other 
matters 
in 
this 
work 
by 
this 
learned 
writer 
which 
to 
me 
do 
not 
appear 
probable, 
especially 
when 
he 
excludes 
the 
Germani 
from 
the 
number 
of 
the 
Celts, 
not 
having 
recalled 
sufficientlythefactsgivenbyancientwritersandnotbeingsufficientlyaware 
of 
therelation 
between 
the 
ancient 
Gallic 
and 
Germanic 
tongues. 
Now 
the 
so-
called 
Giants, 
who 
wished 
to 
scale 
the 
heavens, 
were 
new 
Celts 
who 
followed 
the 
path 
of 
their 
ancestors; 
and 
Jupiter, 
although 
of 
their 
kindred, 
as 
it 
were, 
was 
constrained 
to 
resist 
them. 
Just 
so 
did 
the 
Visigoths 
established 
in 
Gallic 
territory 
resist, 
together 
with 
the 
Romans, 
other 
peoples 
of 
Germania 
and 
Scythia, 
who 
succeeded 
them 
under 
Attila 
their 
leader, 
he 
being 
at 
that 
time 
in 
control 
of 
the 
Scythian, 
Sarmatic 
and 
Germanic 
tribes 
from 
the 
frontiers 
of 
Persia 
up 
to 
the 
Rhine. 
But 
the 
pleasure 
one 
feels 
when 
one 
thinks 
to 
find 
in 
the 
mythologies 
of 
the 
gods 
some 
trace 
of 
the 
old 
history 
of 
fabulous 
times 
has 
perhaps 
carried 
me 
too 
far, 
and 
I 
know 
not 
whether 
I 
shall 
have 
been 
any 
more 
successful 
than 
Goropius 
Becanus, 
Schrieckius, 

HerrRudbeck 
andtheAbbedelaCharmoye. 


144. 
Let 
us 
return 
to 
Zoroaster, 
who 
led 
us 
to 
Oromasdes 
and 
Arimanius, 
the 
sources 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
and 
let 
us 
assume 
that 
he 
looked 
upon 
them 
as 
two 
eternal 
principles 
opposed 
to 
each 
other, 
although 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
doubt 
this 
assumption. 
It 
is 
thought 
that 
Marcion, 
disciple 
of 
Cerdon, 
was 
of 
this 
opinion 
before 
Manes. 
M. 
Bayle 
acknowledges 
that 
these 
men 
used 
lamentable 
arguments; 
but 
he 
thinks 
that 
they 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
recognize 
their 
advantages 
or 
know 
how 
to 
apply 
their 
principal 
instrument, 
which 
was 
the 
difficulty 
over 
the 
origin 
of 
evil. 
He 
believes 
that 
an 
able 
man 
on 
their 
side 
would 
have 
thoroughly 
embarrassed 
the 
orthodox, 
and 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
he 
himself, 
failing 
any 
other, 
wished 
to 
undertake 
a 
task 
so 
unnecessary 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
many 
people. 
‘All 
the 
hypotheses’ 
(he 
says, 
Dictionary, 
v. 
‘Marcion’, 
) 
‘that 
Christians 
have 
established 
parry 
but 
poorly 
the 
blows 
aimed 
at 
them: 
they 
all 
triumph 
when 
they 
act 
on 
the 
offensive; 
but 
they 
lose 
their 
whole 
advantage 
when 
they 
have 
to 
sustain 
the 
attack.’ 
He 
confesses 
that 
the 
‘Dualists’ 
(as 
with 
Mr. 
Hyde 
he 
calls 
them), 
that 
is, 
the 
champions 
of 
two 
principles, 
would 
soon 
have 
been 
routed 
by 
a 
priori 
reasons, 
taken 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
God; 
but 
he 
thinks 
that 
they 
triumph 
in 
their 
turn 
when 
one 
comes 
to 
the 
a 
posteriori 
reasons, 
which 
are 
taken 
from 
the 
existenceofevil. 
145. 
He 
treats 
of 
the 
matter 
with 
abundant 
detail 
in 
his 
Dictionary, 
article 
‘Manichaeans’,, 
which 
we 
must 
examine 
a 
little, 
in 
order 
to 
throw 
greater 
light 
upon 
this 
subject: 
‘The 
surest 
and 
clearest 
ideas 
of 
order 
teach 
us’, 
he 
says, 
‘that 
a 
Being 
who 
exists 
through 
himself, 
who 
is 
necessary, 
who 
is 
eternal, 
must 
be 
single, 
infinite, 
all 
powerful, 
and 
endowed 
with 
all 
kinds 
of 
perfections.’ 
This 
argument 
deserves 
to 
have 
been 
developed 
more 
completely. 
‘Now 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
see’, 
he 
goes 
on, 
‘if 
the 
phenomena 
of 
nature 
can 
be 
conveniently 
explained 
by 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
one 
single 

principle.’ 
I 
have 
explained 
it 
sufficiently 
by 
showing 
that 
there 
are 
cases 
where 
some 
disorder 
in 
the 
part 
is 
necessary 
for 
producing 
the 
greatest 
order 
in 
the 
whole. 
But 
it 
appears 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
asks 
a 
little 
too 
much: 
he 
wishes 
for 
a 
detailed 
exposition 
of 
how 
evil 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
best 
possible 
scheme 
for 
the 
universe. 
That 
would 
be 
a 
complete 
explanation 
of 
the 
phenomena: 
but 
I 
do 
not 
undertake 
to 
give 
it; 
nor 
am 
I 
bound 
to 
do 
so, 
for 
there 
is 
no 
obligation 
to 
do 
that 
which 
is 
impossible 
for 
us 
in 
our 
existing 
state. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
for 
me 
to 
point 
out 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
the 
connexionof 
acertain 
individual 
evil 
with 
whatisthe 
best 
onthe 
whole. 
This 
incomplete 
explanation, 
leaving 
something 
to 
be 
discovered 
in 
the 
life 
to 
come, 
is 
sufficient 
for 
answering 
the 
objections, 
though 
not 
for 
a 
comprehension 
ofthematter. 


146. 
‘The 
heavens 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
universe’, 
adds 
M. 
Bayle, 
‘preach 
the 
glory, 
the 
power, 
the 
oneness 
of 
God.’ 
Thence 
the 
conclusion 
should 
have 
been 
drawn 
that 
this 
is 
the 
case 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
observed 
above) 
because 
there 
is 
seen 
in 
these 
objects 
something 
entire 
and 
isolated, 
so 
to 
speak. 
Every 
time 
we 
see 
such 
a 
work 
of 
God, 
we 
find 
it 
so 
perfect 
that 
we 
must 
wonder 
at 
the 
contrivance 
and 
the 
beauty 
thereof: 
but 
when 
we 
do 
not 
see 
an 
entire 
work, 
when 
we 
only 
look 
upon 
scraps 
and 
fragments, 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
if 
the 
good 
order 
is 
not 
evident 
there. 
Our 
planetary 
system 
composes 
such 
an 
isolated 
work, 
which 
is 
complete 
also 
when 
it 
is 
taken 
by 
itself; 
each 
plant, 
each 
animal, 
each 
man 
furnishes 
one 
such 
work, 
to 
a 
certain 
point 
of 
perfection: 
one 
recognizes 
therein 
the 
wonderful 
contrivance 
of 
the 
author. 
But 
the 
human 
kind, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
known 
to 
us, 
is 
only 
a 
fragment, 
only 
a 
small 
portion 
of 
the 
City 
of 
God 
or 
of 
the 
republic 
of 
Spirits, 
which 
has 
an 
extent 
too 
great 
for 
us, 
and 
whereof 
we 
know 
too 
little, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
observe 
the 
wonderful 
order 
therein. 
‘Man 
alone,’ 
says 
M. 
Bayle, 
‘that 
masterpiece 
of 
his 
Creator 
among 
things 
visible, 
man 
alone, 
I 
say, 
gives 
rise 
to 
great 

objections 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
oneness 
of 
God.’ 
Claudian 
made 
the 
same 


observation, 
unburdeninghis 
heart 
inthesewell-knownlines: 


Saepe 
mihi 
dubiam 
traxit 
sententia 
mentem,etc. 


Butthe 
harmonyexistinginalltherestallowsof 
astrongpresumptionthat 
it 
would 
exist 
also 
in 
the 
government 
of 
men, 
and 
generally 
in 
that 
of 
Spirits, 
if 
thewholewereknown 
tous. 
Onemustjudgetheworks

aswiselyas 
Socrates 
judged 
those 
of 
Heraclitus 
in 
these 
words: 
What 
I

thereof 
pleases 
me; 
I 
think 
that 
the 
rest 
would 
please 
me 
no 
less 
if 
I 
understood 
it. 


147. 
Here 
is 
another 
particular 
reason 
for 
the 
disorder 
apparent 
in 
that 
which 
concerns 
man. 
It 
is 
that 
God, 
in 
giving 
him 
intelligence, 
has 
presented 
him 
withanimage 
oftheDivinity. 
Heleaveshimtohimself,ina

It 
is 
there 
that 
free 
will 
plays 
its 
game: 
and 
God 
makes 
game 
(so 
to 
speak)

of 
children 
who

pursuits 
which 
we 
secretly 
encourage 
or 
hinder 
according 
as 
it 
pleases 
us. 
Thus 
man 
is 
there 
like 
a 
little 
god 
in 
his 
own 
world 
or 
Microcosm, 
which 
he 
governs 
after 
his 
own 
fashion: 
he 
sometimes

But 
he 
also 
commits 
great 
errors, 
because 
he 
abandons 
himself 
to 
the 
passions, 
and 
because 
God 
abandons 
him 
to 
his 
own 
way. 
God 
punishes 
him 
also 
for 
such 
errors, 
now 
like 
a 
father 
or 
tutor, 
training 
or 
chastising 
children, 
now 
like 
a 
just 
judge, 
punishing 
those 
who 
forsake 
him: 
and 
evil 
comes 
to 
pass 
most 
frequently 
when 
these 
intelligences 
or 
their 
small 
worlds 
come 
into 
collision. 
Man 
finds 
himself 
the 
worse 
for 
this, 
in 
proportion 
to 
his 
fault; 
but 
God, 
by 
a 
wonderful 
art, 
turns 
all 
the 
errors 
of 
these 
little 
worlds 
to 
the 
greater 
adornment 
of 
his 
great 
world. 
It 
is 
as 
in 
those 
devices 
of 
perspective, 
where 
certain 
beautiful 
designs 
look 
like 
mere 
confusion 
until 
one 
restores 
them 
to 
the 
right 
angle 
of 
vision 
or 
one 
views 
them 
by 
means 
of 
a 
certain 
glass 
or 
mirror. 
It 
is 
by 
placing 
and 
using 
them 
properly 
that 
one 
makes 
them 
serve 
as 
adornment 
for 
a 
room. 
Thus 
the 
apparent 
deformities 
of 
our 
little 
worlds 
combine 
to 
become 
beauties 
in 
the 
great 
world, 
and 
have 
nothing 
in 
them 
which 
is 
opposed 
to 
the 
oneness 
of 
an 
infinitely 
perfect 
universal 
principle: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
they 
increase 
our 
wonder 
at 
the 
wisdom 
of 
him 
whomakesevil 
servethegreatergood. 


148. 
M. 
Bayle 
continues: 
‘that 
man 
is 
wicked 
and 
miserable; 
that 
there 
are 
everywhere 
prisons 
and 
hospitals; 
that 
history 
is 
simply 
a 
collection 
of 
the 
crimes 
and 
calamities 
of 
the 
human 
race.’ 
I 
think 
that 
there 
is 
exaggeration 
in 
that: 
there 
is 
incomparably 
more 
good 
thanevilinthe 
life 
ofmen,asthere 
are 
incomparably 
more 
houses 
than 
prisons. 
With 
regard 
to 
virtue 
and 
vice, 
a 
certain 
mediocrity 
prevails. 
Machiavelli 
has 
already 
observed 
that 
there 
are 
few 
very 
wicked 
and 
very 
good 
men, 
and 
that 
this 
causes 
the 
failure 
of 
many 
great 
enterprises. 
I 
find 
it 
a 
great 
fault 
in 
historians 
that 
they 
keep 
their 
mind 
ontheevilmore 
thanonthegood. 
Thechiefendofhistory,asalsoofpoetry, 
should 
be 
to 
teach 
prudence 
and 
virtue 
by 
examples, 
and 
then 
to 
display 
vice 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
create 
aversion 
to 
it 
and 
to 
prompt 
men 
to 
avoid 
it, 
or 
servetowardsthatend. 

149. 
M. 
Bayle 
avows: 
‘that 
one 
finds 
everywhere 
both 
moral 
good 
and 
physical 
good, 
some 
examples 
of 
virtue, 
some 
examples 
of 
happiness, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
what 
makes 
the 
difficulty. 
For 
if 
there 
were 
only 
wicked 
and 
unhappy 
people’, 
he 
says, 
‘there 
would 
be 
no 
need 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
two 
principles.’ 
I 
wonder 
that 
this 
admirable 
man 
could 
have 
evinced 
so 
great 
an 
inclination 
towards 
this 
opinion 
of 
the 
two 
principles; 
and 
I 
am 
surprised 
at 
his 
not 
havingtaken 
into 
accountthatthisromanceof 
human 
life, 
which 
makes 
the 
universal 
history 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
lay 
fully 
devised 
in 
the 
divine 
understanding, 
with 
innumerable 
others, 
and 
that 
the 
will 
of 
God 
only 
decreed 
its 
existence 
because 
this 
sequence 
of 
events 
was 
to 
be 
most 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
things, 
to 
bring 
forth 
the 
best 
result. 
And 
these 
apparent 
faults 
in 
the 
whole 
world, 
these 
spots 
on 
a 
Sun 
whereof 
ours 
is 
but 
a 
ray, 
rather 
enhance 
its 
beauty 
than 
diminish 
it, 
contributing 
towards 
that 
end 
by 
obtaining 
a 
greater 
good. 
There 
are 
in 
truth 
two 
principles, 
but 
they 
are 
both 
in 
God, 
to 
wit, 
his 
understanding 
and 
his 
will. 
The 
understanding 
furnishes 
the 
principle 
of 
evil, 
without 
being 
sullied 
by 
it, 
without 
being 
evil; 
it 
represents 
natures 
as 
they 
exist 
in 
the 
eternal 
verities; 
it 
contains 
within 
it 
the 
reason 
wherefore 
evil 
is 
permitted: 
but 
the 
will 
tends 
only 
towards 
good. 
Let 
us 
add 
a 
third 
principle, 
namely 
power; 
it 
precedes 
even 
understanding 
and 
will,butitoperates 
astheonedisplaysitand

150. 
Some 
(like 
Campanella) 
have 
called 
these 
three 
perfections 
of 
God 
the 
three 
primordialities. 
Many 
have 
even 
believed 
that 
there 
was 
therein 
a 
secret 
connexion 
with 
the 
Holy 
Trinity: 
that 
power 
relates 
to 
the 
Father, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
source 
of 
Divinity, 
wisdom 
to 
the 
Eternal 
Word, 
which 
is 
called 
logos 
by 
the 
most 
sublime 
of 
the 
Evangelists, 
and 
will 
or 
Love

Holy 
Spirit.

151. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
if 
M. 
Bayle 
had 
taken 
into 
account 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
things, 
he 
would 
have 
answered 
his 
own 
questions, 
or 
at 
the 
least 
he 
would 
not 
have 
continued 
to 
ask, 
as 
he 
does 
in 
thesewhichfollow: 
‘Ifmanisthework

Can 
he

many

tendencies? 
Can 
he 
commit 
so 
many 
crimes? 
Can 
supreme 
goodness 
produce 
an 
unhappy 
creature? 
Shall 
not 
supreme 
power, 
united 
to 
an 
infinite 
goodness, 
shower 
blessings 
upon 
its 
work, 
and 
shall 
it 
not 
banish 
all 
that 
might 
offend 
or 
grieve?’

But 
I 
have 
already 
answered 
that 
sufficiently. 
Man 
is 
himself 
the 
source 
of 
his 
evils: 
just 
as 
he 
is, 
he 
was 
in 
the 
divine 
idea. 
God, 
prompted 
by 
essential 
reasons 
of 
wisdom, 
decreed 
that 
he 
should 
pass 
into 
existence 
just 
as 
he 
is. 


M. 
Bayle 
would 
perchance 
have 
perceived 
this 
origin 
of 
evil 
in 
the 
form 
in 
which 
I 
demonstrate 
it 
here, 
if 
he 
had 
herein 
combined 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
with 
his 
power, 
his 
goodness 
and 
his 
holiness. 
I 
will 
add, 
in 
passing, 
that 
his 
holiness 
is 
nothing 
other 
than 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
goodness, 
just 
as 
the 
crime 
whichisitsopposite

152. 
M. 
Bayle 
places 
the 
Greek 
philosopher 
Melissus, 
champion 
of 
the 
oneness 
of 
the 
first 
principle 
(and 
perhaps 
even 
of 
the 
oneness 
of 
substance) 
in 
conflict 
with 
Zoroaster, 
as 
with 
the 
first 
originator 
of 
duality. 
Zoroaster 
admits 
that 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
Melissus 
is 
more 
consistent 
with 
order 
and 
a 
priori 
reasons, 
but 
he 
denies 
its 
conformity 
with 
experience 
and 
a 
posteriori 
reasons. 
‘I 
surpass 
you’, 
he 
said, 
‘in 
the 
explanation 
of 
phenomena, 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
mark 
of 
a 
good 
system.’ 
But, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
very 
good 
explanation 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
to 
assign 
to 
it 
an 
ad 
hoc 
principle: 
to 
evil, 
a 
principium 
maleficum, 
to 
cold, 
a 
primum 
frigidum; 
there 
is 
nothing 
so 
easy 
and 
nothing 
so 
dull. 
It 
is 
well-nigh 
as 
if 
someone 
were 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Peripatetics 
surpass 
the 
new 
mathematicians 
in 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
stars, 
by 
giving 
them 
ad 
hoc 
intelligences 
to 
guide 
them. 
According 
to 
that, 
it 
is 
quite 
easy 
to 
conceive 
why 
the 
planets 
make 
their 
way 
with 
such 
precision; 
whereas 
there 
is 
need 
of 
much 
geometry 
and 
reflexion 
to 
understand 
howfromthegravityof 
theplanets,which 
bearsthemtowardsthe

combined 
with 
some 
whirlwind 
which 
carries 
them 
along, 
or 
with 
their 
own 
motive 
force, 
can 
spring 
theelliptic 
movementof 
Kepler, 
whichsatisfies 
appearances 
so 
well. 
A 
man 
incapable 
of 
relishing 
deep 
speculations 
will 
at 
first 
applaud 
the 
Peripatetics 
and 
will 
treat 
our 
mathematicians 
as 
dreamers. 
Some 
old 
Galenist 
will 
do 
the 
same 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
faculties 
of 
the 
Schoolmen: 
he 
will 
admit 
a 
chylific, 
a 
chymific 
and 
a 
sanguific, 
and 
he 
will 
assign 
one 
of 
these 
ad 
hoc 
to 
each 
operation; 
he 
will 
think 
he 
has 
worked 
wonders, 
and 
will 
laugh 
at 
what 
he 
will 
call 
the 
chimeras 
of 
the 
moderns, 
who 
claim 
to 
explain 
through 
mechanical 
structure 
whatpassesinthe 
body 
of 
ananimal. 
153. 
The 
explanation 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
evil 
by 
a 
particular 
principle, 
per 
principium 
maleficum, 
is 
of 
the 
same 
nature. 
Evil 
needs 
no 
such 
explanation, 
any 
more 
than 
do 
cold 
and 
darkness: 
there 
is 
neither 
primum 
frigidum 
nor 

principle 
of 
darkness. 
Evil 
itself 
comes 
only 
from 
privation; 
the 
positive 
enters 
therein 
only 
by 
concomitance, 
as 
the 
active 
enters 
by 
concomitance 
into 
cold. 
We 
see 
that 
water 
in 
freezing 
is 
capable 
of 
breaking 
a 
gun-barrel 
wherein 
it 
is 
confined; 
and 
yet 
cold 
is 
a 
certain 
privation 
of 
force, 
it 
only 
comes 
from 
the 
diminution 
of 
a 
movement 
which 
separates 
the 
particles 
of 
fluids. 
When 
this 
separating 
motion 
becomes 
weakened 
in 
the 
water 
by 
the 
cold, 
the 
particles 
of 
compressed 
air 
concealed 
in 
the 
water 
collect; 
and, 
becoming 
larger, 
they 
become 
more 
capable 
of 
acting 
outwards 
through 
their 
buoyancy. 
The 
resistance 
which 
the 
surfaces 
of 
the 
proportions 
of 
air 
meet 
in 
the 
water, 
and 
which 
opposes 
the 
force 
exerted 
by 
these 
portions 
towards 
dilation, 
is 
far 
less, 
and 
consequently 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
air 
greater, 
in 
large 
air-
bubbles 
than 
in 
small, 
even 
though 
these 
small 
bubbles 
combined 
should 
form 
as 
great 
a 
mass 
as 
the 
large. 
For 
the 
resistances, 
that 
is, 
the 
surfaces, 
increase 
by 
the 
square, 
and 
the 
forces, 
that 
is, 
the 
contents 
or 
the 
volumes 
of 
the 
spheres 
of 
compressed 
air, 
increase 
by 
the 
cube, 
of 
their 
diameters. 
Thus 
it 
is 
by 
accident 
that 
privation 
involves 
action 
and 
force. 
I 
have 
already 
shown 
how 
privation 
is 
enough 
to 
cause 
error 
and 
malice, 
and 
how 
God 
is 
prompted 
to 
permit 
them, 
despite 
that 
there 
be 
no 
malignity 
in 
him. 
Evil 
comes 
from 
privation; 
the 
positive 
and 
action 
spring 
from 
it 
by 
accident, 
as 
forcespringsfromcold. 


154. 
The 
statement 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
attributes 
to 
the 
Paulicians,, 
is 
not 
conclusive, 
to 
wit, 
that 
free 
will 
must 
come 
from 
two 
principles, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
it 
may 
have 
power 
to 
turn 
towards 
good 
and 
towards 
evil: 
for, 
being 
simple 
in 
itself, 
it 
should 
rather 
have 
come 
from 
a 
neutral 
principle 
if 
this 
argument 
held 
good. 
But 
free 
will 
tends 
towards 
good, 
and 
if 
it 
meets 
with 
evil 
it 
is 
by 
accident, 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
this 
evil 
is 
concealed 
beneath 
the 
good,andmasked,asitwere. 
Thesewordswhich 
Ovid 
ascribestoMedea, 
Video 
meliora 
proboque, 



Deteriora 
sequor, 


imply 
that 
the 
morally 
good 
is 
mastered 
by 
the 
agreeably 
good, 
which 
makesmoreimpressiononsoulswhentheyare 
disturbedbythepassions. 


155. 
Furthermore, 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
supplies 
Melissus 
with 
a 
good 
answer; 
but 
a 
little 
later 
he 
disputes 
it. 
Here 
are 
his 
words,: 
‘If 
Melissus 
consults 
the 
notions 
of 
order, 
he 
will 
answer 
that 
man 
was 
not 
wicked 
when 
God 
made 
him; 
he 
will 
say 
that 
man 
received 
from 
God 
a 
happy 
state, 
but 
that 
not 
having 
followed 
the 
light 
of 
conscience, 
which 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
its 
author 
should 
have 
guided 
him 
along 
the 
path 
of 
virtue, 
he 
has 
become 
wicked, 
and 
has 
deserved 
that 
God 
the 
supremely 
good 
should 
make 
him 
feel 
the 
effects 
of 
his 
anger. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
God 
who 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
moral 
evil: 
but 
he 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
physical 
evil, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
punishment 
of 
moral 
evil. 
And 
this 
punishment, 
far 
from 
being 
incompatible 
with 
the 
supremely 
good 
principle, 
of 
necessity 
emanates 
from 
that 
one 
of 
its 
attributes, 
I 
mean 
its 
justice, 
which 
is 
not 
less 
essential 
to 
it 
than 
its 
goodness. 
This 
answer, 
the 
most 
reasonable 
that 
Melissus 
can 
give, 
is 
fundamentally 
good 
and 
sound, 
but 
it 
may 
be 
disputed 
by 
something 
more 
specious 
and 
more 
dazzling. 
For 
indeed 
Zoroaster 
objects 
that 
the 
infinitely 
good 
principle 
ought 
to 
have 
created 
man 
not 
only 
without 
actual 
evil, 
but 
also 
without 
the 
inclination 
towards 
evil; 
that 
God, 
having 
foreseen 
sin 
with 
all 
its 
consequences, 
ought 
to 
have 
prevented 
it; 
that 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
impelled 
man 
to 
moral 
good, 
and 
not 
to 
have 
allowed 
him 
any 
force 
for 
tending 
towards 
crime.’ 
That 
is 
quite 
easy 
to 
say, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
practicable 
if 
one 
follows 
the 
principles 
of 
order: 
it 
could 
not 
have 
been 
accomplished 
without 
perpetual 
miracles. 
Ignorance, 
error 
and 
malice 
follow 
one 
another 
naturally 
in 
animals 
made 
as 
we 
are: 
should 
this 
species, 
then, 
have 
been 
missing 
in 
the 
universe? 
I 
have 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
it 
is 
too 
important 
there, 
despite 
all 
its 
weaknesses, 
forGodtohaveconsentedtoits 
abolition.

M. 
Bayle, 
in 
the 
article 
entitled 
‘Paulicians’ 
inserted 
by 
him 
in 
his 
Dictionary, 
follows 
up 
the 
pronouncements 
he 
made 
in 
the 
article 
on 
the 
Manichaeans. 
According 
to 
him 
(, 
lit. 
H) 
the 
orthodox 
seem 
to 
admit 
two 
first 
principles, 
in 
making 
the 
devil 
the 
originator 
of 
sin. 
M. 
Becker, 
a 
former 
minister 
of 
Amsterdam, 
author 
of 
the 
book 
entitled 
The 
World 
Bewitched, 
has 
made 
use 
of 
this 
idea 
in 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
one 
should 
not 
assign 
such 
power 
and 
authority 
to 
the 
Devil 
as 
would 
allow 
of 
his 
comparison 
with 
God. 
Therein 
he 
is 
right: 
but 
he 
pushes 
the 
conclusions 
too 
far. 
And 
the 
author 
of 
the 
book 
entitled 
Αποκαταστασις 
Παντων 
believes 
that 
if 
the 
Devil 
had 
never 
been 
vanquished 
and 
despoiled, 
if 
he 
had 
always 
kept 
his 
prey, 
if 
the 
title 
of 
invincible 
had 
belonged 
to 
him, 
that 
would 
have 
done 
injury 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
God. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
poor 
advantage 
to 
keep 
those 
whom 
one 
has 
led 
astray 
in 
orderto 
sharetheir 
punishment 
for 
ever. 
And 
as 
for 
thecauseofevil,itistrue 
that 
the 
Devil 
is 
the 
author 
of 
sin. 
But 
the 
origin 
of 
sin 
comes 
from 
farther 
away, 
its 
source 
is 
in 
the 
original 
imperfection 
of 
creatures: 
that 
renders 
them 
capable 
of 
sinning, 
and 
there 
are 
circumstances 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
things 
which 
causethispower 
toevinceitselfinaction. 
157. 
The 
devils 
were 
angels 
like 
the 
rest 
before 
their 
fall, 
and 
it 
is 
thought 
that 
their 
leader 
was 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
among 
angels; 
but 
Scripture 
is 
not 
explicit 
enough 
on 
that 
point. 
The 
passage 
of 
the 
Apocalypse 
that 
speaks 
of 
the 
struggle 
with 
the 
Dragon, 
as 
of 
a 
vision, 
leaves 
much 
in 
doubt, 
and 
does 
not 
sufficiently 
develop 
a 
subject 
which 
by 
the 
other 
sacred 
writers 
is 
hardly 
mentioned. 
It 
is 
not 
in 
place 
here 
to 
enter 
into 
this 
discussion, 
and 
one 
must 
still 
admit 
that 
the 
common 
opinion 
agrees 
best 
with 
the 
sacred 
text. 
M. 
Bayle 
examines 
some 
replies 
of 
St. 
Basil, 
of 
Lactantius 
and 
others 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
evil. 
As, 
however, 
they 
are 
concerned 
with 
physical 
evil, 
I 
postpone 
discussion 
thereof, 
and 
I 
will 
proceed 
with 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
difficulties 

over 
the 
moral 
cause 
of 
moral 
evil, 
which 
arise 
in 
several 
passages 
of 
the 
works 
ofourgifted 
author. 


158. 
He 
disputes 
the 
permission 
of 
this 
evil, 
he 
would 
wish 
one 
to 
admit 
that 
God 
wills 
it. 
He 
quotes 
these 
words 
of 
Calvin 
(on 
Genesis, 
ch. 
3): 
‘The 
ears 
of 
some 
are 
offended 
when 
one 
says 
that 
God 
willed 
it. 
But 
I 
ask 
you, 
what 
else 
is 
the 
permission 
of 
him 
who 
is 
entitled 
to 
forbid, 
or 
rather 
who 
has 
thething 
in 
his 
own 
hands,but 
anact 
ofwill?’ 
M. 
Bayle 
explains 
these 
words 
of 
Calvin, 
and 
those 
which 
precede 
them, 
as 
if 
he 
admitted 
that 
God 
willed 
the 
fall 
of 
Adam, 
not 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
was 
a 
crime, 
but 
under 
some 
other 
conception 
that 
is 
unknown 
to 
us. 
He 
quotes 
casuists 
who 
are 
somewhat 
lax, 
who 
say 
that 
a 
son 
can 
desire 
the 
death 
of 
his 
father, 
not 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
an 
evil 
for 
himself 
but 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
a 
good 
for 
his 
heirs 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
ch. 
147, 
). 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
Calvin 
only 
says 
that 
God 
willed 
man’s 
fall 
for 
some 
reason 
unknown 
to 
us. 
In 
the 
main, 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
a 
decisive 
will, 
that 
is, 
of 
a 
decree, 
these 
distinctions 
are 
useless: 
one 
wills 
the 
action 
with 
all 
its 
qualities, 
if 
it 
is 
true 
that 
one 
wills 
it. 
But 
when 
it 
is 
a 
crime, 
God 
can 
only 
will 
the 
permission 
of 
it: 
the 
crime 
is 
neither 
an 
end 
nor 
a 
means, 
it 
is 
only 
a 
conditio 
sine 
qua 
non; 
thus 
it 
is 
not 
the 
object 
of 
a 
direct 
will, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
demonstrated 
above. 
God 
cannot 
prevent 
it 
without 
acting 
against 
what 
he 
owes 
to 
himself, 
without 
doing 
something 
that 
would 
be 
worse 
than 
the 
crime 
of 
man, 
without 
violating 
the 
rule 
of 
the 
best; 
and 
that 
would 
be 
to 
destroy 
divinity, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
observed. 
God 
is 
therefore 
bound 
by 
a 
moral 
necessity, 
which 
is 
in 
himself, 
to 
permit 
moral 
evil 
in 
creatures. 
There 
is 
precisely 
the 
case 
wherein 
the 
will 
of 
a 
wise 
mind 
is 
only 
permissive. 
I 
have 
already 
said 
this: 
he 
is 
bound 
to 
permit 
the 
crime 
of 
others 
when 
he 
cannot 
prevent 
it 
without 
himself 
failing 
inthatwhich 
heowestohimself. 

159. 
‘But 
among 
all 
these 
infinite 
combinations’, 
says 
M. 
Bayle 
(), 
‘it 
pleased 
God 
to 
choose 
one 
wherein 
Adam 
was 
to 
sin, 
and 
by 
his 
decree 
he 
made 
it, 
in 
preference 
to 
all 
the 
others, 
the 
plan 
that 
should 
come 
to 
pass.’ 
Very 
good; 
that 
is 
speaking 
my 
language; 
so 
long 
as 
one 
applies 
it 
to 
the 
combinations 
which 
compose 
the 
whole 
universe. 
‘You 
will 
therefore 
never 
make 
us 
understand’, 
he 
adds, 
‘how 
God 
did 
not 
will 
that 
Eve 
and 
Adam 
should 
sin, 
since 
he 
rejected 
all 
the 
combinations 
wherein 
they 
would 
not 
have 
sinned.’ 
But 
the 
thing 
is 
in 
general 
very 
easy 
to 
understand, 
from 
all 
that 
I 
have 
just 
said. 
This 
combination 
that 
makes 
the 
whole 
universe 
is 
the 
best; 
God 
therefore 
could 
not 
refrain 
from 
choosing 
it 
without 
incurring 
a 
lapse, 
and 
rather 
than 
incur 
such, 
a 
thing 
altogether 
inappropriate 
to 
him, 
he 
permits 
thelapseorthesinof 
manwhich 
isinvolved 
inthiscombination. 
160. 
M. 
Jacquelot, 
with 
other 
able 
men, 
does 
not 
differ 
in 
opinion 
from 
me,whenforexamplehesays, 
ofhistreatiseonthe 
Conformity 
of 
Faith 
with 
Reason: 
‘Those 
who 
are 
puzzled 
by 
these 
difficulties 
seem 
to 
be 
too 
limited 
in 
their 
outlook, 
and 
to 
wish 
to 
reduce 
all 
God’s 
designs 
to 
their 
own 
interests. 
WhenGodformedtheuniverse,hiswholeprospectwas 
himself 
and 
his 
own 
glory, 
so 
that 
if 
we 
had 
knowledge 
of 
all 
creatures, 
of 
their 
diverse 
combinations 
and 
of 
their 
different 
relations, 
we 
should 
understand 
without 
difficulty 
that 
the 
universe 
corresponds 
perfectly 
to 
the 
infinite 
wisdom 
of 
the 
Almighty.’ 
He 
says 
elsewhere 
(): 
‘Supposing 
the 
impossible, 
that 
God 
could 
not 
prevent 
the 
wrong 
use 
of 
free 
will 
without 
destroying 
it, 
it 
will 
be 
agreed 
that 
since 
his 
wisdom 
and 
his 
glory 
determined 
him 
to 
form 
free 
creatures 
this 
powerful 
reason 
must 
have 
prevailed 
over 
the 
grievous 
consequences 
which 
their 
freedom 
might 
have.’ 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
develop 
this 
still 
further 
through 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
best 
and 
the 
moral 
necessity 
which 
led 
God 
to 
make 
this 
choice, 
despite 
the 
sin 
of 
some 
creatures 
which 
is 
involved 
therein. 
I 
think 
that 
I 
have 
cut 
down 
to 
the 
root 
of 
the 
difficulty; 
nevertheless 

I 
am 
well 
pleased, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
throwing 
more 
light 
on 
the 
matter, 
to 
apply 
myprincipleof 
solutiontothepeculiardifficulties 
ofM. 
Bayle. 


161. 
Here 
is 
one, 
set 
forth 
in 
these 
terms 
(ch. 
148, 
): 
‘Would 
it 
in 
a 
prince 
be 
a 
mark 
of 
his 
kindness: 
1. 
To 
give 
to 
a 
hundred 
messengers 
as 
much 
money 
as 
is 
needed 
for 
a 
journey 
of 
two 
hundred 
leagues? 
2. 
To 
promise 
a 
recompense 
to 
all 
those 
who 
should 
finish 
the 
journey 
without 
having 
borrowed 
anything, 
and 
to 
threaten 
with 
imprisonment 
all 
those 
whom 
their 
money 
should 
not 
have 
sufficed? 
3. 
To 
make 
choice 
of 
a 
hundred 
persons, 
of 
whom 
he 
would 
know 
for 
certain 
that 
there 
were 
but 
two 
who 
should 
earn 
the 
recompense, 
the 
ninety-eight 
others 
being 
destined 
to 
find 
on 
the 
way 
either 
a 
mistress 
or 
a 
gamester 
or 
some 
other 
thing 
which 
would 
make 
them 
incur 
expenses, 
and 
which 
he 
would 
himself 
have 
been 
at 
pains 
to 
dispose 
in 
certain 
places 
along 
their 
path? 
4. 
To 
imprison 
actually 
ninety-eight 
of 
these 
messengers 
on 
the 
moment 
of 
their 
return? 
Is 
it 
not 
abundantly 
evident 
that 
hewouldhavenokindnessforthem,andthaton 
the 
contraryhewouldintend 
for 
them, 
not 
the 
proposed 
recompense, 
but 
prison? 
They 
would 
deserve 
it, 
certainly; 
but 
he 
who 
had 
wished 
them 
to 
deserve 
it 
and 
placed 
them 
in 
the 
sure 
way 
towards 
deserving 
it, 
should 
he 
be 
worthy 
of 
being 
called 
kind, 
on 
the 
pretext 
that 
he 
had 
recompensed 
the 
two 
others?’ 
It 
would 
doubtless 
not 
be 
on 
that 
account 
that 
he 
earned 
the 
title 
of 
‘kind’. 
Yet 
other 
circumstances 
may 
contribute, 
which 
would 
avail 
to 
render 
him 
worthy 
of 
praise 
for 
having 
employed 
this 
artifice 
in 
order 
to 
know 
those 
people, 
and 
to 
make 
trial 
of 
them; 
just 
as 
Gideon 
made 
use 
of 
some 
extraordinary 
means 
of 
choosing 
the 
most 
valiant 
and 
the 
least 
squeamish 
among 
his 
soldiers. 
And 
even 
if 
the 
prince 
were 
to 
know 
already 
the 
disposition 
of 
all 
these 
messengers, 
may 
he 
not 
put 
them 
to 
this 
test 
in 
order 
to 
make 
them 
known 
also 
to 
the 
others? 
Even 
though 
these 
reasons 
be 
not 
applicable 
to 
God, 
they 
make 
it 
clear, 
nevertheless, 
that 
an 
action 
like 
that 
of 
this 
prince 
may 
appear 
preposterous 

when 
it 
is 
detached 
from 
the 
circumstan 
must 
one 
deem 
that 
God 
has 
acted

fullyknewofall 
thathehasdone. 


162. 
M. 
Descartes, 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
has 
made 
use 
of 
another 
comparison 
to 
omnipotence 
of 
God. 
‘He

PART 
THREE 



241. 
NOW 
AT 
last 
I 
have 
disposed 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
moral 
evil; 
physical 
evil, 
that 
is, 
sorrows, 
sufferings, 
miseries, 
will 
be 
less 
troublesome 
to 
explain, 
since 
these 
are 
results 
of 
moral 
evil. 
Poena 
est 
malum 
passionis, 
quod 
infligitur 
ob 
malum 
actionis, 
according 
to 
Grotius. 
One 
suffers 
because 
one 
hasacted;onesuffersevilbecause 
onedoes 
evil. 
Nostrorum 
causa 
malorum 


Nos 
sumus. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
one 
often 
suffers 
through 
the 
evil 
actions 
of 
others; 
but 
when 
one 
has 
no 
part 
in 
the 
offence 
one 
must 
look 
upon 
it 
as 
a 
certainty 
that 
these 
sufferings 
prepare 
for 
us 
a 
greater 
happiness. 
The 
question 
of 
physical 
evil, 
that 
is, 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
sufferings, 
has 
difficulties 
in 
common 
with 
that 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
metaphysical 
evil, 
examples 
whereof 
are 
furnished 
by 
the 
monstrosities 
and 
other 
apparent 
irregularities 
of 
the 
universe. 
But 
one 
must 
believe 
that 
even 
sufferings 
and 
monstrosities 
are 
part 
of 
order; 
and 
it 
is 
well 
to 
bear 
in 
mind 
not 
only 
that 
it 
was 
better 
to 
admit 
these 
defects 
and 
these 
monstrosities 
than 
to 
violate 
general 
laws, 
as 
Father 
Malebranche 
sometimes 
argues, 
but 
also 
that 
these 
very 
monstrosities 
are 
in 
the 
rules, 
and 
are 
in 
conformity 
with 
general 
acts 
of 
will, 
though 
we 
be 
not 
capable 
of 
discerning 
this 
conformity. 
It 
is 
just 
as 
sometimes 
there 
are 
appearances 
of 
irregularity 
in 
mathematics 
which 
issue 
finally 
in 
a 
great 
order 
when 
one 
has 
finally 
got 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
them: 
that 
is 
why 
I 
have 
already 
in 
this 
work 
observed 
that 
according 
to 
my 
principles 
all 
individual 
events, 
without 
exception, 
are 
consequencesof 
general 
actsofwill. 


242. 
It 
should 
be 
no 
cause 
for 
astonishment 
that 
I 
endeavour 
to 
elucidate 
these 
things 
by 
comparisons 
taken 
from 
pure 
mathematics, 
where 
everything 

proceeds 
in 
order, 
and 
where 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
fathom 
them 
by 
a 
close 
contemplation 
which 
grants 
us 
an 
enjoyment, 
so 
to 
speak, 
of 
the 
vision 
of 
the 
ideas 
of 
God. 
One 
may 
propose 
a 
succession 
or 
series 
of 
numbers 
perfectly 
irregular 
to 
all 
appearance, 
where 
the 
numbers 
increase 
and 
diminish 
variably 
without 
the 
emergence 
of 
any 
order; 
and 
yet 
he 
who 
knows 
the 
key 
to 
the 
formula, 
and 
who 
understands 
the 
origin 
and 
the 
structure 
of 
this 
succession 
of 
numbers, 
will 
be 
able 
to 
give 
a 
rule 
which, 
being 
properly 
understood, 
will 
show 
that 
the 
series 
is 
perfectly 
regular, 
and 
that 
it 
even 
has 
excellent 
properties. 
One 
may 
make 
this 
still 
more 
evident 
in 
lines. 
A 
line 
may 
have 
twists 
and 
turns, 
ups 
and 
downs, 
points 
of 
reflexion 
and 
points 
of 
inflexion, 
interruptions 
and 
other 
variations, 
so 
that 
one 
sees 
neither 
rhyme 
nor 
reason 
therein, 
especially 
when 
taking 
into 
account 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
line; 
and 
yet 
it 
may 
be 
that 
one 
can 
give 
its 
equation 
and 
construction, 
wherein 
a 
geometrician 
would 
find 
the 
reason 
and 
the 
fittingness 
of 
all 
these 
so-called 
irregularities. 
That 
is 
how 
we 
must 
look 
upon 
the 
irregularities 
constituted 
by 
monstrosities 
andotherso-calleddefects 
intheuniverse. 


243. 
In 
this 
sense 
one 
may 
apply 
that 
fine 
adage 
of 
St. 
Bernard 
(E, 
Ad 
Eugen. 
III): 
‘Ordinatissimum 
est, 
minus 
interdum 
ordinate 
fieri 
aliquid.’ 
It 
belongs 
to 
the 
great 
order 
that 
there 
should 
be 
some 
small 
disorder. 
One 
may 
even 
say 
that 
this 
small 
disorder 
is 
apparent 
only 
in 
the 
whole, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
even 
apparent 
when 
one 
considers 
the 
happiness 
of 
those 
who 
walk 
in 
the 
waysoforder. 
244. 
When 
I 
mention 
monstrosities 
I 
include 
numerous 
other 
apparent 
defects 
besides. 
We 
are 
acquainted 
with 
hardly 
anything 
but 
the 
surface 
of 
our 
globe; 
we 
scarce 
penetrate 
into 
its 
interior 
beyond 
a 
few 
hundred 
fathoms. 
That 
which 
we 
find 
in 
this 
crust 
of 
the 
globe 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
effect 
of 
some 
great 
upheavals. 
It 
seems 
that 
this 
globe 
was 
once 
on 
fire, 
and 
that 
the 
rocks 
forming 
the 
base 
of 
this 
crust 
of 
the 
earth 
are 
scoria 
remaining 
from 

a 
great 
fusion. 
In 
their 
entrails 
are 
found 
metal 
and 
mineral 
products, 
which 
closely 
resemble 
those 
emanating 
from 
our 
furnaces: 
and 
the 
entire 
sea 
may 
be 
a 
kind 
of 
oleum 
per 
deliquium, 
just 
as 
tartaric 
oil 
forms 
in 
a 
damp 
place. 
For 
when 
the 
earth’s 
surface 
cooled 
after 
the 
great 
conflagration 
the 
moisture 
that 
thefirehad 
drivenintothe 
air 
fellback 
uponthe 
earth,washeditssurface 
and 
dissolved 
and 
absorbed 
the 
solid 
salt 
that 
was 
left 
in 
the 
cinders, 
finally 
filling 
up 
this 
great 
cavity 
in 
the 
surface 
of 
our 
globe, 
to 
form 
the 
ocean 
filled 
withsaltwater. 


245. 
But, 
after 
the 
fire, 
one 
must 
conclude 
that 
earth 
and 
water 
made 
ravages 
no 
less. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
the 
crust 
formed 
by 
the 
cooling, 
having 
below 
it 
great 
cavities, 
fell 
in, 
so 
that 
we 
live 
only 
on 
ruins, 
as 
among 
others 
Thomas 
Burnet, 
Chaplain 
to 
the 
late 
King 
of 
Great 
Britain, 
aptly 
observed. 
Sundry 
deluges 
and 
inundations 
have 
left 
deposits, 
whereof 
traces 
and 
remains 
are 
found 
which 
show 
that 
the 
sea 
was 
in 
places 
that 
to-day 
are 
most 
remote 
from 
it. 
But 
these 
upheavals 
ceased 
at 
last, 
and 
the 
globe 
assumed 
the 
shape 
that 
we 
see. 
Moses 
hints 
at 
these 
changes 
in 
few 
words: 
the 
separation 
of 
light 
from 
darkness 
indicates 
the 
melting 
caused 
by 
the 
fire; 
and 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
moist 
from 
the 
dry 
marks 
the 
effects 
of 
inundations. 
But 
who 
does 
not 
see 
that 
these 
disorders 
have 
served 
to 
bring 
things 
to 
the 
point 
where 
they 
now 
are, 
that 
we 
owe 
to 
them 
our 
riches 
and 
our 
comforts, 
and 
that 
through 
their 
agency 
this 
globe 
became 
fit 
for 
cultivation 
by 
us. 
These 
disorders 
passed 
into 
order. 
The 
disorders, 
real 
or 
apparent, 
that 
we 
see 
from 
afar 
are 
sunspots 
and 
comets; 
but 
we 
do 
not 
know 
what 
uses 
they 
supply, 
nor 
the 
rules 
prevailing 
therein. 
Time 
was 
when 
the 
planets 
were 
held 
to 
be 
wandering 
stars: 
now 
their 
motion 
is 
found 
to 
be 
regular. 
Peradventure 
it 
is 
thesamewiththecomets:posteritywillknow. 
246. 
One 
does 
not 
include 
among 
the 
disorders 
inequality 
of 
conditions, 
and 
M. 
Jacquelot 
is 
justified 
in 
asking 
those 
who 
would 
have 
everything 

equally 
perfect, 
why 
rocks 
are 
not 
crowned 
with 
leaves 
and 
flowers? 
why 
ants 
are 
not 
peacocks? 
And 
if 
there 
must 
needs 
be 
equality 
everywhere, 
the 
poor 
man 
would 
serve 
notice 
of 
appeal 
against 
the 
rich, 
the 
servant 
against 
themaster. 
Thepipesofanorganmust 
notbe 
ofequalsize. 
M. 
Baylewillsay 
that 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
a 
privation 
of 
good 
and 
a 
disorder; 
between 
a 
disorder 
in 
inanimate 
things, 
which 
is 
purely 
metaphysical, 
and 
a 
disorder 
in 
rational 
creatures, 
which 
is 
composed 
of 
crime 
and 
sufferings. 
He 
is 
right 
inmakingadistinctionbetweenthem, 
andIamrightincombining 
them. 
God 
does 
not 
neglect 
inanimate 
things: 
they 
do 
not 
feel, 
but 
God 
feels 
for 
them. 
He 
does 
not 
neglect 
animals: 
they 
have 
not 
intelligence, 
but 
God 
has 
it 
for 
them. 
He 
would 
reproach 
himself 
for 
the 
slightest 
actual 
defect 
there 
were 
in 
theuniverse, 
eventhoughitwereperceivedofnone. 


247. 
It 
seems 
M. 
Bayle 
does 
not 
approve 
any 
comparison 
between 
the 
disorders 
which 
may 
exist 
in 
inanimate 
things 
and 
those 
which 
trouble 
the 
peace 
and 
happiness 
of 
rational 
creatures; 
nor 
would 
he 
agree 
to 
our 
justifying 
the 
permission 
of 
vice 
on 
the 
pretext 
of 
the 
care 
that 
must 
be 
taken 
toavoiddisturbingthelawsofmotion. 
Onemightthenceconclude,according 
to 
him 
(posthumous 
Reply 
to 
M. 
Jacquelot, 
), 
‘that 
God 
created 
the 
world 
only 
to 
display 
his 
infinite 
skill 
in 
architecture 
and 
mechanics, 
whilst 
his 
property 
of 
goodness 
and 
love 
of 
virtue 
took 
no 
part 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
this 
great 
work. 
This 
God 
would 
pride 
himself 
only 
on 
skill; 
he 
would 
prefer 
to 
let 
the 
whole 
human 
kind 
perish 
rather 
than 
suffer 
some 
atoms 
to 
go 
faster 
or 
more 
slowly 
than 
general 
laws 
require.’ 
M. 
Bayle 
would 
not 
have 
made 
this 
antithesis 
if 
he 
had 
been 
informed 
on 
the 
system 
of 
general 
harmony 
which 
I 
assume, 
which 
states 
that 
the 
realm 
of 
efficient 
causes 
and 
that 
of 
final 
causes 
are 
parallel 
to 
each 
other; 
that 
God 
has 
no 
less 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
best 
monarch 
than 
that 
of 
the 
greatest 
architect; 
that 
matter 
is 
so 
disposed 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
serve 
as 
the 
best 
guidance 
for 
spirits; 
and 
that 

consequently 
it 
will 
prove 
that 
he 
has 
attained 
the 
utmost 
good 
possible, 
providedonereckonthemetaphysical,physicalandmoralgoodstogether. 


248. 
But 
(M. 
Bayle 
will 
say) 
God 
having 
power 
to 
avert 
innumerable 
evils 
by 
one 
small 
miracle, 
why 
did 
he 
not 
employ 
it? 
He 
gives 
so 
much 
extraordinary 
help 
to 
fallen 
men; 
but 
slight 
help 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
given 
to 
Eve 
would 
have 
prevented 
her 
fall 
and 
rendered 
the 
temptation 
of 
the 
serpent 
ineffective. 
I 
have 
sufficiently 
met 
objections 
of 
this 
sort 
with 
this 
general 
answer, 
that 
God 
ought 
not 
to 
make 
choice 
of 
another 
universe 
since 
he 
has 
chosen 
the 
best, 
and 
has 
only 
made 
use 
of 
the 
miracles 
necessary 
thereto. 
I 
had 
answeredM. 
Baylethatmiracleschangethenaturalorderof 
theuniverse. 
Hereplies,thatthatisan 
illusion,and 
that 
the 
miracle 
of 
theweddingat 
Cana 
(for 
instance) 
made 
no 
change 
in 
the 
air 
of 
the 
room, 
except 
that 
instead 
of 
receiving 
into 
its 
pores 
some 
corpuscles 
of 
water, 
it 
received 
corpuscles 
of 
wine. 
But 
one 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
once 
the 
best 
plan 
of 
things 
has 
been 
chosennothingcanbechangedtherein. 
249. 
As 
for 
miracles 
(concerning 
which 
I 
have 
already 
said 
something 
in 
this 
work), 
they 
are 
perhaps 
not 
all 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
kind: 
there 
are 
many, 
to 
all 
appearances, 
which 
God 
brings 
about 
through 
the 
ministry 
of 
invisible 
substances, 
such 
as 
the 
angels, 
as 
Father 
Malebranche 
also 
believes. 
These 
angels 
or 
these 
substances 
act 
according 
to 
the 
ordinary 
laws 
of 
their 
nature, 
being 
combined 
with 
bodies 
more 
rarefied 
and 
more 
vigorous 
than 
those 
we 
have 
at 
our 
command. 
And 
such 
miracles 
are 
only 
so 
by 
comparison, 
and 
in 
relation 
to 
us; 
just 
as 
our 
works 
would 
be 
considered 
miraculous 
amongst 
animals 
if 
they 
were 
capable 
of 
remarking 
upon 
them. 
The 
changing 
of 
water 
into 
wine 
might 
be 
a 
miracle 
of 
this 
kind. 
But 
the 
Creation, 
the 
Incarnation 
and 
some 
other 
actions 
of 
God 
exceed 
all 
the 
power 
of 
creatures 
and 
are 
truly 
miracles, 
or 
indeed 
Mysteries. 
If, 
nevertheless, 
the 
changing 
of 
water 
into 
wine 
at 
Cana 
was 
a 
miracle 
of 
the 
highest 
kind, 
God 
would 
have 
thereby 

changed 
the 
whole 
course 
of 
the 
universe, 
because 
of 
the 
connexion 
of 
bodies; 
or 
else 
he 
would 
have 
been 
bound 
to 
prevent 
this 
connexion 
miraculously 
also, 
and 
cause 
the 
bodies 
not 
concerned 
in 
the 
miracle 
to 
act 
as 
if 
no 
miracle 
had 
happened. 
After 
the 
miracle 
was 
over, 
it 
would 
have 
been 
necessary 
to 
restore 
all 
things 
in 
those 
very 
bodies 
concerned 
to 
the 
state 
they 
would 
have 
reached 
without 
the 
miracle: 
whereafter 
all 
would 
have 
returned 
toits 
originalcourse. 
Thusthismiracledemanded

250. 
As 
for 
physical 
evil 
in 
creatures, 
to 
wit 
their 
sufferings, 
M. 
Bayle 
contends 
vigorously 
against 
those 
who 
endeavour 
to 
justify 
by 
means 
of 
particular 
reasons 
the 
course 
of 
action 
pursued 
by 
God 
in 
regard 
to 
this. 
Here 
I 
set 
aside 
the 
sufferings 
of 
animals, 
and 
I 
see 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
insists 
chiefly 
on 
those 
of 
men, 
perhaps 
because 
he 
thinks 
that 
brute 
beasts 
have 
no 
feeling. 
It 
is 
on 
account 
of 
the 
injustice 
there 
would 
be 
in 
the 
sufferings 
of 
beasts 
that 
divers 
Cartesians 
wished 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
are 
only 
machines, 
quoniam 
sub 
Deo 
justo 
nemo 
innocens 
miser 
est: 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
an 
innocent 
creature 
should 
be 
unhappy 
under 
such 
a 
master 
as 
God. 
The 
principle 
is 
good, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
think 
it 
warrants 
the 
inference 
that 
beasts 
have 
no 
feeling, 
because 
I 
think 
that, 
properly 
speaking, 
perception 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
cause 
misery 
if 
it 
is 
not 
accompanied 
by 
reflexion. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
happiness: 
without 
reflexionthereis 
none. 
O 
fortunatos 
nimium, 
sua 
qui 
bona 
norint! 


One 
cannot 
reasonably 
doubt 
the 
existence 
of 
pain 
among 
animals; 
but 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
their 
pleasures 
and 
their 
pains 
are 
not 
so 
keen 
as 
they 
are 
in 
man: 
for 
animals, 
since 
they 
do 
not 
reflect, 
are 
susceptible 
neither 
to 
the 
grief 
that 
accompanies 
pain, 
nor 
to 
the 
joy 
that 
accompanies 
pleasure. 
Men 
are 
sometimes 
in 
a 
state 
approaching 
that 
of 
the 
beasts, 
when 
they 
act 
almost 
on 
instinct 
alone 
and 
simply 
on 
the 
impressions 
made 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
senses:and,in 
thisstate,theirpleasuresandtheirpainsareveryslight. 



251. 
But 
let 
us 
pass 
from 
the 
beasts 
and 
return 
to 
rational 
creatures. 
It 
is 
with 
regard 
to 
them 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
discusses 
this 
question: 
whether 
there 
is 
more 
physical 
evil 
than 
physical 
good 
in 
the 
world? 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
II, 
ch. 
75.) 
To 
settle 
it 
aright, 
one 
must 
explain 
wherein 
these 
goods 
and 
evils 
lie. 
We 
are 
agreed 
that 
physical 
evil 
is 
simply 
displeasure 
and 
under 
that 
heading 
I 
include 
pain, 
grief, 
and 
every 
other 
kind 
of 
discomfort. 
But 
does 
physical 
good 
lie 
solely 
in 
pleasure? 
M. 
Bayle 
appears 
to 
be 
of 
this 
opinion; 
but 
I 
consider 
that 
it 
lies 
also 
in 
a 
middle 
state, 
such 
as 
that 
of 
health. 
One 
is 
well 
enough 
when 
one 
has 
no 
ill; 
it 
is 
a 
degree 
ofwisdomto 
havenofolly: 
Sapientia 
prima 
est, 


Stultitia 
caruisse. 


In 
the 
same 
way 
one 
is 
worthy 
of 
praise 
when 
one 
cannot 
with 
justice 
be 
blamed: 


Si 
non 
culpabor, 
sat 
mihi 
laudis 
erit. 


That 
being 
the 
case, 
all 
the 
sensations 
not 
unpleasing 
to 
us, 
all 
the 
exercises 
of 
our 
powers 
that 
do 
not 
incommode 
us, 
and 
whose 
prevention 
would 
incommode 
us, 
are 
physical 
goods, 
even 
when 
they 
cause 
us 
no 
pleasure; 
for 
privation 
of 
them 
is 
a 
physical 
evil. 
Besides 
we 
only 
perceive 
the 
good 
of 
health, 
and 
other 
like 
goods, 
when 
we 
are 
deprived 
of 
them. 
On 
those 
terms 
I 
would 
dare 
to 
maintain 
that 
even 
in 
this 
life 
goods 
exceed 
evils, 
that 
our 
comforts 
exceed 
our 
discomforts, 
and 
that 
M. 
Descartes 
was 
justified 
in 
writing 
(vol. 
I, 
Letter 
9) 
‘that 
natural 
reason 
teaches 
us 
that 
we 
have 
more 
goodsthanevilsinthis 
life’. 


252. 
Itmust 
be 
added 
that 
pleasures 
enjoyed 
toooften 
and 
to 
excess 
would 
be 
a 
very 
great 
evil. 
There 
are 
some 
which 
Hippocrates 
compared 
to 
the 
falling 
sickness, 
and 
Scioppius 
doubtless 
only 
made 
pretence 
of 
envying 
the 

sparrows 
in 
order 
to 
be 
agreeably 
playful 
in 
a 
learned 
and 
far 
from 
playful 
work. 
Highly 
seasoned 
foods 
are 
injurious 
to 
health 
and 
impair 
the 
niceness 
of 
a 
delicate 
sense; 
and 
in 
general 
bodily 
pleasures 
are 
a 
kind 
of 
expenditure 
ofthespirit,thoughtheybemadegood 
insomebetter 
thaninothers. 


253. 
As 
proof, 
however, 
that 
the 
evil 
exceeds 
the 
good 
is 
quoted 
the 
instance 
of 
M. 
de 
la 
Motte 
le 
Vayer 
(Letter 
134), 
who 
would 
not 
have 
been 
willing 
to 
return 
to 
the 
world, 
supposing 
he 
had 
had 
to 
play 
the 
same 
part 
as 
providence 
had 
already 
assigned 
to 
him. 
But 
I 
have 
already 
said 
that 
I 
think 
one 
would 
accept 
the 
proposal 
of 
him 
who 
could 
re-knot 
the 
thread 
of 
Fate 
if 
a 
new 
part 
were 
promised 
to 
us, 
even 
though 
it 
should 
not 
be 
better 
than 
the 
first. 
Thus 
from 
M. 
de 
la 
Motte 
le 
Vayer’s 
saying 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
he 
would 
not 
have 
wished 
for 
the 
part 
he 
had 
already 
played, 
provided 
it 
had 
beennew,asM. 
Bayle 
seemsto 
takeit. 
254. 
The 
pleasures 
of 
the 
mind 
are 
the 
purest, 
and 
of 
greatest 
service 
in 
making 
joy 
endure. 
Cardan, 
when 
already 
an 
old 
man, 
was 
so 
content 
with 
his 
state 
that 
he 
protested 
solemnly 
that 
he 
would 
not 
exchange 
it 
for 
the 
state 
of 
the 
richest 
of 
young 
men 
who 
at 
the 
same 
time 
was 
ignorant. 
M. 
de 
la 
Motte 
le 
Vayer 
quotes 
the 
saying 
himself 
without 
criticizing 
it. 
Knowledge 
has 
doubtless 
charms 
which 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
by 
those 
who 
have 
not 
tasted 
them. 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
a 
mere 
knowledge 
of 
facts 
without 
that 
of 
reasons, 
but 
knowledge 
like 
that 
of 
Cardan, 
who 
with 
all 
his 
faults 
was 
a 
great 
man, 
and 
wouldhave 
been 
incomparablewithoutthosefaults. 
Felix, 
qui 
potuit 
rerum 
cognoscere 
causas! 
Ille 
metus 
omnes 
et 
inexorabile 
fatum 
Subjecit 
pedibus. 


It 
is 
no 
small 
thing 
to 
be 
content 
with 
God 
and 
with 
the 
universe, 
not 
to 
fear 
what 
destiny 
has 
in 
store 
for 
us, 
nor 
to 
complain 
of 
what 
befalls 
us. 
Acquaintance 
with 
true 
principles 
gives 
us 
this 
advantage, 
quite 
other 
than 



that 
the 
Stoics 
and 
the 
Epicureans 
derived 
from 
their 
philosophy. 
There 
is 
as 
much 
difference 
between 
true 
morality 
and 
theirs 
as 
there 
is 
between 
joy 
and 
patience: 
for 
their 
tranquillity 
was 
founded 
only 
on 
necessity, 
while 
ours 
mustrestupontheperfection 
andbeauty 
ofthings,uponourown 
happiness. 


255. 
What, 
then, 
shall 
we 
say 
of 
bodily 
sufferings? 
May 
they 
not 
be 
sufficiently 
acute 
to 
disturb 
the 
sage’s 
tranquillity? 
Aristotle 
assents; 
the 
Stoics 
were 
of 
a 
different 
opinion, 
and 
even 
the 
Epicureans 
likewise. 
M. 
Descartes 
revived 
the 
doctrine 
of 
these 
philosophers; 
he 
says 
in 
the 
letter 
just 
quoted: 
‘that 
even 
amid 
the 
worst 
misfortunes 
and 
the 
most 
overwhelming 
sufferings 
one 
may 
always 
be 
content, 
if 
only 
one 
knows 
how 
to 
exercise 
reason’. 
M. 
Bayle 
says 
concerning 
this 
(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
vol. 
III, 
ch. 
157, 
) 
‘that 
it 
is 
saying 
nothing, 
that 
it 
is 
prescribing 
for 
us 
a 
remedy 
whose 
preparation 
hardly 
anyone 
understands’. 
I 
hold 
that 
the 
thing 
is 
not 
impossible, 
and 
that 
men 
could 
attain 
it 
by 
dint 
of 
meditation 
and 
practice. 
For 
apart 
from 
the 
true 
martyrs 
and 
those 
who 
have 
been 
aided 
in 
wonderful 
wise 
from 
on 
high, 
there 
have 
been 
counterfeits 
who 
imitated 
them. 
That 
Spanish 
slave 
who 
killed 
the 
Carthaginian 
governor 
in 
order 
to 
avenge 
his 
master 
and 
who 
evinced 
great 
joy 
in 
his 
deed, 
even 
in 
the 
greatest 
tortures, 
may 
shame 
the 
philosophers. 
Why 
should 
not 
one 
go 
as 
far 
as 
he? 
Onemaysay 
ofanadvantage,as 
ofadisadvantage: 
Cuivis 
potest 
accidere, 
quod 
cuiquam 
potest. 


256. 
But 
even 
to-day 
entire 
tribes, 
such 
as 
the 
Hurons, 
the 
Iroquois, 
the 
Galibis 
and 
other 
peoples 
of 
America 
teach 
us 
a 
great 
lesson 
on 
this 
matter: 
one 
cannot 
read 
without 
astonishment 
of 
the 
intrepidity 
and 
well-nigh 
insensibility 
wherewith 
they 
brave 
their 
enemies, 
who 
roast 
them 
over 
a 
slow 
fire 
and 
eat 
them 
by 
slices. 
If 
such 
people 
could 
retain 
their 
physical 
superiority 
and 
their 
courage, 
and 
combine 
them 
with 
our 
acquirements, 
they 
would 
surpassusin 
everyway, 

Extat 
ut 
in 
mediis 
turris 
aprica 
casis. 
Theywouldbe,in 
comparison 
with 
us, 
asa 
giant 
to 
a 
dwarf,amountain 
to 
a 
hill: 


Quantus 
Eryx, 
et 
quantus 
Athos, 
gaudetque 
nivali 
Vertice 
se 
attollens 
pater 
Apenninus 
ad 
auras. 


257. 
All 
that 
which 
is 
effected 
by 
a 
wonderful 
vigour 
of 
body 
and 
mind 
in 
these 
savages, 
who 
persist 
obstinately 
in 
the 
strangest 
point 
of 
honour, 
might 
be 
acquired 
in 
our 
case 
by 
training, 
by 
well-seasoned 
mortifications, 
by 
an 
overmastering 
joy 
founded 
on 
reason, 
by 
great 
practice 
in 
preserving 
a 
certain 
presenceofmind 
in 
themidst 
of 
the 
distractions 
and 
impressions 
most 
liable 
to 
disturb 
it. 
Something 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
related 
of 
the 
ancient 
Assassins, 
subjects 
and 
pupils 
of 
the 
Old 
Man 
or 
rather 
the 
Seigneur 
(Senior) 
of 
the 
Mountain. 
Such 
a 
school 
(for 
a 
better 
purpose) 
would 
be 
good 
for 
missionaries 
who 
would 
wish 
to 
return 
to 
Japan. 
The 
Gymnosophists 
of 
the 
ancient 
Indians 
had 
perhaps 
something 
resembling 
this, 
and 
that 
Calanus, 
who 
provided 
for 
Alexander 
the 
Great 
the 
spectacle 
of 
his 
burning 
alive, 
had 
doubtless 
been 
encouraged 
by 
the 
great 
examples 
of 
his 
masters 
and 
trained 
by 
great 
sufferings 
not 
to 
fear 
pain. 
The 
wives 
of 
these 
same 
Indians, 
who 
even 
to-day 
ask 
to 
be 
burned 
with 
the 
bodies 
of 
their 
husbands, 
seem 
still 
to 
keep 
something 
of 
the 
courage 
of 
those 
ancient 
philosophers 
of 
their 
country. 
I 
do 
not 
expect 
that 
there 
should 
straightway 
be 
founded 
a 
religious 
order 
whose 
purpose 
would 
be 
to 
exalt 
man 
to 
that 
high 
pitch 
of 
perfection: 
such 
people 
would 
be 
too 
much 
above 
the 
rest, 
and 
too 
formidable 
for 
the 
authorities. 
As 
it 
rarely 
happens 
that 
people 
are 
exposed 
to 
extremes 
where 
such 
great 
strength 
of 
mind 
would 
be 
needed, 
one 
will 
scarce 
think 
of 
providing 
for 
it 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
our 
usual 
comforts, 
albeit 
incomparably 
morewould 
begainedthan 
lostthereby. 

258. 
Nevertheless 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
one 
has 
no 
need 
of 
that 
great 
remedy 
is 
aproofthatthe 
goodalreadyexceeds 
theevil. 
Euripidesalsosaid: 
πλειωταχρηστατωνκακωνειναι 
βροτοις. 


Mala 
nostra 
longe 
judico 
vinci 
a 
bonis. 


Homer 
and 
divers 
other 
poets 
were 
of 
another 
mind, 
and 
men 
in 
general 
agree 
with 
them. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
that 
the 
evil 
arouses 
our 
attention 
rather 
than 
the 
good: 
but 
this 
same 
reason 
proves 
that 
the 
evil 
is 
more 
rare. 
One 
must 
therefore 
not 
credit 
the 
petulant 
expressions 
of 
Pliny, 
who 
would 
have 
it 
that 
Nature 
is 
a 
stepmother, 
and 
who 
maintains 
that 
man 
is 
the 
most 
unhappy 
and 
most 
vain 
of 
all 
creatures. 
These 
two 
epithets 
do 
not 
agree: 
one 
is 
not 
so 
very 
unhappy, 
when 
one 
is 
full 
of 
oneself. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
men 
hold 
human 
nature 
only 
too 
much 
in 
contempt, 
apparently 
because 
they 
see 
no 
other 
creatures 
capable 
of 
arousing 
their 
emulation; 
but 
they 
have 
all 
too 
much 
self-esteem, 
and 
individually 
are 
but 
too 
easily 
satisfied. 
I 
therefore 
agree 
with 
Meric 
Casaubon, 
who 
in 
his 
notes 
on 
the 
Xenophanes 
of 
Diogenes 
Laertius 
praises 
exceedingly 
the 
admirable 
sentiments 
of 
Euripides, 
going 
so 
far 
as 
to 
credit 
him 
with 
having 
said 
things 
quae 
spirant 
θεοπνευστον 
pectus. 
Seneca 
(Lib. 
4, 
c. 
5, 
De 
Benefic.) 
speaks 
eloquently 
of 
the 
blessings 
Nature 
has 
heaped 
upon 
us. 
M. 
Bayle 
in 
his 
Dictionary, 
article 
‘Xenophanes’, 
brings 
up 
sundry 
authorities 
against 
this, 
and 
among 
others 
that 
of 
the 
poet 
Diphilus 
in 
the 
Collections 
of 
Stobaeus, 
whose 
Greek 
might 
be 
thus 
expressed 
in 
Latin: 


Fortuna 
cyathis 
bibere 
nos 
datis 
jubens, 


Infundit 
uno 
terna 
pro 
bono 
mala. 


259. 
M. 
Baylebelievesthatifit 
were 
aquestiononlyofthe 
evilof 
guilt,or 
of 
moral 
evil 
among 
men, 
the 
case 
would 
soon 
be 
terminated 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
Pliny, 
and 
Euripides 
would 
lose 
his 
action. 
To 
that 
I 
am 
not 
opposed; 
our 
vices 
doubtless 
exceed 
our 
virtues, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
effect 
of 

original 
sin. 
It 
is 
nevertheless 
true 
that 
also 
on 
that 
point 
men 
in 
general 
exaggerate 
things, 
and 
that 
even 
some 
theologians 
disparage 
man 
so 
much 
that 
they 
wrong 
the 
providence 
of 
the 
Author 
of 
mankind. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
am 
not 
in 
favour 
of 
those 
who 
thought 
to 
do 
great 
honour 
to 
our 
religion 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
virtues 
of 
the 
pagans 
were 
only 
splendida 
peccata, 
splendid 
vices. 
It 
is 
a 
sally 
of 
St. 
Augustine’s 
which 
has 
no 
foundation 
in 
holy 
Scripture, 
and 
which 
offends 
reason. 
But 
here 
we 
are 
only 
discussing 
a 
physical 
good 
and 
evil, 
and 
one 
must 
compare 
in 
detail 
the 
prosperities 
and 
the 
adversities 
of 
this 
life. 
M. 
Bayle 
would 
wish 
almost 
to 
set 
aside 
the 
consideration 
of 
health; 
he 
likens 
it 
to 
the 
rarefied 
bodies, 
which 
are 
scarcely 
felt, 
like 
air, 
for 
example; 
but 
he 
likens 
pain 
to 
the 
bodies 
that 
have 
much 
density 
and 
much 
weight 
in 
slight 
volume. 
But 
pain 
itself 
makes 
us 
aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
health 
when 
we 
are 
bereft 
of 
it. 
I 
have 
already 
observed 
that 
excess 
of 
physical 
pleasures 
would 
be 
a 
real 
evil, 
and 
the 
matter 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
otherwise; 
it 
is 
too 
important 
for 
the 
spirit 
to 
be 
free. 
Lactantius 
(Divin. 
Instit. 
lib. 
3, 
ca) 
had 
said 
that 
men 
are 
so 
squeamish 
that 
they 
complain 
of 
the 
slightest 
ill, 
as 
if 
it 
swallowed 
up 
all 
the 
goods 
they 
have 
enjoyed. 
M. 
Bayle 
says, 
concerning 
this, 
that 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
men 
have 
this 
feeling 
warrants 
the 
judgement 
that 
they 
are 
in 
evil 
case, 
since 
it 
is 
feeling

ButI 
answer 
thatpresentfeelingis 
anything 
rather 
than 
the 
true 
measure 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
past 
and 
future. 
I 
grant 
that 
one 
is 
in 
evil 
case 
while 
one 
makes 
these 
peevish 
reflexions; 
but 
that 
does 
not 
exclude 
a 
previous 
state 
of 
well-being, 
nor 
imply 
that, 
everything 
reckonedin 
andallallowancemade,thegooddoes 
not 
exceedthe 
evil. 


260. 
I 
do 
not 
wonder 
that 
the 
pagans, 
dissatisfied 
with 
their 
gods, 
made 
complaints 
against 
Prometheus 
and 
Epimetheus 
for 
having 
forged 
so 
weak 
an 
animal 
as 
man. 
Nor 
do 
I 
wonder 
that 
they 
acclaimed 
the 
fable 
of 
old 
Silenus, 
foster-father 
of 
Bacchus, 
who 
was 
seized 
by 
King 
Midas, 
and 
as 
the 
price 
of 

his 
deliverance 
taught 
him 
that 
ostensibly 
fine 
maxim 
that 
the 
first 
and 
the 
greatest 
of 
goods 
was 
not 
to 
be 
born, 
and 
the 
second, 
to 
depart 
from 
this 
life 
with 
dispatch 
(Cic. 
Tuscul. 
lib. 
1). 
Plato 
believed 
that 
souls 
had 
been 
in 
a 
happier 
state, 
and 
many 
of 
the 
ancients, 
amongst 
others 
Cicero 
in 
his 
Consolation 
(according 
to 
the 
account 
of 
Lactantius), 
believed 
that 
for 
their 
sins 
they 
were 
confined 
in 
bodies 
as 
in 
a 
prison. 
They 
rendered 
thus 
a 
reason 
for 
our 
ills, 
and 
asserted 
their 
prejudices 
against 
human 
life: 
for 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
beautiful 
prison. 
But 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
consideration 
that, 
even 
according 
to 
these 
same 
pagans, 
the 
evils 
of 
this 
life 
would 
be 
counterbalanced 
and 
exceeded 
by 
the 
goods 
of 
past 
and 
future 
lives, 
I 
make 
bold 
to 
say 
that 
weshall 
find,upon 
unbiassed 
scrutiny 
of 
the 
facts, 
that 
taking 
all 
in 
all 
human 
life 
is 
in 
general 
tolerable. 
And 
adding 
thereto 
the 
motives 
of 
religion, 
we 
shall 
be 
content 
with 
the 
order 
God 
has 
set 
therein. 
Moreover, 
for 
a 
better 
judgement 
of 
our 
goods 
and 
our 
evils, 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
read 
Cardan, 
De 
Utilitate 
ex 
Adversis 
Capienda, 
and 
Novarini, 
De 
Occultis 
Dei 
Beneficiis. 


261. 
M. 
Bayle 
dilates 
upon 
the 
misfortunes 
of 
the 
great, 
who 
are 
thought 
to 
be 
the 
most 
fortunate: 
the 
constant 
experience 
of 
the 
fair 
aspect 
of 
their 
condition 
renders 
them 
unaware 
of 
good, 
but 
greatly 
aware 
of 
evil. 
Someone 
will 
say: 
so 
much 
the 
worse 
for 
them; 
if 
they 
know 
not 
how 
to 
enjoy 
the 
advantages 
of 
nature 
and 
fortune, 
is 
that 
the 
fault 
of 
either? 
There 
are 
nevertheless 
great 
men 
possessed 
of 
more 
wisdom, 
who 
know 
how 
to 
profit 
by 
the 
favours 
God 
has 
shown 
them, 
who 
are 
easily 
consoled 
for 
their 
misfortunes, 
and 
who 
even 
turn 
their 
own 
faults 
to 
account. 
M. 
Bayle 
pays 
no 
heed 
to 
that: 
he 
prefers 
to 
listen 
to 
Pliny, 
who 
thinks 
that 
Augustus, 
one 
of 
the 
princes 
most 
favoured 
by 
fortune, 
experienced 
at 
least 
as 
much 
evil 
as 
good. 
I 
admit 
that 
he 
found 
great 
causes 
of 
trouble 
in 
his 
family 
and 
that 
remorse 
for 
having 
crushed 
the 
Republic 
may 
have 
tormented 
him; 
but 
I 

think 
that 
he 
was 
too 
wise 
to 
grieve 
over 
the 
former, 
and 
that 
Maecenas 
apparently 
made 
him 
understand 
that 
Rome 
had 
need 
of 
a 
master. 
Had 
not 
Augustus 
been 
converted 
on 
this 
point, 
Vergil 
would 
never 
have 
said 
of 
a 
lost 
soul: 


Vendidit 
hic 
auro 
patriam 
Dominumque 
potentem 


Imposuit, 
fixit 
leges 
pretio 
atque 
refixit. 


Augustus 
would 
have 
thought 
that 
he 
and 
Caesar 
were 
alluded 
to 
in 
these 
lines, 
which 
speak 
of 
a 
master 
given 
to 
a 
free 
state. 
But 
there 
is 
every 
indication 
that 
he 
applied 
it 
just 
as 
little 
to 
his 
dominion, 
which 
he 
regarded 
as 
compatible 
with 
liberty 
and 
as 
a 
necessary 
remedy 
for 
public 
evils, 
as 
the 
princes 
of 
to-day 
apply 
to 
themselves 
the 
words 
used 
of 
the 
kings 
censured 
in 


M. 
de 
Cambray’s 
Telemachus. 
Each 
one 
considers 
himself 
within 
his 
rights. 
Tacitus, 
an 
unbiassed 
writer, 
justifies 
Augustus 
in 
two 
words, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
Annals. 
But 
Augustus 
was 
better 
able 
than 
anyone 
to 
judge 
of 
his 
good 
fortune. 
He 
appears 
to 
have 
died 
content, 
as 
may 
be 
inferred 
from 
a 
proof 
he 
gave 
of 
contentedness 
with 
his 
life: 
for 
in 
dying 
he 
repeated 
to 
his 
friends 
a 
line 
in 
Greek, 
which 
has 
the 
signification 
of 
that 
Plaudite 
that 
was 
wontto 
bespokenat 
theconclusionofawell-acted 
play. 
Suetoniusquotesit: 
Δοτεκροτονκαιπαντες

262. 
But 
even 
though 
there 
should 
have 
fallen 
to 
the 
lot 
of 
the 
human 
kind 
more 
evil 
than 
good, 
it 
is 
enough 
where 
God 
is 
concerned 
that 
there 
is 
incomparablymoregoodthanevilintheuniverse. 
RabbiMaimonides(whose 
merit 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
recognized 
in 
the 
statement 
that 
he 
is 
the 
first 
of 
the 
Rabbis 
to 
have 
ceased 
talking 
nonsense) 
also 
gave 
wise 
judgement 
on 
this 
question 
of 
the 
predominance 
of 
good 
over 
evil 
in 
the 
world. 
Here 
is 
what 
he 
says 
in 
his 
Doctor 
Perplexorum 
(ca, 
): 
‘There 
arise 
often 
in 
the 
hearts 
of 
illinstructedpersons 
thoughtswhich 
persuade 
them 
there 
is 
moreevil 
thangood 
in 
the 
world: 
and 
one 
often 
finds 
in 
the 
poems 
and 
songs 
of 
the 
pagans 
that 
it 

is 
as 
it 
were 
a 
miracle 
when 
something 
good 
comes 
to 
pass, 
whereas 
evils 
are 
usual 
and 
constant. 
This 
error 
has 
taken 
hold 
not 
of 
the 
common 
herd 
only, 
those 
very 
persons 
who 
wish 
to 
be 
considered 
wise 
have 
been 
beguiled 
thereby. 
A 
celebrated 
writer 
named 
Alrasi, 
in 
his 
Sepher 
Elohuth, 
or 
Theosophy, 
amongst 
other 
absurdities 
has 
stated 
that 
there 
are 
more 
evils 
than 
goods, 
and 
that 
upon 
comparison 
of 
the 
recreations 
and 
the 
pleasures 
man 
enjoys 
in 
times 
of 
tranquillity 
with 
the 
pains, 
the 
torments, 
the 
troubles, 
faults, 
cares, 
griefs 
and 
afflictions 
whereby 
he 
is 
overwhelmed 
our 
life 
would 
prove 
to 
be 
a 
great 
evil, 
and 
an 
actual 
penalty 
inflicted 
upon 
us 
to 
punish 
us.’ 
Maimonides 
adds 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
their 
extravagant 
error 
is 
their 
supposition 
that 
Nature 
was 
made 
for 
them 
only, 
and 
that 
they 
hold 
of 
no 
account 
what 
is 
separate 
from 
their 
person; 
whence 
they 
infer 
that 
when 
something 
unpleasing 
tothemoccurs 
all 
goesillin 
the 
universe. 


263. 
M. 
Bayle 
says 
that 
this 
observation 
of 
Maimonides 
is 
not 
to 
the 
point, 
because 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
among 
men 
evil 
exceeds 
good. 
But, 
upon 
consideration 
of 
the 
Rabbi’s 
words, 
I 
find 
that 
the 
question 
he 
formulates 
is 
general, 
and 
that 
he 
wished 
to 
refute 
those 
who 
decide 
it 
on 
one 
particular 
motive 
derived 
from 
the 
evils 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
as 
if 
all 
had 
been 
made 
for 
man; 
and 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
the 
author 
whom 
he 
refutes 
spoke 
also 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
in 
general. 
Maimonides 
is 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
if 
one 
took 
into 
account 
the 
littleness 
of 
man 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
universe 
one 
would 
comprehend 
clearly 
that 
the 
predominance 
of 
evil, 
even 
though 
it 
prevailed 
among 
men, 
need 
not 
on 
that 
account 
occur 
among 
the 
angels, 
nor 
among 
the 
heavenly 
bodies, 
nor 
among 
the 
elements 
and 
inanimate 
compounds, 
nor 
among 
many 
kinds 
of 
animals. 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere 
that 
in 
supposing 
that 
the 
number 
of 
the 
damned 
exceeds 
that 
of 
the 
saved 
(a 
supposition 
which 
is 
nevertheless 
not 
altogether 
certain) 
one 
might 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
human 
kind 
known 
to 
us. 
But 
I 
pointed 
out 
that 

that 
neither 
precludes 
the 
existence 
of 
incomparably 
more 
good 
than 
evil, 
both 
moral 
and 
physical, 
in 
rational 
creatures 
in 
general, 
nor 
prevents 
the 
city 
of 
God, 
which 
contains 
all 
creatures, 
from 
being 
the 
most 
perfect 
state. 
So 
also 
on 
consideration 
of 
the 
metaphysical 
good 
and 
evil 
which 
is 
in 
all 
substances, 
whether 
endowed 
with 
or 
devoid 
of 
intelligence, 
and 
which 
taken 
insuchscope 
wouldincludephysicalgoodandmoral 
good,onemustsaythat 
theuniverse, 
suchasitactually 
is,mustbethebestof 
allsystems. 


264. 
Moreover, 
M. 
Bayle 
will 
not 
have 
it 
that 
our 
transgression 
should 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
consideration 
of 
our 
sufferings. 
He 
is 
right 
when 
it 
is 
simply 
a 
matter 
of 
appraising 
these 
sufferings; 
but 
the 
case 
is 
not 
the 
same 
when 
one 
asks 
whether 
they 
should 
be 
ascribed 
to 
God, 
this 
indeed 
being 
the 
principal 
cause 
of 
M. 
Bayle’s 
difficulties 
when 
he 
places 
reason 
or 
experience 
in 
opposition 
to 
religion. 
I 
know 
that 
he 
is 
wont 
to 
say 
that 
it 
is 
of 
no 
avail 
to 
resort 
to 
our 
free 
will, 
since 
his 
objections 
tend 
also 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
misuse 
of 
free 
will 
must 
no 
less 
be 
laid 
to 
the 
account 
of 
God, 
who 
has 
permitted 
it 
and 
who 
has 
co-operated 
therein. 
He 
states 
it 
as 
a 
maxim 
that 
for 
one 
difficulty 
more 
or 
less 
one 
must 
not 
abandon 
a 
system. 
This 
he 
advances 
especially 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
strict 
and 
the 
dogma 
of 
the 
Supralapsarians. 
For 
he 
supposes 
that 
one 
can 
subscribe 
to 
their 
opinion, 
although 
he 
leaves 
all 
the 
difficulties 
in 
their 
entirety, 
because 
the 
other 
systems, 
albeit 
they 
put 
an 
end 
to 
some 
of 
the 
difficulties, 
cannot 
meet 
them 
all. 
I 
hold 
that 
the 
true 
system 
I 
have 
expounded 
satisfies 
all. 
Nevertheless, 
even 
were 
that 
not 
so, 
I 
confess 
that 
I 
cannot 
relish 
this 
maxim 
of 
M. 
Bayle’s, 
and 
I 
should 
prefer 
a 
system 
which 
would 
remove 
a 
great 
portion 
of 
the 
difficulties, 
to 
one 
which 
would 
meet 
none 
of 
them. 
And 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
wickedness 
of 
men, 
which 
brings 
upon 
them 
well-nigh 
all 
their 
misfortunes, 
shows 
at 
least 
that 
they 
have 
no 
right 
to 
complain. 
No 
justice 

need 
trouble 
itself 
over 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
scoundrel’s 
wickedness 
when 
it 
is 
only 
a 
question 
of 
punishing 
him: 
it 
is 
quite 
another 
matter 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
prevention. 
One 
knows 
well 
that 
disposition, 
upbringing, 
conversation, 
and 
often 
chance 
itself, 
have 
much 
share 
in 
that 
origin: 
is 
the 
man 
any 
the 
less 
deservingofpunishment? 


265. 
I 
confess 
that 
there 
still 
remains 
another 
difficulty. 
If 
God 
is 
not 
bound 
to 
account 
to 
the 
wicked 
for 
their 
wickedness, 
it 
seems 
as 
if 
he 
owes 
to 
himself, 
and 
to 
those 
who 
honour 
him 
and 
love 
him, 
justification 
for 
his 
course 
of 
action 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
permission 
of 
vice 
and 
crime. 
But 
God 
has 
alreadygiven 
that 
satisfaction, 
asfar 
as 
it 
is 
needed 
here 
on 
earth: 
bygranting 
us 
the 
light 
of 
reason 
he 
has 
bestowed 
upon 
us 
the 
means 
whereby 
we 
may 
meet 
all 
difficulties. 
I 
hope 
that 
I 
have 
made 
it 
plain 
in 
this 
discourse, 
and 
have 
elucidated 
the 
matter 
in 
the 
preceding 
portion 
of 
these 
Essays, 
almost 
as 
far 
as 
it 
can 
be 
done 
through 
general 
arguments. 
Thereafter, 
the 
permission 
of 
sin 
being 
justified, 
the 
other 
evils 
that 
are 
a 
consequence 
thereof 
present 
no 
further 
difficulty. 
Thus 
also 
Iam 
justified 
in 
restricting 
myself 
here 
tothe 
evil 
of 
guilt 
to 
account 
for 
the 
evil 
of 
punishment, 
as 
Holy 
Scripture 
does, 
and 
likewise 
well-nigh 
all 
the 
Fathers 
of 
the 
Church 
and 
the 
Preachers. 
And, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
none 
may 
say 
that 
is 
only 
good 
per 
la 
predica, 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
consider 
that, 
after 
the 
solutions 
I 
have 
given, 
nothing 
must 
seem 
more 
right 
or 
more 
exact 
than 
this 
method. 
For 
God, 
having 
found 
already 
among 
things 
possible, 
before 
his 
actual 
decrees, 
man 
misusing 
his 
freedom 
and 
bringing 
upon 
himself 
his 
misfortune, 
yet 
could 
not 
avoid 
admitting 
him 
into 
existence, 
because 
the 
general 
plan 
required 
this. 
Wherefore 
it 
will 
no 
longer 
be 
necessary 
to 
say 
with 
M. 
Jurieu 
that 
one 
must 
dogmatize 
like 
St. 
Augustineand 
preachlikePelagius. 
266. 
This 
method, 
deriving 
the 
evil 
of 
punishment 
from 
the 
evil 
of 
guilt, 
cannot 
be 
open 
to 
censure, 
and 
serves 
especially 
to 
account 
for 
the 
greatest 

physical 
evil, 
which 
is 
damnation. 
Ernst 
Sonner, 
sometime 
Professor 
of 
Philosophy 
at 
Altorf 
(a 
university 
established 
in 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
free 
city 
of 
Nuremberg), 
who 
was 
considered 
an 
excellent 
Aristotelian, 
but 
was 
finally 
recognized 
as 
being 
secretly 
a 
Socinian, 
had 
composed 
a 
little 
discourse 
entitled: 
Demonstration 
against 
the 
Eternity 
of 
Punishment. 
It 
was 
founded 
on 
this 
somewhat 
trite 
principle, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
proportion 
between 
an 
infinite 
punishment 
and 
a 
finite 
guilt. 
It 
was 
conveyed 
to 
me, 
printed 
(so 
it 
seemed) 
in 
Holland; 
and 
I 
replied 
that 
there 
was 
one 
thing 
to 
be 
considered 
which 
had 
escaped 
the 
late 
Herr 
Sonner: 
namely 
that 
it 
was 
enough 
to 
say 
that 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
guilt 
caused 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
penalty. 
Since 
the 
damnedremainedwickedtheycouldnotbewithdrawnfromtheirmisery;and 
thus 
one 
need 
not, 
in 
order 
to 
justify 
the 
continuation 
of 
their 
sufferings, 
assume 
that 
sin 
has 
become 
of 
infinite 
weight 
through 
the 
infinite 
nature 
of 
the 
object 
offended, 
who 
is 
God. 
This 
thesis 
I 
had 
not 
explored 
enough 
to 
pass 
judgement 
thereon. 
I 
know 
that 
the 
general 
opinion 
of 
the 
Schoolmen, 
according 
to 
the 
Master 
of 
the 
Sentences, 
is 
that 
in 
the 
other 
life 
there 
is 
neither 
merit 
nor 
demerit; 
but 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that, 
taken 
literally, 
it 
can 
pass 
for 
an 
article 
of 
faith. 
Herr 
Fecht, 
a 
famous 
theologian 
at 
Rostock, 
well 
refutedthat 
inhisbookon 
The 
State 
of

quite

267. 
I 
have 
observed 
that 
sundry 
able 
theologians 
have 
accounted 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
pains 
of 
the 
damned 
as 
I 
have 
just 
done. 
Johann 
Gerhard, 
a 
famous 
theologian 
of 
the 
Augsburg 
Confession 
(in 
Locis 
Theol. 
loco 
de 
Inferno, 
§ 
60), 
brings 
forward 
amongst 
other 
arguments 
that 
the 
damned 
have 
still 
an 
evil 
will 
and 
lack 
the 
grace 
that 
could 
render 
it 
good. 
Zacharias 
Ursinus, 
a 
theologian 
of 
Heidelberg, 
who 
follows 
Calvin, 
having 
formulated 

this 
question 
(in 
his 
treatise 
De 
Fide) 
why 
sin 
merits 
an 
eternal 
punishment, 
advances 
first 
the 
common 
reason, 
that 
the 
person 
offended 
is 
infinite, 
and 
then 
also 
this 
second 
reason, 
quod 
non 
cessante 
peccato 
non 
potest 
cessare 
poena. 
And 
the 
Jesuit 
Father 
Drexler 
says 
in 
his 
book 
entitled 
Nicetas, 
or 
Incontinence 
Overcome 
(book 
2, 
ch. 
11, 
§ 
9): 
‘Nec 
mirum 
damnatos 
semper 
torqueri, 
continue 
blasphemant, 
et 
sic 
quasi 
semper 
peccant, 
semper 
ergo 
plectuntur.’ 
He 
declares 
and 
approves 
the 
same 
reason 
in 
his 
work 
on 
Eternity 
(book 
2, 
ch. 
15) 
saying: 
‘Sunt 
qui 
dicant, 
nec 
displicet 
responsum: 
scelerati 
in 
locis 
infernis 
semper 
peccant, 
ideo 
semper 
puniuntur.’ 
And 
he 
indicates 
thereby 
that 
this 
opinion 
is 
very 
common 
among 
learned 
men 
in 
the 
Roman 
Church. 
He 
alleges, 
it 
is 
true, 
another 
more 
subtle 
reason, 
derived 
from 
Pope 
Gregory 
the 
Great 
(lib. 
4, 
Dial. 
c. 
44), 
that 
the 
damned 
are 
punished 
eternally 
because 
God 
foresaw 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
mediate 
knowledge 
that 
they 
would 
alwayshave 
sinned 
if 
they 
had 
always 
lived 
upon 
earth. 
Butitisa 
hypothesis 
very 
much 
open 
to 
question. 
Herr 
Fecht 
quotes 
also 
various 
eminent 
Protestant 
theologians 
for 
Herr 
Gerhard’s 
opinion, 
although

M. 
Bayle 
himself 
in 
various 
places 
has 
supplied 
me 
with 
passages 
from 
two 
able 
theologians 
of 
his 
party, 
which 
have 
some 
reference 
to 
these 
statements 
of 
mine. 
M. 
Jurieu 
in 
his 
book 
on 
the 
Unity 
of 
the 
Church, 
in 
oppositionto 
thatwritten 
by 
M. 
Nicoleon 
thesame 
subject, 
givesthe 
opinion 
() 
‘that 
reason 
tells 
us 
that 
a 
creature 
which 
cannot 
cease 
to 
be 
criminal 
can 
also 
not 
cease 
to 
be 
miserable’. 
M. 
Jacquelot 
in 
his 
book 
on 
The 
Conformity 
of 
Faith 
with 
Reason 
() 
is 
of 
opinion 
‘that 
the 
damned 
must 
remain 
eternally 
deprived 
of 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
blessed, 
and 
that 
this 
deprivation 
might 
well 
be 
the 
origin 
and 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
their 
pains, 
through 
the 
reflexions 
these 
unhappy 
creatures 
make 
upon 
their 
crimes 
which 
have 
deprived 
them 
of 
an 
eternal 
bliss. 
One 
knows 
what 
burning 
regrets, 
what 
pain 
envy 
causes 
to 

those 
who 
see 
themselves 
deprived 
of 
a 
good, 
of 
a 
notable 
honour 
which 
had 
been 
offered 
to 
them, 
and 
which 
they 
rejected, 
especially 
when 
they 
see 
others 
invested 
with 
it.’ 
This 
position 
is 
a 
little 
different 
from 
that 
of 
M. 
Jurieu, 
but 
both 
agree 
in 
this 
sentiment, 
that 
the 
damned 
are 
themselves 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
continuation 
of 
their 
torments. 
M. 
le 
Clerc’s 
Origenist 
does 
not 
entirely 
differ 
from 
this 
opinion 
when 
he 
says 
in 
the 
Select 
Library 
(vol. 
7, 
): 
‘God, 
who 
foresaw 
that 
man 
would 
fall, 
does 
not 
condemn 
him 
on 
that 
account, 
but 
only 
because, 
although 
he 
has 
the 
power 
to 
recover 
himself, 
he 
yet 
does 
not 
do 
so, 
that 
is, 
he 
freely 
retains 
his 
evil 
ways 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life.’ 
If 
he 
carries 
this 
reasoning 
on 
beyond 
this 
life, 
he 
will 
ascribe 
the 
continuationofthepainsofthewickedtothecontinuation 
oftheirguilt. 


269. 
M. 
Baylesays(Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial, 
ch. 
175,) 
‘that 
this 
dogma 
of 
the 
Origenist 
is 
heretical, 
in 
that 
it 
teaches 
that 
damnation 
is 
not 
founded 
simply 
on 
sin, 
but 
on 
voluntary 
impenitence’: 
but 
is 
not 
this 
voluntary 
impenitence 
a 
continuation 
of 
sin? 
I 
would 
not 
simply 
say, 
however, 
that 
it 
is 
because 
man, 
having 
the 
power 
to 
recover 
himself, 
does 
not; 
and 
would 
wish 
to 
add 
that 
it 
is 
because 
man 
does 
not 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
succour 
of 
grace 
to 
aid 
him 
to 
recover 
himself. 
But 
after 
this 
life, 
though 
one 
assume 
that 
the 
succour 
ceases, 
there 
is 
always 
in 
the 
man 
who 
sins, 
even 
when 
he 
is 
damned, 
a 
freedom 
which 
renders 
him 
culpable, 
and 
a 
power, 
albeit 
remote, 
of 
recovering 
himself, 
even 
though 
it 
should 
never 
pass 
into 
action. 
And 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
one 
may 
not 
say 
that 
this 
degree 
of 
freedom, 
exempt 
from 
necessity, 
but 
not 
exempt 
from 
certainty, 
remains 
in 
the 
damned 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
blessed. 
Moreover, 
the 
damned 
have 
no 
need 
of 
a 
succour 
that 
is 
needed 
in 
this 
life, 
for 
they 
know 
only 
too 
well 
what 
one 
mustbelievehere.

a 
book 
on 
the 
origin 
of

concerning 
which 
M. 
Bayle 
made 
some 

observations 
in 
the 
second 
volume 
of 
his 
Reply, 
speaks 
with 
much 
subtlety 
about 
the 
pains 
of 
the 
damned. 
This 
prelate’s 
opinion 
is 
presented 
(according 
to 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Nouvelles 
de 
la 
République 
des 
Lettres, 
June 
1703) 
as 
if 
he 
made 
‘of 
the 
damned 
just 
so 
many 
madmen 
who 
will 
feel 
their 
miseries 
acutely, 
but 
who 
will 
nevertheless 
congratulate 
themselves 
on 
their 
own 
behaviour, 
and 
who 
will 
rather 
choose 
to 
be, 
and 
to 
be 
that 
which 
they 
are, 
than 
not 
to 
be 
at 
all. 
They 
will 
love 
their 
state, 
unhappy 
as 
it 
will 
be, 
even 
as 
angry 
people, 
lovers, 
the 
ambitious, 
the 
envious 
take 
pleasure 
in 
the 
very 
things 
that 
only 
augment 
their 
misery. 
Furthermore 
the 
ungodly 
will 
have 
so 
accustomed 
their 
mind 
to 
wrong 
judgements 
that 
they 
will 
henceforth 
never 
make 
any 
other 
kind, 
and 
will 
perpetually 
pass 
from 
one 
error 
into 
another. 
They 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
refrain 
from 
desiring 
perpetually 
things 
whose 
enjoyment 
will 
be 
denied 
them, 
and, 
being 
deprived 
of 
which, 
they 
will 
fall 
into 
inconceivable 
despair, 
while 
experience 
can 
never 
make 
them 
wiser 
for 
the 
future. 
For 
by 
their 
own 
fault 
they 
will 
have 
altogether 
corrupted 
their 
understanding, 
and 
will 
have 
rendered 
it 
incapable 
of 
passing 
a 
sound 
judgementonany

Theancientsalreadyimaginedthatthe

voluntarily, 
in 
the 
midst 
of

torments, 
and 
that 
he 
is 
unwilling 
to 
redeem 
himself 
by 
an 
act 
of 
submission. 
They 
invented 
a 
tale 
that 
an 
anchorite 
in 
a 
vision 
received 
a 
promise 
from 
God 
that 
he 
would 
receive 
into 
grace 
the 
Prince 
of 
the 
bad 
angels 
if 
he 
would 
acknowledge 
his 
fault; 
but 
that 
the 
devil 
rebuffed 
this 
mediator 
in 
a 
strange 
manner. 
At 
the 
least, 
the 
theologians 
usually 
agree 
that 
the 
devils 
and 
the 
damned 
hate 
God 
and 
blaspheme 
him; 
and 
such 
a 
state 
cannot 
but 
be 
followed 
by 
continuation 
of 
misery. 
Concerning 
that, 
one 
may 
read 
the 
learned 
treatise 
of 
Herr 
Fecht 
on 
the 
State 
of 
the 
Damned. 

272. 
There 
were 
times 
when 
the 
belief 
was 
held 
that 
it 
was 
not 
impossible 
for 
a 
lost 
soul 
to 
be 
delivered. 
The 
story 
told 
of 
Pope 
Gregory 
the 
Great 
is 
well 
known, 
how 
by 
his 
prayers 
he 
had 
withdrawn 
from 
hell 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Trajan, 
whose 
goodness 
was 
so 
renowned 
that 
to 
new 
emperors 
the 
wish 
was 
offered 
that 
they 
should 
surpass 
Augustus 
in 
good 
fortune 
and 
Trajan 
in 
goodness. 
It 
was 
this 
that 
won 
for 
the 
latter 
the 
pity 
of 
the 
Holy 
Father. 
God 
acceded 
to 
hisprayers 
(itissaid), 
buthe 
forbadehimto 
makethe 
like 
prayers 
in 
future. 
According 
to 
this 
fable, 
the 
prayers 
of 
St. 
Gregory 
had 
the 
force 
of 
the 
remedies 
of 
Aesculapius, 
who 
recalled 
Hippolytus 
from 
Hades; 
and, 
if 
he 
had 
continued 
to 
make 
such 
prayers, 
God 
would 
have 
waxedwroth,likeJupiterin 
Vergil: 
At

Godescalc, 
a 
monk 
of 
the 
ninth 
century, 
who 
set 
at 
variance 
the 
theologians 
of 
his 
day, 
and 
even 
those 
of 
our 
day, 
maintained 
that 
the 
reprobate 
should 
pray 
God 
to 
render 
their 
pains 
more 
bearable; 
but 
one 
is 
never 
justified 
in 
believing 
oneself 
reprobate 
so 
long 
as 
one 
is 
alive. 
The 
passage 
in 
the 
Mass 
for 
the 
dead 
is 
more 
reasonable: 
it 
asks 
for 
the 
abatement 
of 
the 
torments 
of 
the 
damned, 
and, 
according 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
I 
have 
just 
stated, 
one 
must 
wish 
for 
them 
meliorem 
mentem. 
Origen 
having 
applied 
the 
passage 
from 
Psalm 
lxxvii, 
verse 
10: 
God 
will 
not 
forget 
to 
be 
gracious, 
neither 
will 
he 
shut 
up 
his 
loving-kindness 
in 
displeasure, 
St. 
Augustine 
replies 
(Enchirid. 
c. 
112) 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
pains 
of 
the 
damned 
last 
eternally, 
and 
that 
they 
may 
nevertheless 
be 
mitigated. 
If 
the 
text 
implied 
that, 
the 
abatement 
would, 
as 
regards 
its 
duration, 
go 
on 
to 
infinity; 
and 
yet 



that 
abatement 
would, 
as 
regards 
its 
extent, 
have 
a 
non 
plus 
ultra. 
Even 
so 
thereareasymptote 
figuresingeometrywhereaninfinitelength 
makesonly 
a 
finite 
progress 
in 
breadth. 
If 
the 
parable 
of 
the 
wicked 
rich 
man 
represented 
the 
state 
of 
a 
definitely 
lost 
soul, 
the 
hypothesis 
which 
makes 
these 
souls 
so 
mad 
and 
so 
wicked 
would 
be 
groundless. 
But 
the 
charity 
towards 
his 
brothers 
attributed 
to 
him 
in 
the 
parable 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
that 
degree 
of 
wickedness 
which 
is 
ascribed 
to 
the 
damned. 
St. 
Gregory 
the 
Great 
(IX 
Mor. 
39) 
thinks 
that 
the 
rich 
man 
was 
afraid 
lest 
their 
damnation 
should 
increase 
his: 
but 
it 
seems 
as 
thoughthis 
fear 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
consistent 
with 
the 
disposition 
of 
a 
perfectly 
wicked 
will. 
Bonaventura, 
on 
the 
Master 
of 
the 
Sentences, 
says 
that 
the 
wicked 
rich 
man 
would 
have 
desired 
to 
see 
everyone 
damned; 
but 
since 
that 
was 
not 
to 
be, 
he 
desired 
the 
salvation 
of 
his 
brothers 
rather 
than 
that 
of 
the 
rest. 
This 
reply 
is 
by 
no 
means 
sound. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
mission 
of 
Lazarus 
that 
he 
desired 
would 
have 
served 
to 
save 
many 
people; 
and 
he 
who 
takes 
so 
much 
pleasure 
in 
the 
damnation 
of 
others 
that 
he 
desires 
it 
for 
everyone 
will 
perhaps 
desire 
that 
damnation 
for 
some 
more 
than 
others; 
but, 
generally 
speaking, 
he 
will 
have 
no 
inclination 
to 
gain 
salvation 
for 
anyone. 
However 
that 
may 
be, 
one 
must 
admit 
that 
all 
this 
detail 
is 
problematical, 
God 
having 
revealed 
to 
us 
all 
that 
is 
needed 
to 
put 
us 
in 
fear 
of 
the 
greatest 
of 
misfortunes, 
and 
not 
what 
is 
needed 
for 
our 
understanding 
thereof.

we 
can 
seek 
with 
confidence 
the 
origin 
of 
evil 
in 
the 
freedom 
of 
creatures. 
The 
first 
wickedness 
is 
well 
known 
to 
us, 
it 
is 
that 
of 
the 
Devil 
and 
his 
angels: 
the 
Devil 
sinneth 
from 
the 
beginning, 
and 
for 
this 
purpose 
the 
Son 
of 
God 
was 

manifested, 
that 
he 
might 
destroy 
the 
works 
of 
the 
Devil 
(1 
John 
iii. 
8). 
The 
Devil 
is 
the 
father 
of 
wickedness, 
he 
was 
a 
murderer 
from 
the 
beginning, 
and 
abode 
notinthe 
truth(John 
viii. 
44). 
And 
thereforeGod 
spared 
notthe 
angels 
that 
sinned, 
but 
cast 
them 
down 
to 
Hell, 
and 
delivered 
them 
into 
chains 
of 
darkness, 
to 
be 
reserved 
unto 
judgement 
(2 
Pet. 
ii. 
4). 
And 
the 
angels 
which 
kept 
not 
their 
own 
habitation, 
he 
hath 
reserved 
in 
eternal 
(that 
is 
to 
say 
everlasting) 
chains 
under 
darkness 
unto 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
great 
day 
(Jude 


i. 
6). 
Whence 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
observe 
that 
one 
of 
these 
two 
letters 
must 
have 
beenseen 
bythe 
authoroftheother. 
274. 
It 
seems 
as 
if 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Apocalypse 
wished 
to 
throw 
light 
upon 
what 
the 
other 
canonical 
writers 
had 
left 
obscure: 
he 
gives 
us 
an 
account 
of 
a 
battle 
that 
took 
place 
in 
Heaven. 
Michael 
and 
his 
angels 
fought 
against 
the 
Dragon, 
and 
the 
Dragon 
fought 
and 
his 
angels. 
‘But 
they 
prevailed 
not, 
neither 
was 
their 
place 
found 
any 
more 
in 
heaven. 
And 
the 
great 
Dragon 
was 
cast 
out, 
that 
old 
serpent, 
called 
the 
Devil, 
and 
Satan, 
which 
deceiveth 
the 
whole 
world: 
and 
he 
was 
cast 
out 
into 
the 
earth, 
and 
his 
angels 
were 
cast 
out 
with 
him’ 
(Rev. 
xii. 
7, 
8, 
9). 
For 
although 
this 
account 
is 
placed 
afterthe 
flight 
of 
the 
woman 
into 
the 
wilderness,anditmayhave 
been 
intended 
to 
indicate 
thereby 
some 
revulsion 
favourable 
to 
the 
Church, 
it 
appears 
as 
though 
the 
author’s 
design 
was 
to 
show 
simultaneously 
the 
old 
fall 
ofthefirst 
enemyand 
anewfall 
ofa 
newenemy. 
275. 
Lying 
or 
wickedness 
springs 
from 
the 
Devil’s 
own 
nature, 
εκ 
των 
ιδιων 
from 
his 
will, 
because 
it 
was 
written 
in 
the 
book 
of 
the 
eternal 
verities, 
which 
contains 
the 
things 
possible 
before 
any 
decree 
of 
God, 
that 
this 
creature 
would 
freely 
turn 
toward 
evil 
if 
it 
were 
created. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
Eve 
and 
Adam; 
they 
sinned 
freely, 
albeit 
the 
Devil 
tempted 
them. 
God 
gives 
the 
wicked 
over 
to 
a 
reprobate 
mind 
(Rom. 
i. 
28), 
abandoning 
them 
to 

themselves 
and 
denying 
them 
a 
grace 
which 
he 
owes 
them 
not, 
and 
indeed 
oughttodeny 
tothem. 


276. 
It 
is 
said 
in 
the 
Scriptures 
that 
God 
hardeneth 
(Exod. 
iv. 
21 
and 
vii. 
3; 
Isa. 
lxiii. 
17); 
that 
God 
sendeth 
a 
lying 
spirit 
(1 
Kings 
xxii. 
23); 
strong 
delusion 
that 
they 
should 
believe 
a 
lie 
(2 
Thess. 
ii. 
11); 
that 
he 
deceived 
the 
prophet 
(Ezek. 
xiv. 
9); 
that 
he 
commanded 
Shimei 
to 
curse 
(2 
Sam 
xvi. 
10); 
that 
the 
children 
of 
Eli 
hearkened 
not 
unto 
the 
voice 
of 
their 
father, 
because 
the 
Lord 
would 
slay 
them 
(1 
Sam. 
ii. 
25); 
that 
the 
Lord 
took 
away 
Job’s 
substance, 
even 
although 
that 
was 
done 
through 
the 
malice 
of 
brigands 
(Job 
i. 
21); 
that 
he 
raised 
up 
Pharaoh, 
to 
show 
his 
power 
in 
him 
(Exod. 
ix. 
19; 
Rom. 
ix. 
17) 
that 
he 
is 
like 
a 
potter 
who 
maketh 
a 
vessel 
unto 
dishonour 
(Rom. 
ix. 
21); 
that 
he 
hideth 
the 
truth 
from 
the 
wise 
and 
prudent 
(Matt. 
xi. 
25); 
that 
he 
speaketh 
in 
parables 
unto 
them 
that 
are 
without, 
that 
seeing 
they 
may 
see 
and 
not 
perceive, 
and 
hearing 
they 
may 
hear 
and 
not 
understand, 
lest 
at 
any 
time 
they 
might 
be 
converted, 
and 
their 
sins 
might 
be 
forgiven 
them 
(Mark 
iv. 
12; 
Luke 
viii. 
10); 
that 
Jesus 
was 
delivered 
by 
the 
determinate 
counsel 
and 
foreknowledge 
of 
God 
(Acts 
ii. 
23); 
that 
Pontius 
Pilate 
and 
Herod 
with 
the 
Gentiles 
and 
the 
people 
of 
Israel 
did 
that 
which 
the 
hand 
and 
the 
counsel 
of 
God 
had 
determined 
before 
to 
be 
done 
(Acts 
iv. 
27, 
28); 
that 
it 
was 
of 
the 
Lord 
to 
harden 
the 
hearts 
of 
the 
enemy, 
that 
they 
should 
come 
against 
Israel 
in 
battle, 
that 
he 
might 
destroy 
them 
utterly, 
and 
that 
they 
might 
have 
no 
favour 
(Joshua 
xi. 
20); 
that 
the 
Lord 
mingled 
a 
perverse 
spirit 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
Egypt, 
and 
caused 
it 
to 
err 
in 
all 
its 
works, 
like 
a 
drunken 
man 
(Isa. 
xix. 
14); 
that 
Rehoboam 
hearkened 
not 
unto 
the 
word 
of 
the 
people, 
for 
the 
cause 
was 
from 
the 
Lord 
(1 
Kings 
xii. 
15); 
that 
he 
turned 
the 
hearts 
of 
the 
Egyptians 
to 
hate 
his 
people 
(Ps. 
cv. 
25). 
But 
all 
these 
and 
other 
like 
expressions 
suggest 
only 
that 
the 
things 
God 
has 
done 
are 
used 
as 
occasion 
for 
ignorance, 
error, 
malice 
and 
evil 
deeds, 
and 
contribute 
thereto, 
God 
indeed 
foreseeing 
this, 
and 

intending 
to 
use 
it 
for 
his 
ends, 
since 
superior 
reasons 
of 
perfect 
wisdom 
have 
determined 
him 
to 
permit 
these 
evils, 
and 
even 
to 
co-operate 
therein. 
‘Sed 
non 
sineret 
bonus 
fieri 
male, 
nisi 
omnipotens 
etiam 
de 
malo 
posset 
facere 
bene’, 
in 
St. 
Augustine’s 
words. 
But 
this 
has 
been 
expounded 
more 
fully 
in 
theprecedingpart. 


277. 
God 
made 
man 
in 
his 
image 
(Gen. 
i. 
26); 
he 
made 
him 
upright 
(Eccles. 
vii. 
29). 
But 
also 
he 
made 
him 
free. 
Man 
has 
behaved 
badly, 
he 
has 
fallen; 
but 
there 
remains 
still 
a 
certain 
freedom 
after 
the 
fall. 
Moses 
said 
as 
from 
God: 
‘I 
call 
heaven 
and 
earth 
to 
record 
this 
day 
against 
you, 
that 
I 
have 
set 
before 
you 
life 
and 
death, 
blessing 
and 
cursing; 
therefore 
choose 
life’ 
(Deut. 
xxx. 
19). 
‘Thus 
saith 
the 
Lord: 
Behold, 
I 
set 
before 
you 
the 
way 
of 
life, 
and 
the 
way 
of 
death’ 
(Jer. 
xxi. 
8). 
He 
has 
left 
man 
in 
the 
power 
of 
his 
counsel, 
giving 
him 
his 
ordinances 
and 
his 
commandments. 
‘If 
thou 
wilt, 
thou 
shalt 
keep 
the 
commandments’ 
(or 
they 
shall 
keep 
thee). 
‘He 
hath 
set 
before 
thee 
fire 
and 
water, 
to 
stretch 
forth 
thine 
hand 
to 
whichever 
thou 
wilt’ 
(Sirach 
xv. 
14, 
15, 
16). 
Fallen 
and 
unregenerate 
man 
is 
under 
the 
domination 
of 
sin 
and 
of 
Satan, 
because 
it 
pleases 
him 
so 
to 
be; 
he 
is 
a 
voluntary 
slave 
through 
his 
evil 
lust. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
free 
will 
and 
will 
in 
bondage 
are 
one 
and 
thesamething. 
278. 
‘Let 
no 
man 
say, 
I 
am 
tempted 
of 
God’; 
‘but 
every 
man 
is 
tempted, 
when 
he 
is 
drawn 
away 
of 
his 
own 
lust 
and 
enticed’ 
(Jas. 
i. 
13, 
14). 
And 
Satan 
contributes 
thereto. 
He 
‘blindeth 
the 
minds 
of 
them 
which 
believe 
not’ 
(2 
Cor. 
iv. 
4). 
But 
man 
is 
delivered 
up 
to 
the 
Devil 
by 
his 
covetous 
desire: 
the 
pleasure 
he 
finds 
in 
evil 
is 
the 
bait 
that 
hooks 
him. 
Plato 
has 
said 
so 
already, 
and 
Cicero 
repeats 
it: 
‘Plato 
voluptatem 
dicebat 
escam 
malorum.’ 
Grace 
sets 
over 
against 
it 
a 
greater 
pleasure, 
as 
St. 
Augustine 
observed. 
All 
pleasure 
is 
a 
feeling 
of 
some 
perfection; 
one 
loves 
an 
object 
in 
proportion 
as 
one 
feels 
its 
perfections; 
nothing 
surpasses 
the 
divine 
perfections. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 

charity 
and 
love 
of 
God 
give 
the 
greatest 
pleasure 
that 
can 
be 
conceived, 
in 
that 
proportion 
in 
which 
one 
is 
penetrated 
by 
these 
feelings, 
which 
are 
not 
common 
among 
men, 
busied 
and 
taken 
up 
as 
men 
are 
with 
the 
objects 
that 
areconcerned 
withtheirpassions. 


279. 
Now 
as 
our 
corruption 
is 
not 
altogether 
invincible 
and 
as 
we 
do 
not 
necessarily 
sin 
even 
when 
we 
are 
under 
the 
bondage 
of 
sin, 
it 
must 
likewise 
be 
said 
that 
we 
are 
not 
aided 
invincibly; 
and, 
however 
efficacious 
divine 
grace 
may 
be, 
there 
is 
justification 
for 
saying 
that 
one 
can 
resist 
it. 
But 
when 
it 
indeed 
proves 
victorious, 
it 
is 
certainand 
infalliblebeforehand 
thatonewill 
yield 
to 
its 
allurements, 
whether 
it 
have 
its 
strength 
of 
itself 
or 
whether 
it 
find 
a 
way 
to 
triumph 
through 
the 
congruity 
of 
circumstances. 
Thus 
one 
must 
alwaysdistinguishbetweentheinfallibleandthenecessary. 
280. 
The 
system 
of 
those 
who 
call 
themselves 
Disciples 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
is 
not 
far 
removed 
from 
this, 
provided 
one 
exclude 
certain 
obnoxious 
things, 
whether 
in 
the 
expressions 
or 
in 
the 
dogmas 
themselves. 
In 
the 
expressions 
I 
find 
that 
it 
is 
principally 
the 
use 
of 
terms 
like 
‘necessary’ 
or 
‘contingent’, 
‘possible’ 
or 
‘impossible’, 
which 
sometimes 
gives 
a 
handle 
and 
causes 
much 
ado. 
That 
is 
why, 
as 
Herr 
Löscher 
the 
younger 
aptly 
observed 
in 
a 
learned 
dissertation 
on 
the 
Paroxysms 
of 
the 
Absolute 
Decree, 
Luther 
desired, 
in 
his 
book 
On 
the 
Will 
in 
Bondage, 
to 
find 
a 
word 
more 
fitting 
for 
that 
which 
he 
wished 
to 
express 
than 
the 
word 
necessity. 
Speaking 
generally, 
it 
appears 
more 
reasonable 
and 
more 
fitting 
to 
say 
that 
obedience 
to 
God’s 
precepts 
is 
always 
possible, 
even 
for 
the 
unregenerate; 
that 
the 
grace 
of 
God 
is 
always 
resistible, 
even 
in 
those 
most 
holy, 
and 
that 
freedom 
is 
exempt 
not 
only 
from 
constraint 
but 
also 
from 
necessity, 
although 
it 
be 
never 
without 
infallible 
certainty 
or 
without 
inclining 
determination. 
281. 
Nevertheless 
there 
is 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
a 
sense 
wherein 
it 
would 
be 
permitted 
to 
say, 
in 
certain 
conjunctures, 
that 
the 
power 
to 
do 
good 
is 
often 

lacking, 
even 
in 
the 
just; 
that 
sins 
are 
often 
necessary, 
even 
in 
the 
regenerate; 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
sometimes 
for 
one 
not 
to 
sin; 
that 
grace 
is 
irresistible; 
that 
freedom 
is 
not 
exempt 
from 
necessity. 
But 
these 
expressions 
are 
less 
exact 
and 
less 
pleasing 
in 
the 
circumstances 
that 
prevail 
about 
us 
to-day. 
They 
are 
also 
in 
general 
more 
open 
to 
misuse; 
and 
moreover 
they 
savour 
somewhat 
of 
the 
speech 
of 
the 
people, 
where 
terms 
are 
employed 
with 
great 
latitude. 
There 
are, 
however, 
circumstances 
which 
render 
them 
acceptable 
and 
even 
serviceable. 
It 
is 
the 
case 
that 
sacred 
and 
orthodox 
writers, 
and 
even 
the 
holy 
Scriptures, 
have 
made 
use 
of 
expressions 
on 
both 
sides, 
and 
no 
real 
contradiction 
has 
arisen, 
any 
more 
than 
between 
St. 
Paul 
and 
St. 
James, 
or 
any 
error 
on 
either 
side 
that 
might 
be 
attributable 
to 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
terms. 
Oneissowell 
accustomed 
to 
these 
various 
ways 
of 
speaking 
that 
often 
one 
is 
put 
to 
it 
to 
say 
precisely 
which 
sense 
is 
the 
more 
ordinary 
and 
the 
more 
natural, 
and 
even 
that 
more 
intended 
by 
the 
author 
(quis 
sensus 
magis 
naturalis, 
obvius, 
intentus). 
For 
the 
same 
writer 
has 
different 
aims 
in 
different 
passages, 
and 
the 
same 
ways 
of 
speaking 
are 
more 
or 
less 
accepted 
or 
acceptable 
before 
or 
after 
the 
decision 
of 
some 
great 
man 
or 
of 
some 
authority 
that 
one 
respects 
and 
follows. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
this 
one 
may 
well 
authorize 
or 
ban, 
as 
opportunity 
arises 
and 
at 
certain 
times, 
certain 
expressions; 
but 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
to 
the 
sense, 
or 
to 
the 
content 
of 
faith, 
if 
sufficient 
explanationsof 
the 
termsarenotadded. 


282. 
It 
is 
therefore 
only 
necessary 
to 
understand 
fully 
some 
distinctions, 
such 
as 
that 
I 
have 
very 
often 
urged 
between 
the 
necessary 
and 
the 
certain, 
and 
between 
metaphysical 
necessity 
and 
moral 
necessity. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
possibility 
and 
impossibility, 
since 
the 
event 
whose 
opposite 
is 
possible 
is 
contingent, 
even 
as 
that 
whose 
opposite 
is 
impossible 
is 
necessary. 
A 
distinction 
is 
rightly 
drawn 
also 
between 
a 
proximate 
potency 
and 
a 
remote 
potency; 
and, 
according 
to 
these 
different 
senses, 
one 
says 
now 
that 
a 
thing 

may 
be 
and 
now 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
blessed 
should 
not 
sin; 
that 
the 
devils 
and 
the 
damned 
should 
sin; 
that 
God 
himself 
should 
choose 
the 
best; 
that 
man 
should 
follow 
the 
course 
which 
after 
all 
attracts 
him 
most. 
But 
this 
necessity 
is 
not 
opposed 
to 
contingency; 
it 
is 
not 
of 
the 
kind 
called 
logical, 
geometrical 
or 
metaphysical, 
whose 
opposite 
implies 
contradiction. 
M. 
Nicole 
has 
made 
use 
somewhere 
of 
a 
comparison 
which 
is 
not 
amiss. 
It 
is 
considered 
impossible 
that 
a 
wise 
and 
serious 
magistrate, 
who 
has 
not 
taken 
leave 
of 
his 
senses, 
should 
publicly 
commit 
some 
outrageous 
action, 
as 
it 
would 
be, 
for 
instance, 
to 
run 
about 
the 
streets 
naked 
in 
order 
to 
make 
people 
laugh. 
It 
is 
the 
same, 
in 
a 
sense, 
with 
the 
blessed; 
they 
are 
still 
less 
capable 
of 
sinning, 
and 
the 
necessity 
that 
forbids 
them 
to 
sin 
is 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
Finally 
I 
also 
hold 
that 
‘will’ 
is 
a 
term 
as 
equivocal 
as 
potency 
and 
necessity. 
For 
I 
have 
already 
observed 
that 
those 
who 
employ 
this 
axiom, 
that 
one 
does 
not 
fail 
to 
do 
what 
one 
wills 
when 
one 
can, 
and 
who 
thence 
infer 
that 
God 
therefore 
does 
not 
will 
the 
salvation 
of 
all, 
imply 
a 
decretory 
will. 
Only 
in 
that 
sense 
can 
one 
support 
this 
proposition, 
that 
wisdom 
never 
wills 
what 
it 
knows 
to 
be 
among 
the 
things 
that 
shall 
not 
happen. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
one 
may 
say, 
taking 
will 
in 
a 
sense 
more 
general 
and 
more 
in 
conformity 
with 
customary 
use, 
that 
the 
wisewillis 
inclined 
antecedently 
to 
all 
good, 
although 
it 
decrees 
finally 
to 
do 
that 
which 
is 
most 
fitting. 
Thus 
one 
would 
be 
very 
wrong 
to 
deny 
to 
God 
the 
serious 
and 
strong 
inclinationtosaveall 
men, 
which 
Holy 
Scripture 
attributes 
to 
him; 
or 
even 
to 
attribute 
to 
him 
an 
original 
distaste 
which 
diverts 
him 
from 
the 
salvation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
persons, 
odium 
antecedaneum. 
One 
should 
rather 
maintain 
that 
the 
wise 
mind 
tends 
towards 
all 
good, 
as 
good, 
in 
proportion 
to 
his 
knowledge 
and 
his 
power, 
but 
that 
he 
only 
produces 
the 
best 
that 
can 
be 
achieved. 
Those 
who 
admit 
that, 
and 
yet 
deny 
to 
God 
the 
antecedent 
will 
to 
save 
all 
men, 
are 
wrong 
only 
in 
their 
misuse 
of 
the 
term, 



provided 
that 
they 
acknowledge, 
besides, 
that 
God 
gives 
to 
all 
help 
sufficient 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
win 
salvation 
if 
only 
they 
have 
the 
will 
to 
avail 
themselves 
thereof. 


283. 
In 
the 
dogmas 
themselves 
held 
by 
the 
Disciples 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
I 
cannot 
approve 
the 
damnation 
of 
unregenerate 
children, 
nor 
in 
general 
damnation 
resulting 
from 
original 
sin 
alone. 
Nor 
can 
I 
believe 
that 
God 
condemns 
those 
who 
are 
without 
the 
necessary 
light. 
One 
may 
believe, 
with 
many 
theologians, 
that 
men 
receive 
more 
aid 
than 
we 
are 
aware 
of, 
were 
it 
only 
when 
they 
are 
at 
the 
point 
of 
death. 
It 
does 
not 
appear 
necessary 
either 
that 
all 
those 
who 
are 
saved 
should 
always 
be 
saved 
through 
a 
grace 
efficacious 
of 
itself, 
independently 
of 
circumstances. 
Also 
I 
consider 
it 
unnecessary 
to 
say 
that 
all 
the 
virtues 
of 
the 
pagans 
were 
false 
or 
that 
all 
their 
actions 
were 
sins; 
though 
it 
be 
true 
that 
what 
does 
not 
spring 
from 
faith, 
or 
from 
the 
uprightness 
of 
the 
soul 
before 
God, 
is 
infected 
with 
sin, 
at 
least 
virtually. 
Finally 
I 
hold 
that 
God 
cannot 
act 
as 
if 
at 
random 
by 
an 
absolutely 
absolute 
decree, 
or 
by 
a 
will 
independent 
of 
reasonable 
motives. 
And 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
he 
is 
always 
actuated, 
in 
the 
dispensation 
of 
his 
grace, 
by 
reasons 
wherein 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
objects 
participates. 
Otherwise 
he 
would 
not 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
wisdom. 
I 
grant 
nevertheless 
that 
these 
reasons 
are 
not 
of 
necessity 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
good 
or 
the 
less 
evil 
natural 
qualities 
of 
men, 
as 
if 
God 
gave 
his 
grace 
only 
according 
to 
these 
good 
qualities. 
Yet 
I 
hold, 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
already 
here, 
that 
these 
qualities 
are 
taken 
into 
consideration 
like 
all 
the 
other 
circumstances, 
since 
nothing 
can 
be 
neglected 
inthedesignsofsupremewisdom. 
284. 
Save 
for 
these 
points, 
and 
some 
few 
others, 
where 
St. 
Augustine 
appears 
obscure 
or 
even 
repellent, 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
one 
can 
conform 
to 
his 
system. 
He 
states 
that 
from 
the 
substance 
of 
God 
only 
a 
God 
can 
proceed, 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
creature 
is 
derived 
from 
nothingness 
(Augustine 
De 
Lib. 

Arb. 
lib. 
1, 
c. 
2). 
That 
is 
what 
makes 
the 
creature 
imperfect, 
faulty 
and 
corruptible 
(De 
Genesi 
ad 
Lit. 
c. 
15, 
Contra 
Epistolam 
Manichaei, 
c. 
36). 
Evil 
comes 
not 
from 
nature, 
but 
from 
evil 
will 
(Augustine, 
in 
the 
whole 
book 
On 
the 
Nature 
of 
Good). 
God 
can 
command 
nothing 
that 
would 
be 
impossible. 
‘Firmissime 
creditur 
Deum 
justum 
et 
bonum 
impossibilia 
non 
potuisse 
praecipere’ 
(Lib. 
de 
Nat. 
et 
Grat. 
c. 
43, 
). 
Nemo 
peccat 
in 
eo, 
quod 
caveri 
non 
potest 
(lib. 
3, 
De 
Lib. 
Arb. 
c. 
16, 
17, 
lib. 
1 
Retract. 
c. 
11, 
13, 
15). 
Under 
a 
just 
God, 
none 
can 
be 
unhappy 
who 
deserves 
not 
so 
to 
be, 
‘neque 
sub 
Deo 
justo 
miser 
esse 
quisquam, 
nisi 
mereatur, 
potest’ 
(lib. 
1, 
c. 
39). 
Free 
willcannotcarry 
out 
God’scommandswithouttheaidofgrace(Ep. 
ad 
Hilar. 
Caesaraugustan.). 
We 
know 
that 
grace 
is 
not 
given 
according 
to 
deserts 
(E, 
107, 
120). 
Man 
in 
the 
state 
of 
innocence 
had 
the 
aid 
necessary 
to 
enable 
him 
to 
do 
good 
if 
he 
wished; 
but 
the 
wish 
depended 
on 
free 
will, 
‘habebat 
adjutorium, 
per 
quod 
posset, 
et 
sine 
quo 
non 
vellet, 
sed 
non 
adjutorium 
quo 
vellet’ 
(Lib. 
de 
Corrept. 
c. 
11 
et 
c. 
10, 
12). 
God 
let 
angels 
and 
men 
try 
what 
they 
could 
do 
by 
their 
free 
will, 
and 
after 
that 
what 
his 
grace 
and 
his 
justice 
could 
achieve 
(ibid. 
c. 
10, 
11, 
12). 
Sin 
turned 
man 
away 
from 
God, 
to 
turn 
him 
towards 
creatures 
(lib. 
1, 
qu. 
2, 
Ad 
Simplicium). 
To 
take 
pleasure 
in 
sinningisthe 
freedomof 
aslave(Enchirid. 
c. 
103). 
‘Liberumarbitriumusque 
adeo 
in 
peccatore 
non 
periit, 
ut 
per 
illud 
peccent 
maxime 
omnes, 
qui 
cum 
delectationepeccant’ 
(lib. 
1, 
Ad 
Bonifac. 
c. 
2,3). 


285. 
God 
said 
to 
Moses: 
‘I 
will 
be 
gracious 
to 
whom 
I 
will 
be 
gracious, 
and 
will 
shew 
mercy 
on 
whom 
I 
will 
shew 
mercy’ 
(Exod. 
xxxiii. 
19). 
‘So 
then 
it 
is 
not 
of 
him 
that 
willeth, 
nor 
of 
him 
that 
runneth, 
but 
of 
God 
that 
sheweth 
mercy’ 
(Rom. 
ix. 
15, 
16). 
That 
does 
not 
prevent 
all 
those 
who 
have 
good 
will, 
and 
who 
persevere 
therein, 
from 
being 
saved. 
But 
God 
gives 
them 
the 
willing 
and 
the 
doing. 
‘Therefore 
hath 
he 
mercy 
on 
whom 
he 
will 
have 
mercy, 
and 
whom 
he 
will 
he 
hardeneth’ 
(Rom. 
ix. 
18). 
And 
yet 
the 
same 

Apostle 
says 
that 
God 
willeth 
that 
all 
men 
should 
be 
saved, 
and 
come 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth; 
which 
I 
would 
not 
interpret 
in 
accordance 
with 
some 
passages 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
as 
if 
it 
signified 
that 
no 
men 
are 
saved 
except 
those 
whose 
salvation 
he 
wills, 
or 
as 
if 
he 
would 
save 
non 
singulos 
generum, 
sed 
genera 
singulorum. 
But 
I 
would 
rather 
say 
that 
there 
is 
none 
whose 
salvation 
he 
willeth 
not, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
this 
is 
permitted 
by 
greater 
reasons. 
For 
these 
bring 
it 
about 
that 
God 
only 
saves 
those 
who 
accept 
the 
faith 
he 
has 
offered 
to 
them 
and 
who 
surrender 
themselves 
thereto 
by 
the 
grace 
he 
has 
given 
them, 
in 
accordance 
with 
what 
was 
consistent 
with 
the 
plan 
of 
his 
works 
initsentirety,thanwhichnone 
canbe 
betterconceived. 


286. 
As 
for 
predestination 
to 
salvation, 
it 
includes 
also, 
according 
to 
St. 
Augustine, 
the 
ordinance 
of 
the 
means 
that 
shall 
lead 
to 
salvation. 
‘Praedestinatio 
sanctorum 
nihil 
aliud 
est, 
quam 
praescientia 
et 
praeparatio 
beneficiorum 
Dei, 
quibus 
certissime 
liberantur 
quicunque 
liberantur’ 
(Lib. 
de 
Persev. 
c. 
14). 
He 
does 
not 
then 
understand 
it 
there 
as 
an 
absolute 
decree; 
he 
maintains 
that 
there 
is 
a 
grace 
which 
is 
not 
rejected 
by 
any 
hardened 
heart, 
because 
it 
is 
given 
in 
order 
to 
remove 
especially 
the 
hardness 
of 
hearts 
(Lib. 
de 
Praedest. 
c. 
8; 
Lib. 
de 
Grat. 
c. 
13, 
14). 
I 
do 
not 
find, 
however, 
that 
St. 
Augustine 
conveys 
sufficiently 
that 
this 
grace, 
which 
subdues 
the 
heart, 
is 
always 
efficacious 
of 
itself. 
And 
one 
might 
perhaps 
have 
asserted 
without 
offence 
to 
him 
that 
the 
same 
degree 
of 
inward 
grace 
is 
victorious 
in 
the 
one, 
where 
itis 
aided 
byoutwardcircumstances, 
but 
not 
intheother. 
287. 
Will 
is 
proportionate 
to 
the 
sense 
we 
have 
of 
the 
good, 
and 
follows 
the 
sense 
which 
prevails. 
‘Si 
utrumque 
tantundem 
diligimus, 
nihil 
horum 
dabimus. 
Item: 
Quod 
amplius 
nos 
delectat, 
secundum 
id 
operemur 
necesse 
est’ 
(in 
c. 
5, 
Ad 
Gal.). 
I 
have 
explained 
already 
how, 
despite 
all 
that, 
we 
have 
indeed 
a 
great 
power 
over 
our 
will. 
St. 
Augustine 
takes 
it 
somewhat 
differently, 
and 
in 
a 
way 
that 
does 
not 
go 
far, 
when 
he 
says 
that 
nothing 
is 
so 

much 
within 
our 
power 
as 
the 
action 
of 
our 
will. 
And 
he 
gives 
a 
reason 
which 
is 
almost 
tautological: 
for 
(he 
says) 
this 
action 
is 
ready 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
we 
will. 
‘Nihil 
tam 
in 
nostra 
potestate 
est, 
quam 
ipsa 
voluntas, 
ea 
enim 
mox 
ut 
volumus 
praesto 
est’ 
(lib. 
3, 
De 
Lib. 
Arb. 
c. 
3; 
lib. 
5, 
De 
Civ. 
Dei, 
c. 
10). 
But 
that 
only 
means 
that 
we 
will 
when 
we 
will, 
and 
not 
that 
we 
will 
that 
which 
we 
wish 
to 
will. 
There 
is 
more 
reason 
for 
saying 
with 
him: 
‘aut 
voluntas 
non 
est, 
aut 
libera 
dicenda 
est’ 
(d. 
1, 
3, 
c. 
3); 
and 
that 
what 
inclines 
the 
will 
towards 
good 
infallibly, 
or 
certainly, 
does 
not 
prevent 
it 
from 
being 
free. 
‘Perquam 
absurdum 
est, 
ut 
ideo 
dicamus 
non 
pertinere 
ad 
voluntatem 
[libertatem] 
nostram, 
quod 
beati 
esse 
volumus, 
quia 
id 
omnino 
nolle 
non 
possumus, 
nescio 
qua 
bona 
constrictione 
naturae. 
Nec 
dicere 
audemus 
ideo 
Deum 
non 
voluntatem 
[libertatem], 
sed 
necessitatem 
habere 
justitiae, 
quia 
non 
potest 
velle 
peccare. 
Certe 
Deus 
ipse 
numquid 
quia 
peccare 
non 
potest, 
ideo 
liberum 
arbitrium 
habere 
negandus 
est?’ 
(De 
Nat. 
et 
Grat. 
c. 
46, 
47, 
48, 
49). 
He 
also 
says 
aptly, 
that 
God 
gives 
the 
first 
good 
impulse, 
but 
that 
afterwards 
man 
acts 
also. 
‘Aguntur 
ut 
agant, 
non 
ut 
ipsi 
nihil 
agant’ 
(De 
Corrept. 
c. 
2). 


288. 
I 
have 
proved 
that 
free 
will 
is 
the 
proximate 
cause 
of 
the 
evil 
of 
guilt, 
and 
consequently 
of 
the 
evil 
of 
punishment; 
although 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
original 
imperfection 
of 
creatures, 
which 
is 
already 
presented 
in 
the 
eternal 
ideas, 
is 
the 
first 
and 
most 
remote 
cause. 
M. 
Bayle 
nevertheless 
always 
disputes 
this 
use 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
free 
will; 
he 
will 
not 
have 
the 
cause 
of 
evil 
ascribed 
to 
it. 
One 
must 
listen 
to 
his 
objections, 
but 
first 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
throw 
further 
light 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
freedom. 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
freedom, 
according 
to 
the 
definition 
required 
in 
the 
schools 
of 
theology, 
consists 
in 
intelligence, 
which 
involves 
a 
clear 
knowledge 
of 
the 
object 
of 
deliberation, 
in 
spontaneity, 
whereby 
we 
determine, 
and 
in 
contingency, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
exclusion 
of 
logical 
or 
metaphysical 
necessity. 
Intelligence 
is, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 

soul 
of 
freedom, 
and 
therest 
is 
asits 
body 
and 
foundation. 
The 
free 
substance 
is 
self-determining 
and 
that 
according 
to 
the 
motive 
of 
good 
perceived 
by 
the 
understanding, 
which 
inclines 
it 
without 
compelling 
it: 
and 
all 
the 
conditions 
of 
freedom 
are 
comprised 
in 
these 
few 
words. 
It 
is 
nevertheless 
well 
to 
point 
out 
that 
the 
imperfection 
present 
in 
our 
knowledge 
and 
our 
spontaneity, 
and 
the 
infallible 
determination 
that 
is 
involved 
in 
our 
contingency, 
destroy 
neitherfreedomnor 
contingency. 


289. 
Our 
knowledge 
is 
of 
two 
kinds, 
distinct 
or 
confused. 
Distinct 
knowledge, 
or 
intelligence, 
occurs 
in 
the 
actual 
use 
of 
reason; 
but 
the 
senses 
supply 
us 
with 
confused 
thoughts. 
And 
we 
may 
say 
that 
we 
are 
immune 
from 
bondage 
in 
so 
far 
as 
we 
act 
with 
a 
distinct 
knowledge, 
but 
that 
we 
are 
the 
slaves 
of 
passion 
in 
so 
far 
as 
our 
perceptions 
are 
confused. 
In 
this 
sense 
we 
have 
not 
all 
the 
freedom 
of 
spirit 
that 
were 
to 
be 
desired, 
and 
we 
may 
say 
with 
St. 
Augustine 
that 
being 
subject 
to 
sin 
we 
have 
the 
freedom 
of 
a 
slave. 
Yet 
a 
slave, 
slave 
as 
he 
is, 
nevertheless 
has 
freedom 
to 
choose 
according 
to 
the 
state 
wherein 
he 
is, 
although 
more 
often 
than 
not 
he 
is 
under 
the 
stern 
necessity 
of 
choosing 
between 
two 
evils, 
because 
a 
superior 
force 
prevents 
him 
from 
attaining 
the 
goods 
whereto 
he 
aspires. 
That 
which 
in 
a 
slave 
is 
effected 
by 
bonds 
andconstraint 
in 
us 
is 
effected 
by 
passions, 
whose 
violence 
is 
sweet, 
but 
none 
the 
less 
pernicious. 
In 
truth 
we 
will 
only 
that 
which 
pleases 
us: 
but 
unhappily 
what 
pleases 
us 
now 
is 
often 
a 
real 
evil, 
which 
would 
displease 
us 
if 
we 
had 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
understanding 
open. 
Nevertheless 
that 
evil 
state 
of 
the 
slave, 
which 
is 
also 
our 
own, 
does 
not 
prevent 
us, 
any 
more 
than 
him, 
from 
making 
a 
free 
choice 
of 
that 
which 
pleases 
us 
most, 
in 
the 
state 
to 
which 
we 
are 
reduced, 
in 
proportion 
to 
our 
present 
strength 
and 
knowledge. 
290. 
As 
for 
spontaneity, 
it 
belongs 
to 
us 
in 
so 
far 
as 
we 
have 
within 
us 
the 
source 
of 
our 
actions, 
as 
Aristotle 
rightly 
conceived. 
The 
impressions 
of 

external 
things 
often, 
indeed, 
divert 
us 
from 
our 
path, 
and 
it 
was 
commonly 
believed 
that, 
at 
least 
in 
this 
respect, 
some 
of 
the 
sources 
of 
our 
actions 
were 
outside 
ourselves. 
I 
admit 
that 
one 
is 
bound 
to 
speak 
thus, 
adapting 
oneself 
to 
the 
popular 
mode 
of 
expression, 
as 
one 
may, 
in 
a 
certain 
sense, 
without 
doing 
violence 
to 
truth. 
But 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
expressing 
oneself 
accurately 
I 
maintain 
that 
our 
spontaneity 
suffers 
no 
exception 
and 
that 
external 
things 
havenophysicalinfluenceuponus,Imeaninthestrictlyphilosophicalsense. 


291. 
For 
better 
understanding 
of 
this 
point, 
one 
must 
know 
that 
true 
spontaneity 
is 
common 
to 
us 
and 
all 
simple 
substances, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
intelligent 
or 
free 
substance 
this 
becomes 
a 
mastery 
over 
its 
actions. 
That 
cannot 
be 
better 
explained 
than 
by 
the 
System 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
which 
I 
indeed 
propounded 
some 
years 
ago. 
There 
I 
pointed 
out 
that 
by 
nature 
every 
simple 
substance 
has 
perception, 
and 
that 
its 
individuality 
consists 
in 
the 
perpetual 
law 
which 
brings 
about 
the 
sequence 
of 
perceptions 
that 
are 
assigned 
to 
it, 
springing 
naturally 
from 
one 
another, 
to 
represent 
the 
body 
that 
is 
allotted 
to 
it, 
and 
through 
its 
instrumentality 
the 
entire 
universe, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
point 
of 
view 
proper 
to 
this 
simple 
substance 
and 
without 
its 
needing 
to 
receive 
any 
physical 
influence 
from 
the 
body. 
Even 
so 
the 
body 
also 
for 
its 
part 
adapts 
itself 
to 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
soul 
by 
its 
own 
laws, 
and 
consequently 
only 
obeys 
it 
according 
to 
the 
promptings 
of 
these 
laws. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
soul 
has 
in 
itself 
a 
perfect 
spontaneity, 
so 
that 
itdependsonlyupon 
Godanduponitselfinits 
actions. 
292. 
As 
this 
system 
was 
not 
known 
formerly, 
other 
ways 
were 
sought 
for 
emerging 
from 
this 
labyrinth, 
and 
the 
Cartesians 
themselves 
were 
in 
difficulties 
over 
the 
subject 
of 
free 
will. 
They 
were 
no 
longer 
satisfied 
by 
the 
‘faculties’ 
of 
the 
Schoolmen, 
and 
they 
considered 
that 
all 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
soul 
appear 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
what 
comes 
from 
without, 
according 
to 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
that, 
ultimately, 
all 
is 
controlled 
in 
the 

universe 
by 
the 
providence 
of 
God. 
Thence 
arose 
naturally 
the 
objection 
that 
there 
is 
therefore 
no 
freedom. 
To 
that 
M. 
Descartes 
replied 
that 
we 
are 
assured 
of 
God’s 
providence 
by 
reason; 
but 
that 
we 
are 
likewise 
assured 
of 
ourfreedomby 
experience 
thereof 
within 
ourselves;and 
that 
wemust 
believe 
inboth,eventhough 
we 
seenothowitispossibletoreconcilethem. 


293. 
That 
was 
cutting 
the 
Gordian 
knot, 
and 
answering 
the 
conclusion 
of 
an 
argument 
not 
by 
refuting 
it 
but 
by 
opposing 
thereto 
a 
contrary 
argument. 
Which 
procedure 
does 
not 
conform 
to 
the 
laws 
for 
philosophical 
disputes. 
Notwithstanding, 
most 
of 
the 
Cartesians 
contented 
themselves 
with 
this, 
albeit 
the 
inward 
experience 
they 
adduce 
does 
not 
prove 
their 
assertion, 
as 
M. 
Bayle 
has 
clearly 
shown. 
M. 
Regis 
(Philos. 
vol. 
1, 
Metaph. 
book 
2, 
part 
2, 
c. 
22) 
thus 
paraphrases 
M. 
Descartes’ 
doctrine: 
‘Most 
philosophers’, 
he 
says, 
‘have 
fallen 
into 
error. 
Some, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
understand 
the 
relation 
existing 
between 
free 
actions 
and 
the 
providence 
of 
God, 
have 
denied 
that 
God 
was 
the 
first 
efficient 
cause 
of 
free 
will: 
but 
that 
is 
sacrilegious. 
The 
others, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
apprehend 
the 
relation 
between 
God’s 
efficacy 
and 
free 
actions, 
have 
denied 
that 
man 
was 
endowed 
with 
freedom: 
and 
that 
is 
a 
blasphemy. 
The 
mean 
to 
be 
found 
between 
these 
two 
extremes 
is 
to 
say’ 
(id. 
ibid. 
) 
‘that, 
even 
though 
we 
were 
not 
able 
to 
understand 
all 
the 
relations 
existing 
between 
freedom 
and 
God’s 
providence, 
we 
should 
nevertheless 
be 
bound 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
we 
are 
free 
and 
dependent 
upon 
God. 
For 
both 
these 
truths 
are 
equally 
known, 
the 
one 
through 
experience, 
and 
the 
other 
through 
reason; 
and 
prudence 
forbids 
one 
to 
abandon 
truths 
whereof 
one 
is 
assured, 
under 
the 
pretext 
that 
one 
cannot 
apprehend 
all 
the 
relations 
existing 
between 
them 
andothertruthswellknown.’ 
294. 
M. 
Bayle 
here 
remarks 
pertinently 
in 
the 
margin, 
‘that 
these 
expressions 
of 
M. 
Regis 
fail 
to 
point 
out 
that 
we 
are 
aware 
of 
relations 

between 
man’s 
actions 
and 
God’s 
providence, 
such 
as 
appear 
to 
us 
to 
be 
incompatible 
with 
our 
freedom.’ 
He 
adds 
that 
these 
expressions 
are 
over-
circumspect, 
weakening 
the 
statement 
of 
the 
problem. 
‘Authors 
assume’, 
he 
says, 
‘thatthedifficultyarises 
solelyfromourlack 
ofenlightenment; 
whereas 
they 
ought 
to 
say 
that 
it 
arises 
in 
the 
main 
from 
the 
enlightenment 
which 
we 
have, 
and 
cannot 
reconcile’ 
(in 
M. 
Bayle’s 
opinion) 
‘with 
our 
Mysteries.’ 
That 
is 
exactly 
what 
I 
said 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
work, 
that 
if 
the 
Mysteries 
were 
irreconcilable 
with 
reason, 
and 
if 
there 
were 
unanswerable 
objections, 
far 
from 
finding 
the 
mystery 
incomprehensible, 
we 
should 
comprehend 
that 
it 
was 
false. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
here 
there 
is 
no 
question 
of 
a 
mystery, 
but 
only 
of 
naturalreligion. 


295. 
This 
is 
how 
M. 
Bayle 
combats 
those 
inward 
experiences, 
whereon 
the 
Cartesians 
make 
freedom 
rest: 
but 
he 
begins 
by 
reflexions 
with 
which 
I 
cannot 
agree. 
‘Those 
who 
do 
not 
make 
profound 
examination’, 
he 
says 
(Dictionary, 
art. 
‘Helen.’, 
lit. 
ΤΔ), 
‘of 
that 
which 
passes 
within 
them 
easily 
persuade 
themselves 
that 
they 
are 
free, 
and 
that, 
if 
their 
will 
prompts 
them 
to 
evil,itistheirfault, 
itis 
through 
achoice 
whereofthey 
are 
themasters. 
Those 
who 
judge 
otherwise 
are 
persons 
who 
have 
studied 
with 
care 
the 
springs 
and 
the 
circumstances 
of 
their 
actions, 
and 
who 
have 
thought 
over 
the 
progress 
of 
their 
soul’s 
impulses. 
Those 
persons 
usually 
have 
doubts 
abouttheir 
free 
will, 
and 
even 
come 
to 
persuade 
themselves 
that 
their 
reason 
and 
mind 
are 
slaves, 
without 
power 
to 
resist 
the 
force 
that 
carries 
them 
along 
where 
they 
would 
not 
go. 
It 
was 
principally 
persons 
of 
this 
kind 
who 
ascribed 
to 
the 
gods 
the 
causeoftheirevildeeds.’ 
296. 
These 
words 
remind 
me 
of 
those 
of 
Chancellor 
Bacon, 
who 
says 
that 
a 
little 
philosophy 
inclineth 
us 
away 
from 
God, 
but 
that 
depth 
in 
philosophy 
bringeth 
men’s 
minds 
about 
to 
him. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
those 
who 
reflect 
upon 
their 
actions: 
it 
appears 
to 
them 
at 
first 
that 
all 
we 
do 
is 
only 
impulsion 

from 
others, 
and 
that 
all 
we 
apprehend 
comes 
from 
without 
through 
the 
senses, 
and 
is 
traced 
upon 
the 
void 
of 
our 
mind 
tanquam 
in 
tabula 
rasa. 
But 
more 
profound 
meditation 
shows 
us 
that 
all 
(even 
perceptions 
and 
passions) 
comestousfromourown 
innerbeing,withcompletespontaneity. 


297. 
Yet 
M. 
Bayle 
cites 
poets 
who 
pretend 
to 
exonerate 
men 
by 
laying 
the 
blame 
uponthe 
gods. 
Medea

298. 
Herr 
Wittich 
seems 
to 
have 
thought 
that 
in 
reality 
our 
independence 
is 
only 
apparent. 
For 
in 
his 
Diss. 
de 
providentia 
Dei 
actuali 
(n. 
61) 
he 
makes 
free 
will 
consist 
in 
our 
being 
inclined 
towards 
the 
objects 
that 
present 
themselves 
to 
our 
soul 
for 
affirmation 
or 
denial, 
love 
or 
hate, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
we 
do 
not 
feel 
we 
are 
being 
determined 
by 
any 
outward 
force. 
He 
adds 
that 
it 
is 
when 
God 
himself 
causes 
our 
volitions 
that 
we 
act 
with 
most 
freedom; 
and 
that 
the 
more 
efficacious 
and 
powerful 
God’s 
action 
is 
upon 
us, 
the 
more 
we 
are 
masters 
of 
our 
actions. 
‘Quia 
enim 
Deus 
operatur 
ipsum 
velle, 
quo 
efficacius 
operatur, 
eo 
magis 
volumus; 
quod 
autem, 
cum 
volumus, 
facimus, 
id 
maxime 
habemus 
in 
nostra 
potestate.’ 
It 
is 
true 
that 
when 
God 
causes 
a 
volition 
in 
us 
he 
causes 
a 
free 
action. 
But 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
question 
here 
is 
not 
of 
the 
universal 
cause 
or 
of 
that 
production 
of 
our 
will 

which 
is 
proper 
to 
it 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
a 
created 
effect, 
whose 
positive 
elements 
are 
actually 
created 
continually 
through 
God’s 
co-operation, 
like 
all 
other 
absolute 
reality 
of 
things. 
We 
are 
concerned 
here 
with 
the 
reasons 
for 
willing, 
and 
the 
means 
God 
uses 
when 
he 
gives 
us 
a 
good 
will 
or 
permits 
us 
to 
have 
an 
evil 
will. 
It 
is 
always 
we 
who 
produce 
it, 
good 
or 
evil, 
for 
it 
is 
our 
action: 
but 
there 
are 
always 
reasons 
that 
make 
us 
act, 
without 
impairing 
either 
our 
spontaneity 
or 
our 
freedom. 
Grace 
does 
no 
more 
than 
give 
impressions 
which 
are 
conducive 
to 
making 
will 
operate 
through 
fitting 
motives, 
such 
as 
would 
be 
an 
attention, 
a 
dic 
cur 
hic, 
a 
prevenient 
pleasure. 
And 
it 
is 
quite 
evident 
that 
that 
does 
not 
interfere 
with 
freedom, 
any 
more 
than 
could 
a 
friend 
who 
gives 
counsel 
and 
furnishes 
motives. 
Thus 
Herr 
Wittich 
has 
not 
supplied 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question, 
any 
more 
than 
M. 
Bayle, 
and 
recourse 
to 
God 
is 
of 
no 
availhere. 


299. 
Butletme 
giveanothermuchmorereasonablepassagefromthesame 
M. 
Bayle, 
where 
he 
disputes 
with 
greater 
force 
the 
so-called 
lively 
sense 
of 
freedom, 
which 
according 
to 
the 
Cartesians 
is 
a 
proof 
of 
freedom. 
His 
words 
are 
indeed 
full 
of 
wit, 
and 
worthy 
of 
consideration, 
and 
occur 
in 
the 
Reply 
to 
the 
Questions 
of 
a 
Provincial 
(vol. 
III, 
ch. 
140, 
seqq.). 
Here 
they 
are: 
‘By 
the 
clear 
and 
distinct 
sense 
we 
have 
of 
our 
existence 
we 
do 
not 
discern 
whether 
we 
exist 
through 
ourselves 
or 
derive 
our 
being 
from 
another. 
We 
discern 
that 
only 
by 
reflexion, 
that 
is, 
through 
meditation 
upon 
our 
powerlessness 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
conserving 
ourselves 
as 
much 
as 
we 
would, 
and 
of 
freeing 
ourselves 
from 
dependence 
upon 
the 
beings 
that 
surround 
us, 
etc. 
It 
is 
indeed 
certain 
that 
the 
pagans 
(the 
same 
must 
be 
said 
of 
the 
Socinians, 
since 
they 
deny 
the 
creation) 
never 
attained 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
that 
true 
dogma 
that 
we 
were 
created 
from 
nothing, 
and 
that 
we 
are 
derived 
from 
nothingness 
at 
everymoment 
ofour 
continuance. 
Theythereforethoughterroneouslythatall

in

Does 
not 
this 
error 
spring 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
unconscious 
of 
the 
creative 
action 
which 
conserves 
us, 
and 
that 
we 
are 
only 
conscious 
of 
our 
existence? 
That 
we 
are 
conscious 
of 
it, 
I 
say, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
we 
should 
for 
ever 
remain 
ignorant 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
being 
if 
other 
knowledge 
did 
not 
aid 
us? 
Let 
us 
say 
also, 
that 
the 
clear 
and 
distinct 
sense 
we 
have 
of 
the 
acts 
of 
our 
will 
cannot 
make 
us 
discern 
whether 
we 
give 
them 
ourselves 
to 
ourselves 
or 
receive 
them 
from 
that 
same 
cause 
which 
gives 
us 
existence. 
We 
must 
have 
recourse 
to 
reflexion 
or 
to 
meditation 
in 
order 
to 
effect 
this 
discrimination. 
Now 
I 
assert 
that 
one 
can 
never 
by 
purely 
philosophical 
meditations 
arrive 
at 
an 
established 
certainty 
that 
we 
are 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
our 
volitions: 
for 
every 
person 
who 
makes 
due 
investigation 
will 
recognize 
clearly, 
that 
if 
we 
were 
only 
passive 
subjects 
with 
regard 
to 
will 
we 
should 
have 
the 
same 
sensations 
of 
experience 
as 
we 
have 
when 
we 
think 
that 
we 
are 
free. 
Assume, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
that 
God 
so 
ordered 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
union 
between 
soul 
and 
body 
that 
all 
the 
modalities 
of 
the 
soul, 
without 
a 
single 
exception, 
are 
of 
necessity 
linked 
together 
with 
the 
interposition 
of 
the 
modalities 
of 
the 
brain. 
You 
will 
then 
understand 
that 
nothing 
will 
happen 
to 
us 
except 
that 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious: 
there 
will 
be 
in 
our 
soul 
the 
same 
sequence 
of 
thoughts 
from 
the 
perception 
of 
objects 
of 
the 
senses, 
which 
is 
its 
first 
step, 
up 
to 
the 
most 
definite 
volitions, 
which 
are 
its 
final 
step. 
There 
will 
be 
in 
this 
sequence 
the 
consciousness 
of 
ideas, 
that 
of 
affirmations, 
that 
of 
irresolutions, 
that 
of 
velleities 
and 
that 
of 
volitions. 
For 
whether 
the 
act 
of 
willing 
be 
impressed 
upon 
us 
by 
an 
external 
cause 
or 
we 
bring 
it 
about 
ourselves, 
it 
will 
be 
equally 
true 
that 
we 
will, 
and 
that 
we 
feel 
that 
we 
will. 
Moreover, 
as 
this 
external 
cause 
can 
blend 
as 
much 
pleasure 
as 
it 
will 
with 
the 
volition 
which 
it 
impresses 
upon 
us, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
feel 
at 
times 
that 



the 
acts 
of 
our 
will 
please 
us 
infinitely, 
and 
that 
they 
lead 
us 
according 
to 
the 
bent 
of 
our 
strongest 
inclinations. 
We 
shall 
feel 
no 
constraint; 
you 
know 
the 
maxim: 
voluntas 
non 
potest 
cogi. 
Do 
you 
not 
clearly 
understand 
that 
a 
weather-vane, 
always 
having 
communicated 
to 
it 
simultaneously 
(in 
such 
a 
way, 
however, 
that 
priority 
of 
nature 
or, 
if 
one 
will, 
a 
real 
momentary 
priority, 
should 
attach 
to 
the 
desire 
for 
motion) 
movement 
towards 
a 
certain 
point 
on 
the 
horizon, 
and 
the 
wish 
to 
turn 
in 
that 
direction, 
would 
be 
persuaded 
that 
it 
moved 
of 
itself 
to 
fulfil 
the 
desires 
which 
it 
conceived? 
I 
assume 
that 
it 
would 
not 
know 
that 
there 
were 
winds, 
or 
that 
an 
external 
cause 
changed 
everything 
simultaneously, 
both 
its 
situation 
and 
its 
desires. 
That 
is 
the 
state 
we 
are 
in 
by 
our 
nature: 
we 
know 
not 
whether 
an 
invisible 
cause 
makes 
us 
pass 
sufficiently 
from 
one 
thought 
to 
another. 
It 
is 
therefore 
natural 
that 
men 
are 
persuaded 
that 
they 
determine 
their 
own 
acts. 
But 
it 
remains 
to 
be 
discovered 
whether 
they 
are 
mistaken 
in 
that, 
as 
in 
countless 
other 
things 
they 
affirm 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
instinct 
and 
without 
having 
made 
use 
of 
philosophic 
meditation. 
Since 
therefore 
there 
are 
two 
hypotheses 
as 
to 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
man: 
the 
one 
that 
he 
is 
only 
a 
passive 
subject, 
the 
other 
that 
he 
has 
active 
virtues, 
one 
cannot 
in 
reason 
prefer 
the 
second 
to 
the 
first, 
so 
long 
as 
one 
can 
only 
adduce 
proofs 
of 
feeling. 
For 
we 
should 
feel 
with 
an 
equal 
force 
that 
we 
wish 
this 
or 
that, 
whether 
all 
our 
volitions 
were 
imprinted 
upon 
oursoulby 
anexterior 
andinvisiblecause,orweformedthemourselves.’ 


300. 
There 
are 
here 
excellent 
arguments, 
which 
are 
valid 
against 
the 
usual 
systems; 
but 
they 
fail 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
System 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
which 
takes 
usfurtherthan 
we 
were 
abletogo 
formerly. 
M. 
Bayleasserts,for 
instance, 
‘that 
by 
purely 
philosophical 
meditations 
one 
can 
never 
attain 
to 
an 
established 
certainty 
that 
we 
are 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
our 
volitions’. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
point 
which 
I 
do 
not 
concede 
to 
him: 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
this 
system 
demonstrates 
beyond 
a 
doubt 
that 
in 
the 
course 
of 
nature 
each 
substance 
is 

the 
sole 
cause 
of 
all 
its 
actions, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
free 
of 
all 
physical 
influence 
from 
every 
other 
substance, 
save 
the 
customary 
co-operation 
of 
God. 
And 
this 
system 
shows 
that 
our 
spontaneity 
is 
real, 
and 
not 
only 
apparent, 
as 
Herr 
Wittich 
believed 
it 
to 
be. 
M. 
Bayle 
asserts 
also 
on 
the 
same 
reasons 
(ch. 
170, 
) 
that 
if 
there 
were 
a 
fatum 
Astrologicum 
this 
would 
not 
destroy 
freedom; 
and 
I 
would 
concede 
that 
to 
him, 
if 
freedom 
consisted 
only 
in 
an 
apparent 
spontaneity. 


301. 
The 
spontaneity 
of 
our 
actions 
can 
therefore 
no 
longer 
be 
questioned; 
and 
Aristotle 
has 
defined 
it 
well, 
saying 
that 
an 
action 
is 
spontaneous 
when 
its 
source 
is 
in 
him 
who 
acts. 
‘Spontaneum 
est, 
cujus 
principium 
est 
in 
agente.’ 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
our 
actions 
and 
our 
wills 
depend 
entirely 
upon 
us. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
are 
not 
directly 
the 
masters 
of 
our 
will, 
although 
we 
be 
its 
cause; 
for 
we 
do 
not 
choose 
volitions, 
as 
we 
choose 
our 
actions 
by 
our 
volitions. 
Yet 
we 
have 
a 
certain 
power 
also 
over 
our 
will, 
because 
we 
can 
contribute 
indirectlytowards 
willing 
another 
time 
that 
which 
wewould 
fain 
will 
now, 
as 
I 
have 
here 
already 
shown: 
that, 
however, 
is 
no 
velleity, 
properly 
speaking. 
There 
also 
we 
have 
a 
mastery, 
individual 
and 
even 
perceptible, 
over 
our 
actions 
and 
our 
wills, 
resulting 
from 
a 
combination 
of 
spontaneity 
with 
intelligence. 
302. 
Up 
to 
this 
point 
I 
have 
expounded 
the 
two 
conditions 
of 
freedom 
mentioned 
by 
Aristotle, 
that 
is, 
spontaneity 
and 
intelligence, 
which 
are 
found 
united 
in 
us 
in 
deliberation, 
whereas 
beasts 
lack 
the 
second 
condition. 
But 
the 
Schoolmen 
demand 
yet 
a 
third, 
which 
they 
call 
indifference. 
And 
indeed 
one 
must 
admit 
it, 
if 
indifference 
signifies 
as 
much 
as 
‘contingency’; 
for 
I 
have 
already 
said 
here 
that 
freedom 
must 
exclude 
an 
absolute 
and 
metaphysical 
or 
logical 
necessity. 
But, 
as 
I 
have 
declared 
more 
than 
once, 
this 
indifference, 
this 
contingency, 
this 
non-necessity, 
if 
I 
may 
venture 
so 
to 
speak, 
which 
is 
a 
characteristic 
attribute 
of 
freedom, 
does 
not 
prevent 
one 
from 
having 
stronger 

inclinations 
towards 
the 
course 
one 
chooses; 
nor 
does 
it 
by 
any 
means 
require 
that 
one 
be 
absolutely 
and 
equally 
indifferent 
towards 
the 
two 
opposing 
courses. 


303. 
I 
therefore 
admit 
indifference 
only 
in 
the 
one 
sense, 
implying 
the 
same 
as 
contingency, 
or 
non-necessity. 
But, 
as 
I 
have 
declared 
more 
than 
once, 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
an 
indifference 
of 
equipoise, 
and 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
one 
ever 
chooses 
when 
one 
is 
absolutely 
indifferent. 
Such 
a 
choice 
would 
be, 
as 
it 
were, 
mere 
chance, 
without 
determining 
reason, 
whether 
apparent 
or 
hidden. 
But 
such 
a 
chance, 
such 
an 
absolute 
and 
actual 
fortuity, 
is 
a 
chimera 
which 
never 
occurs 
in 
nature. 
All 
wise 
men 
are 
agreed 
that 
chance 
is 
only 
an 
apparent 
thing, 
like 
fortune: 
only 
ignorance 
of 
causes 
gives 
rise 
to 
it. 
But 
if 
there 
were 
such 
a 
vague 
indifference, 
or 
rather 
if 
we 
were 
to 
choose 
without 
having 
anything 
to 
prompt 
us 
to 
the 
choice, 
chance 
would 
then 
be 
something 
actual, 
resembling 
what, 
according 
to 
Epicurus, 
took 
place 
in 
that 
little 
deviation 
of 
the 
atoms, 
occurring 
without 
cause 
or 
reason. 
Epicurus 
had 
introduced 
it 
in 
order 
to 
evade 
necessity, 
and 
Cicero 
with 
good 
reason 
ridiculedit. 
304. 
This 
deviation 
had 
a 
final 
cause 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
Epicurus, 
his 
aim 
being 
to 
free 
us 
from 
fate; 
but 
it 
can 
have 
no 
efficient 
cause 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
impossible 
of 
chimeras. 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
refutes 
it 
admirably, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
presently. 
And 
yet 
it 
is 
surprising 
that 
he 
appears 
to 
admit 
elsewhere 
himself 
something 
of 
like 
nature 
with 
this 
supposed 
deviation: 
here 
is 
what 
he 
says, 
when 
speaking 
of 
Buridan’s 
ass 
(Dictionary, 
art. 
‘Buridan’, 
lit. 
13): 
‘Those 
who 
advocate 
free 
will 
properly 
so 
called 
admit 
in 
man 
a 
power 
of 
determining, 
either 
to 
the 
right 
hand 
or 
the 
left, 
even 
when 
the 
motives 
are 
perfectly 
uniform 
on 
the 
side 
of 
each 
of 
the 
two 
opposing 
objects. 
For 
they 
maintain 
that 
our 
soul 
can 
say, 
without 
having 
any 

reason 
other 
than 
that 
of 
using 
its 
freedom: 
“I 
prefer 
this 
to 
that, 
although 
I 
seenothingmoreworthyofmychoiceintheonethantheother”.’ 


305. 
All 
those 
who 
admit 
a 
free 
will 
properly 
so 
called 
will 
not 
for 
that 
reason 
concede 
to 
M. 
Bayle 
this 
determination 
springing 
from 
an 
indeterminate 
cause. 
St. 
Augustine 
and 
the 
Thomists 
believe 
that 
all 
is 
determined. 
And 
one 
sees 
that 
their 
opponents 
resort 
also 
to 
the 
circumstances 
which 
contribute 
to 
our 
choice. 
Experience 
by 
no 
means 
approves 
the 
chimera 
of 
an 
indifference 
of 
equipoise; 
and 
one 
can 
employ 
here 
the 
argument 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
employed 
against 
the 
Cartesians’ 
manner 
of 
proving 
freedom 
by 
the 
lively 
sense 
of 
our 
independence. 
For 
although 
I 
do 
not 
always 
see 
the 
reason 
for 
an 
inclination 
which 
makes 
me 
choose 
between 
two 
apparently 
uniform 
courses, 
there 
will 
always 
be 
some 
impression, 
however 
imperceptible, 
that 
determines 
us. 
The 
mere 
desire 
to 
make 
use 
of 
one’s 
freedom 
has 
no 
effect 
of 
specifying, 
or 
determining 
us 
to 
thechoiceof 
onecourse 
ortheother. 
306. 
M. 
Baylegoes 
on: 
‘There 
are 
attheveryleasttwowayswhereby 
man 
can 
extricate 
himself 
from 
the 
snares 
of 
equipoise. 
One, 
which 
I 
have 
already 
mentioned, 
is 
for 
a 
man 
to 
flatter 
himself 
with 
the 
pleasing 
fancy 
that 
he 
is 
masterin 
his 
ownhouse,andthat 
hedoesnotdependupon 
objects.’ 
Thisway 
is 
blocked: 
for 
all 
that 
one 
might 
wish 
to 
play 
master 
in 
one’s 
own 
house, 
that 
has 
no 
determining 
effect, 
nor 
does 
it 
favour 
one 
course 
more 
than 
the 
other. 
M. 
Bayle 
goes 
on: 
‘He 
would 
make 
this 
Act: 
I 
will 
prefer 
this 
to 
that, 
because 
it 
pleases 
me 
to 
behave 
thus.’ 
But 
these 
words, 
‘because 
it 
pleases 
me’, 
‘because 
such 
is 
my 
pleasure’, 
imply 
already 
a 
leaning 
towards 
‘the 
object 
thatpleases’. 
307. 
There 
is 
therefore 
no 
justification 
for 
continuing 
thus: 
‘And 
so 
that 
which 
determined 
him 
would 
not 
be 
taken 
from 
the 
object; 
the 
motive 
would 
be 
derived 
only 
from 
the 
ideas 
men 
have 
of 
their 
own 
perfections, 
or 
of 
their 

natural 
faculties. 
The 
other 
way 
is 
that 
of 
the 
lot 
or 
chance: 
the 
short 
straw 
would 
decide.’ 
This 
way 
has 
an 
outlet, 
but 
it 
does 
notreach 
the 
goal: 
it 
would 
alter 
the 
issue, 
for 
in 
such 
a 
case 
it 
is 
not 
man 
who 
decides. 
Or 
again 
if 
one 
maintains 
that 
it 
is 
still 
the 
man 
who 
decides 
by 
lot, 
man 
himself 
is 
no 
longer 
in 
equipoise, 
because 
the 
lot 
is 
not, 
and 
the 
man 
has 
attached 
himself 
to 
it. 
There 
are 
always 
reasons 
in 
Nature 
which 
cause 
that 
which 
happens 
by 
chance 
or 
through 
the 
lot. 
I 
am 
somewhat 
surprised 
that 
a 
mind 
so 
shrewd 
as 


M. 
Bayle’s 
could 
have 
allowed 
itself 
to 
be 
so 
misled 
on 
this 
point. 
I 
have 
set 
out 
elsewhere 
the 
true 
rejoinder 
to 
the 
Buridan 
sophism: 
it 
is 
that 
the 
case 
of 
perfect 
equipoise 
is 
impossible, 
since 
the 
universe 
can 
never 
be 
halved, 
so 
as 
tomakeallimpressions 
equivalentonbothsides. 
308. 
Let 
us 
see 
what 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
says 
elsewhere 
against 
the 
chimerical 
or 
absolutely 
undefined 
indifference. 
Cicero 
had 
said 
(in 
his 
book 
De 
Fato) 
that 
Carneades 
had 
found 
something 
more 
subtle 
than 
the 
deviation 
of 
atoms, 
attributing 
the 
cause 
of 
a 
so-called 
absolutely 
undefined 
indifference 
to 
the 
voluntary 
motions 
of 
souls, 
because 
these 
motions 
have 
no 
need 
of 
an 
external 
cause, 
coming 
as 
they 
do 
from 
our 
nature. 
But 
M.

‘that 
a 
freedom 
far 
removed 
from 
this 
so-called 
equipoise 
is 
incomparably 
more 
beneficial. 
I 
mean’, 
he 
says, 
‘a 
freedom 
such 
as 
may 
always 
follow 
the 
judgements 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
such 
as 
cannot 
resist 
objects 
clearly 
recognized 
as 
good. 
I 
know 
of 
no 
people 
who 
do 
not 
agree 
that 
truth 
clearly 
recognized 
necessitates’ 
(determines 
rather, 
unless 
one 
speak 
of 
a 
moral 
necessity) 
‘the 
assent 
of 
the 
soul; 
experience 
teaches 
us 
that. 
In 
the 
schools 
they 
teach 
constantly 
that 
as 
the 
true 
is 
the 
object 
of 
the 

understanding, 
so 
the 
good 
is 
the 
object 
of 
the 
will. 
So 
likewise 
they 
teach 
that 
as 
the 
understanding 
can 
never 
affirm 
anything 
save 
that 
which 
is 
shown 
to 
it 
under 
thesemblanceof 
truth, 
thewillcanneverloveanythingwhichto 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
good. 
One 
never 
believes 
the 
false 
as 
such, 
and 
one 
never 
loves 
evil 
as 
evil. 
There 
is 
in 
the 
understanding 
a 
natural 
determination 
towards 
the 
true 
in 
general, 
and 
towards 
each 
individual 
truth 
clearly 
recognized. 
There 
is 
in 
the 
will 
a 
natural 
determination 
towards 
good 
in 
general; 
whence 
many 
philosophers 
conclude 
that 
from 
the 
moment 
when 
individual 
goods 
are 
clearly 
recognized 
by 
us 
we 
are 
of 
necessity 
compelled 
to 
love 
them. 
The 
understanding 
suspends 
its 
actions 
only 
when 
its 
objects 
show 
themselves 
obscurely, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
cause 
for 
doubt 
as 
to 
whether 
they 
are 
false 
or 
true. 
That 
leads 
many 
persons 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
will 
remains 
in 
equipoise 
only 
when 
the 
soul 
is 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
object 
presented 
to 
it 
is 
a 
good 
with 
regard 
to 
it; 
but 
that 
also, 
the 
moment 
the 
soul 
decides 
in 
the 
affirmative, 
it 
of 
necessity 
clings 
to 
that 
object 
until 
other 
judgements 
of 
the 
mind 
determine 
it 
otherwise. 
Those 
who 
expound 
freedom 
in 
this 
fashion 
think 
to 
find 
therein 
plentiful 
enough 
material 
for 
merit 
or 
demerit. 
For 
they 
assume 
that 
these 
judgements 
of 
the 
mind 
proceed 
from 
a 
free 
attention 
of 
the 
soul 
in 
examining 
the 
objects, 
comparing 
them 
together, 
and 
discriminating 
betweenthem. 
Imust 
notforgetthat 
there

men’ 
(such 
as 
Bellarmine, 
lib. 
3, 
De 
Gratia 
et 
Libero 
Arbitrio, 
c. 
8, 
et 
9, 
and 
Cameron, 
in 
Responsione 
ad 
Epistolam 
Viri 
Docti, 
id 
est 
Episcopii) 
‘who 
maintain 
with

cogent 
reasons 
that 
the 
will 
always 
of 
necessity 
follows 
thelast 
practicalact 
oftheunderstanding.’ 


310. 
One 
must 
make 
some 
observations 
on 
this 
discourse. 
A 
very 
clear 
recognition 
of 
the 
best 
determines 
the 
will; 
but 
it 
does 
not 
necessitate 
it, 
properly 
speaking. 
One 
must 
always 
distinguish 
between 
the 
necessary 
and 
the 
certain 
or 
infallible, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
observed 
more 
than 
once, 
and 

distinguish 
metaphysical 
necessity 
from 
moral 
necessity. 
I 
think 
also 
that 
it 
is 
only 
God’s 
will 
which 
always 
follows 
the 
judgements 
of 
the 
understanding: 
all 
intelligent 
creatures 
are 
subject 
to 
some 
passions, 
or 
to 
perceptions 
at 
least, 
that 
are 
not 
composed 
entirely 
of 
what 
I 
call 
adequate 
ideas. 
And 
although 
in 
the 
blessed 
these 
passions 
always 
tend 
towards 
the 
true 
good, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
Nature 
and 
the 
system 
of 
things 
pre-established 
in 
relation 
to 
them, 
yet 
this 
does 
not 
always 
happen 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
they 
have 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
that 
good. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
them 
as 
with 
us, 
who 
do 
not 
always 
understand 
the 
reason 
for 
our 
instincts. 
The 
angels 
and 
the 
blessed 
are 
created 
beings, 
even 
as 
we 
are, 
in 
whom 
there 
is 
always 
some 
confused 
perception 
mingled 
with 
distinct 
knowledge. 
Suarez 
said 
something 
similar 
concerning 
them. 
He 
thinks 
(Treatise 
on 
Prayer, 
book 
I, 
ch. 
11) 
that 
God 
has 
so 
ordered 
things 
beforehand 
that 
their 
prayers, 
when 
they 
are 
made 
with 
a 
full 
will, 
always 
succeed: 
that 
is 
an 
example 
of 
a 
pre-established 
harmony. 
As 
for 
us, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding, 
of 
which 
we 
have 
an 
express 
knowledge, 
there 
are 
mingled 
therewith 
confused 
perceptions 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
these 
beget 
passions 
and 
even 
imperceptible 
inclinations, 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
always 
aware. 
These 
movements 
often 
thwartthejudgementofthepracticalunderstanding. 


311. 
As 
for 
the 
parallel 
between 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
understanding 
to 
the 
true 
and 
that 
of 
the 
will 
to 
the 
good, 
one 
must 
know 
that 
a 
clear 
and 
distinct 
perception 
of 
a 
truth 
contains 
within 
it 
actually 
the 
affirmation 
of 
this 
truth: 
thus 
the 
understanding 
is 
necessitated 
in 
that 
direction. 
But 
whatever 
perception 
one 
may 
have 
of 
the 
good, 
the 
effort 
to 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
judgement, 
which 
in 
my 
opinion 
forms 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
will, 
is 
distinct 
from 
it. 
Thus, 
since 
there 
is 
need 
of 
time 
to 
raise 
this 
effort 
to 
its 
climax, 
it 
may 
be 
suspended, 
and 
even 
changed, 
by 
a 
new 
perception 
or 
inclination 
which 
passes 
athwart 
it, 
which 
diverts 
the 
mind 
from 
it, 
and 
which 
even 

causes 
it 
sometimes 
to 
make 
a 
contrary 
judgement. 
Hence 
it 
comes 
that 
our 
soul 
has 
so 
many 
means 
of 
resisting 
the 
truth 
which 
it 
knows, 
and 
that 
the 
passage 
from 
mind 
to 
heart 
is 
so 
long. 
Especially 
is 
this 
so 
when 
the 
understanding 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
proceeds 
only 
by 
faint 
thoughts, 
which 
have 
only 
slight 
power 
to 
affect, 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
elsewhere. 
Thus 
the 
connexion 
between 
judgement 
and 
will 
is 
not 
so 
necessary 
as 
one 
might 
think. 


312. 
M. 
Bayle 
goes 
on 
to 
say, 
with 
truth 
(): 
‘Indeed, 
it 
cannot 
be 
a 
fault 
in 
man’s 
soul 
that 
it 
has 
no 
freedom 
of 
indifference 
as 
regards 
good 
in 
general. 
It 
would 
be 
rather 
a 
disorder, 
an 
inordinate 
imperfection, 
if 
one 
could 
say 
truthfully: 
It 
is 
all 
one 
to 
me 
whether 
I 
am 
happy 
or 
unhappy; 
I 
have 
no 
more 
determination 
to 
love 
the 
good 
than 
to 
hate 
it;I 
can 
do 
both 
equally. 
Now 
if 
it 
is 
a 
praiseworthy 
and 
advantageous 
quality 
to 
be 
determinate 
as 
regards 
good 
in 
general, 
it 
cannot 
be 
a 
fault 
if 
one 
is 
necessitated 
as 
regards 
each 
individualgoodrecognized 
plainlyasforourgood. 
Itseems 
even 
asthough 
it 
were 
a 
necessary 
conclusion, 
that 
if 
the 
soul 
has 
no 
freedom 
of 
indifference 
as 
regards 
good 
in 
general, 
it 
also 
has 
none 
in 
respect 
of 
particular 
goods 
which 
after 
due 
examination 
it 
judges 
to 
be 
goods 
in 
relation 
to 
it. 
What 
should 
we 
think 
of 
a 
soul 
which, 
having 
formed 
that 
judgement, 
had, 
and 
prided 
itself 
on 
having, 
the 
power 
not 
to 
love 
these 
goods, 
and 
even 
to 
hate 
them, 
and 
which 
said: 
I 
recognize 
clearly 
that 
these 
are 
goods 
for 
me, 
I 
have 
all 
the 
enlightenment 
necessary 
on 
that 
point; 
nevertheless 
I 
will 
not 
love 
them, 
I 
will 
hate 
them; 
my 
decision 
is 
made, 
I 
act 
upon 
it; 
it 
is 
not 
that 
any 
reason’ 
(thatis,any 
other 
reasonthanthatwhich 
isfoundedupon 
‘Suchis 
my 
good 
pleasure’) 
‘urges 
me 
thereto, 
but 
it 
pleases 
me 
so 
to 
behave: 
what 
should 
we 
think, 
I 
say, 
of 
such 
a 
soul? 
Should 
we 
not 
find 
it 
more 
imperfect 
and 
more 
unhappythanifithad 
not 
thisfreedomofindifference? 

313. 
‘Not 
only 
does 
the 
doctrine 
that 
subjects 
the 
will 
to 
the 
final 
acts 
of 
the 
understanding 
give 
a 
more 
favourable 
idea 
of 
the 
state 
of 
the 
soul, 
but 
it 
shows 
also 
that 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
lead 
man 
to 
happiness 
along 
that 
road 
than 
along 
the 
road 
of 
indifference. 
It 
will 
suffice 
to 
enlighten 
his 
mind 
upon 
his 
true 
interests, 
and 
straightway 
his 
will 
will 
comply 
with 
the 
judgements 
that 
reason 
shall 
have 
pronounced. 
But 
if 
he 
has 
a 
freedom 
independent 
of 
reason 
and 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
objects 
clearly 
recognized, 
he 
will 
be 
the 
most 
intractable 
of 
all 
animals, 
and 
it 
will 
never 
be 
possible 
to 
rely 
upon 
making 
him 
choose 
the 
right 
course. 
All 
the 
counsels, 
all 
the 
arguments 
in 
the 
world 
may 
prove 
unavailing; 
you 
will 
give 
him 
explanations, 
you 
will 
convince 
his 
mind, 
and 
yet 
his 
will 
will 
play 
the 
haughty 
madam 
and 
remain 
motionless 
as 
a 
rock. 
Vergil, 
Aen. 
lib. 
6,v. 
470: 
Non 
magis 
incepto 
vultum 
sermone 
movetur, 
Quam 
si 
dura 
silex, 
aut 
stet 
Marpesia

A 
caprice, 
an 
empty 
whim 
will 
make 
her 
stiffen 
against 
reasons 
of 
all 


kinds; 
it 
will 
not 
please 
her 
to 
love 
her 
clearly 
recognized 
good, 
it 
will 
please 
her 
to 
hate 
it. 
Do 
you 
consider 
such 
a 
faculty, 
sir, 
to 
be 
the 
richest 
present 
God 
can 
have 
made 
to 
man, 
and 
the 
sole 
instrument 
of 
our 
happiness? 
Is 
it 
not 
rather 
an 
obstacle 
to 
our 
felicity? 
Is 
there 
cause 
for 
boasting 
in 
being 
able 
to 
say: 
“I 
have 
scorned 
all 
the 
judgements 
of 
my 
reason, 
and 
I 
have 
followed 
an 
altogether 
different 
path, 
simply 
from 
considerations 
of 
my 
own 
good 
pleasure?” 
With 
what 
regrets 
would 
one 
not 
be 
torn, 
in 
that 
case, 
if 
the 
determination 
made 
had 
an 
ill 
result? 
Such 
a 
freedom 
would 
therefore 
be 
more 
harmful 
than 
profitable 
to 
men, 
because 
the 
understanding 
would 
not 
present 
all 
the 
goodness 
of 
the 
objects 
clearly 
enough 
to 
deprive 
the 
will 
of 
the 
power 
of 
rejection. 
It 
would 
be 
therefore 
infinitely 
better 
for 
man 
to 
be 
always 
of 
necessity 
determined 
by 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding, 
than 



to 
permit 
the 
will 
to 
suspend 
its 
action. 
For 
by 
this 
means 
it 
would 
achieve 
its 
aim 
withgreatereaseandcertainty.’ 


314. 
Upon 
this 
discourse 
I 
make 
the 
further 
observation, 
that 
it 
is 
very 
true 
that 
a 
freedom 
of 
indifference, 
undefined 
and 
without 
any 
determining 
reason, 
would 
be 
as 
harmful, 
and 
even 
objectionable, 
as 
it 
is 
impracticable 
and 
chimerical. 
The 
man 
who 
wished 
to 
behave 
thus, 
or 
at 
the 
least 
appear 
to 
be 
acting 
without 
due 
cause, 
would 
most 
certainly 
be 
looked 
upon 
as 
irrational. 
But 
it 
is 
very 
true 
also 
that 
the 
thing 
is 
impossible, 
when 
it 
is 
taken 
strictly 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
assumption. 
As 
soon 
as 
one 
tries 
to 
give 
an 
example 
of 
it 
one 
misses 
one’s 
aim 
and 
stumbles 
upon 
the 
case 
of 
a 
man 
who, 
while 
he 
does 
not 
come 
to 
a 
decision 
without 
cause, 
does 
so 
rather 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
inclination 
or 
passion 
than 
of 
judgement. 
As 
soon 
as 
one 
says: 
‘I 
scorn 
the 
judgements 
of 
my 
reason 
simply 
from 
considerations 
of 
my 
own 
good 
pleasure, 
it 
pleases 
me 
to 
behave 
thus’, 
it 
is 
as 
if 
one 
were 
to 
say: 
Iprefermyinclinationto 
my 
interest,my 
pleasureto 
my 
profit. 
315. 
Even 
so 
some 
capricious 
man, 
fancying 
that 
it 
is 
ignominious 
for 
him 
to 
follow 
the 
advice 
of 
his 
friends 
or 
his 
servants, 
might 
prefer 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
contradicting 
them 
to 
the 
profit 
he 
could 
derive 
from 
their 
counsel. 
It 
may 
happen, 
however, 
that 
in 
a 
matter 
of 
small 
moment 
a 
wise 
man 
acts 
irregularly 
and 
against 
his 
own 
interest 
in 
order 
to 
thwart 
another 
who 
tries 
to 
restrain 
him 
or 
direct 
him, 
or 
that 
he 
may 
disconcert 
those 
who 
watch 
his 
steps. 
It 
is 
even 
well 
at 
times 
to 
imitate 
Brutus 
by 
concealing 
one’s 
wit, 
and 
even 
to 
feign 
madness, 
as 
David 
did 
before 
the 
King 
of 
the 
Philistines. 
316. 
M. 
Bayle 
admirably 
supplements 
his 
remarks 
with 
the 
object 
of 
showing 
that 
to 
act 
against 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding 
would 
be 
a 
great 
imperfection. 
He 
observes 
() 
that, 
even 
according 
to 
the 
Molinists, 
‘the 
understanding 
which 
does 
its 
duty 
well 
indicates 
that 
which 
is 
the 
best’. 
He 

introduces 
God 
(ch. 
91, 
) 
saying 
to 
our 
first 
parents 
in 
the 
Garden 
of 
Eden: 
‘I 
have 
given 
you 
my 
knowledge, 
the 
faculty 
of 
judging 
things, 
and 
full 
power 
to 
dispose 
your 
wills. 
I 
shall 
give 
you 
instructions 
and 
orders; 
but 
the 
free 
will 
that 
I 
have 
bestowed 
upon 
you 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
you 
have 
equal 
power 
(according 
to 
circumstances) 
to 
obey 
me 
and 
to 
disobey 
me. 
You 
will 
be 
tempted: 
if 
you 
make 
a 
good 
use 
of 
your 
freedom 
you 
will 
be 
happy; 
and 
if 
you 
use 
it 
ill 
you 
will 
be 
unhappy. 
It 
is 
for 
you 
to 
see 
if 
you 
wish 
to 
ask 
of 
me, 
as 
a 
new 
grace, 
either 
that 
I 
permit 
you 
to 
abuse 
your 
freedom 
when 
you 
shall 
make 
resolve 
to 
do 
so, 
or 
that 
I 
prevent 
you 
from 
doing 
so. 
Consider 
carefully, 
I 
give 
you 
four 
and 
twenty 
hours. 
Do 
you 
not 
clearly 
understand’ 
(adds 
M. 
Bayle) 
‘that 
their 
reason, 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
been 
obscured 
by 
sin, 
would 
have 
made 
them 
conclude 
that 
they 
must 
ask 
God, 
as 
the 
crowning 
point 
of 
the 
favours 
wherewith 
he 
had 
honoured 
them, 
not 
to 
permit 
them 
to 
destroy 
themselvesby 
an 
illuse 
of 
theirpowers?Andmust 
one 
notadmit 
that 
if 
Adam, 
through 
wrongly 
making 
it 
a 
point 
of 
honour 
to 
order 
his 
own 
goings, 
had 
refused 
a 
divine 
direction 
that 
would 
have 
safeguarded 
his 
happiness, 
he 
would 
have 
been 
the 
prototype 
of 
all 
such 
as 
Phaeton 
and 
Icarus? 
He 
would 
have 
been 
well-nigh 
as 
ungodly 
as 
the 
Ajax 
of 
Sophocles, 
who 
wished 
to 
conquer 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
gods, 
and 
who 
said 
that 
the 
mostcravenwouldputtheirenemiestoflightwithsuchaid.’ 


317. 
M. 
Bayle 
also 
shows 
(ch. 
80) 
that 
one 
congratulates 
oneself 
no 
less, 
or 
even 
takes 
more 
credit 
to 
oneself, 
for 
having 
been 
aided 
from 
above, 
than 
for 
owing 
one’s 
happiness 
to 
one’s 
own 
choice. 
And 
if 
one 
does 
well 
through 
having 
preferred 
a 
tumultuous 
instinct, 
which 
arose 
suddenly, 
to 
reasons 
maturely 
considered, 
one 
feels 
an 
extraordinary 
joy 
in 
this; 
for 
one 
assumes 
that 
either 
God, 
or 
our 
Guardian 
Angel, 
or 
something 
or 
other 
which 
one 
pictures 
to 
oneself 
under 
the 
vague 
name 
of 
good 
luck 
has 
impelled 
us 
thereto. 
Indeed, 
Sulla 
and 
Caesar 
boasted 
more 
of 
their 
good 
luck 
than 
of 

their 
prudence. 
The 
pagans, 
and 
particularly 
the 
poets 
(Homer 
especially), 
determined 
their 
heroes’ 
acts 
by 
divine 
promptings. 
The 
hero 
of 
the 
Aeneid 
proceeds 
only 
under 
thedirection 
of 
a 
God. 
It 
was 
very 
greatpraiseoffered 
to 
the 
Emperors 
if 
one 
said 
that 
they 
were 
victorious 
both 
through 
their 
troops 
and 
through 
their 
gods 
whom 
they 
lent 
to 
their 
generals: 
‘Te 
copias, 
te 
consilium 
et 
tuos 
praebente 
Divos,’ 
said 
Horace. 
The 
generals 
fought 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Emperors, 
as 
if 
trusting 
to 
the 
Emperor’s 
good 
luck, 
for 
subordinate 
officers 
had 
no 
rights 
regarding 
the 
auspices. 
One 
takes 
credit 
to 
oneself 
for 
being 
a 
favourite 
of 
heaven, 
one 
rates 
oneself 
more 
highly 
for 
the 
possession 
of 
good 
fortune 
than 
of 
talent. 
There 
are 
no 
people 
that 
think 
themselves 
more 
fortunate 
than 
the 
mystics, 
who 
imagine 
that 
they 
keep 
still 
whileGodactswithinthem. 


318. 
‘On 
the 
other 
hand’, 
M. 
Bayle 
adds 
(ch. 
83), 
‘a 
Stoic 
philosopher, 
who 
attaches 
to 
everything 
an 
inevitable 
necessity, 
is 
as 
susceptible 
as 
another 
man 
to 
the 
pleasure 
of 
having 
chosen 
well. 
And 
every 
man 
of 
sense 
will 
find 
that, 
far 
from 
taking 
pleasure 
in 
the 
thought 
of 
having 
deliberated 
long 
and 
finally 
chosen 
the 
most 
honourable 
course, 
one 
feels 
incredible 
satisfaction 
in 
persuading 
oneself 
that 
one 
is 
so 
firmly 
rooted 
in 
the 
love 
of 
virtue 
that 
without 
the 
slightest 
resistance 
one 
would 
repel 
a 
temptation. 
A 
man 
to 
whom 
is 
suggested 
the 
doing 
of 
a 
deed 
contrary 
to 
his 
duty, 
his 
honour 
and 
his 
conscience, 
who 
answers 
forthwith 
that 
he 
is 
incapable 
of 
such 
a 
crime, 
and 
who 
is 
certainly 
not 
capable 
of 
it, 
is 
far 
more 
contented 
with 
himself 
than 
if 
he 
asked 
for 
time 
to 
consider 
it, 
and 
were 
for 
some 
hours 
in 
a 
state 
of 
indecision 
as 
to 
which 
course 
to 
take. 
One 
is 
on 
many 
occasions 
regretful 
over 
not 
being 
able 
to 
make 
up 
one’s 
mind 
between 
two 
courses, 
and 
one 
would 
be 
well 
pleased 
that 
the 
counsel 
of 
a 
good 
friend, 
or 
some 
succour 
from 
above, 
should 
impel 
us 
to 
make 
a 
good 
choice.’ 
All 
that 
demonstrates 
for 
us 
the 
advantage 
a 
determinate 
judgement 
has 
over 
that 

vague 
indifference 
which 
leaves 
us 
in 
u 
sufficiently 
that 
only 
ignorance 
or 
passio 
have 
thus 
given 
the 
reason 
why 
God 
is 
n 
to 
him, 
the 
more 
perfect 
is 
freedom, 
a 
good

I 
have 
been 
well

to 
pres 
M. 
Bayle 
against

something 
chimerical. 
It

can 
regulate

It 
is

She 
touched 
the 
face 
of 
Theodorus 
with 
an 
olive-branch, 
which 
she 
was 
holding 
in 
her 
hand. 
And 
lo! 
he 
had 
become 
able 
to 
confront 
the 
divine 
radiancy 
of 
the 
daughter 
of 
Jupiter, 
and 
of 
all 
that 
she 
should 
show 
him. 
Jupiter 
who 
loves 
you 
(she 
said 
to 
him) 
has 
commended 
you 
to 
me 
to 
be 
instructed. 
You 
see 
here 
the 
palace 
ofthe 
fates, 
whereI 
keepwatchand 
ward. 
Here 
are 
representations 
not 
only 
of 
that 
which 
happens 
but 
also 
of 
all 
that 
which 
is 
possible. 
Jupiter, 
having 
surveyed 
them 
before 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
existing 
world, 
classified 
the 
possibilities 
into 
worlds, 
and 
chose 
the 
best 
of 
all. 
He 
comes 
sometimes 
to 
visit 
these 
places, 
to 
enjoy 
the 
pleasure 
of 
recapitulating 
things 
and 
of 
renewing 
his 
own 
choice, 
which 
cannot 
fail 
to 
please 
him. 
I 
have 
only 
to 
speak, 
and 
we 
shall 
see 
a 
whole 
world 
that 
my 
father 
might 
have 
produced, 
wherein 
will 
be 
represented 
anything 
that 
can 
be 
asked 
of 
him; 
and 
in 
this 
way 
one 
may 
know 
also 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
any 
particular 
possibility 
should 
attain 
unto 
existence. 
And 
whenever 
the 
conditions 
are 
not 
determinate 
enough, 
there 
will 
be 
as 
many 
such 
worlds 
differing 
from 
one 
another 
as 
one 
shall 
wish, 
which 
will 
answer 
differently 
the 
same 
question, 
in 
as 
many 
ways 
as 
possible. 
You 
learnt 
geometry 
in 
your 
youth, 
like 
all 
well-instructed 
Greeks. 
You 
know 
therefore 
that 
when 
the 
conditions 
of 
a 
required 
point 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
determine 
it, 
and 
there 
is 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
them, 
they 
all 
fall 
into 
what 
the 
geometricians 
call 
a 
locus, 
and 
this 
locus 
at 
least 
(which 
is 
often 
a 
line) 
will 
be 
determinate. 
Thus 
you 
can 
picture 
to 
yourself 
an 
ordered 
succession 
of 
worlds, 
which 
shall 
contain 
each 
and 
every 
one 
the 
case 
that 
is 
in 
question, 
and 
shall 
vary 
its 
circumstances 
and 
its 
consequences. 
But 
if 
you 
put 
a 
case 
that 
differs 
from 
the 
actual 
world 
only 
in 
one 
single 
definite 
thing 
and 
in 
its 
results, 
a 
certain 
one 
of 
those 
determinate 
worlds 
will 
answer 
you. 
These 
worlds 
are 
all 
here, 
that 
is, 
in 
ideas. 
I 
will 
show 
you 
some, 
wherein 
shall 
be 
found, 
not 
absolutely 
the 
same 
Sextus 
as 
you 
have 
seen 
(that 
is 
not 
possible, 
he 
carries 
with 
him 



always 
that 
which 
he 
shall 
be) 
but 
several 
Sextuses 
resembling 
him, 
possessing 
all 
that 
you 
know 
already 
of 
the 
true 
Sextus, 
but 
not 
all 
that 
is 
already 
in 
him 
imperceptibly, 
nor 
in 
consequence 
all 
that 
shall 
yet 
happen 
to 
him. 
You 
will 
find 
in 
one 
world 
a 
very 
happy 
and 
noble 
Sextus, 
in 
another 
a 
Sextus 
content 
with 
a 
mediocre 
state, 
a 
Sextus, 
indeed, 
of 
every 
kind 
and 
endlessdiversity 
offorms. 


415. 
Thereupon 
the 
Goddess 
led 
Theodorus 
into 
one 
of 
the 
halls 
of 
the 
palace:whenhewas 
within,itwas 
nolongerahall,itwasaworld, 


Solemque 
suum, 
sua 
sidera 
norat. 


At 
the 
command 
of 
Pallas 
there 
came 
within 
view 
Dodona 
with 
the 
temple 


of 
Jupiter, 
and 
Sextus 
issuing 
thence; 
he 
could 
be 
heard 
saying 
that 
he 
would 
obey 
the 
God. 
And 
lo! 
he 
goes 
to 
a 
city 
lying 
between 
two 
seas, 
resembling 
Corinth. 
He 
buys 
there 
a 
small 
garden; 
cultivating 
it, 
he 
finds 
a 
treasure; 
he 
becomes 
a 
rich 
man, 
enjoying 
affection 
and 
esteem; 
he 
dies 
at 
a 
great 
age, 
beloved 
of 
the 
whole 
city. 
Theodorus 
saw 
the 
whole 
life 
of 
Sextus 
as 
at 
one 
glance, 
and 
as 
in 
a 
stage 
presentation. 
There 
was 
a 
great 
volume 
of 
writings 
in 
this 
hall: 
Theodorus 
could 
not 
refrain 
from 
asking 
whatthatmeant. 
Itisthe 
history 
of 
this 
world 
which 
we 
are 
now 
visiting, 
the 
Goddess 
told 
him; 
it 
is 
the 
book 
of 
its 
fates. 
You 
have 
seen 
a 
number 
on 
the 
forehead 
of 
Sextus. 
Look 
in 
this 
book 
for 
the 
place 
which 
it 
indicates. 
Theodorus 
looked 
for 
it, 
and 
found 
there 
the 
history 
of 
Sextus 
in 
a 
form 
more 
ample 
than 
the 
outline 
he 
had 
seen. 
Put 
your 
finger 
on 
any 
line 
you 
please, 
Pallas 
said 
to 
him, 
and 
you 
will 
see 
represented 
actually 
in 
all 
its 
detail 
that 
which 
the 
line 
broadly 
indicates. 
He 
obeyed, 
and 
he 
saw 
coming 
into 
view 
all 
the 
characteristics 
of 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
life 
of 
that 
Sextus. 
They 
passed 
into 
another 
hall, 
and 
lo! 
another 
world, 
another 
Sextus. 
who, 
issuing 
from 
the 
temple, 
and 
having 
resolved 
to 
obey 
Jupiter, 
goes 
to 
Thrace. 
There 
he 
marries 
the 
daughter 
of 
the 



king, 
who 
had 
no 
other 
children; 
he 
succeeds 
him, 
and 
he 
is 
adored 
by 
his 
subjects. 
Theywentinto 
other 
rooms, 
andalways 
theysaw 
newscenes. 


416. 
The 
halls 
rose 
in 
a 
pyramid, 
becoming 
even 
more 
beautiful 
as 
one 
mounted 
towards 
the 
apex, 
and 
representing 
more 
beautiful 
worlds. 
Finally 
they 
reached 
the 
highest 
one 
which 
completed 
the 
pyramid, 
and 
which 
was 
the 
most 
beautiful 
of 
all: 
for 
the 
pyramid 
had 
a 
beginning, 
but 
one 
could 
not 
see 
its 
end; 
it 
had 
an 
apex, 
but 
no 
base; 
it 
went 
on 
increasing 
to 
infinity. 
That 
is 
(as 
the 
Goddess 
explained) 
because 
amongst 
an 
endless 
number 
of 
possible 
worlds 
there 
is 
the 
best 
of 
all, 
else 
would 
God 
not 
have 
determined 
to 
create 
any; 
but 
there 
is 
not 
any 
one 
which 
has 
not 
also 
less 
perfect 
worlds 
below 
it: 
that 
is 
why 
the 
pyramid 
goes 
on 
descending 
to 
infinity. 
Theodorus, 
entering 
this 
highest 
hall, 
became 
entranced 
in 
ecstasy; 
he 
had 
to 
receive 
succour 
from 
the 
Goddess, 
a 
drop 
of 
a 
divine 
liquid 
placed 
on 
his 
tongue 
restored 
him; 
he 
was 
beside 
himself 
for 
joy. 
We 
are 
in 
the 
real 
true 
world 
(said 
the 
Goddess) 
and 
you 
are 
at 
the 
source 
of 
happiness. 
Behold 
what 
Jupiter 
makes 
ready 
for 
you, 
if 
you 
continue 
to 
serve 
him 
faithfully. 
Here 
is 
Sextus 
as 
he 
is, 
and 
as 
he 
will 
be 
in 
reality. 
He 
issues 
from 
the 
temple 
in 
a 
rage, 
he 
scorns 
the 
counsel 
of 
the 
Gods. 
You 
see 
him 
going 
to 
Rome, 
bringing 
confusion 
everywhere, 
violating 
the 
wife 
of 
his 
friend. 
There 
he 
is 
driven 
out 
with 
his 
father, 
beaten, 
unhappy. 
If 
Jupiter 
had 
placed 
here 
a 
Sextus 
happy 
at 
Corinth 
or 
King 
in 
Thrace, 
it 
would 
be 
no 
longer 
this 
world. 
And 
nevertheless 
he 
could 
not 
have 
failed 
to 
choose 
this 
world, 
which 
surpasses 
in 
perfection 
all 
the 
others, 
and 
which 
forms 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
pyramid. 
Else 
would 
Jupiter 
have 
renounced 
his 
wisdom, 
he 
would 
have 
banished 
me, 
me 
his 
daughter. 
You 
see 
that 
my 
father 
did 
not 
make 
Sextus 
wicked; 
he 
was 
so 
from 
all 
eternity, 
he 
was 
so 
always 
and 
freely. 
My 
father 
only 
granted 
him 
the 
existence 
which 
his 
wisdom 
could 
not 
refuse 
to 
the 
world 
where 
he 
is 
included: 
he 
made 
him 
pass 
from 
the 
region 
of 
the 
possible 
to 
that 
of 
the 
actual 
beings. 
The 
crime 
of 

Sextus 
serves 
for 
great 
things: 
it 
renders 
Rome 
free; 
thence 
will 
arise 
a 
great 
empire, 
which 
will 
show 
noble 
examples 
to 
mankind. 
But 
that 
is 
nothing 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
worth 
of 
this 
whole 
world, 
at 
whose 
beauty 
you 
will 
marvel, 
when, 
after 
a 
happy 
passage 
from 
this 
mortal 
state 
to 
another 
and 
better 
one, 
theGods 
shallhavefittedyou 
toknowit. 


417. 
At 
this 
moment 
Theodorus 
wakes 
up, 
he 
gives 
thanks 
to 
the 
Goddess, 
he 
owns 
the 
justice 
of 
Jupiter. 
His 
spirit 
pervaded 
by 
what 
he 
has 
seen 
and 
heard, 
he 
carries 
on 
the 
office 
of 
High 
Priest, 
with 
all 
the 
zeal 
of 
a 
true 
servant 
of 
his 
God, 
and 
with 
all 
the 
joy 
whereof 
a 
mortal 
is 
capable. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
continuation 
of 
the 
tale 
may 
elucidate 
the 
difficulty 
which 
Valla 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
treat. 
If 
Apollo 
has 
represented 
aright 
God’s 
knowledge 
of 
vision 
(that 
which 
concerns 
beings 
in 
existence), 
I 
hope 
that 
Pallas 
will 
have 
not 
discreditably 
filled 
the 
role 
of 
what 
is 
called 
knowledge 
of 
simple 
intelligence 
(that 
which 
embraces 
all 
that 
is 
possible), 
wherein 
at 
last 
the 
sourceofthingsmustbesought. 

APPENDICES 



SUMMARY 
OF 
THE 
CONTROVERSY 
REDUCED 
TO 
FORMAL 
ARGUMENTS 



SOME 
PERSONS 
OF 
discernment 
have 
wished 
me 
to 
make 
this 
addition. 
I 
have 
the 
more 
readily 
deferred 
to 
their 
opinion, 
because 
of 
the 
opportunity 
thereby 
gained 
for 
meeting 
certain 
difficulties, 
and 
for 
making 
observations 
on 
certain 
matters 
which 
were 
not 
treated 
in 
sufficient 
detail 
in 
the 
work 
itself.

answer 


I 
deny 
the 
minor, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
second 
premiss 
of 
this 
syllogism,

made 
a

wherein 
there 
is 
evil; 
a 
world, 
I 
say, 
which 
could 
have

ThereforeGoddidnotchoosethebestcourse. 


answer 


I 
admit 
the 
minor 
of 
this 
prosyllogism: 
for 
one 
must 
confess 
that 
there 
is 
evil 
in 
this 
world 
which 
God 
has 
made, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
have 
been 
possible 



to 
make 
a 
world 
without 
evil 
or 
even 
not 
to 
create 
any 
world, 
since 
its 
creation 
depended 
upon 
the 
free 
will 
of 
God. 
But 
I 
deny 
the 
major, 
that 
is, 
the 
first 
of 
the 
two 
premisses 
of 
the 
prosyllogism, 
and 
I 
might 
content 
myself 
withaskingforitsproof. 
In 
order, 
however, 
togiveaclearerexpositionofthe 
matter, 
I 
would 
justify 
this 
denial 
by 
pointing 
out 
that 
the 
best 
course 
is 
not 
always 
that 
one 
which 
tends 
towards 
avoiding 
evil, 
since 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
evil 
may 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
greater 
good. 
For 
example, 
the 
general 
of 
an 
army 
will 
prefer 
a 
great 
victory 
with 
a 
slight 
wound 
to 
a 
state 
of 
affairs 
without 
wound 
and 
without 
victory. 
I 
have 
proved 
this 
in 
further 
detail 
in 
this 
work 
by 
pointing 
out, 
through 
instances 
taken 
from 
mathematics 
and 
elsewhere, 
that 
an 
imperfection 
in 
the 
part 
may 
be 
required 
for 
a 
greater 
perfection 
in 
the 
whole. 
I 
have 
followed 
therein 
the 
opinion 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
who 
said 
a 
hundred 
times 
that 
God 
permitted 
evil 
in 
order 
to 
derive 
from 
it 
a 
good, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
greater 
good; 
and 
Thomas 
Aquinas 
says 
(in 
libr. 
2, 
Sent. 
Dist. 
32, 
qu. 
1, 
art. 
1) 
that 
the 
permission 
of 
evil 
tends 
towards 
the 
good 
of 
the 
universe. 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
among 
older 
writers 
the 
fall 
of 
Adam 
was 
termed 
felix 
culpa, 
a 
fortunate 
sin, 
because 
it 
had 
been 
expiated 
with 
immense 
benefit 
by 
the 
incarnation 
of 
the 
Son 
of 
God: 
for 
he 
gave 
to 
the 
universe 
something 
more 
noble 
than 
anything 
there 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
amongst 
created 
beings. 
For 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
matter 
I 
added, 
following 
the 
example 
of 
many 
good 
authors, 
that 
it 
was 
consistent 
with 
order 
and 
the 
general 
good 
for 
God 
to 
grant 
to 
certain 
of 
his 
creatures 
the 
opportunity 
to 
exercise 
their 
freedom, 
even 
when 
he 
foresaw 
that 
they 
would 
turn 
to 
evil: 
for 
God 
could 
easily 
correct 
the 
evil, 
and 
it 
was 
not 
fitting 
that 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
sin 
he 
should 
always 
act 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
way. 
It 
will 
therefore 
sufficiently 
refute 
the 
objection 
to 
show 
that 
a 
world 
with 
evil 
may 
be 
better 
than 
a 
world 
without 
evil. 
But 
I 
have 
gone 
still 
further 
in 
the 



work, 
and 
have 
even 
shown 
that 
this 
universe 
must 
be 
indeed 
better 
than 
everyotherpossible 
universe. 


objectionii 


If 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
intelligent 
creatures, 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
thangood 
inallGod’swork. 


Nowthereis 
more 
evilthan 
goodinintelligentcreatures. 


Thereforethere 
ismoreevilthangoodinallGod’s 
work. 


answer 


I 
deny 
the 
major 
and 
the 
minor 
of 
this 
conditional 
syllogism. 
As 
for 
the 
major, 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
it 
because 
this 
supposed 
inference 
from 
the 
part 
to 
the 
whole, 
from 
intelligent 
creatures 
to 
all 
creatures, 
assumes 
tacitly 
and 
without 
proof 
that 
creatures 
devoid 
of 
reason 
cannot 
be 
compared 
or 
taken 
into 
account 
with 
those 
that 
have 
reason. 
But 
why 
might 
not 
the 
surplus 
of 
good 
in 
the 
non-intelligent 
creatures 
that 
fill 
the 
world 
compensate 
for 
and 
even 
exceed 
incomparably 
the 
surplus 
of 
evil 
in 
rational 
creatures? 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
value 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
greater; 
but 
by 
way 
of 
compensation 
the 
others 
are 
incomparably 
greater 
in 
number; 
and 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
proportion 
of 
number 
and 
quantitysurpassesthatof 
value 
andquality. 


Theminoralso 
I 
cannotadmit,namely,thatthere 
ismoreevilthangoodin 
intelligent 
creatures. 
One 
need 
not 
even 
agree 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
the 
human 
kind. 
For 
it 
is 
possible, 
and 
even 
a 
very 
reasonable 
thing, 
that 
the 
glory 
and 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
blessed 
may 
be 
incomparably 
greater 
than 
the 
misery 
and 
imperfection 
of 
the 
damned, 
and 
that 
here 
the 
excellence 
of 
the 
total 
good 
in 
the 
smaller 
number 
may 
exceed 
the 
total 
evil 
which 
is 
in 
the 
greater 
number. 
The 
blessed 
draw 
near 
to 
divinity 
through 
a 
divine 
Mediator, 
so 
far 
as 
can 
belong 
to 
these 
created 
beings, 
and 
make 
such 
progress 
ingoodas 
isimpossibleforthedamned 
tomakeinevil,eventhough 



they 
should 
approach 
as 
nearly 
as 
may 
be 
the 
nature 
of 
demons. 
God 
is 
infinite, 
and 
the 
Devil 
is 
finite; 
good 
can 
and 
does 
go 
on 
ad 
infinitum, 
whereas 
evil 
has 
its 
bounds. 
It 
may 
be 
therefore, 
and 
it 
is 
probable, 
that 
there 
happens 
in 
the 
comparison 
between 
the 
blessed 
and 
the 
damned 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
I 
said 
could 
happen 
in 
the 
comparison 
between 
the 
happy 
and 
the 
unhappy, 
namely 
that 
in 
the 
latter 
the 
proportion 
of 
degrees 
surpasses 
that 
of 
numbers, 
while 
in 
the 
comparison 
between 
intelligent 
and 
non-intelligent 
the 
proportion 
of 
numbers 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
values. 
One 
is 
justified 
in 
assuming 
that 
a 
thing 
may 
be 
so 
as 
long 
as 
one 
does 
not 
prove 
that 
it 
is 
impossible,and 
indeedwhatis 
hereputforward 
goesbeyondassumption. 


But 
secondly, 
even 
should 
one 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
the 
human 
kind, 
one 
still 
has 
every 
reason 
for 
not 
admitting 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
all 
intelligent 
creatures. 
For 
there 
is 
an 
inconceivable 
number 
of 
Spirits, 
and 
perhaps 
of 
other 
rational 
creatures 
besides: 
and 
an 
opponent 
cannot 
prove 
that 
in 
the 
whole 
City 
of 
God, 
composed 
as 
much 
of 
Spirits 
as 
of 
rational 
animals 
without 
number 
and 
of 
endless 
different 
kinds, 
the 
evil 
exceeds 
the 
good. 
Although 
one 
need 
not, 
in 
order 
to 
answer 
an 
objection, 
prove 
that 
a 
thing 
is, 
when 
its 
mere 
possibility 
suffices, 
I 
have 
nevertheless 
shown 
in 
this 
present 
work 
that 
it 
is 
a 
result 
of 
the 
supreme 
perfection 
of 
the 
Sovereign 
of 
the 
Universe 
that 
the 
kingdom 
of 
God 
should 
be 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
all 
states 
or 
governments 
possible, 
and 
that 
in 
consequence 
what 
little 
evil 
there 
is 
should 
be 
required 
to 
provide 
the 
full 
measure 
ofthevastgood 
existingthere.

Iadmit 
ina

conclusionof 
the 
secondprosyllogism,which 
is 
the 
minor 
of 
the 
first; 
but 
I 
shall 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
the 
first 
prosyllogism, 
namelythat 
everythingpredeterminedis 
necessary;taking 
‘necessity’, 
saythe 
necessity 
to 
sin, 
or 
the 
impossibility 
of 
not 
sinning, 
or 
of 
not 
doing 
some 
action, 
in 
the 
sense 
relevant 
to 
the 
argument, 
that 
is, 
as 
a 
necessity 
essential 
and 
absolute, 
which 
destroys 
the 
morality 
of 
action 
and 
the 
justice 
of 
punishment. 
If 
anyone 
meant 
a 
different 
necessity 
or 
impossibility 
(that 
is, 
a 
necessity 
only 
moral 
or 
hypothetical, 
which 
will 
be 
explained 
presently) 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
we 
would 
deny 
him 
the 
major 
stated 
in 
the 
objection. 
We 
might 
content 
ourselves 
with 
this 
answer, 
and 
demand 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
proposition 
denied: 
but 
I 
am 
well 
pleased 
to 
justify 
my 
manner 
of 
procedure 
in 
the 
present 
work, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
the 
matter 
clear 
and 
to 
throw 
more 
light 
on 
this 
whole 
subject, 
by 
explaining 
the 
necessity 
that 
must 
be 
rejected 
and 
the 
determination 
that 
must 
be 
allowed. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
the 
necessity 
contrary 
to 
morality, 
which 
must 
be 
avoided 
and 
which 
would 
render 
punishment 
unjust, 
is 
an 
insuperable 
necessity, 
which 
would 
render 
all 
opposition 
unavailing, 
even 
though 
one 
should 
wish 
with 
all 
one’s 
heart 
to 
avoid 
the 
necessary 



action, 
and 
though 
one 
should 
make 
all 
possible 
efforts 
to 
that 
end. 
Now 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
this 
is 
not 
applicable 
to 
voluntary 
actions, 
since 
one 
would 
not 
do 
themifone 
did 
notsodesire. 
Thustheir 
prevision 
and 
predetermination 
is 
not 
absolute, 
but 
it 
presupposes 
will: 
if 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
one 
will 
do 
them, 
it 
is 
no 
less 
certain 
that 
one 
will 
will 
to 
do 
them. 
These 
voluntary 
actions 
and 
their 
results 
will 
not 
happen 
whatever 
one 
may 
do 
and 
whether 
one 
will 
them 
or 
not; 
but 
they 
will 
happen 
because 
one 
will 
do, 
and 
because 
one 
will 
will 
to 
do, 
that 
which 
leads 
to 
them. 
That 
is 
involved 
in 
prevision 
and 
predetermination, 
and 
forms 
the 
reason 
thereof. 
The 
necessity 
of 
such 
events 
is 
called 
conditional 
or 
hypothetical, 
or 
again 
necessity 
of 
consequence, 
because 
it 
presupposes 
the 
will 
and 
the 
other 
requisites. 
But 
the 
necessity 
which 
destroys 
morality, 
and 
renders 
punishment 
unjust 
and 
reward 
unavailing, 
is 
found 
in 
the 
things 
that 
will 
be 
whatever 
one 
may 
do 
and 
whatever 
one 
may 
will 
to 
do: 
in 
a 
word, 
it 
exists 
in 
that 
which 
is 
essential. 
This 
it 
is 
which 
is 
called 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
Thus 
it 
avails 
nothing 
with 
regard 
to 
what 
is 
necessary 
absolutely 
to 
ordain 
interdicts 
or 
commandments, 
to 
propose 
penalties 
or 
prizes, 
to 
blame 
or 
to 
praise; 
it 
will 
come 
to 
pass 
no 
more 
and 
no 
less. 
In 
voluntary 
actions, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
and 
in 
what 
depends 
upon 
them, 
precepts, 
armed 
with 
power 
to 
punish 
and 
to 
reward, 
very 
often 
serve, 
and 
are 
included 
in 
the 
order 
of 
causes 
that 
make 
action 
exist. 
Thus 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
not 
only 
pains 
and 
effort 
but 
also 
prayers 
are 
effective, 
God 
having 
had 
even 
these 
prayers 
in 
mind 
before 
he 
ordered 
things, 
and 
having 
made 
due 
allowance 
for 
them. 
That 
is 
why 
the 
precept 
Ora 
et 
labora 
(Pray 
and 
work) 
remains 
intact. 
Thus 
not 
only 
those 
who 
(under 
the 
empty 
pretext 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
events) 
maintain 
that 
one 
can 
spare 
oneself 
the 
pains 
demanded 
by 
affairs, 
but 
also 
those 
who 
argue 
against 
prayers, 
fall 
into 
that 
which 
the 
ancients 
even 
in 
their 
time 
called 
‘the 
Lazy 
Sophism’. 
So 
the 
predetermination 
of 
events 
by 
their 
causes 
is 
precisely 
what 
contributes 
to 



morality 
instead 
of 
destroying 
it, 
and 
the 
causes 
incline 
the 
will 
without 
necessitating 
it. 
For 
this 
reason 
the 
determination 
we 
are 
concerned 
with 
is 
not 
a 
necessitation. 
It 
is 
certain 
(to 
him 
who 
knows 
all) 
that 
the 
effect 
will 
follow 
this 
inclination; 
but 
this 
effect 
does 
not 
follow 
thence 
by 
a 
consequence 
which 
is 
necessary, 
that 
is, 
whose 
contrary 
implies 
contradiction; 
and 
it 
is 
also 
by 
such 
an 
inward 
inclination 
that 
the 
will 
is 
determined, 
without 
the 
presence 
of 
necessity. 
Suppose 
that 
one 
has 
the 
greatest 
possible 
passion 
(for 
example, 
a 
great 
thirst), 
you 
will 
admit 
that 
the 
soul 
can 
find 
some 
reason 
for 
resisting 
it, 
even 
if 
it 
were 
only 
that 
of 
displaying 
its 
power. 
Thus 
though 
one 
may 
never 
have 
complete 
indifference 
of 
equipoise, 
and 
there 
is 
always 
a 
predominance 
of 
inclination 
for 
the 
course 
adopted, 
that 
predominance 
does 
not 
render 
absolutely 
necessary 
the 
resolutiontaken.

of

creatures; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
so, 
and 
he 
rather 
contributes 
to 
it 
by 
his 
co-operation 
and 
by 
the 
opportunities 
he 
causes, 
although 
heisfully 
cognizant 
ofit. 


Therefore,etc. 


answer 


I 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
this 
syllogism. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
one 
can 
prevent 
the 
sin, 
but 
that 
one 
ought 
not 
to 
do 
so, 
because 
one 
could 
not 
do 
so 
without 
committing 
a 
sin 
oneself, 
or 
(when 
God 
is 
concerned) 
without 
acting 
unreasonably. 
I 
have 
given 
instances 
of 
that, 
and 
have 
applied 
them 
to 
God 
himself. 
It 
may 
be 
also 
that 
one 
contributes 
to 
the 
evil, 
and 
that 
one 
even 
opens 
the 
way 
to 
it 
sometimes, 
in 
doing 
things 
one 
is 
bound 
to 
do. 
And 
when 
one 
does 
one’s 
duty, 
or 
(speaking 
of 
God) 
when, 
after 
full 
consideration, 
one 



doesthatwhich 
reasondemands, 
oneisnotresponsibleforevents,evenwhen 
one 
foresees 
them. 
One 
does 
not 
will 
these 
evils; 
but 
one 
is 
willing 
to 
permit 
them 
for 
a 
greater 
good, 
which 
one 
cannot 
in 
reason 
help 
preferring 
to 
other 
considerations. 
This 
is 
a 
consequent 
will, 
resulting 
from 
acts 
of 
antecedent 
will, 
in 
which 
one 
wills 
the 
good. 
I 
know 
that 
some 
persons, 
in 
speaking 
of 
theantecedentand 
consequent 
will 
ofGod, 
havemeantby 
the 
antecedent 
that 
which 
wills 
that 
all 
men 
be 
saved, 
and 
by 
the 
consequent 
that 
which 
wills, 
in 
consequence 
of 
persistent 
sin, 
that 
there 
be 
some 
damned, 
damnation 
being 
a 
result 
of 
sin. 
But 
these 
are 
only 
examples 
of 
a 
more 
general 
notion, 
and 
one 
may 
say 
with 
the 
same 
reason, 
that 
God 
wills 
by 
his 
antecedent 
will 
that 
men 
sin 
not, 
and 
that 
by 
his 
consequent 
or 
final 
and 
decretory 
will 
(which 
is 
always 
followed 
by 
its 
effect) 
he 
wills 
to 
permit 
that 
they 
sin, 
this 
permission 
being 
a 
result 
of 
superior 
reasons. 
One 
has 
indeed 
justification 
for 
saying, 
in 
general, 
that 
the 
antecedent 
will 
of 
God 
tends 
towards 
the 
production 
of 
good 
and 
the 
prevention 
of 
evil, 
each 
taken 
in 
itself, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
detached 
(particulariter 
et 
secundum 
quid: 
Thom. 
I, 
qu. 
19, 
art. 
6) 
according 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
each 
good 
or 
of 
each 
evil. 
Likewise 
one 
may 
say 
that 
the 
consequent, 
or 
final 
and 
total, 
divine 
will 
tends 
towards 
the 
production 
of 
as 
many 
goods 
as 
can 
be 
put 
together, 
whose 
combination 
thereby 
becomes 
determined, 
and 
involves 
also 
the 
permission 
of 
some 
evils 
and 
the 
exclusion 
of 
some 
goods, 
as 
the 
best 
possible 
plan 
of 
the 
universe 
demands. 
Arminius, 
in 
his 
Antiperkinsus, 
explained 
very 
well 
that 
the 
will 
of 
God 
can 
be 
called 
consequent 
not 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
action 
of 
the 
creature 
considered 
beforehand 
in 
the 
divine 
understanding, 
but 
also 
in 
relation 
to 
other 
anterior 
acts 
of 
divine 
will. 
But 
it 
is 
enough 
to 
consider 
the 
passage 
cited 
from 
Thomas 
Aquinas, 
and 
that 
from 
Scotus 
(I, 
dist. 
46, 
qu. 
11), 
to 
see 
that 
they 
make 
this 
distinction 
as 
I 
have 
made 
it 
here. 
Nevertheless 
if 
anyone 
will 
not 
suffer 
this 
use 
of 
the 
terms, 
let 
him 
put 
‘previous’ 
in 
place 
of 



‘antecedent’ 
will, 
and 
‘final’ 
or 
‘decretory’ 
in 
place 
of 
‘consequent’ 
will.

answer 


I 
might 
content 
myself 
with 
denying 
the 
major 
or 
the 
minor, 
because 
the 
term 
‘real’ 
admits 
of 
interpretations 
capable 
of 
rendering 
these 
propositions 
false. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
give 
a 
better 
explanation 
I 
will 
make 
a 
distinction. 
‘Real’ 
either 
signifies 
that 
which 
is 
positive 
only, 
or 
else 
it 
includes 
also 
privative 
beings: 
in 
the 
first 
case, 
I 
deny 
the 
major 
and 
I 
admit 
the 
minor; 
in 
the 
second 
case, 
I 
do 
the 
opposite. 
I 
might 
have 
confined 
myself 
to 
that; 
but 
I 
was 
willing 
to 
go 
further, 
in 
order 
to 
account 
for 
this 
distinction. 
I 
have 
therefore 
been 
well 
pleased 
to 
point 
out 
that 
every 
purely 
positive 
or 
absolute 
reality 
is 
a 
perfection, 
and 
that 
everyimperfection 
comes 
fromlimitation, 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
privative: 
for 
to 
limit 
is 
to 
withhold 
extension, 
or 
the 
more 
beyond. 
Now 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
perfections, 
and 
consequently 
of 
all 
realities, 
when 
they 
are 
regarded 
as 
purely 
positive. 
But 
limitations 
or 
privations 
result 
from 
the 
original 
imperfection 
of 
creatures 
which 
restricts 
their 
receptivity. 
It 
is 
as 
with 
a 
laden 
boat, 
which 
the 
river 
carries 
along 
more 
slowly 
or 
less 
slowly 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
weight 
that 
it 
bears: 
thus 
the 
speed 
comes 
from 
the 
river, 
but 
the 
retardation 
which 
restricts 
this 
speed 
comes 
from 
the 
load. 
Also 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
the 
present 
work 
how 
the 
creature, 
in 
causing 
sin, 
is 
a 
deficient 
cause; 
how 
errors 
and 
evil 
inclinations 
spring 
from 
privation; 
and 
how 
privation 
is 
efficacious 
accidentally. 
And 
I 
have 
justified 
the 
opinion 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
(lib. 
I, 
Ad. 
Simpl. 
qu. 
2) 
who 
explains 
(for 



example) 
how 
God 
hardens 
the 
soul, 
not 
in 
giving 
it 
something 
evil, 
but 
because 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
good 
he 
imprints 
is 
restricted 
by 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
by 
the 
circumstances 
contributing 
to 
this 
resistance, 
so 
that 
he 
does 
not 
give 
it 
all 
the 
good 
that 
would 
overcome 
its 
evil. 
‘Nec 
(inquit) 
ab 
illo 
erogatur 
aliquid 
quo 
homo 
fit 
deterior, 
sed 
tantum 
quo 
fit 
melior 
non 
erogatur.’ 
But 
if 
God 
had 
willed 
to 
do 
more 
here 
he 
must 
needs 
have 
produced 
either 
fresh 
natures 
in 
his 
creatures 
or 
fresh 
miracles 
to 
change 
their 
natures, 
and 
this 
the 
best 
plan 
did 
not 
allow. 
It 
is 
just 
as 
if 
the 
current 
of 
the 
river 
must 
needs 
be 
more 
rapid 
than 
its 
slope 
permits 
or 
the 
boats 
themselves 
be 
less 
laden, 
if 
they 
had 
to 
be 
impelled 
at 
a 
greater 
speed. 
So 
the 
limitation 
or 
original 
imperfection 
of 
creatures 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
even 
the 
best 
plan 
of 
the 
universe 
cannot 
admit 
more 
good, 
and 
cannot 
be 
exempted 
from 
certain 
evils,these, 
however,beingonlyofsuchakind 
asmaytend 
towards 
agreater 
good. 
There 
are 
some 
disorders 
in 
the 
parts 
which 
wonderfully 
enhance 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
whole, 
just 
as 
certain 
dissonances, 
appropriately 
used, 
render 
harmony 
more 
beautiful. 
But 
that 
depends 
upon 
the 
answer 
which 
I 
have 
alreadygiventothefirst 
objection.

Goddoesso. 


Therefore,etc. 


answer 


I 
deny 
the 
minor 
of 
this 
argument. 
And 
I 
believe 
that 
God 
always 
gives 
sufficient 
aid 
and 
grace 
to 
those 
who 
have 
good 
will, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
who 
do 
not 
reject 
this 
grace 
by 
a 
fresh 
sin. 
Thus 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
the 
damnation 
of 
children 
dying 
unbaptized 
or 
outside 
the 
Church, 
or 
the 
damnation 
of 
adult 
personswhohave 
actedaccording 
to 
the

Godhas 
given 
them. 
And 
I 



believe 
that, 
if 
anyone 
has 
followed 
the 
light 
he 
had, 
he 
will 
undoubtedly 
receive 
thereof 
in 
greater 
measure 
as 
he 
has 
need, 
even 
as 
the 
late 
Herr 
Hulsemann, 
who 
was 
celebrated 
as 
a 
profound 
theologian 
at 
Leipzig, 
has 
somewhere 
observed; 
and

such 
a 
man 
had 
failed 
to 
receive

andfinalsavingfaithhasnotenoughgoodness. 


Goddoesso. 


Therefore,etc. 


answer 


I 
deny 
the 
major. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
God 
could 
overcome 
the 
greatest 
resistance 
of 
the 
human 
heart, 
and 
indeed 
he 
sometimes 
does 
so, 
whether 
by 
an 
inward 
grace 
or 
by 
the 
outward 
circumstances 
that 
can 
greatly 
influence 
souls; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
always 
do 
so. 
Whence 
comes 
this 
distinction, 
someone 
will 
say, 
and 
wherefore 
does 
his 
goodness 
appear 
to 
be 
restricted? 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
in 
order 
always 
to 
act 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
way 
and 
to 
derange 
the 
connexion 
of 
things, 
as 
I 
have 
observed 
already 
in 
answering 
the 
first 
objection. 
The 
reasons 
for 
this 
connexion, 
whereby 
the 
one 
is 
placed 
in 
more 
favourable 
circumstances 
than 
the 
other, 
are 
hidden 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
God’s 
wisdom:they 
depend 
upon 
the 
universal 
harmony. 
The 
bestplan 
of 
the 
universe, 
which 
God 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
choose, 
required 
this. 
One 
concludes 
thus 
from 
the 
event 
itself; 
since 
God 
made 
the 
universe, 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
to 
do 
better. 
Such 
management, 
far 
from 
being 
contrary 
to 
goodness, 
has 
rather 
been 
prompted 
by 
supreme 
goodness 
itself. 
This 
objection 
with 
its 
solution 
might 
have 
been 
inferred 
from 
what 
was 
said 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
first 
objection;butitseemedadvisabletotouch

objectionviii 



Whoevercannot

choosethebestisnotfree. 


Godcannotfailtochoosethebest. 


ThereforeGodisnotfree. 


answer 


I 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
this 
argument. 
Rather 
is 
it 
true 
freedom, 
and 
the 
most 
perfect, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
make 
the 
best 
use 
of 
one’s 
free 
will, 
and 
always 
to 
exercise 
this 
power, 
without 
being 
turned 
aside 
either 
by 
outward 
force 
or 
by 
inward 
passions, 
whereof 
the 
one 
enslaves 
our 
bodies 
and 
the 
other 
our 
souls. 
There 
is 
nothing 
less 
servile 
and 
more 
befitting 
the 
highest 
degree 
of 
freedom 
than 
to 
be 
always 
led 
towards 
the 
good, 
and 
always 
by 
one’s 
own 
inclination, 
without 
any 
constraint 
and 
without 
any 
displeasure. 
And 
to 
object 
that 
God 
therefore 
had 
need 
of 
external 
things 
is 
only 
a 
sophism. 
He 
creates 
them 
freely: 
but 
when 
he 
had 
set 
before 
him 
an 
end, 
that 
of 
exercising 
his 
goodness, 
his 
wisdom 
determined 
him 
to 
choose 
the 
means 
most 
appropriate 
for 
obtaining 
this 
end. 
To 
call 
that 
a 
need 
is 
to 
take 
the 
term 
in 
a 
sense 
not 
usual, 
which 
clears 
it 
of 
all 
imperfection, 
somewhat 
as 
one 
does 
when 
speakingofthewrathofGod. 


Seneca 
says 
somewhere, 
that 
God 
commanded 
only 
once, 
but 
that 
he 
obeys 
always, 
because 
he 
obeys 
the 
laws 
that 
he 
willed 
to 
ordain 
for 
himself: 
semel 
jussit, 
semper 
paret. 
But 
he 
had 
better 
have 
said, 
that 
God 
always 
commands 
and 
that 
he 
is 
always 
obeyed: 
for 
in 
willing 
he 
always 
follows 
the 
tendency 
of 
his 
own 
nature, 
and 
all 
other 
things 
always 
follow 
his 
will. 
And 
as 
this 
will 
is 
always 
the 
same 
one 
cannot 
say 
that 
he 
obeys 
that 
will 
only 
which 
he 
formerly 
had. 
Nevertheless, 
although 
his 
will 
is 
always 
indefectible 
and 
always 
tendstowards 
the 
best, 
theevilorthe 
lesser 
goodwhich 
herejects 
will 
still 
be 
possible 
in 
itself. 
Otherwise 
the 
necessity 
of 
good 
would 
be 
geometrical 
(so 
to 
speak) 
or 
metaphysical, 
and 
altogether 
absolute; 
the 
contingency 
of 
things 
would 
be 
destroyed, 
and 
there 
would 
be 
no 
choice. 
But 



necessity 
of 
this 
kind, 
which 
does 
not 
destroy 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
contrary, 
has 
the 
name 
by 
analogy 
only: 
it 
becomes 
effective 
not 
through 
the 
mere 
essence 
of 
things, 
but 
through 
that 
which 
is 
outside 
them 
and 
above 
them, 
that 
is, 
through 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
This 
necessity 
is 
called 
moral, 
because 
for 
the 
wise 
what 
is 
necessary 
and 
what 
is 
owing 
are 
equivalent 
things; 
and 
when 
it 
is 
always 
followed 
by 
its 
effect, 
as 
it 
indeed 
is 
in 
the 
perfectly 
wise, 
that 
is, 
in 
God, 
one 
can 
say 
that 
it 
is 
a 
happy 
necessity. 
The 
more 
nearly 
creatures 
approach 
this, 
the 
closer 
do 
they 
come 
to 
perfect 
felicity. 
Moreover, 
necessity 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
not 
the 
necessity 
one 
endeavours 
to 
avoid, 
and 
which 
destroys 
morality, 
reward 
and 
commendation. 
For 
that 
which 
it 
brings 
to 
pass 
does 
not 
happen 
whatever 
one 
may 
do 
and 
whatever 
one 
may 
will, 
but 
because 
one 
desires 
it. 
A 
will 
to 
which 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
choose 
well 
deserves 
most 
to 
be 
commended; 
and 
it 
carries 
with 
it 
its 
own 
reward, 
which 
is 
supreme 
happiness. 
And 
as 
this 
constitution 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
gives 
an 
entire 
satisfaction 
to 
him 
who 
possesses 
it, 
it 
is 
also 
the 
best 
and 
the 
most 
desirable 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
creatures 
who 
are 
all 
dependent 
upon 
God. 
If 
the 
will 
of 
God 
had 
not 
as 
its 
rule 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
best, 
it 
would 
tend 
towards 
evil, 
which 
would 
be 
worst 
of 
all; 
or 
else 
it 
would 
be 
indifferent 
somehow 
to 
good 
and 
to 
evil, 
and 
guided 
by 
chance. 
But 
a 
will 
that 
would 
always 
drift 
along 
at 
random 
would 
scarcely 
be 
any 
better 
for 
the 
government 
of 
the 
universe 
than 
the 
fortuitous 
concourse 
of 
corpuscles, 
without 
the 
existence 
of 
divinity. 
And 
even 
though 
God 
should 
abandon 
himself 
to 
chance 
only 
in 
some 
cases, 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
(as 
he 
would 
if 
he 
did 
not 
always 
tend 
entirely 
towards 
the 
best, 
and 
if 
he 
were 
capable 
of 
preferring 
a 
lesser 
good 
to 
a 
greater 
good, 
that 
is, 
an 
evil 
to 
a 
good, 
since 
that 
which 
prevents 
a 
greater 
good 
is 
an 
evil) 
he 
would 
be 
no 
less 
imperfect 
than 
the 
object 
of 
his 
choice. 
Then 
he 
would 
not 
deserve 
absolute 
trust; 
he 
would 
act 
without 
reason 
in 
such 
a 
case, 
and 
the 
government 
of 
the 
universe 
would 
be 



like 
certain 
games 
equally 
divided 
between 
reason 
and 
luck. 
This 
all 
proves 
that 
this 
objection 
which 
is 
made 
against 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
best 
perverts 
the 
notions 
of 
free 
and 
necessary, 
and 
represents 
the 
best 
to 
us 
actually 
as 
evil: 
butthatiseither 
malicious 
orabsurd. 



EXCURSUS 
ON 
THEODICY 


§392 



publishedbytheauthorinMémoiresdeTrévoux 


July 
1712 


February 
1712 


I 
said 
in 
my 
essays, 
§ 
392, 
that 
I 
wished 
to 
see 
the 
demonstrations 
mentioned 
by 
M. 
Bayle 
and 
contained 
in 
the 
sixth 
letter 
printed 
at 
Trévoux 
in 
1703. 
Father 
des 
Bosses 
has 
shown 
me 
this 
letter, 
in 
which 
the 
writer 
essays 
to 
demonstrate 
by 
the 
geometrical 
method 
that 
God 
is 
the 
sole 
true 
cause 
of 
all 
that 
is 
real. 
My 
perusal 
of 
it 
has 
confirmed 
me 
in 
the 
opinion 
which 
I 
indicated 
in 
the 
same 
passage, 
namely, 
that 
this 
proposition 
can 
be 
true 
in 
a 
very 
good 
sense, 
God 
being 
the 
only 
cause 
of 
pure 
and 
absolute 
realities, 
or 
perfections; 
but 
when 
one 
includes 
limitations 
or 
privations 
under 
the 
name 
of 
realities 
one 
can 
say 
that 
second 
causes 
co-operate 
in 
the 
production 
of 
what 
is 
limited, 
and 
that 
otherwise 
God 
would 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
sin, 
and 
even 
its 
sole 
cause. 
And 
I 
am 
somewhat 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
the 
gifted 
author 
of 
the 
letter 
does 
not 
greatly 
differ 
in 
opinion 
from 
me, 
although 
he 
seems 
to 
include 
all 
modalities 
among 
the 
realities 
of 
which 
he 
declares 
God 
to 
be 
the 
sole 
cause. 
For 
in 
actual 
fact 
I 
think 
he 
will 
not 
admit 
that 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
and 
the 
author 
of 
sin. 
Indeed, 
he 
explains 
himself 
in 
a 
manner 
which 
seems 
to 
overthrow 
his 
thesis 
and 
to 
grant 
real 
action 
to 
creatures. 
For 
in 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
eighth 
corollary 
of 
his 
second 
proposition 
these 
words 
occur: 
‘The 
natural 
motion 
of 
the 
soul, 
although 
determinate 
in 
itself, 
is 
indeterminate 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
objects. 
For 
it 
is 
love 
of 
good 
in 
general. 
It 
is 
through 
the 
ideas 
of 
good 



appearing 
in 
individual 
objects 
that 
this 
motion 
becomes 
individual 
and 
determinate 
in 
relation 
to 
those 
objects. 
And 
thus 
as 
the 
mind 
has 
the 
power 
of 
varying 
its 
own 
ideasitcanalsochange 
thedeterminationsofits 
love. 
And 
for 
that 
purpose 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
overcome 
the 
power 
of 
God 
or 
oppose 
his 
action. 
These 
determinations 
of 
motion 
towards 
individual 
objects 
are 
not 
invincible. 
It 
is 
this 
noninvincibility 
which 
causes 
the 
mind 
to 
be 
free 
and 
capable 
of 
changing 
them; 
but 
after 
all 
the 
mind 
makes 
these 
changes 
only 
through 
the 
motion 
which 
God 
gives 
to 
it 
and 
conserves 
for 
it.’ 
In 
my 
own 
style 
I 
would 
have 
said 
that 
the 
perfection 
which 
is 
in 
the 
action 
of 
the 
creature 
comes 
from 
God, 
but 
that 
the 
limitations 
to 
be 
found 
there 
are 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
original 
limitation 
and 
the 
preceding 
limitations 
that 
occurred 
in 
the 
creature. 
Further, 
this 
is 
so 
not 
only 
in 
minds 
but 
also 
in 
all 
other 
substances, 
which 
thereby 
are 
causes 
co-operating 
in 
the 
change 
which 
comes 
to 
pass 
in 
themselves; 
for 
this 
determination 
of 
which 
the 
author 
speaksisnothingbutalimitation. 


Now 
if 
after 
that 
one 
reviews 
all 
the 
demonstrations 
or 
corollaries 
of 
the 
letter, 
one 
will 
be 
able 
to 
admit 
or 
reject 
the 
majority 
of 
its 
assertions, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
interpretation 
one 
may 
make 
of 
them. 
If 
by 
‘reality’ 
one 
means 
only 
perfections 
or 
positive 
realities, 
God 
is 
the 
only 
true 
cause; 
but 
if 
that 
which 
involves 
limitations 
is 
included 
under 
the 
realities, 
one 
will 
deny 
a 
considerable 
portion 
of 
the 
theses, 
and 
the 
author 
himself 
will 
have 
shown 
us 
the 
example. 
It 
is 
in 
order 
to 
render 
the 
matter 
more 
comprehensible 
that 
I 
used 
in 
the 
Essays 
the 
example 
of 
a 
laden 
boat, 
which, 
the 
more 
laden 
it 
is, 
is 
the 
more 
slowly 
carried 
along 
by 
the 
stream. 
There 
one 
sees 
clearly 
that 
the 
stream 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
what 
is 
positive 
in 
this 
motion, 
of 
the 
perfection, 
the 
force, 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
boat, 
but 
that 
the 
load 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
restriction 
of 
this 
force,and 
thatitbringsabouttheretardation. 



It 
is 
praiseworthy 
in 
anyone 
to 
attempt 
to 
apply 
the 
geometrical 
method 
to 
metaphysical 
matters. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
hitherto 
success 
has 
seldom 
been 
attained: 
and 
M. 
Descartes 
himself, 
with 
all 
that 
very 
great 
skill 
which 
one 
cannot 
deny 
in 
him, 
never 
perhaps 
had 
less 
success 
than 
when 
he 
essayed 
to 
do 
this 
in 
one 
of 
his 
answers 
to 
objections. 
For 
in 
mathematics 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
succeed, 
because 
numbers, 
figures 
and 
calculations 
make 
good 
the 
defectsconcealedinwords;butinmetaphysics,where 
oneisdeprivedofthis 
aid 
(at 
least 
in 
ordinary 
argumentation), 
the 
strictness 
employed 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
argument 
and 
in 
the 
exact 
definitions 
of 
the 
terms 
must 
needs 
supply 
this 
lack. 
But 
in 
neither 
argument 
nor 
definition 
is 
that 
strictness 
here 
to 
be 
seen. 


The 
author 
of 
the 
letter, 
who 
undoubtedly 
displays 
much 
ardour 
and 
penetration, 
sometimes 
goes 
a 
little 
too 
far, 
as 
when 
he 
claims 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
is 
as 
much 
reality 
and 
force 
in 
rest 
as 
in 
motion, 
according 
to 
the 
fifth 
corollary 
of 
the 
second 
proposition. 
He 
asserts 
that 
the 
will 
of 
God 
is 
no 
less 
positive 
in 
rest 
than 
in 
motion, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
not 
less 
invincible. 
Be 
it 
so, 
but 
does 
it 
follow 
that 
there 
is 
as 
much 
reality 
and 
force 
in 
each 
of 
the 
two? 
I 
do 
not 
see 
this 
conclusion, 
and 
with 
the 
same 
argument 
one 
would 
prove 
that 
there 
is 
as 
much 
force 
in 
a 
strong 
motion 
as 
in 
a 
weak 
motion. 
God 
in 
willing 
rest 
wills 
that 
the 
body 
be 
at 
the 
place 
A, 
where 
it 
was 
immediately 
before, 
and 
for 
that 
it 
suffices 
that 
there 
be 
no 
reason 
to 
prompt 
God 
to 
the 
change. 
But 
when 
God 
wills 
that 
afterwards 
the 
body 
be 
at 
the 
place 
B, 
there 
must 
needs 
be 
a 
new 
reason, 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
as 
to 
determine 
God 
to 
will 
that 
it 
be 
in 
B 
and 
not 
in 
C 
or 
in 
any 
other 
place, 
and 
that 
it 
be 
there 
more 
or 
less 
promptly. 
It 
is 
upon 
these 
reasons, 
the 
volitions 
of 
God, 
that 
we 
must 
assess 
theforceandthereality 
existentinthings. 
Theauthorspeaksmuchof 
thewill 
of 
God, 
but 
he 
does 
not 
speak 
much 
in 
this 
letter 
of 
the 
reasons 
which 
prompt 



God 
to 
will, 
and 
upon 
which 
all 
depends. 
And 
these 
reasons 
are 
taken 
from 
theobjects. 


I 
observe 
first, 
indeed, 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
second 
corollary 
of 
the 
first 
proposition, 
that 
it 
is 
very 
true, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
not 
very 
well 
proven. 
The 
writer 
affirms 
that 
if 
God 
only 
ceased 
to 
will 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
being, 
that 
being 
would 
nolongerexist;andhereisthe 
proof 
given 
word 
for 
word: 


‘Demonstration. 
Thatwhichexistsonly 
bythewillof 
Godnolongerexists 
once 
that 
will 
has 
ceased.’ 
(But 
that 
is 
what 
must 
be 
proved. 
The 
writer 
endeavours 
to 
prove 
it 
by 
adding:) 
‘Remove 
the 
cause, 
you 
remove 
the 
effect.’ 
(This 
maxim 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
placed 
among 
the 
axioms 
which 
are 
stated 
at 
the 
beginning. 
But 
unhappily 
this 
axiom 
may 
be 
reckoned 
among 
thoserulesofphilosophywhichare 
subjecttomanyexceptions.) 
‘Nowby 
the 
preceding 
proposition 
and 
by 
its 
first 
corollary 
no 
being 
exists 
save 
by 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
Therefore, 
etc.’ 
There 
is 
ambiguity 
in 
this 
expression, 
that 
nothingexistssavebythewillofGod. 
Ifone 
meansthatthingsbegintoexist 
only 
through 
this 
will, 
one 
is 
justified 
in 
referring 
to 
the 
preceding 
propositions; 
but 
if 
one 
means 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
things 
is 
at 
all 
times 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
one 
assumes 
more 
or 
less 
what 
is 
in 
question. 
Therefore 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
prove 
first 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
things 
dependsuponthewillofGod, 
andthatitisnotonlyamereeffectofthatwill, 
but 
a 
dependence, 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
perfection 
which 
things 
contain; 
and 
once 
that 
is 
assumed, 
they 
will 
depend 
upon 
God’s 
will 
no 
less 
afterwards 
thanatthe 
beginning. 
Thatis 
the 
wayIhavetakenthematterin 
myEssays. 


Nevertheless 
I 
recognize 
that 
the 
letter 
upon 
which 
I 
have 
just 
made 
observations 
is 
admirable 
and 
well 
deserving 
of 
perusal, 
and 
that 
it 
contains 
noble 
and 
true 
sentiments, 
provided 
it 
be 
taken 
in 
the 
sense 
I 
have 
just 
indicated. 
And 
arguments 
in 
this 
form 
may 
serve 
as 
an

REFLEXIONS 
ON 
THE 
WORK 
THAT 
MR. 
HOBBES 
PUBLISHED 
IN 
ENGLISH 
ON 
‘FREEDOM, 
NECESSITY 
AND 
CHANCE’ 



1. 
AS 
THE 
question 
of 
Necessity 
and 
Freedom, 
with 
other 
questions 
depending 
thereon, 
was 
at 
one 
time 
debated 
between 
the 
famous 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
and 
Dr. 
John 
Bramhall, 
Bishop 
of 
Derry, 
in 
books 
published 
by 
each 
of 
them, 
I 
have 
deemed 
it 
appropriate 
to 
give 
a 
clear 
account 
of 
them 
(although 
I 
have 
already 
mentioned 
them 
more 
than 
once); 
and 
this 
all 
the 
more 
since 
these 
writings 
of 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
have 
hitherto 
only 
appeared 
in 
English, 
and 
since 
the 
works 
of 
this 
author 
usually 
contain 
something 
good 
and 
ingenious. 
The 
Bishop 
of 
Derry 
and 
Mr. 
Hobbes, 
having 
met 
in 
Paris 
at 
the 
house 
of 
the 
Marquis, 
afterwards 
Duke, 
of 
Newcastle 
in 
the 
year 
1646, 
entered 
into 
a 
discussion 
on 
this 
subject. 
The 
dispute 
was 
conducted 
with 
extreme 
restraint; 
but 
the 
bishop 
shortly 
afterwards 
sent 
a 
note 
to 
My 
Lord 
Newcastle, 
desiring 
him 
to 
induce 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
to 
answer 
it. 
He 
answered; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
expressed 
a 
wish 
that 
his 
answer 
should 
not 
be 
published, 
because 
he 
believed 
it 
possible 
for 
ill-instructed 
persons 
to 
abuse 
dogmas 
such 
as 
his, 
however 
true 
they 
might 
be. 
It 
so 
happened, 
however, 
that 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
himself 
passed 
it 
to 
a 
French 
friend, 
and 
allowed 
a 
young 
Englishman 
to 
translate 
it 
into 
French 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
this 
friend. 
This 
young 
man 
kept 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
English 
original, 
and 
published 
it 
later 
in 
England 
without 
the 
author’s 
knowledge. 
Thus 
the 
bishop 
was 
obliged 
to 
reply 
to 
it, 
and 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
to 
make 
a 
rejoinder, 
and 
to 
publish 
all 
the 
pieces 
together 
in 
a 
book 
of 
348 
pages 
printed 
in 
London 
in 
the 
year 
1656, 
in 
4to. 
entitled, 
Questions 
concerning 
Freedom, 
Necessity 
and 
Chance, 
elucidated 
and 
discussed 
between 
Doctor 
Bramhall, 
Bishop 
of 
Derry, 
and 
Thomas 
Hobbes 
of 

Malmesbury. 
There 
is 
a 
later 
edition, 
of 
the 
year 
1684, 
in 
a 
work 
entitled 
Hobbes’s 
Tripos, 
where 
are 
to 
be 
found 
his 
book 
on 
human 
nature, 
his 
treatise 
on 
the 
body 
politic 
and 
his 
treatise 
on 
freedom 
and 
necessity; 
but 
the 
latter 
does 
not 
contain 
the 
bishop’s 
reply, 
nor 
the 
author’s 
rejoinder. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
argues 
on 
this 
subject 
with 
his 
usual 
wit 
and 
subtlety; 
but 
it 
is 
a 
pity 
that 
in 
both 
the 
one 
and 
the 
other 
we 
stumble 
upon 
petty 
tricks, 
such 
as 
arise 
in 
excitement 
over 
the 
game. 
The 
bishop 
speaks 
with 
much 
vehemence 
and 
behaves 
somewhat 
arrogantly. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
for 
his 
part 
is 
not 
disposed 
to 
spare 
the 
other, 
and 
manifests 
rather 
too 
much 
scorn 
for 
theology, 
and 
for 
the 
terminologyoftheSchoolmen,which 
isapparently 
favouredbythebishop. 


2. 
One 
must 
confess 
that 
there 
is 
something 
strange 
and 
indefensible 
in 
the 
opinions 
of 
Mr. 
Hobbes. 
He 
maintains 
that 
doctrines 
touching 
the 
divinity 
depend 
entirely 
upon 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
sovereign, 
and 
that 
God 
is 
no 
more 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
good 
than 
of 
the 
bad 
actions 
of 
creatures. 
He 
maintains 
that 
all 
that 
which 
God 
does 
is 
just, 
because 
there 
is 
none 
above 
him 
with 
power 
to 
punish 
and 
constrain 
him. 
Yet 
he 
speaks 
sometimes 
as 
if 
what 
is 
said 
about 
God 
were 
only 
compliments, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
expressions 
proper 
for 
paying 
him 
honour, 
but 
not 
for 
knowing 
him. 
He 
testifies 
also 
that 
it 
seems 
to 
him 
that 
the 
pains 
of 
the 
wicked 
must 
end 
in 
their 
destruction: 
this 
opinion 
closely 
approaches 
that 
of 
the 
Socinians, 
but 
it 
seems 
that 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
goes 
much 
further. 
His 
philosophy, 
which 
asserts 
that 
bodies 
alone 
are 
substances, 
hardly 
appears 
favourable 
to 
the 
providence 
of 
God 
and 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul. 
On 
other 
subjects 
nevertheless 
he 
says 
very 
reasonable 
things. 
He 
shows 
clearly 
that 
nothing 
comes 
about 
by 
chance, 
or 
rather 
that 
chance 
only 
signifies 
the 
ignorance 
of 
causes 
that 
produce 
the 
effect, 
and 
that 
for 
each 
effect 
there 
must 
be 
a 
concurrence 
of 
all 
the 
sufficient 
conditions 
anterior 
to 
the 
event, 
not 
one 
of 
which, 
manifestly, 
can 
be 
lacking 
when 
the 
event 
is 
to 
follow, 
because 
they 
are 
conditions: 
the 
event, 
moreover, 
does 
not 
fail 
to 

follow 
when 
these 
conditions 
exist 
all 
together, 
because 
they 
are 
sufficient 
conditions. 
All 
which 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
as 
I 
have 
said 
so 
many 
times, 
that 
everything 
comes 
to 
pass 
as 
a 
result 
of 
determining 
reasons, 
the 
knowledge 
whereof, 
if 
we 
had 
it, 
would 
make 
us 
know 
at 
the 
same 
time 
why 
the 
thing 
hashappenedand 
whyitdid 
not 
gootherwise. 


3. 
But 
this 
author’s 
humour, 
which 
prompts 
him 
to 
paradoxes 
and 
makes 
him 
seek 
to 
contradict 
others, 
has 
made 
him 
draw 
out 
exaggerated 
and 
odious 
conclusions 
and 
expressions, 
as 
if 
everything 
happened 
through 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
The 
Bishop 
of 
Derry, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
has 
aptly 
observed 
in 
the 
answerto 
article35,page 
327, 
thatthereresultsonlya 
hypotheticalnecessity, 
such 
as 
we 
all 
grant 
to 
events 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
God, 
while 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
maintains 
that 
even 
divine 
foreknowledge 
alone 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
establish 
an 
absolute 
necessity 
of 
events. 
This 
was 
also 
the 
opinion 
of 
Wyclif, 
and 
even 
of 
Luther, 
when 
he 
wrote 
De 
Servo 
Arbitrio; 
or 
at 
least 
they 
spoke 
so. 
But 
it 
is 
sufficiently 
acknowledged 
to-day 
that 
this 
kind 
of 
necessity 
which 
is 
termed 
hypothetical, 
and 
springs 
from 
foreknowledge 
or 
from 
other 
anterior 
reasons, 
has 
nothing 
in 
it 
to 
arouse 
one’s 
alarm: 
whereas 
it 
would 
be 
quite 
otherwise 
if 
the 
thing 
were 
necessary 
of 
itself, 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
contrary 
implied 
contradiction. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
refuses 
to 
listen 
to 
anything 
about 
a 
moral 
necessity 
either, 
on 
the 
ground 
that 
everything 
really 
happens 
through 
physical 
causes. 
But 
one 
is 
nevertheless 
justified 
in 
making 
a 
great 
difference 
between 
the 
necessity 
which 
constrains 
the 
wise 
to 
do 
good, 
and 
which 
is 
termed 
moral, 
existing 
even 
in 
relation 
to 
God, 
and 
that 
blind 
necessity 
whereby 
according 
to 
Epicurus, 
Strato, 
Spinoza, 
and 
perhaps 
Mr. 
Hobbes, 
things 
exist 
without 
intelligence 
and 
without 
choice, 
and 
consequently 
without 
God. 
Indeed, 
there 
would 
according 
to 
them 
be 
no 
need 
of 
God, 
since 
in 
consequence 
of 
this 
necessity 
all 
would 
have 
existence 
through 
its 
own 
essence, 
just 
as 
necessarily 
as 
two 

and 
three 
make 
five. 
And 
this 
necessity 
is 
absolute, 
because 
everything 
it 
carries 
with 
it 
must 
happen, 
whatever 
one 
may 
do; 
whereas 
what 
happens 
by 
a 
hypothetical 
necessity 
happens 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
supposition 
that 
this 
or 
that 
has 
been 
foreseen 
or 
resolved, 
or 
done 
beforehand; 
and 
moral 
necessity 
contains 
an 
obligation 
imposed 
by 
reason, 
which 
is 
always 
followed 
by 
its 
effect 
in 
the 
wise. 
This 
kind 
of 
necessity 
is 
happy 
and 
desirable, 
when 
one 
is 
promptedbygood 
reasons 
toactasonedoes;butnecessityblindandabsolute 
would 
subvertpietyand 
morality. 


4. 
There 
is 
more 
reason 
in 
Mr. 
Hobbes’s 
discourse 
when 
he 
admits 
that 
our 
actions 
are 
in 
our 
power, 
so 
that 
we 
do 
that 
which 
we 
will 
when 
we 
have 
the 
power 
to 
do 
it, 
and 
when 
there 
is 
no 
hindrance. 
He 
asserts 
notwithstanding 
that 
our 
volitions 
themselves 
are 
not 
so 
within 
our 
power 
that 
we 
can 
give 
ourselves, 
without 
difficulty 
and 
according 
to 
our 
good 
pleasure, 
inclinations 
and 
wills 
which 
we 
might 
desire. 
The 
bishop 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
taken 
notice 
of 
this 
reflexion, 
which 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
also 
does 
not 
develop 
enough. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
we 
have 
some 
power 
also 
over 
our 
volitions, 
but 
obliquely, 
and 
not 
absolutely 
and 
indifferently. 
This 
has 
been 
explained 
in 
some 
passages 
of 
this 
work. 
Finally 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
shows, 
like 
others 
before 
him, 
that 
the 
certainty 
of 
events, 
and 
necessity 
itself, 
if 
there 
were 
any 
in 
the 
way 
our 
actions 
depend 
upon 
causes, 
would 
not 
prevent 
us 
from 
employing 
deliberations, 
exhortations, 
blame 
and 
praise, 
punishments 
and 
rewards: 
for 
these 
are 
of 
service 
and 
prompt 
men 
to 
produce 
actions 
or 
to 
refrain 
from 
them. 
Thus, 
if 
human 
actions 
were 
necessary, 
they 
would 
be 
so 
through 
these 
means. 
But 
the 
truth 
is, 
that 
since 
these 
actions 
are 
not 
necessary 
absolutely 
whatever 
one 
may 
do, 
these 
means 
contribute 
only 
to 
render 
the 
actions 
determinate 
and 
certain, 
as 
they 
are 
indeed; 
for 
their 
nature 
shows 
that 
they 
are 
not 
subject 
to 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
He 
gives 
also 
a 
good 
enough 
notion 
of 
freedom, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
taken 
in 
a 
general 
sense, 
common 

to 
intelligent 
and 
non-intelligent 
substances: 
he 
states 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
deemed 
free 
when 
the 
power 
which 
it 
has 
is 
not 
impeded 
by 
an 
external 
thing. 
Thus 
the 
water 
that 
is 
dammed 
by 
a 
dyke 
has 
the 
power 
to 
spread, 
but 
not 
the 
freedom. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
has 
not 
the 
power 
to 
rise 
above 
the 
dyke, 
although 
nothing 
would 
prevent 
it 
then 
from 
spreading, 
and 
although 
nothing 
from 
outside 
prevents 
it 
from 
rising 
so 
high. 
To 
that 
end 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
the 
water 
itself 
should 
come 
from 
a 
higher 
point 
or 
that 
the 
water-level 
should 
be 
raised 
by 
an 
increased 
flow. 
Thus 
a 
prisoner 
lacks 
the 
freedom,while 
asickmanlacksthepower,togo 
his 
way. 


5. 
There 
is 
in 
Mr. 
Hobbes’s 
preface 
an 
abstract 
of 
the 
disputed 
points, 
which 
I 
will 
give 
here, 
adding 
some 
expression 
of 
opinion. 
On 
one 
side 
(he 
says) 
the 
assertion 
is 
made, 
(1) 
‘that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
the 
present 
power 
of 
man 
to 
choose 
for 
himself 
the 
will 
that 
he 
should 
have’. 
That 
is 
well 
said, 
especially 
in 
relation 
to 
present 
will: 
men 
choose 
the 
objects 
through 
will, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
choose 
their 
present 
wills, 
which 
spring 
from 
reasons 
and 
dispositions. 
It 
is 
true, 
however, 
that 
one 
can 
seek 
new 
reasons 
for 
oneself, 
and 
with 
time 
give 
oneself 
new 
dispositions; 
and 
by 
this 
means 
one 
can 
also 
obtain 
for 
oneself 
a 
will 
which 
one 
had 
not 
and 
could 
not 
have 
given 
oneself 
forthwith. 
It 
is 
(to 
use 
the 
comparison 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
himself 
uses) 
as 
with 
hunger 
or 
with 
thirst. 
At 
the 
present 
it 
does 
not 
rest 
with 
my 
will 
to 
be 
hungry 
or 
not; 
but 
it 
rests 
with 
my 
will 
to 
eat 
or 
not 
to 
eat; 
yet, 
for 
the 
time 
to 
come, 
it 
rests 
with 
me 
to 
be 
hungry, 
or 
to 
prevent 
myself 
from 
being 
so 
at 
such 
and 
such 
an 
hour 
of 
day, 
by 
eating 
beforehand. 
In 
this 
way 
it 
is 
possible 
often 
to 
avoid 
an 
evil 
will. 
Even 
though 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
states 
in 
his 
reply 
(No. 
14, 
) 
that 
it 
is 
the 
manner 
of 
laws 
to 
say, 
you 
must 
do 
or 
you 
must 
not 
do 
this, 
but 
that 
there 
is 
no 
law 
saying, 
you 
must 
will, 
or 
you 
must 
not 
will 
it, 
yet 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
he 
is 
mistakenin 
regardto 
theLaw 
ofGod, 
whichsays 
non 
concupisces,thoushalt 
not 
covet; 
it 
is 
true 
that 
this 
prohibition 
does 
not 
concern 
the 
first 
motions, 

which 
are 
involuntary. 
It 
is 
asserted 
(2) 
‘That 
hazard’ 
(chance 
in 
English, 
casus 
in 
Latin) 
‘produces 
nothing’, 
that 
is, 
that 
nothing 
is 
produced 
without 
cause 
or 
reason. 
Very 
right, 
I 
admit 
it, 
if 
one 
thereby 
intends 
a 
real 
hazard. 
For 
fortune 
and 
hazard 
are 
only 
appearances, 
which 
spring 
from 
ignorance 
of 
causes 
or 
from 
disregard 
of 
them. 
(3) 
‘That 
all 
events 
have 
their 
necessary 
causes.’ 
Wrong: 
they 
have 
their 
determining 
causes, 
whereby 
one 
can 
account 
for 
them; 
but 
these 
are 
not 
necessary 
causes. 
The 
contrary 
might 
have 
happened, 
without 
implying 
contradiction. 
(4) 
‘That 
the 
will 
of 
God 
makes 
the 
necessity 
of 
all 
things.’ 
Wrong: 
the 
will 
of 
God 
produces 
only 
contingent 
things, 
which 
could 
have 
gone 
differently, 
since 
time, 
space 
and 
matterareindifferent 
withregardto 
allkindsofshapeand 
movement. 


6. 
On 
the 
other 
side 
(according 
to 
Mr. 
Hobbes) 
it 
is 
asserted, 
(1) 
‘That 
man 
is 
free’ 
(absolutely) 
not 
only 
‘to 
choose 
what 
he 
wills 
to 
do, 
but 
also 
to 
choose 
what 
he 
wills 
to 
will.’ 
That 
is 
ill 
said: 
one 
is 
not 
absolute 
master 
of 
one’s 
will, 
to 
change 
it 
forthwith, 
without 
making 
use 
of 
some 
means 
or 
skill 
for 
that 
purpose. 
(2) 
‘When 
man 
wills 
a 
good 
action, 
the 
will 
of 
God 
cooperates 
with 
his, 
otherwise 
not.’ 
That 
is 
well 
said, 
provided 
one 
means 
that 
God 
does 
not 
will 
evil 
actions, 
although 
he 
wills 
to 
permit 
them, 
to 
prevent 
the 
occurrence 
of 
something 
which 
would 
be 
worse 
than 
these 
sins. 
(3) 
‘That 
the 
will 
can 
choose 
whether 
it 
wills 
to 
will 
or 
not.’ 
Wrong, 
with 
regard 
to 
present 
volition. 
(4) 
‘That 
things 
happen 
without 
necessity 
by 
chance.’ 
Wrong: 
what 
happens 
without 
necessity 
does 
not 
because 
of 
that 
happen 
by 
chance, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
without 
causes 
and 
reasons. 
(5) 
‘Notwithstanding 
that 
God 
may 
foresee 
that 
an 
event 
will 
happen, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
it 
happen, 
since 
God 
foresees 
things, 
not 
as 
futurities 
and 
as 
in 
their 
causes, 
but 
as 
present.’ 
That 
begins 
well, 
and 
finishes 
ill. 
One 
is 
justified 
in 
admitting 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
consequence, 
but 
one 
has 
no 
reason 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
question 

how 
the 
future 
is 
present 
to 
God: 
for 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
consequence

7. 
Our 
author 
thinks 
that 
since 
the 
doctrine 
revived 
by 
Arminius 
had 
been 
favoured 
in 
England 
by 
Archbishop 
Laud 
and 
by 
the 
Court, 
and 
important 
ecclesiastical 
promotions 
had 
been 
only 
for 
those 
of 
that 
party, 
this 
contributed 
to 
the 
revolt 
which 
caused 
the 
bishop 
and 
him 
to 
meet 
in 
their 
exile 
in 
Paris 
at 
the 
house 
of 
Lord 
Newcastle, 
and 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
discussion. 
I 
would 
not 
approve 
all 
the 
measures 
of 
Archbishop 
Laud, 
who 
had 
merit 
and 
perhaps 
also 
good 
will, 
but 
who 
appears 
to 
have 
goaded 
the 
Presbyterians 
excessively. 
Nevertheless 
one 
may 
say 
that 
the 
revolutions, 
as 
much 
in 
the 
Low 
Countries 
as 
in 
Great 
Britain, 
in 
part 
arose 
from 
the 
extreme 
intolerance 
of 
the 
strict 
party. 
One 
may 
say 
also 
that 
the 
defenders 
of 
the 
absolute 
decree 
were 
at 
least 
as 
strict 
as 
the 
others, 
having 
oppressed 
their 
opponents 
in 
Hollandwiththeauthorityof 
PrinceMaurice 
andhaving 
fomentedtherevolts 
in 
England 
against 
King 
Charles 
I. 
But 
these 
are 
the 
faults 
of 
men, 
and 
not 
of 
dogmas. 
Their 
opponents 
do 
not 
spare 
them 
either, 
witness 
the 
severity 
used 
in 
Saxony 
against 
Nicolas 
Krell 
and 
the 
proceedings 
of 
the 
Jesuits 
against 
the 
Bishopof 
Ypres’s 
party. 
8. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
observes, 
after 
Aristotle, 
that 
there 
are 
two 
sources 
for 
proofs: 
reason 
and 
authority. 
Asfor 
reason, 
he 
says 
that 
headmitsthe 
reasons 
derived 
from 
the 
attributes 
of 
God, 
which 
he 
calls 
argumentative, 
and 
the 
notions 
whereof 
are 
conceivable; 
but 
he 
maintains 
that 
there 
are 
others 
wherein 
one 
conceives 
nothing, 
and 
which 
are 
only 
expressions 
by 
which 
we 
aspire 
to 
honour 
God. 
But 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
one 
can 
honour 
God 
by 
expressions 
that 
have 
no 
meaning. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
with 
Mr. 
Hobbes, 
as 
with 
Spinoza, 
wisdom, 
goodness, 
justice 
are 
only 
fictions 
in 
relation 
to 
God 
and 
the 
universe, 
since 
the 
prime 
cause, 
according 
to 
them, 
acts 
through 
the 
necessity 
of 
its 
power, 
and 
not 
by 
the 
choice 
of 
its 
wisdom. 
That 
is 
an 

opinion 
whose 
falsity 
I 
have 
sufficiently 
proved. 
It 
appears 
that 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
declare 
himself 
enough, 
for 
fear 
of 
causing 
offence 
to 
people; 
on 
which 
point 
he 
is 
to 
be 
commended. 
It 
was 
also 
on 
that 
account, 
as 
he 
says 
himself, 
that 
he 
had 
desired 
that 
what 
had 
passed 
between 
the 
bishop 
and 
him 
in 
Paris 
should 
not 
be 
published. 
He 
adds 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good 
to 
say 
that 
an 
action 
which 
God 
does 
not 
will 
happens,since 
that 
is 
tosay 
in 
effect 
that 
God 
is 
lacking 
in 
power. 
But 
he 
adds 
also 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
it 
is 
not 
good 
either 
to 
say 
the 
opposite, 
and 
to 
attribute 
to 
God 
that 
he 
wills 
the 
evil; 
because 
that 
is 
not 
seemly, 
and 
would 
appear 
to 
accuse 
God 
of 
lack 
of 
goodness. 
He 
believes, 
therefore, 
that 
in 
these 
matters 
telling 
the 
truth 
is 
not 
advisable. 
He 
would 
be 
right 
if 
the 
truth 
were 
in 
the 
paradoxical 
opinions 
that 
he 
maintains. 
For 
indeedit 
appears 
that 
accordingtothe 
opinion 
of 
thiswriter 
God 
has 
no 
goodness, 
or 
rather 
that 
that 
which 
he 
calls 
God 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
blind 
nature 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
material 
things, 
which 
acts 
according 
to 
mathematical 
laws, 
following 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
as 
the 
atoms 
do 
in 
the 
system 
of 
Epicurus. 
If 
God 
were 
as 
the 
great 
are 
sometimes 
here 
on 
earth, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
fitting 
to 
utter 
all 
the 
truths 
concerning 
him. 
But 
God 
is 
not 
as 
a 
man, 
whose 
designs 
and 
actions 
often 
must 
be 
concealed; 
rather 
it 
is 
always 
permissible 
and 
reasonable 
to 
publish 
the 
counsels 
and 
the 
actions 
of 
God, 
because 
they 
are 
always 
glorious 
and 
worthy 
of 
praise. 
Thus 
it 
is 
always 
right 
to 
utter 
truths 
concerning 
the 
divinity; 
one 
need 
not 
anyhow 
refrain 
from 
fear 
of 
giving 
offence. 
And 
I 
have 
explained, 
so 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
in 
a 
way 
which 
satisfies 
reason, 
and 
does 
not 
wound 
piety, 
how 
it 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
that 
God’s 
will 
takes 
effect, 
and 
concurs 
with 
sin, 
without 
compromising 
his 
wisdomand 
his 
goodness. 


9. 
As 
to 
the 
authorities 
derived 
from 
Holy 
Scripture, 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
divides 
them 
into 
three 
kinds; 
some, 
he 
says, 
are 
for 
me, 
the 
second 
kind 
are 
neutral, 
and 
the 
third 
seem 
to 
be 
for 
my 
opponent. 
The 
passages 
which 
he 
thinks 

favourable 
to 
his 
opinion 
are 
those 
which 
ascribe 
to 
God 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
will. 
Thus 
Gen. 
xlv. 
5, 
where 
Joseph 
says 
to 
his 
brethren, 
‘Be 
not 
grieved, 
nor 
angry 
with 
yourselves, 
that 
you 
sold 
me 
hither: 
for 
God 
did 
send 
me 
before 
you 
to 
preserve 
life’; 
and 
verse 
8, 
‘it 
was 
not 
you 
that 
sent 
me 
hither, 
but 
God.’ 
And 
God 
said 
(Exod. 
vii. 
3), 
‘I 
will 
harden 
Pharaoh’s 
heart.’ 
And 
Moses 
said 
(Deut. 
ii. 
30), 
‘But 
Sihon 
King 
of 
Heshbon 
would 
not 
let 
us 
pass 
by 
him: 
for 
the 
Lord 
thy 
God 
hardened 
his 
spirit, 
and 
made 
his 
heart 
obstinate, 
that 
he 
might 
deliver 
him 
into 
thy 
hand.’ 
And 
David 
said 
of 
Shimei 
(2 
Sam. 
xvi. 
10), 
‘Let 
him 
curse, 
because 
the 
Lord 
hath 
said 
unto 
him: 
Curse 
David. 
Who 
shall 
then 
say, 
wherefore 
hast 
thou 
done 
so?’ 
And 
(1 
Kings 
xii. 
15), 
‘The 
King 
[Rehoboam] 
hearkened 
not 
unto 
the 
people; 
for 
the 
cause 
was 
from 
the 
Lord.’ 
Job 
xii. 
16: 
‘The 
deceived 
and 
the 
deceiver 
are 
his.’ 
v. 
17: 
‘He 
maketh 
the 
judges 
fools’; 
v. 
24: 
‘He 
taketh 
away 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
chief 
of 
the 
people 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
causeth 
them 
to 
wander 
in 
a 
wilderness’; 
v. 
25: 
‘He 
maketh 
them 
to 
stagger 
like 
a 
drunken 
man.’ 
God 
said 
of 
the 
King 
of 
Assyria 
(Isa. 
x. 
6), 
‘Against 
the 
people 
will 
I 
give 
him 
a 
charge, 
to 
take 
the 
spoil, 
and 
to 
take 
the 
prey, 
and 
to 
tread 
them 
down 
like 
the 
mire 
of 
the 
streets.’ 
And 
Jeremiah 
said 
(Jer. 
x. 
23), 
‘O 
Lord, 
I 
know 
that 
the 
way 
of 
man 
is 
not 
in 
himself: 
it 
is 
not 
in 
man 
that 
walketh 
to 
direct 
his 
steps.’ 
And 
God 
said 
(Ezek. 
iii. 
20), 
‘When 
a 
righteous 
man 
doth 
turn 
from 
his 
righteousness, 
and 
commit 
iniquity, 
and 
I 
lay 
a 
stumbling-block 
before 
him, 
he 
shall 
die.’ 
And 
the 
Saviour 
said 
(John 
vi. 
44), 
‘No 
man 
can 
come 
to 
me, 
except 
the 
Father 
which 
hath 
sent 
me 
draw 
him.’ 
And 
St. 
Peter 
(Acts 
ii. 
23), 
‘Jesus 
having 
been 
delivered 
by 
the 
determinate 
counsel 
and 
foreknowledge 
of 
God, 
ye 
have 
taken.’ 
And 
Acts 
iv. 
27, 
28, 
‘Both 
Herod 
and 
Pontius 
Pilate, 
with 
the 
Gentiles 
and 
the 
people 
of 
Israel, 
were 
gathered 
together, 
for 
to 
do 
whatsoever 
thy 
hand 
and 
thy 
counsel 
determined 
before 
to 
be 
done.’ 
And 
St. 
Paul 
(Rom. 
ix. 
16), 
‘It 
is 
not 
of 
him 
that 
willeth, 
nor 
of 
him 
that 
runneth, 
but 



of 
God 
that 
showeth 
mercy.’ 
And 
v. 
18: 
‘Therefore 
hath 
he 
mercy 
on 
whom 
he 
will 
have 
mercy, 
and 
whom 
he 
will 
he 
hardeneth’; 
v. 
19: 
‘Thou 
wilt 
say 
then 
unto 
me, 
why 
doth 
he 
yet 
find 
fault? 
For 
who 
hath 
resisted 
his 
will?’; 
v. 


20: 
‘Nay 
but, 
O 
man, 
who 
art 
thou 
that 
repliest 
against 
God? 
Shall 
the 
thing 
formed 
say 
to 
him 
that 
formed 
it, 
why 
hast 
thou 
made 
me 
thus?’ 
And 
1 
Cor. 
iv. 
7: 
‘For 
who 
maketh 
thee 
to 
differ 
from 
another? 
and 
what 
hast 
thou 
that 
thou 
didst 
not 
receive?’ 
And 
1 
Cor. 
xii. 
6: 
‘There 
are 
diversities 
of 
operations, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
same 
God 
which 
worketh 
all 
in 
all.’ 
And 
Eph. 
ii. 
10: 
‘We 
are 
his 
workmanship, 
created 
in 
Christ 
Jesus 
unto 
good 
works, 
which 
God 
hath 
beforeordainedthatwe 
should 
walk 
in 
them.’ 
AndPhil. 
ii. 
13: 
‘It 
is 
God 
which 
worketh 
in 
you 
both 
to 
will 
and 
to 
do 
of 
his 
good 
pleasure.’ 
One 
may 
add 
to 
these 
passages 
all 
those 
which 
make 
God 
the 
author 
of 
all 
grace 
and 
of 
all 
good 
inclinations, 
and 
all 
those 
which 
say 
that 
we 
are 
as 
dead 
in 
sin. 
10. 
Here 
nowarethe 
neutralpassages, 
according 
toMr. 
Hobbes. 
Theseare 
those 
where 
Holy 
Scripture 
says 
that 
man 
has 
the 
choice 
to 
act 
if 
he 
wills, 
or 
not 
to 
act 
if 
he 
wills 
not. 
For 
example 
Deut. 
xxx. 
19: 
‘I 
call 
heaven 
and 
earth 
to 
record 
this 
day 
against 
you, 
that 
I 
have 
set 
before 
you 
life 
and 
death, 
blessing 
and 
cursing: 
therefore 
choose 
life, 
that 
both 
thou 
and 
thy 
seed 
may 
live.’ 
And 
Joshua 
xxiv. 
15: 
‘Choose 
you 
this 
day 
whom 
ye 
will 
serve.’ 
And 
God 
said 
to 
Gad 
the 
prophet 
(2 
Sam. 
xxiv. 
12), 
‘Go 
and 
say 
unto 
David: 
Thus 
saith 
the 
Lord, 
I 
offer 
thee 
three 
things; 
choose 
thee 
one 
of 
them, 
that 
I 
may 
do 
it 
unto 
thee.’ 
And 
Isa. 
vii. 
16: 
‘Until 
the 
child 
shall 
know 
to 
refuse 
the 
evil 
and 
choose 
the 
good.’ 
Finally 
the 
passages 
which 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
acknowledges 
to 
be 
apparently 
contrary 
to 
his 
opinion 
are 
all 
those 
where 
it 
is 
indicated 
that 
the 
will 
of 
man 
is 
not 
in 
conformity 
with 
that 
of 
God. 
Thus 
Isa. 
v. 
4: 
‘What 
could 
have 
been 
done 
more 
to 
my 
vineyard, 
that 
I 
have 
not 
done 
in 
it? 
Wherefore, 
when 
I 
looked 
that 
it 
should 
bring 
forth 
grapes, 
brought 
it 
forth 

wild 
grapes?’ 
And 
Jer. 
xix. 
5: 
‘They 
have 
built 
also 
the 
high 
places 
of 
Baal, 
to 
burn 
their 
sons 
with 
fire 
for 
burnt 
offerings 
unto 
Baal; 
which 
I 
commanded 
not, 
nor 
spake 
it, 
neither 
came 
it 
into 
my 
mind.’ 
And 
Hos. 
xiii. 
9: 
‘O 
Israel, 
thou 
hast 
destroyed 
thyself; 
but 
in 
me 
is 
thine 
help.’ 
And 
I 
Tim. 
ii. 
4: 
‘God 
will 
have 
all 
men 
to 
be 
saved, 
and 
to 
come 
unto 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth.’ 
He 
avows 
that 
he 
could 
quote 
very 
many 
other 
passages, 
such 
as 
those 
which 
indicate 
that 
God 
willeth 
not 
iniquity, 
that 
he 
willeth 
the 
salvation 
of 
the 
sinner, 
and 
generally 
all 
those 
which 
declare 
that 
God 
commands 
good 
and 
forbidsevil. 


11. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
makes 
answer 
to 
these 
passages 
that 
God 
does 
not 
always 
will 
that 
which 
he 
commands, 
as 
for 
example 
when 
he 
commanded 
Abraham 
to 
sacrifice 
his 
son, 
and 
that 
God’s 
revealed 
will 
is 
not 
always 
his 
full 
will 
or 
his 
decree, 
as 
when 
he 
revealed 
to 
Jonah 
that 
Nineveh 
would 
perish 
in 
forty 
days. 
He 
adds 
also, 
that 
when 
it 
is 
said 
that 
God 
wills 
the 
salvation 
of 
all, 
that 
means 
simply 
that 
God 
commands 
that 
all 
do 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
for 
salvation; 
when, 
moreover, 
the 
Scripture 
says 
that 
God 
wills 
not 
sin, 
that 
means 
that 
he 
wills 
to 
punish 
it. 
And 
as 
for 
the 
rest, 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
ascribes 
it 
to 
the 
forms 
of 
expression 
used 
among 
men. 
But 
one 
will 
answer 
him 
that 
it 
would 
be 
to 
God’s 
discredit 
that 
his 
revealed 
will 
should 
be 
opposed 
to 
his 
realwill: 
thatwhathe 
bade 
Jonah 
saytothe 
Nineviteswasrathera 
threatthan 
a 
prediction, 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
condition 
of 
impenitence 
was 
implied 
therein; 
moreover 
the 
Ninevites 
took 
it 
in 
this 
sense. 
One 
will 
say 
also, 
that 
it 
is 
quite 
true 
that 
God 
in 
commanding 
Abraham 
to 
sacrifice 
his 
son 
willed 
obedience, 
but 
did 
not 
will 
action, 
which 
he 
prevented 
after 
having 
obtained 
obedience; 
for 
that 
was 
not 
an 
action 
deserving 
in 
itself 
to 
be 
willed. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
in 
the 
case 
of 
actions 
where 
he 
exerts 
his 
will 
positively, 
and 
which 
are 
in 
fact 
worthy 
to 
be 
the 
object 
of 
his 
will. 
Of 
such 
are 
piety, 
charity 
and 
every 
virtuous 
action 
that 
God 
commands; 
of 
such 
is 
omission 
of 
sin, 
a 
thing 
more 

alientodivineperfection 
thananyother. 
It 
isthereforeincomparablybetterto 
explain 
the 
will 
of 
God 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
it 
in 
this 
work. 
Thus 
I 
shall 
say 
that 
God, 
by 
virtue 
of 
his 
supreme 
goodness, 
has 
in 
the 
beginning 
a 
serious 
inclination 
to 
produce, 
or 
to 
see 
and 
cause 
to 
be 
produced, 
all 
good 
and 
every 
laudable 
action, 
and 
to 
prevent, 
or 
to 
see 
and 
cause 
to 
fail, 
all 
evil 
and 
every 
bad 
action. 
But 
he 
is 
determined 
by 
this 
same 
goodness, 
united 
to 
an 
infinite 
wisdom, 
and 
by 
the 
very 
concourse 
of 
all 
the 
previous 
and 
particular 
inclinations 
towards 
each 
good, 
and 
towards 
the 
preventing 
of 
each 
evil, 
to 
producethe 
bestpossibledesign 
ofthings. 
Thisis 
hisfinaland 
decretory 
will. 
And 
this 
design 
of 
the 
best 
being 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
the 
good 
must 
be 
enhanced 
therein, 
as 
light 
is 
enhanced 
by 
shade, 
by 
some 
evil 
which 
is 
incomparably 
less 
than 
this 
good, 
God 
could 
not 
have 
excluded 
this 
evil, 
nor 
introduced 
certain 
goods 
thatwereexcluded 
from 
thisplan,withoutwronging 
his 
supreme 
perfection. 
So 
for 
that 
reason 
one 
must 
say 
that 
he 
permitted 
the 
sins 
of 
others, 
because 
otherwise 
he 
would 
have 
himself 
performed 
an 
action 
worse 
thanallthesinofcreatures.

IfindthattheBishop 
ofDerry 
isat 
leastjustifiedinsaying, 
articleXV, 
in 
hisReply,, 
that 
theopinion 
of 
his 
opponents 
is 
contrary 
topiety, 
when 
they 
ascribe 
all 
to 
God’s 
power 
only, 
and 
that 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
said 
that 
honour 
or 
worship 
is 
only 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
power 
of 
him 
whom 
one 
honours: 
for 
one 
may 
also, 
and 
one 
must, 
acknowledge 
and 
honour 
wisdom, 
goodness, 
justice 
and 
other 
perfections. 
Magnos 
facile 
laudamus, 
bonos 
libenter. 
This 
opinion, 
which 
despoils 
God 
of 
all 
goodness 
and 
of 
all 
true 
justice, 
which 
represents 
him 
as 
a 
Tyrant, 
wielding 
an 
absolute 
power, 
independent 
of 
all 
right 
and 
of 
all 
equity, 
and 
creating 
millions 
of 
creatures 
to 
be 
eternally 
unhappy, 
and 
this 
without 
any 
other 
aim 
than 
that 
of 
displaying 
his 
power, 
this 
opinion, 
I 
say, 
is 
capable 
of 
rendering 
men 
very 
evil; 
and 
if 
it 
were 
accepted 
no 
other 
Devil 
would 
be 
needed 
in 
the 
world 
to 
set 
men 
at 
variance 

among 
themselves 
and 
with 
God; 
as 
the 
Serpent 
did 
in 
making 
Eve 
believe 
that 
God, 
when 
he 
forbade 
her 
the 
fruit 
of 
the 
tree, 
did 
not 
will 
her 
good. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
endeavours 
to 
parry 
this 
thrust 
in 
his 
Rejoinder 
() 
by 
saying 
that 
goodness 
is 
a 
part 
of 
the 
power 
of 
God, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
power 
of 
making 
himself 
worthy 
of 
love. 
But 
that 
is 
an 
abuse 
of 
terms 
by 
an 
evasion, 
and 
confounds 
things 
that 
must 
be 
kept 
distinct. 
After 
all, 
if 
God 
does 
not 
intend 
the 
good 
of 
intelligent 
creatures, 
if 
he 
has 
no 
other 
principles 
of 
justice 
than 
his 
power 
alone, 
which 
makes 
him 
produce 
either 
arbitrarily 
that 
which 
chance 
presents 
to 
him, 
or 
by 
necessity 
all 
that 
which 
is 
possible, 
without 
the 
intervention 
of 
choice 
founded 
on 
good, 
how 
can 
he 
make 
himself 
worthy 
of 
love? 
It 
is 
therefore 
the 
doctrine 
either 
of 
blind 
power 
or 
of 
arbitrary 
power, 
which 
destroys 
piety: 
for 
the 
one 
destroys 
the 
intelligent 
principle 
or 
the 
providence 
of 
God, 
the 
other 
attributes 
to 
him 
actions 
which 
are 
appropriate 
to 
the 
evil 
principle. 
Justice 
in 
God, 
says 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
(), 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
power 
he 
has, 
which 
he 
exercises 
in 
distributing 
blessings 
and 
afflictions. 
This 
definition 
surprises 
me: 
it 
is 
not 
the 
power 
to 
distribute 
them, 
but 
the 
willtodistributethemreasonably,thatis,goodness 
guidedbywisdom, 
which 
makes 
the 
justice 
of 
God. 
But, 
says 
he, 
justice 
is 
not 
in 
God 
as 
in 
a 
man, 
who 
is 
only 
just 
through 
the 
observance 
of 
laws 
made 
by 
his 
superior. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
is 
mistaken 
also 
in 
that, 
as 
well 
as 
Herr 
Pufendorf, 
who 
followed 
him. 
Justice 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
arbitrary 
laws 
of 
superiors, 
but 
on 
the 
eternal 
rules 
of 
wisdom 
and 
of 
goodness, 
in 
men 
as 
well 
as 
in 
God. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
asserts 
in 
the 
same 
passage 
that 
the 
wisdom 
which 
is 
attributed 
to 
God 
does 
not 
lie 
in 
a 
logical 
consideration 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
means 
to 
ends, 
but 
in 
an 
incomprehensible 
attribute, 
attributed 
to 
an 
incomprehensible 
nature 
to 
honour 
it. 
It 
seems 
as 
if 
he 
means 
that 
it 
is 
an 
indescribable 
something 
attributed 
to 
an 
indescribable 
something, 
and 
even 
a 
chimerical 
quality 
given 
to 
a 
chimerical 
substance, 
to 
intimidate 
andto 
deceive 
the 
nations 
through 
the 



worship 
which 
they 
render 
to 
it. 
After 
all, 
it 
is 
difficult 
for 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
to 
have 
a 
different 
opinion 
of 
God 
and 
of 
wisdom, 
since 
he 
admits 
only 
material 
substances. 
If 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
were 
still 
alive, 
I 
would 
beware 
of 
ascribing 
to 
him 
opinions 
which 
might 
do 
him 
injury; 
but 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
exempt 
him 
from 
this. 
He 
may 
have 
changed 
his 
mind 
subsequently, 
for 
he 
attained 
to 
a 
great 
age; 
thus 
I 
hope 
that 
his 
errors 
may 
not 
have 
been 
deleterious 
to 
him. 
But 
as 
they 
might 
be 
so 
to 
others, 
it 
is 
expedient 
to 
give 
warnings 
to 
those 
who 
shall 
read 
the 
writings 
of 
one 
who 
otherwise 
is 
of 
great 
merit, 
and 
from 
whom 
one 
may 
profit 
in 
many 
ways. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
God 
does 
not 
reason, 
properly 
speaking, 
using 
time 
as 
we 
do, 
to 
pass 
from 
one 
truth 
to 
the 
other: 
but 
as 
he 
understands 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
all 
the 
truths 
and 
all 
their 
connexions, 
he 
knows 
all 
the 
conclusions, 
and 
he 
contains 
in 
the 
highest 
degree 
within 
himself 
all 
the 
reasonings 
that 
we 
can 
develop. 
And 
just 
becauseofthat 
his 
wisdom 
isperfect. 



OBSERVATIONSON 
THE 
BOOK 
CONCERNING 
‘THE 
ORIGIN 
OF 
EVIL’ 
PUBLISHED 
RECENTLY 
IN 
LONDON 



1. 
IT 
IS 
a 
pity 
that 
M. 
Bayle 
should 
have 
seen 
only 
the 
reviews 
of 
this 
admirable 
work, 
which 
are 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
journals. 
If 
he 
had 
read 
it 
himself 
and 
examined 
it 
properly, 
he 
would 
have 
provided 
us 
with 
a 
good 
opportunity 
of 
throwing 
light 
on 
many 
difficulties, 
which 
spring 
again 
and 
again 
like 
the 
head 
of 
the 
hydra, 
in 
a 
matter 
where 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
become 
confused 
when 
one 
has 
not 
seen 
the 
whole 
system 
or 
does 
not 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
reason 
according 
to 
a 
strict 
plan. 
For 
strictness 
of 
reasoning 
performs 
in 
subjects 
that 
transcend 
imagination 
the 
same 
function 
as 
figures 
do 
in 
geometry: 
there 
must 
always 
be 
something 
capable 
of 
fixing 
our 
attention 
and 
forming 
a 
connexion 
between 
our 
thoughts. 
That 
is 
why 
when 
this 
Latin 
book, 
so 
learned 
and 
so 
elegant 
of 
style, 
printed 
originally 
in 
London 
and 
then 
reprinted 
in 
Bremen, 
fell 
into 
my 
hands, 
I 
judged 
that 
the 
seriousness 
of 
the 
matter 
and 
the 
author’s 
merit 
required 
an 
attention 
which 
readers 
might 
fairly 
expect 
of 
me, 
since 
we 
are 
agreed 
only 
in 
regard 
to 
half 
of 
the 
subject. 
Indeed, 
as 
the 
work 
contains 
five 
chapters, 
and 
the 
fifth 
with 
the 
appendix 
equals 
the 
rest 
in 
size, 
I 
have 
observed 
that 
the 
first 
four, 
where 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
evil 
in 
general 
and 
of 
physical 
evil 
in 
particular, 
are 
in 
harmony 
with 
my 
principles 
(save 
for 
a 
few 
individual 
passages), 
and 
that 
they 
sometimes 
even 
develop 
with 
force 
and 
eloquence 
some 
points 
I 
had 
treated 
but 
slightly 
because 
M. 
Bayle 
had 
not 
placed 
emphasis 
upon 
them. 
But 
the 
fifth 
chapter, 
with 
its 
sections 
(of 
which 
some 
are 
equal 
to 
entire 
chapters) 
speaking 
of 
freedom 
and 
of 
the 
moral 
evil 
dependent 
upon 
it, 
is 
constructed 
upon 
principles 
opposed 
to 
mine, 
and 
often, 
indeed, 
to 
those 
of 
M. 
Bayle; 
that 
is, 
if 
it 
were 
possible 
to 
credit 
him 
with 
any 
fixed 
principles. 

For 
this 
fifth 
chapter 
tends 
to 
show 
(if 
that 
were 
possible) 
that 
true 
freedom 
depends 
upon 
an 
indifference 
of 
equipoise, 
vague, 
complete 
and 
absolute; 
so 
that, 
until 
the 
will 
has 
determined 
itself, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
reason 
for 
its 
determination, 
either 
in 
him 
who 
chooses 
or 
in 
the 
object; 
and 
one 
would 
not 
choose 
what 
pleases, 
but 
in 
choosing 
without 
reason 
one 
would 
cause 
what 
one 
chooses 
tobepleasing. 


2. 
This 
principle 
of 
choice 
without 
cause 
or 
reason, 
of 
a 
choice, 
I 
say, 
divested 
of 
the 
aim 
of 
wisdom 
and 
goodness, 
is 
regarded 
by 
many 
as 
the 
great 
privilege 
of 
God 
and 
of 
intelligent 
substances, 
and 
as 
the 
source 
of 
their 
freedom, 
their 
satisfaction, 
their 
morality 
and 
their 
good 
or 
evil. 
The 
fantasy 
of 
a 
power 
to 
declare 
one’s 
independence, 
not 
only 
of 
inclination, 
but 
of 
reason 
itself 
within 
and 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
without, 
is 
sometimes 
painted 
in 
such 
fine 
colours 
that 
one 
might 
take 
it 
to 
be 
the 
most 
excellent 
thing 
in 
the 
world. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
only 
a 
hollow 
fantasy, 
a 
suppression 
of 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
caprice 
of 
which 
one 
boasts. 
What 
is 
asserted 
is 
impossible, 
but 
if 
it 
came 
to 
pass 
it 
would 
be 
harmful. 
This 
fantastic 
character 
might 
be 
attributed 
to 
some 
Don 
Juan 
in 
a 
St. 
Peter’s 
Feast, 
and 
a 
man 
of 
romantic 
disposition 
might 
even 
affect 
the 
outward 
appearances 
of 
it 
and 
persuade 
himself 
that 
he 
has 
it 
in 
reality. 
But 
in 
Nature 
there 
will 
never 
be 
any 
choice 
to 
which 
one 
is 
not 
prompted 
by 
the 
previous 
representation 
of 
good 
or 
evil, 
by 
inclinations 
or 
by 
reasons: 
and 
I 
have 
always 
challenged 
the 
supporters 
of 
this 
absolute 
indifference 
to 
show 
an 
example 
thereof. 
Nevertheless 
if 
I 
call 
fantastic 
this 
choice 
whereto 
one 
is 
determined 
by 
nothing, 
I 
am 
far 
from 
calling 
visionaries 
the 
supporters 
of 
that 
hypothesis, 
especially 
our 
gifted 
author. 
The 
Peripatetics 
teach 
some 
beliefs 
of 
this 
nature; 
but 
it 
would 
be 
the 
greatest 
injustice 
in 
the 
world 
to 
be 
ready 
to 
despise 
on 
that 
account 
an 
Occam, 
a 
Suisset, 
a 
Cesalpino, 
a 
Conringius, 
men 
who 
still 
advocated 
certain 
scholastic 
opinions 
whichhave 
been 
improveduponto-day. 

3. 
One 
of 
these 
opinions, 
revived, 
however, 
and 
introduced 
by 
degenerate 
scholasticism, 
and 
in 
the 
Age 
of 
Chimeras, 
is 
vague 
indifference 
of 
choice, 
or 
real 
chance, 
assumed 
in 
our 
souls;as 
ifnothing 
gave 
usany 
inclination 
unless 
we 
perceived 
it 
distinctly, 
and 
as 
if 
an 
effect 
could 
be 
without 
causes, 
when 
these 
causes 
are 
imperceptible. 
It 
is 
much 
as 
some 
have 
denied 
the 
existence 
of 
insensible 
corpuscles 
because 
they 
do 
not 
see 
them. 
Modern 
philosophers 
have 
improved 
upon 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
Schoolmen 
by 
showing 
that, 
accordingto 
thelaws 
of 
corporealnature,a 
bodycanonly 
be 
setin 
motion 
by 
the 
movement 
of 
another 
body 
propelling 
it. 
Even 
so 
we 
must 
believe 
that 
our 
souls 
(by 
virtue 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
spiritual 
nature) 
can 
only 
be 
moved 
by 
some 
reason 
of 
good 
or 
evil: 
and 
this 
even 
when 
no 
distinct 
knowledge 
can 
be 
extracted 
from 
our 
mental 
state, 
on 
account 
of 
a 
concourse 
of 
innumerable 
little 
perceptions 
which 
make 
us 
now 
joyful 
and 
now 
sad, 
or 
again 
of 
some 
other 
humour, 
and 
cause 
us 
to 
like 
one 
thing 
more 
than 
another 
without 
its 
being 
possible 
to 
say 
why. 
Plato, 
Aristotle 
and 
even 
Thomas 
Aquinas, 
Durand 
and 
other 
Schoolmen 
of 
the 
sounder 
sort 
reason 
on 
that 
question 
like 
the 
generality 
of 
men, 
and 
as 
unprejudiced 
people 
always 
have 
reasoned. 
They 
assume 
that 
freedom 
lies 
in 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
and 
the 
inclinations, 
which 
cause 
the 
choice 
or 
rejection 
of 
objects. 
But 
finally 
some 
rather 
too 
subtle 
philosophers 
have 
extracted 
from 
their 
alembic 
an 
inexplicable 
notion 
of 
choice 
independent 
of 
anything 
whatsoever, 
whichissaidtodo 
wondersin 
solving 
all 
difficulties. 
But 
the 
notion 
is 
caught 
up 
at 
the 
outset 
in 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
difficulties, 
by 
offending 
against 
the 
grand 
principle 
of 
reasoning 
which 
makes 
us 
always 
assume 
that 
nothing 
is 
done 
without 
some 
sufficient 
cause 
or 
reason. 
As 
the 
Schoolmen 
often 
forgot 
to 
apply 
this 
great 
principle, 
admitting 
certain 
prime 
occult 
qualities, 
one 
need 
not 
wonder 
if 
this 
fiction 
of 
vague 
indifference 
met 
with 
applause 
amongst 
them, 
and 
if 
even 
most 
worthy 
men 
have 
been 
imbued 
therewith. 
Our 
author, 
who 
is 
otherwise 
rid 
of 
many 

of 
the 
errors 
of 
the 
ordinary 
Schoolmen, 
is 
still 
deluded 
by 
this 
fiction: 
but 
he 
is 
without 
doubtoneof

He 
gives 
it 
the 
best 
possible 
turn, 
and 
only 
shows 
it 
on 
its 
good 
side. 
He 
knows 
how 
to 
strip 
spontaneity 
and 
reason 
of 
their 
advantages, 
transferring 
all 
these 
to 
vague 
indifference: 
only 
through 
this 
indifference 
is 
one 
active, 
resisting 
the 
passions, 
taking 
pleasure 
in 
one’s 
choice, 
or 
being 
happy; 
it 
appears 
indeed 
that 
one 
would 
be 
miserable 
if 
some 
happy 
necessity 
should 
oblige 
us 
to 
choose 
aright. 
Our 
author 
had 
said 
admirable 
things 
on 
the 
origin 
and 
reasons 
of 
natural 
evils: 
he 
only 
had 
to 
apply 
the 
same 
principles 
to 
moral 
evil; 
indeed, 
he 
believes 
himself 
that 
moral 
evil 
becomes 
an 
evil 
through 
the 
physical 
evils 
that 
it 
causes 
or 
tends 
to 
cause. 
But 
somehow 
or 
other 
he 
thinks 
that 
it 
would 
be 
a 
degradation 
of 
God 
and 
men 
if 
they 
were 
to 
be 
made 
subject 
to 
reason; 
that 
thus 
they 
would 
all 
be 
rendered 
passive 
to 
it 
and 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
satisfied 
with 
themselves; 
in 
short 
that 
men 
would 
have 
nothing 
wherewith 
to 
oppose 
the 
misfortunes 
that 
come 
to 
them 
from 
without, 
if 
they 
had 
not 
within 
them 
this 
admirable 
privilege 
of 
rendering 
things 
good 
or 
tolerable 
by 
choosing 
them, 
and 
of 
changing 
all 
into 
gold 
by 
thetouchofthiswondrousfaculty. 


4. 
We 
will 
examine 
it 
in 
closer 
detail 
presently; 
but 
it 
will 
be 
well 
to 
profit 
beforehand 
by 
the 
excellent 
ideas 
of 
our 
author 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
and 
on 
natural 
evils, 
particularly 
since 
there 
are 
some 
points 
in 
which 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
go 
a 
little 
further: 
by 
this 
means 
also 
we 
shall 
gain 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
whole 
arrangement 
of 
his 
system. 
The 
first 
chapter 
contains 
the 
principles. 
The 
writer 
calls 
substance 
a 
being 
the 
idea 
of 
which 
does 
not 
involve 
the 
existence 
of 
another. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
if 
there 
are 
any 
such 
among 
created 
beings, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
connexion 
existing 
between 
all 

things; 
and 
the 
example 
of 
a 
wax 
torch 
is 
not 
the 
example 
of 
a 
substance, 
any 
more 
than 
that 
of 
a 
swarm 
of 
bees 
would 
be. 
But 
one 
may 
take 
the 
terms 
in 
an 
extended 
sense. 
He 
observes 
aptly 
that 
after 
all 
the 
changes 
of 
matter 
and 
after 
all 
the 
qualities 
of 
which 
it 
may 
be 
divested, 
there 
remain 
extension, 
mobility, 
divisibility 
and 
resistance. 
He 
explains 
also 
the 
nature 
of 
notions, 
and 
leaves 
it 
to 
be 
understood 
that 
universals 
indicate 
only 
the 
resemblances 
which 
exist 
between 
individuals; 
that 
we 
understand 
by 
ideas 
only 
that 
which 
is 
known 
through 
an 
immediate 
sensation, 
and 
that 
the 
rest 
is 
known 
to 
us 
only 
through 
relations 
with 
these 
ideas. 
But 
when 
he 
admits 
that 
we 
have 
no 
idea 
of 
God, 
of 
spirit, 
of 
substance, 
he 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
observed 
sufficiently 
that 
we 
have 
immediate 
apperception 
of 
substance 
and 
of 
spirit 
in 
our 
apperception 
of 
ourselves, 
and 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
God 
is 
found 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
ourselves 
through 
a 
suppression 
of 
the 
limits 
of 
our 
perfections, 
as 
extension 
taken 
in 
an 
absolute 
sense 
is 
comprised 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
globe. 
He 
is 
right 
also 
in 
asserting 
that 
our 
simple 
ideas 
at 
least 
are 
innate, 
and 
in 
rejecting 
the 
Tabula 
rasa 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
of 
Mr. 
Locke. 
But 
I 
cannot 
agree 
with 
him 
that 
our 
ideas 
have 
scarce 
any 
more 
relation 
to 
things 
than 
words 
uttered 
into 
the 
air 
or 
writings 
traced 
upon 
paper 
have 
to 
our 
ideas, 
and 
that 
the 
bearing 
of 
our 
sensations 
is 
arbitrary 
and 
ex 
instituto, 
like 
the 
signification 
of 
words. 
I 
have 
already 
indicated 
elsewhere 
why 
I 
am 
not 
in 
agreement 
with 
our 
Cartesians 
onthatpoint. 


5. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
advancing 
to 
the 
first 
Cause, 
the 
author 
seeks 
a 
criterion, 
a 
distinguishing 
mark 
of 
truth; 
and 
he 
finds 
it 
in 
the 
force 
whereby 
our 
inward 
assertions, 
when 
they 
are 
evident, 
compel 
the 
understanding 
to 
give 
them 
its 
consent. 
It 
is 
by 
such 
a 
process, 
he 
says, 
that 
we 
credit 
the 
senses. 
He 
points 
out 
that 
the 
distinguishing 
mark 
in 
the 
Cartesian 
scheme, 
to 
wit, 
a 
clear 
and 
distinct 
perception, 
has 
need 
of 
a 
new 
mark 
to 
indicate 
what 
is 
clear 
and 
distinct, 
and 
that 
the 
congruity 
or 
non-congruity 
of 
ideas 
(or 

rather 
of 
terms, 
as 
one 
spoke 
formerly) 
may 
still 
be 
deceptive, 
because 
there 
are 
congruities 
real 
and 
apparent. 
He 
appears 
to 
recognize 
even 
that 
the 
inward 
force 
which 
constrains 
us 
to 
give 
our 
assent 
is 
still 
a 
matter 
for 
caution, 
and 
may 
come 
from 
deep-rooted 
prejudices. 
That 
is 
why 
he 
confesses 
that 
he 
who 
should 
furnish 
another 
criterion 
would 
have 
found 
something 
very 
advantageous 
to 
the 
human 
race. 
I 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
explain 
this 
criterion 
in 
a 
little 
Discourse 
on 
Truth 
and 
Ideas, 
published 
in 
1684; 
and 
although 
I 
do 
not 
boast 
of 
having 
given 
therein 
a 
new 
discovery 
I 
hope 
that 
I 
have 
expounded 
things 
which 
were 
only 
confusedly 
recognized. 
I 
distinguish 
between 
truths 
of 
fact 
and 
truths 
of 
reason. 
Truths 
of 
fact 
can 
only 
be 
verified 
by 
confronting 
them 
with 
truths 
of 
reason, 
and 
by 
tracing 
them 
back 
to 
immediate 
perceptions 
within 
us, 
such 
as 
St. 
Augustine 
and 
M. 
Descartes 
very 
promptly 
acknowledged 
to 
be 
indubitable; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
we 
cannot 
doubt 
that 
we 
think, 
nor 
indeed 
that 
we 
think 
this 
thing 
or 
that. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
judge 
whether 
our 
inward 
notions 
have 
any 
reality 
in 
things, 
and 
to 
pass 
from 
thoughts 
to 
objects, 
my 
opinion 
is 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
consider 
whether 
our 
perceptions 
are 
firmly 
connected 
among 
themselves 
and 
with 
others 
that 
we 
have 
had, 
in 
such 
fashion 
as 
to 
manifest 
the 
rules 
of 
mathematics 
and 
other 
truths 
of 
reason. 
In 
this 
case 
one 
must 
regard 
them 
as 
real; 
and 
I 
think 
that 
it 
is 
the 
only 
means 
of 
distinguishing 
them 
from 
imaginations, 
dreams 
and 
visions. 
Thus 
the 
truth 
of 
things 
outside 
us 
can 
be 
recognized 
only 
through 
the 
connexion 
of 
phenomena. 
The 
criterion 
of 
the 
truths 
of 
reason, 
or 
those 
which 
spring 
from 
conceptions, 
is 
found 
in 
an 
exact 
use 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
logic. 
As 
for 
ideas 
or 
notions, 
I 
call 
real 
all 
those 
the 
possibility 
of 
which 
is 
certain; 
and 
the 
definitions 
which 
do 
not 
mark 
this 
possibility 
are 
only 
nominal. 
Geometricians 
well 
versed 
in 
analysis 
are 
aware 
what 
difference 
there 
is 
in 
this 
respect 
between 
several 
properties 
by 
which 
some 
line 
or 
figure 
might 
be 
defined. 
Our 
gifted 
author 
has 
not 
gone 
so 
far, 



perhaps; 
one 
may 
see, 
however, 
from 
the 
account 
I 
have 
given 
of 
him 
already, 
and 
from 
what 
follows, 
that 
he 
is 
by 
no 
means 
lacking 
in 
profundity 
orreflexion. 


6. 
Thereafter 
he 
proceeds 
to 
examine 
whether 
motion, 
matter 
and 
space 
spring 
from 
themselves; 
and 
to 
that 
end 
he 
considers 
whether 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
conceive 
that 
they 
do 
not 
exist. 
He 
remarks 
upon 
this 
privilege 
of 
God, 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
he 
exists 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
he 
exists 
of 
necessity. 
This 
is 
a 
corollary 
to 
a 
remark 
which 
I 
made 
in 
the 
little 
discourse 
mentioned 
above, 
namely 
that 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
admits 
that 
God 
is 
possible, 
one 
must 
admit 
that 
he 
exists 
of 
necessity. 
Now, 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
admits 
that 
God 
exists, 
one 
admits 
that 
he 
is 
possible. 
Therefore 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
admits 
that 
God 
exists, 
one 
must 
admit 
that 
he 
exists 
of 
necessity. 
Now 
this 
privilege 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
the 
three 
things 
of 
which 
we 
have 
just 
spoken. 
The 
author 
believes 
also 
especially 
concerning 
motion, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
say, 
with 
Mr. 
Hobbes, 
that 
the 
present 
movement 
comes 
from 
an 
anterior 
movement, 
and 
this 
one 
again 
from 
another, 
and 
so 
on 
to 
infinity. 
For, 
however 
far 
back 
you 
may 
go, 
you 
will 
not 
be 
one 
whit 
nearer 
to 
finding 
the 
reason 
which 
causes 
the 
presence 
of 
motion 
in 
matter. 
Therefore 
this 
reason 
must 
be 
outside 
the 
sequence; 
and 
even 
if 
there 
were 
an 
eternal 
motion, 
it 
would 
require 
an 
eternal 
motive 
power. 
So 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
sun, 
even 
though 
they 
were 
eternal 
with 
the 
sun, 
would 
nevertheless 
have 
their 
eternal 
cause 
in 
the 
sun. 
I 
am 
well 
pleased 
to 
recount 
these 
arguments 
of 
our 
gifted 
author, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
seen 
how 
important, 
according 
to 
him, 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
sufficient 
reason. 
For, 
if 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
admit 
something 
for 
which 
it 
is 
acknowledged 
there 
is 
no 
reason, 
it 
will 
be 
easy 
for 
an 
atheist 
to 
overthrow 
this 
argument, 
by 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
there 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
motion. 
I 
will 
not 
enter 
into 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
reality 
and 
the 
eternity 
of 
space, 
for 
fear 
of 
straying 
too 
far 
from 
our 
subject. 

It 
is 
enough 
to 
state 
that 
the 
author 
believes 
that 
space 
can 
be 
annihilated 
by 
the 
divine 
power, 
but 
in 
entirety 
and 
not 
in 
portions, 
and 
that 
we 
could 
exist 
alone 
with 
God 
even 
if 
there 
were 
neither 
space 
nor 
matter, 
since 
we 
do 
not 
contain 
within 
ourselves 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
external 
things. 
He 
also 
puts 
forward 
the 
consideration 
that 
in 
the 
sensations 
of 
sounds, 
of 
odours 
and 
of 
savours 
the 
idea 
of 
space 
is 
not 
included. 
But 
whatever 
the 
opinion 
formed 
as 
to 
space, 
it 
suffices 
that 
there 
is 
a 
God, 
the 
cause 
of 
matter 
and 
of 
motion, 
and 
in 
short 
of 
all 
things. 
The 
author 
believes 
that 
we 
can 
reason 
about 
God, 
as 
one 
born 
blind 
would 
reason 
about 
light. 
But 
I 
hold 
that 
there 
is 
something 
more 
in 
us, 
for 
our 
light 
is 
a 
ray 
from 
God’s 
light. 
After 
having 
spoken 
of 
some 
attributes 
of 
God, 
the 
author 
acknowledges 
that 
God 
acts 
for 
an 
end, 
which 
is 
the 
communication 
of 
his 
goodness, 
and 
that 
his 
works 
are 
ordered 
aright. 
Finally 
he 
concludes 
this 
chapter 
very 
properly, 
by 
saying 
that 
God 
in 
creating 
the 
world 
was 
at 
pains 
to 
give 
it 
the 
greatest 
harmony 
amongst 
things, 
the 
greatest 
comfort 
of 
beings 
endowed 
with 
reason, 
and 
the 
greatest 
compatibility 
in 
desires 
that 
an 
infinite 
power, 
wisdom 
and 
goodness 
combined 
could 
produce. 
He 
adds 
that, 
if 
some 
evil 
has 
remained 
notwithstanding, 
one 
must 
believe 
that 
these 
infinite 
divine 
perfections 
could 
nothave(I 
wouldrathersay 
ought 
nottohave) 
taken 
itaway. 


7. 
Chapter 
II 
anatomizes 
evil, 
dividing 
it 
as 
we 
do 
into 
metaphysical, 
physical 
and 
moral. 
Metaphysical 
evil 
consists 
in 
imperfections, 
physical 
evil 
in 
suffering 
and 
other 
like 
troubles, 
and 
moral 
evil 
in 
sin. 
All 
these 
evils 
exist 
in 
God’s 
work; 
Lucretius 
thence 
inferred 
that 
there 
is 
no 
providence, 
and 
he 
deniedthattheworld 
canbean 
effectof 
divinity: 
Naturam 
rerum 
divinitus 
esse 
creatam; 


becausethere 
are 
somanyfaults 
inthenatureof 
things, 


quoniam 
tanta 
stat 
praedita 
culpa. 



Others 
have 
admitted 
two 
principles, 
the 
one 
good, 
the 
other 
evil. 
There 
have 
also 
been 
people 
who 
thought 
the 
difficulty 
insurmountable, 
and 
among 
these 
our 
author 
appears 
to 
have 
had 
M. 
Bayle 
in 
mind. 
He 
hopes 
to 
show 
in 
his 
work 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
Gordian 
knot, 
which 
needs 
to 
be 
cut; 
and 
he 
says 
rightly 
that 
the 
power, 
the 
wisdom 
and 
the 
goodness 
of 
God 
would 
not 
be 
infinite 
and 
perfect 
in 
their 
exercise 
if 
these 
evils 
had 
been 
banished. 
He 
begins 
with 
the 
evil 
of 
imperfection 
in 
Chapter 
III 
and 
observes, 
as 
St. 
Augustine 
does, 
that 
creatures 
are 
imperfect, 
since 
they 
are 
derived 
from 
nothingness, 
whereas 
God 
producing 
a 
perfect 
substance 
from 
his 
own 
essence 
would 
have 
made 
thereof 
a 
God. 
This 
gives 
him 
occasion 
for 
making 
a 
little 
digression 
against 
the 
Socinians. 
But 
someone 
will 
say, 
why 
did 
not 
God 
refrain 
from 
producing 
things, 
rather 
than 
make 
imperfect 
things? 
The 
author 
answers 
appositely 
that 
the 
abundance 
of 
the 
goodness 
of 
God 
is 
the 
cause. 
He 
wished 
to 
communicate 
himself 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
a 
certain 
fastidiousness 
which 
we 
assume 
in 
God, 
imagining 
that 
imperfections 
offend 
him. 
Thus 
he 
preferred 
that 
there 
should 
be 
the 
imperfect 
rather 
than 
nothing. 
But 
one 
might 
have 
added 
that 
God 
has 
produced 
indeed 
the 
most 
perfect 
whole 
that 
was 
possible, 
one 
wherewith 
he 
had 
full 
cause 
for 
satisfaction, 
the 
imperfections 
of 
the 
parts 
serving 
a 
greater 
perfection 
in 
the 
whole. 
Also 
the 
observation 
is 
made 
soon 
afterwards, 
that 
certain 
things 
might 
have 
been 
made 
better, 
but 
not 
without 
other 
new 
and 
perhaps 
greater 
disadvantages. 
This 
perhaps 
could 
have 
been 
omitted: 
for 
the 
author 
also 
states 
as 
a 
certainty, 
andrightlyso, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
chapter, 
that 
it 
appertains 
to 
infinite 
goodness 
to 
choose 
the 
best; 
and 
thus 
he 
was 
able 
to 
draw 
this 
conclusion 
a 
littleearlier, 
thatimperfectthings 
willbeaddedtothosemoreperfect, 
solong 
as 
they 
do 
not 
preclude 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
more 
perfect 
in 
as 
great 
a 
number 
as 
possible. 
Thus 
bodies 
were 
created 
as 
well 
as 
spirits, 
since 
the 
one 
does 
not 
offer 
any 
obstacle 
to 
the 
other; 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
matter 
was 
not 



unworthy 
of 
the 
great 
God, 
as 
some 
heretics 
of 
old 
believed, 
attributing 
this 
workto 
acertainDemogorgon. 


8. 
Let 
us 
now 
proceed 
to 
physical 
evil, 
which 
is 
treated 
of 
in 
Chapter 
IV. 
Our 
famous 
author, 
having 
observed 
that 
metaphysical 
evil, 
or 
imperfection, 
springs 
from 
nothingness, 
concludes 
that 
physical 
evil, 
or 
discomfort, 
springs 
from 
matter, 
or 
rather 
from 
its 
movement; 
for 
without 
movement 
matter 
would 
be 
useless. 
Moreover 
there 
must 
be 
contrariety 
in 
these 
movements; 
otherwise, 
if 
all 
went 
together 
in 
the 
same 
direction, 
there 
would 
be 
neither 
variety 
nor 
generation. 
But 
the 
movements 
that 
cause 
generations 
cause 
also 
corruptions, 
since 
from 
the 
variety 
of 
movements 
comes 
concussion 
between 
bodies, 
by 
which 
they 
are 
often 
dissipated 
and 
destroyed. 
The 
Author 
of 
Nature 
however, 
in 
order 
to 
render 
bodies 
more 
enduring, 
distributed 
them 
into 
systems, 
those 
which 
we 
know 
being 
composed 
of 
luminous 
and 
opaque 
balls, 
in 
a 
manner 
so 
excellentand 
sofittingfor 
the 
display 
ofthatwhichthey 
contain, 
and 
for 
arousing 
wonder 
thereat, 
that 
we 
can 
conceive 
of 
nothing 
more 
beautiful. 
But 
the 
crowning 
point 
of 
the 
work 
was 
the 
construction 
of 
animals, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
everywhere 
there 
should 
be 
creatures 
capable 
of 
cognition, 
Ne 
regio 
foret 
ulla 
suis 
animalibus 
orba. 


Our 
sagacious 
author 
believes 
that 
the 
air 
and 
even 
the 
purest 
aether 
have 
their 
denizens 
as 
well 
as 
the 
water 
and 
the 
earth. 
But 
supposing 
that 
there 
were 
places 
without 
animals, 
these 
places 
might 
have 
uses 
necessary 
for 
otherplaceswhichareinhabited. 
Soforexamplethemountains,which 
render 
the 
surface 
of 
our 
globe 
unequal 
and 
sometimes 
desert 
and 
barren, 
are 
of 
use 
for 
the 
production 
of 
rivers 
and 
of 
winds; 
and 
we 
have 
no 
cause 
to 
complain 
of 
sands 
and 
marshes, 
since 
there 
are 
so 
many 
places 
still 
remaining 
to 
be 
cultivated. 
Moreover, 
it 
must 
not 
be 
supposed 
that 
all 
is 
made 
for 
man 
alone: 
and 
the 
author 
is 
persuaded 
that 
there 
are 
not 
only 
pure 
spirits 
but 
also 



immortalanimalsofanature 
akintothesespirits,thatis, 
animalswhosesouls 
are 
united 
to 
an 
ethereal 
and 
incorruptible 
matter. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
animals 
whose 
body 
is 
terrestrial, 
composed 
of 
tubes 
and 
fluids 
which 
circulate 
therein, 
and 
whose 
motion 
is 
terminated 
by 
the 
breaking 
of 
the 
vessels. 
Thence 
the 
author 
is 
led 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
immortality 
granted 
to 
Adam, 
if 
he 
had 
been 
obedient, 
would 
not 
have 
been 
an 
effect 
of 
his 
nature, 
butofthegraceofGod. 


9. 
Now 
it 
was 
necessary 
for 
the 
conservation 
of 
corruptible 
animals 
that 
they 
should 
have 
indications 
causing 
them 
to 
recognize 
a 
present 
danger, 
and 
giving 
them 
the 
inclination 
to 
avoid 
it. 
That 
is 
why 
what 
is 
about 
to 
cause 
a 
great 
injury 
must 
beforehand 
cause 
pain 
such 
as 
may 
force 
the 
animal 
to 
efforts 
capable 
of 
repulsing 
or 
shunning 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
discomfort, 
and 
of 
forestalling 
a 
greater 
evil. 
The 
dread 
of 
death 
helps 
also 
to 
cause 
its 
avoidance: 
for 
it 
if 
were 
not 
so 
ugly 
and 
if 
the 
dissolution 
of 
continuity 
were 
not 
so 
painful, 
very 
often 
animals 
would 
take 
no 
precautions 
against 
perishing, 
or 
allowing 
the 
parts 
of 
their 
body 
to 
perish, 
and 
the 
strongest 
would 
havedifficultyinsubsisting 
forawholeday. 
God 
has 
also 
given 
hunger 
and 
thirst 
to 
animals, 
to 
compel 
them 
to 
feed 
and 
maintain 
themselves 
by 
replacing 
that 
which 
is 
used 
up 
and 
which 
disappears 
imperceptibly. 
These 
appetites 
are 
of 
use 
also 
to 
prompt 
them 
to 
work, 
in 
order 
to 
procure 
a 
nourishment 
meet 
for 
their 
constitution, 
and 
which 
may 
avail 
to 
invigorate 
them. 
It 
was 
even 
found 
necessary 
by 
the 
Author 
of 
things 
that 
one 
animal 
very 
often 
should 
serve 
as 
food 
for 
another. 
This 
hardly 
renders 
the 
victim 
more 
unhappy, 
since 
death 
caused 
by 
diseases 
is 
generally 
just 
as 
painful 
as 
a 
violent 
death, 
if 
not 
more 
so; 
and 
animals 
subject 
to 
being 
preyed 
upon 
by 
others, 
having 
neither 
foresight 
nor 
anxiety 
forthefuture, 
havea

do 
not

and 
which 
men 
have 
ordinarily 
no 
cause 
to

sincetherearefewthatsufferthereby. 


10. 
The 
Author 
of 
Nature 
has 
compensated 
for 
these 
evils 
and 
others, 
which 
happen 
only 
seldom, 
with 
a 
thousand 
advantages 
that 
are 
ordinary 
and 
constant. 
Hunger 
and 
thirst 
augment 
the 
pleasure 
experienced 
in 
the 
taking 
of 
nourishment. 
Moderate 
work 
is 
an 
agreeable 
exercise 
of 
the 
animal’s 
powers; 
and 
sleep 
is 
also 
agreeable 
in 
an 
altogether 
opposite 
way, 
restoring 
the 
forces 
through 
repose. 
But 
one 
of 
the 
pleasures 
most 
intense 
is 
that 
which 
prompts 
animals 
to 
propagation. 
God, 
having 
taken 
care 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
species 
should 
be 
immortal, 
since 
the 
individual 
cannot 
be 
so 
here 
on 
earth, 
also 
willed 
that 
animals 
shouldhave 
a 
great 
tenderness 
for 
their 
littleones,even 
to 
the 
point 
of 
endangering 
themselves 
for 
their 
preservation. 
From 
pain 
and 
from 
sensual 
pleasure 
spring 
fear, 
cupidity 
and 
the 
other 
passions 
that 
are 
ordinarily 
serviceable, 
although 
it 
may 
accidentally 
happen 
that 
they 
sometimes 
turn 
towards 
ill: 
one 
must 
say 
as 
much 
of 
poisons, 
epidemic 
diseases 
and 
other 
hurtful 
things, 
namely 
that 
these 
are 
indispensable 
consequences 
of 
a 
well-conceived 
system. 
As 
for 
ignorance 
and 
errors, 
it 
must 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
that 
the 
most 
perfect 
creatures 
are 
doubtless 
ignorant 
of 
much, 
and 
that 
knowledge 
is 
wont 
to 
be 
proportionate 
to 
needs. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
one 
be 
exposed 
to 
hazards 
which 
cannot 
be 
foreseen, 
and 
accidents 
of 
such 
kinds 
are 
inevitable. 
One 
must 
often 
be 
mistaken 
in 
one’s 
judgement, 
because 
it 
is 
not 
always 
permitted 
to 
suspend 
it 
long 
enough 
for 
exact 
consideration. 
These 
disadvantages 
are 
inseparable 
from 
the 
system 
of 
things: 
for 
things 
must 
very 
often 
resemble 
one 
another 
in 
a 
certain 
situation, 
the 
one 
being 
taken 
for 
the 
other. 
But 
the 
inevitable 
errors 
are 
not 
the 
most 
usual, 
nor 
the 
most 
pernicious. 
Those 
which 
cause 
us 
the 
most 
harm 
are 
wont 
to 
arise 
through 
our 
fault; 
and 
consequently 
one 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
make 
natural 
evils 
a 
pretext 
for 
taking 
one’s 
own 
life, 
since 
one 

finds 
that 
those 
who 
have 
done 
so 
have 
generally 
been 
prompted 
to 
such 
action 
byvoluntaryevils. 


11. 
After 
all, 
one 
finds 
that 
all 
these 
evils 
of 
which 
we 
have 
spoken 
come 
accidentally 
from 
good 
causes; 
and 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
infer 
concerning 
all 
we 
do 
not 
know, 
from 
all 
we 
do 
know, 
that 
one 
could 
not 
have 
done 
away 
with 
them 
without 
falling 
into 
greater 
troubles. 
For 
the 
better 
understanding 
of 
this 
the 
author 
counsels 
us 
to 
picture 
the 
world 
as 
a 
great 
building. 
There 
must 
be 
not 
only 
apartments, 
halls, 
galleries, 
gardens, 
grottoes, 
but 
also 
the 
kitchen, 
the 
cellar, 
the 
poultry-yard, 
stables, 
drainage. 
Thus 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
proper 
to 
make 
only 
suns 
in 
the 
world, 
or 
to 
make 
an 
earth 
all 
of 
gold 
and 
of 
diamonds, 
but 
not 
habitable. 
If 
man 
had 
been 
all 
eye 
or 
all 
ear, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
been 
fitted 
for 
feeding 
himself. 
If 
God 
had 
made 
him 
without 
passions, 
he 
would 
have 
made 
him 
stupid; 
and 
if 
he 
had 
wished 
to 
make 
man 
free 
from 
error 
he 
would 
have 
had 
to 
deprive 
him 
of 
senses, 
or 
give 
him 
powers 
of 
sensation 
through 
some 
other 
means 
than 
organs, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
there 
would 
not 
have 
been 
any 
man. 
Our 
learned 
author 
remarks 
here 
upon 
an 
idea 
which 
histories 
bothsacredandprofaneappearto 
inculcate,namelythat 
wildbeasts, 
poisonous 
plants 
and 
other 
natures 
that 
are 
injurious 
to 
us 
have 
been 
armed 
againstus 
bysin. 
Butasheargueshereonly 
inaccordancewiththeprinciples 
of 
reason 
he 
sets 
aside 
what 
Revelation 
can 
teach. 
He 
believes, 
however, 
that 
Adam 
would 
have 
been 
exempted 
from 
natural 
evils 
(if 
he 
had 
been 
obedient) 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
divine 
grace 
and 
of 
a 
covenant 
made 
with 
God, 
and 
that 
Moses 
expressly 
indicates 
only 
about 
seven 
effects 
of 
the 
first 
sin. 
These 
effects 
are: 
1. 
Therevocationofthegraciousgift

2.

5.

6. 
Theenmity

7. 
The 
banishment 
of 
man 
from 
the 
place 
of 
delight 
wherein 
God 
had 
placedhim. 
But 
our 
author 
thinks 
that 
many 
of 
our 
evils 
spring 
from 
the 
necessity 
of 
matter, 
especially 
since 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
grace. 
Moreover, 
it 
seems 
to 
him 
that 
after 
our 
banishment 
immortality 
would 
be 
only 
a 
burden 
to 
us, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
perhaps 
more 
for 
our 
good 
than 
to 
punish 
us 
that 
the 
tree 
of 
life 
has 
become 
inaccessible 
to 
us. 
On 
one 
point 
or 
another 
one 
might 
have 
something 
to 
say 
in 
objection, 
but 
the 
body 
of 
the 
discourse 
by 
our 
author 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
evils 
is 
full 
of 
good 
and 
sound 
reflexions, 
which 
I 
have 
judged 
it 
advisable 
to 
turn 
to 
advantage. 
Now 
I 
must 
pass 
on 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
our 
controversy,thatis,the 
explanationofthenature 
offreedom. 


12. 
The 
learned 
author 
of 
this 
work 
on 
the 
origin 
of 
evil, 
proposing 
to 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
moral 
evil 
in 
the 
fifth 
chapter, 
which 
makes 
up 
half 
of 
the 
whole 
book, 
considers 
that 
it 
is 
altogether 
different 
from 
that 
of 
physical 
evil, 
which 
lies 
in 
the 
inevitable 
imperfection 
of 
creatures. 
For, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
presently, 
it 
appears 
to 
him 
that 
moral 
evil 
comes 
rather 
from 
that 
which 
he 
calls 
a 
perfection, 
which 
the 
creature 
has 
in 
common, 
according 
to 
him, 
with 
the 
Creator, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
power 
of 
choosing 
without 
any 
motive 
and 
without 
any 
final 
or 
impelling 
cause. 
It 
is 
a 
very 
great 
paradox 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
greatest 
imperfection, 
namely 
sin, 
springs 
from 
perfection 
itself. 
But 
it 
is 
no 
less 
a 
paradox 
to 
present 
as 
a 
perfection 
the 
thing 
which 
is 
the 
least 
reasonable 
in 
the 
world, 
the 
advantage 
whereof 
would 
consist 
in 
being 
privileged 
against 
reason. 
And 
that, 
after 
all, 
rather 
than 
pointing 
out 
the 
source 
of 
the 
evil, 
would 
be 
to 
contend 
that 
it 
has 
none. 
For 
if 
the 
will 
makes 

its 
resolve 
without 
the 
existence 
of 
anything, 
either 
in 
the 
person 
who 
chooses 
or 
in 
the 
object 
which 
is 
chosen, 
to 
prompt 
it 
to 
the 
choice, 
there 
will 
be 
neither 
cause 
nor 
reason 
for 
this 
election; 
and 
as 
moral 
evil 
consists 
in 
the 
wrong 
choice, 
that 
is 
admitting 
that 
moral 
evil 
has 
no 
source 
at 
all. 
Thus 
in 
therules 
of 
goodmetaphysics 
there 
wouldhave 
to 
beno 
moralevilin 
Nature; 
and 
also 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
there 
would 
be 
no 
moral 
good 
either, 
and 
all 
morality 
would 
be 
destroyed. 
But 
we 
must 
listen 
to 
our 
gifted 
author, 
from 
whom 
the 
subtlety 
of 
an 
opinion 
maintained 
by 
famous 
philosophers 
among 
the 
Schoolmen, 
and 
the 
adornments 
that 
he 
has 
added 
thereto 
himself 
by 
his 
wit 
and 
his 
eloquence, 
have 
hidden 
the 
great 
disadvantages 
contained 
therein. 
In 
setting 
forth 
the 
position 
reached 
in 
the 
controversy, 
he 
divides 
the 
writers 
into 
two 
parties. 
The 
one 
sort, 
he 
says, 
are 
content 
to 
say 
that 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
will 
is 
exempt 
from 
outward 
constraint; 
and 
the 
other 
sort 
maintain 
that 
it 
is 
also 
exempt 
from 
inward 
necessity. 
But 
this 
exposition 
does 
not 
suffice, 
unless 
one 
distinguish 
the 
necessity 
that 
is 
absolute 
and 
contrary 
to 
morality 
from 
hypothetical 
necessity 
and 
moral 
necessity, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
explained 
inmanyplaces. 


13. 
The 
first 
section 
of 
this 
chapter 
is 
to 
indicate 
the 
nature 
of 
choice. 
The 
author 
sets 
forth 
in 
the 
first 
place 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
believe 
that 
the 
will 
is 
prompted 
by 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding, 
or 
by 
anterior 
inclinations 
of 
the 
desires, 
to 
resolve 
upon 
the 
course 
that 
it 
adopts. 
But 
he 
confuses 
these 
authors 
with 
those 
who 
assert 
that 
the 
will 
is 
prompted 
to 
its 
resolution 
by 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
and 
who 
maintain 
that 
the 
person 
who 
wills 
has 
no 
power 
over 
his 
volitions: 
that 
is, 
he 
confuses 
a 
Thomist 
with 
a 
Spinozist. 
He 
makes 
use 
of 
the 
admissions 
and 
the 
odious 
declarations 
of 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
and 
his 
like, 
to 
lay 
them 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
those 
who 
are 
infinitely 
far 
removed 
from 
them, 
and 
who 
take 
great 
care 
to 
refute 
them. 
He 
lays 
these 
things 
to 
their 
charge 
because 
they 
believe, 
as 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
believes, 
like 

everyone 
else 
(save 
for 
some 
doctors 
who 
are 
enveloped 
in 
their 
own 
subtleties), 
that 
the 
will 
is 
moved 
by 
the 
representation 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 
Thence 
he 
imputes 
to 
them 
the 
opinion 
that 
there 
is 
therefore 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
contingency, 
and 
that 
all 
is 
connected 
by 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
That 
is 
a 
very 
speedy 
manner 
of 
reasoning; 
yet 
he 
adds 
also, 
that 
properly 
speaking 
there 
will 
be 
no 
evil 
will, 
since 
if 
there 
were, 
all 
one 
could 
object 
to 
therein 
would 
be 
the 
evil 
which 
it 
can 
cause. 
That, 
he 
says, 
is 
different 
from 
the 
common 
notion, 
since 
the 
world 
censures 
the 
wicked 
not 
because 
they 
do 
harm, 
but 
because 
they 
do 
harm 
without 
necessity. 
He 
holds 
also 
that 
the 
wicked 
would 
be 
only 
unfortunate 
and 
by 
no 
means 
culpable; 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
difference 
between 
physical 
evil 
and 
moral 
evil, 
since 
man 
himself 
would 
not 
be 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
an 
action 
which 
he 
could 
not 
avoid; 
that 
evil-doers 
would 
not 
be 
either 
blamed 
or 
maltreated 
because 
they 
deserve 
it, 
but 
because 
that 
action 
may 
serve 
to 
turn 
people 
away 
from 
evil; 
again, 
for 
this 
reason 
only 
one 
would 
find 
fault 
with 
a 
rogue, 
but 
not 
with 
a 
sick 
man, 
that 
reproaches 
and 
threats 
can 
correct 
the 
one, 
and 
cannot 
cure 
the 
other. 
And 
further, 
according 
to 
this 
doctrine, 
chastisements 
would 
have 
no 
object 
save 
the 
prevention 
of 
future 
evil, 
without 
which 
the 
mere 
consideration 
of 
the 
evil 
already 
done 
would 
not 
be 
sufficient 
for 
punishment. 
Likewise 
gratitude 
would 
haveasitssoleaimthatofprocuringafreshbenefit, 
without 
whichthe 
mere 
consideration 
of 
the 
past 
benefit 
would 
not 
furnish 
a 
sufficient 
reason. 
Finally 
the 
author 
thinks 
that 
if 
this 
doctrine, 
which 
derives 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
will 
from 
the 
representation 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
were 
true, 
one 
must 
despair 
ofhuman 
felicity,sinceit 
wouldnotbein 
our 
power,andwoulddependupon 
things 
which 
are 
outside 
us. 
Now 
as 
there 
is 
no 
ground 
for 
hoping 
that 
things 
from 
outside 
will 
order 
themselves 
and 
agree 
together 
in 
accordance 
with 
our 
wishes, 
there 
will 
always 
lack 
something 
to 
us, 
and 
there 
will 
always 
be 
something 
too 
much. 
All 
these 
conclusions 
hold, 
according 
to 
him, 
against 



those 
also 
who 
think 
that 
the 
will 
makes 
its 
resolve 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
final 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding, 
an 
opinion 
which, 
as 
he 
considers, 
strips 
the 
will 
of 
its 
right 
and 
renders 
the 
soul 
quite 
passive. 
This 
accusation 
is 
also 
directed 
against 
countless 
serious 
writers, 
of 
accepted 
authority, 
who 
are 
here 
placed 
in 
the 
same 
class 
with 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
and 
Spinoza, 
and 
with 
some 
other 
discredited 
authors, 
whose 
doctrine 
is 
considered 
odious 
and 
insupportable. 
As 
for 
me, 
I 
do 
not 
require 
the 
will 
always 
to 
follow 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
understanding, 
because 
I 
distinguish 
this 
judgement 
from 
the 
motives 
that 
spring 
from 
insensible 
perceptions 
and 
inclinations. 
But 
I 
hold 
that 
the 
will 
always 
follows 
the 
most 
advantageous 
representation, 
whether 
distinct 
or 
confused, 
of 
the 
good 
or 
the 
evil 
resulting 
from 
reasons, 
passions 
and 
inclinations, 
although 
it 
may 
also 
find 
motives 
for 
suspending 
itsjudgement.

14. 
It 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
answer 
these 
objections 
to 
my 
opinion 
before 
proceeding 
to 
establish 
that 
of 
our 
author. 
The 
misapprehension 
of 
my 
opponents 
originates 
in 
their 
confusing 
a 
consequence 
which 
is 
necessary 
absolutely, 
whose 
contrary 
implies 
contradiction, 
with 
a 
consequence 
which 
is 
founded 
only 
upon 
truths 
of 
fitness, 
and 
nevertheless 
has 
its 
effect. 
To 
put 
it 
otherwise, 
there 
is 
a 
confusion 
between 
what 
depends 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction, 
which 
makes 
necessary 
and 
indispensable 
truths, 
and 
what 
depends 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
sufficient 
reason, 
which 
applies 
also 
to 
contingent 
truths. 
I 
have 
already 
elsewhere 
stated 
this 
proposition, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
in 
philosophy, 
pointing 
out 
that 
there 
are 
two 
great 
principles, 
namely, 
that 
of 
identicals 
or 
of 
contradiction, 
which 
states 
that 
of 
two 
contradictory 
enunciations 
the 
one 
is 
true 
and 
the 
other 
false, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
sufficient 
reason, 
which 
states 
that 
there 
is 
no 
true 
enunciation 
whose 
reason 
could 
not 
be 
seen 
by 
one 
possessing 
all 
the 
knowledge 
necessary 
for 
its 
complete 
understanding. 
Both 
principles 
must 
hold 
not 
only 
in 
necessary 

but 
also 
in 
contingent 
truths; 
and 
it 
is 
even 
necessary 
that 
that 
which 
has 
no 
sufficient 
reason 
should 
not 
exist. 
For 
one 
may 
say 
in 
a 
sense 
that 
these 
two 
principles 
are 
contained 
in 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
true 
and 
the 
false. 
Nevertheless, 
when 
in 
making 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
truth 
submitted 
one 
sees 
it 
depending 
upon 
truths 
whose 
contrary 
implies 
contradiction, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary. 
But 
when, 
while 
pressing 
the 
analysis 
to 
the 
furthest 
extent, 
one 
can 
never 
attain 
to 
such 
elements 
of 
the 
given 
truth, 
one 
must 
say 
that 
it 
is 
contingent, 
and 
that 
it 
originates 
from 
a 
prevailing 
reason 
which 
inclines 
without 
necessitating. 
Once 
that 
is 
granted, 
it 
is 
seen 
how 
we 
can 
say 
with 
sundry 
famous 
philosophers 
and 
theologians, 
that 
the 
thinking 
substance 
is 
prompted 
to 
its 
resolution 
by 
the 
prevailing 
representation 
of 
good 
or 
of 
evil, 
and 
this 
certainly 
and 
infallibly, 
but 
not 
necessarily, 
that 
is, 
by 
reasons 
which 
incline 
it 
without 
necessitating 
it. 
That 
is 
why 
contingent 
futurities, 
foreseen 
both 
in 
themselves 
and 
through 
their 
reasons, 
remain 
contingent. 
God 
was 
led 
infallibly 
by 
his 
wisdom 
and 
by 
his 
goodness 
to 
create 
the 
world 
through 
his 
power, 
and 
to 
give 
it 
the 
best 
possible 
form; 
but 
he 
was 
not 
led 
thereto 
of 
necessity, 
and 
the 
whole 
took 
place 
without 
any 
diminution 
of 
hisperfect 
and 
supreme 
wisdom. 
And 
I 
do 
not 
knowifitwould 
be 
easy, 
apart 
from 
the 
reflexions 
we 
have 
just 
entertained, 
to 
untie 
the 
Gordian 
knotofcontingencyandfreedom. 


15. 
This 
explanation 
dismissesall 
theobjections 
of 
our 
gifted 
opponent. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
it 
is 
seen 
that 
contingency 
exists 
together 
with 
freedom. 
Secondly, 
evil 
wills 
are 
evil 
not 
only 
because 
they 
do 
harm, 
but 
also 
because 
theyareasourceof 
harmfulthings,orofphysicalevils,awickedspiritbeing, 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
its 
activity, 
what 
the 
evil 
principle 
of 
the 
Manichaeans 
would 
be 
in 
the 
universe. 
Moreover, 
the 
author 
has 
observed 
(ch. 
4, 
sect. 
4, 
§ 
8) 
that 
divine 
wisdom 
has 
usually 
forbidden 
actions 
which 
would 
cause 
discomforts, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
physical 
evils. 
It 
is 
agreed 
that 
he 
who 
causes 
evil 

by 
necessity 
is 
not 
culpable. 
But 
there 
is 
neither 
legislator 
nor 
lawyer 
who 
by 
this 
necessity 
means 
the 
force 
of 
the 
considerations 
of 
good 
or 
evil, 
real 
or 
apparent, 
that 
have 
prompted 
man 
to 
do 
ill: 
else 
anyone 
stealing 
a 
great 
sum 
of 
money 
or 
killing 
a 
powerful 
man 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
to 
high 
office 
would 
be 
less 
deserving 
of 
punishment 
than 
one 
who 
should 
steal 
a 
few 
halfpence 
for 
a 
mug 
of 
beer 
or 
wantonly 
kill 
his 
neighbour’s 
dog, 
since 
these 
latter 
were 
tempted 
less. 
But 
it 
is 
quitethe 
opposite 
in 
the 
administration 
ofjusticewhich 
is 
authorized 
in 
the 
world: 
for 
the 
greater 
is 
the 
temptation 
to 
sin, 
the 
more 
does 
it 
need 
to 
be 
repressed 
by 
the 
fear 
of 
a 
great 
chastisement. 
Besides, 
the 
greater 
the 
calculation 
evident 
in 
the 
design 
of 
an 
evil-doer, 
the 
more 
will 
it 
be 
found 
that 
the 
wickedness 
has 
been 
deliberate, 
and 
the 
more 
readily 
will 
one 
decide 
that 
it 
is 
great 
and 
deserving 
of 
punishment. 
Thus 
a 
too 
artful 
fraud 
causes 
the 
aggravating 
crime 
called 
stellionate, 
and 
a 
cheat 
becomes 
a 
forger 
when 
he 
has 
the 
cunning 
to 
sap 
the 
very 
foundations 
of 
our 
security 
in 
written 
documents. 
But 
one 
will 
have 
greater 
indulgence 
for 
a 
great 
passion, 
because 
it 
is 
nearer 
to 
madness. 
The 
Romans 
punished 
with 
the 
utmost 
severity 
the 
priests 
of 
the 
God 
Apis, 
when 
these 
had 
prostituted 
the 
chastity 
of 
a 
noble 
lady 
to 
a 
knight 
who 
loved 
her 
to 
distraction, 
making 
him 
pass 
as 
their 
god; 
while 
it 
was 
found 
enough 
to 
send 
the 
lover 
into 
exile. 
But 
if 
someone 
had 
done 
evil 
deeds 
without 
apparent 
reason 
and 
without 
appearance 
of 
passion 
the 
judge 
would 
be 
tempted 
to 
take 
him 
for 
a 
madman, 
especially 
if 
it 
proved 
that 
he 
was 
given 
to 
committing 
such 
extravagances 
often: 
this 
might 
tend 
towards 
reduction 
of 
the 
penalty, 
rather 
than 
supplying 
the 
true 
grounds 
of 
wickedness 
and 
punishment. 
So 
far 
removed 
are 
the 
principles 
of 
our 
opponents 
from 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
tribunals 
and 
from 
the 
generalopinionofmen. 


16. 
Thirdly, 
the 
distinction 
between 
physical 
evil 
and 
moral 
evil 
will 
still 
remain, 
although 
there 
be 
this 
in 
common 
between 
them, 
that 
they 
have 
their 

reasons 
and 
causes. 
And 
why 
manufacture 
new 
difficulties 
for 
oneself 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
moral 
evil, 
since 
the 
principle 
followed 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
those 
which 
natural 
evils 
have 
raised 
suffices 
also 
to 
account 
for 
voluntary 
evils? 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
it 
suffices 
to 
show 
that 
one 
could 
not 
have 
prevented 
men 
from 
being 
prone 
to 
errors, 
without 
changing 
the 
constitution 
of 
the 
best 
of 
systems 
or 
without 
employing 
miracles 
at 
every 
turn. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
sin 
makes 
up 
a 
large 
portion 
of 
human 
wretchedness, 
and 
even 
the 
largest; 
but 
that 
does 
not 
prevent 
one 
from 
being 
able 
to 
say 
that 
men 
are 
wicked 
and 
deserving 
of 
punishment: 
else 
one 
must 
needs 
say 
that 
the 
actual 
sins 
of 
the 
non-regenerate 
are 
excusable, 
because 
they 
spring 
from 
the 
first 
cause 
of 
our 
wretchedness, 
which 
is 
original 
sin. 
Fourthly, 
to 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
becomes 
passiveandthatmanis 
notthe 
true 
cause 
of 
sin,ifhe 
is 
promptedto 
his 
voluntary 
actions 
by 
their 
objects, 
as 
our 
author 
asserts 
in 
many 
passages, 
and 
particularly 
ch. 
5, 
sect. 
1, 
sub-sect. 
3, 
§ 
18, 
is 
to 
create 
for 
oneself 
new 
senses 
for 
terms. 
When 
the 
ancients 
spoke 
of 
that 
which 
is 
εφ’ 
‛ημιν, 
or 
when 
we 
speak 
of 
that 
which 
depends 
upon 
us, 
of 
spontaneity, 
of 
the 
inward 
principle 
of 
our 
actions, 
we 
do 
not 
exclude 
the 
representation 
of 
external 
things; 
for 
these 
representations 
are 
in 
our 
souls, 
they 
are 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
modifications 
of 
this 
active 
principle 
which 
is 
within 
us. 
No 
agent 
is 
capable 
of 
acting 
without 
being 
predisposed 
to 
what 
the 
action 
demands; 
and 
the 
reasons 
or 
inclinations 
derived 
from 
good 
or 
evil 
are 
the 
dispositions 
that 
enable 
the 
soul 
to 
decide 
between 
various 
courses. 
One 
will 
have 
it 
that 
the 
will 
is 
alone 
active 
and 
supreme, 
and 
one 
is 
wont 
to 
imagine 
it 
to 
be 
like 
a 
queen 
seated 
on 
her 
throne, 
whose 
minister 
of 
state 
is 
the 
understanding, 
whilethe 
passions 
are 
her 
courtiersorfavourite 
ladies, 
who 
bytheir 
influence 
often 
prevail 
over 
the 
counsel 
of 
her 
ministers. 
One 
will 
have 
it 
that 
the 
understanding 
speaks 
only 
at 
this 
queen’s 
order; 
that 
she 
can 
vacillate 
between 
the 
arguments 
of 
the 
minister 
and 
the 
suggestions 
of 
the 
favourites, 



even 
rejecting 
both, 
making 
them 
keep 
silence 
or 
speak, 
and 
giving 
them 
audience 
or 
not 
as 
seems 
good 
to 
her. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
personification 
or 
mythology 
somewhat 
ill-conceived. 
If 
the 
will 
is 
to 
judge, 
or 
take 
cognizance 
of 
the 
reasons 
and 
inclinations 
which 
the 
understanding 
or 
the 
senses 
offer 
it, 
it 
will 
need 
another 
understanding 
in 
itself, 
to 
understand 
what 
it 
is 
offered. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
the 
soul, 
or 
the 
thinking 
substance, 
understands 
the 
reasons 
and 
feels 
the 
inclinations, 
and 
decides 
according 
to 
the 
predominance 
of 
the 
representations 
modifying 
its 
active 
force, 
in 
order 
to 
shape 
the 
action. 
I 
have 
no 
need 
here 
to 
apply 
my 
system 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony, 
which 
shows 
our 
independence 
to 
the 
best 
advantage 
and 
frees 
us 
from 
the 
physical 
influence 
of 
objects. 
For 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said 
is 
sufficient 
to 
answer 
the 
objection. 
Our 
author, 
even 
though 
he 
admits 
with 
people 
in 
general 
this 
physical 
influence 
of 
objects 
upon 
us, 
observes 
nevertheless 
with 
much 
perspicacity 
that 
the 
body 
or 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
senses 
do 
not 
even 
give 
us 
our 
ideas, 
much 
less 
the 
active 
force 
of 
our 
soul, 
and 
that 
they 
serve 
only 
to 
draw 
out 
that 
which 
is 
within 
us. 
This 
is 
much 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
M. 
Descartes’ 
belief 
that 
the 
soul, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
give 
force 
to 
the 
body, 
gives 
it 
at 
least 
some 
direction. 
It 
is 
a 
mean 
between 
one 
side 
and 
the 
other, 
between 
physical 
influenceandPre-establishedHarmony. 


17. 
Fifthly, 
the 
objection 
is 
made 
that, 
according 
to 
my 
opinion, 
sin 
would 
neither 
be 
censured 
nor 
punished 
because 
of 
its 
deserts, 
but 
because 
the 
censure 
and 
the 
chastisement 
serve 
to 
prevent 
it 
another 
time; 
whereas 
men 
demand 
something 
more, 
namely, 
satisfaction 
for 
the 
crime, 
even 
though 
it 
should 
serve 
neither 
for 
amendment 
nor 
for 
example. 
So 
do 
men 
with 
reason 
demand 
that 
true 
gratitude 
should 
come 
from 
a 
true 
recognition 
of 
the 
past 
benefit, 
and 
not 
from 
the 
interested 
aim 
of 
extorting 
a 
fresh 
benefit. 
This 
objection 
contains 
noble 
and 
sound 
considerations, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
strike 
at 
me. 
I 
require 
a 
man 
to 
be 
virtuous, 
grateful, 
just, 
not 
only 
from 
the 
motive 
of 

interest, 
of 
hope 
or 
of 
fear, 
but 
also 
of 
the 
pleasure 
that 
he 
should 
find 
in 
good 
actions: 
else 
one 
has 
not 
yet 
reached 
the 
degree 
of 
virtue 
that 
one 
must 
endeavour 
to 
attain. 
That 
is 
what 
one 
means 
by 
saying 
that 
justice 
and 
virtue 
must 
be 
loved 
for 
their 
own 
sake; 
and 
it 
is 
also 
what 
I 
explained 
in 
justifying 
‘disinterested 
love’, 
shortly 
before 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
controversy 
which 
caused 
so 
much 
stir. 
Likewise 
I 
consider 
that 
wickedness 
is 
all 
the 
greater 
when 
its 
practice 
becomes 
a 
pleasure, 
as 
when 
a 
highwayman, 
after 
having 
killed 
men 
because 
they 
resist, 
or 
because 
he 
fears 
their 
vengeance, 
finally 
grows 
cruel 
and 
takes 
pleasure 
in 
killing 
them, 
and 
even 
in 
making 
them 
suffer 
beforehand. 
Such 
a 
degree 
of 
wickedness 
is 
taken 
to 
be 
diabolical, 
even 
though 
the 
man 
affected 
with 
it 
finds 
in 
this 
execrable 
indulgence 
a 
stronger 
reason 
for 
his 
homicides 
than 
he 
had 
when 
he 
killed 
simply 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
hope 
or 
of 
fear. 
I 
have 
also 
observed 
in 
answering 
the 
difficulties 
of 
M. 
Bayle 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
celebrated 
Conringius, 
justice 
which 
punishes 
by 
means 
of 
medicinal 
penalties, 
so 
to 
speak, 
that 
is, 
in 
order 
to 
correct 
the 
criminal 
or 
at 
least 
to 
provide 
an 
example 
for 
others, 
might 
exist 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
do 
away 
with 
the 
freedom 
that 
is 
exempt 
from 
necessity. 
True 
retributive 
justice, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
going 
beyond 
the 
medicinal, 
assumes 
something 
more, 
namely, 
intelligence 
and 
freedom 
in 
him 
who 
sins, 
because 
the 
harmony 
of 
things 
demands 
a 
satisfaction, 
or 
evil 
in 
the 
form 
of 
suffering, 
to 
make 
the 
mind 
feel 
its 
error 
after 
the 
voluntary 
active 
evil 
whereto 
it 
has 
consented. 
Mr. 
Hobbes 
also, 
who 
does 
away 
with 
freedom, 
has 
rejected 
retributive 
justice, 
as 
do 
the 
Socinians, 
drawing 
on 
themselves 
the 
condemnation 
of 
our 
theologians; 
although 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
Socinianpartyarewonttoexaggeratetheideaoffreedom. 


18. 
Sixthly, 
the 
objection 
is 
finally 
made 
that 
men 
cannot 
hope 
for 
felicity 
if 
the 
will 
can 
only 
be 
actuated 
by 
the 
representation 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 
But 
this 
objection 
seems 
to 
me 
completely 
null 
and 
void, 
and 
I 
think 
it 
would 
be 

hard 
to 
guess 
how 
any 
tolerable 
interpretation 
was 
ever 
put 
upon 
it. 
Moreover, 
the 
line 
of 
reasoning 
adopted 
to 
prove 
it 
is 
of 
a 
most 
astounding 
nature: 
it 
is 
that 
our 
felicity 
depends 
upon 
external 
things, 
if 
it 
is 
true 
that 
it 
depends 
upon 
the 
representation 
of 
good 
or 
evil. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
in 
our 
own 
power, 
so 
it 
is 
said, 
for 
we 
have 
no 
ground 
for 
hoping 
that 
outward 
things 
will 
arrange 
themselves 
for 
our 
pleasure. 
This 
argument 
is 
halting 
from 
every 
aspect. 
There 
is 
no 
force 
in 
the 
inference: 
one 
might 
grant 
the 
conclusion: 
the 
argument 
may 
be 
retorted 
upon 
the 
author. 
Let 
us 
begin 
with 
the 
retort, 
which 
is 
easy. 
For 
are 
men 
any 
happier 
or 
more 
independent 
of 
the 
accidents 
of 
fortune 
upon 
this 
argument, 
or 
because 
they 
are 
credited 
with 
the 
advantageofchoosing 
without 
reason? 
Have 
they 
lessbodily 
suffering? 
Have 
they 
less 
tendency 
toward 
true 
or 
apparent 
goods, 
less 
fear 
of 
true 
or 
imaginaryevils? 
Are 
they 
any 
less 
enslaved 
by 
sensual 
pleasure, 
by 
ambition, 
by 
avarice? 
less 
apprehensive?lessenvious? 
Yes, 
our 
giftedauthorwillsay;I 
will 
prove 
it 
by 
a 
method 
of 
counting 
or 
assessment. 
I 
would 
rather 
he 
had 
proved 
it 
byexperience; 
butlet 
us 
see 
this 
proofby 
counting. 
Suppose 
that 
by 
mychoice,which 
enables 
metogivegoodness-for-me 
to 
that 
which 
Ichoose, 
I 
give 
to 
the 
object 
chosen 
six 
degrees 
of 
goodness, 
when 
previously 
there 
were 
two 
degrees 
of 
evil 
in 
my 
condition; 
I 
shall 
become 
happy 
all 
at 
once, 
and 
with 
perfect 
ease, 
for 
I 
should 
have 
four 
degrees 
surplus, 
or 
net 
good. 
Doubtless 
that 
is 
all 
very 
well; 
but 
unfortunately 
it 
is 
impossible. 
For 
what 
possibility 
is 
there 
of 
giving 
these 
six 
degrees 
of 
goodness 
to 
the 
object? 
To 
that 
end 
we 
must 
needs 
have 
the 
power 
to 
change 
our 
taste, 
or 
the 
things, 
as 
weplease. 
That 
wouldbealmostasifIcouldsaytolead,Thoushaltbegold, 
and 
make 
it 
so; 
to 
the 
pebble, 
Thou 
shalt 
be 
diamond; 
or 
at 
the 
least, 
Thou 
shalt 
looklikeit. 
Oritwouldbe 
like 
thecommonexplanation 
of 
the 
Mosaical 
passage 
which 
seems 
to 
say 
that 
the 
desert 
manna 
assumed 
any 
taste 
the 
Israelites 
desired 
to 
give 
to 
it. 
They 
only 
had 
to 
say 
to 
their 
homerful, 
Thou 



shalt 
be 
a 
capon, 
thou 
shalt 
be 
a 
partridge. 
But 
if 
I 
am 
free 
to 
give 
these 
six 
degrees 
of 
goodness 
to 
the 
object, 
am 
I 
not 
permitted 
to 
give 
it 
more 
goodness? 
I 
think 
that 
I 
am. 
But 
if 
that 
is 
so, 
why 
shall 
we 
not 
give 
to 
the 
object 
all 
the 
goodness 
conceivable? 
Why 
shall 
we 
not 
even 
go 
as 
far 
as 
twenty-four 
carats 
of 
goodness? 
By 
this 
means 
behold 
us 
completely 
happy, 
despite 
the 
accidents 
of 
fortune; 
it 
may 
blow, 
hail 
or 
snow, 
and 
we 
shall 
not 
mind: 
by 
means 
of 
this 
splendid 
secret 
we 
shall 
be 
always 
shielded 
against 
fortuitous 
events. 
The 
author 
agrees 
(in 
this 
first 
section 
of 
the 
fifth 
chapter, 
sub-sect. 
3, 
§ 
12) 
that 
this 
power 
overcomes 
all 
the 
natural 
appetites 
and 
cannot 
be 
overcome 
by 
any 
of 
them; 
and 
he 
regards 
it 
(§§ 
20, 
21, 
22) 
as 
the 
soundest 
foundation 
for 
happiness. 
Indeed, 
since 
there 
is 
nothing 
capable 
of 
limiting 
a 
power 
so 
indeterminate 
as 
that 
of 
choosing 
without 
any 
reason, 
and 
of 
giving 
goodness 
to 
theobjectthrough 
thechoice,either 
this 
goodness 
must 
exceed 
infinitely 
that 
which 
the 
natural 
appetites 
seek 
in 
objects, 
these 
appetites 
and 
objects 
being 
limited 
while 
this 
power 
is 
independent 
or 
at 
the 
least 
this 
goodness, 
given 
by 
the 
will 
to 
the 
chosen 
object, 
must 
be 
arbitrary 
and 
of 
such 
a 
kind 
as 
the 
will 
desires. 
For 
whence 
would 
one 
derive 
the 
reason 
for 
limits 
if 
the 
object 
is 
possible, 
if 
it 
is 
within 
reach 
of 
him 
who 
wills, 
and 
if 
the 
will 
can 
give 
it 
the 
goodness 
it 
desires 
to 
give, 
independently 
of 
reality 
and 
of 
appearances? 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
may 
suffice 
to 
overthrow 
a 
hypothesis 
so 
precarious, 
which 
contains 
something 
of 
a 
fairy-tale 
kind, 
optantis 
ista 
sunt, 
non 
invenientis. 
It 
therefore 
remains 
only 
too 
true 
that 
this 
handsome 
fiction 
cannot 
render 
us 
more 
immune 
from 
evils. 
And 
we 
shall 
see 
presently 
that 
when 
men 
place 
themselves 
above 
certain 
desires 
or 
certain 
aversions 
they 
do 
so 
through 
other 
desires, 
which 
always 
have 
their 
foundation 
in 
the 
representation 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 
I 
said 
also 
‘that 
one 
might 
grant 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
argument’, 
which 
states 
that 
our 
happiness 
does 
not 
depend 
absolutely 
upon 
ourselves, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
present 
state 
of 
human 



life: 
for 
who 
would 
question 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
liable 
to 
meet 
a 
thousand 
accidents 
which 
human 
prudence 
cannot 
evade? 
How, 
for 
example, 
can 
I 
avoid 
being 
swallowed 
up, 
together 
with 
a 
town 
where 
I 
take 
up 
my 
abode, 
by 
an 
earthquake, 
if 
such 
is 
the 
order 
of 
things? 
But 
finally 
I 
can 
also 
deny 
the 
inference 
in 
the 
argument, 
which 
states 
that 
if 
the 
will 
is 
only 
actuated 
by 
the 
representation 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
our 
happiness 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
ourselves. 
The 
inference 
would 
be 
valid 
if 
there 
were 
no 
God, 
if 
everything 
were 
ruled 
by 
brute 
causes; 
but 
God’s 
ordinance 
is 
that 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
happiness 
it 
suffices 
that 
one 
be 
virtuous. 
Thus, 
if 
the 
soul 
follows 
reason 
and 
the 
orders 
that 
God 
has 
given 
it, 
it 
is 
assured 
of 
its 
happiness, 
even 
though 
one 
maynotfind 
asufficiency 
thereof 
inthislife. 


19. 
Having 
thus 
endeavoured 
to 
point 
out 
the 
disadvantages 
of 
my 
hypothesis, 
our 
gifted 
author 
sets 
forth 
the 
advantages 
of 
his 
own. 
He 
believes 
that 
it 
alone 
is 
capable 
of 
saving 
our 
freedom, 
that 
all 
our 
felicity 
rests 
therein, 
that 
it 
increases 
our 
goods 
and 
lessens 
our 
evils, 
and 
that 
an 
agent 
possessing 
this 
power 
is 
so 
much 
the 
more 
complete. 
These 
advantages 
have 
almost 
all 
been 
already 
disproved. 
We 
have 
shown 
that 
for 
the 
securing 
of 
our 
freedom 
it 
is 
enough 
that 
the 
representations 
of 
goods 
and 
of 
evils, 
and 
other 
inward 
or 
outward 
dispositions, 
should 
incline 
us 
without 
constraining 
us. 
Moreover 
one 
does 
not 
see 
how 
pure 
indifference 
can 
contribute 
to 
felicity; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
more 
indifferent 
one 
is, 
the 
more 
insensitive 
and 
the 
less 
capable 
of 
enjoying 
what 
is 
good 
will 
one 
prove 
to 
be. 
Besides 
the 
hypothesis 
proves 
too 
much. 
For 
if 
an 
indifferent 
power 
could 
give 
itself 
the 
consciousness 
of 
good 
it 
could 
also 
give 
itself 
the 
most 
perfect 
happiness, 
as 
has 
been 
already 
shown. 
And 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
which 
would 
set 
limits 
to 
that 
power, 
since 
limits 
would 
withdraw 
it 
from 
its 
pure 
indifference, 
whence, 
so 
our 
author 
alleges, 
it 
only 
emerges 
of 
itself, 
or 
rather 
wherein 
it 
has 
never 
been. 
Finally 
one 
does 
not 
see 
wherein 
the 
perfection 
of 

pure 
indifference 
lies: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
there 
is 
nothing 
more 
imperfect; 
it 
would 
render 
knowledgeand 
goodness 
futile, 
and 
would 
reduce 
everything 
to 
chance, 
with 
no 
rules, 
and 
no 
measures 
that 
could 
be 
taken. 
There 
are, 
however, 
still 
some 
advantages 
adduced 
by 
our 
author 
which 
have 
not 
been 
discussed. 
He 
considers 
then 
that 
by 
this 
power 
alone 
are 
we 
the 
true 
cause 
to 
which 
our 
actions 
can 
be 
imputed, 
since 
otherwise 
we 
should 
be 
under 
the 
compulsion 
of 
external 
objects; 
likewise 
that 
by 
this 
power 
alone 
can 
one 
ascribe 
to 
oneself 
the 
merit 
of 
one’s 
own 
felicity, 
and 
feel 
pleased 
with 
oneself. 
But 
the 
exact 
opposite 
is 
the 
case: 
for 
when 
one 
happens 
upon 
the 
action 
through 
an 
absolutely 
indifferent 
movement, 
and 
not 
as 
a 
result 
of 
one’s 
good 
or 
bad 
qualities, 
is 
it 
not 
just 
as 
though 
one 
were 
to 
happen 
upon 
it 
blindly 
by 
chance 
or 
hazard? 
Why 
then 
should 
one 
boast 
of 
a 
good 
action, 
or 
why 
should 
one 
be 
censured 
for 
an 
evil 
one, 
if 
the 
thanks 
or 
blame 
redounds 
to 
fortune 
or 
hazard? 
I 
think 
that 
one 
is 
more 
worthy 
of 
praise 
when 
one 
owes 
the 
action 
to 
one’s 
good 
qualities, 
and 
the 
more 
culpable 
in 
proportion 
as 
one 
has 
been 
impelled 
to 
it 
by 
one’s 
evil 
qualities. 
To 
attempt 
to 
assess 
actions 
without 
weighing 
the 
qualities 
whence 
they 
spring 
is 
to 
talk 
at 
random 
and 
to 
put 
an 
imaginary 
indefinable 
something 
in 
the 
place 
of 
causes. 
Thus, 
if 
this 
chance 
or 
this 
indefinable 
something 
were 
the 
cause 
of 
our 
actions, 
to 
the 
exclusion 
of 
our 
natural 
or 
acquired 
qualities, 
of 
our 
inclinations, 
of 
our 
habits, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
set 
one’s 
hopes 
upon 
anything 
depending 
upon 
the 
resolve 
of 
others, 
since 
it 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
fix 
something 
indefinite, 
or 
to 
conjecture 
into 
what 
roadstead 
the 
uncertain 
weather 
ofanextravagantindifferencewill 
drive

20. 
But 
setting 
aside 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages, 
let 
us 
see 
how 
our 
learned 
author 
will 
justify 
the 
hypothesis 
from 
which 
he 
promises 
us 
so 
much 
good. 
He 
imagines 
that 
it 
is 
only 
God 
and 
the 
free 
creatures 
who 
are 
active 
in 
the 
true 
sense, 
and 
that 
in 
order 
to 
be 
active 
one 
must 
be 
determined 
by 

oneself 
only. 
Now 
that 
which 
is 
determined 
by 
itself 
must 
not 
be 
determined 
by 
objects, 
and 
consequently 
the 
free 
substance, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
free, 
must 
be 
indifferent 
with 
regard 
to 
objects, 
and 
emerge 
from 
this 
indifference 
only 
by 
its 
own 
choice, 
which 
shall 
render 
the 
object 
pleasing 
to 
it. 
But 
almost 
all 
the 
stages 
of 
this 
argument 
have 
their 
stumbling-blocks. 
Not 
only 
the 
free 
creatures, 
but 
also 
all 
the 
other 
substances 
and 
natures 
composed 
of 
substances, 
are 
active. 
Beasts 
are 
not 
free, 
and 
yet 
all 
the 
same 
they 
have 
active 
souls, 
unless 
one 
assume, 
with 
the 
Cartesians, 
that 
they 
are 
mere 
machines. 
Moreover, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
in 
order 
to 
be 
active 
one 
should 
be 
determined 
only 
by 
oneself, 
since 
a 
thing 
may 
receive 
direction 
without 
receiving 
force. 
So 
it 
is 
that 
the 
horse 
is 
controlled 
by 
the 
rider 
and 
the 
vessel 
is 
steered 
by 
the 
helm; 
and 
M. 
Descartes’ 
belief 
was 
that 
our 
body, 
having 
force 
in 
itself, 
receives 
only 
some 
direction 
from 
the 
soul. 
Thus 
an 
active 
thing 
may 
receive 
from 
outside 
some 
determination 
or 
direction, 
capable 
of 
changing 
that 
direction 
which 
it 
would 
take 
of 
itself. 
Finally, 
even 
though 
an 
active 
substance 
is 
determined 
only 
by 
itself, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
it 
is 
not 
moved 
by 
objects: 
for 
it 
is 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
object 
within 
it 
which 
contributes 
towards 
the 
determination. 
Now 
the 
representation 
does 
not 
come 
from 
without, 
and 
consequently 
there 
is 
complete 
spontaneity. 
Objects 
do 
not 
act 
upon 
intelligent 
substances 
as 
efficient 
and 
physical 
causes, 
but 
as 
final 
and 
moral 
causes. 
When 
God 
acts 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
wisdom, 
he 
is 
guided 
by 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
possibles 
which 
are 
his 
objects, 
but 
which 
have 
no 
reality 
outside 
him 
before 
their 
actual 
creation. 
Thus 
this 
kind 
of 
spiritual 
and 
moral 
motion 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
substance, 
nor 
to 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
its 
action. 
Finally, 
even 
though 
free 
power 
were 
not 
determined 
by 
the 
objects, 
it 
can 
never 
be 
indifferent 
to 
the 
action 
when 
it 
is 
on 
the 
point 
of 
acting, 
since 
the 
action 
must 
have 
its 
origin 
in 
a 
disposition 
to 
act: 
otherwise 
one 
will 
do 
anything 
from 
anything, 
quidvis 
ex 
quovis, 
and 



there 
will 
be 
nothing 
too 
absurd 
for 
us 
to 
imagine. 
But 
this 
disposition 
will 
have 
already 
broken 
the 
charm 
of 
mere 
indifference, 
and 
if 
the 
soul 
gives 
itself 
this 
disposition 
there 
must 
needs 
be 
another 
predisposition 
for 
this 
act 
of 
giving 
it. 
Consequently, 
however 
far 
back 
one 
may 
go, 
one 
will 
never 
meet 
with 
a 
mere 
indifference 
in 
the 
soul 
towards 
the 
actions 
which 
it 
is 
to 
perform. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
these 
dispositions 
incline 
it 
without 
constraining 
it. 
They 
relate 
usually 
to 
the 
objects; 
but 
there 
are 
some, 
notwithstanding, 
which 
arisevariously 
a 
subjecto 
or 
from 
thesoul 
itself,and 
which 
bringit 
about 
that 
one 
object 
is 
more 
acceptable 
than 
the 
other, 
or 
that 
the 
same 
is 
more 
acceptableatone 
timethanatanother. 


21. 
Our 
author 
continually 
assures 
us 
that 
his 
hypothesis 
is 
true, 
and 
he 
undertakes 
to 
show 
that 
this 
indifferent 
power 
is 
indeed 
found 
in 
God, 
and 
even 
that 
it 
must 
be 
attributed 
to 
him 
of 
necessity. 
For 
(he 
says) 
nothing 
is 
to 
God 
either 
good 
orbad 
increatures. 
He 
has 
no 
naturalappetite, 
tobe 
satisfied 
by 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
anything 
outside 
him. 
He 
is 
therefore 
absolutely 
indifferent 
to 
all 
external 
things, 
since 
by 
them 
he 
can 
neither 
be 
helped 
nor 
hindered; 
and 
he 
must 
determine 
himself 
and 
create 
as 
it 
were 
an 
appetite 
in 
making 
his 
choice. 
And 
having 
once 
chosen, 
he 
will 
wish 
to 
abide 
by 
his 
choice, 
just 
as 
if 
he 
had 
been 
prompted 
thereto 
by 
a 
natural 
inclination. 
Thus 
will 
the 
divine 
will 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
goodness 
in 
beings. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
there 
will 
be 
goodness 
in 
the 
objects, 
not 
by 
their 
nature, 
but 
by 
the 
will 
of 
God: 
whereas 
if 
that 
will 
be 
excluded 
neither 
good 
nor 
evil 
can 
exist 
in 
things. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
imagine 
how 
writers 
of 
merit 
could 
have 
been 
misled 
by 
so 
strange 
an 
opinion, 
for 
the 
reason 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
advanced 
here 
has 
not 
the 
slightest 
force. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
as 
though 
an 
attempt 
is 
being 
made 
to 
justify 
this 
opinion 
by 
the 
consideration 
that 
all 
creatures 
have 
their 
whole 
being 
from 
God, 
so 
that 
they 
cannot 
act 
upon 
him 
or 
determine 
him. 
But 
this 
is 
clearly 
an 
instance 
of 
self-deception. 
When 
we 
say 
that 
an 
intelligent 

substance 
is 
actuated 
by 
the 
goodness 
of 
its 
object, 
we 
do 
not 
assert 
that 
this 
object 
is 
necessarily 
a 
being 
existing 
outside 
the 
substance, 
and 
it 
is 
enough 
for 
us 
that 
it 
be 
conceivable: 
for 
its 
representation 
acts 
in 
the 
substance, 
or 
rather 
the 
substance 
acts 
upon 
itself, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
disposed 
and 
influenced 
by 
this 
representation. 
With 
God, 
it 
is 
plain 
that 
his 
understanding 
contains 
the 
ideas 
of 
all 
possible 
things, 
and 
that 
is 
how 
everything 
is 
in 
him 
in 
a 
transcendent 
manner. 
These 
ideas 
represent 
to 
him 
the 
good 
and 
evil, 
the 
perfection 
and 
imperfection, 
the 
order 
and 
disorder, 
the 
congruity 
and 
incongruity 
of 
possibles; 
and 
his 
superabundant 
goodness 
makes 
him 
choose 
the 
most 
advantageous. 
God 
therefore 
determines 
himself 
by 
himself; 
his 
will 
acts 
by 
virtue 
of 
his 
goodness, 
but 
it 
is 
particularized 
and 
directed 
in 
action 
by 
understanding 
filled 
with 
wisdom. 
And 
since 
his 
understanding 
is 
perfect, 
since 
his 
thoughts 
are 
always 
clear, 
his 
inclinations 
always 
good, 
he 
never 
fails 
to 
do 
the 
best; 
whereas 
we 
may 
be 
deceived 
by 
the 
mere 
semblances 
of 
truth 
and 
goodness. 
But 
how 
is 
it 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
be 
said 
that 
there 
is 
no 
good 
or 
evil 
in 
the 
ideas 
before 
the 
operation 
of 
God’s 
will? 
Does 
the 
will 
of 
God 
form 
the 
ideas 
which 
are 
in 
his 
understanding? 
I 
dare 
not 
ascribe 
to 
our 
learned 
author 
so 
strange 
a 
sentiment, 
which 
would 
confuse 
understanding 
and 
will, 
and 
would 
subvert 
the 
current 
use 
of 
our 
notions. 
Now 
if 
ideas 
are 
independent 
of 
will, 
the 
perfection 
or 
imperfection 
which 
is 
represented 
in 
them 
will 
be 
independent 
also. 
Indeed, 
is 
it 
by 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
for 
example, 
or 
is 
it 
not 
rather 
by 
the 
nature 
of 
numbers, 
that 
certain 
numbers 
allow 
more 
than 
others 
of 
various 
exact 
divisions? 
that 
some 
are 
more 
fitted 
than 
others 
for 
forming 
battalions, 
composing 
polygons 
and 
other 
regular 
figures? 
that 
thenumber 
six 
hasthe 
advantage 
of 
being 
theleast 
of 
all 
thenumbersthatare 
called 
perfect? 
that 
in 
a 
plane 
six 
equal 
circles 
may 
touch 
a 
seventh? 
that 
of 
all 
equal 
bodies, 
the 
sphere 
has 
the 
least 
surface? 
that 
certain 
lines 
are 
incommensurable, 
and 
consequently 
ill-adapted 
for 
harmony? 
Do 
we 
not 
see 



that 
all 
these 
advantages 
or 
disadvantages 
spring 
from 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
thing, 
and 
that 
the 
contrary 
would 
imply 
contradiction? 
Can 
it 
be 
thought 
that 
the 
pain 
and 
discomfort 
of 
sentient 
creatures, 
and 
above 
all 
the 
happiness 
and 
unhappiness 
of 
intelligent 
substances, 
are 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
God? 
And 
what 
shall 
be 
said 
of 
his 
justice? 
Is 
it 
also 
something 
arbitrary, 
and 
would 
he 
have 
acted 
wisely 
and 
justly 
if 
he 
had 
resolved 
to 
condemn 
the 
innocent? 
I 
know 
that 
there 
have 
been 
writers 
so 
ill-advised 
as 
to 
maintain 
an 
opinion 
so 
dangerous 
and 
so 
liable 
to 
overthrow 
religion. 
But 
I 
am 
assured 
that 
our 
illustrious 
author 
is 
far 
from 
holding 
it. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
this 
hypothesis 
tends 
in 
that 
direction, 
if 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
objects 
save 
what 
is 
indifferent 
to 
the 
divine 
will 
before 
its 
choice. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
God 
has 
need 
of 
nothing; 
but 
the 
author 
has 
himself 
shown 
clearly 
that 
God’s 
goodness, 
and 
not 
his 
need, 
prompted 
him 
to 
produce 
creatures. 
There 
was 
therefore 
in 
him 
a 
reason 
anterior 
to 
the 
resolution; 
and, 
as 
I 
have 
said 
so 
many 
times, 
it 
was 
neither 
by 
chance 
nor 
without 
cause, 
nor 
even 
by 
necessity, 
that 
God 
created 
this 
world, 
but 
rather 
as 
a 
result 
of 
his 
inclination, 
which 
always 
prompts 
him 
to 
the 
best. 
Thus 
it 
is 
surprising 
that 
our 
author 
should 
assert 
here 
(ch. 
5, 
sect. 
1, 
sub-sect. 
4, 
§ 
5) 
that 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
which 
could 
have 
induced 
God, 
absolutely 
perfect 
and 
happy 
in 
himself, 
to 
create 
anything 
outside 
him, 
although, 
according 
to 
the 
author’s 
previous 
declarations 
(ch. 
1, 
sect. 
3, 
§§ 
8, 
9), 
God 
acts 
for 
an 
end, 
and 
his 
aim 
is 
to 
communicate 
his 
goodness. 
It 
was 
therefore 
not 
altogether 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
him 
whether 
he 
should 
create 
or 
not 
create, 
and 
creation 
is 
notwithstanding 
a 
free 
act. 
Nor 
was 
it 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
him 
either, 
whether 
he 
should 
create 
one 
world 
rather 
than 
another; 
a 
perpetual 
chaos, 
or 
a 
completely 
ordered 
system. 
Thus 
the 
qualities 
of 
objects, 
included 
in 
their 
ideas,formedthereason 
for 
God’schoice. 



22. 
Our 
author, 
having 
already 
spoken 
so 
admirably 
about 
the 
beauty 
and 
fittingness 
of 
the 
works 
of 
God, 
has 
tried 
to 
search 
out 
phrases 
that 
would 
reconcile 
them 
with 
his 
hypothesis, 
which 
appears 
to 
deprive 
God 
of 
all 
consideration 
for 
the 
good 
or 
the 
advantage 
of 
creatures. 
The 
indifference 
of 
God 
prevails 
(he 
says) 
only 
in 
his 
first 
elections, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
God 
has 
chosen 
something 
he 
has 
virtually 
chosen, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
all 
that 
which 
is 
of 
necessity 
connected 
therewith. 
There 
were 
innumerable 
possible 
men 
equally 
perfect: 
the 
election 
of 
some 
from 
among 
them 
is 
purely 
arbitrary 
(in 
the 
judgement 
of 
our 
author). 
But 
God, 
once 
having 
chosen 
them, 
could 
not 
have 
willed 
in 
them 
anything 
contrary 
to 
human 
nature. 
Up 
to 
this 
point 
the 
author’s 
words 
are 
consistent 
with 
his 
hypothesis; 
but 
those 
that 
follow 
go 
further. 
He 
advances 
the 
proposition 
that 
when 
God 
resolved 
to 
produce 
certain 
creatures 
he 
resolved 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
by 
virtue 
of 
his 
infinite 
goodness, 
to 
give 
them 
every 
possible 
advantage. 
Nothing, 
indeed, 
could 
be 
so 
reasonable, 
but 
also 
nothing 
could 
be 
so 
contrary 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
he 
has 
put 
forward, 
and 
he 
does 
right 
to 
overthrow 
it, 
rather 
than 
prolong 
the 
existence 
of 
anything 
so 
charged 
with 
incongruities 
incompatible 
with 
the 
goodness 
and 
wisdom 
of 
God. 
Here 
is 
the 
way 
to 
see 
plainly 
that 
this 
hypothesis 
cannot 
harmonize 
with 
what 
has 
just 
been 
said. 
The 
first 
question 
will 
be: 
Will 
God 
create 
something 
or 
not, 
and 
wherefore? 
The 
author 
has 
answered 
that 
he 
will 
create 
something 
in 
order 
to 
communicate 
his 
goodness. 
It 
is 
therefore 
no 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
him 
whether 
he 
shall 
create 
or 
not. 
Next 
the 
question 
is 
asked: 
Will 
God 
create 
such 
and 
such 
a 
thing, 
and 
wherefore? 
One 
must 
needs 
answer 
(to 
speak 
consistently) 
that 
the 
same 
goodness 
makes 
him 
choose 
the 
best, 
and 
indeed 
the 
author 
falls 
back 
on 
that 
subsequently. 
But, 
following 
his 
own 
hypothesis, 
he 
answers 
that 
God 
will 
create 
such 
a 
thing, 
but 
that 
there 
is 
no 
wherefore, 
because 
God 
is 
absolutely 
indifferent 
towards 
creatures, 
who 
have 
their 
goodness 
only 
from 

his 
choice. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
our 
author 
varies 
somewhat 
on 
this 
point, 
for 
he 
says 
here 
(ch. 
5, 
sect. 
5, 
sub-sect. 
4, 
§ 
12) 
that 
God 
is 
indifferent 
to 
the 
choice 
between 
men 
of 
equal 
perfection, 
or 
between 
equally 
perfect 
kinds 
of 
rational 
creatures. 
Thus, 
according 
to 
this 
form 
of 
expression, 
he 
would 
choose 
rather 
the 
more 
perfect 
kind: 
and 
as 
kinds 
that 
are 
of 
equal 
perfection 
harmonize 
more 
or 
less 
with 
others, 
God 
will 
choose 
those 
that 
agree 
best 
together; 
there 
willtherefore 
benopureandabsoluteindifference,and 
theauthorthuscomes 
back 
to 
my 
principles. 
But 
let 
us 
speak, 
as 
he 
speaks, 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
hypothesis, 
and 
let 
us 
assume 
with 
him 
that 
God 
chooses 
certain 
creatures 
even 
though 
he 
be 
absolutely 
indifferent 
towards 
them. 
He 
will 
then 
just 
as 
soon 
choose 
creatures 
that 
are 
irregular, 
ill-shapen, 
mischievous, 
unhappy, 
chaos 
everlasting, 
monsters 
everywhere, 
scoundrels 
as 
sole 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
earth, 
devils 
filling 
the 
whole 
universe, 
all 
this 
rather 
than 
excellent 
systems, 
shapely 
forms, 
upright 
persons, 
good 
angels! 
No, 
the 
author 
will 
say, 
God, 
when 
once 
he 
had 
resolved 
to 
create 
men, 
resolved 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
give 
them 
all 
the 
advantages 
possible 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
same 
with 
regard 
to 
creatures 
of 
other 
kinds. 
I 
answer, 
that 
if 
this 
advantage 
were 
connected 
of 
necessity 
with 
their 
nature, 
the 
author 
would 
be 
speaking 
in 
accordance 
with 
his 
hypothesis. 
That 
not 
being 
so, 
however, 
he 
must 
admit 
that 
God’s 
resolve 
to 
give 
every 
possible 
advantage 
to 
men 
arises 
from 
a 
new 
election 
independent 
of 
that 
one 
which 
prompted 
God 
to 
make 
men. 
But 
whence 
comes 
this 
new 
election? 
Does 
it 
also 
come 
from 
mere 
indifference? 
If 
such 
is 
the 
case, 
nothing 
prompts 
God 
to 
seek 
the 
good 
of 
men, 
and 
if 
he 
sometimes 
comes 
to 
do 
it, 
it 
will 
be 
merely 
by 
accident. 
But 
the 
author 
maintains 
that 
God 
was 
prompted 
to 
the 
choice 
by 
his 
goodness; 
therefore 
the 
good 
and 
ill 
of 
creatures 
is 
no 
matter 
of 
indifference 
to 
him, 
and 
there 
are 
in 
him 
primary 
choices 
to 
which 
the 
goodness 
of 
the 
object 
prompts 
him. 
He 
chooses 
not 
only 
to 
create 
men, 
but 
also 
to 
create 
men 
as 
happy 
as 
it 
is 



possible 
to 
be 
in 
this 
system. 
After 
that 
not 
the 
least 
vestige 
of 
mere 
indifference 
will 
be 
left, 
for 
we 
can 
reason 
concerning 
the 
entire 
world 
just 
as 
we 
have 
reasoned 
concerning 
the 
human 
race. 
God 
resolved 
to 
create 
a 
world, 
but 
he 
was 
bound 
by 
his 
goodness 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
make 
choice 
of 
such 
a 
world 
as 
should 
contain 
the 
greatest 
possible 
amount 
of 
order, 
regularity, 
virtue, 
happiness. 
For 
I 
can 
see 
no 
excuse 
for 
saying 
that 
whereas 
God 
was 
prompted 
by 
his 
goodness 
to 
make 
the 
men 
he 
has 
resolved 
to 
create 
as 
perfect 
as 
is 
possible 
within 
this 
system, 
he 
had 
not 
the 
same 
good 
intention 
towards 
the 
whole 
universe. 
There 
we 
have 
come 
back 
again 
to 
the 
goodness 
of 
the 
objects; 
and 
pure 
indifference, 
where 
God 
would 
act 
without 
cause, 
is 
altogether 
destroyed 
by 
the 
very 
procedure 
of 
our 
gifted 
author, 
with 
whom 
the 
force 
of 
truth, 
once 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
matter 
was 
reached, 
prevailed 
over 
a 
speculative 
hypothesis, 
which 
cannot 
admit 
of 
any 
application 
to 
the 
realityof 
things. 


23. 
Since, 
therefore, 
nothing 
is 
altogether 
indifferent 
to 
God, 
who 
knows 
all 
degrees, 
all 
effects, 
all 
relations 
of 
things, 
and 
who 
penetrates 
at 
one 
and 
the 
same 
time 
all 
their 
possible 
connexions, 
let 
us 
see 
whether 
at 
least 
the 
ignorance 
and 
insensibility 
of 
man 
can 
make 
him 
absolutely 
indifferent 
in 
his 
choice. 
The 
author 
regales 
us 
with 
this 
pure 
indifference 
as 
with 
a 
handsome 
present. 
Here 
are 
the 
proofs 
of 
it 
which 
he 
gives: 
(1) 
We 
feel 
it 
within 
us. 
(2) 
We 
have 
experience 
within 
ourselves 
of 
its 
marks 
and 
its 
properties. 
(3) 
We 
can 
show 
that 
other 
causes 
which 
might 
determine 
our 
will 
are 
insufficient. 
As 
for 
the 
first 
point, 
he 
asserts 
that 
in 
feeling 
freedom 
within 
us 
we 
feel 
within 
us 
at 
the 
same 
time 
pure 
indifference. 
But 
I 
do 
not 
agree 
that 
we 
feel 
such 
indifference, 
or 
that 
this 
alleged 
feeling 
follows 
upon 
that 
of 
freedom. 
We 
feel 
usually 
within 
us 
something 
which 
inclines 
us 
to 
our 
choice. 
At 
times 
it 
happens, 
however, 
that 
we 
cannot 
account 
for 
all 
our 
dispositions. 
If 
we 
give 
our 
mind 
to 
the 
question, 
we 
shall 
recognize 
that 
the 
constitution 
of 

our 
body 
and 
of 
bodies 
in 
our 
environment, 
the 
present 
or 
previous 
temper 
of 
our 
soul, 
together 
with 
countless 
small 
things 
included 
under 
these 
comprehensive 
headings, 
may 
contribute 
towards 
our 
greater 
or 
lesser 
predilection 
for 
certain 
objects, 
and 
the 
variation 
of 
our 
opinions 
from 
one 
time 
to 
another. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
shall 
recognize 
that 
none 
would 
attribute 
this 
to 
mere 
indifference, 
or 
to 
some 
indefinable 
force 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
upon 
objects 
as 
colours 
are 
said 
to 
have 
upon 
the 
chameleon. 
Thus 
the 
author 
has 
no 
cause 
here 
to 
appeal 
to 
the 
judgement 
of 
the 
people: 
he 
does 
so, 
saying 
that 
in 
many 
things 
the 
people 
reason 
better 
than 
the 
philosophers. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
certain 
philosophers 
have 
been 
misled 
by 
chimeras, 
and 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
mere 
indifference 
is 
numbered 
among 
chimerical 
notions. 
But 
when 
someone 
maintains 
that 
a 
thing 
does 
not 
exist 
because 
the 
common 
herd 
does 
not 
perceive 
it, 
here 
the 
populace 
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
good 
judge, 
being, 
as 
it 
is, 
only 
guided 
by 
the 
senses. 
Many 
people 
think 
that 
air 
is 
nothing 
when 
it 
is 
not 
stirred 
by 
the 
wind. 
The 
majority 
do 
not 
know 
of 
imperceptible 
bodies, 
the 
fluid 
which 
causes 
weight 
or 
elasticity, 
magnetic 
matter, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
atoms 
and 
other 
indivisible 
substances. 
Do 
we 
say 
then 
that 
these 
things 
are 
not 
because 
the 
common 
herd 
does 
not 
know 
of 
them? 
If 
so, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
say 
also 
that 
the 
soul 
acts 
sometimes 
without 
any 
disposition 
or 
inclination 
contributing 
towards 
the 
production 
of 
its 
act, 
because 
there 
are 
many 
dispositions 
and 
inclinations 
which 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
perceived 
by 
the 
common 
herd, 
for 
lack 
of 
attention 
and 
thought. 
Secondly, 
as 
to 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
power 
in 
question, 
I 
have 
already 
refuted 
the 
claim 
advanced 
for 
it, 
that 
it 
possesses 
the 
advantage 
of 
making 
one 
active, 
the 
real 
cause 
of 
one’s 
action, 
and 
subject 
to 
responsibility 
and 
morality: 
these 
are 
notgenuine 
marks 
of 
its 
existence. 
Here 
is 
one 
the 
author 
adduces, 
which 
is 
not 
genuine 
either, 
namely, 
that 
we 
have 
within 
us 
a 
power 
of 
resisting 
natural 
appetites, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
of 
resisting 
not 



only 
the 
senses, 
but 
also 
the 
reason. 
But 
I 
have 
already 
stated 
this 
fact: 
one 
resists 
natural 
appetites 
through 
other 
natural 
appetites. 
One 
sometimes 
endures 
inconveniences, 
and 
is 
happy 
to 
do 
so; 
but 
that 
is 
on 
account 
of 
some 
hope 
or 
of 
some 
satisfaction 
which 
is 
combined 
with 
the 
ill 
and 
exceeds 
it: 
either 
one 
anticipates 
good 
from 
it, 
or 
one 
finds 
good 
in 
it. 
The 
author 
asserts 
that 
it 
is 
through 
that 
power 
to 
transform 
appearances 
which 
he 
has 
introduced 
on 
the 
scene, 
that 
we 
render 
agreeable 
what 
at 
first 
displeased 
us. 
But 
who 
cannot 
see 
that 
the 
true 
reason 
is, 
that 
application 
and 
attention 
to 
the 
object 
and 
custom 
change 
our 
disposition 
and 
consequently 
our 
natural 
appetites? 
Once 
we 
become 
used 
to 
a 
rather 
high 
degree 
of 
cold 
or 
heat, 
it 
no 
longer 
incommodes 
us 
as 
it 
formerly 
did, 
and 
yet 
no 
one 
would 
ascribe 
this 
effect 
to 
our 
power 
of 
choice. 
Time 
is 
needed, 
for 
instance, 
to 
bring 
about 
that 
hardening, 
or 
rather 
that 
callosity, 
which 
enables 
the 
hands 
of 
certain 
workmen 
to 
resist 
a 
degree 
of 
heat 
that 
would 
burn 
our 
hands. 
The 
populace, 
whom 
the 
author 
invokes, 
guess 
correctly 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
effect, 
although 
they 
sometimes 
apply 
it 
in 
a 
laughable 
manner. 
Two 
serving-maids 
being 
close 
to 
the 
fire 
in 
the 
kitchen, 
one 
who 
has 
burnt 
herself 
says 
to 
the 
other: 
Oh, 
my 
dear, 
who 
will 
be 
able 
to 
endure 
the 
fire 
of 
purgatory? 
The 
other 
answers:Don’tbeabsurd,mygoodwoman, 
onegrowsusedtoeverything. 


24. 
But 
(the 
author 
will 
say) 
this 
wonderful 
power 
which 
causes 
us 
to 
be 
indifferent 
to 
everything, 
or 
inclined 
towards 
everything, 
simply 
at 
our 
own 
free 
will, 
prevails 
over 
reason 
itself. 
And 
this 
is 
his 
third 
proof, 
namely, 
that 
one 
cannot 
sufficiently 
explain 
our 
actions 
without 
having 
recourse 
to 
this 
power. 
One 
sees 
numbers 
of 
people 
despising 
the 
entreaties 
of 
their 
friends, 
the 
counsels 
of 
their 
neighbours, 
the 
reproaches 
of 
their 
conscience, 
discomforts, 
tortures, 
death, 
the 
wrath 
of 
God, 
hell 
itself, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
running 
after 
follies 
which 
have 
no 
claim 
to 
be 
good 
or 
tolerable, 
save 
as 
being 
freely 
chosen 
by 
such 
people. 
All 
is 
well 
in 
this 
argument, 
with 
the 

exception 
of 
the 
last 
words 
only. 
For 
when 
one 
takes 
an 
actual 
instance 
one 
will 
find 
that 
there 
were 
reasons 
or 
causes 
which 
led 
the 
man 
to 
his 
choice, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
very 
strong 
bonds 
to 
fasten 
him 
thereto. 
A 
love-affair, 
for 
example, 
will 
never 
have 
arisen 
from 
mere 
indifference: 
inclination 
or 
passion 
will 
have 
played 
its 
part; 
but 
habit 
and 
stubbornness 
will 
cause 
certain 
natures 
to 
face 
ruin 
rather 
than 
separation 
from 
the 
beloved. 
Here 
is 
another 
example 
cited 
by 
the 
author: 
an 
atheist, 
a 
man 
like 
Lucilio 
Vanini 
(that 
is 
what 
many 
people 
call 
him, 
whereas 
he 
himself 
adopts 
the 
magnificent 
name 
of 
Giulio 
Cesare 
Vanini 
in 
his 
works), 
will 
suffer 
a 
preposterous 
martyrdom 
for 
his 
chimera 
rather 
than 
renounce 
his 
impiety. 
The 
author 
does 
not 
nameVanini; 
and 
thetruth 
is 
that 
this 
man 
repudiated 
his 
wrong 
opinions, 
until 
he 
was 
convicted 
of 
having 
published 
atheistical 
dogmas 
and 
acted 
as 
an 
apostle 
of 
atheism. 
When 
he 
was 
asked 
whether 
there 
was 
aGod,hepluckedsomegrass,saying: 


Et 
levis 
est 
cespes 
qui 
probet 
esse 
Deum. 


But 
since 
the 
Attorney 
General 
to 
the 
Parliament 
of 
Toulouse 
desired 
to 
cause 
annoyance 
to 
the 
First 
President 
(so 
it 
is 
said), 
to 
whom 
Vanini 
was 
granted 
considerable 
access, 
teaching 
his 
children 
philosophy, 
if 
indeed 
he 
was 
not 
altogether 
in 
the 
service 
of 
that 
magistrate, 
the 
inquisition 
was 
carried 
through 
rigorously. 
Vanini, 
seeing 
that 
there 
was 
no 
chance 
of 
pardon, 
declared 
himself, 
when 
at 
the 
point 
of 
death, 
for 
what 
he 
was, 
an 
atheist; 
and 
there 
was 
nothing 
very 
extraordinary 
in 
that. 
But 
supposing 
there 
were 
an 
atheist 
who 
gave 
himself 
up 
for 
torture, 
vanity 
might 
be 
in 
his 
case 
a 
strong 
enough 
motive, 
as 
in 
that 
of 
the 
Gymnosophist, 
Calanus, 
and 
of 
the 
Sophist 
who, 
according 
to 
Lucian’s 
account, 
was 
burnt 
to 
death 
of 
his 
own 
will. 
Butthe 
author 
thinks 
that 
thatvery 
vanity,that 
stubbornness, 
those 
other 
wild 
intentions 
of 
persons 
who 
otherwise 
seem 
to 
have 
quite 
good 
sense, 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
appetites 
that 
arise 
from 
the 
representation 
of 



good 
and 
evil, 
and 
that 
they 
compel 
us 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
that 
transcendent 
power 
which 
transformsgood 
into 
evil, 
and 
evil 
into 
good, 
and 
the 
indifferent 
into 
good 
or 
into 
evil. 
But 
we 
do 
not 
need 
to 
go 
so 
far, 
and 
the 
causes 
of 
our 
errors 
are 
only 
too 
visible. 
Indeed, 
we 
can 
make 
these 
transformations, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
as 
with 
the 
Fairies, 
by 
a 
mere 
act 
of 
this 
magic 
power, 
but 
by 
obscuring 
and 
suppressing 
in 
one’s 
mind 
the 
representations 
of 
good 
or 
bad 
qualities 
which 
are 
naturally 
attached 
to 
certain 
objects, 
and 
by 
contemplating 
only 
such 
representations 
as 
conform 
to 
our 
taste 
or 
our 
prejudices; 
or 
again, 
because 
one 
attaches 
to 
the 
objects, 
by 
dint 
of 
thinking 
of 
them, 
certain 
qualities 
which 
are 
connected 
with 
them 
only 
accidentally 
or 
through 
our 
habitual 
contemplation 
of 
them. 
For 
example, 
all 
my 
life 
long 
I 
detest 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
good 
food, 
because 
in 
my 
childhood 
I 
found 
in 
it 
something 
distasteful, 
which 
made 
a 
strong 
impression 
upon 
me. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
certain 
natural 
defect 
will 
be 
pleasing 
to 
me, 
because 
it 
will 
revive 
within 
me 
to 
some 
extent 
the 
thought 
of 
a 
person 
I 
used 
to 
esteem 
or 
love. 
A 
young 
man 
will 
have 
been 
delighted 
by 
the 
applause 
which 
has 
been 
showered 
upon 
him 
after 
some 
successful 
public 
action; 
the 
impression 
of 
this 
great 
pleasure 
will 
have 
made 
him 
remarkably 
sensitive 
to 
reputation; 
he 
will 
think 
day 
and 
night 
of 
nothing 
save 
what 
nourishes 
this 
passion, 
and 
that 
will 
cause 
him 
to 
scorn 
death 
itself 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
his 
end. 
For 
although 
he 
may 
know 
very 
well 
that 
hewillnot 
feelwhat 
is 
said 
of 
him 
after 
his 
death, 
therepresentation 
he 
makes 
of 
it 
for 
himself 
beforehand 
creates 
a 
strong 
impression 
on 
his 
mind. 
And 
there 
are 
always 
motives 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
in 
actions 
which 
appear 
most 
useless 
and 
absurd 
to 
those 
who 
do 
not 
enter 
into 
these 
motives. 
In 
a 
word, 
a 
strong 
or 
oft-repeated 
impression 
may 
alter 
considerably 
our 
organs, 
our 
imagination, 
our 
memory, 
and 
even 
our 
reasoning. 
It 
happens 
that 
a 
man, 
by 
dint 
of 
having 
often 
related 
something 
untrue, 
which 
he 
has 
perhaps 
invented, 
finally 
comes 
to 
believe 
in 
it 
himself. 
And 
as 
one 
often 
represents 



to 
oneselfsomething 
pleasing, 
onemakesiteasy 
to 
imagine, 
and 
one 
thinks 
it 
also 
easy 
to 
put 
into 
effect, 
whence 
it 
comes 
that 
one 
persuades 
oneself 
easily 
ofwhatonewishes.

Beautiful 
print 
in 
a 
book 
will 
help 
towards 
making 
it 
persuasive 
to 
the 
reader. 
The 
air 
and 
manner 
of 
a 
speaker 
will 
win 
the 
audience 
for 
him. 
One 
will 
be 
inclined 
to 
despise 
doctrines 
coming 
from 
a 
man 
one 
despises 
or 
hates, 
or 
from 
another 
who 
resembles 
him 
in 
some 
point 
that 
strikes 
us. 
I 
have 
already 
said 
why 
one 
is 
readily 
disposed 
to 
believe 
what 
is 
advantageous 
or 
agreeable, 
and 
I 
have 
known 
people 
who 
at 
first 
had 
changed 
their 
religion 
for 
worldly 
considerations, 
but 
who 
have 
been 
persuaded 
(and 
well 
persuaded) 
afterwards 
that 
they 
had 
taken 
the 
right 
course. 
One 
sees 
also 
that 
stubbornness 
is 
not 
simply 
wrong 
choice 
persevering, 
but 
also 
a 
disposition 
to 
persevere 
therein, 
which 
is 
due 
to 
some 
good 
supposed 
to 
be 
inherent 
in 
the 
choice, 
or 
some 
evil 
imagined 
as 
arising 
from 
a 
change. 
The 
first 
choice 
has 
perchance 
been 
made 
in 
mere 
levity, 
but 
the 
intention 
to 
abide 
by 
it 
springs 
from 
certain 
stronger 
reasons 
or 
impressions. 
There 
are 
even 
some 
writers 
on 
ethics 
who 
lay 
it 
down 
that 
one 
ought 
to 
abide 
by 
one’s 
choice 
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
inconstant 
or 
appear 
so. 
Yet 
perseverance 
is 
wrong 
when 
one 
despises 
the 
warnings 
of 
reason, 
especially 
when 
the 
subject 
is 
important 
enough 
to 
be 
examined 
carefully; 
but 
when 
the 
thought 
of 
change 
is 
unpleasant, 
one 
readily 
averts 
one’s 
attention 
from 
it, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
way 
which 
most 
frequently 
leads 
one 
to 
stubbornness. 
The 
author 
wished 
to 
connect 
stubbornness 
with 
his 
so-called 
pure 
indifference. 
He 
might 
then 
have 
taken 
into 
account 
that 
to 
make 
us 
cling 
to 
a 
choice 
there 

would 
be 
need 
of 
more 
than 
the 
mere 
choice 
itself 
or 
a 
pure 
indifference, 
especially 
if 
this 
choice 
has 
been 
made 
lightly, 
and 
all 
the 
more 
lightly 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
indifference 
shown. 
In 
such 
a 
case 
we 
shall 
be 
readily 
inclined 
to 
reverse 
the 
choice, 
unless 
vanity, 
habit, 
interest 
or 
some 
other 
motive 
makes 
us 
persevere 
therein. 
It 
must 
not 
be 
supposed 
either 
that 
vengeance 
pleases 
without 
cause. 
Persons 
of 
intense 
feeling 
ponder 
upon 
it 
day 
and 
night, 
and 
it 
is 
hard 
for 
them 
to 
efface 
the 
impression 
of 
the 
wrong 
or 
the 
affront 
they 
have 
sustained. 
They 
picture 
for 
themselves 
a 
very 
great 
pleasure 
in 
being 
freed 
from 
the 
thought 
of 
scorn 
which 
comes 
upon 
them 
every 
moment, 
and 
which 
causes 
some 
to 
find 
vengeance 
sweeter 
than 
life 
itself. 


Quis 
vindicta 
bonum 
vita 
jucundius 
ipsa. 


The 
author 
would 
wish 
to 
persuade 
us 
that 
usually, 
when 
our 
desire 
or 
our 
aversion 
is 
for 
some 
object 
which 
does 
not 
sufficiently 
deserve 
it, 
we 
have 
given 
to 
it 
the 
surplus 
of 
good 
or 
evil 
which 
has 
affected 
us, 
through 
the 
alleged 
power 
of 
choice 
which 
makes 
things 
appear 
good 
or 
evil 
as 
we 
wish. 
One 
has 
had 
two 
degrees 
of 
natural 
evil, 
one 
gives 
oneself 
six 
degrees 
of 
artificial 
good 
through 
the 
power 
that 
can 
choose 
without 
cause. 
Thus 
one 
will 
have 
four 
degrees 
of 
net 
good 
(ch. 
5, 
sect. 
2, 
§ 
7). 
If 
that 
could 
be 
carried 
out 
it 
would 
take 
us 
far, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said 
here. 
The 
author 
even 
thinks 
that 
ambition, 
avarice, 
the 
gambling 
mania 
and 
other 
frivolous 
passions 
derive 
alltheir 
forcefrom 
this 
power 
(ch. 
5, 
sect. 
5,sub-sect. 
6). 
But 
thereare 
besides 
so 
many 
false 
appearances 
in 
things, 
so 
many 
imaginations 
capable 
of 
enlarging 
or 
diminishing 
objects, 
so 
many 
unjustified 
connexions 
in 
our 
arguments, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
this 
little 
Fairy, 
that 
is, 
of 
this 
inward 
power 
operating 
as 
it 
were 
by 
enchantment, 
to 
whom 
the 
author 
attributes 
all 
these 
disorders. 
Indeed, 
I 
have 
already 
said 
repeatedly 
that 
when 
we 
resolve 
upon 
some 
course 
contrary 
to 
acknowledged 
reason, 
we 
are 
prompted 
to 
it 
by 



another 
reason 
stronger 
to 
outward 
appearance, 
such 
as, 
for 
instance, 
is 
the 
pleasure 
of 
appearing 
independent 
and 
of 
performing 
an 
extraordinary 
action. 
There 
was 
in 
days 
past 
at 
the 
Court 
of 
Osnabrück 
a 
tutor 
to 
the 
pages, 
who, 
like 
a 
second 
Mucius 
Scaevola, 
held 
out 
his 
arm 
into 
the 
flame 
and 
looked 
like 
getting 
a 
gangrene, 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
mind 
was 
greater 
than 
a 
very 
acute 
pain. 
Few 
people 
will 
follow 
his 
example; 
and 
I 
do 
not 
even 
know 
if 
a 
writer 
could 
easily 
be 
found 
who, 
having 
once 
affirmed 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
power 
capable 
of 
choosing 
without 
cause, 
or 
even 
contrary 
to 
reason, 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
prove 
his 
case 
by 
his 
own 
example, 
in 
renouncing 
some 
good 
benefice 
or 
some 
high 
office, 
simply 
in 
order 
to 
display 
this 
superiority 
of 
will 
over 
reason. 
But 
I 
am 
sure 
at 
the 
least 
that 
an 
intelligent 
man 
would 
not 
do 
so. 
He 
would 
be 
presently 
aware 
that 
someone 
would 
nullify 
his 
sacrifice 
by 
pointing 
out 
to 
him 
that 
he 
had 
simply 
imitated 
Heliodorus, 
Bishop 
of 
Larissa. 
That 
man 
(so 
it 
is 
said) 
held 
his 
book 
on 
Theagenes 
and 
Chariclea 
dearer 
than 
his 
bishopric; 
and 
such 
a 
thing 
may 
easily 
happen 
when 
a 
man 
has 
resources 
enabling 
him 
to 
dispense 
with 
his 
office 
and 
when 
he 
is 
sensitive 
to 
reputation. 
Thus 
every 
day 
people 
are 
found 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
their 
advantages 
to 
their 
caprices, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
actualgoodstothe 
mere 
semblanceof 
them. 


26. 
If 
I 
wished 
to 
follow 
step 
by 
step 
the 
arguments 
of 
our 
gifted 
author, 
which 
often 
come 
back 
to 
matters 
previously 
considered 
in 
our 
inquiry, 
usually 
however 
with 
some 
elegant 
and 
well-phrased 
addition, 
I 
should 
be 
obliged 
to 
proceed 
too 
far; 
but 
I 
hope 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
avoid 
doing 
so, 
having, 
as 
I 
think, 
sufficiently 
met 
all 
his 
reasons. 
The 
best 
thing 
is 
that 
with 
him 
practice 
usually 
corrects 
and 
amends 
theory. 
After 
having 
advanced 
the 
hypothesis, 
in 
the 
second 
section 
of 
this 
fifth 
chapter, 
that 
we 
approach 
God 
through 
the 
capacity 
to 
choose 
without 
reason, 
and 
that 
this 
power 
being 
of 
the 
noblest 
kind 
its 
exercise 
is 
the 
most 
capable 
of 
making 
one 
happy, 
things 

in 
the 
highest 
degree 
paradoxical, 
since 
it 
is 
reason 
which 
leads 
us 
to 
imitate 
God 
and 
our 
happiness 
lies 
in 
following 
reason: 
after 
that, 
I 
say, 
the 
author 
provides 
an 
excellent 
corrective, 
for 
he 
says 
rightly 
(§ 
5) 
that 
in 
order 
to 
be 
happy 
we 
must 
adapt 
our 
choice 
to 
things, 
since 
things 
are 
scarcely 
prone 
to 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
us, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
in 
effect 
adapting 
oneself 
to 
the 
divine 
will. 
Doubtless 
that 
is 
well 
said, 
but 
it 
implies 
besides 
that 
our 
will 
must 
be 
guided 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
by 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
objects, 
and 
by 
true 
representations 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 
Consequently 
also 
the 
motives 
of 
good 
and 
evil 
arenotopposedto 
freedom,andthepowerofchoosingwithoutcause,far 
from 
ministering 
to 
our 
happiness, 
will 
be 
useless 
and 
even 
highly 
prejudicial. 
Thus 
it 
is 
happily 
the 
case 
that 
this 
power 
nowhere 
exists, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
‘a 
being 
of 
reasoning 
reason’, 
as 
some 
Schoolmen 
call 
the 
fictions 
that 
are 
not 
even 
possible. 
As 
for 
me, 
I 
should 
have 
preferred 
to 
call 
them 
‘beings 
of 
non-reasoning 
reason’. 
Also 
I 
think 
that 
the 
third 
section 
(on 
wrong 
elections) 
may 
pass, 
since 
it 
says 
that 
one 
must 
not 
choose 
things 
that 
are 
impossible, 
inconsistent, 
harmful, 
contrary 
to 
the 
divine 
will, 
or 
already 
taken 
by 
others. 
Moreover, 
the 
author 
remarks 
appositely 
that 
by 
prejudicing 
the 
happiness 
of 
others 
needlessly 
one 
offends 
the 
divine 
will, 
which 
desires 
that 
all 
be 
happy 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
possible. 
I 
will 
say 
as 
much 
of 
the 
fourth 
section, 
where 
there 
is 
mention 
of 
the 
source 
of 
wrong 
elections, 
which 
are 
error 
or 
ignorance, 
negligence, 
fickleness 
in 
changing 
too 
readily, 
stubbornness 
in 
not 
changing 
in 
time, 
and 
bad 
habits; 
finally 
there 
is 
the 
importunity 
of 
the 
appetites, 
which 
often 
drive 
us 
inopportunely 
towards 
external 
things. 
The 
fifthsection 
is 
designed 
to 
reconcile 
evil 
elections 
orsins 
with 
the 
power 
and 
goodness 
of 
God; 
and 
this 
section, 
as 
it 
is 
diffuse, 
is 
divided 
into 
sub-sections. 
The 
author 
has 
cumbered 
himself 
needlessly 
with 
a 
great 
objection: 
for 
he 
asserts 
that 
without 
a 
power 
to 
choose 
that 
is 
altogether 
indifferent 
in 
the 
choice 
there 
would 
be 
no 
sin. 
Now 
it 
was 
very 



easy 
for 
God 
to 
refuse 
to 
creatures 
a 
power 
so 
irrational. 
It 
was 
sufficient 
for 
themtobe 
actuated 
by 
the 
representations 
of 
goodsand 
evils; 
it 
was 
therefore 
easy, 
according 
to 
the 
author’s 
hypothesis, 
for 
God 
to 
prevent 
sin. 
To 
extricate 
himself 
from 
this 
difficulty, 
he 
has 
no 
other 
resource 
than 
to 
state 
that 
if 
this 
power 
were 
removed 
from 
things 
the 
world 
would 
be 
nothing 
but 
a 
purely 
passive 
machine. 
But 
that 
is 
the 
very 
thing 
which 
I 
have 
disproved. 
If 
this 
power 
were 
missing 
in 
the 
world 
(as 
in 
fact 
it 
is), 
one 
would 
hardly 
complain 
of 
the 
fact. 
Souls 
will 
be 
well 
content 
with 
the 
representations 
of 
goods 
and 
evils 
for 
the 
making 
of 
their 
choice, 
and 
the 
world 
will 
remain 
as 
beautiful 
as 
it 
is. 
The 
author 
comes 
back 
to 
what 
he 
had 
already 
put 
forward 
here, 
that 
without 
this 
power 
there 
would 
be 
no 
happiness. 
But 
I 
have 
given 
a 
sufficient 
answer 
to 
that, 
and 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
probability 
in 
this 
assertion 
and 
in 
certain 
other 
paradoxes 
he 
puts 
forward 
here 
to 
support 
his 
principalparadox. 


27. 
He 
makes 
a 
small 
digression 
on 
prayer 
(sub-sect. 
4), 
saying 
that 
those 
who 
pray 
to 
God 
hope 
for 
some 
change 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature; 
but 
it 
seems 
as 
though, 
according 
to 
his 
opinion, 
they 
are 
mistaken. 
In 
reality, 
men 
will 
be 
content 
if 
their 
prayers 
are 
heard, 
without 
troubling 
themselves 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
course 
of 
nature 
is 
changed 
in 
their 
favour, 
or 
not. 
Indeed, 
if 
they 
receive 
succour 
from 
good 
angels 
there 
will 
be 
no 
change 
in 
the 
general 
order 
of 
things. 
Also 
this 
opinion 
of 
our 
author 
is 
a 
very 
reasonable 
one, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
system 
of 
spiritual 
substances, 
just 
as 
there 
is 
of 
corporeal 
substances, 
and 
that 
the 
spiritual 
have 
communication 
with 
one 
another, 
even 
as 
bodies 
do. 
God 
employs 
the 
ministry 
of 
angels 
in 
his 
rule 
of 
mankind, 
without 
any 
detriment 
to 
the 
order 
of 
nature. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
put 
forward 
theories 
on 
these 
matters 
than 
to 
explain 
them, 
unless 
one 
have 
recourse 
to 
my 
system 
of 
Harmony. 
But 
the 
author 
goes 
somewhat 
further. 
He 
believes 
that 
the 
mission 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
was 
a 
great 
miracle 
in 
the 
beginning, 
but 

that 
now 
his 
operations 
within 
us 
are 
natural. 
I 
leave 
it 
to 
him 
to 
explain 
his 
opinion, 
and 
to 
settle 
the 
matter 
with 
other 
theologians. 
Yet 
I 
observe 
that 
he 
finds 
the 
natural 
efficacy 
of 
prayer 
in 
the 
power 
it 
has 
of 
making 
the 
soul 
better, 
of 
overcoming 
the 
passions, 
and 
of 
winning 
for 
oneself 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
new 
grace. 
I 
can 
say 
almost 
the 
same 
things 
on 
my 
hypothesis, 
which 
represents 
the 
will 
as 
acting 
only 
in 
accordance 
with 
motives; 
and 
I 
am 
immune 
from 
the 
difficulties 
in 
which 
the 
author 
has 
become 
involved 
over 
his 
power 
of 
choosing 
without 
cause. 
He 
is 
in 
great 
embarrassment 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
foreknowledge 
of 
God. 
For 
if 
the 
soul 
is 
perfectly 
indifferent 
in 
its 
choice 
how 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
foresee 
this 
choice? 
and 
what 
sufficient 
reason 
will 
one 
be 
able 
to 
find 
for 
the 
knowledge 
of 
a 
thing, 
if 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
for 
its 
existence? 
The 
author 
puts 
off 
to 
some 
other 
occasion 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
difficulty, 
which 
would 
require 
(according 
to 
him) 
an 
entire 
work. 
For 
the 
rest, 
he 
sometimes 
speaks 
pertinently, 
and 
in 
conformity 
with 
my 
principles, 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
moral 
evil. 
He 
says, 
for 
example 
(sub-sect. 
6), 
that 
vices 
and 
crimes 
do 
not 
detract 
from 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
universe, 
but 
rather 
add 
to 
it, 
just 
as 
certain 
dissonances 
would 
offend 
the 
ear 
by 
their 
harshness 
if 
they 
were 
heard 
quite 
alone, 
and 
yet 
in 
combination 
they 
render 
the 
harmony 
more 
pleasing. 
He 
also 
points 
out 
divers 
goods 
involved 
in 
evils, 
for 
instance, 
the 
usefulness 
of 
prodigality 
in 
the 
rich 
and 
avarice 
in 
the 
poor; 
indeed 
it 
serves 
to 
make 
the 
arts 
flourish. 
We 
must 
also 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
we 
are 
not 
to 
judge 
the 
universe 
by 
the 
small 
size 
of 
our 
globe 
and 
of 
all 
that 
is 
known 
to 
us. 
For 
thestainsand 
defects 
in 
it 
may 
befound 
asusefulfor 
enhancing 
thebeauty 
of 
the 
rest 
as 
patches, 
which 
have 
nothing 
beautiful 
in 
themselves, 
are 
by 
the 
fair 
sex 
found 
adapted 
to 
embellish 
the 
whole 
face, 
although 
they 
disfigure 
the 
part 
they 
cover. 
Cotta, 
in 
Cicero’s 
book, 
had 
compared 
providence, 
in 
its 
granting 
of 
reason 
to 
men, 
to 
a 
physician 
who 
allows 
wine 
to 
a 
patient, 
notwithstanding 
that 
he 
foresees 
the 
misuse 
which 
will 
be 
made 
thereof 
by 



the 
patient, 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
his 
life. 
The 
author 
replies 
that 
providence 
does 
what 
wisdom 
and 
goodness 
require, 
and 
that 
the 
good 
which 
accrues 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
evil. 
If 
God 
had 
not 
given 
reason 
to 
man 
there 
would 
have 
been 
no 
man 
at 
all, 
and 
God 
would 
be 
like 
a 
physician 
who 
killed 
someone 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
his 
falling 
ill. 
One 
may 
add 
that 
it 
is 
not 
reason 
which 
is 
harmful 
in 
itself, 
but 
the 
absence 
of 
reason; 
and 
when 
reason 
is 
ill 
employed 
we 
reason 
well 
about 
means, 
but 
not 
adequately 
about 
an 
end, 
or 
about 
that 
bad 
end 
we 
have 
proposed 
to 
ourselves. 
Thus 
it 
is 
always 
for 
lack 
of 
reason 
that 
one 
does 
an 
evil 
deed. 
The 
author 
also 
puts 
forward 
the 
objection 
made 
by 
Epicurus 
in 
the 
book 
by 
Lactantius 
on 
the 
wrath 
of 
God. 
The 
terms 
of 
the 
objection 
are 
more 
or 
less 
as 
follows. 
Either 
God 
wishes 
to 
banish 
evils 
and 
cannot 
contrive 
to 
do 
so, 
in 
which 
case 
he 
would 
be 
weak; 
or 
he 
can 
abolish 
them, 
and 
will 
not, 
which 
would 
be 
a 
sign 
of 
malignity 
in 
him; 
or 
again 
he 
lacks 
power 
and 
also 
will, 
which 
would 
make 
him 
appear 
both 
weak 
and 
jealous; 
or 
finally 
he 
can 
and 
will, 
but 
in 
this 
case 
it 
will 
be 
asked 
why 
he 
then 
does 
not 
banish 
evil, 
if 
he 
exists? 
The 
author 
replies 
that 
God 
cannot 
banish 
evil, 
that 
he 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
either, 
and 
that 
notwithstanding 
he 
is 
neither 
malicious 
nor 
weak. 
I 
should 
have 
preferred 
to 
say 
that 
he 
can 
banish 
evil, 
but 
that 
he 
does 
not 
wish 
to 
do 
so 
absolutely, 
and 
rightly 
so, 
because 
he 
would 
then 
banish 
good 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
he 
would 
banish 
more 
good 
than 
evil. 
Finally 
our 
author, 
having 
finished 
his 
learned 
work, 
adds 
an 
Appendix, 
in 
which 
he 
speaks 
of 
the 
Divine 
Laws. 
He 
fittingly 
divides 
these 
laws 
into 
natural 
and 
positive. 
He 
observes 
that 
the 
particular 
laws 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
animals 
must 
giveway 
to 
thegeneral 
lawsof 
bodies,thatGod 
is 
not 
in 
reality 
angered 
when 
his 
laws 
are 
violated, 
but 
that 
order 
demanded 
that 
he 
who 
sins 
should 
bring 
an 
evil 
upon 
himself, 
and 
that 
he 
who 
does 
violence 
to 
others 
should 
suffer 
violence 
in 
his 
turn. 
But 
he 
believes 
that 
the 
positive 
laws 
of 
God 
rather 
indicate 
and 
forecast 
the 
evil 
than 
cause 
its 
infliction. 
And 



that 
gives 
him 
occasion 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
eternal 
damnation 
of 
the 
wicked, 
which 
no 
longer 
serves 
either 
for 
correction 
or 
example, 
and 
which 
neverthelesssatisfies 
theretributivejusticeof 
God,althoughthewickedbring 
their 
unhappiness 
upon 
themselves. 
He 
suspects, 
however, 
that 
these 
punishments 
of 
the 
wicked 
bring 
some 
advantage 
to 
virtuous 
people. 
He 
is 
doubtful 
also 
whether 
it 
is 
not 
better 
to 
be 
damned 
than 
to 
be 
nothing: 
for 
it 
might 
be 
that 
the 
damned 
are 
fools, 
capable 
of 
clinging 
to 
their 
state 
of 
misery 
owing 
to 
a 
certain 
perversity 
of 
mind 
which, 
he 
maintains, 
makes 
them 
congratulate 
themselves 
on 
their 
false 
judgements 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
their 
misery, 
and 
take 
pleasure 
in 
finding 
fault 
with 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
For 
every 
day 
one 
sees 
peevish, 
malicious, 
envious 
people 
who 
enjoy 
the 
thought 
of 
their 
ills, 
and 
seek 
to 
bring 
affliction 
upon 
themselves. 
These 
ideas 
are 
not 
worthy 
of 
contempt, 
and 
I 
have 
sometimes 
had 
the 
like 
myself, 
but 
I 
am 
far 
from 
passing 
final 
judgement 
on 
them. 
I 
related, 
in 
§ 
271 
of 
the 
essays 
written 
to 
oppose 
M. 
Bayle, 
the 
fable 
of 
the 
Devil’s 
refusal 
of 
the 
pardon 
a 
hermit 
offers 
him 
on 
God’s 
behalf. 
Baron 
André 
Taifel, 
an 
Austrian 
nobleman, 
Knight 
of 
the 
Court 
of 
Ferdinand 
Archduke 
of 
Austria 
who 
became 
the 
second 
emperor 
of 
that 
name, 
alluding 
to 
his 
name 
(which 
appears 
to 
mean 
Devil 
in 
German) 
assumed 
as 
his 
emblem 
a 
devil 
or 
satyr, 
with 
this 
Spanish 
motto, 
Mas 
perdido, 
y 
menos 
arrepentido, 
the 
more 
lost, 
the 
less 
repentant, 
which 
indicates 
a 
hopeless 
passion 
from 
which 
one 
cannot 
free 
oneself. 
This 
motto 
was 
afterwards 
repeated 
by 
the 
Spanish 
Count 
of 
Villamediana 
when 
he 
was 
said 
to 
be 
in 
love 
with 
the 
Queen. 
Coming 
to 
the 
question 
why 
evil 
often 
happens 
to 
the 
good 
and 
good 
to 
the 
wicked, 
our 
illustrious 
author 
thinks 
that 
it 
has 
been 
sufficiently 
answered, 
and 
that 
hardly 
any 
doubt 
remains 
on 
that 
point. 
He 
observes 
nevertheless 
that 
one 
may 
often 
doubt 
whether 
good 
people 
who 
endure 
affliction 
have 
not 
been 
made 
good 
by 
their 
very 
misfortune, 
and 
whether 
the 
fortunate 
wicked 
have 
not 
perhaps 
been 



spoilt 
by 
prosperity. 
He 
adds 
that 
we 
are 
often 
bad 
judges, 
when 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
recognizing 
not 
only 
a 
virtuous 
man, 
but 
also 
a 
happy 
man. 
One 
often 
honours 
a 
hypocrite, 
and 
one 
despises 
another 
whose 
solid 
virtue 
is 
without 
pretence. 
We 
are 
poor 
judges 
of 
happiness 
also, 
and 
often 
felicity 
is 
hidden 
from 
sight 
under 
the 
rags 
of 
a 
contented 
poor 
man, 
while 
it 
is 
sought 
in 
vain 
in 
the 
palaces 
of 
certain 
of 
the 
great. 
Finally 
the 
author 
observes, 
that 
the 
greatest 
felicity 
here 
on 
earth 
lies 
in 
the 
hope 
of 
future 
happiness, 
and 
thus 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
to 
the 
wicked 
nothing 
happens 
save 
what 
is 
of 
service 
forcorrection 
or 
chastisement, 
and 
to 
thegood 
nothing 
save 
whatministers 
to 
their 
greater 
good. 
These 
conclusions 
entirely 
correspond 
to 
my 
opinion, 
and

Monadology(1714) 



Translated 
by 
Frederic 
Henry 
Hedge, 
1867 


One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
works 
of 
Leibniz’ 
later 
philosophy, 
Monadology 
(1714) 
is 
a 
short 
text 
concerning 
metaphysics 
of 
simple 
substances, 
or 
monads 
(from 
Ancient 
Greek 
μονάς 
‘unity’ 
— 
a 
term 
used 
in 
philosophy 
to 
refer 
to 
a 
most 
basic 
or 
original 
substance). 
During 
his 
last 
stay 
in 
Vienna 
from 
1712 
to 
September 
1714, 
Leibniz 
completed 
this 
treatise, 
which 
was 
intended 
as 
a 
concise 
exposition 
of 
his 
philosophy. 
There 
are 
three 
original 
manuscripts 
of 
the 
text: 
the 
first 
written 
by 
Leibniz 
and 
glossed 
with 
corrections 
and 
two 
further 
emended 
copies 
with 
some 
corrections 
appearing 
in 
one 
but 
not 
the 
other. 
Leibniz 
himself 
inserted 
references 
to 
the 
paragraphs 
of 
his 
Theodicy 
(a 
justification 
of 
God), 
directing 
the 
interested 
reader 
to 
the 
larger 
work 
for 
more 
details. 


Leibniz 
allows 
just 
one 
type 
of 
element 
in 
the 
building 
of 
the 
universe. 
The 
unique 
element 
has 
been 
‘given 
the 
general 
name 
monad 
or 
entelechy’ 
and 
is 
described 
as 
‘a 
simple 
substance’. 
Leibniz 
explains 
that 
monads 
are 
‘simple’ 
and 
therefore 
‘indivisible’. 
Relying 
on 
the 
Greek 
etymology 
of 
the 
word 
entelechie, 
he 
posits 
quantitative 
differences 
in 
perfection 
between 
monadswhich 
leads 
toahierarchical 
ordering. 
Thebasicorderisthree-tiered: 


(1) 
entelechies 
or 
created 
monads, 
(2) 
souls 
or 
entelechies 
with 
perception 
and 
memory 
and 
(3) 
spirits 
or 
rational 
souls. 
God 
is 
also 
explained 
as 
a 
simple 
substance, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
only 
one 
necessary 
and 
without 
a 
body 
attached. 
Monads, 
he 
argues, 
perceive 
others 
“with 
varying 
degrees 
of 
clarity, 
except 
for 
God, 
who 
perceives 
all 
monads 
with 
utter 
clarity”. 
God 
could 
take 
any 
andallperspectives, 
knowingof 
bothpotentialityandactuality. 

At 
the 
time, 
atoms 
were 
proposed 
to 
be 
the 
smallest 
division 
of 
matter. 
Within 
Leibniz’ 
theory, 
however, 
substances 
are 
not 
technically 
real, 
so 
monads 
are 
not 
the 
smallest 
part 
of 
matter, 
rather 
they 
are 
the 
only 
things 
which 
are, 
in 
fact, 
real. 
To 
Leibniz, 
space 
and 
time 
were 
an 
illusion, 
and 
likewise 
substance 
itself. 
The 
only 
things 
that 
could 
be 
called 
real 
were 
utterly 
simple 
beings 
of 
psychic 
activity 
“endowed 
with 
perception 
and 
appetite.” 


Leibniz 
extends 
his 
theory 
of 
Monads 
to 
support 
his 
argument 
that 
we 
live 
in 
the 
best 
of 
all 
possible 
worlds. 
He 
uses 
his 
basis 
of 
perception, 
but 
not 
interaction 
among 
monads 
to 
explain 
that 
all 
monads 
must 
draw 
their 
essence 
from 
one 
ultimate 
monad. 
He 
goes 
on 
to 
claim 
that 
this 
ultimate 
monad 
would 
be 
God 
because 
a 
monad 
is 
a 
“simple 
substance” 
and 
God 
is 
simplest 
ofallsubstances

2. 
And 
there 
must 
be 
simple 
substances, 
since 
there 
are 
compounds; 
for 
thecompoundisonly 
acollectionor 
aggregate 
ofsimples. 
3. 
Wheretherearenoparts, 
neitherextension,norfigure,nor 
divisibilityis 
possible; 
and 
these 
Monads 
are 
the 
veritable 
Atoms 
of 
Nature 
— 
in 
one 
word,theElementsof 
things. 
4. 
There 
is 
thus 
no 
danger 
of 
dissolution, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
conceivable 
way 
inwhichasimplesubstancecanperish 
naturally. 
5. 
For 
the 
same 
reason, 
there 
is 
no 
way 
in 
which 
a 
simple 
substance 
can 
beginnaturally,sinceitcouldnotbeformedbycomposition. 
6. 
Therefore 
we 
may 
say 
that 
the 
Monads 
can 
neither 
begin 
nor 
end 
in 
any 
other 
way 
than 
all 
at 
once; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
they 
cannot 
begin 
except 
by 
creation, 
nor 
end 
except 
by 
annihilation; 
whereas 
that 
which 
is 
compounded, 
begins 
andends 
byparts. 
7. 
There 
is 
also 
no 
intelligible 
way 
in 
which 
a 
Monad 
can 
be 
altered 
or 
changed 
in 
its 
interior 
by 
any 
other 
creature, 
since 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
transpose 
anything 
in 
it, 
or 
to 
conceive 
in 
it 
any 
internal 
movement 
— 
any 
movement 
excited, 
directed, 
augmented 
or 
diminished 
within, 
such 
as 
may 
take 
place 
in 
compound 
bodies, 
where 
there 
is 
change 
of 
parts. 
The 
Monads 
have 
no 
windows 
through 
which 
anything 
can 
enter 
or 
go 
forth. 
It 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
any 
accidents 
to 
detach 
themselves 
and 
go 
forth 
from 
the 
substances, 
as 
did 
formerly 
the 
Sensible 
Species 
of 
the 
Schoolmen. 
Accordingly,neithersubstancenoraccident 
canenteraMonadfromwithout. 

8. 
Nevertheless 
Monads 
must 
have 
qualities 
— 
otherwise 
they 
would 
not 
even 
be 
entities; 
and 
if 
simple 
substances 
did 
not 
differ 
in 
their 
qualities, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
means 
by 
which 
we 
could 
become 
aware 
of 
the 
changes 
of 
things, 
since 
all 
that 
is 
in 
compound 
bodies 
is 
derived 
from 
simple 
ingredients, 
and 
Monads, 
being 
without 
qualities, 
would 
be 
indistinguishable 
one 
from 
another, 
seeing 
also 
they 
do 
not 
differ 
in 
quantity. 
Consequently, 
a 
plenum 
being 
supposed, 
each 
place 
could 
in 
any 
movement 
receive 
only 
the 
just 
equivalent 
of 
what 
it 
had 
had 
before, 
and 
one 
state 
of 
things 
would 
be 
indistinguishablefromanother. 
9. 
Moreover, 
each 
Monad 
must 
differ 
from 
every 
other, 
for 
there 
are 
never 
two 
beings 
in 
nature 
perfectly 
alike, 
and 
in 
which 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
find 
an 
internaldifference, 
orone 
founded 
onsomeintrinsicdenomination. 
10. 
I 
take 
it 
for 
granted, 
furthermore, 
that 
every 
created 
being 
is 
subject 
to 
change 
— 
consequently 
the 
created 
Monad; 
and 
likewise 
that 
this 
change 
is 
continualin 
each. 
11. 
It 
follows, 
from 
what 
we 
have 
now 
said, 
that 
the 
natural 
changes 
of 
Monads 
proceed 
from 
an 
internal 
principle, 
since 
no 
external 
cause 
can 
influencetheinterior. 
12. 
But, 
besides 
the 
principle 
of 
change, 
there 
must 
also 
be 
a 
detail 
of 
changes, 
embracing, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
specification 
and 
the 
variety 
of 
the 
simplesubstances. 
13. 
This 
detail 
must 
involve 
multitude 
in 
unity 
or 
in 
simplicity: 
for 
as 
all 
natural 
changes 
proceed 
by 
degrees, 
something 
changes 
and 
something 
remains, 
and 
consequently 
there 
must 
be 
in 
the 
simple 
substance 
a 
plurality 
ofaffectionsandrelations, 
althoughtherearenoparts. 
14. 
Thisshiftingstate,whichinvolves 
andrepresentsmultitudein 
unity,or 
in 
the 
simple 
substance, 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
what 
we 
call 
Perception, 
which 
must 
be 
carefully 
distinguished 
from 
apperception, 
or 
consciousness, 
as 
will 

appear 
in 
the 
sequel. 
Here 
it 
is 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
especially 
failed, 
making 
no 
account 
of 
those 
perceptions 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious. 
It 
is 
this 
that 
has 
led 
them 
to 
suppose 
that 
spirits 
are 
the 
only 
Monads, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
no 
souls 
of 
brutes 
or 
other 
Entelechies. 
It 
is 
owing 
to 
this 
that 
they 
have 
vulgarly 
confounded 
protracted 
torpor 
withactual 
death, 
and 
have 
fallen 
in 
with 
the 
scholastic 
prejudice, 
which 
believes 
in 
souls 
entirely 
separate. 
Hence, 
also, 
ill 
affected 
minds 
have 
been 
confirmed 
in 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
soul 
ismortal. 


15. 
The 
action 
of 
the 
internal 
principle 
which 
causes 
the 
change, 
or 
the 
passage 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another, 
may 
be 
called 
Appetition. 
It 
is 
true, 
the 
desire 
cannot 
always 
completely 
attain 
to 
every 
perception 
to 
which 
it 
tends, 
but 
it 
always 
attains 
to 
something 
thereof, 
and 
arrives 
at 
new 
perceptions. 
16. 
We 
experience 
in 
ourselves 
the 
fact 
of 
multitude 
in 
the 
simple 
substance, 
when 
we 
find 
that 
the 
least 
thought 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious 
includes 
a 
variety 
in 
its 
object. 
Accordingly, 
all 
who 
admit 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
simple 
substance, 
are 
bound 
to 
admit 
this 
multitude 
in 
the 
Monad, 
and 
Mr. 
Boyle 
should 
not 
have 
found 
any 
difficulty 
in 
this 
admission, 
as 
he 
has 
done 
inhisdictionary 
— 
Art. 
Rorarius. 
17. 
Besides, 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
Perception 
and 
its 
consequences 
are 
inexplicablebymechanicalcauses 
—thatistosay,by 
figuresand 
motions. 
If 
we 
imagine 
a 
machine 
so 
constructed 
as 
to 
produce 
thought, 
sensation, 
perception, 
we 
may 
conceive 
it 
magnified 
— 
the 
same 
proportions 
being 
preserved 
— 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
one 
might 
enter 
it 
like 
a 
mill. 
This 
being 
supposed, 
we 
should 
find 
in 
it 
on 
inspection 
only 
pieces 
which 
impel 
each 
other, 
but 
nothing 
which 
can 
explain 
a 
perception. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
simple 
substance,therefore 
— 
not 
inthecompound,orinmachinery 
— 
thatwemust 
look 
for 
that 
phenomenon; 
and 
in 
the 
simple 
substance 
we 
find 
nothing 
else 

— 
nothing, 
that 
is, 
but 
perceptions 
and 
their 
changes. 
Therein 
also, 
and 
thereinonly,consistalltheinternalactsof 
simplesubstances. 
18. 
We 
might 
give 
the 
name 
of 
Entelechies 
to 
all 
simple 
substances 
or 
created 
Monads, 
inasmuch 
as 
there 
is 
in 
them 
a 
certain 
completeness 
(perfection), 
(έχουσι 
τό 
έντελες). 
There 
is 
a 
sufficiency 
(αύτάρκεια) 
which 
makes 
them 
the 
sources 
of 
their 
own 
internal 
actions, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
incorporealautomata. 
19. 
If 
we 
choose 
to 
give 
the 
name 
of 
soul 
to 
all 
that 
has 
perceptions 
and 
desires, 
in 
the 
general 
sense 
which 
I 
have 
just 
indicated, 
all 
simple 
substances 
or 
created 
Monads 
may 
be 
called 
souls. 
But 
as 
sentiment 
is 
something 
more 
than 
simple 
perception, 
I 
am 
willing 
that 
the 
general 
name 
of 
Monads 
and 
Entelechies 
shall 
suffice 
for 
those 
simple 
substances 
which 
have 
nothing 
but 
perceptions, 
and 
that 
the 
term 
souls 
shall 
be 
confined 
to 
those 
whose 
perceptionsaremoredistinct,andaccompaniedby 
memory. 
20. 
For 
we 
experience 
in 
ourselves 
a 
state 
in 
which 
we 
remember 
nothing, 
and 
have 
no 
distinct 
perception, 
as 
when 
we 
are 
in 
a 
swoon 
or 
in 
a 
profound 
and 
dreamless 
sleep. 
In 
this 
state 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
differ 
sensibly 
from 
a 
simple 
Monad; 
but 
since 
this 
state 
is 
not 
permanent, 
and 
since 
the 
soul 
delivers 
herselffromit,sheissomethingmore. 
21. 
And 
it 
does 
not 
by 
any 
means 
follow, 
in 
that 
case, 
that 
the 
simple 
substance 
is 
without 
perception: 
that, 
indeed, 
is 
impossible, 
for 
the 
reasons 
given 
above; 
for 
it 
cannot 
perish, 
neither 
can 
it 
subsist 
without 
affection 
of 
some 
kind, 
which 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
its 
perception. 
But 
where 
there 
is 
a 
great 
number 
of 
minute 
perceptions, 
and 
where 
nothing 
is 
distinct, 
one 
is 
stunned, 
as 
when 
we 
turn 
round 
and 
round 
in 
continual 
succession 
in 
the 
same 
direction; 
whence 
arises 
a 
vertigo, 
which 
may 
cause 
us 
to 
faint, 
and 
which 
prevents 
us 
from 
distinguishing 
anything. 
And 
possibly 
death 
may 
producethis 
state 
for 
atime 
inanimals. 

22. 
And 
as 
every 
present 
condition 
of 
a 
simple 
substance 
is 
a 
natural 
consequenceofitsantecedentcondition,so 
itspresentisbigwith 
itsfuture. 
23. 
Then, 
as 
on 
awaking 
from 
a 
state 
of 
stupor, 
we 
become 
conscious 
of 
our 
perceptions, 
we 
must 
have 
had 
perceptions, 
although 
unconscious 
of 
them, 
immediately 
before 
awaking. 
For 
each 
perception 
can 
have 
no 
other 
natural 
origin 
but 
an 
antecedent 
perception, 
as 
every 
motion 
must 
be 
derived 
fromonewhichpreceded 
it. 
24. 
Thus 
it 
appears 
that 
if 
there 
were 
no 
distinction 
— 
no 
relief, 
so 
to 
speak 
— 
no 
enhanced 
flavor 
in 
our 
perceptions, 
we 
should 
continue 
forever 
inastateof 
stupor;and 
thisistheconditionofthenakedMonad. 
25. 
And 
so 
we 
see 
that 
nature 
has 
given 
to 
animals 
enhanced 
perceptions, 
by 
the 
care 
which 
she 
has 
taken 
to 
furnish 
them 
with 
organs 
which 
collect 
many 
rays 
of 
light 
and 
many 
undulations 
of 
air, 
increasing 
their 
efficacy 
by 
their 
union. 
There 
is 
something 
approaching 
to 
this 
in 
odor, 
in 
taste, 
in 
touch, 
and 
perhaps 
in 
a 
multitude 
of 
other 
senses 
of 
which 
we 
have 
no 
knowledge. 
I 
shall 
presently 
explain 
how 
that 
which 
passes 
in 
the 
soul 
represents 
that 
which 
takes 
placeintheorgans. 
26. 
Memory 
gives 
to 
the 
soul 
a 
kind 
of 
consecutive 
action 
which 
imitates 
reason, 
but 
must 
be 
distinguished 
from 
it. 
We 
observe 
that 
animals, 
having 
a 
perception 
of 
something 
which 
strikes 
them, 
and 
of 
which 
they 
have 
previously 
had 
a 
similar 
perception, 
expect, 
through 
the 
representation 
of 
their 
memory, 
the 
recurrence 
of 
that 
which 
was 
associated 
with 
it 
in 
their 
previous 
perception, 
and 
incline 
to 
the 
same 
feelings 
which 
they 
then 
had. 
For 
example, 
when 
we 
show 
dogs 
the 
cane, 
they 
remember 
the 
pain 
which 
it 
causedthem, 
andwhineand 
run. 
27. 
Andthelively 
imagination,whichstrikesand 
excites 
them,arisesfrom 
the 
magnitude 
or 
the 
multitude 
of 
their 
previous 
perceptions. 
For 
often 
a 

powerful 
impression 
produces 
suddenly 
the 
effect 
of 
long 
habit, 
or 
of 
moderateperceptionsoftenrepeated. 


28. 
In 
men 
as 
in 
brutes, 
the 
consecutiveness 
of 
their 
perceptions 
is 
due 
to 
theprinciple 
of 
memory 
— 
like 
empirics 
in 
medicine, 
who 
have 
only 
practice 
without 
theory. 
And 
we 
are 
mere 
empirics 
in 
three-fourths 
of 
our 
acts. 
For 
example, 
when 
we 
expect 
that 
the 
sun 
will 
rise 
tomorrow, 
we 
judge 
so 
empirically, 
because 
it 
has 
always 
risen 
hitherto. 
Only 
the 
astronomer 
judges 
byanactof 
reason. 
29. 
But 
the 
cognition 
of 
necessary 
and 
eternal 
truths 
is 
that 
which 
distinguishes 
us 
from 
mere 
animals. 
It 
is 
this 
which 
gives 
us 
Reason 
and 
Science, 
and 
raises 
us 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
ourselves 
and 
of 
God: 
and 
it 
is 
this 
inuswhichwecalla 
reasonablesoulorspirit. 
30. 
It 
is 
also 
by 
the 
cognition 
of 
necessary 
truths, 
and 
by 
theirabstractions, 
that 
we 
rise 
to 
acts 
of 
reflection, 
which 
give 
us 
the 
idea 
of 
that 
which, 
calls 
itself 
“I,” 
and 
which 
lead 
us 
to 
consider 
that 
this 
or 
that 
is 
in 
us. 
And 
thus, 
while 
thinking 
of 
ourselves, 
we 
think 
of 
Being, 
of 
substance, 
simple 
or 
compound, 
of 
the 
immaterial, 
and 
of 
God 
himself. 
We 
conceive 
that 
that 
which 
in 
us 
is 
limited, 
is 
in 
him 
without 
limit. 
And 
these 
reflective 
acts 
furnishtheprincipalobjects 
ofourreasonings. 
31. 
Our 
reasonings 
are 
founded 
on 
two 
great 
principles, 
that 
of 
“Contradiction,” 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
we 
judge 
that 
to 
be 
false 
which 
involves 
contradiction, 
and 
that 
to 
be 
true 
which 
is 
opposed 
to, 
or 
which 
contradicts 
thefalse. 
32. 
And 
that 
of 
the 
“Sufficient 
Reason,” 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
we 
judge 
that 
no 
fact 
can 
be 
real 
or 
existent, 
no 
statement 
true, 
unless 
there 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
why 
it 
is 
thus, 
and 
not 
otherwise, 
although 
these 
reasons 
very 
often 
cannotbe 
knowntous. 

33. 
There 
are 
also 
two 
sorts 
of 
truths 
— 
those 
of 
reasoning 
and 
those 
of 
fact. 
Truths 
of 
reasoning 
are 
necessary, 
and 
their 
opposite 
is 
impossible; 
those 
of 
fact 
are 
contingent, 
and 
their 
opposite 
is 
possible. 
When 
a 
truth 
is 
necessary, 
we 
may 
discover 
the 
reason 
of 
it 
by 
analysis, 
resolving 
it 
into 
simpler 
ideas 
and 
truths, 
until 
we 
arrive 
at 
those 
which 
are 
ultimate 
[Primitifs]. 
34. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
mathematicians 
by 
analysis 
reduce 
speculative 
theorems 
and 
practicalcanonsto 
definitions, 
axioms 
andpostulates. 
35. 
Andfinally, 
there 
aresimple 
ideas 
ofwhich 
nodefinitioncan 
begiven; 
there 
are 
also 
axioms 
and 
postulates, 
— 
in 
one 
word, 
ultimate 
[Primitifs] 
principles, 
which 
cannot 
and 
need 
not 
be 
proved. 
And 
these 
are 
“Identical 
Propositions,” 
ofwhich 
the 
oppositecontainsanexpresscontradiction. 
36. 
But 
there 
must 
also 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
truths 
contingent, 
or 
truths 
of 
fact 
— 
that 
is, 
for 
the 
series 
of 
things 
diffused 
through 
the 
universe 
of 
creatures 
— 
or 
else 
the 
process 
of 
resolving 
into 
particular 
reasons 
might 
run 
into 
a 
detail 
without 
bounds, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
immense 
variety 
of 
the 
things 
of 
nature, 
and 
of 
the 
infinite 
division 
of 
bodies. 
There 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
figures 
and 
of 
movements, 
present 
and 
past, 
which 
enter 
into 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
my 
present 
writing; 
and 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
minute 
inclinations 
and 
dispositions 
of 
my 
soul, 
present 
and 
past, 
which 
enter 
into 
the 
final 
cause 
ofit. 
37. 
And 
as 
all 
this 
detail 
only 
involves 
other 
anterior 
or 
more 
detailed 
contingencies, 
each 
one 
of 
which 
again 
requires 
a 
similar 
analysis 
in 
order 
to 
account 
for 
it, 
we 
have 
made 
no 
advance, 
and 
the 
sufficient 
or 
final 
reason 
must 
be 
outside 
of 
the 
series 
of 
this 
detail 
of 
contingencies 
[i.e. 
accidental 
causes],endlessas 
itmay 
be. 
38. 
And 
thus 
the 
final 
reason 
of 
things 
must 
be 
found 
in 
a 
necessary 
Substance, 
in 
which 
the 
detail 
of 
changes 
exists 
eminently 
as 
their 
source. 

Andthisis 
thatwhichwecallGod. 


39. 
Now 
this 
Substance 
being 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
of 
all 
this 
detail, 
which 
also 
is 
everywhere 
linked 
together, 
there 
is 
but 
one 
God, 
and 
this 
God 
suffices. 
40. 
We 
may 
also 
conclude 
that 
this 
supreme 
Substance, 
which 
is 
Only 
[unique], 
Universal, 
and 
Necessary 
— 
having 
nothing 
outside 
of 
it 
which 
is 
independent 
of 
it, 
and 
being 
a 
simple 
series 
of 
possible 
beings 
— 
must 
be 
incapableoflimits,andmustcontainas 
muchofrealityasispossible. 
41. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
God 
is 
perfect, 
perfection 
being 
nothing 
but 
the 
magnitude 
of 
positive 
reality 
taken 
exactly, 
setting 
aside 
the 
limits 
or 
bounds 
in 
that 
which 
is 
limited. 
And 
there, 
where 
there 
are 
no 
bounds, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
inGod,perfectionisabsolutelyinfinite. 
42. 
It 
follows 
also 
that 
the 
creatures 
have 
their 
perfections 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
God, 
but 
they 
have 
their 
imperfections 
from 
their 
proper 
nature, 
incapable 
of 
existing 
without 
bounds; 
for 
it 
is 
by 
this 
that 
they 
are 
distinguished 
fromGod. 
43. 
It 
is 
true, 
moreover, 
that 
God 
is 
not 
only 
the 
source 
of 
existences, 
but 
also 
of 
essences, 
so 
far 
as 
real, 
or 
of 
that 
which 
is 
real 
in 
the 
possible; 
because 
the 
divine 
understanding 
is 
the 
region 
of 
eternal 
truths, 
or 
of 
the 
ideas 
on 
which 
they 
depend, 
and 
without 
Him 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
real 
in 
thepossibilities,andnotonlynothingexisting, 
butalsonothingpossible. 
44. 
At 
the 
same 
time,if 
therebe 
areality 
intheessences 
orpossibilities,or 
in 
the 
eternal 
truths, 
this 
reality 
must 
be 
founded 
in 
something 
existing 
and 
actual, 
consequently 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
necessary 
Being, 
in 
whom 
essence 
includes 
existence, 
or 
with 
whom 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
be 
possible 
in 
ordertobe 
actual. 
45. 
Thus 
God 
alone 
(or 
the 
necessary 
Being) 
possesses 
this 
privilege, 
that 
he 
must 
exist 
if 
possible; 
and 
since 
nothing 
can 
hinder 
the 
possibility 
of 
that 

which 
includes 
no 
bounds, 
no 
negation, 
and 
consequently 
no 
contradiction, 
that 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
to 
establish 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
a 
priori. 
We 
have 
likewise 
proved 
it 
by 
the 
reality 
of 
eternal 
truths. 
But 
we 
have 
also 
just 
provedit 
a 
posteriori 
by 
showing 
that, 
since 
contingent 
beings 
exist, 
they 
can 
have 
their 
ultimate 
and 
sufficient 
reason 
only 
in 
some 
necessary 
Being, 
who 
contains 
the 
reasonofhisexistenceinhimself. 


46. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
must 
not 
suppose, 
with 
some, 
that 
eternal 
verities, 
being 
dependent 
upon 
God, 
are 
arbitrary, 
and 
depend 
upon 
his 
will, 
as 
Des 
Cartes, 
and 
afterward 
M. 
Poiret, 
appear 
to 
have 
conceived. 
This 
is 
true 
only 
of 
contingent 
truths, 
the 
principle 
of 
which 
is 
fitness, 
or 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
best; 
whereas 
necessary 
truths 
depend 
solely 
on 
His 
understanding, 
and 
are 
itsinternalobject. 
47. 
Thus 
God 
alone 
is 
theprimitive 
Unity, 
or 
the 
simple 
originalsubstance 
of 
which 
all 
the 
created 
or 
derived 
Monads 
are 
the 
products; 
and 
they 
are 
generated, 
so 
to 
speak, 
by 
continual 
fulgurations 
of 
the 
Divinity, 
from 
moment 
to 
moment, 
bounded 
by 
the 
receptivity 
of 
the 
creature, 
of 
whose 
existencelimitationis 
anessentialcondition. 
48. 
In 
God 
is 
Power, 
which 
is 
the 
source 
of 
all; 
then 
Knowledge, 
which 
contains 
the 
detail 
of 
Ideas; 
and, 
finally, 
Will, 
which 
generates 
changes 
or 
products 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
optimism. 
And 
this 
answers 
to 
what, 
in 
created 
Monads, 
constitutes 
the 
subject 
or 
the 
basis, 
the 
perceptive 
and 
the 
appetitive 
faculty. 
But 
in 
God 
these 
attributes 
are 
absolutely 
infinite 
or 
perfect, 
and 
in 
the 
created 
Monads, 
or 
in 
the 
Entelechies 
(or 
perfectihabiis,as 
Hermolaus 
Barbaras 
translates 
this 
word), 
they 
are 
only 
imitations 
according 
tothemeasureoftheirperfection. 
49. 
The 
creature 
is 
said 
to 
act 
externally, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
possesses 
perfection, 
and 
to 
suffer 
from 
‘another 
(creature) 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
imperfect. 
So 

we 
ascribe 
action 
to 
the 
Monad, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
has 
distinct 
perceptions, 
and 
passion,sofar 
asitsperceptions 
areconfused. 


50. 
Andone 
creatureis 
moreperfectthananother,inthis:thatwe 
findin 
it 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
account 
a 
priori 
for 
what 
passes 
in 
the 
other; 
and 
it 
is 
thereforesaid 
toactupontheother. 
51. 
But 
in 
simple 
substances 
this 
is 
merely 
an 
ideal 
influence 
of 
one 
Monad 
upon 
another, 
which 
can 
pass 
into 
effect 
only 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
God, 
inasmuch 
as 
in 
the 
ideas 
of 
God 
one 
Monad 
has 
a 
right 
to 
demand 
that 
God, 
in 
regulating 
the 
rest 
from 
the 
commencement 
of 
things, 
shall 
have 
regard 
to 
it; 
for 
since 
a 
created 
Monad 
can 
have 
no 
physical 
influence 
on 
the 
interior 
of 
another, 
it 
is 
only 
by 
this 
means 
that 
one 
can 
be 
dependent 
on 
another. 
52. 
And 
hence 
it 
is 
that 
actions 
and 
passions 
in 
creatures 
are 
mutual; 
for 
God, 
comparing 
two 
simple 
substances, 
finds 
reasons 
in 
each 
which 
oblige 
him 
to 
accommodate 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other. 
Consequently 
that 
which 
is 
active 
in 
one 
view, 
is 
passive 
in 
another 
— 
active 
so 
far 
as 
what 
we 
clearly 
discern 
in 
it 
serves 
to 
account 
forthatwhichtakes 
place 
in 
another,andpassive 
so 
far 
as 
the 
reason 
of 
that 
which 
passes 
in 
it 
is 
found 
in 
that 
which 
is 
clearly 
discernedinanother. 
53. 
Now, 
as 
in 
the 
ideas 
of 
God 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
possible 
worlds, 
and 
as 
only 
one 
can 
exist, 
there 
must 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
the 
choice 
of 
God, 
which 
determineshim 
tooneratherthan 
another. 
54. 
And 
this 
reason 
can 
be 
no 
other 
than 
fitness, 
derived 
from 
the 
different 
degrees 
of 
perfection 
which 
these 
worlds 
contain, 
each 
possible 
world 
having 
a 
claimtoexistaccordingtothemeasureofperfectionwhichitenfolds. 
55. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
that 
Best, 
which 
the 
wisdom 
ofGoddiscerns,whichhisgoodnesschooses,andhispowereffects. 

56. 
And 
this 
connection, 
or 
this 
accommodation 
of 
all 
created 
thin-M5h, 
and 
of 
each 
to 
all, 
implies 
in 
each 
simple 
substance 
relations 
which 
express 
all 
the 
rest. 
Each, 
accordingly, 
is 
a 
living 
and 
perpetual 
mirror 
of 
the 
universe. 
57. 
And 
as 
the 
same 
city 
viewed 
from 
different 
sides 
appears 
quite 
different, 
and 
is 
perspectively 
multiplied, 
so, 
in 
the 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
simplesubstances,therearegiven,as 
itwere,somany 
differentworldswhich 
yet 
are 
only 
the 
perspectives 
of 
a 
single 
one, 
according 
to 
the 
different 
points 
ofviewofeachMonad. 
58. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
way 
to 
obtain 
the 
greatest 
possible 
variety 
with 
the 
greatest 
possible 
order 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
way 
to 
obtain 
the 
greatest 
possibleperfection. 
59. 
Thus 
thishypothesis(whichImay 
venture 
topronouncedemonstrated) 
is 
the 
only 
one 
which 
properly 
exhibits 
the 
greatness 
of 
God. 
And 
this 
Mr. 
Boyle 
acknowledges, 
when 
in 
his 
dictionary 
(Art. 
Rorarius) 
he 
objects 
to 
it. 
He 
is 
even 
disposed 
to 
think 
that 
I 
attribute 
too 
much 
to 
God, 
that 
I 
ascribe 
to 
him 
impossibilities; 
but 
he 
can 
allege 
no 
reason 
for 
the 
impossibility 
of 
this 
universal 
harmony, 
by 
which 
each 
substance 
expresses 
exactly 
the 
perfectionsof 
allthe 
restthroughitsrelationswiththem. 
60. 
We 
see, 
moreover, 
in 
that 
which 
I 
have 
just 
stated, 
the 
a 
priori 
reasons 
why 
things 
could 
not 
be 
other 
than 
they 
are. 
God, 
in 
ordering 
the 
whole, 
has 
respect 
to 
each 
part, 
and 
specifically 
to 
each 
Monad, 
whose 
nature 
being 
representative, 
is 
by 
nothing 
restrained 
from 
representing 
the 
whole 
of 
things, 
although, 
it 
is 
true, 
this 
representation 
must 
needs 
be 
confused, 
as 
it 
regards 
the 
detail 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
can 
be 
distinct 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
small 
part 
of 
things, 
that 
is, 
in 
relation 
to 
those 
which 
are 
nearest, 
or 
whose 
relations 
to 
any 
given 
Monad 
are 
greatest. 
Otherwise 
each 
Monad 
would 
be 
a 
divinity. 
The 
Monads 
are 
limited, 
not 
in 
the 
object, 
but 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
their 
knowledge 

of 
the 
object. 
They 
all 
tend 
confusedly 
to 
the 
infinite, 
to 
the 
whole; 
but 
they 
are 
limited 
and 
distinguished 
by 
the 
degrees 
of 
distinctness 
in 
their 
perceptions. 


61. 
And 
compounds 
symbolize 
in 
this 
with 
simples. 
For 
since 
the 
world 
is 
a 
plenum, 
and 
all 
matter 
connected, 
and 
as 
in 
a 
plenum 
every 
movement 
has 
some 
effect 
on 
distant 
bodies, 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
distance, 
so 
that 
each 
body 
is 
affected 
not 
only 
by 
those 
in 
actual 
contact 
with 
it, 
and 
feels 
in 
some 
way 
all 
that 
happens 
to 
them, 
but 
also 
through 
their 
means 
is 
affected 
by 
others 
in 
contact 
with 
those 
by 
which 
it 
is 
immediately 
touched 
— 
it 
follows 
that 
this 
communication 
extends 
to 
any 
distance. 
Consequently, 
each 
body 
feels 
all 
that 
passes 
in 
the 
universe, 
so 
that 
he 
who 
sees 
all, 
may 
read 
in 
each 
that 
which 
passes 
everywhere 
else, 
and 
even 
that 
which 
has 
been 
and 
shall 
be, 
discerning 
in 
the 
present 
that 
which 
is 
removed 
in 
time 
as 
well 
as 
in 
space. 
“Συμπνόιει 
Πάντα,” 
says 
Hippocrates. 
But 
each 
soul 
can 
read 
in 
itself 
only 
that 
which 
is 
distinctly 
represented 
in 
it. 
It 
cannot 
unfold 
its 
laws 
at 
once,fortheyreach 
intotheinfinite. 
62. 
Thus, 
though 
every 
created 
Monad 
represents 
the 
entire 
universe, 
it 
represents 
more 
distinctly 
the 
particular 
body 
to 
which 
it 
belongs, 
and 
whose 
Entelechy 
it 
is: 
and 
as 
this 
body 
expresses 
the 
entire 
universe, 
through 
the 
connection 
of 
all 
matter 
in 
a 
plenum, 
the 
soul 
represents 
also 
the 
entire 
universe 
inrepresentingthatbody 
whichespeciallybelongstoit. 
63. 
The 
body 
belonging 
to 
a 
Monad, 
which 
is 
its 
Entelechy 
or 
soul, 
constitutes, 
with 
its 
Entelechy, 
what 
may 
be 
termed 
a 
living 
(thing), 
and, 
with 
its 
soul, 
what 
may 
be 
called 
an 
animal. 
And 
the 
body 
of 
a 
living 
being, 
or 
of 
an 
animal, 
is 
always 
organic; 
for 
every 
Monad, 
being 
a 
mirror 
of 
the 
universe, 
according 
to 
its 
fashion, 
and 
the 
universe 
being 
arranged 
with 
perfect 
order, 
there 
must 
be 
the 
same 
order 
in 
the 
representative 
— 
that 
is, 
in 

the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
consequently 
of 
the 
body 
according 
to 
which 
theuniverseisrepresentedin 
it. 


64. 
Thus 
each 
organic 
living 
body 
is 
a 
species 
of 
divine 
machine, 
or 
a 
natural 
automaton, 
infinitely 
surpassing 
all 
artificial 
automata. 
A 
machine 
made 
by 
human 
art 
is 
not 
a 
machine 
in 
all 
its 
parts. 
For 
example, 
the 
tooth 
of 
a 
brass 
wheel 
has 
parts 
or 
fragments 
which 
are 
not 
artificial 
to 
us; 
they 
have 
nothing 
which 
marks 
the 
machine 
in 
their 
relation 
to 
the 
use 
for 
which 
the 
wheel 
is 
designed; 
but 
natural 
machines 
— 
that 
is, 
living 
bodies 
— 
are 
still 
machines 
in 
their 
minutest 
parts, 
ad 
infinitum. 
This 
makes 
the 
difference 
between 
natureand 
art,that 
istosay, 
betweentheDivineartandours. 
65. 
And 
the 
author 
of 
nature 
was 
able 
to 
exercise 
this 
divine 
and 
infinitely 
wonderful 
art, 
inasmuch 
as 
every 
portion 
of 
nature 
is 
not 
only 
infinitely 
divisible, 
as 
the 
ancients 
knew, 
but 
is 
actually 
subdivided 
without 
end 
— 
each 
part 
into 
parts, 
of 
which 
each 
has 
its 
own 
movement. 
Otherwise, 
it 
would 
beimpossible 
thateachportionofmattershould 
express 
the 
universe. 
66. 
Whence 
it 
appears 
that 
there 
is 
a 
world 
of 
creatures, 
of 
living 
(things), 
ofanimals,ofEntelechies,ofsouls,intheminutestportionofmatter. 
67. 
Every 
particle 
of 
matter 
may 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
garden 
of 
plants, 
or 
as 
a 
pond 
full 
of 
fishes. 
But 
each 
branch 
of 
each 
plant, 
each 
member 
of 
each 
animal,each 
dropoftheirhumors,isinturnanothersuch 
gardenorpond. 
68. 
And 
although 
the 
earth 
and 
the 
air 
embraced 
between 
the 
plants 
in 
the 
garden, 
or 
the 
water 
between 
the 
fishes 
of 
the 
pond, 
are 
not 
themselves 
plant 
or 
fish, 
they 
nevertheless 
contain 
such, 
but 
mostly 
too 
minute 
for 
our 
perception. 
69. 
So 
there 
is 
no 
uncultured 
spot, 
no 
barrenness, 
no 
death 
in 
the 
universe 
— 
no 
chaos, 
no 
confusion, 
except 
in 
appearance, 
as 
it 
might 
seem 
in 
a 
pond 
at 
a 
distance, 
in 
which 
one 
should 
see 
a 
confused 
motion 
and 
swarming, 
so 
to 
speak,ofthefishesofthepond,withoutdistinguishingthefishesthemselves. 

70. 
We 
see, 
then, 
that 
each 
living 
body 
has 
a 
governing 
Entelechy, 
which 
in 
animals 
is 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
animal. 
But 
the 
members 
of 
this 
living 
body 
are 
full 
of 
other 
living 
bodies 
— 
plants, 
animals 
— 
each 
of 
which 
has 
its 
Entelechy,orregentsoul. 
71. 
We 
must 
not, 
however, 
suppose 
— 
as 
some 
who 
misapprehended 
my 
thought 
have 
done 
— 
that 
each 
soul 
has 
a 
mass 
or 
portion 
of 
matter 
proper 
to 
itself, 
or 
forever 
united 
to 
it, 
and 
that 
it 
consequently 
possesses 
other 
inferior 
living 
existences, 
destined 
forever 
to 
its 
service. 
For 
all 
bodies 
are 
in 
a 
perpetualflux,likerivers. 
Theirparticles 
arecontinually 
coming 
andgoing. 
72. 
Thus 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
change 
its 
body 
except 
by 
degrees. 
It 
is 
never 
deprived 
at 
once 
of 
all 
its 
organs. 
There 
are 
often 
metamorphoses 
in 
animals, 
but 
never 
Metempsychosis 
— 
no 
transmigration 
of 
souls. 
Neither 
are 
there 
souls 
entirely 
separated 
(from 
bodies), 
nor 
genii 
without 
bodies. 
God 
alone 
is 
whollywithoutbody. 
73. 
For 
which 
reason, 
also, 
there 
is 
never 
complete 
generation 
nor 
perfect 
death 
— 
strictly 
considered 
— 
consisting 
in 
the 
separation 
of 
the 
soul. 
That 
which 
we 
call 
generation, 
is 
development 
and 
accretion; 
and 
that 
which 
we 
call 
death, 
isenvelopmentand 
diminution. 
74. 
Philosophers 
have 
been 
much 
troubled 
about 
the 
origin 
of 
forms, 
of 
Entelechies, 
or 
souls. 
But 
at 
the 
present 
day, 
when, 
by 
accurate 
investigations 
of 
plants, 
insects 
and 
animals, 
they 
have 
become 
aware 
that 
the 
organic 
bodies 
of 
nature 
are 
never 
produced 
from 
chaos 
or 
from 
putrefaction, 
but 
always 
from 
seed, 
in 
which 
undoubtedly 
there 
had 
been 
a 
preformation; 
it 
has 
been 
inferred 
that 
not 
only 
the 
organic 
body 
existed 
in 
that 
seed 
before 
conception, 
but 
also 
a 
soul 
in 
that 
body 
— 
in 
one 
word, 
the 
animal 
itself 
— 
and 
that, 
by 
the 
act 
of 
conception, 
this 
animal 
is 
merely 
disposed 
to 
a 
grand 
transformation, 
to 
become 
an 
animal 
of 
another 
species. 
We 
even 
see 

something 
approaching 
this, 
outside 
of 
generation, 
as 
when 
worms 
become 
flies, 
orwhencaterpillarsbecomebutterflies. 


75. 
Those 
animals, 
of 
which 
some 
are 
advanced 
to 
a 
higher 
grade, 
by 
means 
of 
conception, 
may 
be 
called 
spermatic; 
but 
those 
among 
them 
which 
remain 
in 
their 
kind 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
greater 
portion 
— 
are 
born, 
multiply, 
and 
are 
destroyed, 
like 
the 
larger 
animals, 
and 
only 
a 
small 
number 
oftheelectamong 
them,passtoa 
grandertheatre. 
76. 
But 
this 
is 
only 
half 
the 
truth. 
I 
have 
concluded 
that 
if 
the 
animal 
does 
not 
begin 
to 
be 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
it 
also 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
be 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
and 
that 
not 
only 
there 
is 
no 
generation, 
but 
no 
entire 
destruction 
— 
no 
death, 
strictly 
considered. 
And 
these 
a 
posteriori 
conclusions, 
drawn 
from 
experience, 
accord 
perfectly 
with 
my 
principles 
deduced 
a 
priori, 
as 
stated 
above. 
77. 
Thus 
we 
may 
Bay, 
not 
only 
that 
the 
soul 
(mirror 
of 
an 
indestructible 
universe) 
is 
indestructible, 
but 
also 
the 
animal 
itself, 
although 
its 
machine 
mayoftenperishinpart,andputofforputonorganicspoils. 
78. 
These 
principles 
have 
furnished 
me 
with 
a 
natural 
explanation 
of 
the 
union, 
or 
rather 
the 
conformity 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
organized 
body. 
The 
soul 
follows 
its 
proper 
laws, 
and 
the 
body 
likewise 
follows 
those 
which 
are 
proper 
to 
it, 
and 
they 
meet 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
preëstablished 
harmony 
which 
exists 
between 
all 
substances, 
as 
representations 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
universe. 
79. 
Souls 
act 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
final 
causes, 
by 
appetitions, 
means 
and 
ends; 
bodies 
act 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
or 
the 
laws 
of 
motion. 
And 
the 
two 
kingdoms, 
that 
of 
efficient 
causes 
and 
that 
of 
final 
causes, 
harmonizewith 
each 
other. 
80. 
Des 
Cartes 
perceived 
that 
souls 
communicate 
no 
force 
to 
bodies, 
because 
the 
quantity 
of 
force 
in 
matter 
is 
always 
the 
same. 
Nevertheless, 
he 

believedthatsoulsmightchangethedirectionof 
bodies. 
Butthiswasbecause 
the 
world 
was 
at 
that 
time 
ignorant 
of 
the 
law 
of 
nature, 
which 
requires 
the 
conservation 
of 
the 
same 
total 
direction 
in 
matter. 
Had 
he 
known 
this, 
he 
would 
havehituponmysystemofpreëstablishedharmony. 


81. 
According 
to 
this 
system, 
bodies 
act 
as 
if 
there 
were 
no 
souls, 
and 
souls 
act 
as 
if 
there 
were 
no 
bodies; 
and 
yet 
both 
act 
as 
though 
the 
one 
influenced 
theother. 
82. 
As 
to 
spirits, 
or 
rational 
souls, 
although 
I 
find 
that 
at 
bottom 
the 
same 
principle 
which 
I 
have 
stated 
— 
namely, 
that 
animals 
and 
souls 
begin 
with 
theworldand 
end 
only 
withthe 
world 
—holds 
with 
regardtoall 
animals 
and 
living 
things, 
yet 
there 
is 
this 
peculiarity 
in 
rational 
animals, 
that 
although 
their 
spermatic 
animalcules, 
as 
such, 
have 
only 
ordinary 
or 
sensitive 
souls, 
yet 
as 
soon 
as 
those 
of 
them 
which 
are 
elected, 
so 
to 
speak, 
arrive 
by 
the 
act 
of 
conception 
at 
human 
nature, 
their 
sensitive 
souls 
are 
elevated 
to 
the 
rank 
ofreasonandtotheprerogativeofspirits. 
83. 
Among 
other 
differences 
which 
distinguish 
spirits 
fromordinary 
souls, 
some 
of 
which 
have 
already 
been 
indicated, 
there 
is 
also 
this: 
that 
souls 
in 
general 
are 
living 
mirrors, 
or 
images 
of 
the 
universe 
of 
creatures, 
but 
spirits 
are, 
furthermore, 
images 
of 
Divinity 
itself, 
or 
of 
the 
Author 
of 
Nature, 
capable 
of 
cognizing 
the 
system 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
of 
imitating 
something 
of 
it 
by 
architectonic 
experiments, 
each 
spirit 
being, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
little 
divinityinits 
owndepartment. 
84. 
Hence 
spirits 
are 
able 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
kind 
of 
fellowship 
with 
God. 
In 
their 
view 
he 
is 
not 
merely 
what 
an 
inventor 
is 
to 
his 
machine 
(as 
God 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
other 
creatures), 
but 
also 
what 
a 
prince 
is 
to 
his 
subjects, 
and 
even 
whatafatheristohischildren. 
85. 
Whence 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
conclude 
that 
the 
assembly 
of 
all 
spirits 
must 
constitute 
the 
City 
of 
God 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
most 
perfect 
state 
possible, 

underthe 
mostperfectofmonarchs. 


86. 
This 
City 
of 
God, 
this 
truly 
universal 
monarchy, 
is 
a 
moral 
world 
within 
the 
natural; 
and 
it 
is 
the 
most 
exalted 
and 
the 
most 
divine 
among 
the 
works 
of 
God. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
that 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
most 
truly 
consists, 
which 
glory 
would 
be 
wanting 
if 
his 
greatness 
and 
his 
goodness 
were 
not 
recognized 
and 
admired 
by 
spirits. 
It 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
this 
Divine 
City 
that 
he 
possesses, 
properly 
speaking, 
the 
attribute 
of 
goodness, 
whereas 
his 
wisdom 
and 
hispowerareeverywheremanifest. 
87. 
As 
we 
have 
established 
above, 
a 
perfect 
harmony 
between 
the 
two 
natural 
kingdoms 
— 
the 
one 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
the 
other 
of 
final 
causes 
— 
so 
it 
behooves 
us 
to 
notice 
here 
also 
a 
still 
further 
harmony 
between 
the 
physical 
kingdom 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
moral 
kingdom 
of 
grace 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
between 
God 
considered 
as 
the 
architect 
of 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
Godconsideredasmonarchofthedivine 
CityofSpirits. 
88. 
This 
harmony 
makes 
all 
things 
conduce 
to 
grace 
by 
natural 
methods. 
This 
globe, 
for 
example, 
must 
be 
destroyed 
and 
repaired 
by 
natural 
means, 
at 
suchseasonsasthe 
governmentofspiritsmayrequire,forthechastisementof 
someand 
the 
recompense 
ofothers. 
89. 
We 
may 
say, 
furthermore, 
that 
God 
as 
architect 
contains 
entirely 
God 
as 
legislator, 
and 
that 
accordingly 
sins 
must 
carry 
their 
punishment 
with 
them 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
by 
virtue 
even 
of 
the 
mechanical 
structure 
of 
things, 
and 
that 
good 
deeds 
in 
like 
manner 
will 
bring 
their 
recompense, 
through 
their 
connection 
with 
bodies, 
although 
this 
cannot, 
and 
ought 
not 
always 
to, 
take 
placeonthespot. 
90. 
Finally, 
under 
this 
perfect 
government, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
good 
deed 
withoutits 
recompense, 
andno 
evil 
deed 
withoutits 
punishment, 
andall 
must 
redound 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
good 
— 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
those 
who 
are 
not 
malcontents 
— 
in 
this 
great 
commonwealth, 
who 
confide 
in 
Providence 
after 

having 
done 
their 
duty, 
and 
who 
worthily 
love 
and 
imitate 
the 
Author 
of 
all 
good, 
pleasing 
themselves 
with 
the 
contemplation 
of 
his 
perfections, 
following 
the 
nature 
of 
pure 
and 
genuine 
Love, 
which 
makes 
us 
blest 
in 
the 
happiness 
of 
the 
loved. 
In 
this 
spirit, 
the 
wise 
and 
good 
labor 
for 
that 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
conformed 
to 
the 
divine 
will, 
presumptive 
or 
antecedent, 
contented 
the 
while 
with 
nil 
that 
God 
brings 
to 
pass 
by 
his 
secret 
will, 
consequent 
and 
decisive, 
— 
knowing 
that 
if 
we 
were 
sufficiently 
acquainted 
with 
the 
order 
of 
the 
universe 
we 
should 
find 
that 
it 
surpasses 
all 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
wisest, 
and 
that 
it 
could 
not 
be 
made 
better 
than 
it 
is, 
not 
only 
for 
all 
in 
general, 
but 
for 
ourselves 
in 
particular, 
if 
we 
arc 
attached, 
as 
is 
fitting, 
to 
the 
Author 
of 
All, 
not 
only 
as 
the 
architect 
and 
efficient 
cause 
of 
our 
being, 
but 
also 
as 
our 
master 
and 
the 
final 
cause, 
who 
should 
be 
the 
whole 
aim 
of 
our 
volition,andwhoalonecanmakeusblest.

ask 
my 
opinion, 
I 
do 
not 
hesitatetosayabsolutelythatitleadstoatheism. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
there 
are 
some 
things 
very 
suspicious 
to 
me 
who 
have 
considered 
it 
attentively: 
for 
example, 
these 
two 
passages, 
that 
final 
cause 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
physics, 
and 
that 
matter 
takes 
successively 
all 
the 
forms 
of 
which 
it 
is 
capable. 
There 
is 
an 
admirable 
passage 
in 
the 
Phaedo 
of 
Plato 
which 
justly 
blames 
Anaxagoras 
for 
the 
very 
thing 
which 
displeases 
mein 
Descartes. 
For 
myself, 
Ibelieve 
that 
thelaws 
of 
mechanics 
which 
serve 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
whole 
system 
depend 
on 
final 
causes; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
on 
the 
will 
of 
God 
determined 
to 
make 
what 
is 
most 
perfect, 
and 
that 
matter 
does 
not 
take 
all 
possible 
forms 
but 
only 
the 
most 
perfect; 
otherwise 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
say 
that 
there 
will 
be 
a 
time 
when 
all 
will 
be 
evil 
in 
turn, 
which 
is 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
author 
of 
things. 
As 
for 
the 
rest, 
if 
Descartes 
had 
been 
less 
given 
to 
imaginary 
hypotheses 
and 
if 
he 
had 
been 
more 
attached 
to 
experiments, 
I 
think 
that 
his 
physics 
would 
have 
been 
worthy 
of 
being 
followed. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
he 
had 
great 
penetration. 
As 
for 
his 
geometry 
and 
analysis 
they 
are 
far 
from 
being 
as 
perfect 
as 
those 
pretend 
who 
are 
given 
but 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
minor 
problems. 
There 
are 
several 
errors 
in 
his 
metaphysics, 
and 
he 
has 
not 
known 
the 
true 
source 
of 
truths 
nor 
that 
general 
analysis 
of 
notions 
which 
Jung, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
has 
better 
understood 
than 
he. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
confess 
that 
the 
reading 
of 
Descartes 
is 
very 
useful 
and 
very 
instructive, 
and 
that 
I 
like 
incomparably 
more 
to 
have 
to 
do 
with 
a 
Cartesian 
than 
with 
a 
man 
from 



some 
other 
school. 
Finally, 
I 
consider 
this 
philosophy 
as 
the 
ante-chamber 
of 
thetruephilosophy. 
— 
Extract 
from 
a 
letter 
to 
Philipp, 
1679. 


I 
esteem 
Descartes 
almost 
as 
highly 
as 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
esteem 
a 
man, 
and 
although 
there 
are 
among 
his 
opinions 
some 
which 
appear 
to 
me 
false 
and 
even 
dangerous, 
I 
do 
not 
hesitate 
to 
say 
that 
we 
owe 
almost 
as 
much 
to 
Galileo 
and 
to 
him 
in 
matters 
of 
philosophy 
as 
to 
all 
antiquity. 
I 
remember 
at 
present 
but 
one 
of 
the 
two 
dangerous 
propositions 
of 
which 
you 
wish 
me 
to 
indicate 
the 
place, 
viz: 
Principiorum 
Philosophicorum 
Part. 
3, 
Artieulo 
47, 
his 
verbis: 
“Atque 
omnino 
parum 
refert, 
quid 
hoc 
pacto 
supponatur, 
quia 
postea 
justa 
leges 
naturae 
est 
mutandum. 
Et 
vix 
aiiquid 
supponi 
potest 
ex 
quo 
non 
idem 
effectus, 
quanquam 
fortasse 
operosius, 
deduci 
possit. 
Cum 
enim 
illarum 
ope 
materia 
formas 
omnes 
quarum 
est 
capax 
successive 
assumat, 
si 
formas 
istas 
ordine 
considérerons, 
tandem 
ad 
illam 
quae 
est 
hujus 
mundi 
poterimusdevenire, 
adeouthicnihilerroris 
exfalsahypothesisittimendum.” 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
form 
a 
more 
dangerous 
proposition 
than 
this. 
For 
if 
matter 
receive 
successively 
all 
possible 
forms 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
nothing 
so 
absurd, 
so 
strange 
and 
contrary 
to 
what 
we 
call 
justice, 
could 
be 
imagined, 
which 
has 
not 
occurred 
or 
would 
not 
some 
day 
occur. 
These 
are 
exactly 
the 
opinions 
which 
Spinoza 
has 
more 
clearly 
explained, 
namely, 
that 
justice, 
beauty, 
order 
belong 
only 
to 
things 
in 
relation 
to 
us, 
but 
that 
the 
perfection 
of 
God 
consists 
in 
a 
fullness 
of 
action 
such 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
possible 
or 
conceivable 
which 
he 
does 
not 
actually 
produce. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
opinion 
of 
Hobbes 
who 
maintains 
that 
all 
that 
is 
possible 
is 
past, 
or 
present, 
or 
future, 
and 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
room 
for 
relying 
on 
providence 
if 
God 
produces 
all 
and 
makes 
no 
choice 
among 
possible 
beings. 
Descartes 
took 
care 
not 
to 
speak 
so 
plainly, 
but 
he 
could 
not 
help 
revealing 
his 
opinions 
in 
passing, 
with 
such 
address 
that 
he 
would 
not 
be 
understood 
save 
by 
those 
who 
examine 
profoundly 
these 
kinds 
of 
subjects. 
This, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
is 
the 



πρωτον 
ψευδος, 
the 
foundation 
of 
atheistic 
philosophy, 
which 
does 
not 
cease 
tosaythingsbeautifulin 
appearanceofGod. 
But 
the 
truephilosophyoughtto 
give 
us 
an 
entirely 
different 
notion 
of 
the 
perfection 
of 
God 
which 
could 
serve 
us 
both 
in 
physics 
and 
in 
morals; 
and 
I, 
for 
my 
part, 
hold 
that 
far 
from 
excluding 
final 
causes 
from 
the 
consideration 
of 
physics, 
as 
Descartes 
pretends, 
Part 
1, 
Article 
28, 
it 
is 
rather 
by 
them 
that 
all 
should 
be 
determined, 
since 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
things 
is 
intelligent, 
having 
a 
will 
and 
consequently 
tending 
towardtheGood,that 
whichis 
stillfarfromtheopinion 
of 
Descartes 
who 
holds 
that 
goodness, 
truth 
and 
justice 
are 
so 
simply 
because 
God 
by 
a 
free 
act 
of 
his 
will 
has 
established 
them, 
which 
is 
very 
strange. 
For 
if 
things 
are 
not 
good 
or 
bad, 
save 
by 
an 
effect 
of 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
the 
good 
will 
not 
be 
a 
motive 
of 
his 
will 
since 
it 
is 
subsequent 
to 
the 
will. 
And 
his 
will 
would 
be 
a 
certain 
absolute 
decree, 
without 
reason; 
here 
are 
his 
own 
words, 
Resp. 
ad 
object, 
sext. 
n. 
8: 
“Attendenti 
ad 
Dei 
immensitatem 
manifestum 
est, 
nihilomninoessepossequodadipsonon 
pendeat, 
nonmodonihil 
subsistens, 
sed 
etiam 
nullum 
ordinem, 
nullam 
legam, 
nullamve 
rationem 
veri 
et 
boni, 
alioqui 
enim, 
ut 
paulo 
ante 
dicebatur, 
non 
fuisset 
plane 
indifferens 
ad 
ea 
creanda 
quae 
ereavit 
[he 
was 
then 
indifferent 
as 
regards 
the 
things 
which 
we 
call 
just 
and 
unjust, 
and 
if 
it 
had 
pleased 
him 
to 
create 
a 
world 
in 
which 
the 
goodhadbeenforeverunhappyand 
thewicked 
(thatisto 
say,thosewhoseek 
only 
to 
destroy 
the 
others) 
happy, 
that 
would 
be 
just. 
Thus 
we 
cannot 
determine 
anything 
as 
to 
the 
justice 
of 
God, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
that 
he 
has 
made 
things 
in 
a 
way 
which 
we 
call 
unjust, 
since 
there 
is 
no 
notion 
of 
justice 
as 
respects 
him, 
and 
if 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
we 
are 
unhappy 
in 
spite 
of 
our 
piety, 
or 
that 
the 
soul 
perishes 
with 
the 
body, 
this 
will 
also 
be 
just. 
— 
He 
continues]: 
Nam

[without 
doubt, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
providence 
and 
of 
all 
our 
hopes; 
namely, 
that 
there 
is 
something 



good 
and 
just 
in 
itself, 
and 
that 
God, 
being 
Wisdom 
itself, 
does 
not 
fail 
to 
choose 
the 
best]. 
Sed 
contra 
quod 
se 
determinavit 
ad 
ea 
jam 
sunt 
facienda, 
idcireo, 
ut 
habetur 
in 
Genesi, 
sunt 
valde 
bona 
[this 
is 
cross 
reasoning. 
If 
things 
are 
not 
good 
by 
any 
idea 
or 
notion 
of 
goodness 
in 
themselves, 
but 
because 
God 
wills 
them, 
God, 
in 
Genesis, 
had 
but 
to 
consider 
them 
when 
they 
were 
made 
and 
to 
be 
satisfied 
with 
his 
work, 
saying 
that 
all 
was 
good; 
it 
would 
have 
sufficed 
for 
him 
to 
say, 
I 
will 
it, 
or 
to 
have 
remembered 
that 
he 
willed 
them, 
if 
there 
is 
no 
formal 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
things, 
to 
be 
willed 
by 
God, 
and 
to 
be 
good. 
But 
it 
is 
apparent 
that 
the 
author 
of 
Genesis 
was 
of 
another 
opinion, 
introducing 
a 
God 
who 
would 
not 
be 
content 
with 
having 
made 
them 
unless 
he 
found 
further 
that 
he 
had 
made 
them 
well.] 
hoc 
est 
ratio 
eorum 
bonitatis 
ex 
eo 
pendet, 
quod 
voluerit 
ipsa 
sic 
facere.” 
This 
is 
as 
distinct 
an 
expression 
as 
one 
could 
desire. 
But 
after 
this 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
goodness 
and 
justice 
of 
God, 
and 
providence 
will 
be 
but 
a 
chimera. 
It 
is 
evident 
that 
even 
the 
will 
of 
God 
will 
be 
but 
a 
fiction 
employed 
to 
dazzle 
those 
who 
do 
notsufficiently 
strive 
to 
fathom 
these 
things. 
For 
what 
kind 
of 
a 
will 
(good 
God!) 
is 
that 
which 
has 
not 
the 
Good 
as 
object 
or 
motive? 
What 
is 
more 
this 
God 
will 
not 
even 
have 
understanding. 
For 
if 
truth 
itself 
depends 
only 
on 
the 
will 
of 
God 
and 
not 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
and 
the 
understanding 
being 
necessarily 
BEFORE 
the 
will 
(I 
speak 
de 
prioritate 
naturae, 
non 
temp 
oris), 
the 
understanding 
of 
God 
will 
be 
before 
the 
truth 
of 
things 
and 
consequently 
will 
not 
have 
truth 
for 
its 
object. 
Such 
an 
understanding 
is 
undoubtedly 
nothing 
but 
a 
chimera, 
and 
consequently 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
conceive 
God, 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
Spinoza, 
as 
a 
being 
who 
has 
neither 
understanding 
nor 
will, 
but 
who 
produces 
quite 
indifferently 
good 
or 
bad, 
and 
who 
is 
indifferent 
respecting 
things 
and 
consequently 
inclined 
by 
no 
reason 
toward 
one 
rather 
than 
the 
other. 
Thus, 
he 
will 
either 
do 
nothing 
or 
he 
will 
do 
all. 
But 
to 
say 
that 
such 
a 
God 
has 
made 
things, 
or 
to 
say 
that 
they 



have 
been 
produced 
by 
a 
blind 
necessity, 
the 
one, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
is 
as 
good 
as 
the 
other. 
I 
have 
been 
sorry 
myself 
to 
find 
these 
things 
in 
Descartes, 
but 
I 
have 
seen 
no 
means 
of 
excusing 
them. 
I 
wish 
he 
could 
clear 
himself 
from 
these, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
some 
other 
imputations 
with 
which 
Morus 
and 
Parker 
have 
charged 
him. 
For 
to 
wish 
to 
explain 
everything 
mechanically 
in 
physics 
is 
not 
a 
crime 
nor 
impiety, 
since 
God 
has 
made 
all 
things 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
mathematics; 
that 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
eternal 
truths 
which 
are 
the 
object 
ofwisdom. 


There 
are 
still 
many 
other 
things 
in 
the 
works 
of 
Descartes 
which 
I 
consider 
erroneous 
and 
by 
which 
I 
judge 
that 
he 
has 
not 
penetrated 
so 
far 
in 
advance 
as 
is 
imagined. 
For 
example, 
in 
geometry, 
I 
do 
not 
really 
believe 
that 
he 
has 
made 
any 
paralogism 
(as 
you 
inform 
me 
that 
some 
one 
has 
said 
to 
you); 
he 
was 
a 
sufficiently 
skillful 
man 
to 
avoid 
that, 
and 
you 
see 
by 
this 
that 
I 
judge 
him 
equitably; 
but 
he 
has 
erred 
through 
too 
much 
presumption, 
holding 
all 
for 
impossible 
at 
which 
he 
saw 
no 
means 
of 
arriving; 
for 
example, 
he 
believed 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
find 
a 
proportion 
between 
a 
curved 
line 
and 
a 
straight 
line. 
Here 
are 
his 
own 
words:

In 
which, 
estimating 
the 
powers 
of 
all 
posterity 
by 
his 
own, 
he 
was 
very 
much 
mistaken. 
For 
a 
little 
while 
after 
his 
death 
a 
method 
was 
found 
of 
giving 
an 
infinity 
of 
curved 
lines 
to 
which 
could 
be 
geometrically 
assigned 
equal 
straight 
lines. 
He 
would 
have 
perceived 
it 
himself 
if 
he 
had 
considered 
sufficiently 
the 
dexterity 
of 
Archimedes. 
He 
is 
persuaded 
that, 
all 
problems 
may 
be 
reduced 
to 
equations

This 
is 
wholly 
false, 
as 
Huygens, 
Hudde 
and 



others 
who 
thoroughly 
understand 
Descartes’ 
geometry, 
have 
frankly 
avowed 
to 
me. 
This 
is 
why 
there 
is 
need 
of 
much 
before 
algebra 
can 
do 
all 
that 
is 
promised 
for 
her. 
I 
do 
not 
speak 
lightly 
and 
there 
are 
few 
people 
who 
have 
examinedthematterwithasmuch 
careasI. 


The 
physics 
of 
Descartes 
has 
a 
great 
defect; 
this 
is 
that 
his 
rules 
of 
motion 
or 
laws 
of 
nature, 
which 
should 
serve 
as 
its 
foundation, 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
false. 
There 
is 
demonstration 
of 
this. 
His 
great 
principle 
also 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
motion 
is 
preserved 
in 
the 
world 
is 
an 
error. 
What 
I 
say 
here 
is 
acknowledgedbytheablestmenof 
FranceandEngland. 


Judge 
from 
this, 
sir, 
whether 
there 
is 
reason 
for 
taking 
the 
opinions 
of 
Descartes 
for 
oracles. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
hinder 
me 
from 
considering 
him 
an 
admirable 
man, 
and 
for 
saying 
between 
ourselves 
that 
if 
he 
still 
lived 
perhaps 
he 
alone 
would 
advance 
farther 
in 
physics 
than 
a 
great 
number 
of 
others, 
although 
very 
able 
men. 
That 
befalls 
me 
here 
which 
ordinarily 
befalls 
moderate 
men. 
The 
Peripatetics 
regard 
me 
as 
a 
Cartesian, 
and 
the 
Cartesians 
are 
surprised 
that 
I 
do 
not 
yield 
to 
all 
their 
pretended 
lights. 
For 
when 
I 
speak 
to 
prepossessed 
men 
of 
the 
school 
who 
treat 
Descartes 
with 
scorn, 
I 
extol 
the 
brilliancy 
of 
his 
qualities; 
but 
when 
I 
have 
to 
do 
with 
a 
too 
zealous 
Cartesian 
I 
find 
myself 
obliged 
to 
change 
my 
note 
in 
order 
to 
modify 
a 
little 
the 
too 
high 
opinion 
which 
they 
have 
of 
their 
master. 
The 
greatest 
men 
of 
the 
time 
in 
these 
matters 
are 
not 
Cartesians, 
or 
if 
they 
have 
been 
in 
their 
youth 
they 
have 
gotten 
over 
it, 
and 
I 
notice 
among 
the 
people 
who 
make 
a 
profession 
of 
philosophy 
and 
of 
mathematics, 
that 
those 
who 
are 
properly 
Cartesians 
ordinarily 
remain 
among 
the 
mediocre 
and 
invent 
nothing 
of 
importance, 
being 
but 
commentators 
of 
their 
master, 
although 
for 
the 
rest 
they 
may 
be 
moreablethan 
the 
manoftheschool.

Sir, 
since 
you 
desire 
very 
much 
that 
I 
express 
freely 
my 
thoughts 
on 
Cartesianism, 
I 
shall 
not 
conceal 
aught 
of 
what 
I 
think 
of 
it, 
and 
which 
I 
can 
say 
in 
few 
words; 
and 
I 
shall 
advance 
nothing 
without 
giving 
or 
being 
able 
to 
give 
a 
reason 
for 
it. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
all 
those 
who 
give 
themselves 
over 
absolutely 
to 
the 
opinions 
of 
any 
author 
are 
in 
a 
slavery 
and 
render 
themselves 
suspected 
of 
error, 
for 
to 
say 
that 
Descartes 
is 
the 
only 
author 
who 
is 
exempt 
from 
considerable 
error, 
is 
a 
proposition 
which 
could 
be 
true 
butisnotlikelyto 
beso. 
In 
fact,suchattachmentbelongsonly 
tosmallminds 
who 
have 
not 
the 
force 
or 
the 
leisure 
to 
meditate 
themselves, 
or 
will 
not 
give 
themselves 
the 
trouble 
to 
do 
so. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
three 
illustrious 
academies 
of 
our 
times, 
the 
Royal 
Society 
of 
England, 
which 
was 
established 
first, 
and 
then 
the 
Academie 
Royale 
des 
Sciences, 
at 
Paris, 
and 
the 
Academia 
del 
Cimento, 
at 
Florence, 
have 
loudly 
protested 
that 
they 
wish 
to 
be 
known 
neither 
as 
Aristotelians, 
nor 
Cartesians, 
nor 
Epicureans, 
nor 
followers 
of 
any 
authorwhatever. 


I 
have 
also 
recognized 
by 
experience 
that 
those 
who 
are 
wholly 
Cartesians 
are 
not 
adepts 
in 
inventing, 
they 
are 
but 
interpreters 
or 
commentators 
of 
their 
master, 
as 
the 
philosophers 
of 
the 
school 
were 
of 
Aristotle; 
and 
of 
the 
many 
beautiful 
discoveries 
which 
have 
been 
made 
since 
Descartes, 
I 
know 
of 
not 
one 
which 
comes 
from 
a 
true 
Cartesian. 
I 
know 
these 
gentlemen 
a 
little 
and 
I 
defy 
them 
to 
name 
one 
coming 
from 
them. 
This 
is 
an 
evidence 
that 
Descartes 
didnotknowthe 
truemethodor 
thathehasnottransmittedittothem. 


Descartes 
himself 
had 
a 
sufficiently 
limited 
mind. 
Of 
all 
men 
he 
excelled 
in 
speculations, 
but 
in 
them 
he 
found 
nothing 
useful 
for 
life 
which 
is 
evident 
to 
the 
senses 
and 
which 
serves 
in 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
arts. 
All 
his 
meditations 
were 
either 
too 
abstract, 
like 
his 
metaphysics 
and 
his 
geometry, 
or 
too 
imaginary, 
like 
his 
principles 
of 
natural 
philosophy. 
The 
only 
thing 
of 
use 
which 
he 
believed 
he 
had 
given 
was 
his 
telescope, 
made 
according 
to 
the 



hyperbolic 
line, 
with 
which 
he 
promised 
to 
make 
us 
see 
animals, 
or 
parts 
as 
small 
as 
animals, 
in 
the 
moon. 
Unfortunately 
he 
was 
never 
able 
to 
find 
workmen 
capable 
of 
executing 
his 
design, 
and 
since 
then 
it 
has 
even 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
hyperbolic 
line 
is 
not 
so 
great 
as 
he 
believed. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
Descartes 
was 
a 
great 
genius 
and 
that 
the 
sciences 
are 
under 
great 
obligations 
to 
him, 
but 
not 
in 
the 
way 
the 
Cartesians 
believe. 
I 
must 
therefore 
enter 
a 
little 
into 
details 
and 
give 
examples 
of 
what 
he 
has 
taken 
from 
others, 
of 
what 
he 
has 
himself 
done, 
and 
of 
what 
he 
has 
left 
to 
be 
done. 
From 
this 
it 
will 
be 
seen 
whether 
I 
speak 
without 
knowledge 
of 
the 
subject. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
his 
ETHICS 
is 
a 
compound 
of 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
Stoics 
and 
of 
the 
Epicureans, 
something 
not 
very 
difficult, 
for 
Seneca 
had 
already 
reconciled 
them 
very 
well. 
He 
wishes 
us 
to 
follow 
reason, 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
as 
the 
Stoics 
said, 
with 
which 
everybody 
will 
agree. 
He 
adds 
that 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
disturbed 
by 
the 
things 
which 
are 
not 
in 
our 
power. 
This 
is 
exactly 
the 
dogma 
of 
the 
Portico 
which 
established 
the 
greatness 
and 
liberty 
of 
their 
sage, 
so 
praised 
for 
the 
strength 
of 
mind 
which 
he 
had 
in 
resolvingto 
dowithoutthethings 
whichdonotdepend 
uponusandtoendure 
them 
when 
they 
come 
in 
spite 
of 
us. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
I 
am 
wont 
to 
call 
this 
ethics 
the 
art 
of 
patience. 
The 
Sovereign 
Good, 
according 
to 
the 
Stoics 
and 
according 
to 
Aristotle 
himself, 
was 
to 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
virtue 
or 
prudence, 
and 
the 
pleasure 
resulting 
therefrom 
together 
with 
the 
resolution 
mentioned 
above 
is 
properly 
that 
tranquility 
of 
the 
soul, 
or 
indolence, 
which 
the 
Stoics 
and 
Epicureans 
sought 
and 
equally 
recommended 
under 
different 
names. 
One 
has 
only 
to 
examine 
the 
incomparable 
Manual 
of 
Epictetus 
and 
the 
Epicurus 
of 
Laertius 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
Descartes 
has 
not 
advanced 
the 
practice 
of 
morals. 
But 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
art 
of 
patience 
in 
which 
he 
makes 
the 
art 
of 
living 
consist, 
is 
yet 
not 
the 
whole. 
A 
patience 
without 
hope 
does 
not 
endure 
and 
does 
not 
console, 
and 
it 
is 
here 
that 
Plato, 
in 
my 
opinion, 



surpasses 
the 
others, 
for 
by 
good 
arguments 
he 
makes 
us 
hope 
for 
a 
better 
life 
and 
approaches 
nearest 
to 
Christianity. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
to 
read 
the 
excellent 
dialogue 
on 
the 
Immortality 
of 
the 
Soul 
or 
the 
Death 
of 
Socrates, 
which 
Theophilehas 
translated 
into 
Trench, 
toconceiveahighidea 
of 
it. 
Ithink 
that 
Pythagoras 
did 
the 
same, 
and 
that 
his 
metempsychosis 
was 
merely 
to 
accommodate 
himself 
to 
the 
range 
of 
common 
people, 
but 
that 
among 
his 
disciples 
he 
reasoned 
quite 
differently. 
Also 
Ocellus 
Lucanus, 
who 
was 
one 
of 
them, 
and 
from 
whom 
we 
have 
a 
small 
but 
excellent 
fragment 
on 
the 
universe, 
says 
not 
a 
word 
of 
it. 
It 
will 
be 
said 
that 
Descartes 
establishes 
very 
well 
the 
EXISTENCE 
OF 
GOD 
and 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul. 
But 
I 
fear 
that 
we 
are 
deceived 
by 
fine 
words, 
for 
the 
God, 
or 
Perfect 
Being, 
of 
Descartes 
is 
not 
a 
God 
such 
as 
we 
imagine 
him 
and 
such 
as 
we 
desire; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
just 
and 
wise, 
doing 
everything 
for 
the 
good 
of 
creatures 
as 
far 
as 
is 
possible, 
but 
rather 
he 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
God 
of 
Spinoza, 
namely, 
the 
principle 
of 
things, 
and 
a 
certain 
sovereign 
power 
or 
primitive 
nature 
which 
sets 
everything 
in 
action 
and 
does 
everything 
which 
is 
feasible. 
The 
God 
of 
Descarteshas 
neitherwill 
nor 
understanding, 
since 
according 
to 
Descartes 
he 
has 
not 
the 
Good 
as 
the 
object 
of 
the 
will 
nor 
the 
True 
as 
object 
of 
the 
understanding. 
Also 
he 
does 
not 
wish 
that 
his 
God 
should 
act 
according 
to 
some 
end, 
and 
for 
this 
reason 
he 
rejects 
from 
philosophy 
the 
search 
after 
final 
causes, 
under 
the 
adroit 
pretext 
that 
we 
are 
not 
capable 
of 
knowing 
the 
ends 
of 
God. 
Plato, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
has 
very 
well 
shown 
that 
God 
being 
the 
author 
of 
things 
and 
provided 
he 
acts 
according 
to 
wisdom, 
true 
physics 
is 
to 
know 
the 
ends 
and 
the 
uses 
of 
things, 
for 
science 
is 
the 
knowledge 
of 
reasons, 
and 
the 
reasons 
of 
what 
has 
been 
made 
by 
an 
understanding 
are 
the 
final 
causes 
or 
the 
designs 
of 
him 
who 
made 
them, 
and 
these 
appear 
from 
the 
use 
and 
the 
function 
which 
they 
have. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
use 
of 
parts 
is 
so 
useful 
in 
anatomy. 
This 
is 
why 
a 
God 
such 
as 
that 
of 
Descartes 
leaves 
us 



no 
other 
consolation 
than 
that 
of 
patience 
par 
force. 
He 
says 
in 
some 
passages 
that 
matter 
passes 
successively 
through 
all 
possible 
forms; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
his 
God 
does 
everything 
which 
is 
feasible 
and 
passes, 
following 
a 
necessary 
and 
fated 
order, 
through 
all 
possible 
combinations; 
but 
for 
this 
the 
mere 
necessity 
of 
matter 
sufficed, 
or 
rather 
his 
God 
is 
nothing 
but 
this 
necessity, 
or 
this 
principle 
of 
necessity, 
acting 
in 
matter 
as 
it 
can. 
It 
must 
not, 
therefore, 
be 
believed 
that 
this 
God 
has 
any 
more 
care 
of 
intelligent 
creatures 
than 
of 
the 
others. 
Each 
one 
will 
be 
happy 
or 
unhappy, 
according 
as 
it 
will 
find 
itself 
involved 
in 
great 
torrents 
or 
whirlpools; 
and 
he 
is 
right 
in 
recommending 
to 
us 
patience 
without 
hope 
(in 
place 
of 
felicity). 
But 
some 
one 
of 
the 
better 
class 
of 
Cartesians, 
deluded 
by 
the 
fine 
discourses 
of 
his 
master, 
will 
say 
to 
me 
that 
he 
nevertheless 
establishes 
very 
well 
the 
IMMORTALITY 
OF 
THE 
SOUL 
andconsequently 
a 
better 
life. 
When 
I 
hear 
these 
things 
I 
am 
astonished 
at 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
the 
world 
is 
deceived, 
if 
one 
can 
merely 
play 
adroitly 
with 
agreeable 
words, 
although 
their 
meaning 
is 
corrupted; 
for 
just 
as 
hypocrites 
abuse 
piety, 
heretics 
the 
scriptures, 
and 
the 
seditious 
the 
word 
liberty, 
so 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
abused 
those 
grand 
words, 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
and 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul. 
It 
is 
necessary, 
therefore, 
to 
unravel 
this 
mystery 
and 
to 
show 
them 
that 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul, 
following 
Descartes, 
is 
worth 
no 
more 
than 
his 
God. 
I 
well 
believe 
that 
I 
shall 
not 
please 
some, 
for 
people 
do 
not 
enjoy 
being 
awakened 
when 
their 
minds 
are 
occupied 
with 
an 
agreeable 
dream. 
But 
what 
is 
to 
be 
done? 
Descartes 
teaches 
that 
false 
thoughts 
should 
be 
uprooted 
before 
true 
ones 
are 
introduced; 
his 
example 
ought 
to 
be 
followed, 
and 
I 
shall 
think 
that 
I 
am 
rendering 
a 
service 
to 
the 
public 
if 
I 
can 
disabuse 
them 
of 
such 
dangerous 
doctrines. 
I 
say 
then 
that 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul, 
as 
it 
is 
established 
by 
Descartes,is 
ofnouseandcan 
innoway 
console 
us. 
Forgrantthat 
the 
soulis 
a 
substance 
and 
that 
no 
substance 
perishes; 
this 
being 
so 
the 
soul 
will 
not 



perish, 
but 
in 
reality 
also 
nothing 
perishes 
in 
nature. 
But 
like 
matter 
the 
soul 
too 
will 
change 
in 
form, 
and 
as 
the 
matter 
composing 
a 
man 
has 
at 
other 
times 
formed 
plants 
and 
other 
animals, 
so 
this 
soul 
may 
be 
immortal 
in 
reality 
but 
it 
will 
pass 
through 
a 
thousand 
changes 
and 
not 
remember 
at 
all 
what 
it 
has 
been. 
But 
this 
immortality 
without 
memory 
is 
altogether 
useless, 
viewed 
ethically, 
for 
it 
destroys 
all 
reward, 
all 
recompense, 
and 
all 
punishment. 
Of 
what 
use 
would 
it 
be 
to 
you, 
sir, 
to 
become 
king 
of 
China 
on 
conditionof 
forgettingwhat 
youhave 
been. 
Woulditnotbethesamethingas 
if 
God 
at 
the 
sametime 
thathe 
destroyedyoucreated 
a 
king 
in 
China?This 
is 
why, 
in 
order 
to 
satisfy 
the 
hope 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
it 
must 
be 
proved 
that 
the 
God 
who 
governs 
all 
is 
wise 
and 
just, 
and 
that 
he 
will 
leave 
nothing 
without 
recompense 
and 
without 
punishment. 
These 
are 
the 
great 
foundations 
of 
ethics; 
but 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
God 
who 
does 
not 
act 
for 
the 
Good, 
and 
of 
a 
soul 
which 
is 
immortal 
without 
memory, 
serves 
only 
to 
deceive 
the 
simple 
and 
to 
pervertthespiritually 
minded. 


I 
could, 
however, 
show 
mistakes 
in 
the 
pretended 
demonstration 
of 
Descartes, 
for 
there 
are 
still 
many 
things 
to 
be 
proved 
in 
order 
to 
complete 
it. 
But 
I 
think 
that 
at 
present 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
amuse 
one’s 
self 
thus, 
since 
these 
demonstrations 
would 
be 
of 
almost 
no 
use, 
as 
I 
have 
just 
shown, 
even 
if 
they 
weregood.

He 
says 
that

limited 
because

Addtothis 
what

Prop.

DEFINITION 
3. 
Substance 
is 
that 
which 
is 
in 
itself 
and 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself. 
This 
also 
is 
obscure. 
For 
what 
is 
it 
to 
be 
in 
itself? 
Then 
we 
must 
ask, 
Are 
to 
be 
in 
itself 
and 
to 
be 
conceived 
through 
itself 
conjoined 
cumulatively 
or 
disjunctively? 
That 
is, 
whether 
this 
means: 
Substance 
is 
that 
which 
is 
in 
itself, 
also 
substance 
is 
that 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself; 
or, 
indeed, 
whether 
it 
means: 
Substance 
is 
that 
in 
which 
both 
these 
concur; 
namely,thatitbothisinitselfandisconceivedthroughitself. 


Or 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
for 
him 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
what 
has 
the 
one, 
has 
also 
the 
other, 
when 
rather, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
seems 
that 
there 
are 
some 
things 
which 
are 
in 
themselves 
although 
they 
are 
not 
conceived 
through 
themselves. 
And 
so 
men 
usually 
conceive 
substances. 
He 
adds: 
Substance 
is 
that, 
the 
conception 
of 
which 
does 
not 
require 
the 
conception 
of 
another 
thing. 
But 
there 
is 
also 
a 
difficulty 
in 
this, 
for 
in 
the 
following 
definition 
he 
says, 
An 
attribute 
is 
that 
which 
the 
intellect 
perceives 
of 
substance 
as 
constituting 
its 
essence. 
Therefore 
the 
concept 
of 
attribute 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 



formation 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
substance. 
If 
you 
say 
that 
the 
attribute 
is 
not 
the 
thing 
itself, 
but 
require 
indeed 
that 
substance 
shall 
not 
need 
the 
conception 
of 
another 
thing, 
I 
reply: 
You 
must 
explain 
what 
is 
called 
thing, 
that 
we 
may 
understand 
thedefinitionandhow 
the 
attributeis 
notthething.

That 
an 
attribute 
is 
that 
which 
the

perceives 
of 
substance 
as 
constituting 
its 
essence, 
is 
also 
obscure. 
For 
we 
ask 
whether 
by 
attribute 
he 
understands 
every 
reciprocal 
predicate; 
or 
every 
essential 
predicate 
whether

not;

A

It 
seems, 
therefore, 
to 
differ 
from 
attribute 
in 
this, 
that 
attribute 
is 
indeed 
something 
in 
substance, 
yet 
is

DEFINITION 
6. 
God, 
he 
says, 
I 
define 
as 
a 
being 
absolutely 
infinite, 
or 
a 
substanceconsistingininfiniteattributes,ofwhicheachexpresseseternaland

He 
ought 
to 
show 
that 
these 
two 
definitions 
are 
equivalents, 
otherwise 
he 
cannot 
substitute 
the 
one 
in 
place 
of 
the 
other. 
But 
they 
will 
be 
equivalents 
when 
he 
shall 
have 
shown 
that 
there 
are 
many 
attributes 
or 
predicates 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
which 
are 
conceived 
through 
themselves; 
likewise, 
when 
he 
shall 
have 
shown 
that 
many 
predicates 
can 
co-exist. 
Moreover, 
every 
definition 
(although 
it 
may 
be 
true 
and 
clear), 
is 
imperfect, 
which, 
although 
understood, 
allows 
of 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
thing 
defined. 
This, 
moreover, 
is 
such 
a 
definition, 
for 
thus 
far 
it 
may 
be 
doubted 
whether 
being 
does 
not 
imply 
having 
infinite 
attributes. 
Or 
for 
this 
reason, 
because 
it 
may 
be 
questioned 
whether 
the 
same 
simple 
essence 
can 
be 
expressed 
by 
many 
diverse 
attributes. 
There 
are, 
indeed, 
many 
definitions 
of 
compound 
things 
but 
only 
a 
single 
one 
of 
a 
simple 
thing, 
nor 
does 
it 
seem 
that 
itsessence 
canbe 
expressed

A

thing 
is 
that 
which

and

to

by 
the

of

a

DEFINITION 
8. 
By 
eternity 
I 
understand 
existence 
itself 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
conceived 
to 
follow 
from 
the 
essence 
of 
a 
thing. 
These 
definitions 
[i. 
e. 
7 
and 
8], 
Iapprove. 


As 
to 
the 
AXIOMS, 
I 
note 
these 
things: 
The 
first 
is 
obscure 
as 
long 
as 
it 
is 
not 
established 
what 
to 
be 
in 
itself 
is. 
The 
second 
and 
seventh 
require 
no 
comment. 
The 
sixth 
seems 
incongruous, 
for 
every 
idea 
agrees 
with 
its 
ideate, 
nor 
do 
I 
see 
what 
a 
false 
idea 
can 
be. 
The 
third, 
fourth 
and 
fifth 
can, 
I 
think, 
bedemonstrated. 


PROPOSITION 
1. 
Substance 
is 
by 
nature 
prior 
to 
its 
modifications; 
that 
is, 
modes, 
for 
in 
Def. 
5 
he 
said 
that 
by 
modifications 
of 
substance 
he 
understands 
modes. 
Still 
he 
did 
not 
explain 
what 
to 
be 
by 
nature 
prior 
is, 
and 
thus 
this 
proposition 
cannot 
be 
demonstrated 
from 
what 
precedes. 
Moreover, 
by 
nature 
prior 
to 
another 
seems 
to 
mean 
that 
through 
which 
another 
is 
conceived. 
Besides 
I 
confess 
that 
there 
is 
some 
difficulty 
in 
this, 
for 
it 
seems 
that 
not 
only 
can 
posterior 
things 
be 
conceived 
through 
the 
prior, 
but 
also 
prior 
things 
through 
the 
posterior. 
Nevertheless, 
prior 
by 
nature 
may 
be 
defined 
in 
this 
way, 
as 
that 
which 
can 
be 
conceived 
without 
another 
thing 
beingconceived;as 
also,on 
the 
other 
hand,theother,second 
thing,cannotbe 
conceived 
except 
the 
first 
itself 
be 
conceived. 
But 
if 
I 
may 
say 
what 
the 
matter 
is, 
priorby 
nature 
is 
a 
little 
too 
broad; 
for 
example,the 
property 
often, 
that 
it 
is 
6 
+ 
4, 
is 
by 
nature 
posterior 
to 
this, 
that 
it 
is 
6 
+ 
3 
+ 
1 
(because 
the 
latter 
is 
nearer 
to 
the 
first 
of 
all: 
ten 
is 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1 
+ 
1) 
and 
nevertheless 
it 
can 
be 
conceived 
without 
this; 
nay, 
what 
is 
more, 
it 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
without 
it. 
I 
add 
another 
example: 
The 
property 
in 
a 
triangle, 
that 
the 
three 
internal 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles 
is 
by 
nature 



posterior 
to 
this: 
that 
two 
internal 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
the 
external 
angle 
of 
the 
third, 
and 
nevertheless 
the 
former 
can 
be 
conceived 
without 
the 
latter; 
nay, 
even,althoughnotequallyeasily,itcanbedemonstrated 
withoutit. 


PROPOSITION 
2. 
Two 
substances 
whose 
attributes 
are 
diverse 
have 
nothing 
in 
common. 
If 
by 
attributes 
he 
means 
predicates 
which 
are 
conceived 
through 
themselves, 
I 
concede 
the 
proposition, 
it 
being 
posited, 
however, 
that 
there 
are 
two 
substances, 
A 
and 
B, 
and 
that 
C 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
substance 
A, 
d 
an 
attribute 
of 
substance 
B; 
or 
if 
c, 
e 
are 
all 
the 
attributes 
of 
substance 
A, 
likewise 
d 
f 
are 
all 
the 
attributes 
of 
substance 
B. 
It 
is 
not 
so 
if 
these 
two 
substances 
have 
some 
diverse 
attributes, 
some 
common 
attributes, 
as 
if 
the 
attributes 
of 
A 
itself 
were 
c, 
d 
and 
of 
B 
itself 
were 
d 
f. 
But 
if 
he 
denies 
that 
this 
can 
happen, 
the 
impossibility 
must 
be 
demonstrated. 
He 
will, 
perchance, 
in 
case 
of 
objection, 
demonstrate 
the 
proposition 
itself 
in 
this 
way: 
Because 
d 
and 
c 
equally 
express 
the 
same 
essence 
(since 
ex 
hypothesi 
they 
are 
attributes 
of 
the 
same 
substance, 
A), 
and 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
also 
d 
and 
f 
(since 
also 
ex 
hypothesi 
they 
are 
attributes 
of 
the 
same 
substance, 
B); 
therefore 
c 
and 
f 
express 
the 
same 
essence. 
Whence 
it 
follows 
that 
A 
and 
B 
are 
the 
same 
substance, 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
hypothesis; 
therefore 
it 
is 
absurd 
to 
say 
that 
two 
diverse 
substances 
have 
anything 
in 
common. 
I 
reply, 
that 
I 
do 
not 
concede 
that 
there 
could 
be 
two 
attributes 
which 
can 
be 
conceived 
through 
themselves, 
and 
nevertheless 
express 
the 
same 
thing. 
For 
whenever 
this 
happensthen 
these 
two 
attributes, 
expressing 
thesame 
thing 
ina 
diverseway, 
can 
moreover 
be 
resolved, 
or 
at 
least 
one 
or 
the 
other 
of 
them. 
This 
I 
can 
easily 
demonstrate. 


PROPOSITION 
3. 
Things 
which 
have 
nothing 
in 
common 
cannot 
be 
the 
one 
the 
causeofthe 
other,byAxioms5and 
4. 


PROPOSITION 
4. 
Two 
or 
more 
distinct 
things 
are 
distinguished 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
either 
by 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
attributes 
of 
the 
substances 
or 
by 
the 



difference 
of 
their 
modifications. 
He 
demonstrates 
this 
thus: 
Everything 
which 
exists, 
exists 
either 
in 
itself 
or 
in 
something 
else, 
by 
Axiom 
1; 
that 
is, 
by 
Defs. 
3 
and 
5, 
nothing 
is 
granted 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
understanding, 
except 
substances 
and 
their 
modifications. 
[Here 
I 
am 
surprised 
that 
he 
forgets 
attributes 
for, 
Def. 
5, 
by 
modification 
of 
substance 
he 
understands 
only 
modes; 
it 
follows, 
therefore, 
either 
that 
he 
spoke 
ambiguously, 
or 
that 
attributes 
are 
not 
numbered 
by 
him 
among 
the 
things 
existing 
outside 
of 
the 
understanding, 
but 
only 
substances 
and 
modes. 
Still 
he 
could 
have 
proved 
the 
proposition 
more 
easily 
if 
only 
he 
had 
added, 
that 
things 
which 
can 
be 
conceived 
through 
attributes 
or 
modifications 
are 
necessarily 
known 
and 
thereforedistinguished.] 


PROPOSITION 
5. 
There 
cannot 
be 
given 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
two 
or 
moresubstances 
havingthesamenatureorattribute. 


[I 
note 
here 
what 
seems 
to 
be 
obscure 
in 
this, 
viz: 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things. 
Does 
he 
mean, 
in 
the 
universe 
of 
existing 
things, 
or 
in 
the 
region 
of 
ideas 
or 
possible 
essences. 
Then 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
whether 
he 
wishes 
to 
say 
that 
many 
essences 
are 
not 
given 
having 
the 
same 
common 
attribute, 
or 
whether 
he 
wishes 
to 
say 
many 
individuals 
are 
not 
given 
having 
the 
same 
essence. 
I 
wonder 
indeed 
why 
he 
here 
employs 
the 
words 
nature 
and 
attribute 
as 
equivalents, 
unless 
he 
understands 
by 
attribute 
that 
which 
contains 
the 
whole 
nature. 
Which 
being 
posited, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
there 
can 
be 
given 
many 
attributes 
of 
the 
same 
substance 
which 
may 
be 
conceived 
through 
themselves.] 
Demonstration: 
If 
they 
are 
distinguished, 
they 
are 
distinguished 
either 
by 
their 
modifications 
or 
by 
their 
attributes; 
if 
by 
their 
modifications, 
then 
since 
substance 
is 
by 
nature 
prior 
to 
its 
modifications, 
by 
Prop. 
1, 
their 
modifications 
being 
put 
aside, 
they 
must 
still 
be 
distinguished, 
therefore, 
by 
their 
attributes; 
if 
by 
their 
attributes, 
then 
two 
substances 
are 
not 
given 
possessing 
the 
same 
attribute. 
I 
reply 
that 
a 
paralogism 
seems 
to 
lurk 
here. 



For 
two 
substances 
can 
be 
distinguished 
by 
attributes, 
and 
yet 
have 
some 
common 
attribute, 
provided 
they 
also 
have 
in 
addition 
some 
which 
are 
peculiar. 
For 
example, 
A 
and 
B; 
the 
attribute 
of 
the 
one 
being 
c 
d, 
of 
the 
other, 
de. 
I 
remark 
that 
Prop. 
1 
is 
only 
useful 
for 
this. 
But 
it 
might 
have 
been 
omitted 
because 
it 
suffices 
that 
substance 
can 
be 
conceived 
without 
modificationswhetherit 
bebynatureprior 
ornot. 


PROPOSITION 
6. 
One 
substance 
cannot 
be 
produced 
by 
another 
substance, 
for 
two 
substances, 
by 
Prop. 
5, 
do 
not 
possess 
the 
same 
attribute, 
therefore 
they 
have 
nothing 
in 
common, 
by 
Prop. 
2; 
therefore, 
it 
cannot 
be 
that 
one 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
other, 
by 
Axiom 
5. 
The 
same 
in 
other 
words 
and 
more 
briefly: 
Because 
what 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
through 
another 
as 
cause, 
by 
Axiom 
4. 
But 
I 
reply, 
that 
I 
grant 
the 
demonstration, 
if 
substance 
is 
understood 
as 
a 
thing 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself; 
it 
is 
otherwise 
if 
it 
is 
understood 
as 
a 
thing 
which 
is 
in 
itself, 
as 
men 
commonly 
understand 
it, 
unless 
it 
be 
shown 
that 
it 
be 
in 
itself 
and 
to 
be 
conceivedthroughitselfare 
thesamething. 


PROPOSITION7. 
Existencebelongsto 
thenatureofsubstance. 
Substance 
cannot 
be 
produced 
by 
anything 
else, 
Prop. 
6. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
itself; 
that 
is, 
by 
Def. 
1, 
its 
essence 
involves 
existence. 
He 
is 
not 
unjustly 
censured 
because 
sometimes 
he 
employs 
cause 
of 
itself 
as 
a 
definite 
something 
to 
which 
he 
ascribes 
a 
peculiar 
signification, 
Def. 
1; 
sometimes 
he 
uses 
it 
in 
the 
common 
and 
vulgar 
meaning. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
remedy 
is 
easy, 
if 
heconvertsthisDef. 
1 
intoanAxiomandsays: 
Whateverisnotbyanother, 
is 
by 
itself 
or 
of 
its 
own 
essence. 
But 
here 
other 
difficulties 
still 
exist: 
the 
reasoning, 
namely, 
is 
valid 
only 
when 
it 
is 
posited 
that 
substance 
can 
exist. 
For 
it 
is 
then 
necessary 
that, 
since 
it 
cannot 
be 
produced 
by 
another, 
it 
exists 
by 
itself, 
and 
thus 
necessarily 
exist; 
but 
it 
must 
be 
demonstrated 
that 
it 
is 
a 
possible 
substance; 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
can 
be 
conceived. 
It 
seems 
that 
it 
can 
be 



demonstrated 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
if 
nothing 
can 
be 
conceived 
through 
itself 
nothing 
also 
can 
be 
conceived 
through 
another, 
and 
hence 
nothing 
at 
all 
can 
be 
conceived. 
But 
that 
it 
may 
he 
shown 
distinctly, 
we 
must 
consider 
that 
if 
a 
is 
posited 
as 
conceived 
through 
b, 
there 
is 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
itself 
the 
conception 
of 
b 
itself. 
And 
again, 
if 
b 
is 
conceived 
through 
c, 
there 
is 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
b 
the 
conception 
of 
c 
itself, 
and 
thus 
the 
conception 
of 
c 
itself 
will 
be 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
itself, 
and 
so 
on 
to 
the 
last. 
But 
if 
any 
one 
reply 
that 
the 
last 
is 
not 
given, 
I 
answer, 
neither 
is 
the 
first, 
which 
I 
thus 
show. 
Because 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
that 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
another 
there 
is 
nothing 
except 
what 
belongs 
to 
the 
other, 
so 
step 
by 
step 
through 
many 
there 
will 
either 
be 
nothing 
at 
all 
in 
it 
or 
nothing 
except 
what 
is 
conceived 
through 
it 
itself; 
which 
demonstration, 
I 
think, 
is 
wholly 
new 
but 
infallible. 
By 
this 
means 
we 
can 
demonstrate 
that 
what 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself 
can 
be 
conceived. 
But 
nevertheless, 
thus 
far 
it 
can 
be 
doubted 
whether 
it 
be 
possible 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
it 
is 
here 
assumed 
to 
be 
possible, 
certainly 
not 
for 
that 
which 
can 
be 
conceived, 
but 
for 
that 
of 
which 
some 
cause 
can 
be 
conceived, 
to 
be 
resolved 
into 
the 
first. 
For 
those 
things 
which 
can 
be 
conceived 
by 
us, 
nevertheless 
cannot 
therefore 
all 
be 
produced, 
on 
account 
of 
others 
which 
are 
preferable 
and 
with 
which 
they 
are 
incompatible. 
Therefore, 
being 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself 
must 
be 
proved 
to 
be 
in 
actual 
existence 
by 
the 
additional 
evidence 
that 
because 
those 
things 
exist 
which 
are 
conceived 
through 
another, 
therefore 
that 
also 
through 
which 
they 
are 
conceived, 
exists. 
You 
see 
what 
very 
different 
reasoning 
is 
needed 
for 
accurately 
proving 
that 
a 
thing 
exists 
through 
itself. 
However, 
perhaps 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
this 
extreme 
caution. 


PROPOSITION 
8. 
Every 
substance 
is 
necessarily 
infinite, 
since 
otherwise 
it 
would 
be 
limited 
by 
another 
of 
the 
same 
nature, 
by 
Def. 
2, 
and 
two 
substances 
would 
be 
given 
with 
the 
same 
attribute, 
contrary 
to 
Prop. 
5. 
This 



proposition 
must 
be 
understood 
thus: 
A 
thing 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself 
is 
infinite 
in 
its 
own 
kind, 
and 
thus 
is 
to 
be 
admitted. 
But 
the 
demonstration 
labors 
not 
only 
with 
obscurity 
as 
respects 
this 
is 
limited, 
but 
also 
with 
uncertainty, 
by 
reason 
of 
Prop. 
5. 
In 
the 
scholium 
he 
has 
excellent 
reasoning 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
thing 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself 
is 
one, 
of 
course 
after 
its 
kind, 
since 
many 
individuals 
are 
posited 
as 
existing, 
therefore 
there 
ought 
to 
be 
a 
reason 
in 
nature 
why 
there 
are 
so 
many, 
not 
more. 
The 
reason 
which 
accounts 
for 
there 
being 
so 
many 
accounts 
for 
this 
one 
and 
that 
one; 
hence 
also 
for 
this 
other 
one. 
But 
this 
reason 
is 
not 
found 
in 
one 
of 
these 
rather 
than 
in 
another. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
outside 
of 
all. 
One 
objection 
might 
be 
made, 
if 
it 
were 
said 
that 
the 
number 
of 
these 
is 
boundless 
or 
none, 
or 
that 
it 
exceeds 
every 
number. 
But 
it 
can 
be 
disposed 
of, 
if 
we 
assume 
only 
some 
of 
these 
and 
ask 
why 
these 
exist, 
or 
if 
we 
posit 
more 
having 
something 
in 
common,forexampleexistingin 
thesameplace,whytheyexist 
inthis 
place. 


PROPOSITION 
9. 
The 
more 
reality 
or 
being 
a 
thing 
has 
the 
greater 
the 
number 
of 
its 
attributes. 
[He 
ought 
to 
have 
explained 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
reality 
or 
being, 
for 
these 
terms 
are 
liable 
to 
various, 
significations.] 
Demonstration: 
It 
is 
clear 
from 
Def. 
4. 
Thus 
the 
author. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
not 
to 
be 
clear 
from 
it. 
For 
one 
thing 
may 
have 
more 
of 
reality 
than 
another, 
as 
what 
is 
itself 
greater 
in 
its 
own 
kind, 
or 
has 
a 
greater 
part 
of 
some 
attribute; 
for 
example, 
a 
circle 
has 
more 
extension 
than 
the 
inscribed 
square. 
And 
still 
it 
may 
be 
doubted 
whether 
there 
are 
many 
attributes 
of 
the 
same 
substance, 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
author 
employs 
attributes. 
I 
confess, 
however, 
that 
if 
this 
be 
admitted 
and 
if 
it 
is 
posited 
that 
attributes 
are 
compatible, 
substance 
is 
more 
perfect 
accordingasithas 
more 
attributes. 


PROPOSITION 
10. 
Each 
particular 
attribute 
of 
the 
one 
substance 
must 
be 
conceived 
through 
itself, 
by 
Defs. 
4 
and 
3. 
But 
hence 
it 
follows, 
as 
I 
have 



several 
times 
urged, 
that 
there 
is 
but 
a 
single 
attribute 
of 
one 
substance, 
if 
it 
expressesthewhole 
essence. 


PROPOSITION 
11. 
God, 
or 
substance, 
consisting 
of 
infinite 
attributes, 
of 
which 
each 
expresses 
eternal 
and 
infinite 
essence, 
necessarily 
exists. 
He 
offers 
three 
demonstrations 
of 
this. 
First, 
because 
he 
is 
substance; 
therefore, 
by 
Prop. 
7, 
he 
exists. 
But 
in 
this 
he 
supposes 
both 
that 
substance 
necessarily 
exists, 
which, 
up 
to 
Prop. 
7, 
was 
not 
sufficiently 
demonstrated, 
and 
that 
God 
is 
a 
possible 
substance, 
which 
is 
not 
equally 
easy 
to 
demonstrate. 
Second. 
There 
must 
be 
a 
reason 
as 
well 
why 
a 
thing 
is 
as 
why 
it 
is 
not. 
But 
there 
can 
be 
no 
reason 
why 
God 
does 
not 
exist, 
not 
in 
his 
own 
nature 
for 
it 
does 
not 
involve 
a 
contradiction; 
not 
in 
another, 
for 
that 
other 
will 
either 
have 
the 
same 
nature 
and 
attribute, 
and 
hence 
will 
be 
God, 
or 
will 
not 
have 
them 
and 
hence 
will 
have 
nothing 
in 
common 
with 
God, 
and 
thus 
it 
can 
neither 
posit 
nor 
prevent 
his 
2 
existence. 
I 
reply, 
1st, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
proved 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
God 
does 
not 
involve 
a 
contradiction, 
although 
the 
author 
says 
it 
is 
absurd 
to 
assert, 
without 
proof, 
that 
it 
does. 
2d. 
There 
might 
be 
something 
having 
the 
same 
nature 
with 
God 
in 
some 
things, 
not 
in 
all. 
Third. 
Finite 
beings 
exist 
(by 
experience); 
therefore 
if 
the 
infinite 
does 
not 
exist 
there 
will 
be 
beings 
more 
powerful 
than 
the 
infinite 
being. 
It 
may 
be 
answered, 
if 
it 
implies 
anything, 
infinite 
being 
will 
have 
no 
power 
at 
all. 
I 
need 
say 
nothing 
oftheimproprietyof 
callingthepotentialityofexistenceapower. 


PROPOSITIONS 
12 
AND 
13. 
No 
attribute 
of 
substance 
can 
be 
conceived, 
from 
which 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
substance 
can 
be 
divided; 
or 
substance 
taken 
absolutely 
is 
indivisible. 
For 
it 
will 
be 
destroyed 
by 
division 
and 
the 
parts 
will 
not 
be 
infinite 
and 
hence 
not 
substances. 
Many 
substances 
of 
the 
same 
nature 
would 
be 
given. 
I 
grant 
it 
of 
a 
thing 
existing 
through 
itself. 
Hence 
the 
corollary 
follows 
that 
no 
substance, 
and 
therefore 
no 
corporeal 
substanceis 
divisible. 



PROPOSITION 
11. 
Besides 
God, 
no 
substance 
can 
be 
granted 
or 
conceived. 
Because 
all 
attributes 
belong 
to 
God, 
nor 
are 
several 
substances 
having 
thesame 
attribute 
given; 
therefore, 
no 
substancebesides 
God 
isgiven. 
All 
these 
suppose 
the 
definition 
of 
substance, 
namely, 
being 
which 
is 
conceived 
through 
itself, 
and 
many 
others 
noted 
above 
which 
are 
not 
to 
be 
admitted. 
[It 
does 
not 
yet 
seem 
certain 
to 
me 
that 
bodies 
are 
substances. 
It 
is

[This 
is

confusedly;

not

shown 
that

PROPOSITION

Whatever 
is, 
is 
in 
God, 
and 
without 
God 
nothing 
can 
be, 
or 
be 
conceived. 
For 
since 
there 
is 
no 
substance 
except 
God, 
Prop. 
14, 
so 
all 
other 
things 
will 
be 
modifications 
of 
God, 
or 
modes, 
since 
besides 
substances 
andmodesnothingis

[Againheomitsattributes.] 


PROPOSITION 
16. 
From 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
must 
follow 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
things 
in 
infinite 
ways;

is, 
all

which

COROLLARY 
1. 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
God 
is 
the

of 
all

COROLLARY

and 
is

COROLLARY 
1. 
Hence 
it 
follows, 
1st, 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
cause 
which, 
either 
extrinsically 
or 
intrinsically, 
besides 
the

of

moves

COROLLARY 
2. 
Godonly

In 
the 
SCHOLIUM 
he 
further 
explains 
that 
God 
created 
everything 
which 
is 
in 
his 
intellect 
(although, 
nevertheless, 
it 
seems 
that 
he 
has 
created 
only 
those 
which 
he 
wished). 
He 
says 
also 
that 
the 
intellect 
of 
God 
differs 
from 
our 
intellect 
in 
essence, 
and 
that, 
except 
equivocally, 
the 
name 
intellect 
cannot 
be 
attributed 
to 
both, 
just 
as 
the 
Dog, 
the 
heavenly 
constellation, 
and 
a 
dog, 
a 
barking 
animal, 
differ. 
The

in 
that

he 
differs 
from 
God 
as 
respects 
the

which 
hehas

PROPOSITION 
18. 
God 
is 
the 
immanent, 
not 
the 
transient 
cause 
of 
all 
things. 
From 
this 
it 
follows 
that 
God 
only 
is 
substance; 
other 
things 
are 
its 
modes. 


PROPOSITION 
19. 
God, 
or 
all 
his 
attributes 
are 
eternal. 
For 
his 
essence 
involves 
existence, 
and 
his 
attributes 
involve 
his 
essence. 
In 
addition, 
the 
author 
cites 
and 
approves 
the 
way 
in 
which 
he 
demonstrated 
this 
in 
Prop. 
19 
ofhis 
“Principles 
ofDescartes.” 


PROPOSITION 
20. 
The 
essence 
of 
God 
and 
his 
existence 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing. 
He 
proves 
all 
this 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
because 
eternal 
(by 
Prop. 
19), 
express 
existence 
(by 
the 
definition 
of 
eternity). 
But 
they 
also 
express 
essence, 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
attribute. 
Therefore 
essence 
and 
existence 
are 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
God. 
I 
answer 
that 
this 
does 
not 
follow, 
but 
only 
that 
they 
are 
expressed 
by 
the 
same. 
I 
note, 
moreover, 
that 
this 
proposition 
supposes 
the 
preceding, 
but 
if 
in 
place 
of 
the 
preceding 
proposition 
its 
demonstration 
be 
employed 
in 
the 
demonstration 
of 
this, 
a 
senselesscircumlocutionwillbe 
apparent. 
Thus: 



I 
prove 
that 
the 
essence 
and 
existence 
of 
God 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing, 
because 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
express 
both 
existence 
and 
essence. 
They 
express 
essence 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
attribute, 
they 
express 
existence 
because 
they 
are 
eternal; 
they 
are, 
moreover, 
eternal 
because 
they 
involve 
existence, 
for 
they 
express 
the 
essence 
of 
God 
which 
involves 
existence. 
What 
need 
is 
there, 
therefore, 
of 
mentioning 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
attributes 
and 
Prop. 
19, 
when 
the 
point 
merely 
is 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
existence 
and 
essence 
of 
God 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing, 
since 
the 
essence 
of 
God 
involves 
existence. 
The 
rest 
is 
pompously 
introduced 
that 
it 
may 
be 
fashioned 
into 
a 
sort 
of 
demonstration. 
Reasonings 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
exceedingly 
common 
with 
those 
whodo 
not 
possessthetrueartof

COROLLARY 
1. 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
God’s 
existence, 
like 
his 
essence, 
is 
an 
eternal 
truth. 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
this 
proposition 
follows 
from 
the 
preceding; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
far 
truer 
and 
clearer 
than 
the 
preceding. 
For 
it 
is 
immediately 
apparent 
when 
it 
is 
posited 
that 
the

of 
God 
involves 
existence,althoughitmaynotbeadmittedthattheyareoneand

PROPOSITION 
23. 
Every 
mode, 
which 
exists 
both 
necessarily 
and 
as 
infinite, 
must 
necessarily 
follow 
either 
from 
the 
absolute 
nature 
of 
some 
attribute 
of 
God, 
or 
from 
some 
attribute 
modified 
by 
a 
modification 
which 
exists 
necessarily, 
and 
as 
infinite. 
That 
is, 
such 
a 
mode 
follows 
from 
the 
absolute 
nature 
of 
some 
attribute 
either 
immediately 
or 
mediately 
through 
anothersuchmode. 


PROPOSITION 
24. 
The 
essence 
of 
things 
produced 
by 
God 
does 
not 
involve 
existence; 
otherwise, 
by 
Def. 
1, 
they 
would 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
themselves, 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
hypothesis. 
This 
from 
elsewhere 
is 
manifest; 
but 
this 
demonstration 
is 
a 
paralogism. 
For 
cause 
of 
itself, 
by 
his 
Def. 
1, 
has 
not 
retained 
its 
common 
meaning, 
but 
has 
received 
a 
peculiar 
one. 
Therefore 
the 
author 
cannot 
substitute 
the 
common 
meaning 
of 
the 
word 
for 
the 
peculiar 
one 
assumed 
by 
him 
at 
his 
will, 
unless 
he 
shows 
that 
they 
are 
equivalent. 
[Leibnitz 
has 
remarked 
on 
the 
margin 
of 
the 
manuscript: 
From 
this 
proposition 
it 
follows, 
contrary 
to 
Spinoza 
himself, 
that 
things 
are 
not 
necessary. 
For 
that 
is 
not 
necessary 
whose 
essence 
does 
not 
involve 
existence. 
— 
Gerhardt.] 


PROPOSITION 
25. 
God 
is 
the 
efficient 
cause 
not 
only 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
things 
but 
also 
of 
their 
essence. 
Otherwise 
the 
essence 
of 
things 
could 
be 
conceived 
without 
God, 
by 
Axiom 
4. 
But 
this 
proof 
is 
of 
no 
moment. 
For 
even 
if 
we 
concede 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
things 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
without 
God, 
from 
Prop. 
15, 
it 
does 
not 
therefore 
follow 
that 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
things. 
For 
the 
fourth 
axiom 
does 
not 
say 
this: 
That 
without 
which 
a 
thing 
cannot 
he 
conceived 
is 
its 
cause 
(which 
would 
indeed 
be 
false, 
for 
a 
circle 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
without 
a 
center, 
a 
line 
without 
a 
point, 
but 
the 
center 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
circle 
nor 
the 
point 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
line), 
but 
it 
says 
only 
this: 
Knowledge 
of 
the 
effect 
involves 
knowledge 
of 
the 
cause, 
which 
is 
quite 
different. 
For 
this 
axiom 
is 
not 
convertible; 
not 
to 
mention 
that 



to 
involve 
is 
one 
thing, 
not 
able 
to 
be 
conceived 
without 
it 
is 
another. 
Knowledge 
of 
a 
parabola 
involves 
in 
it 
knowledge 
of 
a 
focus, 
nevertheless 
it 
can 
beconceived 
withoutit. 


COROLLARY. 
Individual 
things 
are 
nothing 
but 
modifications 
of 
the 
attributes 
of 
God, 
or 
modes 
by 
which 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
are 
expressed 
in 
a 
fixed 
and 
definite 
manner. 
This, 
he 
says, 
is 
evident 
from 
Def. 
5 
and 
Prop. 
15, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
in 
what 
way 
the 
corollary 
is 
connected 
with 
this 
Prop. 


25. 
Certainly 
Spinoza 
is 
not 
a 
great 
master 
of 
demonstration. 
This 
corollary 
is 
sufficiently 
evident 
from 
what 
was 
said 
above; 
but 
it 
is 
true 
if 
it 
is 
understood 
in 
a 
right 
sense, 
not 
indeed 
that 
things 
are 
such 
modes, 
but 
modes 
of 
conceiving 
particular 
things 
are 
determinate 
modes 
of 
conceiving 
divine 
attributes. 
PROPOSITION 
28. 
Every 
individual 
thing, 
or 
everything 
which 
is 
finite 
and 
has 
a 
conditioned 
existence, 
cannot 
exist 
or 
be 
conditioned 
to 
act, 
unless 
it 
be 
conditioned 
for 
existence 
and 
action 
by 
a 
cause 
other 
than 
itself, 
which 
also 
is 
finite, 
and 
has 
a 
conditioned 
existence; 
and 
likewise 
this 
by 
another, 
and 
so 
on 
ad 
infinitum. 
Because 
nothing 
conditioned, 
finite 
and 
existing 
in 
a 
certain 
time, 
can 
follow 
from 
the 
absolute 
essence 
of 
God. 
From 
this 
opinion 
strictly 
taken 
many 
absurd 
consequences 
follow. 
For 
indeed 
things 
will 
not 
follow 
in 
this 
way 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
God. 
For 
the 
conditioning 
thing 
itself 
is 
again 
conditioned 
by 
another, 
and 
so 
on 
ad 
infinitum. 
In 
no 
way, 
therefore, 
are 
things 
determined 
by 
God. 
God 
only 
contributes 
of 
himself 
certain 
absolute 
and 
general 
things. 
It 
would 
be 
more 
correct 
to 
say, 
that 
one 
particular 
thing 
is 
not 
determined 
by 
another 
in 
a 
progression 
ad 
infinitum, 
for 
otherwise, 
indeed, 
they 
always 
remain 
indeterminate, 
however 
far 
you 
progress; 
but 
rather 
all 
particular 
things 
are 
determined 
by 
God. 
Nor 
are 
posterior 
things 
the 
full 
cause 
of 
prior 
things, 
but 
rather 
God 
creates 
posterior 
things 
sothat 
theyareconnected 
withtheprior,accordingto 
rules 
ofwisdom. 



If 
we 
say 
that 
prior 
things 
are 
the 
efficient 
causes 
of 
the 
posterior, 
the 
posteriorwillinturnbeinaway 
the 
final 
causesoftheprior, 
according 
tothe 
viewofthosewhoclaim 
thatGod 
operatesaccordingto 
ends. 


PROPOSITION 
29. 
Nothing 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
is 
contingent, 
but 
all 
things 
are 
conditioned 
to 
exist 
and 
operate 
in 
a 
particular 
manner 
by 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
divine 
nature. 
The 
demonstration 
is 
obscure 
and 
abrupt, 
deduced 
from 
preceding 
propositions 
abrupt, 
obscure 
and 
doubtful. 
It 
depends 
upon 
the 
definition 
of 
contingent, 
which 
he 
has 
nowhere 
given. 
I, 
with 
others, 
employ 
contingent 
for 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
which 
does 
not 
involve 
existence. 
In 
this 
meaning, 
particular 
things 
are 
contingent, 
according 
to 
Spinoza 
himself, 
by 
Prop. 
24. 
But 
if 
you 
employ 
contingent 
according 
to 
the 
custom 
of 
certain 
scholastics, 
a 
custom 
unknown 
to 
Aristotle 
and 
to 
other 
men 
and 
to 
the 
usage 
of 
life, 
for 
that 
which 
happens, 
so 
that 
a 
reason 
can 
in 
no 
way 
be 
given 
why 
it 
should 
occur 
thus 
rather 
than 
otherwise; 
the 
cause 
of 
which 
also, 
all 
the 
requisites 
as 
well 
within 
as 
without 
it 
having 
been 
posited, 
was 
equally 
disposed 
toward 
acting 
or 
not 
acting; 
I 
think 
that 
such 
a 
contingent 
implies 
that 
all 
things 
are 
by 
their 
nature, 
according 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
and 
the 
condition 
of 
things, 
certain 
and 
determinate, 
although 
unknown 
to 
us, 
and 
do 
not 
have 
their 
determination 
in 
themselves 
but 
through 
the 
supposition 
or 
hypothesis 
of 
things 
external 
to 
them. 


PROPOSITION 
30. 
Intellect, 
in 
action 
(actu) 
finite, 
or 
in 
action 
infinite, 
must 
comprehend 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
and 
the 
modifications 
of 
God, 
and 
nothing 
else. 
This 
proposition, 
which 
is 
sufficiently 
clear 
from 
the 
preceding 
and 
in 
a 
right 
sense 
true, 
our 
author 
according 
to 
his 
custom 
proves 
by 
others 
which 
are 
obscure, 
doubtful 
and 
remote; 
namely, 
that 
a 
true 
idea 
must 
agree 
with 
its 
ideate, 
that 
is, 
as 
known 
per 
se 
(so 
he 
says, 
although 
I 
do 
not 
see 
how 
what 
is 
known 
per 
se 
is 
any 
the 
more 
true); 
that 
what 
is 
contained 
in 
the 



intellect 
objectively 
must 
necessarily 
be 
granted 
in 
nature; 
that 
but 
one 
substance 
is 
given, 
namely, 
God. 
Nevertheless, 
these 
propositions 
are 
obscure, 
doubtful 
and 
far-fetched. 
The 
genius 
of 
the 
author 
seems’ 
to 
have 
been 
greatly 
distorted. 
He 
rarely 
proceeds 
by 
a 
clear 
and 
natural 
road; 
he 
always 
goes 
by 
an 
abrupt 
and 
circuitous 
one. 
And 
most 
of 
his 
demonstrations 
rather 
surprise 
(surprennent) 
themindthanenlightenit. 


PROPOSITION 
31. 
The 
intellect 
in 
action, 
whether 
finite 
or 
infinite, 
as 
will, 
desire, 
love, 
etc. 
should 
be 
referred 
to 
passive 
nature 
(natura 
naturata), 
not 
to 
active 
nature 
(natura 
naturans). 
He 
understands 
by 
active 
nature, 
God 
and 
his 
absolute 
attributes; 
by 
passive 
nature, 
his 
modes. 
But 
the 
intellect 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
a 
certain 
mode 
of 
thought. 
Hence 
elsewhere 
he 
says 
that 
Godproperlydoesnotknowor 
will. 
Ido 
notassenttothis. 


PROPOSITION 
32. 
Will 
cannot 
be 
called 
a 
free 
cause, 
but 
only 
a 
necessary 
cause, 
because, 
forsooth, 
that 
is 
free 
which 
is 
determined 
by 
itself. 
Thewill,moreover, 
isamode 
ofthoughtandsoismodifiedbyanother. 


PROPOSITION 
33. 
Things 
could 
have 
been 
produced 
by 
God 
in 
no 
other 
manner 
or 
order 
than 
that 
in 
which 
they 
have 
been 
produced. 
For 
they 
follow 
from 
the 
immutable 
nature 
of 
God. 
This 
proposition 
is 
true 
or 
false 
according 
as 
it 
is 
explained. 
On 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
a 
divine 
will 
choosing 
the 
best 
or 
operating 
most 
perfectly, 
certainly 
nothing 
but 
these 
could 
have 
been 
produced;but 
accordingtothe 
nature 
of 
things 
regarded 
in 
themselves, 
things 
might 
have 
been 
produced 
otherwise. 
Just 
as 
we 
say 
that 
the 
angels 
confirmed 
[in 
holiness] 
cannot 
sin, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
liberty; 
they 
can 
if 
they 
will 
but 
they 
do 
not 
will. 
They 
may 
be 
able, 
absolutely 
speaking, 
to 
will 
it, 
but 
in 
this 
existing 
state 
of 
affairs 
they 
are 
not 
able 
to 
will 
it. 
The 
author 
rightly 
acknowledges 
in 
the 
scholium 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
rendered 
impossible 
in 
two 
ways, 
either 
because 
it 
implies 
it 
in 
itself 
or 
because 
no 
external 
cause 
is 
given 
suitable 
for 
producing 
it. 
In 
the 
second 
scholium 
he 
denies 
that 
God 



does 
all 
things 
with 
the 
Good 
in 
view 
(sub 
rations 
boni). 
He 
certainly 
has 
denied 
to 
him 
will, 
and 
he 
thinks 
that 
those 
differing 
from 
him 
subject 
God 
to 
fate, 
although 
nevertheless 
he 
himself 
confesses 
that 
God 
does 
all 
things 
by 
reasonofthe 
Perfect 
(sub 
rations 
perfecti). 


PROPOSITION 
34. 
God’s 
power 
is 
his 
very 
essence, 
because 
it 
follows 
fromthenatureofessence 
thatheisthecause 
ofhimselfand 
ofotherthings. 


PROPOSITION 
35. 
Whatever 
exists 
in 
the 
power 
of 
God 
exists 
necessarily;that 
is,followsfrom 
his 
essence. 


PROPOSITION 
36. 
Nothing 
exists 
from 
whose 
nature 
some 
effect 
does 
not 
follow, 
because 
it 
expresses 
the 
nature 
of 
God 
in 
a 
certain 
and 
determined 
mode; 
that 
is, 
by 
Prop. 
34, 
the 
power 
of 
God 
[it 
does 
not 
follow, 
but 
it 
is 
neverthelesstrue]. 


He 
adds 
an 
APPENDIX 
against 
those 
who 
think 
that 
God 
acts 
with 
an 
end 
in 
view, 
mingling 
true 
with 
false. 
For 
although 
it 
may 
be 
true 
that 
all 
things 
do 
not 
happen 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
man, 
nevertheless 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
God 
actswithoutwillorwithoutknowledgeofgood. 


Inthecopyof 
Spinoza’s 
Opera 
Posthuma,nowcontainedintheroyallibrary 
atHanover,Leibnitz 
haswritten 
thefollowing 
notes: 


PART 
SECOND 
OFTHE 
“ETHICS.” 


On 
Def. 
4, 
“By 
an 
adéquats 
idea, 
I 
mean 
an 
idea 
which, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
considered 
in 
itself, 
without 
relation 
to 
the 
object 
has 
all 
the 
properties 
or 
intrinsic 
marks 
of 
a 
true 
idea,” 
Leibnitz 
writes: 
He 
had 
therefore 
to 
explain 
what 
a 
trueideais,for 
Part 
I, 
Axiom 
1,itis 
employed 
onlyas 
agreement 
with 
itsideate. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Proof 
of 
Prop. 
1, 
“Thought 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
God 
or 
God 
is 
a 
thinking 
thing,” 
Leibnitz 
adds: 
In 
the 
same 
way 
he 
will 
prove 
that 
God 



fearsand 
hopes. 
If 
you 
replythattheyaremodesofthought, 
it 
can 
perhapsbe 
said 
thatthoughtis 
amodeof 
another 
attribute. 


OnProp. 
6, 
“Themodesofanygivenattributearecausedby 
God,insofar 
as 
he 
is 
considered 
through 
the 
attribute 
of 
which 
they 
are 
modes, 
and 
not 
in 
so 
far 
as 
he 
is 
considered 
through 
any 
other 
attribute.” 
Leibnitz 
remarks: 
I 
doubt 
it, 
because 
it 
seems 
that 
something 
besides 
is 
required 
for 
modifying 
any 
attribute. 
The 
reason 
is 
the 
same 
with 
that 
which 
concludes 
that 
not 
all 
exist;onthecontrary,thatcertaindistinctonesexist. 


On 
Prop. 
12, 
a 
Whatever 
comes 
to 
pass 
in 
the 
object 
of 
the 
idea, 
which 
constitutes 
the 
human 
mind, 
must 
be 
perceived 
by 
the 
human 
mind, 
or 
there 
will 
necessarily 
be 
an 
idea 
in 
the 
human 
mind 
of 
this 
occurrence. 
That 
is, 
if 
the 
object 
of 
the 
idea 
constituting 
the 
human 
mind 
be 
a 
body, 
nothing 
can 
take 
place 
in 
that 
body 
without 
being 
perceived 
by 
the 
mind,” 
is 
written: 
Ideas 
do 
not 
act. 
The 
mind 
acts. 
The 
whole 
world 
is 
indeed 
the 
object 
of 
each 
mind. 
The 
whole 
world 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
is 
perceived 
by 
any 
mind 
whatever. 
The 
world 
is 
one, 
and 
nevertheless 
minds 
are 
diverse. 
Therefore 
the 
mind 
is 
made 
not 
through 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
body, 
but 
because 
GOD 
in 
various 
ways 
intuitestheworld 
asIdoacity. 


To 
Prop. 
13, 
“The 
object 
of 
the 
idea 
constituting 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
the 
body; 
in 
other 
words, 
a 
certain 
mode 
of 
extension 
which 
actually 
exists, 
and 
nothing 
else,” 
Leibnitz 
adds: 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
some 
mind 
is 
momentarily,atleast, 
inthesameman. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Proof 
to 
Prop. 
15, 
“The 
idea 
which 
constitutes 
the 
actual 
being 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
is 
not 
simple, 
but 
compounded 
of 
a 
great 
number 
of 
ideas,” 
he 
remarks: 
Therefore, 
also, 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
an

On 
Prop. 
20, 
“The

of

is 
also

God,

in

he 
writes: 
Therefore 
the

of

Hence 
it 
would

that

On 
the 
words

to

21, 
“That

mind

body 
are 
one 
and 
the

individual, 
conceived 
now 
under 
the 
attribute 
of 
thought, 
now 
under 
the 
attribute 
of 
extension,” 
he 
remarks: 
Therefore, 
in 
fact, 
mind 
and 
body 
do 
not 
differ 
any 
more 
than 
a 
city 
regarded 
in 
different 
ways 
differs 
from 
itself. 
It 
follows 
that 
extension 
does 
not 
in 
fact 
differ 
from 
thought, 
ατοπα. 


At 
the 
end 
of 
this 
scholium 
Leibnitz 
adds: 
Hence 
it 
follows 
that 
to 
understand

On 
Prop. 
23, 
“The

except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
perceives

he 
writes: 
If 
the 
mind

whatsoever, 
it 
follows 
that

THOUGHTS 
ON 
KNOWLEDGE, 
TRUTH 
AND 
IDEAS. 


[FromtheLatin. 
ActaEruditorum 
Lipsiensium, 
Nov. 
1684.] 



SINCE 
EMINENT 
MEN 
are 
to-day 
raisingdiscussions 
concerning 
true 
and 
false 
ideas, 
and 
since 
this 
subject, 
which 
even 
Descartes 
has 
not 
always 
satisfactorily 
explained, 
is 
of 
the 
greatest 
importance 
for 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
I 
propose 
to 
explain 
in 
a 
few 
words, 
what, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
may 
he 
said 
with 
certainty 
regarding 
the 
distinctions 
and 
the 
criteria 
of 
our 
ideas 
and 
of 
our 
knowledge. 
Thus 
knowledge 
is 
either 
obscure 
or 
clear, 
and 
clear 
knowledge 
is 
farther 
either 
confused 
or 
distinct, 
and 
distinct 
knowledge 
is 
either 
inadequate 
or 
adequate, 
or 
again, 
symbolical 
or 
intuitive; 
and 
if 
it 
is 
at 
thesametime 
symbolical 
and 
intuitive, 
itisperfectin 
every 
respect. 


A 
notion 
is 
obscure 
when 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
enable 
us 
to 
recognize 
the 
thing 
represented; 
as 
for 
example, 
where 
I 
should 
have 
some 
vague 
idea 
of 
a 
dower 
or 
of 
an 
animal 
which 
I 
should 
have 
already 
seen 
but 
not 
sufficiently 
to 
be 
able 
to 
recognize 
it 
if 
offered 
to 
my 
sight, 
nor 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
some 
neighboring 
animal; 
or 
where 
I 
should 
consider 
some 
term 
badly 
defined 
in 
the 
schools, 
such 
as 
the 
entelechy 
of 
Aristotle, 
or 
cause 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
common 
to 
matter, 
to 
form, 
to 
efficient 
cause, 
or 
to 
end, 
and 
other 
expressions 
of 
which 
we 
have 
no 
fixed 
definition; 
this 
renders 
the 
proposition 
of 
which 
such 
a 
notion 
forms 
part 
equally 
obscure. 
Knowledge 
then 
is 
clear 
when 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
enable 
me 
to 
recognize 
the 
thing 
represented, 
and 
it 
is 
farther 
either 
confused 
or 
distinct; 
confused, 
when 
I 
cannot 
enumerate 
separately 
the 
marks 
necessary 
to 
distinguish 
one 
thing 
from 
others, 
notwithstanding 
that 
the 
object 
has 
in 
reality 
such 
marks, 
as 
well 
as 
data 
requisite 
to 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
notion. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
we 
recognize 
clearly 



enough, 
colors, 
odors, 
flavors 
and 
other 
particular 
objects 
of 
the 
senses, 
and 
that 
we 
distinguish 
the 
one 
from 
the 
other 
by 
the 
simple 
testimony 
of 
the 
senses 
and 
not 
by 
enunciable 
signs. 
This 
is 
why 
we 
cannot 
explain 
to 
a 
blind 
person 
what 
red 
is, 
nor 
can 
we 
make 
other 
people 
recognize 
qualities 
of 
this 
kind 
except 
by 
placing 
them 
in 
direct 
communication 
with 
them, 
that 
is, 
by 
making 
them 
see, 
smell 
and 
taste, 
or 
at 
least 
by 
recalling 
to 
them 
a 
certain 
sensation 
which 
they 
have 
already 
experienced; 
and 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
notions 
of 
these 
qualities 
are 
composite 
and 
may 
be 
analyzed, 
because 
they 
have 
their 
causes. 
Just 
so 
we 
often 
see 
painters 
or 
other 
artists 
who 
judge 
very 
correctly 
that 
a 
work 
is 
good 
or 
defective, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
account 
for 
their 
judgment, 
and 
who 
reply 
to 
those 
who 
ask 
their 
opinion, 
that 
that 
of 
which 
they 
disapprove, 
lacks 
somethings, 
I 
know 
not 
what. 
But 
a 
distinct 
notion 
resembles 
that 
which 
the 
assayers 
have 
of 
gold, 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
distinctive 
signs 
and 
of 
means 
of 
comparison 
sufficient 
to 
distinguish 
the 
object 
from 
all 
other 
similar 
bodies. 
Such 
are 
the 
means 
of 
which 
we 
make 
use 
for 
notions 
common 
to 
several 
senses, 
such 
as 
those 
of 
number, 
of 
magnitude 
and 
of 
figure, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
many 
affections 
of 
the 
mind, 
such 
as 
hope 
and 
fear: 
in 
a 
word, 
for 
all 
the 
objects 
of 
which 
we 
have 
a 
nominal 
definition, 
which 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
an 
enumeration 
of 
sufficient 
distinctive 
marks. 
We 
have 
however 
a 
distinct 
knowledge 
of 
an 
indefinable 
thing 
when 
it 
is 
primitive, 
or 
when 
it 
is 
only 
the 
mark 
of 
itself 
— 
that 
is, 
when 
it 
is 
irreducible 
and 
is 
only 
understood 
through 
itself, 
and 
consequently 
does 
not 
possess 
the 
requisite 
marks. 
As 
for 
composite 
notions 
where 
each 
of 
the 
component 
marks 
is 
sometimes 
clearly 
known, 
although 
in 
a 
confused 
way, 
as 
gravity, 
color, 
aqua 
fortis, 
which 
form 
a 
part 
of 
those 
[the 
marks] 
of 
gold, 
it 
follows 
that 
such 
a 
knowledge 
of 
gold 
is 
distinct 
without 
always 
being 
adequate. 
But 
when 
all 
the 
elements 
of 
a 
distinct 
notion 
are 
themselves 
also 
known 
distinctly, 
or 
when 
its 
analysis 
is 
complete, 
the 
idea 
is 
adequate. 
I 
do 



not 
know 
that 
men 
can 
give 
a 
perfect 
example 
of 
this, 
although 
the 
knowledge 
of 
numbers 
approaches 
it 
very 
nearly. 
It 
very 
often 
happens, 
nevertheless, 
especially 
in 
a 
long 
analysis, 
that 
we 
do 
not 
perceive 
the 
whole 
nature 
of 
the 
object 
at 
one 
time, 
but 
substitute 
in 
place 
of 
the 
things, 
signs, 
the 
explanation 
of 
which, 
in 
any 
present 
thought, 
we 
are 
accustomed 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
abbreviation 
to 
omit, 
knowing 
or 
believing 
that 
we 
can 
give 
it; 
thus 
when 
I 
think 
a 
chiliogon, 
or 
polygon 
with 
a 
thousand 
equal 
sides, 
I 
do 
not 
always 
consider 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
side, 
of 
equality, 
and 
of 
the 
number 
thousand 
(or 
of 
the 
cube 
of 
ten); 
but 
these 
words, 
the 
sense 
of 
which 
presents 
itself 
to 
my 
mind 
in 
an 
obscure, 
or 
at 
least 
imperfect 
manner, 
take 
the 
place 
to 
me 
of 
the 
ideas 
which 
I 
have 
of 
them, 
because 
my 
memory 
attests 
to 
me 
that 
I 
know 
the 
signification 
of 
these 
words, 
and 
that 
their 
explanation 
is 
not 
now 
necessary 
for 
any 
judgment. 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
call 
this 
thought 
blind 
or 
again 
symbolical; 
and 
we 
make 
use 
of 
it 
in 
algebra, 
in 
arithmetic 
and 
almost 
everywhere. 
And 
assuredly 
when 
a 
question 
is 
very 
complex, 
we 
cannot 
embrace 
in 
thought 
at 
the 
same 
time 
all 
the 
elementary 
notions 
which 
compose 
it; 
but 
when 
this 
can 
be 
done, 
or 
at 
least 
as 
far 
as 
this 
can 
be 
done, 
I 
call 
this 
thought 
intuitive. 
We 
can 
only 
have 
an 
intuitive 
knowledge 
of 
a 
distinct, 
primitive 
notion, 
as 
most 
often 
we 
have 
only 
a 
symbolical 
knowledge 
ofcompositeideas. 


From 
this 
it 
clearly 
follows 
that 
even 
of 
the 
things 
which 
we 
know 
distinctly, 
we 
only 
conceive 
the 
ideas 
in 
as 
far 
as 
they 
form 
the 
object 
of 
intuitive 
thought. 
Also 
it 
often 
happens 
that 
we 
imagine 
that 
we 
have 
in 
our 
minds 
the 
ideas 
of 
things, 
from 
supposing 
wrongly 
that 
we 
have 
already 
explained 
to 
ourselves 
the 
terms 
of 
which 
we 
make 
use. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
true, 
as 
some 
say, 
or 
at 
least 
it 
is 
very 
uncertain, 
that 
we 
cannot 
speak 
of 
anything, 
understanding 
fully 
what 
we 
say, 
without 
having 
an 
idea 
of 
it. 
For 
often 
we 
vaguely 
understand 
each 
of 
these 
terms 
or 
we 
remember 
that 
we 
have 



formerly 
understood 
them; 
but 
as 
we 
content 
ourselves 
with 
this 
blind 
thought 
and 
as 
we 
do 
not 
push 
far 
enough 
the 
analysis 
of 
notions, 
it 
happens 
that 
unwittingly 
we 
fall 
into 
the 
contradiction 
which 
the 
composite 
idea 
may 
imply. 
I 
have 
been 
led 
to 
examine 
this 
question 
more 
closely 
by 
an 
argument, 
long 
celebrated 
in 
the 
schools 
and 
renewed 
by 
Descartes, 
for 
proving 
the 
existence 
of 
God. 
It 
is 
as 
follows: 
All 
that 
follows 
from 
the 
idea 
or 
from 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
thing 
may 
be 
affirmed 
of 
the 
thing 
itself. 
From 
the 
idea 
of 
Ron 
(or 
the 
most 
perfect 
being, 
or 
one 
a 
greater 
than 
whom 
cannot 
be 
conceived), 
existence 
follows. 
(For 
the 
most 
perfect 
being 
involvesall 
perfections, 
among 
which 
is 
also 
existence). 
Therefore 
existence 
may 
be 
affirmed 
of 
GOD. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
known 
how 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
if 
God 
be 
possible, 
it 
follows 
that 
he 
exists. 
For 
to 
conclude, 
we 
cannot 
safely 
use 
definitions 
before 
knowing 
whether 
they 
are 
real 
and 
do 
not 
involve 
any 
contradiction. 
The 
reason 
of 
this 
Is, 
that 
if 
the 
ideas 
involve 
contradiction, 
opposite 
things 
may 
be 
concluded 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
which 
is 
absurd. 
I 
am 
accustomed, 
in 
order 
to 
render 
this 
truth 
clear, 
to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
example 
of 
quickest 
motion, 
which 
involves 
an 
absurdity. 
Suppose 
then 
that 
a 
wheel 
turn 
with 
the 
quickest 
motion, 
who 
does 
not 
see 
that 
a 
spoke 
prolonged 
will 
move 
more 
rapidly 
at 
its 
extremity 
than 
at 
the 
center 
of 
the 
circumference; 
therefore 
the 
motion 
is 
not 
the 
quickest, 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
hypothesis. 
However 
it 
seems 
at 
first 
view, 
as 
if 
we 
might 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
quickest 
motion, 
for 
we 
understand 
fully 
what 
we 
say, 
and 
yet 
we 
cannot 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
impossible 
things. 
So 
it 
does 
not 
suffice 
that 
we 
think 
the 
most 
perfect 
being, 
to 
assure 
us 
that 
we 
have 
the 
idea 
of 
such 
a 
being, 
and 
in 
the 
demonstration 
which 
we 
have 
just 
produced, 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
being 
must 
be 
shown 
or 
supposed, 
if 
the 
conclusion 
be 
legitimately 
drawn. 
However 
it 
is 
very 
true 
both 
that 
we 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
(TOD, 
and 
that 
the 
most 
perfect 
being 
is 
possible, 
and 
even 



necessary; 
but 
the 
argument 
is 
not 
conclusive 
and 
has 
already 
been 
rejected 
byThomasAquinas. 


Anditis 
thusthatwe 
findadifference 
betweennominaldefinitions, 
which 
only 
contain 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
thing 
which 
is 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
others, 
and 
real 
definitions 
which 
show 
clearly 
that 
the 
thing 
is 
possible. 
And 
in 
this 
way 
answer 
is 
made 
to 
Hobbes, 
who 
pretended 
that 
truths 
were 
arbitrary, 
because 
they 
depended 
on 
nominal 
definitions, 
not 
considering 
that 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
definition 
is 
independent 
of 
arbitrariness, 
and 
that 
notions 
are 
not 
always 
reconcilable 
among 
themselves. 
Nominal 
definitions 
are 
only 
sufficient 
to 
a 
perfect 
science 
when 
it 
is 
well 
established 
otherwise 
that 
the 
thing 
defined 
is 
possible. 
It 
is 
very 
evident 
also 
what 
a 
true 
idea 
is, 
what 
a 
false; 
the 
idea 
is 
true 
when 
the 
notion 
is 
possible; 
it 
is 
false 
when 
the 
notion 
involves 
contradiction. 
Now 
we 
know 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
thing 
either 
a 
priori 
or 
a 
posteriori. 
A 
priori, 
when 
we 
resolve 
the 
notion 
into 
its 
elements, 
or 
into 
other 
notions 
of 
known 
possibility, 
and 
when 
we 
know 
that 
it 
includes 
nothing 
which 
is 
incompatible; 
and, 
to 
cite 
but 
one 
case, 
this 
takes 
place 
when 
we 
understand 
by 
what 
means 
a 
thing 
may 
be 
produced, 
a 
fact 
which 
makes 
causal 
definitions 
more 
useful 
than 
any 
others: 
a 
posteriori, 
when 
experienceshowsusthethingactuallyexisting; 
for 
thatwhichexists 
infactis 
necessarily 
possible. 
Every 
time 
that 
we 
have 
an 
adequate 
knowledge, 
we 
have 
also 
knowledge 
of 
the 
possibility 
a 
priori; 
for 
if 
we 
push 
the 
analysis 
to 
the 
end 
and 
no 
contradiction 
appears, 
the 
notion 
is 
necessarily 
possible. 
Now, 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
men 
should 
ever 
construct 
a 
perfect 
analysis 
of 
notions, 
or 
that 
they 
should 
reduce 
their 
thoughts 
down 
to 
first 
possibilities 
to 
irreducible 
notions, 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
down 
to 
the 
absolute 
attributes 
of 
God; 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
first 
causes 
and 
to 
the 
final 
reason 
of 
things? 
I 
should 
not 
dare 
to 
actually 
decide 
this 
question. 
Most 
often 
we 
content 
ourselves 
with 



learning 
fromexperiencetherealityof 
certain 
notions,fromwhichafterwards 
wecomposeothers,aftertheexampleofnature. 


Whence 
I 
think 
it 
may 
be 
understood 
that 
it 
is 
not 
always 
safe 
to 
appeal 
to 
ideas, 
and 
that 
many 
abuse 
this 
specious 
title 
for 
establishing 
certain 
imaginations 
of 
their 
own. 
For 
we 
have 
not 
always 
immediately 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
thing 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious 
of 
thinking, 
as 
we 
have 
shown 
above 
in 
the 
example 
of 
greatest 
swiftness. 
And 
I 
see 
that 
none 
the 
less 
to-day 
do 
men 
abuse 
this 
famous 
principle: 
Everything 
that 
I 
conceive 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
true 
or 
may 
he 
predicated 
of 
it. 
For 
often 
men, 
judging 
hastily, 
imagine 
things 
clear 
and 
distinct 
which 
are 
obscure 
and 
confused. 
The 
axiom 
is 
therefore 
useless 
unless 
the 
criteria 
of 
clearness 
and 
distinctness, 
which 
we 
have 
indicated 
be 
applied, 
and 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
ideas 
be 
well 
established. 
As 
for 
the 
rest, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
in 
the 
exposition 
of 
truth 
to 
reject 
as 
criteria 
the 
rules 
of 
ordinary 
logic 
of 
which 
geometricians 
make 
use 
and 
which 
consist 
in 
admitting 
nothing 
as 
certain 
which 
is 
not 
proved 
by 
exact 
experience 
or 
solid 
demonstration. 
Now 
a 
solid 
demonstration 
is 
one 
which 
observes 
the 
form 
prescribed 
by 
logic, 
without, 
however, 
always 
having 
need 
of 
syllogisms 
disposed 
in 
the 
regular 
order 
of 
the 
schools 
(like 
those 
of 
which 
Christianus 
Herlinus 
and 
Conradus 
Dasypodius 
made 
use 
for 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
first 
six 
books 
of 
Euclid); 
but 
at 
least 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
reasoning 
is 
conclusive 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
form 
— 
an 
example 
of 
such 
reasoning 
conceived 
in 
the 
regular 
form 
may 
be 
found 
in 
any 
legitimate 
calculus. 
Thus 
no 
necessary 
premise 
will 
be 
omitted, 
and 
all 
the 
previous 
premises 
must 
be 
either 
proved 
or 
at 
least 
admitted 
as 
hypotheses, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
conclusion 
is 
hypothetical. 
Those 
who 
will 
carefully 
observe 
these 
miles 
will 
easily 
guard 
themselves 
from 
deceptive 
ideas. 
It 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
such 
principles 
that 
the 
great 
genius, 
Pascal, 
in 
an 
excellent 
dissertation 
on 
the 
Mathematical 
Genius 
(a 
fragment 
of 
which 
exists 
in 
the 
remarkable 



book 
of 
the 
celebrated 
Antoine 
Arnauld, 
On 
the 
Art 
of 
Thinking 
Well), 
says 
that 
the 
geometrician 
must 
define 
all 
terms 
in 
the 
least 
obscure 
and 
prove 
all 
truthsintheleastdoubtful. 
ButIwishhehaddefinedthelimits 
beyondwhich 
a 
notion 
or 
an 
affirmation 
is 
no 
longer 
in 
the 
least 
obscure 
or 
doubtful. 
However, 
we 
may 
judge 
what 
there 
is 
in 
it 
by 
an 
attentive 
examination 
of 
the 
considerationswhich 
we 
havejust 
mentioned,fornowIwishtobe 
brief. 


As 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
we 
see 
all 
things 
in 
God 
(an 
old 
opinion, 
too, 
which 
reasonably 
understood 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
altogether 
rejected), 
or 
whether 
we 
have 
ideas 
of 
our 
own, 
it 
must 
be 
understood 
that 
even 
if 
we 
see 
all 
things 
in 
God 
it 
is 
none 
the 
less 
necessary 
that 
we 
have 
also 
ideas 
of 
our 
own; 
that 
is, 
not 
as 
it 
were 
certain 
little 
images, 
but 
affections 
or 
modifications 
of 
our 
mind, 
answering 
to 
that 
which 
we 
perceiveinGod. 
For 
sinceour 
thoughts 
are 
constantly 
being 
succeeded 
by 
others, 
a 
certain 
change 
is 
wrought 
in 
our 
mind; 
as 
for 
the 
things 
not 
actually 
conceived 
by 
us, 
ideas 
of 
them 
are 
in 
our 
mind 
as 
the 
statue 
of 
Hercules 
in 
the 
rough 
marble. 
But 
with 
God, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
must 
necessarily 
exist 
in 
actuality 
the 
idea 
not 
only 
of 
absolute 
and 
infinite 
extension, 
but 
also 
of 
each 
figure, 
which 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
modification 
of 
absolute 
extension. 
Moreover, 
when 
we 
perceive 
colors 
and 
odors 
we 
have 
no 
other 
perception 
but 
that 
of 
figures 
and 
motions, 
but 
so 
multiplex 
and 
delicate 
that 
our 
mind, 
in 
its 
present 
state, 
is 
incapable 
of 
distinctly 
considering 
each 
one 
and 
consequently 
it 
does 
not 
notice 
that 
the 
perception 
is 
only 
composed 
of 
extremely 
small 
figures 
and 
motions. 
So 
when, 
after 
having 
mixed 
yellow 
powder 
with 
blue 
we 
perceive 
a 
green 
color, 
we 
do 
not 
perceive 
anything 
but 
the 
yellow 
and 
blue 
minutely 
mixed, 
although 
we 
do 
not 
notice 
it, 
or 
rather 
imagine 
that 
we 
perceive 
some 
new 
entity. 



EXTRACTFROM 
A 
LETTER 
TO 
BAYLE, 
CONCERNING 


A 
GENERAL 
PRINCIPLEUSEFUL 
IN 
THE 
EXPLANATION 
OF 
THE 
LAWS 
OFNATURE. 
1687. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



I 
HAVE 
SEEN 
the 
reply 
of 
Malebranche 
to 
the 
remark 
which 
I 
made 
concerning 
certain 
laws 
of 
nature 
which 
he 
had 
established 
in 
the 
Search 
after 
Truth. 
He 
seems 
sufficiently 
disposed 
to 
abandon 
them 
himself, 
and 
this 
ingenuousness 
is 
highly 
praiseworthy; 
but 
as 
he 
gives 
reasons 
and 
restrictions, 
which 
would 
land 
us 
in 
the 
obscurity 
from 
which 
I 
think 
I 
have 
relieved 
this 
subject, 
and 
which 
clash 
with 
a 
certain 
principle 
of 
general 
order 
which 
I 
have 
observed, 
I 
hope 
that 
he 
will 
have 
the 
kindness 
to 
permit 
me 
to 
avail 
myself 
of 
the 
present 
opportunity 
to 
explain 
this 
principle, 
which 
is 
of 
great 
use 
in 
reasoning 
and 
which 
I 
think 
is 
not 
yet 
sufficiently 
employed 
nor 
sufficiently 
known 
in 
all 
its 
bearing. 
It 
takes 
its 
origin 
from 
the 
infinite; 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
in 
geometry 
but 
it 
holds 
good 
also 
in 
physics, 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
the 
sovereign 
wisdom 
which 
is 
the 
source 
of 
all 
things 
acts 
as 
a 
perfect 
geometrician, 
and 
according 
to 
a 
harmony 
to 
which 
nothing 
can 
be 
added. 
This 
is 
why 
this 
principle 
often 
serves 
as 
proof 
or 
test 
to 
show 
at 
first 
sight 
and 
from 
without, 
the 
error 
of 
a 
badly 
constructed 
opinion, 
even 
before 
coming 
to 
the 
discussion 
of 
the 
matter 
itself. 
It 
may 
be 
stated 
thus: 
When 
the 
difference 
of 
two 
cases 
may 
be 
diminished 
below 
any 
magnitude 
given 
in 
datis 
or 
in 
that 
which 
is 
posited, 
it 
must 
also 
be 
found 
diminished 
below 
any 
magnitude 
given 
in 
quaesitis 
or 
in 
that 
which 
results 
therefrom. 
Or 
to 
express 
it 
more 
familiarly, 
when 
the 
cases 
(or 
that 
which 
is 
given), 
continually 
approach 
each 
other 
and 
finally 
lose 
themselves 
one 
in 
the 
other, 
the 
results 



or 
events 
(or 
that 
which 
is 
required), 
must 
also 
do 
the 
same. 
This 
depends 
again 
on 
a 
more 
general 
principle, 
to 
wit: 
datis 
ordinatis 
etiani 
quaesita 
sunt 
ordinata. 
Butinordertounderstandit 
examples 
are 
necessary. 


It 
is 
known 
that 
the 
case 
or 
the 
supposition 
of 
an 
illipse 
may 
approach 
the 
case 
of 
a 
parabola 
as 
much 
as 
may 
be, 
so 
that 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
illipse 
and 
of 
the 
parabola 
may 
become 
less 
than 
any 
given 
difference, 
provided 
that 
one 
of 
the 
foci 
of 
the 
illipse 
be 
sufficiently 
distant 
from 
the 
other, 
for 
then 
the 
radii 
coming 
from 
this 
distant 
focus 
will 
differ 
from 
the 
parallel 
radii 
as 
little 
as 
may 
be, 
and 
consequently 
all 
the 
geometrical 
theorems 
which 
are 
true 
of 
the 
illipse 
in 
general 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
parabola 
by 
considering 
the 
latter 
as 
an 
illipse, 
one 
of 
the 
foci 
of 
which 
is 
infinitely 
distant, 
or 
(to 
avoid 
this 
expression), 
as 
a 
figure 
which 
differs 
from 
some 
illipse 
less 
than 
any 
given 
difference. 
The 
same 
principle 
holds 
good 
in 
physics; 
for 
example, 
rest 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
an 
infinitely 
small 
velocity, 
or 
as 
an 
infinite 
slowness. 
This 
is 
why 
all 
that 
is 
true 
in 
respect 
to 
slowness 
or 
velocity 
in 
general, 
must 
be 
true 
also 
of 
rest 
thus 
understood; 
so 
much 
so 
that 
the 
rule 
of 
rest 
ought 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
particular 
case 
of 
the 
rule 
of 
motion; 
otherwise, 
if 
this 
does 
not 
hold, 
it 
will 
be 
a 
sure 
sign 
that 
the 
rules 
are 
badly 
contrived. 
So 
equality 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
an 
infinitely 
small 
inequality, 
and 
inequality 
may 
be 
madetoapproach 
equalityas 
muchasyou 
please. 


It 
is 
among 
other 
faults 
of 
this 
consideration 
that 
Descartes, 
very 
able 
man 
as 
he 
was, 
failed 
in 
more 
than 
one 
way 
in 
his 
pretended 
laws 
of 
nature. 
For 
(not 
to 
repeat 
here 
what 
I 
said 
before 
of 
the 
other 
source 
of 
his 
error, 
when 
he 
took 
the 
quantity 
of 
movement 
for 
force), 
his 
first 
and 
his 
second 
rules, 
for 
example, 
do 
not 
agree; 
the 
second 
says 
that 
two 
bodies, 
B 
and 
C, 
meeting 
in 
the 
same 
line 
with 
equal 
velocities, 
and 
B 
being 
as 
little 
as 
possible 
larger, 
C 
will 
be 
turned 
back 
with 
its 
first 
velocity, 
but 
B 
will 
continue 
its 
movement; 
whereas 
according 
to 
the 
first 
rule, 
B 
and 
C 
being 
equal, 
both 
will 
turn 
back 



and 
retrograde 
with 
a 
velocity 
equal 
to 
that 
which 
had 
carried 
them 
thither. 
But 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
results 
of 
these 
two 
cases 
is 
not 
reasonable; 
for 
the 
inequalityofthetwo 
bodiesmay 
beasslightasyouplease,and 
the 
difference 
which 
is 
in 
the 
suppositions 
of 
these 
two 
cases, 
to 
wit: 
the 
difference 
between 
such 
an 
inequality 
and 
a 
perfect 
equality 
could 
be 
less 
than 
any 
given; 
hence, 
by 
virtue 
of 
our 
principle, 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
results 
or 
outcomes 
ought 
also 
to 
be 
less 
than 
any 
given; 
notwithstanding 
if 
the 
second 
rule 
were 
as 
true 
as 
the 
first 
the 
contrary 
would 
happen, 
for 
according 
to 
this 
second 
rule 
any 
increase, 
however 
small, 
of 
body 
B 
before 
equal 
to 
C, 
makes 
a 
difference 
grandissime 
in 
the 
effect, 
such 
that 
it 
changes 
absolute 
retrogression 
into 
absolute 
continuation, 
which 
is 
a 
great 
leap 
from 
one 
extremity 
to 
the 
other, 
whereas 
in 
this 
case 
body 
B 
ought 
to 
turn 
back 
a 
little 
less, 
and 
body 
C 
a 
little 
more 
than 
in 
the 
case 
of 
equality, 
from 
which 
this 
casecanhardlybe 
distinguished. 


There 
are 
many 
other 
like 
incongruities 
resulting 
from 
the 
Cartesian 
rules, 
which 
the 
attention 
of 
a 
reader 
applying 
our 
principle 
will 
easily 
remark, 
and 
the 
like 
case 
which 
I 
had 
found 
in 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
Search 
after 
Truth 
came 
from 
the 
same 
source. 
Malebranche 
in 
a 
way 
avows 
that 
there 
are 
inconsistencies, 
but 
he 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
movement 
depending 
on 
the 
good 
pleasure 
of 
God, 
are 
regulated 
by 
his 
wisdom, 
and 
the 
geometricians 
would 
be 
also 
almost 
as 
much 
surprised 
to 
see 
these 
kinds 
of 
irregularities 
coming 
into 
nature 
as 
to 
see 
a 
parabola 
to 
which 
might 
be 
applied 
the 
properties 
of 
an 
illipse 
with 
an 
infinitely 
distant 
focus. 
Also 
such 
inconsistencies 
will 
never 
be 
encountered 
in 
nature, 
I 
think. 
The 
better 
it 
is 
knownthemoreitisfoundtobegeometrical. 
It 
iseasy 
tojudgefromthis 
that 
these 
inconsistencies 
do 
not 
properly 
come 
from 
that 
which 
Malebranche 
asserts 
they 
do, 
to 
wit: 
from 
the 
false 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
perfect 
hardness 
of 
bodies,whichIadmitis

Forevenifweshouldsupposein 



it 
this 
hardness, 
regarding 
it 
as 
infinitely 
quick 
elasticity, 
there 
would 
result 
from 
it 
nothing 
which 
could 
not 
be 
adjusted 
perfectly 
to 
the 
true 
laws 
of 
nature 
as 
regards 
elastic 
bodies 
in 
general, 
and 
never 
shall 
we 
encounter 
rules 
so 
little 
connected 
as 
these 
in 
which 
I 
have 
found 
something 
to 
censure. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
in 
composite 
things 
sometimes 
a 
little 
change 
may 
produce 
a 
great 
effect; 
as 
for 
example, 
a 
spark 
falling 
into 
a 
great 
mass 
of 
gunpowder 
is 
capable 
of 
overturning 
a 
whole 
city; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
contrary 
to 
our 
principle, 
and 
these 
cases 
may 
be 
accounted 
for 
by 
even 
general 
principles, 
but 
as 
respects 
elements 
or 
simple 
things, 
nothing 
similar 
could 
happen, 
otherwise 
naturewouldnotbetheeffect 
ofinfinitewisdom. 


Whence 
it 
is 
seen 
(a 
little 
better 
than 
in 
what 
is 
commonly 
said 
of 
it), 
how 
true 
physics 
must 
be 
derived 
really 
from 
the 
source 
of 
the 
divine 
perfections. 
It 
is 
God 
who 
is 
the 
final 
reason 
of 
things 
and 
the 
knowledge 
of 
God 
is 
no 
less 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
sciences 
than 
his 
essence 
and 
his 
will 
are 
the 
principles 
of 
beings. 
The 
most 
reasonable 
philosophers 
agree 
in 
tin’s, 
but 
there 
are 
very 
few 
of 
them 
who 
can 
make 
use 
of 
it 
to 
discover 
truths 
of 
importance. 


Perhaps 
these 
little 
attempts 
will 
arouse 
some 
to 
go 
much 
farther. 
It 
is 
sanctifying 
philosophy 
to 
make 
its 
streams 
flow 
from 
the 
fountain 
of 
the 
attributes 
of 
God. 
Far 
from 
excluding 
final 
causes 
and 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
being 
acting 
with 
wisdom, 
it 
is 
from 
thence 
that 
all 
must 
be 
derived 
in 
physics. 
This 
it 
is 
which 
Socrates 
in 
the 
Phaedo 
of 
Plato 
has 
already 
admirably 
remarked, 
when 
reasoning 
against 
Anaxagoras 
and 
other 
material 
philosophers 
who, 
after 
having 
at 
first 
recognized 
an 
intelligent 
principle 
above 
matter, 
do 
not 
employ 
it 
at 
all 
when 
they 
come 
to 
philosophize 
on 
the 
universe, 
and 
instead 
of 
showing 
that 
this 
intelligence 
does 
everything 
for 
the 
best, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
things 
which 
it 
has 
found 
good 
to 
produce 
conformably 
to 
its 
ends, 
try 
to 
explain 
everything 
by 
the 
mere 



concourse 
of 
senseless 
particles, 
confounding 
the 
conditions 
and 
instruments 
with 
the 
true 
cause. 
It 
is 
(said 
Socrates), 
as 
if 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
why 
I 
am 
seated 
in 
prison 
awaiting 
the 
fatal 
stroke 
and 
am 
not 
on 
the 
way 
to 
the 
Boeotians 
or 
other 
peoples, 
whither, 
it 
is 
known, 
I 
might 
have 
escaped, 
it 
should 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
because 
I 
have 
bones, 
tendons 
and 
muscles 
which 
can 
be 
bent 
as 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
be 
seated. 
My 
faith 
(he 
says), 
these 
bones 
and 
these 
muscles 
would 
not 
be 
here, 
and 
you 
would 
not 
see 
me 
in 
this 
posture 
if 
my 
mind 
had 
not 
judged 
that 
it 
is 
more 
worthy 
of 
Socrates 
to 
suffer 
what 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
country 
ordain. 
This 
passage 
in 
Plato 
deserves 
to 
be 
read 
entire, 
for 
these 
are 
very 
beautiful 
and 
solid 
reflections. 
Nevertheless 
I 
admit 
that 
particular 
effects 
of 
nature 
may 
and 
must 
be 
explained 
mechanically, 
without 
forgetting, 
however, 
their 
admirable 
designs 
and 
uses 
which 
Providence 
has 
known 
how 
to 
take 
care 
of, 
but 
the 
general 
principles 
of 
physics 
and 
even 
of 
mechanics 
themselves 
depend 
on 
the 
direction 
of 
a 
sovereign 
intelligence, 
and 
cannot 
be 
explained 
without 
taking 
it 
into 
consideration. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
piety 
must 
be 
reconciled 
with 
reason, 
and 
that 
good 
people 
may 
be 
satisfied 
who 
fear 
the 
results 
of 
the 
mechanical 
or 
corpuscular 
philosophy, 
as 
if 
it 
would 
lead 
us 
from 
God 
and 
immaterial 
substances, 
whereas 
with 
the 
required 
corrections 
and 
everything 
well 
understood,itoughttoleadus

PERSONALVIEWSON 
METAPHYSICS 
AND 


PHYSICS. 
1690. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



SIR 
— 
I 
am 
HOW 
on 
the 
point 
of 
returning 
home 
after 
a 
long 
journey, 
undertaken 
at 
the 
order 
of 
my 
prince 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
historical 
researches, 
in 
which 
I 
found 
certificates, 
titles 
and 
indubitable 
proofs 
sufficient 
to 
justify 
the 
common 
origin 
of 
the 
illustrious 
houses 
of 
Brunswick 
and 
Este, 
which 
Messrs. 
Justel, 
du 
Cange 
and 
others 
had 
good 
reasons 
for 
calling 
in 
question, 
because 
there 
were 
contradictions 
and 
falsities 
in 
the 
historians 
of 
Este 
in 
this 
respect, 
together 
with 
an 
utter 
confusion 
of 
times 
and 
persons. 
At 
present 
I 
think 
of 
returning 
and 
resuming 
my 
former 
course 
of 
life, 
and 
having 
written 
to 
you 
two 
years 
ago 
shortly 
before 
ml 
departure, 
I 
take 
the 
same 
liberty 
today, 
to 
inform 
myself 
of 
your 
health, 
and 
to 
make 
known 
to 
you 
how 
the 
idea 
of 
your 
eminent 
merit 
is 
always 
present 
in 
my 
mind. 
When 
I 
was 
at 
Rome 
I 
saw 
the 
denunciation 
of 
a 
new 
heresy 
attributed 
to 
you, 
or 
to 
your 
friends, 
and 
afterwards 
I 
saw 
the 
letter 
of 
reverend 
Father 
Mabillon 
to 
one 
of 
ml 
friends, 
in 
which 
there 
was 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
defense 
by 
the 
reverend 
Father 
Le 
Tellier 
of 
the 
missionaries 
against 
the 
practical 
morals 
of 
the 
Jesuits, 
had 
given 
to 
many 
people 
impressions 
favorable 
to 
these 
Fathers, 
but 
that 
he 
had 
heard 
that 
you 
had 
replied 
to 
it 
and 
that 
it 
was 
said 
that 
you 
had 
overthrown 
by 
geometrical 
reasoning 
the 
arguments 
of 
that 
Father. 
All 
of 
which 
leads 
me 
to 
think 
that 
you 
are 
still 
in 
condition 
to 
lender 
service 
to 
the 
public,and 
I 
pray 
God 
that 
it 
may 
be 
so 
fora 
long 
time 
to 
come. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
this 
is 
to 
my 
interest, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
praiseworthy 
interest 
which 
may 
give 
me 
the 



means 
of 
learning, 
whether 
it 
be 
in 
common 
with 
all 
others 
who 
shall 
read 
your 
works, 
or 
personally, 
when 
your 
judgments 
shall 
instruct 
me 
— 
if 
the 
little 
leisure 
you 
have 
may 
permit 
me 
again 
to 
hope 
sometimes 
for 
that 
advantage. 


As 
this 
voyage 
has 
in 
part 
served 
to 
relieve 
my 
mind 
from 
its 
ordinary 
occupations, 
I 
have 
had 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
conversing 
on 
matters 
of 
science 
and 
erudition 
with 
several 
able 
men, 
and 
I 
have 
communicated 
my 
personal 
views, 
which 
you 
know, 
to 
some 
in 
order 
to 
profit 
by 
their 
doubts 
and 
difficulties; 
and 
there 
have 
been 
some 
who, 
not 
satisfied 
with 
the 
common 
doctrines, 
have 
found 
an 
extraordinary 
satisfaction 
in 
some 
of 
my 
views. 
This 
has 
led 
me 
to 
write 
them 
down 
that 
they 
may 
he 
the 
more 
easily 
communicated, 
and 
perhaps 
I 
shall 
cause 
some 
copies 
to 
be 
printed 
some 
day 
without 
my 
name, 
merely 
to 
send 
them 
to 
my 
friends 
in 
order 
that 
I 
may 
have 
their 
judgment 
on 
them. 
I 
would 
like 
you 
to 
be 
able 
to 
examine 
them 
first, 
and 
for 
thatreason 
Ihave 
made 
thefollowing 
abstract: 


Body 
is 
an 
aggregate 
of 
substances, 
and 
not 
properly 
speaking 
one 
substance. 
It 
must 
he, 
consequently, 
that 
everywhere 
in 
body 
there 
are 
found 
indivisible 
substances, 
ingenerable 
and 
incorruptible, 
having 
something 
corresponding 
to 
souls. 
That 
all 
these 
substances 
have 
always 
been 
and 
always 
will 
be 
united 
to 
organic 
bodies 
differently 
transformable. 
That 
each 
of 
these 
substances 
contains 
in 
its 
nature 
legem 
continuationis 
seriei 
suarum 
operationmnandall 
that 
has 
happened 
or 
willhappen 
to 
it. 
That 
allits 
actions 
come 
from 
its 
own 
depths, 
except 
dependence 
on 
God. 
That 
each 
substance 
expressestheentire 
universe, 
butonemoredistinctlythan 
another,especially 
each 
as 
regards 
certain 
things 
and 
according 
to 
its 
own 
point 
of 
view. 
That 
the 
union 
of 
soul 
with 
body, 
and 
the 
operation 
also 
of 
one 
substance 
or 
another 
consists 
merely 
in 
that 
perfect 
mutual 
accord, 
expressly 
established 
by 
order 
of 
the 
first 
creation, 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
each 
substance 
following 
its 



own 
laws 
agrees 
in 
what 
the 
others 
demand; 
and 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
one 
follow 
or 
accompany 
thus 
the 
operation 
or 
change 
of 
the 
other. 
That 
intelligences 
or 
souls 
capable 
of 
reflection 
and 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
eternal 
truths 
and 
of 
God, 
have 
many 
privileges 
which 
exempt 
them 
from 
the 
vicissitudes 
of 
bodies. 
That 
for 
them 
moral 
laws 
must 
be 
added 
to 
physical. 
That 
all 
things 
are 
made 
principally 
for 
them. 
That 
they 
form 
together 
the 
republic 
of 
the 
universe, 
of 
which 
God 
is 
the 
monarch. 
That 
there 
is 
a 
perfect 
justice 
and 
police 
observed 
in 
this 
city 
of 
God, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
no 
wrong 
action 
without 
chastisement, 
nor 
good 
action 
without 
proportioned 
recompense. 
That 
the 
more 
we 
come 
to 
know 
things, 
the 
more 
we 
will 
find 
them 
beautiful 
and 
conformed 
to 
that 
which 
a 
sage 
would 
desire. 
That 
we 
should 
always 
be 
content 
with 
the 
order 
of 
the 
past, 
because 
it 
is 
conformed 
to 
the 
absolute 
will 
of 
God 
which 
is 
known 
by 
the 
event; 
but 
that 
we 
must 
try 
torenderthe 
futureas 
far 
asitdependson 
us,conformabletothepresumptive 
will 
of 
God 
or 
to 
his 
commandments; 
to 
beautify 
our 
Sparta 
and 
to 
labor 
to 
do 
good, 
without 
being 
depressed, 
however, 
when 
success 
fails, 
and 
this 
in 
the 
firm 
belief 
that 
God 
can 
discover 
the 
times 
most 
suited 
for 
changes 
for 
the 
better. 
That 
those 
who 
are 
not 
satisfied 
with 
the 
order 
of 
things 
cannot 
boast 
of 
loving 
God 
as 
he 
should 
be 
loved. 
That 
justice 
is 
but 
the 
love 
of 
the 
sage. 
That 
love 
is 
a 
universal 
benevolence 
which 
the 
sage 
fulfils 
conformably 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
reason, 
to 
the 
end 
of 
obtaining 
lasting 
contentment, 
which 
consists 
in 
a 
continual 
advance 
to 
greater 
perfection, 
or 
at 
least 
in 
the 
variationof 
alikedegreeof 
perfection. 


As 
regards 
physics, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
understand 
the 
nature 
of 
force, 
a 
thing 
entirely 
different 
from 
motion, 
which 
is 
something 
more 
relative. 
That 
this 
force 
is 
to 
be 
measured 
by 
the 
quantity 
of 
effect. 
That 
there 
is 
an 
absolute 
force, 
a 
directive 
force 
and 
a 
respective 
force. 
That 
each 
of 
these 
forces 
continues 
in 
the 
same 
degree 
in 
the 
universe, 
or 
in 
each 
machine 
not 
in 



communication 
with 
others, 
and 
that 
the 
two 
latter 
forces, 
taken 
together, 
compose 
the 
first 
or 
absolute. 
But 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
movement 
Is 
not 
preserved, 
since 
I 
show 
that 
otherwise 
the 
perpetual 
movement 
would 
be 
all 
found,andthattheeffectwouldbe 
more 
powerfulthanits 
cause. 


It 
is 
now 
some 
time 
ago 
that 
I 
published 
in 
the 
Leipsic 
Ada 
an 
essay 
on 
physics, 
to 
find 
the 
physical 
cause 
of 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
stars. 
I 
lay 
down 
as 
basis 
that 
all 
movement 
of 
a 
solid 
in 
a 
liquid, 
taking 
place 
in 
a 
curved 
line 
or 
the 
velocity 
of 
which 
is 
continually 
changing, 
comes 
from 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
liquid 
itself; 
whence 
I 
draw 
the 
inference 
that 
the 
stars 
have 
conforming 
but 
fluid 
orbits. 
I 
have 
demonstrated 
an 
important 
general 
proposition, 
viz: 
that 
every 
body 
that 
moves 
with 
a 
circulation 
which 
is 
harmonious 
(i. 
e. 
such 
that 
the 
distances 
from 
the 
center 
being 
in 
arithmetical 
progression 
the 
velocities 
are 
in 
harmonious 
progression, 
or 
reciprocal 
to 
the 
distances), 
and 
which 
furthermore 
has 
a 
paracentric 
movement, 
that 
is, 
of 
gravity 
or 
of 
levity 
as 
regards 
the 
same 
center 
(a 
certain 
law 
which 
this 
attraction 
or 
repulsion 
keeps), 
the 
said 
body 
has 
the 
areas 
necessarily 
as 
the 
times, 
just 
as 
Kepler 
observed 
among 
the 
planets. 
Then 
considering 
ex 
observationibus, 
that 
this 
movement 
is 
elliptic, 
I 
find 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
paracentric 
motion, 
which 
motion 
joined 
to 
harmonious 
circulation 
describes 
ellipses, 
must 
be 
such 
that 
the 
gravitations 
are 
reciprocally 
as 
the 
squares 
of 
thedistances;i. 
e. 
astheilluminations 
ex 
sole. 


I 
shall 
say 
nothing 
to 
you 
of 
my 
calculus 
of 
increments 
or 
differences, 
by 
which 
I 
determine 
the 
tangents, 
without 
eliminating 
the 
irrational 
quantities 
and 
fractions 
even 
when 
the 
unknown 
quantity 
is 
involved 
in 
them, 
and 
I 
subject 
quadratics 
and 
the 
transcendent 
problems 
to 
analysis. 
And 
I 
will 
not 
speak 
either 
of 
an 
entirely 
new 
analysis 
which 
belongs 
to 
geometry 
and 
is 
entirely 
different 
from 
algebra; 
and 
still 
less 
of 
some 
other 
things 
on 
which 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
had 
time 
to 
prepare 
essays. 
All 
of 
which 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
able 



to 
explain 
to 
you 
in 
few 
words, 
in

LETTER 
ON 
THEQUESTION, 
WHETHER 
THE 
ESSENCE 


OF 
BODY 
CONSISTS 
IN 
EXTENSION. 
1691. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



YOU 
ASK, 
SIR, 
the 
reasons 
which 
I 
have 
for 
believing 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
body 
or 
of 
matter 
is 
other 
than 
that 
of 
extension. 
It 
is 
true, 
as 
you 
say, 
that 
many 
able 
men 
are 
to-day 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
essence 
of 
body 
consists 
in 
length, 
breadth 
and 
depth. 
Nevertheless 
there 
are 
still 
others 
who 
cannot 
be 
accused 
of 
too 
much 
attachment 
to 
scholasticism, 
who 
are 
not 
content 
with 
this 
opinion. 


M. 
Nicole, 
in 
a 
certain 
place 
in 
his 
Essais, 
states 
that 
he 
is 
of 
this 
number 
and 
it 
seems 
to 
him 
that 
there 
is 
more 
of 
bias 
than 
of 
insight 
in 
those 
who 
do 
notappearrepelledbythedifficultieswhichare 
thereinencountered. 
It 
would 
require 
a 
very 
full 
discourse 
to 
explain 
clearly 
what 
I 
think 
on 
the 
subject. 
However, 
here 
are 
some 
considerations 
which 
I 
submit 
to 
your 
judgment,andIbegyou 
tomakeitknowntome. 


If 
the 
essence 
of 
body 
consisted 
in 
extension, 
this 
extension 
alone 
ought 
to 
be 
sufficient 
to 
account 
for 
all 
the 
properties 
of 
body. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
so. 
We 
notice 
in 
matter 
a 
quality, 
called 
by 
some 
natural 
inertia, 
by 
which 
body 
resists 
movement 
in 
a 
certain 
way; 
so 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
employ 
some 
force 
to 
set 
it 
in 
motion 
(even 
making 
abstraction 
of 
the 
weight), 
and 
a 
large 
bodyismovedwith 
moredifficulty 
thana 
small 
body. 
Forexample: 



if 
body 
A, 
in 
motion, 
encounters 
body 
B, 
at 
rest, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
if 
body 
B 
were 
indifferent 
to 
motion 
or 
to 
rest, 
it 
would 
allow 
itself 
to 
be 
pushed 
by 
body 
A 
without 
resisting 
it, 
and 
without 
decreasing 
the 
velocity 
or 
changing 
the 
direction 
of 
body 
A; 
and 
after 
their 
meeting 
A 
would 
continue 
its 
path 
and 
B 
would 
go 
in 
company 
with 
it, 
preceding 
it. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
thus 
in 
nature. 
The 
larger 
body 
B 
is, 
the 
more 
it 
will 
decrease 
the 
velocity 
with 
which 
body 
A 
moves, 
even 
to 
compelling 
it 
to 
retrograde 
if 
B 
is 
much 
larger 
than 
A. 
Now 
if 
there 
were 
nothing 
in 
bodies 
but 
extension, 
or 
situation, 
that 
is, 
that 
which 
geometricians 
recognize 
in 
them, 
joined 
to 
the 
one 
notion 
of 
change; 
this 
extension 
would 
be 
entirely 
indifferent 
respecting 
this 
change, 
and 
the 
results 
of 
the 
meeting 
of 
bodies 
would 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
mere 
geometrical 
composition 
of 
movements; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
body 
after 
the 
meeting 
would 
advance 
with 
a 
movement 
composed 
of 
the 
impression 
which 
it 
had 
before 
the 
shock 
and 
of 
that 
which 
it 
received 
from 
the 
concurrent, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
hinder 
it; 
that 
is, 
in 
this 
case 
of 
meeting 
it 
would 
go 
with 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
two 
velocities 
andfromthesideofthedirection. 



As 
the 
velocity 
of 
2 
A 
3 
A, 
or 
2 
B 
3 
B, 
in 
figure 
II, 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
1A 
2 
A 
and 
1B 
2B; 
and 
in 
the 
case 
of 
contact, 
figure 
III, 
when 
the 
quickest 
should 
touch 
a 
slower 
one 
which 
precedes 
it, 
the 
slower 
would 
receive 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
other, 
and 
in 
general 
they 
would 
proceed 
always 
together 
after 
the 
meeting; 
and 
in 
particular, 
as 
I 
said 
at 
the 
beginning, 
that 
one 
which 
is 
in 
motion 
would 
carry 
forward 
the 
one 
in 
repose, 
without 
receiving 
any 
diminution 
of 
its 
speed, 
and 
without 
the 
size, 
equality 
or 
inequality 
of 
the 
two 
bodies 
changing 
in 
any 
respect; 
a 
thing 
utterly 
irreconcilable 
with 
experience. 
And 
even 
if 
we 
should 
suppose 
that 
size 
ought 
to 
make 
a 
change 
in 
the 
movement 
we 
should 
have 
no 
principle 
for 
determining 
the 
means 
of 
estimating 
it 
in 
detail, 
and 
for 
knowing 
the 
resulting 
direction 
and 
velocity. 
In 
any 
case 
we 
should 
incline 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
motion; 
whereas 
I 
believe 
that 
I 
have 
proved 
that 
the 
same 
force 
is 
preserved, 
and 
that 
its 
quantity 
is 
different 
from 
the 
quantity 
of 
themotion. 


All 
this 
shows 
that 
there 
is 
in 
matter 
something 
other 
than 
what 
is 
purely 
geometrical; 
that 
is, 
than 
-extension 
and 
its 
change 
pure 
and 
simple. 
And 
when 
we 
consider 
it 
well 
we 
perceive 
that 
there 
must 
he 
joined 
to 
it 
some 



higher 
or 
metaphysical 
notion, 
to 
wit: 
that 
of 
substance, 
action 
and 
force 
and 
that 
these 
notions 
show 
that 
everything 
which 
suffers 
must 
act 
reciprocally, 
and 
that 
everything 
which 
acts 
must 
suffer 
some 
reaction; 
and 
consequently 
that 
a 
body 
at 
rest 
cannot 
he 
carried 
along 
by 
another 
in 
motion 
without 
changingsomethingof 
thedirection 
andofthe 
velocityofthe 
agent. 


Iagree 
thatnaturallyeverybodyisextended, 
andthatthereisno 
extension 
without 
body. 
Nevertheless 
the 
notions 
of 
place, 
of 
space, 
of 
pure 
extension, 
must 
not 
be 
confounded 
with 
the 
notionof 
substance 
which 
besides 
extension 
includes 
resistance, 
thatisactionandpassion. 


This 
consideration 
seems 
to 
me 
important, 
not 
only 
in 
order 
to 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
extended 
substance, 
but 
also 
in 
order 
not 
to 
slight 
in 
physics 
the 
higher 
and 
immaterial 
principles, 
to 
the 
prejudice 
of 
piety. 
For 
although 
I 
am 
persuaded 
that 
everything 
takes 
place 
mechanically 
in 
corporeal 
nature 
I 
do 
not 
cease 
to 
believe 
also 
that 
even 
the 
principles 
of 
mechanics, 
that 
is, 
the 
first 
laws 
of 
motion, 
have 
a 
more 
exalted 
origin 
than 
that 
which 
pure 
mathematics 
can 
furnish. 
And 
I 
imagine 
that 
if 
this 
were 
better 
known 
or 
more 
considered 
many 
pious 
persons 
would 
not 
have 
such 
a 
bad 
opinion 
of 
the 
corpuscular 
philosophy, 
and 
modern 
philosophers 
would 
better 
join 
the 
knowledge 
ofnaturewith 
thatof 
itsauthor. 


I 
do 
not 
enlarge 
upon 
other 
reasons 
touching 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
for 
that 
would 
leadmetoofar. 


[ExtractfromaLetterinSupportofwhathe 
published 
inthe 
“Journal 
des 
Savans” 
ofJune18,1691. 
1693.] 


To 
prove 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
body 
does 
not 
consist 
in, 
extension 
I 
made 
use 
of 
an 
argument 
explained 
in 
the 
Journal 
des 
Savans 
of 
June 
18, 
1691, 
the 
gist 
of 
which 
is 
that 
we 
cannot 
explain 
by 
mere 
extension 
the 
natural 
inertia 
of 
bodies; 
that 
is, 
that 
which 
causes 
matter 
to 
resist 
movement,orinother 
words 



that 
which 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
a 
body 
which 
is 
already 
in 
motion 
cannot 
carry 
along 
with 
it 
another 
which 
is 
at 
rest, 
without 
being 
retarded 
thereby. 
For 
extension 
in 
itself, 
being 
indifferent 
to 
movement 
and 
to 
rest, 
nothing 
ought 
to 
hinder 
the 
two 
bodies 
from 
going 
alongtogether 
withall 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
first, 
which 
it 
tries 
to 
impress 
upon 
the 
second. 
To 
this, 
answer 
is 
made 
in 
the 
Journal 
ofJuly16thof 
the 
same 
year(asI 
learned 
onlyashorttimeago), 
that 
really 
body 
ought 
to 
be 
indifferent 
to 
movement 
or 
to 
rest, 
supposing 
that 
its 
essence 
consists 
only 
in 
being 
extended; 
but 
that 
nevertheless 
a 
body 
impelling 
another 
must 
be 
retarded 
by 
it 
(not 
because 
of 
extension 
but 
because 
of 
force), 
because 
the 
same 
force 
which 
was 
applied 
to 
one 
of 
the 
bodies 
is 
now 
applied 
to 
both. 
Now 
the 
force 
which 
moves 
one 
of 
the 
bodies 
with 
a 
certain 
velocity 
must 
move 
the 
two 
together 
with 
less 
velocity. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
it 
were 
said 
in 
other 
words 
that 
body, 
if 
it 
consist 
in 
extension, 
ought 
to 
be 
indifferent 
to 
motion, 
but 
that 
in 
reality 
not 
being 
indifferent 
to 
it, 
since 
it 
resists 
that 
which 
ought 
to 
give 
it 
motion, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
employ, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
extension, 
that 
of 
force. 
Thus 
this 
reply 
grants 
just 
what 
I 
wish. 
And 
in 
truth 
those 
who 
are 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
system 
of 
Occasional 
Causes 
have 
already 
clearly 
perceived 
that 
force 
and 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
which 
depend 
on 
it, 
cannot 
be 
drawn 
from 
extension 
alone, 
and 
as 
they 
have 
taken 
for 
granted 
that 
there 
is 
only 
extension 
in 
matter, 
they 
have 
been 
obliged 
to 
deny 
to 
it 
force 
and 
action 
and 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
the 
general 
cause, 
which 
is 
the 
pure 
will 
and 
action 
of 
God. 
As 
to 
which 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
theyhaveverywellreasoned 
ex 
hypothesi. 
But 
the 
hypothesis 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
proved; 
and 
as 
the 
conclusion 
appears 
not 
to 
accord 
in 
physics, 
there 
is 
more 
probability 
for 
saying 
that 
there 
is 
a 
mistake 
in 
the 
hypothesis 
(which 
moreover 
involves 
manyother 
difficulties), 
and 
thatthere 
must 
be 
recognized 
in 
matter 
something 
more 
than 
what 
consists 
in 
the 
mere 
relation 
of 
extension; 
which, 
like 
space, 
is 
incapable 
of 
action 
and 
of 
resistance, 
these 



pertaining 
only 
to 
substances. 
Those 
who 
hold 
that 
extension 
itself 
is 
a 
substance 
reverse 
the 
order 
of 
words 
as 
well 
as 
of 
thoughts. 
Besides 
extension, 
there 
must 
be 
a 
subject 
which 
is 
extended, 
that 
is, 
a 
substance 
to 
which 
it 
belongs 
to 
be 
repeated 
or 
continued. 
For 
extension 
signifies 
only 
a 
repetition 
or 
continued 
multiplication 
of 
that 
which 
is 
extended; 
a 
plurality, 
continuity 
and 
co-existence 
of 
parts; 
and 
hence 
extension 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
explain 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
extended 
or 
repeated 
substance, 
the 
notion 
of 
which 
is 
anteriorto 
thatof 
itsrepetition. 



ANIMADVERSIONS 
ON 
DESCARTES’ 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
PHILOSOPHY. 
1692. 


[From 
the 
Latin.] 



ON 
ARTICLE 
1. 
As 
to 
what 
is 
said 
by 
Descartes, 
that 
we 
must 
doubt 
all 
things 
in 
which 
there 
is 
the 
least 
uncertainty, 
it 
would 
be 
preferable 
to 
express 
it 
by 
this 
better 
and 
more 
expressive 
precept: 
We 
ought 
to 
think 
what 
degree 
of 
acceptance 
or 
dissent 
everything 
merits; 
or 
more 
simply, 
We 
ought 
to 
inquire 
after 
the 
reasons 
of 
any 
dogma. 
Thus 
the 
Cartesian 
wranglings 
concerning 
doubt 
would 
cease. 
But 
perhaps 
the 
author 
preferred 
παραδοξολογειν, 
in 
order 
that 
he 
might 
excite 
the 
listless 
reader 
by 
novelty. 
But 
I 
could 
wish 
that 
he 
himself 
had 
remembered 
his 
own 
precept, 
or 
rather, 
that 
he 
had 
conceived 
its 
true 
force. 
We 
shall 
explain 
it 
and 
its 
use 
best 
by 
the 
example 
of 
the 
geometers. 
It 
is 
agreed 
among 
them 
that 
there 
are 
axioms 
or 
postulates, 
on 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
all 
other 
things 
rests. 
We 
admit 
these, 
both 
because 
they 
immediately 
satisfy 
the 
mind 
and 
because 
they 
are 
verified 
by 
numberless 
examples; 
and 
nevertheless 
it 
would 
be 
of 
importance 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
science 
that 
they 
be 
demonstrated. 
This, 
Apollonius 
and 
Proclus 
in 
olden 
time 
and 
recently 
Robervallius, 
among 
others, 
have 
attempted. 
And 
certainly 
just 
as 
Euclid 
wished 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
two 
sides 
of 
a 
triangle 
taken 
together 
are 
greater 
than 
the 
third 
(as 
a 
certain 
one 
of 
the 
ancients 
jestingly 
said, 
even 
asses 
know 
enough 
to 
go 
after 
their 
food 
by 
a 
straight 
line, 
not 
by 
a 
roundabout 
way), 
because 
indeed 
he 
wished 
that 
geometrical 
truths 
should 
rest 
not 
on 
images 
of 
the 
senses 
but 
on 
reasons; 
so 
also 
he 
could 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
two 
right 
lines 
(which 
if 
extended 
do 
not 
meet) 
can 
have 
only 
one 
common 
point, 
if 
he 
had 
had 
a 
good 
definition 
of 
right. 
And 
I 



know 
that 
the 
demonstrating 
of 
axioms 
is 
of 
great 
use 
to 
a 
true 
analysis 
or 
art 
of 
discovery. 
Thus 
if 
Descartes 
had 
wished 
to 
follow 
what 
is 
best 
in 
his 
precept, 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
labored 
toward 
demonstrating 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
sciences, 
and 
to 
have 
done 
in 
philosophy 
what 
Proclus 
wished 
to 
do 
in 
geometry 
where 
it 
is 
less 
necessary. 
But 
it 
seemed 
preferable 
to 
our 
author 
to 
have 
applause, 
rather 
than 
to 
havecertainty. 
NorwouldI 
blame 
him 
forbeing 
content 
with 
probability, 
if 
he 
had 
not 
aroused 
our 
minds 
by 
such 
a 
great 
profession 
of 
strictness: 
but 
I 
blame 
Euclid 
much 
less 
when 
he 
makes 
assumptions 
without 
proof, 
for 
he 
maintained 
that 
we 
know 
that 
if 
a 
few 
hypotheses 
are 
admitted, 
all 
else 
is 
sure 
and 
thus 
equal 
to 
them 
in 
trustworthiness. 
If 
Descartes 
or 
other 
philosophers 
had

the

also, 
who 
condemn 
the

on 
the 
pretext 
that 
they 
use

not 
immediately 
demonstrated, 
ought 
to 
regard 
this 
as

them. 
I, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
hold 
that 
the

ought 
rather 
to 
be 
praised 
because 
they 
prop 
up 
the 
sciences 
by 
these, 
as 
it 
were, 
pegs, 
and 
devise 
an 
art 
of 
proceeding 
and 
of 
deducing 
many 
things 
from 
few; 
for 
if 
they 
had 
wished 
to 
defer 
the 
invention 
of

or 
problems 
until 
all 
axioms

I

am 
is 
well 
remarked 
by 
Descartes 
to 
be 
among 
first 
truths. 
But 
it 
was 
but 
just 
that 
he 
should 
not 
neglect 
others 
equal 
to 
this. 
In 
general, 
therefore, 
it 
may 
be 
said: 
Truths 
are 
either 
of 
fact 
or 
of 
reason. 
The 
first 
ofthe 
truths 
of 
reason 
is, 
as 
Aristotle 
rightlyobserved, 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction 
or, 
what 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
of 
identity. 
First 
truths 
of 
fact 
are 
as 
many 
as 
the 
immediate 
perceptions, 
or 
those 
of 
consciousness, 
so 
to 
speak. 
Moreover 
not 
only 
am 
I 
conscious 
of 
my 
thinking 
but 
also 
of 
my 
thoughts. 
Nor 
is 
it 
more 
certain 
that 
I 
think 
than 
that 
this 
or 
that 
is 
thought 
by 
me. 
Thus 
first 
truths 
of 
fact 
may 
be 
not 
inconveniently 
referred 
to 
these 
two, 
I 
think, 
and 
Various

I

a

certainly 
he 
adds 
nothing

What 
he 
brings 
forward 
in 
his 
Meditations 
will 
be 
examined 
in 
its 
proper 
place. 
He 
who 
thinks 
that 
the

is 
corporeal, 
will 
not 
admit 
that 
you 
can 
affirm 
that 
no 
corporeal 
things 
exist; 
but 
he 
will 
admit 
this, 
that 
you 
can 
doubt 
(as 
long 
as 
you 
are 
ignorant 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
mind) 
whether 
corporeal 
things 
exist 
or 
do 
not 
exist; 
and 
since, 
nevertheless, 
you 
see 
clearly 
that 
your 
mind 
does 
exist, 
he 
will 
concede 
that 
this 
one 
thing 
thence 
follows, 
namely 
that 
you 
can 
doubt 
whether 
the 
mind 
is 
corporeal; 
nor 
will 
anything 
further 
be 
wrested 
by 
any 
tortures 
fromthisargument. 
But 
this 
furnished 
a 
handle 
to

paralogism 
in

above, 
the 
liberty 
being 
assumed 
of 
rejecting 
what

as 
if 
it

to

that 
there

because 
it

the

from

and 
which 
occur 
also

arithmetical 
calculations 
(even 
after 
a 
perfect 
method 
has 
been 
found 
as 
in 
numbers) 
are 
recounted 
here 
to 
no 
purpose, 
since 
no 
art 
can 
be 
devised 
in 
which 
they 
are 
not 
to 
be 
feared, 
especially 
when 
the 
reasoning 
must 
be 
long 
drawn 
out; 
and 
that 
therefore 
we 
must 
have 
recourse 
to 
examinations. 
As 
for 
the 
rest, 
God 
seems 
to 
be 
summoned 
hither 
for 
a 
sort 
of 
show 
or 
pomp; 
not 
to 
mention 
thatthestrangefiction 
ordoubt,whetherweare 
notmadeto 
err 
even 
in 
matters 
most 
evident, 
ought 
to 
move 
no

the 
nature 
of 
evidence 
is 
against 
it 
and 
the 
experiences 
and 
successes 
of 
all 
life 
are 
contrary 
to 
it. 
And 
if 
ever 
this 
doubt 
could 
justly 
be 
raised, 
it 
would 
be 
absolutely 
insuperable; 
it 
would 
confront 
even 
Descartes 
himself 
and 
every 
one 
else 
even 
when 
presenting 
the 
most 
evident 
things; 
this 
I 
say, 
not 
to 
mention 
that 
it 
must 
be 
known 
that 
this 
doubt 
is 
not 
established 
by 
denying; 
God 
nor 
removed 
by 
introducing 
him. 
For 
even 
if 
there 
were 
no 
God, 
provided 
it 
were 
possible 
for 
us 
to 
continue 
to 
exist, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
reason 
for 
our 
being 
less 
capable 
of 
truth; 
and 
although 
it 
be 
conceded 
that 
there 
is 
a 
God, 
it 
does 
not 
therefore 
follow 
that 
a 
creature 
exceedingly 
fallible 
and 
imperfect 
does 
not 
exist, 
especially 
when 
it 
may 
be 
that 
its 
imperfection 
is 
not 
native, 
but 
perhaps 
superinduced 
by 
a 
great 
sin, 
as 
Christian 
theologians 
teach 
concerning 
original 
sin, 
yet 
so 
that 
this 
sin 
cannot 
be 
imputed 
to 
God. 
Moreover 
although 
God 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
here 
aptly 
introduced, 
I 
think, 
nevertheless, 
but 
in 
a 
different 
way, 
that 
true 
knowledge 
of 
God 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
higher 
wisdom; 
for 
God 
is 
not 
less 
the 
first 
cause 
than 
the 
ultimate 
reason 
of 
things;

The 
argument 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
drawn 
from 
the 
notion 
itself 
of 
him, 
Anselm, 
Archbishop 
of 
Canterbury, 
first, 
so 
far 
as 
is 
known, 
discovered 
and 
stated 
in 
his 
extant 
Liber 
contra 
Insipientem. 
And 
it 
was 
examined 
here 
and 
there 
by 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
scholastic 
theology 
and 
by 
Aquinas 
himself, 
whence 
Descartes, 
not 
without 
study 
of 
it, 
seems 
to 
have 
borrowed 
it. 
This 
reasoning 
possesses 
some 
beauty 
but 
is 
nevertheless 
imperfect. 
The 
argument 
amounts 
to 
this: 
Whatever 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
from 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
thing, 
that 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
thing. 
Now 
from 
the 
notion 
of 
most 
perfect 
or 
greatest 
being, 
existence 
can 
be 
demonstrated. 
Therefore 
existence 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
most 
perfect 
being 
(God), 
or 
God 
exists. 
The 
assumption 
is 
proved: 
Most 
perfect 
or 
greatest 
being 
includes 
all 
perfections, 
therefore 
existence 
also, 
which 
undoubtedly 
is 
of 
the 
number 
of 
perfections, 
since 
to 
exist 
is 
more 
or 
greater 
than 
not 
to 
exist. 
Thus 
far 
the 
argument. 
But 
if 
perfection 
or 
magnitude 
had 
been 
omitted, 
the 
argument 
might 
have 
been 
constructed 
even 
more 
strictly 
and 
more 
closely 
in 
this 
way. 
Necessary 
being 
exists 
(or 
being 
to 
whose 
essence 
existence 
belongs, 
or 
being 
of 
itself 
exists), 
as 
is 
evident 
from 
the 
terms. 
Now 
God 
is 
such 
a 
being 
(fromthe 
definition 
ofGod);thereforeGodexists. 
Thesearguments 
are 
valid, 
provided 
it 
be 
admitted 
that 
most 
perfect 
or 
necessary 
being 
is 
possible, 
and 
does 
not 
imply 
contradiction, 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
that 
the 
essence 
from 
which 
existence 
follows 
is 
possible. 
But 
as 
long 
as 
this 
has 
not 
been 
demonstrated, 
it 
certainly 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
thought 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
has 
been 
perfectly 
demonstrated 
by 
such 
an 
argument. 
And, 
generally, 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
known 
(as 
I 
formerly 
urged), 
that 
from 
a 
definition 
nothing 
can 
be 
safely 
inferred 
concerning 
the 
thing 
defined,solong 
as 
it 
is 
not 
established 
that 
the 
definition 
expresses 
something 
possible. 
For 
if 
perchance, 
it 
implies 
some 
hidden 
contradiction, 
it 
might 
happen 
that 
something 
absurd 
would 
be 
deduced 
from 
it. 
Meanwhile 
from 
this 
argument 
we 
become 
acquainted 
with 



this 
wonderful 
privilege 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
that 
provided 
it 
be 
possible 
it 
exists 
of 
itself, 
which 
is 
not 
sufficient 
for 
proving 
existence 
in 
other 
things. 
There 
only 
remains 
for 
the 
geometrical 
demonstration 
of 
the 
divine 
existence 
that 
till 
possibility 
of 
God 
be 
demonstrated 
with 
accurate 
severity 
in 
geometrical 
rigor. 
Meanwhile 
the 
existence 
of 
that 
which 
only 
lacks 
possibility 
receives 
great 
faith: 
as 
for 
the 
rest,

there

We 
have

and 
therefore 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
idea 
(that 
is, 
the 
most 
perfect 
being) 
exists. 
This 
which 
is 
Descartes’

something, 
understanding 
what 
we 
say, 
we 
have 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
thing. 
For 
it 
often 
happens 
that 
we 
combine 
incompatibles, 
as 
when 
we

which 
is 
admittedtobeimpossible 
andthereforelacksidea; 
andneverthelessweadmit 
that 
we

this 
with

Indeed 
it 
has 
been 
explained 
by 
me 
elsewhere 
that 
we 
often 
only 
confusedly 
think 
that 
of 
which 
we 
speak,

As 
to 
what 
pertains 
to 
the 
ends 
which 
God 
proposed 
to 
himself, 
I 
clearly 
think 
both

those 
ends 
of 
God 
are 
to 
be 
known 
and 
to 
be 
investigated 
with 
great 
profit 
and 
that 
contempt 
of 
this 
inquiry 
is 
not 
free 
from 
peril 
or 
suspicion. 
And, 
in 
general, 
as 
often 
as 
we 
see 
that 
something 
has 
remarkable 
uses, 
we 
may 
safely 
assert 
that 
among 
others 
this 
end 
also, 
namely, 
that 
he 
might 
furnish 
these 
uses, 
was 
proposed 
to 
God 
when 
producing 
this 
thing, 
since 
he 
both 
knew 
and 
procured 
this 
use 
of 
the 
thing.

That 
errors 
depend 
more 
upon 
the 
will 
than 
upon 
the 
intellect, 
I 
do 
not 
admit. 
To 
believe 
that 
true 
which 
is 
false 
or 
that 
false 
which 
is 
true 
when 
this 
may 
be 
known 
by 
investigating, 
this 
is 
to 
err. 
So 
also’ 
through 
consciousness 
or 
memory 
certain 
perceptions 
or 
reasons 
arise, 
and 



therefore 
do 
not 
depend 
on 
the 
will 
except 
in 
so 
far 
as 
in 
some 
indirect 
way, 
and 
sometimes 
even 
unknown 
to 
us, 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
we 
seem 
to 
ourselves 
to 
see 
those 
things 
which 
we 
will. 
Cf. 
Art. 
6. 
We 
judge 
therefore 
not 
because 
we 
will 
but 
because 
it 
appears 
And 
as 
for 
the 
saying 
that 
the 
will 
is 
wider 
than 
the 
intellect, 
this 
is 
more 
sounding 
than 
true; 
in 
a 
word, 
I 
may 
say 
it 
is 
but 
trappings 
for 
the 
people. 
We 
will 
nothing 
except 
it 
appear 
to 
the 
intellect. 
The 
origin 
of 
all 
errors 
is 
the 
same, 
that 
which 
is 
observed 
as 
the 
reason 
of 
errors 
of 
reckoning 
among 
arithmeticians. 
For 
it 
often 
happens 
from 
a 
defect 
of 
attention 
or 
memory 
that 
we 
do 
what 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
do, 
or 
leave 
undone 
what 
we 
ought 
to 
do, 
or 
think 
that 
we 
have 
done 
what 
we 
have 
not 
done 
or 
that 
we 
have 
not 
done 
what 
we 
have 
done. 
So 
it 
happens 
that 
in 
reckonings 
(to 
which 
reasoning 
corresponds 
in 
the 
mind) 
the 
right 
figures 
are 
not 
set 
down, 
wrong 
ones 
are 
put 
down, 
something 
is 
passed 
over 
among 
the 
things 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account, 
the 
method 
is 
disturbed. 
Our 
mind, 
indeed, 
wearied 
or 
distracted, 
does 
not, 
for 
its 
present 
operations, 
sufficiently 
attend 
to 
the 
matter; 
or, 
by 
an 
error 
of 
memory, 
it 
assumes 
as 
if 
formerly 
proved 
that 
which 
only 
adheres 
to 
us 
deeply 
because 
it 
has 
been 
often 
inculcated 
or 
fixedly 
regarded 
or 
eagerly 
desired. 
The 
remedy 
also 
for 
our 
errors 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
for 
the 
errors 
of 
reckoning, 
namely, 
that 
we 
attend 
to 
the 
matter 
and 
to 
the 
form, 
that 
we 
proceed 
slowly, 
that 
we 
repeat 
and 
vary 
the 
operation, 
that 
we 
institute 
examinations 
or 
proofs, 
that 
we 
divide 
longer 
reasonings 
into 
parts, 
by 
which 
the 
mind 
may 
breathe, 
and 
that 
we 
confirm 
each 
part, 
as 
may 
be, 
by 
particular 
proofs. 
And 
since 
we 
must 
in 
action 
sometimes 
be 
hurried, 
the 
great 
thing 
is 
to 
have 
acquired 
presence 
of 
mind 
for 
one’s 
self 
by 
force 
of 
habit, 
just 
as 
those 
have 
done 
who 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
tumult 
and 
even 
without 
writing 
or 
calculations 
are 
none 
the 
less 
able 
to 
compute 
large 
numbers, 
so 
that 
the 
mind 
is 
not 
easily 
distracted 
either 
by 
the 
external 
senses 
or 
by 
its 
own 
imaginations 
or 
emotions, 
but 
always 
rises 



above 
what 
it 
is 
doing 
and 
retains 
the 
lower 
of 
regarding, 
or, 
as 
we 
commonly 
say, 
of 
turning 
itself 
back 
upon 
itself, 
so 
that 
presently, 
in 
place 
of 
an 
external 
admonisher 
it 
may 
say, 
“See 
what 
you 
are 
doing, 
say 
why 
you 
are 
here, 
the 
hour 
passes.” 
The 
Germans 
admirably 
call 
this 
sich 
begreiffen; 
the 
Frenchnotlesshappily, 
s’aviser, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
to 
warn 
one’s 
self, 
to 
suggest 
to 
one’s 
self, 
as 
the 
nomenclators 
suggested 
to 
Roman 
candidates 
the 
names 
and 
merits 
of 
citizens 
worthy 
to 
be 
taken, 
as 
the 
prompter 
suggests 
to 
the 
comedian 
the 
initial 
words 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
piece, 
as 
a 
certain 
youth 
suggested 
to 
Philip, 
king 
of 
Macedon, 
“Remember 
you 
are 
mortal.” 
But 
this 
turning 
of 
the 
mind, 
s’aviser, 
is 
not 
in 
our 
power 
nor 
in 
the 
election 
of 
our 
will; 
on 
the 
contrary 
it 
must 
first 
occur 
to 
the 
intellect, 
and 
it 
depends 
on 
the 
present 
degree 
of 
our 
perfection. 
It 
belongs 
to 
the 
will 
in 
advance 
to 
strive 
zealously 
that 
the 
mind 
be 
well 
prepared 
which 
is 
advantageously 
done 
both 
by 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
experiences 
and 
losses 
or 
dangers 
of 
others, 
and 
also 
by 
the 
use 
of 
our 
own, 
but 
(as 
is 
allowable) 
this 
is 
at 
the 
risk 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
time 
or 
at 
least 
of 
a 
light 
or 
ludicrous 
injury; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
there 
is 
the 
accustoming 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
a 
certain 
order 
and 
method 
of 
thinking 
so 
that 
afterwards 
it 
may 
occur, 
when 
it 
is 
needed, 
as 
if 
voluntarily. 
There 
nevertheless 
are 
errors 
which 
without 
guilt 
escape 
or 
are 
not 
avoided. 
Where 
we 
are 
In 
trouble 
not 
by 
defect 
of 
judgment 
but 
by 
want 
of 
memory 
or 
ability 
we 
are 
not 
so 
much 
in 
error 
as 
we 
are 
ignorant, 
for 
we 
cannot 
bring 
it 
about 
that 
we 
may 
either 
know 
or 
remember 
what 
we 
will. 
That 
kind 
of 
directing 
the 
mind 
suffices 
by 
which 
we 
tight 
against 
lack 
of 
attention, 
and 
as 
often 
as 
memory 
repeats 
to 
us 
past 
proofs 
which 
perchance 
were 
in 
reality 
none, 
we 
have 
a 
confused 
recollection 
which 
is 
suspicions; 
and 
either 
we 
repeat 
the 
inquiry 
if 
it 
may

and

is 
important,

The

To 
ask 
whether 
there

liberty 
in

is 
the

as 
to 
ask 
whether 
choice 
is 
in 
our

Free 
and 
voluntary 
mean 
the 
same 
thing. 
For 
free 
is 
the 
same 
as 
spontaneous 
with 
reason; 
and 
to 
will 
is 
to 
be 
carried 
to 
action 
by

reason

If 
anyone 
thinking 
that 
God 
has 
preordained 
all 
things 
and 
nevertheless 
that 
he 
himself

free, 
and 
his 
arguments 
exhibiting 
conflict 
among 
themselves, 
makes 
this 
one 
reply, 
as 
Descartes 
orders; 
namely: 
that 
his

is 
finite

cannot 
comprehend 
such 
things, 
he

the 
conclusion, 
not 
to 
the

to 
cut, 
not 
to 
untie,

knot.

question 
is 
not 
whether 
you

rather 
whether 
you

your

must

a 
contradiction

the

of 
faith

less 
than 
in 
the 
mysteries 
of

Therefore 
if 
you 
wish 
to 
excel 
as 
a 
philosopher, 
it 
behooves 
that 
you 
take 
up 
the 
argument,

one 
of 
your

infers

I 
have 
elsewhere 
called 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
no 
great 
use 
in 
this 
rule 
which 
is 
laid 
down, 
of 
approving 
only 
what 
is 
clear 
and 
distinct, 
unless 
better 
marksof 
clear 
and 
distinctare 
brought 
forward 
than 
those 
which 
Descartes 
gave. 
The 
rules 
of 
Aristotle 
and 
the 



geometers 
are 
better, 
namely: 
That 
we 
should 
admit 
nothing, 
principles 
(i. 
e. 
first 
truths 
and 
hypotheses) 
of 
course 
excepted, 
unless 
proved 
by 
legitimate 
argument; 
legitimate, 
I 
say, 
that 
is, 
burdened 
neither 
with 
defect 
of 
form 
nor 
of 
matter. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
defect 
of 
matter 
if 
anything 
except 
principles 
or 
again 
things 
proved 
from 
principles 
by 
legitimate 
argument, 
be 
assumed. 
But 
I 
understand 
the 
right 
form 
to 
be 
not 
only 
the 
common 
syllogistic 
form, 
but 
also 
any 
other 
predemonstrated 
which 
concludes 
by 
force 
of 
its 
own 
disposition; 
which 
also 
the

kinds 
of 
substances 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
definitions. 
But 
that 
extension 
constitutes 
till 
common 
nature 
of 
corporeal 
substance 
I 
see 
asserted 
by 
many 
with 
great 
confidence, 
never 
proved. 
Certainly 
neither 
motion 
nor 
action 
nor 
resistance 
nor 
passion 
is 
thence 
derived; 
nor 
do 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
which 
are 
observed 
in 
the 
motion 
and 
conjunction 
of 
bodies 
come 
from 
the 
mere 
notion 
of 
extension, 
as 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
shown. 
And 
indeed 
the 
notion 
of 
extension 
is 
not 
primitive 
but 
resolvable. 
For 
it 
is 
required 
in 
extension 
that 
there 
be 
a 
whole 
continuum, 
in 
which 
many 
things 
exist 
at 
once. 
And, 
to 
speak 
farther, 
to 
extension 
indeed, 
the 
notion 
of 
which 
is 
relative, 
something 
is 
required 
which 
is 
extended 
or 
continued, 
as 
in 
milk 
whiteness, 
in 
body 
that 
itself 
which 
makes 
its 
essence: 
the 
repetition 
of 
this 
(whatever 
it 
may 
be) 
is 
extension. 
And 
I 
certainly 
agree 
with 
Huygens 
(whoseopinionin 
naturalphilosophy 
andmathematicsisofgreatweightwith 
me) 
that 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
vacant 
space 
and 
of 
mere 
extension 
is 
the 
same; 
nor 
in 
my 
opinion 
can 
mobility 
itself 
or 
αντιτυπια 
be 
understood 
of 
mere 
extension 
but 
of 
the 
subject 
of 
extension, 
by 
which 
place 
is 
not 
only 
constitutedbutalsotilled.

as 
something 
outside

It 
seems 
to 
me 
fair 
that 
we 
should 
give 
to 
the 
ancients 
each 
one 
his 
due, 
nor 
by 
a 
silence, 
malignant 
and 
injurious 
to 
ourselves, 
conceal 
their 
merits. 
Those 
things 
which 
Aristotle 
prescribed 
in 
his 
Logic, 
although 
not 
sufficient 
for 
discovery 
are 
nevertheless 
almost 
sufficient 
for 
judging; 
at 
least 
where 
he 
treats 
of 
necessary 
consequences; 
and 
it 
is 
important 
that 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
human 
mind 
be 
established 
as 
if 
by 
certain 
mathematical 
rules. 
And 
it 
has 
been 
noted 
by 
me 
that 
those 
who 
admit 
false 
reasonings 
in 
serious 
things 
oftener 
sin 
in 
logical 
form 
than 
is 
commonly 
believed. 
Thus 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
all 
errors 
there 
is 
need 
of 
nothing 
else 
than 
to 
use 
the 
most 
common 
rules 
of 
logic 
with 
great 
constancy 
and 
severity. 
But 
since 
the 
complication 
of 
things 
often 
does 
not 
admit 
of 
this 
pedantry, 
we 
hence 
furnish, 
in 
the 
sciences 
and 
in 
things 
to 
be 
done, 
certain 
special 
logical 
forms, 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
demonstrated 
beforehand 
by 
those 
general 
rules; 
the 
nature 
of 
each 
subject 
being 
taken 
into 
account; 
just 
as 
Euclid 
had 
a 
certain 
logic 
of 
his 
own 
concerning 
conversions, 
compositions, 
divisions 
of 
reasons, 
established 
first 
in

The 
argument 
by 
which 
Descartes 
seeks 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
material 
things 
exist 
is 
weak; 
it 
were 
better 
therefore 
not 
to 
try. 
The 
gist 
of 
the 
argument 
is 
this: 
The 
reason 
why 
we 
believe 
in 
material 
things 
is 
external 
to 
us, 
and 
hence 
either 
from 
God 
or 
from 
another 
or 
from 
things 
themselves; 
not 
from 
God, 
if 
no 
things 
exist, 
for 
he 
would 
be 
a 
deceiver; 
not 
from 
another, 
this 
he 
has 
forgotten 
to 
prove; 
therefore 
from 
themselves, 
therefore 
they 
themselves 
exist. 
It 
might 
be 
replied, 
that 
a 
sensation 
may 
be 
from 
an 
other 
than 
God, 
who 
as 
he 
permits 
all 
other 
evils 
for 
certain 
weighty 
reasons’ 
so 
may 
permit 
this 
deceiving 
of 
us 
without 
having 
the 
character 
of 
a 
deceiver, 
especially 
as 
it 
is 
joined 
with 
no 
injury, 
since 
it 
would 
rather 
be 
unpleasant 
to 
us 
not 
to 
be 
deceived. 
Besides 
the 
deception 
therein, 
which 
the 
argument 
conceals, 
is 
that 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
perceptions 
are 
from 
God 
or 
from 
another 
but 
that 
the 
judgment 
(concerning 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
sensation, 
whether 
it 
be 
from 
a 
real 
object 
outside 
of 
us), 
and 
hence 
the 
deception, 
comes 
from 
ourselves. 
Just 
as 
happens 
also 
when 
colors 
and 
other 
things 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
considered 
as 
real 
objects. 
Besides 
souls 
might 
have 
merited 
by 
previous 
sins 
that 
they 
lead 
this

full 
of 
deception 
where 
they 
snatch 
at 
shadows 
for 
things; 
to 
which 
the 
Platonists 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
averse, 
to 
whom 
this 
life 
seemed 
as 
a 
sleep

That 
body 
consists 
in 
extension 
alone 
Descartes 
tries 
to 
demonstrate 
by 
an 
enumeration 
of 
the 
other 
attributes 
which 
he 
removes, 
but 
it 
oughttohave 
beenshown 
that 
the 
enumeration 
is 
sufficient;then 
notall 
are 
well 
removed, 
certainly 
those 
who 
admit 
atoms, 
that 
is 
bodies 
of 
greatest 



hardness, 
denied 
that 
hardness 
consists 
in 
this, 
namely, 
that 
the 
body 
does 
not 
yield 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
hands, 
but 
rather 
in 
this, 
that 
it 
preserves 
its 
form. 
And 
those 
who 
place 
the 
essence 
of 
body 
in 
αντιτυπια, 
or 
impenetrability, 
do 
not 
derive 
its 
notion 
from 
our 
hands 
or 
senses 
but 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
does 
notgiveplace 
to 
another 
homogeneous 
body 
unless 
it 
itself 
can 
go 
elsewhere. 
Just 
as 
if 
we 
imagine 
that 
against 
a 
cube 
there 
run 
six 
other 
cubes 
precisely 
similar 
to 
and 
resembling 
the 
first, 
so 
that 
each 
one 
of 
them 
with 
one 
of 
its 
sides 
accurately 
coincides 
with 
one 
side 
of 
the 
intercepting 
cube; 
on 
this 
supposition 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
either 
the 
intercepting 
cube 
itself 
or 
a 
part 
of 
it 
to 
be 
moved, 
whether 
it 
be 
understood 
as 
flexible 
or 
as 
rigid. 
But 
if 
that 
middle 
cube 
be 
held 
to 
be 
penetrable 
extension 
or 
empty 
space 
then 
the 
six 
concurring 
cubes 
will 
oppose 
their 
angles 
to 
each 
other 
mutually; 
if 
however 
they 
are 
flexible, 
nothing 
will 
prevent 
the 
middle 
parts 
of 
these 
from 
breaking 
into 
the 
intercepting 
cubical 
space. 
Whence 
also 
we 
understand 
what 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
hardness, 
which 
belongs 
to 
certain 
bodies, 
and 
impenetrability, 
which 
belongs 
to 
all; 
which 
latter 
Descartes 
ought 
to 
have 
remembered 
not 
lessthan 
hardness.

Not 
a 
few 
of 
those 
who 
defend 
a 
vacuum 
consider 
space 
as 
a 
substance, 
nor 
can 
they 
be 
refuted 
by 
the 
Cartesian 
arguments; 
other 
principles 
are 
needed 
to 
end 
this 
dispute. 
They 
will 
admit 
that 
quantity 
and 
number 
do 
not 
exist 
outside 
of 
the 
things 
to 
which 
they 
are 
attributed, 
but 
they 
will 
deny 
that 
space 
or 
place 
is 
quantity 
of 
body, 
and 
they 
will 
rather 
believe 
that 
it 
has 
quantity 
or 
capacity 
and 
that 
body 
is 
equal 
to 
it 
in 
content. 
Descartes 
had 
to 
show 
that 
internal 
space 
or 
place 
does 
not 
differ 



from 
the 
substance 
of 
body. 
Those 
who 
are 
contrary 
minded 
will 
defend 
themselves 
by 
the 
common 
notion 
of 
mortals 
who 
think 
that 
body 
succeeding 
body 
passes 
over 
the 
same 
space 
and 
the 
same 
place 
which 
has 
been 
deserted 
by 
a 
previous 
body; 
but 
this 
cannot 
be 
said 
if 
space 
coincides 
with 
the 
substance 
itself 
of 
body. 
Although 
to 
have 
a 
certain 
situation 
or 
to 
be 
in 
a 
given 
place 
is 
an 
accident 
of 
body 
they 
will 
nevertheless 
no 
more 
admit 
that 
place 
itself 
is 
an 
accident 
of 
body 
than 
that 
as 
contact 
is 
an 
accident, 
so 
also 
what 
is 
touched 
is 
an 
accident. 
And 
indeed 
Descartes 
seems 
to 
me 
not 
so 
much 
to 
bring 
forward 
good 
reasons 
for 
his 
own 
opinion 
as 
to 
reply 
to 
opposing 
arguments; 
which 
in 
this 
place 
he 
does 
not 
unskillfully. 
And 
he 
often 
employs 
this 
artifice 
in 
place 
of 
demonstration. 
But 
we 
expected 
something 
more 
and 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken 
we 
were 
commanded 
to 
expect 
more. 
Tonothing, 
itmustbe 
confessed,thereisno 
extension,andthismaybe 
rightly 
hurled 
against 
those 
who 
make 
space 
an 
imaginary 
something. 
But 
those 
to 
whom 
space 
is 
a 
substance 
are 
not 
affected 
by 
this 
argument; 
they 
would 
indeed 
be 
affected 
if 
Descartes

he 
here

If 
motion 
is 
nothing 
but 
change 
of 
contact 
or 
immediate 
vicinity, 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
can 
never 
be 
determined 
which 
thing 
is 
moved. 
For 
as 
in 
astronomy 
the 
same 
phenomena 
are 
presented 
in 
different 
hypotheses, 
so 
it 
is 
always 
permissible 
to 
ascribe 
real 
motion 
to 
either 
one 
or 
other 
of 
those 
bodies 
which 
change 
among 
themselves 
vicinity 
or 
situation; 
so 
that 
one 
of 
these 
bodies 
being 
arbitrarily 
chosen 
as 
if 
at 
rest 
or, 
for 
a 
given 
reason 
moving 
in 
a 
given 
line, 
it 
may 
be 
geometrically 
determined 
what 
motion 
or 
rest 
must 
be 
ascribed 
to 
the 
others 
so 
that 
the 
given 
phenomena 
may 
appear. 
Hence 
if 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
motion 
but 
this 
respective 
change, 
it 
follows 
that 
no 
reason 
is 
given 
in 
nature 
why 
motion 
must 
be 
ascribed 
to 
one 
thing 
rather 
than 
to 
others. 
The 
consequence 
of 
this 
will 
be 
that 
there 
is 
no 
real 
motion. 
Therefore 
in 
order 
that 
a 
thing 
can 
he 
said 
to 
be 
moved, 
we 
require 
not 
only 
that 
it 
change 
its 
situation 
in 
respect 
to 
others, 
but 
also 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
change,theforceor 
action,be 
init 
itself.

ON 
ARTICLE 
45. 
Before 
I 
undertake 
to 
examine 
the 
special 
laws 
of 
motion 
laid 
down 
by 
our 
author, 
I 
will 
give 
a 
general 
criterion, 
or 
Lydian 
stone 
as 
it 
were, 
by 
which 
they 
may 
be 
examined, 
which 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
call 
the 
law 
of 
continuity. 
I 
have 
recently 
explained 
it 
elsewhere, 
but 
it 
must 
be 
repeated 
here 
and 
amplified. 
Certainly 
when 
two 
hypotheses 
or 
two 
different 
data 
continually 
by 
turns 
approach 
until 
at 
length 
one 
of 
them 
ends 
in 
the 
other, 
it 
must 
be 
also 
that 
the 
quaesita 
aut 
eventa 
of 
both 
by 
turns 
continually 
approach 
one 
another, 
and 
finally, 
that 
one 
vanishes 
in 
the 
other, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Thus 
it 
is 
with 
ellipses 
one 
focus 
of 
which 
remains 
unmoved, 



if 
the 
other 
focus 
recedes 
from 
it 
more 
and 
more, 
then 
the 
new 
ellipses 
which 
are 
thus 
produced 
will 
continually 
approach 
a 
parabola 
and 
finally 
wholly 
vanish 
in 
it, 
since 
Indeed 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
receding 
focus 
will 
have 
become 
immeasurable. 
Whence 
both 
the 
properties 
of 
Inch 
ellipses 
will 
approach 
more 
and 
more 
to 
the 
properties 
of 
a 
parabola 
so 
far 
even 
that 
they 
finally 
vanish 
in 
them, 
and 
also 
a 
parabola 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
an 
ellipse 
one 
focus 
of 
which 
is 
infinitely 
distant, 
and 
hence 
all 
the 
properties 
of 
ellipses 
may 
he 
also 
verified 
of 
a 
parabola 
as 
if 
of 
such 
an 
ellipse. 
And 
indeed 
geometry 
is 
full 
of 
examples 
of 
this 
kind; 
but 
nature, 
the 
most 
wise 
Author 
of 
which 
employs 
the 
most 
perfect 
geometry, 
observes 
the 
same, 
otherwise 
no 
ordered 
progress 
would 
be 
preserved 
in 
it. 
Thus 
motion 
gradually 
decreasing 
finally 
vanishes 
into 
rest, 
and 
inequality 
continually 
diminished 
ends 
in 
true 
equality, 
so 
that 
rest 
in 
ay 
be 
regarded 
as 
infinitely 
slight 
motion 
or 
as 
infinite 
slowness, 
and 
equality 
as 
Infinitely 
slight 
inequality; 
and 
for 
this 
reason 
whatever 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
either 
of 
motion 
in 
general 
or 
of 
inequality 
in 
general 
must 
also 
according 
to 
this 
interpretation 
be 
verified 
of 
rest 
or 
of 
equality, 
so 
that 
the 
law 
of 
rest 
or 
of 
equality 
may 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
special 
case 
of 
the 
law 
of 
motion 
or 
of 
inequality. 
But 
if 
this 
does 
not 
follow, 
it 
must 
be 
considered 
as 
certain 
that 
the 
rules 
are 
awkward 
and 
badly 
conceived. 


ON 
ARTICLE 
64. 
The 
author 
closes 
the 
Second 
and 
General 
Part 
concerning 
the 
principles 
of 
material 
things 
with 
a 
certain 
admonition 
which 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
need 
restriction. 
He 
says 
truly 
that 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
the 
phenomena 
of 
nature 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
other 
principles 
than 
those 
found 
in 
abstract 
mathematics 
or 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
magnitude, 
figure 
and 
motion. 
Nor 
does 
he 
recognize 
any 
other 
matter 
than 
that 
which 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
geometry. 
I 
indeed 
fully 
assent 
that 
all 
the 
special 
phenomena 
of 
nature 
can 
be 
explained 
mechanically 
if 
they 
are 
sufficiently 
examined 
by 
us, 
nor 
can 



the 
causes 
of 
material 
things 
be 
understood 
in 
any 
other 
way. 
But 
I 
think 
also 
that 
this 
ought 
to 
be 
repeatedly 
considered, 
that 
the 
very 
mechanical 
principles 
and 
hence 
the 
general 
laws 
of 
nature 
are 
derived 
from 
higher 
principles, 
nor 
can 
they 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
mere 
consideration 
of 
quantity 
and 
of 
that 
which 
is 
geometrical, 
but 
that 
there 
is 
rather 
in 
them 
something 
metaphysical, 
independent 
of 
the 
notions 
which 
the 
imagination 
presents 
and 
which 
must 
be 
referred 
to 
a 
substance 
destitute 
of 
extension. 
For 
in 
addition 
to 
extension 
and 
its 
variations 
there 
is 
in 
matter 
force 
itself 
or 
power 
of 
acting 
which 
forms 
a 
transition 
from 
metaphysics 
to 
nature, 
from 
material 
things 
to 
immaterial. 
This 
force 
has 
its 
own 
laws 
derived 
from 
principles 
not 
of 
mere 
absolute 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
brute 
necessity 
as 
in 
mathematics 
but 
of 
perfect 
reason. 
But 
these 
being 
embraced 
together 
in 
a 
general 
discussion, 
afterwards 
when 
a 
reason 
is 
given 
for 
the 
phenomena 
of 
nature, 
all 
can 
be 
explained 
mechanically, 
and 
as 
vainly 
as 
fundamental 
(archaei) 
perceptions 
and 
desires, 
and 
operating 
ideas, 
and 
forms 
of 
substances, 
and 
souls 
also 
are 
then 
employed, 
so 
vainly 
would 
we 
call 
in 
the 
universal 
cause 
of 
all, 
as 
a 
Deus 
ex 
machina, 
to 
explain 
each 
natural 
thing 
by 
his 
simple 
will, 
which 
I 
remember 
the 
author 
of 
Philosophia 
Mosaica 
does, 
the 
words 
of 
Sacred 
Scripture 
being 
badly 
understood. 
He 
who 
will 
consider 
this 
properly 
will 
hold 
a 
middle 
position 
in 
philosophy 
and 
will 
satisfy 
theology 
no 
less 
than 
physics, 
and 
he 
will 
understand 
that 
it 
was 
not 
so 
much 
a 
sin 
of 
the 
schoolmen 
to 
hold 
the 
doctrine 
of 
intelligible 
forms 
as 
to 
apply 
it 
as 
they 
did, 
at 
the 
time 
when 
the 
inquiry 
was 
rather 
of 
the 
modifications 
and 
instruments 
of 
substance 
and 
its 
manner 
of 
acting, 
that 
is, 
its 
mechanism. 
Nature 
has 
as 
it 
were 
an 
empire 
within 
an 
empire, 
and 
so 
to 
say 
a 
double 
kingdom, 
of 
reason 
and 
of 
necessity, 
or 
of 
forms 
and 
of 
particles 
of 
matter; 
for 
just 
as 
all 
things 
are 
full 
of 
spirits, 
so 
also 
they 
are 
full 
of 
organized 
bodies. 
These 
realms 
without 
confusion 
between 
them 
are 
governed 
each 
by 
its 
own 
law, 
nor 
is 
the 
reason 
of 



perception 
and 
of 
desire 
in 
the 
modifications 
of 
extension, 
any 
more 
than 
the 
reason 
of 
nutrition 
and 
of 
other 
organic 
functions 
are 
to 
be 
found 
in 
forms 
or 
spirits. 
But 
this 
highest 
substance, 
which 
is 
the 
universal 
cause 
of 
all, 
brings 
it 
about 
by 
his 
infinite 
wisdom 
and 
power 
that 
these 
two 
very 
different 
series 
arereferred 
to 
the 
same 
corporealsubstance 
andperfectly 
harmonize 
between 
themselves 
just 
as 
if 
one 
was 
controlled 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
other; 
and 
if 
you 
observe 
the 
necessity 
of 
matter 
and 
the 
order 
of 
efficient 
powers, 
you 
observe 
that 
nothing 
happens 
without 
a 
cause 
satisfying 
the 
imagination 
and 
except 
on 
account 
of 
the 
mathematical 
laws 
of 
mechanism; 
or 
if 
you 
regard 
the 
circle 
of 
ends 
as 
a 
golden 
chain 
and 
of 
forms 
as 
an 
intelligible 
world, 
the 
apexes 
of 
ethics 
and 
of 
metaphysics 
being 
joined 
in 
one 
on 
account 
of 
the 
perfection 
of 
thesupreme 
author, 
you 
notice 
thatnothing 
can 
be 
done 
without 
the 
highest 
reason. 
For 
GOD 
and 
eminent 
form 
and 
first 
efficient 
are 
the 
same, 
and 
he 
is 
the 
end 
or 
final 
reason 
of 
things. 
Moreover 
it 
is 
our 
part 
to 
reverence 
his 
footprints 
in 
things, 
and 
not 
only 
to 
admire 
his 
instruments 
in 
operating 
and 
the 
mechanical 
cause 
of 
material 
things, 
but 
also 
the 
higher 
uses 
of 
admirable 
ingenuity, 
and 
as 
we 
recognize 
God 
as 
the 
architect 
of 
bodies 
so 
also 
to 
recognize 
him 
especially 
as 
the 
king 
of 
minds 
and 
his 
intelligence 
as 
ruling 
all 
things 
for 
the 
best, 
which 
constitutes 
the 
most 
perfect 
Republic 
of 
the 
Universe 
under 
the 
most 
powerful 
and 
wisest 
of 
Monarchs. 
Thus 
in 
the 
particular 
phenomena 
of 
nature 
and 
in 
the 
connection 
of 
each 
consideration, 
we 
shall 
consult 
equally 
utility 
of 
life 
and 
perfection 
of 
mind,andwisdomnolessthanpiety. 



LEIBNITZ’S 
REPLY

THE 
EXTRACT 
FROM 
THE 
LETTER 
OFM. 
FOUCHER, 
CANON 
OF 
DIJON, 
PUBLISHED 
IN 
THE 
“JOURNAL” 
OFMARCH

[FromtheFrench.] 



ONE 
OUGHT 
TO 
be 
very 
glad, 
sir, 
that 
you 
give 
a 
reasonable 
meaning 
to 
the 
doubt 
of 
the 
Academicians. 
It 
is 
the 
best 
apology 
that 
you 
could 
make 
for 
them. 
I 
shall 
be 
charmed 
to 
see 
sometime 
their 
views 
digested 
and 
made 
clear 
by 
your 
pains. 
But 
you 
will 
be 
obliged 
from 
time 
to 
time 
to 
lend 
them 
some 
rayofyour 
light,asyouhavebeguntodo. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
I 
wrote 
two 
little 
discourses, 
twenty 
years 
ago, 
one 
on 
the 
theory 
of 
abstract 
motion, 
wherein 
I 
considered 
it 
as 
outside 
of 
the 
system, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
thing 
purely 
mathematical; 
the 
other 
on 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
concrete 
and 
systematic 
motion, 
such 
as 
really 
is 
met 
with 
in 
nature. 
There 
may 
he 
some 
good 
in 
them 
since 
you 
with 
others 
judge 
so. 
However 
there 
are 
many 
points 
on 
which 
I 
believe 
that 
I 
am 
better 
instructed 
at 
present, 
and 
among 
others 
I 
explain 
to-day 
indivisibles 
in 
an 
entirely 
different 
way. 
That 
was 
the 
attempt 
of 
a 
young 
man 
who 
had 
not 
yet 
fathomed 
mathematics. 
The 
laws 
of 
abstract 
motion 
which 
I 
gave 
at 
that 
time 
would 
really 
hold 
good 
if 
there 
was 
nothing 
else 
in 
body 
but 
what 
is 
conceived 
there 
according 
to 
Descartes 
and 
even 
according 
to 
Gassendi. 
But 
as 
I 
have 
found 
that 
nature 
treats 
body 
quite 
differently 
as 
regards 
motion 
it 
is 
one 
of 
my 
arguments 
against 
the 
received 
notion 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
body, 
as 
I 
have 
indicated 
in 
the 
Journal 
des 
Savons 
of 
June2,1692. 


As 
regards 
indivisibles, 
when 
by 
that 
word 
is 
understood 
simple 
extremities 
of 
time 
or 
of 
line, 
new 
extremities 
could 
not 
be 
conceived 
in 



them, 
nor 
actual 
nor 
pretended 
parts. 
Thus 
points 
are 
neither 
large 
nor 
small, 
and 
there 
needs 
no 
leap 
to 
pass 
them. 
However, 
although 
there 
are 
such 
indivisibles 
everywhere, 
continuity 
is 
not 
composed 
of 
them, 
as 
the 
objections 
of 
the 
sceptics 
appear 
to 
suppose. 
In 
my 
opinion 
these 
objections 
have 
nothing 
insurmountable 
about 
them, 
as 
will 
be 
found 
by 
reducing 
them 
to 
form. 
Gregory 
of 
St. 
Vincent 
has 
well 
shown 
by 
the 
calculations 
even 
of 
divisibility 
ad 
infinitum, 
the 
place 
where 
Achilles 
ought 
to 
overtake 
the 
tortoise 
which 
precedes 
him, 
according 
to 
the 
proportion 
of 
velocities. 
Thus 
geometryserves 
todissipate 
these 
apparentdifficulties. 


I 
am 
so 
much 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
actual 
infinite 
that 
instead 
of 
admitting 
that 
nature 
abhors 
it, 
as 
is 
commonly 
said, 
I 
hold 
that 
it 
affects 
it 
everywhere 
in 
order 
better 
to 
mark 
the 
perfections 
of 
its 
author. 
So 
I 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
no 
part 
of 
matter 
which 
is 
not, 
I 
do 
not 
say 
divisible, 
but 
actually 
divided; 
and 
consequently 
the 
least 
particle 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
world 
full 
of 
an 
infinity 
ofdifferentcreatures. 



EXTRACTFROM 
A 
LETTER 
TO 
THE 
ABBE 
NICAISEON 


THE 
PHILOSOPHY 
OF 
DESCARTES. 
1793. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



I 
HONOR 
EXCEEDINGLY 
the 
Bishop 
d’Avranches, 
and 
I 
beg 
you, 
sir, 
to 
give 
him 
my 
respects 
when 
occasion 
offers. 
One 
of 
my 
friends 
in 
Bremen 
having 
sent 
me 
the 
book 
of 
Herr 
Swelling, 
professor 
there, 
against 
the 
censure 
of 
that 
illustrious 
prelate, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
my 
opinion 
of 
it, 
I 
replied 
that 
the 
best 
answer 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
could 
make 
would 
be 
to 
profit 
by 
the 
advice 
of 
d’Avranches; 
to 
emancipate 
themselves 
from 
the 
spirit 
of 
sect, 
always 
contrary 
to 
the 
advancement 
of 
the 
sciences; 
to 
unite 
to 
the 
reading 
of 
the 
excellent 
works 
of 
Descartes 
that 
of 
some 
other 
great 
men, 
ancient 
and 
modern; 
not 
to 
despise 
antiquity, 
whence 
Descartes 
has 
taken 
a 
good 
part 
of 
his 
best 
thoughts; 
to 
give 
themselves 
to 
experiments 
and 
to 
demonstrations 
in 
place 
of 
those 
general 
reasonings 
which 
serve 
but 
to 
support 
idleness 
and 
to 
cover 
up 
ignorance; 
to 
try 
to 
make 
some 
advance 
and 
not 
to 
content 
themselves 
with 
being 
simple 
paraphrasera 
of 
their 
master, 
and 
not 
to 
neglect 
or 
despise 
anatomy, 
history, 
the 
languages, 
criticism, 
for 
want 
of 
knowing 
their 
importance 
and 
value; 
not 
to 
imagine 
that 
we 
know 
all 
that 
is 
necessary 
or 
allwe 
mayhope 
to;finally,tobe 
modestandstudious, 
in 
order 
nottodraw 
upon 
themselves 
this 
apt 
saying: 
Ignorantia 
inflat. 
I 
shall 
add 
that 
I 
do 
not 
know 
how 
or 
by 
what 
star, 
the 
influence 
of 
which 
is 
the 
enemy 
of 
every 
sort 
of 
secret, 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
done 
almost 
nothing 
that 
is 
new, 
and 
that 
almost 
all 
the 
discoveries 
have 
been 
made 
by 
persons 
not 
of 
the 
sect. 
I 
know 
but 
the 
little 
pipes 
of 
M. 
Rohault, 
which 
do 
not 
deserve 
the 
name 
of 
a 
Cartesian 
discovery. 
It 
seems 
that 
those 
who 
attach 
themselves 
to 
a 
single 



master 
abase 
themselves 
by 
this 
kind 
of 
slavery 
and 
conceive 
almost 
nothing 
except 
in 
imitation 
of 
him. 
I 
am 
sure 
that 
if 
Descartes 
had 
lived 
longer 
he 
would 
have 
given 
us 
many 
important 
things. 
This 
shows 
us 
either 
that 
it 
was 
rather 
his 
genius 
than 
his 
method, 
or 
else 
that 
he 
has 
not 
published 
his 
method. 
In 
fact 
I 
remember 
having 
read 
in 
one 
of 
his 
letters 
that 
he 
intended 
simply 
to 
write 
a 
discourse 
on 
his 
method, 
and 
to 
give 
some 
examples 
of 
it; 
but 
that 
he 
had 
no 
intention 
of 
publishing 
it. 
Thus 
the 
Cartesians 
who 
think 
that 
they 
have 
the 
method 
of 
their 
master 
deceive 
themselves 
very 
much. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
imagine 
that 
this 
method 
was 
not 
so 
perfect 
as 
we 
are 
made 
to 
believe. 
I 
think 
so 
from 
his 
geometry. 
This 
is, 
without 
doubt, 
his 
strong 
point; 
nevertheless 
we 
know 
to-day 
that 
it 
is 
very 
far 
from 
going 
as 
far 
as 
it 
ought 
to 
go 
and 
as 
he 
said 
it 
went. 
The 
most 
important 
problems 
need 
a 
new 
sort 
of 
analysisentirely 
differentfrom 
his, 
examples 
ofwhich 
I 
myself 
havegiven. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
Descartes 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
penetrate 
the 
important 
truths 
of 
Kepler 
on 
astronomy 
which 
the 
course 
of 
time 
has 
verified. 
His 
“Man” 
is 
very 
different 
from 
the 
true 
man, 
as 
M. 
Stenon 
and 
others 
have 
shown 
it 
to 
be. 
The 
knowledge 
he 
had 
of 
salts 
and 
chemistry 
was 
very 
meagre; 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
that 
what 
he 
says 
thereon, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
minerals, 
is 
mediocre. 
The 
metaphysics 
of 
this 
author, 
although 
it 
has 
some 
fine 
traits 
is 
intermingled 
with 
great 
paralogisms, 
and 
has 
some 
very 
weak 
passages. 
I 
have 
discovered 
the 
source 
of 
his 
errors 
as 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
motion, 
and 
although 
I 
esteem 
very 
highly 
his 
physics 
it 
is 
not 
because 
I 
regard 
it 
as 
true, 
except 
in 
some 
particular 
things, 
but 
because 
I 
consider 
it 
as 
an 
admirable 
model 
and 
as 
an 
example 
of 
what 
could 
and 
ought 
now 
to 
be 
produced 
on 
principles 
more 
solid 
than 
experiments 
have 
thus 
far 
furnished 
us 
with. 
In 
a 
word, 
I 
esteem 
Descartes 
very 
highly, 
but 
very 
often 
it 
is 
not 
permitted 
me 
to 
follow 
him. 
I 
have 
in 
the 
past 
made 
remarks 
on 
the 
first 
and 
second 
parts 
of 
his 
“Principles.” 
The 
parts 
comprise, 
in 
epitome, 
his 
general 
philosophy, 
in 



which 
I 
have 
most 
often 
been 
obliged 
to 
separate 
myself 
from 
him. 
The 
following 
parts 
come 
to 
the 
detail 
of 
nature, 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
so 
easily 
explained. 
This 
is 
why 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
touched 
it. 
But 
I 
do 
not 
know 
how 
I

ON 
THEREFORM 
OFMETAPHYSICS 
AND 
OF 
THE 
NOTION 
OF 
SUBSTANCE. 
1694. 


[From 
the 
Latin.] 



ISEE 
THAT 
mostofthosewhodevotethemselveswithpleasuretothestudy 
of 
mathematics 
entertain 
a 
dislike 
for 
that 
of 
metaphysics 
because 
in 
the 
former 
they 
find 
clearness 
and 
in 
the 
latter 
obscurity. 
I 
think 
that 
the 
principal 
reason 
of 
this 
is 
that 
general 
notions, 
which 
are 
believed 
to 
be 
perfectly 
known 
by 
all, 
have 
become 
ambiguous 
and 
obscure 
by 
the 
negligence 
of 
men 
and 
by 
the 
inconsistency 
of 
their 
thoughts, 
and 
that 
what 
are 
ordinarily 
given 
as 
definitions 
are 
not 
even 
nominal 
definitions, 
because 
they 
explain 
absolutely 
nothing. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
wondered 
at 
that 
this 
evil 
has 
spread 
into 
the 
other 
sciences, 
which 
are 
subordinate 
to 
this 
first 
and 
architectonic 
science. 
Thus 
we 
have 
subtile 
distinctions 
in 
place 
of 
clear 
definitions, 
and 
in 
place 
of 
truly 
universal 
axioms 
we 
have 
general 
rules 
which 
are 
more 
often 
broken 
by 
exceptions 
than 
supported 
by 
examples. 
And 
yet 
men 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
necessity 
frequently 
make 
use 
of 
metaphysical 
terms, 
and 
flatter 
themselves 
that 
they 
understand 
what 
they 
have 
learned 
to 
say. 
And 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
the 
true 
and 
fruitful 
meanings 
not 
only 
of 
substance 
but 
also 
of 
cause, 
of 
action, 
of 
relation, 
of 
similarity 
and 
most 
other 
general 
terms, 
he 
for 
the 
most 
part 
hidden. 
Whence 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
this 
queen 
of 
the 
sciences, 
which 
is 
called 
first 
philosophy 
and 
which 
Aristotle 
defined 
as 
the 
science 
desired 
or 
to 
be 
sought 
for 
remains 
to-day 
in 
the 
number 
of 
the 
sciences 
sought. 
Plato, 
it 
is 
true, 
often 
in 
his 
Dialogues 
inquires 
into 
the 
value 
of 
notions; 
Aristotle 
does 
the 
same 
in 
his 
books 
entitled 
Metaphysics; 
nevertheless, 
without 
much 
apparent 
profit. 
The 
later 
Platonists 
fall 
into 
monstrosities 
of 
language, 
and 



the 
disciples 
of 
Aristotle, 
especially 
the 
Scholastics, 
were 
more 
desirous 
of 
raising 
questions 
than 
of 
answering 
them. 
In 
our 
day 
some 
illustrious 
men 
have 
also 
devoted 
themselves 
to 
the 
first 
philosophy, 
but 
up 
to 
the 
present 
time 
without 
much 
success. 
It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
Descartes 
brought 
to 
it 
many 
excellent 
things; 
that 
he 
has 
above 
all 
the 
merit 
of 
having 
renewed 
Platonic 
study 
by 
turning 
the 
mind 
away 
from 
the 
things 
of 
sense 
and 
of 
having 
afterwards 
employed 
usefully 
academic 
scepticism; 
but 
soon, 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
inconsistency 
or 
of 
impatience 
to 
affirm, 
he 
was 
led 
astray, 
no 
longer 
distinguishing 
the 
certain 
from 
the 
uncertain, 
and 
hence 
making 
the 
nature 
of 
corporeal 
substance 
incorrectly 
consist 
in 
extension 
and 
holding 
a 
false 
conception 
of 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
the 
cause 
of 
which 
was 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
substance 
in 
general 
was 
not 
understood. 
For 
he 
had 
proceeded 
at 
a 
bound, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
gravest 
questions, 
without 
having 
explained 
the 
notions 
which 
they 
implied. 
Hence, 
nothing 
shows 
more 
clearly 
how 
far 
his 
metaphysical 
meditations 
are 
removed 
from 
certainty 
than 
the 
writing 
in 
which, 
at 
the 
prayer 
of 
Mersenne 
and 
others, 
he 
vainly 
tried 
to 
clothe 
them 
with 
a 
mathematical 
garb. 
I 
see 
also 
that 
other 
men 
gifted 
with 
rare 
penetration 
have 
broached 
metaphysics 
and 
treated 
some 
parts 
of 
it 
with 
profoundness, 
but 
enveloping 
them 
with 
so 
much 
obscurity 
that 
they 
appear 
to 
surmise 
rather 
than 
to 
prove. 
But 
metaphysics, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
has 
more 
need 
of 
clearness 
and 
certainty 
than 
even 
the 
mathematics, 
because 
the 
latter 
carry 
with 
them 
their 
proofs 
and 
corroborations 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
cause 
of 
their 
success; 
whereas 
in 
metaphysics 
we 
are 
deprived 
of 
this 
advantage. 
Therefore 
a 
certain 
particular 
plan 
is 
necessary 
in 
exposition 
which, 
like 
the 
thread 
in 
the 
Labyrinth, 
serves 
us, 
no 
less 
than 
the 
method 
of 
Euclid, 
for 
resolving 
our 
problems 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
calculus, 
preserving, 
nevertheless, 
always 
the 
clearness 
which 
even 
in 
common 
conversation 
should 
not 
be 
sacrificed. 



How 
important 
these 
things 
are 
is 
apparent, 
especially 
from 
the 
notion 
of 
substance 
which 
I 
give, 
because 
it 
is 
so 
fruitful 
that 
from 
it 
first 
truths, 
even 
those 
which 
concern 
God 
and 
souls 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
bodies, 
follow; 
truths 
in 
part 
known 
but 
not 
sufficiently 
proved; 
in 
part 
unknown 
up 
to 
this 
time 
but 
which 
would 
be 
of 
the 
greatest 
usefulness 
in 
the 
other 
sciences. 
To 
give 
a 
foretaste 
of 
them, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
for 
me 
to 
say 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
energy 
or 
virtue, 
called 
by 
the 
Germans 
kraft, 
and 
by 
the 
French 
la 
force, 
and 
for 
the 
explanation 
of 
which 
I 
have 
designed 
a 
special 
science 
of 
dynamics, 
adds 
much 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
substance. 
For 
active 
force 
differs 
from 
the 
bare 
power 
familiar 
to 
the 
schools, 
in 
that 
the 
active 
power 
or 
faculty 
of 
the 
scholastics 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
possibility 
ready 
to 
act, 
which 
has 
nevertheless 
need, 
in 
order 
to 
pass 
into 
action, 
of 
an 
external 
excitation, 
and 
as 
it 
were 
of 
a 
stimulus. 
But 
active 
force 
includes 
a 
sort 
of 
act, 
which 
is 
midway 
between 
the 
faculty 
of 
acting 
and 
the 
action 
itself, 
and 
involves 
an 
effort, 
and 
thus 
of 
itself 
passes 
into 
operation; 
nor 
does 
it 
need 
aid 
other 
than 
the 
removal 
of 
impediments. 
This 
may 
be 
illustrated 
by 
the 
example 
of 
a 
heavy 
hanging 
body 
straining 
the 
rope 
which 
sustains 
it, 
or 
a 
tense 
bow. 
For 
although 
gravity 
or 
elastic 
force 
may 
and 
must 
be 
explained 
mechanically 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
ether, 
nevertheless 
the 
final 
reason 
of 
motion 
in 
matter 
is 
the 
force 
impressed 
upon 
it 
at 
the 
creation, 
a 
force 
inherent 
in 
every 
body, 
but 
which 
is 
variously 
limited 
and 
confined 
in 
nature 
by 
the 
very 
meeting 
of 
bodies. 
I 
say, 
then, 
that 
this 
property 
of 
acting 
resides 
in 
every 
substance, 
that 
always 
some 
sort 
of 
action 
is 
born 
of 
it; 
and 
that, 
consequently, 
corporeal 
substance, 
no 
less 
than 
spiritual, 
never 
ceases 
to 
act; 
a 
truth 
which 
those 
who 
place 
its 
essence 
in 
mere 
extension 
or 
even 
in 
impenetrability, 
and 
who 
have 
imagined 
that 
they 
conceived 
of 
body 
absolutely 
at 
rest, 
seem 
not 
to 
have 
sufficiently 
understood. 
It 
will 
appear 
also 
from 
our 
meditations 
that 
a 
created 
substance 
receives 
from 
another 



created 
substance, 
not 
the 
force 
itself 
of 
acting 
but 
only 
the 
limits 
and 
determination 
of 
an 
already 
pre-existent 
tendency 
or 
virtue 
of 
acting. 
I 
omit 
here 
other 
considerations 
useful 
for 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
difficult 
problem 
concerningthemutual 
operation 
ofsubstances. 



A 
NEW 
SYSTEM 
OF 
NATURE, 
AND 
OF 
THE 


INTERACTION 
OF 
SUBSTANCES, 
AS 
WELL 
AS 
OF 
THE 
UNION 
WHICH 
EXISTS 
BETWEEN 
THE 
SOULAND 
THE 
BODY. 
1695. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



1. 
I 
CONCEIVED 
this 
System 
many 
years 
ago 
and 
communicated 
it 
to 
some 
learned 
men, 
and 
in 
particular 
to 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
theologians 
and 
philosophers 
of 
our 
time, 
who, 
having 
been 
informed 
of 
some 
of 
my 
opinions 
by 
a 
very 
distinguished 
person, 
had 
found 
them 
highly 
paradoxical. 
When, 
however, 
he 
had 
received 
my 
explanations, 
he 
withdrew 
his 
condemnation 
in 
the 
most 
generous 
and 
edifying 
manner; 
and, 
having 
approved 
a 
part 
of 
my 
propositions, 
he 
ceased 
censuring 
the 
others 
with 
which 
he 
was 
not 
yet 
in 
accord. 
Since 
that 
time 
I 
have 
continued 
my 
meditations 
as 
far 
as 
opportunity 
has 
permitted, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
to 
the 
public 
only 
thoroughly 
examined 
views, 
and 
I 
have 
also 
tried 
to 
answer 
the 
objections 
made 
against 
my 
essays 
in 
dynamics, 
which 
are 
related 
to 
the 
former. 
Finally, 
as 
a 
number 
of 
persons 
have 
desired 
to 
see 
my 
opinions 
more 
clearly 
explained, 
I 
have 
ventured 
to 
publish 
these 
meditations 
although 
they 
are 
not 
at 
all 
popular 
nor 
fit 
to 
be 
enjoyed 
by 
every 
sort 
of 
mind. 
I 
have 
been 
led 
to 
do 
this 
principally 
in 
order 
that 
Imightprofit 
bythe 
judgments 
of 
thosewhoarelearned 
in 
these 
matters, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
would 
be 
too 
inconvenient 
to 
seek 
and 
challenge 
separately 
those 
who 
would 
be 
disposed 
to 
give 
the 
instructions 
which 
I 
shall 
always 
be 
glad 
to 
receive, 
provided 
the 
love 
of 
truth 
appears 
in 
them 
rather 
than 
passion 
foropinions 
already 
held. 

2. 
Although 
I 
am 
one 
of 
those 
who 
have 
worked 
very 
hard 
at 
mathematics 
I 
have 
not 
since 
my 
youth 
ceased 
to 
meditate 
on 
philosophy, 
for 
it 
always 
seemed 
to 
me 
that 
there 
was 
a 
way 
to 
establish 
in 
it, 
by 
clear 
demonstrations, 
something 
stable. 
I 
had 
penetrated 
well 
into 
the 
territory 
of 
the 
scholastics 
when 
mathematics 
and 
modern 
authors 
induced 
me 
while 
yet 
young 
to 
withdraw 
fromit. 
Their 
fineways 
of 
explainingnaturemechanically 
charmed 
me; 
and, 
with 
reason, 
I 
scorned 
the 
method 
of 
those 
who 
employ 
only 
forms 
or 
faculties, 
by 
which 
nothing 
is 
learned. 
But 
afterwards, 
when 
I 
tried 
to 
search 
into 
the 
principles 
of 
mechanics 
to 
find 
proof 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
which 
experience 
made 
known, 
I 
perceived 
that 
the 
mere 
consideration 
of 
an 
extended 
mass 
did 
not 
suffice 
and 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
employ 
in 
addition 
thenotionof 
force, 
which 
is 
very 
easily 
understood 
although 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
province 
of 
metaphysics. 
It 
seemed 
to 
me 
also 
that 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
transform 
or 
degrade 
animals 
into 
simple 
machines, 
notwithstanding 
its 
seeming 
possibility, 
is 
contrary 
to 
appearances 
and 
even 
opposed 
to 
the 
order 
ofthings. 
3. 
In 
the 
beginning, 
when 
I 
had 
freed 
myself 
from 
the 
yoke 
of 
Aristotle, 
I 
occupied 
myself 
with 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
void 
and 
atoms, 
for 
this 
is 
what 
best 
fills 
the 
imagination; 
but 
after 
many 
meditations 
I 
perceived 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
find 
the 
principles 
of 
true 
‘unity 
in 
mere 
matter, 
or 
in 
that 
which 
is 
only 
passive, 
because 
there 
everything 
is 
but 
a 
collection 
or 
mass 
of 
parts 
ad 
infinitum. 
Now, 
multiplicity 
cannot 
have 
its 
reality 
except 
from 
real 
unities, 
which 
originate 
otherwise 
and 
are 
entirely 
different 
things 
from 
the 
points 
of 
which 
it 
is 
certain 
the 
continuum 
could 
not 
be 
composed. 
Therefore, 
in 
order 
to 
find 
these 
real 
unities 
I 
was 
compelled 
to 
resort 
to 
a 
formal 
atom, 
since 
a 
material 
being 
could 
not 
be 
at 
the 
same 
time 
material 
and 
perfectly 
indivisible, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
endowed 
with 
true 
unity. 
It 
became 
necessary, 
therefore, 
to 
recall 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
reinstate 
the 
substantial 
forms, 
so 
decried 

now-a-days, 
but 
in 
a 
way 
to 
render 
them 
intelligible, 
and 
distinguish 
the 
use 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
made 
of 
them 
from 
the 
abuse 
which 
had 
befallen 
them. 
I 
foundthen 
thattheir 
nature 
is 
force 
andthatfrom 
this 
something 
analagous 
to 
sensation 
and 
desire 
results, 
and 
that 
therefore 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
conceive 
them 
similarly 
to 
the 
idea 
which 
we 
have 
of 
souls. 
But 
as 
the 
soul 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
employed 
to 
explain 
the 
details 
of 
the 
economy 
of 
the 
animal 
body, 
likewise 
I 
judged 
that 
it 
was 
not 
necessary 
to 
employ 
these 
forms 
to 
explain 
particular 
problems 
in 
nature 
although 
they 
are 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
true 
general 
principles. 
Aristotle 
calls 
them 
the 
first 
entelechies. 
I 
call 
them, 
perhaps 
more 
intelligibly, 
primitive 
forces 
which 
contain 
in 
themselves 
not 
onlythe 
act 
or 
complementof 
possibility,butalsoanoriginal 
activity. 


4. 
I 
saw 
that 
these 
forms 
and 
these 
souls 
ought 
to 
be 
indivisible, 
just 
as 
much 
as 
our 
mind, 
as 
in 
truth 
I 
remembered 
was 
the 
opinion 
of 
St. 
Thomas 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
souls 
of 
brutes. 
But 
this 
innovation 
renewed 
the 
great 
difficulties 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
origin 
and 
duration 
of 
souls 
and 
of 
forms. 
For 
every 
simple 
substance 
which 
has 
true 
unity 
cannot 
begin 
or 
end 
except 
by 
miracle; 
it 
follows, 
therefore, 
that 
it 
cannot 
begin 
except 
by 
creation, 
nor 
end 
except 
by 
annihilation. 
Therefore, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
souls 
which 
God 
might 
still 
be 
pleased 
to 
create 
expressly, 
I 
was 
obliged 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
constitutive 
forms 
of 
substances 
must 
have 
been 
created 
with 
the 
world, 
and 
that 
they 
must 
exist 
always. 
Certain 
scholastics, 
like 
Albertus 
Magnus 
and 
John 
Bacon, 
had 
also 
foreseen 
a 
part 
of 
the 
truth 
as 
to 
their 
origin. 
And 
the 
matter 
ought 
not 
to 
appear 
at 
all 
extraordinary 
for 
only 
the 
same 
duration 
which 
the 
Gassendistsaccordtheiratomsisgiventotheseforms. 
5. 
I 
was 
of 
the 
opinion, 
nevertheless, 
that 
neither 
spirits 
nor 
the 
rational 
soul, 
which 
belong 
to 
a 
superior 
order 
and 
have 
incomparably 
more 
perfection 
than 
these 
forms 
implanted 
in 
matter 
which 
in 
my 
opinion 
are 
found 
everywhere 
— 
being 
in 
comparison 
with 
them, 
like 
little 
gods 
made 
in 

the 
image 
of 
God 
and 
having 
within 
them 
some 
rays 
of 
the 
light 
of 
divinity, 
ought 
to 
be 
mixed 
up 
indifferently 
or 
confounded 
with 
other 
forms 
or 
souls. 
This 
is 
why 
God 
governs 
spirits 
as 
a 
prince 
governs 
his 
subjects, 
and 
even 
as 
a 
father 
cares 
for 
his 
children; 
while 
he 
disposes 
of 
the 
other 
substances 
as 
an 
engineer 
manipulates 
his 
machines. 
Thus 
spirits 
have 
peculiar 
laws 
which 
place 
them 
above 
the 
changes 
which 
matter 
undergoes, 
and 
indeed 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
all 
other 
things 
are 
made 
only 
for 
them, 
the 
changes 
even 
being 
adaptedtothefelicityofthegood 
andthepunishment,ofthebad. 


6. 
However, 
to 
return 
to 
ordinary 
forms 
or 
to 
material 
souls 
[ames 
brutes], 
the 
duration 
which 
must 
be 
attributed 
to 
them 
in 
place 
of 
that 
which 
had 
been 
attributed 
to 
atoms, 
might 
raise 
the 
question 
as 
to 
whether 
they 
pass 
from 
body 
to 
body, 
which 
would 
be 
metempsychosis 
— 
very 
like 
the 
belief 
of 
certain 
philosophers 
in 
the 
transmission 
of 
motion 
and 
of 
the 
species. 
But 
this 
fancyisvery 
far 
removedfromthenature 
ofthings. 
Thereisnosuch 
passage; 
and 
here 
it 
is 
that 
the 
transformations 
of 
Swammerdam, 
Malpighi 
and 
Leewenhoeck, 
who 
are 
the 
best 
observers 
of 
our 
time, 
have 
come 
to 
my 
aid 
and 
have 
made 
me 
admit 
more 
easily 
that 
the 
animal 
and 
every 
other 
organized 
substance 
does 
not 
at 
all 
begin 
when 
we 
think 
it 
does, 
and 
that 
its 
apparent 
generation 
is 
only 
a 
development 
and 
a 
sort 
of 
augmentation. 
Also 
I 
have 
noticed 
that 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Search 
after 
Truth 
[i.e. 
Malebranche], 
Rigis, 
Hartsoeker 
and 
other 
able 
men, 
have 
not 
been 
far 
removed 
from 
this 
opinion. 
7. 
But 
the 
most 
important 
question 
of 
all 
still 
remained: 
What 
do 
these 
souls 
or 
these 
forms 
become 
after 
the 
death 
of 
the 
animal 
or 
after 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
individual 
of 
the 
organized 
substance? 
It 
is 
this 
question 
which 
is 
most 
embarrassing, 
all 
the 
more 
so 
as 
it 
seems 
unreasonable 
that 
souls 
should 
remain 
uselessly 
in 
a 
chaos 
of 
confused 
matter. 
This 
obliged 
me 
finally 
to 
believe 
that 
there 
was 
only 
one 
reasonable 
opinion 
to 
hold, 
namely, 

that 
not 
only 
the 
soul 
but 
also 
the 
animal 
itself 
and 
its 
organic 
machine 
were 
preserved, 
although 
the 
destruction 
of 
its 
gross 
parts 
had 
rendered 
it 
so 
small 
as 
to 
escape 
our 
senses 
now 
just 
as 
much 
as 
it 
did 
before 
it 
was 
born. 
Also 
there 
is 
no 
person 
who 
can 
accurately 
note 
the 
true 
time 
of 
death, 
which 
can 
be 
considered 
for 
a 
long 
time 
solely 
as 
a 
suspension 
of 
visible 
actions, 
and 
indeed 
is 
never 
anything 
else 
in 
mere 
animals; 
witness 
the 
resuscitation 
of 
drowned 
flies 
after 
being 
buried 
under 
pulverized 
chalk, 
and 
other 
similar 
examples, 
which 
make 
it 
sufficiently 
clear 
that 
there 
would 
be 
many 
more 
resuscitations 
and 
of 
far 
more 
intricacy 
if 
men 
were 
in 
condition 
to 
set 
the 
machine 
going 
again. 
And 
apparently 
it 
was 
of 
something 
of 
this 
sort 
that 
the 
great 
Democritus, 
atomist 
as 
he 
was, 
spoke, 
although 
Pliny 
makes 
sport 
of 
the 
idea. 
It 
is 
then 
natural 
that 
the 
animal 
having, 
as 
people 
of 
great 
penetration 
begin 
to 
recognize, 
been 
always 
living 
and 
organized, 
should 
so 
remain 
always. 
And 
since, 
therefore, 
there 
is 
no 
first 
birth 
nor 
entirely 
new 
generation 
of 
the 
animal, 
it 
follows 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
final 
extinction 
nor 
complete 
death 
taken 
in 
its 
metaphysical 
rigor, 
and 
that 
in 
consequence 
instead 
of 
the 
transmigration 
of 
souls 
there 
is 
only 
a 
transformation 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
animal, 
according 
as 
its 
organs 
are 
folded 
differently 
and 
more 
orless-developed. 


8. 
Nevertheless, 
rational 
souls 
follow 
very 
much 
higher 
laws 
and 
are 
exempt 
from 
all 
that 
could 
make 
them 
lose 
the 
quality 
of 
being 
citizens 
in 
the 
society 
of 
spirits, 
God 
having 
planned 
for 
them 
so 
well, 
that 
all 
the 
changes 
in 
matter 
cannot 
make 
them 
lose 
the 
moral 
qualities 
of, 
their 
personality. 
And 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
everything 
tends 
to 
the 
perfection 
not 
only 
of 
the 
universe 
in 
general 
but 
also 
of 
those 
creatures 
in 
particular 
who 
are 
destined 
to 
such 
a 
measure 
of 
happiness 
that 
the 
universe 
finds 
itself 
interested 
therein, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
divine 
goodness 
which 
communicates 
itself 
to 
each 
one, 
according 
as 
sovereign 
wisdom 
permits 
b. 
As 
regards 
the 
ordinary 
body 
of 

animals 
and 
of 
other 
corporeal 
substances, 
the 
complete 
extinction 
of 
which 
has 
up 
to 
this 
time 
been 
believed 
in, 
and 
the 
changes 
of 
which 
depend 
rather 
upon 
mechanical 
rules 
than 
upon 
moral 
laws, 
I 
remarked 
with 
pleasure 
that 
the 
author 
of 
the 
book 
On 
Diet, 
which 
is 
attributed 
to 
Hippocrates, 
had 
foreseen 
something 
of 
the 
truth 
when 
he 
sail 
in 
express 
terms 
that 
animals 
are 
not 
born 
and 
do 
not 
die, 
and 
that 
the 
things 
which 
are 
supposed 
to 
begin 
and 
to 
perish 
only 
appear 
and 
disappear. 
This 
was 
also 
the 
opinion 
of 
Parmenides 
and 
of 
Melissus, 
according 
to 
Aristotle, 
for 
these 
ancients 
were 
more 
profoundthanisthought. 


10. 
I 
am 
the 
best 
disposed 
in 
the 
world 
to 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
moderns; 
nevertheless 
I 
think 
they 
have 
carried 
reform 
too 
far, 
for 
instance, 
in 
confounding 
natural 
things 
with 
artificial, 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
they 
have 
not 
had 
sufficiently 
high 
ideas 
of 
the 
majesty 
of 
nature. 
They 
conceive 
that 
the 
difference 
between 
its 
machines 
and 
ours 
is 
only 
that 
of 
large 
to 
small. 
This 
caused 
a 
very 
able 
man, 
author 
of 
Conversations 
on 
the 
Plurality 
of 
Worlds, 
to 
say 
recently 
that 
in 
regarding 
nature 
close 
at 
hand 
it 
is 
found 
less 
admirable 
than 
had 
been 
believed, 
being 
only 
like 
the 
workshop 
of 
an 
artisan. 
I 
believe 
that 
this 
does 
not 
give 
a 
worthy 
idea 
of 
it 
and 
that 
only 
our 
system 
can 
finally 
make 
men 
realize 
the 
true 
and 
immense 
distance 
which 
there 
is 
between 
the 
most 
trifling 
productions 
and 
mechanisms 
of 
the 
divine 
wisdom 
and 
the 
greatest 
masterpieces 
of 
the 
art 
of 
a 
finite 
mind, 
this 
difference 
consisting 
not 
merely 
in 
degree 
but 
also 
in 
kind. 
It 
must 
then 
be 
known 
that 
the 
machines 
of 
nature 
have 
a 
truly 
infinite 
number 
of 
organs 
and 
that 
they 
are 
so 
well 
protected 
and 
so 
proof 
against 
all 
accidents 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
destroy 
them. 
A 
natural 
machine 
remains 
a 
machine 
even 
to 
its 
least 
parts 
and, 
what 
is 
more, 
it 
remains 
always 
the 
same 
machine 
it 
has 
been, 
being 
only 
transformed 
by 
the 
different 
folds 
it 
receives, 
and 
sometimes 
expanded, 
sometimes 
compressedand,asitwere,concentrated 
whenbelievedtobe 
lost. 

11. 
Farther, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
soul 
or 
of 
form 
there 
arises 
a 
true 
unity 
which 
answers 
to 
what 
we 
call 
the 
I 
in 
us, 
that 
which 
could 
take 
place 
neither 
in 
the 
machines 
of 
art 
nor 
in 
the 
simple 
mass 
of 
matter 
however 
well 
organized 
it 
might 
be, 
which 
can 
only 
he 
considered 
as 
an 
army, 
or 
as 
a 
herd 
of 
cattle, 
or 
as 
a 
pond 
full 
of 
fish, 
or 
as 
a 
watch 
composed 
of 
springs 
and 
wheels. 
Nevertheless, 
if 
there 
were 
not 
real 
substantial 
unities 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
substantial 
or 
real 
in 
the 
mass. 
It 
was 
this 
which 
forced 
Cordemoi 
to 
abandon 
Descartes, 
and 
to 
embrace 
Democritus’ 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Atoms, 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
true 
unity. 
But 
atoms 
of 
matter 
are 
contrary 
to 
reason, 
leaving 
out 
of 
accountthe 
proof 
that 
they 
aremade 
upof 
parts, 
forthe 
invincible 
attachment 
of 
one 
part 
to 
another 
(if 
such 
a 
thing 
could 
be 
conceived 
or 
with 
reason 
supposed) 
would 
not 
at 
all 
destroy 
their 
diversity. 
Only 
atoms 
of 
substance, 
i. 
e. 
unities 
which 
are 
real 
and 
absolutely 
destitute 
of 
parts, 
are 
sources 
of 
actions 
and 
the 
absolute 
first 
principles 
of 
the 
composition 
of 
things, 
and, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
last 
elements 
of 
the 
analysis 
of 
substances. 
They 
might 
be 
called 
metaphysical 
points; 
they 
possess 
a 
certain 
vitality 
and 
a 
kind 
of 
perception, 
and 
mathematical 
points 
are 
their 
points 
of 
view 
to 
express 
the 
universe. 
But 
when 
corporeal 
substances 
are 
compressed 
all 
their 
organs 
together 
form 
a 
physical 
point 
to 
our 
sight. 
Thus 
physical 
points 
are 
only 
indivisible 
in 
appearance; 
mathematical 
points 
are 
so 
in 
reality 
but 
they 
are 
merely 
modalities; 
only 
metaphysical 
points 
or 
those 
of 
substance 
(constituted 
by 
forms 
or 
souls) 
are 
exact 
and 
real, 
and 
without 
them 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
real, 
for 
without 
trueunitiestherecouldnotbemultiplicity. 
12. 
After 
having 
established 
these 
propositions 
I 
thought 
myself 
entering 
into 
port, 
but 
when 
I 
came 
to 
meditate 
on 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body 
I 
was 
as 
if 
cast 
back 
into 
the 
open 
sea. 
For 
I 
found 
no 
way 
of 
explaining 
how 
the 
body 
can 
cause 
anything 
to 
pass 
into 
the 
soul, 
or 
vice 
versa; 
nor 
how 
one 
substance 
can 
communicate 
with 
another 
created 
substance. 
Descartes 
gave 

up 
the 
attempton 
that 
point,asfar 
ascanbe 
learnedfrom 
hiswritings, 
but 
his 
disciples 
seeing 
that 
the 
common 
view 
was 
inconceivable, 
were 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
we 
perceive 
the 
qualities 
of 
bodies 
because 
God 
causes 
thoughts 
to 
arise 
in 
the 
soul 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
movements 
of 
matter; 
and 
when 
the 
soul 
wished 
to 
move 
the 
body 
in 
its 
turn 
they 
judged 
that 
it 
was 
God 
who 
moved 
it 
for 
the 
soul. 
And 
as 
the 
communication 
of 
motions 
again 
seemed 
to 
them 
inconceivable, 
they 
believed 
that 
God 
gave 
motion 
to 
a 
body 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
another 
body. 
This 
is 
what 
they 
call 
the 
system 
of 
Occasional 
Causes 
which 
has 
been 
much 
in 
vogue 
on 
account 
of 
the 
beautifulremarksoftheauthor 
ofthe 
Search 
after 
Truth. 


13. 
It 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
the 
difficulty 
has 
been 
well 
penetrated 
when 
the 
not-possible 
is 
stated, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
that 
it 
is 
done 
away 
with 
by 
explaining 
what 
actually 
takes 
place. 
It 
is 
indeed 
true 
that 
there 
is 
no 
real 
influence 
of 
one 
created 
substance 
upon 
another, 
speaking 
in 
metaphysical 
strictness, 
and 
that 
all 
things 
with 
all 
their 
realities 
are 
continually 
produced 
by 
the 
power 
of 
God; 
but 
in 
resolving 
problems 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
employ 
a 
general 
cause 
and 
to 
call 
in 
what 
is 
called 
the 
Deux 
ex 
Machina. 
For 
when 
this 
is 
done 
and 
there 
is 
no 
other 
explanation 
which 
can 
he 
drawn 
from 
secondary 
causes, 
it 
is, 
properly, 
having 
recourse 
to 
miracle. 
In 
philosophy 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
try 
to 
give 
reasons 
by 
making 
known 
in 
what 
way 
things 
are 
donebydivinewisdom,in 
conformitytotheideaofthesubjectconcerned. 
14. 
Being 
then 
obliged 
to 
admit 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
the 
soul 
or 
any 
true 
substancetoreceive 
any 
influencefrom 
without, 
if 
it 
benot 
bythe 
divine 
omnipotence 
I 
wasledinsensiblytoan 
opinion 
whichsurprised 
me 
butwhich 
appears 
inevitable 
and 
which 
has 
in 
truth 
great 
advantages 
and 
many 
beauties. 
It 
is 
this: 
it 
must 
then 
be 
said 
that 
God 
created 
the 
soul, 
or 
every 
other 
real 
unity, 
in 
the 
first 
place 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
everything 
with 
it 
comes 
into 
existence 
from 
its 
own 
substance 
through 
perfect 
spontaneity 
as 
regards 

itself 
and 
in 
perfect 
harmony 
with 
objects 
outside 
itself. 
And 
that 
thus 
our 
internal 
feelings 
(i. 
e. 
those 
within 
the 
soul 
itself 
and 
not 
in 
the 
brain 
or 
finer 
parts 
of 
the 
body), 
being 
only 
phenomena 
consequent 
upon 
external 
objects 
or 
true 
appearances, 
and 
like 
well-ordered 
dreams, 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
these 
internal 
perceptions 
within 
the 
soul 
itself 
come 
to 
it 
by 
its 
own 
proper 
original 
constitution, 
i. 
e. 
by 
the 
representative 
nature 
(capable 
of 
expressing 
beings 
outside 
itself 
by 
relation 
to 
its 
organs), 
which 
has 
been 
given 
it 
at 
its 
creation 
and 
which 
constitutes 
its 
individual 
character. 
This 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
each 
of 
these 
substances 
in 
its 
own 
way 
and 
according 
to 
a 
certain 
point 
of 
view, 
represents 
exactly 
the 
entire 
universe, 
and 
perceptions 
or 
impressions 
of 
external 
things 
reach 
the 
soul 
at 
the 
proper 
point 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
own 
laws, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
in 
a 
world 
apart, 
and 
as 
if 
there 
existed 
nothing 
but 
God 
and 
itself 
(to 
make 
use 
of 
the 
manner 
of 
speaking 
of 
a 
certain 
person 
of 
great 
elevation 
of 
mind, 
whose 
piety 
is 
well 
known); 
there 
is 
also 
perfect 
harmony 
among 
all 
these 
substances, 
producing 
the 
same 
effects 
as 
if 
they 
communicated 
with 
each 
other 
by 
a 
transmission 
of 
kinds 
or 
of 
qualities, 
as 
philosophersgenerallysuppose. 


Farther, 
the 
organized 
mass, 
within 
which 
is 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
soul, 
being 
expressed 
more 
nearly 
by 
it, 
finds 
itself 
reciprocally 
ready 
to 
act 
of 
itself 
following 
the 
laws 
of 
corporeal 
machines, 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
soul 
wills 
it, 
without 
either 
one 
troubling 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
other, 
the 
nerves 
and 
the 
blood 
having 
just 
at 
that 
time 
received 
the 
impulse 
which 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
make 
them 
respond 
to 
the 
passions 
and 
perceptions 
of 
the 
soul; 
it 
is 
this 
mutual 
relationship, 
regulated 
beforehand 
in 
every 
substance 
of 
the 
universe, 
which 
produces 
what 
we 
call 
their 
intercommunication 
and 
alone 
constitutes 
the 
un 
ion 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
body. 
And 
we 
may 
understand 
from 
this 
now 
the 
soul 
has 
its 
seat 
in 
the 
body 
by 
an 
immediate 
presence 



which 
could 
not 
be 
greater, 
for 
it 
is 
there 
as 
the 
unit 
is 
in 
the 
complex 
of 
units,whichis 
the 
multitude. 


15. 
This 
hypothesis 
is 
very 
possible. 
For 
why 
could 
not 
God 
give 
to 
a 
substance 
in 
the 
beginning 
a 
nature 
or 
internal 
force 
which 
could 
produce 
in 
it 
to 
order 
(as 
in 
a 
spiritual 
or 
formal 
automaton, 
but 
free 
here 
since 
it 
has 
reason 
to 
its 
share), 
all 
that 
which 
should 
happen 
to 
it; 
that 
is 
to 
say 
all 
the 
appearances 
or 
expressions 
it 
should 
have, 
and 
that 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
any 
creature?All 
the 
more 
as 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
substance 
necessarily 
demands 
and 
essentially 
includes 
a 
progress 
or 
change, 
without 
which 
it 
would 
not 
have 
power 
to 
act. 
And 
this 
nature 
of 
the 
soul, 
being 
representative, 
in 
a 
very 
exact 
(although 
more 
or 
less 
distinct) 
manner, 
of 
the 
universe, 
the 
series 
of 
representations 
which 
the 
soul 
will 
produce 
for 
itself 
will 
naturally 
correspond 
to 
the 
series 
of 
changes 
in 
the 
universe 
itself; 
as, 
in 
turn, 
the 
body 
has 
also 
been 
accommodated 
to 
the 
soul, 
for 
the 
encounters 
where 
it 
is 
conceived 
as 
acting 
from 
without, 
This 
is 
the 
more 
reasonable 
as 
bodies 
are 
only 
made 
for 
those 
spirits 
which 
are 
capable 
of 
entering 
into 
communion 
with 
God 
and 
of 
celebrating 
His 
glory. 
Thus 
from 
the 
moment 
the 
possibility 
of 
this 
hypothesis 
of 
harmonies 
is 
perceived, 
we 
perceive 
also 
that 
it 
is’ 
the 
most 
reasonable 
and 
that 
it 
gives 
a 
marvellous 
idea 
of 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
universe 
andof 
the 
perfectionof 
theworksof 
God. 
16. 
This 
great 
advantage 
is 
also 
found 
in 
it, 
that 
instead 
of 
saying 
that 
we 
are 
FREE 
only 
in 
appearance 
and 
in 
a 
way 
practically 
sufficient, 
as 
many 
persons 
of 
ability 
have 
believed, 
it 
must 
rather 
be 
said 
that 
we 
are 
only 
enchained 
in 
appearance, 
and 
that 
according 
to 
the 
strictness 
of 
metaphysical 
expressionswearein 
astateofperfectindependenceasrespectstheinfluence 
of 
all 
other 
creatures. 
This 
again 
places 
in 
a 
marvellous 
light 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
always 
uniform 
preservation 
of 
our 
individuality 
regulated 
perfectly 
by 
its 
own 
nature 
beyond 
the 
risk 
of 
all 
accidents 
from 
without, 

whatever 
appearance 
there 
may 
be 
to 
the 
contrary. 
Never 
has 
a 
system 
so 
clearly 
proved 
our 
high 
standing. 
Every 
spirit, 
being 
like 
a 
separate 
world 
sufficient 
to 
itself, 
independent 
of 
every 
other 
creature, 
enclosing 
the 
infinite, 
expressing 
the 
universe, 
is 
as 
durable, 
as 
stable 
and 
as 
absolute 
as 
the 
universe 
of 
creatures 
itself. 
Therefore 
we 
ought 
always 
to 
appear 
in 
it 
in 
the 
way 
best 
fitted 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
society 
of 
all 
spirits, 
which 
makes 
their 
moral 
union 
in 
the 
city 
of 
God. 
Here 
is 
found 
also 
a 
new 
proof 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
surprising 
clearness. 
For 
this 
perfect 
harmony 
of 
so 
many 
substances 
which 
have 
no 
communication 
with 
eachother,canonlycomefromacommon 
cause. 


17. 
Besidesalltheseadvantageswhich 
renderthis 
systemcommendable,it 
can 
also 
be 
said 
that 
this 
is 
more 
than 
an 
hypothesis, 
since 
it 
hardly 
seems 
possible 
to 
explain 
the 
facts 
in 
any 
other 
intelligible 
manner, 
and 
since 
several 
great 
difficulties 
which 
have 
exercised 
the 
mind 
up 
to 
this 
time, 
seem 
to 
disappear 
of 
themselves 
as 
soon 
as 
this 
system 
is 
well 
understood. 
The 
customary 
ways 
of 
speaking 
can 
still 
be 
retained. 
For 
we 
can 
say 
that 
the 
substance, 
the 
disposition 
of 
which 
explains 
the 
changes 
in 
others 
in 
an 
intelligible 
manner 
(in 
this 
respect, 
that 
it 
may 
be 
supposed 
that 
the 
others 
have 
been 
in 
this 
point 
adapted 
to 
it 
since 
the 
beginning, 
according 
to 
the 
older 
of 
the 
decrees 
of 
God), 
is 
the 
one 
which 
must 
be 
conceived 
of 
as 
acting 
upon 
the 
others. 
Also 
the 
action 
of 
one 
substance 
upon 
another 
is 
not 
the 
emission 
or 
transfer 
of 
an 
entity 
as 
is 
commonly 
believed, 
and 
cannot 
be 
understood 
reasonably 
except 
in 
the 
way 
which 
I 
have 
just 
mentioned. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
can 
easily 
conceive 
in 
matter 
both 
emissions 
and 
receptions 
of 
parts, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
we 
are 
right 
in 
explaining 
mechanically 
all 
the 
phenomena 
of 
physics; 
but 
as 
the 
material 
mass 
is 
not 
a 
substance 
it 
is 
apparent 
that 
action 
as 
regards 
substance 
itself 
can 
only 
be 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said. 

18. 
These 
considerations, 
however 
metaphysical 
they 
may 
appear, 
have 
yet 
a 
marvellous 
use 
in 
physics 
in 
establishing 
the 
laws 
of 
motion, 
as 
our 
Dynamics 
can 
make 
clear. 
Tor 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
in 
the 
collision 
of 
bodies, 
each 
one 
suffers 
only 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
own 
elasticity, 
because 
of 
the 
motion 
which 
is 
already 
in 
it. 
And 
as 
to 
absolute 
motion, 
it 
can 
in 
no 
way 
be 
determined 
mathematically, 
since 
everything 
terminates 
in 
relations; 
therefore 
there 
is 
always 
a 
perfect 
equality 
of 
hypotheses, 
as 
in 
astronomy, 
so 
that 
whatever 
number 
of 
bodies 
may 
be 
taken 
it 
is 
arbitrary 
to 
assign 
repose 
of 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
velocity 
to 
any 
one 
that 
may 
be 
chosen, 
without 
being 
refuted 
by 
the 
phenomena 
of 
straight, 
circular 
and 
composite 
motion. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
attribute 
to 
bodies 
real 
movements, 
according 
to 
the 
supposition 
which 
explains 
phenomena 
in 
the 
most 
intelligible 
manner, 
since 
this 
description 
is 
in 
conformity 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
action 
which 
I 
have 
just 
established. 

THEREPLY 
OF 
M. 
FOUCHER 
TO 
LEIBNITZ 
CONCERNING 
HIS 
NEW 
SYSTEM 
OF 
THE 
INTERACTION 
OF 
SUBSTANCES. 
1695. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



ALTHOUGH 
YOUR 
SYSTEM 
is 
not 
new 
to 
me, 
sir, 
and 
althoughI 
made 
known 
to 
you, 
in 
part, 
my 
opinion 
in 
replying 
to 
a 
letter 
which 
you 
wrote 
me 
on 
this 
subject 
more 
than 
ten 
years 
ago, 
still 
I 
will 
not 
fail 
to 
tell 
you 
again 
whatIthinkofit,sinceyouaskmeanew. 


The 
first 
part 
aims 
only 
to 
make 
known 
in 
all 
substances 
the 
unities 
which 
constitute 
their 
reality 
and 
distinguish 
them 
from 
others, 
and 
form, 
to 
speak 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
the 
school, 
their 
individuation; 
this 
is 
what 
you 
remark 
first 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
matter 
or 
extension. 
I 
agree 
with 
you 
that 
it 
is 
right 
to 
inquire 
after 
the 
unities 
which 
form 
the 
composition 
and 
the 
reality 
of 
extension, 
for 
without 
this, 
as 
you 
very 
justly 
remark, 
an 
always 
divisible 
extension 
is 
only 
a 
chimerical 
compound, 
the 
principles 
of 
which 
do 
not 
exist 
since 
without 
unities 
no 
true 
multitude 
is 
possible. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
wonder 
that 
people 
are 
indifferent 
on 
this 
subject, 
for 
the 
essential 
principles 
of 
extension 
cannot 
exist 
really. 
In 
truth, 
points 
without 
parts 
cannot 
be 
in 
the 
universe, 
and 
two 
points 
joined 
together 
form 
no 
extension; 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
any 
length 
can 
subsist 
without 
breadth, 
or 
any 
surface 
without 
depth. 
And 
it 
is 
of 
no 
use 
to 
bring 
forward 
physical 
points, 
for 
these 
points 
are 
extended 
and 
involve 
all 
the 
difficulties 
which 
we 
should 
like 
to 
avoid. 
But 
I 
will 
not 
longer 
delay 
on 
this 
subject 
on 
which 
you 
and 
I 
have 
already 
had 
a 
discussion 
in 
the 
Journal 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
of 
March, 
1693, 
and 
of 
the 
third 
of 
Augustof 
the 
same 
year. 



You 
introduce 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
another 
kind 
of 
unities 
which, 
strictly 
speaking, 
are 
unities 
of 
composition 
or 
of 
relation, 
and 
which 
respect 
the 
perfection 
or 
completion 
of 
a 
whole 
which, 
being 
organic, 
is 
destined 
for 
certain 
functions; 
for 
example, 
a 
clock 
is 
one, 
an 
animal 
is 
one; 
and 
you 
believe 
that 
you 
can 
give 
the 
name 
of 
substantial 
forms 
to 
the 
natural 
unities 
of 
animals 
and 
of 
plants, 
so 
that 
these 
unities 
shall 
form 
their 
individuation 
in 
distinguishing 
them 
from 
every 
other 
compound. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
you 
are 
right 
in 
giving 
animals 
a 
principle 
of 
individuation 
other 
than 
that 
which 
is 
usually 
given 
them, 
which 
is 
only 
through 
relation 
to 
external 
accidents. 
In 
reality 
this 
principle 
must 
be 
internal, 
as 
much 
on 
the 
part 
of 
their 
soul 
as 
of 
their 
body, 
but 
whatever 
disposition 
there 
may 
be 
in 
the 
organs 
of 
the 
animal, 
that 
does 
not 
suffice 
to 
render 
it 
sensible. 
For 
finally 
all 
this 
concerns 
merely 
the 
organic 
and 
mechanical 
composition, 
and 
I 
do 
not 
see 
that 
you 
are 
thereby 
justified 
in 
constituting 
a 
sensitive 
principle 
in 
brutes 
differing 
substantially 
from 
that 
of 
men. 
And 
after 
all 
it 
is 
not 
without 
reason 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
acknowledge 
that 
if 
we 
admit 
a 
sensitive 
principle 
capable 
of 
distinguishing 
good 
from 
evil, 
it 
is 
consequently 
necessary 
also 
to 
admit 
in 
them 
reason, 
discernment 
and 
judgment. 
So, 
allow 
me 
to 
say 
to 
you, 
sir, 
that 
this 
doesnotsolvethedifficulty,either. 


We 
come 
to 
your 
concomitance 
which 
forms 
the 
principal 
and 
second 
part 
of 
your 
system. 
We 
will 
admit 
that 
God, 
that 
greatartisan 
of 
theuniverse, 
can 
adjust 
all 
the 
organic 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
of 
a 
man 
so 
well 
that 
they 
shall 
be 
capable 
of 
producing 
all 
the 
movements 
which 
the 
soul 
joined 
to 
this 
body 
mightwish 
to 
produce 
in 
the 
course 
of 
itslife, 
without 
its 
havingthe 
power 
to 
change 
these 
movements 
or 
to 
modify 
them 
in 
any 
way. 
And, 
reciprocally, 
God 
can 
produce 
a 
contrivance 
in 
the 
soul 
(be 
it 
a 
machine 
of 
a 
new 
kind 
or 
not), 
by 
means 
of 
which 
all 
the 
thoughts 
and 
modifications 
which 
correspond 
to 
these 
movements 
shall 
arise 
successively 
at 
the 
same 
moment 
that 
the 



body 
shall 
perform 
its 
functions. 
And 
I 
admit 
that 
this 
is 
not 
more 
impossible 
than 
to 
make 
two 
clocks 
agree 
so 
well 
and 
go 
so 
uniformly 
that 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
clock 
A 
shall 
strike 
twelve 
clock 
B 
also 
strikes, 
so 
that 
one 
would 
imagine 
that 
the 
two 
clocks 
are 
regulated 
by 
the 
same 
weight 
or 
the 
same 
spring. 
But 
after 
all, 
to 
what 
can 
this 
great 
artifice 
in 
substances 
serve 
if 
not 
to 
make 
men 
believe 
that 
the 
one 
acts 
upon 
the 
other, 
although 
this 
is 
not 
true? 
In 
reality, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
this 
system 
is 
hardly 
more 
advantageous 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Cartesians; 
and 
if 
we 
are 
right 
in 
rejecting 
theirs 
because 
it 
uselessly 
supposes 
that 
God, 
considering 
the 
movements 
which 
he 
himself 
produces 
in 
the 
body, 
produces 
also 
in 
the 
soul 
thoughts 
which 
correspond 
to 
these 
movements, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
not 
more 
worthy 
of 
him 
to 
produce 
all 
at 
once 
the 
thoughts 
and 
modifications 
of 
the 
soul 
without 
needing 
bodies 
to 
serve 
as 
regulators 
and 
so 
to 
speak, 
inform 
him 
what 
he 
ought 
to 
do 
— 
shall 
we 
not 
have 
reason 
to 
inquire 
of 
you 
why 
God 
does 
not 
content 
himself 
with 
producing 
all 
the 
thoughts 
and 
modifications 
of 
the 
soul 
(whether 
he 
do 
it 
immediately 
or 
by 
contrivance, 
as 
you 
will), 
without 
there 
being 
useless 
bodies 
which 
the 
mind 
can 
neither 
move 
nor 
know? 
Even 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
although 
no 
movement 
should 
take 
place 
in 
the 
body, 
the 
soul 
would 
not 
cease 
to 
think 
always 
that 
there 
was 
one; 
just 
as 
those 
who 
are 
asleep 
think 
that 
they 
are 
moving 
their 
members 
and 
are 
walking, 
when 
nevertheless 
those 
members 
are 
at 
rest 
and 
do 
not 
move 
at 
all. 
Thus, 
during 
the 
waking 
state, 
souls 
would 
remain 
always 
persuaded 
that 
their 
bodies 
would 
move 
according 
to 
their 
desires, 
although, 
nevertheless, 
these 
vain 
and 
useless 
masses 
would 
be 
inactive 
and 
would 
remain 
in 
a 
continuous 
lethargy. 
Truly, 
sir, 
do 
we 
not 
see 
that 
these 
opinions 
are 
made 
expressly 
and 
that 
these 
ex 
post 
facto 
systems 
have 
been 
invented 
only 
to 
save 
certain 
principles 
which 
have 
been 
adopted? 
In 
fact, 
the 
Cartesians, 
supposing 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
common 
between 
spiritual 
and 
corporeal 
substances, 
cannot 
explain 
how 
one 



acts 
on 
the 
other; 
and 
consequently 
they 
are 
compelled 
to 
say 
what 
they 
do. 
But 
you, 
sir, 
who 
could 
free 
yourself 
by 
other 
ways, 
I 
am 
surprised 
that 
you 
embarrass 
yourself 
with 
their 
difficulties. 
For 
who 
does 
not 
see 
that 
when 
a 
balance 
is 
in 
equilibrium 
and 
inactive, 
if 
a 
new 
weight 
is 
added 
to 
one 
of 
the 
sides, 
forthwith 
movement 
appears 
and 
one 
of 
the 
counterweights 
makes 
the 
other 
rise 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
effort 
which 
the 
latter 
makes 
to 
descend. 
You 
conceive 
that 
material 
beings 
are 
capable 
of 
efforts 
and 
of 
movement; 
and 
it 
follows 
very 
naturally 
that 
the 
strongest 
effort 
must 
surpass 
the 
weakest. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
you 
recognize 
also 
that 
spiritual 
beings 
may 
make 
efforts; 
and 
as 
there 
is 
no 
effort 
which 
does 
not 
suppose 
some 
resistance, 
it 
is 
necessary 
either 
that 
this 
resistance 
be 
stronger 
or 
weaker; 
if 
stronger, 
it 
overcomes; 
if 
weaker, 
it 
yields. 
Now 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
the 
mind 
making 
an 
effort 
to 
move 
the 
body 
finds 
it 
endowed 
with 
a 
contrary 
effort 
which 
resists 
— 
sometimes 
more, 
sometimes 
less, 
and 
this 
suffices 
to 
cause 
it 
to 
suffer 
thereby. 
It 
is 
thus 
St. 
Augustine, 
in 
his 
books 
on 
music, 
explains 
of 
set 
purposetheaetionof 
spiritson 
bodies. 


I 
know 
that 
there 
are 
many 
other 
questions 
to 
be 
raised 
before 
resolving 
from 
first 
principles 
all 
those 
which 
might 
be 
agitated; 
so 
true 
is 
it 
that 
one 
ought 
to 
observe 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
academicians, 
the 
second 
of 
which 
forbids 
the 
calling 
in 
question 
those 
things 
which 
one 
easily 
sees 
cannot 
be 
decided, 
such 
as 
are 
almost 
all 
those 
of 
which 
we 
have 
just 
spoken; 
not 
that 
these 
questions 
are 
absolutely 
insoluble 
but 
because 
they 
can 
only 
be 
solved 
in 
a 
certain 
order, 
which 
requires 
that 
philosophers 
begin 
by 
agreeing 
as 
to 
the 
infallible 
mark 
of 
truth, 
and 
confine 
themselves 
to 
demonstrating 
from 
first 
principles; 
and 
by 
waiting, 
one 
can 
always 
separate 
that 
which 
is 
conceived 
clearly 
and 
sufficiently 
from 
other 
points 
or 
subjects 
which 
embrace 
some 
obscurity. 



This, 
sir, 
is 
what 
I 
can 
say 
at 
present 
of 
your 
system, 
without 
speaking 
of 
the 
other 
fine 
subjects 
of 
which 
you 
there 
incidentally 
treat, 
and 
which 
would 
meritparticular 
discussion. 



EXPLANATIONOF 
THE 
NEWSYSTEM 
CONCERNING 
THE 
COMMUNICATION 
BETWEEN 
SUBSTANCES, 
TO 
SERVE 
AS 
A 
REPLY 
TO 
THE 
MEMOIROF 
M. 
FOUCHER 
INSERTED 
IN 
THE 
“JOURNAL 
DESSAVANS” 
OF 
SEPTEMBER 
12,1695. 
1696. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



I 
REMEMBER, 
SIR, 
that 
I 
believed 
I 
was 
fulfilling 
your 
wishes 
in 
communicating 
to 
you, 
many 
years 
ago, 
my 
philosophical 
hypothesis, 
although 
I 
assured 
you 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
I 
had 
not 
yet 
made 
up 
my 
mind 
to 
avow 
it. 
I 
asked 
for 
your 
opinion 
of 
it 
in 
exchange, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
remember 
to 
have 
received 
any 
objections 
from 
you; 
otherwise, 
teachable 
as 
I 
am, 
I 
should 
not 
have 
given 
you 
occasion 
to 
make 
the 
same 
objections 
to 
me 
twice. 
However, 
after 
the 
publication, 
they 
still 
come 
apropos. 
For 
I 
am 
not 
one 
of 
those 
in 
whom 
a 
prepossession 
takes 
the 
place 
of 
reason, 
as 
you 
will 
experience 
when 
you 
are 
able 
to 
bring 
forward 
some 
precise 
and 
weighty 
arguments 
against 
my 
opinions, 
a 
thing 
which 
apparently 
has 
not 
been 
your 
design 
on 
this 
occasion. 
You 
have 
wished 
to 
speak 
as 
a 
skillful 
academician 
and 
thusgive 
opportunityfora 
thoroughexaminationofthesesubjects. 


I 
have 
not 
wished 
to 
explain 
here 
the 
principles 
of 
extension, 
but 
those 
of 
effective 
extension 
or 
of 
corporeal 
mass; 
and 
these 
principles, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
are 
real 
unities; 
that 
is, 
substances 
endowed 
with 
true 
unity. 
The 
unity 
of 
a 
clock, 
of 
which 
you 
make 
mention, 
is 
entirely 
different, 
with 
me, 
from 
that 
of 
an 
animal, 
which 
latter 
is 
capable 
of 
being 
a 
substance 
endowed 
with 
a 
true 
unity, 
like 
what 
we 
call 
the 
ego 
in 
us; 
whereas 
a 
clock 
is 
nothing 
but 
an 
assemblage. 
It 
is 
not 
in 
the 
disposition 
of 
the 
organs 
that 
I 
place 
the 
sensitive 



principle 
of 
animals, 
and 
I 
admit 
that 
it 
concerns 
only 
the 
corporeal 
mass. 
So 
it 
seems 
that 
you 
do 
not 
make 
me 
out 
to 
be 
wrong 
when 
I 
demand 
true 
unities 
and 
when 
for 
this 
reason 
I 
rehabilitate 
substantial 
forms. 
But 
when 
you 
seem 
to 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
brutes 
must 
possess 
reason 
if 
feeling 
is 
ascribed 
to 
it 
you 
make 
useofa 
conclusion,theforceof 
whichIdonotsee. 


You 
admit, 
with 
praiseworthy 
sincerity, 
that 
my 
hypothesis 
of 
harmony 
or 
of 
concomitance 
is 
possible. 
But 
you 
do 
not 
conceal 
a 
certain 
repugnance 
to 
it; 
undoubtedly 
because 
you 
have 
believed 
it 
purely 
arbitrary, 
not 
having 
been 
informed 
that 
it 
follows 
from 
my 
view 
of 
unities, 
for 
therein 
everything 
is 
connected. 
You 
demand 
then, 
sir, 
what 
purpose 
all 
this 
contrivance 
which 
I 
attribute 
to 
the 
author 
of 
nature 
may 
serve? 
As 
if 
one 
could 
attribute 
too 
much 
of 
it 
to 
him, 
and 
as 
if 
this 
exact 
correspondence 
which 
substances 
have 
among 
themselves 
by 
laws 
of 
their 
own 
which 
each 
one 
has 
received 
in 
the 
beginning, 
was 
not 
a 
thing 
admirably 
beautiful 
in 
itself 
and 
worthy 
of 
its 
author. 
You 
ask, 
too, 
what 
advantage 
I 
find 
herein. 
I 
might 
refer 
to 
what 
I 
have 
already 
said 
of 
it; 
nevertheless, 
I 
reply, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
when 
a 
thing 
cannot 
but 
be 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
admit 
it, 
we 
should 
demand 
of 
what 
use 
it 
is. 
Of 
what 
use 
is 
the 
incommensurability 
of 
the 
side 
with 
the 
diagonal? 
I 
reply, 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
that 
this 
correspondence 
serves 
to 
explain 
the 
communication 
of 
substances 
and 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body 
by 
laws 
of 
nature 
established 
beforehand, 
without 
having 
recourse 
either 
to 
a 
transmission 
of 
species, 
which 
is 
inconceivable, 
or 
to 
fresh 
assistance 
from 
God, 
which 
appears 
very 
unsuitable. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
understood 
that 
as 
there 
are 
laws 
of 
nature 
in 
matter, 
so 
there 
are 
like 
laws 
in 
soulsor 
forms, 
andtheselawseffectwhatIhavejuststated. 


I 
shall 
be 
asked, 
farther, 
whence 
it 
comes 
that 
God 
does 
not 
content 
himself 
with 
producing 
all 
the 
thoughts 
and 
modifications 
of 
the 
soul 
without 
these 
useless 
bodies 
which 
the 
soul, 
they 
say, 
can 
neither 
move 
nor 
know? 



The 
reply 
is 
easy. 
It 
is 
that 
God 
has 
willed 
that 
there 
should 
be 
more 
rather 
than 
fewer 
substances, 
and 
that 
he 
has 
thought 
it 
good 
that 
these 
modifications 
of 
the 
soul 
should 
answer 
to 
something 
external. 
There 
is 
no 
useless 
substance; 
they 
all 
cooperate 
in 
the 
design 
of 
God. 
I 
am 
unwilling, 
also, 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
know 
the 
body 
at 
all, 
although 
this 
knowledge 
is 
gained 
without 
the 
influence 
of 
one 
upon 
the 
other. 
I 
should 
even 
have 
no 
difficulty 
in 
saying 
that 
the 
soul 
moves 
the 
body; 
and 
as 
a 
Copernican 
speaks 
truly 
of 
the 
rising 
of 
the 
sun, 
a 
Platonist 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
matter, 
a 
Cartesian 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
sensible 
qualities, 
provided 
that 
he 
is 
rightly 
understood, 
so 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
quite 
true 
to 
say 
that 
substances 
act, 
the 
one 
on 
the 
other, 
provided 
that 
it 
be 
understood 
that 
one 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
other 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
harmony. 
As 
to 
the 
objection 
concerning 
the 
lethargy 
of 
bodies, 
that 
they 
would 
be 
inactive 
while 
the 
soul 
would 
think 
them 
in 
movement, 
this 
could 
not 
be, 
because 
of 
this 
same 
unfailing 
correspondence 
which 
the 
divine 
wisdom 
has 
established. 
I 
know 
no 
vain, 
useless 
and 
inactive 
masses 
of 
which 
you 
speak. 
There 
is 
action 
everywhere, 
and 
I 
establish 
that 
fact 
better 
than 
the 
received 
philosophy 
does, 
because 
I 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
no 
body 
without 
movement, 
norsubstancewithouteffort. 


I 
do 
not 
understand 
in 
what 
the 
objection 
consists 
contained 
in 
the 
words, 
“In 
truth, 
sir, 
do 
not 
we 
see 
that 
these 
opinions 
are 
made 
expressly, 
and 
that 
these 
ex 
post 
facto 
systems 
have 
been 
invented 
only 
in 
order 
to 
save 
certain 
principles?” 
All 
the 
hypotheses 
are 
made 
expressly, 
and 
all 
the 
systems 
follow 
after, 
to 
save 
phenomena 
or 
appearances; 
but 
I 
do 
not 
see 
what 
the 
principles 
are 
of 
which 
I 
am 
said 
to 
be 
prepossessed, 
and 
which 
I 
wish 
to 
save. 
If 
this 
means 
that 
I 
am 
led 
to 
my 
hypothesis 
by 
a 
priori 
reasons 
or 
by 
certain 
principles, 
as 
is 
in 
truth 
the 
fact, 
it 
is 
rather 
praise 
for 
the 
hypothesis 
than 
an 
objection. 
It 
is 
usually 
sufficient 
that 
a 
hypothesis 
prove 
itself 
a 



posteriori, 
because 
it 
satisfies 
the 
phenomena; 
but 
when 
there 
are 
also 
reasons 
elsewhere 
and 
a 
priori, 
it 
is 
so 
much 
the 
better. 
But 
perhaps 
this 
means 
that 
having 
invented 
a 
new 
opinion 
I 
have 
been 
very 
glad 
to 
employ 
it, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
myself 
the 
airs 
of 
an 
innovator, 
rather 
than 
because 
I 
recognized 
any 
usefulness 
in 
it. 
I 
do 
not 
know, 
sir, 
whether 
you 
have 
a 
poor 
enough 
opinion 
of 
me 
to 
attribute 
these 
thoughts 
to 
me. 
For 
you 
know 
that 
I 
love 
the 
truth 
and 
that 
if 
I 
affected 
novelties 
so 
much 
I 
should 
be 
in 
more 
haste 
to 
produce 
them, 
especially 
those 
the 
solidity 
of 
which 
is 
recognized. 
But 
in 
order 
that 
those 
who 
do 
not 
know 
me 
so 
well 
may 
not 
give 
your 
words 
a 
meaning 
we 
would 
not 
like, 
it 
will 
be 
sufficient 
to 
say 
that 
in 
my 
opinion 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
explain 
otherwise 
continual 
action 
conformable 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
nature, 
and 
that 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
usefulness 
of 
my 
hypothesis 
will 
be 
recognized 
by 
the 
difficulty 
which 
the 
most 
sharp-sighted 
philosophers 
of 
our 
time 
have 
found 
in 
the 
communication 
between 
minds 
and 
bodies, 
and 
even 
of 
corporealsubstancesamongthemselves; 
and 
Ido 
not 
know 
if 
youhave 
not 
found 
some 
there 
yourself. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
there 
are, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
efforts 
in 
all 
substances, 
but 
these 
efforts 
are 
properly 
only 
in 
the 
substance 
itself; 
and 
what 
follows 
in 
the 
others 
is 
only 
in 
virtue 
of 
a 
pre-established 
harmony 
(if 
I 
may 
be 
permitted 
to 
use 
this 
word), 
and 
in 
no 
wise 
by 
a 
real 
influence 
or 
by 
a 
transmission 
of 
some 
property 
or 
quality. 
As 
I 
have 
explained 
what 
action 
and 
passionare,you 
mayinferalso 
the 
meaningofeffortandresistance. 


You 
say 
you 
know, 
sir, 
that 
there 
are 
many 
other 
questions 
to 
be 
asked 
before 
those 
which 
we 
have 
just 
agitated 
can 
be 
decided. 
But 
perhaps 
you 
will 
find 
that 
I 
have 
already 
asked 
them, 
and 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
your 
academicians 
have 
employed 
with 
greater 
rigor 
or 
with 
more 
effect 
than 
I 
what 
there 
is 
of 
good 
in 
their 
method. 
I 
highly 
approve 
of 
seeking 
to 
demonstrate 
truths 
from 
first 
principles; 
it 
is 
more 
useful 
than 
is 
thought, 
and 
I 
have 
put 
this 
precept 
into 
practice. 
So 
I 
approve 
of 
what 
you 
say 
on 
that 



head, 
and 
I 
would 
that 
your 
example 
would 
bring 
our 
philosophers 
to 
think 
of 
it 
as 
they 
should. 
I 
will 
add 
another 
reflection 
which 
seems 
to 
me 
important 
in 
making 
the 
reality 
and 
usefulness 
of 
my 
system 
better 
understood. 
You 
know 
that 
Descartes 
believed 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
motion 
is 
preserved 
in 
bodies. 
Ithasbeen 
shown 
that 
he 
was 
mistakenon 
that 
point, 
but 
Ihave 
made 
it 
apparent 
that 
it 
is 
always 
true 
that 
the 
same 
moving 
force, 
for 
which 
he 
had 
substituted 
the 
quantity 
of 
movement, 
is 
preserved. 
However, 
the 
changes 
which 
take 
place 
in 
bodies 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
modifications 
of 
the 
soul 
embarrassed 
him, 
because 
they 
seemed 
to 
violate 
this 
law. 
He 
believed 
that 
he 
had 
found 
an 
expedient, 
which 
in 
truth 
is 
ingenious, 
by 
saying 
that 
we 
must 
distinguish 
between 
movement 
and 
direction, 
and 
that 
the 
soul 
cannot 
increase 
or 
diminish 
the 
moving 
force, 
but 
that 
it 
changes 
the 
direction 
or 
determination 
of 
the 
course 
of 
the 
animal 
spirits, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
in 
this 
way 
that 
voluntary 
movements 
take 
place. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
he 
was 
unwilling 
to 
explain 
how 
the 
soul 
acts 
to 
change 
the 
course 
of 
bodies, 
that 
which 
is 
as 
inconceivable 
as 
to 
say 
that 
it 
gives 
them 
movement, 
unless 
recourse 
is 
had 
with 
me 
to 
the 
pre-established 
harmony. 
But 
it 
should 
be 
known 
that 
there 
is 
another 
law 
of 
nature, 
which 
I 
have 
discovered 
and 
demonstrated, 
and 
which 
Descartes 
did 
not 
know. 
It 
is 
that 
not 
only 
is 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
moving 
force 
preserved, 
but 
also 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
direction 
towards 
whatever 
side 
in 
the 
world 
is 
taken. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
drawing 
any 
straight 
line 
you 
please 
and 
taking 
also 
such 
and 
as 
many 
bodies 
as 
you 
please, 
you 
will 
find, 
in 
considering 
all 
these 
bodies 
together, 
without 
omitting 
any 
of 
those 
which 
act 
upon 
any 
one 
of 
those 
you 
have 
taken, 
that 
there 
will 
always 
be 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
progress 
on 
the 
same 
side 
in 
all 
the 
parallels 
to 
the 
right 
line 
which 
you 
have 
taken, 
taking 
care 
to 
estimate 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
progress 
in 
omitting 
that 
of 
the 
bodies 
which 
move 
in 
the 
direction 
opposite 
to 
that 
of 
the 
bodies 
which 
move 
in 
the 
direction 
taken. 
This 
law, 
being 
just 
as 
beautiful 



and 
just 
as 
general 
as 
the 
other, 
no 
more 
deserves 
to 
be 
violated 
than 
the 
other; 
and 
this 
is 
avoided 
by 
my 
system, 
which 
preserves 
the 
force 
and 
the 
direction, 
and 
in 
a 
word 
all 
the 
natural 
laws 
of 
bodies, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
changes 
which

SECOND 
EXPLANATION 
OF 
THE 
SYSTEM 
OF 
THE 
COMMUNICATIONBETWEEN 
SUBSTANCES. 
1696. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



BY 
YOUR 
REFLECTIONS, 
sir, 
I 
see 
clearly 
that 
the 
thought 
which 
one 
of 
my 
friendshaspublishedin 
the 
Journal 
de 
Paris 
has 
needofexplanation. 


You 
do 
not 
understand, 
you 
say, 
how 
I 
could 
prove 
that 
which 
I 
advanced 
concerning 
the 
communication 
or 
harmony 
of 
two 
substances 
so 
different 
as 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
I 
believe 
that 
I 
have 
found 
the 
means 
of 
doing 
so, 
and 
this 
is 
how 
I 
propose 
to 
satisfy 
you. 
Imagine 
two 
clocks 
or 
watches 
which 
agree 
perfectly. 
Now, 
this 
may 
take 
place 
in 
three 
ways. 
The 
first 
consists 
in 
a 
mutual 
influence; 
the 
second 
is 
to 
have 
a 
skillful 
workman 
attached 
to 
them 
who 
regulates 
them 
and 
keeps 
them 
always 
in 
accord; 
the 
third 
is 
to 
construct 
these 
two 
clocks 
with 
so 
much 
art 
and 
accuracy 
as 
to 
assure 
their 
future 
harmony. 
Put 
now 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body 
in 
place 
of 
these 
two 
clocks; 
their 
accordance 
may 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
one 
of 
these 
three 
ways. 
The 
way 
of 
influence 
is 
that 
of 
common 
philosophy, 
but 
as 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
of 
material 
particles 
which 
may 
pass 
from 
one 
of 
these 
substances 
into 
the 
other, 
this 
view 
must 
be 
abandoned. 
The 
way 
of 
the 
continual 
assistance 
of 
the 
creator 
is 
that 
of 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes; 
but 
I 
hold 
that 
this 
is 
to 
make 
a 
Deus 
ex 
Machina 
intervene 
in 
a 
natural 
and 
ordinary 
matter, 
in 
which, 
according 
to 
reason, 
he 
ought 
not 
to 
cooperate 
except 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
he 
does 
in 
all 
other 
natural 
things. 
Thus 
there 
remains 
only 
my 
hypothesis; 
that 
is, 
the 
way 
of 
harmony. 
From 
the 
beginning 
God 
has 
made 
each 
of 
these 
two 
substances 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
merely 
by 
following 
its 
own 
peculiar 
laws, 
received 
with 
its 
being, 
it 
nevertheless 
accords 
with 
the 



other, 
just 
as 
if 
there 
were 
a 
mutual 
influence 
or 
as 
if 
God 
always 
put 
his 
hand 
thereto 
in 
addition 
to 
his 
general 
cooperation. 
After 
this 
I 
have 
no 
need 
of 
proving 
anything, 
unless 
you 
wish 
to 
require 
me 
to 
prove 
that 
God 
is 
sufficiently 
skillful 
to 
make 
use 
of 
this 
prevenient 
contrivance, 
examples 
of 
which 
we 
see 
even 
among 
men. 
Now, 
taking 
for 
granted 
that 
he 
can 
do 
it, 
you 
easily 
see 
that 
this 
is 
the 
way 
most 
beautiful 
and 
most 
worthy 
of 
him. 
You 
suspected 
that 
my 
explanation 
would 
be 
opposed 
to 
the 
very 
different 
idea 
which 
we 
have 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
of 
the 
body; 
but 
you 
will 
presently 
clearly 
see 
that 
no 
one 
has 
better 
established 
their 
independence. 
For 
while 
it 
has 
been 
necessary 
to 
explain 
their 
communication 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
miracle, 
occasion 
has 
always 
been 
given 
to 
many 
people 
to 
fear 
that 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
body 
and 
the 
soul 
was 
not 
as 
real 
as 
was 
believed, 
since 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
it 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
go 
so 
far. 
I 
shall 
not 
be 
at 
all 
sorry 
to 
sound 
enlightened 
persons 
concerning 
the 
thoughts 
which 
I 
have 
just 
explained 
to 
you. 



THIRD 
EXPLANATION. 
EXTRACT 
FROM 
A 
LETTER 
OF 
LEIBNITZ 
ON 
HIS 
PHILOSOPHICAL 
HYPOTHESIS 
AND 
THE 
CURIOUS 
PROBLEM 
PROPOSED 
BY 
HIS 
FRIENDS 
TO 
THE 
MATHEMATICIANS. 
1696. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



SO 
M 
E 
WISE 
AND 
penetrating 
friends, 
having 
considered 
my 
novel 
hypothesis 
concerning 
the 
great 
question 
of 
the 
union 
of 
soul 
and 
body, 
and 
having 
found 
itofimportance 
have 
besought 
me 
to 
give 
some 
explanations 
of 
the 
difficulties 
which 
have 
been 
raised 
and 
which 
come 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
hasnotbeenwellunderstood. 


I 
have 
thought 
that 
the 
matter 
might 
be 
rendered 
intelligible 
to 
every 
sort 
ofmindby 
the 
following 
comparison: 


Imagine 
two 
clocks 
or 
two 
watches 
which 
agree 
perfectly. 
Now 
this 
may 
happen 
in 
three 
ways. 
The 
first 
consists 
in 
the 
mutual 
influence 
of 
one 
clock 
on 
the 
other; 
the 
second, 
in 
the 
care 
of 
a 
man 
who 
attends 
thereto; 
the 
third, 
intheir 
ownaccuracy. 


The 
first 
way, 
which 
is 
that 
of 
influence, 
has 
been 
experimented 
on 
by 
the 
late 
M. 
Huygens, 
to 
his 
great 
astonishment. 
He 
had 
two 
large 
pendulums 
attached 
to 
the 
same 
piece 
of 
wood; 
the 
continual 
vibrations 
of 
these 
pendulums 
communicated 
similar 
vibrations 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
wood; 
but 
these 
different 
vibrations 
not 
being 
able 
to 
subsist 
very 
well 
in 
their 
order 
and 
without 
hindering 
each 
other, 
unless 
the 
pendulums 
agreed, 
it 
happened 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
marvel 
that 
even 
when 
their 
beats 
had 
been 
purposely 
disturbed 
they 
sooncameagaintobeattogether, 
almostlike 
twochords 
whicharein 
unison. 



The 
second 
way 
of 
making 
two 
clocks, 
even 
although 
poor, 
always 
accord, 
would 
be 
to 
have 
a 
skillful 
workman 
who 
should 
see 
to 
it 
that 
they 
arekeptin 
constantagreement. 
ThisiswhatIcallthewayofassistance. 


Finally, 
the 
third 
way 
would 
be 
to 
make 
in 
the 
first 
place 
these 
two 
clocks 
with 
so 
much 
art 
and 
accuracy 
that 
we 
might 
be 
assured 
of 
their 
future 
accordance. 
This 
istheway 
ofthepre-establishedagreement. 


Put 
now 
the 
sold 
and 
the 
body 
in 
the 
place 
of 
these 
two 
clocks. 
Their 
harmony 
or 
sympathy 
will 
take 
place 
by 
one 
of 
these 
three 
methods. 
The 
way 
of 
influence 
is 
that 
of 
common 
philosophy; 
but 
as 
we 
cannot 
conceive 
of 
material 
particles 
or 
properties, 
or 
immaterial 
qualities, 
which 
can 
pass 
from 
one 
of 
these 
substances 
into 
the 
other, 
we 
are 
obliged 
to 
abandon 
this 
view. 
The 
way 
of 
assistance 
is 
that 
of 
the 
system 
of 
occasional 
causes; 
but 
I 
hold 
that 
this 
is 
making 
a 
Deus 
ex 
Machina 
intervene 
in 
a 
natural 
and 
ordinary 
matter, 
when, 
according 
to 
reason, 
he 
ought 
not 
to 
intervene 
except 
in 
the 
mannerinwhichhecooperates 
inalltheotheraffairsofnature. 


Thus,thereremainsonly 
myhypothesis;thatis,theway 
ofa 
harmonypreestablished 
by 
a 
prevenient 
divine 
contrivance, 
which 
from 
the 
beginning 
has 
formed 
each 
of 
these 
substances 
in 
a 
way 
so 
perfect 
and 
regulated 
with 
so 
much 
accuracy 
that 
merely 
by 
following 
laws 
of 
its 
own, 
received 
with 
its 
being, 
it 
nevertheless 
agrees 
with 
the 
other, 
just 
as 
if 
there 
were 
mutual 
influence, 
or 
as 
if 
God 
in 
addition 
to 
his 
general 
cooperation 
constantly 
put 
hishandthereto. 


After 
this 
I 
do 
not 
think 
I 
need 
to 
prove 
anything, 
unless 
it 
be 
that 
you 
wish 
me 
to 
prove 
that 
God 
has 
everything 
necessary 
to 
making 
use 
of 
this 
prevenient 
contrivance, 
examples 
of 
which 
we 
see 
even 
among 
men, 
according 
to 
their 
skill. 
And 
supposing 
that 
he 
can 
do 
it 
you 
see 
well 
that 
this 
is

admirablewayand 
theonemostworthy

It 
is 
true 
that 
I 
have 
yet 
other 
proofs 
but 
they 
are 
more 
profound, 
and 
it

REFLECTIONS 
ON 
LOCKE’S 
ESSAY 
ON 
HUMAN 
UNDERSTANDING. 
1696. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



I 
FIND 
SO 
many 
marks 
of 
unusual 
penetration 
in 
what 
Mr. 
Locke 
has 
given 
us 
on 
the 
Human 
Understanding 
and 
on 
Education, 
and 
I 
consider 
the 
matter 
so 
important, 
that 
I 
have 
thought 
that 
the 
time 
would 
not 
be 
badly 
employed 
which 
I 
should 
give 
to 
such 
profitable 
reading; 
all 
the 
more 
as 
I 
have 
myself 
deeply 
meditated 
concerning 
that 
which 
has 
to 
do 
with 
the 
foundations 
of 
our 
knowledge. 
It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
I 
have 
jotted 
down 
on 
this 
sheet 
some 
of 
the 
reflections 
which 
have 
occurred 
to 
me 
in 
reading 
his 
Essay 
on 
the 
Understanding. 
Of 
all 
researches, 
there 
is 
none 
more 
important, 
becauseitisthekeytoallothers. 


The 
first 
book 
considers 
mainly 
the 
principles 
said 
to 
be 
born 
with 
us. 
Mr. 
Locke 
does 
not 
admit 
them 
any 
more 
than 
he 
does 
innate 
ideas. 
He 
has 
undoubtedly 
had 
good 
reasons 
for 
putting 
himself 
in 
opposition 
on 
this 
point 
to 
ordinary 
prejudices, 
for 
the 
name 
of 
ideas 
and 
principles 
is 
extremely 
abused. 
Common 
philosophers 
makethemselves 
principles 
at 
their 
fancy; 
and 
the 
Cartesians, 
who 
profess 
more 
accuracy, 
do 
not 
fail 
to 
intrench 
themselves 
behind 
so-called 
ideas 
of 
extension, 
of 
matter 
and 
of 
the 
soul, 
wishing 
in 
this 
way 
to 
exempt 
themselves 
from 
the 
necessity 
of 
proving 
what 
they 
advance, 
on 
the 
pretext 
that 
those 
who 
will 
meditate 
on 
these 
ideas 
will 
find 
in 
them 
the 
same 
thing 
that 
they 
do; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
those 
who 
will 
accustom 
themselves 
to 
their 
manner 
of 
thinking 
will 
have 
the 
same 
prepossessions, 
which 
isverytrue. 



My 
opinion 
is, 
then, 
that 
nothing 
ought 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
primitive 
principles 
except 
experiences 
and 
the 
axiom 
of 
identity, 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
contradiction, 
which 
is 
primitive, 
since 
otherwise 
there 
would 
be 
no 
difference 
between 
truth 
and 
falsehood; 
and 
since 
all 
researches 
would 
cease 
at 
the 
start 
if 
to 
say 
yes 
or 
no 
were 
indifferent. 
We 
cannot, 
therefore, 
prevent 
ourselves 
from 
supposing 
this 
principle 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
wish 
to 
reason. 
All 
other 
truths 
are 
capable 
of 
proof, 
and 
I 
highly 
esteem 
Euclid’s 
method 
which, 
without 
stopping 
at 
what 
would 
be 
thought 
to 
be 
sufficiently 
proved 
by 
the 
so-called 
ideas, 
has 
proved, 
for 
example, 
that 
in 
a 
triangle 
one 
side 
is 
always 
less 
than 
the 
other 
two 
together. 
Yet 
Euclid 
was 
right 
in 
taking 
some 
axioms 
for 
granted, 
not 
as 
if 
they 
were 
truly 
primitive 
and 
undemonstrable, 
but 
because 
he 
would 
have 
come 
to 
a 
standstill 
if 
he 
had 
wished 
to 
draw 
conclusions 
only 
after 
an 
accurate 
discussion 
of 
principles. 
Thus 
he 
judged 
it 
proper 
to 
content 
himself 
with 
having 
pushed 
the 
proofs 
up 
to 
this 
small 
number 
of 
propositions, 
so 
that 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
if 
they 
are 
true, 
all 
that 
he 
says 
is 
also 
true. 
He 
has 
left 
to 
others 
the 
trouble 
of 
demonstrating 
these 
principles 
themselves 
which, 
besides, 
are 
already 
justified 
by 
experience; 
but 
inthesemattersthisdoesnotcontentus. 
ThisiswhyAppolonius,Proclusand 
others 
have 
taken 
the 
trouble 
to 
demonstrate 
some 
of 
Euclid’s 
axioms. 
This 
manner 
of 
proceeding 
ought 
to 
be 
imitated 
by 
philosophers 
in 
order 
to 
arrive 
finally 
at 
some 
established 
positions, 
even 
if 
they 
be 
but 
provisional, 
in 
the 
wayofwhichIhavejustspoken. 


As 
for 
ideas, 
I 
have 
given 
some 
explanation 
of 
them 
in 
a 
short 
essay 
entitled 
Meditationes 
de 
Cognitions, 
Veritate 
et 
Ideis, 
and 
I 
could 
have 
wished 
that 
Mr. 
Locke 
had 
seen 
and 
examined 
it; 
for 
I 
am 
one 
of 
the 
most 
docile 
of 
men, 
and 
nothing 
is 
more 
fitted 
to 
advance 
our 
thoughts 
than 
the 
considerations 
and 
remarks 
of 
persons 
of 
merit, 
when 
they 
are 
made 
with 
care 
and 
sincerity. 
Here 
I 
shall 
only 
say 
that 
true 
or 
real 
ideas 
are 
those 
of 
the 



possibility 
of 
whose 
fulfilment 
we 
are 
assured; 
the 
others 
are 
doubtful, 
or 
(in 
case 
of 
proof 
of 
impossibility), 
chimerical. 
How 
the 
possibility 
of 
ideas 
is 
proved 
as 
much 
a 
priori 
by 
demonstrations, 
by 
making 
use 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
other 
simpler 
ideas, 
as 
a 
posteriori 
by 
experience; 
for 
what 
is, 
cannot 
fail 
to 
be 
possible. 
But 
primitive 
ideas 
are 
those 
the 
possibility 
of 
which 
is 
undemonstrable, 
and 
which 
indeed 
are 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
attributes 
of 
God. 


As 
regards 
the 
question, 
whether 
there 
are 
ideas 
and 
truths 
created 
with 
as, 
I 
do 
not 
consider 
it 
absolutely 
necessary 
for 
the 
beginning 
nor 
for 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
art 
of 
thinking, 
to 
decide 
it; 
whether 
they 
all 
come 
to 
us 
from 
without, 
or 
whether 
they 
come 
from 
us, 
we 
will 
reason 
correctly 
if 
we 
observe 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said 
on 
this 
subject 
and 
if 
we 
proceed 
with 
order 
and 
without 
prejudice. 
The 
question 
concerning 
the 
origin 
of 
oar 
ideas 
and 
of 
our 
maxims 
is 
not 
preliminary 
in 
philosophy, 
and 
we 
must 
have 
made 
great 
progress 
to 
be 
able 
to 
answer 
it 
well. 
I 
think, 
however, 
that 
I 
can 
say 
that 
our 
ideas, 
even 
those 
of 
sensible 
things, 
come 
from 
within 
the 
soul 
[de 
notre 
propre 
fond], 
of 
which 
you 
may 
judge 
by 
what 
I 
have 
published 
concerning 
the 
nature 
and 
interaction 
of 
substances 
and 
what 
is 
called 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body. 
For 
I 
have 
found 
that 
these 
things 
had 
not 
been 
well 
understood. 
I 
am 
in 
no 
wise 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
Tabula 
rasa 
of 
Aristotle; 
and 
there 
is 
something 
sound 
in 
what 
Plato 
called 
reminiscence. 
There 
is 
even 
something 
more, 
for 
we 
have 
not 
only 
a 
reminiscence 
of 
all 
our 
past 
thoughts 
but 
also 
a 
presentiment 
of 
all 
our 
future 
thoughts. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
it 
is 
confusedly 
and 
without 
distinguishing 
them, 
very 
much 
as 
when 
I 
hear 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
ocean 
I 
hear 
that 
of 
all 
the 
waves 
In 
particular 
which 
make 
up 
the 
total 
sound, 
although 
it 
is 
without 
discerning 
one 
wave 
from 
another. 
And 
it 
is 
true 
in 
a 
certainsense, 
which 
I 
have 
explained,thatnot 
onlyour 
ideas 
but 
also 
our 
feelings, 
spring 
from 
within 
our 
own 
soul, 
and 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
more 



independent 
than 
is 
thought, 
although 
it 
is 
always 
true 
that 
nothing 
takes 
place 
in 
it 
which 
is 
not 
determined 
and 
that 
nothing 
is 
found 
in 
creatures 
which 
Goddoesnotcontinually 
create. 


In 
the 
second 
book, 
which 
goes 
into 
the 
details 
of 
ideas, 
I 
confess 
that 
Mr. 
Locke’s 
reasons 
for 
proving 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
sometimes 
without 
thought 
do 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
convincing, 
unless 
he 
gives 
the 
name 
of 
thoughts 
to 
only 
those 
perceptions 
sufficiently 
noticeable 
to 
be 
distinguished 
and 
retained. 
I 
hold 
that 
the 
soul 
and 
even 
the 
body 
is 
never 
without 
action, 
and 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
never 
without 
some 
perception. 
Even 
in 
dreamless 
sleep 
we 
have 
some 
confused 
and 
dim 
feeling 
of 
the 
place 
where 
we 
are 
and 
of 
other 
things. 
But 
even 
if 
experience 
should 
not 
confirm 
it, 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
may 
be 
demonstrated. 
It 
is 
very 
much 
as 
when 
we 
cannot 
prove 
absolutely 
by 
experience 
whether 
there 
is 
a 
vacuum 
in 
space, 
and 
whether 
there 
is 
rest 
in 
matter. 
And 
yet 
questions 
of 
this 
kind 
seem 
to 
me, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
Mr. 
Locke, 
to 
bedecideddemonstratively. 


I 
assent 
to 
the 
difference 
which 
he 
makes 
with 
great 
reason 
between 
matter 
and 
space. 
But 
as 
concerns 
the 
vacuum, 
many 
learned 
people 
have 
believed 
in 
it. 
Mr. 
Locke 
is 
of 
this 
number. 
I 
was 
almost 
persuaded 
of 
it 
myself, 
but 
I 
gave 
it 
up 
long 
ago. 
And 
the 
incomparable 
Mr. 
Huygens, 
who 
was 
also 
for 
a 
vacuum 
and 
for 
the 
atoms, 
began 
at 
last 
to 
reflect 
upon 
my 
reasons, 
as 
his 
letters 
can 
bear 
witness. 
The 
proof 
of 
a 
vacuum, 
taken 
from 
motion, 
of 
which 
Mr. 
Locke 
makes 
use, 
supposes 
that 
body 
is 
originally 
hard, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
inflexible 
parts. 
For 
in 
this 
case 
it 
would 
be 
true, 
whatever 
finite 
number 
of 
atoms 
might 
be 
taken, 
that 
motion 
could 
not 
take 
place 
without 
a 
vacuum, 
but 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
matter 
aredivisibleandpliable. 


There 
are 
some 
other 
things 
in 
this 
second 
book 
which 
arrest 
me; 
for 
example, 
when 
it 
is 
said, 
chapter 
XVII, 
that 
infinity 
is 
to 
be 
attributed 
only 
to 



Space, 
Time 
and 
Number. 
I 
believe 
with 
Mr. 
Locke 
that, 
strictly 
speaking, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
there 
is 
no 
space, 
no 
time 
and 
no 
number 
which 
is 
infinite, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
only 
true 
that 
however 
great 
may 
be 
a 
space, 
a 
time 
or 
a 
number, 
there 
is 
always 
another 
larger 
than 
it, 
ad 
infinitum; 
and 
that 
thus 
the 
true 
infinite 
is 
not 
found 
in 
a 
whole 
made 
up 
of 
parts. 
It 
is 
none 
the 
less, 
however, 
found 
elsewhere; 
namely, 
in 
the 
absolute, 
which 
is 
without 
parts 
and 
which 
has 
influence 
upon 
compound 
things 
because 
they 
result 
from 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
absolute. 
Hence 
the 
positive 
infinite 
being 
nothing 
else 
than 
the 
absolute, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
there 
is 
in 
this 
sense 
a 
positive 
idea 
of 
the 
infinite, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
anterior 
to 
that 
of 
the 
finite. 
For 
the 
rest, 
by 
rejecting 
a 
composite 
infinite, 
we 
do 
not 
deny 
what 
the 
geometricians, 
and 
especially 
the 
excellentMr. 
Newton,prove 
de 
Seriebus 
infinitis. 


As 
for 
what 
is 
said, 
chapter 
XXX, 
de 
ideis 
adaequatis, 
it 
is 
permissible 
to 
give 
to 
the 
terms 
the 
signification 
one 
finds 
apropos. 
Nevertheless, 
without 
finding 
fault 
with 
Locke’s 
meaning, 
I 
put 
degrees 
in 
ideas, 
according 
to 
which 
I 
call 
those 
adequate 
in 
which 
there 
is 
nothing 
more 
to 
explain 
very 
much 
as 
in 
numbers. 
Now 
all 
ideas 
of 
sensible 
qualities, 
as 
of 
light, 
color, 
heat, 
not 
being 
of 
this 
nature, 
I 
do 
not 
count 
them 
among 
the 
adequate;alsoit 
is 
not 
through 
themselves 
nor 
a 
priori, 
but 
by 
experience 
that 
we 
know 
their 
realityor 
possibility. 


There 
are 
again 
many 
good 
things 
in 
the 
third 
book, 
where 
he 
treats 
of 
words 
or 
terms. 
It 
is 
very 
true 
that 
everything 
cannot 
be 
defined, 
and 
that 
sensible 
qualities 
have 
no 
nominal 
definition 
and 
may 
be 
called 
primitive 
in 
this 
sense; 
but 
they 
can 
none 
the 
less 
receive 
a 
real 
definition. 
I 
have 
shown 
the 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
kinds 
of 
definition 
in 
the 
meditation 
quoted 
above. 
The 
nominal 
definition 
explains 
the 
name 
by 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
thing; 
but 
the 
real 
definition 
makes 
known 
a 
priori 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
thing 



defined. 
For 
the 
rest, 
I 
heartily 
approve 
of 
Mr. 
Locke’s 
doctrine 
concerning 
the 
demonstrability 
of 
moral 
truths. 


The 
fourth 
or 
last 
book, 
which 
treats 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
truth, 
shows 
the 
use 
of 
what 
has 
just 
been 
said. 
I 
find 
in 
it, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
preceding 
books, 
numberless 
beautiful 
reflections. 
To 
make 
fitting 
remarks 
upon 
them 
would 
be 
to 
make 
a 
hook 
as 
large 
as 
the 
work 
itself. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
axioms 
in 
it 
are 
a 
little 
less 
considered 
than 
they 
deserve 
to 
be. 
It 
is 
apparently 
because, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
those 
of 
the 
mathematicians, 
there 
are 
not 
ordinarily 
found 
any 
which 
are 
important 
and 
solid. 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
remedy 
this 
defect. 
I 
do 
not 
despise 
identical 
propositions, 
and 
I 
have 
found 
that 
they 
are 
of 
great 
service 
even 
in 
analysis. 
It 
is 
very 
true 
that 
we 
know 
our 
own 
existence 
by 
an 
immediate 
intuition, 
and 
that 
of 
God, 
by 
demonstration; 
and 
that 
a 
mass 
of 
matter, 
the 
parts 
of 
which 
are 
without 
perception, 
cannot 
make 
a 
whole 
which 
thinks. 
I 
do 
not 
despise 
the 
argument, 
invented 
some 
centuries 
ago 
by 
Anselm, 
which 
proves 
that 
the 
perfect 
being 
must 
exist; 
although 
I 
find 
something 
lacking 
in 
this 
argument, 
because 
it 
takes 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
perfect 
being 
is 
possible. 
For 
if 
this 
one 
point 
were 
proved 
in 
addition 
the 
whole 
demonstration 
wouldbe 
complete. 


As 
for 
the 
knowledge 
of 
other 
things, 
it 
is 
very 
well 
said 
that 
experience 
alone 
does 
not 
suffice 
for 
advancing 
sufficiently 
in 
physics. 
A 
penetrating 
mind 
will 
draw 
more 
conclusions 
from 
some 
very 
ordinary 
experiences 
than 
another 
could 
draw 
from 
the 
most 
choice; 
besides 
there 
is 
an 
art 
of 
experimenting 
and 
of 
interrogating, 
so 
to 
speak, 
nature. 
Yet 
it 
is 
always 
true 
that 
progress 
cannot 
be 
made 
in 
the 
details 
of 
physics 
except 
in 
proportion 
as 
one 
has 
experience. 


Mr. 
Locke 
is 
of 
the 
opinion, 
held 
by 
many 
able 
men, 
that 
the 
forms 
of 
logic 
are 
of 
little 
use. 
I 
should 
be 
almost 
of 
the 
opposite 
opinion; 
and 
I 
have 
often 
found 
that 
paralogisms, 
even 
in 
mathematics, 
are 
faults 
of 
form. 
Mr. 



Huygens 
has 
made 
the 
same 
observation. 
Much 
might 
be 
said 
on 
this 
point, 
and 
many 
excellent 
things 
are 
despised 
because 
the 
use 
of 
which 
they 
are 
capable 
is 
not 
made 
of 
them. 
We 
are 
prompted 
to 
despise 
what 
we 
have 
learned 
in 
the 
schools. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
we 
there 
learn 
many 
useless 
things, 
but 
it 
is 
good 
to 
exercise 
the 
function 
della 
Crusca, 
that 
is, 
to 
separate 
the 
good 
from 
the 
bad. 
Mr. 
Locke 
can 
do 
it 
as 
well 
as 
anyone 
whatsoever; 
and 
in 
addition 
he 
gives 
us 
important 
thoughts 
of 
his 
own. 
He 
is 
not 
only 
an 
assayer, 
but 
he 
is 
also 
a 
transmuter, 
by 
the 
augmentation 
which 
he 
makes 
of 
good 
metal. 
If 
he 
continued 
to 
make 
a 
present 
of 
it 
to 
the 
public 
we 
should 
be 
greatlyindebted 
tohim. 



ON 
THE 
ULTIMATE 
ORIGIN 
OFTHINGS. 
1697. 


[From 
the 
Latin.] 



IN 
ADDITION 
TO 
the 
world 
or 
aggregate 
of 
finite 
things, 
there 
is 
some 
uniqueBeingwho 
governs,notonlylike 
the 
soulin 
me, 
orrather 
liketheEgo 
itself 
in 
my 
body, 
but 
in 
a 
much 
higher 
relation. 
For 
one 
Being 
dominating 
theuniversenotonlyrulestheworld 
buthe 
creates 
andfashionsit,is 
superior 
to 
the 
world, 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
extra 
mundane, 
and 
by 
this 
very 
fact 
is 
the 
ultimate 
reason 
of 
things. 
For 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
of 
existence 
can 
be 
found 
neither 
in 
any 
particular 
thing 
nor 
in 
the 
whole 
aggregate 
or 
series. 
Suppose 
a 
book 
on 
the 
elements 
of 
geometry 
to 
have 
been 
eternal 
and 
that 
others 
had 
been 
successively 
copied 
after 
it, 
it 
is 
evident 
that, 
although 
we 
might 
account 
for 
the 
present 
book 
by 
the 
book 
which 
was 
its 
model, 
we 
could 
nevertheless 
never, 
by 
assuming 
any 
number 
of 
books 
whatever, 
reach 
a 
perfect 
reason 
for 
them; 
for 
we 
may 
always 
wonder 
why 
such 
books 
have 
existed 
from 
all 
time; 
that 
is, 
why 
books 
are 
and 
why 
they 
are 
thus 
written. 
What 
is 
true 
of 
books 
is 
also 
true 
of 
the 
different 
states 
of 
the 
world, 
for 
in 
spite 
of 
certain 
laws 
of 
transformation 
a 
succeeding 
state 
is 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
only 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
preceding, 
and 
to 
whatever 
anterior 
state 
you 
may 
go 
back 
you 
will 
never 
find 
there 
a 
perfect 
reason 
why, 
forsooth, 
there 
is 
any 
world 
at 
all, 
and 
such 
a 
world 
as 
exists. 
For 
even 
if 
you 
imagine 
the 
world 
eternal, 
nevertheless 
since 
you 
posit 
nothing 
but 
a 
succession 
of 
states, 
and 
as 
you 
find 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
them 
in 
none 
of 
them 
whatsoever, 
and 
as 
any 
number 
of 
them 
whatever 
does 
not 
aid 
you 
in 
giving 
a 
reason 
for 
them, 
it 
is 
evidentthatthe 
reason 
mustbe 
soughtelsewhere. 
For 
in 
eternalthings 
it 
must 
be 
understood 
that 
even 
where 
there 
is 
no 
cause 
there 
is 
a 
reason 
which, 
in 



perduring 
things, 
is 
necessity 
itself 
or 
essence, 
but 
in 
the 
series 
of 
changing 
things, 
if 
it 
were 
supposed 
that 
they 
succeed 
each 
other 
eternally, 
this 
reason 
would 
be, 
as 
will 
soon 
be 
seen, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
inclinations 
where 
the 
reasons 
are 
not 
necessitating 
(by 
an 
absolute 
or 
metaphysical 
necessity 
the 
opposite 
of 
which 
would 
imply 
contradiction), 
but 
inclining. 
From 
which 
it 
follows 
that 
by 
supposing 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
world, 
an 
ultimate 
extramundane 
reasonofthings, 
orGod,cannotbeescaped. 


The 
reasons 
of 
the 
world, 
therefore, 
lie 
hidden 
in 
something 
extramundane 
different 
from 
the 
chain 
of 
states 
or 
series 
of 
things, 
the 
aggregate 
of 
which 
constitutes 
the 
world. 
We 
must 
therefore 
pass 
from 
physical 
or 
hypothetical 
necessity, 
which 
determines 
the 
posterior 
states 
of 
the 
world 
by 
the 
prior, 
to 
something 
which 
is 
absolute 
or 
metaphysical 
necessity, 
the 
reason 
for 
which 
cannot 
he 
given. 
For 
the 
present 
world 
is 
necessary, 
physically 
or 
hypothetically, 
but 
not 
absolutely 
or 
metaphysically. 
It 
being 
granted, 
indeed, 
that 
the 
world 
is 
such 
as 
it 
is, 
it 
follows 
that 
things 
may 
hereafter 
be 
such 
as 
they 
are. 
But 
as 
the 
ultimate 
origin 
must 
be 
in 
something 
which 
is 
metaphysically 
necessary, 
and 
as 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
existing 
can 
only 
be 
from 
the 
existing, 
there 
must 
exist 
some 
one 
being 
metaphysically 
necessary, 
or 
whose 
essence 
is 
existence; 
and 
thus 
there 
exists 
something 
which 
differs 
from 
the 
plurality 
of 
beings 
or 
from 
the 
world, 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
recognized 
and 
shown, 
isnotmetaphysically 
necessary. 


But 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
a 
little 
more 
clearly 
how, 
from 
eternal 
or 
essential; 
or 
metaphysical 
truths, 
temporary, 
contingent 
or 
physical 
truths 
arise, 
we 
ought 
first 
to 
recognize 
that 
from 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
something 
exists 
rather 
than 
nothing, 
there 
is 
in 
possible 
things, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
very 
possibility 
or 
essence, 
a 
certain 
need 
of 
existence, 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
some 
claim 
to 
existence; 
in 
a 
word, 
that 
essence 
tends 
itself 
towards 
existence. 
Whence 
it 
further 
follows 
that 
all 
possible 
things, 
whether 
expressing 
essence 
or 



possible 
reality, 
tend 
by 
equal 
right 
toward 
existence, 
according 
to 
their 
quantity 
of 
essence 
or 
reality, 
or 
according 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
perfection 
which 
theycontain, 
for 
perfectionisnothingelsethanquantity 
ofessence. 


Hence 
it 
is 
most 
clearly 
understood 
that 
among 
the 
infinite 
combinations 
of 
possibles 
and 
possible 
series, 
that 
one 
exists 
by 
which 
the 
most 
of 
essence 
or 
of 
possibility 
is 
brought 
into 
existence. 
And 
indeed 
there 
is 
always 
in 
things 
a 
principle 
of 
determination 
which 
is 
to 
be 
taken 
from 
the 
greatest 
and 
the 
smallest, 
or 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
greatest 
effect 
is 
obtained 
with 
the 
least, 
so 
to 
speak, 
expenditure. 
And 
here 
the 
time, 
place, 
or 
as 
many 
say, 
the 
receptivity 
or 
capacity 
of 
‘the 
world 
may 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
expenditure 
or 
the 
ground 
which 
can 
he 
most 
easily 
built 
upon, 
whereas 
the 
varieties 
of 
forms 
correspond 
to 
the 
commodiousness 
of 
the 
edifice 
and 
the 
multiplicity 
and 
elegance 
of 
its 
chambers. 
And 
it 
is 
with 
it 
in 
this 
respect 
as 
with 
certain 
games 
where 
all 
the 
spaces 
on 
a 
table 
are 
to 
be 
filled 
according 
to 
determined 
laws. 
Now, 
unless 
a 
certain 
skill 
be 
employed, 
you 
will 
be 
finally 
excluded 
by 
unfavorable 
spaces 
and 
forced 
to 
leave 
many 
more 
places 
empty 
than 
you 
can 
or 
wish. 
But 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
very 
easy 
way 
of 
filling 
the 
most 
possible 
space. 
Just 
as, 
therefore, 
if 
it 
is 
resolved 
to 
make 
a 
triangle, 
there 
being 
no 
other 
determining 
reason, 
it 
commonly 
happens 
that 
an 
equilateral 
results; 
and 
if 
it 
is 
resolved 
to 
go 
from 
one 
point 
to 
another 
without 
any 
further 
determination 
as 
to 
the 
way, 
the 
easiest 
and 
shortest 
path 
will 
be 
chosen; 
so 
it 
being 
once 
posited 
that 
being 
is 
better 
than 
not 
being, 
or 
that 
there 
is 
a 
reason 
why 
something 
should 
be 
rather 
than 
nothing, 
or 
that 
we 
must 
pass 
from 
the 
possibility 
to 
the 
act, 
it 
follows 
that 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
every 
other 
determination 
the 
quantity 
of 
existence 
is 
as 
great 
as 
possible, 
regard 
being 
had 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
time 
and 
of 
the 
place 
(or 
to 
the 
possible 
order 
of 
existence), 
exactly 
as 
the 
squares 
are 
disposed 
in 
a 
given 
area 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
shall 
contain 
the 
greatest 
number 
of 
them 
possible. 
From 
this 
it 
is 
now 



marvellously 
understood 
how 
in 
the 
very 
origin 
of 
things 
a 
sort 
of 
divine 
mathematics 
or 
of 
metaphysical 
mechanism 
was 
employed, 
and 
how 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
greatest 
quantity 
of 
existence 
takes 
place. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
from 
all 
angles 
the 
determined 
angle 
in 
geometry 
is 
the 
right 
angle, 
and 
that 
liquids 
placed 
in 
heterogeneous 
positions 
take 
that 
form 
which 
has 
the 
most 
capacity, 
or 
the 
spherical; 
but 
especially 
it 
is 
thus 
that 
in 
ordinary 
mechanics 
itself, 
when 
several 
heavy 
bodies 
strive 
together 
the 
motion 
which 
results 
constitutes, 
on 
the 
whole, 
the 
greatest 
descent. 
For 
just 
as 
all 
the 
possibles 
tend 
by 
equal 
right 
to 
exist 
by 
reason 
of 
reality, 
so 
all 
weights 
tend 
by 
an 
equal 
right 
to 
descend 
by 
reason 
of 
their 
gravity; 
and 
as 
here 
a 
movement 
is 
produced 
which 
contains 
the 
greatest 
possible 
descent 
of 
heavy 
bodies, 
so 
there 
a 
world 
is 
produced 
in 
which 
is 
found 
realized 
the 
greatest 
number 
of 
possibles. 


And 
thus 
we 
now 
have 
physical 
necessity 
from 
metaphysical; 
for 
although 
the 
world 
be 
not 
metaphysically 
necessary, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
its 
contrary 
implies 
a 
contradiction 
or 
a 
logical 
absurdity, 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
physically 
necessary, 
or 
determined 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
its 
contrary 
implies 
imperfection 
or 
moral 
absurdity. 
And 
as 
possibility 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
essence, 
so 
perfection 
or 
the 
degree 
of 
essence 
(through 
which 
the 
greatest 
possible 
number 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
possible), 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
existence. 
Whence 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
author 
of 
the 
world 
is 
free, 
although 
he 
makes, 
all 
things 
determinately; 
for 
he 
acts 
according 
to 
a 
principle 
of 
wisdom 
or 
of 
perfection. 
Indeed 
indifference 
arises 
from 
ignorance, 
and 
the 
wiserone 
is,themoredetermined 
oneistothehighestdegree 
ofperfection. 


But, 
you 
will 
say, 
however 
ingenious 
this 
comparison 
of 
a 
certain 
determining 
metaphysical 
mechanism 
with 
the 
physical 
mechanism 
of 
heavy 
bodies 
may 
appear, 
nevertheless 
it 
fails 
in 
this, 
that 
heavy 
bodies 
truly 
exist, 
whereas 
possibilities 
and 
essences 
prior 
to 
existence 
or 
outside 
of 
it 
are 
only 



fancies 
or 
fictions 
in 
which 
the 
reason 
of 
existence 
cannot 
be 
sought. 
I 
answer, 
that 
neither 
these 
essences 
nor 
these 
so-called 
eternal 
truths, 
are 
fictious 
but 
that 
they 
exist 
in 
a 
certain 
region 
of 
ideas, 
if 
I 
may 
thus 
speak, 
that 
is 
in 
God 
himself, 
the 
source 
of 
all 
essences 
and 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
all 
else. 
And 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
actual 
series 
of 
things 
shows 
sufficiently 
of 
itself 
that 
my 
assertion 
is 
not 
gratuitous. 
For 
since 
the 
reason 
is 
not 
found 
in 
this 
series, 
as 
we 
have 
shown 
above, 
but 
must 
be 
sought 
in 
metaphysical 
necessities 
or 
eternal 
truths, 
and 
since 
that 
which 
exists 
can 
only 
come 
from 
that, 
which 
existed, 
as 
we 
have 
remarked 
above, 
eternal 
truths 
must 
have 
their 
existence 
in 
a 
certain 
subject 
absolutely 
and 
metaphysically 
necessary, 
that 
is 
in 
God, 
through 
whom 
those 
things 
which 
otherwise 
would 
be 
imaginary,are,tospeakbarbarously 
butsignificantly,realized. 


And 
in 
truth 
we 
discover 
that 
everything 
is 
done 
in 
the 
world 
according 
to 
the 
laws, 
not 
only 
geometrical 
but 
also 
metaphysical, 
of 
eternal 
truths; 
that 
is, 
not 
only 
according 
to 
material 
necessities, 
but 
also 
according 
to 
formal 
necessities; 
and 
this 
is 
true 
not 
only 
generally 
in 
that 
which 
concerns 
the 
reason, 
which 
we 
have 
just 
explained, 
of 
a 
world 
existing 
rather 
than 
non-
existing, 
and 
existing 
thus 
rather 
than 
otherwise 
(a 
reason 
which 
can 
only 
be 
found 
in 
the 
tendency 
of 
the 
possible 
to 
existence); 
but 
if 
we 
descend 
to 
the 
special 
we 
see 
the 
metaphysical 
laws 
of 
cause, 
of 
power, 
of 
action 
holding 
good 
in 
admirable 
manner 
in 
all 
nature, 
and 
prevailing 
over 
the 
purely 
geometrical 
laws 
themselves 
of 
matter, 
as 
I 
found 
in 
accounting 
for 
the 
laws 
of 
motion: 
a 
thing 
which 
struck 
me 
with 
such 
astonishment 
that, 
as 
I 
have 
explained 
more 
at 
length 
elsewhere, 
I 
was 
forced 
to 
abandon 
the 
law 
of 
the 
geometrical 
composition 
of 
forces 
which 
I 
had 
defended 
in 
my 
youth 
when 
I 
was 
more 
materialistic. 


Thus, 
therefore, 
we 
have 
the 
ultimate 
reason 
of 
the 
reality, 
as 
well 
of 
essences 
as 
of 
existences, 
in 
a 
Being 
who 
is 
necessarily 
much 
superior 
and 



anterior 
to 
the 
world 
itself, 
since 
it 
is 
from 
him 
that 
not 
only 
the 
existences 
which 
this 
world 
contains, 
but 
also 
the 
possibles 
themselves 
derive 
their 
reality. 
And 
this 
reason 
of 
things 
can 
be 
sought 
only 
in 
a 
single 
source, 
because 
of 
the 
connection 
which 
they 
all 
have 
with 
one 
another. 
But 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
it 
is 
from 
this 
source 
that 
existing 
things 
continually 
emanate, 
that 
they 
are 
and 
have 
been 
its 
products, 
for 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
why 
one 
state 
of 
the 
world 
rather 
than 
another, 
the 
state 
of 
to-day 
rather 
than 
that 
of 
tomorrow, 
should 
come 
from 
the 
world 
itself. 
We 
see, 
also, 
with 
the 
same 
clearness, 
how 
God 
acts, 
not 
only 
physically 
but 
freely; 
how 
the 
efficient 
and 
final 
cause 
of 
things 
is 
in 
him, 
and 
how 
he 
manifests 
not 
only 
his 
greatness 
and 
his 
power 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
world, 
but 
also 
his 
goodness 
and 
his 
wisdom 
in 
the 
creation. 
And 
in 
order 
that 
no 
one 
should 
think 
that 
we 
confound 
here 
moral 
perfection 
or 
goodness 
with 
metaphysical 
perfection 
or 
greatness, 
or 
that 
the 
former 
is 
denied 
while 
thelatter 
is 
granted, 
it 
must 
be 
known 
that 
it 
follows 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said 
that 
the 
world 
is 
most 
perfect, 
not 
physically, 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer, 
metaphysically, 
because 
that 
series 
of 
things 
is 
produced 
in 
which 
there 
is 
the 
most 
reality 
in 
action, 
but 
also 
that 
it 
is 
most 
perfect 
morally, 
because 
really 
moral 
perfection 
is 
physical 
perfection 
for 
souls 
themselves. 
Thus 
the 
world 
is 
not 
only 
the 
most 
admirable 
machine, 
but 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
souls, 
it 
is 
also 
the 
best 
republic, 
through 
which 
as 
much 
happiness 
or 
joy 
is 
brought 
to 
souls 
as 
is 
possible,inwhichtheirphysicalperfection 
consists. 


But, 
you 
will 
say, 
we 
experience 
the 
contrary 
in 
this 
world, 
for 
often 
good 
people 
are 
very 
unhappy, 
and 
not 
only 
innocent 
brutes 
but 
also 
innocent 
men 
are 
afflicted 
and 
even 
put 
to 
death 
with 
torture; 
finally, 
the 
world, 
if 
you 
regard 
especially 
the 
government 
of 
the 
human 
race, 
resembles 
a 
sort 
of 
confused 
chaos 
rather 
than 
the 
well 
ordered 
work 
of 
a 
supreme 
wisdom. 
This 
may 
appearsoat 
thefirstglance, 
Iconfess,butifyou 
examine 
the 
thingmore 



closely, 
it 
evidently 
appears 
from 
the 
things 
which 
have 
been 
alleged, 
that 
the 
contrary 
should 
be 
affirmed; 
that 
is, 
that 
all 
things 
and 
consequently 
souls 
attain 
tothehighestdegreeofperfectionpossible. 
Andintruth 
itisnotproper 
to 
judge 
before 
having 
examined, 
as 
the 
jurisconsults 
say, 
the 
whole 
law. 
We 
know 
only 
a 
very 
small 
part 
of 
the 
eternity 
which 
extends 
into 
immensity; 
for 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
few 
thousands 
of 
years 
which 
history 
transmits 
to 
us 
are 
indeed 
a 
very 
little 
thing. 
And 
yet 
from 
an 
experience 
so 
short 
we 
dare 
to 
judge 
of 
the 
immense 
and 
of 
the 
eternal, 
like 
men 
who, 
born 
and 
brought 
up 
in 
a 
prison, 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer 
in 
the 
subterranean 
salt 
mines 
of 
the 
Sarmatae, 
think 
that 
there 
is 
no 
other 
light 
in 
the 
world 
than 
the 
lamp 
whose 
feeble 
gleam 
hardly 
suffices 
to 
direct 
their 
steps. 
Let 
us 
look 
at 
a 
very 
beautiful 
picture, 
and 
let 
us 
cover 
it 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
see 
only 
a 
very 
small 
part 
of 
it, 
what 
else 
will 
appear 
in 
it 
however 
closely 
we 
may 
examine 
it 
and 
however 
near 
we 
may 
approach 
to 
it, 
except 
a 
certain 
confused 
mass 
of 
colors 
without 
choice 
and 
without 
art? 
And 
yet 
when 
we 
remove 
the 
covering 
and 
regard 
it 
from 
the 
proper 
point 
of 
view 
we 
will 
see 
that 
what 
appeared 
thrown 
on 
the 
canvas 
at 
haphazard 
has 
been 
executed 
with 
the 
greatest 
art 
by 
the 
author 
of 
the 
work. 
What 
the 
eyes 
discover 
in 
the 
picture, 
the 
ears 
discover 
in 
music. 
The 
most 
illustrious 
composers 
often 
introduce 
discords 
into 
their 
harmonies, 
in 
order 
to 
excite 
and 
pique, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
listener, 
who, 
anxious 
as 
to 
the 
outcome, 
is 
all 
the 
more 
pleased 
when 
soon 
all 
things 
are 
restored 
to 
order. 
Just 
as 
we 
rejoice 
to 
have 
passed 
through 
slight 
dangers 
and 
experienced 
small 
ills, 
whether 
because 
of 
a 
feeling 
of 
egotism, 
or 
because 
we 
find 
pleasure 
in 
the 
frightful 
images 
which 
tight-rope 
dances 
or 
leapings 
between 
swords 
present; 
so 
we 
partly 
loose 
laughing 
children, 
pretending 
to 
throw 
them 
far 
away 
from 
us, 
like 
the 
ape 
which, 
having 
taken 
Christian, 
king 
of 
the 
Danes, 
while 
still 
an 
infant 
wrapped 
in 
swaddling 
clothes, 
carried 
him 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
roof, 
and 
when 
everybody 
was 
frightened 
brought 
him 
back 



laughing, 
safe 
and 
sound 
to 
his 
cradle. 
According 
to 
the 
same 
principle, 
it 
is 
insipid 
always 
to 
eat 
sweetmeats; 
we 
must 
mingle 
with 
them 
sharp, 
acid 
and 
even 
bitter 
things, 
which 
excite 
the 
taste. 
He 
who 
has 
not 
tasted 
bitter 
things 
has 
not 
merited 
sweet 
things 
and 
even 
will 
not 
appreciate 
them. 
It 
is 
the 
law 
even 
of 
joy 
that 
pleasure 
be 
not 
uniform, 
for 
it 
engenders 
disgust, 
renders 
us 
stupid 
andnotjoyous. 


As 
to 
what 
we 
said, 
that 
a 
part 
may 
he 
disturbed 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
general 
harmony, 
it 
must 
not 
be 
understood 
as 
meaning 
that 
no 
account 
is 
made 
of 
the 
parts, 
or 
that 
it 
suffices 
that 
the 
entire 
world 
be 
perfect 
in 
measure, 
although 
it 
might 
happen 
that 
the 
human 
race 
should 
be 
unhappy, 
and 
that 
thereshouldbe 
in 
theuniverseno 
regard 
for 
justice, 
no 
heedtaken 
of 
our 
lot, 
as 
some 
think 
who 
do 
not 
judge 
rightly 
enough 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
things. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
known 
that 
as 
in 
a 
well-constituted 
republic 
as 
much 
care 
as 
possible 
is 
taken 
of 
the 
good 
of 
the 
individual, 
so 
the 
universe 
cannot 
be 
perfect 
if 
individual 
interests 
are 
not 
protected 
as 
much 
as 
the 
universal 
harmony 
will 
permit. 
And 
here 
a 
better 
law 
could 
not 
be 
established 
than 
the 
very 
law 
of 
justice 
which 
wills 
that 
each 
one 
participate 
in 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
in 
a 
happiness 
of 
his 
own 
proportioned 
to 
his 
own 
virtue 
and 
to 
the 
good 
will 
he 
entertains 
toward 
the 
common 
good, 
by 
which 
that 
which 
we 
call 
the 
charity 
and 
love 
of 
God 
is 
fulfilled, 
in 
which 
alone, 
according 
to 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
wisest 
theologians, 
the 
force 
and 
power 
of 
the 
Christian 
religion 
itself 
consists. 
And 
it 
ought 
not 
appear 
astonishing 
that 
so 
large 
a 
part 
should 
be 
given 
to 
souls 
in 
the 
universe 
since 
they 
reflect 
the 
most 
faithfulimageof 
thesupremeAuthor,and 
holdtohimnot 
only 
the 
relation

to

butalsothatof

areto

as 
long 
as 
the

and 
in 
a 
manner

and

As 
regards 
especially 
the 
afflictions 
of 
good 
people, 
we 
must 
hold 
for 
certain 
that 
there 
results 
for 
them 
a 
greater 
good, 
and 
this 
is 
not 
only 
theologically 
but 
physically 
true. 
So 
grain 
cast 
into 
the 
ground 
suffers 
before 
producing 
its 
fruit. 
And 
we 
may 
affirm, 
generally, 
that 
afflictions, 
temporarily 
evil, 
are 
in 
effect 
good, 
since 
they 
are 
short 
cuts 
to 
greater 
perfections. 
So 
in 
physics, 
liquors 
which 
ferment 
slowly 
take 
more 
time 
also 
to 
improve; 
whereas 
those 
the 
agitation 
of 
which 
is 
greater, 
reject 
certain 
partswithmoreforceandaremorepromptlyimproved. 


And 
we 
might 
say 
of 
this 
that 
it 
is 
retreating 
in 
order 
the 
better 
to 
leap 
forward 
(qu’on 
recede, 
pour 
mieux 
sauter). 


We 
should 
therefore 
regard 
these 
considerations 
not 
merely 
as 
agreeable 
and 
consoling, 
but 
also 
as 
most 
true. 
And, 
in 
general, 
I 
feel 
that 
there 
is 
nothingtruerthan 
happiness,and 
nothing 
happier 
nor 
sweeterthan 
truth. 



REPLY 
TO 
REFLECTIONS, 
FOUND 
IN 
THE 
“JOURNAL 
DES 
SAVONS.” 



OF 
THIS 
YEAR, 
RELATING 
TO 
THE 
CONSEQUENCES 
OF 
CERTAIN 


PASSAGESOFTHEPHILOSOPHYOFDESCARTES. 
1697. 


[FromtheFrench.] 


I 
AM 
accused 
of 
wishing 
to 
establish 
my 
reputation 
on 
the 
ruins 
of 
that 
of 
Descartes. 
I 
have 
a 
right 
to 
complain 
of 
this. 
Very 
far 
from 
wishing 
to 
ruin 
the 
reputation 
of 
this 
great 
man, 
I 
find 
that 
his 
real 
merit 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
known, 
because 
what 
is 
most 
excellent 
in 
him 
is 
not 
enough 
considered’ 
and 
imitated. 
Men 
fasten 
on 
the 
weakest 
passages 
because 
these 
are 
most 
easily 
understood 
by 
those 
who 
are 
not 
willing 
to 
give 
themselves 
the 
trouble 
of 
thinking 
profoundly 
and 
who 
yet 
would 
like 
to 
understand 
the 
foundation 
of 
things. 
This 
is 
why, 
to 
my 
great 
regret, 
his 
partisans 
add 
almost 
nothing 
to 
his 
discoveries, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
usual 
effect 
of 
the 
sectarian 
spirit 
in 
philosophy. 
As 
all 
my 
views 
are 
intent 
only 
upon 
the 
public 
good, 
I 
have 
said 
something 
from 
time 
to 
time 
to 
arouse 
them, 
well 
knowing 
that 
their 
penetration 
would 
lead 
them 
very 
far, 
if 
they 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
their 
master 
had 
done 
enough. 
I 
have 
always 
declared 
that 
I 
esteem 
Descartes 
exceedingly; 
there 
are 
few 
who 
approach 
him 
in 
genius. 
I 
know 
but 
Archimides, 
Copernicus, 
Galileo, 
Kepler, 
Jung, 
Huygens, 
Newton, 
and 
a 
few 
others 
of 
such 
force; 
to 
whom 
Pythagoras, 
Democritus, 
Plato, 
Aristotle, 
Suisset, 
Cardan, 
Gilbert, 
Verulam, 
Campanella, 
Harvey, 
Pascal, 
and 
some 
others 
might 
be 
added. 
It 
is 
nevertheless 
true 
that 
Descartes 
has 
made 
use 
of 
artifice 
in 
order 
to 
profit 
by 



the 
discoveries 
of 
others, 
without 
wishing 
to 
appear 
indebted 
to 
them. 
He 
treated 
some 
excellent 
men 
in 
an 
unjust 
and 
unworthy 
way 
when 
they 
offended 
him, 
and 
he 
had 
an 
unbridled 
ambition 
to 
set 
himself 
up 
as 
a 
party 
chief. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
diminish 
the 
beauty 
of 
his 
thoughts. 
Far 
from 
approving 
those 
who 
despise 
him 
and 
who 
repay 
merit 
with 
ingratitude, 
it 
is 
this 
that 
I 
blame 
principally 
in 
Descartes, 
and 
still 
more 
in 
several 
of 
his 
partisans, 
whose 
misunderstood 
attachment 
for 
a 
single 
author 
nourishes 
prejudice 
and 
hinders 
them 
from 
profiting 
by 
the 
light 
of 
so 
many 
others. 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
say 
that 
the 
Cartesian 
philosophy 
is 
as 
it 
were 
the 
antechamber 
of 
the 
truth, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
penetrate 
far 
beyond 
without 
havingpassedthroughthis;butonedepriveshimselfofthe 
trueknowledgeof 
theheartofthingsifhe 
stopsthere. 


As 
for 
the 
little 
of 
reputation 
which 
I 
am 
honored 
by 
having 
accorded 
me, 
I 
have 
not 
acquired 
it 
in 
refuting 
Descartes; 
I 
have 
no 
need 
of 
that 
means; 
law, 
history 
and 
letters 
contributed 
to 
it 
before 
I 
had 
thought 
of 
mathematics. 
And 
if 
our 
new 
analysis, 
the 
calculus 
of 
which 
I 
have 
propounded, 
surpasses 
that 
of 
Descartes 
as 
much 
and 
more 
than 
his 
surpassed 
preceding 
methods, 
his 
remains 
none 
the 
less 
very 
worthy 
of 
esteem, 
although 
it 
has 
been 
necessary 
for 
the 
progress 
of 
science 
to 
disabuse 
those 
who 
think 
it 
suffices 
for 
everything; 
which 
cannot 
better 
be 
done 
than 
by 
proposing 
to 
them 
problems, 
beautiful 
and 
attractive, 
and, 
for 
those 
who 
know 
their 
method, 
even 
simple, 
but 
which 
not 
one 
of 
the 
Cartesian 
analysts 
has 
been 
able 
to 
solve. 


**** 


Let 
us 
come 
now 
to 
the 
heart 
of 
our 
dispute. 
I 
am 
not 
the 
first 
who 
has 
blamed 
Descartes 
for 
having 
rejected 
the 
search 
for 
final 
causes. 
Besides 
the 
Rev. 
Father 
Malebranche, 
the 
late 
Mr. 
Boyle 
did 
so 
with 
much 
zeal 
and 



solidity; 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
numerous 
other 
grave, 
moderate 
and 
well-disposed 
authors, 
men 
who 
otherwise 
make 
much 
of 
Descartes. 
The 
reply 
is 
here 
made 
that 
he 
banished 
final 
causes 
from 
physics, 
and 
that 
he 
was 
right 
in 
so 
doing, 
but 
that 
he 
would 
have 
been 
wrong 
if 
he 
had 
banished 
them 
from 
ethics: 
For 
the 
‘whole 
good 
and 
the 
whole 
evil 
of 
our 
free 
actions 
depends 
upon 
their 
end. 
This 
reply 
is 
surprising. 
The 
question 
is 
not 
concerning 
our 
free 
actions, 
but 
concerning 
God 
and 
his 
wisdom, 
which 
appears 
among 
the 
things 
which 
Descartes 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
neglected. 
And 
the 
reply, 
far 
from 
excusing 
him, 
would 
charge, 
if 
it 
were 
true, 
that 
according 
to 
him 
final 
causes 
belong 
only 
to 
our 
free 
actions. 
But 
I 
suppose 
that 
this 
is 
not 
the 
view 
of 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Reflections, 
nor 
that 
of 
Descartes. 
Nevertheless, 
his 
silence 
might 
be 
prejudicial 
to 
his 
intention. 
He 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
avail 
himself 
of 
this 
means 
of 
proving 
the 
existence 
of 
God; 
he 
may 
be 
excused 
on 
this 
point, 
although 
many 
have 
blamed 
him 
for 
it; 
but 
he 
has 
not 
done 
well 
in 
otherwise 
everywhere 
passing 
by 
so 
important 
a 
point, 
which 
ought 
to 
have 
been 
employed 
in 
some 
passages 
of 
his 
Principles 
of 
Philosophy. 
If 
God 
is 
the 
author 
of 
things 
and 
if 
he 
is 
sovereignly 
wise, 
one 
could 
not 
very 
well 
reason 
as 
to 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
universe 
without 
making 
considerations 
of 
his 
wisdom 
enter 
therein, 
just 
as 
one 
could 
not 
well 
reason 
concerning 
a 
building 
without 
entering 
into 
the 
designs 
of 
the 
architect. 
I 
have 
adduced 
elsewhere 
an 
excellent 
passage 
from 
the 
Phaedo 
of 
Plato 
(which 
is 
the 
dialogue 
on 
the 
death 
of 
Socrates), 
where 
the 
philosopher 
Anaximander, 
who 
had 
posited 
two 
principles, 
an 
intelligent 
mind 
and 
matter, 
is 
blamed 
for 
not 
having 
employed 
this 
intelligence 
or 
this 
wisdom 
in 
the 
progress 
of 
his 
work, 
having 
contented 
himself 
with 
the 
figures 
and 
motions 
of 
matter; 
and 
this 
is 
exactly 
the 
case 
withourtoomaterialistic 
modern 
philosophers. 


But, 
it 
is 
said, 
in 
physics 
we 
do 
not 
ask 
why 
things 
are 
but 
how 
they 
are. 
I 
reply 
that 
both 
questions 
are 
there 
asked. 
Often 
we 
can 
better 
judge 
of 
the 



means 
by 
the 
end. 
Besides 
to 
explain 
a 
machine 
we 
could 
not 
do 
better 
than 
to 
state 
its 
design 
and 
to 
show 
how 
all 
its 
parts 
conduce 
thereto. 
This 
may 
even 
be 
useful 
in 
finding 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
intention. 
I 
wish 
that 
this 
method 
were 
employed 
also 
in 
medicine. 
The 
animal 
body 
is 
a 
machine, 
at 
once 
hydraulic, 
pneumatic 
and 
pyrobolic, 
the 
design 
of 
which 
is 
to 
maintain 
a 
certain 
motion; 
and 
by 
showing 
what 
conduces 
to 
this 
design 
and 
what 
is 
injurious 
to 
it, 
physiology 
as 
well 
as 
therapeutics, 
would 
be 
understood. 
Thus 
it 
is 
seen 
that 
final 
causes 
are 
of 
service 
in 
physics, 
not 
only 
to 
make 
us 
admire 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God, 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
reason, 
but 
also 
for 
knowing 
things 
and 
for 
managing 
them. 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
shown 
that 
whereas 
we 
may 
still 
dispute 
as 
to 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
light, 
which 
Descartes, 
as 
the 
most 
intelligent 
now 
acknowledge, 
has 
not 
sufficiently 
well 
explained, 
yet 
the 
final 
cause 
suffices 
for 
divining 
the 
laws 
which 
it 
follows, 
for 
provided 
we 
imagine 
that 
nature 
had 
as 
its 
design 
the 
conducting 
of 
rays 
from 
a 
given 
point 
to 
another 
given 
point 
by 
the 
easiest 
path, 
we 
find 
all 
these 
laws 
admirably, 
by 
simply 
employing, 
as 
I 
have 
done 
in 
the 
Acta 
Eruditorum 
of 
Leipsic, 
some 
lines 
of 
analysis 
— 
Molinenx 
thanked 
me 
for 
this 
in 
his 
Dioptrics, 
and 
he 
highly 
approved 
of 
the 
remark, 
which 
I 
made 
on 
the 
occasion, 
on 
the 
important 
use 
of 
final 
causes, 
which 
lead 
us 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
Sovereign 
Wisdom, 
in 
showing 
us 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
laws 
ofnaturewhichareitsconsequence. 


The 
author 
of 
the 
Reflections 
asks 
me 
to 
give 
the 
passage 
where 
Descartes 
says 
that 
matter 
receives 
successively 
all 
the 
forms 
of 
which 
it 
is 
capable. 
He 
has 
searched 
Articles 
203 
and 
204 
of 
the 
fourth 
part 
of 
his 
Principles 
for 
it. 
But 
it 
is 
found 
in 
Article 
47 
of 
the 
third 
part. 
I 
shall 
quote 
it 
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
original 
Latin. 
The 
author 
remarks 
in 
the 
summary 
that 
the 
falsity 
of 
his 
suppositions 
regarding 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
world 
could 
not 
be 
injurious, 
and 
to 
prove 
it 
the 
better 
he 
adds: 
“Atque 
omnino 
parum 
refert 
quid 
hoc 
pacto 



supponatur, 
quia 
postea 
juxta 
leges 
naturae 
est 
mutandum. 
Et 
vix 
aliquid 
supponi 
potest, 
ex 
quo 
non 
idem 
effectua 
(quanquam 
fortasse 
operosius), 
per 
easdem 
naturae 
leges 
deduci 
possit. 
Cum 
earum 
ope 
materia 
formas 
omnes, 
quarum 
est 
capax, 
successive 
assumat, 
si 
formas 
istas 
ordine 
consideremus, 
tandem 
ad 
illam 
quaeest 
hujusmodipoterimus 
devenire.” 
From 
this 
itmay 
be 
judged 
whether 
I 
have 
imposed 
upon 
this 
author, 
and 
whether 
he 
does 
not 
say 
positively 
not 
only 
that 
matter 
can 
take, 
but 
also 
that 
it 
does 
take 
effectively 
as 
well 
as 
successively, 
all 
the 
forms 
of 
which 
it 
is 
susceptible, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
thus 
of 
little 
importance 
what 
suppositions 
are 
made. 
There 
is 
much 
to 
be 
said 
against 
this 
reasoning. 
In 
order 
to 
sustain 
it, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
same 
state 
of 
the 
universe 
returns 
always 
precisely 
after 
a 
certain 
period; 
since 
otherwise, 
a 
state 
of 
the 
world 
being 
taken 
which 
is 
posterior 
in 
fact 
to 
another, 
this 
latter 
state 
could 
never 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
former, 
even 
ifmatter 
should; 
receive 
all 
the 
formsof 
which 
itis 
capable. 
But 
these 
periods 
involve 
other 
difficulties, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
thus 
all 
the 
infinite 
possibilities 
would 
have 
to 
occur 
in 
this 
finite, 
periodic 
interval; 
and 
all 
eternity 
could 
produce 
nothing 
new. 
To 
say, 
also, 
with 
Descartes, 
that 
he 
is 
at 
liberty 
to 
suppose 
almost 
anything 
he 
wishes, 
it 
would 
not 
suffice 
that 
each 
supposition 
or 
hypothesis 
should 
finally 
lead 
to 
our 
world; 
for 
it 
might 
be 
so 
distant 
and 
thepassage 
from 
oneto 
theother 
might 
besolongandso 
difficult 
that 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
to 
follow 
it 
and 
to 
comprehend 
it. 
But 
the 
only 
proposition 
here 
in 
question 
is 
the 
one 
I 
have 
adduced, 
and 
the 
strange 
consequences 
of 
which 
I 
have 
noted: 
for 
if 
everything 
possible, 
and 
everything 
imaginable, 
however 
unworthy 
it 
be, 
someday 
comesto 
pass;ifeveryfableorfiction 
has 
beenorwill 
becometrue 
history, 
there 
is 
naught 
but 
necessity, 
and 
no 
choice, 
no 
providence. 
And 
this 
consequence 
it 
is 
that 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Reflections 
does 
not 
disown, 
he 



having 
simply 
undertaken 
to 
disprove 
the 
proposition 
itself, 
which 
he 
did 
not 
find 
inthe 
Principles 
ofitsauthor. 


Nevertheless 
I 
am 
unwilling 
to 
attack 
the 
religion 
and 
piety 
of 
Descartes, 
as 
is 
unjustly 
imputed 
to 
me. 
I 
protested 
the 
contrary 
in 
express 
terms, 
for 
a 
doctrine 
may 
he 
dangerous, 
without 
the 
one 
circulating 
it, 
or 
the 
one 
following 
it, 
remarking 
the 
fact 
or 
approving 
its 
consequences. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
well 
to 
make 
them 
known, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
we 
may 
be 
on 
our 
guard 
against 
them, 
forasmuch 
as 
it 
clearly 
appears 
that 
Spinoza 
and 
some 
others 
have 
drawn 
them. 
For 
there 
are 
minds 
disposed 
to 
seize 
upon 
the 
worst 
passages, 
and 
ingenious 
in 
deducing 
the 
most 
dangerous 
conclusions. 
I 
would 
not 
have 
spoken 
of 
Spinoza 
if 
I 
had 
thought 
that 
what 
I 
wrote 
would 
be 
published, 
from 
the 
fear 
that 
it 
would 
be 
believed 
that 
I 
wished 
to 
cast 
odium 
upon 
the 
Cartesians, 
knowing 
well 
that 
they 
have 
sometimes 
been 
wronged 
by 
mistaken 
zeal. 
Nevertheless, 
since 
there 
is 
a 
desire 
to 
criticize 
my 
words 
it 
has 
been 
necessary 
to 
show 
that 
I 
have 
advanced 
nothing 
groundlessly. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
best 
uses 
of 
true 
philosophy, 
and 
particularly 
of 
physics, 
is 
to 
nourish 
piety 
and 
to 
lead 
us 
to 
God, 
I 
am 
not 
ill-pleased 
with 
those 
who 
have 
given 
me 
this 
occasion 
for 
explaining 
myself 
in 
a 
way 
which 
may 
make 
good 
impressionsonsomeone;althoughIcouldwishthatit 
hadbeen 
donewithout 
attributing 
to 
me 
a 
passion 
and 
partiality, 
from 
which, 
perhaps, 
few 
people 
are 
more 
removed 
than 
I. 
To 
express 
in 
few 
words 
the 
feeling 
which 
I 
have 
toward 
an 
author 
whose 
reputation 
I 
am 
wrongly 
accused 
of 
wishing 
to 
ruin 
(an 
enterprise 
which 
would 
be 
as 
unjust 
as 
it 
is 
impossible), 
I 
will 
say 
that 
he 
who 
does 
not 
acknowledge 
the 
eminent 
merit 
of 
Descartes 
is 
not 
very 
penetrating; 
but 
that 
he 
who 
acknowledges 
and 
esteems 
none 
but 
him 
and 
thosewho 
followhim,willneveramountto 
much. 



ON 
NATURE 
IN 
ITSELF; 
OR, 
ON 
THE 
FORCE 
RESIDING 
IN 
CREATED 
THINGS, 
AND 
THEIR 
ACTIONS. 
1698. 


[From 
the 
Latin.] 



(1). 
I 
HAVE 
recently 
received 
from 
the 
very 
illustrious 
John 
Christopher 
Sturm,a 
man 
especially 
meritorious 
forhis 
work 
in 
mathematics 
and 
physics, 
the 
Apology 
which 
he 
published 
at 
Altorf 
in 
defence 
of 
his 
Dissertation, 
De 
Idolo 
Naturae, 
which 
Gunther 
Christopher 
Schelhammer, 
the 
eminent 
and 
beloved 
physician 
of 
Kiel, 
attacked 
in 
his 
hook 
on 
nature. 
As 
I 
have 
formerly 
examined 
the 
same 
question, 
and 
as 
I 
have 
had 
by 
letters 
some 
discussions 
on 
this 
subject 
with 
the 
eminent 
author 
of 
the 
Dissertation, 
mention 
of 
which 
he 
made 
in 
a 
way 
very 
gratifying 
to 
me 
in 
recalling 
publicly 
some 
details 
of 
our 
correspondence 
in 
the 
first 
volume 
of 
his 
Select 
Physics 
(Vol. 
I, 
Sec. 
1, 
Chap. 
3, 
epilog. 
§v, 
pp. 
119, 
120), 
I 
have 
been 
thereby 
but 
the 
more 
disposed 
to 
give 
serious 
attention 
to 
such 
an 
important 
subject, 
judging 
it 
necessary 
that 
my 
view 
and 
the 
whole 
question 
should 
be 
a 
little 
more 
distinctly 
set 
forth 
from 
those 
principles 
which 
I 
have 
already 
often 
indicated. 
This 
apologetic 
dissertation 
seemed 
to 
me 
to 
offer 
an 
opportunity 
favorable 
to 
my 
design, 
because 
it 
was 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
the 
author 
had 
there 
treated 
in 
a 
few 
words 
the 
essential 
points 
of 
the 
question. 
For 
the 
rest 
I 
do 
not 
take 
sides 
between 
these 
illustriousmen. 


(2) 
—. 
Two 
points 
especially, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
areinquestion: 
first, 
in 
what 
consists 
the 
nature 
which 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
attribute 
to 
things, 
the 
commonly 
received 
attributes 
of 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
celebrated 
Sturm, 
savor 
a 
little 
of 
paganism; 
next, 
whether 
there 
is 
in 
creatures 
any 
ενεργεια, 
a 
thing 
which 
he 
appears 
to 
deny. 
As 
for 
the 
first 

point, 
concerning 
nature 
in 
itself, 
if 
we 
examine 
what 
it 
is 
and 
what 
it 
is 
not, 
I 
admit 
indeed 
that 
there 
is 
no 
soul 
of 
the 
universe; 
I 
even 
admit 
that 
these 
marvels, 
which 
happen 
every 
day 
and 
of 
which 
we 
are 
wont 
to 
say 
with 
reason 
that 
the 
work 
of 
nature 
is 
the 
work 
of 
an 
intelligence, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
certain 
created 
intelligences 
endowed 
with 
a 
wisdom 
and 
virtue 
proportioned 
to 
so 
great 
a 
matter; 
but 
that 
universal 
nature 
is, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
handiwork 
of 
God, 
and 
one 
so 
great 
that 
every 
natural 
machine 
(and 
this 
is 
the 
true 
but 
little 
observed 
difference 
between 
nature 
and 
art) 
is 
composed 
of 
really 
infinite 
organs, 
and 
consequently 
requires 
in 
the 
author 
and 
director 
infinite 
wisdom 
and 
power. 
This 
is 
why 
I 
hold 
the 
omniscient 
heat 
of 
Hippocrates 
and 
the 
soul-giving 
Cholco-goddess 
of 
Avicenna 
and 
the 
very 
wise 
plastic 
virtue 
of 
Scaliger 
and 
others 
and 
the 
hylarchic 
principle 
of 
Henry 
More, 
some 
of 
them 
impossible, 
others 
superfluous; 
and 
it 
is 
enough 
for 
me 
that 
the 
mechanism 
of 
things 
is 
constructed 
with’ 
so 
much 
wisdom 
that 
all 
these 
marvels 
come 
to 
pass 
through 
its 
very 
development, 
organized 
beings 
being 
evolved, 
I 
think, 
according 
to 
a 
preconceived 
plan. 
I 
am 
therefore 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
illustrious 
author 
when 
he 
rejects 
the 
figment 
of 
a 
certain 
created 
nature, 
whose 
wisdom 
forms 
and 
governs 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
bodies-’, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
hence 
follow, 
I 
believe, 
and 
reason 
does 
not 
admit, 
that 
all 
created, 
indwelling, 
active 
force 
must 
be 
rejected, 
(3.) 
We 
have 
just 
spoken 
of 
what 
it 
is 
not; 
let 
us 
now 
examine 
more 
closely 
what 
this 
nature 
is 
which 
Aristotle 
was 
not 
wrong 
in 
calling 
the 
principle 
of 
motion 
and 
of 
rest, 
although 
this 
philosopher 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
take 
the 
word 
in 
too 
broad 
a 
meaning, 
and 
understand 
by 
it 
not 
only 
local 
motion 
or 
rest 
in 
a 
place, 
but 
in 
general 
change 
and 
στασις 
or 
persistence. 
Whence, 
also, 
as 
I 
may 
say 
in 
passing, 
the 
definition 
which 
he 
gives 
of 
motion 
is 
truly 
obscure; 
it 
is, 
however, 
not 
so 
absurd 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
those 
who 
suppose 
that 
he 
meant 
to 
define 
only 
local 
motion. 
But 
let 
us 
return 
to 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
Robert 



Boyle, 
a 
man 
eminent 
and 
skilled 
in 
the 
accurate 
observation 
of 
nature, 
has 
written 
on 
nature 
in 
itself 
a 
little 
book, 
the 
thought 
of 
which, 
if 
I 
remember 
correctly, 
is 
summed 
up 
in 
this, 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
regard 
nature 
as 
being 
the 
very 
mechanism 
of 
bodies; 
which 
indeed 
may 
be 
proved 
ως 
εν 
πλατει; 
but 
if 
he 
had 
examined 
the 
thing 
with 
more 
αχριβεια 
he 
would 
have 
distinguished 
in 
the 
mechanism 
itself 
the 
principles 
from 
their 
derivatives. 
So 
it 
does 
not 
suffice, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
a 
clock, 
to 
say 
that 
it 
is 
moved 
in 
a 
mechanical 
manner, 
without 
distinguishing 
whether 
it 
receives 
this 
impulse 
from 
a 
weight 
or 
from 
a 
spring. 
I 
have 
already 
declared 
more 
than 
once 
(what 
I 
think 
will 
be 
of 
profit 
in 
hindering 
the 
abusing 
of 
mechanical 
explanations 
of 
material 
things, 
to 
the 
prejudice 
of 
piety, 
as 
if 
matter 
could 
exist 
of 
itself 
and 
as 
if 
the 
mechanism 
had 
no 
need 
of 
any 
intelligence 
or 
of 
any 
spiritual 
substance) 
that 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
mechanism 
itself 
does 
not 
come 
merely 
from 
a 
material 
principle 
alone 
nor 
from 
mathematical 
reasons 
but 
from 
a 
certain 
higherprinciple,and,sotospeak,metaphysicalsource. 


(4.) 
One 
remarkable 
proof, 
among 
others, 
of 
this 
truth 
is 
that 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
must 
be 
made 
to 
consist 
not 
in 
this, 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
motion 
is 
preserved, 
as 
was 
commonly 
believed, 
but 
rather 
in 
this, 
that 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
active 
power, 
still 
more 
(and 
I 
have 
discovered 
that 
this 
happens 
for 
an 
admirable 
reason), 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
moving 
action 
must 
he 
preserved, 
the 
estimation 
of 
which 
must 
be 
very 
differentfromthatwhich 
the 
Cartesiansconceiveunderquantityofmotion. 


Ihaveconferredonthissubject,partlybyletters,inpartpublicly,withtwo 
mathematicians 
of 
superior 
talent, 
and 
one 
of 
them 
embraced 
my 
opinion 
altogether; 
the 
other, 
after 
long 
and 
thorough 
examination, 
ended 
by 
renouncing 
all 
his 
objections 
and 
avowing 
frankly 
that 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
been 
able 
to 
find 
ananswer 
to 
my 
demonstration. 
And 
I 
amall 
themore 
astonished 
to 
see 
that 
the 
illustrious 
man, 
in 
the 
edited 
portion 
of 
his 
Select 
Physics, 
in 



explaining 
the 
laws 
of 
motion, 
has 
admitted 
the 
common 
doctrine 
as 
if 
it 
did 
not 
permit 
of 
doubt 
(he 
has, 
however, 
recognized 
that 
it 
rests 
upon 
no 
demonstration 
but 
on 
a 
certain 
probability, 
and 
he 
has 
repeated 
it 
in 
this 
last 
dissertation, 
Chap. 
3, 
§ 
2); 
but 
perhaps 
he 
wrote 
before 
my 
writings 
appeared 
and 
had 
not 
the 
time 
or 
the 
thought 
for 
revising 
his 
own, 
especially 
as 
he 
was 
persuadedthatthelaws 
ofmotionarearbitrary, 
whichappearstomenotatall 
according 
to 
reason. 
For 
I 
think 
that 
it 
is 
because 
of 
reasons 
determined 
by 
wisdom 
and 
order 
that 
God 
has 
been 
led 
to 
make 
the 
laws 
which 
we 
observe 
in 
nature; 
and 
hence 
it 
is 
evident, 
according 
to 
the 
remark 
which 
I 
formerly 
made 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
an 
optical 
law 
and 
which 
the 
celebrated 
Molineux 
later 
highly 
approved 
in 
his 
Dioptrics, 
that 
final 
cause 
is 
not 
only 
useful 
to 
virtue 
andto 
piety 
inethicsandinnatural 
theology, 
butthateven 
in 
physicsit 
serves 
to 
find 
and 
to 
discover 
hidden 
truths. 
So 
when 
the 
renowned 
Sturm, 
where 
he 
treats 
of 
final 
cause 
in 
his 
Select 
Physics, 
presented 
my 
doctrine 
among 
the 
hypotheses, 
I 
could 
have 
wished 
that 
he 
had 
sufficiently 
examined 
it 
in 
his 
criticism; 
for 
he 
would 
have 
found 
opportunity 
for 
saying 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
importance 
and 
richness 
of 
the 
argument 
many 
excellent 
things 
and 
such 
asareusefulfor 
piety. 


(5.) 
But 
we 
must 
now 
examine 
what 
he 
says 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
nature 
in 
his 
apologetic 
dissertation, 
and 
what 
seems 
to 
us 
insufficient 
in 
it. 
He 
grants, 
Chap. 
IV, 
§§ 
2, 
3, 
and 
often 
elsewhere, 
that 
the 
movements 
which 
take 
place 
nowaretheresultofthe 
eternal 
lam 
once 
decreed 
by 
God, 
which 
law 
he 
calls 
soon 
after 
volition 
and 
command; 
and 
that 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
a 
new 
command 
from 
God, 
of 
a 
new 
volition, 
and 
still 
less 
of 
a 
new 
effort 
or 
of 
a 
sort 
of 
laborious 
operation 
(§ 
3); 
and 
he 
repels 
as 
an 
unjust 
imputation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
his 
opponent 
the 
thought 
that 
God 
moves 
things 
as 
a 
wood-cutter 
does 
his 
two-edged 
axe, 
or 
as 
a 
miller 
governs 
his 
mill 
by 
retaining 
the 
waters 
or 
by 
turning 
them 
loose 
on 
the 
wheel. 
But 
in 
truth, 
as 
indeed 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 



this 
explanation 
does 
not 
suffice. 
For 
I 
ask 
if 
this 
volition 
or 
this 
command, 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer, 
this 
divine 
law, 
decreed 
originally, 
attributed 
to 
things 
only 
an 
extrinsic 
denomination; 
or 
if, 
in 
forming 
them, 
it 
created 
in 
them 
some 
permanent 
impression, 
or 
as 
Schelhammer, 
remarkable 
as 
well 
for 
his 
judgment 
as 
for 
his 
experience, 
well 
calls 
it, 
an 
indwelling 
lam 
(although 
it 
is 
most 
often 
unknown 
to 
the 
creatures 
in 
whom 
it 
resides), 
whence 
proceed 
all 
actions 
and 
all 
passions. 
The 
first 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
authors 
of 
the 
system 
of 
Occasional 
Causes, 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
very 
ingenious 
Malebranche;thelatterisreceived(andasIbelieverightly)as 
themosttrue. 


(6.) 
And 
in 
truth 
since 
this 
past 
order 
does 
not 
exist 
at 
present, 
it 
can 
produce 
nothing 
now 
unless 
it 
then 
left 
after 
it 
some 
perduring 
effect, 
which 
now 
still 
continues 
and 
operates. 
And 
he 
who 
thinks 
otherwise 
renounces, 
if 
I 
judge 
rightly, 
all 
distinct 
explanation 
of 
things; 
and 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
anything 
is, 
by 
an 
equal 
title, 
the 
result 
of 
anything, 
if 
that 
which 
is 
absent 
in 
space 
and 
time 
can 
without 
intermedium 
operate 
here 
and 
now. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
say 
that 
in 
creating 
things 
in 
the 
beginning 
God 
willed 
that 
they 
should 
observe 
a 
certain 
law 
in 
their 
progress, 
if 
his 
will 
is 
conceived 
to 
have 
been 
so 
inefficacious 
that 
things, 
were 
not 
affected 
by 
it 
and 
no 
lasting 
effect 
was 
produced 
in 
them. 
And 
assuredly 
it 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
divine 
power 
and 
will, 
which 
is 
pure 
and 
absolute, 
that 
God 
should 
will 
and 
nevertheless 
in 
willing 
produce 
or 
change 
nothing; 
that 
he 
is 
always 
acting 
and 
never 
effecting; 
that 
in 
a 
word 
he 
leaves 
no 
work. 
Without 
doubt, 
if 
nothing 
was 
impressed 
on 
creatures 
by 
this 
divine 
word, 
“Let 
the 
earth 
bring 
forth, 
let 
the 
animals 
multiply 
if 
after 
it 
things 
were 
not 
affected 
otherwise 
than 
if 
no 
command 
intervened, 
it 
follows 
(since 
there 
must 
be 
between 
the 
cause 
and 
the 
effect 
a 
certain 
connection, 
either 
immediate 
or 
mediate), 
either 
that 
nothing 
takes 
place 
now 
conformably 
to 
this 
mandate 
or 
that 
this 
mandate 
effecting 
so 
much 
in 
the 
present 
must 
be 
always 
renewed 
in 
the 



future,a 
consequencewhichthelearned 
author,withreason,repels. 
Butif,on 
the 
contrary, 
the 
law 
decreed 
by 
God 
left 
some 
trace 
of 
itself 
impressed 
on 
things; 
if 
things 
were 
so 
formed 
by 
the 
mandate 
as 
to 
render 
them 
fit 
to 
accomplish 
the 
will 
of 
the 
legislator, 
then 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
a 
certain 
efficacy, 
form 
or 
force, 
such 
as 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
call 
by 
the 
name 
of 
nature, 
is 
impressed 
on 
things, 
whence 
proceeds 
the 
series 
of 
phenomena 
accordingtotheprescriptionof 
thefirstcommand. 


(7.) 
But 
this 
indwelling 
force 
may, 
indeed 
be 
conceived 
distinctly 
but 
not 
explainedby 
images;nor, 
certainly, 
oughtit 
tobe 
so 
explainedany 
more 
than 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
soul, 
for 
force 
is 
one 
of 
those 
things 
which 
are 
not 
to 
be 
grasped 
by 
the 
imagination 
but 
by 
the 
understanding. 
Thus, 
when 
the 
author 
of 
the 
apologetic 
dissertation 
(Chap. 
4, 
§ 
6) 
asks 
that 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
indwelling 
law 
operates 
in 
bodies 
ignorant 
of 
this 
law 
be 
explained 
to 
him 
by 
the 
imagination, 
I 
understand 
him 
to 
desire 
to 
have 
an 
explanation 
of 
it 
through 
the 
understanding; 
for 
otherwise, 
it 
might 
be 
believed 
that 
he 
demanded 
that 
sounds 
be 
painted 
and 
colors 
heard. 
Furthermore, 
if 
the 
difficulty 
of 
explaining 
things 
is 
sufficient 
for 
rejecting 
them, 
he 
therefore 
merits 
the 
imputation 
which 
he 
himself 
(Chap. 
1, 
§ 
2) 
repels 
as 
unjust, 
of 
preferring 
to 
decide 
that 
everything 
is 
moved 
merely 
by 
a 
divine 
virtue 
rather 
than 
to 
admit, 
under 
the 
name 
of 
nature, 
something 
the 
nature 
of 
which 
is 
unknown 
to 
him. 
And 
certainly 
even 
Hobbes 
and 
others 
could 
claim 
with 
equal 
right 
that 
all 
things 
are 
corporeal, 
because 
they 
are 
persuaded 
that 
only 
bodies 
can 
be 
explained 
distinctly 
and 
by 
the 
imagination. 
But 
they 
themselves 
are 
justlyrefuted 
bythe 
veryfactthatthere 
is 
in 
things 
a 
power 
of 
acting 
which 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
imageable 
things, 
but 
merely 
to 
trace 
this 
to 
a 
mandate 
of 
God, 
which 
once 
given, 
in 
no 
wise 
affects 
things 
nor 
leaves 
any 
effect 
after 
it, 
so 
far 
from 
clearing 
up 
the 
difficulty, 
is 
rather 
to 
renounce 
the 
rôle 
of 
the 
philosopher 
and 
to 
cut 
the 
Gordian 
knot 
with 
the 
sword. 
For 
the 



rest, 
a 
more 
distinct 
and 
correct 
explanation 
of 
active 
force 
than 
has 
up 
to 
this 
time 
been 
given, 
may 
be 
drawn 
from 
our 
Dynamics, 
in 
which 
we 
give 
an 
interpretation 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
and 
of 
motion, 
which 
is 
true 
and 
in 
accordancewiththings. 


(8.) 
But 
if 
some 
defender 
of 
the 
new 
philosophy 
which 
introduces 
the 
inertia 
and 
torpor 
of 
things, 
goes 
so 
far 
as 
to 
take 
away 
from 
the 
commands 
of 
God 
all 
durable 
effectand 
all 
efficacy 
for 
the 
future, 
and 
has 
no 
scruples 
in 
requiring 
of 
God 
incessantly 
renewed 
efforts 
(that 
which 
Sturm 
prudently 
declares 
he 
is 
averse 
to), 
he 
himself 
may 
see 
how 
worthy 
he 
thinks 
this 
of 
God; 
moreover, 
he 
could 
not 
be 
excused 
unless 
he 
offered 
an 
explanation 
of 
why 
things 
themselves 
can 
last 
some 
time 
but 
the 
attributes 
of 
things 
which 
we 
understand 
under 
the 
name 
of 
nature 
cannot 
be 
lasting; 
why 
it 
may 
not 
be, 
furthermore, 
according 
to 
reason 
that 
just 
as 
the 
word 
fiat 
left 
something 
after 
it, 
namely, 
the 
persisting 
thing 
itself, 
so 
the 
not 
less 
admirable 
word 
of 
blessing 
has 
left 
also 
after 
it 
in 
things 
a 
certain 
fecundity 
or 
virtue 
of 
producing 
their 
acts 
and 
of 
operating, 
whence, 
if 
there 
is 
no 
obstacle, 
the 
operation 
results. 
That 
which 
I 
have 
explained 
elsewhere 
might 
be 
added 
to 
this 
if 
perchance 
it 
is 
not 
yet 
perfectly 
clear 
to 
all, 
that 
the 
very 
substance 
of 
things 
consists 
in 
their 
power 
of 
acting 
and 
suffering, 
whence 
it 
follows 
that 
noteven 
durablethings 
can 
beproduced 
if 
aforceofsome 
duration 
cannot 
be 
imprinted 
upon 
them 
by 
the 
divine 
power. 
Thus 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
no 
created 
substance, 
no 
soul, 
would 
remain 
numerically 
the 
same; 
that 
nothing 
would 
be 
preserved 
by 
God, 
and 
consequently 
that 
all 
things 
would 
be 
only 
certain 
passing 
or 
evanescent 
modifications, 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
phantasms, 
of 
one 
permanent 
divine 
substance; 
and, 
what 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
thing, 
that 
nature 
itself 
or 
the 
substance 
of 
all 
things, 
would 
be 
God; 
a 
pernicious 
doctrine, 
recently 
introduced 
into 
the 
world 
or 
renewed 
by 
a 
subtle 
but 
profane 
author. 
In 
truth, 
if 
corporeal 
things 
contained 
nothing 
but 
matter 
it 



would 
be 
quite 
true 
to 
say 
that 
they 
are 
in 
a 
flux 
and 
have 
nothing 
substantial, 
asthePlatonistsformerly 
verywellrecognized. 


(9). 
Another 
question 
is 
whether 
we 
must 
say 
that 
creatures 
properly 
and 
truly 
act. 
This 
question 
is 
included 
in 
the 
first 
if 
we 
once 
understand 
that 
the 
indwelling 
nature 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
the 
power 
of 
acting 
and 
suffering. 
For 
there 
cannot 
be 
action 
without 
the 
power 
of 
acting, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
that 
potency 
is 
worthless 
which 
can 
never 
be 
exercised. 
Since, 
however, 
action 
and 
potency 
are 
none 
the 
less 
different 
things, 
the 
first 
successive, 
the 
second 
lasting, 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
action. 
Here, 
I 
confess, 
I 
find 
no 
little 
difficulty 
in 
explaining 
the 
thought 
of 
the 
learned 
Sturm. 
For 
he 
denies 
that 
created 
things 
act 
properly 
and 
of 
themselves, 
and, 
nevertheless, 
soon 
after, 
while 
admitting 
that 
they 
act, 
he 
does 
not 
wish 
that 
the 
comparison 
of 
creatures 
to 
an 
ax 
moved 
by 
a 
wood-cutter 
be 
attributed 
to 
him. 
I 
cannot 
draw 
from 
this 
anything 
certain 
nor 
do 
I 
find 
explained 
with 
sufficient 
clearness 
to 
what 
extent 
he 
recedes 
from 
the 
received 
opinions, 
or 
what 
distinct 
notion 
he 
has 
conceived 
in 
his 
mind 
of 
action, 
which, 
as 
the 
debates 
of 
the 
metaphysicians 
attest, 
is 
far 
from 
being 
obvious 
and 
simple. 
As 
for 
me, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
seem 
to 
have 
grasped 
the 
notion 
of 
action, 
the 
doctrine 
generally 
received 
in 
philosophy, 
that 
actions 
belong 
to 
subjects, 
follows 
from 
it 
and 
is 
established 
by 
it; 
and 
I 
think 
that 
this 
principle 
is 
so 
true 
that 
it 
may 
be 
inverted; 
so 
that 
not 
only 
is 
everything 
which 
acts 
a 
particular 
substance, 
but 
also 
every 
particular 
substance 
acts 
without 
cessation, 
not 
even 
excepting 
body 
itself, 
in 
which 
noabsolute 
restis 
everfound. 


(10). 
But 
let 
us 
now 
examine 
a 
little 
more 
attentively 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
take 
away 
from 
created 
things 
true 
and 
individual 
action; 
a 
thing 
which 
Robert 
Fludd, 
author 
of 
the 
Philosophia 
Mosaica, 
formerly 
did, 
and 
also 
now 
some 
Cartesians 
do 
who 
think 
that 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
the 
things 
which 
act, 
but 
indeed 
God, 
on 
occasion 
of 
things 
and 
according 
to 
the 
aptitude 
of 
things; 



and 
thus 
things 
are 
occasions 
not 
causes; 
they 
receive, 
but 
do 
not 
effect 
or 
produce. 
After 
Cordemoi, 
de 
La 
Forgeand 
other 
Cartesianshad 
proposed 
this 
doctrine, 
Malebranche, 
with 
his 
superior 
mind, 
lent 
it 
the 
lustre 
of 
his 
style; 
but 
no 
one, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
has 
presented 
solid 
proofs. 
Certainly 
if 
this 
doctrine 
is 
pushed 
to 
the 
point 
of 
suppressing 
even 
the 
immanent 
actions 
of 
substances 
(a 
view 
which 
the 
illustrious 
Sturm 
in 
his 
Select 
Physics, 
Bk. 
I, 
ch. 
iv, 
Epilo. 
§11, 
p. 
176, 
rightly 
rejects, 
and 
in 
this 
he 
gives 
proof 
of 
much 
circumspection), 
then 
nothing 
in 
the 
world 
appears 
to 
be 
more 
contrary 
to 
reason. 
In 
truth, 
who 
will 
question 
that 
the 
mind 
thinks 
and 
wills, 
and 
that 
many 
thoughts 
and 
volitions 
in 
us 
are 
elicited 
from! 
ourselves, 
and 
that 
we 
are 
endowed 
with 
spontaneity? 
This 
would 
be 
not 
only 
to 
deny 
human 
liberty 
andtomakeGodthecauseofevil,but 
alsotocontradictthetestimonyofour 
inmost 
experience 
and 
of 
our 
conscience; 
through 
which 
we 
feel 
that 
those 
things 
are 
ours, 
which, 
without 
any 
kind 
of 
reason, 
our 
adversaries 
would 
transfer 
to 
God. 
But 
if 
we 
attribute 
to 
our 
soul 
the 
indwelling 
power 
of 
producing 
immanent 
actions, 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
of 
acting 
immanently, 
then 
nothing 
hinders, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
conformable 
to 
reason, 
that 
this 
same 
power 
should 
reside 
in 
other 
animated 
beings 
or 
forms, 
or, 
if 
you 
prefer,in 
thenatureof 
substances; 
butif 
some 
one 
should 
think 
that 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
as 
known 
to 
us 
only 
our 
souls 
are 
active, 
or 
that 
all 
power 
of 
acting 
immanently, 
and 
so 
to 
speak 
vitally, 
is 
joined 
with 
intellect, 
such 
assertions 
certainly 
rest 
on 
no 
ground, 
and 
can 
be 
defended 
only 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
truth. 
As 
to 
what 
is 
to 
be 
believed 
concerning 
the 
transient 
actions 
of 
creatures, 
that 
will 
be 
explained 
better 
in 
another 
place, 
and 
has, 
in 
part, 
already 
been 
explained 
by 
us 
elsewhere: 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
communication 
of 
substances 
or 
of 
monads 
has 
its 
source 
not 
in 
influx 
but 
in 
a 
concord 
proceeding 
from 
divine 
preformation; 
each 
substance, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
it 
follows 
the 
indwelling 
power 
and 
laws 
of 
its 
own 
nature, 
being 



accommodated 
to 
the 
others; 
and 
it 
is 
in 
this 
that 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
bodyconsists. 


(11). 
Moreover, 
that 
bodies 
are 
of 
themselves 
inert 
is 
true 
if 
it 
is 
rightly 
understood, 
that 
is, 
that 
what 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
in 
some 
way 
at 
rest 
cannot 
set 
itself 
in 
motion 
or 
allow 
itself 
without 
resistance 
to 
be 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
another 
body; 
any 
more 
than 
it 
can 
of 
itself 
change 
the 
rate 
of 
velocity 
or 
the 
direction 
which 
it 
once 
has, 
or 
allow 
it 
easily 
and 
without 
resistance 
to 
be 
changed 
by 
another 
body. 
And 
thus 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
extension, 
or 
what 
is 
geometrical 
in 
body 
if 
taken 
simply, 
has 
nothing 
in 
it 
which 
can 
give 
rise 
to 
action 
and 
to 
movement; 
on 
the 
contrary, 
matter 
rather 
resists 
motion 
by 
a 
certain 
natural 
inertia, 
as 
Kepler 
has 
well 
called 
it, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
not 
indifferent 
to 
motion 
and 
rest, 
as 
is 
generally 
thought, 
but 
it 
needs 
in 
order 
to 
move 
an 
active 
force 
proportionate 
to 
its 
size. 
Wherefore 
I 
make 
the 
very 
notion 
of 
materia 
prima, 
or 
of 
mass, 
consist 
in 
this 
very 
passive 
force 
of 
resistance 
(involving 
impenetrability 
and 
something 
more), 
which 
is 
always 
the 
same 
in 
body 
and 
proportioned 
to 
its 
size; 
and 
hence, 
I 
show 
that 
entirely 
different 
laws 
of 
motion 
follow 
than 
if 
there 
were 
in 
body 
and 
in 
matter 
itself 
only 
impenetrability 
together 
with 
extension; 
and 
that, 
as 
there 
is 
in 
matter 
a 
natural 
inertia 
opposed 
to 
motion, 
so 
in 
body 
itself, 
and 
what 
is 
more, 
in 
every 
substance, 
there 
is 
a 
natural 
constancy 
opposed 
to 
change. 
But 
this 
doctrine 
is 
not 
defended, 
but 
rather 
opposed, 
by 
those 
who 
deny 
action 
to 
things; 
forjustas 
certainasitis 
thatmatter 
ofitself 
does 
not 
beginmotion, 
so 
certain 
is 
it 
(as 
very 
fine 
experiments 
on 
the 
motion 
communicated 
by 
a 
moving 
body 
show) 
that 
body 
retains 
of 
itself 
the 
impetus 
which 
it 
has 
once 
acquired, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
stable 
in 
its 
levity 
or 
makes 
an 
effort 
to 
persevere 
in 
that 
very 
series 
of 
changes 
which 
it 
has 
entered 
on. 
As 
these 
activities, 
or 
entelechies, 
cannot 
be 
modifications 
of 
primary 
matter 
or 
of 
mass, 
a 
thing 
essentially 
passive, 
as 
was 
recognized 
by 
the 
very 
judicious 
Sturm 
himself 



(as 
we 
shall 
see 
in 
the 
following 
paragraph), 
it 
may 
be 
inferred 
that 
there 
must 
be 
found 
in 
corporeal 
substance 
a 
first 
entelechy 
for 
activity; 
that 
is, 
a 
primitive 
motor 
force 
which 
being 
joined 
to 
extension 
(or 
what 
is 
purely 
geometrical) 
and 
to 
mass 
(or 
what 
is 
purely 
material) 
always 
indeed 
acts 
but 
nevertheless, 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
meeting 
of 
bodies, 
is 
variously 
modified 
through 
effort 
and 
impetus. 
And 
it 
is 
this 
same 
substantial 
principle 
which 
is 
called 
soul 
in 
living 
beings, 
andsubstantialform 
in 
others;andso 
far 
asby 
its 
union 
with 
matter 
it 
constitutes 
a 
substance 
truly 
one, 
or 
one 
per 
se, 
it 
forms 
what 
I 
call 
a 
monad: 
since 
if 
these 
true 
and 
real 
unities 
are 
taken 
away 
only 
beings 
by 
aggregation 
will 
remain; 
nay, 
rather, 
it 
follows 
from 
this, 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
real 
entities 
in 
bodies. 
For 
although 
there 
are 
atoms 
of 
substance 
given, 
that 
is, 
our 
monads 
without 
parts, 
there 
are 
no 
atoms 
of 
mass, 
i. 
e. 
of 
the 
smallest 
extension, 
or 
ultimate 
elements, 
since 
the 
continuous 
cannot 
be 
formed 
of 
points. 
In 
short, 
no 
being 
is 
given 
which 
is 
the 
greatest 
in 
mass 
or 
infinite 
in 
extension, 
although 
there 
may 
always 
be 
some 
larger 
than 
others: 
but 
a 
being 
is 
given 
which 
is 
the 
greatest 
by 
intension 
of 
perfections 
or 
infiniteinpower. 


(12). 
I 
see 
however 
that 
in 
this 
same 
apolegetic 
dissertation, 
ch. 
IV, 
§ 
7 
et 
seq. 
the 
celebrated 
Sturm 
has 
undertaken 
to 
attack 
by 
certain 
arguments 
the 
motor 
force 
residing 
in 
bodies. 
“I 
shall 
abundantly 
here 
prove,” 
he 
says, 
“that 
corporeal 
substance 
is 
not 
even 
capable 
of 
any 
actively 
motor 
potency.” 
But 
I 
do 
not 
understand 
what 
a 
power 
not 
actively 
motor 
can 
be. 
Moreover, 
he 
says 
that 
he 
will 
employ 
two 
arguments, 
one 
drawn 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
matter 
and 
of 
body, 
the 
other 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
motion. 
The 
first 
amounts 
to 
this, 
that 
matter, 
in 
its 
nature 
and 
essentially, 
is 
a 
passive 
substance; 
and 
that 
thus 
it 
is 
no 
more 
possible 
to 
give 
it 
active 
force 
than 
it 
is 
for 
God 
to 
will 
that 
a 
stone, 
as 
long 
as 
it 
remains 
a 
stone, 
shall 
be 
living 
and 
rational, 
that 
is, 
not 
a 
stone; 
further, 
whatever 
qualities 
are 
posited 
in 
bodies 
are 
but 
modifications 
of 



matter, 
moreover 
(what 
I 
acknowledge 
is 
well 
said), 
a 
modification 
of 
a 
thing 
essentially 
passive 
cannot 
render 
this 
thing 
active. 
But 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
reply 
with 
the 
received 
and 
true 
philosophy 
that 
matter 
is 
to 
be 
understood 
as 
secondary 
or 
as 
primary; 
the 
secondary 
is 
a 
certain 
complete 
but 
not 
purely 
passive 
substance; 
the 
primary 
is 
purely 
passive 
but 
not 
complete, 
and 
consequently 
there 
must 
be 
added 
to 
it 
a 
soul, 
or 
form 
analogous 
to 
the 
soul, 
a 
primary 
entelexeia, 
that 
is, 
a 
certain 
effort 
or 
primitive 
power 
of 
acting, 
which 
is 
itself 
the 
indwelling 
law 
imprinted 
by 
divine 
decree. 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
such 
a 
view 
is 
repugnant 
to 
the 
illustrious 
and 
ingenious 
man 
who 
lately 
maintained 
that 
body 
is 
composed 
of 
matter 
and 
of 
spirit; 
provided 
that 
spirit 
is 
taken 
not 
for 
an 
intelligent 
thing 
(as 
in 
other 
cases 
is 
done) 
but 
for 
a 
soul 
or 
form 
analogous 
to 
the 
soul; 
not 
for 
a 
simple 
modification, 
but 
for 
something 
constituent, 
substantial 
and 
perduring, 
which 
I 
am 
accustomed 
to 
call 
monad, 
and 
which 
possesses 
a 
sort 
of 
perception 
and 
desire. 
Therefore 
this 
received 
doctrine, 
agreeing 
with 
the 
favorably 
explained 
dogma 
of 
the 
schoolmen, 
must 
be 
first 
refuted, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
argument 
of 
this 
illustrious 
man 
may 
have 
any 
weight. 
Whence 
also 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
we 
cannot 
admit, 
what 
he 
assumes, 
that 
whatever 
is 
in 
corporeal 
substance 
is 
but 
a 
modification 
of 
matter. 
For 
itiswell 
known 
that 
according 
toreceivedphilosophy 
there 
arein 
the 
bodies 
of 
living 
beings 
souls 
which 
assuredly 
are 
not 
modifications. 
For 
although 
the 
illustrious 
man 
appears 
to 
maintain 
the 
contrary 
and 
to 
take 
away 
from 
the 
brutes 
all 
feeling, 
in 
the 
true 
meaning 
of 
the 
word, 
and 
soul, 
properly 
speaking, 
nevertheless, 
he 
cannot 
assume 
this 
opinion 
as 
the 
foundation 
of 
his 
demonstration 
until 
it 
itself 
has 
been 
proved. 
And 
I 
believe, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
it 
is 
consistent 
neither 
with 
the 
order 
nor 
the 
beauty 
nor 
the 
reason 
of 
things, 
that 
this 
vital 
or 
immanently 
active 
principle 
should 
be 
only 
in 
a 
small 
part 
of 
matter, 
when 
greater 
perfection 
demands 
that 
it 
he 
in 
all. 
Nor 
does 
aught 
hinder 
souls, 
or 
at 
least 
forms 
analogous 
to 
souls, 
from 



being 
everywhere, 
although 
the 
dominant, 
and 
hence 
intelligent, 
souls, 
like 
thehuman, 
cannotbeeverywhere. 


(13). 
The 
second 
argument, 
which 
the 
illustrious 
Sturm 
draws 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
motion, 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
me 
to 
be 
necessarily 
conclusive. 
He 
says 
that 
motion 
is 
only 
the 
successive 
existence 
of 
the 
thing 
in 
different 
places. 
Let 
us 
grant 
this 
provisionally, 
although 
we 
are 
not 
at 
all 
satisfied 
with 
it, 
and 
although 
it 
expresses 
rather 
the 
result 
of 
motion 
that 
its 
so-called 
formal 
reason; 
nevertheless 
motor 
force 
is 
not 
thus 
excluded. 
For 
a 
body 
is 
not 
only 
at 
the 
actual 
moment 
of 
its 
motion 
in 
the 
place 
assigned 
it, 
but 
it 
has 
also 
a 
tendency 
or 
effort 
to 
change 
its 
place 
so 
that 
the 
succeeding 
state 
follows 
of 
itself 
from 
the 
present 
by 
the 
force 
of 
nature; 
otherwise 
at 
the 
actual 
moment, 
and 
hence 
at 
any 
moment, 
body 
A, 
which 
is 
moved 
by 
body 
B, 
would 
in 
no 
wise 
differ 
from 
a 
body 
at 
rest; 
and 
from 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
illustrious 
man, 
were 
it 
contrary 
to 
ours 
on 
this 
point, 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
there 
would 
be 
no 
difference 
whatever 
in 
bodies, 
because 
in 
the 
fullness 
of 
a 
mass 
in 
itself 
uniform 
no 
other 
difference 
can 
be 
assumed 
than 
that 
which 
respects 
the 
motion. 
Finally, 
it 
would 
further 
follow 
that 
there 
would 
be 
absolutely 
no 
variation 
in 
bodies, 
and 
that 
they 
would 
remain 
always 
in 
the 
same 
state. 
For 
if 
any 
portion 
of 
matter 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
another 
equal 
to 
and 
like 
it 
(which 
the 
illustrious 
Sturm 
must 
admit, 
since 
he 
does 
away 
with 
active 
forces,impulses, 
andallotherqualitiesandmodifications,exceptexistencein 
this 
place, 
which 
would 
he 
successivelyanother 
and 
another); 
if 
moreover 
the 
state 
at 
one 
instant 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
the 
state 
at 
another 
instant 
except 
by 
the 
transposition 
of 
portions 
of 
matter, 
equal 
and 
similar, 
and 
at 
every 
point 
fitting 
to 
each 
other, 
it 
evidently 
follows 
that, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
perpetual 
substitution 
of 
indiscernible 
things, 
it 
will 
be 
absolutely 
impossible 
to 
distinguish 
the 
states 
in 
the 
world 
of 
bodies 
at 
different 
moments. 
In 
truth, 
it 
would 
only 
he 
an 
extrinsic 
denomination 
by 
which 
one 
part 
of 
matter 
would 



be 
distinguished 
from 
another, 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
future, 
namely, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
later 
in 
another 
and 
still 
another 
place; 
but 
for 
the 
present 
state, 
there 
is 
no 
difference; 
and 
not 
even 
from 
the 
future 
could 
a 
well 
founded 
difference 
he 
drawn, 
because 
we 
could 
even 
later 
never 
arrive 
at 
any 
true 
present 
difference, 
since 
by 
no 
mark 
can 
one 
place 
be 
distinguished 
from 
another 
place, 
nor 
(on 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
perfect 
uniformity 
in 
matter 
itself) 
matter 
from 
other 
matter 
of 
the 
same 
place. 
In 
vain 
also 
would 
we 
after 
motion 
have 
resort 
to 
figure. 
In 
a 
mass 
perfectly 
similar, 
indistinguishable 
and 
full, 
there 
arises 
no 
figure, 
nor 
limit 
and 
distinction 
of 
various 
parts, 
except 
from 
the 
motion 
itself. 
If 
then 
motion 
does 
not 
contain 
any 
mark 
of 
distinction 
it 
will 
impart 
none 
to 
figure; 
and 
as 
everything 
which 
is 
substituted 
for 
that 
which 
was,isperfectly 
equivalent, 
noone, 
even 
were 
he 
omniscient, 
couldgrasp 
the 
least 
indication 
of 
change, 
and 
consequently 
everything 
will 
be 
just 
as 
if 
no 
change 
and 
no 
distinction 
occurred 
in 
bodies: 
and 
we 
could 
never 
in 
this 
way 
account 
for 
the 
diverse 
appearances 
which 
we 
perceive. 
And 
it 
would 
be 
as 
if 
we 
should 
imagine 
two 
perfect 
concentric 
spheres, 
perfectly 
similar 
in 
themselves 
and 
in 
all 
their 
parts, 
one 
of 
which 
should 
be 
enclosed 
in 
the 
other 
so 
that 
not 
the 
least 
aperture 
should 
be 
left: 
then, 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
the 
inner 
sphere 
is 
either 
in 
motion 
or 
at 
rest, 
not 
even 
an 
angel, 
to 
say 
nothing 
more, 
will 
be 
able 
to 
perceive 
any 
difference 
between 
the 
states 
at 
different 
times, 
and 
will 
have 
no 
sign 
by 
which 
to 
distinguish 
whether 
the 
inner 
sphere 
is 
at 
rest 
or 
in 
motion 
and 
according 
to 
what 
law 
the 
motion 
is. 
Moreover, 
not 
even 
the 
boundary 
of 
the 
spheres 
can 
be 
defined, 
because 
of 
the 
want 
both 
of 
aperture 
and 
of 
difference; 
just 
as 
in 
this 
case 
motion 
cannot 
be 
noticed 
because 
of 
the 
one 
lack 
of 
difference. 
Whence 
it 
must 
be 
considered 
as 
certain 
(although 
those 
who 
have 
not 
sufficiently 
penetrated 
into 
these 
things 
have 
little 
noticed 
it) 
that 
such 
things 
are 
foreign 
to 
the 
nature 
and 
order 
of 
things, 
and 
that 
(what 
is 
among 
the 
number 
of 
my 
new 
and 
greater 
axioms) 



thereis 
nowhere 
any 
perfect 
similarity; 
whence 
it 
follows 
also 
that 
we 
find 
in 
nature 
neither 
corpuscles 
of 
an 
extreme 
hardness, 
nor 
a 
fluid 
of 
an 
extreme 
tenuity, 
nor 
subtile 
matter 
universally 
diffused, 
nor 
ultimate 
elements, 
called 
by 
some 
by 
the 
name 
of 
primary 
or 
secondary. 
It 
is, 
I 
believe, 
because 
he 
had 
understood 
something 
of 
this, 
that 
Aristotle, 
more 
profound 
in 
my 
opinion 
than 
many 
think, 
judged 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
local 
change 
there 
was 
need 
of 
alteration, 
and 
that 
matter 
would 
remain 
invariable. 
Moreover, 
this 
dissimilarity 
or 
diversity 
of 
qualities, 
and 
hence 
this 
alloiosis 
or 
alteration, 
which 
Aristotle 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
explain, 
comes 
from 
the 
diverse 
degrees 
and 
directions 
of 
efforts, 
and 
so 
from 
the 
modifications 
of 
indwelling 
monads. 
We 
can 
understand 
by 
this 
that 
there 
must 
necessarily 
he 
posited 
in 
bodies 
something 
besides 
a 
uniform 
mass 
and 
its 
not 
untimely 
transportation. 
Certainly, 
those 
who 
hold 
to 
atoms 
and 
a 
vacuum 
diversify 
matter 
at 
least 
in 
some 
degree 
by 
making 
it 
here 
divisible, 
there 
indivisible, 
full 
in 
one 
place, 
porous 
in 
another. 
But 
for 
a 
long 
time 
now 
I 
have 
understood 
(by 
laying 
aside 
the 
prejudices 
of 
youth) 
that 
atoms 
together 
with 
vacuum 
must 
be 
rejected. 
The 
celebrated 
author 
adds 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
matter 
through 
diverse 
moments 
is 
to 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
divine 
will; 
why 
not 
then, 
he 
says, 
attribute 
to 
the 
same 
its 
existence 
here 
and 
now? 
I 
reply, 
that 
this, 
like 
all 
other 
things 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
involve 
some 
perfection, 
must 
undoubtedly 
be 
attributed 
to 
God; 
but 
just 
as 
this 
universal 
first 
cause 
which 
preserves 
all 
things 
does 
not 
destroy, 
but 
rather 
produces, 
the 
natural 
permanence, 
or 
once 
granted 
perseverance 
in 
existence, 
of 
the 
thing 
which 
begins 
to 
exist; 
so 
it 
will 
not 
destroy 
but 
rather 
strengthen 
the 
natural 
efficacy, 
or 
perseverance 
in 
action 
oncecommunicated,of 
thething 
set 
inmotion. 


(14) 
—. 
Many 
other 
things 
are 
met 
with 
in 
this 
apologetic 
dissertation 
which 
present 
difficulties, 
as 
what 
is 
said 
chapter 
IV, 
§11, 
concerning 
motion 
transmitted 
from 
one 
ball 
to 
another 
through 
several 
intermediaries, 
that 
the 

last 
ball 
is 
moved 
by 
the 
same 
force 
by 
which 
the 
first 
is 
moved, 
whereas, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
it 
is 
moved 
by 
an 
equivalent 
but 
not 
the 
same 
force; 
for 
(what 
may 
appear 
surprising), 
each 
ball 
repelled 
by 
the 
next 
impinging 
it 
is 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
its 
own 
force, 
viz. 
its 
elasticity. 
(I 
do 
not 
here 
discuss 
at 
all 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
elasticity, 
nor 
do 
I 
deny 
that 
it 
ought 
to 
be 
explained 
mechanically 
by 
the 
movement 
of 
an 
indwelling 
and 
unstable 
fluid). 
So 
also 
it 
will 
rightly 
seem 
surprising 
when 
he 
says, 
§ 
12, 
that 
a 
thing 
which 
cannot 
set 
itself 
in 
motion 
cannot 
of 
itself 
continue 
the 
motion. 
For 
it 
is 
evident 
rather 
that, 
as 
there 
is 
need 
of 
force 
to 
communicate 
motion, 
so, 
when 
the 
impulse 
is 
once 
given, 
so 
far 
from 
there 
being 
need 
of 
a 
new 
force 
to 
continue 
it 
there 
is 
rather 
need 
of 
a 
new 
force 
to 
stop 
it. 
For 
the 
question 
here 
is 
not 
of 
that 
preservation 
of 
motion 
by 
means 
of 
a 
universal 
cause 
necessary 
to 
things, 
which, 
as 
we 
have 
remarked, 
could 
not 
destroy 
the 
efficiency 
of 
things 
withouttakingawaytheirexistence. 


(15) 
—. 
By 
this 
it 
will 
be 
again 
perceived 
that 
the 
doctrine 
of 
occasional 
causes 
defended 
by 
some 
(unless 
it 
be 
explained 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
admit 
of 
modifications 
which, 
the 
illustrious 
Sturm 
has 
in 
part 
admitted 
and 
in 
part 
seems 
disposed 
to 
admit), 
is 
subject 
to 
dangerous 
consequences 
which 
are 
certainly 
not 
agreeable 
to 
its 
very 
learned 
defenders. 
For 
so 
far 
is 
it 
from 
augmenting 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
by 
doing 
away 
with 
the 
idola 
of 
nature, 
that 
on 
the 
contrary, 
by 
resolving 
all 
created 
things 
into 
simple 
modifications 
of 
a 
single 
divine 
substance, 
it 
seems, 
with 
Spinoza, 
to 
make 
of 
God 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
things; 
since 
that 
which 
does 
not 
act, 
that 
which 
lacks 
active 
force, 
that 
which 
is 
deprived 
of 
distinctive 
mark, 
and 
finally, 
of 
all 
reason 
and 
ground 
of 
permanence, 
can 
in 
no 
wise 
be 
a 
substance. 
I 
am 
thoroughly 
persuaded 
that 
the 
illustrious 
Sturm, 
a 
man 
remarkable 
for 
his 
piety 
and 
learning, 
is 
very 
far 
removed 
from 
these 
monstrosities. 
Thus 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
but 
that 
he 
will 
either 
have 
to 
show 
clearly 
that 
there 
remains 
in 
things 
some 

substance 
or 
even 
some 
variation, 
without 
prejudice 
to 
his 
doctrine, 
or 
he 
will 
haveto 
acceptthetruth. 


(16). 
I 
have 
many 
reasons 
to 
suspect 
that 
I 
have 
not 
sufficiently 
grasped 
his 
meaning, 
nor 
he 
mine. 
He 
has 
somewhere 
admitted 
to 
me 
that 
a 
certain 
portion 
of 
divine 
power 
(that 
is, 
as 
I 
think, 
an 
expression, 
imitation, 
nearest 
effect; 
for 
the 
divine 
force 
itself 
can 
certainly 
not 
be 
divided 
into 
parts) 
can 
and 
even 
in 
a 
way 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
possessed 
by 
and 
attributed 
to 
things. 
Whathehastransmittedto 
meandwhathe 
hasrepeatedinhisSelectPhysics, 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
passage 
which 
I 
quoted 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
essay. 
If 
this 
be 
interpreted 
(as 
the 
terms 
seem 
to 
imply) 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
we 
speak 
of 
the 
soul 
as 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
divine 
breath, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
controversy 
between 
us. 
But 
what 
prevents 
me 
from 
affirming 
that 
such 
is 
his 
meaning, 
is 
that 
nowhere 
else 
do 
I 
see 
him 
propounding 
anything 
like 
it, 
nor 
advancing 
any 
deductions 
from 
it. 
I 
notice 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
his 
general 
views 
are 
little 
in 
harmony 
with 
this 
opinion, 
and 
that 
his 
apologetic 
dissertation 
goes 
into 
everything 
else. 
When 
indeed 
my 
views 
concerning 
indwelling 
force 
were 
first 
published 
in 
the 
month 
of 
March, 
1694, 
in 
the 
Acta 
Eruditorum 
of 
Leipzig 
(views 
which 
my 
Essay 
on 
Dynamics 
published 
in 
the 
same 
in 
April, 
1695, 
farther 
developed), 
he 
addressed 
to 
me 
by 
letter 
certain 
objection’s; 
but 
after 
having 
received 
my 
reply, 
he 
decided 
in 
a 
very 
friendly 
way 
that 
the 
only 
difference 
between 
us 
was 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
expressing 
ourselves. 
When 
I, 
remarking 
this, 
had 
brought 
some 
other 
things 
to 
his 
attention, 
he 
turning 
about 
declared 
there 
were 
many 
differences 
between 
us, 
which 
I 
recognized: 
and 
finally, 
these 
having 
been 
removed, 
he 
wrote 
me 
anew 
that 
there 
was 
no 
difference 
between 
us 
except 
in 
terms, 
a 
thing 
very 
agreeable 
to 
me. 
I 
have, 
therefore, 
wished, 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
recent 
apologetic 
dissertation, 
to 
so 
explain 
the 
matter 
that 
finally 
the 
opinion 
of 
each 
one 
of 
us 
and 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
same 
may 
the 
more 
easily 
be 



established. 
For 
the 
illustrious 
author 
possesses, 
moreover, 
such 
rare 
penetration 
and 
clearness 
of 
exposition, 
that 
I 
hope 
that 
no 
little 
light 
will 
be 
thrown 
by 
his 
zeal 
on 
this 
great 
subject. 
And 
consequently 
this 
work 
of 
mine 
will 
not 
be 
useless 
because 
it 
furnishes 
him 
the 
opportunity, 
with 
his 
wonted 
talent 
and 
force 
of 
judgment, 
to 
examine 
and 
to 
explain 
some 
things 
of 
importance 
in 
the 
present 
subject, 
which 
have 
up 
to 
this 
time 
been 
omitted 
by 
authors 
and 
by 
me. 
But 
these 
things 
will 
be 
supplemented, 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
by 
new, 
more 
profound, 
and 
more 
comprehensive 
principles, 
whence 
perhaps 
may 
come, 
some 
day, 
a 
reconstructed 
and 
amended 
system 
of 
philosophy 
midway 
between 
the 
formal 
and 
the 
material 
(and 
properly 
unitingandpreserving 
both). 



ETHICAL 
DEFINITIONS. 
1697-1698. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



AS 
TO 
CHARITY 
or 
disinterested 
‘love, 
on 
which 
I 
see 
embarrassing 
disputes 
have 
arisen, 
I 
think 
that 
one 
could 
not 
extricate 
one’s 
self 
better 
than 
by 
giving 
a 
true 
definition 
of 
love. 
I 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
preface 
to 
the 
work 
[Codex 
Diplomaticus 
Juris 
Gentium] 
which 
is 
known 
to 
you, 
sir, 
I 
have 
formerly 
so 
done 
in 
noting 
the 
source 
of 
justice. 
For 
JUSTICE 
is 
fundamentally 
nothing 
else 
than 
charity 
conformed 
to 
wisdom. 
CHARITY 
is 
universal 
benevolence. 
BENEVOLENCE 
is 
a 
disposition 
or 
inclination 
to 
love 
and 
it 
has 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
love 
that 
habit 
has 
to 
act. 
And 
LOVE 
is 
this 
act 
or 
active 
state 
of 
the 
soul 
which 
makes 
us 
find 
our 
pleasure 
in 
the 
happiness 
or 
satisfaction 
of 
others. 
This 
definition, 
as 
I 
have 
since 
noted, 
is 
capable 
of 
solving 
the 
enigma 
of 
disinterested 
love, 
and 
of 
distinguishing 
it 
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
interest 
or 
debauchery. 
I 
remember 
that 
in 
a 
conversation, 
which 
I 
had 
several 
years 
ago 
with 
the 
Count 
— 
and 
other 
friends, 
in 
which 
human 
love 
alone 
was 
spoken 
of, 
thisdifficulty 
was 
agitated, 
and 
mysolution 
was 
found 
satisfactory. 
When 
one 
loves 
a 
person 
sincerely 
one 
does 
not 
seek 
one’s 
own 
advantage 
or 
a 
pleasure 
severed 
from 
that 
of 
the 
beloved 
person, 
but 
one 
seeks 
one’s 
pleasure 
in 
the 
contentment 
and 
in 
the 
felicity 
of 
this 
person. 
And 
if 
this 
felicity 
did 
not 
please 
in 
itself, 
but 
merely 
because 
of 
an 
advantage 
resulting 
therefrom 
to 
us, 
this 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
pure 
and 
sincere 
love. 
It 
must 
be 
then 
that 
pleasure 
is 
immediately, 
found 
in 
this 
felicity, 
and 
that 
grief 
is 
found 
in 
the 
unhappiness 
of 
the 
beloved 
person. 
For 
whatever 
produces 
pleasure 
immediately 
through 
itself 
is 
also 
desired 
for 
itself, 
as 



constituting 
(at 
least 
in 
part) 
the 
end 
of 
our 
wishes, 
and 
as 
something 
which 
enters 
intoourown 
felicityandgivesus 
satisfaction. 


This 
serves 
to 
reconcile 
two 
truths 
which 
appear 
incompatible; 
for 
we 
do 
all 
for 
our 
own 
good, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
have 
other 
feelings 
whatever 
we 
may 
say. 
Nevertheless 
we 
do 
not 
yet 
love 
altogether 
purely, 
when 
we 
seek 
the 
good 
of 
the 
beloved 
object 
not 
for 
itself 
and 
because 
it 
itself 
pleases 
us, 
but 
because 
of 
an 
advantage 
which 
we 
foresee 
from 
it. 
But 
it 
is 
apparent 
from 
the 
notion 
of 
love 
which 
we 
have 
just 
given 
that 
we 
seek 
at 
thesame 
timeour 
goodfor 
ourselvesandthe 
goodof 
thebeloved 
object 
for 
it 
itself, 
when 
the 
good 
of 
this 
object 
is 
immediately, 
finally 
(ultimato) 
and 
through 
itself 
our 
end, 
our 
pleasure 
and 
our 
good; 
as 
happens 
in 
regard 
to 
all 
the 
things 
wished 
for 
because 
they 
are 
pleasing 
in 
themselves, 
and 
are 
consequently 
good 
of 
themselves, 
even 
if 
one 
should 
have 
no 
regard 
to 
consequences;theseareendsandnotmeans.

of

by

only 
the 
pleasure 
taken

consists 
which

essentially 
the

of

it

to

a

in 
which 
under

of

of 
the 
annihilation 
of 
the

swallowed 
up 
in 
God, 
one 
may 
go 
to 
libertinism 
in 
practice,

at 
least 
to 
a 
hidden 
speculative 
atheism, 
such 
as 
that 
of 
Averroes 
and 
of 
others 
more 
ancient 
who 
taught 
that 
our 
soul 
finally 
lost 
itself 
in 
the 
universal 
spirit, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
perfect 
union 
withGod.

**** 


The 
error 
concerning 
pure 
love 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
misunderstanding, 
which 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said 
to 
you, 
sir, 
comes 
perhaps 
from 
not 
paying 
sufficient 
attentiontoforming 
definitionsof 
terms. 


To 
LOVE 
truly 
and 
disinterestedly 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
to 
be 
led 
to 
find 
pleasure 
in 
the 
perfections 
or 
in 
the 
felicity 
of 
the 
object, 
and 
consequently 
to 
experience 
grief 
in 
what 
may 
be 
contrary 
to 
these 
perfections. 
This 
love 
has 
properly 
for 
its 
object 
substances 
susceptible 
of 
felicity; 
but 
some 
resemblance 
of 
this 
is 
found 
as 
regards 
objects 
which 
have 
perfections 
without 
being 
aware 
of 
it, 
as 
for 
example, 
a 
beautiful 
picture. 
He 
who 
finds 
pleasure 
in 
contemplating 
it 
and 
would 
find 
pain 
in 
seeing 
it 
ruined 
even 
if 
it 
should 
belong 
to 
another,would 
loveit, 
so 
to 
speak, 
with 
a 
disinterestedlove. 
This 
could 
not 
be 
said 
of 
another 
who 
should 
merely 
have 
in 
view 
gain 
in 
selling 
it 
or 
the 
winning 
of 
applause 
by 
showing 
it, 
without 
for 
the 
rest 
caring 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
were 
ruined 
when 
it 
should 
no 
longer 
belong 
to 
him. 
This 
shows 
that 
pleasure 
and 
action 
cannot 
be 
taken 
away 
from 
love 
without 
destroying 
it, 
and 
that 
M. 
des 
Preaux 
in 
the 
beautiful 
verses 
which 
you 
sent 
me, 
was 
right 
both 
in 
recommending 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
divine 
love 
and 
in 
opposing 
a 
love 
which 
is 
chimerical 
and 
without 
effect. 
I 
have 
explained 
my 



definition 
in 
the 
preface 
of 
my 
Codex 
Diplomaticus 
Juris 
Gentium 
(published 
before 
these 
new 
disputes 
arose), 
because 
I 
had 
need 
of 
it 
in 
order 
to 
give 
the 
definition 
of 
JUSTICE, 
which 
in 
my 
opinion 
is 
nothing 
but 
charity 
regulated 
according 
to 
wisdom. 
Now 
CHARITY 
being 
a 
universal 
benevolence, 
and 
BENEVOLENCE 
being 
a 
habit 
of 
loving, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
define 
what 
it 
is 
to 
love. 
And 
since 
to 
LOVE 
is 
to 
have 
a 
feeling 
which 
makes 
us 
find 
pleasure 
in 
what 
conduces 
to 
the 
happiness 
Of 
the 
beloved 
object, 
and 
since 
wisdom 
(which 
makes 
the 
rule 
of 
justice) 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
science 
of 
happiness, 
I 
showed 
by 
this 
analysis 
that 
happiness 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
justice, 
and 
that 
those 
who 
would 
give 
the 
true 
elements 
of 
jurisprudence, 
which 
I 
do 
not 
find 
laid 
down 
as 
they 
should 
be, 
ought 
to 
begin 
by 
establishing 
the 
science 
of 
happiness, 
which 
does 
not 
yet 
appear 
well 
determined, 
although 
books 
on 
Ethicsarefullofdiscoursesonblessedness 
orthesovereigngood. 


As 
PLEASURE, 
which 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
feeling 
of 
rare 
perfection, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
points 
of 
HAPPINESS, 
which 
in 
turn 
consists 
in 
a 
lasting 
condition 
of 
possession 
of 
what 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
taste 
pleasure, 
it 
were 
to 
be 
desired 
that 
the 
science 
of 
pleasures 
which 
the 
late 
M. 
Lautin 
meditated 
had 
beencompleted.

ON 
THE 
CARTESIAN 
DEMONSTRATION 
OF 
THE 
EXISTENCE 
OF 
GOD. 
1700-1. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



IN 
TRUTH 
METAPHYSICS 
is 
natural 
theology, 
and 
the 
same 
God 
who 
is 
the 
source 
of 
all 
good 
is 
also 
the 
principle 
of 
all 
knowledge. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
idea 
of 
God 
embraces 
that 
of 
absolute 
being, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
what 
is 
simple 
in 
our 
thoughts, 
from 
which 
all 
that 
we 
think 
takes 
its 
origin. 
Descartes 
had 
not 
considered 
the 
matter 
from 
this 
side; 
he 
gives 
two 
ways 
of 
proving 
the 
existence 
of 
God: 
the 
first 
is, 
that 
there 
is 
in 
us 
an 
idea 
of 
God, 
since 
we 
undoubtedly 
think 
of 
God 
and 
since 
we 
cannot 
think 
of 
anything 
without 
having 
the 
idea 
of 
it. 
Now 
if 
we 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
God 
and 
if 
it 
is 
a 
true 
one, 
that 
is, 
if 
it 
is 
of 
an 
infinite 
being 
and 
if 
it 
represents 
it 
faithfully, 
it 
cannot 
he 
caused 
by 
anything 
less, 
and 
consequently 
God 
himself 
must 
be 
its 
cause. 
He 
must 
therefore 
exist. 
The 
other 
argument 
is 
still 
shorter. 
It 
is 
that 
God 
is 
a 
being 
which 
possesses 
all 
perfections 
and 
consequently 
possesses 
existence 
which 
is 
in 
the 
number 
of 
perfections; 
hence 
he 
exists. 
It 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
these 
arguments 
are 
a 
little 
suspicious 
because 
they 
advance 
too 
quickly 
and 
do 
violence 
to 
us 
without 
enlightening 
us; 
whereas 
true 
demonstrations 
are 
wont 
to 
fill 
the 
mind 
with 
some 
solid 
nourishment. 
However 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
find 
the 
knot 
of 
the 
matter, 
and 
I 
see 
that 
a 
number 
of 
able 
men 
who 
have 
madeobjectiontoDescarteshave 
passedthis 
by. 


Some 
have 
believed 
that 
there 
is 
no 
idea 
of 
God 
because 
he 
is 
not 
subject 
to 
the 
imagination, 
supposing 
that 
idea 
and 
image 
are 
the 
same 
thing. 
I 
am 
not 
of 
their 
opinion, 
and 
I 
well 
know 
that 
there 
is 
an 
idea 
of 
thought 
and 
of 
existence 
and 
of 
similar 
things 
of 
which 
there 
is 
no 
image. 
For 
we 
think 
of 
something 
and 
when 
we 
remark 
what 
made 
us 
recognize 
it, 
this, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 



inoursoul,is 
the 
ideaofthething. 
This 
iswhythereisalsoanideaofwhatis 
notmaterialor 
imaginable. 


Others 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
an 
idea 
of 
God, 
and 
that 
this 
idea 
embraces 
all 
perfections, 
but 
they 
cannot 
understand 
how 
existence 
follows 
from 
it: 
be 
it 
because 
they 
do 
not 
admit 
that 
existence 
is 
of 
the 
number 
of 
perfections, 
or 
because 
they 
do 
not 
see 
how 
a 
simple 
idea 
or 
thought 
can 
imply 
existence 
outside 
of 
us. 
For 
myself 
I 
well 
believe 
that 
he 
who 
has 
acknowledged 
this 
idea 
of 
God 
and 
who 
fully 
sees 
that 
existence 
is 
a 
perfection, 
ought 
to 
avow 
that 
this 
perfection 
belongs 
to 
God. 
In 
fact 
I 
do 
not 
doubt 
the 
idea 
of 
God 
any 
more 
than 
his 
existence, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
I 
claim 
that 
I 
have 
a 
demonstration 
of 
it; 
but 
I 
would 
not 
that 
we 
flatter 
ourselves 
and 
persuade 
ourselves 
that 
we 
could 
succeed 
in 
so 
great 
a 
matter 
at 
so 
little 
cost. 
Paralogisms 
are 
dangerous 
in 
this 
matter; 
when 
they 
are 
not 
successful 
they 
rebound 
upon 
ourselves 
and 
strengthen 
the 
opposite 
party. 
I 
say 
then 
that 
we 
must 
prove 
with 
all 
imaginable 
accuracy 
that 
there 
is 
an 
idea 
of 
an 
all-perfect 
being, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
of 
God. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
objections 
of 
those 
who 
think 
that 
they 
can 
prove 
the 
contrary 
because 
there 
is 
no 
image 
of 
God 
are 
as 
I 
have 
just 
shown 
worthless; 
but 
it 
must 
also 
be 
confessed 
that 
the 
proof 
which 
Descartes 
offers 
for 
establishing 
the 
idea 
of 
God 
is 
imperfect. 
How, 
he 
will 
say, 
can 
we 
speak 
of 
God 
without 
thinking 
of 
him. 
And 
could 
we 
think 
of 
God 
without 
having 
the 
idea 
of 
him? 
Yes, 
undoubtedly, 
we 
sometimes 
think 
of 
impossible 
things, 
and 
this 
has 
even 
been 
demonstrated; 
for 
example, 
Descartes 
held 
that 
the 
quadrature 
of 
the 
circle 
is 
impossible, 
and 
yet 
we 
do 
not 
cease 
to 
think 
of 
it 
and 
to 
draw 
consequences 
as 
to 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
it 
were 
possible. 
Motion 
of 
ultimate 
swiftness 
is 
impossible 
in 
any 
body 
whatever, 
for 
if 
it 
were 
supposed 
in 
a 
circle, 
for 
example,another 
concentric 
circle, 
surrounding 
the 
first 
and 
attached 
firmly 
to 
it, 
would 
be 
moved 
with 
a 
velocity 
still 
greater 
than 
the 
first, 
which 
consequently 
is 
not 
of 
the 
ultimate 
degree, 
contrary 
to 



what 
we 
have 
supposed. 
All 
this 
to 
the 
contrary 
notwithstanding, 
we 
think 
of 
this 
ultimate 
swiftness 
which 
has 
no 
idea 
since 
it 
is 
impossible. 
So 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
circles 
is 
an 
impossible 
thing, 
and 
a 
number 
made 
up 
of 
all 
possible 
units 
is 
no 
less 
so: 
there 
is 
proof 
of 
it. 
And 
nevertheless 
we 
think 
of 
all 
this. 
This 
is 
why 
there 
is 
certainly 
room 
to 
doubt 
whether 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
stars 
is 
to 
be 
trusted 
and 
whether 
it 
does 
not 
involve 
some 
contradiction; 
for 
I 
well 
understand, 
for 
example, 
the 
nature 
of 
motion 
and 
of 
swiftness, 
and 
what 
greatest 
is. 
But 
for 
all 
that 
I 
do 
not 
understand 
whether 
all 
this 
is 
compatible 
and 
whether 
there 
is 
a 
way 
of 
joining 
all 
this 
and 
making 
therefrom 
an 
idea 
of 
the 
greatest 
swiftness 
of 
which 
motion 
is 
capable. 
So 
although 
I 
know 
what 
star 
is, 
and 
what 
largest 
and 
most 
perfect 
are, 
nevertheless, 
I 
do 
not 
yet 
know 
whether 
there 
is 
not 
a 
hidden 
contradiction 
in 
joining 
all 
these 
together, 
as 
there 
is 
in 
fact 
in 
the 
other 
examples 
mentioned. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
a 
word, 
I 
do 
not 
know 
for 
all 
this 
whether 
such 
a 
star 
is 
possible; 
for 
if 
it 
were 
not 
there 
would 
be 
no 
idea 
of 
it. 
However, 
I 
confess, 
that 
God 
in 
this 
respect 
has 
a 
great 
advantage 
over 
all 
other 
things. 
For 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
prove 
that 
he 
is 
possible 
to 
prove 
that 
he 
exists, 
a 
thing 
not 
encountered 
anywhere 
else 
that 
I 
know 
of. 
Furthermore 
I 
inferfromthisthatthereisa 
presumption 
thatGod 
exists 
forthereisalwaysa 
presumption 
on 
the 
side 
of 
possibility; 
that 
is 
to 
say 
everything 
is 
held 
to 
be 
possible 
until 
its 
impossibility 
is 
proved. 
There 
is 
therefore 
also 
a 
presumptionthatGodispossible, 
that 
is,thathe 
exists, 
since 
in 
him 
existence 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
possibility. 
This 
may 
suffice 
for 
practical 
life 
but 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
for 
a 
demonstration. 
I 
have 
disputed 
much 
on 
this 
point 
with 
severalCartesians, 
but, 
finally, 
I 
have 
gotten 
some 
of 
themore 
able 
to 
frankly 
confess, 
after 
having 
understood 
the 
force 
of 
my 
arguments, 
that 
this 
possibility 
was 
still 
to 
be 
demonstrated. 
There 
are 
even 
some 
who 
after 
being 
challenged 
by 
me 
have 
undertaken 
to 
demonstrate 
this 
but 
they 
have 
not 
yet 



completed 
it.

Extract 
from 
an 
undated 
letter 
to 
(probably) 
the 
Grand 
Duchess 
Sophia. 


I 
have 
not 
yet 
seen 
the 
work 
published 
at 
Basle 
in 
the 
year 
1699, 
entitled 
Judicium 
de 
argumento 
Cartesii 
pro 
existentia 
Dei 
petito 
ab 
ejus 
idea; 
but 
having 
formerly 
casually 
examined 
the 
same 
argument 
in 
an 
essay 
On 
Knowledge, 
Truth 
and 
Ideas, 
inserted 
in 
the 
Acta 
of 
Leipzig, 
in 
the 
year 
1684, 
I 
am 
curious 
to 
read 
what 
an 
able 
man 
says 
in 
the 
Histoire 
des 
Ouvorages 
des 
Savons, 
May, 
1700, 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
arguments 
of 
Descartes 
and 
against 
the 
Latin 
work 
published 
at 
Basle. 
And 
I 
will 
say 
to 
you, 
sir, 
that 
I 
hold 
a 
position 
midway 
between 
the 
work 
and 
the 
reply. 
The 
author 
of 
the 
work 
believes 
that 
the 
argument 
is 
a 
sophism, 
the 
author 
of 
the 
reply 
considers 
it 
a 
demonstration, 
and 
I 
myself 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
an 
imperfect 
argument 
which 
tacitly 
takes 
for 
granted 
a 
proposition 
the 
proof 
of 
which, 
if 
added, 
would 
complete 
the 
demonstration. 
Thus 
the 
argument 
is 
not 
to 
be 
despised; 
it 
is 
at 
least 
a 
good 
beginning. 
Est 
aliquid 
prodire 
tenus, 
si 
non 
datur 
ultra. 


Geometricians, 
who 
are 
the 
true 
masters 
of 
the 
art 
of 
reasoning, 
have 
seen 
that 
in 
order 
that 
demonstrations 
drawn 
from 
definitions 
may 
be 
good, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
prove, 
or 
at 
least 
postulate, 
that 
the 
notion 
embraced 
in 
the 
definition 
is 
possible. 
This 
is 
why 
Euclid 
placed 
among 
his 
postulata, 
that 
the 
circle 
is 
something 
possible, 
in 
asking 
that 
a 
circle, 
the 
center 
and 
radius 
of 
which 
are 
given, 
be 
described. 
The 
same 
precaution 
holds 
good 
in 
every 
sort 
of 
reasoning, 
and 
particularly 
in 
the 
argument 
of 
Anselm, 
archbishop 
of 
Canterbury 
(in 
Liber 
contra 
insipientem), 
quoted 
and 
examined 
by 
St. 
Thomas 
and 
other 
scholastics, 
and 
renewed 
by 
Descartes, 
which 
proves 
that 
God, 
being 
the 
greatest 
or 
most 
perfect 
being, 
embraces 
that 
perfection 
called 
existence, 
and 
that 
consequently 
he 
exists. 
To 
this 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
reasoning 
is 
sound, 
supposing 
that 
the 
being 
sovereignly 
perfect 
or 
which 



embraces 
all 
perfections, 
is 
possible; 
and 
that 
it 
is 
the 
privilege 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
(ms 
a 
se) 
that 
its 
essence 
comprises 
existence, 
that 
is, 
that 
it 
exists 
provided 
it 
is 
possible. 
And 
even 
omitting 
all 
mention 
of 
perfection 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
if 
necessary 
being 
is 
possible 
it 
exists. 
This 
is 
undoubtedly 
the 
most 
beautiful 
and 
the 
mostimportant 
of 
modal 
propositions, 
because 
itfurnishes 
a 
passage 
from 
power 
to 
act, 
and 
it 
is 
solely 
here 
that 
posse 
ad 
esse 
valet 
conseguentia. 
Alsoherein 
isfoundtheprincipleof 
existences. 


The 
author 
of 
the 
work 
opposes 
an 
example 
to 
Descartes, 
in 
reasoning 
as 
he 
does 
and 
reaching 
a 
false 
conclusion, 
for 
he 
says 
that 
existence 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
very 
perfect 
body 
(or 
one 
which 
comprises 
all 
perfection), 
hence 
such 
a 
body 
exists. 
To 
this, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
reply 
must 
he 
made 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
very 
perfect 
being 
in 
this 
sense 
is 
impossible, 
for 
a 
body 
being 
limited 
by 
its 
essence 
cannot 
include 
all 
perfections. 
The 
work 
and 
the 
reply 
give 
themselves 
up 
a 
little 
too 
much 
to 
the 
terms 
and 
distinctions 
of 
real 
(or 
formal) 
and 
objective, 
essence 
and 
existence, 
whither 
I 
do 
not 
think 
it 
necessary 
to 
follow 
them. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
to 
remark 
that 
the 
authoroftheworkhavingproposed 
tohimselfthereasoningofthosewhosay 
that 
God 
must 
necessarily 
exist 
because 
it 
is 
not 
impossible 
that 
God 
be, 
has 
touched 
the 
essential 
point 
and 
has 
replied 
by 
no 
means 
badly 
that 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
possible 
because 
we 
do’ 
not 
see 
its 
impossibility, 
our 
knowledge 
being 
limited. 
But 
this 
might 
have 
led 
him 
to 
think 
that 
the 
argument 
is 
not 
a 
sophism 
and 
that 
those 
who 
have 
proposed 
it 
have 
sinned 
only 
in 
concealing 
what 
they 
presuppose, 
instead 
of 
following 
the 
example 
of 
the 
geometricians, 
who 
have 
penetration 
and 
sincerity 
enough 
to 
see 
and 
expressly 
indicate 
the 
axioms 
and 
postulates 
of 
which 
they 
have 
need 
and 
which 
theypresuppose. 


The 
author 
of 
the 
reply, 
as 
far 
as 
I 
can 
understand 
him, 
does 
not 
enter 
sufficiently 
into 
this; 
he 
has 
good 
reason, 
p. 
211, 
for 
rejecting 
this 
limitation: 



that 
wholly 
perfect 
being 
includes 
existence 
if 
it 
be 
supposed 
that 
there 
is 
a 
wholly 
perfect 
being, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
an 
actual. 
But 
if 
we 
understand 
it 
thus: 
if 
it 
be 
supposed 
that 
there 
is 
a 
wholly 
perfect 
being 
possible 
or 
among 
essences, 


the 
limitation 
is 
good. 
He 
is 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
not 
permissible 
to 
doubt 
things 
which 
are 
known 
to 
us 
under 
the 
pretext 
that 
our 
knowledge 
is 
limited. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
author 
of 
the 
work. 
I 
have 
already 
remarked 
in 
my 
essay, 
before 
mentioned, 
that 
the 
true 
mark 
of 
perfectly 
distinct 
knowledge 
is 
that 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
notion 
in 
question 
can 
be 
proved 
a 
priori. 
Thus 
he 
is 
fundamentally 
wrong 
here 
in 
attributing 
to 
himself 
a 
clear 
and 
distinct 
notion 
when 
he 
cannot 
verify 
it 
by 
the 
mark 
which 
is 
essential 
to 
it. 
The 
example 
of 
the 
proposition 
that 
two 
and 
two 
are 
four 
is 
not 
applicable 
here 
because 
it 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
definitions 
the 
possibilityofwhichisrecognized. 
— 
Extract 
from 
a 
letter 
to 
——, 
1700. 


I 
have 
already 
elsewhere 
given 
my 
opinion 
concerning 
St. 
Anselm’s 
demonstration 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
renewed 
by 
Descartes; 
the 
substance 
of 
which 
is 
that 
that 
which 
embraces 
in 
its 
idea 
all 
perfections, 
or 
the 
greatest 
of 
all 
possible 
beings, 
comprehends 
also 
in 
its 
essence 
existence, 
since 
existence 
is 
in 
the 
number 
of 
perfections, 
and 
otherwise 
something 
could 
be 
added 
to 
that 
which 
is 
perfect. 
I 
hold 
a 
medium 
between 
those 
who 
take 
this 
reasoning 
for 
a 
sophism 
and 
the 
opinion 
of 
Reverend 
Father 
Lami, 
explained 
here, 
who 
considers 
it 
a 
complete 
demonstration. 
I 
admit 
then 
that 
it 
is 
a 
demonstration, 
but 
imperfect, 
which 
demands 
or 
supposes 
a 
truth 
which 
deserves 
to 
be 
further 
demonstrated. 
For 
it, 
is 
tacitly 
supposed 
that 
GOD, 
or 
the 
PERFECT 
BEING, 
is 
possible. 
If 
this 
point 
were 
again 
demonstrated, 
as 
it 
should 
be, 
it 
could 
be 
said 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
was 
demonstrated 
geometrically 
a 
priori. 
And 
this 
shows 
what 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
that 
we 
cannot 
reason 
perfectly 
on 
ideas 
except 
by 
knowing 
their 
possibility 
to 
which 
geometricians 
have 
paid 
attention, 
but 
the 
Cartesians 
not 
sufficiently. 



However 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
this 
demonstration 
is 
none 
the 
less 
of 
importance, 
and 
so 
to 
speak, 
presumptive. 
For 
every 
being 
must 
be 
held 
possible 
until 
its 
impossibility 
is 
proved. 
I 
doubt 
however 
whether 
Reverend 
Father 
Lami 
was 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
adopted 
by 
the 
School. 
For 
the 
author 
of 
the 
marginalnote 
remarkshere 
veryjustlythatSt. 
Thomashad 
rejectedit. 


However 
this 
may 
be, 
a 
demonstration 
still 
more 
simple 
might 
be 
formed, 
not 
mentioning 
the 
perfections 
at 
all, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
stopped 
by 
those 
who 
should 
venture 
to 
deny 
that 
all 
perfections 
are 
compatible, 
and 
consequently 
that 
the 
idea 
in 
question 
is 
possible. 
For 
by 
simply 
saying 
that 
God 
is 
a 
being 
of 
itself 
or 
primative, 
ens 
a 
se, 
that 
is, 
which 
exists 
by 
its 
essence 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
conclude 
from 
this 
definition 
that 
such 
a 
being, 
if 
it 
is 
possible, 
exists; 
or 
rather, 
this 
conclusion 
is 
a 
corollary 
which 
is 
derived 
immediately 
from 
the 
definition, 
and 
hardly 
differs 
from 
it. 
For 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
thing 
being 
only 
that 
which 
makes 
its 
possibility 
in 
particular, 
it 
is 
very 
clear 
that 
to 
exist 
by 
its 
essence,is 
to 
existby 
its 
possibility. 
And 
if 
the 
being 
of 
itself 
were 
defined 
in 
terms 
still 
nearer, 
by 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
the 
being 
which 
must 
exist 
because 
it 
is 
possible, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
all 
which 
could 
be 
said 
against 
the 
existence 
of 
suchabeing,wouldbetodeny 
itspossibility. 


Onthis 
subjectwemight 
againmakeamodal 
proposition,whichwould 
be 
one 
of 
the 
best 
fruits 
of 
all 
logic: 
namely, 
that 
if 
necessary 
being 
is 
possible, 
it 
exists. 
For 
necessary 
being 
and 
being 
by 
its 
essence 
are 
only 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing. 
Thus 
the 
reasoning 
taken 
with 
this 
bias 
appears 
to 
have 
solidity; 
and 
those 
who 
will 
have 
it 
that 
from 
mere 
notions, 
ideas, 
definitions 
or 
possible 
essences, 
actual 
existence 
can 
never 
be 
inferred, 
in 
truth 
fall 
into 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said, 
namely, 
they 
deny 
the 
possibility 
of 
being 
of 
itself. 
But 
it 
is 
well 
to 
notice 
that 
this 
bias 
itself 
serves 
to 
show 
that 
they 
are 
wrong, 
and 
fills 
up 
finally 
the 
gap 
in 
the 
demonstration. 
For 
if 
being 
of 
itself 
is 
impossible, 
all 
beings 
by 
others 
are 
so 
also; 
since 
they 
exist 
ultimately 
only 



through 
being 
of 
itself; 
thus 
nothing 
could 
exist. 
This 
reasoning 
leads 
us 
to 
another 
important 
modal 
proposition, 
equal 
to 
the 
preceding, 
and 
which 
joined 
with 
it, 
completes 
the 
demonstration. 
It 
might 
be 
expressed 
thus: 
If 
necessary 
being 
is 
not, 
there 
is 
no 
being 
possible. 
It 
seems 
that 
this 
demonstration 
has 
not 
been 
carried 
so 
far 
up 
to 
this 
time. 
However 
I 
have 
also 
laboredelsewhereto 
provethattheperfectbeingispossible. 


I 
designed, 
sir, 
merely 
to 
write 
you 
in 
few 
words 
some 
trifling 
reflections 
on 
the 
memoirs 
which 
you 
sent 
me; 
but 
the 
variety 
of 
matters, 
the 
heat 
of 
meditation 
and 
the 
pleasure 
which 
I 
have 
taken 
in 
the 
generous 
design 
of 
the 
Prince 
who 
is 
the 
protector 
of 
this 
work, 
have 
earned 
me 
on.

for

CONSIDERATIONSON 
THE 
DOCTRINE 
OF 
A 
UNIVERSAL 
SPIRIT. 
1702. 



MANY 
INGENIOUS 
PERSONS 
have 
believed, 
and 
believe 
now, 
that 
there 
is 
but 
one 
spirit, 
which 
is 
universal 
and 
which 
animates 
all 
the 
universe 
and 
all 
its 
parts, 
each 
one 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
structure 
and 
organs, 
just 
as 
the 
same 
breath 
of 
wind 
makes 
the 
various 
pipes 
of 
an 
organ 
give 
forth 
different 
sounds. 
And 
that 
thus 
when 
an 
animal 
has 
its 
organs 
well 
placed, 
it 
produces 
there 
the 
effect 
of 
an 
individual 
soul, 
but 
when 
the 
organs 
are 
spoiled, 
this 
individual 
soul 
again 
becomes 
nothingness, 
or 
returns, 
so 
to 
speak, 
into 
the 
ocean 
oftheuniversalspirit. 


Aristotle 
has 
seemed 
to 
many 
to 
hold 
a 
like 
opinion, 
which 
Averroes, 
a 
celebrated 
Arabian 
philosopher, 
has 
renewed. 
He 
believed 
that 
there 
was 
in 
usan 
intellectus 
agens 
oractiveunderstanding,andalso 
an 
intellectus 
patiens 
or 
passive 
understanding: 
that 
the 
former, 
coming 
from 
without, 
was 
eternal 
and 
universal 
for 
all, 
but 
that 
the 
passive 
understanding 
was 
peculiar 
to 
each, 
and 
took 
its 
departure 
at 
the 
death 
of 
man. 
In 
the 
last 
two 
or 
three 
centuries, 
this 
has 
been 
the 
doctrine 
of 
some 
Peripatetics, 
as 
of 
Pomponatius, 
Contarenus 
and 
others; 
and 
traces 
of 
it 
are 
to 
be 
recognized 
in 
the 
late 
M. 
Naudé, 
as 
his 
letters 
and 
the 
Naudæana, 
which 
have 
been 
lately 
published, 
show. 
They 
taught 
this 
in 
secret 
to 
their 
most 
intimate 
and 
best 
qualified 
disciples, 
while 
in 
public 
they 
had 
the 
cleverness 
to 
say 
that 
this 
doctrine 
was 
in 
reality 
true 
according 
to 
philosophy, 
by 
which 
they 
understood 
that 
of 
Aristotle 
par 
excellence. 
but 
that 
it 
was 
false 
according 
to 
faith. 
Hence 
have 
finally 
arisen 
the 
disputes 
over 
double 
truth 
which 
the 
last 
Lateran 
Council 
condemned. 



I 
have 
been 
told 
that 
Queen 
Christina 
had 
a 
decided 
leaning 
toward 
this 
opinion, 
and 
as 
M. 
Naudé, 
who 
was 
her 
librarian, 
was 
imbued 
with 
it, 
he 
probably 
communicated 
to 
her 
what 
he 
knew 
of 
the 
secret 
views 
of 
the 
celebrated 
philosophers 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
had 
intercourse 
in 
Italy. 
Spinoza, 
who 
admits 
only 
one 
substance, 
is 
not 
far 
removed 
from 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
single, 
universal 
spirit, 
and 
even 
the 
New 
Cartesians, 
who 
claim 
that 
God 
alone 
acts, 
establish 
it 
likewise 
without 
noticing 
it. 
Apparently 
Molinos 
and 
several 
other 
New 
Quietists, 
among 
others, 
a 
certain 
Joannes 
Angelus 
Silesius, 
who 
wrote 
before 
Molinos 
and 
some 
of 
whose 
works 
have 
recently 
been 
reprinted, 
and 
even 
Weigelius 
before 
them, 
embracedthis 
opinionofthe 
sabbath 
or 
rest 
of 
souls 
in 
God. 
This 
is 
why 
they 
believed 
that 
the 
cessation 
ofparticularfunctions 
wasthehigheststateof 
perfection. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
Peripatetic 
philosophers 
did 
not 
make 
this 
spirit 
quite 
universal, 
for 
besides 
the 
intelligences, 
which 
according 
to 
them, 
animated 
the 
stars, 
they 
had 
an 
intelligence 
for 
this 
world 
here 
below; 
and 
this 
intelligence 
performed 
the 
part 
of 
the 
active 
understanding 
in 
the 
souls 
of 
men. 
They 
were 
led 
to 
this 
doctrine 
of 
an 
immortal 
soul 
common 
to 
all 
men, 
byfalsereasoning. 
Fortheytookforgrantedthatactualinfinitemultiplicityis 
impossible 
and 
that 
thus 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
that 
there 
should 
be 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
souls, 
but 
that 
there 
must 
be 
nevertheless, 
if 
individual 
souls 
existed. 
For 
the 
world 
being, 
according 
to 
them, 
eternal, 
and 
the 
human 
race 
also, 
and 
new 
souls 
always 
being 
born, 
if 
these 
all 
continued 
to 
exist, 
there 
would 
now 
be 
an 
actual 
infinity. 
This 
reasoning 
passed 
among 
them 
for 
a 
proof. 
But 
it 
was 
full 
of 
false 
suppositions. 
For 
neither 
the 
impossibility 
of 
actual 
infinitude, 
nor 
that 
the 
human 
race 
has 
existed 
eternally, 
nor 
the 
generation 
of 
new 
souls, 
would 
be 
admitted, 
since 
the 
Platonists 
teach 
the 
preëxistence 
of 
souls, 
and 
the 
Pythagoreans 
teach 
metempsychosis, 
and 
claim 



that 
a 
certain 
determined 
number 
of 
souls 
remains 
ever 
and 
undergoes 
changes. 


The 
doctrine 
of 
a 
universalspirit 
is 
good 
initself, 
forall 
thosewho 
teachit 
admit 
in 
effect 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
divinity, 
whether 
they 
believe 
that 
this 
universal 
spirit 
is 
supreme 
— 
for 
in 
this 
case 
they 
hold 
that 
it 
is 
God 
himself 
—, 
or 
whether 
they 
believe 
with 
the 
Cabalists 
that 
God 
created 
it. 
This 
latter 
was 
also 
the 
opinion 
of 
Henry 
More, 
an 
Englishman, 
and 
of 
certain 
other 
modern 
philosophers, 
and 
especially 
of 
certain 
chemists 
who 
believed 
in 
a 
universal 
Arcbæus 
or 
world-spirit; 
and 
some 
have 
maintained 
that 
it 
was 
this 
spirit 
of 
the 
Lord 
which, 
as 
the 
beginning 
of 
Genesis 
says, 
“moved 
upon 
the 
waters.” 


But 
when 
they 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
say 
that 
this 
universal 
spirit 
is 
the 
only 
spirit 
and 
that 
there 
are 
no 
souls 
or 
individual 
spirits, 
or 
at 
least 
that 
these 
individual 
souls 
cease 
to 
exist, 
I 
believe 
that 
they 
pass 
the 
limits 
of 
reason, 
and 
advance, 
without 
grounds, 
a 
doctrine 
of 
which 
they 
have 
not 
even 
a 
distinct 
notion. 
Let 
us 
examine 
a 
little 
the 
apparent 
reasons 
upon 
which 
they 
rest 
this 
doctrine 
which 
destroys 
the 
immortality 
of 
souls 
and 
degrades 
the 
human 
race, 
or 
rather, 
all 
living 
creatures, 
from 
that 
rank 
which 
belongs 
to 
them 
and 
which 
has 
commonly 
been 
attributed 
to 
them. 
For 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
an 
opinion 
of 
so 
much 
importance 
ought 
to 
be 
proved, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
have 
imagined 
a 
supposition 
of 
this 
kind, 
which 
really 
is 
only 
founded 
on 
a 
very 
shocking 
comparison 
with 
the 
wind 
which 
animates 
musicalorgans. 


I 
have 
showed 
above 
that 
the 
pretended 
demonstration 
of 
the 
Peripatetics 
who 
maintained 
that 
there 
was 
but 
one 
spirit, 
common 
to 
all 
men, 
is 
of 
no 
force, 
and 
rests 
only 
on 
false 
suppositions. 
Spinoza 
has 
pretended 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
substance 
in 
the 
World, 
but 
these 
proofs 
are 
contemptible 
or 
unintelligible. 
And 
the 
New 
Cartesians, 
who 
believed 
that 



God 
alone 
is 
active, 
gave 
no 
proof 
of 
it; 
not 
to 
mention 
that 
Father 
Malebranche 
seemed 
to 
admit 
at 
least 
the 
internal 
action 
of 
individual 
spirits. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
apparent 
reasons 
which 
have 
been 
urged 
against 
individual 
souls, 
is 
the 
embarrassment 
as 
to 
their 
origin. 
The 
scholastic 
philosophers 
have 
disputed 
greatly 
over 
the 
origin 
of 
forms, 
among 
which 
they 
include 
souls. 
Opinions 
differed 
greatly 
as 
to 
whether 
there 
was 
an 
eduction 
of 
power 
from 
matter, 
as 
a 
statue 
is 
extracted 
from 
marble; 
or 
whether 
there 
was 
a 
traduction 
of 
souls 
so 
that 
a 
new 
soul 
should 
be 
born 
of 
a 
preceding 
soul 
as 
one 
fire 
is 
lighted 
from 
another; 
or 
whether 
souls 
already 
existed 
and 
only 
made 
themselves 
known 
after 
the 
generation 
of 
the 
animal; 
or 
finally 
whether 
soulswerecreatedbyGodevery 
timetherewasanew 
generation. 


Those 
who 
denied 
individual 
souls, 
believed 
that 
they 
were 
thereby 
freeing 
themselves 
from 
all 
difficulties, 
but 
this 
is 
cutting 
the 
knot 
instead 
of 
untying 
it, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
force 
in 
an 
argument 
which 
would 
run 
thus: 
the 
explanations 
of 
a 
doctrine 
have 
been 
various, 
hence 
the 
whole 
doctrine 
is 
false. 
This 
is 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
sceptics 
reason 
and 
if 
it 
were 
to 
be 
accepted, 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
which 
could 
not 
be 
rejected. 
The 
experiments 
of 
our 
time 
lead 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
souls 
and 
even 
animals 
have 
always 
existed, 
although 
in 
small 
volume, 
and 
that 
generation 
is 
only 
a 
kind 
of 
growth; 
and 
in 
this 
way 
all 
the 
difficulties 
concerning 
the 
generation 
of 
souls 
and 
of 
forms, 
disappear. 
However 
we 
do 
not 
refuse 
God 
the 
right 
to 
create 
new 
souls 
or 
to 
give 
a 
higher 
degree 
of 
perfection 
to 
those 
which 
are 
already 
in 
nature, 
but 
we 
speak 
of 
what 
is 
ordinary 
in 
nature 
without 
entering 
into 
the 
particular 
economy 
of 
God 
in 
respect 
to 
human 
souls, 
which 
may 
haveprivilegessincetheyareinfinitelyabovethoseofanimals. 


In 
my 
opinion 
what 
has 
greatly 
contributed 
to 
incline 
ingenious 
persons 
toward 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
single 
universal 
spirit, 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
common 
philosophers 
gave 
currency 
to 
a 
theory, 
treating 
of 
separate 
souls 
and 
the 



functions 
of 
the 
soul 
independent 
of 
the 
body 
and 
of 
the 
organs, 
which 
they 
could 
not 
sufficiently 
justify; 
they 
had 
good 
reason 
for 
wishing 
to 
maintain 
the 
immortality 
of 
the 
soul 
as 
in 
accordance 
with 
divine 
perfections 
and 
true 
morality, 
but 
seeing 
that, 
in 
death, 
the 
organs 
visible 
in 
animals 
became 
disordered 
and 
finally 
spoiled, 
they 
believed 
themselves 
obliged 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
separate 
souls, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
soul 
existed 
without 
any 
body, 
and 
did 
not 
even 
then 
cease 
to 
have 
its 
thoughts 
and 
activities. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
better 
prove 
this 
they 
tried 
to 
show 
that 
the 
soul, 
even 
in 
this 
life, 
has 
abstract 
thoughts, 
independent 
of 
material 
ideas. 
Now 
those 
who 
rejected 
this 
separate 
state 
and 
this 
independence, 
as 
contrary 
to 
experience 
and 
reason, 
were 
all 
the 
more 
compelled 
to 
believe 
in 
the 
extinction 
of 
the 
particular 
soul 
and 
the 
preservation 
of 
the 
single, 
universal 
spirit. 


I 
have 
examined 
this 
matter 
carefully 
and 
I 
have 
proved 
that 
really 
there 
are 
in 
the 
soul 
some 
materials 
of 
thought 
or 
objects 
of 
the 
understanding 
which 
the 
external 
senses 
do 
not 
furnish, 
namely, 
the 
soul 
itself 
and 
its 
activities 
(nihil 
est 
in 
intellectu 
quod 
non 
fuerit 
in 
sensu, 
nisi 
ipse 
intellectus); 
and 
those 
who 
believe 
in 
a 
universal 
spirit 
will 
readily 
grant 
this, 
since 
they 
distinguish 
it 
from 
matter. 
I 
find, 
nevertheless, 
that 
there 
is 
never 
an 
abstract 
thought 
which 
is 
not 
accompanied 
by 
some 
images 
or 
material 
traces, 
and 
I 
have 
established 
a 
perfect 
parallelism 
between 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
soul 
and 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
matter, 
having, 
shown 
that 
the 
soul 
with 
its 
activities 
is 
something 
distinct 
from 
matter, 
but 
that 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
always 
accompanied 
by 
organs 
which 
must 
correspond 
to 
it; 
and 
that 
this 
is 
reciprocal 
andalways 
willbe. 


And 
as 
to 
the 
complete 
separation 
between 
soul 
and 
body, 
although 
I 
can 
say 
nothing 
beyond 
what 
is 
said 
in 
the 
Holy 
Scriptures 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
grace 
and 
of 
what 
God 
has 
ordained 
in 
respect 
to 
human 
souls 
in 
particular 
— 
since 



these 
are 
things 
which 
cannot 
he 
known 
through 
the 
reason 
and 
which 
depend 
upon 
revelation 
and 
upon 
God 
himself, 
nevertheless, 
I 
see 
no 
reason 
either 
in 
religion 
or 
in 
philosophy, 
which 
obliges 
me 
to 
give 
up 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
parallelism 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
and 
to 
admit 
a 
perfect 
separation. 
For 
why 
might 
not 
the 
soul 
always 
retain 
a 
subtile 
body, 
organized 
in 
its 
fashion, 
and 
even 
resume 
some 
day, 
in 
the 
resurrection, 
as 
much 
as 
is 
necessary 
of 
its 
visible 
body, 
since 
we 
accord 
to 
the 
blessed 
a 
glorious 
body 
and 
since 
the 
ancient 
Fathers 
accordeda 
subtilebodyto 
theangels? 


Moreover 
this 
doctrine 
is 
conformable 
to 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
established 
through 
experience; 
for 
the 
observations 
of 
very 
skillful 
observers 
make 
us 
believe 
that 
animals 
do 
not 
begin 
when 
the 
ordinary 
person 
thinks 
they 
do, 
and 
that 
the 
seminal 
animals, 
or 
animated 
seeds, 
have 
existed 
ever 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
things. 
Order 
and 
reason 
demand 
also 
that 
what 
has 
existed 
since 
the 
beginning 
should 
not 
end; 
and 
thus 
as 
generation 
is 
only 
the 
growth 
of 
a 
transformed 
and 
developed 
animal, 
so 
death 
will 
only 
he 
the 
diminution 
of 
a 
transformed 
and 
developed 
animal, 
while 
the 
animal 
itself 
will 
always 
remain, 
during 
the 
transformations, 
as 
the 
silkworm 
and 
the 
butterfly 
are 
the 
same 
animal. 
And 
it 
is 
well 
to 
remark 
here 
that 
nature 
has 
the 
skill 
and 
the 
goodnesstorevealits 
secrets 
tous 
ina 
fewlittlesamples,to 
make 
usjudgeof 
the 
rest, 
since 
everything 
is 
correspondent 
and 
harmonious. 
It 
shows 
this 
also 
inthetransformationofcaterpillars 
andof 
some 
insects 
—forfliesalsocome 
from 
worms 
— 
to 
make 
us 
divine 
that 
there 
are 
transformations 
everywhere. 
Experiments 
with 
insects 
have 
destroyed 
the 
common 
belief 
that 
these 
animals 
are 
engendered 
through 
nourishment, 
without 
propagation. 
It 
is 
thus 
also 
that 
nature 
has 
shown 
us 
in 
the 
birds 
a 
specimen 
of 
the 
generation 
of 
all 
animals 
by 
means 
of 
eggs, 
a 
fact 
which 
new 
discoveries 
have 
now 
established. 
Experiments 
also 
with 
the 
microscope 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
butterflyisonlyadevelopmentofthecaterpillar;but,aboveall,thattheseeds 



contain 
the 
plant 
or 
animal 
already 
formed, 
although 
afterward 
it 
needs 
transformation 
and 
nutrition 
or 
growth 
in 
order 
to 
become 
an 
animal 
perceptible 
to 
our 
ordinary 
senses. 
And 
as 
the 
smallest 
insects 
are 
also 
engendered 
by 
the 
propagation 
of 
the 
species, 
we 
must 
judge 
the 
same 
to 
be 
true 
of 
these 
little 
seminal 
animals, 
namely, 
that 
they 
themselves 
come 
from 
other 
seminal 
animals, 
even 
smaller, 
and 
so 
began 
to 
exist 
when 
the 
world 
did. 
This 
is 
in 
harmony 
with 
the 
Sacred 
Scriptures, 
which 
imply 
that 
seeds 
existedfirst 
ofall. 


Nature 
has 
givenus 
an 
example 
in 
sleep 
andswoons,which 
ought 
to 
make 
us 
believe 
that 
death 
is 
not 
a 
cessation 
of 
all 
the 
functions, 
but 
only 
a 
suspension 
of 
certain 
of 
the 
more 
noticeable 
functions. 
And 
I 
have 
explained 
elsewhere 
an 
important 
point, 
which 
not 
having 
been 
sufficiently 
considered 
has 
the 
more 
easily 
inclined 
men 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
mortality 
of 
souls: 
namely, 
that 
a 
large 
number 
of 
minute 
perceptions, 
equal 
and 
interbalanced, 
having 
no 
background 
and 
no 
distinguishing 
marks, 
are 
not 
noticed 
and 
cannot 
he 
remembered. 
But 
to 
wish 
to 
conclude 
from 
this 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
then 
altogether 
without 
functions 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
when 
the 
common 
people 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
a 
vacuum 
or 
nothing 
where 
there 
is 
no 
visible 
matter, 
and 
that 
the 
earth 
is 
without 
motion, 
because 
its 
motion 
is 
not 
noticeable, 
being 
uniform 
and 
without 
shocks. 
We 
have 
innumerable 
minute 
perceptions 
which 
we 
cannot 
distinguish; 
a 
great 
deafening 
noise, 
as, 
for 
example, 
the 
murmur 
of 
a 
whole 
assembled 
people, 
is 
composed 
of 
all 
the 
little 
murmurs 
of 
particular 
persons 
which 
we 
would 
not 
notice 
separately, 
but 
of 
which 
we 
have 
nevertheless 
a 
sensation, 
otherwise 
we 
would 
not 
be 
sensible 
of 
the 
whole. 
So 
when 
an 
animal 
is 
deprived 
of 
the 
organs 
capable 
of 
giving 
it 
sufficiently 
distinct 
perceptions, 
it 
does 
not 
at 
all 
follow 
that 
there 
do 
not 
remain 
to 
it 
smaller 
and 
more 
uniform 
perceptions, 
nor 
that 
it 
is 
deprived 
of 
all 
organs 
and 
all 
perceptions. 
The 
organs 
are 
only 
folded 
up 
and 
reduced 
to 



small 
volume, 
but 
the 
order 
of 
nature 
demands 
that 
everything 
redevelop, 
and, 
some 
day, 
return 
to 
a 
visible 
state, 
and 
that 
there 
be 
in 
these 
changes 
a 
certain 
well-regulated 
progress, 
which 
serves 
to 
make 
things 
ripen 
and 
become 
perfect. 
It 
appears 
that 
Democritus 
himself 
saw 
this 
resuscitation 
of 
animals,forPlotinussaysthathetaught 
aresurrection. 


All 
these 
considerations 
show 
how 
not 
only 
individual 
souls, 
but 
also 
animals, 
exist, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
in 
an 
utter 
extinction 
of 
souls 
nor 
a 
complete 
destruction 
of 
the 
animal, 
and 
consequently 
that 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
a 
single 
universal 
spirit 
and 
to 
deprive 
nature 
of 
its 
particular 
and 
existing 
perfections 
— 
which 
would 
be 
in 
reality 
also 
not 
to 
sufficiently 
consider 
its 
order 
and 
harmony. 
There 
are 
besides 
many 
things 
in 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
single, 
universal 
spirit 
which 
cannot 
be 
maintained 
and 
involvedifficultiesmuchgreaterthan 
thoseofthecommon 
doctrine. 


Here 
are 
some 
of 
them: 
you 
see, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
the 
comparison 
with 
the 
wind 
which 
makes 
various 
pipes 
sound 
differently, 
flatters 
the 
imagination, 
but 
explains 
nothing, 
or 
rather 
implies 
exactly 
the 
contrary. 
For 
this 
universal 
breath 
of 
the 
pipes 
is 
only 
a 
collection 
of 
a 
quantity 
of 
separate 
breaths; 
moreover 
each 
pipe 
is 
filled 
with 
its 
own 
air 
which 
can 
even 
pass 
from 
one 
pipe 
to 
another, 
so 
that 
this 
comparison 
would 
establish 
rather 
individual 
souls, 
and 
would 
even 
favor 
the 
transmigration 
of 
souls 
from 
one 
bodyto 
another,astheaircanchangepipes. 


And 
if 
we 
imagine 
that 
the 
universal 
spirit 
is 
like 
an 
ocean, 
composed 
of 
innumerable 
drops, 
which 
are 
detached 
from 
it 
when 
they 
animate 
some 
particular 
organic 
body, 
but 
reunite 
themselves 
to 
the 
ocean 
after 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
organs, 
you 
again 
form 
a 
material 
and 
gross 
idea 
which 
does 
not 
suitthe 
subjectand 
becomes 
entangled 
in 
thesame 
difficulties 
asthe 
breath. 
For 
as 
the 
ocean 
is 
a 
collection 
of 
drops, 
God 
would 
likewise 
be 
an 
assembly 
ofall 
thesouls, 
justas 
a 
swarm 
ofbees 
is 
an 
assemblyof 
theselittle 



animals; 
but 
as 
this 
swarm 
is 
not 
itself 
a 
real 
substance, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
in 
this 
way 
the 
universal 
spirit 
would 
not 
be 
a 
true 
being 
itself, 
and 
instead 
of 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
the 
only 
spirit, 
we 
should 
have 
to 
say 
that 
it 
is 
nothing 
at 
all 
in 
itself, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
in 
nature 
only 
individual 
souls, 
of 
which 
it 
would 
be 
the 
mass. 
Moreover 
these 
drops, 
reunited 
to 
the 
ocean 
of 
the 
universal 
spirit 
after 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
organs, 
would 
be 
in 
reality 
souls 
which 
would 
exist 
separated 
from 
matter, 
and 
we 
should 
fall 
back 
again 
into 
what 
we 
wished 
to 
avoid, 
especially 
if 
these 
drops 
retain 
something 
of 
their 
preceding 
state, 
or 
have 
still 
some 
functions 
and 
could 
even 
acquire 
more 
sublime 
ones 
in 
the 
ocean 
of 
the 
divinity 
or 
of 
the 
universal 
spirit. 
For 
if 
you 
wish 
that 
these 
souls, 
reunited 
to 
God, 
be 
without 
any 
function 
of 
their 
own, 
you 
fall 
into 
an 
opinion 
contrary 
to 
reason 
and 
all 
sound 
philosophy, 
as 
if 
any 
existing 
being 
could 
ever 
reach 
a 
state 
where 
it 
would 
be 
without 
any 
function 
or 
impression. 
For 
one 
thing 
because 
it 
is 
joined 
to 
another 
does 
not 
therefore 
cease 
to 
have 
its 
own 
particular 
functions, 
which 
joined 
with 
those 
of 
the 
other, 
produce 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
whole. 
Otherwise 
the 
whole 
would 
have 
none, 
if 
the 
parte 
had 
none. 
Besides 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
proved 
that 
every 
being 
retains 
perfectly 
all 
the 
impressions 
it 
has 
received, 
although 
these 
impressions 
may 
not 
be 
perceptible 
singly, 
because 
they 
are 
joined 
with 
so 
many 
others. 
So 
the 
soul 
reunited 
to 
the 
ocean 
of 
souls, 
would 
always 
remain 
theparticularsoulithad 
beenwhile 
separated. 


This 
shows 
that 
it 
is 
more 
reasonable 
and 
more 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
custom 
of 
nature 
to 
allow 
individual 
souls 
to 
exist 
in 
the 
animals 
themselves, 
and 
not 
outside 
in 
God, 
and 
so 
to 
preserve 
not 
only 
the 
soul 
but 
also 
the 
animal,asI 
haveexplainedabove 
andelsewhere; 
andthustoallowindividual 
souls 
to 
remain 
always 
in 
activity, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
particular 
functions 
which 
are 
peculiar 
to 
them 
and 
which 
contribute 
to 
the 
beauty 
and 
order 
of 
the 
universe, 
instead 
of 
reducing 
them 
to 
the 
sabbath 
in 
God 
of 
the 
Quietists, 
that 



is 
to 
say, 
to 
a 
state 
of 
idleness 
and 
uselessness. 
For 
as 
far 
as 
the 
beatific 
vision 
of 
blessed 
souls 
is 
concerned, 
it 
is 
compatible 
with 
the 
functions 
of 
theirglorified 
bodies,whichwillnotceaseto 
be,intheir 
way,organic. 


But 
if 
some 
one 
wished 
to 
maintain 
that 
there 
are 
no 
individual 
souls, 
not 
even 
when 
the 
function 
of 
feeling 
and 
of 
thought 
takes 
place 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
organs, 
he 
would 
be 
refuted 
by 
our 
experience 
which 
teaches 
us, 
as 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
that 
we 
are 
a 
something 
in 
particular, 
which 
thinks, 
which 
perceives, 
which 
wills; 
and 
that 
we 
are 
distinct 
from 
another 
something 
which 
thinksandwhich 
willsotherthings. 


Otherwise 
we 
fall 
into 
the 
opinion 
of 
Spinoza, 
or 
of 
some 
other 
similar 
authors, 
who 
will 
have 
it 
that 
there 
is 
but 
one 
substance, 
namely 
God, 
which 
thinks, 
believes 
and 
wills 
one 
thing 
in 
me, 
but 
which 
thinks, 
believes 
and 
willsexactlythecontrary 
inanother; 
anopinionofwhichM. 
Bayle,incertain 
portionsofhisDictionary,haswellshownthe 
absurdity. 


Or, 
if 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
nature 
but 
the 
universal 
spirit 
and 
matter, 
we 
would 
have 
to 
say 
that 
if 
it 
is 
not 
the 
universal 
spirit 
itself 
which 
believes 
and 
wills 
opposite 
things 
in 
different 
persons, 
it 
is 
matter 
which 
is 
different 
and 
actsdifferently; 
but 
ifmatteracts,ofwhat 
useistheuniversalspirit? 
Ifmatter 
is 
nothing 
but 
an 
original 
passive 
substance, 
or 
a 
passive 
substance 
only, 
how 
can 
these 
actions 
be 
attributed 
to 
it? 
It 
is 
therefore 
much 
more 
reasonable 
to 
believe 
that 
besides 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
supreme 
activity, 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
individual 
active 
beings, 
since 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
particular 
and 
opposite 
actions 
and 
passions, 
which 
could 
not 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
same 
subject; 
and 
theseactivebeingsarethe 
individual 
souls. 


We 
know 
also 
that 
there 
are 
degrees 
in 
all 
things. 
There 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
degrees 
between 
any 
movement 
and 
perfect 
repose, 
between 
hardness 
and 
a 
perfect 
fluidity 
which 
is 
without 
any 
resistance, 
between 
God 
and 
nothingness. 
There 
is 
likewise 
an 
infinity 
of 
degrees 
between 
any 
active 



being 
whatsoever 
and 
a 
purely 
passive 
being. 
Consequently 
it 
is 
not 
reasonable 
to 
admit 
but 
one 
active 
being, 
namely 
the 
universal 
spirit, 
with 
a 
single 
passivebeing,namelymatter. 


It 
must 
also 
be 
considered 
that 
matter 
is 
not 
a 
thing 
opposed 
to 
God, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
rather 
opposed 
to 
the 
limited 
active 
being, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
soul 
or 
to 
form. 
ForGod 
fromwhommatter 
aswellas 
formcomesisthesupremebeing 
opposed 
to 
nothingness; 
and 
the 
purely 
passive 
is 
something 
more 
than 
nothingness, 
being 
capable 
of 
something, 
while 
nothing 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
nothingness. 
Thus 
with 
each 
particular 
portion 
of 
matter 
must 
be 
connected 
theparticularforms, 
—that 
is,souls 
andspirits, 
—whichbelongtoit. 


I 
do 
not 
wish 
here 
to 
recur 
to 
a 
demonstrative 
argument 
which 
I 
have 
employed 
elsewhere, 
and 
which 
is 
drawn 
from 
the 
unities 
or 
simple 
things, 
among 
which 
individual 
souls 
are 
included. 
For 
this 
unavoidably 
obliges 
us 
not 
only 
to 
admit 
individual 
souls, 
but 
also 
to 
avow 
that 
they 
are 
immortal 
by 
theirnature,and 
asindestructibleas 
theuniverse; 
and, 
whatismore, 
thateach 
soul 
is 
in 
itswayamirrorof 
theuniverse,without 
any 
interruption, 
and 
that 
it 
contains 
in 
its 
depths 
an 
order 
corresponding 
to 
that 
of 
the 
universe 
itself. 
The 
souls 
diversify 
and 
represent 
the 
universe 
in 
an 
infinity 
of 
ways, 
all 
different 
and 
all 
true, 
and 
multiply 
it, 
so 
to 
speak, 
as 
many 
times 
as 
is 
possible, 
so 
that 
in 
this 
way 
they 
approach 
divinity 
as 
much 
as 
is 
possible, 
accordingtotheir 
different 
degrees, 
and 
give 
to 
the 
universe 
all 
the 
perfection 
ofwhichit 
iscapable. 


After 
this, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
on 
what 
reason 
or 
probability 
the 
doctrine 
of 
individual 
souls 
can 
be 
combated. 
Those 
who 
do 
so, 
admit 
that 
what 
is 
in 
us 
is 
an 
effect 
of 
the 
universal 
spirit. 
But 
the 
effects 
of 
God 
are 
subsistent, 
not 
to 
say 
that 
even 
the 
modifications 
and 
effects 
of 
creatures 
are 
in 
a 
way 
durable, 
and 
that 
their 
impressions 
only 
unite 
without 
being 
destroyed. 
Therefore, 
if 
in 
accordance 
with 
reason 
and 
experience, 
as 
we 
have 
shown, 
the 
animal, 
with 



its 
more 
or 
less 
distinct 
perceptions 
and 
with 
certain 
organs, 
always 
subsists, 
and 
if 
consequently 
this 
effect 
of 
God 
subsists 
always 
in 
these 
organs, 
why 
would 
it 
not 
be 
permissible 
to 
call 
it 
the 
soul, 
and 
to 
say 
that 
this 
effect 
of 
God 
is 
a 
soul, 
immaterial 
and 
immortal, 
which 
imitates 
in 
a 
way 
the 
universal 
spirit? 
Since 
this 
doctrine, 
moreover, 
does 
away 
with 
all 
difficulties, 
as 
appears 
by 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said 
here 
and

ON 
THE 
SUPERSENSIBLE 
ELEMENT 
IN 
KNOWLEDGE, 
AND 
ON 
THE 
IMMATERIAL 
IN 
NATURE: 
A 
LETTERTO 


QUEEN 
CHARLOTTE 
OF 
PRUSSIA, 
1702. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



MADAME: 


The 
letter 
written 
not 
long 
since 
from 
Paris 
to 
Osnabrück 
and 
which 
I 
recently 
read, 
by 
your 
order, 
at 
Hanover, 
seemed 
to 
me 
truly 
ingenious 
and 
beautiful. 
And 
as 
it 
treats 
of 
the 
two 
important 
questions, 
Whether 
there 
is 
something 
in 
our 
thoughts 
which 
does 
not 
come 
from 
the 
senses, 
and 
Whether 
there 
is 
something 
in 
nature 
which 
is 
not 
material, 
concerning 
which 
I 
acknowledge 
thatIamnotaltogetheroftheopinionoftheauthor 
oftheletter, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
able 
to 
explain 
myself 
with 
the 
same 
grace 
as 
‘he, 
in 
order 
toobey 
the 
commandsandtosatisfy 
the 
curiosityofyourMajesty. 


We 
use 
the 
external 
senses 
as, 
to 
use 
the 
comparison 
of 
one 
of 
the 
ancients, 
a 
blind 
man 
does 
a 
stick, 
and 
they 
make 
us 
know 
their 
particular 
objects 
which 
are 
colors, 
sounds, 
odors, 
flavors, 
and 
the 
qualities 
of 
touch, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
make 
us 
know 
what 
these 
sensible 
qualities 
are 
nor 
in 
what 
they 
consist. 
For 
example, 
whether 
red 
is 
the 
revolving 
of 
certain 
small 
globules 
which 
it 
is 
claimed 
cause 
light, 
whether 
heat 
is 
the 
whirling 
of 
a 
very 
fine 
dust, 
whether 
sound 
is 
made 
in 
the 
air 
as 
circles 
in 
the 
water 
when 
a 
stone 
is 
thrown 
into 
it, 
as 
certain 
philosophers 
claim; 
this 
is 
what 
we 
do 
not 
see. 
And 
we 
could 
not 
even 
understand 
how 
this 
revolving, 
these 
whirlings 
and 
these 
circles 
if 
they 
should 
be 
real 
should 
cause 
exactly 
these 
perceptions 
which 
we 
have 
of 
red, 
of 
heat, 
of 
noise. 
Thus 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
sensible 
qualities 
are 
in 
fact 
occult 
qualities, 
and 
that 
there 
must 
be 
others 
more 



manifest 
which 
can 
render 
the 
former 
more 
explicable. 
And 
far 
from 
understanding 
only 
sensible 
things, 
it 
is 
exactly 
these 
which 
we 
understand 
the 
least. 
And 
although 
they 
are 
familiar 
to 
us 
we 
do 
not 
understand 
them 
the 
better 
for 
that; 
as 
a 
pilot 
understands 
no 
better 
than 
another 
person 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
magnetic 
needle 
which 
turns 
toward 
the 
north, 
although 
he 
has 
it 
always 
before 
his 
eyes 
in 
the 
compass, 
and 
although 
he 
does 
not 
admire 
it 
any 
the 
more 
for 
thatreason. 


I 
do 
not 
deny 
that 
many 
discoveries 
have 
been 
made 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
occult 
qualities, 
as, 
for 
example, 
we 
know 
by 
what 
kind 
of 
refraction 
blue 
and 
yellow 
are 
formed, 
and 
that 
these 
two 
colors 
mixed 
form 
green; 
but 
for 
all 
this 
we 
cannot 
yet 
understand 
how 
the 
perception 
which 
we 
have 
of 
these 
three 
colors 
results 
from 
these 
causes. 
Also 
we 
have 
not 
even 
nominal 
definitions 
of 
such 
qualities 
by 
which 
to 
explain 
terms. 
The 
purpose 
of 
nominal 
definitions 
is 
to 
give 
sufficient 
marks 
by 
which 
the 
thing 
may 
be 
recognized; 
for 
example, 
assayers 
have 
marks 
by 
which 
they 
distinguish 
gold 
from 
every 
other 
metal, 
and 
even 
if 
a 
man 
had 
never 
seen 
gold 
these 
signs 
might 
be 
taught 
him 
so 
that 
he 
would 
infallibly 
recognize 
it 
if 
he 
should 
some 
day 
meet 
with 
it. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
these 
sensible 
qualities, 
and 
marks 
to 
recognize 
blue, 
for 
example, 
could 
not 
be 
given 
if 
we 
had 
never 
seen 
it. 
So 
that 
blue 
is 
its 
own 
mark, 
and 
in 
order 
that 
a 
man 
may 
know 
what 
blueisit 
mustnecessarilybeshowntohim. 


It 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
say 
that 
the 
notions 
of 
these 
qualities 
are 
clear, 
for 
they 
serve 
to 
recognize 
them; 
but 
that 
these 
same 
notions 
are 
not 
distinct, 
because 
we 
cannot 
distinguish 
nor 
develope 
that 
which 
they 
include. 
It 
is 
I 
know 
not 
what 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious, 
but 
for 
which 
we 
cannot 
account. 
Whereas 
we 
can 
make 
another 
understand 
what 
a 
thing 
is 
of 
which 
we 
have 
some 
description 
or 
nominal 
definition, 
even 
although 
we 
should 
not 
have 
the 
thing 
itself 
at 
hand 
to 
show 
him. 
However 



we 
must 
do 
the 
senses 
the 
justice 
to 
say 
that, 
in 
addition 
to 
these 
occult 
qualities, 
they 
make 
us 
know 
other 
qualities 
which 
are 
more 
manifest 
and 
which 
furnish 
more 
distinct 
notions. 
And 
these 
are 
those 
which 
we 
ascribe 
to 
common 
sense, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
external 
sense 
to 
which 
they 
are 
particularly 
attached 
and 
belong. 
And 
here 
definitions 
of 
the 
terms 
or 
words 
employed 
may 
be 
given. 
Such 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
numbers, 
which 
is 
found 
equally 
in 
sounds, 
colors, 
and 
touches. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
we 
perceive 
also 
figures, 
which 
are 
common 
to 
colors 
and 
to 
touches, 
but 
which 
we 
do 
not 
notice 
in 
sounds. 
Although 
it 
is 
true 
that 
in 
order 
to 
conceive 
distinctly 
numbers 
and 
even 
figures, 
and 
to 
form 
sciences 
of 
them, 
we 
must 
come 
to 
something 
which 
the 
senses 
cannotfurnish,andwhichthe 
understandingaddsto 
the 
senses. 


As 
therefore 
our 
soul 
compares 
(for 
example) 
the 
numbers 
and 
figures 
which 
are 
in 
colors 
with 
the 
numbers 
and 
figures 
which 
are 
found 
by 
the 
touch, 
there 
must 
be 
an 
internal 
sense, 
in 
which 
the 
perceptions 
of 
these 
different 
external 
senses 
are 
found 
united. 
This 
is 
what 
is 
called 
the 
imagination, 
which 
comprises 
at 
once 
the 
notions 
of 
the 
particular, 
whichare 
clear 
but 
confused, 
and 
the 
notions 
of 
the 
common 
sense, 
which 
are 
clear 
and 
distinct. 
And 
these 
clear 
and 
distinct 
ideas 
which 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
imagination 
are 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
mathematical 
sciences, 
namely 
of 
arithmetic 
and 
geometry, 
which 
are 
pure 
mathematical 
sciences, 
and 
of 
the 
application 
of 
these 
sciences 
to 
nature, 
forming 
mixed 
mathematics. 
It 
is 
evident 
also 
that 
particular 
sensible 
qualities 
are 
susceptible 
of 
explanations 
and 
of 
reasonings 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
involve 
what 
is 
common 
to 
the 
objects 
of 
several 
external 
senses, 
and 
belong 
to 
the 
internal 
sense. 
For 
those 
who 
try 
to 
explain 
sensible 
qualities 
distinctly 
always 
have 
recourse 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
mathematics, 
and 
these 
ideas 
involve 
size 
or 
multitude 
of 
parts. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
mathematical 
sciences 
would 
not 
be 
demonstrative, 
and 
would 
consist 
in 
a 
simple 
induction 
or 
observation, 
which 
would 
never 
assure 
us 
of 



theperfect 
generality 
of 
thetruths 
therefound, 
if 
somethinghigherand 
which 
intelligence 
alone 
can 
furnish 
did 
not 
come 
to 
the 
aid 
of 
the 
imagination 
and 
the 
senses. 


There 
are, 
therefore, 
objects 
of 
still 
other 
nature, 
which 
are 
not 
included 
at 
allinwhat 
is 
observed 
inthe 
objectsof 
thesensesinparticular 
orin 
common, 
and 
which 
consequently 
are 
not 
objects 
of 
the 
imagination 
either. 
Thus 
besides 
the 
sensible 
and 
imageable, 
there 
is 
that 
which 
is 
purely 
intelligible, 
as 
being 
the 
object 
of 
the 
understanding 
atone, 
and 
such 
is 
the 
object 
of 
my 
thought 
when 
I 
think 
of 
myself 
This 
thought 
of 
the 
Ego, 
which 
perceives 
sensible 
objects, 
and 
of 
my 
own 
action 
resulting 
therefrom, 
adds 
something 
to 
the 
objects 
of 
the 
senses. 
To 
think 
a 
color 
and 
to 
observe 
that 
one 
thinks 
it, 
are 
two 
very 
different 
thoughts, 
as 
different 
as 
the 
color 
is 
from 
the 
Ego 
which 
thinks 
it. 
Andas 
Iconceive 
that 
otherbeingsmay 
also 
have 
the 
right 
to 
say 
I, 
or 
that 
it 
could 
be 
said 
for 
them, 
it 
is 
through 
this 
that 
I 
conceive 
what 
is 
called 
substance 
in 
general, 
and 
it 
is 
also 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
Ego 
itself 
which 
furnishes 
other 
metaphysical 
notions, 
as 
cause, 
effect, 
action, 
similarity, 
etc. 
and 
even 
those 
of 
logic 
and 
of 
ethics. 
Thus 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
the 
understanding 
which 
does 
not 
come 
from 
the 
senses, 
excepttheunderstandingitself, 
orthat 
whichunderstands. 


There 
are 
then 
three 
grades 
of 
notions: 
the 
simply 
sensible, 
which 
are 
the 
objects 
appropriate 
to 
each 
sense 
in 
particular; 
the 
sensible 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
intelligible, 
which 
pertain 
to 
the 
common 
sense; 
and 
the 
simply 
intelligible, 
which 
belong 
to 
the 
understanding. 
The 
first 
and 
the 
second 
are 
both 
imageable, 
but 
the 
third 
are 
above 
the 
imagination. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
are 
intelligible 
and 
distinct; 
but 
the 
first 
are 
confused, 
although 
they 
are 
clear 
orrecognizable. 


Being 
itself 
and 
truth 
are 
not 
known 
wholly 
through 
the 
senses, 
for 
it 
would 
not 
be 
impossible 
for 
a 
creature 
to 
have 
long 
and 
orderly 
dreams, 



resembling 
our 
life, 
of 
such 
a 
sort 
that 
everything 
which 
it 
thought 
it 
perceived 
through 
the 
senses 
would 
be 
but 
a 
mere 
appearance. 
There 
must 
therefore 
be 
something 
beyond 
the 
senses, 
which 
distinguishes 
the 
true 
from 
theapparent. 
But 
thetruth 
of 
the 
demonstrative 
sciences 
is 
exemptfrom 
these 
doubts, 
and 
must 
even 
serve 
for 
judging 
of 
the 
truth 
of 
sensible 
things. 
For 
as 
able 
philosophers, 
ancient 
and 
modern, 
have 
already 
well 
remarked: 
— 
if 
all 
that 
I 
should 
think 
that 
I 
see 
should 
be 
but 
a 
dream, 
it 
would 
always 
be 
true 
that 
I 
who 
think 
while 
dreaming, 
would 
be 
something, 
and 
would 
actually 
thinkin 
manyways, 
for 
whichtheremustalways 
besomereason. 


Thus 
what 
the 
ancient 
Platonists 
have 
observed 
is 
very 
true, 
and 
is 
very 
worthy 
of 
being 
considered, 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
sensible 
things 
and 
particularly 
of 
the 
Ego 
which 
thinks 
and 
which 
is 
called 
spirit 
or 
soul, 
is 
incomparably 
more 
sure 
than 
the 
existence 
of 
sensible 
things; 
and 
that 
thus 
it 
would 
not 
be 
impossible, 
speaking 
with 
metaphysical 
rigor, 
that 
there 
should 
be 
at 
bottom 
only 
these 
intelligible 
substances, 
and 
that 
sensible 
things 
should 
be 
but 
appearances. 
While 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
our 
lack 
of 
attention 
makes 
us 
take 
sensible 
things 
for 
the 
only 
true 
things. 
It 
is 
well 
also 
to 
observe 
that 
if 
I 
should 
discover 
any 
demonstrative 
truth, 
mathematical 
or 
otherwise, 
while 
dreaming 
(as 
might 
in 
fact 
be), 
it 
would 
be 
just 
as 
certain 
as 
if 
I 
had 
been 
awake. 
This 
shows 
us 
how 
intelligible 
truth 
is 
independent 
of 
thetruthorofthe 
existenceoutsideofus 
ofsensibleand 
materialthings. 


This 
conception 
of 
being 
and 
of 
truth 
is 
found 
therefore 
in 
the 
Ego 
and 
in 
the 
understanding, 
rather 
than 
in 
the 
external 
senses 
and 
in 
the 
perception 
of 
exterior 
objects. 


There 
we 
find 
also 
what 
it 
is 
to 
affirm, 
to 
deny, 
to 
doubt, 
to 
will, 
to 
act. 
But 
above 
all 
we 
find 
there 
the 
force 
of 
the 
consequences 
of 
reasoning, 
which 
are 
a 
part 
of 
what 
is 
called 
the 
natural 
light. 
For 
example, 
from 
this 
premise, 
that 
no 
wise 
man 
is 
wicked, 
we 
may, 
by 
reversing 
the 
terms, 
draw 
this 



conclusion, 
that 
no 
wicked 
man 
is 
wise. 
Whereas 
from 
this 
sentence, 
that 
every 
wise 
man 
is 
praiseworthy, 
we 
cannot 
conclude 
by 
reversing 
it, 
that 
every 
one 
praiseworthy 
is 
wise 
but 
only 
that 
some 
praiseworthy 
ones 
are 
wise. 
Although 
we 
may 
always 
reverse 
particular 
affirmative 
propositions, 
for 
example, 
if 
some 
wise 
man 
is 
rich 
it 
must 
also 
he 
that 
some 
rich 
men 
are 
wise, 
this 
cannot 
he 
done 
in 
particular 
negatives. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
say 
that 
there 
are 
charitable 
persons 
who 
are 
not 
just, 
which 
happens 
when 
charity 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
regulated; 
but 
we 
cannot 
infer 
from 
this 
that 
there 
are 
just 
persons 
who 
are 
not 
charitable; 
for 
in 
justice 
are 
included 
at 
the 
sametimecharityandtheruleofreason. 


It 
is 
also 
by 
this 
natural 
light 
that 
the 
axioms 
of 
mathematics 
are 
recognized; 
for 
example, 
that 
if 
from 
two 
equal 
things 
the 
same 
quantity 
he 
taken 
away 
the 
things 
which 
remain 
are 
equal; 
likewise 
that 
if 
in 
a 
balance 
everything 
is 
equal 
on 
the 
one 
side 
and 
on 
the 
other, 
neither 
will 
incline, 
a 
thing 
which 
we 
foresee 
without 
ever 
having 
experienced 
it. 
It 
is 
upon 
such 
foundations 
that 
we 
establish 
arithmetic, 
geometry, 
mechanics 
and 
the 
other 
demonstrative 
sciences, 
in 
which, 
in 
truth, 
the 
senses 
are 
very 
necessary, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
certain 
ideas 
of 
sensible 
things, 
and 
experiences 
are 
necessary 
to 
establish 
certain 
facts, 
and 
even 
useful 
to 
verify 
reasonings 
as 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
proof. 
But 
the 
force 
of 
the 
demonstrations 
depends 
upon 
intelligible 
notions 
and 
truths, 
which 
alone 
are 
capable 
of 
making 
us 
discern 
what 
is 
necessary, 
and 
which, 
in 
the 
conjectural 
sciences, 
are 
even 
capable 
of 
determining 
demonstratively 
the 
degree 
of 
probability, 
concerning 
certain 
given 
suppositions, 
in 
order 
that 
we 
may 
choose 
rationally 
among 
opposite 
appearances, 
the 
one 
which 
is 
greatest. 
Nevertheless 
this 
part 
of 
the 
art 
of 
reasoninghasnotyetbeencultivatedasmuchasitoughttobe. 


But 
to 
return 
to 
necessary 
truths, 
it 
is 
universally 
true 
that 
we 
know 
them 
only 
by 
this 
natural 
light, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
by 
the 
experiences 
of 
the 
senses. 
For 



the 
senses 
can 
very 
well 
make 
known 
in 
some 
way 
what 
is, 
but 
they 
cannot 
makeknownwhat 
ought 
to 
be 
orcouldnotbeotherwise. 


For 
example, 
although 
we 
may 
have 
experienced 
numberless 
times 
that 
every 
massive 
body 
tends 
toward 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
is 
not 
sustained 
in 
the 
air, 
we 
are 
not 
sure 
that 
this 
is 
necessary 
as 
long 
as 
we 
do 
not 
understand 
the 
reason 
of 
it. 
Thus 
we 
could 
not 
be 
sure 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
would 
occurin 
air 
atahigheraltitude, 
at 
a 
hundred 
or 
moreleagues 
above 
us, 
and 
there 
are 
philosophers 
who 
imagine 
that 
the 
earth 
is 
a 
magnet, 
and 
as 
the 
ordinary 
magnet 
does 
not 
attract 
the 
needle 
when 
a 
little 
removed 
from 
it, 
they 
think 
that 
the 
attractive 
force 
of 
the 
earth 
dues 
not 
extend 
very 
far 
either. 
I 
do 
not 
say 
that 
they 
are 
right, 
but 
I 
do 
say 
that 
one 
cannot 
go 
very 
certainly 
beyondtheexperienceshehashad,if 
heisnotaidedbyreason. 



This 
is 
why 
the 
geometricians 
have 
always 
considered 
that 
what 
is 
only 
proved 
by 
induction 
or 
by 
examples 
in 
geometry 
or 
in 
arithmetic, 
is 
never 
perfectly 
proved. 
For 
example, 
experience 
teaches 
us 
that 
odd 
numbers 
continuously 
added 
together 
produce 
the 
square 
numbers, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
those 
which 
come 
from 
multiplying 
a 
number 
by 
itself. 
Thus 
1 
and 
3 
make 
4, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
2 
times 
2, 
and 
1 
and 
3 
and 
5 
make 
9, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
3 
times 
3. 
And 
1 
and 
3 
and 
5 
and 
7 
make 
16, 
that 
is 
4 
times 
4. 
And 
1 
and 
3 
and 
5 
and 
7 
and 
9 
make25,thatis5times5. 
And 
soon. 


However, 
if 
one 
should 
experience 
it 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
times, 
continuing 
the 
calculation 
very 
far, 
he 
may 
reasonably 
think 
that 
this 
will 



always 
follow; 
but 
we 
do 
not 
therefore 
have 
absolute 
certainty 
of 
it, 
unless 
we 
learn 
the 
demonstrative 
reason 
which 
the 
mathematicians 
found 
out 
long 
ago. 
And 
it 
is 
on 
this 
foundation 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
inductions, 
but 
carried 
a 
little 
too 
far, 
that 
an 
Englishman 
has 
lately 
wished 
to 
maintain 
that 
we 
can 
avoid 
death. 
For 
(said 
he) 
the 
consequence 
is 
not 
good, 
my 
father, 
my 
grandfather, 
my 
great-grandfather 
are 
dead 
and 
all 
the 
others 
who 
have 
lived 
before 
us; 
therefore 
we 
shall 
also 
die. 
For 
their 
death 
has 
no 
influence 
on 
us. 
The 
trouble 
is 
that 
we 
resemble 
them 
a 
little 
too 
much 
in 
this 
respect 
that 
the 
causes 
of 
their 
death 
subsist 
also 
in 
us. 
For 
the 
resemblance 
would 
not 
suffice 
todrawsureconsequenceswithouttheconsideration 
ofthesamereasons. 


In 
truth 
there 
are 
experiments 
which 
succeed 
numberless 
times 
and 
ordinarily, 
and 
yet 
it 
is 
found 
in 
some 
extraordinary 
cases 
that 
there 
are 
instances 
where 
the 
experiment 
does 
not 
succeed. 
For 
example, 
if 
we 
should 
have 
found 
a 
thousand 
times 
that 
iron 
put 
all 
alone 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
water 
goes 
to 
the 
bottom, 
we 
are 
not 
sure 
that 
this 
must 
always 
happen. 
And 
without 
recurring 
to 
the 
miracle 
of 
the 
prophet 
Elisha 
who 
made 
the 
iron 
float, 
we 
know 
that 
an 
iron 
pot 
may 
he 
made 
so 
hollow 
that 
it 
floats, 
and 
that 
it 
can 
even 
carry 
besides 
a 
considerable 
weight, 
as 
do 
boats 
of 
copper 
or 
of 
tin. 
And 
even 
the 
abstract 
sciences 
like 
geometry 
furnish 
cases 
in 
which 
what 
ordinarily 
occurs 
no 
longer. 
For 
example, 
we 
ordinarily 
find 
that 
two 
lines 
which 
continually 
approach 
each 
other 
finally 
meet, 
and 
many 
people 
will 
almost 
swear 
that 
this 
could 
never 
be 
otherwise. 
And 
nevertheless 
geometry 
furnishes 
us 
with 
extraordinary 
lines, 
which 
are 
for 
this 
reason 
called 
asymptotes, 
which 
prolonged 
ad 
infinitum 
continually 
approach 
each 
other, 
and 
nevertheless 
nevermeet. 


This 
consideration 
shows 
also 
that 
there 
is 
a 
light 
born 
with 
us. 
For 
since 
the 
senses 
and 
inductions 
could 
never 
teach 
us 
truths 
which 
are 
thoroughly 
universal, 
nor 
that 
which 
is 
absolutely 
necessary, 
but 
only 
that 
which 
is, 
and 



that 
which 
is 
found 
in 
particular 
examples; 
and 
since 
we 
nevertheless 
know 
necessary 
and 
universal 
truths 
of 
the 
sciences, 
a 
privilege 
which 
we 
have 
above 
the 
brutes; 
it 
follows 
that 
we 
have 
derived 
these 
truths 
in 
part 
from 
what 
is 
within 
us. 
Thus 
we 
may 
lead 
a 
child 
to 
these 
by 
simple 
interrogations, 
after 
the 
manner 
of 
Socrates, 
without 
telling 
him 
anything, 
and 
without 
making 
him 
experiment 
at 
all 
upon 
the 
truth 
of 
what 
is 
asked 
him. 
And 
this 
couldveryeasilybepractisedin 
numbersandothersimilar,matters. 


I 
agree, 
nevertheless, 
that 
in 
the 
present 
state 
the 
external 
senses 
are 
necessary 
to 
us 
for 
thinking, 
and 
that, 
if 
we 
had 
none, 
we 
could 
not 
think. 
But 
that 
which 
is 
necessary 
for 
something 
does 
not 
for 
all 
that 
constitute 
its 
essence. 
Air 
is 
necessary 
for 
life, 
but 
life 
is 
something 
else 
than 
air. 
The 
senses 
furnish 
us 
the 
matter 
for 
reasoning, 
and 
we 
never 
have 
thoughts 
so 
abstract 
that 
something 
from 
the 
senses 
is 
not 
mingled 
therewith; 
but 
reasoningrequiressomething 
elsein 
additionto 
whatisfromthesenses. 


As 
to 
the 
second 
question, 
whether 
there 
are 
immaterial 
substances, 
in 
order 
to 
solve 
it, 
it 
is 
first 
necessary 
to 
explain 
one’s 
self. 
Hitherto 
by 
matter 
has 
been 
understood 
that 
which 
includes 
only 
notions 
purely 
passive 
and 
indifferent, 
namely, 
extension 
and 
impenetrability, 
which 
need 
to 
be 
determined 
by 
something 
else 
to 
some 
form 
or 
action. 
Thus 
when 
it 
is 
said 
that 
there 
are 
immaterial 
substances, 
it 
is 
thereby 
meant 
that 
there 
are 
substances 
which 
include 
other 
notions, 
namely, 
perception 
and 
the 
principle 
of 
action 
or 
of 
change, 
which 
could 
not 
be 
explained 
either 
by 
extension 
or 
by 
impenetrability. 
These 
beings, 
when 
they 
have 
feeling, 
are 
called 
souls, 
and 
when 
they 
are 
capable 
of 
reason, 
they 
are 
called 
spirits. 
Thus 
if 
one 
says 
that 
force 
and 
perception 
are 
essential 
to 
matter 
he 
takes 
matter 
for 
corporeal 
substance 
which 
is 
complete, 
which 
includes 
form 
and 
matter, 
or 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
organs. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
it 
were 
said 
that 
there 
were 
souls 
everywhere. 
This 
might 
be 
true, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
contrary 
to 
the 
doctrine 
of 
immaterial 



substances. 
For 
it 
is 
not 
intended 
that 
these 
souls 
be 
outside 
of 
matter, 
but 
simply 
that 
they 
are 
something 
more 
than 
matter, 
and 
are 
not 
produced 
nor 
destroyed 
by 
the 
changes 
which 
matter 
undergoes, 
nor 
subject 
to 
dissolution, 
sincetheyarenotcomposedofparts. 


Nevertheless 
itmustbe 
avowed 
alsothat 
there 
is 
substance 
separated 
from 
matter. 
And 
to 
see 
this, 
one 
has 
only 
to 
consider 
that 
there 
are 
numberless 
forms 
which 
matter 
might 
have 
received 
in 
place 
of 
the 
series 
of 
variations 
which 
it 
has 
actually 
received. 
For 
it 
is 
clear, 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
stars 
could 
move 
quite 
otherwise, 
space 
and 
matter 
being 
indifferent 
to 
every 
kind 
of 
motionandfigure. 


Hence 
the 
reason 
or 
universal 
determining 
cause 
whereby 
things 
are, 
and 
are 
as 
they 
are 
rather 
than 
otherwise, 
must 
be 
outside 
of 
matter. 
And 
even 
the 
existence 
of 
matter 
depends 
thereon, 
since 
we 
do 
not 
find 
in 
its 
notion 
that 
it 
carrieswithitthereasonof 
itsexistence. 


Now 
this 
ultimate 
reason 
of 
things, 
which 
is 
common 
to 
them 
all 
and 
universal 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
connection 
existing 
between 
all 
parts 
of 
nature, 
is 
what 
we 
call 
God, 
who 
must 
necessarily 
be 
an 
infinite 
and 
absolutely 
perfect 
substance. 
I 
am 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
all 
immaterial 
finite 
substances 
(even 
the 
genii 
or 
angels 
according 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
ancient 
Church 
Fathers) 
are 
united 
to 
organs, 
and 
accompany 
matter, 
and 
even 
that 
souls 
or 
active 
forms 
are 
everywhere 
found 
in 
it. 
And 
matter, 
in 
order 
to 
constitute 
a 
substance 
which 
is 
complete, 
cannot 
do 
without 
them, 
since 
force 
and 
action 
are 
found 
everywhere 
in 
it, 
and 
since 
the 
laws 
of 
force 
depend 
on 
certain 
remarkable 
metaphysical 
reasons 
or 
intelligible 
notions, 
without 
being 
explicable 
by 
notions 
merely 
material 
or 
mathematical, 
or 
which 
belong 
to 
thesphereof 
the 
imagination. 


Perception 
also 
could 
not 
be 
explained 
by 
any 
mechanism 
whatsoever. 
We 
may 
therefore 
conclude 
that 
there 
is 
in 
addition 
something 
immaterial 



everywhere 
in 
these 
creatures, 
and 
particularly 
in 
us, 
in 
whom 
this 
force 
is 
accompanied 
by 
a 
sufficiently 
distinct 
perception, 
and 
even 
by 
that 
light, 
of 
which 
I 
have 
spoken 
above, 
which 
makes 
us 
resemble 
in 
miniature 
the 
Divinity, 
as 
well 
by 
knowledge 
of 
the 
order, 
as 
by 
the 
ordering 
which 
we 
ourselves 
know 
how 
to 
give 
to 
the 
things 
which 
are 
within 
our 
reach, 
in 
imitation 
of 
that 
which 
God 
gives 
to 
the 
universe. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
also 
that 
our 
virtue 
and 
perfection 
consist, 
as 
our 
felicity 
consists 
in 
the 
pleasure 
which 
we 
taketherein. 


And 
since 
every 
time 
we 
penetrate 
into 
the 
depths 
of 
things, 
we 
find 
there 
the 
most 
beautiful 
order 
we 
could 
wish, 
even 
surpassing 
what 
we 
have 
therein 
imagined, 
as 
all 
those 
know 
who 
have 
fathomed 
the 
sciences; 
we 
may 
conclude 
that 
it 
is 
the 
same 
in 
all 
the 
rest, 
and 
that 
not 
only 
immaterial 
substances 
subsist 
always, 
but 
also 
that 
their 
lives, 
progress 
and 
changes 
are 
regulated 
for 
advance 
toward 
a 
certain 
end, 
or 
rather 
to 
approach 
more 
and 
more 
thereto, 
as 
do 
the 
asymptotes. 
And 
although 
we 
sometimes 
recoil, 
like 
lineswhichretrograde, 
advancementnonethelessfinallyprevailsand 
wins. 


The 
natural 
light 
of 
reason 
does 
not 
suffice 
for 
knowing 
the 
detail 
thereof, 
and 
our 
experiences 
are 
still 
too 
limited 
to 
catch 
a 
glimpse 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
this 
order. 
The 
revealed 
light 
guides 
us 
meanwhile 
through 
faith, 
but 
there 
is 
room 
to 
believe 
that 
in 
the 
course 
of 
time 
we 
shall 
know 
them 
even 
more 
by 
experience, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
spirits 
which 
know 
them 
already 
more 
than 
we 
do. 


Meanwhile 
the 
philosophers 
and 
the 
poets, 
for 
want 
of 
this, 
have 
betaken 
themselves 
to 
the 
fictions 
of 
metempsychosis 
or 
of 
the 
Elysian 
Fields, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
some 
ideas 
which 
might 
strike 
the 
populace. 
But 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
perfection 
of 
things 
or 
(what 
is 
the 
same 
thing) 
of 
the 
sovereign 
power, 
wisdom 
and 
goodness 
of 
God, 
who 
does 
all 
for 
the 
best, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
greatest 
order, 
suffices 
to 
render 
content 
those 
who 
are 



reasonable, 
and 
to 
make 
us 
believe 
that 
the 
contentment 
ought 
to 
be 
greater,

AN 
EXPLANATION 
OF 
CERTAIN 
POINTS 
IN 
HIS 
PHILOSOPHY: 
AN 
EXTRACTFROM 
A 
LETTER 
TO 
LADY 
MASHAM. 
1704. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



AS 
I 
AM 
altogether 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
uniformity, 
which 
I 
think 
nature 
observes 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
things 
while 
it 
varies 
in 
ways, 
degrees 
and 
perfections, 
my 
whole 
hypothesis 
amounts 
to 
recognizing 
in 
substances 
which 
are 
removed 
from 
our 
view 
and 
observation, 
something 
parallel 
to 
what 
appears 
in 
those 
which 
are 
within 
our 
reach. 
Thus, 
taking 
now 
for 
grantedthatthere 
is 
in 
us 
a 
simple 
being 
endowed 
with 
action 
and 
perception, 
I 
think 
that 
nature 
would 
be 
little 
connected, 
if 
this 
particle 
of 
matter 
which 
forms 
human 
bodies 
were 
alone 
endowed 
with 
that 
which 
would 
make 
it 
infinitely 
different 
from 
the 
rest 
(even 
in 
physics) 
and 
altogether 
heterogeneous 
inrelation 
to 
allother 
known 
bodies. 
This 
makes 
methink 
that 
there 
are 
everywhere 
present 
such 
active 
beings 
in 
matter, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
between 
them 
except 
in 
the 
manner 
of 
perception. 
And 
as 
our 
own 
perceptionsaresometimes 
accompaniedby 
reflection 
and 
sometimes 
not, 
and 
as 
from 
reflection 
come 
abstractions 
and 
universal 
and 
necessary 
truths, 
no 
traces 
of 
which 
are 
to 
be 
seen 
in 
brutes 
and 
still 
less 
in 
the 
other 
bodies 
which 
surround 
us, 
there 
is 
reason 
for 
believing 
that 
this 
simple 
being 
which 
is 
in 
us 
and 
which 
is 
called 
soul 
is 
distinguished 
by 
this 
from 
those 
of 
other 
known 
bodies. 


Whether 
now 
these 
principles 
of 
action 
and 
of 
perception 
be 
called 
FORMS, 
ENTELECHIES, 
SOULS, 
SPIRITS, 
or 
whether 
these 
terms 
be 
distinguished 
according 
to 
the 
notions 
one 
would 
like 
to 
attribute 
to 
them, 
the 



things 
will 
not 
thereby 
be 
changed. 
You 
will 
ask 
what 
these 
simple 
beings 
or 
these 
souls 
which 
I 
place 
in 
brutes 
and 
in 
the 
other 
creatures 
as 
far 
as 
they 
are 
organic, 
will 
become; 
I 
reply, 
that 
they 
must 
not 
be 
less 
inextinguishable 
than 
our 
souls, 
and 
that 
they 
cannot 
be 
produced 
or 
destroyed 
by 
the 
forces 
of 
nature. 


But 
further, 
to 
preserve 
the 
analogy 
of 
the 
future 
or 
past 
as 
well 
as 
of 
other 
bodies 
with 
what 
we 
experience 
at 
present 
in 
our 
bodies, 
I 
hold 
that 
not 
only 
these 
souls 
or 
entelechies 
all 
have 
a 
sort 
of 
organic 
body 
with 
them 
proportioned 
to 
their 
perceptions 
but 
also 
that 
they 
will 
always 
have 
one, 
and 
have 
always 
had 
one, 
as 
long 
as 
they 
have 
existed; 
so 
that 
not 
only 
the 
soul 
but 
also 
the 
animal 
itself 
(or 
that 
which 
is 
analogous 
to 
soul 
and 
animal, 
not 
to 
dispute 
about 
names) 
remains. 
And 
that 
thus 
generation 
and 
death 
can 
only 
be 
developments 
and 
envelopments, 
some 
examples 
of 
which 
nature, 
according 
to 
its 
custom, 
shows 
us 
visibly 
to 
aid 
us 
in 
divining 
that 
which 
is 
hidden. 
And 
consequently 
neither 
iron 
nor 
fire 
nor 
any 
other 
violences 
of 
nature, 
whatever 
ravages 
they 
may 
make 
in 
the 
body 
of 
an 
animal, 
can 
prevent 
the 
soul 
from 
preserving 
a 
certain 
organic 
body, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
ORGANISM, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
order 
and 
artifice, 
is 
something 
essential 
to 
matter, 
produced 
and 
arranged 
by 
sovereign 
wisdom, 
and 
the 
production 
must 
always 
retain 
the 
traces 
of 
its 
author. 
This 
leads 
me 
to 
think 
also 
that 
there 
are 
no 
spirits 
entirely 
separated 
from 
matter 
except 
the 
first 
and 
sovereign 
being, 
and 
that 
the 
genii, 
however 
marvellous 
they 
may 
be, 
are 
always 
accompanied 
by 
bodies 
worthy 
of 
them. 
This 
must 
also 
be 
said 
of 
souls 
which 
nevertheless 
may 
be 
called 
separate 
by 
relation 
to 
this 
gross 
body. 
You 
see 
therefore, 
Madame, 
that 
all 
this 
is 
only 
to 
suppose 
that 
it 
is 
everywhere 
and 
Always 
just 
as 
with 
us 
and 
at 
present 
(the 
supernatural 
excepted), 
except 
degrees 
of 
perfections 
which 
vary; 
and 
I 
leave 
you 
to 
judge 
if 
an 
hypothesis 
atleastsimplerandmoreintelligiblecanbethoughtof. 



This 
very 
maxim, 
not 
to 
suppose 
unnecessarily 
anything 
in 
creatures 
except 
what 
corresponds 
to 
our 
experiences, 
has 
led 
me 
to 
my 
System 
of 
the 
Preestablished 
Harmony. 
For 
we 
experience 
that 
bodies 
act 
among 
themselves 
according 
to 
mechanical 
laws, 
and 
that 
souls 
produce 
in 
themselves 
some 
internal 
actions. 
And 
we 
see 
no 
way 
of 
conceiving 
the 
action 
of 
the 
soul 
upon 
matter, 
or 
of 
matter 
upon 
the 
soul, 
or 
anything 
corresponding 
to 
it; 
it 
not 
being 
explicable 
by 
any 
machine 
whatever 
how 
material 
variations, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
mechanical 
laws, 
cause 
perception 
to 
arise; 
nor 
how 
perception 
can 
produce 
change 
of 
velocity 
or 
of 
direction 
in 
animal 
spirits 
and 
other 
bodies, 
however 
subtile 
or 
gross 
they 
may 
be. 
Thus 
the 
inconceivability 
of 
another 
hypothesis 
as 
much 
as 
the 
good 
order 
of 
nature 
which 
is 
always 
uniform 
(without 
speaking 
here 
of 
other 
considerations), 
have 
made 
me 
believe 
that 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body 
follow 
perfectly 
their 
laws, 
each 
one 
its 
own 
separately, 
without 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
body 
being 
troubled 
by 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
without 
bodies 
finding 
windows 
through 
which 
to 
influence 
souls. 
It 
will 
be 
asked 
then 
whence 
comes 
this 
accord 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body. 
The 
defenders 
of 
occasional 
causes 
teach 
that 
God 
accommodates 
at 
each 
moment 
the 
soul 
to 
the 
body 
and 
the 
body 
to 
the 
soul. 
But 
it 
being 
impossible 
that 
this 
be 
other 
than 
miraculous, 
it 
is 
unsuited 
to 
a 
philosophy 
which 
must 
explain 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
nature, 
for 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
that 
God 
should 
continually 
disturb 
the 
natural 
laws 
of 
bodies. 
This 
is 
why 
I 
believed 
that 
it 
was 
infinitely 
more 
worthy 
of 
the 
economy 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
uniformity 
and 
harmony 
of 
his 
work, 
to 
conclude 
that 
he 
has 
at 
the 
beginning 
created 
souls 
and 
bodies 
such 
that 
each 
following 
its 
own 
laws 
accords 
with 
the 
other. 
It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
this 
is 
possible 
to 
him 
whose 
wisdom 
and 
power 
are 
infinite. 
In 
this 
I 
still 
only 
attribute 
to 
souls 
and 
to 
bodies 
for 
all 
time 
and 
everywhere 
what 
we 
experience 
in 
them 
every 
time 
that 
the 
experience 
is 
distinct, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
mechanical 
laws 
in 
bodies 
and 



internal 
actions 
in 
the 
soul: 
the 
whole 
consisting 
only 
in 
the 
present 
state 
joined 
with 
the 
tendency 
to 
changes, 
which 
take 
place 
in 
the 
body 
according 
to 
the 
moving 
forces 
and 
in 
the 
soul 
according 
to 
the 
perceptions 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 


The 
only 
surprising 
thing 
which 
follows 
from 
this 
is 
that 
the 
works 
of 
God 
are 
infinitely 
more 
beautiful 
and 
more 
harmonious 
than 
had 
been 
believed. 
And 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
subterfuge 
of 
the 
Epicureans 
against 
the 
argument 
drawn 
from 
the 
beauty 
of 
visible 
things 
(when 
they 
say 
that 
among 
numberless 
productions 
of 
chance 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
marvelled 
at 
if 
some 
world 
like 
our 
own 
has 
succeeded 
passably) 
is 
destroyed, 
in 
that 
the 
perpetual 
correspondence 
of 
beings 
which 
have 
no 
influence 
one 
upon 
the 
other 
can 
only 
come 
from 
a 
common 
cause 
of 
this 
harmony. 
M. 
Bayle 
(who 
is 
profound), 
having 
meditated 
on 
the 
consequences 
of 
this 
hypothesis, 
acknowledges 
that 
one 
never 
exalted 
more 
what 
we 
call 
the 
divine 
perfections, 
and 
that 
the 
infinite 
wisdom 
of 
God, 
great 
as 
it 
is, 
is 
not 
too 
great 
to 
produce 
such 
a 
pre-established 
harmony, 
the 
possibility 
of 
which 
he 
seemed 
to 
doubt. 
But 
I 
made 
him 
consider 
that 
even 
men 
produce 
automata 
which 
act 
as 
if 
they 
were 
rational 
and 
that 
God 
(who 
is 
an 
infinitely 
greater 
artist 
or, 
rather, 
with 
whom 
everything 
is 
art 
as 
much 
as 
is 
possible), 
in 
order 
to 
make 
matter 
act 
as 
minds 
require, 
has 
traced 
out 
for 
it 
its 
path. 
So 
that 
after 
this 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
more 
surprised 
at 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
acts 
with 
so 
much 
reason, 
than 
at 
the 
course 
of 
certain 
serpents 
in 
fireworks 
along 
an 
unseen 
cord, 
which 
shows 
that 
it 
is 
a 
man 
who 
manages 
them. 
The 
designs 
of 
God 
can 
only 
he 
grasped 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
perfections 
found 
in 
them, 
and 
bodies 
being 
subjected 
to 
souls 
in 
advance 
in 
order 
to 
be 
accommodated 
to 
their 
voluntary 
actions, 
the 
soul 
in 
its 
turn 
is 
expressive 
of 
bodies 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
primordial 
nature, 
being 
obliged 
to 
represent 
them 
by 
its 
involuntary 
and 



confused 
perceptions. 
Thuseach

CONSIDERATIONS 
ON 
THE 
PRINCIPLES 
OFLIFE, 
AND 
ON 
PLASTIC 
NATURES; 
BY 
THE 
AUTHOR 
OF 
THESYSTEM 
OF 
PREËSTABLISHED 
HARMONY. 
1705. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



AS 
THE 
DISPUTE 
which 
has 
arisen 
on 
plastic 
natures 
and 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
life 
has 
given 
celebrated 
persons 
who 
are 
interested 
in 
it 
occasion 
to 
speak 
of 
my 
system, 
of 
which 
some 
explanation 
seems 
to 
be 
demanded, 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
would 
be 
in 
place 
to 
add 
something 
to 
what 
I 
have 
already 
published 
on 
the 
subject 
in 
various 
passages 
of 
the 
Journals 
quoted 
by 
Bayle 
in 
his 
Dictionary, 
article 
Borarius. 
I 
really 
admit 
principles 
of 
life 
diffused 
throughout 
all 
nature, 
and 
immortal 
since 
they 
are 
indivisible 
substances 
or 
UNITS, 
as 
bodies 
are 
multitudes 
liable 
to 
perish 
by 
dissolution 
of 
their 
parts. 
These 
principles 
of 
life 
or 
these 
souls 
have 
perception 
or 
desire. 
When 
I 
am 
asked 
if 
there 
are 
substantial 
forms, 
I 
reply 
in 
making 
a 
distinction. 
For 
if 
this 
term 
is 
taken 
as 
Descartes 
takes 
it 
when 
he 
maintains 
against 
Regis 
that 
the 
rational 
soul 
is 
the 
substantial 
form 
of 
man, 
I 
will 
answer, 
Yes. 
But 
I 
answer, 
No, 
if 
the 
term 
is 
taken 
as 
those 
take 
it 
who 
imagine 
that 
there 
is 
a 
substantial 
form 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
stone, 
or 
of 
any 
other 
non-organic 
body; 
for 
the 
principles 
of 
life 
belong 
only 
to 
organic 
body. 
It 
is 
true 
(according 
to 
my 
system) 
that 
there 
is 
no 
portion 
of 
matter 
in 
which 
there 
are 
not 
numberless 
organic 
and 
animated 
bodies; 
under 
which 
I 
include 
not 
only 
animals 
and 
plants, 
but 
perhaps 
also 
other 
kinds 
which 
are 
entirely 
unknown 
to 
us. 
But 
for 
all 
this, 
it 
must 
not 
be 
said 
that 
each 
portion 
of 
matter 
is 
animated, 
just 
as 
we 
do 
not 
say 
that 
apond 
fullof 
fishesisananimatedbody, 
althoughafish 
is. 



However, 
my 
opinion 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
life 
is 
in 
certain 
points 
different 
from 
that 
hitherto 
taught. 
One 
of 
these 
points 
is 
that 
all 
have 
believed 
that 
these 
principles 
of 
life 
change 
the 
course 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
bodies, 
or 
at 
least 
give 
occasion 
to 
God 
to 
change 
it, 
whereas, 
according 
to 
my 
system, 
this 
course 
is 
not 
changed 
at 
all 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature, 
God 
having 
pre-established 
it 
as 
it 
ought 
to 
be. 
The 
Peripatetics 
believed 
that 
souls 
had 
an 
influence 
on 
bodies 
and 
that 
according 
to 
their 
will 
or 
desire 
they 
gave 
some 
impression 
to 
bodies. 
And 
the 
celebrated 
authors 
who 
have 
given 
occasion 
for 
the 
present 
dispute, 
by 
their 
principles 
of 
life 
and 
their 
plastic 
natures, 
have 
held 
the 
same 
view, 
although 
they 
are 
not 
Peripatetics. 
We 
cannot 
say 
as 
much 
of 
those 
who 
have 
employed 
αρχαι, 
or 
hylarchic 
principles, 
or 
other 
immaterial 
principles 
under 
different 
names. 
Descartes 
having 
well 
recognized 
that 
there 
is 
a 
law 
of 
nature, 
according 
to 
which 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
force 
is 
preserved 
(although 
he 
was 
deceived 
in 
its 
application 
in 
confounding 
quantity 
of 
force 
with 
quantity 
of 
motion), 
believed 
that 
we 
ought 
not 
to 
ascribe 
to 
the 
soul 
the 
power 
of 
increasing 
or 
diminishing 
the 
force 
of 
bodies, 
but 
simply 
that 
of 
changing 
their 
direction, 
by 
changing 
the 
course 
of 
the 
animal 
spirits. 
And 
those 
Cartesians, 
who 
have 
introduced 
the 
doctrine 
of 
Occasional 
Causes, 
believed 
that 
the 
soul 
not 
being 
able 
to 
exert 
any 
influence 
on 
body, 
it 
was 
necessary 
that 
God 
should 
change 
the 
course 
or 
direction 
of 
the 
animal 
spirits 
according 
to 
the 
volitions 
of 
the 
soul. 
But 
if 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Descartes 
the 
new 
law 
of 
nature, 
which 
I 
have 
demonstrated, 
had 
been 
known, 
which 
affirms 
that 
not 
only 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
total 
force 
of 
bodies 
which 
are 
in 
communication, 
but 
also 
their 
total 
direction, 
is 
preserved, 
he 
would 
probably 
have 
discovered 
my 
system 
of 
Preestablished 
Harmony. 
For 
he 
would 
have 
recognized 
that 
it 
is 
as 
reasonable 
to 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
change 
the 
quantity 
of 
the 
direction 
of 
bodies, 
as 
it 
is 
reasonable 
to 
deny 
to 
the 
soul 
the 
power 
of 
changing 
the 
quantity 
of 
their 
force, 
both 
being 
equally 
contrary 
to 



the 
order 
of 
things 
and 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
nature, 
as 
both 
are 
equally 
inexplicable. 
Thus, 
according 
to 
my 
system, 
souls 
or 
the 
principles 
of 
life 
do 
not 
change 
anything 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
bodies, 
and 
do 
not 
even 
give 
to 
God 
occasion 
to 
do 
so. 
Souls 
follow 
their 
laws 
which 
consist 
in 
a 
certain 
development 
of 
perceptions, 
according 
to 
the 
goods 
and 
the 
evils; 
and 
bodies 
also 
follow 
their 
laws, 
which 
consist 
in 
the 
laws 
of 
motion; 
and 
nevertheless 
these 
two 
beings 
of 
entirely 
different 
kind 
are 
in 
perfect 
accord, 
and 
correspond 
like 
two 
clocks 
perfectly 
regulated 
on 
the 
same 
basis, 
although 
perhaps 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
construction. 
This 
is 
what 
I 
call 
Preestablished 
Harmony, 
which 
removes 
all 
notion 
of 
miracle 
from 
purely 
natural 
actions, 
and 
makes 
things 
run 
their 
course 
regulated 
in 
an 
intelligible 
manner; 
whereas 
the 
common 
system 
has 
recourse 
to 
absolutely 
inexplicable 
influences, 
and 
in 
that 
of 
Occasional 
Causes, 
God, 
by 
a 
sort 
of 
general 
law 
and 
as 
if 
by 
agreement, 
is 
obliged 
to 
change 
at 
each 
moment 
the 
natural 
course 
of 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
soul 
to 
accommodate 
them 
to 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
body, 
and 
to 
disturb 
the 
natural 
course 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
bodies 
according 
to 
the 
volitions 
of 
the 
soul; 
that 
which 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
by 
a 
perpetual 
miracle, 
while 
I 
explain 
it 
quite 
intelligibly 
by 
the 
natures 
which 
God 
has 
establishedinthings. 


My 
system 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
furnishes 
a 
new 
proof, 
hitherto 
unknown, 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God, 
since 
it 
is 
quite 
manifest 
that 
the 
agreement 
of 
so 
many 
substances, 
of 
which 
the 
one 
has 
no 
influence 
upon 
the 
other, 
could 
only 
come 
from 
a 
general 
cause, 
on 
which 
all 
of 
them 
depend, 
and 
that 
this 
must 
have 
infinite 
power 
and 
wisdom 
to 
pre-establish 
all 
these 
harmonies. 
M. 
Bayle 
himself 
has 
thought 
that 
there 
never 
has 
been 
an 
hypothesis 
which 
so 
sets 
in 
relief 
the 
knowledge 
which 
we 
have 
of 
the 
divine 
wisdom. 
The 
system 
has 
moreover 
the 
advantage 
of 
preserving 
in 
all 
its 
rigor 
and 
generality 
the 
great 
principle 
of 
physics 
that 
a 
body 
never 
receives 



change 
in 
its 
motion 
except 
by 
another 
body 
in 
motion 
which 
impels 
it. 
Corpus 
non 
moveri 
nisi 
impulsum 
a 
corpore 
contiguo 
et 
moto. 
This 
law 
has 
been 
violated 
hitherto 
by 
all 
those 
who 
have 
admitted 
souls 
or 
other 
immaterial 
principles, 
all 
Cartesians 
included. 
The 
followers 
of 
Democritus, 
Hobbes, 
and 
some 
other 
thorough-going 
materialists, 
who 
have 
rejected 
all 
immaterial 
substance, 
having 
alone 
up 
to 
this 
time 
preserved 
this 
law 
have 
believed 
that 
they 
found 
therein 
ground 
for 
insulting 
other 
philosophers, 
as 
if 
they 
thus 
maintained 
a 
very 
irrational 
opinion. 
But 
the 
ground 
of 
their 
triumph 
has 
been 
but 
apparent 
and 
ad 
homimem; 
and 
far 
from 
serving 
them, 
it 
serves 
to 
confound 
them, 
and 
now, 
their 
illusion 
being 
discovered 
and 
their 
advantage 
turned 
against 
them, 
it 
seems 
that 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
the 
first 
time 
that 
the 
best 
philosophy 
shows 
itself 
also 
the 
most 
conformed 
in 
all 
respects 
to 
reason, 
nothing 
remaining 
which 
can 
be 
opposed 
to 
it. 
This 
general 
principle, 
although 
it 
excludes 
particular 
first 
movers, 
by 
making 
us 
deny 
this 
quality 
to 
soul 
or 
to 
immaterial 
created 
principles, 
leads 
us 
so 
much 
the 
more 
surely 
and 
clearly 
to 
the 
universal 
first 
mover, 
from 
whom 
comes 
equally 
the 
succession 
and 
harmony 
of 
perceptions. 
They 
are 
like 
two 
kingdoms, 
the 
one 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
the 
other 
of 
final; 
each 
of 
which 
separately 
suffices 
in 
detail 
for 
explaining 
all 
as 
if 
the 
other 
did 
not 
exist. 
But 
the 
one 
does 
not 
suffice 
without 
the 
other 
in 
what 
is 
general 
of 
their 
origin, 
fortheyemanatefroma 
sourceinwhichthepower 
whichconstitutesefficient 
causes 
and 
the 
wisdom 
which 
regulates 
final 
causes 
are 
found 
united. 
This 
maxim 
also, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
motion 
which 
has 
not 
its 
origin 
in 
another 
motion, 
according 
to 
laws 
of 
mechanics, 
leads 
us 
again 
to 
the 
first 
mover, 
because 
matter 
being 
indifferent 
in 
itself 
to 
all 
motion 
or 
rest, 
and 
nevertheless 
always 
possessing 
motion 
with 
all 
its 
force 
and 
direction, 
it 
couldnothavebeenputin

There 
is 
still 
another 
difference 
between 
the 
opinions 
of 
other 
authors 
who 
favor 
the 
principles 
of 
life, 
and 
mine. 
It 
is 
that 
I 
believe 
at 
the 
same 
time 
both 
that 
these 
principles 
of 
life 
are 
immortal 
and 
that 
they 
are 
everywhere; 
whereas 
according 
to 
the 
common 
opinion 
the 
souls 
of 
brutes 
perish, 
and 
according 
to 
the 
Cartesians, 
man 
only 
has 
really 
a 
soul 
and 
even 
perception 
and 
desire; 
an 
opinion 
which 
will 
never 
be 
approved, 
and 
which 
has 
only 
been 
embraced 
because 
it 
was 
seen 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
either 
to 
accord 
to 
brutes 
immortal 
souls 
or 
to 
avow 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
might 
be 
mortal. 
But 
it 
oughtrathertohavebeensaidthateverysimplesubstance 
beingimperishable 
and 
every 
soul 
being 
consequently 
immortal, 
that 
which 
could 
not 
be 
reasonably 
refused, 
to 
brutes, 
cannot 
fail 
also 
to 
subsist 
always, 
although 
in 
a 
way 
very 
different 
from 
our 
own, 
since 
brutes, 
as 
far 
as 
can 
be 
judged, 
are 
lacking 
in 
that 
reflection 
which 
makes 
us 
think 
of 
ourselves. 
And 
we 
do 
not 
see 
why 
men 
have 
been 
so 
loath 
to 
accord 
to 
the 
bodies 
of 
other 
organic 
creatures 
immaterial, 
imperishable 
substances, 
since 
the 
defenders 
of 
atoms 
have 
introduced 
material 
substances 
which 
do 
not 
perish, 
and 
since 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
brute 
has 
no 
more 
reflection 
than 
an 
atom. 
For 
there 
is 
a 
broad 
difference 
between 
feeling 
which 
is 
common 
to 
these 
souls 
and 
the 
reflection 
which 
accompanies 
reason, 
since 
we 
have 
a 
thousand 
feelings 
without 
reflecting 
upon 
them; 
and 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
ever 
proved 
or 
can 
prove 
that 
every 
perception 
is 
accompanied 
by 
consciousness. 
It 
is 
reasonable 
also 
that 
there 
may 
be 
substances 
capable 
of 
perception 
below 
us 
as 
there 
are 
above; 
and 
that 
our 
soul 
far 
from 
being 
the 
last 
of 
all 
is 
in 
a 
middle 
position 
from 
which 
one 
may 
descend 
and 
ascend, 
otherwise 
there 
would 
be 
adefectoforder 
which 
certain 
philosopherscall 
vacuum 
formarum. 
Thus 
reason 
and 
nature 
lead 
men 
to 
the 
opinion 
I 
have 
just 
propounded; 
but 
prejudices 
haveturnedthemasidefrom 
it. 



This 
view 
leads 
us 
to 
another 
where 
I 
am 
again 
obliged 
to 
diverge 
from 
the 
received 
opinion. 
It 
will 
be 
asked 
of 
those 
who 
are 
of 
my 
opinion 
what 
the 
souls 
of 
brutes 
will 
do 
after 
the 
death 
of 
the 
animal, 
and 
they 
will 
impute 
to 
us 
the 
dogma 
of 
Pythagoras 
who 
believed 
in 
the 
transmigration 
of 
souls, 
which 
not 
only 
the 
late 
M. 
Van 
Helmont, 
the 
younger, 
but 
also 
an 
ingenious 
author 
of 
certain 
Metaphysical 
Meditations, 
published 
at 
Paris, 
have 
wished 
to 
revive. 
But 
it 
must 
be 
known 
that 
I 
am 
far 
from 
this 
opinion, 
because 
I 
believe 
that 
not 
only 
the 
soul 
but 
also 
the 
same 
animal 
subsists. 
Persons 
very 
accurate 
in 
experiments 
have 
already 
in 
our 
day 
perceived 
that 
it 
may 
be 
doubted 
whether 
an 
altogether 
new 
animal 
is 
ever 
produced, 
and 
whether 
animals 
wholly 
alive 
as 
well 
as 
plants 
are 
not 
already 
in 
miniature 
in 
germs 
before 
conception. 
This 
doctrine 
being 
granted, 
it 
will 
be 
reasonable 
to 
think 
that 
what 
does 
not 
begin 
to 
live 
also 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
live, 
and 
that 
death 
like 
generation 
is 
only 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
same 
animal 
which 
is 
sometimes 
augmented 
and 
sometimes 
diminished. 
This 
again 
reveals 
to 
us 
hitherto 
unthought-of 
marvels 
of 
divine 
contrivance. 
This 
is, 
that 
the 
machines 
of 
nature 
being 
machines 
even 
to 
their 
smallest 
parts 
are 
indestructible, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
envelopment 
of 
one 
little 
machine 
in 
a 
greater 
ad 
infinitum. 
Thus 
one 
finds 
one’s 
self 
obliged 
at 
the 
same 
time 
to 
maintain 
the 
preexistence 
of 
the 
soul 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
animal, 
and 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
animal 
aswell 
asofthesoul. 


I 
have 
gradually 
been 
led 
to 
explain 
my 
view 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
plants 
and 
animals, 
since 
it 
appears 
from 
what 
I 
have 
just 
said 
that 
they 
are 
never 
formed 
altogether 
anew. 
I 
am 
therefore 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
Cudworth 
(the 
greater 
part 
of 
whose 
excellent 
work 
pleases 
me 
extremely) 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
mechanics 
alone 
could 
not 
form 
an 
animal 
where 
there 
is 
nothing 
yet 
organized; 
and 
I 
find 
that 
with 
reason 
he 
is 
opposed 
to 
what 
some 
of 
the 
ancients 
have 
imagined 
on 
this 
subject 
and 
even 
Descartes 
in 
his 
L’Homme, 



the 
formation 
of 
which 
costs 
him 
so 
little, 
but 
which 
is 
also 
very 
far 
from 
being 
a 
real 
man. 
And 
I 
reinforce 
this 
opinion 
of 
Cudworth 
by 
presenting 
for 
consideration 
the 
fact 
that 
matter 
arranged 
by 
divine 
wisdom 
must 
be 
essentially 
organized 
throughout, 
and 
that 
thus 
there 
is 
a 
machine 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
natural 
machine 
ad 
infinitum, 
and 
so 
many 
envelopes 
and 
organic 
bodies 
enfolded 
one 
within 
another 
that 
an 
organic 
body 
never 
could 
be 
produced 
altogether 
new 
and 
without 
any 
preformation; 
nor 
could 
an 
animal 
already 
existing 
be 
entirely 
destroyed. 
Thus 
I 
have 
no 
need 
to 
resort 
with 
Cudworth 
to 
certain 
immaterial 
plastic 
natures, 
although 
I 
remember 
that 
Julius 
Scaliger 
and 
other 
Peripatetics 
and 
also 
certain 
partisans 
of 
the 
Helmontian 
doctrine 
of 
Archæi 
have 
believed 
that 
the 
soul 
manufactures 
its 
own 
body. 
I 
may 
say 
of 
it 
non 
mi 
bisogna, 
e 
non 
mi 
basta, 
for 
the 
very 
reason 
of 
the 
preformation 
and 
organism 
ad 
infinitum 
which 
furnishes 
me 
the 
material 
plastic 
natures 
suited 
to 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
case; 
whereas 
the 
immaterial 
plastic 
principles 
areas 
little 
necessaryas 
they 
arelittle 
capableof 
satisfying 
the 
ease. 
For 
since 
the 
animals 
are 
never 
formed 
naturally 
of 
a 
non-
organic 
mass, 
the 
mechanism 
incapable 
of 
producing 
de 
novo 
these 
infinitely 
varied 
organs 
can 
very 
well 
derive 
them 
through 
the 
development 
and 
through 
the 
transformation 
of 
a 
pre-existing 
organic 
body. 
Meanwhile 
those 
who 
employ 
plastic 
natures 
whether 
material 
or 
immaterial 
in 
no 
wise 
weaken 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
drawn 
from 
the 
marvels 
of 
nature, 
which 
appear 
particularly 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
animals, 
provided 
that 
these 
defenders 
of 
immaterial 
plastic 
natures, 
add 
a 
particular 
direction 
from 
God, 
and 
provided 
that 
those 
who 
with 
me 
make 
use 
of 
a 
material 
cause 
in 
assenting 
to 
plastic 
mechanism, 
maintain 
not 
only 
a 
continual 
preformation, 
but 
also 
an 
original 
divine 
pre-establishment. 
Thus 
whatever 
way 
we 
take 
we 
cannot 
overlook 
the 
divine 
existence 
in 
wishing 
to 
explain 
these 
marvels, 



which 
have 
always 
been 
admired 
but 
which 
have 
never 
been 
more 
apparent 
thaninmy 
system. 


We 
see 
by 
this 
that 
not 
only 
the 
soul 
but 
also 
the 
annual 
must 
subsist 
always 
in 
the 
ordinary 
course 
of 
things. 
But 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
are 
made 
and 
applied 
with 
so 
much 
order 
and 
so 
much 
wisdom 
that 
they 
serve 
more 
than 
one 
end, 
and 
God, 
who 
occupies 
the 
position 
of 
inventor 
and 
architect 
as 
regards 
the 
mechanism 
of 
nature, 
occupies 
the 
position 
of 
king 
and 
father 
to 
substances 
possessing 
intelligence, 
and 
of 
these 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
spirit 
formed 
after 
his 
image. 
And 
as 
regards 
spirits, 
his 
kingdom, 
of 
which 
they 
are 
the 
citizens, 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
monarchy 
which 
can 
be 
invented; 
in 
which 
there 
is 
no 
sin 
which 
does 
not 
bring 
upon 
itself 
some 
punishment, 
and 
no 
good 
action 
without 
some 
recompense; 
in 
which 
everything 
tends 
finally 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
monarch 
and 
the 
happiness 
of 
the 
subjects, 
by 
the 
most 
beautiful 
combination 
of 
justice 
and 
goodness 
which 
can 
be 
desired. 
Nevertheless 
I 
dare 
not 
assert 
anything 
positively 
either 
as 
regards 
pre-existence 
or 
as 
regards 
the 
details 
of 
the 
future 
condition 
of 
human 
souls, 
since 
God 
might 
make 
use 
of 
extraordinary 
ways 
in 
the 
kingdom 
of 
grace; 
nevertheless 
that 
which 
natural 
reason 
favors 
ought 
to 
be 
preferred, 
at 
least 
if 
Revelation 
does 
notteach 
usthecontrary,a 
point 
whichIdonothere 
undertaketodecide. 


Before 
ending, 
it 
will 
perhaps 
be 
well 
to 
note, 
among 
the 
other 
advantages 
of 
my 
system, 
that 
of 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
laws 
which 
I 
employ, 
which 
are 
always 
withoutexception 
in 
my 
general 
philosophy:and 
it 
is 
just 
the 
opposite 
in 
other 
systems. 
For 
example, 
I 
have 
already 
said 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
mechanics 
are 
never 
violated 
in 
natural 
motions, 
that 
the 
same 
force 
is 
always 
preserved, 
as 
also 
the 
same 
direction, 
and 
that 
everything 
takes 
place 
in 
souls 
as 
if 
there 
were 
no 
body, 
and 
that 
everything 
takes 
place 
in 
bodies 
as 
if 
there 
were 
no 
souls; 
that 
there 
is 
no 
part 
of 
space 
which 
is 
not 
full; 
that 
there 
is 
no 
particle 
of 
matter 
which 
is 
not 
actually 
divided, 
and 
which 
does 
not 
contain 
organic 



bodies; 
that 
there 
are 
also 
souls 
everywhere, 
as 
there 
are 
bodies 
everywhere; 
that 
souls 
and 
the 
same 
animals 
always 
subsist; 
that 
organic 
bodies 
are 
never 
without 
souls, 
and 
that 
souls 
are 
never 
separated 
from 
all 
organic 
body; 
although 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
true 
that 
there 
is 
no 
portion 
of 
matter 
of 
which 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
always 
affected 
by 
the 
same 
soul. 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
then 
that 
there 
are 
naturally 
souls 
entirely 
separated, 
nor 
that 
there 
are 
created 
spirits 
entirely 
detached, 
from 
all 
body, 
in 
which 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
several 
ancient 
Church 
Fathers. 
God 
only 
is 
above 
all 
matter, 
since 
he 
is 
its 
author; 
but 
creatures, 
free 
or 
freed 
from 
matter, 
would 
be 
at 
the 
same 
time 
detached 
from 
the 
universal 
concatenation, 
and 
like 
deserters 
from 
the 
general 
order. 
This 
universality 
of 
laws 
is 
confirmed 
by 
its 
great 
facility 
of 
explanation, 
since 
the 
uniformity, 
which 
I 
think 
is 
observed 
in 
all 
nature, 
brings 
about 
that 
everywhere 
else, 
in 
all 
time 
and 
in 
every 
place, 
it 
can 
be 
said 
that 
all 
is 
as 
it 
is 
here, 
to 
the 
degrees 
of 
greatness 
and 
of 
near 
perfection; 
and 
that 
thus 
those 
things 
which 
are 
farthest

and 
most 
concealed 
are

LETTER 
TO 
M. 
COSTE 
ON 
NECESSITY 
AND 
CONTINGENCY. 
1707. 


[FromtheFrench], 



HANOVER, 
DEC. 
19, 
1707. 


ToM. 
COSTE, 
London: 


I 
thank 
you 
very 
much 
for 
communicating 
to 
me 
the 
last 
additions 
and 
corrections 
of 
Locke, 
and 
I 
am 
pleased 
also 
to 
learn 
what 
you 
tell 
me 
of 
his 
last 
dispute 
with 
Limborch. 
The 
liberty 
of 
indifference, 
about 
which 
the 
dispute 
turns 
and 
my 
opinion 
of 
which 
you, 
sir, 
ask, 
consists 
in 
a 
certain 
subtilty 
which 
few 
people 
trouble 
themselves 
to 
understand 
and 
of 
which 
many 
people 
nevertheless 
reason. 
This 
carries 
us 
back 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
necessityandofcontingency. 


Atruth 
is 
necessary 
when 
the 
opposite 
involves 
contradiction, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
it 
is 
called 
contingent. 
It 
is 
a 
necessary 
truth 
that 
God 
exists, 
that 
all 
right 
angles 
are 
equal, 
etc. 
but 
that 
I 
myself 
exist, 
and 
that 
there 
are 
bodies 
in 
nature 
which 
show 
an 
angle 
actually 
right, 
are 
contingent 
truths. 
For 
the 
whole 
universe 
might 
be 
otherwise; 
time, 
space, 
and 
matter 
being 
absolutely 
indifferent 
to 
motions 
and 
forms. 
And 
God 
has 
chosen 
among 
an 
infinitenumberofpossibleswhathejudged 
mostfit. 
Butsincehehaschosen, 
it 
must 
be 
affirmed 
that 
everything 
is 
comprised 
in 
his 
choice 
and 
that 
nothing 
could 
he 
changed, 
since 
he 
has 
once 
for 
all 
foreseen 
and 
regulated 
all; 
he 
who 
could 
not 
regulate 
things 
piecemeal 
and 
by 
fits 
and 
starts. 
Therefore 
the 
sins 
and 
evils 
which 
he 
has 
judged 
proper 
to 
permit 
for 
greater 
goods 
are 
comprised 
in 
his 
choice. 
This 
is 
the 
necessity, 
which 
can 
now 
be 



ascribed 
to 
things 
in 
the 
future, 
which 
is 
called 
hypothetical 
or 
consequent 
necessity 
(that 
is 
to 
say, 
founded 
upon 
the 
consequence 
of 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
choice 
made), 
which 
does 
not 
destroy 
the 
contingency 
of 
things, 
and 
does 
not 
produce 
that 
absolute 
necessity 
which 
contingency 
does 
not 
allow. 
And 
nearly 
all 
theologians 
and 
philosophers 
(for 
we 
must 
except 
the 
Socinians) 
acknowledge 
the 
hypothetical 
necessity 
which 
I 
have 
just 
explained, 
and 
which 
cannot 
he 
combated 
without 
overthrowing 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
and 
eventhenature 
ofthings. 


Nevertheless, 
although 
all 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
universe 
are 
now 
certain 
in 
relation 
to 
God, 
or 
(what 
amounts 
to 
the 
same 
thing) 
are 
determined 
in 
themselves 
and 
even 
linked 
among 
themselves, 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
their 
connection 
is 
always 
truly 
necessary; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
truth, 
which 
pronounces 
that 
one 
fact 
follows 
another, 
is 
necessary. 
And 
this 
must 
be 
applied 
particularly 
to 
voluntary 
actions. 
When 
a 
choice 
is 
proposed, 
for 
example 
to 
go 
out 
or 
not 
to 
go 
out, 
it 
is 
a 
question 
whether, 
with 
all 
the 
circumstances, 
internal 
and 
external, 
motives, 
perceptions, 
dispositions, 
impressions, 
passions, 
inclinations 
taken 
together, 
I 
am 
still 
in 
a 
contingent 
state, 
or 
whether 
I 
am 
necessitated 
to 
make 
choice, 
for 
example, 
to 
go 
out; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
whether 
this 
proposition 
true 
and 
determined 
in 
fact, 
In 
all 
these 
circumstances 
taken 
together 
I 
shall 
choose 
to 
go 
out, 
is 
contingent 
or 
necessary. 
To 
this 
I 
reply 
that 
it 
is 
contingent, 
because 
neither 
I 
nor 
any 
other 
mind 
more 
enlightened 
than 
I, 
could 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
opposite 
of 
this 
truth 
implies 
contradiction. 
And 
supposing 
that 
by 
liberty 
of 
indifference 
is 
understood 
a 
liberty 
opposed, 
to 
necessity 
(as 
I 
have 
just 
explained 
it), 
I 
acknowledge 
this 
liberty 
for 
I 
am 
really 
of 
opinion 
that 
our 
liberty, 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
God 
and 
of 
the 
blessed 
spirits, 
is 
exempt 
not 
only 
from 
co-action 
but 
furthermore 
from 
absolute 
necessity, 
although 
it 
can 
not 
be 
exempt 
from 
determinationandfromcertainty. 



But 
I 
find 
that 
there 
is 
need 
of 
great 
precaution 
here 
in 
order 
not 
to 
fall 
into 
a 
chimera 
which 
shocks 
the 
principles 
of 
good 
sense, 
and 
which 
would 
be 
what 
I 
call 
an 
absolute 
indifference 
or 
an 
indifference 
of 
equilibrium, 
which 
some 
conceive 
in 
liberty, 
and 
which 
I 
believe 
chimerical. 
It 
must 
be 
observed 
then 
that 
that 
connection 
of 
which 
I 
just 
spoke 
is 
not 
necessary, 
speaking 
absolutely, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
none 
the 
less 
certainly 
true, 
and 
that 
in 
general 
every 
time 
that 
in 
all 
the 
circumstances 
taken 
together 
the 
balance 
of 
deliberation 
is 
heavier 
on 
the 
one 
side 
than 
on 
the 
other, 
it 
is 
certain 
and 
infallible 
that 
that 
side 
will 
carry 
the 
day. 
God 
or 
the 
perfect 
sage 
would 
always 
choose, 
the 
best 
that 
is 
known, 
and 
if 
one 
thing 
was 
no 
better 
than 
another, 
they 
would 
choose 
neither. 
In 
other 
intelligent 
substances 
passions 
often 
take 
the 
place 
of 
reason, 
and 
it 
can 
always 
be 
said 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
will 
in 
general 
that 
the 
choice 
follows 
the 
greatest 
inclination, 
under 
which 
I 
understand 
passionsas 
wellasreasons, 
trueor 
apparent. 


Nevertheless 
I 
see 
that 
there 
are 
people 
who 
imagine 
that 
we 
are 
determined 
sometimes 
for 
the 
side 
which 
is 
the 
less 
weighted, 
that 
God 
chooses 
sometimes 
the 
least 
good 
everything 
considered, 
and 
that 
man 
chooses 
sometimes 
without 
object 
and 
against 
all 
his 
reasons, 
dispositions, 
and 
passions, 
finally 
that 
one 
chooses 
sometimes 
without 
any 
reason 
which 
determines 
the 
choice. 
But 
this 
I 
hold 
to 
be 
false 
and 
absurd, 
since 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
principles 
of 
good 
sense 
that 
nothing 
ever 
occurs 
without 
cause 
or 
determining 
reason. 
Thus 
when 
God 
chooses 
it 
is 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
Best, 
when 
man 
chooses 
it 
will 
be 
the 
side 
which 
shall 
have 
struck 
him 
most. 
If 
moreover 
he 
chooses 
that 
which 
he 
sees 
to 
be 
less 
useful 
and 
less 
agreeable, 
it 
will 
have 
become 
perhaps 
to 
him 
the 
most 
agreeable 
through 
caprice, 
through 
a 
spirit 
of 
contradiction, 
and 
through 
similar 
reasons 
of 
a 
depraved 
taste, 
which 
would 
none 
the 
less 
be 
determining 
reasons, 
even 
if 
they 
should 



not 
be 
conclusive 
reasons. 
And 
never 
can 
any 
example 
to 
the 
contrary 
be 
found. 


Thus 
although 
we 
have 
a 
liberty 
of 
indifference 
which 
saves 
us 
from 
necessity, 
we 
never 
have 
an 
indifference 
of 
equilibrium 
which 
exempts 
us 
from 
determining 
reasons; 
there 
is 
always 
something 
which 
inclines 
us 
and 
makes 
us 
choose, 
but 
without 
being 
able 
to 
necessitate 
us. 
And 
just 
as 
God 
is 
always 
infallibly 
led 
to 
the 
best 
although 
he 
is 
not 
led 
necessarily 
(other 
than 
by 
a 
moral 
necessity), 
so 
we 
are 
always 
infallibly 
led 
to 
that 
which 
strikes 
us 
most, 
but 
not 
necessarily. 
The 
contrary 
not 
implying 
any 
contradiction, 
it 
was 
not 
necessary 
or 
essential 
that 
God 
should 
create 
nor 
that 
he 
should 
create 
this 
worldinparticular,although 
his 
wisdom 
andgoodnesshas 
led 
himto 
it. 


It 
is 
this 
that 
M. 
Bayle, 
very 
subtle 
as 
he 
has 
been, 
has 
not 
sufficiently 
considered 
when 
he 
thought 
that 
a 
case 
similar 
to 
the 
ass 
of 
Buridan 
was 
possible, 
and 
that 
a 
man 
placed 
in 
circumstances 
of 
perfect 
equilibrium 
could 
none 
the 
less 
choose. 
For 
it 
must 
be 
said 
that 
the 
case 
of 
a 
perfect 
equilibrium 
is 
chimerical 
and 
never 
occurs, 
the 
universe 
not 
being 
able 
to 
be 
parted 
or 
cut 
into 
parts 
equal 
and 
alike. 
The 
universe 
is 
not 
like 
an 
ellipse 
or 
other 
such 
oval 
which 
the 
straight 
line 
drawn 
through 
its 
centre 
can 
cut 
in 
two 
congruent 
parts. 
The 
universe 
has 
no 
centre 
and 
its 
parts 
are 
infinitely 
varied, 
thus 
the 
case 
will 
never 
occur 
where 
all 
will 
be 
perfectly 
equal 
and 
will 
strike 
equally 
from 
one 
side 
and 
from 
the 
other, 
and 
although 
we 
are 
not 
always 
capable 
of 
perceiving 
all 
the 
little 
impressions 
which 
contribute 
to 
determine 
us, 
there 
is 
always 
something 
which 
determines 
us 
between 
two 
contradictories, 
without 
theeaseeverbeingperfectly 
equalon 
the 
onesideandon 
the 
other. 


Nevertheless, 
although 
our 
choice 
ex 
datis 
on 
all 
the 
internal 
and 
external 
circumstances 
taken 
together 
is 
always 
determined, 
and 
although 
for 
the 
present 
it 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
us 
to 
change 
the 
will, 
it 
is 
none 
the 
less 
true 
that 
we 
have 
great 
power 
over 
our 
future 
wills 
by 
choosing 
certain 
objects 
of 



our 
attention 
and 
by 
accustoming 
ourselves 
to 
certain 
ways 
of 
thinking, 
and 
by 
this 
means 
we 
can 
accustom 
ourselves 
the 
better 
to 
resist 
impressions 
and 
the 
better 
make 
the 
reason 
act, 
to 
the 
end 
that 
we 
can 
contribute 
toward 
makingourselveswillwhatweoughtto. 


For 
the 
rest 
I 
have 
elsewhere 
shown, 
that, 
regarding 
matters 
in 
a 
certain 
metaphysical 
sense, 
we 
are 
always 
in 
a 
state 
of 
perfect 
spontaneity, 
and 
that 
what 
is 
attributed 
to 
the 
impressions 
of 
external 
things 
comes 
only 
from 
confused 
perceptions 
in 
us 
which 
correspond 
to 
them, 
and 
which 
cannot 
but 
be 
given 
us 
at 
the 
start 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
pre-established 
harmony 
which 
establishes 
theconnectionofeachsubstance 
withallothers. 


If 
it 
were 
true, 
sir, 
that 
your 
Sevennese 
were 
prophets, 
that 
event 
would 
not 
be 
contrary 
to 
my 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
and 
would 
even 
be 
in 
thorough 
agreement 
with 
it. 
I 
have 
always 
said 
that 
the 
present 
is 
big 
with 
the 
future 
and 
that 
there 
is 
a 
perfect 
connection 
between 
things 
however 
distant 
they 
may 
be 
one 
from 
another, 
so 
that 
one 
of 
sufficient 
penetrationmightreadtheoneintheother. 
Ishouldnotevenopposeonewho 
should 
maintain 
that 
there 
are 
globes 
in 
the 
universe 
where 
prophecies 
are 
more 
common 
than 
on 
our 
own, 
as 
there 
will 
perhaps 
be 
a 
world 
in 
which 
dogs 
will 
have 
sufficiently 
good 
noses 
to 
scent 
their 
game 
at 
a 
thousand 
leagues, 
perhaps 
also 
there 
are 
globes 
in 
which 
genii 
have 
more 
freedom 
than 
here 
below 
to 
mix 
in 
the 
actions 
of 
rational 
animals. 
But 
when 
the 
question 
is 
to 
reason 
on 
what 
is 
actually 
practised 
here, 
our 
presumptive 
judgment 
must 
be 
founded 
on 
the 
custom 
of 
our 
globe, 
where 
prophetic 
views 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
very 
rare. 
We 
cannot 
swear 
that 
there 
are 
none, 
but 
we 
could 
wager 
that 
these 
in 
question 
are 
not 
such. 
One 
of 
the 
reasons 
which 
would 
most 
lead 
me 
to 
judge 
favorably 
of 
them 
would 
be 
the 
judgment 
of 
M. 
Fatio 
but 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
know 
his 
opinion 
without 
taking 
it 
from 
the 
newspaper. 
If 
you 
had 
with 
all 
due 
attention 
associated 
yourself 
with 
a 
gentleman 
with 
an 



income 
of 
£2000 
sterling 
who 
prophesies 
in 
Greek, 
in 
Latin, 
and 
in 
French, 
although 
he 
only 
knows 
English 
well, 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
to 
be 
said. 
So 
I 
beg 
you, 
sir, 
to 
enlighten 
me 
more 
on 
a 
matter 
so 
interesting 
and 
important.

REFUTATION 
OF 
SPINOZA, 
C. 
1708. 


[From 
the 
Latin.] 



TH 
E 
AUTHOR 
[WACHTER] 
passes 
on 
(ch. 
4) 
to 
Spinoza, 
whom 
he 
compares 
with 
the 
cabalists. 
Spinoza 
(Eth. 
pt. 
2, 
prop. 
10, 
schol.) 
says: 
“Every 
one 
must 
admit 
that 
nothing 
is 
or 
can 
he 
conceived 
without 
God. 
For 
it 
is 
acknowledged 
by 
everyone 
that 
God 
is 
the 
sole 
cause 
of 
all 
things, 
of 
their 
essence 
as 
well 
as 
of 
their 
existence; 
that 
is, 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
things, 
not 
only 
in 
respect 
to 
their 
being 
made 
(secundum, 
fieri), 
but 
also 
in 
respect 
to 
their 
being 
(secundum 
esse).” 
This, 
from 
Spinoza, 
the 
author 
[Wachter] 
appears 
to 
approve. 
And 
it 
is 
true 
that 
we 
must 
speak 
of 
created 
things 
only 
as 
permitted 
by 
the 
nature 
of 
God. 
But 
I 
do 
not 
think 
that 
Spinoza 
has 
succeeded 
in 
this. 
Essences 
can 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
be 
conceived 
of 
without 
God, 
but 
existences 
involve 
God. 
And 
the 
very 
reality 
of 
essences 
by 
which 
they 
exert 
an 
influence 
upon 
existences 
is 
from 
God. 
The 
essences 
of 
things 
are 
co-eternal 
with 
God. 
And 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
God 
embraces 
all 
other 
essences 
to 
such 
a 
degree 
that 
God 
cannot 
be 
perfectly 
conceived 
without 
them. 
But 
existence 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
of 
without 
God, 
who 
is 
the 
final 
reasonofthings. 


This 
axiom, 
“To 
the 
essence 
of 
a 
thing 
belongs 
that 
without 
which 
it 
can 
neither 
be 
nor 
be 
conceived,” 
is 
to 
be 
applied 
in 
necessary 
things 
or 
in 
species, 
but 
not 
in 
individuals 
or 
contingent 
things. 
For 
individuals 
cannot 
be 
distinctly 
conceived. 
Hence 
they 
have 
no 
necessary 
connection 
with 
God, 
but 
are 
produced 
freely. 
God 
has 
been 
inclined 
toward 
these 
by 
a 
determining 
reason, 
but 
hehas 
not 
beennecessitated. 



Spinoza 
(de 
Emend. 
Intel. 
p. 
374) 
places 
among 
fictions 
the 
dictum, 
“Something 
can 
be 
produced 
from 
nothing.” 
But, 
in 
truth, 
modes 
which 
are 
produced, 
are 
produced 
from 
nothing. 
Since 
there 
is 
no 
matter 
of 
modes, 
assuredly 
neither 
the 
mode, 
nor 
a 
part 
of 
it, 
has 
preëxisted, 
but 
only 
another 
modewhich 
hasdisappearedandto 
whichthispresentone 
has 
succeeded. 


The 
cabalists 
seem 
to 
say 
that 
matter, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
vileness 
of 
its 
essence, 
can 
neither 
be 
created 
nor 
can 
it 
exist; 
hence, 
that 
there 
is 
absolutely 
no 
matter, 
or 
that 
spirit 
and 
matter, 
as 
Henry 
More 
maintains 
in 
his 
cabalistic 
theses, 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing. 
Spinoza, 
likewise, 
denies 
that 
God 
could 
have 
created 
any 
corporeal 
and 
material 
mass 
to 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
this 
world, 
“because,” 
he 
says, 
“those 
who 
differ 
do 
not 
know 
by 
what 
divine 
power 
it 
could 
have 
been 
created.” 
There 
is 
some 
truth 
in 
these 
words, 
but 
I 
think 
it 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
understood. 
Matter 
does, 
in 
reality, 
exist, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
a 
substance, 
since 
itisan 
aggregateorresultantof 
substances: 
Ispeak 
ofmatter 
as 
far 
as 
it 
is 
secondary 
or 
of 
extended 
mass, 
which 
is 
not 
at 
all 
a 
homogeneous 
body. 
But 
that 
which 
we 
conceive 
of 
as 
homogeneous 
and 
call 
primary 
matter 
is 
something 
incomplete, 
since 
it 
is 
merely 
potential. 
Substance,onthecontrary,is 
somethingfullandactive. 


Spinoza 
believed 
that 
matter, 
as 
commonly 
understood, 
did 
not 
exist. 
Hence 
he 
often 
warns 
us 
that 
matter 
is 
badly 
defined 
by 
Descartes 
as 
extension 
(Ep. 
73), 
and 
extension 
is 
poorly 
explained 
as 
a 
very 
vile 
thing 
which 
must 
be 
divisible 
in 
place, 
“since 
(de 
Emend. 
Intel. 
p. 
385) 
matter 
ought 
to 
be 
explained 
as 
an 
attribute 
expressing 
an 
eternal 
and 
infinite 
essence.” 
I 
reply 
that 
extension, 
or 
if 
you 
prefer, 
primary 
matter, 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
certain 
indefinite 
repetition 
of 
things 
as 
far 
as 
they 
are 
similar 
to 
each 
other 
or 
indiscernible. 
But 
just 
as 
number 
supposes 
numbered 
things, 
so 
extension 
supposes 
things 
which 
are 
repeated, 
and 
which 
have, 
in 
addition 
to 
common 
characteristics, 
others 
peculiar 
to 
themselves. 
These 
accidents, 



peculiar 
to 
each 
one, 
render 
the 
limits 
of 
size 
and 
shape, 
before 
only 
possible, 
actual. 
Merely 
passive 
matter 
is 
something 
very 
vile, 
that 
is, 
wanting 
in 
all 
virtue,butsuchathingconsistsonlyinthe

Spinoza 
(Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 
13, 
corol. 
and 
prop. 
15, 
schol.) 
says: 
“No 
substance, 
not 
even 
corporeal 
substance, 
is 
divisible.” 
This 
statement 
is 
not 
surprising 
according 
to 
his 
system, 
since 
he 
admits 
but 
one 
substance; 
but 
it 
is 
equally 
true 
in 
mine, 
although 
I 
admit 
innumerable 
substances, 
for, 
in 
my 
system, 
all 
areindivisibleor 
monads. 


He 
says 
(Eth. 
pt. 
3, 
prop. 
2, 
schol.) 
that 
“the 
mind 
and 
the 
body 
are 
the 
same 
thing, 
only 
expressed 
in 
two 
ways,” 
and 
(Eth. 
pt. 
2, 
prop. 
7, 
schol.) 
that 
“thinking 
substance 
and 
extended 
substance 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same, 
known 
now 
under 
the 
attribute 
of 
thought, 
now 
under 
that 
of 
extension.” 
He 
says 
in 
the 
same 
scholitun, 
“This, 
certain 
Hebrews 
seem 
to 
have 
seen 
as 
through 
a 
cloud, 
who 
indeed 
maintain 
that 
God, 
the 
intellect 
of 
God, 
and 
the 
things 
known 
by 
it, 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same.” 
This 
is 
not 
my 
opinion. 
Mind 
and 
body 
are 
not 
the 
same 
any 
more 
than 
are 
the 
principle 
of 
action 
and 
that 
of 
passion. 
Corporeal 
substance 
has 
a 
soul 
and 
an 
organic 
body, 
that 
is, 
a 
mass 
made 
up 
of 
other 
substances. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
same 
substance 
thinks 
and 
has 
an 
extended 
mass 
joined 
to 
it, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
consist 
of 
this 
mass, 
since 
all 
this 
can 
he 
taken 
away 
from 
it, 
without 
altering 
the 
substance; 
moreover, 
every 
substance 
perceives, 
but 
not 
every 
substance 
thinks. 
Thought 
indeed 
belongs 
tothemonads, 
especiallyallperception,butextensionbelongsto 
compounds. 
It 
can 
no 
more 
be 
said 
that 
God 
and 
the 
things 
known 
by 
God 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
than 
that 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
things 
perceived 
by 
the 
mind 
are 
the 
same. 
The 
author 
[Wachter] 
believes 
that 
Spinoza 
posited 
a 
common 
nature 
in 
which 
the 
attributes 
thought 
and 
extension 
reside, 
and 
that 
this 
nature 
is 
spiritual; 
but 
there 
is 
no 
extension 
belonging 
to 
spirits 
unless 
the 
word 
he 
taken 
in 
a 
broader 
sense 
for 
a 
certain 
subtile 
animal 
such 
as 
angels 
were 



regarded 
by 
the 
ancients.. 
The 
author 
[Wachter] 
adds 
that 
mind 
and 
body 
are 
the 
modes 
of 
these 
attributes. 
But 
how, 
I 
ask, 
can 
the 
mind 
be 
the 
mode 
of 
thought, 
when 
it 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
thought? 
Thus 
the 
mind 
should 
rather 
be 
the 
attribute 
and 
thought 
the 
modification 
of 
this 
attribute. 
It 
is 
astonishing 
also 
that 
Spinoza, 
as 
was 
seen 
above 
(de 
Emend. 
Intel. 
p. 
385), 
seems 
to 
deny 
that 
extension 
is 
divisible 
into 
and 
composed 
of 
parts; 
which 
has 
no 
meaning, 
unless, 
perchance, 
like 
space, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
divisible 
thing. 
But 
space 
and 
time 
areordersof 
thingsandnotthings. 


Theauthor[Wachter] 
rightlysays, 
thatGod 
found 
inhimselftheoriginsof 
all 
things, 
as 
I 
remember 
Julius 
Scaliger 
once 
said 
that 
“things 
are 
not 
produced 
by 
the 
passive 
power 
of 
matter 
but 
by 
the 
active 
power 
of 
God.”.

What 
Spinoza 
(Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 
34) 
says, 
that 
“God 
is, 
by 
the 
same 
necessity, 
the 
cause 
of 
himself 
and 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
things,” 
and 
(Polit. 
Tract. 


p. 
270, 
c. 
2, 
no. 
2) 
that 
“the 
power 
of 
things 
is 
the 
power 
of 
God,” 
I 
do 
not 
admit. 
God 
exists 
necessarily, 
but 
he 
produces 
things 
freely, 
and 
the 
power 
of 
things 
is 
produced 
by 
God 
but 
is 
different 
from 
the 
divine 
power, 
and 
things 
themselvesoperate, 
althoughthey 
havereceivedtheirpowertoact. 
Spinoza 
(Ep. 
21) 
says: 
“That 
everything 
is 
in 
God 
and 
moves 
in 
God, 
I 
assert 
with 
Paul 
and 
perhaps 
with 
all 
other 
philosophers, 
although 
in 
a 
different 
manner. 
I 
would 
even 
dare 
to 
say 
that 
this 
was 
the 
opinion 
of 
all 
the 
ancient 
Hebrews, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
can 
be 
conjectured 
from 
certain 
traditions, 
although 
these 
arein 
many 
ways 
corrupted.” 
Ithinkthateverything 
isin 
God, 
not 
as 
the 
part 
in 
the 
whole, 
nor 
as 
an 
accident 
in 
a 
subject, 
but 
as 
place, 
yet 
a 
place 
spiritual 
and 
enduring 
and 
not 
one 
measured 
or 
divided, 
is 
in 
that 
which 
is 
placed, 
namely, 
just 
as 
God 
is 
immense 
oreverywhere; 
the 
worldispresent 
to 
him. 
And 
it 
is 
thus 
that 
all 
things 
are 
in 
him; 
for 
he 
is 
where 
they 
are 
and 



where 
they 
are 
not, 
and 
he 
remains 
when 
they 
pass 
away 
and 
he 
has 
already 
beentherewhere 
theycome. 


The 
author 
[Wachter] 
says 
that 
it 
is 
the 
concordant 
opinion 
of 
the 
cabalists 
that 
God 
produced 
certain 
things 
mediately 
and 
others 
immediately. 
Whence 
he 
next 
speaks 
of 
a 
certain 
created 
first 
principle 
which 
God 
made 
to 
proceed 
immediately 
from 
himself 
and 
by 
the 
mediation 
of 
which 
all 
other 
things 
have 
been 
produced 
in 
series 
and 
in 
order, 
and 
this 
they 
are 
wont 
to 
salute 
by 
various 
names: 
Adam 
Cadmon, 
Messiah, 
the 
Christ, 
λογος;, 
the 
word, 
the 
first-born, 
the 
first 
man, 
the 
celestial 
man, 
the 
guide, 
the 
shepherd, 
the 
mediator, 
etc. 
Elsewhere 
he 
gives 
a 
reason 
for 
this 
assertion. 
The 
fact 
itself 
is 
recognized 
by 
Spinoza, 
so 
that 
nothing 
is 
wanting 
except 
the 
name. 
“It 
follows,” 
he 
says 
(Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 
28, 
schol.), 
“in 
the 
second 
place, 
that 
God 
cannot 
properly 
be 
called 
the 
remote 
cause 
of 
individual 
things, 
except 
to 
distinguish 
these 
from 
those 
which 
God 
produces 
immediately 
or 
rather 
which 
follow 
from 
his 
absolute 
nature.” 
Moreover 
what 
those 
things 
are 
which 
are 
said 
to 
follow 
from 
the 
absolute 
nature 
of 
God, 
he 
explained 
(prop. 


21)thus: 
“Allthingswhich 
followfromtheabsolutenatureof 
anyattributeof 
God 
must 
exist 
always 
and 
be 
infinite 
or 
are 
eternal 
and 
infinite 
through 
the 
same 
attribute.” 
— 
These 
propositions 
of 
Spinoza, 
which 
the 
author 
cites, 
are 
wholly 
without 
foundation. 
God 
produces 
no 
infinite 
creature, 
nor 
could 
it 
be 
shown 
or 
pointed 
out 
by 
any 
argument 
in 
what 
respect 
such 
a 
creature 
would 
differ 
fromGod. 
The 
theory 
of 
Spinoza, 
namely, 
that 
from 
each 
attribute 
there 
springs 
a 
particular 
infinite 
thing, 
from 
extension 
a 
certain 
something 
infinite 
in 
extension, 
from 
thought 
a 
certain 
infinite 
understanding, 
arises 
from 
his 
varied 
imagination 
of 
certain 
heterogeneous 
divine 
attributes, 
like 
thought 
and 
extension, 
and 
perhaps 
innumerable 
others. 
For 
in 
reality 
extension 
is 
not 
an 
attribute 
of 
itself 
since 
it 
is 
only 
the 
repetition 
of 
perceptions. 
An 
infinitely 



ex, 
tended 
thing 
is 
only 
imaginary: 
an 
infinite 
thinking 
being 
is 
God 
himself. 
The 
things 
which 
are 
necessary 
and 
which 
proceed 
from 
the 
infinite 
nature 
of 
God, 
are 
the 
eternal 
truths. 
A 
particular 
creature 
is 
produced 
by 
another, 
and 
this 
again 
by 
another. 
Thus, 
therefore, 
by 
no 
conception, 
could 
we 
reach 
God 
even 
if 
we 
should 
suppose 
a 
progress 
ad 
infinitum, 
and, 
notwithstanding, 
the 
lastnoless 
thantheone 
whichprecedes 
isdependentuponGod. 


Tatian 
says, 
in 
his 
Oration 
to 
the 
Greeks, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
spirit 
dwelling 
in 
the 
stars, 
the 
angels, 
the 
plants, 
the 
waters 
and 
men, 
and 
that 
this 
spirit, 
although 
one 
and 
the 
same, 
contains 
differences 
in 
itself. 
But 
this 
doctrine 
I 
do 
not 
approve. 
It 
is 
the 
error 
of 
the 
world-soul 
universally 
diffused, 
and 
which, 
like 
the 
air 
in 
pneumatic 
organs, 
makes 
different 
sounds 
in 
different 
organs. 
Thus 
when 
a 
pipe 
is 
broken, 
the 
soul 
will 
desert 
it 
and 
will 
return 
into 
the 
world-soul. 
But 
we 
must 
know 
that 
there 
are 
as 
many 
incorporeal 
substances,orifyou 
will,souls,astherearenatural,organicmachines. 


But 
what 
Spinoza 
(Eth. 
pt. 
2, 
prop. 
13, 
schol.) 
says: 
“All 
things, 
although 
in 
different 
degrees, 
are 
animated,” 
rests 
uponanother 
strange 
doctrine, 
“for,” 
he 
says, 
“of 
everything 
there 
is 
necessarily 
in 
God 
an 
idea, 
of 
which 
God 
is 
the 
cause, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
there 
is 
an 
idea 
of 
the 
human 
body.” 
But 
there 
is 
plainly 
no 
reason 
for 
saying 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
an 
idea. 
Ideas 
are 
something 
purely 
abstract, 
like 
numbers 
and 
figures, 
and 
cannot 
act. 
Ideas 
are 
abstract 
and 
numerical: 
the 
idea 
of 
each 
animal 
is 
a 
possibility, 
and 
it 
is 
an 
illusion 
to 
call 
souls 
immortal 
because 
ideas 
are 
eternal, 
as 
if 
the 
soul 
of 
a 
globe 
should 
be 
called 
eternal 
because 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
spherical 
body 
is 
eternal. 
The 
soul 
is 
not 
an 
idea, 
but 
the 
source 
of 
innumerable 
ideas, 
for 
it 
has, 
besides 
the 
present 
idea, 
something 
active, 
or 
the 
production 
of 
new 
ideas. 
But 
according 
to 
Spinoza, 
at 
any 
moment 
the 
soul 
will 
be 
different 
because 
the 
body 
being 
changed 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
body 
is 
different. 
Hence 
it 
is 
not 
strange 
if 
he 



considers 
creatures 
as 
transitory 
modifications. 
— 
The 
soul, 
therefore, 
is 
somethingvitalorsomethingcontainingactiveforce. 


Spinoza 
(Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 
16) 
says: 
“From 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
must 
follow 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
things 
in 
infinite 
modes, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
all 
things 
which 
can 
fall 
under 
infinite 
intellect.” 
This 
is 
a 
most 
false 
opinion, 
and 
this 
error 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
which 
Descartes 
insinuated, 
viz. 
that 
matter 
successively 
assumes 
all 
forms. 
Spinoza 
begins 
where 
Descartes 
ended, 
in 
Naturalism. 
He 
is 
wrong 
also 
in 
saying 
(Ep. 
58) 
that 
“the 
world 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
divine 
nature,” 
although 
he 
almost 
adds 
that 
it 
was 
not 
made 
by 
chance. 
There 
is 
a 
mean 
between 
what 
is 
necessary 
and 
what 
is 
fortuitous, 
namely, 
what 
is 
free. 
The 
world 
is 
a 
voluntary 
effect 
of 
God, 
but 
on 
account 
of 
inclining 
or 
prevailing 
reasons. 
And 
even 
if 
the 
world 
should 
be 
supposed 
perpetual 
nevertheless 
it 
would 
not 
be 
necessary. 
God 
could 
either 
not 
have 
created 
it 
or 
have 
created 
it 
otherwise, 
but 
he 
was 
not 
to 
do 
it. 
Spinoza 
thinks 
(Ep. 
49) 
that 
“God 
produces 
the 
world 
by 
that 
necessity 
by 
which 
he 
knows 
himself.” 
But 
it 
must 
be 
replied 
that 
things 
are 
possible 
in 
many 
ways, 
whereas 
it 
was 
altogether 
impossible 
that 
God 
should 
not 
know 
himself. 
— 
Spinoza 
says 
(Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 
17, 
schol.): 
“I 
know 
that 
there 
are 
many 
who 
believe 
that 
they 
can 
prove 
that 
sovereign 
intelligence 
and 
free 
will 
belong 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
God; 
for 
they 
say 
they 
know 
nothing 
more 
perfect 
to 
attribute 
to 
God 
than 
that 
which 
is 
the 
highest 
perfection 
in 
us..... 
Therefore, 
they 
prefer 
to 
assert 
that 
God 
is 
indifferent 
to 
all 
things, 
and 
that 
he 
creates 
nothing 
except 
what 
he 
has 
decided, 
by 
some 
absolute 
will, 
to 
create. 
But 
I 
think 
I 
have 
shown 
(Prop. 
16) 
sufficiently 
clearly 
that 
all 
things 
follow 
from 
the 
sovereign 
power 
of 
God 
by 
the 
same 
necessity; 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
it 
follows 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
triangle 
that 
its 
three 
angles 
are 
equal 
to 
two 
right 
angles.” 
— 
From 
the 
first 
words 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
Spinoza 
does 
not 
attribute 
to 
God 
intellect 
and 
will. 
He 
is 
right 
in 
denying 
that 
God 
is 
indifferent 
and 



that 
he 
decrees 
anything 
by 
absolute 
will: 
he 
decrees 
by 
a 
will 
which 
is 
based 
on 
reasons. 
That 
things 
proceed 
from 
God 
as 
the 
properties 
of 
a 
triangle 
proceed 
from 
its 
nature 
is 
proved 
by 
no 
argument, 
besides 
there 
is 
no 
analogy 
between 
essencesandexisting 
things. 


In 
the 
scholium 
of 
Proposition 
17, 
Spinoza 
says 
that 
“the 
intellect 
and 
the 
will 
of 
God 
agree 
with 
ours 
only 
in 
name, 
because 
ours 
are 
posterior 
and 
God’s 
are 
prior 
to 
things;” 
but 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
from 
this, 
that 
they 
agree 
only 
in 
name. 
Elsewhere, 
nevertheless, 
he 
says 
that 
“thought 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
God, 
and 
that 
particular 
modes 
of 
thought 
must 
be 
referred 
to 
it 
(Eth. 
pt. 
2, 
prop. 
1).” 
But 
the 
author 
[Wachter] 
thinks 
that 
he 
is 
speaking 
there 
of 
the 
external 
word 
of 
God, 
because 
he 
says 
(Eth. 
pt. 
5) 
“that 
our 
mind 
is 
a 
part 
of 
theinfiniteintellect.” 


“The 
human 
mind,” 
says 
Spinoza 
(Eth. 
pt. 
5, 
prop. 
23, 
proof), 
“cannot 
he 
entirely 
destroyed 
with 
the 
body, 
but 
there 
remains 
something 
of 
it 
which 
is 
eternal. 
But 
this 
has 
no 
relation 
to 
time, 
for 
we 
attribute 
duration 
to 
the 
mind 
only 
during 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
body.” 
In 
the 
scholium 
following, 
he 
adds, 
“This 
idea 
which 
expresses 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
body 
under 
the 
form 
of 
eternity 
[sub 
specie 
aeternitatis] 
is 
a 
certain 
mode 
of 
thought 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
which 
is 
necessarily 
eternal, 
etc.” 
This 
is 
illusory. 
This 
idea 
is 
like 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
sphere, 
the 
eternity 
of 
which 
does 
not 
prejudge 
its 
existence, 
since 
it 
is 
but 
the 
possibility 
of 
an 
ideal 
sphere. 
Thus 
it 
is 
saying 
nothing 
to 
say 
that 
“our 
mind 
is 
eternal 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
expresses 
the 
body 
under 
the 
form 
of 
eternity,” 
and 
it 
would 
be 
likewise 
eternal 
because 
it 
understands 
eternal 
truths 
as 
to 
the 
triangle. 
“Our 
soul 
has 
no 
duration 
nor 
does 
time 
relate 
to 
anything 
beyond 
the 
actual 
existence 
of 
the 
body.” 
Thus 
Spinoza, 
l. 
c. 
who 
thinks 
that 
the 
mind 
perishes 
with 
the 
body 
because 
he 
believes 
that 
only 
a 
single 
body 
remains 
always, 
although 
this 
can 
be 
transformed. 



The 
author 
[Wachter] 
adds: 
“I 
do 
not 
see 
that 
Spinoza 
has 
anywhere 
said 
positively 
that 
minds 
migrate 
from 
one 
body 
into 
another, 
and 
into 
different 
dwellings 
and 
various 
regions 
of 
eternity. 
Nevertheless 
it 
might 
be 
inferred 
from 
his 
thought.” 
But 
he 
errs. 
The 
same 
soul, 
to 
Spinoza, 
cannot 
be 
the 
idea 
of 
another 
body, 
as 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
sphere 
is 
not 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
cylinder. 
The 
soul, 
to 
Spinoza, 
is 
so 
fugitive, 
that 
it 
does 
not 
exist 
even 
in 
the 
present 
moment, 
and 
the 
body 
too 
only 
exists 
in 
idea. 
Spinoza 
says 
[Eth. 
pt. 
5, 
prop. 


2) 
that 
“memory 
and 
imagination 
disappear 
with 
the 
body.” 
But 
I 
for 
my 
part 
think 
that 
some 
imagination 
and 
some 
memory 
always 
remain, 
and 
that, 
without 
them, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
soul. 
It 
must 
not 
be 
believed 
that 
the 
mind 
exists 
without 
feeling 
or 
without 
a 
soul. 
A 
reason 
without 
imagination 
and 
memory 
is 
a 
conclusion 
without’ 
premises. 
Aristotle, 
also, 
thought 
that 
vow, 
mind, 
or 
the 
acting 
intellect 
remains, 
and 
not 
the 
soul. 
But 
the 
soul 
itself 
acts 
and 
the 
mind 
ispassive. 
Spinoza 
(de 
Emend. 
Intel. 
p. 
384) 
says, 
“The 
ancients 
never, 
to 
my 
knowledge, 
conceived, 
as 
we 
do 
here, 
a 
soul 
acting 
according 
to 
certain 
laws 
and 
like 
a 
spiritual 
automat’ 
(he 
meant 
to 
say 
automaton). 
The 
author 
[Wachter] 
interprets 
this 
passage 
of 
the 
soul 
alone 
and 
not 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
says 
that 
the 
soul 
acts 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
motion 
and 
according 
to 
external 
causes. 
Both 
are 
mistaken. 
I 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
acts 
spontaneously 
and 
yet 
like 
a 
spiritual 
automaton; 
and 
that 
this 
is 
true 
also 
of 
the 
mind. 
The 
soul 
is 
not 
less 
exempt 
than 
the 
mind 
from 
impulses 
from 
external 
things, 
and 
the 
soul 
no 
more 
than 
the 
mind 
acts 
determinately; 
as 
in 
bodies 
everything 
is 
done 
by 
motions 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
force, 
so 
in 
the 
soul 
everything 
is 
done 
through 
effort 
or 
desire, 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
Good. 
The 
two 
realms 
are 
in 
harmony. 
It 
is 
true, 
nevertheless, 
that 
there 
are 
certain 
things 
in 
the 
soul 
which 
cannot 
be 
explained 
in 
an 
adequate 
manner 
except 
by 
external 
things, 
and 
so 
far 
the 
soul 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
external; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
by 
a 



physical 
influx, 
but 
so 
to 
speak 
by 
a 
moral, 
in 
so 
far, 
namely, 
as 
God, 
in 
creating 
the 
mind, 
had 
more 
regard 
to 
other 
things 
than 
to 
it 
itself. 
For 
in 
the 
creation 
andpreservationofeach 
thing 
hehasregardto 
all 
other 
things. 


Spinoza 
is 
wrong 
in 
calling 
[Eth. 
pt. 
3, 
9, 
schol.] 
the 
will 
the 
effort 
of 
each 
thingtopersistin 
its 
being; 
for 
thewilltends 
toward 
more 
particularends 
and 
a 
more 
perfect 
mode 
of 
existence. 
He 
is 
wrong 
also 
in 
saying 
[pt. 
3, 
prop. 
7] 
that 
the 
effort 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
essence, 
whereas 
the 
essence 
is 
always 
the 
same 
and 
efforts 
vary. 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
that 
affirmation 
is 
the 
effort 
of 
the 
mind 
to 
persist 
in 
its 
being, 
that 
is, 
to 
preserve 
its 
ideas. 
We 
have 
this 
effort 
even 
when 
we 
affirm 
nothing. 
Moreover, 
with 
Spinoza, 
the 
mind 
is 
an 
idea, 
it 
does 
not 
have 
ideas. 
He 
is 
also 
wrong 
in 
thinking 
that 
affirmation 
or 
negation 
is 
volition, 
since, 
moreover, 
volition 
involves, 
in 
addition, 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
Good. 


Spinoza 
(Ep. 
2, 
ad 
Oldenb.) 
says 
that 
“the 
will 
differs 
from 
this 
or 
that 
volition, 
just 
as 
whiteness 
from 
this 
or 
that 
white 
color: 
consequently, 
will 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
volition, 
as 
humanity 
is 
not 
the 
cause 
of 
Peter 
and 
of 
Paul. 
Particular 
volitions 
have 
therefore 
need 
of 
another 
cause. 
The 
will 
is 
only 
an 
entity 
of 
reason.” 
So 
Spinoza. 
But 
we 
take 
the 
will 
for 
the 
power 
of 
choosing, 
the 
exercise 
of 
which 
is 
the 
volition. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
indeed 
by 
the 
will 
that 
we 
will; 
but 
it 
is 
true 
that 
there 
is 
need 
of 
other 
special 
causes 
to 
determine 
the 
will, 
namely, 
in 
order 
that 
it 
produce 
a 
certain 
volition. 
It 
must 
be 
modified 
in 
a 
certain 
manner. 
The 
will 
does 
not 
therefore 
stand 
to 
volitions 
as 
the 
species 
or 
the 
abstract 
of 
the 
species 
to 
individuals. 
Mistakes 
are 
not 
free 
nor 
acts 
of 
will,althoughoftenweconcurinourerrors 
by 
freeactions. 


Further, 
Spinoza 
says 
(Tract. 
Polit. 
c. 
2, 
no. 
6), 
“Men 
conceive 
themselves 
in 
nature 
as 
an 
empire 
within 
an 
empire 
(Malcuth 
in 
Malcuth, 
adds 
the 
author). 
For 
they 
think 
that 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
not 
the 
product 
of 
natural 
causes, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
immediately 
created 
by 
God 
so 
independent 
of 
other 



things 
that 
it 
has 
absolute 
power 
of 
determining 
itself 
and 
of 
using 
rightly 
its 
reason. 
But 
experience 
proves 
to 
us 
over-abundantly 
that 
it 
is 
no 
more 
in 
our 
power 
to 
have 
a 
sound 
mind 
than 
to 
have 
a 
sound 
body.” 
So 
Spinoza. 
In 
my 
opinion, 
each 
substance 
is 
an 
empire 
within 
an 
empire; 
but 
harmonizing 
exactly 
with 
all 
the 
rest 
it 
receives 
no 
influence 
from 
any 
being 
except 
it 
be 
from 
God, 
but, 
nevertheless, 
through 
God, 
its 
author, 
it 
depends 
upon 
all 
the 
others. 
It 
comes 
immediately 
from 
God 
and 
yet 
it 
is 
created 
conformed 
to 
the 
other 
things. 
For 
the 
rest, 
not 
all 
things 
are 
equally 
in 
our 
power. 
For 
we 
are 
inclined 
more 
to 
this 
or 
to 
that. 
Malcuth, 
or 
the 
realm 
of 
God, 
does 
not 
suppress 
either 
divine 
or 
human 
liberty, 
but 
only 
the 
indifference 
of 
equilibrium, 
as 
they 
say 
who 
think 
there 
are 
no 
reasons 
for 
those 
actions 
which 
theydonotunderstand. 


Spinoza 
thinks 
that 
the 
mind 
is 
greatly 
strengthened 
if 
it 
knows 
that 
what 
happens 
happens 
necessarily: 
but 
by 
this 
compulsion 
he 
does 
not 
render 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
sufferer 
content 
nor 
cause 
him 
to 
feel 
his 
malady 
the 
less. 
He 
is, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
happy 
if 
he 
understands 
that’ 
good 
results 
from 
evil 
and 
that 
thosethings 
whichhappen 
arethebestfor 
usif 
we 
arewise. 


From 
what 
precedes 
it 
is 
seen 
that 
what 
Spinoza 
says 
on 
the 
intellectual 
love 
of 
God 
(Eth. 
pt. 
4, 
prop. 
28) 
is 
only 
trappings 
for 
the 
people, 
since 
there 
is 
nothing 
loveable 
in 
a 
God 
who 
produces 
without 
choice 
and 
by 
necessity, 
without 
discrimination 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 
The 
true 
love 
of 
God 
is 
founded 
not 
in 
necessity 
but 
in 
‘goodness. 
Spinoza 
(de 
Emend. 
Intel. 
p. 
388), 
says 
that 
“there 
is 
no 
science, 
but 
that 
we 
have 
only 
experience 
of 
particular 
things, 
that 
is, 
of 
things 
such 
that 
their 
existence 
has 
no 
connection 
with 
their 
essence, 
and 
which, 
consequently, 
are 
not 
eternal 
truths.” 
— 
This 
contradicts 
what 
he 
said 
elsewhere, 
viz: 
that 
all 
things 
are 
necessary, 
that 
all 
things 
proceed 
necessarily 
from 
the 
divine 
essence. 
Likewise 
he 
combats 
(Eth. 
pt. 
2, 
prop. 
10, 
schol.) 
those 
who 
pretend 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
God 
belongs 
to 
the 



essence 
of 
created 
things, 
and 
yet 
he 
had 
established 
before 
[Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 


15] 
that 
things 
do 
not 
exist 
and 
cannot 
be 
conceived 
without 
God, 
and 
that 
they 
necessarily 
arise 
from 
him. 
He 
maintains 
(Eth. 
pt. 
1, 
prop. 
21), 
for 
this 
reason, 
that 
finite 
and 
temporal 
things 
cannot 
be 
produced 
immediately 
by 
an 
infinite 
cause, 
but 
that 
(Prop. 
28) 
they 
are 
produced 
by 
other 
causes, 
individual 
and 
finite. 
But 
how 
will 
they 
finally 
then 
spring 
from 
God? 
for 
they 
cannot 
come 
from 
him 
mediately 
in 
this 
case, 
since 
we 
could 
never 
reach 
in 
this 
way 
things 
which 
are 
not 
similarly 
produced 
by 
another 
finite 
thing. 
It 
cannot, 
therefore, 
be 
said 
that 
God 
acts 
by 
mediating 
second 
causes, 
unless 
he 
produces 
second 
causes. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
rather 
to 
be 
said

REMARKSON 
THE 
OPINION 
OF 
MALEBRANCHE 
THAT 
WE 
SEE 
ALL 
THINGS 
IN 
GOD, 
WITHREFERENCE 
TO 
LOCKE’S 
EXAMINATION 
OF 
IT. 
1708. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



THERE 
IS, 
IN 
the 
posthumous 
works 
of 
Locke 
published 
at 
London 
in 
1706, 
8vo. 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
Malebranche 
that 
we 
see 
all 
things 
in 
God. 
It 
is 
acknowledged 
at 
the 
start 
that 
there 
are 
many 
nice 
thoughts 
and 
judicious 
reflections 
in 
the 
book 
on 
The 
Search 
after 
Truth, 
and 
that 
this 
made 
him 
hope 
to 
find 
therein 
something 
satisfactory 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
our 
ideas. 
But 
he 
has 
remarked 
at 
the 
beginning 
(§ 
2) 
that 
this 
Father 
[Malebranche] 
makes 
use 
of 
what 
Locke 
calls 
the 
argumentum 
ad 
ignorantiam, 
in 
pretending 
to 
prove 
his 
opinion, 
because 
there 
is 
no 
other 
means 
of 
explaining 
the 
thing; 
but 
according 
to 
Mr. 
Locke, 
this 
argument 
loses 
its 
force 
when 
the 
feebleness 
of 
our 
understanding 
is 
considered. 
I 
am 
nevertheless 
of 
opinion 
that 
this 
argument 
is 
good 
if 
one 
can 
perfectly 
enumerate 
the 
means 
and 
exclude 
all 
but 
one. 
Even 
in 
Analysis, 
M. 
Frenicle 
employed 
this 
method 
of 
exclusion, 
as 
he 
called 
it. 
Nevertheless 
Locke 
is 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
of 
no 
use 
to 
say 
that 
this 
hypothesis 
is 
better 
than 
the 
other, 
if 
it 
is 
found 
not 
to 
explain 
what 
one 
would 
like 
to 
understand 
and 
even 
toinvolvethingswhichcannotharmonize. 


After 
having 
considered 
what 
is 
said 
in 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
the 
second 
part 
of 
hook 
third, 
where 
Malebranche 
claims 
that 
what 
the 
soul 
can 
perceive 
must 
be 
in 
immediate 
contact 
with 
it, 
Mr. 
Locke 
asks 
(§ 
3, 
4.) 
what 
it 
is 
to 
be 
in 
immediate 
contact, 
this 
not 
appearing 
to 
him 
intelligible 
except 
in 
bodies. 
Perhaps 
it 
might 
be, 
replied 
that 
one 
acts 
immediately 
on 
the 
other. 
And 
as 



Malebranche, 
admitting 
that 
our 
bodies 
are 
united 
to 
our 
souls, 
adds 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
the 
soul 
perceives 
it, 
he 
is 
asked 
(§ 
5.) 
to 
explain 
that 
act 
of 
union 
or 
at 
least 
in 
what 
it 
differs 
from 
that 
which 
he 
does 
not 
admit? 
Father 
Malebranche 
will 
perhaps 
say 
that 
he 
does 
not 
know 
the 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
the 
body 
except 
by 
faith, 
and 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
body 
consisting 
in 
extension 
alone, 
nothing 
can 
be 
deduced 
therefrom 
toward 
explaining 
the 
soul’s 
action 
on 
the 
body. 
He 
grants 
an 
inexplicable 
union, 
but 
he 
demands 
one 
which 
shall 
serve 
to 
explain 
the 
commerce 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
body. 
He 
claims 
also 
to 
explain 
why 
material 
beings 
could 
not 
be 
united 
with 
the 
soul 
as 
is 
demanded; 
this 
is 
because 
these 
beings 
being 
extended 
and 
the 
soul 
not 
being 
so, 
there 
is 
no 
relation 
between 
them. 
But 
thereupon 
Locke 
asks 
very 
apropos 
(§ 
7.) 
if 
there 
is 
any 
more 
relation 
between 
God 
and 
the 
soul. 
It 
seems 
indeed 
that 
the 
Reverend 
Father 
Malebranche 
ought 
to 
have 
urged 
not 
the 
little 
relation, 
but 
the 
little 
connection, 
which 
appears 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
while 
between 
God 
and 
the 
creatures 
there 
is 
a 
connection 
such 
that 
theycouldnotexistwithouthim. 


When 
the 
Father 
says 
(§ 
6.) 
that 
there 
is 
no 
purely 
intelligible 
substance 
except 
God, 
I 
declare 
that 
I 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
understand 
him. 
There 
is 
something 
in 
the 
soul 
that 
we 
do 
not 
distinctly 
understand; 
and 
there 
are 
manythings 
inGod 
thatwedonotat 
all 
understand. 


Mr. 
Locke 
(§ 
8.) 
makes 
a 
remark 
on 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Father’s 
chapter 
which 
is 
tantamount 
to 
my 
views; 
for 
in 
order 
to 
show 
that 
the 
Father 
has 
not 
excluded 
all 
the 
means 
of 
explaining 
the 
matter, 
he 
adds: 
“If 
I 
should 
say 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
God 
has 
made 
our 
souls 
such 
and 
has 
so 
united 
them 
to 
bodies 
that 
at 
certain 
motions 
of 
the 
body 
the 
soul 
should 
have 
such 
and 
such 
perceptions 
but 
in 
a 
manner 
inconceivable 
to 
us, 
I 
should 
have 
said 
something 
as 
apparent 
and 
as 
instructive 
as 
that 
which 
he 
says.” 
Mr. 
Locke 
in 



saying 
this 
seems 
to 
have 
had 
in 
mind 
my 
system 
of 
Pre-established 
Harmony,orsomething 
similar. 


Mr. 
Locke 
objects(§20.)thatthesun 
isuselessifweseeitin 
God. 
As 
this 
argument 
applies 
also 
against 
my 
system, 
which 
claims 
that 
we 
see 
the 
sun 
in 
us, 
I 
answer 
that 
the 
sun 
is 
not 
made 
solely 
for 
us 
and 
that 
God 
wishes 
to 
showusthetruth 
astowhatiswithoutus. 


He 
objects 
also 
(§22.) 
that 
he 
does 
not 
conceive 
how 
we 
could 
see 
somethingconfusedlyinGod, 
wherethereis 
noconfusion. 
One 
mightanswer 
that 
we 
seethingsconfusedly 
when 
we 
seetoomanyof 
them 
ata 
time. 


Father 
Malebranche 
having 
said 
that 
God 
is 
the 
place 
of 
spirits 
as 
space 
is 
the 
place 
of 
bodies, 
Mr. 
Locke 
says 
(§ 
25.) 
that 
he 
does 
not 
understand 
a 
word 
of 
this. 
But 
he 
understands 
at 
least 
what 
space, 
place 
and 
body 
are. 
He 
understands 
also 
that 
the 
Father 
draws 
an 
analogy 
between 
space, 
place, 
body 
and 
between 
God, 
place, 
spirit. 
Thus 
a 
good 
part 
of 
what 
he 
here 
says 
is 
intelligible. 
It 
may 
merely 
be 
objected 
that 
this 
analogy 
is 
not 
proven, 
although 
some 
relations 
are 
easily 
perceived 
which 
might 
give 
occasion 
for 
the 
comparison. 
I 
often 
observe 
that 
certain 
persons 
seek 
by 
this 
affectation 
of 
ignorance 
to 
elude 
what 
is 
said 
to 
them 
as 
if 
they 
understood 
nothing; 
they 
do 
this 
notto 
reproach 
themselves, 
but 
either 
to 
reproachthose 
speaking, 
as 
if 
their 
jargon 
was 
unintelligible, 
or 
to 
exalt 
themselves 
above 
the 
matter 
and 
thosewho 
tellit,asifit 
wasnotworthyof 
theirattention. 


Nevertheless 
Mr. 
Locke 
is 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
the 
opinion 
of 
Father 
Malebranche 
is 
unintelligible 
in 
connection 
with 
his 
other 
opinions, 
since 
with 
him 
space 
and 
body 
are 
the 
same 
thing. 
The 
truth 
has 
escaped 
him 
here 
and 
he 
has 
conceived 
something 
common 
and 
immutable, 
to 
which 
bodies 
have 
an 
essential 
relation 
and 
which 
indeed 
produces 
their 
relation 
to 
one 
another. 
This 
order 
gives 
occasion 
for 
making 
a 
fiction 
and 
for 
conceiving 
space 
as 
an 
immutable 
substance; 
but 
what 
there 
is 
real 
in 
this 
notion 
relates 



to 
simple 
substances 
(under 
which 
spirits 
are 
included), 
and 
is 
found 
in 
God, 
whounitesthem. 


The 
Father 
saying 
that 
ideas 
are 
representative 
beings, 
Mr. 
Locke 
asks 
(§ 
26.) 
If 
these 
beings 
are 
substances, 
modes 
or 
relations? 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
they 
are 
nothing 
but 
relations 
resulting 
from 
the 
attributes 
of 
God. 


When 
Mr. 
Locke 
declares 
(§31.) 
that 
he 
does 
not 
understand 
how 
the 
varietyofideasiscompatiblewith 
the 
simplicityofGod,itappearstomethat 
he 
ought 
not 
raise 
an 
objection 
on 
this 
score 
against 
Father 
Malebranche, 
for 
there 
is 
no 
system 
which 
can 
make 
such 
a 
thing 
comprehensible. 
We 
cannot 
comprehend 
the 
incommensurable 
and 
a 
thousand 
other 
things, 
the 
truth 
of 
which 
we 
nevertheless 
know, 
and 
which 
we 
are 
right 
in 
employing 
to 
explain 
others 
which 
are 
dependent 
on 
them. 
There 
is 
something 
approaching 
to 
this 
in 
all 
simple 
substances; 
where 
there 
is 
variety 
of 
affections 
in 
unity 
of 
substance. 


The 
Father 
maintains 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
infinite 
is 
prior 
to 
that 
of 
the 
finite. 
Mr. 
Locke 
objects 
(§ 
34.) 
that 
a 
child 
has 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
number 
or 
of 
a 
square 
sooner 
than 
that 
of 
the 
infinite. 
He 
is 
right 
in 
taking 
the 
ideas 
for 
images; 
but 
in 
taking 
them 
as 
the 
foundations 
of 
notions, 
he 
will 
find 
that 
in 
the 
continuum 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
extended, 
taken 
absolutely, 
is 
prior 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
extended 
where 
the 
modification 
is 
added. 
This 
must 
he 
further 
appliedtowhat 
issaid 
in§§42. 
and 
46. 


The 
argument 
of 
the 
Father 
which 
Mr. 
Locke 
examines 
(§40.), 
that 
God 
alone, 
being 
the 
end 
of 
spirits, 
is 
also 
their 
sole 
object, 
is 
not 
to 
be 
despised. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
it 
needs 
something 
in 
order 
to 
be 
called 
a 
demonstration. 
There 
is 
a 
more 
conclusive 
reason 
which 
shows 
that 
God 
is 
the 
sole 
immediate 
external 
object 
of 
spirits, 
and 
that 
is 
that 
there 
is 
naught 
but 
he 
which 
can 
act 
onthem. 



It 
is 
objected 
(§ 
41.) 
that 
the 
Apostle 
begins 
with 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
creatures 
in 
order 
to 
lead 
to 
God 
and 
that 
the 
Father 
does 
the 
contrary. 
I 
believe 
that 
these 
methods 
harmonize. 
The 
one 
proceeds 
a 
priori, 
the 
other 
a 
posteriori; 
and 
the 
latter 
is 
the 
more 
common. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
best 
way 
to 
know 
things 
is 
through 
their 
causes; 
but 
this 
is 
not 
the 
easiest. 
It 
requires 
too 
muchattentionto 
thingsofsense. 


In 
replying 
to 
§ 
34. 
I 
have 
noticed 
the 
difference 
there 
is 
between 
image 
and 
idea. 
It 
seems 
that 
this 
difference 
is 
combated 
(§ 
38.) 
by 
finding 
difficulty 
in 
the 
difference 
which 
there 
is 
between 
image 
[sentiment] 
and 
idea. 
But 
I 
think 
that 
the 
Father 
understands 
by 
image 
[sentiment]a 
perception 
of 
the 
imagination, 
whereas 
there 
may 
be 
ideas 
of 
things 
which 
are 
not 
sensible 
nor 
imageable. 
I 
affirm 
that 
we 
have 
as 
clear 
an 
idea 
of 
the 
color 
of 
the 
violet 
as 
of 
its 
figure 
(as 
is 
objected 
here) 
but 
not 
as 
distinct 
nor 
asintelligible. 


Mr. 
Locke 
asks 
if 
an 
indivisible 
and 
unextended 
substance 
can 
have 
at 
the 
same 
time 
different 
modifications 
relating 
to 
inconsistent 
objects. 
I 
reply, 
Yes. 
That 
which 
is 
inconsistent 
in 
the 
same 
object 
is 
not 
inconsistent 
in 
the 
representation 
of 
different 
objects, 
conceived 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
It 
is 
not 
therefore 
necessary 
that 
there 
he 
different 
parts 
in 
the 
soul 
as 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
that 
there 
be 
different 
parts 
in 
a 
point 
although 
different 
angles 
cometogetherthere. 


It 
is 
asked 
with 
reason 
(§ 
43.) 
how 
we 
know 
the 
creature 
if 
we 
do 
not 
see 
immediately 
aught 
but 
God? 
Because 
the 
objects, 
the 
representation 
of 
which 
God 
causes 
us 
to 
have, 
have 
something 
which 
resembles 
the 
idea 
we 
have 
of 
substance,andit 
isthiswhich 
makesusjudgethatthereare 
other 
substances. 


It 
issupposed 
(§46.)that 
Godhastheideaofan 
angle 
whichis 
the 
nearest 
to 
the 
right 
angle, 
but 
that 
he 
does 
not 
show 
it 
to 
anyone, 
however 
one 
may 
desire 
to 
have 
it. 
I 
reply 
that 
such 
an 
angle 
is 
a 
fiction, 
like 
the 
fraction 



nearest 
to 
unity, 
or 
the 
number 
nearest 
to 
zero, 
or 
the 
least 
of 
all 
numbers. 
Thenatureofcontinuitydoes 
notpermitanysuchthing. 


The 
Father 
had 
said 
that 
we 
know 
our 
soul 
by 
an 
inner 
feeling 
of 
consciousness, 
and 
that 
for 
this 
reason 
the 
knowledge 
of 
our 
soul 
is 
more 
imperfect 
than 
that 
of 
things, 
which 
we 
know 
in 
God. 
Mr. 
Locke 
then 
remarks 
very 
apropos 
(§ 
47.) 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
our 
soul 
being 
in 
God 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
other 
things, 
we 
should 
see 
it 
also 
in 
God. 
The 
truth 
is 
that 
we 
see 
all 
things 
in 
ourselves 
and 
in 
our 
souls, 
and 
that 
the 
knowledge 
which 
we 
have 
of 
the 
soul 
is 
very 
true 
and 
just 
provided 
that 
we 
attend 
to 
it; 
that 
it 
is 
by 
the 
knowledge 
which 
we 
have 
of 
the 
soul 
that 
we 
know 
being, 
substance, 
God 
himself, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
by 
reflection 
on 
our 
thoughts 
that 
we 
know 
extension 
and 
bodies; 
that 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
true 
that 
God 
gives 
us 
all 
there 
is 
that 
is 
positive 
in 
this, 
and 
all 
perfection 
therein 
involved, 
by 
an 
immediate 
and 
continual 
emanation, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
dependence 
on 
him 
which 
all 
creatures 
have, 
and 
it 
is 
thus 
that 
a 
good 
meaning 
may 
be 
given 
to 
the 
phrase 
that 
God 
is 
theobjectofoursoulsandthat 
we 
seeallthingsin 
him. 


Perhaps 
the 
design 
of 
the 
Father 
in 
the 
saying 
which 
is 
examined 
(§ 
53.), 
that 
we 
see 
the 
essences 
of 
things 
in 
the 
perfections 
of 
God 
and 
that 
it 
is 
the 
universal 
reason 
which 
enlightens 
us, 
tends 
to 
show 
that 
the 
attributes 
of 
God 
are 
the 
bases 
of 
the 
simple 
notions 
which 
we 
have 
of 
things, 
— 
being, 
power, 
knowledge, 
diffusion, 
duration, 
taken 
absolutely, 
being 
in 
him 
and 
not

LETTER 
TO 
WAGNER 
ON 
THE 
ACTIVE 
FORCE 
OF 
BODY, 
ON 
THE 
SOUL 
AND 
ON 
THE 
SOUL 
OF 
BRUTES. 
1710. 


[From 
the 
Latin.] 



1. 
I 
WILLINGLY 
reply 
to 
the 
inquiries 
you 
make 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
soul, 
for 
I 
see 
from 
the 
doubt 
which 
you 
present 
that 
my 
view 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
clear 
to 
you,and 
that 
this 
is 
due 
to 
some 
prejudgment 
drawn 
from 
my 
essay, 
inserted 
in 
the 
Acta 
Eruditorum, 
wherein 
I 
treated, 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
illustrious 
Sturm, 
of 
the 
active 
force 
of 
body. 
You 
say 
that 
I 
have 
not 
there 
sufficiently 
vindicated 
active 
force 
for 
matter, 
and 
while 
I 
attribute 
resistance 
to 
matter 
I 
have 
also 
attributed 
reaction 
to 
the 
same, 
and 
consequently 
action; 
since 
therefore 
there 
is 
everywhere 
in 
matter 
an 
active 
principle, 
this 
principle 
seems 
to 
suffice 
for 
the 
actions 
of 
brutes, 
nor 
is 
there 
needin 
them 
ofanincorruptiblesoul. 
2. 
I 
reply, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
that 
the 
active 
principle 
is 
not 
attributed 
by 
me 
to 
bare 
or 
primary 
matter, 
which 
is 
merely 
passive, 
and 
consists 
only 
in 
antitypia 
and 
extension; 
but 
to 
body 
or 
to 
clothed 
or 
secondary 
matter 
which 
in 
addition 
contains 
a 
primitive 
entelechy 
or 
active 
principle. 
I 
reply, 
secondly, 
that 
the 
resistance 
of 
bare 
matter 
is 
not 
action, 
but 
mere 
passion, 
inasmuch 
as 
it 
has 
antitypia 
or 
impenetrability, 
by 
which 
indeed 
it 
resists 
whatever 
would 
penetrate 
it 
but 
does 
not 
react, 
unless 
there 
be 
added 
an 
elastic 
force, 
which 
must 
be 
derived 
from 
motion, 
and 
therefore 
the 
active 
force 
of 
matter 
must 
be 
superadded. 
I 
reply, 
thirdly, 
that 
this 
active 
principle, 
this 
first 
entelechy, 
is, 
in 
fact, 
a 
vital 
principle, 
endowed 
also 
with 
the 
faculty 
ofperception,andincorruptible, 
for 
reasons 
recentlystatedbyme. 
Andthis 
is 

the 
very 
thing 
which 
in 
brutes 
I 
hold 
for 
their 
soul. 
While, 
therefore, 
I 
admit 
active 
principles 
superadded 
everywhere 
in 
matter, 
I 
also 
posit, 
everywhere 
disseminated 
through 
it, 
vital 
or 
percipient 
principles, 
and 
thus 
monads, 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
metaphysical 
atoms 
wanting 
parts 
and 
incapable 
of 
being 
producedor 
destroyed 
naturally. 


3. 
You 
next 
ask 
my 
definition 
of 
soul. 
I 
reply 
that 
soul 
may 
be 
employed 
in 
a 
broad 
and 
in 
a 
strict 
sense. 
Broadly 
speaking, 
soul 
will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
life 
or 
vital 
principle, 
that 
is, 
the 
principle 
of 
internal 
action 
existing 
in 
the 
simple 
thing 
or 
monad, 
to 
which 
external 
action 
corresponds. 
And 
this 
correspondence 
of 
internal 
and 
external, 
or 
representation 
of 
the 
external 
in 
the 
internal, 
of 
the 
composite 
in 
the 
simple, 
of 
multiplicity 
in 
unity, 
constitutes 
in 
reality 
perception. 
But 
in 
this 
sense, 
soul 
is 
attributed 
not 
only 
to 
animals 
but 
also 
to 
all 
other 
percipient 
beings. 
In 
the 
strict 
sense, 
soul 
is 
employed 
as 
a 
nobler 
species 
of 
life, 
or 
sentient 
life, 
where 
there 
is 
not 
only 
the 
faculty 
of 
perceiving, 
but 
in 
addition 
that 
of 
feeling, 
inasmuch, 
indeed, 
as 
attention 
and 
memory 
are 
joined 
to 
perception. 
Just 
as, 
in 
turn, 
mind 
is 
a 
nobler 
species 
of 
soul, 
that 
is, 
mind 
is 
rational 
soul, 
where 
reason 
or 
ratiocination 
from 
universality 
of 
truths 
is 
added 
to 
feeling. 
As 
therefore 
mind 
is 
rational 
soul, 
so 
soul 
is 
sentient 
life, 
and 
life 
is 
perceptive 
principle. 
I 
have 
shown, 
moreover, 
by 
examples 
and 
arguments, 
that 
not 
all 
perception 
is 
feeling, 
but 
that 
there 
is 
also 
insensible 
perception. 
For 
example, 
I 
could 
not 
perceive 
green 
unless 
I 
perceived 
blue 
and 
yellow, 
from 
which 
it 
results. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
I 
do 
not 
feel 
blue 
and 
yellow 
unless 
perchance 
a 
microscope 
is 
employed. 
4. 
You 
will 
remember, 
moreover, 
that 
according 
to 
my 
opinion, 
not 
only 
are 
all 
lives, 
all 
souls, 
all 
minds, 
all 
primitive 
entelechies, 
everlasting, 
but 
also 
that 
to 
each 
primitive 
entelechy 
or 
each 
vital 
principle 
there 
is 
perpetually 
united 
a 
certain 
natural 
machine, 
which 
comes 
to 
us 
under 
the 

name 
of 
organic 
body: 
which 
machine, 
moreover, 
even 
although 
it 
preserves 
its 
form 
in 
general, 
remains 
in 
flux, 
and 
is, 
like 
the 
ship 
of 
Theseus, 
perpetually 
repaired. 
Nor 
therefore 
can 
we 
be 
certain 
thatthe 
smallest 
particle 
of 
matter 
received 
by 
us 
at 
birth, 
remains 
in 
our 
body, 
even 
although 
the 
same 
machine 
is 
by 
degrees 
completely 
transformed, 
augmented, 
diminished, 
involved 
or 
evolved. 
Hence, 
not 
only 
is 
the 
soul 
everlasting, 
but 
also 
some 
animal 
always 
remains, 
although 
no 
particular 
animal 
ought 
to 
be 
called 
everlasting, 
since 
the 
animal 
species 
does 
not 
remain; 
just 
as 
the 
caterpillar, 
and 
the 
butterfly 
are 
not 
the 
same 
animal, 
although 
the 
same 
soul 
is 
in 
both. 
Every 
natural 
machine, 
therefore, 
has 
this 
quality, 
that 
it 
is 
never 
completely 
destructible, 
since, 
however 
thick 
a 
covering 
may 
be 
dissolved, 
there 
always 
remains 
a 
little 
machine 
not 
yet 
destroyed, 
like 
the 
costume 
of 
Harlequin, 
in 
the 
comedy, 
to 
whom, 
after 
the 
removal 
of 
many 
tunics, 
there 
always 
remained 
a 
fresh 
one. 
And 
we 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
less 
astonished 
at 
this 
for 
this 
reason, 
that 
nature 
is 
everywhere 
organic 
and 
ordered 
by 
a 
most 
wise 
author 
for 
certain 
ends, 
and 
that 
nothing 
in 
nature 
ought 
to 
be 
criticized 
as 
unpolished, 
although 
it 
may 
sometimes 
appear 
to 
our 
senses 
as 
but 
a 
rude 
mass. 
Thus 
therefore 
we 
escape 
all 
the 
difficulties 
which 
arise 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
soul 
absolutely 
separated 
from 
all 
matter; 
so 
that, 
in 
truth, 
a 
soul 
or 
an 
animal 
before 
birth 
or 
after 
death 
does 
not 
differ 
from 
a 
soul 
or 
an 
animal 
living 
the 
present 
life 
except 
in 
condition 
of 
things 
and 
degrees 
of 
perfections, 
but 
not 
by 
entire 
genus 
of 
being. 
And 
likewise 
I 
think 
that 
Genii 
are 
minds 
endowed 
with 
bodies 
very 
penetrating 
and 
suitable 
for 
action, 
which 
perhaps 
they 
are 
able 
to 
change 
at 
will, 
whence 
they 
do 
not 
deserve 
to 
be 
called 
even 
animals. 
Thus 
all 
things 
in 
nature 
are 
analogous, 
and 
the 
subtile 
may 
be 
understood 
from 
the 
coarse, 
since 
both 
are 
constituted 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
God 
alone 
is 
substance 
really 
separated 
from 
matter, 
since 
he 
is 
actus 
purus, 
endowed 
with 
no 
passive 
power, 
which, 
wherever 
it 
is, 



constitutes 
matter. 
And, 
indeed, 
all 
created 
substances 
have 
antitypia, 
by 
which 
it 
happens 
naturally 
that 
one 
is 
outside 
the 
other, 
and 
so 
penetration 
is 
excluded. 


5. 
But 
although 
my 
principles 
are 
very 
general 
and 
hold 
not 
less 
in 
man 
than 
in 
brutes, 
yet 
man 
stands 
out 
marvellously 
above 
brutes 
and 
approaches 
the 
Genii, 
because 
from 
the 
use 
of 
reason 
he 
is 
capable 
of 
society 
with 
God, 
and 
thus 
of 
reward 
and 
of 
punishment 
in 
the 
divine 
government. 
And 
therefore 
he 
preserves 
not 
only 
life 
and 
soul 
like 
the 
brutes, 
but 
also 
self-
consciousness 
and 
memory 
of 
a 
former 
state, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
personality. 
He 
is 
immortal, 
not 
only 
physically 
but 
also 
morally, 
whence 
in 
the 
strict 
sense 
immortality 
is 
attributed 
only 
to 
the 
human 
soul. 
For 
if 
a 
man 
did 
not 
know 
that 
in 
the 
other 
life 
rewards 
or 
punishments 
would 
be 
awarded 
him 
for 
this 
life, 
there 
would 
really 
be 
no 
punishment, 
no 
reward, 
and 
as 
regards 
morals, 
it 
would 
be 
just 
as 
if 
I 
were 
extinguished 
and 
another, 
happier 
or 
unhappier, 
should 
succeed 
me. 
And 
thus 
I 
hold 
that 
souls, 
latent 
doubtless 
in 
seminal 
animalcules 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
things, 
are 
not 
rational 
until, 
by 
conception, 
they 
are 
destined 
for 
human 
life; 
but 
when 
they 
are 
once 
made 
rational 
and 
rendered 
capable 
of 
consciousness 
and 
of 
society 
with 
God, 
I 
think 
that 
they 
never 
lay 
aside 
the 
character 
of 
citizens 
in 
the 
Republic 
of 
God; 
and 
since 
it 
is 
most 
justly 
and 
beautifully 
governed, 
it 
is 
a 
consequence 
that 
by 
the 
very 
laws 
of 
nature, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
parallelism 
of 
the 
kingdom 
of 
grace 
and 
of 
nature, 
souls 
by 
the 
force 
of 
their 
own 
actions 
are 
rendered 
more 
fit 
for 
rewards 
and 
punishments. 
And 
in 
this 
sense 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
virtue 
brings 
its 
own 
reward 
and 
sin 
its 
own 
punishment, 
since 
by 
a 
certain 
natural 
consequence, 
before 
the 
last 
state 
of 
the 
soul, 
according 
as 
it 
departs 
atoned 
for 
or 
unatoned 
for, 
there 
arises 
a 
certain 
natural 
divergence, 
preordained 
by 
God 
in 
nature 
and 
with 
divine 
promises 
and 
threats, 
and 
consistent 
with 
grace 
and 
justice; 
the 
intervention 
also 
being 
added 
of 
Genii, 

good 
or 
bad 
according 
as 
we 
have 
associated 
with 
either, 
whose 
operations 
are 
certainly 
natural 
although 
their 
nature 
is 
sublimer 
than 
ours. 
“We 
see, 
indeed, 
that 
a 
man 
awaking 
from 
a 
profound 
sleep, 
or 
even 
recovering 
from 
apoplexy, 
is 
wont 
to 
recover 
the 
memory 
of 
his 
former 
state. 
The 
same 
must 
be 
said 
of 
death, 
which 
can 
render 
our 
perceptions 
turbid 
and 
confused 
but 
cannot 
entirely 
blot 
them 
from 
memory, 
the 
use 
of 
which 
returning, 
rewards 
and 
punishments 
take 
place. 
Thus 
the 
Saviour 
compared 
death 
to 
sleep. 
Moreover 
the 
preservation 
of 
personality 
and 
of 
moral 
immortality 
cannot 
be 
attributedtobrutesincapableofthedivinesocietyand 
law. 


6. 
Noone,therefore,need 
feardangerousconsequencesfromthisdoctrine, 
since 
rather 
a 
true 
natural 
theology, 
not 
only 
not 
at 
variance 
with 
revealed 
truth 
but 
even 
wonderfully 
favorable 
to 
it, 
may 
be 
demonstrated 
by 
most 
beautiful 
reasoning 
from 
my 
principles. 
Those 
indeed 
who 
deny 
souls 
to 
brutes 
and 
all 
perception 
and 
organism 
to 
other 
parts 
of 
matter, 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
recognize 
the 
Divine 
Majesty, 
and 
introduce 
something 
unworthy 
of 
God, 
unpolished, 
that 
is, 
a 
void 
of 
perfections 
or 
forms, 
which 
you 
may 
call 
a 
metaphysical 
void, 
which 
is 
no 
less 
to 
be 
rejected 
than 
a 
material 
or 
physical 
void. 
But 
those 
who 
grant 
true 
soul 
and 
perception 
to 
brutes 
and 
yet 
affirm 
that 
their 
souls 
can 
perish 
naturally, 
take 
away 
thus 
from 
us 
the 
demonstration 
which 
shows 
that 
our 
minds 
cannot 
perish 
naturally, 
and 
fall 
into 
the 
dogma 
of 
the 
Socinians, 
who 
think 
that 
souls 
are 
preserved 
only 
miraculously 
or 
by 
grace, 
but 
believe 
that 
by 
nature 
they 
ought 
to 
perish; 
which 
is 
to 
rob 
natural 
theology 
of 
its 
largest 
part. 
Besides, 
the 
contrary 
can 
be 
completely 
demonstrated, 
since 
a 
substance 
wanting 
parts 
cannot 
naturally 
bedestroyed.

THETHEODICY. 


ABRIDGMENTOFTHEARGUMENTREDUCEDTOSYLLOGISTIC 
FORM. 



1710. 


[FromtheFrench.] 


SOME 
intelligent 
persons 
have 
desired 
that 
this 
supplement 
should 
he 
made 
[to 
the 
Theodicy], 
and 
I 
have 
the 
more 
readily 
yielded 
to 
their 
wishes 
as 
in 
this 
way 
I 
have 
an 
opportunity 
to 
again 
remove 
certain 
difficulties 
and 
to 
make 
some 
observations 
which 
were 
not 
sufficiently 
emphasized 
in 
the 
work 
itself. 


I. 
Objection. 
Whoever 
does 
not 
choose 
the 
best 
is 
lacking 
in 
power, 
or 
in 
knowledge,orin 
goodness. 


Goddidnotchoose 
the 
bestincreatingthisworld. 


Therefore 
God 
has 
been 
lacking 
in 
power, 
or 
in 
knowledge, 
or 
in 
goodness. 


Answer. 
I 
deny 
the 
minor, 
that 
is, 
the 
second 
premise 
of 
this 
syllogism; 
and 
our 
opponent 
proves 
it 
by 
this 
Prosyllogism. 
Whoever 
makes 
things 
in 
which 
there 
is 
evil, 
which 
could 
have 
been 
made 
without 
any 
evil, 
or 
the

God 
has 
made 
a 
world 
in 
which 
there 
is 
evil; 
a 
world, 
I 
say, 
which 
could 
have 
been 
made 
without 
any 
evil, 
or 
the 
making 
of 
which 
could 
have 
been 
omittedaltogether. 


ThereforeGodhasnotchosenthebest. 



Answer. 
I 
grant 
the 
minor 
of 
this 
prosyllogism; 
for 
it 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
there 
is 
evil 
in 
the 
world 
which 
God 
has 
made, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
make 
a 
world 
without 
evil, 
or 
even 
not 
to 
create 
a 
world 
at 
all, 
for 
its 
creation 
depended 
on 
the 
free 
will 
of 
God; 
but 
I 
deny 
the 
major, 
that 
is, 
the 
first 
of 
the 
two 
premises 
of 
the 
prosyllogism, 
and 
I 
might 
content 
myself 
with 
simply 
demanding 
its 
proof; 
but 
in 
order 
to 
make 
the 
matter 
clearer, 
I 
have 
wished 
to 
justify 
this 
denial 
by 
showing 
that 
the 
best 
plan 
is 
not 
always 
that 
which 
seeks 
to 
avoid 
evil, 
since 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
the 
evil 
he 
accompanied 
by 
a 
greater 
good. 
For 
example, 
a 
general 
of 
an 
army 
will 
prefer 
a 
great 
victory 
with 
a 
slight 
wound 
to 
a 
condition 
without 
wound 
and 
without 
victory. 
We 
have 
proved 
this 
more 
fully 
in 
the 
large 
work 
by 
making 
it 
clear, 
by 
instances 
taken 
from 
mathematics 
and 
elsewhere, 
that 
an 
imperfection 
in 
the 
part 
may 
be 
required 
for 
a 
greater 
perfection 
in 
the 
whole. 
In 
this 
I 
have 
followed 
the 
opinion 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
who 
has 
said 
a 
hundred 
times, 
that 
God 
permitted 
evil 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
about 
good, 
that 
is, 
a 
greater 
good; 
and 
that 
of 
Thomas 
Aquinas 
(in 
libr. 
II. 
sent. 
dist. 
32, 
qu. 
I, 
art. 
1), 
that 
the 
permitting 
of 
evil 
tends 
to 
the 
good 
of 
the 
universe. 
I 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
ancients 
called 
Adam’s 
fall 
felix 
culpa, 
a 
happy 
sin, 
because 
it 
had 
been 
retrieved 
with 
immense 
advantage 
by 
the 
incarnation 
of 
the 
Son 
of 
God, 
who 
has 
given 
to 
the 
universe 
something 
nobler 
than 
anything 
that 
ever 
would 
have 
been 
among 
creatures 
except 
for 
this. 
And 
in 
order 
to 
a 
clearer 
understanding. 
I 
have 
added, 
following 
many 
good 
authors, 
that 
it 
was 
in 
accordance 
with 
order 
and 
the 
general 
good 
that 
God 
gave 
to 
certain 
creatures 
the 
opportunity 
of 
exercising 
their 
liberty, 
even 
when 
he 
foresaw 
that 
they 
would 
turn 
to 
evil, 
but 
which 
he 
could 
so 
well 
rectify; 
because 
it 
was 
not 
right 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
hindersin,Godshouldalwaysactinan 
extraordinarymanner. 


To 
overthrow 
this 
objection, 
therefore, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
show 
that 
a 
world 
with 
evil 
might 
be 
better 
than 
a 
world 
without 
evil; 
but 
I 
have 
gone 
even 



farther 
in 
the 
work, 
and 
have 
even 
proved 
that 
this 
universe 
must 
be 
in 
reality 
better 
thaneveryotherpossible 
universe. 


II. 
Objection.

there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
intelligent 
creatures, 
then

Answer. 
I 
deny 
the 
major 
and 
the 
minor 
of 
this 
conditional 
syllogism. 
As 
to 
the 
major, 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
it 
at 
all, 
because 
this 
pretended 
deduction 
from 
a 
part 
to 
the 
whole, 
from 
intelligent 
creatures 
to 
all 
creatures, 
supposes 
tacitly 
and 
without 
proof 
that 
creatures 
destitute 
of 
reason 
cannot 
enter 
into 
comparison 
nor 
into 
account 
with 
those 
which 
possess 
it. 
But 
why 
may 
it 
not 
be 
that 
the 
surplus 
of 
good 
in 
the 
non-intelligent 
creatures 
which 
fill 
the 
world, 
compensates 
for, 
and 
even 
incomparably 
surpasses, 
the 
surplus 
of 
evil 
in 
the 
rational 
creatures? 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
value 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
greater; 
but, 
in 
compensation, 
the 
other 
are 
beyond 
comparison 
the 
more 
numerous, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
that 
the 
proportion 
of 
number 
and 
of 
quantity 
surpasses 
that 
of 
value 
and 
ofquality. 


As 
to 
the 
minor, 
that 
is 
no 
more 
to 
be 
admitted; 
that 
is, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
to 
be 
admitted 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
the 
intelligent 
creatures. 
There 
is 
no 
need 
even 
of 
granting 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
the 
human 
race, 
because 
it 
is 
possible, 
and 
in 
fact 
very 
probable, 
that 
the 
glory 
and 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
blessed 
are 
incomparably 
greater 
than 
the 
misery 
and 
the 
imperfection 
of 
the 
damned, 
and 
that 
here 
the 
excellence 
of 
the 
total 
good 
in 
the 
smaller 
number 
exceeds 
the 
total 
evil 
in 
the 
greater 
number. 
The 
blessed 
approach 
the 
Divinity, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Divine 
Mediator, 
as 
near 
as 
may 
suit 
these 
creatures, 
and 
make 
such 
progress 
in 
good 
as 
is 
impossible 
for 
the 
damned 
to 
make 
in 
evil, 
approach 
as 
nearly 
as 
they 
may 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
demons. 
God 
is 
infinite, 
and 
the 
devil 
is 
limited; 
good 
may 
and 
does 
advance 



ad 
infinitum, 
while 
evil 
has 
its 
bounds. 
It 
is 
therefore 
possible, 
and 
is 
credible, 
that 
in 
the 
comparison 
of 
the 
blessed 
and 
the 
damned, 
the 
contrary 
of 
that 
which 
I 
have 
said 
might 
happen 
in 
the 
comparison 
of 
intelligent 
and 
non-intelligent 
creatures, 
takes 
place; 
namely, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
in 
the 
comparison 
of 
the 
happy 
and 
the 
unhappy, 
the 
proportion 
of 
degree 
exceeds 
that 
of 
number, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
comparison 
of 
intelligent 
and 
non-intelligent 
creatures, 
the 
proportion 
of 
number 
is 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
value. 
I 
have 
the 
right 
to 
suppose 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
possible 
so 
long 
as 
its 
impossibility 
is 
not 
proved; 
and 
Indeed 
that 
which 
I 
have 
here 
advanced 
is 
more 
than 
a 
supposition. 


But 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
if 
I 
should 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
the 
human 
race, 
I 
have 
still 
good 
grounds 
for 
not 
admitting 
that 
there 
is 
more 
evil 
than 
good 
in 
all 
intelligent 
creatures. 
For 
there 
is 
an 
inconceivable 
number 
of 
genii, 
and 
perhaps 
of 
other 
rational 
creatures. 
And 
an 
opponent 
could 
not 
prove 
that 
in 
all 
the 
City 
of 
God, 
composed 
as 
well 
of 
genii 
as 
of 
rational 
animals 
without 
number 
and 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
kinds, 
evil 
exceeds 
good. 
And 
although 
in 
order 
to 
answer 
an 
objection, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
of 
proving 
that 
a 
thing 
is, 
when 
its 
mere 
possibility 
suffices; 
yet, 
in 
this 
work, 
I 
have 
not 
omitted 
to 
show 
that 
it 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
supreme 
perfection 
of 
the 
Sovereign 
of 
the 
universe, 
that 
the 
kingdom 
of 
God 
be 
the 
most 
perfect 
of 
all 
possible 
states 
or 
governments, 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
little 
evil 
there 
is, 
is 
required 
for 
the 
consummation 
of 
the 
immense 
good 
which 
is 
therefound. 


III. 
Objection. 
If 
it 
is 
always 
impossible 
not 
to 
sin, 
it 
is 
always 
unjust 
to 
punish. 
How, 
it 
is 
always 
impossible 
not 
to 
sin; 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
every 
sin 
is 
necessary. 
Therefore,it 
isalwaysunjusttopunish. 



Theminorof

Prosyllogism. 
All 
that 
is

is 
necessary. 
Every

(and 
consequently 
sin 
also)isnecessary. 
Again 
thissecond

2. 
Prosyllogism.

that

inthecauses, 
ispredetermined. 


Every

Therefore,everyevent 
ispredetermined. 


Answer. 
I 
admit 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
second 


prosyllogism, 
which 
is 
the 
minor 
of 
the 
first; 
but 
I 
shall 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
the 
first 
prosyllogism, 
namely, 
that 
every 
thing 
predetermined 
is 
necessary; 
understanding 
by 
the 
necessity 
of 
sinning, 
for 
example, 
or 
by 
the 
impossibility 
of 
not 
sinning, 
or 
of 
not 
performing 
any 
action, 
the 
necessity 
with 
which 
we 
are 
here 
concerned, 
that 
is, 
that 
which 
is 
essential 
and 
absolute, 
and 
which 
destroys 
the 
morality 
of 
an 
action 
and 
the 
justice 
of 
punishments. 
For 
if 
anyone 
understood 
another 
necessity 
or 
impossibility, 
namely, 
a 
necessity 
which 
should 
be 
only 
moral, 
or 
which 
was 
only 
hypothetical 
(as 
will 
be 
explained 
shortly); 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
I 
should 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
the 
objection 
itself. 
I 
might 
content 
myself 
with 
this 
answer 
and 
demand 
the 
proof 
of 
the 
proposition 
denied; 
but 
I 
have 
again 
desired 
to 
explain 
my 
procedure 
in 
this 
work, 
in 
order 
to 
better 
elucidate 
the 
matter 
and 
to 
throw 
more 
light 
on 
the 
whole 
subject, 
by 
explaining 
the 
necessity 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
rejected 
and 
the 
determination 
which 
must 
take 
place. 
That 
necessity 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
morality 
and 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
rejected, 
and 
which 
would 
render 
punishment 
unjust, 
is 
an 
insurmountable 
necessity 
which 
would 
make 
all 
opposition 
useless, 
even 
if 
we 
should 
wish 
with 
all 
our 
heart 
toavoidthenecessaryaction,and 
shouldmakeallpossibleeffortsto 
thatend. 
Now, 
it 
is 
manifest 
that 
this 
is 
not 
applicable 
to 
voluntaryactions, 
becausewe 



would 
not 
perform 
them 
if 
we 
did 
not 
choose 
to. 
Also 
their 
prevision 
and 
predetermination 
is 
not 
absolute, 
but 
it 
supposes 
the 
will: 
if 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
we 
shall 
perform 
them, 
it 
is 
not 
less 
certain 
that 
we 
shall 
choose 
to 
perform 
them. 
These 
voluntary 
actions 
and 
their 
consequences 
will 
not 
take 
place 
no 
matter 
what 
we 
do 
or 
whether 
we 
wish 
them 
or 
not; 
but, 
through 
that 
which 
we 
shall 
do 
and 
through 
that 
which 
we 
shall 
wish 
to 
do, 
which 
leads 
to 
them. 
And 
this 
is 
involved 
in 
prevision 
and 
in 
predetermination, 
and 
even 
constitutes 
their 
ground. 
And 
the 
necessity 
of 
such 
an 
event 
is 
called 
conditional 
or 
hypothetical, 
or 
the 
necessity 
of 
consequence, 
because 
it 
supposes 
the 
will, 
and 
the 
other 
requisites; 
whereas 
the 
necessity 
which 
destroys 
morality 
and 
renders 
punishment 
unjust 
and 
reward 
useless, 
exists 
in 
things 
which 
will 
be 
whatever 
we 
may 
do 
or 
whatever 
we 
may 
wish 
to 
do, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
is 
in 
that 
which 
is 
essential; 
and 
this 
is 
what 
is 
called 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
Thus 
it 
is 
to 
no 
purpose, 
as 
regards 
what 
is 
absolutely 
necessary, 
to 
make 
prohibitions 
or 
commands, 
to 
propose 
penalties 
or 
prizes, 
to 
praise 
or 
to 
blame; 
it 
will 
be 
none 
the 
less. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
voluntary 
actions 
and 
in 
that 
which 
depends 
upon 
them, 
precepts 
armed 
with 
power 
to 
punish 
and 
to 
recompense 
are 
very 
often 
of 
use 
and 
are 
included 
in 
the 
order 
of 
causes 
which 
make 
an 
action 
exist. 
And 
it 
is 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
not 
only 
cares 
and 
labors 
but 
also 
prayers 
are 
useful; 
God 
having 
had 
these 
prayers 
in 
view 
before 
he 
regulated 
things 
and 
having 
had 
that 
consideration 
for 
them 
which 
wasproper. 
Thisis 
whythepreceptwhich 
says 
ora 
et 
labora 
(prayand 
work), 
holds 
altogether 
good; 
and 
not 
only 
those 
who 
(under 
the 
vain 
pretext 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
events) 
pretend 
that 
the 
care 
which 
business 
demands 
may 
be 
neglected, 
but 
also 
those 
who 
reason 
against 
prayer, 
fall 
into 
what 
the 
ancients 
even 
then 
called 
the 
lazy 
sophism. 
Thus 
the 
predetermination 
of 
events 
by 
causes 
is 
just 
what 
contributes 
to 
morality 
instead 
of 
destroying 
it, 
and 
causes 
incline 
the 
will, 
without 
compelling 
it. 
This 
is 
why 
the 



determination 
in 
question 
is 
not 
a 
necessitation 
— 
it 
is 
certain 
(to 
him 
who 
knows 
all) 
that 
the 
effect 
will 
follow 
this 
inclination; 
but 
this 
effect 
does 
not 
follow 
by 
a 
necessary 
consequence, 
that 
is, 
one 
the 
contrary 
of 
which 
implies 
contradiction. 
It 
is 
also 
by 
an 
internal 
inclination 
such 
as 
this 
that 
the 
will 
is 
determined, 
without 
there 
being 
any 
necessity. 
Suppose 
that 
one 
has 
the 
greatest 
passion 
in 
the 
world 
(a 
great 
thirst, 
for 
example), 
you 
will 
admit 
to 
me 
that 
the 
soul 
can 
find 
some 
reason 
for 
resisting 
it, 
if 
it 
were 
only 
that 
of 
showing 
its 
power. 
Thus, 
although 
one 
may 
never 
be 
in 
a 
perfect 
indifference 
of 
equilibrium 
and 
there 
may 
be 
always 
a 
preponderance 
of 
inclination 
for 
the 
side 
taken, 
it, 
nevertheless, 
never 
renders 
the 
resolution 
takenabsolutely 
necessary. 


IV. 
Objection. 
Whoever 
can 
prevent 
the 
sin 
of 
another 
and 
does 
not 
do 
so, 
but 
rather 
contributes 
to 
it 
although 
he 
is 
well 
informed 
of 
it, 
is 
accessory 
to 
it. 
God 
can 
prevent 
the 
sin 
of 
intelligent 
creatures; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
do 
so, 
and 
rather 
contributes 
to 
it 
by 
his 
concurrence 
and 
by 
the 
opportunities 
which 
he 
brings 
about,althoughhe 
hasaperfectknowledgeofit. 


Hence, 
etc. 


Answer. 
I 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
this 
syllogism. 
For 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
one 
could 
prevent 
sin, 
but 
ought 
not, 
because 
he 
could 
not 
do 
it 
without 
himself 
committing 
a 
sin, 
or 
(when 
God 
is 
in 
question) 
without 
performing 
an 
unreasonable 
action. 
Examples 
have 
been 
given 
and 
the 
application 
to 
God 
himself 
has 
been 
made. 
It 
is 
possible 
also 
that 
we 
contribute 
to 
evil 
and 
that 
sometimes 
we 
even 
open 
the 
road 
to 
it, 
in 
doing 
things 
which 
we 
are 
obliged 
todo;and,whenwedoourduty 
or(inspeaking 
ofGod)when,afterthorough 
consideration, 
we 
do 
that 
which 
reason 
demands, 
we 
are 
not 
responsible 
for 
the 
results, 
even 
when 
we 
foresee 
them. 
We 
do 
not 
desire 
these 
evils; 
but 
we 
are 
willing 
to 
permit 
them 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
a 
greater 
good 
which 
we 
cannot 



reasonably 
help 
preferring 
to 
other 
considerations, 
and 
it 
is 
a 
consequent 
will, 
which 
results 
from 
antecedent 
wills, 
by 
which 
we 
will 
the 
good. 
I 
know 
that 
some 
persons, 
in 
speaking 
of 
the 
antecedent 
and 
consequent 
will 
of 
God, 
have 
understood 
by 
the 
antecedent 
that 
which 
wills 
that 
all 
men 
should 
be 
saved; 
and 
by 
the 
consequent, 
that 
which 
wills, 
in 
consequence 
of 
persistent 
sin, 
that 
they 
should 
be 
damned. 
But 
these 
are 
merely 
illustrations 
of 
a 
more 
general 
idea, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
said 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
that 
God, 
by 
his 
antecedent 
will, 
wills 
that 
men 
should 
not 
sin; 
and 
by 
his 
consequent 
or 
final 
and 
decreeing 
will 
(that 
which 
is 
always 
followed 
by 
its 
effect), 
he 
wills 
to 
permit 
them 
to 
sin, 
this 
permission 
being 
the 
result 
of 
superior 
reasons. 
And 
we 
have 
the 
right 
to 
say 
in 
general 
that 
the 
antecedent 
will 
of 
God 
tends 
to 
the 
production 
of 
good 
and 
the 
prevention 
of 
evil, 
each 
taken 
in 
itself 
and 
as 
if 
alone(particulariter 
etsecundum 
quid, 
Thom. 
I, 
qu. 
19, 
art. 
6), 
accordingto 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
each 
good 
and 
of 
each 
evil; 
but 
that 
the 
divine 
consequent 
or 
final 
or 
total 
will 
tends 
toward 
the 
production 
of 
as 
many 
goods 
as 
may 
be 
put 
together, 
the 
combination 
of 
which 
becomes 
in 
this 
way 
determined, 
and 
includes 
also 
the 
permission 
of 
some 
evils 
and 
the 
exclusion 
of 
some 
goods, 
as 
the 
best 
possible 
plan 
for 
the 
universe 
demands. 
Arminius, 
in 
his 
Anti-perkinsus, 
has 
very 
well 
explained 
that 
the 
will 
of 
God 
may 
be 
called 
consequent, 
not 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
action 
of 
the 
creatures 
considered 
beforehand 
in 
the 
divine 
understanding, 
but 
also 
in 
relation 
to 
other 
anterior 
acts 
of 
will. 
But 
this 
consideration 
of 
the 
passage 
cited 
from 
Thomas 
Aquinas, 
and 
that 
from 
Scotus 
(I. 
dist. 
46, 
qu. 
XI), 
is 
enough 
to 
show 
that 
they 
make 
this 
distinction 
as 
I 
have 
done 
here. 
Nevertheless, 
if 
anyone 
objects 
to 
this 
use 
of 
terms 
let 
him 
substitute 
deliberating 
will, 
in 
place 
of 
antecedent, 
and 
final 
or 
decreeing 
will, 
in 
place 
of 
consequent. 
For 
I 
do 
not 
wishto

Answer. 
Imightcontentmyselfwithdenyingthemajorortheminor,since 
the 
term 
real 
admits 
of 
interpretations 
which 
would 
render 
these 
premises 
false. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
more 
clearly, 
I 
will 
make 
a 
distinction. 
Real 
signifies 
either 
that 
which 
is 
positive 
only, 
or, 
it 
includes 
also 
privative 
beings: 
in 
the 
first 
case, 
I 
deny 
the 
major 
and 
admit 
the 
minor; 
in 
the 
second 
case, 
I 
do 
the 
contrary. 
I 
might 
have 
limited 
myself 
to 
this, 
but 
I 
have 
chosen 
to 
proceed 
still 
farther 
and 
give 
the 
reason 
for 
this 
distinction. 
I 
have 
been 
very 
glad 
therefore 
to 
draw 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
every 
reality 
purely 
positive 
or 
absolute 
is 
a 
perfection; 
and 
that 
imperfection 
comes 
from 
limitation, 
that 
is, 
from 
the 
privative: 
for 
to 
limit 
is 
to 
refuse 
progress, 
or 
the 
greatest 
possible 
progress. 
Now 
God 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
perfections 
and 
consequently 
of 
all 
realities 
considered 
as 
purely 
positive. 
But 
limitations 
or 
privations 
result 
from 
the 
imperfection 
of 
creatures, 
limiting 
their 
receptivity. 
And 
it 
is 
with 
them 
as 
with 
a 
loaded 
vessel 
which 
the 
river 
causes 
to 
move 
more 
or 
less 
slowly 
according 
to 
the 
weight 
winch 
it 
carries: 
thus’ 
its 
speed 
depends 
upon 
the 
river, 
but 
the 
retardation 
which 
limits 
this 
speed 
comes 
from 
the 
load. 
Thus 
in 
the 
Theodicy, 
we 
have 
shown 
how 
the 
creature, 
in 
causing 
sin, 
is 
a 
defective 
cause; 
how 
errors 
and 
evil 
inclinations 
are 
born 
of 
privation; 
and 
how 
privation 
is 
accidentally 
efficient; 
and 
I 
have 
justified 
the 
opinion 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
(lib. 
I. 
ad 
Simpl. 
qu. 
2) 
who 
explains, 
for 
example, 
how 
God 
makes 
the 
soul 
obdurate, 
not 
by 
giving 
it 
something 
evil, 
but 
because 
the 
effect 
of 
his 
good 
impression 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
soul’s 
resistance 
and 
by 
the 
circumstances 
which 
contribute 
to 
this 
resistance, 
so 
that 
he 
does 
not 
give 
it 
all 
the 
good 
which 
would 
overcome 
its 
evil. 
Nec, 
inquuit, 
ab 
illo 
erogatur 
aliquid 
quo 
homo 
fit 
deterior, 
sed 
tantum 
quo 
fit 
melior 
non 
erogatur. 
But 
if 
God 
had 
wished 
to 
do 
more, 
he 
would 
have 
had 
to 
make 
either 
other 
natures 
for 
creatures, 
or 
other 
miracles 
to 
change 
their 
natures, 



things 
which 
the 
best 
plan 
could 
not 
admit. 
It 
is 
as 
if 
the 
current 
of 
the 
river 
must 
be 
more 
rapid 
than 
its 
fall 
admitted 
or 
that 
the 
boats 
should 
be 
loaded 
more 
lightly, 
if 
it 
were 
necessary 
to 
make 
them 
move 
more 
quickly. 
And 
the 
original 
limitation 
or 
imperfection 
of 
creatures 
requires 
that 
even 
the 
best 
plan 
of 
the 
universe 
could 
not 
be 
exempt 
from 
certain 
evils, 
but 
only 
those 
moreover, 
which 
are 
to 
result 
in 
a 
greater 
good. 
There 
are 
certain 
disorders 
in 
the 
parts 
which 
marvellously 
enhance 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
whole; 
just 
as 
certain 
dissonances, 
when 
properly 
used, 
render 
the 
harmony 
more 
beautiful. 
But 
this

VI. 
Objection. 
He 
who 
punishes 
those 
who 
have 
done 
as 
well 
as 
it 
was 
in 
theirpower 
todo, 
isunjust. 


Goddoesso. 


Hence, 
etc. 


Answer. 
I 
deny 
the 
minor 
of 
this 
argument 
and 
I 
believe 
that 
God 
always 


gives 
sufficient 
aid 
and 
grace 
to 
those 
who 
have 
a 
good 
will, 
that 
is, 
to 
those 
who 
do 
not 
reject 
this 
grace 
by 
new 
sin. 
Thus 
I 
do 
not 
admit 
the 
damnation 
of 
infants 
who 
have 
died 
without 
baptism 
or 
outside 
of 
the 
church; 
nor 
the 
damnation 
of 
adults 
who 
have 
acted 
according 
to 
the 
light 
which 
God 
has 
given 
them. 
And 
I 
believe 
that 
if 
any 
one 
has 
followed 
the 
bight 
which 
has 
been 
given 
him, 
he 
will 
undoubtedly 
receive 
greater 
light 
when 
he 
has 
need 
of 
it, 
as 
the 
late 
M. 
Hulseman, 
a 
profound 
and 
celebrated 
theologian 
at 
Leipsic, 
has 
somewhere 
remarked; 
and 
if 
such 
a 
man 
has 
failed 
to 
receive 
it 
during 
his 
lifetimehe 
willat

VII. 
Objection. 
He 
who 
gives 
only 
to 
some, 
and 
not 
to 
all, 
the 
means 
which 
produce 
in 
them 
effectively 
a 
good 
will 
and 
salutary 
final 
faith, 
has 
not 
sufficientgoodness. 
Goddoesthis. 
Hence, 
etc. 



Answer. 
I 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
this. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
God 
could 
overcome 
the 
greatest 
resistance 
of 
the 
human 
heart 
and 
does 
it, 
too, 
sometimes, 
he 
it 
by 
internal 
grace, 
be 
it 
by 
external 
circumstances 
which 
have 
a 
great 
effect 
on 
souls; 
but 
he 
does 
not 
always 
do 
this. 
Whence 
comes 
this 
distinction? 
it 
may 
be 
asked, 
and 
why 
does 
his 
goodness 
seem 
limited? 
It 
is 
because, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
said 
in 
answering 
the 
first 
objection, 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
in 
order 
always 
to 
act 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
manner, 
and 
to 
reverse 
the 
connection 
of 
things. 
The 
reasons 
of 
this 
connection, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
one 
is 
placed 
in 
more 
favorable 
circumstances 
than 
another, 
are 
hidden 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God; 
they 
depend 
upon 
the 
universal 
harmony. 
The 
best 
plan 
of 
the 
universe, 
which 
God 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
choose, 
made 
it 
so. 
We 
judge 
from 
the 
event 
itself, 
since 
God 
has 
made 
it, 
that 
it 
was 
not 
possible 
to 
do 
better. 
Far 
from 
being 
true 
that 
this 
conduct 
is 
contrary 
to 
goodness, 
it 
is 
supreme 
goodness 
which 
led 
him 
to 
it. 
This 
objection 
with 
its 
solution 
might 
have 
been 
drawn 
from 
what 
was 
said 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
first 
objection; 
but 
it 
seemed 
useful 
totouchuponitseparately. 


VIII. 
Objection. 
He

Godcannotfailtochoosethebest. 
Hence, 
Godis 
not 
free. 
Answer. 
I 
deny 
the 
major 
of 
this 
argument; 
it 
is 
rather 
true 
liberty 
and 
the 
most 
perfect, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
use 
one’s 
free 
will 
for 
the 
best, 
and 
to 
always 
exercise 
this 
power 
without 
ever 
being 
turned 
from 
it 
either 
by 
external 
force 
or 
by 
internal 
passions, 
the 
first 
of 
which 
causes 
slavery 
of 
the 
body, 
the 
second, 
slavery 
of 
the 
soul. 
There 
is 
nothing 
less 
servile 
than 
to 
be 
always 
led 
toward 
the 
good, 
and 
always 
by 
one’s 
own 
inclination, 
without 
any 
constraint 
and 
without 
any 
displeasure. 
And 
to 
object 
therefore 
that 
God 
had 
need 
of 
external 
things, 
is 
only 
a 
sophism. 
He 
created 
them 
freely; 
but 
having 
proposed 
to 
himself 
an 
end, 
which 
is 
to 
exercise 
his 
goodness, 
wisdom 



determined 
him 
to 
choose 
those 
means 
best 
fitted 
to 
attain 
this 
end. 
To 
call 
this 
a 
need 
is 
to 
take 
that 
term 
in 
an 
unusual 
sense 
which 
frees 
it 
from 
all 
imperfection,justaswhenwespeak 
ofthewrath 
ofGod. 


Seneca 
has 
somewhere 
said 
that 
God 
commanded 
but 
once 
but 
that 
he 
obeys 
always, 
because 
he 
obeys 
laws 
which 
he 
willed 
to 
prescribe 
to 
himself; 
semel 
jussit, 
semper 
paret. 
But 
he 
had 
better 
have 
said 
that 
God 
always 
commands 
and 
that 
he 
is 
always 
obeyed; 
for 
in 
willing, 
he 
always 
follows 
the 
inclination 
of 
his 
own 
nature, 
and 
all 
other 
things 
always 
follow 
his 
will. 
And 
as 
this 
will 
is 
always 
the 
same, 
it 
cannot 
be 
said 
that 
he 
obeys 
only 
that 
will 
which 
he 
formerly 
had. 
Nevertheless, 
although 
his 
will 
is 
always 
infallible 
and 
always 
tends 
toward 
the 
best, 
the 
evil, 
or 
the 
lesser 
good, 
which 
he 
rejects, 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
be 
possible 
in 
itself; 
otherwise 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
good 
would 
be 
geometrical 
(so 
to 
speak), 
or 
metaphysical 
and 
altogether 
absolute; 
the 
contingency 
of 
things 
would 
be 
destroyed, 
and 
there 
would 
be 
no 
choice. 
But 
this 
sort 
of 
necessity, 
which 
does 
not 
destroy 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
contrary, 
has 
this 
name 
only 
by 
analogy; 
it 
becomes 
effective, 
not 
by 
the 
pure 
essence 
of 
things, 
but 
by 
that 
which 
is 
outside 
of 
them, 
above 
them, 
— 
namely, 
by 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
This 
necessity 
is 
called 
moral, 
because, 
to 
the 
sage, 
necessity 
and 
what 
ought 
to 
be 
are 
equivalent 
things; 
and 
when 
it 
always 
has 
its 
effect, 
as 
it 
really 
has 
inthe 
perfect 
sage, 
thatis, 
in 
God, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
a 
happy 
necessity. 
The 
nearer 
creatures 
approach 
to 
it, 
the 
nearer 
they 
approach 
to 
perfect 
happiness. 
Also 
this 
kind 
of 
necessity 
is 
not 
that 
which 
we 
try 
to 
avoid 
and 
which 
destroys 
morality, 
rewards 
and 
praise. 
For 
that 
which 
it 
brings, 
does 
not 
happen 
whatever 
we 
may 
do 
or 
will, 
but 
because 
we 
will 
it 
well. 
And 
a 
will 
to 
which 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
choose 
well, 
merits 
praise 
so 
much 
the 
more; 
also 
it 
carries 
its 
reward 
with 
it, 
which 
is 
sovereign 
happiness. 
And 
as 
this 
constitution 
of 
the 
divine 
nature 
gives 
entire 
satisfaction 
to 
him 
who 
possesses 
it, 
it 
is 
also 
the 
best 
and 
the 
most 
desirable 



for 
the 
creatures 
who 
are 
all 
dependent 
on 
God. 
If 
the 
will 
of 
God 
did 
not 
have 
for 
a 
rule 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
best, 
it 
would 
either 
tend 
toward 
evil, 
which 
wouldbetheworst;oritwould 
beinsomeway 
indifferentto 
goodand 
to 
evil, 
and 
would 
be 
guided 
by 
chance: 
but 
a 
will 
which 
would 
allow 
itself 
always 
to 
act 
by 
chance, 
would 
not 
be 
worth 
more 
for 
the 
government 
of 
the 
universe 
than 
the 
fortuitous 
concourse 
of 
atoms, 
without 
there 
being 
any 
divinity 
therein. 
And 
even 
if 
God 
should 
abandon 
himself 
to 
chance 
only 
in 
some 
cases 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
(as 
he 
would 
do, 
if 
he 
did 
not 
always 
work 
towards 
the 
best 
and 
if 
he 
were 
capable 
of 
preferring 
a 
lesser 
good 
to 
a 
greater, 
that 
is, 
an 
evil 
to 
a 
good, 
since 
that 
which 
prevents 
a 
greater 
good 
is 
an 
evil), 
he 
would 
be 
imperfect, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
object 
of 
his 
choice; 
he 
would 
not 
merit 
entire 
confidence; 
he 
would 
act 
without 
reason 
in 
such 
a 
case, 
and 
the 
government 
of 
the 
universe 
would 
be 
like 
certain 
games, 
equally 
divided 
between 
reason 
and 
chance. 
All 
this 
proves 
that 
this 
objection 
which 
is 
made 
against 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
best, 
perverts 
the 
notions 
of 
the 
free 
and 
of 
the 
necessary, 
and 
represents 
to 
us 
even 
the 
best 
as 
evil; 
to 
do 
which 
is 
either 
maliciousorridiculous.

[FromtheFrench.] 



WISDOM 
IS 
Aperfectknowledge 
ofthe 
principles 
of 
allthe 
sciences 
and 
of 
the 
art 
of 
applying 
them. 
I 
call 
principles 
all 
the 
fundamental 
truths 
which 
sufficefordrawingthenceallconclusions 
incaseof 
need,aftersomeexercise 
and 
with 
some 
little 
application. 
In 
a 
word, 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
lead 
the 
mind 
to 
regulate 
the 
manners, 
to 
subsist 
honestly, 
and 
everywhere, 
even 
if 
one 
were 
amid 
barbarians, 
to 
preserve 
the 
health, 
to 
perfect 
one’s 
self 
in 
every 
kind 
of 
thing 
of 
which 
one 
may 
have 
need, 
and 
to 
provide, 
finally, 
the 
conveniences 
of 
life. 
The 
art 
of 
applying 
these 
principles 
to 
exigencies, 
embraces 
the 
artofjudging 
well 
or 
reasoning,the 
artof 
discovering 
unknown 
truths, 
and 
finally, 
of 
remembering 
what 
one 
knows, 
in 
the 
nick 
of 
time 
and 
whenone 
has 
need 
ofit. 


THEARTOFREASONINGWELLconsistsinthefollowingmaxims: 


1. 
Nothing 
is 
ever 
to 
be 
recognized 
as 
true 
but 
what 
is 
so 
manifest 
that 
no 
ground 
for 
doubt 
can 
he 
found. 
This 
is 
why 
it 
will 
be 
well, 
in 
beginning 
one’s 
investigations, 
to 
imagine 
one’s 
self 
interested 
in 
sustaining 
the 
contrary, 
in 
order 
to 
see 
if 
this 
incitement 
could 
not 
arouse 
one 
to 
find 
that 
the 
matter 
has 
something 
solid 
to 
be 
said 
in 
its 
favor. 
For 
prejudices 
must 
be 
avoided 
and 
nothing 
he 
ascribed 
to 
things 
but 
what 
they 
include. 
But 
also 
one 
must 
never 
beopinionated. 
2. 
When 
there 
appears 
tobenomeansofattaining 
thisassurance, 
we 
must, 
in 
waiting 
for 
greater 
fight, 
content 
ourselves 
with 
probability. 
But 
we 
must 
distinguish 
the 
degrees 
of 
probability 
and 
we 
must 
remember 
that 
all 
that 
we 

infer 
from 
a 
principle 
which 
is 
but 
probable 
must 
hear 
the 
marks 
of 
the 
imperfection 
of 
its 
source, 
especially 
when 
several 
probabilities 
must 
he 
supposed 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
this 
conclusion, 
for 
it 
thereby 
becomes 
still 
less 
certainthanwaseachprobability 
whichservesitasbasis. 


3. 
To 
infer 
one 
truth 
from 
another, 
a 
certain 
connection, 
which 
shall 
be 
without 
interruption, 
must 
he 
observed. 
For 
as 
one 
may 
feel 
sure 
that 
a 
chain 
will 
hold 
when 
he 
is 
assured 
that 
each 
separate 
link 
is 
of 
good 
material 
and 
that 
it 
clasps 
the 
two 
neighboring 
links, 
viz: 
the 
one 
preceding 
and 
the 
one 
following 
it, 
so 
we 
may 
he 
sure 
of 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
reasoning 
when 
the 
matter 
is 
good, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
nothing 
doubtful 
enters 
into 
it, 
and 
when 
the 
form 
consists 
in 
a 
perpetual 
concatenation 
of 
truths 
which 
allows 
of 
no 
gap. 
For 
example, 
A 
is 
B 
and 
B 
is 
C 
and 
C 
is 
D, 
hence 
A 
is 
D. 
This 
concatenation 
will 
always 
teach 
us 
never 
to 
put 
in 
the 
conclusion 
more 
than 
therewas 
inthepremises. 
THEARTOFDISCOVERYconsistsinthefollowingmaxims: 


1. 
In 
order 
to 
know 
a 
thing 
we 
must 
consider 
all 
the 
requisites 
of 
that 
thing, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
all 
that 
which 
suffices 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
every 
other 
thing. 
This 
iswhatiscalleddefinition, 
nature,reciprocalproperty. 
2. 
Having 
once 
found 
a 
means 
of 
distinguishing 
it 
from 
every 
other 
thing, 
this 
same 
first 
rule 
must 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
each 
condition 
or 
requisite 
which 
enters 
into 
this 
means, 
and 
all 
the 
requisites 
of 
each 
requisite 
must 
be 
considered. 
And 
this 
is 
what 
I 
call 
true 
analysis 
or 
distribution 
of 
the 
difficultyinto 
severalparts. 
3. 
When 
we 
have 
pushed 
the 
analysis 
to 
the 
end, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
when 
we 
have 
considered 
the 
requisites 
which 
enter 
into 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
thing 
proposed 
and 
even 
the 
requisites 
of 
the 
requisites, 
and 
when 
we 
have 
finally 
cometothe 
consideration 
of 
somenatures 
which 
are 
understood 
only 
through 
themselves, 
which 
are 
without 
requisites 
and 
which 
need 
nothing 
outside 
of 

themselves 
in 
order 
to 
be 
conceived, 
we 
have 
reached 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
thethingproposed. 


4. 
When 
the 
thing 
deserves 
it, 
we 
must 
try 
to 
have 
this 
perfect 
knowledge 
present 
in 
the 
mind 
all 
at 
once, 
and 
this 
is 
done 
by 
repeating 
the 
analysis 
several 
times 
until 
it 
seems 
to 
us 
that 
we 
see 
the 
whole 
of 
it 
at 
a 
single 
glance 
of 
the 
mind. 
And 
for 
this 
result 
a 
certain 
gradation 
in 
repetition 
must 
be 
observed. 
5. 
The 
mark 
of 
perfect 
knowledge 
is 
when 
nothing 
presents 
itself 
in 
the 
thing 
in 
question 
for 
which 
we 
cannot 
account 
and 
when 
there 
is 
no 
conjuncture 
the 
outcome 
of 
which 
we 
cannot 
predict 
beforehand. 
It 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
carry 
through 
an 
analysis 
of 
things, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
so 
difficult 
to 
complete 
the 
analysis 
of 
truths 
of 
which 
we 
have 
need. 
Because 
the 
analysis 
of 
a 
truth 
is 
completed 
when 
its 
demonstration 
has 
been 
found, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
always 
necessary 
to 
complete 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
subject 
or 
predicate 
in 
order 
to 
find 
the 
demonstration 
of 
a 
proposition. 
Most 
often 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
analysis 
of 
a 
thing 
suffices 
for 
the 
analysis 
or 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth 
which 
we 
know 
ofthething. 
6. 
We 
must 
always 
begin 
our 
investigations 
with 
the 
easiest 
thing, 
such 
as 
the 
most 
general 
and 
the 
simplest, 
likewise 
those 
on 
which 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
make 
experimentsand 
tofind 
their 
reason,such 
asnumbers,lines,motions. 
7. 
We 
must 
proceed 
in 
order, 
and 
from 
easy 
things 
to 
those 
which 
are 
difficult, 
and 
we 
must 
try 
to 
discover 
some 
progression 
in 
the 
order 
of 
our 
meditations,sothatwemay 
havenatureitselfas 
ourguideandvoucher. 
8. 
We 
must 
try 
to 
omit 
nothing 
in 
all 
our 
distributions 
or 
enumerations. 
Forthis,dichotomies 
byopposite 
membersareveryuseful. 
9. 
The 
first 
of 
several 
analyses 
of 
different 
particular 
matters 
will 
be 
the 
catalogue 
of 
simple 
thoughts, 
or 
those 
which 
are 
not 
far 
removed 
from 
simple. 

10. 
Having 
the 
catalogue 
of 
simple 
thoughts 
we 
shall 
be 
in 
position 
to 
recommence 
a 
priori 
and 
to 
explain 
the 
origin 
of 
things, 
beginning 
at 
their 
source, 
in 
a 
perfect 
order 
and 
in 
a 
combination 
or 
synthesis 
absolutely 
complete. 
And 
this 
is 
all 
that 
our 
mind 
can 
do 
in 
the 
state 
in 
which 
it 
is 
at 
present. 
THE 
ART 
OF 
REMEMBERING 
in 
the 
nick 
of 
time 
and 
when 
it 
is 
needed 
whatoneknows, 
consists 
inthefollowingobservations: 


1. 
We 
must 
accustom 
ourselves 
to 
be 
present-minded, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
meditate 
just 
as 
well 
in 
a 
tumult, 
on 
occasion, 
and 
in 
danger, 
as 
in 
our 
cabinet. 
This 
is 
why 
we 
must 
test 
ourselves 
on 
occasions 
and 
even 
seek 
them; 
with 
this 
precaution, 
however, 
that 
we 
do 
not 
expose 
ourselves 
without 
good 
reason 
to 
irreparable 
evil. 
In 
the 
meanwhile 
it 
is 
good 
to 
exercise 
ourselves 
on 
occasions 
when 
the 
danger 
is 
imaginary 
or 
small, 
as 
in 
our 
sport, 
conversations, 
conferences,exercises,andcomedies. 
2. 
We 
must 
accustom 
ourselves 
to 
enumerations. 
This 
is 
why 
it 
is 
well 
to 
exercise 
ourselves 
incollectingallpossiblecasesofthematterin 
question, 
all 
the 
species 
of 
a 
genus, 
all 
the 
conveniences 
or 
inconveniences 
of 
a 
means, 
all 
possiblewaysofaimingatsomeend. 
3. 
We 
must 
accustom 
ourselves 
to 
distinctions; 
namely, 
two 
or 
more 
very 
similarthingsbeing 
given,tofindonthespotall 
their 
differences. 
4. 
We 
must 
accustom 
ourselves 
to 
analogies; 
namely, 
two 
or 
more 
very 
differentthingsbeinggiventofindtheirresemblances. 
5. 
We 
must 
be 
able 
to 
adduce 
on 
the 
spot 
things 
which 
closely 
resemble 
the 
given 
thing 
or 
which 
are 
very 
different 
from 
it. 
For 
example, 
when 
one 
denies 
some 
general 
maxim, 
it 
is 
well 
if 
I 
can 
adduce 
on 
the 
spot 
some 
examples. 
And 
when 
another 
quotes 
some 
maxim 
against 
me, 
it 
is 
well 
if 
I 
can 
forthwith 
oppose 
an 
instance 
to 
him. 
When 
one 
tells 
me 
a 
story, 
it 
is 
well 
if 
Icanadducethen 
andthereasimilarone. 

6. 
When 
there 
are 
truths 
or 
knowledges 
in 
which 
the 
natural 
connection 
of 
the 
subject 
with 
its 
predicate 
is 
not 
known 
to 
us, 
as 
happens 
in 
matters 
of 
fact 
and 
in 
truths 
of 
experience, 
in 
order 
to 
retain 
them 
we 
must 
make 
use 
of 
certain 
artifices, 
as 
for 
example, 
for 
the 
specific 
properties 
of 
simple, 
natural, 
civil 
and 
ecclesiastical 
history, 
geography, 
customs, 
laws, 
canons, 
languages. 
I 
see 
nothing 
so 
fitted 
to 
make 
us 
retain 
these 
things 
as 
burlesque 
verses 
and 
sometimes 
certain 
figures; 
also 
hypotheses 
invented 
to 
explain 
them 
in 
imitation 
of 
natural 
things 
(as 
an 
appropriate 
etymology, 
true 
or 
false, 
for 
languages 
— 
Régula 
mundi, 
in 
imagining 
certain 
orders 
of 
providence 
for 
history). 
7. 
Finally, 
it 
is 
well 
to 
make 
an 
inventory 
in 
writing 
of 
the 
knowledges 
which 
are 
the 
most 
useful, 
with 
a 
register 
or 
alphabetical 
table. 
And 
finally 
a 
portable 
manual 
must 
be 
drawn 
therefrom 
of 
what 
is 
most 
necessary 
and 
mostordinary. 

THE 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
NATURE 
AND 
OF 
GRACE. 
1714. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



1. 
SUBSTANCE 
IS 
being, 
capable 
of 
action. 
It 
is 
simple 
or 
compound. 
Simple 
substance 
is 
that 
which 
has 
no 
parts. 
Compound 
substance 
is 
a 
collection 
of 
simple 
substances 
or 
monads. 
Monas 
is 
a 
Greek 
word 
which 
signifies 
unity, 
orthatwhich 
isone. 
Compounds, 
or 
bodies, 
are 
multitudes; 
and 
simple 
substances, 
lives, 
souls, 
spirits 
are 
unities. 
And 
there 
must 
be 
simple 
substances 
everywhere, 
because 
without 
simple 
substances 
there 
would 
be 
no 
compounds; 
and 
consequently 
allnature 
isfulloflife. 


2. 
Monads, 
having 
no 
parts, 
cannot 
be 
formed 
or 
decomposed. 
They 
cannot 
begin 
or 
end 
naturally; 
and 
consequently 
last 
as 
long 
as 
the 
universe, 
which 
will 
indeed 
be 
changed 
but 
will 
not 
be 
destroyed. 
They 
cannot 
have 
shapes; 
otherwise 
they 
would 
have 
parts. 
And 
consequently 
a 
monad, 
in 
itself 
and 
at 
a 
given 
moment, 
could 
not 
be 
distinguished 
from 
another 
except 
by 
its 
internal 
qualities 
and 
actions, 
which 
can 
be 
nothing 
else 
than 
its 
perceptions 
(that 
is, 
representations 
of 
the 
compound, 
or 
of 
what 
is 
external, 
in 
the 
simple), 
and 
its 
appetitions 
(that 
is, 
its 
tendencies 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another), 
which 
are 
the 
principles 
of 
change. 
For 
the 
simplicity 
of 
substance 
does 
not 
prevent 
multiplicity 
of 
modifications, 
which 
must 
be 
found 
together 
in 
this 
same 
simple 
substance, 
and 
must 
consist 
in 
the 
variety 
of 
relations 
to 
things 
which 
are 
external. 
Just 
as 
in 
a 
centre 
or 
point, 
altogether 
simple 
as 
it 
is,thereisfoundaninfinityofanglesformedby 
lineswhichtheremeet. 
3. 
Everything 
in 
nature 
is 
full. 
There 
are 
everywhere 
simple 
substances, 
separated 
in 
reality 
from 
each 
other 
by 
activities 
of 
their 
own 
which 

continually 
change 
their 
relations; 
and 
each 
simple 
substance, 
or 
monad, 
which 
forms 
the 
centre 
of 
a 
compound 
substance 
(as, 
for 
example, 
of 
an 
animal) 
and 
the 
principle 
of 
its 
unity, 
is 
surrounded 
by 
a 
mass 
composed 
of 
an 
infinity 
of 
other 
monads, 
which 
constitute 
the 
body 
proper 
of 
this 
central 
monad; 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
affections 
of 
this 
it 
represents, 
as 
a 
centre, 
the 
things 
which 
are 
outside 
of 
itself. 
And 
this 
body 
is 
organic, 
when 
it 
forms 
a 
sort 
of 
automaton 
or 
natural 
machine: 
which 
is 
a 
machine 
not 
only 
in 
its 
entirety, 
but 
also 
in 
its 
smallest 
perceptible 
parts. 
And 
as, 
because 
of 
the 
plenitude 
of 
the 
world, 
everything 
is 
connected 
and 
each 
body 
acts 
upon 
every 
other 
body, 
more 
or 
less 
according 
to 
the 
distance, 
and 
by 
reaction 
is 
itself 
affected 
thereby; 
it 
follows 
that 
each 
monad 
is 
a 
mirror, 
living 
or 
endowed 
with 
internal 
activity, 
representative 
according 
to 
its 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
as 
regulated 
as 
the 
universe 
itself. 
And 
perceptions 
in 
the 
monad 
spring 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
by 
the 
law 
of 
appetites 
or 
by 
the 
final 
causes 
of 
good 
and 
evil, 
which 
consist 
in 
visible, 
regulated 
or 
unregulated 
perceptions; 
just 
as 
the 
changes 
of 
bodies 
and 
external 
phenomena 
spring 
one 
from 
another, 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
efficient 
causes, 
that 
is, 
of 
movements. 
Thus 
there 
is 
perfect 
harmony 
between 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
monad 
and 
the 
movements 
of 
bodies, 
established 
at 
the 
beginning 
between 
the 
system 
of 
efficient 
causes 
and 
that 
of 
final 
causes. 
And 
in 
this 
consists 
the 
accord 
and 
physical 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
body, 
although 
neither 
one

4. 
Each 
monad, 
with 
a 
particular 
body, 
makes 
a 
living 
substance. 
Thus 
there 
is 
not 
only 
life 
everywhere, 
provided 
with 
members 
or 
organs, 
but 
also 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
degrees 
in 
monads, 
some 
dominating 
more 
or 
less 
over 
the 
others. 
But 
when 
the 
monad 
has 
organs 
so 
adjusted 
that 
by 
means 
of 
them 
there 
is 
clearness 
and 
distinctness 
in 
the 
impressions 
which 
it 
receives 
and 
consequently 
in 
the 
perceptions 
which 
represent 
them 
(as, 
for 
example, 
when 

by 
means 
of 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
humors 
of 
the 
eyes, 
the 
rays 
of 
light 
are 
concentrated 
and 
act 
with 
more 
force); 
this 
can 
extend 
even 
to 
feeling 
[sentiment], 
that 
is, 
even 
to 
a 
perception 
accompanied 
by 
memory, 
that 
is, 
one 
a 
certain 
echo 
of 
which 
remains 
a 
long 
time 
to 
make 
itself 
heard 
upon 
occasion; 
and 
such 
a 
living 
being 
is 
called 
an 
animal, 
as 
its 
monad 
is 
called 
a 
soul. 
And 
when 
this 
soul 
is 
elevated 
to 
reason 
it 
is 
something 
more 
sublime 
and 
isreckoned 
amongspirits,aswill 
soonbeexplained. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
animals 
are 
sometimes 
in 
the 
condition 
of 
simple 
living 
beings, 
and 
their 
souls 
in 
the 
condition 
of 
simple 
monads, 
namely, 
when 
their 
perceptions 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
distinct 
to 
be 
remembered, 
as 
happens 
in 
a 
profound, 
dreamless 
sleep, 
or 
in 
a 
swoon. 
But 
perceptions 
which 
have 
becomeentirely 
confused 
must 
be 
re-developed 
in 
animals,for 
reasons 
which 
I 
shall 
shortly 
(§ 
12) 
enumerate. 
Therefore 
it 
is 
well 
to 
make 
a 
distinction 
between 
the 
perception, 
which 
is 
the 
internal 
condition 
of 
the 
monad 
representing 
external 
things, 
and 
apperception, 
which 
is 
consciousness 
or 
the 
reflective 
knowledge 
of 
this 
internal 
state; 
the 
latter 
not 
being 
given 
to 
all 
souls, 
nor 
at 
all 
times 
to 
the 
same 
soul. 
And 
it 
is 
for 
want 
of 
this 
distinction 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
failed, 
taking 
no 
account 
of 
the 
perceptions 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
as 
people 
take 
no 
account 
of 
imperceptible 
bodies. 
It 
is 
this 
also 
which 
made 
the 
same 
Cartesians 
believe 
that 
only 
spirits 
are 
monads,thatthereisno 
soulofbrutes,andstill 
lessother 
principles 
of 
life. 


And 
as 
they 
shocked 
too 
much 
the 
common 
opinion 
of 
men 
by 
refusing 
feeling 
to 
brutes, 
they 
have, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
accommodated 
themselves 
too 
much 
to 
the 
prejudices 
of 
the 
multitude, 
by 
confounding 
a 
long 
swoon, 
caused 
by 
a 
great 
confusion 
of 
perceptions, 
with 
death 
strictly 
speaking, 
where 
all 
perception 
would 
cease. 
Thisconfirmed 
the 
ill-founded 
beliefinthe 
destruction 
of 
some 
souls, 
and 
the 
bad 
opinion 
of 
some 
so-called 
strong 
minds,whohave 
contendedagainst 
the 
immortality 
ofour 
soul. 



5. 
There 
is 
a 
continuity 
in 
the 
perceptions 
of 
animals 
which 
bears 
some 
resemblance 
to 
reason; 
but 
it 
is 
only 
founded 
in 
the 
memory 
of 
facts, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
causes. 
Thus 
a 
dog 
shuns 
the 
stick 
with 
which 
it 
has 
been 
beaten, 
because 
memory 
represents 
to 
it 
the 
pain 
which 
the 
stick 
has 
caused 
it. 
And 
men 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
empirics, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
three-
fourths 
of 
their 
actions, 
act 
simply 
as 
brutes. 
For 
example, 
we 
expect 
that 
there 
will 
be 
daylight 
to-morrow, 
because 
we 
have 
always 
had 
the 
experience; 
only 
an 
astronomer 
foresees 
it 
by 
reason, 
and 
even 
this 
prediction 
will 
finally 
fail 
when 
the 
cause 
of 
day, 
which 
is 
not 
eternal, 
shall 
cease. 
But 
true 
reasoning 
depends 
upon 
necessary 
or 
eternal 
truths, 
such 
as 
those 
of 
logic, 
numbers, 
geometry, 
which 
establish 
an 
indubitable 
connection 
of 
ideas 
and 
unfailing 
consequences. 
The 
animals 
in 
which 
these 
consequences 
are 
not 
noticed, 
are 
called 
brutes; 
but 
those 
which 
know 
these 
necessary 
truths 
are 
properly 
those 
which 
are 
called 
rational 
animals, 
and 
their 
souls 
are 
called 
spirits. 
These 
souls 
are 
capable 
of 
performing 
acts 
of 
reflection, 
and 
of 
considering 
that 
which 
is 
called 
the 
ego, 
substance, 
monad, 
soul, 
spirit, 
in 
a 
word, 
immaterial 
things 
and 
truths. 
It 
is 
this 
which 
renders 
us 
capable 
of 
the 
sciences 
andof 
demonstrative 
knowledge. 
6. 
Modem 
researches 
have 
taught 
us, 
and 
reason 
approves 
of 
it, 
that 
living 
beings 
whose 
organs 
are 
known 
to 
us, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
plants 
and 
animals, 
do 
not 
come 
from 
putrefaction 
or 
from 
chaos, 
as 
the 
ancients 
believed, 
but 
from 
pre-formed 
seeds, 
and 
consequently 
by 
the 
transformation 
of 
pre-existing 
living 
beings. 
There 
are 
animalcules 
in 
the 
seeds 
of 
large 
animals, 
which 
by 
means 
of 
conception 
assume 
a 
new 
dress 
which 
they 
make 
their 
own 
and 
by 
means 
of 
which 
they 
can 
nourish 
themselves 
and 
increase 
their 
size, 
in 
order 
to 
pass 
to 
a 
larger 
theatre 
and 
to 
accomplish 
the 
propagation 
of 
the 
large 
animal. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
souls 
of 
spermatic 
human 
animals 
are 
not 
rational 
and 
do 
not 
become 
so 
until 
conception 
determines 
these 
animals 
to 
the 

human 
nature. 
And 
as 
generally 
animals 
are 
not 
born 
altogether 
in 
conception 
or 
generation, 
neither 
dotheyperish 
altogether 
in 
what 
wecall 
death; 
foritis 
reasonable 
that 
what 
does 
not 
begin 
naturally, 
should 
not 
end 
either 
in 
the 
order 
of 
nature. 
Therefore, 
quitting 
their 
mask 
or 
their 
rags, 
they 
merely 
return 
to 
a 
more 
subtile 
theatre 
where 
they 
can, 
nevertheless, 
be 
just 
as 
sensitive 
and 
just 
as 
well 
regulated 
as 
in 
the 
larger. 
And 
what 
we 
have 
just 
said 
of 
large 
animals, 
takes 
place 
also 
in 
the 
generation 
and 
death 
of 
smaller 
spermatic 
animals, 
in 
comparison 
with 
which 
the 
former 
may 
pass 
for 
large; 
foreverything 
extends 
ad 
infinitum 
in 
nature. 


Thus 
not 
only 
souls, 
but 
also 
animals, 
are 
ingenerable 
and 
imperishable: 
they 
are 
only 
developed, 
unfolded, 
reclothed, 
unclothed, 
transformed: 
souls 
never 
quit 
their 
entire 
body 
and 
do 
not 
pass 
from 
one 
body 
into 
another 
which 
isentirelynewtothem. 


There 
is 
therefore 
no 
metempsychosis, 
but 
there 
is 
metamorphosis; 
animals 
change, 
take 
and 
leave 
only 
parts: 
the 
same 
thing 
which 
happens 
little 
by 
little 
and 
by 
small 
invisible 
particles 
but 
continually 
in 
nutrition, 
and 
suddenly, 
visibly 
but 
rarely 
in 
conception 
or 
death, 
which 
cause 
a 
gain 
or 
loss 
ofeverythingatonetime. 


7. 
Up 
to 
this 
time 
we 
have 
spoken 
as 
simple 
physicists: 
now 
we 
must 
advance 
to 
metaphysics 
by 
making 
use 
of 
the 
great 
principle, 
little 
employed 
in 
general, 
which 
teaches 
that 
nothing 
happens 
without 
a 
sufficient 
reason; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
nothing 
happens 
without 
its 
being 
possible 
for 
him 
who 
should 
sufficiently 
understand 
things, 
to 
give 
a 
reason 
sufficient 
to 
determine 
why 
it 
is 
so 
and 
not 
otherwise. 
This 
principle 
laid 
down, 
the 
first 
question 
which 
should 
rightly 
be 
asked, 
would 
be, 
Why 
is 
there 
something 
rather 
than 
nothing? 
For 
nothing 
is 
simpler 
and 
easier 
than 
something. 
Further, 
suppose 
that 
thingsmustexist,wemustbeable 
togiveareason 
why 
they 
must 
exist 
so 
and 
not 
otherwise. 

8. 
Now 
this 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
universe 
could 
not 
be 
found 
in 
the 
series 
of 
contingent 
things, 
that 
is, 
of 
bodies 
and 
of 
their 
representations 
in 
souls; 
for 
matter 
being 
indifferent 
in 
itself 
to 
motion 
and 
to 
rest 
and 
to 
this 
or 
another 
motion, 
we 
could 
not 
find 
the 
reason 
of 
motion 
in 
it, 
and 
still 
less 
of 
a 
certain 
motion. 
And 
although 
the 
present 
motion 
which 
is 
in 
matter, 
comes 
from 
the 
preceding 
motion, 
and 
that 
from 
still 
another 
preceding, 
yet 
in 
this 
way 
we 
should 
never 
make 
any 
progress, 
go 
as 
far 
as 
wemight;forthesamequestionwould 
alwaysremain. 
Therefore 
it 
must 
be 
that 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
which 
has 
no 
need 
of 
another 
reason, 
be 
outside 
this 
series 
of 
contingent 
things 
and 
be 
found 
in 
a 
substance 
which 
is 
its 
cause, 
or 
which 
is 
a 
necessary 
being, 
carrying 
the 
reason 
of 
its 
existence 
within 
itself; 
otherwise 
we 
should 
still 
not 
have 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
in 
which 
we 
could 
rest. 
And 
this 
final 
reason 
of 
things 
is 
calledGod. 


9. 
This 
simple 
primitive 
substance 
must 
contain 
in 
itself 
eminently 
the 
perfections 
containedinthe 
derivative 
substanceswhich 
are 
its 
effects; 
thusit 
willhave 
perfectpower, 
knowledgeandwill:that 
is,itwillhave 
omnipotence 
and 
sovereign 
goodness. 
And 
as 
justice, 
taken 
generally, 
is 
only 
goodness 
conformed 
to 
wisdom 
there 
must 
too 
be 
sovereign 
justice 
in 
God. 
The 
reason 
which 
has 
caused 
things 
to 
exist 
by 
him, 
makes 
them 
still 
dependent 
upon 
him 
in 
existing 
and 
in 
working: 
and 
they 
are 
continually 
receiving 
from 
him 
that 
which 
gives 
them 
some 
perfection; 
but 
the 
imperfection 
which 
remains 
inthem, 
comesfromtheessential 
andoriginallimitationofthecreature. 
10. 
It 
follows 
from 
the 
supreme 
perfection 
of 
God, 
that 
in 
creating 
the 
universe 
he 
has 
chosen 
the 
best 
possible 
plan, 
in 
which 
there 
is 
the 
greatest 
variety 
together 
with 
the 
greatest 
order; 
the 
best 
arranged 
ground, 
place, 
time; 
the 
most 
results 
produced 
in 
the 
most 
simple 
ways; 
the 
most 
of 
power, 
knowledge, 
happiness 
and 
goodness 
in 
the 
creatures 
that 
the 
universe 
could 

permit. 
For 
since 
all 
the 
possibles 
in 
the 
understanding 
of 
God 
laid 
claim 
to 
existence 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
perfections, 
the 
actual 
world, 
as 
the 
resultant 
of 
all 
these 
claims, 
must 
he 
the 
most 
perfect 
possible. 
And 
without 
this 
it 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
give 
a 
reason 
why 
things 
have 
turned 
out 
so 
rather 
thanotherwise. 


11. 
The 
supreme 
wisdom 
of 
God 
compelled 
him 
to 
choose 
the 
laws 
of 
movement 
best 
adjusted 
and 
most 
suited 
to 
abstract 
or 
metaphysical 
reasons. 
Hepreservestherethesamequantity 
oftotalandabsolute 
force, 
orofactions; 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
respective 
force 
or 
of 
reaction; 
lastly 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
directive 
force. 
Farther, 
action 
is 
always 
equal 
to 
reaction, 
and 
the 
whole 
effect 
is 
always 
equivalent 
to 
the 
full 
cause. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
we 
could 
not 
by 
the 
mere 
consideration 
of 
the 
efficient 
causes 
or 
of 
matter, 
account 
for 
those 
laws 
of 
movement 
which 
have 
been 
discovered 
in 
our 
time, 
and 
a 
part 
of 
which 
have 
been 
discovered 
by 
myself. 
For 
I 
have 
found 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
final 
causes, 
and 
that 
these 
laws 
do 
not 
depend 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
necessity, 
like 
logical, 
arithmetical 
and 
geometrical 
truths, 
but 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
fitness, 
that 
is, 
upon 
the 
choice 
of 
wisdom. 
And 
this 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
efficacious 
and 
evident 
proofs 
of 
the 
existenceofGod,to 
those 
whocanexaminethesemattersthoroughly. 
‘ 
12. 
It 
follows, 
farther, 
from 
the 
perfection 
of 
the 
supreme 
author, 
that 
not 
only 
is 
the 
order 
of 
the 
entire 
universe 
the 
most 
perfect 
possible, 
but 
also 
that 
each 
living 
mirror 
representing 
the 
universe 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
point 
of 
view, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
each 
monad, 
each 
substantial 
centre, 
must 
have 
its 
perceptions 
and 
its 
desires 
as 
well 
regulated 
as 
is 
compatible 
with 
all 
the 
rest. 
Whence 
it 
follows, 
still 
farther, 
that 
souls, 
that 
is, 
the 
most 
dominating 
monads, 
or 
rather, 
animals, 
cannot 
fail 
to 
awaken 
from 
the 
state 
of 
stupor 
in 
which 
deathorsomeotheraccidentmay 
put 
them. 



13. 
For 
everything 
in 
things 
is 
regulated 
once 
for 
all 
with 
as 
much 
order 
and 
harmony 
as 
is 
possible, 
supreme 
wisdom 
and 
goodness 
not 
being 
able 
to 
act 
except 
with 
perfect 
harmony. 
The 
present 
is 
big 
with 
the 
future, 
the 
future 
could 
he 
read 
in 
the 
past, 
the 
distant 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 
near. 
One 
could 
become 
acquainted 
with 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
universe 
in 
each 
soul, 
if 
one 
could 
unfold 
all 
its 
folds, 
which 
only 
develop 
visibly 
in 
time. 
But 
as 
each 
distinct 
perception 
of 
the 
soul 
includes 
innumerable 
confused 
perceptions 
which 
comprise 
the 
whole 
universe, 
the 
soul 
itself 
knows 
the 
things 
of 
which 
it 
has 
perception 
onlysofaras 
ithasdistinctandclearperceptionsofthem. 
Each 
soul 
knows 
the 
infinite, 
knows 
all, 
but 
confusedly. 
As 
in 
walking 
on 
thesea-shore 
and 
hearing 
the 
greatnoise 
which 
it 
makes,I 
hearthe 
individual 
sounds 
of 
each 
wave, 
of 
which 
the 
total 
sound 
is 
composed, 
but 
without 
distinguishing 
them; 
so 
our 
confused 
perceptions 
are 
the 
result 
of 
the 
impressions 
which 
the 
whole 
universe 
makes 
upon 
us. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
each 
monad. 
God 
alone 
has 
a 
distinct 
consciousness 
of 
everything, 
for 
he 
is 
thesource 
of 
all. 
Ithas

said 
that

is 
nowhere,

any

14. 
As 
regards 
the 
rational 
soul, 
or 
spirit, 
there 
is 
something 
in 
it 
more 
than 
in 
the 
monads, 
or 
even 
in 
simple 
souls. 
It 
is 
not 
only 
a 
mirror 
of 
the 
universe 
of 
creatures, 
but 
also 
an 
image 
of 
the 
Divinity. 
The 
spirit 
has 
not 
only 
a 
perception 
of 
the 
works 
of 
God, 
but 
it 
is 
even 
capable 
of 
producing’ 
something 
which 
resembles 
them, 
although 
in 
miniature. 
For, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
the 
marvels 
of 
dreams 
where 
we 
invent 
without 
trouble, 
and 
even 
involuntarily, 
things 
which 
when 
awake 
we 
should 
have 
to 
think 
a 
long 
time 
in 
order 
to 
hit 
upon, 
our 
soul 
is 
architectonic 
in 
its 
voluntary 
actions 
also, 
and, 
discovering 
the 
sciences 
according 
to 
which 
God 
has 
regulated 
things 
(pondéré, 
mensura, 
numéro, 
etc.), 
it 
imitates, 
in 
its 
department 
and 
in 
the 

little 
world 
where 
it 
is 
permitted 
to 
exercise 
itself, 
what 
God 
does 
in 
the 
large 
world. 


15. 
Thisiswhyallspirits,whetherofmenor 
ofgenii,enteringbyvirtueof 
reason 
and 
of 
the 
eternal 
truths 
into 
a 
sort 
of 
society 
with 
God, 
are 
members 
of 
the 
City 
of 
God, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
of 
the 
most 
perfect 
state, 
formed 
and 
governed 
by 
the 
greatest 
and 
best 
of 
monarchs; 
where 
there 
is 
no 
crime 
without 
punishment, 
no 
good 
actions 
without 
proportionate 
recompense; 
and 
finally 
as 
much 
virtue 
and 
happiness 
as 
is 
possible; 
and 
this 
is 
not 
by 
a 
derangement 
of 
nature, 
as 
if 
what 
God 
prepares 
for 
souls 
disturbed 
the 
laws 
of 
bodies, 
but 
by 
the 
very 
order 
of 
natural 
things, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
harmony 
pre-established 
for 
all 
time 
between 
the 
realms 
of, 
nature 
and 
of 
grace, 
between 
God 
as 
Architect 
and 
God 
as 
Monarch; 
so 
that 
nature 
leads 
to 
grace 
and 
grace,while 
making 
useofnature, 
perfectsit. 
16. 
Thus 
although 
reason 
cannot 
teach 
us 
the 
details, 
reserved 
to 
Revelation, 
of 
the 
great 
future, 
we 
can 
be 
assured 
by 
this 
same 
reason 
that 
things 
are 
made 
in 
a 
manner 
surpassing 
our 
desires. 
God 
also 
being 
the 
most 
perfect 
and 
most 
happy, 
and 
consequently, 
the 
most 
lovable 
of 
substances, 
and 
truly 
pure 
love 
consisting 
in 
the 
state 
which 
finds 
pleasure 
in 
the 
perfections 
and 
happiness 
of 
the 
loved 
object, 
this 
love 
ought 
to 
give 
us 
the 
greatestpleasureof 
whichwearecapable,whenGodisitsobject. 
17. 
And 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
love 
him 
as 
we 
ought, 
if 
we 
know 
him 
as 
I 
have 
just 
described. 
For 
although 
God 
is 
not 
visible 
to 
our 
external 
senses, 
he 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
be 
very 
lovable 
and 
to 
give 
very 
great 
pleasure. 
We 
see 
how 
much 
pleasure 
honore 
give 
men, 
although 
they 
do 
not 
at 
all 
consist 
in 
the 
qualities 
oftheexternalsenses. 
Martyrs 
and 
fanatics 
(although 
the 
affection 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
ill-regulated), 
show 
what 
pleasure 
of 
the 
spirit 
can 
accomplish; 
and 
what 
is 
more, 
even 
sensuous 
pleasuresare 
reducedtoconfusedlyknownintellectualpleasures. 



Music 
charms 
us, 
although 
its 
beauty 
only 
consists 
in 
the 
harmony 
of 
numbers 
and 
in 
the 
reckoning 
of 
the 
beats 
or 
vibrations 
of 
sounding 
bodies, 
which 
meet 
at 
certain 
intervals, 
of 
which 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
and 
which 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
cease 
to 
make. 
The 
pleasures 
which 
sight 
finds 
in 
proportions 
areof 
thesame 
nature;andthose 
caused 
bythe 
other 
sensesamount 
to 
almost 
thesamething,althoughwe 
cannotexplainitsoclearly. 


18. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
that 
even 
from 
the 
present 
time 
on, 
the 
love 
of 
God 
makes 
us 
enjoy 
a 
foretaste 
of 
future 
felicity. 
And 
although 
it 
is 
disinterested, 
it 
itself 
constitutes 
our 
greatest 
good 
and 
interest 
even 
if 
we 
should 
not 
seek 
it 
therein 
and 
should 
consider 
only 
the 
pleasure 
which 
it 
gives, 
without 
regard 
to 
the 
utility 
it 
produces; 
for 
it 
gives 
us 
perfect 
confidence 
in 
the 
goodness 
of 
our 
author 
and 
master, 
producing 
a 
true 
tranquillity 
of 
mind; 
not 
like 
the 
Stoics 
who 
force 
themselves’ 
to 
patience, 
but 
by 
a 
present 
content 
which 
assures 
us 
of 
future 
happiness. 
And 
besides 
the 
present 
pleasure, 
nothing 
can 
be 
more 
useful 
for 
the 
future; 
for 
the 
love 
of 
God 
fulfils 
our 
hopes, 
too, 
and 
leads 
us 
in 
the 
road 
of 
supreme 
happiness, 
because 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
perfect 
order 
established 
in 
the 
universe, 
everything 
is 
done 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
way, 
as 
much 
for 
the 
general 
good 
as 
for 
the 
greatest 
individual 
good 
of 
those 
who 
are 
convinced 
of 
this 
and 
are 
content 
with 
the 
divine 
government; 
this 
conviction 
cannot 
he 
wanting 
to 
those 
who 
know 
how 
to 
love 
the 
source 
of 
all 
good. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
supreme 
felicity, 
by 
whatever 
beatific 
vision 
or 
knowledge 
of 
God 
it 
be 
accompanied, 
can 
never 
be 
full; 
because, 
since 
God 
is 
infinite, 
he 
cannot 
be 
wholly 
known. 
Therefore 
our 
happiness 
will 
never, 
and 
ought 
not, 
consist 
in 
full 
joy, 
where 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
farther 
to 
desire, 
rendering 
our 
mind 
stupid; 
but 
in 
a 
perpetual 
progress 
to 
new 
pleasuresandtonewperfections. 

THE 
MONADOLOGY. 
1714. 


[FromtheFrench.] 



1. 
THE 
MONAD 
of 
which 
we 
shall 
here 
speak 
is 
merely 
a 
simple 
substance, 
which 
entersintocompounds; 
simple, 
thatistosay,withoutparts. 
2. 
And 
there 
must 
he 
simple 
substances, 
since 
there 
are 
compound 
substances, 
for 
the 
compound 
is 
only 
a 
collection 
or 
aggregatum 
of 
simple 
substances. 
3. 
How 
where 
there 
are 
no 
parts, 
neither 
extension, 
figure 
nor 
divisibility 
is 
possible. 
And 
these 
monads 
are 
the 
true 
atoms 
of 
nature, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
theelementsof 
things. 
4. 
Dissolution 
also 
is 
not 
at 
all 
to 
be 
feared, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
conceivable 
wayinwhichasimple 
substance 
canperishnaturally. 
5. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
there 
is 
no 
way 
in 
which 
a 
simple 
substance 
can 
beginnaturally,sinceitcannotbe 
formed 
bycomposition. 
6. 
Thus 
it 
may 
he 
said 
that 
the 
monads 
can 
only 
begin 
or 
end 
all 
at 
once, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
they 
can 
only 
begin 
by 
creation 
and 
end 
by 
annihilation; 
whereas 
thatwhichiscompoundbegins 
orendsby 
parts. 
7. 
There 
is 
also 
no 
way 
of 
explaining 
how 
a 
monad 
can 
he 
altered 
or 
changed 
internally 
by 
any 
other 
creature, 
for 
nothing 
can 
he 
transposed 
within 
it, 
nor 
can 
there 
he 
conceived 
in 
it 
any 
internal 
movement 
which 
can 
he 
excited, 
directed, 
augmented 
or 
diminished 
within 
it 
as 
can 
be 
done 
in 
compounds, 
where 
there 
is 
change 
among 
the 
parts. 
The 
monads 
have 
no 
windows 
through 
which 
anything 
can 
enter 
or 
depart. 
The 
accidents 
cannot 
detach 
themselves 
or 
go 
forth 
from 
the 
substances, 
as 
did 
formerly 
the 

sensible 
species 
of 
the 
Schoolmen. 
Likewise 
neither 
substance 
nor 
accident 
can 
enter 
amonad 
fromwithout. 


8. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
monads 
must 
have 
some 
qualities, 
otherwise 
they 
would 
not 
even 
he 
entities. 
And 
if 
simple 
substances 
did 
not 
differ 
at 
all 
in 
their 
qualities 
there 
would 
be 
no 
way 
of 
perceiving 
any 
changes 
in 
things, 
since 
what 
is 
in 
the 
compound 
can 
only 
come 
from 
the 
simple 
ingredients, 
and 
if 
the 
monads 
were 
without 
qualities 
they 
could 
not 
be 
distinguished 
the 
one 
from 
the 
other, 
since 
also 
they 
do 
not 
differ 
in 
quantity. 
Consequently, 
a 
plenum 
being 
supposed, 
each 
place 
in 
any 
movement 
could 
receive 
only 
the 
equivalent 
of 
what 
it 
had 
had 
before, 
and 
one 
state 
of 
things 
would 
not 
be 
distinguishablefrom(another. 
9. 
Moreover 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
each 
monad 
should 
differ 
from 
every 
other. 
For 
never 
in 
nature 
are 
two 
beings 
exactly 
alike 
and 
such 
that 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
find 
an 
internal 
difference 
or 
one 
founded 
upon 
an 
intrinsic 
connotation. 
10. 
I 
take 
it 
also 
for 
granted 
that 
every 
created 
being, 
and 
consequently 
the 
created 
monad 
also, 
is 
subject 
to 
change, 
and 
even 
that 
this 
change 
is 
continualin 
each. 
11. 
It 
follows 
from 
what 
has 
just 
been 
said, 
that 
the 
natural 
changes 
of 
the 
monads 
proceed 
from 
an 
internal 
principle, 
since 
an 
external 
cause 
could 
not 
influencetheirinterior. 
12. 
But 
besides 
the 
principle 
of 
change, 
there 
must 
be 
a 
detail 
of 
that 
which 
changes, 
which 
forms, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
specification 
and 
variety 
of 
the 
simplesubstances. 
13. 
This 
detail 
must 
involve 
multitude 
in 
the 
unity 
or 
in 
the 
simple. 
For 
since 
every 
natural 
change 
is 
made 
by 
degrees, 
something 
changes 
and 
something 
remains; 
consequently, 
there 
must 
be 
in 
the 
simple 
substance 
a 
pluralityofaffections 
andofrelations,althoughnotofparts. 

14. 
The 
transient 
state, 
which 
involves 
and 
represents 
multitude 
in 
unity 
or 
in 
the 
simple 
substance, 
is 
only 
what 
we 
call 
perception, 
which 
must 
be 
distinguished 
from 
apperception 
or 
from 
consciousness, 
as 
will 
appear 
in 
what 
follows. 
Here 
it 
is 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
especially 
failed, 
having 
made 
no 
accountoftheperceptionsof 
whichwearenotconscious. 
Itisthisalso 
which 
made 
them 
suppose 
that 
spirits 
only 
are 
monads 
and 
that 
there 
are 
no 
souls 
of 
brutes 
or 
of 
other 
entelechies. 
They, 
with 
the 
vulgar, 
have 
also 
confounded 
a 
long 
state 
of 
unconsciousness 
with 
death 
strictly 
speaking, 
and 
have 
therefore 
agreed 
with 
the 
old 
scholastic 
prejudice 
of 
entirely 
separate 
souls, 
and 
have 
evenconfirmedweakerminds 
intheirbeliefinthemortalityof 
the 
soul. 
15. 
The 
action 
of 
the 
internal 
principle 
which 
causes 
the 
change 
or 
the 
passage 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another, 
may 
be 
called 
appetition; 
it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
desire 
cannot 
always 
completely 
attain 
to 
the 
whole 
perception 
toward 
which 
it 
tends, 
but 
it 
always 
attains 
to 
something 
of 
it 
and 
arrives 
at 
newperceptions. 
16. 
We 
experience 
in 
ourselves 
multitude 
in 
a 
simple 
substance, 
when 
we 
find 
that 
the 
most 
trifling 
thought 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious 
involves 
variety 
in 
the 
object. 
Thus 
all 
those 
who 
admit 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
simple 
substance 
must 
also 
admit 
this 
multitude 
in 
the 
monad, 
and 
M. 
Bayle 
ought 
not 
to 
find 
init 
‘thedifficultieswhichhe 
mentionsinhis 
Dictionary,article 
Rorarius. 
17. 
We 
must 
confess, 
moreover, 
that 
perception 
and 
that 
which 
depends 
on 
it 
are 
inexplicable 
by 
mechanical 
causes, 
that 
is, 
by 
figures 
and 
motions. 
And, 
supposing 
that 
there 
were 
a 
machine 
so 
constructed 
as 
to 
cause 
thought, 
feelingandperception, 
we 
could 
conceiveofitasenlarged 
andyetpreserving 
the 
same 
proportions, 
so 
that 
we 
might 
enter 
it 
like 
a 
mill. 
And 
this 
granted, 
we 
should 
only 
find 
on 
visiting 
it, 
pieces 
which 
push 
one 
against 
another, 
but 
never 
any 
thing 
by 
which 
to 
explain 
a 
perception. 
It 
must 
be 
sought 
for, 
therefore, 
in 
the 
simple 
substance 
and 
not 
in 
the 
compound 
or 
machine. 

Nothing 
but 
this, 
also, 
can 
be 
found 
in 
the 
simple 
substance; 
and 
it 
is 
in 
this 
alonethatallthe 
internal 
actions 
ofsimplesubstancesconsist. 


18. 
The 
name 
of 
entelechies 
might 
be 
given 
to 
all 
simple 
substances 
or 
created 
monads, 
for 
they 
have 
within 
themselves 
a 
certain 
perfection; 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
sufficiencywhich 
renders 
them 
the 
sources 
of 
their 
internal 
actions, 
and 
soto 
speak, 
incorporealautomata. 
19. 
If 
we 
choose 
to 
give 
the 
name 
soul 
to 
everything 
that 
has 
perceptions 
and 
desires 
in 
the 
general 
sense 
which 
I 
have 
just 
explained, 
all 
simple 
substances 
orcreatedmonadsmaybe 
calledsouls, 
butasfeelingissomething 
more 
than 
a 
simple 
perception, 
I 
consent 
that 
the 
general 
name 
of 
monads 
or 
entelechies 
shall 
suffice 
for 
those 
simple 
substances 
which 
have 
only 
perception, 
and 
that 
only 
those 
substances 
shall 
be 
called 
souls 
whose 
perception 
ismoredistinctandisaccompaniedbymemory. 
20. 
For 
we 
experience 
in 
ourselves 
a 
state 
in 
which 
we 
remember 
nothing 
and 
have 
no 
distinguishable 
perceptions, 
as, 
for 
instance, 
when 
we 
fall 
in 
unconsciousness 
or 
when 
we 
are 
overpowered 
by 
a 
profound 
and 
dreamless 
sleep. 
In 
this 
state 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
differ 
sensibly 
from 
a 
simple 
monad; 
but 
as 
this 
state 
is 
not 
continuous 
and 
as 
the 
soul 
frees 
itself 
from 
it, 
it 
is 
somethingmorethanameremonad. 
21. 
And 
it 
does 
not 
at 
all 
follow 
that 
therefore 
the 
simple 
sub 
stance 
is 
without 
any 
perception. 
This 
is 
indeed 
impossible, 
for 
the 
reasons 
mentioned 
above; 
for 
it 
cannot 
perish, 
nor 
can 
it 
subsist 
without 
some 
affection, 
which 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
perception; 
but 
when 
there 
is 
a 
great 
number 
of 
minute 
perceptions, 
where 
nothing 
is 
distinct, 
we 
are 
stunned, 
as 
when 
we 
turn 
continually 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
many 
times 
in 
succession, 
whence 
arises 
a 
dizziness 
which 
may 
make 
us 
lose 
consciousness, 
and 
which 
does 
not 
allow 
us 
to 
see 
anything 
distinctly. 
So 
death 
may 
for 
a 
time 
produce 
this 
condition 
inanimals. 

22. 
And 
as 
every 
present 
state 
of 
a 
simple 
substance 
is 
naturally 
the 
consequenceofitsprecedingstate, 
soitspresentisbigwithitsfuture. 
23. 
Therefore, 
since 
on 
being 
awakened 
from 
a 
stupor, 
we 
are 
aware 
of 
our 
perceptions, 
we 
must 
have 
had 
them 
immediately 
before 
although 
we 
were 
entirely 
unconscious 
of 
them; 
for 
one 
perception 
can 
only 
come 
naturally 
from 
another 
perception 
as 
one 
motion 
can 
only 
come 
naturally 
fromanothermotion. 
24. 
From 
this 
we 
see 
that 
if 
there 
were 
nothing 
distinct, 
nothing, 
so 
to 
speak, 
in 
relief 
and 
of 
a 
higher 
flavor, 
in 
our 
perceptions, 
we 
should 
always 
bein 
adazedstate. 
This 
istheconditionofthe 
nakedmonad. 
25. 
So 
also 
we 
see 
that 
nature 
has 
given 
to 
animals 
higher 
perceptions, 
by 
the 
pains 
she 
has 
taken 
to 
furnish 
them 
with 
organs 
which 
collect, 
many 
rays 
of 
light 
or 
many 
undulations 
of 
air, 
in 
order 
to 
render 
them 
more 
efficacious 
by 
their 
union. 
There 
is 
something 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
in 
odor, 
in 
taste, 
in 
touch 
and 
perhaps 
in 
a 
multitude 
of 
other 
senses 
which 
are 
unknown 
to 
us. 
I 
shall 
presently 
explain 
how 
that 
which 
takes 
place 
in 
the 
soul 
represents 
that 
which 
occursintheorgans. 
26. 
Memory 
furnishes 
souls 
with 
a 
sort 
of 
consecutiveness 
which 
imitates 
reason, 
but 
which 
ought 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
it. 
We 
observe 
that 
animals, 
having 
the 
perception 
of 
something 
which 
strikes 
them 
and 
of 
which 
they 
have 
had 
a 
similar 
perception 
before, 
expect, 
through 
the 
representations 
of 
their 
memory, 
that 
which 
was 
associated 
with 
it 
in 
the 
preceding 
perception, 
and 
experience 
feelings 
similar 
to 
those 
which 
they 
had 
had 
at 
that 
time. 
For 
instance, 
if 
we 
show 
dogs 
a 
stick, 
they 
remember 
the 
pain 
it 
has 
caused 
them 
and 
whineandrun. 
27. 
And 
the 
powerful 
imagination 
which 
strikes 
and 
moves 
them, 
arises 
either 
from 
the 
magnitude 
or 
the 
multitude 
of 
preceding 
perceptions. 
For 

often 
a 
strong 
impression 
produces 
all 
at 
once 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
long 
continued 
habit, 
or 
ofmanytimesrepeatedmoderateperceptions. 


28. 
Men 
act 
like 
the 
brutes 
in 
so 
far 
as 
that 
the 
consecutiveness 
of 
their 
perceptions 
only 
results 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
memory, 
resembling 
the 
empiricalphysicians 
whopracticewithouttheory,andwearesimpleempirics 
in 
three-fourths 
of 
our 
actions. 
For 
example, 
when 
we 
expect 
that 
there 
will 
be 
daylight 
to-morrow, 
we 
are 
acting 
as 
empirics, 
because 
that 
has 
up 
to 
this 
time 
always 
taken 
place. 
It 
is 
only 
the 
astronomer 
who 
judges 
of 
this 
by 
reason. 
29. 
But 
the 
knowledge 
of 
necessary 
and 
eternal 
truths 
is 
what 
distinguishes 
us 
from 
mere 
animals 
and 
furnishes 
us 
with 
reason 
and 
the 
sciences, 
by 
raising 
us 
to 
a 
knowledge 
of 
ourselves 
and 
of 
God. 
This 
is 
what 
wecallthereasonablesoulor 
spirit 
withinus. 
30. 
It 
is 
also 
by 
the 
knowledge 
of 
necessary 
truths, 
and 
by 
their 
abstractions, 
that 
we 
rise 
to 
acts 
of 
reflection, 
which 
make 
us 
think 
of 
that 
which 
calls 
itself 
“If 
and 
consider 
that 
this 
or 
that 
is 
within 
us; 
and 
it 
is 
thus 
that, 
in 
thinking 
of 
ourselves, 
we 
think 
of 
being, 
of 
substance, 
simple 
or 
compound, 
of 
the 
immaterial 
and 
of 
God 
himself, 
conceiving 
that 
what 
with 
us 
is 
limited 
is 
with 
him 
without 
limit. 
These 
reflective 
acts 
furnish 
the 
principalobjectsofour 
reasonings. 
31. 
Our 
reasonings 
are 
founded 
on 
two 
great 
principles, 
that 
of 
contradiction, 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
we 
judge 
that 
to 
be 
false 
which 
involves 
it, 
and 
that 
true, 
which 
isopposedorcontradictorytothefalse. 
32. 
And 
that 
of 
the 
sufficient 
reason, 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
we 
consider 
that 
no 
fact 
can 
be 
real 
or 
existent, 
no 
statement 
true, 
unless 
there 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
why 
it 
is 
so 
and 
not 
otherwise, 
although 
most 
often 
these 
reasons 
cannotbe 
knowntous. 

33. 
There 
are 
also 
two 
kinds 
of 
truths, 
those 
of 
reasoning 
and 
those 
of 
fact. 
Truths 
of 
reasoning 
are 
necessary 
and 
their 
opposite 
is 
impossible, 
and 
those 
of 
fact 
are 
contingent 
and 
their 
opposite, 
is 
possible. 
When 
a 
truth 
is 
necessary 
its 
reason 
can 
be 
found 
by 
analysis, 
resolving 
it 
into 
more 
simple 
ideasand 
truths 
untilwereachthose 
whichareprimitive. 
34. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
mathematicians 
by 
analysis 
reduce 
speculative 
theorems 
and 
practicalcanons 
to 
definitions, 
axioms 
and 
postulates. 
35. 
Finally 
there 
are 
simple 
ideas, 
definitions 
of 
which 
cannot 
be 
given; 
there 
are 
also 
axioms 
and 
postulates, 
in 
a 
word, 
primary 
principles, 
which 
cannot 
be 
proved 
and 
indeed 
need 
no 
proof, 
and 
these 
are 
identical 
propositions, 
theoppositeofwhichcontains 
anexpresscontradiction. 
36. 
But 
there 
must 
also 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
contingent 
truths, 
or 
those 
of 
fact, 
— 
that 
is, 
for 
the 
series 
of 
things 
diffused 
through 
the 
universe 
of 
created 
objects 
— 
where 
the 
resolution 
into 
particular 
reasons 
might 
run 
into 
a 
detail 
without 
limits, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
immense 
variety 
of 
objects 
and 
the 
division 
of 
bodies 
ad 
infinitum. 
There 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
figures 
and 
of 
movements, 
present 
and 
past, 
which 
enter 
into 
the 
efficient 
cause 
of 
my 
present 
writing, 
and 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
trifling 
inclinations 
and 
dispositions, 
pastandpresent,ofmysoul,whichenterintothefinalcause. 
37. 
And 
as 
all 
this 
detail 
only 
involves 
other 
contingents, 
anterior 
or 
more 
detailed, 
each 
one 
of 
which 
needs 
a 
like 
analysis 
for 
its 
explanation, 
we 
make 
no 
advance, 
and 
the 
sufficient 
or 
final 
reason 
must 
be 
outside 
of 
the 
sequence 
or 
series 
ofthisdetailofcontingencies, 
howeverinfiniteitmaybe. 
38. 
And 
thus 
it 
is 
that 
the 
final 
reason 
of 
things 
must 
be 
found 
in 
a 
necessary 
substance, 
in 
which 
the 
detail 
of 
changes 
exists 
only 
eminently, 
as 
intheir 
source,andthis 
itiswhichwecallGOD. 
39. 
Now 
this 
substance 
being 
the 
sufficient! 
reason 
of 
all 
this 
detail, 
which 
also 
is 
linked 
together 
throughout, 
there 
is 
but 
one 
God, 
and 
this 
God 

suffices. 


40. 
We 
may 
judge 
also 
that 
this 
supreme 
substance, 
which 
is 
unique, 
universal 
and 
necessary, 
having 
nothing 
outside 
of 
itself 
which 
is 
independent 
of 
it, 
and 
being 
the 
simple 
series 
of 
possible 
being, 
must 
be 
incapableoflimitationsand 
mustcontainasmuchofreality 
asis 
possible. 
41. 
Whenceit 
followsthat 
God 
is 
absolutely 
perfect, 
perfection 
being 
only 
the 
magnitude 
of 
positive 
reality 
taken 
in 
its 
strictest 
meaning, 
setting 
aside 
the 
limits 
or 
bounds 
in 
that 
which 
is 
limited. 
And 
there 
where 
there 
are 
no 
limits,that 
is,in 
God,perfectionis 
absolutely 
infinite. 
42. 
It 
follows 
also 
that 
creatures 
have 
their 
perfections 
from 
the 
influence 
of 
God, 
but 
that 
their 
imperfections 
arise 
from 
their 
own 
nature 
incapable 
of 
existingwithoutlimits. 
For 
itis 
bythis 
thatthey 
aredistinguishedfromGod. 
43. 
It 
is 
also 
true 
that 
in 
God 
is 
the 
source 
not 
only 
of 
existences 
but 
also 
of 
essences, 
so 
far 
as 
they 
are 
real, 
or 
of 
that 
which 
is 
real 
in 
the 
possible. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
understanding 
of 
God 
is 
the 
region 
of 
eternal 
truths, 
or 
of 
the 
ideas 
on 
which 
they 
depend, 
and 
because, 
without 
him, 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
real 
in 
the 
possibilities, 
and 
not 
only 
nothing 
existing 
but 
also 
nothingpossible. 
“. 
Nevertheless, 
if 
there 
is 
a 
reality 
in 
the 
essences 
or 
possibilities 
or 
in 
the 
eternal 
truths, 
this 
reality 
must 
be 
founded 
in 
something 
existing 
and 
actual; 
consequently 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
necessary 
being 
in 
whom 
essence 
involves 
existence 
or 
with 
whom 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
be 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
be 
actual. 


45. 
Hence 
God 
(or 
the 
necessary 
being) 
alone 
has 
this 
privilege 
that 
he 
mustexistifit 
ispossible. 
And 
since 
nothing 
canhinderthepossibility 
ofthat 
which 
possesses 
no 
limitations, 
no 
negation, 
and, 
consequently, 
no 
contradiction, 
this 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
to 
establish 
the 
existence 
of 
God 
à 
priori. 
We 
have 
also 
proved 
it 
by 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
eternal 
truths. 
But 
we 
have 

just 
proved 
it 
also 
à 
posteriori, 
since 
contingent 
beings 
exist 
which 
can 
only 
have 
their 
final 
or 
sufficient 
reason 
in 
a 
necessary 
being 
who 
has 
the 
reason 
ofhisexistenceinhimself. 


46. 
But 
it 
must 
not 
be 
imagined, 
as 
is 
sometimes 
done, 
that 
the 
eternal 
truths, 
being 
dependent 
upon 
God, 
are 
arbitrary 
and 
depend 
upon 
his 
will, 
as 
Descartes 
seems 
to 
have 
conceived, 
and 
afterwards 
M. 
Poiret. 
This 
is 
true 
only 
of 
contingent 
truths, 
the 
principle 
of 
which 
is 
fitness 
or 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
best, 
whereas 
necessary 
truths 
depend 
solely 
on 
his 
understanding 
and 
are 
its 
internalobject. 
47. 
Thus 
God 
alone 
is 
the 
primitive 
unity 
or 
the 
original 
simple 
substance; 
of 
which 
all 
monads, 
created 
or 
derived, 
are 
the 
products, 
and 
are 
born, 
so 
to 
speak, 
from 
moment 
to 
moment 
by 
continual 
fulgurations 
of 
the 
Divinity, 
limitedbythereceptivity 
ofthecreature, 
towhich 
limitation 
isessential. 
48. 
In 
God 
is 
Power, 
which 
is 
the 
source 
of 
all; 
then 
Knowledge, 
which 
contains 
the 
detail 
of 
ideas; 
and 
finally 
Will, 
which 
effects 
changes 
or 
products 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
best. 
It 
is 
this 
which 
corresponds 
to 
what 
in 
created 
monads 
forms 
the 
subject 
or 
basis, 
the 
perceptive 
and 
the 
appetitive 
faculty. 
But 
in 
God 
these 
attributes 
are 
absolutely 
infinite 
or 
perfect, 
and 
in 
the 
created 
monads 
or 
in 
the 
entelechies 
(or 
perfectihabies, 
as 
Harmolaus 
Barbaras 
translated 
the 
word), 
they 
are 
only 
imitations 
proportionedtotheirperfection. 
49. 
The 
creature 
is 
said 
to 
act 
externally 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
perfect, 
and 
to 
suffer 
from 
another 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
imperfect. 
Thus 
action 
is 
attributed 
to 
the 
monad 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
has 
distinct 
perceptions, 
and 
passion 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
has 
confusedperceptions. 
50. 
And 
one 
creature 
is 
more 
perfect 
than 
another 
in 
that 
there 
is 
found 
in 
it 
that 
which 
serves 
to 
account 
à 
priori 
for 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
another, 
and 
it 
is 
inthis 
waythatitissaidtoact 
uponanother. 

51. 
But 
in 
simple 
substances 
the 
influence 
of 
one 
monad, 
upon 
another 
is 
purely 
ideal, 
since 
it 
can 
take 
effect 
only 
through 
the 
introduction 
of 
God, 
inasmuch 
as 
in 
the 
ideas 
of 
God 
a 
monad 
may 
demand 
with 
reason 
that 
God 
in 
regulating 
the 
others 
from 
the 
commencement 
of 
things, 
have 
regard 
to 
it. 
For 
since 
a 
created 
monad 
can 
have 
no 
physical 
influence 
upon 
the 
interior 
of 
another,itisonlyinthiswaythatone 
canbe 
dependentupon 
another. 
52. 
And 
hence 
it 
is 
that 
the 
actions 
and 
passions 
of 
creatures 
are 
mutual. 
For 
God, 
in 
comparing 
two 
simple 
substances, 
finds 
in 
each 
one 
reasons 
which 
compel 
him 
to 
adjust 
the 
other 
to 
it, 
and 
consequently 
that 
which 
in 
certain 
respects 
is 
active, 
is 
according 
to 
another 
point 
of 
view, 
passive; 
active 
insofaras 
thatwhatisknowndistinctlyinit, 
servesto 
account 
forthat 
which 
takes 
place 
in 
another; 
and 
passive 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
what 
takes 
placeinit,is 
foundinthatwhichis 
distinctlyknownin 
another. 
53. 
Now, 
as 
there 
is 
an 
infinity 
of 
possible 
universes 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
God, 
and 
as 
only 
one 
of 
them 
can 
exist, 
there 
must 
he 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
the 
choiceof 
God,whichdetermineshimforone 
ratherthan 
for 
another. 
54. 
And 
this 
reason 
can 
only 
he 
found 
in 
the 
fitness, 
in 
the 
degrees 
of 
perfection, 
which 
these 
worlds 
contain, 
each 
possible 
world 
having 
a 
right 
to 
claimexistenceaccording 
tothemeasure 
ofperfection 
whichitpossesses. 
55. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
Best, 
which 
wisdom 
makes 
known 
to 
God, 
which 
his 
goodness 
chooses 
and 
which 
his 
power 
produces. 
56. 
Now 
this 
connection, 
or 
this 
adaptation 
of 
all 
created 
things 
to 
each 
and 
of 
each 
to 
all, 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
each 
simple 
substance 
has 
relations 
which 
express 
all 
the 
others, 
and 
that 
consequently 
it 
is 
a 
living, 
perpetual 
mirrorofthe 
universe. 
57. 
And 
as 
the 
same 
city 
regarded 
from 
different 
sides 
appears 
entirely 
different 
and 
in 
perspective 
is 
as 
if 
‘multiplied, 
so 
also 
it 
happens 
that, 

because 
of 
the 
infinite 
multiplicity 
of 
simple 
substances, 
there 
are 
as 
it 
were 
so 
manydifferentuniverses, 
which 
are 
nevertheless 
only 
the 
perspectives 
of 
a 
single 
one, 
fromthe 
different 
points 
of 
view 
of 
eachmonad. 


58. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
way 
to 
obtain 
asgreat 
a 
varietyas 
possible, 
but 
with 
the 
greatest 
possible 
order; 
that 
is, 
it 
is 
the 
way 
to 
obtain 
as 
much 
perfection 
as 
possible. 
59. 
Thus 
this 
hypothesis 
(which 
I 
dare 
to 
assert 
is 
demonstrated) 
is 
the 
only 
one 
which 
brings 
into 
relief 
the 
grandeur 
of 
God. 
M. 
Bayle 
recognized 
this, 
when 
in 
his 
Dictionary 
(Art. 
Rorarius) 
he 
objected 
to 
it; 
where 
indeed 
he 
was 
tempted 
to 
believethatI 
accordedtoGod 
more 
thanwaspossible. 
Buthe 
can 
state 
no 
reason 
why 
this 
universal 
harmony 
which 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
each 
substance 
expresses 
exactly 
all 
others 
by 
the 
relations 
which 
it 
sustains 
tothem, 
isimpossible. 
60. 
Besides, 
we 
canseein 
whatI 
have 
justsaidà 
priorireasons 
whythings 
could 
not 
be 
otherwise, 
because 
God, 
in 
regulating 
all, 
has 
regard 
to 
each 
part, 
and 
particularly 
to 
each 
monad, 
since, 
its 
nature 
being 
representative, 
nothing 
can 
limit 
it 
to 
representing 
only 
a 
part 
of 
things; 
although 
it 
may 
be 
true 
that 
this 
representation 
is 
but 
confused 
as 
regards 
the 
detail 
of 
the 
whole 
universe, 
and 
can 
be 
distinct 
only 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
small 
part 
of 
things, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
those 
which 
are 
nearest 
or 
largest 
in 
relation 
to 
each 
of 
themonads 
—otherwiseeachmonad 
wouldbe 
adivinity. 
It 
is 
not 
in 
the 
object 
but 
only 
in 
the 
modification 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
object, 
that 
monads 
are 
limited. 
They 
all 
tend 
confusedly 
toward 
the 
infinite, 
toward 
the 
whole, 
but 
they 
are 
limited, 
and 
distinguished 
by 
their 
degrees 
of 
distinctperceptions. 


61. 
And 
in 
this 
respect 
compound 
substances 
symbolize 
with 
simple 
substances. 
Forsincethe 
worldisa 
plenum,makingallmatterconnected,and 
since 
in 
a 
plenum 
every 
movement 
has 
some 
effect 
on 
distant 
bodies 
in 

proportion 
to 
their 
distance, 
so 
that 
each 
body 
is 
affected 
not 
only 
by 
those 
which 
touch 
it 
and 
feels 
in 
some 
way 
all 
that 
happens 
to 
them 
but 
also 
by 
their 
means 
is 
affected 
by 
those 
which 
touch 
the 
first 
with 
which 
it 
is 
in 
immediate 
contact, 
it 
follows 
that 
thiscommunicationextends 
to 
any 
distance 
whatever. 
Consequently, 
each 
body 
feels 
all 
that 
passes 
in 
the 
universe, 
so 
that 
he 
who 
sees 
all, 
could 
read 
in 
each 
that 
which 
passes 
everywhere 
else, 
and 
even 
that 
which 
has 
been 
or 
shall 
be, 
perceiving 
in 
the 
present 
that 
which 
is 
removed 
in 
time 
as 
well 
as 
in 
space; 
συμπνοια 
παντα, 
said 
Hippocrates. 
But 
a 
soul 
can 
read 
in 
itself 
only 
that 
which 
is 
distinctly 
represented 
in 
it. 
It 
cannotdevelopitslaws 
allatonce, 
for 
theyreach 
intotheinfinite. 


62. 
Thus, 
although 
each 
created 
monad 
represents 
the 
entire 
universe, 
it 
represents 
most 
distinctly 
the 
body 
which 
is 
particularly 
appropriated 
to 
it 
and 
of 
which 
it 
forms 
the 
entelechy; 
and 
as 
this 
body 
represents 
the 
whole 
universe 
by 
the 
connection 
of 
all 
matter 
in 
a 
plenum, 
the 
soul 
also 
represents 
thewhole 
universebyrepresentingthatbodywhich 
especiallybelongstoit. 
63. 
The 
body 
belonging 
to 
a 
monad, 
which 
is 
its 
entelechy 
or 
soul, 
constitutes, 
with 
the 
entelechy, 
what 
may 
be 
called 
a 
living 
being, 
and 
with 
the 
soul, 
what 
may 
be 
called 
an 
animal. 
Now 
this 
body 
of 
a 
living 
being 
or 
of 
an 
animal 
is 
always 
organic, 
for 
since 
every 
monad 
is 
in 
its 
way 
a 
mirror 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
since 
the 
universe 
is 
arranged 
in 
perfect 
order, 
there 
must 
also 
be 
order 
in 
the 
representative, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
soul, 
and 
hence 
inthebody,accordingtowhichtheuniverseisrepresented 
init. 
64. 
Thus 
each 
organic 
body 
of 
a 
living 
being 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
divine 
machine 
or 
natural 
automaton, 
which 
infinitely 
surpasses 
all 
artificial 
automata, 
because 
a 
machine 
which 
is 
made 
by 
man’s 
art 
is 
not 
a 
machine 
in 
each 
one 
of 
its 
parts; 
for 
example, 
the 
tooth 
of 
a 
brass 
wheel 
has 
parts 
or 
fragments 
which 
to 
us 
are 
no 
longer 
artificial 
and 
have 
nothing 
in 
themselves 
to 
show 
the 
use 
to 
which 
the 
wheel 
was 
destined 
in 
the 
machine. 
But 
nature’s 

machines, 
that 
is, 
living 
bodies, 
are 
machines 
even 
in 
their 
smallest 
parts 
ad 
infinitum. 
Herein 
lies 
the 
difference 
between 
nature 
and 
art, 
that 
is, 
between 
thedivineartandours. 


65. 
And 
the 
author 
of 
nature 
has 
been 
able 
to 
contrive 
these 
divine 
and 
infinitely 
marvellous 
works 
of 
art, 
because 
each 
portion 
of 
matter 
is 
not 
only 
divisible 
ad 
infinitum, 
as 
the 
ancients 
perceived, 
but 
also 
each 
part 
is 
actually 
endlessly 
subdivided 
into 
parts 
of 
which 
each 
has 
its 
own 
motion: 
otherwise 
it 
wouldbeimpossibleforeachportionofmattertoexpress 
theuniverse. 
66. 
Hence 
we 
see 
that 
there 
is 
a 
world 
of 
creatures, 
of 
living 
beings, 
of 
animals,ofentelechies,ofsouls, 
inthesmallest 
particleofmatter. 
67. 
Each 
portion 
of 
matter 
may 
be 
conceived 
of 
as 
a 
garden 
full 
of 
plants, 
and 
as 
a 
pond 
full 
of 
fishes. 
But 
each 
branch 
of 
the 
plant, 
each 
member 
of 
the 
animal,each 
dropofits 
humors 
isalso 
suchagardenorsucha 
pond. 
68. 
And 
although 
the 
earth 
or 
air 
embraced 
between 
the 
plants 
of 
the 
garden, 
or 
the 
water 
between 
the 
fish 
of 
the 
pond, 
is 
neither 
plant 
nor 
fish, 
they 
yet 
contain 
more 
of 
them, 
but 
for 
the 
most 
part 
so 
tiny 
as 
to 
be 
to 
us 
imperceptible. 
69. 
Therefore 
there 
is 
nothing 
uncultivated, 
nothing 
sterile, 
nothing 
dead 
in 
the 
universe, 
no 
chaos, 
no 
confusion 
except 
in 
appearance. 
Just 
as 
a 
pond 
would 
appear 
from 
a 
distance 
in 
which 
we 
might 
see 
the 
confused 
movement 
and 
swarming, 
so 
to 
speak, 
of 
the 
fishes 
in 
the 
pond, 
without 
perceiving 
the 
fish 
themselves. 
70. 
We 
see 
thus 
that 
each 
living 
body 
has 
a 
ruling 
entelechy 
which 
is 
the 
soul 
in 
the 
animal, 
but 
the 
members 
of 
this 
living 
body 
are 
full 
of 
other 
living 
beings 
— 
plants, 
animals 
— 
each 
of 
which 
has 
also 
its 
entelechy 
or 
governingsoul. 
71. 
But 
it 
must 
not 
be 
imagined, 
as 
has 
been 
done 
by 
some 
people 
who 
have 
misunderstood 
my 
thought, 
that 
each 
soul 
has 
a 
mass 
or 
portion 
of 

matter 
appropriated 
to 
it 
or 
united 
to 
it 
forever, 
and 
that 
hence 
it 
possesses 
other 
inferior 
living 
beings 
destined 
to 
its 
service 
forever. 
For 
all 
bodies 
are, 
like 
rivers, 
in 
a 
perpetual 
flux, 
and 
parts 
are 
entering 
into 
them 
and 
departing 
fromthemcontinually. 


72. 
Thus 
the 
soul 
changes 
its 
body 
only 
gradually 
and 
by 
degrees, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
never 
deprived 
of 
all 
its 
organs 
at 
once. 
There 
is 
often 
a 
metamorphosis 
in 
animals, 
but 
never 
metempsychosis 
nor 
transmigration 
of 
souls. 
There 
are 
also 
no 
entirely 
separate 
souls, 
nor 
genii 
without 
bodies. 
God 
alone 
is 
wholly 
withoutbody. 
73. 
For 
which 
reason 
also, 
it 
happens 
that 
there 
is, 
strictly 
speaking, 
neither 
completegeneration 
nor 
entire 
death, 
where 
thesoulis 
separated 
from 
the 
body. 
What 
we 
call 
generation 
is 
development 
or 
increase, 
as 
also 
what 
wecall 
death 
isenvelopment 
anddiminution. 
74. 
Philosophers 
have 
been 
greatly 
puzzled 
over 
the 
origin 
of 
forms, 
entelechies, 
or 
souls; 
but 
to-day, 
when 
we 
know 
by 
exact 
investigations 
of 
plants, 
insects 
and 
animals, 
that 
organic 
bodies 
in 
nature 
are 
never 
produced 
from 
chaos 
or 
from 
putrefaction, 
but 
always 
from 
seeds, 
in 
which 
there 
was 
undoubtedly 
some 
pre-formation, 
it 
has 
been 
thought 
that 
not 
only 
the 
organic 
body 
was 
already 
there 
before 
conception, 
but 
also 
a 
soul 
in 
this 
body, 
and, 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
animal 
itself; 
and 
that 
by 
means 
of 
conception 
this 
animal 
has 
merely 
been 
disposed 
to 
a 
greater 
transformation, 
in 
order 
to 
become 
an 
animal 
of 
another 
kind. 
Something 
similar 
is 
seen 
outside 
of 
generation,aswhenworms 
becomeflies,and 
caterpillars,butterflies. 
75. 
The 
animals, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
raised 
by 
conception 
to 
the 
grade 
of 
larger 
animals, 
may 
be 
called 
spermatics; 
but 
those 
among 
them, 
which 
remain 
in 
their 
class, 
that 
is, 
the 
most 
part, 
are 
born, 
multiply, 
and 
are 
destroyed 
like 
the 
larger 
animals, 
and 
there 
is 
only 
a 
small 
number 
of 
chosen 
ones, 
whichpass 
toalargertheatre. 

76. 
But 
this 
were 
only 
half 
the 
truth; 
I 
have 
therefore 
thought 
that 
if 
the 
animal 
never 
has 
a 
natural 
beginning, 
it 
cannot 
end 
naturally; 
and 
that 
not 
onlywilltherebenogeneration,butalso 
noutterdestruction, 
ordeathstrictly 
speaking. 
And 
these 
reasonings, 
made 
à 
posteriori 
and 
drawn 
from 
experience, 
harmonizeperfectlywith 
principles 
deduced 
à 
priori, 
as 
above. 
77. 
Thus 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
not 
only 
the 
soul 
(mirror 
of 
an 
indestructible 
universe) 
is 
indestructible, 
but 
also 
the 
animal 
itself, 
although 
its 
machine 
oftenperishes 
inpart 
andtakeson 
orputsofforganicspoils. 
78. 
These 
principles 
have 
given 
me 
the 
means 
of 
explaining 
naturally 
the 
union 
or 
rather 
the 
conformity 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
organic 
body. 
The 
soul 
follows 
its 
own 
peculiar 
laws 
and 
the 
body 
also 
follows 
its 
own 
laws, 
and 
they 
meet 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
pre-established, 
harmony 
between 
all 
substances, 
sincetheyareallrepresentationsofoneand 
thesameuniverse. 
79. 
Souls 
act 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
final 
causes, 
by 
appetitions, 
ends 
and 
means. 
Bodies 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
laws 
of 
efficient 
causes 
or 
of 
motion. 
And 
the 
two 
realms, 
that 
of 
efficient 
causes 
and 
that 
of 
final 
causes, 
areinharmony 
witheachother. 
80. 
Descartes 
recognized 
that 
souls 
cannot 
give 
any 
force 
to 
bodies, 
because 
there 
is 
always 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
force 
in 
matter; 
nevertheless 
he 
believed 
that 
the 
soul 
could 
change 
the 
direction 
of 
bodies. 
But 
it 
was 
because, 
in 
his 
day, 
the 
law 
of 
nature 
which 
enforces 
the 
conservation 
of 
the 
total 
direction 
in 
matter, 
was 
not 
known. 
If 
he 
had 
known 
this, 
he 
would 
have 
lighteduponmysystemofthepre-established 
harmony. 
81. 
By 
this 
system 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
bodies 
act 
as 
if 
(what 
is 
impossible) 
there 
were 
no 
souls, 
and 
that 
souls 
act 
as 
if 
there 
were 
no 
bodies, 
and 
that 
bothactas 
ifeachinfluencedtheother. 
82. 
As 
tospirits 
orrationalsouls,althoughI 
findthatthe 
same 
thing 
which 
Ihave 
stated 
— 
namely,thatanimals 
and 
souls 
begin 
only 
withthe 
world 
and 

end 
only 
with 
the 
world 
— 
holds 
good 
at 
bottom 
with 
regard 
to 
all 
animals 
and 
living 
things, 
yet 
there 
is 
this 
peculiarity 
in 
rational 
animals, 
that 
their 
spermatic 
animalcules, 
as 
such, 
have 
only 
ordinary 
or 
sensitive 
souls, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
those 
which 
are, 
so 
to 
speak, 
elected, 
attain 
by 
actual 
conception 
to 
human 
nature, 
their 
sensitive 
souls 
are 
elevated 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
reason 
and 
to 
the 
prerogative 
of 
spirits, 
83. 
Among 
other 
differences 
which 
exist 
between 
ordinary 
souls 
and 
spirits, 
a 
part 
of 
which 
I 
have 
already 
mentioned, 
there 
is 
furthermore, 
this, 
that 
souls 
in 
general 
are 
the 
living 
mirrors 
or 
images 
of 
the 
universe 
of 
creatures, 
but 
spirits 
are 
in 
addition 
images 
of 
the 
Divinity 
itself, 
or 
of 
the 
author 
of 
nature, 
able 
to 
know 
the 
system 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
to 
imitate 
something 
of 
it 
by 
architectonic 
samplings, 
since 
every 
spirit 
is 
as 
a 
littledivinityinits 
owndepartment. 


84. 
Hence 
it 
comes 
about 
that 
spirits 
are 
capable 
of 
entering 
into 
a 
sort 
of 
society 
with 
God, 
and 
that 
he 
is, 
in 
relation 
to 
them, 
not 
only 
what 
an 
inventor 
is 
to 
his 
machines 
(as 
God 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
other 
creatures), 
but 
also 
what 
aprinceistohissubjects 
andeven 
afathertohischildren. 
85. 
Whence 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
conclude 
that 
the 
assembly 
of 
all 
spirits 
must 
compose 
the 
City 
of 
God, 
that 
is, 
the 
most 
perfect 
state 
which 
is 
possible, 
underthe 
mostperfectofmonarchs. 
86. 
This 
City 
of 
God, 
this 
truly 
universal 
monarchy, 
is 
a 
moral 
world 
within 
the 
natural 
world, 
and 
the 
highest 
and 
most 
divine 
of 
the 
works 
of 
God; 
it 
is 
in 
this 
that 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
truly 
consists, 
for 
he 
would 
have 
none 
if 
his 
greatness 
and 
goodness 
were 
not 
known 
and 
admired 
by 
spirits. 
It 
is, 
too, 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
divine 
city 
that 
he 
possesses, 
properly, 
goodness; 
whilehiswisdom,andpowerareeverywheremanifest. 
81. 
As 
we 
have 
above 
established 
perfect 
harmony 
between 
two 
natural 
kingdoms, 
the 
one 
of 
efficient, 
the 
other 
of 
final 
causes, 
we 
should 
also 
notice 
here 
another 
harmony 
between 
the 
physical 
kingdom 
of 
nature 
and 
the 

moral 
kingdom 
of 
grace; 
that 
is, 
between 
God 
considered 
as 
the 
architect 
of 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
God, 
considered 
as 
monarch 
of 
the 
divine 
city 
ofspirits. 


88. 
This 
harmony 
makes 
all 
things 
progress 
toward 
grace 
by 
natural 
methods. 
This 
globe, 
for 
example, 
must 
be 
destroyed 
and 
repaired 
by 
natural 
means, 
at 
such 
times 
as 
the 
government 
of 
spirits 
may 
demand 
it, 
for 
the 
punishmentof 
someandtherewardofothers. 
89. 
It 
may 
be 
said, 
farther, 
that 
God 
as 
architect 
satisfies 
in 
every 
respect 
God 
as 
legislator, 
and 
that 
therefore 
sins, 
by 
the 
decree 
of 
nature 
and 
by 
virtue 
even 
of 
the 
mechanical 
structure 
of 
things, 
must 
carry 
their 
punishment 
with 
them; 
and 
that 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
good 
actions 
will 
obtain 
their 
rewards 
by 
mechanical 
ways 
through 
their 
relation 
to 
bodies, 
although 
this 
may 
not 
and 
ought 
not 
alwayshappenimmediately. 
90. 
Finally, 
under 
this 
perfect 
government, 
there 
will 
be 
no 
good 
action 
without 
reward, 
no 
bad 
action 
without 
punishment, 
and 
everything 
must 
result 
for 
the 
well-being 
of 
the 
good, 
that 
is, 
of 
those 
who 
are 
not 
discontented 
in 
this 
great 
State, 
who, 
after 
having 
done 
their 
duty, 
trust 
in 
providence, 
and 
who 
love 
and 
imitate 
as 
they 
ought 
the 
author 
of 
all 
good, 
pleasing 
themselves 
with 
the 
contemplation 
of 
his 
perfections, 
— 
according 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
truly 
pure 
love, 
which 
takes 
pleasure 
in 
the 
happiness 
of 
the 
loved 
one. 
This 
is 
what 
causes 
wise 
and 
virtuous 
persons 
to 
work 
at 
all 
which 
seems 
conformable 
to 
the 
divine 
will, 
presumptive 
or 
antecedent, 
and 
yet 
to 
content 
themselves 
with 
that 
which 
God 
in 
reality 
sends 
by 
his 
secret, 
consequent 
and 
decisive 
will, 
recognizing 
that 
if 
we 
could 
sufficiently 
comprehend 
the 
order 
of 
the 
universe 
we 
would 
find 
that 
it 
surpassed 
all 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
wisest, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
render 
it 
better 
that 
it 
is, 
not 
only 
for 
all 
in 
general, 
but 
also 
for 
ourselves 
in 
particular, 
if 
we 
are 
attached, 
as 
we 
should 
be, 
to 
the 
author 
of 
all, 
not 
only 
as 
the 
architect 
and 
efficient 

cause 
of 
our 
being, 
but 
also 
as 
our

and

[FromtheFrench.] 



SIR, 
I 
HAVE 
just 
received 
your 
package, 
and 
I 
thank 
you 
for 
the 
interesting 
articles 
which 
you 
have 
sent 
me. 
I 
say 
nothing 
on 
the 
continuation 
of 
Homer; 
but 
as, 
after 
the 
sacred 
books, 
he 
is 
the 
most 
ancient 
of 
all 
the 
authors 
whose 
works 
remain 
to 
us, 
I 
wish 
that 
some 
one 
would 
undertake 
to 
clear 
up 
the 
historical 
and 
geographical 
difficulties 
which 
remote 
antiquity 
has 
produced 
in 
these 
works, 
and 
principally 
in 
the 
Odyssey, 
relating 
to 
ancient 
geography; 
for, 
however 
fabulous 
the 
travels 
of 
Ulysses 
may 
be, 
it 
is 
nevertheless 
certain 
that 
Homer 
carried 
him 
into 
countries 
then 
spoken 
of 
but 
which 
it 
is 
difficult 
nowtorecognize. 


I 
pass 
to 
the 
philosophical 
articles 
which 
relate 
to 
the 
Reverend 
Father 
Malebranche 
(whose 
loss 
I 
greatly 
regret), 
and 
which 
tend 
to 
elucidate 
the 
natural 
theology 
of 
the 
Chinese. 
The 
Refutation 
of 
the 
system 
of 
this 
Father, 
divided 
into 
three 
small 
volumes, 
is 
without 
doubt 
from 
a 
man 
of 
ability, 
for 
it 
is 
clear 
and 
ingenious. 
I 
even 
approve 
of 
a 
part 
of 
it, 
but 
part 
of 
it 
is 
too 
extreme. 
Too 
much 
divergence 
is 
here 
shown 
from 
the 
views 
of 
Descartes 
and 
of 
Father 
Malebranche, 
even 
when 
they 
receive 
a 
good 
meaning. 
It 
should 
be 
time 
to 
give 
up 
these 
enmities, 
which 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
perhaps 
drawn 
upon 
themselves 
by 
showing 
too 
much 
contempt 
for 
the 
ancients 
and 
for 
the 
schoolmen, 
in 
whom 
there 
is 
nevertheless 
solidity 
meriting 
our 
attention. 
Thus 
justice 
ought 
to 
be 
shown 
on 
the 
one 
side 
and 
on 
the 
other, 



and 
we 
are 
to 
profit 
by 
the 
discoveries 
of 
both, 
as 
it 
is 
right 
to 
reject 
that 
which 
eachadvanceswithoutfoundation. 


1. 
It 
is 
right 
to 
refute 
the 
Cartesians 
when 
they 
say 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
nothing 
but 
thought; 
as 
also 
when 
they 
say 
that 
matter 
is 
nothing 
but 
extension. 
For 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
subject 
or 
concretum 
which 
thinks, 
and 
matter 
is 
an 
extended 
subject 
orsubject 
endowed 
with 
extension. 
ThisiswhyI 
hold 
that 
space 
must 
not 
be 
con 
founded 
with 
matter, 
although 
I 
agree 
that 
naturally 
there 
is 
no 
void 
space; 
the 
scholastics 
are 
right 
in 
distinguishing 
the 
concretes 
and 
the 
abstracts, 
when 
itisa 
matterofexactness. 
2. 
I 
concede 
to 
the 
Cartesians 
that 
the 
soul 
actually 
always 
thinks, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
grant 
that 
it 
is 
conscious 
of 
all 
these 
thoughts. 
For 
our 
great 
perceptions 
and 
our 
great 
appetites 
of 
which 
we 
are 
conscious, 
are 
composed 
of 
innumerable 
little 
perceptions 
and 
little 
inclinations 
of 
which 
we 
cannot 
be 
conscious. 
And 
it 
is 
in 
the 
insensible 
perceptions 
that 
the 
reason 
is 
found 
of 
what 
passes 
in 
us; 
as 
the 
reason 
of 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
sensible 
bodies 
consistsininsensiblemovements. 
3. 
There 
is 
good 
reason 
also 
for 
refuting 
Reverend 
Father 
Malebranche 
especially 
when 
he 
maintains 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
purely 
passive. 
I 
think 
I 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
every 
substance 
is 
active, 
and 
especially 
the 
soul. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
idea 
which 
the 
ancients 
and 
the 
moderns 
have 
had 
of 
it; 
and 
the 
entelechy 
of 
Aristotle, 
which 
has 
made 
so 
much 
noise, 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
force 
or 
activity; 
that 
is, 
a 
state 
from 
which 
action 
naturally 
flows 
if 
nothing 
hinders 
it. 
But 
matter, 
primary 
and 
pure, 
taken 
without 
the 
souls 
or 
lives 
which 
are 
united 
to 
it, 
is 
purely 
passive; 
properly 
speaking 
also 
it 
is 
not 
a 
substance, 
but 
something 
incomplete. 
And 
secondary 
matter, 
as 
for 
example, 
body, 
is 
not 
a 
substance, 
but 
for 
another 
reason; 
which 
is, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
collection 
of 
several 
substances, 
like 
a 
pond 
full 
of 
fish, 
or 
a 
flock 
of 
sheep; 
and 
consequently 
it 
is 
what 
is 
called 
unum 
per 
accidens, 
in 
a 
word, 
a 

phenomenon. 
A 
true 
substance, 
such 
as 
an 
animal, 
is 
composed 
of 
an 
immaterial 
soul, 
and 
an 
organized 
body; 
and 
it 
is 
the 
compound 
of 
these 
two 
which 
iscalled 
unum 
per 
se. 


4. 
As 
to 
the 
efficiency 
of 
second 
causes, 
it 
is 
again 
right 
to 
maintain 
it 
against 
the 
opinion 
of 
this 
Father. 
I 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
each 
simple 
substance, 
or 
monad 
(such 
as 
souls), 
follows 
its 
own 
laws 
in 
producing 
its 
actions, 
without 
being 
capable 
of 
being 
troubled 
therein 
by 
the 
influence 
of 
another 
created 
simple 
substance; 
and 
that 
thus 
bodies 
do 
not 
change 
the 
ethico-logical 
laws 
of 
souls, 
any 
more 
than 
souls 
change 
the 
physicomechanical 
laws 
of 
bodies. 
This 
is 
why 
second 
causes 
really 
act, 
but 
without 
any 
influence 
of 
one 
created 
simple 
substance 
upon 
another; 
and 
souls 
harmonize 
with 
bodies 
and 
among 
themselves, 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
preëstablished 
harmony, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
by 
a 
mutual 
physical 
influence; 
except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
metaphysical 
union 
of 
the 
soul 
and 
its 
body 
which 
makes 
them 
compose 
unum, 
per 
se, 
an 
animal, 
a 
living 
being.. 
It 
has 
been 
right, 
therefore, 
to 
refute 
the 
opinion 
of 
those 
who 
deny 
the 
action 
of 
second 
causes; 
but 
it 
must 
be 
donewithoutrenewingfalseinfluences,suchasthe 
species 
oftheschool. 
5. 
Father 
Malebranche 
made 
use 
of 
this 
argument: 
That 
extension 
not 
being 
a 
mode 
of 
being 
of 
matter, 
must 
be 
its 
substance. 
The 
author 
of 
the 
Refutation 
(Vol. 
I, 
p. 
91), 
distinguishes 
between 
the 
positive 
modes 
of 
being; 
and 
he 
claims 
that 
extension 
is 
one 
of 
the 
modes 
of 
being 
of 
the 
second 
sort, 
which 
he 
thinks 
can 
be 
conceived 
by 
themselves. 
But 
these 
are 
not 
positive 
modes 
of 
being; 
they 
all 
consist 
in 
the 
variety 
oflimitations, 
and 
allcannot 
be 
conceivedsave 
by 
the 
beingof 
which 
they 
are 
themodesandways. 
And 
as 
to 
extension 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
mode 
of 
being 
of 
matter, 
and 
nevertheless 
is 
not 
a 
substance 
either. 
What 
is 
it, 
then? 
you 
will 
ask, 
sir. 
I 
reply 
that 
it 
is 
an 
attribute 
of 
substances, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
difference 
between 
attributes 
andmodesofbeing. 

6. 
It 
appears 
to 
me, 
also, 
that 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Refutation 
does 
not 
well 
combat 
the 
opinion 
of’ 
the 
Cartesians 
on 
the 
infinite, 
which 
they 
with 
reason 
consider 
as 
prior 
to 
the 
finite, 
and 
of 
which 
the 
finite 
is 
but 
a 
limitation. 
He 
says 
(p. 
303 
of 
Vol. 
I), 
that 
if 
the 
mind 
had 
a 
clear 
and 
direct 
view 
of 
the 
infinite, 
Father 
Malebranche 
would 
not 
have 
had 
need 
of 
so 
much 
reasoning 
to 
make 
us 
think 
of 
it. 
But 
by 
the 
same 
argument 
he 
would 
reject 
the 
very 
simple 
and 
very 
natural 
knowledge 
we 
have 
of 
the 
Divinity. 
These 
kinds 
of 
objections 
amount 
to 
nothing, 
for 
there 
is 
need 
of 
labor 
and 
application 
in 
order 
to 
give 
to 
men 
the 
attention 
necessary 
for 
the 
simplest 
notions, 
and 
this 
end 
will 
only 
be 
reached 
by 
recalling 
them 
from 
their 
dissipation 
to 
themselves. 
It 
is 
also 
for 
this 
reason 
that 
the 
theologians 
who 
have 
composed 
works 
on 
eternity, 
have 
much 
need 
of 
discourse, 
of 
comparisons 
and 
of 
examples 
to 
make 
it 
well 
understood; 
although 
there 
is 
nothing 
more 
simple 
than 
the 
notion 
of 
eternity. 
But 
it 
is 
because, 
in 
such 
matters, 
all 
depends 
on 
attention. 
The 
author 
adds 
(Vol. 
I, 
p. 
301), 
that 
in 
the 
pretended 
knowledge 
of 
the 
infinite, 
the 
mind 
sees 
merely 
that 
lengths 
may 
be 
put 
end 
to 
end 
and 
repeated 
as 
many 
times 
as 
is 
wished. 
Very 
good; 
but 
this 
author 
should 
consider 
that 
to 
know 
that 
this 
repetition 
can 
always 
be 
made, 
is 
already 
to 
knowtheinfinite. 
7. 
The 
same 
author 
examines 
in 
his 
second 
volume 
the 
natural 
theology 
of 
Father 
Malebranche; 
but 
his 
performance 
appears 
to 
me 
overdone, 
although 
he 
declares 
that 
he 
merely 
presents 
the 
doubts 
of 
others. 
The 
Father 
saying 
that 
God 
is 
being 
in 
general, 
this 
is 
taken 
for 
a 
vague 
and 
notional 
being, 
as 
is 
the 
genus 
in 
logic; 
and 
little 
more 
is 
needed 
to 
accuse 
Malebranche 
of 
atheism. 
But 
I 
think 
that 
the 
Father 
understood 
not 
a 
vague 
and 
indeterminate 
being, 
but 
absolute 
being, 
which 
differs 
from 
particular 
limited 
beings 
as 
absolute 
andboundless 
spacediffers 
fromacircleorsquare. 

8. 
There 
is 
more 
likelihood 
of 
combating 
the 
opinion 
of 
Malebranche 
on 
ideas. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
necessity 
(seemingly) 
for 
taking 
them 
for 
something 
external 
to 
us. 
It 
is 
sufficient 
to 
regard 
ideas 
as 
notions, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
as 
modifications 
of 
our 
soul. 
It 
is 
thus 
that 
the 
schoolmen, 
Descartes, 
and 
Arnauld, 
regard 
them. 
But 
as 
God 
is 
the 
source 
of 
possibilities 
and 
consequently 
of 
ideas, 
the. 
Father 
may 
be 
excused 
and 
even 
praised 
for 
having 
changed 
the 
terms 
and 
given 
to 
ideas 
a 
more 
exalted 
signification, 
in 
distinguishing 
them 
from 
notions 
and 
in 
taking 
them 
for 
perfections 
in 
God 
which 
we 
participate 
in 
by 
our 
knowledge. 
This 
mystical 
language 
of 
the 
Father 
was 
not 
then 
necessary; 
but 
I 
find 
it 
useful, 
for 
it 
better 
brings 
before 
the 
mind 
our 
dependence 
on 
God. 
It 
even 
seems 
that 
Plato, 
speaking 
of 
ideas, 
and 
St. 
Augustine, 
speaking 
of 
truth, 
had 
kindred 
thoughts, 
which 
I 
find 
very 
remarkable; 
and 
this 
is 
the 
part 
of 
Malebranche’s 
system 
which 
I 
should 
like 
to 
have 
retained, 
with 
the 
phrases 
and 
formulas 
which 
depend 
on 
it, 
as 
I 
am 
very 
glad 
that 
the 
most 
solid 
part 
of 
the 
theology 
of 
the 
mystics 
is 
preserved. 
And 
far 
from 
saying 
with 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Refutation 
(Vol. 
2, 
p. 
304), 
that 
the 
system 
of 
St. 
Augustine 
is 
a 
little 
infected 
with 
the 
language 
and 
opinions 
of 
the 
Platonists; 
I 
wouldsaythatitistherebyenrichedandsetinrelief. 
9. 
I 
say 
almost 
as 
much 
of 
the 
opinion 
of 
Father 
Malebranche 
when 
he 
affirms 
that 
we 
see 
all 
things 
in 
God. 
I 
say 
that 
it 
is 
an 
expression 
which 
may 
be 
excused 
and 
even 
praised, 
provided 
it 
be 
rightly 
taken; 
for 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
fall 
into 
mistake 
in 
this 
than 
in 
the 
preceding 
article 
on 
ideas. 
It 
is, 
therefore, 
well 
to 
observe 
that 
not 
only 
in 
Malebranche’s 
system 
but 
also 
in 
mine, 
God 
alone 
is 
the 
immediate 
external 
object 
of 
souls, 
exercising 
upon 
them 
a 
real 
influence. 
And 
although 
the 
current 
school 
seems 
to 
admit 
other 
influences, 
by 
means 
of 
certain 
species, 
which 
it 
believes 
that 
objects 
convey 
into 
the 
soul,itdoes 
not 
failto 
recognize 
thatallourperfectionsareacontinualgiftof 
God, 
and 
a 
limited 
participation 
in 
his 
infinite 
perfection. 
This 
suffices 
to 

show 
that 
what 
there 
is 
true 
and 
good 
in 
our 
knowledge 
is 
still 
an 
emanation 
from 
the 
light 
of 
God, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
in 
this 
sense 
that 
it 
may 
be 
said, 
that 
we 
see 
all 
things 
in 
God. 


10. 
The 
third 
volume 
refutes 
the 
system 
of 
revealed 
theology 
of 
Father 
Malebranche, 
in 
reference 
especially 
to 
grace 
and 
predestination. 
But 
as 
I 
have 
not 
sufficiently 
studied 
the 
particular 
theological 
opinions 
of 
the 
author, 
and 
as 
I 
think 
I 
have 
sufficiently 
elucidated 
the 
matter 
in 
my 
essay 
La 
Théodicée,Iexcusemyselffrom 
enteringuponitatpresent. 
It 
would 
now 
remain 
to 
speak 
to 
you, 
sir, 
of 
the 
natural 
theology 
of 
the 
Lettres 
Chinois, 
according 
to 
what 
the 
Jesuit 
Father 
Longobardi 
and 
Father 
Antoine 
de 
St. 
Marie, 
of 
the 
Minorite 
order, 
report 
to 
us 
thereon 
in 
the 
treatises 
which 
you 
have 
sent 
me, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
my 
opinion 
of 
them; 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
mode 
which 
Reverend 
Father 
Malebranche 
has 
employed 
to 
give 
to 
a 
cultivated 
Chinaman 
some 
insight 
into 
our 
theology. 
But 
this 
requires 
a 
separate 
letter; 
this 
which 
I 
have 
just 
written 
being 
already 
sufficiently 
long.

MR. 
LEIBNITZ’SFIRST 
PAPER:BeinganExtractofaLetterwritten 
in 
November,1715. 



1. 
NATURAL 
RELIGION 
itself 
seems 
to 
decay 
[in 
England] 
very 
much. 
Many 
will 
have 
human 
souls 
to 
be 
material: 
others 
make 
God 
himself 
a 
corporeal 
Being. 
2. 
Mr. 
Locke, 
and 
his 
followers, 
are 
uncertain 
at 
least, 
whether 
the 
soul 
be 
not 
material,andnaturallyperishable. 
3. 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton 
says, 
that 
space 
is 
an 
organ, 
which 
God 
makes 
use 
of 
to 
perceive 
things 
by. 
But 
if 
God 
stands 
in 
need 
of 
any 
organ 
to 
perceive 
things 
by, 
it 
will 
follow, 
that 
they 
do 
not 
depend 
altogether 
upon 
him, 
nor 
wereproducedby 
him. 
4. 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton, 
and 
his 
followers, 
have 
also 
a 
very 
odd 
opinion 
concerning 
the 
work 
of 
God. 
According 
to 
their 
doctrine, 
God 
Almighty 
wants 
to 
wind 
up 
his 
watch 
from 
time 
to 
time: 
otherwise 
it 
would 
cease 
to 
move. 
Hehadnot,it 
seems,sufficientforesighttomakeitaperpetual 
motion. 
Nay, 
the 
machine 
of 
God’s 
making, 
is 
so 
imperfect, 
according 
to 
these 
gentlemen; 
that 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
clean 
it 
now 
and 
then 
by 
an 
extraordinary 
concourse, 
and 
even 
to 
mend 
it, 
as 
a 
clockmaker 
mends 
his 
work; 
who 
must 
consequently 
be 
so 
much 
the 
more 
unskillful 
a 
workman, 
as 
he 
is 
oftener 
obliged 
to 
mend 
his 
work 
and 
to 
set 
it 
right. 
According 
to 
my 
opinion, 
the 
same 
force 
and 
vigor 
remains 
always 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
only 
passes 
from 
one 
part 
of 
matter 
to 
another, 
agreeably 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
beautiful 
pre-established 
order. 
AndI 
hold, 
that 
when 
God 
works 
miracles, 
he 
does 
not 
do 
it 
in 
order 
to 
supply 
the 
wants 
of 
nature, 
but 
those 
of 
grace. 
Whoever 

thinks 
otherwise, 
must 
needs 
have 
a 
very 
mean 
notion 
of 
the 
wisdom 
and 
power 
ofGod. 



MR. 
LEIBNITZ’S 
SECOND 
PAPER: 
BEING 
AN 
ANSWER 


TO 
DR. 
CLARKE’S 


FirstReply. 



1. 
IT 
IS 
rightly 
observed 
in 
the 
paper 
delivered 
to 
the 
Princess 
of 
Wales, 
whichherRoyalHighnesshasbeenpleasedtocommunicate 
tome,that,next 
to 
corruption 
of 
manners, 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
materialists 
do 
very 
much 
contribute 
to 
keep 
up 
impiety. 
But 
I 
believe 
the 
author 
had 
no 
reason 
to 
add, 
that 
the 
mathematical 
principles 
of 
philosophy 
are 
opposite 
to 
those 
of 
the 
materialists. 
Onthecontrary,theyarethesame;onlywiththisdifference,that 
the 
materialists, 
in 
imitation 
of 
Democritus, 
Epicurus, 
and 
Holies, 
confine 
themselves 
altogether 
to 
mathematical 
principles, 
and 
admit 
only 
bodies; 
whereas 
the 
Christian 
mathematicians 
admit 
also 
immaterial 
substances. 
Wherefore, 
not 
mathematical 
principles 
(according 
to 
the 
usual 
sense 
of 
that 
word) 
but 
metaphysical 
principles 
ought 
to 
be 
opposed 
to 
those 
of 
the 
materialists. 
Pythagoras, 
Plato, 
and 
Aristotle 
in 
some 
measure, 
had 
a 
knowledge 
of 
these 
principles; 
but 
I 
pretend 
to 
have 
established 
them 
demonstratively 
in 
my 
Theodicaea, 
though 
I 
have 
done 
it 
in 
a 
popular 
manner. 
The 
great 
foundation 
of 
mathematics, 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction 
or 
identity, 
that 
is, 
that 
a 
proposition 
cannot 
he 
true 
and 
false 
at 
the 
same 
time; 
and 
that 
therefore 
A 
is 
A, 
and 
cannot 
be 
not 
A. 
This 
single 
principle 
is 
sufficient 
to 
demonstrate 
every 
part 
of 
arithmetic 
and 
geometry, 
that 
is, 
all 
mathematical 
principles. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
proceed 
from 
mathematics 
to 
natural 
philosophy, 
another 
principle 
is 
requisite, 
as 
I 
have 
observed 
in 
my 
Theodicaea: 
I 
mean, 
the 
principle 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason, 
vis: 
that 
nothing 
happens 
without 
a 
reason 
why 
it 
should 
he 
so, 
rather 
than 
otherwise. 
And 

therefore 
Archimedes 
being 
desirous 
to 
proceed 
from 
mathematics 
to 
natural 
philosophy, 
in 
his 
book 
De 
Æquililrio, 
was 
obliged 
to 
make 
use 
of 
a 
particular 
case 
of 
the 
great 
principle 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason. 
He 
takes 
it 
for 
granted, 
that 
if 
there 
he 
a 
balance, 
in 
which 
every 
thing 
is 
alike 
on 
both 
sides, 
and 
if 
equal 
weights 
are 
hung 
on 
the 
two 
ends 
of 
that 
balance, 
the 
whole 
will 
be 
at 
rest. 
’Tis 
because 
no 
reason 
can 
be 
given, 
why 
one 
side 
should 
weigh 
down, 
rather 
than 
the 
other. 
Now, 
by 
that 
single 
principle, 
vis: 
that 
there 
ought, 
to 
le 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
why 
things 
should 
le 
so, 
and 
not 
otherwise, 
one 
may 
demonstrate 
the 
being 
of 
a 
God, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
metaphysics 
or 
natural 
theology; 
and 
even, 
in 
some 
measure, 
those 
principles 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
that 
are 
independent 
upon 
mathematics: 
I 
mean, 
the 
dynamic 
principles,orthe 
principles 
of 
force. 


2. 
The 
author 
proceeds 
and 
says, 
that 
according 
to 
the 
mathematical 
principles, 
that 
is, 
according 
to 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton’s 
philosophy 
(for 
mathematical 
principles 
determine 
nothing 
in 
the 
present 
case,) 
matter 
is 
the 
most 
inconsiderable 
part 
of 
the 
universe. 
The 
reason 
is, 
because 
he 
admits 
empty 
space, 
besides 
matter; 
and 
because, 
according 
to 
his 
notions, 
matter 
fills 
up 
only 
a 
very 
small 
part 
of 
space. 
But 
Democritus 
and 
Epicurus 
maintained 
the 
same 
thing: 
they 
differed 
from 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton, 
only 
as 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
matter; 
and 
perhaps 
they 
believed 
there 
was 
more 
matter 
in 
the 
world, 
than 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton 
will 
allow: 
wherein 
I 
think 
their 
opinion 
ought 
to 
be 
preferred; 
for, 
the 
more 
matter 
there 
is, 
the 
more 
God 
has 
occasion 
to 
exercise 
his 
wisdom 
and 
power. 
Which 
is 
one 
reason, 
among 
others,whyImaintain 
that,thereis 
no 
vacuum 
atall. 
3. 
I 
find, 
in 
express 
words, 
in 
the 
Appendix 
to 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton’s 
Optics, 
that 
space 
is 
the 
sensorium 
of 
God. 
But 
the 
word 
sensorium 
hath 
always 
signified 
the 
organ 
of 
sensation. 
He, 
and 
his 
friends, 
may 
now, 
if 
they 
think 
fit,explainthemselvesquiteotherwise: 
Ishall 
not 
beagainstit. 

4. 
The 
author 
supposes 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
soul 
is 
sufficient, 
to 
make 
it 
perceive 
what 
passes 
in 
the 
brain. 
But 
this 
is 
the 
very 
thing 
which 
Father 
Malebranche, 
and 
all 
the 
Cartesians 
deny; 
and 
they 
rightly 
deny 
it. 
More 
is 
requisitebesides 
barepresence,toenableonethingtoperceivewhatpasses 
in 
another. 
Some 
communication, 
that 
may 
be 
explained; 
some 
sort 
of 
influence, 
is 
requisite 
for 
this 
purpose. 
Space, 
according 
to 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton, 
is 
intimately 
present 
to 
the 
body 
contained 
in 
it, 
and 
commensurate 
with 
it. 
Does 
it 
follow 
from 
thence, 
that 
space 
perceives 
what 
passes 
in 
a 
body; 
and 
remembers 
it, 
when 
that 
body 
is 
gone 
away? 
Besides, 
the 
soul 
being 
indivisible, 
it’s 
immediate 
presence, 
which 
may 
be 
imagined 
in 
the 
body, 
would 
only 
be 
in 
one 
point. 
How 
then 
could 
it 
perceive 
what 
happens 
out 
of 
that 
point? 
I 
pretend 
to 
be 
the 
first, 
who 
has 
shown 
how 
the 
soul 
perceives 
whatpasses 
inthebody. 
5. 
The 
reason 
why 
God 
perceives 
every 
thing, 
is 
not 
his 
bare 
presence, 
but 
also 
his 
operation. 
’Tis 
because 
he 
preserves 
things 
by 
an 
action, 
which 
continually 
produces 
whatever 
is 
good 
and 
perfect 
in 
them. 
But 
the 
soul 
having 
no 
immediate 
influence 
over 
the 
body, 
nor 
the 
body 
over 
the 
soul, 
their 
mutual 
correspondence 
cannot 
he 
explained 
by 
their 
being 
present 
to 
eachother. 
6. 
The 
true 
and 
principal 
reason 
why 
we 
commend 
a 
machine, 
is 
rather 
grounded 
upon 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
machine, 
than 
upon 
its 
cause. 
We 
don’t 
enquire 
so 
much 
about 
the 
power 
of 
the 
artist, 
as 
we 
do 
about 
his 
skill 
in 
his 
workmanship. 
And 
therefore 
the 
reason 
alleged 
by 
the 
author 
for 
extolling 
the 
machine 
of 
God’s 
making, 
grounded 
upon 
his 
having 
made 
it 
entirely, 
without 
wanting 
any 
materials 
to 
make 
it 
of; 
that 
reason, 
I 
say, 
is 
not 
sufficient. 
’Tis 
a 
mere 
shift 
the 
author 
has 
been 
forced 
to 
have 
recourse 
to: 
and 
the 
reason 
why 
God 
exceeds 
any 
other 
artist, 
is 
not 
only 
because 
he 
makes 
the 
whole, 
whereas 
all 
other 
artists 
must 
have 
matter 
to 
work 
upon. 

This 
excellency 
in 
God, 
would 
be 
only 
on 
the 
account 
of 
power. 
But 
God’s 
excellency 
arises 
also 
from 
another 
cause, 
viz: 
wisdom, 
whereby 
his 
machine 
lasts 
longer, 
and 
moves 
more 
regularly, 
than 
those 
of 
any 
other 
artist 
whatsoever. 


He 
who 
buys 
a 
watch, 
does 
not 
mind 
whether 
the 
workman 
made 
every 
part 
of 
it 
himself, 
or 
whether 
he 
got 
the 
several 
parts 
made 
by 
others, 
and 
did 
only 
put 
them 
together; 
provided 
the 
watch 
goes 
right. 
And 
if 
the 
workman 
had 
received 
from 
God 
even 
the 
gift 
of 
creating 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
wheels; 
yet 
the 
buyer 
of 
the 
watch 
would 
not 
be 
satisfied, 
unless 
the 
workman 
had 
also 
receivedthegiftof 
putting 
them 
well 
together. 
In 
like 
manner, 
he 
who 
will 
be 
pleased 
with 
God’s 
workmanship, 
cannot 
be 
so, 
without 
some 
other 
reason 
thanthatwhich 
theauthorhasherealleged. 


7. 
Thus 
the 
skill 
of 
God 
must 
not 
be 
inferior 
to 
that 
of 
a 
workman; 
nay, 
it 
must 
go 
infinitely 
beyond 
it. 
The 
bare 
production 
of 
every 
thing, 
would 
indeed 
show 
the 
power 
of 
God; 
but 
it 
would 
not 
sufficiently 
show 
his 
wisdom. 
Theywhomaintainthecontrary,willfallexactlyinto 
theerrorofthe 
materialists, 
and 
of 
Spinoza, 
from 
whom 
they 
profess 
to 
differ. 
They 
would, 
in 
such 
case, 
acknowledge 
power, 
but 
not 
sufficient 
wisdom, 
in 
the 
principle 
orcauseofall 
things. 
8. 
I 
do 
not 
say, 
the 
material 
world 
is 
a 
machine, 
or 
watch, 
that 
goes 
without 
God’s 
interposition; 
and 
I 
have 
sufficiently 
insisted, 
that 
the 
creation 
wants 
tobecontinually 
influencedby 
its 
Creator. 
But 
I 
maintain 
it 
to 
be 
a 
watch, 
that 
goes 
without 
wanting 
to 
be 
mended 
by 
him: 
otherwise 
we 
must 
say, 
that 
God 
bethinks 
himself 
again. 
No; 
God 
has 
foreseen 
everything; 
he 
has 
provided 
a 
remedy 
for 
everything 
before-hand; 
thereis 
inhisworks 
aharmony,abeauty,already 
pre-established. 


9. 
This 
opinion 
does 
not 
exclude 
God’s 
Providence, 
or 
his 
government 
of 
the 
world: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
makes 
it 
perfect. 
A 
true 
Providence 
of 
God, 

requires 
a 
perfect 
foresight. 
But 
then 
it 
requires 
moreover, 
not 
only 
that 
he 
should 
have 
foreseen 
everything; 
but 
also 
that 
he 
should 
have 
provided 
for 
everything 
beforehand, 
with 
proper 
remedies: 
otherwise, 
he 
must 
want 
either 
wisdom 
to 
foresee 
things, 
or 
power 
to 
provide 
against 
them. 
He 
will 
be 
like 
the 
God 
of 
the 
Socinians, 
who 
lives 
only 
from 
dap 
to 
day, 
as 
Mr. 
Jurieu 
says. 
Indeed 
God, 
according 
to 
the 
Socinians, 
does 
not 
so 
much 
as 
foresee 
inconveniences; 
whereas, 
the 
gentlemen 
I 
am 
arguing 
with, 
who 
put 
him 
upon 
mending 
his 
work, 
say 
only, 
that 
he 
does 
not 
provide 
against 
them. 
But 
this 
seems 
to 
me 
to 
be 
still 
a 
very 
great 
imperfection. 
According 
to 
this 
doctrine,Godmust 
wanteither 
power, 
or 
good 
will. 


10. 
I 
don’t 
think 
I 
can 
be 
rightly 
blamed, 
for 
saying 
that 
God 
is 
intelligentia 
supramundana. 
Will 
they 
say, 
that 
he 
is 
intelligentia 
mundana; 
that 
is, 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
world? 
I 
hope 
not. 
However, 
they 
will 
do 
well 
to 
take 
carenotto 
fallintothatnotionunawares. 
11. 
The 
comparison 
of 
a 
king, 
under 
whose 
reign 
everything 
should 
go 
on 
without 
his 
interposition, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
to 
the 
present 
purpose; 
since 
God 
preserves 
everything 
continually, 
and 
nothing 
can 
subsist 
without 
him. 
His 
kingdom 
therefore 
is 
not 
a 
nominal 
one. 
’Tis 
just 
as 
if 
one 
should 
say, 
that 
a 
king, 
who 
should 
originally 
have 
taken 
care 
to 
have 
his 
subjects 
so 
well 
educated, 
and 
should, 
by 
his 
care 
in 
providing 
for 
their 
subsistence, 
preserve 
them 
so 
well 
in 
their 
fitness 
for 
their 
several 
stations, 
and 
in 
their 
good 
affection 
towards 
him, 
as 
that 
he 
should 
have 
no 
occasion 
ever 
to 
be 
amendinganything 
amongstthem;would 
beonlya 
nominal 
king. 
12. 
To 
conclude. 
If 
God 
is 
obliged 
to 
mend 
the 
course 
of 
nature 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
it 
must 
be 
done 
either 
super 
naturally 
or 
naturally. 
If 
it 
be 
done 
supernaturally, 
wemust 
have 
recourseto 
miracles, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
natural 
things: 
which 
is 
reducing 
an 
hypothesis 
ad 
absurdum: 
for, 
everything 
may 
easily 
beaccounted 
for 
by 
miracles. 
But 
if 
it 
be 
done 
naturally, 
then 
God 
will 

not 
be 
intelligentia 
supramundama: 
be 
will 
be 
comprehended 
under 
the 
natureofthings;thatis, 
hewillbe 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
world. 


MR. 
LEIBNITZ’STHIRDPAPER:Beingan 
Answer 
toDr. 
Clarke’s 


Second 
Reply. 


1. 
According 
to 
the 
usual 
way 
of 
speaking, 
mathematical 
principles 
concern 
only 
mere 
mathematics, 
viz: 
numbers, 
figures, 
arithmetic, 
geometry. 
But 
metaphysical 
principles 
concern 
more 
general 
notions, 
such 
as 
are 
cause 
and 
effect. 
2. 
The 
author 
grants 
me 
this 
important 
principle; 
that 
nothing 
happens 
without 
a 
sufficient 
reason, 
why 
it 
should 
he 
so, 
rather 
than 
otherwise. 
But 
he 
grants 
it 
only 
in 
words, 
and 
in 
reality 
denies 
it. 
Which 
shows 
that 
he 
does 
not 
fully 
perceive 
the 
strength 
of 
it. 
And 
therefore 
he 
makes 
use 
of 
an 
influence, 
which 
exactly 
falls 
in 
with 
one 
of 
my 
demonstrations 
against 
real 
absolute 
space, 
which 
is 
an 
idol 
of 
some 
modern 
Englishmen. 
I 
call 
it 
an 
idol, 
not 
in 
a 
theological 
sense, 
but 
in 
a 
philosophical 
one; 
as 
Chancellor 
Bacon 
says, 
that 
thereare 
idola 
tribus, 
idola 
specus. 
3. 
These 
gentlemen 
maintain 
therefore, 
that 
space 
is 
a 
real 
absolute 
being. 
But 
this 
involves 
them 
in 
great 
difficulties; 
for 
such 
a 
being 
must 
needs 
be 
eternal 
and 
infinite. 
Hence 
some 
have 
believed 
it 
to 
be 
God 
himself, 
or, 
one 
of 
his 
attributes, 
his 
immensity. 
But 
since 
space 
consists 
of 
parts, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
thingwhich 
canbelongtoGod. 
4. 
As 
for 
my 
own 
opinion, 
I 
have 
said 
more 
than 
once, 
that 
I 
hold 
space 
to 
be 
something 
merely 
relative, 
as 
time 
is; 
that 
I 
hold 
it 
to 
be 
an 
order 
of 
coexistences, 
as 
time 
is 
an 
order 
of 
successions. 
For 
space 
denotes, 
in 
terms 
of 
possibility, 
an 
order 
of 
things 
which 
exist 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
considered 
as 
existing 
together; 
without 
inquiring 
into 
their 
particular 
manner 
of 
existing. 

And 
when 
many 
things 
are 
seen 
together, 
one 
perceives 
that 
order 
of 
things 
among 
themselves. 


5. 
I 
have 
many 
demonstrations, 
to 
confute 
the 
fancy 
of 
those 
who 
take 
space 
to 
be 
a 
substance, 
or 
at 
least 
an 
absolute’ 
being. 
But 
I 
shall 
only 
use, 
at 
the 
present, 
one 
demonstration, 
which 
the 
author 
here 
gives 
me 
occasion 
to 
insist 
upon. 
I 
say 
then, 
that 
if 
space 
was 
an 
absolute 
being, 
there 
would 
something 
happen, 
for 
which 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
there 
should 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason. 


Which 
is 
against 
my 
Axiom. 
And 
I 
prove 
it 
thus. 
Space 
is 
something 
absolutely 
uniform; 
and, 
without 
the 
things 
placed 
in 
it, 
one 
point 
of 
space 
does 
not 
absolutely 
differ 
in 
any 
respect 
whatsoever 
from 
another 
point 
of 
space. 
Now 
from 
hence 
it 
follows, 
(supposing 
space 
to 
be 
something 
in 
itself, 
besides 
the 
order 
of 
bodies 
among 
themselves,) 
that 
’tis 
impossible 
there 
should 
be 
a 
reason, 
why 
God, 
preserving 
the 
same 
situations 
of 
bodies 
among 
themselves, 
should 
have 
placed 
them 
in 
space 
after 
one 
certain 
particular 
manner, 
and 
not 
otherwise; 
why 
everything 
was 
not 
placed 
the 
quite 
contrary 
way, 
for 
instance, 
by 
changing 
east 
into 
west. 
But 
if 
space 
is 
nothing 
else, 
but 
that 
order 
or 
relation; 
and 
is 
nothing 
at 
all 
without 
bodies, 
but 
the 
possibility 
of 
placing 
them; 
then 
those 
two 
states, 
the 
one 
such 
as 
it 
now 
is, 
the 
other 
supposed 
to 
be 
the 
quite 
contrary 
way, 
would 
not 
at 
all 
differ 
from 
one 
another. 
Their 
difference 
therefore 
is 
only 
to 
be 
found 
in 
our 
chimerical 
supposition 
of 
the 
reality 
of 
space 
in 
itself. 
But 
in 
truth 
the 
one 
would 
exactly 
be 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
the 
other, 
they 
being 
absolutely 
indiscernible; 
and 
consequently 
there 
is 
no 
room 
to 
enquire 
after 
a 
reason 
of 
thepreferenceof 
the 
oneto 
the 
other. 


6. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
with 
respect 
to 
time. 
Supposing 
any 
one 
should 
ask, 
why 
God 
did 
not 
create 
everything 
a 
year 
sooner; 
and 
the 
same 
person 
should 
infer 
fromthence,thatGodhasdonesomething, 
concerningwhich 
’tis 

not 
possible 
there 
should 
be 
a 
reason, 
why 
he 
did 
it 
so, 
and 
not 
otherwise: 
the 
answer 
is, 
that 
his 
inference 
would 
be 
right, 
if 
time 
was 
any 
thing 
distinct 
from 
things 
existing 
in 
time. 
For 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
there 
should 
be 
any 
reason, 
why 
thingsshouldbe 
applied 
to 
such 
particular 
instants, 
rather 
than 
to 
others, 
their 
succession 
continuing 
the 
same. 
But 
then 
the 
same 
argument 
proves, 
that 
instants, 
considered 
without 
the 
things, 
are 
nothing 
at 
all; 
and 
that 
they 
consist 
only 
in 
the 
successive 
order 
of 
things: 
which 
order 
remaining 
the 
same, 
one 
of 
the 
two 
states, 
viz. 
that 
of 
a 
supposed 
anticipation, 
would 
not 
at 
all 
differ, 
nor 
could 
be 
discerned 
from, 
the 
other 
which 
nowis. 


7. 
It 
appears 
from 
what 
I 
have 
said, 
that 
my 
axiom 
has 
not 
been 
well 
understood; 
and 
that 
the 
author 
denies 
it, 
tho’ 
he 
seems 
to 
grant 
it.’ 
Tis 
true, 
says 
he, 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 
without 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
why 
it 
is, 
and 
why 
it 
is 
thus, 
rather 
than 
otherwise: 
but 
he 
adds, 
that 
this 
sufficient 
reason, 
is 
often 
the 
simple 
or 
mere 
will 
of 
God: 
as, 
when 
it 
is 
asked 
why 
matter 
was 
not 
placed 
otherwise 
in 
space; 
the 
same 
situations 
of 
bodies 
among 
themselves 
being 
preserved. 
But 
this 
is 
plainly 
maintaining, 
that 
God 
wills 
something, 
without 
any 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
his 
will: 
against 
the 
axiom, 
or 
the 
general 
rule 
of 
whatever 
happens. 
This 
is 
falling 
back 
into 
the 
loose 
indifference, 
which 
I 
have 
confuted 
at 
large, 
and 
showed 
to 
be 
absolutely 
chimerical 
even 
in 
creatures, 
and 
contrary 
to 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God, 
as 
if 
he 
could 
operate 
withoutacting 
byreason. 
8. 
The 
author 
objects 
against 
me, 
that 
if 
we 
don’t 
admit 
this 
simple 
and 
mere 
will, 
we 
take 
away 
from 
God 
the 
power 
of 
choosing, 
and 
bring 
in 
a 
fatality. 
But 
the 
quite 
contrary 
is 
true. 
I 
maintain 
that 
God 
has 
the 
power 
of 
choosing, 
since 
I 
ground 
that 
power 
upon 
the 
reason 
of 
a 
choice 
agreeable 
to 
his 
wisdom. 
And 
’tis 
not 
this 
fatality, 
(which 
is 
only 
the 
wisest 
order 
of 

Providence) 
but 
a 
blind 
fatality 
or 
necessity, 
void 
of 
all 
wisdom 
and 
choice, 
which 
we 
oughttoavoid. 


9. 
I 
had 
observed, 
that 
by 
lessening 
the 
quantity 
of 
matter, 
the 
quantity 
of 
objects, 
upon 
which 
God 
may 
exercise 
his 
goodness, 
will 
be 
lessen’d. 
The 
author 
answers, 
that 
instead 
of 
matter, 
there 
are 
other 
things 
in 
the 
void 
space, 
on 
which 
God 
may 
exercise 
his 
goodness. 
Be 
it 
so: 
tho’ 
I 
don’t 
grant 
it; 
for 
I 
hold 
that 
every 
created 
substance 
is 
attended 
with 
matter. 
However, 
let 
it 
be 
so: 
I 
answer, 
that 
more 
matter 
was 
consistent 
with 
those 
same 
things; 
and 
consequently 
the 
said 
objects 
will 
be 
still 
lessened. 
The 
instance 
of 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
men, 
or 
animals, 
is 
not 
to 
the 
purpose; 
for 
they 
would 
fill 
up 
place,in 
exclusionofotherthings. 
10. 
It 
will 
be 
difficult 
to 
make 
me 
believe, 
that 
sensorium 
does 
not, 
in 
its 
usual 
meaning,signifyan 
organ 
of 
sensation. 
11. 
The 
mere 
presence 
of 
a 
substance, 
even 
an 
animated 
one, 
is 
not 
sufficient 
for 
perception. 
A 
blind 
man, 
and 
even 
a 
man 
whose 
thoughts 
are 
wandering, 
does 
not 
see. 
The 
author 
must 
explain, 
how 
the 
soul 
perceives 
whatis 
without 
itself. 
12. 
God 
is 
not 
present 
to 
things 
by 
situation, 
but 
by 
essence: 
his 
presence 
is 
manifestedbyhisimmediate 
operation. 
The 
presence 
of 
the 
soul 
is 
quite 
of 
another 
nature. 
To 
say 
that 
it 
is 
diffused 
all 
over 
the 
body, 
is 
to 
make 
it 
extended 
and 
divisible. 
To 
say 
it 
is, 
the 
whole 
of 
it, 
in 
every 
part 
of 
the 
body, 
is 
to 
make 
it 
divided 
from 
itself. 
To 
fix 
it 
to 
a 
point, 
to 
diffuse 
it 
all 
over 
many 
points, 
are 
onlyabusiveexpressions, 
idola 
tribus. 
13. 
If 
active 
force 
should 
diminish 
in 
the 
universe, 
by 
the 
natural 
laws 
which 
God 
has 
established; 
sothatthere 
should 
beneed 
forhimtogive 
a 
new 
impression 
in 
order 
to 
restore 
that 
force, 
like 
an 
artist’s 
mending 
the 
imperfections 
of 
his 
machine; 
the 
disorder 
would 
not 
only 
be 
with 
respect 
to 
us, 
but 
also 
with 
respect 
to 
God 
himself. 
He 
might 
have 
prevented 
it, 
and 

taken 
better 
measures 
to 
avoid 
such 
an 
inconvenience: 
and 
therefore, 
indeed, 
hehas 
actually 
doneit. 


14. 
When 
I 
said 
that 
God 
has 
provided 
remedies 
beforehand 
against 
such 
disorders, 
I 
did 
not 
say 
that 
God 
suffers 
disorders 
to 
happen, 
and 
then 
finds 
remedies 
for 
them; 
but 
that 
he 
has 
found 
a 
way 
beforehand 
to 
prevent 
any 
disordershappening. 
15. 
The 
author 
strives 
in 
vain 
to 
criticize 
my 
expression, 
that 
God 
is 
intelligentia 
supramundana. 
To 
say 
that 
God 
is 
above 
the 
world, 
is 
not 
denyingthathe 
isin 
the 
world. 
16. 
I 
never 
gave 
any 
occasion 
to 
doubt, 
but 
that 
God’s 
conservation 
is 
an 
actual 
preservation 
and 
continuation 
of 
the 
beings, 
powers, 
orders, 
dispositions, 
and 
motions 
of 
all 
things: 
and 
I 
think 
I 
have 
perhaps 
explained 
it 
better 
than 
many 
others. 
But, 
says 
the 
author, 
this 
is 
all 
that 
I 
contended 
for. 
To 
this 
I 
answer; 
your 
humble 
servant 
for 
that, 
sir. 
Our 
dispute 
consists 
in 
many 
other 
things. 
The 
question 
is, 
whether 
God 
does 
not 
act 
in 
the 
most 
regular 
and 
most 
perfect 
manner? 
whether 
his 
machine 
is 
liable 
to 
disorder, 
which 
he 
is 
obliged 
to 
mend 
by 
extraordinary 
means? 
whether 
the 
will 
of 
God 
can 
act 
without 
reason? 
whether 
space 
is 
an 
absolute 
being? 
also 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
miracles; 
and 
many 
such 
things, 
which 
make 
a 
wide 
difference 
betweenus. 
17. 
Divines 
will 
not 
grant 
the 
author’s 
position 
against 
me, 
viz. 
that 
there 
is 
no 
difference, 
with 
respect 
to 
God, 
between 
natural 
and 
supernatural: 
and 
it 
will 
be 
still 
less 
approved 
by 
most 
philosophers. 
There 
is 
a 
vast 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
things; 
but 
it 
plainly 
appears, 
it 
has 
not 
been 
duly 
consider’d. 
That 
which 
is 
supernatural 
exceeds 
all 
the 
powers 
of 
creatures. 
I 
shall 
give 
an 
instance, 
which 
I 
have 
often 
made 
use 
of 
with 
good 
success. 
If 
God 
would 
cause 
a 
body 
to 
move 
free 
in 
the 
aether 
round 
about 
a 
certain 
fixed 
center, 
without 
any 
other 
creature 
acting 
upon 
it: 
I 
say, 
it 
could 
not 
be 

done 
without 
a 
miracle; 
since 
it 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
nature 
of 
bodies. 
For, 
a

MR. 
LEIBNITZ’SFOURTH 
PAPER; 
BEING 
AN 
ANSWER 


TO 
DR. 
CLARKE’S 


Third 
Reply. 



1. 
IN 
THINGS 
absolutely 
indifferent, 
there 
is 
no 
[foundation 
for] 
choice; 
and 
consequently 
no 
election, 
nor 
will; 
since 
choice 
must 
he 
founded 
on 
some 
reason, 
orprinciple. 
2. 
A 
mere 
wid 
without 
any 
motive, 
is 
a 
fiction, 
not 
only 
contrary 
to 
God’s 
perfection, 
but 
also 
chimerical 
and 
contradictory; 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
definitionofthe 
will,andsufficientlyconfutedinmy 
Theodicaea. 
3. 
’Tis 
a 
thing 
indifferent, 
to 
place 
three 
bodies, 
equal 
and 
perfectly 
alike, 
in 
any 
order 
whatsoever; 
and 
consequently 
they 
will 
never 
be 
placed 
in 
any 
order, 
by 
him 
who 
does 
nothing 
without 
wisdom. 
But 
then, 
he 
being 
the 
author 
of 
things, 
no 
such 
things 
will 
be 
produced 
by 
him 
at 
all; 
and 
consequently 
there 
are 
no 
such 
things 
innature. 
4. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
two 
individuals 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other. 
An 
ingenious 
gentleman 
of 
my 
acquaintance, 
discoursing 
with 
me, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
her 
Electoral 
Highness 
the 
Princess 
Sophia, 
in 
the 
garden 
of 
Herrenhausen, 
thought 
he 
could 
find 
two 
leaves 
perfectly 
alike. 
The 
princess 
defied 
him 
to 
do 
it, 
and 
he 
ran 
all 
over 
the 
garden 
a 
long 
time 
to 
look 
for 
some; 
but 
it 
was 
to 
no 
purpose. 
Two 
drops 
of 
water, 
or 
milk, 
viewed 
with 
a 
microscope, 
will 
appear 
distinguishablefrom, 
each 
other. 
This 
is 
an 
argument 
against 
atoms; 
which 
are 
confuted, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
vacuum, 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
truemetaphysics. 
5. 
Those 
great 
principles 
of’ 
a 
sufficient 
reason, 
and 
of 
the 
identity 
of 
indiscernibles, 
change 
the 
state 
of 
metaphysics. 
That 
science 
becomes 
real 

and 
demonstrative 
by 
means 
of 
these 
principles; 
whereas 
before, 
it 
did 
generallyconsistinemptywords. 


6. 
To 
suppose 
two 
things 
indiscernible, 
is 
to 
suppose 
the 
same 
thing 
under 
two 
names. 
And 
therefore 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
universe 
could 
have 
had 
at 
first 
another 
position 
of 
time 
and 
place, 
than 
that 
which 
it 
actually 
had; 
and 
yet 
that 
all 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
universe 
should 
have 
had 
the 
same 
situation 
among 
themselves, 
as 
that 
which 
they 
actually 
had; 
such 
a 
supposition, 
I 
say, 
is 
an 
impossible 
fiction. 
7. 
The 
same 
reason, 
which 
shows 
that 
extramundane 
space 
is 
imaginary, 
proves 
that 
all 
empty 
space 
is 
an 
imaginary 
thing; 
for 
they 
differ 
only 
as 
greaterand 
less. 
8. 
If 
space 
is 
a 
property 
or 
attribute, 
it 
must 
be 
the 
property 
of 
some 
substance. 
But 
what 
substance 
will 
that 
bounded 
empty 
space 
he 
an 
affection 
or 
property 
of, 
which 
the 
persons 
I 
am 
arguing 
with, 
suppose 
to 
be 
between 
two 
bodies? 
9. 
If 
infinite 
space 
is 
immensity, 
finite 
space 
will 
be 
the 
opposite 
to 
immensity, 
that 
is, 
‘twill 
be 
mensurability, 
or 
limited 
extension. 
Now 
extension 
must 
be 
the 
affection 
of 
some 
thing 
extended. 
But 
if 
that 
space 
be 
empty, 
it 
will 
be 
an 
attribute 
without 
a 
subject, 
an 
extension 
without 
any 
thing 
extended. 
Wherefore 
by 
making 
space 
a 
property, 
the 
author 
falls 
in 
with 
my 
opinion, 
which 
makes 
it 
an 
order 
of 
things, 
and 
not 
any 
thing 
absolute. 
10. 
If 
space 
is 
an 
absolute 
reality; 
far 
from 
being 
a 
property 
or 
an 
accident 
opposed 
to 
substance, 
it 
will 
have 
a 
greater 
reality 
than 
substances 
themselves. 
God 
cannot 
destroy 
it, 
nor 
even 
change 
it 
in 
any 
respect. 
It 
will 
be 
not 
only 
immense 
in 
the 
whole, 
but 
also 
immutable 
and 
eternal 
in 
every 
part. 
Therewillbeaninfinitenumberof 
eternal 
things 
besides 
God. 

11. 
To 
say 
that 
infinite 
space 
has 
no 
parts, 
is 
to 
say 
that 
it 
does 
not 
consist 
of 
finite 
spaces; 
and 
that 
infinite 
space 
might 
subsist, 
though 
all 
finite 
space 
should 
be 
reduced 
to 
nothing. 
It 
would 
be, 
as 
if 
one 
should 
say, 
in 
the 
Cartesian 
supposition 
of 
a 
material 
extended 
unlimited 
world, 
that 
such 
a 
world 
might 
subsist, 
though 
all 
the 
bodies 
of 
which 
it 
consists, 
should 
be 
reducedtonothing. 
12. 
The 
author 
ascribes 
parts 
to 
space, 
p. 
19 
of 
the 
3d 
edition 
of 
his 
Defense 
of 
the 
Argument 
against 
Mr. 
Dodwell; 
and 
makes 
them 
inseparable 
one 
from 
another. 
But, 
p. 
30 
of 
his 
Second 
Defense, 
he 
says 
they 
are 
parts 
improperly 
so-called: 
whichmaybe 
understoodin 
agood 
sense. 
13. 
To 
say 
that 
God 
can 
cause 
the 
whole 
universe 
to 
move 
forward 
in 
a 
right 
line, 
or 
in 
any 
other 
line, 
without 
making 
otherwise 
any 
alteration 
in 
it, 
is 
another 
chimerical 
supposition. 
For, 
two 
states 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other, 
are 
the 
same 
state; 
and 
consequently, 
’tis 
a 
change 
without 
any 
change. 
Besides, 
there 
is 
neither 
rhyme 
nor 
reason 
in 
it. 
But 
God 
does 
nothing 
without 
reason; 
and 
’tis 
impossible 
there 
should 
he 
any 
here. 
Besides, 
it 
would 
be 
agendo 
nihil 
agere, 
as 
I 
have 
just 
now 
said, 
because 
of 
the 
indiscernibility. 
14. 
These 
are 
idola 
tribus, 
mere 
chimeras, 
and 
superficial 
imaginations. 
Allthis 
isonly 
groundeduponthesupposition, 
thatImaginaryspaceisreal. 
15. 
It 
is 
a 
like 
fiction, 
(that 
is) 
an 
impossible 
one, 
to 
suppose 
that 
God 
might 
have 
created 
the 
world 
some 
millions 
of 
years 
sooner. 
They 
who 
run 
into 
such 
kind 
of 
fictions, 
can 
give 
no 
answer 
to 
one 
that 
should 
argue 
for 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
world. 
For 
since 
God 
does 
nothing 
without 
reason, 
and 
no 
reason 
can 
be 
given 
why 
he 
did 
not 
create 
the 
world 
sooner; 
it 
will 
follow, 
either 
that 
he 
has 
created 
nothing 
at 
all, 
or 
that 
he 
created 
the 
world 
before 
any 
assignable 
time, 
that 
is, 
that 
the 
world 
is 
eternal. 
But 
when 
once, 
it 
has 
been 
shown, 
that 
the 
beginning, 
whenever 
it 
was, 
is 
always 
the 
same 
thing; 

the 
question, 
why 
it 
was 
not 
otherwise 
ordered, 
becomes 
needless 
and 
insignificant. 


16. 
If 
space 
and 
time 
were 
anything 
absolute, 
that 
is, 
if 
they 
were 
anything 
else, 
besides 
certain 
orders 
of 
things; 
then 
indeed 
my 
assertion 
would 
be 
a 
contradiction. 
But 
since 
it 
is 
not 
so, 
the 
hypothesis 
[that 
space 
and 
time 
are 
anything 
absolute]iscontradictory,that 
is, 
’tisan 
impossible 
fiction. 
17. 
And 
the 
case 
is 
the 
same 
as 
in 
geometry; 
where 
by 
the 
very 
supposition 
thatafigure 
is 
greater 
than 
itreally 
is, 
we 
sometimes 
provethat 
it 
is 
not 
greater. 
This 
indeed 
is 
a 
contradiction; 
but 
it 
lies 
in 
the 
hypothesis, 
which 
appears 
tobefalseforthatveryreason. 
18. 
Space 
being 
uniform, 
there 
can 
be 
neither 
any 
external 
nor 
internal 
reason, 
by 
which 
to 
distinguish 
its 
parts, 
and 
to 
make 
any 
choice 
among 
them. 
For, 
any 
external 
reason 
to 
discern 
between 
them, 
can 
only 
be 
grounded 
upon 
some 
internal 
one. 
Otherwise 
we 
should 
discern 
what 
is 
indiscernible, 
or 
choose’ 
without 
discerning. 
A 
will 
without 
reason, 
would 
be 
the 
chance 
of 
the 
Epicureans. 
A 
God, 
who 
should 
act 
by 
such 
a 
will, 
would 
be 
a 
God 
only 
in 
name. 
The 
cause 
of 
these 
errors 
proceeds 
from 
want 
of 
care 
toavoidwhatderogatesfrom 
thedivineperfections. 
19. 
When 
two 
things 
which 
cannot 
both 
be 
together, 
are 
equally 
good; 
and 
neither 
in 
themselves, 
nor 
by 
their 
combination 
with 
other 
things, 
has 
the 
one 
any 
advantage 
overthe 
other;Godwillproduce 
neither 
of 
them. 
20. 
God 
is 
never 
determined 
by 
external 
things, 
but 
always 
by 
what 
is 
in 
himself; 
that 
is, 
by 
his 
knowledge 
of 
things, 
before 
any 
thing 
exists 
without 
himself. 
21. 
There 
is 
no 
possible 
reason, 
that 
can 
limit 
the 
quantity 
of 
matter; 
and 
thereforesuchlimitationcanhavenoplace. 
22. 
And 
supposing 
an 
arbitrary 
limitation 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
matter, 
something 
might 
always 
be 
added 
to 
it 
without 
derogating 
from 
the 

perfection 
of 
those 
things 
which 
do 
already 
exist; 
and 
consequently 
something 
must 
always 
be 
added, 
in 
order 
to 
act 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
theperfection 
ofthedivineoperations. 


23. 
And 
therefore 
it 
cannot 
be 
said, 
that 
the 
present 
quantity 
of 
matter 
is 
the 
fittest 
for 
the 
present 
constitution 
of 
things. 
And 
supposing 
it 
were, 
it 
would 
follow 
that 
this 
present 
constitution 
of 
things 
would 
not 
be 
the 
fittest 
absolutely, 
if 
it 
hinders 
God 
from 
using 
more 
matter. 
It 
were 
therefore 
better 
tochooseanother 
constitutionofthings,capableofsomethingmore. 
21. 
I 
should 
be 
glad 
to 
see 
a 
passage 
of 
any 
philosopher, 
who 
takes 
sensorium 
inanyothersensethan 
Goclenius 
does. 
25. 
If 
Scapula 
says 
that 
sensorium 
is 
the 
place 
in 
which 
the 
understanding 
resides, 
he 
means 
by 
it 
the 
organ 
of 
internal 
sensation. 
And 
therefore 
he 
does 
notdiffer 
fromGoclenius. 
26. 
Sensorium 
has 
always 
signified 
the 
organ, 
of 
sensation. 
The 
glandula 
penealis 
would 
be, 
according 
to 
Cartesius, 
the 
sensorium, 
in 
the 
above-
mentioned 
sense 
of 
Scapula. 
27. 
There 
is 
hardly 
any 
expression 
less 
proper 
upon 
this 
subject, 
than 
that 
which 
makes 
God 
to 
have 
a 
sensorium. 
It 
seems 
to 
make 
God 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
world. 
And 
it 
will 
be 
a 
hard 
matter 
to 
put 
a 
justifiable 
sense 
upon 
this 
word, 
accordingtotheuseSir 
Isaac 
Newton 
makesofit. 
28. 
Though 
the 
question 
be 
about 
the 
sense 
put 
upon 
that 
word 
by 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton, 
and 
not 
by 
Goclenius; 
yet 
I 
am 
not 
to 
blame 
for 
quoting 
the 
philosophical 
dictionary 
of 
that 
author, 
because 
the 
design 
of 
dictionaries 
is 
toshow 
theuseof 
words. 
29. 
God 
perceives 
things 
in 
himself. 
Space 
is 
the 
place 
of 
things, 
and 
not 
the 
place 
of 
God’s 
ideas: 
unless 
we 
look 
upon 
space 
as 
something 
that 
makes 
anunionbetween 
Godandthings,inimitation 
oftheimaginedunionbetween 
thesoulandthebody;which 
wouldstillmake 
Godthe 
soul 
of 
the 
world. 

30. 
And 
indeed 
the 
author 
is 
much 
in 
the 
wrong, 
when 
he 
compares 
God’s 
knowledge 
and 
operation, 
with 
the 
knowledge 
and 
operation 
of 
souls. 
The 
soul 
knows 
things, 
because 
God 
has 
put 
into 
it 
a 
principle 
representative 
of 
things 
without. 
But 
God 
knowsthings,because 
he 
produces 
themcontinually. 
31. 
The 
soul 
does 
not 
act 
upon 
things, 
according 
to 
my 
opinion, 
any 
otherwise 
than 
because 
the 
body 
adapts 
itself 
to 
the 
desires 
of 
the 
soul, 
by 
virtue 
ofthe 
harmony, 
whichGodhas 
pre-established 
betweenthem. 
32. 
But 
they 
who 
fancy 
that 
the 
soul 
can 
give 
a 
new 
force 
to 
the 
body; 
and 
that 
God 
does 
the 
same 
in 
the 
world, 
in 
order 
to 
mend 
the 
imperfections 
of 
his 
machine; 
make 
God 
too 
much 
like 
the 
soul, 
by 
ascribing 
too 
much 
to 
the 
soul,and 
toolittletoGod. 
33. 
For, 
none 
but 
God 
can 
give 
a 
new 
force 
to 
nature; 
and 
he 
does 
it 
only 
supernaturally. 
If 
there 
was 
need 
for 
him 
to 
do 
it 
in 
the 
natural 
course 
of 
things; 
he 
would 
have 
made 
a 
very 
imperfect 
work. 
At 
that 
rate, 
he 
would 
be 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
world, 
what 
the 
soul, 
in 
the 
vulgar 
notion, 
is 
with 
respect 
tothebody. 
34. 
Those 
who 
undertake 
to 
defend 
the 
vulgar 
opinion 
concerning 
the 
soul’s 
influence 
over 
the 
body, 
by 
instancing 
in 
God’s 
operating 
on 
things 
external; 
make 
God 
still 
too 
much 
like 
a 
soul 
of 
the 
world. 
To 
which 
I 
add, 
that 
the 
author’s 
affecting 
to 
find 
fault 
with 
the 
words, 
intelligentia 
supramundana, 
seemsalso 
toinclinethatway. 
35. 
The 
images, 
with 
which 
the 
soul 
is 
immediately 
affected, 
are 
within 
itself; 
but 
they 
correspond 
to 
those 
of 
the 
body. 
The 
presence 
of 
the 
soul 
is 
imperfect, 
and 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
by 
that 
correspondence. 
But 
the 
presenceof 
Godis 
perfect,and 
manifestedbyhisoperation. 
36. 
The 
author 
wrongly 
supposes 
against 
me, 
that 
the 
presence 
Of 
the 
soul 
is 
connected 
with 
its 
influence 
over 
the 
body; 
for 
he 
knows, 
I 
reject 
that 
influence. 

37. 
The 
soul’s 
being 
diffused 
through 
the 
brain, 
is 
no 
less 
inexplicable, 
than 
its 
being 
diffused 
through 
the 
whole 
body. 
The 
difference 
is 
only 
in 
more 
and 
less. 
38. 
They 
who 
fancy 
that 
active 
force 
lessens 
of 
itself 
in 
the 
world, 
do 
not 
well 
understand 
the 
principal 
laws 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
works 
of 
God. 
39. 
How 
will 
they 
he 
able 
to 
prove, 
that 
this 
defect 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
dependenceofthings? 
40. 
The 
imperfection 
of 
our 
machines, 
which 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
they 
want 
to 
be 
mended, 
proceeds 
from 
this 
very 
thing, 
that 
they 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
depend 
upon 
the 
workman. 
And 
therefore 
the 
dependence 
of 
nature 
upon 
God, 
far 
from 
being 
the 
cause 
of 
such 
an 
imperfection, 
is 
rather 
the 
reason 
why 
there 
is 
no 
such 
imperfection 
in 
nature, 
because 
it 
depends 
so 
much 
upon 
an 
artist, 
who 
is 
too 
perfect 
to 
make 
a 
work 
that 
wants 
to 
be 
mended. 
’Tis 
true 
that 
every 
particular 
machine 
of 
nature, 
is, 
in 
some 
measure, 
liable 
to 
be 
disordered; 
but 
not 
the 
whole 
universe, 
which 
cannot 
diminish 
in 
perfection. 
41. 
The 
author 
contends, 
that 
space 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
the 
situation 
of 
bodies. 
I 
answer: 
’Tis 
true, 
it 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
such 
or 
such 
a 
situation 
of 
bodies; 
but 
it 
is 
that 
order, 
which 
renders 
bodies 
capable 
of 
being 
situated, 
and 
by 
which 
they 
have 
a 
situation 
among 
themselves 
when 
they 
exist 
together; 
as 
time 
is 
that 
order, 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
successive 
position. 
But 
if 
therewerenocreatures, 
spaceandtimewouldbeonly 
intheideasofGod. 
42. 
The 
author 
seems 
to 
acknowledge 
here, 
that 
his 
notion 
of 
a 
miracle 
is 
not 
the 
same 
with 
that 
which 
divines 
and 
philosophers 
usually 
have. 
It 
is 
therefore 
sufficient 
for 
my 
purpose, 
that 
my 
adversaries 
are 
obliged 
to 
have 
recoursetowhatis 
commonly 
called 
a 
miracle. 

43. 
I 
am 
afraid 
the 
author, 
by 
altering 
the 
sense 
commonly 
put 
upon 
the 
word 
miracle, 
will 
fall 
into 
an 
inconvenient 
opinion. 
The 
nature 
of 
a 
miracle 
does 
not 
at 
all 
consist 
in 
usefulness 
or 
unusefulness; 
for 
then 
monsters 
would 
be 
miracles. 
“. 
There 
are 
miracles 
ofan 
inferior 
sort, 
which 
an 
angel 
can 
work. 
He 
can, 
for 
instance, 
make 
a 
man 
walk 
upon 
the 
water 
without 
sinking. 
But 
there 
are 
miracles, 
which 
none 
but 
God 
can 
work; 
they 
exceeding 
all 
natural 
powers. 
Ofwhich 
kind,are 
creating 
and 
annihilating. 


45. 
’Tis 
also 
a 
supernatural 
thing, 
that 
bodies 
should 
attract 
one 
another 
at 
a 
distance, 
without 
any 
intermediate 
means; 
and 
that 
a 
body 
should 
move 
around, 
without 
receding 
in 
the 
tangent, 
though 
nothing 
hinder 
it 
from 
so 
receding. 
Fortheseeffects

46. 
Why 
should 
it 
be 
impossible 
to 
explain 
the 
motion 
of 
animals 
by 
natural 
forces? 
Though 
indeed, 
the

of

is 
no

P. 
S. 
— 
All 
those 
who 
maintain 
a 
vacuum, 
are 
more 
influenced 
by 
imagination 
than 
by 
reason. 
When 
I 
was 
a 
young 
man, 
I 
also 
gave 
in 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
vacuum 
and 
atoms; 
but 
reason 
brought 
me 
into 
the 
right 
way. 
It 
was 
a 
pleasing 
imagination. 
Men 
carry 
their 
inquiries 
no 
farther 
than 
those 
two 
things: 
they 
(as 
it 
were) 
nail 
down 
their 
thoughts 
to 
them: 
they 
fancy, 
they 
have 
found 
out 
the 
first 
elements 
of 
things, 
a 
non 
plus 
ultra. 
We 
would 
have 
nature 
to 
go 
no 
farther; 
and 
to 
be 
finite, 
as 
our 
minds 
are: 
but 
this 
is 
being 
ignorant 
of 
the 
greatness 
and 
majesty 
of 
the 
author 
of 
things. 
The 
least 
corpuscle 
is 
actually 
subdivided 
in 
infinitum, 
and 
contains, 
a 
world 
of 
other 
creatures, 
which 
would 
be 
wanting 
in 
the 
universe, 
if 
that 
corpuscle 
was 
an 
atom, 
that 
is, 
a 
body 
of 
one 
entire 
piece 
without 
subdivision. 
In 
like 
manner, 
to 
admit 
a 
vacuum 
in 
nature, 
is 
ascribing 
to 
God 
a 
very 
imperfect 
work: 
’tis 
violating 
the 
grand 
principle 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason; 
which 

many 
have 
talked 
of, 
without 
understanding 
its 
true 
meaning; 
as 
I 
have 
lately 
shown, 
in 
proving, 
by 
that 
principle, 
that 
space 
is 
only 
an 
order 
of 
things, 
as 
time 
also 
is, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
an 
absolute 
being. 
To 
omit 
many 
other 
arguments 
against 
a 
vacuum 
and 
atoms, 
I 
shall 
here 
mention 
those 
which 
I 
ground 
upon 
God’s 
perfection, 
and 
upon 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason. 
I 
lay 
it 
down 
as 
a 
principle, 
that 
every 
perfection, 
which 
God 
could 
impart 
to 
things 
without, 
derogating 
from 
their 
other 
perfections, 
has 
actually 
been 
imparted 
to 
them. 
Now, 
let 
us 
fancy 
a 
space 
wholly 
empty. 
God 
could 
have 
placed 
some 
matter 
in 
it, 
without 
derogating 
in 
any 
respect 
from 
all 
other 
things: 
therefore 
he 
hath 
actually 
placed 
some 
matter 
in 
that 
space: 
therefore, 
there 
is 
no 
space 
wholly 
empty: 
therefore 
all 
is 
full. 
The 
same 
argument 
proves 
that 
there 
is 
no 
corpuscle, 
but 
what 
is 
subdivided. 
I 
shall 
add 
another 
argument, 
grounded 
upon 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason. 
’Tis 
impossible 
there 
should 
be 
any 
principle 
to 
determine 
what 
proportion 
of 
matter 
there 
ought 
to 
be, 
out 
of 
all 
the 
possible 
degrees 
from 
a 
plenum 
to 
a 
vacuum, 
or 
from 
a 
vacuum 
to 
a 
plenum. 
Perhaps 
it 
will 
be 
said, 
that 
the 
one 
should 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
other: 
but, 
because 
matter 
is 
more 
perfect 
than 
a 
vacuum, 
reason 
requires 
that 
a 
geometrical 
proportion 
should 
be 
observed, 
and 
that 
there 
should 
be 
as 
much 
more 
matter 
than 
vacuum, 
as 
the 
former 
deserves 
to 
have 
the 
preference 
before 
the 
latter. 
But 
then 
there 
must 
be 
no 
vacuum 
at 
all; 
for 
the 
perfection 
of 
matter 
is 
to 
that 
of 
a 
vacuum, 
as 
something 
to 
nothing. 
And 
the 
case 
is 
the 
same 
with 
atoms: 
What 
reason 
can 
any 
one 
assign 
for 
confining 
nature 
in 
the 
progression 
of 
subdivision? 
These 
are 
fictions 
merely 
arbitrary, 
and 
unworthy 
of 
true 
philosophy. 
The 
reasons 
alleged 
for 
a 
vacuum, 
are 
mere 
sophisms. 



MR. 
LEIBNITZ’S 
FIFTHPAPER: 
BEING 
AN 
ANSWERTO 


DR. 
CLARKE’S 


FourthReply. 



TO§ 
1 
and2,oftheforegoingpaper[Clarke’sFourthReply.] 


1. 
I 
shall 
at 
this 
time 
make 
a 
larger 
answer; 
to 
clear 
the 
difficulties; 
and 
to 
try 
whether 
the 
author 
be 
willing 
to 
hearken 
to 
reason, 
and 
to 
show 
that 
he 
is 
a 
loveroftruth;or 
whetherhewillonlycavil, 
without 
clearinganything. 
2. 
He 
often 
endeavors 
to 
impute 
to 
me 
necessity 
and 
fatality; 
though 
perhaps 
no 
one 
has 
better 
and 
more 
fully 
explained, 
than 
I 
have 
done 
in 
my 
Theodicaea, 
the 
true 
difference 
between 
liberty, 
contingency, 
spontaneity, 
on 
the 
one 
side; 
and 
absolute 
necessity, 
chance, 
coaction, 
on 
the 
other. 
I 
know 
not 
yet, 
whether 
the 
author 
does 
this, 
because 
he 
will 
do 
it, 
whatever 
I 
may 
say; 
or 
whether 
he 
does 
it, 
(supposing 
him 
sincere 
in 
those 
imputations,) 
because 
he 
has 
not 
yet 
duly 
considered 
my 
opinions. 
I 
shall 
soon 
find 
what 
I 
amtothinkofit, 
andIshalltake 
my 
measuresaccordingly. 
3. 
It 
is 
true, 
that 
reason 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
a 
wise 
being, 
and 
motives 
in 
any 
mind 
whatsoever, 
do 
that 
which 
answers 
to 
the 
effect 
produced 
by 
weights 
in 
a 
balance. 
The 
author 
objects, 
that 
this 
notion 
leads 
to 
necessity 
and 
fatality. 
But 
he 
says 
so, 
without 
proving 
it, 
and 
without 
taking 
notice 
of 
the 
explications 
I 
have 
formerly 
given, 
in 
order 
to 
remove 
the 
difficulties 
that 
maybe 
raiseduponthathead. 
4. 
He 
seems 
also 
to 
play 
with 
equivocal 
terms. 
There 
are 
necessities, 
which 
ought 
tobeadmitted. 
For 
we 
mustdistinguishbetweenan 
absolute 
and 
an 
hypothetical 
necessity. 
We 
must 
also 
distinguish 
between 
a 
necessity, 

which 
takes 
place 
because 
the 
opposite 
implies 
a 
contradiction; 
(which 
necessity 
is 
called 
logical, 
metaphysical, 
or 
mathematical;) 
and 
a 
necessity 
which 
is 
moral, 
whereby 
a 
wise 
being 
chooses 
the 
best, 
and 
every 
mind 
followsthestrongestinclination. 


5. 
Hypothetical 
necessity 
is 
that, 
which 
the 
supposition 
or 
hypothesis 
of 
God’s 
foresight 
and 
pre-ordination 
lays 
upon 
future 
contingents. 
And 
this 
must 
needs 
be 
admitted, 
unless 
we 
deny, 
as 
the 
Socinians 
do, 
God’s 
foreknowledge 
of 
future 
contingents, 
and 
his 
providence 
which 
regulates 
and 
governsevery 
particular 
thing. 
6. 
But 
neither 
that 
foreknowledge, 
nor 
that 
pre-ordination, 
derogate 
from 
liberty. 
For 
God, 
being 
moved 
by 
his 
supreme 
reason 
to 
choose, 
among 
many 
series 
of 
things 
or 
worlds 
possible, 
that, 
in 
which 
free 
creatures 
should 
take 
such 
or 
such 
resolutions, 
though 
not 
without 
his 
concourse; 
has 
thereby 
rendered 
every 
event 
certain 
and 
determined 
once 
for 
all; 
without 
derogating 
thereby 
from 
the 
liberty 
of 
those 
creatures: 
that 
simple 
decree 
of 
choice, 
not 
at 
all 
changing, 
but 
only 
actualizing 
their 
free 
natures, 
which 
he 
saw 
in 
his 
ideas. 
7. 
As 
for 
moral 
necessity, 
this 
also 
does 
not 
derogate 
from 
liberty. 
For 
when 
a 
wise 
being, 
and 
especially 
God, 
who 
has 
supreme 
wisdom, 
chooses 
what 
is 
best, 
he 
is 
not 
the 
less 
free 
upon 
that 
account: 
on 
the 
contrary, 
it 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
liberty, 
not 
to 
be 
hindered, 
from 
acting 
in 
the 
best 
manner. 
And 
when 
any 
other 
chooses 
according 
to 
the 
most 
apparent 
and 
the 
most 
strongly 
inclining 
good,, 
he 
imitates 
therein 
the 
liberty 
of 
a 
truly 
wise 
being, 
in 
proportion 
to 
his 
disposition. 
Without 
this, 
the 
choice 
would 
be 
a 
blind 
chance. 
8. 
Butgood,eithertrueor 
apparent;inaword,themotive, 
inclineswithout 
necessitating; 
that 
is, 
without 
imposing 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
For 
when 
God 
(for 
instance,) 
chooses 
the 
best; 
what 
he 
does 
not 
choose, 
and 
is 
inferior 
in 

perfection, 
is 
nevertheless 
possible. 
But 
if 
what 
he 
chooses, 
was 
absolutely 
necessary; 
any 
other 
way 
would 
be 
impossible: 
which 
is 
against 
the 
hypothesis. 
For 
God 
chooses 
among 
possibles, 
that 
is, 
among 
many 
ways, 
noneof 
whichimpliesacontradiction. 


9. 
But 
to 
say, 
that 
God 
can 
only 
choose 
what 
is 
best; 
and 
to 
infer 
from 
thence, 
that 
what 
he 
does 
not 
choose, 
is 
impossible; 
this, 
I 
say, 
is 
confounding 
of 
terms: 
’tis 
blending 
power 
and 
will, 
metaphysical 
necessity 
and 
moral 
necessity, 
essences 
and 
existences. 
For 
what 
is 
necessary, 
is 
so 
by 
its 
essence, 
since 
the 
opposite 
implies 
a 
contradiction; 
but 
a 
contingent 
which 
exists, 
owes 
its 
existence 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
what 
is 
best, 
which 
is 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
things. 
And 
therefore 
I 
say, 
that 
motives 
incline 
without 
necessitating; 
and 
that 
there 
is 
a 
certainty 
and 
infallibility, 
but 
not 
an 
absolute 
necessity 
in 
contingent 
things. 
Add 
to 
this, 
what 
will 
be 
said 
hereafter, 
Nos. 
73 
and 
76. 
10. 
And 
I 
have 
sufficiently 
shown 
in 
my 
Theodicaea, 
that 
this 
moral 
necessity 
is 
a 
good 
thing, 
agreeable 
to 
the 
divine 
perfection 
agreeable 
to 
the 
great 
principle 
or 
ground 
of 
existences, 
which 
is 
that 
of 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficientreason:whereas 
absoluteandmetaphysical 
necessity,dependsupon 
the 
other 
great 
principle 
of 
our 
reasonings, 
vis. 
that 
of 
essences; 
that 
is, 
the 
principle 
of 
identity 
or 
contradiction: 
for 
what 
is 
absolutely 
necessary, 
is 
the 
onlypossibleway,and 
itscontraryimpliesacontradiction. 
11. 
I 
have 
also 
shown, 
that 
our 
will 
does 
not 
always 
exactly 
follow 
the 
practical 
understanding; 
because 
it 
may 
have 
or 
find 
reasons 
to 
suspend 
its 
resolutiontilla 
furtherexamination. 
12. 
To 
impute 
to 
me 
after 
this, 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
absolute 
necessity, 
without 
havinganythingtosayagainstthe 
reasons 
whichIhavejustnowalleged,and 
which 
go 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
things, 
perhaps 
beyond 
what 
is 
to 
be 
seen 
elsewhere;this,Isay,willbeanunreasonableobstinacy. 

13. 
As 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
fatality, 
which 
the 
author 
lays 
also 
to 
my 
charge; 
this 
is 
another 
ambiguity. 
There 
is 
a 
fatum 
Mahometanum, 
a 
fatum 
stoicum, 
and 
&c 
fatum 
Christianum. 
The 
Turkish 
fate 
will 
have 
an 
effect 
to 
happen, 
even 
though 
its 
cause 
should 
be 
avoided; 
as 
if 
there 
was 
an 
absolute 
necessity. 
The 
Stoical 
fate 
will 
have 
a 
man 
to 
be 
quiet, 
because 
he 
must 
have 
patience 
whether 
he 
will 
or 
not, 
since 
’tis 
impossible 
to 
resist 
the 
course 
of 
things. 
But 
’tis 
agreed, 
that 
there 
is 
fatum 
Christianum, 
a 
certain 
destiny 
of 
everything,regulatedbytheforeknowledgeandprovidenceof 
God. 
Fatum 
is 
derived 
from 
fari; 
that 
is 
to 
pronounce, 
to 
decree; 
and 
in 
its 
right 
sense, 
it 
signifies 
the 
decree 
of 
providence. 
And 
those 
who 
submit 
to 
it 
through 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
divine 
perfections, 
whereof 
the 
love 
of 
God 
is 
a 
consequence; 
have 
not 
only 
patience, 
like 
the 
heathen 
philosophers, 
but 
are 
also 
contented 
with 
what 
is 
ordained 
by 
God, 
knowing 
he 
does 
every 
thing 
for 
the 
best; 
and 
not 
only 
for 
the 
greatest 
good 
in 
general, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
greatestparticular 
goodofthosewho 
lovehim. 
14. 
I 
have 
been 
obliged 
to 
enlarge, 
in 
order 
to 
remove 
ill-grounded 
imputations 
once 
for 
all; 
as 
I 
hope 
I 
shall 
he 
able 
to 
do 
by 
these 
explications, 
so 
as 
to 
satisfy 
equitable 
persons. 
I 
shall 
now 
come 
to 
an 
objection 
raised 
here, 
against 
my 
comparing 
the 
weights 
of 
a 
balance 
with 
the 
motives 
of 
the 
will. 
’Tis 
objected, 
that 
a 
balance 
is 
merely 
passive, 
and 
moved 
by 
the 
weights; 
whereas 
agents 
intelligent, 
and 
endowed 
with 
will, 
are 
active. 
To 
this 
I 
answer, 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
is 
common 
both 
to 
agents 
and 
patients: 
they 
want 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
of 
their 
action, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
their 
passion. 
A 
balance 
does 
not 
only 
not 
act, 
when 
it 
is 
equally 
pulled 
on 
both 
sides; 
but 
the 
equal 
weights 
likewise 
do 
not 
act 
when 
they 
are 
in 
an 
equilibrium, 
so 
that 
one 
of 
them 
cannot 
go 
down 
without 
the 
other’s 
risingupasmuch. 

15. 
It 
must 
also 
he 
considered, 
that, 
properly 
speaking, 
motives 
do 
not 
act 
upon 
the 
mind, 
as 
weights 
do 
upon 
a 
balance; 
but 
’tis 
rather 
the 
mind 
that 
acts 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
motives, 
which 
are 
its 
dispositions 
to 
act. 
And 
therefore 
to 
pretend, 
as 
the 
author 
does 
here, 
that 
the 
mind 
prefers 
sometimes 
weak 
motives 
to 
strong 
ones, 
and 
even 
that 
it 
prefers 
that 
which 
is 
indifferent 
before 
motives: 
this, 
I 
say, 
is 
to 
divide 
the 
mind 
from 
the 
motives, 
as 
if 
they 
were 
without 
the 
mind, 
as 
the 
weight 
is 
distinct 
fromthe 
balance; 
and 
as 
if 
the 
mind 
had, 
besides 
motives, 
other 
dispositions 
to 
act, 
by 
virtue 
of 
which 
it 
could 
reject 
or 
accept 
the 
motives. 
Whereas, 
in 
truth, 
the 
motives 
comprehend 
all 
the 
dispositions, 
which 
the 
mind 
can 
have 
to 
act 
voluntarily; 
for 
they 
include 
not 
only 
the 
reasons, 
but 
also 
the 
inclinations 
arising 
from 
passions, 
or 
other 
preceding 
impressions. 
Wherefore, 
if 
the 
mind 
should 
prefer 
a 
weak 
inclination 
to 
a 
strong 
one, 
it 
would 
act 
against 
itself, 
and 
otherwise 
than 
it 
is 
disposed 
to 
act. 
Which 
shows 
that 
the 
author’s 
notions, 
contrary 
to 
mine, 
are 
superficial, 
and 
appear 
to 
have 
no 
solidity 
in 
them, 
when 
they 
are 
well 
considered. 
16. 
To 
assert 
also, 
that 
the 
mind 
may 
home 
good 
reasons 
to 
act, 
when 
it 
has 
no 
motives, 
and 
when 
things 
are 
absolutely 
indifferent, 
as 
the 
author 
explains 
himself 
here; 
this, 
I 
say, 
is 
a 
manifest 
contradiction. 
For 
if 
the 
mind 
has 
good 
reasons 
for 
taking 
the 
part 
it 
takes, 
then 
the 
things 
are 
not 
indifferent 
tothemind. 
17. 
And 
to 
affirm 
that 
the 
mind 
will 
act, 
when 
it 
has 
reasons 
to 
act, 
even 
though 
the 
ways 
of 
acting 
were 
absolutely 
indifferent: 
this, 
I 
say, 
is 
to 
speak 
again 
very 
superficially, 
and 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
cannot 
he 
defended. 
For 
a 
man 
never 
has 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
to 
act, 
when 
he 
has 
not 
also 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
to 
act 
in 
a 
certain 
particular 
manner; 
every 
action 
being 
individual, 
and 
not 
general, 
nor 
abstract 
from 
its 
circumstances, 
but 
always 
needing 
some 
particular 
way 
of 
being 
put 
in 
execution. 
Wherefore, 
when 
there 
is 
a 

sufficient 
reason 
to 
do 
any 
particular 
thing, 
there 
is 
also 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
to 
do 
it 
in 
a 
certain 
particular 
manner; 
and 
consequently, 
several 
manners 
of 
doing 
it 
are 
not 
indifferent. 
As 
often 
as 
a 
man 
has 
sufficient 
reasons 
for 
a 
single 
action,he 
has 
alsosufficientreasonsforallitsrequisites. 
Seealsowhat 
Ishallsaybelow,No. 
66. 


18. 
These 
arguments 
are 
very 
obvious: 
and 
’tis 
very 
strange 
to 
charge 
me 
with 
advancing 
my 
principle 
of 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason, 
without 
any 
proof 
drawn 
either 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
or 
from 
the 
divine 
perfections. 
For 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
requires, 
that 
every 
event 
should 
have 
beforehand 
its 
proper 
conditions, 
requisites, 
and 
dispositions, 
the 
existence 
whereof 
makes 
thesufficientreasonof 
suchevent. 
19. 
And 
God’s 
perfection 
requires, 
that 
all 
his 
actions 
should 
be 
agreeable 
to 
his 
wisdom; 
and 
that 
it 
may 
not 
be 
said 
of 
him, 
that 
he 
has 
acted 
without 
reason;oreven 
thathehaspreferredaweakerreasonbeforea 
stronger. 
20. 
But 
I 
shall 
speak 
more 
largely 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
this 
paper, 
concerning 
the 
solidity 
and 
importance 
of 
this 
great 
principle, 
of 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
in 
order 
to 
every 
event; 
the 
overthrowing 
of 
which 
principle, 
would 
overthrow 
the 
best 
part 
of 
all 
philosophy. 
’Tis 
therefore 
very 
strange 
that 
the 
author 
should 
say, 
I 
am 
herein 
guilty 
of 
a 
petitio 
principii; 
and 
it 
plainly 
appears 
he 
is 
desirous 
to 
maintain 
indefensible 
opinions, 
since 
he 
is 
reduced 
to 
deny 
that 
great 
principle, 
which 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
essential 
principlesofreason. 
To§3and 
4. 


21. 
It 
must 
be 
confessed, 
that 
though 
this 
great 
principle 
has 
been 
acknowledged, 
yet 
it 
has 
not 
been 
sufficiently 
made 
use 
of. 
Which 
is, 
in 
great 
measure, 
the 
reason 
why 
the 
prima 
philosophia 
has 
not 
been 
hitherto 
so 
fruitful 
and 
demonstrative, 
as 
it 
should 
have 
been. 
I 
infer 
from 
that 
principle, 

among 
other 
consequences, 
that 
there 
are 
not 
in 
nature 
two 
real, 
absolute 
beings, 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other; 
because 
if 
there 
were, 
God 
and 
nature 
would 
act 
without 
reason, 
in 
ordering 
the 
one 
otherwise 
than 
the 
other; 
and 
that 
therefore 
God 
does 
not 
produce 
two 
pieces 
of 
matter 
perfectly 
equal 
and 
alike. 
The 
author 
answers 
this 
conclusion, 
without 
confuting 
the 
reason 
of 
it; 
and 
he 
answers 
with 
a 
very 
weak 
objection. 
That 
argument, 
says 
he, 
if 
it 
was 
good, 
would 
prove 
that 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
God 
to 
create 
any 
matter 
at 
all. 
For, 
the 
perfectly 
solid 
parts 
of 
matter, 
if 
we 
take 
them 
of 
equal 
figure 
and 
dimensions, 
(which 
is 
always 
possible 
in 
supposition), 
would, 
be 
exactly 
alike. 
But 
’tis 
a 
manifest 
petitio 
principii 
to 
suppose 
that 
perfect 
likeness, 
which, 
according 
to 
me, 
cannot 
be 
admitted. 
This 
supposition 
of 
two 
indiscernibles, 
such 
as 
two 
pieces 
of 
matter 
perfectly 
alike, 
seems 
indeed 
to 
be 
possible 
in 
abstract 
terms; 
but 
it 
is 
not 
consistent 
with 
the 
order 
of 
things, 
nor 
with 
the 
divine 
wisdom, 
by 
which 
nothing 
is 
admitted 
without 
reason. 
The 
vulgar 
fancy 
such 
things, 
because 
they 
content 
themselves 
with 
incompletenotions. 
Andthisis 
oneof 
the 
faultsof 
the 
atomists. 


22. 
Besides; 
I 
don’t 
admit 
in 
matter, 
parts 
perfectly 
solid, 
or 
that 
are 
the 
same 
throughout, 
without 
any 
variety 
or 
particular 
motion 
in 
their 
parts, 
as 
the 
pretended 
atoms 
are 
imagined 
to 
be. 
To 
suppose 
such 
bodies, 
is 
another 
popular 
opinion 
ill-grounded. 
According 
to 
my 
demonstrations, 
every 
part 
of 
matteris 
actually 
subdividedintopartsdifferently 
moved, 
and 
no 
one 
of 
them 
is 
perfectly 
like 
another. 
23. 
I 
said, 
that 
in 
sensible 
things, 
two, 
that 
are 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other, 
can 
never 
be 
found; 
that 
(for 
instance) 
two 
leaves 
in 
a 
garden, 
or 
two 
drops 
of 
water, 
perfectly 
alike, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
found. 
The 
author 
acknowledges 
it 
as 
to 
leaves, 
and 
perhaps 
as 
to 
drops 
of 
water. 
But 
he 
might 
have 
admitted 
it, 
without 
any 
hesitation, 
without 
a 
perhaps, 
(an 
Italian 
would 
say, 
senza 
forse,) 
asto 
drops 
ofwaterlikewise. 

24. 
I 
believe 
that 
these 
general 
observations 
in 
things 
sensible 
hold 
also 
in 
proportion 
in 
things 
insensible, 
and 
that 
one 
may 
say, 
in 
this 
respect, 
what 
harlequin 
says 
in 
the 
Emperor 
of 
the 
Moon; 
His 
there, 
just 
as 
’tis 
here. 
And 
’tis 
a 
great 
objection 
against 
indiscernables, 
that 
no 
instance 
of 
them 
is 
to 
be 
found. 
But 
the 
author 
opposes 
this 
consequence, 
because 
(says 
he) 
sensible 
bodies 
are 
compounded; 
whereas 
he 
maintains 
there 
are 
insensible 
bodies 
which 
are 
simple. 
I 
answer 
again 
that 
I 
don’t 
admit 
simple 
bodies. 
There 
is 
nothing 
simple, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
but 
true 
monads, 
which 
have 
neither 
parts 
nor 
extension. 
Simple 
bodies, 
and 
even 
perfectly 
similar 
ones, 
are 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
false 
hypothesis 
of 
a 
vacuum 
and 
of 
atoms, 
or 
of 
lazy 
philosophy, 
which 
does 
not 
sufficiently 
carry 
on 
the 
analysis 
of 
things, 
and 
fancies 
it 
can 
attain 
to 
the 
first 
material 
elements 
of 
nature, 
because 
our 
imagination 
would 
betherewithsatisfied. 
25. 
When 
I 
deny 
that 
there 
are 
two 
drops 
of 
water 
perfectly 
alike, 
or 
any 
two 
other 
bodies 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other; 
I 
don’t 
say, 
’tis 
absolutely 
impossible 
to 
suppose 
them; 
but 
that 
‘tie 
a 
thing 
contrary 
to 
the 
divine 
wisdom, 
andwhich 
consequentlydoes 
not 
exist. 
To§5and 
6. 


26. 
I 
own, 
that 
if 
two 
things 
perfectly 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other 
did 
exist, 
they 
would 
be 
two; 
but 
that 
supposition 
is 
false, 
and 
contrary 
to 
the 
grand 
principle 
of 
reason. 
The 
vulgar 
philosophers 
were 
mistaken, 
when 
they 
believed 
that 
there 
are 
things 
different 
solo 
numero, 
or 
only 
because 
they 
are 
two; 
and 
from 
this 
error 
have 
arisen 
their 
perplexities 
about 
what 
they 
called 
the 
principle 
of 
individuation. 
Metaphysics 
have 
generally 
been 
handled 
like 
a 
science 
ofmere 
words, 
like 
aphilosophicaldictionary,withoutenteringinto 
the 
discussion 
of 
things. 
Superficial 
philosophy, 
such 
as 
is 
that 
of 
the 
atomists 
and 
vacuists, 
forges 
things, 
which 
superior 
reasons 
do 
not 
admit. 
I 

hope 
my 
demonstrations 
will 
change 
the 
face 
of 
philosophy, 
notwithstanding 
suchweakobjectionsastheauthorraises 
hereagainstme. 


27. 
The 
parts 
of 
time 
or 
place, 
considered 
in 
themselves, 
are 
ideal 
things; 
and 
therefore 
they 
perfectly 
resemble 
one 
another, 
like 
to 
abstract 
units. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
so 
with 
two 
concrete 
ones, 
or 
with 
two 
real 
times, 
or 
two 
spaces 
filled 
up, 
thatis, 
truly 
actual. 
28. 
I 
don’t 
say 
that 
two 
points 
of 
space 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
point, 
nor 
that 
two 
instants 
of 
time 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
instant, 
as 
the 
author 
seems 
to 
charge 
me 
with 
saying. 
But 
a 
man 
may 
fancy, 
for 
want 
of 
knowledge, 
that 
there 
are 
two 
different 
instants, 
where 
there 
is 
but 
one: 
in 
like 
manner 
as 
I 
observed 
in 
the 
17th 
paragraph 
of 
the 
foregoing 
answer, 
that 
frequently 
in 
geometrywesupposetwo,inorderto 
representtheerrorofagainsayer,when 
there 
is 
really 
but 
one. 
If 
any 
man 
should 
suppose 
that 
a 
right 
line 
cuts 
another 
in 
two 
points; 
it 
will 
be 
found 
after 
all, 
that 
those 
two 
pretended 
points 
mustcoincide, 
andmakebut 
one 
point. 
29. 
I 
have 
demonstrated, 
that 
space 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
an 
order 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
things, 
observed 
as 
existing 
together; 
and 
therefore 
the 
fiction 
of 
a 
material 
finite 
universe, 
moving 
forward 
in 
an 
infinite 
empty 
space, 
cannot 
he 
admitted. 
It 
is 
altogether 
unreasonable 
and 
impracticable. 
For, 
besides 
that 
there 
is 
no 
real 
space 
out 
of 
the 
material 
universe; 
such 
an 
action 
would 
be 
without 
any 
design 
in 
it: 
it 
would 
be 
working 
without 
doing 
anything, 
agendo 
nihil 
agere. 
There 
would 
happen 
no 
change, 
which 
could 
be 
observed 
by 
any 
person 
whatsoever. 
These 
are 
imaginations 
of 
philosophers 
who 
have 
incomplete 
notions, 
who 
make 
space 
an 
absolute 
reality. 
Mere 
mathematicians, 
who 
are 
only 
taken 
up 
with 
the 
conceits 
of 
imagination, 
are 
apttoforgesuch 
notions;buttheyare 
destroyed 
bysuperior 
reasons. 
30. 
Absolutely 
speaking, 
it 
appears 
that 
God 
can 
make 
the 
material 
universe 
finite 
in 
extension; 
but 
the 
contrary 
appears 
more 
agreeable 
to 
his 

wisdom. 


31. 
I 
don’t 
grant, 
that 
every 
finite 
is 
movable. 
According 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
my 
adversaries 
themselves, 
a 
part 
of 
space, 
though 
finite, 
is 
not 
movable. 
What 
is 
movable, 
must 
be 
capable 
of 
changing 
its 
situation 
with 
respect 
to 
something 
else, 
and 
to 
be 
in 
a 
new 
state 
discernible 
from 
the 
first: 
otherwise 
the 
change 
is 
but 
a 
fiction. 
A 
movable 
finite, 
must 
therefore 
make 
part 
of 
another 
finite,that 
anychangemayhappenwhich 
canbe 
observed. 
32. 
Cartesius 
maintains, 
that 
matter 
is 
unlimited; 
and 
I 
don’t 
think 
he 
has 
been 
sufficiently 
confuted. 
And 
though 
this 
be 
granted 
him, 
yet 
it 
does 
not 
followthatmatterwouldbe 
necessary, 
nor 
that 
it 
would 
have 
existed 
from 
all 
eternity; 
since 
that 
unlimited 
diffusion 
of 
matter, 
would 
only 
be 
an 
effect

Since 
space 
in 
itself 
is 
an 
ideal 
thing, 
like 
time; 
space 
out 
of 
the 
world 
must 
needs 
be 
imaginary, 
as 
the 
schoolmen 
themselves 
have 
acknowledged. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
with 
empty 
space 
within 
the 
world; 
which 
I 
take 
also 
to 
beimaginary,forthereasonsbefore 
alleged. 
34. 
The 
author 
objects 
against 
me 
the 
vacuum 
discovered 
by 
Mr. 
Guerike 
of 
Magdeburg, 
which 
is 
made 
by 
pumping 
the 
air 
out 
of 
a 
receiver; 
and 
he 
pretends 
that 
there 
is 
truly 
a 
perfect 
vacuum, 
ora 
space 
without 
matter 
(at 
least 
in 
part), 
in 
that 
receiver. 
The 
Aristotelians 
and 
Cartesians, 
who 
do 
not 
admit 
a 
true 
vacuum, 
have 
said 
in 
answer 
to 
that 
experiment 
of 
Mr. 
Guerike, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
that 
of 
Torricellius 
of 
Florence 
(who 
emptied 
the 
air 
out 
of 
a 
glass-tube 
by 
the 
help 
of 
quicksilver), 
that 
there 
is 
no 
vacuum 
at 
all 
in 
the 
tube 
or 
in 
the 
receiver: 
since 
glass 
has 
small 
pores, 
which 
the 
beams 
of 
light, 
the 
effluvia 
of 
the 
loadstone, 
and 
other 
very 
thin 
fluids 
may 
go 
through. 
I 
am 
of 
their 
opinion: 
and 
I 
think 
the 
receiver 
may 
be 
compared 
to 
a 
box 
full 
of 

holes 
in 
the 
water, 
having 
fish 
or 
other 
gross 
bodies 
shut 
up 
in 
it; 
which 
being 
taken 
out, 
their 
place 
would 
nevertheless 
be 
filled 
up 
with 
water. 
There 
is 
only 
this 
difference; 
that 
though 
water 
be 
fluid 
and 
more 
yielding 
than 
those 
gross 
bodies, 
yet 
it 
is 
as 
heavy 
and 
massive, 
if 
not 
more, 
than 
they: 
whereas 
the 
matter 
which 
gets 
into 
the 
receiver 
in 
the 
room 
of 
the 
air, 
is 
much 
more 
subtile. 
The 
new 
sticklers 
for 
a 
vacuum 
allege 
in 
answer 
to 
this 
instance, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
the 
grossness 
of 
matter, 
but 
its 
mere 
quantity, 
that 
makes 
resistance; 
and 
consequently 
that 
there 
is 
of 
necessity 
more 
vacuum, 
where 
there 
is 
less 
resistance. 
They 
add, 
that 
the 
subtileness 
of 
matters 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
here; 
and 
that 
the 
particles 
of 
quicksilver 
are 
as 
subtile 
and 
fine 
as 
those 
of 
water 
and 
yet 
that 
quicksilver 
resists 
above 
ten 
times 
more. 
To 
this 
I 
reply, 
that 
it 
is 
notsomuchthe 
quantity 
of 
matter, 
as 
its 
difficulty 
of 
giving 
place, 
that 
makes 
resistance. 
For 
instance; 
floating 
timber 
contains 
less 
of 
heavy 
matter, 
than 
an 
equal 
bulk 
of 
water 
does; 
and 
yet 
it 
makes 
more 
resistance 
to 
a 
boat, 
than 
thewater 
does. 


35. 
And 
as 
for 
quicksilver; 
’tis 
true, 
it 
contains 
about 
fourteen 
times 
more 
of 
heavy 
matter, 
than 
an 
equal 
bulk 
of 
water 
does; 
but 
it 
does 
not 
follow, 
that 
it 
contains 
fourteen 
times 
more 
matter 
absolutely. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
water 
contains 
as 
much 
matter; 
if 
we 
include 
both 
its 
own 
matter, 
which 
is 
heavy; 
and 
the 
extraneous 
matter 
void 
of 
heaviness, 
which 
passes 
through 
its 
pores. 
For, 
both 
quicksilver 
and 
water, 
are 
masses 
of 
heavy 
matter, 
full 
of 
pores, 
through 
which 
there 
passes 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
matter 
void 
of 
heaviness 
[and 
which 
does 
not 
sensibly 
resist]; 
such 
as 
is 
probably 
that 
of’ 
the 
rays 
of 
light, 
and 
other 
insensible 
fluids; 
and 
especially 
that 
which 
is 
itself 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
gravity 
of 
gross 
bodies, 
by 
receding 
from 
the 
center 
towards 
which 
it 
drives 
those 
bodies. 
For, 
it 
is 
a 
strange 
imagination 
to 
make 
all 
matter 
gravitate, 
and 
that 
towards, 
all 
other 
matter, 
as 
if 
each 
body 
did 
equally 
attract 
every 
other 
body 
according 
to 
their 
masses 
and 
distances’; 
and 
this 
by 
an 
attraction 

properly 
so 
called, 
which 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
an 
occult 
impulse 
of 
bodies: 
whereas 
the 
gravity 
of 
sensible 
bodies 
towards 
the 
center 
of 
the 
earth, 
ought 
to 
be 
produced 
by 
the 
motion 
of 
some 
fluid. 
And 
the 
case 
must 
be 
the 
same 
with 
other 
gravities, 
such 
as 
is 
that 
of 
the 
planets 
towards 
the 
sun 
or 
towards 
each 
other. 
[A 
body 
is 
never 
moved 
naturally 
except 
by 
another 
body 
which 
impels 
it 
by 
touching 
it; 
and 
afterwards 
it 
advances 
until 
it 
is 
stopped 
by 
another 
body 
which 
touches 
it. 
Every 
other 
operation 
on 
bodies 
is 
either 
miraculousorimaginary.] 


To§8and

I 
objected, 
that 
space, 
taken 
for 
something 
real 
and 
absolute 
without 
bodies,wouldbe 
athingeternal,impassible, 
andindependentupon 
God.. 
The 
author 
endeavors 
to 
elude 
this 
difficulty, 
by 
saying 
that 
space 
is 
a 
property 
of 
God. 
In 
answer 
to 
this, 
I 
have 
said, 
in 
my 
foregoing 
paper, 
that 
the 
property 
of 
God 
is 
immensity; 
but 
that 
space 
(which 
is 
often 
commensurate 
with 
bodies),andGod’simmensity, 
are 
notthesamething. 
37. 
I 
objected 
further, 
that 
if 
space 
be 
a 
property, 
and 
infinite 
space 
be 
the 
immensity 
of 
God; 
finite 
space 
will 
be 
the 
extension 
or 
mensurdbility 
of 
something 
finite. 
And 
therefore 
the 
space 
taken 
up 
by 
a, 
body, 
will 
be 
the 
extension 
of 
that 
body. 
Which 
is 
an 
absurdity; 
since 
a 
body 
can 
change 
space, 
butcannotleaveits 
extension. 
38. 
I 
asked 
also: 
if 
space 
is 
a 
property, 
what 
thing 
will 
an 
empty 
limited 
space, 
(such 
as 
that 
which 
my 
adversary 
imagines 
in 
an 
exhausted 
receiver), 
be 
the 
property 
of? 
It 
does 
not 
appear 
reasonable 
to 
say, 
that 
this 
empty 
space 
either 
round 
or 
square, 
is 
a 
property 
of 
God. 
Will 
it 
be 
then 
perhaps 
the 
property 
of 
some 
immaterial, 
extended, 
imaginary 
substances, 
which 
the 
authorseemsto 
fancyin 
the 
imaginaryspaces? 

39. 
If 
space 
is 
the 
property 
or 
affection 
of 
the 
substance, 
which 
is 
in 
space; 
the 
same 
space 
will 
be 
sometimes 
the 
affection 
of 
one 
body, 
sometimes 
of 
(mother 
body, 
sometimes 
of 
an 
immaterial 
substance, 
and 
sometimes 
perhaps 
of 
God 
himself, 
when 
it 
is 
void 
of 
all 
other 
substance 
material 
or 
immaterial. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
strange 
property 
or 
affection, 
which 
passes 
from 
one 
subject 
to 
another. 
Thus 
subjects 
will 
leave 
off 
their 
accidents, 
like 
clothes; 
that 
other 
subjects 
may 
put 
them 
on. 
At 
this 
rate, 
how 
shall 
we 
distinguish 
accidents 
and 
substances? 
40. 
And 
if 
limited 
spaces 
are 
the 
affections 
of 
limited, 
substances, 
which 
are 
in 
them; 
and 
infinite 
space 
be 
a 
property 
of 
God; 
a 
property 
of 
God 
must 
(which 
is 
very 
strange), 
be 
made 
up 
of 
the 
affections 
of 
creatures; 
for 
all 
finitespacestakentogether 
make 
upinfinitespace. 
41. 
But 
if 
the 
author 
denies, 
that 
limited 
space 
is 
an 
affection 
of 
limited 
things; 
it 
will 
not 
be 
reasonable 
neither, 
that 
infinite 
space 
should 
be 
the 
affection 
or 
propertyof 
an 
infinite 
thing. 
Ihavesuggestedallthesedifficulties 
in 
my 
foregoing 
paper; 
but 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
that 
the 
author 
has 
endeavored 
toanswer 
them. 
42. 
I 
have 
still 
other 
reasons 
against 
this 
strange 
imagination, 
that 
space 
is 
a 
property 
of 
God. 
If 
it 
be 
so, 
space 
belongs 
to 
the 
essence 
of 
God. 
But 
space 
has 
parts: 
therefore 
there 
would 
be 
parts 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
God. 
Spectatum 
admissi. 
43. 
Moreover, 
spaces 
are 
sometimes 
empty, 
and 
sometimes 
filled 
up. 
Therefore 
there 
will 
be 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
God, 
parts 
sometimes 
empty 
and 
sometimes 
full, 
and 
consequently 
liable 
to 
a 
perpetual 
change. 
Bodies, 
filling 
up 
space, 
would 
fill 
up 
part 
of 
God’s 
essence, 
and 
would 
be 
commensurate 
with 
it; 
and 
in 
the 
supposition 
of 
a 
vacuum, 
part 
of 
God’s 
essence 
will 
be 
within 
the 
receiver. 
Such 
a 
God 
having 
parts, 
will 
very 
much 
resemble 
the 
Stoic’s 
God,which 
wasthewholeuniverseconsideredasadivine 
animal. 

“. 
Ifinfinite 
space 
isGod’s 
immensity, 
infinite 
time 
will 
be 
God’s 
eternity; 
and 
therefore 
we 
must 
say, 
that 
what 
is 
in 
space, 
is 
in 
God’s 
immensity, 
and 
consequently 
in 
his 
essence; 
and 
that 
what 
is 
in 
time, 
is 
also 
in 
the 
essence 
of 
God. 
Strange 
expressions;whichplainly 
show,that 
theauthormakesawrong 
useofterms. 


45. 
I 
shall 
give 
another 
instance 
of 
this. 
God’s 
immensity 
makes 
him 
actually 
present 
in 
all 
spaces. 
But 
now 
if 
God 
is 
in 
space, 
how 
can 
it 
be 
said 
that 
spaceis 
in 
God, 
or 
that 
it 
is 
a 
property 
of 
God? 
We 
have 
often 
heard, 
that 
a 
property 
is 
in 
its 
subject; 
but 
we 
never 
heard, 
that 
a 
subject 
is 
in 
its 
property. 
In 
like 
manner, 
God 
exists 
in 
all 
time. 
How 
then 
can 
time 
be 
in 
God;andhowcanit 
bea 
propertyof 
God?Theseareperpetual 
alloglossies. 
46. 
It 
appears 
that 
the 
author 
confounds 
immensity, 
or 
the 
extension 
of 
things, 
with 
the 
space 
according 
to 
which 
that 
extension 
is 
taken. 
Infinite 
space 
is 
not 
the 
immensity 
of 
God; 
finite 
space 
is 
not 
the 
extension 
of 
bodies: 
as 
time 
is 
not 
their 
duration. 
Things 
keep 
their, 
extension, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
always 
keep 
their 
space. 
Everything 
has 
its 
own 
extension, 
its 
own 
duration; 
butit 
hasnotitsowntime,anddoes 
notkeep 
itsownspace. 
47. 
I 
will 
here 
show, 
how 
men 
come 
to 
form 
to 
themselves 
the 
notion 
of 
space. 
They 
consider 
that 
manythings 
existatonce, 
andthey 
observe 
inthem 
a 
certain 
order 
of 
co-existence,according 
to 
which 
the 
relationofonething 
to 
another 
is 
more 
or 
less 
simple. 
This 
order 
is 
their 
situation 
or 
distance. 
When 
it 
happens 
that 
one 
of 
those 
co-existent 
things 
changes 
its 
relation 
to 
a 
multitude 
“of 
others, 
which 
do 
not 
change 
their 
relation 
among 
themselves; 
and 
that 
another 
thing, 
newly 
come, 
acquires 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
the 
others, 
astheformerhad;wethensayit 
iscomeinto 
theplaceof 
the 
former;andthis 
change, 
we 
call 
a 
motion 
in 
that 
body, 
wherein 
is 
the 
immediate 
cause 
of 
the 
change. 
And 
though 
many, 
or 
even 
all 
the 
co-existent 
things, 
should 
change 
according 
to 
certain 
known 
rules 
of 
direction 
and 
swiftness; 
yet 
one 
may 

always 
determine 
the 
relation 
of 
situation, 
which 
every 
co-existent 
acquires 
with 
respect 
to 
every 
other 
co-existent; 
and 
even 
that 
relation, 
which 
any 
other 
co-existent 
would 
have 
to 
this, 
or 
which 
this 
would 
have 
to 
any 
other, 
if 
it 
had 
not 
changed, 
or 
if 
it 
had 
changed 
any 
otherwise. 
And 
supposing, 
or 
feigning, 
that 
among 
those 
co-existents, 
there 
is 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
them, 
which 
have 
undergone 
no 
change; 
then 
we 
may 
say, 
that 
those 
which 
have 
such 
a 
relation 
to 
those 
fixed 
existents, 
as 
others 
had 
to 
them 
before, 
have 
now 
the 
same 
place 
which 
those 
others 
had. 
And 
that 
which 
comprehends 
all 
those 
places, 
is 
called 
space. 
Which 
shows, 
that 
in 
order 
to 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
place, 
and 
consequently 
of 
space, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
consider 
these 
relations, 
and 
the 
rules 
of 
their 
changes, 
without 
needing 
to 
fancy 
any 
absolute 
reality 
out 
of 
the 
things 
whose 
situation 
we 
consider, 
and, 
to 
give 
a 
kind 
of 
definition: 
place 
is 
that, 
which 
we 
say 
is 
the 
same 
to 
A, 
and 
to 
B, 
when 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
B, 
with 
C, 
E, 
F, 
G, 
&c. 
agrees 
perfectly 
with 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
co-existence, 
which 
A 
had 
with 
the 
same 
C, 
E, 
E, 
G, 
disc. 
supposing 
there 
has 
been 
no 
cause 
of 
change 
in 
C, 
E, 
F, 
G, 
&c. 
It 
might 
be 
said 
also, 
without 
entering 
into 
any 
further 
particularity, 
that 
place 
is 
that, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
in 
different 
moments 
to 
different 
existent 
things, 
when 
their 
relations 
of 
co-existence 
with 
certain 
other 
existents, 
which 
are 
supposed 
to 
continue 
fixed 
from 
one 
of 
those 
moments 
to 
the 
other, 
agree 
entirely 
together. 
And 
fixed 
existents 
are 
those, 
in 
which 
there 
has 
been 
no 
cause 
of 
any 
change 
of 
the 
order 
of 
their 
co-existence 
with 
others; 
or 
(which 
is 
the 
same 
thing), 
in 
which 
there 
has 
been 
no 
motion. 
Lastly, 
space 
is 
that 
which 
results 
from 
places 
taken 
together. 
And 
here 
it 
may 
not 
be 
amiss 
to 
consider 
the 
difference 
between 
place, 
and 
the 
relation 
of 
situation, 
which 
is 
in 
the 
body 
that 
fills 
up 
the 
place. 
For, 
the 
place 
of 
A 
and 
B, 
is 
the 
same; 
whereas 
the 
relation 
of 
A 
to 
fixed 
bodies, 
is 
not 
precisely 
and 
individually 
the 
same, 
as 
the 
relation 
which 
B 
(that 
comes 
into 
its 
place) 
will 
have 
to 
the 
same 



fixed 
bodies; 
but 
these 
relations 
agree 
only. 
For 
two 
different 
subjects, 
as 
A 
and 
B, 
cannot 
have 
precisely 
the 
same 
individual 
affection; 
it 
being 
impossible, 
that 
the 
same 
individual 
accident 
should 
be 
in 
two 
subjects, 
or 
pass 
from 
one 
subject 
to 
another. 
But 
the 
mind 
not 
contented 
with 
an 
agreement, 
looks 
for 
an 
identity, 
for 
something 
that 
should 
be 
truly 
the 
same; 
and 
conceivesitas 
being 
extrinsictothe 
subject: 
and 
this 
is 
what 
we 
here 
call 
place 
and 
space. 
But 
this 
can 
only 
be 
an 
ideal 
thing; 
containing 
a 
certain 
order, 
wherein 
the 
mind 
conceives 
the 
application 
of 
relations. 
In 
like 
manner, 
as 
the 
mind 
can 
fancy 
to 
itself 
an 
order 
made 
up 
of 
genealogical 
lines, 
whose 
bigness 
would 
consist 
only 
in 
the 
number 
of 
generations, 
wherein 
every 
person 
would 
have 
his 
place: 
and 
if 
to 
this 
one 
should 
add 
the 
fiction 
of 
a 
metempsychosis, 
and 
bring 
in 
the 
same 
human 
souls 
again; 
the 
persons 
in 
those 
lines 
might 
change 
place; 
he 
who 
was 
a 
father, 
or 
a 
grandfather, 
might 
become 
a 
son, 
or 
a 
grand-son, 
&c. 
And 
yet 
those 
genealogical 
places, 
lines, 
and 
spaces, 
though 
they 
should 
express 
real 
truths, 
would 
only 
be 
ideal 
things. 
I 
shall 
allege 
another 
example, 
to 
show 
how 
the 
mind 
uses, 
upon 
occasion 
of 
accidents 
which 
are 
in 
subjects, 
to 
fancy 
to 
itself 
something 
answerable 
to 
those 
accidents, 
out 
of 
the 
subjects. 
The 
ratio 
or 
proportion 
between 
two 
lines 
L 
and 
M, 
may 
be 
conceived 
three 
several 
ways; 
as 
a 
ratio 
of 
the 
greater 
L 
to 
the 
lesser 
M; 
as 
a 
ratio 
of 
the 
lesser 
M 
to 
the 
greater 
L; 
and 
lastly, 
as 
something 
abstracted 
from 
both, 
that 
is, 
as 
the 
ratio 
between 
L 
and 
M, 
without 
considering 
which 
is 
the 
antecedent, 
or 
which 
the 
consequent; 
which 
the 
subject, 
and 
which 
the 
object. 
And 
thus 
it 
is, 
that 
proportions 
are 
considered 
inmusic. 
Inthefirst 
wayofconsidering 
them, 
L 
the 
greater; 
in 
the 
second, 
M 
the 
lesser, 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
that 
accident, 
which 
philosophers 
call 
relation. 
But, 
which 
of 
them 
will 
be 
the 
subject, 
in 
the 
third 
way 
of 
considering 
them? 
It 
cannot 
be 
said 
that 
both 
of 
them, 
L 
and 
M 
together, 
are 
the 
subject 
of 
such 
an 
accident; 
for 
if 
so, 
we 
should 
have 
an 
accident 
in 
two 



subjects, 
with 
one 
leg 
in 
one, 
and 
the 
other 
in 
the 
other; 
which 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
accidents. 
Therefore 
we 
must 
say 
that 
this 
relation, 
in 
this 
third 
way 
of 
considering 
it, 
is 
indeed 
out 
of 
the 
subjects; 
but 
being 
neither 
a 
substance, 
nor 
an 
accident, 
it 
must 
be 
a 
mere 
ideal 
thing, 
the 
consideration 
of 
which 
is 
nevertheless 
useful. 
To 
conclude: 
I 
have 
here 
done 
much 
like 
Euclid, 
who 
not 
being 
able 
to 
make 
his 
readers 
well 
understand 
what 
ratio 
is 
absolutely 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
geometricians; 
defines 
what 
are 
the 
same 
ratios. 
Thus, 
in 
like 
manner, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
what 
place 
is, 
I 
have 
been 
content 
to 
define 
what 
is 
the 
same 
place. 
Lastly; 
I 
observe, 
that 
the 
traces 
of 
movable 
bodies, 
which 
they 
leave 
sometimes 
upon 
the 
immovable 
ones 
on 
which 
they 
are 
moved; 
have 
given 
men 
occasion 
to 
form 
in 
their 
imagination 
such 
an 
idea, 
as 
if 
some 
trace 
did 
still 
remain, 
even 
when 
there 
is 
nothing 
unmoved. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
mere 
ideal 
thing, 
and 
imports 
only, 
that 
if 
there 
was 
any 
unmoved 
thing 
there, 
the 
trace 
might 
be 
marked 
out 
upon 
it. 
And 
’tis 
this 
analogy, 
which 
makes 
men 
fancy 
places, 
traces 
and 
spaces; 
though 
those 
things 
consist 
only 
in 
the 
truth 
of 
relations, 
and 
not 
at 
all 
in 
any 
absolute 
reality. 


48. 
To 
conclude. 
If 
the 
space 
(which 
the 
author 
fancies) 
void 
of 
all 
bodies, 
is 
not 
altogether 
empty; 
what 
is 
it 
then 
full 
of? 
Is 
it 
full 
of 
extended 
spirits 
perhaps, 
or 
immaterial 
substances, 
capable 
of 
extending 
and 
contracting 
themselves; 
which 
move 
therein, 
and 
penetrate 
each 
other 
without 
any 
inconveniency, 
as 
the 
shadows 
of 
two 
bodies 
penetrate 
one 
another 
upon 
the 
surface 
of 
a 
wall? 
Methinks 
I 
see 
the 
revival 
of 
the 
odd 
imaginations 
of 
Dr. 
Henry 
More 
(otherwise 
a 
learned 
and 
well-meaning 
man), 
and 
of 
some 
others, 
who 
fancied 
that 
those 
spirits 
can 
make 
themselves 
impenetrable 
whenever 
they 
please. 
May, 
some 
have 
fancied, 
that 
man 
in 
the 
state 
of 
innocency, 
had 
also 
the 
gift 
of 
penetration; 
and 
that 
he 
became 
solid, 
opaque, 
and 
impenetrable 
by 
his 
fall. 
Is 
it 
not 
overthrowing 
our 
notions 
of 
things, 
to 

make 
God 
have 
parts, 
to 
make 
spirits 
have 
extension? 
The 
principle 
of 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
does 
alone 
drive 
away 
all 
these 
spectres 
of 
imagination. 
Men 
easily 
run 
into 
fictions, 
for 
want 
of 
making 
a 
right 
use 
of 
that 
great 
principle.

Itcannotbe 
said,that[acertain] 
duration 
iseternal;butthat 
things,which 
continue 
always, 
are 
eternal, 
[by 
gaining 
always 
new 
duration.] 
Whatever 
exists 
of 
time 
and 
of 
duration, 
[being 
successive] 
perishes 
continually: 
and 
how 
can 
a 
thing 
exist 
eternally, 
which, 
(to 
speak 
exactly,) 
does 
never 
exist 
at 
all? 
For, 
how 
can 
a 
thing 
exist, 
whereof 
no 
part 
does 
ever 
exist? 
Nothing 
of 
time 
does 
ever 
exist, 
but 
instants; 
and 
an 
instant 
is 
not 
even 
itself 
a 
part 
of 
time. 
Whoever 
considers 
these 
observations, 
will 
easily 
apprehend 
that 
time 
can 
only 
be 
an 
ideal 
thing. 
And 
the 
analogy 
between 
time 
and 
space, 
will 
easily 
make 
it 
appear, 
that 
the 
one 
is 
as 
merely 
ideal 
as 
the 
other. 
[However, 
if 
by 
saying 
that 
the 
duration 
of 
a 
thing 
is 
eternal, 
is 
merely 
understood 
that 
it 
lastseternally,I 
havenoobjection.] 
50. 
If 
the 
reality 
of 
space 
and 
time, 
is 
necessary 
to 
the 
immensity 
and 
eternity 
of 
God; 
if 
God 
must 
be 
in 
space; 
if 
being 
in 
space, 
is 
a 
property 
of 
God; 
he 
will, 
in 
some 
measure, 
depend 
upon 
time 
and 
space, 
and 
stand 
in 
need 
of 
them. 
For 
I 
have 
already 
prevented 
that 
subterfuge, 
that 
space 
and 
time 
are 
[in 
God 
and 
as 
it 
were] 
properties 
of 
God. 
[Could 
the 
opinion 
which 
should 
affirm 
that 
bodies 
move 
about 
in 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
divine 
essence 
be 
maintained?] 
To§ 
11and 
12. 


51. 
I 
objected 
that 
space 
cannot 
be 
in 
God, 
because 
it 
has 
parts. 
Hereuponthe 
author 
seeks 
another 
subterfuge, 
by 
departing 
from 
the 
received 
sense 
of 

words; 
maintaining 
that 
space 
has 
no 
parts, 
because 
its 
parts 
are 
not 
separable, 
and 
cannot 
be 
removed 
from 
one 
another 
by 
discerption. 
But 
’tis 
sufficient 
that 
space 
has 
parts, 
whether 
those 
parts 
be 
separable 
or 
not; 
and 
they 
may 
be 
assigned 
in 
space, 
either 
by 
the 
bodies 
that 
are 
in 
it, 
or 
by 
lines 
and 
surfacesthatmaybe 
drawnanddescribedinit. 


52. 
In 
order 
to 
prove 
that 
space, 
without 
bodies, 
is 
an 
absolute 
reality; 
the 
authorobjected,thata 
finitematerialuniversemight 
move 
forward 
in 
space. 
I 
answered, 
it 
does 
not 
appear 
reasonable 
that 
the 
material 
universe 
should 
be 
finite; 
and, 
though 
we 
should 
suppose 
it 
to 
be 
finite; 
yet 
’tis 
unreasonable 
it 
should 
have 
motion 
any 
otherwise, 
than 
as 
its 
parts 
change 
their 
situation 
among 
themselves; 
because 
such 
a 
motion 
would 
produce 
no 
charge 
that 
could 
he 
observed, 
and 
would 
be 
without 
design. 
’Tis 
another 
thing, 
when 
its 
parts 
change 
their 
situation 
among 
themselves; 
for 
then 
there 
is 
a 
motion 
in 
space; 
but 
it 
consists 
in 
the 
order 
of 
relations 
which 
are 
changed. 
The 
author 
replies 
now, 
that 
the 
reality 
of 
motion 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
being 
observed; 
and 
that 
a 
ship 
may 
go 
forward, 
and 
yet 
a 
man, 
who 
is 
in 
the 
ship, 
may 
not 
perceive 
it. 
I 
answer, 
motion 
does 
not 
indeed 
depend 
upon 
being 
observed; 
but 
it 
does 
depend 
upon 
being 
possible 
to 
be 
observed. 
There 
is 
no 
motion, 
when 
there 
is 
no 
change 
that 
can 
be 
observed. 
And 
when 
there 
is 
no 
change 
that 
can 
be 
observed, 
there 
is 
no 
change 
at 
all. 
The 
contrary 
opinion 
is 
grounded 
upon 
the 
supposition 
of 
a 
real 
absolute 
space, 
which 
I 
have 
demonstratively 
confuted 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
ofthings. 
53. 
Ifindnothinginthe 
eighth 
definition 
of 
the 
Mathematical 
Principles 
of 
Nature, 
nor 
in 
the 
scholium 
belonging 
to 
it, 
that 
proves, 
or 
can 
prove, 
the 
reality 
of 
space 
in 
itself. 
However, 
I 
grant 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
an 
absolute 
true 
motion 
of 
a 
body, 
and 
a 
mere 
relative 
change 
of 
its 
situation 
with 
respect 
to 
another 
body. 
For 
when 
the 
immediate 
cause 
of 
the 
change 
is 

in 
the 
body, 
that 
body 
is 
truly 
in 
motion; 
and 
then 
the 
situation 
of 
other 
bodies, 
with 
respect 
to 
it, 
will 
be 
changed 
consequently, 
though 
the 
cause 
of 
that 
change 
be 
not 
in 
them. 
’Tis 
true 
that, 
exactly 
speaking, 
there 
is 
not 
any 
one 
body, 
that 
is 
perfectly 
and 
entirely 
at 
rest; 
but 
we 
frame 
an 
abstract 
notion 
of 
rest, 
by 
considering 
the 
thing 
mathematically. 
Thus 
have 
I 
left 
nothing 
unanswered, 
of 
what 
has 
been 
alleged 
for 
the 
absolute 
reality 
of 
space. 
And 
I 
have 
demonstrated 
the 
falsehood 
of 
that 
reality, 
by 
a 
fundamental 
principle, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
certain 
both 
in 
reason 
and 
experience; 
against 
which, 
no 
exception 
or 
instance 
can 
be 
alleged. 
Upon 
the 
whole, 
one 
may 
judge 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said, 
that 
I 
ought 
not 
to 
admit 
a 
movable 
universe; 
norany 
place 
out 
ofthematerialuniverse. 


54. 
I 
am 
not 
sensible 
of 
any 
objection, 
but 
what 
I 
think 
I 
have 
sufficiently 
answered. 
As 
for 
the 
objection 
that 
space 
and 
time 
are 
quantities, 
or 
rather 
things 
endowed 
with 
quantity; 
and 
that 
situation 
and 
order 
are 
not 
so: 
I 
answer, 
that 
order 
also 
has 
its 
quantity; 
there 
is 
in 
it, 
that 
which 
goes 
before, 
and 
thatwhichfollows; 
there 
isdistanceorinterval. 
Relative 
thingshavetheir 
quantity, 
as 
well 
as 
absolute 
ones. 
For 
instance, 
ratios 
or 
proportions 
in 
mathematics, 
have 
their 
quantity, 
and 
are 
measured 
by 
logarithms; 
and 
yet 
they 
are 
relations. 
And 
therefore 
though 
time 
and 
space 
consist 
in 
relations, 
yettheyhavetheir 
quantity. 
To§ 
15. 


55. 
As 
to 
the 
question, 
whether 
God 
could 
have 
created 
the 
world 
sooner; 
’tis 
necessary 
here 
to 
understand 
each 
other 
rightly. 
Since 
I 
have 
demonstrated, 
that 
time, 
without 
things, 
is 
nothing 
else 
but 
a 
mere 
ideal 
possibility; 
’tis 
manifest, 
if 
any 
one 
should 
say 
that 
this 
same 
world, 
which 
has 
been 
actually 
created, 
might 
have 
been 
created 
sooner, 
without 
any 
other 
change; 
he 
would 
say 
nothing 
that 
is 
intelligible. 
For 
there 
is 
no 
mark 
or 
difference, 
whereby 
it 

would 
be 
possible 
to 
know, 
that 
this 
world 
was 
created 
sooner. 
And 
therefore, 
(as 
I 
have 
already 
said), 
to 
suppose 
that 
God 
created 
the 
same 
world 
sooner, 
is 
supposing 
a 
chimerical 
thing. 
’Tis 
making 
time 
a 
thing 
absolute, 
independent 
upon 
God; 
whereas 
time 
must 
co-exist 
with 
creatures, 
and 
isonly 
conceivedby 
the 
order 
and 
quantity 
oftheir 
changes. 



56. 
But 
yet 
absolutely 
speaking, 
one 
may 
conceive 
that 
an 
universe 
began 
sooner, 
than 
it 
actually 
did. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
our 
universe, 
or 
any 
other, 
to 
be 
represented 
by 
the 
figure 
A 
F; 
and 
that 
the 
ordinate 
A 
B 
represents 
its 
first 
state; 
and 
the 
ordinates 
C 
D, 
E 
F, 
its 
following 
states: 
I 
say, 
one 
may 

conceive 
that 
such 
a 
world 
began 
sooner, 
by 
conceiving 
the 
figure 
prolonged 
backwards, 
and 
by 
adding 
to 
it 
S 
R 
A 
B 
S. 
For 
thus, 
things 
being 
increased, 
time 
will 
be 
also 
increased. 
But 
whether 
such 
an 
augmentation 
be 
reasonable 
and 
agreeable 
to 
God’s 
wisdom, 
is 
another 
question, 
to 
which 
we 
answer 
in 
the 
negative; 
otherwise 
God 
would 
have 
made 
such 
an 
augmentation. 
It 
would 
be 
—like 
as 


Humano 
capiti 
cervicem 
pictor 
equinam 
Jungere 
si 
velit. 


The 
case 
is 
the 
same 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
destruction 
[duration 
— 
Ger.] 
of 
the 
universe. 
As 
one 
might 
concern 
something 
added 
to 
the 
beginning, 
so 
one 
might 
also 
conceive 
something 
taken 
off 
towards 
the 
end. 
But 
such 
a 
retrenchingfromit,wouldbealso 
unreasonable. 


57. 
Thus 
it 
appears 
how 
we 
are 
to 
understand, 
that 
God 
created 
things 
at 
what 
time 
he 
pleased; 
for 
this 
depends 
upon 
the 
things, 
which 
he 
resolved 
to 
create. 
But 
things 
being 
once 
resolved 
upon, 
together 
with 
their 
relations; 
there 
remains 
no 
longer 
any 
choice 
about 
the 
time 
and 
the 
place, 
which 
of 
themselves 
have 
nothing 
in 
them 
real, 
nothing 
that 
can 
distinguish 
them, 
nothingthat 
isat 
all 
discernible. 
58. 
One 
cannot 
therefore 
say, 
as 
the 
author 
does 
here, 
that 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
may 
have 
good 
reasons 
to 
create 
this 
world 
at 
such 
or 
such 
a 
particular 
time: 
that 
particular 
time, 
considered 
without 
the 
things, 
being 
an 
impossible 
fiction; 
and 
good 
reasons 
for 
a 
choice, 
being 
not 
to 
be 
found, 
where 
everything 
isindiscernible. 
59. 
When 
I 
speak 
of 
this 
world, 
I 
mean 
the 
whole 
universe 
of 
material 
and 
immaterial 
creatures 
taken 
together, 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
things. 
But 
if 
any 
one 
mean 
only 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
material 
world, 
and 
suppose 
immaterial 
creatures 
before 
it; 
he 
would 
have 
somewhat 
more 
reason 
for 
his 
supposition. 
For 
time 
then 
being 
marked 
by 
things 
that 
existed 
already, 
it 
would 
be 
no 

longer 
indifferent; 
and 
there 
might 
be 
room 
for 
choice. 
And 
yet 
indeed, 
this 
would 
be 
only 
putting 
off 
the 
difficulty. 
For, 
supposing 
the 
whole 
universe 
of 
immaterial 
and 
material 
creatures 
together, 
to 
have 
a 
beginning; 
there 
is 
no 
longeranychoice 
aboutthe 
time, 
inwhichGodwouldplacethatbeginning. 


60. 
And 
therefore 
one 
must 
not 
say, 
as 
the 
author 
does 
here, 
that 
God 
created 
things 
in 
what 
particular 
space, 
and 
at 
what 
particular 
time 
he 
pleased. 
For, 
all 
time 
and 
all 
spaces 
being 
in 
themselves 
perfectly 
uniform 
and 
indiscernible 
from 
each 
other, 
one 
of 
them 
cannot 
please 
more 
than 
another. 
61. 
I 
shall 
not 
enlarge 
here 
upon 
my 
opinion 
explained 
elsewhere, 
that 
there 
are 
no 
created 
substances 
wholly 
destitute 
of 
matter. 
For 
I 
hold 
with 
the 
ancients, 
and 
according 
to 
reason, 
that 
angels 
or 
intelligences, 
and 
souls 
separated 
from 
a 
gross 
body, 
have 
always 
subtile 
bodies, 
though 
they 
themselves 
he 
incorporeal. 
The 
vulgar 
philosophy 
easily 
admits 
all 
sorts 
of 
fictions: 
mine

Idon’tsaythatmatterandspace

Ionlysay, 
there 
is

where 
there 
is 
no

and 
that 
space 
in 
itself 
is 
not 
an 
absolute 
reality. 
Space 
and 
matter 
differ, 
as 
time 
and 
motion. 
However, 
these 
things, 
thoughdifferent,are 
inseparable. 
63. 
But 
yet 
it 
does 
not 
at 
all 
follow, 
that 
matter 
is 
eternal 
and 
necessary; 
unless 
we 
suppose 
space 
to 
be 
eternal 
and

To§ 
16and 
17. 


61. 
I 
think 
I 
have 
answered 
everything; 
and 
I 
have 
particularly 
replied 
to 
that 
objection, 
that 
space 
and 
time 
have 
quantity, 
and 
that 
order 
has 
none. 
See 
above, 
Number 
51. 

65. 
I 
have 
clearly 
shown 
that 
the 
contradiction 
lies 
in 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
opposite 
opinion, 
which 
looks 
for 
a 
difference 
where 
there 
is 
none. 
And 
it 
would 
be 
a 
manifest 
iniquity 
to 
infer 
from 
thence, 
that 
I 
have 
acknowledged 
a 
contradictioninmyownopinion. 
To§ 
18. 


66. 
Here 
I 
find 
again 
an 
argument, 
which 
I 
have 
overthrown 
above, 
Number 
17. 
The 
author 
says, 
God 
may 
have 
good 
reasons 
to 
make 
two 
cubes 
perfectly 
equal 
and 
alike: 
and 
then 
(says 
he) 
God 
must 
needs 
assign 
them 
their 
places, 
though 
every 
other 
respect 
be 
perfectly 
equal. 
But 
things 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
separated 
from 
their 
circumstances. 
This 
argument 
consists 
in 
incomplete 
notions. 
God’s 
resolutions 
are 
never 
abstract 
and 
imperfect: 
as 
if 
God 
decreed, 
first, 
to 
create 
the 
two 
cubes; 
and 
then, 
made 
another 
decree 
where 
to 
place 
them. 
Men, 
being 
such 
limited 
creatures 
as 
they 
are, 
may 
act 
in 
this 
manner. 
They 
may 
resolve 
upon 
a 
thing, 
and 
then 
find 
themselves 
perplexed 
about 
means, 
ways, 
places, 
and 
circumstances. 
But 
God 
never 
takes 
a 
resolution 
about 
the 
ends, 
without 
resolving 
at 
the 
same 
time 
about 
the 
means, 
and 
all 
the 
circumstances. 
Nay, 
I 
have 
shown 
in 
my 
Theodicaea, 
that 
properly 
speaking, 
there 
is 
but 
one 
decree 
for 
the 
whole 
universe, 
whereby 
God 
resolved 
to 
bring 
it 
out 
of 
possibility 
into 
existence. 
And 
therefore 
God 
will 
not 
choose 
a 
cube, 
without 
choosing 
its 
place 
at 
the 
same 
time;and 
hewill 
never 
choose 
among 
indiscernibles. 
67. 
The 
parts 
of 
space 
are 
not 
determined 
and 
distinguished, 
but 
by 
the 
things 
which 
are 
in 
it: 
and 
the 
diversity 
of 
things 
in 
space, 
determines 
God 
to 
act 
differently 
upon 
different 
parts 
of 
space. 
But 
space 
without 
things, 
has 
nothingwhereby 
itmay 
bedistinguished;andindeednotanything 
actual. 
68. 
If 
God 
is 
resolved 
to 
place 
a 
certain 
cube 
of 
matter 
at 
all, 
he 
is 
also 
resolved 
in 
which 
particular 
place 
to 
put 
it. 
But 
’tis 
with 
respect 
to 
other 
parts 

of 
matter; 
and 
not 
with 
respect 
to 
bare 
space 
itself, 
in 
which 
there 
is 
nothing 
todistinguishit. 


69. 
But 
wisdom 
does 
not 
allow 
God 
to 
place 
at 
the 
same 
time 
two 
cubes 
perfectly 
equal 
and 
alike; 
because 
there 
is 
no 
way 
to 
find 
any 
reason 
for 
assigning 
them 
different 
places. 
At 
this 
rate, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
will 
without 
a 
motive. 
70. 
A 
will 
without 
motive 
(such 
as 
superficial 
reasoners 
suppose 
to 
be 
in 
God), 
I 
compared 
to 
Epicurus’s 
chance. 
The 
author 
answers; 
Epicurus’s 
chance 
is 
a 
blind 
necessity, 
and 
not 
a 
choice 
of 
will. 
I 
reply, 
that 
Epicurus’s 
chance 
is 
not 
a 
necessity, 
but 
something 
indifferent. 
Epicurus 
brought 
it 
in 
on 
purpose 
to 
avoid 
necessity. 
’Tis 
true, 
chance 
is 
blind; 
but 
a 
will 
without 
motive 
wouldbenolessblind,andnolessowing 
tomerechance. 
To§ 
19. 


71. 
The 
author 
repeats 
here, 
what 
has 
been 
already 
confuted 
above, 
Number 
21; 
that 
matter 
cannot 
be 
created, 
without 
God’s 
choosing 
among 
indiscernibles. 
He 
would 
be 
in 
the 
right, 
if 
matter 
consisted 
of 
atoms, 
similar 
particles, 
or 
other 
the 
like 
fictions 
of 
superficial 
philosophy. 
But 
that 
great 
principle, 
which 
provesthere 
is 
no 
choice 
among 
indiscernibles, 
destroys 
also 
theseill-contrived 
fictions. 
To§ 
20. 


72. 
The 
author 
objected 
against 
me 
in 
his 
third 
paper 
(Numbers 
7 
and 
8); 
that 
God 
would 
not 
have 
in 
himself 
a 
principle 
of 
acting, 
if 
he 
was 
determined 
by 
things 
external. 
I 
answered, 
that 
the 
ideas 
of 
external 
things 
are 
in 
him: 
and 
that 
therefore 
he 
is 
determined 
by 
internal 
reasons, 
that 
is, 
by 
his 
wisdom. 
Butthe 
authorherewillnotunderstand, 
towhatendIsaidit. 

73. 
He 
frequently 
confounds, 
in 
his 
objections 
against 
me, 
what 
God 
will 
not 
do,’ 
with 
what 
he 
cannot 
do. 
See 
above, 
Number 
9[and 
below 
Number 
76]. 
For 
example; 
God 
can 
do 
everything 
that 
is 
possible, 
but 
he 
will 
do 
only 
what 
is 
best. 
And 
therefore 
I 
don’t 
say, 
as 
the 
author 
here 
will 
have 
it, 
that 
God 
cannot 
limit 
the 
extension 
of 
matter; 
but 
’tis 
likely 
he 
will 
not 
do 
it, 
and 
that,hehasthoughtit 
betterto 
set 
noboundsto 
matter. 
74. 
From 
extension 
to 
duration, 
non 
valet 
consequentia. 
Though 
the 
extension 
of 
matter 
were 
unlimited, 
yet 
it 
would 
not 
follow 
that 
its 
duration 
would 
be 
also 
unlimited; 
nay 
even 
à 
parte 
ante, 
it 
would 
not 
follow, 
that 
it 
had 
no 
beginning. 
If 
it 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
things 
in 
the 
whole, 
to 
grow 
uniformly 
in 
perfection; 
the 
universe 
of 
creatures 
must 
have 
had 
a 
beginning. 
And 
therefore, 
there 
will 
be 
reasons 
to 
limit 
the 
duration 
of 
things, 
even 
though 
there 
were 
none 
to 
limit 
their 
extension. 
Besides, 
the 
world’s 
having 
a 
beginning,does 
not 
derogatefromtheinfinityofits 
duration 
à 
parte 
post; 
but 
bounds 
of 
the 
universe 
would 
derogate 
from 
the 
infinity 
of 
its 
extension. 
And 
therefore 
it 
is 
more 
reasonable 
to 
admit 
a 
beginning 
of 
the 
world, 
than 
to 
admit 
any 
bounds 
of 
it; 
that 
the 
character 
of 
its 
infinite 
author, 
may 
be 
in 
both 
respects 
preserved. 
75. 
However, 
those 
who 
have 
admitted 
the 
eternity 
of 
the 
world, 
or, 
at 
least, 
(as 
some 
famous 
divines 
have 
done), 
the 
possibility 
of 
its 
eternity; 
did 
not, 
for 
all 
that, 
deny 
its 
dependence 
upon 
God; 
as 
the 
author 
here 
lays 
to 
theircharge, 
without 
anyground. 
To§22,23. 


76. 
He 
here 
further 
objects, 
without 
any 
reason, 
that, 
according 
to 
my 
opinion, 
whatever 
God 
can 
do, 
he 
must 
needs 
have 
done. 
As 
if 
he 
was 
ignorant,that 
I 
have 
solidly 
confuted 
thisnotion 
in 
my 
Theodicaea; 
and 
that 
I 
have 
overthrown 
the 
opinion 
of 
those, 
who 
maintain 
that 
there 
is 
nothing 

possible 
but 
what 
really 
happens; 
as 
some 
ancient 
philosophers 
did, 
and 
among 
others 
Diodorus 
in 
Cicero. 
The 
author 
confounds 
moral 
necessity, 
which 
proceeds 
from 
the 
choice 
of 
what 
is 
best 
with 
absolute 
necessity: 
he 
confounds 
the 
will 
of 
God, 
with 
his 
power. 
God 
can 
produce 
everything 
that 
is 
possible, 
or 
whatever 
does 
not 
imply 
a 
contradiction; 
but 
he 
wills 
only 
to 
produce 
what 
is 
the 
best 
among 
things 
possible. 
See 
what 
has 
been 
said 
above, 
Number 
9 
[and 
Number 
74.] 


77. 
God 
is 
not 
therefore 
a 
necessary 
agent 
in 
producing 
creatures, 
since 
he 
acts 
with 
choice. 
However, 
what 
the 
author 
adds 
here, 
is 
ill-grounded, 
viz. 
that 
a 
necessary 
agent 
would 
not 
be 
an 
agent 
at 
all. 
He 
frequently 
affirms 
things 
boldly, 
and 
without 
any 
ground; 
advancing 
[against 
me] 
notions 
which 
cannothe 
proved. 
To 
§24-28. 


78. 
The 
author 
alleges, 
it 
was 
not 
affirmed 
that 
space 
is 
God’s 
sensorium, 
but 
only 
as 
it 
were 
his 
sensorium. 
The 
latter 
seems 
to 
be 
as 
improper, 
and 
as 
little 
intelligible, 
astheformer. 
To§ 
29. 


79. 
Space 
is 
not 
the 
place 
of 
all 
things; 
for 
it 
is 
not 
the 
place 
of 
God. 
Otherwise 
there 
would 
be 
a 
thing 
co-eternal 
with 
God, 
and 
independent 
upon 
him;nay,hehimselfwoulddependupon 
it, 
ifhehasneedof 
place. 
80. 
Nor 
do 
I 
see, 
how 
it 
can 
be 
said, 
that 
space 
is 
the 
place 
of 
ideas; 
for 
ideas 
areinthe 
understanding. 
81. 
’Tis 
also 
very 
strange 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
soul 
of 
man 
is 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
images 
it 
perceives. 
The 
images, 
which 
are 
in 
the 
understanding, 
are 
in 
the 
mind:butifthe 
mindwasthesoul 
ofthe 
images,they 
wouldthen 
be 
extrinsic 
to 
it. 
And 
if 
the 
author 
means 
corporeal 
images, 
how 
then 
will 
he 
have 
a 

human 
mind 
to 
be 
the 
soul 
of 
those 
images, 
they 
being 
only 
transient 
impressionsin 
abody 
belonging 
tothat 
soul? 


82. 
If 
’tis 
by 
means 
of 
a 
sensorium, 
that 
God 
perceives 
what 
passes 
in 
the 
world; 
it 
seems 
that 
things 
act 
upon 
him; 
and 
that 
therefore 
he 
is 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
a 
soul 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
author 
charges 
me 
with 
repeating 
objections; 
without 
taking 
notice 
of 
the 
answers; 
but 
I 
don’t 
see 
that 
he 
has 
answered 
this 
difficulty. 
They 
had 
better 
wholly 
lay 
aside 
this 
pretended 
sensorium. 
To§ 
30. 


83. 
The 
author 
speaks, 
as 
if 
he 
did 
not 
understand, 
how, 
according 
to 
my 
opinion, 
the 
soul 
is 
a 
representative 
principle. 
Which 
is, 
as 
if 
he 
had 
never 
heardofmy 
pre-established 
harmony. 
84. 
I 
don’t 
assent 
to 
the 
vulgar 
notions, 
that 
the 
images 
of 
things 
are 
conveyed 
by 
the 
organs 
[of 
sense] 
to 
the 
soul. 
For, 
it 
is 
not 
conceivable 
by 
what 
passage, 
or 
by 
what 
means 
of 
conveyance, 
these 
images 
can 
be 
carried 
from 
the 
organ 
to 
the 
soul. 
This 
vulgar 
notion 
in 
philosophy 
is 
not 
intelligible, 
as 
the 
new 
Cartesians 
have 
sufficiently 
shown. 
It 
cannot 
he 
explained, 
how 
immaterial 
substance 
is 
affected 
by 
matter: 
and 
to 
maintain 
an 
unintelligible 
notion 
thereupon, 
is 
having 
recourse 
to 
the 
scholastic 
chimerical 
notion 
of 
I 
know 
not 
what 
inexplicable 
species 
intentionales, 
passing 
from 
the 
organs 
to 
the 
soul. 
Those 
Cartesians 
saw 
the 
difficulty; 
but 
they 
could 
not 
explain 
it. 
They 
had 
recourse 
to 
a 
[certain 
wholly 
special] 
concourse 
of 
God, 
which 
would 
really 
be 
miraculous. 
But, 
I 
think, 
I 
have 
given 
the 
true 
solution 
ofthat 
enigma. 
85. 
To 
say 
that 
God 
perceives 
what 
passes 
in 
the 
world, 
because 
he 
is 
present 
to 
the 
things, 
and 
not 
by 
[the 
dependence 
which 
the 
continuation 
of 
their 
existence 
has 
upon 
him 
and 
which 
may 
be 
said 
to 
involve] 
a 
continual 

production 
of 
them; 
is 
saying 
something 
unintelligible. 
A 
mere 
presence 
or 
proximity 
of 
co-existence, 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
make 
us 
understand, 
how 
that 
which 
passesin 
onebeing,shouldanswerto 
whatpassesin 
another. 


86. 
Besides; 
this 
is 
exactly 
falling 
into 
that 
opinion, 
which 
makes 
God 
to 
be 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
world; 
seeing 
it 
supposes 
God 
to 
perceive 
things, 
not 
by 
their 
dependence 
upon 
him, 
that 
is, 
by 
a 
continual 
production 
of 
what 
is 
good 
and 
perfect 
in 
them; 
but 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
perception, 
such 
as 
that 
by 
which 
men 
fancy 
our 
soul 
perceives 
what 
passes 
in 
the 
body. 
This 
is 
a 
degrading 
of 
God’s 
knowledgevery 
much. 
87. 
In 
truth 
and 
reality, 
this 
way 
of 
perception 
is 
wholly 
chimerical, 
and 
has 
no 
place 
even 
in 
human 
souls. 
They 
perceive 
what 
passes 
without 
them, 
by 
what 
passes 
within 
them, 
answering 
to 
the 
things 
without; 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
harmony, 
which 
God 
has 
preestablished 
by 
the 
most 
beautiful 
and 
the 
most 
admirable 
of 
all 
his 
productions; 
whereby 
every 
simple 
substance 
is 
by 
its 
nature 
(if 
one 
may 
so 
say), 
a 
concentration, 
and 
a 
living 
mirror 
of 
the 
whole 
universe, 
according 
to 
its 
point 
of 
view. 
Which 
is 
likewise 
one 
of 
the 
most 
beautiful 
and 
most 
undeniable 
proofs 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
God; 
since 
none 
but 
God, 
viz. 
theuniversalcause,can 
produce 
sucha 
harmonyofthings. 
ButGod 
himself 
cannot 
perceive 
things 
by 
the 
same 
means 
whereby 
he 
makes 
other 
beings 
perceive 
them. 
He 
perceives 
them, 
because 
he 
is 
able 
to 
produce 
that 
means. 
And 
other 
beings 
would 
not 
be 
caused 
to 
perceive 
them, 
if 
he 
himself 
did 
not 
produce 
them 
all 
harmonious, 
and 
had 
not 
therefore 
in 
himself 
a 
representation 
of 
them; 
not 
as 
if 
that 
representation 
came 
from 
the 
things, 
but 
because 
the 
things 
proceed 
from 
him, 
and 
because 
he 
is 
the 
efficient 
and 
exemplary 
cause 
of 
them. 
He 
perceives 
them, 
because 
they 
proceed 
from 
him; 
if 
one 
may 
be 
allowed 
to 
say, 
thathe 
perceives 
them: 
which 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
said, 
unless 
we 
divest 
that 
word 
of 
its 
imperfection; 
for 
else 
it 
seems 
to 
signify, 
that 
things 
act 
upon 
him. 
They 
exist, 
and 
are 
known 
to 
him, 
because 

he 
understands 
and 
wills 
them; 
and 
because 
what 
he 
wills, 
is 
the 
same, 
as 
what 
exists. 
Which 
appears 
so 
much 
the 
more, 
because 
he 
makes 
them 
to 
be 
perceived 
by 
one 
another; 
and 
makes 
them 
perceive 
one 
another 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
natures 
which 
he 
has 
given 
them 
once 
for 
all, 
and 
which 
hekeepsuponly 
according 
tothelawsof 
everyoneofthemseverally;which, 
though 
different 
one 
from 
another, 
yet 
terminate 
in 
an 
exact, 
correspondence 
of 
the 
results 
of 
the 
whole. 
This 
surpasses 
all 
the 
ideas, 
which 
men 
have 
generally 
framed 
concerning 
the 
divine 
perfections, 
and 
the 
works 
of 
God; 
and 
raises 
[our 
notion 
of 
] 
them, 
to 
the 
highest 
degree; 
as 
Mr. 
Bayle 
has 
acknowledged, 
though 
he 
believed, 
without 
any 
ground, 
that 
it 
exceeded 
possibility. 


88. 
To 
infer 
from 
that 
passage 
of 
Holy 
Scripture, 
wherein 
God 
is 
said 
to 
have 
rested 
from 
his 
works, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
continual 
production 
of 
them; 
would 
be 
to 
make 
a 
very 
ill 
use 
of 
that 
text. 
’Tis 
true, 
there 
is 
no 
production 
of 
new 
simple 
substances: 
but 
it 
would 
be 
wrong 
to 
infer 
from 
thence, 
that 
God 
is, 
now 
in 
the 
world, 
only 
as 
the 
soul 
is 
conceived 
to 
be 
in 
the 
body, 
governing 
it 
merely 
by 
his 
presence, 
without 
any 
concourse 
being 
necessarytocontinueitsexistence. 
To§ 
31. 


89. 
The 
harmony, 
or 
correspondence 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
is 
not 
a 
perpetual 
miracle; 
but 
the 
effect 
or 
consequence 
of 
an 
original 
miracle 
worked 
at 
the 
creation 
of 
things; 
as 
all 
natural 
things 
are. 
Though 
indeed 
it 
is 
a 
perpetual 
wonder, 
as 
manynatural 
thingsare. 
90. 
The 
word, 
pre-established 
harmony, 
is 
a 
term 
of 
art, 
I 
confess; 
but 
’tis 
not 
a 
term 
that 
explains 
nothing, 
since 
it 
is 
made 
out 
very 
intelligibly; 
and 
the 
authoralleges 
nothing,that 
showsthereisanydifficulty 
init. 

91. 
The 
nature 
of 
every 
simple 
substance, 
soul, 
or 
true 
monad, 
being 
such, 
that 
its 
following 
state 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
preceding 
one; 
here 
now 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
harmony 
found 
out. 
For 
God 
needs 
only 
to 
make 
a 
simple 
substance 
become 
once 
and 
from 
the 
beginning, 
a 
representation 
of 
the 
universe, 
according 
to 
its 
point 
of 
view, 
since 
from 
thence 
alone 
it 
follows, 
that 
it 
will 
be 
so 
perpetually; 
and 
that 
all 
simple 
substances 
will 
always 
have 
a 
harmony 
among 
themselves, 
because 
they 
always 
represent 
the 
same 
universe. 
To§ 
32. 


92. 
’Tis 
true, 
that, 
according 
to 
me, 
the 
soul 
does 
not 
disturb 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
body, 
northe 
body 
thoseof 
the 
soul;and 
that 
the 
soul 
and 
body 
do 
only 
agree 
together; 
the 
one 
acting 
freely, 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
final 
causes; 
and 
the 
other 
acting 
mechanically, 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
efficient 
causes. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
derogate 
fromthe 
libertyofour 
souls,as 
theauthorhere 
will 
have 
it. 
For, 
every 
agent 
which 
acts 
[with 
choice 
— 
Ger.] 
according 
to 
final 
causes, 
is 
free, 
though 
it 
happens 
to 
agree 
with 
an 
agent 
acting 
only 
by 
efficient 
causes 
without 
knowledge, 
or 
mechanically; 
because 
God, 
foreseeing 
what 
the 
free 
cause 
would 
do, 
did 
from 
the 
beginning 
regulate 
the 
machine 
in 
such 
manner,thatitcannotfailto 
agree 
withthatfreecause. 
Mr. 
Jaquelot 
has 
very 
wellresolvedthis 
difficulty,inoneofhisbooksagainst 
Mr. 
Bayle; 
and 
I 
have 
cited 
the 
passage, 
in 
my 
Theodicaea, 
Part 
I, 
§ 
63. 
I 
shall 
speak 
of 
it 
again 
below, 
Number 
124. 
To§ 
33. 


93. 
I 
don’t 
admit, 
that 
every 
action 
gives 
a 
new 
force 
to 
the 
patient. 
It 
frequently 
happens 
in 
the 
concourse 
of 
bodies, 
that 
each 
of 
them 
preserves 
its 
force; 
as 
whentwoequal 
hard 
bodies 
meet 
directly. 
Then 
the 
directiononly 
is 

changed, 
without 
any 
change 
in 
the 
force; 
each 
of 
the 
bodies 
receiving 
the 
directionof 
the 
other,andgoingback 
withthesame 
swiftness 
itcame. 


94. 
However, 
I 
am 
far 
from 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
supernatural 
to 
give 
a 
new 
force 
to 
a 
body; 
for 
I 
acknowledge 
that 
one 
body 
does 
frequently 
receive 
a 
new 
force 
from 
another, 
which 
loses 
as 
much 
of 
its 
own. 
But 
I 
say 
only, 
’tis 
supernatural 
that 
the 
whole 
universe 
of 
bodies 
should 
receive 
a 
new 
force; 
and 
consequently 
that 
one 
body 
should 
acquire 
any 
new 
force, 
without 
the 
loss 
of 
as 
much 
in 
others. 
And 
therefore 
I 
say 
likewise, 
’tis 
an 
indefensible 
opinion 
to 
suppose 
the 
soul 
gives, 
force 
to 
the 
body; 
for 
then 
the 
whole 
universe 
ofbodieswouldreceivea 
new 
force. 
95. 
The 
author’s 
dilemma 
here, 
is 
ill-grounded; 
viz. 
that 
according 
to 
me, 
either 
a 
man 
mustact 
supernaturally, 
or 
he 
a 
mere 
machine, 
like 
a 
watch. 
For, 
man 
does 
not 
act 
supernaturally: 
and 
his 
body 
is 
truly 
a 
machine, 
acting 
only 
mechanically; 
and 
yet 
his 
soul 
is 
afreecause. 
To§ 
34and 
35. 


96. 
I 
here 
refer 
to 
what 
has 
been 
or 
shall 
he 
said 
in 
this 
paper, 
Number 
82, 
86, 
[88] 
and 
111: 
concerning 
the 
comparison 
between 
God 
and 
a 
soul 
of 
the 
world; 
and 
how 
the 
opinion 
contrary 
to 
mine, 
brings 
the 
one 
of 
these 
too 
near 
totheother. 
To§ 
36. 


97. 
I 
here 
also 
refer 
to 
what 
I 
have 
before 
said, 
concerning 
the 
harmony 
between 
the 
soul 
and 
the 
body, 
Number89,&c. 
To§37. 


98. 
The 
author 
tells 
us, 
that 
the 
soul 
is 
not 
in 
the 
brain, 
but 
in 
the 
sensorium; 
without 
saying 
what 
that 
sensorium 
is. 
But 
supposing 
that 
sensorium 
to 
be 
extended, 
as 
I 
believe 
the 
author 
understands 
it; 
the 
same 

difficulty 
still 
remains, 
and 
the 
question 
returns, 
whether 
the 
soul 
be 
diffused 
through 
that 
whole 
extension, 
be 
it 
great 
or 
small. 
For, 
more 
or 
less 
in 
bigness,isnothingtothepurposehere. 


To§38. 


99. 
I 
don’t 
undertake 
here 
to 
establish 
my 
Dynamics, 
or 
my 
doctrine 
of 
forces: 
this 
would 
not 
be 
a 
proper 
place 
for 
it. 
However, 
I 
can 
very 
well 
answer 
the 
objection 
here 
brought 
against 
me. 
I 
have 
affirmed 
that 
active 
forces 
are 
preserved 
in 
the 
world 
[without 
diminution]. 
The 
author 
objects, 
that 
two 
soft 
or 
unelastic 
bodies 
meeting 
together, 
lose 
some 
of 
their 
force. 
I 
answer, 
no. 
’Tis 
true, 
their 
wholes 
lose 
it 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
total 
motion; 
but 
their 
parts 
receive 
it, 
being 
shaken 
[internally] 
by 
the 
force 
of 
the 
concourse. 
And 
therefore 
that 
loss 
of 
force, 
is 
only 
in 
appearance. 
The 
forces 
are 
not 
destroyed, 
but 
scattered 
among 
the 
small 
parts. 
The 
bodies 
do 
not 
lose 
their 
forces; 
but 
the 
case 
here 
is 
the 
same, 
as 
when 
men 
change 
great 
money 
into 
small. 
However, 
I 
agree 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
motion 
does 
not 
remain 
the 
same; 
and 
herein 
I 
approve 
what 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton 
says, 
page 
341 
of 
his 
Optics, 
which 
the 
author 
here 
quotes. 
But 
I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere, 
that 
there 
is 
adifferencebetweenthequantityof 
motion,and 
the 
quantityof 
force. 
To§ 
39. 


100. 
The 
author 
maintained 
against 
me, 
that 
force 
does 
naturally 
lessen 
in 
the 
material 
universe; 
and 
that 
this 
arises 
from 
the 
dependence 
of 
things, 
(Third 
Reply, 
§ 
13 
and 
14). 
In 
my 
third 
answer, 
I 
desired 
him 
to 
prove 
that 
this 
imperfection 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
dependence 
of 
things. 
He 
avoids 
answering 
my 
demand; 
by 
falling 
upon 
an 
incident, 
and 
denying 
this 
to 
be 
an 
imperfection. 
But 
whether 
it 
be 
an 
imperfection 
or 
not, 
he 
should 
have 
provedthat 
’tis 
aconsequenceofthedependenceofthings. 

101. 
However; 
that 
which 
would 
make 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
world 
as 
imperfect, 
as 
that 
of 
an 
unskillful 
watchmaker; 
surely 
must 
needs 
be 
an 
imperfection. 
102. 
The 
author 
says 
now, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
inertia 
of 
matter. 
But 
this 
also, 
he 
will 
not 
prove. 
That 
inertia, 
alleged 
here 
by 
him, 
mentioned 
by 
Kepler, 
repeated 
by 
Cartesius 
[in 
his 
letters], 
and 
made 
use 
of 
by 
me 
in 
my 
Theodicaea, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
a 
notion 
[and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
an 
example] 
of 
the 
natural 
imperfection 
of 
creatures; 
has 
no 
other 
effect, 
than 
to 
make 
the 
velocities 
diminish, 
when 
the 
quantities 
of 
matter 
are 
increased: 
but 
this 
is 
withoutany 
diminution 
of 
the 
forces. 
To§ 
40. 


103. 
I 
maintained, 
that 
the 
dependence 
of 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
world 
upon 
its 
divine 
author, 
is 
rather 
a 
reason 
why 
there 
can 
be 
no 
such 
imperfection 
in 
it; 
and 
that 
the 
work 
of 
God 
does 
not 
want 
to 
be 
set 
right 
again; 
that 
it 
is 
not 
liable 
to 
be 
disordered; 
and 
lastly, 
that 
it 
cannot 
lessen 
in 
perfection. 
Let 
any 
one 
guess 
now, 
how 
the 
author 
can 
hence 
infer 
against 
me, 
as 
he 
does, 
that, 
if 
this 
be 
the 
case, 
then 
the 
material 
world 
must 
be 
infinite 
and 
eternal, 
without 
any 
beginning; 
and 
that 
God 
must 
always 
have 
created 
as 
many 
men 
and 
otherkindsofcreatures,as 
can 
possibly 
hecreated. 
To§ 
41. 


104. 
I 
don’t 
say, 
that 
space 
is 
an 
order 
or 
situation, 
which 
makes, 
things 
capable 
of 
being 
situated: 
this 
would 
be 
nonsense. 
Any 
one 
needs 
only 
consider 
my 
own 
words, 
and 
add 
“them 
to 
what 
I 
said 
above, 
(Number 
47) 
in 
order 
to 
show 
how 
the 
mind 
comes 
to 
form 
to 
itself 
an 
idea 
of 
space, 
and 
yet 
that 
there 
needs 
not 
be 
any 
real 
and 
absolute 
being 
answering 
to 
that 
idea, 
distinctfrom 
themind, 
andfrom 
all 
relations. 
I 
don’t 
say 
therefore, 
that 
space 

is 
an 
order 
or 
situation, 
but 
an 
order 
of 
situations; 
or 
[an 
order] 
according 
to 
which, 
situations 
are 
disposed; 
and 
that 
abstract 
space 
is 
that 
order 
of 
situations, 
when 
they 
are 
conceived 
as 
being 
possible. 
Space 
is 
therefore 
something 
[merely] 
ideal. 
But, 
it 
seems, 
the 
author 
will 
not 
understand 
me. 
I 
have 
already, 
in 
this 
paper, 
(.Number 
54) 
answered 
the 
objection, 
that 
order 
is 
notcapableof 
quantity. 


105. 
The 
author 
objects 
here, 
that 
time 
cannot 
be 
an 
order 
of 
successive 
things, 
because 
the 
quantity 
of 
time 
may 
become 
greater 
or 
less, 
and 
yet 
the 
order 
of 
successions 
continue 
the 
same. 
I 
answer: 
this 
is 
not 
so. 
For 
if 
the 
time 
is 
greater, 
there 
will 
be 
more 
successive 
and 
like 
states 
interposed; 
and 
if 
it 
be 
less, 
there 
will 
be 
fewer; 
seeing 
there 
is 
no 
vacuum, 
nor 
condensation, 
norpenetration(ifI. 
may 
sospeak),in 
times, 
anymorethanin 
places. 
106. 
’Tis 
true, 
[I 
maintain 
that] 
the 
immensity 
and 
eternity 
of 
God 
would 
subsist, 
though 
there 
were 
no 
creatures; 
but 
those 
attributes 
would 
have 
no 
dependence 
either 
on 
times 
or 
places. 
If 
there 
were 
no 
creatures, 
there 
would 
be 
neither, 
time 
nor 
place, 
and 
consequently 
no 
actual 
space. 
The 
immensity 
of 
God 
is 
independent 
upon 
space, 
as 
his 
eternity 
is 
independent 
upon 
time. 
These 
attributes 
signify 
only 
[in 
respect 
to 
these 
two 
orders 
of 
things], 
that 
God 
would 
be 
present 
and 
co-existent 
with 
all 
the 
things 
that 
should 
exist. 
And 
therefore 
I 
don’t 
admit 
what’s 
here 
alleged, 
that 
if 
God 
existed 
alone, 
there 
would 
be 
time 
and 
space 
as 
there 
is 
now; 
whereas 
then, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
they 
would 
be 
only 
in 
the 
ideas 
of 
God 
as 
mere 
possibilities. 
The 
immensity 
and 
eternity 
of 
God 
are 
things 
more 
transcendent, 
than 
the 
duration 
and 
extension 
of 
creatures; 
not 
only 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
greatness, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
things. 
Those 
divine 
attributes 
do 
not 
imply 
the 
supposition 
of 
things 
extrinsic 
to 
God, 
such 
as 
are 
actual 
places 
and 
times. 
These 
truths 
have 
beensufficientlyacknowledgedby 
divines 
and 
philosophers. 
To§ 
42. 



107. 
I 
maintained, 
that 
an 
operation 
of 
God, 
by 
which 
he 
should 
mend 
the 
machine 
of 
the 
material 
world, 
tending 
in 
its 
nature 
(as 
this 
author 
pretends) 
to 
lose 
all 
its 
motion, 
would 
be 
a 
miracle. 
His 
answer 
was; 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
miraculous 
operation, 
because 
it 
would 
be 
usual, 
and 
must 
frequently 
happen. 
I 
replied; 
that 
’tis 
not 
usualness 
or 
unusualness, 
that 
makes 
a 
miracle 
properly 
so 
called, 
or 
a 
miracle 
of 
the 
highest 
sort; 
but 
its 
surpassing 
the 
powers 
of 
creatures; 
and 
that 
this 
is 
the 
[general] 
opinion 
of 
divines 
and 
philosophers: 
and 
that 
therefore 
the 
author 
acknowledges 
at 
least, 
that 
the 
thing 
he 
introduces, 
and 
I 
disallow, 
is, 
according 
to 
the 
received 
notion, 
a 
miracle 
of 
the 
highest 
sort, 
that 
is, 
one 
which 
surpasses 
all 
created 
powers: 
and 
that 
this 
is 
the 
very 
thing 
which 
all 
men 
endeavor 
to 
avoid 
in 
philosophy. 
He 
answers 
now, 
that 
this 
is 
appealing 
from 
reason 
to 
vulgar 
opinion. 
But 
I 
reply 
again, 
that 
this 
vulgar 
opinion, 
according 
to 
which 
we 
ought 
in 
philosophy 
to 
avoid, 
as 
much 
as 
possible, 
what 
surpasses 
the 
natures 
of 
creatures; 
is 
a 
very 
reasonable 
opinion. 
Otherwise 
nothing 
will 
be 
easier 
than 
to 
account 
for 
anything 
by 
bringing 
in 
the 
Deity, 
Deum 
ex 
machina, 
without 
mindingthe 
natures 
ofthings. 
108. 
Besides; 
the 
common 
opinion 
of 
divines, 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
looked 
upon 
merely 
as 
vulgar 
opinion. 
A 
man 
should 
have 
weighty 
reasons, 
before 
he 
ventures 
tocontradictit;and 
I 
seeno 
suchreasonshere. 
109. 
The 
author 
seems 
to 
depart 
from 
his 
own 
notion, 
according 
to 
which 
a 
miracle 
ought 
to 
be 
unusual; 
when, 
in 
§ 
31, 
he 
objects 
to 
me 
(though 
without 
any 
ground), 
that, 
the 
pre-established 
harmony 
would 
be 
a 
perpetual 
miracle. 
Here, 
I 
say, 
he 
seems 
to 
depart 
from 
his 
own 
notion; 
unless 
he 
had 
a 
mindto 
argueagainstme 
ad 
hominem. 
To§

If 
a 
miracle 
differs 
from 
what 
is 
natural, 
only 
in 
appearance 
and 
with 
respect 
to 
us; 
so 
that 
we 
call 
that 
only 
a 
miracle, 
which 
we 
seldom 
see; 
there 
will 
be 
no 
internal 
real 
difference, 
between 
a 
miracle 
and 
what 
is 
natural; 
and 
at 
the 
bottom, 
every 
thing 
will 
be 
either 
equally 
natural, 
or 
equally 
miraculous. 
Will 
divines 
likethe 
former,or 
philosophers 
thelatter? 
111. 
Will 
not 
this 
doctrine, 
moreover, 
tend 
to 
make 
God 
the 
soul 
of 
the 
world; 
if 
all 
his 
operations 
are 
natural, 
like 
those 
of 
our 
souls 
upon 
our 
bodies?AndsoGodwillbeapartof

112. 
In 
good 
philosophy, 
and 
sound 
theology, 
we 
ought 
to 
distinguish 
between 
what 
is 
explicable 
by 
the 
natures 
and 
powers 
of 
creatures, 
and 
what 
is 
explicable 
only 
by 
the 
powers 
of 
the 
infinite 
substance. 
We 
ought 
to 
make 
an 
infinite 
difference 
between 
the 
operation 
of 
God, 
which 
goes 
beyond 
the 
extent 
of 
natural 
powers; 
and 
the 
operations 
of 
things 
that 
follow 
the 
law 
which 
God 
has 
given 
them, 
and 
which 
he 
has 
enabled 
them 
to 
follow 
by 
their 
natural 
powers, 
thoughnotwithouthisassistance. 
113. 
This 
overthrows 
attractions, 
properly 
so 
called, 
and 
other 
operations 
inexplicable 
by 
the 
natural 
powers 
of 
creatures; 
which 
kinds 
of 
operations, 
the 
assertors 
of 
them 
must 
suppose 
to 
be 
effected 
by 
miracle; 
or 
else 
have 
recourse 
to 
absurdities, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
occult 
qualities 
of 
the 
schools; 
which 
some 
men 
begin 
to 
revive 
under 
the 
specious 
name 
of 
forces; 
but 
they 
bring 
us 
back 
again 
into 
the 
kingdom 
of 
darkness. 
This 
is, 
inventa 
fruge, 
glandibus 
vesci. 
114. 
In 
the 
time 
of 
Mr. 
Boyle, 
and 
other 
excellent 
men, 
who 
flourished 
in 
England 
under 
Charles 
the 
lid, 
nobody 
would 
have 
ventured 
to 
publish 
such 
chimerical 
notions. 
I 
hope 
that 
happy 
time 
will 
return 
under 
so 
good 
a 
government 
as 
the 
present 
[and 
that 
minds 
a 
little 
too 
much 
carried 
away 
by 
the 
misfortune 
of 
the 
times 
will 
betake 
themselves 
to 
the 
better 
cultivation 
of 
sound 
learning]. 
Mr. 
Boyle 
made 
it 
his 
chief 
business 
to 
inculcate, 
that 

everything 
was 
done 
mechanically 
in 
natural 
philosophy. 
But 
it 
is 
men’s 
misfortune 
to 
grow, 
at 
last, 
out 
of 
conceit 
with 
reason 
itself, 
and 
to 
be 
weary 
of 
light. 
Chimeras 
begin 
to 
appear 
again, 
and 
they 
are 
pleasing 
because 
they 
have 
something 
in 
them 
that 
is 
wonderful. 
What 
has 
happened 
in 
poetry, 
happens 
also 
in 
the 
philosophical 
world. 
People 
are 
grown 
weary 
of 
rational 
romances, 
such 
as 
were 
the 
French 
Clelia, 
or 
the 
German 
Aramene; 
and 
they 
arebecome 
fondagainofthe 
tales 
of 
fairies. 


115. 
As 
for 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
celestial 
bodies, 
and 
even 
the 
formation 
of 
plants 
and 
animals; 
there 
is 
nothing 
in 
them 
that 
looks 
like 
a 
miracle, 
except 
their 
beginning. 
The 
organism 
of 
animals 
is 
a 
mechanism, 
which 
supposes 
a 
divine 
preformation. 
What 
follows 
upon 
it, 
is 
purely 
natural, 
and 
entirely 
mechanical. 
116. 
Whatever 
is 
performed 
in 
the 
body 
of 
man, 
and 
of 
every 
animal, 
is 
no 
less 
mechanical, 
than 
what 
isperformedina 
watch. 
The 
difference 
is 
only 
such, 
as 
ought 
to 
be 
between 
a 
machine 
of 
divine 
invention,andtheworkmanship 
ofsuchalimitedartistas 
man 
is.

There 
is 
no 
difficulty 
among 
divines, 
about 
the 
miracles 
of 
angels. 
The 
question 
is 
only 
about 
the 
use 
of 
that 
word. 
It 
may 
he 
said 
that 
angels 
work 
miracles; 
but 
less 
properly 
so 
called, 
or 
of 
an 
inferior 
order. 
To 
dispute 
about 
this, 
would 
be 
a 
mere 
question 
about 
a 
word. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
angel, 
who 
carried 
Habakkuk 
through 
the 
air, 
and 
he 
who 
troubled 
the 
water 
of 
the 
pool 
of 
Bethesda, 
worked 
a 
miracle. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
a 
miracle 
of 
the 
highest 
order; 
for 
it 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
natural 
powers 
of 
angels, 
which 
surpass 
thoseofman. 
To§ 
45. 



118. 
I 
objected, 
that 
an 
attraction, 
properly 
so 
called, 
or 
in 
the 
scholastic 
sense, 
would 
be 
an 
operation 
at 
a 
distance, 
without 
any 
means 
intervening. 
The 
author 
answers 
here, 
that 
an 
attraction 
without 
any 
means 
intervening, 
would 
be 
indeed 
a 
contradiction. 
Very 
well! 
But 
then 
what 
does 
he 
mean, 
when 
he 
will 
have 
the 
sun 
to 
attract 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
earth 
through 
an 
empty 
space? 
Is 
it 
God 
himself 
that 
performs 
it? 
But 
this 
would 
be 
a 
miracle, 
if 
ever 
therewas 
any. 
Thiswouldsurelyexceedthepowersof 
creatures. 
119. 
Or, 
are 
perhaps 
some 
immaterial 
substances, 
or 
some 
spiritual 
rays, 
or 
some 
accident 
without 
a 
substance, 
or 
some 
kind 
of 
species 
intentionalis, 
or 
some 
other 
I 
know 
not 
what, 
the 
means 
by 
which 
this 
is 
pretended 
to 
be 
performed? 
Of 
which 
sort 
of 
things, 
the 
author 
seems 
to 
have 
still 
a 
good 
stockinhishead,withoutexplaining 
himself 
sufficiently. 
120. 
That 
means 
of 
communication 
(says 
he) 
is 
invisible, 
intangible, 
not 
mechanical. 
He 
might 
as 
well 
have 
added, 
inexplicable, 
unintelligible, 
precarious,groundless,and 
unexampled. 
121. 
But 
it 
is 
regular, 
(says 
the 
author), 
it 
is 
constant, 
and 
consequently 
natural. 
I 
answer; 
it 
cannot 
be 
regular, 
without 
being 
reasonable; 
nor 
natural, 
unless 
itcanbeexplainedbythenaturesof 
creatures. 
122. 
If 
the 
means, 
which 
causes 
an 
attraction 
properly 
so 
called, 
be 
constant, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
inexplicable 
by 
the 
powers 
of 
creatures, 
and 
yet 
be 
true; 
it 
must 
be 
a 
perpetual 
miracle: 
and 
if 
it 
is 
not 
miraculous, 
it 
is 
false. 
’Tisachimericalthing,ascholastic 
occult 
quality. 
123. 
The 
case 
would 
be 
the 
same, 
as 
in 
a 
body 
going 
round 
without 
receding 
in 
the 
tangent, 
though 
nothing 
that 
can 
be 
explained, 
hindered 
it 
from 
receding. 
Which 
is 
an 
instance 
I 
have 
already 
alleged; 
and 
the 
author 
has 
not 
thought 
fit 
to 
answer 
it, 
because 
it 
shows 
too 
clearly 
the 
difference 
between 
what 
is 
truly 
natural 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
and 
a 
chimerical 
occult 
quality 
oftheschoolson 
the 
other. 

To§

All 
the 
natural 
forces 
of 
bodies, 
are 
subject 
to 
mechanical 
laws; 
and 
all 
thenaturalpowersof 
spirits, 
aresubjectto 
moral 
laws. 
The 
former 
follow 
the 
order 
of 
efficient 
causes; 
and 
the 
latter 
follow 
the 
order 
of 
final 
causes. 
The 
former 
operate 
without 
liberty, 
like 
a 
watch; 
the 
latter 
operate 
with 
liberty, 
though 
they 
exactly 
agree 
with 
that 
machine, 
which 
another 
cause, 
free 
and 
superior, 
has 
adapted 
to 
them 
beforehand. 
I 
have 
already 
spoken 
of 
this, 
above, 
No. 
92. 
125. 
I 
shall 
conclude 
with 
what 
the 
author 
objected 
against 
me 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
fourth 
reply: 
to 
which 
I 
have 
already 
given 
an 
answer 
above 
(Number 
18, 
19, 
20). 
But 
I 
deferred 
speaking 
more 
fully 
upon 
that 
head, 
to 
the 
conclusion 
of 
this 
paper. 
He 
pretended, 
that 
I 
have 
been 
guilty 
of 
a 
petitio 
principii. 
But, 
of 
what 
principle, 
I 
beseech 
you? 
Would 
to 
God, 
less 
clear 
principles 
had 
never 
been 
laid 
down. 
The 
principle 
in 
question, 
is 
the 
principleof 
the 
want 
of 
a 
sufficient 
reason; 
in 
order 
to 
any 
thing’s 
existing, 
in 
order 
to 
any 
event’s 
happening, 
in 
order 
to 
any 
truth’s 
taking 
place. 
Is 
this 
a 
principle, 
that 
wants 
to 
be 
proved? 
The 
author 
granted 
it, 
or 
pretended 
to 
grantit, 
Number 
2, 
of 
his 
third 
paper; 
possibly,becausethe 
denialofitwould 
have 
appeared 
too 
unreasonable. 
But 
either 
he 
has 
done 
it 
only 
in 
words, 
or 
hecontradicts 
himself,orretractshisconcession. 
126. 
I 
dare 
say, 
that 
without 
this 
great 
principle, 
one 
cannot 
prove 
the 
existenceofGod,noraccountformany 
other 
importanttruths. 
127. 
Has 
not 
everybody 
made 
use 
of 
this 
principle, 
upon 
a 
thousand 
occasions. 
’Tis 
true, 
it 
has 
been 
neglected, 
out 
of 
carelessness, 
on 
many 
occasions: 
but 
that 
neglect 
has 
been 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
chimeras; 
such 
as 
are 
(for 
instance), 
an 
absolute 
real 
time 
or 
space, 
a 
vacuum, 
atoms, 
attraction 
in 
the 
scholastic 
sense, 
a 
physical 
influence 
of 
the 
soul 
over 
the 
body, 
and 
a 

thousand 
other 
fictions, 
either 
derived 
from 
erroneous 
opinions 
of 
the 
ancients,orlatelyinventedby 
modern 
philosophers. 


128. 
Was 
it 
not 
upon 
account 
of 
Epicurus’s 
violating 
this 
great 
principle, 
that 
the 
ancients 
derided 
his 
groundless 
declination 
of 
atoms? 
And 
I 
dare 
say,

scholastic 
attraction,

in 
our 
days, 
and

derided 
about 
thirty 
yearsago,isnotatallmorereasonable.

I 
have 
often 
defied 
people 
to 
allege 
an 
instance 
against 
that 
great 
principle, 
to 
bring 
any 
one 
uncontested 
example 
wherein 
it 
fails. 
But 
they 
have 
never 
done 
it, 
nor 
ever 
will. 
’Tis 
certain, 
there 
is 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
instances, 
wherein 
it 
succeeds, 
[or 
rather 
it 
succeeds] 
in 
all 
the 
known 
cases 
in 
which 
it 
has 
been 
made 
use 
of. 
From 
whence 
one 
may 
reasonably 
judge, 
that 
it 
will 
succeed 
also 
in 
unknown 
cases, 
or 
in 
such 
cases 
as 
can 
only 
by 
its 
means 
become 
known: 
according 
to 
the 
method 
of 
experimental 
philosophy, 
which 
proceeds 
a 
posteriori; 
though 
the 
principle 
were 
not 
perhaps 
otherwise 
justified 
bybarereason,or 
a 
priori. 
130. 
To 
deny 
this 
great 
principle, 
is 
likewise 
to 
do 
as 
Epicurus 
did; 
who 
was 
reduced 
to 
deny 
that 
other 
great 
principle, 
viz. 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction;whichis, 
thateveryintelligibleenunciationmustbeeither 
true, 
or 
false. 
Chrysippus 
undertook 
to 
prove 
that 
principle 
against 
Epicurus; 
but 
I 
think 
I 
need 
not 
imitate 
him. 
I 
have 
already 
said, 
what 
is 
sufficient 
to 
justify 
mine: 
and 
I 
might 
say 
something 
more 
upon 
it; 
but 
perhaps 
it 
would 
be 
too 
abstrusefor 
this 
present 
dispute. 
And, 
Ibelieve, 
reasonableand 
impartialmen 
will 
grant 
me, 
that 
having 
forced 
an 
adversary 
to 
deny 
that 
principle, 
is 
reducinghim 
ad 
absurdum.

DISTINGUISHED 
SIR, 
— 


Among 
your 
other 
merits 
spread 
abroad 
by 
fame, 
I 
understand 
that 
you 
have 
remarkable 
skill 
in 
optics. 
I 
have, 
therefore, 
wished 
to 
forward 
my 
essay, 
such 
as 
it 
is, 
to 
you, 
as 
I 
am 
not 
likely 
to 
find 
a 
better 
critic 
in 
this 
branch 
of 
learning. 
The 
paper, 
which 
I 
send 
you, 
and 
which 
I 
have 
styled 
“a 
note 
on 
advanced 
optics,” 
has 
been 
published 
with 
the 
view 
of 
more 
conveniently 
making 
known 
my 
ideas 
to 
my 
friends 
and 
the 
curious 
in 
such 
matters. 
I 
hearthat 
**** 
* 
is 
veryclever 
in 
the 
samesubject,doubtless 
heis 
wellknowntoyou. 
Ifyoucouldobtainformehisopinionandkind 
attention, 
you 
wouldgreatly 
increasemyobligationtoyou. 
Thepaper 
explainsitself. 


I 
believe 
you 
have 
already 
received 
the 
“Prodromo” 
of 
Francis 
Lana 
the 
Jesuit, 
written 
in 
Italian. 
Some 
remarkable 
observations 
on 
optics 
are 
contained 
in 
it. 
John 
Oltius 
too, 
a 
young 
Swiss 
very 
learned 
in 
these 
matters, 
haspublished 
“Physico-MechanicalReflectionsconcerningVision;” 
in 
which 
he 
announces 
a 
machine 
for 
the 
polishing 
all 
kinds 
of 
glasses, 
very 
simple 
and 
of 
universal 
applicability, 
and 
also 
declares 
that 
he 
has 
discovered 
a 
means 
of 
collecting 
all 
the 
rays 
coming 
from 
different 
points 
of 
an 
object, 
so 
as 
to 
obtain 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
corresponding 
points, 
but 
only 
under 
conditionsofagivendistanceandformof 
object. 


My 
proposal 
is, 
not 
that 
the 
rays 
from 
all 
points 
should 
be 
collected 
and 
re-arranged 
(this 
is 
with 
any 
object 
or 
distance 
impossible 
at 
the 
present 
stage 
of 
our 
knowledge); 
the 
result 
I 
aim 
at 
is 
the 
equal 
collection 
of 
rays 
from 
points 
outside 
the 
optic 
axis 
and 
in 
the 
optic 
axis, 
so 
that 
the 
apertures 
of 



glasses 
could 
be 
made 
of 
any 
size 
desired 
without 
impairing 
the 
distinctness 
of 
vision. 
But 
this 
must 
stand 
according 
to 
your 
skilled 
verdict.

[Answer

MostlearnedanddistinguishedSir, 
— 


I 
have 
read 
the 
paper 
you 
were 
kind 
enough 
to 
send 
me, 
and 
return 
you 
many 
thanks 
for 
the 
communication. 
I 
regret 
that 
I 
have 
not 
been 
able 
quite 
to 
follow 
your 
meaning, 
though 
you 
explain 
it 
sufficiently 
clearly, 
whether 
you 
think 
that 
there 
is 
any 
cause 
for 
making 
the 
apertures 
of 
the 
glasses 
small, 
except 
that 
the 
rays 
coming 
from 
a 
single 
point 
are 
not 
collected 
accurately 
at 
another 
single 
point, 
but 
in 
a 
small 
area 
which 
we 
generally 
call 
the 
mechanical 
point, 
and 
that 
this 
small 
area 
is 
greater 
or 
less 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
aperture. 
Further, 
I 
ask 
whether 
the 
lenses 
which 
you 
call 
“pandochæ” 
correct 
this 
fault, 
so 
that 
the 
mechanical 
point 
or 
small 
area, 
on 
which 
the 
rays 
coming 
from 
a 
single 
point 
are 
after 
refraction 
collected, 
always 
preserves 
the 
same 
proportional 
size, 
whether 
the 
aperture 
be 
small 
or 
large. 
If 
so, 
one 
may 
enlarge 
the 
aperture 
as 
much 
as 
one 
likes, 
and 
consequently 
these 
lenses 
will 
be 
far 
superior 
to 
those 
of 
any 
other 
shape 
known 
to 
me; 
if 
not, 
I 
hardly 
see 
why 
you 
praise 
them 
so 
greatly 
beyond 
common 
lenses. 
For 
circularlenses 
haveeverywhere 
the 
same 
axis; 
therefore, 
when 
we 
employ 
them, 
we 
must 
regard 
all 
the 
points 
of 
an 
object 
as 
placed 
in 
the 
optic 
axis; 
although 
all 
the 
points 
of 
the 
object 
be 
not 
at 
the 
same 
distance, 
the 
difference 
arising 
thence 
will 
not 
be 
perceptible, 
when 
the 
objects 
are 
very 
remote; 
because 
then 
the 
rays 
coming 
from 
a 
single 
point 
would, 
as 
they 
enter 
the 
glass, 
be 
regarded 
as 
parallel. 
I 
think 
your 
lenses 



might 
be 
of 
service 
in 
obtaining 
a 
more 
distinct 
representation 
of 
all 
the 
objects, 
when 
we 
wish 
to 
include 
several 
objects 
in 
one 
view, 
as 
we 
do, 
when 
we 
employ 
very 
large 
convex 
circular 
lenses. 
However, 
I 
would 
rather 
suspend 
my 
judgment 
about 
all 
these 
details, 
till 
you 
have 
more 
clearly 
explained 
your 
meaning, 
as 
I 
heartily 
beg 
you 
to 
do. 
I 
have, 
as 
you 
requested, 
sent 
the 
other 
copy 
of 
your 
paper 
to 
Mr. 
* 
* 
*

He 
answers, 
that

I 
have 
not

seen 
the 
“Prodromo” 
of 
Francis 
Lana, 
nor 
the 
“Physico-
Mechanical

John

What 
I 
more 
regret 
is, 
that 
your 
“Physical

has 
not 
yet 
come 
to 
my 
hands, 
nor 
is 
there 
a

for

here 
at 
the

The 
gift, 
therefore, 
which 
you 
so 
liberally 
promise 
me 
will 
be 
most 
acceptable 
to 
me; 
if 
I 
can 
be

you

I

PREFACE. 



MY 
EXPECTATIONS 
IN 
this 
small 
performance 
may 
seem 
somewhat 
extraordinary, 
when 
I 
declare 
that 
my 
intentions 
are 
to 
render 
a 
larger 
work 
more 
intelligible 
to 
ordinary 
capacities, 
by 
abridging 
it. 
’Tis 
however 
certain, 
that 
those 
who 
are 
not 
accustomed 
to 
abstract 
reasoning, 
are 
apt 
to 
lose 
the 
thread 
of 
argument, 
where 
it 
is 
drawn 
out 
to 
a 
great 
length, 
and 
each 
part 
fortified 
with 
all 
the 
arguments, 
guarded 
against 
all 
the 
objections, 
and 
illustrated 
with 
all 
the 
views, 
which 
occur 
to 
a 
writer 
in 
the 
diligent 
survey 
of 
his 
subject. 
Such 
Readers 
will 
more 
readily 
apprehend 
a 
chain 
of 
reasoning, 
that 
is 
more 
single 
and 
concise, 
where 
the 
chief 
propositions 
only 
are 
linkt 
on 
to 
each 
other, 
illustrated 
by 
some 
simple 
examples, 
and 
confirmed 
by 
a 
few 
of 
the 
more 
forcible 
arguments. 
The 
parts 
lying 
nearer 
together 
can 
better 
be 
compared, 
and 
the 
connexion 
be 
more 
easily 
traced 
from 
the 
first 
principles 
tothelastconclusion. 


THE 
work, 
of 
which 
I 
here 
present 
the 
Reader 
with 
an 
abstract, 
has 
been 
complained 
of 
as 
obscure 
and 
difficult 
to 
be 
comprehended, 
and 
I 
am 
apt 
to 
think, 
that 
this 
proceeded 
as 
much 
from 
the 
length 
as 
from 
the 
abstractedness 
of 
the 
argument. 
If 
I 
have 
remedy’d 
this 
inconvenience 
in 
any 
degree, 
I 
have 
attain’d 
my 
end. 
The 
book 
seem’d 
to 
me 
to 
have 
such 
an 
air 
of 
singularity, 
and 
novelty 
as 
claim’d 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
public; 
especially 
if 
it 
be 
found, 
as 
the 
Author 
seems 
to 
insinuate, 
that 
were 
his 
philosophy 
receiv’d, 
we 
must 
alter 
from 
the 
foundation 
the 
greatest 
part 
of 
the 
sciences. 
Such 
bold 
attempts 
are 
always 
advantageous 
in 
the 
republic 
of 
letters, 
because 
they 
shake 
off 
the 
yoke 
of 
authority, 
accustom 
men 
to 
think 
for 
themselves, 
give 
new 
hints, 



which 
men 
of 
genius 
may 
carry 
further, 
and 
by 
the 
very 
opposition, 
illustrate 
points,wherein 
noone 
beforesuspectedanydifficulty. 


THE 
Author 
must 
be 
contented 
to 
wait 
with 
patience 
for 
some 
time 
before 
the 
learned 
world 
can 
agree 
in 
their 
sentiments 
of 
his 
performance. 
’Tis 
his 
misfortune, 
that 
he 
cannot 
make 
an 
appeal 
to 
the 
people, 
who 
in 
all 
matters 
of 
common 
reason 
and 
eloquence 
are 
found 
so 
infallible 
a 
tribunal. 
He 
must 
be 
judg’d 
by 
the 
FEW, 
whose 
verdict 
is 
more 
apt 
to 
be 
corrupted 
by 
partiality 
and 
prejudice, 
especially 
as 
no 
one 
is 
a 
proper 
judge 
in 
these 
subjects, 
who 
hasnot 
often 
thought 
ofthem; 
and 
such 
are 
apt 
to 
formtothemselvessystems 
of 
their 
own, 
which 
they 
resolve 
not 
to 
relinquish. 
I 
hope 
the 
Author 
will 
excuse 
me 
for 
intermeddling 
in 
this 
affair, 
since 
my 
aim 
is 
only 
to 
encrease 
his 
auditory, 
by 
removing 
some 
difficulties, 
which 
have 
kept 
many 
from 
apprehendinghismeaning. 


Ihavechosenonesimpleargument,whichIhavecarefully 
tracedfromthe 
beginning 
to 
the 
end. 
This 
is 
the 
only 
point 
I 
have 
taken 
care 
to 
finish. 
The 
rest 
is 
only 
hints 
of 
particular 
passages, 
which 
seem’d 
to 
me 
curious 
and 
remarkable. 



AN 
ABSTRACTOF 
A 
BOOK 
LATELY 
PUBLISHED, 
ENTITULED, 
ATREATISE 
OFHUMAN 
NATURE, 
&C. 



THIS 
BOOK 
SEEMS 
to 
be 
wrote 
upon 
the 
same 
plan 
with 
several 
other 
works 
that 
have 
had 
a 
great 
vogue 
of 
late 
years 
in 
England. 
The 
philosophical 
spirit, 
which 
has 
been 
so 
much 
improved 
all 
over 
Europe 
within 
these 
last 
fourscore 
years, 
has 
been 
carried 
to 
as 
great 
a 
length 
in 
this 
kingdom 
as 
in 
any 
other. 
Our 
writers 
seem 
even 
to 
have 
started 
a 
new 
kind 
of 
philosophy, 
which 
promises 
more 
both 
to 
the 
entertainment 
and 
advantage 
of 
mankind, 
than 
any 
other 
with 
which 
the 
world 
has 
been 
yet 
acquainted. 
Most 
of 
the 
philosophers 
of 
antiquity, 
who 
treated 
of 
human 
nature, 
have 
shewn 
more 
of 
a 
delicacy 
of 
sentiment, 
a 
just 
sense 
of 
morals, 
or 
a 
greatness 
of 
soul, 
than 
a 
depth 
of 
reasoning 
and 
reflection. 
They 
content 
themselves 
with 
representing 
the 
common 
sense 
of 
mankind 
in 
the 
strongest 
lights, 
and 
with 
the 
best 
turn 
of 
thought 
and 
expression, 
without 
following 
out 
steadily 
a 
chain 
of 
propositions, 
or 
forming 
the 
several 
truths 
into 
a 
regular 
science. 
But 
’tis 
at 
least 
worth 
while 
to 
try 
if 
the 
science 
of 
man 
will 
not 
admit 
of 
the 
same 
accuracy 
which 
several 
parts 
of 
natural 
philosophy 
are 
found 
susceptible 
of. 
There 
seems 
to 
beall 
the 
reason 
in 
the 
worldto 
imagine 
that 
it 
may 
becarried 
to 
the 
greatest 
degree 
of 
exactness. 
If, 
in 
examining 
several 
phaenomena, 
we 
find 
that 
they 
resolve 
themselves 
into 
one 
common 
principle, 
and 
can 
trace 
this 
principle 
into 
another, 
we 
shall 
at 
last 
arrive 
at 
those 
few 
simple 
principles, 
on 
which 
all 
the 
rest 
depend. 
And 
tho’ 
we 
can 
never 
arrive 
at 
the 
ultimate 
principles, 
’tis 
a 
satisfaction 
to 
go 
as 
far 
as 
our 
faculties 
will 
allow 
us. 


THIS 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
the 
aim 
of 
our 
late 
philosophers, 
and, 
among 
the 
rest, 
of 
this 
author. 
He 
proposes 
to 
anatomize 
human 
nature 
in 
a 
regular 



manner, 
and 
promises 
to 
draw 
no 
conclusions 
but 
where 
he 
is 
authorized 
by 
experience. 
He 
talks 
with 
contempt 
of 
hypotheses; 
and 
insinuates, 
that 
such 
of 
our 
countrymen 
as 
have 
banished 
them 
from 
moral 
philosophy, 
have 
done 
a 
more 
signal 
service 
to 
the 
world, 
than 
my 
Lord 
Bacon, 
whom 
he 
considers 
as 
the 
father 
of 
experimental 
physicks. 
He 
mentions, 
on 
this 
occasion, 
Mr. 
Locke, 
my 
Lord 
Shaftsbury, 
Dr. 
Mandeville, 
Mr. 
Hutchison, 
Dr. 
Butler, 
who, 
tho’ 
they 
differ 
in 
many 
points 
among 
themselves, 
seem 
all 
to 
agree 
in 
founding 
their 
accurate 
disquisitions 
of 
human 
nature 
intirely 
upon 
experience. 


BESIDE 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
being 
acquainted 
with 
what 
most 
nearly 
concerns 
us, 
it 
may 
be 
safely 
affirmed, 
that 
almost 
all 
the 
sciences 
are 
comprehended 
in 
the 
science 
of 
human 
nature, 
and 
are 
dependent 
on 
it. 
The 
sole 
end 
of 
logic 
is 
to 
explain 
the 
principles 
and 
Operations 
of 
our 
reasoning 
faculty, 
and 
thenatureof 
ourideas; 
moralsand 
criticismregard 
our 
tastes 
and 
sentiments; 
and 
politics 
consider 
men 
as 
united 
in 
society, 
and 
dependent 
on 
each 
other. 
This 
treatise 
therefore 
of 
human 
nature 
seems 
intended 
for 
a 
system 
of 
the 
sciences. 
The 
author 
has 
finished 
what

and 
has 
laid 
thefoundationoftheotherpartsinhisaccountofthepassions. 


THE 
celebrated 
Monsieur 
Leibnitz 
has 
observed 
it 
to 
be 
a 
defect 
in 
the 
common 
systems 
of 
logic, 
that 
they 
are 
very 
copious 
when 
they 
explain 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
understanding 
in 
the 
forming 
of 
demonstrations, 
but 
are 
too 
concise 
when 
they 
treat 
of 
probabilities, 
and 
those 
other 
measures 
of 
evidence 
on 
which 
life 
and 
action 
intirely 
depend, 
and 
which 
are 
our 
guides 
even 
in 
most 
of 
our 
philosophical 
speculations. 
In 
this 
censure, 
he 
comprehends 
the 
essay 
on 
human 
understanding, 
le 
recherche 
de 
la 
verité, 
and 
l’art 
de 
penser. 
The 
author 
of 
the 
treatise 
of 
human 
nature 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
sensible 
of 
this 
defect 
in 
these 
philosophers, 
and 
has 
endeavoured, 
as 
much 
as 
he 
can, 
to 
supply 
it. 
As 
his 
book 
contains 
a 
great 
number 
of 



speculationsverynew 
andremarkable,itwillbeimpossibletogive 
thereader 
a 
just 
notion 
of 
the 
whole. 
We 
shall 
therefore 
chiefly 
confine 
ourselves 
to 
his 
explication 
of 
our 
reasonings 
from 
cause 
and 
effect. 
If 
we 
can

this 
intelligibletothe

OUR 
author 
begins 
with 
some 
definitions. 
He 
calls 
a 
perception 
whatever 
can 
be 
present 
to 
the 
mind, 
whether 
we 
employ 
our 
senses, 
or 
are 
actuated 
with 
passion, 
or 
exercise 
our 
thought 
and 
reflection. 
He 
divides 
our 
perceptions 
into 
two 
kinds, 
viz. 
impressions 
and 
ideas. 
When 
we 
feel 
a 
passion 
or 
emotion 
of 
any 
kind, 
or 
have 
the 
images 
of 
external 
objects 
conveyed 
by 
our 
senses; 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
what 
he 
calls 
an 
impression, 
which 
is 
a 
word 
that 
he 
employs 
in 
a 
new 
sense. 
When 
we 
reflect 
on 
a 
passion 
or 
an 
object 
which 
is 
not 
present, 
this 
perception 
is 
an 
idea. 
Impressions, 
therefore, 
are 
our 
lively 
and 
strong 
perceptions; 
ideas 
are 
the 
fainter 
and 
weaker. 
This 
distinction 
is 
evident; 
as 
evident 
as 
that 
betwixt 
feelingandthinking. 


THE 
first 
proposition 
he 
advances, 
is, 
that 
all 
our 
ideas, 
or 
weak 
perceptions, 
are 
derived 
from 
our 
impressions, 
or 
strong 
perceptions, 
and 
that 
we 
can 
never 
think 
of 
any 
thing 
which 
we 
have 
not 
seen 
without 
us, 
or 
felt 
in 
our 
own 
minds. 
This 
proposition 
seems 
to 
be 
equivalent 
to 
that 
which 
Mr. 
Locke 
has 
taken 
such 
pains 
to 
establish, 
viz. 
that 
no 
ideas 
are 
innate. 
Only 
it 
may 
be 
observed, 
as 
an 
inaccuracy 
of 
that 
famous 
philosopher, 
that 
he 
comprehends 
all 
our 
perceptions 
under 
the 
term 
of 
idea, 
in 
which 
sense 
it 
is 
false, 
that 
we 
have 
no 
innate 
ideas. 
For 
it 
is 
evident 
our 
stronger 
perceptions 
or 
impressions 
are 
innate, 
and 
that 
natural 
affection, 
love 
of 
virtue, 
resentment, 
and 
all 
the 
other 
passions, 
arise 
immediately 
from 
nature. 
I 
am 
perswaded, 
whoever 
would 
take 
the 
question 
in 
this 
light, 
would 
be 
easily 
able 
to 
reconcile 
all 
parties. 
Father 
Malebranche 
would 
find 
himself 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
point 
out 
any 
thought 
of 
the 
mind, 
which 
did 
not 
represent 
something 



antecedently 
felt 
by 
it, 
either 
internally, 
or 
by 
means 
of 
the 
external 
senses, 
and 
must 
allow, 
that 
however 
we 
may 
compound, 
and 
mix, 
and 
augment, 
and 
diminish 
our 
ideas, 
they 
are 
all 
derived 
from 
these 
sources. 
Mr. 
Locke, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
would 
readily 
acknowledge, 
that 
all 
our 
passions 
are 
a 
kind 
of 
natural 
instincts, 
derived 
from 
nothing 
but 
the 
original 
constitution 
of 
the 
humanmind. 


OURauthor 
thinks, 


“that 
no 
discovery 
could 
have 
been 
made 
more 
happily 
for 
deciding 
all 
controversies 
concerning 
ideas 
than 
this, 
that 
impressions 
always 
take 
the 
precedency 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
every 
idea 
with 
which 
the 
imagination 
is 
furnished, 
first 
makes 
its 
appearance 
in 
a 
correspondent 
impression. 
These 
latter 
perceptions 
are 
all 
so 
clear 
and 
evident, 
that 
they 
admit 
of 
no 
controversy; 
tho’ 
many 
of 
our 
ideas 
are 
so 
obscure, 
that 
’tis 
almost 
impossible 
even 
for 
the 
mind, 
which 
forms 
them, 
to 
tell 
exactly 
their 
nature 
and 
composition.” 


Accordingly, 
wherever 
any 
idea 
is 
ambiguous, 
he 
has 
always 
recourse 
to 
the 
impression, 
which 
must 
render 
it 
clear 
and 
precise. 
And 
when 
he 
suspects 
that 
any 
philosophical 
term 
has 
no 
idea 
annexed 
to 
it 
(as 
is 
too 
common) 
he 
always 
asks 
from 
what 
impression 
that 
idea 
is 
derived? 
And 
if 
no 
impression 
can 
be 
produced, 
he 
concludes 
that 
the 
term 
is 
altogether 
insignificant. 
’Tis 
after 
this 
manner 
he 
examines 
our 
idea 
of 
substance 
and 
essence; 
and 
it 
were 
to 
be 
wished, 
that 
this 
rigorous 
method 
were 
more 
practised 
in 
all 
philosophicaldebates. 


‘TIS 
evident, 
that 
all 
reasonings 
concerning 
matter 
of 
fact 
are 
founded 
on 
the 
relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect, 
and 
that 
we 
can 
never 
infer 
the 
existence 
of 
one 
object 
from 
another, 
unless 
they 
be 
connected 
together, 
either 
mediately 
orimmediately. 
In 
order 
therefore 
tounderstand 
these 
reasonings, 
we 
mustbe 



perfectly 
acquainted 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
cause; 
and 
in 
order 
to 
that, 
must 
look 
aboutusto 
findsomethingthat 
isthecauseofanother. 


HERE 
is 
a 
billiard-ball 
lying 
on 
the 
table, 
and 
another 
ball 
moving 
towards 
it 
with 
rapidity. 
They 
strike; 
and 
the 
ball, 
which 
was 
formerly 
at 
rest, 
now 
acquires 
a 
motion. 
This 
is 
as 
perfect 
an 
instance 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
as 
any 
which 
we 
know, 
either 
by 
sensation 
or 
reflection. 
Let 
us 
therefore 
examine 
it. 
’Tis 
evident, 
that 
the 
two 
balls 
touched 
one 
another 
before 
the 
motion 
was 
communicated, 
and 
that 
there 
was 
no 
interval 
betwixt 
the 
shock 
and 
the 
motion. 
Contiguity 
in 
time 
and 
place 
is 
therefore 
a 
requisite 
circumstance 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
all 
causes. 
’Tis 
evident 
likewise, 
that 
the 
motion, 
which 
was 
the 
cause, 
is 
prior 
to 
the 
motion, 
which 
was 
the 
effect. 
Priority 
in 
time, 
is 
therefore 
another 
requisite 
circumstance 
in 
every 
cause. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
all. 
Let 
us 
try 
any 
other 
balls 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
in 
a 
like 
situation, 
and 
we 
shall 
always 
find, 
that 
the 
impulse 
of 
the 
one 
produces 
motion 
in 
the 
other. 
Here 
therefore 
is 
a 
third 
circumstance, 
viz. 
that 
of 
a 
constant 
conjunction 
betwixt 
the 
cause 
and 
effect. 
Every 
object 
like 
the 
cause, 
produces 
always 
some 
object 
like 
the 
effect. 
Beyond 
these 
three 
circumstances 
of 
contiguity, 
priority, 
and 
constant 
conjunction, 
I 
can 
discover 
nothing 
in 
this 
cause. 
The 
first 
ball 
is 
in 
motion; 
touches 
the 
second; 
immediately 
the 
second 
is 
in 
motion: 
and 
when 
I 
try 
the 
experiment 
with 
the 
same 
or 
like 
balls, 
in 
the 
same 
or 
like 
circumstances, 
I 
find, 
that 
upon 
the 
motion 
and 
touch 
of 
the 
one 
ball, 
motion 
always 
follows 
in 
the 
other. 
In 
whatever 
shape 
I 
turn 
this 
matter, 
and 
however 
I 
examine 
it, 
I 
can 
find 
nothingfarther. 


THIS 
is 
the 
case 
when 
both 
the 
cause 
and 
effect 
are 
present 
to 
the 
senses. 
Let 
us 
now 
see 
upon 
what 
our 
inference 
is 
founded, 
when 
we 
conclude 
from 
the 
one 
that 
the 
other 
has 
existed 
or 
will 
exist. 
Suppose 
I 
see 
a 
ball 
moving 
in 
a 
streight 
line 
towards 
another, 
I 
immediately 
conclude, 
that 
they 
will 
shock, 



and 
that 
the 
second 
will 
be 
in 
motion. 
This 
is 
the 
inference 
from 
cause 
to 
effect; 
and 
of 
this 
nature 
are 
all 
our 
reasonings 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
life: 
on 
his 
is 
founded 
all 
our 
belief 
in 
history: 
and 
from 
hence 
is 
derived 
all 
philosophy, 
excepting 
only 
geometry 
and 
arithmetic. 
If 
we 
can 
explain 
the 
inference 
from 
the 
shock 
of 
two 
balls, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
account 
for 
this 
operation 
of 
the 
mindin 
all 
instances. 


WERE 
a 
man, 
such 
as 
Adam, 
created 
in 
the 
full 
vigour 
of 
understanding, 
without 
experience, 
he 
would 
never 
be 
able 
to 
infer 
motion 
in 
the 
second 
ball 
from 
the 
motionand 
impulse 
of 
the 
first. 
It 
is 
not 
any 
thing 
that 
reasonseesin 
the 
cause, 
which 
make 
us 
infer 
the 
effect. 
Such 
an 
inference, 
were 
it 
possible, 
would 
amount 
to 
a 
demonstration, 
as 
being 
founded 
merely 
on 
the 
comparison 
of 
ideas. 
But 
no 
inference 
from 
cause 
to 
effect 
amounts 
to 
a 
demonstration. 
Of 
which 
there 
is 
this 
evident 
proof. 
The 
mind 
can 
always 
conceive 
any 
effect 
to 
follow 
from 
any 
cause, 
and 
indeed 
any 
event 
to 
follow 
upon 
another: 
whatever 
we 
conceive 
is 
possible, 
at 
least 
in 
a 
metaphysical 
sense: 
but 
wherever 
a 
demonstration 
takes 
place, 
the 
contrary 
is 
impossible, 
and 
implies 
a 
contradiction. 
There 
is 
no 
demonstration, 
therefore, 
for 
any 
conjunction 
of 
cause 
and 
effect. 
And 
this 
is 
a 
principle, 
which 
is 
generally 
allowedbyphilosophers. 


IT 
would 
have 
been 
necessary, 
therefore, 
for 
Adam 
(if 
he 
was 
not 
inspired) 
to 
have 
had 
experience 
of 
the 
effect, 
which 
followed 
upon 
the 
impulseof 
these 
two 
balls. 
He 
must 
haveseen, 
inseveral 
instances, 
that 
when 
the 
one 
ball 
struck 
upon 
the 
other, 
the 
second 
always 
acquired 
motion. 
If 
he 
had 
seen 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
instances 
of 
this 
kind, 
whenever 
he 
saw 
the 
one 
ball 
moving 
towards 
the 
other, 
he 
would 
always 
conclude 
without 
hesitation, 
that 
the 
second 
would 
acquire 
motion. 
His 
understanding 
would 
anticipatehissight,andformaconclusion 
suitabletohispastexperience. 



IT 
follows, 
then, 
that 
all 
reasonings 
concerning 
cause 
and 
effect, 
are 
founded 
on 
experience, 
and 
that 
all 
reasonings 
from 
experience 
are 
founded 
on 
the 
supposition, 
that 
the 
course 
of 
nature 
will 
continue 
uniformly 
the 
same. 
We 
conclude, 
that 
like 
causes, 
in 
like 
circumstances, 
will 
always 
produce 
like 
effects. 
It 
may 
now 
be 
worth 
while 
to 
consider, 
what 
determines 
ustoforma 
conclusionof 
suchinfiniteconsequence. 


‘TIS 
evident, 
that 
Adam 
with 
all 
his 
science, 
would 
never 
have 
been 
able 
to 
demonstrate, 
that 
the 
course 
of 
nature 
must 
continue 
uniformly 
the 
same, 
and 
that 
the 
future 
must 
be 
conformable 
to 
the 
past. 
What 
is 
possible 
can 
never 
be 
demonstrated 
to 
be 
false; 
and 
’tis 
possible 
the 
course 
of 
nature 
may 
change, 
since 
we 
can 
conceive 
such 
a 
change. 
Nay, 
I 
will 
go 
farther, 
and 
assert, 
that 
he 
could 
not 
so 
much 
as 
prove 
by 
any 
probable 
arguments, 
that 
the 
future 
must 
be 
conformable 
to 
the 
past. 
All 
probable 
arguments 
are 
built 
on 
the 
supposition, 
that 
there 
is 
this 
conformity 
betwixt 
the 
future 
and 
the 
past, 
and 
therefore 
can 
never 
prove 
it. 
This 
conformity 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
and 
if 
it 
must 
be 
proved, 
will 
admit 
of 
no 
proof 
but 
from 
experience. 
But 
our 
experience 
in 
the 
past 
can 
be 
a 
proof 
of 
nothing 
for 
the 
future, 
but 
upon 
a 
supposition, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
resemblance 
betwixt 
them. 
This 
therefore 
is 
a 
point, 
which 
can 
admit 
of 
no 
proof 
at 
all, 
and 
which 
we 
take 
for 
granted 
withoutany 
proof. 


WE 
are 
determined 
by 
CUSTOM 
alone 
to 
suppose 
the 
future 
conformable 
to 
the 
past. 
When 
I 
see 
a 
billiard-ball 
moving 
towards 
another, 
my 
mind 
is 
immediately 
carry’d 
by 
habit 
to 
the 
usual 
effect, 
and 
anticipates 
my 
sight 
by 
conceiving 
the 
second 
ball 
in 
motion. 
There 
is 
nothing 
in 
these 
objects, 
abstractlyconsidered, 
and 
independent 
of 
experience, 
which 
leads 
meto 
form 
any 
such 
conclusion: 
and 
even 
after 
I 
have 
had 
experience 
of 
many 
repeated 
effects 
of 
this 
kind, 
there 
is 
no 
argument, 
which 
determines 
me 
to 
suppose, 
that 
the 
effect 
will 
be 
conformable 
to 
past 
experience. 
The 
powers, 
by 
which 



bodies 
operate, 
are 
entirely 
unknown. 
We 
perceive 
only 
their 
sensible 
qualities: 
and 
what 
reason 
have 
we 
to 
think, 
that 
the 
same 
powers 
will 
always 
beconjoinedwith 
thesamesensiblequalities? 


‘TIS 
not, 
therefore, 
reason, 
which 
is 
the 
guide 
of 
life, 
but 
custom. 
That 
alonedeterminesthemind,inallinstances,tosupposethefutureconformable

However 
easy 
this 
step 
may 
seem, 
reason 
would 
never, 
to 
all 
eternity,beable 
tomakeit. 


THIS 
is 
a 
very 
curious 
discovery, 
but 
leads 
us 
to 
others, 
that 
are 
still 
more 
curious. 
When 
I 
see 
a 
billiard 
ball 
moving 
towards 
another, 
my 
mind 
is 
immediately 
carried 
by 
habit 
to 
the 
usualand 
anticipate 
my 
sight 
by 
conceiving 
the 
second 
ball 
in 
motion. 
But 
is 
this 
all? 
Do 
I 
nothing 
but 
CONCEIVEthe 
motionofthesecondball?Nosurely. 
Ialso 
BELIEVEthat 
it 
will 
move. 
What 
then 
is 
this 
belief? 
And 
how 
does 
it 
differ 
from 
the 
simple 
conception 
of 
any 
thing? 
Here 
is 
a 
new 
question 
unthought 
of 
by 
philosophers. 


When 
a 
demonstration 
convinces 
me 
of 
any 
proposition, 
it 
not 
only 
makes 
me 
conceive 
the 
proposition, 
but 
also 
makes 
me 
sensible, 
that 
’tis 
impossible 
to 
conceive 
any 
thing 
contrary. 
What 
is 
demonstratively 
false 
implies 
a 
contradiction; 
and 
what 
implies 
a 
contradiction 
cannot 
be 
conceived. 
But 
with 
regard 
to 
any 
matter 
of 
fact, 
however 
strong 
the 
proof 
may 
be 
from 
experience, 
I 
can 
always 
conceive 
the 
contrary, 
tho’ 
I 
cannot 
always 
believe 
it. 
The 
belief, 
therefore, 
makes 
some 
difference 
betwixt 
the 
conception 
to 
which 
we 
assent,andthattowhichwe 
donotassent. 


To 
account 
for 
this, 
there 
are 
only 
two 
hypotheses. 
It 
may 
be 
said, 
that 
belief 
joins 
some 
new 
idea 
to 
those 
which 
we 
may 
conceive 
without 
assenting 
to 
them. 
But 
this 
hypothesis 
is 
false. 
For 
first, 
no 
such 
idea 
can 
be 
produced. 
When 
we 
simply 
conceive 
an 
object, 
we 
conceive 
it 
in 
all 
its 
parts. 
We 
conceive 
it 
as 
it 
might 
exist, 
tho’ 
we 
do 
not 
believe 
it 
to 
exist. 
Our 
belief 



of 
it 
would 
discover 
no 
new 
qualities. 
We 
may 
paint 
out 
the 
entire 
object 
in 
imagination 
without 
believing 
it. 
We 
may 
set 
it, 
in 
a 
manner, 
before 
our 
eyes, 
with 
every 
circumstance 
of 
time 
and 
place. 
’Tis 
the 
very 
object 
conceived 
as 
it 
mightexist;andwhenwebelieveit, 
we 
cando 
nomore. 


Secondly, 
THE 
mind 
has 
a 
faculty 
of 
joining 
all 
ideas 
together, 
which 
involve 
not 
a 
contradiction; 
and 
therefore 
if 
belief 
consisted 
in 
some 
idea, 
which 
we 
add 
to 
the 
simple 
conception, 
it 
would 
be 
in 
a 
man’s 
power, 
by 
addingthisideatoit, 
tobelieveanything,whichhecan 
conceive. 


SINCE 
therefore 
belief 
implies 
a 
conception, 
and 
yet 
is 
something 
more; 
and 
since 
it 
adds 
no 
new 
idea 
to 
the 
conception; 
it 
follows, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
different 
MANNER 
of 
conceiving 
an 
object; 
something 
that 
is 
distinguishable 
to 
the 
feeling, 
and 
depends 
not 
upon 
our 
will, 
as 
all 
our 
ideas 
do. 
Mymindrunsbyhabitfromthevisible 
objectofoneballmovingtowards 
another, 
to 
the 
usual 
effect 
of 
motion 
in 
the 
second 
ball. 
It 
not 
only 
conceives 
that 
motion, 
but 
feels 
something 
different 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
it 
from 
a 
mere 
reverie 
of 
the 
imagination. 
The 
presence 
of 
this 
visible 
object, 
and 
the 
constant 
conjunction 
of 
that 
particular 
effect, 
render 
the 
idea 
different 
to 
the 
feeling 
from 
those 
loose 
ideas, 
which 
come 
into 
the 
mind 
without 
any 
introduction. 
This 
conclusion 
seems 
a 
little 
surprizing; 
but 
we 
are 
led 
into 
it 
by 
a 
chain 
of 
propositions, 
which 
admit 
of 
no 
doubt. 
To 
ease 
the 
reader’s 
memory 
I 
shall 
briefly 
resume 
them. 
No 
matter 
of 
fact 
can 
be 
proved 
but 
from 
its 
cause 
or 
its 
effect. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
known 
to 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
another 
but 
by 
experience. 
We 
can 
give 
no 
reason 
for 
extending 
to 
the 
future 
our 
experience 
in 
the 
past; 
but 
are 
entirely 
determined 
by 
custom, 
when 
we 
conceive 
an 
effect 
to 
follow 
from 
its 
usual 
cause. 
But 
we 
also 
believe 
an 
effect 
to 
follow, 
as 
well 
as 
conceive 
it. 
This 
belief 
joins 
no 
new 
idea 
to 
the 
conception. 
It 
only 
varies 
the 
manner 
of 
conceiving, 
and 
makes 
a 
difference 



to 
the 
feeling 
or 
sentiment. 
Belief, 
therefore, 
in 
all 
matters 
of 
fact 
arises 
only 
fromcustom, 
andisanideaconceivedin 
apeculiarmanner. 


OUR 
author 
proceeds 
to 
explain 
the 
manner 
or 
feeling, 
which 
renders 
belief 
different 
from 
a 
loose 
conception. 
He 
seems 
sensible, 
that 
’tis 
impossible 
by 
words 
to 
describe 
this 
feeling, 
which 
every 
one 
must 
be 
conscious 
of 
in 
his 
own 
breast. 
He 
calls 
it 
sometimes 
a 
stronger 
conception, 
sometimes 
a 
more 
lively, 
a 
more 
vivid, 
a 
firmer, 
or 
a 
more 
intense 
conception. 
And 
indeed, 
whatever 
name 
we 
may 
give 
to 
this 
feeling, 
which 
constitutes 
belief, 
our 
author 
thinks 
it 
evident, 
that 
it 
has 
a 
more 
forcible 
effect 
on 
the 
mind 
than 
fiction 
and 
mere 
conception. 
This 
he 
proves 
by 
its 
influence 
on 
the 
passions 
and 
on 
the 
imagination; 
which 
are 
only 
moved 
by 
truth 
or 
what 
is 
taken 
for 
such. 
Poetry, 
with 
all 
its 
art, 
can 
never 
cause 
a 
passion, 
like 
one 
in 
real 
life. 
It 
fails 
in 
the 
original 
conception 
of 
its 
objects, 
which 
never 
feel 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
those 
which 
command 
our 
belief 
and 
opinion. 


OUR 
author 
presuming, 
that 
he 
had 
sufficiently 
proved, 
that 
the 
ideas 
we 
assent 
to 
are 
different 
to 
the 
feeling 
from 
the 
other 
ideas, 
and 
that 
this 
feeling 
is 
more 
firm 
and 
lively 
than 
our 
common 
conception, 
endeavours 
in 
the 
next 
place 
to 
explain 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
lively 
feeling 
by 
an 
analogy 
with 
other 
acts 
of 
the 
mind. 
His 
reasoning 
seems 
to 
be 
curious; 
but 
could 
scarce 
be 
rendered 
intelligible, 
or 
at 
least 
probable 
to 
the 
reader, 
without 
a 
long 
detail, 
which 
would 
exceedthe 
compassIhaveprescribedtomyself. 


I 
have 
likewise 
omitted 
many 
arguments, 
which 
he 
adduces 
to 
prove 
that 
belief 
consists 
merely 
in 
a 
peculiar 
feeling 
or 
sentiment. 
I 
shall 
only 
mention 
one; 
our 
past 
experience 
is 
not 
always 
uniform. 
Sometimes 
one 
effect 
follows 
from 
a 
cause, 
sometimes 
another: 
In 
which 
case 
we 
always 
believe, 
that 
that 
will 
exist 
which 
is 
most 
common. 
I 
see 
a 
billiard-ball 
moving 
towards 
another. 
I 
cannot 
distinguish 
whether 
it 
moves 
upon 
its 
axis, 
or 
was 
struck 
so 



as 
to 
skim 
along 
the 
table. 
In 
the 
first 
case, 
I 
know 
it 
will 
not 
stop 
after 
the 
shock. 
In 
the 
second 
it 
may 
stop. 
The 
first 
is 
most 
common, 
and 
therefore 
I 
lay 
my 
account 
with 
that 
effect. 
But 
I 
also 
conceive 
the 
other 
effect, 
and 
conceive 
it 
as 
possible, 
and 
as 
connected 
with 
the 
cause. 
Were 
not 
the 
one 
conception 
different 
in 
the 
feeling 
or 
sentiment 
from 
the 
other, 
there 
would 
benodifferencebetwixtthem. 


WE 
have 
confin’d 
ourselves 
in 
this 
whole 
reasoning 
to 
the 
relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect, 
as 
discovered 
in 
the 
motions 
and 
operations 
of 
matter. 
But 
the 
same 
reasoning 
extends 
to 
the 
operations 
of 
the 
mind. 
Whether 
we 
consider 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
will 
in 
moving 
our 
body, 
or 
in 
governing 
our 
thought, 
it 
may 
safely 
be 
affirmed, 
that 
we 
could 
never 
foretel 
the 
effect, 
merely 
from 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
cause, 
without 
experience. 
And 
even 
afterwehaveexperience 
oftheseeffects, 
’tiscustomalone,notreason,which 
determines 
us 
to 
make 
it 
the 
standard 
of 
our 
future 
judgments. 
When 
the 
cause 
is 
presented, 
the 
mind, 
from 
habit, 
immediately 
passes 
to 
the 
conception 
and 
belief 
of 
the 
usual 
effect. 
This 
belief 
is 
something 
different 
from 
the 
conception. 
It 
does 
not, 
however, 
join 
any 
new 
idea 
to 
it. 
It 
only 
makesitbefeltdifferently, 
andrendersitstrongerandmorelively. 


HAVING 
dispatcht 
this 
material 
point 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
inference 
from 
cause 
and 
effect, 
our 
author 
returns 
upon 
his 
footsteps, 
and 
examines 
anew 
the 
idea 
of 
that 
relation. 
In 
the 
considering 
of 
motion 
communicatedfromone 
ballto 
another,wecould 
findnothingbutcontiguity, 
priority 
in 
the 
cause, 
and 
constant 
conjunction. 
But, 
beside 
these 
circumstances, 
’tis 
commonly 
suppos’d, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
necessary 
connexion 
betwixt 
the 
cause 
and 
effect, 
and 
that 
the 
cause 
possesses 
something, 
which 
we 
call 
a 
power, 
or 
force, 
or 
energy. 
The 
question 
is, 
what 
idea 
is 
annex’d 
to 
these 
terms? 
If 
all 
our 
ideas 
or 
thoughts 
be 
derived 
from 
our 
impressions, 
this 
power 
must 
either 
discover 
itself 
to 
our 
senses, 
or 
to 
our 
internal 
feeling. 
But 



so 
little 
does 
any 
power 
discover 
itself 
to 
the 
senses 
in 
the 
operations 
of 
matter, 
that 
the 
Cartesians 
have 
made 
no 
scruple 
to 
assert, 
that 
matter 
is 
utterly 
deprived 
of 
energy, 
and 
that 
all 
its 
operations 
are 
perform’d 
merely 
by 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
supreme 
Being. 
But 
the 
question 
still 
recurs, 
What 
idea 
have 
we 
of 
energy 
or 
power 
even 
in 
the 
supreme 
Being? 
All 
our 
idea 
of 
a 
Deity 
(according 
to 
those 
who 
deny 
innate 
ideas) 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
composition 
of 
those 
ideas, 
which 
we 
acquire 
from 
reflecting 
on 
the 
operations 
of 
our 
own 
minds. 
Now 
our 
own 
minds 
afford 
us 
no 
more 
notion 
of 
energy 
than 
matter 
does. 
When 
we 
consider 
our 
will 
or 
volition 
a 
priori, 
abstracting 
from 
experience, 
we 
should 
never 
be 
able 
to 
infer 
any 
effect 
from 
it. 
And 
when 
we 
take 
the 
assistance 
of 
experience, 
it 
only 
shows 
us 
objects 
contiguous, 
successive, 
and 
constantly 
conjoined. 
Upon 
the 
whole, 
then, 
either 
we 
have 
no 
idea 
at 
all 
of 
force 
and 
energy, 
and 
these 
words 
are 
altogether 
insignificant, 
or 
they 
can 
mean 
nothing 
but 
that 
determination 
of 
the 
thought, 
acquir’d 
by 
habit, 
to 
pass 
from 
the 
cause 
to 
its 
usual 
effect. 
But 
who-ever 
would 
thoroughly 
understand 
this 
must 
consult 
the 
author 
himself. 
’Tis 
sufficient, 
if 
I 
can 
make 
the 
learned 
world 
apprehend, 
that 
there 
is 
some 
difficulty 
in 
the 
case, 
and 
that 
who-ever 
solves 
the 
difficulty 
must 
say 
some 
thingverynewand 
extraordinary; 
asnewas 
the 
difficulty 
itself. 


BY 
all 
that 
has 
been 
said 
the 
reader 
will 
easily 
perceive, 
that 
the 
philosophy 
contain’d 
in 
this 
book 
is 
very 
sceptical, 
and 
tends 
to 
give 
us 
a 
notion 
of 
the 
imperfections 
and 
narrow 
limits 
of 
human 
understanding. 
Almost 
all 
reasoning 
is 
there 
reduced 
to 
experience; 
and 
the 
belief, 
which 
attends 
experience, 
is 
explained 
to 
be 
nothing 
but 
a 
peculiar 
sentiment, 
or 
lively 
conception 
produced 
by 
habit. 
Nor 
is 
this 
all, 
when 
we 
believe 
any 
thing 
of 
external 
existence, 
or 
suppose 
an 
object 
to 
exist 
a 
moment 
after 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
perceived, 
this 
belief 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
sentiment 
of 
the 
same 
kind. 
Our 
author 
insists 
upon 
several 
other 
sceptical 
topics; 
and 
upon 
the 
whole 



concludes, 
that 
we 
assent 
to 
our 
faculties, 
and 
employ 
our 
reason 
only 
because 
we 
cannot 
help 
it. 
Philosophy 
wou’d 
render 
us 
entirely 
Pyrrhonian, 
werenotnaturetoostrongforit. 


I 
shall 
conclude 
the 
logics 
of 
this 
author 
with 
an 
account 
of 
two 
opinions, 
which 
seem 
to 
be 
peculiar 
to 
himself, 
as 
indeed 
are 
most 
of 
his 
opinions. 
He 
asserts, 
that 
the 
soul, 
as 
far 
as 
we 
can 
conceive 
it, 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
system 
or 
train 
of 
different 
perceptions, 
those 
of 
heat 
and 
cold, 
love 
and 
anger, 
thoughts 
and 
sensations; 
all 
united 
together, 
but 
without 
any 
perfect 
simplicity 
or 
identity. 
Des 
Cartes 
maintained 
that 
thought 
was 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
mind; 
not 
this 
thought 
or 
that 
thought, 
but 
thought 
in 
general. 
This 
seems 
to 
be 
absolutely 
unintelligible, 
since 
every 
thing, 
that 
exists, 
is 
particular: 
And 
therefore 
it 
must 
be 
our 
several 
particular 
perceptions, 
that 
compose 
the 
mind. 
I 
say, 
compose 
the 
mind, 
not 
belong 
to 
it. 
The 
mind 
is 
not 
a 
substance, 
in 
which 
the 
perceptions 
inhere. 
That 
notion 
is 
as 
unintelligible 
as 
the 
Cartesian, 
that 
thought 
or 
perception 
in 
general 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
mind. 
We 
have 
no 
idea 
of 
substance 
of 
any 
kind, 
since 
we 
have 
no 
idea 
but 
what 
is 
derived 
from 
some 
impression, 
and 
we 
have 
no 
impression 
of 
any 
substance 
either 
material 
or 
spiritual. 
We 
know 
nothing 
but 
particular 
qualities 
and 
perceptions. 
As 
our 
idea 
of 
any 
body, 
a 
peach, 
for 
instance, 
is 
only 
that 
of 
a 
particular 
taste, 
colour, 
figure, 
size, 
consistence, 
&c. 
So 
our 
idea 
of 
any 
mind 
is 
only 
that 
of 
particular 
perceptions, 
without 
the 
notion 
of 
any 
thing 
we 
call 
substance,eithersimpleor 
compound. 


THEsecondprinciple,which 
Iproposedtotake 
noticeof, 
iswith 
regardto 
Geometry. 
Having 
denied 
the 
infinite 
divisibility 
of 
extension, 
our 
author 
finds 
himself 
obliged 
to 
refute 
those 
mathematical 
arguments, 
which 
have 
been 
adduced 
for 
it; 
and 
theseindeed 
aretheonlyones 
of 
any 
weight. 
This 
he 
does 
by 
denying 
Geometry 
to 
be 
a 
science 
exact 
enough 
to 
admit 
of 
conclusions 
so 
subtile 
as 
those 
which 
regard 
infinite 
divisibility. 
His 



arguments 
may 
be 
thus 
explained. 
All 
Geometry 
is 
founded 
on 
the 
notions 
of 
equality 
and 
inequality, 
and 
therefore 
according 
as 
we 
have 
or 
have 
not 
an 
exactstandardof 
that 
relation, 
the 
scienceitself 
will 
orwillnot 
admit 
of 
great 
exactness. 
Now 
there 
is 
an 
exact 
standard 
of 
equality, 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
quantity 
is 
composed 
of 
indivisible 
points. 
Two 
lines 
are 
equal 
when 
the 
numbers 
of 
the 
points, 
that 
compose 
them, 
are 
equal, 
and 
when 
there 
is 
a 
point 
in 
one 
corresponding 
to 
a 
point 
in 
the 
other. 
But 
tho’ 
this 
standard 
be 
exact, 
’tis 
useless; 
since 
we 
can 
never 
compute 
the 
number 
of 
points 
in 
any 
line. 
It 
is 
besides 
founded 
on 
the 
supposition 
of 
finite 
divisibility, 
and 
therefore 
can 
never 
afford 
any 
conclusion 
against 
it. 
If 
we 
reject 
this 
standard 
of 
equality, 
we 
have 
none 
that 
has 
any 
pretensions 
to 
exactness. 
I 
find 
two 
that 
arecommonlymadeuseof. 
Two 
linesabove 
ayard,forinstance, 
aresaid 
to 
be 
equal, 
when 
they 
contain 
any 
inferior 
quantity, 
as 
an 
inch, 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
times. 
But 
this 
runs 
in 
a 
circle. 
For 
the 
quantity 
we 
call 
an 
inch 
in 
the 
one 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
equal 
to 
what 
we 
call 
an 
inch 
in 
the 
other: 
And 
the 
question 
still 
is, 
by 
what 
standard 
we 
proceed 
when 
we 
judge 
them 
to 
be 
equal; 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
what 
we 
mean 
when 
we 
say 
they 
are 
equal. 
If 
we 
take 
still 
inferior 
quantities, 
we 
go 
on 
in 
infinitum. 
This 
therefore 
is 
no 
standard 
of 
equality. 
The 
greatest 
part 
of 
philosophers, 
when 
ask’d 
what 
they 
mean 
by 
equality, 
say, 
that 
the 
word 
admits 
of 
no 
definition, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
place 
before 
us 
two 
equal 
bodies, 
such 
as 
two 
diameters 
of 
a 
circle, 
to 
make 
us 
understand 
that 
term. 
Now 
this 
is 
taking 
the 
general 
appearance 
of 
the 
objects 
for 
the 
standard 
of 
that 
proportion, 
and 
renders 
our 
imagination 
and 
senses 
the 
ultimate 
judges 
of 
it. 
But 
such 
a 
standard 
admits 
of 
no 
exactness, 
and 
can 
never 
afford 
any 
conclusion 
contrary 
to 
the 
imagination 
and 
senses. 
Whether 
this 
question 
be 
just 
or 
not, 
must 
be 
left 
to 
the 
learned 
world 
to 
judge. 
‘Twere 
certainly 
to 
be 
wish’d, 
that 
some 
expedient 
were 
fallen 
upon 
to 
reconcile 
philosophy 
and 
common 
sense, 



which 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
question 
of 
infinite 
divisibility 
have 
wag’d 
most 
cruelwarswitheach 
other. 


WE 
must 
now 
proceed 
to 
give 
some 
account 
of 
the 
second 
volume 
of 
this 
work, 
which 
treats 
of 
the 
PASSIONS. 
’Tis 
of 
more 
easy 
comprehension 
than 
the 
first; 
but 
contains 
opinions, 
that 
are 
altogether 
as 
new 
and 
extraordinary. 
The 
author 
begins 
with 
Pride 
and 
humility. 
He 
observes, 
that 
the 
objects 
which 
excite 
these 
passions, 
are 
very 
numerous, 
and 
seemingly 
very 
different 
from 
each 
other. 
Pride 
or 
self-esteem 
may 
arise 
from 
the 
qualities 
of 
the 
mind; 
wit, 
good-sense, 
learning, 
courage, 
integrity: 
from 
those 
of 
the 
body; 
beauty, 
strength, 
agility, 
good 
mein, 
address 
in 
dancing, 
riding, 
fencing: 
from 
external 
advantages; 
country, 
family, 
children, 
relations, 
riches, 
houses, 
gardens, 
horses, 
dogs, 
cloaths. 
He 
afterwards 
proceeds 
to 
find 
out 
that 
common 
circumstance, 
in 
which 
all 
these 
objects 
agree, 
and 
which 
causes 
them 
to 
operate 
on 
the 
passions. 
His 
theory 
likewise 
extends 
to 
love 
and 
hatred, 
and 
other 
affections. 
As 
these 
questions, 
tho’ 
curious, 
could 
not 
be 
renderedintelligiblewithoutalongdiscourse,weshallhereomitthem. 


IT 
may 
perhaps 
be 
more 
acceptable 
to 
the 
reader 
to 
be 
informed 
of 
what 
our 
author 
says 
concerning 
free-will. 
He 
has 
laid 
the 
foundation 
of 
his 
doctrine 
inwhathesaidconcerningcauseandeffect, 
asabove 
explained. 


“ 
’Tis 
universally 
acknowledged, 
that 
the 
operations 
of 
external 
bodies 
are 
necessary, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
communication 
of 
their 
motion, 
in 
their 
attraction 
and 
mutualcohesion, 
there 
arenottheleasttracesofindifferenceorliberty.” 


— 


“Whatever 
therefore 
is 
in 
this 
respect 
on 
the 
same 
footing 
with 
matter, 
must 
be 
acknowledged 
to 
be 
necessary. 
That 
we 
may 
know 
whether 
this 
be 
the 
case 
with 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
mind, 
we 
may 
examine 
matter, 
and 
consider 
on 
what 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
necessity 
in 
its 
operations 
are 
founded, 
and 
why 
we 
concludeonebodyor 
actionto 
bethe 
infalliblecause 
ofanother.” 



“It 
has 
been 
observed 
already, 
that 
in 
no 
single 
instance 
the 
ultimate 
connexion 
of 
any 
object 
is 
discoverable 
either 
by 
our 
senses 
or 
reason, 
and 
that 
we 
can 
never 
penetrate 
so 
far 
into 
the 
essence 
and 
construction 
of 
bodies, 
as 
to 
perceive 
the 
principle 
on 
which 
their 
mutual 
influence 
is 
founded. 
’Tis 
their 
constant 
union 
alone, 
with 
which 
we 
are 
acquainted; 
and 
’tis 
from 
the 
constant 
union 
the 
necessity 
arises, 
when 
the 
mind 
is 
determined 
to 
pass 
from 
one 
object 
to 
its 
usual 
attendant, 
and 
infer 
the 
existence 
of 
one 
from 
that 
of 
the 
other. 
Here 
then 
are 
two 
particulars, 
which 
we 
are 
to 
regard 
as 
essential 
to 
necessity, 
viz. 
the 
constantunion 
and 
theinference 
of 
the 
mind, 
and 
wherever 
wediscover 
these 
wemustacknowledgeanecessity.” 


Now 
nothing 
is 
more 
evident 
than 
the 
constant 
union 
of 
particular 
actions 
with 
particular 
motives. 
If 
all 
actions 
be 
not 
constantly 
united 
with 
their 
proper 
motives, 
this 
uncertainty 
is 
no 
more 
than 
what 
may 
be 
observed 
every 
day 
in 
the 
actions 
of 
matter, 
where 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
mixture 
and 
uncertainty 
of 
causes, 
the 
effect 
is 
often 
variable 
and 
uncertain. 
Thirty 
grains 
of 
opium 
will 
kill 
any 
man 
that 
is 
not 
accustomed 
to 
it; 
tho’ 
thirty 
grains 
of 
rhubarb 
will 
not 
always 
purge 
him. 
In 
like 
manner 
the 
fear 
of 
death 
will 
always 
make 
a 
man 
go 
twenty 
paces 
out 
of 
his 
road; 
tho’ 
it 
will 
not 
always 
make 
him 
do 
a 
bad 
action. 


ANDasthereisoftena 
constantconjunctionof 
the 
actionsofthewillwith 
their 
motives, 
so 
the 
inference 
from 
the 
one 
to 
the 
other 
is 
often 
as 
certain 
as 
any 
reasoning 
concerning 
bodies: 
and 
there 
is 
always 
an 
inference 
proportioned 
to 
the 
constancy 
of 
the 
conjunction. 
On 
this 
is 
founded 
our 
belief 
in 
witnesses, 
our 
credit 
in 
history, 
and 
indeed 
all 
kinds 
of 
moral 
evidence, 
andalmost 
the 
wholeconductoflife. 


OUR 
author 
pretends, 
that 
this 
reasoning 
puts 
the 
whole 
controversy 
in 
a 
new 
light, 
by 
giving 
a 
new 
definition 
of 
necessity. 
And, 
indeed, 
the 
most 
zealous 
advocates 
for 
freewill 
must 
allow 
this 
union 
and 
inference 
with 



regard 
to 
human 
actions. 
They 
will 
only 
deny, 
that 
this 
makes 
the 
whole 
of 
necessity. 
But 
then 
they 
must 
shew, 
that 
we 
have 
an 
idea 
of 
something 
else 
in 
the 
actions 
of 
matter; 
which, 
according 
to 
the 
foregoing 
reasoning, 
is 
impossible. 


THRO’ 
this 
whole 
book, 
there 
are 
great 
pretensions 
to 
new 
discoveries 
in 
philosophy; 
but 
if 
any 
thing 
can 
intitle 
the 
author 
to 
so 
glorious 
a 
name 
as 
that 
of 
an 
inventor, 
’tis 
the 
use 
he 
makes 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
association 
of 
ideas, 
which 
enters 
into 
most 
of 
his 
philosophy. 
Our 
imagination 
has 
a 
great 
authority 
over 
our 
ideas; 
and 
there 
are 
no 
ideas 
that 
are 
different 
from 
each 
other, 
which 
it 
cannot 
separate, 
and 
join, 
and 
compose 
into 
all 
the 
varieties 
of 
fiction. 
But 
notwithstanding 
the 
empire 
of 
the 
imagination, 
there 
is 
a 
secret 
tie 
or 
union 
among 
particular 
ideas, 
which 
causes 
the 
mind 
to 
conjoin 
them 
more 
frequently 
together, 
and 
makes 
the 
one, 
upon 
its 
appearance, 
introduce 
the 
other. 
Hence 
arises 
what 
we 
call 
the 
apropos 
of 
discourse: 
hence 
the 
connection 
of 
writing: 
and 
hence 
that 
thread, 
or 
chain 
of 
thought, 
which 
a 
man 
naturally 
supports 
even 
in 
the 
loosest 
reverie. 
These 
principles 
of 
association 
are 
reduced 
to 
three, 
viz. 
Resemblance; 
a 
picture 
naturally 
makes 
us 
think 
of 
the 
man 
it 
was 
drawn 
for. 
Contiguity; 
when 
St. 
Dennis 
is 
mentioned, 
the 
idea 
of 
Paris 
naturally 
occurs. 
Causation; 
when 
we 
think 
of 
the 
son, 
we 
are 
apt 
to 
carry 
our 
attention 
to 
the 
father. 
‘Twill 
be 
easy 
to 
conceive 
of 
what 
vast 
consequence 
these 
principles 
must 
be 
in 
the 
science 
of 
human 
nature, 
if 
we 
consider, 
that 
so 
far 
as 
regards 
the 
mind, 
these 
are 
the 
only 
links 
that 
bind 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
universe 
together, 
or 
connect 
us 
with 
any 
person 
or 
object 
exterior 
to 
ourselves. 
For 
as 
it 
is 
by 
means 
of 
thought 
only 
that 
anythingoperatesuponourpassions,andasthesearetheonlytiesofour 
thoughts, 
they 
are 
really 
to 
us 
the 
cement 
of 
the 
universe, 
and 
all 
the 
operations 
ofthemindmust, 
ina 
great 
measure,depend 
onthem.

THE 
THIRD 
DEVELOPMENT 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
the 
understanding 
is 
that 
represented 
by 
Leibnitz 
and 
Wolff. 
If 
Wolff’s 
metaphysics 
is 
divested 
of

popular 
philosophy. 



1. 
LEIBNITZ. 
AS 
IN 
OTHER 
respects 
Leibnitz 
represents 
the 
extreme 
antithesis 
to 
Newton, 
so 
in 
respect 
of 
philosophy 
he 
presents 
a 
striking 
contrast 
to 
Locke 
and 
his 
empiricism, 
and 
also 
to 
Spinoza. 
He 
upholds 
thought 
as 
against 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
English 
school, 
and 
in 
lieu 
of 
sensuous 
Being 
he 
maintains 
Being 
for 
thought 
to 
be 
the 
essence 
of 
truth, 
just 
as 
Boehme 
at 
an 
earlier 
time 
upheld 
implicit 
Being. 
While 
Spinoza 
asserted 
the 
universality, 
the 
oneness 
of 
substance 
merely, 
and 
while 
with 
Locke 
we 
saw 
infinite 
determinations 
made 
the 
basis, 
Leibnitz, 
by 
means 
of 
his 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
individuality, 
brings 
out 
the 
essentiality 
of 
the 
opposite 
aspect 
of 
Spinoza’s 
philosophy, 
existence 
for 
self, 
the 
monad, 
but 
the 
monad 
regarded 
as 
the 
absolute 
Notion, 
though 
perhaps 
not 
yet 
as 
the 
“I.” 
The 
opposed 
principles, 
which 
were 
forced 
asunder, 
find 
their 
completion 
in 
each 
other, 
since 
Leibnitz’s 
principle 
of 
individuation 
completed 
Spinoza’s 
system 
as 
far 
as 
outward 
aspectgoes. 


Gottfried 
Wilhelm, 
Baron 
von 
Leibnitz, 
was 
born 
in 
1646 
at 
Leipzig, 
where 
his 
father 
was 
professor 
of 
Philosophy. 
The 
subject 
that 
he 
studied 
in 
view 
of 
a 
profession 
was 
jurisprudence, 
but 
first, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
fashion 
of 
the 
day, 
he 
made 
a 
study 
of 
Philosophy, 
and 
to 
it 
he 
devoted 
particular 
attention. 
To 
begin 
with, 
he 
picked 
up 
in 
Leipzig 
a 
large 
and 
miscellaneous 
stock 
of 
knowledge, 
then 
he 
studied 
Philosophy 
and 
mathematics 
at 
Jena 
under 
the 
mathematician 
and 
theosophist 
Weigel, 
and 
took 
his 
degree 
of 
Master 
of 
Philosophy 
in 
Leipzig. 
There 
also, 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
his 
graduation 
as 
Doctor 
of 
Philosophy, 
he 
defended 
certain 
philosophical 
theses, 
some 
of 
which 
discourses 
are 
still 
contained 
in 
his 
works 
(ed. 
Dutens, 
T. 
II. 
P. 
I. 
). 
His 
first 
dissertation, 
and 
that 
for 
which 
he 



obtained 
thedegree 
ofdoctor 
ofphilosophy,was: 
De 
principio 
individui,—a 
principle 
which 
remained 
the 
abstract 
principle 
of 
his 
whole 
philosophy, 
as 
opposed 
to 
that 
of 
Spinoza. 
After 
he 
had 
acquired 
a 
thorough 
knowledge 
of 
thesubject, 
he 
wished 
tograduatealsoas 
Doctor 
ofLaws. 
Butthough 
he 
died 
an 
imperial 
councillor, 
it 
was 
his 
ill 
fortune 
to 
receive 
from 
the 
Faculty 
at 
Leipzig 
a 
refusal 
to 
confer 
the 
doctorate 
upon 
him, 
his 
youth 
being 
the 
alleged 
reason. 
Such 
a 
thing 
could 
scarcely 
happen 
now-a-days. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
it 
was 
done 
because 
of 
his 
over-great 
philosophical 
attainments, 
seeing 
that 
lawyers 
are 
wont 
to 
hold 
the 
same 
in 
horror. 
He 
now 
quitted 
Leipzig, 
and 
betook 
himself 
to 
Altdorf, 
where 
he 
graduated 
with 
distinction. 
Shortly 
afterwards 
he 
became 
acquainted 
in 
Nürnberg 
with 
a 
company 
of 
alchemists, 
with 
whose 
ongoings 
he 
became 
associated. 
Here 
he 
made 
extracts 
from 
alchemistic 
writings, 
and 
studied 
the 
mysteries 
of 
this 
occult 
science. 
His 
activity 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
learning 
extended 
also 
to 
historical, 
diplomatic, 
mathematical 
and 
philosophical 
subjects. 
He 
subsequently 
entered 
the 
service 
of 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mayence, 
becoming 
a 
member 
of 
council, 
and 
in 
1672 
he 
was 
appointed 
tutor 
to 
a 
son 
of 
Von 
Boineburg, 
Chancellor 
of 
State 
to 
the 
Elector. 
With 
this 
young 
man 
he 
travelled 
to 
Paris, 
where 
he 
lived 
for 
four 
years. 
He 
at 
this 
time 
made 
the 
acquaintance 
of 
the 
great 
mathematician 
Huygens, 
and 
was 
by 
him 
for 
the 
first 
time 
properly 
introduced 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
mathematics. 
When 
the 
education 
of 
his 
pupil 
was 
completed, 
and 
the 
Baron 
Von 
Boineburg 
died, 
Leibnitz 
went 
on 
his 
own 
account 
to 
London, 
where 
he 
became 
acquainted 
with 
Newton 
and 
other 
scholars, 
at 
whose 
head 
was 
Oldenburg, 
who 
was 
also 
on 
friendly 
terms 
with 
Spinoza. 
After 
the 
death 
of 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mayence, 
the 
salary 
of 
Leibnitz 
ceased 
to 
be 
paid; 
he 
therefore 
left 
England 
and 
returned 
to 
France. 
The 
Duke 
of 
Brunswick-
Lüneburg 
then 
took 
him 
into 
his 
service, 
and 
gave 
him 
the 
appointment 
of 
councillor 
and 
librarian 
at 
Hanover, 
with 
permission 
to 
spend 
as 
much 
time 



as 
he 
liked 
in 
foreign 
countries. 
He 
therefore 
remained 
for 
some 
time 
longer 
in 
France, 
England, 
and 
Holland. 
In 
the 
year 
1677 
he 
settled 
down 
in 
Hanover, 
where 
he 
became 
busily 
engaged 
in 
affairs 
of 
state, 
and 
was 
specially 
occupied 
with 
historical 
matters. 
In 
the 
Harz 
Mountains 
he 
had 
works 
constructed 
for 
carrying 
off 
the 
floods 
which 
did 
damage 
to 
the 
mines 
there. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
manifold 
occupations 
he 
invented 
the 
differential 
calculus 
in 
1677, 
on 
occasion 
of 
which 
there 
arose 
a 
dispute 
between 
him 
and 
Newton, 
which 
was 
carried 
on 
by 
the 
latter 
and 
the 
Royal 
Society 
of 
London 
in 
a 
most 
ungenerous 
manner. 
For 
it 
was 
asserted 
by 
the 
English, 
who 
gave 
themselves 
the 
credit 
of 
everything, 
and 
were 
very 
unfair 
to 
others, 
that 
the 
discovery 
was 
really 
made 
by 
Newton. 
But 
Newton’s 
Principia 
only 
appeared 
later, 
and 
in 
the 
first 
edition 
indeed 
Leibnitz 
was 
mentioned 
with 
commendation 
in 
a 
note 
which 
was 
afterwards 
omitted. 
From 
his 
headquarters 
in 
Hanover, 
Leibnitz, 
commissioned 
by 
his 
prince, 
made 
several 
journeys 
through 
Germany, 
and 
also 
went 
to 
Italy 
in 
order 
to 
collect 
historical 
evidence 
relative 
to 
the 
House 
of 
Este, 
and 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
proving 
more 
clearly 
the 
relationship 
between 
this 
princely 
family 
and 
that 
of 
Brunswick-Lüneburg. 
At 
other 
times 
he 
was 
likewise 
much 
occupied 
with 
historical 
questions. 
Owing 
to 
his 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
consort 
of 
Frederick 


I. 
of 
Prussia, 
Sophia 
Charlotte, 
a 
Hanoverian 
princess, 
he 
was 
enabled 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
foundation 
of 
an 
Academy 
of 
Science 
in 
Berlin, 
in 
which 
city 
he 
lived 
for 
a 
considerable 
time. 
In 
Vienna 
he 
also 
became 
acquainted 
with 
Prince 
Eugène, 
which 
occasioned 
his 
being 
appointed 
finally 
an 
Imperial 
Councillor. 
He 
published 
several 
very 
important 
historical 
works 
as 
the 
result 
of 
this 
journey. 
His 
death 
took 
place 
at 
Hanover 
in 
1716, 
when 
he 
was 
seventyyearsofage. 
It 
was 
not 
only 
on 
Philosophy, 
but 
also 
on 
the 
most 
varied 
branches 
of 
science 
that 
Leibnitz 
expended 
toil 
and 
trouble 
and 
energy; 
it 
was 
to 



mathematics, 
however, 
that 
he 
specially 
devoted 
his 
attention, 
and 
he 
is 
the 
inventor 
of 
the 
methods 
of 
the 
integral 
and 
differential 
calculus. 
His 
great 
services 
in 
regard 
to 
mathematics 
and 
physics 
we 
here 
leave 
out 
of 
consideration, 
and 
pay 
attention 
to 
his 
philosophy 
alone. 
None 
of 
his 
books 
can 
be 
exactly 
looked 
on 
as 
giving 
a 
complete 
systematic 
account 
of 
his 
philosophy. 
To 
the 
more 
important 
among 
them 
belongs 
his 
work 
on 
the 
human 
understanding 
(Nouveaux 
essais 
sur 
l’entendement 
humain) 
in 
reply 
to 
Locke; 
but 
this 
is 
a 
mere 
refutation. 
His 
philosophy 
is 
therefore 
scattered 
through 
various 
little 
treatises 
which 
were 
written 
in 
very 
various 
connections, 
in 
letters, 
and 
replies 
to 
objections 
which 
caused 
him 
to 
bring 
out 
one 
aspect 
of 
the 
question 
more 
strongly 
than 
another; 
we 
consequently 
find 
no 
elaborated 
systematic 
whole, 
superintended 
or 
perfected 
by 
him. 
The 
work 
which 
has 
some 
appearance 
of 
being 
such, 
his 
Théodicée, 
better 
known 
to 
the 
public 
than 
anything 
else 
he 
wrote, 
is 
a 
popular 
treatise 
which 
he 
drew 
up 
for 
Queen 
Sophia 
Charlotte 
in 
reply 
to 
Bayle, 
and 
in 
which 
he 
took 
pains 
not 
to 
present 
the 
matter 
in 
very 
speculative 
form. 
A 
Wurtemberg 
theologian, 
Pfaff 
by 
name, 
and 
others 
who 
were 
correspondents 
of 
Leibnitz 
and 
were 
themselves 
only 
too 
well 
versed 
in 
philosophy, 
brought 
it 
as 
a 
charge 
against 
Leibnitz 
— 
a 
charge 
which 
he 
never 
denied 
— 
that 
his 
philosophy 
was 
written 
in 
popular 
form. 
They 
laughed 
very 
much 
afterwards 
at 
Wolff, 
who 
had 
taken 
them 
to 
be 
quite 
in 
earnest; 
his 
opinion 
was 
that 
if 
Leibnitz 
were 
not 
perfectly 
serious 
in 
this 
sense 
with 
his 
Théodicée, 
yet 
he 
had 
unconsciously 
written 
his 
best 
therein. 
Leibnitz’s 
Théodicée 
is 
not 
what 
we 
can 
altogether 
appreciate; 
it 
is 
a 
justification 
of 
God 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
evil 
in 
the 
world. 
His 
really 
philosophic 
thoughts 
are 
most 
connectedly 
expressed 
in 
a 
treatise 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
Grace 
(Principes 
de 
la 
Nature 
et 
de 
la 
Grace), 
and 
especially 
in 
the 
pamphlet 
addressed 
to 
Prince 
Eugène 
of 
Savoy. 
Buhle 
(Geschichte 
der 
neuern 
Philosophie, 
vol. 
iv. 
section 
1, 
) 
says: 
“His 



philosophy 
is 
not 
so 
much 
the 
product 
of 
free, 
independent, 
original 
speculation, 
as 
the 
result 
of 
well-tested 
earlier” 
and 
later 
“systems, 
an 
eclecticism 
whose 
defects 
he 
tried 
to 
remedy 
in 
his 
own 
way. 
It 
is 
a 
desultory 
treatmentofPhilosophyinletters.” 


Leibnitzfollowedthesamegeneral 
planinhis 
philosophyas 
thephysicists 
adopt 
when 
they 
advance 
a 
hypothesis 
to 
explain 
existing 
data. 
He 
has 
it 
that 
general 
conceptions 
of 
the 
Idea 
are 
to 
be 
found, 
from 
which 
the 
particular 
may 
be 
derived; 
here, 
on 
account 
of 
existing 
data, 
the 
general 
conception, 
for 
example 
the 
determination 
of 
force 
or 
matter 
furnished 
by 
reflection, 
must 
have 
its 
determinations 
disposed 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
fits 
in 
with 
the 
data. 
Thus 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Leibnitz 
seems 
to 
be 
not 
so 
much 
a 
philosophic 
system 
as 
an 
hypothesis 
regarding 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
world, 
namely 
how 
it 
is 
to 
be 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
metaphysical 
determinations 
and 
the 
data 
and 
assumptions 
of 
the 
ordinary 
conception, 
which 
are 
accepted 
as 
valid 
— 
thoughts 
which 
are 
moreover 
propounded 
without 
the 
sequence 
pertaining 
to 
the 
Notion 
and 
mainly 
in 
narrative 
style, 
and 
which 
taken 
by 
themselves 
show 
no 
necessity 
in 
their 
connection. 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy 
therefore 
appears 
like 
a 
string 
of 
arbitrary 
assertions, 
which 
follow 
one 
on 
another 
like 
a 
metaphysical 
romance; 
it 
is 
only 
when 
we 
see 
what 
he 
wished 
thereby 
to 
avoid 
that 
we 
learn 
to 
appreciate 
its 
value. 
He 
really 
makes 
use 
of 
external 
reasons 
mainly 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
relations: 
“Because 
the 
validity 
of 
such 
relations 
cannot 
be 
allowed, 
nothing 
remains 
but 
to 
establish 
the 
matter 
in 
this 
way.” 
If 
we 
are 
not 
acquainted 
with 
these 
reasons, 
this 
procedurestrikesus 
asarbitrary. 


a. 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy 
is 
an 
idealism 
of 
the 
intellectuality 
of 
the 
universe; 
and 
although 
from 
one 
point 
of 
view 
he 
stands 
opposed 
to 
Locke, 
as 
from 
another 
point 
of 
view 
he 
is 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
Substance 
of 
Spinoza, 
he 
yet 
binds 
them 
both 
together 
again. 
For, 
to 
go 
into 
the 
matter 
more 

particularly, 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
he 
expresses 
in 
the 
many 
monads 
the 
absolute 
nature 
of 
things 
distinguished 
and 
of 
individuality; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
contrast 
to 
this 
and 
apart 
from 
it, 
he 
expresses 
the 
ideality 
of 
Spinoza 
and 
the 
non-absolute 
nature 
of 
all 
difference, 
as 
the 
idealism 
of 
the 
popular 
conception. 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy 
is 
a 
metaphysics, 
and 
in 
sharp 
contrast 
to 
the 
simple 
universal 
Substance 
of 
Spinoza, 
where 
all 
that 
is 
determined 
is 
merely 
transitory, 
it 
makes 
fundamental 
the 
absolute 
multiplicity 
of 
individual 
substances, 
which 
after 
the 
example 
of 
the 
ancients 
he 
named 
monads 
—anexpressionalreadyusedby 
the 
Pythagoreans. 
Thesemonadshe 
thenproceedstodetermineasfollows. 


Firstly 
“Substance 
is 
a 
thing 
that 
is 
capable 
of 
activity, 
it 
is 
compound 
or 
simple, 
the 
compound 
cannot 
exist 
without 
the 
simple. 
The 
monads 
are 
simple 
substances.” 
The 
proof 
that 
they 
constitute 
the 
truth 
in 
all 
things 
is 
very 
simple, 
it 
is 
a 
superficial 
reflection. 
For 
instance, 
one 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
maxims 
is 
“Because 
there 
are 
compound 
things, 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
same 
must 
be 
simple, 
for 
the 
compound 
consists 
of 
the 
simple.” 
This 
proof 
is 
poor 
enough, 
it 
is 
an 
example 
of 
the 
favourite 
way 
of 
starting 
from 
something 
definite, 
say 
the 
compound, 
and 
then 
drawing 
conclusions 
therefrom 
as 
to 
the 
simple. 
It 
is 
quite 
light 
in 
a 
way, 
but 
really 
it 
is 
tautology. 
Of 
course, 
if 
the 
compound 
exists, 
so 
does 
the 
simple, 
for 
the 
compound 
means 
something 
in 
itself 
manifold 
whose 
connection 
or 
unity 
is 
external. 
From 
the 
very 
trivial 
category 
of 
the 
compound 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
deduce 
the 
simple. 
It 
is 
a 
conclusion 
drawn 
from 
a 
certain 
premiss, 
but 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
the 
premiss 
is 
true. 
These 
monads 
are 
not, 
however, 
something 
abstract 
and 
simple 
in 
itself, 
like 
the 
empty 
Epicurean 
atoms, 
which, 
as 
they 
were 
in 
themselves 
lacking 
in 
determination, 
drew 
all 
their 
determination 
from 
their 
aggregation 
alone. 
The 
monads 
are, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
substantial 
forms, 
a 
good 
expression, 
borrowed 
from 
the 
Scholastics 
(supra, 
), 
or 
the 
metaphysical 
points 
of 
the 
Alexandrian 



School 
(Vol 
II. 
), 
they 
are 
the 
entelechies 
of 
Aristotle 
taken 
as 
pure 
activity, 
which 
are 
forms 
in 
themselves 
(Vol 
II. 
p, 
182, 
183). 
“These 
monads 
are 
not 
material 
or 
extended, 
nor 
do 
they 
originateordecayinthe 
naturalfashion, 
for 
they 
can 
begin 
only 
by 
a 
creative 
act 
of 
God, 
and 
they 
can 
end 
only 
by 
annihilation.” 
Thereby 
they 
are 
distinguished 
from 
the 
atoms, 
which 
are 
regarded 
simply 
as 
principles. 
The 
expression 
creation 
we 
are 
familiar 
with 
from 
religion, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
meaningless 
word 
derived 
from 
the 
ordinary 
conception; 
in 
order 
to 
be 
a 
thought 
and 
to 
have 
philosophic 
significance, 
it 
mustbemuchmorecloselydefined. 


Secondly: 
“On 
account 
of 
their 
simplicity 
the 
monads 
are 
not 
susceptible 
of 
alteration 
by 
another 
monad 
in 
their 
inner 
essence; 
there 
is 
no 
causal 
connection 
between 
them.” 
Each 
of 
them 
is 
something 
indifferent 
and 
independent 
as 
regards 
the 
rest, 
otherwise 
it 
would 
not 
be 
an 
entelechy. 
Each 
of 
them 
is 
so 
much 
for 
itself 
that 
all 
its 
determinations 
and 
modifications 
go 
on 
in 
itself 
alone, 
and 
no 
determination 
from 
without 
takes 
place. 
Leibnitz 
says: 
“There 
are 
three 
ways 
in 
which 
substances 
are 
connected: 
(1) 
Causality, 
influence; 
(2) 
The 
relation 
of 
assistance; 
(3) 
The 
relation 
of 
harmony. 
The 
relation 
of 
influence 
is 
a 
relation 
pertaining 
to 
a 
commonplace 
or 
popular 
philosophy. 
But 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
understand 
how 
material 
particles 
or 
immaterial 
qualities 
can 
pass 
from 
one 
substance 
into 
another, 
such 
a 
conception 
as 
this 
must 
be 
abandoned.” 
If 
we 
accept 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
many, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
transition 
at 
all; 
each 
is 
an 
ultimate 
and 
absolutely 
independent 
entity. 
“The 
system 
of 
assistance,” 
according 
to 
Descartes, 
“is 
something 
quite 
superfluous, 
a 
Deus 
ex 
machina, 
because 
continual 
miracles 
in 
the 
things 
of 
nature 
are 
assumed.” 
If 
we, 
like 
Descartes, 
assume 
independent 
substances, 
no 
causal 
nexus 
is 
conceivable; 
for 
this 
presupposes 
an 
influence, 
a 
bearing 
of 
the 
one 
upon 
the 
other, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
the 
other 
is 
not 
a 
substance. 
“Therefore 
there 
remains 
only 
harmony, 
a 
unity 
which 
is 
in 



itself 
or 
implicit. 
The 
monad 
is 
therefore 
simply 
shut 
up 
in 
itself, 
and 
cannot 
be 
determined 
by 
another; 
this 
other 
cannot 
be 
set 
into 
it. 
It 
can 
neither 
get 
outside 
itself, 
nor 
can 
others 
get 
inside 
it.” 
That 
is 
also 
Spinoza’s 
way 
of 
regarding 
matters: 
each 
attribute 
entirely 
represents 
the 
essence 
of 
God 
for 
itself,extensionandthoughthaveno 
influence 
oneachother. 


In 
the 
third 
place, 
“however, 
these 
monads 
must 
at 
the 
same 
time 
have 
certain 
qualities 
or 
determinations 
in 
themselves, 
inner 
actions, 
through 
which 
they 
are 
distinguished 
from 
others. 
There 
cannot 
be 
two 
things 
alike, 
for 
otherwise 
they 
would 
not 
be 
two, 
they 
would 
not 
be 
different, 
but 
one 
and 
the 
same.” 
Here 
then 
Leibnitz’s 
axiom 
of 
the 
undistinguishable 
comes 
into 
words. 
What 
is 
not 
in 
itself 
distinguished 
is 
not 
distinguished. 
This 
may 
be 
taken 
in 
a 
trivial 
sense, 
as 
that 
there 
are 
not 
two 
individuals 
which 
are 
alike. 
To 
such 
sensuous 
things 
the 
maxim 
has 
no 
application, 
it 
is 
prima 
facie 
indifferent 
whether 
there 
are 
things 
which 
are 
alike 
or 
not; 
there 
may 
also 
be 
always 
a 
difference 
of 
space. 
This 
is 
the 
superficial 
sense, 
which 
does 
not 
concern 
us. 
The 
more 
intimate 
sense 
is, 
however, 
that 
each 
thing 
is 
in 
itself 
something 
determined, 
distinguishing 
itself 
from 
others 
implicitly 
or 
in 
itself. 
Whether 
two 
things 
are 
like 
or 
unlike 
is 
only 
a 
comparison 
which 
we 
make, 
which 
falls 
within 
our 
ken. 
But 
what 
we 
have 
further 
to 
consider 
is 
the 
determined 
difference 
in 
themselves. 
The 
difference 
must 
be 
a 
difference 
in 
themselves, 
not 
for 
our 
comparison, 
for 
the 
subject 
must 
have 
the 
difference 
as 
its 
own 
peculiar 
characteristic 
or 
determination, 
i.e. 
thedetermination 
must 
be 
immanent 
in 
the 
individual. 
Not 
only 
do 
we 
distinguish 
the 
animal 
by 
its 
claws, 
but 
it 
distinguishes 
itself 
essentially 
thereby, 
it 
defends 
itself, 
it 
preserves 
itself. 
If 
two 
things 
are 
different 
only 
in 
being 
two, 
then 
each 
of 
them 
is 
one; 
but 
the 
fact 
of 
their 
being 
two 
does 
not 
constitute 
a 
distinction 
between 
them;thedetermineddifferenceinitselfistheprincipalpoint. 



Fourthly: 
“The 
determinateness 
and 
the 
variation 
thereby 
established 
is, 
however, 
an 
inward 
implicit 
principle; 
it 
is 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
modifications, 
of 
relations 
to 
surrounding 
existences, 
but 
a 
multiplicity 
which 
remains 
locked 
up 
in 
simplicity. 
Determinateness 
and 
variation 
such 
as 
this, 
which 
remains 
and 
goes 
on 
in 
the 
existence 
itself, 
is 
a 
perception;” 
and 
therefore 
Leibnitz 
says 
all 
monads 
perceive 
or 
represent 
(for 
we 
may 
translate 
perceptio 
by 
representation 
[Vorstellung]). 
In 
other 
words, 
they 
are 
in 
themselves 
universal, 
for 
universality 
is 
just 
simplicity 
in 
multiplicity, 
and 
therefore 
a 
simplicity 
which 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
change 
and 
motion 
of 
multiplicity. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
important 
determination; 
in 
substance 
itself 
there 
is 
negativity, 
determinateness, 
without 
its 
simplicity 
and 
its 
implicitude 
being 
given 
up. 
Further, 
in 
it 
there 
is 
this 
idealism, 
that 
the 
simple 
is 
something 
in 
itself 
distinguished, 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
variation, 
that 
it 
yet 
remains 
one, 
and 
continues 
in 
its 
simplicity. 
An 
instance 
of 
this 
is 
found 
in 
“I,” 
my 
spirit. 
I 
have 
many 
conceptions, 
a 
wealth 
of 
thought 
is 
in 
me, 
and 
yet 
I 
remain 
one, 
notwithstanding 
this 
variety 
of 
state. 
This 
identity 
may 
be 
found 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
what 
is 
different 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
abrogated, 
and 
is 
determined 
as 
one; 
the 
monads 
are 
therefore 
distinguished 
by 
modifications 
in 
themselves, 
but 
not 
by 
external 
determinations. 
These 
determinations 
contained 
in 
the 
monads 
exist 
in 
them 
in 
ideal 
fashion; 
this 
ideality 
in 
the 
monad 
is 
in 
itself 
a 
whole, 
so 
that 
these 
differences 
are 
only 
representations 
and 
ideas. 
This 
absolute 
difference 
is 
what 
is 
termed 
the 
Notion; 
what 
falls 
asunder 
in 
the 
mere 
representation 
is 
held 
together. 
This 
is 
what 
possesses 
interest 
in 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy. 
Such 
ideality 
in 
the 
same 
way 
pertains 
to 
the 
material, 
which 
is 
also 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
monads; 
therefore 
the 
system 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
an 
intellectual 
system, 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
all 
that 
is 
material 
has 
powers 
of 
representation 
and 
perception. 
As 
thus 
representing, 
the 
monad, 
says 
Leibnitz, 
possesses 
activity; 
for 
activity 
is 
to 
be 
different, 
and 
yet 
to 
be 
one, 



and 
this 
is 
the 
only 
true 
difference. 
The 
monad 
not 
only 
represents, 
it 
also 
changes; 
but 
in 
doing 
so, 
it 
yet 
remains 
in 
itself 
absolutely 
what 
it 
is. 
This 
variation 
is 
based 
on 
activity. 
“The 
activity 
of 
the 
inner 
principle, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
passes 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another, 
is 
desire 
(appetitus).” 
Variation 
in 
representation 
is 
desire, 
and 
that 
constitutes 
the 
spontaneity 
of 
the 
monad; 
all 
is 
now 
complete 
in 
itself, 
and 
the 
category 
of 
influence 
falls 
away. 
Indeed, 
this 
intellectuality 
of 
all 
things 
is 
a 
great 
thought 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Leibnitz: 
“All 
multiplicity 
is 
included 
in 
unity;” 
determination 
is 
not 
a 
difference 
in 
respect 
of 
something 
else, 
but 
reflected 
into 
itself, 
and 
maintaining 
itself. 
This 
is 
one 
aspect 
of 
things, 
but 
the 
matter 
is 
not 
therein 
complete;itisequallythecasethatitisdifferentin 
respect 
ofotherthings. 


Fifthly: 
These 
representations 
and 
ideas 
are 
not 
necessarily 
conscious 
representations 
and 
ideas, 
any 
more 
than 
all 
monads 
as 
forming 
representations 
are 
conscious. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
consciousness 
is 
itself 
perception, 
but 
a 
higher 
grade 
of 
the 
same; 
perceptions 
of 
consciousness 
Leibnitz 
calls 
apperceptions. 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
merely 
representing 
and 
the 
self-
conscious 
monads 
Leibnitz 
makes 
one 
of 
degrees 
of 
clearness. 
The 
expression 
representation 
has, 
however, 
certainly 
something 
awkward 
about 
it, 
since 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
associate 
it 
only 
with 
consciousness, 
and 
with 
consciousness 
as 
such; 
but 
Leibnitz 
admits 
also 
of 
unconscious 
representation. 
When 
he 
then 
adduces 
examples 
of 
unconscious 
representations, 
he 
appeals 
to 
the 
condition 
of 
a 
swoon 
or 
of 
sleep, 
in 
which 
we 
are 
mere 
monads: 
and 
that 
representations 
without 
consciousness 
are 
present 
in 
such 
states 
he 
shows 
from 
the 
fact 
of 
our 
having 
perceptions 
immediately 
after 
awakening 
out 
of 
sleep, 
which 
shows 
that 
others 
must 
have 
been 
there, 
for 
one 
perception 
arises 
only 
out 
of 
others. 
That 
is 
a 
trivial 
and 
empiricaldemonstration. 



Sixthly: 
These 
monads 
constitute 
the 
principle 
of 
all 
that 
exists. 
Matter 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
their 
passive 
capability. 
This 
passive 
capability 
it 
is 
which 
constitutes 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
representations, 
or 
a 
confusion 
which 
never 
arrives 
at 
distinction, 
or 
desire, 
or 
activity. 
That 
is 
a 
correct 
definition 
of 
the 
conception; 
it 
is 
Being, 
matter, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
moment 
of 
simplicity. 
This 
is 
implicitly 
activity; 
“mere 
implicitness 
without 
actualization” 
would 
therefore 
be 
a 
better 
expression. 
The 
transition 
from 
obscurity 
to 
distinctness 
Leibnitzexemplifies 
bythe 
stateofswooning. 


Seventhly: 
Bodies 
as 
bodies 
are 
aggregates 
of 
monads: 
they 
are 
mere 
heaps 
which 
cannot 
be 
termed 
substances, 
any 
more 
than 
a 
flock 
of 
sheep 
can 
bear 
this 
name. 
The 
continuity 
of 
the 
same 
is 
an 
arrangement 
or 
extension, 
but 
space 
is 
nothing 
in 
itself; 
it 
is 
only 
in 
another, 
or 
a 
unity 
which 
our 
understandinggivesto 
thataggregate. 


b. 
Leibnitz 
goes 
on 
to 
determine 
and 
distinguish 
more 
clearly 
as 
the 
principal 
moments, 
inorganic, 
organic, 
and 
conscious 
monads, 
and 
he 
does 
it 
inthefollowingway. 
α. 
Such 
bodies 
as 
have 
no 
inner 
unity, 
whose 
elements 
are 
connected 
merely 
by 
space, 
or 
externally, 
are 
inorganic; 
they 
have 
not 
an 
entelechy 
or 
one 
monad 
which 
rules 
over 
the 
rest. 
The 
continuity 
of 
space 
as 
a 
merely 
external 
relation 
has 
not 
the 
Notion 
in 
itself 
of 
the 
likeness 
of 
these 
monads 
in 
themselves. 
Continuity 
is 
in 
fact 
to 
be 
regarded 
in 
them 
as 
an 
arrangement, 
a 
similarity 
in 
themselves. 
Leibnitz 
therefore 
defines 
their 
movements 
as 
like 
one 
another, 
as 
a 
harmony 
in 
themselves; 
but 
again, 
this 
is 
as 
much 
as 
saying 
that 
their 
similarity 
is 
not 
in 
themselves. 
In 
fact 
continuity 
forms 
the 
essential 
determination 
of 
the 
inorganic; 
but 
it 
must 
at 
the 
same 
time 
not 
be 
taken 
as 
something 
external 
or 
as 
likeness, 
but 
as 
penetrating 
or 
penetrated 
unity, 
which 
has 
dissolved 
individuality 
in 
itself 
like 
a 
fluid. 
But 
to 
this 
point 



Leibnitz 
does 
not 
attain, 
because 
for 
him 
monads 
are 
the 
absolute 
principle, 
and 
individualitydoesnotannul 
itself. 


β. 
A 
higher 
degree 
of 
Being 
is 
found 
in 
bodies 
with 
life 
and 
soul, 
in 
which 
one 
monad 
has 
dominion 
over 
the 
rest. 
The 
body 
which 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
monad, 
of 
which 
the 
one 
monad 
is 
the 
entelechy 
or 
soul, 
is 
with 
this 
soul 
named 
a 
living 
creature, 
an 
animal. 
One 
such 
entelechy 
rules 
over 
the 
rest, 
yet 
not 
really, 
but 
formally: 
the 
limbs 
of 
this 
animal, 
however, 
are 
again 
themselves 
such 
living 
things, 
each 
of 
which 
has 
in 
its 
turn 
its 
ruling 
entelechy 
within 
it. 
But 
ruling 
is 
here 
an 
inappropriate 
expression. 
To 
rule 
in 
this 
case 
is 
not 
to 
rule 
over 
others, 
for 
all 
are 
independent; 
it 
is 
therefore 
only 
a 
formal 
expression. 
If 
Leibnitz 
had 
not 
helped 
himself 
out 
with 
the 
word 
rule, 
and 
developed 
the 
idea 
further, 
this 
dominant 
monad 
would 
have 
abrogated 
the 
others, 
and 
put 
them 
in 
a 
negative 
position; 
the 
implicitness 
of 
the 
other 
monads, 
or 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
absolute 
Being 
of 
these 
points 
or 
individuals 
would 
have 
disappeared. 
Yet 
we 
shall 
later 
on 
come 
across 
this 
relationoftheindividuals 
toone 
another. 


γ. 
The 
conscious 
monad 
distinguishes 
itself 
from 
the 
naked 
(material) 
monads 
by 
the 
distinctness 
of 
the 
representation. 
But 
this 
is 
of 
course 
only 
an 
indefinite 
word, 
a 
formal 
distinction; 
it 
indicates 
that 
consciousness 
is 
the 
very 
thing 
that 
constitutes 
the 
distinction 
of 
the 
undistinguished, 
and 
that 
distinction 
constitutes 
the 
determination 
of 
consciousness. 
Leibnitz 
more 
particularly 
defined 
the 
distinction 
of 
man 
as 
that 
“he 
is 
capable 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
necessary 
and 
eternal 
truths,” 
— 
or 
that 
he 
conceives 
the 
universal 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
what 
is 
connected 
with 
it; 
the 
nature 
and 
essence 
of 
self-consciousness 
lies 
in 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
Notions. 
“These 
eternal 
truths 
rest 
on 
two 
maxims; 
the 
one 
is 
that 
of 
contradiction, 
the 
other 
is 
that 
of 
sufficient 
reason.” 
The 
former 
of 
these 
is 
unity 
expressed 
in 
useless 
fashion 
as 
a 
maxim, 
the 
distinction 
of 
the 



undistinguishable, 
A 
= 
A; 
it 
is 
the 
definition 
of 
thinking, 
but 
not 
a 
maxim 
which 
could 
contain 
a 
truth 
as 
content, 
or 
it 
does 
not 
express 
the 
Notion 
of 
distinction 
as 
such. 
The 
other 
important 
principle 
was, 
on 
the 
other 
hand: 
What 
is 
not 
distinguished 
in 
thought 
is 
not 
distinguished 
(). 
“The 
maxim 
of 
the 
reason 
is 
that 
everything 
has 
its 
reason,” 
— 
the 
particular 
has 
the 
universal 
as 
its 
essential 
reality. 
Necessary 
truth 
must 
have 
its 
reason 
in 
itself 
in 
such 
a 
manner 
that 
it 
is 
found 
by 
analysis, 
i.e. 
through 
that 
very 
maxim 
of 
identity. 
For 
analysis 
is 
the 
very 
favourite 
plan 
of 
resolving 
into 
simple 
ideas 
and 
principles: 
a 
resolution 
which 
annihilates 
their 
relation, 
and 
which 
therefore 
in 
fact 
forms 
a 
transition 
into 
the 
opposite, 
though 
it 
does 
not 
have 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
same, 
and 
on 
that 
account 
also 
excludes 
the 
Notion; 
for 
every 
opposite 
it 
lays 
hold 
of 
only 
in 
its 
identity. 
Sufficient 
reason 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
pleonasm; 
but 
Leibnitz 
understood 
by 
this 
aims, 
final 
causes 
(causæ 
finales), 
the 
difference 
between 
which 
and 
the 
causal 
nexus 
or 
the 
efficient 
causeheherebringsunderdiscussion. 


c. 
The 
universal 
itself, 
absolute 
essence, 
which 
with 
Leibnitz 
is 
something 
quite 
different 
from 
the 
monads, 
separates 
itself 
also 
into 
two 
sides, 
namely 
universalBeingand 
Beingas 
the 
unity 
ofopposites. 
α. 
That 
universal 
is 
God, 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
world, 
to 
the 
consciousness 
of 
whom 
the 
above 
principle 
of 
sufficient 
reason 
certainly 
forms 
the 
transition. 
The 
existence 
of 
God 
is 
only 
an 
inference 
from 
eternal 
truths; 
for 
these 
must 
as 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
have 
a 
universal 
sufficient 
reason 
which 
determines 
itself 
as 
none 
other 
than 
God. 
Eternal 
truth 
is 
therefore 
the 
consciousness 
of 
the 
universal 
and 
absolute 
in 
and 
for 
itself; 
and 
this 
universal 
and 
absolute 
is 
God, 
who, 
as 
one 
with 
Himself, 
the 
monad 
of 
monads, 
is 
the 
absolute 
Monas. 
Here 
we 
again 
have 
the 
wearisome 
proof 
of 
His 
existence: 
He 
is 
the 
fountain 
of 
eternal 
truths 
and 
Notions, 
and 
without 
Him 
no 
potentiality 
would 
have 
actuality; 
He 
has 
the 
prerogative 
of 
existing 
immediately 
in 
His 
potentiality. 



God 
is 
here 
also 
the 
unity 
of 
potentiality 
and 
actuality, 
but 
in 
an 
uncomprehending 
manner; 
what 
is 
necessary, 
but 
not 
comprehended, 
is 
transferred 
to 
Him. 
Thus 
God 
is 
at 
first 
comprehended 
chiefly 
as 
universal, 
butalreadyintheaspect 
oftherelation 
ofopposites. 


β. 
As 
regards 
this 
second 
aspect, 
the 
absolute 
relation 
of 
opposites, 
it 
occurs 
in 
the 
first 
place 
in 
the 
form 
of 
absolute 
opposites 
of 
thought, 
the 
good 
and 
the 
evil. 
“God 
is 
the 
Author 
of 
the 
world,” 
says 
Leibnitz; 
that 
refers 
directly 
to 
evil. 
It 
is 
round 
this 
relation 
that 
philosophy 
specially 
revolves, 
but 
to 
the 
unity 
of 
which 
it 
did 
not 
then 
attain; 
the 
evil 
in 
the 
world 
was 
not 
comprehended, 
because 
no 
advance 
was 
made 
beyond 
the 
fixed 
opposition. 
The 
result 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
Théodicée 
is 
an 
optimism 
supported 
on 
the 
lame 
and 
wearisome 
thought 
that 
God, 
since 
a 
world 
had 
to 
be 
brought 
into 
existence, 
chose 
out 
of 
infinitely 
many 
possible 
worlds 
the 
best 
possible 
— 
the 
most 
perfect, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
could 
be 
perfect, 
considering 
the 
finite 
element 
which 
it 
was 
to 
contain. 
This 
may 
very 
well 
be 
said 
in 
a 
general 
way, 
but 
this 
perfection 
is 
no 
determined 
thought, 
but 
a 
loose 
popular 
expression, 
a 
sort 
of 
babble 
respecting 
an 
imaginary 
or 
fanciful 
potentiality; 
Voltaire 
made 
merry 
over 
it. 
Nor 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
finite 
therein 
defined. 
Because 
the 
world, 
it 
is 
said, 
has 
to 
be 
the 
epitome 
of 
finite 
Beings, 
evil 
could 
not 
be 
separated 
from 
it, 
since 
evil 
is 
negation, 
finitude. 
Reality 
and 
negation 
remain 
standing 
in 
opposition 
to 
one 
another 
exactly 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
before. 
That 
is 
the 
principal 
conception 
in 
the 
Théodicée. 
But 
something 
very 
like 
this 
can 
be 
said 
in 
every-day 
life. 
If 
I 
have 
some 
goods 
brought 
to 
me 
in 
the 
market 
at 
some 
town, 
and 
say 
that 
they 
are 
certainly 
not 
perfect, 
but 
the 
best 
that 
are 
to 
be 
got, 
this 
is 
quite 
a 
good 
reason 
why 
I 
should 
content 
myself 
with 
them. 
But 
comprehension 
is 
a 
very 
different 
thing 
from 
this. 
Leibnitz 
says 
nothing 
further 
than 
that 
the 
world 
is 
good, 
but 
there 
is 
also 
evil 
in 
it; 
the 
matter 
remains 
just 
the 
same 
as 
it 
was 
before. 
“Because 
it 
had 
to 
be 
finite” 
is 
then 
a 



mere 
arbitrary 
choice 
on 
the 
part 
of 
God. 
The 
next 
question 
would 
be: 
Why 
and 
how 
is 
there 
finitude 
in 
the 
Absolute 
and 
His 
decrees? 
And 
only 
then 
should 
there 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
determination 
of 
finitude 
the 
evil 
which 
no 
doubtexists 
therein. 


It 
is 
true 
that 
Leibnitz 
has 
a 
reply 
to 
the 
above 
question: 
“God 
does 
not 
will 
what 
is 
evil; 
evil 
comes 
only 
indirectly 
into 
the 
results” 
(blind), 
“because 
oftentimes 
the 
greater 
good 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
if 
evils 
were 
not 
present. 
Therefore 
they 
are 
means 
to 
a 
good 
end.” 
But 
why 
does 
not 
God 
employ 
other 
means? 
They 
are 
always 
external, 
not 
in 
and 
for 
themselves. 
“A 
moral 
evil 
may 
not 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
means, 
nor 
must 
we, 
as 
the 
apostle 
says, 
do 
evil 
that 
good 
may 
come; 
yet 
ithas 
often 
the 
relation 
of 
a 
conditio 
sine 
qua 
non 
of 
the 
good. 
Evil 
is 
in 
God 
only 
the 
object 
of 
a 
permissive 
will 
(voluntatis 
permissivæ);” 
but 
everything 
that 
is 
wrong 
would 
be 
such. 
“God 
has 
therefore 
among 
the 
objects 
of 
His 
will 
the 
best 
possible 
as 
the 
ultimate 
object, 
but 
the 
good 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
choice 
(qualemcunque), 
also 
as 
subordinate; 
and 
things 
indifferent 
and 
evils 
often 
as 
means. 
Evil 
is, 
however, 
an 
object 
of 
His 
will 
only 
as 
the 
condition 
of 
something 
otherwise 
necessary 
(rei 
alioqui 
debitæ), 
which 
without 
it 
could 
not 
exist; 
in 
which 
sense 
Christ 
said 
itmustneedsbethatoffencescome.” 


In 
a 
general 
sense 
we 
are 
satisfied 
with 
the 
answer: 
“In 
accordance 
with 
the 
wisdom 
of 
God 
we 
must 
accept 
it 
as 
a 
fact 
that 
the 
laws 
of 
nature 
are 
the 
best 
possible,” 
but 
this 
answer 
does 
not 
suffice 
for 
a 
definite 
question. 
What 
one 
wishes 
to 
know 
is 
the 
goodness 
of 
this 
or 
that 
particular 
law; 
and 
to 
that 
no 
answer 
is 
given. 
If, 
for 
example, 
it 
is 
said 
that 
“The 
law 
of 
falling 
bodies, 
inwhichtherelation 
oftimeandspaceisthesquare,isthebestpossible,” 
one 
might 
employ, 
as 
far 
as 
mathematics 
are 
concerned, 
any 
other 
power 
whatever. 
When 
Leibnitz 
answers: 
“God 
made 
it 
so,” 
this 
is 
no 
answer 
at 
all. 



We 
wish 
to 
know 
the 
definite 
reason 
of 
this 
law; 
such 
general 
determinations 
soundpious,butarenotsatisfying. 


γ. 
He 
goes 
on 
to 
say 
that 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
has 
reference 
to 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
monads. 
The 
principles 
of 
things 
are 
monads, 
of 
which 
each 
is 
for 
itself, 
without 
having 
influence 
on 
the 
others. 
If 
now 
the 
Monad 
of 
monads, 
God, 
is 
the 
absolute 
substance, 
and 
individual 
monads 
are 
created 
through 
His 
will, 
their 
substantiality 
comes 
to 
an 
end. 
There 
is 
therefore 
a 
contradiction 
present, 
which 
remains 
unsolved 
in 
itself 
— 
that 
is 
between 
the 
one 
substantial 
monad 
and 
the 
many 
monads 
for 
which 
independence 
is 
claimed, 
because 
their 
essence 
consists 
in 
their 
standing 
in 
no 
relation 
to 
one 
another. 
Yet 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
in 
order 
to 
show 
the 
harmony 
that 
exists 
in 
the 
world, 
Leibnitz 
understands 
the 
relation 
of 
monads 
to 
monads 
more 
generally 
as 
the 
unity 
of 
contrasted 
existences, 
namely 
of 
soul 
and 
body. 
This 
unity 
he 
represents 
as 
a 
relation 
without 
difference, 
and 
notionless, 
i.e. 
as 
a 
preestablished 
harmony. 
Leibnitz 
uses 
here 
the 
illustration 
of 
two 
clocks, 
which 
are 
set 
to 
the 
same 
hour, 
and 
keep 
the 
same 
time; 
in 
the 
same 
way 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
kingdom 
of 
thought 
goes 
on, 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with 
ends, 
andthe 
movementonward 
of 
thecorporeal 
kingdomwhich 
corresponds 
with 
it, 
proceeds 
according 
to 
a 
general 
causal 
connection. 
The 
case 
is 
the 
sameas 
with 
Spinoza, 
that 
these 
two 
sides 
of 
the 
universe 
have 
no 
connection 
with 
each 
other, 
the 
one 
does 
not 
influence 
the 
other, 
but 
both 
are 
entirely 
indifferent 
to 
one 
another; 
it 
is 
really 
the 
differentiating 
relation 
of 
the 
Notion 
that 
is 
lacking. 
In 
abstract 
thought 
that 
is 
without 
Notion, 
that 
determination 
now 
receives 
the 
form 
of 
simplicity, 
of 
implicitude, 
of 
indifference 
with 
regard 
to 
what 
is 
other, 
of 
a 
self-reflection 
that 
has 
no 
movement: 
in 
this 
way 
redin 
theabstract 
isinaposition 
ofindifference 
asregards 
blue, 
&c. 
Here, 
as 
before, 
Leibnitz 
forsakes 
his 
principle 
of 
individuation; 
it 
has 
only 
the 
sense 
of 
being 
exclusively 
one, 
and 
of 
not 
reaching 
to 
and 
including 
what 
is 
other; 



or 
it 
is 
only 
a 
unity 
of 
the 
popular 
conception, 
not 
the 
Notion 
of 
unity. 
The 
soul 
has 
thus 
a 
series 
of 
conceptions 
and 
ideas 
which 
are 
developed 
from 
within 
it, 
and 
this 
series 
is 
from 
the 
very 
first 
placed 
within 
the 
soul 
at 
its 
creation, 
i.e. 
the 
soul 
is 
in 
all 
immediacy 
this 
implicit 
determination; 
determination 
is, 
however, 
not 
implicit, 
but 
the 
reflected 
unfolding 
of 
this 
determination 
in 
the 
ordinary 
conception 
is 
its 
outward 
existence. 
Parallel 
with 
this 
series 
of 
differentiated 
conceptions, 
there 
now 
runs 
a 
series 
of 
motions 
of 
the 
body, 
or 
of 
what 
is 
external 
to 
the 
soul. 
Both 
are 
essential 
moments 
of 
reality; 
they 
are 
mutually 
indifferent, 
but 
they 
have 
also 
an 
essentialrelationof 
difference. 


Sincenoweverymonad, 
asshut 
upwithinitself, 
hasno 
influenceuponthe 
body 
and 
its 
movements, 
and 
yet 
the 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
their 
atoms 
correspond 
with 
one 
another, 
Leibnitz 
places 
this 
harmony 
in 
God; 
a 
better 
definition 
of 
the 
relation 
and 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
Monad 
of 
monads 
is 
therefore 
that 
it 
is 
what 
pre-establishes 
harmony 
in 
the 
changes 
of 
the 
monads. 
God 
is 
the 
sufficient 
reason, 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
correspondence; 
He 
has 
so 
arranged 
the 
multitude 
of 
atoms 
that 
the 
original 
changes 
which 
are 
developed 
within 
one 
monad 
correspond 
with 
the 
changes 
of 
the 
others. 
The 
pre-established 
harmony 
is 
to 
be 
thought 
of 
somewhat 
in 
this 
style; 
when 
a 
dog 
gets 
a 
beating, 
the 
pain 
develops 
itself 
in 
him, 
in 
like 
fashion 
the 
beating 
develops 
itself 
in 
itself, 
and 
so 
does 
the 
person 
who 
administers 
the 
beating: 
their 
determinations 
all 
correspond 
with 
one 
another, 
and 
that 
not 
by 
means 
of 
their 
objective 
connection, 
since 
each 
is 
independent. 
The 
principle 
of 
the 
harmony 
among 
the 
monads 
does 
not 
consequently 
belong 
to 
them, 
but 
it 
is 
in 
God, 
who 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
is 
the 
Monad 
of 
monads, 
their 
absolute 
unity. 
We 
saw 
from 
the 
beginning 
how 
Leibnitz 
arrived 
at 
this 
conception. 
Each 
monad 
is 
really 
possessed 
of 
the 
power 
of 
representation, 
and 
is 
as 
such 
a 
representation 
of 
the 
universe, 
therefore 
implicitly 
the 
totality 
of 
the 
whole 



world. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
this 
representation 
is 
not 
in 
consciousness; 
the 
naked 
monad 
is 
implicitly 
the 
universe, 
and 
difference 
is 
the 
development 
of 
this 
totality 
in 
it. 
What 
develops 
itself 
therein 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
in 
harmony 
with 
all 
other 
developments; 
all 
is 
one 
harmony. 
“In 
the 
universe 
all 
things 
are 
closely 
knit 
together, 
they 
are 
in 
one 
piece, 
like 
an 
ocean: 
the 
slightest 
movement 
transmits 
its 
influence 
far 
and 
wide 
all 
around.” 
From 
a 
single 
grain 
of 
sand, 
Leibnitz 
holds, 
the 
whole 
universe 
might 
be 
comprehended 
in 
its 
entire 
development 
— 
if 
we 
only 
knew 
the 
sand 
grain 
thoroughly. 
There 
is 
not 
really 
much 
in 
all 
this, 
though 
it 
sounds 
very 
fine; 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
considerably 
more 
than 
a 
grain 
of 
sand, 
well 
though 
we 
knew 
it, 
and 
considerably 
different 
therefrom. 
To 
say 
that 
its 
essence 
is 
the 
universe 
is 
mere 
empty 
talk: 
for 
the 
fact 
is 
that 
the 
universe 
as 
essence 
is 
not 
the 
universe. 
To 
the 
sand 
grain 
much 
must 
be 
added 
which 
is 
not 
present; 
and 
since 
thought 
adds 
more 
than 
all 
the 
grains 
of 
sand 
that 
exist, 
the 
universe 
and 
its 
development 
may 
in 
this 
way 
certainly 
be 
comprehended. 
Thus 
according 
to 
Leibnitz 
every 
monad 
has 
or 
is 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
entire 
universe, 
which 
is 
the 
same 
as 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
really 
representation 
in 
general; 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
is 
a 
determinate 
representation, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
comes 
to 
be 
this 
particular 
monad, 
therefore 
it 
is 
representation 
accordingtoits 
particularsituationand 
circumstances. 


The 
representations 
of 
the 
monad 
in 
itself, 
which 
constitute 
its 
universe, 
develop 
themselves 
from 
themselves, 
as 
the 
spiritual 
element 
in 
it, 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
their 
own 
activity 
and 
desire, 
just 
as 
the 
movements 
of 
their 
outer 
world 
do 
according 
to 
laws 
of 
bodies; 
hence 
liberty 
is 
nothing 
other 
than 
this 
spontaneity 
of 
immanent 
development, 
but 
as 
in 
consciousness. 
The 
magnetic 
needle, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
has 
only 
spontaneity 
without 
consciousness, 
and 
consequently 
without 
freedom. 
For, 
says 
Leibnitz, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
magnetic 
needle 
is 
to 
turn 
to 
the 
north; 
if 
it 
had 
consciousness 
it 



would 
imaginethatthis 
was 
itsself-determination; 
it 
would 
thus 
have 
the 
will 
to 
move 
round 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
nature. 
But 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
in 
the 
course 
of 
conscious 
representations 
there 
is 
involved 
no 
necessary 
connection, 
but 
contingency 
and 
want 
of 
sequence 
are 
to 
be 
found, 
the 
reason 
of 
this 
according 
to 
Leibnitz 
(Oper. 
T. 
II 
P. 
I. 
) 
being 
“because 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
created 
substance 
implies 
that 
it 
changes 
incessantly 
according 
to 
a 
certain 
order, 
which 
order 
guides 
it 
spontaneously 
(spontanément) 
in 
all 
the 
circumstances 
which 
befall 
it; 
so 
that 
one 
who 
sees 
all 
things 
recognizes 
in 
the 
present 
condition 
of 
substance 
the 
past 
also 
and 
the 
future. 
The 
law 
of 
order, 
which 
determines 
the 
individuality 
of 
the 
particular 
substance, 
has 
an 
exact 
reference 
to 
what 
takes 
place 
in 
every 
other 
substance 
and 
in 
the 
whole 
universe.” 
The 
meaning 
of 
this 
is 
that 
the 
monad 
is 
not 
a 
thing 
apart, 
or 
that 
there 
are 
two 
views 
of 
it, 
the 
one 
making 
it 
out 
as 
spontaneously 
generating 
its 
representations, 
so 
far 
as 
form 
is 
concerned, 
and 
the 
other 
making 
it 
out 
to 
be 
a 
moment 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
necessity; 
Spinoza 
would 
call 
this 
regarding 
it 
from 
both 
sides. 
An 
organic 
whole, 
a 
human 
being, 
is 
thus 
for 
instance 
the 
assertion 
of 
his 
aim 
from 
out 
of 
himself: 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
being 
directed 
on 
something 
else 
is 
involved 
in 
his 
Notion. 
He 
represents 
this 
and 
that 
to 
himself, 
he 
wills 
this 
and 
that; 
his 
activity 
employs 
itself 
and 
brings 
about 
changes. 
His 
inward 
determination 
thus 
becomes 
corporeal 
determination, 
and 
then 
change 
goingbeyond 
himself;he 
appears 
as 
cause, 
influencing 
other 
monads. 
But 
this 
Being-for-another 
is 
only 
an 
appearance. 
For 
the 
other, 
i.e. 
the 
actual, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
the 
monad 
determines 
it 
or 
makes 
it 
negative, 
is 
the 
passive 
element 
which 
the 
monad 
has 
in 
itself: 
all 
moments 
are 
indeed 
contained 
therein, 
and 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
it 
has 
no 
need 
of 
other 
monads, 
but 
only 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
monads 
in 
itself. 
But 
if 
the 
Being-for-another 
is 
mere 
appearance, 
the 
same 
may 
be 
said 
of 
Being-for-self; 
for 
this 
has 
significanceonlyin 
reference 
toBeing-for-another. 



The 
important 
point 
in 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy 
is 
this 
intellectuality 
of 
representation 
which 
Leibnitz, 
however, 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
carrying 
out; 
and 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
this 
intellectuality 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
infinite 
multiplicity, 
which 
has 
remained 
absolutely 
independent, 
because 
this 
intellectuality 
has 
not 
been 
able 
to 
obtain 
mastery 
over 
the 
One. 
The 
separation 
in 
the 
Notion, 
which 
proceeds 
as 
far 
as 
release 
from 
itself, 
or 
appearance 
in 
distinct 
independence, 
Leibnitz 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
bringing 
together 
into 
unity. 
The 
harmony 
of 
these 
two 
moments, 
the 
course 
of 
mental 
representations 
andthe 
course 
of 
thingsexternal, 
appearingmutuallyascause 
and 
effect, 
is 
not 
brought 
by 
Leibnitz 
into 
relation 
in 
and 
for 
themselves; 
he 
therefore 
lets 
them 
fall 
asunder, 
although 
each 
is 
passive 
as 
regards 
the 
other. 
Hemoreover 
considers 
bothofthem 
in 
one 
unity, 
tobe 
sure,but 
their 
activity 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
not 
for 
themselves. 
Every 
forward 
advance 
becomes 
therefore 
incomprehensible 
when 
taken 
by 
itself, 
because 
the 
course 
of 
the 
representation 
as 
through 
aims 
in 
itself, 
requires 
this 
moment 
of 
Other-Being 
or 
of 
passivity; 
and 
again 
the 
connection 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
requires 
the 
universal: 
each 
however 
lacks 
this 
its 
other 
moment. 
The 
unity 
which 
according 
to 
Leibnitz 
is 
to 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
pre-established 
harmony, 
namely 
that 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
will 
of 
man 
and 
the 
outward 
change 
harmonize, 
is 
therefore 
brought 
about 
by 
means 
of 
another, 
if 
not 
indeed 
from 
without, 
for 
this 
other 
is 
God. 
Before 
God 
the 
monads 
are 
not 
to 
be 
independent,butidealandabsorbedin 
Him. 


At 
this 
point 
the 
demand 
would 
come 
in 
that 
in 
God 
Himself 
there 
should 
be 
comprehended 
the 
required 
unity 
of 
that 
which 
before 
fell 
asunder; 
and 
God 
has 
the 
special 
privilege 
of 
having 
laid 
on 
Him 
the 
burden 
of 
what 
cannot 
be 
comprehended. 
The 
word 
of 
God 
is 
thus 
the 
makeshift 
which 
leads 
to 
a 
unity 
which 
itself 
is 
only 
hypothetical; 
for 
the 
process 
of 
the 
many 
out 
of 
this 
unity 
is 
not 
demonstrated. 
God 
plays 
therefore 
in 
the 
later 
philosophy 
a 



far 
greater 
part 
than 
in 
the 
early, 
because 
now 
the 
comprehension 
of 
the 
absolute 
opposition 
of 
thought 
and 
Being 
is 
the 
chief 
demand. 
With 
Leibnitz 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
thoughts 
advance 
is 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
universe; 
where 
comprehension 
ceases, 
the 
universe 
ceases, 
and 
God 
begins: 
so 
that 
later 
it 
was 
even 
maintained 
that 
to 
be 
comprehended 
was 
derogatory 
to 
God, 
because 
He 
was 
thus 
degraded 
into 
finitude. 
In 
that 
procedure 
a 
beginning 
is 
made 
from 
the 
determinate, 
this 
and 
that 
are 
stated 
to 
be 
necessary; 
but 
since 
in 
the 
next 
place 
the 
unity 
of 
these 
moments 
is 
not 
comprehended, 
it 
is 
transferred 
to 
God. 
God 
is 
therefore, 
as 
it 
were, 
the 
waste 
channel 
into 
which 
all 
contradictions 
flow: 
Leibnitz’s 
Théodicée 
is 
just 
a 
popular 
summing 
up 
such 
as 
this. 
There 
are, 
nevertheless, 
all 
manner 
of 
evasions 
to 
be 
searched 
out 
— 
in 
the 
opposition 
of 
God’s 
justice 
and 
mercy, 
that 
the 
one 
tempers 
the 
other; 
how 
the 
fore-knowledge 
of 
God 
and 
human 
freedom 
are 
compatible 
— 
all 
manner 
of 
syntheses 
which 
never 
come 
to 
the 
root 
of 
the 
matter 
nor 
show 
bothsides 
tobemoments. 


These 
are 
the 
main 
moments 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy. 
It 
is 
a 
metaphysic 
which 
starts 
from 
a 
narrow 
determination 
of 
the 
understanding, 
namely, 
from 
absolute 
multiplicity, 
so 
that 
connection 
can 
only 
be 
grasped 
as 
continuity. 
Thereby 
absolute 
unity 
is 
certainly 
set 
aside, 
but 
all 
the 
same 
it 
is 
presupposed; 
and 
the 
association 
of 
individuals 
with 
one 
another 
is 
to 
be 
explained 
only 
in 
this 
way, 
that 
it 
is 
God 
who 
determines 
the 
harmony 
in 
the 
changes 
of 
individuals. 
This 
is 
an 
artificial 
system, 
which 
is 
founded 
on 
a 
category 
of 
the 
understanding, 
that 
of 
the 
absoluteness 
of 
abstract 
individuality. 
What 
is 
of 
importance 
in 
Leibnitz 
lies 
in 
the 
maxims, 
in 
the 
principleof 
individualityandthemaximof 
indistinguishability. 



Gottfried 
Wilhelm 
von 
Leibnitz 
(1858)by 
Frederic 


Henry 
Hedge 



From 
‘The 
Atlantic 
Monthly’ 


The 
philosophic 
import 
of 
this 
illustrious 
name, 
having 
suffered 
temporary 
eclipse 
from 
the 
Critical 
Philosophy, 
with 
its 
swift 
succession 
of 
transcendental 
dynasties, 
— 
the 
Wissenschaftslehre, 
the 
Naturphilosophie, 
and 
the 
Encyclopädie, 
— 
has 
recently 
emerged 
into 
clear 
and 
respectful 
recognition, 
if 
not 
into 
broad 
and 
effulgent 
repute. 
In 
divers 
quarters, 
of 
late, 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
learned 
has 
reverted 
to 
the 
splendid 
optimist, 
whose 
adventurous 
intellect 
left 
nothing 
unexplored 
and 
almost 
nothing 
unexplained. 
Biographers 
and 
critics 
have 
discussed 
his 
theories, 
— 
some 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
philosophy, 
and 
some 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
religion, 
— 
some 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
discipleship, 
and 
some 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
opposition, 
— 
but 
all 
with 
consenting 
and 
admiring 
attestation 
of 
the 
vast 
erudition 
and 
intellectual 
prowessand 
unsurpassed 
capacity1ofthe 
man. 


A 
collection 
of 
all 
the 
works 
appertaining 
to 
Leibnitz, 
with 
all 
his 
own 
writings, 
would 
make 
a 
respectable 
library. 
We 
have 
no 
room 
for 
the 
titles 
of 
all, 
even 
of 
the 
more 
recent 
of 
these 
publications. 
We 
content 
ourselves 
with 
naming 
the 
Biography, 
by 
G. 
G. 
Guhrauer, 
the 
best 
that 
has 
yet 
appeared, 
called 
forth 
by 
the 
celebration, 
in 
1846, 
of 
the 
ducentesimal 
birthday 
of 
Leibnitz, 
— 
the 
latest 
edition 
of 
his 
Philosophical 
Works, 
by 
Professor 
Erdmann 
of 
Halle 
— 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
Correspondence 
with 
Arnauld, 
by 
Herr 
Grotefend, 
and 
of 
that 
with 
the 
Landgrave 
Ernst 
von 
Hessen 
Rheinfels, 
by 
Chr. 
von 
Rommel, 
— 
of 
his 
Historical 
Works, 
by 
the 
librarian 
Pertz 
of 
Berlin, 
— 
of 
the 
Mathematical, 
by 
Gerhardt, 
— 
Ludwig 
Jeuerbach’s 



elaborate 
dissertation, 
“Darstellung, 
Entwickelung 
und 
Kritik 
der 
Leibnitzischen 
Philosophie,” 
— 
Zimmermann’s 
“Leibnitz 
u. 
Herbart’s 
Monadologie,” 
— 
Schelling’s 
“Leibnitz 
als 
Denker,” 
— 
Hartenstein’s 
“De 
Materiae 
apud 
Leibnit. 
Notione,” 
— 
and 
Adolph 
Helferich’s 
“Spinoza 
u. 
Leibnitz: 
oder 
Das 
Wesen 
des 
Idealismus 
u. 
des 
Realismus.” 
To 
these 
we 
must 
add, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
valuable 
contributions 
to 
Leibnitian 
literature, 


M. 
Foucher 
de 
Careil’s 
recent 
publication 
of 
certain 
MSS. 
of 
Leibnitz, 
found 
in 
the 
library 
at 
Hanover, 
containing 
strictures 
on 
Spinoza, 
(which 
the 
editor 
takes 
the 
liberty 
to 
call 
“Refutation 
Inédite 
de 
Spinoza,”)— 
“Sentiment 
de 
Worcester 
et 
de 
Locke 
sur 
les 
Idées,”— 
“Correspondance 
avec 
Foucher, 
Bayle 
et 
Fontenelle,”— 
“Reflexions 
sur 
l’Art 
de 
connaître 
les 
Homines,”— 
“Fragmens 
Divers,” 
etc.2, 
accompanied 
by 
valuable 
introductory 
and 
critical 
essays. 
M. 
de 
Careil 
complains 
that 
France 
has 
done 
so 
little 
for 
the 
memory 
of 
a 
man 
“qui 
lui 
a 
fait 
l’honneur 
d’écrire 
les 
deux 
tiers 
de 
ses 
oeuvres 
en 
Français.” 
England 
does 
not 
owe 
him 
the 
same 
obligations, 
and 
England 
has 
done 
far 
less 
than 
France, 
— 
in 
fact, 
nothing 
to 
illustrate 
the 
memory 
of 
Leibnitz; 
not 
so 
much 
as 
an 
English 
translation 
of 
his 
works, 
or 
an 
English 
edition 
of 
them, 
in 
these 
two 
centuries. 
Nor 
have 
M. 
de 
Careil’s 
countrymen 
in 
times 
past 
shared 
all 
his 
enthusiasm 
for 
the 
genial 
Saxon. 
The 
barren 
Psychology 
of 
Locke 
obtained 
a 
currency 
in 
France, 
in 
the 
last 
century, 
which 
the 
friendly 
Realism 
of 
his 
great 
contemporary 
could 
never 
boast. 
Raspe, 
the 
first 
who 
edited 
the 
“Nouveaux 
Essais,” 
takes 
to 
himself 
no 
small 
credit 
for 
liberality 
in 
so 
doing, 
and 
hopes, 
by 
rendering 
equal 
justice 
to 
Leibnitz 
and 
to 
Locke, 
to 
conciliate 
those 
“who, 
with 
the 
former, 
think 
that 
their 
wisdom 
is 
the 
sure 
measure 
of 
omnipotence,”3 
and 
those 
who 
“believe, 
with 
the 
latter, 
that 
the 
human 
mind 
is 
to 
the 
rays 
of 
the 
primal 
Truth 
what 
a 
night-birdis 
tothesun.”4 

Voltaire 
pronounced 
him 
“le 
savant 
le 
plus 
universel 
de 
l’Europe,” 
but 
characterized 
his 
metaphysical 
labors 
with 
the 
somewhat 
equivocal 
compliment 
of 
“metaphysicien 
assez 
délié 
pour 
vouloir 
réconcilier 
la 
théologieaveclamétaphysique.”5 


Germany, 
with 
all 
her 
wealth 
of 
erudite 
celebrities, 
has 
produced 
no 
other 
who 
fulfils 
so 
completely 
the 
type 
of 
the 
Gelehrte, 
— 
a 
type 
which 
differs 
from 
that 
of 
the 
savant 
and 
from 
that 
of 
the 
scholar, 
but 
includes 
them 
both. 
Feuerbach 
calls 
him 
“the 
personified 
thirst 
for 
Knowledge”; 
Frederic 
the 
Great 
pronounced 
him 
an 
“Academy 
of 
Sciences”; 
and 
Fontenelle 
said 
of 
him, 
that 
“he 
saw 
the 
end 
of 
things, 
or 
that 
they 
had 
no 
end.” 
It 
was 
an 
age 
of 
intellectual 
adventure 
into 
which 
Leibnitz 
was 
born, 
— 
fit 
sequel 
and 
heir 
to 
the 
age 
of 
maritime 
adventure 
which 
preceded 
it. 
We 
please 
ourselves 
with 
fancied 
analogies 
between 
the 
two 
epochs 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
discoveries. 
In 
the 
latter 
movement, 
as 
in 
the 
former, 
Italy 
took 
the 
lead. 
The 
martyr 
Giordano 
Bruno 
was 
thebrave 
Columbus 
of 
modern 
thought, 
—the 
first 
who 
broke 
loose 
from 
the 
trammels 
of 
mediaeval 
ecclesiastical 
tradition, 
and 
reported 
a 
new 
world 
beyond 
the 
watery 
waste 
of 
scholasticism. 
Campanella 
may 
represent 
the 
Vespucci 
of 
the 
new 
enterprise; 
Lord 
Bacon 
its 
Sebastian 
Cabot, 
— 
the 
“Novum 
Organum” 
being 
the 
Newfoundland 
of 
modern 
experimental 
science. 
Des 
Cartes 
was 
the 
Cortés, 
or 
shall 
we 
rather 
say 
the 
Ponce 
de 
Leon, 
of 
scientific 
discovery, 
who, 
failing 
to 
find 
what 
he 
sought, 


— 
the 
Principle 
of 
Life, 
(the 
Fountain 
of 
Eternal 
Youth,) 
— 
yet 
found 
enough 
to 
render 
his 
name 
immortal 
and 
to 
make 
mankind 
his 
debtor. 
Spinoza 
is 
the 
spiritual 
Magalhaens, 
who, 
emerging 
from 
the 
straits 
of 
Judaism,beheld 
“Anotherocean’sbreastimmense,unknown.” 
Ofmodernthinkershewas 



—— 
— 
“thefirst 
Thateverburst 
Into 
thatsilentsea.” 


He 
discovered 
the 
Pacific 
of 
philosophy, 
— 
that 
theory 
of 
the 
sole 
Divine 
Substance, 
the 
All-One, 
which 
Goethe 
in 
early 
life 
found 
so 
pacifying 
to 
his 
troubled 
spirit, 
and 
which, 
vague 
and 
barren 
as 
it 
proves 
on 
nearer 
acquaintance, 
induces 
at 
first, 
above 
all 
other 
systems, 
a 
sense 
of 
repose 
in 
illimitable 
vastnessandimmutable 
necessity. 


But 
the 
Vasco 
de 
Gama 
of 
his 
day 
was 
Leibnitz. 
His 
triumphant 
optimism 
rounded 
the 
Cape 
of 
theological 
Good 
Hope. 
He 
gave 
the 
chief 
impulse 
to 
modern 
intellectual 
commerce. 
Full 
freighted, 
as 
he 
was, 
with 
Western 
thought, 
he 
revived 
the 
forgotten 
interest 
in 
the 
Old 
and 
Eastern 
World, 
and 
brought 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
earth 
together. 
Circumnavigator 
of 
the 
realms 
of 
mind, 
wherever 
he 
touched, 
he 
appeared 
as 
discoverer, 
as 
conqueror, 
as 
lawgiver. 
In 
mathematics, 
he 
discovered 
or 
invented 
the 
Differential 
Calculus, 
— 
the 
logic 
of 
transcendental 
analysis, 
the 
infallible 
method 
of 
astronomy, 
without 
which 
it 
could 
never 
have 
compassed 
the 
large 
conclusions 
of 
the 
“Mecanique 
Celeste.” 
In 
his 
“Protogaea,” 
published 
in 
1693, 
he 
laid 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
science 
of 
Geology. 
From 
his 
observations, 
as 
Superintendent 
of 
the 
Hartz 
Mines, 
and 
those 
which 
he 
made 
in 
his 
subsequent 
travels 
through 
Austria 
and 
Italy, 
— 
from 
an 
from 
an 
examination 
of 
the 
layers, 
in 
different 
localities, 
of 
the 
earth’s 
crust, 
he 
deduced 
the 
first 
theory, 
in 
the 
geological 
sense, 
which 
has 
ever 
been 
propounded, 
of 
the 
earth’s 
formation. 
Orthodox 
Lutheran 
as 
he 
was, 
he 
braved 
the 
theological 
prejudices 
which 
then, 
even 
more 
than 
now, 
affronted 
scientific 
inquiry 
in 
that 
direction. 
“First 
among 
men,” 
says 
Flourens, 
“he 
demonstrated 
the 
two 
agencies 
which 
successively 
have 
formed 
and 
reformed 
the 
globe, 
— 
fire 
and 
water.” 
In 
the 
region 
of 
metaphysical 
inquiry, 
he 



propounded 
a 
new 
and 
original 
theory 
of 
Substance, 
and 
gave 
to 
philosophy 
the 
Monad, 
the 
Law 
of 
Continuity, 
the 
Preëstablished 
Harmony, 
and 
the 
Best 
PossibleWorld. 


Born 
at 
Leipzig, 
in 
1646, 
— 
left 
fatherless 
at 
the 
age 
of 
six 
years, 
— 
by 
the 
care 
of 
a 
pious 
mother 
and 
competent 
guardians, 
young 
Leibnitz 
enjoyed 
such 
means 
of 
education 
as 
Germany 
afforded 
at 
that 
time, 
but 
declares 
himself,forthemostpart,self-taught.6 


So 
genius 
must 
always 
be, 
for 
want 
of 
any 
external 
stimulus 
equal 
to 
its 
own 
impulse. 
No 
normal 
training 
could 
keep 
pace 
with 
his 
abnormal 
growth. 
No 
school 
discipline 
could 
supply 
the 
fuel 
necessary 
to 
feed 
the 
consuming 
fire 
of 
that 
ravenous 
intellect. 
Grammars, 
manuals, 
compends, 
— 
all 
the 
apparatus 
of 
the 
classes, 
— 
were 
only 
oil 
to 
its 
flame. 
The 
Master 
of 
the 
Nicolai-Schule 
in 
Leipzig, 
his 
first 
instructor, 
was 
a 
steady 
practitioner 
of 
the 
Martinet 
order. 
The 
pupils 
were 
ranged 
in 
classes 
corresponding 
to 
their 
civil 
ages, 
— 
their 
studies 
graduated 
according 
to 
the 
baptismal 
register. 
It 
was 
not 
a 
question 
of 
faculty 
or 
proficiency, 
how 
a 
lad 
should 
be 
classed 
and 
what 
he 
should 
read, 
but 
of 
calendar 
years. 
As 
if 
a 
shoemaker 
should 
fit 
his 
last 
to 
the 
age 
instead 
of 
the 
foot. 
Such 
an 
age, 
such 
a 
study. 
Gottfried 
is 
a 
genius, 
and 
Hans 
is 
a 
dunce; 
but 
Gottfried 
and 
Hans 
were 
both 
born 
in 
1646; 
consequently, 
now, 
in 
1654, 
they 
are 
both 
equally 
fit 
for 
the 
Smaller 
Catechism. 
Leibnitz 
was 
ready 
for 
Latin 
long 
before 
the 
time 
allotted 
to 
that 
study 
in 
the 
Nicolai-Schule, 
but 
the 
system 
was 
inexorable. 
All 
access 
to 
books 
cut 
off 
by 
rigorous 
proscription. 
But 
the 
thirst 
for 
knowledge 
is 
not 
easily 
stifled,andgenius,likelove, 
“willfind 
outhisway.” 


He 
chanced, 
in 
a 
corner 
of 
the 
house, 
to 
light 
on 
an 
odd 
volume 
of 
Livy, 
left 
there 
by 
some 
student 
boarder. 
What 
could 
Livy 
do 
for 
a 
child 
of 
eight 
years, 
with 
no 
previous 
knowledge 
of 
Latin, 
and 
no 
lexicon 
to 
interpret 



between 
them? 
For 
most 
children, 
nothing. 
Not 
one 
in 
a 
thousand 
would 
have 
dreamed 
of 
seriously 
grappling 
with 
such 
a 
mystery. 
But 
the 
brave 
Patavinian 
took 
pity 
on 
our 
little 
one 
and 
yielded 
something 
to 
childish 
importunity. 
The 
quaint 
old 
copy 
was 
garnished, 
according 
to 
a 
fashion 
of 
the 
time, 
with 
rude 
wood-cuts, 
having 
explanatory 
legends 
underneath. 
The 
young 
philologer 
tugged 
at 
these 
until 
he 
had 
mastered 
one 
or 
two 
words. 
Then 
the 
book 
was 
thrown 
by 
in 
despair 
as 
impracticable 
to 
further 
investigation. 
Then, 
after 
one 
or 
two 
weeks 
had 
elapsed, 
for 
want 
of 
other 
employment, 
it 
was 
taken 
up 
again, 
and 
a 
little 
more 
progress 
made. 
And 
so 
by 
degrees, 
in 
the 
course 
of 
a 
year, 
a 
considerable 
knowledge 
of 
Latin 
had 
been 
achieved. 
But 
when, 
in 
the 
Nicolai 
order, 
the 
time 
for 
this 
study 
arrived, 
so 
far 
from 
being 
pleased 
to 
find 
his 
instructions 
anticipated, 
or 
welcoming 
such 
promise 
of 
future 
greatness, 
— 
so 
far 
from 
rejoicing 
in 
his 
pupil’s 
proficiency, 
the 
pedagogue 
chafedat 
the 
insultofferedtohissystembythisempiricantepast. 
Hewaslike

or

which,

(unknown 
to 
him) 
already 
full, 
runs 
over, 
and 
his 
oil 
is 
spilled. 
It 
was 
“oleum 
perdidit” 
in 
another 
sense 
than 
the 
scholastic 
one. 
Complaint 
was 
made 
to 
the 
guardians 
of 
the 
orphan 
Gottfried 
of 
these 
illicit 
visits 
to 
the 
tree 
of 
knowledge. 
Severe 
prohibitory 
measures 
were 
recommended, 
which, 
however,judiciouscounselfromanotherquarterhappilyaverted. 


At 
the 
age 
of 
eleven, 
Leibnitz 
records, 
that 
he 
made, 
on 
one 
occasion, 
three 
hundred 
Latin 
verses 
without 
elision 
between 
breakfast 
and 
dinner. 
A 
hundred 
hexameters, 
or 
fifty 
distichs, 
in 
a 
day, 
is 
generally 
considered 
a 
fair 
pensum 
foraboy 
ofsixteenataGermangymnasium. 


At 
the 
age 
of 
seventeen, 
he 
produced, 
as 
an 
academic 
exercise, 
on 
taking 
the 
degree 
of 
Bachelor 
of 
Philosophy, 
his 
celebrated 
treatise 
on 
the 
Principle 
of 
Individuality, 
“De 
Principle 
Individui,” 
the 
most 
extraordinary 



performance 
ever 
achieved 
by 
a 
youth 
of 
that 
age, 
— 
remarkable 
for 
its 
erudition, 
especially 
its 
intimate 
knowledge 
of 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
Schoolmen, 
and 
equally 
remarkable 
for 
its 
vigorous 
grasp 
of 
thought 
and 
its 
subtile 
analysis. 
InthisessayLeibnitz 
discoveredthebentof 
his 
mindand 
prefigured 
hisfuture 
philosophy, 
inthechoiceof 
his 
theme,andin 
his 
vivid 
appreciation 
and 
strenuous 
positing 
of 
the 
individual 
as 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
ontology. 
He 
takes 
Nominalistic 
ground 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
old 
controversy 
of 
Nominalist 
and 
Realist, 
siding 
with 
Abelard 
and 
Roscellin 
and 
Occam, 
and 
against 
St. 
Thomas 
and 
Duns 
Scotus. 
The 
principle 
of 
individuation, 
he 
maintains, 
is 
the 
entire 
entity 
of 
the 
individual, 
and 
not 
mere 
limitation 
of 
the 
universal, 
whether 
by 
“Existence” 
or 
by 
“Haecceity.”7 
John 
and 
Thomas 
are 
individuals 
by 
virtue 
of 
their 
integral 
humanity, 
and 
not 
by 
fractional 
limitation 
of 
humanity. 
Dobbin 
is 
an 
actual 
positive 
horse 
(Entitas 
tota). 
Not 
a 
negation, 
by 
limitation, 
of 
universal 
equiety 
(Negatio). 
Not 
an 
individuation, 
by 
actual 
existence, 
of 
a 
non-existent 
but 
essential 
and 
universal 
horse 
(Existentia). 
Nor 
yet 
a 
horse 
only 
by 
limitation 
of 
kind, 
— 
a 
horse 
minus 
Dick 
and 
Bessie 
and 
the 
brown 
mare, 
etc. 
(Haecceitas). 
But 
an 
individual 
horse, 
simply 
by 
virtue 
of 
his 
equine 
nature. 
Only 
so 
far 
as 
he 
is 
an 
actual 
complete 
horse, 
is 
he 
an 
individual 
at 
all. 
(Per 
quod 
quid 
est, 
per 
id 
unum 
numero 
est.) 
His 
individuality 
is 
nothing 
superadded 
to 
his 
equiety. 
(Unum 
supra 
ens 
nihil 
addit 
reale.) 
Neither 
is 
it 
anything 
subtracted 
therefrom. 
(Negatio 
non 
potest 
producere 
accidentia 
individualia.) 
In 
fine, 
there 
is 
and 
can 
be 
no 
horse 
but 
actual 
individual 
horses. 
(Essentia 
et 
existentia 
non 
possunt 
separari.) 


This 
was 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Nominalists, 
as 
it 
was 
of 
Aristotle 
before 
them. 
It 
was 
the 
doctrineof 
theReformers, 
except, 
if 
weremember 
rightly, 
of 
Huss. 
The 
University 
of 
Leipzig 
was 
founded 
upon 
it. 
It 
is 
the 
current 
doctrine 
of 
the 
present 
day, 
and 
harmonizes 
well 
with 
the 
current 



Materialism. 
Not 
that 
Nominalism 
in 
itself, 
and 
as 
Leibnitz 
held 
it, 
is 
necessarily 
materialistic, 
but 
Realism 
is 
essentially 
antimaterialistic. 
The 
Realists 
held 
with 
Plato, 
— 
but 
not 
in 
his 
name, 
for 
they, 
too, 
claimed 
to 
be 
Aristotelian, 
and 
preëminently 
so, 
— 
that 
the 
ideal 
must 
precede 
the 
actual. 
So 
far 
they 
were 
right. 
This 
was 
their 
strong 
point. 
Their 
error 
lay 
in 
claiming 
for 
the 
ideal 
an 
objective 
reality, 
an 
independent 
being. 
Conceptualism 
was 
only 
another 
statement 
of 
Nominalism, 
or, 
at 
most, 
a 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
language 
to 
thought. 
It 
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
third 
issue 
in 
this 
controversy, 
— 
a 
controversy 
in 
which 
more 
time 
was 
consumed, 
says 
John 
of 
Salisbury, 
“than 
the 
Caesars 
required 
to 
make 
themselves 
masters 
of 
the 
world,” 
and 
in 
which 
thecombatants,havingspent 
at 
last 
their 
whole 
stock 
of 
dialectic 
ammunition, 
resorted 
to 
carnal 
weapons, 
passing 
suddenly, 
by 
a 
very 
illogical 
metabasis, 
from 
“universals” 
to 
particulars. 
Both 
parties 
appealed 
to 
Aristotle. 
By 
a 
singular 
fortune, 
a 
pagan 
philosopher, 
introduced 
into 
Western 
Europe 
by 
Mohammedans, 
became 
the 
supreme 
authority 
of 
the 
Christian 
world. 
Aristotle 
was 
the 
Scripture 
of 
the 
Middle 
Age. 
Luther 
found 
this 
authority 
in 
his 
way 
and 
disposed 
of 
it 
in 
short 
order, 
devoting 
Aristotle 
without 
ceremony 
to 
the 
Devil, 
as 
“a 
damned 
mischief-making 
heathen.” 
But 
Leibnitz, 
whose 
large 
discourse 
looked 
before 
as 
well 
as 
after, 
reinstated 
not 
onlyAristotle,butPlato,andothers 
oftheGreekphilosophers,intheirformer 
repute;— 
“Car 
ces 
anciens,” 
he 
said, 
“étaient 
plus 
solides 
qu’on 
ne 
croit.” 
He 
was 
thefirsttoturnthe 
tideof 
popular 
opinion 
intheirfavor. 


Not 
without 
a 
struggle 
was 
he 
brought 
to 
side 
with 
the 
Nominalists. 
Musing, 
when 
a 
boy, 
in 
the 
Rosenthal, 
near 
Leipzig, 
he 
debated 
long 
with 
himself,— 
“Whether 
he 
would 
give 
up 
the 
Substantial 
Forms 
of 
the 
Schoolmen.” 
Strange 
matter 
for 
boyish 
deliberation! 
Yes, 
good 
youth, 
by 
all 
means, 
give 
them 
up! 
They 
have 
had 
their 
day. 
They 
served 
to 
amuse 
the 
imprisoned 
intellect 
of 
Christendom 
in 
times 
of 
ecclesiastical 
thraldom, 
when 



learning 
knew 
no 
other 
vocation. 
But 
the 
age 
into 
which 
you 
are 
born 
has 
its 
own 
problems, 
of 
nearer 
interest 
and 
more 
commanding 
import. 
The 
measuring-reed 
of 
science 
is 
to 
be 
laid 
to 
the 
heavens, 
the 
solar 
system 
is 
to 
be 
weighed 
in 
a 
balance; 
the 
age 
of 
logical 
quiddities 
has 
passed, 
the 
age 
of 
mathematical 
quantities 
has 
come. 
Give 
them 
up! 
You 
will 
soon 
have 
enough 
to 
do 
to 
take 
care 
of 
your 
own. 
What 
with 
Dynamics 
and 
Infinitesimals, 
Pasigraphy 
and 
Dyadik, 
Monads 
and 
Majesties, 
Concilium 
Ægyptiacum 
and 
Spanish 
Succession 
and 
Hanoverian 
cabals, 
there 
will 
be 
scant 
room 
in 
that 
busy 
brain 
for 
Substantial 
Forms. 
Let 
them 
sleep, 
dust 
to 
dust, 
with 
the 
tomes 
ofDunsScotusand 
the 
bonesofAquinas! 


The 
“De 
Principio 
Individui” 
was 
the 
last 
treatise 
of 
any 
note 
in 
the 
sense 
and 
style 
of 
the 
old 
scholastic 
philosophy. 
It 
was 
also 
one 
of 
the 
last 
blows 
aimed 
at 
scholasticism, 
which, 
long 
undermined 
by 
the 
Saxon 
Reformation, 
received 
its 
coup 
de 
grace 
a 
century 
later 
from 
the 
pen 
of 
an 
English 
wit. 
“Cornelius,” 
says 
the 
author 
of 
“Martinus 
Scriblerus,” 
told 
Martin 
that 
a 
shoulder 
of 
mutton 
was 
an 
individual; 
which 
Crambe 
denied, 
for 
he 
had 
seen 
it 
cut 
into 
commons. 
‘That’s 
true,’ 
quoth 
the 
Tutor, 
‘but 
you 
never 
saw 
it 
cut 
into 
shoulders 
of 
mutton.’ 
‘If 
it 
could 
be,’ 
quoth 
Crambe, 
‘it 
would 
be 
the 
loveliestindividualofthe 
University.’ 
Whenhewas 
toldthata 
substance 
was 
that 
which 
is 
subject 
to 
accidents: 
‘Then 
soldiers,’ 
quoth 
Crambe, 
‘are 
the 
most 
substantial 
people 
in 
the 
world.’ 
Neither 
would 
he 
allow 
it 
to 
be 
a 
good 
definition 
of 
accident, 
that 
it 
could 
be 
present 
or 
absent 
without 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
subject, 
since 
there 
are 
a 
great 
many 
accidents 
that 
destroy 
the 
subject, 
as 
burning 
does 
a 
house 
and 
death 
a 
man. 
But 
as 
to 
that, 
Cornelius 
informed 
him 
that 
there 
was 
a 
natural 
death 
and 
a 
logical 
death; 
and 
that 
though 
a 
man 
after 
his 
natural 
death 
was 
incapable 
of 
the 
least 
parish

Crambe 
regretted 
extremely 
that 
Substantial 
Forms, 
a 
race 
of 
harmless 
beings 
which 
had 
lasted 
for 
many 
years 
and 
had 
afforded 
a 
comfortable 
subsistence 
to 
many 
poor 
philosophers, 
should 
now 
be 
hunted 
down 
like 
so 
many 
wolves, 
without 
the 
possibility 
of 
retreat. 
He 
considered 
that 
it 
had 
gone 
much 
harder 
with 
them 
than 
with 
the 
Essences, 
which 
had 
retired 
from 
the 
schools 
into 
the 
apothecaries’ 
shops, 
where 
some 
of 
them 
had 
been 
advanced 
into 
the 
degree 
of 
Quintessences. 
He 
thought 
there 
should 
be 
a 
retreat 
for 
poor 
substantial 
forms 
amongst 
the 
gentlemen-ushers 
at 
court; 
and 
that 
there 
were, 
indeed, 
substantial 
forms, 
such 
as 
forms 
of 
prayer 
and 
forms 
of 
government, 
without 
which 
the 
things 
themselves 
could 
never 
long 
subsist..... 


Metaphysics 
were 
a 
large 
field 
in 
which 
to 
exercise 
the 
weapons 
which 
logic 
had 
put 
in 
their 
hands. 
Here 
Martin 
and 
Crambe 
used 
to 
engage 
like 
any 
prizefighters. 
And 
as 
prize-fighters 
will 
agree 
to 
lay 
aside 
a 
buckler, 
or 
some 
such 
defensive 
weapon, 
so 
Crambe 
would 
agree 
not 
to 
use 
simpliciter 
and 
secundum 
quid, 
if 
Martin 
would 
part 
with 
materialiter 
and 
formaliter. 
But 
it 
was 
found, 
that, 
without 
the 
defensive 
armor 
of 
these 
distinctions, 
the 
arguments 
cut 
so 
deep 
that 
they 
fetched 
blood 
at 
every 
stroke. 
Their 
theses 
were 
picked 
out 
of 
Suarez, 
Thomas 
Aquinas, 
and 
other 
learned 
writers 
on 
those 
subjects..... 
One, 
particularly, 
remains 
undecided 
to 
this 
day,— 
‘An 
præter 
esse 
reale 
actualis 
essentiæ 
sit 
alind 
esse 
necessarium 
quo 
res 
actualiter 
existat?’ 
In 
English 
thus: 
‘Whether, 
besides 
the 
real 
being 
of 
actual 
being,therebeanyotherbeingnecessarytocauseathingtobe?’8 


Arrived 
at 
maturity, 
Leibnitz 
rose 
at 
once 
to 
classic 
eminence. 
He 
became 
a 
conspicuous 
figure, 
he 
became 
a 
commanding 
power, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
intellectual 
world, 
of 
which 
he 
constituted 
himself 
the 
centre, 
but 
in 
part 
also 
of 
the 
civil. 
It 
lay 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
his 
genius 
to 
prove 
all 
things, 
and 
it 
lay 
in 
his 
temperament 
to 
seek 
rapport 
with 
all 
sorts 
of 
men. 
He 
was 
infinitely 



related; 
— 
not 
an 
individual 
of 
note 
in 
his 
day 
but 
was 
linked 
with 
him 
by 
some 
common 
interest 
or 
some 
polemic 
grapple; 
not 
a 
savant 
or 
statesman 
with 
whom 
Leibnitz 
did 
not 
spin, 
on 
one 
pretence 
or 
another, 
a 
thread 
of 
communication. 
Europe 
was 
reticulated 
with 
the 
meshes 
of 
his 
correspondence. 
“Never,” 
says 
Voltaire, 
“was 
intercourse 
among 
philosophers 
more 
universal; 
Leibnitz 
servait 
à 
l’animer.” 
He 
writes 
now 
to 
Spinoza 
at 
the 
Hague, 
to 
suggest 
new 
methods 
of 
manufacturing 
lenses, 
— 
now 
to 
Magliabecchi 
at 
Florence, 
urging, 
in 
elegant 
Latin 
verses, 
the 
publication 
of 
his 
bibliographical 
discoveries, 
— 
and 
now 
to 
Grimaldi, 
Jesuit 
missionary 
in 
China, 
to 
communicate 
his 
researches 
in 
Chinese 
philosophy. 
He 
hoped 
by 
means 
of 
the 
latter 
to 
operate 
on 
the 
Emperor 
Cham-Hi 
with 
the 
Dyadik;9 
and 
even 
suggested 
said 
Dyadik 
as 
a 
key 
to 
the 
cipher 
of 
the 
book 
“Ye 
Kim,” 
supposed 
to 
contain 
the 
sacred 
mysteries 
of 
Fo. 
He 
addresses 
Louis 
XIV. 
now 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
military 
expedition 
to 
Egypt, 
(a 
magnificent 
idea, 
which 
it 
needed 
a 
Napoleon 
to 
realize,) 
now 
on 
the 
best 
method 
of 
promoting 
and 
conserving 
scientific 
knowledge. 
He 
corresponds 
with 
the 
Landgrave 
of 
Hesse-Rheinfels, 
with 
Bossuet, 
and 
with 
Madame 
Brinon 
on 
the 
Union 
of 
theCatholicand 
Protestant 
Churches, 
andwith 
Privy-
Counsellor 
von 
Spanheim 
on 
the 
Union 
of 
the 
Lutheran 
and 
Reformed, 
— 
with 
Père 
Des 
Bosses 
on 
Transubstantiation, 
and 
with 
Samuel 
Clarke 
on 
Time 
and 
Space, 
— 
with 
Remond 
de 
Montmort 
on 
Plato, 
and 
with 
Franke 
on 
Popular 
Education, 
— 
with 
the 
Queen 
of 
Prussia 
(his 
pupil) 
on 
Free-will 
and 
Predestination, 
and 
with 
the 
Electress 
Sophia, 
her 
mother, 
(in 
her 
eighty-
fourth 
year,) 
on 
English 
Politics, 
— 
with 
the 
cabinet 
of 
Peter 
the 
Great 
on 
the 
Slavonic 
and 
Oriental 
Languages, 
and 
with 
that 
of 
the 
German 
Emperor 
on 
the 
claims 
of 
George 
Lewis 
to 
the 
honors 
of 
the 
Electorate,

finally,

Of 
this 
world-wide 
correspondence 
a 
portion 
related 
to 
the 
sore 
subject 
of 
his 
litigated 
claim 
to 
originality 
in 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
Differential 
Calculus, 


— 
a 
matter 
in 
which 
Leibnitz 
felt 
himself 
grievously 
wronged, 
and 
complained 
with 
justice 
of 
the 
treatment 
he 
received 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
his 
contemporaries. 
The 
controversy 
between 
him 
and 
Newton, 
respecting 
this 
hateful 
topic, 
would 
never 
have 
originated 
with 
either 
of 
these 
illustrious 
men, 
had 
it 
depended 
on 
them 
alone 
to 
vindicate 
their 
respective 
claims. 
Officious 
and 
ill-advised 
friends 
of 
the 
English 
philosopher, 
partly 
from 
misguided 
zeal 
and 
partly 
from 
levelled 
malice, 
preferred 
on 
his 
behalf 
a 
charge 
of 
plagiarism 
against 
the 
German, 
which 
Newton 
was 
not 
likely 
to 
have 
urged 
for 
himself. 
“The 
new 
Calculus, 
which 
Europe 
lauds, 
is 
nothing 
less,” 
they 
suggested, 
“than 
your 
fluxionary 
method, 
which 
Mr. 
Leibnitz 
has 
pirated, 
anticipating 
its 
tardy 
publication 
by 
the 
genuine 
author. 
Why 
suffer 
your 
laurels 
to 
be 
wrested 
from 
you 
by 
a 
stranger?” 
Thereupon 
arose 
the 
notorious 
Commercium 
Epistolicum, 
in 
which 
Wallis, 
Fatio 
de 
Duillier, 
Collins, 
and 
Keill 
were 
perversely 
active. 
Melancholy 
monument 
of 
literary 
and 
national 
jealousy! 
Weary 
record 
of 
a 
vain 
strife! 
Ideas 
are 
no 
man’s 
property. 
As 
well 
pretend 
to 
ownership 
of 
light, 
or 
set 
up 
a 
claim 
to 
private 
estate 
in 
the 
Holy 
Ghost. 
The 
Spirit 
blows 
where 
it 
lists. 
Truth 
inspires 
whom 
it 
finds. 
He 
who 
knows 
best 
to 
conspire 
with 
it 
has 
it. 
Both 
philosophers 
swerved 
from 
their 
native 
simplicity 
and 
nobleness 
of 
soul. 
Both 
sinned 
and 
were 
sinned 
against. 
Leibnitz 
did 
unhandsome 
things, 
but 
he 
was 
sorely 
tried. 
Hishearttoldhimthattheright 
ofthequarrelwason 
his 
side,andthegeneral 
stupidity 
would 
not 
see 
it. 
The 
general 
malice, 
rejoicing 
in 
aspersion 
of 
a 
noble 
name, 
would 
not 
see 
it. 
The 
Royal 
Society 
would 
not 
see 
it, 
— 
nor 
France, 
until 
long 
after 
Leibnitz’s 
death. 
Sir 
David 
Brewster’s 
account 
of 
the 
matter, 
according 
to 
the 
German 
authorities, 
Gerhardt, 
Guhrauer, 
and 
others, 
is 
one-sided, 
and 
sins 
by 
suppressio 
veri, 
ignoring 
important 
documents, 

particularly 
Leibnitz’s 
letter 
to 
Oldenburg, 
August 
27, 
1676. 
Gerhardt 
has 
published 
Leibnitz’s 
own 
history 
of 
the 
Calculus 
as 
a 
counter-statement.10 
But 
even 
from 
Brewster’s 
account, 
as 
we 
remember 
it, 
(we 
have 
it 
not 
by 
us 
at 
this 
writing.) 
there 
is 
no 
more 
reason 
to 
doubt 
that 
Leibnitz’s 
discovery 
was 
independent 
of 
Newton’s 
than 
that 
Newton’s 
was 
independent 
of 
Leibnitz’s. 
The 
two 
discoveries, 
in 
fact, 
are 
not 
identical; 
the 
end 
and 
application 
are 
the 
same, 
but 
origin 
and 
process 
differ, 
and 
the 
German 
method 
has 
long 
superseded 
the 
English. 
The 
question 
in 
debate 
has 
been 
settled 
by 
supreme 
authority. 
Leibnitz 
has 
been 
tried 
by 
his 
peers. 
Euler, 
Lagrange, 
Laplace, 
Poisson, 
and 
Biot 
have 
honorably 
acquitted 
him 
of 
plagiarism, 
and 
reinstated 
him 
in 
his 
rights 
as 
true 
discoverer 
of 
the 
DifferentialCalculus. 


The 
one 
distinguishing 
trait 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
genius, 
and 
the 
one 
preëminent 
fact 
in 
his 
history, 
was 
what 
Feuerbach 
calls 
his 
πολυπραγμοσύνη, 
which, 
being 
interpreted, 
means 
having 
a 
finger 
in 
every 
pie. 
We 
are 
used 
to 
consider 
him 
as 
a 
man 
of 
letters; 
but 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
his 
life 
was 
spent 
in 
labors 
of 
quite 
another 
kind. 
He 
was 
more 
actor 
than 
writer. 
He 
wrote 
only 
for 
occasions, 
at 
the 
instigation 
of 
others, 
or 
to 
meet 
some 
pressing 
demand 
of 
the 
time. 
Besides 
occupying 
himself 
with 
mechanical 
inventions, 
some 
of 
which 
(in 
particular, 
his 
improvement 
of 
Pascal’s 
Calculating 
Machine) 
were 
quite 
famous 
in 
their 
day, 
— 
besides 
his 
project 
of 
a 
universal 
language, 
and 
his 
labors 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
union 
of 
the 
churches, 
— 
besides 
undertaking 
the 
revision 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
German 
Empire, 
superintending 
the 
Hanoverian 
mines, 
experimenting 
in 
the 
culture 
of 
silk, 
directing 
the 
medical 
profession, 
laboring 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
popular 
education, 
establishing 
academies 
of 
science, 
superintending 
royal 
libraries, 
ransacking 
the 
archives 
of 
Germany 
and 
Italy 
to 
find 
documents 
for 
his 
historyof 
theHouseofBrunswick, 
a 
work 
of 
immense 
research,11 
— 
besides 
these, 
and 
a 
multitude 
of 
similar 
and 



dissimilar 
avocations, 
he 
was 
deep 
in 
politics, 
German 
and 
European, 
and 
was 
occupied 
all 
his 
life 
long 
with 
political 
negotiations. 
He 
was 
a 
courtier, 
he 
was 
a 
diplomat, 
was 
consulted 
on 
all 
difficult 
matters 
of 
international 
policy, 
was 
employed 
at 
Hanover, 
at 
Berlin, 
at 
Vienna, 
in 
the 
public 
and 
secret 
service 
of 
ducal, 
royal, 
and 
imperial 
governments, 
and 
charged 
with 
all 
sorts 
of 
delicate 
and 
difficult 
commissions, 
— 
matters 
of 
finance, 
of 
pacification, 
of 
treaty 
and 
appeal. 
He 
was 
Europe’s 
factotum. 
A 
complete 
biography 
of 
the 
man 
would 
be 
an 
epitome 
of 
the 
history 
of 
his 
time. 
The 
number 
and 
variety 
of 
his 
public 
engagements 
were 
such 
as 
would 
have 
crazed 
any 
ordinary 
brain. 
And 
to 
these 
were 
added 
private 
studies 
not 
less 
multifarious. 
“I 
am 
distracted 
beyond 
all 
account,” 
he 
writes 
to 
Vincent 
Placcius. 
“I 
am 
making 
extracts 
from 
archives, 
inspecting 
ancient 
documents, 
hunting 
up 
unpublished 
manuscripts; 
all 
this 
to 
illustrate 
the 
history 
of 
Brunswick. 
Letters 
in 
great 
number 
I 
receive 
and 
write. 
Then 
I 
have 
so 
many 
discoveries 
in 
mathematics, 
so 
many 
speculations 
in 
philosophy, 
so 
many 
other 
literary 
observations, 
which 
I 
am 
desirous 
of 
preserving, 
that 
I 
am 
often 
at 
a 
loss 
what 
to 
take 
hold 
of 
first, 
and 
can 
fairly 
sympathize 
in 
that 
saying 
of 
Ovid, 
‘Iamstraitened 
bymyabundance.’”12 


His 
diplomatic 
services 
are 
less 
known 
at 
present 
than 
his 
literary 
labors, 
but 
were 
not 
less 
esteemed 
in 
his 
own 
day. 
When 
Louis 
XIV. 
in 
1688, 
declared 
war 
against 
the 
German 
Empire, 
on 
the 
pretence 
that 
the 
Emperor 
was 
meditating 
an 
invasion 
of 
France, 
Leibnitz 
drew 
up 
the 
imperial 
manifesto, 
which 
repelled 
the 
charge 
and 
triumphantly 
exposed 
the 
hollowness 
of 
Louis’s 
cause. 
Another 
document, 
prepared 
by 
him 
at 
the 
solicitation, 
it 
is 
supposed, 
of 
several 
of 
the 
courts 
of 
Europe, 
advocating 
the 
claims 
of 
Charles 
of 
Austria 
to 
the 
vacant 
throne 
of 
Spain, 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
grandson 
of 
Louis, 
and 
setting 
forth 
the 
injurious 
consequences 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
French 
monarch, 
was 
hailed 
by 
his 
contemporaries 
as 
a 



masterpiece 
of 
historical 
learning 
and 
political 
wisdom. 
By 
his 
powerful 
advocacy 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Elector 
of 
Brandenburg 
he 
may 
be 
said 
to 
have 
aided 
the 
birth 
of 
the 
kingdom 
of 
Prussia, 
whose 
existence 
dates 
with 
the 
commencement 
of 
the 
last 
century. 
In 
the 
service 
of 
that 
kingdom 
he 
wrote 
and 
published 
important 
state-papers; 
among 
them, 
one 
relating 
to 
a 
point 
of 
contested 
right 
to 
which 
recent 
events 
have 
given 
fresh 
significance: 
“Traité: 
Sommaire 
du 
Droit 
de 
Frédéric 
I. 
Roi 
de 
Prusse 
à 
la 
Souveraineté 
de 
NeufchâteletdeVallenginenSuisse.” 


In 
Vienna, 
as 
at 
Berlin, 
the 
services 
of 
Leibnitz 
were 
subsidized 
by 
the 
State. 
By 
the 
Peace 
of 
Utrecht, 
the 
house 
of 
Habsburg 
had 
been 
defeated 
in 
its 
claims 
to 
the 
Spanish 
throne, 
and 
the 
foreign 
and 
internal 
affairs 
of 
the 
Austrian 
government 
were 
involved 
in 
many 
perplexities, 
which, 
it 
was 
hoped, 
the 
philosopher’s 
counsel 
might 
help 
to 
untangle. 
He 
was 
often 
present 
at 
the 
private 
meetings 
of 
the 
cabinet, 
and 
received 
from 
the 
Emperor 
the 
honorable 
distinction 
of 
Kaiserlicher 
Hofrath, 
in 
addition 
to 
that, 
which 
had 
previously 
been 
awarded 
to 
him, 
of 
Baron 
of 
the 
Empire. 
The 
highest 
post 
in 
the 
gift 
of 
government 
was 
open 
to 
him, 
on 
condition 
of 
renouncing 
his 
Protestant 
faith, 
which, 
notwithstanding 
his 
tolerant 
feeling 
toward 
the 
Roman 
Church, 
and 
the 
splendid 
compensations 
which 
awaited 
such 
a 
convertite,hecouldneverbeprevailedupontodo. 


A 
natural, 
but 
very 
remarkable 
consequence 
of 
this 
manifold 
activity 
and 
lifelong 
absorption 
in 
public 
affairs 
was 
the 
failure 
of 
so 
great 
a 
thinker 
to 
produce 
a 
single 
systematic 
and 
elaborate 
work 
containing 
a 
complete 
and 
detailed 
exposition 
of 
his 
philosophical, 
and 
especially 
his 
ontological 
views. 
For 
such 
an 
exposition 
Leibnitz 
could 
find 
at 
no 
period 
of 
his 
life 
the 
requisite 
time 
and 
scope. 
In 
the 
vast 
multitude 
of 
his 
productions 
there 
is 
no 
complete 
philosophic 
work. 
The 
most 
arduous 
of 
his 
literary 
labors 
are 
historical 
compilations, 
made 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
State. 
Such 
were 
the 



“History 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Brunswick,” 
already 
mentioned, 
the 
“Accessiones 
Historiæ,” 
the 
“Scriptores 
Rerum 
Brunsvicensium 
Illustrationi 
inservientes,” 
and 
the 
“Codex 
Juris 
Gentium 
Diplomaticus”; 
— 
works 
involving 
an 
incredible 
amount 
of 
labor 
and 
research, 
but 
adding 
little 
to 
his 
posthumous 
fame. 
His 
philosophical 
studies, 
after 
entering 
the 
Hanoverian 
service, 
which 
he 
did 
in 
his 
thirtieth 
year, 
were 
pursued, 
as 
he 
tells 
his 
correspondent 
Placcius, 
by 
stealth, 
— 
that 
is, 
at 
odd 
moments 
snatched 
from 
official 
duties 
and 
the 
cares 
of 
state. 
Accordingly, 
his 
metaphysical 
works 
have 
all 
a 
fragmentary 
character. 
Instead 
of 
systematic 
treatises, 
they 
are 
loose 
papers, 
contributions 
to 
journals 
and 
magazines, 
or 
sketches 
prepared 
for 
the 
use 
of 
friends. 
They 
are 
all 
occasional 
productions, 
elicited 
by 
some 
external 
cause, 
not 
prompted 
by 
inward 
necessity. 
The 
“Nouveaux 
Essais,” 
his 
most 
considerable 
work 
in 
that 
department, 
originated 
in 
comments 
on 
Locke, 
and 
was 
not 
published 
until 
after 
his 
death. 
The 
“Monadology” 
is 
a 
series 
of 
propositions 
drawn 
up 
for 
the 
use 
of 
Prince 
Eugene, 
and 
was 
never 
intended 
to 
be 
made 
public. 
And, 
probably, 
the 
“Théodicée” 
would 
never 
have 
seen 
the 
light 
except 
for 
his 
cultivated 
and 
loved 
pupil, 
the 
Queen 
of 
Prussia, 
for 
whose 
instructionitwasdesigned. 


It 
is 
a 
curious 
fact, 
and 
a 
good 
illustration 
of 
the 
state 
of 
letters 
in 
Germany 
at 
that 
time, 
that 
Leibnitz 
wrote 
so 
little 
— 
almost 
nothing 
of 
importance 
— 
in 
his 
native 
tongue. 
In 
Erdmann’s 
edition 
of 
his 
philosophical 
works 
there 
are 
only 
two 
short 
essays 
in 
German; 
the 
rest 
are 
all 
Latin 
or 
French. 
He 
had 
it 
in 
contemplation 
at 
one 
time 
to 
establish 
a 
philosophical 
journal 
in 
Berlin, 
but 
doubts, 
in 
his 
letter 
to 
M. 
La 
Croye 
on 
the 
subject, 
in 
what 
language 
it 
should 
be 
conducted: 
“Il 
y 
a 
quelque 
tems 
que 
j’ay 
pensé 
à 
un 
journal 
de 
Savans 
qu’on 
pourroit 
publier 
à 
Berlin, 
mais 
je 
suis 
un 
peu 
en 
doute 
sur 
la 
langue...... 
Mais 
soit 
qu’on 
prit 
le 
Latin 
ou 
le 
François,”13 
etc. 
It 
seems 
never 
to 
have 
occurred 
to 
him 
that 
such 
a 
journal 
might 
be 
published 



in 
German. 
That 
language 
was 
then, 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
after, 
regarded 
by 
educated 
Germansverymuch 
as 
the 
Russianisregarded 
at 
thepresent 
day, 
as 
the 
language 
of 
vulgar 
life, 
unsuited 
to 
learned 
or 
polite 
intercourse. 
Frederic 
the 
Great, 
a 
century 
later, 
thought 
as 
meanly 
of 
its 
adaptation 
to 
literary 
purposes 
as 
did 
the 
contemporaries 
of 
Leibnitz. 
When 
Gellert, 
at 
his 
request, 
repeated 
to 
him 
one 
of 
his 
fables, 
he 
expressed 
his 
surprise 
that 
anything 
so 
clever 
could 
be 
produced 
in 
German. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
in 
apology 
for 
this 
neglect 
of 
their 
native 
tongue, 
that 
the 
German 
scholars 
of 
that 
age 
would 
have 
had 
a 
very 
inadequate 
audience, 
had 
their 
communications 
been 
confined 
to 
that 
language. 
Leibnitz 
craved 
and 
deserved 
a 
wider 
sphere 
for 
his 
thoughts 
than 
the 
use 
of 
the 
German 
could 
give 
him. 
It 
ought, 
however, 
to 
be 
remembered 
to 
his 
credit, 
that, 
as 
language 
in 
general 
was 
one 
among 
the 
numberless 
topics 
he 
investigated, 
so 
the 
Germaninparticular 
engaged 
at 
one 
time 
his 
special 
attention. 
It 
was 
made 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
disquisition, 
which 
suggested 
to 
the 
Berlin 
Academy, 
in 
the 
next 
century, 
the 
method 
adopted 
by 
that 
body 
for 
the 
culture 
and 
improvement 
of 
the 
national 
speech. 
In 
this 
writing, 
as 
in 
all 
his 
German 
compositions, 
he 
manifested 
a 
complete 
command 
of 
the 
language, 
and 
imparted 
to 
it 
a 
purity 
and 
elegance 
of 
diction 
very 
uncommon 
in 
his 
day.

LEIBNITZ’SPHILOSOPHY. 


The 
interest 
to 
us 
in 
this 
extraordinary 
man 
— 
who 
died 
at 
Hanover, 
1716, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
his 
labors 
and 
projects 
— 
turns 
mainly 
on 
his 
speculative 
philosophy. 
It 
was 
only 
as 
an 
incidental 
pursuit 
that 
he 
occupied 
himself 
with 
metaphysic; 
yet 
no 
philosopher 
since 
Aristotle 
— 
with 
whom, 
though 
claiming 
to 
be 
more 
Platonic 
than 
Aristotelian, 
he 
has 
much 
in 
common 
— 
has 
furnished 
more 
luminous 
hints 
to 
the 
elucidation 
of 
metaphysical 



problems. 
The 
problems 
he 
attempted 
were 
which 
concern 
the 
most 
inscrutable, 
but, 
to 
the 
genuine 
metaphysician, 
most 
fascinating 
of 
all 
topics, 
the 
nature 
of 
substance, 
matter 
and 
spirit, 
absolute 
being, 
— 
in 
a 
word, 
Ontology. 
This 
department 
of 
metaphysic, 
the 
most 
interesting, 
and, 
agonistically,14 
the 
most 
important 
branch 
of 
that 
study, 
has 
been 
deliberately, 
purposely, 
and, 
with 
one 
or 
two 
exceptions, 
uniformly 
avoided 
by 
the 
English 
metaphysicians 
so-called, 
with 
Locke 
at 
their 
head, 
and 
equally 
by 
their 
Scottish 
successors, 
until 
the 
recent 
“Institutes” 
of 
the 
witty 
Professor 
of 
St. 
Andrew’s. 
Locke’s 
“Essay 
concerning 
the 
Human 
Understanding,” 
a 
century 
and 
a 
half 
ago, 
diverted 
the 
English 
mind 
from 
metaphysic 
proper 
into 
what 
is 
commonly 
called 
Psychology, 
but 
ought, 
of 
right, 
to 
be 
termed 
Noölogy, 
or 
“Philosophy 
of 
the 
Human 
Mind,” 
as 
Dugald 
Stewart 
entitled 
his 
treatise. 
This 
is 
the 
study 
which 
has 
usually 
taken 
the 
place 
of 
metaphysic 
at 
Cambridge 
and 
other 
colleges, 
— 
the 
science 
that 
professes 
to 
show 
“how 
ideas 
enter 
the 
mind”; 
which, 
considering 
the 
rareness 
of 
the 
occurrence 
with 
the 
mass 
of 
mankind, 
we 
cannot 
regard 
as 
a 
very 
practical 
inquiry. 
We 
well 
remember 
our 
disappointment, 
when, 
at 
the 
usual 
stage 
in 
the 
college 
curriculum, 
we 
were 
promised 
“metaphysics” 
and 
were 
set 
to 
grind 
in 
Stewart’s 
profitless 
mill, 
where 
so 
few 
problems 
of 
either 
practical 
or 
theoretical 
importance 
are 
brought 
to 
the 
hopper, 
and 
where, 
in 
fact, 
the 
object 
is 
rather 
to 
show 
how 
the 
upper 
mill-stone 
revolves 
upon 
the 
nether, 
(reflection 
upon 
sensation,) 
and 
how 
the 
grist 
is 
conveyed 
to 
the 
feeder, 
thantorealizeactualmetaphysicalflour. 


Locke’s 
reason 
for 
repudiating 
ontology 
is 
the 
alleged 
impossibility 
of 
arriving 
at 
truth 
in 
that 
pursuit,— 
“of 
finding 
satisfaction 
in 
a 
quiet 
and 
sure 
possession 
of 
truths 
that 
most 
concern 
us, 
whilst 
we 
let 
loose 
our 
thoughts 
into 
the 
vast 
ocean 
of 
being.”15 
Unfortunately, 
however, 
as 
Kant 
has 
shown, 
the 
results 
of 
noölogical 
inquiry 
are 
just 
as 
questionable 
as 
those 
of 
ontology, 



whilst 
the 
topics 
on 
which 
it 
is 
employed 
are 
of 
far 
inferior 
moment. 
If, 
as 
Locke 
intimates, 
we 
can 
know 
nothing 
of 
being 
without 
first 
analyzing 
the 
understanding, 
it 
is 
equally 
sure 
that 
we 
can 
know 
nothing 
of 
the 
understanding 
except 
in 
union 
with 
and 
in 
action 
on 
being. 
And 
excepting 
his 
own 
fundamental 
position 
concerning 
the 
sensuous 
origin 
of 
our 
ideas, 
— 
to 
which 
few, 
since 
Kant, 
will 
assent, 
— 
there 
is 
hardly 
a 
theorem, 
in 
all 
the 
writings 
of 
this 
school, 
of 
prime 
and 
vital 
significance. 
The 
school 
is 
tartly, 
but 
aptly, 
characterized 
by 
Professor 
Ferrier: 
“Would 
people 
inquire 
directly 
into 
the 
laws 
of 
thought 
and 
of 
knowledge 
by 
merely 
looking 
to 
knowledge 
or 
to 
thought 
itself, 
without 
attending 
to 
what 
is 
known 
or 
what 
is 
thought 
of? 
Psychology 
usually 
goes 
to 
work 
in 
this 
abstract 
fashion; 
but 
such 
a 
mode 
of 
procedure 
is 
hopeless, 
— 
as 
hopeless 
as 
the 
analogous 
instance 
by 
which 
the 
wits 
of 
old 
were 
wont 
to 
typify 
any 
particularly 
fruitless 
undertaking, 
— 
namely, 
the 
operation 
of 
milking 
a 
he-goat 
into 
a 
sieve. 
No 
milk 
comes, 
in 
the 
first 
place, 
and 
even 
that 
the 
sieve 
will 
not 
retain! 
There 
is 
a 
loss 
of 
nothing 
twice 
over. 
Like 
the 
man 
milking, 
the 
inquirer 
obtains 
no 
milk 
in 
the 
first 
place; 
and, 
in 
the 
second 
place, 
he 
loses 
it, 
like 
the 
man 
holding 
the 
sieve.... 
Our 
Scottish 
philosophy, 
in 
particular, 
has 
presented 
a 
spectacle 
of 
this 
description. 
Reid 
obtained 
no 
result, 
owing 
to 
the 
abstract 
nature 
of 
his 
inquiry, 
and 
the 
nothingness 
of 
his 
system 
has 
escaped 
through 
all 
the 
sieves 
ofhissuccessors.”16 


Leibnitz’s 
metaphysical 
speculations 
are 
scattered 
through 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
writings, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
letters 
to 
his 
contemporaries. 
These 
Professor 
Erdmann 
has 
incorporated 
in 
his 
edition 
of 
the 
Philosophical 
Works. 
Beside 
these 
we 
may 
mention, 
as 
particularly 
deserving 
of 
notice, 
the 
“Meditationes 
de 
Cognitione, 
Veritate 
et 
Ideis”, 
the 
“Systeme 
Nouveau 
de 
la 
Nature”, 
“De 
Primæ 
Philosophiæ 
Emendatione 
et 
de 
Notione 
Substantiæ”, 
“Reflexions 
sur 
l’Essai 
de 
l’Entendement 
humain”, 
“De 
Rerum 
Originatione 
Radicali”, 
“De 



ipsa 
Natura”, 
“Considerations 
sur 
la 
Doctrine 
d’un 
Esprit 
universel”, 
“Nouveaux 
Essais 
sur 
l’Entendement 
humain”, 
“Considerations 
sur 
le 
Principe 
de 
Vie”. 
To 
these 
we 
must 
add 
the 
“Théodicée” 
(though 
more 
theological 
than 
metaphysical) 
and 
the 
“Monadologie”, 
the 
most 
compact 
philosophical 
treatise 
of 
modern 
time. 
It 
is 
worthy 
of 
note, 
that, 
writing 
in 
the 
desultory, 
fragmentary, 
and 
accidental 
way 
he 
did, 
he 
not 
only 
wrote 
with 
unexampled 
clearness 
on 
matters 
the 
most 
abstruse, 
but 
never, 
that 
we 
are 
aware, 
in 
all 
the 
variety 
of 
his 
communications, 
extending 
over 
so 
many 
years, 
contradicted 
himself. 
No 
philosopher 
is 
more 
intelligible, 
none 
more 
consequent. 


In 
philosophy, 
Leibnitz 
was 
a 
Realist. 
We 
use 
that 
term 
in 
the 
modern, 
not 
in 
the 
scholastic 
sense. 
In 
the 
scholastic 
sense, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
he 
was 
not 
a 
Realist, 
but, 
from 
childhood 
up, 
a 
Nominalist. 
But 
the 
Realism 
of 
the 
schools 
hasless 
affinitywith 
the 
Realismthan 
withtheIdealismof 
the 
present 
day. 


His 
opinions 
must 
be 
studied 
in 
connection 
with 
those 
of 
his 
contemporaries. 


Des 
Cartes, 
Spinoza, 
Locke, 
and 
Leibnitz, 
the 
four 
most 
distinguished 
philosophers 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
represent 
four 
widely 
different 
and 
cardinal 
tendencies 
in 
philosophy: 
Dualism, 
Idealism, 
Sensualism, 
and 
Realism. 


Des 
Cartes 
perceived 
the 
incompatibility 
of 
the 
two 
primary 
qualities 
of 
being, 
thought 
and 
extension, 
as 
attributes 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
(created) 
substance. 
He 
therefore 
postulated 
two 
(created) 
substances, 
— 
one 
characterized 
by 
thought 
without 
extension, 
the 
other 
by 
extension 
without 
thought. 
These 
two 
aresoalien 
and 
so 
incongruous, 
that 
neither 
can 
influence 
the 
other, 
or 
determine 
the 
other, 
or 
any 
way 
relate 
with 
the 
other, 
except 
by 
direct 
mediation 
of 
Deity. 
(The 
doctrine 
of 
Occasional 
Causes.) 
This 
is 
Dualism, 
— 
that 
sharp 
and 
rigorous 
antithesis 
of 
mind 
and 
matter, 
which 
Des 



Cartes, 
if 
he 
did 
not 
originate 
it, 
was 
the 
first 
to 
develop 
into 
philosophic 
significance, 
and 
which 
ever 
since 
has 
been 
the 
prevailing 
ontology 
of 
the 
Western 
world. 
So 
deeply 
has 
the 
thought 
of 
that 
master 
mind 
inwrought 
itselfinto 
thevery 
consciousnessofhumanity! 


Spinoza 
saw, 
that, 
if 
God 
alone 
can 
bring 
mind 
and 
matter 
together 
and 
effect 
a 
relation 
between 
them, 
it 
follows 
that 
mind 
and 
matter, 
or 
their 
attributes, 
however 
contrary, 
do 
meet 
in 
Deity; 
and 
if 
so, 
what 
need 
of 
three 
distinct 
natures? 
What 
need 
of 
two 
substances 
beside 
God, 
as 
subjects 
of 
these 
attributes? 
Retain 
the 
middle 
term 
and 
drop 
the 
extremes 
and 
you 
have 
the 
Spinozan 
doctrine 
of 
one 
(uncreated) 
substance, 
combining 
the 
attributes 
of 
thought 
and 
extension. 
This 
is 
Pantheism, 
or 
objective 
idealism, 
as 
distinguished 
from 
the 
subjective 
idealism 
of 
Fichte. 
Strange, 
that 
the 
stigma 
of 
atheism 
should 
have 
been 
affixed 
to 
a 
system 
whose 
very 
starting-point 
is 
Deity 
and 
whose 
great 
characteristic 
is 
the 
ignoration 
of 
everything 
but 
Deity, 
insomuch 
that 
the 
pure 
and 
devout 
Novalis 
pronounced 
the 
author 
a 
God-drunken 
man,andSpinozisma 
surfeitofDeity.17 


Naturally 
enough, 
the 
charge 
of 
atheism 
comes 
from 
the 
unbelieving 
Bayle, 
whose 
omnivorous 
mind, 
like 
the 
anaconda, 
assisted 
its 
enormous 
deglutition 
with 
a 
poisonous 
saliva 
of 
its 
own, 
and 
whose 
negative 
temper 
makesthe 
“Dictionnaire 
Historique” 
more 
Morgue 
than 
Valhalla. 


Locke, 
who 
combined 
in 
a 
strange 
union 
strong 
religious 
faith 
with 
philosophic 
unbelief, 
turned 
aside, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
from 
the 
questions 
which 
had 
occupied 
his 
predecessors; 
knew 
little 
and 
cared 
less 
about 
substance 
and 
accident, 
matter 
and 
spirit; 
but 
set 
himself 
to 
investigate 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
organ 
itself 
by 
which 
truth 
is 
apprehended. 
In 
this 
investigation 
he 
began 
by 
emptying 
the 
mind 
of 
all 
native 
elements 
of 
knowledge. 
He 
repudiated 
any 
supposed 
dowry 
of 
original 
truths 
or 
innate 
or 
connate 
ideas, 
and 
endeavored 
to 
show 
how, 
by 
acting 
on 
the 
report 
of 
the 
senses 
and 
personal 
experience, 



the 
understanding 
arrives 
at 
all 
the 
ideas 
of 
which 
it 
is 
conscious. 
The 
mode 
of 
procedure 
in 
thiscase 
is 
empiricism; 
the 
resultwithLockewassensualism, 


— 
more 
fully 
developed 
by 
Condillac,18 
in 
the 
next 
century. 
But 
the 
same 
method 
may 
lead, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Berkeley, 
to 
immaterialism, 
falsely 
called 
idealism. 
Or 
it 
may 
lead, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Helveticus, 
to 
materialism. 
Locke 
himself 
would 
probably 
have 
landed 
in 
materialism, 
had 
he 
followed 
freely 
the 
bent 
of 
his 
own 
thought, 
without 
the 
restraints 
of 
a 
cautious 
temper, 
and 
respect 
for 
the 
common 
and 
traditional 
opinion 
of 
his 
time. 
The 
“Essay” 
discovers 
an 
unmistakable 
leaning 
in 
that 
direction; 
as 
where 
the 
author 
supposes, 
“We 
shall 
never 
be 
able 
to 
know 
whether 
any 
mere 
material 
being 
thinks 
or 
no; 
it 
being 
impossible 
for 
us, 
by 
the 
contemplation 
of 
our 
own 
ideas, 
without 
revelation, 
to 
discover 
whether 
Omnipotency 
has 
not 
given 
to 
some 
systems 
of 
matter 
fitly 
disposed 
a 
power 
to 
perceive 
and 
think;..... 
it 
being, 
in 
respect 
of 
our 
notions, 
not 
much 
more 
remote 
from 
our 
comprehension 
to 
conceive 
that 
God 
can, 
if 
he 
pleases, 
superadd 
to 
matter 
a 
faculty 
of 
thinking, 
than 
that 
he 
should 
superadd 
to 
it 
another 
substance 
with 
a 
faculty 
of 
thinking, 
since 
we 
know 
not 
wherein 
thinking 
consists, 
nor 
to 
what 
sort 
of 
substances 
the 
Almighty 
has 
been 
pleased 
to 
give 
that 
power, 
which 
cannot 
be 
in 
any 
created 
being 
but 
merely 
by 
the 
good 
pleasure 
and 
bounty 
of 
the 
Creator. 
For 
I 
see 
no 
contradiction 
in 
it, 
that 
the 
first 
thinking 
eternal 
Being 
should, 
if 
he 
pleased, 
give 
to 
certain 
systems 
of 
created, 
senseless 
matter, 
put 
together 
as 
he 
thinks 
fit, 
some 
degrees 
of 
sense, 
perception, 
and 
thought.”19 
With 
such 
notions 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
thought, 
as 
a 
kind 
of 
mechanical 
contrivance, 
that 
can 
be 
conferred 
outright 
by 
an 
arbitrary 
act 
of 
Deity, 
and 
attached 
to 
one 
nature 
as 
well 
as 
another, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
Locke 
could 
have 
had 
no 
idea 
of 
spirit 
as 
conceived 
by 
metaphysicians, 
— 
or 
no 
belief 
in 
that 
idea, 
if 
conceived. 
And 
with 
such 
conceptions 
of 
Deity 
and 
Divine 
operations, 
as 
consisting 
in 
absolute 
power 
dissociated 
from 
absolute 

reason, 
one 
would 
not 
be 
surprised 
to 
find 
him 
asserting, 
that 
God, 
if 
he 
pleased, 
might 
make 
two 
and 
two 
to 
be 
one, 
instead 
of 
four, 
— 
that 
mathematical 
lawsare 
arbitrary 
determinations 
of 
theSupremeWill, 
— 
thata 
thing 
is 
true 
only 
as 
God 
wills 
it 
to 
be 
so, 
— 
in 
fine, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
absolute 
truth. 
The 
resort 
to 
“Omnipotency” 
in 
such 
matters 
is 
more 
convenient 
than 
philosophical; 
it 
is 
a 
dodging 
of 
the 
question, 
instead 
of 
an 
attempt 
to 
solve 
it. 
Divine 
ordination—”Διδς 
δ’ 
έτελείετο 
βουλή” 
— 
is 
a 
maxim 
which 
settles 
all 
difficulties. 
But 
it 
also 
precludes 
all 
inquiry. 
Why 
speculateatall,withthisuniversalsolventat 
hand? 


The 
“contradiction” 
which 
Locke 
could 
not 
see 
was 
clearly 
seen 
and 
keenly 
felt 
by 
Leibnitz. 
The 
arbitrary 
will 
of 
God, 
to 
him, 
was 
no 
solution. 
He 
believed 
in 
necessary 
truths 
independent 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Will; 
in 
other 
words, 
he 
believed 
that 
the 
Supreme 
Will 
is 
but 
the 
organ 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Reason: 
“Il 
ne 
faut 
point 
s’imaginer, 
que 
les 
vérités 
éternelles, 
étant 
dépendantes 
de 
Dieu, 
sont 
arbitragés 
et 
dépendent 
de 
sa 
volonté.” 
He 
felt, 
with 
Des 
Cartes, 
the 
incompatibility 
of 
thought 
with 
extension, 
considered 
as 
an 
immanent 
quality 
of 
substance, 
and 
he 
shared 
with 
Spinoza 
the 
unific 
propensity 
which 
distinguishes 
the 
higher 
order 
of 
philosophic 
minds. 
Dualism 
was 
an 
offence 
to 
him. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
differed 
from 
Spinoza 
in 
his 
vivid 
sense 
of 
individuality, 
of 
personality. 
The 
pantheistic 
idea 
of 
a 
single,solebeing, 
of 
which 
allother 
beings 
aremere 
modalities, 
was 
also 
and 
equally 
an 
offence 
to 
him. 
He 
saw 
well 
the 
illusoriness 
and 
unfruitfulness 
of 
such 
a 
universe 
as 
Spinoza 
dreamed. 
He 
saw 
it 
to 
be 
a 
vain 
imagination, 
a 
dream-world, 
“without 
form 
and 
void,” 
nowhere 
blossoming 
into 
reality. 
The 
philosophy 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
equally 
remote 
from 
that 
of 
Des 
Cartes 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
from 
that 
of 
Spinoza 
on 
the 
other. 
He 
diverges 
from 
the 
former 
on 
the 
question 
of 
substance, 
which 
Des 
Cartes 
conceived 
as 
consisting 
of 
two 
kinds, 
one 
active 
(thinking) 
and 
one 
passive 
(extended), 
but 
which 
Leibnitz 



conceives 
to 
be 
all 
and 
only 
active. 
He 
explodes 
Dualism, 
and 
resolves 
the 
antithesis 
of 
matter 
and 
spirit 
by 
positing 
extension 
as 
a 
continuous 
act 
instead 
of 
a 
passive 
mode, 
substance 
as 
an 
active 
force 
instead 
of 
an 
inert 
mass, 
— 
matter 
as 
substance 
appearing, 
communicating, 
— 
as 
the 
necessary 
bandandrelation 
ofspirits 
amongthemselves.20 


He 
parts 
company 
with 
Spinoza 
on 
the 
question 
of 
individuality. 
Substance 
is 
homogeneous; 
but 
substances, 
or 
beings, 
are 
infinite. 
Spinoza 
looked 
upon 
the 
universe 
and 
saw 
in 
it 
the 
undivided 
background 
on 
which 
the 
objects 
of 
human 
consciousness 
are 
painted 
as 
momentary 
pictures. 
Leibnitz 
looked 
and 
saw 
that 
background, 
like 
the 
background 
of 
one 
of 
Raphael’s 
Madonnas, 
instinct 
with 
individual 
life, 
and 
swarming 
with 
intelligences 
which 
look 
out 
from 
every 
point 
of 
space. 
Leibnitz’s 
universe 
is 
composed 
of 
Monads, 
that 
is, 
units, 
individual 
substances, 
or 
entities, 
having 
neither 
extension, 
parts, 
nor 
figure, 
and, 
of 
course, 
indivisible. 
These 
are 
“the 
veritableatomsofnature,theelementsof 
things.” 


The 
Monad 
is 
unformed 
and 
imperishable; 
it 
has 
no 
natural 
end 
or 
beginning. 
It 
could 
begin 
to 
be 
only 
by 
creation; 
it 
can 
cease 
to 
be 
only 
by 
annihilation. 
It 
cannot 
be 
affected 
from 
without 
or 
changed 
in 
its 
interior 
by 
any 
other 
creature. 
Still, 
it 
must 
have 
qualities, 
without 
which 
it 
would 
not 
be 
an 
entity. 
And 
monads 
must 
differ 
one 
from 
another, 
or 
there 
would 
be 
no 
changes 
in 
our 
experience; 
since 
all 
that 
takes 
place 
in 
compound 
bodies 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
simpleswhich 
compose 
them. 
Moreover, 
the 
monad, 
though 
uninfluenced 
from 
without, 
is 
changing 
continually; 
the 
change 
proceeds 
fromaninternalprinciple. 
Everymonad 
issubjecttoamultitude 
ofaffections 
and 
relations, 
although 
without 
parts. 
This 
shifting 
state, 
which 
represents 
multitude 
in 
unity, 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
what 
we 
call 
Perception, 
which 
must 
be 
carefully 
distinguished 
from 
Apperception, 
or 
consciousness. 
And 
the 
action 
of 
the 
internal 
principle 
which 
causes 
change 
in 
the 
monad, 
or 
a 



passing 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another, 
is 
Appetition. 
The 
desire 
does 
not 
always 
attain 
to 
the 
perception 
to 
which 
it 
tends, 
but 
it 
always 
effects 
something,andcausesachangeofperceptions. 


Leibnitz 
differs 
from 
Locke 
in 
maintaining 
that 
perception 
is 
inexplicable 
and 
inconceivable 
on 
mechanical 
principles. 
It 
is 
always 
the 
act 
of 
a 
simple 
substance, 
never 
of 
a 
compound. 
And 
“in 
simple 
substances 
there 
is 
nothing 
butperceptionsandtheirchanges.”21 


He 
differs 
from 
Locke, 
furthermore, 
on 
the 
question 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
ideas. 
This 
question, 
he 
says, 
“is 
not 
a 
preliminary 
one 
in 
philosophy, 
and 
one 
must 
have 
made 
great 
progress 
to 
be 
able 
to 
grapple 
successfully 
with 
it.”— 
“Meanwhile, 
I 
think 
I 
may 
say, 
that 
our 
ideas, 
even 
those 
of 
sensible 
objects, 
viennent 
de 
nôtre 
propre 
fond...... 
I 
am 
by 
no 
means 
for 
the 
tabula 
rasa 
of 
Aristotle;onthecontrary,thereistomesomething 
rational(quelque 
chose 
de 
solide) 
in 
what 
Plato 
called 
reminiscence. 
Nay, 
more 
than 
that, 
we 
have 
not 
only 
a 
reminiscence 
of 
all 
our 
past 
thoughts, 
but 
we 
have 
also 
a 
presentiment 
ofallourthoughts.”22 


Mr. 
Lewes, 
in 
his 
“Biographical 
History 
of 
Philosophy,” 
speaks 
of 
the 
essay 
from 
which 
these 
words 
are 
quoted, 
as 
written 
in 
“a 
somewhat 
supercilious 
tone.” 
We 
are 
unable 
to 
detect 
any 
such 
feature 
in 
it. 
That 
trait 
was 
wholly 
foreign 
from 
Leibnitz’s 
nature. 
“Car 
je 
suis 
des 
plus 
dociles,” 
he 
says 
of 
himself, 
in 
this 
same 
essay. 
He 
was 
the 
most 
tolerant 
of 
philosophers. 
“Je 
ne 
méprise 
presque 
rien.”— 
“Nemo 
est 
ingenio 
minus 
quam 
ego 
censorio.”— 
“Mirum 
dictu: 
probo 
pleraque 
quae 
lego.”— 
“Non 
admodum 
refutationesquaerereautlegere 
soleo.” 


To 
return 
to 
the 
monads. 
Each 
monad, 
according 
to 
Leibnitz, 
is, 
properly 
speaking, 
a 
soul, 
inasmuch 
as 
each 
is 
endowed 
with 
perception. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
distinguish 
those 
which 
have 
only 
perception 
from 
those 
which 
have 
also 



sentiment 
and 
memory, 
he 
will 
call 
the 
latter 
souls, 
the 
former 
monads 
or 
entelechies.23 


The 
naked 
monad, 
he 
says, 
has 
perceptions 
without 
relief, 
or 
“enhanced 
flavor”; 
it 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
stupor. 
Death, 
he 
thinks, 
may 
produce 
this 
state 
for 
a 
time 
in 
animals. 
The 
monads 
completely 
fill 
the 
world; 
there 
is 
never 
and 
nowhere 
a 
void, 
and 
never 
complete 
inanimateness 
and 
inertness. 
The 
universe 
is 
a 
plenum 
of 
souls. 
Wherever 
we 
behold 
an 
organic 
whole, 
(unum 
per 
se,) 
there 
monads 
are 
grouped 
around 
a 
central 
monad 
to 
which 
they 
are 
subordinate, 
and 
which 
they 
are 
constrained 
to 
serve 
so 
long 
as 
that 
connection 
lasts. 
Masses 
of 
inorganic 
matter 
are 
aggregations 
of 
monads 
without 
a 
regent, 
or 
sentient 
soul 
(unum 
per 
accidens). 
There 
can 
be 
no 
monad 
without 
matter, 
that 
is, 
without 
society, 
and 
no 
soul 
without 
a 
body. 
Not 
only 
the 
human 
soul 
is 
indestructible 
and 
immortal, 
but 
also 
the 
animal 
soul. 
There 
is 
no 
generation 
out 
of 
nothing, 
and 
no 
absolute 
death. 
Birth 
is 
expansion, 
development, 
growth; 
and 
death 
is 
contraction, 
envelopment, 
decrease. 
The 
monads 
which 
are 
destined 
to 
become 
human 
souls 
have 
existed 
from 
the 
beginning 
in 
organic 
matter, 
but 
only 
as 
sentient 
or 
animal 
souls, 
without 
reason. 
They 
remain 
in 
this 
condition 
until 
the 
generation 
of 
the 
human 
beings 
to 
which 
they 
belong, 
and 
then 
develope 
themselves 
into 
rational 
souls. 
The 
different 
organs 
and 
members 
of 
the 
body 
are 
also 
relatively 
souls 
which 
collect 
around 
them 
a 
number 
of 
monads 
for 
a 
specific 
purpose, 
and 
so 
on 
ad 
infinitum. 
Matter 
is 
not 
only 
infinitely 
divisible, 
but 
infinitely 
divided. 
All 
matter 
(so 
called) 
is 
living 
and 
active. 
“Every 
particle 
of 
matter 
may 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
garden 
of 
plants, 
or 
as 
a 
pond 
full 
of 
fishes. 
But 
each 
branch 
of 
each 
plant, 
each 
member 
of 
each 
animal, 
each 
drop 
of 
theirhumors, 
isin 
turnanothersuchgarden 
orpond.”24 


The 
connection 
between 
monads, 
consequently 
the 
connection 
between 
soul 
and 
body, 
is 
not 
composition, 
but 
an 
organic 
relation, 
— 
in 
some 
sort, 
a 



spontaneous 
relation. 
The 
soul 
forms 
its 
own 
body, 
and 
moulds 
it 
to 
its 
purpose. 
This 
hypothesis 
was 
afterward 
embraced 
and 
developed 
as 
a 
physiological 
principle 
by 
Stahl. 
As 
all 
the 
atoms 
in 
one 
body 
are 
organically 
related, 
so 
all 
the 
beings 
in 
the 
universe 
are 
organically 
related 
to 
each 
other 
and 
to 
the 
All. 
One 
creature, 
or 
one 
organ 
of 
a 
creature, 
being 
given, 
there 
is 
given 
with 
it 
the 
world’s 
history 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end. 
All 
bodies 
are 
strictly 
fluid; 
the 
universe 
is 
in 
flux. 


The 
principle 
of 
continuity 
answers 
the 
same 
purpose 
in 
Leibnitz’s 
system 
that 
the 
single 
substance 
does 
in 
Spinoza’s. 
It 
vindicates 
the 
essential 
unity 
of 
all 
being. 
Yet 
the 
two 
conceptions 
are 
immeasurably 
different, 
and 
constitute 
an 
immeasurable 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
systems, 
considered 
in 
their 
practical 
and 
moral 
bearings, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
ontological 
aspects. 
Spinoza25 
starts 
with 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
Infinite, 
or 
the 
All-One, 
from 
which 
there 
is 
no 
logical 
deduction 
of 
the 
individual. 
And 
in 
Spinoza’s 
system 
the 
individual 
does 
not 
exist 
except 
as 
a 
modality. 
But 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
individual 
is 
one 
of 
the 
primordial 
truths 
of 
the 
human 
mind, 
the 
foremost 
fact 
of 
consciousness. 
With 
this, 
therefore, 
Leibnitz 
begins, 
and 
arrives, 
by 
logical 
induction, 
to 
the 
Absolute 
and 
Supreme. 
Spinoza 
ends 
where 
he 
begins, 
in 
pantheism; 
the 
moral 
result 
of 
his 
system, 
Godward, 
is 
fatalism, 
— 
manward, 
indifferentism 
and 
negation 
of 
moral 
good 
and 
evil. 
Leibnitz 
ends 
in 
theism; 
the 
moral 
result 
of 
his 
system, 
Godward, 
is 
optimism, 
— 
manward, 
liberty, 
personal 
responsibility,moralobligation. 


Hedemonstratesthebeingof 
Godbythenecessityofa 
sufficient 
reasonto 
account 
for 
the 
series 
of 
things. 
Each 
finite 
thing 
requires 
an 
antecedent 
or 
contingent 
cause. 
But 
the 
supposition 
of 
an 
endless 
sequence 
of 
contingent 
causes, 
or 
finite 
things, 
is 
absurd; 
the 
series 
must 
have 
had 
a 
beginning, 
and 
that 
beginning 
cannot 
have 
been 
a 
contingent 
cause 
or 
finite 
thing. 
“The 
final 
reason 
of 
things 
must 
be 
found 
in 
a 
necessary 
substance 
in 
which 
the 
detail 
of 



changes 
exists 
eminently, 
(ne 
soit 
qu’éminemment,) 
as 
in 
its 
source; 
and 
this 
is 
what 
we 
call 
God.”26 
The 
idea 
of 
God 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature, 
that 
the 
being 
corresponding 
to 
it, 
if 
possible, 
must 
be 
actual. 
We 
have 
the 
idea; 
it 
involves 
no 
bounds, 
no 
negation, 
consequently 
no 
contradiction. 
It 
is 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
possible,thereforeof 
anactual. 


“God 
is 
the 
primitive 
Unity, 
or 
the 
simple 
original 
Substance 
of 
which 
all 
the 
creatures, 
or 
original 
monads, 
are 
the 
products, 
and 
are 
generated, 
so 
to 
speak, 
by 
continual 
fulgurations 
from 
moment 
to 
moment, 
bounded 
by 
the 
receptivity 
of 
the 
creature, 
of 
whose 
existence 
limitation 
is 
an 
essential 
condition.”27 


The 
philosophic 
theologian 
and 
the 
Christianizing 
philosopher 
will 
rejoice 
to 
find 
in 
this 
proposition 
a 
point 
of 
reconciliation 
between 
the 
extramundane 
God 
of 
pure 
theism 
and 
the 
cardinal 
principle 
of 
Spinozism, 
the 
immanence 
of 
Deity 
in 
creation, 
— 
a 
principle 
as 
dear 
to 
the 
philosophic 
mind 
as 
that 
of 
the 
extramundane 
Divinity 
is 
to 
the 
theologian. 
The 
universe 
of 
Spinoza 
is 
a 
self-existent 
unit, 
divine 
in 
itself, 
but 
with 
no 
Divinity 
behind 
it. 
That 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
an 
endless 
series 
of 
units 
from 
a 
self-existent 
and 
divine 
source.

Thedoctrineofthe 
Preëstablished 
Harmony, 
so 
intimately 
and 
universally 
associated 
with 
the 
name 
of 
Leibnitz, 
has 
found 
little 
favor 
with 
his 
critics, 
or 
even 
with 
his 
admirers. 
Feuerbach 
calls 
it 
his 
weak 
side, 
and 
thinks 
that 
Leibnitz’s 
philosophy, 
else 
so 
profound, 
was 
here, 
as 
in 
other 
instances, 
overshadowed 
by 
the 
popular 
creed; 
that 
he 
accommodated 
himself 
to 
theology, 
as 
a 
highly 
cultivated 
and 
intelligent 
man, 
conscious 
of 
his 
superiority, 
accommodates 
himself 
to 
a 
lady 
in 
his 
conversation 
with 
her, 
translating 
his 
ideas 
into 
her 
language, 
and 
even 
paraphrasing 
them.

The 
author 
of 
the 
“Théodicée” 
was 
not 
more 
interested 
in 
philosophy 
than 
he 
was 
in 
theology. 
His 
thoughts 
and 
his 
purpose 
did 
equal 
justice 
to 
both. 
The 
deepest 
wish 
of 
his 
heart 
was 
to 
reconcile 
them, 
not 
by 
formal 
treaty, 
but 
in 
loving 
and 
condign 
union. 
We 
do 
not, 
however, 
object 
to 
an 
esoteric 
and 
exoteric 
view 
of 
the 
doctrine 
in 
question; 
and 
we 
quite 
agree 
with 
Feuerbach 
that 
thephrase 
préétablie 
does 
not 
express 
a 
metaphysical 
determination. 
It 
is 
one 
thing 
to 
say, 
that 
God, 
by 
an 
arbitrary 
decree 
from 
everlasting, 
has 
so 
predisposed 
and 
predetermined 
every 
motion 
in 
the 
world 
of 
matter 
that 
each 
volition 
of 
a 
rational 
agent 
finds 
in 
the 
constant 
procession 
of 
physical 
forces 
a 
concurrent 
event 
by 
which 
it 
is 
executed, 
but 
which 
would 
have 
taken 
place 
without 
his 
volition, 
just 
as 
the 
mail-coach 
takes 
our 
letter, 
if 
we 
have 
one, 
but 
goes 
all 
the 
same, 
when 
we 
do 
not 
write, 
— 
this 
is 
the 
gross, 
exoteric 
view, 
—and 
a 
verydifferentthing 
it 
is 
tosay, 
that 
themonads 
composing 
the 
human 
system 
and 
the 
universe 
of 
things 
are 
so 
related, 
adjusted, 
accommodated 
to 
each 
other, 
and 
to 
the 
whole, 
each 
being 
a 
representative 
of 
all 
the 
rest 
and 
a 
mirror 
of 
the 
universe, 
that 
each 
feels 
all 
that 
passes 
in 
the 
rest, 
and 
all 
conspire 
in 
every 
act,29 
more 
or 
less 
effectively, 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
their 
nearness 
to 
the 
prime 
agent. 
This 
is 
Leibnitz’s 
idea 
of 
preëstablished 
harmony, 
which, 
perhaps, 
would 
be 
better 
expressed 
by 
the 
term 
“necessary 
consent.” 
“In 
the 
ideas 
of 
God, 
each 
monad 
has 
a 
right 
to 
demand 
that 
God, 
in 
regulating 
the 
rest 
from 
the 
commencement 
of 
things, 
shall 
have 
regard 
to 
it; 
for 
since 
a 
created 
monad 
can 
have 
no 
physical 
influence 
on 
the 
interior 
of 
another, 
it 
is 
only 
by 
this 
means 
that 
one 
can 
be 
dependent 
on 
another.”— 
“The 
soul 
follows 
its 
own 
laws 
and 
the 
body 
follows 
its 
own, 
and 
they 
meet 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
preëstablished 
harmony 
which 
exists 
between 
all 
substances, 
as 
representatives 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
universe. 
Souls 
act 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
final 
causes 
by 
appetitions, 
etc. 
Bodies 
act 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
efficient 
causes 
or 
the 
laws 
of 
motion. 
And 
the 
two 
kingdoms, 
that 
of 



efficientcausesand 
thatoffinal 
causes,harmonizewitheachother.”30 


The 
Preëstablished 
Harmony, 
then, 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
philosophic 
statement 
of 
a 
fact, 
and 
not 
as 
a 
theory 
concerning 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
fact. 
But, 
like 
all 
philosophic 
and 
adequate 
statements, 
it 
answers 
the 
purpose 
of 
a 
theory, 
and 
clears 
up 
many 
difficulties. 
It 
is 
the 
best 
solution 
we 
know 
of 
the 
old 
contradiction 
of 
free-will 
and 
fate, 
— 
individual 
liberty 
and 
a 
necessary 
world. 
This 
antithesis 
disappears 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Leibnitian 
philosophy, 
which 
resolves 
freedom 
and 
necessity 
into 
different 
points 
of 
view 
and 
different 
stages 
of 
development. 
The 
principle 
of 
the 
Preëstablished 
Harmony 
was 
designed 
by 
Leibnitz 
to 
meet 
the 
difficulty, 
started 
by 
Des 
Cartes, 
of 
explaining 
the 
conformity 
between 
the 
perceptions 
of 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
corresponding 
affections 
of 
the 
body, 
since 
mind 
and 
matter, 
in 
his 
view, 
could 
have 
no 
connection 
with, 
or 
influence 
on 
each 
other. 
The 
Cartesians 
explained 
this 
correspondence 
by 
the 
theory 
of 
occasional 
causes, 
that 
is, 
by 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
Deity, 
who 
was 
supposed 
by 
his 
arbitrary 
will 
to 
have 
decreed 
a 
certain 
perception 
or 
sensation 
in 
the 
mind 
to 
go 
with 
a 
certain 
affection 
of 
the 
body, 
with 
which, 
however, 
it 
had 
no 
real 
connection. 
“Car 
il” 
(that 
is, 
M. 
Bayle) 
“est 
persuadé 
avec 
les 
Cartésiens 
modernes, 
que 
les 
idées 
des 
qualités 
sensibles 
que 
Dieu 
donne, 
selon 
eux, 
à 
l’âme, 
à 
l’occasion 
des 
mouvemens 
du 
corps, 
n’ont 
rien 
qui 
représente 
ces 
mouvemens, 
ou 
qui 
leur 
ressemble; 
de 
sorte 
qu’il 
étoit 
purement 
arbitraire 
que 
Dieu 
nous 
donnât 
les 
idées 
de 
la 
chaleur, 
du 
froid, 
de 
la 
lumière 
et 
autres 
que 
nous 
expérimentons, 
ou 
qu’il 
nous 
en 
donnât 
de 
tout-autres 
à 
cette 
même 
occasion.”31 


If 
the 
body 
was 
exposed 
to 
the 
flame, 
there 
was 
no 
more 
reason, 
according 
to 
this 
theory, 
why 
the 
soul 
should 
be 
conscious 
of 
pain 
than 
of 
pleasure, 
except 
that 
God 
had 
so 
ordained. 
Such 
a 
supposition 
was 
shocking 
to 
our 
philosopher, 
who 
could 
tolerate 
no 
arbitrariness 
in 
God 
and 
no 
gap 
or 



discrepancy 
in 
nature, 
and 
who, 
therefore, 
sought 
to 
explain, 
by 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
soul 
itself 
and 
its 
kindred 
monads, 
the 
correspondence 
for 
which 
so 
violentanhypothesiswasembraced 
bytheCartesians. 


We 
have 
left 
ourselves 
no 
room 
to 
speak 
as 
we 
would 
of 
Leibnitz 
as 
theosopher. 
It 
was 
in 
this 
character 
that 
he 
obtained, 
in 
the 
last 
century, 
his 
widest 
fame. 
The 
work 
by 
which 
he 
is 
most 
commonly 
known, 
by 
which 
alone 
he 
is 
known 
to 
many, 
is 
the 
“Théodicée,” 
— 
an 
attempt 
to 
vindicate 
the 
goodness 
of 
God 
against 
the 
cavils 
of 
unbelievers. 
He 
was 
one 
of 
the 
first 
to 
apply 
to 
this 
end 
the 
cardinal 
principle 
of 
the 
Lutheran 
Reformation, 
— 
the 
liberty 
of 
reason. 
He 
was 
one 
of 
the 
first 
to 
treat 
unbelief, 
from 
the 
side 
of 
religion, 
as 
an 
error 
of 
judgment, 
not 
as 
rebellion 
against 
rightful 
authority. 
The 
latter 
was 
and 
is 
the 
Romanist 
view. 
The 
former 
is 
the 
Protestant 
theory, 
but 
was 
not 
then, 
and 
is 
not 
always 
now, 
the 
Protestant 
practice. 
Theology 
then 
was 
not 
concerned 
to 
vindicate 
the 
reason 
or 
the 
goodness 
of 
God. 
It 
gloried 
in 
his 
physical 
strength 
by 
which 
he 
would 
finally 
crush 
dissenters 
from 
orthodoxy. 
Leibnitz 
knew 
no 
authority 
independent 
of 
Reason, 
and 
no 
God 
but 
the 
Supreme 
Reason 
directing 
Almighty 
Good-will. 
The 
philosophic 
conclusion 
justly 
deducible 
from 
this 
view 
of 
God, 
let 
cavillers 
say 
what 
they 
will, 
is 
Optimism. 
Accordingly, 
Optimism, 
or 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
best 
possible 
world, 
is 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
“Théodicée.” 
Our 
limits 
will 
not 
permit 
us 
to 
analyze 
the 
argumentofthis 
remarkablework. 
Bunsen 
says, 
“It 
necessarily 
failed 
because 
it 
was 
a 
not 
quite 
honest 
compound 
of 
speculation 
and 
divinity.”32 


Few 
at 
the 
present 
day 
will 
pretend 
to 
be 
entirely 
satisfied 
with 
its 
reasoning, 
but 
allwhoare 
familiarwithitknow 
it 
tobe 
a 
treasury 
of 
wise 
and 
profound 
thoughts 
and 
of 
noble 
sentiments 
and 
aspirations. 
Bonnet, 
the 
naturalist, 
called 
it 
his 
“Manual 
of 
Christian 
Philosophy”; 
and 
Fontenelle, 
in 



his 
eulogy, 
speaks 
enthusiastically 
of 
its 
luminous 
and 
sublime 
views, 
of 
its 
reasonings, 
in 
which 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
geometer 
is 
always 
apparent, 
of 
its 
perfect 
fairness 
toward 
those 
whom 
it 
controverts, 
and 
its 
rich 
store 
of 
anecdote 
and 
illustration. 
Even 
Stewart, 
who 
was 
not 
familiar 
with 
it, 
and 
who, 
as 
might 
be 
expected, 
strangely 
misconceives 
and 
misrepresents 
the 
author, 
is 
compelled 
to 
echo 
the 
general 
sentiment. 
He 
pronounces 
it 
a 
work 
in 
which 
are 
combined 
together 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
degree 
“the 
acuteness 
of 
the 
logician, 
the 
imagination 
of 
the 
poet, 
and 
the 
impenetrable 
yet 
sublime 
darkness 
of 
the 
metaphysical 
theologian.” 
The 
Italics 
are 
ours. 
Our 
reason 
for 
doubting 
Stewart’s 
familiarity 
with 
the 
“Théodicée,” 
and 
with 
Leibnitz 
in 
general, 
is 
derived 
in 
part 
from 
these 
phrases. 
We 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
any 
sincere 
student 
of 
Leibnitz 
has 
found 
him 
dark 
and 
impenetrable. 
Be 
it 
a 
merit 
or 
a 
fault, 
this 
predicate 
is 
inapplicable. 
Never 
was 
metaphysician 
more 
explicit 
and 
more 
intelligible. 
Had 
he 
been 
disposed 
to 
mysticize 
and 
to 
shroud 
himself 
in 
“impenetrable 
darkness,” 
he 
would 
have 
found 
it 
difficult 
to 
indulge 
that 
propensity 
in 
French. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
strict 
régime 
and 
happy 
limitations 
of 
that 
idiom, 
the 
French 
is 
not 
a 
language 
in 
which 
philosophy 
can 
hide 
itself. 
It 
is 
a 
tight-fitting 
coat, 
which 
shows 
the 
exact 
form, 
or 
want 
of 
form, 
of 
the 
thought 
it 
clothes, 
without 
pad 
or 
fold 
to 
simulate 
fulness 
or 
to 
veil 
defects. 
It 
was 
a 
Frenchman, 
we 
are 
aware, 
who 
discovered 
that 
“the 
use 
of 
language 
is 
to 
conceal 
thought”; 
but 
that 
use, 
so 
far 
as 
French 
is 
concerned,hasbeenhithertomonopolized 
bydiplomacy. 


Another 
reason 
for 
questioning 
Stewart’s 
familiarity 
with 
Leibnitz 
is 
his 
misconception 
of 
that 
author, 
which 
we 
choose 
to 
impute 
to 
ignorance 
rather 
than 
to 
wilfulness. 
This 
misconception 
is 
strikingly 
exemplified 
in 
a 
prominentpoint 
of 
Leibnitian 
philosophy. 
Stewartsays: 
“The 
zeal 
of 
Leibnitz 
in 
propagating 
the 
dogma 
of 
Necessity 
is 
not 
easily 
reconcilable 
with 
the 



hostility 
which 
he 
uniformly 
displays 
against 
the 
congenial 
doctrine 
of 
Materialism.”33 


Now 
it 
happens 
that 
“the 
zeal 
of 
Leibnitz” 
was 
exerted 
in 
precisely 
the 
opposite 
direction. 
A 
considerable 
section 
of 
the 
“Théodicée” 
(34-75) 
is 
occupied 
with 
the 
illustration 
and 
defence 
of 
the 
Freedom 
of 
the 
Will. 
It 
was 
a 
doctrine 
on 
which 
he 
laid 
great 
stress, 
and 
which 
forms 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
his 
system;34 
in 
proof 
of 
which, 
let 
one 
declaration 
stand 
for 
many: 
“Je 
suis 
d’opinion 
que 
notre 
volonté 
n’est 
pas 
seulement 
exempte 
de 
la 
contrainte, 
mais 
encore 
de 
la 
nécessité.” 
How 
far 
he 
succeeded 
in 
establishing 
that 
doctrine 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
system 
is 
another 
question. 
That 
he 
believed 
it 
and 
taught 
it 
is 
a 
fact 
of 
which 
there 
can 
be 
no 
more 
doubt 
with 
those 
who 
have 
studied 
his 
writings, 
than 
there 
is 
that 
he 
wrote 
the 
works 
ascribed 
to 
him. 
But 
the 
freedom 
of 
will 
maintained 
by 
Leibnitz 
was 
not 
indeterminism. 
It 
was 
not 
the 
indifference 
of 
the 
tongue 
of 
the 
balance 
between 
equal 
weights, 
or 
that 
of 
the 
ass 
between 
equal 
bundles 
of 
hay. 
Such 
an 
equilibrium 
he 
declares 
impossible. 
“Cet 
équilibre 
en 
tout 
sens 
est 
impossible.” 
Buridan’s 
imaginary 
case 
of 
the 
ass 
is 
a 
fiction 
“qui 
ne 
sauroit 
avoirlieudansl’univers.” 
35 


The 
will 
is 
always 
determined 
by 
motives, 
but 
not 
necessarily 
constrained 
by 
them. 
This 
is 
his 
doctrine, 
emphatically 
stated 
and 
zealously 
maintained. 
We 
doubt 
if 
any 
philosopher, 
equally 
profound 
and 
equally 
sincere, 
will 
ever 
find 
room 
in 
his 
conclusions 
for 
a 
greater 
measure 
of 
moral 
liberty 
than 
the 
“Théodicée” 
has 
conceded 
to 
man. 
“In 
respect 
to 
this 
matter,” 
says 
Arthur 
Schopenhauer, 
“the 
great 
thinkers 
of 
all 
times 
are 
agreed 
and 
decided, 
just 
as 
surely 
as 
the 
mass 
of 
mankind 
will 
never 
see 
and 
comprehend 
the 
great 
truth, 
that 
the 
practical 
operation 
of 
liberty 
is 
not 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
single 
acts, 
but 
in 
thebeingandnatureofman.”36 



Leibnitz’s 
construction 
of 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
possible 
liberty 
consistent 
with 
the 
preëstablished 
order 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
substantially 
that 
of 
Schelling 
in 
his 
celebrated 
essay 
on 
this 
subject. 
We 
must 
not 
dwell 
upon 
it, 
but 
hasten 
to 
concludeourimperfectsketch. 


The 
ground-idea 
of 
the 
“Théodicée” 
is 
expressed 
in 
the 
phrase, 
“Bestpossible 
world.” 
Evil 
is 
a 
necessary 
condition 
of 
finite 
being, 
but 
the 
end 
of 
creation 
is 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
greatest 
possible 
perfection 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
finite. 
The 
existing 
universe 
is 
one 
of 
innumerable 
possible 
universes, 
each 
of 
which, 
if 
actualized, 
would 
have 
had 
a 
different 
measure 
of 
good 
and 
evil. 
The 
present, 
rather 
than 
any 
other, 
was 
made 
actual, 
as 
presenting 
to 
Divine 
Intelligence 
the 
smallest 
measure 
of 
evil 
and 
the 
greatest 
amount 
of 
good. 
This 
idea 
is 
happily 
embodied 
in 
the 
closing 
apologue, 
designed 
to 
supplement 
one 
of 
Laurentius 
Valla, 
a 
writer 
of 
the 
fifteenth 
century. 
Theodorus, 
priest 
of 
Zeus 
at 
Dodona, 
demands 
why 
that 
god 
has 
permitted 
to 
Sextus 
the 
evil 
will 
which 
was 
destined 
to 
bring 
so 
much 
misery 
on 
himself 
and 
others. 
Zeus 
refers 
him 
to 
his 
daughter 
Athene. 
He 
goes 
to 
Athens, 
is 
commanded 
to 
lie 
down 
in 
the 
temple 
of 
Pallas, 
and 
is 
there 
visited 
with 
a 
dream. 
The 
vision 
takes 
him 
to 
the 
Palace 
of 
Destinies, 
which 
contains 
the 
plans 
of 
all 
possible 
worlds. 
He 
examines 
one 
plan 
after 
another; 
in 
each 
the 
same 
Sextus 
plays 
a 
different 
part 
and 
experiences 
a 
different 
fate. 
The 
plans 
improve 
as 
he 
advances, 
till 
at 
last 
he 
comes 
upon 
one 
whose 
superior 
excellence 
enchants 
him 
with 
delight. 
After 
revelling 
awhile 
in 
the 
contemplation 
of 
this 
perfect 
world, 
he 
is 
told 
that 
this 
is 
the 
actual 
world 
in 
which 
he 
lives. 
But 
in 
this 
the 
crime 
of 
Sextus 
is 
a 
necessary 
constituent; 
it 
couldnotbewhatitisas 
awhole,wereitotherthanitisinitssingle 
parts. 


Whatever 
may 
be 
thought 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
success 
in 
demonstrating 
his 
favoritedoctrine, 
the 
theory 
of 
Optimism 
commends 
itselftopiety 
andreason 
as 
that 
view 
of 
human 
and 
divine 
things 
which 
most 
redounds 
to 
the 
glory 
of 



God 
and 
best 
expresses 
the 
hope 
of 
man, 
— 
as 
the 
noblest 
and 
therefore 
the 
truesttheoryof 
Divineruleandhuman 
destiny. 


We 
recall 
at 
this 
moment 
but 
one 
English 
writer 
of 
supreme 
mark 
who 
has 
held 
and 
promulged, 
in 
its 
fullest 
extent, 
the 
theory 
of 
Optimism. 
That 
one 
is 
a 
poet. 
The 
“Essay 
on 
Man,” 
with 
one 
or 
two 
exceptions, 
might 
almost 
pass 
for 
a 
paraphrase 
of 
the 
“Théodicée”; 
and 
Pope, 
with 
characteristic 
vigor, 
has 
concentrated 
the 
meaning 
of 
that 
treatise 
in 
one 
word, 
which 
is 
none 
the 
less 
true, 
in 
the 
sense 
intended, 
because 
of 
its 
possible 
perversion,— 
“Whatever 
is,isright.”

Entelechy 
(έντελέχεια) 
is 
an 
Aristotelian 
term, 
signifying 
activity, 
or 
more 
properly 
perhaps, 
self 
action. 
Leibnitz 
understands 
by 
it 
something 
complete 
in 
itself 
(ἔχον 
τδ 
έντελές). 
Mr. 
Butler, 
in 
his 
History 
of 
Ancient 
Philosophy, 
lately 
reprinted 
in 
this 
country, 
translates 
it 
“act.” 
Function, 
we 
think 
would 
be 
a 
better 
rendering. 
(See

Archer 
Butler’s

Aristotle 
uses 
the

two

the

Rewritten 
(1899) 
byCharles 
SandersPeirce 



From 
‘La 
Nouvelle 
Monadologie’ 


The 
nature 
of 
things 
would 
seem 
to 
have 
a 
screw 
loose 
if 
the 
powers 
of 
a 
Renouvier 
are 
not 
to 
be 
of 
service 
to 
the 
race. 
When 
we 
see 
a 
man 
far 
advanced 
in 
the 
eighties 
producing, 
albeit 
with 
a 
collaborator, 
a 
great 
volume 
of 
metaphysics, 
terse, 
clear, 
and 
well-oriented, 
it 
is 
certainly 
not 
on 
his 
shoulders 
that 
we 
can 
lay 
the 
blame 
if 
his 
industry 
should 
teach 
the 
world 
nothing. 
The 
principles 
of 
Renouvier’s 
philosophy 
were 
published 
in 
the 
earlier 
years 
of 
the 
Second 
Empire, 
with 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
a 
too 
modest 
title. 
It 
was 
mainly 
other 
causes, 
however, 
that 
at 
first 
prevented 
the 
work 
from 
being 
as 
much 
studied 
as 
it 
deserved 
to 
be. 
Of 
late 
years 
it 
has 
in 
France 
been, 
perhaps, 
more 
studied 
than 
it 
deserved 
to 
be; 
but 
it 
has 
not 
been 
as 
well 
studied 
as 
it 
deserved 
to 
be. 
The 
author 
belonged 
to 
that 
group 
of 
schools 
in 
which 
the 
ideas 
of 
Kant 
were 
still 
paramount. 
Those 
schools 
never 
fully 
ripened 
their 
fruit, 
because 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
strongest 
men 
was 
turned 
away 
to 
the 
rich 
conceptions 
that 
the 
mechanical 
theory 
of 
heat 
and 
the 
Darwinian 
hypothesis 
about 
that 
time 
suggested. 
None 
of 
the 
Kantians 
had 
more 
thoroughly 
learned 
their 
master’s 
great 
lesson 
than 
this 
Frenchman-the 
lesson 
that 
metaphysics 
can 
be 
solidly 
founded 
only 
upon 
the 
science 
of 
logic. 
Unfortunately, 
Kant, 
though 
a 
logical 
Samson, 
had 
yet 
treated 
that 
science 
with 
what 
we 
can 
but 
call, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
importance 
he 
attributed 
to 
it, 
inexcusable 
levity; 
and 
his 
followers 
had 
always 
accepted 
his 
logical 
dicta 
most 
uncritically, 
Just 
as 
they 
have 
ever 
since 
continued 
to 
do. 
The 
aliment 
contained 
in 
De 
Morgan’s 
and 
Boole’s 
studies 
had 
not 
been 
assimilated 
by 
anybody; 
nor 
had 
mathematical 
reasoning 
taken 
on 
its 
modern 
exactitude. 
What 
was 
meant, 
in 
that 
Quarterly 
Review 
period, 
by 
good 
logic 
had 
for 
its 



principal 
ingredient 
a 
forcible 
and 
imposing 
style 
of 
writing. 
Renouvier 
was, 
and 
is, 
not 
only 
an 
able 
logician 
in 
that 
sense, 
after 
the 
best 
French 
models, 
but 
even 
according 
to 
the 
more 
scientific 
standard 
of 
mediaeval 
Paris. 
But 
now, 
fifty 
years 
after 
his 
acme, 
if 
we 
demand 
that 
he 
shall 
satisfy 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
exact 
logic 
which 
has 
since 
grown 
up, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
we 
find 
he 
falls 
so 
far 
short 
of 
it 
that 
his 
conclusions 
as 
a 
whole 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
accepted. 
At 
many 
points 
his 
well-elaborated 
thought 
would 
be 
extremely 
valuable 
if 
some 
modern 
logician 
of 
the 
first 
strength 
would 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
disentangle 
it 
from 
other 
elements 
with 
which 
it 
is 
interlaced. 
It 
is 
lamentable 
that 
such 
a 
labor 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
get 
performed, 
since 
M. 
Prat 
has 
not 
proved 
adequate 
to 
the 
task, 
and 
yet 
one 
does 
not 
find 
where 
to 
lay 
the 
blame 
for 
its 
non-performance 
unless 
it 
be 
upon 
the 
logic 
of 
events 
and 
thenatureof 
things. 


The 
present 
work 
undertakes 
the 
noble 
task 
of 
rewriting 
the 
so-called 
‘Monadologie’ 
of 
Leibniz, 
and 
of 
more 
fully 
developing 
its 
philosophy 
after 
indispensable 
corrections. 
The 
doctrine 
is 
very 
nearly 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
his 
first 
philosophical 
treatise 
from 
which 
he 
at 
one 
time 
seemed 
to 
be 
wandering. 
The 
‘Monadologie’ 
is 
rewritten 
in 
a 
Kantian 
spirit; 
and 
as 
time 
increases 
the 
distance 
from 
which 
we 
survey 
the 
Kantian 
philosophy, 
its 
affinitieswith 
thatofLeibnizappearcloserthantheyformerlydid. 


We 
cannot 
give 
much 
idea 
of 
what 
has 
been 
packed 
into 
these 
five 
hundred-odd 
pages, 
further 
than 
to 
say 
that 
they 
discuss 
most 
of 
the 
usual 
problems 
of 
metaphysics 
and 
much 
besides. 
The 
main 
doctrine 
is 
that 
of 
Leibniz, 
that 
the 
universe 
is 
composed 
of 
units, 
indivisible 
and 
endowed 
with 
consciousness. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
preëstablished 
harmony 
is 
retained-that 
the 
monads 
do 
not 
act 
on 
one 
another 
in 
any 
other 
sense 
than 
that 
while 
each 
one 
follows 
out 
its 
own 
destiny 
in 
the 
succession 
of 
its 
modifications 
of 
consciousness, 
these 
have 
been 
arranged 
so 
as 
to 
harmonize 
and 
to 
amount 



practically 
to 
actions 
upon 
one 
another. 
But 
here 
the 
authors 
bid 
farewell 
to 
Leibniz. 
The 
law 
of 
sufficient 
reason 
is 
hardly 
mentioned 
in 
the 
book, 
but 
is 
practically 
rejected 
in 
every 
aspect 
of 
it. 
Of 
course, 
with 
this 
law 
the 
bottom 
of 
optimism 
falls 
out. 
In 
place 
of 
Leibniz’ 
principle 
of 
the 
identity 
of 
indiscernibles, 
that 
things 
other 
than 
one 
another 
must 
differ 
in 
some 
qualities, 
Scotus’s 
doctrine 
of 
hecceity 
(substantially 
that 
of 
Kant)is 
adopted-
that 
individual 
existence 
is 
no 
general 
character, 
but 
is 
an 
irrational 
act. 
An 
important 
departure 
from 
Leibniz 
is 
the 
rejection 
of 
all 
actual 
infinite 
multitude 
(and 
hence, 
of 
all 
continuity) 
as 
self-contradictory. 
Kantian 
nominalism 
is 
carried 
to 
an 
extreme, 
every 
conception 
of 
intellectual 
value 
(space, 
time, 
etc.) 
being 
regarded 
as 
untrue 
of 
substances. 
Kant 
himself 
allows 
us 
to 
surmise 
that 
there 
is 
some 
unintelligible 
root 
from 
which 
each 
special 
appearance 
springs, 
although 
all 
that 
makes 
them 
intelligible 
is 
our 
own 
embroidery. 
But 
in 
this 
monadism 
the 
nakedness 
of 
the 
thing 
in 
itself 
is 
laid 
bare, 
and 
it 
plainly 
appears 
that 
nothing 
exists 
but 
monads 
and 
their 
harmonizing 
dreams. 
A 
single 
monad, 
we 
are 
told, 
transcends 
the 
limits 
of 
possibleexperience,althoughsomefinitecollection 
ofthemis 
cognizable. 


The 
position 
of 
Renouvier 
concerning 
determinism 
has 
excited 
enough 
curiosity 
to 
make 
it 
worth 
defining. 
Five 
opinions 
on 
this 
subject 
are 
current 
to-day. 
Thecommonone, 
whichmaybeattributedtoBoyle,isthatnatureisa 
machine 
working 
according 
to 
exact 
laws 
(like 
the 
differential 
equations 
of 
dynamics), 
while 
the 
conditions 
to 
which 
those 
laws 
apply 
(like 
the 
constants 
of 
integration) 
are 
entirely 
arbitrary. 
Or, 
this 
may 
be 
expressed 
by 
saying 
that 
Nature 
syllogizes 
in 
her 
action; 
the 
ultimate 
major 
premises 
being 
laws, 
and 
the 
ultimate 
minor 
premises 
irrational 
facts. 
There 
are 
two 
opinions 
more 
deterministic 
than 
this. 
The 
first 
is 
that 
even 
the 
initial 
conditions 
of 
the 
universe 
are 
perfectly 
regular. 
This 
opinion 
still 
leaves 
room 
for 
accidents, 
such, 
for 
example, 
as 
that 
a 
number 
of 
bodies 
should 
at 
one 
instant 
come 
into 



symmetrical 
positions. 
The 
extreme 
of 
determinism, 
held 
by 
Leibniz, 
supposes 
that 
every 
aspect 
of 
every 
fact 
is 
subject 
to 
reason, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
a 
special 
Providence 
in 
the 
fall 
of 
a 
sparrow. 
There 
remain 
two 
opinions 
less 
deterministic 
than 
the 
common 
one. 
One 
of 
these, 
which 
has 
been 
called 
Tychism, 
is 
that 
there 
are 
minute 
departures 
in 
nature 
from 
any 
general 
formula 
which 
can 
be 
assigned, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
element 
of 
absolute 
chance. 
This 
is 
the 
position 
maintained 
by 
C. 
S. 
Peirce 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
in 
the 
Monist. 
It 
had 
already 
been 
held 
by 
Boutroux, 
quite 
incidentally, 
however, 
and 
not 
as 
a 
prominent 
feature 
of 
his 
argument 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
contingency 
of 
natural 
laws. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
opinion 
of 
Renouvier. 
He 
holds 
that 
all 
causality 
is 
exact 
and 
produces 
its 
component 
effect, 
but 
that, 
in 
addition, 
there 
are 
component 
influences 
which 
spring 
direct 
from 
the 
arbitrary 
action 
of 
the 
monad. 
Perhaps 
Boutroux 
had 
in 
mind 
something 
like 
this 
when 
he 
spoke 
of 
“une 
sorte 
de 
jeu 
laissé 
aux 
cadres 
logiques.” 
These 
actions, 
though 
arbitrary 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
not 
being 
rational 
functions 
of 
preceding 
events, 
are 
all 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
preestablished 
harmony, 
and 
thus 
duly 
produce 
their 
component 
effects 
(or 
quasi-effects)uponothermonads. 


Three 
critical 
questions 
are 
apposite 
to 
the 
new 
monadism. 
The 
first 
is, 
Supposing 
we 
were 
to 
grant 
all 
its 
propositions, 
how 
far 
would 
it 
constitute 
a 
satisfactory 
philosophy? 
What 
is 
it 
that 
philosophy 
ultimately 
hopes 
to 
accomplish? 
It 
is, 
if 
we 
mistake 
not, 
to 
find 
that 
there 
is 
some 
intelligible 
truth, 
some 
absolutely 
valid 
reasonableness, 
to 
ascertain 
how 
far 
this 
reasonableness 
governs 
the 
universe, 
and 
to 
learn 
how 
we 
may 
best 
do 
its 
service. 
It 
may 
be 
this 
hope 
is 
not 
destined 
to 
be 
realized, 
although, 
being 
reasonable, 
it 
acts 
to 
strengthen 
itself. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
reasonableness 
essentially 
requires 
an 
element 
of 
unreason, 
a 
brute 
force, 
on 
which 
and 
with 
which 
to 
accomplish 
itself; 
but 
in 
that 
case 
we 
hope 
that 
this 
unreason 
may 
turn 
out 
capable 
of 
becoming 
infused 
with 
reason. 
There 
must 
be 
nothing 



hopelessly 
and 
finally 
unreasonable, 
or 
in 
so 
far 
philosophy 
is 
to 
no 
purpose 
and 
its 
hope 
is 
vain. 
But 
the 
new 
monadism 
presents 
many 
such 
irrational 
features. 
What 
possible 
reason 
can 
there 
be 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
precise 
finite 
number 
of 
monads 
that 
there 
are, 
rather 
than 
for 
one 
more? 
Since 
the 
monads 
do 
not 
metaphysically 
act 
upon 
one 
another, 
what 
rational 
purpose 
is 
subserved 
by 
the 
real 
existence 
of 
so 
many? 
The 
mere 
dream 
of 
them 
by 
one 
would 
do 
as 
well. 
Why 
should 
each 
monad 
have 
the 
three 
peculiar 
characters 
of 
intelligence, 
passion, 
and 
will, 
or 
why 
should 
any 
phenomena 
be 
as 
they 
are? 
In 
short, 
the 
absolutely 
inexplicable 
pervades 
the 
whole 
system, 
while 
one 
supremely 
antirational 
nominalismis 
supreme 
over 
the 
whole. 
Continuity 
is 
nothing 
but 
that 
modification 
of 
generality 
which 
is 
proper 
to 
the 
logic 
of 
relatives; 
and 
generality 
is 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
rationality. 
Yet 
this 
new 
monadism 
makes 
all 
continuity 
a 
false 
illusion 
and 
all 
generality 
equally 
so. 
Persuade 
him 
that 
this 
is 
true, 
and 
what 
is 
there 
for 
a 
philosopher 
but 
to 
hug 
a 
delusion 
to 
his 
heart 
as 
being, 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
reasonableness, 
infinitely 
more 
real 
than 
the 
wretched 
abortion 
that 
the 
world 
of 
reality 
would 
so 
turn 
out 
to 
be? 
Rather 
hope 
that 
some 
corrected 
Hegelianism 
is 
the 
truth, 
or, 
better 
still, 
that, 
as 
the 
elder 
James 
taught, 
the 
Reasonable 
One 
sets 
off 
over 
against 
himself 
an 
irrational 
phantom 
upon 
which 
his 
warmth 
and 
light 
may 
be 
broughttopass. 


The 
second 
question 
is, 
how 
far 
the 
reasoning 
of 
this 
work 
is 
sound. 
The 
opening 
section 
sets 
forth 
that 
conception 
of 
a 
simple 
substance 
which 
is 
the 
very 
cornerstone 
of 
monadism, 
without 
which 
the 
whole 
erection 
would 
crumble. 
Nobody 
is 
unaware 
that 
most 
thinkers 
now 
reject 
anysuchidea. 
The 
subject 
of 
an 
attribute, 
they 
say, 
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
group 
of 
phenomena 
differing 
from 
a 
metaphysical 
substance 
in 
not 
being 
permanent, 
like 
that 
old 
jackknife. 
Even 
Kant 
declared 
the 
conception 
of 
substance 
has 
no 
validity 
beyond 
possible 
experience. 
It 
was 
incumbent 
on 
our 
authors, 
then, 
to 
begin 



by 
proving 
that 
there 
is 
any 
substance 
other 
than 
the 
universe 
as 
a 
whole. 
Instead 
of 
this, 
they 
so 
naively 
take 
the 
matter 
for 
granted 
as 
to 
give 
a 
definition 
of 
substance 
which 
would 
make 
it 
a 
mere 
way 
of 
thinking. 
They 
parade 
a 
pretended 
demonstration 
that 
a 
contradiction 
is 
involved 
in 
supposing 
a 
substance 
to 
be 
infinitely 
divisible, 
or, 
what 
is 
precisely 
the 
same 
thing 
(though 
they 
do 
not 
so 
treat 
it), 
in 
supposing 
an 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
substances. 
We 
will 
not 
stop 
to 
point 
out 
the 
glaring 
fallacy 
of 
that 
“demonstration.” 
Modern 
logic 
enables 
us 
to 
show 
that 
it 
is 
absurd 
to 
say 
there 
is 
a 
contradiction 
in 
supposing 
an 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
substances. 
There 
is 
certainly 
an 
infinite 
multitude 
of 
finite 
whole 
numbers. 
True, 
these 
are 
only 
possibilities, 
not 
substances. 
But 
according 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
hecceity, 
admitted 
by 
the 
authors, 
mere 
substantial 
existence 
is 
no 
general 
character 
and 
cannot 
create 
a 
contradiction. 
In 
other 
words, 
what 
is 
possibly 
possibleispossiblyactual. 


How 
far 
can 
this 
work 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
natural 
perfecting 
of 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Leibniz? 
Leibniz 
had 
more 
sides 
than 
one. 
If 
we 
consider 
him 
as 
above 
all 
else 
an 
extreme 
nominalist, 
and 
expunge 
from 
his 
celebrated 
paper 
all 
that 
tends 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
the 
development 
of 
what 
would 
remain 
might 
not 
be 
very 
different 
from 
the 
nouvelle 
monadologie 
minus 
its 
free-will 
doctrine. 
But 
if 
we 
deem 
a 
man 
to 
be 
best 
represented 
by 
that 
one 
of 
his 
ideas 
which 
shows 
most 
prepotency, 
it 
is 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
differential 
calculus 
that 
we 
must 
look 
for 
the 
genuine 
Leibniz, 
and 
in 
philosophy 
we 
must 
regard 
the 
law 
of 
continuity 
as 
most 
Leibnizian. 
This 
principle 
would 
at 
once 
do 
away 
with 
the 
isolated 
monads, 
and 
render 
the 
extravagant 
and 
unverifiable 
hypothesis 
of 
preëstablished 
harmony 
superfluous 
by 
directly 
solving 
the 
riddle 
of 
the

of

THEADAMSON 
LECTURE,1910 


In 
an 
early 
chapter 
of 
the 
book 
which 
must 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
chief 
literary 
monument 
of 
the 
late 
Professor 
Adamson’s 
great 
intellectual 
powers 
in 
one 
of 
those 
Lectures 
on 
the 
Development 
of 
Modern 
Philosophy 
in 
which 
every 
sentence 
seems 
to 
fall 
weightily 
from 
unfaltering 
lips 
and 
the 
superfluous 
is 
shunned 
with 
uncompromising 
directness 
— 
there 
is 
a 
brief 
explanation 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
central 
idea 
of 
Leibniz’ 
philosophy 
was 
never 
systematically 
worked 
out 
by 
him. 
“ 
No 
doubt,” 
says 
Adamson, 
“the 
main 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
enormous 
varied 
activity 
of 
a 
public 
kind 
which 
fills 
the 
life 
of 
Leibniz 
from 
1676 
on 
to 
his 
death” 
[in 
1716]. 
“ 
In 
all 
the 
great 
movements 
of 
religion 
and 
politics 
he 
shared 
largely; 
expended 
infinite 
time 
and 
energy 
on 
the 
perfectly 
hopeless 
task 
of 
striving 
to 
reunite 
the 
Protestant 
and 
Catholic 
Churches, 
laboured 
with 
greater 
success 
to 
bring 
about, 
by 
the 
foundation 
of 
academies 
of 
science 
in 
the 
capitals 
of 
Europe, 
a 
kind 
of 
community 
of 
learned 
men; 
and 
was 
the 
first 
to 
project 
what 
is 
even 
yet 
incomplete 
— 
adetailedand 
comprehensivehistory 
ofthefortunes 
ofvarious 
European 
states. 
His 
public 
work, 
indeed, 
would 
have 
amply 
occupied 
the 
energies 
of 
a 
more 
ordinary 
man. 
It 
is 
not 
surprising, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
philosophical 
writings 
of 
these 
later 
years 
are 
fragmentary, 
that 
the 
most 
important 
points 
are 
often 
advanced 
in 
occasional 
correspondence, 
and 
that 
the 
most 
condensed 
statement 
of 
his 
views 
requires 
for 
its 
elucidation 
reference 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
incomplete 
sketches 
and 
plans 
of 
undeveloped 
works 
nevercarriedintoexecution.” 



When, 
by 
the 
indulgent 
choice 
of 
old 
colleagues 
and 
friends, 
I 
was 
invited 
to 
deliver 
a 
lecture 
in 
connexion 
with 
a 
foundation 
established 
to 
perpetuate 
Professor 
Adamson 
s 
memory 
in 
a 
University 
in 
the 
building 
up 
of 
which 
he 
had 
a 
large 
share, 
I 
hardly 
knew 
whether 
I 
should 
be 
doing 
honour 
to 
that 
memory 
by 
accepting 
the 
invitation. 
But, 
searching, 
as 
I 
may 
confess 
to 
you, 
for 
excuses 
which 
might, 
at 
all 
events 
in 
my 
own 
eyes, 
palliate 
my 
presumptuousness 
in 
following 
a 
natural 
impulse, 
I 
remembered 
that 
in 
a 
course 
of 
public 
lectures 
which 
we 
had 
organised 
in 
this 
College 
not 
long 
before 
Professor 
Adamson 
transferred 
his 
services 
to 
one 
of 
the 
chosen 
seminaries 
of 
philosophical 
study 
north 
of 
the 
Tweed, 
his 
friendly 
disregard 
of 
my 
unfitness 
for 
the 
match 
actually 
went 
so 
far 
as 
to 
allow 
me 
to 
associate 
myself 
with 
him 
in 
a 
continued 
series 
of 
discourses, 
of 
which, 
I 
need 
hardly 
say, 
all 
the 
honours 
remained 
with 
him. 
Thus 
it 
occurred 
to 
me 
that 
you 
might 
be 
willing, 
on 
the 
present 
occasion 
also, 
to 
regard 
what 
I 
have 
to 
offer 
you 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
supplement 
or 
excursus 
to 
a 
passage 
in 
one 
of 
his 
own 
admirable 
lectures. 
For 
the 
rest, 
I 
have 
long 
thought 
that, 
while 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
no 
great 
man 
and 
no 
great 
life 
can 
be 
thoroughly 
understood 
unless 
they 
are 
viewed 
under 
all 
their 
main 
aspects, 
so 
nothing 
can 
be 
more 
futile, 
when 
seeking 
to 
form 
or 
formulate 
a 
judgment 
of 
a 
great 
individual 
force 
in 
history 
or 
in 
life, 
than 
the 
resolute 
exclusion 
even 
of 
a 
subsidiary 
aspect, 
because 
its 
significance 
is 
only 
secondary. 
And 
to 
no 
man 
does 
this 
apply 
more 
fully 
than 
to 
Leibniz, 
whose 
intellectual 
activity, 
more 
varied 
than 
that 
of 
any 
but 
a 
very 
few 
moderns, 
was 
singularly 
consistent 
with 
itself 
and 
with 
the 
desire 
for 
harmony 
which 
so 
largely 
shaped 
his 
thought 
and 
swayed 
his 
philosophy. 
I 
say 
moderns, 
for 
to 
what 
ancient 
sage 
would 
not 
the 
very 
notion 
of 
an 
intellectual 
activity 
labelled 
in 
different 
directions 
like 
a 
sign-post 
have 
seemedpreposterous? 



And 
yet, 
were 
I 
to 
attempt 
in 
the 
course 
of 
our 
brief 
hour 
to 
present 
even 
the 
merest 
outline 
of 
what 
Professor 
Adamson, 
using 
the 
word 
in 
its 
narrower 
sense, 
describes 
as 
the 
public 
work 
of 
Leibniz, 
no 
epitome 
could 
ever 
have 
fallen 
further 
short 
of 
the 
relative 
usefulness 
of 
a 
summary. 
I 
should 
in 
no 
case 
have 
wished 
to 
say 
anything 
as 
to 
his 
scientific 
and 
historical 
work 
proper 
in 
the 
former 
case 
because 
of 
my 
utter 
incompetence 
to 
form 
an 
estimate 
of 
it, 
in 
the 
latter 
because 
its 
value 
lies 
in 
qualities 
which, 
while 
they 
are 
in 
perfect 
accordance 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
Leibniz 
s 
intellectual 
labours 
at 
large, 
hardly 
lend 
themselves 
to 
illustration 
or 
exposition 
on 
an 
occasion 
like 
the 
present. 
I 
shall 
return 
to 
the 
Annales 
Brunsvicenses 
from 
a 
different 
point 
of 
view 
before 
I 
close. 
Here, 
it 
will 
suffice 
to 
observe 
that, 
to 
quote 
from 
the 
late 
Ernst 
Curtius 
s 
brilliant 
oration 
on 
the 
Leibniz 
Day 
of 
the 
Berlin 
Academy 
in 
1873, 
“ 
though 
no 
theoretical 
connexion 
exists 
between 
those 
Annals 
and 
the 
doctrine 
of 
monads, 
yet 
Leibniz 
in 
his 
historical 
labours 
once 
more 
proved 
himself 
the 
great 
organiser 
of 
intellectual 
work, 
rightly 
perceiving 
what 
was 
really 
necessary 
for 
the 
foundation 
of 
a 
science 
of 
history, 
viz. 
the 
collection 
of 
documents 
and 
the 
investigation 
of 
sources, 
and 
thus 
setting 
a 
splendid 
example 
of 
painstaking 
and 
self-denying 
labour 
on 
the 
materialathisdisposal.” 


For, 
apart 
from 
these, 
there 
was 
hardly 
a 
field 
of 
human 
knowledge 
bearing 
on 
government 
and 
society 
with 
which 
he 
was 
unfamiliar 
and 
the 
cultivation 
of 
which 
he 
failed 
to 
advance; 
so 
that 
the 
very 
limitation 
which 
I 
have 
sought 
to 
impose 
upon 
myself 
by 
treating 
of 
Leibniz 
as 
a 
politician 
only 
does 
not, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
exclude 
all 
that 
I 
am 
forced 
to 
omit. 
Leibniz 
for 
instance, 
was 
a 
trained 
student 
of 
Law 
both 
civil 
and 
canonical, 
and, 
like 
all 
great 
jurists 
for 
I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
exception 
could 
be 
cited 
to 
the 
generalisation 
— 
he 
was, 
at 
all 
events 
in 
principle, 
an 
advocate 
of 
legal 
reform. 
The 
penal 
system 
which 
he 
found 
in 
existence 
in 
his 
own 
country 



was 
a 
special 
object 
of 
his 
critical 
study, 
and 
of 
the 
procedure 
in 
vogue 
against 
witches 
and 
witchcraft 
one 
of 
the 
lingering 
blemishes 
on 
the 
face 
of 
Western 
civilisation 
— 
he 
was 
a 
resolute 
opponent. 
He 
was, 
again, 
a 
political 
economist 
in 
days 
when 
the 
very 
basis 
for 
the 
application 
of 
economic 
principles 
was 
almost 
everywhere 
wanting. 
He 
was 
interested 
in 
the 
progress 
of 
industry 
and 
trade, 
predicting, 
almost 
a 
century 
before 
it 
became 
a 
great 
historical 
fact, 
the 
enormous 
value 
of 
the 
use 
of 
machinery 
in 
whatcontinued, 
by 
a 
long-lived 
misnomer, 
to 
be 
called 
manufacturing 
industry; 
but 
he 
was 
not 
less 
solicitous 
for 
the 
maintenance 
and 
development 
of 
agriculture, 
and 
is 
foundupbraidingthe 
Whigs 
of 
his 
dayfor 
depressing 
its 
interests 
in 
favour 
of 
commerce, 
the 
supposed 
backbone 
of 
their 
political 
party. 
He 
was 
remarkably 
alive 
to 
questions 
of 
finance 
and 
taxation; 
he 
carefully 
watched 
the 
beginnings 
of 
a 
system 
of 
insurances, 
and 
was 
intent 
upon 
measures 
for 
improving 
the 
sanitary 
condition 
of 
the 
people, 
and 
protecting 
it 
against 
the 
spread 
of 
infectious 
diseases, 
even 
where 
their 
cure 
was 
an 
unsolved 
problem. 
In 
reading 
some 
of 
the 
political 
pamphlets 
on 
which 
I 
am 
about 
to 
touch 
and 
which 
turn 
on 
the 
successful 
conduct 
of 
wars, 
I 
have 
been 
repeatedly 
struck 
with 
the 
attention 
he 
gives 
to 
the 
health 
of 
armies 
and 
to 
the 
sufficiency 
of 
the 
commissariat 
on 
which 
it 
so 
largely 
depends 
as 
important 
elements 
in 
their 
effectiveness. 
I 
need 
hardly 
say 
that 
education 
was 
a 
theme 
very 
near 
to 
his 
heart, 
and 
that 
in 
two 
directions 
in 
particular 
his 
farsightedness 
asserted 
itself 
in 
this 
field 
in 
an 
extraordinary 
degree. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
he 
perceived 
the 
place 
which, 
to 
translate 
his 
speculations 
into 
the 
language 
of 
the 
present 
day, 
science 
would 
come 
to 
occupy 
by 
the 
side 
of 
the 
other 
studies. 
Humanism, 
he 
was 
convinced, 
had 
no 
prescriptive 
right 
to 
rule 
the 
progress 
of 
human 
culture 
any 
more 
than 
the 
scholasticism 
which 
it 
had 
superseded. 
And 
we 
humanists 
of 
a 
later 
age, 
who 
have 
learnt 
to 
ignore 
the 
old 
bugbear 
at 
which 
during 
the 
better 
part 
of 
our 
lives, 
north 
or 
south, 
we 



have 
been 
constantly 
told 
to 
tremble 
the 
fear 
of 
the 
classics 
being 
driven 
to 
the 
wall 
may 
accept 
quite 
cheerfully 
the 
sort 
of 
apologue 
which 
I 
find 
in 
a 
passage 
of 
a 
letter 
from 
Leibniz 
to 
Thomas 
Burnet: 
“I 
do 
not 
for 
a 
moment 
envy 
the 
excellent 
Mr. 
Dryden” 
— 
it 
seems 
to 
bring 
two 
epochs 
of 
Western 
intellectual 
life 
rather 
closely 
together 
to 
find 
Leibniz 
writing 
about 
Dryden 
as 
a 
contemporary— 
“because 
his 
Virgil 
has 
put 
more 
than 
£1,000 
into 
his 
pocket. 
But 
I 
wish 
that 
Mr. 
Halley 
could 
secure 
the 
same 
sum 
at 
least 
four 
times 
over 
so 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
travel 
round 
the 
world 
and 
discover 
for 
us 
the 
secret 
of 
the 
variation 
of 
the 
compass, 
and 
I 
wish 
that 
Mr. 
Newton 
could 
obtain 
it 
tenfold 
and 
a 
good 
deal 
over, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
continue 
his 
profound 
meditations 
without 
interruption.” 
You 
see 
how 
Leibniz 
thought 
of 
the 
endowment 
of 
research; 
and, 
if 
his 
indefatigable 
exertions 
at 
Vienna, 
at 
Berlin, 
and 
elsewhere 
in 
favour 
of 
those 
Academies 
and 
Societies 
whose 
true 
purpose 
is 
the 
promotion 
viribus 
unitis 
of 
great 
researches 
in 
the 
whole 
boundless 
realm 
of 
human 
knowledge 
be 
taken 
into 
account, 
I 
should 
be 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
say 
what 
other 
individual 
has 
ever 
equalled 
him 
in 
advancing 
the 
highest 
of 
all 
forms 
of 
educational 
work. 
One 
cannot 
but 
speculate 
on 
the 
satisfaction 
with 
which 
he 
would 
have 
regarded 
such 
conceptions 
on 
the 
value 
of 
organised 
University 
research 
as 
have 
lately 
been 
brought 
to 
the 
eve 
of 
practical 
realisation 
at 
Berlin, 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
centenary 
of 
its 
great 
University 
—aninstitutionwhich 
hemayalmost 
besaidtohaveforeseen. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
showed 
himself 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
signficance 
of 
literary 
expression 
as 
one 
of 
the 
chief 
agencies 
by 
which 
national 
self-
knowledge 
and 
national 
self-reliance 
are 
trained 
and 
matured. 
He 
perceived 
that 
the 
vernacular 
(what 
an 
unfortunate 
term! 
let 
me 
say, 
the 
mother-tongue) 
is 
the 
instrument 
with 
which 
Providence 
has 
supplied 
a 
nation 
resolved 
on 
havingandholdingthesepossessions;and,afew 
years 
beforethefoundationdeed 
of 
the 
Berlin 
Academy 
declared 
the 
preservation 
and 
the 
study 
of 
the 



German 
language 
to 
be 
one 
of 
its 
chief 
tasks, 
Leibniz 
had 
promulgated 
the 
principles 
then 
first 
officially 
approved. 
And, 
if 
the 
style 
of 
his 
numerous 
German 
compositions 
in 
prose 
and 
in 
verse 
still 
offers 
an 
unmistakable 
and 
at 
times 
uncomfortable 
contrast 
to 
the 
care 
and 
elegance 
of 
his 
Latin 
and 
his 
French, 
he 
never 
shrank 
from 
using 
his 
native 
tongue 
unless 
occasion 
demanded 
more 
cosmopolitan 
speech. 
So 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
his 
communications 
to 
the 
Emperor 
were 
all 
in 
German; 
nor 
had 
he 
for 
gotten 
Luther 
s 
principle 
ofplainspeech 
for 
plain 
folk. 


You 
may 
think 
that 
I 
am 
losing 
my 
way 
before 
I 
have 
reached 
the 
threshold 
which 
I 
have 
invited 
you 
to 
cross 
with 
me, 
and 
I 
will 
therefore 
say 
nothing 
of 
Leibniz 
s 
labours 
for 
the 
communication 
of 
the 
results 
of 
research 
as 
well 
as 
for 
its 
prosecution, 
nor 
ask 
you 
to 
consider 
his 
claims 
to 
the 
title 
of 
the 
originator 
of 
the 
modern 
encyclopaedia. 
But 
there 
is 
a 
different 
instance 
of 
his 
constructive 
efforts 
as 
a 
man 
of 
action 
which 
I 
cannot 
pass 
by 
not 
only 
because 
it 
completely 
harmonises 
with 
his 
endeavours 
as 
a 
politician, 
but 
because 
at 
times 
it 
intimately 
associates 
itself 
with, 
and 
almost 
forms 
part 
of 
them. 
For 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
whatever 
that 
the 
religious 
question 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
vital 
element 
in 
European 
politics, 
and 
in 
those 
of 
the 
Empire 
in 
particular, 
long 
after 
the 
conflicts 
which 
culminated 
in 
the 
Thirty 
Years 
Warhad 
nominally 
cometoanend. 


The 
efforts, 
then, 
of 
Leibniz 
for 
Religious 
Reunion, 
i.e. 
for 
a 
formal 
closing 
of 
the 
great 
schism 
of 
the 
West 
by 
means 
of 
a 
reconciliation 
between 
Rome 
and 
the 
Protestant 
Churches, 
were 
among 
those 
of 
his 
labours 
which 
were 
doomed 
to 
disappointment 
whether, 
like 
certain 
others 
on 
which 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
touch, 
to 
absolute 
failure, 
is 
more 
than 
those 
of 
us 
can 
pronounce 
who 
lack 
the 
gift 
of 
prophecy. 
How 
unwearying 
those 
labours 
were 
in 
the 
present 
instance 
is 
known 
to 
us 
not 
only 
from 
the 
arguments 
carried 
on 
by 
him 
alike 
with 
the 
protagonists 
in 
a 
discussion 
which 
lasted 



over 
the 
better 
part 
of 
a 
human 
generation, 
from 
the 
Eagle 
of 
Meaux 
downwards, 
and 
with 
the 
parliament 
of 
lesser 
participants 
— 
ecclesiastics 
and 
doctors 
and 
more 
or 
less 
enthusiastic 
women. 
We 
also 
know 
it 
from 
at 
least 
two 
long 
correspondences 
of 
which 
one 
is 
familiar 
to 
all 
who 
are 
interested 
in 
the 
life 
and 
labours 
of 
Leibniz, 
while 
of 
both 
this 
subject 
of 
Religious 
Reunion 
forms 
a 
constant 
theme. 
The 
letters 
exchanged 
between 
Leibniz 
and 
the 
Duchess, 
afterwards 
Electress, 
Sophia 
of 
Hanover 
are, 
as 
you 
know, 
of 
great 
biographical 
interest, 
so 
far 
as 
the 
life 
and 
opinions 
of 
an 
illustrious 
lady 
fit 
ancestress 
of 
a 
long 
line 
of 
English 
sovereigns 
are 
concerned. 
Gifted 
with 
extraordinary 
acuteness 
of 
perception 
and 
a 
lively 
interest 
in 
things 
intellectual, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
perfectly 
self-possessed 
and 
when 
needful 
self-restrained 
in 
the 
difficulties 
of 
life 
and 
hers 
seemed 
almost 
endless 
in 
maidenhood, 
marriage, 
and 
old 
age 
she, 
unlike 
her 
quondam 
quasi 
suitor, 
afterwards 
King 
Charles 
II, 
seems 
while 
saying 
many 
witty 
things, 
never 
to 
have 
done 
an 
unwise 
one. 
What 
is 
of 
more 
importance, 
her 
opinions, 
so 
far 
as 
we 
can 
judge 
from 
a 
series 
of 
personal 
records 
quite 
exceptionally 
full 
and 
varied, 
were 
rarely 
on 
any 
side 
but 
that 
of 
good 
sense 
and 
right 
feeling. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
as 
Leibniz 
very 
well 
knew, 
even 
matters 
in 
which 
she 
felt 
an 
interest 
had 
to 
be 
presented 
to 
her 
in 
lucid 
and 
attractive 
form; 
she 
was 
a 
princess 
first, 
after 
all, 
and 
not 
a 
philosopher, 
like 
her 
aunt 
the 
Princess 
Palatine 
Elizabeth, 
with 
whom 
Descartes 
had 
corresponded 
on 
scientific 
topics 
as 
with 
an 
equal; 
nor 
did 
she 
profess 
to 
care 
for 
what 
was 
lengthy 
or 
intricate, 
or 
involved 
an 
unreasonable 
amount 
of 
application 
in 
the 
mastering 
of 
it. 
Religious 
questions 
she 
approached, 
like 
all 
other 
questions, 
with 
a 
sincere 
love 
of 
truth, 
but 
with 
a 
want 
of 
interest 
in 
theological 
issues 
and 
formulae 
partly 
due 
to 
the 
natural 
constitution 
of 
her 
mind, 
partly 
(one 
cannot 
but 
conjecture) 
to 
the 
experiences 
of 
her 
life, 
which 
had 
been 
so 
full 
of 
these 



contentions 
and 
of 
their 
untoward 
effects 
upon 
the 
problem 
of 
getting 
on 
in 
theworld 
astobreedin 
heragooddealofindifferencetowards

The 
other 
correspondent 
to 
whom 
Leibniz 
had 
as 
it 
were 
to 
render 
a 
continuous 
account 
of 
the 
progress 
of 
his 
endeavours 
in 
the 
Reunion 
question 
was 
a 
spirit 
of 
another 
sort. 
Landgrave 
Ernest 
of 
Hesse-Rheinfels 
was 
one 
of 
the 
younger 
sons 
of 
Landgrave 
Maurice 
of 
HesseCassel, 
the 
political 
associate 
of 
the 
French 
King 
Henry 
IV 
and 
of 
Geneva, 
whose 
edifice 
of 
a 
Protestant 
polity, 
constructed 
with 
infinite 
trouble, 
had 
been 
ruthlessly 
swept 
away 
early 
in 
the 
Thirty 
Years 
War, 
and 
whose 
dynasty 
was 
only 
by 
the 
most 
careful 
steering 
brought 
safe 
out 
of 
the 
waves 
of 
that 
ruinous 
conflict. 
After 
its 
close 
Landgrave 
Ernest, 
although 
he 
had 
gallantly 
come 
forward 
to 
offer 
the 
services 
of 
his 
sword 
to 
the 
Emperor 
against 
the 
Turks, 
soon 
gave 
himself 
up 
to 
his 
endeavours 
to 
keep 
up 
a 
petty 
principality 
of 
his 
own 
on 
the 
Rhine, 
and 
to 
have 
his 
own 
way 
in 
it. 
He 
had 
become 
a 
convert 
to 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome, 
and 
being 
anxious 
to 
induce 
others 
to 
follow 
his 
example, 
carried 
on 
his 
propaganda 
by 
all 
the 
means 
in 
his 
power, 
publishing 
a 
treatise 
called 
The 
Discreet 
Catholic, 
and, 
with 
less 
discretion 
than 
might 
have 
been 
expected 
from 
its 
author, 
establishing 
at 
Rheinfels 
a 
sort 
of 
college 
for 
ladies 
of 
whom 
several 
were 
converts 
like 
himself, 
and 
for 
whom, 
in 
spite 
of 
his 
sceptical 
kinsfolk, 
he 
cherished 
a 
platonic 
interest. 
He 
made 
no 
secret 
to 
Leibniz 
of 
his 
wish 
that, 
as 
they 
shared 
in 
many 
common 
interests, 
so 
they 
might 
be 
united 
in 
the 
same 
church; 
but, 
since 
this 
could 
not 
be, 
he 
was 
content 
to 
discuss 
projects 
of 
Reunion, 
though 
he 
thought 
that 
Pietists 
and 
Chiliasts 
and 
other 
visionaries, 
as 
he 
called 
them 
(including 
no 
less 
a 
name 
than 
that 
of 
Spener 
in 
hisdenunciation), 
mustbelookedupon 
asobstaclesin 
the 
path. 


The 
toleration 
which 
is, 
in 
some 
measure 
at 
least, 
the 
product 
of 
indifference, 
and 
the 
intolerance 
which 
springs 
from 
impatience 
of 
all 
private 
judgment 
but 
one’s 
own 
— 
neither 
of 
these 
was 
an 
ally 
on 
whom 
Leibniz 



could 
greatly 
depend 
in 
his 
long-sustained 
effort 
to 
assert 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
reunion 
the 
existing 
inner 
unity 
of 
the 
Christian 
Church 
at 
large. 
For 
this, 
the 
in 
essentialibus 
unitas 
of 
St. 
Augustine, 
was 
the 
principle 
which 
he 
continued 
to 
press 
in 
both 
the 
chief 
phases 
of 
the 
movement 
in 
which 
he 
bore 
a 
part. 
The 
more 
hopeful 
of 
these, 
which 
extended 
over 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
the 
17th 
century, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
last 
five 
years, 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
correspondence 
(included 
in 
that 
between 
the 
Duchess 
Sophia 
and 
Leibniz), 
of 
which 
the 
central 
figure 
is 
Royas 
de 
Spinola, 
Bishop 
of 
Tina 
in 
Croatia, 
and 
afterwards 
of 
Wiener-Neustadt. 
This 
prelate 
had 
the 
full 
authority 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Leopold 
in 
carrying 
on 
his 
endeavours, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
tacit 
approval 
of 
Pope 
Innocent 
XI. 
Leibniz, 
who 
had 
not 
taken 
the 
initiative 
in 
the 
Bishop 
s 
scheme, 
warmly 
approved 
of 
his 
method, 
which 
was 
neither 
that 
of 
discussion 
nor 
that 
of 
concession. 
The 
inefficiency 
of 
the 
former 
is 
sufficiently 
taught 
by 
history, 
and 
some 
of 
us 
may 
remember 
one 
of 
the 
essays 
of 
Clarendon 
(certainly 
no 
reunionist) 
in 
which 
he 
blandly 
asserts 
the 
uselessness 
of 
religious 
conferences 
between 
Roman 
Catholics 
and 
Reformed, 
inasmuch 
as 
they 
never 
converted 
a 
single 
human 
being: 
those 
who 
are 
converted 
are 
not 
converted 
by 
argument. 
In 
concession 
(condescendance) 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
thereisalways 
something 
that 
cannot 
be 
conceded; 
Leibniz 
himself 
had 
told 
the 
Landgrave 
that 
he 
would 
join 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 
if 
he 
did 
not 
feel 
that 
certain 
tenets 
which 
he 
must 
reserve 
would, 
“ 
peut-être,” 
not 
be 
conceded, 
and 
he 
could 
not 
risk 
the 
peut-être. 
What 
then 
was 
Bishop 
Spinola’s 
method? 
To 
induce 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 
to 
regardas 
not 
absolutelyalienated 
fromthe 
Church 
thosewho,while 
material, 


i.e. 
nominal, 
heretics, 
were 
ready 
to 
submit 
to 
a 
Council 
of 
the 
Church 
recognised 
by 
them 
as 
such, 
and 
to 
induce 
the 
Protestants 
for 
their 
part 
to 
declare 
that 
readiness. 
You 
will 
perceive 
at 
once 
how 
this 
method 
carries 
us 
back 
to 
days 
when 
resort 
to 
it 
was 
still 
formally 
possible. 
Was 
it 
possible 
to 

revive 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
times 
of 
Charles 
V 
in 
the 
age 
of 
Leopold 
I 
and 
Louis 
XIV? 
Of 
course 
the 
application 
of 
the 
method 
involved 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
tentative 
discussion 
as 
to 
the 
questions 
of 
major 
and 
of 
minor 
moment 
which 
would 
have 
to 
be 
reserved 
or 
waived, 
were 
such 
a 
basis 
of 
negotiation 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
within 
the 
sphere 
of 
practical 
politics; 
and 
on 
this 
head 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
observe 
without 
interest 
some 
of 
us 
might 
add 
without 
sympathy 
which 
among 
the 
controversies 
of 
lesser 
moment 
Leibniz 
regards 
as 
mere 
matters 
of 
phrase 
and 
formula; 
while 
as 
to 
others 
he 
shows 
how 
not 
even 
all 
Catholics 
and 
all 
Protestants 
are 
agreed 
among 
themselves, 
and 
yet 
others 
seem 
to 
him 
to 
possess 
intrinsic 
importance, 
but 
not 
such 
as 
to 
outweightheblessings 
ofChristianreunion. 


Louis 
XIV, 
at 
least, 
did 
not 
choose 
to 
fall 
behind 
Leopold 
I 
by 
rejecting 
as 
impossible 
a 
contingency 
against 
which, 
by 
his 
approval 
of 
the 
Bishop 
of 
Tina’s 
initial 
proceedings, 
the 
Emperor 
had 
shown 
himself 
unwilling 
to 
shut 
the 
door. 
When, 
therefore, 
the 
Duchess 
Sophia 
put 
herself 
in 
communication 
on 
the 
subject 
with 
her 
sister, 
that 
queer 
saint 
the 
Abbess 
of 
Maubuisson 
near 
Paris, 
it 
was 
with 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
King 
of 
France 
that 
other 
persons 
were 
drawn 
into 
the 
correspondence, 
and 
that 
an 
exchange 
of 
letters 
ensued 
between 
Leibniz 
and 
Bossuet 
which, 
after 
being 
carried 
on 
for 
about 
four 
years, 
was 
dropped 
and 
again 
taken 
up 
for 
a 
short 
time 
in 
1699, 
partly 
with 
theaidoftheenthusiasmofMme. 
deBrinon. 


The 
earlier 
part 
of 
this 
correspondence 
was 
really 
little 
more 
than 
a 
continuous 
account 
rendered 
by 
Leibniz 
to 
Bossuet 
of 
the 
proceedings 
of 
Spinola, 
supplemented 
by 
arguments 
of 
his 
own; 
when, 
after 
Spinola’s 
death, 
it 
was 
taken 
up 
once 
more, 
Leibniz 
explained 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
Elector, 
George 
Lewis 
(afterwards 
King 
George 
I), 
why 
this 
last 
opportunity 
should 
in 
his 
judgment 
not 
be 
rejected. 
His 
hopes 
were 
small, 
but 
it 
was 
well 
to 
do 
so 
much 
for 
Christian 
charity, 
and 
if 
possible 
to 
induce 
the 
Church 
of 
Rome 



or 
some 
representative 
Roman 
theologians, 
to 
agree 
to 
a 
basis 
on 
which 
posteritymightconstructthemost 
acceptableschemeofreunionthatcould 
be 
agreed 
upon, 
and 
which 
would 
anticipate 
future 
attempts 
at 
reunions 
in 
which 
everything 
would 
be 
sacrificed. 
The 
hope, 
as 
we 
know, 
was 
futile; 
the 
political 
horizon, 
which 
had 
in 
a 
measure 
cleared 
with 
the 
Peace 
of 
Ryswick, 
was 
soonblackerthanever;aclauseofthatpeaceitselfhad 
seriouslyalarmed 
German 
Protestants; 
and 
at 
home 
and 
at 
the 
last 
period 
of 
the 
religious 
policy 
of 
Louis 
XIV 
was 
that 
of 
the 
undisputed 
ascendancy 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
Madamede 
Maintenon. 


It 
would, 
I 
fear, 
take 
me 
too 
far 
on 
the 
present 
occasion, 
were 
I 
to 
seek 
to 
illustrate 
with 
any 
degree 
of 
detail 
the 
connexion 
between 
the 
religious 
and 
the 
political 
conceptions 
of 
Leibniz; 
and 
it 
is 
to 
his 
work 
as 
a 
politician 
proper 
that 
I 
now 
turn. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
to 
cover 
the 
whole 
of 
his 
life 
from 
the 
time 
when, 
after 
being 
refused 
the 
doctorate 
of 
law 
by 
the 
University 
of 
his 
own 
native 
Leipzig 
on 
account 
of 
his 
youth 
(he 
was 
then 
twenty 
years 
of 
age), 
he 
had 
been 
promoted 
to 
this 
degree 
at 
Altdorf, 
but, 
declining 
the 
professorship 
offered 
him 
there, 
had 
entered 
the 
service 
of 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mainz. 
From 
this 
time 
forth 
he 
became 
a 
courtier 
and 
a 
placeman, 
but 
without 
ever 
surrendering 
his 
independence 
of 
judgment 
or 
doing 
violence 
to 
his 
sense 
of 
self-respect. 
He 
was 
only 
too 
well 
aware 
of 
the 
prejudice 
existing 
in 
the 
official 
world 
against 
taking 
the 
advice 
of 
scholars 
and 
bookmen; 
when 
in 
laterdayshe 
seemedon 
the 
point 
of 
permanently 
enteringintothe 
Imperial 
service 
at 
Vienna, 
he 
was 
anxious 
to 
do 
so 
in 
the 
recognised 
position 
of 
a 
councillor 
of 
state 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
a 
librarian. 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
position 
of 
an 
official 
and 
that 
of 
an 
unofficial 
adviser 
was 
to 
be 
brought 
home 
to 
him 
with 
painful 
distinctness, 
when, 
after 
the 
death 
of 
the 
Electress 
Sophia, 
the 
‘Master’ 
(as 
withher 
usualhumorous 
twinkleshe 
was 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
calling 
her 
eldest 
son, 
whose 
qualities 
certainly 
included 
that 
of 
knowing 



his 
own 
mind) 
speedily 
adjusted 
the 
relations 
between 
himself 
and 
Leibniz 
to 
those 
between 
employer 
and 
employed. 
But, 
though 
Leibniz 
was 
a 
courtier 
and 
very 
well 
understood 
the 
necessity 
for 
a 
deferential 
attitude 
and 
the 
nuances 
of 
expression 
in 
writing 
as 
well 
as 
in 
speaking 
which 
that 
attitude 
implies, 
no 
great 
publicist, 
from 
Burke 
to 
Gentz 
to 
the 
leaders 
of 
modern 
journalism 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Louis-Philippe 
and 
Queen 
Victoria, 
has 
ever 
been 
more 
desirous 
of 
placing 
himself 
in 
touch 
with 
a 
popular, 
and, 
if 
possible, 
a 
numerous 
audience. 
Accordingly, 
the 
political 
writings 
of 
Leibniz 
are 
sometimes 
confidential 
memoranda, 
addressed 
to 
sovereigns 
and 
ministers, 
sometimes 
pamphlets 
in 
the 
latter 
case 
almost 
always 
anonymous 
or 
pseudonymous, 
launched 
upon 
the 
sea 
of 
unbounded 
publicity. 
In 
yet 
other 
instances, 
they 
are 
something 
between 
the 
two 
species, 
resembling 
those 
ballons 
d’essai 
of 
which 
later 
examples 
have 
been 
started 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
higher 
journalism 
— 
sometimes 
suggesting 
to 
those 
in 
authority 
ideas 
to 
the 
conception 
of 
which 
they 
may 
not 
have 
chanced 
or 
not 
have 
ventured 
to 
rise, 
sometimes, 
again, 
inspired 
by 
those 
in 
authority 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ascertain 
how 
far 
public 
opinion 
will 
follow. 
This 
relation 
between 
authority 
and 
public 
opinion 
was 
not 
so 
well 
organised 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
and 
beginning 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century 
as 
it 
may 
have 
been 
in 
our 
days; 
but 
statesmen 
have 
never 
been 
able 
to 
operate 
quite 
without 
the 
support 
of 
public 
opinion 
— 
and 
public 
opinion, 
in 
its 
turn, 
usually 
needs 
a 
little 
assistance 
in 
the 
process 
of 
forming 
itself. 
Leibniz 
himself 
compares 
one 
of 
his 
more 
popular 
tracts 
a 
scheme 
for 
a 
descent 
on

It 
would 
serve 
no 
purpose 
in 
this 
brief 
address 
to 
seek 
to 
discriminate 
between 
the 
varieties 
among 
his 
contributions 
to 
political 
literature, 
of 
which 



I 
can 
only 
mention 
a 
few 
specimens. 
For 
my 
primary 
object 
is 
to 
indicate 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
great 
optimist, 
the 
thinker 
who 
was 
convinced 
that 
in 
the 
end 
all 
things 
would 
work 
together 
to 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
Divine 
plan, 
regarded 
some 
of 
the 
chief 
political 
problems 
of 
his 
age 
and 
was 
anxious 
to 
see 
them 
treated 
by 
those 
upon 
whose 
action 
or 
inaction 
it 
depended 
in 
what 
sensetheywouldbesolved. 


Leibniz 
was 
only 
in 
his 
twenty-third 
year 
when, 
in 
1667, 
he 
was 
introduced 
into 
the 
service 
of 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mainz 
(John 
Philip 
von 
Schönborn) 
by 
the 
Elector 
s 
former 
minister, 
Johann 
Christian 
von 
Boineburg. 
Both 
these 
men 
were 
very 
remarkable 
personalities 
and 
must 
be 
reckoned 
not 
only 
among 
the 
ablest 
German 
politicians 
of 
their 
day 
but 
as 
belonging 
to 
the 
select 
band 
of 
statesmen 
who 
were 
true 
patriots 
at 
heart. 
Yet 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Elector 
is 
associated 
in 
history 
with 
the 
first 
Confederation 
of 
the 
Rhine 
— 
a 
transaction 
which, 
when 
all 
has 
been 
said 
that 
can 
be 
urged 
as 
to 
its 
ultimate 
purposes, 
nevertheless 
redounded 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
France 
and 
to 
the 
increase 
of 
her 
influence 
in 
Germany. 
Boineburg, 
after, 
as 
minister 
of 
the 
Elector, 
openly 
declaring 
himself 
an 
adversary 
of 
that 
influence, 
had 
through 
French 
intrigue, 
facilitated 
perhaps 
by 
some 
indiscretion 
on 
his 
own 
part, 
been 
actually 
put 
under 
arrest 
by 
his 
master; 
and, 
though, 
on 
his 
clearing 
himself 
from 
the 
charges 
against 
him, 
John 
Philip 
had 
entreated 
him 
to 
resume 
his 
former 
post, 
he 
had 
preferred 
to 
remain 
out 
of 
office, 
while 
in 
full 
possession 
of 
the 
electoral 
favour 
and 
confidence. 
The 
political 
ideas 
of 
the 
pair 
were 
really 
in 
harmony 
and 
centred 
in 
the 
desire, 
while 
strengthening 
the 
Empire 
internally, 
to 
maintain 
in 
European 
affairs 
a 
balance 
between 
France 
and 
Austria, 
and 
to 
preserve 
the 
peace 
which 
was 
indispensable 
for 
Germany. 
The 
material 
ruin 
in 
which 
the 
Thirty 
Years 
War 
had 
involved 
the 
land 
(for 
I 
think 
we 
may 
confidently 
reject 
the 
doubts 
which 
have 
been 
recently 
thrown 
on 
this 
commonly 
received 
view 
of 
the 
case) 
still 
stared 
every 
patriot 
in 
the 



face, 
and 
was 
only 
here 
and 
there 
at 
last 
giving 
way 
to 
better 
things. 
‘Germany,’ 
so 
Leibniz 
wrote 
many 
years 
after 
John 
Philip 
s 
death, 
was 
scarcely 
beginning 
to 
breathe 
again, 
and 
peopled 
almost 
entirely 
by 
a 
generation 
underageif 
warbrokeoutafresh, 
there 
wasreason 
tofearthatthis 
generation 
would 
be 
destroyed 
before 
it 
had 
reached 
maturity, 
and 
that 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
unhappy 
land 
would 
be 
all 
but 
turned 
into 
a 
desert.” 
These 
were 
the 
impressions 
under 
which 
a 
policy 
of 
peace 
seemed 
indispensable 
to 
the 
patriotic 
Elector 
of 
Mainz, 
who, 
as 
Leibniz 
says, 
could 
not 
conceive 
that 
thepredominanceofFrancewouldassertitselfwiththeextraordinaryrapidity 
which 
its 
progress 
was 
actually 
to 
display; 
these 
were 
the 
conditions 
with 
which, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
stagnant 
sluggishness 
prevailing 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
the 
Empire 
and 
with 
the 
mistrust 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Austria 
which 
war 
and 
peace 
had 
alike 
bequeathed 
to 
many 
of 
its 
Princes 
and 
their 
subjects, 
those 
politicians 
and 
political 
thinkers 
had 
to 
contend 
who, 
like 
Leibniz, 
gradually 
came 
to 
recognise 
that 
the 
Western 
was 
not 
less 
imminent 
than 
the 
Eastern 
peril. 


Leibniz’ 
earliest 
political 
tract 
was 
written 
for 
the 
use 
of 
Boineburg, 
when, 
after 
his 
restoration 
to 
the 
Elector 
s 
favour, 
that 
statesman 
in 
1668 
attended 
the 
Polish 
election 
diet 
as 
ambassador 
for 
the 
German 
candidate 
(Count 
Palatine 
Philip 
William 
of 
Neuburg). 
Neither 
he 
nor 
either 
of 
the 
candidates 
really 
favoured 
by 
France 
and 
Austria 
respectively 
was 
chosen; 
and 
thus, 
after 
a 
fashion, 
the 
desired 
balance 
may 
be 
said 
to 
have 
been 
observed. 
What 
interests 
us 
in 
the 
tract 
is 
Leibniz 
deprecation 
of 
yet 
another 
possibility 
(which 
likewise 
remained 
unrealised), 
viz. 
the 
choice 
of 
the 
Russian 
candidate. 
Russia, 
writes 
the 
far-sighted 
young 
politician, 
who 
in 
his 
later 
yearswastobe 
greatly 
attractedby 
thecivilising 
policy 
andthe 
high 
personal 
intelligence 
of 
Peter 
the 
Great, 
would 
by 
the 
virtual 
appropriation 
of 
Poland 



become 
a 
dangerous 
colossus, 
and 
the 
Turk 
would 
be 
duplicated. 
But 
these 
wererelativelyremotespeculations. 


In 
his 
second 
pamphlet, 
and 
one 
which 
its 
comprehensiveness 
of 
view 
already 
entitles 
to 
be 
numbered 
among 
the 
notable 
political 
deliverances 
of 
its 
author, 
his 
thoughts 
are 
already 
directly 
turned 
to 
the 
West. 
The 
Confederationofthe 
Rhine 
had 
fallen 
to 
pieces, 
and 
theeyes 
of 
theElector 
of 
Mainz, 
with 
Boineburg 
once 
more 
in 
his 
secrets, 
had 
been 
opened 
by 
the 
War 
of 
Devolution 
to 
the 
aggressive 
policy 
of 
Louis 
XIV. 
But 
the 
Elector 
and 
those 
who 
thought 
with 
him 
were 
not 
yet 
willing 
to 
hurry 
Germany 
into 
a 
decision 
which 
might 
be 
fatal 
to 
her 
prosperity, 
unprepared 
as 
she 
was 
for 
a 
struggle; 
and 
the 
choice 
therefore 
had 
lain 
for 
some 
little 
time 
between 
risking 
all 
by 
joining 
the 
celebrated 
— 
perhaps 
unduly 
celebrated 
— 
Triple 
Alliance 
which 
had 
in 
a 
measure 
stayed 
the 
advance 
of 
the 
French 
arms, 
or 
playing 
a 
waiting 
game, 
and 
meanwhile 
organising 
resistance 
at 
home. 
Securitas 
Publica 
(the 
way 
of 
establishing 
the 
security 
of 
the 
German 
Empire) 
as 
the 
title 
of 
the 
treatise 
is 
usually 
cited 
in 
brief 
— 
was 
written 
in 
1670–1 
— 
between 
two 
wars; 
and 
its 
immediate 
occasion 
was 
to 
provide 
a 
basis 
of 
discussion 
at 
an 
interview 
between 
the 
Electors 
of 
Mainz 
and 
Trier 
at 
Schwalbach, 
where 
they 
were 
to 
decide 
on 
the 
policy 
to 
be 
adopted 
by 
them 
and 
the 
Duke 
of 
Lorraine, 
with 
whom 
they 
had 
combined 
in 
the 
so-called 
alliance 
of 
Limburg, 
and 
who 
was 
now 
trembling 
how 
to 
save 
his 
duchy 
from 
the 
embraces 
of 
France. 
While 
Leibniz 
was 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
his 
disquisition, 
Marshal 
Crequi 
had 
overrun 
Lorraine 
and 
strengthened 
the 
writer 
s 
argument. 
In 
a 
very 
interesting 
survey 
of 
the 
chief 
states 
of 
Europe 
and 
of 
their 
relations 
to 
France, 
he 
demonstrates 
how 
the 
conclusion 
is 
inevitable 
that 
Louis 
XIV 
has 
a 
design 
upon 
the 
United 
Provinces; 
but 
that 
to 
join 
the 
Triple 
Alliance 
and 
enter 
upon 
immediate 
war 
would 
be 
perdition 
for 
Germany 
and 
more 
especially 
for 
the 
defenceless 
states 
of 
the 
South 
West. 
Better 
form 
an 



alliance 
between 
these 
German 
States 
of 
the 
West, 
which 
could 
for 
the 
present 
give 
no 
offence 
to 
France; 
but 
without 
including 
her 
as 
a 
predominant 
partner, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Confederation 
of 
the 
Rhine, 
and 
thus 
gradually 
prepare 
for 
the 
conflict 
which 
must 
come 
sooner 
or 
later, 
but 
the 
later 
the 
better. 


Both 
the 
negative 
and 
the 
positive 
part 
of 
the 
advice 
was 
followed; 
the 
Triple 
Alliance 
was 
left 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
itself 
Leibniz 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Charles 
II’s 
Secret 
Treaty 
of 
Dover 
(1670) 
with 
Louis 
XIV 
had 
already 
destroyed 
this 
diplomatic 
masterpiece; 
and 
an 
alliance 
of 
German 
States 
was 
formed 
at 
Marienburg, 
which 
with 
excellent 
intentions 
proved 
a 
dead 
letter. 
The 
invasion 
of 
the 
United 
Provinces 
by 
France, 
with 
England 
on 
her 
side, 
became 
more 
imminent 
than 
ever, 
and 
a 
European 
war, 
in 
which 
(as 
events 
proved) 
the 
Emperor 
could 
not 
remain 
neutral 
even 
if 
he 
would, 
must 
almost 
inevitably 
follow. 
Was 
Germany, 
like 
Holland, 
to 
fall 
helpless 
into 
the 
victor’shands?Ormighttheblow,ifitcouldnotbemet,bediverted? 


This 
calculation, 
rather 
than 
a 
dream 
of 
bringing 
the 
kingdom 
of 
the 
Pharaohs 
within 
the 
range 
of 
the 
Western 
civilisation 
which 
owed 
an 
ancient 
debt 
to 
that 
mysterious 
land, 
was, 
it 
cannot 
be 
doubted, 
the 
real 
raison 
d’être 
of 
Leibniz’ 
famous 
‘Egyptian 
plan.’ 
Far 
from 
being 
a 
mere 
scholar’s 
fancy, 
this 
design 
had 
in 
germ 
long 
impregnated 
the 
political 
atmosphere 
of 
the 
West, 
allying 
itself 
with 
the 
lingering 
enthusiasms 
of 
the 
Crusades, 
and 
with 
the 
desire 
for 
a 
condign 
revanche 
which 
the 
failure 
of 
St. 
Louis 
had 
every 
now 
and 
then 
called 
forth 
inthe 
sons 
of 
France. 
Bacon, 
whose 
influenceupon 
Leibniz 
was 
probably 
far 
greater 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
political 
and 
social 
projects 
than 
it 
was 
in 
philosophy, 
had, 
in 
the 
dedication 
to 
his 
Holy 
Warre 
suggested 
that 
the 
princes 
of 
Christendom 
should 
unite 
against 
the 
Turk 
instead 
of 
inflicting 
damage 
upon 
one 
another. 
This 
was 
shortly 
after 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Thirty 
Years 
War; 
thirteen 
years 
after 
its 
close, 
Cardinal 
Mazarin, 



doubtless 
not 
actuated 
altogether 
by 
religious 
motives, 
left 
a 
legacy 
for 
carrying 
on 
a 
war 
against 
the 
Ottoman 
power; 
and, 
after 
the 
accession 
of 
Louis 
XIV, 
Boileau 
and 
Fenelon 
in 
letters, 
and 
others 
in 
apocalyptic 
prophecies, 
appealed 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
to 
the 
receptive 
mind 
of 
the 
King. 
In 
1664, 
French 
troops, 
forming 
a 
contingent 
furnished 
by 
Louis 
XIV 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Confederation 
of 
the 
Rhine, 
took 
part 
in 
Montecuculi’s 
splendid 
victory 
at 
St. 
Gotthard 
on 
the 
Raab 
over 
the 
Grand 
Vizier 
Ahmed 
Köprili, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
year 
the 
French 
flag 
was 
planted 
at 
Gigeri 
on 
the 
Algiers 
coast, 
as 
a 
place 
of 
security 
against 
the 
Moslem 
pirates, 
the 
pest 
of 
theMediterranean. 


It 
is 
unnecessary 
further 
to 
illustrate 
the 
growth 
of 
an 
idea 
which 
took 
hold 
of 
Leibniz 
at 
a 
very 
early 
date, 
and 
which 
no 
doubt 
was 
met 
half-way 
by 
the 
fascination 
which 
the 
rediscovered 
East, 
whether 
Near 
or 
Far, 
always 
exercised 
over 
his 
imagination. 
To 
go 
no 
further 
back, 
towards 
the 
close 
of 
the 
treaties 
mentioned, 
the 
Securitas 
Publica, 
he 
had 
dwelt 
on 
the 
probability 
that 
in 
the 
future, 
when 
the 
scope 
of 
all 
expeditions 
of 
war 
would 
be 
remote, 
France, 
too, 
would 
find 
her 
sphere 
of 
action 
at 
a 
distance, 
and, 
as 
she 
had 
done 
in 
the 
days 
of 
St. 
Louis, 
would 
carry 
the 
arms 
of 
Christendom 
into 
the 
Levant 
and 
into 
Egypt 
in 
particular. 
In 
1671 
— 
only 
a 
few 
months 
before 
Louis 
XIV 
definitely 
announced 
to 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mainz 
his 
intention 
of 
invading 
the 
United 
Provinces 
— 
Leibniz 
composed 
his 
Fabula 
Ludovisia,in 
which 
St. 
Louis 
is 
supposed 
to 
appear 
in 
a 
dream 
to 
his 
reigning 
namesake, 
and 
to 
bid 
him 
undertake 
an 
expedition 
to 
Egypt; 
which 
rather 
sudden 
proposal 
LouisXIV, 
onawaking, 
dutifully 
promises 
to 
carry 
out. 
(Thereisno 
reason 
for 
wondering 
at 
the 
employment 
by 
Leibniz 
of 
this 
or 
similar 
devices 
for 
arresting 
attention 
on 
so 
serious 
a 
subject; 
he 
made 
constant 
use 
of 
them, 
from 
dialogue 
and 
poem 
to 
epigrammatic 
couplet 
and 
even 
mild 
anagram; 
for 
like 
all 
born 
publicists 
may 
I 
say 
all 
born 
teachers 
— 
he 
held 
by 
the 
principle 



of 
repeating 
many 
times, 
if 
possible 
in 
many 
different 
ways, 
the 
one 
thing 
that 
it 
is 
desired 
to 
impress 
on 
readers 
or 
hearers.) 
When, 
in 
the 
same 
year, 
Duke 
John 
Frederick 
of 
Hanover, 
Leibniz 
s 
subsequent 
patron, 
who 
was 
persona 
gratissima 
with 
the 
French 
King 
and 
Court, 
visited 
Mainz, 
Leibniz 
hoped 
for 
a 
personal 
introduction 
through 
him 
to 
the 
great 
monarch, 
and 
it 
was 
afterwards 
intended 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
should 
be 
effected 
by 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mainz, 
to 
whom 
Leibniz 
s 
scheme 
had 
by 
that 
time 
been 
communicated 
by 
Boineburg. 
In 
the 
end, 
however, 
it 
was 
agreed 
to 
send 
a 
general 
statement 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
scheme 
to 
Paris 
beforehand, 
reserving 
its 
details 
for 
the 
present. 
In 
February 
1672, 
Boineburg 
was 
informed 
by 
Pomponne, 
then 
French 
minister 
for 
Foreign 
-Affairs, 
that 
the 
King 
wished 
for 
further 
explanations 
from 
the 
author 
of 
the 
preliminary 
memorandum. 
Thereupon, 
Leibniz 
(taking 
occasion, 
according 
to 
his 
wont, 
to 
combine 
various 
scientific 
projects 
with 
his 
great 
political 
design) 
at 
once 
started 
for 
Paris, 
where 
he 
arrived 
in 
March 
1672. 
In 
the 
same 
month, 
France 
and 
England 
declared 
war 
against 
the 
Dutch, 
and 
in 
two 
months 
time 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
United 
Provinces 
had 
been 
overrun 
by 
the 
French 
forces, 
with 
King 
Louis 
XIV 
at 
their 
head. 
From 
the 
camp 
at 
Doesburg 
Pomponne 
sent 
a 
rather 
nonchalant 
message 
that 
Holy 
Wars 
had 
gone 
out 
of 
fashion; 
and 
it 
might 
have 
been 
supposed 
that 
Leibniz 
at 
Paris 
would 
have 
hereupon 
been 
satisfied 
to 
concentrate 
his 
attention 
upon 
subjects 
of 
common 
interest 
between 
himself 
and 
Antoine 
Arnauld, 
the 
inventor 
of 
the 
pendulum, 
and 
Christian 
Huygens, 
thediscoverer 
ofSaturn’s 
ring. 


Not 
so; 
for, 
though 
the 
Dutch 
War 
had 
not 
been 
averted, 
it 
seemed 
by 
no 
means 
certain 
that 
its 
worst 
apprehended 
consequences 
could 
not 
still 
be 
avoided. 
It 
had 
long 
been 
known 
that 
there 
was 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
diplomatic 
tension 
between 
the 
French 
Government 
and 
the 
Sublime 
Porte; 
and, 
in 
June, 
1672, 
an 
open 
rupture 
occurred 
between 
the 
two 
Governments 
at 
Adrianople, 



and 
people 
in 
France 
began 
to 
talk 
about 
a 
Turkish 
War 
the 
very 
issue 
involved 
in 
Leibniz 
s 
design. 
It 
therefore 
seemed 
after 
all 
well 
worth 
his 
while 
that, 
while 
he 
was 
waiting 
at 
Paris 
with 
more 
or 
less 
hopefulness 
for 
the 
return 
of 
the 
King 
from 
his 
Dutch 
campaign, 
he 
should 
compose 
a 
full 
statement 
of 
his 
design 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
great 
monarch. 
The 
statement 
drawn 
up 
by 
him 
was 
afterwards 
known 
as 
De 
expeditione 
Aegyptiaca 
regi 
Francicz 
proponenda 
Justa 
Dissertatio; 
while 
a 
shorter 
form 
of 
the 
same 
— 
a 
first 
draft, 
or 
more 
probably 
a 
summary 
— 
which 
he 
intended 
for 
Boineburg, 
was 
preservedunderthe 
titleof 
Consilium 
Aegyptiacum. 


My 
account 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
these 
documents 
must 
necessarily 
be 
quite 
brief, 
and 
pretermit 
preamble, 
illustrations 
and 
peroration. 
In 
a 
word, 
then, 
the 
Egyptian 
scheme 
is 
here 
represented 
as 
the 
greatest 
and 
the 
most 
important 
undertaking 
upon 
which 
France 
could 
possibly 
enter; 
for 
its 
accomplishment 
implies 
the 
acquisition 
by 
her 
of 
the 
arbitrium 
of 
the 
known 
world 
and 
the 
military 
leadership 
of 
Christendom. 
It 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
easiest 
and 
the 
least 
dangerous 
of 
great 
designs 
open 
to 
France, 
and 
its 
failure 
would 
not 
be 
fatal 
to 
her. 
Moreover, 
no 
time 
could 
be 
so 
favour 
able 
for 
carrying 
it 
out 
as 
the 
present. 
The 
conquest 
of 
Egypt 
by 
France 
would 
be 
the 
conquest 
of 
the 
Holland 
of 
the 
East, 
and 
would 
at 
the 
same 
time 
bring 
about 
the 
overthrow 
of 
the 
actual 
Holland, 
whose 
strength 
lies 
in 
her 
colonies 
and 
in 
the 
trade 
of 
the 
East 
Indies. 
The 
master 
of 
Egypt 
can 
render 
either 
infinite 
service 
or 
infinite 
disservice 
to 
the 
world 
— 
the 
former 
by 
stopping 
trade 
as 
the 
Turks 
have 
done, 
the 
latter 
by 
developing 
it 
through 
the 
union 
of 
MediterraneanandRedSea 
bymeansof 
acanal. 


Allthiscomeshome;andit 
isalmostby 
way 
of 
a 
parenthesis 
only 
(though 
we 
know 
how 
much 
is 
some 
times 
hidden 
in 
parentheses) 
that 
it 
is 
pointed 
out 
how, 
in 
comparison 
with 
such 
gains 
as 
these, 
the 
conquest 
of 
a 
few 
towns 
on 
the 
Rhine 
or 
in 
the 
Low 
Countries 
is 
worth 
very 
little, 
while, 
moreover, 



the 
kindling 
of 
a 
great 
European 
war 
would 
be 
insensate 
on 
the 
part 
of 
a 
power 
which 
would 
thus 
raise 
resistance 
against 
itself 
on 
all 
sides. 
Contrariwise, 
what 
could 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
of 
the 
two 
great 
imperial 
Houses 
if 
they 
were 
agreed 
on 
dividing 
the 
world 
between 
them 
France 
taking 
the 
Easternhalfof 
the 
whole? 


If 
this 
part 
of 
the 
argument 
may 
not 
seem 
wholly 
free 
from 
objections, 
it 
must 
be 
allowed 
that 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
treatise 
which 
deals 
with 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
project 
could 
be 
easily 
carried 
out, 
with 
the 
forces 
that 
would 
be 
necessary 
for 
the 
purpose, 
with 
the 
methods 
of 
providing 
for 
them 
and 
for 
the 
occupation 
of 
the 
country, 
and 
with 
the 
existing 
condition 
of 
the 
Turkish 
empire 
as 
encouraging 
the 
enterprise 
— 
is 
to 
all 
appearance 
unanswerable, 
and 
full 
not 
only 
of 
sound 
practical 
sense 
but 
of 
a 
knowledge 
of 
detail 
which 
might 
have 
commended 
itself 
to 
the 
best 
informed 
of 
the 
King 
s 
advisers. 
Departmental 
knowledge 
on 
the 
part 
of 
these 
advisers 
was 
not 
the 
least 
among 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
greatness 
of 
Louis 
and 
his 
monarchy; 
and 
a 
very 
strong 
point 
in 
Leibniz 
as 
a 
politician 
was 
that 
he 
never 
spoke 
without 
his 
book. 
Even 
the 
facilities 
for 
retreat, 
should 
theexpedition 
unexpectedly 
prove 
unsuccessful, 
are 
carefully 
outlined; 
and, 
in 
short, 
the 
whole 
project 
is 
so 
satisfactorily 
expounded 
that 
the 
author 
is 
war 
ranted 
in 
dealing 
quite 
succinctly 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
justice 
of 
the 
enterprise 
he 
proposes 
— 
a 
holy 
war, 
conducing 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
humanity, 
and 
to 
the 
advance 
of 
the 
Christian 
faith, 
the 
liberation 
of 
sufferers, 
and 
offering 
an 
opportunity 
of 
revengefor 
the 
wrongsinflictedupon 
France. 


The 
memorandum 
never 
reached 
Louis 
XIV; 
for 
he 
never 
asked 
to 
see 
it. 
In 
June 
1673, 
his 
government 
arrived 
at 
an 
understanding 
with 
the 
Porte, 
and 
his 
interest 
contingent 
as 
it 
was 
— 
in 
the 
design 
came 
to 
an 
end. 
But 
it 
was 
not 
forgotten 
by 
Leibniz, 
though 
he 
now 
speedily 
passed 
from 
France 
into 
England, 
and 
there 
seemed 
absorbed 
in 
the 
differential 
calculus 
and 
Newton. 



Several 
allusion 
to 
its 
central 
thought 
are 
to 
be 
found 
in 
his 
later 
writings, 
moreespecially 
inthehalf-ironical 
The 
Great 
King’s 
Main 
Design 
of 
1687 
or 
8, 
when, 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
most 
shameless 
of 
all 
Louis 
XIV 
s 
wars 
of 
aggression 
— 
the 
Orleans 
War 
— 
he 
asks 
why, 
if 
so 
jealous 
of 
the 
Austrian 
successes 
against 
the 
Turks, 
the 
King 
of 
France 
did 
not 
take 
part 
in 
the 
attack 
upon 
their 
dominions, 
more 
especially 
upon 
Egypt, 
since 
all 
of 
these 
lay 
at 
hismercy. 


ThetwoversionsofLeibniz’ 
Egyptianplanwerenot, 
however,destinedto 
remain 
buried 
among 
his 
papers 
at 
Hanover, 
though 
both 
of 
them 
reposed 
there 
unnoticed 
for 
something 
like 
a 
century 
and 
a 
quarter. 
I 
cannot 
pass 
on 
without 
reminding 
you 
of 
the 
circumstances 
in 
which 
the 
Design 
first 
became 
known 
to 
the 
world, 
and 
thus 
gained 
a 
notoriety 
which 
in 
the 
Europe 
of 
the 
Napoleonic 
Age 
was 
inconceivable 
except 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
connexion 
with 
Napoleon 
himself. 
Before, 
in 
1798, 
Napoleon 
set 
forth 
on 
that 
Egyptian 
expedition 
which 
— 
was 
primarily 
intended 
as 
a 
blow 
against 
Great 
Britain 
with 
what 
ulterior 
conceptions 
or 
visions 
I 
will 
not 
here 
pause 
to 
enquire; 
but 
in 
India, 
too, 
England 
owed 
France 
a 
revanche 
— 
he 
could 
not 
have 
known 
anything 
of 
Leibniz 
s 
design. 
But 
the 
British 
Government 
(through 
the 
vigilance 
of 
the 
Hanoverian 
Regency, 
which 
may 
probably 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
the 
historian 
Johannes 
von 
Müller’s 
knowledge 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
document) 
had 
received 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
larger 
memorial 
from 
Hanover. 
In 
this 
country 
we 
have 
always 
liked 
to 
‘focus’ 
our 
ideas 
about 
foreign 
policy 
as 
definitely 
as 
possible; 
and 
it 
was 
not 
till 
1803, 
shortly 
before 
the 
renewal 
of 
hostilities 
between 
England 
and 
France, 
that 
the 
British 
Ministry 
thought 
it 
worth 
while 
to 
publish 
in 
pamphlet 
form 
a 
very 
effective 
summary 
of 
Leibniz 
s 
memoir. 
Clearly, 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
publication 
was 
not 
so 
much 
to 
open 
the 
eyes 
of 
Britons 
to 
vast 
schemes 
of 
visionary 
conquest 
which 
in 
imitation 
of 
those 
suggested 
to 
Louis 
XIV 
by 
Leibniz 
the 
First 
Consul 
might 
have 



formed, 
as 
to 
revive 
certain 
very 
distinct 
references 
in 
the 
famous 
writer 
s 
statement 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
which 
the 
possession 
of 
Malta 
might 
prove 
to 
France. 
These 
references 
incidental 
to 
the 
days 
of 
Louis 
XIV, 
seemed 
to 
call 
very 
speedily 
for 
publication 
and 
comment 
in 
the 
days 
of 
Napoleon. 
You 
know 
that 
after 
the 
Peace 
of 
Amiens 
we 
found 
ourselves 
unable 
to 
evacuate 
Malta, 
and 
that, 
largely 
in 
consequence 
of 
this 
inability 
on 
our 
part, 
war 
broke 
out 
anew 
between 
England 
and 
France, 
before 
this 
very 
year 
1803 
had 
come 
to 
a 
close. 
The 
French 
immediately 
seized 
Hanover, 
and 
General 
Mortier, 
who 
commanded 
the 
occupying 
troops 
(which 
were 
by 
no 
means 
popularthere)obtaineda 
copyof 
the 
design 
inits 
shorter 
form, 
the 
Consilium 
Aegyptiacum 
aforesaid. 
Thus 
it 
found 
its 
way 
to 
the 
First 
Consul, 
who 
may 
or 
may 
not 
have 
been 
edified 
by 
its 
perusal, 
and 
into 
the 
library 
of 
the 
French 
Academy, 
where 
Thiers 
and 
Michaud 
read 
it 
and 
formed 
incorrect 
conclusionsfromit,whichI 
havenotimefordiscussing. 


One 
more 
remark, 
and 
I 
will 
leave 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
celebrated 
Design. 
Nothingcould 
bemore 
childishthan 
to 
conclude 
that 
the 
treatment 
of 
Leibniz 
in 
this 
matter 
by 
Louis 
XIV 
(which 
political 
considerations 
are 
amply 
sufficient 
to 
explain) 
provoked 
him 
to 
the 
subsequent 
attacks 
made 
by 
him 
upon 
the 
great 
monarch 
and 
arch-disturber 
of 
the 
Peace 
of 
Europe. 
I 
have 
made 
myself 
acquainted 
with 
many 
of 
these 
attacks 
— 
both 
those 
of 
which 
Leibniz 
was 
beyond 
doubt 
the 
author 
and 
those 
of 
which 
the 
indefatigable 
Pfleiderer 
(who 
discovered 
not 
less 
than 
twelve 
anonymous 
pamphlets 
of 
the 
sort 
bound 
up 
in 
a 
single 
volume), 
with 
more 
or 
less 
certainty, 
attributes 
to 
him; 
and 
in 
none 
of 
them 
can 
I 
perceive 
any 
trace 
of 
a 
pettiness 
wholly 
foreign 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
Leibniz. 
He 
had 
to 
undergo, 
and 
underwent 
without 
loss 
of 
dignity, 
provocations 
of 
a 
much 
severer 
sort 
from 
a 
quarter 
where 
he 
deserved 
every 
consideration; 
while 
from 
Louis 
XIV 
he 
had 
nothing 
to 



expect, 
and 
in 
the 
King’s 
refusal 
to 
receive 
him 
could 
have 
found 
very 
little 
toresent. 


The 
most 
notable 
of 
these 
polemical 
invectives 
is 
the 
Mars 
Christianissimus 
— 
the 
most 
Christian 
War 
God 
— 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
dreary 
period 
from 
the 
Peace, 
which 
was 
no 
peace, 
of 
Nimeguen 
and 
the 
outbreak 
of 
the 
so-called 
Orleans 
War 
in 
1688, 
when 
Louis 
XIV, 
in 
Leibniz’ 
words, 
threw 
off 
the 
mask, 
and 
on 
pretexts 
which 
were 
themselves 
so 
many 
insults, 
took 
the 
Empire 
by 
the 
throat. 
The 
Mars 
Christianissimus, 
written 
during 
the 
siege 
of 
Vienna, 
is 
a 
satire 
of 
uncommon 
force, 
and 
is 
marked 
by 
an 
almost 
savage 
irony 
not 
usually 
associated 
with 
the 
urbane 
lucidity 
of 
its 
author. 
The 
moderation 
of 
the 
King 
— 
by 
which 
is 
meant 
his 
ruthless 
enforcement 
of 
the 
principle 
un 
roy, 
une 
foy, 
une 
loy 
— 
is 
the 
theme 
on 
which 
the 
satire 
harps. 
Pomponne 
has 
shown 
the 
way 
out 
of 
the 
stipulations 
of 
the 
Peace 
of 
Westphalia; 
Louvois 
has 
made 
men 
see 
the 
stuff 
of 
which 
German 
Princes 
are 
made. 
This 
is 
as 
it 
should 
be. 
That 
is 
just, 
according 
to 
Plato, 
which 
is 
of 
advantage 
to 
the 
strong; 
and 
Moses 
had 
a 
law 
of 
his 
own 
when 
he 
spoiled 
the 
Egyptians. 
The 
fact 
that 
he 
is 
commissioned 
with 
unheard 
of 
power 
shows 
whose 
Vicar 
Louis 
XIV 
is, 
while 
the 
Pope 
only 
registers 
his 
decrees. 
And 
so 
forth, 
with 
sarcasms 
almost 
savage 
in 
their 
bitterness, 
and 
a 
parade 
of 
charges 
made 
by 
others 
against 
France 
and 
her 
King, 
as 
to 
which 
the 
writer 
pretends 
to 
hold 
up 
deprecatory 
hands. 
There 
is, 
strange 
as 
the 
comparison 
may 
seem, 
a 
touch 
of 
Swift 
in 
all 
this 
— 
though 
the 
object 
of 
the 
veiled 
invective 
is 
a 
very 
different 
one 
from 
that 
of 
any 
of 
Swifts 
famouspamphlets. 


Before 
he 
indited 
this 
exceptionally 
trenchant 
satire, 
Leibniz 
had 
passed 
into 
the 
service 
of 
Duke 
John 
Frederick 
of 
Hanover 
(1676), 
and 
on 
the 
Duke 
s 
death 
three 
years 
afterwards 
into 
that 
of 
his 
brother 
Duke 
(after 
wards 
Elector) 
Ernest 
Augustus 
and 
his 
wife 
Sophia, 
the 
youngest 
daughter 
of 



Elizabeth 
of 
Bohemia 
and 
the 
future 
acknowledged 
heiress 
of 
the 
English 
Crown. 
The 
two 
brothers 
resembled 
each 
other 
in 
many 
respects; 
they 
were 
alike 
very 
much 
intent 
upon 
the 
honour 
and 
glory 
of 
their 
House, 
and 
very 
careful 
of 
their 
own 
comfort; 
they 
preferred 
Venice 
and 
Paris 
— 
the 
former 
in 
those 
days 
the 
chosen 
abode 
of 
luxurious 
pleasure 
— 
to 
Osnabrück 
and 
Hanover, 
but 
they 
did 
what 
they 
could 
to 
make 
their 
own 
courts 
bright 
and 
enjoyable 
and, 
in 
a 
measure, 
refined. 
But 
they 
differed 
in 
both 
their 
religious 
and 
their 
political 
opinions; 
John 
Frederick 
became 
an 
ardent 
Roman 
Catholic, 
while 
Ernest 
Augustus, 
like 
his 
eldest 
son 
after 
him, 
remained 
a 
staunch 
Lutheran, 
without 
being 
much 
affected 
by 
the 
freer 
ways 
of 
thinking 
which 
his 
wifehad 
brought 
fromher 
brother 
s 
court 
atHeidelberg. 
Inpolitics, 
John 
Frederick 
was 
one 
of 
those 
German 
princes 
who 
followed 
the 
lead 
of 
Louis 
XIV 
so 
long 
as 
it 
was 
possible; 
while 
Ernest 
Augustus, 
with 
his 
eldest 
brother 
George 
William 
of 
Celle, 
though 
not 
so 
soon 
as 
he, 
became 
one 
of 
the 
mainstays 
of 
the 
Imperial 
and 
anti-French 
cause, 
influenced 
no 
doubt 
by 
the 
distinction 
gained 
by 
his 
sons 
in 
the 
Imperial 
service 
against 
the 
Turks, 
and 
by 
his 
own 
desire 
to 
secure 
for 
the 
furtherance 
of 
his 
dynastic 
ambition 
thegoodwillof 
the 
Emperor. 


That 
Leibniz 
should 
have 
served 
both 
these 
princes 
with 
equal 
zeal 
and 
devotion 
— 
for 
his 
biographical 
memoir 
of 
John 
Frederick 
is 
written 
in 
the 
courtliest 
strain 
of 
panegyric 
— 
does 
not 
seem 
very 
wonderful, 
more 
especially 
as 
his 
service 
to 
the 
elder 
brother 
was 
of 
so 
short 
duration. 
But 
it 
helps 
to 
account 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
years 
following 
on 
the 
succession 
of 
Ernest 
Augustus 
to 
Hanover 
(from 
1680 
to 
about 
1695) 
were, 
to 
judge 
from 
his 
literary 
activity 
as 
well 
as 
from 
his 
correspondence 
in 
them, 
the 
period 
of 
his 
career 
most 
congenial 
to 
himself 
as 
a 
politician 
— 
the 
aspect 
of 
his 
intellectual 
activities 
to 
which 
I 
must 
confine 
myself 
here. 
Leibniz, 
as 
he 
had 
only 
too 
much 
occasion 
for 
reminding 
the 
Elector 
George 
Lewis, 
both 
before 



and 
after 
the 
Elector 
had 
become 
King 
George 
I, 
was 
a 
faithful 
servant 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Hanover. 
None 
of 
the 
three 
chief 
steps 
towards 
the 
consummation 
of 
its 
greatness 
— 
the 
establishment 
of 
primogeniture 
as 
safeguarding 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
Lüneburg-Celle 
dominions, 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
electoral 
dignity, 
and 
the 
securing 
of 
the 
English 
Succession 
— 
was 
taken 
without 
his 
co 
operation; 
but 
he 
laboured 
with 
the 
greatest 
zeal 
and 
the 
most 
effective 
application 
of 
his 
powers 
when 
he 
felt 
himself 
to 
be 
working 
at 
the 
same 
time 
for 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Hanover 
and 
for 
the 
general 
system 
of 
European 
policy 
which 
he 
had 
at 
heart. 
Thus, 
while 
he 
was 
in 
the 
service 
of 
JohnFrederick, 
Iamnotawarethathe 
producedmorethanonepoliticalpiece 
of 
any 
consequence 
— 
and 
this 
was 
the 
disquisition, 
written 
by 
him 
under 
a 
pseudonym 
of 
rather 
pedantic 
sound 
(Cæsarinus 
Furstenerius), 
on 
a 
topic 
which 
could 
hardly 
be 
held 
to 
be 
of 
European 
interest, 
though 
the 
original 
Latin 
version 
(he 
afterwards 
brought 
out 
a 
French 
replica 
in 
dialogue 
form) 
went 
through 
six 
editions 
in 
a 
single 
year. 
It 
treated 
the 
burning 
question 
of 
the 
right 
of 
German 
princes 
not 
electors 
(Fürsten 
not 
Kurfürsten) 
to 
send 
ambassadors 
not 
mere 
agents 
(legati 
not 
deputati) 
to 
congresses 
and 
conferences; 
but 
it 
treated 
this 
question 
both 
with 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
legal 
and 
historical 
learning, 
and 
also 
with 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
common 
sense 
— 
which 
no 
doubt 
was 
the 
novelty 
accounting 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
publication. 
It 
was, 
in 
fact, 
a 
plea 
for 
the 
principle 
that 
actual 
power 
should 
be 
the 
recognised 
measure 
of 
formal 
rights. 
As 
these 
were 
days 
in 
which 
princes 
desired 
to 
have 
the 
privileges 
of 
electors, 
and 
electors 
to 
have 
the 
title 
of 
Kings 
— 
I 
do 
not 
say 
that 
analogies 
to 
this 
tendency 
could 
not 
be 
found 
in 
later 
times 
when 
kings 
are 
made 
almost 
as 
fast 
as 
they 
are 
unmade 
— 
Leibniz 
s 
admirably 
stated 
pleacannotbe 
saidto 
have 
beeninopportune. 


But 
how 
wide 
became 
his 
range 
of 
topics, 
and 
how 
varied 
were 
his 
opportunities, 
when 
from 
the 
contentionuculæ 
(as 
he 
elsewhere 
calls 
them) 
of 



German 
domestic 
politics 
he 
passed 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
general 
European 
affairs! 
And 
here 
it 
would 
be 
quite 
impossible 
to 
attempt 
anything 
like 
a 
survey, 
or 
to 
enter 
upon 
even 
so 
much 
as 
an 
enumeration 
of 
the 
sheaves 
of 
political 
writings 
from 
his 
hand 
— 
French, 
German 
and 
Latin, 
with 
translations, 
by 
his 
own 
or 
other 
hands, 
into 
different 
European 
tongues 
— 
gathered 
into 
their 
editions 
of 
his 
works 
by 
Klopp 
and 
Foucher 
de 
Careil, 
and 
supplemented 
by 
the 
researches 
of 
Pfleiderer. 
One 
tractate 
discusses 
the 
necessity 
of 
pausing 
when 
things 
were 
going 
badly 
against 
the 
Turks, 
and 
when 
the 
great 
Elector 
of 
Brandenburg 
was 
still 
in 
one 
of 
those 
spiral 
phases 
of 
his 
policy 
which 
give 
so 
much 
trouble 
to 
historians 
convinced 
of 
his 
mission 
— 
a 
necessity 
which 
led 
to 
the 
Truce 
of 
Ratisbon 
in 
1684. 
Another 
is 
concerned 
with 
the 
French 
declaration 
of 
war 
in 
1688, 
answered 
by 
a 
counter-manifesto 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Leopold, 
which 
was 
misattributed 
to 
Leibniz 
by 
his 
biographer 
Guhrauer, 
but 
which 
was 
dissected 
in 
a 
memorandum 
certainly 
written 
by 
him 
for 
the 
use 
of 
the 
imperial 
ministers 
and 
summing 
up, 
with 
not 
less 
force 
than 
elaboration 
(it 
extends 
through 
twenty 
chapters) 
the 
whole 
case 
against 
France 
as 
guilty 
of 
a 
systematic 
violationofthepubliclawofnations. 


A 
third 
treats 
the 
outlook 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
campaign 
of 
1791 
(written 
after 
the 
battle 
of 
Fleurus), 
when 
a 
new 
effort 
seemed 
necessary 
if 
the 
cause 
was 
nottocollapse,andLeibnizinaseries 
of 
“consultations” 
showed 
howclosely 
he 
had 
followed 
both 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
war 
and 
the 
attitude 
of 
the 
allies 
and 
neutrals 
towards 
it. 
These 
are 
but 
specimens 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
his 
indefatigable 
pen 
in 
the 
period 
of 
his 
service 
under 
Ernest 
Augustus; 
and 
I 
only 
wish 
I 
had 
time 
to 
illustrate 
the 
completeness, 
the 
vigour 
and 
the 
general 
effectiveness 
(thatIthinkis 
the 
rightword)oftheseproductions. 


In 
1698 
Ernest 
Augustus 
was 
succeeded 
as 
Elector 
by 
his 
son 
George 
Lewis; 
but, 
largely 
no 
doubt 
because 
of 
Leibniz’ 
devoted 
attachment 
to 
the 



widowed 
Electress 
Sophia, 
and 
her 
continuous 
pleasure 
in 
his 
society 
and 
correspondence, 
he 
remained 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
House. 
But 
the 
marriage 
of 
her 
daughter 
Sophia 
Charlotte 
to 
the 
Elector 
Frederick 
of 
Brandenburg 
(afterwards 
King 
Frederick 
I 
of 
Prussia) 
had 
already 
for 
some 
years 
caused 
Leibniz 
to 
become 
a 
frequent 
visitor 
at 
Berlin. 
This 
Princess 
(a 
woman 
of 
perhaps 
bolder 
mind 
than 
her 
mother, 
though 
less 
distinguished 
by 
the 
kindly 
humour 
which 
in 
the 
latter 
almost 
invariably 
tempered 
the 
expression 
of 
an 
acute 
intelligence) 
was, 
in 
her 
turn, 
much 
attached 
to 
Leibniz 
and 
glad 
of 
his 
frequent 
presence 
where 
‘the 
infinitely 
small,’ 
(as 
it 
is 
to 
be 
feared 
she 
paraphrased 
the 
idiosyncrasy 
of 
her 
consort) 
was 
the 
ordinary 
pabulum 
of 
existence. 
Moreover, 
he 
was 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
long-standing 
friction 
between 
the 
two 
electoral 
Houses, 
and 
he 
did 
his 
best, 
both 
by 
a 
skilful 
exposition 
of 
means 
by 
which 
pettly 
grievances 
between 
them 
could 
be 
removed, 
and 
in 
every 
other 
way 
in 
his 
power, 
to 
aid 
Sophia 
Charlotte 
in 
accomplishing 
the 
purpose 
for 
which 
she 
had 
been 
married 
to 
so 
uninspiring 
a 
husband. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
of 
the 
loyalty 
of 
his 
exertions 
on 
this 
head, 
and 
he 
greeted 
the 
attainment 
by 
Sophia 
Charlotte 
s 
consort 
of 
the 
object 
of 
his 
life 
— 
the 
Prussian 
Crown 
— 
with 
cordial 
sympathy; 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
little 
short 
of 
absurd 
to 
represent 
him 
as 
actuated 
by 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
future 
of 
Germany 
lay 
with 
Prussia, 
and 
not 
with 
Austria. 
Not 
only 
was 
he 
afterwards 
attracted 
to 
Vienna, 
as 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
ignore, 
more 
potently 
than 
he 
ever 
had 
been 
to 
any 
other 
capital; 
not 
only 
is 
it 
probable 
that 
but 
for 
certain 
ecclesiastical 
influences 
he 
would 
have 
found 
a 
permanent 
place 
in 
the 
Emperor’s 
service; 
but 
there 
is 
no 
political 
principle 
more 
consistently 
upheld 
by 
him 
than 
that 
the 
strengthening, 
not 
the 
weakening, 
of 
the 
imperial 
authority, 
of 
which 
in 
this 
age 
there 
was 
no 
thought 
of 
divesting 
the 
House 
of 
Habsburg,wasessentialtothepreservation 
oftheEuropeansystem. 



It 
is 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view, 
as 
much 
from 
that 
of 
preventing 
the 
overthrow 
of 
that 
system 
by 
the 
undue 
aggrandisement 
of 
France 
that 
he 
treats 
the 
question 
of 
the 
Spanish 
Succession, 
and 
comments 
on 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
war 
carried 
on 
(from 
1702 
onwards) 
during 
thirteen 
years 
for 
its 
settlement. 
In 
the 
first 
of 
his 
pamphlets 
belonging 
to 
this 
period 
he 
denounces 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
the 
Habsburg 
claims 
to 
the 
entire 
Spanish 
Monarchy 
by 
the 
Partition 
Treaties 
as 
poltroonery; 
and 
his 
activity 
in 
the 
critical 
months 
ending 
with 
the 
acceptance 
by 
France 
of 
the 
last 
will 
of 
Charles 
II 
was 
extreme: 
these 
writings 
fill 
a 
volume 
and 
a 
half 
of 
Foucher 
de 
Careil, 
where 
they 
are 
arranged 
in 
wild 
chronological 
disorder. 
And 
here 
should 
once 
more 
be 
noted 
his 
literary 
inventiveness 
of 
mise-en-scene. 
A 
Venetian 
sets 
his 
fellow 
Signori 
right 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
their 
interests 
in 
the 
struggle; 
a 
Dutchman 
of 
Amsterdam 
retorts 
on 
a 
sophistical 
publication 
purporting 
to 
come 
from 
Antwerp 
‘but 
fabricated 
in 
a 
French 
shop;’ 
Cardinal 
Portocarrero 
and 
the 
Admiral 
of 
Castile 
confer 
in 
a 
dialogue 
serving 
as 
a 
prelude 
to 
a 
manifesto 
drawn 
up 
by 
Leibniz 
for 
the 
use 
of 
Archduke 
Charles, 
when 
in 
1703 
he 
was 
preparing 
for 
a 
roundabout 
journey 
into 
Spain. 
Leibniz 
was 
concealed 
beneath 
all 
these 
disguises; 
nor 
was 
there 
an 
important 
phase 
in 
the 
war 
which 
he 
fails 
to 
accompany 
by 
his 
comments. 
It 
is 
quite 
true 
that 
what 
may 
be 
called 
the 
Hanoverian 
interest 
is 
not 
lost 
sight 
of, 
the 
conferring 
of 
a 
great 
command 
upon 
the 
Elector 
George 
Lewis 
being 
repeatedly 
urged; 
but 
except 
in 
one 
pamphlet 
(1703) 
where 
it 
is 
stated, 
probably 
with 
perfect 
correctness, 
that 
this 
demand 
would 
certainly 
have 
been 
granted 
had 
William 
III 
lived 
long 
enough, 
it 
is 
only 
incidentally 
made. 
What 
was 
the 
dominant 
thought 
of 
all 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
Leibniz 
as 
a 
politician 
in 
these 
years 
may 
be 
gathered, 
even 
more 
from 
his 
writings 
on 
the 
war, 
from 
his 
writings 
concerning 
the 
Peace 
which 
ended 
it. 
The 
most 
important 
of 
these, 
the 
well-
known 
La 
Paix 
d 
Utrecht 
inexcusable 
(1713) 
was 
written 
not 
only 
with 
the 



object 
of 
exposing 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
Maritime 
Powers 
— 
which 
in 
the 
case 
of 
England 
was 
so 
cynical 
as 
hardly 
to 
need 
exposure, 
for 
though 
the 
Peace 
of 
Utrecht 
canbe 
defended, 
themethods 
bywhichitwas 
concluded 
cannot. 
It 
was 
also 
designed 
to 
justify 
the 
Emperor 
for 
holding 
out 
alone; 
and, 
even 
during 
the 
negotiations 
afterwards 
carried 
on 
at 
Rastadt, 
Leibniz 
stuck 
to 
his 
guns 
professing 
to 
tender 
to 
the 
Emperor 
— 
for 
his 
own 
ears 
only 
— 
advice 
which 
nothing 
but 
conviction 
and 
trust 
in 
the 
future 
could 
have 
induced 
him 
to 
offer 
when 
the 
eleventh 
hour 
had 
all 
but 
passed. 
In 
such 
a 
mood 
Leibniz 
was 
perhaps 
unlikely 
to 
respond 
with 
much 
fervour 
to 
the 
Project 
of 
a 
Perpetual 
Peace, 
forwarded 
to 
him 
by 
that 
amiable 
fellow-philosopher, 
the 
Abbé 
Bernardin 
de 
St. 
Pierre 
which 
(if 
I 
may 
be 
pardoned 
so 
personal 
a 
reference) 
I 
remember 
discussing 
in 
a 
lecture 
delivered 
at 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
new 
Owens 
College 
a 
good 
many 
years 
ago. 
Even 
amiable 
philosophers, 
when 
they 
touch 
the 
border 
of 
politics, 
are 
apt 
to 
say 
dangerous 
things, 
and 
Leibniz 
in 
1715 
was 
not 
prepared 
to 
listen 
to 
the 
suggestion 
that 
a 
suitable 
step 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
Eternal 
Peace 
would 
be 
the 
dissolution 
of 
the 
Holy 
Roman 
Empire. 
His 
own 
dream 
was 
an 
Alliance 
of 
Nations; 
but 
the 
Empire, 
strengthened 
as 
he 
desired 
to 
see 
it, 
seemed 
to 
him 
the 
natural 
nucleusofsuch 
analliance,ratherthan 
anobstacle 
inthepathtowardsit. 


In 
the 
meantime, 
at 
least 
one 
of 
the 
political 
ends 
for 
which 
he 
had 
laboured 
long 
and 
unintermittently, 
though 
at 
first 
with 
very 
doubtful 
prospects 
of 
success 
and 
at 
last 
with 
small 
thanks 
from 
those 
who 
had 
benefited 
by 
his 
efforts, 
had 
been 
accomplished; 
the 
English 
succession 
was 
settled, 
and 
though 
his 
honoured 
mistress 
and 
correspondent, 
the 
Electress 
Sophia, 
had 
gone 
to 
her 
rest, 
the 
House 
of 
Hanover 
had 
been 
established 
upon 
the 
English 
Throne. 
I 
should 
not 
attempt 
on 
this 
occasion, 
even 
were 
time 
left 
tome, 
to 
summarise 
thehistory 
of 
whatwasdone 
and 
whatwithstill 
greater 
wisdom 
was 
left 
undone 
by 
the 
House 
of 
Hanover 
to 
bring 
about 
this 



consummation; 
but 
I 
should 
like 
before 
I 
close 
to 
say 
a 
very 
few 
words 
as 
to 
Leibniz 
s 
share 
in 
these 
transactions, 
though 
even 
of 
this 
I 
can 
only 
refer 
to 
some 
aspects. 
In 
January 
1700 
— 
when 
there 
was 
as 
yet 
no 
apprehension 
of 
the 
death 
of 
William 
III 
or 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
averting 
the 
outbreak 
of 
a 
European 
War 
— 
Leibniz 
and 
the 
active 
English 
ambassador, 
Cresset, 
were 
present 
at 
an 
interview 
between 
the 
Dowager 
Electress 
and 
her 
brother-in-law 
of 
Celle, 
the 
intimate 
friend 
of 
William 
III; 
and 
at 
this 
meeting 
the 
line 
of 
conduct 
was 
settled 
which 
was 
on 
the 
whole 
(though 
not 
without 
some 
occasional 
deviation) 
faithfully 
observed 
by 
the 
Electress 
and 
her 
son. 
In 
July, 
the 
Duke 
of 
Gloucester 
died, 
and 
the 
Electress 
became 
heiress 
presumptive 
to 
the 
throne. 
But 
this 
event, 
though 
it 
called 
for 
increased 
vigilance, 
made 
no 
alteration 
in 
the 
conclusions 
reached 
at 
Celle, 
which 
were 
elaborated 
by 
Leibniz 
in 
the 
Considerations 
on 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Brunswick 
to 
the 
English 
succession 
drawn 
up 
by 
him 
after 
the 
meeting. 
What 
interests 
us 
in 
this 
statepaper 
is 
not 
only 
its 
bearing 
on 
the 
immediate 
issue, 
on 
which 
I 
need 
not 
dwell, 
but 
the 
farsightedness 
of 
some 
of 
its 
wider 
deductions. 
As 
to 
the 
justice 
of 
the 
claims 
of 
the 
House 
of 
Brunswick 
— 
and 
it 
wasthisconsiderationof 
justicewhich 
(as 
weknowtoher 
honour) 
troubled 
the 
Electress 
Sophia 
as 
it 
did 
many 
an 
honest 
Englishman 
of 
the 
time 
— 
he 
argues 
that 
the 
exclusion 
of 
Roman 
Catholics 
and 
the 
descendants 
of 
Roman 
Catholics 
from 
the 
succession 
is 
not 
a 
matter 
for 
the 
consideration 
of 
anyone 
except 
the 
English 
people; 
and 
France 
(he 
rather 
sophistically 
adds), 
which 
proposes 
to 
place 
the 
Duke 
of 
Anjou 
on 
the 
Spanish 
throne 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
will 
of 
the 
Spanish 
nation, 
should 
be 
the 
last 
to 
object. 
As 
to 
the 
actual 
end 
in 
view 
(and 
here 
he 
may 
have 
thought 
of 
the 
unconcealed 
apathy 
of 
the 
future 
King 
George 
I 
towards 
the 
prospect 
of 
adding 
to 
his 
sovereign 
authority 
as 
Elector 
that 
of 
a 
constitutional 
ruler 
over-sea), 
it 
is 
perfectly 
true 
that 
a 
King 
of 
England 
has 
need 
of 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
prudence 
and 
moderation 



in 
order 
to 
govern 
a 
difficult 
people 
and 
one 
very 
jealous 
of 
its 
liberty. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
glory 
of 
a 
prince 
lies, 
not 
in 
attaching 
himself 
to 
his 
ease 
and 
his 
pleasures, 
but 
in 
the 
consciousness 
that 
he 
is 
great 
only 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
securing 
the 
welfare 
of 
all. 
These 
are 
noble 
words, 
and 
worthy, 
not 
of 
a 
servant 
of 
princes 
or 
princelings, 
but 
of 
one 
who 
fitly 
aspired 
to 
be 
the 
adviseroftherulerofagreatandfree 
nation. 


This, 
however, 
was 
not 
to 
be; 
and 
perhaps 
we 
may 
think 
it 
well 
that 
Leibniz 
was 
not 
destined 
to 
be 
lumped 
by 
English 
prejudice 
— 
a 
prejudice, 
let 
us 
allow, 
not 
without 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
provocation 
— 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
German 
counsellors 
and 
favourites 
of 
our 
first 
Hanoverian 
King. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
the 
height 
of 
his 
activity 
belongs 
to 
the 
earlier 
rather 
than 
the 
later 
stages 
of 
the 
Succession 
question 
— 
to 
the 
period 
intervening 
between 
the 
death 
of 
the 
Duke 
of 
Gloucester 
(July 
1700) 
and 
the 
Act 
of 
Settlement 
which 
named 
the 
Electress 
Sophia 
andher 
descendantsas 
successors 
afterthe 
childless 
Queen 
Anne 
(August 
1701), 
and 
the 
conclusion 
(in 
the 
following 
month) 
of 
the 
Grand 
Alliance 
at 
the 
Hague. 
These 
two 
events 
were 
never 
dissociated 
from 
one 
another 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
Leibniz, 
and, 
in 
another 
set 
of 
Considerations 
on 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
English 
Succession, 
he 
showed 
that 
they 
had 
both 
been 
present 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
William 
III, 
when 
he 
delivered 
his 
speech 
from 
the 
throne 
(February 
1701), 
of 
which 
the 
Act 
of 
Settlement 
had 
been 
the 
direct 
result. 
The 
War 
of 
the 
Spanish 
Succession 
was 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
both 
William 
and 
Leibniz 
the 
War 
of 
the 
English 
Succession 
also; 
and 
in 
the 
Peace 
of 
Utrecht, 
which 
settled 
the 
Spanish 
question, 
he 
was 
actually 
desirous 
ofinserting 
specificconditionsthatwouldinhisopinionhaveplaced 
thesettlement 
oftheEnglish 
beyondthereach 
ofdoubt. 


But 
this 
was 
later. 
Even 
when 
he 
was 
at 
what 
I 
have 
described 
as 
the 
height 
of 
his 
political 
influence, 
he 
held 
no 
official 
political 
position 
at 
Hanover, 
and 
was 
in 
no 
sense 
minister 
of 
the 
Electress 
Dowager, 
though 
the 



reports 
of 
her 
special 
agent 
in 
London, 
Falaiseau, 
passed 
through 
his 
hands. 
With 
Bothmer, 
who 
in 
the 
early 
years 
of 
the 
century 
began 
to 
be 
largely 
entrusted 
with 
the 
conduct 
of 
Hanoverian 
diplomacy 
in 
its 
relations 
to 
both 
England 
and 
Holland, 
he 
seems 
generally 
to 
have 
been 
on 
excellent 
terms. 
But 
from 
1705 
onwards, 
when 
after 
the 
reunion 
of 
Celle 
and 
Hanover 
Bernstorff 
became 
the 
leading 
minister 
of 
the 
Elector 
George 
Lewis, 
and 
Bernstorff’s 
right 
hand 
man, 
the 
Huguenot 
Robethon, 
was 
charged 
by 
him 
with 
reports 
on 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
Succession 
question, 
Leibniz’ 
communications 
with 
the 
Electress 
Dowager 
on 
the 
subject 
become 
essentially 
those 
of 
a 
private 
correspondent. 
They 
are 
not 
the 
less 
interesting 
on 
that 
account, 
or 
the 
less 
well 
informed. 
Thus, 
he 
knew 
of 
the 
fateful 
change 
of 
ministry 
in 
England 
long 
before 
it 
actually 
took 
place 
in 
1710: 
‘I 
have,’ 
he 
writes, 
‘friends 
of 
importance 
among 
both 
Whigs 
and 
Tories, 
who 
from 
time 
to 
time 
supply 
me 
with 
good 
information 
because 
I 
am 
known 
to 
havethe 
entrée 
here 
with 
the 
padronanza’ 
(as 
who 
should 
say, 
I 
have 
the 
key 
of 
the 
house). 
There 
are 
some 
people 
in 
England 
who 
would 
like 
me 
to 
pay 
a 
visit 
to 
that 
country, 
and 
I 
find 
that 
things 
would 
be 
explained 
to 
me 
there 
which 
could 
not 
be 
communicated 
by 
the 
ordinary 
channel. 
But 
I 
avoid 
that 
in 
order 
not 
to 
excite 
jealousy.” 
Leibniz, 
in 
political 
enquiries 
as 
in 
historical 
research, 
was 
always 
desirous 
of 
securing 
information 
at 
first 
hand. 
But, 
in 
the 
present 
instance, 
no 
such 
opportunity 
was, 
in 
point 
of 
fact, 
accorded 
to 
him; 
and 
he 
had 
to 
content 
himself 
with 
correspondence 
and 
interviews 
with 
English 
agents 
who 
came 
to 
Hanover, 
and 
with 
the 
consciousness 
that, 
so 
far 
as 
in 
him 
lay, 
he 
had 
from 
first 
to 
last 
neglected 
no 
opportunity 
and 
left 
no 
stoneunturned 
towardstheachievementofthegreatresult. 


Before 
it 
was 
achieved, 
his 
best 
friend 
and 
patroness 
the 
old 
Electress 
Sophia 
had 
taken 
her 
last 
walk 
in 
the 
gardens 
of 
Herrenhausen, 
and 
some 
of 
those 
who 
knew, 
or 
professed 
to 
know, 
attributed 
her 
breakdown 
to 
the 



agitation 
caused 
bythe 
anger 
of 
QueenAnne 
at 
a 
forward 
step 
in 
therelations 
between 
thetwoCourts 
— 
thedemand 
ofa 
writofsummons 
forthe 
Electoral 
Prince 
to 
the 
House 
of 
Lords 
— 
of 
which 
she 
strongly 
disapproved. 
Leibniz, 
though 
he 
heartily 
applauded 
this 
step, 
was 
not 
responsible 
for 
it; 
and 
with 
the 
death 
of 
the 
old 
Electress 
his 
political 
influence 
and 
favour 
at 
Hanover 
were 
likewise 
at 
an 
end. 
For 
the 
Elector 
George 
Lewis, 
who 
soon 
afterwards, 
on 
Queen 
Anne 
s 
decease, 
ascended 
the 
English 
Throne 
as 
King 
George 
I, 
Leibniz 
was, 
as 
has 
been 
well 
said, 
nothing 
more 
than 
an 
admirable 
instrument 
when 
argumentative 
memorials 
were 
required 
in 
support 
of 
the 
interests 
of 
his 
dynasty. 
His 
advice 
was 
not 
valued, 
or 
wanted, 
by 
George 
and 
his 
ministers; 
when 
he 
tendered 
some 
very 
sound 
counsel 
through 
the 
Electoral 
Princess 
as 
to 
the 
expediency 
of 
forming 
a 
ministry 
out 
of 
both 
parties 
instead 
of 
Whigs 
and 
none 
but 
Whigs, 
the 
excellent 
Caroline 
was 
instructed 
to 
inform 
him 
that 
such 
matters 
could 
be 
best 
managed 
on 
the 
spot. 
She 
was 
the 
youngest 
of 
the 
three 
high-minded 
and 
high-spirited 
women 
who 
enjoyed 
and 
valued 
his 
friendship; 
but 
neither 
she 
nor 
the 
old 
Electress 
Sophia 
can 
be 
said 
to 
have 
had 
a 
will 
of 
her 
own 
in 
politics, 
and 
Queen 
Sophia 
Charlotte, 
who 
had 
one 
in 
all 
things, 
could 
not 
in 
this 
sphere 
often 
exercise 
it 
except 
indirectly. 
And 
Caroline 
had 
special 
reasons 
for 
not 
importuning 
her 
father-in-law, 
King 
George 
I, 
who 
disliked 
her 
almost 
as 
much 
as 
he 
disliked 
his 
son, 
her 
husband. 
When 
Leibniz 
indicated 
that 
he 
would 
gladly 
serve 
as 
historiographer 
royal 
in 
England 
he 
was 
plainly 
told 
to 
finishthe 
historiographical 
taskhehadundertakenathome. 


I 
am 
glad, 
almost, 
that 
time 
prevents 
me 
from 
dwelling 
on 
an 
episode 
in 
the 
career 
of 
Leibniz 
— 
unhappily 
it 
was 
the 
closing 
episode 
— 
which 
reflects 
little 
credit 
on 
Bernstorff 
and 
on 
Bernstorff’s 
master. 
I 
would 
say 
that 
it 
reflects 
little 
credit 
on 
the 
earlier 
successors 
of 
George 
I, 
but 
that 
it 
would 
be 
perhaps 
unreasonable 
to 
expect 
any 
of 
them 
after 
George 
II 
to 
have 



remembered 
Leibniz 
or 
the 
great 
historical 
undertaking 
which 
his 
father 
and 
his 
father 
s 
ministers 
had 
for 
years 
urged, 
ordered 
— 
more 
than 
ordered 
— 
the 
great 
scholar 
to 
complete. 
And 
George 
II 
did 
actually 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
command 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Origines 
Guelficæ 
(in 
which, 
as 
treating 
of 
the 
dynasty, 
he 
naturally 
took 
more 
interest 
than 
in 
the 
companion 
work, 
which 
had 
a 
wider 
basis 
and 
a 
wider 
scope), 
and 
four 
out 
of 
the 
five 
folios 
of 
this 
part 
of 
the 
undertaking 
which 
Leibniz 
had 
left 
to 
be 
executed 
by 
his 
assistant, 
successor 
and 
indefatigable 
backbiter 
Eckhart, 
were 
actually 
published 
in 
1753. 
The 
Annales 
Brunsvicenses, 
which 
Leibniz 
himself 
had 
in 
substance 
completed, 
had 
to 
wait 
nearly 
a 
century 
longer, 
when, 
in 
the 
years 
1843-5, 
theywerepublishedas 
partofPertz’s 
Monumenta 
Germaniæ. 
Thusit 
was 
as 
part 
of 
a 
great 
national 
historical 
collection, 
not 
as 
the 
record 
of 
one 
particular 
principality, 
that 
the 
great 
historical 
work 
which 
Leibniz 
had 
been 
unabletolay 
atthefeetofGeorgeI 
wasgivento 
theworld. 


It 
is 
not 
as 
a 
historian 
that 
I 
have 
spoken 
of 
Leibniz 
to 
you 
today. 
I 
wished 
to 
add 
a 
note 
— 
it 
is 
no 
more 
— 
to 
my 
dear 
friend 
and 
honoured 
colleague 
s 
chapter 
only 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
political 
endeavours 
of 
the 
great 
man 
who 
to 
me 
is 
familiar 
from 
this 
side 
only 
or 
chiefly. 
It 
is 
for 
those 
of 
you 
who 
have 
read 
Leibniz 
as 
a 
philosopher 
and 
who 
know 
how 
as 
such 
he 
strove 
to 
bring 
all 
his 
studies 
— 
mathematical, 
linguistic 
and 
the 
rest 
— 
into 
harmony 
with 
his 
philosophical 
conceptions 
of 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
Universe 


— 
it 
is 
for 
you 
to 
say 
whether 
the 
lesser 
side 
of 
his 
activity 
is 
out 
of 
harmony 
with 
the 
greater. 
I 
should 
be 
surprised 
if 
such 
were 
your 
conclusion 
either 
as 
to 
his 
religious 
or 
even 
as 
to 
his 
purely 
temporal 
politics; 
or 
rather 
I 
should 
attribute 
it 
to 
the 
imperfect 
and 
fragmentary 
nature 
of 
my 
note. 
Genius 
is 
not 
pieced 
together 
out 
of 
dissimilar 
or 
discordant 
elements; 
and 
the 
self-
education 
of 
a 
great 
man, 
which 
is 
the 
highest 
type 
of 
all 
education, 
has 
for 
its 
end, 
unattainable 
yet 
never 
to 
be 
renounced, 
the 
perfection 
of 
all 
the 

powers 
which 
he 
holds 
in 
trust. 
No 
doubt, 
Leibniz 
attempted 
too 
much. 
No 
doubt, 
in 
the 
words 
of 
the 
most 
eminent 
of 
his 
biographical 
critics 
(Kuno 
Fischer) 
Leibniz’ 
original 
fault 
was 
the 
impulse, 
which 
he 
found 
irresistible, 
towards 
multiplying 
the 
tasks 
and 
problems 
of 
his 
intellectual 
life, 
together 
with 
the 
spheres 
of 
his 
personal 
activity 
and 
the 
duties 
they 
involved, 
in 
a 
measure 
which 
no 
human 
mind 
and 
no 
single 
career 
could 
ever 
fully 
meet. 
That 
was 
his 
fault 
— 
but 
it 
was 
not 
a 
fault 
which 
posterity 
can 
visit 
heavily 
on 
one 
who, 
as 
I 
have 
already 
reminded 
you, 
did 
perhaps 
more 
than 
any 
other 
modern 
has 
done 
to 
suggest 
and 
supply 
means 
and 
methods 
both 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
higher 
intellectual 
work 
and 
for 
the 
cooperation 
of 
those 
devoted 
to 
it 
in 
learned 
bodies 
which 
would 
recognise 
research 
— 
in 
the 
widest 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
— 
as 
the 
crown 
of 
their 
endeavours. 
That, 
I 
say, 
was 
his 
fault; 
his 
merit 
was 
the 
willing 
sacrifice 
of 
himself 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
progress, 
which 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
truth, 
however 
large 
be 
the 
unavoidable 
admixture 
of 
transitory 
error. 
The 
genius 
of 
Leibniz, 
his 
love 
of 
truth, 
which 
is 
eternal, 
and 
his 
aspirations 
for 
harmony, 
which 
is 
from 
on 
high 
these 
were 
true 
to 
themselves 
even 
in 
that 
secondary 
and 
subsidiary 
branch 
of 
his 
intellectual 
activity 
to 
which, 
for 
this 
reason, 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
not 
unfitting 
to 
call 
yourattentionto-day.

Life

From 
‘Essays 
in 
Philosophy’ 


The 
lately 
republished 
philosophical 
writings 
of 
Leibnitz 
are 
the 
productions 
of 
a 
species 
of 
intellectual 
labour 
that 
is 
very 
rare 
in 
this 
country, 
but 
of 
which, 
in 
Germany. 
France, 
and 
America, 
the 
press 
is 
giving 
forth 
some 
original 
and 
many 
republished 
specimens. 
The 
amount 
of 
republished 
metaphysical 
literature 
of 
the 
higher 
kind 
which 
has 
appeared 
in 
foreign 
countries 
within 
the 
last 
thirty 
years, 
is 
worthy 
of 
remark. 
Some 
idea 
of 
it 
may 
be 
formed 
from 
any 
common 
catalogue 
of 
books 
recently 
issued 
from 
the 
press 
of 
Leipsic, 
Berlin, 
Paris, 
or 
Boston. 
The 
labours 
of 
the 
illustrious 
Cousin 
in 
this 
department 
are 
well 
known. 
The 
works, 
in 
whole 
or 
in 
part, 
of 
Plato,Proclus, 
Abelard,DesCartes, 
André, 
andPascal 
havereappearedunder 
the 
superintendence 
of 
this 
eloquent 
founder 
of 
the 
modern 
eclectic 
school 
of 
France. 


Containing 
as 
they 
do 
the 
results, 
and 
in 
many 
respects 
splendid 
results, 
of 
purely 
abstract 
thinking, 
the 
works 
of 
Leibnitz 
are 
singularly 
fitted 
for 
contributing 
to 
imbue 
the 
mind 
of 
an 
ardent 
student 
with 
comprehensive 
and 
lofty 
speculation. 
While 
his 
writings 
abound 
in 
daring 
hypotheses, 
they 
have, 
nevertheless, 
greatly 
advanced 
metaphysical 
science, 
by 
rendering 
current 
a 
multitudeofnewideas;and 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
continued 
circulation 
ofan 
amount 
of 
abstract 
thought 
so 
great, 
so 
peculiar 
in 
its 
kind, 
and 
so 
fitted 
to 
set 
other 
minds 
to 
work, 
as 
these 
books 
contain, 
can 
never 
be 
unworthy 
of 
the 
consideration 
of 
those 
who 
would 
observe 
and 
study 
literature 
in 
its 
higher 
relations. 
Besides 
their 
intrinsic 
value, 
they 
are 
connected 
with 
an 
important 



epoch 
in 
the 
history 
of 
modern 
speculation. 
This 
philosopher 
looms 
vast 
even 
inthedistance,at 
theentranceofthelabyrinthofrecentGermanPhilosophy. 


Though 
a 
curious 
combination 
of 
circumstances 
has 
hitherto 
preserved 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
British 
mind, 
in 
a 
great 
measure, 
unruffled 
by 
an 
influence 
powerful 
enough 
to 
create 
so 
much 
commotion 
on 
the 
continent 
of 
Europe, 
there 
are 
signs 
in 
the 
literary 
horizon 
which 
betoken 
a 
change, 
for 
which 
society 
in 
this 
country 
would 
do 
well 
to 
be 
prepared. 
By 
the 
well-regulated 
study 
of 
these 
unwonted 
topics, 
we 
may 
not 
merely 
disarm 
the 
enemies 
of 
religion, 
of 
what 
in 
other 
times 
has 
been, 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
be, 
a 
favourite 
weapon 
of 
assault, 
but 
we 
may 
even 
convert 
that 
weapon 
into 
an 
instrument 
of 
use 
in 
the 
service 
of 
an 
enlightenedChristianity. 
Theinterest 
lately 
revived 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
life 
and 
labours 
of 
Leibnitz, 
and 
indicated 
among 
other 
means 
by 
various 
recent 
publications, 
suggests 
some 
meditation 
upon 
the 
leading 
events 
in 
his 
biography, 
accompanied 
with 
a 
few 
historical 
and 
speculative 
notices, 
as 
an 
introduction 
to 
that 
great 
department 
of 
knowledge 
ofwhichhewassodistinguisheda 
cultivator, 
viz. 
MetaphysicalPhilosophy. 


Perhaps 
these 
two 
last 
words 
are 
fitted 
to 
excite 
feelings 
of 
repugnance 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
some 
readers, 
as 
relating 
to 
something 
that 
is 
conceived 
to 
be 
at 
best 
vague 
and 
unproductive. 
The 
tendencies 
of 
public 
opinion 
in 
Great 
Britain, 
in 
the 
former 
half 
of 
this 
century, 
have 
evidently 
been 
greatly 
averse 
from 
these 
speculations. 
The 
section 
of 
society 
given 
to 
abstract 
meditation 
has 
never 
in 
any 
age 
been 
a 
large 
one; 
and 
the 
recent 
wide 
extension 
of 
a 
certain 
measure 
of 
intelligence 
has 
perhaps 
helped 
to 
diminish 
it, 
by 
putting 
the 
current 
literature 
more 
under 
the 
control 
of 
a 
public 
for 
the 
most 
part 
necessarily 
busy 
with 
the 
affairs 
of 
practical 
life. 
If 
we 
except 
the 
rising 
symptoms 
of 
a 
coming 
change 
— 
indicated 
partly 
in 
the 
poetical 
contemplations 
of 
Coleridge 
and 
the 
logical 
philosophy 
and 
learning 
of 
Sir 
William 
Hamilton 
— 
no 
literary 
efforts 
are 
even 
contemplated 
which 
involve 



purely 
speculative 
research; 
and 
hardly 
any 
concern 
is 
manifested 
for 
the 
philosophical 
pursuits 
of 
other 
nations. 
Metaphysical 
Science 
cannot, 
from 
its 
peculiar 
nature, 
be 
made 
generally 
popular 
till 
the 
exercise 
of 
reflection 
has 
become 
more 
common; 
unless, 
indeed, 
as 
sometimes 
happens, 
the 
science 
itself 
is 
degraded, 
so 
that 
(while 
the 
name 
Metaphysic 
is 
retained) 
those 
who 
profess 
to 
be 
its 
votaries 
are 
conversant 
exclusively, 
not 
with 
the 
most 
subtle 
and 
evanescent, 
but 
with 
the 
simplest 
and 
most 
generally 
seductive 
class 
of 
theobjectsofthought. 


The 
present 
is 
a 
remarkable, 
and, 
indeed, 
anomalous 
historical 
epoch. 
In 
these 
islands 
it 
is, 
and 
has 
been 
since 
the 
commencement 
of 
this 
century, 
a 
period 
of 
rapid 
physical 
and 
social 
progress. 
Men 
have 
gained 
an 
increased 
knowledge 
of 
the 
laws 
and 
processes 
of 
matter, 
and 
thus 
the 
world 
is 
becoming 
a 
more 
convenient 
place 
of 
habitation. 
The 
principle 
of 
commerce 
has 
been 
developed 
to 
an 
extent 
unknown 
in 
the 
ancient 
world. 
The 
present 
revolution 
in 
the 
means 
of 
social 
intercourse 
and 
communication 
seems 
to 
be 
preparing 
the 
way 
for 
other 
changes, 
about 
which 
it 
is 
hardly 
safe 
to 
speculate. 
All 
the 
increased 
“subjection 
of 
matter 
to 
mind” 
which 
the 
world, 
and 
especially 
this 
country, 
has 
witnessed 
since 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Baconian 
philosophy 
have 
become 
popular, 
must 
be 
indeed 
gratifying 
to 
every 
lover 
of 
his 
race. 
And 
in 
the 
more 
sublime 
departments 
of 
Physical 
Science 
the 
same 
progress 
is 
visible. 
Geology 
is 
contributing 
the 
details 
of 
the 
past 
history 
of 
the-planet 
on 
which 
we 
live. 
The 
telescope 
is 
making 
magnificent 
disclosures 
of 
the 
distant 
regions 
of 
the 
material 
creation. 
Nor 
is 
public 
interest 
confined 
to 
what 
is 
merely 
physical. 
Society 
itself 
is 
undergoing 
fundamental 
changes; 
and 
the 
“science 
of 
society,” 
under 
its 
twofold 
form 
of 
civil 
and 
ecclesiastical, 
is 
the 
theme 
of 
discussion 
and 
controversy. 



An 
age 
in 
which 
controversy 
turns 
on 
first 
principles 
needs, 
and 
will 
soon 
demand, 
a 
Metaphysical 
Literature. 
That 
state 
of 
knowledge 
and 
of 
general 
opinion 
is 
not 
a 
hopeful 
one, 
in 
which 
the 
thoughts 
and 
energies 
of 
men 
are 
directed 
exclusively 
towards 
physical 
or 
economical 
science. 
And 
when 
the 
intellect 
is 
in 
a 
state 
of 
fermentation, 
bare 
facts, 
separated 
from 
principles, 
excite 
only 
a 
feeble 
interest. 
Men 
then 
feel 
that 
beneath 
the 
stir 
occasioned 
by 
incessant 
activity 
among 
the 
outward 
events 
of 
this 
passing 
world, 
there 
lie 
hid 
the 
invisible 
elements 
and 
springs 
of 
those 
external 
changes 
of 
which 
this 
strange 
and 
dangerous 
life 
is 
the 
scene. 
Within 
and 
immediately 
around 
that 
innercircle, 
is 
thedomain 
peculiar 
to 
Philosophy. 
Themore 
deeply 
thoughtis 
exerted 
on 
any 
subject, 
the 
further 
is 
it 
compelled 
to 
go 
within 
the 
dominions 
of 
this 
“science 
of 
sciences.” 
The 
soul 
there 
casts 
about 
for 
its 
anchorage 
in 
theocean 
ofthought. 


The 
need 
for 
a 
First 
Philosophy, 
of 
the 
kind 
we 
have 
indicated 
in 
the 
foregoing 
paragraph, 
is 
not 
indistinctly 
referred 
to 
by 
Lord 
Bacon:— 
“Because,” 
says 
he, 
“the 
distributions 
and 
partitions 
of 
knowledge 
are 
not 
like 
several 
lines 
that 
meet 
in 
one 
angle, 
and 
so 
touch 
but 
in 
a 
point, 
but 
are 
like 
branches 
of 
a 
tree 
that 
meet 
in 
a 
stem, 
which 
hath 
a 
dimension 
and 
quantity 
of 
entireness 
and 
continuance, 
before 
it 
come 
to 
discontinue 
and 
break 
itself 
in 
arms 
and 
boughs; 
therefore, 
it 
is 
good 
to 
erect 
and 
constitute 
one 
universal 
science 
by 
the 
name 
of 
‘philosophia 
prima,’ 
primitive 
or 
summary 
philosophy, 
as 
the 
main 
and 
common 
way, 
before 
we 
come 
where 
the 
ways 
part 
and 
divide 
themselves; 
which 
science, 
whether 
I 
should 
report 
deficientor 
no,Istanddoubtful.” 


The 
Metaphysical 
spirit 
makes 
itself 
manifest 
in 
various 
forms; 
and 
this 
passage 
from 
Bacon 
in 
several 
respects 
illustrates 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
great 
classes 
into 
which 
philosophers 
may 
conveniently 
be 
divided, 
according 
as 
they 
employ 
one 
or 
other 
of 
two 
modes 
of 
research 
that 
differ 
in 



their 
principles, 
methods, 
and 
results. 
One 
class 
includes 
those 
who 
would 
merely 
generalize 
from 
experience; 
and 
whose 
highest 
laws 
are 
in 
consequence 
only 
their 
most 
extensive 
generalizations. 
The 
other 
class 
assumetheirfirstprinciples 
asgivenintheveryactof 
exercisingobservation, 
and 
by 
demonstration 
endeavour 
to 
reach 
the 
extreme 
results 
of 
philosophy. 
It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
find 
a 
nomenclature 
sufficiently 
comprehensive, 
and 
yet 
distinctively 
characteristic, 
to 
admit 
of 
suitable 
application 
to 
these 
schools. 
Probably, 
that 
suggested 
by 
Sir 
James 
Mackintosh 
is 
sufficiently 
exact 
for 
our 
purpose; 
and 
we 
may 
term 
the 
former 
of 
the 
two 
classes 
we 
have 
referred 
toObservational,and 
thelatterSpeculativeMetaphysicians. 


Leibnitz 
is 
the 
type, 
in 
modern 
times, 
of 
an 
abstract 
thinker 
of 
the 
purely 
speculative 
school. 
It 
is 
curious 
to 
trace 
the 
connexion 
between 
the 
secluded 
and 
seemingly 
ineffective 
study 
of 
what 
Bacon 
calls 
the 
philosophia 
prima, 
in 
the 
form 
in 
which 
it 
appears 
in 
this 
school, 
and 
the 
great 
external 
and 
social 
changes 
in 
the 
world. 
The 
“Advancement 
of 
the 
Sciences” 
is 
obviously 
connected 
with 
the 
astronomy 
of 
Newton 
and 
Herschel. 
The 
“Wealth 
of 
Nations” 
is 
an 
acknowledged 
cause 
of 
many 
recent 
alterations 
in 
modern 
society. 
The 
“Essay 
on 
Human 
Understanding” 
has 
plainly 
influenced 
the 
subsequent 
current 
of 
British 
thought. 
Not 
less 
surely, 
though 
less 
obviously, 
has 
the 
more 
purely 
speculative 
philosophy 
of 
that 
school, 
in 
which 
Leibnitz 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
illustrious 
names, 
been 
connected, 
for 
good 
and 
evil, 
with 
important 
modifications 
of 
those 
minds 
by 
which 
public 
opinion 
must 
be 
formed. 
The 
intimate 
relation 
between 
the 
labours 
of 
men 
of 
this 
class, 
and 
that 
meditative 
style 
of 
Christianity 
which 
is 
displayed 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
some 
of 
the 
great 
names 
in 
the 
Christian 
Church, 
is 
also 
manifest. 
The 
influence 
of 
Idealism 
and 
the 
higher 
Metaphysics 
as 
operative 
forces 
in 
society, 
becomes 
more 
apparent 
when 
we 
observe 
how 
efficacious 
their 
spirit 
hasbeentoneutralizeavulgarsensationalism. 



The 
study 
of 
the 
systems 
of 
Philosophy 
in 
all 
their 
variety, 
and 
of 
the 
lives 
and 
labours 
of 
various 
philosophers, 
is 
to 
be 
encouraged 
for 
many 
reasons. 
It 
supplies 
curious 
and 
useful 
thoughts, 
which 
might 
never 
otherwise 
have 
been 
suggested, 
and 
it 
also 
stimulates 
reflection 
in 
the 
student. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
erratic 
course 
which 
the 
human 
spirit 
has 
taken 
in 
the 
experience 
even 
of 
profound 
thinkers, 
is 
besides 
fitted 
to 
moderate 
dogmatism. 
The 
men 
of 
mightiest 
genius 
are 
found 
often 
to 
have 
fallen 
into 
the 
most 
signal 
errors. 
It 
is 
morally 
useful 
to 
train 
the 
mind 
in 
the 
habit 
of 
calmly 
apprehending 
and 
appreciating 
new 
doctrines, 
however 
opposed 
to 
what 
one 
has 
previously 
been 
accustomed 
to 
entertain. 
“Man,” 
says 
Pascal, 
“is 
made 
for 
thinking. 
To 
think 
as 
we 
ought 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
human 
duty.” 
Habits 
of 
abstract 
meditation 
have, 
moreover, 
a 
use 
additional 
to 
their 
absolute 
value 
to 
the 
individual 
speculator; 
they 
accustom 
men 
to 
a 
kind 
of 
exercise 
which 
must 
always 
be 
closely 
connected 
with 
the 
great 
progress 
epochs 
of 
history; 
and 
by 
the 
lucid 
and 
comprehensive 
views 
which 
they 
foster, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
invigorating 
effect 
of 
the 
act 
of 
self-inspection, 
they 
become 
a 
potent 
force 
among 
those 
at 
workin 
society. 


Some 
knowledge 
of 
the 
personal 
history 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
likely, 
besides 
its 
intrinsic 
use 
and 
interest, 
to 
be 
a 
valuable 
help 
to 
the 
reader 
who 
desires 
to 
understand 
and 
appreciate 
his 
writings. 
It 
is 
satisfactory 
to 
find 
that 
most 
of 
the 
materials 
collected 
by 
former 
biographers, 
eulogists, 
and 
commentators, 
along 
with 
some 
new 
information, 
have 
lately 
been 
condensed 
into 
a 
useful 
biography 
by 
Dr. 
Guhrauer, 
who 
has 
already 
laboriously 
edited 
several 
of 
the 
works 
of 
Leibnitz, 
and 
contributed 
to 
the 
revival 
of 
an 
interest 
in 
the 
philosopher. 
His 
monograph 
is 
well 
fitted 
to 
bring 
the 
reader 
into 
intercourse 
with 
the 
great 
German, 
and 
with 
those 
numerous 
contemporaries 
with 
whom 
he 
maintained 
a 
“literary 
commerce” 
during 
the 
grand 
period 
in 
which 
he 
lived. 



Gottfried 
Wilhelm 
Leibnitz 
was 
born 
in 
Leipsic 
on 
the 
21st 
of 
June 
1646. 
He 
was 
descended 
of 
an 
ancient 
family, 
that 
had 
gained 
distinction 
in 
civil 
and 
ecclesiastical 
affairs. 
His 
grand-uncle, 
Paul 
Leibnitz, 
attracted 
notice 
in 
thewarsinHungary,andwas 
highlyhonoured 
bythe 
EmperorRodolph 
II. 


We 
must 
not 
omit 
a 
special 
allusion 
to 
the 
eventful 
epoch 
of 
the 
philosopher’s 
birth. 
Just 
a 
hundred 
years 
before, 
Luther 
had 
rested 
from 
his 
earthly 
labours, 
during 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
most 
memorable 
religious 
and 
social 
change 
which 
the 
world 
has 
witnessed 
since 
the 
introduction 
of 
Christianity. 
But 
soon 
after 
the 
Reformer’s 
death, 
Christian 
doctrine, 
owing 
in 
a 
great 
measure 
to 
the 
want 
of 
Christian 
organization 
in 
the 
Church, 
became, 
especially 
in 
Germany, 
gradually 
separated 
more 
and 
more 
from 
the 
hearts 
of 
nominally 
Christian 
men. 
The 
coldness 
of 
mathematical 
demonstration 
represented 
Christianity 
in 
the 
pulpits 
and 
halls 
of 
the 
country 
of 
the 
Reformation, 
where, 
in 
the 
seventeenth 
century, 
the 
icy 
orthodoxy 
of 
Calixtus 
tooktheplaceofthefervid 
sermonsof 
Luther. 


The 
period 
of 
the 
Protestant 
Reformation 
was 
a 
time 
of 
much 
general 
excitement 
and 
progress 
in 
society, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
era 
of 
a 
great 
revolution 
in 
the 
Church. 
The 
modern 
reformation 
of 
Philosophy 
was, 
however, 
formally 
inaugurated 
at 
a 
later 
period. 
During 
the 
fifteenth 
and 
sixteenth 
centuries, 
the 
recovery 
and 
revived 
use 
of 
the 
remains 
of 
antiquity 
supplied, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
sufficient 
materials 
for 
literary 
activity. 
The 
controversy 
between 
the 
Aristotelians 
and 
the 
Ramistsin 
the 
sixteenth 
century 
had, 
moreover, 
diverted 
men’s 
minds 
from 
the 
production 
of 
a 
Philosophy 
altogether 
modern 
and 
reformed. 
The 
birth 
of 
Leibnitz 
was 
just 
subsequent 
to 
the 
time 
when, 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
evangelical 
movement 
having 
unhappily 
abated 
in 
most 
countries, 
a 
movement 
towards 
a 
reform 
of 
Philosophy 
had 
succeeded. 
The 
mind 
is 
not 
likely 
at 
any 
time 
to 
be 
strongly 
stirred 
in 
a 
science 
like 
Theology, 
without 
being 
directed 
to 
“the 
science 
of 
sciences.” 
A 
New 



Philosophy 
was 
making 
its 
appearance 
in 
England 
and 
France. 
Bacon’s 
“Advancement 
of 
the 
Sciences” 
appeared 
in 
1605, 
and 
the 
“Method” 
of 
Des 
Cartes 
in 
1637. 
In 
each 
country 
thought 
and 
research 
had 
assumed 
a 
fundamentally 
different 
form. 
In 
England, 
the 
practical 
character 
of 
the 
people 
well 
agreed 
with 
the 
lessons 
of 
comprehensive 
sagacity 
that 
were 
given 
forth 
in 
the 
works 
of 
Bacon; 
and 
these 
naturally 
led 
to 
the 
solid 
and 
cautious, 
yet 
withal 
little 
imaginative 
form, 
which 
metaphysical 
science 
assumed 
afterwards 
in 
the 
works 
of 
Locke; 
and 
through 
Locke, 
generally, 
in 
Britishphilosophy. 
In 
France,ontheotherhand, 
the 
philosophicalwritings 
of 
Des 
Cartes 
had 
awakened 
that 
style 
of 
speculation 
which 
cannot 
be 
wholly 
dormant 
while 
the 
spirit 
of 
Plato 
and 
St. 
Augustin 
attracts 
sympathy 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
which 
in 
France, 
subsequently 
to 
Des 
Cartes, 
was 
adorned 
and 
elevated 
by 
some 
of 
the 
noblest 
and 
worthiest 
spirits 
of 
modern 
times. 
Besides 
the 
lives 
of 
Malebranche 
and 
Fénelon, 
those 
of 
Pascal, 
and 
Arnauld, 
and 
Nicole, 
and 
the 
other 
recluses 
of 
Port-Royal, 
give 
to 
the 
Cartesian 
a 
more 
sacred 
interest 
than 
can 
be 
attached 
to 
any 
other 
modern 
school 
of 
Philosophy. 
Although 
this 
peculiar 
feature 
of 
its 
history 
is 
marred 
by 
that 
mystic 
quietism 
which 
the 
monastic 
genius 
of 
the 
Catholic 
Church 
tends 
to 
foster, 
it 
is 
encouraging 
to 
find 
even 
this 
imperfect 
illustration 
of 
the 
manner 
inwhichChristianitymay 
bealliedtogeneralspeculation. 


But 
Germany 
was 
thenceforward 
to 
be 
the 
European 
focus 
of 
Idealism, 
and 
of 
abstract 
thinking 
of 
every 
kind. 
In 
that 
country, 
previously 
to 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
Leibnitzian 
philosophy, 
there 
had 
been 
no 
manifestation 
of 
the 
new 
spirit 
of 
reform. 
The 
labours 
of 
Leibnitz 
virtually 
mark 
the 
commencement 
of 
theextraordinarycourse 
whichmetaphysic 
hassincerunin 
the 
nativecountry 
of 
that 
celebrated 
thinker. 
Since 
then, 
the 
principle 
which 
at 
first 
separated 
the 
schools 
of 
Locke 
and 
Leibnitz 
has 
modified 
the 
currents 
of 
thought 
in 
Britain 
and 
Germany, 
and 
is 
thus 
connected 
with 
many 
of 
those 



characteristics 
by 
which 
the 
British 
is 
signally 
distinguished 
from 
the 
Continental 
mind. 
Since 
then, 
too, 
Germany 
has 
been 
the 
centre 
of 
European 
speculation, 
and 
has 
exhibited 
some 
of 
the 
most 
extraordinary 
phenomena 
in 
the 
history 
of 
human 
thought. 
There, 
amid 
the 
successive 
revolutions 
of 
more 
than 
a 
hundred 
years, 
every 
abstract 
question 
has 
been 
debated 
that 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
can 
entertain;andthere 
has 
been 
added 
to 
precedingones,perhaps 
the 
most 
remarkable 
and 
instructive 
of 
all 
the 
records 
of 
the 
clouded 
wanderings 
of 
human 
reason. 
The 
discussions 
raised 
by 
Leibnitz 
have 
given 
birth 
to 
the 
philosophical 
systems 
of 
Kant, 
Fichte, 
Schelling, 
and 
Hegel, 
and 
so 
to 
the 
nowenormouslyaccumulatedmaterialsofthe 
Teutonicmetaphysics. 


ThefatherofLeibnitzwasProfessor 
ofMoralsin 
the 
ancient 
Universityof 
Leipsic. 
He 
died 
during 
the 
childhood 
of 
his 
son. 
By 
his 
pious 
mother, 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
young 
Gottfried 
Wilhelm 
were 
much 
directed 
to 
religion; 
and 
this 
guidance 
no 
doubt 
gave 
to 
his 
subsequent 
speculations 
much 
of 
that 
theological 
cast 
by 
which 
they 
are 
distinguished. 
Both 
his 
parents 
were 
Lutherans. 
The 
first 
twenty 
years 
of 
his 
life 
were 
spent 
chiefly 
in 
Leipsic. 
In 
theNicolai 
Schoolofthatcity,and 
also 
in 
the 
University, 
whichhe 
enteredin 
1661, 
he 
gave 
early 
evidence 
of 
his 
peculiar 
type 
of 
genius. 
His 
powers 
of 
mind 
were 
directed, 
in 
turn, 
to 
almost 
every 
object 
of 
knowledge. 
He 
eagerly 
studied 
history 
and 
the 
classics, 
in 
which 
his 
reading 
extended 
far 
out 
of 
the 
beaten 
track 
in 
which 
the 
ill-judged 
exertions 
of 
his 
narrow-minded 
teachers 
would 
fain 
have 
restrained 
him. 
It 
was, 
however, 
when 
he 
was 
introduced 
to 
Logic 
and 
Philosophy, 
that 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
genius, 
and 
the 
special 
direction 
of 
his 
mind, 
were 
fully 
shown. 
He 
read 
Aristotle, 
Plato, 
and 
Plotinus, 
and 
revelled 
in 
the 
subtleties 
of 
the 
scholastic 
metaphysics 
— 
that 
stimulant 
of 
the 
human 
intellect 
for 
so 
many 
hundred 
years. 
In 
his 
father’s 
richly-stored 
library, 
he 
read, 
almost 
during 
the 
years 
of 
childhood, 
Scotus, 
and 
Fonseca, 
and 
Rubius, 
and 
Suarez, 
and 
Zabarella, 
and 
other 
schoolmen, 



with 
special 
delight. 
To 
the 
literature 
of 
theology 
he 
was 
no 
stranger, 
even 
at 
this 
early 
period. 
His 
thoughts 
were 
directed 
to 
the/ 
deep 
controversies 
about 
election 
and 
grace, 
by 
the 
works 
of 
St. 
Augustin 
and 
Luther, 
the 
reformed 
theology, 
and 
the 
writings 
of 
Antony 
Arnauld. 
The 
amount 
of 
learning 
accumulated 
by 
this 
precocious 
student 
before 
he 
entered 
the 
University 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
prodigious. 
Soon 
after 
his 
entrance 
on 
academical 
life, 
Des 
Cartes 
fell 
into 
his 
hands. 
His 
tendency 
towards 
eclecticism, 
afterwards 
more 
fully 
displayed, 
was 
even 
then 
shown 
in 
endeavours 
to 
harmonize 
Plato 
and 
Aristotle, 
Des 
Cartes 
and 
the 
schoolmen. 
The 
scholastic 
logic 
and 
philosophy 
was 
then 
dominant 
in 
Leipsic, 
as 
it 
was 
in 
most 
of 
the 
other 
universities 
of 
Germany. 
The 
formal 
spirit, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
mechanical 
style 
of 
instruction 
then 
generally 
prevalent 
in 
Germany, 
harmonized 
ill 
with 
the 
fire 
of 
speculation 
that 
was 
already 
kindled 
in 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
youthful 
Leibnitz. 
A 
thousand 
chimeras 
of 
speculation 
floated 
through 
his 
brain. 
He 
started 
a 
thousand 
difficulties 
with 
his 
teachers 
and 
associates. 
Even 
Bacon, 
and 
Des 
Cartes, 
and 
the 
later 
Philosophy, 
served 
to 
awaken 
rather 
than 
to 
convince 
him. 
His 
mind 
was 
too 
independent 
to 
be 
moulded 
by 
others. 
His 
intellect 
revolted 
from 
the 
authority 
of 
his 
masters. 
In 
solitude, 
he 
cherished 
the 
most 
ardentviewsof 
theadvancementofknowledgeand 
theprogressofman. 


The 
whole 
history 
of 
the 
early 
years 
of 
Leibnitz 
forms 
a 
precious 
record 
of 
what 
we 
might 
call 
speculative 
experience. 
It 
reveals 
the 
self-educating 
genius 
of 
the 
really 
original 
mind, 
and 
shows 
a 
singular 
development 
of 
abstract 
thought 
at 
an 
age 
when 
the 
attention 
is 
usually 
engrossed 
with 
the 
objects 
of 
sense. 
In 
his 
recorded 
experience, 
at 
the 
age 
of 
sixteen, 
are 
to 
be 
foundthedimformsofthoseproblems 
whichagitatedhisthoughtsduringthe 
most 
active 
years 
of 
his 
life. 
For 
days 
together, 
as 
he 
tells 
us, 
he 
was 
wont 
to 
pursue 
his 
walks 
alone 
in 
the 
woods 
of 
Rosenthal, 
near 
Leipsic, 
revolving 
in 
his 
soul 
the 
first 
principles 
of 
that 
mysterious 
life, 
to 
a 
consciousness 
of 



which 
he 
had 
become 
awake. 
Before 
he 
had 
studied 
mathematics, 
physics, 
or 
morals, 
he 
was 
led 
to 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
higher 
Philosophy. 
He 
felt, 
what 
can 
be 
felt 
only 
by 
the 
true 
metaphysician, 
— 
the 
need 
for 
a 
scheme 
of 
eternal 
first 
principles 
on 
which 
all 
knowledge 
must 
depend. 
This 
was 
the 
theme 
of 
his 
earliest 
writings. 
His 
speculations 
on 
a 
universal 
language, 
grounded 
on 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
alphabet 
of 
thought, 
and 
his 
treatise 
De 
principio 
individui, 
published 
when 
under 
twenty, 
display 
the 
metaphysician 
capable 
of 
going 
back 
to 
first 
principles, 
and 
of 
following 
consequences 
intrepidly 
to 
their 
issues. 
In 
these 
labours 
of 
this 
early 
period, 
we 
have 
a 
fair 
specimen 
of 
the 
whole 
intellectual 
life 
of 
Leibnitz. 
They 
are, 
moreover, 
eminentlycharacteristicoftheNational 
Philosophywhichheoriginated. 


Owing 
to 
a 
difference 
with 
the 
University 
authorities, 
Leibnitz 
left 
Leipsic, 
and 
his 
native 
country 
of 
Saxony, 
and 
in 
1666 
went 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Altdorf. 
There 
he 
received 
his 
degree 
in 
law 
the 
same 
year. 
He 
thus 
belongs 
to 
that 
class 
of 
distinguished 
philosophers 
who 
have 
been 
bred 
to 
the 
legal 
profession. 
The 
philosophy 
of 
law 
naturally 
attracted 
his 
thoughts. 
At 
the 
age 
of 
twenty-one, 
he 
published 
a 
tract 
on 
jurisprudence, 
which 
forms 
an 
epoch 
in 
that 
science. 
“There 
was 
only 
one 
man 
in 
the 
world,” 
says 
Hallam, 
“who 
could 
have 
left 
so 
noble 
a 
science 
as 
philosophical 
jurisprudence 
for 
pursuits 
of 
a 
still 
more 
exalted 
nature, 
and 
for 
which 
he 
was 
still 
more 
gifted; 
and 
that 
man 
was 
Leibnitz. 
He 
passed 
onwards 
to 
reap 
the 
golden 
harvests 
of 
otherfields.” 


After 
leaving 
the 
University, 
he 
led 
a 
somewhat 
desultory 
life 
for 
several 
years. 
During 
the 
interval 
between 
1666 
and 
1676, 
he 
visited 
several 
of 
the 
German 
universities, 
which 
must 
have 
served 
to 
confirm 
his 
academical 
tendencies. 
A 
professorial 
chair 
was 
soon 
within 
his 
reach, 
but 
was 
declined 
by 
one 
whose 
projects 
of 
Reform 
in 
Philosophy 
were 
too 
comprehensive 
to 
be 
confined 
within 
the 
narrow 
limits 
of 
a 
University. 
In 
1667 
he 
removed 
to 



Frankfort, 
where 
he 
became 
Secretary 
to 
the 
Baron 
von 
Boineburg, 
and 
was 
patronized 
andemployed 
by 
the 
ElectorofMentz. 
Duringhis 
residenceinthe 
Electorate, 
he 
was 
much 
engaged 
in 
public, 
legal, 
and 
diplomatic 
labours, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
literary 
pursuits. 
Yet 
his 
mind 
was 
all 
the 
time 
pervaded 
by 
the 
great 
idea 
of 
his 
life. 
He 
found 
time 
to 
edit 
the 
Antibarbarus 
of 
the 
Italian 
Nizolius,and, 
besides, 
was 
active 
intheologicalcontroversy. 
TheBaron, 
who 
was 
born 
in 
the 
Lutheran 
Church, 
had 
joined 
the 
communion 
of 
Rome, 
and 
was 
much 
interested 
in 
a 
scheme 
for 
the 
union 
of 
the 
Romish 
and 
Lutheran 
Churches. 
This 
eclectic 
movement 
was 
not 
forgotten 
by 
Leibnitz 
at 
a 
later 
periodinhislife. 


His 
speculations 
about 
this 
time 
are 
marked 
by 
the 
vagueness 
naturally 
characteristic 
of 
one 
who 
had 
cast 
off 
the 
authority 
of 
others, 
and 
had 
not 
resolved 
a 
system 
for 
himself. 
It 
was 
the 
transition-period 
in 
his 
life, 
during 
which 
his 
recorded 
thoughts 
teem 
with 
the 
germs 
of 
those 
ideas 
that 
are 
found 
in 
a 
matured 
form, 
and 
in 
profuse 
variety, 
in 
the 
Nouveaux 
Essais 
and 
the 
Théodicée. 


These 
years 
are 
still 
more 
marked 
as 
the 
period 
of 
the 
commencement 
of 
that 
literary 
intercourse 
which 
afterwards 
accumulated 
so 
enormously, 
and 
in 
which 
Leibnitz 
always 
appears 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
thinking 
spirits 
of 
his 
age. 
It 
commenced, 
and 
was 
maintained, 
among 
others, 
with 
kindred 
minds 
in 
the 
Cartesianschool 
—withMalebranche,therecluseauthorof 
the 
Recherche 
de 
la 
Vérité, 
of 
whom 
we 
have 
the 
interesting 
records 
that 
his 
genius 
lay 
dormant, 
till 
it 
was 
kindled 
by 
contact 
with 
the 
speculations 
of 
Des 
Cartes, 
and 
that 
his 
controversy 
about 
Idealism 
with 
Berkeley, 
on 
the 
only 
occasion 
they 
ever 
met, 
so 
roused 
the 
ardour 
of 
the 
then 
aged 
philosopher, 
that 
his 
death 
is 
recorded 
a 
few 
days 
afterwards 
— 
and 
with 
Arnauld, 
the 
pious, 
contemplative 
Jansenist 
of 
Port-Royal, 
the 
theological 
and 
philosophical 
antagonist 
of 
Malebranche. 
Leibnitz 
visited 
Arnauld 
at 
Paris 
in 
1672, 
and 



remained 
in 
that 
brilliant 
metropolis 
during 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
few 
following 
years. 
In 
1673, 
he 
went 
for 
a 
short 
time 
to 
London, 
and 
came 
in 
contact 
with 
many 
of 
the 
English 
savans 
— 
among 
others, 
with 
Collins 
and 
Sir 
Isaac 
Newton. 
Shortly 
before 
his 
death, 
for 
the 
first 
and 
last 
time, 
Spinoza, 
— 
that 
type 
of 
the 
demonstrative 
metaphysician, 
received 
a 
visit 
at 
the 
Hague 
from 
the 
now 
rising 
Saxon 
philosopher. 
From 
the 
wonderful 
logical 
concatenation 
of 
the 
system 
of 
Spinoza, 
his 
mind 
must 
have 
received 
a 
powerfulimpression.

The 
sceptical 
Bayle 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
the 
useful 
instrument 
of 
the 
more 
full 
development 
of 
his 
ideas 
— 
an 
indirect 
benefit 
which

The 
year 
1676 
is 
an 
era 
in 
the 
life 
of 
Leibnitz. 
Death 
had 
taken 
away 
his 
patrons 
the 
Elector 
of 
Mentz 
and 
Von 
Boineburg. 
He 
was 
himself 
in 
Paris. 
But 
his 
reputation 
in 
Germany 
was 
now 
of 
the 
highest. 
He 
accepted 
an 
offer, 
tendered 
for 
the 
third 
time, 
to 
reside 
at 
the 
brilliant 
literary 
court 
of 
Hanover. 
Thus 
commenced 
a 
connexion 
which 
lasted 
during 
the 
remaining 
forty 
years 
of 
his 
life, 
and 
in 
which 
he 
held 
a 
succession 
of 
legal 
and 
literary 
offices, 
under 
the 
Duke 
John 
Frederic 
and 
his 
successors, 
the 
Electors 
Ernest 
Augustus, 
and 
George 
Louis, 
— 
the 
latter 
of 
whom 
became 
George 
I. 
of 
England 
two 
years 
before 
the 
death 
of 
Leibnitz. 
The 
additional 
means 
enjoyed 
by 
him 
at 
Hanover 
for 
gratifying 
the 
peculiarities 
of 
his 
genius, 
were 
used 
with 
his 
characteristic 
ardour. 
The 
variety 
of 
his 
aims 
during 
these 
forty 
years 
is 
marvellous. 
The 
development 
of 
his 
speculative 
genius 
continued 
to 
advance, 
and 
his 
thoughts, 
stirred 
from 
their 
lowest 
depths 
by 
the 
cycle 
of 
the 
sciences 
during 
that 
whole 
period, 
would 
present 
an 
exceedingly 
curious 
spectacle, 
if 
we 
could 
have 
these 
changes 
in 
the 
current 
of 
the 
soul 
represented 
to 
the 
senses. 
History, 
languages, 
geology, 
mathematics, 
chemistry, 
medicine, 
politics, 
and 
theology, 
in 
turn 
secured 
his 
attention, 
and 



his 
busy 
spirit 
collected 
the 
various 
learning 
of 
each 
department. 
His 
almost 
superhuman 
versatility 
of 
mind 
secured 
for 
Leibnitz 
the 
highest 
distinction 
in 
most 
of 
the 
sciences 
which 
come 
within 
the 
range 
of 
human 
thought. 
In 
history 
he 
laboured 
for 
years 
on 
the 
antiquities 
of 
the 
house 
of 
Brunswick, 
and 
the 
early 
annals 
of 
Germany. 
An 
experience 
of 
the 
extreme 
difficulty 
of 
historical 
researches 
suggested 
to 
him 
what 
may 
be 
styled 
the 
comparative 
anatomy 
of 
languages 
as 
an 
instrument 
for 
facilitating 
his 
efforts 
to 
travel 
backwards 
into 
the 
past. 
To 
the 
study 
of 
languages 
he 
accordingly 
applied 
himself 
with 
incredible 
zeal. 
He 
laid 
ambassadors 
and 
Jesuit 
missionaries 
under 
contribution 
for 
philological 
facts. 
In 
prosecuting 
this 
one 
department 
of 
investigation, 
he 
maintained 
a 
vast 
correspondence. 
Facts 
gathered 
from 
China 
and 
the 
Eastern 
tongues 
served 
to 
animate 
his 
exertions, 
and 
added 
new 
materials 
for 
speculation. 
Not 
content 
with 
the 
records 
and 
memorials 
of 
the 
past, 
contained 
in 
the 
words 
and 
works 
of 
man, 
he 
interrogated 
the 
globe 
itself. 
In 
his 
speculations 
on 
the 
physical 
vestiges 
of 
its 
early 
history, 
we 
find 
curious 
anticipations 
of 
recent 
geological 
hypotheses. 
These 
may 
be 
seen 
in 
a 
smalltractentitled 
Protogea. 


Leibnitz 
was 
able, 
in 
an 
unusual 
degree, 
to 
combine 
the 
external 
and 
the 
contemplative 
life. 
A 
great 
part 
of 
his 
time 
was 
busied 
with 
the 
conduct 
of 
civil 
and 
ecclesiastical 
negotiations. 
His 
correspondence 
regarding 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
Church, 
with 
the 
Landgrave 
of 
Hesse-Rheinfels, 
with 
Arnauld, 
with 
Spinola, 
and 
with 
Bossuet, 
which 
occupied 
more 
or 
less 
of 
his 
time 
during 
twenty 
years, 
deserves 
some 
distinct 
notice. 
The 
reunion 
of 
the 
Protestants 
with 
the 
Church 
of 
Home 
was 
then 
placed 
by 
Leibnitz 
in 
the 
first 
rank 
of 
those 
questions 
on 
a 
settlement 
of 
which 
his 
heart 
was 
set. 
By 
his 
philosophic 
mind 
this 
adjustment 
was 
felt 
to 
be 
nearly 
related 
to 
his 
previously 
ascertained 
speculative 
doctrine 
of 
the 
theocracy, 
and 
a 
universal 
hierarchy. 
His 
veneration 
for 
the 
Romish 
theory 
of 
a 
living 
infallible 
authority, 



supplementary 
to, 
and 
expository 
of, 
the 
written 
word 
of 
Scripture, 
was 
indeed 
coupled 
with 
a 
protest 
against 
the 
existing 
corruptions 
of 
the 
Church, 
and 
an 
expression 
of 
his 
fear 
that 
a 
formal 
adherence 
to 
Rome 
on 
his 
own 
part 
might, 
from 
(the 
practical 
intolerance 
of 
the 
Romish 
theologians, 
cramp 
the 
freedom 
of 
his 
philosophical 
speculations. 
Though 
he 
thus 
firmly 
resisted 
all 
solicitations 
to 
join 
the 
outward 
communion 
of 
Rome, 
yet 
his 
heart, 
and 
perhaps 
his 
conviction, 
was 
accorded 
to 
the 
system 
of 
the 
hierarchy. 
His 
love 
for 
scholastic 
learning 
may 
have 
biassed 
his 
inclinations 
in 
this 
direction, 
and 
his 
comprehensive 
genius, 
like 
that 
of 
many 
other 
kindred 
spirits, 
found 
gratification 
in 
the 
vast 
unity 
and 
completeness 
of 
the 
ideal 
Catholic 
Church, 
with 
its 
ritual, 
and 
its 
organization, 
apparently 
so 
suited 
for 
all 
the 
various 
characters 
and 
circumstances 
of 
those 
whom 
it 
desires 
to 
embrace 
within 
its 
ample 
fold, 
and 
all 
bearing 
so 
much 
the 
semblance 
of 
a 
fitting 
picture 
of 
that 
still 
vaster 
organization 
wherein 
he 
loved 
to 
contemplate 
the 
whole 
universe 
reclaimed 
into 
the 
harmony 
of 
the 
government 
of 
the 
All-holy 
and 
the 
All-
wise. 
Yet 
this 
part 
of 
the 
life 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
not 
one 
that 
can 
be 
studied 
with 
unmixed 
satisfaction. 
The 
source 
of 
those 
oscillations 
of 
opinion 
which 
are 
sometimes 
the 
consequence, 
in 
honest 
and 
devout 
minds, 
of 
a 
many-sided 
view 
of 
an 
extremely 
comprehensive 
subject, 
seems 
hardly 
sufficient 
to 
account 
for 
the 
inconsistencies 
of 
Leibnitz 
in 
his 
negotiations 
with 
the 
representatives 
oftheChurchofRome. 


During 
the 
later 
years 
of 
his 
life 
he 
was 
much 
engaged 
with 
another 
project 
of 
ecclesiastical 
union. 
A 
scheme 
was 
promoted 
by 
him 
about 
the 
year 
1697, 
(under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Courts 
of 
Hanover 
and 
Berlin,) 
for 
a 
generalunion 
of 
the 
Protestants 
against 
Rome,andespecially 
of 
the 
two 
great 
sections 
of 
Protestantism, 
— 
the 
Lutheran 
and 
the 
Reformed. 
It 
was 
quite 
suited 
to 
the 
eclectic 
genius 
of 
the 
philosopher, 
and 
was 
long 
pressed 
by 
him 
on 
the 
attention 
of 
Europe. 
He 
laboured 
to 
destroy 
what 
he 
called 
the 
“idle 



phantoms” 
by 
which 
the 
Protestant 
Churches 
were 
separated. 
But 
the 
defects 
which 
marked 
his 
other 
scheme 
of 
universal 
Christian 
communion, 
marred 
this 
project 
of 
Protestant 
union. 
Both 
were 
essentially 
political 
and 
philosophical. 
They 
fail 
to 
recognise 
Religion 
and 
the 
Church 
as 
independent 
powers, 
whose 
liberties 
are 
essential 
for 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
the 
ends 
of 
the 
Christian 
society. 
Even 
this 
philosopher 
seems 
not 
to 
have 
felt, 
that 
when 
religion 
becomes 
the 
slave 
of 
merely 
human 
authority, 
it 
ceases 
to 
be 
either 
the 
great 
instrument 
of 
civilisation, 
or 
the 
means 
of 
preparing 
men 
for 
full 
union 
in 
the 
City 
of 
God. 
The 
pious 
Spener, 
who 
had 
personally 
experienced 
its 
supernatural 
force, 
predicted 
the 
ill 
issue 
of 
the 
Conference 
for 
Union 
held 
in 
Hanover 
in 
1698, 
at 
which 
Leibnitz, 
Jablonski, 
and 
Molanus 
were 
present. 
The 
result 
justified 
his 
sagacity. 
A 
scheme 
for 
ecclesiastical 
union 
or 
cooperation, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
successful, 
should 
be 
able 
to 
assume 
the 
spirit 
of 
hearty 
and 
supreme 
devotion 
to 
religion 
on 
the 
part 
of 
those 
who 
are 
to 
be 
united. 
The 
progress 
of 
the 
great 
spiritual 
commonwealth, 
and 
not 
the 
political 
arrangementsofnations, 
mustbeitsrulingprinciple. 


The 
general 
doctrine 
of 
toleration, 
and 
the 
laws 
which 
regulate 
the 
attainment 
of 
truth, 
were 
frequently 
the 
subjects 
of 
incidental 
speculation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Leibnitz, 
connected 
as 
they 
are 
with 
ecclesiastical 
unity, 
and, 
indeed, 
with 
the 
discussion 
of 
whatever 
relates 
to 
the 
social 
or 
individual 
good 
estate 
of 
man. 
His 
disposition 
was 
naturally 
tolerant. 
In 
his 
works 
we 
have 
repeated 
glimpses 
of 
those 
doctrines 
which 
have 
now 
become 
much 
more 
widely 
diffused 
through 
society, 
and 
which 
were 
so 
admirably 
enforced 
by 
his 
great 
contemporary 
Locke. 
He 
appreciates 
with 
cordiality 
the 
value 
of 
the 
prevalence 
of 
mild 
sentiments, 
and 
an 
unsectarian 
spirit, 
as 
means 
for 
the 
discovery 
and 
diffusion 
of 
truth 
— 
habits 
of 
mind, 
which, 
we 
are 
glad 
to 
believe,arebecomingnow 
ofmoregenerallyrecognised 
moralobligation. 



Even 
the 
speculative 
discussion 
of 
this 
class 
of 
subjects 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
exhausted. 
There 
is 
room 
for 
an 
investigation 
into 
those 
general 
relations 
among 
men 
considered 
as 
members 
of 
society, 
in 
regard 
to 
individual 
belief 
or 
opinion, 
which 
the 
moral 
law 
demands, 
and 
which 
reason 
and 
experience 
approve, 
as 
best 
fitted 
to 
secure 
the 
most 
extensive 
diffusion 
of 
truth; 
and 
in 
subordination 
to 
which 
all 
special 
social 
organization, 
civil 
and 
ecclesiastical, 
ought 
to 
be 
regulated. 
The 
full 
solution 
of 
this 
great 
problem 
is 
still 
among 
thoselefttoexercise 
the 
mindsof 
themenofthisorof 
some 
futureage. 


Throughout 
the 
forty 
years 
of 
his 
connexion 
with 
the 
Court 
of 
Hanover, 
Leibnitz 
maintained 
his 
literary 
intercourse 
with 
unabated 
energy. 
In 
this 
period 
he 
settled 
and 
extended 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
literary 
republic 
of 
Europe. 
In 
1687, 
he 
travelled 
up 
the 
Rhine, 
ransacked 
the 
libraries 
and 
archives 
of 
Bavaria, 
Bohemia, 
and 
Vienna, 
and 
promoted 
his 
acquaintance 
with 
learned 
men. 
In 
1689, 
he 
went 
to 
Italy, 
and 
gained 
free 
access 
to 
the 
Vatican 
and 
Barberini 
libraries. 
His 
intercourse 
with 
the 
Jesuits 
and 
other 
religious 
Orders, 
was 
all 
turned 
to 
the 
account 
of 
adding 
to 
his 
stores 
of 
learning. 
After 
visiting 
Rome, 
he 
travelled 
through 
Italy, 
and 
returned 
to 
Hanover 
in 
1690, 
only 
to 
resume 
his 
labours 
in 
the 
Royal 
library, 
of 
which 
he 
had 
been 
appointed 
keeper. 
In 
1700, 
he 
was 
the 
means 
of 
founding 
the 
famous 
Berlin 
Academy 
of 
Sciences, 
meant 
by 
him 
to 
be 
a 
centre 
of 
German 
literary 
and 
scientific 
intercourse 
and 
effort. 
He 
was 
unfortunately 
unsuccessful 
in 
his 
endeavour 
to 
establish 
at 
Vienna 
another 
institute 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
and 
on 
a 
still 
more 
comprehensive 
plan. 
He 
was 
much 
interested 
in 
the 
civilisation 
of 
the 
rising 
Russian 
empire, 
and 
had 
personal 
conferences 
on 
the 
subject 
with 
Peter 
the 
Great. 
He 
busied 
himself 
with 
the 
progress 
of 
education 
and 
missionary 
exertion 
in 
Russia, 
and 
also 
in 
the 
German 
States, 
where 
he 
was 
anxious 
that 
the 
schools 
and 
colleges 
should 
be 
seminaries 
of 
Protestantmissions. 



Amid 
all 
his 
diversified 
projects, 
and 
stupendous 
literary 
activity, 
the 
metaphysical 
tendency 
ever 
preserved 
the 
ascendency 
in 
the 
genius 
of 
Leibnitz. 
His 
philosophical 
principles 
were 
gradually 
matured 
soon 
after 
his 
settlement 
in 
Hanover. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
Monads 
was 
developed 
in 
a 
succession 
of 
publications 
subsequent 
to 
1680. 
Some 
of 
his 
most 
valuable 
contributions 
to 
Philosophy 
are 
due 
to 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
celebrated 
“Essay 
on 
Human 
Understanding,” 
which 
appeared 
in 
1690, 
and 
at 
once 
attracted 
his 
attention. 
There 
could 
be 
little 
mutual 
sympathy 
between 
two 
philosophers 
so 
completely 
antagonist 
as 
the 
author 
of 
the 
“Essay” 
and 
himself. 
Locke 
despised 
what 
he 
called 
the 
“chimeras” 
of 
Leibnitz. 
The 
Teutonic 
philosopher 
accorded 
to 
his 
English 
contemporary 
the 
praise 
of 
perspicuity, 
but 
proclaimed 
his 
utter 
ignorance 
of 
the 
“demonstrative 
metaphysics.” 
In 
1703, 
Leibnitz 
being 
disengaged, 
undertook 
a 
formal 
reply 
to 
Locke, 
which 
he 
completed 
in 
the 
following 
year. 
The 
death 
of 
Locke 
caused 
an 
indefinite 
postponement 
of 
the 
publication 
of 
this 
work, 
which 
did 
not 
appear 
till 
long 
after 
the 
death 
of 
the 
author. 
In 
1765, 
it 
was 
given 
to 
the 
world 
by 
the 
industrious 
Raspe. 
This 
work, 
published 
under 
the 
title 
of 
“Nouveaux 
Essais 
sur 
l’Entendement 
Humain,” 
is 
his 
philosophical 
masterpiece, 
and 
contains 
the 
substance 
of 
all 
that 
has 
been 
advanced 
by 
him 
onbehalf 
ofhisspeculativesystem,againsttheschool 
ofLocke. 


The 
manner 
of 
publication 
adopted 
by 
Leibnitz 
was, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
fragmentary. 
His 
“Système 
de 
l’Harmonie 
Préétablie” 
is 
developed 
in 
various 
small 
treatises. 
There 
is, 
however, 
one 
great 
work, 
which 
is 
more 
popular 
and 
practical 
in 
its 
style, 
and 
therefore 
more 
generally 
known 
than 
almost 
any 
of 
his 
other 
writings, 
the 
preparation 
of 
which 
occupied 
much 
part 
of 
many 
years 
in 
his 
life. 
We 
refer 
to 
the 
Théodicée 
— 
a 
book 
which 
holds 
a 
front 
rank 
in 
the 
very 
small 
class 
of 
works 
specially 
conversant 
with 
the 
philosophy 
of 
religion. 
The 
design 
of 
the 
Théodicée 
is 
to 
reconcile 
the 



existenceandcontinuanceofevilintheuniverse 
withthecharacterofGod 
— 
to 
remove 
the 
difficulty 
that 
has 
been 
raised 
in 
all 
ages, 
and 
in 
all 
religions, 
and 
that 
may 
be 
reckoned 
the 
fundamental 
metaphysical 
problem 
of 
the 
Christian 
philosophy. 
It 
has 
already 
been 
indicated 
that 
the 
thoughts 
of 
Leibnitz 
were 
directed 
to 
these 
subjects 
from 
the 
time 
of 
his 
decided 
intellectual 
development. 
In 
1671 
he 
wrote 
a 
tract 
on 
Free 
Will 
and 
Predestination. 
The 
negotiations 
about 
Church 
union 
perhaps 
led 
him 
to 
take 
a 
greater 
interest 
in 
these 
speculations, 
in 
as 
far 
as 
the 
circulation 
of 
doctrines 
fitted 
to 
harmonize 
with 
the 
dark 
phenomena 
of 
the 
moral 
world 
the 
biblical 
view 
of 
the 
character 
of 
God, 
might 
facilitate 
the 
peace 
of 
the 
Church. 
The 
avowed 
purpose 
of 
the 
Théodicée 
is 
to 
refute 
the 
sceptical 
principle 
of 
Bayle, 
who 
denied 
the 
consistency 
of 
faith 
and 
reason, 
and 
thus 
laid 
a 
foundation 
for 
universal 
doubt. 
The 
public 
appearance 
of 
the 
book 
in 
1710, 
produced 
a 
profound 
sensation. 
It 
was 
received 
with 
applause 
by 
most 
of 
the 
continental 
universities, 
but 
the 
prevalence 
of 
Locke’s 
Philosophy 
in 
England 
disposed 
thepublicmind 
inthis 
country 
toreceiveit 
withdistaste. 


The 
current 
of 
speculation, 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
Leibnitz, 
continued 
to 
flow 
during 
the 
later 
years 
of 
the 
philosopher’s 
life. 
In 
1714, 
he 
drew 
up 
a 
scheme 
of 
his 
Philosophy 
for 
the 
use 
of 
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Savoy, 
(La 
monadologie.) 
This 
period 
of 
his 
life 
was 
also 
signalized 
by 
his 
correspondence 
with 
Des 
Bosses. 
The 
close 
of 
1715 
is 
memorable 
as 
the 
commencement 
of 
a 
still 
more 
interesting 
correspondence. 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
Princess 
of 
Wales, 
he 
assailed 
the 
philosophical 
and 
religious 
principles 
of 
the 
school 
of 
Locke 
and 
Newton. 
This 
called 
forth 
Samuel 
Clarke 
in 
their 
defence. 
The 
replies 
of 
Leibnitz, 
and 
the 
rejoinders 
of 
Clarke 
contain 
as 
large 
an 
amount 
of 
curious 
speculation 
as 
any 
work 
of 
modern 
times. 
The 
manner 
of 
God’s 
relation 
to 
the 
universe 
— 
the 
nature 
of 
miracles 
— 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
divine 
and 
human 
will 
— 
the 
ideas 
of 
space 
and 
time 
— 
and 
the 
character 
and 
limits 
of 
the 
material 
world, 
are 



among 
the 
stores 
of 
this 
magazine 
of 
speculative 
discussion. 
The 
controversy 
was 
continued 
with 
increasing 
zeal 
on 
both 
sides. 
Inferior 
in 
power 
of 
generalization 
and 
originality 
to 
his 
antagonist, 
the 
intellect 
of 
Clarke 
was 
possessed 
of 
an 
acuteness 
and 
logical 
force 
which 
rendered 
him 
one 
of 
the 
most 
skilful 
of 
philosophical 
disputants, 
and 
demanded 
a 
full 
display 
of 
the 
comprehensivenessand 
grandeurofmindofhisGerman 
rival. 


But 
that 
mighty 
spirit 
was 
now 
to 
close 
his 
connexion 
with 
this 
mysterious 
scene 
of 
existence. 
Leibnitz 
had 
suffered 
from 
occasional 
illness 
during 
several 
preceding 
years. 
These 
attacks, 
however, 
passed 
away, 
and 
the 
philosopher 
resumed 
his 
speculations 
with 
renewed 
energy. 
In 
November 
1716, 
when 
he 
had 
to 
prepare 
his 
reply 
to 
Clarke’s 
fifth 
letter, 
his 
illness 
returned 
with 
great 
violence. 
We 
have 
no 
distinct 
record 
indicating 
that 
the 
moral 
sensibilities 
of 
the 
Philosopher 
were 
rightly 
alive 
to 
the 
decisive 
nature 
of 
the 
awful 
change. 
His 
seventy 
years 
are 
ended, 
and 
the 
lightning 
seems 
lost 
among 
dark 
clouds. 
During 
the 
last 
day 
of 
his 
life, 
we 
are 
told 
he 
was 
busied 
in 
conversation 
with 
his 
physician 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
his 
disease, 
and 
on 
the 
doctrines 
of 
alchymy. 
Towards 
evening 
his 
servant 
asked 
him 
if 
he 
would 
receive 
the 
Eucharist. 
“Let 
me 
alone,” 
said 
he; 
“I 
have 
done 
ill 
to 
no 
one. 
I 
have 
nothing 
to 
confess. 
All 
must 
die.” 
He 
raised 
himself 
on 
the 
bed 
and 
tried 
to 
write. 
The 
darkness 
of 
death 
was 
gathering 
around 
him. 
He 
found 
himself 
unable 
to 
read 
what 
he 
had 
written. 
He 
tore 
the 
paper, 
and 
lying 
down, 
covered 
his 
face 
with 
his 
hands. 
A 
few 
minutes 
after 
nine 
o’clock 
on 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
14th 
November 
1716, 
Leibnitz 
ceased 
to 
breathe. 
It 
is 
affecting 
to 
the 
imagination 
to 
contemplate 
a 
human 
spirit, 
whose 
course 
of 
thought 
throughout 
life 
was 
unsurpassed 
for 
power 
of 
speculation, 
and 
daring 
range 
of 
mind 
among 
the 
higher 
objects 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
who, 
at 
the 
very 
period 
of 
its 
departure, 
was 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
a 
controversy 
about 
the 
mysteries 
of 
the 
supersensible 
world, 
— 
thus 
summoned 
into 
that 
world, 
to 
become 



conversant 
in 
his 
final 
relations 
with 
the 
Being 
who 
had 
intrusted 
him 
with 
mental 
power, 
and 
whose 
nature 
and 
attributes 
had 
so 
often 
tasked 
his 
speculativeenergies. 


The 
effect, 
upon 
many 
minds, 
of 
the 
record 
of 
the 
life 
of 
this 
Philosopher, 
may 
be, 
perhaps, 
akin 
to 
a 
confused 
amazement 
at 
the 
spectacle 
of 
continued 
mental 
exercises 
so 
unparalleled 
in 
kind 
and 
variety. 
Yet 
a 
vague 
impression 
of 
this 
sort 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
the 
predominant 
one. 
A 
grand 
unity 
pervades 
the 
seeming 
confusion 
in 
which 
this 
man’s 
life 
seems 
enveloped. 
A 
reigning 
idea 
which 
diffuses 
a 
community 
of 
principle 
through 
the 
whole 
cycle 
of 
his 
works, 
we 
have 
traced 
back 
in 
the 
earliest 
operations 
of 
his 
reflecting 
powers. 
Conversant 
through 
his 
life 
with 
those 
mysteries 
in 
proof 
of 
which 
no 
reason 
can 
begiven,andwithreal 
orseeming 
demonstrationsfoundedonthese 
“first 
principles,” 
we 
find 
in 
Leibnitz 
the 
type 
or 
model 
of 
the 
speculative 
metaphysician. 
The 
present 
seems 
a 
fit 
occasion 
for 
bestowing 
the 
notice 
of 
a 
short 
discussion 
on 
this 
suggested 
subject, 
which 
is 
connected 
with 
an 
important 
contribution 
made 
by 
Leibnitz 
to 
philosophy. 
The 
consideration 
of 
it 
may, 
besides, 
make 
us 
advantageously 
familiar 
with 
some 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
that 
atmosphere 
in 
which 
has 
been 
gathered 
the 
cloud 
that 
has 
darkened 
subsequent 
German 
speculations, 
and 
rendered 
metaphysical 
science, 
in 
one 
aspectofit, 
retrogradein 
thatcountry. 


Des 
Cartes, 
the 
reviver 
and 
reformer 
of 
Speculative 
Philosophy 
in 
modern 
times, 
commenced 
his 
philosophical 
career 
with 
the 
practice 
of 
universal 
doubt, 
as 
the 
means 
of 
reaching 
the 
elements 
of 
knowledge. 
Thus 
set 
loose 
in 
the 
microcosm 
of 
thought, 
he 
found 
the 
consciousness 
of 
self-existence 
inseparable 
from 
the 
act 
of 
thinking. 
“Cogito, 
ergo 
sum” 
was 
accordingly 
his 
first 
principle. 
Involved 
in 
the 
rudiments 
of 
self-consciousness, 
he 
found 
the 
idea 
of 
an 
all-perfect 
Being, 
whose 
attributes 
require 
the 
certainty 
of 
all 
that 
is 
clearly 
and 
distinctly 
recognised 
by 
us. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
these 
assumptions, 



he 
thought 
himself 
prepared 
to 
defend 
knowledge 
against 
the 
assaults 
of 
scepticism. 
But 
the 
supposed 
foundation 
was 
too 
narrow. 
The 
tests 
proposed 
for 
its 
extension 
were 
too 
vague. 
The 
effects 
soon 
became 
apparent. 
The 
disciples 
and 
admirers 
of 
Des 
Cartes 
maintained 
doctrines 
the 
most 
various. 
Malebranche 
could 
not, 
without 
the 
infallible 
Church, 
retain 
an 
external 
world. 
The 
Egoists, 
whose 
existence 
as 
a 
sect 
is, 
however, 
somewhat 
problematical, 
having 
declared 
their 
inability 
to 
rise 
beyond 
the 
first 
axiom 
of 
their 
master, 
rested 
there 
amid 
the 
fluctuations 
of 
a 
merely 
subjective 
universe. 
Spinoza, 
unable 
to 
defend, 
by 
reasoning, 
our 
faith 
in 
finite 
substances, 
absorbed 
mind 
and 
matter 
in 
one 
all-pervading 
Existence. 
Des 
Cartes 
had, 
in 
truth, 
proposed 
to 
the 
thinking 
world 
an 
insoluble 
problem, 
when 
hesought 
to 
reach 
theextreme 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
self-consciousness 
alonebeing 
given. 


Leibnitz 
saw 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
Cartesian 
principle. 
He 
longed 
to 
solve 
the 
hitherto 
unsolved 
difficulty 
of 
a 
First 
Philosophy. 
Des 
Cartes, 
by 
directing 
him 
to 
the 
mind 
itself, 
through 
which 
we 
reflect, 
had, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
clearly 
shown 
the 
quarter 
in 
which, 
those 
results 
of 
which 
he 
was 
in 
quest 
are 
to 
be 
found. 
The 
maxim 
of 
the 
school 
of 
Locke 
was 
“nihil 
est 
in 
intellectu 
nisi 
quod 
prius 
in 
sensu.” 
The 
famous 
addition, 
“nisi 
intellectus 
ipse” 
expresses 
the 
distinctive 
peculiarity 
of 
Leibnitz. 
But 
how 
is 
the 
“intellectus 
ipse” 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
“quod 
prius 
in 
sensu?” 
The 
discovery 
of 
a 
test 
for 
marking 
this 
distinction, 
is 
an 
important 
addition 
made 
by 
him 
to 
the 
common 
stock 
of 
philosophical 
principle. 
He 
has 
expressed 
its 
nature, 
among 
other 
places, 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Bieling, 
in 
which, 
speaking 
of 
Locke, 
he 
asserts 
that 
he 
has 
“no 
idea 
of 
the 
demonstrative 
metaphysics. 
Could 
he 
have 
made 
the 
distinction 
between 
necessary 
truth, 
which 
we 
obtain 
by 
intuition, 
and 
those 
other 
truths 
which 
we 
reach 
by 
experience, 
he 
would 
have 
found 
that 
the 
senses 
teach 
us 
only 
what 
takes 
place, 
not 
what 



must 
take 
place.” 
All 
those 
ideas 
which 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
think, 
accordingly, 
belong 
to 
the 
very 
structure 
of 
the 
soul 
itself, 
and 
are 
to 
be 
included 
as 
articles 
of 
ouroriginal 
Faith. 
Thecritical 
philosophy 
of 
Kantisan 
attempt, 
by 
the 
application 
of 
this 
principle, 
to 
collect 
the 
several 
truths 
with 
which 
the 
soul 
is 
at 
first 
furnished, 
and 
to 
view 
them 
in 
their 
relation 
to 
the 
added 
factsofexperience. 


Philosophy 
has 
ever 
been 
a 
struggle 
between 
the 
spirit 
of 
doubt 
and 
the 
spirit 
of 
dogmatism 
— 
of 
which 
the 
one 
declines 
to 
admit 
as 
true 
any 
conclusion 
that 
is 
not 
the 
result 
of 
logical 
deduction, 
and 
the 
other 
assumes, 
in 
whole 
or 
in 
part, 
the 
principles 
which 
the 
sceptic 
assails. 
Men 
in 
all 
ages 
have 
been 
oscillating 
between 
these 
extremes. 
The 
many, 
in 
whom 
the 
love 
of 
order 
and 
simplicity 
naturally 
predominates, 
and 
who 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
aiming 
at 
a 
philosophy 
in 
which 
every 
assumption 
and 
conclusion 
is 
capable 
of 
being 
conceived 
and 
explained 
by 
the 
understanding, 
may 
find, 
in 
the 
singularly 
acute 
“ 
Treatise” 
of 
Hume, 
the 
results 
of 
such 
shallow 
metaphysics. 
A 
more 
profound 
view 
of 
what 
is 
revealed 
to 
reflection, 
finds 
an 
infinity 
of 
things 
which 
the 
understanding 
cannot 
solve, 
and 
which, 
while 
not 
contrary 
to 
sense, 
are 
yet 
above 
sense. 
A 
love 
for 
the 
mystic 
obscurity 
in 
which 
this 
principle 
involves 
the 
higher 
truths 
of 
knowledge, 
may 
confine 
an 
enthusiastic 
thinker 
exclusively 
within 
that 
region 
of 
abstraction, 
and 
conduct 
him 
altogether 
away 
from 
sense 
and 
experience, 
till, 
lost 
in 
the 
supersensible 
forms 
of 
thought, 
he 
resolves 
the 
actual 
into 
the 
ideal; 
and 
thence, 
in 
a 
different 
direction, 
reaches 
practically 
the 
very 
scepticism 
from 
which 
his 
previous 
course 
was 
a 
seeming 
divergence. 
Faith 
is, 
on 
the 
one 
side, 
lost 
in 
the 
dark 
abyss 
of 
doubt: 
on 
the 
other, 
it 
evaporates 
in 
the 
sunny 
haze 
of 
the 
empyrean 
of 
transcendentalism. 
In 
either 
case, 
a 
pretended 
philosophy, 
instead 
of 
guiding 
the 
perplexed 
labourers 
who 
are 
pressing 
on 
with 
their 
workbelow,onlyadds 
tothefogs 
whichalreadydarkentheir 
atmosphere. 



It 
is, 
notwithstanding, 
evident 
that 
the 
perfect 
philosophy 
must 
recognise 
and 
include 
a 
body 
of 
first 
principles, 
resting 
on 
faith, 
by 
which 
all 
knowledge 
of 
things 
divine 
and 
human 
must 
be 
regulated. 
As, 
in 
the 
material 
world, 
the 
lever 
needs 
a 
fulcrum 
before 
it 
can 
work, 
so, 
in 
the 
world 
of 
thought, 
these 
mysteries 
are 
the 
indispensable 
fulcrum 
of 
intellectual 
exertion. 
To 
obtain 
a 
refuge 
from 
doubt, 
and 
a 
sure 
and 
rational 
foundation 
on 
which 
knowledge 
and 
action 
may 
be 
based, 
must 
always 
be 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
higher 
philosophy. 
The 
tendency 
of 
men 
of 
earnestness 
and 
reflection 
in 
this 
direction, 
depends 
on 
the 
maxim 
involved 
in 
the 
very 
act 
of 
reflecting; 
for 
the 
root 
of 
reflex 
thinking 
is 
the 
consciousness 
which 
we 
feel, 
that 
in 
rigorous 
search 
for 
truth 
or 
decisive 
controversy, 
we 
are 
called 
to 
labour 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
an 
ultimate 
principle 
which 
shall 
either 
itself 
explain 
that 
about 
which 
we 
speculate, 
or 
else 
supply 
a 
self-evident 
reason 
that 
to 
us 
it 
is 
inexplicable. 
Reason 
would 
be 
interminable, 
if 
it 
did 
not 
find 
its 
ultimate 
limit 
in 
truths 
which 
it 
cannot 
prove. 
Every 
principle 
must 
be 
either 
resolvable 
by 
the 
understanding, 
or 
must 
rest 
on 
faith; 
and 
as 
every 
conceivable 
question 
may 
be 
thus 
carried 
down 
to 
faith, 
all 
knowledge 
runs 
into 
mystery. 
An 
adjustment 
of 
the 
fact 
of 
this 
realm 
of 
mystery, 
from 
which 
no 
effort 
can 
disconnect 
us, 
has 
everbeen 
theprofounddifficulty 
with 
men 
of 
contemplative 
minds, 
and 
one 
which 
the 
labours 
of 
thinking 
men 
of 
all 
ages 
have 
advanced 
only 
a 
very 
few 
steps 
towards 
a 
solution. 
Its 
mal-adjustment 
in 
the 
philosophical 
system 
has 
already 
wrought 
havoc 
with 
the 
highest 
and 
most 
solemn 
interests 
of 
men. 
Along 
the 
borders 
of 
this 
shaded 
land, 
have 
arisen 
the 
miasmata 
of 
the 
schools 
of 
Elis 
and 
Alexandria, 
of 
Spinoza 
and 
the 
new 
German 
philosophy, 
and 
of 
eastern 
mysticism. 
Hitherto, 
Scottish 
thinkers, 
with 
a 
very 
few 
exceptions, 
have 
tried 
practically 
to 
substitute 
an 
analysis 
of 
mental 
phenomena, 
in 
place 
of 
the 
real 
difficulties 
of 
metaphysical 
speculation. 
But 
abstract 
reflection, 
if 
legitimately 
pursued, 



must 
in 
the 
end 
place 
us 
in 
contact 
with 
these 
difficulties. 
If 
in 
some 
minds 
the 
floodgates 
of 
universal 
doubt 
are 
thus 
opened, 
this 
is 
a 
discipline 
we 
cannot 
avoid. 
Mysteries 
are 
needed 
as 
means 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
knowledge. 
Theyare, 
moreover, 
suggestedto 
the 
soul 
byall 
its 
mostprominent 
objectsof 
thought 
— 
by 
the 
starry 
heavens 
— 
by 
the 
infinite 
space 
in 
which 
we 
and 
they 
are 
included 
— 
by 
the 
awful 
eternity 
through 
which 
we 
are 
passing 
— 
by 
the 
consciousness 
of 
our 
own 
existence 
— 
by 
the 
revelation 
of 
Him 
“in 
whom 
we 
live 
and 
move 
and 
have 
our 
being” 
— 
by 
the 
sublime 
realities 
of 
a 
moral 
law, 
and 
a 
responsible 
because 
personal 
agency 
— 
and 
by 
the 
dark 
shades 
of 
guilt 
in 
which 
a 
portion, 
at 
least, 
of 
that 
created 
personal 
agency 
is 
involved. 
Of 
mysteries 
like 
these 
we 
cannot 
rid 
ourselves. 
They 
rise 
in 
a 
thousand 
forms, 
and 
in 
them 
all 
knowledge 
merges. 
The 
question 
here 
reverts 
to 
deep-thinking 
minds, 
How 
are 
we 
to 
deal 
with 
them, 
and 
what 
place 
is 
to 
be 
assigned 
to 
them? 
We 
may 
still 
“report 
deficient” 
the 
Philosophia 
Prima 
of 
Bacon; 
but 
with 
the 
instructive 
lesson 
of 
the 
extravagancies 
of 
Continental 
speculation 
before 
our 
eyes, 
and 
the 
sober 
Christian 
discipline 
of 
the 
Scottish 
mind 
for 
an 
additional 
sedative, 
we 
may 
yet 
become 
better 
prepared 
for 
the 
calm 
discussion 
and 
settlement 
(as 
far 
as 
man 
can 
settle 
them) 
of 
these 
lofty 
questions, 
and 
for 
an 
encounter 
with 
the 
hydra 
of 
a 
perverted 
speculation, 
which 
already 
shews 
signs 
of 
being 
within 
our 
borders, 
in 
the 
distorted 
theology 
of 
would-be 
metaphysical 
theologians, 
and 
in 
the 
atheism 
and 
socialismofourcorruptedmasses. 


We 
fear 
we 
may 
not 
have 
succeeded 
in 
rendering 
very 
intelligible, 
and 
far 
less 
in 
rendering 
attractive, 
the 
nature 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
most 
comprehensive 
question 
in 
philosophy. 
After 
any 
attempted 
statement 
of 
it, 
the 
consequent 
experience 
of 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
words 
of 
ordinary 
language 
for 
these 
refined 
purposes, 
must 
invest 
with 
interest 
the 
splendid 
project 
by 
Leibnitz 
himself 
of 
a 
universal 
language, 
of 
which 
the 
alphabet 
should 
indicate 
the 



few 
original 
ideas 
with 
which 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
our 
knowledge 
is 
connected; 
while 
overlooking, 
perhaps, 
the 
wide 
difference 
of 
the 
matter 
of 
metaphysical 
and 
mathematical 
science, 
he 
held 
that 
out 
of 
these 
simple 
characters 
formulas 
might 
be 
constructed, 
expressive 
of 
the 
various 
relations 
between 
thoughts, 
and 
that 
through 
them 
inferences 
might 
be 
deduced, 
with 
the 
same 
freedom 
from 
error, 
as 
by 
the 
processes 
of 
geometry 
and 
algebra. 
But 
we 
must 
leave 
for 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
reflecting 
reader 
the 
entire 
subject, 
so 
imperfectly 
touched 
upon 
in 
the 
preceding 
paragraphs, 
and 
return 
to 
the 
booksbeforeus. 


The 
philosophical 
works 
of 
Leibnitz 
are, 
in 
bulk, 
only 
a 
small 
part 
of 
the 
literary 
productions 
of 
a 
life 
devoted 
to 
almost 
the 
whole 
sphere 
of 
possible 
knowledge. 
Professor 
Erdmann 
has 
rendered 
good 
service 
to 
the 
thinking 
world 
by 
his 
edition 
(the 
most 
valuable 
of 
those 
referred 
to 
at 
the 
commencement 
of 
this 
Essay) 
of 
this 
class 
of 
the 
writings 
of 
the 
father 
of 
German 
speculation. 
While 
Leibnitz 
could 
on 
no 
subject 
write 
unphilosophically, 
yet 
there 
are 
sections 
of 
his 
works 
which 
may 
be 
extracted 
and 
combined 
for 
publication 
as 
more 
exclusively 
and 
profoundly 
philosophical, 
indicating 
not 
ripples, 
extended 
widely, 
perhaps, 
over 
the 
surface 
of 
thought, 
but 
the 
ocean-swell 
of 
an 
agitation 
that 
is 
far 
below. 
This 
department 
of 
his 
writings 
is 
scattered, 
without 
much 
attention 
to 
order, 
through 
the 
voluminous 
publication 
of 
Dutens, 
and 
is 
partly 
contained 
in 
the 
rare 
edition 
of 
his 
posthumous 
philosophical 
works 
by 
Raspe. 
Accordingly, 
while 
the 
life 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
an 
epoch 
in 
the 
history 
of 
speculation, 
his 
speculative 
writings 
have 
been 
seldom 
and 
superficially 
studied. 
Besides 
the 
materials 
collected 
in 
former 
editions, 
Professor 
Erdmann 
has 
enriched 
his 
republicationwith 
nofewer 
thantwenty-three 
originaldocumentsofLeibnitz, 
not 
before 
published, 
and 
which 
this 
able 
and 
industrious 
editor 
has 
recovered, 
during 
an 
active 
search 
in 
1836, 
among 
the 
accumulation 
of 



manuscripts 
in 
the 
Royal 
Library 
of 
Hanover. 
Most 
of 
these 
added 
works 
relate 
to 
that 
theme, 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
which 
we 
have 
already 
alluded 
to 
as 
the 
central 
one 
of 
the 
intellectual 
life 
of 
Leibnitz. 
It 
increases 
the 
convenience 
of 
this 
edition, 
that 
the 
several 
works 
which 
it 
includes, 
101 
in 
number, 
have 
been 
arranged, 
as 
nearly 
as 
possible, 
in 
the 
order 
in 
which 
they 
were 
written. 
Inthisextensivecollection,wearegladtorecognisethe 
Nouveaux 
Essais 
and 
the 
Théodicée. 


It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
give 
even 
a 
brief 
exposition 
of 
the 
very 
miscellaneous 
contents 
of 
these 
works. 
The 
system 
and 
manner 
of 
thinking 
of 
Leibnitz, 
is 
to 
be 
gathered 
from 
his 
philosophical 
works 
studied 
collectively, 
rather 
than 
from 
any 
separate 
publication. 
These 
collected 
writings 
bear 
throughout 
one 
very 
marked 
characteristic 
of 
inventive 
genius; 
for 
they 
are 
crowded 
with 
richly 
suggestive 
germs 
of 
thought, 
cast 
forth 
often 
in 
disorder, 
as 
it 
were 
with 
intent 
to 
exercise 
the 
generalizing 
powers 
of 
others. 
From 
out 
of 
this 
stimulating 
variety, 
there 
may, 
however, 
be 
extracted 
two 
or 
three 
more 
prominent 
ideas, 
united, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
by 
demonstration, 
with 
his 
assumed 
first 
principles; 
for 
the 
main 
purpose 
of 
this 
metaphysician 
was 
to 
give 
to 
philosophy 
a 
mathematical 
strictness 
and 
certainty, 
and 
to 
reconcile 
its 
doctrines 
with 
those 
of 
theology. 
The 
universe 
is 
contemplated 
by 
him 
in 
the 
threefold 
relation 
of 
— 
1. 
Its 
elements; 
2. 
Their 
manner 
of 
connexion; 
and, 
3. 
The 
end 
of 
their 
combination. 
The 
doctrine 
of 
elements, 
he 
calls 
monadologie.The 
mutualrelationsof 
these 
elements,heheld 
tobedeveloped 
in 
a 
pre-established 
harmony. 
The 
final 
end 
of 
creation, 
he 
represented 
as 
an 
optimism. 
Let 
us 
accompany 
him 
at 
a 
distance, 
as 
he 
is 
constructing 
this 
system 
of 
a 
priori 
universal 
philosophy, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
before 
us 
a 
specimen 
of 
a 
class 
of 
systems, 
foreign, 
indeed, 
to 
Britain, 
but 
which 
may 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
Eleatics, 
the 
Alexandrians, 
or 
Spinoza, 
in 
respectofits 
boldnessandcomprehension. 



Through 
experience, 
Leibnitz 
finds 
himself 
surrounded 
by 
compound 
or 
material 
bodies 
of 
amazing 
variety. 
This 
implies 
the 
existence 
of 
elements, 
of 
which 
these 
compounds 
are 
the 
results, 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
elements 
is 
to 
be 
ascertained 
according 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
thought. 
An 
application 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
Sufficient 
Reason, 
demonstrates 
that 
matter 
can 
consist 
neither 
of 
parts 
which 
are 
infinitely 
divisible, 
nor 
of 
atoms 
possessed 
of 
figure 
and 
extension. 
Its 
elements 
must, 
therefore, 
be 
simple, 
unextended 
forces, 
or 
Monads, 
in 
which 
we 
obtain 
the 
a 
priori 
idea 
of 
substance. 
The 
individuality 
of 
these 
monads 
must 
consist 
in 
the 
different 
series 
of 
internal 
changes 
through 
which 
each 
one 
passes 
in 
the 
course 
of 
its 
existence. 
In 
these 
series, 
each 
successive 
change 
is 
termed 
a 
Perception, 
and 
every 
monad 
is 
a 
living 
mirror, 
giving 
forth, 
after 
its 
own 
fashion, 
a 
picture 
of 
the 
universe, 
which 
is 
thusone 
vast 
collection 
of 
spiritualforces. 
These 
necessaryelements 
of 
all 
concrete 
existence 
cannot 
all 
be 
reduced 
to 
one 
class 
or 
order, 
for 
they 
are 
distinguished 
by 
different 
degrees 
of 
perception 
and 
active 
power. 
Some 
are 
destitute 
of 
conscious 
perception, 
and 
these 
are 
the 
elements 
of 
which 
the 
material 
world 
is 
the 
result. 
Then 
there 
is 
the 
animating 
principle 
of 
the 
lower 
animals. 
There 
are 
also 
the 
self-conscious 
souls 
of 
men, 
containing 
in 
themselves 
the 
fountains 
of 
necessary 
truth. 
And 
these 
three 
classes 
of 
created 
forces 
or 
substances 
must 
have 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
their 
existence. 
There 
cannot 
be 
an 
infinite 
series 
of 
contingents, 
and, 
if 
there 
could, 
the 
final 
reason 
even 
of 
such 
an 
infinite 
series 
could 
be 
found 
only 
in 
a 
necessary 
substance. 
Creation 
must 
thus 
involve 
the 
existence 
of 
One 
Supreme 
infinite, 
the 
monas 
monadum, 
from 
whom 
all 
that 
is 
finite 
has 
been 
derived, 
and 
in 
whose 
existence 
it 
finds 
its 
complete 
explanation. 
This 
Supreme 
Substance 
is 
God. 
He 
is 
the 
fountain 
of 
all 
reality. 
The 
attributes 
of 
the 
created 
monads, 
as 
far 
as 
they 
are 
perfect, 
result 
from 
the 
perfection 
of 
God; 
as 
far 
as 
they 
are 
imperfect,fromthenecessaryimperfection 
ofthecreature. 



Having 
in 
these 
conclusions, 
as 
he 
conceived, 
demonstratively 
refunded 
concrete 
being 
into 
its 
elements, 
and 
related 
all 
created 
elements 
to 
the 
One 
uncreated 
and 
supreme, 
Leibnitz 
would 
next 
find 
the 
mutual 
relations 
of 
the 
several 
elementary 
forces 
of 
creation. 
Although 
the 
monads 
have 
neither 
figure 
nor 
extension 
in 
themselves, 
their 
co-existence 
and 
relations 
sufficiently 
account 
for 
the 
phenomena 
of 
extension, 
duration, 
and 
body. 
Space 
and 
Time 
have 
thus 
merely 
an 
ideal 
and 
relative 
existence. 
They 
result 
from 
the 
relation 
of 
monads, 
considered 
as 
co-existing 
or 
in 
succession; 
and 
are 
simply 
modes 
in 
which 
we 
regard 
the 
objects 
of 
our 
experience. 
Further, 
the 
elements 
of 
creation 
being 
absolutely 
destitute 
of 
parts 
and 
extension, 
cannot 
mutually 
influence 
one 
another. 
Inter-causation 
is 
thus 
excluded 
from 
the 
real 
universe, 
and 
is 
confined 
to 
the 
phenomenal, 
which 
is 
governed 
by 
mechanical 
law. 
Yet 
the 
universe 
is 
ideally 
related 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
God, 
and 
of 
each 
creature, 
in 
proportion 
as 
his 
ideas 
approximate 
to 
the 
Divine. 
God, 
“in 
the 
beginning,” 
launched 
the 
elements 
into 
being, 
having 
resolved 
for 
each 
one 
a 
determinate 
history 
throughout 
eternity, 
and 
a 
history 
which 
should 
harmonize 
with 
that 
of 
every 
other. 
This 
mutual 
relation 
is 
beautifully 
illustrated, 
when 
we 
are 
told 
that 
from 
the 
given 
state 
of 
any 
monad 
at 
any 
time, 
the 
Eternal 
Geometer 
can 
find 
the 
state 
of 
the 
universe 
past, 
present, 
and 
to 
come. 
In 
the 
attributes 
of 
the 
Uncreated 
and 
Supreme, 
is 
to 
be 
found 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
a 
Pre-established 
Harmony 
in 
all 
that 
He 
has 
made. 
This 
explains 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
changes 
of 
creation. 
The 
apparent 
action 
of 
finite 
monads 
upon 
each 
other, 
is 
really 
the 
result 
of 
that 
original 
harmonious 
arrangement 
of 
God, 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
He 
secures, 
without 
fail, 
those 
ends 
which 
He 
contemplated 
when 
the 
universe 
issued 
from 
his 
hands. 
The 
phenomena 
attendant 
on 
that 
fruitful 
theme 
of 
philosophical 
disputation, 
the 
union 
of 
soul 
and 
body, 
— 
of 
the 
self-conscious 
monad 
and 
the 
related 
monads 
of 
an 
inferior 
order, 
— 
are 
counted 
capable 
of 
explanation 
on 
the 



same 
general 
principle. 
The 
successive 
changes 
of 
the 
soul 
must 
exactly 
tally 
with 
those 
of 
the 
body; 
yet 
without 
any 
mutual 
action. 
They 
are 
related 
as 
two 
clocks, 
of 
which 
the 
one 
points 
to 
the 
hour 
exactly 
as 
the 
other 
strikes; 
or 
as 
separate 
parts 
of 
the 
same 
clock, 
— 
for 
Leibnitz 
likens 
the 
whole 
universe 
to 
a 
timepiece 
which 
was 
wound 
up 
in 
the 
act 
of 
creation, 
and 
which 
thenceforward 
pursues 
its 
own 
movements 
harmoniously 
for 
ever. 
Mind 
and 
matter 
— 
the 
realm 
of 
final 
causes, 
and 
the 
realm 
of 
efficient 
causes 
— 
are 
thus 
in 
necessary 
harmony. 
And 
a 
like 
harmony 
must 
obtain 
between 
reason 
and 
religiousfaith 
— 
thekingdomofnature,andthe 
cityof 
God. 


This 
last 
harmony 
links 
the 
theological 
with 
the 
merely 
philosophical 
part 
of 
the 
system 
of 
Leibnitz; 
and 
introduces 
us 
to 
his 
philosophy 
of 
religion. 
A 
question 
may 
be 
asked, 
— 
If 
the 
universe 
— 
moral 
as 
well 
as 
physical 
— 
is 
a 
self-regulating 
machine, 
is 
not 
the 
Creator 
seemingly 
excluded 
from 
the 
government 
of 
His 
creation; 
and, 
if 
not 
thus 
excluded, 
how 
is 
He 
related 
to 
the 
sin 
and 
misery 
which 
it 
contains? 
That 
the 
apparent 
manner 
of 
His 
relations 
to 
the 
creation 
should 
be 
what 
it 
is, 
results, 
he 
thinks, 
from 
our 
relative 
knowledge, 
which 
can 
never 
rise 
superior 
to 
the 
condition 
of 
time. 
In 
reality, 
this 
pre-established 
harmony 
is 
a 
revelation 
of 
the 
Divine 
perfection 
in 
a 
scheme 
of 
Optimism. 
Every 
possible 
universe 
was, 
from 
eternity, 
conceived 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
God. 
One 
of 
these 
only 
can 
be 
translated 
from 
possible 
into 
actual 
existence, 
and 
that 
one 
must 
be 
the 
best. 
There 
is, 
indeed, 
included 
in 
it 
moral 
and 
natural 
evil, 
— 
the 
latter 
the 
harmonious 
consequent 
of 
the 
former, 
and 
a 
reaction 
against 
it. 
But 
moral 
evil 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
the 
best 
of 
possible 
universes, 
and 
the 
will 
of 
God 
is 
not 
the 
fountain 
of 
necessary 
truths. 
The 
mystery 
of 
sin 
is 
not 
to 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
resolution 
of 
evil 
into 
good, 
for 
sin 
is 
essentially 
evil. 
But 
sin 
is 
necessarily 
involved 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
this 
best 
of 
possible 
universes, 
which, 
notwithstanding 
its 
evil, 
it 
is 
better 
to 
translate 
out 
of 
the 
possible 
into 
the 
actual, 
than 
to 
have 
no 



universe 
at 
all. 
Thus, 
the 
created 
universe 
must 
be 
the 
harmony 
of 
one 
great 
Theocracy, 
expressive 
of 
the 
attributes 
of 
the 
one 
Perfect 
Being. 
From 
His 
eternal 
throne, 
its 
several 
streams 
of 
elementary 
existence 
must 
have 
taken 
their 
rise. 
They 
have 
flowed, 
and 
they 
must 
continue 
to 
flow, 
in 
the 
courses 
into 
which 
he 
sent 
them 
in 
the 
beginning; 
and, 
notwithstanding 
the 
dark 
shades 
in 
which 
so 
many 
of 
them 
are 
enveloped, 
they 
are 
recognised 
by 
His 
Omniscience 
as 
the 
only 
possible 
and 
therefore 
most 
glorious 
illustration, 
by 
creation,ofthepurefountainwhencetheyhave 
originated. 


If 
illusory, 
these 
are, 
at 
least, 
splendid 
speculations. 
There 
are 
two 
modes 
of 
thus 
rising 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
imagination 
in 
a 
philosophy 
of 
the 
universe. 
We 
may 
follow 
the 
course 
of 
the 
modern 
astronomy; 
or, 
we 
may 
meditate 
on 
the 
facts 
of 
metaphysics 
and 
speculative 
theology. 
He 
who 
studies 
the 
one, 
gazes 
on 
the 
starry 
heavens 
and 
ranges 
in 
thought 
over 
the 
distant 
parts 
of 
material 
creation, 
till, 
lost 
in 
what 
he 
observes, 
his 
astronomy 
seems 
merged 
in 
idealism. 
The 
votary 
of 
speculation, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
taking 
in 
the 
spiritual 
as 
well 
as 
the 
material 
world, 
contemplates 
the 
Human 
and 
the 
Divine; 
and 
with 
faculties 
fitted 
to 
judge 
only 
of 
successive 
and 
contemporaneous 
nature, 
meets 
the 
mysteries 
of 
an 
objective 
world, 
of 
personality 
and 
free-will, 
and 
of 
the 
Divine 
existence, 
and 
seems, 
also, 
lost 
in 
that 
world 
of 
ideas, 
where 
physical 
and 
metaphysical 
science 
thus 
appear 
to 
converge. 


By 
these 
assumed 
demonstrations, 
of 
which 
we 
have 
given 
a 
very 
vague 
outline,Leibnitzhoped 
todelivermetaphysical 
science 
fromfutureerrorsand 
controversies, 
and 
to 
lead 
the 
way 
to 
a 
universal 
peace, 
in 
which 
Reason 
should 
be 
harmonized 
with 
Religion. 
Whatever 
we 
may 
say 
of 
the 
truth 
or 
falsehood 
of 
the 
doctrines 
to 
which 
he 
attained, 
we 
cannot 
withhold 
our 
homage 
of 
admiration 
when 
we 
reflect 
on 
such 
an 
amount 
of 
speculative 
genius 
in 
busy 
operation 
throughout 
a 
long 
life, 
— 
on 
the 
amazing 
sweep 
of 



the 
abstract 
conceptions 
which 
that 
genius 
has 
employed, 
— 
on 
that 
strong 
logical 
faith 
in 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
deduction, 
— 
on 
the 
richly 
suggestive 
ideas 
which 
this 
mighty 
thinker 
has 
contributed 
to 
philosophy, 
— 
and, 
on 
the 
unity 
of 
a 
system 
which 
sublimely 
designs 
to 
harmonize 
the 
spiritual 
with 
the 
sensibleworld. 


Leibnitz 
formed 
scholars, 
rather 
than 
a 
school. 
His 
system 
is 
essentially 
an 
eclectic 
one, 
and 
the 
whole 
tendency 
of 
his 
mind 
was 
opposed 
to 
merely 
national 
and 
sectarian 
distinctions, 
against 
which 
the 
extreme 
comprehensiveness 
of 
his 
genius 
gave 
him 
an 
instinctive 
repugnance, 
while 
his 
own 
fruitful 
mind 
rendered 
the 
most 
obscure 
system 
suggestive, 
and 
therefore 
worthy 
of 
being 
regarded 
with 
favourable 
indulgence. 
His 
sanguine 
spirit 
delights 
to 
discern 
a 
progress 
in 
the 
retrospect 
of 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
philosophy. 
In 
the 
early 
eastern 
systems, 
he 
finds 
noble 
ideas 
of 
God 
and 
the 
universe. 
In 
Greece 
he 
sees 
these 
reduced 
to 
a 
dialectic 
form. 
The 
early 
fathers 
appear 
to 
him 
to 
cast 
aside 
the 
corruptions 
of 
the 
Greek 
philosophy, 
while 
the 
schoolmen 
employ 
it 
in 
the 
service 
of 
Christianity. 
In 
modern 
times 
philosophy 
has 
become 
more 
free 
and 
ardent, 
and 
better 
directed 
than 
ever, 
and 
would, 
he 
thinks, 
be 
more 
successful 
than 
it 
has 
been, 
but 
for 
the 
evil 
spiritofsectarianism. 


“There 
is 
only 
one 
permitted 
sect 
of 
all,” 
says 
Leibnitz, 
“the 
sect 
of 
searchers 
after 
truth. 
The 
Aristotelians 
and 
Cartesians 
fail, 
not 
for 
want 
of 
talent, 
but 
because 
of 
their 
sectarianism. 
The 
imagination, 
which 
has 
been 
long 
under 
the 
spell 
of 
a 
single 
melody, 
cannot 
readily 
listen 
to 
another. 
He 
who 
has 
for 
years 
travelled 
the 
same 
beaten 
track, 
becomes 
unobservant 
of 
the 
surrounding 
scenes. 
Just 
so, 
those 
who 
have 
formed 
a 
habit 
of 
subordination 
to 
a 
single 
mind, 
are 
disqualified 
for 
the 
hopeful 
exercise 
of 
theirown.” 



Such 
was 
the 
spirit 
of 
Leibnitz; 
yet, 
probably 
the 
prevailing 
impression 
on 
the 
minds 
of 
any 
who 
have 
studied 
his 
writings, 
is 
a 
feeling 
of 
the 
remarkable 
contrast 
between 
the 
splendid 
intellectual 
exertions 
and 
enormous 
learning 
of 
this 
philosopher 
(combined 
as 
these 
are 
in 
him 
to 
an 
unprecedented 
degree), 
and 
the 
small 
positive 
contributions 
he 
has 
made 
to 
the 
register 
of 
permanently 
recognised 
truths. 
The 
vastness 
of 
his 
general 
principles 
occasions 
a 
corresponding 
vagueness 
in 
the 
rules 
for 
their 
application. 
They 
extend 
so 
widely 
as 
to 
comprehend 
only 
a 
few 
of 
the 
qualities 
of 
each 
of 
the 
objects 
that 
they 
include. 
The 
fact 
is, 
they 
reached 
too 
far 
to 
become 
at 
once 
familiar 
to 
the 
minds 
of 
men. 
The 
real 
spirit 
of 
the 
Leibnitzian 
philosophy 
slumbered 
for 
more 
than 
half 
a 
century, 
during 
which 
his 
nominal 
scholars 
under 
Wolff 
were 
starving 
on 
the 
subtleties 
of 
a 
severe 
yet 
profitless 
dialectic, 
and 
were 
evincing 
that 
dislike 
for 
really 
vigorous 
thought 
which 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
pedantry 
of 
an 
empty 
imposing 
philosophical 
nomenclature. 
In 
this 
period, 
the 
earlier 
Teutonic 
metaphysics 
perished 
as 
a 
System, 
to 
revive 
as 
a 
Spirit 
in 
the 
later 
German 
philosophy, 
and 
then 
to 
develop 
fully 
that 
germ, 
in 
the 
earlier 
system, 
of 
a 
perverted 
speculative 
idealism, 
which 
has 
shewn 
itself 
incompetent 
to 
realize 
in 
its 
expositions 
that 
positive 
adjustmentformysteries 
towhich 
itaspires. 


It 
is 
impossible 
here 
to 
plunge 
into 
the 
depths 
to 
which 
a 
formal 
criticism 
of 
this 
philosophy 
would 
conduct 
us, 
implying, 
as 
such 
a 
criticism 
would 
do, 
a 
full 
determination 
of 
the 
province 
of 
a 
priori 
reasoning 
in 
its 
relation 
to 
the 
facts 
of 
experience. 
The 
practised 
eye 
must 
have 
observed 
a 
connexion 
with 
many 
earlier 
and 
later 
schemes 
of 
a 
kindred 
description, 
even 
in 
the 
rough 
outlineof 
itwehavenowgiven. 


The 
attentive 
student, 
of 
the 
sketch 
which 
we 
have 
attempted, 
has 
perhaps 
already 
recognised 
in 
the 
central 
principle 
of 
this 
system 
of 
universal 
philosophy, 
a 
relation 
to 
one 
of 
the 
cardinal 
questions 
of 
metaphysical 



science, 
and 
a 
curious 
coincidence 
in 
the 
history 
of 
philosophy. 
By 
his 
subtle 
process 
of 
reasoning, 
Leibnitz 
virtually 
excludes 
the 
possibility 
of 
an 
external 
world. 
The 
last 
result 
of 
his 
analysis 
is 
a 
created 
aggregate 
of 
unextended 
spiritual 
forces, 
of 
various 
orders, 
and 
of 
which 
the 
mutual 
relations, 
as 
collocated 
inbodies,originatethephenomenaof 
the 
visiblecreation. 


While 
the 
author 
of 
the 
Monadologie 
was 
in 
this 
manner 
resolving 
all 
creation 
into 
immaterial 
elements, 
a 
philosopher 
of 
another 
country, 
and 
of 
a 
different 
school, 
was 
approaching, 
perhaps 
more 
consciously, 
to 
a 
similar 
conclusion 
by 
a 
different 
course. 
Trained 
in 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Bacon 
and 
Locke, 
but 
receiving 
them 
into 
a 
soul 
that 
delighted 
to 
hold 
converse 
with 
Plato, 
and 
ignorant 
of 
the 
high 
questions 
agitated 
in 
Germany 
by 
his 
contemporary, 
he 
deduced 
from 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
English 
philosophy 
a 
system 
of 
idealism, 
which, 
besides 
its 
seductions 
for 
theimagination, 
is 
urged 
in 
a 
spirit 
and 
for 
a 
purpose 
that 
must 
ever 
render 
venerable 
among 
Christians, 
as 
well 
as 
illustrious 
among 
metaphysicians, 
the 
name 
of 
Berkeley, 
Bishop 
of 
Cloyne. 
His 
well-known 
“Dialogues” 
are, 
to 
many 
minds, 
perhaps 
the 
mostattractive 
display 
of 
metaphysical 
doctrine 
which 
the 
English 
language 
contains. 
This 
philosopher 
is, 
moreover, 
worthy 
of 
notice 
for 
more 
than 
even 
his 
elegant 
fancy, 
and 
refined 
discussion, 
and 
graceful 
diction. 
The 
scenes 
and 
music 
of 
material 
nature, 
which 
have 
infused 
so 
much 
poetry 
into 
his 
writings, 
and 
which 
he 
would 
connect 
with 
something 
less 
gross 
than 
the 
cumbrous 
apparatus 
of 
an 
external 
world, 
are 
all 
regarded 
by 
Berkeley 
as 
direct 
manifestations 
of 
God. 
With 
this 
Christian 
philosopher, 
visible 
nature 
is 
not 
an 
aggregate 
of 
merely 
unconscious 
substances 
— 
the 
refuge 
of 
atheism 
and 
materialism 
— 
the 
veil 
by 
which 
God 
is 
concealed 
from 
man, 
and 
then 
banished 
from 
his 
thoughts. 
In 
the 
seeming 
solitude 
of 
idealism, 
he 
finds 
himself 
in 
the 
immediate 
presence 
of 
the 
“Father 
of 
Spirits,” 
in 
whomwethus 
literally 
“live, 
andmove,andhaveourbeing.” 



Thus, 
at 
the 
commencement 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century, 
there 
were 
two 
philosophers, 
representing 
the 
two 
opposed 
schools 
of 
philosophy, 
whose 
speculations 
conducted 
them 
to 
immaterialism. 
The 
“demonstrative 
metaphysic” 
of 
Leibnitz 
has 
parted 
with 
body 
and 
extension 
before 
it 
has 
resolved 
nature 
into 
its 
elements. 
The 
experimental 
philosophy 
of 
Berkeley 
fails 
to 
extract 
from 
the 
phenomena 
of 
perception 
the 
evidence 
of 
a 
substance 
differentin 
kindfromtheself-consciousspiritwhichperceivesthem. 


Since, 
as 
well 
as 
before 
the 
epoch 
of 
Leibnitz 
and 
Berkeley, 
that 
vast 
group 
of 
phenomena 
commonly 
designated 
material, 
and 
which 
are 
so 
nearly 
connected 
with 
life 
in 
this 
“middle 
state,” 
has 
occasioned 
much 
speculation. 
The 
defence 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
essential 
distinction 
of 
mind 
and 
matter, 
has 
hitherto 
been 
a 
characteristic 
of 
the 
national 
philosophy 
of 
Scotland. 
That 
philosophy 
has 
to 
encounter 
the 
opposition 
of 
three 
contrary 
idealistic 
hypotheses, 
according 
to 
one 
of 
which 
all 
created 
existence 
is 
resolved, 
with 
Leibnitz, 
into 
spiritual 
substances 
of 
different 
orders, 
and 
material 
phenomena 
are 
regarded 
as 
merely 
resulting 
from 
these 
immaterial 
elements 


— 
according 
to 
a 
second, 
the 
material 
world 
is 
conceived 
as 
a 
series 
of 
ideas 
produced 
immediately 
and 
in 
regular 
order 
by 
God 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
men 
— 
according 
to 
a 
third, 
as 
a 
group 
of 
the 
phenomena 
of 
our 
own 
minds, 
regulated 
by 
an 
unknown 
principle. 
The 
adjustment 
of 
the 
long-agitated 
controversy 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
Matter 
is 
of 
practical 
importance, 
chiefly 
as 
it 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
refutation 
of 
scepticism. 
There 
surely 
remains 
room 
for 
a 
better-defined 
settlement 
of 
the 
actual 
evidence 
of 
consciousness 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
subject 
which, 
in 
all 
ages, 
has 
tended 
to 
excite 
speculation, 
and 
which, 
since 
the 
time 
of 
Berkeley, 
has 
been 
regarded 
by 
acute 
minds 
as, 
at 
least,an 
“openquestion” 
inmetaphysicalscience. 
The 
most 
important 
service, 
however, 
which 
its 
author 
hoped 
to 
render 
by 
his 
System 
of 
Monads, 
relates 
to 
the 
refutation 
of 
Pantheism. 
The 



Monadologie, 
with 
the 
consequent 
doctrines, 
is 
essentially 
an 
effort 
to 
indicate 
the 
metaphysical 
and 
moral 
relations 
of 
the 
Divine 
Being 
with 
the 
universe. 
Antagonist 
to 
the 
Cartesian 
hypothesis 
of 
occasional 
causes, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
a 
pre-established 
harmony 
has 
been 
accused 
of 
tending 
to 
an 
atheistic 
separation 
of 
the 
world 
from 
God, 
while 
the 
rival 
system 
has 
been 
counted 
open 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
an 
identification 
of 
the 
creature 
and 
the 
Creator, 
of 
which 
there 
are 
signs 
in 
the 
system 
of 
Malebranche, 
and 
which 
was 
fully 
developed 
in 
the 
Ethics 
of 
Spinoza. 
We 
are 
unable 
to 
undertake 
an 
elaborate 
discussion 
of 
a 
subject 
so 
profound 
and 
complicated 
as 
the 
one 
suggested 
by 
these 
speculations 
— 
a 
discussion 
which 
requires 
a 
previous 
settlement 
of 
the 
limits 
and 
canons 
of 
metaphysical 
reasoning 
— 
and 
we 
would 
conclude 
this 
Essay 
with 
some 
allusion 
to 
that 
awful 
frontier 
land, 
where 
religion 
becomes 
blended 
with 
the 
higher 
philosophy, 
and 
where 
objects 
have 
been 
found 
fitted 
to 
attract 
educated 
and 
uneducated 
minds 
in 
all 
agesof 
the 
world. 


Leibnitz, 
as 
we 
have 
seen, 
was 
led 
by 
his 
love 
of 
speculation, 
and 
also 
by 
a 
desireto 
repelthe 
scepticalobjections 
ofBayle,toconsiderthemuch-vexed 
question 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
evil. 
It 
might 
be 
made 
evident, 
if 
we 
are 
not 
mistaken, 
that, 
in 
his 
attempt 
to 
reconcile 
the 
dismal 
phenomena 
of 
our 
own 
actual 
experience 
with 
what 
is 
discovered 
from 
other 
sources 
of 
the 
character 
of 
God, 
we 
have 
a 
fit 
illustration 
of 
the 
inapplicability, 
for 
purposes 
of 
useful 
effect, 
of 
principles 
so 
extremely 
general 
as 
those 
with 
which 
he 
was 
accustomed 
to 
deal. 
We 
frequently 
observe 
also 
an 
indistinct 
apprehension, 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
philosopher, 
of 
the 
line 
by 
which, 
in 
these 
matters, 
positive 
is 
separated 
fromnegativeknowledge. 


There 
must 
be 
mysteries 
in 
a 
science 
like 
theology, 
which 
includes 
among 
its 
principal 
objects, 
the 
nature 
and 
attributes 
of 
God, 
as 
related 
to 
a 
class 
of 
responsible 
created 
agents. 
An 
important 
step 
of 
progress 
has 
been 
gained, 



when 
what 
is 
incognizable 
is 
treated 
as 
an 
acknowledged 
mystery. 
Much 
needs 
still 
to 
be 
done 
to 
spread 
the 
spirit, 
and 
secure 
the 
right 
application 
of 
this 
principle. 
The 
region 
of 
a 
new 
science, 
or 
at 
least 
of 
a 
wider 
and 
better 
application 
of 
metaphysical 
and 
also 
of 
logical 
science, 
seems 
to 
open 
before 
us, 
when 
we 
contemplate 
in 
their 
connexion 
the 
series 
of 
events 
which 
pervade 
natural 
and 
supernatural 
theology, 
regarded 
as 
the 
science 
of 
the 
mutualrelations 
ofGodandman. 


The 
primary 
truth 
of 
theology 
demands 
the 
exercise 
of 
philosophical 
faith. 
The 
finite 
mind 
cannot 
grasp 
the 
full 
conception 
of 
the 
co-existence 
of 
a 
responsible 
creature 
with 
the 
infinite 
Creator. 
The 
existence 
of 
a 
moral 
creation 
isafactwhichmancannotexplain. 
Hefindsinhimselftherelicsofa 
Law 
impressed 
on 
him 
when 
he 
was 
created 
“in 
the 
image 
of 
God,” 
which 
tells 
of 
duty 
and 
demands 
obedience; 
and 
this 
gives 
evidence 
that 
man 
was 
created 
to 
be 
governed 
by, 
and 
so 
was 
taken 
into 
a 
moral 
relation 
with, 
a 
personal 
God. 
He 
finds 
himself 
a 
dependent 
and 
yet 
a 
moral 
agent, 
responsible 
for 
his 
manner 
of 
acting 
towards 
Him 
from 
whom 
he 
received 
the 
power 
to 
act. 
This 
combination 
of 
freedom 
with 
derived 
and 
dependent 
agency, 
includes 
something 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
human 
faculties. 
An 
anchor 
is 
needed, 
by 
which 
the 
understanding 
may 
be 
kept 
back, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
from 
a 
Pantheistic 
absorption 
of 
the 
moral 
creation 
in 
the 
Creator, 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
from 
suffering 
the 
universe 
to 
be 
cast 
adrift 
on 
the 
dreary 
ocean 
of 
Atheism; 
and 
it 
is 
found 
in 
the 
faith 
which 
believes 
what 
it 
can 
neither 
question 
nor 
fully 
comprehend. 


The 
evolution 
of 
the 
theological 
system 
is 
a 
further 
evolution 
of 
the 
mystery 
into 
which 
its 
first 
principle 
retires. 
As 
the 
understanding 
cannot 
embrace 
a 
reconciliation 
of 
the 
infinity 
of 
the 
divine 
attributes 
with 
the 
creation 
of 
beings 
free 
to 
act, 
and 
therefore 
responsible, 
neither 
can 
it 
devise 
a 
scheme 
for 
harmonizing 
with 
these 
attributes 
the 
dark 
history 
of 
a 
portion 



of 
that 
created 
agency. 
We 
find 
that 
each 
member 
of 
our 
own 
race 
is 
born 
into 
the 
world 
“alienated” 
from 
God, 
and 
we 
are 
told 
of 
another 
race 
that 
has 
fallen, 
without 
hope 
of 
recovery, 
into 
the 
same 
awful 
habit 
of 
ungodliness. 
The 
continued 
existence 
of 
moral 
creatures 
in 
the 
universe 
has 
thus 
added 
another 
inexplicable 
phenomenon 
to 
the 
mystery 
of 
their 
original 
creation. 
Sin 
has 
appeared. 
Responsible 
creatures 
have 
become 
rebels 
against 
the 
law 
of 
Him 
from 
whom 
their 
responsibility 
was 
derived. 
The 
stream 
which, 
in 
the 
creating 
act, 
was 
seen 
to 
issue 
from 
impenetrable 
recesses, 
here 
resumes 
its 
subterranean 
channel, 
andwhenitreappears,hasbecomestrangelyaltered. 


There 
is 
a 
third 
evolution 
of 
the 
mystery 
which 
pervades 
theology. 
God 
Himself 
has 
spoken 
to 
us 
of 
an 
extraordinary 
plan 
of 
restoration, 
of 
which 
the 
operation 
becomes 
apparent 
to 
us 
when 
the 
“alienated” 
are 
“reconciled.” 
The 
created 
agent 
had 
carried 
his 
responsibility 
through 
the 
course 
of 
the 
original 
estrangement, 
and 
his 
responsibility 
is 
continued 
through 
the 
subsequent 
course 
of 
restoration. 
Yet 
the 
subjective 
process 
of 
estrangement 
commences 
with 
his 
birth, 
and 
the 
subjective 
process 
of 
reunion 
is 
conducted 
by 
the 
present 
living 
agency 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit. 
The 
phenomena 
of 
restoration 
in 
the 
spiritual 
world, 
displayed 
in 
the 
Church 
of 
God, 
thus, 
like 
the 
two 
preceding 
classes 
of 
related 
phenomena, 
rise 
out 
of 
a 
region 
into 
which 
the 
eye 
of 
the 
humanunderstanding 
cannotpenetrate. 


A 
series 
of 
strange 
facts 
is 
unfolded 
in 
the 
history 
of 
this 
corner 
of 
the 
universe. 
Creation, 
sin, 
and 
salvation 
— 
the 
unfallen, 
the 
fallen, 
and 
the 
restored 
moral 
creature 
— 
are 
revealed 
to 
us 
in 
events 
which 
we 
may 
know, 
while 
each 
seems 
to 
emerge 
directly 
from 
an 
abyss 
whose 
depths 
we 
cannot 
fathom. 
Their 
appearance 
has 
been 
the 
signal 
for 
those 
controversies 
of 
theologians 
which 
have 
been 
carried 
on, 
and 
those 
battles 
of 
faith 
with 
scepticism 
which 
have 
been 
fought, 
for 
almost 
six 
thousand 
years. 
In 
the 
revealed 
fact 
of 
creation, 
we 
find 
the 
germ 
of 
the 
questions 
of 
Pantheism 
and 



Free-will. 
The 
existence 
of 
sin 
has 
suggested 
the 
hypotheses 
of 
Manichaeism 
and 
Optimism. 
The 
phenomena 
of 
restoration 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Election 
and 
Grace, 
and 
their 
proposed 
modifications, 
and 
with 
therevealedprospects 
ofthemoralcreationthroughouteternity. 


It 
is 
ethically 
important 
that 
the 
mind 
should 
become 
familiar 
with 
the 
general 
character 
of 
that 
associated 
group 
of 
theological 
truths 
which 
demands 
the 
exercise 
of 
philosophical 
faith, 
and 
therefore 
falls 
within 
the 
range 
of 
what 
has 
to 
be 
considered, 
and 
somehow 
disposed 
of, 
in 
a 
complete 
system 
of 
metaphysical 
philosophy. 
That 
religion 
must 
be 
pervaded 
by 
this 
series 
of 
mysteries 
which 
we 
have 
endeavoured 
to 
trace, 
is 
a 
principle 
of 
which 
the 
cordial 
reception 
should 
moderate 
our 
polemical 
ardour 
with 
reference 
to 
all 
in 
theology 
that 
is 
merely 
human 
opinion, 
and 
conduct 
us 
“as 
little 
children” 
to 
that 
practical 
solution 
of 
them 
all, 
which 
is 
opened 
to 
the 
soul 
that 
has 
become 
“willing 
to 
do” 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
History, 
which 
has 
to 
record 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
moral 
disorder 
of 
man, 
bears 
the 
record 
of 
other 
irregularities, 
and 
that 
even 
in 
the 
series 
of 
natural 
phenomena. 
It 
gives 
evidence 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
One 
who 
died 
and 
rose 
again, 
and 
whose 
miracles, 
insoluble 
by 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
physical 
creation, 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
laws 
and 
harmony 
of 
a 
higher 
economy. 
As 
the 
grand 
credentials 
of 
a 
revelation 
from 
God, 
addressed 
to 
a 
fallen 
race, 
and 
which 
contains 
an 
account 
of 
the 
origin 
and 
cure 
of 
its 
disorders, 
sufficient 
to 
satisfy 
and 
stimulate 
a 
reviving 
conscience, 
they 
are 
fitted 
to 
elevate 
thought, 
from 
the 
world 
of 
sense 
in 
which 
they 
have 
been 
manifested, 
to 
man 
and 
man’s 
prospects 
in 
that 
moral 
and 
spiritual 
world 
which 
we 
here 
“see 
through 
a 
glassdarkly” 
in 
thereflectionof 
areality 
thatis 
not 
yet 
initselfrevealed. 


Thus 
has 
God 
sufficiently 
provided 
us 
with 
a 
practical 
solution 
for 
the 
mysteries 
of 
theology. 
Conversant, 
as 
we 
ought 
to 
be, 
with 
what 
is 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
sensible 
experience, 
and 
incapable 
of 
comprehension 
by 



faculties 
created 
for 
comprehending 
only 
the 
events 
of 
contemporaneous 
and 
successive 
nature, 
we 
may 
yet 
learn, 
through 
experience 
itself, 
that 
religious 
faith 
in 
the 
miraculously 
revealed 
law 
of 
grace 
finds 
the 
needed 
harmony 
of 
what 
by 
us 
is 
incomprehensible 
— 
a 
harmony 
in 
which 
the 
conscience 
does 
the 
work 
that 
cannot 
be 
devolved 
upon 
the 
intellect, 
and 
in 
which 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
character 
is 
found 
a 
sure 
path 
to 
the 
sufficient 
knowledge 
of 
the 
doctrine. 
The 
mysteries 
of 
nature 
and 
reason 
thus 
cease 
to 
hinderthegradualrestorationoftheregenerate 
totheimageofGod. 


The 
preceding 
notices 
and 
reflections 
have 
accumulated 
so 
much 
beyond 
our 
expectation, 
that 
we 
must 
not 
extend 
our 
limits 
beyond 
this 
point, 
from 
which 
we 
may 
look 
at 
a 
distance, 
with 
awe 
and 
profit, 
upon 
the 
host 
of 
speculative 
questions 
which 
the 
writings 
of 
Leibnitz 
are 
evidently 
fitted 
to 
raise. 
Our 
end 
has 
been 
gained, 
if 
what 
we 
have 
written 
leads 
any 
to 
benefit 
by 
sympathy 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
spirit 
of 
a 
famous 
metaphysician 
and 
metaphysical 
theologian 
— 
to 
refresh 
and 
elevate 
their 
minds 
by 
the 
meditative 
study 
of 
his 
works 
— 
and 
to 
be 
warned 
of 
the 
still 
prevalent 
illusions 
which 
carried 
him 
captive, 
and, 
seeming 
to 
gain 
strength 
and 
courage 
from 
the 
victory, 
have 
carried 
captive 
the 
succeeding 
generations 
of 
German 
speculators. 
These 
lessons 
are 
needed 
in 
an 
age 
in 
which 
there 
are 
signs 
that 
the 
revival 
of 
old 
controversies, 
and 
the 
rise 
of 
new 
ones, 
— 
many 
of 
them 
not 
remotely 
connected 
with 
these 
illusory 
habits 
of 
thought, 
— 
are 
about 
to 
surprise 
a 
generation 
ill 
fitted 
to 
deal 
with 
abstract 
speculation. 
We 
love 
to 
anticipate 
a 
future 
history 
of 
Metaphysics 
and 
Theology 
in 
this 
country 
more 
encouraging 
than 
these 
omens 
seem 
to 
forebode; 
and 
to 
have 
disclosed 
before 
us 
in 
imagination, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
succeeding 
age, 
an 
ethically 
disciplined 
metaphysical 
spirit, 
operating 
according 
to 
the 
canons 
of 
a 
well-applied 
Logic, 
under 
the 
increasing 
light 
of 
Biblical 
science, 
towards 
the 
production 
of 
a 
richly 
intellectual 
and 
yet 



profoundly 
scriptural 
theology, 
and 
the 
attainment, 
for 
the 
Christian 
religion 
and 
the 
Christian 
Church, 
of 
a 
position 
among 
the 
forces 
at 
work 
in 
society, 
which 
the 
human 
agency 
charged 
with 
their 
maintenance 
and 
propagation 
is 
notatliberty 
todisregard. 



Gottfried 
Wilhelm 
Leibnitz(1911)by 
William 
Ritchie 
Sorley 



From 
‘1911 
Encyclopædia 
Britannica’, 
Volume 
16 


GOTTFRIED 
WILHELM 
LEIBNITZ 
(1646-1716), 
German 
philosopher, 
mathematician 
and 
man 
of 
affairs, 
was 
born 
on 
the 
1st 
of 
July 
1646 
at 
Leipzig, 
where 
his 
father 
was 
professor 
of 
moral 
philosophy. 
Though 
the 
name 
Leibniz, 
Leibnitz 
or 
Lubeniecz 
was 
originally 
Slavonic, 
his 
ancestors 
were 
German, 
and 
for 
three 
generations 
had 
been 
in 
the 
employment 
of 
the 
Saxon 
government. 
Young 
Leibnitz 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Nicolai 
school 
at 
Leipzig, 
but, 
from 
1652 
when 
his 
father 
died, 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
for 
the 
most 
part 
his 
own 
teacher. 
From 
his 
father 
he 
had 
acquired 
a 
love 
of 
historical 
study. 
The 
German 
books 
at 
his 
command 
were 
soon 
read 
through, 
and 
with 
the 
help 
of 
two 
Latin 
books 
— 
the 
Thesaurus 
Chronologicus 
of 
Calvisius 
and 
an 
illustrated 
edition 
of 
Livy 
— 
he 
learned 
Latin 
at 
the 
age 
of 
eight. 
His 
father’s 
library 
was 
now 
thrown 
open 
to 
him, 
to 
his 
great 
joy, 
with 
the 
permission, 
“Tolle, 
lege.” 
Before 
he 
was 
twelve 
he 
could 
read 
Latin 
easily 
and 
had 
begun 
Greek; 
he 
had 
also 
remarkable 
facility 
in 
writing 
Latin 
verse. 
He 
next 
turned 
to 
the 
study 
of 
logic, 
attempting 
already 
to 
reform 
its 
doctrines, 
and 
zealously 
readingthescholasticsandsomeoftheProtestanttheologians. 


At 
the 
age 
of 
fifteen, 
he 
entered 
the 
university 
of 
Leipzig 
as 
a 
law 
student. 
His 
first 
two 
years 
were 
devoted 
to 
philosophy 
under 
Jakob 
Thomasius, 
a 
Neo-Aristotelian, 
who 
is 
looked 
upon 
as 
having 
founded 
the 
scientific 
study 
of 
the 
history 
of 
philosophy 
in 
Germany. 
It 
was 
at 
this 
time 
probably 
that 
he 
first 
made 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
modern 
thinkers 
who 
had 
already 
revolutionized 
science 
and 
philosophy, 
Francis 
Bacon, 
Cardan 
and 



Campanella, 
Kepler, 
Galileo 
and 
Descartes; 
and 
he 
began 
to 
consider 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
old 
and 
new 
ways 
of 
regarding 
nature. 
He 
resolved 
to 
study 
mathematics. 
It 
was 
not, 
however, 
till 
the 
summer 
of 
1663, 
which 
he 
spent 
at 
Jena 
under 
E. 
Weigel, 
that 
he 
obtained 
the 
instructions 
of 
a 
mathematician 
of 
repute; 
nor 
was 
the 
deeper 
study 
of 
mathematics 
entered 
upontillhisvisit 
toParisandacquaintancewith 
Huygensmanyyearslater. 


The 
next 
three 
years 
he 
devoted 
to 
legal 
studies, 
and 
in 
1666 
applied 
for 
the 
degree 
of 
doctor 
of 
law, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
obtaining 
the 
post 
of 
assessor. 
Being 
refused 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
his 
youth 
he 
left 
his 
native 
town 
for 
ever. 
The 
doctor’s 
degree 
refused 
him 
there 
was 
at 
once 
(November 
5, 
1666) 
conferred 
on 
him 
at 
Altdorf 
— 
the 
university 
town 
of 
the 
free 
city 
of 
Nuremberg 
— 
where 
his 
brilliant 
dissertation 
procured 
him 
the 
immediate 
offer 
of 
a 
professor’s 
chair. 
This, 
however, 
he 
declined, 
having, 
as 
he 
said, 
“very 
differentthingsinview.” 


Leibnitz, 
not 
yet 
twenty-one 
years 
of 
age, 
was 
already 
the 
author 
of 
several 
remarkable 
essays. 
In 
his 
bachelor’s 
dissertation 
De 
principio 
individui 
(1663), 
he 
defended 
the 
nominalistic 
doctrine 
that 
individuality 
is 
constituted 
by 
the 
whole 
entity 
or 
essence 
of 
a 
thing; 
his 
arithmetical 
tract 
De 
complexionibus, 
published 
in 
an 
extended 
form 
under 
the 
title 
De 
arte 
combinatoria 
(1666), 
is 
an 
essay 
towards 
his 
life-long 
project 
of 
a 
re-formed 
symbolism 
and 
method 
of 
thought; 
and 
besides 
these 
there 
are 
our 
juridical 
essays,includingthe 
Nova 
methodus 
docendi 
discendique 
juris, 
written 
in 
the 
intervals 
of 
his 
journey 
from 
Leipzig 
to 
Altdorf. 
This 
last 
essay 
is 
remarkable, 
not 
only 
for 
the 
reconstruction 
it 
attempted 
of 
the 
Corpus 
Juris, 
but 
as 
containing 
the 
first 
clear 
recognition 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
historical 
method 
in 
law. 
Nuremberg 
was 
a 
centre 
of 
the 
Rosicrucians, 
and 
Leibnitz, 
busying 
himself 
with 
writings 
of 
the 
alchemists, 
soon 
gained 
such 
a 
knowledge 
of 
their 
tenets 
that 
he 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
secret 



brotherhood, 
and 
was 
even 
elected 
their 
secretary. 
A 
more 
important 
result 
of 
his 
visit 
to 
Nuremberg 
was 
his 
acquaintance 
with 
Johann 
Christian 
von 
Boyneburg 
(1622–1672), 
formerly 
first 
minister 
to 
the 
elector 
of 
Mainz, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
most 
distinguished 
German 
statesmen 
of 
the 
day. 
By 
his 
advice 
Leibnitz 
printed 
his 
Nova 
methodus 
in 
1667, 
dedicated 
it 
to 
the 
elector, 
and, 
going 
to 
Mainz, 
presented 
it 
to 
him 
in 
person. 
It 
was 
thus 
that 
Leibnitz 
entered 
the 
service 
of 
the 
elector 
of 
Mainz, 
at 
first 
as 
an 
assistant 
in 
the 
revisionofthestatute-book,afterwards 
onmoreimportantwork. 


The 
policy 
of 
the 
elector, 
which 
the 
pen 
of 
Leibnitz 
was 
now 
called 
upon 
to 
promote, 
was 
to 
maintain 
the 
security 
of 
the 
German 
empire, 
threatened 
on 
the 
west 
by 
the 
aggressive 
power 
of 
France, 
on 
the 
east 
by 
Turkey 
and 
Russia. 
Thus 
when 
in 
1669 
the 
crown 
of 
Poland 
became 
vacant, 
it 
fell 
to 
Leibnitz 
to 
support 
the 
claims 
of 
the 
German 
candidate, 
which 
he 
did 
in 
his 
first 
political 
writing, 
Specimen 
demonstrationum 
politicarum 
pro 
rege 
Polonorum 
eligendo, 
attempting, 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
a 
Catholic 
Polish 
nobleman, 
to 
show 
by 
mathematical 
demonstration 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
Poland 
that 
it 
should 
have 
the 
count 
palatine 
of 
Neuburg 
as 
its 
king. 
But 
neither 
the 
diplomatic 
skill 
of 
Boyneburg, 
who 
had 
been 
sent 
as 
plenipotentiary 
to 
the 
election 
at 
Warsaw, 
nor 
the 
arguments 
of 
Leibnitz 
were 
successful,anda 
Polishprince 
waselectedto 
fillthevacant 
throne. 


A 
greater 
danger 
threatened 
Germany 
in 
the 
aggressions 
of 
Louis 
XIV. 
(see 
France: 
History). 
Though 
Holland 
was 
in 
most 
immediate 
danger, 
the 
seizure 
of 
Lorraine 
in 
1670 
showed 
that 
Germany 
too 
was 
threatened. 
It 
was 
in 
this 
year 
that 
Leibnitz 
wrote 
his 
Thoughts 
on 
Public 
Safety, 
in 
which 
he 
urged 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
new 
“Rheinbund” 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
Germany, 
and 
contended 
that 
the 
states 
of 
Europe 
should 
employ 
their 
power, 
not 
against 
one 
another, 
but 
in 
the 
conquest 
of 
the 
non-Christian 
world, 
in 
which 
Egypt, 
“one 
of 
the 
best 
situated 
lands 
in 
the 
world,” 
would 
fall 
to 
France. 
The 



plan 
thus 
proposed 
of 
averting 
the 
threatened 
attack 
on 
Germany 
by 
a 
French 
expedition 
to 
Egypt 
was 
discussed 
with 
Boyneburg, 
and 
obtained 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
elector. 
French 
relations 
with 
Turkey 
were 
at 
the 
time 
so 
strained 
as 
to 
make 
a 
breach 
imminent, 
and 
at 
the 
close 
of 
1671, 
about 
the 
time 
when 
the 
war 
with 
Holland 
broke 
out, 
Louis 
himself 
was 
approached 
by 
a 
letter 
from 
Boyneburg 
and 
a 
short 
memorial 
from 
the 
pen 
of 
Leibnitz, 
who 
attempted 
to 
show 
that 
Holland 
itself, 
as 
a 
mercantile 
power 
trading 
with 
the 
East, 
mightbe 
best 
attacked 
through 
Egypt, 
whilenothing 
would 
be 
easier 
for 
France 
or 
would 
more 
largely 
increase 
her 
power 
than 
the 
conquest 
of 
Egypt. 
On 
February 
12, 
1672, 
a 
request 
came 
from 
the 
French 
secretary 
of 
state, 
Simon 
Arnauld 
de 
Pomponne 
(1618–1699), 
that 
Leibnitz 
should 
go 
to 
Paris. 
Louis 
seems 
still 
to 
have 
kept 
the 
matter 
in 
view, 
but 
never 
granted 
Leibnitz 
the 
personal 
interview 
he 
desired, 
while 
Pomponne 
wrote, 
“I 
have 
nothing 
against 
the 
plan 
of 
a 
holy 
war, 
but 
such 
plans, 
you 
know, 
since 
the 
days 
of 
St 
Louis, 
have 
ceased 
to 
be 
the 
fashion.” 
Not 
yet 
discouraged, 
Leibnitz 
wrote 
a 
full 
account 
of 
his 
project 
for 
the 
king, 
and 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
same 
evidently 
intended 
for 
Boyneburg. 
But 
Boyneburg 
died 
in 
December 
1672, 
before 
the 
latter 
could 
be 
sent 
to 
him. 
Nor 
did 
the 
former 
ever 
reach 
its 
destination. 
The 
French 
quarrel 
with 
the 
Porte 
was 
made 
up, 
and 
the 
plan 
of 
a 
French 
expedition 
to 
Egypt 
disappeared 
from 
practical 
politics 
till 
the 
time 
of 
Napoleon. 
The 
history 
of 
this 
scheme, 
and 
the 
reason 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
journey 
to 
Paris, 
long 
remained 
hidden 
in 
the 
archives 
of 
the 
Hanoverian 
library. 
It 
was 
on 
his 
taking 
possession 
of 
Hanover 
in 
1803 
that 
Napoleon 
learned, 
through 
the 
Consilium 
Aegyptiacum, 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
French 
conquest 
of 
Egypt 
had 
been 
first 
put 
forward 
by 
a 
German 
philosopher. 
In 
the 
same 
year 
there 
was 
published 
in 
London 
an 
account 
of 
the 
Justa 
dissertatio 
of 
which 
the 
British 
Government 
had 
procured 
a 
copy 
in 
1799. 
But 
it 
was 
only 
with 
the 



appearance 
of 
the 
edition 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
works 
begun 
by 
Onno 
Klopp 
in 
1864 
that 
thefullhistoryofthe 
scheme 
wasmadeknown. 


Leibnitz 
had 
other 
than 
political 
ends 
in 
view 
in 
his 
visit 
to 
France. 
It 
was 
asthecentre 
ofliteratureandscience 
thatParischieflyattracted 
him. 
Political 
duties 
never 
made 
him 
lose 
sight 
of 
his 
philosophical 
and 
scientific 
interests. 
At 
Mainz 
he 
was 
still 
busied 
with 
the 
question 
of 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
old 
and 
new 
methods 
in 
philosophy. 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
Jakob 
Thomasius 
(1669) 
he 
contends 
that 
the 
mechanical 
explanation 
of 
nature 
by 
magnitude, 
figure 
and 
motion 
alone 
is 
not 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
doctrines 
of 
Aristotle’s 
Physics, 
in 
which 
he 
finds 
more 
truth 
than 
in 
the 
Meditations 
of 
Descartes. 
Yet 
these 
qualities 
of 
bodies, 
he 
argues 
in 
1668 
(in 
an 
essay 
published 
without 
his 
knowledge 
under 
the 
title 
Confessio 
naturae 
contra 
atheistas), 
require 
an 
incorporeal 
principle, 
or 
God, 
for 
their 
ultimate 
explanation. 
He 
also 
wrote 
at 
this 
time 
a 
defence 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
Trinity 
against 
Wissowatius 
(1669), 
and 
an 
essay 
on 
philosophic 
style, 
introductory 
to 
an 
edition 
of 
the 
Antibarbarus 
of 
Nizolius 
(1670). 
Clearness 
and 
distinctness 
alone, 
he 
says, 
are 
what 
makes 
a 
philosophic 
style, 
and 
no 
language 
is 
better 
suited 
for 
this 
popular 
exposition 
than 
the 
German. 
In 
1671 
he 
issued 
a 
Hypothesis 
physica 
nova, 
in 
which, 
agreeing 
with 
Descartes 
that 
corporeal 
phenomena 
should 
be 
explained 
from 
motion, 
he 
carried 
out 
the 
mechanical 
explanation 
of 
nature 
by 
contending 
that 
the 
original 
of 
this 
motion 
is 
a 
fine 
aether, 
similar 
to 
light, 
or 
rather 
constituting 
it, 
which, 
penetrating 
all 
bodies 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
earth’s 
axis, 
produces 
the 
phenomena 
of 
gravity, 
elasticity, 
&c. 
The 
first 
part 
of 
the 
essay, 
on 
concrete 
motion, 
was 
dedicated 
to 
the 
Royal 
Society 
of 
London,thesecond, 
onabstractmotion,to 
the 
French 
Academy. 


At 
Paris 
Leibnitz 
met 
with 
Arnauld, 
Malebranche 
and, 
more 
important 
still, 
with 
Christian 
Huygens. 
This 
was 
pre-eminently 
the 
period 
of 
his 
mathematical 
and 
physical 
activity. 
Before 
leaving 
Mainz 
he 
was 
able 
to 



announce 
an 
imposing 
list 
of 
discoveries, 
and 
plans 
for 
discoveries, 
arrived 
at 
by 
means 
of 
his 
new 
logical 
art, 
in 
natural 
philosophy, 
mathematics, 
mechanics, 
optics, 
hydrostatics, 
pneumatics 
and 
nautical 
science, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
new 
ideas 
in 
law, 
theology 
and 
politics. 
Chief 
among 
these 
discoveries 
was 
that 
of 
a 
calculating 
machine 
for 
performing 
more 
complicated 
operations 
than 
that 
of 
Pascal 
— 
multiplying, 
dividing 
and 
extracting 
roots, 
as 
well 
as 
adding 
and 
subtracting. 
This 
machine 
was 
exhibited 
to 
the 
Academy 
of 
Paris 
and 
to 
the 
Royal 
Society 
of 
London, 
and 
Leibnitz 
was 
elected 
a 
fellow 
of 
the 
latter 
society 
in 
April 
1673. 
In 
January 
of 
this 
year 
he 
had 
gone 
to 
London 
as 
an 
attaché 
on 
a 
political 
mission 
from 
the 
elector 
of 
Mainz, 
returning 
in 
March 
to 
Paris, 
and 
while 
in 
London 
had 
become 
personally 
acquainted 
with 
Oldenburg, 
the 
secretary 
of 
the 
Royal 
Society, 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
already 
corresponded, 
with 
Boyle 
the 
chemist 
and 
Pell 
the 
mathematician. 
It 
is 
from 
this 
period 
that 
we 
must 
date 
the 
impulse 
that 
directed 
him 
anew 
to 
mathematics. 
By 
Pell 
he 
had 
been 
referred 
to 
Mercator’s 
Logarithmotechnica 
as 
already 
containing 
some 
numerical 
observations 
which 
Leibnitz 
had 
thought 
original 
on 
his 
own 
part; 
and, 
on 
his 
return 
to 
Paris, 
he 
devoted 
himself 
to 
the 
study 
of 
higher 
geometry 
under 
Huygens, 
entering 
almost 
at 
once 
upon 
the 
series 
of 
investigations 
which 
culminated 
in 
his 
discovery 
of 
the 
differential 
and 
integral 
calculus 
(see 
Infinitesimal 
Calculus). 


Shortly 
after 
his 
return 
to 
Paris 
in 
1673, 
Leibnitz 
ceased 
to 
be 
in 
the 
Mainz 
service 
any 
more 
than 
in 
name, 
but 
in 
the 
same 
year 
entered 
the 
employment 
of 
Duke 
John 
Frederick 
of 
Brunswick-Lüneburg, 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
corresponded 
for 
some 
time. 
In 
1676 
he 
removed 
at 
the 
duke’s 
request 
to 
Hanover, 
travelling 
thither 
by 
way 
of 
London 
and 
Amsterdam. 
At 
Amsterdam 
he 
saw 
and 
conversed 
with 
Spinoza, 
and 
carried 
away 
with 
him 
extracts 
fromthelatter’sunpublished 
Ethica. 



For 
the 
next 
forty 
years, 
and 
under 
three 
successive 
princes, 
Leibnitz 
was 
in 
theservice 
of 
the 
Brunswickfamily,and 
his 
headquarterswere 
at 
Hanover, 
where 
he 
had 
charge 
of 
the 
ducal 
library. 
Leibnitz 
thus 
passed 
into 
a 
political 
atmosphere 
formed 
by 
the 
dynastic 
aims 
of 
the 
typical 
German 
state 
(see 
Hanover; 
Brunswick). 
He 
supported 
the 
claim 
of 
Hanover 
to 
appoint 
an 
ambassador 
at 
the 
congress 
of 
Nimeguen 
(1676) 
to 
defend 
the 
establishment 
of 
primogeniture 
in 
the 
Lüneburg 
branch 
of 
the 
Brunswick 
family; 
and, 
when 
the 
proposal 
was 
made 
to 
raise 
the 
duke 
of 
Hanover 
to 
the 
electorate, 
he 
had 
to 
show 
that 
this 
did 
not 
interfere 
with 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
duke 
of 
Württemberg. 
In 
1692 
the 
duke 
of 
Hanover 
was 
made 
elector. 
Before, 
and 
with 
a 
view 
to 
this, 
Leibnitz 
had 
been 
employed 
by 
him 
to 
write 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Brunswick-Lüneburg 
family, 
and, 
to 
collect 
material 
for 
his 
history, 
had 
undertaken 
a 
journey 
through 
Germany 
and 
Italy 
in 
1687–1690, 
visiting 
and 
examining 
the 
records 
in 
Marburg, 
Frankfort-on-the-Main, 
Munich, 
Vienna 
(where 
he 
remained 
nine 
months), 
Venice, 
Modena 
and 
Rome. 
At 
Rome 
he 
was 
offered 
the 
custodianship 
of 
the 
Vatican 
library 
on 
condition 
of 
his 
joiningtheCatholic 
Church. 


About 
this 
time, 
too, 
his 
thoughts 
and 
energies 
were 
partly 
taken 
up 
with 
thescheme 
forthe 
reunion 
of 
the 
Catholic 
and 
Protestant 
Churches. 
At 
Mainz 
he 
had 
joined 
in 
an 
attempt 
made 
by 
the 
elector 
and 
Boyneburg 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
reconciliation, 
and 
now, 
chiefly 
through 
the 
energy 
and 
skill 
of 
the 
Catholic 
Royas 
de 
Spinola, 
and 
from 
the 
spirit 
of 
moderation 
which 
prevailed 
among 
the 
theologians 
he 
met 
withatHanover 
in 
1683, 
it 
almost 
seemed 
as 
if 
some 
agreement 
might 
be 
arrived 
at. 
In 
1686 
Leibnitz 
wrote 
his 
Systema 
theologicum, 
in 
which 
he 
strove 
to 
find 
common 
ground 
for 
Protestants 
and 
Catholics 
in 
the 
details 
of 
their 
creeds. 
But 
the 
English 
revolution 
of 
1688 
interfered 
with 
the 
scheme 
in 
Hanover, 
and 
it 
was 
soon 
found 
that 
the 
religious 
difficulties 
were 
greater 
than 
had 
at 
one 
time 
appeared. 
In 
the 
letters 



to 
Leibnitz 
from 
Bossuet, 
the 
landgrave 
of 
Hessen-Rheinfels, 
andMadame 
de 
Brinon, 
the 
aim 
is 
obviously 
to 
make 
converts 
to 
Catholicism, 
not 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
compromise 
with 
Protestantism, 
and 
when 
it 
was 
found 
that 
Leibnitz 
refused 
to 
be 
converted 
the 
correspondence 
ceased. 
A 
further 
scheme 
of 
church 
union 
in 
which 
Leibnitz 
was 
engaged, 
that 
between 
the 
Reformed 
and 
LutheranChurches, 
metwith 
nobettersuccess. 


Returning 
from 
Italy 
in 
1690, 
Leibnitz 
was 
appointed 
librarian 
at 
Wolfenbüttel 
by 
Duke 
Anton 
of 
Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. 
Some 
years 
afterwards 
began 
his 
connexion 
with 
Berlin 
through 
his 
friendship 
with 
the 
electress 
Sophie 
Charlotte 
of 
Brandenburg 
and 
her 
mother 
the 
princess 
Sophie 
of 
Hanover. 
He 
was 
invited 
to 
Berlin 
in 
1700, 
and 
on 
the 
11th 
July 
of 
that 
year 
the 
academy 
(Akademie 
der 
Wissenschaften) 
he 
had 
planned 
was 
founded,withhimselfas 
itspresidentforlife. 
Inthesameyear 
hewasmadea 
privy 
councillor 
of 
justice 
by 
the 
elector 
of 
Brandenburg. 
Four 
years 
before 
he 
had 
received 
a 
like 
honour 
from 
the 
elector 
of 
Hanover, 
and 
twelve 
years 
afterwardsthesamedistinctionwas 
conferred 
uponhimby 
Peter 
theGreat,to 
whom 
he 
gave 
a 
plan 
for 
an 
academy 
at 
St 
Petersburg, 
carried 
out 
after 
the 
czar’s 
death. 
After 
the 
death 
of 
his 
royal 
pupil 
in 
1705 
his 
visits 
to 
Berlin 
became 
less 
frequent 
and 
less 
welcome, 
and 
in 
1711 
he 
was 
there 
for 
the 
last 
time. 
In 
the 
following 
year 
he 
undertook 
his 
fifth 
and 
last 
journey 
to 
Vienna, 
where 
he 
stayed 
till 
1714. 
An 
attempt 
to 
found 
an 
academy 
of 
science 
there 
was 
defeated 
by 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
Jesuits, 
but 
he 
now 
attained 
the 
honour 
he 
had 
coveted 
of 
an 
imperial 
privy 
councillorship 
(1712), 
and, 
either 
at 
this 
time 
or 
on 
a 
previous 
occasion 
(1709), 
was 
made 
a 
baron 
of 
the 
empire 
(Reichsfreiherr). 
Leibnitz 
returned 
to 
Hanover 
in 
September 
1714, 
but 
found 
the 
elector 
George 
Louis 
had 
already 
gone 
to 
assume 
the 
crown 
of 
England. 
Leibnitz 
would 
gladly 
have 
followed 
him 
to 
London, 
but 
was 
bidden 
to 
remainat 
Hanoverandfinish 
his 
historyofBrunswick. 



During 
the 
last 
thirty 
years 
Leibnitz 
had 
been 
busy 
with 
many 
matters. 
Mathematics, 
natural 
science, 
philosophy, 
theology, 
history 
jurisprudence, 
politics 
(particularly 
the 
French 
wars 
with 
Germany, 
and 
the 
question 
of 
the 
Spanish 
succession), 
economics 
and 
philology, 
all 
gained 
a 
share 
of 
his 
attention;almostallofthemheenrichedwithoriginal 
observations. 


His 
genealogical 
researches 
in 
Italy 
— 
through 
which 
he 
established 
the 
common 
origin 
of 
the 
families 
of 
Brunswick 
and 
Este 
— 
were 
not 
only 
preceded 
by 
an 
immense 
collection 
of 
historical 
sources, 
but 
enabled 
him 
to 
publish 
materials 
for 
a 
code 
of 
international 
law. 
The 
history 
of 
Brunswick 
itself 
was 
the 
last 
work 
of 
his 
life, 
and 
had 
covered 
the 
period 
from 
768 
to 
1005 
when 
death 
ended 
his 
labours. 
But 
the 
government, 
in 
whose 
service 
and 
at 
whose 
order 
the 
work 
had 
been 
carried 
out, 
left 
it 
in 
the 
archives 
of 
the 
Hanover 
librarytillitwaspublishedbyPertzin 
1843. 


It 
was 
in 
the 
years 
between 
1690 
and 
1716 
that 
Leibnitz’s 
chief 
philosophical 
works 
were 
composed, 
and 
during 
the 
first 
ten 
of 
these 
years 
the 
accounts 
of 
his 
system 
were, 
for 
the 
most 
part, 
preliminary 
sketches. 
Indeed, 
he 
never 
gave 
a 
full 
and 
systematic 
account 
of 
his 
doctrines. 
His 
views 
have 
to 
be 
gathered 
from 
letters 
to 
friends, 
from 
occasional 
articles 
in 
the 
Acta 
Eruditorum, 
the 
Journal 
des 
Savants, 
and 
other 
journals, 
and 
from 
one 
or 
two 
more 
extensive 
works. 
It 
is 
evident, 
however, 
that 
philosophy 
had 
not 
been 
entirely 
neglected 
in 
the 
years 
in 
which 
his 
pen 
was 
almost 
solely 
occupied 
with 
other 
matters. 
A 
letter 
to 
the 
duke 
of 
Brunswick, 
and 
another 
to 
Arnauld, 
in 
1671, 
show 
that 
he 
had 
already 
reached 
his 
new 
notion 
of 
substance; 
but 
it 
is 
in 
the 
correspondence 
with 
Antoine 
Arnauld, 
between 
1686 
and 
1690, 
that 
his 
fundamental 
ideas 
and 
the 
reasons 
for 
them 
are 
for 
the 
first 
time 
made 
clear. 
The 
appearance 
of 
Locke’s 
Essay 
in 
1690 
induced 
him 
(1696) 
to 
note 
down 
his 
objections 
to 
it, 
and 
his 
own 
ideas 
on 
the 
same 
subjects. 
In 
1703–1704 
these 
were 
worked 
out 
in 
detail 
and 
ready 
for 



publication, 
when 
the 
death 
of 
the 
author 
whom 
they 
criticized 
prevented 
their 
appearance 
(first 
published 
by 
Raspe, 
1765). 
In 
1710 
appeared 
the 
only 
complete 
and 
systematic 
philosophical 
work 
of 
his 
life-time, 
Essais 
de 
Théodicée 
sur 
la 
bonté 
de 
Dieu, 
la 
liberté 
de 
l’homme, 
et 
l’origine 
du 
mal, 
originally 
undertaken 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
late 
queen 
of 
Prussia, 
who 
had 
wished 
a 
reply 
to 
Bayle’s 
opposition 
of 
faith 
and 
reason. 
In 
1714 
he 
wrote, 
for 
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Savoy, 
a 
sketch 
of 
his 
system 
under 
the 
title 
of 
La 
Monadologie, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
year 
appeared 
his 
Principes 
de 
la 
nature 
et 
de 
la 
grâce. 
The 
last 
few 
years 
of 
his 
life 
were 
perhaps 
more 
occupied 
with 
correspondence 
than 
any 
others, 
and, 
in 
a 
philosophical 
regard, 
were 
chiefly 
notable 
for 
the 
letters, 
which, 
through 
the 
desire 
of 
the 
new 
queen 
of 
England,heinterchanged 
withClarke, 
sur 
Dieu, 
l’âme, 
l’espace, 
la 
durée. 


Leibnitz 
died 
on 
the 
14th 
of 
November 
1716, 
his 
closing 
years 
enfeebled 
by 
disease, 
harassed 
by 
controversy, 
embittered 
by 
neglect; 
but 
to 
the 
last 
he 
preserved 
the 
indomitable 
energy 
and 
power 
of 
work 
to 
which 
is 
largely 
due 
the 
position 
he 
holds 
as, 
more 
perhaps 
than 
any 
one 
in 
modern 
times, 
a 
man 
of 
almost 
universal 
attainments 
and 
almost 
universal 
genius. 
Neither 
at 
Berlin, 
in 
the 
academy 
which 
he 
had 
founded, 
nor 
in 
London, 
whither 
his 
sovereign 
had 
gone 
to 
rule, 
was 
any 
notice 
taken 
of 
his 
death. 
At 
Hanover, 
Eckhart, 
his 
secretary, 
was 
his 
only 
mourner; 
“he 
was 
buried,” 
says 
an 
eyewitness, 
“more 
like 
a 
robber 
than 
what 
he 
really 
was, 
the 
ornament 
of 
his 
country.” 
Only 
in 
the 
French 
Academy 
was 
the 
loss 
recognized, 
and 
a 
worthy 
eulogium 
devoted 
to 
his 
memory 
(November 
13, 
1717). 
The 
200th 
anniversary 
of 
his 
birth 
was 
celebrated 
in 
1846, 
and 
in 
the 
same 
year 
were 
opened 
the 
Königlichsächsische 
Gesellschaft 
der 
Wissenschaften 
and 
the 
Kaiserliche 
Akademie 
der 
Wissenschaften 
in 
Leipzig 
and 
Vienna 
respectively. 
In1883,a

Leibnitz 
possessed 
a 
wonderful 
power 
of 
rapidand 
continuous 
work. 
Even 
in 
travelling 
his 
time 
was 
employed 
in 
solving 
mathematical 
problems. 
He 
is 
described 
as 
moderate 
in 
his 
habits, 
quick 
of 
temper 
but 
easily 
appeased, 
charitable 
in 
his 
judgments 
of 
others, 
and 
tolerant 
of 
differences 
of 
opinion, 
though 
impatient 
of 
contradiction 
on 
small 
matters. 
He 
is 
also 
said 
to

Philosophy. 
— 
The 
central 
point 
in 
the 
philosophy 
of 
Leibnitz 
was 
only 
arrived 
at 
after 
many 
advances 
and 
corrections 
in 
his 
opinions. 
This 
point 
is 
his 
new 
doctrine 
of 
substance 
(), 
and 
it 
is 
through 
it 
that 
unity 
is 
given 
to 
the 
succession 
of 
occasional 
writings, 
scattered 
over 
fifty 
years, 
in 
which 
he 
explained 
his 
views. 
More 
inclined 
to 
agree 
than 
to 
differ 
with 
what 
he 
read 
(), 
and 
borrowing 
from 
almost 
every 
philosophical 
system, 
his 
own 
standpoint 
is 
yet 
most 
closely 
related 
to 
that 
of 
Descartes, 
partly 
as 
consequence, 
partly 
by 
way 
of 
opposition. 
Cartesianism, 
Leibnitz 
often 
asserted, 
is 
the 
ante-room 
of 
truth, 
but 
the 
ante-room 
only. 
Descartes’s 
separation 
of 
things 
into 
two 
heterogeneous 
substances 
only 
connected 
by 
the 
omnipotence 
of 
God, 
and 
the 
more 
logical 
absorption 
of 
both 
by 
Spinoza 
into 
the 
one 
divine 
substance, 
followed 
from 
an 
erroneous 
conception 
of 
what 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
substance 
is. 
Substance, 
the 
ultimate 
reality, 
can 
only 
be 
conceived 
as 
force. 
Hence 
Leibnitz’s 
metaphysical 
view 
of 
the 
monads 
as 
simple, 
percipient, 
self-active 
beings, 
the 
constituent 
elements 
of 
all 
things, 
his 
physical 
doctrines 
of 
the 
reality 
and 
constancy 
of 
force 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
space, 
matter 
and 
motion 
are 
merely 
phenomenal, 
and 
his 
psychological 
conception 
of 
the 
continuity 
anddevelopment 
of 
consciousness. 
In 
theclosest 
connexion 
with 
the 
same 
stand 
his 
logical 
principles 
of 
consistency 
and 
sufficient 
reason, 
and 
the 
method 
he 
developed 
from 
them, 
his 
ethical 
end 
of 
perfection, 
and 
his 
crowning 
theological 
conception 
of 
the 
universe 
as 
the 



best 
possible 
world, 
and 
of 
God 
both 
as 
its 
efficient 
cause 
and 
its 
final 
harmony. 


The 
ultimate 
elements 
of 
the 
universe 
are, 
according 
to 
Leibnitz, 
individual 
centres 
of 
force 
or 
monads. 
Why 
they 
should 
be 
individual, 
and 
not 
manifestations 
of 
one 
world-force, 
he 
never 
clearly 
proves. 
His 
doctrine 
of 
individuality 
seems 
to 
have 
been 
arrived 
at, 
not 
by 
strict 
deduction 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
force, 
but 
rather 
from 
the 
empirical 
observation 
that 
it 
is 
by 
the 
manifestation 
of 
its 
activity 
that 
the 
separate 
existence 
of 
the 
individual 
becomes 
evident; 
for 
his 
system 
individuality 
is 
as 
fundamental 
as 
activity. 
“The 
monads,” 
he 
says, 
“are 
the 
very 
atoms 
of 
nature 
— 
in 
a 
word, 
the 
elements 
of 
things,” 
but, 
as 
centres 
of 
force, 
they 
have 
neither 
parts, 
extension 
nor 
figure 
(). 
Hence 
their 
distinction 
from 
the 
atoms 
of 
Democritus 
and 
the 
materialists. 
They 
are 
metaphysical 
points 
or 
rather 
spiritual 
beings 
whose 
very 
nature 
it 
is 
to 
act. 
As 
the 
bent 
bow 
springs 
back 
of 
itself, 
so 
the 
monads 
naturally 
pass 
and 
are 
always 
passing 
into 
action 
without 
any 
aid 
but 
the 
absence 
of 
opposition 
(). 
Nor 
do 
they, 
like 
the 
atoms, 
act 
upon 
one 
another 
(); 
the 
action 
of 
each 
excludes 
that 
of 
every 
other. 
The 
activity 
of 
each 
is 
the 
result 
of 
its 
own 
past 
state, 
the 
determinator 
of 
its 
own 
future 
(p, 
722). 
“The 
monads 
havenowindows 
bywhichanythingmaygo 
inorout” 
(). 


Further,sinceallsubstancesareofthenature 
offorce,it 
follows 
that— 
“in 
imitation 
of 
the 
notion 
which 
we 
have 
of 
souls” 
— 
they 
must 
contain 
something 
analogous 
to 
feeling 
and 
appetite. 
It 
is 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
monad 
to 
represent 
the 
many 
in 
one, 
and 
this 
is 
perception, 
by 
which 
external 
events 
are 
mirrored 
internally 
(). 
Through 
their 
own 
activity 
the 
monads 
mirror 
the 
universe 
(), 
but 
each 
in 
its 
own 
way 
and 
from 
its 
own 
point 
of 
view, 
that 
is, 
with 
a 
more 
or 
less 
perfect 
perception 
(); 
for 
the 
Cartesians 
were 
wrong 
in 
ignoring 
the 
infinite 
grades 
of 
perception, 
and 
identifying 
it 
with 
the 
reflex 
cognizance 
of 
it 
which 
may 
be 
called 
apperception. 
Every 
monad 
is 
thus 
a 



microcosm, 
the 
universe 
in 
little, 
and 
according 
to 
the 
degree 
of 
its 
activity 
is 
the 
distinctness 
of 
its 
representation 
of 
the 
universe 
(). 
Thus 
Leibnitz, 
borrowing 
the 
Aristotelian 
term, 
calls 
the 
monads 
entelechies, 
because 
they 
have 
a 
certain 
perfection 
(τὸ 
ἐντελές) 
and 
sufficiency 
(αὐτάρκεια) 
which 
make 
them 
sources 
of 
their 
internal 
actions 
and, 
so 
to 
speak, 
incorporeal 
automata 
(). 
That 
the 
monads 
are 
not 
pure 
entelechies 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
differences 
amongst 
them. 
Excluding 
all 
external 
limitation, 
they 
are 
yet 
limited 
by 
their 
own 
nature. 
All 
created 
monads 
contain 
a 
passive 
element 
or 
materia 
prima 
(p, 
687, 
725), 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
their 
perceptions 
are 
more 
or 
less 
confused. 
As 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
monad 
consists 
in 
perception, 
this 
is 
inhibited 
by 
the 
passive 
principle, 
so 
that 
there 
arises 
in 
the 
monad 
an 
appetite 
or 
tendency 
to 
overcome 
the 
inhibition 
and 
become 
more 
perceptive, 
whence 
follows 
the 
change 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another 
(p, 
714). 
By 
the 
proportion 
of 
activity 
to 
passivity 
in 
it 
one 
monad 
is 
differentiated 
from 
another. 
The 
greater 
the 
amountof 
activityorof 
distinct 
perceptionsthe 
more 
perfect 
is 
the 
monad; 
the 
stronger 
the 
element 
of 
passivity, 
the 
more 
confused 
its 
perceptions, 
the 
less 
perfect 
is 
it 
(). 
The 
soul 
would 
be 
a 
divinity 
had 
it 
nothingbutdistinctperceptions(). 


The 
monad 
is 
never 
without 
a 
perception; 
but, 
when 
it 
has 
a 
number 
of 
little 
perceptions 
with 
no 
means 
of 
distinction, 
a 
state 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
being 
stunned 
ensues, 
the 
monade 
nue 
being 
perpetually 
in 
this 
state 
(). 
Between 
this 
and 
the 
most 
distinct 
perception 
there 
is 
room 
for 
an 
infinite 
diversity 
of 
nature 
among 
the 
monads 
themselves. 
Thus 
no 
one 
monad 
is 
exactly 
the 
same 
as 
another; 
for, 
were 
it 
possible 
that 
there 
should 
be 
two 
identical, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
sufficient 
reason 
why 
God, 
who 
brings 
them 
into 
actual 
existence,shouldputone 
ofthematonedefinitetimeandplace,theother 
ata 
different 
time 
and 
place. 
This 
is 
Leibnitz’s 
principle 
of 
the 
identity 
of 
indiscernibles 
(p, 
755); 
by 
it 
his 
early 
problem 
as 
to 
the 
principle 
of 



individuation 
is 
solved 
by 
the 
distinction 
between 
genus 
and 
individual 
being 
abolished, 
and 
every 
individual 
made 
sui 
generis. 
The 
principle 
thus 
established 
is 
formulated 
in 
Leibnitz’s 
law 
of 
continuity, 
founded, 
he 
says, 
on 
the 
doctrine 
of 
the 
mathematical 
infinite, 
essential 
to 
geometry, 
and 
of 
importance 
in 
physics 
(p, 
105), 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
there 
is 
neither 
vacuum 
nor 
break 
in 
nature, 
but 
“everything 
takes 
place 
by 
degrees” 
(), 
the 
different 
species 
of 
creatures 
rising 
by 
insensible 
steps 
from 
the 
lowest 
to 
the 
mostperfectform(). 


As 
in 
every 
monad 
each 
succeeding 
state 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
the 
preceding, 
and 
as 
it 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
every 
monad 
to 
mirror 
or 
represent 
the 
universe, 
it 
follows 
() 
that 
the 
perceptive 
content 
of 
each 
monad 
is 
in 
“accord” 
or 
correspondence 
withthatofevery 
other 
(cf. 
),thoughthis 
content 
is 
represented 
with 
infinitely 
varying 
degrees 
of 
perfection. 
This 
is 
Leibnitz’s 
famous 
doctrine 
of 
pre-established 
harmony, 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
the 
infinitely 
numerous 
independent 
substances 
of 
which 
the 
world 
is 
composed 
are 
related 
to 
each 
other 
and 
form 
one 
universe. 
It 
is 
essential 
to 
notice 
that 
it 
proceeds 
from 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
the 
monads 
as 
percipient, 
self-acting 
beings, 
and 
not 
fromanarbitrary 
determinationoftheDeity. 


From 
this 
harmony 
of 
self-determining 
percipient 
units 
Leibnitz 
has 
to 
explain 
the 
world 
of 
nature 
and 
mind. 
As 
everything 
that 
really 
exists 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
spiritual 
or 
metaphysical 
points 
(), 
it 
follows 
that 
space 
and 
matter 
in 
the 
ordinary 
sense 
can 
only 
have 
a 
phenomenal 
existence 
(), 
being 
dependent 
not 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
monads 
themselves 
but 
on 
the 
way 
in 
which 
they 
are 
perceived. 
Considering 
that 
several 
things 
exist 
at 
the 
same 
time 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
order 
of 
coexistence, 
and 
mistaking 
this 
constant 
relation 
for 
something 
that 
exists 
outside 
of 
them, 
the 
mind 
forms 
the 
confused 
perception 
of 
space 
(). 
But 
space 
and 
time 
are 
merely 
relative, 
the 
former 
an 
order 
of 
coexistences, 
the 
latter 
of 
successions 
(p, 
752). 
Hence 
not 



only 
the 
secondary 
qualities 
of 
Descartes 
and 
Locke, 
but 
their 
so-called 
primary 
qualities 
as 
well, 
are 
merely 
phenomenal 
(). 
The 
monads 
are 
really 
without 
position 
or 
distance 
from 
each 
other; 
but, 
as 
we 
perceive 
several 
simplesubstances,thereisforusanaggregateor 
extendedmass. 
Bodyisthus 
active 
extension 
(p, 
111). 
The 
unity 
of 
the 
aggregate 
depends 
entirely 
on 
our 
perceiving 
the 
monads 
composing 
it 
together. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
an 
absolute 
vacuum 
or 
empty 
space, 
any 
more 
than 
there 
are 
indivisible 
material 
units 
or 
atoms 
from 
which 
all 
things 
are 
built 
up 
(p, 
186, 
277). 
Body, 
corporeal 
mass, 
or, 
as 
Leibnitz 
calls 
it, 
to 
distinguish 
it 
from 
the 
materia 
prima 
of 
which 
every 
monad 
partakes 
(), 
materia 
secunda, 
is 
thus 
only 
a 
“phenomenon 
bene 
fundatum” 
(). 
It 
is 
not 
a 
substantia 
but 
substantiae 
or 
substantiatum 
(). 
While 
this, 
however, 
is 
the 
only 
view 
consistent 
with 
Leibnitz’s 
fundamental 
principles, 
and 
is 
often 
clearly 
stated 
by 
himself, 
he 
also 
speaks 
at 
other 
times 
of 
the 
materia 
secunda 
as 
itself 
a 
composite 
substance, 
and 
of 
a 
real 
metaphysical 
bond 
between 
soul 
and 
body. 
But 
these 
expressions 
occur 
chiefly 
in 
the 
letters 
to 
des 
Bosses, 
in 
which 
Leibnitz 
is 
trying 
to 
reconcile 
his 
views 
with 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
Roman 
Catholic 
Church, 
especially 
with 
that 
of 
the 
real 
presence 
in 
the 
Eucharist, 
and 
are 
usually 
referred 
to 
by 
him 
as 
doctrines 
of 
faith 
or 
as 
hypothetical 
(see 
especially 
). 
The 
true 
vinculum 
substantiale 
is 
not 
the 
materia 
secunda, 
which 
a 
consistent 
development 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
principles 
can 
only 
regard 
as 
phenomenal, 
but 
the 
materia 
prima, 
through 
which 
the 
monads 
are 
individualized 
and 
distinguished 
and 
their 
connexion 
rendered 
possible. 
And 
Leibnitz 
seems 
to 
recognize 
that 
the 
opposite 
assumption 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
hiscardinal 
metaphysicalviewof 
themonadsasthe 
onlyrealities. 


From 
Leibnitz’s 
doctrine 
of 
force 
as 
the 
ultimate 
reality 
it 
follows 
that 
his 
view 
of 
nature 
must 
be 
throughout 
dynamical. 
And 
though 
his 
project 
of 
a 
dynamic, 
or 
theory 
of 
natural 
philosophy, 
was 
never 
carried 
out, 
the 
outlines 



ofhisowntheoryandhiscriticismofthe 
mechanicalphysicsofDescartesare 
known 
to 
us. 
The 
whole 
distinction 
between 
the 
two 
lies 
in 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
mechanical 
and 
the 
dynamical 
views 
of 
nature. 
Descartes 
started 
from 
the 
reality 
of 
extension 
as 
constituting 
the 
nature 
of 
material 
substance, 
and 
found 
in 
magnitude, 
figure 
and 
motion 
the 
explanation 
of 
the 
material 
universe. 
Leibnitz, 
too, 
admitted 
the 
mechanical 
view 
of 
nature 
as 
giving 
the 
laws 
of 
corporeal 
phenomena 
(), 
applying 
also 
to 
everything 
that 
takes 
place 
in 
animal 
organisms,even 
thehumanbody 
(). 
But, 
as 
phenomenal,these 
laws 
must 
find 
their 
explanation 
in 
metaphysics, 
and 
thus 
in 
final 
causes 
(). 
All 
things, 
he 
says 
(in 
his 
Specimen 
Dynamicum), 
can 
be 
explained 
either 
by 
efficient 
or 
by 
final 
causes. 
But 
the 
latter 
method 
is 
not 
appropriate 
to 
individual 
occurrences, 
though 
it 
must 
be 
applied 
when 
the 
laws 
of 
mechanism 
themselves 
need 
explanation 
(). 
For 
Descartes’s 
doctrine 
of 
the 
constancy 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
motion 
(i.e. 
momentum) 
in 
the 
world 
Leibnitz 
substitutes 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
vis 
viva, 
and 
contends 
that 
the 
Cartesian 
position 
that 
motion 
is 
measured 
by 
velocity 
should 
be 
superseded 
by 
the 
law 
that 
moving 
force 
(vis 
motrix) 
is 
measured 
by 
the 
square 
of 
the 
velocity 
(p, 
193). 
The 
long 
controversy 
raised 
by 
this 
criticism 
was 
really 
caused 
by 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
the 
terms 
employed. 
The 
principles 
held 
by 
Descartes 
and 
Leibnitz 
were 
both 
correct, 
though 
different, 
and 
their 
conflict 
only 
apparent. 
Descartes’s 
principle 
is 
now 
enunciated 
as 
the 
conservation 
of 
momentum, 
that 
of 
Leibnitz 
as 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy. 
Leibnitz 
further 
criticizes 
the 
Cartesian 
view 
that 
the 
mind 
can 
alter 
the 
direction 
of 
motion 
though 
it 
cannot 
initiate 
it, 
and 
contends 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
“vis 
directiva,” 
estimated 
between 
the 
same 
parts, 
is 
constant 
() 
— 
a 
position 
developed 
in 
his 
statical 
theorem 
for 
determining 
geometrically 
the 
resultant 
of 
any 
numberofforcesactingatapoint. 



Like 
the 
monad, 
body, 
which 
is 
its 
analogue, 
has 
a 
passive 
and 
an 
active 
element. 
The 
former 
is 
the 
capacity 
of 
resistance, 
and 
includes 
impenetrability 
and 
inertia; 
the 
latter 
is 
active 
force 
(p, 
687). 
Bodies, 
too, 
like 
the 
monads, 
are 
self-contained 
activities, 
receiving 
no 
impulse 
from 
without 


— 
it 
is 
only 
by 
an 
accommodation 
to 
ordinary 
language 
that 
we 
speak 
of 
themasdoingso 
—butmovingthemselvesinharmonywith 
eachother(). 
The 
psychology 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
chiefly 
developed 
in 
the 
Nouveaux 
essais 
sur 
l’entendement 
humain, 
written 
in 
answer 
to 
Locke’s 
famous 
Essay, 
and 
criticizing 
it 
chapter 
by 
chapter. 
In 
these 
essays 
he 
worked 
out 
a 
theory 
of 
the 
origin 
and 
development 
of 
knowledge 
in 
harmony 
with 
his 
metaphysical 
views, 
and 
thus 
without 
Locke’s 
implied 
assumption 
of 
the 
mutual 
influence 
of 
soul 
and 
body. 
When 
one 
monad 
in 
an 
aggregate 
perceives 
the 
others 
so 
clearly 
that 
they 
are 
in 
comparison 
with 
it 
bare 
monads 
(monades 
nues), 
it 
is 
said 
to 
be 
the 
ruling 
monad 
of 
the 
aggregate, 
not 
because 
it 
actually 
does 
exert 
an 
influence 
over 
the 
rest, 
but 
because, 
being 
in 
close 
correspondence 
with 
them, 
and 
yet 
having 
so 
much 
clearer 
perception, 
it 
seems 
to 
do 
so 
(). 
This 
monad 
is 
called 
the 
entelechy 
or 
soul 
of 
the 
aggregate 
or 
body, 
and 
as 
such 
mirrors 
the 
aggregate 
in 
the 
first 
place 
and 
the 
universe 
through 
it 
(). 
Each 
soul 
or 
entelechy 
is 
surrounded 
by 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
monads 
forming 
its 
body 
(); 
soul 
and 
body 
together 
make 
a 
living 
being, 
and, 
as 
their 
laws 
are 
in 
perfect 
harmony 
— 
a 
harmony 
established 
between 
the 
whole 
realm 
of 
final 
causes 
and 
that 
of 
efficient 
causes 
() 
— 
we 
have 
the 
same 
result 
as 
if 
one 
influenced 
the 
other. 
This 
is 
further 
explained 
by 
Leibnitz 
in 
his 
well-known 
illustration 
of 
the 
different 
ways 
in 
which 
two 
clocks 
may 
keepexactlythesametime. 
Themachinery 
oftheone 
mayactually 
movethat 
of 
the 
other, 
or 
whenever 
one 
moves 
the 
mechanician 
may 
make 
a 
similar 
alteration 
in 
the 
other, 
or 
they 
may 
have 
been 
so 
perfectly 
constructed 
at 
first 
as 
to 
continue 
to 
correspond 
at 
every 
instant 
without 
any 
further 
influence 
(p, 



134). 
The 
first 
way 
represents 
the 
common 
(Locke’s) 
theory 
of 
mutual 
influence, 
the 
second 
the 
method 
of 
the 
occasionalists, 
the 
third 
that 
of 
preestablished 
harmony. 
Thus 
the 
body 
does 
not 
act 
on 
the 
soul 
in 
the 
production 
of 
cognition, 
nor 
the 
soul 
onthe 
bodyinthe 
production 
of 
motion. 
The 
body 
acts 
just 
as 
if 
it 
had 
no 
soul, 
the 
soul 
as 
if 
it 
had 
no 
body 
(). 
Instead, 
therefore, 
of 
all 
knowledge 
coming 
to 
us 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
through 
the 
bodily 
senses, 
it 
is 
all 
developed 
by 
the 
soul’s 
own 
activity, 
and 
sensuous 
perception 
is 
itself 
but 
a 
confused 
kind 
of 
cognition. 
Not 
a 
certain 
select 
class 
of 
our 
ideas 
only 
(as 
Descartes 
held), 
but 
all 
our 
ideas, 
are 
innate, 
though 
only 
worked 
up 
into 
actual 
cognition 
in 
the 
development 
of 
knowledge 
(). 
To 
the 
aphorism 
made 
use 
of 
by 
Locke, 
“Nihil 
est 
in 
intellectu 
quod 
non 
prius 
fuerit 
in 
sensu,” 
must 
be 
added 
the 
clause, 
“nisi 
intellectus 
ipse” 
(). 
The 
soul 
atbirth 
isnotcomparableto 
a 
tabula 
rasa, 
but 
rather 
to 
an 
unworked 
block 
of 
marble, 
the 
hidden 
veins 
of 
which 
already 
determine 
the 
form 
it 
is 
to 
assume 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
sculptor 
(). 
Nor, 
again, 
can 
the 
soul 
ever 
be 
without 
perception; 
for 
it 
has 
no 
other 
nature 
than 
that 
of 
a 
percipient 
active 
being 
(). 
Apparently 
dreamless 
sleep 
is 
to 
be 
accounted 
for 
by 
unconscious 
perception 
(); 
and 
it 
is 
by 
such 
insensible 
perceptions 
that 
Leibnitz 
explains 
his 
doctrine 
ofpre-establishedharmony(). 


In 
the 
human 
soul 
perception 
is 
developed 
into 
thought, 
and 
there 
is 
thus 
aninfinitethough 
gradual 
differencebetween 
itandthemeremonad(). 
Asall 
knowledge 
is 
implicit 
in 
the 
soul, 
it 
follows 
that 
its 
perfection 
depends 
on 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
instrument 
by 
which 
it 
is 
developed. 
Hence 
the 
importance, 
in 
Leibnitz’s 
system, 
of 
the 
logical 
principles 
and 
method, 
the 
consideration 
ofwhichoccupiedhimatintervals 
throughouthiswholecareer. 


There 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
truths 
— 
(1) 
truths 
of 
reasoning, 
and 
(2) 
truths 
of 
fact 
(p, 
99, 
707). 
The 
former 
rest 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
identity 
(or 
contradiction) 
or 
of 
possibility, 
in 
virtue 
of 
which 
that 
is 
false 
which 
contains 



a 
contradiction, 
and 
that 
true 
which 
is 
contradictory 
to 
the 
false. 
The 
latter 
rest 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
sufficient 
reason 
or 
of 
reality 
(compossibilité), 
according 
to 
which 
no 
fact 
is 
true 
unless 
there 
be 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
why 
it 
should 
be 
so 
and 
not 
otherwise 
(agreeing 
thus 
with 
the 
principium 
melioris 
or 
final 
cause). 
God 
alone, 
the 
purely 
active 
monad, 
has 
an 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
of 
the 
latter 
class 
of 
truths; 
they 
have 
their 
source 
in 
the 
human 
mind 
only 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
mirrors 
the 
outer 
world, 
i.e. 
in 
its 
passivity, 
whereas 
the 
truths 
of 
reasonhave 
theirsourcein 
ourmind 
initselforin 
itsactivity. 


Both 
kinds 
of 
truths 
fall 
into 
two 
classes, 
primitive 
and 
derivative. 
The 
primitive 
truths 
of 
fact 
are, 
as 
Descartes 
held, 
those 
of 
internal 
experience, 
and 
the 
derivative 
truths 
are 
inferred 
from 
them 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
sufficient 
reason, 
by 
their 
agreement 
with 
our 
perception 
of 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole. 
They 
are 
thus 
reached 
by 
probable 
arguments 
— 
a 
department 
of 
logic 
which 
Leibnitz 
was 
the 
first 
to 
bring 
into 
prominence 
(p, 
164, 
168, 
169, 
343). 
The 
primitive 
truths 
of 
reasoning 
are 
identical 
(in 
later 
terminology, 
analytical) 
propositions, 
the 
derivative 
truths 
being 
deduced 
from 
them 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
contradiction. 
The 
part 
of 
his 
logic 
on 
which 
Leibnitz 
laid 
the 
greatest 
stresswasthe 
separation 
of 
these 
rational 
cognitions 
into 
their 
simplest 
elements 
— 
for 
he 
held 
that 
the 
root-notions 
(cogitationes 
primae) 
would 
be 
found 
to 
be 
few 
in 
number 
(p, 
93) 
— 
and 
the 
designation 
of 
them 
by 
universal 
characters 
or 
symbols, 
composite 
notions 
being 
denoted 
by 
the 
formulae 
formed 
by 
the 
union 
of 
several 
definite 
characters, 
and 
judgments 
by 
the 
relation 
of 
aequipollence 
among 
these 
formulae, 
so 
as 
to 
reduce 
the 
syllogism 
to 
a 
calculus. 
This 
is 
the 
main 
idea 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
“universal 
characteristic,” 
never 
fully 
worked 
out 
by 
him, 
which 
he 
regarded 
as 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
discoveries 
of 
the 
age. 
An 
incidental 
result 
of 
its 
adoption 
would 
be 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
universal 
symbolism 
of 
thought 
comparable 
to 
the 
symbolism 
of 
mathematics 
and 
intelligible 
in 
all 
languages 



(cf. 
). 
But 
the 
great 
revolution 
it 
would 
effect 
would 
chiefly 
consist 
in 
this, 
that 
truth 
and 
falsehood 
would 
be 
no 
longer 
matters 
of 
opinion 
but 
of 
correctness 
or 
error 
in 
calculation, 
(p, 
84, 
89, 
93). 
The 
old 
Aristotelian 
analytic 
is 
not 
to 
be 
superseded; 
but 
it 
is 
to 
be 
supplemented 
by 
this 
new 
method,forof 
itself 
itis 
but 
the 
ABC 
oflogic. 


But 
the 
logic 
of 
Leibnitz 
is 
an 
art 
of 
discovery 
() 
as 
well 
as 
of 
proof, 
and, 
as 
such, 
applies 
both 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
reasoning 
and 
to 
that 
of 
fact. 
In 
the 
former 
it 
has 
by 
attention 
to 
render 
explicit 
what 
is 
otherwise 
only 
implicit, 
and 
by 
the 
intellect 
to 
introduce 
order 
into 
the 
a 
priori 
truths 
of 
reason, 
so 
that 
one 
may 
follow 
from 
another 
and 
they 
may 
constitute 
together 
a 
monde 
intellectuel. 
To 
this 
art 
of 
orderly 
combination 
Leibnitz 
attached 
the 
greatest 
importance, 
and 
to 
it 
one 
of 
his 
earliest 
writings 
was 
devoted. 
Similarly, 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
experience, 
it 
is 
the 
business 
of 
the 
art 
of 
discovery 
to 
find 
out 
and 
classify 
the 
primitive 
facts 
or 
data, 
referring 
every 
other 
fact 
to 
them 
as 
itssufficientreason,sothatnewtruthsofexperiencemaybebroughttolight. 


As 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
monad 
when 
clarified 
becomes 
thought, 
so 
the 
appetite 
of 
which 
all 
monads 
partake 
is 
raised 
to 
will, 
their 
spontaneity 
to 
freedom, 
in 
man 
(). 
The 
will 
is 
an 
effort 
or 
tendency 
to 
that 
which 
one 
finds 
good 
(), 
and 
is 
free 
only 
in 
the 
sense 
of 
being 
exempt 
from 
external 
control 
(p, 
513, 
521), 
for 
it 
must 
always 
have 
a 
sufficient 
reason 
for 
its 
action 
determined 
by 
what 
seems 
good 
to 
it. 
The 
end 
determining 
the 
will 
is 
pleasure 
(), 
and 
pleasure 
is 
the 
sense 
of 
an 
increase 
of 
perfection 
(). 
A 
will 
guided 
by 
reason 
will 
sacrifice 
transitory 
and 
pursue 
constant 
pleasures 
or 
happiness, 
and 
in 
this 
weighing 
of 
pleasures 
consists 
true 
wisdom. 
Leibnitz, 
like 
Spinoza, 
says 
that 
freedom 
consists 
in 
following 
reason, 
servitude 
in 
following 
the 
passions 
(), 
and 
that 
the 
passions 
proceed 
from 
confused 
perceptions 
(p, 
269). 
In 
love 
one 
finds 
joy 
in 
the 
happiness 
of 
another; 
and 
from 
love 
follow 
justice 
and 
law. 
“Our 
reason,” 
says 
Leibnitz, 
“illumined 
by 



the 
spirit 
of 
God, 
reveals 
the 
law 
of 
nature,” 
and 
with 
it 
positive 
law 
must 
not 
conflict. 
Natural 
law 
rises 
from 
the 
strict 
command 
to 
avoid 
offence, 
through 
the 
maxim 
of 
equity 
which 
gives 
to 
each 
his 
due, 
to 
that 
of 
probity 
or 
piety 
(honeste 
vivere), 
— 
the 
highest 
ethical 
perfection, 
— 
which 
presupposes 
a 
belief 
in 
God, 
providence 
and 
a 
future 
life. 
Moral 
immortality 
— 
not 
merely 
the 
simple 
continuity 
which 
belongs 
to 
every 
monad 
— 
comes 
from 
God 
having 
provided 
that 
the 
changes 
of 
matter 
will 
not 
make 
man 
lose 
his 
individuality 
(p,466). 


LeibnitzthusmakestheexistenceofGodapostulateof 
moralityas 
wellas 
necessary 
for 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
monads. 
It 
is 
in 
the 
Théodicée 
that 
his 
theology 
is 
worked 
out 
and 
his 
view 
of 
the 
universe 
as 
the 
best 
possible 
world 
defended. 
In 
it 
he 
contends 
that 
faith 
and 
reason 
are 
essentially 
harmonious 
(p, 
479), 
and 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
received 
as 
an 
article 
of 
faith 
which 
contradicts 
an 
eternal 
truth, 
though 
the 
ordinary 
physical 
order 
may 
be 
superseded 
byahigher. 


The 
ordinary 
arguments 
for 
the 
being 
of 
God 
are 
retained 
by 
Leibnitz 
in 
a 
modifiedform(). 
Descartes’sontological 
proof 
issupplementedby 
the 
clause 
that 
God 
as 
the 
ens 
a 
se 
must 
either 
exist 
or 
be 
impossible 
(p, 
177, 
708); 
in 
the 
cosmological 
proof 
he 
passes 
from 
the 
infinite 
series 
of 
finite 
causes 
to 
their 
sufficient 
reason 
which 
contains 
all 
changes 
in 
the 
series 
necessarily 
in 
itself 
(p, 
708); 
and 
he 
argues 
teleologically 
from 
the 
existence 
of 
harmony 
among 
the 
monads 
without 
any 
mutual 
influence 
to 
God 
as 
the 
author 
of 
this 
harmony(). 


In 
these 
proofs 
Leibnitz 
seems 
to 
have 
in 
view 
an 
extramundane 
power 
to 
whom 
the 
monads 
owe 
their 
reality, 
though 
such 
a 
conception 
evidently 
breaks 
the 
continuity 
and 
harmony 
of 
his 
system, 
and 
can 
only 
be 
externally 
connected 
with 
it. 
But 
he 
also 
speaks 
in 
one 
place 
at 
any 
rate 
of 
God 
as 
the 
“universal 
harmony”; 
and 
the 
historians 
Erdmann 
and 
Zeller 
are 
of 
opinion 



that 
this 
is 
theonlysense 
in 
which 
his 
system 
can 
be 
consistentlytheistic. 
Yet 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
to 
assume 
a 
purely 
active 
and 
therefore 
perfect 
monad 
as 
the 
source 
of 
all 
things 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
continuity 
and 
with 
Leibnitz’s 
conception 
of 
the 
gradation 
of 
existences. 
In 
this 
sense 
he 
sometimes 
speaks 
of 
God 
as 
the 
first 
or 
highest 
of 
the 
monads 
(), 
and 
of 
created 
substances 
proceeding 
from 
Him 
continually 
by 
“fulgurations” 
() 
or 
by 
“asortofemanationasweproduceourthoughts.” 


The 
positive 
properties 
or 
perfections 
of 
the 
monads, 
Leibnitz 
holds, 
exist 
eminenter, 
i.e. 
without 
the 
limitation 
that 
attaches 
to 
created 
monads 
(), 
in 
God 
— 
their 
perception 
as 
His 
wisdom 
or 
intellect, 
and 
their 
appetite 
as 
His 
absolute 
will 
or 
goodness 
(); 
while 
the 
absence 
of 
all 
limitation 
is 
the 
divine 
independence 
or 
power, 
which 
again 
consists 
in 
this, 
that 
the 
possibility 
of 
things 
depends 
on 
His 
intellect, 
their 
reality 
on 
His 
will 
(). 
The 
universe 
in 
its 
harmonious 
order 
is 
thus 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
divine 
end, 
and 
as 
such 
must 
be 
the 
best 
possible 
(). 
The 
teleology 
of 
Leibnitz 
becomes 
necessarily 
a 
Théodicée. 
God 
created 
a 
world 
to 
manifest 
and 
communicate 
His 
perfection 
(), 
and, 
in 
choosing 
this 
world 
out 
of 
the 
infinite 
number 
that 
exist 
in 
the 
region 
of 
ideas 
(), 
was 
guided 
by 
the 
principium 
melioris 
(). 
With 
this 
thorough-goingoptimism 
Leibnitz 
has 
to 
reconcile 
the 
existence 
of 
evilinthe 
best 
of 
all 
possible 
worlds. 
With 
this 
end 
in 
view 
he 
distinguishes 
() 
between 


(1) 
metaphysical 
evil 
or 
imperfection, 
which 
is 
unconditionally 
willed 
by 
God 
as 
essential 
to 
created 
beings; 
(2) 
physical 
evil, 
such 
as 
pain, 
which 
is 
conditionally 
willed 
by 
God 
as 
punishment 
or 
as 
a 
means 
to 
greater 
good 
(cf. 
); 
and 
(3) 
moral 
evil, 
in 
which 
the 
great 
difficulty 
lies, 
and 
which 
Leibnitz 
makes 
various 
attempts 
to 
explain. 
He 
says 
that 
it 
was 
merely 
permitted 
not 
willed 
by 
God 
(), 
and, 
that 
being 
obviously 
no 
explanation, 
adds 
that 
it 
was 
permitted 
because 
it 
was 
foreseen 
that 
the 
world 
with 
evil 
would 
nevertheless 
be 
better 
than 
any 
other 
possible 
world 
(). 
He 
also 
speaks 
of 
the 
evil 
as 
a 

mere 
set-off 
to 
the 
good 
in 
the 
world, 
which 
it 
increases 
by 
contrast 
(), 
and 
at 
other 
times 
reduces 
moral 
to 
metaphysical 
evil 
by 
giving 
it 
a 
merely 
negative 
existence, 
or 
says 
that 
their 
evil 
actions 
are 
to 
be 
referred 
to 
men 
alone, 
while 
it 
is 
only 
the 
power 
of 
action 
that 
comes 
from 
God, 
and 
the 
power 
of 
action 
is 
good(). 


The 
great 
problem 
of 
Leibnitz’s 
Théodicée 
thus 
remains 
unsolved. 
The 
suggestion 
that 
evil 
consists 
in 
a 
mere 
imperfection, 
like 
his 
idea 
of 
the 
monads 
proceedingfrom 
God 
by 
a 
continual 
emanation, 
wastoo 
bold 
and 
too 
inconsistent 
with 
his 
immediate 
apologetic 
aim 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
him. 
Had 
he 
done 
so 
his 
theory 
would 
have 
transcended 
the 
independence 
of 
the 
monads 
with 
which 
it 
started, 
and 
found 
a 
deeper 
unity 
in 
the 
world 
than 
that 
resulting 
from 
the 
somewhat 
arbitrary 
assertion 
that 
the 
monads 
reflect 
the 
universe. 


The 
philosophy 
of 
Leibnitz, 
in 
the 
more 
systematic 
and 
abstract 
form 
it 
received 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
Wolf, 
ruled 
the 
schools 
of 
Germany 
for 
nearly 
a 
century, 
and 
largely 
determined 
the 
character 
of 
the 
critical 
philosophy 
by 
which 
it 
was 
superseded. 
On 
it 
Baumgarten 
laid 
the 
foundations 
of 
a 
science 
of 
aesthetic. 
Its 
treatment 
of 
theological 
questions 
heralded 
the 
German 
Aufklärung. 
And 
on 
many 
special 
points 
— 
in 
its 
physical 
doctrine 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
force, 
its 
psychological 
hypothesis 
of 
unconscious 
perception, 
its 
attempt 
at 
a 
logical 
symbolism 
— 
it 
has 
suggested 
ideas

— 
The 
materials 
for 
the 
life 
of 
Leibnitz, 
in 
addition 
to 
his 
own 
works, 
are 
the 
notes 
of 
Eckhart 
(not 
published 
till 
1779), 
the 
Éloge 
by 
Fontenelle 
(read 
to 
the 
French 
Academy 
in 
1717), 
the 
“Eulogium,” 
by 
Wolf, 
in 
the 
Acta 
Eruditorium 
for 
July 
1717,

“Supplementum” 
to 
the 
same 
by 
Feller, 
published 
in 
his

The 
best 
biography 
is 
that

W. 
Freiherr 
von 
Leibnitz 
(2 
vols. 
Breslau, 
1842;
