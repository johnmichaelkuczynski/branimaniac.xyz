### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Guilt by Association**: In "The Farmer and the Cranes," the argument is that one's company can determine one's fate. The Farmer's decision to kill the Stork alongside the Cranes illustrates the moral that association with wrongdoers can lead to shared consequences.

2. **Ingratitude and Betrayal**: "The Farmer and the Snake" argues that acts of kindness towards the ungrateful can lead to harm. The Farmer's death after saving the Snake underscores the moral that some individuals cannot be reformed by kindness alone.

3. **Cowardice and Fear**: "The Fawn and His Mother" posits that inherent traits, such as cowardice, cannot be overcome by rational arguments. The Fawn's mother's fear of dogs despite her advantages illustrates this point.

4. **False Virtue**: "The Bear and the Fox" argues that boasting about virtues that are not genuinely practiced is hypocritical. The Bear's claim of respect for humans is contradicted by his actions, as pointed out by the Fox.

5. **Superficiality**: "The Swallow and the Crow" suggests that superficial qualities, such as appearance, are less important than practical utility. The Crow's feathers, which protect against winter, are more valuable than the Swallow's spring plumage.

2. **Compassion and Its Limits**: "The Farmer and the Snake" implies that compassion should be tempered with caution, as not all recipients of kindness will respond positively.

3. **Inherent Traits**: "The Fawn and His Mother" implies that some traits, such as cowardice, are inherent and cannot be changed by external arguments or encouragement.

4. **Hypocrisy**: "The Bear and the Fox" suggests that hypocrisy is easily exposed and criticized by others, as seen in the Fox's response to the Bear's boasts.

5. **Practicality Over Aesthetics**: "The Swallow and the Crow" implies that practical considerations should outweigh aesthetic ones, as the Crow's feathers are more useful than the Swallow's.

6. **Perspective and Proportion**: "The Mountain in Labor" suggests that maintaining perspective and proportion is important in assessing the significance of events.
