Here are 25 key positions (theses, arguments, or philosophical claims) that can be found in each of David Hume’s major philosophical works. I’ve selected the four works most commonly regarded as his core philosophical contributions and listed distinct positions for each.

### A Treatise of Human Nature (1739–1740)

1. All perceptions of the mind are either impressions or ideas.
2. Ideas are faint copies of impressions.

Here are 100 position statements from Hume's Natural History of Religion:
Origins of Religion

Religion did not originate from rational contemplation of the design or order of nature.
The earliest form of religion among humans was polytheism, not monotheism.
Monotheism is a later historical development that emerged from polytheism.
The claim that monotheism was humanity's original religion is historically unfounded.
Ancient historical records universally attest to polytheistic origins of religion.
No nation achieved monotheism prior to the development of arts and sciences.
The vulgar and uneducated masses naturally incline toward polytheism.
Theism requires a sophistication of thought absent in primitive conditions.
Idolatry universally preceded theism in all nations for which we have records.
The notion of a single supreme deity is not intuitive or natural to the untutored mind.

Psychological Sources of Religion

Fear is the primary psychological source of religious belief.
Hope regarding uncertain future events drives humans toward religion.
Anxiety about survival and wellbeing generates religious sentiments.
The unknown causes of events in nature provoke religious speculation.
Humans personify the unknown causes of fortune and misfortune.
People project human qualities onto invisible powers that affect their lives.
Self-interested concern with happiness and misery motivates religious belief.
The ordinary affairs of life—health, sickness, weather—first prompted religious ideas.
Abstract contemplation of nature's order was not the original source of religion.
Humans attend first to what immediately affects their wellbeing, not cosmic design.

The Role of Ignorance

Ignorance of natural causes is the principal source of religion.
The more ignorant a people, the more superstitious they tend to be.
Scientific understanding diminishes the hold of superstition.
Early humans attributed agency to natural phenomena they could not explain.
The irregular and unpredictable events of life especially prompt religious attribution.
Where causes are known, humans do not invoke supernatural agency.
The unknown is naturally filled with invisible intelligent powers.
Humans cannot long remain in suspense about unknown causes affecting them.
The imagination supplies gods where understanding cannot supply causes.
Education and inquiry weaken superstitious tendencies.

Anthropomorphism

Humans universally conceive gods in their own image.
Anthropomorphism is the natural tendency in all religious thought.
Even abstract theological concepts retain anthropomorphic residues.
The gods are assigned human passions, desires, and motives.
The attribution of human form to deities is nearly universal.
Animals, plants, and objects became gods through personification.
Every aspect of nature became inhabited by spirits resembling humans.
The propensity to anthropomorphize is deeply rooted in human nature.
Humans find agency and intention wherever they perceive effects.
We project our own mental operations onto external causes.

Polytheism and Its Character

Polytheism distributes divine power among multiple limited beings.
The gods of polytheism are conceived as similar to humans but more powerful.
Polytheistic gods have particular provinces, domains, and limitations.
Polytheism is more tolerant than monotheism of diverse religious practices.
Polytheistic societies readily incorporated foreign gods into their pantheons.
The gods of polytheism are not infinitely perfect or omnipotent.
Polytheism permits a comfortable familiarity between humans and gods.
The behavior attributed to polytheistic gods is often morally questionable.
Polytheism does not demand exclusive devotion to one deity.
Allegiance in polytheism shifts based on circumstances and needs.

The Rise of Monotheism

Monotheism arose from competitive exaltation of particular deities.
Flattery of favored gods gradually elevated them above all others.
The rhetoric of praise naturally tends toward superlatives and ultimacy.
One god becomes supreme through the diminution of rivals.
Monotheism represents an endpoint in the logic of divine adulation.
The transition from polytheism to monotheism is gradual, not sudden.
Fear drives humans to magnify the power of their chosen deity.
The desire for divine favor leads to ever-greater attributions of power.
Monotheism retains vestiges of polytheism in angels, saints, and demons.
The popular religion even in monotheistic cultures resembles polytheism.

Flux Between Polytheism and Monotheism

Religion naturally oscillates between polytheistic and monotheistic tendencies.
The abstraction of monotheism is difficult for ordinary minds to sustain.
Humans need mediating figures between themselves and an infinite deity.
The veneration of saints represents a return toward polytheistic sentiment.
Popular religion constantly reintroduces plurality into official monotheism.
The flux between unity and plurality is inherent in religious psychology.
Philosophical theism cannot maintain itself among the general populace.
Devotion requires objects more tangible than an abstract supreme being.
The tendency toward anthropomorphic plurality reasserts itself continually.
What is officially monotheism becomes practical polytheism in popular practice.

Comparison of Polytheism and Monotheism

Polytheism is more tolerant; monotheism more prone to persecution.
Monotheism makes stronger claims and therefore breeds fiercer conflict.
Exclusive devotion to one god generates intolerance of other religions.
Polytheism lacks the doctrinal rigidity that produces religious violence.
Monotheism's greater philosophical coherence comes with social costs.
The unity of God generates sectarian disputes about God's true nature.
Polytheism allowed diverse peoples to coexist religiously.
Monotheistic zeal has produced more cruelty than polytheistic laxity.
Persecution for religious belief was rare in polytheistic antiquity.
The exclusive claims of monotheism make religious pluralism difficult.

Religion and Morality

Popular religion has little positive effect on morality.
Religious devotion is often substituted for genuine moral virtue.
The observances of religion frequently displace ethical behavior.
Superstition can make crimes appear as piety when done for religious ends.
Gods are worshipped more through ritual than through moral conduct.
Frivolous practices are often treated as more important than justice or benevolence.
Religion and morality have historically had an uneasy relationship.
Theological virtues often conflict with natural moral virtues.
Self-denial and austerity are praised beyond social virtues.
Religion can corrupt morality by introducing strange new duties.

Religion and Human Nature

Religious belief arises from universal features of human psychology.
The sources of religion are natural, not supernatural.
Religion should be studied as a natural phenomenon like any other.
Human nature inevitably generates religious ideas under certain conditions.
The religious impulse is not evidence for the truth of religious claims.
Understanding how religion arises is distinct from evaluating its truth.
The causes of religious belief do not validate its content.
Religion reflects the human condition more than cosmic reality.
The study of religion belongs to psychology and history, not theology.
The natural history of religion reveals human nature, not divine nature.

 HUME ON ECONOMICS 

Money is not the wheel of trade but only its oil or instrument.
An increase in money, with quantities of labor and commodities fixed, merely raises prices proportionally.
The quantity theory of money: prices are in proportion to the quantity of money in circulation.
A gradual increase in money stimulates industry before prices fully adjust.
Sudden increases in money cause temporary prosperity followed by higher prices.
All augmentations of money are ultimately neutral in real terms but beneficial if slow.
Luxury is not injurious to a state but rather promotes industry and refinement.
Refinement in the arts (luxury) increases labor demand and raises wages.
Consumption of luxuries encourages invention, arts, and economic activity.
Frugality in individuals may be virtuous, but general frugality contracts commerce.
Interest rates are determined primarily by the demand and supply of borrowing, not by the quantity of money.
High profits on capital, not abundance of money, are the true cause of high interest rates.
Low interest rates result from increased commerce and accumulation of capital.
In a commercial society, interest rates naturally fall over time.
The balance of trade is not a reliable indicator of national prosperity.
An unfavorable balance of trade automatically corrects itself via the specie-flow mechanism.
When a nation exports more than it imports, specie flows in, raising prices and restoring equilibrium.
Attempts to hoard specie by prohibiting export are futile and harmful.
Free trade is generally more advantageous than protectionist policies.
Jealousy of trade among nations is based on mistaken zero-sum assumptions.
Every nation benefits from the economic prosperity of its neighbors.
Rich trading nations are the best customers and suppliers for others.
Tariffs and trade restrictions usually harm the country that imposes them.
The wealth of a nation consists in the abundance of commodities and labor, not in gold and silver.
Bullion and coin are merely conventional representations of real wealth.
Public credit (government debt) can be useful in emergencies but dangerous when excessive.
Perpetual public debt transfers wealth from industrious citizens to idle stockholders.
Heavy taxation to service public debt discourages industry and population growth.
Voluntary national bankruptcy would ruin credit and should be avoided.
A growing public debt ultimately leads to higher taxes or debasement of currency.
Taxes on consumption are generally preferable to taxes on land or capital.
Taxes should be certain, convenient, and proportionate to ability to pay.
Indirect taxes (excises) are less felt and often less burdensome than direct ones.
High wages are a sign of national prosperity, not distress.
Low wages result from scarcity of labor or lack of demand for it.
Population tends to adjust to the demand for labor and means of subsistence.
A flourishing economy naturally increases population.
Ancient nations were not more populous than modern ones; evidence suggests the contrary.
Slavery and political oppression in antiquity reduced effective population.
Modern European liberty and security of property encourage greater populousness.
Commerce enlarges the market and encourages division of labor.
Division of labor increases productivity and national wealth.
Manufactures and commerce mutually support each other.
Agriculture benefits from proximity to manufacturing and commercial towns.
Enclosure and improvement of land are promoted by commercial demand.
Paper credit and banking facilitate commerce by economizing on specie.
Banks of circulation (note-issuing) are beneficial when properly managed.
Excessive issue of paper money causes inflation and harms trade.
International lending and borrowing equalize interest rates across nations.
Capital flows to where profits are highest, equalizing returns over time.
No nation can long remain both creditor and manufacturer to the world.
The riches of a nation are measured by the annual produce of its labor and industry.
Foreign trade multiplies domestic goods by exchanging superfluities for necessities or conveniences.
Protection of infant industries may sometimes be justified temporarily.
Navigation acts favoring domestic shipping can be advantageous despite restricting trade.
Colonies enrich the mother country by extending its commerce.
Exclusive colonial trade privileges are beneficial to the metropolis.
Free ports and entrepôts increase national commerce.
Monopolies granted to trading companies are generally pernicious.
Bounties on exports usually waste public revenue without real benefit.
Drawing prizes (lotteries) for public loans encourage excessive borrowing.
Sinking funds for debt repayment are often illusory and mismanaged.
A national debt may act as a kind of political mortgage binding citizens to government.
In a commercial state, the middle class becomes the most numerous and influential.
Commerce softens manners and promotes humanity.
Industry, knowledge, and humanity are linked by inseparable bonds.
The spirit of the age tends toward greater economic liberty.
Absolute governments are less favorable to commerce than free ones.
Moderate taxation encourages industry; oppressive taxation destroys it.
Sumptuary laws attempting to restrain luxury are ineffective and harmful.
Fashion and taste changes stimulate continual demand for labor.
The desire for luxuries spreads from the rich downward through society.
Artisans and merchants gain most from refined consumption.
A large stock of capital is necessary for extensive division of labor.
Capital accumulation lowers profits and interest rates over time.
The rate of profit tends toward equality across different employments.
Money is distributed among nations according to their industry and commerce.
No nation can acquire excessive specie relative to its economic activity.
Price levels naturally adjust to the quantity of money and velocity of circulation.
Velocity of money increases in commercial societies.
Banks increase the effective velocity of money.
Low interest encourages investment in land improvement.
High interest discourages long-term agricultural projects.
The natural progress of opulence is from agriculture to manufactures to foreign trade.
Many European policies reverse this natural order to the detriment of wealth.
Freedom of trade within a country is essential for prosperity.
Internal tolls and customs hinder domestic commerce.
Standardization of weights, measures, and coinage facilitates exchange.
Good roads, canals, and communication promote economic integration.
Invention and improvement flourish most under commercial liberty.
The law of one price tends to prevail across connected markets.
Arbitrage equalizes commodity prices internationally.
Exchange rates fluctuate around the specie points determined by transport costs.
Bills of exchange are the true balance of trade mechanism.
A general scarcity of money is impossible in a commercial world.
Particular scarcities arise only from temporary disruptions.
Public granaries to stabilize grain prices usually do more harm than good.
The corn bounty encourages tillage but at excessive public cost.
Economic prosperity depends more on institutions and manners than on natural resources.
The same principles of political economy apply universally, though modified by particular circumstances.
Here are another 100 distinct positions, theses, arguments, or claims on economics from David Hume’s writings (again drawn primarily from the economic essays in **Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary**, with some additional nuance and lesser-known points from related essays such as “Of the Jealousy of Trade,” “Of Civil Liberty,” “Of the Origin of Government,” and scattered remarks in his **History of England** and letters).
