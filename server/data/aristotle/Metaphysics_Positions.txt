ARISTOTLE: METAPHYSICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE SCIENCE OF BEING QUA BEING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There is a science that studies BEING QUA BEING—not any particular kind of being, but what it is to be at all, and the attributes that belong to being as such.

• This science also studies FIRST PRINCIPLES AND HIGHEST CAUSES—it is first philosophy, architectonic over all particular sciences.

• Metaphysics is WISDOM (sophia) in the highest sense—knowledge of first causes and principles, pursued for its own sake, making us free rather than servile to practical needs.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SUBSTANCE (OUSIA)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SUBSTANCE (ousia) IS THE PRIMARY SENSE OF BEING—all other categories (quality, quantity, relation, etc.) depend on substance for their existence.

• The question "what is being?" reduces to the question "WHAT IS SUBSTANCE?"—this is the central inquiry of metaphysics.

• SUBSTANCE IS THAT WHICH IS NEITHER SAID OF NOR PRESENT IN A SUBJECT—it is the ultimate subject of predication that underlies all else.

• Candidates for substance include MATTER, FORM, AND THE COMPOSITE—Aristotle argues that form has the best claim to being substance in the primary sense.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FORM AND MATTER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• FORM IS THE "WHAT IT WAS TO BE" (to ti ēn einai)—the essence that makes a thing what it is and answers the question "what is it?"

• MATTER IS PURE POTENTIALITY—it is unknowable in itself and becomes determinate only through form.

• DEFINITION EXPRESSES ESSENCE—proper definitions state the form, articulating genus and differentia until the infima species is reached.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AGAINST PLATONIC FORMS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• UNIVERSALS ARE NOT SUBSTANCES—against Plato, Aristotle argues that no universal (animal, color) exists separately; only particulars are fully real.

• PLATONIC FORMS ARE UNNECESSARY AND EXPLANATORILY IMPOTENT—positing a separate Form of Man does not explain how particular men exist or come to be.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ACTUALITY AND POTENTIALITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• ACTUALITY (energeia) IS PRIOR TO POTENTIALITY (dynamis)—in definition, time, and substance; the actual is what the potential is for.

• UNITY AND BEING ARE CONVERTIBLE—whatever is, is one; the senses of unity correspond to the senses of being.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE PRIME MOVER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The PRIME MOVER IS PURE ACTUALITY—eternal, immaterial, unchanging, without potentiality; it is thought thinking itself.

• The prime mover causes motion as FINAL CAUSE—it moves by being loved, as the object of desire and aspiration for the celestial spheres.

• There are MULTIPLE UNMOVED MOVERS—one for each celestial sphere, though the outermost sphere's mover is primary.

• THEOLOGY IS FIRST PHILOSOPHY—the study of the divine, immaterial, and eternal is the highest and most honorable science.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-CONTRADICTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The PRINCIPLE OF NON-CONTRADICTION is the firmest of all principles—the same attribute cannot both belong and not belong to the same subject in the same respect.

• The principle of non-contradiction CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED (that would be circular) but can be defended elenctically—anyone who denies it, in speaking meaningfully, presupposes it.
