ARISTOTLE: PHYSICS BOOK I - PRINCIPLES OF NATURE
Positions and Core Arguments

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE THREE PRINCIPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The principles are three: form, privation, and substratum (matter).

• First only the contraries were principles, but later a substratum was found indispensable, making the principles three.

• The principles are three, and in what sense, and the way in which each is a principle, is clear.

• The form and its contrary (privation) constitute one type of principle, while the substratum constitutes another.

• Whether the form or the substratum is the essential nature of a physical object is not yet clear—this requires further investigation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MATTER AND SUBSTANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Matter is nearly, in a sense is, substance, while the privation in no sense is.

• The substratum is that which persists through changes, and it is the underlying reality of natural objects.

• The one which persists is a joint cause, with the form, of what comes to be—a mother, as it were.

• The matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense, while in another it does not.

• As that which contains the privation, matter ceases to be in its own nature, for what ceases to be—the privation—is contained within it.

• Matter provides the potentiality for change, while form actualizes that potential.

CRITIQUE OF EARLIER PHILOSOPHERS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The first of those who studied science were misled in their search for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were thrust them into another path.

• The early thinkers say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not—both of which they think impossible.

• They got so far as to see that there must be some underlying nature, but they make it one—for even if one philosopher makes a dyad of it, which he calls Great and Small, the effect is the same, for he overlooked the other nature.

• Their triad (the Platonists') is therefore of quite a different kind from ours—they identify their Great and Small alike with not being.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BEING AND BECOMING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The phrases 'something comes to be from what is or from what is not' are to be taken in the same sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him'—referring to the subject in its accidental capacity.

• A thing 'comes to be' in an unqualified sense when it comes to be something in its own right, and not merely in some qualified way.

• Only substances 'come to be' in the unqualified sense.

• The distinction between qualified and unqualified becoming helps clarify the nature of change and the role of the substratum.

• Change involves a transition from one state to its opposite, such as from hot to cold or from wet to dry.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MATTER'S DESIRE FOR FORM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Admitting with the Platonists that there is something divine, good, and desirable, we hold that there are two other principles: one contrary to it, the other such as of its own nature to desire and yearn for it.

• The truth is that what desires the form is matter, as the female desires the male and the ugly the beautiful—only the ugly or the female not per se but per accidens.

• The negative part of the contrariety may often seem, if you concentrate your attention on it as an evil agent, not to exist at all.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The difficulty of the early thinkers, as well as our own, is solved in this way alone—by distinguishing the three principles.

• The nature of becoming can be understood through the concept of a substratum, which persists through changes.

• Examples from nature (bronze and statue, wood and bed, animals and plants from seeds) illustrate how matter and form work together in becoming.

• The growth of animals and plants from seeds illustrates the persistence of something through the process of becoming.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HYLOMORPHISM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Natural objects are composed of matter and form—these principles are essential for understanding becoming.

• All substances are composites of matter and form.

• Matter is the potentiality for change; form is the actuality of that change.

• The substratum ontology holds that an underlying something persists through all changes.

• Understanding natural objects requires grasping both their material and formal causes.
