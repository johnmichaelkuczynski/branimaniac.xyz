ARISTOTLE: PARVA NATURALIA (SHORT TREATISES ON NATURAL PHILOSOPHY)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCOPE: SOUL-BODY PHENOMENA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The Parva Naturalia treats phenomena COMMON TO SOUL AND BODY—states that involve psychic capacities but depend essentially on bodily conditions.

• All these phenomena reveal the INTIMATE UNION OF SOUL AND BODY—psychic activities are realized in and through physiological processes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SENSE AND SENSIBILIA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The sensible qualities (colors, sounds, odors, flavors, tangible qualities) are OBJECTIVE FEATURES OF BODIES, not mere subjective affections.

• COLOR is the visible quality of what is visible in itself; it is located at the surface of bodies and requires a transparent medium (light) for perception.

• The number of basic colors is FINITE AND DETERMINATE—intermediate colors arise from mixture of extremes (white and black).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MEMORY AND RECOLLECTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• MEMORY is the possession of an image as a likeness of that of which it is an image—it involves a representational reference to the past.

• Memory belongs to the SAME PART OF THE SOUL AS IMAGINATION—it requires phantasmata (mental images).

• MEMORY IS ESSENTIALLY OF THE PAST—one cannot remember present perceptions or future expectations; memory intrinsically involves temporal distance.

• RECOLLECTION (anamnesis) differs from memory—it is an active search, a quasi-inferential recovery of what was known, moving through associated images.

• Recollection proceeds by ASSOCIATION: similarity, contrariety, and contiguity guide the search through the sequence of phantasmata.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SLEEP AND WAKING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SLEEP is a natural state involving the incapacitation of the primary sense organ—the heart in Aristotle's physiology.

• Sleep results from EVAPORATION OF NUTRIMENT—warm vapors rise to the head, cool, and descend, causing loss of perceptual awareness.

• Sleep is FOR THE SAKE OF PRESERVATION—it rests the sense organs and restores the animal's capacity for waking activity.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DREAMS AND DIVINATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• DREAMS are movements of phantasia occurring during sleep—residual motions from waking perception that persist and become vivid when external sensation ceases.

• Dreams are NOT DIVINE PROPHECIES—they are natural phenomena explicable by the mechanics of sense-imagery.

• Some dreams may coincidentally match future events by CHANCE, or the dream may serve as a STARTING POINT that influences subsequent action, or the dreamer may perceive SUBTLE BODILY SIGNS that portend illness.

• Most apparently prophetic dreams are coincidences; true divine dreams would require explaining why the gods send them to ordinary people rather than the wise.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LIFE, DEATH, AND RESPIRATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Longevity correlates with the BALANCE AND QUALITY OF THE ORGANISM'S VITAL HEAT AND MOISTURE—different species have different natural lifespans.

• Life depends on INNATE HEAT CENTERED IN THE HEART; death occurs when this heat is exhausted or extinguished.

• BREATHING SERVES TO COOL THE VITAL HEAT—animals that breathe maintain their heat within viable limits through this refrigeration.
