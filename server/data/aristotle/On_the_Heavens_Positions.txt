ARISTOTLE: ON THE HEAVENS (DE CAELO)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE COSMOS AS A WHOLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The COSMOS IS A FINITE, SPHERICAL, AND ETERNAL WHOLE—it has no beginning and no end in time.

• There are TWO DISTINCT REGIONS OF THE COSMOS: the superlunary (heavens) and the sublunary (terrestrial).

• The COSMOS IS UNIQUE—there cannot be multiple worlds, because all matter of each element would naturally collect in a single cosmic center.

• There is NOTHING OUTSIDE THE COSMOS—no void, no body, no place, no time beyond the outermost sphere.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE FIFTH ELEMENT (AETHER)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The heavenly bodies are composed of a FIFTH ELEMENT (AETHER)—distinct from earth, water, air, and fire, and not subject to generation or corruption.

• Aether's natural motion is ETERNAL CIRCULAR LOCOMOTION—unlike the rectilinear motion natural to the four terrestrial elements.

• CIRCULAR MOTION IS PRIOR TO AND MORE PERFECT THAN RECTILINEAR MOTION—it alone can be continuous, uniform, and eternal.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE HEAVENS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The HEAVENS ARE ETERNAL AND UNCHANGEABLE—the celestial realm admits no generation, corruption, growth, or alteration.

• The STARS AND PLANETS ARE DIVINE BEINGS—their eternal circular motion reflects their perfection and divinity.

• The celestial spheres are ANIMATE AND ENSOULED—their motion is voluntary activity, not mechanical compulsion.

• The ORDER AND REGULARITY OF CELESTIAL MOTION evidences cosmic rationality—the heavens manifest an intelligible, purposive structure.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE EARTH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The EARTH IS SPHERICAL—demonstrated by the shape of its shadow on the moon during eclipses and by the changing visibility of stars as one travels north or south.

• The EARTH IS AT REST AT THE CENTER OF THE COSMOS—it does not rotate or revolve; the heavens revolve around it.

• Earth rests at the center BY NATURE, NOT BY CONSTRAINT—heavy elements naturally move toward the center; earth has nowhere further to fall.

• The SIZE OF THE EARTH IS RELATIVELY SMALL compared to the celestial spheres—Aristotle cites mathematicians' estimates of its circumference.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE FOUR TERRESTRIAL ELEMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The four TERRESTRIAL ELEMENTS have natural rectilinear motions: earth and water move downward (toward center), fire and air move upward (toward periphery).

• HEAVINESS AND LIGHTNESS ARE NATURAL TENDENCIES, not relational properties—earth is absolutely heavy, fire absolutely light.

• Each element has a NATURAL PLACE to which it moves and in which it rests unless impeded.

• The elements can TRANSFORM INTO ONE ANOTHER through qualitative change—unlike aether, which is immutable.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AGAINST THE ATOMISTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Against the atomists: INDIVISIBLE MAGNITUDES AND INFINITE VOID ARE IMPOSSIBLE—the cosmos is continuous and plenum.

• Physics must explain through FINAL AS WELL AS EFFICIENT CAUSES—the purposive structure of the heavens demands teleological explanation.
