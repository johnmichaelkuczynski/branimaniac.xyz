## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that all instances of becoming or change involve an underlying substratum that persists through the change, and that this substratum, along with form and privation, constitutes the principles of natural objects subject to generation.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument for the Existence of a Substratum**:
   - The text argues that in all cases of becoming, there must be something that underlies the change, which remains numerically one but can be described in different ways. This is supported by examples such as a man becoming musical, where the man remains the same while the attribute changes.
   - "man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what is not musical or is unmusical does not continue to exist, either simply or combined with the subject."

2. **Argument for the Distinction Between Subject and Opposite**:
   - The text distinguishes between the subject (e.g., man) and the opposite (e.g., unmusical), asserting that the subject persists while the opposite does not. This is illustrated by the example of a man becoming musical, where the man remains but the unmusical attribute does not.
   - "One part survives, the other does not: what is not an opposite survives (for 'man' survives), but 'not-musical' or 'unmusical' does not survive, nor does the compound of the two, namely 'unmusical man'."

3. **Argument for the Complexity of Becoming**:
   - The text argues that becoming is always complex, involving something that comes into existence and something that becomes that, either the subject or the opposite. This is supported by various examples of change, such as a statue coming to be from bronze.
   - "Thus, clearly, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always complex. There is, on the one hand, (a) something which comes into existence, and again (b) something which becomes that-the latter (b) in two senses, either the subject or the opposite."

4. **Argument for the Principles of Natural Objects**:
   - The text posits that natural objects come to be from both a subject and a form, and that these, along with privation, constitute the principles of natural objects. This is supported by the analysis of 'musical man' as composed of 'man' and 'musical'.
   - "Plainly then, if there are conditions and principles which constitute natural objects and from which they primarily are or have come to be... plainly, I say, everything comes to be from both subject and form."

5. **Argument for the Number of Principles**:
   - The text argues that the principles of natural objects can be considered as two (subject and form) or three (subject, form, and privation), depending on the perspective. This is supported by the discussion of contraries and the underlying substratum.
   - "There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three..."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim on the Use of Language**:
   - The text claims that the way we speak about becoming reflects the underlying reality of change, with different expressions used depending on whether the subject or the opposite survives the change.
   - "We speak of 'becoming that from this' instead of 'this becoming that' more in the case of what does not survive the change..."

2. **Subsidiary Claim on the Nature of Substances**:
   - The text asserts that only substances are said to 'come to be' in the unqualified sense, while other categories (quantity, quality, relation, etc.) require a subject.
   - "Only substances are said to 'come to be' in the unqualified sense."

3. **Subsidiary Claim on Different Ways of Coming to Be**:
   - The text identifies five different ways in which things come to be: by change of shape, addition, taking away, putting together, and alteration. This supports the main thesis by illustrating the variety of changes that require an underlying substratum.
   - "Generally things which come to be, come to be in different ways: (1) by change of shape, as a statue; (2) by addition, as things which grow; (3) by taking away, as the Hermes from the stone; (4) by putting together, as a house; (5) by alteration, as things which 'turn' in respect of their material substance."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption of Realism**: The text assumes a realist position, where the underlying substratum and the principles of natural objects are considered to have an objective existence.

2. **Assumption of Categorical Distinctions**: The text assumes clear distinctions between categories such as substance, quantity, quality, and relation, which are foundational to its arguments about becoming.

3. **Assumption of the Persistence of Substratum**: The text assumes that the substratum persists through changes, which is crucial to its argument that there must always be an underlying something in cases of becoming.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument follows a deductive structure, starting from general principles about the nature of change and substance, and then applying these principles to specific cases to draw conclusions about the underlying nature of becoming. The argument progresses from the general to the specific, using examples to illustrate and support the main thesis.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction of the Concept of Substratum**: The text begins by introducing the concept of an underlying substratum that persists through changes, using the example of a man becoming musical.

2. **Distinction Between Subject and Opposite**: It then elaborates on the distinction between the subject and the opposite, explaining how the subject survives while the opposite does not.

3. **Complexity of Becoming**: The text further develops the argument by discussing the complexity of becoming, involving both something that comes into existence and something that becomes that.

4. **Principles of Natural Objects**: It then applies these concepts to natural objects, arguing that they come to be from both a subject and a form, and that these, along with privation, constitute the principles of natural objects.

5. **Number of Principles**: Finally, the text concludes by discussing the number of principles, arguing that they can be considered as two or three depending on the perspective, and reinforcing the main thesis about the underlying nature of becoming.

## SECTION 7: CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS

### 7.1 Key Terms and Their Definitions

1. **Substratum**: The underlying something that persists through changes. It is numerically one but can be described in different ways.
   - "there must always be an underlying something, namely that which becomes, and that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one."

2. **Subject**: The entity that persists through changes, such as 'man' in the example of a man becoming musical.
   - "By the 'subject' 'man', and similarly I call the bronze or stone or gold the 'subject'."

3. **Opposite**: The attribute that does not persist through changes, such as 'unmusical' in the example of a man becoming musical.
   - "By the 'opposite' I mean the 'unmusical', and similarly I call the absence of shape or form or order the 'opposite'."

4. **Becoming**: The process of change or transformation, which involves an underlying substratum and the coming into existence of something new.
   - "We speak of 'becoming that from this' instead of 'this becoming that' more in the case of what does not survive the change..."

5. **Coming to Be**: The process by which substances and other entities come into existence, distinguished from becoming in that only substances 'come to be' in the unqualified sense.
   - "Only substances are said to 'come to be' in the unqualified sense."

### 7.2 Technical Vocabulary Introduced or Employed

1. **Hylomorphism**: The theory that all substances are composed of matter and form.
   - "For 'musical man' is composed (in a way) of 'man' and 'musical': you can analyse it into the definitions of its elements."

2. **Privation**: The absence of a form or attribute, considered as one of the principles of natural objects.
   - "the privation, on the other hand, and the contrary are incidental in the process."

### 7.3 Distinctions Drawn Between Related Concepts

1. **Subject vs. Opposite**: The text distinguishes between the subject, which persists through changes, and the opposite, which does not.
   - "One part survives, the other does not: what is not an opposite survives (for 'man' survives), but 'not-musical' or 'unmusical' does not survive..."

2. **Becoming vs. Coming to Be**: The text distinguishes between becoming, which involves an underlying substratum and the coming into existence of something new, and coming to be, which is used specifically for substances.
   - "But there are different senses of 'coming to be'. In some cases we do not use the expression 'come to be', but 'come to be so-and-so'."

### 7.4 Theoretical Innovations or Neologisms

1. **Theoretical Innovation on the Number of Principles**: The text innovates by arguing that the principles of natural objects can be considered as two (subject and form) or three (subject, form, and privation), depending on the perspective.
   - "There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three..."

### 7.5 Repurposing of Existing Concepts

1. **Repurposing of Aristotelian Concepts**: The text repurposes Aristotelian concepts like hylomorphism and substance theory to argue for the existence of an underlying substratum and the principles of natural objects.
   - "For 'musical man' is composed (in a way) of 'man' and 'musical': you can analyse it into the definitions of its elements."

## SECTION 8: ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation:**
   - Matter is nearly, in a sense, substance, while privation is not substance at all. Aristotle's triad of principles (matter, form, and privation) differs fundamentally from the Pythagorean and Platonic triad (Great, Small, and One).

2. **Secondary Formulation:**
   - There are two other principles besides the divine, good, and desirable: one contrary to it and another that desires and yearns for it. Matter is the principle that desires form, akin to the female desiring the male.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Matter as Substance:**
   - Matter is described as the primary substratum of each thing, persisting in the result of change. It is a joint cause with form in the generation of substances, likened to a mother.
   - **Explanation:** Aristotle argues that matter is essential for the existence of substances because it provides the underlying potentiality for change and persistence. Without matter, there could be no transformation or continuity in the natural world.

2. **Privation as Non-Substance:**
   - Privation is not a substance but a lack or absence within matter. It ceases to be in its own nature when considered as an evil agent.
   - **Explanation:** Aristotle distinguishes privation from substance by emphasizing that it is not a positive entity but a negation or absence. This absence is contained within matter and does not persist independently.

3. **Contrast with Pythagorean and Platonic Triads:**
   - The Pythagorean and Platonic triads (Great, Small, and One) are fundamentally different from Aristotle's triad (matter, form, privation) because they identify the Great and Small with non-being.
   - **Explanation:** Aristotle critiques the Pythagorean and Platonic views for failing to recognize the distinct nature of matter and form. He argues that their triad lacks the necessary differentiation between positive and negative principles.

4. **Desire and Yearning for Form:**
   - Matter desires form, analogous to the female desiring the male or the ugly desiring the beautiful. This desire is not per se but per accidens.
   - **Explanation:** Aristotle uses the analogy of desire to explain the relationship between matter and form. Matter, as potentiality, seeks to actualize itself through form, which is the principle of actuality.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Nature as a Principle of Motion and Rest:**
   - Natural objects have an innate principle of motion and rest, distinguishing them from artificial objects.
   - **Explanation:** This argument supports the broader thesis by establishing the foundational role of nature in the physical world, which is composed of matter and form.

2. **Matter's Dual Nature:**
   - Matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense but does not in another. As potentiality, it is outside the sphere of becoming and ceasing to be.
   - **Explanation:** This claim elaborates on the nature of matter, highlighting its dual role as both a substratum for change and a persistent potentiality.

3. **Form as the Primary Principle of Science:**
   - The accurate determination of the first principle in respect of form is the province of the primary type of science.
   - **Explanation:** This argument underscores the importance of form in Aristotle's metaphysical framework, positioning it as a central concern of philosophical inquiry.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Existence of a Divine Principle:**
   - The text assumes the existence of something divine, good, and desirable, which serves as a benchmark for other principles.

2. **Reality of Change and Persistence:**
   - The arguments presuppose that change and persistence are fundamental aspects of the natural world, necessitating the concepts of matter and form.

3. **Distinction Between Natural and Artificial:**
   - There is an implicit assumption that natural objects and processes are fundamentally different from artificial ones, based on their inherent principles of motion and rest.
