ARISTOTLE: SOPHISTICAL REFUTATIONS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GENUINE VS. APPARENT REFUTATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• This work concerns APPARENT BUT NOT GENUINE REFUTATIONS—arguments that seem to refute but do not actually establish a contradiction.

• A genuine REFUTATION (elenchus) is a syllogism that establishes the contradictory of a given thesis; sophistical refutations only appear to do this.

• Sophistry is the APPEARANCE OF WISDOM WITHOUT THE REALITY; the sophist trades in apparent rather than genuine arguments.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE THIRTEEN TYPES OF FALLACY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are exactly THIRTEEN TYPES OF FALLACY, divided into two main classes.

• SIX FALLACIES DEPEND ON LANGUAGE (in dictione): homonymy, amphiboly, combination, division, accent, and form of expression.

• SEVEN FALLACIES ARE INDEPENDENT OF LANGUAGE (extra dictionem): accident, secundum quid, ignoratio elenchi, begging the question, consequent, non-cause as cause, and many questions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FALLACIES DEPENDENT ON LANGUAGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• HOMONYMY occurs when a word has multiple meanings and the argument exploits this ambiguity at the term level.

• AMPHIBOLY occurs when a whole phrase or sentence admits multiple interpretations due to grammatical structure.

• COMBINATION AND DIVISION involve shifting how words are grouped together or separated across premises and conclusion.

• ACCENT (in Greek) involves exploitation of differences in breathing or pitch that alter meaning.

• FORM OF EXPRESSION occurs when grammatical similarity suggests ontological similarity—treating a quality-word as if it named a substance.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FALLACIES INDEPENDENT OF LANGUAGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The fallacy of ACCIDENT illegitimately transfers a predicate from a subject to something accidentally related to that subject.

• SECUNDUM QUID ignores a qualification—what is true in a certain respect is treated as true absolutely.

• IGNORATIO ELENCHI occurs when one refutes something other than the thesis actually maintained—missing the point.

• BEGGING THE QUESTION (petitio principii) occurs when the premise assumes what was to be proved, either directly or through equivalents.

• The fallacy of the CONSEQUENT illicitly infers the antecedent from the consequent or converts a universal affirmative simply.

• NON-CAUSE AS CAUSE treats as essential to the refutation a premise that plays no genuine role in deriving the contradiction.

• MANY QUESTIONS disguises multiple questions as one, extracting a single answer that commits the respondent to more than intended.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOLUTION AND PHILOSOPHICAL IMPORTANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The SOLUTION TO EACH FALLACY consists in identifying which of the thirteen types it instantiates and showing precisely where the appearance of validity breaks down.

• Dialectical training in recognizing fallacies is essential for PHILOSOPHY ITSELF—the philosopher must be able to detect sophistical traps to pursue genuine inquiry into truth.

• The ability to identify fallacies separates genuine dialecticians from sophists and protects philosophical discourse from corruption.
