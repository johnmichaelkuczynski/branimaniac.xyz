ARISTOTLE: NICOMACHEAN ETHICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE HIGHEST GOOD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Every action and pursuit aims at some GOOD—the good is that at which all things aim.

• The highest human good is EUDAIMONIA (happiness, flourishing)—it is complete, self-sufficient, and chosen for its own sake.

• Eudaimonia is not pleasure, honor, or wealth—it is ACTIVITY OF THE SOUL IN ACCORDANCE WITH VIRTUE, and if there are multiple virtues, in accordance with the best and most complete.

• The FUNCTION (ergon) OF A HUMAN BEING is rational activity—just as a good harpist plays the harp well, a good human lives and acts according to reason well.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VIRTUE (ARETE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• VIRTUE (aretē) IS A HEXIS (stable disposition)—not a mere feeling or capacity, but a settled state of character acquired through habituation.

• MORAL VIRTUE IS A MEAN BETWEEN TWO VICES—one of excess, one of deficiency; courage lies between recklessness and cowardice.

• The mean is RELATIVE TO US, not arithmetic—what counts as temperate eating differs for an athlete and an invalid.

• VIRTUOUS ACTION REQUIRES CHOICE (prohairesis)—one must know what one is doing, choose it for its own sake, and act from a firm disposition.

• We are RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR CHARACTERS—though habit shapes us, we are the co-authors of our dispositions through our voluntary actions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRACTICAL WISDOM AND THE MORAL VIRTUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PRACTICAL WISDOM (phronesis) is the intellectual virtue that enables correct deliberation about what conduces to the good life—it is inseparable from moral virtue.

• The moral virtues include COURAGE, TEMPERANCE, LIBERALITY, MAGNIFICENCE, MAGNANIMITY, PROPER AMBITION, GOOD TEMPER, FRIENDLINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, WIT, AND JUSTICE.

• JUSTICE is the complete virtue in relation to others—it has both a general sense (lawfulness) and a specific sense (fairness in distribution and rectification).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AKRASIA AND PLEASURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• AKRASIA (weakness of will) IS POSSIBLE—one can know the good yet fail to act on it, overcome by passion; this is neither full virtue nor full vice.

• PLEASURE ACCOMPANIES UNIMPEDED VIRTUOUS ACTIVITY—it is not the good itself, but a natural concomitant that completes good activity like bloom on youth.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FRIENDSHIP (PHILIA)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• FRIENDSHIP (philia) IS ESSENTIAL TO THE GOOD LIFE—humans are social beings, and no one would choose to live without friends even with all other goods.

• There are three kinds of friendship: for UTILITY, PLEASURE, AND VIRTUE—only the last is complete and enduring, based on mutual recognition of good character.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXTERNAL GOODS AND CONTEMPLATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The happy person needs EXTERNAL GOODS—a measure of health, wealth, friends, and good fortune; virtue alone does not suffice for full flourishing.

• CONTEMPLATION (theōria) IS THE HIGHEST HUMAN ACTIVITY—it is most continuous, self-sufficient, loved for its own sake, and exercises our most divine element.

• The CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE IS HAPPIEST—it most fully realizes the divine element in us; the life of moral virtue is happy in a secondary way.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ETHICS AND POLITICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Ethics is a branch of POLITICAL SCIENCE—individual flourishing requires the right social conditions; the lawgiver must understand virtue to cultivate it in citizens.
