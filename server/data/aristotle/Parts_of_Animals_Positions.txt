ARISTOTLE: PARTS OF ANIMALS (DE PARTIBUS ANIMALIUM)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CAUSAL EXPLANATION IN BIOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• This work provides CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS for the anatomical features cataloged in the History of Animals—it asks why animals have the parts they do.

• FINAL CAUSATION IS PRIMARY in biological explanation—parts exist for the sake of their functions; nature does nothing in vain.

• The biologist must study FORM MORE THAN MATTER—the defining features of an animal are its functional organization, not its material constituents.

• NECESSITY IN BIOLOGY IS CONDITIONAL (hypothetical), not absolute—given that an animal is to perform a certain function, certain material conditions are necessary.

• One should not disdain the study of LOWLY CREATURES—every natural kind exhibits order and beauty to those who investigate its causes.

• Throughout, Aristotle insists on the METHODOLOGICAL PRIORITY OF FUNCTION OVER STRUCTURE—we understand what a part is by understanding what it is for.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PARTS FOR SURVIVAL VS. FLOURISHING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Parts exist either for the sake of SURVIVAL (to zen) or for the sake of LIVING WELL (to eu zen)—some organs are indispensable, others serve flourishing.

• Parts that are NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL (nutritive, sensory, locomotive) are found universally; parts for well-being vary more across species.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
UNIFORM AND NON-UNIFORM PARTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• UNIFORM PARTS (flesh, bone, blood) are composed of the four elements and serve as matter for non-uniform parts.

• NON-UNIFORM PARTS (organs, limbs) are composed of uniform parts and perform the characteristic functions of the animal.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE VITAL ORGANS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• BLOOD is the final form of nutriment and the material from which all other parts are constituted—it is the fundamental vital fluid.

• The HEART is the central organ of the body—the seat of vital heat, the source of blood, and the origin of the vascular system.

• The BRAIN exists to cool the blood and counterbalance the heart's heat—Aristotle denies it is the seat of sensation or intelligence.

• LUNGS provide cooling through respiration; animals without lungs use gills or other structures for the same purpose.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONSTITUTION AND TEMPERAMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Animals with more blood and hotter constitutions are generally MORE ACTIVE, INTELLIGENT, AND COURAGEOUS—temperament correlates with physiology.

• Nature provides DEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE PARTS according to each animal's way of life—horns, tusks, claws, hooves serve protection and predation.

• When nature allocates material to one part, it ECONOMIZES ELSEWHERE—no animal has both horns and tusks; resources are finite.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HUMAN UNIQUENESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The RIGHT SIDE of the body is naturally stronger and more honorable than the left—humans exhibit this most fully by standing upright.

• HUMANS ARE THE MOST UPRIGHT of animals because their nature is most divine—they alone have their upper parts oriented toward the upper cosmos.

• Humans have HANDS BECAUSE THEY ARE RATIONAL—not rational because they have hands; the hand is the tool of tools, suited to the versatile intelligence.
