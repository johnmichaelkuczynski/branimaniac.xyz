ARISTOTLE: PHYSICS (COMPLETE TREATISE)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NATURE AND NATURAL SCIENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• NATURE (physis) is an internal principle of motion and rest—natural things have within themselves the source of their own change.

• PHYSICS STUDIES NATURAL BEINGS—things that exist by nature as opposed to things that exist by art (techne) or chance.

• The physicist must know all FOUR CAUSES: material, formal, efficient, and final—nature is a cause in multiple senses.

• TELEOLOGY IS ESSENTIAL TO NATURAL EXPLANATION—nature acts for the sake of ends; final causation is not reducible to mechanism.

• CHANCE AND SPONTANEITY are real but derivative—they are incidental causes that presuppose the regular, goal-directed order of nature.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE THREE PRINCIPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The principles of natural things are FORM, PRIVATION, AND MATTER—change requires a persisting substrate and a transition between opposites.

• MATTER (hyle) is pure potentiality; FORM (eidos) is actuality—every natural substance is a composite of the two.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MOTION (KINESIS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• MOTION is the actuality of what exists potentially, insofar as it is potential—the progressive actualization of a capacity.

• There are four kinds of motion: LOCOMOTION, ALTERATION, GROWTH/DIMINUTION, and (in a qualified sense) GENERATION/CORRUPTION.

• Motion presupposes the INFINITE, PLACE, VOID, AND TIME—each must be analyzed to understand change.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE INFINITE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The INFINITE exists only potentially, never actually—there is no actually infinite body or magnitude, only indefinite divisibility or addition.

• This distinction between potential and actual infinity is key to resolving paradoxes of the infinite.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PLACE (TOPOS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PLACE is the innermost motionless boundary of the containing body—it is where a thing is, distinct from the thing itself.

• Place is neither matter nor form, but the limit of the surrounding body at which it touches the surrounded body.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE VOID
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• VOID (kenon) DOES NOT EXIST—motion does not require empty space.

• In fact, void would make motion impossible: there would be no natural direction, no medium for speed differentiation. In a void, all things would move at equal speed or not at all.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TIME
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• TIME is the number of motion with respect to before and after—it is dependent on change and on a soul that counts.

• The NOW is to time as the moving body is to motion—a continuity-maker that is always different yet connects past and future.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTINUITY AND ZENO'S PARADOXES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• CONTINUITY characterizes magnitude, motion, and time—they are infinitely divisible and contain no indivisible atomic units.

• ZENO'S PARADOXES are resolved by distinguishing actual from potential infinity—a finite magnitude contains infinitely many potential but not actual parts.

• The arrow is not at rest at each instant; motion cannot be composed of instants, just as a line cannot be composed of points.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MOVERS AND THE UNMOVED MOVER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Every motion requires a MOVER—nothing moves itself in the primary sense; there must be an agent of change distinct from the patient.

• There cannot be an INFINITE REGRESS OF MOVERS—there must be a FIRST UNMOVED MOVER that initiates motion without itself being moved.

• The UNMOVED MOVER is eternal, without magnitude, and located at the periphery of the cosmos—it causes the eternal circular motion of the heavens, which in turn causes all sublunary change.
