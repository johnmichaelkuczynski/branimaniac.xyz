ARISTOTLE: EUDEMIAN ETHICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The Eudemian Ethics is an INDEPENDENT ETHICAL TREATISE, not merely a draft of the Nicomachean—it has its own distinctive emphases and arguments.

• The NOBLE (to kalon) plays a more prominent role here than in the Nicomachean Ethics—virtuous action aims at the noble as its proper end.

• The Eudemian Ethics concludes with CONTEMPLATION OF GOD as the proper standard—the best life is ordered toward the service and contemplation of the divine.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EUDAIMONIA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• EUDAIMONIA IS THE HIGHEST GOOD—it is the end for the sake of which everything else is done, and it consists in living well and acting well.

• Eudaimonia requires specifying WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS BEST—the life of virtue, the life of practical wisdom, or the life of contemplation.

• The THREE LIVES traditionally proposed as best are the political, philosophical, and pleasure-seeking—only the first two are serious candidates.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GOODS AND FORTUNE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• GOODS ARE OF THREE KINDS: external goods, goods of the soul, and goods of the body—goods of the soul (virtues) are most authoritative.

• GOOD FORTUNE (eutuchia) differs from happiness—it provides external conditions but is not itself the good we achieve through our own activity.

• Some people seem NATURALLY FORTUNATE—Aristotle puzzles over whether this is divine favor, natural temperament, or mere chance.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CHOICE AND DELIBERATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• DELIBERATION CONCERNS MEANS, NOT ENDS—we wish for ends and deliberate about how to achieve them; choice is deliberate desire for what is in our power.

• PROHAIRESIS (choice) IS CENTRAL TO MORAL RESPONSIBILITY—actions are voluntary when they proceed from choice based on deliberation.

• VIRTUE IS A MEAN relative to us, lying between excess and deficiency—this doctrine appears in both treatises but with different emphases.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VIRTUES AND PRACTICAL WISDOM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The PARTICULAR VIRTUES are analyzed similarly to the Nicomachean treatment—courage, temperance, gentleness, liberality, and others as means between extremes.

• JUSTICE is both a complete virtue (general justice) and a specific virtue concerning fair shares and rectification.

• FRIENDSHIP (philia) is extensively analyzed—its species, its relation to self-love, its necessity for the good life.

• The person of PRACTICAL WISDOM (phronimos) is the standard of right action—what the wise person would judge to be the mean defines virtue.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
KALOKAGATHIA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• KALOKAGATHIA (nobility-and-goodness) is the comprehensive virtue—the unity of all particular virtues in a harmonious, noble character.

• The KALOKAGATHIC PERSON possesses all virtues and uses external goods rightly—wealth, beauty, and honor are pursued for the sake of noble action.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THEOLOGICAL FRAMING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Whatever promotes CONTEMPLATION OF GOD is best; whatever hinders it is bad—this theological framing of the human good is more explicit here than in the Nicomachean Ethics.

• Three books of the Eudemian Ethics are SHARED WITH THE NICOMACHEAN (on justice, intellectual virtues, and friendship)—scholars dispute which treatise they originally belonged to.
