ARISTOTLE: PRIOR ANALYTICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE DEFINITION OF SYLLOGISM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• A SYLLOGISM is a discourse in which, certain things being stated, something other than what is stated follows of necessity from their being so.

• Every syllogism consists of exactly THREE TERMS: major, minor, and middle.

• Every syllogism consists of exactly TWO PREMISES and ONE CONCLUSION.

• The MIDDLE TERM appears in both premises but not in the conclusion; it is the cause of the conclusion's necessity. Finding the middle term is the key to logical inference.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE THREE SYLLOGISTIC FIGURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are exactly THREE SYLLOGISTIC FIGURES, distinguished by the position of the middle term in the premises.

• FIRST FIGURE: Middle is subject in one premise, predicate in the other—produces the most perfect and self-evident syllogisms.

• SECOND FIGURE: Middle is predicate in both premises—suited for negative conclusions.

• THIRD FIGURE: Middle is subject in both premises—suited for particular conclusions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROPOSITIONAL FORMS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Premises and conclusions are either UNIVERSAL OR PARTICULAR, and either AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE, yielding four propositional forms:
  - A: Universal affirmative ("All S are P")
  - E: Universal negative ("No S are P")
  - I: Particular affirmative ("Some S are P")
  - O: Particular negative ("Some S are not P")

• Only certain COMBINATIONS OF PREMISE-PAIRS yield valid conclusions; Aristotle systematically identifies which moods are valid in each figure.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PERFECT AND IMPERFECT SYLLOGISMS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• FIRST-FIGURE MOODS (Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio) are perfect—their validity is self-evident and requires no proof.

• IMPERFECT SYLLOGISMS (in second and third figures) can be PERFECTED by reduction to first-figure moods.

• CONVERSION is a key method of reduction: E-propositions and I-propositions convert simply; A-propositions convert only to I-propositions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROOF METHODS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• REDUCTIO AD IMPOSSIBILE is another method for proving validity: assume the contradictory of the desired conclusion and derive a contradiction.

• EKTHESIS (exposition/setting out) is a third proof method involving selection of an individual instance.

• Some premise combinations yield NO VALID CONCLUSION AT ALL—Aristotle proves invalidity by counterexample.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MODAL SYLLOGISTIC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• MODAL SYLLOGISTIC extends the theory to premises involving necessity, possibility, and contingency.

• MIXED MODAL SYLLOGISMS (one necessary premise, one assertoric) can yield necessary conclusions under certain conditions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TERM LOGIC VS. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The logic is fundamentally TERM LOGIC, not propositional logic—it concerns relations among terms via predication, not truth-functional connectives.

• The syllogistic provides the FORMAL STRUCTURE FOR SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION, though demonstration proper requires additional conditions treated in the Posterior Analytics.
