ARISTOTLE: POLITICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MAN AS POLITICAL ANIMAL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• MAN IS BY NATURE A POLITICAL ANIMAL (zoon politikon)—the impulse toward political community is innate; one who lives outside the polis is either a beast or a god.

• The POLIS IS PRIOR TO THE INDIVIDUAL in the order of nature—just as the whole is prior to the part, the city is the condition for individual human flourishing.

• The polis arises from VILLAGES, WHICH ARISE FROM HOUSEHOLDS—the progression is from basic reproductive and economic units to the self-sufficient community aimed at the good life.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE HOUSEHOLD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The household includes three relations: MASTER-SLAVE, HUSBAND-WIFE, PARENT-CHILD—each has its own proper form of rule.

• SLAVERY IS NATURAL for those who lack the deliberative capacity for self-governance—they benefit from direction by natural masters. (Aristotle's most criticized doctrine.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE PURPOSE OF THE POLIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The PURPOSE OF THE POLIS IS NOT MERE LIFE BUT THE GOOD LIFE—security and commerce are necessary conditions, but virtue and nobility are the true ends.

• CITIZENSHIP in the strict sense is defined by participation in deliberative and judicial functions—the citizen shares in ruling and being ruled.

• The polis exists ultimately for the sake of NOBLE ACTION AND LEISURE (scholē)—war is for peace, business for leisure, and leisure for philosophy and virtuous activity.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CLASSIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Constitutions are classified by NUMBER OF RULERS (one, few, many) and by WHETHER THEY RULE FOR THE COMMON GOOD OR PRIVATE INTEREST.

• CORRECT CONSTITUTIONS: kingship (one for common good), aristocracy (few for common good), polity (many for common good).

• DEVIANT CONSTITUTIONS: tyranny (one for private interest), oligarchy (few for private interest), democracy (many for private interest).

• POLITY (politeia) is a MIXED CONSTITUTION blending oligarchic and democratic elements—it empowers the middling citizens and is often the most stable.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STABILITY AND FACTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The MIDDLE CLASS IS CRUCIAL FOR POLITICAL STABILITY—extremes of wealth and poverty breed faction; a large middle moderates conflict.

• FACTION (stasis) arises from disputes over justice—oligarchs think justice means inequality based on wealth; democrats think it means equality for all free citizens.

• REVOLUTION occurs when the balance of power no longer matches the constitutional form—each regime carries the seeds of its own destruction.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE BEST CONSTITUTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The BEST CONSTITUTION ABSOLUTELY would require ideal conditions—virtuous citizens, adequate resources, proper size; it aims at contemplative happiness.

• The BEST PRACTICABLE CONSTITUTION must suit the character and circumstances of the actual population—the statesman adapts to available human material.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EDUCATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• EDUCATION IS THE STATESMAN'S MOST IMPORTANT TASK—citizens must be trained in virtue appropriate to the constitution; character shapes regime stability.

• Education should be COMMON AND PUBLIC, not private—since the end of the city is one, the training of citizens must be unified.

• The curriculum includes LETTERS, GYMNASTICS, MUSIC, AND DRAWING—music is especially important for shaping character and enabling noble leisure.
