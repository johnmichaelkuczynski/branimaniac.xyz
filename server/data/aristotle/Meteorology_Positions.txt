ARISTOTLE: METEOROLOGY
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCOPE AND METHOD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• METEOROLOGY STUDIES PHENOMENA IN THE REGION BETWEEN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH—occurrences in the upper atmosphere and related terrestrial phenomena.

• The region below the moon is filled with exhalations continuously drawn up by the sun's heat.

• The HEAT OF THE SUN is the primary efficient cause of meteorological phenomena—it drives the evaporative cycle.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE TWO EXHALATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• These phenomena are caused by TWO EXHALATIONS rising from the earth: one hot and dry (smoky/vaporous), the other wet and cold (moist/steamy).

• The DRY EXHALATION is responsible for winds, thunder, lightning, and various fiery phenomena in the upper atmosphere.

• The MOIST EXHALATION is responsible for clouds, rain, dew, frost, snow, and hail.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CELESTIAL-LOOKING PHENOMENA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• COMETS AND THE MILKY WAY are not celestial phenomena but atmospheric—they are ignitions of the dry exhalation in the upper air.

• SHOOTING STARS AND METEORS are likewise combustions of dry exhalation, not objects falling from the heavens.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WINDS, THUNDER, AND LIGHTNING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• WINDS are horizontal movements of the dry exhalation; their direction and character depend on geographical and seasonal factors.

• THUNDER is the sound produced when dry exhalation trapped in clouds is violently expelled; LIGHTNING is its ignition.

• Lightning is perceived before thunder because SIGHT IS FASTER THAN HEARING—both occur simultaneously but are perceived successively.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRECIPITATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• RAIN forms when moist exhalation rises, cools, condenses into clouds, and the droplets coalesce until heavy enough to fall.

• SNOW is frozen cloud; FROST is frozen dew; HAIL forms when rain freezes during rapid descent through cold air.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WATER CYCLE AND THE SEA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• RIVERS AND SPRINGS originate from condensation within the earth and from rainwater collected in subterranean reservoirs—not from inexhaustible underground seas.

• The SEA IS SALTY because the dry, earthy exhalation mixes with water; evaporation removes fresh water, leaving salt concentrated.

• The SEA'S LEVEL REMAINS CONSTANT because evaporation balances inflow—it neither increases indefinitely nor dries up.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EARTHQUAKES AND GEOLOGICAL CHANGE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• EARTHQUAKES are caused by dry exhalation trapped underground seeking release—the earth shakes as the pneuma bursts forth.

• GEOLOGICAL CHANGE occurs over vast time scales—seas become land, land becomes sea, but so slowly that it escapes historical memory.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OPTICAL PHENOMENA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• RAINBOWS, HALOS, AND MOCK SUNS are optical phenomena produced by reflection of light from moisture in the air under specific geometric conditions.

• The rainbow displays a FIXED ORDER OF COLORS and appears at a specific angle relative to sun and observer—Aristotle attempts a geometrical explanation of its arc and coloration.
