ARISTOTLE: MAGNA MORALIA (GREAT ETHICS)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AUTHORSHIP AND SCOPE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The Magna Moralia is DISPUTED IN AUTHORSHIP—some scholars consider it an early Aristotelian work, others a later summary by a student, but it contains recognizably Peripatetic doctrine.

• ETHICS IS A PART OF POLITICAL SCIENCE—the study of individual virtue serves the larger inquiry into how to organize the city for human flourishing.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE GOOD AND EUDAIMONIA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The GOOD IS THAT AT WHICH ALL THINGS AIM—but we seek not the universal Good (against Plato) but the practicable human good.

• EUDAIMONIA IS THE HIGHEST HUMAN GOOD—complete, self-sufficient, and consisting in the activity of virtue over a complete life.

• The happy person needs EXTERNAL GOODS AND GOOD FORTUNE—virtue is necessary but not sufficient; bodily and external goods matter.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE SOUL AND VIRTUE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The SOUL HAS RATIONAL AND NON-RATIONAL PARTS—virtue pertains to both: intellectual virtue to the rational, moral virtue to the non-rational part as it obeys reason.

• VIRTUE IS A MEAN BETWEEN EXTREMES—excess and deficiency are vices; the virtuous disposition hits the intermediate appropriate to the circumstances.

• The mean is determined by RIGHT REASON (orthos logos)—the standard is what the practically wise person would judge.

• MORAL VIRTUE ARISES THROUGH HABITUATION—we become courageous by performing courageous acts, temperate by exercising temperance.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VOLUNTARY ACTION AND CHOICE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• VOLUNTARY ACTION is action that originates in the agent with knowledge of particulars—compulsion and ignorance excuse.

• CHOICE (prohairesis) IS DELIBERATE DESIRE for things in our power—it follows deliberation and is essential to moral evaluation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE PARTICULAR VIRTUES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The PARTICULAR VIRTUES are enumerated and analyzed: courage, temperance, gentleness, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and others.

• JUSTICE is analyzed as both general virtue (lawfulness) and particular virtue (fairness in distributions and transactions).

• NATURAL JUSTICE exists alongside conventional justice—some things are just by nature, not merely by local enactment.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRACTICAL WISDOM AND AKRASIA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PRACTICAL WISDOM (phronesis) is the intellectual virtue that discerns the right means to good ends—it is inseparable from moral virtue.

• AKRASIA (incontinence) IS ACTING AGAINST ONE'S BETTER JUDGMENT due to passion—the incontinent person knows the good but fails to do it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PLEASURE, FRIENDSHIP, AND THE NOBLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PLEASURE accompanies virtuous activity but is not itself the good—it completes activity as a supervenient end.

• FRIENDSHIP IS NECESSARY FOR HAPPINESS—no one would choose a friendless life even with all other goods.

• SELF-LOVE RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD IS VIRTUOUS—the good person loves what is best in himself (reason) and acts accordingly.

• The ultimate standard is the NOBLE (to kalon)—the virtuous person chooses virtuous action because it is noble, not merely because it is pleasant or useful.
