ARISTOTLE: CATEGORIES
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ONTOLOGICAL FUNDAMENTALITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PRIMARY SUBSTANCES ARE ONTOLOGICALLY FUNDAMENTAL: Individual things—"this man," "this horse"—are the most basic entities. Everything else is either predicated of them or present in them.

• SECONDARY SUBSTANCES: Species and genera under which primary substances fall are less fundamental but still substantial. "Man" and "animal" are secondary substances.

• The "said of" relation (predication) is distinct from the "present in" relation (inherence). These are two different ways things relate to substances.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE TEN CATEGORIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are exactly ten categories (highest genera of being):
  1. SUBSTANCE - what a thing is
  2. QUANTITY - how much or how many
  3. QUALITY - what kind
  4. RELATION - relative to what
  5. PLACE - where
  6. TIME - when
  7. POSITION - in what posture
  8. STATE - having, equipped with what
  9. ACTION - doing what
  10. AFFECTION - undergoing what

• These are the highest genera under which all beings fall. Every predicate belongs to one of these categories.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROPERTIES OF SUBSTANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SUBSTANCE ADMITS NO CONTRARY: There is no opposite of "man" or "horse." Unlike qualities (hot/cold), substances have no contraries.

• SUBSTANCE DOES NOT ADMIT OF DEGREES: One man is not more a man than another. Substances don't come in degrees the way qualities do.

• SUBSTANCE CAN RECEIVE CONTRARIES: The same individual can become hot, then cold, while remaining numerically one. This is the distinctive mark of substance—it can receive contraries while persisting through change.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUANTITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• QUANTITY IS EITHER DISCRETE OR CONTINUOUS: Number is discrete; line, surface, body, time, and place are continuous.

• QUANTITY HAS NO CONTRARY AND DOES NOT ADMIT OF DEGREES: There is no opposite of "three feet long." One length is not more a length than another.

• PARTS OF SOME QUANTITIES HAVE POSITION RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER: Parts of a line have relative position; units of number do not.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RELATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• RELATIVES ARE DEFINED CORRELATIVELY: A master is master of a slave; double is double of a half. You cannot understand one correlative without reference to the other.

• SOME RELATIVES ARE SIMULTANEOUS BY NATURE: Knowing which correlative exists entails knowing the other exists. Master and slave come into being and cease to be together.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUALITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• QUALITY HAS FOUR SPECIES:
  1. States and dispositions (knowledge, virtue)
  2. Natural capacities (ability to run, resistance to disease)
  3. Affective qualities (sweetness, warmth, colors)
  4. Shape and figure (triangular, straight)

• QUALITY ADMITS BOTH CONTRARIES AND DEGREES: Something can be more or less white. Justice is contrary to injustice.

• THE SIMILAR AND DISSIMILAR ARE PREDICATED ONLY IN RESPECT OF QUALITY: We call things similar or dissimilar based on their qualitative features.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE FOUR TYPES OF OPPOSITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are four types of opposition:
  1. CONTRADICTORY - being/not being
  2. CONTRARY - black/white, good/bad
  3. PRIVATIVE - blindness/sight (possession/privation)
  4. RELATIVE - master/slave, double/half

• CONTRADICTORIES ADMIT NO INTERMEDIATE: One must be true of any subject. "Socrates is sitting" or "Socrates is not sitting"—no middle ground.

• SOME CONTRARIES ADMIT INTERMEDIATES, OTHERS DO NOT: Black and white admit grey; odd and even do not admit any intermediate.

• PRIVATION DIFFERS FROM NEGATION: Blindness is privation of sight in what naturally has sight, not mere absence. A stone is not "blind"—it never had sight to lose.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRIORITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PRIORITY HAS MULTIPLE SENSES:
  1. TEMPORAL - what came first in time
  2. EXISTENTIAL - what can exist without the other but not vice versa
  3. ORDER OF EXPOSITION - what is logically prior in demonstration
  4. VALUE - what is better or more honorable

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CHANGE AND MOTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• CHANGE/MOTION FALLS INTO SIX SPECIES:
  1. GENERATION - coming into being
  2. CORRUPTION - ceasing to be
  3. INCREASE - growth in quantity
  4. DIMINUTION - decrease in quantity
  5. ALTERATION - change in quality
  6. LOCOMOTION - change in place

• These exhaust the possible types of change. Any change falls under one of these six species.
