ARISTOTLE: POETICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
POETRY AS MIMESIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• POETRY IS MIMESIS (imitation/representation)—all poetic arts imitate human action, character, and emotion through different media, objects, and modes.

• The species of poetry differ by MEDIUM (rhythm, language, melody), OBJECT (better, worse, or similar characters), and MODE (narrative, dramatic, or mixed).

• MIMESIS IS NATURAL TO HUMANS—we are the most imitative of animals, we learn through imitation, and we take pleasure in representations even of painful things.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRAGEDY DEFINED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• TRAGEDY is the imitation of a serious, complete action of magnitude, in embellished language, through enacted drama, accomplishing CATHARSIS OF PITY AND FEAR.

• Tragedy has SIX ELEMENTS: plot (mythos), character (ēthos), thought (dianoia), diction (lexis), melody (melos), and spectacle (opsis)—ranked in that order of importance.

• PLOT IS THE SOUL OF TRAGEDY—it is the arrangement of incidents; tragedy is primarily imitation of action, not of persons.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
UNITY AND STRUCTURE OF PLOT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• A good plot must be WHOLE AND COMPLETE—having a beginning, middle, and end, with parts connected by necessity or probability.

• The plot must have PROPER MAGNITUDE—long enough to allow the change of fortune, short enough to be grasped as a unity.

• UNITY OF PLOT is not unity of hero—a plot is one when it imitates one complete action; EPISODIC PLOTS that lack necessary connection are inferior.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
POETRY VS. HISTORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• POETRY IS MORE PHILOSOPHICAL THAN HISTORY—history tells what happened, poetry what could happen; poetry expresses universals, history particulars.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REVERSAL AND RECOGNITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The best plots involve REVERSAL (peripeteia) AND RECOGNITION (anagnorisis)—the change from ignorance to knowledge, ideally coinciding with the reversal of fortune.

• The COMPLEX PLOT combining reversal and recognition is superior to the simple plot—it produces the characteristic tragic pleasure most effectively.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE TRAGIC HERO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The ideal tragic hero is NEITHER PERFECTLY VIRTUOUS NOR VILLAINOUS—a person of high standing who falls through some HAMARTIA (error/flaw), not vice.

• The change should be from GOOD FORTUNE TO BAD—plots ending in prosperity are less tragic; the downfall of the good-but-flawed evokes pity and fear.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PITY, FEAR, AND CATHARSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PITY is aroused by undeserved misfortune; FEAR by misfortune befalling someone like ourselves—together they produce catharsis.

• CATHARSIS is the clarification or purgation of pity and fear—tragedy's emotional effect is beneficial, not corrupting. (The term's precise meaning remains debated.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CHARACTER AND PLOT RESOLUTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• CHARACTER (ēthos) must be good, appropriate, like reality, and consistent—characters should act according to necessity or probability given who they are.

• The DÉNOUEMENT should arise from the plot itself—NOT FROM THE DEUS EX MACHINA; resolution must follow from prior action.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRAGEDY VS. EPIC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• EPIC shares many features with tragedy but differs in length, meter (hexameter), and narrative mode—it permits greater scale and multiple simultaneous actions.

• TRAGEDY IS SUPERIOR TO EPIC—it achieves its end in shorter compass, has greater unity, and adds the powerful resources of music and spectacle to poetic imitation.
