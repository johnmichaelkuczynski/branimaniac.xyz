ARISTOTLE: POSTERIOR ANALYTICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE (EPISTEME)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE (episteme) is knowledge of the cause and of the fact that it could not be otherwise—it is necessary, not contingent.

• All TEACHING AND LEARNING proceed from pre-existing knowledge, either of the fact that something is or of the meaning of terms.

• Scientific knowledge is acquired through DEMONSTRATION (apodeixis)—a syllogism that produces knowledge.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REQUIREMENTS FOR DEMONSTRATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• A demonstration must proceed from premises that are TRUE, PRIMARY, IMMEDIATE, BETTER KNOWN THAN, PRIOR TO, AND CAUSALLY EXPLANATORY OF the conclusion.

• Demonstrative premises must be NECESSARY—one cannot have scientific knowledge of what could be otherwise.

• Demonstration reveals the "REASONED FACT" (to dioti), not merely the "BARE FACT" (to hoti)—it shows WHY, not just THAT.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE REGRESS PROBLEM AND FOUNDATIONALISM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There is a REGRESS PROBLEM: If every premise requires demonstration, we face infinite regress, circularity, or foundationalism.

• Aristotle's solution is FOUNDATIONALISM: Demonstration rests on FIRST PRINCIPLES (archai) that are known but not themselves demonstrated.

• First principles are grasped by NOUS (intellectual intuition), not by demonstration—nous is more certain than scientific knowledge.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FIRST PRINCIPLES (ARCHAI)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• First principles include AXIOMS (common to all sciences), DEFINITIONS, and HYPOTHESES (existence assumptions).

• Each science has its own PROPER PRINCIPLES concerning its proper genus; one cannot demonstrate across genera (no "metabasis").

• DEFINITIONS state the essence (to ti ēn einai)—the "what it was to be" that thing.

• A proper definition is reached through DIVISION of genus by differentiae until the infima species is isolated.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MIDDLE TERM AS CAUSE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The MIDDLE TERM in a demonstration expresses the cause; finding the middle term is finding the explanation.

• There are FOUR TYPES OF CAUSE (material, formal, efficient, final), and different demonstrations exhibit different causal relations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PER SE PREDICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PER SE (kath' hauto) PREDICATION differs from accidental predication; science concerns only per se attributes of its subject genus.

• Scientific demonstration concerns what holds UNIVERSALLY AND ALWAYS, or at least FOR THE MOST PART—not the exceptional or coincidental.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NOMINAL VS. REAL DEFINITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• NOMINAL DEFINITIONS (what a term signifies) differ from REAL DEFINITIONS (what the essence of the thing is).

• The EXISTENCE of a thing must be established before its essence can be demonstrated; you cannot define what does not exist.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE STRUCTURE OF SCIENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The STRUCTURE OF A SCIENCE is thus:
  1. Establish the existence of basic subjects
  2. Grasp definitions and axioms through nous
  3. Demonstrate per se attributes of those subjects through their causes

• This foundational structure grounds all scientific knowledge in necessary, causal explanations derived from self-evident first principles.
