ARISTOTLE: GENERATION OF ANIMALS (DE GENERATIONE ANIMALIUM)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CAUSAL EXPLANATION OF REPRODUCTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• This work explains the EFFICIENT AND FORMAL CAUSES OF ANIMAL REPRODUCTION—how new organisms come to be and acquire their specific forms.

• SEXUAL REPRODUCTION involves the union of male and female contributions, which differ in kind rather than merely in degree.

• The entire process exhibits TELEOLOGICAL ORDER—generation exists for the sake of perpetuating the species, the closest approximation to eternity available to mortal beings.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MALE AND FEMALE CONTRIBUTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The MALE CONTRIBUTES FORM (the efficient and formal cause) through semen; the FEMALE CONTRIBUTES MATTER (the material cause) through menstrual fluid or its analogue.

• SEMEN DOES NOT BECOME PART OF THE EMBRYO—it acts like a craftsman on material, imparting motion and form without contributing substance.

• The formative power of semen is carried by PNEUMA (vital breath)—a substance analogous to aether that transmits soul-capacities.

• The female provides CATAMENIA (menstrual blood) as the matter to be shaped—it is concocted blood not yet fully refined into bodily parts.

• CONCEPTION occurs when male semen acts on female matter, setting it and imparting the movements that will produce the embryo's parts.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The HEART FORMS FIRST in the embryo—it is the principle of life and the source from which other organs develop.

• Development proceeds by EPIGENESIS, NOT PREFORMATION—parts are generated successively, not simply enlarged from a pre-existing miniature.

• The embryo acquires souls SUCCESSIVELY: first nutritive, then sensitive, finally (in humans) rational—each presupposes its predecessor.

• The RATIONAL SOUL ENTERS FROM OUTSIDE (thyrathen)—unlike nutritive and sensitive soul, nous has no bodily organ and cannot arise from material processes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HEREDITY AND SEX DETERMINATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• HEREDITY is explained by the relative strength of male and female formative movements—offspring resemble whichever parent's motions dominate in each respect.

• SEX DETERMINATION depends on the heat and concoction of the semen—hotter, more concocted semen produces males; cooler produces females.

• FEMALES ARE DEFORMED MALES in a limited sense—the female results when the male formative principle fails to fully master the material.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ANOMALIES AND VARIATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SPONTANEOUS GENERATION occurs in some lower organisms when environmental heat acts on suitable matter without sexual union—nature still provides form.

• MONSTROSITIES (terata) arise when formative movements go astray—nature's failures reveal what she normally accomplishes.

• INFERTILITY between species results from incompatibility of formative movements and material—hybrids like mules are typically sterile.

• Different animals have different GESTATION PERIODS AND DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUENCES—these correlate with the perfection and heat of their natures.

• TWINS AND MULTIPLE BIRTHS occur when the matter is sufficient for more than one individual and the formative movements divide accordingly.
