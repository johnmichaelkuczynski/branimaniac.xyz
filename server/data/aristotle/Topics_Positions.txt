ARISTOTLE: TOPICS
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DIALECTICAL REASONING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The TOPICS concerns dialectical reasoning—syllogisms from reputable opinions (endoxa), not from necessary truths as in demonstration.

• DIALECTIC is useful for three things: training, conversation with the many, and philosophical sciences (by revealing aporiai and first principles).

• A DIALECTICAL PROPOSITION is one that seems true to all, to most, or to the wise (and among the wise, to all, most, or the most notable).

• A PROBLEM is a thesis about which people either hold no opinion, or the many disagree with the wise, or there is disagreement within either group.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE FOUR PREDICABLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Every dialectical proposition and problem concerns one of FOUR PREDICABLES: definition, genus, proprium (unique property), or accident.

• A DEFINITION states the essence and is convertible with its subject—it applies to all and only instances of the definiendum.

• A GENUS is predicated essentially of many things differing in species—it says what the subject is but not uniquely.

• A PROPRIUM is not the essence but belongs to only that species and is convertible with it (e.g., capable of learning grammar / man).

• An ACCIDENT is what may belong or not belong to the same subject—it is neither definition, genus, nor proprium.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TOPOI (COMMONPLACES)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The dialectician must collect TOPOI (commonplaces)—general argumentative strategies applicable across subject matters.

• Topoi are organized according to which predicable is at issue: there are topoi for attacking or establishing definitions, genera, propria, and accidents.

• TOPOI FOR DEFINITION include: checking if the definition fails to be convertible, if it is obscure, if it uses metaphor, if it is circular, if it fails to state the genus.

• TOPOI FOR GENUS include: checking if the proposed genus is not predicated in the "what is it" category, if something participates in the genus but not the species.

• TOPOI FOR PROPRIUM include: checking if the property fails to hold of all instances, if it is not convertible, if it holds only sometimes.

• TOPOI FOR ACCIDENT include: examining opposites, correlatives, coordinates, and inflections to find inconsistencies.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INDUCTION VS. SYLLOGISM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• INDUCTION is the progression from particulars to universals and is more persuasive to the many.

• SYLLOGISM moves from universals and is more compelling to dialecticians.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DIALECTICAL PRACTICE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The QUESTIONER'S GOAL is to extract concessions that yield a contradictory conclusion to the answerer's thesis; the ANSWERER'S GOAL is to avoid contradiction.

• One should distinguish MULTIPLE SENSES OF A TERM (homonymy) before proceeding—ambiguity is a source of fallacious refutation.

• DIALECTICAL PRACTICE requires knowing not just the topoi but when and how to deploy them—order, timing, and concealment matter.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DIALECTIC AND FIRST PHILOSOPHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Dialectic is PROPAEDEUTIC TO FIRST PHILOSOPHY: By thoroughly examining aporiai from all sides, dialectic clears the path toward grasping the first principles that nous ultimately apprehends.

• Dialectic does not itself demonstrate first principles but prepares the mind to grasp them through nous.
