ARISTOTLE: RHETORIC
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE NATURE OF RHETORIC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• RHETORIC IS THE COUNTERPART (antistrophos) OF DIALECTIC—both deal with matters that are common knowledge and belong to no specific science; both argue on opposite sides.

• Rhetoric is the faculty of DISCOVERING THE AVAILABLE MEANS OF PERSUASION in any given case—it is an art (technē), not mere knack or natural talent.

• Rhetoric is USEFUL because truth and justice are naturally stronger, but audiences are imperfect; the skilled speaker helps truth prevail.

• The rhetorician must be able to ARGUE BOTH SIDES—not to practice injustice, but to understand the arguments and refute sophistical opponents.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THREE MODES OF PERSUASION (PISTEIS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are THREE MODES OF PERSUASION (pisteis): ETHOS (character of the speaker), PATHOS (emotional state of the audience), and LOGOS (the argument itself).

• ETHOS persuades when the speech makes the speaker appear credible—this must be achieved through the speech itself, not prior reputation.

• PATHOS persuades by putting the audience into a certain emotional state—emotions alter judgment, so the rhetorician must understand psychology.

• LOGOS persuades through demonstration or apparent demonstration—rhetorical arguments take the form of enthymemes and examples.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENTHYMEME AND EXAMPLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The ENTHYMEME IS THE RHETORICAL SYLLOGISM—it proceeds from probable premises or signs rather than necessary truths, and often leaves premises unstated.

• The EXAMPLE (paradeigma) IS RHETORICAL INDUCTION—it argues from particular to particular, using historical or invented parallels.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THREE SPECIES OF RHETORIC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are THREE SPECIES OF RHETORIC: deliberative (political), forensic (judicial), and epideictic (ceremonial praise and blame).

• DELIBERATIVE RHETORIC concerns future action—its end is the expedient or harmful; the speaker advises or dissuades the assembly.

• FORENSIC RHETORIC concerns past action—its end is the just or unjust; the speaker accuses or defends before a jury.

• EPIDEICTIC RHETORIC concerns present character—its end is the noble or shameful; the speaker praises or blames before spectators.

• Each species has its own TOPICS (topoi)—commonplaces and lines of argument suited to its characteristic subject matter.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EMOTIONS AND CHARACTER TYPES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Book II analyzes the EMOTIONS in detail—anger, calm, friendship, enmity, fear, confidence, shame, pity, indignation, envy, emulation—showing their causes and how to arouse or allay them.

• Book II also treats CHARACTER TYPES—youth, old age, prime of life, nobility, wealth, power—since speakers must adapt to their audiences.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STYLE AND ARRANGEMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• STYLE (lexis) matters because the manner of expression affects persuasion—CLARITY is the chief virtue, with appropriateness to subject and audience.

• METAPHOR is the most important stylistic device—it produces clarity, pleasure, and vividness; facility with metaphor indicates natural genius.

• ARRANGEMENT (taxis) of a speech has essential parts—at minimum a statement of the case and the proof; the elaborated structure includes proem, narration, proof, and epilogue.
