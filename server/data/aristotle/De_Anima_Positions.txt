ARISTOTLE: ON THE SOUL (DE ANIMA)
Twenty Core Positions

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOUL AS FORM OF THE BODY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• SOUL (psyche) is the form of a natural body having life potentially—it is the first actuality of an organized living body.

• Soul and body are NOT TWO SEPARATE SUBSTANCES but related as form to matter—the soul is the actuality of which the body is the potentiality.

• Asking whether soul and body are one is therefore LIKE ASKING WHETHER THE WAX AND ITS SHAPE ARE ONE—the question dissolves once hylomorphism is understood.

• SOUL IS NOT ITSELF A BODY but cannot exist apart from a body (with one possible exception)—it is not independently subsistent.

• The soul is ultimately defined by its CHARACTERISTIC ACTIVITIES, not its material substrate—to understand what soul is, study what living things distinctively do.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE THREE GRADES OF SOUL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• There are THREE GRADES OF SOUL: nutritive (plants), sensitive (animals), and rational (humans)—each higher grade presupposes the lower.

• The NUTRITIVE SOUL is the most basic principle of life, responsible for nutrition, growth, and reproduction.

• The SENSITIVE SOUL adds perception, desire, and locomotion—these capacities require bodily organs.

• The RATIONAL SOUL adds the capacity for thought (nous)—grasping universals, engaging in reasoning, contemplating truth.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PERCEPTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• PERCEPTION IS THE RECEPTION OF SENSIBLE FORM WITHOUT THE MATTER—the eye receives the form of redness without receiving red paint.

• Each sense has its PROPER OBJECT (color for sight, sound for hearing); error concerning proper objects is minimal.

• There are also COMMON SENSIBLES (motion, rest, number, shape, magnitude) perceived by multiple senses, and INCIDENTAL SENSIBLES perceived through association.

• The COMMON SENSE (koinē aisthēsis) integrates deliverances of the five senses and enables awareness of perceiving.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IMAGINATION (PHANTASIA)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• IMAGINATION (phantasia) is distinct from both perception and thought—it is a movement resulting from actual perception that enables images to persist in the soul.

• Phantasia provides the images that thought operates upon and enables memory and dreams.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INTELLECT (NOUS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• THINKING DIFFERS FROM PERCEIVING: perception requires bodily organs and is of particulars; thought requires no organ and grasps universals.

• The intellect is POTENTIALLY ALL INTELLIGIBLES—it becomes what it thinks by receiving intelligible forms.

• Aristotle distinguishes AGENT INTELLECT AND PATIENT INTELLECT—one is like light that makes colors visible; the other is like a tablet on which nothing is written.

• The AGENT INTELLECT IS SEPARABLE, IMPASSIBLE, UNMIXED, AND ETERNAL—this notoriously obscure passage has generated centuries of controversy.

• The object of thought in act IS IDENTICAL WITH THE THINKING INTELLECT—in thinking a form, the intellect becomes that form.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DESIRE AND LOCOMOTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• DESIRE (orexis) is the source of animal locomotion—movement requires both a cognitive apprehension of a goal and an appetitive striving toward it.

• The practical syllogism: a universal premise (the good to be pursued) + a particular premise (this is such a good) = action.
