NEWTON POSITION STATEMENT 

Here is a series of 100 positions in the spirit of Isaac Newton, reflecting his revolutionary ideas, his philosophical stance, and the core of the *Principia* and the *Opticks*.

1. The universe is a comprehensible machine governed by mathematical laws.
2. The task of natural philosophy is to deduce these laws from the phenomena of motion.
3. I do not frame hypotheses (*Hypotheses non fingo*)—I derive explanations from evidence.
4. The center of the universe is not a place, but the common center of gravity of all bodies, determined by the laws of motion and gravity.
5. Absolute, true, and mathematical time flows uniformly without relation to anything external.
6. Absolute, true, and mathematical space remains similar and immovable without relation to anything external.
7. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place to another.
8. The natural state of a body is not rest, but to persist in its state of motion or rest unless compelled to change by an impressed force.
9. Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.
10. The change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which that force is impressed.
11. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.
12. There is a force of gravity that extends to all bodies in the solar system and to the universe beyond.
13. Gravity is proportional to the quantity of matter in each body.
14. Gravity decreases as the square of the distance between the centers of two bodies increases.
15. The same force that causes an apple to fall on Earth holds the Moon in its orbit.
16. The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, a consequence of an inverse-square law force.
17. Comets are celestial objects governed by the same laws as planets and can return on predictable paths.
18. The tides are caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and the Sun upon the Earth's seas.
19. The Earth is not a perfect sphere but is flattened at the poles due to its rotation.
20. The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge.
21. The motions of celestial bodies are not due to vortices of a subtle ether, but to a universal force acting through empty space.
22. Light is not a modification of a medium, but consists of corpuscles emitted from shining bodies.
23. White light is not pure and homogeneous, but is a mixture of all the colors of the spectrum.
24. Colors are not modifications of white light, but original and innate properties of rays of different refrangibility.
25. A ray of light can be "fitted" for easy reflection or easy transmission, explaining the phenomena of thin films.
26. The colored rings seen in thin plates (Newton's rings) provide a measurable periodicity to the behavior of light.
27. The sharpness of shadows proves that light rays travel in straight paths.
28. The reflection telescope I invented, using a mirror, avoids the chromatic aberration inherent in lenses.
29. The study of optics reveals the precise and mathematical nature of even the most subtle phenomena.
30. The laws of motion and gravity demonstrate that the frame of the system of the world is the same as the frame of common things.
31. The first cause of the solar system is intelligent design; the beautiful arrangement of the planets could not arise from chance.
32. This most elegant system of the Sun, planets, and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.
33. God is a powerful, eternal, infinite, and perfectly intelligent Being who constitutes duration and space.
34. God endures forever and is present everywhere, and by existing always and everywhere, He constitutes duration and space.
35. He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite; not duration or space, but He endures and is present.
36. We know Him only by His most wise and excellent contrivances of things and final causes.
37. A continual miracle is not needed to keep the planets in their orbits; the laws of motion and gravity suffice.
38. The ultimate reason for gravity is not a mechanical cause, but the direct will and means of the Creator.
39. The variety of motion in the universe is always decreasing, requiring an active principle to replenish it.
40. The fixed stars are at immense distances so as not to fall into one another by their mutual gravity.
41. The universe is possibly infinite in extent and contains many such systems as our own.
42. The resistance experienced by pendulums proves the existence of a subtle, elastic medium—the aether—though its role is not gravitational.
43. Alchemy is a worthy pursuit for investigating the active principles and intimate structures of matter.
44. The Book of Daniel and the Revelation of St. John are the keys to understanding the prophecies and the timeline of sacred history.
45. The study of nature and the study of scripture are two windows into the mind of God; they cannot truly contradict.
46. Absolute space is the sensorium of God—the medium through which He perceives and orders the universe.
47. Mathematical principles are not mere conveniences, but the true language in which the Creator wrote the world.
48. The quantity of matter (mass) is the measure of the same, arising from its density and bulk conjointly.
49. The quantity of motion (momentum) is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly.
50. The innate force of matter (*vis insita*) is the power of resisting by which every body perseveres in its state.
51. An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body to change its state.
52. The centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn, impelled, or tend toward a point as to a center.
53. The resistance of a medium is proportional to the density of that medium and the surface and velocity of the body moving through it.
54. The motion of bodies in resisting mediums can be calculated with precision.
55. The wave theory of light is insufficient to explain its rectilinear propagation and the sharpness of shadows.
56. The fits of easy reflection and easy transmission are a mathematical description of periodic behavior in light, not a hypothesis about its cause.
57. I do not concern myself with the ultimate cause of gravity; it is enough that it exists, acts according to my laws, and accounts for all celestial and terrestrial motions.
58. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
59. Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.
60. Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest friend is truth.
61. Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.
62. I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.
63. To myself I am only a child playing on the seashore, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.
64. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I leave to the consideration of my readers.
65. It is the perfection of God's works that they are all done with the greatest simplicity.
66. The wondrous uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice.
67. The best and safest method of philosophizing seems to be, first to inquire diligently into the properties of things, and establishing those properties by experiments, and then to proceed more slowly to hypotheses for their explanation.
68. Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind that it never had many professors.
69. This most beautiful system [of the world] could only proceed from the dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.
70. No great discovery was ever made without a bold guess.
71. Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.
72. Live your life as an exclamation rather than an explanation.
73. What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean.
74. The seeds of great discoveries are constantly floating around us, but they only take root in minds well prepared to receive them.
75. If others would think as hard as I did, they would get similar results.
76. My work in mathematics was done mostly to satisfy my own mind and to pass the time in my solitude.
77. The diamond is the most precious of stones, and yet more precious is knowledge.
78. The inverse-square law is written in the very fabric of the cosmos, evident in the spreading of light, sound, and force.
79. All the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea are deducible from the principle of gravity.
80. The same simplicity of principle that governs the fall of a stone governs the motions of the cosmos.
81. The business of natural philosophy is to argue from phenomena without feigning hypotheses, and to deduce causes from effects.
82. The laws of motion are the foundation upon which the entire structure of rational mechanics is built.
83. Matter is inert and passive; its motion arises solely from active principles and impressed forces.
84. The primary qualities of bodies—solidity, extension, figure, and mobility—are universal and mathematical.
85. Secondary qualities—colors, sounds, tastes—are but sensations in the perceiving mind, produced by the primary qualities of bodies.
86. The ultimate particles of matter are solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable, and endowed with inertia.
87. God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles.
88. It seems probable to me that God in the beginning formed matter in such a way that these particles could be neither broken nor worn out.
89. The changing of bodies into light, and light into bodies, is very conformable to the course of nature.
90. Nature is pleased with simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.
91. The unity and harmony of the cosmic design argue for a single, sovereign Creator.
92. The system of the world reveals a counsel and dominion that is intelligent and powerful.
93. My work in chronology and theology is of equal, if not greater, importance to me than my work in natural philosophy.
94. Prophecy is history written beforehand.
95. The true frame of nature is to be found not in the confused speculations of the schools, but in the clear language of mathematics applied to experiment.
96. The forces which keep the planets in their orbits are not mechanical, like vortices, but mathematical and centripetal.
97. The amount of matter in the universe is constant, and so is the total quantity of motion (momentum), when rightly calculated.
98. The same principle of analysis—of resolution and composition—applies to light, to motion, and to the quadrature of curves.
99. The purpose of experiments is not to produce spectacular effects, but to answer specific questions posed to nature.
100. The whole burden of philosophy seems to consist in this: from the phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena.

Here are 100 Newtonian positions on optics, synthesized from his *Opticks*, correspondence, and philosophical legacy:

1. **Light is not aether.** It is not a modification of a luminous medium, but consists of distinct corporeal particles.
2. **Light consists of corpuscles** emitted in all directions from shining bodies.
3. **These corpuscles are exceedingly small** and travel with immense speed.
4. **They obey the same mechanical laws** as other matter: they have mass, momentum, and inertia.
5. **White light is not pure, simple, or homogeneous.** It is a heterogeneous mixture of different rays.
6. **Each color is original, innate, and immutable.** A red ray is fundamentally and always red.
7. **Colors are not modifications of white light** created by the prism; the prism merely separates what is already there.
8. **The prism's function is analytic:** it resolves light into its component parts, like a chemist resolving a compound.
9. **The spectrum's elongation proves heterogeneity.** If light were homogeneous, the refracted image would be circular.
10. **Different colors possess different degrees of refrangibility.** Violet is bent most, red least.
11. **Refrangibility is an immutable property** of each ray; a red ray cannot be made more refrangible.
12. **Light corpuscles of different colors are of different sizes or masses,** causing different refrangibility.
13. **The recombination of all spectral colors produces white light again.** Synthesis proves prior analysis was correct.
14. **The rainbow is nature's experiment** proving the composition of white light from colors.
15. **Reflection is not due to light "bouncing" off a surface like a ball,** but to a short-range force repelling the corpuscle.
16. **The law of equal angles for reflection** is a necessary consequence of corpuscular mechanics.
17. **Refraction is caused by an attractive force** near the surface of a denser medium, accelerating the corpuscle.
18. **The sine law of refraction** follows mathematically from this acceleration perpendicular to the interface.
19. **Light travels faster in denser media** (a key difference from the wave theory).
20. **The phenomena of thin plates** (Newton's Rings) reveal a new periodic property of light.
21. **These rings are not explained by simple corpuscular paths.** They require an additional principle.
22. **I introduce "Fits of easy Reflection and easy Transmission."** These are periodic dispositions of the rays.
23. **A "Fit of easy Reflection"** is a state where the ray is disposed to be reflected.
24. **A "Fit of easy Transmission"** is a state where it is disposed to be transmitted.
25. **These Fits alternate** regularly as the ray propagates.
26. **The interval between Fits** depends on the color of the light; it is a periodic length.
27. **These Fits explain the rings:** where the thickness of the air film causes the returning ray to be in a Fit of Reflection, a dark ring appears (destructive effect).
28. **I do not feign a hypothesis for the cause of these Fits.** I describe them mathematically as a property.
29. **They may arise from a kind of vibration** or undulation excited in the corpuscle by its motion.
30. **This is not a wave theory of light,** but a vibration *associated with* a corpuscle.
31. **Diffraction (or inflection)** is caused by the attraction or repulsion of light corpuscles passing very close to edges of bodies.
32. **The colored fringes of diffraction** are due to the different attractions/repulsions for different colored corpuscles.
33. **Double refraction in Iceland Spar** proves light has "sides" or different properties in different orientations.
34. **I call this property "the two sides of a ray,"** a precursor to polarization.
35. **It suggests light corpuscles are not spherical** but have some asymmetrical shape or orientation.
36. **Bodies appear colored** because they are disposed to reflect some sorts of rays more copiously than others.
37. **A red cloth predominantly reflects red corpuscles** and absorbs or transmits the others.
38. **Transparency is due to the rarity of reflecting surfaces** within a medium for most rays.
39. **Opacity is due to the multitude of internal reflections** which scatter light until it is absorbed.
40. **The rays which make up light differ** in their dispositions to be reflected, refracted, or absorbed.
41. **The permanent colors of natural bodies** are proof of the immutability of color rays.
42. **The eye does not create color;** it is a sensor for the pre-existing colored rays.
43. **Vision is caused by these corpuscles** striking the retina.
44. **The sensation of white** is produced by a mixture of all color sensations, stimulated by the mixture of rays.
45. **The telescope's great flaw is chromatic aberration.** Lenses act as prisms, fringing images with color.
46. **Chromatic aberration is insurmountable** in lens-based (refracting) telescopes because refrangibility and color are inseparable.
47. **I therefore invented the reflecting telescope,** which uses mirrors that reflect all colors equally.
48. **The mirror eliminates the problem** by bringing all rays to a common focus regardless of color.
49. **The sharpness of shadows** proves light travels in straight lines, as corpuscles would.
50. **If light were a wave motion in an aether,** shadows would not be sharp; sound waves bend around corners.
51. **The aether, if it exists,** is not a luminous medium but may be a subtle, elastic fluid filling space.
52. **Its density varies,** being rarer in the pores of bodies and denser in free space.
53. **It may be the cause of gravity** and of the fits of reflection/transmission, but this is a query, not an assertion.
54. **Light can excite heat** in bodies it falls upon; the conversion of motion to heat is a mechanical process.
55. **Light can put bodies into vibration,** and this vibration is felt as heat.
56. **The phenomenon of "Newton's disc"** (a spinning painted disc appears white) is a decisive proof of color synthesis.
57. **Musical notes and colors are analogous.** The spectrum is like a scale, with red and violet as octaves.
58. **There may be a mathematical harmony** governing the refrangibilities of different colors.
59. **The study of optics is the first step** in investigating the active principles and forces of nature at a small scale.
60. **Optical experiments are the surest guide.** One must "assay" light as a goldsmith assays gold.
61. **All experiments on colors agree** with the doctrine of the heterogeneity of white light.
62. **This doctrine is not a hypothesis,** but a truth deduced from experiments and proved by synthesis.
63. **The colors of natural bodies** are a kind of permanent analysis performed by matter.
64. **The world is not colored;** it is populated with substances that selectively return certain rays to our eyes.
65. **The blue of the sky** is likely due to the preferential scattering of the most refrangible rays by minute particles in the air.
66. **The redness of the setting sun** is due to the least refrangible rays penetrating the thick atmosphere best.
67. **My rings experiment is a ruler** for measuring the minute thicknesses of thin films with incredible precision.
68. **The "critical thickness"** for a color in a soap bubble is a measurable, reproducible quantity.
69. **Light exerts pressure.** The comet's tail always pointing from the sun hints at this (a query).
70. **Light and matter may be interconvertible.** ("Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another?")
71. **This suggests a great unity** in nature, where the most subtle and grossest forms of matter obey related laws.
72. **The optical properties of a body** are determined by the size, shape, and arrangement of its ultimate particles.
73. **Differently sized corpuscles of light** may combine with matter differently, explaining chemical effects of light.
74. **The rays of the spectrum have different heating powers,** the least refrangible (red/infra-red) being most heating.
75. **The rays have different chemical powers,** the most refrangible (violet/ultra-violet) being most potent in causing changes.
76. **This proves the diversity of rays** is not just a visual phenomenon, but a physical one.
77. **The eye's lens suffers from chromatic aberration,** but the mind compensates; we do not see colored fringes in life.
78. **The perfection of God's design** is seen in the mathematical regularity of optical phenomena.
79. **The laws of optics, like those of motion,** are universal, simple, and few.
80. **My method in the *Opticks*** is to proceed from experiments to propositions, without hypothesizing.
81. **The "Queries" at the end of the *Opticks*** are not assertions, but questions to guide future investigation.
82. **The wave theory (of Huygens) fails** to explain rectilinear propagation and sharp shadows.
83. **If light were waves in an aether,** they would spread into the geometrical shadow, as sound and water waves do.
84. **Polarization (my "two sides")** is fatal to a simple longitudinal wave theory.
85. **The aether's existence is questionable** because planetary motion shows no detectable resistance.
86. **Yet, some medium may be necessary** to explain gravity, cohesion, and the fits of light.
87. **The primary business of optics** is not to explain the *cause* of properties, but to discover and mathematize the properties themselves.
88. **Color is as real a property** as mass or velocity; it is not an illusion.
89. **The microscope, like the telescope,** is limited by chromatic aberration.
90. **A reflecting microscope** would, in principle, be superior.
91. **The sensation of light** is immediate, proving the immense speed of the corpuscles.
92. **The finite speed of light** (from Roemer's observations of Jupiter's moons) is consistent with corpuscles having mass.
93. **Stars twinkle** due to refraction in the unsteady atmosphere, not an intrinsic property of starlight.
94. **The rainbow's secondary bow** with reversed colors is explained by two internal reflections in the raindrop.
95. **The dark band (Alexander's band)** between the primary and secondary bows is a region where no rays reach the eye.
96. **The mathematical calculation of the rainbow's angle** (42° for primary, 51° for secondary) is a triumph of optical geometry.
97. **The colors of feathers, pearls, and opals** are like the colors of thin plates, from the minute structure of their surfaces.
98. **The iridescence of clouds** sometimes seen is a large-scale demonstration of thin-film interference.
99. **Optics reveals that nature operates** with a hidden, sub-visible geometry.
100. **The ultimate particles of light and matter** are the alphabets with which God wrote the Book of Nature; optics is our grammar.

Here are 100 Newtonian positions on mechanics, synthesized from his *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, correspondence, and intellectual legacy:

**Foundational Principles**
1. **Absolute, true, and mathematical time** flows uniformly without relation to anything external.
2. **Absolute, true, and mathematical space** remains always similar and immovable.
3. **Absolute place** is a part of absolute space occupied by a body.
4. **Absolute motion** is the translation of a body from one absolute place to another.
5. **Relative motion** is the change of position relative to other bodies, which are considered at rest.
6. **The natural state of a body** is not rest, but to persist in its uniform state of motion or rest.
7. **Matter possesses *vis insita*** — an innate force of inertia, a power of resisting change.
8. **This inertial force** is proportional to the quantity of matter in the body.
9. **Mass is the measure of quantity of matter**, arising from its density and bulk conjointly.
10. **Mass is distinct from weight** — the latter is a *force* acting upon mass.

**Laws of Motion**
11. **First Law (Law of Inertia):** Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.
12. **This law defines force** by its effect: that which changes a body's state of motion.
13. **Second Law:** The change in motion (momentum) is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which that force is impressed.
14. **In modern terms:** Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma), though Newton expressed it as change in momentum.
15. **Forces are additive** — multiple forces produce a resultant determined by vector composition.
16. **Third Law:** To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.
17. **Action and reaction** are mutual forces between two bodies, always equal and opposite.
18. **These mutual forces** act simultaneously and upon different bodies.
19. **This law governs all interactions** — collisions, tension in ropes, gravitational attraction.
20. **Without the Third Law**, conservation of momentum would be impossible.

**Motion and Forces**
21. **Momentum** is the quantity of motion, measured by mass times velocity.
22. **Centripetal force** is that by which bodies are drawn, impelled, or tend toward a point as to a center.
23. **Centrifugal force** (as experienced) is the reaction to centripetal constraint.
24. **Uniform circular motion** requires a constant centripetal force directed toward the center.
25. **The magnitude of centripetal force** is proportional to mass times velocity squared divided by radius.
26. **Orbital motion** is a state of continual falling toward a center, balanced by tangential velocity.
27. **Kepler's area law** (equal areas in equal times) proves a central force directed at the Sun.
28. **Kepler's harmonic law** reveals that the centripetal force varies as the inverse square of distance.
29. **The inverse-square law** is deducible from the phenomena of planetary motion.
30. **All deviations from Kepler's laws** (perturbations) are due to additional forces from other bodies.

**Gravity**
31. **Gravity is a universal force** acting between all particles of matter.
32. **The gravitational force** is proportional to the product of the masses of the two bodies.
33. **It decreases** as the square of the distance between their centers increases.
34. **The gravitational constant** is universal but its numerical value must be determined by experiment.
35. **Gravity explains** both celestial and terrestrial motions with one principle.
36. **The same force** that makes an apple fall holds the Moon in orbit.
37. **The Moon's orbit** is a precise calculation of how far it "falls" toward Earth each second.
38. **Gravity is not an occult quality** — it is a mathematically defined force whose effects are precisely calculable.
39. **The cause of gravity** I do not feign hypotheses about; I demonstrate its laws from phenomena.
40. **Gravity may act at a distance** through empty space without any mediating medium.

**Systems and Mass**
41. **The center of mass** of a system moves as if all external forces acted on a particle with the system's total mass.
42. **Internal forces** (action-reaction pairs) cancel and do not affect the motion of the center of mass.
43. **Conservation of momentum** follows directly from the Third Law for isolated systems.
44. **In collisions**, the total momentum before impact equals the total momentum after impact.
45. **Elastic collisions** conserve both momentum and relative speed of approach and separation.
46. **Inelastic collisions** conserve momentum but not kinetic energy.
47. **The concept of mass-points** (particles) allows the mechanics of extended bodies to be analyzed.
48. **An extended rigid body** can be treated as a collection of mass-points rigidly connected.

**Resistance and Motion**
49. **Motion through resisting mediums** (like air or water) experiences a drag force.
50. **Drag is proportional** to some power of velocity and depends on the body's shape and medium's density.
51. **In a vacuum**, all bodies fall with the same acceleration regardless of mass.
52. **The famous "falling bodies" thought experiment** on the Moon proves air resistance is the cause of different falling rates.
53. **The pendulum's period** is independent of the bob's mass for small oscillations.
54. **The conical pendulum** directly measures the force required for circular motion.
55. **Terminal velocity** occurs when resistance equals motive force (like gravity).

**Work and Energy** (implicit in Newton)
56. **The concept of "work"** is latent in force acting through distance.
57. **Living force (*vis viva*)** — what we call kinetic energy — is proportional to mass times velocity squared.
58. **A falling body** gains *vis viva* in proportion to the height it falls.
59. **The principle of virtual work** underlies much of mechanical reasoning about equilibrium.
60. **Simple machines** (lever, pulley, inclined plane) trade force for distance.

**Rotational Motion**
61. **Angular momentum** conservation is implicit in the area law for central forces.
62. **A spinning rigid body** maintains its axis of rotation unless torqued.
63. **Precession** (like that of the equinoxes) results from a torque on a spinning body.
64. **The equatorial bulge** of Earth is due to rotation and creates the torque for precession.
65. **The tides** are a dynamical problem of forced oscillation under lunar and solar gravitational gradients.

**Hydrostatics and Dynamics**
66. **Pressure in a fluid** acts equally in all directions at a point.
67. **Hydrostatic pressure** increases linearly with depth.
68. **Archimedes' principle** follows from fluid pressure gradients.
69. **The speed of efflux** from a tank is proportional to the square root of the depth.
70. **Water waves** have speeds dependent on wavelength and depth.

**Methodology and Philosophy**
71. **The laws of mechanics are universal** — they apply equally to celestial and terrestrial bodies.
72. **Mechanics is mathematical** — its truths are deduced from axioms with geometrical rigor.
73. **Hypotheses have no place** in experimental philosophy; propositions are deduced from phenomena.
74. **The system of the world** is deducible from the laws of motion plus universal gravitation.
75. **Simplicity is a guide** — nature does not employ many causes when few suffice.
76. **The harmony of the solar system** argues for intelligent design of initial conditions.
77. **Mechanics reveals God's ongoing governance** through the conservation and regulation of motion.
78. **All apparent miracles** could be achieved by God working through natural laws, not against them.
79. **The first cause** (God) set matter in motion with precise initial velocities and positions.
80. **The stability of the solar system** requires occasional divine intervention to correct accumulating perturbations.

**Applications and Predictions**
81. **Comets are governed by gravity** and have predictable, often elliptical, orbits.
82. **The shape of Earth** is an oblate spheroid due to rotation — calculable from mechanics.
83. **The precession of the equinoxes** is calculable from lunar-solar torques on Earth's bulge.
84. **The tides' spring and neap cycles** result from vector addition of lunar and solar forces.
85. **The variation of gravity** with latitude is predictable from Earth's shape and rotation.
86. **Ballistic trajectories** are parabolic in uniform gravity without air resistance.
87. **The optimal angle for maximum range** is 45 degrees in vacuum.
88. **The motion of projectiles** including air resistance can be calculated by series expansion.
89. **The speed of sound** can be estimated from elastic properties of air.
90. **Saturn's rings** cannot be solid or they would be torn apart by differential gravity; they must consist of many small particles.

**Limits and Insights**
91. **The three-body problem** generally has no closed-form solution; approximations are needed.
92. **Perturbation theory** is necessary to calculate planetary motions accurately.
93. **Mechanics suggests but does not prove** the conservation of energy; that came later.
94. **The aether**, if it exists, must offer negligible resistance to planetary motion.
95. **Absolute space and time**, while unobservable, are necessary philosophical concepts.
96. **The bucket experiment** (rotating water in a bucket) demonstrates absolute rotation.
97. **Coriolis effects** are implicit in rotating frame analysis.
98. **The principle of least action**, later formalized, is suggested by efficient natural motions.
99. **Mechanics is complete** for macroscopic phenomena at ordinary speeds.
100. **Given the initial state and forces**, the future motion of any mechanical system is determined — a clockwork universe, set in motion by God.
