Here is a series of 100 positions in the spirit of Isaac Newton, reflecting his revolutionary ideas, his philosophical stance, and the core of the *Principia* and the *Opticks*.

1. The universe is a comprehensible machine governed by mathematical laws.
2. The task of natural philosophy is to deduce these laws from the phenomena of motion.
3. I do not frame hypotheses (*Hypotheses non fingo*)—I derive explanations from evidence.
4. The center of the universe is not a place, but the common center of gravity of all bodies, determined by the laws of motion and gravity.
5. Absolute, true, and mathematical time flows uniformly without relation to anything external.
6. Absolute, true, and mathematical space remains similar and immovable without relation to anything external.
7. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place to another.
8. The natural state of a body is not rest, but to persist in its state of motion or rest unless compelled to change by an impressed force.
9. Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.
10. The change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which that force is impressed.
11. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.
12. There is a force of gravity that extends to all bodies in the solar system and to the universe beyond.
13. Gravity is proportional to the quantity of matter in each body.
14. Gravity decreases as the square of the distance between the centers of two bodies increases.
15. The same force that causes an apple to fall on Earth holds the Moon in its orbit.
16. The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, a consequence of an inverse-square law force.
17. Comets are celestial objects governed by the same laws as planets and can return on predictable paths.
18. The tides are caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and the Sun upon the Earth's seas.
19. The Earth is not a perfect sphere but is flattened at the poles due to its rotation.
20. The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge.
21. The motions of celestial bodies are not due to vortices of a subtle ether, but to a universal force acting through empty space.
22. Light is not a modification of a medium, but consists of corpuscles emitted from shining bodies.
23. White light is not pure and homogeneous, but is a mixture of all the colors of the spectrum.
24. Colors are not modifications of white light, but original and innate properties of rays of different refrangibility.
25. A ray of light can be "fitted" for easy reflection or easy transmission, explaining the phenomena of thin films.
26. The colored rings seen in thin plates (Newton's rings) provide a measurable periodicity to the behavior of light.
27. The sharpness of shadows proves that light rays travel in straight paths.
28. The reflection telescope I invented, using a mirror, avoids the chromatic aberration inherent in lenses.
29. The study of optics reveals the precise and mathematical nature of even the most subtle phenomena.
30. The laws of motion and gravity demonstrate that the frame of the system of the world is the same as the frame of common things.
31. The first cause of the solar system is intelligent design; the beautiful arrangement of the planets could not arise from chance.
32. This most elegant system of the Sun, planets, and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.
33. God is a powerful, eternal, infinite, and perfectly intelligent Being who constitutes duration and space.
34. God endures forever and is present everywhere, and by existing always and everywhere, He constitutes duration and space.
35. He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite; not duration or space, but He endures and is present.
36. We know Him only by His most wise and excellent contrivances of things and final causes.
37. A continual miracle is not needed to keep the planets in their orbits; the laws of motion and gravity suffice.
38. The ultimate reason for gravity is not a mechanical cause, but the direct will and means of the Creator.
39. The variety of motion in the universe is always decreasing, requiring an active principle to replenish it.
40. The fixed stars are at immense distances so as not to fall into one another by their mutual gravity.
41. The universe is possibly infinite in extent and contains many such systems as our own.
42. The resistance experienced by pendulums proves the existence of a subtle, elastic medium—the aether—though its role is not gravitational.
43. Alchemy is a worthy pursuit for investigating the active principles and intimate structures of matter.
44. The Book of Daniel and the Revelation of St. John are the keys to understanding the prophecies and the timeline of sacred history.
45. The study of nature and the study of scripture are two windows into the mind of God; they cannot truly contradict.
46. Absolute space is the sensorium of God—the medium through which He perceives and orders the universe.
47. Mathematical principles are not mere conveniences, but the true language in which the Creator wrote the world.
48. The quantity of matter (mass) is the measure of the same, arising from its density and bulk conjointly.
49. The quantity of motion (momentum) is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly.
50. The innate force of matter (*vis insita*) is the power of resisting by which every body perseveres in its state.
51. An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body to change its state.
52. The centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn, impelled, or tend toward a point as to a center.
53. The resistance of a medium is proportional to the density of that medium and the surface and velocity of the body moving through it.
54. The motion of bodies in resisting mediums can be calculated with precision.
55. The wave theory of light is insufficient to explain its rectilinear propagation and the sharpness of shadows.
56. The fits of easy reflection and easy transmission are a mathematical description of periodic behavior in light, not a hypothesis about its cause.
57. I do not concern myself with the ultimate cause of gravity; it is enough that it exists, acts according to my laws, and accounts for all celestial and terrestrial motions.
58. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
59. Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.
60. Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest friend is truth.
61. Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy.
62. I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.
63. To myself I am only a child playing on the seashore, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.
64. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I leave to the consideration of my readers.
65. It is the perfection of God's works that they are all done with the greatest simplicity.
66. The wondrous uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice.
67. The best and safest method of philosophizing seems to be, first to inquire diligently into the properties of things, and establishing those properties by experiments, and then to proceed more slowly to hypotheses for their explanation.
68. Atheism is so senseless and odious to mankind that it never had many professors.
69. This most beautiful system [of the world] could only proceed from the dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.
70. No great discovery was ever made without a bold guess.
71. Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.
72. Live your life as an exclamation rather than an explanation.
73. What we know is a drop, what we don't know is an ocean.
74. The seeds of great discoveries are constantly floating around us, but they only take root in minds well prepared to receive them.
75. If others would think as hard as I did, they would get similar results.
76. My work in mathematics was done mostly to satisfy my own mind and to pass the time in my solitude.
77. The diamond is the most precious of stones, and yet more precious is knowledge.
78. The inverse-square law is written in the very fabric of the cosmos, evident in the spreading of light, sound, and force.
79. All the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea are deducible from the principle of gravity.
80. The same simplicity of principle that governs the fall of a stone governs the motions of the cosmos.
81. The business of natural philosophy is to argue from phenomena without feigning hypotheses, and to deduce causes from effects.
82. The laws of motion are the foundation upon which the entire structure of rational mechanics is built.
83. Matter is inert and passive; its motion arises solely from active principles and impressed forces.
84. The primary qualities of bodies—solidity, extension, figure, and mobility—are universal and mathematical.
85. Secondary qualities—colors, sounds, tastes—are but sensations in the perceiving mind, produced by the primary qualities of bodies.
86. The ultimate particles of matter are solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable, and endowed with inertia.
87. God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles.
88. It seems probable to me that God in the beginning formed matter in such a way that these particles could be neither broken nor worn out.
89. The changing of bodies into light, and light into bodies, is very conformable to the course of nature.
90. Nature is pleased with simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.
91. The unity and harmony of the cosmic design argue for a single, sovereign Creator.
92. The system of the world reveals a counsel and dominion that is intelligent and powerful.
93. My work in chronology and theology is of equal, if not greater, importance to me than my work in natural philosophy.
94. Prophecy is history written beforehand.
95. The true frame of nature is to be found not in the confused speculations of the schools, but in the clear language of mathematics applied to experiment.
96. The forces which keep the planets in their orbits are not mechanical, like vortices, but mathematical and centripetal.
97. The amount of matter in the universe is constant, and so is the total quantity of motion (momentum), when rightly calculated.
98. The same principle of analysis—of resolution and composition—applies to light, to motion, and to the quadrature of curves.
99. The purpose of experiments is not to produce spectacular effects, but to answer specific questions posed to nature.
100. The whole burden of philosophy seems to consist in this: from the phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena.
