Abstract

Contemporary "protective" sex-trafficking statutes and their media afterlife promise egalitarian justice but deliver Victorian paternalism in new clothes. By expanding "coercion" to include broad, elastic forms of psychological influence and by defining "commercial sex" as any exchange of value, these laws collapse the boundary between crime and bad judgment. Prosecutors gain theatrical villains; adults who entered degrading arrangements are rebranded as legally infantilized victims. This essay argues that such regimes invoke Rawls's difference principle while reproducing archaic gender archetypes. The cure is not libertinism but bright-line moral minimalism: punish force, fraud, and confinement mercilessly; refuse to criminalize consensual degradation; and stop deputizing courts to launder shame.

1. The puzzle

Two facts can both be true and still produce intellectual whiplash. First, some men (and institutions) exploit sex and power in ways that are predatory and deserve punishment. Second, a great deal of what now gets prosecuted and narrated as "sex trafficking" would have been described, a generation ago, as adults entering ugly bargains for status, belonging, or advancement—and later regretting it. The gap between those facts is bridged not by new moral insight but by a redefinition of coercion so elastic it swallows consent itself.

This is sold as egalitarian progress. In truth, it revives archaic chivalry—women as delicate innocents, men as dragon or knight—while claiming Rawlsian inspiration. The veil of ignorance was meant to deflate bias; in practice it supplies a screen for projecting cultural fantasy.

2. Rawls without a veil

Rawls's device asks lawmakers to choose principles behind a veil that hides their identity. No one can do that. We don't un-become ourselves; we simulate neutrality with the furniture of our culture. When the theorist imagines the "least advantaged," the image smuggles in familiar archetypes. In the domain of sex and power, the archetypes are preloaded: vulnerable woman, predatory man, redemptive state. The result is white-knight equality—a purportedly neutral regime that treats adult women as wards requiring rescue.

That is not equality; it is asymmetric infantilization. It writes into law the old Victorian story, only with woke subtitles: the damsel is now "survivor," the dragon is "trafficker," the knight is "the people." The content did not mature; only the diction did.

3. How the laundering works

The laundering proceeds in three steps.

Step 1: Expand "coercion."
Move from force and confinement to "pressure," "dependency," "fear of shame," or "implied consequences." Make reputational risk a weapon equivalent to a lock and a chain.

Step 2: Expand "commercial sex."
Detach "commercial" from money. Let status, mentorship, role prominence, or mere proximity to influence count as "consideration." Now any sexual exchange inside a hierarchy can be reframed as commercial—especially if it later ends badly.

Step 3: Moralize ex post.
Once the relationship collapses, reperiodize the whole affair under the new vocabulary. What were once degrading but voluntary choices become episodes in a narrative of "survival." The adult who bargained poorly is reconceived as someone whose agency was voided by the system she joined.

Cults make this easy. Their operating system is recursive victimization: members accept small lies, tell them to others, then enforce them. Each threshold crossed reduces cognitive dissonance and deepens complicity. By the time overt abuse appears—branding, sexual access as loyalty tests—the person is both harmed and an instrument of harm. The legal script cannot represent that double occupancy of roles. It prefers clean one-way arrows: perpetrator → victim. So the complexity is flattened into a morality play.

4. The epistemic injury

What cult leaders and mid-tier manipulators actually steal is less bodies than judgment. The injury is epistemic. They trap bright people with rationed approval, jargon, counterfeit accountability, and intermittent wins. The most precious resource in adult life is time; the second is one's sense of being sane. These are the goods such systems confiscate.

When the spell breaks, the shame is unbearable. It is safer for the public tale to say "you were trafficked" than to say "you were used and you cooperated." The first anesthetizes; the second demands a reckoning. The law obligingly supplies anesthesia. Headlines confirm what hurt people want to hear: your consent wasn't consent. Your participation wasn't participation. You are clean. He is the monster. Relief floods in. So does paternalism disguised as justice.

5. The MLM mirror

If you think the above is only about sex, you have not looked hard at multi-level marketing. Schemes like insurance-adjacent sales or supplement pyramids rely on what might be called moral multipliers: for every dollar extracted from you, you must extract multiples from others to recover. Hope is monetized; sunk costs are spiritualized ("invest in yourself"); "training" becomes a tax on loyalty.

Most recruits lose money; a tiny layer up top earns a small-business living by selling belief maintenance: retreats, prep classes, "optional" conventions. The participants are simultaneously scammed and scamming, ashamed and aggressive, lured and luring. The roles blur. So does blame.

Our law knows how to punish theft; it does not know what to do with self-entrapment—when adults build their own cages one rationalization at a time. The temptation is to call the end state "victimhood" and move on. But well-designed justice refuses to let the end erase the means.

6. Paternalism with better branding

Why call this archaic? Because the moral architecture is 1910 with better fonts. The early "white-slavery" campaigns were explicit: women must be protected, even against their own appetites and ambitions; men must be constrained, even against facts. We have kept the template and switched the captions. The effect on law is predictable:

Consent becomes provisional. If sex and hierarchy intertwine, a woman's "yes" can be retroactively converted into "no" by reference to climate, feelings, or career stakes.

Agency becomes a function of outcome. If the story ends badly, the earlier choices are reinterpreted as compelled.

Virtue performance becomes evidence. Grandiose rescues, weepy press conferences, maximalist charges—these are treated not merely as politics but as proof that a crime of a certain gravity occurred.

All of this flatters the rescuer. It also teaches adults—especially women—that the law will bless their regret if the relationship was unequal and the optics appalling. That is not empowerment. It is dependence dressed as care.

7. The case for hard lines

The antidote is not libertinism. It is bright-line moral minimalism:

Punish force, fraud, and confinement mercilessly. Physical coercion, explicit threats of violence, deception about material facts (age, disease status, contractual terms), surveillance, blackmail with stolen or fabricated material—these are crimes because they annihilate agency in recognizable ways.

Refuse to criminalize consensual degradation. Adults can strike terrible bargains. They can trade sex for status, submit to branding rituals, and enforce stupid hierarchies on others. Such arrangements can be immoral, pathetic, and corrosive. They can justify civil remedies or institutional expulsions. They are not felonies if entered voluntarily with eyes open and exits available.

Recognize recursive roles. Where systems cultivate complicity—cults, MLMs, "guru" organizations—distinguish primary victimization (direct threats, confinement, fraud) from participatory victimization (self-deception and enforcement of norms on others). Reserve criminal law for the former; treat the latter as a social and moral failure to be answered with exposure, restitution, and reputational consequence.

Stop deputizing courts to launder shame. The state's job is not to rewrite autobiographies so citizens can live with their past. The cure for being fooled is truth and time, not a prosecutor telling your story the tidy way.

8. Rawls, revised

Rawls's core insight—that we should design institutions as if we could be anyone—remains valuable. The correction is methodological: do not pretend to stand behind a veil you cannot inhabit. Instead, run your policies through a de-mythologized difference principle:

Ask, "Does this rule protect agency without stereotyping identity?"

Ask, "Could an adult woman under this rule retain the burden of her yes?"

Ask, "Could an adult man under this rule be judged on facts rather than fantasy roles?"

If the answer to any is no, your justice is chivalry with a graduate seminar gloss.

9. Objections and replies

Objection: Broad trafficking statutes are needed because psychological coercion is real.
Reply: No one denies psychological coercion. The question is when it voids consent. If you let "fear of disapproval" or "career pressure" qualify, you have criminalized ordinary human leverage. Tailor the definition to concrete domination: threats to safety, property, liberty, or fabricated reputational bombs; deception about material facts; sustained isolation that functionally prevents exit. Draw lines you can defend without reciting poetry.

Objection: Narrowing the law abandons the vulnerable.
Reply: The truly vulnerable—minors, undocumented migrants, the physically confined—are covered by the hard-line criteria above. You do not empower adults by lowering the threshold of victimhood until it meets their regret. You erase them.

Objection: This analysis excuses predators.
Reply: It does the opposite: it targets predation precisely where agency is destroyed, and it refuses to inflate numbers with cases that are spiritually ugly but legally consensual. Moral seriousness is not measured by charge inflation.

10. Conclusion: against theatrical justice

A mature legal culture resists the urge to turn every moral mess into a criminal pageant. It can hold two truths at once: (1) some leaders and institutions are exploiters whose defining talent is to weaponize shame; (2) many adults who orbit them do so because degradation pays—until it doesn't. The way out is not to rename regret "trafficking," nor to pretend the veil of ignorance can be worn like a mask. The way out is to punish real coercion hard, to leave consensual degradation to civil remedies and social sanction, and to stop turning courtrooms into theaters where shame gets laundered into innocence.

Justice should be a scalpel, not a pageant. If we want citizens, not wards, we must stop writing laws that talk to archetypes and start writing laws that respect the complicated, uncomfortable fact of adult agency—even when adults use it badly.
