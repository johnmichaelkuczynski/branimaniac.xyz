THE 
PHILOSOPHY 
OF 
BERGSON.* 


The 
classification 
of 
philosophies 
is 
effected, 
as 
a 
rule, 
either 
by 
their 
methods 
or 
by 
their 
lesults 
: 
"empirical" 
and 
" 
a 
priori 
" 
is 
a 
classification 
by 
methods, 
" 
realist 
" 
and 
" 
idealist 
" 
is 
a 
classification 
by 
results. 
An 
attempt 
to 
classify 
Bergson's 
philosophy 
in 
either 
of 
these 
ways 
is 
hardly 
likely 
to 
be 
successful, 
since 
it 
cuts 
across 
all 
the 
recognised 
divisions. 


But 
there 
is 
another 
way 
of 
classifying 
philosophies, 
less 
precise, 
but 
perhaps 
more 
helpful 
to 
the 
non-philosophical 
; 
in 
this 
way, 
the 
principle 
of 
division 
is 
according 
to 
the 
predominant 
desire 
which 
has 
led 
the 
philosopher 
to 
philosophize. 
Thus 
we 
shall 
have 
philosophies 
of 
feeling 
inspired 
by 
the 
love 
of 
happiness 
; 
theoretical 
philosophies, 
inspired 
by 
the 
love 
of 
knowledge 
; 
and 
practical 
philosophies, 
inspired 
by 
the 
love 
of 
action. 


Among 
philosophies 
of 
feeling 
we 
shall 
place 
all 
those 
which 
are 
primarily 
optimistic 
or 
pessimistic, 
all 
those 
that 
offer 
schemes 
of 
salvation 
or 
try 
to 
prove 
that 
salvation 
is 
impossible 
; 
to 
this 
class 
belong 
most 
religious 
philosophies. 
Among 
theoretical 
philosophies 
we 
shall 
place 
most 
of 
the

great 
systems 
; 
for 
though 
the 
desire 
for 
knowledge 
is 
rare, 
it 
has 
been 
the 
source 
of 
most 
of 
what 
is 
best 
in 
philosophy. 
Practical 
philosophies, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
will 
be 
those 
which 
regard 
action 
as 
the 
supreme 
good, 
considering 
happiness 
an 
effect 
and 
knowledge 
a 
mere 
instrument 
of 
successful 
activity. 
Philosophies 
of 
this 
type 
would 
have 
been 
common 
among 
Western 
Europeans 
if 
philosophers 
had 
been 
average 
men 
; 
as 
it 
is, 
they 
have 
been 
rare 
until 
recent 
times, 
in 
fact 
their 
chief 
representatives 
are 
the 
pragmatists 
and 
M. 
Bergson. 
In 
the 
rise 
of 
this 
type 
of 
philosophy 
we 
may 
see, 
as 
M. 
Bergson 
himself 
does, 
the 
revolt 
ot 
the 
modern 
man 
of 
action 
against 
the 
authority 
of 
Greece, 
and 
more 
particularly 
of 
Plato 
; 
or 
we 
may 
connect 
it, 
as 
Dr. 
Schiller 
apparently 
would 
with 
imperialism 
and 
the 
motor 
car. 
The 
modern 
world 
calls 
for 
such 
a 
philosophy, 
and 
the 
success 
which 
it 
has 
achieved 
is 
therefore 
not 
surprising. 


M. 
Bergson's 
philosophy, 
unlike 
most 
of 
the 
systems 
of 
the 
past, 
is 
dualistic 
: 
the 
woild, 
for 
him, 
is 
divided 
into 
two 
disparate 
portions, 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
life, 
on 
the 
other 
matter, 
or 
rather 
that 
inert 
something 
which 
the 
intellect 
views 
as 
matter. 
The 
whole 
universe 
is 
the 
clash 
and 
conflict 
of 
two 

opposite 
motions 
: 
life, 
which 
climbs 
upward, 
and 
matter, 
which 
falls 
downward. 
Life 
is 
one 
great 
force, 
one 
vast 
vital 
impulse, 
given 
once 
for 
all 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
world, 
meeting 
the 
resistance 
of 
matter, 
struggling 
to 
break 
a 
way 
through 
matter, 
learning 
gradually 
to 
use 
matter 
by 
means 
of 
organisation 
; 
divided 
by 
the 
obstacles 
it 
encounters 
into 
diverging 
currents, 
like 
the 
wind 
at 
the 
street 
corner 
; 
partly 
subdued 
by 
matter 
through 
the 
very 
adaptations 
which 
matter 
forces 
upon 
it; 
yet 
retaining 
always 
its 
capacity 
for 
free 
activity, 
struggling 
always 
to 
find 
new 
outlets, 
seeking 
always 
for 
greater 
liberty 
of 
movement 
amid 
the 
opposing 
walls 
of, 
matter. 


Evolution 
is 
not 
primaiily 
explicable 
by 
adaptation 
to 
environment; 
adaptation 
explains 
only 
the 
turns 
and 
twists 
of 
evolution, 
like 
the 
windings 
of 
a 
road 
approaching 
a 
town 
through 
hilly 
country. 
But 
this 
simile 
is 
not 
quite 
adequate 
; 


t 


there 
is 
no 
town, 
no 
definite 
goal, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
road 
along 
which 
evolution 
travels. 
Mechanism 
and 
teleology 
suffer 
from 
the 
same 
defect 
: 
both 
suppose 
that 
there 
is 
no 
essential 
novelty 
in 
the 
world. 
Mechanism 
regards 
the 
future 
as 
implicit 
in 
the 
past, 
since 
it 
believes 
the 
future 
to 
be 
calculable 
; 
teleology 
also, 
since 
it 
believes 
that 
the 
end 
to 
be 
achieved 
can 
be 
known 
in 
advance, 
denies 
that 
any 
essential 
novelty 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
result. 


As 
against 
both 
these 
views, 
though 
with 
more 
sympathy 
for 
teleology 
than 
for 
mechanism, 
J" 
M. 
Bergson 
maintains 
that 
evolution 
is 
truly 
creative, 
like 
the 
work 
of 
an 
artist. 
An 
impulse 
to 
action, 
an 
undefined 
want, 
exists 
beforehand, 
but 
until 
the 
want 
is 
satisfied 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
know 
the 
nature 
of 
what 
will 
satisfy 
it. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
suppose 
some 
vague 
desire 
in 
sightless 
animals 
to 
be 
able 
to 
be 
aware 
of 
objects 
before 
they 
were 
in 
contact 
with 
them. 
This 
led 
to 
efforts 
which 
finally 
resulted 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
eyes. 
Sight 
satisfied 
the 
desire, 
but 
could 
not 
have 
been 
imagined 
beforehand. 
For 
this 
reason, 
evolution 
is 
unpredictable, 
and 
determinism 
cannot 
refute 
the 
advocates 
of 
free 
will. 


This 
broad 
outline 
is 
filled 
in 
by 
an 
account 
of 
the 
actual 
development 
oi 
life 
on 
the 
earth. 
The 
first 
division 
of 
the 
current 
was 
into 
plants 
and 
animals 
: 
plants 
aimed 
at 
storing 
up 
energy 
in 
a 
reservoir, 
animals 
aimed 
at 
using 
energy 
for 
sudden 
and 
rapid 
movements. 
"The 
same 
impetus," 
he 
says, 
" 
that 
has 
led 
the 
animal 
to 
give 
itself 
nerves 
and 
nerve 
centres 
must 
have 
ended, 
in 
the 
plant, 
in 
the 
chlorophyllian 
function" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
120). 
But 
among 
animals, 
at 
a 
later 
stage, 
a 
new 
bifurcation 
appeared 
: 
instinct 
and 
intellect 
became 



more 
or 
less 
separated. 
They 
are 
never 
wholly 
without 
each 
other, 
but 
in 
the 
main 
intellect 
is 
the 
misfortune 
of 
man, 
while 
instinct 
is 
seen 
at 
its 
best 
in 
ants, 
bees, 
and 
Bergson. 
The 
division 
between 
intellect 
and 
instinct 
is 
fundamental 
in 
his 
philosophy, 
much 
of 
which 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
Sandford 
and 
Merton, 
with 
instinct 
as 
the 
good 
boy 
and 
intellect 
as 
the 
bad 
boy. 


Instinct 
at 
its 
best 
is 
called 
intuition. 
" 
By 
intuition," 


he 
says, 
" 
I 
mean 
instinct 
that 
has 
become 
disinterested, 
self 
conscious, 
capable 
of 
reflecting 
upon 
its 
object 
and 
of 
enlarging 
it 
indefinitely 
" 
(C. 
E., 


p. 
186). 
The 
account 
of 
the 
doings 
of 
intchect 
is 
not 
always 
easy 
to 
follow, 
but 
if 
we 
are 
to 
understand 
Bergson 
we 
murt 
do 
our 
best. 
Intelligence 
or 
intellect, 
" 
as 
it 
leaves 
the 
hands 
of 
nature, 
has 
for 
its 
chief 
object 
the 
inorganic 
solid 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
162) 
; 
it 
can 
only 
form 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
the 
discontinuous 
and 
the 
immobile 
(pp. 
163-4) 
> 
its 
concepts 
are 
outside 
each 
other 
like 
objects 
in 
space, 
and 
have 
the 
same 
stability 
(p. 
169). 
The 
intellect 
separates 
in 
space 
and 
fixes 
in 
time 
; 
it 
is 
not 
made 
to 
think 
evolution, 
but 
represent 
becoming 
as 
a 
series 
of 
states 
(p. 
171). 
" 
The 
intellect 
is 
characterised 
by 
a 
natural 
inability 
to 
understand 
life 
" 
(p. 
174) 
; 
geometry 
and 
logic, 
which 
are 
its 
typical 
products, 
are 
strictly 
applicable 
to 
solid 
bodies, 
but 
elsewhere 
reasoning 
must 
be 
checked 
by 
common 
sense, 
which, 
as 
Bergson 
truly 
says, 
is 
a 
very 
different 
thing 
(p. 
170). 
Solid 
bodies, 
it 
would 
seem, 
are 
something 
which 
mind 
has 
created 
on 
purpose 
to 
apply 
intellect 
to 
them, 
much 
as 
it 
has 
created 
chess-boards 
in 
order 
to 
play 
chess 
on 
them. 
The 
genesis 
of 
intellect 
and 
the 
genesis 
of 
material 
bodies, 
we 
are 
told, 
are 
correlative 
: 
both 
have 
been 
developed 
by 
reciprocal 
adaptation 
(p. 
196). 
" 
An 
identical 
process 
must 
have 
cut 
out 
matter 
and 
the 
intellect, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
from 
a 
stuff 
that 
contained 
both 
" 
(p. 
210). 


This 
conception 
of 
the 
simultaneous 
growth 
of 
matter 
and 
intellect 
is 
ingenious, 
and 
deserves 
to 
be 
understood. 
Broadly, 
I 
think, 
what 
is 
meant 
is 
this 
: 
Intellect 
is 
the 
power 
of 
seeing 
thing? 
as 
separate 
one 
from 
another, 
and 
matter 
is 
that 
which 
is 
separated 
into 
distinct 
things 
In 
reality 
there 
are 
no 
separate 
solid 
things, 
only 
an 
end]ess 
stream 
of 
becoming, 
in 
which 
nothing 
becomes 
and 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
this 
nothing 
becomes. 
But 
becoming 
may 
be 
a 
movement 
up 
or 
a 
movement 
down 
: 
when 
it 
is 
a 
movement 
up 
it 
is 
called 
life, 
when 
it 
is 
a 
movement 
down 
it 
is 
what, 
as 
misapprehended 
by 
the 
intellect, 
is 
called 
matter. 
I 
suppose 
the 
universe 
is 
shaped 
like 
a 
cone, 
with 
the 
Absolute 
at 
the 


vertex, 
for 
the 
movement 
up 
brings 
things 
together, 
while 
the 
movement 



down 
separates 
them, 
or 
at 
least 
seems 
to 
do 
so. 
In 
order 
that 
the 
upward 
motion 
of 
mind 
may 
be 
able 
to 
thread 
its 
way 
through 
the 
downward 
motion 
of 
the 
falling 
bodies 
which 
hail 
upon 
it, 
it 
must 
be 
able 
to 
cut 
out 
paths 
between 
them 
; 
thus 
as 
intelligence 
was 
formed, 
outlines 
and 
paths 
appeared 


(p. 
199), 
and 
the 
primitive 
flux 
was 
cut 
up 
into 
separate 
bodies. 
The 
intellect 
may 
be 
compared 
to 
a 
carver, 
but 
it 
has 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
imagining 
that 
the 
chicken 
was 
always 
the 
separate 
pieces 
into 
which 
the 
carving-knife 
divides 
it. 
" 
The 
intellect," 
Bergson 
says, 
" 
always 
behaves 
as 
if 
it 
were 
fascinated 
by 
the 
contemplation 
of 
inert 
matter. 
It 
is 
life 
looking 
outward, 
putting 
itself 
outside 
itself, 
adopting 
the 
ways 
of 
inorganised 
nature 
in 
principle, 
in 
order 
to 
direct 
them 
in 
fact 
" 
(p. 
170). 
If 
we 
may 
be 
allowed 
to 
add 
another 
image 
to 
the 
many 
by 
which 
Bergson's 
philosophy 
is 
illustrated, 
we 
may 
say 
tnat 
the 
universe 
is 
a 
vast 
funicular 
railway, 
in 
which 
life 
is 
the 
train 
that 
goes 
up, 
and 
matter 
is 
the 
train 
that 
goes 
down. 
The 
intellect 
consists 
in 
watching 
the 
descending 
train 
as 
it 
passes 
the 
ascending 
train 
in 
which 
we 
are. 
The 
obviously 
nobler 
faculty 
which 
concentrates 
its 
attention 
on 
our 
own 
train, 
is 
instinct 
or 
intuition. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
leap 
from 
one 
train 
to 
the 
other 
; 
this 
happens 
when 
we 
become 
the 
victims 
of 
automatic 
habit, 
and 
is 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
comic. 
Or 
we 
can 
divide 
ourselves 
into 
parts, 
one 
part 
going 
up 
and 
one 
down; 
then 
only 
the 
part 
going 
down 
is 
comic. 
But 
intellect 
is 
not 
itself 
a 
descending 
motion, 
it 
is 
merely 
an 
observation 
of 
the 
descending 
motion 
by 
the 
ascending 
motion. 


Intellect, 
which 
separates 
things, 
is, 
according 
to 
Bergson, 
a 
kind 
of 
dream; 
it 
is 
not 
active, 
as 
all 
our 
life 
ought 
to 
be, 
but 
purely 
contemplative. 
When 
we 
dream, 
he 
says, 
our 
self 
is 
scattered, 
our 
past 
is 
broken 
into 
fragments 
(p. 
212),* 


* 
It 
is 
noteworthy 
that 
elsewhere 
Bergson 
speaks 
of 
dreams 
as 
giving 
us 
duration 
more 
pure 
than 
in 
waking 
life 
(T. 
and 
F.W., 
p. 
126). 
thin^ 
which 
really 
interpenetrate 
each 
other 
are 
seen 
as 
separate 
solid 
units 
: 
the 
extra-spatial 
degrades 
itself 
into 
spatiality 
(p. 
218), 
which 
is 
nothing 
hut 
separateness. 
Thus 
all 
intellect, 
since 
it 
separates, 
tends 
to 
geometry, 
and 
logic, 
which 
deals 
with 
concepts 
that 
lie 
wholly 
outside 
each 
other, 
is 
really 
an 
outcome 
of 
geometry, 
following 
the 
direction 
of 
materiality 
(pp. 
222-4). 
Both 
deduction 
and 
induction 
require 
spatial 
intuition 
behind 
them 
(p. 
225) 
; 
" 
the 
movement 
at 
the 
end 
of 
which 
is 
spatiality 
lays 
down 
along 
its 
course 
the 
faculty 
of 
induction, 
as 
well 
as 
that 
of 
deduction, 
in 
fact, 



intellectuality 
entire." 
It 
creates 
them 
in 
mind, 
and 
also 
the 
order 
in 
things 
which 
the 
intellect 
finds 
there 
(p. 
228). 
Thus 
logic 
and 
mathematics 
do 
not 
represent 
a 
positive 
spiritual 
effort 
(p. 
224), 
but 
a 
mere 
somnambulism, 
in 
which 
the 
will 
is 
suspended, 
and 
the 
mind 
is 
no 
longer 
active. 
Incapacity 
for 
mathematics 
is 
therefore 
a 
sign 
of 
grace— 
fortunately 
a 
very 
common 
one. 


As 
intellect 
is 
connected 
with 
space, 
so 
instinct 
or 
intuition 
is 
connected 
with 
time. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
noteworthy 
features 
of 
Bergson's 
philosophy 
that, 
unlike 
most 
writers, 
he 
regards 
time 
and 
space 
as 
profoundly 
dissimilar. 
Space, 
the 
characteristic 
of 
matter, 
arises 
from 
a 
dissection 
of 
the 
flux 
which 
is 
really 
illusory, 
useful, 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point, 
in 
practice, 
but 
utterly 
misleading 
in 
theory. 
Time, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
is 
the 
essential 
characteristic 
of 
life 
or 
mind. 
" 
Wherever 
anything 
lives," 
he 
says, 
" 
there 
is, 
open 
somewhere, 
a 
register 
in 
which 
time 
is 
being 
inscribed" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
17). 
But 
the 
time 
here 
spoken 
of 
is 
not 
mathematical 
time, 
the 
homogeneous 
assemblage 
of 
mutually 
external 
instants. 
Mathematical 
time, 
according 
to 
Bergson, 
is 
really 
a 
form 
of 
space 
; 
the 
time 
which 
is 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
life 
is 
what 
he 
calls 
duration. 
This 
conception 
of 
duration 
is 
fundamental 
in 
his 
philosophy 
; 
it 
appears 
already 
in 
his 
earliest 
book 
Time 
and 
Free 
Will, 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
understand 
it 
if 
we 
are 
to 
have 
any 
comprehension 
of 
his 
system. 
It 
is, 
however, 
a 
very 
difficult 
conception. 
I 
do 
not 
fully 
under


stand 
it 
myself, 
and 
inerefore 
I 
cannot 
hope 
to 
explain 
it 
with 
all 
the 
lucidity 
which 
it 
doubtless 
deserves. 


" 
Pure 
duration," 
we 
are 
told, 
" 
is 
the 
form 
which 
our 
conscious 
states 
assume 
when 
our 
ego 
lets 
itself 
live, 
when 
it 
refrains 
from 
separating 
its 
present 
state 
from 
its 
former 
states 
" 
(7\ 
and 
F. 
W., 
p. 
ioo). 
It 
forms 
the 
past 
and 
the 
present 
into 
one 
organic 
whole, 
where 
there 
is 
mutual 
penetration, 
succession 
without 
distinction 
(ib.). 
" 
Within 
our 
ego, 
there 
is 
succession 
without 
mutual 
externality 
; 
outside 
the 
ego, 
in 
pure 
space, 
there 
is 
mutual 
externality 
without 
succession 
" 
(p. 
108). 


" 
Questions 
relating 
to 
subject 
and 
object, 
to 
their 
distinction 
and 
their 
union, 
should 
be 
put 
in 
terms 
of 
time 
rather 
than 
of 
space 
" 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
77). 
In 
the 
duration 
in 
which 
we 
see 
ourselves 
acting, 
there 
are 
dissociated 
elements 
; 
but 
in 
the 
duration 
in 
which 
we 
act, 
our 
states 
melt 
into 
each 
other 


(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
243). 
Pure 
duration 
is 
what 
is 
most 
removed 
from 
externality 
and 
least 
penetrated 
with 
externality, 
a 
duration 
in 
which 
the 
past 
is 
big 
with 
a 
present 
absolutely 
new. 
But 
then 
our 
will 
is 
strained 
to 
the 
utmost 
; 
we 
have 
to 
gather 
up 
the 
past 
which 
is 
slipping 
away, 
and 
thrust 
it 
whole 
and 

undivided 
into 
the 
present. 
At 
such 
moments 
we 
truly 
possess 
ourselves, 
but 
such 
moments 
are 
rare 
(C. 
E., 
pp. 
210-211). 
Duration 
is 
the 
very 
stuff 
of 
reality, 
which 
is 
perpetual 
becoming, 
never 
something 
made 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
287). 


It 
is 
above 
all 
in 
memory 
that 
duration 
exhibits 
itself, 
for 
in 
memory 
the 
past 
survives 
in 
the 
present. 
Thus 
the 
theory 
of 
memory 
becomes 
of 
great 
importance 
in 
Bergson's 
philosophy. 
Matter 
and 
Memory 
is 
concerned 
to 
show 
the 
relation 
of 
mind 
and 
matter, 
of 
which 
both 
are 
affirmed 
to 
be 
real 


(p. 
vii), 
by 
an 
analysis 
of 
memory, 
which 
is 
" 
just 
the 
intersection 
of 
mind 
and 
matter 
" 
(p. 
xii). 
There 
are, 
to 
begin 
with, 
two 
radically 
different 
things, 
both 
of 
which 
are 
commonly 
called 
memory 
; 
the 
clear 
distinction 
between 
these 
two 
is 
one 
of 
the 
best 
things 
in 
Bergson. 
" 
The 
past 
survives," 
he 
says, 
" 
under 
two 
distinct 
forms: 


first, 
in 
motor 
mechanisms 
; 
secondly, 
in 
independent 
recollections 
" 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
87). 
For 
example, 
a 
man 
is 
said 
to 
remember 
a 
poem 
if 
he 
can 
repeat 
it 
by 
heart, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
if 
he 
has 
acquired 
a 
certain 
habit 
or 
mechanism 
enabling 
him 
to 
repeat 
a 
former 
action. 
But 
he 
might, 
at 
least 
theoretically, 
be 
able 
to 
repeat 
the 
poem 
without 
any 
recollection 
of 
the 
previous 
occasions 
on 
which 
he 
has 
read 
it; 
thus 
there 
is 
no 
consciousness 
of 
past 
events 
involved 
in 
this 
sort 
of 
memory. 
The 
second 
sort, 
which 
alone 
really 
deserves 
to 
be 
called 
memory, 
is 
exhibited 
in 
recollections 
of 
separate 
occasions 
when 
he 
has 
read 
the 
poem, 
each 
unique 
and 
with 
a 
date. 
Here 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
habit, 
since 
each 
event 
only 
occurred 
once, 
and 
had 
to 
make 
its 
impression 
immediately. 
It 
is 
suggested 
that 
in 
some 
way 
everything 
that 
has 
happened 
to 
us 
is 
remembered, 
but 
as 
a 
rule, 
only 
what 
is 
useful 
comes 
into 
consciousness. 
Apparent 
failures 
of 
memory, 
it 
is 
argued, 
are 
not 
really 
failures 
of 
the 
mental 
part 
of 
memory, 
but 
of 
the 
motor 
mechanism 
for 
bringing 
memory 
into 
action. 
This 
view 
is 
supported 
by 
a 
discussion 
of 
brain 
physiology 
and 
the 
facts 
of 
amnesia, 
from 
which 
it 
is 
held 
to 
result 
that 
true 
memory 
is 
not 
a 
function 
of 
the 
brain 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
315). 
The 
past 
must 
be 
acted 
by 
matter, 
imagined 
by 
mind 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
298). 
Memory 
is 
not 
an 
emanation 
of 
matter 
; 
indeed 
the 
contrary 
would 
be 
nearer 
the 
truth 
if 
we 
mean 
matter 
as 
grasped 
in 
concrete 
perception, 
which 
always 
occupies 
a 
certain 
duration 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
237). 


" 
Memory 
must 
be, 
in 
principle, 
a 
power 
absolutely 
independent 
of 
matter. 
If, 
then, 
spirit 
is 
a 
reality, 
it 
is 
here, 
in 
the 
phenomena 
of 
memory, 
that 
we 
may 
come 
into 
touch 
with 
it 
experimentally 
" 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
81). 



At 
the 
opposite 
end 
from 
pure 
memory 
Bergson 
places 
pure 
perception, 
in 
regard 
to 
which 
he 
adopts 
an 
ultra-realist 
position. 
" 
In 
pure 
perception," 
he 
says, 
" 
we 
are 
actually 
placed 
outside 
ourselves, 
we 
touch 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
object 
in 
an 
immediate 
intuition 
" 
(p. 
84). 
So 
completely 
does 
he 
identify 
perception 
with 
its 
object 
that 
he 
almost 
refuses 
to 
call 
it 
mental 
at 
all. 
" 
Pure 
perception," 
he 
says, 
" 
which 


is 
the 
lowest 
degree 
of 
mind—mind 
without 
memory—is 
really 
part 
of 
matter, 
as 
we 
understand 
matter 
" 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
297). 
Pure 
perception 
is 
constituted 
by 
dawning 
action, 
its 
actuality 
lies 
in 
its 
activity 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
74). 
It 
is 
in 
this 
way 
that 
the 
brain 
becomes 
relevant 
to 
perception, 
for 
the 
brain 
is 
not 
an 
instrument 
of 
representation, 
but 
an 
instrument 
of 
action 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
83). 
The 
function 
of 
the 
brain 
is 
to 
limit 
our 
mental 
life 
to 
what 
is 
practically 
useful. 
But 
for 
the 
brain, 
one 
gathers, 
everything 
would 
be 
perceived, 
but 
in 
fact 
we 
only 
perceive 
what 
interests 
us 
(cf. 
M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
34). 
" 
The 
body, 
always 
turned 
towards 
action, 
has 
for 
its 
essential 
function 
to 
limit, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
action, 
the 
life 
of 
the 
spirit 
" 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
233). 
It 
is, 
in 
fact, 
an 
instrument 
of 
choice. 


We 
must 
now 
return 
to 
the 
subject 
of 
instinct 
or 
intuition, 
as 
opposed 
to 
intellect. 
It 
was 
necessary 
first 
to 
give 
some 
account 
of 
duration 
and 
memory, 
since 
Bergson's 
theories 
of 
duration 
and 
memory 
are 
presupposed 
in 
his 
account 
of 
intuition. 
In 
man, 
as 
he 
now 
exists, 
intuition 
is 
the 
fringe 
or 
penumbra 
of 
intellect 
: 
it 
has 
been 
thrust 
out 
of 
the 
centre 
by 
being 
less 
useful 
in 
action 
than 
intellect, 
but 
it 
has 
deeper 
uses 
which 
make 
it 
desirable.to 
bring 
it 
back 
into 
greater 
prominence. 
Bergson 
wishes 
to 
make 
intellect 
"turn 
inwards 
on 
itself, 
and 
awaken 
the 
potentialities 
of 
intuition 
which 
still 
slumber 
within 
it 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
192). 
The 
relation 
between 
instinct 
and 
intellect 
is 
compared 
to 
that 
between 
sight 
and 
touch. 
Intellect, 
we 
aie 
told, 
will 
not 
give 
knowledge 
of 
things 
at 
a 
distance 
; 
indeed 
the 
function 
of 
science 
is 
said 
to 
be 
to 
explain 
all 
peiceptions 
in 
terms 
of 
touch. 


" 
Instinct 
alone," 
he 
says, 
" 
is 
knowledge 
at 
a 
distance. 
It 
has 
the 
same 
relation 
to 
intelligence 
that 
vision 
has 
to 
touch 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
177). 
We 
may 
observe 
in 
passing 
that, 
as 
appears 
in 
many 
passages, 
Bergson 
is 
a 
strong 
visualiser, 
whose 
thought 
is 
always 
conducted 
by 
means 
of 
visual 
images. 
Many 
things 
which 
he 
declaies 
to 
be 
necessities 
of 
all 
thought 
are, 
I 
believe, 
characteristic 
of 
visualisers, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
true 
of 
those 
who 
think 
by 
means 
of 
auditory 
images. 
He 


always 
exalts 
the 
sense 
of 
sight 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
other 
senses, 
and 
his 



views 
on 
space 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
largely 
determined 
by 
this 
fact. 
I 
shall 
return 
to 
this 
question 
at 
a 
later 
stage. 


The 
essential 
characteristic 
of 
intuition 
is 
that 
it 
does 
not 
divide 
the 
world 
into 
separate 
things, 
as 
the 
intellect 
does 
; 
although 
Bergson 
does 
not 
use 
these 
words, 
we 
might 
describe 
it 
as 
synthetic 
rather 
than 
analytic. 
It 
apprehends 
a 
multiplicity, 
but 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
interpenetrating 
processes, 
not 
of 
spatially 
external 
bodies. 
There 
are 
in 
truth 
no 
things 
: 
I" 
things 
and 
states 
are 
only 
views, 
taken 
by 
our 
mind, 
of 
becoming. 
There 
are 
no 
things, 
there 
are 
only 
actions 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
261). 
This 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
which 
appears 
difficult 
and 
unnatural 
to 
intellect, 
is 
easy 
and 
natural 
to 
intuition. 
Memory 
affords 
an 
instance 
of 
what 
is 
meant, 
for 
in 
memory 
the 
past 
lives 
on 
into 
the 
present 
and 
intei 
penetrates 
it. 
Apart 
from 
mind*'The 
world 
would* 
be 
perpetually 
dying 
and 
being 
born 
again 
; 
the 
past 
would 
have 
no 
reality, 
and 
therefore 
there 
would 
be 
no 
past. 
It 
is 
memory, 
with 
its 
correlative 
desire, 
that 
makes'the 
past 
and 
the 
future 
real 
and 
therefore 
creates 
tiue 
duration)and 
true 
time. 
Intuition 
alone 
can 
understand 
this 
mingling 
of 
past 
and 
future 
: 
to 
the 
intellect 
they 
remain 
external, 
spatially 
external 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
one 
another. 
Under 
the 
guidance 
of 
intuition, 
we 
perceive 
that 
" 
form 
is 
only 
a 
snapshot 
view 
of 
a 
transition 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
319), 
and 
the 
philosopher 
" 
will 
see 
the 
material 
world 
melt 
back 
into 
a 
single 
flux 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
390). 


Closely 
connected 
with 
the 
merits 
of 
intuition 
is 
Bergson's 
doctrine 
of 
freedom 
and 
his 
praise 
of 
action. 
" 
In 
reality," 
he 
says, 
" 
a 
living 
being 
is 
a 
centre 
of 
action. 
It 
represents 
a 
certain 
sum 
of 
contingency 
entering 
into 
the 
world, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
a 
certain 
quantity 
of 
possible 
action 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
276). 
The 
arguments 
against 
free 
will 
depend 
partly 
upon 
assuming 
that 
the 
intensity 
of 
psychical 
states 
is 
a 
quantity, 
capable, 
at 
least 
in 
theory, 
of 
numerical 
measurement 
; 
this 
view 
Bergson 
undertakes 
to 
refute 
in 
the 
first 
chapter 
of 
Time 
and 
Free 
Will. 
Partly 
the 
determinist 
depends, 
we 
are 
told, 
upon 
a 
confusion 


between 
true 
duration 
and 
mathematical 
time, 
which 
Bergson 
regards 
as 
really 
a 
form 
of 
space. 
Partly, 
again, 
the 
deter-minist 
rests 
his 
case 
upon 
the 
unwarranted 
assumption 
that, 
when 
the 
state 
of 
the 
brain 
is 
given, 
the 
state 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
theroretically 
determinate. 
Bergson 
is 
willing 
to 
admit 
that 
the 
converse 
is 
true 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
the 
state 
of 
brain 
is 
determinate 
when 
the 
state 
of 
mind 
is 
given, 
but 
he 
regards 
the 
mind 
as 
more 
differentiated 
than 
the 
brain, 
and 
therefore 
holds 
that 
many 
different 
states 
of 
mind 
may 
correspond 
to 
one 
state 
of 
brain. 
He 
concludes 
that 
rea 
1 
freedom 
is 
possible 
: 
" 
We 
are 



free 
when 
our 
acts 
spring 
from 
our 
whole 
personality, 
when 
they 
express 
it, 
when 
they 
have 
that 
indefinable 
resemblance 
to 
it 
whicn 
one 
sometimes 
finds 
between 
the 
artist 
and 
his 
work 
" 
[T. 
and 
F. 
W., 
p. 
172). 


In 
the 
above 
outline, 
I 
have 
in 
the 
main 
endeavoured 
merely 
to 
state 
Bergson's 
views, 
without 
giving 
the 
reasons 
adduced 
by 
him 
in 
favour 
of 
their 
truth. 
This 
is 
easier 
than 
it 
would 
be 
with 
most 
philosophers, 
since 
as 
a 
rule 
he 
does 
not 
give 
reasons 
for 
his 
opinions, 
but 
relies 
on 
their 
inherent 
attractiveness, 
and 
on 
the 
charm 
of 
an 
excellent 
style. 
Like 
the 
advertisers 
of 
Oxo, 
he 
relies 
upon 
picturesque 
and 
varied 
statement, 
and 
an 
apparent 
explanation 
of 
many 
obscure 
facts. 
Analogies 
and 
similes, 
especially 
form 
a 
very 
laige 
part 
of 
the 
whole 
process 
by 
which 
he 
recommends 
his 
views 
to 
the 
reader. 
The 
number 
of 
similes 
for 
life 
to 
be 
found 
in 
his 
works 
exceeds 
the 
number 
in 
any 
poet 
known 
to 
me. 
Life, 
he 
says, 
is 
like 
a 
shell 
bursting 
into 
fragments 
which 
are 
again 
shells 
(C. 
£., 
p. 
103). 
It 
is 
like 
a 
sheaf 
(ib., 
p. 
104). 
Initially, 
it 
was 
" 
a 
tendency 
to 
accumulate 
in 
a 
reservoir, 
as 
do 
especially 
the 
green 
parts 
of 
vegetables 
" 
(ib., 
p. 
260). 
But 
the 
reservoir 
is 
to 
be 
filled 
with 
boUing 
water 
from 
which 
steam 
is 
issuing 
; 
"jets 
must 
be 
gushing 
out 
unceasingly., 
of 
which 
each, 
falling 
back, 
is 
a 
woild 
" 
(ib., 
p. 
261). 
Again, 
" 
life 
appears 
in 
its 
entirety 
as 
an 
immense 
wave 
which, 
starting 
from 
a 
centre, 
spreads 
outwards, 
and 
which 
on 
almost 
the 
whole 
of 
its 
circumfei 
ence 
is 
stopped 
and 
converted 
into 
oscillation 
: 
at 
one 
single 
point 
the 
obstacle 
has 
been 
forced, 


the 
impulsion 
has 
passed 
freely 
" 
(ib., 
p. 
280). 
Then 
there 
is 
the 
great 
climax 
in 
which 
life 
is 
compaied 
to 
a 
cavalry 
charge. 
" 
All 
organised 
beings, 
fiom 
the 
humblest 
to 
the 
highest, 
from 
the 
first 
origins 
of 
life 
to 
the 
time 
in 
which 
we 
are, 
and 
in 
all 
places 
as 
in 
aU 
times, 
do 
but 
evidence 
a 
single 
impulsion, 
the 
inverse 
of 
the 
movement 
of 
matter, 
and 
in 
itself 
indivisible. 
All 
the 
living 
hold 
together, 
and 
all 
yield 
to 
the 
same 
tremendous 
push. 
The 
animal 
takes 
its 
stand 
on 
the 
plant, 
man 
best 
rides 
animality, 
and 
the 
whole 
of 
humanity, 
in 
space 
and 
in 
time, 
is 
one 
immense 
army 
galloping 
beside 
and 
before 
and 
behind 
each 
of 
us 
in 
an 
overwhelming 
charge 
able 
to 
beat 
down 
every 
resistance 
and 
to 
clear 
many 
obstacles, 
perhaps 
even 
death 
" 
(C. 
E., 
pp. 
285-6). 


But 
a 
cool 
critic, 
who 
feels 
himself 
a 
mere 
spectator, 
perhaps 
an 
unsympathetic 
spectator, 
of 
the 
charge 
in 
which 
man 
is 
mounted 
upon 
animality, 
m?y 
be 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
calm 
and 
careful 
thought 
is 
haidly 
compatible 
with 
this 
form 
of 
exercise. 
When 
he 
is 
told 
that 
thought 
is 
a 
mere 



means 
of 
action, 
the 
mere 
impulse 
to 
avoid 
obstacles 
in 
the 
field, 
he 
may 
feel 
that 
such 
a 
view 
is 
becoming 
in 
a 
cavalry 
officer, 
but 
not 
in 
a 
philosopher, 
whose 
business, 
after 
all, 
is 
wi 
+ 
h 
thought 
: 
he 
may 
feel 
that 
in 
the 
passion 
and 
noise 
of 
violent 
motion 
there 
is 
no 
room 
for 
the 
fainter 
music 
of 
reason, 
no 
leisure 
for 
the 
disinterested 
contemplation 
in 
which 
greatness 
is 
sought, 
not 
by 
turbulence, 
but 
by 
the 
greatness 
of 
the 
universe 
wlrch 
is 
mirrored. 
In 
that 
case, 
he 
may 
be 
tempted 
to 
ask 
whether 
there 
are 
any 
reasons 
for 
accepting 
such 
a 
restless 
view 
of 
the 
world. 
And 
if 
he 
asks 
this 
question, 
he 
will 
find, 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
that 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
whatever 
for 
accepting 
this 
view, 
either 
in 
the 
universe 
or 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
M. 
Bergson. 


11. 


The 
two 
foundations 
of 
Bergson's 
philosophy, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
is 
more 
than 
an 
imaginative 
and 
poetic 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
are 
his 
doctrines 
of 
space 
and 
time. 
His 
doctrine 
of 
space 
is 
required 
for 
his 
condemnation 
of 
the 
intellect, 
and 


if 
he 
fails 
in 
his 
condemnation 
of 
the 
intellect, 
the 
intellect 
will 
succeed 
in 
its 
condemnation 
of 
him, 
for 
between 
the 
two 
it 
is 
war 
to 
the 
knife. 
His 
doctrine 
of 
time 
is 
necessary 
for 
his 
vindication 
of 
freedom, 
for 
his 
escape 
from 
what 
William 
James 
called 
a 
" 
block 
universe," 
foi 
his 
doctrine 
of 
a 
perpetual 
flux 
in 
which 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
flows, 
and 
for 
his 
whole 
account 
of 
the 
relations 
between 
mind 
and 
matter. 
It 
will 
be 
well, 
therefore, 
in 
criticism, 
to 
concentrate 
on 
these 
two 
doctrines. 
If 
they 
are 
true, 
such 
minor 
errors 
and 
inconsistencies 
as 
no 
philosopher 
escapes 
would 
not 
greatly 
matter, 
while 
if 
they 
are 
false, 
nothing 
remains 
except 
an 
imaginative 
epic, 
to 
be 
judged 
on 
esthetic 
rather 
than 
on 
intellectual 
grounds. 
I 
shall 
begin 
with 
the 
theory 
of 
space, 
as 
being 
the 
simpler 
of 
the 
two. 


Bergson's 
theory 
of 
space 
occurs 
fully 
and 
explicitly 
in 
his 
Time 
and 
Free 
Will, 
and 
therefore 
belongs 
to 
the 
oldest 
parts 
of 
his 
philosophy. 
In 
his 
first 
chapter, 
he 
contends 
that 
greater 
and 
less 
imply 
space, 
since 
he 
regards 
the 
great 
etas 
essentially 
that 
which 
contains 
the 
less. 
He 
offers 
no 
arguments 
whatever, 
either 
good 
or 
bad, 
in 
favour 
of 
this 
view 
; 
he 
merely 
exclaims, 
as 
though 
he 
were 
giving 
an 
obvious 
reductio 
ad 
absurdum 
: 
" 
As 
if 
one 
could 
still 
speak 
of 
magnitude 
where 
there 
is 
neither 
multiplicity 
nor 
space 
I" 
(p. 
9). 
The 
obvious 
cases 
to 
the 
contrary, 
such 
as 
pleasure 
and 
pain, 
afford 
him 
much 
difficulty, 
yet 
he 
never 
doubts 
or 
re-examines 
the 
dogma 
with 
which 
he 
starts. 


In 
his 
next 
chapter, 
he 
maintains 
the 
same 
thesis 
as 
regards 
number. 
" 
As 



soon 
as 
we 
wish 
to 
picture 
number 
to 
ourselves," 
he 
says, 
" 
and 
not 
merely 
figures 
or 
words, 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
an 
extended 
image 
" 


(p. 
78), 
and 
" 
every 
clear 
idea 
of 
number 
implies 
a 
visual 
image 
in 
space 
" 
(p. 
79). 
These 
two 
sentences 
suffice 
to 
show, 
as 
I 
shall 
try 
to 
prove, 
that 
Bergson 
does 
not 
know 
what 
number 
is, 
and 
has 
himself 
no 
clear 
idea 
of 
it. 
This 
is 
shown 
also 
by 
his 
definition 
: 
" 
Number 
may 
be 
defined 
in 
general 
as 
a 
collection 
of 
units, 
or, 
speaking 
more 
exactly, 
as 
the 
synthesis 
of 
the 
one 
and 
the 
many 
" 
(p. 
75). 
In 
discussing 
these 
statements, 
I 
must 
ask 
the 
reader's 
patience 
for 
a 
moment 
while 
I 
call 
attention 
to 
some 
distinctions 
which 
may 
at 
first 
appear 
pedantic, 
but 
are 
really 
vital. 
There 
are 
three 
entirely 
different 
things 
which 
are 
confused 
by 
Bergson 
in 
the 
above 
statements, 
namely 
: 
(i) 
number, 
the 
general 
concept 
applicable 
to 
the 
various 
particular 
numbers 
; 
(2) 
the 
various 
particular 
numbers 
; 
(3) 
the 
various 
collections 
to 
which 
the 
various 
particular 
numbers 
are 
applicable. 
It 
is 
this 
last 
that 
is 
defined 
by 
Bergson 
when 
he 
says 
that 
number 
is 
a 
collection 
of 
units. 
The 
twelve 
apostles, 
the 
twelve 
tribes 
of 
Israel, 
the 
twelve 
months, 
the 
twelve 
signs 
of 
the 
zodiac, 
are 
all 
collections 
of 
units, 
yet 
no 
one 
of 
them 
is 
the 
number 
12, 
still 
less 
is 
it 
number 
in 
general, 
as 
by 
the 
above 
definition 
it 
ought 
to 
be. 
The 
number 
12, 
obviously, 
is 
something 
which 
all 
these 
collections 
have 
in 
common 
but 
which 
they 
do 
not 
have 
in 
common 
with 
other 
collections, 
such 
as 
cricket 
elevens. 
Hence 
the 
number 
12 
is 
neither 
a 
collection 
of 
twelve 
terms, 
nor 
is 
it 
something 
which 
all 
collections 
have 
in 
common 
; 
and 
number 
in 
general 
is 
a 
property 
of 
12 
or 
11 
or 
any 
other 
number, 
but 
not 
of 
the 
various 
collections 
that 
have 
twelve 
terms 
or 
eleven 
terms. 


Hence 
when, 
following 
Bergson's 
advice, 
we 
" 
have 
recourse 
to 
an 
extended 
image 
" 
and 
picture, 
say, 
twelve 
dots 
such 
as 
are 
obtained 
by 
throwing 
double 
sixes 
at 
dice, 
we 
have 
still 
not 
obtained 
a 
picture 
of 
the 
number 
12. 
The 
number 
12, 
in 
fact, 
is 
something 
more 
abstract 
than 
any 
picture. 
Before 
we 
can 
be 
said 
to 
have 
any 
understanding 
of 
the 
number 
12, 
we 
must 
know 
what 
different 
collections 
of 
twelve 
units 
have 
in 
common, 
and 
this 
is 
something 
which 
cannot 
be 
pictured 
because 
it 
is 
abstract. 
Bergson 
only 
succeeds 
in 
making 
his 
theory 
of 
number 
plausible 
by 
confusing 
a 
particular 
collection 
with 
the 
number 
of 
its 
terms, 
and 
this 
again 
with 
number 
in 
general. 


The 
confusion 
is 
the 
same 
as 
if 
we 
confused 
a 
particular 
young 
man 
with 
youth, 
and 
youth 
with 
the 
general 
concept 
" 
period 
of 
human 
life," 
and 
were 



then 
to 
argue 
that 
because 


a 
young 
man 
has 
two 
legs, 
youth 
must 
have 
two 
legs, 
and 
the 
general 
concept 
" 
period 
of 
human 
life 
" 
must 
have 
two 
legs. 
The 
confusion 
is 
important 
because, 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
perceived, 
the 
theory 
that 
number 
or 
particular 
numbers 
can 
be 
pictured 
in 
space 
is 
seen 
to 
be 
untenable. 
This 
not 
only 
disproves 
Bergson's 
theory 
as 
to 
number, 
but 
also 
his 
more 
general 
theory 
that 
all 
abstract 
ideas 
and 
all 
logic 
are 
derived 
from 
space 
; 
for 
the 
abstract 
12, 
the 
common 
property 
of 
all 
dozens 
as 
opposed 
to 
any 
particular 
dozen, 
though 
it 
is 
never 
present 
to 
his 
mind, 
is 
obviously 
conceivable 
and 
obviously 
incapable 
of 
being 
pictured 
in 
space. 


But 
apart 
from 
the 
question 
of 
numbers, 
shall 
we 
admit 
Bergson's 
contention 
that 
every 
plurality 
of 
separate 
units 
involves 
space 
? 
Some 
of 
the 
cases 
that 
appear 
to 
contradict 
this 
view 
are 
coi 
sidered 
by 
him, 
for 
example 
successive 
sounds. 
When 
we 
hear 
the 
steps 
of 
a 
passer-by 
in 
the 
street, 
he 
says, 
we 
visualise 
his 
successive 
positions 
; 
when 
we 
hear 
the 
strokes 
of 
a 
bell, 
we 
either 
picture 
it 
swinging 
backwards 
and 
forwards, 
or 
we 
range 
the 
successive 
sounds 
in 
an 
ideal 
space 
(T. 
and 
F. 
W., 
p. 
86). 
But 
these 
are 
mere 
autobiographical 
observations 
of 
a 
visualiser, 
and 
illustrate 
the 
remark 
we 
made 
before, 
that 
Bergson's 
views 
depend 
upon 
the 
predominance 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
sight 
in 
him. 
There 
is 
no 
logical 
necessity 
to 
range 
the 
strokes 
of 
a 
clock 
in 
an 
imaginary 
space 
: 
most 
people, 
I 
imagine, 
count 
them 
without 
any 
spatial 
auxiliary. 
Yet 
no 
reason 
is 
alleged 
by 
Bergson 
for 
the 
view 
that 
space 
is 
necessary. 
He 
assumes 
this 
as 
obvious, 
and 
proceeds 
at 
once 
to 
apply 
it 
to 
the 
case 
of 
times. 
Where 
there 
seem 
to 
be 
different 
times 
outside 
each 
other, 
he 
says, 
the 
times 
aie 
pictured 
as 
spread 
out 
in 
space; 
in 
real 
time, 
such 
as 
is 
given 
by 
memory, 
different 
times 
interpenetrate 
each 
other, 
and 
cannot 
be 
counted 
because 
they 
are 
not 
separate. 


The 
view 
that 
all 
separateness 
implies 
space 
is 
now 
supposed 
estabhshed, 
and 
is 
used 
deductively 
to 
prove 
that 
space 
is 
involved 
wherever 
there 
is 
obviously 
separateness, 
however 
little 
other 
reason 
there 
may 
be 
for 
suspecting 
such 


a 
thing. 
Thus 
abstract 
ideas 
foi 
example, 
obviously 
exclude 
each 
other 
: 
whiteness 
is 
differenc 
from 
blackness, 
health 
is 
different 
from 
sickness, 
folly 
is 
different 
from 
wisdom. 
Hence 
all 
abstract 
ideas 
involve 
space 
; 
and 
therefore 
logic, 
which 
uses 
abstract 
ideas, 
is 
an 
offshot 
of 
geometry, 
and 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
intellect 
depends 
upon 
a 
supposed 
habit 
of 
picturing 
things 
side 
by 
side 
in 
space. 
This 
conclusion, 
upon 
which 
Bergson's 
whole 
condemnation 



of 
the 
intellect 
rests, 
is 
based, 
so 
far 
as 
can 
be 
discovered, 
entirely 
upon 
a 
personal 
idiosyncrasy 
mistaken 
for 
a 
necessity 
of 
thought, 
I 
mean 
the 
idiosyncrasy 
of 
visualising 
successions 
as 
spread 
out 
on 
a 
line. 
The 
instance 
of 
numbers 
shows 
that, 
if 
Bergson 
were 
in 
the 
right, 
we 
could 
never 
have 
attained 
to 
the 
abstract 
ideas 
which 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
thus 
impregnated 
with 
space 
; 
and 
conversely, 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
can 
understand 
abstract 
ideas 
(as 
opposed 
to 
particular 
things 
which 
exemplify 
them) 
seems 
sufficient 
to 
prove 
that 
he 
is 
wrong 
in 
regarding 
the 
intellect 
as 
impregnated 
with 
space. 


One 
of 
the 
bad 
effects 
of 
an 
anti-intellectual 
philosophy, 
such 
as 
that 
of 
Bergson, 
it 
that 
it 
thrives 
upon 
the 
errors 
and 
confusions 
of 
the 
intellect. 
Hence 
it 
is 
led 
to 
prefer 
bad 
thinking 
to 
good, 
to 
declare 
every 
momentary 
difficulty 
insoluble, 
and 
to 
regard 
every 
foolish 
mistake 
as 
revealing 
the 
bankruptcy 
of 
intellect 
and 
the 
triumph 
of 
intuition. 
There 
are 
in 
Bergson's 
works 
many 
allusions 
to 
mathematics 
and 
science, 
and 
to 
a 
careless 
reader 
these 
allusions 
may 
seem 
to 
strengthen 
his 
philosophy 
greatly. 
As 
regards 
science, 
especially 
biology 
and 
physiology, 
I 
am 
not 
competent 
to 
criticise 
his 
interpretations. 
But 
as 
regards 
mathematics, 
he 
has 
deliberately 
preferred 
traditional 
errors 
in 
interpretation 
to 
the 
more 
modern 
-views 
which 
have 
prevailed 
among 
mathematicians 
for 
the 
last 
half 
century. 
In 
this 
matter, 
he 
has 
followed 
the 
example 
of 
most 
philosophers. 
In 
the 
eighteenth 
and 
early 
nineteenth 
centuries, 
the 
infinitesimal 
calculus, 
though 
well 
developed 
as 
a 
method, 
was 
supported, 
as 
regards 
its 
foundations, 
by 
many 
fallacies 
and 
much 
confused 
thinking. 
Hegel 
and 
his 
followers 
seized 
upon 
these 


fallacies 
and 
confusion?, 
to 
support 
them 
in 
their 
attempt 
to 
prove 
all 
mathematics 
self-contradictory. 
Thence 
the 
Hegelian 
account 
of 
these 
matters 
passed 
into 
the 
current 
thought 
of 
philosophers, 
where 
it 
has 
remained 
long 
after 
the 
mathematicians 
have 
removed 
all 
the 
difficulties 
upon 
which 
the 
philosophers 
rely. 
And 
so 
long 
as 
the 
main 
object 
of 
philosophers 
is 
to 
show 
that 
nothing 
can 
be 
learned 
by 
patience 
and 
detailed 
thinking, 
but 
that 
we 
ought 
rather 
to 
worship 
the 
prejudices 
of 
the 
ignorant 
under 
the 
title 
of 
" 
reason 
" 
if 
we 
are 
Hegelians, 
or 
of 
" 
intuition 
" 
if 
we 
are 
Bergsonians, 
so 
long 
philosophers 
will 
take 
care 
to 
remain 
ignorant 
of 
what 
mathematicians 
have 
done 
to 
remove 
the 
errors 
by 
which 
Hegel 
profited. 


Apart 
from 
the 
question 
of 
number 
which 
we 
have 
already 
considered, 
the 
chief 
point 
at 
which 
Bergson 
touches 
mathematics 
is 
his 
rejection 
of 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
" 
cinematographic 
" 
representation 
of 
the 
world. 
Mathematics 
conceives 
change, 
even 
continuous 
change, 
as 
constituted 
by 
a 
series 
of 
states 



; 
Bergson, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
contends 
that 
no 
series 
of 
states 
can 
represent 
what 
is 
continuous, 
and 
that 
in 
change 
a 
thing 
is 
never 
in 
any 
state 
at 
all. 
This 
view 
that 
change 
is 
constituted 
by 
a 
series 
of 
changing 
states 
he 
calls 
cinematographic 
; 
this 
view, 
he 
says, 
is 
natural 
to 
the 
intellect, 
but 
is 
radically 
vicious. 
True 
change 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
by 
true 
duration 
; 
it 
involves 
an 
interpenetration 
of 
past 
and 
present, 
not 
a 
mathematical 
succession 
of 
static 
states. 
This 
is 
what 
is 
called 
a 
" 
dynamic 
" 
instead 
of 
a 
" 
static 
" 
view 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
question 
is 
important, 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
difficulty 
we 
cannot 
pass 
it 
by. 


Bergson's 
position 
is 
illustrated—and 
what 
is 
to 
be 
said 
in 
criticism 
may 
also 
be 
aptly 
illustrated—by 
Zeno's 
argument 
of 
the 
arrow. 
Zeno 
argues 
that, 
since 
the 
arrow 
at 
each 
moment 
simply 
is 
where 
it 
is, 
thereforethe 
arrow 
in 
its 
flight 
is 
always 
at 
rest. 
At 
first 
sight, 
this 
argument 
may 
not 
appear 
a 
very 
powerful 
one. 
Of 
course, 
it 
will 
be 
said, 
the 
arrow 
is 
where 
it 
is 
at 
one 
moment, 
but 
at 
another 
moment 
it 
is 
somewhere 
else, 
and 
this 
is 
just 
was 
constitutes 
motion. 


Certain 
difficulties, 
it 
is 
true, 
arise 
out 
of 
the 
continuity 
of 
motion, 
if 
we 
insist 
upon 
assuming 
that 
motion 
is 
also 
discontinuous. 
These 
difficulties, 
thus 
obtained, 
have 
long 
been 
part 
of 
the 
stock-in-trade 
of 
philosophers. 
But 
if, 
with 
the 
mathematicians, 
we 
avoid 
the 
assumption 
that 
motion 
is 
also 
discontinuous, 
we 
shall 
not 
fall 
into 
the 
philosopher's 
difficulties. 
A 
cinematograph 
in 
which 
there 
are 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
films, 
and 
in 
which 
there 
is 
never 
a 
next 
film 
because 
an 
infinite 
number 
come 
between 
any 
two, 
will 
perfectly 
represent 
a 
continuous 
motion. 
Wherein, 
then, 
lies 
the 
force 
of 
Zeno's 
argument 
? 


Zeno 
belonged 
to 
the 
Eleatic 
school, 
whose 
object 
was 
to 
prove 
that 
there 
could 
be 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
change. 
The 
natural 
view 
to 
take 
of 
the 
world 
is 
that 
there 
are 
things 
which 
change 
; 
for 
example, 
there 
is 
an 
arrow 
which 
is 
now 
here, 
now 
there. 
By 
bisection 
of 
this 
view, 
philosophers 
have 
developed 
two 
paradoxes. 
The 
Eleatics 
said 
that 
there 
were 
things 
but 
no 
changes 
; 
Heraclitus 
and 
Bergson 
said 
that 
there 
were 
changes 
but 
no 
things. 
The 
Eleatics 
said 
there 
was 
an 
arrow, 
but 
no 
flight 
; 
Heraclitus 
and 
Bergson 
said 
there 
was 
a 
flight 
but 
no 
arrow. 
Each 
party 
conducted 
its 
argument 
by 
refutation 
of 
the 
other 
party. 
How 
ridiculous 
to 
say 
there 
is 
no 
arrow 
! 
say 
the 
" 
static 
" 
party. 
How 
ridiculous 
to 
say 
there 
is 
no 
flight! 
say 
the 
" 
dynamic 
" 
party. 
The 
unfortunate 
man 
who 
stands 
in 
the 
middle 
and 
maintains 
that 
there 
is 
both 
the 
arrow 
and 
its 
flight 
is 
assumed 
by 
the 
disputants 
to 
deny 
both 
; 
he 



is 
therefore 
pierced, 
like 
St. 
Sebastian, 
by 
the 
arrow 
from 
one 
side 
and 
by 
its 
flight 
from 
the 
other. 
But 
we 
have 
still 
not 
discovered 
wherein 
lies 
the 
force 
of 
Zeno's 
argument. 


Zeno 
assumes, 
tacitly, 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
Bergsonian 
theory 
of 
change. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
he 
assumes 
that 
when 
a 
thing 
is 
in 
a 
process 
of 
continuous 
change, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
only 
change 
of 
position, 
there 
must 
be 
in 
the 
thing 
some 
internal 
state 
of 
change. 
The 
thing 
must, 
at 
each 
instant, 
be 
intrinsically 
different 
from 
what 
it 
would 
be 
if 
it 
were 
not 
changing. 
He 
then 
points 
out 
that 
at 
each 
instant 
the 
arrow 


*9 


simply 
is 
where 
it 
is, 
just 
as 
it 
would 
be 
if 
it 
were 
at 
rest. 
Hence 
he 
concludes 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
state 
of 
motion, 
and 
therefore, 
adhering 
to 
the 
view 
that 
a 
state 
of 
motion 
is 
essential 
to 
motion, 
he 
infers 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
motion 
and 
that 
the 
arrow 
is 
always 
at 
rest. 


Zeno's 
argument, 
therefore, 
though 
it 
does 
not 
touch 
the 
mathematical 
account 
of 
change, 
does, 
prima 
facie, 
refute 
a 
view 
of 
change 
which 
is 
not 
unlike 
M. 
Bergson's. 
How, 
then, 
does 
M. 
Bergson 
meet 
Zeno's 
argument 
? 
He 
meets 
it 
by 
denying 
that 
the 
arrow 
is 
ever 
anywhere. 
After 
stating 
Zeno's 
argument, 
he 
replies 
: 
" 
Yes, 
if 
we 
suppose 
that 
the 
arrow 
can 
ever 
be 
in 
a 
point 
of 
its 
course. 
Yes 
again, 
if 
the 
arrow, 
which 
is 
moving, 
ever 
coincides 
with 
a 
position, 
which 
is 
motionless. 
But 
the 
arrow 
never 
is 
in 
any 
point 
of 
its 
course 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
325). 
This 
reply 
to 
Zeno, 
or 
a 
closely 
similar 
one 
concerning 
Achilles 
and 
the 
Tortoise, 
occurs 
in 
all 
his 
three 
books. 
Bergson's 
view, 
plainly, 
is 
paradoxical; 
whether 
it 
is 
possible, 
is 
a 
question 
which 
demands 
a 
discussion 
of 
his 
view 
of 
duration. 
His 
only 
argument 
in 
its 
favour 
is 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
mathematical 
view 
of 
change 
" 
implies 
the 
absurd 
proposition 
that 
movement 
is 
made 
of 
immobilitie^ 
" 
(C. 
E., 
p. 
325). 
But 
the 
apparent 
absurdity 
of 
this 
view 
is 
merely 
due 
to 
the 
verbal 
form 
in 
which 
he 
has 
stated 
it, 
and 
vanishes 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
realise 
that 
motion 
implies 
relations. 
A 
friendship, 
for 
example, 
is 
made 
out 
of 
people 
who 
are 
friends, 
but 
not 
out 
of 
friendships 
; 
a 
genealogy 
is 
made 
out 
of 
men, 
but 
not 
out 
of 
genealogies. 
So 
a 
motion 
is 
made 
out 
of 
what 
is 
moving, 
but 
not 
out 
of 
motions. 
It 
expresses 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
thing 
ma}' 
be 
in 
different 
places 
at 
different 
times, 
and 
that 
the 
places 
may 
still 
be 
different, 
however 
near 
together 
the 
times 
may 
be. 
Bergson's 
argument 
against 
the 
mathematical 
view 
of 
motion, 
therefore, 
reduces 
itself, 
in 
the 
last 
analysis, 
to 
a 
mere 
play 
upon 
words. 
And 
with 
this 
conclusion 
we 
may 
pass 
on 
to 
a 
criticism 
of 
his 
theory 
of 
duration. 



Bergson's 
theory 
of 
duration 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
his 
theory 
of 
memory. 
According 
to 
this 
theory, 
things 
remembered 


survive 
in 
memory, 
and 
thus 
interpenetrate 
present 
things 
: 
past 
and 
present 
are 
not 
mutually 
external, 
but 
are 
mingled 
in 
the 
unity 
of 
consciousness. 
Action, 
he 
says, 
is 
what 
constitutes 
being 
; 
but 
mathematical 
time 
is 
a 
mere 
passive 
receptacle, 
which 
does 
nothing 
and 
therefore 
is 
nothing 
(C. 
£"., 
p. 
41). 
The 
past, 
he 
says, 
is 
that 
which 
acts 
no 
longer, 
and 
the 
present 
is 
that 
which 
is 
acting 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
74). 
But 
in 
this 
statement, 
as 
indeed 
throughout 
his 
account 
of 
duration, 
Bergson 
is 
unconsciously 
assuming 
the 
ordinary 
mathematical 
time 
; 
without 
this, 
his 
statements 
are 
unmeaning. 
What 
is 
meant 
by 
saying 
" 
the 
past 
is 
essentially 
that 
which 
acts 
no 
longer 
" 
(his 
italics), 
except 
that 
the 
past 
is 
that 
of 
which 
the 
action 
is 
past 
? 
The 
words 
" 
no 
longer 
" 
are 
words 
expressive 
of 
the 
past; 
to 
a 
person 
who 
did 
not 
have 
the 
ordinary 
notion 
of 
the 
past 
as 
something 
outside 
the 
present, 
these 
words 
would 
have 
no 
meaning. 
Thus 
his 
definition 
is 
circular. 
What 
he 
says 
is, 
in 
effect, 
" 
the 
past 
is 
that 
of 
which 
the 
action 
is 
in 
the 
past." 
As 
a 
definition, 
this 
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
happy 
effort. 
And 
the 
same 
applies 
to 
the 
present. 
The 
present, 
we 
are 
told, 
is 
" 
thai 
which 
is 
acting 
" 
(his 
italics).* 
But 
the 
word 
" 
is 
" 
introduces 
just 
that 
idea 
of 
the 
present 
which 
was 
to 
be 
defined. 
The 
present 
is 
that 
which 
is 
acting 
as 
opposed 
to 
that 
which 
was 
acting 
or 
will 
be 
acting. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
present 
is 
that 
whose 
action 
is 
in 
the 
present, 
not 
in 
the 
past 
or 
in 
the 
future. 
Again 
the 
definition 
is 
circular. 
An 
earlier 
passage 
on 
the 
same 
page 
will 
illustrate 
the 
fallacy 
further. 
" 
That 
which 
constitutes 
our 
pure 
perception," 
he 
says, 
" 
is 
our 
dawning 
action. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
actuality 
of 
our 
perception 
thus 
lies 
in 
its 
activity, 
in 
the 
movements 
which 
prolong 
it, 
and 
not 
in 
its 
greater 
intensity 
: 
the 
past 
is 
only 
idea, 
the 
present 
is 
ideo-motor 
" 
(ib.). 
This 
passage 
makes 
it 
quite 
clear 
that, 
when 
Bergson 
speaks 
of 
the 
past, 
he 
does 
not 
mean 
the 
past, 


* 
Similarly 
in 
Matter 
and 
Memory 
(p. 
193) 
he 
says 
it 
is 
a 
question 
whether 
the 
past 
has 
ceased 
to 
exist, 
or 
has 
only 
ceased 
to 
be 
useful. 
The 
present, 
he 
says, 
is 
not 
that 
which 
is, 
but 
that 
which 
is 
being 
made. 
The 
words 
1 
have 
italicized 
here 
really 
involve 
the 
usual 
view 
of 
time. 
but 
our 
present 
memory 
of 
the 
past. 
The 
past 
when 
it 
existed 
was 
just 
as 
active 
as 
the 
present 
is 
now 
; 
if 
Bergson's 
account 
were 
correct, 
the 
present 
moment 
ought 
to 
be 
the 
only 
one 
in 
the 
whole 
history 
of 
the 
world 
containing 
any 
activity. 


In 
earlier 
times 
there 
were 
other 
perceptions, 
just 
as 
active, 
just 
as 
actual 



in 
their 
day, 
as 
our 
present 
perception 
; 
the 
past, 
in 
its 
day, 
was 
by 
no 
means 
only 
idea, 
but 
was 
in 
its 
intrinsic 
character 
just 
what 
the 
present 
is 
now. 
This 
real 
past, 
however, 
Bergson 
simply 
forgets 
; 
what 
he 
speaks 
of 
is 
the 
present 
idea 
of 
the 
past. 
The 
real 
past 
does 
not 
mingle 
with 
the 
present. 
Our 
memory 
of 
the 
past 
does 
of 
course 
mingle 
with 
the 
present, 
since 
it 
is 
part 
of 
it 
; 
but 
that 
is 
a 
very 
different 
thing. 


The 
whole 
of 
Bergson's 
theory 
of 
duration 
and 
time 
rests 
throughout 
on 
the 
elementary 
confusion 
between 
the 
present 
occurrence 
of 
a 
recollection 
and 
the 
past 
occurrence 
whicn 
is 
recollected. 
But 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
time 
is 
so 
familiar 
to 
us, 
the 
vicious 
circle 
involved 
in 
his 
attempt 
to 
deduce 
the 
past 
as 
what 
is 
no 
longer 
active 
would 
be 
obvious 
at 
once. 
As 
it 
is, 
what 
Bergson 
gives 
is 
an 
account 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
perception 
and 
recollection— 
both 
present 
facts—and 
what 
he 
believes 
himself 
to 
have 
given 
is 
an 
account 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
present 
and 
the 
past. 
As 
soon 
as 
this 
confusion 
is 
realised, 
his 
theory 
of 
time 
is 
seen 
to 
be 
simply 
a 
theory 
which 
omits 
time 
altogether. 


The 
confusion 
between 
present 
remembering 
and 
the 
past 
event 
remembered, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
Bergson's 
theory 
of 
time, 
is 
an 
instance 
of 
a 
more 
general 
confusion 
which, 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
vitiates 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
his 
thought, 
and 
indeed 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
the 
thought 
of 
most 
modern 
philosophers—I 
mean 
the 
confusion 
between 
an 
act 
of 
knowing 
and 
that 
which 
is 
known. 
In 
memory, 
the 
act 
of 
knowing 
is 
in 
the 
present, 
whereas 
what 
is 
known 
is 
in 
the 
past; 
thus 
by 
confusing 
them 
the 
distinction 
between 
past 
and 
present 
is 
blurred. 
In 
perception, 
the 
act 
of 
knowing 
is 
mental, 
whereas 
what 
is 
known 
is 
(at 
least 
in 
one 
sense) 
physical 
or 
material; 
thus 
by 
confusing 
the 
two, 
the 
distinction 


between 
mind 
and 
matter 
is 
blurred. 
This 
enables 
Bergson 
to 
say, 
as 
we 
saw, 
that 
" 
pure 
perception, 
which 
is 
the 
lowest 
degree 
of 
mind 
... 
is 
really 
part 
of 
matter." 
The 
act 
of 
perceiving 
is 
mind, 
while 
that 
which 
is 
perceived 
is 
(in 
one 
sense) 
matter 
; 
thus 
when 
these 
two 
are 
confused, 
the 
above 
statement 
becomes 
intelligible. 


Throughout 
Matter 
and 
Memory, 
this 
confusion 
between 
the 
act 
of 
knowing 
and 
the 
object 
known 
is 
indispensable. 
It 
is 
enshrined 
in 
the 
use 
of 
the 
word 
" 
image," 
which 
is 
explained 
at 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
the 
book.* 
He 
there 
states 
that, 
apart 
from 
philosophical 
theories, 
everything 
that 
we 
know 
consists 
of 
" 
images," 
which 
indeed 
constitute 
the 
whole 
universe. 
He 
says 
: 
" 
I 
call 
matter 
the 
aggregate 
of 
images, 
and 
perception 
of 
matter 
these 
same 



images 
referred 
to 
the 
eventual 
action 
of 
one 
particular 
image, 
my 
body 
" 
(M. 
and 
M., 
p. 
8). 
It 
will 
be 
observed 
that 
matter 
and 
the 
perception 
of 
matter, 
according 
to 
him, 
consist 
of 
the 
very 
same 
things. 
The 
brain, 
he 
says, 
is 
like 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
material 
universe, 
and 
is 
therefore 
an 
image 
if 
the 
universe 
is 
an 
image 
(p. 
9). 


Since 
the 
brain, 
which 
nobody 
sees, 
is 
not, 
in 
the 
ordinary 
sense, 
an 
image, 
we 
are 
not 
surprised 
at 
his 
saying 
that 
an 
image 
can 
be 
without 
being 
perceived 
(p. 
27) 
; 
but 
he 
explains 
later 
on 
thai;, 
as 
regards 
images, 
the 
difference 
between 
being 
and 
being 
consciously 
perceived 
is 
only 
one 
of 
degree 
(p. 
30). 
This 
is 
perhaps 
explained 
by 
another 
passage 
in 
which 
he 
says 
: 
" 
What 
can 
be 
a 
non-perceived 
material 
object, 
an 
image 
not 
imaged, 
unless 
it 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
unconscious 
mental 
state 
? 
" 
(p. 
183). 
Finally 
(p. 
304) 
he 
says 
: 
" 
That 
every 
reality 
lias 
a 
kinship, 
an 
analogy, 
in 
short 
a 
relation 
with 
consciousness—this 
is 
what 
we 
concede 
to 
idealism 
by 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
we 
term 
things 
' 
images.' 
" 
Nevertheless 
he 
attempts 
to 
allay 
our 
initial 
doubt 
by 
saying 
that 
he 
is 
begin


* 
Bergson's 
use 
of 
the 
word 
" 
image 
" 
is 
made 
clearer 
by 
a 
very 
penetrating 
analysis 
of 
Berkeley 
in 
a 
recent 
article, 
" 
L'lntuition 
Philosophique" 
(Revue 
de 
Mrtaphysique 
et 
de 
Morale, 
Nov. 
1911). 
This 
article 
displays 
very 
distinctly 
the 
profound 
influence 
of 
Berkeley 
on 
Bergson's 
thought. 
Bergson's 
"image" 
is 
practically 
Berkeley's 
" 
idea." 
ning 
at 
a 
point 
before 
any 
of 
the 
assumptions 
of 
philosophers 
have 
been 
introduced. 
" 
We 
will 
assume," 
he 
says, 
" 
for 
the 
moment 
that 
we 
know 
nothing 
of 
theories 
of 
matter 
and 
theories 
of 
spirit, 
nothing 
of 
the 
discussions 
as 
to 
the 
reahty 
or 
ideaUty 
of 
the 
external 
world. 
Here 
I 
am 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
images 
" 
(p. 
i). 
And 
in 
the 
new 
Introduction 
which 
he 
wrote 
for 
the 
English 
edition 
he 
says 
: 
" 
By 
' 
image 
' 
we 
mean 
a. 
certain 
existence 
which 
is 
more 
than 
that 
which 
the 
ideaHst 
calls 
a 
representation, 
but 
less 
than 
that 
which 
tne 
realist 
calls 
a 
thing 
—an 
existence 
placed 
halfway 
between 
the 
' 
thing 
' 
and 
the 
' 
representation 
' 
" 
(p. 
vii.). 


The 
distinction 
which 
Bergson 
has 
in 
mind 
in 
the 
above 
is 
not, 
I 
think, 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
imaging 
as 
a 
mental 
occurrence 
and 
the 
thing 
imaged 
as 
an 
object. 
He 
is 
th'nking 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
thing 
as 
it 
is 
and 
the 
thing 
as 
it 
appears, 
neither 
of 
which 
belongs 
to 
the 
subject. 
Tne 
distinction 
between 
subject 
and 
object, 
between 
the 
mind 
which 
thinks 
and 
remembers 
and 
has 
images 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
objects 
thought 
about, 
remembered, 
or 
imaged— 
this 
distinction, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
can 
see, 
is 
wholly 
absent 
from 
his 



philosophy. 
Its 
absence 
is 
his 
real 
debt 
to 
idealism; 
and 
a 
very 
unfortunate 
debt 
it 
is. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
" 
images," 
as 
we 
have 
just 
seen, 
it 
enables 
him 
first 
to 
speak 
of 
images 
as 
neutral 
between 
mind 
and 
matter, 
then 
to 
assert 
that 
the 
brain 
is 
an 
image 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
has 
never 
been 
imaged, 
then 
to 
suggest 
that 
matter 
and 
the 
perception 
of 
matter 
are 
the 
same 
tring, 
but 
that 
a 
non-perceived 
image 
(such 
as 
the 
brain) 
is 
an 
unconscious 
mental 
state 
; 
while 
finally, 
the 
use 
of 
the 
word 
" 
image," 
though 
involving 
no 
metaphysical 
theories 
whatever, 
nevertheless 
implies 
that 
every 
reality 
has 
" 
a 
kinship, 
an 
analogy, 
in 
short 
a 
relation 
" 
with 
consciousness. 


All 
these 
confusions 
are 
due 
to 
the 
initial 
confusion 
of 
subject 
and 
object. 
The 
subject—a 
thought 
or 
an 
image 
or 
a 
memory—is 
a 
present 
fact 
in 
me 
; 
the 
object 
may 
be 
the 
law 
of 
gravitation 
or 
my 
friend 
Jones 
or 
the 
o'd 
Campanile 
of 
Venice. 
The 
subject 
is 
mental 
and 
is 
here 
and 
now. 
There


fore, 
if 
subject 
and 
object 
are 
one, 
the 
object 
is 
mental 
and 
is 
here 
and 
now 
; 
my 
friend 
Jones, 
though 
he 
believes 
himself 
to 
be 
in 
South 
America 
and 
to 
exist 
on 
his 
own 
account, 
is 
really 
in 
my 
head 
and 
exists 
in 
virtue 
of 
my 
thinking 
about 
him 
; 
St. 
Mark's 
Campanile, 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
great 
size 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
ceased 
to 
exist 
ten 
years 
ago, 
still 
exists, 
and 
is 
to 
be 
found 
complete 
inside 
me. 
These 
statements 
are 
no 
travesty 
of 
Bergson's 
theories 
of 
space 
and 
time 
; 
they 
are 
merely 
an 
attempt 
to 
show 
what 
is 
the 
actual 
concrete 
meaning 
of 
those 
theories. 


The 
confusion 
of 
subject 
and 
object 
is 
not 
peculiar 
to 
Bergson, 
but 
is 
common 
to 
many 
idealists 
and 
many 
materialists. 
Many 
idealists 
say 
that 
the 
object 
is 
really 
the 
subject, 
and 
many 
materialists 
say 
that 
the 
subject 
is 
really 
the 
object. 
They 
agree 
in 
thinking 
these 
two 
statements 
very 
different, 
while 
yet 
holding 
that 
subject 
and 
object 
are 
not 
different. 
In 
this 
respect, 
we 
may 
admit, 
Bergson 
has 
merit, 
for 
he 
is 
as 
ready 
impartially 
to 
identify 
subject 
with 
object 
as 
to 
identify 
object 
with 
subject. 
As 
soon 
as 
this 
identification 
is 
rejected, 
his 
whole 
system 
collapses 
: 
first 
his 
theories 
of 
space 
and 
time, 
then 
his 
belief 
in 
real 
contingency, 
then 
his 
condemnation 
of 
intellect, 
then 
his 
account 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
mind 
and 
matter, 
and 
last 
of 
all 
his 
whole 
view 
that 
the 
universe 
contains 
no 
things, 
but 
only 
actions, 
movements, 
changes, 
from 
nothing 
to 
nothing, 
in 
an 
endless 
alternation 
of 
up 
and 
down. 


Of 
course 
a 
large 
part 
of 
Bergson's 
philosophy, 
probably 
the 
part 
to 
which 
most 
of 
its 
popularity 
is 
due, 
does 
not 
depend 
upon 
argument, 
and 
cannot 
be 
upset 
by 
argument. 
His 
imaginative 
picture 
of 
the 
world, 
regarded 
as 
a 
poetic 
effort, 
is 
in 
fne 
main 
not 
capable 
of 
either 
proof 
or 
disproof. 
Shakespeare 
says 



life's 
but 
a 
walking 
shadow, 
Shelley 
says 
it 
is 
like 
a 
dome 
of 
many 
coloured 
glass, 
Bergson 
says 
it 
is 
a 
shell 
which 
bursts 
into 
parts 
that 
are 
again 
shells. 
If 
you 
like 
Bergson's 
image 
better, 
it 
is 
just 
as 
legitimate. 


The 
good 
which 
Bergson 
hopes 
to 
see 
realised 
in 
the 
world 
is 
action 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
action. 
All 
pure 
contemplation 


he 
calls 
" 
dreaming," 
and 
condemns 
by 
a 
whole 
seiies 
of 
uncomplimentary 
epithets 
: 
static, 
Platonic, 
mathematical, 
logical, 
intellectual. 
Those 
who 
desire 
some 
prevision 
of 
the 
end 
which 
action 
is 
to 
achieve 
are 
told 
that 
an 
end 
foieseen 
would 
be 
nothing 
new, 
because 
desire, 
like 
memory, 
is 
identified 
with 
its 
object. 
Thus 
we 
are 
condemned, 
in 
action, 
to 
be 
the 
blind 
slaves 
of 
instinct 
: 
the 
life-force 
pushes 
us 
on 
from 
behind, 
restlessly 
and 
unceasingly. 
There 
is 
no 
room 
in 
this 
philosophy 
for 
the 
moment 
of 
contemplative 
insight 
when, 
lising 
above 
the 
animal 
life, 
we 
become 
conscious 
of 
the 
greater 
ends 
that 
redeem 
man 
from 
the 
life 
of 
the 
brutes. 
Those 
to 
whom 
activity 
without 
purpose 
seems 
a 
sufficient 
good 
will 
find 
in 
Bergson's 
books 
a 
pleasing 
picture 
of 
the 
univeis 
. 
But 
those 
to 
whom 
action, 
if 
it 
is 
to 
be 
of 
any 
value, 
must 
be 
inspired 
by 
some 
vision, 
by 
some 
imaginative 
foie-shadowing 
of 
a 
world 
less 
painful, 
less 
unjust, 
less 
full 
of 
strife 
than 
the 
world 
of 
our 
e/ery-day 
fife, 
those, 
in 
a 
word, 
whose 
action 
is 
built 
on 
contemplation, 
will 
find 
in 
this 
philosophy 
nothing 
of 
what 
they 
seek, 
and 
will 
not 
regret 
that 
tnere 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
think 
it 
tiue. 


ON 
MR. 
RUSSELLS 
REASONS 
FOR 


SUPPOSING 
THAT 
BERGSON'S 


PHILOSOPHY 
IS 
NOT 
TRUE. 


BY 
H. 
WILDON 
CARR. 


In 
his 
criticism 
of 
Bergson, 
Mr. 
Russell 
begins 
by 
giving 
a 
description 
of 
Bergson's 
philosophy 
which 
presents 
the 
leading 
features 
of 
the 
doctrine, 
with 
certain 
ironical 
touches 
such 
as 
we 
expect 
from 
" 
a 
cool 
ciitic, 
who 
feels 
himself 
a 
spectator, 
perhaps 
an 
unsympathetic 
spectator," 
and 
concludes 
with 
the 
opinion 
that 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
whatever 
for 
accepting 
it, 
either 
in 
the 
universe 
or 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Mr. 
Bergson. 
Had 
Mr. 
Russell 
ended 
his 
paper 
with 
this 
negative 
conclusion, 
he 
would 
have 
thrown 
on 
the 
champion 
of 
Bergson, 
willing 
to 
take 
up 
the 
challenge, 
the 
formidable 
task 
of 
discovering 
a 
reason 
that 
would 
oblige 
the 
critic 
to 
modify 
his 
attitude, 
but 
fortunately 
in 
the 
second 
part 
of 
his 
paper 
he 
has 
given 
us 
two 
reasons 
for 
rejecting 
the 
philosophy. 
It 
is 
these 
two 
reasons 
that 
seem 
to 
me 
to 
demand 
careful 
examina 
-tion 
and 
reply. 



The 
two 
reasons 
are 
directed 
against 
the 
two 
foundations 
of 
Bergson's 
philosophy, 
the 
doctrines 
of 
space 
and 
of 
time. 
In 
singling 
out 
these 
points 
for 
nis 
attack, 
Mr. 
Russell 
has 
shown 
something 
like 
the 
anatomical 
skill 
of 
the 
paralysing 
wasp 
in 
one 
of 
Bergson's 
best 
known 
illustrations 
; 
if 
the 
argument 
gets 
home, 
it 
will 
destroy 
all 
power 
for 
harm 
the 
philosophy 
may 
have 
without 
killing 
it 
outright, 
for 
Mr. 
Russell 
is 
willing 
to 
leave 
us 
its 
poetry. 


The 
first 
argument 
is 
directed 
against 
the 
well 
known 
and 
fundamental 
doctrine 
that 
the 
intellect 
is 
a 
mode 
of 
activity 
whose 
essential 
function 
is 
to 
spatialise 
reality. 
Whatever 
the 
object 
trat 
we 
apprehend 
intellectually, 
becomes 
in 
such 


intellectual 
apprehension 
an 
extended 
image. 
Mr. 
Russell 
' 
takes 
the 
particular 
instance 
of 
number 
and 
proceeds 
to 
prove 
that 
Bergson 
does 
not 
know 
what 
number 
is, 
and 
has 
himself 
no 
clear 
idea 
of 
it. 
Three 
entirely 
different 
things 
are 
confused, 
he 
tells 
us, 
in 
Bergson's 
account, 
namely, 
(i) 
number. 
the 
general 
concept 
applicable 
to 
the 
various 
particular 
numbers, 
(2) 
the 
various 
particular 
numbers 
and 
(3) 
the 
various 
collections 
to 
which 
the 
various 
particular 
numbers 
are 
applicable. 
When, 
therefore, 
Bergson 
says 
that 
" 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
wish 
to 
picture 
number 
to 
ourselves 
and 
not 
merely 
figures 
01 
words, 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
an 
extended 
image," 
this 
can 
only 
refer 
to 
meaning 
(3) 
and 
to 
assert 
it 
of 
(1) 
or 
(2) 
shows 
a 
failure 
to 
appreciate 
a 
vital 
distinction. 


Before 
I 
attempt 
to 
reply 
to 
this 
argument, 
let 
me 
clear 
the 
ground 
by 
examining 
a 
suggested 
explanation 
that 
Mr. 
Russell 
offers 
of 
the 
reason 
why 
Bergson 
may 
have 
failed 
to 
understand 
this 
distinction, 
a 
reason 
of 
a 
personal 
and 
psychological 
nature, 
namely, 
that 
Bergson 
is 
a 
visualizer. 
Mr. 
Russell 
makes 
a 
great 
point 
of 
this. 
He 
suggests 
it 
first 
of 
all 
in 
his 
general 
survey 
and 
then 
returns 
to 
it 
as 
something 
illustrate 
1 
and 
demonstrated 
by 
this 
very 
case 
in 
point. 
When 
Mr. 
Russell 
says 
that 
Bergson 
is 
a 
visualizer 
he 
seems, 
indeed, 
to 
suggest 
that 
to 
be 
a 
visualizer 
is 
to 
suffer 
from 
a 
defect 
which 
distinctly 
handicaps 
the 
patient. 
We 
may 
be 
quite 
sure 
that 
Mr. 
Russell 
intends 
nothing 
of 
the 
kind 
if 
he 
did 
we 
should 
be 
driven 
to 
suppose 
that 
he 
consideied 
the 
only 
pei 
son 
capable 
of 
pure 
appreciation 
of 
philosophical 
distinctions 
is 
the 
man 
blind 
from 
his 
birth. 
Psychologists 
divide 
us 
all, 
I 
believe, 
according 
to 
the 
prevailing 
character 
of 
our 
mental 
imagery, 
according 
to 
whether 
it 
is 
prevailingly 
visual, 
auditory 
or 
motor, 
and 
it 
is 
found 
that 
we 
diffei 
from 
one 
another 
very 
considerably 
in 
this 
respect, 
but 
I 
do 
not 
know 
that 
it 
has 
ever 
been 
alleged 
that 
one 
form 
of 
imagery 
rather 
than 



another 
either 
gives 
an 
intellectual 
advantage 
or 
constitutes 
an 
intellectual 
defect. 
But 
whether 
that 
is 
so 
or 
no', 
anyone 
who 
has 
the 
psychological 
habit 
of 
introspection 
can 


test 
for 
himself 
the 
prevailing 
character 
of 
his 
imagery 
and 
so 
can 
know 
whether 
he 
is 
or 
is 
not 
a 
visualizer, 
and 
if 
that 
is 
so 
I 
can 
settle 
the 
question 
finally 
so 
far 
as 
Bergson 
is 
concerned, 
for 
I 
have 
learnt 
on 
his 
own 
authority 
that 
he 
is 
not. 


Of 
the 
meanings 
of 
number, 
Mr. 
Russell 
allows 
that 
Bergson's 
doctrine 
that 
intellectual 
apprehension 
compels 
us 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
an 
extended 
image 
is 
true 
of 
meaning 
(3) 
but 
denies 
tnat 
it 
is 
true 
of 
meanings 
(1) 
and 
(2). 
Here 
then 
is 
a 
clear 
issue. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
Bergson 
himself 
in 
the 
sentence 
criticised 
makes 
a 
distinction 
" 
As 
soon 
as 
we 
wish 
to 
picture 
number 
and 
not 
merely 
figures 
or 
words." 
The 
italics 
are 
Bergson's. 
This 
is 
important 
because 
it 
admits 
that 
we 
can, 
and 
ordinarily 
do, 
apprehend 
meanings 
by 
figures 
or 
wor 
is 
and 
these 
do 
not 
compel 
recourse 
to 
an 
extended 
image. 
" 
It 
is 
the 
clear 
idea 
of 
number 
that 
implies 
a 
visual 
image 
in 
space." 
It 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
me 
material 
to 
the 
argument 
that 
the 
image 
should 
be 
visual 
as 
distinct 
from 
auditory 
or 
motor, 
the 
essential 
thing 
is 
that 
it 
is 
spatial. 
It 
should 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
Bergson 
uses 
the 
word 
image 
for 
what 
Mr. 
Russell 
calls 
a 
sense 
datum 
and 
other 
pnilosophers 
a 
presentation 
; 
and 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
disadvantage 
of 
Bergson's 
term 
is 
that 
it 
suggests 
something 
exclusively 
visual. 
Now 
Mr. 
Russell 
has 
arranged 
his 
three 
meanings 
in 
a 
certain 
order,—is 
this 
oider 
also 
an 
order 
of 
knowing 
? 
To 
be 
more 
precise, 
does 
Mr. 
Russell 
hold 
that 
we 
can 
be 
acquainted 
with 
meaning 


(1) 
while 
totally 
unacquainted 
with 
meaning 
(2) 
? 
and 
meaning 
(2) 
while 
unacquainted 
with 
meaning 
(3). 
Let 
us 
see. 
Mr. 
Russell 
holds 
tnat 
we 
know 
universals 
and 
sense 
data 
by 
acquaintance, 
and 
also 
that 
the 
universal 
is 
an 
object 
of 
knowledge 
quite 
distinct 
from 
particular 
instances. 
Thus 
the 
number 
12 
is 
a 
universal 
known 
by 
acquaintance, 
it 
is 
applicable 
to 
various 
particular 
instances, 
the 
twelve 
apostles, 
twelve 
tribes 
of 
Israel, 
&c, 
none 
of 
which 
instances 
is 
the 
number 
12, 
but 
the 
number 
12 
is 
something 
common 
to 
all 
the 
instances, 
whether 
these 
are 
known 
or 
unknown, 
actual 
or 
possible, 
existent 
or 
non-existent. 
Suppose 
this 
granted, 
can 
we 
apprehend 
the 
number 
12 
if 
we 
have 
never 
had 
acquaintance 
with 
any 
particular 
instance 
of 
12 
units 
? 
Cleatly 
Mr. 
Russell's 
definition 
shows 
that 
this 
is 
impossible, 
and 
that 
there 
can 
only 
be 
acquaintance 
with 
a 
universal 
if 
there 
has 
already 
been 



acquaintance 
with 
sense 
data 
which 
are 
particular, 
for 
how 
does 
he 
define 
the 
number 
12 
? 
" 
The 
number 
12, 
obviously," 
he 
says, 
" 
is 
something 
which 
all 
these 
collections 
of 
12 
units 
have 
in 
common." 
Suppose 
then 
I 
am 
not 
acquainted 
with 
any 
collection 
of 
12 
units 
clearly 
I 
cannot 
be 
acquainted 
with 
that 
which 
is 
common 
to 
all 
collections 
of 
12 
units 
? 
Granting 
then 
that 
the 
universal, 
the 
number 
12, 
is 
a 
distinct 
object 
of 
the 
nund, 
known 
by 
acquaintance, 
how 
can 
its 
meaning 
be 
apprehended 
except 
as 
" 
a 
synthesis 
of 
the 
one 
and 
many," 
and 
how 
can 
a 
synthesis 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
mind 
except 
by 
recouise 
to 
an 
extended 
image 
? 
But, 
says 
Mr. 
Russell, 
" 
we 
cannot 
picture 
the 
number 
12 
because 
it 
is 
something 
more 
abstract 
than 
any 
picture." 
No 
doubt, 
but 
to 
admit 
that 
it 
is 
more 
abstract 
than 
any 
picture 
is 
not 
to 
prove 
that 
we 
apprenend 
it 
without 
recourse 
to 
an 
extended 
image. 
Let 
us 
grant 
that 
the 
abstract 
12 
"is 
obviously 
conceivable 
and 
obviously 
incapable 
of 
being 
pictured 
in 
space," 
we 
have 
still 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
this 
abstract 
12 
is 
" 
what 
different 
collections 
of 
12 
units 
have 
in 
common." 
We 
may 
not 
picture 
the 
abstract 
12 
but 
we 
are 
dependent 
on 
an 
extended 
image 
for 
our 
apprehension 
of 
its 
meaning. 
Unless 
therefore 
Mr. 
Russell 
holds 
that, 
like 
Condillac's 
statue 
with 
no 
sense 
but 
that 
of 
smell, 
there 
might 
exist 
a 
mind 
with 
no 
object 
present 
to 
it 
but 
the 
abstract 
12, 
I 
for 
one 
see 
no 
reason 
in 
his 
argument 
for 
supposing 
Bergson's 
doctrine 
not 
true. 


In 
close 
connection 
with 
this 
argument 
Mr. 
Russell 
charges 
Bergson 
with 
neglect 
of 
the 
modern 
views 
of 
mathematics. 
" 
He 
deliberately," 
he 
says, 
" 
preferred 
traditional 
errors 
in 
interpretation 
to 
the 
more 
modern 
views 
which 
have 
prevailed 
among 
mathematicians 
for 
the 
last 
half 
century." 
Now 
I 
am 
not 
qualified, 
and 
therefore 
shall 
not 
presume 
to 


discuss 
mathematical 
theories 
with 
Mr. 
Russell. 
I 
go 
to 
him 
to 
learn 
not 
to 
criticise. 
I 
will 
look 
at 
this 
charge 
therefore 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
a 
disinterested 
spectator. 


The 
case 
in 
point 
is 
Bergson's 
solution 
of 
Zeno's 
argument 
of 
the 
arrow. 
According 
to 
Mr. 
Russell, 
modern 
mathematics 
states 
the 
problem 
in 
terms 
that 
deprive 
the 
paradox 
of 
meaning, 
so 
that 
ZenoV 
problem 
no 
longer 
exists 
and 
Bergson's 
argument 
to 
meet 
it 
is 
superfluous. 
This, 
Mr. 
Russell 
admits, 
is 
Zeno's 
fault, 
not 
Bergson's, 
but 
if 
Bergson 
had 
familiarised 
himself 
with 
modern 
mathematical 
theory 
he 
would 
not 
have 
revived 
the 
ancient 
puzzle. 
Let 
us 
put 
the 
two 
solutions 
side 
by 
side. 
Bergson 
says 
that 
Zeno 
failed 
to 
see 
that 
a 
movement 
is 
indivisible, 
you 
can 
only 
divide 
it 
by 
stopping 
it, 
and 
that 
is 
destroying 
it, 
not 
dividing 
it. 
You 
think 
you 
can 
divide 
ic 
because 
you 



measure 
the 
course 
of 
the 
trajectory, 
and 
that 
being 
spatial, 
and 
therefore 
immobile, 
is 
divisible 
infinitely. 
Modern 
mathematics, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
says 
that 
continuity 
is 
infinite 
divisibility, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
if 
there 
is 
an 
infinite 
number 
between 
any 
two 
numbers 
in 
a 
series, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
no 
next 
number, 
then 
the 
series 
is 
continuous—this 
is 
all 
that 
continuity 
can 
mean. 
" 
A 
cinematograph," 
s;iys 
Mi. 
Russell, 
"in 
which 
there 
are 
an 
mfinUe 
number 
of 
films, 
and 
in 
which 
there 
is 
never 
a 
next 
film, 
because 
an 
infinite 
number 
comes 
bftween 
any 
two, 
will 
perfectly 
represent 
a 
continuous 
motion." 
Well, 
ot 


e, 
we 
musl 
admit 
that, 
if 
we 
accept 
this 
definition 
of 
i 
ratinuity 
i 
takeaway 
the 
ground 
of 
Zeno's 
argument— 
bul 
does 
it 
remove 
the 
paradox 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
movement 
? 
Tiiis 
is 
the 
kind 
ot 
difficulty 
I 
feel 
in 
regard 
to 
;ill 
Mr. 
Russell's 
work, 
he 
removes 
onep 
ily 
tole 
ive 
me 
with 
a 
greater. 


If 
I 
am 
puzzled 
to 
understand 
how 
Achilles 
can 
overtake 
the 
tortoise, 
Mr. 
Russell 
leaves 
me 
m 
doubt 
whether 
I 
can 
even 
affirm 
that 
the 
tortoise 
cannof 
overtake 
Achilles, 
[s 
there 
not 
a 
one-to-one 
relation 
between 
the 
fast 
stride 
of 
Achilles 
and 
the 
slow 
step 
of 
the 
tortoise, 
so 
that, 
granted 
infinite 
time, 
eve 
that 
Achilles 
lakes 
will 
be 
takei 


by 
ti. 


Bergson 
may 
be 
right 
or 
he 
may 
be 
wrong, 
but 
he 
offers 
a 
solution 
of 
a 
paradox, 
whereas 
Mr. 
Russell 
offers 
a 
choice 
of 
paradoxes. 
I, 
for 
one, 
can 
find 
no 
reason 
in 
modern 
views 
of 
mathematics 
for 
supposing 
the 
Bergson's 
solution 
is 
not 
true. 


I 
now 
come 
to 
the 
second 
fundamental 
position 
that 
Mr. 
Russell 
attacks, 
namely, 
Bergson's 
theory 
of 
duiaticn. 
This 
attack, 
if 
it 
succeeds, 
is 
the 
more 
deadly 
of 
the 
two. 
Here 
again 
it 
is 
a 
confusion 
of 
two 
things 
that 
are 
quite 
distinct 
that 
is 
charged 
against 
Bergson,—the 
confusion 
between 
the 
act 
of 
knowing 
and 
that 
which 
is 
known. 
If 
this 
can 
be 
brought 
home 
to 
him 
then 
Mr. 
Russell 
tells 
us 
" 
his 
whole 
system 
collapses 
: 
first 
his 
theories 
of 
space 
and 
time, 
then 
his 
belief 
in 
real 
contingency, 
then 
his 
condemnation 
of 
intellect, 
then 
his 
account 
of 
the 
relation 
of 
mind 
and 
matter, 
and, 
last 
of 
all, 
his 
whole 
view 
that 
the 
universe 
contains 
no 
things 
but 
only 
actions, 
movements, 
cha.iges 
from 
nothing 
to 
notning, 
in 
an 
endless 
alternation 
of 
up 
and 
down." 
The 
phrase 
" 
nothing 
to 
nothing 
" 
in 
this 
quotation 
ignores 
the 
important 
and 
essential 
doctrine 
whicn 
Bergson 
insists 
is 
fundamental 
to 
the 
comprehension 
of 
his 
view, 
namely, 
that 
nothing 
is 
a 
pseudo-idea. 
It 
is 
also 
rather 
curious 
that 
Mr. 
Russell 
attributes 
the 
confusion 
he 
alleges 
between 
the 



act 
of 
knowing 
and 
that 
which 
is 
known, 
in 
part 
to 
the 
profound 
influence 
of 
Berkeley 
01 
Bergson's 
thought, 
whereas, 
Dr. 
Dawes 
Hicks, 
who 
has 
made 
the 
same 
criticism 
of 
Bergson, 
insists 
that 
this 
veiy 
distinction 
is 
clearly 
remarked 
by 
Berkeley 
and 
essential 
to 
the 
Berkeleyan 
view. 
This 
however 
by 
the 
way, 
our 
concern 
is 
to 
know 
if 
Mr. 
Russell's 
charge 
is 
true. 
I 
think 
the 
criticism 
simply 
rests 
on 
a 
failure 
to 
appreciate 
the 
exact 
problem 
that 
Bergson 
is 
dealing 
with 
in 
his 
doctrine 
of 
duration. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
that 
Bergson 
has 
anywhere 
distinctly 
approached 
the 
problem 
of 
knowledge 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
what 
Meinong 
calls 
Gegensiandstheorie. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
hr 
view 
on 
that 
problem 
would 
be 
if 
he 
did 
give 
attention 
to 
ic, 
but 
I 
cannot 
see 
its 
relevance 
to 
the 
actual 
doctrine 
of 
duration. 
The 
distinction 
between 
the 


act 
of 
knowing 
and 
that 
which 
is 
known 
is 
surely 
implicit, 
if 
it 
is 
not 
explicit, 
in 
all 
that 
Bergson 
has 
said 
of 
intellectual 
knowledge. 
Has 
not 
Mr. 
Russell 
himself 
called 
our 
attention 
in 
this 
paper 
to 
Bergson's 
ultra-realist 
position 
in 
regard 
to 
perception 
? 
How 
is 
a 
confusion 
between 
subject 
and 
object 
consistent 
with 
any 
realist 
theory 
? 
It 
can 
only 
be 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
knowledge 
that 
Bergson 
calls 
intuition 
that 
this 
charge 
of 
confusion 
can 
have 
any 
semblance 
of 
meaning, 
and 
there 
so 
far 
from 
the 
identity 
of 
subject 
and 
object 
being 
a 
confusion 
it 
is 
of 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
the 
doctrine. 
Mr. 
Russell 
is 
perfectly 
entitled 
to 
question 
or 
deny 
that 
we 
can 
have 
knowledge 
by 
intuition, 
but 
if 
there 
is 
such 
knowledge 
it 
is 
characterised 
by 
just 
this 
fact 
that 
it 
is 
consciousness 
of 
life 
in 
living. 
The 
act 
of 
knowing 
turns 
inwards, 
itself 
knows 
its 
knowing. 
Now 
we 
are 
all 
ready 
to 
admit 
that 
such 
knowledge 
is 
rare 
and 
very 
difficult, 
and 
Mr. 
Russell 
may 
be 
right 
if 
he 
holds 
that 
it 
is 
not 
merely 
difficult 
but 
impossible, 
but 
he 
has 
no 
right 
to 
charge 
Bergson 
with 
confusing 
two 
things 
which 
if 
this 
knowledge 
exists 
are 
identical, 
namely, 
tne 
act 
of 
knowing 
and 
that 
which 
is 
known. 


As 
I 
am 
one 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
not 
the 
poetry 
but 
only 
the 
metaphysics 
of 
Bergson 
makes 
appeal, 
I 
am 
glad 
that 
I 
do 
not 
find 
in 
either 
of 
Mr. 
Russell's 
reasons 
a 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
this 
philosophy 
is 
not 
true. 


MR. 
WILDON 
CARRS 
DEFENCE 
OF 
BERGSON. 


BY 
THE 
HON. 
BERTRAND 
RUSSELL. 


At 
the 
outset, 
it 
seems 
necessary 
to 
clear 
up 
a 
misconception 
of 
my 
purpose. 
I 
did 
not 
attempt 
to 
prove 
that 
" 
Bergson's 
pnilosophy 
is 
not 
true," 
if 
we 
mean 
by 
h's 
philosophy 
the 
conclusions 
at 
which 
he 
arrives 
rather 
than 
the 
reasons 
which 
he 
gives 
for 
them. 
The 
conclusion 
of 
the 
first 
part 
of 
my 
paper, 



quoted 
by 
Mr. 
Carr, 
is 
that 
" 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
whatever 
for 
accepting 
this 
view 
" 
; 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
second 
part 
is 
almost 
verbally 
the 
same, 
namely 
" 
that 
tnere 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
think 
it 
true." 
These 
phrases 
were 
intentional. 
M. 
Bergson's 
philosophy, 
like 
all 
othei 
ambitious 
systems, 
is 
supported 
by 
arguments 
which 
I 
believe 
to 
be 
fallacious, 
but 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
false. 
I 
hold 
that 
much 
less 
can 
be 
known 
about 
the 
universe 
as 
a 
whole 
than 
many 
philosophers 
are 
inclined 
to 
suppose 
; 
I 
should 
not 
therefore 
assert 
dogmatically 
that 
the 
universe 
is 
other 
than 
it 
is 
said 
to 
be 
in 
this 
or 
that 
system, 
unless 
the 
account 
in 
question 
appeared 
self-contradictory. 
What 
I 
do 
maintain 
is 
that, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
mistakes 
in 
Bergson's 
reasoning, 
bis 
conclusions 
remain 
mere 
imaginative 
possibilities 
to 
be 
placed 
alongside 
of 
the 
thousand 
other 
possibilities 
invented 
by 
cosmic 
poets. 


Mr. 
Carr, 
however, 
in 
spite 
of 
an 
apparent 
concession 
in 
in 
his 
first 
paragraph, 
proceeds 
to 
defend 
Bergson's 
arguments 
; 
and 
we 
must 
therefore 
proceed 
to 
examine 
his 
defence. 
In 
supposing 
Bergson 
to 
be 
a 
visualizer, 
it 
appears 
1 
was 
mistaken, 
but 
the 
important 
point 
remains, 
that 
h 
; 
s 
speculation 
is 


dominated 
by 
the 
sense 
of 
sight 
to 
a 
remarkable 
pxtent, 
and 
that 
this 
seems 
connected 
with 
the 
importance 
which 
he 
assigns 
to 
space. 


Mr. 
Carr 
next 
considers 
the 
distinction 
which 
I 
emphasize 
between 
(i) 
the 
general 
concept 
Number, 
(2) 
the 
particular 
numbers, 
(3) 
the 
various 
collections 
to 
which 
numbers 
are 
applicable. 
He 
says 
I 
allow 
" 
that 
Bergson's 
doctrine 
that 
intellectual 
apprehension 
compels 
us 
to 
have 
recourse 
to 
atr 
extended 
image 
is 
true 
of 
meaning 
(3)." 
This 
is 
a 
misunderstanding 
; 
the 
view 
in 
question 
is 
examined 
and 
rejected 
in 
the 
paragraph 
on 
p. 
15 
beginning 
" 
But 
apart 
from 
the 
question 
of 
numbers, 
shall 
we 
admit 
Bergson's 
contention 
that 
every 
plurality 
of 
separate 
units 
involves 
space 
? 
" 
Hence 
the 
inferences 
drawn 
by 
Mr. 
Carr 
from 
my 
supposed 
concession 
fall 
to 
the 
ground. 


The 
next 
question 
raised, 
as 
to 
the 
order 
in 
which 
we 
come 
to 
know 
the 
above 
three 
meanings, 
appears 
to 
me 
logically 
irrelevant, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
under 
protest 
that 
I 
am 
willing 
to 
consider 
it. 
He 
asks 
: 
" 
Can 
we 
apprehend 
the 
number 
12 
if 
we 
have 
never 
had 
acquaintance 
with 
any 
particular 
instance 
of 
12 
units 
? 
" 
He 
supposes 
that 
my 
answer 
must 
be 
in 
the 
negative, 
because 
I 
say 
that 
the 
number 
12 
is 
" 
something 
which 
all 
these 
collections 
of 
12 
units 
have 
in 
common," 
and 
he 
supposes 
that 
this 
is 
a 
definition 
of 
12. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
definition, 
and 
does 
not 
have 
the 
form 
of 
a 
definition. 
And 
I 
certainly 
hold 
that 
we 
might 
appiehend 
the 
number 
12 
without 
having 
acquaintance 
with 



any 
particular 
dozen. 
I 
have 
not, 
so 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
ever 
been 
acquainted 
with 
a 
collection 
of 
34,361 
units, 
yet 
I 
apprehend 
the 
number 
34,361. 
But 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
pursue 
this 
topic 
without 
raising 
the 
whole 
question 
of 
our 
acquaintance 
with 
universals. 


With 
regard 
to 
Zeno, 
Mr. 
Carr 
says 
that 
I 
remove 
one 
paradox 
only 
to 
leave 
him 
with 
a 
greater. 
I 
admit 
that 
this 
impression 
is 
partly 
my 
fault, 
and 
that 
I 
have 
not 
always 
been 
sufficiently 
careful 
to 
display 
my 
slavish 
adherence 
to 
common 
sense. 
But 
in 
the 
main 
the 
impiession—which 
Mr. 
Carr 
shares 
with 
many 
philosophers 
who 
have 
tried 
to 


understand 
the 
mathematical 
theory 
of 
infinity 
and 
continuity—is 
due 
to 
the 
almost 
unconscious 
drawing 
of 
fallacious 
inferences. 
For 
instance, 
if 
I 
say 
" 
no 
part 
of 
Tristram 
Shandy's 
biography 
would 
remain 
permanently 
unwritten," 
I?m 
supposed 
to 
imply 
that 
some 
day 
the 
biography 
will 
be 
finished, 
which 
is 
by 
no 
means 
implied, 
and 
in 
the 
circumstances 
supposed 
is 
plainly 
false. 
This 
applies 
to 
Mr. 
Carr's 
doubt 
whether, 
on 
my 
principles, 
the 
tortoise 
cannot 
overtake 
Achilles. 
I 
say 
that, 
if 
they 
go 
on 
for 
ever, 
every 
place 
reached 
by 
Achilles 
will 
ultimately 
be 
reached 
by 
the 
tortoise 
; 
?nd 
at 
first 
sight 
this 
seems 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
statement 
that, 
after 
Achilles 
has 
passed 
the 
tortoise, 
the 
distance 
between 
them 
will 
continually 
increase. 
But 
this 
apparent 
inconsistency 
disappears 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
matter 
is 
understood. 


With 
regard 
to 
the 
phrase 
" 
from 
nothing 
to 
nothing," 
Mr. 
Carr 
says 
I 
ignore 
Bergson's 
doctrine 
that 
" 
nothing 
" 
is 
a 
pseudo-idea. 
This 
is 
a 
misunderstanding. 
I 
hold 
just 
as 
strongly 
as 
Bergson 
(though 
for 
different 
reasons) 
that 
" 
nothing 
" 
is 
a 
pseudo-idea 
; 
I 
used 
the 
phrase, 
as 
it 
ordinarily 
would 
be 
used, 
as 
an 
abbreviation 
for 
the 
phrase 
" 
not 
from 
anything 
and 
not 
to 
anything. 


Witn 
regard 
to 
the 
confusion 
of 
subject 
and 
object 
with 
which 
I 
charge 
Bergson, 
Mi. 
Can 
says 
that 
as 
regards 
intuition 
" 
so 
far 
from 
the 
identity 
of 
subject 
and 
object 
being 
a 
confusion, 
it 
is 
of 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
the 
doctrine." 
It 
was 
precisely 
my 
contention 
that 
it 
was 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
doctrine 
; 
but 
I 
fail 
to 
see 
how 
this 
proves 
that 
it 
is 
not 
a 
confusion. 
It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
only 
one 
who 
has 
never 
clearly 
distinguished 
subject 
and 
object 
can 
accept 
Bergson's 
" 
intuition." 
In 
the 
case 
of 
memory, 
this 
seems 
particularly 
evident, 
since 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
for 
Bergson 
to 
identify 
remembering 
with 
what 
is 
remembered, 
and 
therefore 
to 
say 
that 
whatever 
is 
remembered 
still 
endures. 
To 
say 
that 
such 
identification 
is 
of 
the 
essence 
of 
nis 
doctrine 
is 
no 
defence; 
the 
only 
valid 
defence 
would 
be 
to 
show 
that 
remembering 
is 
in 
fact 
identical 



with 
what 
is 
remembered. 


In 
conclusion, 
I 
must 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
an 
element 
of 


question-begging 
in 
all 
refutations 
of 
Bergson. 
When 
we 
have 
shown 
that 
this 
or 
that 
doctrine 
is 
self-contradictory, 
we 
have 
only 
shown 
that 
it 
does 
not 
appeal 
to 
the 
intellect; 
if 
the 
intellect 
is 
in 
fact 
misleading, 
as 
Bergson 
contends, 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
employ 
it 
against 
him. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
Bergson 
continually 
employs 
it 
in 
his 
own 
defence, 
by 
advancing 
arguments 
which 
plainly 
are 
intended 
to 
be 
intellectually 
satisfying. 
But 
this 
perhaps 
is 
a 
concession 
to 
the 
unconverted 
: 
when 
his 
philosophy 
has 
triumphed, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
supposed 
that 
argument 
will 
cease, 
and 
intellect 
will 
be 
lulled 
to 
sleep 
on 
the 
heaving 
sea 
of 
intuition. 
But 
until 
that 
consummation 
the 
protests 
of 
intellect 
will 
continue.
