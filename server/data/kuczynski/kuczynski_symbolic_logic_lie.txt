 Part 1 The Lie of Symbolic Logic

 

        I used to be a professor and briefly taught symbolic logic, at a very

high level.

        I have long since stopped being a professor, since it was obviously a

total crock, but now I run a tutoring business that involves me doing other

people’s homework for them, including logic homework in a lot of cases.

        Back when I was a philosophy professor and grad student, I really

tried to see legitimacy in the discipline of formal logic and myself generated

some meaningful results in it.

        But there was always something off about it, or at least about the

people who were into it. But really what was off was it itself. And yes—the

people who were into it, they too were off in a corresponding way.

        And then just a moment ago, when I was finishing up a round of

logic homework for some poor sap, it hit me.

        What they call ‘logic’ in universities is the ultimate bureaucrat

discipline. There I was, doing utterly time-consuming and generally wasteful

exercises for some client—who, like all my clients, knew that it simply

wasn’t in his interest to jump through more bureaucratic hoops than he had

to. there I was, as I was saying, and I had just spent 30 minutes putting in a

lot of little idiot notations, along the lines of ‘modus tollens, lines 2, 5’, and

‘double negation, line 1.’ Monkey idiot fake math bullshit.

        Another thing I had done was complete some truth table-based proof

—another favorite of logic professors. xxx

        85% of what I was doing had no substance. It was purely procedural.

Purely bureaucratic. And this time I saw it with the requisite simplicity and

clarity. I looked back at the people I knew during undergraduate and graduate

school who were into ‘logic’---and they were all broken, empty husk

bureaucrats. Quasi-smart, but not actually smart. Maybe a little bit actually

smart; but what they had in the way of intelligence was more about what they

didn’t have: in other words, they lacked so much in terms of intellect—or, if

not intellect, then personality-that the only part of them that was still function

was the logic part; which, for that reason, predominated.

        They all ended up becoming cipher lawyers.

        The other thing is that the term ‘logic’ is a serious misnomer in this

context. What they call ‘logic’ in college isn’t logic. Real logic is about

organizing statement-sets in a way that exposes dependence-relations. Whatthey call ‘logic’ is about rooting through the leavings of some long gone and

only semi-successful attempt on some person’s part to organize some

statement-set. What they call ‘logic’, in other words, is the study of someone

else’s attempt to construct a particular system.

        Which is not logic. Logic is about organizing scientifically pregnant

statements sets. Once the statement set has been organized, there is nothing

for the logician to do. to be sure, there is some still work to do, but it’s for the

robots, since, by supposition, the non-robotic work has already done. And of

course, these ‘robots’ are not real robots; they are human robot-precursors:

‘bureaucrats’, in other words.

        There was a computer program designed around 20 years ago called

‘Tarski’s world’, which was an attempt to ‘automate logic.’

        It was the worst conceivable failure in the history of automation.

        It was far more difficult to learn how to use their cantankerous

software than it was to do the problems the old-fashioned way.

        And what they were automating had already been automated, since

that’s what a completed logic is: a formalization of some statement-set—a

way of arranging a statement-set in such a way that bearing-relations among

its members can be detected automatically.

        So the very idea of automating logic is absurd.

        Second, it wasn’t logic that was being automated; it was some

fragment of some specific logic, which, as it turns out, was a total bust—but

these philosophy professor kept on lingering there because they couldn’t

come up with anything else.

        And finally, and most importantly, the algorithms of which that

particular system of logic availed humanity were useless. Not in the sense

that they gave the wrong answer, but in the sense that applying them took far

heftier resources of intellect and energy than simply solving the target-

problems directly.

        Plus, they only apply to artifacts, and the process of converting a

statement-set into the requisitely artificial form is far more involved

intellectually than whatever it is one supposedly figures out by using the

algorithms in question.

        Try using truth-tables to evaluate some actual argument. It’s not

worth it. It’s easier to do it by ‘long-hand’, so to speak. Plus, on the rare

occasions that truth-tables can be applied, what they tell you is mickey

mouse; and by using them, you will simply divert your attention from mattersof substance.

        Which is the very definition of mathematical failure. If an algorithm

makes it harder to solve the problems that it solves, then there is no use for it.

It is mathematical garbage.

        The discipline stuck around partly a bunch of pencil pushing geeks

posing as thinkers were in their comfort zone with it, because it’s not a real

discipline; it’s just bureaucrat-geek protocols masquerading as one.

        NOTE: In the following homework assignment (the one just referred

to), failure to include correctly formatted notations counts for a loss of two

letter grades. Also note that the formatting protocols are specific to this

professor.
