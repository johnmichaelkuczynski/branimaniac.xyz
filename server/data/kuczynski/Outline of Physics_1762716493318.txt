Measurement 
{measurement} 
requires 
starting 
point 
or 
baseline 
value 
and 
ending 
point. 
Measurements 
use 
unit 
measures. 
Measurement 
counts 
number 
of 
units 
between 
starting 
and 
ending 
points. 
Measurement 
requires

geometrizedunit 


If 
constants 
c, 
G, 
k 
are 
set 
equal 
to 
1, 
so 
c 
= 
G 
= 
k 
= 
1, 
all 
measurements 
are 
in 
centimeters 
or 
inverse 
centimeters 
{geometrized 
unit}|. 
Length 
uses 
cm, 
time 
uses 
cm^-1, 
and 
mass 
uses 
cm^5. 
The 
basis 
for 
geometrized 
units 
is 
that 
time 
and 
distance 
relate 
by 
constant 
light 
speed. 
Mass, 
time, 
and 
length 
relate, 
because 
photons 
have 
different 
energies 
at 
different 
frequencies, 
and 
time 
relates 
to 
frequency. 
Fundamental 
units 
can 
be 
velocity, 
expressed 
as 
centimeters 
per 
second, 
or 
time, 
expressed 
asseconds.

To 
convert

unit 
{conversion

multiply 
original 
measurement 
by

that

To

antiparticles 


Uncertainty 
principle 
allows 
virtual 
particles 
to 
move 
faster 
than

and 
relativity 
requires 
that 
particles 
that 
move 
faster 
than 
light 
must 
go 
backward 
in 
time. 
By 
relativity 
and 
quantum 
mechanics, 
charge 
moving 
backward 
in 
time 
is 
equivalent 
to 
opposite 
charge 
moving 
forward 
in 
time. 
Particles 
and 
antiparticles 
must 
have 
opposite 
charges. 
Virtual 
particles 
go 
forward 
in

Virtual 
antiparticles 
move

As

moving

As 
an 
electron 
moves 
through 
space-time, 
it 
can 
change 
velocity 
twice. 
This 
is 
equivalent 
to 
an 
electron-positron 
virtual-particle 
pair 
arising 
at 
the 
second 
velocity-change 
point, 
the 
virtual 
positron 
going 
backward 
in 
time 
to 
annihilate 
the 
original 
electron 
at 
the 
first 
velocity-change 
point, 
and 
the 
virtualelectroncontinuingonfrom

objects 


All 
protons, 
neutrons, 
atoms, 
and 
molecules 
have 
virtual 
particles 
at 
all 
times. 
In 
atoms, 
virtual 
negative 
charges 
stay 
closer 
to 
positively-charged 
nucleus, 
and 
virtual 
positive 
charges 
stay 
closer 
to 
negatively-charged 
electron 
orbits. 
Because 
virtual 
particles 
continually 
spontaneously 
appear 
and 
then 
annihilate, 
all 
objects 
always 
have 
virtual-particle 
distributions 
and 
complicated 
mass, 
energy, 
and/or 
charge 
distributions. 
Dirac's 
relativistic-quantum-mechanics 
equations 
can 
account 
for 
all 
virtual-
particle 
distributions, 
to 
any 
accuracy 
degree, 
by 
including 
primary, 
secondary, 
tertiary, 
and/or 
higher 
levels 
of 
virtual-particle 
creation 
and 
annihilation. 
The 
virtual-particle

accounts 
for 
most

so 
quarks

By 
uncertainty 
principle, 
more-energetic 
virtual 
particles 
have 
shorter 
times. 
Long-lived-virtualparticle 
energies 
have 
lifetimes 
of 
10^-8

so 
long-lived-virtual-particle

Times 
can

or 
6

10^22

Higher

In

because 
virtual

can 
arise 
spontaneously 
at 
any 
point 
and 
time, 
for 
any

the 
number 
of

is 
infinite. 
In

infinite. 
In 
quantum 
electrodynamics, 
quantum 
chromodynamics, 
and 
electroweak 
theory 
{Weinberg-Salam

renormalization 
cancels 
infinities. 
In 
quantum-gravity

their

Interacting 
particles 
use 
field 
to 
store 
energy 
and 
momentum 
while 
they 
send 
signals 
between 
particles 
and 
cause 
interaction. 
Field 
preserves 
conservation 
laws. 
Fields 
carry 
signals 
as 
bosons, 
which 
carry 
energy 
and 
momentum 
to 
distant 
objects. 
Local 
interactions 
caused 
by 
boson 
exchanges 
mediate 
allaction-at-a-distance. 


statistics 


Bosons 
and 
fermions 
with 
the 
same 
quantum 
numbers 
are 
exactly 
the 
same, 
so 
two 
different 
photons 
or 
electrons 
with 
the 
same 
quantum 
numbers 
are 
exactly 
the 
same. 
Because 
they 
have 
no 
relativistic 
effects 
on 
each 
other, 
bosons 
have 
symmetric 
wave 
functions: 
f(b+) 
= 
f(b-), 
where 
b+ 
has 
spin 
+1 
and 
b-has 
spin 
-1. 
Different 
bosons 
can 
have 
the 
same 
state, 
because 
bosons 
do 
not 
attract 
or 
repel 
each 
other 
by 
relativistic 
effects. 
Their 
changing 
fields 
are 
symmetrical 
and 
cancel. 
Because 
they 
have 
relativistic 
effects 
on 
each 
other, 
fermions 
have 
anti-symmetric 
wave 
functions: 
f(e+) 
= 
-f(e-), 
where 
e+ 
has 
spin 
+1/2 
and 
e-has 
spin 
-1/2. 
For 
two 
fermions, 
wavefunction 
is 
anti-symmetric 
for 
fermion 
exchange: 
f(e+,e-) 
= 
-f(e-,e+). 
For 
helium 
atoms 
(with 
two 
electrons 
in 
lowest 
orbital), 
with 
no 
time 
changes, 
the 
ground-state 
wavefunction 
is 
anti-symmetric, 
but 
the 
main 
(zero-order) 
wavefunction 
is 
symmetric, 
so 
the 
spin 
wavefunction 
is 
anti-symmetric. 
Electrons 
with 
same 
spin 
cannot 
be 
in 
same 
state 
(Pauli 
exclusion 
principle), 
because 
f(e+,e+) 
= 
-f(e+,e+) 
can 
be 
true 
only 
if 
f(e+,e+) 
= 
0. 
Different 
fermions 
have 
different 
states, 
because 
fermions 
repel 
each 
other 
by 
relativistic 
effects. 
Changing 
electric 
fields

Higgsfield 


A 
weak-force 
field 
{Higgs 
field} 
is 
evenly 
distributed 
throughout 
space 
and 
interacts 
with 
W 
bosons, 
Z 
bosons 
[1983], 
Higgs 
bosons, 
quarks, 
and 
leptons 
and 
so 
associates 
mass 
with 
them. 
Without 
Higgs 
field, 
particles 
affected 
by 
the 
weak 
force 
have 
no 
mass. 
Even 
in 
empty 
space, 
the 
Higgs 
field 
has 
non-zero 
negative 
value 
{vacuum 
expectation

The 
Higgs 
field 
interacts 
with 
particles 
affected 
by 
the 
weak 
force, 
differently 
for 
right-handed 
and 
left-handed 
particles, 
and 
so 
its 
existence 
causes, 
below 
critical 
temperature, 
weak-force 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breakdown. 
Without 
Higgs 
field, 
particles 
affected 
by 
the 
weak 
force 
have 
the 
same 
physics 
for 
right-handed 
and 
left-handed 
particles. 
Stronger 
Higgs 
field 
interactions 
make 
higher-mass

Stronger

Photons, 
gluons, 
and 
gravitons 
do 
not 
interact 
with 
Higgs 
field 
and 
have 
no 
mass. 


Standard 
Model 
requires 
only 
one

and 
one

Standard

gives 
correct

between

and

Supersymmetric 
Standard

two

three 
neutral 
and 
two 
charged. 
Supersymmetric 
Standard

By 
Standard 
Model, 
smallest 
mass 
is 
114 
to 
192 
GeV. 
By 
measurement 
[2010], 
Higgs-boson 
mass 
is 
115 
to 
156 
GeV 
or 
183 
to 
185 
GeV 
(200 
GeV 
is 
same 
as 
tau 
particle 
and 
slightly 
more 
than 
charm 
quark). 
By 
measurement 
[2011], 
Higgs-boson 
mass 
is 
115 
to 
140 
GeV. 
If 
quantum 
effects 
cause 
smallest 
Higgs-boson 
mass 
to 
be 
higher, 
other-particle 
masses 
are 
too 
high. 
By 
minimal 
supersymmetry, 
there 
are 
five 
Higgs 
bosons 
at 
114 
to 
192 
GeV, 
300 
GeV 
(similar 
to 
top 
quark), 
370 
GeV, 
and 
420 
GeV. 


Higgs 
bosons 
are 
unstable 
and 
quickly 
decay, 
and 
so 
are 
not 
directly 
observable. 
If 
elementary, 
Higgs

can

Higgs

Higgs 
bosons 
have 
no 
charge 
and 
so 
do 
not 
affect 
electromagnetism, 
and 
electromagnetism 
does 
notaffect 
them. 


Higgs 
bosons 
have 
no 
color 
and 
so 
do 
not 
affect 
strong

and 
strong 
force 
does 
not 
affect 
them. 


interactions 


Particle 
attraction 
to 
Higgs 
field 
vibrates 
Higgs 
field 
and 
makes 
Higgs 
field 
denser 
at 
particle, 
causing 
(otherwise 
massless) 
particle 
to 
slow 
from 
light 
speed. 
Higgs-field 
interactions 
with 
matter 
cause 
mass, 
inertia, 
and 
space 
curvature, 
because 
Higgs 
bosons 
form 
as 
particles 
acquire 
mass. 
Mass 
is 
proportional 
to 
Higgs-field 
strength 
and 
interaction 
strength. 
Different 
particles 
have 
different 
interactions 
and 
different 
masses. 
For 
example, 
massless 
photons 
do 
not 
interact 
with

Because

Different

Electron 
energy 
has 
quanta, 
so 
electrons 
have 
minimum

Uncertainty 
principle 
requires 
that 
energy 
cannot 
be

rotation 


Rotations 
can 
be 
spins 
or

Spins 
have

and 
angular

Orbits 
have 
orientation, 
frequency, 
angular 
momentum, 
and 
spin-orbit 
angular-momentum 
interactions. 
Spins 
and 
orbits 
have 
no 
net 
linear 
momentum, 
because 
motion 
is 
in 
all 
directions 
equally. 
Rotation 
is 
around 
point 
or

Rotation 
defines 
plane 
perpendicular

Rotation

Vibrations 
are

Vibration 
is

Vibration 
along

has 
spatial

Vibration

Vibrations

Spins

For

If

Orbital

Because

are 
radially

with 
electron 
orbits 
in 
all 
directions 
and 
so 
filling 
space, 
spherical 
orbits 
have 
no 
net

so 
no 
interaction

makes

0.

p

Double-

If

added

For

added

If

added

one

If

There

At

energy 
conserves. 
Pressure 
staysconstantthroughout

If 
fluid 
goes 
through 
narrower 
pipe 
area, 
fluid 
speeds 
up, 
because

cannot 
build 
up. 
Higher

Sideways

As

surface 
molecules 
collide, 
forcing 
object 
backward 
and 
upward{kinetic 
friction}. 


process: 
rolling 



If 
one 
surface 
rolls 
over 
another 
surface, 
collisions 
do 
not 
push 
surfaces 
upwards, 
because 
surfaces 
have

Contact

Faster

Friction 
depends 
on 
hydrogen

electric 
forces 
between

molecules. 
Smooth 
surfaces 
can 
be 
in 
close

and 
so 
have 
high 
electrical 
attractions 
and 
high 
friction.

factors: 
lubricant 


Oil, 
grease, 
and 
graphite 
can 
fill 
surface 
depressions 
and 
keep 
two 
surfaces 
separated, 
so 
surfaces 
have 
little 
hydrogen 
bonding 
or 
van 
der

forces, 
and 
friction 
is 
small. 
Heavier 
weight 
oil 
flows 
less 
easily 
and 
sticks 
to 
surfaces 
more, 
but 
stickiness 
causes 
the 
objects 
to 
have 
more 
friction. 
Lighter 
weight 
oil 
flows 
more 
easily 
and 
sticks 
to 
surfaces 
less 
but 
has 
less 
friction. 
Best-weight 
oil 
balances 
ability 
to 
stay 
in

tires 


When 
cornering, 
radial 
tires 
keep 
more

Tires

this

Tangential 
movement 
accelerates 
Moon 
away

This 
acceleration 
is 
centrifugal

Centrifugal

and 
motion 
rates

Systems

Dependent 
states 
are 
part 
of 
independent

Systems 
can 
only 
be

Particles

For

entropy:probability 


Disorder 
depends 
on 
information, 
so 
entropy 
depends 
on 
information. 
Entropy 
is 
negative 
base-2 
logarithm 
of 
probability. 
For 
example, 
for 
two 
states, 
S 
= 
-log(1 
/ 
2^1) 
= 
+1. 
For 
64 
states, 
S 
= 
-log(1 
/ 
2^6), 
so 
S 
= 
-log(1 
/ 
2^6) 
= 
+6. 
More 
states 
make 
each 
state 
less 
likely, 
so 
disorder 
and 
entropy 
increase. 


entropy:degeneracyprobability 


Degenerate-state 
groups 
have 
different 
probabilities, 
because 
groups 
have 
different 
numbers 
of 
degenerate 
states. 
Groups 
with 
more 
members 
have 
higher 
probability 
because 
independent 
states 
have 
equal 
probability. 
Entropy 
depends 
degeneracy 
pattern. 
Going 
to 
lower 
probability 
group 
increases 
system 
order 
and 
has 
less 
entropy. 
Going 
to 
higher 
probability 
group 
decreases 
system 
order 
and 
has 
moreentropy. 


Lowest-probability 
groups 
are 
reachable 
from 
only 
one 
other 
state. 
High-probability 
groups 
are 
reachable 
from 
most 
other 
states. 
Systems 
are 
likely 
to 
go 
to 
higher-probability 
groups. 
Systems 
move 
toward 
highest-probability 
group. 
In 
isolated 
closed 
systems, 
highest-probability 
group 
has 
probability 
much 
higher 
than 
other 
groups. 
If 
system 
goes 
to 
lower-probability 
group, 
it 
almost 
instantly 
goes 
to 
higher-probability 
group, 
before 
people 
can 
observe 
entropy 
decrease. 
Therefore, 
entropy 
tends 
to 
increase. 


entropy:additive 


Entropy 
and 
disorder 
are 
additive, 
because 
they 
depend 
on 
independent 
states, 
degrees 
of 
freedom. 
Systems 
with 
independent 
parts 
have 
entropy 
equal 
to 
sum 
of 
part 
entropies. 
If 
parts 
are 
dependent,entropy 
is 
less, 
because

ofdifferent 
statesisless.

Heat 
is 
total

Temperature

universeentropy 


Universe 
is 
isolated 
closed 
system. 
It 
started 
in 
low-entropy 
state 
and 
moves 
to 
higher 
entropy 
states. 


Perhaps, 
at 
beginning 
{hot 
big 
bang} 
{primordial 
fireball}, 
universe 
had 
one 
particle 
at 
one 
point 
with 
smallest 
possible 
volume, 
and 
so 
no 
relations 
among 
parts. 
There 
were 
no 
space 
fields 
and 
no 
tidal 
effects. 
Universe 
had 
highly 
concentrated 
energy 
at 
high 
temperature 
and 
so 
large 
contracting 
forces 
and 
high 
pressure. 
Particlenumber 
remained 
the 
same 
orincreased, 
asparticles 
and 
radiation 
split. 


Universe 
expansion 
increased 
space 
volume. 
Space 
points 
became 
farther 
from 
other 
points. 
Expansionwasgreatest 
at 
first. 
Thenexpansion 
slowed,becauseallparticles 
had 
gravity. 
As 
universe 
cooled, 
it 
created 
particles, 
in 
evenly 
distributed 
gas. 
Entropy 
increased 
but 
was 
still 
low. 


As 
universe 
cooled, 
gas-particle 
gravity 
formed 
galaxies 
and 
stars. 
Condensed 
gas 
had 
higher 
entropy 
but 
was 
still 
low. 
Potential 
energy 
converted 
to 
heat 
as 
infalling 
particles 
collided. 
Heat 
and 
mass 
concentrated 
instars. 


Stars 
are 
hot 
compared 
to 
space, 
so 
stars 
can 
transfer 
energy 
to 
planets 
and 
organisms. 
Stars 
undergoing 
nuclear 
fusion 
make 
visible 
light. 
Visible 
light 
has 
higher 
energy 
than 
heat 
infrared 
radiation. 
On 
Earth, 
temperature 
stays 
approximately 
constant. 
Therefore, 
visible 
light 
energy 
that 
impinges 
on 
Earth 
is 
equal 
to 
energy 
that 
radiates 
away 
from 
Earth 
as 
heat. 
Because 
sunlight 
has 
higher 
energy 
per 
photon, 
fewer 
sunlight 
photons 
land 
on 
Earth 
than 
Earth 
emits 
as 
infrared 
heat 
photons. 
Entropy 
increases 
in 
space, 
and 
total 
universe 
entropy 
increases. 
On 
Earth, 
order 
increases 
and 
disorder 
decreases, 
mostly 
in 
organisms. 
From 
universe 
beginning 
until 
now, 
universe 
entropy 
increases, 
while 
small-region 
physicalforces 
andparticle 
motionscancauseentropy 
decreases. 


Now, 
universe 
has 
many 
photons, 
large 
volume, 
negligible 
forces, 
and 
even 
matter 
distribution, 
so 
universe 
entropy 
is 
now 
large. 
For 
example, 
cosmic 
microwave 
background 
radiation 
has 
many 
randomly 
moving 
photons, 
from 
soon 
after 
universe 
origin. 
Photons 
mostly 
evenly 
distribute. 
They 
fill 
wholeuniverseandhavelittleeffectoneachother. 
Asuniverse 
expands, 
theirentropy 
becomes 
more. 


Now, 
universe 
has 
many 
galaxies 
with 
central 
black 
holes 
and 
has 
black 
holes 
formed 
after 
supernovae. 
Black 
holes 
are 
mass 
concentrations 
denser 
than 
atomic 
nuclei. 
Black 
holes 
have 
very 
high 
entropy, 
because 
particle 
number 
is 
high, 
volume 
is 
small, 
mass 
evenly 
distributes, 
gravitational 
force 
and 
fieldsarehigh, 
anddensityishigh. 
Black 
holes

In 
the 
future, 
universe 
entropy 
will

Universe 
will 
have 
more 
black

and 
can 
evolve 
to

if

system

different 
particle-energy

with 
the

If

is 
in

particles 
have 
lowest 
probability 
of

regions, 
because

If

Boltzmanndistribution 


For

Particle-energy

equilibrium 


Systems 
at 
equilibrium 
have 
Boltzmann 
distribution, 
because 
that 
distribution 
has 
much 
higher 
probability 
than 
other

with

Boltzmann

has 
the

For 
that 
reason, 
Boltzmann 
distribution 
has 
lowest 
probability 
of 
molecule 
being 
in 
any 
one 
energy 
level, 
so 
Boltzmann

Particle

For

For

which

In

probability:distinguishableparticles 


If 
particles 
are 
distinguishable, 
energy 
distributions 
are 
unique 
and 
have 
equal 
probability. 
For 
example, 
system 
can 
have 
total 
energy 
6, 
ground-state 
energy 
2, 
quantum 
1, 
and 
2 
particles. 
If 
particles 
are 
distinguishable, 
such 
as 
E1 
and 
E2, 
three 
energy 
distributions 
are 
possible. 
E1 
= 
2 
and 
E2 
= 
4. 
E1 
=

and 
E2 
=

E1

3 
and 
E2 
= 
3. 
Distribution 
E1 
= 
3 
and 
E2

has

Distribution 
E1

and 
E2

has

Distribution

and

Distributionsareequally

SeeFigure3. 


In 
this 
system, 
particles 
cannot 
have

0 
or

because 
ground-state

Only

probability:indistinguishableparticles 


Typically, 
some 
system 
particles 
are 
exactly 
the 
same 
and 
so 
indistinguishable. 
For 
example, 
all 
electrons 
arethesame. 
Ifparticlesare 
indistinguishable, 
some 
energydistributionsappearthesame. 


For 
example,

have

6, 
ground-state 
energy 
2, 
quantum 
1, 
and

indistinguishable 
particles. 
Two 
energy 
distributions 
are 
possible: 
energy 
2 
and 
energy 
4 
or 
energy 
3 
and 
energy 
3. 
Cases 
E1 
= 
2 
and 
E2 
= 
4, 
and 
E1 
= 
4 
and 
E2 
= 
2, 
are 
now 
indistinguishable. 
Energy 
distribution 
3 
and 
3 
happens 
once 
and 
has 
one-third 
probability. 
Energy 
distribution 
2 
and 
4 
happens 
twiceandhastwo-thirds 
probability. 


probability:degeneracy 


If 
particles 
are 
indistinguishable, 
some 
energy 
distributions 
have 
same 
numbers 
of 
particles 
at 
each 
energy 
level. 
In 
the 
example, 
two 
energy 
distributions 
have 
one 
particle 
at 
level 
2 
and 
one 
particle 
atlevel4,sodegeneracyistwo. 


Degenerate 
energy-distribution 
probability 
is 
degeneracy 
divided 
by 
number 
of 
distributions 
when 
particles 
are 
distinguishable. 
In 
the 
example, 
number 
of 
energy 
distributions 
with 
distinguishable 
particles 
is 
three. 
Degeneracy 
of 
"energy 
2/energy 
4" 
distribution 
is 
two, 
and 
probability 
is 
2/3. 
Degeneracy 
of 
"energy3/energy3" 
distributionis 
one,and 
probabilityis1/3. 


For 
degenerate 
distributions, 
more 
degeneracy 
makes 
higher 
probability. 
Degeneracy 
is 
greater 
if 



most 
particles 
are 
near 
average 
energy 
and 
particles 
have 
Boltzmann 
energy 
distribution. 
Maximum 
degeneracy 
spreads 
particles 
maximally. 
For 
many-particle 
systems, 
highest 
probability 
is 
many 
orders 
ofmagnitudeabove 
second-most-likelydistribution. 


partition 
number 


If 
system 
has 
constant 
total 
energy, 
distribution 
degeneracy 
{partition 
number, 
distribution} 
is 
(total 
number 
of

* 
(number

energy 
plus 
infinite 
number 
of

where 
! 
means

Above 
50 
K, 
for 
thermal 
distributions, 
partition 
number 
maximizes 
according 
to 
Boltzmann 
distribution. 


probability:particle 


Particle 
has 
probability 
that 
it 
is 
in 
energy 
level. 
If 
system 
is 
in 
energy 
distribution 
with 
maximum 
degeneracy, 
particle 
has 
lowest 
average 
probability 
that 
it 
is 
in 
energy 
level, 
because 
particles 
spread 
most 
evenly. 
Other 
energy 
distributions 
increase

probability 
that

With 
collisions, 
systems 
tend 
to 
go 
to 
most 
degenerate 
energy 
distribution, 
from 
which 
the 
most 
collisions 
make 
same 
degenerate 
distribution, 
because 
it 
repeats 
itself 
the 
most. 
This 
is 
why 
the

At

approximately

Electric 
longitudinal

between

is 
along

Because 
it 
has 
no

magnetic 
apparent-electric

cannot 
be

Magnetic

Like 
electric 
force, 
magnetic 
force 
depends 
on 
interactions 
between 
charges. 
Like 
electric 
force, 
magnetic 
force 
can 
be 
attractive 
or 
repulsive. 
If 
apparent 
moving 
charges 
and 
stationary 
charges 
are 
both 
positive 
or 
both 
negative, 
magnetism 
is 
repulsive, 
because

If 
apparent

and

have

charge, 
magnetism 
is

streaming 
outward 
as 
straight 
lines 
in 
all 
directions, 
making 
electric 
field. 
Electric 
fields 
begin 
at 
electron 
edge, 
which 
emits 
virtual 
photons. 
Electric-field 
lines 
indicate 
electric-force 
direction. 
Each 
line 
is 
one 
photon 
stream, 
so 
electric-field 
lines 
are 
not 
about 
electric-force 
strength 
or 
electric-field 
strength. 
Electric-field-line 
area 
density, 
photons 
per 
area, 
is 
electric-field 
strength. 
Because 
area 
varies 
directly 
with 
squared 
dimension, 
electric 
force 
decreases 
as 
distance 
squared: 
1/r^2. 
Electric 
field 
has 
virtual 
kinetic 
energy, 
which 
can 
transfer 
to 
other 
charges 
at 
fieldpositions 
tobecome 
potentialenergy. 


movingcharges 


Maximum 
charge 
velocity 
is 
typically 
one-tenth 
light 
speed. 
For 
constant-velocity 
charge, 
electric 
field 
moves 
at 
same 
speed 
and 
direction 
as 
charge. 
Virtual 
photons 
stream 
outward 
as 
straight 
linesin 
all 
directions. 


Constant-velocity

no 
transverseorlongitudinal 
field

movingcharges:magnetic 
force 


According 
to 
special 
relativity, 
constant-velocity 
charge 
causes 
observer 
transverse 
to 
chargemotion-
direction 
to 
see 
length 
contraction 
and 
so 
increased 
charge-motion-direction 
charge 
density. 
Length 
contraction 
makes 
flattened-spheroid 
charge 
shape, 
with 
short 
axis 
in 
motion 
direction 
and 
long 
axes 
in 
transverse-direction 
plane. 
Because 
total 
charge 
is 
same 
for 
moving 
and 
stationary 
charge, 
total 
field 
strength 
stays 
the 
same. 
Relativistically 
increased 
charge 
density 
along 
vertical 
direction 
causes 
increased 
electric 
force 
along 
horizontal 
direction. 
Therefore, 
relativistic 
length 
contraction 
makes 
electric 
field 
appear 
to 
observer 
stronger 
horizontally. 
According 
to 
special 
relativity, 
observer 
in 
front 
or 
back 
of 
constant-velocity 
charge 
does 
not 
see 
length 
contraction, 
only 
that 
charge 
approaching 
or 
receding. 
Total 
electric 
field 
strength 
is 
same 
as 
for 
stationary 
electron, 
because 
total 
charge 
is 
same. 
Because 
total 
charge 
is 
same 
as 
before, 
charge 
density 
must 
be 
less 
as 
observed 
from 
vertical 
direction, 
so 
electric 
field 
appears 
to 
observer 
weaker 
vertically. 
Vertical 
electric 
field 
is 
foreshortened 
in 
motion 
direction, 
because 
electron 
catches 
up 
to 
virtual 
photons. 
Vertical 
electric 
field 
is 
lengthened 
opposite 
tomotiondirection,becauseelectronmovesawayfrom 
virtual 
photons. 


Electric 
force 
due 
to 
relativistic 
length 
contraction 
and 
charge-density 
change, 
and 
not 
due 
to 
total 
charge, 
is 
magnetic 
force. 
(Stationary 
charges 
have 
no 
relativistic 
motion 
and 
so 
no 
relativistic 
electric 
force.) 
Adjacent 
magnetic 
force 
is 
a 
torus 
around 
moving 
charge. 
Just 
as 
electric 
forces 
act 
only 
on 
electric 
forces, 
magnetic 
forces 
act 
only 
on 
magnetic 
forces, 
because 
magnetic 
is 
perpendicular 
to 
electricand 
sodoes 
not 
affectelectric. 


Electric 
force 
has 
electric 
field. 
Electric 
force 
and 
electric 
field 
have 
same 
direction 
and 
relative 
strength. 
Because 
magnetic 
force 
is 
relativistic 
electric 
force, 
magnetic 
force 
has 
magnetic 
field. 
Magnetic 
force 
and 
magnetic 
field 
have 
same 
relative 
strength 
but 
perpendicular 
direction, 
because 
force 
is 
due 
to 
transverse 
relativistic 
length 
contraction 
and 
so 
is 
perpendicular 
to 
motion 
and 
field. 
Therefore, 
magnetic 
forces 
have 
magnetic 
fields 
perpendicular 
to 
electric 
force/magnetic 
force 
and 
perpendicular 
to 
charge-motion 
orientation. 
Moving-charge 
magnetic 
field 
is 
a 
torus 
adjacent 
to 
and 
around 
charge,transverseto 
motion 
direction. 
SeeFigure1. 


For

Electron

Magnetic 
field 
has 
virtual 
photons 
and 
so 
has 
virtual 
kinetic 
energy, 
which 
can 
transfer 
to 
other 
charges 
at 
field 
positions 
to 
become 
potential 
energy. 
Stationary

no 
magnetic

Charge 
acceleration 
pushes 
electric-field 
line 
transversely 
and 
stretches 
it 
sideways, 
causing 
tension 
and 
restoring 
force. 
Charge 
acceleration 
causes 
transverse 
electric 
field, 
while 
keeping 
radial 
field. 
Because 
virtual 
photons 
continually 
leave

along

When

When

Changing

Electric

push/pull

electric

Interaction

and 
happens 
at

so

Interaction 
is

so

All

Changing

As

Because

just

All

transverse

component 
moves

along

Electromagnetic

Traveling 
field

For 
downward 
current, 
deceleration 
decreases 
magnetic 
field, 
and 
that 
makes 
downward 
electric 
field, 
which 
increases 
magnetic

Electric

are 
in

Electric-field-line

Transverse

All

travel 
outward 
at

Previous

no

so 
only 
one 
half-wave 
exists 
at 
any

No

are 
left

because 
all

Electric

are

Therefore,

Inductions 
and 
other 
electric-field-line 
disturbances 
are 
transverse 
to 
electric-field 
lines. 
Because 
electric 
field 
oscillates 
in 
a 
plane, 
not

intensity 
decreases 
directly 
with

not 
with

Taut 
guitar

have

from

Pulling 
string 
sideways 
puts 
potential 
energy 
into 
the 
string, 
by 
stretching 
string

After 
releasing 
string, 
electric

pull

back 
by

so 
transverse

travel 
along

Wave 
speed 
depends 
on

electric-force

Wave 
takes 
energy 
with 
it, 
so 
no 
energy 
is 
left

and 
it 
no

Electric-field 
lines 
are 
like 
strings. 
Like 
guitar 
strings, 
electric-field 
lines 
have 
tension, 
because 
electric 
fields 
couple 
to 
adjacent 
magnetic 
fields, 
and 
magnetic 
fields 
couple 
to 
adjacent 
electric

Electric-field 
and 
magnetic-field 
inductions 
cause 
adjacent 
electric-field 
line 
points 
to 
attract, 
like 
molecule 
electric

Pushing 
electric-field 
line 
sideways 
adds 
potential 
energy. 
Electric-field 
and 
magnetic-field 
inductionsmake 
restoringforce 
that 
transfers

tokineticenergy. 


Electric-field-line-point 
transverse 
disturbance 
displaces 
adjacent 
points, 
which 
displace 
their 
adjacent 
points, 
so 
disturbance 
travels 
outward 
along 
electric-field

Electromagnetic 
interactions 
are 
at 
light 
speed, 
so 
wave 
has 
light 
speed. 
Wave 
takes 
energy 
with 
it, 
so 
no 
energy 
is 
left 
at 
original

point, 
and 
it 
no

oscillates.

When 
electric-field-line 
disturbance 
reaches 
test 
charges 
far 
away 
from 
original 
charge, 
test 
charges 
move 
along 
charge-motion

because

electromotive

Electric-field

Magnetic-force

is 
one-hundredth 
electric 
force. 
For 
far-away 
test 
charges, 
radial 
electric 
force 
is 
smaller 
than 
disturbance 
force, 
because 
radial 
force 
decreases 
with 
distance 
squared 
but 
transverse

decreases 
with

Original-charge

Alternating

(antenna), 
making

electric-field

that 
expand 
in

that 
go 
through

Electric-field

transverse

maximum 
transverse

Electric-

and 
magnetic-field

causes 
electric-field

by

so 
phases 
lag 
each

by 
90 
degrees. 
If 
magnetic-field 
gradient 
first 
increases 
to 
north, 
then 
electric-field 
gradient 
increases 
to 
east, 
then 
magnetic-field 
gradient 
increases 
to 
south, 
then 
electric-field 
gradient 
increases 
to 
west, 
and 
then 
magnetic-field 
gradient 
increases 
to 
north, 
and 
so 
on, 
because 
each 
drives 
the 
other 
along 
by 
transverse 
electric 
force. 
Inductions 
are 
at 
right 
angles, 
rotating 
around

of

by 
90 
degrees. 
90-degree 
rotations 
result 
in 
linearly

Source 
charge 
accelerations 
affect 
electric 
and 
magnetic 
fields 
at 
same 
time, 
so 
changing 
electric 
field 
makes 
magnetic 
field 
and 
changing 
magnetic 
field 
makes 
electric 
field 
simultaneously, 
so 
electric 
fieldand 
magnetic 
field 
arealwaysinphase. 


As 
electric 
field 
increases, 
magnetic 
field 
increases, 
because 
magnetic 
fields 
are 
relativistic 
effects 
of 
electric 
fields. 
As 
electric 
field 
decreases, 
magnetic 
field 
decreases. 
When

or

magnetic

Magnetic-field 
and 
electric-field 
changes 
increase 
and 
decrease 
in

(phase), 
because 
both

Transverse

When

electric-field

When

electric-field

are

When

and

voltage

and

When

and

and

When

and

When

Fields

Photons

Starting 
from 
stationary 
charge, 
voltage 
accelerates 
charge 
and 
adds 
kinetic 
energy. 
Increasing 
magnetic 
field 
increases 
electric 
field 
until 
increasing 
electric 
field 
has 
slowed 
increasing 
magnetic 
field 
and 
both 
are 
maximum, 
with 
potential 
energy 
maximum. 
The 
slower 
changing 
electric 
field 
decreases 
magnetic 
field, 
which 
decreases 
electric 
field, 
so 
both 
fall 
in 
phase, 
as 
potential 
energy 
becomes 
kinetic 
energy. 
As 
kinetic 
energy 
becomes

energy 
in 
the 
opposite

then

becomes

the 
half-cycle 
repeats

to 
complete

Oscillating

If

Electromagnetism

which

Those

so 
those

Force

length

Observed

is 
length 
divided 
by 
time. 
By 
experiment, 
in 
vacuum, 
all 
observers 
see 
that 
light 



has 
the 
same 
speed, 
and 
this 
is 
maximum 
observable 
object 
speed. 
Light 
has 
same 
vacuum 
maximum 
speed 
because 
space 
and 
time 
unite 
so 
that 
they 
relate 
by 
light 
speed. 
Observed 
space-time 
velocity 
for 
all 
objects 
is 
light 
speed. 
Speed 
through 
time 
and 
speed 
through 
space 
always 
add 
to 
light 
speed 
{absolute 
space-time}. 
Objects 
move 
both 
in 
space 
and 
time, 
so 
slow 
objects 
move 
more 
in 
time 
and 
less 
in 
space, 
and 
fast 
objects 
move 
more 
in 
space 
and 
less 
in 
time. 
Higher 
spatial 
velocity 
causes 
length 
contraction 
and 
time 
dilation. 
Length 
contraction 
puts 
motion 
into 
time 
dilation, 
and 
vice 
versa, 
so 
length 
contraction 
and 
time 
dilation 
are 
reciprocal. 
As 
velocity 
goes 
up, 
relative 
length 
decreases, 
and 
relative 
time 
increases, 
which 
both 
oppose 
velocity 
increase. 
Stationary 
objects 
move 
only 
through 
time. 
Atlightspeed,

at 
any

{principle

{relativity

At 
different 
relative 
velocities, 
observers 
see 
different 
length

and

dilations, 
which 
cancel 
to 
maintain 
physical

Only

absolute

Different 
velocities 
do 
not 
cause

so

Spin

Before

Different

In

mass,

unite

(energy-momentum

{4momentum}. 
Momentum

Energy

In 
space-time, 
electric

and 
magnetic

unite. 
To 
stationary 
observers, 
motion 
makes 
relativistic 
charge 
that 
has 
magnetic

To 
moving 
observers, 
the 
same 
motion 
stands 
still 
and 
charges 
have 
electric 
field. 
In 
space-time, 
electric 
field 
is 
in

and 
magnetic 
field 
is 
in

(electromagnetic-fieldtensor). 


space-time 


Objects 
travel 
through 
space-time 
at 
light 
speed. 
Universe 
objects 
are 
always 
moving, 
never 
still. 
If 
massless, 
they 
travel 
through 
space 
and 
time 
equally, 
so 
space-time 
interval 
is 
zero 
(light-like). 
If 
massive, 
they 
travel 
through 
less 
space 
and 
more

so 
space-time

has 
positive

(time-like). 
If 
negative 
mass, 
they 
travel 
through 
more 
space 
and

so 
space-time

Objects

Objects 
travel 
through 
space-time 
along 
the 
path 
of 
shortest 
spatial 
distance 
(geodesic), 
which 
is 
the 
maximum-time 
and 
straightestpath. 


At 
space-time 
points, 
mass, 
energy, 
stress, 
and 
pressure 
curve 
space-time. 
Around 
masses, 
gravity-field 
gradient 
(gravitational 
potential) 
is 
space-time 
curvature. 
Central 
masses 
curve 
local 
space-time, 
and 
that 
curvature 
pulls 
adjacent 
space-time 
points 
to 
curve 
space-time 
at 
faraway 
points. 
Alternatively, 
central 
masses 
cause 
field 
energy 
density 
at 
far 
space-time 
points, 
and 
that 
energy 
curves 
space-time. 
Farther 
away 
space-time 
points 
have 
less 
curvature, 
because 
same 
energy 
spreads 
over 
more 
surface 
area, 
so 
energy 
density 
is 
less. 
Energy 
and 
curvature 
spread 
to 
infinity 
at 
light 
speed, 
because 
space-time 
has 
that 
tension 
and 
propagation 
characteristics, 
the 
same 
as 
light-propagation 
speed. 


Gravity 
does 
not 
have 
to 
have 
space-time 
tidal 
effects, 
because 
local 
fields 
can 
be 
uniform, 
two 
fieldscancancel,and 
pressurecancancel 
gravity, 
so 
space-time 
curvature 
is 
zeroor 
constant. 


Freely 
falling 
observers 
see 
no 
space-time

because 
they 
see 
no

because 
they

To

Space-time

so

increases 
as

decreases. 
At 
space-time 
events, 
mass 
acceleration 
means 
space-time 
curvature. 


Space 
and

unite 
so 
that 
time 
dimension 
relates 
to 
space 
dimensions 
by 
light

Space-time

Gravitons 
are 
quanta 
of 
gravitational 
waves 
in 
space-time. 
Gravitons 
propagate 
through 
empty 
space 
as 
traveling 
waves 
in 
field 
surfaces, 
just 
as 
photons 
propagate 
through 
empty 
space 
as 
traveling 
waves 
in 
field 
lines, 
and 
the 
field 
surfaces 
and 
field 
lines 
have 
the 
same 
tension, 
which 
is 
maximum 
tension 
that 
they 
can 
have. 
Therefore, 
gravitons 
travel 
at 
light 
speed, 
as 
they 
should 
because 
they 
have 
no 
mass. 
Alternatively, 
all 
massless 
bosons 
propagate 
the 
same 
because 
they 
are 
really 
the 
same 
at 
high 
energy. 
Becausegravitons

Mass 
and 
energy 
relate 
through 
light

because 
electromagnetic 
force 
and 
gravitational 
force 
have 
specific 
strengths 
and 
are 
infinite-distance 
forces 
using 
massless 
particles. 
By 
experiment, 
in 
vacuum, 
everything 
travels 
at

space-time. 
Total

Potential

includes

due 
to

In 
relativity, 
particle 
mass, 
energy, 
and 
momentum 
combine 
in 
one 
vector 
{energy-momentum 
four-vector}. 
Time-like

Space-

The

(Divide

Stationary 
observers 
see 
that 
resting 
masses 
{proper 
mass} 
have 
no 
speed 
through 
space 
dimensions, 
so 
rest 
masses 
travel 
only 
in 
the 
time 
dimension, 
at 
light 
speed. 
Potential 
energy 
and 
kinetic 
energy 
are 
zero. 
Momentum 
is 
zero. 
The 
4-momentum-vector 
length 
is 
m 
* 
c 
along 
time 
dimension. 
Therefore, 
E^2/c^2 
-p^2 
= 
(m 
* 
c)^2. 
p 
= 
0, 
so 
E 
= 
-m 
* 
c^2 
{E 
equals 
m 
c 
squared}. 
m 
is 
rest 
mass, 
so

is 
equivalentto

Observers

that

travel 
half 
through

and 
half 
through 
time, 
with 
net 
space-time 
speed 
equal 
to 
light

Potential

is 
zero. 
Kinetic

relativity 


In 
special 
relativity, 
velocity 
is 
through 
both 
time 
and 
space, 
and 
all 
objects 
travel 
at 
light 
speed 
through 
space-time. 
Higher-velocity 
objects 
travel 
more 
through 
space 
and 
less 
through 
time. 
Traveling 
more 
through 
space 
increases 
relativistic 
mass, 
momentum, 
and 
energy. 
In 
special 
relativity, 
because 
time 
dilates, 
relativistic 
mass 
m 
increases 
with 
velocity: 
m 
= 
m0 
/ 
(1 
-(v^2 
/ 
c^2))^0.5, 
where 
c 
is 
light 
speed, 
v 
is 
velocity, 
and 
m0 
is 
rest 
mass. 
From 
E

m 
* 
c^2, 
E 
= 
(m0

/ 
(1 
-(v^2

In

For

For

p 
=

and 
E

For

If

mr

If

mr 
= 
(m0^2

At 
high

m 
is 
very 
large, 
so 
m

m0 
and 
mr 
= 
m. 
Therefore, 
m

Relativity 
applies 
to 
all 
motions, 
not 
just 
ones 
at 
high

Fast 
relative 
motions 
show 
relativistic 
effects 
at 
short

Slow 
relative 
motions 
can 
have 
relativistic 
effects 
at 
large

For

{local

Physical

Local 
interactions 
can 
be 
linear 
and 
use 
tensors 
on 
the

Minkowski

Observers 
can 
measure 
relative 
transverse

{relative

with

to 
other

lightsignals,clocks

Two 
objects

Two

Relative

motion:acceleration 


Moving 
requires 
gravitational 
or 
mechanical 
force 
and 
energy 
to 
accelerate 
mass, 
or 
electromagnetic 
force 
and 
energy 
to 
accelerate

More

requires 
more

More

orcharge 
requires

Massless 
particles 
do 
not 
have 
inertia 
and 
do 
not

from 
gravitational 
interactions 
with 
other 
masses. 
Adding 
gravitational 
or 
mechanical 
energy 
to 
massless 
particles 
does 
not 
increase 
their 
velocities, 
because 
those 
forces 
only 
act 
on 
masses. 
Massless 
particles 
have 
maximum 
velocity. 
Because 
massless 
particles 
have 
no 
inertia 
and 
no 
acceleration, 
they 
always 
travel 
at

Observers

Because 
there 
is

space

to 
prevent 
faster-than-light 
speeds. 
Space

Resting 
objects 
do 
not

and 
so 
travel 
only 
through

Moving 
objects 
travel

and

The 
faster 
they

the 
more

Relative 
velocity 
measures 
proportion 
of 
light

through

Light 
has 
maximum 
speed 
and 
travels 
half

and 
half 
through

Nothing 
can 
travel 
more 
than 
half

and 
less 
than

By

If

in

and 
length

If

Time

If

If

If

Negative

impossible. 
If

If

Traveling

length 
contraction 


Observers 
measure 
length 
using 
rulers, 
which 
have 
known 
lengths 
{unit 
length} 
{length 
unit}, 
such 
as 
one 
meter. 
To 
count 
length, 
observers 
measure 
number 
of 
unit 
lengths 
between 
space-time 
locations. 


referenceframe 


Observers 
have 
a 
coordinate 
system 
and 
reference 
frame 
centered 
on 
themselves. 
Observers, 
and 
objects 
travelingwiththem,arestationary 
inreference 
frames. 


ruler 
observations 


Observers 
check 
their 
rulers 
for 
accuracy 
by 
side-by-side 
comparison 
to 
stationary 
reference 
ruler. 
Experiments 
show 
that 
stationary 
rulers 
maintain 
accuracy 
over 
time 
and 
space. 
Observers 
use 
their 
rulers 
to 
measure 
objects 
that 
are 
stationary 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
reference 
frame. 
Observers 
can 
observe 
stationary 
ormoving 
reference-ruler 
copiesatotherspace 
locations. 


length 
contraction 


In 
space-time, 
stationary 
observer 
sees 
that 
moving 
object 
has 
shorter 
length 
in 
movement 
direction 
{distance 
contraction} 
{length 
contraction}| 
than 
stationary 
object. 
Moving 
observer 
sees 
that 
stationary 
object 
moves 
and 
has 
shorter 
length 
in 
movement 
direction. 
Both 
cases 
have 
same 
relative 
velocity. 
SeeFigure1. 


length 
contraction:cause 


Byexperiment,observers 
seethat 
lighthasconstantspeed,nomatterobserverspeed. 
Observeror 
source 
motion 
does 
not 
change 
observed 
light 
speed, 
but 
must 
change 
something. 
Observer 
or 
source 
motion 
therefore 
affects 
space, 
time, 
and 
mass 
measurements. 
Length 
must 
contract 
and 
time 
must 
dilate, 
so 
light 
speed 
staysconstantasrelative 
motionadds 
speed. 


length 
contraction:object 
speed 


Because 
length 
contracts 
and 
time 
dilates, 
all 
object 
motion 
through 
space-time 
is 
always 
at 
light 
speed. 
Speed 
retards 
motion 
through 
time 
and 
increases 
motion 
through 
space. 
Speed 
is 
like 
drag 
on 
time. 
As 
velocity 
increases, 
motion 
is 
more 
in 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
less 
in 
time 
dimension. 
For 
moving 
objects, 
with 
higher 
speed, 
space 
velocity 
goes 
up, 
and 
time 
velocity 
goes 
down. 
When 
time 
separation 
is 
more, 
space-time 
separation 
is 
less. 
When 
time 
separation 
is 
less, 
space-time 
separation 
is 
more. 


Velocitythroughspace

time 
minus

all 
divided 
by 
time: 
(c*t 
-x) 
/ 
t. 
At 
rest, 
stationary 
objects 
move 
only 
through 
time, 
at 
light 
speed. 
For 
stationary 
objects, 
space 
velocity 
is 
zero. 
At 
light 
speed, 
objects 
move 
equally 
throughspaceandtime.

length 
contraction:direction 


Length 
contraction 
happens 
only 
in 
movement 
direction. 
Directions 
perpendicular 
to 
movement 
directionhave 
no 
movementcomponent 
and 
arestationary. 


length 
contraction:distancefromobserver 


Distance 
away 
does 
not 
affect 
length-contraction 
percentage, 
because 
contraction 
direction 
is 
perpendicularto 
distancedirection. 


length 
contraction:invariance 


Exchanging 
space 
and 
time 
keeps 
physical 
laws 
invariant 
for 
both 
stationary 
and 
moving 
observers. 


simultaneity 


Events 
appear 
simultaneous 
when 
information 
from 
them 
reaches 
observer 
space-time 
point. 
Stationary 
observer 
receives 
information 
from 
both 
ends 
of 
stationary 
ruler 
perpendicular 
to 
sightline 
at 
same 
time. 
When 
stationary 
observer 
looks 
at 
stationary 
ruler, 
whole 
ruler 
is 
at 
same 
time 
on 
time 
axis 
and 
so 
space-like,becausenopoints

simultaneity:light 


When 
observers, 
including 
observers 
traveling 
at 
light 
speed, 
look 
at 
light, 
they 
receive 
information 
at 
light 
speed, 
because 
light 
cannot 
be 
faster 
or 
slower. 
When 
stationary 
observers 
look 
at 
light, 
events 
along 
light 
path 
have 
equal 
space 
and 
time 
separations 
on 
space 
and 
time 
axes. 
When 
observers 
move 
at 
light 
speed, 
events 
along 
light 
path 
appear 
to 
have 
same 
spatial 
location 
on 
space 
axisandso 
time-like. 


simultaneity:relativemotion 
andlengthcontraction 


When 
stationary 
observer 
looks 
at 
moving 
ruler, 
observer 
cannot 
know 
information 
about 
whole 
rulerat 
same 
timeon 
time 
axis. 
See 
Figure 
1. 
Compared 
tostationaryruler,ruler 
leading 
point 
is 
earlier 
in 
time 
and 
so 
behind 
in 
space, 
and 
trailing 
point 
is 
later 
in 
time 
and 
so 
ahead 
in 
space, 
to 
make 
constant 
space-time 
separation 
between 
ends. 
Though 
ruler 
has 
constant 
space-time 
separation, 
observer 
sees 
length 
contraction 
and 
time 
dilation. 
Length 
contraction 
contracts 
observed 
length 
and 
unit 
length 
by 
same 
percentage, 
so 
number 
of 
units 
measured 
is 
the 
same, 
and 
physical 
laws 
do 
not 
change. 


simultaneity:timedilation 
andlengthcontraction 


Length 
contraction 
and 
time 
dilation 
are 
opposites, 
so 
the 
effects 
cancel, 
physical 
laws 
do

havesamespace-timeseparationsas 
in

space-timegraph 


Outside 
observers 
can 
make 
space-time 
graphs 
to 
represent 
stationary 
and 
moving 
points 
and 
observers. 
Space-time 
graph 
has 
space 
and 
time 
dimensions. 
All 
dimensions 
have 
same 
units, 
either

equalweight. 


On 
space-time 
graphs, 
moving

observed 
from

are 
vectors. 
Objects 
arepointsets. 
SeeFigure2. 


Space-timegraphs 
arenot 
likeregularspace

because 
space

have 
opposite

Motions 
cannot 
go 
to 
all 
space-time

as 
they 
can 
in 
regular

Distances

When

all

move 
at

through

When 
moving 
object 
passes 
stationary 
observer, 
one 
part 
reaches 
observer 
before 
other 
parts. 
Other 
parts 
lag 
behind 
in 
time, 
because 
they 
are 
traveling 
through

at

It 
takes 
time 
for 
other

Moving

goes

faster, 
so

Moving

Because 
length 
contracts 
and

dilates, 
object 
motion 
through 
space-time 
is 
always 
at 
light 
speed. 
Speed 
retards 
motion 
through 
time 
and 
increases 
motion 
through 
space. 
Speed 
is 
like 
drag 
on 
time. 
As 
velocity 
increases, 
motion 
is 
more 
in 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
less 
in

dimension. 
For

When

including 
observers 
traveling 
at 
light

look 
at 
light, 
they 
receive 
information 
at 
light

because 
light

or

When 
stationary

along

have 
equal 
space 
and

on

When

When

about 
all 
clock

at

See 
Figure

Compared 
to

clock 
first

is

in

and 
so 
earlier

to

Though

space-timegraph 


Outside 
observers 
can 
make 
space-time 
graphs 
to 
represent 
stationary 
and 
moving 
points 
and 
observers. 
Space-time 
graph 
has 
space 
and 
time 
dimensions. 
All 
dimensions 
have 
same 
units, 
either 
time 
units 
or 
length 
units, 
so 
axes 
have 
equal 
weight. 
On 
space-time 
graphs, 
moving 
objects 
observed 
fromobserverstationarypointcan 
be 
vectors. 
Objects 
arepointsets. 
SeeFigure2. 


Space-time 
graph 
is 
not 
like 
regular 
space 
and 
time 
graph, 
because 
space 
and 
time 
dimensions 
have 
opposite 
effects. 
Motions 
cannot 
go 
to 
all 
space-time 
points, 
as 
they 
can 
in 
regular

Distances 
include

In

Inthiscase,

For

when 
it 
reaches

resonating-wave 
oscillation,

Clocks 
have 
wavelengths, 
frequencies, 
and 
periods. 
See 
Figure

Signal 
travels 
from 
end 
to

Time 
to

is

as 
time 
to

for 
stationary

Traveltimeis

To 
measure 
moving 
clock, 
stationary 
observer 
at 
first 
clock 
beat 
can 
send 
signal 
to 
reflector 
at 
other 
end. 
Clock 
reflector 
moves 
closer 
as

travels 
and 
reflects 
earlier. 
Observer

measurement:time 


When 
object 
and 
observer 
are 
stationary, 
all 
system 
parts 
move 
at 
light 
speed 
through 
time. 
When 
moving 
object 
passes 
stationary 
observer, 
one 
part 
reaches 
observer 
before 
other 
parts. 
Other 
parts 
lag 
behind 
in 
time, 
because 
they 
are 
traveling 
through 
time 
at 
less 
than 
light 
speed. 
It 
takes 
time 
from 
other 
parts 
to 
reach 
observer. 
Moving 
object 
goes 
through 
space 
faster, 
so 
lengths 
appear 
shorter. 
Moving 
object 
goes 
through 
time 
slower, 
so 
time 
slows. 
See 
Figure 
2. 
At 
less 
than 
light 
speed, 
angle 
is 
less 
than 
45 
degrees. 
Atlightspeed,angle

degrees. 


measurement:frequency 


Frequencies 
are 
clocks. 
Time 
interval 
unit 
is 
time 
between 
beats 
or 
ticks, 
such 
as 
one 
second. 
Time 
is 
number 
of 
beats 
or 
ticks, 
such 
as 
60 
cycles. 
When 
time 
slows, 
frequency 
decreases, 
wavelength 
increases, 
time 
unit 
increases, 
and 
cycles 
decrease. 
Time 
dilation 
makes 
time 
unit 
become 
longer, 
so 
number 
ofticksisfewer,sotime 
passes 
more 
slowly. 


measurement:Dopplereffect 


Light 
travels 
at 
constant 
speed. 
If 
wavelength 
decreases, 
frequency 
increases. 
If 
wavelength 
increases, 
frequency 
decreases. 
If 
object 
is 
moving 
away, 
Doppler 
effect 
makes 
wavelength 
increase 
and 
frequency 
decrease. 
If 
object 
is 
moving 
closer, 
Doppler 
effect 
makes 
wavelength 
decrease 
and 
frequency 
increase. 
Faster 
motions 
make 
greater 
Doppler

Time

Stationary

are 
really 
looking 
down 
on

Moving

Stationary

Stationary

that 
moving

has 
less

and 
more

Angle 
between 
stationary 
axes 
is 
90 
degrees. 
Angle 
between

Angle 
between

between 
90 
and

in 
this 
case, 
135

Middle 
moves 
toward 
where 
leading 
tick

and 
away 
from 
where 
trailing

For 
signals

Time 
dilation 
is 
like 
looking 
at 
clock 
rotated 
at 
angle 
to 
movement 
direction, 
with 
rotation 
through 
time 
dimension. 
Time 
dilation 
is 
like 
looking 
at 
clock 
from 
farther 
away, 
as 
velocity 
increases, 
because 
time 
separation 
grows, 
so 
space-time 
separation 
grows. 
Time 
dilation 
is 
light 
rays 
that 
curve 
inward 
from 
both 
clock 
ends, 
like 
a 
concave 
lens, 
opposite 
from

Time

is

real

imaginary

Space-time

In

such 
as

Mass

Observed

Experiments 
show 
that 
stationary

maintain

Observers 
use 
their 
standard

to

that 
are

with

to 
their

Observers

Mass 
inversely 
relates 
to 
distance 
and 
directly 
relates 
to 
time, 
because 
momentum 
is 
mass 
times 
velocity, 
and 
velocity 
is 
distance 
divided 
by

Observeror 
source 
motion 
does 
not 
change 
observed 
light 
speed, 
but 
must 
change 
something. 
Observer 
or 
source 
motion 
therefore 
affects 
space, 
time, 
and 
mass 
measurements. 
Length 
must 
contract 
and 
time 
must 
dilate, 
so 
light 
speed 
stays 
constant 
as 
motion 
adds 
speed. 
Mass 
inversely 
relates 
to 
distance 
and 
directly 
relates 
to 
time, 
so 
mass 
increases. 
Mass 
gains 
kinetic 
energy 
by 
moving. 
Stationary 
mass 
travels 
only 
through

not 
space, 
and 
has 
only

Moving

mass

speed 


Because 
length 
contracts 
and 
time 
dilates, 
object 
motion 
through 
space-time 
is 
always 
at 
light 
speed. 
Speed 
retards 
motion 
through 
time 
and 
increases 
motion 
through 
space. 
Speed 
is 
like 
drag 
on 
time. 
As 
velocity 
increases, 
motion 
is 
more 
in 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
less 
in 
time 
dimension. 
For 
moving 
objects, 
with 
higher 
speed, 
space 
velocity 
goes 
up 
and 
time

goes

Whentime

Velocity 
through

is

At 
rest, 
stationary 
objects 
move 
only 
through 
time, 
at 
light 
speed. 
For 
stationary 
objects, 
space

Atlightspeed,

Mass 
inversely 
relates 
to 
distance 
and 
directly 
relates 
to 
time, 
so 
mass 
increases 
as 
it 
goes 
more 
into

dimensions. 
Particles

Gravity 
can 
become 
strong 
enough 
to 
overcome 
all 
accelerations, 
so 
even

Outgoing

Space

so 
much 
that 
it 
closes

forming 
a

not 
observable 
from

Only 
gravity 
can 
cause 
space-time

gravitationalentropy 


Entropy 
depends 
on 
topology 
Euler 
number. 
Gravity 
curves 
space-time 
and 
creates 
different 
topologies, 
so 
gravity 
has 
entropy. 
Only 
gravity 
has 
entropy, 
because 
other 
forces 
cannot

becausegravityforce

gravitationalentropy: 
black 
hole 


Because 
gravity 
has 
entropy 
and 
forms 
black 
holes, 
black 
holes 
trap 
entropy. 
Black-hole 
trapping 
amount 
depends 
on 
event-horizon 
radius, 
so 
black-hole 
entropy 
depends 
on 
event-horizon 
spatial 
area. 
Because 
black 
holes 
have 
entropy, 
they 
have 
surface 
temperature 
at 
event 
horizon. 
At 
event 
horizon, 
virtual-particle 
creation 
can 
allow 
one 
virtual-pair 
member 
to 
tunnel 
through 
event 
horizon 
to 
space, 
causing 
black 
hole 
to 
lose 
matter 
and 
eventually 
dissipate. 
Entropy 
decreases, 
rather 
than 
always 
increasing.

Gravity

where

Gravity

cannot

Gravity 
depends 
on

Mass

Perhaps, 
gravity 
can

Exotic

have 
negative

Larger

If

At

tend 
to 
transfer 
heat 
to 
space, 
because 
absorption 
concentrates 
on 
one 
location 
but 
emission 
spreads 
to 
all 
other 
locations 
and 
so 
never 
returns 
to 
the 
location. 
By 
energy 
equipartition, 
all 
frequencies 
have 
equal 
probability. 
Without 
quantum 
mechanics, 
higher 
frequencies 
carry 
away 
most 
energy, 
and 
hot 
objects 
cool 
quickly. 
However, 
experiments 
show 
a 
Boltzmann 
distribution 
of 
frequencies, 
with 
higherfrequencies 
havinglower 
probabilities. 
Hot

In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
particles 
have 
discrete 
states 
and 
discontinuous 
fields. 
In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
length, 
time, 
and 
mass 
have 
quanta, 
with 
non-zero 
minimum 
(Planck) 
length, 
time, 
and 
mass. 
Minimum 
length 
makes 
maximum 
momentum. 
Minimum 
time 
makes 
maximum 
energy. 
Minimum 
mass 
makes 
maximum 
frequency. 
For 
each 
property, 
particles 
have 
one 
quantum 
plus 
a 
number 
of 
quanta, 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
number. 
Atom 
electrons 
must 
have 
minimum 
energy 
and 
so 
do 
decay 
into 
atom 
nuclei. 
Higher 
states 
have 
lower 
probabilities, 
because 
higher 
states 
are 
harder 
to 
reach. 
High-frequency 
electromagnetic 
waves 
are 
fewer. 
Quantum 
mechanics 
results 
in 
Boltzmann

and

Quantum

Particle-collision, 
light-absorption, 
and 
light-emission 
experiments 
show 
that 
particles 
absorb 
or 
emit 
energy 
in 
non-zero 
minimum 
amounts 
(quantum). 
Charge 
accelerations 
differ 
by 
a 
number 
of 
quanta. 
Minimum 
electromagnetic-wave 
energy 
varies 
directly 
with

Higher 
energy 
means 
more 
electromagnetic

Simultaneously 
sending 
particles 
through 
two 
slits 
makes 
almost 
the 
same 
target 
patterns 
as 
sending 
electromagnetic 
waves, 
suggesting 
that 
particles 
behave 
like 
waves. 
Large 
particles 
at 
ordinary 
energies 
have 
very 
high-frequency 
waves 
with 
imperceptible 
wavelengths. 
Atomic-and 
subatomic-
particles 
have 
low-frequency 
waves 
with 
observable 
wavelengths. 
Particles 
have 
waves 
in 
phase 
space, 



not 
in 
space-time. 
Particle 
waves 
have 
fundamental 
frequency, 
at 
lowest 
energy 
level, 
and 
higher 
harmonic 
frequencies 
at 
higher 
energy 
levels. 
Particle 
waves 
have 
discrete, 
not 
continuous, 
frequencies 
at 
overtones 
of 
the 
fundamental 
frequency. 
Wave

Quantum-mechanics

in

Particles

because 
they 
cannot

because 
they

and

Particles 
have 
a 
lowest

(ground

which 
corresponds 
to 
the

Observations 
interact 
with 
particle 
to 
put 
particle 
in 
one 
observed 
state. 
Observation 
immediately 
and 
discontinuously 
selects 
observed 
state 
from 
among 
possible

From 
that 
moment, 
phase-space 
again 
follows

and

Scientific 
experiments 
try 
to 
isolate

from

to 
prevent

However, 
in 
experiments 
involving 
small 
things, 
observation 
has 
to 
cause

and 
perturb

Perception 
theory 
is 
about 
physical

that

Quantum

has 
no 
perception 
theory. 
Quantum 
theory 
does 
not 
describe 
observer, 
only 
observed 
system. 
Quantum 
mechanics 
leaves 
open 
the 
possibility 
of 
perceiving 
state 
superposition. 
However, 
people 
and 
instruments 
detect 
only 
states 
and 
never 
observe 
state 
superpositions. 
Quantum-mechanical 
waves 
are 
inphasespace,notphysicalspace. 


particle 
systems 


Without 
quantum 
mechanics, 
particle 
systems 
follow 
classical 
statistical 
Markov 
processes, 
such 
as 
diffusion 
and 
Brownian 
motion, 
in 
space-time. 
Diffusion 
and 
Brownian 
motion 
apply 
energy 
and 
momentum 
conservation 
to 
many 
particles. 
Many 
particles 
follow 
many 
paths 
(path 
distribution), 
completely 
determined 
by 
previous 
positions 
and 
momenta. 
Particles 
tend 
to 
have 
the 
highestprobabilityenergy 
distribution. 


Quantum-mechanics 
equations 
(Schršdinger 
equation) 
also 
derive 
from 
energy 
and 
momentum 
conservation 
and 
are 
similar 
to 
diffusion 
and 
Brownian-motion 
equations. 
Quantum-mechanics 
equations 
are 
about 
coordinate 
space 
or 
phase 
space, 
rather 
than 
physical 
space. 
Quantum-mechanics 
functions 
(wavefunction) 
are 
complex-number 
functions, 
which 
relate 
trigonometric 
and 
exponential 
functions. 
Because 
particles 
can 
be 
anywhere 
along 
infinitedimensions, 
wavefunctions 
are 
over 
infinite 
space 
and 
number 
of 
possible 
system 
phase-space 
states 
is 
infinite. 
In 
phase 
space, 
particles 
have 
possible 
trajectories 
(path 
distribution), 
each 
with 
different 
probability. 
Previous 
positions 
and 
momenta 
determine 
only 
probabilities 
of 
later 
paths. 
The 
sum 
of 
all 
probabilities 
equals 
1 
= 
100% 
that 
the 
particle 
is 
somewhere. 
All 
possible 
states 
exist 
simultaneously 
and 
evolve 
independently. 
In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
particle 
measurement 
causes 
only 
one 
phase-space 
state/path 
to 
be 
observed. 
That 
statetendstohave 
the 
highest 
probability. 


particle 
systems:superposition 


In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
particles 
have 
wavefunctions. 
Particle 
systems 
have 
wavefunctions 
that 
are 
particle-wavefunctionlinear 
combinations(superposition), 
just 
aselectromagnetic 
wavessuperpose. 
Particle 
wavefunctions 
evolve 
independently, 
just 
as 
electromagnetic 
waves 
are 
independent. 
Waves 
do 



nothave 
multiplicativeor 
dependenteffectsoneachother. 


Because 
wavefunctions 
are 
complex-number 
functions, 
wavefunctions 
can 
add 
in 
two 
ways, 
constructive 
interference, 
A 
+ 
B, 
and 
destructive 
interference, 
A 
-B 
= 
B 
-A. 
It 
is 
like 
positive 
and 
negative 
momentum, 
as 
in 
a 
reverberating 
system. 
Both 
superpositions 
are 
possible 
phase-space 
states, 
withprobabilities. 


particle 
systems:normalization 


For 
linear 
equations, 
dividing 
all 
terms 
by 
any 
number 
results 
in 
equivalent 
equations, 
with 
same 
equation 
solutions. 
Dividing 
by 
any 
number 
only 
changes 
term 
coefficients/weights. 
Therefore, 
only 
coefficient/weight 
ratios 
determine 
equation 
meaning. 
Making 
sum 
of 
squared 
coefficients/weights 
equal 
one 
makes 
total 
probability 
1 
= 
100% 
(normalization). 
Normalizing 
weights 
reflects 
the 
physical 
meaningof 
quantum-mechanicslinearequations,thatallstateprobabilities 
addto 
100%. 


particle 
systems:actionat 
a 
distance 


Physical 
processes 
can 
create 
two 
particles 
simultaneously, 
making 
two-particle 
systems. 
Both 
particles 
share 
one 
system 
wavefunction 
and 
have 
related 
energy 
levels. 
Measurement 
on 
one 
particle 
immediately 
affects 
systemwavefunction 
and, 
byconservationlaws, 
determinesstatesofbothparticles, 
even 
if 
other 
particle 
is 
far 
away. 
State 
determination 
happens 
faster 
than 
light 
speed 
(action 
at 
a 
distance), 
appearing 
to 
send 
information 
faster 
than 
light 
and 
so 
violate 
relativity. 
However, 
observer 
knowledge 
of 
newly 
determined

happens 
only 
after 
information 
travels 
at 
light 
speed 
back 
to

isintact. 


particle 
systems:energypartitioning 


As 
in 
classical 
mechanics, 
for 
a 
specific 
total 
energy, 
quantum-mechanics 
phase-space 
wave 
interactions 
transfer 
total 
energy 
among 
wave 
frequencies 
so 
that 
energy 
distribution 
(Boltzmann 
distribution) 
is 
the 
wave-frequency 
distribution 
with 
maximum 
number 
of 
system 
states.

wave-particle 
duality 


Quantum 
mechanics 
combines 
ideas 
about 
particles 
and 
waves 
(wave-particle 
duality). 
Particles 
have 
energies. 
Waves 
have 
wavelengths 
and 
positions. 
To 
calculate 
energies, 
quantum 
mechanics 
uses 
particleproperties. 
Tocalculatepositions, 
quantummechanics 
uses 
wave 
properties. 


waves 


Quantum-mechanical 
particle 
phase-space 
waves 
extend 
infinitely 
in 
space 
and 
time. 
Wave 
equations 
have 
noinitialconditions 
orboundaries. 


waves:wave 
packets 


Superposing 
many 
similar-frequency 
waves 
cancels 
amplitudes 
in 
most 
places 
but 
increases 
amplitude 
in 
a 
small 
space-time 
interval 
(wave 
packet). 
Wave 
packets 
are 
particles. 
Particles 
have 
many 
similar-frequency 
waves. 
Wave-packet 
frequency 
varies 
directly 
with 
particle 
energy. 
Wave-
packet 
amplitude 
varies 
directly 
with 
particle-wave 
phase 
range, 
because 
narrower 
phase 
range 
makes 
higher 
amplitude. 


waves:particle 
energies 


Waves 
have 
frequency 
and 
wavelength. 
Quantum-mechanics 
wave-equation 
solutions 
are 
particle 
wavefunctions. 
Periodic 
solutions 
are 
true 
at 
lowest 
frequency 
and 
at 
all 
integer 
multiples 
(harmonics/overtones) 
of 
that 
frequency, 
because 
those 
waves 
have 
the 
same 
phase. 
Other 
frequencies 
have 
different 
phases 
and 
are 
not 
solutions. 
Wavefunction 
frequency 
varies 
directly 
with 
particle 
energy. 
Waves 
with 
higher 
frequency 
have 
higher 
energy, 
because 
field 
change 
is 
more 
when 
wavelength 
is 
less, 
so 
momentum 
change 
is 
more. 
Therefore, 
wavefunctions 
represent 
a 
series 
of 
possible 
particle 
energies. 
Energy 
levels 
differ 
by 
energy 
quanta. 
Particle-wave 
frequencies 
and 
energies 
arenot 
continuousbutdiscrete. 


waves:position 


Waves 
have 
frequency 
and 
wavelength 
and 
occupy 
space 
and 
time 
intervals. 
Waves 
cannot 
be 
at 
points. 
Particles 
andfieldsare 
wavesandso 
havenodefinite 
position. 


waves:shapes 



Reverberations 
cause 
resonance 
and 
standing 
waves. 
Standing 
waves 
have 
different 
shapes 
depending 
on 
space 
boundaries 
and 
spin 
and 
orbit 
rotations. 
String 
waves 
have 
nodes 
at 
ends. 
For 
overtones 
of 
fundamental 
frequency, 
string 
waves 
have 
nodes 
at 
regular 
intervals. 
Molecule 
electrons 
have 
spherical 
s 
orbits 
and 
p, 
d, 
and 
f 
orbits 
with 
nodes. 
Wave 
shapes 
reflect 
average 
field 
density 
and 
probabilities 
that 
particle 
is 
in 
those 
space 
regions. 
In 
dynamic 
systems, 
wave 
shapes 
can 
vary 
over 
time. 


waves:uncertainty 


If 
wave 
has 
higher 
wavelength, 
position 
interval 
is 
wider 
and 
is 
less 
certain, 
but 
momentum 
and 
energy 
change, 
measured 
as 
less 
steep 
wave 
slope, 
is 
slower 
and 
so 
more 
certain. 
If 
wave 
has 
lower 
wavelength, 
position 
interval 
is 
narrower 
and 
is 
more 
certain, 
but 
momentum 
and 
energy 
change, 
measured 
as 
steeper 
wave 
slope, 
is 
faster 
and 
so 
less 
certain. 
Therefore, 
both 
position 
and 
momentum 
cannotbespecific,andone 
ortheother, 
orboth,areuncertain. 


waves:complex-numberexponentialfunctions 


Wavefunctions 
are 
sine 
or 
cosine 
(trigonometric) 
functions. 
For

and

For

For

l, 
field

sin(2

Because 
e^(i*a) 
= 
cos(a) 
+ 
i 
* 
sin(a), 
where 
a 
is 
angle 
in 
radians 
and 
is

wavefunctions 
are 
complex-number 
exponential

sin(a)

cos(a)

Phase-space

As

As

Particle

Particles

Propagating 
waves

Waves 
cannot 
have

so

Because

In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
phase 
space 
includes 
particle 
positions 
and 
momenta 
and 
so 
includes 
physical 
space. 
Particle 
systems 
have 
phase-space 
waves 
that 
determine 
probabilities 
of 
particle 
positions 
and 
momenta 
at 
times. 
In 
bounded 
space 
regions, 
such 
as 
atoms, 
molecules, 
and 
boxes, 
particles 
have 
resonating 
phase-space 
waves, 
with 
stationary 
points 
at 
boundaries, 
whose 
frequencies 
are 
harmonics. 
For 
example, 
a 
particle 
in 
a 
box 
has 
phase-space 
waves, 
with 
stationary 
points 
at 
box 
walls, 
which 
have 
fundamental 
frequency, 
twice 
fundamental 
frequency, 
thrice 
fundamental 
frequency, 
and 
so 
on. 
Phase-space 
wave 
frequencies 
determine 
energies, 
so 
system 
energies 
are 
discrete 
and 
in 
series: 
E0, 
E1, 
E2, 
and 
so 
on. 
Energy-level 
differences 
are 
quanta 
that 
are 
functions 
of 
fundamental 
frequency. 


Because 
energy 
has 
quanta, 
momentum 
and 
angular 
momentum 
(including 
spin) 
have 
quanta. 
Electron 
experiments 
have 
determined 
the 
angular-momentum 
quantum 
unit 
to 
be 
h-bar 
/ 
(2)^0.5. 
Momentum 
has 
quantum: 
h 
/ 
(phase-space 
wave 
wavelength). 
Energy 
has 
quantum: 
h 
* 
(phase-space 
wave 
frequency). 
Electron 
experiments 
have 
determined 
that 
action 
has 
quanta, 
so 
energy 
times 
time, 
and 
momentumtimesdistance,havequanta. 


Because 
a 
continuous 
quantity 
times 
a 
discontinuous 
quantity 
would 
make 
a 
continuous 
quantity, 
for 
action 
to 
have 
quanta, 
time 
and 
length 
must 
have 
quanta. 
The 
quantum-mechanical 
uncertainty 
principle 
depends 
on 
particle-wave 
properties, 
relates 
indeterminacies 
in 
particle 
energy

time 
(or 
momentum 
and

and 
so 
relates

by

Bellexperiment 


To 
show 
directly 
that 
physics 
is 
non-local, 
measure 
entangled-electron 
spins 
{Bell 
experiment}. 
Electrons 
are 
indistinguishable. 
Around 
any 
measuring 
axis, 
electron 
spins 
have 
only 
two, 
clockwise 
or 
counterclockwise, 
angular-momentum 
states. 
For 
systems 
with 
zero 
total 
angular 
momentum, 
one 
electron 
has 
spin 
+1/2 
and 
the 
other 
has 
spin 
-1/2. 
Experimenters 
can 
only 
measure 
one 
electron's 
spin, 
after 
wavefunction 
collapse, 
so 
system 
wavefunction 
before 
collapse 
had 
both 
electrons 
having 
both 
spins 
in 
superposition. 
Electrons 
1 
and 
2 
have 
spins 
along 
axes 
x, 
y, 
and 
z. 
If 
axes 
are 
indistinguishable 
and 
electrons 
combine 
randomly, 
states 
are 
1x+2x-, 
1x-2x+; 
1x+2y-, 
1x-2y+; 
1x+2z-, 
1x-2z+; 
1y+2y-, 
1y-2y+; 
1y+2z-, 
1y-2z+; 
1z+2z-, 
1z-2z+, 
so 
6/12 
of 
states 
involve 
x-axis, 
and 
6/12 
do 
not. 
If 
axes 
are 
distinguishable 
and 
electrons 
combine 
randomly, 
states 
are 
1x+2x-, 
1x-2x+; 
1x+2y-, 
1x-2y+; 
1x+2z-, 
1x-2z+; 
1y+2x-, 
1y-2x+; 
1y+2y-, 
1y-2y+; 
1y+2z-, 
1y-2z+; 
1z+2x-, 
1z-2x+; 
1z+2y-, 
1z-2y+; 
1z+2z-, 
1z-2z+, 
so 
10/18 
of 
states 
involve 
x-axis, 
and 
8/18 
do 
not. 
However, 
system 
has 
equal 
probability 
to 
start 
with 
1x+2x-and 
1x-2x+, 
so 
2 
x-axis 
states 
must 
be 
left 
out, 
making 
9/18 
of 
states 
involve 
x-axis, 
and 
9/18 
do 
not. 
If 
axes 
are 
indistinguishable 
and 
electrons 
entangle, 
states 
are 
xx, 
xy, 
xz, 
yy, 
yz, 
zz, 
so 
3/6 
of 
states 
involve 
x-axis, 
and 
3/6 
do 
not. 
If 
axes 
are 
distinguishable 
and 
electrons 
entangle, 
states 
are 
xx, 
xy, 
yx, 
xz, 
zx, 
yy, 
yz, 
zy, 
zz, 
so 
5/9 
of 
states 
involve 
x-axis, 
and 
4/9 
do 
not. 
Bell 
experiment 
result 
confirms 
the 
last 
conditions, 
so, 
if 
there 
are 
no 
hidden 
variables, 
electrons 
entangle, 
and 
physics 
is

In 
classical 
physical 
space, 
particles 
have 
definite 
positions 
and 
momenta, 
not 
probabilities 
of 
positions 
and 
momenta. 
If 
physical 
space 
has 
no 
external 
forces, 
positions 
and 
momenta 
are 
independent. 
If 
physical 
space 
has 
force 
fields, 
position 
change 
changes 
momentum 
in 
only 
one 
way, 
according 
to 
energy 
conservation. 
Because 
particles 
have 
definite 
positions 
and 
momenta, 
and 
classical 
configuration 
space 
has 
only 
real 
numbers, 
classical 
configuration 
space 
has 
no 
real-number/imaginarynumber 
interactions 
and 
so 
no 
waves. 
The 
Hamiltonian 
function 
represents 
energy 
as 
a 
function 
of 
momentum(kinetic 
energy)andspace 
(potentialenergy)coordinates. 


In 
quantum-mechanical 
physical 
space, 
particles 
have 
probabilities 
of 
positions 
and 
momenta. 
Quantum-mechanical 
physical 
space 
has

but

and

have 
complex 
numbers. 
Exponentials 
with 
complex-number 
exponents 
represent 
cosine 
and 
sine

(Maxwell's

Electromagnetic 
waves 
are 
vector

because 
electric 
and 
magnetic 
forces

fields 
have 
direction, 
electromagnetic 
waves 
propagate 
in 
a 
direction, 
and 
energy 
travels 
in 
that 
direction. 
Matter 
waves 
are 
scalar, 
because 
they 
are 
not 
about 
forces 
or

have 
no

Matter

Waves

In 
quantum

unlike 
classical 
mechanics, 
momentum 
and

Large 
objects 
have 
high 
matter-wave 
frequencies. 
At 
high 
frequencies, 
matter-wave 
properties 
are 
undetectable, 
because 
wavelengths 
are 
too 
small, 
so 
classical 
mechanics 
applies. 
Small 
objects 
have 
lowmatter-wavefrequencies,so

Resonating 
waves 
have 
fundamental 
frequency 
and 
harmonic 
overtones. 
Particles 
have 
matter 
waves 
with 
harmonic 
frequencies. 
Harmonic 
frequencies 
correspond 
to 
a 
series 
of 
positions 
or 
energy/momentumlevels,separated 
by 
equalamounts(quantum). 


Waves 
change 
frequency 
without 
passing 
through 
intermediate 
frequencies. 
No 
intermediate 
frequencies 
means 
no 
intermediate 
positions 
or 
energies/momenta. 
Matter 
waves 
explain 
why 
particles 
have 
discrete 
energy 
levels, 
separated 
by 
quanta, 
and 
why, 
during 
energy-level 
transitions, 
particles 
never 
have 
in-between 
energy 
levels. 
Particles 
also 
have 
discrete 
locations, 
separated 
by 
quantum 
distances. 


physical 
systems 


In 
free 
space, 
particle 
matter 
waves 
have 
a 
small 
range 
of 
frequencies 
and 
superpose 
to 
make 
a 
wave 
packet. 
Particle 
systems 
superpose 
particle 
matter 
waves 
to 
make 
system 
matter 
waves. 
Noninteracting 
particles 
have 
dependent 
matter 
waves 
that 
add 
non-linearly 
(entangle). 
In 
atoms 
and 
molecules, 
electrons, 
neutrons, 
and 
protons 
have 
phase-space 
matter 
waves 
that 
represent 
transitions 
among 
atomic 
orbits. 


Electrons 
cannot 
be 
near 
nucleus, 
because 
then 
electron 
matter-wave 
interacts 
with 
proton 
matter-wave,and 
atomcollapses. 


philosophy 


Perhaps, 
matter 
waves 
are 
particles, 
only 
associate 
with

are

tunneling 


In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
matter-wave 
amplitude 
determines 
probability 
that 
particle 
is 
at 
that 
position. 
Matter 
waves 
are 
infinite 
and 
so 
have 
positive 
amplitude 
at 
all 
space 
points. 
Therefore, 
unlike 
classical 
mechanics, 
particles 
haveaprobabilityofbeing 
outside 
potential-energy 
barriers{tunneling}|. 


At 
barriers, 
particle 
waves 
reflect 
back 
or 
refract 
through. 
Particles 
with 
higher 
matter-wave 
frequency 
and 
more 
energy 
have 
more 
refraction. 
As

Because

an

Wavefunctions

Wavefunctions

However,

Experiments

For

but 
not

by

Though

simultaneously, 
after

instruments

After

the 
two

have 
specific

By 
manipulating 
properties 
at 
particle

and 
at

experimenters 
can 
transfer 
particle 
properties 
to 
far-away

though 
the 
particles 
have 
no 
physical 
connection 
at 
collapse 
time. 
All 
physical 
communication 
happens 
when 
the 
particles 
interact. 
All 
physical 
laws 
require 
local

which 
result 
in

curvatures.

spin 


In 
classical 
mechanics, 
spin 
around 
axis 
has 
no 
components 
along 
orthogonal 
axes, 
only 
along 
non-orthogonal 
axes. 
For

spin 
around 
x-axis 
has 
measurable 
component 
on 
xy-axis 
but 
not 
on 
y-axisor

In 
quantum

observers 
can

on 
any

and 
electron 
spin 
has 
the 
same 
angular-momentum

either

or 
counterclockwise. 
Electron

and 
to 
have

In

if

with 
spin 
around 
x-axis, 
observers 
can 
measure 
spin 
around

or 
around

because

but

and 
z-axis 
are 
orthogonal 
to 
x-axis 
and

On

Particles 
have 
wavefunctions, 
so 
measurements 
are 
about 
wave 
packets. 
As

wave 
properties 


Uncertainty 
follows 
from 
wave 
properties, 
because 
wave 
position 
and 
momentum, 
or 
time 
and 
energy, 
inversely 
relate. 
Energy 
and 
momentum 
depend 
on 
wave 
frequency. 
Position 
and 
time 
depend 
on 
wave 
amplitude. 
Measuring 
wave 
frequency 
or 
wavelength 
precisely 
prevents 
measuring 
wave 
amplitude 
precisely. 
Measuring 
wave

precisely 
prevents

If

position

momentum 
must 
be 
uncertain. 
If

At 
space 
points, 
wavefunctions 
that 
have 
high 
amplitude 
have 
precise 
position 
and 
timing. 
However, 
wavefunction 
slope 
is 
steep, 
so 
amplitude 
change 
between 
nearby 
points 
is 
large, 
so 
velocity 
change,momentumchange, 
and

are 
largeandso

at 
that 
position. 
SeeFigure1. 


Wavefunctions 
with 
wide 
wave 
packets 
have 
large 
uncertainty. 
Wavefunction 
slopes 
are 
not 
steep, 
and 
amplitude 
change 
at 
nearby 
points 
is 
small, 
so 
velocity 
change, 
momentum 
change, 
and 
energy 
change 
are 
small 
in 
that 
region. 
Momentum 
is 
precise,

Alternatively,energyisprecise,whiletiming

To

confinement 


By 
uncertainty 
principle, 
particles 
confined 
to 
smaller 
regions 
or 
times 
have 
greater 
momentum 
and 
energy. 
In 
confined 
regions, 
even 
in 
vacuum, 
energy 
is 
high, 
allowing 
particle 
creation 
and 
annihilation. 


matrices 


In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
particle 
position 
and 
momentum 
are 
quantized 
and 
so 
are 
matrices 
(not 



scalars 
or 
vectors), 
with 
complex-number 
elements. 
Because 
particles 
have 
probabilities 
of 
being 
anywhere 
in 
space, 
matrix 
rows 
and 
columns 
have 
infinite 
numbers 
of 
elements, 
and 
matrices 
are 
square 
matrices. 
In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
position 
and 
momentum 
are 
not 
necessarily 
independent, 
but 
dependonthewhole 
particle 
system. 


Matrices 
represent 
electronic 
transitions 
between 
energy 
levels. 
Matrix 
rows 
are 
one 
energy 
level, 
and 
matrix 
columns 
are 
the 
other 
energy 
level. 
Matrix 
elements 
represent 
the 
probability 
of 
that 
electronic 
transition. 
Matrix 
elements 
are 
periodic 
to 
represent 
the 
possible 
quanta. 
The 
diagonal 
represents 
transitions 
between 
the 
same 
energy 
level 
and 
so 
has 
value 
zero. 
Near 
the 
diagonal 
represents 
transitions 
between 
adjacent 
energy 
levels 
and 
so 
has 
higher 
values. 
Far 
from 
the

represents 
transitions 
between 
non-adjacent 
energy 
levels 
and 
so

Therefore,

energy 


By 
uncertainty 
principle, 
particles 
must 
move, 
and 
so 
they 
cannot 
have 
zero 
energy. 
Particles 
cannot 
have 
zero 
energy 
because 
they 
cannot 
have 
zero 
motion, 
because 
that 
violates

of

Electron

In

Electron

In

is

as

Electron

In

From 
lowest 
orbital, 
electrons 
cannot 
go 
to 
lower 
orbits, 
because 
there 
are 
no 
lower 
energy 
levels. 
They 
cannot 
lose 
more 
energy, 
because 
if

decreases 
then 
time 
increases,

principle, 
making

They

In 
quantum

In

At

The

energy 
to 
total 
energy, 
has 
complex-number, 
single-valued, 
continuous, 
and 
finite 
solutions 
{wavefunction}|. 
The 
wave 
equation, 
and 
its 
wavefunction 
solutions, 
are 
about 
abstract 
phase 
space, 
which 
includes 
space-
time 
and 
describes 
system 
momenta 
and 
position 
or 
energy 
and 
time 
states. 
Wavefunctions 
represent 
possible 
physical-system 
energy 
levels 
and 
positions, 
and 
their 
probabilities. 
Wavefunctions 
correlate 
particle 
energies 
and 
times 
or 
particle 
momenta 
and 
positions. 
Wavefunctions 
typically 
depend 
on 
position, 
because 
energy 
includes 
potential 
energy. 
Wavefunctions 
typically 
depend 
on 
time, 
because 
energy 
includes

Wavefunctions 
are 
not 
physical

and 
have 
no

or

Wavefunction

Because 
particle 
matter 
waves 
resonate 
in 
physical 
systems, 
wavefunctions 
have 
fundamental 
frequency 
and 
harmonics 
of 
fundamental

System

depend 
on 
wavefunction

System

Wavefunction 
amplitudes 
are 
complex

that 
reflect 
physical-system 
position, 
time, 
energy, 
or

relations. 
Probabilities 
that 
particles 
are 
at 
locations 
depend 
on 
wavefunction 
amplitude 
for 
that 
location. 
Probabilities 
are 
linear 
and 
add, 
so 
probability 
of 
a 
set 
of 
states 
is 
sum 
of 
stateprobabilities. 
Wavefunctionamplitudes 
cannormalize, 
sosumofallstateprobabilitiesis

Intensity 
is 
absolute 
value 
of 
wavefunction-amplitude 
squared: 
wavefunction 
complex 
conjugate 
times 
position 
vector 
times 
wavefunction. 
Squared 
amplitude 
eliminates 
imaginary 
numbers 
and 
so 
is 
only 
real 
numbers. 
Absolute 
value 
makes 
only 
positive 
numbers. 
Intensities 
and 
energies 
are 
only 
discrete 
real 
positive

(eigenvalue). 
Amplitude 
squared

Waves 
have

and 
so

Particles

alternatives:undefinedand

Perhaps, 
particles 
have 
no 
wavefunction, 
so 
there 
is 
no 
collapse. 
Instead 
of 
wavefunctions, 
particles 
have 
only 
defined 
and 
undefined 
states. 
Undefined 
states 
can 
become 
one 
defined 
state. 
For 
example, 
particle 
density 
matrices 
represent 
possible 
different-probability 
physical 
states. 
Particle 
moves 
from 
undefined 
states 
to 
one 
state 
on 
the

diagonal. 
However, 
particles 
can 
be 
in 
superposed

which 
matrices 
cannot 
represent. 
Particles 
can 
have 
only

or 
two

whichmatricescannotrepresent. 


alternatives:subquanta 


Perhaps, 
quantum 
levels 
involve 
even 
smaller 
properties, 
or 
quantities 
that 
cause 
them. 
However,

havenohidden

alternatives:largerwhole 


Perhaps, 
physics 
has 
another 
conservation 
law 
about 
a 
larger 
whole. 
Observers 
and 
instruments 
measure 
only 
observable 
parts, 
while 
other 
parts 
are 
not 
observable. 
Whole 
system, 
observable 
and 
not

is 
deterministic, 
continuous, 
and 
time 
symmetric. 
For

always

at

but

are

and 
some 
are

However,

alternatives:twostate 
vectors 


Perhaps, 
quantum 
states 
have 
two 
phase-space 
state 
vectors, 
one 
starting 
from 
last 
wavefunction 
collapse 
and 
going 
forward 
in 
time 
and 
the 
other 
starting 
from 
next 
wavefunction

and 
going 
backward 
in 
time 
(Yakir 
Aharonov, 
Lev 
Vaidman, 
Costa 
de 
Beauregard, 
Paul 
Werbos) 
[1989]. 
Before 
and 
after 
phase-spaces 
are 
different. 
At 
events, 
forward-state

first, 
and 
then 
backwardstatevector 
happens. 
Their 
vectorproductmakes 
density 
matrices, 
allowingsmoothtransitionsbetween 
wavefunctions 
and

This 
theory 
gives 
same 
results 
as 
quantum 
mechanics 
with 
one 
state 
vector. 
Forward 
and 
backward 
effects 
allow 
consistency 
with 
general 
relativity. 
However, 
time 
cannot 
flowbackward,bygeneral 
relativity. 


alternatives:positivism 


Perhaps, 
only 
measured 
results 
count, 
and 
wavefunctions 
are 
non-measurable 
things. 
However, 



experiments 
involving 
primitive 
measurements 
demonstrate 
that 
quantum

deterministic 
and

Entangled 
particle 
wavefunctions 
depend 
on 
each

maintain 
phase 
relations, 
and 
have 
coherence. 
In 
isolated 
systems 
with 
entangled 
particle 
wavefunctions, 
system 
wavefunction 
continues 
to 
evolve 
deterministically. 
In 
non-isolated

with 
entangled 
particle 
wavefunctions, 
measurements, 
absorptions,

electromagnetic

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosenexperiment 


Spin-zero-particle

two

spin-1/2 
particles, 
one

and 
one 
-1/2, 
which 
have 
one 
coherent 
system 
wavefunction 
{Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

{EPR

After 
particle-pair 
production, 
one 
particle 
always 
has 
spin 
opposite 
to 
the 
first, 
by 
conservation 
of 
angular 
momentum, 
but 
observation 
has 
not 
yet 
determined 
which 
particle 
has 
which 
spin. 
If 
an 
instrument 
detects 
one 
particle's 
spin 
direction 
and 
collapses 
the 
system 
wavefunction, 
the 
other 
particle 
immediately 
has 
the 
opposite 
spin, 
even 
over 
long 
distances. 
Einstein, 
Podolsky, 
and 
Rosen 
said 
instantaneous 
information 
transmission 
was 
impossible, 
so 
particles 
changed 
to 
the 
measured 
spins 
when 
the 
particles 
separated. 
Experiments 
showed 
that 
both 
particles 
have 
no 
definite 
spin 
until 
measured, 
so 
particles 
had 
superposed 
states 
until 
measured. 
By 
quantum 
mechanics, 
neither 
particle 
has 
definite 
spin-axis 
direction, 
so 
particles 
have 
superposition 
of 
+1/2 
and 
-1/2 
states 
until

Experimenters 
must 
choose 
direction 
around 
which 
to 
measure 
spin 
and 
can 
measure 
in 
any 
direction. 
If 
they 
measure 
opposite 
direction, 
they 
can 
observe 
opposite 
spin. 
Therefore, 
particle

alone 
does 
not 
determine

observable 
inmeasurement 


For 
objective 
measurement, 
events 
{observable} 
must 
be 
independent 
of 
where 
or 
when 
they 
happen. 
Objectivemeasurementscannot 
be 
functions 
ofspace 
ortimecoordinates. 


Measurements 
need 
reference 
points, 
such 
as 
x=0, 
and 
measurement 
units, 
such 
as 
meter. 
By 
relativity, 
objective 
measurementscannotbefunctionsof 
referencepoints 
orunits. 


Measured 
state 
is 
orthogonal 
to 
all 
other 
possible 
states, 
because 
if 
one 
state 
happens, 
others 
do 
not. 
Measuredstatecanbealong

Measurements 
in 
systems 
with 
no 
waves, 
or 
with 
waves 
with 
no 
phase 
differences, 
can 
have 
any 
order 
{commuting 
measurement}. 
Primitive 
measurements 
commute, 
because 
they 
are 
notabout 
phase, 
only 
about 
yes 
or 
no. 
Measurements 
in 
systems 
with 
waves 
and 
phase 
differences 
depend 
on 
sequence 
{non-commuting 
measurement}. 
Most 
measurements 
do 
not 
commute, 
because 
they 
find 
value 
or 
probability. 


subjectivemeasurement 


In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
time 
and 
space 
are 
not 
continuous 
but 
have 
quanta. 
In 
phase 
space, 
momenta 
relate 
to 
positions, 
and 
energies 
relate 
to 
times, 
so 
events 
are 
functions 
of 
space 
and 
time 
coordinates. 
Because 
positions 
and 
lengths 
relate 
to 
momenta, 
events 
are 
functions 
of 
reference 
points 
and 
units. 
Objective 
measurement 
is 
not 
possible. 
Quantum 
mechanics 
has 
only 
subjective 
measurement. 


interaction 


To 
measure 
particle 
size, 
light 
must 
have 
wavelength 
less 
than 
particle 
diameter 
and 
so 
high 
frequency 
and 
energy. 
High 
energy 
can 
change 
particle 
momentum. 
Higher 
energy 
increases 
momentumuncertainty. 


To 
measure 
particle 
momentum, 
light 
must 
have 
low 
energy, 
to 
avoid 
deflecting 
particle, 
and 
so 
longwavelength. 
Longerwavelengthincreaseslocationuncertainty. 
Measuring 
position 
requires 
different-frequency 
light 
wave 
than 
measuring

so 
experimentscannotfind

Schršdinger 
equations 
are 
about 
particle 
energy-level 
transitions. 
Particle 
can 
go 
from 
one 
energy 
level 
to 
another 
along 
infinitely 
many 
paths. 
For 
example, 
particle 
can 
go 
directly 
from 
one 
energy 
level 
to 
another 
{direct 
channel} 
or 
go 
to 
higher 
energy 
level 
and 
then 
drop 
down 
to 
lower 
energy 
level 
{cross 
channel}. 
Particles 
have 
matter 
waves, 
and 
each 
transition 
changes 
matter 
waves 
to 
a 
different 
frequency. 
Forcrosschannels, 
net

is 
superposition 
ofmatter-wave 
transitions. 


transitions: 
probability 


Going 
from 
one 
energy 
level 
to 
another 
has 
a 
probability 
that 
depends 
on 
energy 
difference 
and 
starting 
energy. 
Schršdinger-equation 
wavefunction 
solutions 
have 
transition 
complex-number 
amplitudes. 
For 
cross 
channels, 
total 
amplitude 
is 
complex-number 
sum 
of 
all 
transition 
amplitudes. 
Transition 
probabilities 
are 
absolute 
values 
of 
squared 
amplitudes. 
Squaring 
complex 
numbers 
makes 
real 
numbers. 
Absolute 
values 
make 
positive 
numbers. 
Therefore, 
transition 
probabilities 
are 
positive 
real

transitions: 
renormalization 


Because 
number 
of 
paths 
is 
infinite, 
transition-probability 
sum 
seems 
infinite. 
However, 
higher 
frequencies 
have 
lower 
probabilities, 
so

If

they

Past

they

then 
all

Both

Therefore,

can 
be

For

In

Particle 
positions

dimensions, 
because 
particles

In 
classical 
physical

a

To 
simplify, 
assume 
one 
particle 
and 
that 
the 
y-axis 
and 
z-axis 
positions 
and

are 
zero, 
so 
configuration

x-axis 
perpendicular

Assume 
that 
one

moves 
in 
the

along 
the

For 
no

and 
so 
constant 
momentum, 
configuration

has 
a

For 
constant 
external

in 
the 
positive

along 
the 
x-axis 
and 
so 
increasing 
momentum, 
configuration

has 
a 
straight-line 
trajectory 
with 
positive 
slope 
to 
the

For 
two

under 
the

conditions, 
configuration

fourindependent

two

To 
account 
for

and

configuration

have 
three

In

positions

have 
three 
complex-number

Configuration

has 
six 
dimensions 
for 
each 
particle, 
but 
each 
dimension 
has 
two

components: 
real 
and 
imaginary. 
If 
particles 
interact, 
particle 
dimensions 
are 
not

For

In

For

For

Relativity

Space-time

and

By 
uncertainty 
principle 
and 
complementarity 
principle, 
relativistic 
space-time 
and 
quantum-mechanics 
space-time 
are 
not 
compatible. 
In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
space-time 
is 
one 
history 
in 
superspace, 
with 
all 
possible 
histories 
inside, 
which 
all 
interact 
to 
give 
actual 
space-time. 
Space-time

From 
far 
away, 
fluids 
and 
crystals 
are 
continuous 
as 
in

but 
from 
nearby 
they 
are 
discrete 
as 
in

at

ground-state 
energy. 
Sound 
waves 
must 
have 
wavelength 
longer 
than 
distance 
between 
molecules. 
Hawking-effect 
photons 
start 
with 
wavelength 
less 
than 
black-hole 
diameter. 
Gravity 
pulls 
emitted 
photons, 
so 
wavelengthbecomes 
longer. 


fluid:lowtemperature 


At 
near-zero 
temperature, 
sounds 
can 
have 
phonon 
quanta. 
Flow 
changes 
are 
slow 
compared 
to 
molecular 
changes, 
so 
phonons 
have 
ground-state 
energy. 
In 
non-accelerating 
fluid, 
wavelength, 



frequency, 
and 
speed 
stay 
constant. 
In 
accelerating 
fluid, 
wavelength 
and 
speed 
increase. 
As 
wavelength 
approaches 
distance 
between 
molecules, 
molecular 
interactions 
cause 
speed 
in 
different 
fluids 
to 
differ. 
If 
speed 
stays 
constant 
{Type 
I 
behavior}, 
quantum 
effects 
do 
not 
matter. 
If 
speed 
decreases 
{Type 
II 
behavior}, 
phonons 
just 
outside 
event 
horizon 
can 
go 
below 
horizon 
speed 
and 
first 
fall 
in 
but 
then 
go 
out. 
If 
speed 
increases

Particles 
with 
integral 
electric

have 
no

because 
their 
colors 
add 
to 
white 
or

Particles

have 
color, 
because 
their

not

white

For 
example, 
pions 
have 
up 
quark

down 
antiquark, 
so 
charge 
is 
-1 
(-2/3 
+ 
-1/3), 
and 
color 
and 
complementary 
color 
add

Protons 
have 
two

one 
down

so 
charge 
adds

(+2/3

and

Fractional-charge

For

Quantum

three

Paths

Electrons 
{quasiparticle,

move

Electrons

Electrons 
{Dirac

moving

they

that

In

String

can 
vibrate 
in

travel 
around

Winding 
around 
large

takes 
more

because

Moving

In

and 
go 
around

{winding

They 
can 
go

more 
than 
once. 
Curled-up 
dimensions 
cannot 
be 
smaller 
and 
their 
vibrations 
have 
a

so 
waves 
have 
quantum

spatialdimensions:size 


Curled-up 
dimensions 
have 
two 
radii, 
one

Because

if

Winding-mode

Dimensional

Because 
winding

curled-up

A 


Phase 
spaces 
can 
show 
results 
of 
non-commutative 
operations 
{non-commutative 
geometry, 



Connes} 
and 
so 
represent 
non-commutative 
algebras. 
For 
example, 
space 
rotations 
are 
non-
commutative. 
Phase 
spaces 
representing 
quantum 
effects 
are 
non-commutative. 
Geometry 
can 
be 
non-
commutative 
if 
axes 
are 
different, 
rather 
than 
equivalent. 
Cross 
products 
are 
non-commutative. 
His 
non-commutative 
phase 
space 
can 
represent 
all 
elementary 
particle 
symmetry 
groups. 
This 
space 
has 
two 
continuous 
spaces, 
which 
have 
bosons, 
linked 
by 
discrete 
non-commutative 
space, 
which 
has 
Higgs 
particles, 
predicted 
to 
have 
mass 
of 
160 
GeV. 
Using 
this

defines 
what 
renormalization

mathematically, 
rather 
than 
it 
looking

with 
Dirk

Perhaps, 
space 
has 
fractional

related

gravitation. 
Gravity 
has

Epistemology 


Physical 
laws 
are 
the 
same 
whether 
one 
is 
standing 
still 
or 
moving. 
Knowledge 
is 
about 
mathematical 
motion 
laws 
and 
motion 
relations, 
not 
about 
Forms 
or 
Being. 
Mathematics 
and 
measurement 
are 
for 
mechanics 
and 
experiments, 
not 
just 
for 
formal 
geometry 
and 
number 
theory. 
Experiments 
must 
simplify 
situation 
to 
allow 
measurement.

In
