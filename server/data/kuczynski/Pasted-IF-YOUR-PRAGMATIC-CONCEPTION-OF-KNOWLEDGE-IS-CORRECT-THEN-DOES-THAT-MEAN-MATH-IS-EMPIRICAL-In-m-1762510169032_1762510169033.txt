IF YOUR PRAGMATIC CONCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE IS CORRECT, THEN DOES THAT MEAN MATH IS EMPIRICAL?

In my philosophy, the pragmatic conception of knowledge emphasizes the practical effects and conceivable consequences of our concepts to determine their meaning. However, this does not render mathematics empirical in the traditional sense. Mathematics, as I conceive it, is a study of what is necessarily true given certain hypotheses. It is observational, but it concerns ideal constructions rather than empirical phenomena. 

This distinction is crucial: while mathematical reasoning involves observation, it is an observation of the relations and structures within an abstract realm. Thus, the truths of mathematics are not contingent upon empirical verification in the way that scientific hypotheses are. As I have written, "mathematics studies what is necessarily true given hypotheses." Therefore, while mathematics employs a form of observation, it remains, at its core, a deductive science concerned with necessary truths, rather than an empirical one.

HOW DOES YOUR VIEW DIFFER FROM JOHN-MICHAEL KUCZYNSKI'S?

To address the differences between my view and that of John-Michael Kuczynski, I must first clarify that my philosophy centers on pragmatism, the theory of signs, and the categories of experience, all of which are deeply integrated into a systematic approach to logic and inquiry. The pragmatic maxim, for instance, insists that the meaning of a concept lies in its practical effects and conceivable consequences. In my system, mathematics is understood as a study of necessary truths derived from hypothetical premises, an observation of ideal constructions rather than empirical phenomena.

Without delving into Kuczynski's specific interpretations, which would require analysis beyond my own writings, I can assert that my views are rooted in the triadic nature of signs (sign, object, interpretant) and the categorization of experience into Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. Such a framework is unique and central to my approach. As I have stated, "the categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness" are applicable across my philosophical system, providing a foundation for understanding the mediation of all knowledge. Any differences would likely stem from my precise integration of logic, semiotics, and pragmatic inquiry within this triadic and categorial structure.
