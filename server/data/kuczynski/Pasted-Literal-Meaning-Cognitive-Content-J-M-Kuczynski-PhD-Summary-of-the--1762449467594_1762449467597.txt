The 
present 
work 
concerns 
the 
relationship 
between 
word-meaning 
and 
thought-content. 
Volume 
I 
of 
this 
two 
volume 
work 
concerns 
word-
meaning, 
and 
Volume 
II 
concerns 
thought-content. 


Summary 
of 
Volume 
I: 
It 
is 
made 
clear 
what 
it 
is 
for 
a 
given 
linguistic 
expression 
E 
to 
have 
a 
given 
meaning 
M, 
and 
it 
is 
thereby 
made 
clear 
exactly 
how 
a 
given 
sentence’s 
meaning 
depends 
on 
this 
meanings 
of 
its 
parts 
is 
made. 
Further, 
the 
Fregean 
thesis 
that 
‘grammatical 
surface-structure 
may 
diverge 
from 
logical 
form’ 
is 
evaluated. 


It 
is 
shown 
that 
Frege’s 
thesis 
is 
correct 
only 
in 
relation 
to 
erroneous 
views 
as 
to 
the 
semantics 
of 
quantifiers 
and 
intensional 
operators. 
It 
is 
clearly 
stated 
what 
such 
expressions 
actually 
mean, 
and 
on 
this 
basis 
it 
is 
shown 
that, 
pace 
Frege, 
logical 
and 
grammatical 
form 
do 
in 
fact 
coalesce---as 
they 
obviously 
must, 
given 
that, 
after 
allowances 
are 
made 
for 
the 
relatively 
small 
number 
of 
expression-specific 
linguistic 
rules 
that 
one 
can 
learn, 
sentences 
are 
intelligible 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
surface-structure 
mirrors 
logical 
form. 


Most 
importantly, 
it 
is 
said 
exactly 
what 
linguistic 
meanings 
are; 
and 
on 
this 
basis 
it 
is 
clearly 
stated 
how 
a 
complex 
(composite) 
expression’s 
grammatical 
structure 
maps 
onto 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
meaning 
encoded 
in 
that 
expression. 


On 
this 
basis, 
a 
demonstrably 
correct 
solution 
is 
put 
forth 
to 
Frege’s 
paradox 
concerning 
the 
"unity 
of 
the 
proposition." 
This 
paradox 
is 
given 
by 
the 
prima 
facie 
cogent 
point 
that, 
because 
no 
string 
of 
nouns 
constitutes 
a 
sentence 
(except 
in 
relation 
to 
linguistic 
conventions 
that 
assign 
phonetically 
unrealized 
semantic 
structure 
to 
what 
would 
otherwise 
be 
strings 
of 
nouns) 
, 
it 
follows 
that, 
for 
any 
admissible 
values 
of 
"a" 
and 
"PHI", 
the 
occurrence 
in 
"a 
has 
PHI" 
of 
"PHI" 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
PHI 
. 
(Explanation 
"Smith 
runs 
fast" 
is 
meaningful, 
but 
"Smith, 
the 
property 
of 
running 
fast" 
is 
not 
meaningful, 
the 



latter 
being 
meaningless 
expression 
whole 
that 
contains 
meaningful 
parts. 


Summary 
of 
Volume 
II: 
It 
is 
made 
clear 
what 
it 
is 
for 
a 
given 
person 
(or 
creature 
of 
any 
kind) 
have 
a 
concept 
of 
a 
given 
object. 
Russell-Frege 
descriptivism 
is 
proven 
correct; 
i.e. 
it 
is 
shown 
that 
person 
for 
person 
S 
to 
have 
concept 
of 
object 
O 
is 
for 
S 
to 
know 
some 
truth 
of 
the 
form 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
has 
PHI 
1... 
PHIn, 
where 
O 
and 
O 
alone 
has 
all 
of 
PHI 
1... 
PHIn. 
In 
others 


words, 
for 
S 
to 
have 
a 
concept 
of 
O 
is 
for 
S 
to 
know 
some 
truth 
that 
singles 
O 
out. 
But 
this 
is 
only 
a 
necessary, 
as 
opposed 
to 
a 
sufficient, 
condition 
for 
S’s 
having 
knowledge 
of 
O: 
it 
is 
also 
necessary 
that 
PHI 
1... 
PHIn 
be 
such 
that 


they 
relativize 
O 
to 
S’s 
cognitive 
map, 
meaning 
that, 
in 
virtue 
of 
knowing 
the 


truth 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
has 
PHI 
1... 
PHIn, 
S 
has 
knowledge 
of 
a 
truth 
that 
not 
only 
singles 
out 
O, 
but 
singles 
out 
O 
in 
a 
way 
in 
which 
it 
is 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
singled 
out 
for 
any 
other 
creature. 
(This 
important 
truth 
is 
neither 
stated 
nor 
defended 
in 
the 
present 
work, 
but 
it 
is 
stated 
and 
thoroughly 
defended 
in 
Conceptual 
Atomism 
and 
the 
Computational 
Theory 
of 
Mind, 
written 
one 
year 
after 
the 
present 
treatise.) 


The 
tiny 
kernel 
of 
truth 
in 
the 
otherwise 
disastrously 
misconceived 
‘photograph-theory’ 
of 
conception 
(viz. 
the 
relation 
between 
S 
and 
O, 
where 
S 
has 
a 
concept 
of 
O, 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
relation 
between 
a 
photograph 
and 
the 
thing 
photographed) 
is 
that, 
when 
S 
has 
a 
concept 
of 
O, 
it 
is 
partly 
because 
S 
Burge-style 
externalism 
is 
shown 
to 
embody 
a 
failure 
to 
distinguish 
between 
word-meaning 
and 
thought 
content. 
And 
it 
is 
shown 
that 
given 
a 
correct 
understanding 
of 
the 
distinction 
between 
the 
two, 
the 
relevant 
data 
can 
modeled 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
validate 
our 
pretheoretic 
intuitions 
as 
well 
as 
the 
presumptions 
of 
empirical 
science. 


The 
model 
put 
forth, 
and 
vociferously 
defended, 
by 
Tyler 
Burge 
does 
not 
satisfy 
these 
desiderata. 
Specifically, 
Burge’s 
analysis 
entails 
that: 


(i) 
Thoughts 
do 
nothing: 
the 
mental 
sphere 
is 
causally 
inert 
(and 
therefore 
non-existent, 
given 
that, 
where 
spatiotemporal 
entities 
are 
concerned, 
to 
exist 
is 
to 
have 
causal 
properties); 
(ii) 
If 
S 
has 
a 
belief 
about 
O, 
where 
O 
is 
some 
object 
in 
the 
external 
world 
(as 
opposed 
to 
an 
abstract 
entity, 
e.g. 
a 
number, 
or 
a 
sensation, 
e.g. 
a 
tickle, 
experienced 
by 
S), 
S 
cannot 
know 
himself 
to 
have 
that 
belief; 

(iii) 
The 
mind 
is, 
quite 
literally, 
spread 
out 
over 
space-
time: 
if 
you 
have 
a 
concept 
of 
a 
star 
that 
saw 
through 
a 
telescope 
but 
that 
went 
out 
of 
existence 
long-ago, 
it 
is 
because 
that 
star 
is 
an 
actual 
constituent---not 
an 
object, 
be 
it 
emphasized, 
but 
a 
component---of 
your 
mind. 
That 
(iii) 
is 
indeed 
a 
consequence 
of 
Burge’s 
position 
was 
proved 
in 
by 
Colin 
McGinn 
(1988). 


Of 
course, 
these 
consequences 
of 
Burge’s 
theory 
are 
totally 
absurd. 
Content-externalists 
have 
spent 
the 
last 
36 
years 
trying 
to 
show 
that 
(i)-(iii), 
along 
with 
the 
various 
other 
absurdities 
that 
follow 
from 
Burge’s 
theory, 
are 
either 
true 
(which 
they 
are 
not) 
or 
that 
they 
do 
not 
follow 
from 
Burge’s 
theory 
(which 
they 
do). 


Burge’s 
theory, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
various 
derivatives---e.g. 
Fodor’s 
atomism 
about 
concepts 
(viz. 
one’s 
concept 
of 
the 
number 
7 
has 
no 
logical 
or 
psychological 
complexity), 
which 
is 
an 
immediate 
consequence 
of 
the 
photograph-theory, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
an 
immediate 
consequence, 
if 
not 
the 
very 
essence, 
of 
Burge’s 
theory---are 
in 
each 
and 
every 
case 
shown 
to 
embody 
a 
failure 
to 
distinguish 
between 
literal 
meaning 
and 
cognitive 
content. 
And 
this 
failure 
is 
in 
its 
turn 
rooted 
in 
two 
failures: 


(i) 
A 
failure 
to 
understand 
literal 
meaning, 
and 
(ii) 
A 
failure 
to 
understand 
cognitive 
content. 
This 
book 
explains 


(1) 
What 
literal 
meaning 
is, 
(2) 
What 
cognitive 
content 
is, 
(3) 
How 
they 
differ, 
and 
(4) 
How 
they 
are 
related. 
General 
Points: 
This 
book 
is 
longer 
than 
it 
should 
be. 
(I 
wrote 
it 
when 
I 
was 
in 
graduate 
school, 
when 
I 
had 
a 
tendency 
to 
over-explain 
and 
also 
to 
over-focus 
on 
technicalities.) 


That 
said, 
most 
of 
the 
chapters 
in 
the 
present 
work 
are 
self-contained 
(even 
though 
they 
do 
collectively 
constitute 
a 
single, 
organic 
entity); 
and 
if 
a 



reader 
wishes 
to 
read 
the 
material 
on, 
for 
example, 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
proposition 
(Chapter 
16) 
or 
the 
nature 
of 
discourse 
about 
fictitious 
entities 
(Chapter 
25), 
he 
can 
skip 
right 
to 
the 
corresponding 
chapter. 


Apart 
from 
the 
defense 
of 
Montague-grammar 
(Chapter 
15) 
and 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
proposition 
(Chapter 
16), 
the 
material 
in 
Volume 
I 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
of 
little 
interest 
except 
to 
hyper-competent 
scholars 
who 
specialize 
in 
this 
particular 
subdiscipline. 
It 
addresses 
problems 
that, 
at 
the 
time 
I 
wrote 
the 
present 
treatise, 
were 
of 
great 
concern 
to 
the 
philosophical 
community 
(not 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
were 
concerned 
with, 
or 
able 
to 
ascertain, 
the 
truth 
about 
those 
problems, 
but 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
they 
were 
the 
foils-du-jour, 
whereby 
a 
quickly 
degenerating 
philosophical 
community 
attempted 
to 
appear 
to 
be 
philosophizing). 
And 
the 
reason 
they 
were 
of 
such 
concern 
is, 
I 
am 
afraid, 
that 
the 
average 
intelligence-level 
of 
philosophers 
in 
2005, 
though 
no 
lower 
than 
it 
is 
now, 
was 
inappropriately 
low. 
As 
a 
result, 
philosophical 
discourse, 
especially 
in 
semantics 
and 
philosophical 
logic, 
consisted 
of 
bitter 
debates 
concerning 
technical 
problems 
that 
were 
internal 
to 
the 
broken 
theories 
of 
the 
participants 
of 
those 
debates 
and 
were 
misunderstood 
even 
within 
those 
parameters. 


In 
Part 
I, 
Chapters 
1-10, 
those 
debates 
are 
adjudicated. 
After 
thus 
clearing 
the 
way 
of 
this 
philosophical 
debris, 
I 
proceed 
to 
deal 
with 
problems 
of 
real 
substance, 
for 
example: 


(i) 
The 
nature 
of 
meaning 
and 
truth 
(Chapter 
16) 
(ii) 
The 
nature 
of 
conception 
(Chapter 
18), 
and 
(iii) 
The 
semantics 
of 
fictitious 
statements 
(Chapters 
2526). 
The 
contents 
of 
Chapters 
1-10 
are 
concerned 
with 
the 
very 
same 
problems 
as 


*Keith 
Donnellan’s 
article 
"Reference 
and 
Quantification", 
the 
central 
thesis 
of 
which 
was 
plagiarized 
verbatim 
from 
A.J. 
Ayer’s 
(1956) 
book 
The 
Problem 
of 
Knowledge, 


*Kripke’s 
(1969) 
Naming 
and 
Necessity, 
which 
is 
little 
more 
than 
an 
exposition 
(sans 
acknowledgement 
of 
their 
progenitors) 
of 
points 
made 
in 
the 
late 
50s 
and 
early 
60s 
by

suggestively, 
were

he 
had 
died)

to 
a 
lesser 
extent,

(early 
60s)

on 
modal 
logic 
by 
Ruth 
Marcus, 


*David 
Kaplan’s 
(1989) 
Demonstratives, 
which 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
an 
exposition, 
sans 
acknowledgement 
of 
their 
progenitor, 
of 
ideas 
put 
forth 
in 
the 
50s 
by 
Peter 
Strawson 
(who, 
being 
a 
genuine 
philosopher, 
had 
broad 
interests 
and 
who, 
suggestively, 
distanced 
himself 
from 
anything 
having 
to 
do 
with 
the 
philosophy 
of 
language 
at 
about 
the 
time 
(late 
60s) 
that 
Kripke 
and 
Kaplan 
were 
becoming 
prominent),

great 
philosophical 
works

century,

with

integrated 
into 
an 
original 
epistemological 
system, 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
which 
is 
then 
established 
on 
independent 
grounds.

"Snow" 
refers 
to 
snow. 
"Nixon" 
refers 
to 
Nixon. 
In 
this 
work, 
it 
is 
shown 
that 
given 
a 
correct 
understanding 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
reference 
and 
of 
linguistic 
meaning 
generally, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
produce 
non-revisionist 
analyses 
of 
the 
nature 
of 


*Perceptual 
content, 
*Mental 
content 
generally, 
*Logical 
equivalence, 
*Logical 
dependence 
generally, 
*Counterfactual 
truth, 
*The 
causal 
efficacy 
of 
mental 
states, 



and 


*Our 
knowledge 
of

and 
of 
external 
world. 


In 
addition, 
set-theoretic 
interpretations 
of 
several 
semantic 
concepts 
are 
put 
forth. 
These 
concepts 
include 
truth, 
falsehood, 
negation, 
and 
conjunction. 


Given 
the 
doctrines 
put 
forth 
in 
this 
work, 
many 
puzzles 
of 
a 
logicosemantic 
nature 
are 
readily 
solved. 
One 
class 
of 
puzzles 
concerns 
statements 
about 
non-entities 
(e.g. 
the 
positive 
square 
root 
of 
negative 
two). 
Another 
such 
class 
concerns 
identity-statements 
(e.g. 
2 
is 
the 
predecessor 
of 
3). 
In 
this 
work, 
it 
is 
said 
what 
such 
statements 
mean 
and 
why 
they 
mean 
it. 


Our 
analyses 
of 
these 
statement-classes 
are 
compatible 
with 
Kripke’s 
cogent 
(1969) 
defense 
of 
Direct 
Reference 
Theory 
(names 
pick 
out 
their 
referents 
by 
labelling 
them, 
not 
by 
describing 
them), 
and 
they 
show 
that 
theory 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
classical 
logic. 


Many 
semanticists 
deny 
this 
last 
assertion 
and 
on 
that 
basis 
advocate 
far-reaching 
revisions 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
logic 
and 
commonsense. 
For 
example, 
according 
to 
Nathan 
Salmon 
and 
Scott 
Soames, 
Direct 
Reference 
Theory 
that: 


(i) 
Socrates 
simultaneously 
exists 
and 
fail 
to 
exist, 
and 
also 
more 
generally 
that: 


(ii) 
A 
given 
state 
of 
affairs 
can 
simultaneously 
obtain 
and 
fail 
to 
obtain. 
Being 
direct 
reference 
theorists 
themselves, 
Salmon 
and 
Soames 
accept 
(i) 
and 
(ii), 
and 
they 
also 
hold 
that: 


(iii) 
The 
laws 
of 
logic 
must 
be 
revised, 
so 
as 
to 
accommodate 
the 
putative 
truth 
of 
(i) 
and 
(ii). 
Salmon 
also 
believes, 
since 
he 
believes 
it 
to 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
Direct 
Reference 
Theory, 
that: 



(iv) 
To 
be 
is 
to 
conceived 
(e.g. 
given 
that 
one 
can 
have 
thoughts 
about 
perpetual 
motion 
machines, 
such 
machines 
exist). 
and 
also 
that: 


(v) 
One 
can 
rationally 
accept 
statements 
of 
the 
form 
P 
and 
not-P 
(e.g. 
Jim 
has 
a 
car 
and 
Jim 
does 
not 
have 
a 
car) 
Salmon 
duly 
holds 
that: 
(vi) 
The 
laws 
of 
classical 
logic 
must 
be 
revised, 
so 
as 
to 
accommodate 
the 
putative 
truth 
of 
(iv) 
and 
(v). 
In 
the 
present 
work 
it 
is 
shown 
that 
Direct 
Reference 
Theory 
has 
none 
of 
these 
consequences, 
any 
appearance 
to 
the 
contrary 
being 
rooted 
in 
a 
failure 
to 
understand 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
literal 
meanings 
of 
our 
words 
and 
contents 
of 
the 
thoughts 
embodied 
therein. 


This 
same 
failure, 
it 
is 
shown, 
is 
the 
very 
essence 
of 
Burge’s 
contention 
that: 


(vii) 
Should 
it 
turn 
out 
that 
Moses 
never 
existed, 
your 
Moses-
thoughts 
would 
turn 
out 
to 
be 
non-thoughts, 
and 
more 
generally 
that: 


(viii) 
The 
content 
of 
a 
given 
thought 
is 
irrelevant 
to 
its 
causal 
properties. 
A 
corollary 
of 
(viii) 
is 
that: 


(ix) 
A 
given 
thought’s 
psychological 
properties 
are 
unrelated 
to 
its 
content. 
A 
corollary 
of 
(ix) 
is 
that 


(x) 
Thoughts 
do 
nothing. 

Given 
that 
no 
occupant 
of 
space-time 
is 
without 
causal 
properties, 
a 
consequence 
of 
(x) 
is 
that: 


(xi) 
Thoughts 
do 
not 
exist. 
Thus, 
(viii) 
entails 
(xi). 
Since 
(xi) 
is 
false, 
so 
is 
(viii). 


Burge 
denies 
that 
(viii) 
entails 
(xi). 
He 
defends 
this 
position 
by 
taking 
the 
position 
that: 


(xii) 
An 
object’s 
causal 
properties 
cannot 
be 
understood 
in 
terms 
of 
events 
in 
its 
immediate 
neighborhood. 
This 
move 
on 
Burge’s 
part 
is 
contraindicated 
in 
many 
ways. 


First 
of 
all, 
(xii) 
is 
ad 
hoc. 


Further, 
(xii) 
is 
incompatible 
with 
basic 
precept 
of 
modern 
mechanics: 
No 
action 
at 
a 
distance, 
which, 
even 
if 
not 
strictly 
true, 
is 
accurate 
to 
a 
higher 
degree 
of 
approximation 
than 
is 
consistent 
with 
Burge’s 
theory. 


Moreover, 
considerations 
of 
a 
purely 
philosophical 
kind 
cannot 
possibly 
warrant 
rejection 
of 
that 
precept. 
Nor 
a 
fortiori 
can 
such 
considerations 
warrant 
rejection 
of 
the 
corresponding 
generalization: 
Nothing 
happens 
if 
could 
just 
as 
well 
not 
happen, 
known 
as 
the 
Principle 
of 
Sufficient 
Reason. 


Finally, 
given 
that 
philosophical 
thought 
is 
only 
as 
cogent 
as 
the 
Principle 
of 
Sufficient 
Reason 
is 
true, 
Burge’s 
theory 
is 
not 
only 
false 
but 
self-undermining. 


Being 
a 
textbook 
case 
of 
a 
degenerating 
research 
program, 
Burge’s 
theory 
and 
its 
derivatives, 
which 
include 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
theories 
of 
Nathan 
Salmon’s, 
have 
duly 
given 
way 
to 
an 
epicycle-free 
analysis, 
which 
it 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
volume 
to 
state 
and 
defend. 


The 
semantic 
doctrines 
defended 
by 
the 
present 
work 


Let 
us 
now 
state 
some 
of 
the 
semantic 
(meaning-related) 
doctrines 
that 
it 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
work 
to 
refute: 



(i) 
Some 
expressions 
have 
both 
meaning 
and 
reference. 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
has 
the 
same 
reference 
as 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general". 
But 
those 
expressions 
differ 
in 
meaning 
(or 
"sense"). 


(ii) 
An 
expression 
can 
be 
meaningful 
without 
referring 
to 
anything. 
Words 
like 
"or", 
"not", 
and 
"and" 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
anything. 
But 
they 
are 
obviously 
significant. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
morphemes 
like 
"-s" 
and 
"-ed". 
(iii) 
The 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
a 
proposition. 
Consider 
the 
sentence 
"snow 
is 
white". 
The 
meaning 
of 
this 
sentence 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
referent 
of 
the 
expression 
"the 
proposition 
that 
snow 
is 
white". 
Here 
is 
part 
of 
what 
I 
will 
try 
to 
establish 
in 
this 
work: 


(i*) 
No 
entity 
has 
both 
meaning 
and 
reference. 
Reference 
is 
a 
property 
of 
spatio-temporal 
entities 
(expression 
tokens). 
Sense 
is 
a 
property 
of 
platonic 
entities 
(expression 
types). 


(ii*) 
Tokens 
of 
"or", 
"if", 
and 
the 
like 
do 
refer, 
no 
less 
than 
tokens 
of 
"Plato" 
and 
"Socrates". 
Given 
a 
correct 
conception 
of 
reference, 
the 
difference 
between 
"categorematic" 
and 
"syncategorematic" 
entities 
collapses. 
Expressions 
that 
seem 
not 
to 
refer 
to 
anything 
– 
e.g. 
case-markers, 
sentence-connectives 
– 
refer 
to 
higher-order 
functions. 
The 
meaning 
of 
an 
expression-token 
always 
coincides 
with 
its 
referent. 
No 
meaningful 
expression-token 
does 
not 
refer. 


(iii*) 
Sentence-types 
do 
not 
have 
propositions 
for 
the 
meanings, 
and 
neither 
do 
sentence-tokens. 
The 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
function 
involving, 
but 
not 
identical 
with, 
a 
proposition. 
The 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence-type 
is 
a 
function 
involving, 
but 
not 
identical 
with, 
the 
kind 
of 
function 
just 
mentioned. 



There 
are 
two 
other 
views 
that 
I 
wish 
to 
combat. 
These 
two 
conflict 
with 
each 
other, 
but 
each 
has 
its 
proponents: 


(iv) 
Sentences 
refer 
to 
truth-values. 
(v) 
Sentences 
don’t 
refer 
to 
anything. 
First 
of 
all, 
there 
are 
sentence-types 
and 
sentence-tokens. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
a 
sentence 
simpliciter. 
So 
(v) 
and 
(vi) 
are 
ambiguous. 
(v) 
is 
false 
on 
both 
disambiguations. 
(vi) 
is 
false 
on 
one, 
true 
on 
another. 
What 
I 
believe 
is: 


(iv*) 
Sentence-types 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
anything: 
indeed, 
no 
expression-type 
refers. 
Reference 
is 
a 
property 
of 
expression-
tokens. 
Sentence-tokens 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
truth-values. 


(v*) 
Sentence-tokens 
do 
refer. 
They 
refer 
to 
their 
meanings. 
(Very 
roughly, 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
a 
proposition; 
less 
roughly, 
it 
is 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
function 
involving 
a 
proposition.) 


The 
misunderstandings 
that 
dominate 
contemporary 
philosophy 
of 
language 
have 
crystallized 
in 
an 
argument 
known 
as 
the 
"Slingshot". 
The 
Slingshot 
"proves" 
things 
that 
are 
obviously 
not 
true 
(e.g. 
that 
your 
car 
is 
identical 
with 
my 
computer). 
So 
we 
must 
look 
for 
errors 
in 
it. 
These 
are 
not 
hard 
to 
find. 
Once 
these 
errors 
are 
exposed, 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
to 
rethink 
and 
reconstruct 
many 
semantic 
orthodoxies. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
work 
is 
to 
effect 
that 
reconstruction. 


If 
cogent, 
the 
narrowly 
semantic 
arguments 
given 
in 
this 
work 
have 
far-reaching 
implications. 
They 
give 
us 
leverage 
on 
some 
perennial 
issues 
concerning 
knowledge 
and 
psychological 
explanation. 



The 
structure 
of 
the 
present 
work 


The 
present 
work 
is 
divided 
into 
two 
major 
sections 
or 
"volumes", 
as 
I 
will 
call 
them. 
In 
the 
first 
volume 
(Chapters 
2 
through 
16), 
I 
defend 
various 
semantic 
claims, 
the 
main 
ones 
being 
(i*)-(iv*). 
That 
volume 
will 
be 
concerned 
almost 
exclusively 
with 
semantics. 
Virtually 
nothing 
will 
be 
said 
about 
epistemology, 
modality, 
or 
psychological 
explanation. 


In 
the 
second 
volume 
(Chapters 
17 
through 
28), 
I 
draw 
what 
I 
believe 
to 
be 
the 
non-semantic 
consequences 
of 
the 
narrowly 
semantic 
points 
made 
in 
the 
first 
part. 
I 
discuss 
how, 
in 
light 
of 
those 
narrowly 
semantic 
points, 
we 
can 
obtain 
some 
insight 
into 
various 
problems 
relating 
to 
a 
doctrine 
(or, 
better, 
a 
family 
of 
interconnected 
doctrines) 
called 
"externalism". 
In 
connection 
with 
this, 
we 
will 
obtain 
insight 
into 
problems 
relating 
to 
epistemology, 
modality, 
and 
psychological 
explanation. 


Up 
to 
a 
point, 
the 
first 
volume 
is 
an 
articulation 
and 
consolidation 
of 
existing 
views. 
It 
will 
inevitably 
arouse 
disagreement. 
But 
because 
of 
its 
conservative 
nature, 
I 
don’t 
think 
that 
volume 
will 
be 
particularly 
controversial. 


The 
second 
volume 
is 
a 
different 
matter. 
There 
I 
will 
try 
to 
overthrow 
many 
orthodoxies 
of 
the 
present 
day. 
So 
the 
second 
volume, 
unlike 
the 
first, 
will 
arouse 
fierce 
and 
widespread 
resistance, 
though 
I 
will 
do 
my 
best 
to 
mitigate 
that 
through 
argumentation. 


The 
second 
volume 
will 
not 
be 
sheer 
iconoclasticism. 
I 
will 
indeed 
try 
to 
overthrow 
some 
contemporary 
orthodoxies. 
But 
I 
will 
do 
so 
by 
appealing 
to 
older 
and 
more 
deeply 
entrenched 
ones. 
So, 
from 
some 
viewpoint, 
what 
I 
say 
is 
actually 
quite 
conservative. 


I 
should 
point 
out 
that, 
in 
Volume 
II, 
I 
revisit 
certain 
narrowly 
semantic 
issues 
(e.g. 
whether 
anaphoric 
pronouns 
are 
bound 
variables) 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-semantic 
points 
for 
which 
I 
am 
there 
arguing. 
So 
the 
two 
volumes 
are 
intertwined 
in 
subject-matter. 


In 
what 
remains 
of 
this 
chapter, 
I 
will 
give 
a 
more 
precise 
statement 
of 
the 
views 
that 
will 
be 
defended 
in 
this 
work; 
and 
I 
will 
also 
give 
a 
brief 
outline 
my 
arguments 
for 
those 
views. 
But 
the 
arguments 
proper 
will 
be 
left 
to 
subsequent 
chapters. 


Chapter 
2 
Meaning 
versus 
Reference 



At 
some 
level, 
every 
version 
of 
the 
Slingshot 
assumes: 


(SS) 
Replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term 
can 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
meaning. 
Right 
now 
I 
want 
to 
give 
a 
couple 
of 
illustrations 
of 
how 
the 
Slingshot 
depends 
on 
that 
principle. 
And 
then 
I 
want 
to 
show 
why, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
that 
principle 
is 
false. 


Church 
1956 


Let 
us 
assume: 


(CR) 
Replacing 
expressions 
with 
co-referring 
expressions 
cannot 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
reference. 


(SR) 
Expressions 
that 
are 
synonymous 
(or 
"very 
nearly 
so") 
co-refer. 


According 
to 
Church 
(1956), 
if 
we 
grant 
these 
principles, 
then 
we 
can 
prove 
that 
sentences 
refer 
to 
truth-values: 


(i) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott. 
(ii) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
the 
author 
of 
Waverly. 
(iii) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
the 
man 
who 
wrote 
twenty-nine 
Waverly 
novels 
altogether. 
(iv) 
The 
number 
n, 
such 
that 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
wrote 
n 
Waverly 
novels, 
is 
twenty-nine. 
(v) 
The 
number 
of 
counties 
in 
Utah 
is 
twenty-nine. 
By 
CR, 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
and 
(iii) 
must 
all 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 


(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
are, 
in 
Church’s 
view, 
synonymous 
(or 
"very 
nearly 
so"). 
Nearly 
synonymous 
expressions 
must 
co-refer. 
So 
(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
co-
refer. 


By 
CR, 
(v) 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
(iv). 


It 
follows 
that 
(i) 
and 
(v) 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 
They 
also 
have 
the 


same 
truth-value. 
Indeed, 
the 
one 
significant 
thing 
that 
(i) 
and 
(v) 
have 
in 
common 
is 
that 
they 
are 
both 
true. 
CR 
preserves 
reference. 
The 
one 
significant 
property 
of 
sentences 



that 
CR 
preserves 
is 
truth-value. 
So 
sentence-reference 
is 
sentence 
truth-
value. 


What 
is 
true 
of 
(i) 
and 
(v) 
is 
true 
(mutatis 
mutandis) 
of 
any 
two 
true 
sentences. 
Let 
S 
and 
S* 
be 
any 
two 
true 
sentences 
you 
choose. 
Given 
CR, 
plus 
the 
innocuous 
principle 
that 
synonymous 
expressions 
co-refer, 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
syntax-chopping 
shows 
that 
S 
and 
S* 
have 
the 
same 
referent. 


Thus 
any 
two 
true 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing: 
the 
property 
of 
truth. 


An 
exactly 
similar 
argument 
shows 
that 
any 
two 
false 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing: 
the 
property 
of 
falsity. 


A 
problem 


There 
is 
a 
problem 
with 
Church’s 
argument. 
Church 
assumes 
that 
"Scott" 
and 
"the 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
both 
refer 
to 
Scott. 
Suppose 
he 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 


(i) 
Scott 
was 
wise 
and 


(ii) 
The 
author 
of 
Waverly 
was 
wise 
ought 
to 
mean 
the 
same 
thing. 
They 
both 
ought 
to 
mean: 


(iii) 
Scott 
was 
wise. 
What 
does 
it 
mean 
to 
say 
that 
"the 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
refers 
to 
Scott? 
Presumably, 
it 
means 
exactly 
this: 
sentences 
of 
the 
form 
"…the 
author 
of 
Waverly…" 
mean:…Scott… 


Therefore, 
replacing 
"the 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
ought 
not 
to 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
meaning. 


So 
lines 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
must 
both 
mean: 


(iR) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 



Church 
assumes 
that 
"twenty-nine" 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
"The 
number 
of 
counties 
in 
Utah" 
and 
also 
"the 
number 
n, 
such 
that 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
wrote 
n 
Waverly 
novels". 
He 
assumes 
they 
all 
refer 
to 
the 
number 
twenty-nine. 


Let 
us 
suppose 
he 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
by 
reasoning 
exactly 
similar 
to 
that 
just 
given, 
lines 
(iii)-(v) 
must 
all 
mean: 


(iiiR) 
The 
number 
twenty-nine 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
number 
twenty-
nine. 


Thus 
(i)-(v) 
are 
synonymous 
with: 


(iR) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 


(iiR) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 


(iiiR) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 


(ivR) 
The 
number 
twenty-nine 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
number 
twenty-
nine. 


(vR) 
The 
number 
twenty-nine 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
number 
twenty-
nine. 


(iiiR) 
and 
(ivR) 
are 
not 
synonymous. 
The 
argument 
fails. 


The 
response: 
SS 


There 
is 
an 
obvious 
response. 
Church 
can 
say: 


Two 
terms 
can 
co-refer 
and 
have 
different 
meanings. 
"Scott" 
and 
"the 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
both 
refer 
to 
Scott. 
But 


(i) 
"Scott 
was 
wise" 
and 
(ii) 
"The 
author 
of 
Waverly 
was 
wise" 

obviously 
have 
different 
meanings. 
We 
explain 
this 
by 
saying: 
referring 
terms 
have 
both 
sense 
and 
reference. 
What 
a 
referring 
term 
semantically 
contributes 
is 
not 
just 
its 
referent. 
And 
co-referring 
terms 
can 
have 
different 
senses. 


If 
this 
is 
right, 
then 
terms 
that 
co-refer 
can 
make 
different 
semantic 
contributions. 
This 
is 
equivalent 
to 
saying: 
in 
some 
cases, 
replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term 
can 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
"sense" 
or 
meaning. 
Let 
us 
refer 
to 
this 
principle 
as 
(SS). 


(SS) 
Replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term 
can 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
meaning. 


If 
(SS) 
is 
false, 
then 
Church’s 
argument 
is 
blocked. 
So 
Church’s 
argument 
does 
not 
assume 
only 
(LL) 
and 
(CR). 
It 
also 
assumes 
the 
correctness 
of 
a 
certain 
semantic 
theory: 
it 
assumes 
that, 
at 
least 
in 
some 
cases, 
co-referring 
terms 
can 
have 
different 
meanings 
and, 
consequently, 
that 
replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term 
can 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
meaning. 


Frege’s 
argument 


Frege’s 
original 
argument[1] 
assumes 
(CR). 
Consider 
the 
following 
two 
sentences: 


(a) 
"Socrates 
was 
wise". 
(b) 
"The 
unique 
x 
such 
that 
triangles 
have 
three 
sides 
and 
x 
drank 
hemlock 
and 
x=Socrates 
was 
wise". 
(b) 
is 
what 
results 
when 
a 
referring 
term 
in 
(a) 
is 
replaced 
with 
a 
co-
referring 
term. 


By 
(CR), 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
cannot 
differ 
in 
their 
referent. 


The 
fact 
that 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
have 
the 
same 
referent 
seems 
to 
show 
that 


the 
referent 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
not 
the 
proposition 
it 
encodes. 
For 
it 
seems 
quite 
plain 
that 
(a) 
encodes 
a 
different 
proposition 
from 
(b). 
(b) 
encodes 
a 



proposition 
about 
hemlock-drinking; 
(a) 
does 
not. 


So 
given 
that 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
must 
have 
the 
same 
referent, 
and 
given 
also 
that 
they 
encode 
different 
propositions, 
it 
does 
follow 
that 
what 
a 
sentence 
refers 
to 
is 
not 
the 
proposition 
it 
bears. 


Given 
only 
that 
sentences 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
propositions, 
it 
does 
not 
yet 
follow 
that 
sentences 
refer 
to 
truth-values. 
But, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
what 
has 
been 
said, 
Frege 
is 
able 
to 
show 
just 
this. 


Let 
S 
be 
any 
true 
sentence, 
and 
let 
P 
be 
any 
true 
proposition. 
Merely 
by 
replacing 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms, 
we 
can 
produce 
a 
sentence 
S* 
that 
has 
P 
for 
at 
least 
part 
of 
its 
meaning. 


Pick 
any 
true 
proposition 
you 
wish 
– 
say, 
arithmetic 
is 
incomplete. 
Pick 
any 
sentence 
you 
wish 
– 
say 
(a). 
Merely 
by 
replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
in 


(a) 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term, 
we 
can 
produce 
a 
sentence 
that 
has 
the 
proposition 
arithmetic 
is 
incomplete 
for 
at 
least 
part 
of 
its 
meaning: 
(c) 
"the 
unique 
x 
such 
that 
arithmetic 
is 
incomplete 
and 
x=Socrates 
was 
wise." 
This 
point 
generalizes 
without 
limit. 
Take 
any 
true 
sentence 
you 
wish. 
Call 
it 
S. 
Take 
any 
true 
proposition 
you 
wish. 
Call 
it 
P. 
If 
we 
allow 
ourselves 
only 
to 
replace 
the 
referring 
terms 
in 
S 
with 
co-referring 
terms, 
we 
can 
produce 
a 
true 
sentence 
S* 
at 
least 
part 
of 
whose 
meaning 
is 
P. 


By 
CR, 
S 
and 
S* 
must 
have 
the 
same 
referent. 


S 
and 
S* 
needn’t 
mean 
the 
same 
thing. 
In 
fact, 
there 
is 
no 
limit 
to 
how 
much 
they 
may 
differ 
in 
respect 
of 
what 
their 
meanings 
are. 


Indeed, 
if 
we 
allow 
ourselves 
only 
to 
replace 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms, 
we 
can 
destroy 
almost 
everything 
that 
is 
semantically 
significant 
about 
a 
sentence. 


But 
the 
truth-value 
will 
never 
be 
changed. 


CR 
does 
not 
preserve 
sense. 


CR 
does 
preserve 
reference. 


CR 
preserves 
truth-value. 


Reference 
is 
the 
only 
thing 
CR 
preserves. 


Therefore, 
sentence-reference 
must 
be 
sentence 
truth-value. 
If 
sentences 
refer 
to 
anything, 
then 
all 
true 
sentences 
must 
refer 
to 
the 
truth-
value 
true. 


An 
exactly 
analogous 
argument 
shows 
that 
all 
false 
sentences 
must 



refer 
to 
the 
truth-value 
false. 


Let 
us 
sum 
up. 
Given 
CR, 
it 
seems 
to 
follow 
that 
all 
true 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
– 
the 
truth-value 
true 
– 
and 
all 
true 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
– 
the 
truth-value 
false. 


Frege’s 
need 
for 
(SS) 


Frege’s 
argument, 
like 
Church’s, 
implicitly 
assumes 
(SS). 


If 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
mean 
the 
same 
thing, 
we 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
referent 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
anything 
other 
than 
the 
proposition 
it 
encodes. 


(b) 
is 
what 
results 
when 
a 
referring 
term 
in 
(a) 
is 
replaced 
with 
a 
co-
referring 
term. 
If 
that 
replacement 
does 
not 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
meaning, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
the 
referent 
of 
(a) 
or 
(b) 
is 
anything 
other 
than 
its 
meaning. 
In 
general, 
if 
replacements 
of 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms 
do 
not 
result 
in 
changes 
of 
meaning, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
co-referring 
sentences 
can 
differ 
in 
meaning. 
Replacing 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms 
surely 
preserves 
sentence-reference. 
But 
if 
it 
also 
preserves 
meaning, 
then 
sentence-meaning 
and 
sentence-reference 
never 
pull 
apart, 
and 
we 
have 
no 
reason 
for 
believing 
that 
sentences 
refer 
to 
anything 
other 
than 
their 
meanings. 


But 
if 
we 
accept 
Frege’s 
assumptions, 
then 
it 
seems 
that 
(a) 
and 
(b) 
must 
encode 
the 
same 
proposition. 
Frege 
assumes 
that 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
"the 
unique 
x 
such 
that 
x 
drank 
hemlock 
and 
x=Socrates". 
In 
that 
case, 
those 
expressions 
ought 
to 
contribute 
the 
exact 
same 
thing 
(Socrates). 
So 
(b) 
ought 
to 
be 
synonymous 
with: 


(bR) 
"Socrates 
was 
wise." 


By 
exactly 
similar 
reasoning, 
(c) 
ought 
to 
be 
synonymous 
with: 


(cR) 
"Socrates 
was 
wise." 


But 
(cR) 
and 
(bR) 
encode 
precisely 
the 
same 
proposition 
as 
(a). 
Contrary 
to 
what 
Frege 
says, 
it 
turns 
out 
not 
to 
be 
possible 
to 
change 
sentence-meaning 
by 
replacing 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms. 
This 



destroys 
his 
argument. 


Frege 
has 
a 
famous 
response. 
He 
says 
that 
referring 
terms 
have 
both 
"sense" 
and 
reference.[2] 
A 
referring 
term 
contributes 
not 
only 
its 
referent 
but 
its 
sense. 
Co-referring 
terms 
can 
have 
different 
senses. 
So 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
change 
sentence-meaning 
by 
replacing 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms. 


Let 
us 
sum 
up. 
If 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
change 
sentence-meaning 
by 
replacing 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms, 
then 
Frege’s 
argument 
is 
blocked: 
all 
of 
(a)-(c) 
encode 
the 
very 
same 
proposition. 
If 
it 
isn’t 
possible 
to 
change 
what 
a 
sentence 
means 
by 
replacing 
referring 
terms 
with 
co-referring 
terms, 
then 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
any 
reason 
to 
suppose 
that 
a 
sentence’s 
referent 
is 
different 
from 
its 
meaning. 
So 
Frege 
needs 
(SS) 
to 
be 
true. 


More 
on 
SS 


I 
will 
argue 
that 
SS 
is 
simply 
a 
confusion: 
actually 
a 
mass 
of 
confusions. 
It 
involves 
confusions 
of 
expression-types 
with 
expression-
tokens. 
It 
involves 
confusions 
of 
literal 
meaning 
and 
communicated 
meaning 


– 
more 
exactly 
of 
semantics 
with 
pre-semantics. 
But 
SS 
seems 
extremely 
plausible. 
In 
fact, 
its 
negation 
seems 
extremely 
implausible. 
Surely 
"Plato" 
and 
"the 
greatest 
teacher 
of 
Aristotle" 
co-refer. 
Yet 
surely 
they 
have 
different 
meanings. 
So 
surely 


"Plato 
was 
wise" 


doesn’t 
have 
quite 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 


"the 
greatest 
teacher 
of 
Aristotle 
was 
wise". 


No 
one 
can 
deny 
the 
force 
of 
this 
point. 


Some 
of 
the 
incoherencies 
in 
Frege’s 
view 


Let 
us 
begin 
by 
stating 
the 
more 
important 
components 
of 
Frege’s 
semantics. 


"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
singular 
term. 
But 
when 
that 
expression 
occurs 
in 
a 
sentence, 
the 
proposition 
thereby 
meant 
does 
not 
have 



Benjamin 
Franklin 
as 
a 
constituent. 
Rather, 
it 
has 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
expression 
"inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
as 
a 
constituent. 


Frege 
also 
holds 
that 
when 
an 
expression 
occurs 
in 
an 
"oblique" 
context, 
it 
undergoes 
a 
shift 
in 
reference. 
Right 
now, 
let 
us 
illustrate 
the 
concept 
of 
obliquity 
with 
some 
examples. 


(*) 
"John 
believes 
that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 


(*) 
comprises 
the 
sentence 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 
But 
the 
truth-value 
of 
the 
(*) 
is 
not 
a 
function 
of 
the 
truth-value 
the 
component 
sentence. 
If 
you 
replace 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
with 
another 
true 
sentences 
(e.g. 
"there 
are 
infinitely 
many 
primes") 
the 
resulting 
host 
sentence 
may 
be 
false. 


The 
occurrence 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
constitutes 
a 
piece 
of 
what 
Latinists 
refer 
to 
as 
"indirect 
discourse". 
It 
is 
not 
occurring 
assertively 
in 
that 
context. 
Contrast 
(*) 
with: 


(**) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored 
and 
snow 
is 
white". 


In 
(**), 
both 
component 
sentences 
do 
occur 
assertively. 


"Oblique 
context" 
is 
usually 
defined 
thus. 
Let 
s 
be 
a 
sentence 
that 
occurs 
as 
a 
part 
of 
some 
other 
sentence 
S. 
s 
occurs 
non-obliquely 
if 
it 
occurs 
truth-functionally, 
and 
it 
occurs 
obliquely 
if 
it 
occurs 
non-truth-functionally. 


But 
this 
definition 
isn’t 
accurate: 


(***) 
"It 
is 
true 
that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored." 


In 
(***), 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
occurs 
truth-functionally 
but 
obliquely. 
Why 
do 
I 
say 
this? 
In 
(***), 
"that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
is 
doing 
exactly 
the 
same 
thing 
that 
it 
is 
doing 
in 
(*). 
Therefore 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 
So 
an 
oblique 
occurrence 
may 
be 
truth-functional, 
contrary 
to 
what 
is 
usually 
maintained. 


Right 
now, 
we 
are 
going 
to 
set 
aside 
the 
question 
how 
exactly 
to 
define 
"oblique 
context." 
We 
will 
soon 
revisit 
it, 
to 
discover 
that 
on 
any 
legitimate 
definition 
of 
"oblique 
context", 
Frege’s 
system 
collapses. 
But 
right 
now 
we 
need 
only 
register 
one 
of 
Frege’s 
more 
startling 
positions. 
He 
holds 



that, 
when 
a 
referring 
term 
occurs 
in 
an 
oblique 
context, 
it 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
what 
it 
otherwise 
refers 
to: 
rather, 
it 
refers 
to 
its 
sense. 
So 
in 
both 
(*) 
and 
(***), 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
Franklin; 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 
And 
in 


(****) 
"It 
is 
true 
John 
believes 
that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored", 


it 
refers 
to 
a 
concept 
of 
that 
concept. 


Frege 
had 
a 
very 
good 
reason 
for 
holding 
this 
view. 
There 
is 
every 
reason 
to 
accept 
compositionality. 
There 
is 
also 
every 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 


(bfs) 
"That 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 


(pmgs) 
"That 
the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored". 


They 
seem 
to 
refer 
to 
different 
propositions. 


Finally, 
there 
is 
every 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
and 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
are 
co-referring 
terms. 


With 
one 
qualification, 
Frege 
held 
all 
these 
views. 


Frege 
also 
realized 
that 
they 
cannot 
all 
be 
consistently 
held. 
What 
(a) 
refers 
to 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
definite 
description 
occurring 
in 
it. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
(b). 
So 
compositionality 
requires 
Frege 
to 
hold 
that 
in 
those 
contexts, 
definite 
descriptions 
refer 
to 
their 
customary 
senses. 
For 
similar 
reasons, 
he 
holds 
that 
the 
same 
thing 
applies 
to 
proper 
names. 
So 
in 
oblique 
contexts 
referring 
terms 
refer 
to 
their 
senses, 
not 
their 
ordinary 
referents. 


§ 
Frege 
had 
another 
powerful 
reason 
for 
supposing 
that, 
in 
oblique 
contexts, 
referring 
terms 
refer 
to 
their 
ordinary 
sense. 
These 
reasons 
relate 
to 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
If 
A=B, 
then 
A 
has 
a 
property 
P 
iff 
B 
has 
that 
property. 


Throughout 
this 
work, 
when 
I 
talk 
about 
Leibniz’s 
law, 
I 
am 
not 
talking 
about 
a 
principle 
governing 
the 
intersubstitutibility 
of 
expressions. 
I 
am 
talking 
about 
a 
rule 
concerning 
objects. 
If 
the 
object 
A 
really 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
object 
B, 
then 
surely 
A 
cannot 
have 
any 
property 
not 
had 
by 
B. 
If 
A 
really 
is 
such 
that 
John 
believes 
it 
to 
be 
equal 
to 
two, 
then 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
B. 



Frege 
believed 
that, 
in 
some 
contexts, 
replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term 
changes 
truth-value: 


(A) 
"John 
believes 
that 
two 
is 
greater 
than 
one." 
(True) 
(B) 
"John 
believes 
that 
the 
unique 
number 
n 
such 
that 
n=2 
if 
there 
are 
continuous 
functions 
that 
cannot 
be 
differentiated 
at 
any 
point 
and 
such 
that 
n=1 
otherwise 
is 
greater 
than 
one." 
(False.) 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
that 
the 
number 
two 
should 
both 
have 
and 
lack 
a 
given 
property. 
Either 
it 
has 
it 
or 
it 
doesn’t. 
If 
the 
number 
one 
has 
the 
property 
of 
being 
such 
that 
John 
believes 
it 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
one, 
then 
it 
has 
that 
property. 
Period. 
If 
the 
number 
one 
has 
that 
property, 
then 
anything 
identical 
with 
it 
has 
that 
property. 
So 
that 
property 
is 
also 
had 
by 
the 
unique 
number 
n 
such 
that 
n=2 
if 
there 
are 
continuous 
functions 
that 
cannot 
be 
differentiated 
at 
any 
point 
and 
such 
that 
n=1 
otherwise 
is 
greater 
than 
one. 


But 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
proposition 
communicated 
by 
(A) 
has 
a 
different 
truth-value 
from 
that 
communicated 
by 
(B). 
(And 
it 
seems 
highly 
reasonable 
– 
almost 
undeniable 
--to 
suppose 
that 
this 
difference 
has 
a 
basis 
in 
what 
is 
literally 
meant 
by 
those 
sentences.) 


Suppose 
that, 
in 
(A) 
and 
(B), 
"two" 
and 
"the 
unique 
number 
n 
such 
that 
n=2 
if 
there 
are 
continuous 
functions 
that 
cannot 
be 
differentiated 
at 
any 
point 
and 
such 
that 
n=1 
otherwise" 
refer 
to 
the 
number 
two. 
In 
that 
case, 
it 
seems 
as 
though 
both 
(A) 
and 
(B) 
are 
doing 
the 
same 
thing. 
They 
are 
attributing 
a 
certain 
property 
to 
that 
number: 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
John 
believes 
x 
to 
be 
greater 
than 
one. 
But 
if 
each 
of 
(A) 
and 
(B) 
attributes 
that 
property 
to 
that 
object, 
then 
they 
cannot 
differ 
in 
truth-value. 
So 
since 
they 
do 
differ 
in 
truth-value, 
we 
must 
suppose 
that 
they 
don’t 
have 
ordinary 
referents. 
To 
sum 
up, 
consideration 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
behavior 
of 
expressions 
in 
indirect 
contexts, 
requires 
us 
to 
suppose 
that 
in 
such 
contexts 
expressions 
refer 
to 
their 
senses, 
not 
their 
ordinary 
referents. 


So 
Frege 
holds 
the 
views 
previously 
stated 
with 
the 
qualification 
that, 
when 
an 
expression 
occurs 
in 
an 
oblique 
context, 
it 
undergoes 
a 
shift 
in 
reference: 
it 
refers 
to 
its 
sense. 


Here 
is 
what 
I 
would 
like 
to 
argue. 
First, 
(SS) 
is 
wrong; 
and 
it 
is 
not 
needed 
to 
account 
for 
facts 
about 
cognitive 
significance. 
Second, 
Frege’s 
views 
on 
indirect 
reference 
are 
wrong. 
Finally, 
those 
two 
views, 
in 
addition 



to 
being 
wrong 
and 
unnecessary, 
are 
inconsistent 
with 
each 
other. 


The 
Demolition 
of 
SS 


Let 
us 
begin 
with 
a 
preliminary 
argument 
against 
(SS). 
Consider 
the 
sentence: 


(*) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 


Frege 
says 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
an 
expression 
that 
refers 
to 
Franklin. 
But 
Frege 
also 
says 
that 
Franklin 
himself 
is 
not 
a 
constituent 
of 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(*). 
What 
is 
such 
a 
constituent 
is 
not 
Franklin, 
but 
is 
rather 
a 
"sense". 
A 
sense 
is 
a 
concept 
(in 
the 
non-psychological, 
platonic 
sense) 
– 
in 
this 
case, 
it 
would 
be 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
(or 
perhaps 
unique 
inventor 
of 
bifocals). 
So 
on 
Frege’s 
view, 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(*) 
has 
that 
concept 
or 
sense 
as 
a 
constituent. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
let 
us 
suppose, 
with 
Frege, 
that 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
a 
constituent 
of 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 
In 
that 
case, 
that 
proposition 
has 
the 
form:… 
inventor 
of 
bifocals…So, 
presumably, 
that 
proposition 
says 
something 
about 
that 
concept. 
Supposing 
this 
is 
the 
case, 
what 
would 
that 
proposition 
say? 
We 
know 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
is 
not 
going 
to 
be 
true 
if 
there 
is 
no 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 
And 
we 
know 
that 
it 
won’t 
be 
true 
of 
there 
are 
multiple 
inventors 
of 
bifocals. 
(In 
this 
context, 
let 
us 
leave 
aside 
issues 
relating 
to 
contextual 
salience.) 
So 
if 
that 
sentence 
is 
to 
be 
true 
there 
must 
be 
some 
x 
such 
that 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals. 
Of 
course, 
if 
x 
doesn’t 
snore, 
then 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
will 
be 
false. 
So, 
in 
Russell’s 
view, 
if 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored", 
then 
that 
sentence 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
logically 
equivalent 
with: 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals; 
moreover, 
x 
snored. 
And 
if 
that 
proposition, 
or 
one 
logically 
equivalent 
thereto, 
is 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
the 
sentence 
in 
question, 
then 
it 
really 
does 
seem 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
quantifier 
(a 
kind 
of 
existential 
quantifier). 
To 
sum 
up: 
if 
the 
concept 
inventor 
if 
bifocals 
is 
a 
constituent 
of 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
sentences 
of 
the 
form 
"…the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals…", 
then 
it 
seems 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
quantifier, 
and 
not 
a 
singular 
term. 


The 
other 
side 
of 
the 
story 
is 
that 
if 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 



singular 
term 
that 
refers 
to 
Franklin, 
then 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
does 
not 
make 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 
What 
would 
make 
it 
in 
would 
be 
Franklin 
himself: 
the 
sentence 
would 
encode 
the 
proposition 
Franklin 
snored. 
It 
would 
not, 
in 
that 
case, 
encode 
anything 
about 
bifocal-inventing. 


Here 
is 
the 
long 
and 
short 
of 
it. 
Suppose 
that 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(*) 
has 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
as 
a 
constituent. 
In 
that 
case, 
the 
proposition 
meant 
is 
identical 
with, 
or 
logically 
equivalent 
to: 


(**) 
For 
some 
x, 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals; 
moreover, 
x 
snored. 


But 
if 
(**) 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
(*), 
then 
Russell’s 
theory 
of 
descriptions 
is 
right: 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
quantifiers, 
not 
singular 
terms. 


§ 
Admittedly, 
the 
argument 
just 
given 
is 
far 
from 
conclusive. 
There 
is 
a 
position 
we 
haven’t 
yet 
explored. 
One 
could 
say 
that 
(*) 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
(**), 
but 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
still 
a 
singular 
term. 


More 
generally, 
*The 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
*exactly 
one 
thing 
x 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
also 
has 
psi*. 
But 
*the 
phi* 
is 
still 
a 
singular 
term. 
This 
is 
the 
position 
held 
by 
Anderson 
(1975). 
It 
is, 
I 
believe, 
the 
view 
that 
any 
Fregean 
must 
hold; 
and 
it 
is 
a 
wonder 
that 
it 
is 
not 
more 
widely 
advocated. 
For 
reasons 
we’ve 
seen, 
it 
is 
pretty 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
(as 
opposed 
to 
Franklin) 
is 
a 
constituent 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
(*), 
then 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(*) 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
(**). 
Suppose 
that 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
if 
the 
definite 
description 
is 
a 
singular 
term, 
it 
immediately 
follows 
that 
(*) 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
(**), 
but 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
singular 
term. 


How 
would 
such 
a 
view 
be 
defended? 
The 
general 
conceit 
would 
be 
this. 
Semantics 
cannot 
be 
read 
off 
of 
logical 
equivalences. 
"1+1=2" 
and 
"triangles 
have 
three 
sides" 
are 
logically 
equivalent. 
But 
semantically 
they 
are 
as 
different 
as 
can 
be. 


This 
position 
can 
be 
applied 
in 
a 
way 
that 
is 
more 
specific 
to 
the 
issues 
at 
hand. 
Given 
only 
that: 


(A) 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 



(B) 
*something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
also 
has 
psi*, 
it 
by 
no 
means 
follows 
that 
*the 
phi* 
is 
a 
quantifier. 
After 
all, 


(C) 
"Socrates 
is 
bald" 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 


(D) 
"Something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
is 
bald." 
But 
"Socrates" 
is 
not 
a 
quantifier. 
In 
fact, 
any 
true 
sentence 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
some 
sentence 
of 
the 
form 
"something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi 
and 
x 
has 
psi". 
For 
example, 
"turtles 
play 
golf" 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
"there 
is 
some 
number 
n 
such 
that 
(n+1=2 
and 
turtles 
play 
golf), 
and 
turtles 
are 
either 
square 
or 
not 
square". 
So 
semantics 
cannot 
always 
be 
read 
off 
of 
logical 
equivalences. 


Nonetheless, 
I 
think 
if 
*the 
phi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
its 
Russellian 
counter-part, 
then 
it 
really 
is 
just 
a 
quantifier. 
If 
(*) 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
(**), 
then 
Russell’s 
theory 
is 
right, 
and 
Frege’s 
theory 
is 
wrong. 


Consider 
(C). 
The 
lack 
of 
quantificational 
structure 
in 
(C) 
shows 
up 
when 
you 
negate 
it 
or 
otherwise 
embed 
it 
in 
a 
larger 
sentential 
context. 


(CN1) 
"Socrates 
is 
not 
bald" 


is 
in 
no 
way 
ambiguous. 
But 
if 
(C) 
had 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 
(D), 
then 
(C1) 
would 
be 
ambiguous 
between: 


(CN2) 
"Something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
is 
not 
bald" 


and 



(CN3) 
"it 
is 
not 
the 
case 
that 
something 
is 
uniquely 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
is 
bald". 


Similarly, 


(CM1) 
"Socrates 
is 
necessarily 
bald" 


is 
not 
ambiguous. 
But 
if 
(C) 
had 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 
(D), 
then 
(CM1) 
would 
be 
ambiguous 
between 


(CM2) 
"Something 
x 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
necessarily: 
x 
is 
bald" 


and 


(CM3) 
"Necessarily: 
something 
x 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
x 
is 
bald" 


(*)"Necessarily: 
Socrates 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates" 


is 
unambiguously 
true. 
But 
if 
"Socrates" 
were 
a 
quantifier 
of 
the 
kind 
in 
question, 
then 
(*) 
would 
be 
ambiguous 
between 
a 
true 
statement 
and 
a 
false 
one: 


(**) 
Necessarily: 
something 
x 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates.

Something

is 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
necessarily: 
x 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates. 


(**) 
is 
false; 
(***) 
is 
true. 


So 
the 
fact 
that 
"Socrates" 
is 
not 
a 
quantifier 
is 
revealed 
by 
the 
ambiguity 
of 
sentences 
like 
(*) 
and 
(CM1), 
and 
the 
like. 


Given 
this, 
suppose 
that 



(#) 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 


is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 


(##) 
*something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
has 
psi*. 


In 
that 
case, 


(#N) 
*necessarily: 
the 
phi 
has 
psi*. 


would 
be 
ambiguous, 
as 
the 
necessity 
operator 
could 
be 
given 
different 
degrees 
of 
scope. 
For 
example, 


(#N1) 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
necessarily 
identical 
with 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 


becomes 
ambiguous 
between 


(#N2) 
"necessarily: 
something 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
something 
y 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x=y" 


and 


(#N3) 
"something 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
something 
y 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
necessarily: 
x=y". 


(#N2) 
is 
false; 
(#N3) 
is 
true. 


So 
the 
very 
things 
which 
show 
that 
"Socrates" 
is 
not 
a 
quantifier 
seem 
to 
show 
that 
*the 
phi*, 
as 
Anderson 
analyses 
it, 
is 
a 
quantifier. 
Where 
"Socrates 
is 
bald" 
can 
only 
be 
negated 
one 
way, 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
can 
be 
negated 
in 
two 
ways. 
Where 
"necessarily 
Socrates 
is 
Socrates" 
is 
unambiguously 
true, 
*necessarily 
the 
phi 
is 
the 
phi* 
is 
only 
ambiguously 
true. 
And 
so 
on. 
So 
the 
very 
considerations 
that 
make 
"Socrates" 
not 
be 
a 
quantifier 
aren’t 
there 
to 
make 
*the 
phi* 
(as 
Anderson 
analyses 
it) 
not 
be 
a 
quantifier. 



There 
is 
a 
similar 
line 
of 
thought 
to 
consider. 
Suppose 
that 
"Sukrat" 
is 
a 
proper 
name 
that 
is 
co-referential 
with 
"Socrates" 
(which, 
let 
us 
assume, 
is 
also 
a 
proper 
name): 


($) 
"Socrates 
is 
bald. 
Socrates= 
Sukrat. 
Therefore 
Sukrat 
is 
bald." 


($) 
is 
a 
genuine 
application 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
suppose 
that 
Russell 
(not 
Anderson) 
is 
right 
about 
definite 
descriptions. 
In 
that 
case: 


($$) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
bald. 
The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals=the 
first 
post-master 
general. 
Therefore 
the 
first 
post-master 
general 
is 
bald." 


($$) 
is 
certainly 
a 
valid 
argument. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
a 
straightforward 
application 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
As 
Neale 
(1990) 
points 
out, 
it 
is 
not 
an 
immediate 
application 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law, 
but 
rather 
a 
theorem 
(of 
the 
system 
of 
the 
PM) 
that: 


($$$) 
The 
phi 
has 
psi. 
The 
phi=the 
chi. 
Therefore 
the 
chi 
has 
psi. 


Of 
course, 
the 
system 
of 
the 
PM 
is 
a 
purely 
extensional 
one: 
it 
contains 
no 
troublesome 
– 
e.g. 
epistemic, 
modal 
--operators. 
If 
it 
weren’t, 
then 
($$$) 
would 
simply 
be 
invalid. 


In 
any 
case, 
($$$) 
is 
surely 
not 
identical 
with 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 


It 
certainly 
seems 
that 
if 


(#) 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 


is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 


(##) 
*something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
has 
psi*, 


then 


($$) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
bald; 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals=the 
first 
post-master 
general; 
therefore 
the 
first 
post-master 
general 
is 
bald" 



is 
not 
a 
straightforward 
application 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
The 
logic 
behind 
($$) 
is 
more 
complicated 
than 
that 
behind 
($), 
even 
though 
both 
are 
valid. 
And 
I 
don’t 
see 
that 
the 
proof-theoretic 
differences 
between 
($) 
and 
($$) 
vanish 
if 
it 
is 
maintained 
that 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
singular 
terms 
(that 
are 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
Russellian 
quantifiers) 
– 
the 
proof 
of 
($$) 
will 
still 
be 
different 
from 
that 
of 
($). 
So 
if 
*the 
phi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
its 
Russellian 
counter-part, 
the 
logic 
governing 
sentences 
containing 
it 
will 
be 
very 
close 
to, 
if 
not 
identical 
with, 
the 
logic 
governing 
Russellian 
quantifiers, 
and 
very 
different 
from 
the 
logic 
governing 
things 
that 
we 
know 
to 
be 
singular 
terms 
(e.g. 
"Socrates"). 
So 
it 
becomes 
unclear 
what 
it 
could 
y 
mean 
to 
say 
that 
*the 
phi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
a 
Russellian 
quantifier 
but 
is 
still 
a 
singular 
term. 


Leibniz’s 
Law 
and 
the 
logic 
of 
identity 
statements 


As 
we’ve 
noted, 
there 
are 
no 
actual 
exceptions 
to 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
So 
no 
legitimate 
semantic 
system 
can 
allow 
there 
to 
be 
actual 
violations 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
Frege 
noted 
that 
there 
are 
apparent 
violations 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law 
(in 
modal, 
epistemic, 
etc. 
contexts). 
Partly 
for 
this 
reason, 
he 
said 
that, 
in 
such 
contexts, 
referring 
terms 
don’t 
have 
their 
ordinary 
referents: 
this 
semantic 
shift 
prevents 
the 
occurrence 
of 
any 
actual 
violations 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 


According 
to 
Neale 
(1990), 
if 
Russell 
is 
right, 
then 


($$) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
bald. 
The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals=the 
first 
post-master 
general. 
Therefore 
the 
first 
post-master 
general 
is 
bald" 


is 
not 
an 
instance 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law 
at 
all. 
By 
the 
same 
token, 


($$SB) 
"Smith 
believes 
that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
bald. 
The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals=the 
first 
post-master 
general. 
Therefore 
Smith 
believes 
that 
the 
first 
post-master 
general 
is 
bald" 


is 
not 
a 
violation 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
If 
Anderson 
is 
right 
about 
definite 
descriptions, 
then 
(as 
we’ve 



discussed) 
it 
seems 
that 
($$) 
is 
not 
an 
instance 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law 
(though 
the 
proof 
of 
it 
involves 
that 
law). 
So 
by 
the 
same 
token, 
if 
Anderson’s 
semantics 
is 
right, 
($$SB) 
is 
not 
a 
violation 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
So, 
on 
Anderson’s 
semantics, 
a 
need 
to 
safeguard 
Leibniz’s 
Law 
does 
not 
require 
us 
to 
suppose 
that 
epistemic 
(and 
modal…) 
contexts 
induce 
semantic 
shifts. 
After 
all, 
on 
Anderson’s 
semantics, 
as 
on 
Russell’s, 
($$) 
is 
no 
more 
an 
instance 
of 
Leibniz’s 
Law 
than 
($$SB) 
is 
a 
violation 
of 
it. 


Let 
us 
close 
this 
particular 
argument. 
Consider: 


(i) 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi.* 
Suppose 
that 
O 
is 
the 
unique 
phi. 
If 
Frege 
is 
right, 
then 
the 
concept 
phi, 
and 
not 
O, 
is 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(i). 
But 
if 
that 
is 
the 
case, 
then 
(i) 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with: 


(ii) 
*something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
also 
has 
psi*. 
It 
would 
also 
follow 
that: 


(iii) 
*John 
believes 
that 
the 
phi 
has 
psi.* 
would 
be 
ambiguous 
between 
two 
propositions, 
namely: 


(iv) 
*something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
John 
believes 
that 
x 
has 
psi*. 
and 


(v) 
* 
John 
believes 
that 
something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
has 
psi*. 
So 
if, 
as 
Frege 
believes, 
the 
concept 
phi 
is 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
sentences 
containing 
*the 
phi*, 
then 
*the 
phi* 
is 
acting 
like 
a 
quantifier 
and 
it 
is 
doing 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
both 
direct 
and 
indirect 
contexts. 
So 
Frege’s 
view 
actually 
requires 
that 
we 
not 
suppose 
that 
*the 
phi* 
undergo 
some 
kind 
of 
semantic 
shift 
in 
oblique 
context. 
Frege’s 
view 
that 
*the 
phi* 
does 
undergo 
such 
shifts 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
this 
view 
that 
it 
is 
the 
concept 
phi, 
and 
not 
O 
(the 
unique 
thing 
which 
has 
phi), 
that 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
a 
sentence 
of 
the 
form 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi*. 



§ 
I 
believe 
that 
we 
have 
stumbled 
on 
a 
matter 
of 
some 
importance. 
Some 
terminology 
will 
help. 
As 
we’ve 
discussed, 
Frege 
holds 
the 
sense 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by: 
* 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi*. 
Let 
us 
refer 
to 
this 
as 
Frege’s 
Fundamental 
Assumption 
(FFA). 


(FFA) 
Suppose 
that 
O 
is 
the 
unique 
phi. 
When 
*the 
phi* 
is 
a 
part 
of 
a 
sentence, 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
corresponding 
proposition 
is 
the 
sense 
of 
*the 
phi*, 
and 
not 
O 
itself. 


Here 
is 
a 
more 
formal 
way 
of 
putting 
(FFA). 
In 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
*…the 
phi…*, 
it 
is 
the 
case 
that 
a 
sentence 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
has 
the 
sense 
of 
*the 
phi* 
as 
a 
constituent; 
and 
it 
is 
not 
the 
case 
that, 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
that 
form, 
a 
sentence 
has 
O 
has 
a 
constituent. 


What 
is 
not 
often 
realized 
is 
that, 
if 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
*the 
phi* 
is 
doing 
the 
very 
same 
thing 
in 
both 
direct 
and 
indirect 
contexts. 
Suppose 
FFA 
is 
right. 
Now 
consider 
the 
following 
sentence: 


(ibfs) 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored." 


Because 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
occurs 
in 
(ibfs), 
the 
proposition 
thereby 
meant 
has 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
as 
a 
constituent. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(ibfs) 
is 
identical 
with, 
or 
at 
least 
logically 
equivalent 
to: 


(ifbsP) 
something 
uniquely 
x 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
snored. 


Now 
consider 
the 
sentence: 


(jifbs) 
John 
believes 
that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored." 


Because 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
occurs 
in 
(jibfs), 
the 
proposition 
thereby 
meant 
has 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
as 
a 
constituent. 
If, 
as 
Frege 
maintains, 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
description 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(jifbs), 
then 
that 
sentence 
is 
ambiguous. 
On 
one 
reading, 
the 
proposition 
thereby 
meant 
is 
identical, 
or 
at 
least 
logically 
equivalent, 
with: 



(jifbsW) 
Something 
uniquely 
x 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
John 
believes 
that 
x 
snored. 


On 
the 
other 
reading, 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(jibfs) 
is 
identical 
with, 
or 
at 
least 
logically 
equivalent 
to: 


(jifbsN) 
John 
believes 
that 
something 
uniquely 
x 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
snored. 


If 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
there 
is 
one 
rule 
for 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals". 
That 
rule 
is: 


(*) 
For 
any 
property 
psi, 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snores* 
is 
(logically 
equivalent 
to): 
something 
uniquely 
x 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
has 
psi. 


If 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
occurs 
in 
a 
molecular 
sentence, 
there 
will 
be 
two 
different 
ways 
to 
apply 
(*). 
There 
will 
be 
a 
wide-scope 
application 
and 
a 
narrow-scope 
application. 
But 
there 
will 
still 
be 
just 
one 
rule 
that 
applies 
to 
all 
contexts, 
whether 
direct 
or 
indirect. 


Let 
us 
sum 
up 
this 
leg 
of 
the 
argument. 
Supose 
FFA 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
*the 
phi* 
does 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
indirect 
contexts 
that 
it 
does 
in 
direct 
contexts. 
In 
every 
case, 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
definite 
description: 
and 
the 
sense 
doesn’t 
change 
depending 
on 
the 
context. 
In 
direct 
contexts, 
the 
sense 
that 
makes 
it 
in 
is 
the 
concept 
phi 
(or 
perhaps 
unique 
phi); 
and 
the 
same 
is 
true 
in 
indirect 
contexts. 


Now 
we 
can 
close 
the 
argument. 
If 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
in 
indirect 
contexts 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
Franklin. 
Let 
me 
clarify 
this. 
It 
is 
essential 
to 
Frege’s 
semantics 
that 
the 
following 
expressions 
refer 
to 
different 
propositions: 


(1) 
"That 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
(2) 
"That 
the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored". 
If 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
really 
do 
refer 
to 
different 
propositions, 
then 
compositionality 
demands 
that 
we 
not 
see 
the 
definite 
descriptions 
therein 
as 



referring 
to 
a 
person. 
We’ve 
just 
seen 
that, 
if 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
what 
the 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
doing 
in 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
is 
exactly 
what 
they 
are 
doing 
in 
direct 
contexts 
like 
(ibfs) 
and 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored". 
Since 
they 
are 
not 
referring 
to 
Franklin 
in 
(1) 
and 
(2), 
we 
must 
conclude 
they 
don’t 
so 
refer 
in 
direct 
contexts 
either. 
Basically, 
if 
we 
accept 
FFA, 
then 
we 
must 
deny 
that 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
ever 
singular 
terms. 
Moreover, 
if 
we 
accept 
FFA, 
Frege’s 
idea 
that 
definite 
descriptions 
undergo 
some 
kind 
of 
meaning-shift 
in 
indirect 
contexts 
becomes 
unnecessary: 
in 
fact, 
it 
becomes 
de 
rigueur 
not 
to 
hold 
that. 
For 
given 
FFA, 
*the 
phi* 
is 
doing 
the 
very 
same 
thing 
in 
both 
direct 
and 
indirect 
contexts. 


There 
is 
another 
way 
of 
looking 
at 
this. 
Suppose 
that 
we 
(incoherently) 
accept 
both 
FFA 
and 
the 
view 
that 
*the 
phi* 
is 
a 
singular 
term. 
In 
that 
case, 
as 
Frege 
realized, 
compositionality 
demands 
that 
we 
see 
the 
occurrence 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
as 
referring 
to 
one 
thing, 
and 
its 
occurrence 
in 
(ibfs) 
as 
referring 
to 
something 
very 
different. 
And 
we 
must 
see 
it 
as 
referring 
to 
a 
third 
thing 
in: 
"it 
is 
true 
that 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 
That 
is 
counterintuitive. 
Indeed, 
as 
we 
will 
see, 
Davidson 
argued 
compellingly 
that 
it 
is 
absurd. 
As 
we 
will 
also 
see, 
that 
view 
is 
not 
needed 
to 
accommodate 
either 
compositionality 
or 
facts 
about 
cognitive 
significance. 


§ 
This 
discussion 
leads 
us 
to 
another 
point. 
If 
*the 
phi* 
really 
were 
a 
referring 
term, 
then 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
*the 
phi=the 
chi* 
would 
express 
an 
identity. 
If 
it 
expressed 
an 
identity, 
then 
it 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
logical 
principles 
governing 
identities, 
the 
main 
one 
being 
Leibniz’s 
Law. 
But 
when 
we 
want 
to 
derive 
*the 
chi 
has 
psi* 
from 
*the 
phi=the 
chi, 
and 
the 
phi 
has 
psi*, 
we 
have 
to 
invoke 
logical 
principles 
appropriate 
to 
quantified 
statements 
like 
*something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
also 
has 
psi*. 
So 
if, 
as 
Anderson 
plausibly 
maintains, 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
its 
Russellian 
paraphrase, 
then 
from 
a 
proof-theoretic 
standpoint, 
*the 
phi=the 
chi* 
does 
not 
(merely) 
express 
an 
identity; 
from 
a 
proof-theoretic 
standpoint, 
it 
seems 
to 
express 
a 
complicated 
existence 
claim; 
from 
that 
standpoint 
it 
is 
much 
more 
like 
its 
Russellian 
paraphrase 
than 
it 
is 
like 
anything 
of 
the 
form 
*a=b* 
(where 
a 
and 
b 
are 
proper 
names). 
And 
this 
again 
raises 
the 
question 
how 
*the 
phi* 
could 
be 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
a 
Russellian 
quantifier 
without 
actually 
being 
one. 


We 
have 
to 
distinguish 
identities 
from 
identity-statements. 
Identities 
either 
hold 
necessarily 
or 
they 
don’t 
hold 
at 
all. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
contingently 



self-identical, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
other 
kind 
of 
identity 
besides 
self-identity; 
so 
identities 
hold 
necessarily 
(if 
at 
all). 
But 
the 
truth 
expressed 
by 
a 
so-called 
identity-statement, 
e.g. 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals=the 
first 
post-master 
general", 
may 
be 
contingent. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
a 
statement 
expresses 
a 
contingent 
truth, 
it 
is 
not 
expressing 
an 
identity, 
as 
we 
just 
saw. 
It 
is 
certainly 
arguable 
that 
part 
of 
what 
is 
expressed 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals=the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
is 
an 
identity. 
But 
what 
that 
sentence 
says 
is 
(on 
a 
natural 
readings 
of 
it) 
contingent, 
and 
is 
therefore 
not 
(merely) 
an 
identity. 


It 
seems 
that 
in 
so 
far 
as 
E1 
and 
E2 
really 
co-refer, 
then 
*E1=E2* 
should 
express 
an 
identity 
and, 
therefore, 
a 
necessary 
truth. 
, 
I 
will 
now 
try 
to 
argue 
that 
*E1=E2* 
can 
express 
a 
contingent 
truth 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
it 
does 
not 
express 
an 
identity 
and, 
therefore, 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
are 
not 
co-
referring 
terms. 
If 
E1 
refers 
to 
x, 
then 
surely 
*E1 
has 
phi* 
ascribes 
phi 
to 
x.[3] 
By 
the 
same 
principle, 
if 
E2 
refers 
to 
x, 
then 
*E2 
has 
phi* 
should 
ascribe 
phi 
to 
x. 
One 
property 
that 
can 
be 
ascribed 
to 
a 
thing 
x 
is 
the 
property 
of 
being 
identical 
with 
x. 
So, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
E1 
is 
an 
expression 
that 
refers 
to 
x, 
*E1=E1* 
should 
ascribe 
the 
property 
being 
identical 
with 
x 
to 
x. 
And 
in 
so 
far 
as 
E2 
is 
an 
expression 
that 
refers 
to 
x, 
*E1=E2* 
should 
ascribe 
that 
same 
property 
to 


x. 
So 
in 
so 
far 
as 
E1 
and 
E2 
are 
both 
expressions 
that 
refer 
to 
x, 
*E1=E2* 
must 
express 
a 
necessary 
truth. 
By 
the 
same 
token, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
*E1=E2* 
expresses 
a 
contingent 
truth, 
then 
either 
E1 
or 
E2 
(or 
both) 
is 
doing 
something 
other 
than 
referring 
to 
x. 
Let 
us 
sum 
up. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
suppose 
that, 
as 
Frege 
maintains, 
it 
is 
not 
Franklin 
himself, 
but 
rather 
the 
sense 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 


(*) 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
psi* 


In 
that 
case, 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
that 
sentence 
is 
logically 
equivalent, 
and 
possibly 
even 
identical, 
with: 


(**) 
something 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
has 
psi. 


But 
if 
(**) 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
(*), 
then 
the 
logic 
governing 
definite 
descriptions 
like 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
and 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
is 
very 
different 
from 
the 
logic 
governing 
"Franklin" 
and 
any 
other 
proper 
name 
referring 
to 
Franklin; 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
that 
logic 
will 
be 
a 
lot 
like 



that 
governing 
quantifiers. 
So 
if, 
as 
Frege 
maintains, 
the 
sense 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
sentences 
containing 
that 
expression, 
then 
that 
expression 
is 
a 
quantifier. 
Considerations 
of 
logic, 
especially 
Leibniz’s 
Law, 
compel 
us 
to 
hold 
this. 


Predication 
versus 
Reference 


Of 
course, 
considerations 
of 
Leibniz’s 
law 
were 
not 
Frege’s 
only 
motivation 
for 
his 
view 
that 
*the 
phi* 
refers 
to 
its 
sense 
in 
oblique 
contexts. 
Considerations 
of 
compositionality 
were 
his 
main 
reason. 
But 
considerations 
of 
compositionality 
don’t 
warrant 
that 
view, 
contrary 
to 
what 
is 
generally 
held. 
This 
becomes 
apparent 
when 
we 
discuss 
the 
difference 
between 
predication 
and 
reference. 


In 
this 
context, 
let 
us 
assume 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument 
that 
(FFA) 
is 
correct. 
After 
all, 
if 
FFA 
is 
false, 
then 
so 
ipso 
facto 
is 
Frege’s 
semantics. 


Given 
this, 
consider 
the 
sentence: 


(&) 
"Franklin=the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 


Focus 
on 
the 
expression 
on 
the 
right 
side 
of 
the 
"=". 
What 
does 
that 
expression 
introduce 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(&)? 
(Remember 
that 
we 
are 
operating 
within 
Frege’s 
view 
that, 
when 
*the 
phi* 
occurs 
in 
a 
sentence, 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
in 
question 
is 
the 
sense, 
not 
the 
referent, 
of 
that 
expression.) 
Answer: 
the 
sense 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
– 
the 
concept 
(unique) 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 


Clearly 
(&) 
is 
doing 
much 
more 
than 
ascribing 
the 
property 
of 
being 
identical 
with 
Franklin 
to 
Franklin. 
(Actually, 
it 
isn’t 
clear 
to 
me 
that 
even 
part 
of 
what 
(&) 
does 
is 
ascribe 
self-identity 
to 
Franklin.) 
The 
definite 
description 
has 
what 
Strawson 
described 
as 
a 
"predicational" 
function: 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
unique 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
is 
predicated 
of 
Franklin. 
Perhaps 
we 
can 
see 
the 
definite 
description 
as 
a 
singular 
term 
that 
refers 
to 
Franklin. 
But 
plainly 
it 
is 
also 
functioning 
as 
a 
device 
of 
predication. 
What 
makes 
(&) 
non-trivial 
is 
precisely 
that 
it 
conveys 
the 
message 
that 
Franklin 
invented 
bifocals. 
So 
(&) 
is 
non-trivial 
because 
the 
definite 
description 
picks 
out, 
or 
is 
part 
of 
an 
expression 
that 
picks 
out, 
a 
property. 


In 
so 
far 
as 
the 
definite 
description 
is 
a 
device 
of 
predication, 
it 
seems 
natural 
to 
see 
it 
as 
picking 
out 
a 
property, 
and 
not 
(merely) 
a 
person. 
It 



is 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
see 
how 
*x=the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals* 
could 
ascribe 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
unique 
bifocal 
inventor 
to 
x 
unless 
the 
"=the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
picked 
out 
that 
property; 
and 
it’s 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
see 
how 
that 
expression 
could 
pick 
out 
that 
property 
if 
the 
definite 
description 
did 
not, 
in 
its 
turn, 
pick 
out 
at 
least 
some 
of 
the 
properties 
constitutive 
of 
that 
property. 
So 
I 
am 
not 
completely 
out 
on 
a 
limb 
when 
I 
say 
that, 
in 
functioning 
predicatively, 
the 
definite 
description 
in 
(&) 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
(inter 
alia) 
picking 
out 
a 
property 
(or 
multiple 
properties). 
This 
is 
not 
to 
deny 
that 
it 
does 
pick 
out 
a 
person. 
But 
it 
apparently 
also 
has 
a 
predicative 
function, 
and 
thus 
picks 
out 
a 
property. 
So 
the 
extent 
that 
definite 
descriptions 
function 
predicatively, 
they 
do 
not 
merely 
refer 
to 
individuals. 
That 
is 
probably 
part 
of 
what 
they 
do; 
but 
they 
also, 
so 
it 
appears, 
pick 
out 
properties. 


If 
this 
is 
right, 
then 
it 
is 
highly 
misleading 
to 
say 
that 
"the 
first 
postmaster 
general" 
co-refers 
with 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals". 
At 
most 
we 
could 
say 
that 
they 
partially 
co-refer: 
each 
refers 
to 
Franklin, 
among 
other 
things. 
But 
since 
each 
obviously 
picks 
out 
a 
property 
as 
well 
– 
a 
different 
property 
in 
each 
case 
– 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
say 
that 
on 
the 
whole 
they 
co-refer. 
So 
to 
that 
extent, 
they 
diverge 
in 
reference. 


So 
if 
we 
accept 
Frege’s 
own 
semantics, 
then 
we 
must 
say 
that 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
and 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
do 
not 
co-refer. 
If 
we 
accept 
Frege’s 
views 
about 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals/the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored", 
then 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
reject 
Frege’s 
view 
that 
the 
definite 
descriptions 
in 
question 
co-
refer. 


There 
is 
more 
to 
say 
in 
this 
connection. 
( 
Let 
us 
continue 
to 
suppose 
that 
(FFA) 
is 
right.) 
It 
is 
not 
just 
in 
the 
context 
of 
identity-statements 
that 
definite 
descriptions 
have 
a 
predicative 
function. 
It 
seems 
that 
they 
always 
have 
such 
a 
function. 
Consider 
our 
paradigm: 


(IBS) 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 


This 
certainly 
says 
(in 
some 
reasonable 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
"says") 
that 
somebody 
or 
other 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
that 
any 
such 
person 
snored. 
So 
the 
definite 
description 
is 
attributing 
a 
property 
to 
someone. 
In 
any 
case, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
(IBS) 
differs 
in 
cognitive 
value 
from 


(FS) 
"Franklin 
snored", 



it 
is 
because 
(IBS) 
is 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
someone 
or 
other 
invented 
bifocals, 
whereas 
(FS) 
does 
not. 
So 
in 
so 
far 
as 
those 
sentences 
have 
different 
cognitive 
values, 
it 
is 
because 
the 
definite 
description 
in 
(IBS) 
ascribes 
a 
property 
to 
someone 
or 
other 
– 
it 
is 
because 
the 
definite 
description 
is 
functioning 
predicatively. 
Given 
that 
it 
is 
so 
functioning, 
it 
is 
not 
absurd 
to 
see 
it 
as 
picking 
out 
a 
property 
(that 
of 
being 
a 
unique 
bi-focal 
inventor). 
By 
exactly 
similar 
reasoning, 
it 
is 
not 
implausible 
to 
see 
the 
definite 
description 
in: 


(PGS) 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored" 


as 
functioning 
predicatively 
and 
thus 
as 
inter 
alia 
picking 
out 
a 
property. 
Of 
course, 
the 
property 
picked 
out 
would 
be 
different 
from 
that 
picked 
out 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals". 
So 
even 
though 
there 
is 
overwhelming 
evidence 
to 
support 
the 
view 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
and 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
both 
refer 
to 
Franklin, 
there 
is 
also 
evidence 
to 
suggest 
that 
they 
also 
refer 
to 
other 
things, 
different 
things 
in 
each 
case. 
So 
even 
though 
they 
both 
refer 
to 
Franklin, 
neither 
just 
refers 
to 
Franklin, 
and 
on 
the 
whole 
they 
do 
not 
co-refer: 
they 
overlap 
in 
reference. 
So 
the 
steps 
in 
the 
Slingshot 
that 
depend 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
they 
(and 
other 
such 
pairs) 
"co-refer" 
involve, 
I 
believe, 
a 
muddle. 
Saying 
that 
those 
expressions 
co-refer 
is 
like 
saying 
that 
"Bill 
and 
Ted" 
and 
"Bill 
and 
Steve" 
co-refer. 


So 
far 
as 
I 
can 
tell, 
the 
only 
way 
to 
block 
this 
conclusion 
is 
to 
say 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
can 
function 
predicatively 
without 
referring 
to 
any 
property. 
In 
defense 
of 
such 
a 
position, 
it 
might 
be 
said 
that 
it 
"expresses" 
or 
perhaps 
"connotes" 
a 
property 
without 
actually 
referring 
to 
it. 
But 
this 
move 
puts 
a 
lot 
of 
weight 
on 
what, 
arguably, 
is 
a 
mere 
matter 
of 
nomenclature. 
When 
you 
say 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
expresses 
or 
connotes 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
unique 
bifocal 
inventor, 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
is 
that 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi* 
says, 
or 
at 
least 
implies, 
that 
somebody 
or 
other 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
that 
any 
such 
person 
has 
phi.[4] 


So 
it 
is 
obviously 
part 
of 
the 
semantics 
of 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi* 
that 
it 
implies, 
if 
it 
doesn’t 
outright 
say, 
that 
somebody 
or 
other 
invented 
bifocals: 
we 
don’t 
need 
to 
invoke 
any 
logic 
to 
establish 
this 
connection. 
So 
it 
is 
part 
of 
the 
semantics 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
that 



*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi* 
ascribes 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
bifocal 
inventor 
to 
someone. 
Given 
this, 
it 
is 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
see 
how 
that 
expression 
could 
fail 
to 
pick 
out 
that 
property. 
We 
can 
use 
the 
term 
"express" 
to 
describe 
this 
picking 
out. 
But 
a 
picking 
out 
– 
a 
referring 
– 
is 
what 
we 
are 
dealing 
with. 
This 
is 
not 
to 
deny 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
also 
picks 
out 
Franklin 
– 
my 
own 
view 
is 
that 
it 
does 
pick 
him 
out. 
But 
it 
obviously 
doesn’t 
only 
do 
that; 
and 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
doesn’t 
only 
do 
that, 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
a 
predicative 
function, 
and 
therefore 
would 
appear 
to 
pick 
out 
properties. 
For 
exactly 
similar 
reasons, 
it 
is 
not 
implausible 
to 
see 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
as 
picking 
out, 
not 
only 
Franklin, 
but 
also 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
first-postmaster 
general 
– 
this 
being 
a 
property 
not 
picked 
out 
by 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals". 


Let 
us 
sum 
up. 
Suppose 
(FFA) 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
it 
follows, 
ironically, 
that 
those 
expressions 
don’t 
co-refer: 
they 
end 
up 
referring 
to 
different 
properties. 
(Montague 
would 
say 
that 
they 
refer 
to 
different 
functions. 
But 
we’ll 
see 
that 
these 
views 
collapse 
into 
each 
other.) 
So 
we 
would 
be 
forced 
to 
deny 
Frege’s 
other 
view 
– 
his 
belief 
that 
they 
are 
co-
referring 
singular 
terms. 
So 
Frege’s 
system 
is 
self-contradictory. 


Further, 
more 
importantly, 
this 
shows 
that 
compositionality 
does 
not 
require 
us 
to 
see 
sentences 
as 
referring 
to 
truth-values 
even 
if 
we 
grant 
Frege’s 
fundamental 
assumption. 
Even 
if 
we 
grant 
(FFA), 
when 
we 
have 
two 
expressions 
that 
have 
different 
senses 
but 
allegedly 
co-refer, 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
they 
refer 
to 
different 
properties. 


Some 
other 
inconsistencies 
in 
the 
Fregean 
View 


According 
to 
Frege, 
"the 
king 
of 
France 
is 
bald" 
presupposes 
but 
does 
not 
itself 
affirm, 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
king 
of 
France. 
This 
means 
that 
if 
there 
is 
no 
king 
of 
France, 
then 
that 
sentence 
is 
without 
truth-value. 


This 
is 
certainly 
a 
reasonable 
position 
--one 
I 
myself 
will 
defend. 
But 
it 
is 
not 
consistent 
with 
Frege’s 
Fundamental 
Assumption. 
Suppose 
FFA 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
as 
we’ve 
seen, 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with: 
"something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
also 
has 
psi.* 
In 
particular, 


(i) 
"The 
king 
of 
France 
is 
bald" 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with: 



(ii) 
"Something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
a 
king 
of 
France, 
and 
x 
is 
also 
bald." 
If 
there 
is 
no 
king 
of 
France, 
then 
(ii) 
is 
false. 
The 
absence 
of 
a 
king 
of 
France 
doesn’t 
make 
(ii) 
without 
truth-value 
at 
all. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
any 
sentence 
S 
encoding 
a 
proposition 
logically 
equivalent 
with: 
something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
a 
king 
of 
France, 
and 
x 
is 
also 
bald. 
So 
any 
such 
sentence 
does 
not 
presuppose 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
king 
of 
France, 
but 
actually 
affirms 
it. 
So 
Frege 
is 
guilty 
of 
inconsistency. 


This 
criticism 
is 
not 
an 
ad 
hominem 
attack 
on 
Frege’s 
particular 
system; 
it 
has 
more 
general 
consequences 
for 
semantics. 
If 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
*the 
phi* 
asserts 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
unique 
phi. 
But 
in 
that 
case, 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
simply 
false 
if 
there 
is 
no 
(unique) 
phi, 
meaning 
that 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
does 
not 
presuppose 
existence 
of 
a 
phi. 
In 
that 
case, 
*the 
phi* 
does 
not 
refer 
at 
all: 
where 
there 
is 
reference, 
there 
is 
a 
presupposition 
of 
existence, 
not 
an 
affirmation 
of 
it. 
If 
you 
say 
"that 
man 
[pointing 
to 
Fred] 
is 
a 
scoundrel", 
you 
are 
not 
affirming 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
contextually 
salient 
man; 
you 
are 
presupposing 
it. 
If 
you 
say 
"George’s 
literary 
career 
is 
really 
coming 
along", 
you 
are 
not 
affirming, 
but 
presupposing, 
George’s 
existence. 
Given 
any 
clear 
case 
of 
reference, 
we 
see 
that 
referring 
presupposes 
existence, 
and 
doesn’t 
assert 
it. 
So 
if 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
*the 
phi* 
is 
not 
a 
singular 
term, 
contrary 
to 
what 
Frege 
held. 
If 
we 
are 
to 
hold 
onto 
FFA, 
then 
we 
must 
jettison 
the 
idea 
that 
*the 
phi* 
is 
a 
singular 
term; 
we 
must 
see 
it 
as 
affirming 
existence: 
we 
must 
see 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
as 
meaning: 
something 
x 
uniquely 
has 
phi, 
and 
x 
also 
has 
psi. 
So 
we 
must 
see 
*the 
phi* 
as 
being 
a 
quantifier 
– 
we 
must 
accept 
the 
Theory 
of 
Descriptions. 


I 
wish 
to 
make 
my 
own 
position 
clear. 
I 
think 
that 
if 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
one 
must 
accept 
the 
Theory 
of 
Descriptions. 
But 
I 
think 
that 
both 
FFA 
and 
the 
Theory 
of 
Descriptions. 
I 
believe 
they 
both 
confuse 
semantics 
with 
pre-semantics 
and, 
what 
is 
closely 
related, 
type-semantics 
with 
token-
semantics. 


Is 
"reference" 
an 
ambiguous 
term? 
Does 
Anderson’s 
semantics 
make 
it 
ambiguous? 



Anderson’s 
position 
is 
this. 
*The 
phi* 
is 
a 
singular 
term 
but 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
its 
Russellian 
paraphrase. 
Strictly 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
Anderson 
is 
right 
about 
this. 


Let 
us 
now 
invent 
an 
expression 
such 
that, 
by 
our 
stipulation, 
what 
Russell 
said 
about 
*the 
phi* 
is 
actually 
true 
of 
that 
other 
expression. 
Let 
*the# 
phi* 
be 
an 
expression 
such 
that 
everything 
Russell 
said 
about 
*the 
phi* 
is 
true 
of 
*the# 
phi*. 


Now 
consider: 


(i) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snores", 
and 
(ii) 
"The# 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snores". 
The 
relation 
that 
Franklin’s 
snoring 
(or 
not 
snoring) 
has 
to 
the 
truth-
value 
of 
the 
one 
sentence 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
relation 
that 
it 
has 
to 
the 
truth-
value 
of 
the 
other. 
E 
sentence 
expresses 
a 
proposition 
P 
that 
exists, 
and 
can 
be 
true 
or 
false, 
in 
worlds 
where 
Franklin 
doesn’t 
exist; 
each 
expresses 
a 
proposition 
that 
is 
true 
in 
worlds 
where 
Franklin 
uniquely 
invents 
bifocals 
and 
does 
snore, 
and 
that 
is 
false 
in 
worlds 
where 
Franklin 
uniquely 
invents 
bifocals 
and 
does 
not 
snore. 
In 
general, 
supposing 
that 
O 
is 
the 
unique 
phi, 
the 
relevance 
of 
facts 
about 
O 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
*…the 
phi…* 
will 
be 
identical 
with 
the 
relevance 
of 
such 
facts 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
*....the# 
phi…* 
So 
it’s 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
see 
how 
*the 
phi*, 
as 
Anderson 
analyses 
it, 
is 
significantly 
different 
from 
a 
Russellian 
quantifier. 


Admittedly, 
this 
by 
itself 
is 
not 
probative. 
Let 
us 
stipulate 
that 
"Socrates#" 
is 
to 
be 
defined 
as 
follows: 


*Socrates# 
has 
phi* 
means: 
something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
has 
phi. 


So 
"Socrates#" 
is 
a 
quantifier, 
even 
though 
"Socrates" 
is 
not. 
Now 
the 
relevance 
which 
Socrates’ 
snoring 
(or 
not 
snoring) 
has 
to: 


(&) 
"Socrates 
snored" 



is 
identical 
with 
that 
which 
it 
has 
to: 


(&&) 
"Socrates# 
snored". 


But 
"Socrates#" 
is 
a 
quantifier, 
whereas 
"Socrates" 
is 
not. 
So, 
to 
close 
the 
argument, 
the 
point 
just 
made 
about 
Franklin’s 
relevance 
to 
(i) 
and 


(ii) 
doesn’t 
settle 
whether 
"the 
phi" 
(as 
Anderson 
analyses 
it) 
is 
a 
quantifier 
or 
not. 
What 
are 
we 
to 
say 
in 
response 
to 
this? 
First 
of 
all, 
notice 
that, 
if 
a 
sentence 
comprises 
an 
occurrence 
of 
"Socrates#", 
that 
sentence 
has 
for 
its 
meaning 
a 
proposition 
that 
has 
Socrates 
himself 
as 
a 
constituent. 
As 
a 
whole, 
"Socrates#" 
is 
a 
quantifier, 
and 
not 
a 
singular 
term 
referring 
to 
Socrates. 
But, 
for 
the 
reason 
just 
described, 
it 
is 
not 
out 
of 
the 
question 
to 
see 
Socrates 
as 
part 
of 
what 
"Socrates#" 
denotes. 


It 
seems 
to 
me 
(though 
here 
I 
am 
entering 
into 
the 
vagaries 
of 
psychology) 
that 
a 
person 
can 
understand 
"Socrates 
snored", 
and 
know 
that 
it 
is 
true, 
without 
knowing 
that: 


(%) 
somebody 
x 
uniquely 
was 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
snored. 


Permit 
me 
a 
bit 
of 
science-fiction. 
Suppose 
that 
Smith 
has 
strange 
cognitive 
deficits 
whereby 
he 
can 
grasp 
singular 
propositions 
(like 
Franklin 
smokes), 
but 
not 
general 
propositions 
(like 
all 
men 
smoke). 
It 
is 
conceivable 
that 
animals 
are 
in 
such 
a 
position. 
(I 
am 
fairly 
certain 
that 
squirrels 
grasp 
singular 
propositions, 
like 
that 
dog 
is 
eating 
my 
acorn, 
but 
I 
have 
some 
doubts 
about 
whether 
they 
can 
grasp 
generalizations 
of 
such 
propositions.) 
Smith 
would, 
I 
think, 
be 
able 
to 
understand 
(&), 
but 
not 
(&&). 
So 
the 
semantic 
or 
linguistic 
competence 
needed 
to 
understand 
– 
to 
grasp 
the 
meaning 
of 
--(&) 
is 
not 
sufficient 
for 
a 
grasp 
of 
(&&). 
Somebody 
who 
understands 
(&) 
needs 
to 
call 
on 
extra-semantic 
logical 
acumen 
to 
see 
that 
it 
entails 
(%); 
linguistic 
competence 
is 
not 
enough. 


Let 
me 
put 
this 
another 
way. 
"Socrates 
snored" 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
Socrates 
snored. 
This 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
semantics: 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
right 
bit 
of 
linguistic 
or 
semantic 
competence, 
one 
knows 
that 
"Socrates 
snored" 
is 
true 
iff 
Socrates 
snored. 
For 
obvious 
reasons, 
"Socrates 
snored" 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
somebody 
x 
is 
uniquely 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
snored. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
logic, 
not 
(merely) 
of 
semantics. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 



"Socrates 
snores" 
is 
simply: 
"Socrates 
snored" 
means 
Socrates 
snored 
(or 
is 
true 
iff 
Socrates 
snored). 
The 
semantic 
rule 
doesn’t 
involve 
any 
mention 
of 
quantifiers 
or 
identity. 
So 
the 
bit 
of 
semantic 
competence 
that 
is 
needed 
to 
understand 
"Socrates 
snored" 
is 
not, 
by 
itself, 
sufficient 
for 
knowing 
that 
"Socrates 
snored" 
is 
true 
iff 
something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
identical 
with 
Socrates, 
and 
x 
snored. 
This 
gives 
us 
some 
reason 
to 
think 
that 
what 
"Socrates 
snored" 
means 
is 
not 
that 
existence 
claim, 
or 
(by 
a 
similar 
argument) 
any 
other 
quantified 
statement, 
even 
though 
what 
it 
means 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
that 
claim; 
and, 
therefore, 
that 
"Socrates" 
isn’t 
a 
quantifier 
(even 
though 
it 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
one). 


A 
slight 
digression 
may 
help. 
"John 
has 
two 
apples" 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 


@) 
either 
there 
are 
square 
circles 
or 
the 
number 
n 
such 
that 
John 
has 
n 
apples 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
number 
of 
square 
roots 
of 
a 
positive 
number. 


But 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"John 
has 
two 
apples" 
is 
just 
– 
that 
sentence 
means 
(or 
is 
true 
iff) 
John 
has 
two 
apples. 
There 
is 
no 
mention 
of 
square 
roots 
or 
the 
property 
of 
being 
a 
positive 
integer. 
So 
the 
connection 
between 
"John 
has 
two 
apples" 
and 
@ 
is 
not 
(merely) 
semantic; 
extra-semantic 
(mathematical) 
principles 
have 
to 
be 
brought 
in. 


It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
(&) 
and 
(&&) 
don’t 
differ 
from 
each 
other 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
"Socrates 
snored" 
and 
"Socrates# 
snored" 
differ. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
semantics, 
(&) 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
something 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals 
and 
x 
snores. 
And 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
(&&). 
The 
equivalence 
between 
(&) 
and 
(&&) 
seems 
not 
to 
be 
comparable 
to 
the 
equivalence 
between 
@ 
and 
"John 
has 
two 
apples" 
or 
to 
that 
between 
"Socrates 
snored" 
and 
"Socrates# 
snored". 
The 
latter 
equivalences 
are 
mediated 
by 
extra-semantic, 
logical 
principles. 
The 
first 
equivalence 
seems 
to 
be 
purely 
semantic. 


The 
Possible 
Ambiguity 
of 
the 
term 
"Reference" 
and 
the 
Distinction 
between 
Rigid 
and 
Non-rigid 
Designation 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
let 
us 
continue 
to 
suppose 
that 
Anderson’s 
analysis 
of 
definite 
descriptions 
is 
correct. 


In 
that 
case, 
the 
relation 
that 
holds 
between 
"Franklin" 
and 
Franklin 



is 
very 
different 
from 
that 
which 
holds 
between 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
and 
Franklin. 
"Franklin 
snores" 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
Franklin 
snores. 
It 
is 
irrelevant 
if 
Smith 
snores 
or 
if 
Jones 
doesn’t 
snore. 
All 
of 
this 
is 
obviously 
bound 
up 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
"Franklin" 
refers 
to 
Franklin. 
If 
"Franklin 
snores" 
were 
made 
true 
by 
Smith’s 
snoring, 
then 
(holding 
constant 
the 
other 
semantic 
rules 
of 
English), 
"Franklin" 
would 
refer 
to 
Smith. 


Now 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snores" 
is 
true 
in 
worlds 
where 
Franklin 
doesn’t 
exist, 
and 
it 
is 
true 
in 
worlds 
where 
he 
does 
exist 
but 
doesn’t 
snore. 
The 
most 
that 
can 
be 
said 
is 
that 
if 
Franklin 
is 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals, 
then 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snores" 
is 
true 
iff 
Franklin 
snores. 
But 
the 
same 
can 
be 
said 
of 
anything. 
It 
is 
true 
that 
if 
Bill 
Clinton 
is 
the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals, 
then 
that 
sentence 
is 
true 
iff 
Clinton 
snores. 
The 
semantic 
relation 
between 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general" 
and 
Franklin 
is 
extremely 
loose. 


It 
is 
pretty 
clear 
that, 
in 
the 
sentence 
"some 
one 
person 
invented 
bifocals", 
there 
is 
nothing 
that 
refers 
to 
Franklin.[5] 
It 
seems 
that 
the 
very 
considerations 
which 
establish 
this 
also 
establish 
that 
nothing 
refers 
to 
Franklin 
in 
the 
sentence 
"something 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
snored". 
And 
it’s 
a 
little 
hard 
to 
see 
why 
those 
same 
considerations 
wouldn’t 
establish 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
the 
case 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 


In 
any 
case, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
relation 
between 
"Franklin" 
and 
Franklin 
is 
not 
much 
like 
the 
relation 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
to 
Franklin. 
Given 
this, 
the 
question 
can 
legitimately 
be 
raised 
whether 
we 
are 
rendering 
the 
notion 
of 
reference 
ambiguous 
if 
we 
say 
that 
both 
"Franklin" 
and 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
are 
terms 
that 
"refer" 
to 
Franklin. 


Here 
it 
seems 
reasonable 
to 
reply 
by 
saying 
(as 
Anderson 
does[6]): 
"all 
we’re 
dealing 
with 
here 
is 
the 
distinction 
between 
rigid 
and 
non-rigid 
reference; 
‘Franklin’ 
rigidly, 
and 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
non-rigidly, 
refers 
to 
Franklin." 


There 
are 
two 
points 
to 
make 
in 
response. 
First, 
if 
that 
response 
is 
right, 
then 
there 
are 
very 
good 
reasons 
to 
think 
that 
"non-rigid 
reference" 
isn’t 
reference 
at 
all. 
Supposing 
that 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
(one 
of 
its) 
Russellian 
paraphrase(s), 
we’ve 
seen 
that 
it 
is 
very 
hard 
to 
see 
why 
*the 
phi* 
can 
be 
said 
to 
be 
a 
singular 
term 
at 
all. 
So 
if 
we 
insist 
on 
saying 
that 
*the 
phi* 
"non-rigidly 
refers", 
then 
"non-rigid 
reference" 
is 
just 
another 
way 
of 
saying 
"non-reference". 


§ 
But 
there 
is 
another 
difficulty 
with 
the 
view 
in 
question. 
To 
say 
that 



"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
"non-rigidly" 
refers 
to 
Franklin 
is 
an 
entirely 
different 
thing 
from 
saying 
that 
it 
is 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
its 
Russellian 
counterpart. 
In 
other 
words, 
given 
only 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
non-
rigidly 
refers 
to 
Franklin, 
it 
could 
still 
be 
the 
case 
that 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snores" 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
Franklin 
snores. 
Let 
me 
clarify. 


Demonstratives 
are 
paradigm 
cases 
of 
non-rigid 
designators. 
"You" 
refers 
to 
different 
people 
on 
different 
occasions 
of 
use. 
There 
is 
no 
one 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
any 
given 
token 
of 
*you 
are 
phi* 
means 
that 
x 
has 
phi. 
But 
for 
any 
given 
token 
of 
*you 
have 
phi*, 
there 
is 
some 
x 
such 
that 
that 
token 
means 
x 
has 
phi. 


Let 
us 
consider 
a 
case 
that 
is 
a 
little 
closer 
to 
home. 
Let 
us 
invent 
an 
article 
"the#" 
to 
be 
defined 
as 
follows. 
Let 
w 
be 
an 
arbitrary 
world, 
and 
suppose 
that, 
in 
w, 
O 
is 
the 
unique 
thing 
having 
phi. 
In 
that 
case, 
a 
token 
of 
*the# 
phi 
has 
psi* 
in 
w 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
O 
has 
psi. 
So 
*the# 
phi* 
is 
a 
demonstrative: 
it 
picks 
out 
the 
thing 
which, 
in 
the 
world 
of 
utterance, 
has 
phi; 
and 
*the# 
phi 
has 
psi* 
encodes 
a 
singular 
proposition 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
that 
thing 
has 
psi 
(just 
as 
a 
token 
of 
*you 
have 
psi*, 
addressed 
to 
Fred, 
encodes 
a 
singular 
proposition 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
Fred 
has 
psi). 
So 
"the# 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snores" 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
Franklin 
snored. 
(This 
is 
what 
Strawson 
said 
about 
"the".) 


Obviously 
"the# 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
not 
a 
rigid 
designator. 
In 
w2, 
it 
refers 
to 
Jefferson. 
In 
w3, 
it 
refers 
to 
Hartry 
Field. 
But, 
in 
any 
world 
w, 
a 
token 
of 
"the# 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
means 
O 
snored 
(where 
O 
is 
the 
unique 
inventor 
of 
bifocals). 
So 
even 
if 
an 
expression 
E 
non-rigidly 
refers 
to 
Franklin, 
it 
may 
still 
be 
the 
case 
that 
*E 
snored* 
means: 
Franklin 
snored. 
So 
the 
semantic 
differences 
between 
"Franklin" 
and 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
– 
that 
fact 
that 
"Franklin 
snored" 
means 
Franklin 
snored, 
whereas 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
means 
something 
that 
can 
be 
true 
in 
worlds 
where 
Franklin 
doesn’t 
exist 
or 
does 
exist 
but 
doesn’t 
snore 
--cannot 
be 
dealt 
with 
merely 
by 
saying 
that 
"Franklin" 
rigidly 
denotes 
Franklin, 
whereas 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
non-rigidly 
him. 


§ 
Now 
let 
us 
apply 
the 
points 
just 
made 
to 
the 
Slingshot. 
Suppose 
that 
when 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
occurs 
in 
a 
sentence 
(or 
sentence-token, 
to 
be 
precise), 
the 
resulting 
proposition 
has 
the 
sense 
of 
that 
expression 
as 
a 
constituent. 
In 
other 
words, 
suppose 
that 
FFA 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
"the 



inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
means 
something 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
snored. 
So 
if 
FFA 
is 
right, 
then 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
ends 
up 
being 
a 
quantifier, 
and 
Russell’s 
theory 
of 
descriptions 
is 
right. 
We 
know 
that 
if 
the 
theory 
of 
descriptions 
is 
right, 
then 
every 
form 
of 
the 
Slingshot 
is 
blocked. 
So 
each 
form 
of 
the 
Slingshot 
requires 
that 
FFA 
be 
wrong: 
when 
*the 
phi* 
occurs 
in 
a 
sentence, 
what 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
is 
not 
the 
sense 
of 
that 
expression, 
but 
only 
the 
thing 
(if 
any) 
referred 
to. 
So 
if 
O 
is 
the 
unique 
phi, 
then 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
*the 
phi 
snores* 
is 
simply 
O 
snores. 
And 
(supposing 
that 
O 
also 
uniquely 
has 
property 
chi) 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
*the 
phi 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
chi*, 
is 
simply 
O=O. 
This 
can 
be 
encapsulated 
in 
the 
slogan: 
if 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
singular 
terms, 
they 
are 
directly 
referential. 


(The 
sense 
of 
a 
definite 
description 
would 
still 
have 
an 
important 
semantic 
role: 
but 
that 
role 
would 
simply 
be 
to 
pick 
out 
the 
thing 
which 
makes 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
in 
question, 
and 
that 
sense 
would 
not 
itself 
make 
it 
in 
there. 
Even 
relegated 
to 
that 
role, 
that 
sense 
will 
still 
do 
the 
relevant 
cognitive 
work; 
it 
will 
still 
suffice 
to 
make 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
and 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored" 
convey 
radically 
different 
propositions. 
This 
is 
because, 
as 
we 
will 
see, 
much 
of 
what 
is 
communicated 
by 
an 
utterance 
is 
pre-semantic.) 


Given 
this, 
let 
us 
look 
at 
some 
famous 
Slingshots. 


Church 
1943[7] 


Assume 
both 
(LL) 
and 
(CR). 
Let 
S 
and 
S* 
be 
any 
two 
non-analytic 
sentence-tokens 
that 
have 
the 
same 
truth-value. 


(1) 
S 
(2) 
The 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
S) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x). 
(3) 
The 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
S*) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x). 
(4) 
S*. 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
are 
logically 
equivalent. 
So 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
co-refer. 
(3) 
is 
what 
results 
when 
a 
referring 
term 
in 
(2) 
is 
replaced 
with 
a 
co-referring 
term. 
So 
(2) 
and 
(3) 
co-refer. 
(3) 
and 
(4) 
are 
logically 
equivalent. 
So 
they 
co-refer. 

So 
(1) 
and 
(4) 
co-refer. 
Any 
two 
sentence-tokens, 
alike 
in 
truth-value, 
co-
refer. 


But 
this 
argument 
fails. 
Let 
Omni 
be 
the 
class 
of 
all 
self-identical 
objects. 
If 
that 
argument 
is 
to 
go 
through, 
we 
must 
read 
the 
definite 
descriptions 
as 
singular 
terms. 
But 
remember 
that, 
if 
*the 
phi* 
is 
a 
singular 
term 
referring 
to 
O, 
then 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
O 
has 
psi. 
So 
if 
we 
read 
the 
definite 
descriptions 
as 
singular 
terms, 
we 
have: 


(1R) 
S 
(2 
R) 
Omni=Omni. 
(3 
R) 
Omni=Omni. 
(4 
R) 
S*. 


There 
is 
no 
logical 
equivalence 
between 
the 
first 
two 
steps, 
or 
the 
last 
two. 
The 
argument 
fails. 


Let 
us 
now 
consider 
Church 
1956. 
Let 
us 
assume: 


(CR) 
Replacing 
expressions 
with 
co-referring 
expressions 
cannot 
result 
in 
a 
change 
of 
reference. 


(SR) 
Expressions 
that 
are 
synonymous 
(or 
"very 
nearly 
so") 
co-refer. 


According 
to 
Church 
(1956), 
if 
we 
grant 
these 
principles, 
then 
we 
can 
prove 
that 
sentences 
refer 
to 
truth-values: 


(i) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott. 
(ii) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
the 
author 
of 
Waverly. 
(iii) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
the 
man 
who 
wrote 
twenty-nine 
Waverly 
novels 
altogether. 
(iv) 
The 
number 
n, 
such 
that 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
wrote 
n 
Waverly 
novels, 
is 
twenty-nine. 
(v) 
The 
number 
of 
counties 
in 
Utah 
is 
twenty-nine. 
By 
CR, 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
and 
(iii) 
must 
all 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 


(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
are, 
in 
Church’s 
view, 
synonymous 
(or 
"very 
nearly 
so"). 
Nearly 
synonymous 
expressions 
must 
co-refer. 
So 
(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
co-
refer. 



By 
CR, 
(v) 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
(iv). 


It 
follows 
that 
(i) 
and 
(v) 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 
They 
also 
have 
the 
same 
truth-value. 
Indeed, 
the 
one 
significant 
thing 
that 
(i) 
and 
(v) 
have 
in 
common 
is 
that 
they 
are 
both 
true. 


CR 
preserves 
reference. 
The 
one 
significant 
property 
of 
sentences 
that 
CR 
preserves 
is 
truth-value. 
So 
sentence-reference 
is 
sentence 
truth-
value. 


What 
is 
true 
of 
(i) 
and 
(v) 
is 
true 
(mutatis 
mutandis) 
of 
any 
two 
true 
sentences. 
Let 
S 
and 
S* 
be 
any 
two 
true 
sentences 
you 
choose. 
Given 
CR, 
plus 
the 
innocuous 
principle 
that 
synonymous 
expressions 
co-refer, 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
syntax-chopping 
shows 
that 
S 
and 
S* 
have 
the 
same 
referent. 


Thus 
any 
two 
true 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing: 
the 
property 
of 
truth. 


An 
exactly 
similar 
argument 
shows 
that 
any 
two 
false 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing: 
the 
property 
of 
falsity. 


But 
given 
what 
we’ve 
said 
about 
reference, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
Church’s 
argument 
fails. 
Church 
assumes 
that 
"Scott" 
and 
"the 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
both 
refer 
to 
Scott. 
Suppose 
he 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
for 
reasons 
we’ve 
seen, 
if 
O 
is 
the 
author 
of 
Waverly, 
then 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
*the 
author 
of 
Waverly 
has 
chi* 
is: 
O 
has 
chi. 
So 
if, 
as 
Church 
assumes, 
"the 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
is 
a 
singular 
term 
referring 
to 
Scott: 


(i) 
"Scott 
was 
wise" 
and 


(ii) 
"The 
author 
of 
Waverly 
was 
wise" 
ought 
to 
mean 
the 
same 
thing. 
They 
both 
ought 
to 
mean: 


(iii) 
Scott 
was 
wise. 
So 
lines 
(i) 
and 
(ii) 
must 
both 
mean: 


(iR) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 



Church 
assumes 
that 
"twenty-nine" 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
"The 
number 
of 
counties 
in 
Utah" 
and 
also 
"the 
number 
n, 
such 
that 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
wrote 
n 
Waverly 
novels". 
He 
assumes 
they 
all 
refer 
to 
the 
number 
twenty-nine. 


Let 
us 
suppose 
he 
is 
right. 
In 
that 
case, 
by 
reasoning 
exactly 
similar 
to 
that 
just 
given, 
lines 
(iii)-(v) 
must 
all 
mean:

are 
not

The 
argument 
fails. 


A 
Salmon-Kripke 
reply 


I 
must 
consider 
a 
response 
to 
my 
argument 
(due 
to 
Nathan 
Salmon): 


Here 
is 
a 
response 
to 
your 
argument. 
Never 
mind 
English 
definite 
descriptions. 
Instead 
we 
introduce 
an 
artificial 
device 
"ze" 
that 
works 
according 
to 
the 
following 
rule: 
*ze 
phi*[8] 
refers 
to 
the 
unique 
individual 
that 
satisfies 
(has) 
phi, 
if 
there 
is 
such 
an 
individual, 
and 
fails 
to 
refer 
otherwise. 
In 
that 
case 
"Scott" 
and 
"ze 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
are 
co-referential. 
Now 
replace 
"the" 
through 
Church’s 
(or 
Frege’s) 
argument 
with 
"ze". 
The 
resulting 
argument 
is 
immune 
to 
what 
you’ve 
said. 



Let 
us 
see 
how 
well 
this 
proposal 
fairs. 


(i) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott. 
(ii) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
ze 
author 
of 
Waverly. 
(iii) 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
is 
ze 
man 
who 
wrote 
twenty-nine 
Waverly 
novels 
altogether. 
(iv) 
Ze 
number 
n, 
such 
that 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
wrote 
n 
Waverly 
novels, 
is 
twenty-nine. 
(v) 
Ze 
number 
of 
counties 
in 
Utah 
is 
twenty-nine. 
Of 
course, 
"ze 
author 
of 
Waverly" 
contributes 
the 
very 
same 
thing 
as 
"Scott". 
They 
both 
contribute 
Scott. 
So 
the 
proposition 
encoded 
in 
(ii) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
proposition 
encoded 
in 
(i). 


"Ze 
man 
who 
wrote 
twenty-nine 
Waverly 
novels 
altogether" 
contributes 
Scott. 
So 
(iii) 
encodes 
the 
same 
proposition 
(ii) 
and 
as 
(i). 


"Ze 
number 
n, 
such 
that 
Sir 
Walter 
Scott 
wrote 
n 
Waverly 
novels" 
refers 
to/contributes 
the 
number 
twenty-nine. 
So 
(iv) 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
twenty-nine 
is 
twenty-nine. 


"Ze 
number 
of 
counties 
in 
Utah" 
refers 
to/contributes 
the 
number 
twenty-nine. 
So 
(v) 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
twenty-nine 
is 
twenty-nine. 


So 
when 
we 
rewrite 
Church’s 
argument, 
replacing 
"the" 
with 
"ze", 
and 
consider 
the 
propositions 
encoded 
in 
the 
resulting 
sentences, 
the 
result 
is 
this: 


(i) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 
(ii) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 
(iii) 
Scott 
is 
Scott. 
(iv) 
Twenty-nine 
is 
twenty-nine. 
(v) 
Twenty-nine 
is 
twenty-nine. 
(iii) 
and 
(iv) 
are 
not 
synonymous, 
or 
"very 
nearly 
so". 
So 
the 
argument 
fails. 

Let 
us 
refer 
to 
expressions 
of 
the 
form 
"ze 
phi" 
as 
"zefinite 


descriptions". 


By 
our 
stipulation, 
"ze 
unique 
x 
such 
that 
1+1=2 
and 
x=Plato" 
semantically 
contributes 
Plato 
and 
Plato 
alone. 
So 
"Plato 
snores" 
is 
synonymous 
with 
"ze 
unique 
x 
such 
that 
(1+1=2 
and 
x=Plato) 
snores" 
and 
with 
"ze 
unique 
x 
such 
that 
(arithmetic 
is 
incomplete 
and 
x=Plato) 
smokes." 
This 
blocks 
Frege’s 
argument. 


In 
general, 
replacing 
a 
referring 
term 
with 
a 
co-referring 
zefinitedescription 
preserves 
meaning. 
Replacing 
definite 
descriptions 
with 
zefinite 
descriptions 
will 
not 
help 
any 
slingshot; 
it 
will 
actually 
ensure 
that 
meaning 
is 
preserved 
and 
will 
prevent 
the 
divergence 
of 
meaning 
from 
truth-value 
that 
slingshots 
depend 
on. 


Davidson 
1967[9] 


Assume 
(LL) 
and 
also 
that 
"logically 
equivalent 
expressions 
co-
refer". 
Pick 
any 
two 
true 
sentence-tokens. 
Pick, 
say, 
"grass 
is 
green" 
and 
"whales 
are 
mammals". 
(I)-(IV) 
are 
meant 
to 
be 
sentence-tokens, 
not 
propositions: 


(I) 
grass 
is 
green. 
(II) 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
grass 
is 
green) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x). 
(III) 
(x=x 
and 
whales 
are 
mammals) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x). 
(IV) 
whales 
are 
mammals. 
(I) 
and 
(II) 
must 
co-refer. 
For 
given 
(LL), 
"grass 
is 
green" 
must 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
"the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
grass 
is 
green) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x)". 
So, 
given 
(CR), 
(I) 
and 
(II) 
co-refer. 
(II) 
and 
(III) 
co-refer 
for 
the 
same 
reason. 
And 
(III) 
and 
(IV) 
co-refer 
for 
the 
same 
reason. 
So 
(I) 
and 
(IV) 
co-refer. 
Any 
two 
true 
sentences 
co-refer. 
Given 
this, 
suppose 
that 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
facts 
or 
states 
of 



affairs 
that 
they 
indicate. 
Suppose, 
for 
example, 
"grass 
is 
green" 
refers 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
grass 
is 
green. 
In 
that 
case, 
it 
follows 
that 
"grass 
is 
green" 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
fact 
as 
"whales 
are 
mammals". 
It 
follows 
that 
any 
two 
true 
sentences 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
fact. 
Davidson 
bases 
far-reaching 
conclusions 
about 
semantics 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
fact 
(no 
pun 
intended). 


But 
no 
such 
conclusions 
are 
warranted, 
at 
least 
not 
by 
this 
argument. 
Again, 
let 
Omni 
be 
the 
class 
of 
self-identical 
things. 
If 
Davidson’s 
argument 
is 
to 
go 
through, 
definite 
descriptions 
must 
be 
treated 
as 
singular 
terms. 
In 
that 
case, 
given 
what 
we’ve 
seen 
about 
reference, 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
* 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
grass 
is 
green) 
has 
phi* 
is: 
Omni 
has 
phi. 
In 
particular, 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
(II) 
is 
simply: 
Omni=Omni, 
the 
same 
being 
true 
of 
(III). 
So 
if 
we 
treat 
definite 
descriptions 
as 
singular 
terms, 
and 
perspicuously 
state 
what 
is 
going 
on, 
we 
are 
left 
with 
this: 


(IR) 
grass 
is 
green. 
(IIR) 
Omni=Omni 
(IIIR) 
Omni=Omni 
(IVR) 
whales 
are 
mammals. 


But 
(I) 
and 
(IIR) 
aren’t 
logically 
equivalent, 
and 
Davidson’s 
argument 
fails. 


In 
another 
publication, 
Davidson 
uses 
a 
similar 
argument 
to 
show 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
fact. 
(On 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
supposed 
truth, 
Davidson 
advances 
some 
astonishing 
views 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
representation 
– 
he 
says 
there 
are 
no 
representations) 
Here 
is 
a 
reconstruction 
of 
his 
argument. 
Consider 
the 
following 
four 
expressions: 


(IF) 
"The 
fact 
that 
grass 
is 
green." 


(IIF) 
"The 
fact 
that 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
grass 
is 
green) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x)." 


(IIIF) 
"The 
fact 
that 
(x=x 
and 
whales 
are 
mammals) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x)." 


(IVF) 
"The 
fact 
that 
whales 
are 
mammals." 



(IF) 
and 
(IIF) 
must 
co-refer. 
For 
given 
(LL), 
"grass 
is 
green" 
must 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
"the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
grass 
is 
green) 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x)". 
So, 
given 
(CR), 
(IF) 
and 
(IIF) 
co-refer. 


(IIF) 
and 
(IIIF) 
co-refer 
for 
the 
same 
reason. 
And 
(IIIF) 
and 
(IVF) 
co-
refer 
for 
the 
same 
reason. 
So 
(IF) 
and 
(IVF) 
co-refer. 
Any 
two 
expression 
of 
the 
form 
"the 
fact 
that…" 
co-refer. 
There 
is 
only 
one 
fact. 


An 
exactly 
similar 
argument 
proves 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
true 
proposition. 
Simply 
replace 
each 
occurrence 
of 
"the 
fact 
that" 
in 
the 
foregoing 
argument. 
It 
is 
then 
established 
that 
"the 
proposition 
that 
grass 
is 
green" 
co-refers 
with 
""the 
proposition 
that 
whales 
are 
mammals", 
and 
with 
any 
other 
expression 
denoting 
a 
true 
proposition. 


Given 
what 
we’ve 
seen 
about 
reference, 
this 
argument 
of 
Davidson’s 
is 
simply 
fallacious. 
Suppose 
that, 
as 
Davidson’s 
argument 
requires, 
we 
treat 
definite 
descriptions 
as 
singular 
terms. 
In 
that 
case, 
for 
any 
property 
phi, 
*the 
class 
of 
all 
things 
x 
such 
that 
(x=x 
and 
grass 
is 
green) 
has 
phi* 
means 
simply: 
Omni 
has 
phi. 
So 
when 
we 
perspicuously 
re-write 
(IF)-(IVF), 
we 
are 
left 


with: 


(IF) 
The 
fact 
that 
grass 
is 
green. 
(IIF) 
The 
fact 
that 
Omni=Omni 
(IIIF) 
The 
fact 
that 
Omni=Omni. 
(IVF) 
The 
fact 
that 
whales 
are 
mammals. 


Since 
"Omni=Omni" 
is 
not 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
"grass 
is 
green" 
or 
with 
"whales 
are 
mammals", 
the 
first 
and 
last 
steps 
in 
the 
argument 
fail. 
Exactly 
similar 
considerations 
show 
the 
invalidity 
of 
the 
corresponding 
argument 
regarding 
propositions. 


A 
Quinean 
Slingshot 


Not 
too 
many 
people 
believe 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
fact 
or 
one 
proposition. 
Nobody 
believes 
that 
there 
is 
only 
one 
physical 
object. 


But 
many 
people 
believe, 
or 
used 
to 
believe, 
that 
modal 
operators, 



like 
"necessarily" 
and 
"possibly", 
are 
me 
falsity. 
This 
position 
is 
associated 
with 
h 


Russell[10] 
held 
that 
"necessarily 
superfluous. 
He 
said, 
first, 
that 
necessity 
propositions, 
but 
of 
propositional 
functio 
propositional 
function 
to 
be 
"necessarily 
values 
of 
its 
variables. 
Of 
course, 
he 
cou 
function 
is 
"necessary" 
if 
it 
is 
true 
for 
all 
would 
make 
his 
analysis 
circular, 
since 
" 
interdefinable. 


So 
Russell 
took 
the 
counter-intu 
propositional 
function 
to 
be 
necessary 
is 
of 
its 
variables. 
So, 
for 
Russell, 
what 
is 
e 
did 
not 
smoke 
a 
cigarette 
at 
t" 
is 
necessa 
of 
its 
variables. 
But 
this 
analysis 
of 
nece 
remotely 
to 
our 
modal 
judgments. 


A 
true 
proposition 
is 
vacuously 
variables. 
So 
Russell 
has 
said, 
in 
effect, 
necessary, 
and 
any 
two 
false 
ones 
are 
im 


Plainly, 
Russell 
has 
not 
analyze 
banished 
it 
from 
discourse. 


Quine 
used 
the 
Slingshot 
to 
rein 
modality. 
Quine 
had 
a 
special 
reason 
for 
were 
corrupt. 
In 
"Two 
Dogmas 
of 
Empir 
analytic 
sentences. 
In 
effect, 
he 
argued 
t 
propositions. 
Quine 
didn’t 
distinguish 
ep 
he 
thought 
that, 
if 
there 
was 
any 
necessit 
of 
"1+1=2"; 
he 
didn’t 
recognize 
the 
kind 
"water 
is 
H2O". 


So 
Quine 
needed 
there 
to 
be 
no 
propositions; 
for 
this 
thesis 
was 
a 
corner 
scientific 
explanation. 
He 
thought, 
presu 
independent 
corroboration 
for 
this 
thesis 


It 
is 
worth 
showing 
why 
Quine’ 
curb 
the 
modal 
nihilism, 
still 
alive 
today 


Some

Chapter 
10 
The 
causal 
theory 
of 
reference 


Suppose 
that, 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
"…E…", 
a 
sentence-token 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
has 
O 
as 
a 
constituent. 
In 
that 
case, 
let 
us 
say 
that 
occurrences 
of 
E 
"semantically 
contribute" 
(or, 
simply, 
"contribute"). 
I 
have 
repeatedly 
said 
that 


(SC) 
E 
refers 
to 
O 
iff 
E 
semantically 
contributes 
O. 


But 
(SC) 
is 
in 
apparent 
contradiction 
with 
a 
very 
popular 
theory: 
the 
so-called 
"causal 
theory" 
of 
reference. 
That 
theory 
is: 


(CTR) 
E 
refers 
to 
an 
object 
O 
iff 
tokens 
of 
E 
have 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
causal 
relation 
to 
O 
(or 
states 
of 
affairs 
involving 
O).[68] 


I 
would 
suggest 
that 
(CTR) 
is 
not 
in 
fact 
opposed 
to 
(SC), 
at 
least 
not 
in 
so 
far 
as 
(CTR) 
is 
a 
coherent 
doctrine. 


Some 
clarifications 
about 
CTR 
are 
appropriate. 
First 
of 
all, 
CTR 
is 
about 
expression-tokens. 
The 
expression-type 
"Socrates" 
isn’t 
causally 
connected 
to 
anything. 
Tokens 
of 
it 
have 
causal 
relations. 
CTR 
says 
that 
such 
tokens 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
just 
in 
case 
they 
have 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
causal 
relation 
to 
that 
man. 


There 
are 
other, 
less 
innocuous, 
qualifications. 
No 
one 
would 
maintain 
that 
(CTR) 
is 
meant 
to 
apply 
to 
all 
referring 
terms. 
Consider 
"the 
first 
animal 
born 
in 
the 
year 
3000 
A.D." 
(If 
you 
think 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
quantifiers, 
then 
consider: 
"ze 
first 
animal 
born 
in 
the 
year 
3000 
A.D.") 


Suppose 
that 
Alphie 
is 
the 
animal 
satisfying 
that 
description. 
In 
that 
case, 
Alphie 
is 
the 
thing 
referred 
to 
by 
that 
expression. 
But 
"the 
first 
animal 
born 
in 
the 
year 
3000 
A.D." 
refers 
to 
Alphie 
by 
virtue 
of 
encoding 
descriptive 
information 
that 
singles 
out 
Alphie; 
that 
expression 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
him 
by 
virtue 
of 
there 
being 
some 
causal 
relation 
between 
tokens 
of 
it 
and 
states 
of 
affairs 
involving 
Alphie. 
Such 
a 
causal 
connection 
doesn’t 
exist. 
Even 
if 
it 
did, 
it 
wouldn’t 
be 
what 
is 
operative. 



This 
point 
can 
be 
generalized. 
(CTR) 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
apply 
to 
any 
expression 
that 
has 
constituent 
structure. 
"That 
snow 
is 
white" 
refers 
to 
the 
proposition 
that 
snow 
is 
white. 
The 
former 
refers 
to 
the 
latter 
because 
the 
latter 
is 
the 
thing 
having 
the 
properties 
in 
the 
descriptive 
content 
encoded 
in 
the 
former. 
CTR 
may 
be 
meant 
to 
apply 
to 
the 
constituents 
of 
"that 
snow 
is 
white", 
but 
not 
to 
that 
expression 
as 
a 
whole. 


So 
far 
we’ve 
spoken 
about 
what 
CTR 
does 
not 
say. 
To 
explain 
what 
CTR 
does 
say, 
we 
need 
to 
define 
a 
few 
terms. 


Let 
R 
be 
a 
referring 
term 
belonging 
to 
some 
language 
L. 
R 
is 
"rigid" 
iff 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
every 
world 
where 
L 
is 
spoken. 
In 
every 
world 
where 
English 
is 
spoken, 
"Richard 
Nixon" 
refers 
to 
Richard 
Nixon.[69] 


Of 
course, 
there 
might 
be 
a 
world 
where 
"Richard 
Nixon" 
refers 
to 
John 
Kerry, 
but 
where 
otherwise 
English 
is 
spoken 
just 
as 
it 
is 
here. 
But, 
strictly 
speaking, 
the 
language 
spoken 
there 
isn’t 
quite 
identical 
with 
the 
language 
spoken 
here; 
that 
version 
of 
English 
comprises 
the 
rule: 


"Richard 
Nixon" 
refers 
to 
John 
Kerry. 


Our 
version 
of 
English 
does 
not 
comprise 
that 
rule. 
So 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
different 
sets 
of 
semantic 
rules, 
with 
different 
languages. 


When 
we 
talk 
about 
rigid 
designation, 
we 
always 
have 
in 
mind 
worlds 
where 
the 
language 
in 
question 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
exact 
same 
semantic 
rules 
that 
characterize 
it 
here. 


There 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
rigid 
designators. 
"Richard 
Nixon" 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
all 
worlds 
where 
English 
is 
spoken. 
This 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
its 
semantics. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
that 
expression 
is: 


(RN) 
"Richard 
Nixon" 
refers 
to 
O 
exactly 
if 
O 
is 
identical 
with 
Richard 
Nixon. 


"Richard 
Nixon" 
is 
what 
we 
call 
a 
de 
jure 
rigid 
designator.[70] 
Given 
only 
its 
semantics, 
"Richard 
Nixon" 
must 
refer 
to 
Richard 
Nixon. 
Nothing 
non-semantic 
– 
not 
even 
facts 
about 
mathematics 
or 
logic 
– 
are 
needed 
to 
secure 
that 
connection. 


"The 
square 
of 
two" 
is 
a 
rigid 
designator: 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
same 
thing 



in 
every 
world 
where 
English 
is 
spoken. 
But 
the 
semantics 
of 
that 
expression 
leave 
it 
open 
what 
it 
refers 
to 
in 
a 
different 
world. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
that 
expression 
is: 


(s) 
"the 
square 
of 
two" 
refers 
to 
a 
number 
n 
exactly 
if 
n 
is 
what 
results 
when 
two 
is 
squared. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
is 
not: 


(s*) 
"the 
square 
of 
two" 
refers 
to 
four. 


In 
a 
world 
where 
English 
is 
spoken, 
but 
where 
the 
square 
of 
two 
is 
five, 
"the 
square 
of 
two" 
refers 
to 
five. 


Granted, 
there 
probably 
is 
no 
such 
world. 
So 
"the 
square 
of 
two" 
refers 
to 
four 
in 
every 
world 
where 
English 
is 
spoken. 
But 
that 
is 
a 
fact 
about 
mathematics: 
the 
semantics 
involved 
leaves 
it 
open 
whether 
"the 
square 
of 
two" 
refers 
to 
five 
or 
not. 


"The 
square 
of 
two" 
is 
a 
de 
facto 
rigid 
designator. 
It 
does 
denote 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
all 
worlds 
where 
English 
is 
spoken. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
non-semantic 
facts; 
by 
themselves, 
the 
semantics 
of 
that 
expression 
do 
not 
guarantee 
that 
it 
will 
refer 
to 
four. 


"Four" 
is 
a 
de 
jure 
rigid 
designator. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
it 
is: 


(FR) 
"Four" 
refers 
to 
O 
exactly 
if 
O 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
number 
four. 


So 
no 
matter 
what 
laws 
of 
arithmetic 
obtain 
in 
a 
world 
w, 
"four" 
refers 
to 
four 
in 
that 
world, 
so 
long 
as 
English 
is 
spoken 
there; 
by 
themselves, 
the 
semantics 
of 
that 
expression 
guarantee 
that 
it 
refers 
to 
four. 


(CTR) 
is 
meant, 
presumably, 
to 
apply 
to 
de 
jure 
rigid 
designators, 
like 
"Nixon" 
and 
"Socrates". 
It 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
apply 
to 
de 
facto 
rigid 
designators 
like 
"the 
number 
of 
primes 
between 
10 
and 
20". 
De 
facto 
rigid 
designators 
refer 
by 
virtue 
of 
encoding 
the 
right 
descriptive 
information, 
never 
merely 
by 
virtue 
of 
a 
causal 
connection. 


Even 
with 
all 
of 
these 
restrictions, 
problems 
arise 
for 
(CTR). 
That 
doctrine 
has 
a 
hard 
time 
dealing 
with 
expressions 
that 
are 
de 
jure 
rigid 
designators, 
such 
as 
"2" 
and 
"justice". 
These 
terms 
denote 
abstract 
objects. 



Nothing 
has 
any 
causal 
connection 
to 
such 
an 
object. 
So 
it 
isn’t 
clear 
how 
CTR 
can 
deal 
with 
such 
terms. 


I 
myself 
think 
that 
the 
causal 
theory 
is 
wrong 
even 
for 
"Nixon" 
and 
"Socrates". 
But 
this 
is 
neither 
here 
nor 
there. 
What 
I 
wish 
to 
show 
now 
is 
that 
even 
if 
(CTR) 
is 
unrestrictedly 
true, 
there 
is 
still 
no 
opposition 
between 
it 
and 
(SC). 
There 
is 
no 
more 
opposition 
between 
those 
two 
views 
than 
there 
is 
between 
the 
view 
that 
a 
triangle 
is 
a 
closed, 
three-sided, 
planar, 
straight-
edged 
figure 
and 
the 
view 
that 
a 
triangle 
is 
the 
area 
bounded 
by 
three 
coplanar 
lines 
such 
that 
any 
two 
of 
them 
intersect, 
but 
not 
all 
three 
of 
them 
intersect. 


The 
right 
causal 
relation 


The 
causal 
theorist 
must 
say 
which 
causal 
relations 
constitute, 
or 
underwrite, 
reference. 
Not 
just 
any 
causal 
relation 
will 
do. 
If 
I 
push 
the 
doorbell, 
that 
causes 
the 
bell 
to 
ring. 
But 
the 
ringing 
of 
the 
bell 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
my 
pushing 
of 
the 
button. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
suppose 
that 
(CTR) 
is 
correct. 
Let 
R 
be 
the 
causal 
relation, 
whatsoever 
it 
should 
turn 
out 
to 
be, 
that 
constitutes 
or 
underwrites 
the 
relation 
of 
reference. 
In 
other 
words, 
R 
is 
the 
causal 
connection 
that 
causal 
theorists 
have 
in 
mind 
(or, 
better, 
that 
they 
are 
seeking). 


How 
do 
we 
know 
whether 
a 
given 
type 
of 
causal 
connection 
is 
the 
right 
one? 
What 
is 
our 
benchmark? 
Suppose 
some 
not 
very 
intelligent 
causal 
theorist 
says: 


(*) 
Consider 
the 
causal 
relation 
that 
holds 
between 
pushing 
the 
button 
at 
t 
and 
the 
bell’s 
ringing 
at 
t*. 
Let 
us 
refer 
to 
that 
relation 
as 
DB. 
R 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
causal 
relation 
that 
holds 
between 
Socrates 
(or, 
more 
exactly, 
states 
of 
affairs 
involving 
him) 
and 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
– 
it 
is 
the 
relation 
that 
makes 
those 
tokens 
refer 
to 
that 
person. 


Everyone 
would 
reject 
(*). 
DB 
obviously 
does 
not 
do 
the 
job. 
If 
indeed 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
stood 
in 
that 
relation 
to 
Socrates 
himself, 
that 
would 
not 
be 
enough 
for 
such 
tokens 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
man. 
Why 
not? 



If 
you 
want 
to 
make 
a 
statement 
about 
some 
pushing 
of 
some 
button, 
you 
cannot 
use 
the 
resulting 
bell-ringing 
as 
a 
way 
of 
doing 
so. 
Suppose 
that 
the 
button 
is 
pushed 
at 
t, 
and 
the 
bell 
rings 
at 
t*. 
Let 
RING 
be 
that 
particular 
ringing, 
and 
let 
PUSH 
be 
the 
button-pushing 
in 
question. 
The 
sound-token: 


(#) 
"[RING] 
[71] 
woke 
the 
dog." 


does 
not 
bear 
the 
proposition: 


(##) 
PUSH 
woke 
the 
dog. 


(#) 
doesn’t 
say 
anything. 
You 
have 
an 
unmeaning 
noise, 
followed 
by 
"is 
a 
distal 
cause 
of 
the 
dog’s 
waking 
up". 
So 
(#) 
no 
more 
bears 
(##), 
or 
any 
other 
proposition, 
than 
does: 


(###) 
"posidhfoasfhi 
woke 
the 
dog." 


What 
RING 
is 
missing 
is 
the 
ability 
to 
play 
a 
role 
in 
sentences.[72] 
RING 
cannot 
be 
a 
part 
of 
a 
well-formed 
English 
sentence. 
That 
fact, 
by 
itself, 
bars 
us 
from 
saying 
that 
RING 
refers 
to 
anything, 
at 
least 
in 
English. 
In 
order 
to 
qualify 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
English 
that 
refers 
to 
PUSH, 
RING 
must 
be 
able 
to 
figure 
grammatically 
in 
English 
sentences. 
It 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
say 
that 
a 
referring 
term 
belonging 
to 
English 
could 
not 
be 
used 
grammatically 
in 
English 
sentences. 


An 
expression 
can 
be 
used 
grammatically 
in 
a 
sentence 
of 
English 
only 
if 
it 
can 
make 
a 
semantically 
significant 
contribution 
to 
such 
a 
sentence. 
So 
if 
it 
is 
to 
refer 
to 
RING, 
PUSH 
must 
be 
able 
to 
make 
such 
a 
contribution. 


But 
that 
is 
not 
enough. 
The 
word 
"Morgan 
Freeman" 
makes 
semantically 
significant 
contributions 
to 
English 
sentences. 
But 
"Morgan 
Freeman" 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
PUSH. 


If 
RING 
is 
to 
refer 
to 
PUSH, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
that 
it 
make 
just 
any 
semantic 
contribution; 
it 
must 
contribute 
some 
specific 
thing. 
The 
thing 
it 
contributes 
must 
presumably 
be 
PUSH 
itself. 


DB 
is 
the 
wrong 
causal 
relation 
because 
it 
does 
not 
enable 
RING 
to 
contribute 
PUSH 
to 
the 
meanings 
of 
sentences. 


The 
other 
side 
of 
the 
coin 
is 
that, 
if 
DB 
did 
enable 
RING 
to 



contribute 
PUSH 
to 
the 
meanings 
of 
sentences, 
then 
DB 
would 
be 
the 
right 
causal 
relation. 


No 
causal 
theorist 
holds 
that 
any 
causal 
relation 
is 
reference-
constituting. 
How 
does 
he 
decide 
which 
causal 
relation 
is 
the 
right 
one? 
The 
decision 
is 
based 
on 
considerations 
like 
the 
ones 
mentioned. 
Suppose 
x 
stands 
in 
causal 
relation 
R 
to 
y. 
If 
that 
is 
necessary 
and 
sufficient 
for 
x’s 
semantically 
contributing 
y, 
then 
R 
is 
the 
right 
relation. 
If 
not, 
not. 
So 
R 
is 
the 
right 
causal 
relation 
exactly 
if 
it 
is 
consistent 
with 
SC. 


A 
qualification 


RING 
could 
refer 
to 
PUSH. 
Indeed, 
RING 
could 
refer 
to 
PUSH 
in 
virtue 
of 
standing 
in 
a 
certain 
causal 
relation 
to 
PUSH. 
But 
that 
would 
not 
be 
enough 
to 
make 
the 
causal 
theory 
be 
correct. 


Let 
L 
be 
a 
language 
that 
is 
just 
like 
English 
except 
that, 
by 
our 
stipulation, 
L 
is 
characterized 
by 
the 
following 
semantic 
rule. 
In 
L, 
the 
ringing 
produced 
by 
a 
door-bell 
pushing 
actually 
refers 
to 
that 
doorbell 
pushing. 
Let 
RING* 
be 
some 
particular 
door-bell 
ringing. 
In 
L, 
the 
spoken 
sentence-token 
"[RING*][73] 
woke 
the 
dog" 
means 
that 
a 
certain 
door-bell 
pushing 
woke 
the 
dog. 
[74] 


Here 
we 
have 
a 
clear 
case 
where 
one 
thing 
refers 
to 
another 
in 
virtue 
of 
there 
being 
a 
causal 
connection 
between 
the 
two. 


But 
notice 
that, 
by 
itself, 
the 
causal 
relation 
does 
not 
suffice 
for 
the 
reference 
relation. 
What 
suffices 
is 
that 
causal 
relation 
plus 
some 
semantic 
rule 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
if 
x 
and 
y 
stand 
in 
that 
causal 
relation, 
then 
sentences 
of 
the 
form 
"…x…" 
are 
to 
mean:…y… 


The 
content 
of 
the 
causal 
theory 


This 
last 
point 
gives 
us 
some 
insight 
into 
what 
can 
legitimately 
be 
alleged 
by 
a 
causal 
theory 
of 
reference. 
This 
insight 
will, 
in 
turn, 
substantiate 
our 
analysis 
of 
reference. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
suppose 
that 
the 
causal 
theorist 
is 
right; 
suppose 
there 
is 
some 
causal 
relation 
R 
such 
that 
x 
(a 
given 
sound 
or 
inscription) 
refers 
to 
y 
iff 
y 
stands 
in 
R 
to 
x. 


In 
that 
case, 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
because 
Socrates 



stands 
in 
relation 
R 
to 
those 
tokens. 
But 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
show 
a 
causal 
relation 
is 
never 
sufficient 
for 
reference. 
And 
when 
we 
make 
it 
clear 
what 
is 
sufficient, 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
a 
causal 
connection 
between 
object 
and 
token 
has 
a 
decidedly 
subordinate 
role. 
Obviously 
there 
is 
an 
Albanian 
word 
for 
Socrates, 
a 
Finnish 
word 
for 
Socrates, 
an 
Urdu 
word 
for 
Socrates, 
and 
so 
on. 
These 
are 
different 
words. 
According 
to 
the 
causal 
theorist, 
for 
any 
token 
t 
of 
any 
one 
of 
these 
words, 
what 
makes 
t 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
is 
that 
Socrates 
stands 
in 
R 
to 
t. 
The 
Urdu 
word 
for 
Socrates 
is 
"Sukrat". 
So 
according 
to 
the 
causal 
theorist, 
tokens 
of 
"Sukrat" 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
because 
Socrates 
stands 
in 
R 
to 
"Sukrat". 
The 
same 
is 
true 
mutatis 
mutandis 
of 
the 
Albanian 
word 
for 
Socrates, 
the 
Finnish 
word, 
the 
Hungarian 
word, 
and 
so 
on. 


Let 
us 
focus 
on 
"Sukrat." 
If 
you 
were 
to 
put 
"Sukrat" 
in 
an 
English 
sentence 
(I 
mean, 
if 
you 
were 
to 
use 
N 
in 
an 
English 
sentence, 
not 
mention 
it), 
the 
result 
would 
be 
ungrammatical; 
you 
would 
not 
have 
a 
well-formed 
sentence 
of 
English. 
If 
you 
were 
to 
say 
"Sukrat 
was 
wise" 
or 
"Sukrat 
drank 
hemlock", 
the 
result 
would 
not 
be 
a 
well-formed 
sentence. 
People 
might 
understand 
you 
– 
after 
all, 
communication 
doesn’t 
always 
involve 
well-
formed 
utterances. 
(If 
I 
child 
emits 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
cry, 
I 
know 
that 
it 
wants 
food 
or 
wants 
its 
diaper 
to 
be 
changed. 
But 
its 
cry 
is 
not 
English 
or 
Urdu 
or 
any 
other 
language.) 
When 
you 
said 
"Sukrat 
was 
wise", 
they 
might 
say: 
"You 
mean 
Socrates 
was 
wise! 
I 
didn’t 
understand 
you 
at 
first." 
Their 
understanding 
you 
would 
involve 
their 
doing 
a 
bit 
of 
translation. 
This 
means 
that 
your 
utterance 
was 
not 
a 
well-formed 
utterance 
of 
English; 
it 
contained 
a 
renegade 
constituent, 
one 
that 
had 
to 
be 
replaced 
with 
an 
English 
word 
to 
yield 
proper 
English. 


This 
point 
is 
liable 
to 
be 
misunderstood; 
maybe 
a 
different 
example 
would 
help. 
The 
Spanish 
word 
for 
"wet" 
is 
"mojado". 
According 
to 
the 
causal 
theorist, 
tokens 
of 
"mojado" 
refers 
to 
the 
property 
of 
wetness 
exactly 
because 
they 
stand 
in 
a 
certain 
causal 
relation 
to 
instances 
of 
wetness. 
If 
you 
were 
to 
say 
"Smith 
is 
mojado", 
what 
you 
were 
saying 
would 
be 
patently 
ungrammatical. 
The 
same 
thing 
is 
true 
of 
"Sukrat", 
though 
perhaps 
less 
obviously. 
If 
you 
said 
"Sukrat 
was 
wise", 
what 
you 
were 
saying 
would 
be 
ungrammatical. 
If 
you 
resist 
this, 
then 
(mutatis 
mutandis) 
simply 
replace 
"Sukrat" 
with 
"mojado" 
in 
the 
present 
discussion. 


Of 
course, 
what 
is 
ungrammatical 
today 
might 
be 
grammatical 
tomorrow. 
Languages 
are 
plastic 
entities, 
at 
least 
along 
certain 
dimensions. 
Lexical 
items 
can 
be 
added 
quite 
freely. 
(Non-lexical 
changes 
– 
changes 
in 



syntax 
or 
grammar 
– 
are 
less 
easily 
made 
and 
are 
virtually 
never 
made 
intentionally.) 
So 
if 
you 
had 
a 
friend 
who 
always 
said 
"Sukrat" 
instead 
of 
Socrates, 
you 
would, 
in 
effect, 
add 
a 
rule 
to 
your 
idiolect 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
"Sukrat" 
refers 
to 
Socrates. 
But 
until 
such 
a 
rule 
were 
added 
to 
English 
– 
and, 
as 
of 
yet, 
it 
hasn’t 
been 
added 
– 
"Sukrat" 
is 
not 
in 
the 
English 
lexicon; 
it 
is 
not 
given 
a 
meaning 
by 
the 
semantics 
of 
English; 
therefore 
"Sukrat 
was 
wise", 
though 
perhaps 
easily 
enough 
understood, 
is 
not 
well-formed; 
it 
is 
not 
grammatical. 


Given 
any 
referring 
term, 
it 
will 
be 
a 
referring 
term 
of 
this 
or 
that 
language. 
It 
will 
not 
be 
a 
referring 
term 
simpliciter. 
"Sukrat" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
in 
Urdu, 
not 
in 
English. 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
in 
English, 
not 
in 
Urdu. 


If 
the 
causal 
theory 
is 
right, 
then 
what 
makes 
tokens 
of 
"Sukrat" 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
is 
wholly 
that 
Socrates 
stands 
in 
relation 
R 
to 
those 
tokens. 
After 
all, 
the 
causal 
theorist 
says 
that 
x 
refers 
to 
y 
iff 
y 
stands 
in 
relation 
R 
to 


x. 
Tokens 
of 
"Sukrat" 
stand 
in 
relation 
R 
to 
Socrates. 
Therefore 
such 
tokens 
refer 
to 
Socrates. 
But 
in 
English 
"Sukrat" 
obviously 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
Socrates. 
Quite 
possibly, 
in 
any 
language 
other 
than 
Urdu, 
"Sukrat" 
does 
not 
refer 
to 
Socrates. 


But 
the 
causal 
theorist 
says 
that 
what 
makes 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
is 
simply 
that 
the 
latter 
stands 
in 
R 
to 
the 
former; 
the 
reference-
relation 
in 
question 
is 
constituted 
by 
that 
causal 
relation. 
That 
causal 
relation 
is 
quite 
enough, 
according 
to 
the 
causal 
theorist, 
for 
"Socrates" 
to 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
in 
English. 
But 
the 
problem 
is 
that 
tokens 
of 
"Sukrat" 
stand 
in 
that 
relation 
to 
Socrates 
no 
less 
than 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates". 
And 
yet 
tokens 
of 
"Sukrat" 
clearly 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
in 
English. 
So 
for 
x 
to 
refer 
to 
y 
in 
some 
language 
L, 
it 
is 
not 
enough 
that 
y 
stand 
in 
R 
to 
x. 
That 
may 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
story; 
but 
it 
cannot 
be 
the 
whole 
of 
it. 


The 
causal 
theorist 
might 
resist 
this, 
and 
say: 


The 
causal 
relation 
that 
an 
Urdu 
word 
must 
bear 
to 
Socrates, 
if 
that 
word 
is 
to 
refer 
to 
him, 
is 
different 
from 
the 
causal 
relation 
that 
an 
English 
word 
must 
bear 
to 
Socrates, 
if 
that 
word 
is 
to 
refer 
to 
him. 
Both 
of 
those 
relations 
are 
different 
from 
the 
causal 
relation 
that 
a 
Tagalog 
word 
must 
be 
to 
Socrates, 
if 
that 
word 
is 
to 
refer 
to 
Socrates. 
Different 
causal 
relations 
are 
involved 
in 
different 
languages. 



This 
position 
disjunctivizes 
the 
concept 
of 
reference. 
There 
is 
referenceinUrdu, 
referenceinEnglish, 
referenceinFrench, 
and 
so 
on.[75] 
But 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
single 
concept 
of 
reference. 
This 
is 
plainly 
unacceptable. 
"Sukrat" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
in 
the 
very 
sense 
in 
which 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
him, 
and 
in 
which 
the 
Chinese 
word 
for 
Socrates 
refers 
to 
him. 


To 
avoid 
disjunctivizing 
the 
concept 
of 
reference, 
the 
causal 
theorist 
must 
say 
that 
some 
one 
relation 
R 
does 
the 
job. 
But 
we 
have 
already 
seen 
why 
such 
a 
position 
is 
untenable. 


At 
this 
point, 
the 
causal 
theorist 
may 
weaken 
his 
position 
and 
say: 


I 
never 
said 
that 
reference 
is 
some 
causal 
relation; 
I 
said 
that 
a 
certain 
causal 
relation 
is 
essentially 
involved 
in 
reference. 
So 
reference 
per 
se 
is 
not 
some 
causal 
relation; 
it 
is 
something 
else. 
That 
something 
else 
involves 
some 
kind 
of 
causal 
relation. 


But 
then 
we 
are 
left 
with 
no 
answer 
to 
the 
question: 
"what 
is 
reference?" 
Yet 
this 
is 
the 
very 
question 
that 
CTR 
is 
supposed 
to 
answer. 


A 
place 
for 
CTR 


Still, 
there 
is 
a 
certain 
truth 
in 
CTR. 
Consider 
the 
English 
semantic 
rule 
that 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
Socrates. 
That 
rule 
may 
well 
exploit 
some 
causal 
connection 
obtaining 
between 
certain 
current 
sound-and 
inscription-tokenings, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
states 
of 
affairs 
involving 
Socrates, 
on 
the 
other. 
That 
rule 
may 
be 
at 
least 
vaguely 
like: 


(CRS) 
Let 
s 
be 
an 
arbitrary 
token 
of 
the 
physical 
type 
"Socrates". 
If 
there 
is 
some 
object 
x 
such 
that 
x 
uniquely 
stands 
in 
causal 
relation 
R 
[for 
the 
appropriate 
value 
of 
R] 
with 
respect 
to 
s, 
then 
s 
refers 
to 
x. 
If 
there 
is 
no 
such 
object, 
then 
s 
refers 
to 
nothing. 
If 
there 
are 
many 
such 
objects, 
then 
s 
is 
ambiguous 
between 
them. 


So 
given 
(CRS), 
and 
given 
that 
Socrates 
is 
the 
thing 
to 
which 
my 
token 
of 
"Socrates" 
stands 
in 
relation 
R, 
it 
follows 
that 
Socrates 
is 
what 
that 
token 
refers 
to. 
If 
Plato 
were 
the 
thing 
to 
which 
that 
tokening 
stood 
in 
that 
relation, 
then 
that 
tokening 
would 
refer 
to 
Plato. 



In 
general, 
causal 
connections 
are 
involved 
in 
reference 
only 
when 
semantic 
rules 
exploit 
them. 


This 
insight 
enables 
us 
to 
circumvent 
some 
problems 
associated 
with 
CTR. 
We 
can 
obviously 
refer 
to 
things 
to 
which 
we 
have 
no 
causal 
connection 
– 
for 
example, 
future 
individuals 
and 
abstract 
objects. 


But 
there 
is 
only 
one 
concept 
of 
reference. 
"2" 
refers 
to 
the 
number 
two 
in 
exactly 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
"Nixon" 
refers 
to 
Nixon. 
There 
is 
no 
causal 
connection 
between 
the 
first 
pair. 
So 
CTR 
disjunctivizes 
the 
concept 
of 
reference. 


Here 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
a 
different 
disjunctivization 
of 
reference 
from 
the 
one 
discussed 
before. 
So 
CTR 
is 
guilty 
of 
doubly 
disjunctivizing 
an 
obviously 
unified 
concept. 
Thus 
CTR, 
if 
taken 
as 
a 
thesis 
as 
to 
what 
constitutes 
reference, 
is 
doubly 
wrong. 


Advocates 
of 
CTR 
have 
tried 
to 
work 
around 
this 
problem, 
saying 
things 
like: 
Tokens 
of 
"2" 
are 
causally 
connected 
to 
instances 
of 
the 
number 
two; 
and 
that 
is 
why 
such 
tokens 
refer 
to 
that 
number.[76] 


But 
such 
maneuvers 
are 
obviously 
implausible. 
One 
can 
refer 
to 
the 
number 
two 
itself, 
not 
just 
to 
instances 
of 
the 
entity; 
and 
we 
have 
no 
causal 
connections 
to 
that 
entity 
itself. 


Further, 
causal 
connections 
aren’t 
fine-grained 
enough 
to 
constitute-
reference: 
I 
can 
refer 
to 
the 
clay, 
the 
statue, 
time-slices 
of 
the 
statue. 
I 
am 
referring 
to 
a 
different 
thing 
in 
each 
case. 
But 
any 
causal 
connection 
I 
have 
to 
the 
one 
is 
equally 
a 
causal 
connection 
to 
the 
others.[77] 


Even 
if 
these 
problems 
can 
be 
finessed, 
CTR 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
true 
of 
referring 
terms 
that 
have 
phrasal 
structure, 
like 
"that 
Socrates 
wept 
often" 
and 
"the 
[ze] 
center 
of 
mass 
of 
the 
galaxy". 
Such 
terms 
refer 
by 
virtue 
of 
describing, 
not 
by 
virtue 
of 
a 
casual 
connection. 
If 
CTR 
says 
that 
causal 
connections 
constitute 
reference, 
instead 
of 
being 
merely 
involved, 
then 
it 
says 
that 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
"Nixon" 
refers 
to 
Nixon 
is 
entirely 
different 
from 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
"the 
phi" 
(or 
"ze 
phi") 
refers 
to 
the 
phi. 


These 
problems 
vanish 
when 
CTR 
is 
put 
in 
its 
proper 
context. 


In 
some 
cases, 
we 
define 
a 
word 
by 
pointing 
to 
its 
referent: 
"that 
man 
over 
there 
is 
Thaddeus 
Smith." 
Reference 
is 
secured 
through 
ostension. 


This 
is 
not 
always 
how 
words 
are 
defined. 
When 
we 
leave 
aside 
ostensive 
definition, 
we 
find 
that 
reference 
is 
always 
secured 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
We 
describe 
the 
thing 
to 
which 
an 
expression 
is 
meant 
to 
apply. 
But 
we 
give 
the 
description 
wide-scope. 
That 
way 
the 
sole 
semantic 
content 
of 
the 



expression 
is 
the 
individual: 
the 
expression 
doesn’t 
become 
a 
Russellian 
description-quantifier. 


Suppose 
I 
want 
to 
produce 
a 
term 
that 
refers 
to 
the 
first 
individual 
born 
in 
the 
3rd 
millennium. 
I 
say: 


(3M) 
If 
there 
is 
some 
object 
O 
such 
that 
O 
is 
the 
first 
individual 
born 
in 
the 
3rd 
Millennium, 
then 
"Simon" 
refers 
to 
O. 


Because 
the 
descriptive 
content 
in 
that 
rule 
is 
given 
wide-scope 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
"refers 
to" 
operator, 
the 
statement 
"There 
are 
possible 
worlds 
where 
Simon 
is 
born 
in 
the 
2nd 
millennium" 
is 
true. 
This 
is 
what 
we 
want: 
after 
all, 
any 
individual 
could 
have 
had 
a 
slightly 
different 
birth-date. 


As 
we’ve 
seen, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
CTR 
has 
any 
chance 
of 
being 
right, 
it 
is 
because 
certain 
semantic 
rules 
exploit 
causal 
connections. 
If 
a 
causal 
connection 
between 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
and 
Socrates 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
former 
refer 
to 
the 
latter, 
it 
is 
because 
some 
rule 
like 
the 
following 
exists: 


(S) 
If 
there 
is 
some 
individual 
O 
such 
that 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
stand 
in 
R 
to 
O, 
then 
those 
tokens 
refer 
to 
O. 
(S) 
and 
(3M) 
are 
completely 
parallel. 
In 
both 
cases, 
reference 
is 
secured 
through 
descriptive 
information. 
But 
that 
information 
is 
given 
wide-
scope 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
"refers 
to" 
operator. 
Where 
(S) 
is 
concerned, 
the 
descriptive 
content 
has 
to 
do 
with 
causal 
relations; 
where 
(3M) 
is 
concerned, 
this 
is 
not 
so. 
But 
that 
doesn’t 
have 
any 
special 
ramifications. 
Descriptions 
differ; 
some 
involve 
the 
concept 
of 
causality; 
some 
don’t. 
Some 
involve 
the 
concept 
of 
wearing 
a 
feathered-hat; 
some 
don’t. 
I 
can 
describe 
an 
entity 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
causal 
liaisons 
or 
in 
terms 
of 
what 
kinds 
of 
clothes 
it 
is 
wearing. 
CTR 
merely 
registers 
the 
banal 
fact 
that, 
in 
some 
cases, 
the 
descriptive 
information 
in 
question 
has 
to 
do 
with 
a 
thing’s 
causal 
liaisons. 
Once 
this 
is 
realized, 
we 
don’t 
have 
to 
invent 
tortured 
hypotheses 
as 
to 
why 
there 
really 
is 
a 
causal 
connection 
between 
the 
number 
two 
and 
tokens 
of 
the 
expression 
"2". 
There 
is 
no 
such 
connection; 
such 
tokens 
are 
not 



causally 
connected 
to 
the 
platonic 
type 
two, 
but 
only 
to 
its 
instances. 
Even 
if 
there 
were 
such 
a 
causal 
connection, 
it 
wouldn’t 
be 
reference-constituting. 
What 
would 
be 
reference-constituting 
would 
be 
a 
semantic 
rule 
that 
fixed 
the 
referent 
of 
"2" 
in 
terms 
of 
descriptive 
information. 
That 
rule 
might 
exploit 
a 
description 
that 
alluded 
to 
the 
causal 
liaisons 
of 
certain 
things 
(although, 
in 
actuality, 
it 
would 
not). 
But 
that 
doesn’t 
warrant 
a 
causal 
theory 
of 
reference. 
If 
I 
say 
"Jim 
is 
the 
man 
wearing 
the 
feathered 
hat", 
I 
am 
exploiting 
the 
fact 
that 
Jim 
is 
wearing 
a 
certain 
hat. 
In 
effect, 
I 
am 
saying: 
"there 
is 
some 
contextually 
salient 
object 
O 
that 
is 
wearing 
a 
feathered 
hat: 
‘Jim’ 
refers 
to 
O." 
But 
this 
doesn’t 
warrant 
a 
feathered-hat 
theory 
of 
reference.[78] 
[79] 


A 
nicety 


Uncontroversially, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
"Sukrat" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
only 
in 
Urdu. 
We’ve 
seen 
how 
this 
fact 
causes 
trouble 
for 
the 
causal 
theory. 


In 
my 
view, 
it 
is 
analytic 
that 
"Sukrat" 
can 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
only 
in 
Urdu. 
Given 
any 
word 
w 
of 
any 
language 
L, 
it 
is 
analytic 
that 
w 
cannot 
be 
used 
grammatically 
in 
a 
sentence 
not 
belonging 
to 
L. 
A 
homonym 
of 
w 
can 
be 
so 
used, 
but 
not 
w 
itself. 
Perhaps 
a 
homonym 
of 
"Sukrat" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
in 
some 
language 
other 
than 
Urdu. 
In 
that 
case, 
that 
homonym 
can 
be 
used 
grammatically 
in 
some 
language 
other 
than 
Urdu. 
But 
the 
Urdu 
word 
"Sukrat" 
cannot 
refer 
to 
Socrates, 
or 
have 
any 
grammatically 
licensed 
role, 
in 
any 
language 
other 
than 
Urdu. 


Suppose 
the 
gases 
brewing 
in 
a 
volcano 
yield 
the 
noise 
"Socrates 
was 
wise". 
The 
volcano 
hasn’t 
really 
said 
anything. 
It 
produced 
sounds 
that 
would 
have 
meant 
something 
if 
we 
had 
produced 
them. 
When 
we 
say 
"Socrates 
was 
wise", 
it 
is 
in 
consequence 
of 
our 
following 
certain 
semantic 
rules. 
If 
we 
were 
following 
no 
such 
rules, 
then 
we 
wouldn’t 
be 
using 
a 
language 
at 
all; 
we 
wouldn’t 
be 
saying 
anything. 
By 
exactly 
similar 
reasoning, 
what 
makes 
a 
sound 
be 
a 
token 
of 
a 
word 
is 
that 
one 
produces 
that 
token 
in 
consequence 
of 
one’s 
following 
a 
certain 
semantic 
rule; 
if 
one 
is 
just 
caused 
to 
blurt 
it 
out 
– 
the 
way 
a 
corpse 
might 
be 
electrically 
stimulated 
to 
make 
noise 
– 
one 
wouldn’t 
really 
have 
produced 
a 
bit 
of 
language 
at 
all. 
Unless 
we 
have 
something 
that 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
one’s 
awareness 
of 
a 
semantic 
rule, 
we 
don’t 
have 
a 
word-token. 


A 
corollary 
is 
that 
which 
word 
you 
are 
tokening 
is 
not 
determined 
solely 
by 
the 
phonetic 
properties 
of 
your 
utterance. 
If 
you 
really 
produced 
a 



word-token, 
and 
not 
just 
a 
noise 
that 
sounds 
like 
a 
word-token, 
that 
means 
you 
were 
following 
a 
semantic 
rule, 
and 
that 
you 
produced 
that 
word-token 
as 
a 
consequence 
thereof. 
Which 
word 
you 
tokened 
is 
a 
function 
of 
which 
rule 
you 
were 
following. 


As 
we 
said 
before, 
a 
word 
never 
refers 
simpliciter; 
it 
always 
refers 
in 
this 
or 
that 
particular 
language. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Socrates" 
is 
not: 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
Socrates. 
It 
is: 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
in 
English. 


Suppose 
a 
speaker 
of 
L 
produced 
the 
sound 
"Sukrat" 
in 
consequence 
of 
following 
the 
semantic 
rule 
of 
L 
that 
assigns 
Socrates 
to 
"Sukrat". 
What 
he 
has 
tokened 
is 
a 
word 
of 
L, 
not 
of 
Urdu. 
He 
was 
not 
following 
an 
Urdu 
semantic 
rule, 
and 
thus 
didn’t 
token 
an 
Urdu 
word. 
So 
strictly 
speaking, 
his 
utterance 
was 
ungrammatical, 
even 
though 
that 
ungrammaticality 
is 
completely 
undetectable. 


§ 
Here 
is 
Frege’s 
position. 
Referring 
terms 
have 
both 
"sense" 
and 
"reference". 
The 
sense 
is 
a 
concept; 
the 
referent 
is 
the 
unique 
entity 
falling 
under 
that 
concept. 
Consider 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals". 
The 
sense 
is 
a 
concept 
--unique 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 
The 
referent 
is 
the 
entity 
satisfying 
that 
concept, 
namely 
Franklin. 
Now 
consider 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general". 
The 
referent 
is 
the 
same 
as 
before, 
but 
the 
sense 
is 
different. 
In 
this 
case 
the 
sense 
is 
the 
concept 
unique 
first 
post-master 
general. 


It 
is 
because 
of 
these 
differences 
in 
sense 
that 
the 
following 
two 
sentences 
convey 
very 
different 
propositions: 


(i) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored." 
(ii) 
"The 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored". 
In 
both 
cases, 
the 
same 
property 
is 
being 
attributed 
to 
the 
same 
person. 
But 
different 
senses 
or 
concepts 
are 
being 
used 
to 
pick 
out 
that 
person. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
information 
that 
(i) 
gives 
you 
is 
different 
from 
the 
information 
that 
(ii) 
gives 
you. 
In 
the 
one 
case 
you 
are 
learning 
that 
a 
unique 
bifocal 
inventor 
snored; 
in 
the 
other 
case, 
you 
are 
learning 
that 
a 
unique 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored. 
So 
what 
is 
learned 
in 
the 
one 
case 
is 
very 
different 
from 
what 
is 
learned 
in 
the 
other. 


There 
are 
obviously 
elements 
of 
deep 
truth 
in 
Frege’s 
position. 
But 



there 
are 
also 
deep 
muddles. 
To 
see 
the 
truth 
in 
Frege’s 
position, 
we 
must 
first 
identify 
the 
muddles. 


First, 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
the 
expression 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
or 
the 
sentence 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored". 
There 
are 
expression-types 
and 
expression-tokens. 
Type-meaning 
is 
different 
from 
token 
meaning. 
The 
meaning 
of 
an 
expression-type 
is 
a 
rule 
saying 
how 
to 
compute 
the 
meanings 
of 
the 
corresponding 
tokens. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
type 
corresponding 
to 
(i) 
is 
a 
rule 
saying 
which 
propositions 
are 
meant 
by 
tokens 
of 
that 
type. 
The 
meaning 
of 
one 
of 
those 
tokens 
is 
the 
proposition 
assigned 
it 
by 
that 
rule. 
The 
meaning 
of 
the 
type 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
rule 
saying 
what 
its 
tokens 
refer 
to. 
The 
meaning 
of 
a 
given 
token 
is 
the 
thing 
referred 
to. 


The 
rule 
that 
assigns 
propositions 
to 
tokens 
of 
(i) 
is 
very 
different 
from 
the 
rule 
that 
assigns 
propositions 
to 
tokens 
of 
(ii). 


In 
the 
first 
case, 
the 
rule 
is 
this. 
if 
somebody 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals, 
then 
tokens 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
are 
true 
exactly 
if 
x 
snored. 
Let 
R1 
be 
this 
rule. 


In 
the 
other 
case, 
the 
rule 
is 
this: 
if 
somebody 
x 
was 
a 
unique 
first 
post-master 
general, 
then 
tokens 
of 
"the 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored" 
are 
true 
exactly 
if 
x 
snored. 
Let 
R2 
be 
this 
rule. 


To 
understand 
an 
expression 
is 
to 
be 
able 
to 
assign 
it 
the 
right 
meaning. 
Doing 
this 
involves 
applying 
the 
relevant 
semantic 
rules. 


To 
understand 
a 
token 
of 
(i), 
one 
must 
apply 
R1. 
Inevitably, 
to 
anyone 
who 
understands 
such 
a 
token, 
it 
will 
communicate 
(inter 
alia) 
that 
somebody 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
bifocals 
and 
x 
snored. 


To 
understand 
a 
token 
of 
(ii), 
one 
must 
apply 
R2. 
Inevitably, 
to 
anyone 
who 
understands 
such 
a 
token, 
it 
will 
communicate 
(inter 
alia) 
that 
somebody 
x 
was 
a 
unique 
first 
post-master 
general, 
and 
x 
snored. 


So 
what 
a 
token 
of 
(i) 
communicates 
is 
different 
from 
what 
a 
token 
of 
(ii) 
communicates. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
because 
they 
encode 
different 
propositions. 
It 
is 
because 
the 
relevant 
semantic 
rules 
are 
different. 


R1 
gives 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
corresponding 
to 
(i), 
and 
R2 
gives 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
corresponding 
to 
(ii) 
.So 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
corresponding 
to 
(i) 
is 
different 
from 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
corresponding 
to 
(ii). 
This 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
point 
we 
made 
a 
moment 
ago: 
the 
rule 
that 
assigns 
meaning 
to 
tokens 
of 
the 
one 
type 
is 
different 
from 
the 
rule 
that 
assigns 
meaning 
to 
tokens 
of 
the 
other 
type. 



Thus, 
the 
differences 
in 
cognitive 
value 
between 
tokens 
of 
(i) 
and 
tokens 
of 
(ii) 
have 
to 
do 
with 
differences 
in 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
corresponding 
types. 
Those 
differences 
do 
not 
have 
to 
do 
with 
semantics 
of 
the 
tokens 
themselves. 


Where 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
concerned, 
what 
Frege 
calls 
"sense" 
is 
type-semantics, 
and 
what 
he 
calls 
"reference" 
is 
token-semantics. 
The 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
given 
by 
the 
rule: 
for 
any 
x, 
a 
token 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
refers 
to 
x 
exactly 
if 
x 
falls 
under 
the 
concept 
unique 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 
The 
semantics 
of 
such 
a 
token 
is 
the 
thing 
assigned 
it 
by 
the 
rule 
just 
given 
– 
it 
is 
the 
referent 
of 
that 
token. 


It 
is 
expression-tokens 
that 
refer. 
Expression-types 
assign 
referents 
to 
their 
tokens, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
themselves 
refer. 
In 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi*, 
a 
sentence-token 
encodes 
the 
proposition 
Franklin 
has 
phi. 
The 
occurrence 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
obviously 
associated 
with 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 
But 
that 
association 
lies 
in 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
corresponding 
type. 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
that 
type 
is: 
any 
token 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
refers 
to 
x 
exactly 
if 
x 
uniquely 
satisfies 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 


Frege 
thought 
that, 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi*, 
a 
sentence-token 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
there 
is 
a 
unique 
bifocal 
inventor 
x, 
and 
x 
has 
phi. 
This 
view 
is 
a 
mistake. 
The 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
does 
not 
make 
it 
into 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
tokens 
of 
*the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
has 
phi*. 
That 
concept 
is 
part 
of 
the 
rule 
that 
picks 
out 
a 
thing 
which 
is 
to 
be 
a 
constituent 
of 
that 
proposition. 
But 
that 
concept 
is 
not 
itself 
such 
a 
constituent. 
As 
we 
saw 
earlier, 
if 
that 
concept 
were 
such 
a 
constituent, 
then 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
would 
be 
a 
quantifier, 
not 
a 
singular 
term. 


But, 
as 
we’ve 
seen, 
even 
though 
that 
concept 
is 
not 
itself 
such 
a 
constituent, 
its 
presence 
in 
the 
relevant 
type-semantic 
rule 
is 
enough 
to 
ensure 
that 
such 
a 
token 
will 
communicate 
the 
proposition: 
exactly 
one 
thing 
x 
invented 
bifocals, 
and 
x 
has 
phi. 


The 
distinction 
between 
sense 
and 
reference 
is 
obviously 
legitimate, 
and 
it 
obviously 
does 
the 
job 
that 
Frege 
wanted 
it 
to 
do: 
it 
accounts 
for 
the 
differences 
in 
cognitive 
value 
between 
utterances 
of 
(i) 
and 
utterances 
of 
(ii). 
What 
Frege 
didn’t 
realize 
is 
that 
sense 
is 
type 
semantics 
and 
that 
reference 
is 
token 
semantics. 
This 
failure 
led 
Frege 
to 
have 
an 
erroneous 
view 
regarding 
literal 
meaning, 
and 
a 
related 
erroneous 
view 
regarding 
the 
nature 
of 



reference. 
The 
erroneous 
view 
regarding 
literal 
meaning 
is 
this: 
what 
is 
literally 
meant 
by 
occurrences 
of 
(i) 
is 
some 
proposition 
that 
has 
for 
a 
constituent, 
not 
Franklin 
himself, 
but 
some 
concept 
that 
singles 
out 
Franklin 
(namely, 
inventor 
of 
bifocals). 
The 
erroneous 
view 
regarding 
reference 
is 
this: 
if 
e 
refers 
to 
o, 
then 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
"…e…", 
a 
sentence 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
has, 
not 
o 
itself 
as 
a 
constituent, 
but 
some 
sense 
that 
singles 
out 
o. 


I 
believe 
that 
Kaplan 
had 
considerations 
like 
this 
in 
mind 
when 
he 
wrote[80]: 


"Fregean 
sinn 
conflates 
elements 
of 
two 
quite 
different 
notions 
of 
meaning. 
One, 
which 
I 
called 
character, 
is 
closed 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
linguistic 
meaning 
(and 
perhaps 
of 
cognitive 
content). 
Another, 
which 
I 
call 
content, 
is 
what 
is 
expressed 
by 
an 
expression 
in 
a 
particular 
context 
of 
use. 
The 
content 
of 
an 
utterance 
of 
a 
complete 
sentence 
[sentence-token] 
is 
a 
truth-bearing 
proposition. 
Where 
indexicals 
are 
involved, 
the 
difference 
between 
character 
and 
content 
is 
quite 
clear." 


The 
point 
Kaplan 
is 
making 
here 
is 
profound 
and 
correct. 
But 
an 
addition 
must 
be 
made 
to 
it. 
We 
saw 
earlier 
that 
there 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
presemantic 
implicature. 
There 
is 
the 
kind 
associated 
with 
type-semantics 
– 
with 
the 
rules 
that 
assign 
meaning 
to 
expression-tokens. 
But 
there 
is 
also 
the 
kind 
that 
is 
associated 
not 
with 
type-semantics 
itself, 
but 
with 
one’s 
access 
to 
type-semantics. 
Frege 
held 
that 
proper 
names 
have 
both 
sense 
and 
reference: 
he 
didn’t 
confine 
himself 
to 
definite 
descriptions. 
Where 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
concerned, 
sense 
is 
indeed 
type-semantics, 
as 
Kaplan 
says. 
But 
where 
proper 
names 
are 
concern, 
sense 
is 
not 
type-semantics: 
it 
is 
rather 
the 
information 
through 
which 
one 
grasps 
type-semantics. 


Frege 
thought 
that, 
at 
the 
level 
of 
literal 
meaning, 
proper 
names 
("Hesperus" 
and 
"Socrates") 
are 
really 
definite 
descriptions 
("the 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky", 
"the 
great 
philosopher 
who 
died 
of 
hemlock-poisoning"). 
Saul 
Kripke 
(1972, 
1979) 
refuted 
this: 
proper 
names 
have 
no 
sense 
– 
they 
are 
just 
labels. 
(Attempts 
have 
to 
re-descriptivize 
names. 
But 
Soames 
(2001, 
2005) 
did 
a 
good 
job 
of 
shutting 
down 
these 
attempts.) 



But 
Kripke’s 
important 
semantic 
points 
leave 
a 
major 
question 
unanswered. 
In 
fact, 
they 
don’t 
deal 
with 
any 
of 
the 
data 
that 
led 
Frege 
to 
regard 
names 
as 
descriptions. 
Suppose 
"Hesperus" 
and 
"Phosphorous" 
are 
mere 
labels. 
In 
that 
case, 
they 
label 
the 
same 
thing, 
and 
those 
two 
sentences 
have 
exactly 
the 
same 
literal 
meaning. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 


(a) 
"Hesperus 
is 
lovely" 
and 


(b) 
"Phosphorous 
is 
lovely" 
convey 
different 
propositions. 


How 
are 
we 
to 
deal 
with 
this? 
Frege 
answered 
by 
saying 
that 
"Hesperus" 
and 
"Phosphorous" 
are 
not 
mere 
labels. 
Kripke 
refuted 
that 
answer. 
But 
Kripke 
does 
not 
himself 
say 
how 
we 
are 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problem. 


There 
is 
more 
to 
say. 
The 
proposition 
conveyed 
by 
occurrences 
of 
(i) 
has 
as 
a 
constituent 
the 
concept 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky. 
And 
the 
proposition 
conveyed 
by 
occurrences 
of 
(ii) 
has 
as 
a 
constituent 
the 
concept 
first 
celestial 
body 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
evening 
sky. 
Those 
propositions 
are 
exactly 
what 
Frege 
thought. 


So 
even 
though 
"Hesperus" 
and 
"Phosphorous" 
do 
not 
have 
senses 
at 
the 
level 
of 
semantics, 
they 
do 
have 
senses 
at 
the 
level 
of 
implicature. 
What 
exactly 
is 
responsible 
for 
that 
difference 
in 
implicature? 
Here 
we 
cannot 
say 
what 
we 
said 
in 
connection 
with 
definite 
descriptions. 
Tokens 
of 


(i) 
"The 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored." 
differ 
in 
implicature 
from 
tokens 
of 


(ii) 
"The 
first 
post-master 
general 
snored". 
Here 
the 
difference 
lies 
in 
facts 
about 
type-semantics. 
The 
rule 
assigning 
meaning 
to 
tokens 
of 
(i) 
involves 
the 
concept 
unique 
inventor 
of 



bifocals, 
and 
does 
not 
involve 
the 
concept 
first 
post-master 
general. 
It 
is 
the 
other 
way 
around 
as 
regards 
the 
rule 
assigning 
meaning 
to 
tokens 
of 
(ii). 


But 
there 
is 
no 
comparable 
difference 
where 
the 
type-semantics 
of 


(a) 
and 
(b) 
are 
concerned. 
There 
is 
some 
object 
O 
such 
that 
the 
rule 
assigning 
meaning 
to 
tokens 
of 
(a) 
is: 
(ar) 
Tokens 
"Hesperus 
is 
lovely" 
are 
true 
exactly 
if 
O 
is 
lovely. 


And 
there 
is 
some 
object 
O* 
such 
that 
the 
rule 
assigning 
meaning 
to 
tokens 
of 
(b) 
has 
the 
form: 


(br) 
Tokens 
"Phosphorous 
is 
lovely" 
are 
true 
exactly 
if 
O* 
is 
lovely. 


Moreover, 
O 
is 
identical 
with 
O*. 
So 
(ar) 
and 
(br) 
are 
nearly 
enough 
same 
rule. 
The 
only 
difference 
is 
that 
where 
one 
of 
them 
has 
"Hesperus" 
the 
other 
has 
"Phosphorous". 
Neither 
rule 
includes 
the 
concept 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 
or 
the 
concept 
first 
celestial 
body 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
evening 
sky. 
The 
just 
mentioned 
difference 
between 
those 
two 
rules 
is 
far 
too 
trivial 
to 
ground 
the 
massive 
differences 
in 
implicature 
between 
tokens 
of 
(a) 
and 
tokens 
of 
(b). 
The 
cognitive 
difference 
between 
a 
token 
of 
(a) 
and 
a 
token 
of 
(b) 
is 
not 
merely 
verbal; 
it 
isn’t 
merely 
that, 
where 
one 
of 
them 
uses 
one 
expression, 
the 
other 
uses 
a 
different 
expression. 
The 
difference 
isn’t 
comparable 
to 
that 
between 
"Fred 
is 
an 
enemy" 
and 
"Fred 
is 
a 
foe". 
So 
given 
only 
the 
type-semantic 
differences 
corresponding 
to 
(a) 
and 
(b), 
there 
is 
no 
prospect 
of 
explaining 
the 
cognitive 
differences 
between 
tokens 
of 
the 
one 
and 
tokens 
of 
the 
other: 
the 
strategy 
we 
applied 
to 
definite 
descriptions 
won’t 
work 
here. 


In 
this 
case, 
the 
differences 
in 
cognitive 
value 
are 
to 
be 
explained 
not 
in 
terms 
of 
type-semantics, 
but 
in 
terms 
of 
our 
access 
to 
type-semantics. 


Let 
us 
start 
by 
discussing 
the 
semantic 
rules 
associated 
with 
"Hesperus" 
and 
"Phosphorous". 
There 
is 
some 
object 
O 
such 
that 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
the 
type 
"Hesperus" 
is 
this: 



(hr) 
Tokens 
of 
"Hesperus" 
refer 
to 
O. 


And 
there 
is 
some 
object 
O* 
such 
that 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
the 
type 
"Phosphorous" 
is 
this: 


(pr) 
Tokens 
of 
"Phosphorous" 
refer 
to 
O*. 


Since 
O=O*, 
(hr)=(pr). 


Let 
us 
focus 
on 
(hr). 
To 
grasp 
(hr), 
you 
must 
have 
some 
way 
of 
singling 
out 
Hesperus. 
Otherwise, 
you 
will, 
at 
most, 
grasp 
something 
like 
(hr) 
that 
has 
a 
gap 
in 
it 
where 
that 
object 
is 
supposed 
to 
be. 
You 
do 
not 
grasp 
objects 
in 
a 
vacuum. 
For 
reasons 
discussed 
earlier, 
knowledge 
of 
descriptive 
information 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
grasping 
of 
any 
external 
object. 
So 
your 
grasp 
of 
(hr) 
will 
have 
descriptive 
content 
that 
(hr) 
itself 
does 
not. 


Let 
us 
make 
these 
points 
more 
concrete 
by 
considering 
one 
way 
that 
you 
learn 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus". 
Somebody 
says 
to 
you: 


(A) 
"‘Hesperus’ 
is 
the 
name 
of 
the 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky". 
Here 
what 
you 
are 
being 
told 
is: 


(B) 
Something 
x 
is 
a 
unique 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky, 
and 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus" 
is: 
"Hesperus" 
refers 
to 
x. 
What 
you 
are 
being 
told 
is 
not: 


(C) 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus" 
is: 
something 
x 
is 
a 
unique 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 
"Hesperus" 
refers 
to 
x. 
And 
what 
you 
are 
being 
told 
is 
not: 


(D) 
The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus" 
is: 
"Hesperus" 
refers 
to 
anything 
x 
that 
is 
a 
unique 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 

The 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus" 
doesn’t 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
concept 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky. 
There 
are 
possible 
worlds 
where 
the 
type 
"Hesperus", 
as 
well 
as 
its 
tokens, 
have 
the 
same 
semantics 
as 
their 
counterparts 
here, 
but 
where 
Hesperus 
is 
not 
a 
unique 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky. 
(B) 
is 
consistent 
with 
this 
fact. 
(C) 
and 
(D) 
are 
not 
consistent 
with 
it. 


(B) 
gives 
appropriately 
narrow 
scope 
to 
the 
concept 
semantic 
rule. 
Because 
it 
has 
appropriately 
narrow 
scope, 
the 
semantic 
rule 
in 
question 
is 
kept 
pure: 
the 
concept 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 
is 
no 
part 
of 
it. 
(C) 
and 
(D) 
give 
the 
concept 
semantic 
rule 
inappropriately 
wide-
scope. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
concepts 
evening 
sky, 
and 
so 
forth, 
contaminate 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus"; 
so 
(C) 
and 
(D) 
give 
the 
wrong 
semantic 
rule. 
In 
every 
world 
where 
English 
is 
spoken, 
tokens 
of 
"Hesperus" 
refer 
to 
Hesperus. 
(B) 
is 
consistent 
with 
this 
fact. 
(C) 
and 
(D) 
are 
not. 


People 
often 
learn 
the 
semantic 
rules 
for 
proper 
names 
through 
statements 
like 
(A). 
Since 
they 
learn 
the 
right 
rules, 
we 
must 
assume 
that 
they 
give 
appropriately 
wide 
scope 
to 
the 
descriptive 
information 
and 
appropriately 
narrow 
scope 
to 
the 
semantic 
operators. 


You 
do 
not 
learn 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Hesperus" 
in 
a 
vacuum. 
It 
must 
be 
given 
to 
you 
through 
some 
statement 
like 
(A): 
that 
rule 
must 
be 
described 
to 
you. 
The 
rule 
itself 
is 
descriptively 
innocent; 
the 
concept 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 
doesn’t 
make 
it 
in 
there. 
But 
the 
description 
of 
that 
rule 
does 
include 
that 
concept. 
So 
your 
access 
to 
that 
rule 
is 
mediated 
through 
that 
concept. 


What 
tokens 
of 
*Hesperus 
has 
phi* 
convey 
to 
you 
will 
reflect 
the 
descriptive 
information 
through 
which 
you 
access 
their 
literal 
meanings. 
Suppose 
you 
are 
given 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
"Hesperus" 
through 
some 
definition 
like 
(A). 
In 
that 
case, 
you 
access 
that 
semantics 
through 
(B). 
Given 
this, 
what 
a 
token 
of 
*Hesperus 
has 
phi* 
will 
convey 
to 
you 
will 
be 
much 
more 
than 
some 
bare, 
object-dependent 
proposition: 
it 
will 
convey 
to 
you 
(inter 
alia) 
that 
something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
a 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 
and 
that 
x 
has 
phi. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
given 
that 
(B) 
is 
correct, 
there 
is 
some 
object 
O 
such 
that 
the 
literal 
meaning 
of 
such 
a 
token 
is 
simply: 
O 
has 
phi. 


Now 
suppose 
you 
are 
given 
the 
semantics 
of 
"Phosphorous" 
through 
the 
following 
statement: 



(D) 
"Phosphorous" 
is 
the 
name 
of 
the 
first 
celestial 
body 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
evening 
sky. 
For 
reasons 
exactly 
similar 
to 
those 
just 
given, 
what 
a 
token 
of 
*Phosphorus 
has 
phi* 
will 
convey 
to 
you 
will 
be 
(inter 
alia) 
that 
something 
x 
is 
uniquely 
a 
first 
celestial 
body 
to 
appear 
from 
the 
evening 
sky 
and 
that 
x 
has 
phi. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
is 
some 
object 
O 
such 
that 
the 
literal 
meaning 
of 
such 
a 
token 
is 
simply: 
O 
has 
phi. 


There 
is 
more 
to 
say. 
Any 
competent 
speaker 
would 
take 
(A) 
in 
the 
right 
way; 
that 
person 
would 
give 
the 
amount 
of 
scope 
to 
the 
relevant 
operators. 
As 
a 
result, 
that 
person 
will 
have 
the 
right 
modal 
intuitions. 
That 
person 
will 
not 
think 
it 
necessary 
that 
anything 
be 
a 
unique 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky. 
And 
that 
person 
will 
not 
regard 
as 
analytic 
– 
as 
holding 
merely 
in 
virtue 
of 
linguistic 
rules 
--the 
statement 
"Hesperus 
is 
the 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky". 
After 
all, 
that 
person 
gave 
appropriately 
narrow 
scope 
to 
the 
concept 
semantic 
rule 


– 
that 
person 
took 
(A) 
to 
mean 
(B), 
and 
not 
(C) 
or 
(D). 
So 
that 
person 
knows 
that 
the 
semantics 
of 
"Hesperus" 
do 
not 
require 
that 
tokens 
of 
"Hesperus" 
refer 
to 
a 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky. 
Exactly 
similar 
remarks 
apply 
to 
(D). 
So 
that 
person 
will 
have 
all 
the 
right 
intuitions 
about 
modality 
and 
analyticity. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
for 
the 
reasons 
discussed 
a 
moment 
ago, 
what 
tokens 
*Hesperus 
has 
phi* 
convey 
to 
her 
will 
be 
very 
different 
from 
what 
is 
conveyed 
by 
tokens 
of 
*Phosphorus 
has 
phi*. 
Moreover, 
what 
is 
conveyed 
by 
such 
tokens 
will 
correspond 
to 
what 
Frege 
saw 
as 
the 
literal 
meanings 
of 
those 
utterances. 
As 
we 
just 
saw, 
what 
is 
conveyed 
by 
those 
tokens 
doesn’t 
correspond 
to 
type-meaning: 
it 
corresponds 
to 
one’s 
access 
to 
type-meaning. 
The 
concept 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
disappear 
from 
the 
morning 
sky 
isn’t 
part 
of 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
type 
"Hesperus"; 
it 
is, 
at 
most, 
a 
part 
of 
one’s 
access 
to 
the 
semantics 
of 
that 
type. 
Exactly 
similar 
remarks 
apply 
to 
every 
proper 
name. 
Where 
any 
proper 
name 
is 
concerned, 
Fregean 
sense 
corresponds 
not 
to 
type-semantics, 
but 
to 
one’s 
access 
to 
type-
semantics. 
So, 
where 
proper 
names 
are 
concerned, 
Frege’s 
conception 
of 
"sense" 
is 
not 
a 
conflation 
of 
token-meaning 
with 
type-meaning, 
but 
of 
token-
meaning 
with 
the 
information 
through 
which 
one 
grasps 
type-meaning. 
If 
we 
think 
of 
type-meaning 
as 
"pre-semantics" 
– 
the 
semantic 
content 
which 
assigns 
semantic 
contents 
to 
tokens 
– 
then 
the 
information 
through 
which 
one 

grasps 
type-meaning 
is 
pre-pre-semantics: 
it 
is 
the 
information 
which 
enables 
one 
to 
grasp 
the 
information 
which, 
in 
its 
turn, 
enables 
one 
to 
compute 
token-
meaning. 
So 
Frege’s 
view 
that 
proper 
names 
have 
senses 
is 
a 
conflation 
not 
of 
semantics 
(token 
meaning) 
with 
pre-semantics 
(type-meaning), 
but 
of 
semantics 
with 
pre-pre-semantics. 


§ 
Here 
we 
must 
discuss 
an 
ambiguity 
in 
the 
term 
"meaning". 
At 
first, 
this 
ambiguity 
might 
seem 
to 
bear 
against 
our 
view 
that, 
where 
devices 
of 
reference 
are 
concerned, 
there 
is 
no 
knowledge 
of 
meaning 
without 
knowledge 
of 
referent. 


Let 
us 
tell 
a 
story. 
Your 
friend 
Smith 
is 
a 
Finn 
who 
does 
not 
speak 
English. 
But 
you 
speak 
both 
Finnish 
and 
English. 
One 
day, 
you 
and 
Smith 
hear 
: 


(*) 
"If 
penguins 
liked 
classical 
music, 
and 
they 
were 
analytical 
as 
opposed 
to 
emotional 
in 
temperament, 
then 
they 
would 
prefer 
Beethoven 
to 
Chopin." 


(Suppose 
that 
(*) 
is 
a 
particular 
utterance.) 
Of 
course, 
you 
understand 
this 
utterance 
perfectly 
well. 
But 
Smith 
does 
not. 
But 
you 
tell 
Smith 
that 
(*) 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 


(**) 
If 
penguins 
liked 
classical 
music, 
and 
they 
were 
analytical 
as 
opposed 
to 
emotional 
in 
temperament, 
then 
they 
would 
prefer 
Beethoven 
to 
Chopin. 


So 
now 
Smith 
knows 
exactly 
which 
proposition 
is 
encoded 
in 
(*). 
Question: 
Does 
Smith 
understand 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
(*)? 
The 
obvious 
answer 
is: 
"yes 
– 
to 
understand 
an 
utterance 
is 
to 
know 
which 
proposition 
it 
encodes; 
and 
this 
is 
exactly 
what 
Smith 
knows 
in 
the 
case 
in 
question." 
But 
there 
is 
plainly 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
you 
do, 
and 
Smith 
does 
not, 
(*). 
You 
know 
the 
"derivation 
tree" 
for 
that 
utterance. 
You 
know 
not 
only 
that 
(*) 
encodes 
(**); 
you 
also 
know 
how 
(*) 
it 
encodes 
(**). 
You 
know 
that 
"penguins" 
means 
penguins; 
you 
even 
know 
that 
the 
"s" 
in 
that 
word 
indicates 
plurality; 
you 
know 
that 
"would" 
indicates 
the 
conditional 
mood; 
that 
"prefer" 
refers 
to 
a 
certain 
propositional 
attitude; 
and 
so 
on. 
Smith 
doesn’t 
know 
of 
any 
of 
this. 
Really, 
what 
Smith 
knows 
is 
not 
that 
(*) 
means 
(**); 
what 
he 
knows 
is 
that: 



(***) 
"ifpenguinslikedclassicalmusicandtheywereanalyticalasopposedtoemotionalin 
temperamentthentheywouldprefertobeethoventobhopin." 


means 
(**). 


Where 
you 
hear 
articulations, 
Smith 
hears 
mere 
noise. 
Smith 
knows 
that 
(***) 
as 
a 
whole 
encodes 
(**), 
but 
he 
doesn’t 
know 
how 
this 
encoding 
is 
done 
exactly. 
Speaking 
not 
very 
accurately, 
we 
might 
say 
that 
Smith 
doesn’t 
know 
the 
right 
"derivation 
tree". 


Here 
is 
the 
moral 
of 
the 
story. 
To 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence-
level 
utterance 
is 
not 
to 
know 
which 
proposition 
is 
encoded 
in 
it. 
It 
is 
to 
know 
how 
hook 
up 
that 
utterance 
to 
the 
right 
proposition. 
To 
understand 
is 
to 
know 
how 
to 
use 
linguistic 
rules 
to 
find 
the 
right 
proposition. 
If 
you 
don’t 
have 
this 
knowledge, 
then 
all 
you 
have 
is 
the 
pseudo-understanding 
that 
Smith 
has. 


Here 
is 
a 
parallel. 
(I 
am 
going 
to 
speak 
very 
elliptically, 
since 
the 
nuances 
are 
not 
relevant.) 
There 
is 
a 
big 
difference 
between 
knowing 
that 
Fermat’s 
theorem 
is 
true, 
and 
knowing 
why 
it 
is 
true. 
I 
can 
learn 
the 
former 
by 
being 
told 
as 
much 
by 
a 
reliable 
mathematician: 
personal 
testimony 
is 
enough 
– 
no 
mathematical 
acumen 
is 
needed. 
But 
I 
cannot 
possibly 
understand 
why 
it 
is 
true 
unless 
I 
am 
able 
to 
follow 
the 
relevant 
proof. 
So 
understanding 
consists 
in 
knowledge 
of 
derivations, 
not 
in 
knowledge 
of 
theorems. 
So 
far 
as 
(*) 
is 
concerned, 
what 
Smith 
is 
knowledge 
of 
a 
theorem, 
not 
knowledge 
of 
a 
derivation. 
(This 
is 
literally 
the 
case 
– 
at 
least 
if 
we 
conceive 
of 
languages 
as 
calculi. 
If 
that 
is 
the 
conception, 
then 
all 
derived 
semantic 
rules 
are 
theorems; 
and 
any 
act 
of 
computing 
literal 
meaning 
is 
the 
act 
of 
deriving 
or 
proving 
a 
theorem. 
For 
the 
record, 
this 
is 
how 
I 
think 
of 
languages.) 


Let 
us 
encode 
this 
in 
the 
following 
slogan 
(it 
is 
understood 
that 
the 
"meanings" 
referred 
to 
are 
those 
associated 
with 
sentence-level 
utterances): 


(KDT) 
"Knowledge 
of 
meaning= 
knowledge 
of 
derivation 
tree." 


(KDT) 
is 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 


(KP) 
"Knowledge 
of 
meaning=knowledge 
of 
proposition 
alone." 



Supposedly, 
we 
have 
just 
seen 
that 
(KP) 
is 
false 
and 
that 
(KDT) 
is 
true. 


Here 
is 
where 
the 
problem 
for 
our 
position 
begins. 
The 
position 
we 
rejected 
but 
that 
is 
intuitively 
very 
reasonable 
is 
this: 


Some 
evil 
person 
stole 
Jones’ 
wallet. 
Jones 
says 
to 
me: 
"the 
man 
who 
stole 
my 
wallet 
is 
not 
a 
person 
of 
high 
morality". 
I 
don’t 
know 
who 
the 
thief 
in 
question 
is. 
So 
I 
don’t 
know 
to 
whom 
"the 
man 
who 
stole 
my 
wallet" 
refers. 
But 
I 
obviously 
understand 
what 
Jones 
said. 
And 
it 
is 
also 
pretty 
clear 
that 
"the 
man 
who 
stole 
my 
wallet" 
refers 
to 
somebody 
– 
it 
refers 
to 
the 
man 
who 
stole 
my 
wallet. 


Here 
is 
what 
we 
said 
(it 
is 
similar 
to 
what 
Russell 
said 
many 
times). 
If 
the 
utterance 
of 
"the 
man 
who 
stole 
my 
wallet" 
really 
is 
a 
referring 
term, 
as 
opposed 
to 
a 
quantifier, 
then 
for 
some 
individual 
O, 
Jones’ 
utterance 
has 
for 
its 
literal 
meaning 
the 
proposition: 
O 
stole 
my 
[Jones’] 
wallet. 
So 
if 
the 
definite 
description 
refers 
to 
somebody, 
then 
you 
don’t 
understand 
that 
token 
unless 
you 
know 
that 
it 
was 
(say) 
Brown 
who 
stole 
the 
wallet. 


It 
might 
be 
said 
that 
our 
position 
presupposes 
(KP) 
– 
the 
idea 
that 
(for 
sentence-level 
utterances) 
to 
know 
an 
expression 
means 
is 
to 
know 
what 
proposition 
it 
encodes. 
But 
the 
right 
principle, 
supposedly, 
is 
(KDT) 
– 
to 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence-level 
(or 
otherwise 
complex) 
expression 
is 
to 
know 
its 
derivation 
tree. 
So 
to 
understand 
the 
utterance 
in 
question 
of 
"the 
man 
who 
stole 
my 
wallet 
is 
not 
a 
person 
of 
high 
morality" 
is 
to 
know 
how 
to 
assign 
it 
the 
right 
proposition, 
not 
which 
proposition 
it 
encodes. 
This 
applies, 
in 
particular, 
to 
the 
definite 
description. 
To 
understand 
it 
is 
not 
to 
know 
which 
thing 
it 
refers 
to; 
it 
is 
to 
know 
how 
to 
"hook 
it 
up" 
to 
the 
right 
thing 
by 
manipulating 
the 
relevant 
semantic 
rules. 


So 
a 
more 
refined 
conception 
of 
linguistic 
understanding 
bears 
out 
the 
intuition 
– 
whose 
correctness 
we 
denied 
– 
that 
one 
can 
understand 
a 
token 
of 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
without 
knowing 
who 
the 
phi 
is. 


Here 
is 
what 
I 
say 
to 
this. 
I 
agree 
that 
true 
understanding 
involves 
knowledge 
of 
the 
right 
"derivation 
tree". 
But 
knowledge 
of 
the 
right 
derivation-tree 
relates 
to 
understanding 
the 
relevant 
type. 
(KDT) 
is 
true 
of 
type-understanding. 
(KP) 
is 
true 
of 
token-understanding. 


There 
is 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(*). 
And 
then 
there 
is 
a 



proposition 
saying 
how 
to 
compute 
the 
proposition 
meant 
by 
(*). 
The 
latter 
is 
the 
proposition 
that 
gives 
the 
"derivation 
tree" 
for 
(*). 
Consider 
the 
sentence-
type 
corresponding 
to 
(*). 
To 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
that 
sentence-type 
is 
to 
know 
how 
to 
compute, 
or 
derive, 
the 
meanings 
of 
its 
tokens. 
So 
knowledge 
of 
derivation-trees 
is 
type-knowledge. 
To 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
token 
is 
to 
know 
which 
proposition 
lies 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
derivation 
tree. 


Let 
us 
sum 
up. 
There 
is 
indeed 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
Smith 
does 
not 
understand 
(*). 
But 
what 
he 
doesn’t 
understand 
is 
the 
corresponding 
type 
– 
he 
doesn’t 
know 
the 
rules 
which 
assign 
meaning 
to 
(*). 
But, 
thanks 
to 
your 
testimony, 
he 
does 
know 
the 
meaning 
of 
(*). 
So 
nothing 
that 
we’ve 
seen 
in 
connection 
with 
(*) 
warrants 
any 
rejection 
of 
the 
view 
that 
to 
understand 
a 
token 
is 
to 
know 
which 
proposition 
it 
means. 


Thus 
our 
defense 
of 
(NKT) 
remains 
intact. 
As 
we 
saw, 
if 
a 
token 
of 
*the 
phi* 
refers 
to 
O, 
then 
a 
token 
t 
of 
*the 
phi 
has 
psi* 
encodes 
the 
proposition 
O 
has 
psi. 
If 
the 
concept 
phi 
were 
to 
make 
it 
into 
that 
proposition, 
then 
*the 
phi* 
would 
be 
a 
quantifier. 
So 
if 
you 
don’t 
know 
that 
t 
encodes 
the 
proposition 
O 
has 
phi, 
then 
you 
don’t 
know 
what 
it 
means. 
And 
if 
you 
don’t 
know 
that 
the 
occurrence, 
in 
t, 
of 
*the 
phi* 
refers 
to 
O, 
then 
you 
don’t 
know 
what 
that 
occurrence 
means. 
Once 
again 
– 
where 
referring 
terms 
are 
concerned, 
there 
is 
no 
knowledge 
of 
meaning 
without 
knowledge 
of 
referent. 


§ 
A 
failure 
to 
distinguish 
between 
what 
we 
just 
called 
"pre-
semantics" 
and 
"pre-pre-semantics" 
lies 
at 
the 
root 
of 
the 
failure 
on 
the 
part 
of 
semanticists 
to 
account 
for 
the 
cognitive 
values 
had 
by 
sentence-tokens 
containing 
indexicals. 


Given 
what 
Kaplan 
(1989) 
argues, 
it 
seems 
pretty 
clear 
that 
tokens 
of 
demonstratives 
are 
"directly 
referential". 
If 
Fred 
says 
"I 
am 
tall", 
his 
utterance 
literally 
means: 
Fred 
is 
tall. 
If 
somebody 
says 
"that 
man 
is 
tall", 
and 
Fred 
is 
the 
man 
in 
question, 
that 
utterance 
literally 
means: 
Fred 
is 
tall. 
If 
Fred 
says 
"I 
am 
that 
man", 
and 
his 
statement 
is 
true, 
then 
his 
utterance 
literally 
means: 
Fred 
is 
Fred. 
Suppose 
Fred 
then 
says: 
"I 
am 
not 
that 
man." 
In 
that 
case, 
the 
literal 
meaning 
of 
his 
utterance 
is 
a 
contradiction: 
Fred 
is 
not 
Fred. 


Kaplan’s 
arguments 
for 
his 
position 
are 
compelling 
– 
I 
myself 
accept 
his 
position 
as 
well 
his 
arguments 
for 
them. 
But 
as 
we 
just 
saw, 
if 
Kaplan 
is 
right, 
then 
what 
indexical 
sentence-tokens 
communicate 
is 
extremely 
remote 
from 
what 
they 
literally 
mean. 
As 
we 
saw 
earlier 
in 
connection 
with 
both 



names 
and 
definite 
descriptions, 
this 
by 
itself 
doesn’t 
even 
constitute 
prima 
facie 
evidence 
that 
Kaplan’s 
position 
is 
wrong. 
But 
it 
is 
still 
worth 
knowing 
why 
the 
propositions 
communicated 
by 
indexical 
sentence-tokens 
are 
so 
different 
from 
the 
ones 
they 
literally 
mean; 
and 
it 
is 
also 
worth 
knowing 
what 
it 
is 
exactly 
that 
such 
tokens 
communicate. 


Let 
us 
start 
with 
some 
background. 
Kaplan 
distinguishes 
between 
an 
indexical’s 
"character" 
and 
its 
"content". 
Character 
is 
a 
feature 
of 
indexical 
types 
and 
content 
is 
a 
feature 
of 
indexical 
tokens. 
The 
character 
of 
an 
indexical 
is 
a 
rule 
that 
assigns 
referents 
to 
its 
tokens. 
For 
example, 
the 
character 
of 
"I" 
is 
some 
rule 
like: 
if 
x 
is 
speaking, 
then 
a 
token 
of 
"I" 
refers 
to 


x. 
What 
character 
calls 
the 
"content" 
of 
an 
indexical 
token 
is 
the 
thing 
which 
the 
corresponding 
type 
assigns 
to 
that 
particular 
token. 
So 
if 
Fred 
says 
"I", 
the 
content 
of 
that 
token 
is 
Fred 
himself. 
What 
Kaplan 
calls 
"character" 
is 
clearly 
a 
kind 
of 
type-semantics’, 
and 
what 
he 
calls 
"content" 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
token-semantics. 
Kaplan 
extends 
the 
notions 
of 
character 
and 
content 
to 
whole 
sentences. 
The 
character 
of 
the 
type 
"I 
am 
tired" 
is 
a 
rule 
that 
assigns 
propositions 
to 
each 
token 
of 
that 
type. 
(In 
this 
case, 
the 
character 
would 
be 
a 
rule 
like: 
If, 
at 
time 
t, 
so 
and 
so 
says 
"I 
am 
tired", 
then 
that 
token 
has 
for 
its 
literal 
meaning 
the 
proposition: 
so 
and 
so 
is 
tired 
at 
t. 
)The 
content 
of 
a 
particular 
token 
is 
the 
proposition 
that 
the 
corresponding 
character 
associates 
with 
it. 
So 
if 
Fred 
says 
"I 
am 
tired" 
at 
t, 
then 
the 
content 
of 
that 
token 
is: 
Fred 
is 
tired 
at 
t. 


An 
utterance 
of 
"I 
am 
tall" 
and 
"that 
man 
is 
tall" 
have 
different 
cognitive 
values 
even 
if, 
in 
both 
cases, 
the 
indexical 
refers 
to 
Fred. 
The 
obvious 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
is 
to 
say 
that 
the 
cognitive 
differences 
result 
from 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
characters 
associated 
with 
the 
indexicals. 


How 
exactly 
is 
this 
supposed 
to 
work? 
Here 
we 
can 
tell 
a 
story 
similar 
to 
ones 
told 
earlier. 
When 
you 
hear 
an 
utterance 
of 
"I 
am 
tall", 
you 
don’t 
automatically 
know 
its 
meaning; 
you 
have 
to 
compute 
its 
meaning 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
relevant 
semantic 
rules 
– 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
type-semantics. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
rule 
is: 
if 
so 
and 
so 
says 
"I 
am 
tired" 
at 
time 
t, 
then 
that 
token 
encodes 
the 
proposition 
so 
and 
so 
is 
tired 
at 
t. 
So 
anyone 
who 
knows 
that 
rule 
will 
know 
that 
a 
given 
utterance 
of 
"I 
am 
tired" 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
there 
is 
a 
unique 
producer 
x 
of 
those 
sounds, 
and 
x 
is 
tired. 
So 
such 
an 
utterance 
conveys 
an 
existential 
proposition, 
even 
though 
it 
doesn’t 
semantically 
encode 
one. 
The 
same 
story 
applies 
to 
"that 
man 
is 
tired", 
except 
that, 
in 
this 



case, 
the 
rule 
is: 
if 
in 
context 
C, 
so 
and 
so 
is 
a 
salient 
man, 
then 
a 
token 
of 
"that 
man 
is 
tired" 
at 
t 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
so 
and 
so 
is 
tired 
at 
t. 
So 
such 
an 
utterance 
conveys 
an 
existential 
proposition, 
even 
though 
it 
doesn’t 
semantically 
encode 
one. 
The 
existential 
proposition 
conveyed 
by 
the 
one 
token 
is 
very 
different 
from 
that 
conveyed 
by 
the 
other: 
neither 
entails 
the 
other. 
So, 
it 
seems, 
when 
we 
take 
character 
(type-semantics) 
into 
account, 
we 
have 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
deviations 
between 
cognitive 
and 
literal 
meaning. 


Here 
is 
my 
view. 
The 
character-content 
distinction 
is 
obviously 
part 
of 
the 
story: 
what 
was 
just 
said 
is 
correct 
so 
far 
as 
it 
goes. 
But 
it 
is 
incomplete. 
But 
there 
are 
a 
couple 
of 
reasons 
why 
that 
distinction 
cannot, 
by 
itself, 
provide 
a 
general 
explanation 
of 
the 
cognitive 
significances 
of 
indexical-tokens 
and, 
in 
fact, 
why 
it 
cannot 
even 
provide 
a 
complete 
explanation 
of 
the 
cognitive 
significance 
of 
a 
single 
indexical-token. 


Suppose 
at 
t 
there 
is 
some 
man 
wearing 
a 
disguise 
who 
is 
acting 
very 
strangely. 
You 
say 
"that 
individual 
is 
insane". 
As 
it 
happens, 
the 
individual 
in 
question 
is 
Smith. 
Later, 
you 
bump 
into 
Smith 
at 
a 
party. 
He 
is 
acting 
very 
sanely. 
You 
say 
"that 
individual 
is 
sane." 
According 
to 
Kaplan, 
the 
first 
utterance 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
Smith 
is 
insane, 
and 
the 
second 
encodes 
the 
proposition 
Smith 
is 
sane. 
So 
if 
we 
focus 
on 
literal 
meaning, 
you’ve 
contradicted 
yourself. 
But 
obviously 
you 
haven’t 
really 
contradicted 
yourself: 
at 
the 
level 
of 
what 
is 
implicated 
(of 
what 
is 
communicated 
but 
not 
literally 
meant), 
what 
you’ve 
said 
is 
consistent. 
You 
are 
not 
in 
the 
same 
category 
as 
somebody 
who 
has 
said 
"that 
man 
is 
both 
sane 
and 
insane". 
Here 
we 
cannot 
use 
the 
content-character 
distinction 
to 
any 
advantage. 
In 
both 
cases, 
the 
content 
of 
the 
indexical 
is 
the 
same 
(Smith), 
and 
so 
is 
the 
character 


– 
after 
all, 
the 
same 
indexical 
was 
tokened 
on 
both 
occasions. 
To 
deal 
with 
this 
case, 
we 
have 
to 
go 
beyond 
semantics 
– 
we 
must 
do 
a 
little 
epistemology. 
As 
we 
said 
earlier, 
any 
sense-perception 
is 
descriptive. 
You 
don’t 
just 
see 
Smith; 
you 
see 
a 
thing 
with 
such 
and 
such 
properties. 
Roughly, 
you 
see 
states 
of 
affairs, 
not 
things. 
Given 
this, 
let 
us 
consider 
the 
story 
just 
told, 
focusing 
on 
your 
utterance 
of 
"that 
man 
is 
insane". 
You 
were 
seeing 
Smith. 
You 
weren’t 
just 
seeing 
Smith. 
You 
were 
seeing 
a 
man 
dressed 
like 
a 
pirate, 
jabbering 
incoherently, 
brandishing 
a 
saber, 
and 
so 
forth. 
And 
you 
didn’t 
just 
see 
a 
man 
with 
those 
properties; 
you 
saw 
him 
as 
being 
in 
a 
certain 
place 
– 
he 
is 
over 
there, 
next 
to 
that 
beige 
Buick. 
Now 
consider 
the 
person 
to 
whom 
you 
directed 
your 
utterance 
of 
"that 
man 
is 
insane". 
What 
we 
just 
said 
about 
what 
you 
saw 
applies 
to 
that 
person 



(give 
or 
take 
some 
niceties 
relating 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
wasn’t 
standing 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
place 
as 
you). 
So 
the 
proposition 
communicated 
to 
your 
companion 
was 
not 
Smith 
is 
insane, 
but 
rather: 


(*) 
Over 
there 
next 
to 
that 
Buick, 
there 
is 
a 
man 
x 
dressed 
like 
a 
pirate, 
jabbering 
incoherently, 
brandishing 
a 
saber, 
and 
x 
is 
insane. 


Now 
let 
us 
focus 
on 
your 
utterance 
of 
"that 
man 
is 
sane". 
Similar 
remarks 
apply. 
You 
weren’t 
just 
seeing 
Smith; 
you 
were 
seeing 
a 
man 
who 
was 
wearing 
a 
tuxedo, 
and 
saying 
very 
intelligent 
things 
in 
a 
very 
erudite 
manner. 
And 
you 
saw 
him 
as 
being 
under 
a 
certain 
chandelier, 
next 
to 
a 
certain 
Rothko 
painting. 
What 
we 
just 
said 
about 
what 
you 
is 
true 
(give 
or 
take 
a 
few 
nuances 
relating 
to 
spatial 
location) 
to 
the 
person 
to 
whom 
you 
addressed 
your 
comment. 
So 
what 
was 
communicated 
by 
your 
utterance 
was: 


(**) 
Over 
there, 
next 
to 
that 
Rothko 
painting, 
there 
is 
a 
man 
x 
dressed 
in 
a 
tuxedo, 
saying 
very 
intelligent 
things, 
and 
x 
is 
sane. 


Obviously 
(*) 
and 
(**) 
do 
not 
contradict 
each 
other. 


So 
when 
we 
focus 
on 
what 
is 
communicated 
by 
your 
utterances 
of 
"that 
man 
is 
sane" 
and 
"that 
man 
is 
insane", 
we 
see 
that 
you 
were 
not 
guilty 
of 
incoherence 
in 
virtue 
of 
making 
those 
statements 
(even 
though 
their 
literal 
meanings 
contradict 
each 
other). 
But 
consideration 
of 
the 
character-content 
distinction 
is 
not 
enough: 
we 
had 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
descriptive 
nature 
of 
sense-perception; 
we 
have 
to 
be 
very 
careful 
in 
our 
description 
of 
what 
it 
was, 
exactly, 
that 
was 
seen. 


This 
helps 
solve 
a 
problem 
that 
Kaplan 
himself 
identified 
for 
his 
own 
theory. 
In 
the 
late 
morning, 
you 
point 
up 
at 
the 
sky, 
at 
the 
last 
celestial 
body 
to 
remain 
visible. 
You 
say 
"that" 
very 
slowly. 
After 
a 
few 
hours, 
you 
say 
"is 
identical 
with". 
Then, 
the 
moment 
a 
celestial 
body 
becomes 
visible 
in 
the 
evening 
sky, 
you 
say 
"that". 
So 
you 
have 
said 
"that 
is 
that", 
though 
very 
slowly. 
The 
referent 
of 
the 
first 
"that’ 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
referent 
of 
the 
alter. 
So, 
if 
Kaplan’s 
theory 
is 
right, 
then 
that 
utterance 
encodes 
a 
trivial 
proposition, 
one 
of 
the 
form: 
O 
is 
identical 
with 
O. 
(In 
fact, 
it 
encodes 
the 
proposition 
Venus=Venus.) 
But 
obviously 
what 
was 
communicated 
was 
not 
trivial 
at 
all. 



How 
do 
we 
deal 
with 
this? 
The 
character-content 
distinction 
isn’t 
much 
help, 
since 
the 
same 
character, 
and 
the 
same 
content, 
is 
involved 
in 
both 
cases. 
Here 
we 
need 
to 
apply 
the 
same 
method 
as 
before. 
Consider 
the 
first 
utterance 
of 
"that". 
What 
was 
the 
visual 
perception 
you 
had 
in 
connection 
with 
that 
utterance? 
You 
weren’t 
just 
seeing 
Venus. 
You 
were 
seeing 
a 
celestial 
body 
that 
alone 
occupied 
the 
late 
morning 
sky. 
(Of 
course, 
you 
were 
seeing 
much 
more 
than 
this: 
imagine 
all 
the 
data 
that 
go 
into 
a 
visual 
perception: 
the 
specificity 
of 
it 
– 
all 
the 
spatial 
and 
chromatic 
content.) 
So 
what 
was 
pointed 
out 
was 
not 
just 
Venus; 
what 
was 
pointed 
out 
would 
be 
given 
(partially, 
though 
not 
completely) 
by 
the 
expression 
"occupant 
of 
the 
late 
morning 
sky", 
or 
some 
such. 
And, 
for 
exactly 
similar 
reasons, 
the 
perception 
you 
had 
in 
connection 
with 
your 
second 
utterance 
of 
"that" 
was 
not 
(just) 
Venus; 
what 
was 
pointed 
out 
would 
be 
given 
(partially, 
though 
not 
completely) 
by 
the 
expression 
"sole 
occupant 
of 
the 
early 
evening 
sky", 
or 
some 
such. 
So 
your 
utterance 
of 
"that 
is 
identical 
with 
that" 
implicated 
an 
existential 
proposition: 
there 
is 
some 
sole 
occupant 
x 
of 
the 
late 
morning 
sky, 
and 
there 
is 
some 
sole 
occupant 
y 
of 
the 
early 
evening 
sky, 
and 
x=y. 
So 
even 
though 
what 
was 
literally 
meant 
by 
your 
utterance 
of 
"that 
is 
identical 
with 
that" 
is 
simply 
Venus=Venus, 
what 
was 
communicated 
was 
a 
non-trivial, 
non-analytic 
existence 
claim. 
To 
sum 
up, 
once 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
descriptive 
(or 
"predicational") 
nature 
of 
sense-perception, 
along 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
utterances 
have 
to 
be 
interpreted 
in 
light 
of 
such 
information, 
it 
becomes 
clear 
what 
indexical 
utterances 
communicate. 
In 
connection 
with 
this, 
it 
becomes 
clear 
why 
utterances 
that, 
at 
the 
level 
of 
literal 
meaning, 
are 
absurd 
or 
trivial, 
may 
be 
non-trivial 
or 
true 
(or 
both) 
at 
the 
level 
of 
implicature. 


Later 
we 
will 
see 
how 
this 
line 
of 
thought 
applies 
to 
Kripke’s 
famed 
Pierre-paradox 
and 
how 
it 
rehabilitates 
an 
age-old 
conception 
of 
rationality. 


§ 
For 
the 
moment, 
let 
us 
adopt 
a 
Fregean 
semantic 
stance. 
This 
involves 
suppressing 
our 
sensitivity 
to 
the 
distinction 
between 
type-and 
token-semantics. 


The 
distinction 
between 
"sense" 
and 
"reference" 
is 
close 
to, 
if 
not 
identical 
with, 
the 
distinction 
between 
"intension" 
and 
"extension". 
The 
sense 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
the 
concept 
(or 
property) 
unique 
inventor 
of 
bifocals. 
The 
referent 
is 
the 
thing 
to 
which 
that 
concept 
applies 
(or 
which 
has 
the 
property). 
The 
sense-reference 
distinction 
applies 
to 
singular 
terms. 


The 
intension-extension 
distinction 
is 
the 
corresponding 
distinction 



for 
plural 
terms. 
Consider 
the 
expression 
"rhenates". 
The 
intension 
is 
the 
concept 
thing 
with 
a 
kidney 
(or, 
perhaps, 
the 
property 
of 
having 
a 
kidney). 
The 
extension 
is 
the 
class 
of 
things 
having 
kidneys. 
The 
intension 
of 
"rhenate" 
is 
different 
from 
the 
intension 
of 
"chordate". 
But 
they 
have 
the 
same 
extension. 


We 
found 
that, 
where 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
concerned, 
"sense" 
is 
type-semantics 
and 
"reference" 
is 
token 
semantics. 
There 
is 
no 
one 
entity 
that 
has 
both 
sense 
and 
reference. 
The 
type 
has 
sense. 
The 
token 
has 
reference. 
Where 
plural 
referring 
terms 
are 
concerned, 
an 
exactly 
similar 
thing 
is 
true 
of 
intension 
and 
extension. 
There 
is 
no 
one 
expression 
that 
has 
both 
intension 
and 
extension. 
The 
type 
has 
intension. 
The 
token 
has 
extension. 
It 
would 
be 
incoherent 
to 
say 
that 
some 
one 
expression 
has 
both 
intension 
and 
extension: 
that 
position 
leads 
to 
a 
contradiction. 


Let 
us 
start 
with 
a 
more 
straightforward 
case 
of 
an 
expression 
that 
is 
alleged 
to 
have 
both 
extension 
and 
intension. 


The 
word 
"whale", 
we 
are 
told, 
has 
both 
intension 
and 
extension. 
The 
intension 
is 
a 
property 
or 
function 
(from 
objects 
to 
truth-values). 
The 
extension 
is 
the 
class 
of 
whales 
(Shamu, 
Willy, 
Moby 
Dick…) 


We 
don’t 
want 
to 
say 
that 
the 
expression-type 
"whale" 
denotes 
different 
classes 
in 
different 
worlds, 
while 
having 
the 
same 
semantics. 
That 
is 
perilously 
close 
to 
absurdity. 
The 
extension 
of 
a 
term 
is 
the 
set 
of 
objects 
that 
it 
refers 
to. 
So 
unless 
we 
divorce 
reference 
from 
semantic 
content, 
it 
is 
self-
contradictory 
to 
say 
that 
"whale" 
has 
the 
same 
semantics 
in 
worlds 
where 
it 
has 
different 
extensions. 


What 
we 
must 
say 
is: 
tokens 
of 
"whales" 
denote 
different 
classes 
in 
different 
worlds; 
the 
type 
has 
an 
invariant 
meaning: 
it 
pairs 
off 
a 
token 
of 
"whale" 
in 
a 
world 
W 
with 
a 
class 
C 
iff 
C 
is 
the 
class 
containing 
all 
and 
only 
whales 
in 
W. 


The 
type 
"whale" 
has 
an 
intension. 
That 
intension 
of 
"whale" 
is 
a 
function 
from 
worlds 
to 
classes: 
a 
function 
that 
assigns 
truth 
to 
a 
class 
C 
in 
a 
world 
w 
exactly 
if 
C 
comprises 
all 
the 
whales 
in 
w 
and 
nothing 
that 
is 
not 
a 
whale. 


Tokens 
of 
"whale" 
have 
extensions. 
In 
this 
world 
(at 
this 
time), 
it 
has 
as 
its 
extension 
the 
class 
containing 
all 
and 
only: 
Shamu, 
Willy… 


But 
there 
is 
no 
one 
entity 
that 
has 
both 
intension 
and 
extension. 
Tokens 
of 
"whale" 
have 
extension; 
the 
expression-type 
"whale" 
has 
intension. 
Nothing 
has 
both. 
If 
we 
say 
otherwise, 
then 
we 
must 
say 
that 



"whale" 
can 
have 
the 
same 
semantics 
in 
both 
w1 
and 
w2, 
even 
though 
it 
picks 
out 
one 
set 
of 
objects 
in 
w1 
and 
a 
different 
set 
of 
objects 
in 
w2. 
So 
we 
would 
end 
up 
having 
to 
say 
that 
"whale" 
has 
the 
same 
semantics 
in 
both 
worlds, 
but 
picks 
out 
different 
things. 
To 
avoid 
self-contradiction, 
we 
must 
then 
say 
that 
what 
an 
expression 
picks 
out 
is 
no 
part 
of 
its 
semantics. 
But 
surely 
that 
is 
absurd 
– 
even 
though 
a 
century 
of 
Fregeanism 
has 
brainwashed 
us 
into 
thinking 
otherwise. 
What 
could 
be 
more 
integral 
to 
the 
semantics 
of 
a 
referring 
term 
than 
the 
identity 
of 
its 
referent? 
Frege’s 
answer 
is 
– 
"its 
sense". 
But 
we’ve 
seen 
that 
Frege’s 
view 
isn’t 
necessary 
to 
explain 
the 
facts 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
explain 
(facts 
relating 
to 
cognitive 
significance). 
We’ve 
also 
seen 
that 
Frege’s 
view 
leads 
to 
an 
incoherent 
conception 
of 
reference 
(reference 
ends 
up 
being 
quantification). 
So 
we 
can 
once 
again 
embrace 
our 
pre-Fregean 
naiveté. 
We 
can 
once 
again 
say: 


(*) 
"Given 
a 
referring 
term, 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
referent 
is 
essential 
to 
the 
semantics 
of 
that 
term." 


The 
difference 
in 
cognitive 
value 
between 
a 
token 
of 
"rhenates 
are 
warm 
blooded" 
and 
"chordates 
are 
warm-blooded" 
is 
given 
an 
explanation 
exactly 
analogous 
to 
that 
previously 
given 
in 
connection 
with 
tokens 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals 
snored" 
and 
"the 
first 
post-maser 
general 
snored." 


A 
qualification 
is 
in 
order 
here. 
I 
myself 
think 
that, 
in 
some 
cases, 
tokens 
of 
"rhenates" 
do 
function 
as 
quantifiers. 
Supose 
you 
say 
"rhenates 
are 
necessarily 
chordates". 
There 
is 
no 
set 
of 
individuals 
A1…An 
such 
that 
you 


are 
saying: 
A1…An 
are 
necessarily 
chordates 
(even 
though 
it 
is 
probably 
true 
that 
they 
are 
necessarily 
chordates). 
You 
are 
saying: 
necessarily, 
for 
any 
x, 
if 
x 
is 
a 
chordate, 
then 
x 
is 
a 
rhenate. 
So 
I 
think 
that, 
in 
some 
cases, 
tokens 
of 
"whales", 
"rhenates", 
and 
the 
like, 
are 
possibly 
quantifiers. 


Let 
us 
sum 
up. 
(*) 
is 
a 
reasonable 
view. 
If 
we 
accept 
(*), 
then 
it 
becomes 
contradictory 
to 
say 
that 
"whale" 
can 
vary 
in 
extension 
(referent, 
basically) 
while 
keeping 
the 
same 
semantics. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
"whale" 
has 
both 
intension 
and 
extension; 
and 
that 
both 
are 
essential. 
We 
accommodate 
all 
of 
this 
by 
distinguishing 
types 
from 
tokens. 
The 
type 
has 
intension 
(a 
function 
from 
worlds 
to 
sets); 
the 
tokens 
have 
extension 
(the 
just 
mentioned 
sets). 
Nothing 
is 
required 
to 
have 
the 
same 
semantics 
while 
having 
different 
referents. 
So 
there 
is 
no 
contradiction; 
and 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
avoid 



contradiction 
by 
adopting 
the 
desperate 
view 
that 
the 
referent 
of 
a 
referring 
term 
is 
irrelevant 
to 
its 
semantics. 
The 
data 
relating 
to 
cognitive 
significance 
are 
easily 
explained: 
we 
need 
only 
take 
into 
account 
the 
differences 
in 
type_semantics 
relating 
to 
(say) 
"rhenates" 
and 
"chordates", 
along 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
token-meaning 
is 
always 
grasped 
by 
way 
of 
knowledge 
of 
type-
semantics. 


§ 
Carnap 
(1947) 
said 
that 
the 
intension 
of 
a 
"sentence" 
(he 
didn’t 
distinguish 
tokens 
from 
types) 
is 
a 
proposition, 
and 
that 
the 
extension 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
a 
truth-value. 


This 
view 
is 
generally 
seen 
as 
either 
true 
or, 
if 
not 
quite 
true, 
then 
very 
reasonable: 
a 
reasonable 
extension 
of 
the 
term 
"extension". 


Carnap’s 
view, 
I 
am 
afraid, 
doesn’t 
deserve 
quite 
such 
a 
warm 
response. 
We 
found 
that 
the 
intension 
of 
"whale" 
is 
a 
property 
of 
the 
corresponding 
type, 
and 
that 
the 
extension 
is 
a 
property 
of 
tokens 
(in 
a 
given 
world). 
Types 
have 
intention; 
tokens 
have 
extension. 


By 
parity 
of 
reasoning, 
sentence-types 
have 
intension; 
sentence-
tokens 
have 
extension. 


The 
intension 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
some 
kind 
of 
function. 
But 
it 
cannot 
be 
a 
function 
from 
worlds 
to 
truth-values, 
for 
the 
reasons 
we’ve 
seen. 
The 
type 
"I 
am 
tired’ 
does 
not 
bear 
any 
proposition; 
so 
it 
cannot 
have 
a 
proposition 
for 
its 
intension. 
The 
same 
must 
be 
true 
of 
the 
type 
"Socrates 
was 
wise". 
If 
we 
assign 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
intension 
to 
the 
type 
"Socrates 
was 
wise", 
we 
end 
up 
committed 
to 
the 
highly 
arbitrary 
view 
that 
sentences 
can 
have 
entirely 
different 
sorts 
of 
things 
for 
the 
intensions: 
some 
have 
propositions 
(functions 
from 
worlds 
to 
truth-values), 
while 
others 
have 
functions 
from 
contexts 
of 
utterance 
to 
truth-values. 


In 
so 
far 
as 
the 
type 
"I 
am 
tired" 
has 
a 
meaning, 
it 
is 
a 
function 
from 
contexts 
of 
utterance 
to 
propositions. 
So 
if 
anything 
is 
its 
intension, 
it 
is 
that 
function. 
If 
anything 
is 
the 
intension 
of 
"Socrates 
was 
wise", 
it 
is 
a 
function 
from 
contexts 
(worlds, 
times 
– 
there 
may 
be 
other 
parameters) 
of 
utterance 
to 
propositions. 


The 
extension 
of 
a 
token 
of 
"I 
am 
tired" 
must 
be 
the 
thing 
that 
the 
intension 
of 
the 
corresponding 
type 
assigns 
to 
that 
token 
– 
just 
as 
the 
extension 
of 
a 
token 
of 
"whale" 
is 
the 
thing 
that 
the 
intension 
of 
the 
corresponding 
type 
assigns 
to 
that 
token. 
So 
the 
extension 
of 
a 
token 
of 
"I 
am 
tired" 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
that 
token. 
Thus, 
the 
extension 
of 
a 
token 
of 



"Socrates 
was 
wise" 
is 
the 
thing 
it 
means 
(roughly, 
the 
proposition 
that 
Socrates 
was 
wise); 
it 
is 
not, 
pace 
Carnap, 
a 
truth-value. 


A 
proposition 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
a 
function 
from 
worlds 
to 
truth-values. 
So, 
at 
least 
arguably, 
the 
extension 
of 
Socrates 
is 
wise 
is 
the 
truth-value 
true 
in 
worlds 
where 
he 
is 
wise, 
and 
the 
truth-value 
false 
in 
worlds 
where 
he 
is 
not. 


But 
the 
extension 
of 
a 
token 
of 
"I 
am 
tired" 
is 
not 
a 
truth-value. 
Its 
extension 
is 
the 
thing 
which 
the 
function 
associated 
with 
the 
corresponding 
type 
assigns 
to 
that 
token. 
That 
thing 
is, 
very 
roughly, 
a 
proposition. 
That 
proposition 
in 
its 
turn 
has 
a 
truth-value. 
But 
the 
truth-value 
is 
not 
the 
thing 
assigned 
to 
that 
token 
by 
the 
corresponding 
type. 
So 
Carnap’s 
view 
is 
simply 
wrong. 


Also, 
I 
don’t 
think 
it 
is 
quite 
correct 
to 
say 
that 
propositions 
have 
extensions. 
Intensions 
and 
extensions 
are 
things 
that 
expressions 
have. 
Propositions 
aren’t 
expressions. 
Strictly 
speaking, 
it 
is 
no 
more 
accurate 
to 
say 
that 
Socrates 
is 
wise 
has 
the 
"extension" 
true 
for 
this 
world 
as 
an 
argument 
than 
it 
is 
to 
say 
that 
"F(x)=2x" 
has 
the 
"extension" 
four 
for 
two 
as 
an 
argument. 


Before 
he 
did 
his 
work 
on 
indexicals, 
Kaplan[81] 
once 
wrote: 


[T]he 
question 
of 
the 
truth 
value 
of 
which 
a 
given 
proposition 
actually 
is 
a 
concept 
and 
the 
individual 
of 
which 
a 
given 
individual 
concept 
actually 
is 
a 
concept 
are…empirical. 
That 
is, 
although 
a 
given 
proposition 
may 
actually 
be 
a 
concept 
of 
Truth, 
there 
are 
usually 
other 
possible 
states 
with 
respect 
to 
which 
it 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
Falsehood. 


A 
proposition 
is 
indeed 
a 
concept. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
a 
world, 
not 
of 
a 
truth-value. 
A 
concept 
of 
Socrates 
is 
some 
concept 
C 
such 
that 
Socrates 
falls 
under 
C. 
x 
is 
a 
greatest 
teacher 
of 
Plato 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
Socrates 
because 
Socrates 
falls 
under 
that 
concept. 
Given 
that 
Socrates 
falls 
under 
that 
concept, 
we 
can 
say 
that 
it 
assigns 
truth 
to 
Socrates. 
A 
concept 
is 
a 
function 
from 
objects 
to 
truth-values. 
x 
is 
a 
greatest 
teacher 
of 
Plato 
is 
not 
a 
concept 
of 
the 
truth-value 
that 
it 
assigns 
to 
Socrates; 
it 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
Socrates. 


If 
a 
proposition 
is 
a 
concept, 
it 
is 
a 
function 
that 
assigns 
truth-values 
to 
objects. 
If 
a 
proposition 
is 
such 
a 
function, 
the 
objects 
in 
question 
are 
worlds. 
Indeed, 
propositions 
are 
often 
analyzed 
as 
functions 
that 
assigns 



truth-values 
to 
worlds. 
Let 
w 
be 
this 
world. 
The 
proposition 
Socrates 
was 
wise 
assigns 
truth 
to 
w. 
Just 
as 
x 
is 
a 
greatest 
teacher 
of 
Plato 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
Socrates, 
not 
of 
the 
truth-value 
that 
it 
assigns 
to 
Socrates, 
so 
Socrates 
was 
wise 
is 
a 
concept 
of 
w, 
not 
of 
the 
truth-value 
that 
it 
assigns 
to 
w. 
Propositions 
are 
concepts 
of 
worlds, 
not 
of 
truth-values. 


When 
we 
make 
it 
clear 
what 
concepts 
are 
– 
functions 
from 
entities 
to 
truth-values 
– 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
tenable 
to 
say 
that 
the 
semantic 
contribution 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
a 
truth-value. 


§ 
This 
brings 
us 
to 
one 
other 
reason 
to 
say 
that 
sentence-tokens 
refer 
to 
their 
meanings, 
not 
their 
truth-values. 
I 
don’t 
think 
this 
reason 
is 
conclusive. 
But 
it 
is 
suggestive. 


The 
content 
of 
the 
type 
"inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
rule 
that 
assigns 
a 
referent 
to 
its 
tokens. 
The 
content 
of 
a 
given 
token 
is 
the 
referent. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
"Plato". 
The 
only 
difference 
is 
that 
semantic 
content 
of 
the 
type 
"Plato" 
is 
a 
constant 
function, 
whereas 
that 
associated 
with 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
is 
a 
variable 
function. 
In 
some 
world, 
tokens 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
refer 
to 
Jefferson. 
In 
all 
worlds, 
tokens 
of 
"Plato" 
refer 
to 
Plato. 
(We 
are 
talking 
about 
worlds 
semantically 
identical 
with 
ours.) 
So 
when 
we 
look 
at 
singular 
terms, 
we 
find 
that 
sense 
(intension) 
is 
identical 
with 
type 
meaning 
and 
referent 
(extension) 
is 
identical 
with 
token 
meaning. 


So 
if 
we 
are 
to 
apply 
the 
sense-reference 
(intension-extension) 
apparatus 
to 
whole 
sentences, 
this 
is 
what 
we 
find. 
Intension 
is 
a 
property 
of 
sentence-types. 
Extension 
is 
a 
property 
of 
sentence-tokens. 
The 
extension 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
the 
thing 
which 
the 
corresponding 
type 
assigns 
to 
it. 
So 
the 
extension 
(referent) 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
its 
meaning. 
The 
referent 
of 
a 
token 
of 
"you" 
is 
the 
thing 
which 
the 
corresponding 
type 
assigns 
to 
that 
token. 
If 
we 
wish 
to 
find 
a 
sentence-level 
analogue 
of 
this, 
it 
is 
clear 
what 
we 
must 
say: 
reference 
is 
a 
property 
of 
sentence-tokens; 
sense 
is 
a 
property 
of 
sentence-types; 
the 
referent 
of 
a 
token 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
the 
meaning 
assigned 
to 
it 
by 
the 
corresponding 
type; 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
corresponding 
type 
is 
a 
rule 
that 
assigns 
a 
meaning 
to 
that 
token. 


Here 
some 
words 
of 
clarification 
are 
in 
order. 
As 
we 
said 
earlier, 
we 
must 
distinguish 
between 
forceless 
sentence-tokens 
and 
forced 
sentence-
tokens. 
I 
believe 
that 
forceless 
sentence 
tokens 
really 
do 
refer 
to 
propositions, 
It 
isn’t 
that 
the 
relation 
of 
such 
expressions 
to 
propositions 
is 
some 
kind 
of 
analogue 
of 
the 
relation 
that 
holds 
between 
tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
and 



Socrates. 
We 
are 
dealing 
with 
an 
identity, 
not 
an 
analogy. 
In 
a 
token 
of 
"if 
snow 
is 
white, 
then 
something 
is 
white", 
the 
occurrence 
of 
"snow 
is 
white" 
really 
does 
refer 
to 
the 
corresponding 
proposition. 


But 
as 
we 
discussed 
earlier, 
I 
think 
that, 
where 
forced 
sentence-
tokens 
are 
concerned, 
we 
are 
only 
dealing 
with 
an 
analogy: 
such 
sentence-
tokens 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
anything. 
(In 
any 
case, 
this 
is 
what 
I 
tend 
to 
believe. 
Later 
I 
will 
state 
some 
reservations.) 
Consider 
a 
forced 
token 
of 
snow 
is 
white. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
argument, 
suppose 
that 
it 
refers 
to 
some 
object 
O. 
Now 
consider 
an 
expression 
that 
uncontroversially 
refers 
to 
O, 
for 
example 
*O* 
or 
(supposing 
that 
O 
alone 
has 
phi) 
*the 
unique 
phi*. 
The 
relation 
between 
that 
token 
of 
"snow 
is 
white" 
to 
O 
will 
be 
different 
from 
the 
relation 
that 
holds 
between 
*O* 
and 
O. 
And 
I 
don’t 
think 
that 
this 
difference 
in 
the 
two 
relations 
is 
merely 
grammatical. 


I 
don’t 
think 
that 
forced 
sentence-tokens 
actually 
refer 
to 
anything. 
When 
we 
consider 
any 
paradigm 
case 
of 
a 
referring 
term, 
we 
find 
that 
it 
can 
occur 
as 
a 
proper 
part 
of 
a 
sentence-token. 
Tokens 
of 
"Socrates" 
can 
occur 
as 
proper 
parts 
of 
sentence-tokens. 
Indeed, 
if 
they 
do 
not 
so 
occur, 
what 
results 
is 
ill-formed. 
There 
are 
cases 
where 
saying 
"Socrates" 
by 
itself 
constitutes 
a 
well-formed 
utterance. 
(This 
would 
be 
the 
case 
if 
you 
said 
"Socrates" 
in 
response 
to 
"who 
was 
the 
greatest 
philosopher 
of 
antiquity?") 
But 
in 
any 
such 
case, 
that 
utterance 
is 
elliptical 
for 
a 
whole 
sentence 
("Socrates 
is 
the 
greatest 
philosopher 
of 
antiquity"). 


A 
forced 
sentence-token 
cannot 
occur 
as 
a 
proper 
part 
of 
another 
sentence. 
This 
suggests 
that 
such 
tokens 
are 
in 
a 
very 
different 
category 
from 
expressions 
that 
we 
know 
to 
refer. 


This 
suggestion 
is 
reinforced 
when 
we 
ask 
what 
it 
is 
for 
an 
expression 
to 
refer. 
This 
is 
what 
we 
found 
before. 
Tokens 
of 
E 
refer 
to 
O 
exactly 
if, 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
"…E…" 
a 
sentence 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
is 
about 
O. 
(Remember 
that, 
in 
our 
judgment, 
"Sally 
met 
a 
man" 
is 
not 
really 
about 
Fred, 
even 
if 
Fred 
is 
the 
man 
whom 
Sally 
met.) 
So 
an 
expression 
refers 
to 
a 
thing 
if 
sentence-tokens 
containing 
that 
expression 
are 
about 
that 
thing. 
And 
E 
is 
an 
expression 
that 
on 
the 
whole 
refers 
to 
O 
iff, 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
the 
form 
"…E…", 
a 
sentence-token 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
has 
O 
as 
a 
constituent 
and 
there 
is 
no 
O* 
(distinct 
from 
O) 
such 
that, 
in 
virtue 
of 
having 
that 
form, 
a 
sentence-token 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
has 
O* 
as 
a 
constituent. 


Given 
this, 
let 
us 
talk 
about 
forced 
sentence-tokens. 
Let 
t 
be 
a 
forced 



sentence-token 
of 
"snow 
is 
white"… 


Summary 


All 
sentences 
of 
natural 
language 
contain 
an 
indexical 
component, 
and 
are 
thus 
in 
the 
same 
category 
as 
the 
type 
"I 
am 
tired". 
Therefore, 
the 
meaning 
or 
intension 
of 
a 
sentence-type 
is 
(approximately) 
a 
function 
from 
contexts 
of 
utterance 
to 
propositions. 
(We 
will 
see 
that 
this 
is 
not 
quite 
accurate.) 
The 
value 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
(approximately) 
a 
proposition. 
So 
sentence-tokens 
have 
propositions 
for 
their 
referents 
or 
extensions. 
They 
don’t 
have 
anything 
for 
their 
intensions. 
Expression-types 
have 
intensions; 
expression-tokens 
have 
extensions. 
Sentence-tokens 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
truth-
values, 
or 
have 
such 
things 
for 
their 
extensions. 
Once 
two-dimensionalism 
is 
accepted, 
it 
becomes 
impossible 
to 
say 
that 
truth-values 
are 
the 
semantic-
values, 
even 
in 
part, 
of 
either 
sentence-tokens 
or 
sentence-types. 
It 
also 
becomes 
impossible 
to 
deny 
that 
propositions 
are, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
the 
semantic 
values 
of 
sentence-tokens. 


The 
Julius-problem 


Consideration 
of 
a 
puzzle 
due 
to 
Kripke 
verifies 
our 
analysis. 
We 
will 
consider 
Kripke’s 
puzzle 
in 
a 
form 
given 
to 
it 
by 
Gareth 
Evans. 


Let 
us 
define 
"Julius" 
thus: 


(J) 
"Julius" 
is 
a 
name 
of 
that 
person, 
whosoever 
it 
was, 
that 
uniquely 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
So 
if 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper, 
then 
"Julius" 
refers 
to 
Smith. 
If 
Jones 
invented 
the 
zipper, 
then 
"Julius" 
refers 
to 
Jones. 
Here 
is 
the 
puzzle. 


(Z) 
"Julius 
invented 
the 
zipper". 
I 
know 
a 
priori, 
says 
Kripke, 
that 
(Z) 
is 
true. 
But 
(Z) 
is 
a 
contingent 
statement. 
Whoever 
Julius 
is, 
it 
is 
surely 
a 
contingent 
that 
he 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
After 
all, 
that 
person 
might 
not 
have 
invented 
the 
zipper; 
he 
might 
have 
died 
at 
the 
age 
of 
five. 
So, 
says 
Kripke, 
I 
have 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
of 
a 
contingent 
matter 
of 
fact. 
This 
is 
a 
puzzle; 
in 
any 
case, 
it 
is 
quite 
a 
shock. 



But 
there 
is 
no 
real 
puzzle 
here. 
We 
have 
to 
distinguish 
sentences 
from 
propositions. 
Kripke 
and 
Evans 
both 
use 
the 
term 
"statement", 
which 
is 
ambiguous 
between 
propositions, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
sentence-tokens, 
on 
the 
other. 


For 
the 
sake 
of 
discussion, 
suppose 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
In 
that 
case, 
(Z) 
semantically 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 


(S) 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
Nobody 
knows 
a 
priori 
that 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
I 
could 
know 
Smith 
for 
forty 
years 
and 
not 
know 
that 
he 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
It 
is 
also 
plain 
that 
(S) 
is 
contingent. 


Given 
only 
my 
knowledge 
of 
English 
and, 
in 
particular, 
of 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 
"Julius", 
I 
know 
that 
(Z) 
is 
true. 
Knowledge 
of 
nothing 
other 
than 
the 
semantic 
rules 
associated 
with 
its 
constituents 
is 
needed 
to 
know 
that 
(Z) 
expresses 
a 
true 
proposition. 
In 
this 
respect, 
(Z) 
is 
unusual 
among 
sentences. 
Most 
sentences 
that 
express 
contingent, 
a 
posteriori 
propositions 
do 
not 
have 
this 
property. 


But 
my 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
for 
(Z) 
is 
quite 
definitely 
a 
posteriori. 
My 
knowledge 
that 
"zipper" 
means 
zipper, 
that 
"invent" 
means 
invent 
is 
a 
posteriori. 


I 
don’t 
know 
a 
priori 
that 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
If 
I 
know 
that 
at 
all, 
I 
know 
it 
a 
posteriori. 
I 
don’t 
know 
a 
priori 
what 
the 
semantic 
rules 
are 
for 
(Z). 
If 
I 
know 
that 
at 
all, 
I 
know 
it 
a 
posteriori. 
Nothing 
here 
is 
known 
a 
priori. 
What 
we 
have 
here 
is 
not 
a 
case 
of 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
of 
a 
contingent 
truth. 


Nonetheless 
there 
is 
a 
still 
a 
puzzle. 
Given 
only 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
for 
(Z), 
we 
seem 
both 
to 
understand 
it 
and 
to 
know 
its 
truth-
value. 
To 
understand 
a 
sentence 
is, 
presumably, 
to 
know 
what 
proposition 
it 
encodes. 
To 
know 
the 
truth-value 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
to 
know 
the 
truth-value 
of 
the 
proposition 
it 
encodes. 
So 
a 
knowledge 
of 
semantic 
rules 
alone 
enables 
one 
to 
know 
a 
matter 
of 
contingent, 
non-linguistic 
fact. 
"With 
the 
stroke 
of 
a 
pen" 
we 
can 
figure 
out 
who 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
By 
the 
same 
sleight 
of 
hand, 
we 
can 
figure 
out 
who 
will 
cure 
AIDS. 
Let 


(Y) 
"Yablo" 
name 
that 
person, 
whoever 
it 
turns 
out 
to 
be, 
who 
discovers 
the 
cure 
for 
AIDS. 

The 
sentence 


(CA) 
"Yablo 
will 
cure 
AIDS" 


expresses 
a 
contingent 
truth. 
But 
given 
only 
a 
knowledge 
of 
semantic 
rules, 
I 
both 
understand, 
and 
know 
the 
truth-value, 
of 
(CA). 
Thus 
a 
knowledge 
of 
semantics 
alone 
enables 
me 
to 
know 
who 
will 
accomplish 
this 
great 
feat. 
But, 
as 
Evans 
said, 
one 
cannot 
generate 
such 
knowledge 
with 
a 
"mere 
stroke 
of 
the 
pen". 


Given 
what 
we 
said 
about 
definite 
descriptions, 
it 
is 
perfectly 
clear 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
puzzle. 
We 
need 
only 
be 
clear 
on 
(i) 
the 
distinction 
between 
type-meaning 
and 
token-meaning; 
and 
(ii) 
what 
it 
is 
for 
an 
expression 
to 
refer 
to 
an 
object. 


To 
say 
that 
"Julius" 
refers 
to 
that 
person, 
whoever 
it 
should 
turn 
out 
to 
be, 
who 
invented 
the 
zipper 
is 
to 
say 
this: 


(JR) 
If 
somebody 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
the 
zipper, 
then 
a 
token 
of 
"… 
Julius…" 
encodes 
the 
proposition:…x… 


If 
there 
is 
no 
such 
person, 
then 
such 
a 
token 
is 
abortive: 
it 
encodes 
no 
proposition. 


Thus, 
the 
semantic 
rule 
for 


(Z) 
"Julius 
invented 
the 
zipper", 
is 
this: 


If 
somebody 
x 
invented 
the 
zipper, 
then 
a 
token 
of 
t 
of 
(Z) 
means: 


x 
invented 
the 
zipper, 


If 
there 
is 
no 
such 
person, 
then 
t 
encodes 
no 
proposition. 


What 
I 
understand 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
sentence-type. 
Given 
some 
particular 
token 
t* 
of 
(Z), 
to 
understand 
that 
token, 
I 
would 
have 
to 
know 
which 
exact 
person 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
To 
understand 
t* 
is 
to 
know, 
specifically, 
which 
proposition 
to 
associate 
with 
it: 
it 
is 
to 
know 
whether 
it 



means 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper 
or 
Jones 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
If 
I 
do 
not 
have 
this 
knowledge, 
then 
I 
don’t 
understand 
that 
token. 
But 
I 
can 
lack 
such 
knowledge 
and 
have 
a 
perfect 
understanding 
of 
the 
corresponding 
sentence-

type. 


I 
cannot 
know 
the 
truth-value 
of 
a 
token 
of 
(Z) 
without 
knowing 
who 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
In 
fact, 
without 
such 
knowledge, 
I 
cannot 
even 
assign 
meaning 
to 
(Z). 
I 
can 
understand 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
corresponding 
type 
without 
such 
knowledge. 
Given 
only 
a 
knowledge 
of 
semantic 
rules, 
I 
know 
that, 
if 
there 
is 
an 
x 
such 
that 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
the 
zipper, 
then 
a 
token 
of 
that 
type 
means: 
x 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
So 
when 
I 
hear 
a 
token 
t 
of 
(Z), 
I 
know 
that 
if 
there 
is 
an 
x 
such 
that 
x 
uniquely 
invented 
the 
zipper, 
then 
t 
means: 
x 
invented 
the 
zipper. 
So 
any 
such 
token 
will 
be 
replete 
with 
cognitive 
significance. 
But 
I 
still 
will 
have 
no 
idea 
what 
its 
literal 
meaning 
is. 


Remember 
that 
sentence-types 
are 
not 
true 
or 
false. 
Sentence-types 
encode, 
not 
propositions, 
but 
functions 
that 
assign 
propositions 
to 
sentence-
tokens. 
So, 
contrary 
to 
what 
Evans 
and 
Kripke 
said, 
given 
any 
expression 
that 
encodes 
a 
contingent 
proposition, 
one 
cannot, 
purely 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
linguistic 
or 
conceptual 
knowledge, 
figure 
out 
what 
its 
truth-value 
is. 
In 
any 
case, 
nothing 
they 
have 
said 
requires 
us 
to 
reject 
this 
view. 
For 
the 
truth-value 
of 
a 
token 
of 
(Z) 
can 
no 
more 
be 
known, 
wholly 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
logical 
and 
semantic 
knowledge, 
than 
can 
the 
truth-value 
of 
a 
token 
of 
"Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper." 
The 
sentence-type 
has 
no 
truth-value 
at 
all. 
So 
under 
no 
circumstances 
does 
purely 
semantic 
knowledge 
yield 
knowledge 
of 
the 
truth-
value 
of 
anything 
non-semantic. 
Puzzle 
dissolved. 


Kripke 
thought 
himself 
to 
have 
shown 
that 
there 
is 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
of 
contingent 
facts. 
We’ve 
seen 
that 
Kripke 
has 
shown 
no 
such 
thing; 
and 
we 
are 
not 
alone 
in 
concluding 
this. 
But 
it 
is 
generally 
accepted 
that 
Kripke 
showed 
there 
to 
be 
analytic, 
a 
posteriori 
sentences. 


There 
is 
some 
truth 
in 
this. 
But 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
what 
that 
truth 
is, 
we 
need 
to 
very 
clear 
about 
the 
difference 
between 
sentence-types 
and 
sentence-
tokens. 


Some 
sentences 
are 
analytic, 
and 
some 
are 
not. 


(T) 
"triangles 
have 
three 
sides". 
is 
analytic. 
What 
does 
this 
mean? 
The 
pre-Kripke 
answer 
was: 



(T) 
encodes 
the 
proposition: 
triangles 
have 
three 
sides. 
Given 
only 
a 
grasp 
of 
that 
proposition, 
one 
can 
know 
whether 
it 
is 
true 
or 
not. 
In 
general, 
a 
sentence 
is 
analytic 
iff 
it 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
P 
such 
that, 
given 
only 
a 
grasp 
of 
P, 
one 
has 
enough 
information 
to 
decide 
the 
truth-value 
of 
P. 
A 
sentence 
is 
analytic 
iff 
it 
encodes 
a 
"conceptually" 
true 
proposition. 
But 
given 
what 
Kripke 
said, 
that 
is 
not 
a 
correct 
analysis. 
Perhaps 
it 
provides 
a 
sufficient 
condition 
for 
analyticity, 
but 
not 
a 
necessary 
one. 
After 
all, 
(Z) 
is 
plausibly 
regarded 
as 
"analytic". 
But 
(Z) 
encodes 
a 
proposition 
that 
is 
not 
"conceptually 
true". 
Smith 
invented 
the 
zipper 
is 
as 
empirical 
as 
can 
be. 


Given 
what 
Kripke 
said, 
the 
concept 
of 
analyticity 
must 
be 
reanalyzed. 
The 
re-analysis 
is 
not 
hard 
to 
produce. 
But 
some 
preliminary 
points 
are 
needed 
to 
forestall 
confusions. 
First 
of 
all, 
semantic 
knowledge 
is 
always 
empirical 
(a 
posteriori). 
The 
only 
way 
to 
know 
that 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
Socrates 
is 
through 
sense-experience. 
"Socrates" 
could 
refer 
to 
anything 
or 
to 
nothing. 


Also, 
a 
sentence 
is 
always 
a 
sentence 
of 
this 
or 
that 
language. 
So 
"triangles 
have 
three 
sides" 
is 
analytic 
in 
English. 


Given 
this, 
there 
is 
an 
obvious 
Kripke-friendly 
analysis 
of 
analyticity: 


(EM) 
Given 
a 
sentence 
S 
belonging 
to 
a 
language 
L, 
S 
is 
analytic 
exactly 
if 
the 
only 
empirical 
knowledge 
needed 
to 
know 
whether 
S 
is 
true 
is 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
of 
L. 


I 
am 
actually 
going 
to 
amend 
(EM). 
But 
first 
let 
me 
give 
the 
raison 
d’être 
for 
it. 
Consider 


(*) 
"12+50=62". 


By 
itself, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantics 
of 
(*) 
will 
not 
enable 
one 
to 
decide 
its 
truth-value. 
One 
has 
to 
know 
whether 
12 
and 
50 
make 
62. 
That 
knowledge 
is 
mathematical, 
not 
semantic. 
But 
the 
only 
empirical 
knowledge 
one 
needs 
to 
know 
the 
truth 
of 
(*) 
is 
the 
knowledge 
that 
"12" 
denotes 
12, 
"=" 
denotes 
equality, 
and 
so 
forth: 
it 
is 
entirely 
linguistic. 
So 
(*) 
is 
analytic 
because 
no 
empirical 
knowledge, 
other 
than 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
that 
give 
it 
meaning, 
is 
needed 
to 
decide 
its 
truth-value. 



So 
(Z) 
is 
analytic 
because, 
given 
only 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
that 
give 
it 
meaning, 
one 
has 
all 
the 
empirical 
knowledge 
needed 
to 
know 
that 
it 
is 
true. 
Of 
course, 
other 
kinds 
of 
knowledge 
– 
a 
certain 
rudimentary 
knowledge 
of 
logic 
– 
is 
needed 
to 
supplement 
that 
empirical 
knowledge, 
if 
one 
is 
to 
know 
that 
(Z) 
is 
true. 
But 
any 
such 
non-semantic 
knowledge 
will 
be 
non-empirical. 


This 
analysis 
fits 
the 
data. 
Consider 
the 
sentence: 


(SOC) 
"Socrates 
is 
named 
‘Socrates’". 


The 
proposition 
that 
(SOC) 
encodes 
is 
entirely 
a 
posteriori. 
Socrates 
might 
not 
have 
been 
named 
"Socrates". 
He 
might 
not 
have 
been 
named 
anything. 
But 
(SOC) 
is 
obviously 
analytic. 
For 
given 
only 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
that 
give 
it 
meaning, 
one 
has 
all 
the 
empirical 
data 
one 
needs 
to 
decide 
its 
truth-value. 
Among 
those 
rules 
is: 
for 
any 
x, 
"Socrates" 
refers 
to 
x 
iff 
x 
is 
identical 
with 
Socrates. 
Once 
one 
knows 
that 
rule, 
and 
a 
few 
others 


(e.g. 
"names" 
denotes 
a 
certain 
relation), 
one 
has 
all 
the 
empirical 
knowledge 
one 
needs 
to 
decide 
the 
truth-value 
of 
(SOC). 
For 
exactly 
similar 
reasons, 
(SW) 
‘there 
is 
a 
language 
L 
such 
that, 
in 
L, 
"snow 
is 
white" 
means: 
snow 
is 
white", 


is 
analytic, 
even 
though 
the 
proposition 
it 
encodes 
is 
a 
posteriori. 
There 
didn’t 
have 
to 
be 
any 
language 
of 
the 
kind 
described. 
"snow 
is 
white" 
might 
have 
been 
meaningless. 


Kaplan 
produced 
many 
examples 
of 
analytic 
sentences 
that 
encode 
a 
posteriori 
propositions, 
for 
example: 


(DS) 
"dthat 
[the 
tallest 
spy] 
is 
a 
spy". 


It 
is 
easy 
to 
verify 
that 
(EM) 
applies 
to 
(DS). 
There 
is 
additional 
confirmation 
for 
(EM): 


(SU) 
" 
‘schnee 
ist 
weiss’ 
means: 
snow 
is 
white" 


is 
not 
analytic. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
our 
analysis. 
Our 
analysis 
says: 
if 
S 
belongs 
to 
L, 
then 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
of 
L 
is 
the 



only 
empirical 
knowledge 
needed 
to 
decide 
the 
truth-value 
of 
S. 
(SU) 
does 
not 
satisfy 
this 
requirement. 
(SU) 
is 
a 
sentence 
of 
English. 
It 
contains 
a 
German 
expression; 
but, 
clearly, 
it 
is 
itself 
an 
English, 
not 
a 
German, 
sentence. 
But 
one 
must 
have 
empirical 
knowledge 
of 
something 
other 
than 
English-semantic 
rules 
to 
decide 
as 
to 
its 
truth-value: 
one 
must 
have 
knowledge 
of 
German 
semantic 
rules. 
So 
our 
analysis 
correctly 
predicts 
that 
(SU) 
is 
non-analytic. 


Nonetheless, 
(EM) 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
modification; 
and 
this 
modification 
undercuts 
the 
importance 
of 
Kripke’s 
discovery. 
For 
reasons 
we 
have 
seen, 
it 
is 
meaningless 
to 
say 
that 
a 
"sentence" 
is 
analytic. 
There 
are 
sentence-tokens, 
and 
sentence-types. 
There 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
"sentence" 
simpliciter. 
It 
is 
meaningless 
to 
say 
that 
(Z) 
is 
analytic. 
One 
must 
say 
either 
that 
tokens 
of 
it 
are 
analytic 
or 
that 
the 
type 
is 
analytic. 


Obviously 
the 
type 
is 
not 
analytic. 
For 
an 
expression 
to 
be 
analytic, 
it 
must 
be 
true 
or 
false. 
A 
sentence-type 
is 
never 
true 
or 
false. 
There 
is 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
a 
token 
of 
(Z) 
is 
analytic. 
Given 
any 
such 
token, 
the 
only 
empirical 
knowledge 
one 
needs 
to 
decide 
its 
truth-value 
is 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
of 
the 
language 
to 
which 
it 
belongs. 
So 
the 
right 
definition 
of 
"analyticity" 
is 
this: 


(EMT) 
Let 
S 
be 
a 
sentence-type 
belonging 
to 
L. 
A 
token 
t 
of 
S 
is 
analytic 
exactly 
if 
the 
only 
empirical 
knowledge 
needed 
to 
decide 
the 
truth-
value 
of 
t 
is 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantic 
rules 
for 
L. 


Given 
a 
token 
t 
of 
(Z) 
or 
(SOC) 
or 
(SU) 
or 
(DS), 
the 
only 
empirical 
knowledge 
one 
needs 
to 
decide 
its 
truth-value 
is 
knowledge 
of 
the 
semantics 
of 
the 
language 
to 
which 
they 
belong. 
(In 
this 
case, 
that 
language 
is 
English, 
plus 
a 
few 
extra 
semantic 
rules 
invented 
by 
philosophers.) 


Chapter 
11 
Are 
all 
terms 
referring 
terms? 


I 
have 
argued 
that 
reference 
is 
semantic 
contribution. 
There 
is 
no 
difference 
between 
referring 
to 
a 
thing 
and 
semantically 
contributing 
it. 
We 
referred 
to 
this 
principle 
as 
SC. 
If 
SC 
is 
right, 
then 
it 
follows 
immediately 
that 
sentence-tokens 
refer 
to 
their 
meanings. 



But 
I 
doubt 
our 
arguments 
for 
SC 
have 
addressed 
everyone’s 


misgivings 
about 
it. 
The 
main 
misgiving, 
I 
think, 
is 
this: 


Maybe 
you’re 
right 
to 
say 
that 
tokens 
of 
"Plato" 
refer 
to 
Plato 
exactly 
if 
Plato 
is 
semantically 
contributed 
by 
such 
tokens. 
So 
in 
some 
cases 
meaning 
collapses 
into 
reference. 
But 
SC 
says 
that 
meaning 
always 
collapses 
into 
reference, 
and 
this 
is 
plainly 
false. 
Consider 
the 
word 
"and". 
This 
word 
has 
meaning. 
But 
surely 
it 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
anything. 
It 
has 
meaning 
by 
virtue 
of 
having 
some 
kind 
of 
syntactic 
or 
formal 
function. 
It 
does 
not 
have 
meaning 
by 
virtue 
of 
picking 
out 
some 
object. 


You 
have 
a 
Neanderthal 
conception 
of 
meaning: 
to 
mean 
is 
to 
denote. 
This 
is 
exactly 
the 
position 
that 
Wittgenstein 
refuted 
in 
both 
the 
Tractatus 
and 
in 
his 
later 
works. 
In 
the 
Tractatus, 
he 
refuted 
it 
in 
connection 
with 
connective 
terms 
like 
"and" 
and 
"or". 
In 
his 
later 
work, 
he 
refuted 
it 
in 
connection 
with 
lexical 
items 
like 
"Nixon" 
and 
"Socrates". 


Semantic 
content 
is 
not 
always 
identical 
with 
reference. 
Expression-
types, 
I 
have 
argued, 
do 
not 
refer 
to 
anything; 
but 
they 
have 
semantic 
contents: 
functions 
of 
some 
kind. 


But 
with 
that 
qualification, 
I 
do 
have 
exactly 
the 
conception 
described. 
Where 
expression-tokens 
are 
concerned, 
to 
mean 
is 
to 
denote. 
When 
we 
say 
that 
some 
expressions 
have 
a 
purely 
"formal" 
or 
"syntactical" 
function, 
we 
are 
really 
saying 
that 
they 
denote 
special 
kinds 
of 
things: 
second-order 
functions, 
to 
be 
precise. 


Consider 
the 
word 
"and". 
The 
standard 
view 
about 
it 
is 
this: 


You 
don’t 
define 
"and" 
by 
pointing 
to 
some 
object 
that 
it 
denotes. 
You 
define 
it 
contextually. 
You 
say 
what 
it 
means 
by 
saying 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
whole 
sentences 
containing 
it. 


The 
idea 
seems 
to 
be 
that 
if 
"and" 
referred 
to 
something, 
you 
could 
define 
it 
non-contextually; 
you 
could 
simply 
indicate 
what 
it 
denoted. 
Since 
it 
must 
be 
defined 
contextually, 
it 
doesn’t 
refer 
to 
anything. 


This 
view 
is 
sheer 
folly. 
For 
"Smith" 
to 
pick 
out 
Smith 
is 
precisely 
for 
"Smith" 
to 
admit 
of 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
contextual 
definition. 
It 
is 
precisely 



for 
"…Smith…" 
to 
mean:…Smith… 


Of 
course, 
"Smith" 
can 
be 
defined 
ostensively, 
whereas 
"and" 
cannot. 
But 
ostensive 
definition 
is 
a 
form 
of 
contextual 
definition. 
When 
you 
say: 


(*) 
That 
person 
is 
named 
"Smith" 


that 
is 
just 
a 
condensed 
way 
of 
giving 
a 
contextual 
definition. 
You 
are 
saying: 


(**) 
Consider 
that 
person 
over 
there. 
Let 
O 
be 
that 
entity. 
"… 
Smith…" 
means:…O… 


This 
can 
be 
shown 
by 
analogues 
of 
arguments 
already 
given. 
Suppose 
you 
point 
to 
some 
object 
O 
and 
you 
say: 


That 
person 
[pointing 
at 
O] 
is 
named 
"Smith". 
But 
if 
you 
want 
to 
make 
a 
statement 
about 
him, 
you 
cannot 
use 
the 
word 
"Smith" 
to 
do 
so. 
"Smith 
smokes" 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
he 
[pointing 
at 
O] 
smokes; 
it 
means 
that 
some 
other 
person 
smokes. 
In 
general 
"…Smith…" 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
he 
[pointing 
at 
O] 
has:…x… 


That 
would 
be 
absurd. 
You 
started 
out 
by 
giving 
an 
ostensive 
definition. 
But 
you 
then 
stripped 
that 
definition 
of 
any 
force 
it 
initially 
had.[82] 
So 
if 
you 
point 
to 
O 
and 
say 
"that 
is 
Smith", 
a 
necessary 
condition 
for 
your 
definition 
to 
have 
any 
force 
is 
that 
"…Smith…" 
mean:….O… 


That 
is 
also 
a 
sufficient 
condition. 
Suppose 
you 
said: 


Sentences 
of 
the 
form 
"…Smith…" 
mean 
that 
that 
person 
[pointing 
to 
O] 
has:…x…But 
"Smith" 
does 
not 
name 
that 
person. 


That 
would 
be 
absurd, 
for 
now 
familiar 
reasons. 


When 
you 
give 
an 
ostensive 
definition, 
you 
are 
really 
giving 
a 
condensed 
contextual 
definition. 


Of 
course, 
pointing 
cannot 
be 
involved 
in 
a 
definition 
of 
"and" 
or 
"or". 
But 
that 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
semantics; 
that 
has 
to 
do 
with 
metaphysics 
and 
epistemology. 
We 
cannot 
point 
to 
abstract 
objects 
or 
to 



objects 
existing 
in 
the 
future. 
But 
we 
can 
refer 
to 
such 
things. 


Perhaps 
we 
must 
define 
"and" 
contextually. 
But 
this 
is 
of 
no 
semantic 
consequence. 
"Smith", 
no 
less 
than 
"and", 
is 
always 
defined 
contextually. 


Strictly 
speaking, 
we 
can 
no 
more 
point 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
"Smith" 
than 
we 
can 
point 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
"and". 
When 
we 
say 
that 
Smith 
is 
the 
meaning 
of 
"Smith", 
we 
are 
really 
making 
a 
statement 
about 
a 
class, 
an 
infinitely 
large 
class, 
of 
expressions. 
Smith’s 
being 
referred 
to 
by 
"Smith" 
– 
Smith’s 
being 
the 
meaning 
of 
"Smith" 
– 
is 
really 
identical 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
sentences 
of 
the 
form 
"…Smith..." 
mean:…Smith…We 
can 
more 
point 
to 
that 
fact 
than 
we 
can 
point 
to 
the 
meaning 
of 
"and". 


The 
other 
side 
of 
the 
coin 
is 
that 
any 
contextual 
definition 
can 
be 
turned 
into 
a 
non-contextual 
or 
denotative 
definition. 
Frege 
rightly 
said 
that 
"some 
man" 
does 
not 
denote 
some 
man. 
He 
concluded 
that 
it 
must 
be 
defined 
contextually: 


(i) 
"…some 
man…" 
is 
true 
exactly 
if: 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
is 
a 
man 
and… 
x… 
This 
is 
what 
people 
typically 
say 
about 
"and" 
and 
case-markers, 
and 
other 
so-called 
non-denoting 
expressions. 
This 
is 
taken 
to 
imply 
that 
such 
expressions 
do 
not 
denote 
anything. 
But 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
convert 
any 
contextual 
definition 
into 
a 
denotative 
definition. 
For 
example, 
(i) 
is 
equivalent 
to: 


(ii) 
For 
any 
concept 
C, 
*C(some 
man)* 
is 
true 
exactly 
if 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
is 
a 
man 
and 
C(x). 
(ii) 
is 
equivalent 
to: 
(iii) 
for 
any 
concept 
C, 
"some 
man" 
assigns 
truth 
to 
C 
exactly 
if 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
is 
a 
man 
and 
Cx. 
(iii) 
is 
equivalent 
to: 
(iv) 
"some 
man" 
denotes 
a 
function 
that 
assigns 
truth 
to 
a 
concept 
C 
exactly 
if, 
for 
some 
x, 
x 
is 
a 
man 
and 
Cx. 

What 
we 
just 
said 
about 
"some 
man" 
can 
be 
done 
with 
any 


expression. 
Any 
contextual 
definition 
can 
be 
reduced 
to 
a 
denotative 
definition. 
If 
an 
expression 
can 
be 
defined 
contextually, 
it 
denotes 
something. 


In 
effect, 
we’ve 
already 
seen 
this. 
Connectives 
like 
"after", 
"and", 
and 
"because" 
denote 
functions. 
The 
same 
thing 
is 
true 
of 
tense-and 
case-
markers. 


Granted, 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
expressions 
like 
"Plato" 
and 
expressions 
like 
"and". 
But 
the 
difference 
is 
not 
that 
the 
former 
denote, 
while 
the 
latter 
do 
not. 
The 
difference 
lies 
in 
what 
they 
denote. 
The 
former 
denote 
individuals. 
The 
latter 
denote 
functions. 


Actually, 
we 
will 
see 
some 
reason 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
difference 
is 
even 
more 
tenuous 
than 
this 
suggests. 
Arguably, 
tokens 
of 
"Plato" 
do 
denote 
functions, 
no 
less 
than 
"and". 
The 
difference 
between 
tokens 
of 
"Plato" 
and 
tokens 
of 
"and" 
lies 
in 
what 
kind 
of 
functions 
they 
denote. 


The 
Augustinian 
conception 
of 
language, 
ridiculed 
by 
Wittgenstein, 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
quite 
right. 


Since 
reference 
reduces 
to 
semantic 
contribution, 
it 
follows 
that 
sentence-tokens 
refer 
to 
what 
they 
semantically 
contribute; 
they 
refer 
to 
what 
they 
mean. 
In 
any 
case, 
if 
one 
is 
to 
escape 
this 
conclusion, 
one 
must 
show 
that 
SC 
is 
wrong. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
possible. 


Is 
it 
a 
truism 
that 
meaning 
is 
compositional? 


Many 
(most 
famously 
Frege) 
have 
maintained 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
meanings 
of 
its 
parts. 
Linguistic 
meaning 
is 
"compositional". 
This 
is 
known 
as 
the 
"thesis 
of 
compositionality" 
or, 
simply, 
"compositionality". 


Compositionality 
has 
been 
accepted 
by 
most, 
but 
not 
all. 
To 
my 
knowledge, 
it 
has 
always 
been 
regarded 
as 
a 
substantive 
thesis. 
I 
think 
that 
compositionality 
is 
correct. 
But 
I 
also 
think 
it 
is 
a 
truism, 
in 
the 
same 
category 
as 
"we 
can 
travel 
in 
time: 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
one 
second 
per 
second". 


We 
have 
argued 
that, 
for 
(tokens 
of) 
"Socrates" 
to 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
just 
is 
for 
sentences 
of 
the 
form 
"…Socrates…" 
to 
have 
a 
certain 
meaning. 
If 
they 
don’t 
have 
that 
meaning, 
then 
"Socrates" 
didn’t 
refer 
to 
Socrates 
to 
begin 
with. 
There 
is 
no 
way 
that 
a 
sentence-token 
could 
not 
be 
a 
function 
of 
the 
meanings 
of 
its 
parts. 
An 
expression 
means 
such 
and 
such 
exactly 
if 
sentences 
containing 
it 
have 
certain 
meanings. 
So 
whatever 
meanings 
those 



sentences 
have, 
that 
fixes 
what 
the 
meaning 
of 
that 
expression 
is. 
Under 
no 
circumstance 
can 
we 
meaningfully, 
let 
alone 
truly, 
say 
that 
E 
means 
O 
but 
that 
"…E…" 
does 
not 
mean:…O…Compositionality 
is 
not 
a 
thesis 
about 
subsentential 
meaning; 
it 
merely 
identifies 
what 
subsentential 
meaning 
is. 


Is 
the 
term 
"direct 
reference" 
a 
pleonasm? 


As 
we 
noted, 
a 
token 
of 
"you", 
addressed 
to 
(say) 
Benjamin 
Franklin, 
semantically 
contributes 
Franklin 
himself, 
and 
not 
a 
concept 
that 
applies 
to 
him. 
This 
is 
also 
true 
of 
tokens 
of 
"Benjamin 
Franklin" 
and 
possibly 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals". 


The 
doctrine 
that 
some 
terms 
contribute 
individuals, 
as 
opposed 
to 
concepts 
applying 
thereto, 
is 
called 
"direct 
reference 
theory". 


But 
really 
"direct 
reference 
theory" 
should 
just 
be 
called 
"reference 
theory". 
If 
tokens 
of 
"the 
inventor 
of 
bifocals" 
contribute 
the 
concept 
inventor 
of 
bifocals, 
as 
opposed 
to 
Franklin, 
then 
they 
would 
not 
refer 
to 
Franklin 
at 
all; 
they 
would 
be 
quantifiers, 
not 
expressions 
that 
referred 
to 
Franklin. 
Reference 
is 
always 
"direct". 


The 
debate 
between 
friends 
and 
foes 
of 
"direct 
reference 
theory" 
is 
really 
a 
debate 
as 
to 
whether 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
reference; 
it 
is 
not 
a 
debate 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
reference. 


Gödel’s 
Slingshot 


According 
to 
Gödel[83], 
the 
Slingshot 
shows 
either 
that 
there 
is 
one 
fact 
or 
that 
Russell’s 
theory 
of 
descriptions 
is 
correct. 
Given 
this 
ugly 
choice, 
Gödel 
rightly 
infers 
that 
Russell’s 
theory 
is 
correct. 


But 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
make 
that 
choice. 
For 
Gödel’s 
Slingshot 
involves 
the 
muddle 
we’ve 
been 
discussing. 


Let 
"Fa" 
and 
"Gb" 
be 
any 
two 
true, 
non-analytic 
sentences. 
Assume 
that 
a 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
b. 
Finally, 
assume 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
referring 
term 
is 
the 
thing 
it 
refers 
to. 


1. 
Fa. 
premise 
2. 
a 
is 
the 
unique 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
[Fx 
and 
x=a]. 
co-refers 
with 
1 
by 

3. 
a 
is 
the 
unique 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
[a 
is 
not 
b 
and 
x=a]. 
co-refers 
with 
1 
by 
LL 
and 
CR 
4. 
a 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
b. 
co-refers 
with 
3 
by 
LL 
5. 
b 
is 
the 
unique 
thing 
y 
such 
that 
[y 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
a 
and 
y=b]. 
co-refers 
with 
4 
by 
LL 


6. 
b 
is 
the 
unique 
thing 
y 
such 
that 
[Gy 
and 
y=b]. 
co-refers 
with 
5 
by 
CR 
7. 
Gb 
co-refers 
with 
6 
by 
LL. 
If 
cogent, 
Gödel’s 
argument 
shows 
that 
either 
definite 
descriptions 
must 
parse 
out, 
in 
the 
way 
described 
by 
Russell’s 
theory, 
or 
that 
any 
two 
true 
sentences 
have 
the 
same 
meaning. 
If 
Russell’s 
theory 
is 
right, 
then 
CR 
cannot 
be 
used 
to 
generate 
the 
needed 
transitions. 
Obviously 
not 
all 
sentences 
have 
the 
same 
meaning. 
So 
Russell’s 
theory 
must 
be 
right. 


There 
are 
two 
major 
problems 
with 
Gödel’s 
argument. 


First, 
that 
argument 
relies 
heavily 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
logically 
equivalent 
sentences 
co-refer. 
This 
assumption 
is 
unwarranted 
– 
it 
appears 
warranted 
only 
when 
S-equivalence 
and 
L-equivalence 
are 
conflated 
--and 
it 
is 
probably 
false. 
So 
Gödel’s 
argument 
fails. 


Let 
us 
discuss 
the 
second 
problem 
with 
Gödel’s 
theory. 
This 
one 
is 
identified 
by 
Barwise 
and 
Perry 
(1983). 
Tokens 
of 
definite 
descriptions 
are 
either 
quantifiers 
or 
they 
are 
terms 
that 
refer 
to 
individuals. 
Let 
us 
consider 
each 
case. 


First 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
tokens 
of 
definite 
descriptions 
refer 
to 
individuals. 
Remember 
what 
we 
established 
earlier: 
if 
two 
terms 
co-refer, 
they 
make 
exactly 
the 
same 
semantic 
contribution. 
The 
following 
two 
expressions 
co-refer: 


(i) 
"a" 
(i) 
"the 
unique 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
[Fx 
and 
x=a]" 
(iii) 
"the 
unique 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
[a 
is 
not 
b 
and 
x=a]." 
So 
they 
both 
contribute 
a 
and 
a 
alone. 
The 
following 
three 
expressions 
all 
co-refer. 


(iv) 
"b" 
(v) 
"the 
unique 
thing 
y 
such 
that 
[y 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
a 
and 
y=b]". 

(vi) 
"the 
unique 
thing 
y 
such 
that 
[Gy 
and 
y=b]." 
So 
they 
all 
contribute 
b 
and 
b 
alone. 
Thus 
Gödel’s 
argument 
becomes: 


1. 
Fa. 
premise 
2. 
a 
is 
a. 
co-refers 
with 
1 
by 
LL 
3. 
a 
is 
a. 
co-refers 
with 
1 
by 
LL 
and 
CR 
4. 
a 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
b. 
co-refers 
with 
3 
by 
LL 
5. 
b 
is 
b. 
co-refers 
with 
4 
by 
LL 
6. 
b 
is 
b. 
co-refers 
with 
5 
by 
CR 
7. 
Gb 
co-refers 
with 
6 
by 
LL. 
But 
this 
is 
an 
obvious 
failure. 
"Fa" 
is 
not 
logically 
equivalent 
with 
"a 
is 
a". 
(Remember 
that 
"Fa" 
is 
non-analytic.) 
So 
even 
if 
logically 
equivalent 
sentences 
did 
co-refer, 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
would 
not 
co-refer. 
For 
the 
same 
reason, 
neither 
would 
(6) 
and 
(7). 
So 
the 
argument 
is 
a 
failure 
if 
definite 
descriptions 
refer 
to 
individuals. 


It 
is 
a 
failure 
if 
they 
don’t 
refer 
to 
individuals. 
If 
they 
don’t 
refer 
to 
individuals, 
they 
are 
quantifiers. 
If 
they 
are 
quantifiers, 
then 
either 
they 
don’t 
refer 
to 
anything 
or 
they 
refer 
to 
functions. 
If 
they 
don’t 
refer 
to 
anything, 
then 
(CR) 
no 
longer 
permits 
the 
steps 
from 
(2) 
to 
(3) 
or 
from 
(5) 
to 
(6). 


If 
definite 
descriptions 
refer 
to 
functions, 
then 
CR 
still 
cannot 
be 
used 
to 
make 
those 
steps. 
If 
they 
refer 
to 
functions, 
then 
"the 
unique 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
[Fx 
and 
x=a]" 
refers 
to 
a 
very 
different 
function 
from 
"the 
unique 
thing 
x 
such 
that 
[a 
is 
not 
b 
and 
x=a]." 
There 
are 
possible 
worlds 
(this 
is 
not 
one 
of 
them) 
where 
English 
is 
spoken 
where 
those 
functions 
assign 
different 
truth-values 
to 
the 
same 
entity. 


On 
any 
reading 
of 
definite 
descriptions, 
Gödel’s 
argument 
fails. 


There 
is 
yet 
another 
reason 
why 
Gödel’s 
argument 
fails. 
Replace 
each 
occurrence 
of 
"the" 
in 
that 
argument 
with 
"ze", 
as 
defined 
earlier. 
Let 
GödelZ 
be 
the 
resulting 
argument. 
GödelZ 
is 
an 
exact 
analogue 
of 
Gödel’s 
original 
argument. 
Nothing 
can 
prove 
that 
"ze 
phi" 
is 
not 
a 
referring 
term; 
for, 
by 
our 
stipulation, 
it 
is 
just 
that. 
But 
if 
GödelZis 
cogent,then 
it 
"proves" 
that 
"ze 
phi" 
doesn’t 
refer. 
If 
GödelZ 
is 
cogent, 
it 
isn’t 
cogent; 
therefore 
it 
isn’t 
cogent. 
Therefore, 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
Gödel’s 
original 
argument.[84] 



Chapter 
12 
The 
semantics 
of 
non-indicatives 


For 
reasons 
just 
discussed, 
the 
meaning 
of 
a 
sentence-token 
is 
in 
part 
a 
proposition. 
So 
part 
of 
what 
a 
sentence-token 
refers 
to 
is 
a 
proposition. 
But 
that 
is 
not 
all 
it 
refers 
to. 
A 
correct 
semantics 
must 
say 
exactly 
what 
a 
sentence-token 
refers 
to. 


Two 
sentence-tokens 
can 
encode 
exactly 
the 
same 
proposition 
but 
differ 
profoundly 
in 
their 
literal 
meanings. 


(i) 
"Plato 
snores" 
is 
true 
or 
false. 


(ii) 
"Does 
Plato 
snore?" 
is 
neither 
true 
nor 
false. 


But 
both 
encode 
exactly 
the 
same 
proposition: 
that 
Plato 
snores. 


Further, 
tokens 
of 


(iii) 
"Plato, 
snore!" 
and 


(iv) 
"that 
Plato 
snores" 
encode 
that 
very 
same 
proposition. 
But 
no 
two 
of 
them 
have 
quite 
the 
same 
literal 
meaning. 


(iv) 
isn’t 
a 
sentence-token 
at 
all. 
It 
doesn’t 
assert, 
order, 
or 
ask 
anything. 
A 
correct 
semantics 
must 
account 
for 
these 
differences 
among 
(i)(
iv). 
We’ve 
identified 
reference 
with 
semantic 
contribution. 
What 
an 



expression-token 
refers 
to 
is 
nothing 
other 
than 
what 
it 
semantically 
contributes 
to 
sentences 
in 
which 
it 
occurs. 


Tokens 
of 
(i) 
are 
assertions; 
they 
have 
indicative 
force. 
Tokens 
of 


(ii) 
are 
commands; 
they 
have 
imperative 
force. 
Tokens 
of 
(iii) 
are 
questions; 
they 
have 
interrogative 
force. 
Tokens 
of 
(iv) 
that 
Plato 
snores 
don’t 
have 
any 
of 
these 
properties. 
So 
tokens 
of 
(i)-(iv) 
all 
contribute 
different 
things. 
If 
our 
analysis 
of 
reference 
is 
correct, 
they 
cannot 
all 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
thing. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
doubt 
that 
at 
least 
part 
of 
what 
is 
semantically 
contributed 
by 
tokens 
of 
(i)-(iv) 
is 
the 
proposition: 
that 
Plato 
snores. 
So 
part 
of 
what 
they 
refer 
to 
is 
that 
proposition. 


Here 
is 
how 
I 
propose 
to 
make 
sense 
of 
all 
this. 


Part 
of 
what 
tokens 
of 
(i)-(iv) 
refer 
to 
is 
the 
proposition: 
that 
Plato 
snores. 
The 
reason 
is 
that 
all 
those 
tokens 
actually 
contain 
the 
expression: 
"that 
Plato 
snores". 
(i)-(iii) 
contain 
it 
in 
a 
phonetically 
disguised 
form. 
Suppose 
somebody 
asks 
you 
"who 
was 
the 
greatest 
philosopher 
of 
antiquity?", 
and 
you 
say 
"Socrates". 
Your 
answer 
contains 
a 
phonetically 
disguised: 
"was 
the 
greatest 
philosopher 
of 
antiquity." 
Similarly, 
(i)-(iii) 
contain 
a 
phonetically 
distorted 
"that 
Plato 
snores". 


But 
(i)-(iii) 
do 
not 
just 
contain 
that 
expression. 
They 
contain 
extra 
semantic 
material. 
In 
each 
case, 
that 
material 
denotes 
a 
function. 
That 
function 
is 
what 
gives 
indicative 
force 
to 
tokens 
of 
(i), 
imperative 
force 
to 
tokens 
of 
(ii), 
and 
so 
on. 
We 
will 
work 
out 
the 
details 
shortly. 


A 
correct 
semantics 
must 
do 
justice 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
"Plato 
snores", 
"does 
Plato 
snore?", 
and 
"Plato, 
snore!" 
are 
all 
members 
of 
the 
same 
basic 
semantic 
category. 
They 
are 
all 
sentences. 
There 
are 
important 
differences 
between 
them. 
This 
puts 
them 
in 
different 
sub-categories. 
But 
there 
is 
some 
one 
non-disjunctive 
category 
that 
comprises 
all 
and 
only 
those 
things 
we 
call 
"sentences". 
A 
correct 
semantics 
must 
find 
the 
property 
had 
by 
all 
and 
only 
the 
things 
in 
that 
category. 


A 
sentence-token, 
I 
will 
argue, 
is 
an 
expression 
that 
denotes 
a 
very 
special 
kind 
of 
function. 
I 
want 
to 
forestall 
a 
couple 
of 
mistaken 
views 
that 
might 
be 
had 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
matters 
just 
described. 
Then 
I 
will 
give 
my 
own 
analysis. 


Differences 
in 
force 
are 
not 
differences 
in 
propositional 
content 



How 
are 
we 
to 
explain 
the 
fact 
that 


(i) 
"Plato 
snores" 
is 
true 
or 
false, 
while 


(ii) 
"that 
Plato 
snores" 
is 
neither? 
How 
are 
we 
to 
explain 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
have 
different 
forces? 


There 
is 
one 
obvious 
answer. 
One 
might 
say 
that 
they 
actually 
do 
contribute 
different 
propositions, 
and 
that 
this 
is 
why 
they 
differ 
in 
force. 
One 
might 
say 
that, 
in 
general, 
differences 
in 
force 
do 
reduce 
to 
differences 
in 
propositional 
content. 
The 
idea 
would 
be 
this: 


(i) 
contributes 
the 
proposition: 
it 
is 
true 
that 
Plato 
snores, 
while 
(ii) 
merely 
contributes 
the 
proposition: 
that 
Plato 
snores. 
This 
is 
why 
(ii) 
is 
neither 
true 
nor 
false, 
while 
(i) 
is 
true 
or 
false. 
A 
difference 
in 
force 
does 
reduce 
to 
difference 
in 
the 
proposition 
contributed. 
But 
that 
is 
absurd. 
Even 
if 
we 
grant 
that 
"Plato 
snores" 
contributes 
the 
proposition 
it 
is 
true 
that 
Plato 
snores, 
as 
opposed 
to 
(merely) 
that 
Plato 
snores, 
that 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
difference 
in 
force 
between 
"Plato 
snores" 
and 
"that 
Plato 
snores". 
For 
the 
expression 
"that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
Plato 
snores" 
is 
neither 
true 
nor 
false. 
But, 
uncontroversially, 
the 
semantic 
contribution 
of 
that 
expression 
is 
the 
proposition: 
that 
it 
is 
true 
that 
Plato 
snores. 
Differences 
in 
force 
are 
not 
reducible

Analogous 
remarks 
apply 
to

and 


(iv) 
"Plato,

What 
we 
just 
said 
(mutatis

shows 
that 
these 
sentence

do 
not

from

A

a

At 
some 
level,

con 
of 
that 
force-operator

the

An

similar 
line

be

The

Surely 
that
