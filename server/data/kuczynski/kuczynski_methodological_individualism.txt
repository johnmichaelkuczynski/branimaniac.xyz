Beyond Methodological Individualism: The Primacy of Collective Psychology in Human Society

John-Michael Kuczynski

Abstract

This article challenges the dominant methodological individualism of contemporary psychology and social science by arguing that collective psychology is biologically primary, with individual psychology being derivative. Drawing on evolutionary psychology, particularly the concept of Dunbar's number and the structure of hunter-gatherer bands, I contend that human psychological architecture evolved primarily to facilitate participation in stable collectives of approximately 150 individuals. Rather than viewing collective behavior as emergent from individual psychology, I propose that individual psychology represents a limiting case of collective functioning. This inversion has profound implications for understanding conformism, deference to custom, corporate intelligence, and the nature of genius itself.

The Failure of Methodological Individualism

Most contemporary psychologists operate on the assumption that group psychology is to be understood in terms of individual psychology. According to this view, individuals possess various self-directed drives that, in group contexts, become diverted from their normal paths and pressed into aims that are not self-directed and therefore alien to the individual. This position maintains descriptive accuracy where very basic drives are concerned—drives relating to immediate threats to survival, crude gratification, and similarly well-defined stimuli.

However, this methodological stance fails to account for three critical phenomena. First, it cannot explain the extraordinarily high degree of conformism exhibited by people to others' opinions, even after accounting for intellectual limitations. Second, even acknowledging people's fear of social ostracism, it cannot explain the deference given by individuals, at the expense of their own gratification, to convention, pre-existing custom, and fleeting but powerful fads. Third, and most tellingly, it cannot account for the fact that corporations, governments, and various collectives embody intelligence that is not reducible to the sum of the intelligence possessed by their individual members.

These observations suggest that collectives are not merely the result of various autonomous individuals pursuing their respective paths. Rather, it appears that the collective is the primary entity, biologically speaking, and there exists an illusion of individual choice and individualism per se.

The Biological Analogy: Cells and Collectives

Consider the biological cell as an instructive analogy. A cell is an individual organism, and one can achieve substantial understanding by analyzing it on its own terms. Approaching cellular behavior through the lens of drives for survival, flourishing, and reproduction yields considerable explanatory power. Yet critical questions remain unanswered and unanswerable from this perspective alone.

Now consider an alternative framework: individual cells attempt to survive, flourish, and reproduce to the extent—but only to the extent—that their doing so is necessary for the collectives they form to survive, flourish, and reproduce. This approach provides at least equal explanatory power and likely surpasses the individualist framework. Cell-individualism can be explained in terms of cell collectivism, but the reverse proves far more difficult.

The parallel to human psychology is direct and profound. Person-individualism can be explained in terms of person-collectivism, but not readily vice versa. Genuine individuals—people who think for themselves, geniuses in other words—can be understood as limiting cases of collectives: as collectives of one, as rogue actors, or most accurately, as members of collectives occupying unusual offices within those collectives, thereby appearing wrongly as external to them. The intense discomfort most people experience when their views conflict with those of their peers reflects not merely fear of social consequences but a biological imperative toward collective harmony.

The converse, however, fails. It proves extraordinarily difficult to explain group behavior—whether mob or organized culture—on the assumption that collectives represent averages of behaviors produced by armies of autonomous, existentialist decision-makers. Outside contexts involving well-defined immediate threats to physical well-being or equally well-defined prospects of crude gratification, people are predisposed to give far more weight, in far more well-defined ways, to existing beliefs and existing institutions than can be explained on individualist assumptions.

The Evolutionary Foundation: Dunbar's Number and the Primal Collective

Robin Dunbar's research on primate social group sizes provides the crucial empirical foundation for understanding collective primacy. Dunbar identified approximately 150 as the cognitive limit for the number of stable social relationships that humans can maintain—a figure derived from the ratio of neocortex size to total brain volume across primate species. This number corresponds remarkably well to the typical size of hunter-gatherer bands, traditional villages, and effective military companies throughout history.

These Dunbar-sized groups of approximately 150 individuals represent the evolutionary cradle of human collective psychology. They constitute the fundamental, biologically hardwired unit. Within these bands, collectivism approaches totality. Conformity, shared knowledge, and deference to custom literally determine survival. Individual identity becomes inseparable from one's position within this group structure. This represents the biological baseline—the primordial form of human social existence.

The radical extension of this framework, however, lies in recognizing how this collectivist psychology scales upward to form modern societies. The same psychological machinery binding the Dunbar-sized band becomes hijacked and scaled to create vastly larger collectives. Through symbols, language, and culture, humans experience the same primal sense of belonging to corporations of 200,000 employees, nations of hundreds of millions, and academic disciplines comprising thousands of members.

These larger collectives constitute what Benedict Anderson termed "imagined communities"—we do not personally know most members, yet we experience collective identity with them. We defer to their customs (corporate policies, national laws, academic conventions) often at great personal cost. This phenomenon represents the "illusion of individualism" operating on a massive, modern stage. One may feel like an autonomous employee of a multinational corporation, but from the collectivist perspective, one functions as a specialized cell within a vast organism.

The "genius" or "individual thinker" appears as a special case within this framework—not as evidence against collective primacy, but as its ultimate expression. Such individuals have so thoroughly internalized the rules and accumulated knowledge of a larger collective (theoretical physics, pure mathematics, musical composition) that they can operate on its behalf as apparently autonomous units. Yet they remain deeply embedded within collective structures, functioning as hyper-specialized organs of their respective disciplines. Einstein did not transcend physics; he embodied it.

Beyond Crowd Psychology: The Village as Baseline

Classical crowd psychology, as developed by Gustave Le Bon and Sigmund Freud, focuses on pathological collective behavior—the riot, the panic, the lynching mob. These thinkers analyzed the temporary breakdown of individual rationality when people aggregate into unstructured masses. Le Bon's "psychological crowd" and Freud's analysis of group psychology both treat collective behavior as a deviation from normal individual functioning, as something requiring explanation precisely because it represents an abnormal state.

This framework fundamentally misconstrues the human condition. Le Bon and Freud pathologized a symptom—the breakdown of normal, stable collective functioning into hysterical, transient mob behavior. They mistook the exception (the riot, the soccer hooliganism, the ransacking mob) for a window into human nature, attempting to construct a general theory from these pathological cases.

The critical distinction lies in recognizing that the "action" in human psychology occurs not in fleeting, pathological mobs but in the quiet, relentless, omnipresent functioning of stable collectives. The relevant collective is not the flash mob looting stores or the soccer crowd rioting—these remain peripheral to normal human existence. The relevant collective is the village, the band, the organized community of substantial scale and temporal stability.

Consider the fundamental contrasts. The transient mob is ephemeral; the village endures across generations. The mob is defined by emotion and loss of control; the village is structured by roles, customs, and tradition. The mob destroys social order; the village constitutes the very foundation of social order. The mob represents a breakdown of individual mind; the village provides the necessary environment for individual minds to form. Classical crowd psychology asks "What goes wrong when people aggregate?" The collectivist position asks "What is right when people aggregate properly?"

When discussing deference to convention, the embodiment of intelligence in corporations, and the power of existing beliefs, we refer not to soccer riots but to village elders settling disputes, craftsmen teaching apprentices, scientists peer-reviewing papers, and employees following corporate procedures. The soccer mob represents the collective experiencing a seizure; the village represents the collective thinking, working, and living.

This distinction reveals why the collectivist framework proves more radical and unsettling than classical crowd psychology. Le Bon warns: "Beware, you might lose yourself in a crowd!"—a caution about temporary danger. The collectivist position asserts: "You were never an isolated self to begin with. You are a manifestation of the village." This is not a warning about exceptional circumstances but a redefinition of the fundamental human condition. The most important collective is not the one you might temporarily join; it is the one that constructed you.

Implications and Applications

Recognizing collective primacy transforms how we understand numerous social phenomena. Corporate behavior cannot be reduced to aggregated individual profit-seeking; corporations exhibit emergent intelligence and values that transcend their individual members. Academic disciplines maintain standards of rigor and accumulate knowledge in ways that individual scholars, however brilliant, could not achieve alone. Traditional customs and conventions, often dismissed as irrational by individualist frameworks, reveal themselves as repositories of collective wisdom tested across generations.

This perspective also illuminates why educational and social reforms predicated on individualist assumptions so frequently fail. Attempts to optimize individual development without recognizing the primacy of collective structures misunderstand the fundamental architecture of human psychology. Individual flourishing occurs not despite but through participation in well-functioning collectives.

The framework further explains the remarkable effectiveness of what might be called "collective intelligence" across domains. Open-source software development, Wikipedia, scientific research communities, and traditional craft guilds all demonstrate how collectives can embody knowledge and maintain standards far exceeding what any individual member possesses. The traditional explanation—that these represent efficient aggregations of individual contributions—fails to capture how thoroughly these collectives shape, constrain, and enable individual cognition within their domains.

Conclusion

The prevailing methodological individualism of contemporary psychology and social science rests on philosophical commitments inherited from Enlightenment liberalism rather than empirical adequacy. The phenomena of conformism, deference to custom, and collective intelligence all point toward collective primacy as the more parsimonious and explanatorily powerful framework.

The biological analogy of cells and organisms, combined with evolutionary evidence from Dunbar's research on optimal group sizes, provides strong support for viewing individual psychology as serving collective functions. The stable band or village of approximately 150 individuals represents the evolutionary environment that shaped human cognitive architecture—not the autonomous individual of liberal political theory.

Inverting the traditional perspective of crowd psychology reveals that stable collectives constitute the baseline human condition rather than pathological departures from individual autonomy. The village constructs the individual, not the individual the village. This recognition demands fundamental revisions to psychological theory, social policy, and our understanding of human nature itself. The collective is not an aggregation of individuals; the individual is a manifestation of the collective.
