Religion vs. Spirituality 

Spirituality is not religion. Savages who exist in a rude pre-civilizational condition are decidedly spiritual—they see the world as populated by spirits and, in some cases, as itself being a spirt of sorts. But they do not have religion. 

A religion is what results when spirituality clashes with rationality-induced doubt. That is why religions tend to have a rational, almost axiomatic structure. The axioms---i.e. the basic precepts of the religion---are often irrational. But they tend to be worked out rather methodically and logically. The reason that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam gave rise to coherent legal codes is that themselves were confluent to some extent with such codes. 

In any case, religion is about doubt; it is about the doubt that the spiritual person has when he is rational enough to question his spirituality but not rational enough to jettison it. 

The reason that religions, such as Judaism and Islam, shun the occult —the reason they forbid it---is that, in a person who is a member of religion-based, and therefore at least partially rational social order, outright spirituality is about the spurning of rationality and it is therefore about psychopathy. It is not psychopathic to be spiritual if one is not rational. But if one is rational one cannot be spiritual without deliberately flouting moral and logical norms---without, in other words, having the flexibility towards truth and morality characteristic of the psychopath.
