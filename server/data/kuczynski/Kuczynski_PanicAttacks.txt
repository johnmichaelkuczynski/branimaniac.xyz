# Positions Extracted from the "Mac" Text on Panic Attacks

## Causal Direction of Panic Attacks

1. Panic attacks are often consequences of inability to perform, not causes of it
2. The claim that inability to work results from panic attacks often inverts the actual causal direction
3. Panic attacks result from inability to do work, not the reverse

## Living a Lie as Source of Panic

4. Living a lie causes panic attacks
5. Living a lie places one in an objectively threatening situation
6. Objectively threatening situations produce panic as a response
7. Panic is a response to genuine objective threat, not imagined threat

## The Neurotic Element

8. Panic attacks can be simultaneously justified by circumstances and neurotic in nature
9. The neurotic element in panic attacks consists in self-deception
10. Self-deception is what makes an otherwise justified panic response neurotic
11. Neurosis involves being unable to consciously acknowledge one's actual situation

## Adaptive vs. Non-Adaptive Responses

12. The adaptive response to being in over one's head is to change one's self-concept
13. Changing self-concept should lead to changing life-course
14. The non-adaptive response is to continue living a lie
15. Acknowledging "this is not what I am cut out for" is a healthy, non-neurotic response
16. Many people in similar situations simply acknowledge their unsuitability and move on
17. Conscious acknowledgment of unsuitability prevents panic attacks
18. One can remain in a disliked situation without panic attacks if one consciously acknowledges the situation
19. Conscious dislike of a situation is distinct from panic about it
20. Conscious negative affect does not produce panic; repressed threat-awareness does

## The Two-Factor Model of Panic

21. Panic attacks result from a confluence of two factors, not one
22. First factor: being seriously in over one's head (objective threat)
23. Second factor: inability to admit that fact without shattering one's self-concept
24. Neither factor alone produces panic attacks
25. Being in over one's head without self-deception produces conscious discomfort, not panic
26. Self-deception without objective threat would not produce panic attacks
27. The combination of real threat plus inability to acknowledge it produces panic

## Self-Concept and Its Role

28. Inflated self-concepts prevent acknowledgment of one's limitations
29. An inflated self-concept can make acknowledging reality psychologically catastrophic
30. The cost of admitting limitation is forfeiting an inflated self-concept
31. People protect inflated self-concepts at the cost of psychological health
32. Self-concept preservation can override rational self-assessment
33. Shattering of self-concept is experienced as worse than the panic itself

## General Theory of Panic Attacks

34. People have panic attacks when actually threatened but unable to admit it
35. The inability to admit threat stems from needing to protect an inflated self-concept
36. Panic attacks signal the presence of both real threat and self-deception about that threat
37. Panic attacks are diagnostic of the combination of genuine danger and denial

## Implications for Understanding Neurosis

38. Neurosis involves being in genuine danger while denying that danger
39. The "neurotic" aspect is not the fear itself but the self-deception surrounding it
40. Neurotic symptoms can be reality-based (response to actual threat) while still being neurotic (involving denial)
41. What makes a response neurotic is not its intensity but its unconscious, self-deceived character
42. A fully conscious response to the same situation would not be neurotic

## Practical Implications

43. Treating panic attacks requires addressing the underlying inability, not just the panic
44. Treating panic attacks requires addressing the self-deception, not just the situation
45. Accurate self-assessment prevents panic attacks
46. Realistic self-concept is prophylactic against panic
47. Leaving an unsuitable situation is healthier than remaining with denial
48. Even staying in an unsuitable situation is manageable if done with full conscious acknowledgment

## On Incompetence and Self-Presentation

49. Some people in demanding positions are genuinely incapable of the work
50. Incapacity can be extreme (below average 5th-grade level in graduate school)
51. Extreme incapacity combined with high-status positioning creates unsustainable situations
52. The gap between self-presentation and actual capacity creates psychological strain
53. Papers that appear to be papers may not actually be papers (form without substance)
