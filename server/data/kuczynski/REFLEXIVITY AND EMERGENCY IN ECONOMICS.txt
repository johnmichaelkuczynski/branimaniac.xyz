WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE ROOT-PROBLEM WITH THE DISCIPLINE OF ECONOMICS IS THE PHENOMENON OF REFLEXIVITY? THAT IS, OF PEOPLE BEING AWARE OF THE DYNAMICS TO WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT AND, ON THAT BASIS, CHANGING THEM, THEREBY STYMING ECONOMIC PREDICTIONS? OR IS THAT MERELY A PROBLEM? 
You said:
The real cancer is the equilibrium worldview:
“Markets converge.”
“Shocks are exogenous.”
“Agents optimize.”
“Systems are stable unless perturbed.” OK...SOUNDS LIKE ECONOMICS TRIES TO TREAT OPEN SYSTEMS AS CLOSED SYTEMS...? But real economies are:

path-dependent EXPLAIN...?
You said:
YES

REMIND ME TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE PHENOMENON OF EMERGENCE IN CONNECTION WITH ECONOMICS; SPECIFCIALLY IN RELATION TO THE POSSIBILITYT THAT--ALTHOUGH ANY DISCIPLINE CAN TOLERATE SOME EMERGENCE FROM THE OBJECTS OF ITS STUDY---A DISCIPLINE CANNOT TOLERATE CONSTANT EMERGENCE
You said:
THIS IS THE REMINDER
You said:
DOES IT RING ANY BELLS? VAGUE, YES. BUT...? I SEE YOU HAVE VALIDATED THIS VAGUE CONCEIT OF MINE, BUT IS IT ANYTHING MORE THAN A SLOGAN?
You said:
HERE IS ANOTHER VERY VERY VERY VAGUE IDEA, AS TO WHOSE MERITS I AM UNDER FEW ILLUSIONS. BUT CONSIDER THIS: IN BIOLOGY, ORGANISMS ARE PRETTY STABLE--THEY CHANBGE, BUT USUALLY WITHIN LIMITS SET BY THEIR BIOLOGIES; IN FACT, MOST (NOT ALL) CHANGES ARE CONSTITUTIVE OF THE SAME. BUT EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY--EVOLUTION--SEEMS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. NOW, WHAT IF ECONOMICS WERE IN THE POSITION OF TREATING SOMETHING INHERENTLY EVOLUTIONARY AND TEHREFORE UNPREDICTABLE AS SOMETHING PREDICTABLE AND STRUCTURE-STATIC?
You said:
OK. TWO BIG CULPRITS: REFLEXIVITY, EMERGENCE....IS THERE A THIRD? 
You said:
RIGHT, THE EQUILIBRIUM (CLOSED SYSTEM) THING. AND BTW 'X IS CLOSED SYSTEM' AND 'X TENDS TOWARDS EQUILIBRIUM' ARE ALMOST ANALYTICALLY EQUIVALENT. BUT WHERE DID THIS ENDOGENEITY THING COME FROM? I MEAN, IN HOLLAND THEY DN'T HAVE MY APPS; SO I GO TO HOLLAND AND CONVINCE THEM TO BUY MY APPS. EXOGENOUS STIMULUS, RIGHT?
You said:
OK, FAIR ENOUGH. BUT MAYBE THERE IS EQUILIBRIUM---JUST NOT 'MONETARY' EQUILIBRIUM. TO USE A VERY CRUDE EXAMPLE: JAPAN IS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM HOW IT WAS 200 YEARS AGO. BUT THEIR NEW TECHNOLOGY ETC. HAS BEEN ABSORBED INTO A REASONABLY WELL-PRESERVED CULTURAL FRAMEWORK....
You said:
"EQUILIBRIUM"--THE SAME AS 'INVARIANTS'?
You said:
OK. SO WHAT ARE THE INVARIANTS (OR THE RELATIVE INVARIANTS) OF SOCIETIES OF SCALE? OR JUST PERIOD?
You said:
ARE THERE ARE ANY STRICTLY ECONOMIC INVARIANTS? MAYBE HIERARCHY COUNTS...
You said:
LOOK, A GIVEN SOCIETY OF SCALE--PICK ANY ONE YOU WANT--IS GOING TO BE PREDICTABLE IN SOME RESPECTS AND UNPREDICTABLE IN OTHERS. HOW PREDICTABLE, HOW NOT PREDICTABLE?
