This distinction explains how sentences with the same truth-conditions can have different meanings.\n   - **Support**: The text uses the example of sentences (a) and (b) to illustrate how different semantic decompositions lead to different meanings despite identical truth-conditions.\n\n4. **Argument 4: All Languages as Formal Languages**\n   - **Explanation**: The text asserts that all languages are formal languages because they can be described by syntactic and semantic rules. Artificial languages become organic when used and learned like natural languages.\n   - **Support**: The text argues that the difficulty in identifying the rules of natural languages like English is due to their richness in formal properties, not a lack thereof.\n\n5. **Argument 5: Natural Languages as Hyper-Formal Languages**\n   - **Explanation**: The text contends that natural languages are hyper-formal due to their intricate semantic structure, which gives them significant expressive power.\n   - **Support**: The text critiques the positivist view that natural languages lack structural integrity, arguing instead that their complexity makes them difficult to describe fully.\n\n### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims\n\n1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Second-Order Semantic Rules**\n   -

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement
1. **Primary Formulation:** A formal language can be identified as an ordered triple (E, G, M), where E is a class of primitive expressions, G is the grammar or syntax, and M is the meaning-function or semantics. All languages, whether formal or natural, are recursively defined expression-classes coupled with a meaning function.
2. **Secondary Formulation:** Non-recursive expression-classes cannot constitute bona fide languages due to their limited expressive capabilities and inability to handle logical relations among their expressions.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis
1. **Argument 1: Definition of Formal Language as an Ordered Triple**
   - **Explanation:** A formal language is defined as an ordered triple (E, G, M), where E represents primitive expressions, G represents the grammar or syntax, and M represents the meaning-function or semantics. This definition provides a structured framework for understanding the components of a language.
2. **Argument 2: Recursive Nature of Grammars**
   - **Explanation:** For languages with non-negligible expressive capabilities, the grammar G is a recursion, meaning it is defined for its own outputs. This recursive nature allows for the generation of new expressions from existing ones, a fundamental property of languages.
3. **Argument 3: Inductive Expression-Classes**
   - **Explanation:** Languages are inductive expression-classes, meaning they can generate new expressions from existing ones through recursive processes. This is exemplified by the ability to form new sentences in natural languages like English using sentential operators.
4. **Argument 4: Necessity of Recursion for Language**
   - **Explanation:** All languages must be recursively defined to be intelligible and capable of generating an infinite set of expressions. Non-recursive expression-classes are limited and cannot function as languages due to their finite nature and inability to handle logical relations.
5. **Argument 5: Meaning-Function and Semantic Decomposition**
   - **Explanation:** A language must include a meaning-function to interpret its expressions. The meaning-function is given by contextual definitions and is essential for understanding the semantic decomposition of expressions.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims
1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Natural Languages as Hyper-Formal Languages**
   - **Explanation:** Natural languages are considered hyper-formal languages because they exhibit the same recursive and semantic properties as formal languages, but with additional complexity and flexibility.
2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Doubly Relative Nature of Linguistic Form**
   - **Explanation:** Linguistic form is doubly relative, meaning it depends on both the syntactic structure and the semantic interpretation, highlighting the interconnectedness of grammar and meaning.
3. **Subsidiary Claim 3: Recursive Definition as Formalization**
   - **Explanation:** Recursive definitions serve as a method of formalization, allowing for the systematic generation and interpretation of expressions within a language.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments
1. **Assumption 1: Universality of Recursion**
   - **Explanation:** The text assumes that recursion is a universal property of all languages, both formal and natural, which is essential for their expressive capabilities.
2. **Assumption 2: Semantic Autonomy**
   - **Explanation:** The text assumes that expressions in a language have a degree of semantic autonomy, meaning their meanings are not entirely dependent on the beliefs of their users, which is necessary for stable linguistic meanings.
3. **Assumption 3: Formal and Natural Language Equivalence**
   - **Explanation:** The text assumes that formal and natural languages share fundamental properties, such as recursion and the need for a meaning-function, allowing for a unified theory of language.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument
1. **Premise 1:** A formal language is an ordered triple (E, G, M).
2. **Premise 2:** The grammar G of a language with non-negligible expressive capabilities is a recursion.
3. **Premise 3:** Languages are inductive expression-classes that can generate new expressions through recursion.
4. **Premise 4:** All languages must be recursively defined to be intelligible and capable of generating an infinite set of expressions.
5. **Premise 5:** A language must include a meaning-function to interpret its expressions.
6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, all languages, whether formal or natural, are recursively defined expression-classes coupled with a meaning function, and non-recursive expression-classes cannot constitute bona fide languages.

   - **Explanation:** The text argues that all languages can be considered formal in the sense of being ordered triples, which consist of a set of expressions, a set of formation rules, and a set of transformation rules. This argument is based on the idea that any language, regardless of its typical description, can be analyzed in terms of these components.

2. **Argument 2: Incoherence of Perfectly Formal Languages**
   - **Explanation:** The text contends that the concept of a perfectly formal language, where the syntax completely determines the logical form of a sentence, is incoherent. This argument is supported by the analogy to a square circle, suggesting that such a language is a logical impossibility.

3. **Argument 3: Coherence of Relatively Formal Languages**
   - **Explanation:** The text proposes that the concept of a relatively formal language, where one language is more formal than another based on the gap between syntactic form and logical form, is coherent.
