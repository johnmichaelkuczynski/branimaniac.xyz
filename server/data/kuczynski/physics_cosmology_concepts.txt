The

is 
not 
to 
detail 
old

only 
new 
concepts, 
to 
choose 
the 
answer 
of 
doubtful 
items,

to 
show 
a 
new 
possible 
way 
of 
study. 
It 
not 
only 
contains 
answers, 
but 
also 
tips, 
probabilities, 
and 
possibilities; 
and 
sometimes, 
only 
ideas 
that 
need 
deeper 
studies, 
or 
even, 
some 
of 
them 
to 
be 
discarded.

Fundamental 
Clarification 


This 
is 
a 
textual 
copy 
of 
my 
manuscript, 
with 
no 
review 
by 
other 
scientists, 
specialized 
in 
specific 
terms; 
nor 
it 
contains 
a 
proper 
review 
from 
experts 
in 
the 
English 
language. 
This 
is 
not 
a 
complete 
theory, 
neither 
it 
has 
only 
proven 
concepts. 
It 
has 
new 
ideas, 
tips, 
possibilities, 
and 
probabilities. 
Besides 
having 
new 
and 
clear 
concepts, 
with 
mathematical 
results; 
it 
has 
some 
ideas 
that 
need 
to 
follow 
a 
deeper 
study, 
while 
it 
has 
others 
that 
will 
need 
to 
be 
changed, 
or 
even 
discarded. 
We 
considered 
that 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
print 
this 
introductory 
book 
right 
now, 
because 
it’s 
better 
to 
consider 
new 
ideas 
in 
physics, 
and 
to 
try 
to 
find 
the 
solutions 
of 
the 
physical 
incongruences 
first, 
before 
developing 
beautiful 
mathematical 
concepts, 
that 
are 
difficult 
to 
apply 
in 
the 
“real” 
world. 
Right 
now, 
we 
prefer 
to 
write 
down 
new 
ideas, 
with 
some 
solutions. 
Other 
solutions 
will 
come 
later. 
We 
hope 
to 
publish 
the 
second 
edition 
in 
the 
near 
future; 
a 
new 
version, 
properly 
reviewed, 
corrected, 
and 
extended. 
Our 
position 
at 
this 
moment 
is 
not 
to 
change 
the 
Physics; 
only, 
to 
try 
to 
change 
the 
minds 
of 
some 
smart 
physicists 
so 
they 
can 
follow 
new 
paths. 
There 
are 
too 
many 
scientists 
researching 
the 
same 
things, 
with 
no 
results. 
The 
acknowledgments 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
next 
edition. 



1. 
Cosmological 
"constant"; 
its 
variability 
The 
cosmological 
constant 
is 
a 
real 
entity. 
It 
existed 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
Universe, 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
exist 
until 
the 
final 
destiny 
of 
itself; 
but 
with 
only 
one, 
crucial 
difference. 
It 
is 
not 
constant; 
it 
is 
variable. 
It 
has 
been 
changing 
continuously 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
time, 
decreasing 
its 
force. 


Although 
its 
force 
increases 
with 
the 
distance, 
that 
is 
only 
true 
in 
a 
specific 
time. 
This 
is 
important 
to 
specify, 
because 
with 
more 
time, 
means 
longer 
space, 
and 
so, 
we 
could 
make 
a 
wrong 
assumption: 
to 
consider 
increasing 
the 
cosmological 
variable 
proportionally 
with 
time. 
As 
we 
said 
before, 
the 
effect 
is 
the 
opposite. 
The 
cosmological 
variable 
is 
not, 
never 
was, 
and 
never 
will 
be, 
zero. 
In 
fact, 
the 
cosmological 
variable 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
“dark 
energy” 
and 
can 
be 
interpreted 
as 
kind 
of 
overall 
energy 
stored 
in 
the 
vacuum 
of 
space, 
and 
hence 
its 
value 
could 
be 
theoretically 
and 
experimentally 
obtained. 
But 
such 
calculations 
and 
measurements 
lead 
to 
an 
enormous 
difference. 
Observations 
show 
that 
the 
cosmological 
variable, 
according 
to 
quantum 
mechanical 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
vacuum 
of 
empty 
space, 
tend 
to 
generate 
a 
nonzero 
cosmological 
constant 
whose 
value 
is 
some 
120 
orders 
of 
magnitude 
larger 
than 
experiments 
show. 
The 
explanation 
about 
this 
colossal 
difference 
is 
simple. 
Quantum 
mechanic 
gravity 
operates 
only 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
(or 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes), 
and 
the 
experimental 
measure 
is 
realized 
in 
present 
time. 
The 
cosmological 
variable 
decreases 
with 
time, 
in 
inverse 
relation 
to 
the 
square 
of 
the 
corresponding 
cosmic 
radius.

≅

times 
This 
explains 
the 
mismatch 
between 
theoretical 
and 
experimental 
results. 



2. 
Formula 
for 
the 
cosmological 
"constant" 
The 
former 
calculation 
was 
correct, 
even 
if 
we 
didn’t 
use 
the 
complete 
formula, 
because 
in 
a 
ratio, 
equal 
quantities 
are 
eliminated. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
cosmological 
variable(the 
actual 
cosmological 
constant 
of 
Physics 
) 
spreads 
in 
six 
directions 
(3 
spatial 
dimension 
x 
2 
ways: 
left–right 
dimension, 
back– 
forth 
dimension, 
and 
up-
down 
dimension). 
Its 
formula 
is 
very 
simple: 


Λ=6/R2 


And 
so, 
we 
can 
mathematically 
obtain 
the 
exact 
value 
of 
the 
cosmological 
variable 
at 
any 
time, 
normally 
approximated 
(the 
formula 
is 
exact, 
but 
the 
result 
is 
an 
approximate, 
since 
we 
don’t 
know 
the 
exact 
age 
of 
the 
Universe). 


ΛPlanck 
Era 
≅ 
2.30 
x1066 
cm-2(Quantum 
Gravity) 
Present 
time 
≅1.5 
x 
10 
10 
years. 
ΛPresent 
time 
≅ 
2.98 
x10-56 
cm-2 


The 
experimental 
value 
of 
the 
Λ 
at 
the 
present 
time 
is 
3 
x 
10-56 
cm-2 
> 
Λ, 
which 
accords 
to 
our 
theoretical 
calculation. 


Experimentally, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
determine 
if 
Λ 
is 
constant 
or 
variable, 
because 
its 
change 
is 
imperceptible 
in 
a 
long 
period 
of 
our 
arithmetical 
time. 
For 
example, 
in 
a 
million 
years 
from 
now, 
the 
cosmological 
variable 
will 
diminish 
in 
approximately 
4 
x 
10-60, 
changing 
only 
its 
60th 
decimal 
place. 


However, 
the 
change 
in 
the 
cosmological 
variable 
was 
enormous 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era. 
The 
definition 
of 
Λ 
describes 
a 
force 
causing 
matter 
to 
go 
apart 
from 
one 
another, 
with 
an 
acceleration 
proportional 
to 
their 
separation 
in 
constant 
time 
and 
independent 
of 
their 
masses. 



3. 
Gravitational 
and 
quantum 
waves 
Any 
particle, 
or 
aggregated 
matter; 
specifically, 
all 
the 
matter 
of 
cosmic 
space 
in 
any 
time, 
or 
the 
matter 
concerning 
any 
Higgs 
field, 
has 
two 
waves: 
one 
quantum 
wave 
and 
one 
gravitational 
wave. 
The 
product 
of 
both 
waves 
is 
always 
equivalent 
to 
the 
square 
of 
Planck 
length. 


λp2=λQW 
. 
λGW 


Because 
Planck 
is 
the 
minimum 
length 
that 
can 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe, 
the 
only 
possible 
way 
in 
which 
both 
waves 
can 
exist 
together 
is 
if 
they 
are 
equal, 
with 
λp 
length 
each. 
This 
was 
only 
true 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
both 
waves 
were 
equivalent. 
When 
a 
wave 
is 
longer, 
the 
other 
would 
have 
to 
be 
shorter 
than 
Planck 
length 
and 
that 
it 
is 
physically 
impossible, 
even 
if 
both 
have 
a 
mathematical 
existence. 
Both 
waves 
act 
totally 
different. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
later. 


The 
First 
Difference: 


Quantum 
waves 
work 
on 
extremely 
small 
scales, 
concerning 
the 
microscopic 
properties 
of 
the 
Universe, 
basically, 
atomic 
and 
subatomic 
scales. 
Gravitational 
waves 
work 
on 
a 
macroscopic 
level. 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
as 
we 
all 
know, 
act 
only 
in 
the 
microscopic 
level. 
Particles 
increase 
in 
energy 
and 
in 
mass, 
when 
their 
wavelength 
is 
shorter. 
In 
cosmic 
space, 
it 
is 
the 
opposite. 
The 
energy 
and 
mass 
increase 
when 
the 
length 
(radius) 
is 
longer. 
In 
that 
way, 
length 
is 
not 
the 
adequate 
frontier 
measurement 
between 
them. 
Instead 
of 
length, 
we 
must 
use 
mass. 



Planck 
mass 
is 
the 
maximum 
for 
the 
quantum 
wave 
(particles), 
but 
it 
is 
minimum 
in 
the 
cosmic 
scale. 
Consider 
MPLANCK= 
±√((h.c)/G)= 
±2.17 
x 
10-5 
g 
(The 
signs 
+ 
and 
-will 
be 
explained 
later 
on.) 
Right 
now, 
we 
can 
arrive 
at 
a 
conclusion: 
both 
waves 
coincide 
only 
at 
Planck 
mass, 
and 
in 
that 
moment, 
the 
4 
forces 
are 
together. 
In 
the 
other 
words, 
particles 
have 
only 
real 
quantum 
waves, 
and 
cosmic 
space 
has 
only 
real 
gravitational 
waves. 



4. 
Respective 
fields 
of 
action 
of 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
and 
gravity 
We 
know 
that 
on 
a 
microscopic 
level, 
the 
Universe 
operates 
in 
ways, 
so 
obscure, 
that 
are 
completely 
different 
to 
familiar 
everyday 
scales. 
The 
formulation 
of 
quantum 
mechanics, 
although 
quantitatively 
successful, 
doesn’t 
apply 
to 
the 
true 
nature 
of 
macroscopic 
reality. 
The 
only 
thing 
we 
know 
with 
certainty 
is 
that 
while 
quantum 
mechanics 
absolutely 
shows 
us 
that 
a 
number 
of 
basic 
concepts 
essential 
to 
our 
understanding 
of 
the 
microscopic 
world, 
they 
fail 
to 
have 
any 
meaning 
in 
the 
macroscopic 
world. 
Although 
it 
is 
mathematically 
exact 
when 
our 
focus 
leads 
on 
the 
microscopic 
realm. 
The 
quantum 
mechanics 
framework 
applies 
the 
particles 
or 
fields 
with 
mass 
less 
than 
Planck 
mass. 
(Approx. 
2.17 
x 
10-5 
g 
or 
1.2 
x 
1019 
GeV) 
The 
gravitational 
framework 
applies 
to 
matter 
or 
fields 
with 
a 
mass 
equal 
or 
heavier 
than 
Planck 
mass. 
Both 
frameworks 
apply 
at 
the 
same 
time 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
the 
Universe 
had 
the 
minimum 
mass 
and 
the 
first 
Higgs 
field 
had 
the 
maximum 
mass. 
It 
was 
the 
moment 
of 
equivalent 
waves. 
They 
also 
apply 
in 
the 
co–singularity 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes. 
Quantum 
effects 
act 
on 
the 
gravitational 
waves 
too, 
but 
in 
a 
different 
way 
that 
we 
will 
explain 
later. 
Particles, 
their 
fields, 
and 
the 
three 
GUT 
forces 
have 
real 
quantum 
waves. 
Aggregated 
matter, 
cosmic 
space, 
and 
the 
gravitational 
force 
have 
real 
gravitational 
waves 
and 
a 
virtual 
quantum 
wave. 
No 
particle 
has 
a 
real 
gravitational 
wave, 
not 
even 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
since 
Planck 
mass, 
when 
both 
waves 
are 
real, 
is 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
field, 
not 
of 
the 
particles. 
The 
heaviest 
particle 
is 
lighter, 
approximately 
4.33 
x 
10-6 
g 
or 
2.4 
x 
1018 
GeV 
(equivalent 
to 
Planck 
mass 
÷ 
√(8π)). 
However, 
some 
gravitational 
effects 
exist 
around 
this 
point. 



5. 
Space 
as 
the 
fundamental 
measure 
of 
the 
Universe 
The 
fundamental 
unity 
of 
measurements 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
space. 
All 
the 
other 
measures 
are 
derived 
from 
it. 
Space 
exists 
even 
if 
matter 
doesn’t 
exist. 
The 
initial 
Big 
Bang, 
or 
better 
said, 
our 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
is 
simply 
space; 
in 
three 
dimensions 
of 
the 
same 
size. 
The 
other 
constants 
and 
variables, 
including 
time, 
came 
later. 
Space 
zero 
or 
time 
zero 
is 
to 
be 
mistaken, 
at 
least, 
from 
a 
physical 
point 
of 
view. 
At 
the 
“beginning”, 
the 
dimensions 
of 
space 
were 
Planck 
length, 
approximately 


1.616 
x 
10-33 
cm 
each. 
Sub-Planck 
distances 
do 
not 
have 
a 
physical 
existence 
and 
they 
are 
impossible 
to 
reach, 
even 
using 
the 
best 
technological 
equipment 
possible 
in 
the 
future. 
Zero 
space 
is 
an 
absurd 
concept 
and 
it 
is 
the 
main 
cause 
why 
ridiculous 
results, 
“singularities” 
or 
“infinities”, 
exist 
in 
mathematical 
calculations. 
Besides 
that, 
it 
is 
on 
sub-Planck 
distance 
scales 
that 
we 
encounter 
the 
fundamental 
incompatibility 
between 
General 
Relativity 
and 
Quantum 
mechanics. 
The 
notion 
of 
a 
smooth 
spatial 
geometry, 
the 
central 
principle 
of 
General 
Relativity, 
cannot 
be 
destroyed 
by 
the 
violent 
fluctuations 
of 
the 
quantum 
world 
on 
ultramicroscopic 
scales, 
because 
sub-
Planck 
scales 
don’t 
exist. 
In 
brief, 
we 
can 
say: 
Planck 
distance 
is 
the 
minimum 
length, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
only 
distance 
(and 
its 
corresponding 
mass) 
when 
gravity 
has 
quantum 
mechanical 
effects. 
After 
the 
first 
chronos, 
quantum 
mechanics 
and 
general 
relativity 
(quantum 
and 
gravitational 
waves) 
took 
separate 
ways. 
Zero 
space 
and 
zero 
time 
don’t 
exist 
physically. 
In 
first 
place, 
nature 
(or 
physical 
reality) 
“lives” 
in 
a 
logarithmic 
space-time, 
where 
zero, 
and 
its 
counterpart 
∞, 
are 
outside 
of 
our 
physical 
reality, 
or 
even 
on 
any 
physical 
existence. 
Log 
0 
and 
ln 
0 
produce 
error 
answers, 
but 
its 
existence 
is 
real 
in 
100 
or 
e0. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
formula 
to 
get 
the 
initial 
space 
needs 
to 
use 
ex, 
where 
x 
is 
a 
complex 
term, 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
derived. 
So, 
space 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist, 
but 
what 
about 
time 
zero? 



6. 
Quantum 
Cosmological. 
Existence 
of 
time 
The 
question 
about 
time, 
is 
not 
based 
in 
if 
the 
Universe 
had 
a 
beginning 
or 
if 
it 
will 
exist 
forever. 
Of 
course, 
if 
time 
exists, 
there 
is 
a 
beginning, 
because 
the 
eternal 
entity 
has 
no 
time. 
The 
assumption 
could 
be 
that 
time 
began 
when 
the 
Universe 
began, 
but 
that 
is 
not 
correct. 
Before 
the 
first 
Big 
Bang 
(we 
will 
explain 
later 
what 
we 
mean 
with 
'first'), 
the 
Universe 
didn’t 
exist, 
or 
in 
other 
terms, 
it 
was 
a 
vacuum 
without 
limits. 
It 
was 
absolute, 
zero 
or 
infinite 
space– 
time. 
(The 
complement 
of 
zero 
whole 
is 
the 
infinite 
whole). 
Or 
the 
complement 
of 
the 
universal 
whole 
is 
the 
vacuum 
whole. 
This 
is 
a 
metaphysical 
or 
esoteric 
condition, 
outside 
of 
the 
physical 
existence. 
The 
initial 
appearance 
of 
the 
Universe 
changed 
its 
condition 
of 
without 
limits, 
to 
a 
condition 
of 
“vacuum 
with 
limits”. 
And 
in 
that 
moment, 
the 
Universe 
began, 
because 
space 
began. 
The 
essence 
of 
that 
limit 
is 
movement; 
but 
at 
the 
beginning, 
there 
was 
no 
movement, 
only 
a 
tendency 
to 
it. 
With 
no 
movement, 
velocity 
didn’t 
exist 
and 
so, 
time 
didn’t 
exist. 
What 
happened 
with 
the 
beginning 
of 
time? 
When 
exactly 
was 
it? 
Einstein 
said, 
in 
a 
correct 
way, 
that 
space 
and 
time 
are 
not 
two 
separate 
entities, 
both 
of 
them 
are 
united 
(forming 
space-time). 
But 
they 
show 
themselves 
as 
two 
different 
entities, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
so 
at 
the 
beginning. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
as 
well 
as 
at 
the 
last 
moment 
of 
our 
Universe, 
space–time 
was 
and 
will 
be 
a 
compact 
structure, 
in 
a 
way 
where 
both 
of 
them 
have 
a 
similar 
appearance, 
and 
where 
they 
meld 
together. 
The 
Minkowski 
principle 
(adapted 
by 
Einstein 
in 
his 
theories), 
is 
not 
only 
a 
mathematical 
artifact, 
where 
time 
is 
negative 
space, 
but 
a 
reality, 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
cycle 
of 
any 
Universe, 
it 
which 
we 
will 
explain 
later, 
and 
use 
in 
our 
formulas, 
in 
order 
to 
see 
the 
real 
effect 
it 
has 
in 
all 
of 
the 
cycles 
of 
the 
different 
dimensional 
Universes, 
including 
ours. 
In 
other 
words, 
this 
is 
essential, 
at 
least 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
at 
the 
final 
steps 
of 
any 
Universe. 


Vanished 
time 
is 
the 
essential 
effect 
of 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
“Quantum 
Mechanics” 
applied 
to 
a 
gravitational 
wave, 
or 
macroscopic 
scale, 
that 
some 
call 
“Quantum 
Cosmological”. 
We 
can 
say 
that, 
if 
in 
normal 
quantum 



mechanics 
of 
the 
quantum 
wave, 
or 
atomic 
and 
subatomic 
scales, 
the 
uncertainty 
principle 
is 
essential; 
in 
quantum 
cosmological, 
macroscopic 
scale, 
vanished 
time 
is 
essential 
in 
the 
beginning 
and 
in 
the 
final 
steps 
of 
any 
Universe. 
If 
this 
principle 
wouldn’t 
exist, 
our 
Universe 
wouldn’t 
exist 
either. 
“Quantum 
Cosmology” 
vanished 
time 
at 
the 
extreme 
limits 
of 
the 
Universe, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
in 
those 
moments, 
time 
is 
simply 
meaningless. 
We 
can 
say, 
with 
complete 
security, 
that 
in 
the 
beginning, 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
close 
to 
it, 
time 
did 
not 
exist. 
And 
at 
a 
similar 
condition, 
it 
will 
not 
exist 
in 
the 
final 
steps 
of 
our 
Universe 
or 
close 
to 
it. 
What 
happened 
with 
time 
in 
those 
extreme 
events? 
It 
was 
converted 
or 
(will 
be 
converted) 
into 
space, 
or 
in 
other 
words; 
was 
(or 
will 
be) 
completely 
amalgamated 
with 
space 
into 
a 
single 
entity. 
Quantitative 
effects 
of 
this 
transformation 
(time 
to 
space), 
will 
be 
explained 
later. 



7. 
Chronos, 
minimum 
unit 
of 
time 
With 
this 
position, 
time 
zero 
didn’t 
exist, 
even 
if 
it 
had 
a 
beginning. 
If 
the 
minimum 
length 
is 
Planck 
length 
(1.616 
x 
10-33 
cm); 
the 
minimum 
time, 
is 
λp/c, 
or 
chronos, 
and 
it's 
equivalent 
to 
5.4 
x 
10-44 
s, 
approximately. 
Some 
can 
imagine 
a 
sequence, 
where 
time 
starts 
as 
space 
and 
gradually 
acquired 
its 
own 
quality, 
and 
became 
time; 
or 
say 
that, 
what 
we 
know 
like 
time, 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
at 
the 
end, 
had 
properties 
we 
normally 
associate 
with 
space; 
or 
use 
any 
other 
different 
words. 
The 
essential 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
singular 
origin 
of 
time. 
Time 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist. 
The 
statement 
that 
time 
“emerges” 
gradually 
from 
space 
are 
not 
only 
convenient 
words, 
but 
they 
are 
the 
essential 
to 
quantum 
cosmological 
effects. 
This 
is 
completely 
needed, 
not 
only 
in 
how 
the 
Universe 
came 
into 
existence, 
but 
moreover, 
without 
this 
effect, 
any 
Universe 
would 
not 
come 
to 
existence. 
The 
mechanism 
of 
this 
effect 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
explain, 
and 
we 
will 
show 
this; 
in 
addition 
to 
that, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
former, 
present 
(ours), 
and 
future 
Universes. 


The 
appearance 
of 
the 
Universe 
was 
the 
first 
event, 
but 
not 
a 
first 
moment. 


Since 
Planck 
length 
is 
the 
minimum 
length, 
a 
complete 
continuity 
of 
time 
is 
impossible. 
Minimum 
time 
is 
exactly 
λp/c=5.39032875 
x 
10-44 
s. 
If 
experiments 
can´t 
prove 
the 
temporal 
discontinuity 
yet, 
is 
because 
“chronos” 
of 
time 
are 
pretty 
brief. 
Theories 
involving 
“chronos” 
have 
been 
proposed 
mainly 
by 
David 
Finkelstein, 
and 
his 
position 
is 
correct, 
because 
time 
can 
not 
be 
continuous. 
Chronos 
would 
be 
like 
the 
“atoms 
of 
time.” 



8. 
Planck 
length 
as 
minimum 
length 
and 
its 
inverse 
Planck 
length 
is 
the 
minimum 
length 
(minimum 
limit), 
and 
according 
to 
T-
Symmetry, 
it 
has 
an 
inverse, 
corresponding 
maximum, 
approximately 
1/λp. 
That 
way, 
when 
the 
minimum 
is 
shorter, 
the 
maximum 
is 
(or 
will 
be) 
longer. 
According 
to 
this 
position, 
the 
only 
way 
for 
the 
destiny 
of 
the 
Universe 
to 
be 
infinite 
is 
that 
if 
it 
was 
zero 
at 
the 
beginning. 
Both 
of 
them, 
∞ 
and 
0, 
are 
physically 
wrong. 
We 
can 
call 
Planck 
length, 
minimum 
or 
cozero; 
and 
maximum 
length, 
cofinity. 
Zero 
has 
a 
mathematical 
existence 
but 
it 
has 
not 
a 
physical 
one. 
When 
a 
quantity 
exists, 
even 
if 
it 
continuously 
decreases, 
it 
will 
never 
reach 
zero. 
If 
in 
any 
physical 
concept, 
we 
change 
zero 
size 
to 
cozero 
size, 
and 
infinite 
to 
cofinite, 
we 
can 
avoid 
the 
wrong 
results 
of 
the 
conventional 
theories. 
The 
String 
theory, 
although 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
modified, 
correctly 
proclaims 
that 
the 
Universe 
cannot 
be 
squeezed 
to 
a 
size 
shorter 
than 
Planck 
length 
in 
any 
of 
its 
spatial 
dimensions. 
However, 
even 
with 
the 
Big 
Bang 
having 
a 
minimum 
size 
(and 
for 
that 
reason 
the 
Universe 
will 
never 
be 
totally 
flat), 
physicists 
still 
have 
doubt 
if 
the 
Universe 
is 
flat, 
elliptical, 
parabolic, 
or 
hyperbolic; 
and 
in 
all 
of 
those 
possibilities, 
they 
don’t 
know 
if 
it 
will 
expand 
forever, 
or 
if 
the 
expansion 
will 
stop 
and 
reverse 
(Big 
Crunch). 
Despite 
the 
experimental 
observations 
and 
mathematical 
calculations 
that 
show 
that 
the 
Universe 
will 
expand 
forever, 
it 
will 
contract. 
This 
paradox 
has 
a 
solution, 
that 
we 
will 
explain 
later. 


Right 
now, 
we 
can 
put 
the 
two 
limits: 


➢ 
Minimum 
length 
(Planck, 
minimum 
or 
cozero) 
Exactly=1.615979906 
x 
10-33 
cm 
➢ 
Maximum 
Length 
(Maximum 
or 
cofinity) 
Approximately 
1/λp 
≅6.1882 
x1032 
cm 
T-symmetry 
is 
exactly 
(α.1)/λp 
in 
cm, 
where 
the 
units 
of 
α 
are 
in 
cm2, 
so 
the 
maximum 
length 
is 
around 
1032 
cm, 
but 
we 
need 
to 
use 
a 
spatial 
correction 
factor. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
e-0.75, 
or 
1/e0.75. 
We 
need 
to 
multiply 
by 
0.472366552, 
or 
divide 
by 
2.117000017. 



The 
origin 
of 
this 
factor 
will 
be 
explained 
later. 
The 
maximum 
length 
of 
our 
Universe 
will 
be 
exactly, 
2.923096699 
x 
1032 
cm. 
And 
so, 
the 
time 
our 
Universe 
will 
close, 
will 
be 
9.750401051 
x1021 
s, 
which 
we 
call 
"period". 
After 
this 
time, 
our 
Universe 
(and 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter), 
including 
all 
the 
stables 
particles 
and 
the 
black 
holes, 
will 
be 
destroyed, 
in 
an 
enormous 
and 
colossal 
Big 
Crush 
(not 
Big 
Crunch), 
that 
we 
will 
explain 
later. 



9. 
Modulus 
with 
minimum 
limits 
and 
maximum 
limits 
The 
former 
calculations 
are 
only 
true 
to 
our 
Universe 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
one 
time 
dimension. 
Besides, 
we 
need 
to 
explain 
8 
essential 
concepts: 


a) 
In 
any 
Universe 
with 
several 
spatial 
dimensions, 
all 
the 
dimensions 
have 
exactly 
the 
same 
minimum 
length 
in 
the 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
If 
there 
would 
be 
any 
difference 
among 
them, 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
destroyed, 
or 
collapse 
upon 
itself. 
b) 
Any 
Universe 
with 
different 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions, 
has 
a 
different 
Planck 
length, 
and 
consequently 
a 
different 
maximum 
length. 
The 
formula 
is 
similar, 
but 
it 
uses 
"n", 
equivalent 
in 
each 
case 
to 
the 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions. 
c) 
Space 
is 
no 
matter, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
minimum 
length 
always 
exists, 
even 
if 
the 
dimensions 
are 
developed. 
To 
subtract 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
from 
the 
dimensional 
modulus 
is 
a 
mistake. 
If 
dimensions 
of 
space 
are 
10, 
the 
“Calabi-Yau” 
form 
must 
be 
10 
and 
not 
6, 
even 
if 
4 
of 
them 
are 
developed. 
Space 
is 
a 
limit 
and 
limit 
exists, 
with 
or 
without 
matter; 
with 
or 
without 
extended 
dimensions. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
there 
exists 
an 
abstract 
maximum 
modulus 
as 
a 
counterpart 
to 
the 
minimum 
limit 
modulus, 
with 
the 
same 
number 
of 
dimensions 
that 
remain 
as 
maximum 
limits, 
even 
if 
it 
doesn’t 
have 
any 
developed 
dimensions. 
Matter 
will 
reach 
them 
eventually. 
We 
know 
4 
dimensions 
are 
developed 
right 
now 
(3 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time); 
but 
considering 
10 
to 
be 
the 
dimensions 
of 
space, 
the 
relation 
would 
not 
be 
6 
curled 
and 
4 
extended, 
but 
10 
minimum, 
4 
extended 
and 
10 
maximum. 
Just 
as 
in 
quantum 
mechanics, 
Special, 
and 
General 
theory 
of 
Relativity; 
when 
we 
talk 
about 
space, 
and 
specially 
about 
“abstract 
space”, 
we 
require 
dramatic 
changes 
in 
our 
form 
of 
thinking, 
and 
a 
drastic 
revision 
of 
our 
concepts. 
There 
are 
enormous 
differences 
between 
matter 
and 
space. 
A 
curled 
limit? 
A 
limit 
disappearing 
because 
it 
is 
extending? 
Heat 
destroying 
abstract 
space?, 
etc. 
Definitively 
there 
is 
much 
knowledge, 

but 
we 
need 
more 
imagination 
and 
a 
change 
to 
our 
normal 
reasoning. 


d) 
It 
is 
supposed 
that 
space 
has 
10 
dimensions; 
but 
it 
has 
only 
8 
(7 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
1 
time 
dimension). 
Seven 
dimensions 
is 
not 
an 
esoteric 
idea, 
it 
is 
a 
physical 
reality 
that 
we 
will 
explain 
further 
on. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
mathematical 
sequence 
would 
be: 
8 
maximum-4 
extended-8 
minimum 
and 
not 
4 
extended-4 
curled. 
e) 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
draw 
all 
the 
8 
dimensions 
of 
the 
minimum 
modulus 
of 
space 
in 
an 
arithmetical 
form. 
They 
have 
different 
lengths 
and 
the 
difference 
is 
around 
1010 
times 
a 
dimension 
to 
the 
next. 
We 
need 
to 
use 
logarithmical 
scales, 
preferably 
natural 
logarithms 
(ln). 
f) 
Using 
logarithmic 
scale, 
we 
can 
even 
draw 
the 
modulus 
of 
maximum 
limits. 
Both 
moduli 
are 
inverse. 
In 
“Planck 
modulus”, 
fewer 
dimensions 
means 
longer 
length. 
In 
the 
maximum 
modulus, 
more 
dimensions 
means 
longer 
length. 
g) 
It 
is 
a 
mistake 
to 
count 
the 
dimensions 
one 
by 
one, 
because 
the 
dimensions 
are 
different 
among 
Universes. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
we 
have 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
of 
the 
same 
length: 
one, 
two 
and 
three; 
but 
they 
are 
different 
to 
the 
dimensions 
of 
one 
or 
two 
dimensional 
Universes. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
is 
not 
7, 
but 
28 
spatial 
dimensions, 
equivalent 
to 
0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. 
The 
time 
dimension 
is 
also 
space 
(-1), 
because 
time 
is 
negative 
space. 
That 
is 
a 
quantum 
cosmological 
effect. 
This 
is 
fundamental, 
especially 
in 
the 
Universe 
with 
1 
space-time 
dimension 
(zero 
spatial 
dimension 
+ 
time). 
It 
was 
the 
first 
Big 
Bang. 
h) 
The 
way 
to 
draw 
the 
moduli 
(Planck 
and 
Maximum) 
depends 
on 
the 
system 
chosen. 
We 
will 
draw 
different 
forms 
later, 
and 
will 
explain 
the 
concepts 
and 
the 
mathematical 
sense 
used 
in 
each. 

10. 
Abstract 
space 
as 
the 
original 
entity 
produced. 
Pre 
Big 
Bang 
As 
we 
wrote 
before, 
the 
different 
concepts 
of 
space 
and 
matter, 
like 
quantum 
mechanics, 
special, 
and 
general 
relativity, 
require 
us 
to 
open 
our 
minds 
and 
to 
change 
dramatically 
our 
point 
of 
view. 
Space 
is 
not 
matter. 
The 
material 
conditions, 
forces, 
mass, 
energy, 
and 
in 
general, 
every 
constant 
and 
variable, 
is 
derived 
from 
it; 
and 
not, 
in 
the 
inverse 
way. 
For 
example: 
gravity 
is 
not 
derived 
from 
entropy, 
both 
of 
them 
are 
derived 
from 
space. 
Is 
the 
same 
thing, 
like: 
salted 
or 
salty. 
No 
one 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
other 
one. 
Both 
of 
them 
are 
derived 
from 
salt. 


In 
that 
way, 
abstract 
space 
is 
the 
original 
entity 
produced. 
It 
is 
only 
limits. 
For 
example, 
space 
exists 
with 
matter 
or 
without 
matter, 
but 
matter 
can 
not 
exist 
without 
space. 
When 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
abstract 
space, 
we 
are 
referring 
to 
the 
primordial 
space, 
existing 
alone, 
with 
no 
matter 
in 
existence 
yet. 
When 
matter 
appears, 
fundamental 
constants 
appear 
(G, 
c, 
ℏ). 
A 
relationship 
exits 
between 
normal 
space 
(named 
simply 
space) 
and 
matter. 
In 
short, 
not 
only 
can 
space 
stretch 
and 
shrink, 
it 
can 
be 
bent 
and 
distorted. 
One 
of 
the 
best 
physicists 
in 
the 
history 
of 
Humanity, 
John 
Wheeler, 
many 
times 
said, 
describing 
gravity. 
“Mass 
grips 
space 
by 
telling 
it 
how 
to 
curve; 
space 
grips 
mass 
by 
telling 
it 
how 
to 
move.” 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
Big 
Bang, 
primordial 
space 
appears, 
as 
minimum 
limits 
are 
produced 
in 
each 
dimension. 
The 
minimum 
limit 
automatically 
produces 
a 
maximum 
that 
exists 
in 
a 
abstract 
sense. 
Even 
if 
matter 
is 
not 
developed, 
or 
the 
Universe 
has 
not 
arrived 
to 
it 
yet. 
Any 
Universe 
is 
always 
expanding 
or 
contracting, 
except 
during 
the 
inflection 
point, 
when 
it 
is 
stopped 
for 
a 
“while”, 
and 
changes 
its 
direction. 
With 
primordial 
space, 
we 
can 
not 
say 
how 
much 
time 
this 
“stop” 
takes, 
because 
time 
does 
exist 
at 
the 
beginning. 
With 
no 
velocity, 
there 
is 
no 
mass, 
no 
gravity, 
nothing, 
only 
space. 
Without 
gravity, 
abstract 
space 
is 
flat, 
having 
only 
a 
minimum 
length. 
We 
can't 
form 
a 
material 
object, 
because 
any 
geometrical 
form, 
has 
different 
distances 
that 
are 
shorter 
or 
longer. 
For 



example, 
a 
cube, 
with 
each 
edge 
equal 
Planck 
length, 
has 
a 
perimeter 
and 
diagonal 
longer 
than 
it, 
or 
if 
we 
chose 
a 
fraction 
of 
its 
edge, 
shorter. 
The 
sphere 
or 
circle 
are 
similar: 
If 
the 
radius 
is 
Planck 
length, 
it 
has 
a 
diameter, 
circumference, 
etc. 
that 
are 
longer; 
or 
arcs, 
that 
are 
shorter. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
space 
is 
the 
only 
entity, 
completely 
abstract, 
and 
primordial, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
a 
limit. 
Planck 
length 
is 
like 
a 
hole, 
with 
no 
material 
or 
geometrical 
design. 
In 
our 
Big 
Bang, 
before 
the 
first 
chronos, 
we 
had 
a 
flat 
scenario 
with 
three 
limits 
of 
the 
same 
size, 
Planck 
length, 
in 
each 
dimension, 
without 
forming 
a 
cube, 
but 
rather 
a 
“cuboide”. 
After 
that(in 
local 
sense), 
the 
beginning 
of 
hyperbolic 
space 
was 
formed, 
with 
Planck 
length, 
in 
its 
center, 
in 
two 
directions, 
our 
Universe 
of 
matter, 
and 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter 
in 
the 
other. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the 
mathematical 
formulas 
used 
to 
obtain 
mass 
and 
Planck 
length 
are 
squared, 
producing 
two 
roots: 
+ 
and 
-. 



11. 
Parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter 
In 
the 
first 
chronos, 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
all 
the 
4 
forces, 
including 


gravity 
were 
equal. 
λ 
and 
R 
were 
both 
Planck 
length. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
have 
an 
exact 
equality 
in 
both 
formulas. 
And 
so: 


ℏ/c.λ 
= 
R.c2/G 
where 
(Gℏ)/c3 
= 
Rλ=(Planck 
Length)2=λp2 


λ 
Planck= 
±√((Gℏ)/c3) 
≅ 
±1.616 
x 
10-33 
cm 
and 
also 


ℏ/(c.Mp)=(G.Mp)/c2 


(ℏ.c)/G=Mp2 


Mp= 
±√((ℏc)/G)≅ 
±2.17 
x10-5 
g 


Then, 
to 
obtain 
Planck 
length, 
we 
used 
the 
formula 
λp2=(Gℏ)/c3 
or 
λp= 
±√((Gℏ)/c3). 
This 
result 
shows 
us 
a 
reality. 
That 
there 
is 
not 
only 
one 
Planck, 
but 
two 
Plancks, 
one 
opposite 
to 
the 
other. 
The 
Planck 
mass 
equation 
shows 
us 
the 
same 
result: 
Mp2=(ℏc)/G 
or 
Mp=±√((ℏc)/G). 


These 
results 
indicates 
a 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter, 
opposite 
to 
our 
Universe 
of 
matter, 
and 
confirms 
a 
hyperbolic 
Universe. 
The 
constant 
distance 
between 
them 
is 
2λp; 
λp 
at 
each 
side. 
We 
can 
derive 
many 
concepts 
from 
this, 
which 
we 
will 
develop 
later. 



12. 
Masses 
of 
particles; 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
Aside 
from 
this 
flat 
scenario 
in 
our 
pre-Big 
Bang, 
there 
is 
another 
situation, 
where 
we 
can 
consider 
abstract 
space, 
when 
space 
is 
only 
a 
limit, 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
mass, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
Higgs 
length. 


Besides 
that, 
there 
are 
two 
different 
formulas 
to 
calculate 
mass, 
using 
theoretical 
calculations: 


1. 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
(Mass 
of 
the 
particles): 
ℏ/c.λ=m 
(where 
λ 
is 
the 
collision 
distance 
or 
Higgs 
length) 
2. 
Quantum 
Cosmological 
(cosmic 
mass): 
R.c2/G=m 
(where 
R 
is 
the 
cosmic 
radius). 
This 
formula 
is 
exact 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
and 
it 
is 
approximately 
exact, 
when 
the 
Universe 
is 
developing, 
because 
of 
the 
irregularities 
or 
ripples 
of 
space-time, 
the 
distortions 
of 
the 
spheric 
form, 
the 
centrifugal 
force, 
and 
the 
hyperbolic 
expansion. 
To 
obtain 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
particles 
we 
use 
the 
main 
principle 
of 
quantum 
mechanics, 
the 
uncertainty 
principle: 
ℏ=mcλ 
(where 
ℏ 
is 
Planck 
constant) 
. 
The 
Higgs 
lengths 
are 
very 
important 
concepts, 
but 
they 
need 
to 
be 
modified. 
The 
mass 
of 
particles 
have 
a 
correspondence 
with 
space 
(length) 
in 
an 
inverse 
relation 
(more 
length 
means 
less 
mass). 
Relation: 
k=mλ. 
The 
mass 
of 
all 
the 
particles 
can 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
constant 
relation 
k=mλ, 
where 
k 
is 
3.5 
x 
10-38 
g.cm 
or 
1.9392 
x 
10-14 
GeV.cm. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
concept 
later. 
The 
relation 
with 
space, 
is 
also 
fundamental 
in 
a 
cosmic 
scale, 
according 
to 
principles 
of 
Quantum 
Cosmological. 


The 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
increases 
with 
time, 
or 
in 
other 
terms, 
in 
direct 
relation 
with 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
cosmic 
radius. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
position 
later, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
confusion 
or 
break 
fundamental 
Laws 
of 
Physics. 


And 
so, 
in 
the 
Universe, 
another 
mass-space 
relation 
exists: 
G=R.c2/M 
where 
G 
is 
the 
Constant 
of 
Universal 
Gravitation. 
Relation: 
k1=R/M 
where 
k1 
is 
7.4236 
x10-29 
cm/g 
or 
1/k1 
=1.347 
x 
1028 
g/cm 



With 
this 
relation, 
we 
can 
only 
obtain 
the 
cosmic 
mass, 
because 
the 
macroscopic 
individual 
objects, 
use 
a 
very 
low 
velocity. 
Higgs 
field 
and 
the 
Universe, 
as 
a 
whole, 
use 
a 
speed 
around 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
The 
first 
constants 
of 
the 
Nature: 
c, 
G, 
ℏ, 
are 
obtained 
by 
equating 
both 
formulas, 
which 
are 
exact 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang. 



13. 
Particles 
and 
antiparticles 
About 
the 
formation 
of 
matter-antimatter, 
we 
need 
to 
indicate 
two 
things: 


a) 
Particles 
and 
antiparticles 
are 
produced 
by 
the 
Universe 
or 
even 
in 
the 
laboratory 
experiments, 
in 
equal 
quantities. 
Each 
particle 
is 
accompanied 
by 
an 
antiparticle, 
with 
identical 
mass 
but 
opposite 
charge, 
spin, 
and 
time. 
When 
in 
contact, 
matter 
and 
antimatter, 
can 
annihilate 
each 
other 
to 
produce 
pure 
energy, 
with 
practically 
100% 
efficiency. 
If 
particle 
and 
antiparticle 
production 
is 
identical, 
why 
is 
our 
Universe 
composed 
practically 
entirely 
of 
matter? 
The 
problem 
is 
to 
understand 
how 
matter 
came 
to 
existence 
without 
an 
equivalent 
quantity 
of 
antimatter. 
Symmetry 
between 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
is 
deep-rooted 
in 
the 
laws 
of 
Physics. 
Also 
between 
aggregated 
matter 
and 
aggregated 
antimatter, 
if 
we 
put 
into 
account 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
opposite 
to 
ours. 
A 
new 
theory 
says 
that 
besides 
some 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
colliding 
into 
each 
other, 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
antiparticles 
that 
go 
to 
the 
antimatter 
Universe; 
which 
realizes 
the 
inverse 
process, 
since 
their 
antiparticles 
are 
our 
own 
particles. 
In 
this 
way, 
each 
Universe 
increases 
its 
matter, 
interchanging 
its 
“waste” 
with 
the 
other 
Universe. 
This 
process 
began 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
According 
to 
the 
formula, 
there 
were 
two 
Big 
Bangs, 
like 
“two 
connected 
black 
holes”, 
and 
for 
this 
reason, 
the 
initial 
mass 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
double 
the 
quantity 
of 
mass 
in 
an 
equivalent 
black 
hole, 
with 
a 
gravitational 
radius 
the 
size 
of 
Planck 
length. 
The 
actual 
matter-antimatter 
theory 
consists 
in 
that 
there 
was 
an 
infinitesimal 
excess 
of 
matter, 
compared 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
antimatter 
(breaking 
the 
matter-antimatter 
symmetry, 
traditionally 
one 
of 
the 
inviolable 
rules 
of 
Physics) 
after 
almost 
all 
of 
the 
matter-antimatter 
production 
was 
eliminated 
(more 
than 
99.99999999 
%, 
producing 
one 
of 
the 
most 
inefficient 
processes). 
Nature 
is 
wise 
and 
always 
realizes 
a 
minimum 
effort. 
(Doubling 
the 
quantity 
of 
matter, 
interchanging 
“wastes”, 
is 
a 
super-efficient 
work). 
Besides, 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
matter-
antimatter 
asymmetry, 
a 
prediction 
of 
GUT 
is 
that 
protons 
are 
unstable 

and 
decay 
in 
positrons, 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
in 
about 
1033 
(to 
1044) 
years. 
An 
unreachable 
time, 
since 
our 
Universe 
will 
collapse 
approximately 
at 
1021 
seconds, 
or 
1014 
years. 
The 
stability 
of 
proton, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
fate 
of 
matter, 
is 
another 
inviolable 
rule 
of 
Physics. 
And 
what 
happens 
with 
the 
inviolability 
of 
the 
number 
of 
baryons 
and 
leptons? 
Finally, 
the 
uncertainty 
principle 
permits 
the 
existence 
of 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
in 
the 
same 
Universe, 
but 
like 
we 
explained 
before, 
this 
is 
only 
true 
in 
quantum 
mechanics. 
In 
a 
gravitational 
process, 
matter 
and 
antimatter 
needs 
to 
basically 
stay 
in 
separated 
Universes, 
black 
holes 
being 
the 
bridges 
necessary 
to 
interchange 
matter. 
We 
will 
continue 
to 
explain 
this 
later. 


b) 
Obtaining 
λp 
by 
means 
of 
G, 
ℏ 
and 
c, 
we 
could 
consider 
space 
as 
a 
derivate, 
when 
in 
reality, 
it 
is 
the 
original 
concept. 
Space 
can 
be 
obtained 
by 
using 
pure 
mathematical 
terms, 
without 
any 
constant 
of 
nature. 
As 
opposed 
to 
G, 
ℏ 
and 
c, 
which 
are 
derived 
from 
space.

Black 
holes 
Black 
holes 
are 
the 
most 
important 
objects 
in 
the 
Universe, 
more 
important 
than 
stars, 
planets, 
or 
even 
galaxies. 
Stephen 
Hawking’s 
works 
about 
black 
holes 
are 
sufficient 
enough 
to 
give 
him 
the 
Nobel 
Prize. 
Black 
holes 
are 
not 
only 
real; 
they 
are 
totally 
necessary 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
our 
Universe. 
There 
are 
3 
classes 
of 
them: 


a) 
Primordial 
black 
holes, 
existing 
at 
the 
microcosmos, 
when 
the 
production 
of 
matter-antimatter 
was 
fluent. 
Quantitatively 
numerous 
in 
that 
time, 
but 
with 
small 
mass 
and 
higher 
temperature. 
b) 
Medium 
black 
holes, 
produced 
by 
the 
collapsing 
of 
stars. 
c) 
Astrophysical 
giant 
black 
holes, 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies. 
Any 
black 
hole 
has 
a 
higher 
temperature 
when 
its 
mass 
is 
lighter. 
In 
them, 
entropy 
increases 
proportionally 
with 
the 
mass 
and 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
the 
temperature. 
That 
means 
that 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
properties 
of 
black 
holes, 
we 
need 
to 
use 
the 
equations 
of 
General 
Relativity, 
and 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
is 
totally 
irrelevant. 
The 
only 
case 
when 
we 
need 
to 
use 
quantum 
mechanic 
gravity 
is 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes, 
whose 
size 
is 
Planck 
length, 
and 
gravity 
and 
the 
other 
three 
forces 
are 
together; 
or 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
the 
radius 
was 
Planck 
length. 
The 
Big 
Bang 
also 
acted, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
like 
a 
center 
and 
like 
the 
event 
horizon 
of 
a 
black 
hole, 
with 
a 
gravitational 
radius 
size 
equal 
to 
Planck 
length, 
a 
naked 
co-singularity. 

15. 
Size 
of 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes 
Like 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
is 
always 
Planck 
length, 
the 
minimum 
size 
possible. 
It 
is 
never 
zero. 
All 
the 
matter 
that 
crosses 
the 
event 
horizon 
inexorably 
goes 
to 
the 
center 
of 
the 
black 
hole; 
which 
is 
connected, 
like 
a 
gateway, 
to 
the 
center 
of 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
which 
is 
attached 
to 
ours 
by 
black 
holes, 
or 
by 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Using 
Einstein’s 
equations, 
we 
can 
confirm 
this 
idea. 
In 
that 
situation, 
when 
time 
in 
our 
Universe 
comes 
to 
an 
end, 
time 
in 
the 
attached 
Universe 
begins. 
(If 
the 
center 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
is 
zero, 
we 
would 
have 
a 
space-time 
singularity 
and 
infinite 
curvature, 
two 
undesired 
terms, 
and 
time 
itself 
will 
come 
to 
its 
end, 
and 
space 
would 
come 
to 
a 
close). 
This 
is 
wrong. 
The 
CPT 
symmetry 
confirm 
us 
the 
former 
idea. 
To 
maintain 
it, 
we 
need 
to 
change: 
matter 
with 
antimatter; 
mirror 
symmetry, 
and 
the 
arrow 
of 
time 
Because 
the 
other 
Universe 
realizes 
the 
inverse 
process, 
quantitatively 
exact, 
there 
is 
no 
loss 
of 
information. 
It 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
research 
about 
space-time 
singularity 
at 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes, 
because 
singularities 
don’t 
exist. 
The 
process 
consists 
of 
an 
interchanging 
of 
matter-antimatter 
between 
both 
Universes, 
utilizing 
a 
gateway, 
with 
two 
gates, 
one 
in 
each 
Universe, 
with 
a 
dimension 
of 
Planck 
length, 
where 
quantum 
mechanics 
and 
general 
relativity 
interweave. 
Antimatter 
goes 
to 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
and 
matter 
comes 
from 
it 
to 
ours. 
Matter 
and 
antimatter 
are 
conventional 
terms 
and 
we 
can 
interchange 
them 
too. 
The 
important 
thing 
is 
to 
separate 
both 
complementary 
particles, 
and 
Stephen 
Hawking 
did 
it, 
using 
black 
holes. 
The 
original 
and 
complementary 
concepts 
about 
that 
will 
be 
explained 
in 
the 
next 
sections. 



16. 
Interchange 
of 
matter-antimatter; 
duplication 
of 
matter 
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
the 
process 
was 
simpler, 
because 
it 
was 
the 
only 
space 
that 
existed. 



Our 
Universe, 
even 
if 
we 
extend 
it, 
always 
has 
– 
in 
any 
place-a 
Planck 
length, 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
reach 
it, 
if 
we 
have 
enough 
energy 
to 
obtain 
λp; 
and 
in 
the 
other 
side, 
there 
exists 
a 
parallel 
Universe 
with 
a 
similar, 
but 
opposite 
process. 
The 
interchanging 
of 
matter-antimatter 
between 
them 
is 
easy 
to 
visualize, 
especially 
in 
the 
beginning. 
Moreover, 
in 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole, 
a 
cosingularity 
with 
λp 
length 
exists. 
(Size 
0 
doesn’t 
exist). 
And 
so, 
this 
center 
is 
attached 
to 
its 
parallel 
center, 
where 
another 
black 
hole 
exists. 
Both 
act 
together 
like 
a 
primordial 
Big 
Bang. 
In 
black 
holes, 
the 
process 
is 
the 
same 
as 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
but 
it 
requires 
a 
more 
elaborated 
system, 
because 
there 
is 
a 
bigger 
space 
outside 
of 
black 
holes. 
Like 
Hawking 
explained, 
the 
pair, 
particle-antiparticle, 
needs 
to 
separate 
outside, 
but 
near 
of 
the 
event 
horizon; 
and 
also 
needs 
to 
increase 
this 
process 
to 
separate 
more 
matter-antimatter 
pairs. 
The 
Universe 
needs 
to 
produce 
sufficient 
mass 
to 



annihilate 
little 
by 
little 
the 
mass 
inside 
the 
black 
hole, 
and 
to 
send 
the 
“waste” 
mass 
to 
the 
other 
Universe. 
If 
we 
add 
the 
inverse 
process, 
we 
obtain 
an 
efficient 
process, 
increasing 
mass 
in 
both 
Universes. 
If 
the 
matter 
inside 
the 
black 
hole 
is 
x, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
stimulate 
matter-
antimatter 
pairs; 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
symmetry, 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
matter 
and 
antimatter 
is 
necessary. 
Using 
a 
simple 
example: 
1.5x 
matter 
and 
1.5x 
antimatter, 
due 
to 
the 
circular 
motion 
ratio 
of 
the 
black 
hole. 
This 
is 
a 
gradual 
process, 
but 
in 
summary, 
1.5x 
matter 
is 
left 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
1.5x 
antimatter 
falls 
down 
inside 
the 
black 
hole, 
and 
gives 
to 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
0.5x 
of 
excess 
antimatter. 
The 
inverse 
process 
is 
similar, 
producing 
in 
both 
Universes 
the 
adequate 
mass, 
duplicating 
it 
(1.5x 
+ 
0.5x 
= 
2x). 
We 
can 
see 
this 
process 
as 
a 
Hawking 
radiation, 
decreasing 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
black 
hole. 
This 
process 
is 
qualitatively 
convenient, 
because 
it 
explains 
the 
black 
hole 
radiation; 
decreased 
mass; 
and 
can 
explain 
the 
duplication 
of 
mass 
in 
the 
formulas 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
black 
holes: 
Rc2/G=M 
and 
Rc2/2.G=M' 
Moreover 
it 
explains 
why 
black 
holes 
exist, 
and 
why 
they 
need 
to 
exist, 
even 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
aggregated 
matter 
didn´t 
exist. 
With 
this 
process, 
black 
holes 
would 
realize 
an 
efficient 
work, 
as 
nature 
likes 
to 
do. 
In 
normal 
radiation, 
energy 
is 
almost 
useless; 
in 
this 
process, 
energy 
is 
used 
to 
produce 
mass. 



17. 
Hawking 
radiation 
Although 
the 
process 
can 
be 
explained 
qualitatively, 
it 
maintains 
a 
problem 
in 
quantitative 
terms. 
Hawking 
radiation 
needs 
heat, 
and 
sufficient 
heat 
only 
existed 
in 
primordial 
black 
holes, 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era. 
In 
cosmic 
scale 
(right 
now) 
there 
are 
medium 
and 
giant 
black 
holes; 
even 
if 
they 
have 
a 
non-zero 
temperature, 
it 
is 
minimum, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
radiation 
is 
not 
sufficient. 
We 
could 
obtain 
a 
complementary 
aid 
from 
the 
gravitation 
and 
the 
enormous 
pressure 
in 
the 
center 
of 
giant 
black 
holes. 
We 
know 
that 
nature 
always 
work 
in 
an 
efficient 
manner. 
One 
way 
is 
that 
when 
the 
quantum 
wave 
is 
smaller, 
the 
mass 
is 
larger, 
and 
this 
is 
useful 
in 
the 
microscopic 
reality, 
where 
space 
is 
small. 
For 
that 
reason, 
Planck 
length 
is 
minimum 
and 
so, 
the 
mass 
is 
maximum. 
Using 
the 
smallest 
space 
we 
can 
interchange 
the 
biggest 
masses. 
It 
is 
a 
principle 
of 
maximum 
efficiency. 
For 
example, 
the 
minimum 
known 
mass 
of 
particles 
is 
the 
electron 
(5.14 
x 
10-4 
GeV) 
(electron-neutrino 
is 
still 
lighter, 
but 
physicists 
don´t 
know 
its 
mass, 
yet); 
and 
the 
maximum 
mass 
for 
a 
particle 
is 
2.39 
x 
1018 
GeV; 
moreover, 
the 
relation 
of 
space 
is 
1.506788419 
x 
10-11 
and 
1.615979906 
x 
10-33, 
considering 
their 
corresponding 
fields.

-Energy

The 
efficiency 
is: 
(1.2x1019)/(1.286975647x10-3) 
x 
(1.506788419x10-11)/(1.615979906x10-33) 
= 
8.694152115x1043 


If 
106 
is 
a 
million 
times 
more 
efficient, 
the 
actual 
relation 
is 
1043 
times 
more. 
When 
the 
particles 
enter 
the 
black 
hole 
in 
transit 
to 
the 
center, 
the 
enormous 
pressure 
(gravitation) 
would 
decrease 
their 
wavelength, 
until 
they 
have 
the 
minimum 
length 
in 
order 
to 
pass 
through 
the 
gateway. 
This 
process 
would 
be 
similar 
like 
time 
dilation 
and 
Lorentz 
contraction, 
important 
in 
speeds 
close 



to 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
Pressure, 
like 
heat, 
produces 
energy. 
For 
example, 
the 
Sun 
produces 
energy 
by 
heat 
(fusion); 
but 
Jupiter, 
a 
cold 
planet, 
also 
produces 
energy, 
liberated 
due 
to 
the 
gravitational 
collapse. 
Jupiter’s 
satellites 
receive 
two 
times 
more 
energy 
from 
Jupiter 
than 
from 
the 
Sun 
(a 
mechanism 
to 
liberate 
energy, 
using 
gravitation 
instead 
of 
heat). 
What 
would 
happen 
in 
giant 
black 
holes, 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies? 
In 
the 
“Elegant 
Universe" 
by 
Brian 
Greene, 
a 
beautiful 
book 
that 
explains 
Physics 
in 
easy 
words, 
we 
can 
read: 
“Hawking’s 
calculations 
also 
showed 
that 
the 
less 
massive 
a 
black 
hole 
is, 
the 
higher 
its 
temperature 
and 
the 
greater 
the 
radiation 
it 
emits. 
For 
instance, 
a 
black 
hole 
as 
light 
as 
a 
small 
asteroid 
would 
emit 
about 
as 
much 
radiation 
as 
a 
million-megaton 
hydrogen 
bomb, 
with 
radiation 
concentrated 
in 
the 
gamma-ray 
part 
of 
the 
electromagnetic 
spectrum. 
Astronomers 
have 
searched 
the 
night 
sky 
for 
such 
radiation, 
but 
except 
for 
a 
few 
long-shot 
possibilities, 
they 
have 
come 
up 
empty-handed, 
a 
likely 
indication 
that 
such 
low-mass 
black 
holes, 
if 
they 
exist, 
are 
very 
rare. 
As 
Hawking 
often 
jokingly 
points 
out, 
this 
is 
too 
bad, 
for 
it, 
the 
black 
hole 
radiation 
that 
his 
work, 
predicts 
were 
to 
be 
detected, 
he 
would 
undoubtedly 
win 
a 
Nobel 
Prize!” 
My 
position 
is 
that 
the 
radiation 
is 
produced 
inside 
black 
holes, 
but 
by 
annihilating 
matter-antimatter 
inside 
the 
event 
horizon, 
the 
radiation 
would 
be 
almost 
imperceptible. 
Besides 
that, 
not 
only 
radiation 
coming 
from 
heat 
in 
small 
black 
holes, 
but 
also 
by 
the 
high 
gravitational 
force 
in 
giant 
black 
holes, 
would 
produce 
sufficient 
energy 
to 
make 
particle– 
antiparticle 
pairs 
and 
realize 
the 
interchange 
of 
mass, 
between 
both 
Universes, 
inside 
of 
black 
holes. 


This 
process 
is 
not 
a 
theory. 
It 
is 
only 
an 
idea, 
a 
different 
and 
a 
logical 
concept, 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
develop 
the 
theory 
in 
order 
to 
complete 
it 
or 
correct 
it. 



18. 
Life 
of 
known 
proton. 
Existence 
of 
fourth 
type 
of 
neutrino 
To 
establish 
the 
life 
of 
the 
proton 
to 
be 
at 
least 
1033 
years, 
in 
order 
to 
be 
unstable, 
is 
absurd. 
That 
time 
is 
much 
longer 
than 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Universe 
itself. 
Before 
that 
period, 
all 
of 
the 
particles 
of 
the 
Universe 
will 
be 
destroyed. 
So, 
taking 
a 
large 
lump 
of 
matter 
containing 
more 
than 
1033 
protons 
and 
to 
expect 
to 
see 
one, 
or 
two, 
disintegrating 
protons 
within 
this 
mass, 
each 
year, 
is 
a 
correct 
mathematical 
concept, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
physical 
incongruence. 
In 
the 
whole 
life 
of 
our 
Universe 
(9.75x1021 
s) 
every 
proton 
will 
be 
stable; 
and 
so, 
all 
the 
experiments 
in 
any 
form, 
about 
its 
stability, 
will 
not 
have 
a 
satisfying 
result. 
The 
proton 
does 
not 
decay, 
but 
its 
lifetime 
is 
not 
infinite, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
destroyed 
with 
the 
Big 
Crush 
of 
the 
Universe. 


For 
that 
reasons, 
despite 
a 
number 
of 
careful 
experiments, 
there 
was 
no 
evidence 
of 
the 
disintegration 
of 
the 
proton. 
So, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
predictions 
of 
the 
Grand 
Unification 
Theory 
was 
not 
confirmed. 
However, 
we 
will 
explain 
later 
the 
decay 
of 
other 
kind 
of 
proton 
(heavy 
proton), 
existing 
in 
GUT 
energies, 
that 
is 
unstable. 
According 
to 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
the 
neutrinos 
do 
not 
have 
mass, 
but 
this 
is 
another 
mistake. 
Considering 
two 
premises, 
the 
neutrinos 
have 
mass 
(insignificant 
but 
measurable) 
and 
the 
protons 
are 
stable 
during 
the 
life 
of 
our 
Universe. 


In 
that 
way 
we 
have 
3 
new 
realities: 


1. 
The 
proton 
is 
stable. 
2. 
The 
mass 
of 
the 
normal 
left-handed 
neutrino 
is 
no 
longer 
supposed 
to 
be 
zero. 
(Real 
mass 
≅ 
1.13 
x 
10-14 
GeV). 
The 
other 
known 
two 
neutrinos, 
also 
have 
masses: 
2 
x 
10-9 
GeV 
and 
1 
x10-6 
GeV, 
respectively. 
3. 
The 
normal 
left-handed 
neutrino 
has 
a 
right-handed 
partner 
with 
an 
enormous 
mass, 
both 
of 
them 
with 
their 
corresponding 
antimatter 
pair. 
The 
experiments 
provided 
evidence 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
fourth 
type 
of 
neutrino. 

The 
decay 
rate 
of 
the 
Z0 
shows 
only 
3 
light 
neutrinos, 
but 
there 
is 
no 
contradiction 
in 
this 
new 
neutrino, 
because 
it 
does 
not 
enter 
in 
the 
decay 
of 
Z0, 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
new 
neutrino 
is 
heavier 
than 
Z0. 
Neutronio 
could 
be 
an 
adequate 
name. 
When 
the 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
occurs, 
the 
right-handed 
neutrino 
becomes 
extremely 
massive, 
more 
than 
Z0. 
(And 
Z0, 
W+, 
and 
W-acquire 
masses). 


Today´s 
accelerators 
have 
the 
sufficient 
capacity 
to 
find 
this 
new 
neutral 
particle, 
even 
if 
physicists 
don’t 
believe 
in 
it. 
However, 
thousands 
of 
experiments 
and 
billions 
and 
billions 
of 
dollars 
have 
been 
spent, 
trying 
to 
find 
the 
superpartners, 
even 
if 
there 
is 
not 
the 
most 
remote 
evidence 
that 
they 
exist, 
at 
least, 
in 
the 
supposed 
range 
of 
masses. 


With 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
top 
quark, 
only 
2 
different 
particles 
are 
left 
to 
be 
discovered, 
with 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
accelerators 
we 
have 
right 
now 
and 
in 
the 
near 
future: 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
and 
this 
new 
neutrino 
with 
its 
corresponding 
antimatter 
(mass 
around 
132 
GeV). 
Physicists 
should 
try 
to 
find 
this 
new 
particle. 
It 
would 
be 
an 
important 
discovery 
and 
a 
change 
in 
the 
actual 
theoretical 
study, 
and 
with 
a 
relatively 
small 
cost. 
It's 
necessary 
to 
analyze 
the 
statistical 
fluctuations 
and 
the 
excess 
of 
events 
around 
140 
GeV. 
The 
last 
experiments 
of 
the 
LHC 
(Atlas 
and 
CMS), 
reported 
in 
August 
2011, 
could 
consider 
the 
existence 
of 
this 
possible 
heavier 
neutral 
particle. 
(Neutronio 
mass 
around 
132 
GeV); 
or 
perhaps, 
another 
particle 
with 
similar 
mass, 
although 
this 
last 
possibility 
would 
be 
a 
long-shot. 



19. 
Mass 
of 
electron 
neutrino. 
Heavy 
partners. 
Massless 
photon 
In 
1930, 
experiments 
suggested 
that 
some 
nuclear 
decays 
did 
not 
conserve 
energy; 
less 
energy 
was 
detected 
in 
the 
final 
state 
than 
in 
the 
initial 
one. 
Wolfgang 
Pauli 
proposed 
that 
the 
energy 
was 
being 
carried 
off 
by 
an 
unseen 
particle, 
the 
neutrino, 
with 
no 
electric 
charge 
and 
that 
it 
interacted 
via 
the 
weak 
force. 
Some 
physicists 
consider 
that 
the 
neutrino 
has 
no 
mass, 
but 
this 
is 
a 
contradiction. 
Others 
give 
it 
mass, 
with 
different 
values, 
but 
Steven 
Weinberg, 
Nobel 
laureate, 
is 
the 
only 
physicist 
that 
gave 
it 
the 
approximate 
real 
mass 
of 
the 
neutrino, 
in 
his 
book 
“Dreams 
of 
a 
Final 
Theory”, 
Weinberg 
wrote: 
“We 
would 
expect 
neutrinos 
to 
have 
small 
masses, 
about 
a 
hundredth 
to 
a 
thousandth 
of 
a 
volt 
(or 
in 
other 
words, 
about 
one 
billionth 
the 
mass 
of 
an 
electron)”. 


Similarly, 
in 
the 
heavy 
scale 
the 
new 
particle 
that 
we 
mentioned 
before, 
the 
Neutronio 
could 
appear, 
heavy, 
neutral, 
mass 
approximately 
132 
GeV, 
and 
acting 
only 
by 
weak 
interaction. 
The 
accelerators 
have 
reached 
this 
level 
and 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
wait 
for 
an 
increase 
in 
their 
energy; 
we 
only 
need 
to 
test 
carefully 
around 
that 
level. 
Certain 
predictions 
could 
be 
made 
with 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
other 
particles 
that 
emerged 
in 
the 
decay, 
and 
those 
predictions 
can 
verify 
the 
indirect 
evidence 
that 
this 
neutral 
heavy 
particle 
in 
effect 
exists, 
before 
it 
could 
be 
directly 
detected. 
Besides 
that, 
there 
exists 
a 
boson 
that 
it 
is 
sure 
to 
be 
detected, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
which 
is 
completely 
unstable, 
and 
its 
mass 
is 
larger, 
between 
382.4 
GeV 
and 
482.4 
GeV. 
According 
to 
the 
actual 
theory, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
make 
sense, 
the 
superpartner’s 
masses 
must 
be 
similar 
to 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
known 
heaviest 
particles 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
like 
W, 
Z, 
or 
the 
top 
quark. 
If 
the 
superpartners 
are 
not 
observed 
before 
the 
maximum 
level 
of 
is 
482.4 
GeV, 
this 
will 
show 
that 
Nature, 
in 
our 
real 
world 
with 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
1 
time, 
is 
not 
supersymmetric. 
According 
to 
Supersymmetry, 
like 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
there 
are 
no 
particles 
with 
masses 
heavier 
than 
the 
Higgs 
boson, 
by 
destruction 
of 
the 
Higgs 
effect, 
because 
there 
is 
“too 
much 
heat” 
According 
to 
the 
Dirac 
equation, 
the 
duality 
particle–antiparticle 
doubles 
the 
number 
of 
particles. 



Supersymmentry 
predicts 
another 
doubling 
of 
the 
number 
of 
particles 
with 
different 
masses 
and 
spins; 
(subtracting 
1/2), 
but 
there 
is 
another 
possibility. 
According 
to 
T-duality, 
and 
most 
notably, 
R 
→ 
α.1/R 
duality, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
double 
the 
number 
of 
particles, 
with 
only 
different 
masses, 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
families 
from 
3 
to 
6; 
even 
if 
in 
reality 
there 
is 
only 
one 
family, 
with 
different 
copies 
or 
clones 
from 
it. 
The 
new 
partners 
would 
be 
very 
much 
heavier, 
and 
so, 
the 
superpartners 
would 
be 
real 
heavypartners. 
Moreover, 
if 
normal 
particles 
need 
a 
large 
room, 
with 
completely 
different 
masses, 
and 
all 
superpartners 
existing 
in 
a 
small 
room, 
with 
similar 
masses 
between 
them, 
would 
produce 
an 
ugly 
anti-symmetry, 
comparing 
them 
with 
the 
normal 
scale. 
For 
example, 
if 
sneutrino 
and 
selectron 
have 
not 
appeared 
yet, 
it 
is 
improbable 
that 
they 
both 
appear 
in 
the 
small 
space 
available, 
close 
to 
the 
stop 
quark. 


In 
the 
Dirac 
equation, 
if 
a 
boson 
has 
no 
charge, 
it 
is 
its 
own 
antiparticle. 
Using 
T 
duality, 
if 
a 
boson 
never 
has 
mass, 
it 
is 
its 
own 
partner. 
As 
we 
will 
explain 
later, 
only 
the 
photon 
never 
acquires 
mass; 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
the 
photon 
is 
the 
only 
particle 
of 
force, 
completely 
stable, 
that 
never 
changes.

20. 
Exact 
value 
of 
constants 
since 
the 
Big 
Bang 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
abstract 
space 
(primordial) 
is 
only 
limits. 
The 


minimum 
limit 
has 
a 
corresponding 
maximum 
limit, 
according 
to 
T-

symmetry. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
tendency 
to 
reach 
it 
produces 
movement. 
Immediately 
after 
that, 
speed 
of 
(light) 
c 
and 
t 
(time), 
and 
after 
them, 
G 
and 
ℏ, 
the 
constants 
of 
gravitation 
and 
electromagnetism 
are 
derived. 
c, 
G, 
and 
ℏ 
are 
truly 
constant, 
and 
their 
values 
are 
fixed 
from 
the 
first 
chronos 
to 
the 
last 
event 
of 
the 
Universe 
Their 
present 
waves 
have 
no 
differences 
between 
past 
and 
future 
ones, 
neither 
c, 
G, 
nor 
ℏ 
were 
smaller 
or 
bigger. 
Since 
the 
beginning 
of 
time, 
in 
the 
first 
chronos, 
when 
the 
gravitation 
and 
quantum 
waves 
had 
the 
same 
mass, 
same 
energy, 
and 
same 
length; 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c 
will 
remain 
inexorably 
exact, 
until 
the 
last 
event, 
when 
our 
Universe 
ends, 
in 
a 
complete 
collapse 
and 
colossal 
Big 
Crush.

The 
energy 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
considered 
the 
maximum 
for 
a 
Higgs 
field, 
but 
it 
is 
minimum 
for 
the 
Universe. 


The 
Higgs 
fields 
pervades 
all 
the 
Universe 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
maximum 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
not 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
because 
the 
relation 
of 
energy 
is: 


E.Higgs 
x 
n 



Where 
E.Higgs 
is 
the 
energy 
of 
one 
Higgs 
field; 
and 
n, 
the 
number 
of 
fields. 
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
there 
was 
only 
one 
Higgs 
field, 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
was 
minimum 
and 
not 
maximum. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
Standard 
Model 
proposition, 
that 
in 
lengths 
much 
smaller 
than 
10-17cm, 
particles 
have 
no 
mass, 
is 
a 
completely 
wrong 
position, 
as 
we 
will 
later 
explain 
with 
more 
details. 



21. 
Mass 
as 
a 
fundamental 
property 
of 
particles 
of 
matter 
Nature 
never 
does 
any 
unnecessary 
work, 
and 
always 
uses 
the 
easiest 
way. 
Antimatter 
is 
a 
reality 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
particles 
are 
almost 
doubled 
by 
their 
antimatter 
partners. 
However, 
some 
physicists 
propose 
new 
kinds 
of 
supposed 
particles: 
superpartners 
and 
their 
antiparticles, 
including 
the 
particles 
of 
force. 
Even 
the 
photon, 
the 
most 
constant 
force, 
has 
its 
photino, 
(?!) 
and 
moreover, 
even 
particles 
without 
masses, 
before 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
appearance. 
The 
particles 
are 
multiplied 
not 
by 
2, 
but 
by 
26=64. 



The 
question 
is 
why? 
Particle 
with 
antiparticles 
are 
related 
by 
mirror 
symmetry 
(horizontal). 
Particles 
with 
heavy 
partners 
are 
related 
by 
T-symmetry 
(vertical). 


Accordingtorotations,thenumber6wouldchangelikethis.
Differently, 
symmetry 
about 
spins 
(superpartners) 
has 
different 
laws, 
and 
fermions 
would 
have 
relation 
with 
scalar 
bosons. 
The 
supposition 
that 
particles 
(and 
antiparticles) 
have 
no 
mass 
in 
the 
second 
scale, 
would 
form 
a 
whole 
new 
kind 
of 
particles, 
because 
mass 
is 
a 
fundamental 
property 
of 
particles 
of 
matter. 
One 
particle 
with 
no 
mass 
is 
not 
the 
same 
particle 
without 
mass; 
it 
is 
a 
whole 
new 
particle. 



We 
propose: 
particles-antiparticles, 
heavypartners-antiheavypartners, 
multiplying 
the 
number 
of 
particles 
by 
8, 
or 
23; 
instead 
of 
26=64. 
We 
can 
divide 
the 
microuniverse 
in 
four 
sections:

Symmetry 
about 
spin 
in 
particles. 
Code 
of 
string 
Universes 
The 
symmetry 
of 
the 
superstring 
theory 
has 
a 
mathematical 
consistence 
but 
only 
in 
10 
and 
26 
dimensions. 
It 
is 
a 
beautiful 
mathematical 
theory, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
applicable 
in 
our 
physical 
world 
of 
4 
dimensions. 


The 
mathematical 
theory 
is 
correct 
in 
10 
and 
26 
dimensions, 
and 
perhaps 
in 
50, 
82, 
122, 
170, 
and 
226 
dimensions. 
In 
order 
to 
do 
a 
dimensional 
package 
of 
8 
moduli; 
2 
dimensions 
(one 
space 
+ 
one 
time) 
would 
be 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
string, 
and 
would 
complete 
the 
symmetry 
about 
strings. 
The 
reason, 
why 
a 
two-dimensional 
world 
is 
not 
taken 
into 
account, 
is 
because 
the 
position 
of 
Superstring 
theory 
is 
to 
accommodate 
our 
world 
of 
4 
dimensions 
in 
it, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
2 
dimensions 
have 
no 
room 
to 
accommodate 
our 
physical 
world 
of 
4. 
But 
2 
dimensions 
are 
sufficient 
to 
accommodate 
a 
first 
string 
world. 
The 
formula 
is: 
4n2-4n+2, 
where 
n 
is 
the 
string 
sequence, 
from 
1 
until 
8, 
or 
(2n-1)2+1 
or 
8(n.(n-1))/2+2. 



23. 
Process 
to 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
Another 
thing, 
particles 
without 
masses 
are 
against 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
primordial 
in 
quantum 
mechanics. 
If 
particles 
of 
matter 
with 
no 
mass 
existed, 
ℏ 
would 
be 
zero, 
or 
λ 
infinite. 
Both 
results 
are 
wrong. 
And 
moreover, 
why 
finding 
other 
complicated 
theories, 
when 
the 
normal 
way 
to 
obtain 
a 
particle's 
mass 
is 
only 
changing 
the 
space 
(wavelength), 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
collision 
distance, 
Higgs 
length, 
or 
Compton 
wavelength. 
Any 
name 
would 
do. 


The 
collision 
distance 
between 
matter–antimatter 
particles 
is 
the 
exact 
distance 
where 
the 
particles 
can 
relate, 
while 
each 
one 
holding 
a 
private 
identity. 
Any 
closer, 
they 
collide 
and 
destroy 
themselves. 
Any 
farther, 
they 
go 
away. 
It 
establishes 
a 
field 
(Higgs 
field) 
where 
its 
energy 
(or 
mass) 
is 
the 
total 
of 
the 
system, 
according 
to 
the 
relation: 
ℏ/cλ=m; 
or 
k=mλ. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
leptons, 
their 
mass 
is 
obtained 
by 
dividing 
the 
field 
by 
√(2π). 
In 
case 
of 
quarks, 
the 
relation 
is 
not 
2 
particles, 
but 
4, 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
field 
would 
be 
divided 
by 
2√2π 
or 
√(8π) 
(in 
case 
of 
quarks 
having 
the 
same 
mass). 
Because 
quarks 
normally 
have 
different 
masses, 
and 
they 
have 
resonances, 
the 
division 
by 
√(2π) 
is, 
approximately, 
the 
sum 
of 
both. 
This 
is 
a 
sketch 
on 
how 
to 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
Higgs 
fields 
and 
the 
masses 
of 
particles, 
which 
we 
will 
later 
explain 
with 
more 
details. 
Right 
now, 
the 
position 
that 
we 
desire 
to 
point 
out 
is 
that 
the 
only 
factor 
we 
need, 
to 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
particles, 
is 
space, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
different 
families. 



24. 
Nature 
only 
needs 
one 
family. 
Time 
as 
natural 
logarithmic 
Basically, 
they 
are 
4 
particles 
for 
each 
family. 
Only 
one 
family 
is 
necessary 
in 
our 
cosmic 
scale. 
The 
other 
particles 
are 
exact 
copies 
of 
them, 
according 
to 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
things 
in 
our 
Macrocosmos 
need 
only 
that 
one 
family, 
with 
those 
4 
particles: 
electrons, 
up-quarks, 
down-
quarks 
and 
electron-neutrinos 
(the 
latter, 
traveling 
alone 
in 
our 
Universe, 
passing 
through 
stars, 
planets, 
our 
bodies, 
and 
any 
kind 
of 
matter, 
with 
almost 
no 
contact. 
These 
4 
particles 
are 
the 
lightest 
and 
so, 
stable; 
and 
practically, 
are 
the 
only 
ones 
nature 
needs 
right 
now. 
But 
what 
happened 
in 
the 
Microcosmos 
era? 
(sometimes 
reproduced 
artificially 
with 
the 
actual 
giant 
atom 
smashers, 
at 
a 
scale 
of 
around 
ln(λp/2) 
or 
√(λp 
): 
-37.75268327 
(ln) 
or 
4.019925255x10-17) 
We 
think 
in 
arithmetical 
time, 
but 
nature 
thinks 
in 
logarithmic 
time, 
especially 
in 
the 
Microcosmos 
era, 
starting 
from 
Planck 
length, 
when 
the 
first 
Higgs 
field 
existed, 
finalizing, 
at 
1cm, 
approximately, 
where 
the 
last 
Higgs 
field 
appeared. 
The 
time 
it 
took 
was 
almost 
nothing 
for 
us, 
less 
than 
3.33 
x 
10-11 
s, 
but 
for 
the 
Universe, 
it 
was 
more 
“time” 
than 
the 
time 
developed 
in 
our 
cosmological 
time 
(human 
measure) 
of 
millions 
of 
years. 
Nature 
needs 
other 
“families” 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
corresponding 
particles 
at 
any 
moment. 
“Nature 
abhors 
the 
vacuum”, 
but 
being 
economic 
and 
efficient, 
it 
produces 
“copies” 
of 
the 
same 
family, 
clones 
of 
it. 
Higgs 
length 
changes, 
at 
any 
moment, 
automatically, 
when 
abstract 
space 
(Higg 
space 
or 
h=ct) 
is 
arriving, 
according 
to 
simple 
rules, 
which 
we 
will 
explain 
later. 
Nature 
produces 
the 
“same” 
particles 
with 
identical 
properties, 
except 
for 
their 
mass, 
which 
is 
lighter, 
as 
the 
length 
increases, 
according 
to 
the 
relation: 
mass= 
ℏ/c.λ 
or 
m.λ=k. 
Physicists 
have 
proven 
the 
structure 
of 
matter 
until 
the 
scale 
of 
around 
√(λp)≅4.02 
x 
10-17 
cm, 
or 
close 
to 
it, 
which 
consists 
of 
some 
combination 
of 
particles 
from 
3 
families 
and 
their 
antimatter 
partners. 
The 
rest 
of 
that 
scale, 
between 
4.02 
x 
10-17 
cm 
~1.616 
x 
10-33 
cm, 
in 
which 
the 
other 
3 
families 
will 
probably 
exist, 
if 
the 
prediction 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
that 
the 
Higgs 
field 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat, 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
false. 



But 
in 
the 
true 
sense, 
there 
are 
not 
three 
or 
six 
families, 
only 
one. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
family, 
but 
with 
different 
manifestations, 
according 
to 
the 
length. 


The 
Higgs 
field 
in 
the 
Microcosmos 
era 
changes 
continuously, 
as 
time 
increases, 
according 
to 
h=ct, 
and 
automatically, 
the 
Universe 
produces 
the 
“same” 
particles, 
with 
different 
“sizes”, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
different 
“masses”. 
It 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
uncertainty 
principle. 
Nature 
realizes 
the 
same 
work, 
using 
the 
same 
principle 
and 
the 
same 
law. 
And 
that 
is 
efficiency: 
to 
have 
an 
automatic 
process, 
very 
diversified, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
very 
simplified. 
Using 
the 
same 
pieces, 
and 
realizing 
the 
same 
process, 
it 
produces 
different 
products, 
only 
using 
different 
sizes 
of 
pieces, 
according 
to 
the 
market 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
Physics, 
according 
the 
special 
moment 
of 
Universe 
and 
corresponding 
Higgs 
length). 
Besides, 
three 
families 
with 
only 
a 
mass 
difference, 
means 
that 
all 
particles 
of 
matter 
have 
mass, 
including 
the 
3 
known 
neutrinos. 
If 
mass 
is 
the 
only 
difference, 
and 
they 
don’t 
have 
mass, 
why 
are 
there 
three? 
And 
please, 
don’t 
forget 
the 
Uncertainly 
Principle. 



25. 
Four 
forces 
united 
at 
the 
first 
chronos 
The 
four 
forces: 
gravity, 
strong, 
electromagnetic, 
and 
weak, 
were 
together, 
only 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
Gravity 
separated 
first, 
after 
the 
first 
chronos. 
The 
strong 
force 
did 
it 
second. 
The 
electromagnetic 
and 
weak 
force 
went 
apart 
last. 
Four 
forces 
have 
3 
separations. 
For 
a 
simple 
example: 
four 
fingers 
have 
three 
separations: 



At 
the 
end, 
the 
electromagnetic 
and 
weak 
forces 
were 
separated, 
even 
having 
different 
strength. 
However, 
electromagnetic 
fixed 
its 
position 
and 
accompanied 
the 
weak 
force, 
until 
the 
weak 
force 
separated, 
and 
the 
electromagnetic 
force 
returned 
to 
its 
place. 
In 
any 
separation, 
symmetry 
is 
decreasing, 
“loosing 
a 
phase”. 
There 
were 
3 
Higgs 
bosons 
in 
our 
Universe. 


a) 
Gravitational 
Higgs 
boson 
at 
the 
beginning 
(gravity 
separates 
from 
the 
other 
three 
forces, 
immediately 
after 
the 
first 
chronos). 
b) 
Strong 
Higgs 
Boson. 
(The 
strong 
separates 
from 
the 
other 
two 
forces) 
c) 
There 
is 
no 
electromagnetic 
boson. 
(Photon 
always 
is 
stable 
and 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest) 
d) 
Weak 
Higgs 
boson. 
(The 
photon 
accompanies 
the 
weak 
force 
to 
separate 
from 
it. 
For 
that 
reason, 
W+, 
W-and 
Z0 
acquire 
masses 
and 
the 
photon 
continues 
with 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest. 
There 
are 
3 
Higgs 
bosons, 
where 
the 
particles 
of 
forces 
acquire 
masses. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
procedure 
for 
the 
particles 
of 
matter, 
neither 
for 
the 
photon. 



26. 
Higgs 
bosons 
fields' 
mass 
and 
lengths 
After 
the 
Last 
Event, 
when 
our 
Universe 
collapses, 
another 
Gravitational 
Higgs 
Boson 
will 
appear. 
It 
will 
enter 
to 
form 
part 
of 
a 
transitional 
new 
Universe: 
the 
fractal 
3-4 
Universe 
(or 
4-5 
in 
space–time 
Universes), 
before 
the 
new 
five-dimensional 
(4+1) 
Universe 
appears. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
process 
later. 
The 
mathematical 
sequence 
indicates 
that 
the 
dominant 
position 
of 
each 
force 
is 
n!, 
beginning 
at 
the 
origin. 
And 
so, 
the 
formula 
for 
Higgs 
bosons 
is: 



We 
write 
origin, 
because 
0! 
is 
1 
and 
origin 
is 
cozero 
(Planck 
station) 
that 
means 
∅, 
1, 
2, 
6, 
24. 
When 
we 
analyze 
the 
formula 
of 
space, 
ex, 
x 
is 
basically 
8πn. 
In 
that 
way 
8πn 
means 
24π 
(8π.3 
dimensions) 
and 
so, 
e+24π 
will 
approximately 
be 
the 
maximum 
space; 
and 
e-24π, 
the 
minimum 
space 
(the 
exact 
formula 
will 
be 
detailed 
later). 
+24 
and 
-24, 
mean 
48 
steps 
in 
between, 
and 
adapting 
the 
sequence 
to 
48, 
we 
need 
to 
double 
the 
terms. 
And 
so, 
the 
formula 
for 
Higgs 
boson 
is: 



➢ 
k=-24π 
➢ 
k=-22π 
➢ 
k=-20π 
➢ 
k=-12π 
➢ 
k=+24π 


The 
lengths 
of 
each 
field 
are: 



➢ 
k=-24π=1.615979906 
x 
10-33 
cm 
➢ 
k=-22π=8.731046397 
x 
10-31 
cm 
➢ 
k=-20π=4.717334068 
x 
10-28 
cm 
➢ 
k=-12π=4.01992527 
x 
10-17 
cm 
➢ 
k=+24π=2.923096699 
x 
1032 
cm 


Using 
Ockham's 
razor, 
k+24π 
disappears. 
It's 
located 
outside 
this 
Universe. 
The 
former 
lengths 
are 
the 
wavelength 
of 
each 
field. 
Using 
the 
formula: 


m=(1.9392x10-14)/λ 
mass 
in 
GeV 


➢ 
Gravitational 
Higgs 
field: 
1.2 
x 
1019 
GeV 
➢ 
Strong 
Higgs 
field: 
2.22 
x 
1016 
GeV 
➢ 
Weak 
Higgs 
field: 
4.824 
x 
102 
GeV 
or 
482.4 
GeV 
There 
are 
Higgs 
fields 
when 
Higgs 
bosons 
appear, 
but 
there 
are 
many 
Higgs 
fields 
with 
no 
bosons. 
They 
will 
be 
explained 
later 
in 
a 
mathematical 
sequence. 
We 
call 
these 
fields, 
modified 
Higgs 
fields. 



27. 
Two 
scales 
for 
particles 
of 
force 
By 
means 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
the 
weak 
particles 
of 
force 
acquire 
mass. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
elucidate 
that 
the 
other 
particles 
of 
force 
must 
acquire 
mass 
too, 
when 
its 
corresponding 
Higgs 
boson 
appears. 
However 
in 
actual 
physics 
concepts, 
all 
the 
other 
particles 
of 
force 
continue 
without 
mass. 
This 
is 
an 
unnatural 
process. 
The 
explanation 
would 
be, 
there 
are 
two 
scales, 
where 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale, 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
(except 
the 
photon) 
acquire 
mass, 
and 
in 
the 
lighter 
scale, 
with 
no 
Higgs 
boson, 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
have 
no 
mass, 
like 
it 
normally 
must 
be. 
Because 
the 
weak 
force 
is 
the 
last 
one 
that 
separates, 
and 
actual 
technology 
permits 
to 
do 
experimental 
results 
with 
average 
masses; 
not 
too 
heavy, 
neither 
too 
light, 
we 
can 
prove 
the 
heavier 
scale 
in 
weak 
force; 
and 
the 
lighter 
scale, 
in 
strong 
and 
gravity. 
Particle 
accelerators 
are 
probing 
at 
around 
10-18 
cm, 
or 
10-19 
cm, 
with 
this 
power, 
it 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
calculate 
the 
heavier 
scale 
in 
weak 
force, 
and 
the 
lighter 
scale 
in 
the 
other 
forces. 


Like 
explained 
before, 
the 
photon 
will 
never 
have 
mass, 
and 
the 
photino 
doesn’t 
exist. 
There 
is 
no 
technological 
development 
to 
prove 
the 
lighter 
scale 
in 
weak 
force. 
It 
has 
relation 
with 
the 
production 
of 
known 
neutrinos. 
For 
the 
same 
reasons, 
the 
Standard 
Model 
supposes 
neutrinos 
have 
no 
mass. 
Moreover, 
the 
weak 
heavier 
scale 
has 
a 
logical 
mass, 
because 
it 
is 
using 
relatively 
heavy 
particles. 
In 
the 
weak 
lighter 
scale, 
used 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
neutrinos, 
is 
illogical 
to 
need 
forces 
of 
around 
90 
GeV 
for 
particles 
that 
have 
masses 
of 
10-14 
GeV, 
or 
even, 
for 
some 
physicists, 
zero 
mass. 
In 
the 
lighter 
scale, 
the 
masses 
of 
force 
particles, 
like 
the 
gluon 
and 
the 
graviton, 
disappear, 
In 
summary 
we 
suppose: 




Graviton 
had 
mass 
only 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
the 
4 
forces 
were 
united, 
and 
quantum 
mechanics 
applied 
to 
it. 
At 
that 
moment, 
the 
graviton 
was 
equivalent 
to 
the 
more 
typical 
fundamental 
string, 
whose 
mass 
is 
pointed 
out 
in 
the 
table. 
After 
Planck, 
quantum 
mechanics 
don´t 
apply 
to 
gravity. 
And 
so, 
after 
that, 
the 
graviton 
(gravitational 
force 
particle) 
had 
zero 
mass 
and 
it 
will 
maintain 
zero 
mass, 
until 
the 
collapse 
of 
our 
Universe, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
until 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
gravitational 
boson, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
another 
dimension. 



28. 
Minkowski-Einstein 
space-time 
Like 
we 
mentioned 
before, 
Herman 
Minkowski 
explained, 
and 
Einstein 
used 
and 
developed, 
that 
space 
and 
time 
formed 
a 
continuum 
union: 
Space-time. 
Time 
was 
treated 
as 
a 
fourth 
dimension, 
almost 
like 
space. 
This 
union 
is 
converted 
in 
a 
total 
unity 
at 
the 
beginning, 
or 
close 
to 
it, 
and 
at 
the 
last 
event 
of 
the 
Universe, 
or 
close 
to 
it. 
In 
that 
position, 
the 
formulas 
about 
the 
minimum 
limit 
(Planck 
length) 
and 
maximum 
limit 
must 
incorporate 
time, 
as 
negative 
space. 
But, 
even 
if 
space 
and 
time 
interweave 
into 
a 
single 
entity, 
space-time, 
space 
is 
still 
space, 
and 
time 
is 
still 
time. 
But 
if 
we 
adopt 
the 
position 
that 
time 
intervals 
are 
imaginary 
numbers, 
then 
space 
and 
time, 
become 
identical, 
and 
time 
becomes 
really 
a 
fourth 
dimension 
of 
space; 
in 
other 
words, 
time 
intervals 
might 
be 
indistinguishable 
form 
space 
intervals, 
hence 
“imaginary 
time”. 
This 
position 
is 
fundamental 
when 
we 
use 
the 
mathematical 
formulas 
to 
obtain 
by 
means 
of 
100% 
theoretical 
calculations, 
minimum 
and 
maximum 
space 
of 
any 
Universe, 
and 
in 
this 
specific 
situation, 
will 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
to 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe 
too. 
We 
said 
before, 
zero 
space 
doesn’t 
exist; 
but 
zero 
space 
exists 
in 
exponential 
form. 
Using 
natural 
logarithms, 
the 
limit 
can 
be 
obtained 
with 
a 
formula, 
using 
ex 
where 
e 
is 
the 
natural 
logarithmic 
and 
x 
is 
the 
equation 
to 
obtain 
the 
limits. 
Calculating 
a 
maximum 
and 
a 
minimum, 
we 
have 
2 
potential 
formulas 
minimum 
limit: 
e-x 
maximum 
limit: 
ex. 
As 
time 
is 
completely 
integrated 
with 
space, 
we 
use 
imaginary 
time, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
i, 
must 
be 
integrated 
into 
both 
formulas: 
e-xi 
and 
e+xi 


x 
represents 
the 
space 
covered. 



One 
dimension 
has 
two 
directions. 
But 
it 
has, 
two 
ways 
to 
go 
over 
them, 
from 
inside 
to 
outside 
and 
from 
outside 
to 
inside, 
in 
both 
ways. 
That 
means 
4 



ways 
to 
do 
it. 



If 
we 
have 
a 
circular 
dimension, 
we 
have 
2π 
radians 
in 
each 
revolution, 
and 
4x2π 
radians=8π 
radians 
in 
those 
4 
revolutions. 



The 
space 
covered 
in 
one 
dimension 
would 
be: 
x=8πr; 
x1=-8πr. 
And 
the 
formula 
for 
each 
dimension 
would 
be: 
e8πri 
and 
e-8πri 
That 
would 
be 
in 
any 
dimension, 
and 
so, 
we 
need 
to 
include 
n 
(number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions) 
in 
the 
formula. 
The 
formula 
would 
be 
completed 
with 
the 
relation: 
e+8πrin 
and 
e-8πrin. 
R 
represents 
radians 
in 
polar 
equations, 
equivalent 
to 
360/2π=57.29577951° 
and 
2πr=360°. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
the 
formulas 
are: 
e+24πri 
and 
e-24πri 



29. 
Division 
and 
formulas 
of 
both 
scales 
In 
the 
order 
to 
put 
only 
real 
exponents 
we 
need 
to 
transform 
them, 
using 
the 
most 
important 
formulas 
in 
Physics, 
because 
they 
are 
practical 
for 
any 
Universe, 
even 
with 
different 
spatial 
dimensions. 
(E=mc2 
is 
only 
true 
in 
a 
Universe 
with 
3 
spatial 
dimension 
+ 
1 
time). 


eπi+1=0 


eπi=-1 


e2πi-1=0 


e2πi=1 


e(2πi)n=+1 


eπri=isin 
πr+cos 
πr=-1 


e2πri=isin 
2πr+cos 
2πr=+1 


e24πri=isin 
24πr+cos 
24πr=+1 


e-24πri=isin 
-24πr+cos 
-24πr=+1 


We 
need 
to 
use 
angles, 
whose 
sine 
is 
zero, 
in 
order 
to 
eliminate 
i 
and 
to 
have 
a 
real 
equation; 
and 
it 
is 
obtained 
by 
using 
the 
angle 
of 
180°, 
or 
multiples 
of 
it. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
need 
at 
least 
a 
complete 
revolution, 
2πr 
(360°). 
The 
angle 
used 
in 
our 
dimension 
is 
4320° 
or 
12 
(2πr), 
in 
each 
limit. 
And 
it 
is 
real, 
when 
the 
imaginary 
part 
of 
the 
equation 
disappears 
because 
sine 
of 
4320° 
is 
zero, 
and 
so: 


e12(2πri)=isin 
24πr+cos 
24πr=+1 


1= 
0 
+ 
1 


e24πri=cos 
24πr 


=cos 
4320°=1 


and 
e-24πri 
= 
cos 
-24πr 
= 
cos 
-4320°=1 


If 
4320° 
and 
-4320° 
are 
symmetric, 
that 
means 
12 
revolutions 
in 
the 
minimum 
scale 
and 
12 
revolutions 
in 
the 
maximum 
scale; 
we 
can 
divide 
them 
in 
cycles 
of 
4 
revolutions 
each, 
a 
convenient 
form 
that 
we 
will 
use 
later, 
when 
we 
talk 
about 
the 
families 
of 
particles. 



30. 
Approximate 
values 
of 
the 
Universes' 
limits 
The 
value 
of 
4320° 
determines 
e24πi 
= 
cos 
4320° 
= 
1, 
and 
e-24πi= 
cos 
-4320° 
=1, 
and 
so, 
e24πi.e-24πi=1, 
but 
also, 
(e24π.e-24π)=e0=1. 
We 
have 
a 
linear 
result 
too, 
and 
approximate 
values 
of 
maximum 
and 
minimum. 
The 
linear 
result 
is 
obtained 
considering 
the 
factor 
πr, 
with 
its 
numerical 
value. 
π 
is 
3.1415926535… 
and 
r=1 
(the 
radius). 


Then, 
if 
we 
use 
numerical 
values, 
we 
have: 


e+24π= 
e24(3.1415926535) 
=e75.39822369 


(Maximum 
approximate):(5.559458495 
x 
1032 
)cm 


e-24π=e-24(3.1415926535) 
=e-75.39822369 


(Minimum 
approximate):(1.798736335 
x 
10-33)cm 
The 
differences 
with 
the 
correct 
values, 
depends 
on 
a 
correction 
factor 
that 
we 
will 
detail 
in 
the 
next 
section. 



31. 
Extradimensional 
geometry. 
Spatial 
correction 
factors 
Extradimensional 
geometry 
influences 
the 
size 
of 
the 
minimum 
and 
the 
maximum 
limits, 
making 
both 
decrease. 
However, 
its 
influence 
is 
not 
so 
big 
as 
the 
Superstring 
theory 
desires. 
The 
geometrical 
size 
and 
shape 
of 
the 
extra 
dimensions 
have 
no 
important 
effect 
on 
the 
properties 
of 
our 
Universe, 
only 
their 
number. 
The 
lengths 
are 
totally 
different 
between 
them, 
with 
insignificant 
direct 
physical 
influence. 
For 
that 
reason, 
we 
can 
only 
draw 
them 
in 
logarithmical 
space. 
In 
the 
minimum 
limit, 
the 
correction 
factor 
is 
n/28, 
where 
n 
is 
the 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions 
of 
any 
Universe; 
and 
28, 
the 
sum 
of 
spatial 
dimensions 
in 
a 
modulus 
with 
7 
spatial 
dimensions 
(+1 
time). 
In 
the 
maximum 
limit, 
the 
correction 
factor 
is 
n/28 
x 
2n=2n2/28, 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
each 
dimension 
is 
extended 
in 
2n 
ways. 
In 
Planck 
length, 
it 
is 
n/28 
x 
1, 
because 
in 
Planck 
length, 
there 
is 
no 
expansion. 
Planck 
length 
is 
the 
only 
measure, 
nothing 
longer, 
nothing 
shorter. 



32. 
String 
theory 
Definitively, 
many 
physicists 
have 
exerted 
a 
lot 
of 
effort 
into 
String 
theory, 
and 
the 
more 
recent, 
M 
Theory, 
since 
1968. 
They 
have 
spent 
time, 
money, 
even 
their 
whole 
careers. 
Those 
theories 
are 
mathematically 
correct, 
but 
they 
need 
their 
corresponding 
physical 
adjustment. 
Treating 
results 
of 
worlds 
with 
10 
(or 
eleven) 
and 
26 
dimensions, 
and 
putting 
them 
in 
our 
Universe 
of 
4 
dimensions 
(3+1) 
is 
not 
necessarily 
correct. 
Nevertheless, 
there 
are 
a 
vast 
amount 
of 
results 
completely 
correct 
in 
String 
theory 
that 
need 
to 
be 
rescued. 
In 
that 
way, 
works 
wouldn't 
have 
been 
realized 
in 
vain, 
but 
physicists 
in 
String 
Theory 
need 
to 
open 
their 
minds 
and 
find 
another 
way; 
in 
most 
planifications 
there’s 
always 
plan 
B. 
We 
acknowledge, 
physicists 
are 
the 
smartest 
people 
in 
Earth, 
but 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
leave 
behind 
the 
“protocols” 
and 
to 
write 
new 
ideas. 
Remember, 
as 
Einstein 
said: 
"Imagination 
is 
more 
important 
than 
knowledge." 
But 
physicists 
have 
both. 
They 
need 
to 
put 
both 
of 
them 
in 
action. 
Notwithstanding, 
a 
physicist, 
Lee 
Smolin, 
indicated, 
“String 
Theory 
now 
has 
such 
a 
dominant 
position 
in 
the 
Academy, 
that 
is 
practically 
career 
suicide 
for 
young 
theoretical 
physicists 
not 
to 
join 
the 
field”. 
But 
progress 
begins 
with 
change. 
The 
superpartners, 
need 
to 
increase 
their 
range 
of 
action; 
from 
-12kπ, 
in 
electroweak 
length, 
to 
-24kπ, 
in 
Planck 
length; 
or 
to 
turn 
into 
heavy 
partners; 
The 
Calabi-Yau 
and 
other 
new 
concepts 
that 
we 
will 
mention 
in 
next 
sections, 
also 
need 
to 
be 
revised; 
but 
it’s 
necessary 
to 
find 
other 
correct 
results 
of 
the 
String 
theory 
and 
to 
write 
them 
in 
a 
complete 
summary. 
This 
would 
be 
the 
form, 
for 
all 
the 
works 
realized, 
to 
give 
their 
fruits. 
The 
correct 
results 
are: 
to 
eliminate 
sub-Planck 
distances 
and 
distance 
0, 
correct 
the 
Standard 
Model 
and 
the 
General 
Theory 
of 
Relativity, 
that 
are 
fundamental; 
Planck 
length; 
Planck 
mass; 
divide 
by 
√(8π) 
to 
obtain 
the 
gravitational 
mass; 
to 
fix 
the 
dimensions 
of 
string 
in 
10 
and 
26; 
to 
consider 
a 
multidimensional 
Universe, 
instead 
of 
our 
4 
known 
dimensions 
(3+1); 
to 
find 
the 
correct 
point 
of 
union 
of 
the 
3 
non-
gravitational 
forces; 
the 
elimination 
of 
point 
particles; 
the 
application 
of 
mirror 
symmetry 
and 
T-symmetry; 
the 
existence 
of 
at 
least 
3 
Higgs 
bosons 
instead 
of 
1; 
the 
existence 
of 
quantum 
gravity, 
only 
exact 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 



the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
quantum 
mechanics 
act; 
the 
complete 
unification 
of 
forces 
in 
determined 
moments 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe; 
the 
compactification 
of 
space, 
the 
mass 
scales: 
Planck 
mass; 
gravitational 
scale, 
electroweak 
scale; 
the 
grand 
unification 
scale 
(mGUT=1016.1±0.3) 
GeV); 
S, 
T, 
and 
U 
dualities; 
string 
tension, 
D 
branes; 
E8 
x 
E8 
symmetry; 
Lie 
and 
superconformal 
algebras, 
CPT 
symmetry, 
moduli 
spaces; 
null 
state, 
p-branes, 
zero-point 
energy, 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
very 
important 
issues; 
to 
rescue 
them, 
unaltered, 
or 
with 
some 
adaptations. 



33. 
Exact 
values 
of 
our 
Universe's 
limits 
We 
can 
obtain 
the 
exact 
values 
of 
the 
limits 
(Maximum 
and 
minimum) 
by 
applying 
both 
factors, 
and 
so, 
we 
have 
the 
general 
formulas. 


Maximum: 
e+8πn-(2n^2)⁄28=e24π-18⁄

28=e+74.75536654 
= 
2.923096699 
x 
1032 
cm 
⁄28=e-24π-3⁄

Minimum: 
=e-8πn-n 
28=e-75.50536654 
= 
1.615979906 
x 
10-33 
cm 
Because 
Planck 
length 
is 
used 
to 
name 
the 
minimum 
limit 
in 
our 
Universe 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
each 
Universe 
has 
different 
minimum 
limits 
in 
its 
corresponding 
dimension; 
we 
will 
use 
Planck 
length 
to 
name 
them, 
so 
we 
would 
have: 
λp0, 
λp1, 
λp2 
, 
λp3, 
λp4 
, 
λp5, 
λp6, 
λp7. 
We 
can 
use 
the 
formulas 
for 
other 
Universes 
with 
different 
dimensions, 
and 
find 
their 
fundamental 
values. 
We 
will 
detail 
them 
in 
a 
further 
table. 



34. 
Time 
correction 
factor 
The 
former 
correction 
factor 
is 
a 
spatial 
factor, 
but 
there 
exists 
a 
time– 
correction 
factor 
too. 
We 
know 
the 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions 
of 
a 
modulus 
with 
7 
Universes, 
with 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4, 
5, 
6, 
and 
7 
dimensions. 
It 
is 
28 
(the 
sum 
of 
them); 
but 
it 
has 
an 
additional 
Universe, 
with 
zero 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
one 
time, 
in 
order 
to 
complete 
a 
modulus. 
It 
has 
an 
additional 
correction 
factor, 
considering 
time 
is 
not 
zero 
space. 
It 
is 
-1 
space. 


According 
to 
that, 
the 
time 
correction 
factor 
is 
not 
zero, 
it 
is 
–(-1/28)= 
+ 
1/28 
in 
the 
minimum 
limit; 
and 
in 
the 
maximum 
limit, 
it 
is: 
-2(-12)/28 
= 
-2/28. 
And 
so, 
the 
formulas 
with 
both 
factors 
included 
would 
be, 


⁄28+1⁄28 


Co-minimum 
limit: 
e-8πn-n 


⁄28 


Co-maximum 
limit: 
e+8πn-2n^2/28-2 
In 
our 
Universe, 
it 
would 
be: 
Co-minimum 
limit: 
e-75.46955226 
= 
1.674736453 
x 
10-33 
cm 
Co-maximum 
limit: 
e+74.68393797 
= 
2.721586538 
x 
1032 
cm

Order 
of 
the 
cycle 
of 
the 
Universes 
As 
we 
can 
observe, 
both 
results 
are 
not 
minimum 
neither 
maximum 
limits, 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
we 
didn’t 
use 
them 
when 
we 
obtained 
the 
real 
limits: 
real 
minimum 
limit 
is 
smaller 
and 
real 
maximum 
limit 
is 
longer, 
as 
we 
calculated 
before, 
without 
the 
use 
of 
the 
time 
correction 
factor. 
Why 
do 
those 
correction 
factors 
(time 
factors) 
exist, 
if 
they 
are 
not 
necessary? 
The 
answer 
is 
simple: 
because 
they 
are 
fundamental 
in 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
reason, 
why 
our 
Universe 
has 
4 
extended 
dimensions 
(in 
space-time), 
is 
because 
it 
was 
developed 
in 
order, 
1, 
2, 
and 
3 
dimensional 
Universe. 
And 
later, 
it 
will 
be 
developed 
in 
5, 
6, 
7, 
and 
8. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
Universe 
with 
one 
dimension, 
in 
space-time, 
was 
the 
first 
Universe, 
and 
it 
was 
the 
simplest. 
The 
Universe 
normally 
begins 
from 
a 
simpler 
to 
a 
more 
complex 
entity. 
It's 
more 
logical 
to 
suppose 
that 
it 
began 
from 
1, 
2, 
3, 
and 
4 
than 
to 
break 
10 
into 
4 
and 
6. 
And 
in 
the 
first 
space-time 
Universe, 
the 
correction 
factor 
is 
indispensable. 



36. 
Evolution 
of 
the 
first 
Universe 
due 
to 
time 
correction 
factor 
One 
dimension, 
in 
space-time, 
means 
zero 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
1 
time. 
If 
we 
use 
the 
general 
formulas 
in 
the 
one 
dimensional 
Universe, 
zero 
space 
+ 
1 
time, 
we 
obtain: 


Miminum 
limit: 
e0=1 
Maximum 
limit: 
e0=1 
(Without 
the 
time 
correction 
factors) 


With 
these 
results, 
there 
is 
no 
evolution, 
no 
movement, 
nothing; 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
a 
stopped 
space-time, 
a 
consigularity 
with 
no 
change. 
The 
Universes, 
in 
their 
evolution, 
need 
to 
expand 
or 
contract. 
If 
not, 
there 
would 
be 
almost 
nothing 
at 
all. 
Vanished 
time 
and 
space 
would 
be 
like 
a 
speck, 
with 
no 
change 
and 
with 
no 
spatial 
measure 
either. 
The 
development 
of 
the 
dimensions 
would 
be 
canceled, 
and 
so, 
the 
Universes 
would 
be 
too. 
The 
Universe 
would 
remain 
the 
same 
“forever”. 
However, 
if 
we 
include 
the 
time 
correction 
factor, 
we 
would 
have: 


Planck 
length: 
e0+1/28=e1/28=1.036359701 
cm 
(normally 
minimum 
length, 
and 
now, 
first 
length) 
and 
Final 
length: 
e0-2/28= 
e-2/28=0.931062779 
cm 


This 
change 
produces 
a 
contraction 
of 
Universe 
1, 
decreasing 
its 
length 
and 
producing 
the 
necessary 
evolution; 
starting 
cycles 
of 
the 
Universes, 
alternatively 
shrinking 
and 
stretching; 
which 
will 
be 
explained 
later. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
time 
correction 
factor, 
a 
quantum 
cosmological 
principle, 
produces 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universes 
and 
starts 
the 
system, 
the 
way 
they 
use 
to 
keep 
evolving. 
But 
which 
is 
the 
use 
of 
these 
time 
factors 
in 
the 
next 
dimensional 
Universes? 
As 
we 
showed, 
these 
factor 
are 
useless 
in 
order 
to 
fix 
real, 
maximum 
and 
minimum 
limits 
in 
Universes, 
with 
space-time 
dimensions 
bigger 
that 
one, 



but 
they 
are 
useful 
to 
fix 
the 
vanishing 
of 
time 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
any 
Universe. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
from 
Planck 
length 
to 
1.674736453 
x 
10-33 
cm, 
and 
after 
2.721586538 
x 
1032 
cm 
to 
maximum 
length, 
time 
is 
converted 
into 
space. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
general 
principle, 
when 
at 
Planck 
Length, 
or 
close 
to 
it 
(longer); 
before 
the 
collapse 
of 
our 
Universe, 
or 
close 
to 
it 
(shorter); 
time 
is 
converted 
into 
space, 
like 
we 
explained 
before. 



37. 
Differences 
between 
space, 
time, 
and 
dimension 
When 
we 
talk 
about 
the 
first 
Universe, 
with 
one 
dimension 
in 
space–time, 
(zero 
spatial 
dimension 
+ 
1 
time), 
we 
need 
to 
distinguish 
between 
space, 
time 
and 
dimension. 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
time 
zero 
and 
space 
zero 
don’t 
exist, 
but 
what 
happens 
with 
dimension 
zero? 
Time 
dimension 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist 
because 
every 
entity, 
including 
Universes, 
always 
need 
one 
time 
dimension 
(time 
and 
its 
flow). 
Spatial 
dimension 
zero 
is 
possible 
to 
exist, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
case 
of 
the 
first 
Universe. 
Space 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist, 
but 
spatial 
dimension 
zero 
can 
exist 
when 
space 
is 
not 
developed, 
and 
an 
independent 
axis, 
or 
direction 
of 
space, 
is 
not 
formed. 
According 
to 
that, 
in 
all 
the 
development 
of 
that 
Universe 
(0 
space 
+1 
time), 
there 
is 
no 
length 
longer 
that 
Planck 
length. 
The 
temporal 
axis 
is 
fixed, 
and 
according 
to 
the 
flow 
of 
time, 
time 
is 
developed. 
And 
so, 
one-dimensional 
Universe, 
in 
space-time, 
means: 
zero 
spatial 
dimension 
and 
a 
non-zero 
time 
dimension. 
Planck 
limit 
in 
this 
Universe 
is 
longer 
than 
any 
other 
measure, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
Macrocosmos 
and 
Microcosmos 
are 
united 
just 
like 
a 
hook 
(hook 
union), 
and 
they 
are 
not 
separated 
entities. 
We 
can 
explain 
that 
with 
a 
diagram. 




This 
system 
is 
utilized 
by 
Nature 
in 
different 
opportunities; 
like 
in 
the 
scales 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
of 
matter 
(we 
can 
demonstrate 
that, 
even 
with 
the 
known 
experimental 
masses 
of 
all 
the 
heaviest 
particles 
of 
matter 
known 
today); 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
(that 
produce 
mass) 
and 
the 
macrocosmos; 
the 
relation 
among 
Universes 
with 
different 
dimensions; 
the 
union 
of 
the 
dimensional 
moduli, 
the 
union 
of 
the 
dimensional 
packages, 
etc. 



38. 
Frontier 
dimensional 
Universes 
All 
the 
different 
dimensional 
Universes 
have 
2 
frontier 
Universes; 
one 
smaller 
and 
one 
larger. 
Our 
Universe 
with 
4 
dimensions 
(3 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time) 
has 
a 
direct 
relation 
with 
5 
dimensions 
(4 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time) 
and 
3 
dimensions 
(2 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time). 
With 
more 
dimensions, 
the 
speed 
of 
“light” 
is 
faster 
and 
the 
gravity 
is 
lighter. 
With 
fewer 
dimensions, 
the 
speed 
of 
“light” 
is 
slower 
and 
the 
gravity 
is 
stronger. 
The 
speed 
of 
light 
is 
constant, 
only 
in 
the 
same 
dimensional 
Universe, 
and 
it's 
the 
maximum 
limit 
for 
matter. 
Our 
cosmic 
space 
is 
always 
faster 
than 
light. 
When 
matter 
is 
almost 
reaching 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
the 
particles 
acquire 
some 
properties 
of 
the 
next 
Universe, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
particles 
act 
as 
a 
duality, 
in 
our 
Universe, 
as 
particles 
and 
as 
waves. 
The 
Universe 
with 
5 
dimensions 
(4+1) 
is 
a 
Universe 
of 
“waves”. 
When 
gravity 
is 
increasing, 
we 
are 
reaching 
the 
Universe 
of 
3 
dimensions 
(2+1), 
a 
Universe 
of 
“shadows” 
(without 
shadows). 
The 
center 
of 
black 
holes 
and 
the 
Big 
Bang 
have 
the 
maximum 
compression, 
or 
maximum 
gravity 
density, 
and 
have 
Planck 
length 
in 
the 
3 
dimensions. 
When 
the 
maximum 
speed 
of 
light 
or 
maximum 
gravitational 
field 
is 
reached, 
time 
slows 
down. 
The 
Theory 
of 
Relativity 
becomes 
important 
when 
the 
system 
is 
moving 
close 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
or 
in 
an 
intense 
gravitational 
field. 
In 
the 
case 
close 
to 
speed 
of 
light, 
quantum 
mechanics, 
explain 
the 
duality 
of 
particles 
and 
waves. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
considerably 
increasing 
a 
gravitational 
field, 
quantum 
cosmological 
will 
explain 
another 
duality, 
of 
matter 
and 
“shadows”; 
but 
both 
have 
similar 
effects 
with 
time 
dilation 
and 
Lorentz 
contraction. 
We 
need 
to 
relate 
our 
Universe 
with 
the 
other 
two 
Universes. 
Dimensional 
analysis 
and 
dimensional 
synthesis 
are 
very 
important, 
at 
least 
to 
accept 
its 
existence. 
We 
will 
develop 
this 
idea 
further. 



39. 
Minimum 
wedge 
of 
dimensional 
modulus 
The 
problem 
with 
this 
relation, 
between 
the 
frontier 
dimensional 
Universes, 
acquires 
a 
difficulty, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
this 
helps 
to 
understand 
why 
10 
is 
the 
dimension 
of 
the 
string. 
We 
explained 
it 
before, 
from 
a 
mathematical 
perspective, 
but 
now 
we 
will 
explain 
it 
from 
a 
physical 
standpoint. 
The 
one-dimensional 
space-time 
(0+1) 
Universe 
can't 
have 
a 
frontier 
with 
zero-dimensional 
(0+0) 
Universe, 
but 
it 
can 
have 
one 
with 
the 
other, 
Universe 
2(1+1). 
Zero 
dimensional 
space-time 
doesn’t 
exist 
physically, 
because 
it 
is 
absolute 
and 
infinite. 
Besides 
that, 
zero 
dimensional 
space-time 
can't 
have 
a 
frontier 
because 
it's 
unlimited. 
For 
that 
reason, 
space-zero 
and 
time 
zero 
don’t 
exist, 
at 
least 
physically. 
The 
frontiers 
of 
the 
one-dimensional 
space-time 
Universe 
are 
2 
and 
8, 
forming 
the 
first 
dimensional 
modulus. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
time 
correction 
factor 
is 
very 
useful, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
one-dimensional 
Universe, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
eight-
dimensional 
Universe. 
Remember, 
vanished 
time 
acts 
in 
the 
beginning 
and 
at 
the 
end 
(or 
close 
to 
them) 
of 
our 
Universe. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
effect 
is 
different, 
but 
it's 
the 
same 
concept. 
Nature 
uses 
the 
same 
rules, 
but 
realizes 
different 
works, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
repeat 
exactly 
the 
same 
thing, 
but 
maintaining 
the 
rhythm. 
Nature 
is 
very 
versatile, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
efficient. 
The 
time 
correction 
factor 
is 
also 
more 
important 
in 
the 
one 
and 
eight-dimensional 
Universes, 
the 
first 
and 
the 
last 
one. 
But 
even 
being 
the 
same 
concept, 
there 
exists 
a 
minimal, 
but 
crucial 
difference. 
The 
time 
correction 
factors: 
e+1/28 
and 
e-2/28 
are 
important 
factors 
especially 
in 
the 
one 
dimensional 
Universe 
(0 
space 
+ 
1 
time); 
but 
also 
in 
the 
8th 
Universe 
by 
being 
the 
term 
that 
they 
need 
to 
be 
complete. 
In 
another 
words, 
the 
one 
space-time 
Universe 
is 
also 
the 
necessary 
wedge 
to 
finish 
the 
8th 
Universe. 
A 
minimum 
wedge, 
different 
in 
each 
limit, 
whose 
value 
is: 


Planck 
Length: 
e+1/28 
= 
e+0.035714285 
= 
1.036359701cm 
and 
final 
length: 
e-2/28 
= 
e-0.071428571 
= 
0.931062779 
cm 



In 
logarithmic, 
exponential, 
or 
physical 
terms, 
it 
is 
the 
same 
thing: 
a 
minimum 
term 
or 
minimum 
wedge. 
But 
in 
arithmetical 
terms, 
the 
difference 
is 
notable 
and 
remarkably 
efficient. 
We 
will 
see 
it 
in 
the 
next 
section. 



40. 
Differences 
between 
logarithmical 
and 
arithmetical 
values 
We 
can 
see 
the 
difference 
with 
the 
next 
simple 
calculations: 



Nature 
is 
always 
efficient, 
and 
uses 
the 
same 
rules, 
obtaining 
many 
convenient, 
but 
different 
results; 
using 
minimal 
differences. 
We 
will 
see 
another 
example 
in 
the 
next 
sections. 



41. 
Reason 
to 
complete 
8th 
Universe 
with 
9th 
Universe 
The 
reason 
that 
we 
need 
to 
complete 
the 
8th 
dimensional 
Universe 
with 
the 
1st 
dimensional 
Universe 
(that 
it 
is, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
time 
correction 
factor), 
is 
to 
avoid 
completing 
the 
8th 
Universe 
by 
its 
own, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
continuing 
to 
the 
9th 
dimension, 
without 
increasing 
the 
size 
and 
energy 
unnecessarily, 
while 
continue 
increasing 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
Universe. 
But 
as 
the 
1st 
has 
its 
place 
in 
both 
moduli, 
remaining 
as 
space 
in 
the 
first 
and 
in 
the 
second 
modulus, 
an 
so, 
a 
new 
one-dimensional 
Universe, 
of 
a 
second 
modulus, 
acts 
as 
the 
necessary 
wedge, 
completing 
and 
using 
the 
same 
system, 
to 
tie 
both 
modulus, 
like 
a 
hook. 
And 
so, 
the 
nine-dimensional 
Universe 
of 
the 
second 
modulus 
completes 
the 
8th 
Universe 
of 
first 
modulus; 
ties 
them 
together, 
and 
acts 
like 
the 
1st 
Universe 
of 
the 
second 
modulus, 
repeating 
the 
same 
process, 
with 
different 
results 
and 
effects. 
And 
so, 
the 
nine-dimensional 
Universe 
is 
also 
an 
(8)+1 
Universe. 



42. 
10th 
Universe 
as 
a 
string 
Universe 
In 
consequence, 
the 
following 
Universe, 
10th, 
will 
be 
fundamentally 
a 
string 
Universe. 
The 
10th 
Universe 
would 
be 
only 
a 
(8)+2 
Universe. 
We 
know 
the 
Universe 
2 
(1+1), 
considering 
1 
spatial 
dimension 
plus 
one 
temporal 
dimension. 
It 
is 
the 
first 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
strings; 
the 
10th 
would 
be 
the 
second 
term 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
string 
Universes. 
Superstring 
Theory, 
with 
its 
entire 
mathematical 
framework, 
“teaches 
us 
that 
10 
and 
26” 
are 
dimensions 
of 
strings. 
The 
10th 
Universe 
(8)+2, 
with 
two 
moduli, 
needs 
a 
new 
symmetry, 
one 
that 
introduces 
new 
spins, 
because 
the 
particles 
need 
to 
move 
in 
both 
moduli. 
For 
example, 
the 
photon 
has 
spin 
1, 
a 
complete 
revolution 
in 
one 
modulus. 
With 
two 
moduli, 
it 
needs 
two 
revolutions, 
one 
in 
each 
modulus; 
and 
in 
that 
moment, 
its 
spin 
would 
be 
1/2. 
It's 
easy 
to 
show 
that 
by 
subtracting 
1/2 
to 
the 
spin 
of 
particles 
or 
forces 
it 
can 
be 
demonstrated 
that 
superpartners 
are 
absolutely 
necessary 
in 
a 
10 
dimensional 
Universe 
(8)+2. 
The 
third 
term 
of 
the 
sequence 
is 
26. 
Considering 
that 
nature 
follows 
the 
easiest 
path; 
going 
to 
26 
is 
easier 
in 
a 
counterclockwise 
direction, 
and 
not 
in 
a 
clockwise 
one, 


wherethe10dimensions“live”,aswecanseeinthefigure.
In 
the 
10th 
dimensional 
Universe 
(8)+2, 
strings 
are 
the 
fundamental 
ingredients; 
but 
by 
having 
a 
complete 
modulus 
(8 
dimensions) 
it 
also 
contains 
other 
objects, 
with 
different 
dimensions 
but 
with 
a 
secondary 



activity 
(vibrating 
two 
spatial 
dimensions 
membranes 
or 
“shadows”; 
undulating 
three 
dimensional 
blobs 
(particles 
or 
three-branes); 
vibrating 
fourbranes 
(“waves”) 
(4+1) 
and 
a 
host 
of 
other 
numbers 
of 
branes; 
but 
in 
10 
dimensions, 
8+2(1+1), 
strings 
are 
the 
most 
important, 
or 
fundamental, 
ingredients. 
In 
that 
way, 
it 
is 
convenient 
to 
use 
the 
same 
terminology 
used 
in 
superstring 
theory 
(or 
string 
theory 
for 
short). 
A 
one 
–brane 
is 
a 
string; 
a 
twobrane 
is 
a 
membrane; 
a 
three-brane 
is 
a 
particle. 
In 
general, 
n-brane 
has 
n-
extended 
spatial 
dimensions. 
In 
any 
case, 
we 
need 
to 
add 
1 
time 
dimension 
to 
determine 
the 
complete 
number 
of 
the 
space-time 
Universe. 
Zero-brane 
can 
be 
called 
a 
monopole, 
or 
zero 
extended 
spatial 
dimensions, 
or 
1, 
if 
we 
include 
time 
(in 
this 
case, 
time 
would 
be 
the 
only 
extended 
dimension). 



43. 
Membranes 
in 
M-theory. 
Odd 
and 
even 
numbered 
Universes 
The 
Superstring 
Theory 
has 
5 
different 
types 
of 
itself; 
but 
from 
the 
second 
superstring 
revolution 
emerged 
a 
new 
theory: 
M-theory, 
involving 
eleven 
space-time 
dimensions, 
although 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
its 
development 
and 
with 
many 
doubts, 
yet. 
Are 
membranes 
its 
fundamental 
ingredients? 
The 
answer 
is 
definitively, 
yes. 
According 
to 
the 
former 
sections, 
11 
dimensions 
mean 
8+3(2+1), 
where 
3 
is 
two 
spatial 
dimensions, 
or 
membranes, 
plus 
one 
temporal 
dimension. 


In 
eleven 
dimensions, 
it 
is 
feasible 
to 
see 
all 
the 
different 
characteristics, 
or 
differences, 
of 
a 
world 
of 
10 
dimensions. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
when 
we 
immediately 
see 
every 
drawing 
in 
a 
flat 
sheet 
of 
paper, 
using 
the 
third 
dimension 
(one 
extra 
dimension) 
or 
to 
identify 
five 
completely 
different 
armies, 
in 
a 
field 
of 
battle, 
from 
a 
hilltop. 
M-Theory 
using 
11 
dimensions 
can 
visualize 
the 
five 
string 
theories 
of 
10, 
as 
a 
part 
of 
a 
unified 
single 
framework. 
This 
is 
physically 
understandable 
and 
mathematically 
possible. 
M-Theory, 
having 
a 
complete 
modulus 
of 
8, 
also 
contains 
strings, 
particles 
and 
other 
p-branes, 
but 
fundamentally 
they 
are 
all 
membranes. 
The 
sequence 
of 
M-theory 
would 
be: 
3,11,27,51,83,123,171, 
and 
227 
(this 
last 
term 
belonging 
to 
a 
second 
package); 
but 
even 
simplifying 
the 
five 
types 
of 
String 
theory, 
it 
couldn’t 
develop 
the 
beautiful 
mathematical 
consistence 
of 
strings. 
Universes 
with 
an 
even 
number 
of 
dimensions 
in 
space-time 
(or 
odd, 
in 
spatial 
dimensions) 
are 
more 
coherent 
and 
their 
evolutions 
form 
more 
developed 
Universes. 
Our 
Universe 
of 
4 
dimensions 
(3+1) 
is 
an 
example 
of 
it. 
The 
space-time 
Universes 
of 
2, 
4 
(ours), 
6, 
and 
8, 
and 
consequently, 
10, 
12, 
14, 
etc. 
dimensions 
are 
Universes 
in 
expansion. 
The 
space-time 
Universes 
1, 
3, 
5, 
7, 
9,11, 
13, 
etc. 
dimensions 
are 
Universes 
in 
contraction, 
a 
phenomenon 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
considered, 
because 
it 
is 
profoundly 
sensitive 
in 
wave 
propagation. 
It 
is 
easily 
shown 
that 
in 
a 



Universe 
with 
an 
odd 
number 
of 
space-time 
dimensions 
(or 
with 
an 
even 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions) 
a 
wave 
doesn´t 
propagate 
cleanly, 
presenting 
reverberation 
effects 
or 
disturbances; 
being 
impossible 
to 
transmit 
well-
defined 
signals. 
Growth 
and 
development 
requires 
efficient 
transmission 
and 
correctly 
processed 
information. 



44. 
Development 
of 
the 
12th 
space-time 
Universe 
We 
can 
develop 
the 
12th 
Universe 
(8) 
+ 
4(3+1), 
which 
would 
be 
the 
second 
term 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
our 
Universe 
and 
its 
corresponding 
dimensional 
worlds: 
4, 
12, 
28, 
52, 
84, 
124, 
172, 
and 
228 
(the 
last 
term 
belonging 
to 
a 
second 
dimensional 
package). 
All 
the 
packages 
are 
constituted 
by 
224 
dimensions 
(8x28). 
However, 
mathematicians 
don´t 
try 
to 
research 
about 
this 
sequence; 
because 
4th 
is 
our 
Universe, 
and 
12th, 
dimensionally 
speaking, 
will 
be 
the 
second 
in 
our 
sequence 
of 
Universes. 
The 
problem 
is 
that 
some 
physicists 
always 
insist 
to 
consider 
that 
our 
Universe 
is 
the 
only 
one. 
Calculations 
indicate 
that 
if 
all 
but 
four 
dimensions 
are 
curled 
up, 
a 
system 
with 
more 
than 
11 
dimensions, 
will 
necessarily 
give 
rise 
to 
massless 
particles 
with 
spin 
greater 
than 
2, 
and 
experimental 
and 
theoretical 
results 
don´t 
permit 
this 
to 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe. 
But 
we 
insist, 
our 
Universe 
has 
4 
dimensions 
(3+1). 
All 
the 
other 
Universes 
of 
the 
same 
sequence 
are 
more 
complex 
Universes.

Formation 
of

Big 
crush. 
Alternating 
cycles. 
Speed 
of 
light 
Any 
modulus 
has 
8 
dimensions 
(7 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time). 
Our 
modulus 
(the 
first) 
contains 
8 
Universes: 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4, 
5, 
6, 
7, 
and 
8 
(in 
space-time) 
or 
0, 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4, 
5, 
6, 
and 
7 
(in 
space, 
considering 
that 
it's 
necessary 
to 
add 
time 
as 
an 
extra 
dimension 
in 
each 
of 
them). 
Time 
is 
not 
a 
separated 
entity, 
except 
in 
Universe 
1, 
where 
the 
temporal 
dimension 
is 
the 
only 
one 
that 
existed; 
and 
in 
the 
last 
Universe, 
where 
we 
need 
the 
time 
dimension 
factor 
to 
act 
as 
a 
wedge 
to 
complete 
Universe 
8. 
Because 
time 
acts 
as 
inverse 
space, 
we 
understood 
that 
the 
first 
Universe 
begins 
to 
shrink, 
and 
after 
that, 
the 
alternating 
process, 
shrink-stretch, 
follows, 
in 
the 
creation 
and 
collapse 
of 
Universes. 


a) 
Any 
Universe 
needs 
movement, 
and 
it's 
always 
expanding 
or 
contracting, 
except 
for 
a 
“while” 
where 
a 
complete 
new 
dimension 
appears; 
producing 
an 
inflection 
point; 
when 
the 
movement 
ceases, 
and 
changes 
direction. 
b) 
Between 
the 
collapse 
of 
a 
Universe, 
until 
a 
new 
dimension 
appears, 
there 
exists 
a 
time 
of 
fractal-dimension, 
where 
the 
new 
dimension 
begins 
to 
develop. 
The 
process 
is 
continuous, 
and 
increases 
step 
by 
step, 
until 
the 
new 
dimension 
completely 
appears, 
and 
the 
process 
is: 
New 
Universe= 
Former 
Universe 
+1 


c) 
During 
the 
development 
of 
a 
Universe, 
from 
the 
minimum 
limit 
to 
the 
maximum 
limit, 
or 
the 
other 
way 
around, 
the 
components 
inside 
them 
(in 
our 
case, 
matter 
and 
forces) 
have 
a 
speed 
limit, 
known 
as 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
permanently 
constant 
in 
each 
Universe, 
but 
different 
among 
them. 
Space 
moves 
faster 
than 
light, 
but 
it 
is 
an 
abstract 
entity. 

46. 
Hyperbolic 
function 
in 
the 
Universe. 
Cozero 
and 
cofinity 
When 
any 
Universe 
is 
developing, 
it 
maintains, 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
last 
event, 
a 
hyperbolic 
function. 
That 
means, 
that 
normally, 
a 
Universe 
will 
never 
stop, 
since 
hyperbolic 
means 
that 
even 
at 
“infinity”, 
movement 
will 
continue; 
Or 
in 
other 
words, 
that 
the 
Universe 
will 
expand 
forever, 
being 
“infinite” 
in 
extent; 
or 
in 
the 
case 
of 
contraction, 
it 
will 
contract 
forever, 
until 
it 
reaches 
a 
point 
of 
zero 
space 
(and 
zero 
time), 
or 
“singularity”. 


These 
absurdities, 
physically 
speaking, 
must 
be 
eliminated 
from 
Physics. 
Infinities 
and 
singularities 
don’t 
concern 
Physics 
and 
must 
be 
separated 
from 
all 
new 
Physics 
books. 
Old 
calculator 
machines 
tried 
to 
reach 
infinities. 
When 
dividing 
by 
zero, 
they 
began 
to 
change 
the 
result, 
increasing 
it 
continuously 
without 
stop. 
It 
was 
necessary 
to 
stop 
the 
machine, 
turn 
it 
off, 
or 
wait 
until 
the 
machine 
breaks, 
burns 
up, 
or 
puts 
itself 
out 
of 
order. 
Infinity 
is 
inaccessible! 
Today, 
new 
calculators, 
smaller, 
cheaper, 
and 
lighter, 
simply 
and 
immediately 
give 
the 
answer 
“E” 
(error). 


Why 
are 
physicists, 
the 
smartest 
people 
in 
our 
planet, 
still 
using 
infinities 
and 
singularities? 


If 
nobody 
has 
the 
slightest 
idea 
on 
how 
to 
find 
the 
solution 
to 
these 
irregularities, 
we 
could 
use 
other 
terms 
as 
substitutes: 
cofinity, 
cozero 
or 
cosingularity 
( 
, 
ø) 
where 
the 
line 
in 
the 
middle 
means 
limit; 
because 
vacuum 
with 
limits 
is 
physically 
correct, 
but 
vacuum 
without 
limits 
(∞, 
0) 
is 
not. 
These 
last 
terms 
are 
indistinguishable 
and 
impossible 
to 
reach. 
For 
example, 
we 
can 
say: 
“hyperbolic 
function 
expands 
longer 
than 
cofinity 
or 
contracts 
shorter 
than 
cozero 
space-time, 
or 
cosingularity”. 
This 
is 
at 
least 
digestible. 



47. 
Origin 
and 
destiny 
of 
our 
Universe 
In 
many 
Physics 
books, 
we 
read 
the 
cosmological 
principle: 
“It 
can 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
Universe 
can 
only 
have 
one 
of 
three 
forms: 
it 
can 
be 
'positively' 
curved 
like 
the 
surface 
of 
a 
ball 
and 
finite 
in 
extent, 
in 
that 
case, 
the 
Universe 
ultimately 
returns 
to 
its 
starting 
point; 
it 
can 
be 
'negatively' 
curved 
like 
a 
saddle 
and 
infinite 
in 
extent, 
or 
it 
can 
be 
'flat' 
and 
Infinite 
in 
extent. 
In 
both 
infinities, 
Universes 
never 
return 
to 
its 
starting 
point." 
First 
of 
all, 
we 
pointed 
out 
the 
former 
principle, 
for 
example 
how 
the 
infinities 
are 
used 
in 
Physics 
as 
any 
other 
quantity. 
But 
secondly, 
we 
need 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
origin 
and 
destiny 
of 
our 
Universe. 
The 
Universe 
cannot 
be 
flat, 
due 
to 
gravitational 
effects 
of 
matter 
and 
its 
corresponding 
distortion 
of 
space-time; 
it 
cannot 
be 
infinite, 
because 
space 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist, 
and 
so 
the 
Big 
Bang 
cannot 
be 
zero. 
It 
had 
a 
minimum 
limit 
and 
in 
consequence, 
it 
will 
have 
a 
maximum 
limit 
that 
will 
be 
its 
own 
cofinity. 
Moreover 
in 
a 
mathematical 
sense, 
the 
only 
way 
for 
the 
projection 
of 
a 
Universe 
to 
be 
completely 
flat, 
the 
Universe 
needs 
to 
begin 
at 
the 
center 
of 
all 
extended 
dimensions. 
Even 
without 
gravitational 
effects, 
space 
can 


neverbeflatiftheoriginwasnotzero.
The 
Universe 
is 
curved, 
even 
if 
it's 
now 
almost 
flat. 
The 
question 
then 
arises 
if 
the 
rate 
of 
expansion 
of 
our 
Universe 
has 
been 
slowing 
down 
(decelerating), 
due 
to 
the 
gravitational 
pull 
of 
matter 
in 
itself, 
causing 
the 
Universe 
to 
ultimately 
collapse 
back 
onto 
itself 
(elliptical 
Universe); 
or 
if 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
might, 
in 
fact, 
be 
speeding 
up 
(accelerating), 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
Universe 
will 
expand 
forever. 



48. 
Expansion 
of 
our 
Universe. 
Cosmological 
variable 
and 
dark 
energy 
We 
affirmed 
before 
that 
the 
tendency 
of 
our 
Universe 
(4th 
in 
space-time) 
is 
to 
expand. 
The 
existence 
of 
the 
cosmological 
variable 
(known 
as 
the 
cosmological 
constant), 
which 
never 
will 
be 
zero, 
is 
a 
fundamental 
factor 
that 
constitutes 
the 
“dark 
energy” 
necessary 
to 
expand 
the 
Universe. 
Moreover, 
we 
don’t 
know 
how 
gravity 
acts 
at 
enormous 
distances, 
and 
as 
we 
stated 
before, 
Universes 
with 
an 
even 
number 
of 
space-time 
dimensions 
(or 
odd 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions) 
always 
tend 
to 
expand. 
The 
question 
now 
would 
be: 
How 
does 
it 
expand? 
In 
a 
hyperbolic 
function, 
it 
will 
continuously 
expand, 
even 
after 
the 
maximum 
limit, 
or 
cofinite 
space, 
is 
reached. 
But 
when 
will 
it 
stop? 
Or 
in 
parabolic 
function, 
it 
will 
continuously 
expand 
until 
the 
maximum 
limit, 
or 
cofinite 
space, 
is 
reached. 
The 
calculations 
prove 
that 
the 
expansion 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
a 
hyperbolic 
function. 
The 
fact 
that 
a 
parallel 
Universe 
exists, 
coherently 
situated 
and 
perfectly 
distanced 
from 
ours, 
at 
2λp 
length 
(a 
Planck 
in 
each 
side), 
both 
with 
CPT 
symmetry 
(matter-antimatter; 
spin-opposite 
spin; 
and 
time-inverse 
time); 
impossible 
to 
contact 
it; 
completes 
the 
affirmation: 
our 
Universe 
is 
hyperbolic. 
We 
live 
in 
a 
Universe 
of 
3 
spatial-dimensions, 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
it 
forms 
a 
hyperboloid 
of 
two 
sheets, 
instead 
of 
a 
hyperboloid 
of 
one 
sheet, 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
both 
Universes 
are 
separated. 
In 
Mathematics, 
a 
hyperboloid 
is 
a 
quadric, 
a 
type 
of 
surface 
in 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
described 
by 
the 
equation 
(in 
case 
of 
hyperboloid 
of 
two 
sheets) 
x2/a2 
+y2/b2-z2/c2 
=-1. 
Where, 
at 
the 
pre-Big 
Bang, 
a, 
b, 
c, 
have 
Planck 
length 
each. 
The 
apparent 
space 
is 
(n.space-1) 
and 
so, 
we 
can 
visualize 
the 
hyperbola 
as 
the 
characteristic 
effect 
of 
the 
hyperbolic 
function 
in 
a 
space 
of 
two 
spatial 
dimensions, 
like 
a 
flat 
sheet 
of 
paper. 
When 
a 
hyperboloid 
is 
drawn, 
a 
key 
limitation 
is 
produced, 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
can 
only 
portray 
the 
curvature 
of 
a 
2 
dimensional 
plane 
of 
an 
actual 
3-dimensional 
space. 
In 
mathematics, 
the 
hyperbola 
has 
the 
equation: 
x2/a2 
-y2/b2 
=1 



We 
will 
work 
with 
these 
formulas 
later. 




49. 
Avoiding 
zero 
in 
Physics 
Any 
hyperbolic 
function 
expands 
“forever”. 
In 
mathematics 
we 
can 
use 
any 
value, 
invent 
scales, 
use 
zero, 
include 
zero 
at 
the 
origin 
of 
a 
scale 
of 
temperature, 
or 
space, 
or 
time. 
But 
this 
is 
completely 
different 
in 
physical 
terms. 
Humanity 
delayed 
its 
development, 
because 
they 
took 
a 
long 
time 
to 
use 
zero 
in 
mathematics. 
But 
using 
zero 
in 
Physics 
is 
another 
kind 
of 
backwardness. 
Zero 
in 
Physics 
produces 
singularities, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
infinities. 
Nature 
works 
with 
logarithmic 
scales, 
and 
log 
0 
and 
ln0 
don’t 
exist. 
For 
that 
reason, 
we 
need 
to 
explain 
“forever” 
in 
physical 
terms. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
parabolic 
Universe, 
the 
correction 
is 
easy: 
change 
infinity 
to 
cofinity. 
“The 
expansion 
will 
stop 
at 
cofinity”. 
But 
in 
hyperbolic 
functions, 
this 
change 
is 
not 
sufficient. 
It 
is 
the 
opportunity 
to 
change 
a 
wrong 
concept, 
for 
another 
one 
that 
is 
a 
little 
better, 
while 
we 
find 
the 
solution. 
“The 
expansion 
will 
not 
stop 
at 
cofinity; 
and 
it 
will 
keep 
expanding”. 
The 
correct 
answer 
that 
in 
some 
manner 
we 
have 
mentioned 
before 
in 
a 
superficial 
way 
is: 
“The 
expansion 
will 
not 
stop 
at 
cofinity. 
It 
will 
keep 
expanding, 
but 
the 
slope 
and 
rate 
of 
expansion 
will 
be 
slowed 
down 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
in 
a 
fractal 
way, 
step 
by 
step, 
forming 
a 
parabolic 
function, 
and 
it 
will 
stop 
at 
the 
new 
cofinity, 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
the 
4th 
spatial 
dimension. 
In 
that 
moment, 
the 
new 
Universe 
will 
stop 
expanding 
and 
start 
contracting 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
function. 
The 
4th 
spatial 
dimension 
Universe, 
5th 
in 
space-time 
(4+1), 
will 
not 
stop 
when 
it 
arrives 
to 
its 
minimum 
limit. 
It 
will 
keep 
contracting, 
starting 
another 
fractal 
dimension, 
also 
in 
a 
parabolic 
function 
as 
the 
previous 
one, 
until 
it 
stops 
at 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
completely 
new 
dimensional 
Universe, 
at 
the 
minimum 
limit 
of 
this 
new 
Universe. 
The 
new 
Universe, 
the 
5th 
(6th 
in 
space-time) 
begins 
to 
expand. 
This 
keeps 
going 
in 
an 
alternating 
cycle 
of 
expanding 
and 
contracting 
phases, 
with 
new 
spatial 
dimensions 
appearing 
after 
the 
collapse 
of 
a 
previous 
Universe. 



50. 
Fractal 
dimension. 
Big 
Crush 
We 
need 
to 
point 
out 
that 
every 
time 
a 
Universe 
“moves 
into 
a 
fractal-
dimension, 
there 
exists 
a 
contracting 
phase 
of 
the 
former 
dimension 
and 
an 
expanding 
or 
contracting 
phase 
of 
the 
new 
dimension. 
In 
both 
cases, 
in 
expanding 
and 
contracting 
Universes, 
apparently 
different, 
it 
is 
a 
similar 
process, 
an 
accelerating 
contraction 
phase 
of 
the 
former 
dimension, 
and 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
new 
dimension. 
The 
only 
difference 
is 
apparent, 
because 
in 
one 
case, 
space 
= 
R 
(in 
the 
maximum 
limit) 
an 
in 
the 
other 
case, 
space 
= 
1/R 
(in 
the 
minimum 
limit). 
For 
us 
this 
is 
a 
big 
difference, 
but 
for 
Nature, 
both 
are 
very 
similar. 
The 
concept 
is: 
While 
the 
minimum 
is 
shorter, 
the 
maximum 
is 
longer. 
We 
notice, 
the 
Universe 
expands 
or 
contracts. 
It 
never 
ceases 
to 
move, 
even 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension, 
in 
a 
fractal 
basis, 
until 
the 
new 
dimension 
completely 
appears. 
When 
the 
former 
Universe 
is 
contracting, 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
also 
begins 
to 
develop 
until 
a 
new 
Universe 
appears. 
Universes 
with 
an 
even 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions 
(or 
odd 
number 
in 
space-time) 
begin 
to 
contract, 
initiating 
in 
a 
Big 
Crunch, 
a 
reverse 
Big 
Bang. 
And 
in 
an 
inverse 
process, 
Universes 
with 
an 
odd 
number 
in 
spatial 
dimensions 
(or 
even 
number 
in 
space-time 
dimensions), 
like 
ours, 
begin 
to 
expand, 
initiating 
in 
a 
Big 
Bang. 
In 
both, 
until 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
Universe, 
there 
exists 
a 
suddenly, 
enormously 
accelerated 
phenomenon, 
destructive, 
almost 
instantaneous, 
and 
continuously 
accelerating 
exponentially 
in 
a 
fractal 
dimension. 
We 
will 
call 
it 
Big 
Crush. 
Our 
Universe 
had 
a 
Big 
Bang 
(3+1), 
but 
after 
that, 
a 
Big 
Crunch 
will 
appear 
(4+1); 
but 
between 
both 
of 
them, 
a 
Big 
Crush 
(3~4+1), 
will 
need 
to 
appear. 
We 
will 
detail, 
with 
simple 
explanations 
and 
drawing 
some 
sketches, 
the 
physical 
process 
about 
the 
formation 
of 
our 
first 
Universe 
modulus: 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4 
(ours), 
5, 
6, 
7, 
and 
8 
(space-time-dimensions), 
and 
after 
that, 
simple 
mathematical 
calculations 
about 
them. 
Just 
like 
we 
talked 
about 
Higgs 
bosons 
(4 
forces 
generating 
3 
Higgs 
bosons), 
8 
dimensions 
mean 
7 
fractal 
dimensions 
or 
Big 
Crushes. 



51. 
Dimensional 
modulus 
with 
maximum 
and 
minimum 
limits 
The 
figure 
shows 
a 
way 
to 
represent 
a 
modulus. 
Taking 
into 
account 
minimum 
limits, 
Universe 
8 
is 
the 
shortest 
and 
Universe 
1 
is 
the 
longest. 
With 
maximum 
limits, 
Universe 
8 
is 
the 
longest 
and 
1 
is 
the 
shortest. 
Both 
sequences 
are 
opposite. 


As 
we 
see 
in 
the 
figure, 
the 
sequence 
of 
fractal 
dimensions 
ends 
with 
the 
contraction 
7~8. 
Since 
8 
is 
the 
last 
term, 
the 
time 
correction 
factor 
acts 
and 
the 
dimension 
is 
not 
totally 
complete 
in 
its 
minimum 
length. 
8th 
expands, 
but 
it 
stops 
before 
it 
ends. 
In 
a 
symmetrical 
way, 
both 
length 
limits, 
(the 
last 
lengths 
of 
the 
moduli) 
need 
a 
corresponding 
wedge 
to 
close 
them, 
just 
as 
we 



mentioned 
before. 
The 
wedges 
are 
the 
9th 
dimension 
(8+1). 
The 
first 
modulus 
is 
completed, 
and 
we 
begin 
a 
second 
modulus, 
inserting 
the 
1st 
dimension 
of 
the 
second 
modulus 
(9th) 
like 
a 
hook. 



52. 
Time 
as 
the 
only 
dimension 
in 
the 
first 
Universe 
Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
Universes 
began 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
limited 
space; 
like 
a 
tiny 
cosmic 
“seed” 
in 
the 
form 
of 
quantum 
fluctuation 
of 
nothing. 
When 
space 
is 
limited, 
time 
needs 
to 
appear, 
but 
not 
as 
a 
separated 
unit. 
Space 
and 
time 
are 
always 
tied 
together 
in 
the 
development 
of 
any 
Universe, 
as 
space-time; 
but 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
at 
the 
end, 
time 
vanishes 
into 
space, 
and 
both 
integrate 
a 
single 
unit. 
Time 
is 
converted 
into 
space. 
In 
that 
way, 
even 
in 
the 
first 
Universe, 
even 
if 
only 
time 
is 
developed, 
we 
need 
to 
talk 
about 
space-time; 
zero-space 
and 
zero-time 
don´t 
exist 
in 
any 
physical 
Universe. 
All 
odd-numbered 
space-time 
Universes 
begin 
with 
their 
maximum 
limit, 
in 
a 
contraction 
phase 
or 
Big 
Crunch. 
The 
1st 
space-time 
Universe 
started 
that 
way, 
and 
so 
it 
could 
be 
named 
the 
first 
Big 
Crunch; 
but 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was 
the 
first 
dot 
ever 
produced, 
nothing 
existing 
before 
it, 
it's 
better 
to 
name 
it 
the 
first 
Big 
Bang, 
or 
with 
an 
intermediate 
term: 
The 
First 
Event. 


The 
1st 
Universe 
is 
completely 
different 
to 
the 
others. 
With 
no 
mass, 
no 
velocity, 
and 
no 
particles. 
In 
that 
Universe, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
divide 
space 
or 
time. 
Space-time 
exists, 
but 
with 
zero 
spatial 
dimension 
or 
zero-branes, 
ordinary 
geometry 
doesn’t 
function, 
and 
conventional 
notions 
of 
space 
and 
of 
distance 
between 
points 
melt 
away, 
producing 
a 
totally 
different 
landscape. 
The 
“points” 
are 
impossible 
to 
represent 
and 
are 
only 
abstract 
concepts. 
Time 
is 
the 
only 
dimension 
developed 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
there 
only 
exists 
a 
duality 
of 
time-inverse 
time, 
both 
like 
two 
parallel 
Universes. 
The 
common 
geometry, 
need 
to 
be 
replaced 
for 
a 
non-commutative 
geometry. 
In 
brief, 
in 
the 
1st 
Universe, 
space-time 
exists; 
spatial 
dimension 
is 
zero; 
temporal 
dimension 
is 
one. 



53. 
Dipoles 
and 
monopoles. 
Magnetic 
monopoles 
Unlike 
electricity, 
magnetic 
poles 
always 
seem 
to 
appear 
in 
pairs, 
north 
and 
south. 
In 
any 
bar 
magnet, 
one 
end 
will 
act 
as 
a 
positive 
pole 
and 
the 
other 
as 
a 
negative 
pole. 
If 
the 
bar 
is 
cut, 
new 
poles 
appear 
at 
the 
position 
of 
the 
cut, 
producing 
two 
magnets, 
each 
with 
a 
positive 
and 
a 
negative 
pole. 
All 
the 
objects 
in 
our 
Universe 
have 
3 
spatial 
dimensions. 
We 
could 
cut 
in 
any 
dimension, 
and 
we 
would 
obtain 
the 
same 
result. 


In 
our 
Universe, 
it's 
impossible 
to 
isolate 
a 
magnetic 
monopole. 


Are 
isolated 
magnetic 
poles 
forbidden 
in 
nature? 
The 
answer 
is: 
In 
our 
Universe, 
yes; 
but 
in 
the 
1st 
space-time 
Universe, 
the 
answer 
would 
be: 
no 
Magnetic 
monopoles 
don´t 
possess 
a 
complex 
internal 
structure 
like 
GUM 
predicted. 
They 
would 
be 
point 
particles, 
with 
no 
mass, 
impossible 
to 
divide. 
The 
1st 
space-time 
Universe 
has 
a 
parallel 
Universe, 
just 
like 
our 
Universe; 
but 
instead 
of 
matter-antimatter, 
it 
would 
be: 
monopole 
(+) 
and 
monopole 
(-); 
with 
time 
and 
inverse-time. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
1st 
space-time 
Universe 
has 
a 
parallel 
Universe. 
There 
is 
only 
a 
magnetic 
monopole 
in 
the 
whole 
Universe, 
with 
the 
opposite 
monopole 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
cosmos, 
its 
parallel 
Universe. 
Remember, 
time 
is 
inverse 
space, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
we 
have 
2 
Universes, 
one 
side 
by 
side. 
As 
Dirac 
investigated, 
with 
only 
one 
magnetic 
monopole 
in 
the 
whole 
Universe, 
electric 
charge 
is 
forced 
into 
every 
electron 
to 
be 
what 
it 
is, 
and 
in 
general 
terms, 
the 
charge 
of 
every 
particle 
is 
too. 


The 
1st 
Universe 
gives 
the 
basis 
fixing 
of 
the 
charges 
of 
our 
particles. 


As 
we 
know, 
there 
exist 
quantum 
connections, 
as 
a 
new 
kind 
of 
non-local 
relationships 
between 
elements 
that 
are 
distant 
from 
each 
other, 
even 
in 
a 
faster 
than 
light 
connection, 
or 
sometimes 
between 
our 
twin 
dimensional 
Universe. 



54. 
Positive 
and 
negative 
monopoles 
in 
the 
first 
Universe 
The 
Standard 
Big 
Bang 
theory 
predicts 
that 
a 
superabundance 
of 
monopoles 
would 
have 
been 
created 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe. 
This 
could 
be 
correct, 
if 
we 
consider 
an 
oscillating 
Universe. 
Monopoles 
were 
formed 
just 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe, 
the 
1st 
Universe. 
Other 
bizarre 
objects, 
known 
as 
“strings” 
and 
“sheets”, 
must 
also 
appear 
at 
the 
beginning. 
The 
problem, 
of 
how 
to 
get 
the 
Universe 
rid 
of 
these 
undesirable 
entities, 
has 
a 
simple 
answer 
using 
the 
multidimensional 
(gravitational) 
Universe. 
Strings 
were 
formed 
in 
the 
2nd 
(1+1) 
Universe; 
membranes, 
sheets, 
or 
domain 
walls 
in 
the 
3rd 
(2+1) 
Universe. 
Particles, 
our 
cosmic 
bricks, 
were 
formed 
in 
our 
4th 
(3+1) 
Universe. 
Inflation 
exists, 
but 
it 
doesn’t 
solve 
the 
nonexistence 
of 
magnetic 
monopoles; 
or 
real 
strings; 
or 
real 
membranes 
in 
our 
Universe, 
because 
even 
the 
enormous 
swelling 
of 
space 
never 
dilutes 
a 
measurable 
quantity 
to 
zero 
density. 
The 
answer 
is 
in 
the 
multidimensional 
Universe. 
All 
the 
matter 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
composed 
by 
particles, 
all 
with 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
1 
time. 
We 
live 
in 
4-dimensional 
Universe 
and 
in 
consequence, 
all 
the 
entities 
living 
in 
our 
Universe 
are 
plenty 
adapted 
to 
it. 



55. 
First 
event 
and 
measures 
The 
First 
Event 
is 
the 
appearance 
of 
space-time, 
contracting 
into 
a 
hyperbolic 
function 
at 
constant 
“speed 
of 
light”. 
Without 
any 
way 
to 
divide 
space 
into 
real 
separated 
entities, 
there 
is 
no 
possibility 
to 
have 
velocity 
and 
time. 
Nevertheless 
we 
can 
divide 
h/c, 
or 
the 
maximum 
limit 
by

speed

our 
Universe,

the

And 
use 
it 
as 
a 
constant 
time 
for 
all 
Universes. 
We 
can 
call 
it: 
Period. 


Just 
like 
we 
use 
the 
minimum 
limit, 
or 
Planck 
limit, 
dividing 
it 
by 
the 
constant 
speed 
of 
light 
to 
obtain 
what 
the 
physicists 
call: 
chronos.

In 
the 
First

the 
“speed” 
of

would 
be:

We 
can 
observe 
that 
the 
Period 
in 
this 
Universe 
is 
smaller 
than 
its 
chronos, 
and 
this 
is 
another 
affirmation 
to 
show 
that 
the 
1st 
Universe 
has 
zero 
spatial 
dimensions. 
Notwithstanding, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
clarify 
that 
the 
only 
real 
measures 
are 
the 
maximum 
and 
minimum 
limits; 
the 
other 
measures, 
even 
a 
“lot” 
of 
monopoles, 
are 
derived 
from 
our 
normal 
concepts 
in 
the 
other 
ordinary 
Universes. 



56. 
Entropy. 
Four 
laws 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
oscillating 
Universe 
An 
oscillating 
Universe, 
without 
change 
in 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
cannot 
exist. 


A 
fundamental 
problem 
would 
be 
that 
entropy 
always 
increases 
(and 
this 
is 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
time). 
Entropy 
is 
the 
thermodynamic 
property 
that 
measures 
the 
amount 
of 
disorder 
in 
the 
Universe. 
Even 
if 
the 
Universe 
was 
to 
contract 
and 
shrink 
back 
into 
a 
consingularity, 
entropy 
would 
continue 
to 
increase 
in 
the 
contracting 
phase 
of 
its 
cycles. 
This 
has 
a 
least 
four 
serious 
consequences: 


a) 
The 
steady 
build 
up 
of 
entropy 
always 
falls 
back 
toward 
the 
cosingularity, 
harder 
than 
when 
it 
first 
emerged 
from 
it. 
b) 
The 
next 
cycle 
of 
expansion 
starts 
out 
faster 
and 
stronger 
that 
in 
the 
previous 
cycle. 
c) 
Entropy 
will 
always 
rise, 
leading 
to 
successively 
hotter 
Big 
Bangs 
and 
successively 
longer 
“life 
cycles”. 
d) 
The 
entropy 
of 
any 
Universe 
is 
tremendously 
big. 
Moreover, 
the 
colossal 
contribution 
of 
entropy 
of 
black 
holes, 
increasing 
their 
numbers 
in 
the 
final 
stages 
of 
any 
Universe, 
and 
the 
entropy 
due 
to 
the 
complete 
collapse 
of 
the 
former 
dimensions 
produce 
a 
maximum 
quantity 
of 
entropy. 
How 
does 
it 
disappear? 

57. 
Big 
Bang 
and 
Big 
Crunch. 
Entropy 
used 
to 
form 
spacial 
dimensions 
We 
know 
the 
expansion 
out 
of 
any 
Big 
Bang 
(and 
we 
can 
add, 
the 
contraction 
out 
of 
any 
Big 
Crunch) 
at 
the 
beginning 
is 
very 
smooth 
and 
regular, 
very 
low 
in 
entropy 
(At 
least 
with 
no 
discussion, 
our 
Big-Bang 
was, 
according 
of 
calculations, 
very 
low 
in 
entropy). 
What 
happened 
with 
the 
enormous 
quantity 
of 
entropy 
that 
was 
formed? 
To 
solve 
the 
four 
apparent 
problems 
mentioned 
before, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
establish 
the 
multidimensional 
modulus. 
The 
cycles 
are 
not 
in 
the 
same 
dimension 
and 
so: 
shorter 
minimum 
limits, 
longer 
maximum 
limits; 
harder 
and 
faster 
contractions, 
stronger 
and 
faster 
expansions; 
increase 
in 
entropy 
in 
any 
Universe, 
and 
hotter 
Big 
Bangs 
in 
each 
new 
Universe 
etc., 
are 
confirmed 
one 
by 
one 
by 
the 
change 
in 
spatial 
dimensions. 
But 
what 
happened 
to 
the 
loss 
in 
entropy 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 
Universe, 
after 
the 
colossal 
increase 
in 
entropy 
during 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
former 
Universe? 
The 
answer 
is 
simple. 
All 
the 
entropy 
was 
necessary 
to 
form 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
We 
observe 
in 
the 
relation, 
E=mc2, 
where 
a 
small 
quantity 
of 
mass, 
produces 
an 
enormous 
quantity 
of 
energy. 
The 
energy 
was 
within 
the 
mass, 
forming 
its 
own 
microcosmos. 
The 
entropy 
of 
a 
collapsing 
former 
Universe 
is 
not 
lost. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
form 
the 
more 
energetic 
new 
Universe, 
or 
in 
another 
words, 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
Even 
with 
the 
considerable 
increase 
in 
entropy 
in 
the 
collapse 
of 
any 
Universe 
and 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
lot 
of 
black 
holes, 
increasing 
even 
much 
more 
the 
entropy, 
they 
are 
all 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
have 
available 
energy 
to 
form 
a 
new 
dimension, 
and 
in 
consequence 
a 
new, 
bigger, 
and 
more 
energetic 
Universe. 
If 
we 
have 
a 
Universe 
existing 
in 
a 
flat 
sheet 
of 
paper, 
by 
increasing 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
(height 
in 
this 
case), 
we 
can 
add 
billions 
of 
billions 
of 
Universes, 
one 
on 
top 
of 
the 
other. 
Black 
holes 
provide 
a 
mechanism 
to 
increase 
the 
entropy 
considerably, 
and 
it 



shows 
another 
fundamental 
key 
function 
of 
black 
holes 
for 
the 
evolution 
of 
Universes, 
besides 
the 
function 
explained 
before 
(interchange 
of 
matter-
antimatter). 
The 
gravitational 
waves 
spread 
both 
outward 
into 
the 
Universes, 
“irradiating” 
energy, 
but 
the 
ones 
that 
fall 
inward 
are 
blueshifted. 
The 
inflow 
of 
blueshifted 
gravitational 
radiation 
that 
carries 
energy 
will 
produce 
an 
extraordinary 
increase 
in 
mass 
inside 
the 
black 
hole. 
From 
outside, 
however, 
this 
additional 
increase 
of 
mass 
is 
out 
of 
the 
account 
of 
the 
original 
mass 
that 
collapsed 
to 
make 
the 
hole, 
because 
no 
information, 
about 
this 
new 
huge 
mass, 
will 
be 
at 
disposal 
of 
outside 
observation. 
But 
after 
collapse, 
in 
the 
Big 
Crush, 
all 
the 
matter, 
particles, 
even 
Black 
holes, 
will 
be 
destroyed. 
The 
matter 
and 
energy 
will 
be 
converted 
into 
entropy. 
The 
entropy 
will 
increase 
ludicrously 
and 
enormously 
after 
the 
collapse 
(cofinite 
entropy), 
but 
it 
will 
be 
used 
to 
form 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
and 
the 
new 
dimensional 
Universe 
will 
begin 
with 
a 
smooth 
origin, 
with 
cozero 
entropy.

Process

The 
1st 
Universe 
contracted, 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
way, 
until 
its 
limit 
was 
reached, 
at 
a 
constant 
“speed” 
of 
light, 
and 
it 
proceeded 
contracting, 
in 
a 
parabolic 
way, 
in 
a 
fractal 
dimension. 
The 
first 
Big 
Crush 
appeared, 
and 
its 
dimensional 
sequence 
was 
1~2. 
When 
2 
is 
reached, 
a 
new 
dimensional 
Universe 
appeared, 
the 
first 
in 
a 
sequence 
of 
String 
Universes, 
and 
after 
a 
“while” 
stopping, 
it 
changed 
its

to 
expand, 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
way, 
at 
constant

of

to

In

the

62. 
Time 
of 
our 
Universe 
The 
concept 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
infinite 
goes 
a 
long 
way 
back 
in 
the 
history 
of 
Science; 
and 
inexplicably, 
infinities 
are 
still 
used 
in 
many 
opportunities, 
even 
for 
the 
existence 
of 
“infinite” 
Universes, 
or 
that 
our 
Universe 
expands 
“forever”. 
However, 
cosmologists 
today 
are 
more 
willing 
to 
consider 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
infinite 
in 
space, 
but 
not 
in 
time. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
puts 
a 
definite 
time 
in 
the 
past: 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
approximately 
15 
billion 
years 
ago. 
New 
calculations 
prefer 
to 
use 
13.7 
billion 
years, 
but 
not 
more 
than 
14 
billion 
years. 


In 
spatial 
terms, 
there 
is 
room 
in 
an 
infinite 
Universe, 
for 
every 
possible 
thing 
to 
happen, 
including 
cofinite 
absurdities. 


Recently, 
the 
term 
Multiverse 
is 
used, 
where 
our 
Universe 
is 
but 
one 
of 
an 
enormous 
number 
of 
distinct 
Universes, 
completely 
separated 
among 
them. 
Some 
scientists 
speak 
about 
a 
Multiverse 
of 
10500 
(106 
is 
equivalent 
to 
one 
million 
different 
Universes); 
but 
others 
consider 
that 
the 
Multiverse 
itself 
is 
infinite 
in 
every 
direction, 
in 
space 
as 
well 
as 
in 
time. 
In 
any 
way, 
the 
Multiverse 
is 
related 
to 
quantum 
mechanics, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
range 
of 
possibilities 
are 
endless. 
The 
process 
to 
develop 
Universes 
would 
be 
chaotic; 
the 
quantum 
waves 
are 
incoherent; 
the 
creation 
and 
destruction 
of 
Universes 
would 
be 
colossal; 
and 
the 
uncertainty 
principle 
and 
quantum 
fluctuations 
would 
be 
disastrous. 
The 
answer 
to 
those 
questions 
is 
gravity. 
Quantum 
Theory 
predicts 
the 
Multiverse, 
where 
our 
Universe 
is 
only 
one 
of 
many 
Universes 
that 
appeared 
spontaneously 
out 
of 
nothing. 
The 
Dimensional 
Universes, 
based 
on 
gravitational 
waves 
are 
totally 
different: 
ordered, 
coherent, 
derived 
one 
from 
the 
other 
(the 
former 
and 
the 
next), 
in 
beautiful, 
physical, 
and 
mathematical 
sequences. 


The 
Universes, 
according 
to 
gravitational 
waves, 
are 
all 
coherent. 
Besides 
a 
parallel 
Universe 
(mirror 
symmetry), 
there 
exists 
a 
dimensional 
process 
in 
space-time 
that 
we 
explained 
before. 
The 
relation 
between 
Universes 
is 
the 
gravitational 
wave. 
It 
is 
an 
ordered 
and 
coherent 
wave. 
All 
the 
Universes 
are 
in 
an 
exact 
space-time, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
change 
this. 
Gravity 
is 
overwhelmingly 
important 
in 
the 
scale 
of 
stars, 
galaxies, 
and 
Universes. 
It 
is 



the 
only 
force 
that 
has 
relation 
among 
Universes. 
Any 
Universe 
begins 
with 
a 
gravity 
boson 
in 
its 
First 
event. 
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
in 
an 
even 
space-time 
Universe, 
or 
in 
the 
Big 
Crunch, 
in 
an 
odd 
space-time 
Universe, 
all 
the 
forces 
are 
together, 
having 
the 
same 
value; 
immediately 
after 
that, 
gravity 
is 
separated 
from 
the 
others. 
However, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
Big 
Crush, 
in 
expanding 
or 
contracting 
phases, 
a 
new 
gravity 
boson 
appears, 
and 
its 
appearance 
is 
not 
the 
effect, 
neither 
the 
cause, 
of 
the 
destruction 
of 
any 
Universe. 
In 
the 
macroscopic 
scale, 
the 
Universe 
is 
destroyed 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
dimension 
of 
space, 
which 
is 
done 
gradually, 
in 
a 
fractal 
way. 
The 
equivalent 
principle 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
is 
the 
gravitational 
boson. 
As 
we 
know, 
a 
graviton 
alone 
is 
enough 
to 
cause 
the 
collapse 
of 
quantum 
waves. 
For 
that 
reason, 
there 
is 
no 
measurable 
gravity 
in 
particles. 
(Real 
gravitational 
waves 
in 
Higgs 
fields 
don’t 
exist, 
except 
in 
the 
first 
Higgs 
field, 
during 
the 
Big 
Bang). 


When 
the 
new 
dimension 
finally 
appears, 
a 
new 
dimensional 
Universe 
appears. 
The 
sequences 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universes 
were 
previously 
explained.

Increase 
in 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Zero 
net 
energy 
increase 
The 
gravitational 
energy 
associated 
with 
a 
lump 
of 
matter 
is 
always 
negative, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
gravitational 
field 
contains 
negative 
entropy. 
The 
relation 
of 
gravitation, 
between 
a 
Universe 
and 
the 
next, 
is 
from 
maximum 
to 
minimum, 
in 
any 
dimensional 
change. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
Universe, 
entropy 
is 
always 
at 
its 
minimum; 
and 
at 
its 
end, 
entropy 
is 
at 
its 
maximum. 
The 
negative 
energy 
associated 
with 
the 
gravitational 
field 
in 
the 
Universe: 
negative 
mc2, 
would 
be 
equivalent 
and 
opposite 
to 
the 
rest 
mass 
energy 
of 
matter 
itself, 
positive 
mc2. 
Both 
energies 
are 
practically 
equal, 
and 
together 
they 
precisely 
cancel 
out. 
If 
we 
add 
the 
positive 
kinetic 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe, 
equivalent 
to 
(1/2)mv2 
or 
+mc2, 
and 
the 
negative 
energy 
associated 
to 
the 
cosmological 
“constant”, 
equivalent 
to 
(1/6)Λmr2c2 
or 
minus 
mc2, 
the 
Universe 
has 
approximately 
zero 
energy 
overall. 
In 
mathematical 
terms, 
we 
have. 


ϕ=mc2+(1/2)mv2-(Rc4)/G-(1/6)Λmr2c2 


We 
can 
derive 
four 
things 
from 
the 
last 
equation. 


a) 
With 
the 
accelerated 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe, 
its 
mass 
continuously 
increases. 
b) 
The 
speed 
of 
the 
kinetic 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
always 
faster 
than 
light. 
c) 
Even 
if 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
decreases 
with 
time, 
the 
mathematical 
value 
of 
its 
negative 
energy 
increases 
with 
time. 
d) 
Every 
energy, 
two 
positives 
and 
two 
negatives 
that 
are 
in 
the 
Universe, 
are 
equivalent 
to 
mc2 
each. 
The 
total 
result 
is 
cozero, 
or 
almost 
zero, 
energy.

Footing 
and 
foundation 
of 
the 
Universe 
Human 
constructions 
need 
a 
solid 
infrastructure, 
with 
resistant 
materials, 
and 
an 
adequate 
study 
of 
the 
soil. 
The 
footing 
and 
foundations 
must 
be 
of 
the 
proper 
size 
and 
in 
the 
proper 
location. 
They 
must 
be 
strong 
enough 
to 
withstand 
the 
pressure 
and 
weight 
of 
the 
buildings, 
and 
to 
avoid 
bowing 
or 
buckling. 
The 
footing 
is 
a 
concrete 
pad 
placed 
on 
the 
soil. 
The 
foundation 
wall 
is 
built 
on 
the 
footing. 
The 
footing 
holds 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
entire 
building 
and 
its 
contents, 
and 
resists 
from 
sinking 
into 
the 
soil. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
footing 
depends 
upon 
the 
load 
and 
the 
type 
of 
soil. 
Piers 
and 
columns 
rest 
on 
the 
footing. 
Structures 
must 
be 
strong 
enough 
to 
support 
loads 
without 
bending 
or 
breaking. 
In 
summary, 
the 
footing 
and 
the 
foundations 
need 
to 
be 
strong 
in 
order 
to 
have 
the 
necessary 
endurance 
to 
make 
up 
the 
basement 
upon 
which 
the 
building 
is 
built, 
supporting 
its 
weight. 
If 
the 
foundation 
of 
any 
building 
is 
not 
strong 
enough, 
it 
begins 
to 
weaken, 
and 
it 
will 
eventually 
collapse. 
All 
human 
constructions 
require 
foundation 
and 
footing, 
with 
strength 
proportional 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
mass 
that 
needs 
to 
support; 
but 
the 
Universe 
was 
built 
in 
a 
completely 
different 
way, 
a 
very 
efficient 
one. 
The 
footing 
and 
foundation 
of 
any 
Universe 
is 
simply 
a 
very 
tiny 
vacuum, 
in 
the 
minimum 
limit, 
with 
Planck 
length; 
with 
the 
condition 
that 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
shrink 
it. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
footing 
and 
foundations 
of 
any 
Universe 
are 
smaller 
when 
the 
Universe 
is 
larger. 
(According 
to 
the 
law: 
the 
minimum 
of 
any 
Universe 
is 
inverse 
to 
its 
maximum). 
Instead 
of 
increasing 
the 
mass 
and 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
“foundation”, 
the 
Universe 
is 
supported 
by 
a 
vacuum 
with 
wormhole 
limits, 
with 
Planck 
length 
size 
(In 
our 
Universe, 
1.615979906 
x 
10-33 
cm). 
The 
wormhole 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter 
existed 
in 
our 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
when 
the 
Universe 
reached 
its 
inflection 
point; 
and 
stopped, 
with 
no 
movement, 
forming 
a 
perfect 
cube, 
but 
since 
it 
has 
not 
defined 
lines, 
we 
prefer 
to 
call 
it 
a 
“cuboide”. 
In 
our 
4th 
Universe 
(space-time), 
there 
are 
8 
“cuboides”, 
4 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
4 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter, 
(Forming 
a 
wormhole, 
with 
length 
of 
2λp; 
λp 
on 
each 
Universe. 
In 
the 
3rd 
Universe 
(space-time) 
there 
were 
“4 
squaroides”, 
with 
size 
1.377074081 
x 
10-22 
cm 
each). 
In 
the 
4th 
Universe, 
with 
the 
up-down 
direction, 
it 
has 
4x2=8 
“cuboides”. 



65. 
Pre 
Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
Wormholes 
This 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
needs 
to 
be 
quiet, 
prefect, 
intact; 
impossible 
to 
break 
or 
deform; 
impossible 
to 
shrink 
or 
stretch; 
a 
vacuum, 
impossible 
to 
change. 
It's 
the 
perfect 
foundation 
and 
footing. 
A 
vacuum 
(almost 
nothing) 
supporting 
the 
tremendous 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
which 
is 
constantly 
increasing. 
The 
principle 
is 
simple: 
impossible 
to 
change 
or 
deform, 
it 
doesn’t 
need 
to 
have 
a 
big 
mass, 
only 
an 
unchangeable 
length. 
sub-
Planck 
distances 
don’t 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe, 
because 
if 
the 
size 
of 
Planck 
length 
shrinks, 
it 
would 
be 
equivalent 
to 
weakening 
its 
structure 
and 
the 
Universe 
would 
eventually 
collapse. 


When 
movement 
began 
(speed) 
in 
the 
first 
chronos; 
mass, 
the 
constants 
of 
nature, 
and 
the 
different 
energies, 
emerged. 
Mass 
formed 
irregularities 
in 
the 
fabric 
of 
space-time; 
kinetic 
energy 
deformed 
the 
perfect 
sphere, 
wider 
in 
the 
Equator, 
and 
shorter 
in 
North 
Pole-South 
Pole 
axis. 
The 
Cosmological 
variable 
stretched 
space, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
Universe 
began 
to 
develop, 
but 
since 
that 
moment 
it 
is 
not 
useful 
to 
sustain 
the 
Universe. 
But 
wormholes 
with 
static 
shapes 
continued 
to 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe. 
The 
Big 
Bang 
(including 
the 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario), 
in 
the 
instant 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
third 
dimension 
of 
space, 
stopped 
for 
a 
“while”. 
It 
did 
not 
occur 
like 
a 
single 
point 
in 
space 
that 
expanded 
with 
an 
“explosion”. 
It 
was 
not 
an 
expansion 
of 
matter 
into 
space; 
it's 
the 
expansion 
of 
space 
itself. 
The 
Universe 
is 
expanding. 
It 
is 
better 
thought 
as 
the 
simultaneous 
appearance 
of 
space 
everywhere 
in 
the 
Universe, 
and 
it 
continues 
to 
expand. 
The 
static 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
(vacuum 
with 
limits) 
continues 
existing 
at 
any 
place, 
waiting 
for 
more 
powerful 
accelerators, 
strong 
enough 
to 
reach 
them. 
When 
Planck 
length 
is 
reached, 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
and 
the 
wormholes 
– 
the 
pathways 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
and 
the 
foundation 
of 
both 
Universes, 
the 
Pre-Big-Bang 
scenario, 
will 
be 
reached 
too. 



66. 
Hyperbolic 
functions 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Inflection 
point 
Describing 
only 
our 
four-dimensional 
(space-time) 
Universe 
and 
the 
three-
dimensional 
(space-time) 
Universe 
we 
apparently 
see, 
although 
the 
relation 
is 
similar 
in 
other 
dimensional 
Universes, 
they 
always 
develop 
as 
a 
hyperbolic 
function: 
a 
hyperbola 
in 
the 
3rd 
Universe 
and 
a 
hyperboloid 
of 
two 
sheets 
in 
the 
4th 
Universe, 
both 
in 
space-time. 
Remember, 
before 
any 
Universe 
begins 
to 
move, 
there 
is 
an 
inflection 
point 
where 
the 
Universe 
stops, 
before 
a 
new 
cycle 
begins. 
The 
essence 
of 
any 
Universe 
is 
movement, 
but 
in 
the 
inflection 
point, 
there 
is 
no 
movement, 
only 
a 
tendency 
to 
it. 
The 
movement 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
develop 
any 
Universe, 
but 
it 
tends 
to 
deform 
it, 
or 
in 
better 
words, 
tends 
to 
form 
some 
“irregularities”, 
that 
instead 
of 
being 
defects, 
are 
essential 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
future 
stars, 
galaxies, 
and 
constellations. 
Remember, 
nature 
is 
wise 
and 
completely 
efficient. 
All 
is 
perfectly 
calculated. 
Any 
inefficient 
process 
is 
simply 
the 
product 
of 
human 
imagination. 


But 
the 
“foundation” 
of 
the 
Universe 
needs 
to 
be 
static 
with 
a 
perfect 
shape. 
Depending 
of 
the 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions, 
the 
wormhole 
is 
formed 
by 
a 
“virtual” 
structure; 
vacuum 
with 
limits, 
with 
straight 
lines 
equal 
in 
each 
dimension, 
in 
order 
to 
form 
a 
compact 
unity. 
A 
sphere 
with 
no 
movement 
is 
a 
“perfect” 
structure, 
but 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
fill 
a 
complex 
space 
with 
spheres 
(except 
in 
the 
1st 
Universe, 
where 
a 
“sphere” 
is 
a 
straight 
line). 
Besides 
that, 
when 
the 
sphere 
begins 
to 
move, 
it 
starts 
to 
deform. 
The 
foundation 
needs 
to 
be 
exactly 
the 
same 
in 
every 
place. 
A 
small 
difference 
means 
a 
fracture, 
and 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
collapse. 
Planck 
length, 
and 
its 
corresponding 
shape 
and 
size, 
according 
to 
the 
dimensional 
Universe 
we 
are 
talking 
about, 
is 
impossible 
to 
shrink, 
but 
it 
also 
needs 
to 
be 
impossible 
to 
stretch, 
not 
even 
by 
an 
infinitesimal 
increase. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
stage. 
The 
hyperbolic 
functions 
begin 
with 
the 
first 
movement. 
We 
have 
speed 
and 
time, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
mass. 
It's 
the 
first 
“point” 
(dot) 
in 
the 
hyperbolic 
figure. 
If 
we 
take 
the 
hyperbola 
for 
example, 
the 
corresponding 
hyperbolic 
function 
at 
our 
apparent 
Universe 
(the 
Universe 
we 
can 
see), 
we 
find: 



There 
is 
no 
regular 
form 
(this 
is 
not 
the 
“foundation” 
support 
of 
the 
Universe). 
That 
was 
the 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
When 
the 
hyperbolic 
function 
begins, 
the 
Universe 
begins 
to 
develop 
and 
to 
form 
elements 
and 
eventually, 
life. 
In 
a 
hyperbola, 
we 
have 
two 
square 
terms, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
+ 
and 
–. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
obtained 
4 
different 
directions: 


+x+y 
:first 
quadrant 


x+y 
:second 
quadrant 


-x-y 
:third 
quadrant 


+x-y 
:fourth 
quadrant 
And 
this 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
4 
“squaroides”, 
the 
“foundation” 
or 
support 
of 
the 
3rd 
space-time 
Universe. 
In 
our 
Universe 
(3+1), 
the 
8 
”cuboides”, 
according 
to 
the 
directions, 
are: 


x+y+z 


x+y-z 


-x+y+z 


-x+y-z 


-x-y+z 


-x-y-z 


+x-y+z 


+x-y-z 
They 
are 
obtained 
by 
adding 
+z 
and 
–z 
(the 
2 
directions 
of 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension) 
to 
each 
direction 
of 
the 
former 
Universe. 
This 
is 
equivalent 
to 
4x2=8. 



In 
the 
next 
section 
we 
will 
explain, 
with 
this 
figure, 
why 
the 
initial 
curvature 
of 
the 
Universe 
goes 
away. 
The 
inflation 
can’t 
explain 
it, 
and 
its 
explanations 
are 
only 
apparent 
from 
an 
incomplete 
perspective. 



67. 
Causes 
of 
the 
inflation 
of 
our 
Universe 
The 
inflation 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
absolutely 
true, 
but 
the 
exact 
theory 
needs 
to 
be 
adjusted. 
However 
inflation 
is 
produced 
by: 


a) 
The 
permanent 
faster-than-light 
expansion 
of 
Universe. 
b) 
The 
interchange 
phases 
during 
the 
appearance 
of 
three 
Higgs 
Bosons 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
which 
increased 
the 
normal 
inflation 
to 
a 
different 
moment 
of 
exponential 
inflation. 
The 
objective 
of 
inflation 
is 
to 
create 
matter 
and 
antimatter, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
residual 
heat 
produced 
by 
inflation. 
In 
the 
microcosmos, 
there 
was 
a 
lot 
of 
matter 
creation, 
because 
the 
“bricks” 
of 
the 
Universe 
(particles) 
were 
formed. 
The 
extra-energy 
produced 
by 
the 
normal 
inflation 
was 
increased 
by 
the 
change 
of 
phases, 
producing 
a 
much 
faster 
inflation. 
But 
until 
now, 
and 
until 
the 
last 
event, 
mass 
will 
continuously 
be 
formed 
in 
the 
Universe, 
in 
a 
minor 
scale, 
in 
accordance 
to 
our 
arithmetical 
time. 


The 
inflation 
is 
permanent, 
the 
hyperbolic 
function 
will 
continue 
until 
the 
maximum 
space 
limit 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
reached: 
2.923096699 
x 
1032 
cm 
(9.750401056 
x 
1021 
s). 
The 
reason 
of 
inflation 
is 
to 
make 
energy, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
mass; 
this 
is 
evident, 
but 
the 
other 
effects 
of 
inflation: 
the 
dilution 
of 
monopoles 
and 
the 
explanation 
of 
why 
the 
Universe 
is 
almost 
flat 
right 
now 
is 
not 
convincing. 
We 
talked 
before 
about 
monopoles; 
and 
now, 
we 
will 
refer 
to 
the 
curvature 
of 
our 
Universe. 
Like 
we 
said 
before, 
the 
Universe 
will 
never 
be 
flat. 
The 
causes: 
it 
began 
with 
a 
non-zero 
Planck 
size; 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
produces 
gravity, 
and 
this 
force 
tends 
to 
bend 
the 
Universe 
(“Space 
tells 
matter 
how 
to 
move; 
matter 
tells 
space 
how 
to 
bend”). 
But 
we 
know 
that 
in 
the 
beginning, 
the 
Universe 
had 
a 
more 
pronounced 
curvature. 
The 
example 
that 
inflation 
reduced 
the 
curvature 
is 
not 
necessarily 
true. 
When 
the 
Universe 
increases 
in 
size, 
and 
an 
observer 
stays 
without 
any 
change, 
is 
logical 
that 
the 
observed 
object 
is 
flatter, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
observer, 
even 
if 
it 
has 
the 
same 
curvature. 
For 
example: 
an 
astronaut 
would 
see 
earth 
like 
a 
globe 
from 
outer 
space 
but, 
as 
the 
astronaut 
approaches 
Earth, 
it 
would 
seem 
flatter, 
it 
would 
seem 
almost 
flat 
as 
he 
lands, 
and 
standing 
on 
the 
ground, 
he 
would 
see 
straight 
lines 
on 
the 
horizon. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
subject 
of 
relation 
of 
apparent 
size. 
The 
most 
flatness, 
the 
straight 
lines, 



would 
be 
seen 
when 
the 
tangent 
(point 
of 
contact) 
is 
reached. 
However, 
the 
curvature 
of 
the 
Earth 
continues 
to 
be 
the 
same. 



68. 
Curvature 
and 
inflation 
of 
our 
Universe 
Increasing 
the 
size 
of 
Universe 
by 
inflation 
does 
not 
necessarily 
changes 
its 
curvature; 
and 
any 
scientific 
position 
is 
always 
independent 
from 
the 
criterion 
of 
observers. 
The 
curvature 
of 
our 
Universe 
decreases 
with 
time. 
It 
is 
a 
natural 
process 
of 
our 
Universe, 
due 
to 
the 
hyperbolic 
character 
of 
its 
space. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
space 
is 
curve 
and 
it 
reduces 
its 
curvature 
while 
the 
Universe 
is 
expanding. 
It 
will 
never 
be 
completely 
flat, 
but 
it 
will 
always 
be 
approaching 
the 
diagonals 
in 
an 
asymptotical 
way. 
The 
mathematical 
explanation 
is 
easy. 
Space 
in 
our 
Universe 
will 
never 
be 
flat, 
because 
according 
to 
the 
reality 
and 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
Superstring 
theory, 
the 
Big 
Bang 
had 
non 
zero 
space. 
If 
Planck 
length 
(1.615979906x10-33 
cm 
or 
-75.50536654 
(In)) 
is 
not 
zero, 
space 
can't 
be 
zero. 
The 
hyperbola 
formula 
confirms 
it. 
(In 
hyperbolic 
formulas 
with 
more 
spatial 
dimensions, 
the 
procedure 
is 
similar, 
but 
mathematically 
more 
complicated). 




Notes: 


* 
We 
put 
y 
as 
zero 
from 
a 
mathematical 
sense. 
In 
physical 
terms, 
while 
x 
exists, 
y 
can 
never 
be 
zero, 
since 
x 
in 
our 
Universe, 
has 
always 
y 
(and 
z) 
size, 
even 
infinitesimally. 
** 
The 
relation 
is 
easy 
to 
see. 
The 
difference 
between 
x2 
and 
y2 
is 
always 
λp2. 
The 
influence 
of 
this 
difference 
is 
strong 
at 
the 
beginning, 
with 
small 
measures, 
and 
it 
is 
almost 
negligible 
in 
bigger 
measures. 
The 
curvature 
at 
the 
beginning 
is 
very 
pronounced; 
and 
decreases 
considerably 
with 
time. 
A 
flat 
Universe 
would 
be 
when 
y 
and 
x 
have 
identical 
size. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
the 
curvature 
is 
at 
its 
maximum. 
Right 
now, 
the 
Universe 
is 
almost 
flat, 
but 
it 
will 
never 
be 
completely 
flat. 
This 
mathematical 
relation 
doesn’t 
depend 
on 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
observers, 
neither 
on 
its 
subjective 
criterion. 
It 
is 
basically 
a 
condition 
of 
the 
Universe. 



69. 
Mass 
and 
space. 
Uncertainty 
principle 
in 
mass 
of 
particles 
The 
relation 
of 
mass 
is 
always 
a 
relation 
of 
space. 
Two 
different 
kinds 
of 
mass 
are 
essential 
in 
the 
Universe: 
the 
masses 
of 
particles, 
depending 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
principle 
(quantum 
waves) 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
(gravitational 
waves). 
The 
formula 
for 
particles 
is 
exact, 
and 
it 
is 
related 
to 
the 
constants 
ℏ 
and 
c. 


ℏ=mcλ, 
so 
ℏ/c= 
mλ 
And 
this 
is 
accepted 
by 
all 
the 
scientific 
community, 
although 
inexplicably, 
it 
is 
then 
discarded, 
with 
no 
intention, 
by 
accepting 
the 
wrong 
concept 
that 
before 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
all 
the 
particles 
lacked 
mass. 
The 
other 
formula, 
for 
cosmic 
mass, 
is 
exact 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
Universe, 
when 
the 
Universe 
didn't 
have 
irregularities. 
The 
sphere 
was 
completely 
exact 
in 
the 
first 
chronos 
and 
practically 
exact 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
with 
exponential 
inflation 
and 
a 
sea 
of 
particles 
with 
no 
measurable 
gravity. 
In 
the 
macrocosmos 
era, 
the 
formula 
is 
approximately 
exact, 
and 
we 
can 
show 
that 
this 
relation 
is 
basically 
true 
in 
our 
Universe. 


GM~Rc2 
Where 
G 
is 
the 
gravitational 
constant, 
M 
is 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
R 
is 
its 
radius. 
The 
formula 
is 
exact, 
but 
the 
result 
is 
only 
approximately 
exact, 
due 
to 
the 
irregularities 
of 
the 
Universe; 
which 
are 
essential 
to 
form 
the 
structures 
to 
support 
life. 
Scientists 
don’t 
completely 
accept 
this 
equation, 
and 
in 
the 
past, 
they 
even 
tried 
to 
avoid 
its 
use; 
presenting 
a 
class 
of 
theories, 
termed 
“scalecovariant”, 
where 
in 
some 
of 
these 
theories, 
G 
varies 
with 
time. 
Experimental 
results 
found 
that 
some 
seconds 
after 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
G 
was 
essentially 
what 
it 
is 
now. 
More 
easily, 
the 
constant 
value 
of 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c 
are 
fixed 
at 
the 
first 
chronos, 
when 
all 
the 
4 
forces 
were 
united, 
equating 
both 
formulas. 
G 
is 
totally 
constant 
from 
the 
first 
chronos 
to 
the 
last 
event, 
just 
like 
c 
and 
ℏ. 
In 
that 
position 
G/c2 
=k'=R/M 
or 
c2/G=k''=M/R. 
And 
like 
we 
explained 
before, 
we 
can 
obtain 
λp, 
Mp, 
R1u 
and, 
M1u. 
Since 
R 
is 
variable, 
M 
needs 
to 
change 
in 
a 
direct 
relation. 
The 
mass 
of 
Universe 
increases 
with 
time, 
as 
R 
is 
increasing 
in 
size. 
Also, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 



age 
of 
the 
Universe 
divided 
by 
its 
mass 
is 
a 
constant. 



70. 
Cosmological 
"constant" 
and 
density 
of 
vacuum 
The 
hyperbola, 
as 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
3rd 
space-time 
Universe; 
and 
the 
hyperboloid 
of 
2 
sheets, 
as 
the 
shape 
of 
the 
4th 
Space-time 
Universe, 
are 
correct 
representations 
of 
them, 
considering 
time 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe. 
In 
an 
instant 
of 
time 
(dt), 
we 
have 
approximately 
exact 
circles 
and 
spheres, 
in 
each 
Universe. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
obtain 
the 
density 
of 
vacuum 
in 
a 
simplified 
form 
in 
any 
instant 
of 
time. 


ρvac 
≅ 
(Λc2)/(8πG) 
Considering 
that 
Λ 
is 
constant, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
interpret 
it 
as 
a 
fixed 
mass 
density. 
Λ 
is 
bounded 
empirically 
by 
Λ 
< 
3 
x 
10-56 
cm-2. 
So, 
the 
critical 
density 
is 
obtained 


ρc< 
1.61 
x 
10-29 
g/cm3 
However, 
the 
Universe 
changes 
its 
density, 
from 
a 
larger 
value 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
to 
a 
minimum 
value 
at 
the 
last 
event. 
The 
actual 
density 
of 
the 
Universe, 
approximately 
similar 
to 
the 
critical 
density, 
is 
only 
a 
coincidence. 
But 
since 
Λ 
is 
variable, 
ρvac 
varies 
with 
time. 
We 
can 
obtain 
an 
approximate 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
any 
instant 
of 
time, 
considering 
the 
approximate 
mass 
of 
Universe 
according 
to 
the 
relation 
Rc2/G=M; 
and 
volume 
approximately 
equal 
to 
(4/3)πr3. 
Example 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang: 


Mass 
= 
Rc2/G 
= 
λpc2/G 
= 
2.176814012 
x 
10-5 
g 
Volume 
≅ 
(4/3)πλp3= 
1.767650814 
x 
10-98 
cm3 
ρvac 
≅ 
1.231472865 
x 
1093 
g/cm3 


If 
we 
use 
the 
formula 


ρvac 
≅ 
(Λc2)/(8πG) 
We 
can 
obtain 
the 
same 
result, 
using 
the 
correct 
value 
of 
Λ 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
approximately 
10120 
times 
bigger 
than 
the 
empirical 
result 
of 
Λ 
obtained 
in 
the 
present 
time. 


ρvac 
≅ 
(Λc2)/(8πG) 



Λ(Planck 
time)

x 
1066

(approximately 
7.66 
x

times 
bigger) 
ρvac=(2.297626006

x 
6.672 
x10-8) 
ρvac=1.231472865 
x1093 
g/cm3 


The 
minimum 
density 
will 
be 
in 
the 
last 
event. 
The 
Cosmological 
variable 
will 
be 
in 
that 
moment, 
7.02206565 
x 
10-65 
cm-2, 
and 
the 
approximate 
density 
of 
vacuum 
would 
be: 


ρvac 
≅ 
3.76366009 
x 
10-38 
g/cm3 


(approximately 
the 
density 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
of 
the 
electron 
neutrino) 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
compare 
the 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
and 
its 
corresponding 
density 
with 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
of 
particles; 
a 
beautiful 
relation, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
virtual 
relation 
of 
abstract 
space; 
not 
necessarily 
existing 
in 
physical 
terms. 
We 
will 
show 
this 
later. 



71. 
Values 
of 
π 
minus 
and 
π 
plus 
Our 
Universe 
has 
a 
minimum 
limit, 
or 
Planck 
length, 
equivalent 
to 
1.615979906 
x 
10-33 
cm 
or 
-75.50536654 
in 
natural 
logarithm 
units. 
Since 
the 
exponential 
factor 
is 
24π, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
value 
that 
we 
can 
call 
π 
plus, 
obtained 
by 
including 
the 
spatial 
correction 
factor, 
and 
this 
is 
equivalent 
to 
-3.146056939. 
With 
the 
maximum 
limit, 
equivalent 
to 
2.923096699 
x 
1032 
cm 
or 
74.75536654, 
we 
can 
obtain 
πminus 
or 
3.114806939. 
Adapting 
this 
last 
value 
to 
the 
microcosmos, 
we 
obtain 
an 
inverse 
value, 
-3.114806939. 
All 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
have 
their 
fields 
with 
λ, 
between 
λp 
and 
0.687289278 
cm 
obtaining 
their 
matter 
by 
means 
of 
Higgs 
fields, 
that 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 


modify,inordertoincludeallthemassesoftheparticles.
λ 
of 
particles 
that 
are 
still 
forming 
cannot 
be 
larger 
than 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
the 
microcosmos, 
approximately 
1 
cm, 
or 
exactly 
0.687289278 
cm. 
Their 
Higgs 
fields 
are 
the 
repetition 
of 
the 
last 
Higgs 
field 
of 
the 
microcosmos. 
In 
other 
words, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
have 
longer 
Higgs 
fields 
in 
the 
macrocosmos. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
position 
in 
the 
next 
section. 


We 
can 
put 
positive 
κ, 
with 
negative 
π 
(plus 
or 
minus), 
or 
put 
negative 
κ 
with 
positive 
π 
(plus 
or 
minus). 
The 
reason 
is 
to 
have 
the 
product 
of 
κ 
π 
always 
negative. 



72. 
Known 
and 
unknown 
scales; 
their 
division 
in 
4π 
cycles 
The 
shadowed 
area 
represents 
the 
microcosmos, 
where 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
were 
forming. 
In 
that 
position, 
we 
must 
only 
use 
π 
plus. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
special 
relation 
between 
Higgs 
fields 
and 
the 
cosmic 
field, 
at 
least 
in 
an 
abstract 
sense 
(or 
inflation 
effects), 
move 
the 
half 
of 
the 
microcosmos, 
to 
the 
area 
of 
influence 
of 
π 
minus. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
have 
two 
chains 
of 
families 
of 
particles, 
using 
π 
minus 
in 
one 
and 
π 
plus 
in 
the 
other. 
If 
we 
divide 
the 
microcosmos 
into 
two 
areas, 
we 
would 
have 
them 
with 
12π 
each. 
12-12. 
Like 
we 
explained 


before,wehave3cyclesof4πeach.So:
With 
longer 
waves, 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
are 
lighter, 
and 
with 
shorter 
waves, 
the 
masses 
are 
heavier. 
The 
leptons, 
being 
only 
6 
in 
each 
chain 
(3 
neutrinos 
and 
3 
electrons), 
use 
more 
than 
2/3 
of 
the 
space 
available 
to 
obtain 



their 
masses, 
exactly 
2/3 
in 
exclusive 
character. 
Maintaining 
the 
symmetry, 
we 
can 
divide 
each 
cycle 
by 
1, 
2, 
and 
4, 
in 
that 
order. 
Divisions 
by 
1 
and 
2 
represent 
exact 
2π 
or 
n2π. 
However, 
dividing 
by 
4 
represents 
π 
only, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
cycle 
is 
not 
completed, 
and 
in 
the 
remaining 
area, 
there 
exist 
a 
large 
number 
of 
masses, 
as 
resonances. 



73. 
Hook 
relation 
in 
k-12π 
The 
second 
chain 
is 
not 
yet 
accepted, 
because 
most 
of 
the 
scientific 
community 
is 
still 
looking 
for 
the 
superpartners, 
without 
success. 
However, 
we 
see 
a 
break 
in 
both 
chains, 
and 
in 
that 
point, 
all 
the 
known 
particles 
use 
π 
minus 
except 
for 
the 
heaviest 
particles 
and 
forces 
now 
known: 
W+, 
W-,Z0, 
top 
±2/3, 
bottom±1/3, 
and 
the 
(weak 
Higgs 
boson)0, 
where 
we 
will 
use 
π 
plus. 
Because 
of 
that 
breakdown, 
these 
particles 
and 
forces 
are 
even 
heavier. 
Using 
π 
minus, 
the 
mass 
of 
top 
would 
be 
of 
around 
124, 
instead 
of 
approximately 
177, 
and 
W 
and 
Z 
would 
be 
of 
around 
60. 
Most 
of 
the 
particles 
are 
in 
the 
area 
between 
k-8π 
and 
k-12π. 
Every 
quark 
is 
inside 
that 
area 
too.

We

detail 
the 
study 
about 
this 
second 
scale 
later. 
In 
the 
next 
section, 
we 
will 
study 
the

Among 
-9π,

we 
have 
most 
of 
the

their

(hadrons, 
mesons, 
etc.) 
according 
to 
the 
three

u, 
d; 
c, 
s; 
t,

The 
value 
of 
π 
minus 
in 
κ0π, 
needs 
to 
be 
adjusted, 
since 
e0=1, 
it's 
only 
a 
approximate 
value. 
We

This 
is 
the 
Maximum 
mass 
that 
can 
have 
a 
field 
in 
this 
known 
chain 
of 
3 
families; 
where 
our 
new 
accelerators 
can 
probe. 
It 
is 
an 
enormous 
value, 
compared 
to 
the 
neutrino; 
but 
it 
is 
a 
small 
value, 
compared 
to 
the 
second 
chain, 
especially 
to 
Planck 
mass, 
the 
maximum 
value. 
In 
logarithmic 
scale, 
it 
is 
approximately 
half, 
but 
in 
arithmetical 
scale, 
it's 
only 
its 
squared 
root. 
It’s 
λ 
is 
exactly 
√(λp) 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
cannot 
be 
heavier 
than 
482.39 
GeV, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
entire 
field.

Mass 
of 
the 
neutronio 
In 
the 
first 
scale, 
we 
use 
π 
minus 
(except 
in 
k-12π 
where 
we 
use 
π 
plus). 
Using 
π 
minus, 
λ 
of 
k-12π 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
inverse 
of 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
Universe. 
√(1/(2.923096699 
x

x

In 
order 
for 
it 
to 
have 
symmetry, 
it 
could 
be 
the 
first 
term 
of 
the 
second 
chain. 
We 
will 
develop 
the 
second 
chain 
later, 
but 
since 
the 
power 
of 
current 
accelerators 
is 
close 
to 
κ-12π 
minus, 
we 
will 
detail 
its 
value 
in 
this 
section.

GeV 



This 
particle 
will 
appear 
in 
the 
LHC, 
before 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
does, 
which 
is 
heavier. 
It 
is 
very 
important 
not 
to 
confuse 
them. 


CERN 
has 
a 
big 
responsibility 
in 
trying 
to 
find 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
and 
a 
heavy 
neutral 
particle 
beyond 
the 
Standard 
Model. 
Even 
if 
this 
neutral 
particle 
(that 
we 
have 
called 
neutronio) 
is 
a 
fermion 
(spin 
1⁄2), 
the 
collision 
distance 
of 
the 
neutronio-antineutronio 
pair 
is 
only 
5.848956755 
x 
10-17cm, 
and 
these 
particles 
are 
141.5 
heavier 
than 
the 
proton, 
and 
so, 
this 
pair 
acts 
almost 
like 
if 
they 
were 
a 
single 
unit 
(practically 
together). 
Because 
each 
particle 
has 
a 
spin 
of 
1⁄2, 
with 
an 
opposite 
helicity; 
the 
pair 
is 
a 
single 
doublet 
with 
0 
spin 
(+1⁄2, 
-1⁄2); 
just 
like 
the 
Higgs 
scalar 
boson, 
but 
with 
a 
small 
difference. 


The 
neutronio-antineutronio 
pair 
has 
a 
modified 
Higgs 
field, 
and 
it 
decays 



especially 
in 
two 
photons 
(cc). 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
probably 
a 
quartet 
(or 
two 
doublets) 
and 
decays 
in 
tt, 
bb, 
ww, 
and 
gg 
(gluon-gluon); 
photon 
and 
ZZ 
decays 
are 
minimal. 


Even 
if 
the 
neutronio-antineutronio 
pair 
is 
unstable, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
separate 
them 
before 
they 
collide. 
This 
way, 
we 
could 
obtain 
a 
completely 
stable 
neutronio. 
This 
would 
be 
the 
fundamental 
component 
of 
dark 
matter. 
The 
process 
to 
do 
this 
will 
be 
explained 
further 
ahead.

Mathematical 
relation 
between 
Higgs 
and 
cosmic 
scales 
The 
relation 
between 
the 
Higgs 
scale 
and 
the 
cosmic 
scale 
is 
not 
only 
mathematical, 
but 
also 
physical, 
as 
we 
will 
see 
in 
the 
following 
tables. 
Both 
scales 
are 
different, 
and 
act 
with 
different 
principles 
(essentially, 
the 
Higgs 
scale 
has 
relation 
with 
quantum 
waves 
and 
quantum 
mechanics; 
and 
the 
cosmic 
scale 
has 
relation 
with 
gravitational 
waves 
and 
quantum 
cosmological). 
There 
exists 
an 
internal 
relation 
that 
corresponds 
to 
the 
average 
density 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
and 
its 
equivalent 
cosmic 
field 
densities. 
The 
Higgs 
(modified) 
field 
acts 
from 
Planck 
length 
(1.615979906 
x 
10-33) 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
(almost 
one 
cm.). 
The 
cosmic 
scale 
acts 
from 
Planck 
length 
(almost 
zero 
cm.) 
until 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe, 
this 
is, 
the 
maximum 
length,

x 
1032 
cm 
or 
ln 
74.75536654; 
in 
summary 
κ 
+24π. 
In 
mathematical 
terms, 
both 
scales 
act 
from 
κ-24π, 
and 
continue 
one 
“space” 
in 
Higgs 
scale, 
and 
two 
“spaces” 
in 
Cosmic 
scale, 
in 
a 
logarithmical

in

to

Physical 
relation 
between 
Higgs 
and 
cosmic 
scales 
A 
physical 
relation 
appears 
in 
both 
scales, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
average 
density. 
The 
principle 
is: 
In 
the 
same 
related 
step 
between 
the 
Higgs 
scale 
and 
the 
cosmic 
scale, 
the 
average 
density 
of 
both 
is 
equivalent. 
Or 
in 
other 
words: 
the 
average 
density 
of 
a 
Higgs 
field 
in 
a 
determined 
step 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
average 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
its 
corresponding 
step. 
The 
mathematical 
relations 
of 
average 
density 
are: 


Cosmic: 
(Λc2)/(8πG)=(3c2)/(4πGR2) 


Higgs: 
(ℏ.3)/(cλ.4πλ3 
)=(3ℏ)/(4πcλ4 
) 


If 
we 
equate 
both 
terms 
we 
obtain 
another 
simpler 
relation: 


(3c2)/(4πGR2 
)=(3ℏ)/(4πcλ4) 


λ4/R2 
=(Gℏ)/c3 
where 
(Gℏ)/c3 
=λp2; 
and 
so 


λ4=R2.λp2 


λ2=R.λp 


In 
the 
second 
scale, 
with 
π 
plus 
(that 
the 
Standard 
Model 
refuses), 
the 
formula 
is 
exact, 
since 
its 
relation 
with 
Planck 
length 
is 
direct. 
In 
the 
first 
scale, 
with 
π 
minus, 
that 
represents 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
known 
today, 
we 
need 
to 
use 
a 
correction 
factor, 
since 
Plank 
length 
is 
not 
directly 
related. 
Its 
corresponding 
relation 
is 
with 
the 
Maximum. 
The 
relation 
is 
e0.75, 
or 
2.117000017, 
whose 
origin 
we 
explained 
before. 
The 
results 
are 
only 
approximately 
exact, 
even 
if 
the 
formulas 
are 
mathematically 
correct, 
due 
to 
small 
fluctuations 
in 
quantum 
mechanics 
and 
small 
irregularities 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Universe 
that 
act 
like 
small 
fluctuations 
in 
quantum 
cosmological.

Minimum 
and 
maximum 
mass 
for 
particles 
of 
matter 
and 
Universe 
There 
are 
different 
ways 
to 
obtain 
the 
same 
results: 
using 
the 
normal 
formulas; 
using 
the 
reduced 
formula 
λ2=Rαλp; 
or 
λ2=Rλp 
according 
to 
the 
scale; 
or 
using 
a 
constant 
factor, 
multiplied 
by 
different 
spaces, 
by 
the 
Higgs 
field 
(3ℏ)/(4πcλ4)=8.397860785x10-39/λ4 
or 
by 
the 
Cosmic 
field: 
(3c2)/(4πGR2)=3.215857224x1027/R2. 


Depending 
on 
the 
formula 
used, 
there 
are 
additional 
approximations, 
depending 
on 
the 
approximate 
values 
that 
we 
used 
in 
arithmetical 
operations. 


In 
the 
last 
term 
of 
this 
first 
scale, 
the 
formula 
needs 
to 
be 
moved, 
because 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
increase 
the 
Maximum, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
factor 
α=2.117000017 
is 
passed 
to 
the 
other 
size, 
dividing 
it, 
and 
so: 


λ2=Rαλp 
λ2/α=Rλp 
or 
(λ/√α)2=Rλp. 


In 
that 
way, 
instead 
of 
having 
the 
Maximum 
Higgs 
field=1cm 
and 
Maximum 
Cosmic 
field 
=6.188195761 
x 
1032 
cm, 
we 
have: 
Maximum 
length 
in 
Higgs 
field 
(level 
κ 
α) 


1/√2.117000017=0.687289278 
cm 


And 
Maximum 
length 
in 
Cosmic 
field 
= 
2.923096699 
x 
1032 
cm. 


According 
to 
Physics, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Universe, 
we 
have 
the 
minimum 
mass 
in 
a 
field 
of 
particles 
of 
matter, 
and 
the 
maximum 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
with 
average 
density 
equivalent 
in 
both. 
The 
mass 
of 
neutrino1 
is 
obtained 
by 
dividing 
the 
corresponding 
Higgs 
field 
by 
√(2π)=2.506628275; 
and 
the 
result 
is 
1.125609369 
x 
10-14 
GeV. 
This 
is 
the 
minimum 
mass 
of 
particles 
of 
matter. 
Lighter 
particles 
are 
impossible 
to 
be 
sustained 
in 
our 
Universe. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
at 
its 
maximum 
at 
its 
end, 
approximately 
3.94x1060 
g. 
A 
heavier 
Universe 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
sustain, 
considering 



our 
four-dimensional 
Universe 
(3 
spatial 
dimensions 
+

Similar 
procedure 
to 
get 
masses 
in 
both 
scales 
The 
fundamental 
mass 
of 
particles 
is 
obtained 
according 
to 
the 
Higgs 
fields. 
Before, 
we 
obtained 
the 
corresponding 
masses 
of 
known 
particles. 
We 
will 
detail 
later 
the 
supposed 
masses 
of 
particles 
of 
matter 
from 
the 
heavier 
scale 
in 
a 
similar 
way. 
Nature 
is 
completely 
efficient, 
and 
doesn’t 
change 
procedure. 
What 
needs 
to 
change 
is 
the 
procedure 
according 
to 
the 
human 
mind. 
It 
is 
always 
easier 
to 
simplify 
the 
processes, 
and 
the 
best 
way 
to 
do 
it, 
is 
unifying 
them. 
The 
Higgs 
fields 
have 
their 
development 
between 
almost 
zero 
and 
close 
to 
1 
cm 
(limits 
1 
> 
H 
> 
0) 
or 
according 
to 
our 
calculations: 


0.687289278 
cm 
≥ 
λ 
≥ 
1.615979906x10-33 
cm

Logarithmical 
way 
of 
nature 
We 
need 
to 
remember 
that 
nature 
works 
in 
a 
logarithmic 
way, 
and 
that 
the 
extremely 
small 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
extremely 
big. 
For 
nature, 
microcosmos 
space 
is 
similar 
to 
macrocosmos 
space. 
The 
microcosmos 
time, 
when 
the 
Universe 
developed 
all 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
step 
by 
step, 
was 
less 
than 
a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
a 
second. 
For 
human 
minds, 
microcosmos 
time 
is 
almost 
nothing, 
but 
we 
need 
to 
completely 
change 
our 
way 
of 
thinking; 
because 
for 
nature, 
this 
is 
a 
very 
important 
era, 
where 
a 
lot 
of 
different 
and 
important 
events 
happened. 
We 
can 
do 
a 
simple 
exercise: 
The 
logarithmical 
value 
(ln) 
of 
Macrocosmos 
space 
is 
approximately 
74.755; 
the 
frontier 
is 
-0.375 
and 
the 
microscosmos 
space 
is 
-75.505 
and 
so, 
they 
are 
logarithmically 
symmetric. 
In 
effect: 


74.755-(-0.375)=75.13 


-75.505-(-0.375=-75.13 
With 
the 
values 
of 
time: 
50.632, 
-24.499 


50.632-(-24.499)=75.13 


-99.629-(-24.499)=-75.13 
People 
that 
know 
these 
concepts 
need 
to 
apply 
them 
anywhere 
and 
anytime, 
when 
considering 
the 
microcosmos. 
For 
example, 
it 
is 
said 
that 
inflation 
began 
abruptly, 
not 
since 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
but 
after 
an 
infinitesimal 
fraction 
of 
time. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
small 
down 
time 
according 
to 
the 
human 
mind, 
but 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
millions 
of 
years 
according 
to 
nature 
and 
it 
is 
inconvenient 
to 
discard 
it. 
Inflation 
of 
space 
started 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
will 
end 
until 
our 
Universe 
collapses. 
Space 
is 
always 
stretching 
faster 
than 
light. 
Microcosmos 
and 
macrocosmos, 
space 
and 
time 
are, 
logarithmically 
speaking, 
exactly 
inverses; 
and 
consequently, 
logarithmically 
symmetric. 
In 
arithmetical 
values, 
space 
is 
almost 
symmetric 
but 
time 
is 
asymmetric 
and 
we 
need 
to 
put 
the 
square 
of 
Macrocosmos 
time 
in 
order 
for 
it 
to 
be 
approximately 
inverse 
with 
the 
Microcosmos 
time.

Normal 
Higgs 
fields 
and 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
Normal 
Higgs 
fields 
have 
an 
intimal 
relation 
with 
Spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking, 
which 
is 
known 
as 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism. 
The 
fields 
are 
“scalars”, 
which 
means 
that 
they 
do 
not 
point 
in 
any 
direction. 
Each 
Higgs 
field 
is 
specified 
by 
giving 
its 
value, 
a 
single 
number, 
at 
each 
point 
in 
space. 
In 
that 
way, 
there 
are 
only 
three 
normal 
Higgs 
fields 
in 
our 
Universe; 
and 
three 
Higgs 
bosons 
related 
to 
them. 
The 
Higgs 
Weak 
boson 
will 
be 
detected 
in 
the 
new 
LHC 
accelerator 
experiments, 
in 
no 
more 
than 
4.82 
x 
102 
GeV. 
The 
other 
two: 
The 
Higgs 
Strong 
boson 
and 
the 
Higgs 
Gravitational 
boson, 
are 
around 
1016 
and 
1019 
GeV, 
respectively; 
both 
of 
which 
cannot 
be 
observed 
by 
any 
method 
available 
now 
or 
in 
the 
foreseeable 
future. 
The 
Glashow-Weinberg–Salam 
theory 
is 
a 
correct 
theory. 
It 
predicted 
particles 
of 
forces 
W+¸W-and 
Z0 
with 
relatively 
big 
masses. 
The 
included 
photon 
does 
not 
get 
a 
mass; 
and 
one 
particle, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
whose 
role 
is 
producing 
mass 
for 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
W± 
and 
Z0, 
and 
is 
only 
one, 
electrically 
neutral 
and 
spinless. 
All 
the 
suppositions 
have 
been 
proven 
true, 
and 
in 
the 
very 
near 
future, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
will 
appear. 
Its 
discovery 
will 
finally 
clinch 
the 
theory. 
We 
are 
sure 
of 
that. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
although 
very 
successful 
in 
its 
predictions, 
(except 
in 
the 
extremes) 
considered 
that 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
the 
cause 
why 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
also 
get 
mass. 
This 
is 
a 
wrong 
position, 
which 
in 
some 
way, 
we 
explained 
before. 
Particles 
of 
matter 
always 
have 
mass. 
It 
is 
the 
essential 
principle 
of 
quantum 
mechanics, 
according 
to 
the 
uncertainty 
principle. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
need 
to 
modify 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
for 
it 
to 
apply 
not 
only 
in 
Spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking, 
but 
also 
in 
all 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
of 
matter. 



86. 
Higgs 
bosons 
and 
their 
function 
The 
particles 
of 
matter 
always 
have 
mass, 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
or 
without 
it. 
Higgs 
bosons 
give 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
but 
they 
don’t 
have 
any 
participation 
in 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
particles 
of 
matter. 
To 
think 
of 
particles 
of 
matter 
without 
mass, 
existing 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
Universe, 
even 
when 
the 
size 
of 
the 
entire 
Universe 
(h=ct) 
was 
smaller 
than 
the 
size 
of 
any 
known 
particle 
of 
matter, 
has 
no 
sense. 
Neither 
the 
supposition 
that 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
means 
that 
the 
proposition 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
is 
correct. 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
fundamental 
for 
the 
electroweak 
theory. 
It 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
Spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
between 
electromagnetic 
and 
weak 
forces. 
It 
gives 
mass 
to 
W± 
and 
Z0, 
and 
leaves 
the 
photon 
with 
no 
mass. 
It 
also 
leads 
the 
level 
κ-12π 
with 
π 
plus 
(-12 
x 
3.145066939 
= 
-37.75268327 
= 
4.019925255 
x 
10-17) 
= 
√λp 
= 
482.397029 
GeV), 
and 
it 
has 
a 
relation 
with 
top 
and 
bottom 
quarks, 
and 
their 
corresponding 
antimatter; 
and 
nothing 
more. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
God 
particle, 
neither 
is 
its 
role 
to 
give 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter. 



87. 
Modified 
Higgs 
fields 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
all 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
have 
their 
corresponding 
mass, 
according 
to 
the 
relation 
ℏ/cλ=m. 
λ 
is 
obtained 
using 
a 
space 
relation 
we 
described. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
obtain 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
corresponding 
Higgs 
field. 
Its 
relation 
with 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
is 
obtained 
by 
dividing 
its 
value 
by 
specific, 
but 
different 
factors. 
According 
to 
this, 
we 
named 
it 
Modified 
Higgs 
field; 
and 
it 
exists 
in 
the 
obtaining 
of 
mass 
of 
any 
particle, 
whether 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
appears 
or 
not. 
Example: 
electron 
and 
positron

with 
leptons 
are 
simpler).

88. 
Standard 
Model's 
propositions 
about 
Higgs 
boson 
For 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
appear 
when 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
appears, 
at 
√λp=4.019925255 
x 
10-17 
cm, 
(approximately 
4.02 
x 
10-17 
cm). 
And 
in 
consequence, 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
didn’t 
exist 
before 
it. 
To 
confirm 
this 
unclear 
supposition, 
it 
uses 
a 
new 
supposition, 
which 
is 
even 
more 
unclear, 
that 
the 
Higgs 
field 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat, 
and 
so, 
all 
the 
scales 
smaller 
than 
10-17 
have 
the 
same 
known 
particles 
of 
matter, 
but 
without 
mass 
(?!). 
Heat 
can 
destroy 
matter, 
not 
“space”. 
Even 
more, 
Higgs 
fields 
are 
“abstract” 
space. 
In 
any 
way, 
the 
Standard 
Model 
doesn’t 
prove 
why 
heat 
destroys 
the 
Higgs 
field. 
Remember, 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
true 
vacuum 
is 
zero. 
The 
pressure 
of 
the 
false 
vacuum 
must 
be 
negative. 
We 
will 
show, 
according 
to 
the 
calculations 
about 
Higgs 
fields 
that 
Higgs 
fields 
existed 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
era. 
In 
other 
words, 
Higgs 
have 
existed 
from 
cozero 
distance 
until 
little 
less 
than 
one 
centimeter. 
Planck 
length 
is 
the 
minimum 
length 
existing 
in 
our 
Universe, 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
Higgs 
field 
cannot 
operate 
having 
zero 
magnitude, 
neither 
1 
cm, 
or 
more 
than 
1 
cm. 
Higgs 
fields 
bigger 
than 
0.687289278 
cm 
(the 
neutrino 
Higgs 
field) 
cannot 
act, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
a 
new 
Higgs 
field 
with 
λ 
outside 
of 
those 
limits, 
even 
in 
macrocosmic 
scale 
will 
not 
exist 
until 
our 
Universe 
collapses. 
The 
limits 
obtained 
from 
astronomical 
observations 
refer 
to 
a 
state 
with 
large, 
non-zero 
values 
for 
the 
Higgs 
fields. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
produce 
mass 
in 
our 
present 
Universe 
is 
by 
using 
the 
last 
Higgs 
fields 
(and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
longer 
Higgs 
lengths 
of 
the 
first 
family). 
The 
Higgs 
fields 
need 
a 
value 
of 
minus 
zero, 
and 
have 
a 
direct 
relation 
with 
λ. 
The 
logarithmic 
values 
of 
Higgs 
field 
and 
their 
corresponding 
length 
have 
been 
explained 
in 
former 
sections. 
In 
order 
to 
actually 
explain 
the 
existence 
of 
heavy 
particles 
at 
(or 
around) 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
different 
suppositions 
are 
used, 
such 
as: 
a 
new 
mechanism, 
the 
Higgs 
give 
mass 
but 
don't 
pervade 
the 
entire 
Universe; 
a 
new 
supersymmetric 
mechanism, 
etc. 
Remember: 
nature 
prefers 
the 
easiest 
(not 
complicated) 
and 
most 
super-
efficient 
processes. 



89. 
Instability 
of 
Higgs 
bosons 
The 
Higgs 
bosons 
would 
be 
unstable. 
They 
would 
rapidly 
decay 
to 
lighter 
particles, 
which 
would 
interact 
with 
one 
another 
and 
possibly 
undergo 
subsequent 
decays. 
It 
is 
very 
important 
to 
consider 
that 
when 
the 
last 
experiments 
to 
find 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
show 
the 
possible 
results. 
In 
a 
modified 
Higgs 
field 
(with 
no 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking) 
there 
are 
no 
Higgs 
bosons. 
This 
is 
similar 
to 
phase 
changes 
in 
a 
substance 
such 
as 
water. 
The 
heat 
energy 
is 
obtained 
by 
multiplying 
mass, 
the 
specific 
heat 
coefficient, 
and 
the 
change 
in 
temperature; 
but 
in 
the 
interchange 
of 
phases, 
an 
energy 
exists, 
which 
is 
at 
constant 
temperature 
and 
it’s 
named 
latent 
heat 
of 
fusion 
(or 
liquefaction 
or 
vaporization). 
This 
residual 
heat 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
Higgs 
boson, 
which 
exists 
only 
in 
a 
change 
of 
phase 
or 
Spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking. 
The 
Higgs 
boson 
needs 
to 
decay, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
short 
lived. 
Each 
Higgs 
boson 
will 
act 
according 
to 
its 
relation 
with 
its 
corresponding 
force. 
And 
so, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
will 
act 
according 
to 
the 
weak 
force. 



90. 
Higgs 
bosons 
act 
with 
π 
plus 
The 
top 
and 
bottom 
quarks; 
W, 
Z, 
and 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
field 
act 
with 
π 
plus, 
even 
if 
t 
and 
b 
are 
the 
last 
of 
the 
3 
families 
normally 
corresponding 
to 
π 
minus. 
This 
change 
is 
due 
to 
the 
hook 
relation 
between 
different 
scales. 
Acting 
with 
weak 
force 
is 
another 
reason 
why 
the 
top 
quark 
is 
much 
heavier 
than 
the 
other 
members 
of 
the 
family, 
because 
it 
doesn’t 
need 
to 
form 
mesons, 
like 
it 
would 
need 
to 
do 
if 
the 
strong 
force 
would 
act, 
like 
in 
k-11π 
and 
k-10π 
(minus). 


We 
must 
remember 
that 
the 
total 
mass 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
corresponding 
to 
the 
electroweak 
boson 
is 
482.4 
GeV. 
Combining 
t 
and 
b 
and 
their 
antiparticles 
with 
strong 
force 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
form 
mesons, 
and 
so, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
the 
top 
quark 
(t) 
would 
need 
to 
be 
much 
lighter. 
In 
all 
of 
the 
modified 
Higgs 
fields 
without 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking, 
a 
relation 
exists 
with 
the 
corresponding 
particles, 
two 
in 
leptons 
and 
four 
in 
quarks. 
In 
the 
traditional 
Higgs, 
a 
Higgs 
boson 
exists 
with 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
besides 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
and 
matter 
(all 
of 
them 
with 
mass, 
except 
the 
photon).

Difference 
between 
Planck 
and 
electroweak 
scales 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
Planck 
scale 
and 
the 
Electroweak 
scale 
seems 
to 
be 
colossal, 
but 
this 
is 
due 
to 
the 
tendency 
of 
human 
civilization 
to 
use 
arithmetical 
values. 
Nature 
uses 
logarithmical 
values, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
difference 
is 
logical 
and 
acceptable. 
Considering 
as 
an 
example 
one 
of 
the 
more 
fundamentally 
large 
numbers 
in 
physics, 
the 
dimensionless 
ratio 
Mp/Mw 
≅ 
1017, 
where 
Mp 
is 
the 
so 
called 
Planck-mass 
corresponding 
1.2 
x 
1019 
GeV. 
It 
represents 
the 
energy 
at 
which 
quantum 
gravitational 
effects 
begin 
to 
be 
important. 
Mw 
represents 
the 
energy 
where 
the 
electromagnetic 
and 
weak 
forces 
are 
separated 
and 
both 
acquire 
their 
own 
identity. 
Theorists 
would 
like 
to 
have 
the 
exact 
value 
of 
that 
ratio 
and 
to 
explain 
why 
is 
the 
difference 
“so 
big”. 
Supersymmetry 
tries 
to 
give 
two 
complicated 
answers, 
but 
the 
answer 
can 
be 
much 
simpler. 
1° 
The 
exact 
value 
is: 
(Mplank)/(MWeak)= 
(1.200014922 
x 
1019)/(4.82397029 
x 
102)= 
2.487608443 
x 
1016 


= 
log(16.39578202) 
=ln(37.75268327) 
Or 
using 
the 
inverse 
of 
the 
square 
root 
of 
Planck 
length: 
1/√(1.615979906 
x 
10-33) 
= 
2.487608442 
x 
1016 


Besides 
that, 
the 
colossal 
difference 
disappears, 
using 
logarithmical 
scale. 


(Planck 
Length)/(Electroweak 
length) 
= 
(1.615979906 
x 
10-33)/(4.019925255 
x10-17) 
= 
ln(75.50536654)/ln(37.75268327) 


Relation 
= 
2 
(In 
logarithmical 
system) 
In 
arithmetical 
system, 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
obtain 
the 
square 
root 
of 
Planck 
length 
or 
(electroweak 
length)2=λp. 



92. 
Level 
of 
electromagnetic 
force 
According 
to 
the 
union 
of 
these 
4 
forces, 
they 
produce 
3 
Higgs 
bosons 
when 
they 
are 
separated. 
Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
level 
of 
electromagnetic 
force 
is 
K-20π, 
but 
this 
force 
accompanies 
the 
electroweak 
force, 
until 
its 
level 
in 
K-12π. 
The 
photon 
never 
obtains 
mass 
and 
will 
always 
have 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest. 
(It 
is 
possible 
to 
produce 
a 
BEC 
(Bose-Einstein 
Condensate) 
of 
photons, 
but 
this 
is 
different 
to 
obtaining 
a 
photon 
with 
mass 
at 
rest.) 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
photino 
doesn’t 
exist. 
In 
electroweak 
theory, 
there 
are 
four 
particles 
of 
forces 
integrating 
it: 
W+, 
W-, 
Z0, 
and 
γ 
(photon), 
the 
last 
one 
with 
no 
mass 
at 
rest. 
It 
may 
be 
that 
Z0, 
using 
only 
one 
place, 
is 
a 
mixture 
of 
two 
Z0, 
like 
the 
neutral 
pion 
π0 
(uū+d¯d). 
We 
know 
that 
the 
simplest 
set 
of 
particles 
would 
be 
a 
triplet, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
three 
dimensions 
in 
which 
three 
rotations 
act. 
Mathematically, 
this 
would 
have 
been 
possible; 
but 
experimentally, 
the 
leptons 
and 
quarks 
group 
themselves 
into 
doublets, 
not 
triplets, 
so 
far 
the 
weak 
force 
is 
concerned. 
In 
the 
theory, 
there 
is 
only 
one 
Z0 
as 
well 
as 
one 
photon. 
For 
there 
to 
be 
“room” 
for 
the 
photon 
we 
need 
to 
put 
only 
one 
Z0 
in 
the 
equations, 
and 
so, 
the 
four 
particles 
of 
force 
are: 
photon 
(with 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest), 
W+, 
W-, 
and 
Z0 
(with 
known 
masses). 



93. 
Microcosmos 
range; 
detailed 
graphs 
The 
microcosmos 
exists 
between 
e∅ 
(e-0.375) 
and 
the 
minimum 
length 
(Planck 
length)= 
e-75.50536654. 
In 
that 
way, 
in 
a 
normal 
relation 
(horizontal 
geometrical 
relation) 
all 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
would 
have 
direct 
relation 
with 
Planck 
length, 
and 
so 
with 
π 
plus 
or 
-3.146056939. 



Notwithstanding, 
the 
geometrical 
relation 
has 
a 
slope: 
one 
step 
in 
Higgs 
is 
equivalent 
to 
two 
steps 
in 
cosmic 
scale 
(in 
logarithmical 
measure). 
And 
so, 



after 
κ-12π 
(at 
the 
half 
of 
the 
microcosmos), 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
forms 
a 
new 
scale; 
which 
is 
related 
to 
the 
macrocosmos, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
has 
a 
direct 
relation 
with 
the 
Maximum, 
and 
so, 
with 
π 
minus. 
It 
is 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
two 
scales, 
almost 
symmetrically 
related, 
with 
a 
small, 
but 
crucial 
asymmetry, 
using 
π 
plus 
and 
π 
minus, 
at 
κ-12π 
and 
not 
at 
κ-0π. 
Higgs 
is 
the 
place 
of 
division, 
but 
there 
is 
not 
only 
one 
frontier, 
there 
are 
two: 
one 
at 
κ-12π 
plus 
and 
the 
other, 
κ-12π 
minus, 
at 
ln(-37.75268327) 
and 
ln(-37.37768327), 
or 
4.019925255x10-17 
and 
5.848956734x10-17 
cm. 
respectively. 



94. 
Order 
of 
appearance 
of 
particles 
of 
matter; 
hook 
relation 
Each 
scale 
is 
composed 
by 
three 
families, 
in 
this 
order: 
• 
neutrino1 
• 
neutrino2 
• 
neutrino3 
• 
electron1 


• 
quarks 
u, 
d 
• 
quarks 
c, 
s 
• 
quarks 
t, 
b 
The 
other 
2 
electrons 
and 
the 
other 
composite 
particles 
are 
included 
along 
quarks. 
Another 
scale 
would 
have 
similar 
particles, 
only 
much 
heavier, 
probably 
with 
spin 
1/2 
(with 
angular 
momentum), 
but 
inverse 
helicity; 
that 
we 
call 
heavy 
partners 
but 
perhaps 
with 
symmetry 
about 
spins, 
that 
actual 
physics 
call 
superpartners. 
In 
any 
way, 
their 
masses 
are 
similar, 
and 
are 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections. 
Due 
to 
the 
relation 
with 
inverse 
limits 
(Planck 
and 
Maximum), 
we 
must 
clarify 
once 
again 
that 
there 
is 
a 
hook 
between 
the 
last 
term 
of 
the 
first 
scale 
(t,b) 
with 
the 
first 
term 
of 
the 
second 
scale 
(Neutronio, 
Antineutronio), 
joining 
both 
scales. 
And 
so, 
the 
neutronio 
will 
use 
π 
minus; 
and 
t 
and 
b 
will 
use 
π 
plus. 
In 
the 
figures, 
it 
is 
the 
same 
line, 
but 
with 
a 
small 
difference 
in 
space, 
according 
to 
the 
triangle 
(in 
2 
spatial 
dimensions, 
for 
simplicity), 
or 
cone 
(in 
3 
spatial 
dimension 
+ 
movement). 
Neutrinos 
(1, 
2, 
3) 
are 
produced 
in 
stars 
like 
the 
Sun 
and 
even 
in 
supernovas. 
But 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies, 
which 
are 
surrounded 
by 
millions 
of 
stars 
moving 
at 
enormous 
speeds 
around 
a 
supermassive 
black 
hole 
(with 
a 
mass 
of 
hundreds 
of 
millions 
and 
even 
billions 
of 
the 
Sun’s 
mass), 
instead 
of 
neutrino-antineutrino 
pairs, 
neutronio-antineutronio 
pairs 
are 
produced 
thanks 
to 
the 
colossal 
gravity 
there. 
By 
means 
of 
a 
Penrose-Hawking 
process, 
the 
antineutronios 
go 
inside 
the 
black 
hole 
and 
the 
neutronios 
are 
left 
alone 
in 
the 
Universe, 
forming 
halos 
of 
dark 
matter 
that 
join 
the 
galaxies. 

The 
neutronios 
would 
be 
totally 
stable 
because 
they 
are 
the 
lightest 
heavy 
partner 
(there 
is 
not 
a 
lighter 
particle 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale). 
Moreover, 
the 
neutronio 
is 
the 
only 
particle 
of 
the 
second 
scale 
constituted 
in 
concordance 
with 
π 
minus 
(the 
Maximum’s 
sphere 
of 
influence), 
and 
in 
consequence 
it 
can 
live 
almost 
forever 
in 
harmony 
in 
our 
macrocosmos.In 
effect: 



And 
so, 
a 
hook 
is 
formed, 
which 
was 
explained 
before, 
in 
both 
scales: 
Neutronio 
(above) 
and 
t, 
b 
(below). 



The 
search 
for 
the 
Neutronio 
at 
approximately 
132 
GeV 
(the 
first 
heavy-
partner) 
and 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
at 
around 
482.4 
GeV, 
(but 
no 
less 
than 
384 
GeV) 
is 
essential 
in 
the 
LHC. 
If 
the 
experiments 
at 
LHC 
confirm 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
Higgs 
boson 
at 
around 
132 
GeV, 
instead 
of 
the 
LSP 
(or 
the 
LHP), 
it 
would 
be 
only 
a 
light 
Higgs 
boson. 
It 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
find 
a 
heavier 
Higgs 
boson, 
preferably 
between 
384-482.4 
GeV. 
But 
at 
around 
132 
GeV, 
our 
first 
option 
is 
the 
neutronio. 



95. 
Backwards 
time 
travel. 
Wormholes 
between 
Universes 
Quantum 
mechanics 
accepts 
backward 
time 
travel; 
but 
this 
is 
only 
true 
for 
particles 
(with 
some 
restrictions), 
where 
the 
quantum 
waves 
act. 
In 
aggregated 
matter, 
heavier 
than 
gravitational 
mass 
or 
Mp/√(8π)=2.393659682 
x1018 
GeV 
or 
4.342115729 
x10-6 
g, 
where 
the 
gravitational 
waves 
act, 
backward 
time 
travel 
is 
physically 
impossible. 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
both 
waves 
are 
real 
and 
equal 
only 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang; 
after 
that, 
only 
one 
of 
them 
is 
real, 
while 
the 
other 
one 
is 
virtual. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
have 
an 
apparent 
solution 
by 
using 
black 
holes. 
The 
Penrose 
diagram 
consists 
of 
a 
negative 
Universe 
and 
a 
positive 
one, 
separated 
by 
a 
ring–cosingularity, 
through 
which, 
anything 
could 
travel 
from 
one 
Universe 
to 
the 
other. 
The 
original 
diagram 
was 
a 
ring-singularity, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
we 
could 
have 
a 
naked 
Kerr 
singularity. 
According 
to 
a 
former 
section, 
the 
ring 
cosingularity 
exists 
at 
the 
Big-Bang 
and 
would 
be 
approximately 
similar 
in 
the 
center 
of 
any 
Black 
hole, 
considering 
the 
singularity 
is 
a 
cosingularity 
of 
Planck 
length 
size, 
as 
is 
accepted 
now 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
frontier 
is 
not 
a 
point, 
but 
a 
ring. 
However, 
the 
size 
of 
this 
“wormhole” 
is 
only 
Planck 
size; 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
only 
particles 
(and 
the 
heaviest) 
of 
antimatter, 
could 
pass 
to 
the 
negative 
Universe. 
We 
explained 
this 
before, 
when 
we 
were 
talking 
about 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
and 
CPT 
symmetry. 
Another 
way 
to 
do 
it 
is 
by 
using 
lighter 
particles 
with 
the 
quantum 
tunneling 
effect; 
with 
an 
average 
wave 
as 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
composed 
by 
a 
retarded 
wave 
(particle), 
and 
an 
advanced 
wave 
(antiparticle), 
FTL. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
in 
the 
last 
sections 
of 
this 
book. 



96. 
Accelerators 
as 
time 
machines. 
Arrows 
of 
time 
Right 
now, 
time-machines 
are 
a 
reality; 
and 
we 
are 
even 
using 
some 
now. 
Their 
name: 
the 
particle 
accelerators 
(or 
Colliders). 
But, 
only 
particles 
can 
travel 
backward 
in 
time. 
We 
know 
that 
particles 
came 
from 
heavier 
to 
lighter, 
from 
the 
Big 
Bang 
until 
now. 
Now, 
only 
the 
First 
family 
exists 
in 
present 
time, 
the 
lightest 
particles 
(and 
maybe 
the 
lightest 
particle 
of 
the 
second 
scale). 
The 
natural 
process 
starts 
from 
κ-24π 
(or 
κ-12π, 
according 
to 
the 
Standard 
Model) 
to 
κ-∅π. 
Accelerators 
act 
in 
inverse 
processes, 
carrying 
the 
particles 
to 
the 
past. 
When 
they 
were 
formed, 
appearing 
like 
relics 
of 
the 
past, 
they 
carry 
them 
to 
an 
even 
more 
remote 
past 
time, 
depending 
on 
the 
power 
of 
the 
accelerators. 
Right 
now, 
they 
are 
trying 
to 
find 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson. 
With 
more 
powerful 
accelerators, 
the 
Higgs 
strong 
boson 
will 
appear 
at 
energies 
of 
orders 
of 
1014~1016 
GeV; 
and 
the 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
will 
appear 
at 
energies 
of 
1018~1019 
GeV, 
the 
same 
as 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
In 
the 
microcosmos, 
there 
are 
two 
arrows 
of 
time, 
and 
in 
the 
macrocosmos 
there 
is 
only 
one. 
Besides 
that, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
put 
in 
reverse 
the 
macrocospic 
arrow 
of 
time. 
Time 
will 
always 
go 
to 
the 
future, 
with 
the 
entropy 
always 
increasing. 
Using 
sophisticated 
and 
more 
powerful 
telescopes, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
see 
the 
past 
in 
remotes 
stars 
or 
even 
planets, 
but 
it 
will 
only 
be 
possible 
using 
waves, 
not 
aggregated 
matter. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
travel 
to 
the 
past 
using 
our 
physical 
body. 



In 
cosmic 
scale, 
we 
can 
accelerate 
the 
future, 
and 
even 
arrive 
physically 
in 
the 
future, 
but 
we 
cannot 
physically 
return 
backwards 
in 
time. 
In 
that 
way, 
time 
paradoxes 
don’t 
exist; 
and 
we 
can't 
change 
the 
past. 
Einstein 
was 
right, 
but 
the 
quantum 
physicists 
were 
also 
right. 
The 
difference 
is 
in 
the 
paradox 
of 
measure. 
When 
does 
the 
incoherent 
quantum 
waves 
act 
and 
when 
does 
the 
coherent 
gravitational 
waves 
act 
instead? 
We 
explained 
these 
concepts 
before.

Axions

exist. 
Supposed 
mass 
equal 
to 
neutrino's 
mass 
The 
hypothetical 
particle, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
like 
dark 
matter, 
the 
invisible 
axion, 
doesn’t 
exist. 
However 
it 
is 
important 
to 
mention 
that 
its 
supposed 
mass 
of 
10-5 
eV 
or 
10-14 
GeV 
is 
practically 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
neutrino 
(the 
lightest 
particle 
existing 
in 
the 
Universe). 
With 
a 
length 
of 
its 
corresponding 
Higgs 
field 
of 
0.6872789278 
cm, 
maintaining 
a 
Higgs 
field 
mass 
of 
approx. 
2.821519351 
x10-14 
GeV, 
and 
in 
consequence 
a 
neutrino1 
(electron-neutrino) 
mass 
has 
1.125623364 
x10-14 
GeV 
(dividing 
is

field 
by 
√(2π)).

Theoretical 
proton 
decay 
time 
The 
most 
celebrated 
passive 
and 
non-accelerator 
experiment 
is 
proton-decay. 
As 
explained 
before, 
its 
time 
of 
supposed 
decay 
is 
much 
longer 
than 
the 
life 
of 
our 
Universe. 
The 
entire 
Universe 
will 
collapse 
and 
all 
will 
be 
destroyed 
before 
that 
time 
is 
reached. 
But 
analyzing 
the 
heavier 
scale, 
we 
note 
that 
heavier 
quarks 
exist, 
uh 
and 
dh, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
probability 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
heavier 
protons 
and 
neutrons, 
in 
the 
remote 
past 
of 
our 
Universe, 
increases. 


They 
are 
definitely 
very 
short 
lived, 
so 
we 
would 
not 
expect 
to 
observe 
relics 
of 
them 
remaining 
from 
the 
past. 
However, 
with 
more 
powerful 
accelerators 
in 
the 
future 
(a 
distant 
one) 
and 
according 
to 
both 
ways 
of 
the 
arrow 
of 
time 
in 
quantum 
mechanics, 
we 
will 
eventually 
find 
them. 
This 
heavy-proton 
corresponds 
with 
the 
proton-decay 
mentioned, 
with 
a 
much 
shorter 
time, 
but 
with 
a 
logical 
and 
measurable 
decay. 
After 
the 
LHC, 
we 
don´t 
recommend 
building 
more 
powerful 
accelerators 
in 
the 
near 
future; 
the 
next 
appearance 
of 
new 
particles 
is 
too 
far 
out 
of 
our 
reach 
at 
the 
moment; 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
change 
our 
points 
of 
view 
to 
build 
new 
accelerators, 
changing 
the 
type 
of 
technology 
or 
finding 
new 
natural 
sources 
of 
study 
of 
natural 
astronomical 
phenomena. 


Using 
metals 
and 
solid 
materials 
is 
an 
“old” 
technology, 
like 
the 
traditional 
method 
of 
action-reaction, 
burning 
oil 
or 
other 
fuels, 
used 
in 
transportation 
machines. 
The 
new 
technologies 
need 
to 
be 
radically 
different, 
analyzing 
the 
way 
nature 
works. 
We 
need 
to 
completely 
change 
our 
way 
of 
thinking.

Four 
massed 
neutrinos. 
Neutronio 
as 
dark 
matter 
The 
formation 
of 
particles 
since 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
depends 
on 
the 
moment 
when 
the 
corresponding 
Higgs 
field 
is 
formed. 
The 
particles 
produced 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
or 
in 
similarly 
remote 
eras, 
do 
not 
exist 
now, 
except 
for 
the 
lightest 
ones 
in 
the 
scale. 
We 
also 
cannot 
affirm 
that 
the 
present 
particles 
were 
formed 
at 
the 
former 
eras, 
when 
the 
size 
of 
the 
visible 
Universe 
was 
even 
smaller 
than 
even 
one 
of 
these 
particle. 
In 
that 
way, 
to 
say 
that 
neutrinos 
produced 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
permeated 
the 
Universe 
and 
contributed 
to 
the 
total 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
a 
wrong 
position, 
because 
all 
kinds 
of 
neutrinos 
were 
produced 
after 
that. 
Cosmologists 
have 
suggested 
that 
Cosmology 
may 
be 
consistent 
with 
three 


or 
four 
massed 
neutrinos. 
The 
existence 
of 
a 
fourth 
neutrino, 
that 
we 
have 
named 
neutronio, 
is 
the 
lightest 
particle 
of 
the 
proposed 
heavier 
scale 
(which 
isn't 
accepted 
by 
the 
Standard 
Model). 
Even 
though 
pair 
neutrino-antineutrino 
is 
unstable, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
separate 
them 
in 
big 
quantities 
using 
black 
holes; 
and 
the 
neutronio 
alone, 
could 
exist 
in 
a 
stable 
form, 
as 
dark 
matter, 
around 
galaxies, 
forming 
a 
cloud 
around 
them. 
Even 
if 
a 
particle 
alone 
has 
no 
measurable 
gravitational 
effect, 
a 
cloud 
(similar 
to 
a 
big 
school 
of 
fishes, 
which 
act 
in 
a 
different 
way 
than 
a 
single 
fish) 
could 
add 
a 
gravitational 
effect 
because 
its 
united 
mass 
would 
be 
like 
the 
one 
of 
a 
single 
unit. 
The 
neutrinos 
permeate 
the 
entire 
Universe 
and 
travel 
fluently 
almost 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
Their 
masses 
(placed 
together 
like 
a 
single 
unit) 
contribute 
to 
the 
total 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe. 
But 
its 
individual 
mass 
is 
almost 
negligible, 
at 
around 
1.125609369 
x10-14 
GeV 
equivalent 
to 
2.0355 
x10-38 
g 
approx. 
Its 
contribution, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
a 
big 
number, 
is 
insufficient. 
Neutronio2 
and 
Neutronio3 
are 
unstable 
and 
disappear 
after 
a 
short-lived 
term. 
The 
Neutronio1's 
mass 
is 
around 
132.2678389 
GeV 
or 
2.391823489x10-22 
g, 
which 
is 
141 
times 
heavier 
than 
the 
known 
proton. 
In 
case 
it 
exists, 
it 
won’t 
travel 
as 
the 
neutrino1 
(the 
cozero 
particle, 
the 
lightest 
particle 
in 
the 
Universe). 
The 
supposed 
neutronio 
would 
be 
the 
lightest 
particle 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale 



and 
could 
be 
stable 
(remember 
it 
is 
not 
the 
4th 
neutrino, 
it 
is 
the 
first 
of 
another 
scale). 
Its 
big 
mass 
prevents 
it 
to 
travel 
around 
the 
Universe, 
and 
it 
could 
be 
almost 
stopped 
around 
galaxies, 
and 
would 
participate 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
dark 
matter. 


The 
neutrino 
(massed) 
is 
practically 
a 
reality. 
The 
neutronio 
(with 
a 
big 
mass) 
would 
only 
be 
a 
probability. 



101. 
Cosmological 
"constant" 
decrease 
in 
time. 
Its 
energy 
increases 
Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
never 
was, 
is, 
or 
will 
be 
zero. 
In 
that 
position, 
the 
concept 
that 
zero 
is 
by 
far 
its 
most 
probable 
value, 
is 
a 
mistake. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
is 
permanently 
variable; 
it 
had 
its 
maximum 
value 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
Universe 
and 
will 
have 
its 
minimum 
value 
at 
the 
last 
event 
of 
it, 
when 
the 
maximum 
expansion 
of 
our 
Universe 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
will 
end. 
Its 
formula 
is 
very 
simple: 
Λ 
= 
6/R2. 
However, 
even 
if 
its 
value 
diminishes 
with 
time, 
the 
energy 
due 
to 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
increases 
with 
time. 
The 
formula 
of 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
is: 
EΛ 
=(1/6)ΛmR2c2 


Λ 
decreases, 
but 
m 
and 
R2 
increase 
even 
more. 



102. 
Four 
kinds 
of 
energy. 
Mass 
increase 
but 
no 
net 
change 
The 
increase 
of 
this 
energy 
is 
in 
accordance 
to 
the 
Law 
of 
Conservation 
of 
Energy 
of 
the 
Universe, 
because 
there 
are 
four 
energies 
in 
it: 
two 
positives 
and 
two 
negatives. 
The 
four 
energies 
can 
change 
only 
if 
the 
final 
result 
remains 
unchanged, 
as 
we 
can 
see 
in 
reality. 
The 
result 
would 
be 
practically 
zero, 
or 
in 
better 
terms, 
almost 
zero 
(cozero). 
This 
minimum 
difference 
consists 
in 
quantum 
uncertainty 
(or 
quantum 
fluctuation) 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
with 
mathematical 
expressions 
in 
the 
approximated 
values 
of 
the 
formulas. 
The 
representations 
of 
the 
four 
formulas 
are: 


➢ 
Em=mc2 
(Matter 
Energy): 
Positive. 
➢ 
EG≅ 
(-Rc4)/G≅(-Gmm')/R 
(Gravitational 
Energy): 
Negative. 
➢ 
Ec=(1/2)mv2 
(Kinetic 
Energy): 
Positive. 
➢ 
EΛ 
=(-1/6)Λmr2c2 
(Cosmologic 
Constant 
Energy): 
Negative 
➢ 
Etotal= 
mc2+(1/2)mv2-(Rc4)/G-(1/6)Λmr2c2=0 
or 
almost 
0. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
each 
of 
the 
formula 
of 
the 
four 
energies 
can 
be 
transformed 
into 
Einstein's 
formula 
E=mc2. 

103. 
Experimental 
value 
of 
Λ 
and 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
The 
experimental 
value 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
is, 
right 
now, 
Λ=<3 
x10-56 
cm-2. 
To 
obtain 
this 
value 
theoretically, 
as 
exactly 
as 
possible, 
is 
the 
best 
way 
to 
know 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe. 
According 
to 
the 
formula: 


Λ=6/R2, 
and 
with 
the 
former 
experimental 
results, 
the 
calculations 
to 
obtain 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
6/R2 
< 
3x10-56 
cm-2 
or 
2 
x1056 
cm2 
< 
R2 
and 
so: 


1.414213562 
x1028 
cm 
< 
R 
4.717308673 
x1017 
s 
< 
t 
1.494833919 
x1010 
years 
< 
t 
So, 
if 
the 
experimental 
value 
of 
the 
actual 
Cosmological 
“constant” 
is 
correct, 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
would 
approximately 
be 
15 
billion 
years, 
instead 
of 


13.7 
to 
14 
billion, 
like 
the 
last 
cosmological 
calculations 
determine. 
(If 
13.7 
billion 
years 
is 
correct, 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
needs 
to 
be 
3.57 
x10-56 
cm-2). 
However, 
those 
new 
calculations 
use 
many 
experimental 
results; 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
the 
margin 
of 
error 
increases. 
The 
high 
– 
Z 
– 
team 
performed 
a 
calculation, 
and 
found 
that 
the 
Universe 
has 
an 
age 
of 
12.8 
~ 
14.6 
Gyr, 
with 
a 
maximum 
value 
close 
to 
15.0 
Gyr. 
We 
will 
discuss 
these 
new 
calculations 
in 
a 
next 
section. 
Notwithstanding, 
the 
differences 
between 
13.7 
or 
14.6 
or 
15 
Gyr 
are 
minimal, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
life 
of 
our 
Universe. 
As 
explained 
before, 
the 
maximum 
space 
will 
be 
2.923096699 
x1032 
cm 
and 
the 
whole 
life 
of 
the 
universe, 
9.750401056 
x1021 
s 
or 
3.0839734259 
x1014 
years. 
A 
difference 
of 
1 
Gyr 
would 
only 
be 
a 
minimal 
fraction 
of 
the 
whole 
life 
of 
the 
Universe. 
(0,00000324 
or 
0.000324%) 

104. 
Importance 
of 
microcosmos 
time 
Nevertheless, 
we 
must 
insist 
that 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
logarithmical. 
And 
so, 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
which 
in 
arithmetical 
time 
is 
only 
a 
infinitesimal 
fraction 
of 
a 
second, 
is 
even 
more 
important 
than 
the 
14 
or 
15 
billions 
of 
years 
that 
our 
human 
measure 
considers 
until 
now. 
Using 
time 
or 
space, 
(we 
can 
obtain 
it 
multiplying 
c 
times 
t) 
we 
have 
the 
following 
values: 


➢ 
ln 
Planck 
length 
(Big 
Bang) 
= 
-75.50536654 
➢ 
ln 
1.5 
Gyr 
length 
= 
+64.8224061 
➢ 
ln 
1.4 
Gyr 
length 
= 
+64.75341332 
➢ 
ln 
Maximum 
length 
(Big-Crush) 
= 
+74.75536654 
➢ 
ln 
Maximum 
space 
of 
Microcosmos 
=

(∅) 
(0.687289278

Natural 
logarithmical 
difference 
between: 


Maximum 
and 
minimum

150.2607331 
Difference 
between 
1.5 
Gyr 
and 
1.4 
Gyr 
space 
=0.06899287 
Macrocosmos 
era: 
74.75536654-(-0.375)=75.13036654 
Microcosmos 
Era: 
-0.375-(-75.50536654)=75.13036654 
But 
the 
microcosmos 
and 
macrocosmos 
are 
totally 
symmetric, 
logarithmically 
speaking, 
with 
the 
space 
until 
the 
last 
event, 
and 
not 
only 
the 
space 
of 
the 
actual 
age 
of 
the 
Universe. 
In 
our 
human 
arrogance, 
we 
use 
arithmetical 
time, 
and 
we 
like 
to 
think 
that 
Humanity 
is 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
Universe 
(sometimes 
even 
the 
most 
important), 
using 
a 
strong 
anthropic 
principle. 
But 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe, 
we 
are 
almost 
nothing, 
and 
all 
the 
time 
of 
Humanity 
in 
the 
Universe 
will 
eventually 
be 
insignificant. 



105. 
Mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
increases 
with 
time 
We 
can 
observe 
that, 
although 
the 
Conservation 
of 
Energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
remains 
unchanged; 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
increases 
with 
time. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
mass-energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
increases 
with 
time. 
This 
is 
like 
this, 
because 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
even 
though 
it 
had 
maximum 
density 
and 
maximum 
heat, 
also 
had 
minimum 
energy, 
and 
so, 
it 
had 
minimum 
mass. 
In 
effect, 



So, 
Planck 
energy 
is 
the 
maximum 
energy 
for 
a 
Higgs 
field 
forming 
particles, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
the 
minimum 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
maximum 
mass 
for 
a 
particle 
would 
be: 
Planck 
mass/√(8π) 
= 
2.393653682 
x1018 
GeV, 
approx. 
2.4 
x1018 
GeV 
or 
4.34208778 
x10-6 
g

Relation 
of 
space 
and 
time 
with 
Λ 
Theoretical 
physicists 
have 
been 
analyzing 
for 
years 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
almost 
cancellation 
of 
the 
total 
cosmological 
constant, 
without 
finding 
a 
convincing 
explanation. 
First 
of 
all, 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
is 
not 
a 
constant 
but 
a 
variable. 
Second, 
the 
actual 
concept 
is 
that 
the 
cosmic 
repulsion 
increases 
at 
longer 
distances; 
and 
moreover, 
that 
at 
small 
distances 
the 
Λ 
is 
negligible 
and 
it 
is 
overwhelmed 
by 
the 
gravitational 
attraction. 
This 
affirmation 
can 
take 
us 
to 
a 
wrong 
conclusion: 
that 
the 
cosmic 
repulsion, 
when 
the 
universe 
was 
considerably 
smaller, 
was 
practically 
inexistent.Λ 
increases 
as 
distance 
increases, 
only 
while 
time 
remains 
constant; 
and 
it 
decreases 
with 
time, 
even 
if 
the 
universe 
gets 
larger. 


The 
gravitational 
attraction 
had 
a 
colossal 
influence 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
with 
a 
large 
energy 
density, 
and 
if 
the 
Λ 
is 
considered 
negligible 
in 
that 
moment, 
a 
scientific 
paradox 
could 
be 
derived. 
It 
is 
not 
like 
this, 
it 
is 
just 
the 
opposite. 
What 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
Big 
Bang 
and 
its 
tremendous 
expansion? 
The 
normal 
idea 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
was 
that 
there 
was 
a 
strong 
explosion 
of 
colossal 
force. 
There 
is 
no 
convincing 
explanation 
for 
this, 
but 
this 
is 
considered 
ad-hoc 
as 
a 
prefixed 
condition. 
For 
a 
theory 
to 
be 
a 
good 
one, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
little 
to 
no 
preconditions. 
The 
explanations 
need 
to 
appear 
naturally 
during 
the 
development 
of 
any 
theory. 
This 
explosion 
needs 
to 
be 
substituted 
by 
a 
silent 
(like 
most 
phenomena 
of 
nature) 
Higgs 
expansion, 
with 
cozero 
space, 
cofinite 
density 
of 
energy, 
and 
cozero 
entropy, 
at 
Planck 
length, 
in 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
one 
time. 


The 
expansion 
of 
our 
universe 
is 
a 
natural 
condition 
of 
any 
odd 
spatial 
dimension-Universe 
and 
it 
will 
continue 
to 
expand 
permanently 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
way, 
until 
it 
reaches 
its 
maximum 
space, 
that 
is 
equivalent 
to: 
Rmax 
= 
α/R, 
where 
α 
= 
e-0.75 
in 
our 
Universe, 
and 
it 
will 
begin 
to 
close, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension, 
in 
a 
fractal 
way. 
The 
complete 
procedure 
has 
been 
explained 
before. 
Since 
there 
are 
three 
dimensions 
of 
space, 
the 
negative 
pressure 
of 
the 
inflationary 
vacuum 
operates 
in 
six 
directions 
(three 
dimensions), 
making 
the 
repulsive 
“gravitational” 
effect 
larger 
than 
the 
gravitational 
attraction 
(produced 
by 
the 



energy 
density 
of 
vacuum). 
So, 
the 
inflationary 
vacuum 
state 
produces 
an 
overall 
repulsion, 
which 
is 
constantly 
maintained 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe, 
at 
approximately 
9.7504 
x1021 
s. 
Now, 
there 
is 
a 
residual 
vacuum 
energy 
density 
and 
a 
small 
cosmological 
constant, 
the 
universe's 
expansion 
continue 
to 
accelerate, 
even 
if 
Λ 
diminishes, 
but 
the 
gravitational 
attraction 
also 
diminishes. 
The 
critical 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
valid 
only 
under 
the 
usual 
assumption 
that 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
is 
zero, 
but 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
will 
always 
have 
a 
nonzero 
value. 



107. 
Restrictions 
of 
the 
Universe 
According 
to 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
Universe, 
(two 
cosmic 
restrictions 
exist 
in 
each) 
we 
can 
draw 
a 
figure 
connected 
with 
the 
traditional 
“hook” 
between 
two 
fundamental 
moduli 
(the 
first 
modulus, 
in 
minimum 
limits 
and 
in 


maximumlimits).
In 
logarithmical 
terms, 
minimum 
limits 
are 
positive 
only 
in 
one-dimensional 
space-time 
Universe 
(0+1), 
the 
others 
have 
negative 
values. 
In 
maximum 
limits, 
the 
limit 
is 
negative 
only 
in 
one-dimensional 
space-time 
Universe 
(0+1). 
The 
other 
ones 
have 
positive 
values. 
For 
example, 
our 
Universe 
(like 
any 
different 
dimensional 
Universe) 
has 
two 
fundamental 
restrictions 
relative 
to 
space. 
(And 
all 
the 
different 
measures 
are 
derived 
from 
space). 
No 
entity 
(not 
even 
space 
as 
a 
whole) 
can 
have, 
travel, 
or 
decrease 
to 
a 
length 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
(1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm); 
nor 
larger 
than 
the 
maximum 
limit 
(2.923096699x1032cm). 
All 
the 
other 
cosmic 



restrictions 
are 
derived 
from 
them 
(maximum 
and 
minimum: 
in 
mass, 
energy, 
time, 
Λ, 
temperature, 
density, 
area, 
volume, 
etc). 
With 
the 
cosmic 
restriction, 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
a 
naked 
singularity 
to 
exist 
in 
the 
Universe. 
This 
is 
because 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
any 
distance 
smaller 
than 
λp 
to 
exist. 
The 
basic 
constants 
of 
our 
universe 
are: 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c. 
The 
photon 
is 
the 
only 
particle 
that 
is 
always 
massless 
at 
rest, 
and 
this 
never 
changes. 
A 
photon 
is 
always 
a 
photon; 
in 
the 
macrocosmos, 
in 
the 
microcosmos; 
in 
the 
light 
scale, 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale; 
and 
even 
in 
the 
corresponding 
anti-matter 
Universe. 
But, 
photons 
will 
end 
with 
the 
end 
of 
our 
universe. 
And 
it 
is 
the 
graviton, 
the 
particle 
that 
unites 
universes, 
by 
decreasing 
or 
increasing 
its 
force 
(it 
depends 
on 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions). 
Gravity 
is 
the 
entrance 
and 
the 
exit 
door 
for 
any 
Universe. 



108. 
Higgs 
fields 
equations 
According 
to 
Higgs 
field 
equations, 
E=M2H2+AH4 
E 
and 
M2 
are 
negative, 
and 
so 
M2H2>AH4 
M2>AH2 
The 
quanta 
of 
Higgs 
field 
is 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
particles, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
M2 
can 
be 
substituted 
by 
(ℏ/cλ)2 
and 
so: 
ℏ2/(c2λ2H2)>A 


Besides 
that, 
M2H2 
is 
an 
energy 
term 
and 
so, 
it 
has 
a 
mathematical 
relation 
with 
mc2: 


M2H2=Mc2 
H2=c2/M 
M=ℏ/cλ 
H2=(c2cλ)/ℏ 
= 
(c3λ)/ℏ 


Because 
c 
and 
ℏ 
are 
constants, 
H2 
and 
H, 
are 
directly 
proportional 
to 
λ. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
can 
substitute 
H 
by 
λ 
in 
the 
graph. 
The 
result: 
The 
Higgs 
field 
is 
negative 
(and 
in 
consequence 
active) 
from 
Planck 
(not 
zero) 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
(almost 
1 
cm). 
Moreover, 
we 
know 
that: 


ℏ2/(c2λ2H2)>A 
Substituting 
H2: 
(ℏ2ℏ)/(c2λ2c3λ)>A 


ℏ3/(c5λ3)>A 


A 
is 
a 
positive 
constant 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
the 
equation 
is 
correct 
while 
λ 
is 
smaller 
and 
non-zero. 
It 
would 
be 
wrong 
for 
λ 
to 
increase 
in 
size 
to 
one 
larger 
than 
the 
maximum 
value. 
The 
equation 
shows 
us 
a 
simple 
result: 
Higgs 
fields 
have 
a 
negative 
energy 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
they 
are 
active 
when 
λ 
is 
smaller; 
consequently, 
if 
it 
acts 
in 
the 
lighter 
scale, 
when 
λ 
is 
larger; 
it 
is 
logical 
to 
suppose 
that 
it 
also 
acts 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale, 
when 
λ 
is 
smaller. 
In 
λ=0, 
it 



doesn’t 
act, 
but 
that's 
irrelevant, 
because 
λPlanck 
is 
the 
minimum 
space 
that 
can 
exist; 
so, 
λ=0 
doesn’t 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe. 



109. 
Higgs 
field 
and 
its 
relation 
with 
λp 
Besides 
that, 
the 
graph 
is 
clear 
in 
that 
there 
is 
a 
uniform 
space 
from 
the 
beginning, 
1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm= 
λ 
= 
λp 
> 
0, 
to 
a 
maximum 
value; 
and 
after 
that, 
E 
is 
always 
positive. 
The 
position 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
is 
mostly 
correct, 
there 
is 
only 
one 
difference. 
The 
Planck 
Higgs 
field 
is 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
x, 
almost 
at 
the 
origin. 
We 
can 
obtain 
a 
similar 
graph, 
using 
λ 
instead 
of 
H, 
because 
of 
the 
direct 
relation 
between 
them. 



The 
Standard 
Model 
graph 
drawn 
above 
is 
correct; 
but 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
Standard 
Model 
supposition 
that 
the 
heavier 
scale 
(half 
of 
the 
microcosmo's 
logarithmical 
space) 
is 
empty 
(with 
no 
production 
of 
particles) 
the 
graph 
would 
be 
different, 
and 
of 
course, 
incorrect. 
In 
effect, 
the 
graph 
would 
be:

Value 
of 
Α, 
constant 
in 
Higgs 
formulas 
If 
we 
suppose 
that 
approximately 
1 
cm 
(exactly 
0.687289278 
cm) 
is 
the 
maximum 
value 
of 
λ 
for 
an 
active 
Higgs 
mechanism, 
we 
could 
obtain 
the 
approximate 
value 
for 
the 
positive 
constant 
A. 
The 
position 
that 
A 
and 
M2are 
not 
too 
different 
in 
size 
is 
totally 
incorrect. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
A 
is 
a 
constant 
and 
M2 
is 
a 
variable. 
Moreover, 
they 
have 
different 
units. 
A 
is 
in 
g3cm-2 
s2, 
and 
M2 
is 
in 
g2. 
And 
so: 


ℏ3/(c5λ3)>A 


This 
former 
formula 
would 
be 
practically 
correct 
from 
λp 
to 
maximum 
λ 
(0.687289278 
cm). 
At 
that 
moment, 
the 
equation 
would 
be 
approximately 
equivalent. 
In 
consequence: 


A 
≅ 
ℏ3/(c5λ3) 
≅ 
((1.054569454 
x10-27)3)/((2.99792458 
x1010)5 
x 
(0.687289278)3) 
≅

Neutrinos 
interaction 
with 
Higgs 
field. 
Particles 
and 
gravity 
The 
graph 
shows 
us 
a 
symmetric 
figure. 
But 
we 
only 
use 
one 
side. 
The 
other 
side 
would 
show 
us 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
for 
our 
parallel 
world 
of 
antimatter. 
In 
effect, 
we 
can 
see 
that 
in 
the 
simplified 
formula: 
M2>AH2, 
M 
is 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
quanta 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
that 
is 
related 
with 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
particles, 
and 
H 
is 
the 
one 
related 
with 
the 
Higgs 
field. 
Both 
are 
represented 
in 
their 
square 
form. 
That 
means 
that 
there 
are 
two 
roots 
of 
±M 
and 
±H, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
we 
can 
have 
the 
complete 
graph 
in 
a 
symmetric 
way, 
representing 
both 
parallel 
Universes. 
According 
to 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
all 
particles 
can 
directly 
interact 
with 
the 
Higgs 
field 
except 
for 
photons, 
neutrinos, 
and 
gluons. 
For 
us, 
neutrinos 
have 
mass 
and 
in 
consequence 
they 
directly 
interact 
with 
Higgs 
fields 
and 
also 
gluons, 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale. 
Only 
photons 
don't 
ever 
interact 
with 
Higgs 
fields. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
because 
photons 
always 
have 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest 
in 
the 
microcosmos, 
in 
the 
known 
lighter 
scale, 
in 
the 
unknown 
and 
supposed 
heavier 
scale, 
in 
the 
macrocosmos, 
and 
even 
in 
both 
parallel 
Universes: 
matter 
and 
antimatter. 
A 
heavy 
graviton 
with 
interaction 
with 
the 
first 
Higgs 
Field 
existed 
only 
in 
the 
first 
chronos, 
when 
the 
gravitational 
force 
was 
exactly 
equal 
to 
the 
other 
three 
forces. 
After 
that, 
it 
is 
not 
included 
in 
the 
quantum 
wave, 
and 
in 
consequence 
it 
is 
outside 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
action. 
In 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe, 
a 
graviton 
alone 
collapses 
the 
quantum 
wave, 
and 
this 
affirmation 
reinforces 
our 
position: 
that 
gravitational 
waves 
and 
quantum 
waves 
are 
incompatible, 
and 
only 
coincide 
in 
the 
first 
chronos 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang.

Higgs 
mechanism 
symmetry. 
Superpartners 
and 
Z, 
available 
room 
The 
supersymmetry 
explanation 
of 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
derives 
in 
a 
different 
graph. 



The 
figure 
shows 
the 
square 
of 
masses 
vertically; 
and 
energy, 
horizontally. 
In 
that 
model, 
the 
Planck 
scale 
seems 
to 
correspond 
to 
a 
large 
energy. 
Our 
position 
is 
different; 
Planck 
has 
the 
maximum 
energetic 
Higgs 
field, 
but 
to 
obtain 
the 
total 
energy, 
we 
need 
to 
multiply 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
by 
the 
number 
of 
Higgs 
fields. 
Like 
we 
affirmed 
before, 
the 
minimum 
mass 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
minimum 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
was 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
It 
even 
had 
the 
hottest 
state 
and 
the 
largest 
energy 
density 
ever. 
Planck 
scale 
needs 
to 
be 
near 
the 
origin, 
when 
M2 
is 
negative. 
Besides 
that, 
it 
is 
also 
a 
wrong 
position 
to 
consider 
that 
quarks 
and 
leptons 
are 
massless 
in 
the 
heavier 



scale 
(in 
Planck 
scale 
until 
around 
the 
electroweak 
boson). 
We 
insist, 
to 
consider 
a 
particle 
of 
matter 
without 
mass 
is 
a 
wrong 
position, 
because 
it 
is 
against 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
the 
basis 
of 
quantum 
mechanics. 
Moreover, 
how 
can 
particles 
that 
have 
λ 
larger 
than 
the 
whole 
size 
of 
the 
visible 
Universe, 
in 
the 
Planck 
era, 
exist? 
Besides 
that, 
the 
essential 
characteristic 
of 
particles 
are: 
mass, 
charge 
and 
spin. 
Quarks 
and 
leptons 
without 
mass 
would 
be 
other 
particles, 
with 
new 
and 
different 
families. 
The 
Superstring 
theory 
also 
needs 
that 
the 
masses 
of 
superpartners 
to 
be 
not 
much 
larger 
than 
the 
Z 
boson 
mass, 
in 
order 
for 
its 
proposed 
whole 
approach 
to 
be 
valid. 
Like 
we 
pointed 
out 
before, 
there 
is 
not 
much 
room 
for 
the 
superpartners 
to 
appear, 
and 
this 
small 
room 
would 
be 
ugly 
and 
totally 
asymmetric. 
The 
“normal” 
particles 
have 
a 
big 
room 
and 
very 
different 
masses, 
and 
if 
the 
superpartners 
would 
appear, 
they 
would 
need 
to 
pile 
up, 
in 
a 
very 
reduced 
space. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
expand 
the 
room 
available 
for 
any 
case 
(superpartners 
or 
heavy 
partners).

Energy 
of

Ranges 
of 
Higgs 
length 
How 
did 
the 
Higgs 
field 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
managed 
to 
have 
maximum 
energy, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
the 
Universe 
had 
its 
minimum 
energy? 
The 
answer 
is 
simple. 
There 
was 
only 
one 
Higgs 
field 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang; 
and 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
not 
only 
determined 
by 
the 
amount 
of 
energy 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field, 
but 
also 
by 
the 
number 
of 
Higgs 
fields 
existing 
in 
that 
specific 
moment: 
(E=nH). 
We 
must 
also 
remember, 
Higgs 
fields 
pervade 
all 
space. 
So, 
the 
graphs 
about 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
in 
the 
Standard 
Model 
and 
the 
Supersymmetry 
explanation 
of 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
are 
wrong, 
because 
Planck 
scale 
is 
the 
minimum 
cosmic 
energy 
and 
so, 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
almost 
at 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
graph 
and 
not 
in 
a 
scale 
of 
large 
energy. 
In 
that 
way, 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
in 
the 
heaviest 
scale 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
there 
are 
no 
new 
particles 
that 
are 
heavier; 
or 
even 
worse, 
that 
the 
“same” 
particles 
have 
no 
mass. 
This 
asseveration 
is 
against 
the 
main 
principle 
of 
quantum 
mechanics: 
the 
uncertainty 
principle. 
In 
other 
words, 
Higgs 
fields 
form 
particles; 
they 
have 
done 
this 
since 
the 
Big 
Bang 
(space 
∅ 
or 
Planck 
length), 
and 
continued 
to 
do 
it 
until 
the 
maximum 
space 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
era 
(a 
little 
smaller 
than 
1 
cm, 
exactly 
0.687289278 
cm). 
0 
< 
H 
< 
1 
and 
0 
cm 
< 
λ 
< 
1 
cm 
or 
λp 
≤ 
λ 
≤ 
0.687289278 
cm 


A 
λ 
larger 
than 
0.687289278 
cm 
cannot 
make 
a 
Higgs 
field.

Values 
of 
Higgs 
fields. 
Higgs 
mechanism 
and 
its 
relation 
The 
position 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
that 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat 
is 
only 
a 
supposition 
that 
has 
no 
physical 
or 
mathematical 
explanations. 
For 
us, 
that 
position 
is 
totally 
wrong. 
Besides 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
(correct 
in 
this 
way) 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
(H) 
increase 
the 
energy 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
by 
adding 
an 
amount 
of 
energy, 
that 
we 
call 
EH, 
that 
we 
can 
add 
and 
form 
particles 
with 
mass 
in 
inverse 
relation 
with 
its 
length, 
using 
the 
formula 
ℏ/cλ=m, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
microcosmos, 
that 
acts 
according 
to 
quantum 
mechanics. 
The 
Higgs 
Mechanism 
can 
make 
new 
matter 
even 
in 
the 
macrocosmos, 
but 
λ 
cannot 
be 
larger 
than 
0.687289278 
cm. 
The 
EH 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
according 
to 
the 
equation: 
EH=M2H2+AH4; 
where 
A 
is 
a 
positive 
constant. 
M2 
is 
the 
square 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
quanta 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field. 
M2 
is 
a 
negative 
quantity. 
EH 
needs 
to 
be 
negative. 
In 
zero 
or 
positive 
EH, 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
doesn’t 
act. 



According 
to 
the 
graph, 
the 
state 
of 
lowest 
energy 
does 
not 
occur 
in 
a 
zero 
Higgs 
field, 
but 
rather 
from 
a 
value 
of 
H 
different 
from 
zero. 
When 
E 
is 
negative, 
it 
makes 
particles 
and 
that 
is 
represented 
in 
the 
shadowed 
area. 
In 
the 
graph 
we 
see 
a 
minimum 
point 
(at 
almost 
0) 
until 
a 
maximum 
point. 
According 
to 
the 
former 
formula, 
If 
H=0 
E=0, 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
is 
inactive. 
After 
the 
maximum 
point, 
E 
will 
be 
permanently 
positive 
and 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
will 
be 
inactive 
again. 
We 
can 
obtain 
several 
important 
results 
simply 
by 
manipulating 
how 
this 
relation 
behaves, 
even 
though 
sometimes, 
only 
approximately. 



115. 
Cosmological 
"constant" 
and 
Ω 
The 
value 
of 
the 
energy 
density 
of 
vacuum 
is 
related 
to 
the 
cosmological 
"constant": 


Λ=8πGϕv 
This 
is 
a 
different 
formula 
to 
the 
one 
previously 
stated: 
Λ=6/R2; 
however 
they 
are 
similar, 
they 
only 
have 
a 
different 
set 
of 
units. 
In 
the 
formula 
Λ=6/R2 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
determine 
that 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
is 
in 
fact 
a 
variable, 
since 
R 
is 
a 
variable 
that 
increases 
with 
time. 
The 
cosmological 
constant 
decreases 
with 
time. 
But 
we 
can 
also 
confirm 
the 
variability 
of 
this 
“constant” 
with 
the 
other 
formula, 
even 
with 
the 
same 
relation 
(decreasing 
its 
value 
in 
time). 
In 
effect, 
the 
energy 
density 
of 
the 
vacuum 
is 
utterly 
negligible 
compared 
with 
the 
energy 
density 
in 
the 
early 
Universe. 
In 
simple 
arithmetical 
calculations, 
we 
see 
the 
equivalence 
of 
both 
formulas: 


Λ=8πGϕv 
where 
ϕv=m/((4/3)πR3) 
and 
m 
= 
(Rc2)/G. 
And 
so: 
Λ=(8πG.3.Rc2)/(4πR3G) 
Simplifying: 
Λ=6c2/R2 
And 
so, 
we 
can 
use 
two 
formulas: 


Λ=6/R2 
[cm-2] 
or 
Λ=6/R2c2 
[s-2) 
or 
Λ=8πGϕν 
A 
cosmological 
constant 
corresponding 
to 
Ω≈1 
is 
consistent 
with 
observations, 
but 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
it 
was 
Ω≈10120. 
The 
reason 
why 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
has 
changed, 
making 
the 
extremely 
big 
effect 
at 
the 
beginning 
to 
be 
a 
negligible 
value 
today, 
was 
explained 
in 
former 
sections. 



116. 
Natural 
logarithms 
in 
time 
calculations 
The 
microcosmos 
era 
ended 
when 
light-space 
(h) 
reached 
approximately 
one 
cm 
(exactly 
0.687289278cm), 
in 
a 
very 
small 
fraction 
of 
one 
second 
(2.293 
x10-11 
s). 
Most 
physical 
phenomena 
developed 
during 
this 
time. 
This 
took 
place 
during 
an 
infinitesimal 
fraction 
of 
time, 
if 
we 
use 
the 
human 
scale. 
But 
in 
logarithmic 
time, 
the 
Microcosmos 
era 
is 
practically 
half 
of 
all 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
whole 
cycle 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
from 
the 
Big 
Bang 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
what 
we 
call 
Big 
Crush; 
and 
what 
most 
scientists 
call 
Big 
Crunch). 
We 
insist: 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
logarithmical, 
not 
arithmetical. 


In 
other 
words, 
microcosmos 
time 
and 
macrocosmos 
time 
are 
logarithmically 
equivalent.

Both

are

The 
small 
difference 
between 
them 
is 
only 
apparent 
because 
of 
arithmetical 
approximations. 


Some 
scientists 
discuss 
about 
how 
old 
is 
the 
Universe 
using 
arithmetical 
time. 
They 
don't 
take 
into 
account 
that, 
for 
the 
universe, 
the 
microcosmos 
era 
(which 
for 
us 
occurred 
in 
less 
than 
a 
second) 
is 
half 
of 
its 
total 
life. 


Besides 
that, 
if 
cosmic 
space 
is 
always 
accelerating, 
it 
is 
permanently 
making 



matter; 
according 
to 
the 
approximate 
relation: 
(Rc2)/G≅M. 
Where 
c2 
and 
G 
are 
constants 
(and 
always 
have 
been 
and 
will 
be) 
in 
our 
Universe; 
by 
increasing 
R, 
M 
will 
increase 
in 
a 
directly 
proportional 
way 
(the 
particles 
using 
Higgs 
mechanism 
are 
ruled 
by 
an 
inverse 
relation 
according 
to 
the 
uncertainty 
principle: 
ℏ/cλ=m). 



117. 
Variability 
of 
Hubble 
constant 
Like 
we 
pointed 
out 
before, 
there 
a 
lot 
of 
questions 
that 
need 
answers, 
more 
than 
any 
reasonable 
doubt, 
before 
we 
can 
affirm 
how 
old 
is 
the 
Universe 
in 
a 
sharp 
quantity? 
The 
main 
questions 
are: 


a) 
First 
of 
all, 
is 
the 
Hubble 
constant? 
With 
different 
measurements, 
no 
one 
has 
an 
exact 
quantity 
Ex. 
Tully 
Fisher 
relation: 
H0=71±3±7 
km 
s-1 
Mpc-1 
with 
the 
first 
quoted 
statistical 
uncertainty 
and 
the 
second 
systematic. 
Faber 
– 
Jackson 
method: 


H0=78±5 
(stat)±9(syst) 
km 
s-1Mpc-1 


Harvard 
group 


H0=73±4(stat)±5(syst) 
km 
s-1Mpc-1 


The 
HST 
key 
H0 
group: 


H0=71±6 
km 
s-1Mpc-1 
etc. 


b) 
Λ; 
what 
is 
its 
value 
and 
is 
it 
constant 
or 
is 
it 
variable? 
It 
has 
a 
direct 
relation 
with 
vacuum 
energy, 
dark 
energy, 
and 
the 
quintessence. 
Our 
position 
is 
that 
Λ 
(and 
its 
related 
effects) 
is 
not 
constant; 
its 
value 
right 
now 
is 
small 
because 
the 
Universe 
is 
old 
(its 
radius 
is 
larger). 
Without 
a 
complete 
security 
about 
Λ, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
calculate 
the 
exact 
age 
of 
Universe. 
c) 
The 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe, 
it’s 
a 
kind 
of 
inflation. 
Is 
it 
permanently 
accelerating 
or 
does 
it 
do 
it 
at 
different 
stages: 
deceleration, 
constant, 
repulsion, 
etc.? 
d) 
What 
is 
the 
relation 
among 
matter, 
dark 
matter, 
dark 
energy 
and 
others? 
Without 
the 
security 
of 
experimental 
results 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
affirm 
how 
old 
is 
the 
Universe 
in 
a 
sharp 
quantity. 
The 
most 
plausible 
thing 
to 
do 
is 
to 
estimate 
a 
range. 
The 
formula 
indicated 
in 
Steven 
Weinberg's 
book, 
“Cosmology”, 
is 
really 
useful. 


t0=13.4 
((70/km/Mpc)/H0) 
Gyr 
If 
H0 
is 
68.6 
km/ 
s/ 
Mpc. 
The 
formula 
would 
be: 



t0 
13.4 
(1.020408163)Gyr 
And 
its 
range 
would 
be: 


12.38 
~ 
14.73 
Gyr 
The 
maximum 
value 
is 
more 
plausible, 
because 
of 
the 
age 
of 
some 
clusters 
and 
stars 
that 
are 
bordering 
this 
age. 
It 
is 
impossible 
for 
any 
kind 
of 
matter 
to 
be 
older 
than 
the 
known 
Universe. 
However, 
like 
we 
explained 
before, 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
obtain 
the 
exact 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ 
in 
cm-2 
right 
now 
and 
to 
then 
use 
it 
in 
the 
simple 
formula 


R=±√(6/Λ) 


t0=±1/c 
√(6/Λ) 
or 


t0=±√(6/Λc2) 
We 
obtained 
two 
roots: 
+ 
root 
is 
the 
time 
of 
our 
Universe; 
(-) 
is 
the 
time 
of 
our 
parallel 
Universe; 
both 
exactly 
equals, 
but 
opposite. 



118. 
Dark 
matter 
Black 
holes, 
and 
stars 
called 
brown 
dwarfs, 
are 
both 
types 
of 
dark 
matter. 
Neutrinos 
are 
also 
a 
type 
of 
dark 
matter. 
They 
are 
very 
abundant, 
have 
a 
minimal 
mass 
and 
they 
have 
reactions 
only 
through 
weak 
interaction. 
Dark 
matter 
is 
electrically 
neutral. 
If 
they 
weren't 
neutral, 
they 
would 
interact 
with 
light. 
In 
another 
way, 
they 
do 
not 
interact 
electromagnetically. 
They 
don’t 
have 
reactions 
with 
the 
strong 
force, 
do 
not 
participate 
in 
any 
process 
of 
nuclear 
fusion, 
and 
do 
not 
give 
off 
light. 
The 
three 
families 
of 
neutrinos 
can 
be 
considered 
hot 
dark 
matter, 
and 
because 
of 
their 
small 
mass, 
they 
almost 
travel 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
The 
only 
completely 
stable 
of 
the 
three 
neutrinos, 
in 
our 
actual 
condition, 
is 
the 
electron 
neutrino; 
it 
has 
the 
maximum 
λ 
but 
the 
lightest 
mass. 
Even 
though 
they 
exist 
in 
abundance, 
their 
mass 
is 
infinitesimal 
(around 
1.1256 
x10-14) 
GeV 
each) 
and 
so, 
they 
do 
not 
contribute 
much 
to 
the 
total 
mass 
of 
dark 
matter. 
A 
hypothetical 
new 
dark 
matter 
particle 
acquires 
a 
practical 
need 
to 
exist. 
The 
Weakly 
Interacting 
Massive 
Particle 
(WIMP), 
or 
something 
different 
needs 
to 
exist 
in 
order 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
large 
% 
of 
dark 
matter 
in 
our 
Universe 
today. 
Supersting 
theory, 
with 
its 
sneutrinos 
1, 
2, 
and 
3, 
especially 
sneutrino1, 
as 
LSP, 
(the 
lightest 
superpartner 
and 
in 
consequence, 
stable) 
is 
basically 
the 
way 
most 
experiments 
designed 
to 
detect 
WIMPs 
use. 
But 
what 
happens 
if 
superpartners 
don’t 
exist? 
Their 
equivalent, 
heavy-partners, 
would 
be 
a 
convenient 
area 
of 
research. 
This 
book 
considers 
the 
existence 
of 
heavy-partners, 
in 
which 
the 
lightest 
heavy 
partner 
would 
be 
a 
new 
kind 
of 
neutrino 
– 
that 
we 
named 
neutronio, 
with 
a 
mass 
of 
132 
GeV, 
with 
almost 
no 
movement; 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
with 
a 
tendency 
to 
form 
groups 
of 
them 
(as 
halos) 
around 
galaxies. 
Only 
one 
particle 
interacts 
with 
the 
weak 
force; 
but 
in 
big 
groups, 
forming 
a 
compact 
cloud, 
the 
gravitational 
effect 
could 
become 
important. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
scientists 
that 
follow 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
which 
is 
totally 
successful 
in 
the 
lightest 
scale, 
need 
to 
open 
their 
mind, 
and 
to 
wait 
for 
new 
heavy 
particles 
in 
the 
other 
half 
of 
the 
logarithmic 
scale 
(heavier 
scale) 
and 
to 
forget 
the 
assumed 
position 
that 
Higgs 
fields 
are 
destroyed 
by 
heat. 
The 



connection 
of 
these 
heavy 
neutrinos 
with 
dark 
matter 
is 
similar 
as 
in 
Supersymmetry 
theory, 
because 
the 
lightest 
heavy-partner 
particle 
couldn’t 
decay 
into 
normal 
matter, 
similar 
like 
the 
lightest 
superpartner 
(or 
LSP). 
However, 
a 
possible 
decay 
would 
be: 
ZZ, 
and/or 
energetic 
photons. 
It 
is 
also 
electrically 
neutral 
and 
can 
only 
interact 
with 
the 
weak 
force. 
This 
would 
be 
an 
ideal 
particle 
to 
form 
the 
bulk 
of 
dark 
matter.

Oscillating 
Universes, 
Quantum 
multiverse, 
Gravitational 
Universe 
The 
traditional 
Big 
Bang 
– 
Big 
Crunch 
cycles 
of 
Universes 
is 
called 
the 
oscillating 
Universe. 
This 
is 
not 
a 
popular 
idea 
among 
physicists. 
There 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
technical 
difficulties 
in 
order 
to 
name 
it 
as 
a 
successful 
theory, 
such 
as: 


a) 
According 
to 
the 
second 
law 
of 
thermodynamic, 
the 
entropy 
of 
the 
Universe 
will 
increase 
with 
time, 
regardless 
if 
the 
Universe 
is 
expanding 
or 
contracting. 
And 
in 
any 
new 
Big 
Bang, 
entropy 
is 
almost 
zero. 
Where 
did 
the 
entropy 
go? 
b) 
The 
entropy's 
growth 
causes 
the 
length 
of 
each 
cycle 
in 
a 
new 
Big 
Bang 
Universe 
to 
be 
larger 
than 
the 
one 
before 
it. 
c) 
The 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
not 
slowing 
down, 
but 
rather, 
the 
Universe 
is 
accelerating. 
d) 
In 
each 
new 
cycle, 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
new 
conditions 
and 
values 
to 
be 
developed. 
All 
of 
the 
four 
main 
problems 
have 
a 
solution 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
new 
dimensions, 
one 
by 
one, 
like 
we 
explained 
in 
former 
sections. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
position 
that 
a 
Multiverse, 
with 
10500 
or 
even 
more 
Universes, 
exists; 
which 
is 
based 
in 
quantum 
mechanics 
and 
the 
incoherent 
quantum 
waves 
(which 
only 
act 
in 
the 
Microcosmos) 
is 
totally 
inexact. 
Linde 
and 
Vanchurin 
have 
calculated 
that 
the 
number 
of 
Universes 
in 
the 
multiverse 
is 
at 
least 
1010^10000000, 
which 
is 
an 
incredibly 
large 
quantity, 
but 
at 
least 
it’s 
better 
than 
considering 
infinite 
universes. 
However, 
a 
different 
parallel 
Universe 
does 
exist, 
where 
the 
gravitational 
waves, 
coherent 
and 
ordered, 
act. 
Besides 
that, 
a 
parallel 
Universe, 
totally 
symmetric 
with 
ours, 
exists 
in 
our 
Macrocosmos 
era 
and 
in 
the 
Microcosmos 
era. 
The 
link 
between 
our 
Universe 
and 
our 
parallel 
and 
symmetric 
Universe, 
is 
a 
wormhole 
of 
R=1.615979906 
x10-33; 
this 
is, 
Planck 
length, 
impossible 
to 
form 
with 
current 
human 
technology. 
But 
this 
wormhole 
exists 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes. 
Each 
black 
hole 
in 
our 
Universe 
has 
a 
center, 
with 
Planck 
length 
size, 
that 
communicates 
with 
another 
black 
hole 
in 
the 
parallel 
Universe; 
each 
black 
hole 
in 
a 
Universe 
acts 
like 
a 
corresponding 
white 
hole 



in 
the 
other 
Universe, 
with 
the 
same 
length, 
λp. 
So, 
the 
distance 
between 
both 
parallel 
Universes 
is 
2λp. 
Besides 
that, 
Universes 
with 
bigger 
number 
of 
dimensions 
also 
exist; 
but 
they 
have 
wormholes 
smaller 
than 
Plank 
length, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
they 
are 
impossible 
to 
access 
materially 
from 
our 
Universe. 
Mathematically 
and 
physically, 
the 
relation 
among 
the 
multidimensional 
Universe 
is 
the 
force 
of 
gravity. 
For 
that 
reason, 
in 
the 
first 
chronos 
of 
any 
Big 
Bang, 
gravity 
had 
the 
same 
strength 
as 
the 
other 
forces. 
We 
can 
do 
a 
hypothetical 
description 
of 
Universes 
with 
different 
dimensions 
from 
ours, 
but 
that 
would 
be 
farther 
away 
from 
any 
experimental 
proof. 
We 
explain 
this 
only 
with 
a 
general 
description, 
but 
for 
our 
Universe, 
we 
detail 
it 
and 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
than 
live 
in 
it. 


An 
enormous 
number 
of 
black 
holes 
exist; 
this 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
each 
black 
hole 
has 
a 
different 
parallel 
Universe. 
All 
black 
holes 
(1016~1018 
or 
more) 
in 
our 
Universe, 
communicate 
with 
different 
sections 
of 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
(the 
same 
and 
only 
one) 
in 
a 
CPT 
connection. 



120. 
Age 
of 
the 
Universe 
Even 
today, 
most 
astronomers 
consider 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
13.7 
billion 
of 
years 
old 
because 
of 
a 
meticulous 
interpretation 
of 
all 
the 
experimental 
data. 
Nobody 
can 
fully 
accept 
the 
100% 
accuracy 
of 
these 
experimental 
measures. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
laws 
of 
physics 
are 
not 
consistent 
in 
some 
cases; 
in 
other 
cases 
there 
are 
many 
different 
opinions 
on 
these 
measures; 
and 
the 
physical 
theory 
is 
still 
incomplete. 
For 
example, 
for 
some, 
the 
value 
of 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
is 
inexistent 
(value=0); 
while 
others 
consider 
that 
its 
value 
is 
a 
very 
small 
one. 
Its 
experimental 
value 
is 
more 
recognized; 
it 
is 
bounded 
empirically 
by 
Λ 
< 
3 
x10-56 
cm-2. 
Moreover, 
comparing 
this 
experimental 
value 
with 
theoretical 
results 
in 
quantum 
calculations 
gives 
us 
a 
difference 
of 
approximately 
10120; 
the 
biggest 
difference 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science. 
In 
a 
former 
section 
of 
this 
book 
we 
explained 
this 
difference 
and 
we 
proposed 
a 
simple 
formula: 
Λ=6/R2. 
Because 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
always 
stretching, 
R 
increases 
with 
time 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
is 
permanently 
variable 
and 
its 
value 
decreases 
with 
time. 
We 
know 
that 
in 
physics 
Λ 
describes 
a 
force 
that 
causes 
matters 
to 
fly 
apart 
from 
one 
another; 
with 
an 
acceleration 
proportional 
to 
their 
separation, 
in 
a 
specific 
time; 
independent 
of 
their 
masses 
and 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
energy 
density 
of 
vacuum, 
and 
of 
course, 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe. 
If 
we 
consider 
the 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ 
(Λ 
< 
3 
x10-56 
cm2), 
as 
we 
pointed 
out 
in 
a 
former 
section, 
the 
Universe 
would 
have 
15.0 
billions 
of 
years. 
Notwithstanding, 
this 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ 
could 
have 
a 
margin 
of 
error 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
with 
the 
data 
utilized 
by 
astronomers, 
we 
prefer 
to 
put 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
between 
13.5 
~ 
15 
Gyr, 
which 
is 
a 
range 
instead 
of 
a 
sharp 
quantity. 
Astronomers 
can 
use 
13.7 
Gyr. 
I 
prefer 
to 
continue 
using 
15 
Gyr. 
Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
this 
is 
a 
big 
quantity 
in 
human 
terms, 
but 
in 
Universal 
time 
(basically 
in 
logarithmical 
terms) 
it 
is 
only 
a 
small 
difference. 
Using 
13.7 
billions 
of 
years, 
Λ 
needs 
to 
be 
larger. 
In 
effect: 


Λ 
= 
6/R2 



13.7 
Billions 
of 
years 
= 
1.296112268 
x1028 
cm 
Λ=6/((1.296112268 
x1028)2)=3.571626263 
x10-56 
cm-2 
Another 
way 
to 
represent 
Λ=8πGϕv 
in 
s-2, 
where 
ϕv 
(is 
the 
average 
vacuum 
density 
of 
the 
Universe, 
in 
a 
determined 
time. 
Or 
Λ=8πGϕv/c2 
in 
cm-2

Astronomical 
and 
physical 
concepts 
that 
need 
to 
be 
elucidated 
There 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
physics 
and 
astronomical 
concepts 
that 
need 
to 
be 
elucidated 
before 
we 
can 
give 
an 
exact 
number 
to 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
Such 
as: 


• 
The 
exact 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ, 
as 
of 
right 
now. 
• 
If 
the 
expansion 
rate 
of 
the 
Universe 
has 
been 
constant 
over 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Universe 
from 
the 
beginning 
(or 
at 
least 
from 
380,000 
years 
ago, 
at 
CMB, 
Cosmic 
Microwave 
Background), 
why 
were 
photons 
released? 
• 
The 
exact 
value 
of 
the 
Hubble 
constant, 
its 
change 
with 
time 
and 
the 
side 
effect 
of 
the 
acceleration 
in 
all 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Universe. 
• 
What 
is 
dark 
energy? 
And 
what 
percentage 
of 
the 
total 
dark 
matter 
is: 
hot, 
cold, 
and 
exotic. 
• 
The 
different 
varieties 
of 
black 
holes 
and 
their 
participation 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universes. 
• 
If 
axions 
exist. 
• 
If 
superpartners 
exist. 
• 
If 
WIMPs 
exist, 
are 
they 
a 
new 
class 
of 
heavier 
neutrinos? 
• 
What 
kind 
of 
inflation 
was 
there 
in 
the 
primitive 
Universe? 
• 
The 
type 
of 
expansion: 
was 
it 
always 
accelerating; 
or 
did 
it 
changed 
with 
time: 
attraction 
dominates, 
loitering 
phases; 
and 
repulsion 
dominates. 
• 
What 
happened 
with 
the 
kinetic 
energy? 
• 
Is 
the 
Universe 
flat 
or 
is 
it 
only 
almost 
flat, 
at 
this 
moment? 
• 
Do 
neutrinos 
have 
mass 
or 
not? 
If 
they 
do, 
how 
much? 
• 
Forms 
to 
manipulate 
the 
dates 
obtained 
from 
the 
patterns 
in 
the 
map 
of 
the 
CMB; 
review 
of 
the 
supposed 
distance 
between 
space 
(today) 
from 
the 
moment 
the 
CMB 
was 
released. 
• 
Review 
of 
all 
the 
quantities 
utilized 
to 
calculate 
the 
age 
of 
Universe 
from 
CMB. 
Is 
Ω=1 
or 
is 
it 
only 
≅1; 
dark 
energy; 
dark 
matter; 
normal 
matter, 
etc. 
• 
The 
Hubble 
constant 
(variable 
that 
changes 
with 
time 
and 
with 
any 
new 
calculations 
of 
the 
same 
or 
new 
teams). 
The 
length 
of 
space 
when 
the 
CMB 
photons 
were 
released 
until 
now, 
which 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
44 
billion 
light 

years. 


• 
Etc. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
continue 
refining 
the 
experimental 
dates 
and 
the 
answers 
derived 
from 
the 
WMAP 
results. 
But, 
we 
need 
to 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
choose 
the 
correct 
answers 
over 
the 
suppositions, 
in 
theoretical 
physics. 
The 
easiest 
way 
to 
obtain 
the 
exact 
age 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
by 
obtaining 
the 
exact 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ. 



122. 
FTL 
cosmic 
space. 
Einstein 
barrier 
The 
Einstein 
maximum 
limit 
of 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum 
(2.99792458 
x1010 
cm/s) 
is 
a 
limit 
only 
for 
matter. 
Cosmic 
space 
is 
definitely 
further 
away 
of 
that 
limit, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
cosmic 
space 
is 
always 
expanding 
faster 
than 
light. 
So, 
44 
billion 
light-years, 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
cosmic 
space, 
is 
physically 
and 
mathematically 
possible; 
but 
it 
seems 
too 
high 
and 
we 
need 
to 
review 
it. 
Our 
horizon 
of 
success 
(h), 
obtained 
by 
multiplying 
c.t 
is 
considerably 
smaller, 
and 
this 
is 
the 
distance 
the 
photons 
have 
reached 
(distance: 
13.5~ 


15.0 
billion 
light-years). 
Our 
observable 
Universe 
uses 
the 
light-radius 
h=ct, 
and 
additional 
cosmic 
space 
is 
outside 
of 
our 
astrophysical 
observation. 
We 
need 
to 
use 
Ockham’s 
razor. 
But 
in 
a 
theoretical 
sense, 
we 
know 
that 
cosmic 
space 
will 
always 
expand 
faster 
than 
light, 
so, 
it 
will 
arrive 
to 
the 
maximum 
limit 
of 
the 
universe 
“before” 
it. 
But, 
like 
we 
explained 
in 
former 
sections, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
and 
close 
to 
it, 
(minimum 
and 
maximum 
sizes), 
time 
is 
converted 
into 
space. 
So, 
R 
and 
h 
end 
together, 
depending 
on 
the 
space 
difference 
between 
them 
and 
when 
time 
is 
converted 
into 
space. 
Astronomers, 
using 
efficient 
analysis 
of 
the 
CMB 
maps, 
reveal 
that 
the 
age 
of 
Universe 
is 
close 
to 
13.7 
billion 
years. 
This, 
at 
least, 
is 
an 
approximate 
value. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
we 
consider 
that 
the 
44 
billion 
years 
for 
cosmic 
expansion 
is 
too 
high 
in 
the 
same 
period. 
It 
is 
impossible 
for 
matter, 
including 
photons 
to 
travel 
faster 
than 
light, 
even 
if 
space 
was 
stretched 
a 
longer 
length. 
If 
we 
consider 
the 
relation 
of 
Kinetic 
Energy 
Ec=(1/2)mv2 
to 
be 
equal 
to 
mc2, 
we 
obtain 
(1/2)mv2=mc2 
and 
so, 
v=√2 
c 
We 
obtained 
in 
a 
mathematical 
relation, 
even 
if 
it’s 
too 
approximate, 
an 
average 
relation 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
cosmic 
space, 
equivalent 
to 
√2 
c 
or 
1.414213562c. 
If 
13.5~15 
Gyr 
is 
the 
light 
space 
from 
CMB 
to 
now; 
the 
cosmic 
space 
in 
the 
same 
period 
could 
be 
approximately 
22 
Gyr, 
which 
is 
half 
of 
the 
44 
Gyr 
obtained 
with 
the 
actual 
calculations 
when 
the 
sound 
waves 
(acoustic 
oscillations) 
are 
encoded 
in 
the 
WMAP 
map. 
The 
trigonometric 
parallax 
to 
measure 
distances 
would 
be 
different 
for 

macrocospical 
objects, 
instead 
of 
the 
radiation 
or 
microcospic 
waves. 



Moreover, 
we 
know 
that 
the 
angular 
size 
of 
the 
fundamental 
mode 
of 
vibration 
in 
the 
early 
Universe 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
parallax 
angle. 
But 
any 
calculations, 
farther 
to 
the 
horizon, 
could 
be 
wrong. 
The 
quantity 
that 
is 
supposed 
for 
cosmic 
radius, 
about 
44 
billions 
light–years, 
needs 
to 
be 
rechecked. 
Remember, 
luminosity 
distance 
is 
different 
between 
matter 
and 
empty 
Universes. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
difference 
is 
not 
between 
matter 
and 
radiation. 
After 
h, 
there 
is 
only 
an 
empty 
vacuum, 
with 
no 
matter 
and 
no 
radiation. 



123. 
Dimensions 
of 
the 
string 
According 
to 
the 
String 
theory, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe, 
all 
nine 
spatial 
dimensions 
(ten 
are 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
string: 
nine 
spatial 
+ 
one 
time) 
were 
in 
completely 
equal 
footing. 
They 
were 
completely 
symmetric, 
all 
curled 
up 
into 
a 
multidimensional 
Planck-sized 
nugget. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
only 
predicted 
supposition; 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
them, 
such 
as: 


• 
10 
are 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
string. 
• 
For 
some 
reason, 
10 
dimensions 
formed 
an 
unstable 
complex. 
• 
For 
that 
reason, 
there 
was 
a 
breakdown 
in 
two 
smaller 
complexes: 
six 
and 
four. 
• 
For 
another 
reason, 
six 
spatial 
dimensions 
retained 
their 
initial 
Planck 
length, 
and 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
one 
time 
were 
singled 
out 
for 
expansion, 
forming 
our 
actual 
Universe. 
• 
Only 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
were 
expandable, 
and 
because 
the 
strings 
that 
wrapped 
these 
dimensions 
were 
highly 
likely 
to 
collide, 
annihilations 
were 
made 
that 
lessened 
the 
constriction, 
allowing 
the 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
to 
continue 
expanding. 
We 
have 
a 
different 
position. 


• 
Time 
was 
an 
expanded 
dimension. 
What 
happened 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the 
six 
curled 
up 
dimensions? 
• 
Eight 
are 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
first 
dimensional 
nugget 
(or 
dimensional 
modulus). 
Seven 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
one 
time 
dimension. 
• 
This 
modulus 
is 
completely 
stable. 
• 
There 
is 
no 
breakdown 
of 
the 
modulus 
(complex 
or 
nugget). 
• 
Each 
dimension 
(including 
time) 
has 
a 
different 
footing; 
and 
in 
arithmetical 
comparison, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
draw 
all 
of 
them 
together, 
due 
to 
the 
astronomical 
difference 
in 
space. 
We 
need 
to 
use 
a 
logarithmical 
scale 
in 
order 
to 
draw 
them 
in 
a 
visible 
modulus. 
• 
The 
spatial 
dimensions 
began 
to 
evolve 
in 
order 
(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7), 
developing 
a 
class 
of 
entities 
according 
to 
its 
own 
world. 
The 
only 
reason 
why 
a 
three 
spatial 
Universe 
is 
developing 
now 
is 
because 
it's 
the 
time 
to 
do 
it. 
The 
zero, 
first, 
and 
second 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universes 
were 

developed 
before 
(in 
that 
order). 
The 
4th 
spatial 
dimension 
will 
begin 
to 
develop 
afterwards, 
then 
the 
5th, 
and 
so 
on. 


• 
Their 
formulas, 
considering 
the 
minimum 
size 
(Planck) 
and 
the 
maximum 
size, 
are 
described 
in 
a 
former 
section. 
• 
Even 
though 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
one 
time 
are 
now 
developing; 
the 
minimum 
limit, 
forming 
the 
multidimensional 
nugget 
or 
dimensional 
modulus, 
doesn’t 
go 
away. 
Like 
in 
an 
electronic 
orbital, 
when 
the 
electron 
goes 
away, 
the 
orbital 
doesn't 
disappear, 
it 
will 
always 
be 
there, 
either 
real 
or 
virtual. 
If 
eight 
(or 
ten) 
are 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
of 
the 
dimensional 
nugget 
(including 
time), 
they 
will 
always 
be 
the 
same, 
with 
some 
dimensions 
expanding 
or 
not. 
Space 
can 
stretch 
until 
its 
maximum 
limit, 
but 
its 
minimum 
limit 
will 
always 
be 
there, 
because 
it 
is 
a 
limit, 
abstract 
space. 
• 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
there 
is 
a 
multidimensional 
nugget 
with 
maximum 
limits, 
forming 
a 
virtual 
modulus 
too.

String 
theory 
and 
size 
0 
The 
String 
theory 
is 
completely 
successful 
in 
avoiding 
size 
zero, 
and 
in 
consequence 
infinite 
density. 
By 
fixing 
a 
minimum 
size 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
our 
Universe: 
Planck 
length, 
1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm, 
the 
infinities 
in 
the 
case 
of 
density 
and 
temperature 
are 
avoided; 
colossal 
results 
are 
obtained, 
but 
they 
are 
finite. 
If 
we 
use 
this 
Planck 
length 
in 
the 
center 
of 
a 
black 
hole, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
gateway 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe. 
Instead 
of 
having 
the 
end 
of 
time 
and 
collapse 
of 
our 
Universe, 
we 
have 
an 
initial 
time 
of 
another 
Universe. 
This 
is, 
when 
time 
in 
our 
Universe 
comes 
to 
an 
end, 
time 
in 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
just 
begins. 
We 
need 
a 
CPT 
connection. 
In 
that 
way, 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
would 
be: 
Antimatter-Inverse 
spin 
and 
inverse 
time. 
The 
symmetry 
conditions 
affirm 
that 
constants 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c 
are 
equal 
in 
both 
Universes. 
M 
and 
R 
are 
also 
equal 
but 
have 
an 
inverse 
sign. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
need 
to 
reaffirm 
some 
rules. 


• 
Planck 
length 
in 
our 
Universe 
(approx. 
1.616 
x10-33 
cm) 
is 
exactly 
equal 
in 
each 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
in 
our 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
• 
The 
minimum 
Planck 
in 
a 
Universe, 
with 
different 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
is 
equal 
for 
all 
the 
dimensions 
in 
that 
Universe, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
but 
they 
are 
completely 
different 
among 
Universes 
with 
a 
different 
number 
of 
dimensions. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
Planck 
length 
of 
approx. 
1.616x 
10-33 
cm 
is 
only 
valid 
for 
a 
Universe 
with 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
like 
ours. 
• 
There 
are 
no 
sub-Planck 
measures 
in 
our 
Universe. 
Planck 
is 
the 
minimum 
length. 
Sub–Planck 
distances 
are 
outside 
of 
our 
Universe 
and 
thus 
are 
impossible 
to 
detect. 
Similar 
conditions 
exist 
in 
other 
Universes 
with 
different 
dimensions. 
They 
have 
a 
minimum 
length, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
diminish 
this 
minimum. 

126. 
Dark 
energy 
Scientists 
consider 
that 
our 
Universe 
recently 
entered 
into 
another 
accelerated 
phase 
(this 
acceleration 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
inflationary 
expansion 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
just 
as 
the 
Universe 
began). 
Accelerated 
expansions 
of 
the 
Universe, 
even 
if 
recent 
experiments 
confirm 
them, 
seem 
to 
be 
in 
conflict 
with 
the 
attractive 
nature 
of 
gravity. 
But, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
also 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
dark 
energy 
and 
the 
permanent 
action 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant”. 
Perhaps 
this 
energy 
is 
not 
a 
new 
form 
of 
energy; 
it 
could 
be 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
gravity 
acting 
at 
large 
distances. 
We 
need 
to 
consider 
that 
a 
force 
that 
is 
only 
acting 
attractively 
is 
against 
the 
thermodynamic 
principles. 
We 
know 
that: 
All 
action 
has 
a 
reaction, 
of 
the 
same 
value 
but 
in 
an 
opposite 
way. 
Attraction 
needs 
a 
counterpart 
acting 
with 
repulsion. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
details 
of 
the 
heavenly 
intensity 
distribution 
of 
microwaves 
can 
only 
be 
explained 
if 
there 
is 
a 
special 
contribution 
from 
the 
dark 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe. 
We 
cannot 
affirm 
that 
new 
acceleration 
is 
a 
product 
of 
recent 
times. 
The 
history 
of 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
shows 
a 
permanent 
acceleration. 
Like 
we 
recognize 
the 
permanent 
attraction 
force 
of 
gravity 
in 
relatively 
short 
distances; 
we 
need 
to 
accept 
the 
permanent 
repulsion 
force 
of 
dark 
energy 
or 
“antigravity” 
in 
large 
distances. 
In 
that 
way, 
gravity 
and 
its 
counterpart, 
would 
act 
inversely 
as 
the 
strong 
force. 
If 
we 
accepted 
this 
way 
of 
action 
for 
the 
nuclear 
force, 
why 
can't 
we 
think 
in 
a 
similar 
way 
for 
gravity? 
In 
effect, 
in 
an 
atomic 
nuclei, 
the 
strong 
force 
changes 
its 
way 
depending 
on 
the 
distance: 
in 
small 
distances 
it 
is 
repulsive; 
at 
the 
border 
of 
the 
nuclei 
it 
is 
completely 
attractive; 
out 
of 
the 
border 
of 
the 
atomic 
nuclei 
its 
action 
is 
zero. 
Considering 
the 
atomic 
nuclei 
to 
be 
like 
the 
Universe, 
gravity 
could 
act 
in 
an 
inverse 
form: 
completely 
attractive 
in 
small 
distances; 
repulsive 
at 
distances 
around 
the 
border 
of 
the 
Universe; 
and 
zero, 
out 
of 
the 
border 
of 
the 
Universe. 
We 
talk 
more 
about 
this 
in 
the 
next 
sections. 
Permanent 
expansion 
(in 
accelerated 
action) 
is 
a 
natural 
consequence 
of 
the 
normal 
behavior 
of 
gravitation. 
The 
gravitational 
force 
is 
not 
purely 
attractive 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
also 
has 
a 
repulsive 
action. 
Physicists 
need 
to 
at 
least 
consider 
this. 



127. 
Primordial 
black 
holes 
According 
to 
Stephen 
Hawking, 
there 
were 
a 
big 
number 
of 
primordial 
black 
holes 
existing 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era. 
Most 
have 
evaporated 
before 
the 
actual 
era, 
but 
some 
of 
them 
must 
continue 
to 
exist 
until 
now. 
One 
particle 
alone 
can 
never 
transform 
itself 
into 
a 
black 
hole, 
even 
if 
it 
had 
a 
corresponding 
Schwarzschild 
radius 
(also 
known 
as 
a 
gravitational 
radius). 
Like 
we 
explained 
in 
former 
sections, 
particles 
are 
associated 
only 
with 
a 
real 
quantum 
wave, 
even 
if 
they 
have 
a 
virtual 
gravitational 
wave, 
smaller 
than 
the 
Planck 
length, 
and 
in 
consequence 
outside 
of 
our 
Universe. 
But 
even 
if 
any 
particle 
has 
its 
own 
Schwarzschild 
radius 
(from 
a 
theoretical 
point 
of 
view); 
then, 
if 
we 
could 
squeeze 
the 
appropriate 
mass 
within 
the 
corresponding 
radius, 
we 
could 
create 
a 
black 
hole, 
according 
to 
the 
relation 
Rc2/2G=M. 
However, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
form 
a 
black 
hole, 
because 
the 
gravitational 
radius 
needs 
to 
be 
≥ 
λp. 
Not 
one 
particle 
(known 
or 
unknown), 
including 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
heavier 
mass 
particles, 
can 
obtain 
a 
gravitational 
radius 
that 
is 
equal 
or 
bigger 
to 
Planck 
length. 
For 
example, 
a 
known 
particle, 
like 
the 
proton, 
has 
its 
own 
Schwarzschild 
radius, 
albeit 
only 


2.5 
x10-52 
cm. 
This 
value 
is 
outside 
of 
the 
minimum 
limit 
necessary. 

128. 
Gravity, 
gravitational 
waves, 
and 
multidimensional 
Universe 
To 
research 
about 
the 
multidimensional 
Universe 
or 
to 
approach 
it 
(not 
to 
reach 
it 
physically), 
we 
need 
to 
use 
gravity. 
In 
physical 
experiments, 
we 
normally 
use 
electromagnetic 
phenomena. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
use 
gravitation. 
Gravitational 
waves 
are 
predicted 
by 
general 
relativity, 
but 
this 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
detected. 
Part 
of 
the 
difficulty 
is 
in 
their 
weakness 
and 
another 
part 
is 
in 
its 
spin 
2. 
Most 
gravitational 
waves 
are 
cancelled 
by 
another 
in 
the 
opposite 
side. 
Small 
imperfections 
left 
the 
gravitational 
waves 
possible 
for 
detection, 
especially 
in 
strong 
gravitational 
fields. 



Different 
quantum 
waves 
with 
spin 
1. 




A 
gravitational 
wave 
is 
practically 
an 
almost 
canceled 
wave, 
and 
the 
result 
is 
a 
straight 
line 
with 
small 
imperfections. 
The 
quantum 
wave 
with 
spin 
1 
is 
not 
cancelled, 
although 
it 
accepts 
interferences, 
and 
maintains 
its 
duality: 
wave 
and 
particle. 
This 
difference 
points 
out 
the 
incoherent 
character 
of 
the 
quantum 
wave; 
it 
can 
either 
be 
a 
particle 
or 
a 
wave. 
The 
gravitational 
wave 
is 
coherent; 
it 
practically 
acts 
like 
a 
reality, 
as 
a 
collapsing 
quantum 
wave. 
The 
colliders, 
in 
their 
experiments, 
utilize 
the 
strong, 
weak 
and 
the 
electromagnetic 
waves; 
the 
gravitational 
force, 
too 
weak 
in 
normal 
events, 
is 
generally 
ignored. 
If 
we 
could 
experiment 
with 
sensitive 
gravitational 
effects, 
a 
lot 
of 
new 
results 
could 
be 
obtained. 
For 
example: 
by 
increasing 
the 
gravity, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
increase 
the 
size 
of 
a 
“curled 
up” 
dimension. 
We 
know 
that 
the 
order 
of 
Planck 
length 
is 
10-33 
cm 
in 
our 
three-dimensional 
world; 
in 
a 
two 
dimensional 
world 
it 
is 
10-22 
cm.; 
and 
10-11 
cm, 
in 
one 
spatial 
dimension. 
Those 
dimensions 
are 
larger 
than 
our 
minimum 
length; 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
reach 
them. 
But 
to 
obtain 
more 
than 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
it 
needs 
a 
measure 
smaller 
than 
our 
Planck 
length, 
and 
that 
is 
impossible. 
Besides 
that, 
going 
from 
a 
three 
spatial-dimensional 
space 
to 
a 
four-spatial-dimensional 
(noncompactified) 
one, 
changes 
the 
force 
equation 
of 
the 
gravitational 
field 
to 
an 
inverse 
cube-law 
instead 
of 
a 
normal 
inverse 
square–law. 
Notwithstanding, 
the 
distance 
among 
objects 
diminishes 
when 
the 
dimension 
increases. 
Gravity 
is 
the 
form 
of 
communication 
with 
other 
dimensional 
Universes. 
According 
to 
general 
relativity, 
gravity 
is 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
space-time 
and 
must 
permeate 
all 
dimensions. 



129. 
Mass 
concentration 
in 
Big 
Bang 
and 
medium 
black 
holes 
Similar 
to 
the 
former 
section, 
we 
can 
obtain 
similar 
answers 
by 
comparing 
the 
mass 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
with 
the 
corresponding 
cosmic 
mass, 
considering 
them 
to 
be 
of 
the 
same 
size: 
The 
space 
contains 
double 
the 
quantity 
of 
mass. 
We 
can 
apparently 
point 
out 
that 
this 
affirmation 
is 
false; 
but 
it 
is 
true. 
The 
problem 
is 
in 
our 
experience. 
We 
see 
the 
actual 
condition 
of 
the 
Universe 
(ρvacuum, 
approximately 
1.6 
x10-29 
g/cm3) 
and 
consider 
that 
black 
holes 
have 
minimum 
volume, 
and 
in 
consequence 
large 
densities. 
If 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
first 
stages 
of 
Universes, 
we 
could 
obtain 
a 
bigger 
concentration 
of 
mass, 
or 
a 
larger 
density. 
In 
effect, 
a 
black 
hole 
of 
Planck 
size 
has 
approximately 


6.17 
x1092 
g/cm3. 
Our 
Universe 
had 
in 
that 
moment 
approximately 
1.234 
x1093 
g/cm3, 
practically 
double. 
The 
Planck 
size 
in 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
(primordial; 
medium 
sized, 
formed 
from 
collapsing 
stars; 
or 
astronomical 
size, 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies) 
is 
a 
fundamental 
limit. 
Zero, 
or 
even 
sub-Planck 
distances 
are 
totally 
forbidden. 
There 
is 
no 
singularity 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes; 
there 
is 
only 
a 
co-singularity. 
When 
a 
black 
hole 
is 
“completely” 
evaporated, 
its 
mass 
and 
space 
will 
never 
become 
zero. 
The 
minimum 
would 
instead 
be 
Planck 
length 
and 
Planck 
mass 
respectively 
(approx. 
1.616 
x10-33 
cm 
and 
2.17 
x10-5 
g). 
This 
is 
basically 
the 
size 
and 
mass 
(and 
in 
consequence, 
energy) 
of 
the 
hole, 
unbounded, 
like 
a 
pore 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
naked 
singularity 
is 
only 
a 
mathematical 
error 
without 
a 
physical 
consequence. 
The 
cosmic 
space 
has 
pores, 
size 
λp, 
just 
like 
the 
human 
being, 
and 
this 
is 
derived 
from 
its 
own 
nature, 
independently 
if 
it 
comes 
from 
a 
dissipated 
black 
hole 
or 
not. 
These 
holes 
have 
a 
connection 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe.

Penrose 
process. 
Creation 
of 
virtual 
particles 
Roger 
Penrose 
explained 
and 
showed 
that 
between 
the 
static 
limit 
and 
the 
event 
horizon 
of 
any 
black 
hole, 
the 
ergosphere 
exists, 
and 
that 
energy 
could 
be 
extracted 
from 
it. 
In 
the 
future, 
human 
civilization 
could 
utilize 
it, 
but 
the 
Universe 
has 
been 
already 
using 
it 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
time. 
In 
the 
Penrose 
process, 
when 
an 
object 
falls 
into 
the 
ergosphere, 
it 
breaks 
into 
two 
separate 
pieces. 
One 
piece 
heads 
across 
the 
Event 
horizon 
but 
travels 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction 
to 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
hole 
(It 
is 
possible 
to 
do 
it, 
heading 
into 
the 
hole). 
The 
other 
piece 
heads 
out 
of 
the 
ergosphere, 
traveling 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
rotation. 
The 
mass 
of 
the 
black 
hole 
decreases 
a 
tiny 
amount, 
converting 
it 
into 
the 
energy 
of 
motion 
of 
the 
outgoing 
piece 
of 
the 
original 
object. 
If 
we 
take 
into 
account 
the 
Hawking 
radiation, 
the 
creation 
of 
virtual 
particles 
avoiding 
their 
annihilation 
next 
to 
the 
black 
hole, 
is 
a 
type 
of 
Penrose 
process; 
since 
the 
energy 
necessary 
to 
make 
the 
particles 
could 
come 
from 
the 
ergosphere. 
The 
antiparticle 
(opposite 
rotation) 
falls 
down 
into 
the 
hole 
and 
the 
particle 
with 
more 
energy 
goes 
outside 
of 
the 
hole. 
The 
Universe 
uses 
the 
combination 
of 
two 
holes; 
one 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
the 
other 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
in 
a 
CPT 
connection 
that 
we 
explained 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
this 
book, 
and 
that 
we 
will 
follow 
in 
the 
next 
section. 



131. 
Circular 
motion 
limit, 
where 
particle-
antiparticle 
pair 
is 
divided 
Besides 
that, 
like 
the 
Chandrasekhar 
limit 
in 
a 
collapsing 
star, 
two 
more 
limits 
exist 
in 
any 
black 
hole: 
Planck 
length, 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
black 
hole; 
and 
the 
circular 
motion 
limit, 
which 
is 
1.5 
times 
the 
size 
of 
the 
event 
horizon. 
The 
place 
where 
light 
rays 
are 
bent 
into 
a 
circle 
around 
the 
center 
of 
the 
black 
hole 
is 
not 
in 
the 
event 
horizon. 
That 
happens 
at 
a 
distance 
1.5 
times 
the 
event 
horizon 
radius. 
We 
can 
point 
out 
that 
this 
is 
the 
distance 
of 
sharpest 
influence 
of 
the 
black 
hole, 
and 
in 
this 
place, 
any 
light 
ray 
can 
stay 
in 
orbit 
around 
the 
black 
hole. 
This 
is 
the 
place 
where 
a 
pair 
of 
particle-antiparticle 
can 
be 
divided; 
the 
antiparticle 
with 
inverse 
rotation 
plunges 
into 
the 
black 
hole 
itself 
and 
the 
particle 
is 
bent 
around 
the 
hole 
and 
emerges 
front 
its 
vicinity 
following 
an 
open 
curve 
out 
into 
space 
again. 
The 
Big 
Bang 
acted 
like 
a 
black 
hole 
attached 
to 
another 
one 
(in 
our 
parallel 
Universe), 
each 
with 
λp 
size. 
Each 
hole 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
black 
and 
white. 
By 
a 
procedure 
that 
needs 
more 
study, 
this 
double 
mechanism 
sends 
antimatter 
(our 
waste) 
to 
the 
other 
Universe 
and 
receives 
matter 
(its 
waste) 
in 
the 
same 
quantity. 
In 
that 
way, 
matter 
and 
energy, 
are 
increasing 
in 
both 
Universes. 
In 
each 
Universe, 
the 
matter 
is 
gained 
and 
in 
consequence 
its 
energy 
increases. 
This 
increasing 
energy 
is 
balanced 
by 
the 
negative 
energy 
of 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
and 
the 
gravitational 
energy. 
Besides 
that, 
comparing 
both 
Universes, 
both 
are 
inverses: 
It’s 
gaining 
(+) 
and 
(-), 
the 
difference 
is 
also 
zero. 
Like 
we 
explained 
in 
former 
sections, 
the 
two 
black 
holes 
give 
us 
the 
formula 
to 
calculate 
the 
mass 
of 
our 
Universe, 
double 
of 
the 
mass 
corresponding 
to 
a 
black 
hole 
alone. 
Besides 
that, 
it's 
easy 
to 
show; 
according 
to 
the 
relation 
M/R 
(which 
is 
constant), 
that 
mass 
increases 
with 
the 
increase 
of 
cosmic 
space. 
The 
relation 
Rc2=GM, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
cosmic 
space 
or 
Rc2/G=M. 
Its 
mass 
is 
double 
than 
that 
of 
a 
black 
hole's 
Schwarzschild 
mass: 
Rc2/2G=M. 
It 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
λ 
double 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Schwarzschild 
radius 
to 
obtain 
the 
same 
mass. 



132. 
Arithmetical 
calculation 
on 
the 
increase 
of 
mass 
The 
process 
in 
which 
the 
Universe 
duplicates 
mass 
can 
be 
shown, 
considering 
the 
length 
when 
the 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
are 
divided 
in 
the 
circular 
motion 
ratio: 
(1.5 
of 
the 
Schwarzschild 
radius). 
In 
that 
moment, 
pairs 
of 
particles-antiparticles 
x 
1.5 
are 
produced. 
For 
example: 
if 
a 
black 
hole 
has 
ten 
mass 
units, 
the 
relation 
at 
1.5 
R 
would 
be 
fifteen 
units 
of 
(+) 
matter, 
and 
fifteen 
units 
of 
(-) 
antimatter. 
The 
matter 
of 
the 
black 
hole 
is 
(+). 
The 
15 
(+) 
units 
go 
outside 
of 
the 
Universe; 
ten 
of 
the 
fifteen 
(-) 
units 
are 
eliminated 
with 
the 
10 
(+) 
units 
of 
the 
black 
hole; 
so, 
an 
excess 
of 
5 
units 
of 
antimatter 
remains. 
With 
a 
connection 
with 
the 
other 
Universe, 
our 
Universe 
sends 
these 
five 
(-) 
units 
as 
waste. 
The 
opposite 
black 
hole, 
in 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
performs 
the 
inverse 
process, 
interchanging 
five 
(+) 
units 
of 
its 
waste 
(which 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
our 
matter). 
The 
arithmetical 
process 
is 
simple. 


15 
(+) 
units+5 
(+) 
units=20 
units 
of 
(+) 
matter 
in 
our 
Universe. 
15 
(-) 
units+5 
(-)units=20 
units 
of 
(-)antimatter 
in 
the 
other 
Universe. 


The 
mass 
was 
doubled 
in 
both. 
This 
detail 
is 
a 
simplified 
process. 



133. 
Gravity 
in 
black 
holes. 
Constants 
and 
variables 
of 
nature 
We 
need 
to 
add 
that: 


1. 
All 
black 
holes 
need 
their 
event 
horizons 
to 
have 
a 
radius 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
Planck 
(R 
≥ 
λp), 
and 
in 
that 
position, 
they 
act 
with 
gravitational 
waves. 
No 
particle 
alone 
can 
form 
a 
black 
hole. 
The 
mass 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
needs 
to 
be 
at 
least 
Planck 
mass. 
2. 
The 
quantum 
equations 
are 
correct 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes, 
where 
the 
size 
is 
λp, 
or 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
There, 
quantum 
gravity 
is 
correct. 
But 
if 
we 
study 
bigger 
sizes, 
we 
need 
to 
use 
the 
general 
theory 
of 
relativity, 
and 
not 
quantum 
mechanics. 
Black 
holes 
are 
heavier 
than 
Planck 
mass; 
the 
use 
of 
quantum 
mechanics 
is 
totally 
appropriate 
when 
the 
mass 
is 
Planck 
or 
less. 
3. 
There 
are 
no 
charged 
black 
holes. 
All 
black 
holes 
are 
uncharged. 
Remember 
that 
there 
is 
gravity 
even 
with 
only 
one 
graviton, 
and 
gravity 
collapses 
the 
electromagnetic 
or 
the 
quantum 
wave. 
4. 
The 
equations 
corresponding 
to 
both 
waves 
(gravitational 
and 
quantum) 
determine 
that 
since 
the 
first 
chronos, 
the 
values 
of 
G,C,ℏ 
are 
constant 
and 
so, 
they 
will 
go 
on 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Planck 
mass, 
Planck 
energy, 
and 
Planck 
length 
were 
established 
at 
the 
first 
chronos. 
M 
and 
R 
vary 
with 
time, 
in 
two 
relations: 
MR=K, 
in 
mass 
and 
λ 
of 
particles; 
and 
M/R=K 
in 
mass 
and 
light-radius 
of 
cosmic 
space. 
5. 
The 
formulas 
in 
both 
relations 
are 
equal 
only 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
in 
that 
way 
we 
can 
obtain 
every 
relation. 
Rc2=GM 
and 
ℏ=mcλ 


Rc2/G=M 
and 
ℏ/cλp 
=m 
Rc2/G=ℏ/cλp 


λp2c3=Gℏ 
λp2=(Gℏ)/c3 
and 
so, 
λp=±√(Gℏ/c3) 


All 
the 
other 
values 
can 
be 
obtained 
by 
the 
same 
way. 



134. 
Four 
energies 
of 
the 
Universe 
Because 
gravitational 
forces 
are 
normally 
attractive, 
it 
is 
necessary 
for 
work 
to 
be 
done 
in 
order 
to 
pull 
matter 
against 
its 
own 
gravity. 
That 
means 
that 
the 
gravitational 
energy 
is 
negative. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
appearance 
of 
more 
energy 
and 
matter 
could 
be 
exactly 
compensated 
by 
the 
negative 
gravitational 
energy 
of 
the 
newly 
created 
mass, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
no 
net 
energy 
has 
appeared 
and 
the 
principle 
of 
conservation 
of 
energy 
is 
maintained 
without 
change. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
the 
Universe 
contains 
two 
other 
energies: 
the 
positive 
kinetic 
energy 
and 
the 
negative 
energy 
produced 
by 
the 
cosmological 
constant. 
When 
mass 
increases, 
both 
energies 
increase 
too; 
but 
one 
is 
positive 
and 
the 
other 
is 
negative. 
By 
changing 
in 
the 
same 
quantity, 
the 
principle 
of 
conservation 
of 
energy 
is 
also 
maintained. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
compensate 
the 
four 
energies 
(two 
positive 
and 
two 
negatives), 
and 
to 
maintain 
intact 
the 
total 
net 
energy, 
if 
the 
change 
of 
each 
one 
has 
the 
same 
value. 
But 
according 
to 
the 
percentage 
of 
each 
of 
the 
energies; 
they 
have 
changed 
in 
different 
proportion, 
and 
their 
percentages 
have 
varied 
with 
time. 
For 
example, 
by 
comparing 
the 
percentage 
considered 
380,000 
years 
ago 
with 
the 
one 
in 
the 
actual 
moment 
of 
the 
Universe, 
we 
note 
that 
there 
is 
a 
big 
difference. 
These 
results 
need 
to 
be 
reviewed. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
four 
energies 
have 
incorporated 
mass 
in 
their 
formulas; 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
it 
is 
not 
an 
independent 
quantity, 
so, 
mass 
is 
included 
in 
all 
the 
energies. 
For 
example, 
the 
four 
energies, 
in 
an 
exact 
or 
approximate 
relation, 
are 
indicated 
by: 


Em=mc2 


Ec=(+1/2)mv2 
if 
v≅√2 
c, 
we 
have: 
Ec=+mc2 


Egrav 
= 
-GMm/R 
and 
Rc2/G=M 


(GMRc2)/GR=-mc2. 


EΛ=(-1/6)ΛmR2c2=-(1/6)(6/R2)mR2c2=-mc2 
And 
so: 
Et 
≅ 
+mc2 
+mc2-mc2-mc2 
≅ 
0=Ø 



135. 
Temperature 
and 
mass 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
The 
temperature 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
is 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
its 
mass. 
The 
emission 
of 
particles, 
according 
to 
this 
affirmation, 
is 
only 
enough 
in 
the 
primordial 
black 
holes; 
created 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
with 
appreciable 
T0. 
The 
medium 
black 
hole 
has 
a 
temperature 
of 
less 
than 
one 
microKelvin. 
In 
big 
black 
holes, 
the 
ones 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies, 
the 
temperature 
is 
even 
lower, 
and 
in 
consequence 
their 
evaporation 
is 
negligible. 
(Black 
holes 
can 
emit 
particles 
with 
a 
thermal 
spectrum, 
at 
a 
definite 
temperature, 
and 
this 
emission 
is 
larger 
when 
its 
temperature 
is 
hotter, 
and 
its 
mass 
is 
smaller). 
This 
is 
if 
we 
only 
consider 
temperature, 
but 
an 
analogous 
process 
involving 
gravity 
could 
also 
occur 
naturally. 
Near 
the 
surface 
of 
medium 
and 
big 
black 
holes 
gravity 
is 
so 
intense 
that 
the 
vacuum 
(or 
ergosphere 
space) 
can 
intervene 
with 
a 
continual 
stream 
of 
newly 
created 
pairs 
of 
particles-
antiparticles. 
In 
the 
classic 
Newtonian 
sense, 
gravitational 
force 
cannot 
produce 
particles; 
but 
in 
quantum 
mechanics 
(or 
in 
quantum 
cosmological), 
we 
could 
consider 
the 
spontaneous 
appearance 
of 
matter 
out 
of 
empty 
space, 
forming 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs. 
This 
is 
accepted, 
and 
it 
is 
referred 
as 
a 
creation 
out 
of 
nothing. 
If 
quantum 
mechanics 
allows, 
considering 
the 
temperature, 
for 
particles 
to 
pop 
to 
existence 
out 
of 
nowhere, 
this 
could 
also, 
using 
the 
quantum 
cosmological, 
apply 
to 
gravity, 
allowing 
space 
to 
come 
into 
existence 
out 
of 
nothing. 
And 
if 
gravity 
is 
a 
warping 
of 
space-time, 
we 
could 
say 
that 
gravity 
(and 
space-time) 
induce 
the 
creation 
of 
matter. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
primordial 
(mini) 
black 
holes 
can 
produce 
particle–antiparticle 
pairs, 
separate 
them, 
and 
interchange 
them 
with 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter 
by 
means 
of 
heat 
(temperature); 
but 
the 
medium 
and 
giant 
black 
holes 
could 
also 
do 
it 
by 
using 
gravity. 



136. 
Human 
and 
natural 
colliders 
Even 
the 
Standard 
Model 
doesn’t 
accept 
more 
than 
three 
families 
of 
particles. 
In 
consequence, 
it 
only 
considers 
particles 
that 
are 
no 
heavier 
than 
103 
GeV. 
In 
astronomical 
experiments, 
cosmic 
rays 
have 
been 
detected 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
earth 
with 
energies 
up 
to 
about 
1011 
GeV, 
containing 
very 
heavy 
particles. 
The 
origin 
of 
those 
particles 
is 
unknown, 
and 
constitutes 
an 
important 
puzzle. 
For 
us, 
a 
heavier 
scale 
exists, 
where 
the 
corresponding 
heavier 
partners 
of 
the 
normal 
particles 
are. 
Unlike 
the 
superpartners; 
the 
heavy 
partners 
have 
spin 
1/2, 
like 
all 
particles 
of 
matter, 
and 
they 
are 
localized 
in 
a 
similar 
(logarithmical) 
scale, 
as 
the 
known 
particles. 
They 
also 
begin 
from 
Planck 
mass 
/√(8π)=4.3285 
x10-6 
g 
or 
2.393653682 
x1018 
GeV 
(approx. 
2.4 
x1018 
GeV). 
According 
to 
this 
theory, 
the 
particles 
up 
and 
around 
1011 
GeV 
are 
the 
heaviest 
neutronio 
(neutronio3) 
equivalent 
to 
3 
x1010 
GeV. 
The 
cosmic 
rays 
are 
neutral, 
just 
like 
this 
neutronio3. 
This 
particle 
is 
unstable 
and 
decays 
rapidly 
into 
the 
LHP 
(lightest 
heavy 
partner), 
the 
neutronio1, 
with 
a 
mass 
of 
132 
GeV. 
Testing 
that 
colossal 
mass, 
3 
x1010 
GeV, 
using 
accelerators, 
is 
too 
expensive 
and 
too 
far 
away 
in 
the 
development 
of 
our 
current 
technology; 
but 
we 
could 
experiment 
using 
some 
of 
the 
natural 
colliders 
available 
to 
us, 
such 
as 
cosmic 
rays. 
The 
table 
with 
heavy-partners 
and 
their 
supposed 
masses 
were 
described 
in 
former 
sections.

Quantum 
foam 
and 
sub 
Planck 
distances 
The 
concept 
of 
a 
smooth 
spatial 
geometry, 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
general 
relativity, 
is 
destroyed 
by 
the 
violent 
fluctuations 
of 
the 
quantum 
world 
on 
shorter 
distances 
scales, 
or 
Sub-Planck 
lengths. 
John 
Wheeler 
used 
the 
term 
quantum 
foam 
to 
describe 
the 
disorder 
“revealed” 
by 
the 
ultramicroscopic 
examination 
of 
space 
(and 
time), 
by 
using 
distances 
below 
Planck 
length. 
In 
those 
distances, 
the 
traditional 
notions 
of 
right 
and 
left, 
forth 
and 
back, 
up 
and 
down, 
and 
after 
and 
before, 
lose 
their 
meaning. 
If 
we 
follow 
a 
decreasing 
distance, 
we 
will 
arrive 
at 
zero 
distance 
and 
quantum 
mechanics 
or 
the 
general 
relativity 
yield 
the 
same 
ridiculous 
answers, 
infinities. 
These 
violent 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
spatial 
fabric 
at 
distances 
shorter 
the 
Planck 
length 
and 
infinities, 
using 
distance 
0, 
are 
mathematical 
errors. 


The 
space 
0 
or 
sub-Planck 
distances 
don’t 
exist 
in 
our 
physical 
world. 


Notwithstanding, 
even 
considering 
a 
minimum 
Planck 
distance, 
like 
the 
one 
the 
Superstring 
theory 
takes 
into 
account, 
the 
quantum 
wave 
and 
the 
gravitational 
wave 
act 
separately; 
except 
in 
the 
first 
chronos, 
just 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
where 
both 
waves, 
act 
unified 
and 
in 
real 
existence. 
In 
summary: 


• 
Space 
0 
doesn't 
exist. 
• 
Sub-Planck 
lengths 
don't 
exist. 
(Planck 
length 
is 
the 
minimum 
size). 
• 
At 
Planck 
length, 
both 
waves 
(gravitational 
and 
quantum) 
act 
together, 
related 
to 
the 
same 
object. 
• 
At 
distances 
longer 
than 
Planck 
length, 
both 
waves 
can 
act, 
but 
separately. 
• 
Quantum 
waves 
act 
from 
Planck 
length 
to 
0.687289278 
cm 
in 
particles; 
with 
Planck 
length 
having 
the 
minimum 
value, 
and 
Planck 
mass 
having 
the 
maximum 
value. 
• 
Gravitational 
waves 
act 
from 
Planck 
length 
to 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
the 
Universe. 
It 
is 
attractive 
at 
short 
distances 
and 
repulsive 
at 
astronomical 
distances. 
The 
minimum 
cosmic 
mass 
is 
Planck 
mass. 
• 
The 
paradox 
of 
measure 
is 
not 
determined 
by 
its 
length. 
It 
is 
preferably 

determined 
by 
its 
mass. 
Planck 
mass, 
and 
not 
Planck 
length, 
is 
the 
frontier 
between 
both. 


• 
Quantum 
gravity 
can 
act 
at 
distances 
exactly 
as 
Planck 
length, 
that 
is, 
basically 
the 
size 
of 
the 
string 
in 
superstring 
theory. 

138. 
Vibrational 
patterns 
and 
extremely 
heavy 
particles 
In 
String 
theory, 
some 
vibrational 
patterns 
exist 
that 
correspond 
to 
extremely 
heavy 
particles, 
and 
the 
term 
"heavy" 
means 
many 
times 
heavier 
than 
Planck 
mass. 
This 
is 
a 
wrong 
concept. 
The 
maximum 
mass 
for 
the 
heaviest 
particle 
is 
Planck 
mass 
divided 
by 
√(8π). 
Planck 
mass 
is 
the 
maximum 
mass 
for 
the 
first 
Higgs 
field, 
which 
contains 
a 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
with 
a 
quadrupole 
of 
heavy–quark 
particles, 
in 
which 
the 
mass 
of 
each 
of 
them 
is 
approx. 
2.4 
x1018 
GeV. 
This 
is 
according 
to 
a 
basic 
String 
theory: 
“The 
more 
typical 
vibrating 
fundamental 
string 
corresponds 
to 
a 
particle 
whose 
mass 
is 
around 
1018 
greater 
than 
a 
proton”. 
“The 
length 
of 
the 
Higgs 
fields 
can 
increase 
until 
approximately 
one 
cm, 
(exactly 
0.687289278 
cm) 
obtaining 
in 
this 
λ, 
the 
lightest 
particle, 
the 
neutrino 
1. 
The 
mass 
of 
particles 
follows 
the 
uncertainty 
principle 
and 
so, 
when 
λ 
is 
longer, 
its 
mass 
is 
lighter. 
Particles 
act 
with 
quantum 
waves. 
Matter 
with 
many 
times 
Planck 
mass, 
exists 
in 
the 
cosmic 
space 
that 
uses 
the 
gravitational 
waves, 
and 
its 
relation 
with 
length 
(light-radius 
of 
the 
Universe) 
is 
directly 
proportional. 
In 
that 
way, 
longer 
radii 
mean 
more 
mass, 
according 
to 
the 
relation: 
Rc2/G≅M; 
but 
cosmic 
space 
is 
electrically 
neutral 
and 
it 
is 
not 
composed 
by 
independent 
particles, 
but 
by 
aggregated 
matter 
or 
complex 
structures. 



139. 
Fabric 
of 
space-time 
Einstein’s 
General 
theory 
of 
relativity 
says 
that 
the 
fabric 
of 
space 
cannot 
tear; 
and 
we 
can 
add: 
until 
the 
Universe 
begins 
to 
develop 
the 
fourth 
spatial 
dimension, 
beginning 
from 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
our 
Universe, 
using 
fractal 
dimensions, 
until 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
new 
dimension 
(Big 
Crush). 
Besides 
that, 
our 
Universe 
has 
holes 
in 
all 
of 
its 
extension, 
with 
size 
λp 
each, 
like 
“pores”. 
These 
holes 
are 
unbounded 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
can’t 
be 
divided 
in 
a 
length 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length. 
If 
we 
use 
quantum 
mechanics 
equations 
and 
its 
rules, 
we 
obtain 
a 
lot 
of 
absurdities 
in 
our 
macrocosmos, 
which 
are 
much 
more 
than 
simple 
paradoxes. 
But, 
like 
we 
insist 
in 
many 
sections 
of 
this 
book, 
quantum 
mechanics 
can 
act 
gravitationally 
speaking, 
but 
just 
in 
the 
first 
chronos. 
In 
that 
moment, 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
space 
doesn’t 
need 
to 
tear, 
puncture 
or 
separate. 
It 
is 
completely 
separated. 
It 
is 
a 
simple 
hole, 
with 
size 
λp=1.615979906 
x1033 
cm. 
By 
stretching 
the 
space, 
irregularities 
could 
develop 
in 
its 
fabric, 
but 
space 
can 
never 
tear 
or 
have 
contact 
with 
an 
additional 
spatial 
dimension; 
because 
physically, 
the 
tearing 
would 
have 
to 
be 
necessarily 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length, 
and 
this 
is 
impossible 
in 
our 
Universe. 
If 
that 
could 
be 
possible, 
our 
Universe 
would 
collapse, 
demolish, 
or 
tear 
down 
completely, 
like 
it 
will 
happen 
in 
the 
Big 
Crush. 



140. 
Physical 
impossibilities 
due 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
gravitational 
wave 
From 
a 
mathematical 
standpoint, 
space 
can 
tear, 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
travel 
to 
the 
past. 
But 
physically, 
it 
is 
impossible, 
like 
Einstein 
insisted. 


The 
manipulation 
of 
Calabi-Yau 
shapes, 
call 
for 
the 
mathematicians 
flop 
transitions, 
they 
can 
do 
it 
because 
the 
Calabi-Yau 
is 
a 
multidimensional 
nugget, 
and 
the 
String 
theory 
considers 
that 
all 
dimensions 
have 
the 
same 
footing. 
In 
the 
physical 
reality, 
a 
colossal 
difference 
exists 
in 
the 
length 
of 
dimensions, 
and 
we 
can 
only 
draw 
them 
using 
logarithmical 
values. 
Ex.: 
Planck, 
in 
the 
four 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe 
is 
1.896333025x10-44 
cm 
with 
a 
difference 
between 
the 
Planck 
of 
our 
Universe 
of 
8.52x1010 
(equivalent 
to 
85.2 
billion). 


Any 
macrocosmos 
acts 
using 
the 
coherent 
gravitational 
waves; 
the 
quantum 
waves 
are 
for 
particles. 
This 
is 
a 
fundamental 
principle 
in 
the 
physical 
world. 


If 
particles 
could 
use 
gravitational 
waves, 
an 
atom 
of 
hydrogen 
would 
need 
to 
interact 
with 
a 
bigger 
orbit 
than 
the 
entire 
known 
universe. 
If 
the 
macrocosmos 
could 
use 
quantum 
waves, 
it 
would 
immediately 
collapse. 



141. 
Parallel 
Universe 
and 
interchange 
of 
matter-antimatter 
The 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter, 
which 
is 
based 
in 
the 
gravitational 
wave, 
has 
the 
same 
fundamental 
constants 
ℏ, 
G, 
C, 
in 
value 
and 
sign, 
like 
ours. 
All 
of 
them 
are 
positives. 
Two 
fundamental 
variables: 
R 
and 
M, 
have 
the 
same 
value, 
but 
with 
an 
opposite 
sign. 
Derived 
from 
this, 
energy 
has 
the 
same 
relation. 
Another 
variable, 
time, 
has 
also 
the 
same 
value, 
but 
with 
an 
opposite 
sign. 
Both 
Universes 
began, 
and 
will 
end 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
The 
difference 
of 
space 
between 
them 
is 
always 
2λp 
(λp 
in 
each 
Universe). 
In 
the 
creation 
of 
particle–antiparticle 
pairs, 
in 
each 
Universe, 
both 
have 
the 
same 
production 
and 
the 
same 
proportion 
(50%-50%). 
The 
particle– 
antiparticle 
pairs 
are 
destroyed 
immediately 
when 
they 
are 
joined. 
But 
to 
increase 
the 
matter, 
they 
need 
to 
be 
separated; 
and 
this 
process 
appears 
to 
be 
done 
by 
means 
of 
black 
holes. 
At 
least, 
this 
process 
is 
more 
logical 
than 
the 
actual 
supposed 
process 
that 
states 
that: 
“Our 
Universe 
is 
a 
result 
of 
an 
error 
of 
nature, 
which 
after 
a 
long 
process, 
exact 
and 
totally 
inefficient, 
approximately 
109 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs 
were 
destroyed 
to 
obtain 
only 
one 
particle." 
This 
process 
is 
ugly 
and 
unnatural, 
and 
deserves 
to 
be 
discarded. 
Dirac’s 
prediction 
that 
for 
every 
particle 
variety 
an 
antiparticle 
counterpart 
exists 
is 
an 
essential 
truth 
of 
indescribable 
beauty 
and 
profound 
symmetry. 
It 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
find 
a 
logical 
and 
beautiful 
complementary 
process, 
to 
separate 
them, 
in 
order 
to 
form 
only 
matter 
(in 
our 
Universe). 
The 
process 
of 
destroying 
all 
antiparticles 
unilaterally, 
or 
of 
forming 
antimatter 
and 
sending 
it 
to 
the 
farther 
sections 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
a 
failed 
and 
inexistent 
process. 



142. 
Antimatter; 
production 
of 
antimatter 
The 
creation 
of 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs 
(50%-50%) 
is 
common 
in 
our 
Universe. 
But 
the 
antiparticles 
that 
are 
far 
away 
from 
black 
holes 
are 
destroyed 
almost 
immediately. 
Even 
mesons, 
which 
are 
formed 
by 
matter 
and 
antimatter, 
have 
a 
short 
lifespan. 
When 
a 
quark 
and 
an 
antiquark 
are 
confined 
to 
a 
miniature 
Universe 
(whose 
extent 
is 
10-10 
cm) 
they 
will 
meet 
and 
will 
consequently 
be 
annihilated 
almost 
immediately. 
Any 
antiparticle 
has 
its 
destruction 
in 
our 
world 
of 
matter. 
Antimatter 
(or 
antiparticles) 
is 
all-
destructive 
in 
our 
universe. 
For 
antimatter 
to 
be 
useful, 
we 
must 
contain 
it 
away 
from 
any 
piece 
of 
matter. 
The 
solution 
is 
more 
expensive 
than 
any 
production 
of 
derived 
energy. 
We 
need 
to 
have 
a 
vacuum, 
even 
emptier 
than 
outer 
space, 
with 
magnetic 
and 
electric 
fields 
that 
confine 
the 
antiparticles 
(positrons 
or 
antiprotons 
for 
example) 
as 
circulating 
beams, 
like 
an 
energy 
recipient 
without 
material 
walls. 
With 
modern 
apparatus, 
it's 
possible 
to 
store 
a 
small 
quantity 
of 
charged 
antiparticles 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
But 
antiatoms, 
antineutrons 
or 
any 
kind 
of 
neutral 
antiparticles 
can’t 
be 
hold 
by 
electric 
and 
magnetic 
fields, 
and 
because 
of 
that 
it 
is 
more 
difficult 
to 
store 
them. 
The 
neutral 
antiparticles 
are 
annihilated 
almost 
immediately 
after 
coming 
into 
contact 
with 
normal 
matter 
or 
normal 
particles. 
It 
is 
almost 
impossible 
to 
create 
antimatter 
in 
our 
Universe. 
Even 
the 
simplest 
form 
of 
antimatter, 
the 
antihydrogen 
atom, 
formed 
artificially 
by 
an 
antiproton 
with 
a 
positron, 
is 
extremely 
difficult 
to 
form. 
In 
1996, 
CERN 
produced 
only 
nine 
antiatoms 
and 
had 
an 
enormous 
propaganda 
around 
the 
world. 
But 
they 
only 
lived 
for 
a 
small 
fraction 
of 
a 
second; 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
store 
them 
to 
be 
used 
for 
further 
studies 
and 
were 
destroyed 
almost 
immediately 
by 
matter 
in 
their 
surroundings. 
Later, 
in 
2002, 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
produce 
a 
small 
quantity 
of 
antihydrogen 
atoms, 
but 
all 
were 
obtained 
with 
difficult 
and 
artificial 
projects. 
To 
obtain 
antimatter 
in 
more 
complex 
forms 
in 
our 
Universe 
is 
an 
almost 
impossible 
task, 
and 
if 
it 
is 
reached, 
is 
by 
means 
of 
artificial 
and 
expensive 
projects 
and 
it 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
obtain 
minimum 
quantities. 
We 
know 
that 
the 
CPT 
theorem 
shows 
that 
matter 
and 
antimatter 
must 
be 
symmetric 
when 
all 
CPT 
operations 
are 
applied. 
This 
needs 
a 
symmetric 
and 



parallel 
Universe 
where 
antimatter 
lives. 
But 
scientists 
still 
debate 
if 
matter 
and 
antimatter 
have 
to 
be 
symmetrical 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
gravity. 



143. 
Gravity 
and 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
We 
accept 
the 
CPT 
theorem; 
and 
in 
that 
position, 
a 
parallel 
Universe, 


gravitationallyattachedtoours,isnecessary.
In 
two 
spatial 
dimensions, 
they 
are 
always 
increasingly 
separating. 
But 
we 
live 
in 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
so, 
both 
Universes 
are 
always 
separated 
by 
2λp 
(λp 
each) 
at 
any 
point 
in 
their 
fabrics. 


G, 
ℏ, 
c 
are 
positive 
constants 
in 
both 
Universes. 
Because 
of 
that, 
gravity 
is 
symmetrical 
in 
both. 
Gravity 
is 
completely 
attractive 
at 
small 
distances. 
Both 
Universes 
began 
with 
a 
similar 
Big 
Bang 
and 
they 
are 
continuously 
expanding 
in 
the 
same 
proportion. 



Antimatter 
falls 
down 
in 
an 
anti-earth’s 
gravitational 
field; 
and 
it 
experiments 
repulsion 
or 
expansion 
at 
astronomical 
scales 
(like 
in 
our 
Universe). 
Antiparticles 
are 
nature's 
particle's 
mirrors. 
And 
like 
we 
affirmed 
in 
this 
book, 
antiparticles 
and 
particles 
don’t 
fall 
down 
or 
rise 
up 
under 
gravity. 
Its 
gravitational 
wave 
is 
always 
virtual, 
and 
has 
no 
reality 
in 
our 
Universe 
since 
their 
sizes 
are 
always 
less 
than 
Planck 
length. 
Every 
particle 
and 
antiparticle 
acts 
with 
a 
real 
quantum 
wave. 
And 
it 
is 
not 
only 
attraction 
and 
repulsion; 
it 
also 
has 
influence 
in 
the 
kind 
of 
spin, 
especially 
in 
neutral 
particles. 
As 
an 
incoherent 
wave, 
it 
behaves 
based 
on 
quantum 
mechanic 
rules; 
including 
its 
wave–particle 
duality, 
and 
specially, 
the 
uncertainty 
principle. 
Also, 
like 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
aggregated 
matter 
(mass 
> 
2.17 
x10-5 
g 
or 
> 
1.2 
x1019 
GeV) 
acts 
with 
gravitational 
waves; 
and 
after 
the 
first 
chronos 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
cosmic 
space 
acts 
with 
it 
(quantum 
gravity 
is 
only 
adequate 
in 
the 
first 
chronos 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
where 
gravity 
and 
the 
other 
three 
forces 
were 
united). 
After 
that 
and 
until 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe, 
we 
need 
to 
use 
Einstein’s 
theory 
of 
General 
relativity. 
This 
theory 
indirectly 
indicates 
that 
antimatter 
will 
fall 
down 
to 
earth 
at 
the 
same 
rate 
as 
matter. 
But 
remember, 
antimatter 
needs 
an 
anti-earth 
that 
exists 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universes. 
If 
antimatter 
would 
fall 
down 
to 
our 
earth, 
it 
would 
be 
destroyed 
in 
a 
minimal 
fraction 
of 
one 
second 
(annihilated 
with 
surrounding 
matter). 



144.Gravitational 
relation 
between 
extradimensional 
Universes 


In 
this 
book, 
we 
have 
considered 
a 
parallel 
Universe 
to 
be 
gravitationally 
coherent; 
and 
different 
worlds 
existing 
in 
dimensional 
moduli, 
according 
to 
new 
involved 
dimensions. 
These 
new 
worlds 
are 
mathematically 
ordered 
with 
our 
world 
in 
a 
coherent 
manner. 
For 
example, 
the 
distance 
between 
our 
universe 
and 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
is 
2λp 
(λp 
in 
each), 
and 
if 
an 
infinitesimal 
part 
of 
Planck 
length 
is 
changed 
in 
any 
part 
of 
those 
Universes, 
both 
Universes 
would 
collapse. 
The 
other 
dimensional 
Universes 
are 
ruled 
by 
different 
Planck 
and 
maximum 
lengths, 
in 
moduli 
related 
among 
them 
in 
multidimensional 
packages. 
All 
of 
them 
are 
mathematically 
related 
and 
coherently 
united. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
following 
concept 
is 
fundamental: 
The 
relation 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
and 
the 
other 
extra-dimensional 
Universes 
is 
by 
means 
of 
the 
gravitational 
force. 
In 
any 
creation 
of 
any 
Universe 
or 
in 
its 
destruction, 
in 
the 
beginning 
and 
in 
the 
end, 
gravity 
has 
the 
same 
value 
as 
the 
other 
forces 
of 
that 
Universe. 


These 
ordered 
Universes, 
product 
of 
gravitational 
waves 
(gravitational 
Universes), 
don’t 
have 
any 
relation 
with 
the 
cofinite 
Universes 
(even 
infinite 
for 
some) 
that 
act 
with 
quantum 
mechanic 
rules; 
and 
in 
consequence 
with 
quantum 
and 
incoherent 
waves: 
Multiverse, 
Megaverse, 
Metaverse, 
Multiples 
Universes, 
Quilted 
Universes, 
Bubble 
Universes, 
Parallel 
Universes, 
Alternate 
Universes, 
Parallel 
words, 
etc.; 
which 
are 
obtained 
by 
researchers 
trying 
to 
resolve 
puzzling 
aspects 
of 
quantum 
mechanics. 
Putting 
cofinite 
Universes 
(10500) 
or 
even, 
infinite 
Universes, 
in 
random 
conditions, 
would 
conduce 
to 
the 
permanent 
destruction 
of 
them 
(including 
our 
Universe), 
similar 
to 
the 
annihilations 
of 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs. 



145. 
Dual 
nature 
of 
all 
forces; 
gravity 
But 
if 
gravity 
is 
attractive 
at 
shorter 
distances 
and 
repulsive 
at 
cosmic 
distances, 
what 
happened 
with 
gravity 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe? 
At 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
the 
Universe 
only 
had 
one 
size: 
Planck 
length, 
and 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
have 
a 
smaller 
size 
than 
Planck 
length. 
Definitely, 
in 
that 
moment, 
only 
expansion 
existed, 
and 
we 
are 
not 
talking 
about 
the 
inflation, 
which 
came 
into 
existence 
later, 
according 
to 
the 
valid 
theory. 
Considering 
that 
gravity 
is 
always 
attractive, 
Alan 
Guth 
suggested 
that 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
for 
a 
very 
short 
period 
of 
time 
afterwards, 
gravity 
effectively 
reversed. 
Instead 
of 
pulling 
things 
together, 
it 
pushed 
them 
apart 
at 
immense 
speed. 
Guth 
didn’t 
explain 
why. 
But 
the 
explanation 
is 
logical. 
With 
minimum 
size, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
shrink 
space; 
there 
is 
only 
one 
way 
to 
go, 
and 
that 
is 
outward. 
If 
gravity 
were 
to 
be 
always 
attractive, 
then, 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
(with 
maximum 
gravity 
density) 
an 
expansion 
of 
the 
universe 
would 
be 
impossible. 
The 
Universe 
would 
remain 
as 
a 
compact 
mass, 
with 
no 
possibility 
of 
shrinking 
or 
stretching. 
The 
dual 
nature 
of 
all 
forces, 
the 
principle 
of 
attraction–repulsion, 
is 
common 
in 
all 
of 
them, 
including 
gravity. 
Besides 
that, 
Universes 
with 
odd 
spatial 
dimensions 
begin 
from 
a 
minimum 
length 
(Big 
Bang) 
and 
expand 
continuously 
to 
a 
maximum 
length. 
The 
Universes, 
with 
even 
spatial 
dimensions, 
begin 
from 
a 
maximum 
length 
(Big 
Crunch) 
and 
shrink 
to 
a 
minimum 
length. 
Between 
them, 
an 
area 
of 
fractal 
dimension 
exists, 
where 
the 
old 
Universe 
is 
destroyed 
while 
the 
new 
dimension 
is 
developed 
(Big 
Crush). 
In 
both 
Big 
Crushes, 
from 
even 
to 
odd 
and 
from 
odd 
to 
even 
spatial 
dimensions, 
we 
have, 
in 
the 
so-called 
Einstein 
frame 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe, 
an 
evolution 
that 
would 
be 
described 
as 
an 
accelerating 
contraction 
phase, 
and 
an 
accelerating 
expansion 
phase, 
respectively. 
Besides 
that, 
Einstein’s 
limit 
(speed 
of 
light) 
applies 
only 
to 
matter. 
Space, 
as 
an 
abstract 
unit, 
can 
(and 
of 
course 
does) 
expands 
or 
contracts 
faster 
than 
light. 



146. 
Fruitless 
search 
for 
superpartners 
The 
search 
for 
superpartners 
is 
still 
infructuous, 
and 
by 
trying 
to 
find 
an 
unknown 
new 
possible 
symmetry, 
we 
lose 
other 
known 
symmetries. 
One 
of 
them 
is 
the 
symmetric 
relation 
of 
masses. 
For 
example, 
the 
neutrino 
and 
the 
Top 
quark 
have 
a 
relation 
between 
them 
of 
approx. 
1.5 
x1016. 
And 
the 
sneutrino, 
the 
partner 
of 
the 
neutrino, 
still 
doesn’t 
appears. 
When 
will 
the 
stop, 
the 
partner 
of 
Top 
quark, 
appear? 
In 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
symmetry, 
the 
superpartners 
need 
to 
have 
a 
symmetrical 
relation 
among 
them 
and 
there 
is 
not 
enough 
space 
to 
do 
it. 
In 
their 
search, 
with 
new 
accelerators, 
the 
answer 
has 
been: 
they 
must 
be 
heavier. 
This 
next 
argument 
is 
common 
among 
most 
particle 
physicists: 
“If 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
the 
superpartners 
are 
slightly 
more 
massive 
than 
what 
can 
be 
produced 
at 
this 
Collider 
(LHC), 
it 
would 
take 
higher 
energies 
to 
reveal 
them, 
and 
a 
long 
wait 
for 
a 
new 
machine 
that 
will 
eventually 
replace 
it”. 
Notice 
it 
said 
“slightly” 
more 
massive, 
because 
the 
space 
available 
is 
almost 
canceled 
by 
the 
supposition 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
that 
Higgs 
field 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat 
in 
shorter 
scales; 
and 
so, 
the 
space 
available 
is 
even 
smaller. 
It’s 
necessary 
to 
expand 
the 
range 
among 
these 
heavier 
masses, 
as 
we 
used 
with 
the 
heavy 
partners. 
The 
neutronio, 
that 
we 
explained 
before 
is 
the 
heavy 
partner 
of 
the 
neutrino 
that 
could 
be 
found 
at 
132 
GeV. 
This 
could 
be 
a 
good 
possibility 
to 
find 
a 
new 
and 
unexpected 
particle 
that 
goes 
beyond 
the 
Standard 
Model. 
A 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
will 
appear, 
later 
and 
heavier. 



147. 
Symmetry 
among 
forces 
in 
the 
Standard 
Model 
and 
String 
Theory 
The 
symmetry 
among 
the 
different 
forces 
meets 
up 
and 
merges 
into 
one 
(in 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
they 
come 
close, 
but 
never 
become 
equal). 
In 
String 
theory, 
a 
common 
point 
doesn't 
only 
exists, 
but 
it 
exists 
in 
three 
different 
opportunities: 
1015K 
electromagnetic-weak 
force; 
1028K 
strong-weakelectromagnetic 
force; 
and 
just 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
at 
1032K 
unifying 
the 
four 
forces 
(including 
gravity). 
Without 
string 
symmetry 
only 
three 
forces 
almost 
(but 
not 
exactly) 
meet. 
Gravity 
is 
completely 
ignored. 
In 
fixed 
moments, 
temperature, 
and 
λ, 
when 
the 
forces 
meet, 
a 
Higgs 
boson 
appears. 
The 
first 
(Higgs 
weak 
boson) 
is 
next 
to 
appear. 
(it's 
the 
last 
if 
we 
begin 
from 
Planck 
length) 
But 
other 
two 
exist, 
according 
to 
the 
String 
theory, 
where 
the 
forces 
meet. 



The 
moments 
of 
meeting 
and 
appearance 
of 
the 
corresponding 
Higgs 
boson. 



The 
electromagnetic 
boson 
is 
the 
photon, 
and 
its 
mass 
at 
rest 
is 
always 
0. 
The 
Higgs 
electromagnetic 
boson 
doesn't 
exist. 



148. 
Differences 
between 
masses 
of 
known 
particles 
The 
difference 
among 
masses 
of 
the 
known 
particles 
is 
enormous 
and 
needs 
an 
explanation. 
The 
actual 
theory 
indicates 
that 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
particles. 
But 
this 
answer 
has 
some 
obstacles. 
One 
of 
them 
is, 
why 
do 
some 
particles 
get 
bogged 
down 
in 
Higgs 
field 
more 
than 
others? 
The 
heaviest 
quark, 
the 
top, 
has 
a 
mass 
of 
approx. 
174 
GeV 
and 
the 
electron 
has 
only 
5.11x10-4 
GeV, 
which 
means 
that 
the 
top 
is 
340,500 
times 
heavier 
than 
the 
electron. 
If 
we 
consider 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
neutrino, 
the 
difference 
is 
even 
bigger 
(around 
1016 
times 
heavier). 
Moreover, 
the 
Standard 
Model 
recognizes 
only 
one 
Higgs 
boson 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
it 
could 
be 
called, 
the 
“King 
of 
creation”. 
Others 
consider 
it 
the 
“God 
particle”, 
or 
practically 
“our 
creator”. 
But 
Superstring 
theory 
considers 
at 
least 
one 
other 
Higgs 
boson, 
including 
the 
strong 
force; 
and 
supposes 
another 
Higgs 
boson, 
including 
gravity. 
If 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
quarks 
and 
electrons 
a 
means 
to 
obtain 
mass, 
why 
can't 
we 
consider 
the 
same 
miraculous 
task 
for 
the 
other 
two? 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
gravitational 
Higgs 
boson 
that 
existed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
Universe, 
would 
be 
giving 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
since 
the 
first 
chronos. 
And 
so, 
the 
existence 
of 
two 
other 
supersymmetric 
Higgs 
bosons 
would 
destroy 
the 
supposition 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model: 
that 
before 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
the 
particles 
were 
without 
mass, 
and 
moreover, 
that 
another 
heavier 
scale 
doesn’t 
exist. 
For 
us, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
only 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
(W+, 
W-, 
Z0). 
But 
even 
if 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
could 
give 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter; 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
and 
the 
Higgs 
strong 
boson 
would 
allow 
it 
to 
give 
mass 
to 
very 
heavy 
particles, 
where 
the 
top 
quark 
would 
be, 
a 
relatively 
light 
particle. 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
totally 
unstable, 
and 
it 
decays 
into 
known 
particles, 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
heavier 
than 
all 
known 
particles, 
including 
the 
top 
quark. 
It 
is 
very 
important 
to 
take 
this 
into 
account 
when 
the 
results 
of 
the 
LHC 
experiments 
are 
considered. 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
joins 
quarks 
by 
means 
of 
the 
weak 
force, 
which 
acts 
in 
all 
particles 
(except 
gluons 
and 
photons). 
Without 
the 
strong 
force, 
mesons 
are 
not 
formed. 
With 
the 
strong 
force, 
the 
top 
quark 
would 
be 
lighter. 



149. 
Reciprocal 
relation 
between 
minimum 
and 
maximum 
space 
We 
affirmed 
that 
a 
reciprocal 
relation 
between 
maximum 
and 
minimum 
space 
in 
a 
determined 
dimensional 
Universe 
exists, 
but 
it 
has 
a 
small 
asymmetry. 
For 
example, 
our 
Universe 
has 
a 
Planck 
length 
equivalent 
to 
1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm 
and 
a 
maximum 
length 
equivalent 
to 
2.923096699 
x1032 
cm. 
If 
we 
multiply 
both, 
we 
obtain 
a 
quantity 
equivalent 
to 
0.472366552 
or 
e-0.75, 
whose 
inverse 
is 
1/2.117000017 
or 
1/e0.75. 
We 
can 
also 
obtain 
this 
by 
means 
of 
a 
T-duality 
in 
String 
theory, 
usually 
in 
a 
toroidally 
compactified 
theory. 
Most 
notable 
is 
the 
R→α'/R' 
duality, 
which 
relates 
a 
string 
theory, 
compactified 
on 
large 
and 
small 
tori, 
by 
interchanging 
winding 
(or 
vibrational) 
and 
wounded 
modes. 
If 
we 
put 
the 
values 
in 
the 
string 
T-
duality 
formula 
we 
have: 
RR'=α 
cm2 
Where 
α 
is: 


α=(2.923096699 
x1032 
cm) 
x 
(1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm) 
= 
0.4723665522 
cm2 


or 
e-0.75 
cm2 


Considering 
two 
eigenstate 
positions, 
we 
can 
also 
relate 
the 
wounded 
and 
winding 
mode. 
To 
obtain 
the 
relation 
without 
a 
unit 
of 
measure, 
we 
need 
to 
use 
a 
constant: 
k=1cm-2, 
and 
so 
kRR'= 
α. 
α 
can 
also 
be 
obtained 
by 
considering 
the 
differences 
of 
the 
projection 
of 
spatial 
dimensions. 
In 
vibration 
modes, 
it 
only 
has 
three 
ways, 
in 
our 
Universe 
at 
Planck 
length, 
equivalent 
to 
n. 
In 
wounded 
mode, 
with 
a 
movement 
over 
2n 
ways, 
it 
has 
n.2n 
=2n2. 
A 
dimensional 
modulus 
of 
8 
spatial 
dimensions 
has 
28 
components, 
and 
so, 
the 
relation 
between 
both 
is 
e3/
28∙e-18/28 
= 
e-21/28 
= 
e-0.75 
= 
0.472366552 
or 
1/2.117000017. 
With 
String 
theory, 
we 
avoid 
the 
singularities 
or 
infinities 
obtained 
by 
traditional 
point 
particles 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
three 
components 
of 
our 
world 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
have 
the 
same 
footing, 
like 
string 
theory 
considers, 
but 
with 
a 
difference: 
each 
Universe 
has 
components 
of 
the 
same 
footing 
among 
them, 
but 
a 
different 
one 
between 
a 
Universe 
with 
a 
different 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions.

Grand 
Unification 
scale 
The 
Grand 
Unification 
scale 
MGUT, 
which 
according 
to 
the 
String 
theory, 
states 
that 
the 
SU(3) 
x 
SU(2) 
x 
U(1) 
are 
united 
into 
a 
simple 
group. 
The 
agreement, 
between 
the 
supersymmetric 
prediction 
and 
the 
actual, 
means 
that 
the 
three 
gauge 
coupling 
meet, 
with 


MGUT= 
1016.1±0.3 
GeV 
αGUT-1≈25 


But 
differently, 
the 
nonsupersymmetric 
case 
considers 
that 
the 
three 
couplings 
do 
not 
meet 
at 
a 
single 
point, 
and 
that 
their 
contacts 
range 
from 
1013 
GeV 
to 
1017 
GeV. 
Our 
position 
is 
that 
String 
theory 
is 
correct 
in 
this 
sense. 
Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
point 
of 
unification 
of 
strong 
+ 
electromagnetic 


+ 
weak 
forces 
is 
at 
k-22π 
(in 
logarithmical 
scale) 
and 
this 
is 
equivalent 
to: 
ln-69.21325266=λ=8.731046397 
x10-31 
cm=2.221039623 
x1016 
GeV 
Which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
log16.34655631, 
which 
is 
approximately 
exact 
inside 
the 
range 
of 
supersymmetric 
MGUT. 
This 
energy 
is 
for 
the 
entire 
field, 
and 
in 
that 
position, 
the 
corresponding 
fractional 
value, 
would 
be 
4.43033306 
x1015 
GeV, 
logarithmically 
equivalent 
to 
1015.64643638. 


In 
this 
manner, 
the 
values 
would 
be 
16.35 
and 
15.65. 
This 
range 
is, 
according 
to 
our 
theory, 
1016±0.35 
GeV, 
very 
similar 
with 
the 
one 
obtained 
with 
String 
theory. 



151. 
Gravitational 
scale 
and 
GUT 
theory; 
Higgs 
bosons 
The 
Gravitational 
scale 
needs 
to 
be 
fairly 
close 
to 
the 
GUT 
theory. 
This 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
stability 
of 
matter. 
The 
String 
theory 
considers 
two 
mass 
scales 
in 
this 
matter: 


• 
The 
Planck 
mass: 
1.2 
x1019 
GeV 
(1019.08) 
and 
• 
The 
gravitational 
scale 
mgrav=k-1=2.4 
x1018 
GeV. 
This 
scale 
is 
obtained 
dividing 
Planck 
mass/√(8π); 
and 
its 
logarithmical 
(log10) 
value 
is 
18.38GeV. 
And 
so, 
its 
range 
would 
be 
1018.73±0.35 
GeV. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
confirm, 
accepting 
λp 
as 
the 
specific 
point 
(and 
the 
only 
one) 
where 
gravity 
meets 
with 
the 
other 
three 
forces. 
In 
that 
moment, 
with 
λp=1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm, 
it 
would 
have 
a 
mass 
of 
1.2 
x1019 
GeV; 
and 
acting 
gravitationally, 
a 
quadrupole 
exists. 
Each 
pole 
has 
the 
same 
mass 
equivalent 
to 
approximately 
2.4 
x1018 
GeV 
each. 
With 
leptons, 
the 
mass 
of 
their 
fields 
is 
divided 
by 
√(2π), 
where 
only 
one 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
exists. 
In 
quarks 
or 
quadrupole 
gravity, 
two 
pairs 
exists, 
2(+) 
and 
2(-), 
and 
so 
its 
division 
is 
by 
2√(2π) 
or 
√(8π). 
In 
both 
meeting 
points 
(and 
immediate 
separation), 
other 
Higgs 
bosons 
exist, 
which 
are 
additional 
to 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
(that 
is 
accessible 
to 
the 
power 
of 
the 
LHC 
or 
Large 
Hadron 
Collider). 
The 
other 
two, 
the 
Higgs 
strong 
boson 
and 
the 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson, 
are 
at 
energies 
that 
will 
be 
inaccessible 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
are 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
or 
access 
them, 
we 
would 
need 
to 
find 
and 
use 
natural 
cosmic 
colliders. 



152. 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
We 
don’t 
accept 
that 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter. 
For 
us, 
a 
big 
room 
for 
a 
heavier 
scale 
of 
particles 
exists; 
which 
have 
a 
similar 
symmetry, 
according 
to 
the 
appearance 
of 
known 
particles. 
Each 
heavy 
particle 
has 
a 
relation 
with 
its 
corresponding 
partner, 
similar 
among 
them, 
whose 
range 
is 
around 
1016, 
more 
or 
less 
1/√(λp). 
However 
the 
room 
for 
the 
superpartners 
is 
very 
small. 
If 
supersymmetry 
is 
the 
solution 
to 
the 
hierarchy 
problem, 
the 
cancellations 
of 
the 
quantum 
correction 
to 
the 
Higgs 
mass 
require 
that 
the 
separation 
between 
the 
Standard 
Model 
particles 
and 
their 
superpartners 
to 
be 
not 
much 
larger 
than: 
102 
GeV 
≤ 
msp 
≤ 
103 
GeV. 


To 
solve 
the 
Higgs 
naturalness 
problem, 
the 
masses 
of 
superpartners 
must 
be 
of 
the 
order 
of 
103 
GeV 
or 
less. 
Heavy 
partners 
don’t 
have 
that 
limit. 
Also, 
a 
renewed 
version 
of 
superpartners 
could 
use 
the 
same 
values. 
The 
important 
issue 
is 
to 
accept 
that 
Higgs 
bosons 
are 
not 
destroyed 
by 
heat. 



153. 
Information 
is 
never 
lost 
The 
black 
hole 
information 
paradox 
is 
a 
conflict 
between 
general 
relativity 
and 
quantum 
mechanics. 
When 
black 
hole 
evaporates, 
according 
to 
Hawking 
radiation, 
or 
when 
mass 
falls 
dawn 
to 
the 
“singularity” 
of 
the 
black 
hole, 
the 
information 
that 
fell 
into 
a 
black 
hole 
is 
lost 
and 
doesn't 
reappear. 
This 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
physical 
rules 
and 
with 
ordinary 
quantum 
mechanical 
evolution. 
Information 
is 
never 
lost. 
And 
in 
the 
interchange 
of 
matter 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
the 
same 
information 
returns 
to 
our 
Universe 
(increasing 
its 
mass). 
Besides 
that, 
even 
if 
this 
interchange 
doesn’t 
exist, 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information, 
with 
size 
λp, 
is 
never 
destroyed. 
String 
theory 
is 
clear: 
distance 
0 
or 
distances 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length 
don’t 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe. 
Mass, 
energy, 
and 
information 
are 
not 
destroyed 
in 
a 
black 
hole. 
In 
first 
place, 
the 
“singularity” 
at 
the 
center 
of 
black 
hole 
doesn’t 
exist. 
Like 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
a 
hole 
with 
length 
λp 
exists, 
which 
has 
contact 
with 
another 
hole 
with 
the 
same 
length 
(λp) 
in 
the 
opposite 
parallel 
Universe. 
If 
a 
singularity 
existed, 
lines 
pointing 
inward 
through 
the 
horizon 
represented 
bits 
of 
information 
falling 
past 
the 
horizon 
into 
the 
singularity 
and 
there 
were 
no 
lines 
coming 
back 
out. 
In 
this 
manner, 
those 
bits 
of 
information 
would 
be 
totally 
lost. 
Moreover, 
the 
mass, 
and 
in 
consequence 
the 
energy, 
would 
eventually 
evaporate 
and 
disappear 
through 
Hawking 
radiation, 
leaving 
no 
trace 
of 
what 
has 
fallen 
in. 
All 
this 
process, 
apparently 
true, 
is 
not 
correct, 
mainly 
because 
the 
singularity 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
hole 
doesn’t 
exist. 
The 
String 
theory 
needs 
to 
do 
for 
black 
holes 
what 
it 
did 
for 
the 
Big 
Bang: 
that 
there 
are 
no 
distances 
equal 
to 
zero, 
and 
neither 
sub-Planck 
distances 
in 
space. 
Second, 
even 
in 
existing 
transits 
to 
another 
Universe, 
the 
inward 
(bits 
and 
mass) 
line 
has 
a 
corresponding 
line 
that 
is 
creating 
an 
exactly 
inverse 
process, 
like 
we 
explained 
before. 
Third, 
even 
in 
existing 
Hawking 
radiation, 
this 
heat 
acts 
in 
the 
ergosphere, 
acting 
as 
catalyst 
to 
form 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs, 
separating 
them 
by 
the 
action 
of 
black 
holes. 
Although 
there 
is 
destruction 
among 
the 
antiparticles 
(that 
enter 
into 
a 
back 



hole) 
and 
a 
decreasing 
mass 
for 
matter 
that 
enters 
a 
black 
hole, 
there 
is 
no 
loss 
of 
mass 
or 
information 
because 
they 
(mass 
and 
information) 
are 
recovered 
in 
an 
inverse 
process 
(the 
interchange 
with 
the 
parallel 
Universe). 
Even 
if 
the 
interchange 
of 
matter-antimatter 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
is 
inexistent 
and 
a 
black 
hole 
eventually 
disappears, 
information 
will 
never 
be 
lost, 
because 
size 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist, 
and 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information: 
Planck 
area 
will 
always 
remain. 
This 
is 
a 
hole 
with 
λp 
length 
and 
it 
is 
indestructible, 
until 
the 
last 
event 
of 
our 
Universe. 
Explanations 
about 
this 
are 
in 
further 
sections 
in 
this 
book. 



154. 
Natural 
and 
artificial 
wormholes 
Albert 
Einstein 
and 
Nathan 
Rosen 
speculated 
that 
the 
interior 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
might 
connect 
to 
a 
very 
distance 
place, 
which 
John 
Wheeler 
later 
called 
a 
wormhole. 
This 
concept 
would 
need 
two 
black 
holes, 
which 
could 
be 
joined 
at 
their 
horizon 
forming 
a 
shortcut 
across 
our 
Universe. 
If 
the 
String 
theory 
would 
avoid 
the 
singularity 
by 
putting 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
at 
Planck 
length, 
we 
would 
obtain, 
by 
joining 
two 
holes, 
a 
wormhole 
to 
another 
Universe. 
This 
new 
Universe 
is 
gravitationally 
parallel 
to 
ours, 
and 
its 
in 
connection 
by 
means 
of 
CPT 
symmetry. 


Differently, 
to 
obtain 
a 
shortcut 
for 
traveling 
to 
a 
distant 
place 
of 
our 
Universe, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
tear 
the 
fabric 
of 
space, 
and 
this 
is 
only 
possible 
in 
a 
fractal 
spatial 
dimension 
between 
3 
and 
4, 
until 
we 
arrive 
to 
the 
fourth 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe. 
Our 
Universe 
will 
eventually 
arrive 
at 
that 
moment, 
more 
specifically 
at 
9.75 
x1021 
s 
after 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
In 
the 
actual 
moment, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
tear 
the 
fabric 
of 
space. 
Our 
technology 
is 
very 
rudimentary. 
Even 
in 
science 
fiction, 
the 
third 
law 
of 
motion 
(action-reaction 
propulsion) 
is 
still 
being 
normally 
used; 
we 
could 
possibly 
travel 
faster 
than 
light 
in 
our 
planet, 
return 
to 
the 
past; 
or 
travel 
between 
dimensions 
(even 
to 
a 
Universe 
of 
ten 
dimensions, 
nine 
+ 
one 
time), 
where 
the 
superpartners 
would, 
of 
course, 
exist. 
In 
the 
real 
world, 
this 
travel 
is 
possible, 
but 
not 
with 
our 
physical 
bodies, 
where 
matter 
has 
c 
as 
its 
speed 
limit. 
We 
need 
to 
learn 
to 
travel 
using 
immaterial 
bodies, 
like 
our 
mind 
(mental 
body) 
or 
our 
astral 
body, 
even 
if 
these 
terms 
seem 
esoteric 
and 
far 
from 
scientific. 
Since 
String 
theory 
accepts 
more 
dimensions 
than 
four 
(3 
+ 
1 
time), 
it 
opens 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
possibilities. 
If 
the 
physics 
community 
would 
try 
to 
find 
a 
lot 
of 
new 
ideas 
derived 
from 
the 
String 
theory, 
instead 
of 
trying 
to 
fix 
old 
ones, 
a 
renovated 
and 
vigorous 
String 
theory 
would 
appear 
and 
a 
new 
string 
revolution 
would 
be 
possible. 



155. 
Fundamental 
bit 
of 
information 
John 
Wheeler 
affirmed 
that 
all 
material 
objects 
are 
composed 
of 
bits 
of 
information. 
Moreover, 
a 
“fundamental 
bit” 
(with 
one 
bit 
of 
information) 
exists, 
which 
has 
the 
minimum 
size. 
According 
to 
String 
theory, 
the 
minimum 
size 
in 
our 
Universe 
is 
λp 
(Planck 
length). 
The 
information 
is 
dependent 
on 
its 
area 
(like 
the 
entropy 
of 
a 
black 
hole) 
and 
not 
on 
its 
volume. 
Planck 
length 
exists 
in 
any 
place 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
we 
could 
see 
it, 
if 
we 
use 
the 
energy 
necessary. 
In 
that 
way, 
our 
Universe 
can 
be 
divided 
into 
pieces 
of 
this 
fundamental 
bit. 
And 
so, 
any 
information 
(of 
any 
object 
in 
any 
Universe) 
is 
formed 
by 
copies 
(clones) 
of 
this 
fundamental 
bit. 
Because 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
decrease 
Planck 
length 
(even 
with 
the 
best 
technology 
available 
in 
any 
time 
of 
the 
future), 
this 
unity 
of 
information 
can’t 
be 
discarded. 
If 
that 
could 
be 
possible, 
our 
Universe 
would 
collapse. 


This 
fundamental 
bit 
(area=λp2=2.611391055 
x10-66 
cm2) 
will 
never 
be 
evaporated 
nor 
destroyed 
in 
any 
form 
during 
the 
life 
of 
our 
Universe. 


This 
miniature 
information 
package 
is 
the 
key 
of 
the 
chain. 
All 
the 
information 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
some 
kind 
of 
continuous 
repetition 
of 
this 
key, 
in 
different 
angles, 
ways, 
and 
forms; 
representing 
now, 
the 
variety 
of 
our 
Universe, 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
diverse 
repetition 
of 
the 
unity. 
This 
fundamental 
bit 
can't 
have 
all 
the 
information. 
It’s 
the 
repetition 
of 
the 
key 
that 
does, 
which 
forms 
different 
and 
numerous 
chains, 
which 
are 
the 
ones 
that 
do. 
Lastly, 
we 
insist 
that 
size 
0 
can't 
exist. 
Using 
it 
would 
produce 
infinities 
and 
singularities, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
absurdities. 


Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
Planck 
length 
is 
a 
hole, 
which 
is 
unbounded 
and 
impossible 
to 
divide 
or 
to 
reduce. 
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
we 
had 
one 
bit 
of 
information. 
This 
confirms 
that 
the 
entropy 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
was 
Ø 
(cozero 
or 
almost 
zero). 
The 
continuous 
increment 
of 
entropy 
(when 
a 
Universe 
is 
stretching 
or 
shrinking 
or 
in 
an 
intermediate 
Big 
Crush 
between 
Universes) 
is 
used 
to 
develop 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
A 
cyclical 
Universe 
is 
an 
impossibility 
without 
a 
dimensional 
change.

Big 
Bang, 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information. 
Prequarks 
The 
Big 
Bang 
was 
formed 
by 
only 
one 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information, 
attached 
to 
another 
bit 
of 
information 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe. 
This 
small 
size 
has 
had 
the 
basic 
information 
since 
the 
beginning 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
have 
it 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe. 
In 
effect, 
it 
had 
the 
four 
forces 
joined 
together, 
that 
will 
rule 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe; 
the 
fundamental 
constants: 
ℏ, 
c, 
G 
were 
fixed; 
the 
minimum 
length, 
and 
in 
consequence 
the 
maximum 
expansion 
of 
Universe, 
according 
to 
T-symmetry; 
the 
first 
Higgs 
field, 
with 
maximum 
energy 
(or 
mass); 
the 
maximum 
mass 
for 
a 
particle 
(or 
the 
fundamental 
string); 
the 
first 
Higgs 
boson; 
the 
mathematical 
relation 
for 
the 
new 
Higgs 
bosons; 
the 
expansion 
of 
Universe; 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
obtaining 
the 
mass 
of 
particles 
ℏ/cλ=m; 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
cosmic 
mass 
Rc2/G=m; 
the 
basic 
unit 
of 
entropy; 
the 
basic 
relation 
among 
particles 
(we 
don’t 
need 
to 
wait 
until 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
to 
appear, 
to 
give 
mass 
to 
each 
particle: 
The 
first 
mass 
for 
a 
particle 
is 
2.4x1018 
GeV, 
obtained 
by 
dividing 
Planck 
mass/√(8π), 
according 
to 
String 
theory. 
(Named 
gravitational 
scale; 
although 
it 
is 
a 
fundamental 
scale 
to 
particles). 
All 
the 
particle 
families 
are 
derived 
from 
this 
information. 
There 
are 
no 
different 
families 
of 
particles; 
(for 
most 
people, 
3 
or 
6), 
it 
is 
the 
same 
family, 
but 
with 
different 
manifestations; 
basically 
in 
their 
mass, 
depending 
on 
the 
λ 
involved. 
Even 
the 
four 
particles, 
which 
form 
a 
quadrupole 
in 
the 
first 
chronos, 
are 
heavy-
quarks, 
two 
positives 
and 
two 
negatives. 
The 
information 
used 
to 
form 
leptons 
is 
already 
programmed. 
In 
effect, 
if 
we 
used 
the 
prequarks 
theory 
(that 
we 
will 
explain 
later), 
we 
have 
4 
quarks 
detailed 
as: 



Using 
this 
sequence, 
we 
can 
obtain 
at 
least, 
informatically 
speaking, 
the 
four 



leptons: 
AAA, 
BBB, 
, 
KKK: 
positron, 
electron, 
neutrino, 
and 
antineutrino, 
in 
their 
heaviest 
variety. 
We 
know 
that 
the 
families 
are 
exactly 
equal 
and 
that 
their 
difference 
resides 
only 
in 
their 
mass. 
And 
that 
the 
mass 
of 
particles 
has 
the 
relation 
k=mλ. 
We 
know 
that 
all 
the 
numbers 
come 
from 
a 
unit. 
Big 
proteins 
come 
from 
small 
chains 
of 
amino 
acids; 
the 
genetic 
code, 
from 
the 
repetition 
of 
simpler 
units. 
The 
Universe 
comes 
from 
the 
fundamental 
unit 
of 
information, 
fixing 
the 
initial 
conditions 
and 
forming 
a 
colossal 
variety, 
using 
the 
different 
sequences 
of 
these 
units. 
This 
is 
only 
a 
schematic 
idea 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
better 
developed. 
If 
we 
could 
see 
the 
Universe 
in 
a 
logical 
manner 
and 
in 
a 
logical 
development, 
we 
could 
obtain 
simple 
answers 
to 
many 
concepts 
that 
we 
consider 
mysteries 
right 
now. 



157. 
Variety 
in 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
One 
of 
the 
big 
problems 
in 
particle 
physics 
is 
the 
question 
of 
why 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
vary 
without 
an 
apparent 
pattern. 
Notwithstanding, 
to 
obtain 
these 
masses 
a 
simple 
pattern 
fixed 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
exists, 
more 
specifically 
in 
the 
first 
level 
of 
information 
(The 
fundamental 
bit). 
In 
first 
place, 
the 
Universe 
has 
two 
limits: 
minimum 
and 
maximum, 
each 
with 
a 
finite 
value 
(The 
Universe 
would 
be 
infinite, 
only 
if 
the 
Big 
Bang 
was 
zero). 
We 
now 
know, 
according 
to 
String 
theory, 
and 
obtained 
by 
the 
relation 
of 
the 
fundamental 
constant 
λp=±√(Gℏ/c3) 
that 
its 
value 
is 
1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm 
(And 
in 
natural 
logarithms 
= 
-75.50536654). 
The 
maximum 
according 
to 
T-symmetry, 
in 
String 
theory, 
is 
R=α/R', 
where 
there 
would 
be 
a 
perfect 
reciprocal 
only 
if 
α=1. 
However 
a 
small 
asymmetry 
exists, 
where 
α 
has 
a 
value 
less 
than 
1, 
if 
R' 
is 
the 
minimum 
value 
and 
R 
is 
the 
maximum. 


According 
to 
the 
different 
ways 
of 
expansion, 
in 
Macroscopic 
objects 
(six 
ways 
instead 
of 
one), 
the 
correction 
factor 
is 
six 
times 
bigger 
in 
the 
maximum, 
like 
we 
explained 
before, 
-18/28 
instead 
of 
-3/28; 
α=e-18/28-3/28 
= 
e21/
28, 
α=e-0.75=0.472366552 
cm2. 
And 
so, 
we 
also 
have 
the 
maximum 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe: 
R=0.472366552/(1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm) 
x1 
cm2 
Where 
the 
maximum 
would 
be 
2.923096698 
x1032 
cm 
or 
2.923096699 
x1032 
cm. 
The 
particles 
are 
produced 
in 
microcosmos 
space 
using 
two 
scales: 
one, 
by 
using 
the 
maximum 
limit 
logarithmic 
factor, 
producing, 
basically, 
the 
known 
particles 
(-74.75536654/24=-3.114806939). 
Two, 
using 
the 
minimum 
limit 
in 
logarithmic 
value 
(-75.50536654/24=-3.146056939), 
would 
produce 
the 
supposed 
unknown 
particles, 
heavier 
than 
the 
others, 
by 
a 
factor 
of 
around 
1016. 
The 
way 
to 
utilize 
these 
factors 
was 
explained 
in 
former 
sections. 



158. 
Masses 
of 
particles; 
Uncertainty 
Principle 
We 
insist, 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
of 
matter 
have 
a 
perfect 
design 
and 
sequences, 
and 
it 
is 
basic 
to 
use 
the 
uncertainty 
principle: 
m=ℏ/cλ 
or 
mλ=k 
The 
masses 
of 
particles 
are 
ruled 
by 
quantum 
mechanics; 
and 
in 
that 
way 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
particles 
of 
matter 
with 
mass 
0 
to 
exist. 


Notwithstanding, 
the 
theory 
of 
Weinberg, 
Salam, 
and 
Glashow; 
which 
predicted 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
three 
bosons 
(W+, 
W-, 
Z0), 
requires 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
Higgs 
field, 
with 
which 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
is 
associated, 
in 
order 
to 
give 
mass 
to 
the 
three 
particles 
of 
forces. 
This 
is 
totally 
true. 
The 
insistence 
that 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
all 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
is 
a 
supposition 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
and 
this 
last 
supposition 
is 
wrong. 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
will 
appear 
at 
the 
LHC 
and 
nothing 
else 
will 
appear, 
except 
for 
a 
new 
class 
of 
heavy 
neutrino. 
Even 
some 
physicists 
consider 
the 
density 
of 
energy 
of 
LHC 
to 
be 
a 
big 
one, 
but 
it 
is 
only 
relatively 
big; 
and 
is 
almost 
negligible 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
density 
of 
energy 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
necessary 
to 
form 
black 
holes. 
Any 
black 
hole, 
with 
all 
sizes 
of 
its 
event 
horizon, 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
cosingularity 
in 
the 
center, 
of 
Planck 
length. 
LHC 
can 
find 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson<500 
GeV 
and 
this 
is 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
natural 
logarithmical 
scale, 
equivalent 
to 
e-37.75268327 
or 
4.02 
x10-17 
cm, 
which 
is 
only 
√(λp). 
A 
black 
hole 
can 
form 
it 
by 
gravitational 
collapse, 
using 
the 
gravitational 
force 
and 
the 
center 
would 
be 
derived 
from 
it; 
but 
colliding 
particles, 
using 
the 
electromagnetic 
force, 
need 
to 
form 
the 
center 
first, 
with 
energy 
around 
Planck 
mass 
=1.2 
x1019 
GeV. 
Maybe 
humanity 
will 
be 
able 
to 
develop 
the 
technology 
necessary 
to 
do 
this 
in 
a 
very 
distant 
future; 
only 
if 
it 
doesn't 
destroys 
itself 
before 
they 
can 
do 
it 
(produce 
black 
holes) 
Could 
it 
be 
done 
with 
the 
LHC? 
We 
don’t 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
it 
right 
now. 
LHC 
is 
a 
big 
collider 
for 
us; 
but 
in 
the 
way 
of 
technology, 
we 
are 
still 
in 
diapers. 



159. 
Age 
of 
our 
Universe 
and 
bits 
of 
information 
The 
scientific 
community 
considers 
the 
age 
of 
our 
Universe 
to 
be 
between 
13.7~15 
billion 
years. 
Few 
years 
ago, 
most 
physics 
books 
considered 
that 
it 
was 
15 
Gyr; 
but 
more 
recently, 
the 
same 
authors 
changed 
this 
number 
and 
now 
they 
use 
14 
Gyr, 
and 
sometimes, 
more 
specifically, 
13.7 
Gyr. 
If 
we 
obtain 
the 
light 
radius 
of 
the 
Universe 
(h=ct), 
it 
would 
be 
between 
1.2961x1028 
cm 
and 
1.4191 
x1028 
cm 
and 
their 
areas 
would 
be 
approximately 
1.6799 
x1056 
cm2 
and 
2.01385x1056 
cm2. 
The 
area 
of 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
would 
be 
λp=2.6114x10-66 
cm2. 
And 
so, 
our 
Universe 
in 
this 
moment 
would 
have 
around 
10121 
bits 
(units 
of 
information). 
Considering 
Λ 
as 
a 
variable, 
we 
can 
see 
that 
this 
is 
the 
same 
difference 
that 
exists 
between 
the 
theoretical 
quantum 
calculations 
of 
Λ 
(equivalent 
to 
its 
value 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang) 
and 
the 
experimental 
value 
in 
the 
actual 
moments. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
can 
affirm 
that 
with 
time, 
the 
Universe 
increases: 
its 
mass, 
its 
information, 
its 
entropy; 
and 
decreases: 
its 
temperature 
and 
its 
cosmological 
“constant”. 
Moreover, 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
units 
of 
information 
is 
inversely 
proportional 
(and 
mathematically 
exact) 
to 
the 
decreasing 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant”. 
Nevertheless, 
even 
if 
Λ 
decreases 
with 
time 
(Λ 
being 
a 
determinant 
factor 
of 
dark 
energy 
in 
its 
value 
the 
mass), 
the 
radius 
(ct) 
of 
the 
Universe 
also 
intervenes, 
whose 
value 
increases 
with 
time. 
In 
that 
way, 
dark 
energy 
also 
increases 
with 
time, 
even 
if 
Λ 
decreases. 
Notwithstanding, 
the 
gravitational 
energy 
and 
the 
dark 
energy, 
like 
potential 
energies, 
have 
negative 
values.

Prequarks 
forming 
leptons 
and 
quarks 
The 
Hadrons 
are 
formed 
by 
quarks. 
But 
quarks 
and 
leptons 
are 
considered 
fundamental 
structures. 
However, 
the 
possibility 
that 
quarks 
and 
leptons 
may 
in 
fact 
be 
themselves 
complex 
bodies 
exists, 
composed 
of 
smaller 
entities, 
that 
we 
call 
prequarks. 
However, 
there 
have 
been 
no 
successful 
experiments 
that 
confirm 
this 
position. 
It 
is 
highly 
probable, 
that 
we 
could 
never 
divide 
quarks 
or 
leptons; 
but 
using 
gravity, 
in 
highly 
sensitive 
experiments, 
pre–quarks 
could 
be 
detected 
inside 
leptons 
and 
quarks. 
We 
will 
try 
to 
write 
some 
theoretical 
concepts 
over 
this 
topic. 
The 
charges 
are: 
±1, 
±2/3, 
±1/3, 
0, 
if 
the 
base 
is 
3. 
But 
in 
the 
“real 
string”, 
in 
the 
first 
spatial 
dimensional 
world, 
their 
charges 
would 
be 
±1, 
0 
(in 
that 
Universe). 
Logically, 
If 
we 
adapt 
the 
charges 
to 
our 
world, 
charge 
1 
in 
the 
string 
Universe 
would 
be 
1/3 
in 
ours. 
Basically, 
the 
minimum 
components 
of 
charge 
are: 
Positive 
and 
its 
neutral. 
(A, 
K). 


Negative 
and 
its 
neutral. 
(B, 
). 
In 
brief, 
they 
are: 
A 
(positive); 
K 
(neutral 
A); 
B(negative); 
(neutral 
B). 


with 
1 
spatial 
dimension, 
the 
particles 
would 
be: 


In 
two 
spatial 
dimensions: 


(with 
2 
“colors” 
in 
quarks). 


In 
three 
spatial 
dimensions: 


InaUniverse

The 
3 
“colors” 
are 
possible 
only 
in 
quarks: 
AAK, 
AKA, 
KAA, 
and 



In 
leptons, 
“colors” 
don’t 
exist, 
because 
only 
a 
class 
of 
pre-quark 
exists. 
The 
first 
mesons 
are: 
(Pions) 



The 
pion 
(zero) 
is 
a 
50% 
-50% 
mixture 
of 
both. 




They 
are 
like 
different 
families; 
we 
can 
show 
their 
intensity 
by 
increasing 
the 
intensity 
of 
its 
letters, 
making 
them 
darker, 
so: 


✓ 
First 
family: 
electron: 
BBB 
✓ 
Second 
family: 
muon: 
BBB 
✓ 
Third 
family: 
tauon: 
BBB 


More 
intensity 
means 
more 
energy, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
more 
mass. 
Other 
different 
mesons 
and 
hadrons 
can 
be 
obtained 
by 
means 
of 
different 
combinations 
among 
them. 
The 
former 
examples 
are 
enough 
to 
show 
all 
the 
other 
possibilities. 
If 
we 
take 
the 
prequarks 
of 
the 
main 
particles, 
we 
obtain 
a 
total 
charge 
of 
0; 
Ex.: 
proton 
+ 
neutron 
+ 
electron 
+ 
neutrino 
=0 



With 
the 
antiparticles, 
we 
have 
the 
same 
thing: 
antiproton 
+ 
antineutron 
+ 
positron 
+ 
antineutrino 
=0. 



While 
prequarks 
cannot 
be 
showed 
experimentally, 
they 
would 
only 
be 
science 
fiction. 
But 
our 
“real” 
world 
is 
also 
an 
illusion, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
ours. 


We 
can 
show 
other 
possibilities 
using 
A, 
B, 
K, 
in 
different 
intensities 
and 
we 
can 
even 
form 
all 
the 
known 
structures 
or 
even 
new 
ones, 
in 
process 
to 
be 
obtained; 
and 
all 
are 
arithmetical 
exact. 
Using 
a 
simple 
perspective, 
the 
prequarks 
are 
“real” 
like 
our 
Universe. 
But 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
find 
the 
complex 
structure 
of 
quarks 
and 
leptons 
experimentally, 
and 
we 
need 
to 
use 
gravity 
to 
do 
it. 



161. 
Equations 
and 
combinations 
of 
prequarks 
The 
numbers 
of 
prequarks 
needs 
to 
be 
exactly 
equal 
in 
both 
sides 
of 
the 


equation. 
When 
the 
numbers 
are 
different, 
we 
can 
add 
pairs 
of 
energy: 
AB 
or 
K 
, 
which 
are 
equivalent 
to 
photons 
in 
order 
to 
equalize 
the 
equations; 
we 
can 
also 
change 
a 
group 
into 
the 
other. 


Examples: 



Or, 
to 
change 
K 
to 
AB: 



The 
β 
decays 
of 
a 
neutron 
into 
a 
proton, 
electron, 
and 
antineutrino 
(according 
to 
the 
lepton 
classification 
scheme, 
indicates 
that 
this 
is 
an 
“antiparticle”, 
even 
if 
others 
nominations 
call 
it 
“neutrino”. 



Using 
the 
prequark 
scheme, 
we 
see 
an 
antiparticle 
that 
accompanies 
the 
prequarks 
B 
(B, 
), 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
antimatter. 
BBB 
forms 
the 
electron 
(a 
particle). 



162. 
Prequarks 
and 
different 
dimensions 
We 
talked 
about 
prequarks: 
A, 
B, 
K, 
from 
the 
normal 
world 
of 
a 
string, 
2 
dimensions 
(1+1). 
A 
similar 
theory 
was 
pursued 
in 
the 
1970s. 
The 
more 
fundamental 
particles 
were 
named 
preons; 
this 
explained 
some 
of 
natural 
features 
unexplained 
in 
the 
Standard 
Model. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
preon 
theory, 
at 
least 
at 
that 
moment, 
didn’t 
explain 
a 
fundamental 
question; 
and 
inexplicably, 
instead 
of 
finding 
the 
answer, 
the 
theory 
was 
discarded 
in 
1980. 
The 
question 
was: 


What 
kind 
of 
force 
must 
bind 
the 
preons 
together 
into 
the 
observed 
particles? 


The 
answer 
has 
relation 
with 
the 
spatial 
dimensions 
of 
our 
Universe. 
The 
Universes 
began 
with 
zero 
spatial 
dimensions 
(0+1) 
and 
in 
that 
moment, 
no 
particles 
were 
formed 
and 
the 
two 
preons 
(or 
the 
4 
prequarks) 
didn’t 
exist. 
That 
Universe 
had 
a 
minimum 
and 
a 
maximum 
limit, 
but 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
divide 
it 
into 
particles. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
represent 
a 
“virtual 
space”, 
with 
divided 
space, 
but 
this 
would 
be 
a 
hypothetical 
division, 
with 
no 
real 
existence. 
In 
the 
natural 
world 
of 
strings 
(1+1), 
the 
preons 
or 
prequarks, 
appeared 
and 
they 
could 
never 
combine 
to 
form 
more 
complex 
particles. 
A 
Universe 
(1+1) 
has 
“particles” 
with 
one 
spatial 
dimension, 
with 
a 
string 
alone, 
in 
four 


different 
presentations: 
and 
a 
charge, 
in 
relation 
to 
our 
Universe: 
+1/3, 
-1/3, 
and 
0. 
A 
Universe 
with 
3(2+1) 
dimensions 
has 
“membranes” 
with 
two 
spatial 


dimensions;withtwostringsjoinedtogether,indifferentcompositions:
andatypeof“proton”:“antiproton”:;and“neutron”thatitisitsownantiparticle.
Our 
Universe 
(3+1) 
has 
particles 
with 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
its 
fundamental 
unit 
is 
a 
particle 
with 
3 
prequarks 
(1x3), 
and 
their 
composites 
form 
2x3 
(mesons) 
or 
3x3 
(hadrons), 
like 
neutrons 
and 
protons. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
have 
real 
strings 
in 
our 
world, 
because 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 



have 
matter 
or 
particles 
with 
only 
one 
spatial 
dimension; 
for 
that 
reason, 
the 
dimensions 
of 
strings 
are 
2, 
10, 
and 
26 
(in 
space-time), 
never 
4. 
Remember, 
in 
our 
physical 
world, 
only 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
can 
exist 
(not 
4, 
2, 
nor 
1). 
That 
is 
the 
reality. 



163. 
D'branes 
in 
String 
Theory. 
Ekpyrotic 
model 
of 
the 
Universe 
Even 
now, 
there 
are 
some 
physicists 
that 
are 
not 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
development 
of 
D’branes 
in 
String 
theory. 
It 
is 
a 
very 
special 
issue 
that 
it 
is 
important 
to 
consider. 
Sundrum, 
Randall, 
Johnson, 
Steinhardt, 
and 
Turok 
have 
important 
references 
to 
its 
study 
and 
application. 
One 
of 
the 
more 
important 
scientific 
study 
over 
its 
technological 
application 
have 
been 
the 
“Ekpyrotic” 
model 
about 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
Universe, 
in 
which 
it 
is 
proposed 
that 
the 
Big 
Bang 
arose 
from 
the 
collision 
of 
two 
D–Branes 
in 
a 
previous 
phase 
of 
the 
Universe, 
although 
it 
doesn’t 
explain 
which, 
were, 
and 
why 
the 
original 
conditions 
of 
the 
beginning 
of 
our 
Universe, 
specially 
its 
very 
low 
entropy. 
The 
important 
affirmation 
is 
that 
before 
our 
Big 
Bang, 
there 
was 
a 
collision, 
which 
means 
a 
very 
chaotic 
stage, 
of 
destruction 
and 
high 
increase 
in 
entropy, 
in 
an 
accelerated 
contraction 
phase 
(Big 
Crush). 
We 
explained 
before, 
our 
Universe 
has 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
so, 
“our” 
Dbranes 
(D-3-branes) 
would 
be 
3+1 
dimensions. 
According 
to 
this, 
the 
collision 
of 
D-branes, 
before 
our 
Big 
Bang, 
is 
explained. 
It 
needed 
to 
be 
two 
D 
-2 
branes, 
and 
so, 
the 
increase 
to 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension, 
resolves 
the 
“disappearance” 
of 
the 
entropy. 
It 
was 
transformed 
into 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension, 
and 
its 
energy 
was 
needed 
to 
form 
it. 
If 
matter 
is 
a 
“storehouse 
of 
energy” 
according 
to 
E=mc2; 
a 
spatial 
dimension 
is 
a 
much 
bigger 
storehouse. 
The 
extraordinary 
“specialness” 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
that 
it 
must 
have 
necessary 
low 
entropy, 
is 
true, 
after 
forming 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
Moreover 
the 
thermal 
state, 
considering 
the 
thermal 
equilibrium 
of 
matter 
in 
the 
early 
Universe, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Universe’s 
fast 
expansion, 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
high-entropy 
state 
(thermal 
state), 
but 
this 
is 
not 
correct. 
The 
smallness 
of 
Big 
Bang 
had 
a 
big 
matter 
density 
(or 
energy 
density), 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
was 
a 
minimum 
mass 
or 
energy, 
considered 
in 
cosmic 
terms, 
leads 
to 
a 
basic 
concept 
of 
any 
black 
hole: 
less 
mass 
– 
higher 
temperature 
– 
less 
entropy. 
And: 
more 
mass 
-less 
temperature 
-more 
entropy. 
We 
considered 
the 
Big 
Bang 
as 
a 
black 
hole 
united 
to 
another, 
in 
our 
gravitational 
parallel 
Universe, 
with 
2λp 
as 
distance, 
λp 
in 
each 
Universe. 



164. 
Nature's 
efficiency 
Nature 
prefers 
economy 
and 
efficiency 
in 
its 
creation 
and 
always 
seems 
to 
avoid 
unnecessary 
redundancies 
in 
creating 
physical, 
chemical, 
cosmic, 
or 
biological 
structures. 
Nature 
uses 
simple 
formulas 
and 
derives 
from 
them, 
more 
than 
an 
enormous 
variety, 
a 
cofinite 
one. 
It 
uses 
simple 
mathematical 
representations 
of 
the 
different 
symmetry 
laws. 
It 
repeats 
a 
fundamental 
chain 
or 
a 
simple 
bit 
of 
information, 
using 
different 
angles, 
number 
of 
repetitions, 
or 
different 
forms, 
as 
a 
reference 
in 
order 
to 
form 
complex 
structures 
of 
different 
and 
unimaginable 
forms. 
This 
is 
practically 
an 
essential 
law 
of 
nature. 
If 
the 
scientific 
community 
considers 
an 
inefficient 
and 
uneconomical 
natural 
work, 
it 
does 
not 
have 
the 
complete 
knowledge 
of 
it. 
In 
those 
cases, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
go 
deeper 
inside 
the 
concept 
in 
order 
to 
find 
the 
complete 
truth. 
For 
example, 
the 
existence 
of 
3 
families 
(at 
least, 
only 
of 
the 
known 
particles) 
is 
considered 
a 
violation 
to 
this 
rule; 
but 
this 
is 
a 
partial 
point 
of 
view. 
Above 
all, 
only 
one 
family 
is 
necessary 
in 
our 
physical 
world. 
The 
repetition 
of 
the 
same 
units 
using 
different 
orders, 
is 
a 
natural 
privilege; 
using 
the 
economy 
and 
efficiency, 
to 
produce 
different 
effects, 
with 
the 
same 
rule 
and 
the 
same 
“pieces”. 
When 
nature 
creates 
animals, 
ADN, 
black 
holes 
or 
any 
kind 
of 
“things”, 
it 
is 
sparing 
in 
its 
design. 
Even 
when 
producing 
different 
families 
of 
particles. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
family, 
only 
changing 
in 
its 
mass, 
according 
to 
its 
formula: 
ℏ/cλ=m, 
derived 
from 
the 
uncertainty 
principle: 
ℏ=mcλ. 
We 
can 
obtain 
photocopies, 
smaller 
or 
larger 
or 
the 
same 
size, 
but 
always, 
a 
copy. 
In 
any 
case, 
the 
fundamental 
change 
is 
in 
its 
λ. 
Those 
λ 
are 
obtained 
in 
a 
Higgs 
sequence 
that 
we 
explained 
before. 
ℏ/c 
is 
a 
constant; 
and 
so, 
the 
different 
masses 
are 
obtained. 
We 
must 
remember: 
Higgs 
space 
is 
a 
abstract 
space, 
whose 
limits 
are 
between 
Planck 
length 
and 
approximately 
1 
cm 
(0.687289278 
cm), 
and 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Microcosmos, 
coincided 
with 
the 
light 
radius 
of 
the 
Universe 
(h=ct). 
Besides 
that, 
the 
infinitesimal 
period 
of 
time 
(microcosmos 
era) 
can 
make 
you 
think 
on 
the 
why 
of 
the 
need 
for 
a 
lot 
of 
families 
in 
a 
very 
brief 
period 
of 
time 
(2.292550264 
x10-11 
s)? 
But 
this 
is 
a 
very 
long 
time, 
practically 
all 
the 



microcosmos 
era, 
where 
its 
space 
is 
exactly 
equal 
to 
all 
of 
the 
macrocosmos, 
with 
the 
whole 
development 
of 
our 
Universe 
until 
now, 
and 
including 
the 
remaining 
space 
in 
the 
future 
development 
of 
the 
Universe, 
until 
its 
end. 
Of 
course, 
logarithmically 
speaking, 
that 
is 
the 
natural 
measure 
of 
time 
and 
space. 


In 
that 
way, 
to 
find 
other 
families, 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale, 
that 
is 
still 
almost 
unknown, 
using 
the 
same 
rule 
is 
not 
more 
complex, 
but 
it 
is 
only 
the 
same 
family 
in 
other 
presentations, 
new 
and 
identical 
carbon 
copies. 
We 
said 
“the 
heavier 
scale 
to 
be 
“almost 
unknown”, 
because 
the 
top 
quark; 
its 
small 
companion, 
the 
bottom 
quark, 
both 
in 
matter 
and 
antimatter 
variety, 
W± 
,Z0, 
and 
even, 
the 
next 
to 
be 
discovered, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
use 
this 
scale, 
according 
to 
the 
hook 
system 
that 
it 
transfers 
from 
a 
scale 
to 
another; 
normally 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a 
scale 
and 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
other, 
common 
in 
the 
Universe. 
We 
explained 
this 
before 
in 
this 
book. 



165.Aether
“Nature 
abhors 
vacuum”. 
This 
is 
a 
basic 
principle, 
but 
there 
is 
another 
principle 
called 
Occam’s 
razor, 
which 
establishes 
that 
nature 
takes 
the 
simplest 
possible 
path 
and 
ignores 
more 
difficult 
alternatives, 
especially 
if 
these 
alternatives 
can 
never 
be 
completed. 
In 
that 
way, 
Occam’s 
razor 
dismissed 
the 
old 
aether 
theory 
that 
pervades 
all 
space, 
including 
the 
“vacuum”. 
Einstein 
showed 
that 
aether 
was 
unnecessary. 
But 
he 
never 
said 
that 
aether 
doesn’t 
exist. 
He 
showed 
that 
it 
is 
irrelevant 
in 
our 
physical 
reality; 
although 
Planck 
length 
is 
the 
minimum 
length, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
shrink 
it 
or 
to 
reduce 
it; 
it 
is 
only 
real, 
in 
our 
dimensional 
Universe 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
(1.61597996 
x10-33 
cm.). 


Between 
3 
and 
4 
spatial 
dimensions, 
it 
exists 
a 
lot 
of 
shorter 
lengths 
until 
the 
4th 
spatial 
dimension 
is 
reached 
(1.896333025 
x10-44 
cm.), 
with 
a 
difference 
equivalent 
to 
8.52x1010 
between 
the 
two 
of 
them. 
This 
space 
is 
not 
completely 
empty, 
and 
constitutes 
the 
“foamy” 
state 
that 
John 
Wheeler 
named 
to 
the 
sub-Planck 
distance. 
This 
“element” 
is 
much 
lighter 
than 
“our" 
light, 
the 
maximum 
speed 
limit 
in 
our 
Universe. 



“Our” 
light 
is 
the 
frontier, 
traveling 
in 
our 
Universe 
as 
a 
wave 
or 
particles; 
but 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
at 
rest 
in 
a 
four 
spatial 
dimension 
Universe. 
Light 
would 
be 
as 
a 
static 
object. 
The 
light 
of 
the 
four-spatial 
dimension 
would 
be 
approximately, 
with 
the 
comparison 
of 
space, 
4.99x 
1010 
times 
faster. 
This 
“foam” 
is 
basically 
the 
“esoteric” 
aether 
or 
the 
“old 
physics" 
aether, 
existent 
in 
the 
fractal 
dimension, 
between 
Universes 
with 
different 
dimensionalities. 
Aether 
is 
irrelevant 
and 
practically 
inexistent 
in 
our 
physical 
world; 
for 
this 
reason, 
it 
has 
no 
influence 
in 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
But 
it 
exists, 
as 
a 
convenient 
medium 
in 
fractal 
dimension 
Universes; 
physically 
in 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
Big 
Crush; 
and 
also 
in 
the 
life 
of 
any 
Universe, 
filling 
virtually 
(with 
no 
physical 
reality) 
the 
area 
inside 
the 
corresponding 
holes 
of 
Planck. 
The 
aether 
theory 
provided 
a 
convenient 
answer 
to 
a 
difficult 
question: 
if 
light 
is 
a 
wave, 
and 
light 
travels 
in 
a 
vacuum, 
what 
is 
actually 
waving? 
However, 
Occam’s 
razor 
made 
physicists 
stop 
referring 
to 
aether. 
But 
String 
theory 
speaks 
of 
more 
spatial 
dimensions 
than 
3, 
and 
so, 
aether 
needs 
to 
be 
re-discovered, 
but 
farther 
away 
from 
our 
physical 
world 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions. 



166. 
Separation 
of 
Theory 
of 
Relativity 
and 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
The 
appearance 
of 
a 
single 
graviton 
is 
enough 
to 
collapse 
the 
wave 
function. 
The 
quantum 
wave, 
as 
an 
incoherent 
wave, 
produces 
different 
configurations, 
present 
in 
the 
particles’ 
world 
of 
microscopic 
level. 
But 
once 
these 
configurations 
have 
become 
magnified, 
or 
increased 
their 
masses 
to 
a 
certain 
critical 
point, 
they 
produce 
real 
gravitons, 
known 
as 
gravitational 
waves. 
At 
this 
moment, 
the 
quantum 
wave 
function 
collapses. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
quantum 
waves 
become 
virtual 
and 
the 
gravitational 
waves 
occupy 
the 
place 
of 
real 
existence. 
The 
paradox 
of 
measure 
is 
basically 
a 
mass 
measure. 
Above, 
is 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
simple 
quantum 
of 
space-time 
curvature 
that 
is 
sufficient 
to 
produce 
enough 
curvature 
in 
space-time 
to 
collapse 
the 
wave 
function 
(probabilistic 
wave) 
and 
produces 
a 
definitive 
result. 
The 
mass 
known 
is 
the 
key 
to 
resolve 
the 
quantum 
measurement 
problem. 
Below 
this 
measure, 
gravitation 
is 
not 
real, 
and 
the 
wave 
function, 
quantum 
or 
probabilistic, 
quantum 
or 
incoherent 
wave 
acts 
with 
all 
its 
strength. 
The 
measure 
is 
between 
Planck 
mass 
(field 
2.17x10-5 
g), 
and 
the 
gravitational 
scale, 
or 
mass 
of 
each 
pole 
of 
the 
gravitational 
quadrupole 
(4.32x10-6 
g), 
and 
has 
influence, 
although 
diminished, 
until 
roughly 
about 
10-7 
g. 
Quantum 
gravity 
is 
exact 
only 
in 
this 
period 
of 
time, 
the 
frontier 
between 
both 
waves. 
Later, 
both 
theories, 
General 
Theory 
of 
Relativity 
and 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
need 
to 
be 
separated. 
These 
concepts 
were 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections, 
from 
other 
standpoints. 



167. 
Information 
in 
String 
Theory 
that 
need 
to 
be 
rescued 
Superstring 
theories 
are 
formulated 
in 
a 
flat 
ten-dimensional 
space, 
like 
a 
ten–dimensional 
Minkowski 
space-time. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
theory 
describes 
particles 
and 
fields 
in 
a 
four-dimensional 
space-time. 
In 
that 
way, 
uses 
the 
terms 
M10 
and 
M4. 
The 
flat 
space 
is 
derived 
to 
a 
general 
curved 
space-time, 
which 
would 
emerge 
naturally 
out 
of 
the 
same 
theory. 
Besides 
that, 
M10 
must 
compactify 
into 
K6 
(six-dimensional 
compactified 
space), 
whose 
size 
of 
the 
dimensions 
of 
K 
must 
be 
too 
small, 
even 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
elementary 
particle 
level. 
The 
original 
flat 
ten-dimensional 
space-time, 
M10, 
is 
broken 
down 
into 
four 
flat 
dimensional 
and 
six-dimensional 
torus. 
This 
idea 
can 
be 
extended 
to 
an 
orbifold 
space, 
with 
3 
three 
special 
“singular” 
points, 
and 
to 
combine 
orbifolds 
to 
form 
more 
“singular” 
points 
(in 
superstring 
theory, 
a 
six-
dimensional 
compactified 
space 
with 
27 
special 
points 
is 
obtained). 
It 
turns 
out, 
the 
orbifold 
predicts 
36 
generations 
of 
elementary 
particles. 
Too 
many, 
but 
some 
are 
known 
particles. 
Generally, 
it 
uses 
0(32). 
In 
addition, 
the 
E8 
x 
E8 
symmetry, 
known 
as 
heterotic 
String 
theory, 
seems 
to 
act 
a 
little 
better. 
One 
of 
the 
E8 
groups 
breaks 
into 
SU(3) 
and 
E(6). 
E(6) 
breaks 
into 
an 
even 
finer 
structure. 
Those 
Superstring 
and 
String 
theories 
don’t 
need 
to 
be 
cancelled 
only 
because 
the 
superpartners 
don’t 
appear. 
These 
theories 
deserve 
to 
be 
improved. 


First: 
There 
is 
a 
lot 
of 
good 
information 
in 
superstring 
theory 
that 
is 
necessary 
to 
be 
saved. 
In 
first 
place, 
it 
considers 
a 
multidimensional 
space, 
more 
than 
our 
four-dimensional 
space–time. 
String 
theory 
considers 
10 
dimensions 
(9 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time) 
or 
10: 
(8)+2 
and 
26:(8)(8,8)+2. 
Second: 
There 
exists 
a 
minimum 
size, 
the 
smallest 
possible, 
but 
it 
is 
never 
zero 
(Planck 
length). 
Third: 
At 
the 
beginning, 
in 
a 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
the 
dimensions 
are 
flat. 
Fourth: 
The 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
(when 
space 
is 
flat) 
is 
massless. 
Fifth: 
Immediately 
after 
that, 
a 
general 
curved 
space-time 
emerged 
naturally, 
with 
mass, 
movement, 
and 
all 
the 
derived 
functions. 



Sixth: 
There 
exists 
the 
possibility 
of 
more 
than 
three 
generations 
(families) 
of 
elementary 
particles. 
Seventh: 
the 
dimension 
of 
strings 
are 
10 
and 
26, 
and 
according 
to 
the 
world 
sheet 
of 
string 
itself, 
is 
a 
two-dimensional 
object; 
and 
so, 
the 
dimensions 
of 
strings 
are 
also 
two. 
For 
us, 
the 
first 
is 
true. 
A 
multidimensional 
Universe 
exists. 
But 
a 
dimensional 
modulus 
has 
8 
dimensions 
(7 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
1 
time 
dimension). 
However, 
there 
exist 
28 
dimensional 
components 
to 
add 
all 
the 
involved 
spatial 
dimensions: 
0 
+ 
1 
+ 
2 
+ 
3 
+ 
4 
+ 
5 
+ 
6 
+ 
7 
=28. 
The 
first 
sequences 
in 
the 
dimension 
of 
string 
are 
2, 
10, 
26, 
… 
Second: 
it 
is 
true. 
All 
the 
components 
of 
any 
dimension 
have 
the 
same 
footing, 
but 
have 
different 
size 
with 
the 
others 
components 
of 
other 
dimensions. 
Planck 
length 
(λp) 
is 
only 
the 
size 
of 
the 
three 
components 
of 
our 
three-spatial 
Universe. 
The 
others 
dimensions 
have 
different 
footing. 
Third: 
Correct. 
We 
explained 
before 
the 
flat 
condition 
of 
our 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
This 
is 
completely 
flat. 
We 
are 
not 
speaking 
about 
our 
Universe 
in 
expansion 
that 
will 
never 
be 
flat, 
only 
almost 
flat. 
Fourth: 
Correct. 
No 
mass 
existed 
in 
the 
flat 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario; 
but 
neither 
did 
particles. 
Fifth: 
From 
the 
first 
chronos 
and 
on, 
curved 
space-time 
began 
to 
exist, 
exactly 
round. 
With 
the 
corresponding 
spatial 
form: 
(1) 
circumference, 
(2) 
circle, 
(3) 
sphere, 
and 
later 
in 
the 
next 
Universes, 
there 
will 
exist: 
4-sphere, 
5sphere, 
6-sphere 
and 
7-sphere. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
since 
the 
first 
chronos, 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c, 
appeared. 
And 
mass 
and 
space, 
began 
their 
relation 
by 
mean 
of 
two 
different 
formulas 
k=λM 
and 
k1=M/R. 
Sixth: 
For 
us, 
in 
our 
Universe, 
there 
are 
6 
generations 
(families) 
of 
particles, 
three 
in 
the 
known 
lighter 
scale 
and 
three 
in 
the 
almost 
unknown 
heavier 
scale. 
All 
the 
families 
are 
derived 
from 
only 
one 
family, 
like 
photocopies, 
smaller 
or 
larger, 
according 
to 
their 
sizes 
and 
in 
consequence, 
their 
masses. 
Seventh: 
Correct. 
The 
dimensions 
of 
string 
are 
2, 
10, 
26, 
… 


We 
explained 
before, 
there 
is 
a 
contradiction 
in 
the 
breakdown 
of 
an 
original 
Universe 
of 
10 
dimensions. 
In 
first 
place, 
each 
dimensional 
modulus 
has 
8 
dimensions 
(7+1) 
instead 
of 
10; 
and 
it 
is 
a 
fundamental 
dimensional 
unit, 
as 
a 
virtual 
entity, 
as 
abstract 
space. 
And 
for 
that, 
it 
never 
disappears 
even 
if 
a 
new 
dimensional 
Universe 
is 
developed. 
This 
modulus 
contains 
the 
smallest 



limits 
possible 
in 
each 
component. 
Besides 
that, 
it 
exists 
another 
virtual 
entity 
that 
contains 
the 
largest 
limits 
possible, 
inversely 
proportional 
(smaller 
minimum 
length, 
larger 
maximum 
length, 
and 
vice 
versa). 
We 
explained 
these 
concepts 
in 
more 
detail 
in 
former 
sections. 
Right 
now, 
we 
are 
comparing 
them 
with 
the 
Superstring 
and 
the 
String 
theories, 
and 
clarifying 
some 
concepts. 



168. 
Compactified 
space 
in 
String 
Theory 
We 
know 
that 
in 
String 
theory 
there 
exists 
a 
compactified 
space. 
It 
turns 
out 
that 
the 
smaller 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
compactified 
space, 
the 
larger 
the 
spacing 
between 
the 
notes 
on 
the 
mass 
scale. 
Using 
quantum 
mechanics 
we 
can 
say 
the 
same 
thing 
with 
different 
words: 
the 
smaller 
the 
wave’s 
length, 
the 
larger 
the 
masses 
in 
compactified 
space. 
In 
distances 
closer 
to 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
masses 
correspond 
to 
energies 
from 
1.64 
x1013 
GeV 
(heavy 
electron 
Higgs 
k-20π) 
to 
2.4x1018 
GeV 
(heavy 
top 
quark, 
maximum 
mass 
of 
a 
particle, 
or 
mass 
of 
each 
pole, 
in 
the 
quadruple, 
existing 
in 
Higgs 
k-24π). 
Those 
masses 
are 
much 
farther 
away 
from 
the 
power 
of 
the 
present 
colliders, 
including 
the 
LHC, 
that 
it 
can 
detect 
particles 
of 
no 
more 
than 
103 
GeV. 
Particles 
with 
colossal 
masses, 
could 
only 
have 
existed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe 
(chronos 
5.4x10-44 
s) 
until 
1.5x10-38 
s, 
in 
light 
time 
(h=ct); 
and 
they 
would 
also 
appear, 
when 
humanity 
has 
the 
technology 
to 
reach 
that 
power, 
or 
the 
knowledge 
to 
find 
natural 
colliders, 
with 
enormous 
power. 
We 
insist, 
a 
heavier 
scale 
needs 
to 
exist, 
and 
the 
fabulous 
Standard 
Model, 
fails 
to 
theoretically 
calculate 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
particles, 
and 
in 
consequence 
cannot 
suppose 
the 
existence 
of 
masses 
that 
are 
impossible 
to 
test, 
at 
least 
right 
now; 
too 
heavy, 
like 
the 
particles 
of 
heavy 
scale, 
or 
too 
light, 
like 
neutrinos 
1, 
2, 
and 
3. 
In 
former 
sections, 
we 
explained 
that 
there 
exist 
two 
scales. 
The 
known 
particles 
have 
lighter 
masses, 
enormously 
smaller 
than 
the 
Planck 
mass 
of 
1019 
GeV. 
This 
is 
one 
of 
the 
great 
questions 
of 
modern 
physics. 
And 
the 
proposed 
solution, 
we 
insist, 
is 
unacceptable 
and 
incorrect: 
it 
is 
an 
error 
to 
affirm 
that 
all 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
are 
massless 
and 
existed 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe; 
and 
to 
suppose 
they 
obtained 
their 
masses 
at 
around 
the 
point 
that 
the 
electroweak 
interaction 
breaks 
down, 
and 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
our 
“creator” 
appeared, 
giving 
mass 
to 
all 
the 
particles 
of 
matter. 
We 
accept 
that 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
only 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
force, 
the 
intermediate 
vector 
bosons, 
W+, 
W-, 
and 
Z0. 
Besides 
that, 
using 
logarithmical 
measures, 
the 
colossal 
difference 
among 
the 
masses, 
or 
better, 
among 
the 
λs 
of 
the 
fields 
of 
particles, 
and 
between 
time 
in 
the 
Macrocosmos 
and 
Microcosmos, 
is 
reduced 
or 
disappears 
completely. 
In 
order 
to 
use 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
correctly, 
we 
modified 
it 
like 
we 



explained 
in 
former 
sections. 
The 
system 
of 
the 
String 
theory 
that 
begins 
with 
the 
lowest 
note 
and 
has 
only 
massless 
particles 
that 
remain 
massless 
until 
the 
appearance 
of 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
incorrect. 



169. 
Vacuum 
with 
limits 
and 
without 
them. 
Limit 
of 
our 
Universe 
If 
the 
Universe 
is 
expanding, 
what’s 
it 
expanding 
to? 
The 
answer 
for 
some 
scientists 
is: 
nothing, 
because 
it’s 
the 
Universe, 
and 
for 
that 
reason 
it 
doesn’t 
have 
to 
be 
embedded 
onto 
anything 
else. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
think 
in 
the 
“outside” 
of 
the 
Universe. 
For 
us, 
this 
answer 
needs 
clarification. 
We 
know 
a 
minimum 
limit 
exists 
in 
any 
Universe 
(in 
our 
Universe 
it 
is 
λ≅1.616 
x10-33 
cm), 
and 
according 
to 
T-symmetry, 
there 
exists 
a 
maximum 
limit 
(λm 
≅ 
2.9231x1032 
cm), 
approximately 
its 
inverse. 
The 
Universe 
is 
expanding 
to 
reach 
this 
maximum 
limit, 
and 
outside 
the 
Universe, 
the 
virtual 
space 
necessary 
to 
do 
it, 
exists. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
horizon 
of 
success 
(h) 
is 
expanding, 
according 
to 
the 
limit 
of 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
h=ct; 
but 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
expanding 
in 
an 
accelerated 
way. 
If 
h 
is 
now 
between 
13.7 
to 
15 
Gyr; 
the 
cosmic 
radius 
is 
stretching 
between 
21 
to 
22 
Gyr, 
and 
even 
most 
cosmologists 
consider 
it 
stretched 
from 
42 
to 
44 
Gyr. 
Space 
is 
the 
fundamental 
unit 
of 
the 
Universe; 
and 
in 
the 
physical 
world, 
independent 
of 
how 
many 
spatial 
dimensions 
it 
has, 
it 
is 
always 
conditioned 
and 
limited; 
even 
the 
vacuum. 
In 
physical 
terms 
there 
only 
exists 
a 
vacuum 
with 
limits; 
always 
including 
one 
temporal 
dimension. 
Vacuum 
without 
limits, 
means 
no 
time 
dimensions; 
and 
with 
0 
or 
∞ 
spatial 
dimensions. 
This 
entity 
has 
no 
physical 
reality, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
is 
outside 
of 
any 
physical 
Universe, 
including 
a 
Universe 
with 
cofinite 
dimensions. 
For 
that 
reason, 
speaking 
about 
infinities 
or 
singularities, 
forming 
part 
in 
any 
physical 
world, 
is 
an 
absurdity, 
and 
so, 
unacceptable. 



170. 
Early 
Universe. 
Dark 
matter 
The 
early 
Universe 
was 
opaque, 
it 
was 
hot 
enough 
that 
electrons 
could 
not 
stay 
around 
atomic 
nuclei, 
but 
flew 
freely 
in 
the 
space. 
But 
temperature 
cooled 
down, 
and 
began 
the 
recombination 
process, 
and 
atoms 
where 
formed, 
and 
photons 
began 
to 
travel 
alone, 
380,000 
years 
after 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
At 
that 
moment, 
the 
Universe 
was 
transparent; 
the 
light 
traveled 
unimpeded 
from 
then 
on. 
The 
hot 
radiation, 
from 
that 
period 
has 
been 
stretched 
into 
microwaves 
of 
about 
1 
cm 
in 
wavelength, 
reaching 
a 
temperature 
of 
2.7K. 
This 
microwave 
radiation 
destroyed 
the 
last 
possibility 
of 
the 
Steady 
state 
theory. 
In 
which 
the 
temperature 
of 
Universe 
would 
be 
constant 
through 
time. 
This 
microwave 
radiation 
showed 
this 
principle 
is 
not 
true. 
However, 
the 
other 
condition, 
of 
the 
Steady 
State 
theory, 
that 
new 
matter 
is 
continually 
created, 
could 
be 
only 
partially 
incorrect. 
This 
theory 
considered 
the 
new 
matter 
was 
aggregated; 
this 
is 
normal 
matter, 
capable 
to 
form 
atoms 
and 
so, 
planets, 
stars, 
and 
galaxies. 
This 
is 
wrong. 
But 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
Universe, 
in 
the 
inflation 
era, 
was 
capable 
to 
form 
particles, 
albeit 
heavier. 
Why 
can’t 
space 
make 
more 
mass, 
even 
in 
the 
normal 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe? 
If 
it 
is 
possible, 
it 
has 
acted 
in 
a 
state 
of 
permanent 
accelerated 
expansion, 
like 
in 
this 
moment, 
and 
so, 
the 
cosmic 
relation 
Rc2/G=M 
is 
approximately 
exact; 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe 
can 
continuously 
increase 
in 
a 
direct 
relation 
to 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
Universe; 
if 
it 
is 
expanding 
in 
an 
accelerated 
way. 
Since 
particles 
are 
formed 
first. 
What 
kind 
of 
particles? 
To 
get 
masses, 
the 
particles 
use 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
basic 
in 
quantum 
mechanics: 
ℏ/cλ=m. 
We 
know 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism 
(modified) 
acts 
until 
λ≅1cm; 
and 
moreover, 
it 
pervades 
the 
entire 
Universe. 
The 
background 
microwave 
radiation 
pervades 
the 
entire 
Universe, 
and 
it 
has 
the 
λ 
exact 
to 
produce 
neutrinos. 
It 
may 
be 
possible, 
as 
an 
idea, 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
Higgs 
field 
with 
λ≅1cm, 
are 
acting, 
using 
this 
heat 
of 
2.7K 
and 
taking 
the 
microwaves 
as 
collision 
distance. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
background 
microwave 
radiation 
and 
the 
accelerated 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
are 
in 
just 
the 
exact 
point 
to 
produce 
mass. 
The 
particles–antiparticles 
pairs 
and 
the 
enormous 
existence 
of 
black 
holes 
separate 
them 
and 
produce 
positive 
matter 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
sends 



antimatter 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe. 
The 
mass 
of 
neutrinos 
is 
very 
small, 
but 
there 
exists 
another 
supposition. 
The 
gravity 
in 
the 
big 
black 
holes 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies, 
can 
produce 
a 
big 
pull 
of 
gravity, 
capable 
of 
deforming 
space, 
and 
shrink 
λ 
of 
the 
field 
of 
the 
formed 
particles, 
and 
changing 
them 
to 
another 
family, 
decreasing 
their 
λ 
and 
increasing 
their 
mass, 
and 
this 
process 
can 
continue 
inside 
black 
holes 
in 
a 
irreparable 
way 
to 
the 
center 
of 
the 
hole. 
This 
is 
only 
a 
supposition, 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
studied 
more. 
The 
neutrinos 
in 
their 
three 
varieties, 
and 
the 
supposed 
fourth 
family 
of 
neutrinos, 
the 
neutronio, 
the 
LHP, 
can 
be 
dark 
matter, 
and 
this 
matter 
is 
increasing 
deeply 
in 
our 
Universe. 
The 
halos 
around 
the 
galaxies 
can 
be 
neutronios, 
the 
LHP. 
The 
lighter 
neutrino 
is 
traveling 
almost 
like 
photons 
in 
the 
entire 
Universe. 
The 
LHP, 
or 
neutronio, 
can 
form 
halos 
around 
galaxies. 
Our 
conclusion, 
matter 
in 
our 
Universe 
is 
being 
produced 
permanently, 
but 
not 
ordinary 
matter, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
neutrinos 
(hot 
dark 
matter), 
or 
neutronio 
1; 
both 
of 
them, 
neutral 
particles. 
Moreover, 
the 
increase 
in 
black 
holes 
in 
number 
and 
size, 
also 
add 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
dark 
matter 
of 
the 
Universe 
(cold 
dark 
matter). 
Exotic 
dark 
matter 
is 
in 
doubt. 



171. 
Functions 
of 
black 
holes. 
Laws 
of 
thermodynamics 
Black 
holes 
have 
practically 
two 
fundamental 
functions: 
to 
contain 
a 
huge 
amount 
of 
entropy 
and 
to 
interchange 
antimatter 
with 
matter, 
to 
and 
from 
our 
parallel 
Universe. 
They 
don’t 
act 
as 
deposits 
of 
mass, 
neither 
do 
the 
supermassive 
black 
holes 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies. 
A 
supermassive 
black 
hole 
often 
has 
several 
million 
times 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
sun. 
But 
a 
normal 
galaxy 
has 
a 
mass 
around 
100 
billion 
times 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
sun. 
In 
that 
way, 
only 
a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
Universe 
appears 
to 
be 
inside 
black 
holes. 
However, 
the 
total 
entropy 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
mostly 
inside 
black 
holes 
and 
the 
entropy 
of 
the 
Universe 
has 
increased 
by 
an 
enormous 
amount 
since 
the 
beginning. 
The 
evaporation 
of 
black 
holes 
increases 
the 
entropy 
even 
more 
(around 
1/3 
more), 
but 
the 
density 
of 
entropy 
has 
diminished, 
because 
radiation 
spreads 
out 
over 
a 
huge 
region 
of 
space, 
and 
in 
black 
holes, 
it 
is 
packed 
into 
a 
small 
volume. 
The 
entropy 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
between 
ten 
googols: 
10101 
(or 
10x10100) 
to 
10121, 
considered 
the 
maximum 
possible 
entropy. 
We 
know, 
right 
now, 
the 
maximum 
bits 
of 
information 
of 
the 
Universe 
are 
equivalent 
to 
that 
maximum 
entropy. 
The 
rule 
is 
simple: 
the 
information 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
increase 
of 
entropy. 
Less 
possible 
entropy 
in 
a 
system 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
less 
information. 
Zero 
entropy 
doesn’t 
exist, 
because 
the 
information 
of 
Universe 
will 
never 
be 
zero. 
The 
first 
bit 
of 
information 
will 
always 
be 
present, 
like 
it 
was 
just 
at 
the 
beginning. 
We 
have 
two 
tendencies 
to 
zero 
entropy. 
According 
to 
thermodynamics, 
it 
will 
be 
0, 
when 
the 
temperature 
reaches 
0 
K; 
but 
this 
temperature 
cannot 
be 
reached, 
and 
only 
is 
a 
limit. 
In 
systems 
with 
big 
gravitational 
influences, 
like 
black 
holes, 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
or 
even, 
the 
whole 
Universe, 
entropy 
increases 
according 
to 
a 
mass 
increase 
(and 
decreases 
its 
temperature). 
In 
that 
case, 
entropy 
will 
never 
be 
zero, 
because 
the 
mass 
will 
never 
be 
zero. 
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
with 
maximum 
temperature 
1032K, 
and 
minimum 
mass, 
2.17x10-5 
g, 
the 
entropy 
was 



minimum. 
In 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
Universe, 
the 
temperature 
will 
be 
minimum 
(a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
a 
microKelvin) 
and 
the 
entropy 
will 
be 
maximum. 
The 
Universe 
acts 
like 
a 
black 
hole 
(or 
more 
accurately 
like 
two 
black 
holes, 
attached 
one 
with 
the 
other 
that 
exists 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe). 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
laws 
of 
thermodynamics 
have 
to 
be 
extended 
according 
to 
the 
gravitational 
effects, 
from 
a 
deep 
and 
exotic 
gravitational 
context. 



172. 
Dark 
energy 
and 
cosmological 
"constant" 
The 
dark 
energy 
comes 
from 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant”. 
Even 
if 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
decreases 
with 
time, 
the 
dark 
energy 
always 
increases 
until 
the 
end 
of 
Universe. 
This 
concept 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
contradiction. 
If 
the 
Universe 
is 
always, 
not 
only 
expanding 
but 
also 
accelerating, 
apparently 
it 
will 
never 
re-collapse 
in 
a 
big 
crunch 
and 
will 
continue 
forever. 
This 
would 
be 
true, 
without 
a 
dimensional 
change. 
The 
expansion 
of 
Universe 
is 
a 
hyperbolic 
function 
and 
that 
means 
its 
expansion 
will 
never 
cease 
even 
if 
it 
arrives 
to 
cofinity. 
But 
if 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
appears, 
and 
in 
a 
fractal 
dimension 
(in 
our 
case 
between 
3 
and 
4 
spatial 
dimensions), 
the 
Universe 
will 
change 
to 
a 
parabolic 
function 
and 
begin 
to 
collapse, 
reaching 
zero 
speed 
when 
it 
arrives 
to 
the 
new 
cofinite 
limit; 
we 
call 
this 
period 
Big 
Crush. 
After 
that, 
when 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
develops, 
the 
Universe 
will 
reach 
its 
inflection 
point, 
changing 
its 
direction, 
realizing 
a 
new 
phase 
of 
hyperbolic 
function. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
our 
Universe, 
after 
the 
Big 
Crush, 
the 
Big 
Crunch 
begins. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
paradox 
has 
its 
solution. 


Our 
Universe 
is 
expanding 
and 
accelerating, 
but 
will 
also 
re-collapse. 


Eventually, 
in 
the 
future, 
in 
our 
Universe, 
its 
temperature 
will 
fall 
down, 
producing 
ultra-cold 
temperatures, 
but 
never 
dropping 
to 
zero. 
And 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
will 
have 
maximum 
entropy. 
We 
know 
that, 
like 
in 
black 
holes, 
large 
amounts 
of 
mass 
means 
large 
entropy 
and 
cold 
temperatures. 
The 
minimum 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
will 
be 
a 
state 
of 
maximum 
mass. 
The 
mass 
increases 
in 
a 
linear 
proportion 
and 
volume 
increases 
to 
the 
third 
power. 
✓ 
Maximum 
mass: 
Approx. 
3.94x1060 
g 
✓ 
Maximum 
volume: 
Approx. 
1.05 
x1098 
cm3 
✓ 
Minimum 
density: 
3.76x10-38 
g/cm3 
The 
minimum 
mass 
density 
of 
our 
Universe, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
it, 
will 
be 
practically 
the 
density 
of 
a 
Higgs 
field 
of 
1 
cm. 
approx. 
or 
exactly 
0.687289278 
cm 
of 
λ 
(neutrino 
1), 
like 
we 
explained 
before. 


The 
density 
of 
vacuum 
energy 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
equivalent 
to 
a 
sea 
of 
neutrino 
fields, 
with 
a 
of 
collision 
distance 
of 



approx. 
1 
cm 
(exactly 
0.687289278 
cm). 



173. 
Minimum 
entropy 
at 
Big 
Bang 
and 
Big 
Crunch 
We 
explained 
why 
the 
Big 
Bang 
began 
with 
a 
low 
entropy 
state; 
and 
by 
the 
same 
reason, 
the 
condition 
or 
low 
entropy 
is 
also 
true, 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Crunch, 
just 
when 
the 
new 
Universe 
has 
its 
maximum 
length 
and 
its 
beginning 
to 
shrink. 
In 
both 
cases, 
the 
reason 
is 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
involved. 
When 
the 
Universe 
is 
stretching, 
the 
entropy 
increases. 
When 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
appears, 
there 
is 
an 
inflection 
point, 
where 
the 
Universe 
ends 
and 
the 
new 
Universe, 
with 
one 
more 
dimension, 
begins 
to 
move 
again 
in 
an 
opposite 
way. 
The 
big 
quantity 
of 
entropy 
is 
consumed 
to 
form 
the 
new 
dimension, 
and 
the 
new 
system 
begins 
with 
almost 
zero 
entropy, 
starting 
to 
increase 
newly, 
until 
the 
end 
of 
that 
Universe 
including 
the 
new 
Big 
Crush. 
In 
both, 
Big 
Bang 
and 
Big 
Crunch, 
there 
exist 
symmetry 
conditions. 
If 
the 
Universe 
would 
expand 
forever, 
we 
would 
consider 
the 
future 
to 
be 
absolutely 
unlike 
the 
past. 
This 
is 
unnatural 
and 
ugly, 
and 
also 
would 
be 
against 
the 
simpler 
mathematics. 
The 
only 
reason 
the 
Universe 
would 
expand 
forever, 
would 
be 
if 
it 
began 
from 
zero 
space. 
This 
is 
impossible. 
String 
theory 
affirms 
that 
the 
Big 
Bang 
began 
with 
λp 
as 
minimum 
space, 
and 
according 
to 
T-symmetry, 
the 
Universe 
will 
re-collapse 
after 
arriving 
to 
the 
maximum 
length, 
and 
a 
new 
dimension 
will 
appear. 
The 
solution 
of 
the 
puzzle 
is 
simple: 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
This 
affirmation 
solves 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
initial 
low 
entropy, 
and 
closes 
the 
Universe, 
even 
if 
the 
condition 
to 
be 
expanding 
(or 
contracting) 
and 
accelerating 
permanently, 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
function, 
tends 
to 
expand 
(or 
contract) 
it 
apparently 
forever. 



174. 
Absurdities 
in 
Physics: 
infinities 
and 
singularities 
To 
a 
mathematician, 
a 
dimension 
is 
a 
“degree 
of 
freedom”, 
an 
independent 
way 
of 
moving 
in 
space. 
And 
so, 
zero 
dimensions, 
has 
zero 
degrees 
of 
freedom, 
and 
is 
effectively 
confined 
to 
a 
single 
point, 
totally 
immobilized. 
Mathematically, 
we 
can 
talk 
about 
zero 
dimensions; 
point 
particles; 
singularities 
and 
infinities. 
But 
in 
physical 
terms, 
these 
are 
wrong 
positions. 
We 
insist, 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist 
in 
Physics. 
Nature 
uses 
logarithmical 
scales 
and 
we 
know 
log 
0 
or 
ln 
0 
are 
errors. 
Einstein 
and 
Minkowski 
affirmed 
that 
time 
is 
inextricably 
intertwined 
with 
the 
three 
dimensions 
of 
space, 
forming 
a 
new 
geometrical 
construct 
known 
as 
space-time, 
which 
Riemann 
had 
incorporated 
in 
his 
equations 
before. 
We 
can 
add: 
time 
is 
necessary 
for 
any 
universe 
with 
any 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
so, 
a 
zero 
dimensional 
universe 
doesn`t 
exist, 
but 
a 
one 
(0+1) 
dimensional 
Universe 
does. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
first 
universe 
was 
0+1, 
and 
so, 
exists 
inherently 
to 
it, 
a 
tendency 
to 
movement, 
with 
one 
degree 
of 
freedom. 
Even 
the 
principles 
of 
geometry 
also 
tell 
us 
that 
strange 
places, 
known 
as 
singularities, 
can 
exist. 
This 
is 
not 
true 
in 
physical 
terms. 
We 
know 
space 
zero 
doesn´t 
exist, 
and 
String 
theory 
explains 
that 
the 
minimum 
length 
is 
λp 
(1.615979906 
x10-33 
cm) 
and 
this 
concept 
has 
been 
conveniently 
applied 
to 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
The 
same 
concept 
needs 
to 
apply 
in 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole, 
where 
the 
singularity 
would 
be 
only 
a 
cosingularity. 
And 
the 
end 
of 
the 
time 
inside 
the 
black 
hole, 
doesn’t 
exist, 
only 
an 
opening 
to 
a 
parallel 
Universe. 
This 
is 
another 
reason 
why 
information 
is 
not 
lost 
in 
black 
holes. 
The 
inverse 
of 
a 
singularity 
is 
infinity; 
but 
existing 
only 
cosingularities, 
only 
confinities 
can 
exist. 
Besides 
that, 
plural 
singularities 
admit 
plural 
infinities. 
And 
this 
position 
is 
even 
worse. 
Plural 
infinities 
are 
impossible 
to 
exist, 
not 
only 
in 
any 
physical 
world; 
but 
also 
in 
a 
metaphysical 
concept. 
Infinity 
can’t 
have 
another 
besides 
it. 
Two 
infinities 
(or 
more) 
cancel 
the 
concept 
of 
infinity. 
The 
infinities 
in 
plural 
conditions 
would 
be 
only 
cofinities. 
Besides 
that, 
point 
particles 
don't 
exist.

Differential 
geometry 
Differential 
geometry 
is 
designed 
to 
operate 
on 
infinitesimal, 
small 
lengths 
that 
can 
work 
as 
close 
to 
zero, 
including 
sub-Planck 
distances 
scales. 
From 
a 
mathematical 
standpoint, 
there 
is 
no 
problem 
to 
extrapolate 
General 
Relativity 
to 
the 
smallest 
(sub-Planck) 
distances, 
but 
never, 
zero 
space; 
sub-
Planck 
distances 
are 
impossible 
to 
obtain, 
or 
to 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe; 
but 
they 
exist 
in 
the 
compactification 
space 
of 
worlds 
with 
bigger 
number 
of 
dimensions. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
theory 
and 
also, 
previous 
theories 
of 
fundamental 
physics, 
considered 
their 
basic 
building 
blocks, 
the 
particles, 
as 
infinitely 
small, 
zero 
dimensional 
point 
objects, 
that 
mathematics 
is 
equipped 
to 
handle, 
but 
not 
physics. 
String 
theory 
determines 
minimum 
sizes, 
and 
avoids 
zero 
and 
sub 
Planck 
distances. 
And 
so, 
the 
quantum 
fluctuations 
diminish 
their 
strength 
and 
make 
the 
fluctuations 
more 
manageable. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
curvature 
and 
density 
of 
space-time 
never 
blows 
up 
to 
infinity. 
This 
is 
a 
very 
important 
issue, 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
present 
in 
all 
physical 
concepts, 
not 
only 
in 
particles, 
but 
also 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
in 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole. 


Even, 
mathematically 
speaking, 
in 
String 
Theory, 
a 
non-simple 
connected 
manifold, 
is 
like 
a 
torus, 
with 
one 
or 
more 
holes, 
where 
some 
loops 
sitting 
on 
the 
surface 
cannot 
be 
shrunk 
down 
to 
points 
(zero 
sizes). 
This 
is 
chosen 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
particles 
of 
matter 
with 
their 
respective 
masses, 
keeping 
in 
mind 
that 
they 
are 
not 
simple 
points. 
However, 
the 
process 
to 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
particles, 
by 
means 
of 
theoretical 
calculations 
in 
String 
Theory, 
is 
very 
complicated, 
and 
until 
now, 
with 
no 
very 
successful 
results. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
theory 
has 
not 
even 
the 
minimum 
knowledge 
of 
how 
to 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
particles; 
and 
it 
obtains 
its 
results 
experimentally. 


But, 
obtaining 
masses 
is 
a 
very 
simple 
process, 
as 
we 
explained 
it 
before. 


We 
repeat 
again: 
using 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
fundamental 
in 
quantum 
mechanics. 


ℏ=mcλ 
or 
ℏ/cλ=m 


Without 
supersymmetry, 
String 
theory 
predicts 
impossible 
particles 
like 



tachyons, 
which 
travel 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
and 
have 
a 
negative 
squared 
mass, 
this 
is, 
their 
mass 
is 
expressed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
imaginary 
term 
i. 
Tachyons 
cannot 
exist 
in 
our 
world, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
them 
to 
exist 
in 
worlds 
with 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
where 
the 
speed 
of 
“our” 
light 
is 
slow. 
However, 
particles 
of 
matter 
without 
mass 
are 
impossible 
to 
exist 
in 
any 
physical 
world, 
with 
any 
number 
of 
dimensions. 
We 
insist 
in 
this 
concept. 


The 
only 
reason 
to 
speak 
about 
zero 
mass 
of 
particles 
is 
during 
the 
absence 
of 
particles 
of 
matter, 
or 
particles 
of 
force 
at 
rest. 



176. 
Curvature 
of 
spheres 
According 
to 
mathematics, 
the 
curvature 
of 
a 
sphere 
is 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
its 
squared 
radius. 
As 
the 
radius 
increases, 
the 
curvature 
decreases; 
and 
in 
a 
maximum 
expression: 
when 
the 
radius 
goes 
to 
infinity, 
the 
curvature 
goes 
to 
zero. 
Conversely, 
as 
the 
radius 
goes 
to 
zero 
(or 
in 
physical 
terms, 
cozero), 
the 
curvature 
blows 
up, 
and 
goes 
to 
cofinity 
(the 
maximum 
size 
possible). 
Nevertheless, 
only 
changing 
the 
mathematical 
terms 
(zero 
(0) 
and 
infinity 
(∞), 
to 
cozero 
(Ø) 
and 
cofinity 
( 
)) 
is 
not 
enough. 
Even 
the 
concept 
“the 
smaller 
the 
sphere, 
the 
sharper 
the 
curve”, 
(conversely, 
as 
the 
radius 
of 
a 
sphere 
increases, 
its 
curvature 
decreases) 
needs 
a 
physical 


explanation.
In 
effect, 
like 
we 
see 
in 
the 
figure, 
this 
concept 
is 
apparently 
true, 
but 
it 
depends 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
the 
observer. 
Einstein 
said 
that 
the 
results 
have 
to 
be 
the 
same 
to 
any 
observer, 
and 
in 
this 
sense, 
the 
former 
concept 
is 
only 
apparently 
valid. 
If 
the 
observer 
increases 
in 
size 
in 
the 
same 
scale 
as 
the 
observed 
object, 
the 
curvature 
of 
the 
sphere 
would 
remain 
the 
same 
to 
him. 
This 
effect 
is 
used 
to 
explain 
the 
change 
in 
the 
curvature 
of 
the 
Universe, 
considering 
the 
continuous 
accelerated 
expansion 
and 
even 
more, 
the 
period 
of 
inflation 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
capable 
“to 
flatten 
the 
Universe” 
from 
a 
big 
curvature 
at 
the 
beginning, 
to 
almost 
flat 
right 
now. 
But 
the 
Universe 
is 
not 
spherical, 
neither 
elliptical, 
but 
hyperbolic. 
If 
we 
see 
the 
development 
of 
a 
hyperbola 
(or 
a 
hyperboloid 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions), 
the 
curvature 
changes, 
from 
a 
big 
curvature 
at 
the 
beginning, 
in 
an 
asymptotic 
way, 
independent 
of 
the 
observer. 
The 
change 
to 
being 
almost 
flat 
is 
a 
function 
of 
its 
hyperbolic 
function; 
and 
it 
is 
inherent 
to 
its 
nature. 



177. 
Calabi-Yau, 
Euler 
characteristics 
The 
Calabi-Yau, 
with 
all 
of 
its 
beauty 
and 
mathematical 
inspiration, 
has 
been 
adapted 
to 
the 
Standard 
model, 
in 
the 
concept 
that 
all 
the 
elementary 
particles 
are 
divided 
into 
only 
three 
families 
or 
generations. 
Candelas 
and 
others 
worked 
a 
manifold, 
which 
yielded 
4 
families 
of 
particles; 
even 
if 
the 
difference 
was 
only 
one, 
the 
scales 
of 
particles 
are 
logarithmical, 
and 
so, 
it 
is 
logical 
that 
the 
difference 
between 
3 
and 
4 
is 
enormous. 
A 
heavy 
neutrino 
(the 
fourth 
one), 
found 
in 
other 
theories, 
has 
room 
in 
Candela’s 
approach. 


In 
order 
to 
adapt 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
the 
Calabi-Yau 
needed 
a 
manifold 
with 
an 
Euler 
characteristic 
of 
6 
or 
-6. 
Using 
a 
manifold 
with 
an 
Euler 
number 
of 
-6, 
Yau 
obtained 
4 
complex 
dimensions. 
He 
cut 
this 
into 
3 
complex 
dimensions 
(or 
six 
real 
dimensions). 
The 
manifold 
yielded 
9 
families 
of 
particles, 
rather 
than 
the 
desired 
3. 
Creating 
a 
quotient 
manifold 
in 
which 
every 
point 
corresponds 
to 
three 
points 
in 
the 
original, 
taking 
the 
quotient 
and 
dividing 
the 
original 
into 
3 
equivalent 
pieces, 
the 
number 
of 
points 
was 
decreased 
by 
a 
factor 
of 
3, 
and 
so 
the 
Standard 
Model’s 
number 
of 
families 
was 
obtained: 
3. 
The 
geometry 
and 
mathematics 
uses 
have 
been 
spectacular; 
but 
there 
has 
been 
a 
deficiency 
in 
the 
concepts 
of 
theoretical 
physics. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
is 
excellent 
for 
talking 
over 
the 
known 
particles 
and 
forces 
that 
can 
be 
tested, 
but 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
guess 
about 
unknown 
particles 
or 
at 
least, 
particles, 
whose 
corresponding 
scales 
of 
power 
(too 
heavy 
or 
too 
light), 
have 
been 
impossible 
to 
reach. 
Since 
the 
mathematical 
concept 
is 
one 
half 
of 
Euler’s 
Number, 
+6 
or 
-6, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
obtain 
two 
manifold, 
one 
to 
Euler 
+6, 
and 
the 
other, 
to 
Euler 
-6 
obtaining 
1/2 
(6)+1/2 
(6)=6 
families. 
The 
importance 
is 
in 
the 
physical 
theory, 
solving 
first 
some 
fundamental 
doubts: 
How 
many 
dimensions 
does 
the 
dimensional 
modulus 
have? 
How 
many 
components 
does 
each 
particular 
dimension 
have? 
Does 
all 
the 
components 
of 
each 
dimension 
have 
the 
same 
footing? 
Does 
each 
dimension 
have 
a 
different 
footing 
among 
other 
dimensions? 



Does 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
in 
a 
dimensional 
modulus 
diminish 
when 
the 
dimensions 
stretch 
(4 
in 
our 
Universe)? 
Why 
do 
the 
dimensions 
of 
string 
are 
10 
and 
26? 
How 
many 
families 
(or 
generations) 
of 
particles 
have 
existed 
in 
our 
Universe, 
from 
its 
beginning 
to 
its 
end? 
Will 
all 
the 
dimensions 
eventually 
stretch 
out? 
How 
did 
massless 
particles 
of 
matter 
existed 
before 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson? 
Why 
does 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
give 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter? 
Why 
do 
massless 
particles 
of 
matter 
existed 
before 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson? 
Why 
is 
the 
Higgs 
field 
destroyed 
by 
heat? 
Etc., 
etc. 


It 
is 
impossible 
to 
request 
a 
solution 
to 
mathematics 
and 
geometry 
if 
the 
physical 
theory 
is 
still 
incomplete. 



178. 
Calabi-Yau; 
heavypartners 
In 
order 
to 
accommodate 
only 
3 
families 
of 
particles, 
the 
Calabi-Yau 
has 
been 
accommodated 
to 
it. 
But 
superpartners 
(if 
they 
exist), 
or 
heavy 
partners 
(like 
heavier 
fermions, 
with 
only 
opposite 
helicity), 
double 
the 
number 
of 
particles, 
and 
needs 
room 
for 
another 
3 
families. 
Besides 
that, 
mass 
is 
a 
fundamental 
characteristic 
of 
particles, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
particles 
without 
mass 
need 
other 
scales. 
Considering 
that 
massless 
particles 
don’t 
exist, 
other 
three 
families 
are 
necessary 
to 
accommodate 
the 
heavier 
partners 
of 
the 
known 
particles. 
The 
families 
would 
be 
six 
in 
total, 
1/2(6) 
+ 
1/2(6). 
The 
sign 
(-) 
is 
discarded, 
because 
Euler’s 
number 
only 
uses 
absolute 
values. 
The 
Higgs 
field 
(we 
explained 
this 
before) 
is 
not 
destroyed 
by 
heat, 
and 
so, 
a 
heavier 
scale, 
with 
3 
families, 
has 
a 
perfect 
room 
to 
accommodate 
the 
heavier 
partners 
of 
the 
normal 
known 
particles 
of 
matter. 
They 
are 
really 
heavy, 
and 
from 
a 
symmetrical 
standpoint, 
need 
a 
similar 
logarithmical 
room 
to 
accommodate 
them. 


We 
insist, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
discard 
the 
supposition 
(which 
has 
no 
scientific 
explanations) 
that 
the 
Higgs 
field 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat, 
which 
leaves 
a 
big 
enough 
room 
to 
accommodate 
the 
heavy 
partners. 
The 
String 
theories 
could 
also 
accommodate 
their 
superpartners 
in 
the 
corresponding 
masses 
of 
the 
heavy 
partners 
that 
we 
prefer. 
But 
both 
need 
to 
eliminate 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
destruction 
of 
Higgs 
mechanism 
by 
heat. 


The 
particles 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale, 
in 
a 
symmetrical 
way, 
need 
a 
similar 
room 
to 
the 
normal 
scale 
to 
put 
them. 
Ranging 
from 
the 
heaviest 
particle, 
equivalent 
to 
Mp/√8π≅2.4x1018 
GeV, 
until 
K-12π. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
form 
a 
new 
room 
with 
3 
new 
families, 
with 
heavier 
particles 
(around 
1x1016 
times 
heavier). 



179. 
πminus, 
πplus; 
lighter 
and 
heavier 
scales; 
hook 
union 
Like 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
lightest 
scale 
uses 
the 
corresponding 
πminus: 
-3.114806939, 
and 
it 
is 
dependent 
of 
the 
maximum 
length 
of 
the 
Universe. 
The 
heavier 
scale 
uses 
πplus:-3.146056939, 
and 
it 
is 
dependent 
of 
the 
minimum 
length 
of 
the 
Universe 
(or 
Planck 
length). 
And 
so, 
we 
have 
incorporated 
two 
Euler 
numbers: 
+6 
and 
-6. 
For 
three 


families,itisnecessary+6or-6.With6families,itisnecessary+6and-6.
The 
heavypartners 
(or 
the 
superpartners) 
need 
room 
to 
be 
accommodated. 
To 
accept 
a 
small 
room, 
means 
piling 
up 
the 
superpartners 
(or 
the 
corresponding 
heavy 
partners) 
in 
an 
ugly 
symmetry, 
or 
in 
more 
exact 
terms, 
in 
a 
disastrous 



asymmetry. 
Each 
known 
particle 
and 
its 
corresponding 
partner, 
according 
to 
T-symmetry, 
have 
mirror 
symmetry. 
The 
antiparticles 
and 
the 
heavy 
partners 
have 


differenthelicity(oppositespin)comparedtoknownparticles.
We 
insist, 
the 
Standard 
model 
has 
yet 
eluded 
the 
theoretical 
masses 
of 
particles, 
or 
to 
predict 
new 
ones, 
while 
physicists 
now, 
have 
pursued 
strategies 
that 
only 
consider 
the 
Calabi-Yau 
manifolds. 
Masses 
of 
the 
supposed 
heavy 
partners, 
in 
a 
new 
3 
families 
scale, 
are 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections. 
Using 
symmetry 
with 
the 
normal 
particles, 
these 
heavy 
masses, 
could 
be 
used 
for 
the 
supposed 
superpartners. 
But 
we 
insist, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
eliminate 
the 
restriction 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
for 
another 
heavier 
scale. 


In 
the 
LHC 
energy, 
it 
will 
be 
only 
possible 
to 
find 
the 
LHP 
(or 
LSP), 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
and 
some 
combinations 
with 
the 
top 
quark; 
(or 
perhaps 
a 
Higgs 
boson 
with 
two 
varieties 
light 
and 
heavy), 
but 
no 
additional 
particles 



will 
appear 
in 
the 
range 
of 
102-103GeV. 



180. 
M 
theory. 
Dimensional 
manifolds. 
Standard 
model 
in 
8 
dimensions 
The 
last 
theory 
in 
the 
road 
of 
“String” 
theories 
is 
M 
theory, 
in 
which 
eleven 
dimensions 
exist, 
instead 
of 
ten. 
We 
insist, 
the 
mathematics 
and 
geometry 
have 
a 
wonderful 
development 
in 
this 
field, 
but 
physics 
is 
completely 
delayed. 
Like 
Maldacena 
notes: 
“Physicists 
claim 
to 
have 
a 
beautiful 
and 
consistent 
theory 
of 
quantum 
gravity, 
yet 
they 
cannot 
agree 
on 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions: 
some 
say 
ten, 
and 
some 
say 
eleven. 
Actually, 
our 
Universe 
may 
have 
both, 
ten 
and 
eleven 
dimensions.“ 
Some 
physics 
choose 
eleven, 
because 
they 
unite 
the 
five 
string 
theories 
in 
only 
one 
(we 
explained 
why 
this 
is 
so). 
But 
others 
prefer 
10, 
because 
(6+4) 
is 
easier 
to 
work 
with. 
The 
big 
problem 
with 
11 
dimensions 
(M 
theory) 
is 
breaking 
it 
into 
two 
worlds: 
4 
and 
7. 
Seven-
dimensional 
manifold, 
unlike 
normal 
Calabi-Yau 
manifold, 
cannot 
be 
complex, 
and 
nature 
works 
with 
complex 
numbers, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
with 
imaginary 
numbers. 
It 
even 
uses 
natural 
logarithms. 
Complex 
manifolds 
must 
have 
an 
even 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
like 
4, 
6, 
8…, 
including 
spatial 
dimensions 
plus 
one 
time 
dimension. 
Complex 
manifolds 
are 
much 
better 
to 
work 
with, 
much 
better 
to 
understand, 
and 
much 
better 
behaved. 
But 
the 
most 
important 
thing 
is 
that 
nature 
works 
better 
with 
complex 
manifolds. 
For 
that 
reason, 
we 
explained 
in 
former 
sections, 
Universes 
with 
odd 
dimensions 
(space-time) 
are 
not 
prospects 
for 
the 
development 
of 
communications 
or 
for 
promoting 
intelligent 
life. 
They 
need 
to 
exist 
in 
a 
rhythmic 
and 
symmetric 
way, 
returning 
to 
another 
Big 
Bang; 
in 
our 
case, 
until 
the 
sixth 
dimension 
(5+1) 
appears. 
After 
the 
Universes 
reaches 
its 
maximum 
in 
(3+1) 
dimensions 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
way, 
a 
Big 
Crush 
will 
follow 
in 
a 
fractal 
dimension 
(3~4+1), 
in 
a 
parabolic 
way, 
in 
a 
complete 
chaos, 
or 
a 
cataclysmic 
event, 
until 
it 
reaches 
the 
maximum 
length 
with 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
(4+1). 
Entropy 
began 
at 
its 
minimum 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
but 
will 
continue 
to 
increase 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
in 
the 
chaotic 
Big 
Crush; 
using 
this 
enormous 
quantity 
of 
entropy 
to 
form 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
Even 
at 
the 
maximum 
length 
in 
(4+1), 
the 
entropy 
will 
begin 
again 
in 
a 
minimum 
quantity; 
in 
a 
process 
known 
as 
Big 
Crunch, 
increasing 
its 
entropy, 
but 
shrinking 
in 
size, 
from 
the 
maximum 
expansion 
to 
the 
minimum 
length, 



reaching 
the 
cosingularity, 
in 
an 
accelerated 
hyperbolic 
contracting 
phase. 
Then 
a 
new 
Big 
Crush 
(4~5+1) 
will 
begin 
in 
a 
parabolic 
way 
until 
it 
reaches 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
(5+1), 
starting 
a 
new 
Big 
Bang. 
The 
process 
follows 
in 
a 
rhythmical 
way: 
Big 
Bang 
– 
Big 
Crush 
–Big 
Crunch 
– 
Big 
Crush 
-Big 
Bang 
– 
etc. 


With 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
dimension 
in 
a 
new 
period, 
the 
increase 
of 
entropy 
disappears; 
it 
is 
used 
to 
form 
the 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
No 
matter 
what 
configuration 
is 
selected 
for 
the 
internal 
dimensions, 
or 
how 
many 
dimensions 
the 
dimensional 
modulus 
has; 
all 
the 
dimensions 
eventually 
unwind 
and 
open 
up, 
but 
the 
modulus 
as 
an 
abstract 
space, 
will 
always 
exist. 
The 
dimensions 
become 
decompactified, 
but 
the 
modulus, 
with 
the 
abstract 
minimum 
limits, 
will 
always 
be 
present; 
even 
with 
the 
development 
of 
new 
moduli, 
and 
will 
continue 
adding 
(8) 
hidden 
dimensions 
to 
the 
continuous 
moduli 
series. 
Right 
now, 
a 
new 
strategy 
to 
apply 
the 
Standard 
model 
in 
eight-dimensional 
modulus 
(rather 
than 
in 
six-dimensional 
Calabi-Yau 
manifold) 
exists. 
However, 
the 
Calabi-Yau 
can 
also 
be 
described 
in 
an 
eight-dimensional 
(7+1) 
modulus, 
and 
include 
a 
satisfactory 
explanation 
for 
theoretical 
physics, 
but 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
continue 
developing 
new 
geometrical 
and 
mathematical 
strategies, 
when 
physics 
are 
not 
only 
delayed, 
but 
even 
worse, 
confused 
or 
mistaken 
in 
some 
concepts. 



181. 
Black 
holes 
as 
dark 
matter 
We 
wrote 
before 
that 
black 
holes 
are 
a 
kind 
of 
dark 
matter, 
but 
they 
deposit 
a 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
three 
normal 
neutrinos 
have 
masses, 
but 
their 
mass 
is 
too 
small 
to 
have 
any 
significant 
influence 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
dark 
matter. 
It’s 
necessary 
to 
find 
another 
heavier 
particle, 
with 
at 
least 
some 
stability 
or 
even 
better, 
completely 
stable, 
in 
order 
to 
yield 
the 
big 
% 
of 
dark 
matter 
existing 
in 
our 
Universe. 
The 
string 
theorists 
are 
looking 
for 
superpartners 
of 
the 
particles 
we 
know. 
The 
supposed 
lowest 
mass 
supersymmetric 
partner, 
could 
be 
the 
sneutrino, 
or 
the 
neutralino 
or 
the 
gravitino, 
considering 
that 
they 
exist. 
The 
lightest 
superpartner 
would 
be 
totally 
stable, 
because 
there 
would 
be 
nothing 
lighter 
in 
its 
class 
that 
it 
could 
decay 
into. 
Like 
we 
mentioned 
in 
several 
former 
sections, 
we 
include, 
as 
another 
possibility 
the 
neutronio, 
the 
lightest 
heavy 
partner, 
which 
is 
in 
the 
supposed 
case 
than 
no 
superpartner 
appears. 
All 
of 
them 
have 
remained 
invisible 
and 
hence 
“dark” 
matter. 
Already 
the 
superpartners 
(or 
its 
new 
version: 
the 
heavypartners), 
are 
much 
more 
massive 
than 
ordinary 
particles. 
In 
order 
to 
keep 
a 
new 
symmetry, 
the 
relation 
between 
an 
ordinary 
particle 
and 
its 
partner 
is 
around 
1016 
and 
so, 
only 
the 
partner 
of 
the 
lightest 
ordinary 
particle 
can 
appear 
in 
the 
LHC, 
or 
even 
in 
former 
colliders; 
with 
very 
careful 
experiments 
and 
calculations. 
The 
neutronio 
is 
a 
fermion 
(spin 
1/2), 
but 
its 
matter-antimatter 
pair 
is 
a 
scalar 
boson 
(spin 
0), 
like 
the 
Higgs 
boson. 
Moreover, 
the 
particle 
is 
neutral. 
Our 
calculations 
shows 
us 
that 
neutrino 
1, 
has 
a 
mass 
of 
approximately 
1.1256x10-14 
GeV. 
The 
relation 
with 
its 
partner 
is 
around 
1016 
(approx. 
1.175x1016) 
or 
132.26 
GeV, 
obtaining 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
LHP, 
or 
we 
may 
be 
find 
around 
this 
range, 
the 
LSP. 



182. 
Eigenstates 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Kaluza-
Klein 
graviton 
In 
the 
Randall–Sundrum 
theory 
of 
warping, 
the 
extra-dimensional 
space 
is 
bounded 
by 
two 
branes, 
with 
space-time 
between 
them 
curved 
everywhere, 
with 
gravity 
in 
two 
different 
scales 
of 
energy. 
This 
theory 
can 
be 
adapted 
to 
the 
eigenstates 
of 
our 
Universe, 
with 
2 
limits. 
In 
one 
limit, 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
in 
a 
high-density 
energy 
scale, 
gravity 
is 
strong, 
and 
just 
at 
the 
beginning, 
is 
united 
with 
the 
other 
three 
forces. 
In 
that 
moment, 
the 
first 
Higgs 
boson 
appears, 
gravitationally 
united. 
The 
graviton 
acquires 
mass, 
just 
at 
the 
first 
chronos, 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
this 
“heavy” 
graviton 
is 
the 
Kaluza-Klein 
graviton, 
that 
some 
physicists 
are 
looking 
for 
in 
the 
LHC 
Collider. 
However, 
in 
order 
to 
find 
it, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
arrive 
at 
Planck 
length, 
which 
is 
too 
far 
for 
now. 
According 
to 
this 
scale, 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale 
are 
formed 
in 
relation 
to 
Planck 
scale: 
1.2x1019 
GeV. 
Logarithmically 
speaking, 
this 
scale 
acts 
until 
√(λp) 
=4.02x10-17 
cm, 
where 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
appears 
(before 
that, 
close 
to 
Planck 
length, 
the 
second 
Higgs 
boson 
appeared 
at 
8.731x10-31 
cm 
or 
2.22x1016 
GeV). 
The 
other 
limit, 
on 
which 
we 
live, 
is 
a 
low-density 
energy 
scale. 
The 
light 
scale 
particles 
exist 
in 
distances 
longer 
than 
4.02x10-17 
cm. 
The 
limit 
of 
minimum 
energy 
density 
is 
the 
maximum 
length, 
2.9231x1032 
cm 
and 
the 
square 
root 
of 
its 
inverse 
is: 


√(1⁄λM)=5.849x10-17 
cm 
(scale 
of 
known 
particles) 


The 
lighter 
scale 
has 
relation 
with 
this 
measure 
as 
explained 
before. 
In 
the 
intermediate 
point, 
we 
have 
2 
measures, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
two 
Higgs 
fields, 
but 
only 
one 
Higgs 
boson. 



The 
different 
2 
scales: 
lighter 
↑ 
heavier 
↓. 
In 
k-12π 
there 
is 
a 
“hook”, 
interchanging 
values. 




183. 
Sizes 
of 
dimensions. 
Gravitational 
experiments 
Arkani-Hamed, 
Dimopoulos, 
and 
Dvali 
(often 
abbreviated 
ADD) 
considered 
that 
the 
extradimensions 
could 
be 
much 
larger 
than 
Planck 
scale, 
at 
least 
10-12 
cm 
and 
possibly 
as 
big 
as 
10-1. 
They 
said 
that 
this 
would 
be 
possible, 
if 
our 
Universe 
has 
4(3+1) 
dimensions 
and 
that 
a 
three 
spatial 
dimensional 
world 
is 
all 
we 
can 
see. 


This 
affirmation 
needs 
an 
additional 
explanation. 
In 
effect, 
we 
live 
on 
a 
world 
with 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
with 
an 
additional 
temporal 
dimension, 
known 
as 
time. 
All 
these 
three 
dimensions 
have 
the 
same 
footing, 
each 
equivalent 
to 
Planck 
length=1.615979906x10-33cm. 
Universes 
with 
bigger 
number 
of 
dimensions 
have 
smaller 
minimum 
lengths, 
and 
larger 
maximum 
lengths 
(according 
to 
T-symmetry). 
But 
in 
Universes 
with 
less 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
it 
is 
the 
opposite. 
The 
minimum 
limits 
of 
Universes 
with 
fewer 
dimensions 
are 
considerably 
bigger 
than 
our 
λp. 
In 
effect: 



The 
other 
Universes, 
with 
bigger 
number 
of 
dimensions 
have 
minimum 
sizes, 
smaller 
than 
our 
Planck 
length, 
and 
they 
will 
be 
not 
considered. 
The 
other 
condition 
of 
that 
theory 
is 
fundamental. 
“We 
cannot 
see 
more 
than 
the 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
in 
our 
world” 
(neither 
less). 


And 
so, 
even 
if 
some 
dimensions 
are 
smaller, 
belonging 
to 
other 
worlds 
and 
impossible 
to 
see 
them, 
in 
our 
world 
of 
feeble 
gravity. 
Regrettably, 
the 
particle 
accelerators 
probe 
the 
microcosmos 
utilizing 
the 
strong, 
weak 
and 
electromagnetic 
forces. 
The 
gravitational 
force 
is 
totally 
ignored. 


Remember, 
gravity 
is 
the 
only 
force 
that 
communicates 
among 
branes, 


and 
in 
the 
case 
of 
worlds 
with 
less 
dimensions, 
a 
large 
gravity 
and 
a 



considerably 
large 
pressure 
is 
necessary. 
New, 
highly 
sensitive 
gravitational 
experiments 
using 
big 
gravity 
would 
look 
for 
those 
larger 
curled-up 
dimensions, 
and 
before 
that, 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
to 
see 
the 
supposed 
prequarks, 
forming 
the 
interaction 
point 
of 
the 
particles 
and 
the 
prequark 
scenario. 



184. 
Masses 
of 
particles 
and 
in 
cosmic 
scale. 
Broglie 
wavelength 
Repeating 
some 
concepts 
we 
explained 
before, 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
particles, 
we 
use 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
which 
is 
basic 
to 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
use 
the 
formula 
ℏ=mcλ, 
where 
c 
is 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
the 
vacuum. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
we 
use 
in 
the 
accelerated 
stretching 
Universe 
the 
formula 
Rc2=GM, 
where 
c 
is 
also 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum. 
In 
accelerated 
expansion, 
space 
is 
always 
stretching 
faster 
than 
light, 
but 
we 
use 
c 
as 
the 
maximum 
speed 
of 
matter; 
c 
is 
then, 
the 
speed 
considered 
in 
both 
cases, 
independent 
of 
the 
speed 
of 
particles 
or 
the 
macroscopic 
objects. 
Differently, 
when 
we 
use 
Broglie 
wavelength, 
the 
momentum 
used 
is 
mv, 
where 
the 
velocity 
(v) 
is 
the 
exact 
velocity 
of 
particles 
or 
any 
material 
object. 
ℏ=mcλ 
is 
an 
exact 
formula; 
Rc2=GM 
is 
approximately 
exact, 
but 
at 
the 
first 
chronos, 
it 
was 
totally 
exact, 
and 
equivalent 
to 
another 
formula; 
c 
is 
always 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum. 
And 
so: 


✓ 
Rc2/G 
= 
M 
and 
ℏ/cλ 
= 
m 
✓ 
Rc2/G 
= 
ℏ/cλ 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
λ 
and 
R 
are 
equals, 
and 
so 
✓ 
Rλc3= 
Gℏ 
or 
c3λ2= 
Gℏ 
✓ 
λp 
= 
±√(Gℏ/c3) 
We 
have 
the 
minimum 
length, 
λp, 
approximately 
=±1.616x10-33 
cm. 
According 
to 
our 
theory, 
we 
can 
obtain 
the 
Planck 
length 
from 
a 
standpoint 
of 
space 
only, 
and 
so, 
we 
use 
the 
formula: 


✓ 
e-8πn-n/28 
where 
n=3 
✓ 
e-75.50536654=1.615979906x10-33 
cm 


The 
dimensional 
measure 
constant 
is 
k'=1 
cm, 
and 
proportional 
with 
other 
measures. 



185. 
Influence 
from 
extradimensional 
Universe 
According 
to 
the 
Superstring 
theory, 
all 
the 
fundamental 
properties 
of 
our 
Universe 
are 
determined, 
in 
large 
influence, 
by 
the 
geometrical 
size 
and 
shape 
of 
the 
extra 
dimensions. 
Moreover, 
the 
extradimensional 
theory 
determines 
fundamental 
physical 
measures, 
like 
particles 
masses 
and 
their 
charges. 
For 
us 
however, 
they 
have 
less 
influence, 
and 
they 
have 
relation 
only 
with 
λ 
and 
in 
consequence, 
with 
their 
masses. 
Their 
action 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
number 
of 
components 
of 
dimensions, 
not 
from 
their 
sizes 
or 
shapes. 
Even 
if 
string 
theory 
considers 
10 
dimensions 
for 
strings, 
we 
consider 
that 
each 
modulus 
is 
formed 
by 
8 
dimensions 
(7 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time). 
Nevertheless, 
there 
are 
not 
8 
dimensions, 
but 
28 
components, 
or 
degrees 
of 
freedom 
(0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7). 
Here 
are 
some 
examples; 
some 
results 
are 
in 
comparison 
with 
normal 
values. 




186. 
Impossibility 
to 
see 
more 
or 
fewer 
spatial 
dimensions 
than 
3 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
see 
more 
than 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
in 
our 
Universe, 
because 
bigger 
dimensions 
have 
a 
curled-up 
dimension 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length. 
Besides 
that, 
even 
an 
apparent 
two 
space 
dimensional 
object 
in 
our 
Universe, 
would 
be 
tridimensional; 
because 
the 
third 
space 
dimension 
is 
curled-up 
in 
λp, 
which 
is 
physically 
measurable. 
Remember, 
the 
third 
spatial 
dimension 
was 
formed 
by 
utilizing 
all 
the 
entropy 
from 
the 
Universe 
before 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
thus 
leaving 
the 
Big 
Bang 
with 
cozero 
entropy. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
all 
matter 
(including 
dark 
matter, 
normal 
matter 
and 
shadow 
matter) 
has 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
the 
fundamental 
particles 
of 
matter 
are 
formed 
by 
3 
prequarks 
and 
3 
varieties: 
3x1 
(leptons 
and 
quarks) 
3x2 
(mesons) 
and 
3x3 
(hadrons). 
For 
that 
reason: 
monopoles, 
cosmic 
strings, 
and 
domain 
walls 
don’t 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe. 


It 
is 
impossible 
to 
separate 
the 
prequarks 
,(even 
with 
enormous 
pressure 
or 
gravity. 
At 
the 
most, 
we 
could 
see 
the 
prequarks 
united. 
Gravity 
is 
the 
relation 
between 
dimensions, 
but 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
have 
a 
big 
enough 
gravity 
capable 
of 
changing 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
but 
we 
can 
bring 
them 
near, 
close 
to 
the 
frontier. 
The 
same 
energy 
that 
forms 
our 
Big 
Bang 
in 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
the 
fundamental 
force, 
(gravity 
and 
the 
other 
3 
forces 
united), 
is 
the 
same 
force 
that 
units 
the 
prequarks 
into 
the 
fundamental 
units. 


Moreover, 
by 
explaining 
the 
force 
that 
binds 
the 
preons 
(or 
prequarks), 
we 
can 
explain 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
properties, 
such 
as: 
color, 
charge, 
different 
color 
in 
quarks 
and 
leptons, 
unit 
of 
charge: 
0, 
±1/3, 
±2/3, 
±1…etc. 



187. 
Cosmic 
rays 
and 
heavy 
scale 
Concerning 
cosmic 
rays, 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
particles 
that 
a 
group 
of 
scientists 
consider 
to 
be 
mainly 
protons 
that 
travel 
trough 
the 
Universe. 
They 
arrive 
to 
the 
Earth’s 
atmosphere, 
where 
they 
collide 
with 
other 
particles 
or 
atoms 
producing 
others 
kinds 
of 
particles. 
They 
have 
been 
observed 
at 
energies 
of 
more 
than 
1011 
GeV. 
In 
that 
way 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
them 
to 
be 
protons, 
because 
with 
energy 
at 
rest 
of 
only 
1 
GeV, 
most 
of 
its 
energy 
would 
be 
kinetic 
energy, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
speed 
with 
practically 
the 
value 
of 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
This 
is 
against 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
relativity. 
In 
that 
way, 
these 
particles 
with 
extremely 
high-energy 
are 
not 
protons; 
they 
could 
be, 
still 
unknown 
particles, 
possible 
to 
explain 
with 
a 
heavier 
scale; 
and 
so, 
without 
having 
to 
wait 
for 
more 
powerful 
future 
accelerators, 
we 
could 
use 
natural 
colliders, 
such 
as 
cosmic 
rays. 
If 
we 
review 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
supposed 
heavier 
partners 
of 
the 
normal 
3 
neutrinos; 
we 
have, 
approximately: 
✓ 
Mass 
of 
the 
heavy 
partner 
of 
neutrino 
(1) 
-----132 
GeV. 
(neutronio 
1). 
✓ 
Mass 
of 
the 
heavy 
partner 
of 
neutrino 
(2) 
-----5.6x107 
GeV. 
(neutronio 
2). 
✓ 
Mass 
of 
the 
heavy 
partner 
of 
neutrino 
(3) 
-----3x1010 
GeV. 
(neutronio 
3). 
According 
to 
the 
energy 
considered, 
of 
around 
1010 
GeV, 
the 
energy 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
heavy 
partner 
of 
neutrino 
(3), 
but 
being 
unstable, 
it 
is 
possible 
for 
it 
to 
change 
its 
state 
to 
the 
second 
one, 
5.6x107, 
until 
it 
reaches 
the 
LHP 
at 
132 
GeV 
probably, 
stable, 
(at 
least, 
after 
its 
separation 
with 
its 
antimatter 
partner), 
traveling, 
and 
possibly 
forming 
halos 
around 
galaxies. 
The 
decrease 
of 
its 
mass 
is 
balanced 
by 
the 
kinetic 
energy. 
But 
insisting 
that 
a 
heavier 
scale 
of 
particles 
doesn’t 
exist, 
is 
putting 
unnecessary 
problems, 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
evidence 
of 
heavier 
particles, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
still 
unknown. 
A 
heavier 
scale 
would 
be 
the 
solution; 
and 
also, 
its 
existence 
is 
necessary 
to 
accommodate 
the 
superpartners, 
or 
the 
heavy 
partners, 
in 
case 
they 
exist. 
The 
explanations 
about 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
of 
matter 
are 
relatively 
simple, 
and 
we 
explained 
them 
in 
former 
sections. 



188. 
Smooth 
phase 
transition. 
Higgs 
bosons 
In 
physics, 
when 
we 
talk 
about 
the 
change 
of 
the 
state 
of 
matter, 
we 
need 
to 
distinguish 
between 
a 
smooth 
phase 
transition 
(also 
called 
“second 
order 
phase 
transitions") 
and 
a 
“first 
order 
phase 
transition”, 
like 
boiling 
water 
at 
normal 
conditions 
at 
100°C 
or 
the 
melting 
of 
ice 
at 
0°C, 
where 
the 
properties 
of 
matter 
change 
permanently 
and 
discontinuously. 
In 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism, 
we 
have 
both 
types 
of 
transitions, 
where 
in 
different 
λ 
of 
the 
system, 
the 
different 
particles 
are 
formed, 
according 
to 
their 
λ 
and 
in 
consequence, 
obtaining 
different 
masses. 
The 
different 
λ 
determine 
the 
“different 
influence” 
in 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism; 
a 
type 
of 
Yukawa 
coupling, 
capable 
of 
forming 
different 
masses. 
All 
the 
transitions 
of 
particles 
occur 
with 
different 
temperature. 
Less 
temperature 
means 
longer 
length, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
less 
mass. 
In 
determined 
circumstances 
(in 
special 
points 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale) 
special 
kinds 
of 
smooth 
transitions 
also 
exist, 
where 
a 
special 
energy 
of 
change 
of 
symmetry 
acts, 
which 
forms 
in 
Higgs 
mechanism 
particles 
known 
as 
Higgs 
bosons, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
so-called 
latent 
heat, 
where 
a 
change 
in 
the 
state 
of 
matter, 
without 
a 
change 
in 
temperature 
exists. 
Examples: 
it 
takes 
a 
measurable 
amount 
of 
energy 
to 
convert 
ice 
at 
0 
°C 
to 
liquid 
water 
at 
the 
same 
temperature; 
or 
liquid 
water 
at 
100 
°C 
to 
water 
vapor 
at 
the 
same 
temperature. 
In 
both 
cases, 
a 
change 
in 
state 
of 
matter 
or 
a 
change 
of 
symmetry 
exists. 
In 
the 
three 
normal 
states 
of 
matter 
there 
are 
two 
points 
of 
this 
“smooth” 
phase 
transitions. 
In 
the 
Higgs 
mechanism, 
with 
4 
forces 
involved, 
there 
are 
3 
points 
of 
this 
“smooth” 
phase 
transitions, 
where 
the 
remaining 
energy 
forms 
three 
Higgs 
bosons: 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
at 
k-24π, 
Higgs 
strong 
force 
boson 
at 
k-22π, 
and 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
at 
k-12π. 
There 
is 
no 
“smooth” 
transition 
in 
the 
electromagnetic 
point 
at 
k-20π; 
for 
that 
reason 
a 
Higgs 
electromagnetic 
boson 
doesn’t 
exist, 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
the 
photon 
always 
remains 
with 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest. 
Just 
in 
the 
Maximum, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe, 
a 
new 
gravitational 
Higgs 
boson 
will 
appear 
at 
k+24π, 
which 
will 
act 
outside 
of 
this 
Universe, 
just 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Crush, 
generating, 
or 
in 
better 
terms, 
announcing 
a 
cataclysm 
along 
a 
chaotic 
era, 



which 
will 
destroy 
our 
entire 
Universe 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
its 
corresponding 
parallel 
Universe. 
That 
would 
really 
be 
the 
“end 
of 
the 
world”. 
This 
Universe 
(3+1) 
will 
disappear, 
and 
the 
(4+1) 
Universe 
will 
begin 
to 
appear, 
passing 
previously 
through 
an 
epoch 
of 
fractal 
dimension, 
from 
3~4+1. 
In 
brief, 
Higgs 
particles 
(known 
and 
still 
unknown 
particles) 
are 
formed 
permanently, 
at 
different 
points 
on 
the 
scales. 
And 
so, 
all 
particles 
are 
bundles 
of 
that 
energy, 
each 
pair 
in 
its 
corresponding 
field. 
The 
bundles 
of 
leptons 
have 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
field 
divided 
by 
√(2π). 
The 
bundles 
of 
quarks 
or 
particles, 
where 
the 
strong 
force 
acts, 
have 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
field 
divided 
by 
√(8π), 
when 
they 
have 
similar 
masses, 
and 
by 
√(2π), 
when 
they 
are 
different. 
Sometimes 
resonances 
exist, 
making 
that 
division 
only 
approximate. 
Higgs 
bosons 
are 
only 
formed 
in 
three 
special 
points, 
which 
were 
detailed 
before, 
all 
of 
them, 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale. 



189. 
Hierarchy 
problem. 
Particles 
in 
LHC 
range 
The 
appearance 
of 
three 
Higgs 
bosons 
determines 
a 
heavier 
range 
of 
masses. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
strong 
force 
boson, 
from 
around 
4.43x1015 
to 
2.22x1016 
GeV, 
can 
be 
identified 
as 
the 
energy 
contained 
in 
the 
masses 
of 
these 
new 
heavy 
particles. 


Stronger 
forces 
are 
necessary 
in 
trying 
to 
unify 
gravitation 
with 
the 
other 
three 
forces 
of 
nature. 
Nobody 
has 
ever 
observed 
any 
effect 
of 
the 
gravitational 
forces 
among 
particles 
or 
within 
a 
single 
atom 
or 
molecule, 
and 
there 
is 
not 
much 
hope 
that 
anybody 
ever 
will. 
Our 
position 
is 
that 
all 
the 
particles 
have 
a 
measurable 
quantum 
wave; 
and 
their 
gravitational 
waves 
(real 
gravitation) 
are 
smaller 
than 
λp 
and 
so, 
the 
particles 
alone 
have 
no 
real 
gravitational 
effects. 
Planck 
energy 
(the 
energy 
at 
which 
the 
four 
fundamental 
force 
are 
equal) 
is 
1.2x1019 
GeV. 
It 
is 
the 
minimum 
mass, 
where 
particles 
have 
real 
gravitational 
waves. 
The 
heaviest 
particle 
has 
a 
mass 
of 
approx. 
2.4x1018 
GeV. 
The 
value 
of 
Planck 
energy 
is 
simply 
the 
fundamental 
unit 
of 
energy. 
However, 
science 
has 
an 
unresolved 
question 
Why 
do 
the 
known 
energies 
of 
particles 
are 
much 
smaller? 
In 
the 
original 
version 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
the 
masses 
of 
known 
particles 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson. 
Physicists 
consider 
the 
Higgs 
boson 
mass 
could 
not 
be 
greater 
than 
1000 
GeV 
(and 
we 
add, 
it 
could 
not 
be 
greater 
than 
482.4 
GeV). 
But 
Planck 
energy 
is 
1.2x1019 
GeV, 
this 
is, 
2.49x1016 
times 
heavier. 
The 
puzzle 
of 
explaining 
this 
enormous 
difference 
in 
fundamental 
energy 
is 
known 
as 
the 
hierarchy 
problem. 
The 
explanation 
however, 
is 
very 
simple. 
The 
scales 
in 
nature 
are 
logarithmical, 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
a 
particle 
depends 
fundamentally 
in 
the 
involved 
wavelength. 
Planck 
length 
determines 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale; 
(the 
shortest 
λ 
and 
so, 
the 
heaviest 
mass), 
and 
the 
length 
of 
the 
field 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
determines 
the 
end 
of 
the 
heavier 
scale 
(the 
longest 
λ 
and 
so, 
the 
lightest 
mass). 
There 
apparently 
exists 
a 
big 
difference, 
but 
in 



logarithmical 
measure, 
it's 
only 
its 
half. 
In 
effect: 
✓ 
lnλHwB=-37.75268327 
✓ 
lnλp=-75.50536654 
Relation: 
1/2 
(or 
the 
square 
root 
in 
arithmetical 
values) 
of 
their 
corresponding 
λ. 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
acts 
with 
W+ 
W-and 
Z0 
in 
its 
massive 
style 
(k-12π). 
Higgs 
strong 
force 
boson 
acts 
with 
new 
extra-strong 
force, 
and 
massive 
gluons 
(k-22π). 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
acts 
with 
a 
new 
hypergravitational 
force, 
and 
massive 
gravitons 
(this 
is 
exactly 
true, 
only 
in 
k-24π, 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang). 
We 
expect 
that 
the 
three 
Higgs 
bosons 
or 
the 
other 
heavier 
particles, 
required 
to 
satisfy 
the 
hierarchy 
problem, 
will 
be 
identified 
in 
a 
sufficiently 
powerful 
accelerator, 
or 
natural 
colliders, 
such 
as 
cosmic 
rays, 
in 
the 
future. 


With 
the 
LHC, 
the 
Higgs 
weak-boson 
and 
the 
lightest 
heavy 
partner, 
a 
neutral 
particle 
that 
we 
named 
neutronio, 
will 
appear 
as 
new 
particles, 
and 
no 
more, 
except 
for 
some 
combinations 
of 
the 
top 
quark. 



190. 
Standard 
Model. 
Neutrinos 
Steven 
Weinberg 
is 
clear 
to 
affirm 
in 
his 
book 
“Dreams 
of 
a 
Final 
Theory”, 
that 
the 
Standard 
Model 
is 
only 
a 
low-energy 
approximation 
to 
a 
really 
fundamental 
unified 
theory 
and 
that 
it 
loses 
its 
validity 
at 
energies 
like 
Planck 
energy. 
And 
later 
adds, 
“In 
the 
Standard 
Model 
keeping 
the 
neutrinos 
massless, 
but 
we 
would 
expect 
neutrinos 
to 
have 
small 
masses, 
about 
a 
hundredth 
to 
a 
thousandth 
of 
a 
volt 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
about 
one 
billionth 
the 
mass 
of 
an 
electron. 
The 
mass 
is 
much 
too 
small 
to 
have 
been 
noticed 
in 
any 
laboratory 
experiment 
done 
so 
far, 
but 
it 
could 
have 
a 
subtle 
effect, 
of 
allowing 
neutrinos 
that 
start 
out 
as 
electron-type 
neutrinos 
to 
turn 
slowly 
into 
neutrinos 
of 
other 
types 
(decreasing 
its 
λ). 
This 
may 
explain 
a 
long-standing 
puzzle, 
that 
fewer 
neutrinos 
than 
expected 
are 
detected 
to 
be 
coming 
from 
the 
sun”. 
These 
suppositions 
are 
correct, 
and 
so: 


1. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
fails 
in 
to 
deny 
the 
masses 
of 
neutrinos. 
2. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
is 
only 
an 
approximation 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
of 
our 
Universe, 
considering 
only 
the 
lighter 
scale 
approximately. 
3. 
This 
supposed 
mass 
of 
the 
electron-type 
neutrino, 
according 
to 
Steven 
Weinberg, 
is 
practically 
exact; 
and 
it 
is 
the 
best 
approximation 
of 
all 
the 
former 
supposed 
masses 
of 
this 
neutrino. 
4. 
The 
electron-type 
neutrinos 
seem 
to 
be 
missing, 
because 
as 
they 
pass 
through 
the 
sun, 
they 
turn 
into 
neutrinos 
of 
other 
types. 

191. 
Standard 
Model 
and 
the 
light 
and 
heavy 
scale 
The 
Standard 
Model 
considers 
almost 
all 
of 
the 
lighter 
scale 
(leaves 
outside 
the 
neutrinos) 
and 
includes 
a 
small 
part 
of 
heavier 
scale 
(when 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
formed). 
Only 
the 
heavier 
scale 
has 
the 
three 
Higgs 
bosons 
and 
in 
consequence, 
in 
those 
moments, 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
acquire 
mass. 



For 
that 
reason, 
reaching 
the 
range 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
still 
pending 
discovery, 
the 
particles 
of 
force: 
W+, 
W-and 
Z0 
acquire 
mass. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
when 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
access 
the 
range 
of 
the 
Higgs 
strong 
force 
boson, 
the 
gluon 
will 
acquire 
mass. 
Moreover, 
when 
the 
energy 
in 
the 
range 
of 
the 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
is 
reached, 
just 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
gravitation 
and 
the 
other 
three 
forces 
were 
equal, 
exactly 
at 
Planck 
energy, 
the 
graviton, 
as 
a 
particle 
of 
force, 
will 
acquire 
mass. 
In 
the 
beginning 
of 
String 
Theory, 
a 
particle 
was 
discovered, 
almost 
equal 
to 



the 
common 
graviton, 
except 
that 
this 
particle 
would 
produce 
forces 
that 
are 
like 
gravitational 
forces 
but 
1038 
times 
stronger. 
This 
particle 
and 
the 
normal 
graviton 
were 
considered 
to 
be 
both 
massless. 
Even 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
correct 
this 
difference, 
increasing 
the 
string 
tension, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
consider 
that 
those 
gravitational 
forces 
were 
1038 
times 
stronger, 
only 
because 
gravitons, 
at 
those 
moments, 
had 
mass, 
around 
Planck 
mass. 
In 
any 
case, 
if 
the 
symmetry 
was 
broken 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
separating 
gravity 
from 
the 
other 
three 
forces, 
a 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
would 
have 
been 
formed 
and 
the 
graviton 
would 
have 
acquired 
mass. 
It 
would 
have 
established 
a 
quadrupole 
with 
4 
identical-mass 
quarks 
of 
(1.2x1019 
GeV)/√(8π) 
≅ 
2.4x1018 
GeV 
each. 
These 
gravitational 
effects 
disappeared 
almost 
immediately, 
and 
the 
common 
graviton, 
the 
particle 
of 
gravitational 
radiation, 
with 
zero 
mass 
and 
always 
with 
spin 
2, 
without 
strong 
neither 
weak 
nuclear 
forces, 
appeared. 
And 
so 
it 
will 
remain, 
without 
mass, 
and 
without 
change, 
until 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe. 



192. 
Gravitational 
waves. 
Hyperforce 
and 
prequarks 
Gravitational 
waves 
carry 
detailed 
information 
of 
the 
emitter; 
they 
are 
coherent: 
coherent 
bulk 
motions 
of 
matter 
or 
coherent 
vibrations 
of 
space-
time 
curvature. 
Gravity 
waves 
are 
transverse 
and 
traceless, 
and 
this 
is 
classical 
consequence 
of 
the 
spin–2 
of 
the 
graviton. 
According 
to 
that, 
the 
letters 
TT 
are 
accompanied 
on 
the 
gravitational 
wave-field. 
Because 
of 
its 
TT 
nature, 
any 
gravitational 
wave 
tends 
to 
produce 
a 


quadrupole.
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
just 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe, 
the 
four 
forces 
had 
the 
same 
strength, 
and 
the 
quantum 
wave 
and 
gravitational 
wave 
were 
equal. 
In 
that 
moment, 
there 
existed 
only 
one 
Higgs 
field, 
whose 
nature 
is 
gravitational. 
The 
quadrupole 
(four 
poles) 
determines 
four 
quarks 
of 
the 
same 
strength, 
with 
approximately 
2.4x1018 
GeV 
each. 
The 
graviton 
acquires 
mass 



at 
that 
very 
moment. 
The 
quadrupole 
exists 
at 
the 
four 
points 
of 
the 
graph: 
x, 
x1, 
y, 
and 
y1. 
This 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
graviton. 
The 
four 
quarks 
acquire 
mass 
by 
means 
of 
λp. 
The 
λp 
gives 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
field. 
Each 
pole 
(quark) 
is 
obtained 
by 
dividing 
it 
by 
√(8π). 
The 
quadrupole 
formalism 
in 
gravity 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
dipole 
formalism 
in 
the 
radio-wave 
generation. 
The 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson 
is 
at 
k-24π, 
the 
moment 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
and 
Mplanck=1.2 
x1019 
GeV 
or 
2.17x10-5 
g. 
This 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
hypergravity 
that 
begins 
at 
the 
very 
Big 
Bang 
at 
1.616x10-33 
cm, 
and 
disappears, 
diminishing 
step 
by 
step, 
at 
around 
3.50x10-31 
cm, 
when 
the 
heavy 
strong 
force 
begins 
to 
establish 
its 
control. 
This 
“hypergravity” 
force, 
acts 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
first 
Higgs 
boson 
(gravitational); 
and 
the 
graviton, 
acquires 
mass. 
After 
that, 
normal 
gravity 
acts 
with 
a 
zero 
mass 
graviton 
and 
a 
very 
feeble 
force. 
This 
hypergravity 
is 
the 
fundamental 
cause 
of 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
third 
spatial 
dimension 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
and 
so, 
although 
already 
inexistent, 
is 
immerse 
in 
any 
object 
or 
particle 
in 
our 
Universe. 
All 
of 
them 
have 
three 
spatial 
dimensions. 
It 
is 
impossible 
for 
objects 
of 
0, 
1 
or 
2 
spatial 
dimensions 
to 
exist 
in 
our 
world. 
And 
so, 
the 
particles, 
the 
fundamental 
blocks 
of 
our 
Universe, 
need 
three 
“strings” 
to 
exist. 
The 
existence 
of 
prequarks, 
(or 
preons) 
detailed 
before, 
is 
not 
only 
possible; 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
they 
don’t 
exist, 
albeit 
only 
in 
hidden 
structures. 



193. 
Hypergravity's 
sphere 
of 
influence. 
Heavy 
protons 
The 
sphere 
of 
influence 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
“hypergravity” 
force 
is 
until 
1x10-7 
g, 
5.53x1016 
GeV, 
or 
k-22.29π. 
In 
k-22π 
the 
strong 
force 
Higgs 
boson 
appears, 
but 
its 
influence 
begins 
when 
the 
gravitational 
influence 
disappears, 
at 
around 
k-22.29π. 
At 
λ=5.916x10-31, 
3.278x1016 
GeV, 
or 
5.93x10-8 
g 
is 
the 
range 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
heavy 
proton 
(with 
the 
neutron 
a 
little 
heavier 
than 
the 
proton). 
The 
calculation 
to 
obtain 
this 
mass 
(we 
can 
also 
get 
it 
with 
exact 
k): 


(k-23π)=(-23)(3.146056939)=-72.3593096 
λ=(exp-72.3593096)=3.756220925x10-32 
cm=5.166x1017 
(field) 
heavy 
proton=5.1626x1017 
GeV/(√2π)3=3.278x1016 
GeV 
approx. 
or 
5.93x10-8 
g 


In 
similar 
terms, 
the 
calculation 
used 
to 
obtain 
the 
mass 
of 
normal 
proton 
(k11π), 
where 
we 
use 
the 
lighter 
scale: 
3.111480939 
and 
so: 


(k-11π)=(-11)(3.114806939)=-34.26287633 
λ=(exp-34.26287633)=1.317716173x10-15 
cm=14.71637095 
GeV 
(field) 
Normal 
proton= 
14.71637095/(√2π)3=0.9344GeV 
or 
1.69x10-24 
g 
(approx.) 


The 
heavy 
neutron 
and 
the 
normal 
neutron, 
are 
unstable 
and 
decay 
into 
their 
corresponding 
proton 
(or 
heavy 
proton); 
electron 
(or 
heavy 
electron); 
and 
“neutrino” 
(or 
heavy 
“neutrino”, 
named 
neutronio). 
But 
this 
heavy 
proton 
is 
unstable 
too. 
The 
theory, 
speaking 
about 
the 
decay 
of 
the 
proton, 
is 
really 
referred 
to 
this 
heavy 
proton. 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
the 
time 
of 
supposed 
decay 
of 
the 
normal 
proton 
is 
considerably 
longer 
than 
the 
time 
of 
our 
Universe, 
which 
will 
occur 
at 
9.7504x1021 
s 
or 
3.0897x1014 
years. 
This 
supposed 
decay 
of 
a 
normal 
proton 
violates 
some 
long-established 
properties 
in 
quantum 
field 
theory; 
but 
remember, 
they 
have 
been 
considered 
point 
particles. 
Every 
particle, 
like 
every 
object 
in 
our 
Universe, 
has 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
and 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
invoke 
new 
theoretical 
principles. 



Moreover, 
heavy 
protons 
don’t 
form 
complex 
structures. 
They 
will 
be 
constructed 
in 
the 
macrocosmos 
era, 
when 
the 
Universe 
is 
cooler 
and 
the 
formation 
of 
complex 
structures 
is 
done. 
Definitely, 
the 
decay 
of 
heavy 
proton 
violates 
baryon 
and 
lepton 
number 
conservation, 
but 
this 
principle 
is 
correct 
only 
in 
the 
first 
scale, 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
normal 
proton 
stable, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
to 
form 
(completely 
stable) 
aggregated 
matter, 
atoms, 
and 
complex 
structures. 
The 
normal 
proton 
is 
stable. 
This 
gives 
the 
necessary 
stability 
to 
our 
macrocospic 
world. 
The 
stability 
of 
the 
normal 
proton 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
first 
scale 
there 
is 
no 
symmetry 
breaking 
(or 
appearance 
of 
Higgs 
bosons); 
only 
in 
the 
second 
scale, 
where 
the 
heavy 
proton 
appears. 
The 
instability 
of 
the 
heavy 
proton 
(including 
the 
violation 
of 
the 
lepton 
and 
baryon 
number 
conservation, 
is 
not 
only 
possible, 
but 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
avoid 
the 
production 
of 
“heavy” 
matter. 
The 
second 
scale 
makes 
heavy 
partners, 
but 
only 
heavy 
particles. 
The 
heavy 
partners 
existed 
in 
the 
precise 
moment 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
era 
and 
disappeared 
at 
least 
in 
normal 
conditions, 
except 
for 
the 
lightest 
of 
them, 
the 
neutronio, 
that 
acts 
as 
the 
other 
members 
of 
the 
first 
family 
of 
the 
first 
scale, 
using 
π 
minus, 
like 
we 
explained 
before. 
However 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
separate 
it 
from 
its 
antiparticle. 
The 
pair 
is 
unstable 
and 
decays 
basically 
into 
2 
photons, 
and 
sometimes 
into 
ZZ. 
The 
neutronio 
(the 
only 
particle 
of 
the 
second 
scale 
that 
is 
stable) 
is 
an 
ideal 
candidate 
to 
constitute 
dark 
matter. 



194. 
Fundamental 
mathematical 
formulas: 
Einstein's 
and 
Euler's 
This 
book 
has 
incorporated 
minimum 
mathematical 
operations, 
normally 
easy 
to 
understand. 
To 
read 
it, 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
be 
a 
mathematician. 
It 
is 
only 
necessary 
to 
know 
fundamental 
and 
simple 
concepts. 
Hawking 
mentioned 
in 
his 
book 
“A 
Brief 
History 
of 
Time”, 
that 
using 
only 
one 
formula, 
their 
lectors 
would 
diminish 
considerably. 
However, 
he 
still 
used 
in 
his 
book 
Einstein’s 
formula: 
E=mc2, 
which 
most 
physicists 
consider 
as 
the 
most 
famous 
physical 
relation. 
This 
is 
no 
doubt; 
this 
formula 
is 
practically 
the 
most 
(or 
the 
least 
one 
of 
the 
most) 
important 
physical 
relations 
in 
our 
world 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimension 
+ 
one 
time, 
but 
it 
has 
no 
application 
in 
other 
dimensionally 
different 
worlds. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
need 
to 
use 
complex 
numbers, 
and 
their 
fundamental 
relation 
is 
Euler’s 
formula: 
eiπ+1=0. 
Which 
relates 
the 
five 
fundamental 
numbers: 
0, 
1, 
e, 
i, 
π, 
seeming 
an 
esoteric 
formula, 
or 
a 
mystical 
expression; 
but 
it 
is 
real, 
physically 
and 
mathematically. 
If 
we 
use 
the 
unit 
circle 
of 
complex 
numbers, 
we 
obtain 
a 


derivedformula(Cottes-Euler):eiθ=cosθ+isenθ.
The 
plan 
is 
to 
convert 
the 
complex 
equation, 
with 
an 
imaginary 
part, 
into 
only 
its 
real 
part. 
In 
that 
way, 
p 
can 
wind 
around 
the 
origin 
many 
times, 
and 



so, 
we 
can 
allow 
p 
to 
wind, 
adding 
any 
integer 
multiple 
from 
2π 
to 
θ. 
Using 
String 
theory, 
we 
have 
a 
two-position 
eigenstate 
in 
this 
unit 
circle. 
One 
for 
a 
vibration 
mode 
and 
another, 
approximately 
its 
inverse, 
is 
related 
to 
a 
winding 
mode. 
Like 
we 
explained 
in 
former 
sections, 
by 
deriving 
these 
formulas 
and 
relations, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
general 
formula 
to 
obtain 
the 
minimum 
(Planck) 
and 
another 
formula 
to 
obtain 
the 
maximum. 


Minimum: 
e-8πn-n/28 
cm 
Minimum 
=1.615979906x10-33 
cm 


Maximum: 
e+8πn-(2n^2)/28 
cm 
Maximum= 
2.923096699x1032 
cm 


Where 
n 
in 
our 
Universe 
is 
3. 


We 
explained 
before, 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
of 
the 
first 
modulus 
is 
8; 
including 
time 
with 
0 
spatial 
dimensions, 
but 
with 
defined 
space. 
Einstein 
defined 
a 
reality 
in 
any 
dimension 
of 
all 
Universes: 
Space 
and 
time 
are 
not 
two 
separated 
entities. 
They 
are 
always 
united. 
Moreover, 
all 
the 
spatial 
dimensions 
have 
the 
same 
footing 
in 
a 
particular 
Universe; 
but 
are 
different 
between 
others. 
Even 
if 
the 
modulus 
is 
8, 
the 
dimensional 
components 
or 
degrees 
of 
freedom 
would 
be: 
0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7 
= 
28. 
The 
dimensions 
of 
the 
strings 
are 
10 
and 
26 
because 
they 
are 
the 
closer 
dimensions 
of 
strings, 
with 
enough 
room 
to 
incorporate 
our 
Universe. 
The 
first 
sequence, 
logically 
derived 
from 
a 
string, 
is 
2 
(1+1), 
but 
it 
has 
no 
room 
to 
accommodate 
a 
world 
of 
4 
(3+1). 
10 
is 
the 
dimension 
of 
strings 
too, 
because 
this 
is 
the 
relation 
with 
the 
second 
modulus: 
8 
+ 
2 
(1+1) 
and 
26, 
with 
the 
third 
active 
modulus 
(8+8+8)+2 
(1+1), 
an 
so 
on. 
For 
the 
first 
dimensional 
package, 
the 
dimensions 
of 
string 
are: 
2, 
10, 
26, 
50, 
82,132,170, 
and 
226. 
The 
first 
package 
has 
224 
dimensions. 
226 
represents 
28(8) 
+ 
2. 
These 
two 
new 
dimensions 
are 
the 
dimensions 
from 
the 
string, 
(1+1) 
of 
the 
second 
package. 
Michio 
Kaku, 
in 
his 
book 
“Hyperspace”, 
wrote: 
“In 
others 
words, 
physicists 
have 
not 
the 
slightest 
understanding 
of 
why 
10 
and 
26,are 
single 
out 
as 
the 
dimensions 
of 
string”. 
Completing 
this 
information 
with 
the 
information 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections 
about 
this 
issue, 
we 
consider 
our 
position 
is 
more 
than 
a 
slightest 
idea. 



One 
concept 
is 
fundamental: 


It 
is 
inconvenient, 
or 
even 
worse, 
impossible, 
to 
establish 
as 
exact 
rules, 
a 
theory 
with 
10 
(or 
eleven) 
and 
26 
dimensions, 
in 
a 
world 
with 
only 
4. 



195. 
Dimensional 
moduli 
in 
8 
dimensions. 
Valence 
of 
Universes 
All 
the 
dimensional 
moduli 
have 
8 
dimensions, 
even 
in 
String 
theories, 
in 
mathematicians 
investigating 
lattices, 
in 
higher 
dimensions, 
including 
lattices 
that 
are 
self-dual 
(are 
coincident 
with 
the 
dual 
lattice). 
It 
is 
important 
to 
reaffirm 
that 
even 
self-dual 
lattices 
only 
occur 
in 
8 
dimensions 
or 
in 
multiples 
of 
8. 
The 
general 
position, 
actually, 
is 
that 
the 
Universe 
began 
with 
10 
dimensions 
(and 
for 
others, 
eleven). 
This 
is 
a 
mixture 
of 
mathematical 
accuracy 
and 
confusing 
physical 
terms. 


• 
It 
is 
correct 
that 
10 
and 
26 
are 
the 
dimensions 
of 
string, 
but 
also 
50, 
82,122, 
. 
. 
. 
etc. 
• 
The 
fundamental 
dimension 
of 
strings 
is 
two 
(1+1), 
but 
it 
has 
not 
enough 
room 
to 
accommodate 
the 
particles 
or 
forces 
of 
our 
world. 
• 
The 
moduli 
have 
8 
dimensions 
each. 
• 
The 
reason, 
why 
the 
dimension 
of 
strings 
is 
10, 
is 
because 
a 
modulus 
(with 
eight-dimensional 
construction) 
has 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
string 
(2) 
of 
the 
second 
modulus 
attached 
to 
it. 
The 
total 
of 
the 
dimensions 
are 
10, 
but 
the 
“valence” 
is 
two 
(like 
in 
chemistry, 
with 
electron 
orbitals). 
• 
The 
valence 
of 
membranes 
(2+1) 
is 
3 
and 
so, 
the 
sequence 
is 
3,11,27… 
• 
The 
valence 
of 
particles 
(3+1) 
is 
4 
and 
so, 
the 
sequences 
are 
4 
(our 
world), 
12, 
28, 
… 
• 
We 
can 
represent 
every 
dimension 
until 
11, 
because 
until 
this 
limit, 
our 
Universe 
is 
still 
inside 
the 
first 
sequence. 
Dimension 
12 
is 
already 
in 
the 
second 
sequence, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
there 
are 
some 
differences, 
according 
to 
its 
participation 
in 
a 
new 
dimensional 
modulus. 
One 
of 
them: 
a 
theory 
of 
12 
dimensions, 
or 
more, 
necessarily 
produces 
massless 
particles 
with 
spin 
greater 
than 
2, 
something 
that 
experimental 
and 
theoretical 
reasons 
eliminate 
in 
our 
world. 
• 
Mixing 
the 
second 
modulus 
of 
string 
(10) 
with 
the 
first 
modulus 
of 
particles 
(4)(our 
world) 
is 
an 
error. 
The 
result 
10-4 
=6 
doesn’t 
have 
any 
physical 
significance, 
and 
so, 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
Calabi-Yau 
of 
6 
dimensions, 
results 
mathematically 
valid 
but 
physically 
incorrect. 

• 
Our 
world 
is 
not 
a 
world 
of 
strings. 
The 
string 
universe 
began 
and 
has 
already 
ended, 
and 
will 
return, 
when 
the 
second 
modulus 
of 
strings 
appear, 
in 
10 
dimensions. 
A 
lot 
of 
other 
considerations 
about 
this 
topic 
were 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections. 



196. 
Substructure 
of 
3 
virtual 
strings. 
Hypergravity. 
Big 
Bang 
To 
consider 
leptons 
or 
quarks 
to 
be 
simple 
particles 
with 
no 
structure 
is 
to 
accept 
the 
existence 
of 
point-particles, 
with 
0 
spatial 
dimensions, 
1(0+1) 
in 
space-time. 
We 
insisted 
before, 
in 
our 
world, 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
particles, 
different 
from 
our 
Universe 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
to 
exist. 
We 
accept 
that 
the 
fundamental 
string 
(1+1) 
is 
the 
basic 
entity 
of 
space. 
But 
we 
live 
in 
a 
world 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
so 
each 
particle 
has 
a 
substructure 
of 
3 
virtual 
strings. 


String 
theory 
already 
considers 
a 
three-string 
vertex, 
based 
on 
two 
multiplications 
and 
one 
integration, 
and 
also 
uses 
symmetry 
in 
order 
to 
treat 
the 
3 
strings. 
(Remember 
the 
figure 
about 
the 
distribution 
of 
quarks 
inside 
a 
proton 
or 
a 
neutron). 
Returning 
to 
strings 
(prequarks), 
two 
of 
the 
segments 
are 
consequence 
of 
multiplications 
and 
the 
third 
is 
a 
result 
of 
integration 
of 
a 
symmetric 
expression. 
There 
is 
a 
significant 
curvature 
at 
the 
interaction 
point; 
even 
if 
in 
two 
dimensions 
(like 
our 
apparent 
space, 
it 
is 
almost 
flat 
everywhere). 
If 
we 
adapt 
this 
concept 
to 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
the 
cosingularity 
with 
Planck 
length 
in 
each 
of 
the 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
is 
this 
interaction 
“point”, 
better 
yet, 
it 
is 
a 
“dot”, 
because 
from 
the 
moment 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
graphical 
interaction, 
there 
exists 
at 
least 
one 
spatial 
dimension; 
in 
our 
case, 
three 
spatial 
dimensions. 
This 
dot 
is 
like 
a 
germ, 
with 
a 
tendency 
to 
stretch. 



This 
process 
is 
true 
in 
cosmic 
space 
and 
in 
the 
hidden 
space 
of 
particles. 
Planck 
length 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
has 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
with 
a 
big 
curvature, 
applied 
by 
a 
kind 
of 
“hypergravity”, 
where 
all 
the 
four 
forces 
have 
the 
same 
value, 
and 
this 
is 
inherent 
to 
any 
structure 
of 
matter, 
even 
in 
particles. 
but 
before 
the 
first 
chronos, 
there 
exists 
a 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
completely 
flat, 
like 
a 
vacuum 
with 
limits, 
with 
no 
movement, 
only 
a 
tendency 
to 
it. 
The 
interaction 
point 
is 
a 
"germ", 
always 
in 
three 
dimensions, 
but 
virtual 
and 
without 
borders, 
whose 
size 
of 
influence 
is 
λp 
for 
each 
dimension. 
And 
this 
is 
inherent 
to 
any 
structure 
of 
matter, 
including 
particles. 
In 
the 
Universe, 
expanding 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
way, 
the 
big 
curvature 
at 
the 
beginning 
quickly 
converts 
into 
an 
asymptotic 
flat 
space. 
But 
we 
know, 
in 
our 
world, 
space 
has 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
the 
tendency 
to 
expand 
and 
the 
way 
to 
do 
this 
is 
in 
only 
these 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
(six 
directions). 
For 
that 
reason 
all 
the 
particles 
in 
our 
Universe, 
like 
any 
object, 
including 
black 
holes 
have 
this 
interaction 
“point” 
of 
Planck 
length, 
and 
any 
object 
could 
theoretically 
be 
divided 
until 
this 
interaction 
“point” 
in 
three 
spatial 
dimensions 
is 
reached. 
And 
so, 
the 
Big 
Bang 
can 
be 
found 
anywhere 
in 
our 
Universe. 
In 
the 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
when 
the 
Universe 
is 
stopped 
for 
a 
“while”, 
a 
cubic 
form, 
with 
Planck 
length, 
constitutes 
the 
fundamental 
support 
of 
our 
Universe, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
a 
brick 
in 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
Universe. 
This 
was 
clarified 
before. 
Particles 
have 
their 
own 
expansion, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
their 
own 
lengths. 
Nevertheless, 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
the 
corresponding 
mass 
of 
a 
particle, 
the 
radius 
is 
not 
used, 
but 
its 
collision 
distance, 
its 
Higgs 
length. 
Getting 
the 



mass 
of 
the 
field 
and 
dividing 
by 
some 
factors 
is 
how 
we 
obtain 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
particles. 
To 
visualize 
the 
Y 
or 
form, 
like 
the 
helixes 
of 
an 
electric 
fan, 
we 
can 
see 
them 
only 
when 
the 
fan 
is 
off. 
When 
it 
is 
moving, 
the 
helixes 
move 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
see 
them. 
We 
can 
only 
see 
the 
point 
of 
integration, 
its 
vertex. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
known 
particles 
have 
relation 
with 
λ 
of 
the 
field 
of 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
even 
if 
the 
correct 
relation 
is 
with 
Planck 
length; 
both 
lengths 
are 
already 
related 
in 
a 
simple 
relation: 


λ 
field 
of 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
= 
√(λp) 


That 
gives 
an 
erroneous 
conclusion 
that 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
all 
particles 
of 
matter, 
when 
the 
correct 
relation 
of 
the 
masses 
are 
obtained 
from 
their 
lengths, 
according 
to 
the 
parameter: 


3.5178x10-38/λ=mass 
in 
grams 
or 
1.9392x10-14/λ=mass 
in 
GeV 


As 
we 
mentioned 
several 
times 
in 
former 
sections, 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
only 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
force: 
W+, 
W-, 
Z0. 
The 
photon 
is 
always 
a 
massless 
particle; 
and 
particles 
of 
matter 
always 
have 
masses, 
according 
to 
their 
corresponding 
λ. 



197. 
Gravitational 
and 
electromagnetic 
waves 
moving 
at 
c 
Gravitational 
waves 
and 
electromagnetic 
waves 
always 
move 
at 
the 
same 
speed, 
c, 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum. 
This 
is 
2.99792458x1010 
cm/s. 
For 
that 
reason 
we 
use 
c 
instead 
of 
v 
when 
we 
are 
calculating 
the 
masses 
of 
particles 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe. 
In 
both 
cases, 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
waves. 
We 
use 
both 
formulas: 
For 
mass 
of 
fundamental 
particles: 


ℏ/cλ=m 


λ: 
the 
wavelength 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field. 


For 
cosmic 
matter: 
(Rc2)/G≅M 


Where 
R 
means 
the 
gravitational 
wave 
of 
the 
Universe, 
or 
gravitational 
radius, 
and 
it 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
product 
ct 
(speed 
of 
light 
times 
time). 
But 
what 
happens 
in 
the 
real 
world, 
when 
all 
the 
matter 
moves 
at 
velocities 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light? 
There 
exist 
three 
kinds 
of 
waves: 
advanced 
waves, 
retarded 
waves, 
and 
normal 
waves. 
Normal 
waves 
can 
be 
obtained 
by 
the 
sum 
of 
many 
phase 
waves, 
constituted 
by 
the 
exact 
disposition 
of 
advanced 
and 
retarded 
waves, 
giving 
an 
average 
of 
c; 
although, 
in 
many 
cases, 
the 
average 
is 
a 
retarded 
wave, 
never 
an 
advanced 
wave. 
Besides 
that, 
they 
also 
are 
composed 
by 
zero-
mass 
particles 
of 
force, 
called 
luxons, 
that 
always 
travel 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
and 
can 
neither 
be 
accelerated, 
nor 
slowed 
down; 
examples, 
photons 
and 
gravitons. 
In 
cosmic 
space, 
we 
have 
the 
cosmic 
radius, 
stretching 
always 
faster 
than 
light. 
It’s 
a 
kind 
of 
advanced 
wave; 
the 
gravitational 
radius 
works 
like 
a 
normal 
wave, 
ct, 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
the 
formula 
uses 
c 
as 
the 
speed 
considered. 
This 
kind 
of 
radius 
is 
the 
maximum 
distance 
that 
we 
can 
observe 
with 
the 
current 
technology 
at 
our 
disposal. 
It 
is 
logical 
to 
suppose 
(and 
this 
is 
according 
to 
Einstein’s 
special 
theory 
of 
relativity) 
that 
the 
tangible 
objects 



always 
move 
to 
velocities 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
However, 
there 
exists 
a 
quantum 
relation 
using 
particles-antiparticles, 
and 
relating 
them 
with 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
have 
FTL 
waves: 
retarded 
wave 
(particle) 
– 
light 
wave 
(Higgs 
distance) 
– 
advanced 
wave 
(antiparticle). 
Broglie 
described 
that 
there 
exist 
advanced 
and 
retarded 
waves, 
but 
particles 
of 
matter 
and 
aggregated 
matter 
always 
travel 
at 
velocities 
slower 
than 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
our 
Universe. 
In 
former 
sections, 
we 
divided 
the 
gravitational 
force 
acting 
on 
the 
macroscopic 
world 
and 
the 
quantum 
wave, 
fundamental 
in 
quantum 
mechanics, 
acting 
on 
particles; 
and 
both 
acted 
together, 
only 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
Gravitational 
waves 
(real 
gravitons) 
and 
electromagnetic 
waves 
travel 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
This 
is 
true, 
when 
c 
is 
used 
in 
relativistic 
terms. 
But 
in 
macroscopical 
objects, 
considering 
only 
its 
apparent 
velocity 
with 
an 
imaginary 
fixed 
point, 
traveling 
much 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
very 
negligible 
quantic 
effect; 
with 
no 
practical 
application 
in 
reality. 
This 
effect, 
besides 
its 
negligible 
value, 
is 
only 
virtual. 
The 
apparent 
small 
velocity 
of 
the 
macroscopical 
objects, 
subject 
to 
a 
“fixed” 
point, 
doesn’t 
consider 
the 
real 
movement 
of 
the 
macrocosmos, 
and 
for 
that 
reason, 
we 
use 
v 
instead 
of 
c. 
The 
movement 
of 
any 
object 
on 
Earth 
is 
complex. 
Beside 
its 
own 
movement 
considering 
a 
fixed 
point; 
it 
has 
components 
from 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
planet 
around 
its 
axis; 
from 
the 
translation 
around 
the 
sun; 
from 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
sun 
around 
its 
apex 
point 
in 
our 
galaxy, 
from 
the 
movement 
of 
our 
galaxy 
in 
relation 
to 
other 
galaxies, 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
local 
group 
of 
galaxies 
in 
respect 
to 
the 
Universe; 
and 
the 
total 
movement 
of 
our 
Universe. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
velocity 
of 
any 
object 
by 
its 
mass, 
that 
constitutes 
its 
momentum, 
is 
only 
relative. 
The 
real 
movement 
of 
any 
object 
is 
related 
to 
the 
expansion 
of 
space, 
with 
speed 
limit 
c 
(space 
is 
expanding 
faster 
than 
light, 
but 
this 
accelerated 
expansion 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
itself, 
as 
an 
abstract 
entity). 
The 
horizon 
distance 
(refers 
to 
how 
far 
we 
could 
see, 
or 
how 
far 
light 
can 
travel) 
is 
always 
ct. 
Matter 
cannot 
avoid 
this 
limit. 
Moreover, 
ℏ 
is 
used 
in 
particles. 
For 
macrocospical 
objects, 
we 
use 
G. 
If 
we 
use 
ℏ 
in 
macroscopical 
objects, 
even 
using 
velocities 
much 
slower 
than 
c, 
we 
obtain 
absurd 
short 
wavelengths 
and 
high 
frequencies, 
far 
beyond 
the 
most 
energetic 
and 
deadly 
cosmic 
rays. 
If 
we 
use 
c 
instead 
of 
v, 
the 
result 
is 
even 
worse. 
The 
wavelengths 
are 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length, 
and 
in 
consequence, 



are 
unreal, 
or 
at 
least, 
outside 
of 
our 
Universe. 
Besides 
that, 
particles 
of 
matter, 
when 
they 
are 
acting 
like 
particles, 
not 
in 
their 
duality, 
like 
waves, 
especially 
when 
they 
are 
heavier, 
can 
move 
(in 
their 
own 
frame 
of 
reference) 
at 
velocities 
much 
slower 
than 
c. 
In 
some 
cases, 
the 
heaviest 
particles 
can 
have 
gravitational 
effects, 
but 
negligible, 
or 
virtual. 
Real 
gravitons, 
known 
as 
gravitational 
waves, 
need 
to 
travel 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
Some 
real 
gravitational 
effects, 
but 
negligible, 
exist 
only 
in 
the 
heavier 
particles, 
whose 
range 
is 
between 
2.17x10-5 
and 
1x10-7 
grams. 



198. 
Impossibilities 
in 
macroscopical 
time 
travel 
and 
messaging 
Although 
quantum 
mechanics 
determine 
the 
possibility 
of 
time 
travel 
to 
the 
past, 
for 
macrocosmical 
objects, 
it 
is 
physically 
impossible. 
Physical 
time 
traveling 
is 
permitted, 
but 
only 
to 
the 
future. 
It 
is 
enough 
to 
travel 
in 
a 
spacecraft 
at 
fast 
speeds, 
but 
always 
slower 
than 
light, 
and 
you 
will 
automatically 
go 
to 
the 
future 
in 
a 
shorter 
time, 
according 
to 
time 
distortion. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
return 
to 
the 
past 
in 
our 
physical 
body. 
Traveling 
to 
the 
past 
is 
physically 
impossible 
for 
macroscopical 
objects. 
First 
of 
all, 
quantum 
mechanics 
don’t 
apply 
to 
anything 
heavier 
than 
mp 
(Planck 
mass). 
Even 
with 
antiparticles, 
that 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
particles 
traveling 
to 
the 
past 
(and 
that 
means 
traveling 
FTL), 
it’s 
only 
a 
difference 
with 
the 
frame 
of 
reference 
of 
time. 
Unlike 
the 
classical 
world, 
in 
which 
it 
has 
only 
one 
arrow 
of 
time, 
the 
quantum 
world 
is 
described 
with 
two 
arrows 
of 
time, 
in 
a 
CPT 
connection. 
In 
macroscopical 
objects, 
the 
connections 
are 
outside 
of 
our 
world, 
in 
a 
parallel 
Universe, 
which 
is 
impossible 
to 
arrive 
to. 
In 
quantum 
mechanics, 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
exist 
together 
in 
both 
parallel 
universes, 
although 
they 
are 
destroyed 
when 
they 
are 
joined, 
and 
each 
group, 
in 
each 
Universe, 
is 
separated, 
probably 
through 
black 
holes. 
The 
mathematical 
condition 
for 
particles 
to 
travel 
FTL 
(or 
to 
travel 
to 
the 
past) 
is 
only 
to 
travel 
in 
the 
opposite 
temporal 
frame 
of 
reference. 
But 
what 
happens 
with 
waves. 
There 
are 
advanced 
waves, 
faster 
than 
light, 
but 
are 
not 
useful 
to 
carry 
a 
message, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
they 
are 
not 
capable 
of 
being 
used 
as 
an 
FTL 
communication 
medium. 
Each 
advanced 
wave 
exists 
alone 
as 
a 
perfectly 
regular 
sine 
wave. 
According 
to 
its 
cofinite 
extension 
and 
perfect 
monotony 
is 
not 
useful 
to 
send 
any 
message. 
And 
so, 
superluminal 
communication 
is 
discarded. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
group 
wave, 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
many 
waves, 
that 
is 
always 
a 
normal 
wave 
or 
a 
retarded 
wave 
and 
traveling 
as 
a 
short, 
localized 
pocket 
of 
energy 
for 
sending 
a 
message. 


Travel 
to 
the 
past 
with 
our 
physical 
body, 
or 
carrying 
and 
bringing 
information, 
is 
impossible. 
It 
can 
only 
exist 
in 
our 
imagination 
and 
science 



fiction. 
Using 
these 
concepts 
can 
only 
produce 
absurdities 
and 
paradoxes. 



199. 
Traveling 
using 
wormholes 
But 
what 
happens 
if 
we 
travel 
to 
other 
very 
distant 
region 
of 
space 
using 
wormholes 
and 
in 
consequence, 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light? 
We 
could 
arrive 
in 
our 
future, 
but 
it 
would 
be 
the 
present 
in 
the 
new 
frame 
of 
reference. 
But 
wormholes 
exist 
in 
two 
fundamental 
classes: 


a) 
Wormholes 
with 
2λp 
of 
length, 
communicating 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
(λp 
in 
each 
Universe). 
This 
size 
is 
too 
small 
for 
macroscopical 
objects 
(even 
for 
known 
particles) 
and 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
is 
an 
antimatter 
Universe, 
and 
any 
matter 
that 
enters 
it 
would 
be 
destroyed. 
b) 
Wormholes 
smaller 
than 
λp 
and 
in 
consequence, 
with 
no 
physical 
reality. 
Lengths 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length 
would 
only 
be 
accessible 
in 
Universes 
with 
more 
than 
three 
spatial 
dimensions. 
In 
hypothetical 
terms, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
tear 
space 
and 
use 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension. 
From 
these 
bigger 
dimensions, 
our 
travel 
would 
look 
like 
slower 
than 
light, 
but 
it 
would 
be 
FTL 
according 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
our 
Universe. 
For 
that 
reason, 
in 
theory, 
leaping 
across 
light–years 
of 
space, 
and 
without 
exceeding 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
traveling 
a 
longer 
distance 
than 
that 
light 
would 
travel 
in 
the 
same 
time, 
is 
only 
apparent. 
Inside 
this 
wormhole, 
if 
we 
could 
access 
it, 
we 
would 
need 
to 
travel 
FTL, 
because 
the 
new 
dimension 
is 
curled 
up, 
and 
the 
distance 
is 
not 
a 
geodesic, 
but 
a 
cofinite 
ring. 
And 
in 
any 
way, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
access 
these 
wormholes, 
since 
they 
are 
smaller 
that 
λp, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
inexistent 
in 
our 
world. 
The 
solution 
is 
only 
mathematical, 
not 
physical. 

200. 
Curvature 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Different 
kinds 
of 
Universes 
Our 
space 
(3+1) 
began 
with 
a 
big 
curvature 
at 
the 
beginning, 
and 
it 
was 
expanding 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
function 
in 
an 
asymptotic 
way, 
and 
now, 
it 
is 
almost 
flat, 
but 
it 
will 
never 
be 
flat. 
This 
curvature, 
even 
if 
right 
now 
is 
negligible, 
indicates 
the 
existence 
of 
at 
least 
another 
spatial 
dimension. 
How 
many 
dimensions 
are 
there? 
A 
lot, 
but 
defined 
in 
ordered 
and 
coherent 
ways, 
forming 
different 
and 
similar 
moduli. 
Each 
modulus, 
is 
formed 
by 
8 
dimensions 
(7+1); 
each 
dimension 
with 
a 
minimum 
and 
maximum 
limit. 
The 
minimum 
limit 
is 
longer 
when 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
is 
smaller, 
but 
also, 
the 
distance 
between 
two 
points 
is 
shorter, 
when 
the 
number 
of 
dimensions 
increases. 


The 
smallest 
number 
of 
dimensions 
is 
(0+1) 
and 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
Universe 
is 
practically 
a 
monopole 
(+). 
This 
“particle” 
wouldn’t 
be 
divisible, 
and 
so, 
the 
whole 
Universe 
would 
be 
a 
monopole. 
A 
parallel 
Universe 
exists 
with 
this 
Universe, 
with 
an 
opposite 
time, 
and 
the 
same 
size, 
constituting 
one 
antimonopole 
(-). 
The 
size 
of 
this 
Universe 
and 
antiuniverse 
would 
be 
1.036359701 
cm 
each. 
We 
will 
explain 
this 
with 
more 
detail 
in 
further 
sections. 
Space-time 
is 
quantified, 
and 
so, 
a 
continuum 
always 
has 
a 
“thickness”. 
It 
isn’t 
null 
in 
respect 
to 
another 
Universe 
with 
n+1 
dimensions. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
can 
see 
“shadows” 
or 
two-spatial-dimensional 
Universes, 
and 
four-spatial 
dimensions 
entities 
(if 
they 
exist) 
could 
detect 
our 
presence. 
Each 
“thickness” 
has 
a 
corresponding 
Planck 
length, 
different 
in 
each 
dimension, 
equivalent 
to 
1.173487998x10-11 
(the 
size 
of 
the 
string) 
to 
the 
(n) 
power 
(the 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions), 
and 
so, 
each 
Planck 
would 
be: 
(length 
of 
string)n. 
In 
that 
way, 
our 
Universe 
has 
a 
Planck 
of 
(1.173487998x10-11)3 
= 
1.615979906x10-33 
cm. 
Besides 
that, 
even 
if 
the 
Universe 
is 
almost 
flat 
and 
the 
Big 
Bang 
was 
a 
smooth 
expansion, 
some 
irregularities 
still 
exist 
(galaxies 
clumped 
in 
super 
clusters); 
even 
most 
of 
space 
is 
“empty” 
space. 
The 
irregularities 
can 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
At 
the 
very 
beginning, 
the 
quantum 
gravitational 
force 
had 
the 
same 



strength 
as 
the 
other 
three, 
and 
quantum 
fluctuations 
acted 
in 
the 
Universe 
as 
a 
whole. 
After 
that, 
quantum 
mechanics, 
acts 
fundamentally 
in 
particles; 
and 
gravitation 
basically 
acts 
in 
macroscopical 
objects. 



201. 
End 
of 
the 
Universe 
For 
cosmologists 
and 
theoretical 
physicists, 
it 
is 
a 
certainty 
that 
the 
Universe 
will 
die 
in 
a 
determined 
moment. 
It 
is 
impossible 
for 
it 
to 
live 
forever, 
if 
the 
Big 
Bang 
had 
a 
beginning. 
The 
only 
discussion 
is 
how 
will 
the 
death 
of 
our 
Universe 
be? 
If 
Earth 
dies, 
a 
future 
human 
civilization 
can 
travel 
to 
other 
planets 
to 
avoid 
its 
main 
destiny. 
If 
our 
sun 
dies, 
maybe 
with 
better 
technology, 
we 
will 
be 
able 
to 
travel 
to 
other 
planets 
on 
a 
different 
star. 
If 
the 
Milky 
Way 
has 
problems 
with 
life, 
in 
a 
more 
distant 
future, 
with 
even 
bigger 
development, 
we 
could 
travel 
to 
other 
galaxy. 
The 
only 
problem 
here 
is 
the 
technology 
at 
our 
disposal, 
but 
these 
three 
possibilities 
are 
not 
forbidden. 
But 
what 
can 
humans 
do, 
to 
avoid 
the 
death 
of 
our 
Universe 
as 
a 
whole? 
The 
answer 
is 
nothing, 
at 
least 
in 
our 
physical 
existence. 
To 
use 
another 
dimension 
has 
a 
real 
limitation. 
First 
of 
all, 
wormholes 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
travel 
to 
bigger 
dimensions 
are 
smaller 
than 
our 
Planck 
length, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
access 
them. 
In 
the 
final 
moments 
of 
the 
collapse 
of 
our 
Universe, 
the 
modulus 
will 
open, 
tearing 
the 
fabric 
of 
space, 
and 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
will 
begin 
to 
appear. 
That 
will 
be 
a 
cosmic 
cataclysm, 
and 
the 
whole 
Universe 
will 
collapse 
chaotically. 
The 
fourth 
spatial 
dimension 
will 
begin 
to 
grow 
and 
our 
third 
spatial 
dimension 
in 
its 
maximum 
size 
will 
begin 
to 
decrease. 
All 
space-time 
will 
be 
cracked, 
and 
all 
the 
spatial 
tridimensional 
entities, 
practically 
all 
of 
our 
Universe, 
with 
its 
entire 
physical 
context, 
will 
be 
destroyed 
and 
crushed. 
To 
use 
other 
dimensions 
for 
travel 
has 
another 
limitation: 
In 
higher-
dimensional 
Universes 
our 
physical 
entity 
cannot 
survive. 
And 
there 
is 
no 
physical 
solution 
for 
that. 
Abstract 
entities 
could 
survive, 
only 
if 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
save 
our 
minds 
and 
our 
feelings, 
and 
have 
an 
existence 
outside 
of 
our 
physical 
body. 


But 
the 
time 
of 
destruction 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
far 
away. 
We 
live 
according 
to 
arithmetical 
time, 
and 
in 
logarithmic 
time 
that 
our 
Universe 
uses, 
the 
following 
very 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
it, 
is 
more 
than 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
the 
time 
that 
has 
passed. 
Even 
if 
the 
Universe 
has 
a 
remaining 
minimal 
fraction 
left, 
this 
would 
still 
be 
billions 
or 
even 
trillions 
of 
years. 



202. 
Stability 
of 
proton. 
Unstable 
heavy 
proton 
In 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
SU(3) 
symmetry 
rotates 
three 
quarks, 
and 
under 
certain 
conditions, 
a 
quark 
can 
turn 
into 
one 
of 
the 
other 
quarks. 
However, 
quarks 
cannot 
turn 
into 
electrons 
or 
neutrinos. 
The 
limit 
of 
SU(3) 
is 
k-12π, 
the 
field 
energy 
with 
λ 
≅ 
4.02x10-17 
(√(λp)). 
Into 
the 
range 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model, 
the 
normal 
proton 
is 
permanently 
stable, 
but 
GUT 
theory 
uses 
SU(5) 
symmetry, 
and 
there 
are 
five 
particles 
than 
can 
rotate 
into 
others: 
three 
quarks, 
the 
electron, 
and 
the 
neutrino. 
In 
other 
terms, 
the 
proton 
would 
be 
unstable. 
But 
what 
kind 
of 
proton? 
GUT 
energy 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
around 
2.22x1016 
GeV, 
and 
its 
λ 
≅ 
8.7x10-31 
cm, 
and 
in 
this 
energy, 
normal 
protons 
don’t 
exist 
and 
neither 
do 
massless 
protons 
(particles 
of 
matter 
without 
masses 
are 
against 
the 
uncertainty 
principle), 
and 
besides 
that, 
the 
λ 
of 
the 
collision 
distance 
of 
a 
single 
normal 
proton 
is 
considerably 
much 
longer 
than 
all 
the 
visible 
Universe 
that 
existed 
during 
that 
time. 
An 
unstable 
heavy 
partner 
of 
proton 
is 
necessary 
to 
be 
considered. 
Around 
GUT 
energy, 
the 
heavy 
proton 
decays 
in 
shorter 
time 
than 
the 
time 
the 
normal 
proton 
is 
supposed 
to 
decay. 
However, 
the 
heavy 
proton, 
existing 
in 
a 
period 
of 
large 
density, 
with 
an 
enormous 
gravity, 
almost 
like 
in 
the 
center 
of 
a 
black 
hole, 
has 
a 
big 
time 
distortion 
in 
its 
own 
frame 
of 
reference 
(faster 
speeds 
and 
bigger 
gravities 
causes 
time 
contraction) 
and 
so, 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
heavy 
proton 
is 
longer 
in 
normal 
time. 
But 
eventually, 
heavy 
protons 
will 
decay 
into 
heavy 
positrons, 
heavy 
neutrinos, 
and 
heavy 
antineutrinos. 
Heavy 
neutrons 
are 
also 
unstable 
and 
decay 
into 
heavy 
protons, 
heavy 
electrons, 
and 
heavy 
antineutrinos. 
The 
existence 
of 
heavy 
leptons 
is 
obtained 
first, 
by 
the 
decay 
of 
heavier 
neutrons 
and 
protons. 
Later 
when 
the 
Higgs 
field 
arrives 
at 
k-20π 
(around 
10-28cm), 
heavy 
electrons 
and 
heavy 
positrons 
will 
begin 
to 
appear; 
and 
even 
later, 
in 
a 
longer 
space, 
relatively 
lighter 
particles, 
heavier 
neutrinos 
will 
appear 
from 
k-18π, 
k-16π 
to 
k-12π, 
where 
the 
LHP 
(lightest 
heavy 
partner), 
the 
supposed 
neutronio, 
appears 
at 
331.55 
GeV, 
approximately 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
field, 
and 
132.27 
GeV, 
the 
approximate 
mass 
of 
this 
neutral 
particle. 



Even 
if 
GUT 
energy 
is 
defined 
at 
tremendous 
energy, 
the 
gravitational 
effect 
will 
appear 
at 
an 
even 
larger 
energy, 
but 
GUT 
is 
close 
to 
it. 
Moreover, 
GUT 
theory 
also 
considers 
the 
presence 
of 
three 
families 
of 
particles. 
If 
the 
energy 
is 
enormous, 
the 
resulting 
particles 
would 
be 
heavier. 
The 
heavy 
scale 
is 
demonstrated 
once 
more 
with 
another 
three 
families 
of 
particles. 



203. 
Gates 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
If 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
everywhere 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
connected 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
billions 
upon 
billions 
of 
connecting 
gates 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
exist, 
and 
not 
billions 
of 
billions 
of 
different 
parallel 
Universes. 
But 
the 
size 
of 
this 
kind 
of 
wormholes 
is 
too 
small 
to 
permit 
human 
travel, 
with 
2λp, 
λp 
on 
each 
Universe. 
Besides 
that, 
our 
twin 
Universe 
is 
formed 
by 
antimatter, 
and 
this 
condition 
reinforces 
the 
impossibility 
for 
human 
travel 
by 
using 
them. 
But, 
with 
Planck 
length 
size, 
it 
would 
be 
physically 
possible 
to 
access 
them. 
We 
mentioned 
before, 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
is 
the 
deposit 
of 
our 
waste 
(antimatter), 
and 
in 
an 
interchange, 
both 
Universes 
change 
waste 
in 
an 
exact 
quantity. 
We 
receive, 
in 
compensation, 
the 
waste 
of 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
(our 
matter), 
increasing 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
using 
wormholes 
by 
means 
of 
black 
holes. 
Any 
black 
hole 
in 
our 
Universe 
is 
attached 
to 
another 
black 
hole 
in 
our 
twin 
Universe. 
The 
symmetry 
is 
exact; 
the 
interchange 
of 
matter 
needs 
to 
be 
in 
exact 
equilibrium. 
For 
that 
reason, 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
needs 
to 
be 
a 
twin 
Universe. 
Using 
another 
kind 
of 
wormholes, 
in 
multidimensional 
travel 
is 
impossible. 
FTL 
or 
sub-Planck 
distances 
are 
outside 
of 
our 
physical 
Universe; 
and 
in 
consequence, 
impossible 
to 
reach 
for 
any 
physical 
entity, 
including 
the 
human 
body. 
We 
insist, 
in 
our 
Universe 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
all 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
and 
aggregated 
matter 
that 
live 
in 
it 
need 
to 
inherit 
the 
same 
dimensions 
of 
that 
space 
and 
its 
same 
symmetry. 
Traveling 
in 
the 
multidimensional 
modulus, 
existing 
in 
compactified 
modulus 
space 
is 
physically 
impossible. 
The 
fundamental 
effect 
that 
made 
the 
acceptance 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
billions 
upon 
billions 
of 
parallel 
Universes 
was 
leaving 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
as 
zero. 
But, 
like 
we 
mentioned 
before, 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
was 
never 
zero. 
It 
is 
not 
zero 
and 
will 
never 
be 
zero; 
and 
that 
cofinite 
quantity 
of 
parallel 
Universes 
doesn’t 
exist, 
only 
the 
quantity 
of 
gates 
to 
one 
parallel 
Universe 
does. 



204. 
Prequarks 
and 
three 
virtual 
strings. 
Gravity 
and 
hypergravity 
In 
former 
sections, 
we 
referred 
to 
prequarks 
and 
in 
consequence, 
three 
virtual 
strings, 
representing 
the 
three 
degrees 
of 
freedom 
that 
form 
any 
fundamental 
particle. 
Those 
three 
virtual 
strings 
are 
formed 
in 
the 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
with 
λp 
each. 
When, 
at 
the 
very 
beginning, 
in 
the 
first 
chronos, 
a 
spherical 
Big 
Bang 
is 
formed, 
mass 
appears, 
and 
the 
constants 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c 
are 
established. 
The 
space 
in 
all 
three 
dimensions 
begins 
to 
stretch; 
movement 
appears 
and 
the 
accelerating 
expansion 
acts. 
Using 
considerable 
pressure, 
an 
enormous 
gravitational 
force, 
or 
colossal 
energy, 
we 
could 
see 
these 
“strings", 
united 
in 
their 
point 
of 
interaction, 
but 
we 
could 
never 
see 
them 
as 
free 
particles. 
A 
similar 
procedure 
is 
obtained 
with 
quarks 
and 
electrons. 
If 
quarks 
have 
never 
been 
directly 
observed 
as 
free 
particles, 
that 
don’t 
mean 
they 
don't 
exist. 
Quarks 
will 
always 
be 
confined, 
and 
will 
never 
be 
in 
isolation. 
Besides 
that, 
electrons 
can 
only 
be 
observed 
indirectly, 
by 
the 
side 
effects 
they 
cause. 
Prequarks, 
like 
quarks, 
have 
to 
exist 
only 
inside 
particles, 
not 
in 
isolation; 
prequarks 
inside 
quarks 
and 
leptons; 
and 
quarks, 
inside 
mesons 
and 
hadrons. 
In 
both 
cases, 
it 
is 
only 
a 
question 
of 
the 
energy, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
its 
λ. 
Prequarks, 
like 
quarks, 
can 
never 
be 
in 
isolation. 
But 
they 
have 
another 
property. 
When 
the 
fundamental 
particles 
are 
in 
movement, 
and 
the 
energy 
is 
less 
than 
Planck, 
the 
prequarks, 
like 
virtual 
strings, 
practically 
“disappear”, 
integrating 
themselves 
into 
the 
movement. 
The 
only 
solution 
to 
see 
them 
is 
to 
get 
to 
distances 
close 
to 
λp, 
where 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
see 
a 
Planck 
unit, 
stopped, 
or 
almost 
stopped, 
and 
to 
see 
the 
three 
prequarks 
united 
in 
a 
real 
“point 
of 
interactions”. 
The 
force 
that 
joins 
them 
is 
the 
force 
of 
gravity 
at 
Planck 
length, 
a 
“hyperforce”. 



This 
process 
is 
reversible. 
When 
the 
particle 
is 
stopped 
again, 
the 
three 
strings 
appear, 
because 
they 
have 
also 
3 
degrees 
of 
freedom, 
and 
this 
unit 
never 
disappears 
in 
our 
Universe. 



205. 
Spherical 
"volume" 
and 
spatial 
dimensions 
In 
our 
Universe 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
we 
consider 
a 
sphere. 
But 
a 
corresponding 
“sphere” 
is 
obtained 
by 
the 
number 
of 
the 
spatial 
dimensions 
involved. 
Mathematics 
indicates 
us 
which 
are 
the 
formulas 
needed 
to 
obtain 
this 
spherical 
“volume”. 


(πn/2/(n/2)!) 
rn 
If 
the 
spatial 
dimensions 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
even. 
2nπ(n-1)/2(n-1/2)!/n! 
rn 
if 
the 
spatial 
dimension 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
odd. 


According 
to 
the 
spatial 
dimensions 
involved 
in 
a 
dimensional 
modulus 
the 
formulas 
are 
the 
following: 




We 
observe 
that 
outside 
0 
and 
1 
dimension; 
all 
the 
volumes: 
“volume” 
(2); 
volume 
(3) 
and 
hypervolumes 
(more 
than 
3) 
exhibit 
a 
curvature, 
impossible 
to 
fill 
space 
completely 
if 
they 
are 
piled 
up 
together, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
use 
straight 
objects, 
in 
a 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
where 
the 
evolution 
of 
space 
is 
stopped, 
in 
the 
period 
when 
the 
inflection 
point 
is 
obtained. 
This 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
also 
exists 
anywhere 
in 
our 
Universe, 
and 
it 
acts 
as 
its 
support. 
It 
never 
disappears, 
and 
so, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
go 
to 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
particles 
to 
reproduce 
the 
instant 
moment 
of 
their 
creation, 
or 
just 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Universe, 
a 
way 
for 
the 
microcosmos 
to 
return 
to 
the 
past 
using 
powerful 
particle 
colliders. 
We 
observe 
that 
in 
a 
Universe 
with 
zero 
spatial 
dimensions, 
its 
division 
of 
Universe 
into 
smaller 
pieces 
is 
not 
possible. 
This 
Universe 
is 
like 
a 
(only 
one) 
monopole 
and 
with 
an 
antimonopole 
partner 
in 
a 
parallel 
Universe. 
A 
hypothetical 
division 
of 
this 
Universe 
would 
produce 
a 
lot 
of 
virtual 
monopoles. 
Notwithstanding, 
an 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe 
exists, 
changing 
its 
size, 
according 
to 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
quantum 
fluctuations, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
time 
correction 
factor, 
where 
time 
is 
converted 
into 
inverse 
space, 
equivalent 
to 
e+1/28 
cm 
and 
e-2/28, 
which 
we 
detailed 
before. 
One 
spatial 
dimension 
Universe 
is 
formed 
by 
normal 
strings, 
straight 
lines, 
and 
this 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
typical 
pieces 
for 
the 
foundation 
of 
that 
Universe, 
where 
gravity 
doesn’t 
change 
with 
distance, 
and 
in 
that 
position, 
it 
would 
always 
be 
constant. 
Since 
the 
two 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe, 
there 
has 
been 
gravity 
that 
varies 
according 
to 
distance. 
Each 
n 
Universe, 
divides 
by 
dn-1 
distances, 
and 
so, 
if 
2 
spatial 
Universe 
is 
divided 
by 
d; 
3 
is 
by 
d2; 
4 
by 
d3 
and 
so 
forth. 
In 
that 
scenario, 
the 
curvature 
of 
this 
Universe 
always 
changes, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
use 
them 
as 
the 
“foundations” 
of 
the 
Universe, 
repeating 
them. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
use 
the 
“straight 
form” 
of 
any 
particular 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
However, 
a 
quantitative 
relation 
between 
the 
spherical 
“volume” 
and 
“straight 
volume” 
exists, 
considering 
that 
like 
the 
“packaged 
fraction” 
continues 
to 
decrease 
until 
the 
maximum 
spatial 
dimension 
of 
the 
modulus. 
(7). 
8 
is 
the 
maximum 
dimension 
of 
a 
modulus, 
7 
space 
plus 
1 
time). 
However 
more 
dimensions 
exist, 
but 
they 
appear, 
considering 
n(8) 
as 
a 
hidden 
dimensions 
moduli 
and 
having 
the 
difference 
(valence) 
as 
its 
specific 
kind 
of 
Universe. 



206. 
Fraction 
of 
package 
of 
the 
Universes 
All 
Universes 
are 
repetitive 
copies, 
but 
with 
some 
differences, 
specifically 
according 
to 
different 
spin 
partners 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
new 
additional 
particles. 
The 
formulas 
of 
the 
spherical 
“volume” 
have 
been 
detailed; 
and 
according 
to 
the 
specific 
formulas 
for 
straight 
volumes, 
we 
have: 



If 
we 
consider 
this 
fraction 
of 
package 
in 
our 
Universe: 


(4/3 
πR3)/(8R3)=π/6=0.523598775 
Considering 
the 
space 
correction 
factor, 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections, 
of 
-18/28 
we 
obtain 
a 
similar 
fraction, 
even 
if 
it’s 
only 
approximated: 


e-18/28=0.525788024. 
The 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
factors 
is 
only 
0.41637%. 


We 
explained 
before 
these 
two 
kinds 
of 
presentations 
of 
the 
pre-Big 
Bang; 
the 
straight 
figure 
(a 
cube) 
as 
the 
fundamental 
brick 
of 
the 
foundation 
of 
our 
Universe, 
and 
the 
spherical 
form, 
when 
the 
Universe 
begins 
to 
expand 
in 
an 
accelerated 
way, 
giving 
the 
initial 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
and 
the 
fundamental 
constants 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c, 
and 
the 
secondary 
measures 
start 
to 
develop. 
In 
two 
or 
more 
spatial 
dimensions, 
the 
circular 
form 
cannot 
fill 
the 
whole 
space, 
straight 
lines 
are 
necessary, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
hyperbola 
(2) 
or 
hyperboloids 
of 
3 
more 
dimensions, 
need 
a 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
with 
straight 
lines. 



207. 
Time 
symmetrical 
dynamical 
determinism 
We 
know 
that 
dynamics 
is 
a 
specification 
of 
how 
a 
physical 
system 
will 
develop 
through 
time, 
given 
the 
physical 
conditions 
of 
the 
system 
at 
one 
particular 
time. 
For 
when 
mathematics 
are 
referred, 
it 
is 
feasible 
to 
consider 
any 
specific 
condition 
at 
some 
remote 
future, 
and 
evolve 
backwards 
in 
time. 
Or 
inversely, 
the 
final 
or 
any 
intermediate 
conditions 
depend 
on 
the 
initial 
ones, 
determining, 
in 
both 
cases, 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
system. 
This 
relation 
is 
called 
time-symmetrical 
dynamical 
determinism. 
In 
the 
Universe, 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
at 
the 
very 
beginning; 
in 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information, 
the 
whole 
tendency 
for 
future 
evolution 
is 
marked; 
the 
conceptual 
laws 
have 
been 
regulated 
and 
the 
initial 
conditions 
will 
rule 
the 
dynamic 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe. 
This 
basic 
information, 
fundamentally 
important, 
will 
never 
be 
destroyed 
during 
the 
life 
of 
our 
Universe. 
Since 
Planck 
length 
is 
impossible 
to 
decrease, 
obtaining 
a 
complete 
evaporation 
of 
a 
black 
hole, 
turning 
the 
“singularity” 
that 
is 
practically 
nothing 
into 
space 
zero 
is 
impossible 
in 
any 
physical 
world. 
The 
minimum 
length 
is 
Planck 
length; 
and 
the 
primordial 
information 
is 
imprinted 
in 
its 
area, 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
is 
never 
destroyed 
until 
the 
final 
time 
of 
our 
Universe. 
Time–reversal 
symmetry 
is 
not 
only 
true 
for 
classical 
mechanics, 
but 
it 
is 
also 
true 
for 
the 
sub-microscopic 
dynamics 
of 
the 
microcosmos, 
including 
the 
individual 
particles. 
According 
to 
quantum 
mechanics, 
the 
position 
and 
momentum 
of 
a 
particle 
can 
never 
be 
exactly 
detailed; 
but 
this 
is 
unnecessary 
for 
the 
overall 
behavior 
of 
the 
system. 
The 
general 
information, 
fixed 
in 
the 
first 
unit 
of 
information, 
is 
enough 
to 
determine 
the 
dynamical 
behavior 
of 
the 
system, 
in 
this 
case, 
our 
Universe. 



208. 
Discontinuity 
in 
energy 
and 
matter 
Although 
nature 
abhors 
vacuum; 
neither 
matter 
nor 
energy 
are 
continuos. 
Visible 
spaces 
exist; 
apparently 
empty 
among 
the 
different 
“pieces” 
of 
them. 
And 
this 
is 
true 
in 
the 
microscopical 
as 
in 
the 
macroscopical 
world. 
Examples: 
Photons: 
little 
bundles 
or 
“quanta” 
of 
light 
(light 
is 
then, 
lumpiness 
energy). 
Graviton: 
smallest 
bundles 
of 
the 
gravitational 
force 
field. 
ℏ: 
Planck 
constant 
is 
the 
fundamental 
parameter 
in 
quantum 
mechanics. 
It 
determines 
the 
size 
of 
the 
discrete 
units 
of 
different 
measures, 
into 
which 
the 
microscopic 
world 
is 
divided. 
Space 
and 
time 
are 
not 
continuous. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
access 
distances 
shorter 
than 
λp 
(approx. 
1.616x10-33 
cm) 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
minimum 
fraction 
of 
time 
is 
(approx. 
5.39x10-44 
s). 
All 
matter 
(and 
energy) 
in 
the 
macrocosmos, 
as 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
worlds, 
have 
a 
sequence 
of 
concentration 
and 
“empty” 
space. 
An 
atom 
for 
example, 
has 
more 
than 
99.9% 
of 
its 
mass 
inside 
a 
nucleus 
(center); 
whose 
radius 
is 
105 
less 
than 
the 
size 
of 
atom. 
The 
electrons 
revolve 
around 
the 
nucleus 
at 
velocities 
near 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
“filling” 
the 
space 
with 
electromagnetic 
energy 
that 
seems 
as 
solid 
chunks 
of 
matter. 
Electrons 
revolve 
around 
the 
nucleus 
in 
orbitals. 
Planets 
revolve 
around 
the 
sun 
in 
orbits, 
all 
of 
them 
mathematically 
constituted. 
Between 
orbitals 
or 
orbits 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
electrons 
or 
planets 
to 
exist. 
The 
same 
rule 
applies 
even 
when 
increasing 
the 
outer 
space 
or 
decreasing 
the 
inner 
space. 
This 
is 
true 
in 
the 
microscosmos 
as 
in 
the 
macrocosmos. 
But, 
what 
happened 
farther 
away 
from 
our 
Universe? 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
after 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe, 
a 
fractal 
dimension 
exists 
until 
we 
arrive 
to 
the 
four 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe. 
In 
this 
fractal 
space, 
3~4, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
form 
a 
Universe; 
and 
so, 
this 
is 
a 
state 
of 
chaotic 
evolution, 
that 
we 
named 
Big 
Crush. 
But 
what 
happened 
with 
a 
dimensional 
modulus 
of 
8 
Universes 
(7+1)? 
We 
mentioned 
that 
the 
dimensional 
modulus 
is 
formed, 
not 
for 
8 
dimensions, 
but 
for 
28, 
because 
a 
Universe 
has 
the 
same 
footing 
within 
its 
dimensions 
but 
they 
are 
completely 
different 
among 
others, 
and 
so, 
we 
add 



0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28. 
The 
dimensions 
among 
them 
have 
a 
big 
difference, 
and 
it 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
reduce 
it 
using 
logarithmical 
measures. 
A 
dimensional 
modulus, 
in 
arithmetical 
measures, 
has 
an 
enormous 
“empty” 
space 
among 
dimensional 
Universes, 
because 
the 
difference 
between 
one 
dimension 
with 
the 
next 
consecutive 
is 
8.52x1010. 
The 
minimum 
length 
of 
the 
Universe 
of 
strings 
(1+1) 
is 
3.83x1065 
times 
bigger 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Universe 
of 
7-sphere 
(7+1) 
particles. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
draw 
them 
both 
in 
a 
sheet 
of 
paper 
at 
least 
without 
using 
logarithmical 
measures. 
But 
we 
can 
imagine 
that 
between 
a 
Universe 
and 
the 
next, 
there 
is 
an 
enormous 
“empty” 
space; 
and 
also, 
inside 
the 
“sub-Planck” 
spaces 
in 
any 
Universe. 
We 
wrote 
“empty” 
because 
the 
modulus 
is 
filled 
with 
gravitational 
energy, 
measuredly 
and 
different 
in 
any 
Universe, 
but 
also, 
with 
“virtual 
particles” 
of 
the 
next 
dimension. 
The 
energy 
among 
Universes 
is 
gravitational 
because 
the 
gravitational 
force 
is 
the 
only 
force 
that 
unites 
different 
classes 
of 
dimensional 
Universes 
in 
a 
spatial 
modulus; 
and 
we 
suppose 
it 
unites 
different 
moduli 
in 
a 
dimensional 
package; 
and 
different 
packages 
in 
a 
dimensional 
cluster; 
and 
so 
on 
successively. 
This 
tendency 
to 
cofinity 
needs 
to 
end, 
and 
a 
deeper 
study 
is 
necessary. 
As 
we 
said 
before, 
gravity 
is 
the 
only 
force 
between 
dimensional 
Universes, 
but 
not 
the 
feeble 
normal 
gravity 
we 
know. 
It 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
hypergravity 
(we 
didn't 
name 
it 
supergravity 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
confusion 
with 
an 
old 
and 
discarded 
theory). 


For 
that 
reason, 
in 
the 
beginning 
or 
in 
the 
end 
of 
any 
Universe, 
gravity 
is 
united 
with 
the 
other 
forces, 
and 
it 
has 
a 
considerable 
strength. 
It 
acts 
with 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
Higgs 
gravitational 
boson, 
at 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
any 
Big 
Bang 
and 
any 
Big 
Crunch. 
It 
is 
separated 
from 
the 
other 
forces 
almost 
immediately; 
but 
in 
the 
Big 
Crush, 
the 
force 
acts 
permanently 
united, 
but 
the 
time 
here 
is 
even 
more 
limited.

Jumped 
and 
quantified 
space. 
Sequence 
of 
Universes 
If 
our 
Universe 
works 
with 
jumped 
or 
quantified 
space, 
it 
is 
similar 
with 
other 
dimensional 
Universes. 
We 
talked 
about 
a 
dimensional 
modulus 
of 
eight 
dimensions, 
but 
not 
every 
dimension 
can 
form 
Universes. 
Remember, 
physical 
reality 
is 
not 
continuous; 
and 
the 
relation 
with 
Universes 
with 
more 
dimensions 
is 
similar. 
The 
“physical” 
Universes 
began 
with 
1 
dimensional 
Universes. 
(0+1). 
We 
explained 
that 
before. 
A 
zero 
dimensional 
Universe 
(0+0) 
is 
impossible 
to 
exist 
in 
any 
“physical” 
existence. 
It’s 
the 
same 
as 
a 
∞ 
dimensional 
Universe. 
But 
if 
any 
Universe 
works 
with 
jumps, 
not 
all 
dimensions 
can 
form 
Universes. 
The 
modular 
relation 
is 
8 
[(n(n-1))/2]+valence, 
where 
(n) 
is 
the 
dimension, 
beginning 
with 
one 
(1); 
and 
valence 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
space-time 
Universe. 
In 
String 
Universes, 
the 
valence 
is 
two. 
From 
this 
manner, 
even 
using 
all 
the 
consecutive 
numbers, 
beginning 
with 
1, 
instead 
of 
n, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
form 
Universes 
with 
all 
the 
dimensions; 
utilizing 
quantum 
jumps 
(or 
quantum 
gravitational 
jumps 
that 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
the 
same 
thing). 
All 
the 
possible 
Universes, 
always 
united 
in 
a 
modulus, 
are 
related 
to 
the 
former 
formula, 
whose 
summarized 
form 
is: 
4n2 
-4n 
+ 
valence. 
If 
all 
the 
dimensions 
could 
form 
Universes, 
this 
would 
distort 
the 
form 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
Universe 
after 
eight 
would 
be 
the 
continuous 
repetition 
of 
moduli, 
and 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
cofinity. 
A 
hook 
is 
necessary 
with 
the 
next 
group, 
each 
with 
more 
complex 
aggregations, 
whose 
number 
of 
elements 
continues 
to 
diminish. 
A 
cofinite-dimensional 
Universe 
would 
be 
the 
most 
complex 
structure 
possible. 
We 
know 
that 
our 
Universe, 
in 
all 
its 
manifestations, 
including 
the 
macrocosmos 
and 
microcosmos, 
have 
“empty 
space” 
“Empty” 
doesn’t 
mean 
absolute 
vacuum, 
but 
space 
with 
smaller 
energy 
density, 
almost 
zero; 
but 
never 
zero. 
This 
is 
necessary 
in 
any 
“physical” 
world, 
not 
only 
in 
our 
Universe 
of 
3+1 
dimensions, 
but 
in 
every 
Universe, 
from 
one 
space-time 



Universe 
to 
cofinity 
(the 
maximum 
number 
of 
dimensions 
possible). 
The 
first 
modulus, 
or 
fundamental 
Universes, 
is: 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4, 
5, 
6, 
7, 
8 
(in 
space-
time). 
The 
actual 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universes 
(the 
one 
where 
we 
are 
now) 
is 
number 
4. 
We 
have 
named 
all 
of 
them, 
the 
first 
sequence, 
and 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
fundamental 
ingredients 
are: 



The 
second 
sequence 
of 
Universes 
is: 
9, 
10, 
11, 
12, 
13, 
14, 
15, 
16; 
and 
they 
are 
formed 
mainly 
by 
the 
fundamental 
ingredient 
of 
the 
corresponding 
Universe 
of 
the 
first 
sequence; 
but 
they 
could 
have 
secondary 
elements, 
other 
ingredients 
of 
the 
Universes 
of 
the 
first 
sequence, 
due 
to 
fact 
that 
every 
Universe 
of 
the 
second 
sequence 
has 
more 
room 
that 
any 
Universe 
of 
the 
first 
sequence; 
and 
moreover 
(and 
this 
is 
basic), 
they 
have 
the 
first 
modulus 
attached, 
which 
includes 
eight 
dimensional 
Universes. 
Each 
Universe 
of 
the 
first 
modulus 
has 
only 
its 
corresponding 
ingredients. 


Our 
Universe 
with 
valence 
4 
(3+1), 
even 
with 
enough 
room, 
has 
no 
anomalies: 
monopoles; 
or 
cosmic 
strings; 
or 
membranes 
(domain 
walls); 
and 
with 
more 
reason, 
neither 
does 
it 
have 
more 
complex 
particles 
(4, 
5, 
6, 
7-spheres), 
which 
need 
more 
room 
that 
our 
Universe 
has 
available. 


The 
second 
Universe 
of 
our 
sequence 
is 
12, 
and 
in 
that 
Universe, 
the 
particles 
of 
our 
Universe 
will 
exist, 
with 
more 
complex 
particles, 
not 
only 
the 
superpartners, 
but 
also 
massless 
particles 
of 
force 
with 
spin 
greater 
than 
two, 
moreover, 
secondary 
elements 
or 
anomalies, 
and 
fundamental 
ingredients 
of 
all 
the 
Universes 
of 
the 
first 
modulus. 
But 
in 
our 
Universe, 
only 
particles 
(3-sphere) 
exist; 
this 
means, 
particles 
with 
three 
spatial 
dimensions. 


Remember, 
particles 
and 
our 
cosmic 
space 
are 
inherited 
to 
the 
dimensional 



matrix 
of 
our 
Universe, 
the 
(3+1) 
Universe 
in 
its 
first 
dimensional 
modulus. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
sequence 
of 
a 
string 
Universe 
is 
10 
and 
26. 
But 
the 
first 
number 
of 
the 
sequence 
was 
2, 
and 
this 
is 
its 
corresponding 
valence 
to 
all 
the 
sequence 
of 
string 
Universes. 
10 
and 
26 
have 
strings 
as 
the 
fundamental 
elements 
(or 
ingredients). 
But 
with 
1 
or 
3 
active 
moduli 
respectively 
attached 
to 
them, 
They 
can 
have, 
as 
secondary 
elements 
or 
anomalies, 
all 
the 
fundamental 
elements 
of 
the 
first 
modulus, 
including 
monopoles, 
cosmic 
strings, 
domain 
walls, 
and 
our 
particles, 
but 
it 
is 
totally 
different 
to 
include 
our 
Universe 
in 
a 
world 
of 
strings, 
even 
if 
they 
have 
10 
or 
26 
dimensions.

Table 
of 
dimensional 
Universes 
In 
the 
following 
table, 
we 
have 
put 
all 
the 
dimensional 
Universes, 
forming 
the 
moduli 
permitted 
according 
to 
the 
jump 
of 
dimensional 
Universes. 



Note: 
numbers 
in 
bold 
are 
the 
only 
possible 
dimensional 
Universes. 


As 
we 
saw, 
a 
dimensional 
modulus 
has 
8 
dimensional 
Universes; 
but 
seven 
moduli 
form 
a 
dimensional 
package, 
but 
they 
are 
attached 
to 
the 
first 



modulus 
of 
the 
second 
package, 
maintaining 
eight 
physically. 
Permitting 
among 
them, 
a 
lot 
of 
non-valid 
dimensional 
Universes. 
The 
arrows 
on 
the 
former 
table 
indicate 
the 
valid 
sequences. 



The 
number 
of 
possibilities 
for 
more 
complex 
structures 
decreases 
until 
it 



arrives 
to 
the 
cofinite-dimensional 
Universe, 
the 
largest 
dimensional 
structure. 
But 
this 
complex 
structure 
with 
cofinite 
dimensions 
needs 
time 
to 
exist. 
Even 
being 
the 
most 
complex 
structure, 
it 
is 
still 
limited, 
needing 
time 
to 
complete 
itself. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
realize 
this 
in 
a 
deeper 
study.

Code 
of 
string 
Universes 
Returning 
to 
the 
string 
and 
the 
fundamental 
modulus 
with 
eight 
dimensions 
(7+1) 
that 
are 
in 
our 
vicinity, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
easy 
to 
demonstrate, 
equations 
of 
String 
theory 
show 
us 
that 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
string 
are 
10 
and 
26. 
These 
are 
the 
second 
and 
third 
terms 
in 
the 
string 
sequence. 
We 
know 
the 
first 
term 
in 
the 
sequence 
of 
the 
string. 
Its 
fundamental 
nature, 
or 
valence, 
is 
2(1+1). 
The 
general 
formula 
is 
4n2– 
4n 
and 
adding 
2, 
the 
valence 
of 
string, 
gives 
us: 
4n2 
– 
4n 
+ 
2, 
the 
formula 
of 
the 
string. 
Considering 
n= 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 
and 
8, 
we 
have 
the 
string 
sequence: 
2, 
10, 
26, 
50, 
82, 
122, 
170, 
and 
226. 
This 
last 
number 
pertains 
to 
the 
first 
modulus 
of 
the 
second 
package. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
that 
the 
sequence 
can 
be 
also 
obtained 
with: 
1, 
3, 
5, 
7, 
9, 
11, 
13, 
15, 
etc. 
(the 
square 
of 
odd 
numbers, 
plus 
one). 



This 
result 
can 
have 
a 
physical 
interpretation. 
The 
Universes 
with 
physical 
conditions 
for 
the 
development 
of 
intelligent 
life 
need 
to 
have 
odd 
spatial 
dimensions. 
But 
moreover, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
prove 
the 
sequence 
with 
a 
simple 
algebraic 
calculation. 
In 
effect, 
if 
n 
is 
a 
real 
number 
beginning 
with 
1; 
2n-1 
would 
be 
an 
odd 
number, 
beginning 
with 
one. 
Equaling: 
4n2 
– 
4n 
+ 
2 
= 
(2n 
– 
1)2 
+ 
1 
4n2 
– 
4n 
+ 
2 
= 
4n2 
– 
4n 
+ 
2 


The 
String 
Universe, 
like 
our 
Universe, 
has 
an 
odd 
spatial 
dimension 
(even, 
in 
space-time) 
and 
in 
consequence, 
both 
began 
with 
a 
small 
Big 
Bang 
with 
λp1 
and 
λp3 
respectively, 
increasing 
its 
size 
until 
it 
reaches 
a 
cofinite 
expansion; 
and 
according 
to 
the 
physical 
laws, 
have 
the 
physical 
conditions 
for 
a 
plentiful 
development. 
But 
string 
(1+1) 
and 
our 
Universe 
(3+1) 
have 
totally 
different 
physical 
entities. 
String 
is 
a 
world 
of 
strings 
and 
our 
Universe 
is 
a 
world 
of 
particles. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
all 
the 
particles, 
and 
objects 



formed 
by 
them, 
have 
three 
dimensions, 
or 
three 
degrees 
of 
freedom. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
point 
particles 
don’t 
exist; 
neither 
does 
string 
particles 
(with 
1+1 
dimensions). 
The 
spatial 
structure 
was 
formed 
in 
the 
Pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario 
and 
it 
had 
a 
cubic 
form. 
It 
was 
a 
“vacuum 
with 
limits”(with 
size 
λp). 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
Big 
Bang, 
movement 
began. 
The 
cubic 
reached 
a 
big 
curvature, 
mass, 
energy, 
G, 
ℏ, 
c, 
and 
the 
secondary 
measures 
acquired 
their 
values, 
some 
being 
constant 
and 
others, 
variable. 
And 
the 
Universe 
began 
to 
expand 
in 
a 
continuous 
and 
accelerated 
fashion, 
with 
some 
periods 
of 
exponential 
inflation, 
in 
three 
moments 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
era. 


Remember, 
even 
if 
the 
Big 
Bang 
had 
the 
maximum 
energy 
density; 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
greater 
now. 


(But 
there 
is 
no 
net 
change 
of 
energy. 
The 
increase 
of 
the 
positive 
energies 
is 
equilibrated 
by 
the 
increase 
of 
negative 
energy). 
The 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
was: 


(Rc4)/G 
= 
energy 
= 
(1.615979906x10-33

(2.99792458x1010

We 
can

the 
fundamental 
structure 
of 
our 
Universe 
in 
String 
theory, 
forming 
all 
the 
particles 
with 
three

Coherent 
sequences 
of 
Universes. 
Dimensional 
packages 
We 
talked 
about 
the 
jumps 
in 
microcosmos 
and 
the 
macrocosmos. 
Even 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
Universe, 
we 
used 
a 
mathematical 
formula 
to 
form 
the 
different 
dimensional 
moduli 
existing 
in 
a 
dimensional 
package, 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
the 
sequence 
of 
different 
Universes 
with 
dimensions 
1 
to 
8. 
We 
add 
the 
valence 
to 
the 
formula 
(8)(n)(n-1)/2+valence=4n2-4n+valence. 
But 
why? 
Qualitatively, 
we 
accept 
that 
the 
matter 
of 
the 
Universes 
is 
not 
continuous, 
including 
the 
Universes 
themselves; 
in 
that 
way, 
not 
all 
the 
dimensions 
are 
valid 
to 
form 
Universes. 
Quantitatively, 
the 
formula 
gives 
us 
the 
mathematical 
results. 
But 
a 
deeper 
physical 
understanding 
is 
necessary. 
We 
remember 
gravity 
(in 
its 
version 
of 
“hypergravity”) 
is 
the 
force 
that 
unites 
the 
Universes. 
But 
we 
know 
how 
this 
force 
acts 
in 
our 
Universe. 
It 
is 
attractive 
in 
shorter 
distances, 
decreasing 
with 
the 
square 
of 
the 
distance, 
and 
it 
is 
repulsive 
at 
larger 
distances 
(it 
is 
the 
contrary 
to 
the 
nuclear 
strong 
force). 
In 
that 
way, 
applying 
the 
gravitational 
force, 
as 
the 
force 
that 
unites 
or 
separates 
the 
different 
moduli, 
we 
can 
have 
an 
ordered 
and 
coherent 
sequence, 
just 
like 
the 
gravitational 
force. 
If 
we 
draw 
different 
moduli, 
in 
circles, 
only 
to 
order 
them 
as 
an 
example, 
we 
can 
see 
(dark 
circles 
as 
valid 
dimensional 
moduli 
and 
white 
circles 
as 


invalidateddimensionalmoduli).
Near 
is 
attractive, 
begins 
to 
weaken 
with 
the 
distance 
and 
in 
long 
distances, 
the 
force 
is 
repulsive 
or 
we 
can 
say, 
in 
other 
words, 
gravity 
is 
weaker 
the 
greater 
the 
distance. 
The 
dark 
circle 
outside 
the 
dimensional 
package 
is 
the 
first 
modulus 
of 
the 
second 
dimensional 
package. 
The 
number 
of 
dimensions 
of 
a 
dimensional 
package 
is 
224 
(28x8). 
The 
last 
dimension 
of 
string 
is 
226 
(224+valence 
2), 
but 
this 
is 
outside 
the 
first 
dimensional 
package. 
This 
is 



another 
common 
form 
of 
using 
a 
hook 
to 
join 
the 
different 
sections 
of 
a 
Universe 
or 
different 
Universes.

Known 
scale 
and 
separation 
of 
particles 
We 
explained 
before, 
the 
scale 
of 
known 
particles 
is 
derived 
in 
12π 
minus. 
The 
leptons 
are 
six 
(with 
six 
antimatter 
leptons), 
with 
no 
“color”, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
with 
no 
varieties. 
In 
contrary 
sense, 
quarks 
have 
a 
big 
quantity 


each 
family 
with 
, 
and 
their 
corresponding 
antimatter. 
Besides 
that, 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
mesons 
and 
hadrons, 
product 
of 
the 
different 
combinations 
of 
quarks. 
A 
lot 
of 
them 
have 
appeared, 
but 
in 
the 
future, 
more 
will 
appear. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
determine, 
at 
least 
from 
a 
theoretical 
point 
of 
view, 
how 
many 
quarks 
and 
combinations 
are 
there. 
We 
can 
wait 
for 
them 
to 
appear, 
but 
a 
lot 
of 
them 
are 
very 
unstable 
and 
some 
of 
them 
are 
impossible 
to 
exist 
in 
physical 
reality. 
The 
mathematical 
position 
is 
to 
join 
a 
quark– 
antiquark 
pair 
into 
mesons; 
and 
three 
quarks 
or 
three 
antiquarks 
into 
hadrons, 
and 
to 
use 
the 
different 
charges 
±2/3 
and 
±1/3 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
a 
whole 
number: 
0, 
+1, 
and 
-1 
in 
mesons; 
and 
0, 
+1, 
-1, 
+2, 
and 
-2 
in 
hadrons. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
join 
quarks 
of 
different 
families, 
including 
a 
relative 
heavy 
quark 
and 
a 
lighter 
quark. 
In 
this 
position, 
when 
the 
strong 
force 
is 
used, 
there 
exist 
an 
arbitrary 
number 
of 
varieties, 
of 
different 
masses, 
known 
as 
excited 
heavy 
states. 
In 
that 
way, 
each 
excited 
state 
with 
different 
mass, 
even 
with 
the 
same 
quarks, 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
new 
particle. 
This 
is 
specially 
observed 
in 
k-11π, 
which 
is 
the 
field 
of 
c 
and 
s. 


The 
first 
scale 
(the 
only 
one 
in 
the 
Standard 
Model) 
is 
composed 
from 
0π 
to 
-12π 
(we 
explained 
this 
before). 
The 
leptons 
are 
only 
6, 
but 
they 
use 
more 
than 
2/3 
of 
the 
scale; 
longer 
wavelengths 
mean 
lighter 
masses. 
All 
the 
quarks 
(and 
even 
the 
second 
and 
third 
family 
of 
electrons) 
are 
constituted 
in 
the 
last 
circle. 
The 
sequence 
is 
divided 
into 
three 
circles 
of 
4π 
each, 
and 
the 
subdivisions 
are 
(in 
order): 
none, 
2, 
and 
4. 
And 
the 
sequence 
is: 



The 
sequences 
of 
leptons 
are 
constituted 
by 
multiples 
of 
2π; 
but 
the 
sequences 
of 
quarks 
are 
constituted 
by 
π. 
Then, 
the 
circle 
is 
not 
complete, 
and 
in 
that 
way, 
resonances 
and 
excitations 
are 
permitted, 
and 
so, 
a 
big 
variety 
of 
quarks 
and 
their 
compounds 
exist, 
using 
all 
the 
possible 
combinations 
amongst 
quarks.

-9π 
~-12π 
are 
the 
fields 
of 
many 
compounds 
(using 
quarks 
and 
antiquarks) 
and 
the 
electrons 
2 
and 
3. 
Resonances 
exist 
in 
all 
of 
this 
space, 
because 
π 
is 
not 
a 
complete 
frequency 
and 
so, 
they 
have 
interferences 
(resonances), 
where 
the 
factor 
used 
to 
divide 
the 
field 
is 
different. 
This 
is 
not 
an 
impediment, 
but 
gives 
an 
abundance 
of 
particles. 
And 
when 
a 
relatively 
heavy 
quark 
forms 
compounds 
with 
one 
or 
two 
lighter 
quarks, 
excited 
states 
also 
exist, 
with 
different 
masses, 
even 
with 
the 
same 
components.

the 
field 
of

and

and

Most 
of 
the 
particles 
are 
derived 
from 
e-11π, 
where 
the 
strong 
force 
acts. 
In 
e



12π, 
quarks 
act 
using 
the 
electro-weak 
interaction). 


The 
energy 
of 
the 
field 
of 
e-10π 
is 
0.653 
GeV. 
Its 
field 
is 
composed 
by 
four 
π 
mesons 
(pions): 
. 
Each 
individual 
mass 
has 
an 
approximate 
value 
of 
0.653/√(8π)=0.130 
GeV. 
The 
total 
energy 
of 
the 
four 
masses 
in 
e-11π 
is 
11.74 
GeV; 
or 
14.716 
GeV, 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
field. 
Even 
if 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
incorporate 
other 
mesons 
or 
hadrons, 
the 
basic 
ingredients 
are: 
. 
The 
sum 
of 
them 
is 
smaller 
than 
11.74 
GeV, 
but 
we 
need 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
excited 
states 
of 
the 
mesons, 
when 
c, 
as 
a 
heavier 
quark, 
forms 
compounds 
with 
itself 
and 
with 
s 
(also 
possible 
to 
combine 
with 
u 
and 
d). 
The 
studies 
about 
these 
classes 
of 
heavy 
hadrons 
(and 
in 
relative 
minor 
extension, 
heavy 
mesons), 
normally 
composed 
by 
a 
heavy 
quark 
and 
one 
or 
two 
lighter 
quarks, 
have 
a 
long 
extension.

Masses 
of 
known 
quarks 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
book 
is 
not 
to 
detail 
old 
concepts; 
only 
new 
concepts; 
to 
choose 
the 
answer 
of 
doubtful 
items, 
and 
to 
show 
a 
new 
possible 
way 
of 
study. 
It 
not 
only 
contains 
answers, 
but 
also 
tips, 
probabilities, 
and 
possibilities; 
and 
sometimes, 
only 
ideas 
that 
need 
deeper 
studies, 
or 
even, 
some 
of 
them 
to 
be 
discarded. 


Normally 
in 
the 
way 
to 
explain 
new 
concepts, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
detail 
old 
concepts 
as 
a 
small 
introduction, 
or 
to 
repeat 
new 
concepts 
previously 
stated 
in 
this 
book, 
but 
deriving 
them 
to 
new 
and 
different 
perspectives. 
The 
light 
u, 
d, 
and 
s 
quarks 
have 
masses 
that 
are 
small 
in 
comparative 
terms. 
But 
c, 
b, 
and 
t 
have 
“heavy” 
masses, 
even 
bigger 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
scale 
of 
non-perturbative 
strong 
dynamics. 
Examples: 


The 
combination 
has 
two 
states: 
D+ 
=1.87 
GeV 
and 
the 
excited 
state: 
D*+ 
=2.01 
GeV. 
The 
combination 
cuu 
has 
two 
states: 
Σc++=2.45 
GeV 
and 
the 


excited 
state: 
Σc*++=2.52 
GeV. 
The 
combination 
bū 
has 
two 
states, 
=5.28 
GeV 
and 
the 
excited 
state, 
=5.33 
GeV, 
etc. 
There 
are 
other 
combinations, 
heavy 
+ 
light 
mesons, 
like 
c 
and 
s 
with 
more 
than 
two 
states; 
and 
two 
heavy 
with 
more 
than 
four 
excited 
states, 
and 
other 
heavier 
states, 
which 
are 
still 
unknown. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
point 
out 
the 
combination 
of 
c 
and 
s 
and 
their 
corresponding 
antiparticles, 
because 
they 
fix 
the 
k-11π 
field. 
In 
effect: 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
4 
mesons: 
, 
in 
their 
more 
energetic, 
even 
unknown, 
states 
needs 
to 
give 
11.74 
GeV. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
add 
the 
most 
excited 
states 
in 
order 
so 
that 
we 
can 
accommodate 
them, 
and 
also 
all 
the 
ground 
states 
and 
other 
less 
excited 
states. 
Those 
mesons 
are 
the 
fundamental 
units 
in 
the 
k-11π 
field, 
whose 
total 
energy 
is 
equal 
to 
14.716 
GeV. 
However, 
the 
maximum 
total 
of 
the 
four 
masses 
of 
the 
most 
excited 
states 
of 
mesons 
in 
this 
field, 
is 
obtained, 
which 
is 
equivalent 
to: 
(14.716 
GeV/√8π) 
4 
= 
11.74 
GeV. 
k-11π, 
with 
field 
energy 
of 
14.716 
GeV, 
and 
an 
energy 
at 
disposal 
to 
form 
particles 
of 
11.74 
GeV, 
can 
sustain 
any 
mesons 
or 
hadrons, 
whose 
sum 
of 
the 


and

quartet 
is 
heavier 
than 
0.66 
GeV, 
and 
lighter 
than 
11.74 
GeV. 
The 
relation 
is 
obtained 
in 
a 
fractal 
k; 
or 
in 
a 
normal 
k, 
by 
changing 
its 
division 
factor. 



215. 
Energy 
in 
Big 
Bang 
and 
present 
day 
Universe 
In 
a 
system 
with 
constant 
volume 
and 
constant 
mass, 
the 
temperature 
is 
a 
correct 
way 
to 
calculate 
its 
energy; 
higher 
temperature, 
more 
energy. 
However, 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Universe 
as 
a 
whole; 
where 
it 
is 
expanding 
permanently 
in 
inflationary 
character, 
and 
in 
other 
moments, 
in 
exponential 
inflation, 
increasing 
both 
volume 
and 
mass. 
In 
that 
case, 
a 
higher 
temperature 
doesn’t 
mean 
higher 
energy. 
The 
Standard 
Model 
consideration 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
at 
1032K, 
as 
a 
state 
of 
cosmic 
higher 
energy 
is 
erroneous. 
There 
is 
more 
energy 
in 
the 
present 
Universe, 
even 
at 
2.7K 
(100.43K), 
according 
to 
the 
increasing 
mass. 
We 
can 
see 
a 
similar 
relation 
in 
black 
holes. 
High 
temperature 
means 
less 
mass, 
energy, 
and 
entropy; 
and 
lower 
temperature 
means 
more 
mass, 
energy, 
and 
entropy. 
The 
Universe 
and 
black 
holes 
have 
an 
intimate 
relation, 
and 
their 
corresponding 
formulas 
indicate 
that 
the 
Universe 
has 
double 
the 
mass 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
of 
the 
same 
size. 
Remember 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
Big 
Bang 
is 
like 
two 
black 
holes 
attached 
to 
each 
other: 
one 
in 
our 
Universe 
and 
the 
other 
in 
the 
parallel 
universe, 
realizing 
a 
interchanging 
process, 
duplicating 
mass. 


In 
effect, 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang 
can 
be 
calculated 
with 
the 
formula 
Rc2/G=M; 
and 
black 
holes 
have 
the 
formula 
Rc2/2G=M. 
The 
reason 
why 
black 
holes 
are 
considered 
heavy 
objects, 
with 
a 
big 
energy 
density, 
is 
because 
we 
compare 
them 
to 
the 
actual 
Universe, 
which 
is 
predominantly 
“vacuum” 
space. 
But 
if 
they 
are 
compared 
to 
the 
early 
Universe, 
exactly 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang 
or 
close 
to 
it, 
we 
could 
observe 
that 
the 
mass 
and 
energy 
of 
the 
Universe 
was 
double 
the 
mass 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
of 
the 
same 
size. 


As 
we 
explained 
before, 
black 
holes 
don’t 
act 
as 
deposits 
of 
mass; 
they 
act 
by 
interchanging 
matter-antimatter 
between 
Universes, 
and 
increasing 
the 
entropy 
inside 
them. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
formation 
of 
black 
holes 
is 
always 
maintaining 
a 
huge 
quantity 
of 
entropy 
inside 
them. 
This 
entropy, 
adding 
itself 
to 
the 
entropy 
of 
the 
normal 
Universe, 
will 
be 
reduced 
to 
a 
cozero 
value, 
exactly 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 



Bang, 
and 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Crunch, 
where 
in 
both, 
the 
entropy 
will 
be 
utilized 
to 
form 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
(spatially 
odd-numbered 
in 
the 
Big 
Bangs 
and 
even-numbered 
in 
the 
Big 
Crunches). 
For 
particles, 
the 
field 
of 
maximum 
energy 
is 
obtained 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
but 
this 
is 
to 
form 
particles. 
The 
formula 
is: 
ℏ/cλ=m 
or 
(ℏc)/λ=E, 
the 
relation 
in 
this 
case 
of 
E, 
or 
mass, 
is 
inversely 
related 
to 
space. 
In 
cosmic 
space, 
the 
relation 
is 
direct. 
As 
we 
explained 
before, 
in 
the 
graphs 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field, 
Planck 
length 
must 
be 
almost 
at 
the 
origin 
and 
not 
farther 
to 
the 
right. 
In 
consequence, 
from 
Planck 
length 
to 
0.687289278 
cm 
(the 
maximum 
wavelength 
corresponding 
to 
the 
neutrino 
field), 
practically 
all 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
particles 
can 
be 
formed, 
but 
only 
at 
determined 
points, 
according 
to 
the 
jumping 
systems 
of 
nature. 
And 
so, 
there 
would 
exist 
the 
3 
families 
of 
Standard 
Model 
(lighter 
scale) 
and 
the 
3 
families 
of 
GUT 
theory 
(heavier 
scale), 
6 
families 
in 
total.

Hubble 
"constant" 
The 
Hubble 
constant 
is 
a 
variable 
and 
changes 
continuously 
with 
time, 
decreasing 
in 
value. 
An 
approximate 
formula 
indicates 
us: 
Λc2=3H2 
or 
±√((Λc2)/3)=H 


Since 
H 
is 
variable, 
Λ 
needs 
to 
be 
variable. 


Besides 
that, 
Einstein’s 
equation 
indicates 
how 
matter 
affects 
the 
geometry 
of 
space 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Action 
and 
reaction 
is 
also 
a 
fundamental 
physical 
principle. 
Any 
entity 
that 
affects 
another 
entity 
must 
be 
itself 
affected 
by 
these 
interactions. 
If 
Λ 
is 
constant, 
nothing 
influences 
it, 
and 
this 
is 
against 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
action 
and 
reaction. 
In 
former 
sections, 
we 
spoke 
about 
the 
variability 
of 
Λ. 
Our 
position 
is 
clear: 
The 
cosmological 
“constant” 
(Λ) 
is 
a 
variable, 
decreasing 
with 
time, 
and 
has 
a 
nonzero 
value 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe. 


The 
formula 
to 
obtain 
the 
value 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
is 
very 
simple: 
Λ=6/R2 
in 
cm-2 
or 
(6/R2)c2 
in 
s-2 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
the 
Hubble 
parameter, 
also 
variable; 
and 
whose 
value 
also 
changes 
continuously 
in 
each 
new 
experiment 
(due 
to 
human 
discrepancies). 
To 
obtain 
it 
(although 
very 
approximately) 
by 
theoretical 
calculations, 
we 
use 
Λ. 


Λ≅ 
3x10-56 
cm-2 


H≅√(Λc2/3) 
≅ 
±2.99792458x10-18 
s-1 
The 
(+) 
sign 
pertains 
to 
our 
Universe 
The 
(-) 
sign 
pertains 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe. 
If 
the 
Universe 
expanded 
at 
its 
present 
rate 
from 
the 
beginning, 
its 
age 
would 
be 
time= 
1/H. 
But 
the 
Universe 
is 
expanding 
in 
an 
accelerated 
way, 
from 
the 
beginning 
to 
the 
end, 
and 
so, 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
larger. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
average 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
always 
FTL 
and 
according 
to 
the 
kinetic 
energy: 
(1/2)mv2=mc2, 
where 
v2=2c2 
and 
v=±√2c 
(the 
positive 
term 
is 
for 
our 
Universe). 
And 
so, 
the 
increasing 
factor 
is 
√2=1.4142… 
we 
can 
calculate 
approximately 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Universe 
using 
time 
≅ 
(1/H)(√2) 
≅ 
4.7173x1017 
s 
≅1.49483x1010 
years 



217. 
Static 
limit. 
Schwarzschild 
radius 
or 
event 
horizon 
The 
static 
limit 
is 
the 
limiting 
distance 
in 
which 
an 
inevitable 
dragging 
takes 
place. 
The 
Ergosphere 
is 
where 
Roger 
Penrose 
showed 
how 
energy 
could 
be 
extracted. 
The 
inner 
boundary 
is 
the 
event-horizon, 
Schwarzschild 
radius, 
or 
gravitational 
radius. 
Inside 
that, 
we 
irremediably 
go 
to 
the 
center. 
We 
need 
to 
point 
out 
some 
new 
concepts. 


1. 
The 
center 
is 
not 
a 
singularity. 
It 
is 
a 
hole, 
with 
no 
drawn 
circumference, 
unbounded, 
with 
radius 
λp, 
but 
with 
no 
material 
limit. 
If 
a 
material 
frontier 
would 
exist, 
we 
could 
divide 
it 
into 
smaller 
fractions 
than 
Planck 
length, 
and 
this 
is 
impossible. 
With 
no 
singularity, 
the 
end 
of 
time 
doesn't 
exist. 
It 
is 
just 
the 
beginning 
of 
time 
in 
the 
new 
(parallel) 
Universe. 
Another 
black 
hole 
exists 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
doing 
the 
same 
thing, 
but 
in 
an 
inverse 
process. 
2. 
A 
naked 
cosingularity, 
within 
a 
bigger 
Universe, 
doesn't 
exist. 
The 
only 
moment 
where 
a 
naked 
cosingularity 
existed 
was 
during 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
because 
the 
size 
of 
the 
Universe 
was 
λp. 

3. 
The 
virtual 
Schwarzschild 
radii 
of 
the 
particles, 
is 
double 
their 
collision 
distance. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
obtain 
their 
mass. 
The 
gravitational 
radius 
of 
a 
virtual 
black 
hole 
of 
a 
proton: 
2.5x10-52 
cm 
And 
the 
virtual 
gravitational 
wave 
of 
a 
proton: 
1.25x10-52. 
The 
formulas 
can 
explain 
it: 
Gravitational 
radius: 
RC2=2GM. 
Gravitational 
waves: 
RC2=GM.

Supposed 
composition 
of 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
composed 
by 
t±2/3; 
b∓1/3; 
W±1, 
and 
Z0 
in 
weak 
force 
formation 
(k-12π); 
that 
means 
that 
the 
components 
have 
more 
individual 
mass, 
than 
compared 
with 
strong 
force 
interaction. 
There 
is 
another 
Higgs 
Boson, 
united 
by 
means 
of 
a 
“hypergravitational” 
force, 
exactly 
at 
Planck 
time 
and 
around 
it. 
It 
is 
formed 
by 
4 
quarks, 
but 
united 
by 
the 
gravitational 
force. 
Each 
quark 
would 
be 
a 
heavy 
version 
of 
t 
and 
b, 
where 
in 
Planck 
era 
(k-24π), 
they 
had 
the 
same 
mass: 
2.39x1018 
GeV 
each, 
forming 
a 
quadrupole. 
The 
4 
quarks 
(2 
matter 
and 
2 
antimatter) 
are 
differentiated 
only 
by 
their 
charge 
±2/3 
and 
∓1/3. 
Higgs 
strong 
force 
boson, 
at 
field 
k-22π, 
with 
λ=8.73x10-31 
cm, 
and 
2.22x1016 
GeV; 
equivalent 
to 
1016.35±0.35 
GeV, 
is 
composed 
by 
two 
doublets 
or 
four 


mesons, 
formed 
by 
heavy 
versions 
of 
d(hd) 
and 
u(hu). 
They 
are 


and 
have 
a 
sum 
of 
1.77x1016 
GeV, 
according 
to 
the 
normal 
formula 
and 
the 
common 
factor 
division 
(2.22x1016/√(8π)) 
x 
4. 
The 
field 
of 
k-23π 
is 
formed 
by 
mesons, 
constituted 
by 
two 
heavy 
versions 
of 


c(hc) 
and 
s(hs) 
and 
their 
corresponding 
antiparticles: 
and 
. 
They 
are: 
and 
The 
sum 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
these 
4 
heavy 
mesons, 
in 
the 
most 
excited 
states, 
is 
4.12x1017 
GeV 
and 
its 
entire 
field 
is 
5.16x1017 
GeV. 
When 
the 
mesons 
and 
hadrons 
are 
formed 
with 
a 
much 
heavier 
quark 
and 
one 
or 
two 
lighter 
ones, 
the 
difference 
between 
them, 
produces 
different 
“copies” 
of 
them, 
but 
with 
larger 
masses, 
according 
to 
their 
excited 
states. 
Three 
of 
those 
mesons 
have 
excited 
varieties, 
since 
one 
of 
those 
quarks 
is 
much 
heavier 
than 
the 
other. 
Normal 
states 
of 
the 
4 
quarks 
have 
a 
sum 
of 
masses 
lighter 
than 
4.12x1017 
GeV 
in 
their 
normal 
states. 
There 
is 
definitively 
enough 
room 
to 
accommodate 
them, 
including 
the 
heaviest 
versions 
of 
excited 
states, 
similar 
to 
k-11π. 



219. 
Symmetry 
breakdown 
gives 
mass 
to 
particles 
The 
symmetry 
breakdown 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
gauge 
bosons, 
and 
only 
particles 
of 
force: 
graviton, 
gluons, 
and 
the 
already 
experimented 
W+,W-, 
and 
Z0, 
acquire 
mass, 
exactly 
at 
their 
corresponding 
level. 
Only 
the 
photon 
never 
obtains 
mass 
It 
neither 
has 
a 
heavy 
partner. 
A 
single 
Higgs 
doublet 
would 
be 
the 
simplest 
way 
to 
achieve 
this 
energy 
of 
symmetry 
breaking; 
but 
nature 
uses 
a 
different 
pattern: 
all 
the 
three 
Higgs 
Bosons 
use 
two 
doublets 
in 
scalar 
vectors, 
using 
four 
quarks 
or 
four 
mesons 
united 
by 
its 
corresponding 
force: 
weak 
force 
(four 
quarks), 
strong 
force 
(four 
mesons), 
and 
gravitational 
force 
(four 
quarks). 


GUT 
predicts 
heavy 
quarks, 
and 
in 
this 
position, 
establishes 
the 
presence 
of 
three 
new 
almost 
identical 
“photocopies”, 
or 
families 
of 
particles, 
changing 
only 
their 
λs 
and 
in 
consequence, 
their 
mass, 
among 
them. 
The 
change 
of 
mass, 
including 
the 
mass 
hierarchy 
Mw/Mp 
=10-17 
cm, 
was 
explained 
before. 
These 
three 
new 
families 
of 
particles 
are 
the 
explanation 
to 
the 
new 
heavier 
particles, 
observed 
in 
cosmics 
rays 
and 
in 
other 
natural 
effects. 
The 
appearance 
of 
three 
other 
families 
doesn’t 
complicate 
the 
“strangeness” 
of 
even 
more 
families 
and 
the 
doubt 
about 
their 
need, 
considering 
one 
family 
is 
enough 
in 
our 
macroscopical 
world. 
But 
this 
relation 
k'/λ=m 
is 
a 
natural 
relation, 
and 
when 
our 
universe 
had 
a 
microscosmic 
size, 
the 
big 
masses 
and 
smaller 
lengths 
were 
necessary, 
and 
automatically 
constituted. 
λ 
is 
practically 
the 
distance 
of 
microcosmos 
light 
space, 
but 
it 
can 
also 
be 
considered 
as 
Compton 
wavelength, 
that 
represents 
the 
wavelength 
associated 
with 
a 
particle 
of 
mass 
m; 
and 
its 
relation 
in 
relativistic 
quantum 
mechanics 
is 
ℏ/mc=λ. 
This 
is 
also 
considered 
as 
the 
Heisenberg 
principle 
ℏ=mcλ, 
where 
λ 
is 
the 
length 
in 
which 
we 
see 
the 
particle's 
quantum 
mechanical 
properties 
at 
collision 
distance 
or 
scattering 
distance. 
Also 
we 
can 
point 
it 
out 
as 
a 
Higgs 
length, 
forming 
a 
Higgs 
field, 
which 
has 
the 
total 
energy 
of 
particles; 
or 
the 
compound 
of 
them 
and 
their 
respective 
links, 
in 
a 
doublet 
or 
two 
doublet 
scalar 
field, 
forming 
a 
Higgs 
ocean, 
composed 
by 
a 
lot 
of 
Higgs 
fields 
vacuum 
expectation 
value, 
or 
simply, 
many 
Higgs 
fields, 
in 
a 
particular 
time 
of 
our 
Universe; 
except 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
there 
was 



only 
one 
Higgs 
field. 



In 
our 
macroscopical 
world, 
the 
first 
family 
is 
the 
only 
one 
that 
is 
necessary; 
but 
the 
others 
were 
necessary 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
when 
λ 
were 
smaller, 
but 
masses 
were 
much 
heavier. 
But 
time 
was 
too 
short 
in 
that 
moment? 
Remember, 
the 
Universe 
works 
with 
logarithmical 
measures, 
and 
so, 
the 
minimum 
time 
and 
minimum 
space 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
maximum 
measures. 
Microcosmos 
time 
lasted 
a 
very 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
time, 
and 
space 
less 
than 
1 
cm 
and 
less 
than 
3.33x10-11s 
(according 
to 
the 
limit 
of 
speed 
of 
light). 
To 
the 
Universe, 
small 
space 
and 
time 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
macrocosmic 
space 
and 
time. 



220. 
Two 
scales 
of 
Higgs 
fields 
(graphs) 
Two 
scales: 



If 
in 
the 
Higgs 
equations 
m3/c2 
> 
A; 
where 
A 
is 
a 
constant, 
the 
mathematical 
relation 
is 
correct, 
even 
with 
maximum 
limits 
of 
m, 
but 
it 
would 
be 
incorrect 
at 
certain 
minimum 
value 
of 
m 
(mass). 
The 
minimum 
mass 
accepted 
to 
form 
particles 
is 
the 
Higgs 
field 
of 
neutrino 
1, 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
maximum 
length 
≤ 
0.687289278 
cm. 
If 
the 
relation 
is 
correct 
even 
with 
the 
minimum 
mass 
of 
neutrinos, 
it 
is 
mathematically 
logical 
that 
it 
would 
be 
correct 
with 
heavier 
masses. 
Maximum 
mass 
has 
a 
limit 
(cofinite 
mass), 
but 
it 
doesn’t 
derive 
from 
the 
formula. 
The 
limit 
of 
maximum 
mass 
is 
conditioned 
by 
its 
λ, 
this 
is, 
the 
minimum 
length 
of 
space, 
equivalent 
to 
planck 
length 
and 
in 



consequence, 
particles 
are 
producing 
jumping 
space 
in 
the 
microcosmos; 
from 
λp 
to 
λ 
less 
than 
1 
cm, 
exactly 
equal 
to 
0.687289278 
cm. 
Longer 
distances 
or 
lighter 
particles 
than 
neutrino 
1 
are 
invalidated. 
And 
so, 
we 
obtained 
the 
conclusion, 
using 
another 
way, 
that 
Higgs 
fields 
are 
produced 
from 
Planck 
mass, 
and 
the 
maximum 
mass 
of 
particles 
is 
λp/√(8π); 
and 
in 
consequence, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
GUT 
theory, 
that 
three 
families 
exist 
in 
the 
heavier 
scale 
is 
correct, 
and 
three 
new 
families 
of 
heavier 
partners 
of 
particles 
are 
necessary 
to 
consider. 
The 
three 
families 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
need 
to 
add 
three 
more 
families 
of 
the 
GUT 
theory, 
and 
the 
unproved 
supposition 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
that 
the 
Higgs 
field 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat, 
is 
again 
discarded. 



221. 
Quarks 
in 
k-11π 
and 
k-12π 
We 
spoke 
of 
the 
k-11π 
field, 
which 
is 
already 
known 
and 
experimented, 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
field 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
14.716 
GeV 
and 
the 
maximum 
energy 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
4 
mesons 
or 
baryons 
is 
11.74 
GeV. 
The 
fundamental 
particles 
of 
this 
field 
are: 
and 
forming 
mesons: 
and 
: 
even 
most 
hadrons 
(mesons 
and 
baryons) 
can 
be 
accepted 
in 
this 
field, 
except 
t 
and 
b. 
The 
strong 
force 
acts 
in 
k-11π, 
and 
so 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
form 
mesons 
united 
by 
this 
force. 
Is 
impossible 
for 
quarks 
to 
be 
in 
isolation, 
and 
so 
a 
single 
doublet 
of 
quarks 
is 
impossible 
to 
produce 
because 
it 
will 
produce 
quarks 
by 
themselves. 
Leptons 
are 
constituted 
by 
a 
single 
doublet, 
because 
leptons 
can 
live 
alone. 
The 
t 
and 
b 
quarks 
and 
their 
compounds 
are 
included 
in 
the 
Higgs 
field, 
k-12π, 
using 
π 
plus 
instead 
of 
π 
minus, 
according 
to 
the 
hook 
needed, 
that 
was 
explained 
in 
the 
case 
of 
two 
levels 
of 
k-12π 
(using 
π 
plus 
and 
π 
minus). 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
will 
appear 
at 
the 
k-12π 
level 
with 
π 
plus, 
but 
using 
the 
weak 
force. 
Quarks 
(and 
no 
mesons) 
are 
formed 
in 
2 
doublets, 
and 
so 



and 
would 
act 
in 
this 
level. 
If 
the 
strong 
force 
acted 
here, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
form 
the 
and 
mesons, 
and 
there 
would 
be 
insufficient 
room, 
or 
the 
t 
quark 
would 
have 
to 
be 
much 
lighter. 
The 
influence 
of 
the 
weak 
force, 
instead 
of 
the 
strong 
force, 
gives 
the 
top 
quark 
the 
heavy 
mass, 
apparently 
distorted 
for 
one 
simple 
quark, 
in 
the 
first 
scale. 
The 
quartet 
of 
mesons 
could 
be: 




Moreover, 
the 
strong 
force 
acts 
in 
k-11π, 
and 
it 
has 
enough 
room 
to 
accommodate 
all 
the 
mesons 
and 
baryons 
heavier 
than 
the 
pions, 
in 
which 
mesons 
with 
t 
and 
b 
are 
not 
incorporated 
in 
its 
formation. 
For 
example, 
the 
lighter 
quartet 
(2 
doublets) 
of 
mesons, 
b, 
would 
be: 
using 
or 
(b-or 


b+), 
whose 
mass 
are: 
5.723 
GeV 
each, 
and 
(T)=9.46 
(u). 


Its 
mass: 
5.273 
+ 
5.273 
+ 
9.46 
+ 
uū; 
even 
uū 
(or 
in 
another 
similar 
field 
) 
is 
relatively 
negligible, 
only 
the 
other 
three 
mesons 
would 
have 
a 
total 
of 
20 
GeV, 
which 
is 
impossible 
to 
fit 
in 
k-11π 
because 
there 
is 
not 
enough 
room; 
and 
they 
need 
to 
be 
in 
k-12π. 



These 
masses 
are 
much 
heavier 
than 
the 
total 
energy 
of 
the 
field, 
k-11π. 
The 
heavy 
mass 
of 
t, 
around 
174 
GeV 
also 
needs 
to 
be 
in 
k-12π, 
because 
it's 
too 
heavy. 
The 
k-11π 
field 
doesn’t 
admit 
compounds 
with 
b 
or 
t 
quarks. 
But, 


the 
compounds 
formed 
by 
c 
and 
, 
or 
one 
of 
those 
quarks 
with 
u 
and 
d 
are 
accepted. 
Even 
with 
their 
heaviest 
masses, 
including 
resonances 
and 
excited 
states. 
Examples: 



Adding 
the 
masses 
of 
mesons: 
1.02 
GeV 
+ 
2.45 
GeV 
+2.45 
GeV 
+ 
4.26 
GeV= 
10.18 
GeV, 
but 
the 
energy 
at 
disposal 
to 
form 
particles 
is 
11.74; 
there 
is 
still 
more 
room 
to 
accommodate 
new 
heavier 
states. 


Definitively 
new 
versions 
of 
heavier 
excited 
states 
of 
and 
will 
appear 
in 
the 
future. 



222. 
Standard 
Model 
and 
GUT's 
scales 
of 
particles; 
hook 
union 
The 
Standard 
Model 
is 
a 
scale 
of 
lighter 
particles, 
and 
the 
GUT’s 
scale, 
of 
heavier 
particles. 
Both 
use 
a 
different 
π 
and 
different 
numerical 
value. 



The 
numbers 
are 
different, 
but 
k-12π 
has 
two 
different 
values. 
But 
even 
if 
all 
the 
lighter 
scale 
used 
π 
minus, 
a 
hook 
in 
k-12π 
exists, 
where 
this 
is 
interchanged. 
All 
known 
particles 
use 
π 
minus; 
except 
in 
k-12π, 
where 
t, 
b, 
W+, 
W-, 
Z0, 
and 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
use 
π 
plus. 
In 
that 
way, 
even 
with 



this 
partial 
example, 
the 
utilization 
of 
both 
scales 
has 
been, 
at 
least, 
partially 
proved. 
It 
would 
be 
an 
ugly 
asymmetry 
to 
use 
a 
scale 
for 
11 
levels 
of 
energy 
and 
the 
other 
scale 
for 
only 
one. 
The 
logical 
explanation 
(and 
it 
is 
reinforced 
by 
the 
common 
system 
in 
our 
Universe 
to 
use 
a 
“hook 
relation” 
between 
scales); 
is 
that 
both 
scales 
have 
12 
levels, 
interchanging 
one.(In 
this 
section, 
we 
use 
three 
different 
representations 
of 
this 
interchange). 
k-12π 
has 
2 
different 
energetic 
values. 


331.5 
GeV 
and 
482.4 
GeV. 
We 
suppose 
that 
the 
first 
one 
has 
a 
doublet 
(leptons)andthesecondhasaquartet(twodoublets)ofquarks.
The 
sum 
of 
the 
masses 
of 
t 
and 
b 
is 
174+4.8 
approximately 
178.8 
GeV. 
And 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
4 
quarks 
is 
357.6. 
The 
difference 
with 
the 
theoretical 
value 
is 
used 
to 
have 
an 
additional 
room 
for 
excited 
states. 
But 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
is 
formed 
by 
quarks, 
using 
the 
forces 
W± 
and 
Z0, 
and 
not 
by 
mesons. 


The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
included 
in 
this 
field 
of 
482.4 
GeV, 
needs 
to 
be, 
not 
only 
less 
than 
1000 
GeV, 
but 
also 
no 
more 
than 
482.4 
GeV, 
which 
is 
the 
maximum 
mass 
of 
the 
field. 
We 
suppose 
a 
range 
between: 



384.88GeV 
≤ 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
≤ 
482.4 
GeV 
The 
other 
(K-12π) 
with 
331.50 
is 
the 
supposed 
fourth 
field 
of 
the 
family 
of 
the 
neutrino, 
(or 
better), 
the 
first 
neutrino 
of 
the 
second 
scale, 
that 
we 
named 
neutronio, 
whose 
mass 
is 
around 
132 
GeV. 


This 
would 
be 
the 
lightest 
heavy 
partner. 


Another 
representation 
of 
these 
two 
scales 
would 
be 
Between 
scales 
in 
k-12 
482.4/331.55 
≅ 
1.45499 
approx. 
Its 
exact 
value 
is 
√(e0.75)=√2.117000017=1.454991415 
or 
anti 
ln(0.75/2) 
This 
mathematical 
relation 
of 
the 
two 
scales 
gives 
the 
factor 
between 
them 
and 
so: 


331.55x√2.117000017=482.4GeV 



The 
experiments 
of 
the 
LHC 
need 
to 
look 
around 
these 
2 
points 
in 
both 
scales: 
k-12πminus 
and 
k-12πplus, 
where 
they 
could 
discover 
two 
particles: 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
around 
482.4 
GeV 
(maximum 
value, 
and 
no 
less 
than 
384.88 
GeV) 
and 
a 
new 
type 
of 
a 
heavier 
neutral 
particle, 
the 
neutronio, 
around 
132 
GeV. 
Using 
these 
values 
to 
look 
for 
these 
particles 
is, 
at 
least 
better, 
than 
blindly 
looking 
for 
them. 



223. 
Opera 
neutrino 
anomaly 
at 
CERN 
The 
Opera 
neutrino 
anomaly 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
violation 
to 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity, 
since 
it 
measured 
the 
speed 
of 
those 
neutrinos 
as 
faster 
than 
the 
maximum 
limit 
of 
velocity, 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
a 
vacuum. 
The 
Opera 
Experiment 
(at 
CERN) 
had 
found 
the 
result 
3 
years 
back, 
but 
it 
had 
never 
published 
it 
before. 
The 
Opera 
team 
checked 
and 
re-checked 
everything, 
correcting 
any 
error, 
and 
found 
that 
the 
result 
survived. 
In 
that 
way, 
faster 
than 
light 
particles 
(mu-neutrinos) 
were 
presented 
as 
a 
real 
thing. 
However, 
some 
months 
later 
(on 
February 
2012), 
in 
an 
official 
announcement 
of 
the 
Opera 
Experiment, 
it 
was 
informed 
that 
two 
errors 
that 
could 
significantly 
affect 
the 
reported 
result 
were 
identified. 
Both 
effects 
can 
modify 
the 
neutrinos 
flight 
time 
in 
opposite 
directions. 
So, 
the 
experimental 
result 
in 
Opera, 
about 
FTL 
neutrinos, 
is 
in 
doubt. 
Other 
complementary 
experiments 
are 
necessary. 
The 
problem 
in 
Physics, 
especially 
in 
recent 
years, 
is 
to 
find 
the 
experimental 
results 
before 
the 
theory 
is 
completed. 
If 
it 
is 
supposed 
that 
FTL 
neutrinos 
exist, 
we 
need 
to 
find 
the 
theoretical 
concepts, 
in 
order 
to 
accept 
or 
discard 
them. 
Independently 
of 
the 
final 
result 
on 
the 
Opera 
collaboration, 
by 
continuing 
its 
campaign 
of 
verifications 
on 
the 
neutrino 
velocity 
measurement, 
we 
will 
try 
to 
find 
the 
theoretical 
possibility 
about 
the 
existence 
of 
FTL 
neutrinos. 
Even 
considering 
that 
particle 
physicists 
detected 
neutrinos 
traveling 
faster 
than 
light, 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
way 
to 
send 
information 
back 
in 
time, 
erasing 
the 
line 
between 
past 
and 
present, 
and 
breaking 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
is 
forbidden, 
like 
we 
will 
explain 
further. 
In 
the 
first 
Opera 
experiment, 
the 
particles 
arrived 
at 
Gran 
Sasso, 
sixty 
billionths 
of 
a 
second 
earlier, 
with 
a 
error 
margin 
of 
plus 
or 
minus 
10 
billionths 
of 
a 
second 
(732 
km 
were 
completed 
in 
2.441629177 
milliseconds; 
since 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
is 
2.99792458x1010 
cm/s; 
the 
neutrinos 
were 
traveling 
at 
approximately 
2.99799825x1010 
cm/s 
(approx.>7.37 
km/s 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum). 
These 
results 
are 
in 
doubt 
right 
now. 
If 
this 
is 
proven 
to 
be 
true, 
we 
need 
to 
apply 
the 
known 
principles, 
or 
to 
find 
other 
unknown 
principles, 
to 
complete 
the 
actual 
theory. 



FTL 
neutrinos 
were 
obtained 
before, 
in 
the 
Minos 
experiment, 
near 
Chicago 
in 
the 
U.S., 
where 
hints 
were 
seen 
of 
neutrinos 
moving 
FTL 
in 
2007. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity 
is 
beautiful 
and 
always 
proven; 
and 
these 
results 
don’t 
discard 
it; 
even 
more, 
they 
confirm 
it, 
as 
we 
will 
explain 
further 
on. 



224. 
Experimental 
neutrinos 
in 
supernova 
1987A 
According 
to 
the 
experiment 
on 
supernova 
1987A, 
it 
was 
suggested 
that 
if 
neutrinos 
travelled 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
they 
would 
have 
arrived 
and 
been 
detected 
much 
earlier 
than 
they 
were, 
following 
this 
cosmic 
explosion 
(in 
the 
Large 
Magellanic 
Cloud 
galaxy). 
The 
Kamioka 
Nucleon 
Decay 
Experiment 
detector 
in 
Japan 
picked 
up 
neutrinos 
from 
the 
explosion 
3 
hours 
before 
light 
reached 
earth. 
But 
this 
does 
not 
necessarily 
mean 
the 
neutrinos 
traveled 
FTL. 
It 
just 
means 
that 
the 
neutrinos 
left 
the 
supernova 
first, 
while 
the 
light, 
perhaps 
was 
trapped 
for 
a 
while, 
said 
Bell. 
If 
the 
neutrinos 
had 
been 
traveling 
FTL, 
like 
the 
CERN 
suggests, 
they 
would 
have 
reached 
Earth 
years, 
rather 
than 
hours 
earlier. 
But 
this 
process 
was 
a 
natural 
explosion. 
In 
a 
process 
of 
a 
high-energy 
accelerator, 
the 
neutrinos 
can 
be 
accelerated 
with 
a 
big 
performance, 
even 
though 
reaching 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
is 
forbidden, 
or 
obtaining 
∞ 
mass 
is 
impossible 
in 
a 
classical 
or 
relativistic 
way, 
To 
matter, 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum 
is 
an 
unreachable 
limit. 
Even 
more, 
there 
are 
other 
mass 
limits, 
such 
as: 
the 
maximum 
mass 
for 
a 
particle 
of 
matter, 
and 
even 
more, 
the 
maximum 
mass 
for 
a 
lepton, 
for 
a 
neutrino, 
or 
inclusively 
the 
maximum 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe. 
In 
other 
words, 
the 
speed 
at 
maximum 
levels 
of 
the 
neutrino 
would 
be 
always 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
Even 
if 
theoretically 
permitted, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
useless 
task. 
In 
a 
practical 
sense, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
pass, 
or 
even 
to 
reach 
the 
maximum 
mass 
limits 
mentioned 
before, 
especially 
the 
maximum 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
or 
to 
try 
to 
reach 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
the 
vacuum, 
an 
impossibility 
for 
any 
particle 
of 
matter. 
Nature 
is 
wise 
and 
efficient. 
The 
neutrino, 
instead 
of 
performing 
a 
useless 
effort, 
uses 
quantum 
mechanics 
and 
realizes 
a 
convenient 
work. 
But 
what 
about 
quantum 
mechanics 
rules? 
Remember 
the 
process 
used 
by 
older 
calculators, 
that 
we 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections 
of 
this 
book 
that 
they 
tried 
to 
reach 
infinity 
in 
an 
operation 
when 
dividing 
by 
zero. 
The 
new 
calculators 
simply 
give 
the 
answer 
"e" 
(error), 
trying 
to 
avoid 
the 
task. 
The 
neutrino 
avoids 
trying 
to 
reach 
the 
unattainable 
limit 
and 
use 
quantum 
mechanics, 
in 
a 
permitted 
and 
easier 
way 
that 
we 
will 



explain 
in 
next 
sections. 



225. 
Four 
solutions 
of 
the 
mass 
and 
speed 
formula 
Before 
talking 
about 
quantum 
mechanics, 
we 
will 
talk 
about 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
relativity. 


The 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity 
considers 
a 
mathematical 
relation 
between 
mass 
and 
speed, 
according 
to 
the 
formula: 


m1=m0/√(1-v2/c2) 
This 
has 
4 
solutions: 


a) 
The 
speed 
of 
particles 
of 
matter, 
or 
aggregated 
matter, 
known 
as 
tardyons, 
will 
always 
be 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
In 
that 
case, 
mass 
increases 
with 
speed, 
in 
a 
permissible 
way 
and 
with 
a 
positive 
result. 
Its 
effect 
is 
measurable 
in 
particles 
traveling 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
At 
the 
beginning, 
of 
imparting 
energy 
to 
particles, 
the 
speed 
increases 
more 
than 
the 
mass; 
closer 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
the 
effect 
on 
mass 
is 
much 
bigger. 
b) 
No 
particle 
of 
matter, 
or 
aggregated 
matter, 
can 
reach 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
reserved 
to 
particles 
of 
force 
(luxons): 
photons 
and 
gravitons, 
whose 
mass 
at 
rest 
is 
zero. 
To 
any 
other 
particle 
(with 
non 
zero 
mass 
at 
rest), 
where 
the 
former 
formula 
is 
applied, 
its 
mass 
would 
be 
∞ 
at 
speed 
of 
light, 
and 
this 
is 
impossible. 
c) 
Particles 
of 
matter, 
or 
aggregated 
matter, 
with 
a 
speed 
FTL 
(faster 
than 
light), 
will 
obtain 
an 
imaginary 
mass. 
These 
theoretical 
particles 
are 
known 
as 
tachyons, 
nonexistent 
in 
our 
physical 
world 
of 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
one 
time. 
The 
tachyons 
can 
exist 
in 
Universes 
with 
larger 
number 
of 
dimensions, 
where 
the 
speed 
of 
their 
light 
is 
faster 
than 
our 
light. 
In 
those 
worlds, 
they 
would 
travel 
slower 
than 
speed 
of 
their 
corresponding 
light; 
but 
according 
to 
our 
measure, 
they 
would 
travel 
FTL. 

a) 
The 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
relation. 
Using 
this 
relativistic 
formula, 
with 
the 
laws 
of 
quantum 
mechanics, 
and 
especially 
for 
leptons, 
and 
even 
better, 
neutrinos, 
in 
an 
FTL 
condition. 
In 
that 
way, 
we 
need 
to 
write 
the 
square 
of 
the 
formula. 

226. 
Restriction 
of 
light 
speed 
limit 
on 
matter, 
not 
space 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity 
determines 
that 
all 
the 
objects 
in 
our 
Universe 
obey 
the 
light 
speed 
limit, 
but 
there 
isn't 
any 
restriction 
on 
the 
speed 
of 
expansion 
(or 
contraction) 
of 
space 
itself. 
Our 
4th 
dimensional 
Universe 
(3 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
1 
time) 
is 
at 
least, 
in 
the 
microcosmos 
inflation 
era 
and 
in 
the 
present 
time, 
always 
accelerating. 
In 
that 
way, 
our 
cosmic 
space 
is 
expanding 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
(FTL). 
Besides 
that, 
considering 
space-warps: 
shortcuts 
in 
curved 
space-time, 
we 
need 
to 
increase 
at 
least 
one 
spatial 
dimension. 
Increasing 
dimensions, 
the 
corresponding 
speed 
of 
light 
is 
faster. 
But 
these 
wormholes 
are 
impossible 
to 
access 
since 
their 
size 
is 
always 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length. 
Einstein’s 
General 
theory 
of 
Relativity 
enforces 
Einstein's 
limit. 
Time 
contracts 
when 
speed 
is 
increased 
or 
gravity 
(mass 
is 
increased); 
two 
opposite 
effects. 
While 
reaching 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum 
or 
reaching 
the 
cofinite 
mass 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang 
or 
in 
the 
center 
of 
a 
black 
hole, 
time 
totally 
vanishes. 
In 
both 
cases, 
a 
wormhole 
is 
opened 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter, 
with 
size 
of 
2λp 
(λp 
in 
each 
Universe). 
This 
concept 
was 
explained 
in 
former 
sections. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
cofinite 
mass, 
gravity, 
or 
mass 
density, 
the 
value 
is 
approx. 
1.23x1093 
g/cm3. 
In 
next 
section 
we 
will 
apply 
this 
concept 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 



227. 
Neutrinos 
in 
FTL 
motion; 
particle-
antiparticle 
pairs 
For 
the 
consideration 
of 
letter 
d) 
of 
section 
225, 
we 
need 
to 
write 
the 
formula 
in 
squared 
form. 
And 
so: 


m12=(m02)/(1-v2/c2) 


If 
v>c 
the 
formula 
would 
give 
a 
negative 
term 
-m12. 
-m12 
has 
two 
imaginary 
roots: 
+m1i 
and 
–m1i; 
but 
it 
also 
has 
2 
real 
values, 
with 
opposite 
sign: 


-m12=(m1)(-m1) 


We 
would 
have 
the 
relation 
between 
+m 
(mass 
in 
our 
Universe) 
and 
–m 
(the 
mass 
in 
the 
Universe 
of 
antimatter). 
We 
obtained 
this 
relation 
before, 
when 
we 
obtained 
Planck 
mass. 
In 
effect, 
mp2=(ℏc)/G 
and 
mp=±roots, 
showing 
that 
our 
Universe 
and 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter 
have 
existed 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
Both 
Universes 
have 
a 
connection 
in 
CPT 
symmetry 
and 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
quantum 
mechanics, 
including 
Bell's 
theorem 
(or 
quantum 
connection), 
a 
neutrino 
can 
reach 
an 
FTL 
motion, 
but 
close 
to 
the 
barrier, 
without 
canceling 
the 
Special 
Theory 
of 
Relativity, 
but 
applying 
it 
in 
a 
more 
sophisticated 
way, 
mixing 
quantum 
mechanics 
with 
it. 
This 
process 
is 
in 
accordance 
with 
Einstein's 
formula 
and 
would 
be 
detailed 
in 
the 
next 
section. 



228. 
Impossibility 
to 
propel 
large 
objects 
at 
FTL 
speeds 
The 
possibility 
to 
propel 
large 
objects 
past 
the 
light 
barrier 
is 
null, 
as 
we 
explained 
before 
in 
this 
book. 
The 
paradox 
of 
measure 
is 
Planck 
mass 
(2.17x10-5 
g) 
and 
so, 
any 
object 
with 
mass 
above 
this 
limit 
cannot 
use 
quantum 
mechanics 
laws 
and 
so, 
FTL 
travel 
is 
totally 
forbidden 
for 
them. 
Pushing 
microscopical 
objects 
(particles) 
past 
the 
light 
barrier 
(or 
Einstein 
barrier), 
is 
a 
real 
possibility 
according 
to 
quantum 
mechanics, 
but 
even 
so, 
it 
would 
be 
impossible 
for 
FTL 
travel 
or 
FTL 
signaling. 
However, 
it 
is 
forbidden 
for 
any 
particle 
of 
matter 
to 
exactly 
reach 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum, 
because 
only 
particles 
of 
force, 
massless 
at 
rest, 
“luxons” 
(photons 
in 
any 
time 
and 
gravitons 
after 
the 
first 
chronos), 
can 
travel 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
Any 
particle 
of 
matter, 
with 
mass 
at 
rest, 
increasing 
in 
speed 
in 
a 
moving 
frame, 
obtains 
∞ 
mass 
at 
the 
light 
barrier, 
and 
this 
result 
is 
impossible. 
Quantum 
mechanics 
accept 
the 
possibility 
of 
passing 
the 
light 
barrier, 
while 
avoiding 
it, 
never 
reaching 
it. 
In 
other 
words, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
put 
a 
particle 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
Einstein 
barrier, 
without 
passing 
through 
the 
region 
of 
infinite 
mass, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
tunneling 
effect. 



229. 
Quantum 
processes 
In 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
our 
concept 
of 
reality 
is 
vanished. 
For 
example: 
a 
particle 
can 
vanish 
without 
a 
trace 
(quantum 
annihilation); 
or 
appear 
out 
of 
nowhere 
(quantum 
creation); 
move 
from 
one 
location 
to 
another 
without 
passing 
through 
the 
intermediate 
space 
(quantum 
tunneling), 
or 
quickly 
turning 
over 
from 
one 
state 
of 
being 
to 
another 
(quantum 
jumping). 
So 
far, 
no 
one 
in 
science 
has 
attempted 
to 
use 
quantum 
mechanics 
for 
FTL 
communication. 
To 
use 
Quantum 
mechanics 
for 
a 
superluminal 
communication 
focus 
is 
called 
“quantum 
connection” 
(Bell's 
theorem). 
Briefly 
interacted, 
particle-
antiparticle 
pairs 
remain 
always 
connected 
by 
an 
almost 
instantaneous 
link 
and 
their 
effect 
doesn’t 
change 
even 
with 
interposed 
shielding 
or 
large 
distances. 
We 
will 
try 
to 
explain 
this 
“phenomenal” 
effect 
later. 
Quantum 
waves 
do 
not 
dwell 
in 
normal 
space 
(3rd 
space), 
but 
in 
a 
larger 
multidimensional 
space, 
called 
configuration 
space 
(3rd 
dimension 
by 
each 
particle=6), 
better 
written 
as 
2x3rd, 
to 
avoid 
any 
confusion 
with 
multidimensional 
universes. 



230. 
Wrong 
position 
to 
apply 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
to 
macrocosmos 
The 
physicist, 
Daniel 
M. 
Greenberger, 
wrote: 
“Einstein 
said 
that 
if 
Quantum 
mechanics 
were 
correct, 
then 
the 
world 
would 
be 
crazy. 
Einstein 
was 
right, 
the 
world 
is 
crazy”. 
But 
even 
after 
quantum 
mechanics 
are 
completely 
proven 
and 
accepted 
by 
all 
the 
scientific 
community, 
our 
macroscopical 
world 
must 
be 
forever 
classical. 
A 
wrong 
position 
is 
to 
apply 
Quantum 
mechanics 
laws 
on 
it; 
just 
like 
applying 
classical 
concepts, 
without 
considering 
Quantum 
mechanics 
in 
the 
microcosmos. 
But 
we 
see 
an 
opposite 
position 
in 
practice. 
For 
example: 
Quantum 
mechanics 
are 
used 
in 
the 
development 
of 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
and 
multidimensional 
Universes, 
obtaining 
an 
erroneous 
conclusion 
of 
10500 
Universes 
or 
even 
much 
more, 
including 
an 
absurdity: 
∞ 
Universes. 
And 
classical 
concepts 
are 
applied, 
forgetting 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
to 
explain 
FTL 
neutrinos. 
(?!). 



231. 
Quantum 
Mechanics, 
time. 
Tachyons 
In 
contrast 
to 
classical 
physics, 
where 
time 
runs 
in 
one 
way 
only 
(temporal 
direction 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang), 
quantum 
mechanics 
permits 
two 
directions. 
For 
that 
reason, 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
coexist, 
and 
so, 
there 
exists 
a 
time 
symmetry, 
and 
both 
directions 
are 
possible: 
past 
and 
future 
time 
directions. 
Theoretically, 
particles 
that 
travel 
faster 
than 
light 
are: 
tachyons 
and 
particles 
that 
travel 
backwards 
in 
time 
(antiparticles). 
Tachyons 
are 
still 
in 
doubt, 
but 
antiparticles 
are 
not. 
They 
have 
negative 
energy 
or 
negative 
mass. 
Tachyons 
have 
imaginary 
mass 
or 
imaginary 
energy 
mass. 
In 
leptons, 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs, 
a 
doublet 
of 
particles 
is 
formed 
after 
they 
separate 
(in 
opposite 
ways), 
permanently 
maintaining 
an 
instantaneous 
FTL 
connection. 
In 
every 
particle 
acts 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
where 
its 
position, 
speed, 
and 
spin, 
has 
an 
uncertainty. 
But 
if 
in 
any 
particle, 
a 
measure 
is 
obtained, 
the 
other 
particle 
immediately 
acquires, 
in 
an 
FTL 
connection, 
the 
same 
result. 
Classically, 
when 
a 
formidable 
obstacle 
exists, 
including 
a 
barrier 
limit, 
any 
object 
is 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
it. 
But 
for 
a 
particle, 
this 
is 
different. 
In 
the 
microcosmos 
there 
is 
a 
possibility 
that 
it 
can 
penetrate 
the 
wall 
and 
emerge 
on 
the 
other 
side. 
But 
also, 
in 
an 
apparent 
FTL 
motion, 
with 
a 
better 
concept, 
emerge 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
without 
having 
to 
penetrate 
the 
wall. 
Within 
Quantum 
mechanics 
(and 
more 
accurately, 
in 
this 
tunneling 
process), 
this 
doesn’t 
depend 
on 
the 
barrier 
width. 
This 
consists 
on 
superluminal 
and 
on 
any 
kind 
of 
large 
(group) 
velocities, 
v. 
In 
other 
words, 
it 
becomes 
an 
evanescent 
wave 
(with 
FTL 
motion). 
But 
this 
FTL 
motion 
is 
only 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
light 
barrier, 
with 
a 
minimal 
difference, 
but 
always 
being 
an 
FTL 
motion. 
For 
example: 
0.99999 
and 
1.00001, 
their 
product 
is 
12 
or 
1. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
general 
formula 
would 
be: 


Retarded 
wave 
x 
advanced 
wave 
=c2 
where 
the 
roots 
are 
±c; 
and 
retarded 
wave 
+ 
advanced 
wave 
≅ 
2c 
where 
the 
average 
is 
2c/2=c. 
The 
speed 
in 
the 
retarded 
wave 
is 
slower 
than 
c, 
but 
almost 
c; 
the 
speed 
in 
the 
advanced 
wave 
is 
faster 
than 
c, 
but 
almost 
c. 



The 
explanation 
about 
this 
apparent 
anomalous 
performance 
is 
based 
in 
the 
principle 
of 
efficiency 
of 
nature. 
The 
neutrino 
is 
accelerated 
continuously 
and 
its 
speed 
is 
increased 
trying 
to 
reach 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
but 
this 
is 
impossible. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
its 
mass 
increases 
permanently, 
but 
this 
cannot 
continue 
eternally. 
The 
solution: 
to 
pass 
to 
the 
other 
side, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
tunneling 
effect. 



232. 
Advanced 
and 
retarded 
waves 
The 
light 
barrier 
has 
two 
sides, 
and 
the 
“FTL 
motion” 
of 
mu-neutrino 
in 
Opera 
experiment, 
is 
only 
one 
side 
of 
the 
barrier, 
not 
exactly 
a 
faster 
than 
light 
measure. 
In 
effect, 
according 
to 
that 
experiment, 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
neutrino 
was 
1.000024574c, 
the 
advanced 
wave 
of 
the 
pair. 
This 
result 
was 
published 
because 
it 
was 
a 
crucial 
and 
very 
important 
anomaly, 
but 
it 
was 
incomplete. 
Normally 
both 
waves 
(advanced 
and 
retarded) 
are 
together; 
and 
it 
is 
incorrect 
to 
consider 
one 
alone. 
However, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
separate 
both 
waves 
in 
two 
situations: 
a) 
when 
a 
black 
hole 
is 
close 
to 
them 
(Big 
gravity) 
or 
when 
light 
particles, 
especially 
neutrinos, 
are 
arriving 
at 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
consider 
both 
cases, 
not 
only 
our 
Universe, 
but 
also 
in 
our 
antimatter 
Universe. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
neutrinos, 
there 
exits 
a 
moment 
where 
both 
waves 
are 
separated 
and 
it 
is 
feasible 
to 
detect 
both 
waves, 
retarded 
and 
advanced, 
in 
individual 
results 
in 
the 
neutrino 
detector. 
The 
equivalent 
retarded 
wave 
would 
be 
0.999975426c, 
in 
order 
to 
have 
a 
consistent 
result. 
For 
us, 
tachyons 
are 
inexistent 
in 
our 
world, 
because 
they 
always 
need 
to 
travel 
FTL 
and 
they 
don't 
have 
a 
retarded 
wave. 
A 
tachyon 
is 
alone 
and 
possesses 
an 
imaginary 
rest 
mass. 
A 
tachyon 
is 
always 
a 
tachyon. 
But 
antiparticles 
are 
different, 
they 
act 
in 
pairs: 
(particle-antiparticle) 
or 
(retardedadvanced 
waves). 
Like 
Dirac’s 
equation, 
Maxwell’s 
wave 
equation 
for 
light 
has 
also 
two 
solutions. 
In 
particles: 
“retarded 
solution” 
(normal 
direction, 
from 
the 
past 
to 
the 
future) 
that 
describes 
a 
wave 
traveling 
forward 
in 
time, 
and 
the 
“advanced 
solution” 
that 
describes 
a 
light 
wave, 
traveling 
backwards 
in 
time 
(from 
the 
future 
to 
the 
past, 
or 
traveling 
to 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter). 
A 
negative-mass 
particle 
traveling 
backwards 
in 
time 
can 
always 
be 
reinterpreted 
as 
a 
positive 
mass 
particle 
traveling 
forwards 
in 
time. 
The 
forward 
and 
backward 
waves 
are 
part 
of 
a 
single 
inseparable 
process. 
The 
two 
waves 
are 
always 
in 
pair, 
and 
cannot 
be 
separated 
in 
a 
normal 
process, 
but 
it 
is 
feasible 
to 
have 
a 
separation, 
considering 
the 
other 
Universe 
of 
antimatter. 



233. 
Both 
waves 
and 
their 
relation 
Both 
waves 
have 
an 
intimate 
relation. 
Their 
average 
is 
always 
c. 
This 
is 
the 
complete 
explanation 
of 
why 
we 
use 
c 
in 
the 
formula 
to 
obtain 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
particles 
of 
matter; 
different 
to 
the 
Standard 
Model 
expectation, 
that 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter. 
According 
to 
our 
position, 
the 
formula 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
principle, 
key 
of 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
is 
the 
correct 
way 
for 
the 
particles 
of 
matter 
to 
obtain 
mass, 
just 
like 
we 
explained 
before. 
The 
Higgs 
weak 
boson 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
W+, 
W-, 
and 
Z0. 
In 
our 
modified 
Higgs 
field, 
we 
use 
λ 
as 
the 
variable 
value 
to 
obtain 
different 
masses. 
This 
λ, 
known 
as 
collision 
distance, 
Higgs 
length, 
or 
Compton 
wavelength, 
is 
the 
key. 
We 
need 
to 
explain 
another 
concept 
in 
this 
moment. 
The 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
related 
in 
CPT 
symmetry 
uses 
a 
retarded 
(particle) 
and 
an 
advanced 
(antiparticle) 
wave, 
but 
their 
average 
is 
c. 
The 
speed 
of 
light 
is 
never 
applied 
to 
these 
particles 
(we 
use 
>c 
or 
<c, 
but 
never 
=c). 
λ 
(as 
abstract 
space), 
which 
determines 
the 
mass 
of 
particles, 
uses 
c, 
the 
average 
value. 



And 
so, 
m=ℏ/cλ 
or 
k'/λ 
In 
the 
Opera 
(neutrino) 
experiment, 
the 
relation 
between 
particle-antiparticle 
is 
the 
same, 
but 
we 
use 
a 
relation 
with 
the 
antimatter 
Universe. 


The 
Icarus 
experiment, 
also 
located 
at 
Gran 
Sasso, 
found 
that 
the 
neutrinos 
were 
traveling 
at 
an 
average 
speed 
of 
light. 
This 
doesn’t 
refute 
the 
Opera 
results, 
because 
that 
average 
indicates 
neutrinos 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
but 
also 
complementary 
neutrinos 
FTL. 
The 
other 
way 
to 
obtain 
this 
average, 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
would 
be 
that 
all 
neutrinos 
have 



a 
velocity 
exactly 
as 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
which 
is 
forbidden. 
No 
particle 
or 
antiparticle 
can 
have 
exactly 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
The 
average 
could 
be 
the 
speed 
of 
light; 
so 
in 
conclusion, 
some 
of 
them 
need 
to 
travel 
FTL. 



234. 
Quantum 
connections 
This 
integrated 
relation 
in 
the 
corresponding 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
is 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
quantum 
connection, 
Bell’s 
theorem, 
existing 
but 
still 
inexplicable: 
each 
particle 
has 
with 
its 
partner 
(another 
particle 
which 
had 
a 
special 
relation 
or 
contact 
with 
it) 
a 
permanent 
link 
with 
a 
real 
superluminal 
effect, 
with 
an 
almost 
simultaneous 
reaction 
between 
them, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
very 
far 
apart). 
A 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
is 
applied 
in 
this 
connection. 
The 
pair, 
if 
it 
is 
not 
destroyed 
by 
the 
particles 
making 
contact, 
is 
put 
apart 
in 
opposite 
ways. 
The 
quantum 
connection 
is 
a 
permanent 
link. 
Here's 
a 
virtual 
example: 
try 
moving 
yourself 
in 
front 
of 
a 
mirror. 
Your 
“partner” 
(your 
image) 
will 
do 
exactly 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
a 
CPT 
and 
instantaneous 
connection. 
But 
this 
is 
a 
virtual 
example. 
The 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
has 
a 
more 
real 
connection. 
However, 
the 
inverse 
process 
is 
mathematically 
correct 
too. 
In 
our 
world, 
the 
relation 
between 
a 
particle-antiparticle 
pair 
is 
only 
exact 
at 
the 
beginning, 
when 
the 
production 
of 
particles-antiparticles 
is 
100% 
(50%-50% 
each), 
but 
later, 
when 
the 
particles 
are 
separated, 
matter 
will 
be 
kept, 
but 
the 
antiparticle 
will 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
antimatter 
Universe. 
The 
Bell 
connection 
is 
maintained 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter. 
Remember, 
a 
negative-energy 
particle 
traveling 
backwards 
in 
time 
can 
always 
be 
reinterpreted 
as 
a 
positive-energy 
particle 
traveling 
forward 
in 
time. 



235. 
Particle-antiparticle 
pairs, 
advanced-
retarded 
waves 
The 
advanced 
waves 
can 
be 
considered 
as 
oscillations 
that 
travel 
backwards 
in 
time. 
Ordinary 
light 
waves 
are 
called 
“retarded” 
waves. 
But 
both 
kinds 
of 
waves 
coincide 
at 
all 
times 
and 
the 
resultant 
is 
always 
a 
retarded 
way 
traveling 
from 
past 
to 
future, 
or 
a 
light 
wave. 
There's 
a 
similar 
process 
with 
a 
particle-antiparticle 
pair. 
Even 
existing 
advanced 
waves 
never 
occur 
alone. 
They 
are 
always 
paired 
with 
retarded 
waves. 
For 
the 
same 
reason, 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
single 
particle 
or 
antiparticle 
(one 
without 
the 
other) 
is 
impossible. 
The 
creation 
is 
always 
made 
in 
pairs. 
And 
as 
we 
mentioned 
before, 
the 
pair 
has 
a 
relation 
in 
which 
one 
is 
slower 
and 
one 
faster 
than 
light, 
also 
one 
goes 
forward 
and 
the 
other 
goes 
backward 
in 
time. 
Both 
waves 
always 
act 
together, 
never 
alone. 
In 
microscopic 
objects, 
in 
the 
special 
moment 
of 
creation, 
we 
can 
see 
that 
both 
waves 
are 
linked 
together 
in 
our 
same 
world. 
But 
when 
they 
are 
separated, 
normally 
only 
a 
retarded 
wave 
appears, 
because 
the 
advanced 
wave 
is 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter, 
where 
the 
flow 
of 
time 
is 
for 
us, 
inverse. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
antiparticles 
can 
be 
seen 
to 
be 
traveling 
FTL, 
or 
traveling 
back 
in 
time, 
to 
the 
past. 
However 
in 
their 
own 
frame 
of 
reference, 
they 
always 
travel 
in 
a 
normal 
way: 
from 
the 
past 
to 
the 
future. 
The 
inverse 
process 
is 
also 
true. 
And 
so, 
an 
advanced 
wave 
may 
be 
reinterpreted 
by 
an 
observer 
as 
a 
retarded 
wave 
by 
changing 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
energy 
momentum 
and 
time 
direction 
of 
the 
wave, 
and 
so, 
an 
observer 
may 
reinterpret 
a 
retarded 
wave 
as 
an 
advanced 
wave 
or 
vice 
versa. 



236. 
Velocity 
and 
mass 
increase 
(table). 
Limits 
to 
maximum 
velocity 
According 
to 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity, 
the 
mass-speed 
relation 
of 
a 
particle 
has 
an 
ultimate 
limit, 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
in 
vacuum, 
which 
is 
impossible 
to 
reach. 
But 
there 
are 
more 
limits 
before, 
which 
are 
also 
forbidden 
to 
reach. 
At 
speeds 
near 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
mass 
is 
considerably 
big. 
The 
mass 
increasing 
factor 
is 
√10 
for 
each 
“nine” 
at 
a 
new 
decimal 
place 
in 
the 
sequence 
(√10=3.16227766), 
or 
10 
for 
every 
two 
decimal 
“nines” 
included; 
but 
this 
factor 
(10) 
is 
approached 
when 
the 
sequence 
increases 
in 
size; 
at 
the 
beginning, 
this 
value 
is 
only 
approximated.

0.999999999 
22360.6798 


We 
can 
conclude 
that 
if 
the 
speed 
is 
0.999999c 
(sequence 
with 
six 
nines), 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
mu-neutrino 
would 
be 
outside 
of 
the 
maximum 
mass 
for 
neutrinos; 
and 
so, 
the 
maximum 
possible 
speed 
in 
a 
retarded 
wave 
to 
have 
a 
successful 
experiment 
would 
have 
to 
be: 
0.999998059c, 
and 
its 
equivalent 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
1.000001941c. 
But 
there 
are 
other 
farther 
limits. 
In 
a 
sequence 
of 
56 
“nines”: 
0.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999, 
the 
supposed 
mass 
of 
the 
mu-neutrino 
would 
be 
larger, 
in 
this 
case, 
than 
the 
maximum 
value 
for 
a 
particle: 
mp/√(8π)=2.393653682x1018 
GeV. 
In 
a 



sequence 
of 
187 
“nines”, 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
neutrino 
would 
be 
larger 
than 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
whole 
Universe 
(?!), 
and 
this 
is 
completely 
forbidden. 
In 
another 
way, 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
destroyed. 
Definitively 
Einstein's 
formula 
is 
totally 
correct, 
but 
it 
needs 
other 
limits 
(aside 
from 
the 
impossibility 
to 
reach 
the 
speed 
of 
light), 
for 
it 
to 
apply. 



237. 
Range 
of 
maximum 
velocity 
of 
muon 
neutrinos 
Besides 
that, 
the 
retarded 
wave 
has 
an 
inverse 
relation 
with 
the 
advanced 
wave. 
A 
retarded 
wave 
with 
a 
long 
sequence 
of 
nine’s 
(almost 
c) 
will 
have 
a 
corresponding 
advanced 
wave, 
almost 
c. 
The 
minimal 
difference 
(almost 
zero) 
is 
much 
smaller 
than 
any 
incongruence 
in 
disturbances 
in 
measure. 
But 
even 
supposing 
we 
could 
obtain 
a 
mathematical 
result 
100% 
correct, 
there 
are 
some 
intrinsic 
conditions 
about 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
value 
of 
the 
retarded 
wave. 
Our 
calculations 
put 
the 
maximum 
speed 
of 
the 
retarded 
wave 
for 
mu-neutrino 
experiment 
in 
the 
0.999995c 
> 
v 
> 
0.9998c 
range. 


The 
corresponding 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
between 
1.000005c 
and 
1.00020004c. 
A 
sequence 
of 
25 
“nines”, 
would 
give 
a 
corresponding 
advanced 
wave 
of 
1.0000000000000000000000001c 
(almost 
c). 
Remember, 
the 
retarded 
wave 
corresponds 
to 
the 
particle 
traveling 
to 
the 
future 
(from 
the 
past) 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light; 
and 
the 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
an 
antiparticle 
traveling 
to 
its 
future 
(from 
its 
past) 
in 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
which 
in 
our 
own 
frame 
of 
reference 
would 
be 
FTL 
or 
backwards 
in 
time. 
Considering 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
retarded 
wave, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
FTL 
relation 
that 
gives 
the 
following 
results. 




238. 
Neutrinos; 
reactions. 
Two 
ways 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
Neutrinos 
are 
practically 
not 
absorbed, 
they 
neither 
have 
a 
reaction 
with 
matter; 
even 
1.5x1020 
cm 
of 
lead 
can't 
stop 
them, 
and 
normally, 
they 
can 
go 
through 
it 
without 
any 
minimum 
change 
in 
their 
movement. 
According 
to 
Paul 
Csonka's 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
stronger 
a 
particle 
interacts 
with 
the 
Universe, 
the 
stronger 
it 
participates 
in 
the 
conventional 
one-way 
flow 
of 
time. 
In 
general 
terms, 
every 
particle 
uses 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
particularly 
leptons, 
and 
especially 
neutrinos. 
They 
can't 
distinguish 
between 
past 
and 
the 
future. 
Even 
in 
our 
physical 
world, 
the 
relation 
between 
particles 
and 
antiparticles 
is 
formed. 
Besides 
that, 
considering 
our 
antimatter 
parallel 
Universe, 
we 
have 
a 
complete 
and 
permanent 
relation 
with 
it. 




It 
is 
possible 
to 
go 
to 
our 
twin 
Universe 
by 
two 
ways: 
one, 
by 
means 
of 
black 
holes, 
through 
their 
centers, 
with 
the 
possibility 
to 
change 
matter-antimatter 
(this 
was 
detailed 
in 
former 
sections 
of 
this 
book). 
However, 
there 
is 
a 
second 
way. 
The 
relation 
in 
both 
is 
to 
diminish 
time 
to 
zero 
or 
almost 
zero. 
And 
so, 
the 
other 
way 
is 
to 
increase 
the 
speed, 
preferably 
in 
a 
FTL 
connection. 
Time 
is 
zero 
or 
negative. 
In 
this 
last 
result, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
“travel 
to 
the 
past” 
but 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
and 
exclusive 
to 
particles. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
huge 
quantities 
of 
mass 
(by 
means 
of 
black 
holes), 
the 
transfer 
is 
done 
by 
sending 
antimatter 
(our 
waste) 
and 
receiving 
our 
matter 
(its 
waste) 
in 
big 
quantities, 
increasing 
the 
mass 
of 
each 
Universe 
continuously. 
In 
the 
other 
case, 
the 
process 
is 
the 
opposite: 
minimum 
quantity 
of 
matter, 
only 
particles, 
preferably 
lighter 
ones 
(like 
neutrinos); 
in 
summary, 
particle 
by 
particle. 
The 
relation 
of 
the 
wave-particle, 
FTL 
neutrino, 
or 
an 
advanced 
wave 
measured 
in 
neutrino’s 
detector, 
is 
with 
a 
wave-particle, 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
neutrino. 
But 
this 
FTL 
neutrino 
has 
extra 
energy 
and 
it 
needs 
to 
lose 
energy 
rapidly. 
At 
FTL, 
the 
travel 
to 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
is 
granted, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
twin 
Universe, 
in 
a 
simultaneous 
interchange. 
Our 
neutrino 
in 
FTL 
travel 
goes 
to 
the 
other 
Universe, 
in 
inverse 
time 
(or 
in 
our 
backward 
time), 
but 
in 
a 
normal 
time 
in 
the 
other 
Universe. 
In 
that 
way, 
the 
process 
is 
exactly 
equal 
in 
the 
opposite 
way. 
When 
our 
momentaneous 
FTL 
neutrino 
goes 
to 
the 
past 
(the 
immediate 
future 
of 
the 
antimatter 
Universe), 
an 
equivalent 
FTL 
neutrino 
in 
the 
other 
Universe 
comes 
to 
its 
“past”, 
which 
is 
our 
immediate 
future. 
Both 
lose 
energy, 
and 
so 
they 
are 
converted 
to 
normal 
neutrinos, 
traveling 
to 
the 
future 
in 
a 
normal 
way 
in 
both 
Universes. 
FTL 
is 
a 
normal 
appliance 
of 
nature, 
observing 
Einstein’s 
laws, 
to 
avoid 
increasing 
the 
speed 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
particles 
unnecessarily 
and 
dangerously, 
or 
working 
permanently 
in 
a 
futile 
effort. 
FTL 
neutrinos 
(with 
restrictions) 
are 
theoretically 
admissible, 
and 
don’t 
break 
any 
law 
of 
physics. 
Inversely, 
if 
this 
result 
were 
false, 
it 
would 
break 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
Physics. 
Remember, 
there 
is 
no 
FTL 
travel, 
neither 
FTL 
signaling; 
the 
limit 
of 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
is 
avoided; 
quantum 
mechanics 
are 
used 
in 
a 
correct 
way, 
instead 
of 
applying 
them 
erroneously 
to 
the 
macrocosmic 
reality. 


It 
is 
necessary 
to 
put 
a 
complementary 
limit, 
besides 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
limit, 
to 
the 
relation 
of 
mass 
and 
speed 
of 
matter.

and 
signaling 
The 
FTL 
neutrinos 
are 
theoretically 
possible, 
but 
this 
doesn’t 
open 
the 
possibility 
for 
time 
travel. 
First 
of 
all, 
macroscopic 
objects 
are 
outside 
of 
the 
quantum 
effect 
that 
acts 
on 
particles. 
But 
what 
about 
FTL 
signaling? 
The 
answer 
is 
the 
same. 
The 
FTL 
neutrino 
is 
only 
a 
necessary 
effect 
to 
avoid 
the 
problems 
mentioned 
before, 
but 
its 
relation 
backward 
in 
time 
is 
only 
related 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
where 
our 
mathematical 
past 
is 
its 
future. 
A 
FTL 
wave 
of 
a 
neutrino 
(or 
in 
general 
terms, 
of 
any 
particle) 
is 
like 
a 
phase 
wave 
that 
is 
cofinite 
and 
has 
a 
complete 
monotony. 
The 
only 
waves 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
send 
a 
message, 
or 
to 
use 
for 
FTL 
signaling 
are 
waves, 
in 
group, 
that 
change 
continuously. 
And 
these 
waves 
are 
retarded 
waves; 
like 
normal 
particles 
waves, 
that 
travel 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
In 
another 
sense, 
quantum 
tunneling, 
or 
quantum 
jumps 
occur 
completely 
at 
random, 
and 
this 
kind 
of 
event 
is 
totally 
useless 
for 
sending 
a 
message. 
Even 
the 
pattern, 
produced 
by 
many 
times 
of 
random 
effects, 
is 
not 
linked 
by 
FTL 
connection, 
and 
so, 
quantum 
partners 
act 
according 
Einstein's 
limit. 
FTL 
phases 
(like 
waves 
of 
particles) 
are 
perfectly 
ordered, 
utterly 
predictable, 
totally 
periodic, 
each 
of 
them 
being 
cofinitely 
long 
sine 
waves, 
with 
identical 
peaks 
and 
valleys, 
totally 
monotonous, 
a 
perfect 
order 
and 
perfect 
randomness, 
unable 
to 
send 
any 
message. 
Only 
a 
signal 
between 
these 
two 
extremes 
can 
send 
meaningful 
information. 



240. 
Quantum 
connection. 
FTL 
neutrinos 
Besides 
that, 
quantum 
connection, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
immediate 
(or 
almost 
immediate) 
and 
devoid 
of 
any 
randomness, 
is 
neither 
controllable 
nor 
asymmetric, 
and 
it 
doesn’t 
qualify 
as 
a 
“causal” 
connection. 
It 
is 
not 
forbidden 
by 
the 
postulate 
that 
demands 
a 
causal 
ordering. 
And 
so, 
even 
considering 
that 
quantum 
connection 
is 
FTL, 
it's 
not 
in 
conflict 
with 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity. 
Even 
quantum 
connections 
that 
use 
superluminal 
links 
between 
particles 
are 
totally 
inaccessible 
to 
humans 
for 
communication 
uses. 
The 
prohibition 
of 
the 
special 
theory 
of 
relativity 
is 
only 
for 
FTL 
causal 
connections, 
and 
quantum 
connection 
(or 
Bell's 
theorem) 
are 
not 
causal. 
Besides 
that, 
the 
relation 
with 
a 
backward 
time 
is 
not 
in 
our 
Universe; 
it’s 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter. 
Notwithstanding, 
our 
past 
in 
that 
Universe 
is 
its 
future, 
and 
it 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
the 
inverse 
way. 
Any 
quantum 
connection 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
(and 
vice 
versa), 
sending 
“FTL” 
signals, 
is 
changed 
in 
the 
parallel 
Universe 
to 
a 
retarded 
wave, 
forward 
into 
the 
future. 



241. 
Possibility 
to 
obtain 
FTL 
leptons 
in 
accelerators 
In 
accelerators, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
obtain 
leptons 
yielding 
a 
speed 
faster 
(but 
very 
close) 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
but 
associated 
to 
a 
wave 
slower 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
whose 
product 
gives 
1c2, 
with 
roots 
±c. 
That 
was 
explained 
before 
considering 
an 
advanced 
wave 
and 
a 
retarded 
wave 
acting 
together. 
This 
result 
can 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
range 
between 
an 
FTL 
wave 
and 
a 
STL 
wave. 
For 
example, 
we 
can 
include 
a 
range 
between 
0.999976c 
(STL) 
and 
1.00026c 
(FTL), 
but 
they 
are 
different 
waves. 
The 
exact 
relation 
would 
be: 


• 
0.999976c 
related 
to 
1.000024001c 


• 
Product: 
1c2, 
roots=±c, 
sum≅2c, 
average: 
c. 
• 
1.0000126c 
related 
to 
0.9999874c 
• 
Product: 
1c2, 
roots 
±c, 
sum≅2c, 
average: 
c. 
Nevertheless, 
it's 
always 
important 
that 
the 
speeds 
of 
both 
waves 
(retarded 
and 
advanced) 
are 
close 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
being 
slower 
and 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
respectively. 
The 
special 
range 
is 
approximately 
between: 


0.999995c 
> 
v 
> 
0.9998c 


Using 
a 
speed 
of 
0.999995c, 
its 
related 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
1.000005c. 
Using 
this 
value 
in 
the 
Opera 
experiment, 
this 
advanced 
wave 
would 
have 
traveled 
12.2 
nanoseconds 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light. 
The 
scientists 
of 
the 
Opera 
experiments 
calculated 
the 
margin 
of 
error 
at 
just 
10 
nanoseconds 
(10-8 
s). 
The 
result 
would 
be 
very 
adjusted. 
The 
speed 
needs 
to 
be 
less, 
in 
order 
for 
the 
corresponding 
advanced 
wave 
to 
be 
enough 
to 
pass 
to 
the 
other 
side 
of 
Einstein’s 
barrier. 
For 
example: 
0.99995c 
gives 
a 
FTL 
wave 
equivalent 
to 
1.000050003c 
and 
would 
travel 


14.99 
km/ 
s 
faster 
than 
light 
or 
122 
nanoseconds. 
Notwithstanding, 
it 
is 
also 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
minimum 
retarded 
wave 
(normal 
neutrino 
STL), 
because 
the 
particle 
needs 
to 
be 
conveniently 
excited. 

The 
advantage 
of 
having 
a 
corresponding 
faster 
FTL 
wave 
is 
discarded, 
because 
without 
the 
minimum 
excitement 
needed, 
the 
effect 
of 
opening 
out 
would 
be 
null. 
Example: 
0.99c: 
its 
reciprocal 
wave 
would 
be 
inexistent. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
speed 
faster 
than 
0.9998c, 
whose 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
approximately 
1.0002c. 



242. 
Impossibility 
for 
Quantum 
connection 
in 
macroscopic 
objects 
These 
FTL 
mu-neutrinos 
in 
Opera 
experiments 
are 
not 
against 
the 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity, 
neither 
with 
the 
established 
limits. 
It 
is 
only 
a 
minimum, 
but 
crucial, 
artifact 
that 
nature 
can 
use, 
by 
means 
of 
quantum 
mechanics 
rules, 
to 
protect 
the 
world, 
including 
the 
classical 
world. 
First 
of 
all, 
quantum 
mechanics 
don’t 
apply 
to 
the 
macroscopic 
world, 
where 
the 
ordered 
and 
coherent 
gravitational 
waves 
act. 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
act 
in 
the 
microscopic 
world, 
from 
the 
maximum 
mass 
of 
mPlanck, 
approximately 
equivalent 
to 
1.2x1019 
GeV 
or 
2.17x10-5 
g, 
to 
the 
minimum 
Higgs 
field 
mass 
2.82x10-14 
GeV 
or 
5.10x10-38 
g. 
approx. 
The 
heaviest 
particle 
is 
equivalent 
to 
mp/√(8π), 
in 
consequence, 
the 
full 
effect 
of 
gravity 
is 
outside 
of 
any 
particle, 
known 
or 
unknown. 
Neutrinos 
act 
only 
through 
the 
weak 
force 
(electromagnetic; 
strong 
force; 
and 
gravity 
have 
no 
effect 
on 
them). 
Moreover, 
they 
are 
not 
absorbed, 
and 
individually 
have 
almost 
no 
reaction 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world. 
They 
are 
like 
a 
ghost 
particle, 
ideal 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
privileged 
world 
of 
quantum 
mechanics. 
Macroscopic 
objects 
can 
never 
be 
accelerated 
FTL, 
even 
with 
the 
most 
powerful 
accelerators 
theoretically 
possible. 
The 
quantum 
effects 
are 
outside 
their 
sphere 
of 
action. 
Tunneling 
effect 
and 
quantum 
connection 
are 
discarded 
in 
those 
objects. 
Their 
quantum 
waves 
are 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length 
and 
so, 
even 
if 
theoretically 
and 
mathematically 
existent, 
they 
are 
outside 
of 
our 
physical 
world. 
Human 
travel 
to 
the 
past 
will 
always 
be 
science 
fiction, 
at 
least 
until 
humanity 
starts 
to 
consider 
the 
possibility 
of 
this 
as 
an 
absurdity. 
Besides 
that, 
from 
a 
theoretical 
point 
of 
view, 
all 
the 
known 
and 
unknown 
particles 
can 
use 
quantum 
effects 
to 
obtain 
FTL 
particles, 
but 
we 
should 
note 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
development 
of 
our 
technology, 
particles 
with 
minimum 
reactions 
with 
the 
4 
forces 
of 
nature 
are 
better 
subjects 
for 
this 
use. 
Gravity 
doesn't 
act 
in 
all 
of 
them. 
Neutrinos 
are 
the 
best 
choice 
and 
electrons 
are 
the 
second 
one. 
The 
system 
to 
be 
used 
is 
to 
accelerate 
them 
in 
a 
convenient 
way: 
enough 
energy 
to 
produce 
enough 
excitement, 
but 
not 
too 
much 
that 
makes 
a 



minimum 
advanced 
wave, 
impossible 
to 
test. 



243. 
Experiment 
with 
electrons 
in 
SLAC 
The 
Stanford 
Linear 
Accelerator 
(SLAC) 
was 
designed 
to 
accelerate 
electrons 
close 
to 
the 
speed 
of 
light 
(the 
electrons 
are 
the 
easiest 
particles 
to 
accelerate). 
Its 
top 
speed 
was 
equivalent 
to 
0.99999999992c, 
faster 
than 
the 
maximum 
speed 
to 
find 
the 
FTL 
effect. 
If 
that 
measure 
is 
the 
retarded 
wave, 
its 
corresponding 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
1.00000000008…c 
and 
this 
FTL 
almost 
2.5 
cm/s 
faster 
than 
the 
speed 
of 
light, 
which 
is 
impossible 
to 
test. 
To 
test 
electrons 
it 
is 
necessary: 


a) 
To 
accelerate 
them 
at 
a 
speed 
equivalent 
to 
the 
range 
described 
before, 
between 
0.9998c 
~ 
0.999995c 
b) 
To 
build 
a 
tunnel, 
because 
the 
electrons 
differ 
from 
the 
neutrinos. 
Electrons 
are 
absorbed 
and 
the 
neutrinos 
aren’t. 
It 
is 
definitely 
better 
to 
work 
with 
neutrinos. 
It 
isn't 
only 
sufficient 
to 
review 
the 
experimental 
result 
of 
Opera 
at 
CERN; 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
complete 
the 
theory.

Nobel 
prize 
in 
Physics 
2011 
The 
2011 
Nobel 
physics 
prize 
obtained 
by 
3 
US-born 
scientists: 
Saul 
Perlmutter, 
Brian 
Schmidt, 
and 
Adam 
Riess, 
was 
a 
deserved 
prize. 
They 
realized 
experimental 
measures 
that 
confirmed 
that 
the 
Universe 
is 
expanding 
at 
an 
accelerating 
pace, 
by 
analyzing 
light 
from 
dozens 
of 
exploding 
stars, 
called 
supernovas. 
They 
found 
the 
light 
was 
weaker 
than 
expected, 
signaling 
that 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
was 
accelerating. 
The 
experimental 
results 
were 
correct 
and 
so, 
the 
calculations 
are 
exact. 
However, 
the 
problem 
with 
Physics 
today 
is 
the 
theoretical 
studies. 
Normally, 
the 
experimental 
data 
is 
amazing; 
the 
mathematical 
calculations 
are 
spectacular, 
but 
the 
theoretical 
considerations 
are 
not 
at 
the 
same 
level. 
The 
problem 
consists 
in 
the 
order 
of 
the 
actual 
studies, 
not 
the 
experimental 
ones. 
First 
the 
experimental 
results 
and 
mathematical 
conclusions 
are 
obtained, 
and 
the 
theory 
generally 
comes 
later. 
And 
sometimes, 
physicists 
try 
to 
apply 
the 
concepts 
in 
a 
forced 
manner. 
Differently, 
Albert 
Einstein 
wrote 
his 
theories, 
and 
later 
found 
the 
mathematical 
calculations 
and 
after 
that, 
he 
waited 
for 
the 
experimental 
results. 
Now, 
it 
is 
generally 
the 
opposite. 
With 
the 
supernova 
experiments, 
other 
theoretical 
physicists 
are 
saying 
that 
such 
experimental 
results 
are 
a 
stunning 
revelation 
that 
suggests 
that 
the 
future 
will 
be 
nearly 
devoid 
of 
light. 
However 
Paul 
Steinhardt, 
a 
physics 
professor 
a 
Princeton 
University 
said: 
“It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
truly 
great 
discoveries 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science, 
and 
one 
whose 
implications 
are 
not 
understood.” 
And 
Robert 
Kirshner, 
a 
Harvard 
astronomer 
said: 
"Scientists 
don’t 
know 
enough 
about 
dark 
energy 
to 
predict 
what 
will 
happen 
to 
the 
universe 
hundred 
of 
billions 
of 
years 
from 
now." 
In 
this 
book 
we 
wrote 
about 
the 
cosmological 
“constant”, 
considering 
it 
a 
variable, 
its 
value 
decreasing 
over 
time 
(even 
if 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
is 
always 
increasing). 
The 
hyperbolic 
expansion 
of 
the 
Universe 
determines 
that 
it 
will 
expand 
forever; 
but 
even 
so, 
it 
will 
eventually 
collapse, 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension, 
which 
will 
be 
developed 
in 
a 
fractal 
dimension, 
reaching 
the 
complete 
formation 
of 



the 
new 
five-dimensional 
Universe 
(4 
spatial 
dimensions 
+ 
1 
time). 
It 
will 
begin 
from 
the 
maximum 
expansion, 
shrinking 
until 
it 
reaches 
the 
new 
minimum 
space, 
in 
a 
triple 
process: 
Big 
Bang, 
Big 
Crush, 
and 
Big 
Crunch. 
If 
the 
Big 
Bang 
begins 
from 
a 
non-zero 
minimum 
length, 
then 
it 
needs 
to 
stop 
at 
a 
maximum 
length, 
necessarily 
at 
α/λp 
(in 
T-symmetry), 
and 
in 
an 
almost 
symmetric 
way, 
if 
Planck 
is 
approximately 
1.616x10-33 
cm, 
our 
Universe 
will 
collapse 
at 
around 
10+32 
cm 
in 
an 
inverse 
relation; 
exactly 
at 


1x0.472366552 
cm2/1.615979906x10-33 
cm 
≅2.9231x1032 
cm≅9.7504x1021 
s 


The 
complete 
collapse 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
very 
far 
away. 
But 
our 
solar 
system 
will 
collapse 
much 
earlier. 
Even 
so, 
human 
beings 
will 
die 
before 
it. 
But 
don’t 
worry, 
there 
is 
much 
more 
time 
left 
after 
our 
lives. 



Glossary 


of 
New 
Scientific 
Terms 
and 
Concepts 
Used 
in 
this 
Book 
(In 
Order 
of 
Appearance) 


1-Cosmological 
variable: 
It’s 
the 
cosmological 
constant 
that 
has 
existed 
since 
the 
beginning 
until 
the 
final 
destiny 
of 
our 
Universe, 
but 
with 
a 
crucial 
difference: 
it’s 
a 
variable. 
It 
changes 
continuously 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
time, 
decreasing 
in 
force. 
It’s 
the 
cause 
of 
dark 
energy 
stored 
in 
the 
vacuum 
of 
space. 


2-Equivalent 
waves: 
Any 
particle 
of 
matter 
or 
cosmic 
space 
has 
two 
waves: 
one 
quantum 
and 
another 
gravitational, 
whose 
product 
is 
always 
equivalent 
to 
the 
square 
of 
Planck 
length. 
Both 
waves 
are 
real 
only 
when 
both 
of 
them 
are 
equal, 
λp 
each, 
specifically 
at 
Big 
Bang 
or 
in 
the 
cosingularity 
of 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes. 


3-Minimum 
and 
maximum 
mass: 
For 
particles, 
Planck 
mass 
is 
the 
maximum; 
and 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
neutrino 
field 
is 
the 
minimum. 
For 
the 
cosmic 
scale: 
Planck 
mass 
is 
the 
minimum 
and 
the 
mass 
in 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe 
will 
be 
the 
maximum. 


4-Paradox 
of 
measure: 
It 
is 
related 
to 
mass 
instead 
of 
length; 
and 
it 
is 
the 
maximum 
mass 
after 
which 
Quantum 
mechanics 
fail 
to 
have 
any 
effect. 
(Limit 
= 
Planck 
mass 
=2.17x10-5 
g 
or 
1.2x1019 
GeV.) 


5-Heaviest 
particle: 
Planck 
mass 
divided 
by 
√(8π) 
equivalent 
to 
4.33x10-6 
g 
or 
2.4x1018 
GeV. 
It’s 
a 
quadrupole. 


6-Fundamental 
unit 
of 
measurement 
of 
the 
Universe: 
It 
is 
space. 
All 
other 
measures 
are 
derived 
from 
it. 


7-Zero 
space 
and 
Zero 
time: 
Inexistent 
concepts 
in 
our 
physical 
Universe. 



8-Vacuum 
without 
limits: 
Equivalent 
to 
absolute 
zero 
or 
infinite 
space-time. 
This 
concept 
is 
also 
outside 
of 
physical 
existence. 


9-Vacuum 
with 
limits: 
The 
beginning 
of 
our 
Universe. 
The 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 
In 
general 
terms, 
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
Big 
Bang. 


10-Vanished 
time: 
When 
time 
and 
space 
melt 
together. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
relation 
between 
interwoven 
space-time. 
It 
is 
only 
space, 
because 
time 
is 
converted 
into 
space, 
vanishing. 
This 
process 
happens 
in 
the 
beginning 
and 
in 
the 
final 
steps 
of 
any 
Universe, 
when 
the 
time 
correction 
factors 
are 
used 
in 
the 
correspondent 
formulas. 
It’s 
the 
main 
principle 
of 
Quantum 
cosmological, 
just 
like 
the 
uncertainty 
principle 
is 
fundamental 
in 
Quantum 
mechanics. 


11-Quantum 
cosmological: 
It 
is 
a 
different 
kind 
of 
“Quantum 
mechanics” 
applied 
to 
the 
gravitational 
wave 
or 
macroscopic 
scale. 


12-Quantum 
mechanic 
gravity: 
It’s 
when 
Quantum 
mechanics 
principles 
act 
with 
gravity; 
and 
this 
is 
only 
correct 
when 
we 
use 
Planck 
length 
(In 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes). 


13-Cosingularity: 
When 
we 
use 
Plank 
length 
instead 
of 
zero 
length. 
It’s 
the 
minimum 
measure. 


14-Cozero: 
It 
is 
the 
minimum 
quantity 
in 
any 
physical 
system. 


15-Cofinity: 
It 
is 
the 
maximum 
quantity 
in 
any 
physical 
system 


16-First 
event: 
Since 
time 
doesn’t 
exist 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
Universe, 
its 
impossible 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
first 
moment; 
it 
is 
better 
to 
use 
the 
concept 
of 
first 
event. 


17-Minimum 
length: 
Planck 
length 
is 
the 
minimum 
length 
or 
cozero 
length. 
Its 
size 
is 
1.615979906x10-33 
cm 
in 
our 
Universe. 
Sub-Planck 
distances 
don’t 
exist 
in 
our 
Universe. 


18-Maximum 
length: 
According 
to 
T-symmetry, 
it 
is 
the 
approximate 



inverse 
of 
Planck 
length. 
Its 
size 
is 
2.923096699x1032 
cm. 
It 
is 
also 
known 
as 
cofinite 
length. 


19-Spatial 
correction 
factor: 
Equivalent 
to 
α 
in 
T-symmetry, 
in 
order 
to 
change 
Planck 
to 
the 
maximum 
length. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
the 
factor 
is 
e-0.75 
or 
1/e0.75. 
This 
is, 
multiply 
by 
0.472366552 
cm2 
or 
divide 
by 
2.117000017 
cm-2 
the 
inverse 
value 
of 
Planck 
length. 


20-Period: 
Time 
it 
takes 
to 
close 
any 
Universe. 
In 
our 
Universe, 
it 
will 
be 
9.750401056x1021 
s. 


21-Big 
Crush: 
when 
a 
Universe 
expands, 
arriving 
at 
the 
maximum 
limit 
or 
when 
a 
Universe 
shrinks, 
arriving 
to 
the 
minimum 
limit; 
in 
both 
cases, 
an 
enormous, 
suddenly 
accelerated 
phenomenon 
exists, 
destructive, 
almost 
instantaneous, 
that 
occurs 
in 
fractal 
dimensions, 
until 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
appears. 


22-Minimum 
limits 
modulus: 
Space 
forms 
moduli 
with 
8 
dimensional 
Universes 
each: 
7 
spatial 
+ 
1 
time, 
but 
with 
28 
components, 
instead 
of 
8: 
0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7. 
The 
limits, 
as 
abstract 
space, 
always 
remain 
even 
if 
there 
are 
extended 
dimensions. 
Their 
values 
are 
the 
corresponding 
values 
of 
λps, 
which 
are 
different 
in 
each 
Universe. 


23-Maximum 
limits 
modulus: 
Counterpart 
of 
minimum 
limits 
modulus, 
with 
the 
same 
dimensional 
Universes 
and 
the 
same 
components. 
That 
remains 
with 
maximum 
limits, 
even 
if 
there 
are 
not 
any 
developed 
dimensions. 
Matter 
will 
eventually 
reach 
them. 
Their 
values 
are 
the 
corresponding 
maximum 
lengths, 
different 
in 
each 
Universe. 
To 
draw 
both 
of 
them 
(Minimum 
and 
Maximum 
limits 
moduli), 
we 
need 
to 
use 
logarithmical 
scales. 


24-First 
Big 
Bang: 
Universe 
with 
1 
space-time 
dimensions 
(zero 
spatial 
dimension+1 
time). 
Its 
necessary 
to 
develop 
a 
time 
correction 
factor, 
besides 
that, 
the 
spatial 
correction 
factor 
it's 
not 
applicable 
in 
this 
Universe 


25-Time 
Correction 
factor: 
It 
acts 
considering 
time 
as 
inverse 
space 
(-1). 



Its 
value 
is 
fundamental 
in 
the 
first 
Big 
Bang, 
fixing 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
future 
Universes. 


26-Abstract 
Space: 
The 
original 
entity 
produced. 
It 
is 
only 
limits. 
It 
is 
also 
called 
pre-big-bang 
scenario 
or 
primordial 
space. 
It 
existed 
alone 
with 
no 
matter 
in 
existence. 
In 
the 
evolution 
of 
Universes, 
it 
exists 
in 
the 
inflection 
point, 
when 
the 
Universe 
is 
stopped 
for 
a 
“while”. 


27-Cuboide: 
In 
our 
Big 
Bang, 
before 
the 
first 
chronos, 
we 
had 
a 
flat 
scenario, 
with 
3 
limits, 
one 
in 
each 
spatial 
dimension. 
Immaterial 
and 
unbounded. 
It 
was 
a 
“cuboide” 
instead 
of 
a 
cube. 


28-Parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter: 
According 
to 
mirror 
symmetry, 
our 
Universe 
has 
a 
parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter, 
related 
to 
ours 
by 
means 
of 
a 
CPT 
symmetry 
with 
2λp 
of 
distance 
between 
them, 
λp 
in 
each 
side. 
Using 
gravitational 
waves, 
it 
is 
coherent 
and 
ordered. 
The 
formulas, 
obtaining 
λp 
and 
mp 
in 
our 
Universe, 
are 
always 
represented 
by 
two 
roots: 
(+) 
in 
our 
Universe, 
and 
(-) 
in 
the 
antimatter 
Universe. 
The 
geometrical 
relation 
is 
hyperbolic; 
or 
hyperboloid, 
considering 
the 
3rd 
spatial 
dimension. 


29-Higgs 
length: 
Every 
relation 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
particles, 
has 
a 
correspondence 
with 
space, 
according 
to 
the 
relation 
k=mλ. 
λ 
is 
then 
the 
collision 
distance, 
the 
Compton 
wavelength, 
or 
the 
Higgs 
length, 
forming 
a 
field 
with 
its 
corresponding 
mass, 
and 
deriving 
from 
it, 
the 
masses 
of 
the 
particles. 
This 
length 
is 
what 
gives 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter, 
and 
not 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
which 
gives 
mass 
only 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
force: 
W+, 
Wand 
Z0. 


30-Cosmic 
mass: 
The 
mass 
of 
the 
Universe, 
increasing 
with 
time, 
in 
direct 
relation 
with 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
cosmic 
radius. 
Relation: 
k1=R/M. 
Our 
Universe 
is 
always 
expanding 
in 
an 
accelerated 
way. 


31-Interchange 
of 
matter-antimatter: 
Theoretical 
supposition 
which 
states 
that 
antiparticles 
of 
our 
Universe 
go 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe 
and 
particles 
come 
from 
it, 
interchanging 
the 
“waste” 
in 
both 
Universes, 
thus 
increasing 
their 
matter 
in 
equal 
quantity. 



32-Stability 
of 
the 
protons: 
Normal 
protons 
are 
stable, 
because 
their 
theoretical 
time 
of 
decay 
is 
from 
about 
1033 
to 
1044 
years; 
an 
unreachable 
time, 
because 
our 
Universe 
will 
collapse 
at 
approximately 
1021 
seconds 
or 
1014 
years. 


33-Instability 
of 
heavy 
protons: 
GUT 
theory 
predicts 
the 
instability 
of 
the 
proton; 
but 
if 
the 
normal 
proton 
is 
stable; 
another 
proton 
exists 
(the 
heavy 
proton), 
existing 
around 
GUT 
energy, 
and 
it 
is 
unstable. 


34 
–Fundamental 
functions 
of 
black 
holes: 


a. 
They 
are 
the 
bridges 
necessary 
to 
interchange 
matter-antimatter 
between 
our 
Universe 
and 
its 
twin 
parallel 
Universe. 
b. 
They 
keep 
the 
entropy 
that 
will 
be 
used 
when 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
needs 
to 
appear. 
35-Naked 
co-singularity: 
The 
Big 
Bang 
is 
the 
only 
naked 
co-singularity 
in 
our 
Universe, 
whose 
size 
is 
Planck 
length. 
A 
naked 
singularity 
doesn’t 
exist, 
because 
size 
zero 
doesn’t 
exist. 


36-Cosingularity 
in 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole: 
Like 
in 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
the 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
is 
always 
Planck 
length, 
the 
minimum 
possible 
size; 
it 
is 
never 
zero. 


37-Gravitational 
collapse: 
A 
mechanism 
to 
liberate 
energy; 
using 
gravitation, 
instead 
of 
heat. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
very 
important 
event 
in 
giant 
black 
holes, 
in 
the 
center 
of 
galaxies. 


38-Neutronio: 
the 
normal 
left-handed 
neutrino 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
a 
right-
handed 
partner 
with 
an 
enormous 
mass, 
both 
of 
them 
with 
their 
correspondent 
antimatter. 
Its 
mass 
is 
around 
132 
GeV. 
Instead, 
this 
mass 
can 
be 
used 
for 
the 
LSP 
(Lightest 
superpartners), 
in 
the 
case 
the 
superpartners 
appear; 
or 
maybe 
a 
kind 
of 
a 
light 
Higgs 
boson. 
Nevertheless 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
find 
a 
heavier 
boson 
Higgs 
if 
a 
lighter 
one 
is 
found. 


39 
– 
Last 
event: 
Before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Universe 
(like 
at 
the 
beginning), 
time 



vanishes 
and 
converts 
into 
space. 
For 
that 
reason, 
it 
is 
preferable 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
last 
event 
instead 
of 
the 
last 
moment. 


40-Higgs 
modified 
field: 
each 
particle 
with 
its 
correspondent 
antiparticle 
form 
a 
doublet 
(leptons) 
or 
a 
quartet 
(two 
doublets) 
of 
quarks. 
Independently, 
if 
a 
Higgs 
boson 
is 
formed 
or 
not, 
the 
particle 
gets 
mass 
according 
to 
its 
corresponding 
Higgs 
length, 
using 
the 
uncertainty 
principle: 
ℏ/cλ=m. 
The 
Higgs 
field 
is 
actually 
applied 
when 
a 
Higgs 
boson 
appears. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
Higgs 
modified 
field 
gives 
mass 
to 
all 
particles 
of 
matter, 
according 
to 
their 
correspondent 
Higgs 
lengths. 


41– 
Code 
of 
String 
Universes: 
4n2-4n+2; 
or 
(2n-1)2+1; 
or 
(8(n)(n-1))/2+2. 
In 
which 
the 
sequence 
is 
n 
from 
1 
to 
8, 
their 
results: 
2, 
10, 
26, 
50, 
82, 
122, 
170, 
and 
226. 


42-Masses 
of 
normal 
neutrinos: 
They 
are 
no 
longer 
supposed 
to 
be 
massless. 
Their 
theoretical 
values 
are 
approximately: 


Electron 
neutrino: 
1.13x10-14 
GeV 


Mu 
neutrino: 
2x10-9 
GeV 


Tau 
neutrino: 
1x10-6 
GeV 


43-Massless 
particles 
of 
matter: 
Don’t 
exist, 
because 
they 
are 
against 
the 
uncertainty 
principle; 
primordial 
in 
quantum 
mechanics. 


44-One 
family: 
The 
existence 
of 
3 
or 
6 
families 
of 
particles 
is 
an 
apparent 
supposition. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
as 
one 
family, 
but 
with 
different 
manifestations 
according 
to 
the 
length; 
and 
in 
an 
inverse 
relation 
with 
their 
masses. 


45-Numbers 
of 
Higgs 
bosons: 
There 
are 
3 
Higgs 
bosons, 
where 
the 
particles 
of 
force 
acquire 
mass 
(Gravitational, 
strong, 
and 
weak). 
Their 
fields, 
with 
masses 
of 
approximately: 
1.2x1019 
GeV, 
2.22x1016 
GeV, 
and 
482.4 
GeV 
respectively. 


46-Heavier 
scale: 
Another 
scale 
also 
integrated 
by 
3 
families, 
in 
a 
symmetric 
way, 
similar 
to 
the 
lighter 
scale, 
but 
with 
much 
heavier 
masses. 
Its 
value 
is 
between 
1.2x1019 
GeV 
and 
482.4 
GeV, 
the 
places 
of 
the 
gravitational 



Higgs 
boson 
and 
weak 
Higgs 
boson, 
respectively. 


47-Code 
of 
Higgs 
bosons: 
∅!, 
1!, 
2!, 
3!, 
4!. 
∅! 
is 
used 
instead 
of 
0!, 
because 
0! 
is 
1, 
and 
origin 
is 
cozero 
(Planck), 
that 
means: 
∅, 
1, 
2, 
6, 
24, 
according 
to 
the 
detail: 
∅ 
(origin) 
is 
the 
gravitational 
boson. 
1 
is 
the 
Strong 
boson. 
2 
is 
the 
electromagnetic 
control; 
(no 
boson). 
6 
is 
the 
weak 
or 
electroweak 
boson. 
24 
is 
the 
new 
gravitational 
boson 
(outside 
of 
our 
Universe, 
immediately 
after 
its 
collapse). 


48-Lengths 
of 
the 
sequence 
of 
Higgs 
bosons: 
k= 
-24π 
= 
1.615979906x10-33 
cm 
k= 
-22π 
= 
8.731046397x10-31 
cm 
k= 
-20π 
= 
4.717334068x10-28 
cm 
k= 
-12π 
=4.01992527x10-17 
cm 
k= 
+24π 
=2.923096699x1032 
cm 


Using 
Ockham’s 
razor, 
k+24π 
disappears 
and 
k-20π 
is 
just 
a 
term 
used 
to 
maintain 
the 
sequence, 
but 
Higgs 
bosons 
don’t 
appear 
in 
it. 
And 
so, 
the 
real 
values 
correspond 
to 
k-24π, 
k-22π, 
and 
k-12π; 
only 
three 
Higgs 
bosons. 


49-Two 
scales 
for 
particles 
of 
force: 
There 
are 
two 
scales 
for 
particles 
of 
force: 
heavier 
(with 
mass) 
and 
lighter 
(massless), 
except 
for 
the 
photon, 
that 
will 
never 
have 
mass; 
and 
the 
photino, 
which 
doesn’t 
exist. 
Actual 
experiments 
only 
consider 
the 
heavier 
scale 
in 
weak 
force, 
and 
the 
lighter 
scale 
in 
gravitational 
and 
strong 
forces. 


50-Co-minimum 
limit: 
Limit 
obtained 
when 
we 
add 
the 
time 
correction 
factor 
in 
its 
corresponding 
formula. 
It 
is 
longer 
than 
the 
real 
minimum 
limit 
or 
Planck 
length. 


51-Co-maximum 
limit: 
Limit 
obtained 
when 
we 
add 
the 
time 
correction 
factor 
in 
its 
corresponding 
formula. 
It 
is 
smaller 
than 
the 
real 
maximum 
measure. 



52-Multidimensional 
Universes: 
The 
reason 
why 
our 
Universe 
has 
4 
extended 
dimensions 
(space-time) 
is 
because 
it 
was 
developed 
in 
order: 
1, 
2, 
3, 
and 
4 
dimensional 
Universe, 
and 
5, 
6, 
7, 
and 
8 
will 
develop 
later. 
In 
any 
case, 
Universe 
with 
one 
space-time 
dimension 
was 
the 
first 
Universe, 
and 
the 
simplest. 
The 
Universe 
normally 
begins 
from 
a 
simpler 
to 
a 
more 
complex 
entity. 
It 
is 
more 
logical 
to 
suppose 
it 
began 
from 
one 
dimension, 
and 
then 
to 
2, 
3, 
and 
4, 
than 
to 
break 
10 
dimensions 
into 
4 
and 
6. 


53-Zero 
spatial 
dimensions: 
Although 
zero 
space 
doesn’t 
exist, 
zero 
spatial 
dimensions 
can 
exist 
when 
space 
is 
not 
developed 
and 
an 
independent 
axis 
or 
direction 
of 
space 
is 
not 
formed. 
There 
is 
no 
length 
longer 
than 
Planck 
length 
in 
the 
whole 
development 
of 
that 
Universe. 


54-Hook 
union: 
System 
used 
by 
nature 
in 
different 
opportunities, 
unifying 
different 
scales, 
where 
the 
last 
value 
of 
the 
first 
scale 
is 
bigger 
than 
the 
first 
value 
of 
the 
second 
scale 
(or 
interchanging 
places) 
forming 
a 
hook, 
and 
maintaining 
both 
scales 
together. 


55-Dimensional 
wedge: 
To 
close 
the 
8th 
Universe 
(7+1) 
of 
the 
first 
modulus, 
we 
use 
a 
dimensional 
wedge; 
a 
small 
piece, 
equivalent 
to 
the 
time 
correction 
factor; 
to 
close 
the 
first 
modulus, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
to 
form 
the 
1st 
Universe 
of 
the 
second 
modulus, 
unifying 
both 
moduli. 


56-Dimensional 
package: 
8 
dimensional 
Universes 
form 
a 
dimensional 
modulus. 
Seven 
moduli 
form 
a 
dimensional 
package. 


57-A 
“while”: 
Any 
Universe 
needs 
movement 
and 
it 
is 
always 
either 
expanding 
or 
contracting, 
except 
for 
a 
“while”, 
when 
a 
complete 
new 
dimension 
appears; 
producing 
an 
inflection 
point; 
when 
movement 
ceases, 
and 
change 
its 
direction. 


58-Fractal 
dimension: 
After 
the 
collapse 
of 
a 
Universe, 
a 
time 
exists 
where 
the 
new 
dimension 
begins 
to 
increase 
step 
by 
step, 
in 
fractions 
of 
unit 
(fractal), 
until 
the 
new 
dimension 
completely 
appears. 



59-Contracting 
interphase: 
Big 
Crush 
in 
fractal 
dimension, 
from 
an 
even 
to 
an 
odd 
spatial 
Universe. 


60-Expanding 
interphase: 
Big 
Crush 
in 
fractal 
dimension, 
from 
an 
odd 
to 
an 
even 
numbered 
spatial 
Universe. 


61-Gravity 
dimensional 
Universes: 
Based 
on 
gravitational 
waves; 
ordered, 
coherent, 
derived 
one 
by 
one 
(the 
former 
and 
the 
next); 
in 
beautiful, 
physical 
and 
mathematical 
sequences. 
Any 
dimensional 
Universe 
begins 
with 
a 
gravity 
boson 
in 
the 
first 
event, 
and 
ends 
with 
another 
one 
in 
the 
last 
event. 


62-Footing 
and 
foundation 
of 
any 
Universe: 
All 
human 
constructions 
require 
foundations 
and 
footings 
with 
a 
resistance 
proportional 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
mass 
that 
needs 
to 
support; 
but 
the 
Universe 
was 
built 
in 
a 
completely 
different 
manner, 
a 
very 
efficient 
one. 
Its 
footing 
is 
simply 
a 
vacuum 
with 
limits, 
very 
tiny, 
existing 
in 
the 
entire 
Universe, 
each 
with 
a 
minimum 
limit 
of 
Planck 
length; 
impossible 
to 
shrink 
or 
stretch. 
It 
is 
the 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario. 


63-Efficient 
nature: 
Nature 
is 
always 
totally 
efficient. 
Any 
inefficient 
natural 
process 
detailed, 
is 
simply 
a 
product 
of 
human 
ignorance, 
or 
the 
product 
of 
not 
having 
full 
knowledge 
of 
the 
real 
facts. 


64-Squaroide: 
The 
foundation 
or 
support 
of 
the 
Universe 
with 
two 
spatial 
dimensions. 


65-Objective 
of 
inflation: 
The 
real 
objective 
of 
the 
inflation 
of 
the 
Universe 
is 
to 
create 
matter 
and 
antimatter, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
residual 
heat 
produced 
by 
inflation. 
The 
elimination 
of 
monopoles 
and 
the 
flatness 
of 
the 
Universe 
are 
only 
apparent 
effects 
of 
inflation. 


66-Minimum 
density 
of 
Universe: 
It 
will 
be 
in 
the 
last 
event. 
Equivalent 
to 
around 
3.76366x10-38 
g/cm3; 
approximately 
the 
density 
of 
the 
Higgs 
field 
of 
the 
electron 
neutrino; 
confirming 
that 
this 
particle 
of 
matter 
is 
the 
lightest 
subatomic 
particle. 



67-π 
plus: 
Our 
Universe 
has 
a 
minimum 
limit 
or 
Planck 
length, 
whose 
value 
in 
natural 
logarithms 
is 
-75.50536654. 
Since 
the 
exponential 
factor 
is 
-24π, 
we 
can 
obtain 
including 
the 
spatial 
correction 
factor, 
a 
value 
of 
π 
plus 
equivalent 
to 
-3.146056939. 


68-π 
minus: 
Our 
Universe 
has 
a 
maximum 
limit. 
Its 
value 
in 
inverse 
natural 
logarithm 
is 
-74.75536654, 
and 
the 
value 
of 
π 
minus 
is 
-3.114806939, 
both 
values 
are 
used 
to 
find 
the 
mass 
scales. 


69-Scales 
of 
mass: 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
use 
the 
uncertainty 
principle: 
ℏ=mcλ 
or 
ℏ/cλ=m. 
π 
minus 
is 
used 
for 
known 
particles, 
except 
in 
k-12π. 
π 
plus 
is 
used 
for 
unknown 
particles; 
and 
known 
particles 
only 
in 
k-12 
π. 


70-Relation 
between 
densities: 
The 
average 
density 
of 
a 
Higgs 
field 
in 
a 
determined 
step 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
average 
density 
of 
the 
Universe 
in 
its 
corresponding 
step. 


λ2=Rλpor 
λ2=Rαλp 
Using 
π 
plus 
Using 
π 
minus 


71-Permanent 
accelerated 
expansion: 
It 
started 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
will 
continue 
until 
our 
Universe 
collapses. 
Space 
is 
always 
stretching 
faster 
than 
light 
in 
our 
Universe. 


72-Real 
job 
of 
Higgs 
weak 
boson: 
It 
is 
fundamental 
for 
the 
electroweak 
theory; 
it 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking, 
between 
electromagnetic 
and 
weak 
forces; 
gives 
mass 
to 
W± 
and 
Z0; 
left 
the 
photon 
with 
no 
mass 
and 
leads 
the 
level 
k-12π 
with 
π 
plus. 
(Maximum 
value 
of 
the 
field: 
482.397 
GeV 
and 
it 
has 
a 
relation 
with 
t 
and 
b 
quarks, 
and 
their 
correspondent 
antiparticles, 
and 
nothing 
more. 
It 
is 
not 
the 
god 
particle, 
neither 
its 
role 
is 
to 
give 
mass 
to 
the 
particles 
of 
matter. 


73-Higgs 
fields 
and 
heat: 
Heat 
can 
destroy 
matter, 
but 
not 
space. 
Even 
more, 
Higgs 
fields 
are 
“abstract” 
spaces. 
The 
supposition 
of 
the 
Standard 
Model 
that 
the 
Higgs 
field 
is 
destroyed 
by 
heat 
is 
not 
proven, 
and 
moreover, 



it 
doesn’t 
give 
any 
explanation 
as 
to 
why. 


74-Instability 
of 
Higgs 
bosons: 
All 
the 
Higgs 
bosons 
are 
unstable. 
They 
would 
rapidly 
decay 
to 
lighter 
particles, 
which 
would 
interact 
among 
them 
and 
possibility 
undergo 
subsequent 
decays. 
The 
Higgs 
bosons 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
changing 
of 
phases 
of 
a 
substance. 
A 
thermal 
energy 
with 
a 
temperature 
gradient 
exists; 
but 
in 
a 
change 
of 
phase, 
energy 
at 
constant 
temperature 
also 
exists, 
named 
latent 
heat. 
Higgs 
bosons 
only 
exist 
in 
a 
change 
of 
phase, 
or 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking. 


75-Relation 
between 
the 
cosmological 
“constant” 
and 
the 
age 
of 
Universe: 
If 
the 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ 
is 
exact, 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
will 
be 
exact, 
according 
to 
the 
formula: 
Λ=6/R2 
If 
Λ=2.979371259x10-56 
cm-2, 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
15 
billion 
years. 
If 
Λ=3.571626263x10-56 
cm-2, 
the 
age 
of 
the 
Universe 
would 
be 
13.7 
billion 
years. 


76-Expansion 
or 
explosion 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang: 
The 
explosion 
needs 
to 
be 
substituted 
by 
a 
silent 
(like 
almost 
all 
the 
phenomena 
of 
nature) 
high 
expansion, 
from 
cozero 
space, 
cofinite 
density 
of 
energy, 
and 
cozero 
entropy, 
at 
Planck 
length, 
in 
3 
spatial 
and 
one 
time 
dimensions. 
The 
expansion 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
a 
natural 
condition 
of 
any 
odd 
spatial 
dimension 
Universe, 
and 
will 
expand 
permanently 
in 
a 
hyperbolic 
way 
(in 
an 
accelerated 
expansion) 
until 
the 
maximum 
space 
is 
reached, 
and 
it 
will 
begin 
to 
close, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension, 
step 
by 
step, 
in 
fractal 
dimension. 


77-Fundamental 
restrictions 
of 
our 
Universe: 
Any 
Universe 
has 
two 
fundamental 
restrictions 
relative 
to 
space. 
(And 
all 
the 
different 
measures, 
including 
secondary 
restrictions 
are 
derived 
from 
it. 
None 
single 
entity 
in 
our 
Universe 
(neither 
space 
as 
a 
whole) 
can 
have, 
travel 
or 
decrease 
to 
a 
length 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length 
(1.615979906x10-33 
cm); 
or 
to 
a 
length 
larger 
than 
the 
maximum 
limit 
(2.923096699x1032 
cm). 


78-Graviton 
and 
collapse 
of 
the 
quantum 
wave: 
Even 
a 
single 
graviton 
collapses 
the 
quantum 
wave. 
And 
so, 
the 
gravitational 
waves 
and 



electromagnetic 
waves 
are 
incompatible, 
and 
only 
coincide 
in 
the 
first 
chronos 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang. 


79-Door 
to 
any 
Universe: 
Gravity 
is 
the 
entrance 
door 
and 
exit 
door 
to 
any 
Universe. 
Its 
value 
decreases 
when 
the 
number 
of 
spatial 
dimensions 
increases. 


80-Existence 
of 
the 
superpartners: 
The 
Superstring 
theory 
needs 
that 
superpartners 
masses 
not 
to 
be 
very 
much 
larger 
than 
the 
Z 
boson 
mass, 
in 
order 
for 
its 
whole 
proposed 
approach 
to 
be 
valid. 
But 
there 
is 
not 
much 
room 
for 
them 
to 
appear; 
and 
if 
they 
did 
appear 
in 
such 
a 
small 
room, 
this 
would 
be 
ugly 
and 
totally 
asymmetric. 
The 
“normal” 
particles 
have 
a 
big 
room 
and 
very 
different 
masses, 
and 
if 
the 
superpartners 
appear, 
they 
would 
need 
to 
pile 
up 
in 
a 
very 
reduced 
space. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
expand 
the 
available 
room. 


81-Higgs 
fields 
range: 
Higgs 
fields 
form 
particles 
from 
the 
Big 
Bang 
(space 
ø 
or 
Planck 
length), 
to 
the 
maximum 
space 
of 
the 
microcosmos 
era, 
exactly 
0.687289278 
cm. 
And 
so, 
0 
< 
H 
< 
1 
and 
0 
cm 
< 
λ 
< 
1 
cm. 
or 
1.615979906x10-33 
cm 
≤ 
λ 
≤ 
0.687289278 
cm 


82-Black 
holes 
and 
parallel 
Universes: 
An 
enormous 
number 
of 
black 
holes 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 
each 
black 
hole 
has 
a 
different 
parallel 
Universe. 
Every 
black 
hole 
(1016 
~1018) 
in 
our 
Universe, 
communicates 
with 
different 
sections 
of 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
the 
same, 
and 
only 
one, 
equal 
to 
ours, 
in 
a 
CPT 
connection. 


83-Formulas 
of 
the 
cosmological 
“constant”: 
Λ=6/R2 
or 
(8πGδv)/c2 
in 
cm-2 
Λ=8πGδv 
or 
(6c2)/R2 
in 
s-2. 
Where 
δv 
is 
the 
average 
vacuum 
density 
of 
the 
Universe, 
in 
a 
determined 
time. 


84-Difference 
between 
theoretical 
and 
experimental 
value 
of 
Λ: 
The 
experimental 
result, 
compared 
to 
the 
theoretical 
value 
of 
Λ, 
has 
a 
difference 
of 



approximately 
10120, 
the 
biggest 
difference 
in 
a 
quantity 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science. 
The 
explanation 
for 
that 
is 
very 
simple, 
considering 
Λ 
variable. 
The 
theoretical 
value 
is 
obtained 
by 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
and 
so, 
is 
its 
exact 
value 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang. 
The 
experimental 
result 
is 
obtained 
in 
this 
time, 
when 
the 
Universe 
is 
much 
longer 
and 
Λ 
is 
much 
smaller. 
Its 
difference 
is 
very 
similar. 
Ex. 
(R12)/R2 
= 
(approx. 
2x1056 
cm2)/(2.611391056x10-66 
cm2) 
= 
difference 
≅ 
7.65x10121 


85-Size 
of 
the 
dimensions: 
Each 
dimension 
in 
any 
universe 
has 
the 
same 


initial 
footing, 
but 
they 
are 
different 
between 
other 
universes. 
86-Center 
of 
Black 
holes: 
Since 
the 
Big 
Bang 
has 
a 
nonzero 
size, 
specifically 
Planck 
length, 
in 
each 
of 
the 
3 
spatial 
dimensions 
(6 
ways, 
two 
in 
each 
dimension). 
If 
we 
use 
Planck 
length 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes, 
we 
can 
obtain 
a 
gateway 
to 
our 
parallel 
universe. 
This 
is, 
where 
time 
in 
our 
Universe 
comes 
to 
an 
end, 
time 
in 
the 
parallel 
universe 
just 
begins. 
But 
we 
need 
to 
apply 
CPT 
connections. 


87-Pores 
of 
the 
cosmic 
space: 
The 
cosmic 
space 
has 
pores 
(size 
= 
λp) 
like 
the 
human 
being. 
Planck 
length 
is 
impossible 
to 
fill 
up. 
It 
is 
an 
open 
space, 
unbounded. 
It 
is 
a 
vacuum 
with 
limits 
that 
exists 
in 
the 
entire 
Universe. 


88-Big 
Bang: 
two 
black 
holes 
attached: 
The 
Big 
Bang 
acted 
like 
a 
black 
hole 
attached 
to 
another 
in 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
each 
with 
size 
λp. 
Each 
hole 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
black 
and 
white. 
By 
a 
procedure 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
explored 
more, 
the 
double-mechanism 
of 
sending 
antimatter 
(our 
waste) 
to 
the 
other 
Universe, 
and 
receiving 
antimatter 
(its 
waste), 
in 
the 
same 
quantity. 
The 
Big 
Bang, 
like 
two 
united 
black 
holes, 
gives 
a 
formula 
to 
calculate 
the 
mass 
of 
our 
Universe, 
the 
double 
of 
the 
corresponding 
mass 
of 
a 
black 
hole 
(Rc2/G=M 
and 
Rc2/2G=M). 
The 
quantitative 
process 
is 
obtained 
using 
the 
circular 
motion 
ratio 
(1.5 
of 
the 
Schwarzschild 
radius), 
in 
the 
initial 
formation 
of 
particle-antiparticle 
pairs. 


89-Emission 
of 
particles 
by 
means 
of 
intense 
gravity: 
Near 
the 
surface 
of 
medium 
and 
big 
black 
holes, 
gravity 
is 
so 
intense 
that 
the 
vacuum 
(or 
ergosphere 
space) 
can 
intervene 
with 
a 
continual 
stream 
of 
newly 
created 



particle-antiparticle 
pairs. 
In 
the 
classic 
Newtonian 
sense, 
this 
is 
impossible, 
but 
in 
Quantum 
mechanics 
or 
in 
Quantum 
cosmological, 
it 
could 
be 
possible. 
If 
gravity 
is 
a 
warping 
of 
space-time, 
we 
could 
say 
that 
gravity 
induces 
the 
creation 
of 
space-time 
and 
this 
space-time 
induces 
the 
creation 
of 
matter. 
The 
action 
of 
gravity 
can 
produce 
heat 
(strike, 
friction, 
compression, 
and 
collapse). 


90-Gravity 
force 
and 
Universes: 
The 
relation 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
and 
moreover, 
with 
the 
other 
extradimensional 
Universes, 
is 
by 
means 
of 
the 
gravitational 
force. 
In 
any 
creation 
of 
a 
Universe 
or 
in 
its 
destruction, 
in 
the 
beginning 
and 
in 
the 
end, 
gravity 
has 
the 
same 
value 
as 
the 
other 
forces. 


91-Duality 
of 
gravity: 
The 
dual 
nature 
of 
all 
the 
forces, 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
attraction-repulsion 
is 
common 
in 
all 
of 
them, 
including 
gravity. 
And 
so, 
gravity 
would 
be 
attractive 
at 
shorter 
distances 
and 
would 
be 
repulsive 
at 
cosmic 
distances. 


92-Lost 
Information: 
Information 
is 
never 
lost, 
neither 
in 
the 
center 
of 
black 
hole, 
because 
“singularities” 
don’t 
exist. 
The 
center 
of 
any 
black 
hole 
is 
Planck-sized 
and 
so, 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information 
is 
never 
lost, 
besides 
that, 
the 
center 
of 
black 
holes 
produces 
a 
wormhole 
to 
the 
other 
Universe 
(parallel 
Universe 
of 
antimatter). 
The 
evaporation 
doesn’t 
lose 
mass 
or 
information, 
because 
mass 
is 
recovered 
in 
an 
inverse 
process. 


93-Prequarks: 
Quarks 
and 
leptons 
cannot 
be 
divided, 
but 
using 
big 
gravity 
in 
highly 
sensitive 
experiments, 
prequarks 
could 
be 
detected 
inside 
them. 


94-New 
“aether” 
(ether) 
theory: 
Einstein 
showed 
that 
ether 
was 
unnecessary; 
but 
he 
never 
said 
that 
ether 
doesn’t 
exist. 
Considering 
that 
nature 
abhors 
the 
vacuum, 
the 
ether, 
even 
if 
it 
is 
irrelevant 
in 
our 
physical 
reality, 
exists 
as 
a 
convenient 
medium, 
filling 
virtually 
the 
“space” 
inside 
the 
correspondent 
holes 
of 
Planck 
length, 
with 
no 
physical 
measure. 
But 
String 
theory 
speaks 
of 
more 
spatial 
dimensions 
than 
3, 
and 
so, 
ether 
needs 
to 
be 
rediscovered, 
but 
in 
higher 
dimensions. 


95-Flat 
dimension: 
Just 
at 
the 
beginning, 
in 
the 
pre-big-bang 
scenario, 
the 



dimensions 
are 
flat. 
But 
this 
is 
not 
true 
with 
the 
developed 
Universe, 
where 
the 
Universe 
will 
be 
almost 
flat, 
but 
never 
flat. 


96-Entropy 
in 
Universes: 
When 
the 
Universe 
is 
stretching 
or 
shrinking, 
the 
entropy 
increases 
until 
the 
last 
event, 
where 
a 
big 
quantity 
of 
entropy 
has 
been 
formed. 
But 
that 
entropy 
is 
consumed 
to 
form 
a 
new 
dimension. 
And 
so, 
the 
new 
system 
begins 
with 
almost 
zero 
entropy, 
which 
starts 
to 
increase 
again, 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
new 
Universe; 
and 
so 
the 
same 
process 
begins 
all 
over 
again. 


97-Eternal 
expansion: 
In 
both, 
the 
Big 
Bang 
and 
the 
Big 
Crunch, 
symmetrical 
conditions 
exist. 
If 
the 
Universe 
expanded 
forever, 
we 
would 
consider 
the 
future 
to 
be 
absolutely 
unlike 
the 
past. 
This 
is 
anti-natural 
and 
ugly, 
and 
would 
also 
be 
against 
simpler 
mathematics. 
The 
only 
reason 
for 
the 
Universe 
to 
expand 
forever, 
would 
be 
if 
it 
began 
from 
zero 
space. 
This 
is 
impossible. 
String 
theory 
affirms 
that 
the 
Big 
Bang 
began 
with 
λp, 
as 
a 
minimum 
space, 
and 
according 
to 
T-symmetry, 
the 
Universe 
will 
recollapse 
after 
it 
arrives 
to 
its 
maximum 
length; 
and 
a 
new 
dimension 
appears. 


98-Kaluza-Klein 
graviton: 
Only 
in 
the 
first 
chronos 
of 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
gravity 
is 
strong 
and 
has 
the 
same 
value 
as 
the 
other 
forces. 
In 
this 
moment, 
the 
first 
Higgs 
boson 
appears, 
gravitationally 
united. 
The 
graviton 
acquires 
mass, 
just 
in 
the 
first 
chronos; 
or 
in 
other 
words, 
this 
“heavy 
graviton” 
is 
the 
Kaluza-Klein 
graviton, 
traveling 
between 
dimensions 
(in 
our 
case, 
from 
two 
spatial 
dimensions, 
to 
three), 
that 
some 
physicists 
are 
looking 
in 
the 
LHC 
collider. 
However, 
to 
find 
it, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
arrive 
to 
Planck 
length, 
which 
is 
too 
far 
for 
now. 
The 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
placed 
the 
gravity 
force 
outside 
after 
this 
point, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
weak 
in 
the 
development 
of 
our 
Universe 
until 
the 
last 
event. 
Remember, 
gravity 
is 
the 
only 
force 
that 
communicates 
among 
branes. 


99-k-12π 
duality: 
In 
the 
k-12π 
point 
there 
are 
2 
measures, 
considering 
π 
plus 
and 
π 
minus, 
and 
so, 
there 
two 
Higgs 
fields 
will 
be 
formed. 



In 
a 
“hook” 
interchange, 
the 
heavier 
field 
is 
the 
last 
term 
of 
the 
first 
scale; 
and 
the 
lighter 
field 
is 
the 
first 
term 
of 
the 
second 
scale. 


100-Gravity 
in 
particle 
accelerators: 
Particle 
accelerators 
test 
the 
microcosmos 
using 
the 
strong, 
weak 
and 
electromagnetic 
forces. 
The 
gravitational 
force 
is 
totally 
ignored. 
The 
minimum 
limits 
of 
Universes 
with 
less 
dimensions, 
are 
considerably 
bigger 
than 
our 
λp. 
New, 
highly 
sensitive 
gravitational 
experiments 
using 
big 
gravity 
would 
look 
for 
those 
larger 
curled-up 
dimensions, 
and 
before 
that, 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
to 
see 
the 
supposed 
prequarks 
forming 
the 
different 
particles. 


101-Obtaining 
λp 
measure: 
Using 
the 
constants 
of 
nature, 
obtained 
experimentally: 


λ=±√((Gh)/c3)≅±1.616x10-33 
cm 


Theoretically, 
using 
only 
space: 
e-8πn-n/28 
where 
n=3. 
e-75.50536654=1.615979906x10-33 
cm 


102-Extradimensional 
influences: 
Their 
influences 
have 
relation 
only 
with 
λ 
and 
in 
consequence 
with 
the 
masses. 
Their 
actions 
are 
derived 
from 
the 
number 
of 
components 
of 
dimensions, 
or 
degrees 
of 
freedom; 
not 
from 
their 
sizes 
or 
shapes. 


103-Force 
to 
unite 
prequarks: 
The 
same 
energy 
used 
to 
form 
the 
Big 
Bang 
in 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
the 
fundamental 
force 
(gravity, 
strong, 
electromagnetic 
and 
weak 
force 
combined) 
or 
hypergravity, 
is 
the 
same 
force 



used 
to 
unite 
the 
prequarks 
into 
the 
fundamental 
particles. 
All 
the 
particles 
in 
our 
Universe, 
(including 
any 
object 
and 
black 
holes) 
have 
an 
“interaction” 
point 
of 
Planck 
length. 


104-Quadrupole: 
The 
quadrupole 
(4 
poles) 
determines 
4 
quarks 
of 
the 
same 
strength, 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
united 
by 
the 
fundamental 
hypergravity 
force, 
where 
the 
4 
forces 
are 
together. 


105-Valence: 
The 
residual 
number, 
after 
subtracting 
each 
of 
the 
moduli 
of 
8 
dimensions 
and 
their 
multiples, 
and 
so: 
10 
is 
8+2 
and 
26 
is 
(8+8+8)+2, 
etc. 


106-Point 
particles: 
To 
consider 
simple 
particles 
like 
leptons 
or 
quarks, 
with 
no 
structure, 
is 
to 
consider 
the 
existence 
of 
point 
particles, 
which 
don’t 
exist. 
In 
our 
world 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
particles, 
different 
to 
our 
Universe 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
to 
exist. 
Although 
the 
fundamental 
string 
(1+1) 
is 
the 
basic 
entity 
of 
space, 
we 
live 
in 
a 
world 
of 
three 
spatial 
dimensions, 
and 
so, 
each 
particle, 
has 
a 
substructure 
of 
3 
virtual 
strings, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
hidden. 
The 
String 
theory 
already 
considered 
a 
3-string 
vertex. 


107-Travel 
to 
the 
past: 
With 
our 
physical 
body, 
carrying, 
or 
bringing 
information 
is 
impossible. 


108-Multidimensional 
travel: 
Using 
another 
spatial 
dimension 
(>3) 
has 
a 
real 
limitation. 
First 
of 
all, 
the 
wormholes 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
travel 
are 
smaller 
than 
Planck 
length, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
access 
them. 
Besides 
that, 
in 
higher 
dimensional 
Universes 
our 
physical 
entity 
cannot 
survive. 
And 
there 
is 
no 
physical 
solution 
for 
that; 
at 
least, 
for 
now. 


109-The 
death 
of 
our 
Universe: 
The 
Universe, 
as 
a 
whole, 
will 
eventually 
die. 
If 
the 
Big 
Bang 
had 
a 
beginning, 
it’s 
impossible 
for 
it 
to 
live 
forever. 
If 
our 
planet 
dies, 
or 
our 
sun 
dies, 
or 
even 
if 
our 
galaxy 
dies, 
a 
future 
human 
civilization 
could 
travel 
to 
other 
places 
in 
our 
same 
Universe. 
But 
in 
the 
final 
moment 
of 
the 
collapse 
of 
our 
Universe, 
the 
modulus 
will 
be 
open, 
tearing 
the 
fabric 
of 
space, 
and 
a 
new 
spatial 
dimension 
will 
begin 
to 
appear. 
This 
will 
be 
a 
cosmic 
cataclysm, 



and 
the 
entire 
Universe 
will 
collapse 
chaotically. 
All 
the 
space-time 
will 
be 
cracked, 
and 
all 
the 
spatial 
tridimensional 
entities, 
practically 
our 
whole 
Universe, 
with 
its 
entire 
physical 
context 
will 
be 
destroyed 
and 
crushed. 


110-Time 
of 
death 
of 
our 
Universe: 
The 
time 
of 
the 
destruction 
of 
our 
Universe 
is 
far 
away. 
We 
live 
according 
to 
arithmetical 
time, 
and 
in 
the 
logarithmic 
time 
that 
our 
Universe 
uses; 
the 
following 
very 
tiny 
fraction 
of 
it 
is 
more 
than 
all 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
past 
time. 
Even 
if 
the 
Universe 
only 
had 
a 
remnant 
minimal 
fraction 
left 
to 
exist, 
there 
would 
still 
be 
billions, 
or 
even 
trillions 
of 
years, 
for 
it 
to 
end. 
The 
maximum 
life 
of 
our 
Universe, 
would 
be, 
its 
period. 
The 
time 
is 
9.75401055x1021 
seconds 
or 
3.089734259x1014 
years. 


111-Twin 
Universe: 
Our 
parallel 
Universe 
(only 
one) 
is 
in 
a 
CPT 
connection 
with 
our 
Universe. 
The 
symmetry 
is 
exact 
and 
the 
interchange 
of 
matter 
needs 
to 
be 
in 
exact 
equilibrium. 
Even 
when 
a 
FTL 
neutrino, 
from 
our 
Universe, 
goes 
to 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
another 
FTL 
neutrino, 
from 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
comes 
to 
our 
Universe, 
leaving 
the 
quantity 
of 
mass 
intact 
in 
both. 
Also 
with 
the 
interchange 
of 
matter-antimatter 
by 
means 
of 
a 
black 
hole, 
although 
the 
mass 
increases, 
there 
is 
an 
exact 
symmetry, 
because 
in 
both 
Universes 
the 
increase 
of 
mass 
is 
exactly 
the 
same. 


112-Appearance 
of 
the 
mass 
and 
the 
fundamental 
constants: 
Just 
at 
the 
beginning, 
in 
the 
first 
chronos, 
“after” 
the 
pre-Big 
Bang 
scenario, 
mass 
appears, 
and 
the 
constants 
G, 
ℏ, 
and 
c 
are 
established, 
until 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe. 
The 
space 
in 
all 
three 
dimensions 
begins 
to 
stretch, 
movement 
appears 
and 
the 
accelerating 
expansion 
acts. 


113-Hyperforce: 
Prequarks 
can 
never 
be 
in 
isolation. 
But 
they 
have 
another 
property. 
When 
the 
fundamental 
particles 
are 
in 
movement, 
the 
prequarks, 
like 
virtual 
strings, 
practically 
“disappear” 
integrating 
themselves 
with 
the 
movement. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
see 
them 
is 
to 
arrive 
to 
a 
distance 
close 
to 
λp, 
where 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
see 
a 
Planck 
unit, 
stopped 
or 
almost 
stopped, 
and 
to 
see 
the 
three 
prequarks 
unit 
in 
an 
“interaction 
point”. 
The 
force 
that 
joins 
them 
is 
the 
force 
of 
gravity 
at 
Planck 
length, 
a 
hyperforce. 
This 
force 
is 
the 
entrance 
door 
to 
our 
Universe, 
and 
all 
the 
four 
forces 
are 
united 
in 
a 
same 
value. 



114-Support 
of 
the 
Universes: 
One 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe 
is 
formed 
by 
normal 
strings, 
(like 
straight 
lines), 
and 
this 
is 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
typical 
pieces 
of 
the 
foundation 
of 
this 
Universe. 
Gravity 
doesn’t 
change 
with 
distance, 
and 
because 
of 
that, 
it 
will 
always 
be 
constant. 
Since 
the 
two 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe 
have 
different 
gravity 
according 
to 
distance, 
the 
curvature 
of 
these 
Universes 
always 
changes, 
and 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
use 
them 
as 
the 
“foundations” 
of 
the 
Universe, 
by 
repeating 
them. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
use 
the 
“straight 
form” 
of 
each 
and 
any 
particular 
pre-Big 
Bang 
Universe. 


115-Packaged 
fraction 
of 
each 
Universe: 
A 
quantitative 
relation 
between 
the 
spherical 
“volume” 
and 
“straight” 
volume 
exists; 
whose 
value 
is 
1 
or 
< 
1. 
Each 
bigger 
dimension 
has 
a 
decreased 
packaged 
fraction. 
In 
the 
0 
and 
1 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universes, 
it 
is 
1; 
in 
our 
Universe, 
it 
is 
approximately 
0.52; 
in 
the 
seven 
spatial 
dimensional 
Universe, 
its 
value 
is 
approximately 
0.036. 


116-The 
fundamental 
bit 
will 
never 
be 
lost: 
In 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
just 
at 
the 
beginning, 
in 
the 
fundamental 
bit 
of 
information, 
all 
the 
tendency 
for 
future 
evolution 
is 
marked, 
the 
constants 
and 
the 
conceptual 
laws 
have 
been 
regulated 
and 
the 
initial 
conditions 
will 
rule 
the 
dynamic 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universe. 
This 
basic 
and 
fundamental 
information 
will 
never 
be 
lost 
during 
the 
life 
of 
our 
Universe. 
The 
minimum 
area 
is 
(Planck 
length)2= 
2.6113091056x10-66 
cm2 
and 
it’s 
in 
this 
area 
where 
the 
first 
information 
is 
imprinted, 
the 
fundamental 
bit, 
will 
never 
be 
destroyed, 
until 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Universe. 
According 
to 
Quantum 
mechanics, 
the 
position 
and 
momentum 
of 
a 
particle 
can 
never 
be 
exactly 
detailed, 
but 
this 
is 
unnecessary 
to 
know 
the 
overall 
behavior 
of 
the 
system. 
The 
general 
information, 
fixed 
in 
the 
first 
unit 
of 
information, 
is 
enough 
to 
determine 
the 
dynamical 
behavior 
of 
the 
system; 
in 
this 
case, 
our 
Universe. 


117-Jumping 
dimensional 
Universe: 
If 
any 
Universe 
works 
with 
jumps, 
not 
all 
dimensions 
can 
form 
Universes. 
The 
modular 
relation 
is 
8[(n(n-1))/2]+ 
valence; 
where 
(n) 
is 
the 
dimensional 
modulus, 
beginning 
from 
one 
(1); 
and 
valence 
is 
the 
kind 
of 
space-time 
Universe. 



Even 
using 
all 
the 
consecutive 
numbers, 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
form 
Universes 
with 
all 
the 
dimensions. 


118-The 
most 
complex 
structure: 
As 
always, 
a 
hook 
is 
necessary 
with 
the 
next 
group. 
Each 
more 
complex 
aggregation 
diminishes 
its 
number 
of 
components 
(8 
dimensions 
a 
modulus; 
7 
moduli, 
a 
package 
etc.). 
A 
cofinite 
dimensional 
Universe 
would 
be 
the 
most 
complex 
structure 
possible. 


119-First 
modulus: 
The 
first 
modulus, 
fundamental 
Universes, 
or 
first 
sequence 
are: 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4, 
5, 
6, 
7, 
and 
8 
(in 
space-time). 
The 
actual 
step 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
Universes 
is 
number 
4. 
The 
natures 
of 
the 
fundamental 
ingredients 
of 
different 
Universes 
are: 


Valence 


1 
0+1 
Monopoles 
2 
1+1 
Strings 
3 
2+1 
Membranes 
4 
3+1 
Particles 
(3 
sphere) 
5 
4+1 
Macroparticles 
(4 
sphere) 
6 
5+1 
Per-particles 
(5 
sphere) 
7 
6+1 
Super-particles 
(6

8 
7+1 
Hyper-particles 
(7 
sphere) 


120-The 
cofinite 
dimensional 
Universe: 
This 
is 
the 
largest 
dimensional 
Universe 
and 
would 
be 
only 
one. 
It 
can’t 
increase 
its 
number, 
neither 
duplicate 
at 
the 
least; 
but 
this 
most 
complex 
structure 
with 
cofinite 
dimensions 
needs 
time 
to 
exist, 
and 
so, 
it 
would 
always 
be 
limited. 
Infinity 
is 
outside 
of 
any 
physical 
Universe. 


121-Higgs 
fields 
energy: 
They 
have 
the 
total 
energy 
of 
particles, 
compound, 
or 
doublet 
scalar 
field. 
They 
form 
a 
Higgs 
ocean, 
composed 
by 
a 
lot 
of 
Higgs 
fields 
in 
any 
particular 
time 
of 
our 
Universe, 
except 
at 
the 
Big 
Bang, 
when 
there 
was 
only 
one 
Higgs 
field. 



122-Possible 
new 
particles 
in 
LHC: 
The 
experiments 
on 
the 
LHC 
need 
to 
look 
around 
two 
points 
in 
both 
k-12π 
scales, 
where 
two 
particles 
could 
be 
discovered: 
the 
Higgs 
weak 
boson, 
at 
around 
482.4 
GeV 
(as 
a 
maximum 
and 
most 
probable 
value, 
and 
no 
less 
than 
384.88 
GeV) 
and 
a 
new 
type 
of 
heavier 
neutral 
particle, 
the 
neutronio, 
at 
around 
132 
GeV. 
Using 
these 
values 
to 
look 
for 
these 
particles 
is, 
at 
least, 
better 
than 
blindly 
looking 
for 
them. 


123-Conclusion 
over 
Opera 
Experiments 
at 
CERN: 
Independently 
of 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Opera 
Experiments 
at 
CERN, 
particle 
physicists 
could 
detect 
mu 
neutrinos 
travelling 
faster 
than 
light. 
But 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
way 
to 
send 
information 
back 
in 
time, 
erasing 
the 
line 
between 
past 
and 
present, 
and 
disappearing 
the 
fundamental 
principle 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
doesn’t 
exist. 
But 
FTL 
neutrinos 
don’t 
discard 
the 
Special 
relativity 
laws, 
even 
more, 
they 
confirm 
them. 
Quantum 
mechanics 
accept 
the 
possibility 
to 
pass 
the 
light 
barrier, 
avoiding 
it, 
but 
never 
reaching 
it. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
put 
a 
particle 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
Einstein 
barrier, 
without 
having 
to 
pass 
through 
the 
region 
of 
infinite 
mass, 
by 
means 
of 
the 
tunneling 
effect. 


124-Travel 
to 
the 
past: 
The 
backward 
in 
time 
relation 
of 
the 
FTL 
neutrino 
experiments 
is 
only 
related 
to 
our 
parallel 
Universe, 
where 
our 
mathematical 
past 
is 
its 
future. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
exchanges 
messages 
with 
them. 
It 
is 
also 
impossible 
to 
travel 
to 
the 
past 
physically, 
in 
our 
same 
Universe. 


125-Relation 
mass-speed 
in 
squared 
form: 


m12=(m02)/(1-v2⁄c2) 
If 
v>c 
and 
m0=1 
and 
c=1. 
-m12=1/(v2-1) 


-m12=(mi)2 
or 
(-mi)2 
But 
it 
also 
has 
2 
real 
values. 


-m12=(m1)(-m1) 


This 
last 
equation 
indicates, 
matter 
in 
our 
Universe, 
and 
antimatter 
related 
to 



our 
parallel 
Universe. 


Particles 
and 
antiparticles 
act 
like 
a 
united 
process 
of 
advanced 
waves 
(>c) 
and 
retarded 
waves 
(<c). 
To 
obtain 
a 
FTL 
neutrino, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
obtain 
a 
retarded 
neutrino 
as 
a 
complementary 
partner. 
The 
addition 
of 
both 
waves 
is 
practically 
2c 
and 
the 
product, 
1c2, 
average 
±c. 
The 
way 
to 
obtain 
FTL 
neutrinos 
is 
to 
accelerate 
them 
in 
a 
convenient 
way, 
to 
use 
enough 
energy 
to 
produce 
enough 
excitement, 
but 
not 
too 
much 
to 
avoid 
a 
minimum 
advanced 
wave, 
which 
is 
impossible 
to 
test. 
Range 
between 
0.999995c 
> 
v 
> 
0.9998c 
in 
retarded 
wave; 
equivalent 
to 
1.000005c 
< 
v 
<1.00020004c 
in 
advanced 
wave.

At 
the 
beginning, 
all 
the 
spatial 
dimensions 
of 
a 
Universe 
are 
equal. 
But 
are 
different 
between 
other 
Universes' 
with 
different 
dimensionality.

and 
not 
4-4. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
draw 
the 
moduli 
using 
logarithmical 
scale. 
Relation 
of 
dimensions: 
around 
1010 
between 
one 
and 
the 
next. 
Both 
moduli 
are 
inverse. 
Less 
dimension 
means, 
a 
larger 
minimum 
limit 
and 
a 
shorter 
maximum 
limit. 
According 
to 
the 
differences 
among 
dimensions 
of 
different 
Universes, 
the 
number 
of 
components 
(degrees 
of 
freedom) 
is 
not 
8, 
it's 
28. 
(0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8). 
But

is 
zero

5. 
The 
light 
barrier 
has 
two 
sides. 
According 
to 
the 
Opera 
experiment, 
the 
FTL 
neutrino 
is 
an 
advanced 
wave, 
related 
to 
a 
retarded 
wave. 
(1.000024574c 
and 
0.999975426c). 
Particle-antiparticle 
pair 
in 
our 
world, 
can 
be 
separated 
in 
a 
retarded 
wave 
(in 
our 
world) 
and 
an 
advanced 
wave 
(in 
the 
parallel 
Universe). 
Tachyons 
are 
inexistent 
in 
our 
world, 
because 
always 
need 
to 
travel 
FTL 
and 
they 
have 
no 
retarded 
wave. 
An 
antiparticle 
traveling 
backwards 
in 
time 
can 
be 
reinterpreted 
as 
a 
particle 
traveling 
forwards 
in 
time. 
The 
2 
waves 
always 
occur 
in 
pairs, 
and 
can 
be 
released, 
with 
a 
relation 
with

Both

or 
particles 
linked 
together 
in 
our 
same 
world. 
Antiparticles 
can 
be 
seen 
and 
measured 
as 
traveling 
FTL 
or 
traveling 
back 
in 
time 
(to 
the 
past) 
in 
the 
neutrino 
detectors, 
but 
in 
its 
own 
frame 
or 
reference, 
they 
travel 
from 
past 
to 
the 
future. 
The 
inverse 
process 
is 
also 
true.

The 
relation 
between 
mass 
and 
velocity 
is 
correct 
but 
it 
needs 
new 
limits 
(much 
before 
the 
impossibility 
to 
reach 
the 
speed 
of 
light) 
to 
apply 
it.

Range

> 
v 
> 
0.9998c. 
The 
correspondent 
advanced 
wave 
would 
be 
between 
1.000005c 
and 
1.00020004c. 
11. 
Neutrino 
has 
almost 
no 
reaction 
with 
matter. 
Particles, 
especially 
leptons, 
cannot 
distinguish 
between 
past 
direction 
and 
the 
future. 
Two 
ways 
to 
go 
to 
our 
twin 
Universe: 
increasing 
colossally 
the 
mass 
through 
black 
holes 
or 
traveling 
in 
a 
FTL 
connection. 
FTL 
neutrino 
has 
extra 
energy, 
and 
needs 
to 
lose 
energy 
rapidly. 
It 
realizes 
an 
interchange 
with 
our 
parallel 
Universe. 
Graphs. 
Our 
momentaneous 
FTL 
travel 
to 
the 
past 
(the 
immediate 
future 
of 
the 
antimatter 
Universe), 
and 
an 
equivalent 
neutrino, 
FTL, 
in 
the 
other 
Universe, 
comes 
to 
its 
“past”, 
or 
our 
future. 
By 
losing 
energy 
they 
are 
converted 
into 
normal 
neutrinos. 
12. 
FTL 
neutrinos 
doesn’t 
open 
the 
time 
travel 
possibility, 
neither 
time 
signaling. 
Explanations. 
13. 
Quantum 
connection 
doesn’t 
qualify 
as 
a 
causal 
connection 
and 
it 
is 
not 
in 
conflict 
with 
Special 
theory 
of 
relativity. 
Any 
Quantum 
connection, 
even 
sending 
FTL 
neutrinos, 
are 
changed 
in 
the 
parallel 
Universe, 
to 
a 
retarded 
wave, 
forward 
from 
the 
past 
to 
the 
future; 
and 
vice 
versa. 
14. 
In 
accelerators, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
obtain 
leptons 
yielding 
a 
speed 
FTL. 
The 
acceleration 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
minimum 
value 
to 
excite 
the 
particle, 
and 
not 
too 
big, 
in 
order 
not 
to 
produce 
an 
advanced 
wave 
too 
adjusted 
and 
impossible 
to 
test. 
15. 
Some 
consideration 
about 
Special 
theory 
of 
Relativity 
and 
Quantum 
mechanics 
rules. 
Impossibility 
to 
use 
quantum 
connection 
in 
macroscopic 
objects, 
as 
the 
human 
body. 
Consideration 
on 
the 
particles 

and 
FTL 
motion. 


16. 
Experiment 
with 
electrons 
in 
SLAC. 
Its 
top 
speed 
was 
farther 
to 
the 
maximum 
limit 
to 
find 
the 
FTL 
effect. 
The 
advanced 
wave 
was 
only 
2.5 
cm/s 
faster 
than 
speed 
of 
light, 
impossible 
to 
test. 
Definitely 
is 
better 
to 
work 
with 
neutrinos. 
Opera 
experiment 
at 
CERN 
had 
the 
special 
values 
to 
obtain 
momentaneously 
FTL 
neutrinos, 
but 
its 
results 
are 
in 
doubt. 
In 
any 
way, 
it 
is 
theoretically 
possible 
to 
find 
FTL 
neutrinos, 
but 
with 
restrictions. 
17. 
Nobel 
prize 
in 
physics 
2011, 
a 
deserved 
price. 
The 
experimental 
values 
were 
exact. 
The 
Universe 
is 
in 
an 
accelerated 
expansion. 
But 
the 
Universe 
will 
eventually 
collapse.
