On 
the 
Experience 
of 
Time 


In 
the 
present 
article, 
we 
shall 
be 
concerned 
with 
all 
those 
immediate 
experiences 
upon 
which 
our 
knowledge 
of 
time 
is 
based. 
Broadly 
speaking, 
two 
pairs 
of 
relations 
have 
to 
be 
considered, 
namely, 
(a) 
sensation 
and 
memory, 
which 
give 
time-relations 
between 
object 
and 
subject, 
(b) 
simultaneity 
and 
succession, 
which 
give 
time-relations 
among 
objects. 
It 
is 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
not 
to 
confuse 
time-relations 
of 
subject 
and 
object 
with 
time-relations 
of 
object 
and 
object; 
in 
fact, 
many 
of 
the 
worst 
difficulties 
in 
the 
psychology 
and 
metaphysics 
of 
time 
have 
arisen 
from 
this 
confusion. 
It 
will 
be 
seen 
that 
past, 
present, 
and 
future 
arise 
from 
time-relations 
of 
subject 
and 
object, 
while 
earlier 
and 
later 
arise 
from 
time-relations 
of 
object 
and 
object. 
In 
a 
world 
in 
which 
there 
was 
no 
experience 
there 
would 
be 
no 
past, 
present, 
or 
future, 
but 
there 
might 
well 
be 
earlier 
and 
later. 
Let 
us 
give 
the 
name 
of 
mental 
time 
to 
the 
time 
which 
arises 
through 
relations 
of 
subject 
and 
object, 
and 
the 
name 
physical 
time 
to 
the 
time 
which 
arises 
through 
relations 
of 
object 
and 
object. 
We 
have 
to 
consider 
what 
are 
the 
elements 
in 
immediate 
experience 
which 
lead 
to 
our 
knowledge 
of 
these 
two 
sorts 
of 
time, 
or 
rather 
of 
time-relations. 


Although, 
in 
the 
finished 
logical 
theory 
of 
time, 
physical 
time 
is 
simpler 
than 
mental 
time, 
yet 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
experience 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
mental 
time 
must 
come 
first. 
The 
essence 
of 
physical 
time 
is 
succession; 
but 
the 
experience 
of 
succession 
will 
be 
very 
different 
according 
as 
the 
objects 
concerned 
are 
both 
remembered, 
one 
remembered 
and 
one 
given 
in 
sense, 
or 
both 
given 
in 
sense. 
Thus 
the 
analysis 
of 
sensation 
and 
memory 
must 
precede 
the 
discussion 
of 
physical 
time. 


Before 
entering 
upon 
any 
detail, 
it 
may 
be 
well 
to 
state 
in 
summary 
form 
the 
theory 
which 
is 
to 
be 
advocated. 


1. 
Sensation 
(including 
the 
apprehension 
of 
present 
mental 
facts 
by 
introspection) 
is 
a 
certain 
relation 
of 
subject 
and 
object, 
involving 

acquaintance, 
but 
recognizably 
different 
from 
any 
other 
experienced 
relation 
of 
subject 
and 
object. 


2. 
Objects 
of 
sensation 
are 
said 
to 
be 
present 
to 
their 
subject 
in 
the 
experience 
in 
which 
they 
are 
objects. 
3. 
Simultaneity 
is 
a 
relation 
among 
entities, 
which 
is 
given 
in 
experience 
as 
sometimes 
holding 
between 
objects 
present 
to 
a 
given 
subject 
in 
a 
single 
experience. 
4. 
An 
entity 
is 
said 
to 
be 
now 
if 
it 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
what 
is 
present 
to 
me, 
i.e., 
with 
this, 
where 
"this" 
is 
the 
proper 
name 
of 
an 
object 
of 
sensation 
of 
which 
I 
am 
aware. 
5. 
The 
present 
time 
may 
be 
defined 
as 
a 
class 
of 
all 
entities 
that 
are 
now. 
[This 
definition 
may 
require 
modification; 
it 
will 
be 
discussed 
later.] 
6. 
Immediate 
Memory 
is 
a 
certain 
relation 
of 
subject 
and 
object, 
involving 
acquaintance, 
but 
recognizably 
different 
from 
any 
other 
experienced 
relation 
of 
subject 
and 
object. 
7. 
Succession 
is 
a 
relation 
which 
may 
hold 
between 
two 
parts 
of 
one 
sensation, 
for 
instance 
between 
parts 
of 
a 
swift 
movement 
which 
is 
the 
object 
of 
one 
sensation; 
it 
may 
then, 
and 
perhaps 
also 
when 
one 
or 
both 
objects 
are 
objects 
of 
immediate 
memory, 
be 
immediately 
experienced, 
and 
extended 
by 
inference 
to 
cases 
where 
one 
or 
both 
of 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
relation 
are 
not 
present. 
8. 
When 
one 
event 
is 
succeeded 
by 
another, 
the 
first 
is 
called 
earlier 
and 
the 
second 
later. 
9. 
An 
event 
which 
is 
earlier 
than 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present 
is 
called 
past, 
and 
an 
event 
which 
is 
later 
than 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present 
is 
called 
future. 
This 
ends 
our 
definitions, 
but 
we 
still 
need 
certain 
propositions 
constituting 
and 
connecting 
the 
mental 
and 
physical 
time-series. 
The 
chief 
of 
these 
are: 
a. 
Simultaneity 
and 
succession 
both 
give 
rise 
to 
transitive 
relations; 
simultaneity 
is 
symmetrical, 
while 
succession 
is 
asymmetrical, 
or 
at 
least 

gives 
rise 
to 
an 
asymmetrical 
relation 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
it. 


b. 
What 
is 
remembered 
is 
past. 
c. 
Whenever 
a 
change 
is 
immediately 
experienced 
in 
sensation, 
parts 
of 
the 
present 
are 
earlier 
than 
other 
parts. 
(This 
follows 
logically 
from 
the 
definitions.) 
d. 
It 
may 
happen 
that 
A 
and 
form 
part 
of 
one 
sensation, 
and 
likewise 
and 
C, 
but 
when 
C 
is 
an 
object 
of 
sensation 
A 
is 
an 
object 
of 
memory. 
Thus 
the 
relation 
"belonging 
to 
the 
same 
present" 
is 
not 
transitive, 
and 
two 
presents 
may 
overlap 
without 
coinciding. 
The 
above 
definitions 
and 
propositions 
must 
now 
be 
explained 
and 
amplified. 


1. 
Sensation, 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
psychophysics, 
will 
be 
concerned 
only 
with 
objects 
not 
involving 
introspection. 
But 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
all 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
present 
may 
advantageously 
be 
combined 
under 
one 
head, 
and 
therefore, 
if 
there 
is 
introspective 
knowledge 
of 
the 
present, 
we 
will 
include 
this 
with 
sensation. 
It 
is 
sometimes 
said 
that 
all 
introspective 
knowledge 
is 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
memory; 
we 
will 
not 
now 
consider 
this 
opinion, 
but 
will 
merely 
say 
that 
if 
introspection 
ever 
gives 
acquaintance 
with 
present 
mental 
entities 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
senses 
give 
acquaintance 
with 
present 
physical 
entities, 
then 
such 
acquaintance 
with 
mental 
entities 
is, 
for 
our 
purposes, 
to 
be 
included 
under 
the 
head 
of 
sensation. 
Sensation, 
then, 
is 
that 
kind 
of 
acquaintance 
with 
particulars 
which 
enables 
us 
to 
know 
that 
they 
are 
at 
the 
present 
time. 
The 
object 
of 
a 
sensation 
we 
will 
call 
a 
sense-datum. 
Thus 
to 
a 
given 
subject 
sense 
data 
are 
those 
of 
its 
objects 
which 
can 
be 
known, 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
their 
relation 
to 
the 
subject, 
to 
be 
at 
the 
present 
time. 
The 
question 
naturally 
arises: 
how 
do 
we 
know 
whether 
an 
object 
is 
present 
or 
past 
or 
without 
position 
in 
time? 
Mere 
acquaintance, 
as 
we 
decided 
in 
considering 
imagination, 
does 
not 
necessarily 
involve 
any 
given 
temporal 
relation 
to 
the 
subject. 
How, 
then, 
is 
the 
temporal 
relation 
given? 
Since 
there 
can 
be 
no 
intrinsic 
difference 
between 
present 
and 
past 
objects, 
and 
yet 
we 
can 
distinguish 
by 
inspection 
between 
objects 
given 
as 
present 
and 
those 
given 
as 
past, 
it 
follows 
from 
the 
criterion 
set 
forth 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 



preceding 
chapter 
that 
the 
relation 
of 
subject 
to 
object 
must 
be 
different, 
and 
recognizably 
different, 
according 
as 
the 
object 
is 
present 
or 
past. 
Thus 
sensation 
must 
be 
a 
special 
relation 
of 
subject 
and 
object, 
different 
from 
any 
relation 
which 
does 
not 
show 
that 
the 
object 
is 
at 
the 
present 
time. 
Having 
come 
to 
this 
result, 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
accept 
"sensation" 
as 
an 
ultimate, 
and 
define 
the 
present 
time 
in 
terms 
of 
it; 
for 
otherwise 
we 
should 
have 
to 
use 
some 
such 
phrase 
as 
"given 
as 
at 
the 
present 
time," 
which 
would 
demand 
further 
analysis, 
and 
would 
almost 
inevitably 
lead 
us 
back 
to 
the 
relation 
of 
sensation 
as 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
the 
phrase 
"given 
as 
at 
the 
present 
time." 
For 
this 
reason, 
we 
accept 
sensation 
as 
one 
of 
the 
ultimates 
by 
means 
of 
which 
time-relations 
are 
to 
be 
defined. 


2. 
Our 
theory 
of 
time 
requires 
a 
definition, 
without 
presupposing 
time, 
of 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
"one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience." 
This 
question 
has 
been 
already 
considered 
in 
a 
previous 
article, 
where 
we 
decided 
that 
"being 
experienced 
together" 
is 
an 
ultimate 
relation 
among 
objects, 
which 
is 
itself 
sometimes 
immediately 
experienced 
as 
holding 
between 
two 
objects. 
We 
cannot 
analyze 
this 
into 
"being 
experienced 
by 
the 
same 
subject," 
because 
A 
and 
B 
may 
be 
experienced 
together, 
and 
likewise 
B 
and 
C, 
while 
A 
and 
C 
are 
not 
experienced 
together: 
this 
will 
happen 
if 
A 
and 
B 
form 
part 
of 
one 
"specious 
present," 
and 
like 
wise 
B 
and 
C, 
but 
A 
is 
already 
past 
when 
C 
is 
experienced. 
Thus 
"being 
experienced 
together" 
is 
best 
taken 
as 
a 
simple 
relation. 
Although 
this 
relation 
is 
sometimes 
perceived, 
it 
may 
of 
course 
also 
hold 
when 
it 
is 
not 
perceived. 
Thus 
"one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience" 
will 
be 
the 
experience 
of 
all 
that 
group 
of 
objects 
which 
are 
experienced 
together 
with 
a 
given 
object. 
This, 
however, 
still 
contains 
a 
difficulty, 
when 
viewed 
as 
a 
definition, 
namely 
that 
it 
assumes 
that 
no 
object 
is 
experienced 
twice, 
or 
throughout 
a 
longer 
time 
than 
one 
specious 
present. 
This 
difficulty 
must 
be 
solved 
before 
we 
can 
proceed. 
Two 
opposite 
dangers 
confront 
any 
theory 
on 
this 
point, 
(a) 
If 
we 
say 
that 
no 
one 
object 
can 
be 
experienced 
twice, 
or 
rather, 
to 
avoid 
what 
would 
be 
obviously 
false, 
that 
no 
one 
object 
can 
be 
twice 
an 
object 
of 
sense, 
we 
have 
to 
ask 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
"twice." 
If 
a 
time 
intervenes 
between 
the 
two 
occasions, 
we 
can 
say 
that 
the 
object 
is 
not 
numerically 
the 
same 
on 
the 
two 
occasions; 
or, 
if 
that 
is 
thought 
false, 
we 
can 
say 
at 
least 
that 
the 
experience 
is 
not 
numerically 
the 
same 
on 
the 
two 
occasions. 
We 
can 
then 
define 
"one 



(momentary) 
total 
experience" 
as 
everything 
experienced 
together 
with 
"this," 
where 
"this" 
is 
an 
experience, 
not 
merely 
the 
object 
of 
an 
experience. 
By 
this 
means, 
we 
shall 
avoid 
the 
difficulty 
in 
the 
case 
when 
"twice" 
means 
"at 
two 
times 
separated 
by 
an 
interval 
when 
the 
experience 
in 
question 
is 
absent." 
But 
when 
what 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
same 
experience 
persists 
through 
a 
longer 
continuous 
period 
than 
one 
specious 
present, 
the 
over 
lapping 
of 
successive 
specious 
presents 
introduces 
a 
new 
difficulty. 
Suppose, 
to 
fix 
our 
ideas, 
that 
I 
look 
steadily 
at 
a 
motionless 
object 
while 
I 
hear 
a 
succession 
of 
sounds. 
The 
sounds 
A 
and 
B, 
though 
successive, 
may 
be 
experienced 
together, 
and 
therefore 
my 
seeing 
of 
the 
object 
while 
I 
hear 
these 
sounds 
need 
not 
be 
supposed 
to 
constitute 
two 
different 
experiences. 
But 
the 
same 
applies 
to 
what 
I 
see 
while 
I 
hear 
the 
sounds 
B 
and 
C. 
Thus 
the 
experience 
of 
seeing 
the 
given 
object 
will 
be 
the 
same 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
sound 
A 
and 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
sound 
C, 
although 
these 
two 
times 
may 
well 
not 
be 
parts 
of 
one 
specious 
present. 
Thus 
our 
definition 
will 
show 
that 
the 
hearing 
of 
A 
and 
the 
hearing 
of 
C 
from 
parts 
of 
one 
experience, 
which 
is 
plainly 
contrary 
to 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
one 
experience. 
Suppose, 
to 
escape 
this 
conclusion, 
we 
say 
that 
my 
seeing 
the 
object 
is 
a 
different 
experience 
while 
I 
am 
hearing 
A 
from 
what 
it 
is 
while 
I 
am 
hearing 
B. 
Then 
we 
shall 
be 
forced 
to 
deny 
that 
the 
hearing 
of 
A 
and 
the 
hearing 
of 
B 
form 
parts 
of 
one 
experience. 
In 
that 
case, 
the 
perception 
of 
change 
will 
become 
inexplicable, 
and 
we 
shall 
be 
driven 
to 
greater 
and 
greater 
subdivision, 
owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
changes 
are 
constantly 
occurring. 
We 
shall 
thus 
be 
forced 
to 
conclude 
that 
one 
experience 
cannot 
last 
for 
more 
than 
one 
mathematical 
instant, 
which 
is 
absurd. 


b. 
Having 
been 
thus 
forced 
to 
reject 
the 
view 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
one 
experience 
must 
be 
confined 
within 
one 
specious 
present, 
we 
have 
now 
to 
consider 
how 
we 
can 
define 
"one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience" 
on 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
a 
numerically 
identical 
experience 
may 
persist 
throughout 
a 
longer 
period 
than 
one 
specious 
present. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
no 
one 
experience 
will 
now 
suffice 
for 
definition. 
All 
that 
falls 
within 
one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience 
must 
belong 
to 
one 
specious 
present, 
but 
what 
is 
experienced 
together 
with 
a 
given 
experience 
need 
not, 
on 
our 
present 
hypothesis, 
fall 
within 
one 
specious 
present. 
We 
can, 
however, 
avoid 
all 
difficulties 
by 
defining 
"one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience" 
as 
a 
group 
of 
objects 
such 
that 
any 
two 
are 
experienced 
together, 
and 
nothing 
outside 
the 
group 
is 
experienced 
together 
with 
all 
of 
them. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
if 
A 
and 
B, 
though 

not 
simultaneous, 
are 
experienced 
together, 
and 
if 
B 
and 
C 
likewise 
are 
experienced 
together, 
C 
will 
not 
belong 
to 
one 
experience 
with 
A 
and 
B 
unless 
A 
and 
C 
also 
are 
experienced 
together. 
And 
given 
any 
larger 
group 
of 
objects, 
any 
two 
of 
which 
are 
experienced 
together, 
there 
is 
some 
one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience 
to 
which 
they 
all 
belong; 
but 
a 
new 
object 
cannot 
be 
pronounced 
a 
member 
of 
this 
total 
experience 
until 
it 
has 
been 
found 
to 
be 
experienced 
together 
with 
all 
the 
members 
of 
the 
group. 
A 
given 
object 
will, 
in 
general, 
belong 
to 
many 
different 
(momentary) 
total 
experiences. 
Suppose, 
for 
example, 
the 
sounds 
A, 
B, 
C, 
D, 
E 
occur 
in 
succession, 
and 
three 
of 
them 
can 
be 
experienced 
together. 
Then 
C 
will 
belong 
to 
a 
total 
experience 
containing 
A, 
B, 
C, 
to 
one 
containing 
B, 
C, 
D, 
and 
to 
one 
containing 
C, 
D, 
E. 
In 
this 
way, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
specious 
present 
lasts 
for 
a 
certain 
length 
of 
time, 
experience 
permits 
us 
to 
assign 
the 
temporal 
position 
of 
an 
object 
much 
more 
accurately 
than 
merely 
within 
one 
specious 
present. 
In 
the 
above 
instance, 
C 
is 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
specious 
present 
of 
A, 
B, 
C, 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
that 
of 
B, 
C, 
D, 
and 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
that 
of 
C, 
D, 
E. 
And 
by 
introducing 
less 
discrete 
changes 
the 
temporal 
position 
of 
C 
can 
be 
assigned 
even 
more 
accurately. 


We 
may 
thus 
make 
the 
following 
definitions: 


"One 
(momentary) 
total 
experience," 
is 
a 
group 
of 
experiences 
such 
that 
the 
objects 
of 
any 
two 
of 
them 
are 
experienced 
together, 
and 
anything 
experienced 
together 
with 
all 
members 
of 
the 
group 
is 
a 
member 
of 
the 
group. 


The 
"specious 
present" 
of 
a 
momentary 
total 
experience 
is 
the 
period 
of 
time 
within 
which 
an 
object 
must 
lie 
in 
order 
to 
be 
a 
sense-datum 
in 
that 
experience. 


This 
second 
definition 
needs 
some 
amplification. 
If 
an 
object 
has 
ceased 
to 
exist 
just 
before 
a 
given 
instant,1 
it 
may 
still 
be 
an 
object 
of 
sense 
at 
that 
instant. 
We 
may 
suppose 
that, 
of 
all 
the 
present 
objects 
of 
sense 
which 
have 
already 
ceased 
to 
exist, 
there 
is 
one 
which 
ceased 
to 
exist 
longest 
ago; 
at 
any 
rate 
a 
certain 
stretch 
of 
time 
is 
defined 
from 
the 
present 
instant 
back 
through 
the 
various 
moments 
when 
present 
objects 
of 
sense 
ceased 
to 
exist. 
This 
stretch 
is 
the 
"specious 
present." 
It 
will 
be 
observed 
that 
this 
is 
a 
complicated 
notion, 
involving 
mathematical 
time 
as 
well 
as 
psychological 
presence. 
The 



purely 
psychological 
notion 
which 
underlies 
it 
is 
the 
notion 
of 
one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience. 


Sense-data 
belonging 
to 
one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience 
are 
said 
to 
be 
present 
in 
that 
experience. 
This 
is 
a 
merely 
verbal 
definition. 


The 
above 
definitions 
still 
involve 
a 
certain 
difficulty, 
though 
perhaps 
not 
an 
insuperable 
one. 
We 
have 
admitted 
provisionally 
that 
a 
given 
particular 
may 
exist 
at 
different 
times. 
If 
it 
should 
happen 
that 
the 
whole 
group 
of 
particulars 
constituting 
one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience 
should 
recur, 
all 
our 
definitions 
of 
"the 
present 
time" 
and 
allied 
notions 
would 
become 
ambiguous. 
It 
is 
no 
answer 
to 
say 
that 
such 
recurrence 
is 
improbable: 
"the 
present 
time" 
is 
plainly 
not 
ambiguous, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
so 
if 
such 
recurrence 
took 
place. 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
the 
difficulty, 
one 
of 
two 
things 
is 
necessary. 
Either 
we 
must 
show 
that 
such 
complete 
recurrence 
is 
impossible, 
not 
merely 
improbable; 
or 
we 
must 
admit 
absolute 
time, 
i.e., 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
an 
entity 
called 
a 
"moment" 
(or 
a 
"period 
of 
time" 
possibly) 
which 
is 
not 
a 
mere 
relation 
between 
events, 
and 
is 
involved 
in 
assigning 
the 
temporal 
position 
of 
an 
object. 
The 
problem 
thus 
raised 
is 
serious; 
but 
it 
belongs 
rather 
to 
the 
physical 
than 
to 
the 
psychological 
analysis 
of 
time. 
Within 
our 
experience, 
complete 
recurrence 
does 
not 
occur. 
So 
long, 
therefore, 
as 
we 
are 
considering 
merely 
the 
psychological 
genesis 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
time, 
objections 
derived 
from 
the 
possibility 
of 
recurrence 
may 
be 
temporarily 
put 
aside. 
We 
shall 
return 
to 
this 
question 
at 
a 
later 
stage 
of 
this 
article. 


3. 
Simultaneity. 
This 
is 
a 
relation 
belonging 
to 
"physical" 
time, 
i.e., 
it 
is 
a 
relation 
between 
objects 
primarily, 
rather 
than 
between 
object 
and 
subject. 
By 
inference, 
we 
may 
conclude 
that 
sense-data 
are 
simultaneous 
with 
their 
subjects, 
i.e., 
that 
when 
an 
object 
is 
present 
to 
a 
subject, 
it 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
it. 
But 
the 
relation 
of 
simultaneity 
which 
is 
here 
intended 
is 
one 
which 
is 
primarily 
given 
in 
experience 
only 
as 
holding 
among 
objects. 
It 
does 
not 
mean 
simply 
"both 
present 
together." 
There 
are 
two 
reasons 
against 
such 
a 
definition. 
First, 
we 
wish 
to 
be 
able 
to 
speak 
of 
two 
entities 
as 
simultaneous 
when 
they 
are 
not 
both 
parts 
of 
one 
experience, 
i.e., 
when 
one 
or 
both 
are 
only 
known 
by 
description; 
thus 
we 
must 
have 
a 
meaning 
of 
simultaneity 
which 
does 
not 
introduce 
a 
subject. 
Secondly, 
in 
all 
cases 
where 
there 
is 
a 
change 
within 
what 
is 
present 
in 
one 
experience, 
there 
will 
be 
succession, 
and 

therefore 
absence 
of 
simultaneity, 
between 
two 
objects 
which 
are 
both 
present. 
When 
two 
objects 
form 
part 
of 
one 
present, 
they 
may 
be 
simultaneous, 
and 
their 
simultaneity 
may 
be 
immediately 
experienced. 
It 
is 
however 
by 
no 
means 
necessary 
that 
they 
should 
be 
simultaneous 
in 
this 
case, 
nor 
that, 
if 
they 
are 
in 
fact 
simultaneous, 
they 
should 
form 
part 
of 
what 
is 
present 
in 
one 
experience. 
The 
only 
point 
of 
connection, 
so 
far 
as 
knowledge 
is 
concerned, 
between 
simultaneity 
and 
presence, 
is 
that 
simultaneity 
can 
only 
be 
experienced 
between 
objects 
which 
are 
both 
present 
in 
one 
experience. 


4. 
The 
definition 
of 
"now." 
We 
saw 
that 
both 
"I" 
and 
"now" 
are 
to 
be 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
"this," 
where 
"this" 
is 
the 
object 
of 
attention. 
In 
order 
to 
define 
"now," 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
"this" 
should 
be 
a 
sense-datum. 
Then 
"now" 
means 
"simultaneous 
with 
this." 
Since 
the 
sense 
datum 
may 
lie 
anywhere 
within 
the 
specious 
present, 
"now" 
is 
to 
that 
extent 
ambiguous; 
to 
avoid 
this 
ambiguity, 
we 
may 
define 
"now" 
as 
meaning 
"simultaneous 
with 
some 
part 
of 
the 
specious 
present." 
This 
definition 
avoids 
ambiguity, 
but 
loses 
the 
essential 
simplicity 
which 
makes 
"now" 
important. 
When 
nothing 
is 
said 
to 
be 
contrary, 
we 
shall 
adopt 
the 
first 
definition; 
thus 
"now" 
will 
mean 
"simultaneous 
with 
this," 
where 
"this" 
is 
a 
sense-datum. 
5. 
The 
present 
time 
is 
the 
time 
of 
entities 
which 
are 
present, 
i.e., 
of 
all 
entities 
simultaneous 
with 
some 
part 
of 
the 
specious 
present, 
i.e., 
of 
all 
entities 
which 
are 
"now" 
in 
our 
second, 
unambiguous 
sense. 
If 
we 
adopt 
a 
relational 
theory 
of 
time, 
we 
may 
define 
a 
time 
simply 
as 
the 
class 
of 
all 
entities 
which 
are 
commonly 
said 
to 
be 
at 
that 
time, 
i.e., 
of 
all 
entities 
simultaneous 
with 
a 
given 
entity, 
or 
with 
a 
given 
set 
of 
entities 
if 
we 
do 
not 
wish 
to 
define 
a 
mathematical 
instant. 
Thus 
with 
a 
relational 
theory 
of 
time, 
"the 
present 
time" 
will 
be 
simply 
all 
entities 
simultaneous 
with 
some 
part 
of 
the 
specious 
present. 
With 
an 
absolute 
theory 
of 
time, 
"the 
present 
time" 
will 
be 
the 
time 
occupied 
by 
the 
specious 
present. 
We 
shall 
not 
at 
present 
attempt 
to 
decide 
between 
the 
absolute 
and 
relative 
theories 
of 
time. 
This 
completes 
our 
theory 
of 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
present. 
Although 
knowledge 
of 
succession 
is 
possible 
without 
passing 
outside 
the 
present, 
because 
the 
present 
is 
a 
finite 
interval 
of 
time 
within 
which 
changes 
can 
occur, 
yet 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past 
is 
not 
thus 
obtainable. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
we 



have 
to 
consider 
a 
new 
relation 
to 
objects, 
namely 
memory. 
The 
analysis 
of 
memory 
is 
a 
difficult 
problem, 
to 
which 
we 
must 
now 
turn 
our 
attention. 


6. 
Immediate 
memory. 
Without, 
as 
yet, 
asserting 
that 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
immediate 
memory, 
we 
may 
define 
it 
as 
"a 
two-term 
relation 
of 
subject 
and 
object, 
involving 
acquaintance, 
and 
such 
as 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
the 
knowledge 
that 
the 
object 
is 
in 
the 
past." 
This 
is 
not 
intended 
as 
a 
satisfactory 
definition, 
but 
merely 
as 
a 
means 
of 
pointing 
out 
what 
is 
to 
be 
discussed. 
It 
is 
indubitable 
that 
we 
have 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past, 
and 
it 
would 
seem, 
though 
this 
is 
not 
logically 
demonstrable, 
that 
such 
knowledge 
arises 
from 
acquaintance 
with 
past 
objects 
in 
a 
way 
enabling 
us 
to 
know 
that 
they 
are 
past. 
The 
existence, 
extent, 
and 
nature 
of 
such 
immediate 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past 
is 
now 
to 
be 
investigated. 
There 
are 
two 
questions 
to 
be 
considered, 
here 
as 
in 
theory 
of 
knowledge 
generally. 
First, 
there 
is 
the 
question: 
What 
sort 
of 
data 
would 
be 
logically 
capable 
of 
giving 
rise 
to 
the 
knowledge 
we 
possess? 
And 
secondly, 
there 
is 
the 
question: 
How 
far 
does 
introspection 
or 
other 
observation 
decide 
which 
of 
the 
logically 
possible 
systems 
of 
data 
is 
actually 
realized? 
We 
will 
deal 
with 
the 
first 
question 
first. 


We 
certainly 
know 
what 
we 
mean 
by 
saying 
"such-and-such 
an 
event 
occurred 
in 
the 
past." 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
that 
we 
know 
this 
analytically, 
because 
that 
will 
only 
be 
the 
case 
with 
those 
(if 
any) 
who 
have 
an 
adequate 
philosophy 
of 
time; 
I 
mean 
only 
that 
we 
know 
it 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
the 
phrase 
expresses 
a 
thought 
recognizably 
different 
from 
other 
thoughts. 
Thus 
we 
must 
understand 
complexes 
into 
which 
"past," 
or 
whatever 
is 
the 
essential 
constituent 
of 
"past," 
enters 
as 
a 
constituent. 
Again 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
"past" 
expresses 
a 
relation 
to 
"present," 
i.e., 
a 
thing 
is 
"past" 
when 
it 
has 
a 
certain 
relation 
to 
the 
present, 
or 
to 
a 
constituent 
of 
the 
present. 
At 
first 
sight, 
we 
should 
naturally 
say 
that 
what 
is 
past 
cannot 
also 
be 
present; 
but 
this 
would 
be 
to 
assume 
that 
no 
particular 
can 
exist 
at 
two 
different 
times, 
or 
endure 
throughout 
a 
finite 
period 
of 
time. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
make 
such 
an 
assumption, 
and 
therefore 
we 
shall 
not 
say 
that 
what 
is 
past 
cannot 
also 
be 
present. 
If 
there 
is 
a 
sense 
in 
which 
this 
is 
true, 
it 
will 
emerge 
later, 
but 
ought 
not 
to 
be 
part 
of 
what 
is 
originally 
taken 
as 
obvious. 


The 
question 
now 
arises 
whether 
"past" 
can 
be 
defined 
by 
relation 
to 
some 



one 
constituent 
of 
the 
present, 
or 
whether 
it 
involves 
the 
whole 
present 
experience. 
This 
question 
is 
bound 
up 
with 
another 
question, 
namely, 
can 
"past" 
be 
defined 
as 
"earlier 
than 
the 
present"? 
We 
have 
seen 
that 
succession 
may 
occur 
within 
the 
present; 
and 
when 
A 
is 
succeeded 
by 
B, 
we 
say 
that 
A 
is 
earlier 
than 
B. 
Thus 
"earlier" 
can 
be 
understood 
without 
passing 
outside 
the 
present. 
We 
cannot 
say, 
however, 
that 
the 
past 
is 
whatever 
is 
earlier 
than 
this 
or 
that 
constituent 
of 
the 
present, 
because 
the 
present 
has 
no 
sharp 
boundaries, 
and 
no 
constituent 
of 
it 
can 
be 
picked 
out 
as 
certainly 
the 
earliest. 
Thus 
if 
we 
choose 
any 
one 
constituent 
of 
the 
present, 
there 
may 
be 
earlier 
entities 
which 
are 
present 
and 
not 
past. 
If, 
therefore, 
"past" 
is 
to 
be 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
"earlier," 
it 
must 
be 
defined 
as 
"earlier 
than 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present." 
This 
definition 
would 
not 
be 
open 
to 
any 
logical 
objection, 
but 
I 
think 
it 
cannot 
represent 
the 
epistemological 
analysis 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past, 
since 
it 
is 
quite 
obvious 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
know 
that 
a 
given 
entity 
is 
in 
the 
past, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
review 
the 
whole 
present 
and 
find 
that 
it 
is 
all 
later 
than 
the 
given 
entity. 
This 
argument 
seems 
to 
show 
that 
the 
past 
must 
be 
definable 
without 
explicit 
reference 
to 
the 
whole 
present, 
and 
must 
therefore 
not 
be 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
"earlier." 


Another 
question, 
by 
no 
means 
easy 
to 
answer, 
is 
this: 
Does 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past 
involve 
acquaintance 
with 
past 
objects, 
or 
can 
it 
be 
accounted 
for 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
only 
knowledge 
by 
description 
is 
involved 
in 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past? 
That 
is, 
must 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past 
be 
derived 
from 
such 
propositions 
as 
"This 
is 
past," 
where 
this 
is 
an 
object 
of 
present 
acquaintance, 
or 
can 
it 
be 
wholly 
derived 
from 
propositions 
of 
the 
form: 
"An 
entity 
with 
such-and-such 
characteristics 
existed 
in 
the 
past"? 
The 
latter 
view 
might 
be 
maintained, 
for 
example, 
by 
introducing 
images: 
it 
might 
be 
said 
that 
we 
have 
images 
which 
we 
know 
to 
be 
more 
or 
less 
like 
objects 
of 
past 
experience, 
but 
that 
the 
simplest 
knowledge 
we 
have 
concerning 
such 
objects 
is 
their 
resemblance 
to 
images. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
simplest 
cognition 
upon 
which 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past 
is 
built 
will 
be 
perception 
of 
the 
fact 
"thisresembles-
something-in-the-past," 
where 
this 
is 
an 
image, 
and 
"something" 
is 
an 
"apparent 
variable." 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
such 
a 
view 
is 
tenable. 
No 
doubt, 
in 
cases 
of 
remembering 
something 
not 
very 
recent, 
we 
have 
often 
only 
acquaintance 
with 
an 
image, 
combined 
with 
the 
judgment 
that 
something 
like 
the 
image 
occurred 
in 
the 
past. 
But 
such 
memory 
is 
liable 
to 
error, 
and 
therefore 
does 
not 
involve 
perception 
of 
a 
fact 
of 
which 
"past" 
is 
a 



constituent. 
Since, 
however, 
the 
word 
"past" 
has 
significance 
for 
us, 
there 
must 
be 
perception 
of 
facts 
in 
which 
it 
occurs, 
and 
in 
such 
cases 
memory 
must 
be 
not 
liable 
to 
error. 
I 
conclude 
that, 
though 
other 
complications 
are 
logically 
possible, 
there 
must, 
in 
some 
cases, 
be 
immediate 
acquaintance 
with 
past 
objects 
given 
in 
a 
way 
which 
enables 
us 
to 
know 
that 
they 
are 
past, 
though 
such 
acquaintance 
may 
be 
confined 
to 
the 
very 
recent 
past. 


Coming 
now 
to 
what 
psychology 
has 
to 
say 
as 
to 
the 
empirical 
facts, 
we 
find 
three 
phenomena 
which 
it 
is 
important 
to 
distinguish. 
There 
is 
first 
what 
may 
be 
called 
"physiological" 
memory, 
which 
is 
simply 
the 
persistence 
of 
a 
sensation 
for 
a 
short 
time 
after 
the 
stimulus 
is 
re 
moved. 
The 
time 
during 
which 
we 
see 
a 
flash 
of 
lightning 
is 
longer 
than 
the 
time 
during 
which 
the 
flash 
of 
lightning, 
as 
a 
physical 
object, 
exists. 
This 
fact 
is 
irrelevant 
to 
us, 
since 
it 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
anything 
discoverable 
by 
introspection 
alone. 
Throughout 
the 
period 
of 
"physiological 
memory," 
the 
sense-datum 
is 
actually 
present; 
it 
is 
only 
the 
inferred 
physical 
object 
which 
has 
ceased. 


Secondly, 
there 
is 
our 
awareness 
of 
the 
immediate 
past, 
the 
short 
period 
during 
which 
the 
warmth 
of 
sensation 
gradually 
dies 
out 
of 
receding 
objects, 
as 
if 
we 
saw 
them 
under 
a 
fading 
light. 
The 
sound 
we 
heard 
a 
few 
seconds 
ago, 
but 
are 
not 
hearing 
now, 
may 
still 
be 
an 
object 
of 
acquaintance, 
but 
is 
given 
in 
a 
different 
way 
from 
that 
in 
which 
it 
was 
given 
when 
it 
was 
a 
sense-
datum. 
James2 
seems 
to 
include 
what 
is 
thus 
still 
given 
in 
the 
"specious 
present," 
but 
however 
we 
may 
choose 
to 
define 
the 
"specious 
present," 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
the 
object 
thus 
given, 
but 
not 
given 
in 
sense, 
is 
given 
in 
the 
way 
which 
makes 
us 
call 
it 
past; 
and 
James3 
rightly 
states 
that 
it 
is 
this 
experience 
which 
is 
"the 
original 
of 
our 
experience 
of 
pastness, 
from 
whence 
we 
get 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
term." 


Thirdly, 
there 
is 
our 
knowledge 
concerning 
more 
remote 
portions 
of 
the 
past. 
Such 
knowledge 
is 
more 
difficult 
to 
analyze, 
and 
is 
no 
doubt 
derivative 
and 
complicated, 
as 
well 
as 
liable 
to 
error. 
It 
does 
not, 
therefore, 
belong 
to 
the 
elementary 
constituents 
of 
our 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
world, 
which 
are 
what 
concern 
us 
at 
present. 
Or, 
if 
it 
does 
contain 
some 
elementary 
constituent, 
it 
must 
be 
one 
which 
is 
not 
essential 
to 
our 
having 
a 
knowledge 
of 
time, 
though 
it 
may 
increase 
the 
extent 
of 
our 
knowledge 
concerning 
past 
events. 



Thus 
of 
the 
three 
phenomena 
which 
we 
have 
been 
considering, 
only 
the 
second 
seems 
directly 
relevant 
to 
our 
present 
problem. 
We 
will 
give 
the 
name 
"immediate 
memory" 
to 
the 
relation 
which 
we 
have 
to 
an 
object 
which 
has 
recently 
been 
a 
sense-datum, 
but 
is 
now 
felt 
as 
past, 
though 
still 
given 
in 
acquaintance. 
It 
is 
essential 
that 
the 
object 
of 
immediate 
memory 
should 
be, 
at 
least 
in 
part, 
identical 
with 
the 
object 
previously 
given 
in 
sense, 
since 
otherwise 
immediate 
memory 
would 
not 
give 
acquaintance 
with 
what 
is 
past, 
and 
would 
not 
serve 
to 
account 
for 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
past. 
Hence, 
by 
our 
usual 
criterion, 
since 
immediate 
memory 
is 
intrinsically 
distinguishable 
from 
sensation, 
it 
follows 
that 
it 
is 
a 
different 
relation 
between 
subject 
and 
object. 
We 
shall 
take 
it 
as 
a 
primitive 
constituent 
of 
experience. 
We 
may 
define 
one 
entity 
as 
"past" 
with 
respect 
to 
another 
when 
it 
has 
to 
the 
other 
that 
relation 
which 
is 
experienced, 
in 
the 
consciousness 
of 
immediate 
memory, 
as 
existing 
between 
object 
and 
subject. 
This 
relation, 
of 
course, 
will 
come 
to 
be 
known 
to 
hold 
in 
a 
vast 
number 
of 
cases 
in 
which 
it 
is 
not 
experienced; 
the 
epistemological 
need 
of 
the 
immediate 
experience 
is 
to 
make 
us 
know 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
"past," 
and 
to 
give 
us 
data 
upon 
which 
our 
subsequent 
knowledge 
can 
be 
built. 
It 
will 
be 
observed 
that 
in 
order 
to 
know 
a 
past 
object 
we 
only 
need 
immediate 
memory, 
but 
in 
order 
to 
know 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
"past," 
an 
immediate 
remembering 
must 
be 
itself 
made 
an 
object 
of 
experience. 
Thus 
introspection 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
meaning 
of 
"past," 
because 
the 
only 
cases 
in 
which 
this 
relation 
is 
immediately 
given 
are 
cases 
in 
which 
one 
term 
is 
the 
subject. 
Thus 
"past," 
like 
"present," 
is 
a 
notion 
derived 
from 
psychology, 
whereas 
"earlier" 
and 
"later" 
can 
be 
known 
by 
an 
experience 
of 
non-mental 
objects. 


The 
extent 
of 
immediate 
memory, 
important 
as 
it 
is 
for 
other 
problems, 
need 
not 
now 
concern 
us; 
nor 
is 
it 
necessary 
to 
discuss 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
memory 
of 
objects 
with 
which 
we 
are 
no 
longer 
acquainted. 
The 
bare 
materials 
for 
the 
knowledge 
that 
there 
is 
a 
time-series 
can, 
I 
think, 
be 
provided 
without 
considering 
any 
form 
of 
memory 
beyond 
immediate 
memory. 


7. 
Succession 
is 
a 
relation 
which 
is 
given 
between 
objects, 
and 
belongs 
to 
physical 
time, 
where 
it 
plays 
a 
part 
analogous 
to 
that 
played 
by 
memory 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
mental 
time. 
Succession 
may 
be 
immediately 
experienced 
between 
parts 
of 
one 
sense-datum, 
for 
example 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
swift 
movement; 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
two 
objects 
of 
which 
one 
is 
succeeded 
by 
the 

other 
are 
both 
parts 
of 
the 
present. 
It 
would 
seem 
that 
succession 
may 
also 
be 
immediately 
experienced 
between 
an 
object 
of 
immediate 
memory 
and 
a 
sense-datum, 
or 
between 
two 
objects 
of 
immediate 
memory. 
The 
extensions 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
succession 
by 
inference 
need 
not 
now 
concern 
us. 


8. 
We 
say 
that 
A 
is 
earlier 
than 
B 
if 
A 
is 
succeeded 
by 
B; 
and 
in 
the 
same 
case 
we 
say 
B 
is 
later 
than 
A. 
These 
are 
purely 
verbal 
definitions. 
It 
should 
be 
observed 
that 
earlier 
and 
later 
are 
relations 
given 
as 
between 
objects, 
and 
not 
in 
any 
way 
implying 
past 
and 
present. 
There 
is 
no 
logical 
reason 
why 
the 
relations 
of 
earlier 
and 
later 
should 
not 
subsist 
in 
a 
world 
wholly 
devoid 
of 
consciousness. 
9. 
An 
event 
is 
said 
to 
be 
past 
when 
it 
is 
earlier 
than 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present, 
and 
is 
said 
to 
be 
future 
when 
it 
is 
later 
than 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
include 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present, 
since 
an 
event 
may 
be 
earlier 
than 
part 
of 
the 
present 
and 
yet 
be 
itself 
present, 
in 
cases 
where 
there 
is 
succession 
within 
the 
present. 
It 
is 
also 
necessary 
to 
define 
the 
past 
by 
means 
of 
earlier 
rather 
than 
by 
means 
of 
memory, 
since 
there 
may 
be 
things 
in 
the 
past 
which 
are 
neither 
themselves 
remembered 
nor 
simultaneous 
with 
anything 
remembered. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
there 
is 
no 
experience 
of 
the 
future. 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
that 
no 
particulars 
which 
are 
future 
are 
or 
have 
been 
experienced, 
because 
if 
a 
particular 
recurs 
or 
endures 
it 
may 
be 
experienced 
at 
the 
earlier 
time. 
What 
I 
mean 
is 
that 
there 
is 
no 
experience 
of 
anything 
as 
future, 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
sensation 
experiences 
a 
thing 
as 
present 
and 
memory 
experiences 
it 
as 
past. 
Thus 
the 
future 
is 
only 
known 
by 
inference, 
and 
is 
only 
known 
descriptively, 
as 
"what 
succeeds 
the 
present." 
Having 
now 
ended 
our 
definitions, 
we 
must 
proceed 
to 
the 
propositions 
constructing 
and 
connecting 
the 
physical 
and 
mental 
time-series. 


a. 
Simultaneity 
and 
succession 
both 
give 
rise 
to 
transitive 
relations, 
while 
simultaneity 
is 
symmetrical, 
and 
succession 
asymmetrical, 
or 
at 
least 
gives 
rise 
to 
an 
asymmetrical 
relation 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
it. 
This 
proposition 
is 
required 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
physical 
time-series. 
At 
first 
sight, 
it 
might 
seem 
to 
raise 
no 
difficulties, 
but 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
it 
raises 
great 
difficulties, 
if 
we 
admit 
the 
possibility 
of 
recurrence. 
These 
difficulties 
are 
so 
great 
that 
they 
seem 
to 
make 
either 
the 
denial 
of 
recurrence 



of 
particulars 
or 
the 
admission 
of 
absolute 
time 
almost 
unavoidable. 


Let 
us 
begin 
with 
simultaneity. 
Suppose 
that 
I 
see 
a 
given 
object 
A 
continuously 
while 
I 
am 
hearing 
two 
successive 
sounds 
B 
and 
C. 
Then 
B 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
A 
and 
A 
with 
C, 
but 
B 
is 
not 
simultaneous 
with 
C. 
Thus 
it 
would 
seem 
to 
follow 
that 
simultaneity, 
in 
the 
sense 
in 
which 
we 
have 
been 
using 
the 
word, 
is 
not 
transitive. 
We 
might 
escape 
this 
conclusion 
by 
denying 
that 
any 
numerically 
identical 
particular 
ever 
exists 
at 
two 
different 
instants: 
thus 
instead 
of 
the 
one 
A, 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
series 
of 
A's, 
not 
differing 
as 
to 
predicates, 
one 
for 
each 
instant 
during 
which 
we 
had 
thought 
that 
A 
endures. 
Such 
a 
view 
would 
not 
be 
logically 
untenable, 
but 
it 
seems 
incredible, 
and 
almost 
any 
other 
tenable 
theory 
would 
seem 
preferable. 


In 
the 
same 
way 
as 
we 
defined 
one 
(momentary) 
total 
experience, 
we 
may, 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
avoid 
absolute 
time, 
define 
an 
"instant" 
as 
a 
group 
of 
events 
any 
two 
of 
which 
are 
simultaneous 
with 
each 
other, 
and 
not 
all 
of 
which 
are 
simultaneous 
with 
anything 
outside 
the 
group. 
Then 
an 
event 
is 
"at" 
an 
instant 
when 
it 
is 
a 
member 
of 
the 
class 
which 
is 
that 
instant. 
When 
a 
number 
of 
events 
are 
all 
at 
the 
same 
instant, 
they 
are 
related 
in 
the 
way 
which 
we 
have 
in 
mind 
when 
we 
think 
that 
simultaneity 
is 
transitive. 
It 
must 
be 
observed 
that 
we 
do 
not 
thus 
obtain 
a 
transitive 
two-term 
relation 
unless 
the 
instant 
is 
specified: 
"A 
and 
B 
are 
at 
the 
instant 
t" 
is 
transitive, 
but 
"there 
is 
an 
instant 
at 
which 
A 
and 
B 
are" 
holds 
whenever 
A 
and 
B 
are 
simultaneous, 
and 
is 
thus 
not 
transitive. 
In 
spite 
of 
this, 
however, 
the 
above 
definition 
of 
an 
"instant" 
provides 
formally 
what 
is 
required, 
so 
far 
as 
simultaneity 
is 
concerned. 
It 
is 
only 
so 
far 
as 
succession 
is 
concerned 
that 
this 
definition 
will 
be 
found 
inadequate. 


Succession, 
if 
the 
time-series 
is 
to 
be 
constituted, 
must 
give 
rise 
to 
an 
asymmetrical 
transitive 
relation. 
Now 
if 
recurrence 
or 
persistence 
is 
possible, 
succession 
itself 
will 
have 
neither 
of 
these 
properties. 
If 
A 
occurs 
before 
B, 
and 
again 
after 
B, 
we 
have 
a 
case 
where 
succession 
is 
not 
asymmetrical. 
If 
B 
occurs 
both 
before 
A 
and 
after 
C, 
while 
A 
occurs 
before 
C 
but 
never 
occurs 
after 
C, 
A 
will 
succeed 
B 
and 
B 
will 
succeed 
C, 
but 
A 
will 
not 
succeed 
C; 
thus 
succession 
will 
not 
be 
transitive. 
Let 
us 
consider 
how 
this 
is 
affected 
if 
we 
pass 
on 
to 
"instants" 
in 
the 
sense 
above 
defined. 
We 
may 
say 
that 
one 
instant 
is 
posterior 
to 
another, 
and 
the 
other 
anterior 
to 
the 
one, 
if 
every 



member 
of 
the 
one 
succeeds 
every 
member 
of 
the 
other. 
But 
now 
we 
are 
faced 
with 
the 
possibility 
of 
repetition, 
i.e., 
of 
an 
instant 
being 
posterior 
to 
itself. 
If 
everything 
in 
the 
universe 
at 
one 
instant 
were 
to 
occur 
again 
after 
a 
certain 
interval, 
so 
as 
again 
to 
constitute 
an 
instant, 
the 
anterior 
and 
posterior 
instants 
would 
be 
identical 
according 
to 
our 
present 
definition. 
This 
result 
cannot 
be 
avoided 
by 
altering 
the 
definition 
of 
anterior 
and 
posterior. 
It 
can 
only 
be 
avoided 
by 
finding 
some 
set 
of 
entities 
of 
which 
we 
know 
that 
they 
cannot 
recur. 
If 
we 
took 
Bergson's 
view, 
according 
to 
which 
our 
mental 
life 
at 
each 
moment 
is 
intrinsically 
different, 
owing 
to 
memory, 
from 
that 
of 
a 
moment 
preceded 
by 
different 
experiences, 
then 
the 
experience 
of 
each 
moment 
of 
life 
is 
unique, 
and 
can 
be 
used 
to 
define 
an 
instant. 
In 
this 
way, 
if 
the 
whole 
universe 
may 
be 
taken 
as 
one 
experience, 
the 
time-series 
can 
be 
constructed 
by 
means 
of 
memory. 
There 
is 
no 
logical 
error 
in 
such 
a 
procedure, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
greater 
accumulation 
of 
questionable 
metaphysics 
than 
is 
suitable 
for 
our 
purposes. 
We 
must, 
therefore, 
seek 
for 
some 
other 
way 
of 
constructing 
the 
time-series. 


It 
is 
no 
answer 
to 
our 
difficulty 
to 
reply 
that 
the 
complete 
recurrence 
of 
the 
whole 
momentary 
state 
of 
the 
universe 
is 
improbable. 
The 
point 
of 
our 
difficulty 
is 
this: 
If 
the 
whole 
state 
of 
the 
universe 
did 
recur, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
there 
would 
be 
something 
not 
numerically 
identical 
in 
the 
two 
occurrences, 
something, 
in 
fact, 
which 
leads 
us 
to 
speak 
of 
"two 
occurrences." 
It 
would 
be 
contrary 
to 
what 
is 
self-evident 
to 
say 
that 
there 
was 
strictly 
one 
occurrence, 
which 
was 
anterior 
and 
posterior 
to 
itself. 
Without 
taking 
account 
of 
the 
whole 
universe, 
if 
a 
thing 
A 
exists 
at 
one 
time, 
then 
ceases, 
and 
then 
exists 
again 
at 
a 
later 
time, 
it 
seems 
obvious 
that 
there 
is 
some 
numerical 
diversity 
involved, 
even 
if 
A 
is 
numerically 
the 
same. 
In 
this 
case, 
in 
fact, 
where 
A 
reappears 
after 
an 
absence, 
it 
would 
seem 
strained 
to 
say 
that 
the 
same 
particular 
had 
reappeared: 
we 
should 
more 
naturally 
say 
that 
a 
new 
precisely 
similar 
particular 
had 
appeared. 
This 
is 
by 
no 
means 
so 
obvious 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
thing 
which 
persists 
unchanged 
throughout 
a 
continuous 
period. 
Before 
going 
further, 
we 
must 
consider 
whether 
there 
can 
be 
any 
substantial 
difference 
between 
persistence 
and 
recurrence. 


The 
view 
which 
I 
wish 
to 
advocate 
is 
the 
following. 
An 
entity 
may 
persist 
unchanged 
throughout 
a 
continuous 
portion 
of 
time, 
without 
any 
numerical 
diversity 
corresponding 
to 
the 
different 
instants 
during 
which 
it 
exists; 
but 
if 



an 
entity 
ceases 
to 
exist, 
any 
entity 
existing 
at 
a 
subsequent 
time 
must 
be 
numerically 
diverse 
from 
the 
one 
that 
has 
ceased. 
The 
object 
of 
this 
hypothesis 
is 
to 
preserve, 
if 
possible, 
a 
relational 
theory 
of 
time; 
therefore 
the 
first 
thing 
to 
be 
done 
is 
to 
re-state 
it 
in 
terms 
which 
do 
not 
even 
verbally 
imply 
absolute 
time. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
we 
may 
adopt 
the 
following 
definitions. 
We 
shall 
say 
that 
a 
thing 
exists 
at 
several 
times 
if 
it 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
things 
which 
are 
not 
simultaneous 
with 
each 
other. 
We 
shall 
say 
that 
it 
exists 
throughout 
a 
continuous 
time 
when, 
if 
it 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
two 
things 
which 
are 
not 
simultaneous 
with 
each 
other, 
it 
is 
also 
simultaneous 
with 
any 
thing 
which 
comes 
after 
the 
earlier 
and 
before 
the 
later 
of 
the 
two 
things. 
The 
assumption 
that 
two 
things 
which 
are 
separated 
by 
an 
interval 
of 
time 
cannot 
be 
numerically 
identical 
is 
presupposed 
in 
the 
above 
definition. 
This 
assumption, 
in 
relational 
language, 
may 
be 
stated 
as 
follows: 
A 
precedes 
B 
and 
is 
not 
simultaneous 
with 
it, 
while 
B 
precedes 
C 
and 
is 
not 
simultaneous 
with 
it, 
then 
A 
and 
C 
are 
numerically 
diverse4 
We 
have 
to 
inquire 
whether 
a 
logically 
tenable 
theory 
of 
the 
time-
series 
can 
be 
constructed 
on 
this 
basis. 


The 
difficulty 
of 
possible 
recurrence 
of 
the 
whole 
state 
of 
the 
universe, 
which 
troubled 
us 
before, 
is 
now 
obviated. 
It 
is 
now 
possible 
to 
define 
an 
instant 
as 
a 
class 
of 
entities 
of 
which 
any 
two 
are 
simultaneous 
with 
each 
other 
and 
not 
all 
are 
simultaneous 
with 
any 
entity 
outside 
the 
class. 
It 
will 
follow 
that 
it 
is 
meaningless 
to 
suppose 
the 
universe 
to 
persist 
unchanged 
throughout 
a 
finite 
time. 
This 
is 
perhaps 
an 
objection; 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
may 
be 
said 
that, 
when 
we 
suppose 
that 
such 
persistence 
is 
possible, 
we 
are 
imagining 
ourselves 
as 
spectators 
watching 
the 
unusual 
immobility 
with 
continually 
increasing 
astonishment; 
and 
in 
this 
case, 
our 
feelings, 
at 
least, 
are 
in 
a 
state 
of 
change. 
Let 
us, 
then, 
suppose 
that 
it 
is 
logically 
impossible, 
as 
our 
present 
theory 
requires, 
for 
the 
universe 
to 
persist 
unchanged 
throughout 
a 
finite 
time. 
Then 
if 
two 
times 
are 
different, 
something 
must 
have 
changed 
meanwhile; 
and 
if 
this 
something 
has 
changed 
back 
so 
far 
as 
its 
character 
goes, 
yet 
what 
has 
reappeared 
is, 
in 
virtue 
of 
our 
assumption, 
numerically 
different 
from 
what 
has 
disappeared. 
Thus 
it 
is 
impossible 
that 
the 
world 
should 
be 
composed 
of 
numerically 
the 
same 
particulars 
at 
two 
different 
times. 


We 
may 
now 
define 
an 
instant 
as 
a 
class 
which 
is 
identical 
with 
all 
the 
terms 



that 
are 
simultaneous 
with 
every 
member 
of 
itself. 
We 
will 
say 
that 
one 
event 
"wholly 
precedes" 
another 
when 
it 
precedes 
it 
without 
being 
simultaneous 
with 
it; 
and 
we 
will 
say 
that 
one 
instant 
is 
"anterior" 
to 
another 
when 
there 
is 
at 
least 
one 
member 
of 
the 
one 
instant 
which 
wholly 
precedes 
at 
least 
one 
member 
of 
the 
other 
instant. 
We 
shall 
assume 
that 
simultaneity 
is 
symmetrical, 
and 
that 
every 
event 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
itself, 
so 
that 
nothing 
can 
wholly 
precede 
itself. 
We 
will 
also 
assume 
that 
"wholly 
preceding" 
is 
transitive. 
These 
two 
assumptions 
together 
imply 
our 
previous 
assumption, 
which 
was 
that 
"wholly 
preceding" 
is 
asymmetrical, 
i.e., 
that 
if 
A 
wholly 
precedes 
B, 
then 
B 
does 
not 
wholly 
precede 
A. 
Finally, 
we 
will 
assume 
that 
of 
any 
two 
events 
which 
are 
not 
simultaneous 
one 
must 
wholly 
precede 
the 
other. 
Then 
we 
can 
prove 
that 
"anterior" 
is 
a 
serial 
relation, 
so 
that 
the 
instants 
of 
time 
form 
a 
series. 
The 
only 
remaining 
thing 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
proved 
is 
that 
there 
are 
instants, 
and 
that 
every 
event 
belongs 
to 
some 
instant. 
For 
this 
purpose 
let 
us 
call 
one 
event 
an 
"early 
part" 
of 
another 
when 
everything 
simultaneous 
with 
the 
one 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
the 
other, 
and 
nothing 
wholly 
preceding 
the 
one 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
the 
other. 
Let 
us 
define 
the 
"beginning" 
of 
an 
event 
as 
the 
class 
of 
events 
simultaneous 
with 
all 
its 
early 
parts. 
Then 
it 
will 
be 
found 
that, 
if 
we 
assume 
that 
any 
event 
wholly 
after 
something 
simultaneous 
with 
a 
given 
event 
is 
wholly 
after 
some 
early 
part 
of 
the 
given 
event, 
then 
the 
beginning 
of 
an 
event 
is 
an 
instant 
of 
which 
the 
event 
in 
question 
is 
a 
member.5 


It 
would 
seem, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
physical 
time-series 
can 
be 
constructed 
by 
means 
of 
the 
relations 
considered 
in 
the 
earlier 
part 
of 
this 
article. 
Our 
few 
remaining 
propositions, 
which 
are 
chiefly 
concerned 
with 
mental 
time, 
offer 
less 
difficulty. 


b. 
What 
is 
remembered 
is 
past. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
past 
was 
defined 
as 
"what 
is 
earlier 
than 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
present," 
so 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
supposed 
that 
whatever 
is 
passed 
is 
remembered, 
nor 
does 
memory 
enter 
into 
the 
definition 
of 
the 
past. 
c. 
When 
a 
change 
is 
immediately 
experienced 
in 
sensation, 
parts 
of 
the 
present 
are 
earlier 
than 
other 
parts. 
This 
follows, 
because, 
since 
the 
change, 
by 
hypothesis, 
lies 
within 
sensation, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
earlier 
and 
the 
later 
state 
of 
things 
are 
both 
present 
according 
to 
the 
definition. 

d. 
If 
A, 
B, 
and 
C 
succeed 
each 
other 
rapidly, 
A 
and 
B 
may 
be 
parts 
of 
one 
sensation, 
and 
likewise 
B 
and 
C, 
while 
A 
and 
C 
are 
not 
parts 
of 
one 
sensation, 
but 
A 
is 
remembered 
when 
C 
is 
present 
in 
sensation. 
In 
such 
a 
case, 
A 
and 
B 
belong 
to 
the 
same 
present, 
and 
likewise 
B 
and 
C, 
but 
not 
A 
and 
C; 
thus 
the 
relation 
"belonging 
to 
the 
same 
present" 
is 
not 
transitive. 
This 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
question 
of 
persistence 
or 
recurrence 
which 
we 
considered 
under 
(a), 
but 
is 
an 
independent 
fact 
concerned 
with 
mental 
time, 
and 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
present 
is 
not 
an 
instant. 
It 
follows 
that, 
apart 
from 
any 
question 
of 
duration 
in 
objects, 
two 
presents 
may 
overlap 
without 
coinciding. 
1. 
The 
word 
"instant" 
has 
a 
meaning 
defined 
later 
in 
the 
present 
article.

4. 
Another 
form 
of 
the 
same 
axiom 
is: 
If 
A 
both 
precedes 
and 
succeeds 
B, 
then 
A 
is 
simultaneous 
with 
B.
