================================================================================

ECONOMICS AND FINANCE

1. The Altman Z-score provides a reasonably accurate (90% historically) indicator of a company's likelihood of bankruptcy within two years.

2. Exchange-value is perception-based while use-value is reality-based, allowing the two to diverge without limit.

3. The divergence between exchange-value and use-value tends to inflate the assets of the wealthy and deflate those of the poor, exacerbating pre-existing inequalities.

4. College educations often have high exchange-value but zero or negative use-value, as they frequently fail to make people smarter or more competent.

5. Commodities associated with the wealthy class experience inflated exchange-values relative to use-values, while those associated with the poor experience deflated exchange-values.

11. The state can take wealth but cannot generate it; wealth generation requires free enterprise.

18. Classical liberals (free-marketeers) regard individualism/egoism as the driving force of a healthy economy, not a vice.

19. The free market is free for entrepreneurs with capital but forbidding and unfree for workers, who experience drudgery and sameness.

27. Microsoft's competitive advantage lies in product bundling and cross-functionality, not innovation.

28. Microsoft counters its lack of innovativeness by buying patents and acquiring innovative companies.

48. Technology-caused job shortages will eventually necessitate some form of universal welfare.

50. Minimum wage laws harm the workers they purport to help by pricing low-skilled workers out of the labor market.

================================================================================

DRUG POLICY

6. All drugs should be legalized unconditionally, primarily for economic rather than civil libertarian reasons.

7. The War on Drugs protects drug cartels and creates economic parasites in the form of lawyers, probation officers, and prison guards.

8. Drug laws cause non-criminals to be absorbed into the criminal underworld by forcing them to transact with criminals.

9. When drugs were legal in the 19th century United States, drug use was considerably lower than after the War on Drugs began.

================================================================================

POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY

10. Neither Kant nor Ross would regard coercive wealth redistribution as ethically permissible, as it violates autonomy.

12. Hobbes believed language must be carefully regulated because deception and obfuscation threaten the social contract.

13. For Hobbes, contracts are null and void without government enforcement, making governments necessary for mutual trust.

14. According to Rousseau, people are best off when nobody has too much more than anybody else; inequality breeds cruelty.

15. Rousseau argues that civil society causes much of the mutual antagonism it claims to prevent by enabling inequality.

16. Nietzsche viewed forgetting as active repression rather than mere passive inertia.

17. Marx sought an entirely new kind of society attainable only through revolution, not a return to older forms.

46. Freedom of speech should be protected broadly but has legitimate limits when speech directly incites violence or harm.

================================================================================

UNIVERSITIES AND EDUCATION

20. Universities celebrate diversity while the actual working world cares only about what workers can produce.

21. Knowledge Management cannot assist universities because university expenses are inherently opaque and resist scrutiny.

22. Universities are inherently averse to internal auditing because they are supposed to be places for "exploring ideas."

23. Universities can be financially inefficient with impunity due to government grants, subsidies, and prestige-driven tuition.

43. Standardized tests should remain part of college admissions because they provide objective measures that reduce bias.

================================================================================

AMERICAN POLITICS AND HISTORY

24. The Founding Fathers would likely approve of Trump's immigration stance as a defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

25. The US entered WWI primarily because Wilson needed to save political face, not for the stated reasons of making the world safe for democracy.

26. The Treaty of Versailles was excessively punitive toward Germany and violated the terms proposed during armistice negotiations.

31. American party politics stabilized into a two-party system almost immediately after the nation's founding and has remained structurally similar ever since.

32. For psychological reasons, people need political parties but cannot sustain more than two major ones.

33. Trump came into politics from outside the system and disrupted Republican orthodoxies more than Democratic ones.

================================================================================

FRAUD AND ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR

29. The fraud triangle (opportunity, pressure, rationalization) explains why individuals commit fraud.

30. Nepotism hiring and inadequate background checks create fraud opportunities in organizations.

================================================================================

PSYCHOLOGY

34. Prejudice functions as psychological resistance to information that threatens one's worldview.

35. Freud's concept of sublimation explains why some individuals channel primitive drives into socially productive activities while others do not.

36. The Peter Pan Syndrome represents a failure to sublimate, resulting in adults who cannot defer gratification or accept responsibility.

37. Attachment theory explains how early childhood experiences with caregivers shape adult relationship patterns and mental health.

38. Psychopathy exists on a spectrum; individuals can be non-psychopathic in specific professional contexts while being highly psychopathic in others.

39. Breaching experiments operate on psychological fault lines; they are ineffective where no such fault lines exist.

40. Modern women are forced to suppress traditionally feminine aspects of themselves just as past women were forced to suppress masculine aspects.

================================================================================

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

41. China's Belt and Road Initiative represents multiple forms of soft power simultaneously: positive, deliberate negative, and inadvertent negative.

42. The Soviet Union collapsed due to a combination of economic inefficiency, political rigidity, and nationalist pressures.

44. Carbon taxes are inferior to standing environmental regulations because they create price uncertainty without guaranteeing environmental outcomes.

45. Colonialism differs from imperialism in that colonialism involves settlement and direct control while imperialism involves indirect control and exploitation.

================================================================================

PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND IDEAS

47. The Turing Test is not a good test of intelligence because it measures conversational mimicry rather than genuine understanding.

49. Ideas function as networks rather than discrete units, with new ideas emerging from novel connections between existing ones.
