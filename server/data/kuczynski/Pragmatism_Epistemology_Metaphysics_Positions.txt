Here are the positions advocated in this work:

---

## **Positions Extracted from *Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Metaphysics***

### **I. Central Thesis**

1. **Each of James's five core pragmatist theses (i)-(v) is false.** However, they are "distorted ways of expressing a number of legitimate insights concerning knowledge and the acquisition thereof."

2. **Pragmatism conflates epistemology with metaphysics/ontology.** What pragmatists incorrectly represent as claims about truth itself are actually claims about our knowledge of truth.

### **II. Critique of Specific Pragmatist Theses**

#### **On (i): "The meaning of a hypothesis lies in its observable consequences"**

3. **The meaning of a hypothesis is NOT identical to its observable consequences.** The relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is always contingent, never analytic.

4. **Observable consequences depend on operative conditions and causal mechanisms.** Different conditions or mechanisms would yield different observational consequences from the same hypothesis.

5. **One can accept a hypothesis H while denying any particular specification of its observable consequences O^ without contradiction.** This proves H is not equivalent to O^.

6. **What (i) distortedly expresses is the truism (i+): "Our knowledge of the veracity of a given hypothesis is based on its observable consequences."** This is true but utterly truistic.

7. **Observable consequences are the "vector sum" of what a hypothesis says AND the subject's relationship to the alleged reality.** They are not purely a function of the hypothesis itself.

#### **On (ii): "A true idea is one that allows us to control the world"**

8. **It is not truth that is empowering; it is knowledge.** Truths are useless unless known.

9. **The property of being power-enhancing belongs to our knowledge of truths, not to those truths per se.**

10. **What (ii) distortedly expresses is (ii+): "Instances of knowledge are ipso facto empowering."** The pragmatist incorrectly attributes to truth what is actually a property of knowledge.

#### **On (iii): "True ideas are those we can assimilate"**

11. **There are highly assimilable false ideas and highly non-assimilable true ones.** (iii) is at best a half-truth.

12. **The pragmatist version (iii*), that truth IS assimilability, is an "outright falsehood."**

13. **What (iii) distortedly expresses is (iii+): "Knowledge is assimilated truth, and beliefs become increasingly knowledge-constitutive as they become increasingly grounded."**

#### **On (iv): "Truth happens to an idea"**

14. **(iv) is false taken literally.** An idea is either true or false; it does not become true.

15. **What (iv) distortedly expresses is (iv+): "The property of being true doesn't have any value until an idea that has that property becomes a piece of knowledge."** The value of trueness eventuates when truth is acquired/known.

#### **On (v): "Truth is made, not discovered"**

16. **(v) is "clearly false."** Truth is discovered, not made.

17. **What (v) distortedly expresses is (v+): "Knowledge is made, not discovered."** We construct knowledge (through operations on data), even though we discover truth.

18. **(v+) is "eminently defensible."**

### **III. The Pragmatist Error Pattern**

19. **Pragmatism systematically confuses properties of truth with properties of knowledge.** Each pragmatist thesis takes something true of knowledge and falsely attributes it to truth itself.

20. **Pragmatism replaces an object-oriented conception of knowledge with a subject-oriented (agent-oriented) conception.** This is what (i)-(v) have in common.

21. **Pragmatism combats an "intellectualist" conception of knowledge and replaces it with an "interactionist" or "operationalist" conception.**

### **IV. Critique of "Classical Epistemology" (CE)**

22. **The negations of (i)-(v) are each correct.** But they *suggest* (without implying) that knowledge-acquisition is purely passive reception.

23. **Classical Epistemology (CE)—that knowledge-acquisition is about passively taking in what exists—may be true in some narrow technical sense, but it is misleading.**

24. **Intellectual discoveries are made by solving practical problems.** Insights are the "collateral damage" of workarounds to practical roadblocks.

### **V. The Practical Origins of Theoretical Knowledge**

25. **Much of physics is fallout from attempts to create better weapons, dams, etc.** Mathematics is constructed to validate this fallout.

26. **Economics was invented to manage the influx of wealth from the New World into Europe.**

27. **Anthropology was invented to help Europeans interact more productively with colonized peoples.**

28. **Psychoanalysis was developed to solve otherwise unsolvable psychiatric problems.**

29. **Even "purely philosophical" problems are not purely philosophical.** Modern epistemology arose in the mid-1600s precisely when modern physics and engineering arose, and when Church doctrines were losing credibility because they interfered with scientific progress.

30. **Cartesian skepticism and Lockean empiricism arose because faith-based epistemology was no longer viable.**

31. **Modern logic began with Boole in the mid-1800s, with the objective of automating reasoning, precisely when physical production was being automated.** This is not coincidental.

### **VI. The Nature of "Purely Theoretical" Knowledge**

32. **"Purely theoretical" problems are problems relating to the mutual coherence of discoveries made in the course of solving practical problems.**

33. **Calculus was invented to compute planetary orbits and ballistics.** "Purely theoretical" questions (infinitesimals, fractals) arose to validate an enormously useful belief-system.

34. **"Purely theoretical" knowledge, insofar as it exists, tends to be stale and one-dimensional.**

35. **"Book knowledge" of principles proves useless in practice.** One learns formalisms based on principles, not the principles themselves, until forced to relearn them through practical application.

36. **"Pure theory" tends to concern itself with mere schemata.** Consequently, "theoretical knowledge" degenerates when not anchored in practical knowledge.

### **VII. The Truth-Utility Relationship**

37. **Ideas are NOT true because they are useful (contra James).** The theorems of trigonometry are useful because they are true, not the other way around.

38. **However, truths are learned—and are worth learning—because they are useful.** It is not absurd to identify the true *insofar as it is worth learning* with the useful.

39. **Theoretical knowledge should exist only as long as it is anchored in practical knowledge.** When it ceases to be so anchored, it degenerates into knowledge of empty formalisms.

40. **Truth is objective.** Either there is an even number of stars in the galaxy or there isn't, regardless of whether this is worth knowing.

41. **Knowledge is a relationship between subject and object (mind and world), and therefore has a subjective side.**

### **VIII. The Biological Function of Intellect**

42. **The intellect exists biologically to help the organism survive and procreate.**

43. **In human beings, intellect has to some extent become autonomous.** Pure mathematicians study relations "for their own sake."

44. **Even autonomous intellectual pursuits investigate coherence-relations internal to datasets that are themselves of interest only because of practical applications.**

### **IX. The Theoretician-Practitioner Relationship**

45. **The pure mathematician/philosopher studies coherence-relations within practically-originated datasets.**

46. **The theoretician is to the practitioner what the martial artist is to the soldier.** The theoretician exercises the ability to do what the practitioner is already doing.

47. **It is the practitioner who determines both what the theoretician studies and the general lines along which he studies it.**

### **X. Art and Theory**

48. **The artist, like the engineer, organizes matter (paint, marble, sound).** But the artist is interested in material relations "for their own sake" rather than for practical applications.

49. **The artist is interested either in deepening understanding of material relations or in exercising his ability to understand them.**

50. **The artist appears to have turned his back on reality only because he is exercising his ability to engage it.** The same holds of the theoretician.

51. **Interest in truth or beauty "for their own sake," though not directly concerned with practical results, is directly concerned with the cognitive basis of our ability to generate practical results.**

52. **James's thesis that truth is utility, though false, may be regarded as a distorted expression of the truth that theoretical activity is indirectly practical.**
