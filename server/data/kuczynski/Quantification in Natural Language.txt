## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Thesis:**
   - The text defends five specific contentions about the literal meanings of quantifiers and numerals in natural language, challenging orthodox views held by many contemporary logicians and philosophers.

2. **Complex Formulation:**
   - The thesis can be articulated as follows: "The literal meanings of quantifiers and numerals in natural language do not align with the traditional views held by many logicians and philosophers; instead, they involve presuppositions and exactness that are often overlooked."

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: "Some phi is a psi" is not an existence-claim.**
   - Explanation: The text argues that the sentence "Some phi is a psi" does not assert the existence of phi but presupposes it. This is supported by comparing it to a sentence that explicitly states existence, showing that the two have different meanings.

2. **Argument 2: "Some phi is a psi" merely presupposes the existence of phi.**
   - Explanation: The text asserts that the sentence "Some phi is a psi" presupposes the existence of phi but does not assert it. This is contrasted with a sentence that explicitly states the existence of phi, highlighting the difference in semantic content.

3. **Argument 3: "All phi's are psi's" is incompatible with "Some phi's are psi's."**
   - Explanation: The text argues that the sentence "All phi's are psi's" logically entails the negation of "Some phi's are psi's," and thus the two sentences are incompatible. This challenges the common view that "all" and "some" can be used interchangeably in certain contexts.

4. **Argument 4: "Five elephants can dance" means exactly five elephants can dance.**
   - Explanation: The text contends that the sentence "Five elephants can dance" is literally false if six elephants can dance, emphasizing that numerals in natural language denote exact quantities rather than minimums.

5. **Argument 5: "Ten elephants can dance" is incompatible with "Five elephants can dance."**
   - Explanation: As an immediate consequence of Argument 4, the text argues that sentences with different numerals are incompatible if the numerals differ, reinforcing the notion that numerals denote exact quantities.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Secondary Argument: The distinction between sentences and propositions is crucial.**
   - Explanation: The text emphasizes that the logical properties of propositions may not align with those of the sentences that express them, which is a foundational claim supporting the primary arguments.

2. **Subsidiary Claim: The semantic rule for definite descriptions involves presuppositions.**
   - Explanation: The text references Strawson's view on definite descriptions to illustrate how presuppositions play a role in semantics, which supports the primary arguments about presuppositions in quantifiers.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Semantic analysis should focus on literal meanings rather than pragmatic implications.**
   - Explanation: The text assumes that the primary focus of semantic analysis should be on what is literally meant by sentences, rather than what is conveyed through implicature or other pragmatic means.

2. **Assumption 2: The logical properties of sentences and propositions can differ.**
   - Explanation: The text assumes that the logical properties of propositions may not always align with those of the sentences that express them, which is crucial for understanding the arguments about quantifiers and numerals.

3. **Assumption 3: The traditional views of logicians and philosophers on quantifiers are flawed.**
   - Explanation: The text assumes that the orthodox views held by many logicians and philosophers regarding quantifiers and numerals are incorrect, which is the basis for challenging these views.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Structure:**
   - The text presents a series of interconnected arguments that collectively challenge traditional views on quantifiers and numerals. Each argument builds on the previous one, culminating in a comprehensive critique of orthodox positions.

2. **Logical Dependencies:**
   - The arguments are logically dependent on each other. For example, Argument 4 (about numerals denoting exact quantities) directly supports Argument 5 (about the incompatibility of sentences with different numerals).

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Progression:**
   - The text begins by outlining the five contentions it aims to defend, then proceeds to argue for each contention in turn. It starts with a detailed analysis of the first contention, using examples to illustrate the difference between explicit statements and presuppositions.

2. **Development:**
   - The arguments develop from a focus on the semantics of quantifiers to the semantics of numerals, showing how the principles applied to quantifiers also apply to numerals. The text uses examples and logical analysis to build its case, culminating in a comprehensive challenge to traditional views.

## SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIVE QUOTATIONS

10. **Quote 10:**
    - "According to (a version of) a view first put forth by Strawson and now held by many mainstream semanticists, the semantic rule for 'that phi has psi' is given by the following rule: (STR) If, in the context of utterance, O is uniquely a salient phi, then an utterance U in that context of 'that phi is psi' has for its literal meaning a proposition P that is true exactly if O has psi."
    - **Location/Context:** This quote appears in the section discussing the distinction between sentences and propositions.
    - **Significance:** This quote references Strawson's view on definite descriptions, illustrating how presuppositions play a role in semantics, which supports the text's arguments about quantifiers.

## SECTION 4: ANALYTICAL MOVES DEPLOYED

### 4.1 Conceptual Analysis and Distinctions Drawn

1. **Conceptual Analysis:**
   - The text engages in detailed conceptual analysis of quantifiers and numerals, examining their literal meanings and how they differ from pragmatic implications.
   - **Example:** The text analyzes the difference between "some" and "all" quantifiers, arguing that "all phi's are psi's" is incompatible with "some phi's are psi's."

2. **Distinctions Drawn:**
   - The text draws a crucial distinction between what a sentence says and what it presupposes, which is central to its arguments about quantifiers.
   - **Example:** The text distinguishes between the sentence "Some phi is a psi" (which presupposes the existence of phi) and "There exists at least one phi and, moreover, at least one phi is also a psi" (which explicitly states the existence of phi).

### 4.2 Argumentation Strategies

1. **Reductio ad Absurdum:**
   - The text uses reductio ad absurdum to challenge traditional views on quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** The text argues that if "some" were an existence-claim, then "Some phi is a psi" would be equivalent to "There exists at least one phi and, moreover, at least one phi is also a psi," which leads to absurd consequences given the text's examples.

2. **Modus Tollens:**
   - The text employs modus tollens to argue against the traditional views on quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** If the traditional view that "some" is an existence-claim were true, then "Some phi is a psi" would entail the existence of phi. However, the text argues that this is not the case, thus rejecting the traditional view.

### 4.3 Category Error Detection

1. **Category Error Detection:**
   - The text identifies category errors in the traditional views on quantifiers and numerals, particularly in how they conflate what a sentence says with what it presupposes.
   - **Example:** The text argues that treating "some" as an existence-claim is a category error because it conflates the presupposition of existence with an explicit statement of existence.

### 4.4 Counterfactual Reasoning

1. **Counterfactual Reasoning:**
   - The text uses counterfactual reasoning to illustrate the implications of its arguments.
   - **Example:** The text argues that if six elephants can dance, then the sentence "Five elephants can dance" is false, not merely misleading, which is a counterfactual scenario used to support the contention about the exactness of numerals.

### 4.5 Thought Experiments

1. **Thought Experiments:**
   - The text employs thought experiments to illustrate the differences between sentences and their meanings.
   - **Example:** The text uses the example of diamonds on a table to illustrate the difference between a sentence that explicitly states existence and one that presupposes it, serving as a thought experiment to support its arguments.

### 4.6 Analogies and Comparisons

1. **Analogies and Comparisons:**
   - The text uses analogies and comparisons to clarify its points about quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** The text compares the sentence "Five elephants can dance" to "1 + 1 = 3" to emphasize that the former is literally false if six elephants can dance, just as the latter is literally false.

### 4.7 Appeals to Intuition

1. **Appeals to Intuition:**
   - The text appeals to the reader's intuition to support its arguments about the semantics of quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** The text asks whether the sentences "There is at least one diamond on the table, and at least one such diamond is extremely valuable" and "Some of the diamonds on the table are extremely valuable" have the same meaning, appealing to the reader's intuition that they do not.

### 4.8 Inference to Best Explanation

1. **Inference to Best Explanation:**
   - The text uses inference to the best explanation to argue for its contentions about quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** The text argues that the best explanation for the difference in meaning between "Some phi is a psi" and "There exists at least one phi and, moreover, at least one phi is also a psi" is that the former presupposes the existence of phi while the latter explicitly states it.

### 4.9 Transcendental Arguments

1. **Transcendental Arguments:**
   - The text employs transcendental arguments to establish the necessary conditions for the meanings of quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** The text argues that the literal meaning of "Five elephants can dance" must be that exactly five elephants can dance, as this is the only way to explain why the sentence is false if six elephants can dance.

### 4.10 Dialectical Moves

1. **Dialectical Moves:**
   - The text engages in dialectical moves to challenge and refute traditional views on quantifiers and numerals.
   - **Example:** The text presents the traditional views held by logicians and philosophers, then systematically argues against each view, using examples and logical analysis to support its contentions.

### 4.11 Deconstructive Strategies

1. **Deconstructive Strategies:**
   - The text uses deconstructive strategies to challenge the traditional views on quantifiers and numerals by breaking down their assumptions and showing their flaws.
   - **Example:** The text deconstructs the assumption that "some" is an existence-claim by showing that it presupposes rather than asserts existence, thus challenging the traditional view.

### 4.12 Hermeneutical Approaches

1. **Hermeneutical Approaches:**

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the distinction between presupposition and assertion is crucial for understanding the appropriateness of utterances in specific contexts. This thesis is articulated through the following formulations:

1. **Primary Formulation**: "Contrary to what is generally held, [utterance 2], unlike [utterance 1], is not an existence-claim."

2. **Secondary Formulation**: "The truth-conditions of my utterance-not of the proposition I'm affirming by means of it, but of my utterance per se-are given by [&&]. The truth-conditions my utterance are fulfilled exactly if && is true. But the truth-conditions of the proposition I've affirmed by means of that utterance are fulfilled exactly if & is true."

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Utterance Appropriateness and Presupposition**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the appropriateness of an utterance depends on whether it presupposes or asserts the existence of the subject in question. For example, if asked about the existence of diamonds on the table, an utterance that presupposes their existence (utterance 2) is inappropriate, while one that asserts their existence (utterance 1) is appropriate.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides examples such as "are any diamonds on the table" and "do any felines exist?" to illustrate this point.

2. **Argument 2: Truth-Conditions of Utterances vs. Propositions**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that the truth-conditions of an utterance differ from those of the proposition it affirms. An utterance's truth-conditions include contextual elements that the proposition's truth-conditions do not.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses the example of pointing at a person and saying "that guy is an economist" to show that the utterance's truth-conditions involve the existence of a uniquely salient individual, while the proposition's truth-conditions only involve the person being an economist.

3. **Argument 3: Inferential Liaisons**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the inferential liaisons of an utterance are different from those of the corresponding proposition due to the difference in their truth-conditions.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text explains that the proposition "Smith is an economist" (&) does not entail, nor is entailed by, the utterance's truth-conditions "there is a uniquely salient individual, and any such individual is an economist" (&&).

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Overresponding and Underresponding**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that responding to a question about the existence of felines with "Yes. There exists at least one feline; moreover, at least one feline is ferocious" (A) is overresponding, while responding with "some felines are ferocious" (B) is underresponding.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text argues that A is on point without requiring ad hoc corrections by the auditor, while B requires such corrections to be on point.

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Semantic Difference Between A and B**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that A and B are semantically different because A asserts the existence of felines, while B presupposes it.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses the example of pointing at a man and saying "that person is a menace to society" (MS) versus "there exists a uniquely contextually salient individual x; moreover, x is a menace to society" (TE) to illustrate this difference.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Contextual Salience**: The text assumes that the context in which an utterance is made can determine the salience of certain individuals or objects, which affects the truth-conditions of the utterance.

2. **Assumption 2: Distinction Between Utterance and Proposition**: The text assumes that there is a clear distinction between the truth-conditions of an utterance and those of the proposition it affirms, and that this distinction is relevant to understanding the appropriateness of utterances.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that equivalent sentences can have non-equivalent propositions as their meanings, particularly when context sensitivity and presupposition are involved. This is exemplified by the distinction between sentences like "that person is a menace to society" (MS) and "there exists a uniquely contextually salient individual x; moreover, x is a menace to society" (TE).

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Distinction Between Sentences and Propositions**:
   - The text argues that while sentences 1 and 2 are equivalent in the sense that they cannot differ in truth value, the propositions they express can differ. This is because the proposition expressed by a sentence can depend on context and presuppositions.
   - Example: "1 and 2 are indeed equivalent... But 1 and 2 are sentences. Sometimes equivalent sentences have non-equivalent propositions for their meanings."

2. **Context Sensitivity and Presupposition**:
   - The text posits that sentences like MS presuppose the existence of a uniquely contextually salient individual, whereas TE asserts it. This difference in presupposition affects the propositions they express.
   - Example: "In uttering MS, on the other hand, I am presupposing, not asserting, that there exists a uniquely contextually salient person x."

3. **Semantic Rules and Truth Conditions**:
   - The text uses semantic rules (MSR and TER) to show how the propositions expressed by MS and TE differ, even though the sentences are equivalent in truth conditions.
   - Example: "The semantic rule for MS is this: (MSR) If, in a given context C, there is a uniquely contextually salient individual x, then the proposition meant by an utterance in C of 'that person is a menace to society' is identical (or equivalent) with: x is a menace to society."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Relevance to Specific Questions**:
   - The text argues that the appropriateness of a response to a question depends on whether the sentence used answers the question directly or presupposes an answer to it.
   - Example: "As we saw, A is, whereas B is not, an appropriate response to the question 'do any felines exist?' And the reason, as we said, is that, whereas A is itself an answer to that question, B assumes a certain answer to it."

2. **Implications for Existence Claims**:
   - The text suggests that the distinction between sentences and propositions has implications for understanding existence claims, as seen in the discussion of sentences 1 and 2.
   - Example: "'There must be an error in your reasoning', it will be said: '1 is obviously an existence-claim. You admit this. You also admit that 1 and 2 are equivalent. Given those facts, it surely follows that the proposition affirmed by 2 is equivalent with one to the effect that there exists at least one apple on the table and, moreover, that at least one such apple is rotten.'"

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Contextual Salience**: The text assumes that the concept of contextual salience is crucial for understanding the meaning of certain sentences.

2. **Semantic Rules**: It assumes that semantic rules can accurately describe how sentences are interpreted in different contexts.

3. **Distinction Between Presupposition and Assertion**: The text assumes that the distinction between presupposing and asserting a fact is meaningful and affects the propositions expressed by sentences.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's argument follows a deductive structure, starting from the premise that equivalent sentences can have non-equivalent propositions, and then using specific examples (MS and TE) to illustrate this point. It employs semantic rules to show how context and presupposition affect the propositions expressed by sentences, and then applies this analysis to the broader question of existence claims.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction of Key Concepts**: The text begins by introducing the concepts of presupposition and context sensitivity, using examples like MS and TE to illustrate these concepts.

2. **Application to Specific Cases**: It then applies these concepts to specific cases, such as the felines example and the apples on the table example, to show how they affect the appropriateness of responses to questions.

3. **Semantic Rules and Truth Conditions**: The text then introduces semantic rules (MSR and TER) to formalize the analysis and show how these rules lead to different propositions being expressed by equivalent sentences.

4. **Implications for Existence Claims**: Finally, it discusses the implications of this analysis for understanding existence claims, using the example of sentences 1 and 2 to illustrate the point.

## SECTION 3: REPRESENTATIVE QUOTATIONS

1. **The Author's Main Position**:
   - Quote: "The core thesis of the text is that equivalent sentences can have non-equivalent propositions as their meanings, particularly when context sensitivity and presupposition are involved."
   - Location/Context: This is a summary of the main thesis, derived from the text's overall argument.
   - Significance: This quote encapsulates the central claim of the text, which is that the meaning of sentences can vary based on context and presupposition, even if the sentences are equivalent in truth conditions.

2. **Key Supporting Arguments**:
   - Quote: "In uttering MS, on the other hand, I am presupposing, not asserting, that there exists a uniquely contextually salient person x."
   - Location/Context: This appears in the discussion of the difference between MS and TE.
   - Significance: This quote supports the main thesis by illustrating how presupposition affects the meaning of a sentence, distinguishing it from a sentence that asserts the same fact.

3. **Crucial Definitions or Conceptual Distinctions**:
   - Quote: "1 and 2 are indeed equivalent... But 1 and 2 are sentences. Sometimes equivalent sentences have non-equivalent propositions for their meanings."
   - Location/Context: This is part of the argument about the distinction between sentences and propositions.
   - Significance: This quote defines the key distinction between sentences and propositions, which is central to the text's argument.

4. **Positions Being Criticized or Refuted**:
   - Quote: "'There must be an error in your reasoning', it will be said: '1 is obviously an existence-claim. You admit this. You also admit that 1 and 2 are equivalent. Given those facts, it surely follows that the proposition affirmed by 2 is equivalent with one to the effect that there exists at least one apple on the table and, moreover, that at least one such apple is rotten.'"
   - Location/Context: This is part of the anticipated objection to the text's argument.
   - Significance: This quote represents the position that the text is refuting, namely the view that equivalent sentences must express equivalent propositions.

5. **Methodological Statements**:
   - Quote: "The semantic rule for MS is this: (MSR) If, in a given context C, there is a uniquely contextually salient individual x, then the proposition meant by an utterance in C of 'that person is a menace to society' is identical (or equivalent) with: x is a menace to society."
   - Location/Context: This is part of the formalization of the semantic rules for MS.
   - Significance: This quote illustrates the text's methodological approach of using semantic rules to analyze the meaning of sentences in context.

6. **Pivotal Turns in the Argument**:
   - Quote: "Thus, supposing that, while pointing at Smith, I utter ME, the proposition I'm thereby affirming is true iff Smith is a menace to society."
   - Location/Context: This appears in the discussion of the proposition expressed by ME.
   - Significance: This quote marks a pivotal turn in the argument, as it shows how the proposition expressed by a sentence can be independent of the context in which it is uttered.

7. **Context Sensitivity and Presupposition**:
   - Quote: "The material relating to contextual salience in the semantic rule for ME does not itself make it into the proposition meant by a given utterance of that sentence; that material serves the purpose only of identifying the person whom such an utterance (when non-abortive) describes as being a menace to society."
   - Location/Context: This is part of the discussion of how context affects the meaning of ME.
   - Significance: This quote highlights the role of context in determining the meaning of a sentence, which is a key aspect of the text's argument.

8. **Equivalence and Truth Conditions**:
   - Quote: "So, even though the proposition literally meant, in a given set of circumstances, by a given token of ME is not equivalent with the proposition literally meant, in those very circumstances, by an utterance of TE, there is no possible set of circumstances in which an utterance of MS isn't true exactly iff an utterance of TE is true."
   - Location/Context: This is part of the discussion of the equivalence of MS and TE.
   - Significance: This quote clarifies the relationship between the propositions expressed by equivalent sentences, showing that they can differ in meaning while being equivalent in truth conditions.

9. **Implications for Existence Claims**:
   - Quote: "And once that is granted, it becomes very hard to see how 2 could fail to be an existence-claim. In fact, given that 1 and 2 are equivalent, it becomes unclear what it even means to say that 2 is not an existence-claim."
   - Location/Context: This is part of the discussion of the implications of the text's argument for existence claims.
   - Significance: This quote illustrates the challenge posed by the text's argument to traditional views of existence claims, showing how the distinction between sentences and propositions affects our understanding of such claims.

10. **Abortive Utterances**:
    - Quote: "A consequence of the reasonable presumption that MSR is the semantic rule for MS is that, if produced in circumstances in which there is no contextually salient individual x, an utterance of MS fails to have any proposition for its meaning and is therefore abortive (i.e. neither true nor false)."

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the semantic rule for statement 2 (''some of the diamonds on the table are extremely valuable'') should be modeled after the semantic rule for MSR (a rule concerning presuppositions about individuals) rather than TSE (a rule concerning truth conditions without presuppositions). This thesis is articulated through the following formulations:

1. **Primary Formulation**: The semantic rule for statement 2 should be modeled after MSR, not TSE, due to the contextual sensitivity and presuppositional nature of statement 2.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The truth conditions of statement 2 are not adequately captured by SR2# or SR2*, and a new semantic rule must be developed that accounts for the contextual and presuppositional aspects of the statement.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Contextual Sensitivity of Statement 2**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that statement 2's truth value is sensitive to the context in which it is uttered, particularly whether there are diamonds on the table. If there are no diamonds, the statement is out of place rather than false, which aligns with the behavior of statements governed by MSR.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text cites the example of uttering statement 2 in a context where it is in question whether there are any diamonds on the table, leading to the statement being out of place rather than false.

2. **Argument 2: Presuppositional Nature of Statement 2**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that statement 2 presupposes the existence of diamonds on the table, similar to how MSR presupposes the existence of a contextually salient individual. This presupposition affects the statement's truth value.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text compares the behavior of statement 2 to that of ME (a statement with a presupposition about a contextually salient man), noting that both are neither true nor false when their presuppositions are not met.

3. **Argument 3: Inadequacy of SR2# and SR2***
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that SR2# and SR2* fail to capture the semantic behavior of statement 2 because they do not account for the statement's presuppositional nature and contextual sensitivity.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text demonstrates that SR2# would incorrectly classify statement 2 as false in contexts where it should be out of place, and SR2* incorrectly ties the truth of the statement to specific diamonds rather than the existence of any valuable diamonds.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Secondary Argument 1: Critique of Fregean Orthodoxies**
   - **Explanation**: The text critiques Fregean orthodoxies, suggesting that the semantic rules proposed by Frege do not adequately account for the contextual and presuppositional aspects of language.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text mentions that many readers might be inclined to accept Fregean orthodoxies over the arguments presented for Points #1-#5, indicating a need to challenge these orthodoxies.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the Semantic Entailment (SE) principle, which states that a universally quantified statement (EP) entails a corresponding existentially quantified statement (SP), does not hold for ordinary English sentences. This is because the principle fails to account for the nuances of natural language, particularly the distinction between extensional and intensional interpretations of terms like "set."

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Distinction Between Extensional and Intensional Interpretations**
   - The text argues that the word "set" can be interpreted extensionally (as in formal logic) or intensionally (as in ordinary language). This distinction affects the validity of SE.
   - Example: The statement "x is a member of the smallest set containing Jerry's favorite number" can be read extensionally as "x = 2" or intensionally as "x is a number and Jerry likes x more than he likes any other number."

2. **Failure of SE in Ordinary Language**
   - The text provides examples where SE fails in ordinary language, such as the costume party scenario where "some" does not follow from "all."
   - Example: At a costume party where everyone wears a vampire costume, saying "some of the people at the party wore vampire costumes" is incorrect when "all" is the appropriate quantifier.

3. **Introduction of Sets* and Their Properties**
   - The text introduces the concept of "sets*" to account for the intensional use of "set" in ordinary language, which differs from the extensional "sets" used in formal logic.
   - Example: The "smallest set* containing Jerry's favorite number" varies across possible worlds and over time, unlike the corresponding extensional set.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Semantic Rule for Sets* (SR2)**
   - The text proposes a semantic rule (SR2) for sets*, which states that an utterance about some diamonds being valuable is true if all members of a non-empty set* of diamonds are valuable.
   - This rule is presented as a more accurate reflection of how ordinary language functions compared to the SE principle.

2. **Critique of the Orthodox View**
   - The text critiques the "orthodox view" in the philosophy of language, which it suggests is the widespread acceptance of SE without considering its limitations in ordinary language.
   - The critique is supported by the argument that SE fails to account for the intensional aspects of language use.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption of Contextual Sensitivity**: The text assumes that the meaning of statements in ordinary language is highly sensitive to context, which formal logic often fails to capture.

2. **Assumption of Non-Extensional Use**: The text assumes that ordinary language users often employ terms like "set" in a non-extensional manner, which affects the applicability of logical principles like SE.

3. **Assumption of Semantic Flexibility**: The text assumes that semantic rules must be flexible enough to accommodate the nuances of natural language, rather than adhering strictly to formal logical principles.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Introduction of Key Concepts**: The text begins by introducing the SE principle and its formal counterparts (EPF and SPF), setting the stage for the critique.

2. **Presentation of Extensional vs. Intensional Interpretations**: The text then presents the distinction between extensional and intensional interpretations of "set," using examples to illustrate the difference.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that the use of 'only' in sentences like 'Only some cupcakes are yummy' does not merely emphasize the literal meaning of 'some' but specifies that all and only the members of a proper subset of the set of all cupcakes are yummy. This challenges the notion that 'only' is semantically redundant and argues that it serves a crucial function in directing the listener to the literal meaning of the sentence.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Semantic Analysis of 'Only' and 'Some'**
   - The text argues that 'only some cupcakes are yummy' (a2) means that all and only the members of a proper subset of the set of all cupcakes are yummy. This is supported by the logical analysis of the sentence structure and the role of 'only' in specifying the scope of 'some'.

2. **Comparison with Other Quantifiers**
   - The text compares 'only some' with 'at most some' (a3) to show that both are virtually synonymous and that each sentence is grammatically and meaningfully distinct from 'some cupcakes are yummy' (a1). This comparison supports the argument that 'only' has a specific semantic function.

3. **Role of 'Only' in Directing Attention to Literal Meaning**
   - The text argues that 'only' directs the listener to take the word 'some' at face value, preventing them from drawing non-literal inferences. This is illustrated through the dialogue about the McDonald's, where 'only' is used to emphasize the literal meaning of the statement.

4. **Non-Redundancy of 'Only' in Pragmatics**
   - While 'only' may be semantically redundant, it is not redundant in pragmatics. The text argues that 'only' and similar terms like 'literally' and 'precisely' serve to constrain the listener's inferences, which is crucial in communication.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Intuitions as Evidence**
   - The text claims that denying the literal meaning of 'only some cupcakes are yummy' would be bad methodology because it contradicts our intuitions about language use. This supports the primary argument by appealing to the reliability of linguistic intuitions.

2. **Examples and Dialogues**
   - The text uses dialogues to illustrate how 'only', 'literally', and 'precisely' function in real communication. These examples serve as subsidiary claims that reinforce the primary arguments about the role of these terms in directing attention to literal meaning.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Semantic-Pragmatic Distinction**: The text assumes a clear distinction between semantics (the study of literal meaning) and pragmatics (the study of context-dependent meaning). This assumption underpins the argument that 'only' is semantically redundant but pragmatically significant.

2. **Reliability of Linguistic Intuitions**: The text assumes that linguistic intuitions are generally reliable and should be given weight in semantic analysis. This assumption supports the claim that denying the literal meaning of 'only some cupcakes are yummy' is methodologically flawed.

3. **Importance of Literal Meaning**: The text assumes that understanding the literal meaning of a sentence is crucial for effective communication. This assumption is central to the argument that 'only' directs listeners to the literal meaning of 'some'.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premises**: The text begins by presenting sentences (a1, a2, a2*, a3) and their meanings, establishing the premise that 'only some' and 'at most some' are virtually synonymous and distinct from 'some'.

2. **Inference**: From these premises, the text infers that 'only' in 'only some cupcakes are yummy' specifies that all and only the members of a proper subset of the set of all cupcakes are yummy.

3. **Support**: The text supports this inference with dialogues and examples that illustrate how 'only' and similar terms function in communication to direct attention to literal meaning.

4. **Conclusion**: The text concludes that 'only' is not semantically redundant but serves a crucial pragmatic function in constraining the listener's inferences.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction of Sentences**: The text begins by introducing and analyzing sentences (a1, a2, a2*, a3) to establish the semantic differences between 'some', 'only some', and 'at most some'.
