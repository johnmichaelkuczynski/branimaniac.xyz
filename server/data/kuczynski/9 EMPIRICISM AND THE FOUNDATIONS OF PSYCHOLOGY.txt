conservative assumption that Brown's mind, if stratified, is for that reason different from a sane person's mind? Indeed, why not stick with the even more conservative assumption that Brown's mind, like everyone else's, is non-stratified and that, when his condition is acting up, it is because purely physiological mechanisms are generating mental activity that they shouldn't be generating?" 
There are several points to make here. First, to have a delusion isn't to have a wrong belief; it is to have a belief that is right in the wrong way. More accurately, it is to have a belief that might be right but the vehicle for which is some infantile, and therefore false, belief. (Even more accurately, it isn't to have such a belief; it is to experience the conscious activity expressive of such a belief. Beliefs themselves, even delusive ones, don't consist of activity, but of activity-mediating structures. And so far as delusions give rise to hallucinations, those hallucinations are distinct from those delusions. Hallucinations, so far as they are rooted in delusions, or in beliefs of any other kind, are phenomenologicizations of beliefs; they are not themselves beliefs.) Brown believes that Mary is malicious. This belief is correct. One way to have this correct belief is to believe that Mary is a witch. But this is the wrong way to have that belief. In believing that Mary is a witch, Brown is having the right belief, but in the wrong 
way. 
But even when he is symptomatic, Brown also has that belief in the right way; he has it in the same antiseptic, discursive way that Smith has it. And when Brown

regress to a condition of cognitive infantilism. Such regressions make it possible for Brown to consciously believe what he really believes; and such regressions also enable him to have those beliefs in a form in which, if taken at face value, they are so brazenly wrong that they aren't a threat to anyone. Brown's mother isn't a witch. When Brown tells her that she is a witch, she can laugh it off; and Brown too can laugh it off, once he regains lucidity. If, when lucid, Brown were to tell his mother that she was petty, hypocritical, and undermining, she couldn't laugh it off, and neither could Brown. Brown's consciously having that belief, and making it known to those who whom it concerned, would disrupt and possibly destroy the network of beliefs and values that, when he is lucid, enable him to live with his mother: his consciously having that belief would thus make it internally impossible for him to continue to live with his mother. And his expressing it would make it externally impossible for him to do so: given that Brown's mother has the character-traits that make such a statement correct, she is likely to lack the character-traits would dispose her to take such a comment in stride, and she is likely to react to such a comment with volcanic hostility. 
If taken as attempts to assert already established facts, the statements just made beg the question. The objector says: "Brown's delusions have a strictly physiological, as opposed to a psychodynamic basis." The argument put forth presupposes that they do have a psychodynamic basis. (This doesn't mean that they don't have a physiological basis. It means that, so far as they do have such a basis, it is because the

need of explanation as not being in need of explanation. In fact, it is often the most opaque psychological truths that people regard as being the most transparent. 
Folk-psychology makes it possible for a given person to rationalize his conscious states to the extent that he isn't afflicted by psychopatholgy, and it does the same for him to the extent that he is thus affilicted but has erected defenses that condition any given symptomatic derivative of his condition on its appearing not to be such a derivative. (In this context, "folk-psychology" refers to the totality of platitudes about the psyche accepted by the laity. So I am not using that term in the same as Churchland, who uses it to refer to the position that anyone ever has propositional attitudes of any kind.) 
Because Brown is schizophrenic, his conscious ideation includes things whose existence folk-psychology altogether denies and it includes things whose existence, though not themselves denied by folk-psychology, make it impossible for him to reconcile his conscious states with one another without positing the existence of things whose existence folk-psychology denies. 
When attempting to reconcile his various conscious states, Brown has the option of taking the position that there is no position to be taken: "that's just how things are." This position is equivalent with the position that his conscious abnormalities have a strictly somatic basis. This is the position that Brown's psychiatrists are likely to urge him to take, and it is likely, partly for that reason, to be his "official" position - the

one that he tries to take and that he tells himself he's taken. But it isn't Brown's actual 
position. (Given only that Brown is psychotic, it follows that it ultimately is not Brown's position, even though it is left open how remote from consciousness, and how nonoperational, Brown's defenses have made it.) Brown's delusive beliefs, though false by definition, are in some cases (not all) very obviously transformations of non- delusive beliefs; and in some cases (not all) it is obvious to Brown, when he is lucid, that they are such transformations. Mary isn't literally a witch. When Brown is lucid (to the extent that he is ever lucid), Brown is aware of this fact. But when he's lucid, he is (so we may suppose, without running afoul of the clinical data) no less aware of the fact that Mary is an awful person. 
Given these two facts, Brown will inevitably regard his Mary-delusion as a transformation of a correct Mary-related belief of his – and he'll be right. As for the idea that this delusion "came out of nowhere," or was just the product of "crossed wires," Brown will rightly regard it as complete non-starter. A person can't have one such delusion without having That one delusion of Brown's is but one of many that Brown has. Some of those delusions can be explained, and Brown probably knows some of those explanations. (When correct, they are sometimes self-explanatory: if you see your abusive step-father as a ghoul an actual ghoul, not the metaphorical ghoul that he is you will not, when lucid, have much trouble deciphering that delusion.)

kill each other. The madman's mind is infantile. The infant's mind paints in black and white; the adult's, in pastels. For the most part, the infant's monochromatic intellectual pallete is a consequence of the fact that his mind hasn't matured. But up to a point, it's a consequence of the fact that, unlike the non-infant, he isn't an arch- rationalizer, who smothers obvious truths in disclamatory balderdash. Maturation involves the implementation of repressions, and regression therefore involves their removal. The SAP has two sets of propositional attitudes - those belonging to the part of him that hasn't undergone regression, and those belonging to the part of him that has. To outgrow a belief or desire isn't to cease to have it; it is for it to cease to be operational. (We will establish this in Chapter 14.) To that X doesn't want to have sex with his mother is not to say there is no such desire anywhere in X's mind; it is to say that, if there is such a desire, it isn't embedded in X's psychological architecture in such a way that there is any chance that X will act on it. For these reasons, there is a good chance that a given SAP's psychopathologies will sometimes express themselves in his consciousness in a relatively undisguised form. 
Let us put these points into a broader context. People aren't disorganized heaps of thought. (In this context, "thought" covers every kind of mentation.) People are organized, non-heaps of thought. (More precisely, they are the structures underlying such non-heaps.) A given person's thoughts are organized in two ways. They are organized vertically.

significant respect in which the just-stated argument must be qualified. If everyone is a SAP, then, it would seem to follow, everyone has had the sorts of pathology-related experiences that one must have to be a competent psychoanalyst. But not everyone has had such experiences. There are two reasons why the last statement (the one preceding this one) is compatible with the second to last statement. 
First, even though everyone is a SAP, most people's psychopathologies are sufficiently mild that their conscious derivatives are not recognizable as such derivatives; they blend in too well - or, given a modicum of rationalization, can be made to blend in too well - with non-pathological mentation. 
— 
Second, in cases where a person's condition is severe - more severe, indeed, than it has to be for him to have experiences of the relevant kind - that person is likely to have erected defenses against his own pathology that are so heavy-duty that no symptomatic expression of his condition can enter his consciousness except on the condition that it be distorted beyond all recognition. 
The first point is self-explanatory. The second is not, and it must be clarified. Where many a pathology is concerned - and the pathology may be either somatic or psychological - the afflicted party suffers more from his defenses against his condition than from the condition itself: sometimes the pathogen is less a source distress than one's response to the pathogen. People with allergies haver overactive immunesystems; their immune-systems over-react to pathogens that, in and of

psychopath is to a mentally healthy person what a person who never developed a skeleton to begin with is to a normal person. 
Thus, in saying, as we often will, that OCD is a “disfigurement of psychological structure," we are not saying anything incompatible with the contention that OCD is a system-internal ailment. A hair-line fracture is a disfigurement of an otherwise healthy skeleton; it is thus "internal" to a healthy skeletal structure and could be described as a "structure-internal" condition. Osteoperosis, on the other hand, is not system-internal. It involves a disintegration of one's skeleton as a whole, as opposed to a localized fissure in an otherwise intact skeleton, and it is therefore a systemic 
ailment. 
(B) (a) and (b) are perfectly compatible. One cannot be healthy if one does no exercise at all, and one cannot be healthy if one exercises 8 hours every day. Similarly, a competent psychoanalyst must himself have experienced some psychopathology, but he must also not be a psychological wreck. 
Everyone has witnessed the overt behavior of mentall unwell people. But that means nothing: everyone has witnessed the overt behavior of reptiles; but no one would say for that reason that anyone understands reptile psychology. And to the extent that witnessing the overt behavior of a mentally ill person does apprise a mentally healthy person of the nature of mental illness, it is because their condition differs but minutely from ours.

being damaged makes one incompetent; to the extent that a person is psychologically damaged, he isn't good at anything. To be sure, there are very damaged people who are exceptionally competent in some particular area; such a person might be a great composer or mathematician. But to the extent that a mentally ill person is a good composer, it's only because his psychopathologies haven't corrupted his compositional abilities. (I suspect that the experience of having been mentally ill has opened up artistic and intellectual vistas that would otherwise have remained closed. But this doesn't mean that being ill is in any way performance-enhancing.A person who has recovered from a debilitating illness knows much that he wouldn't otherwise know; but his illness, while he had it, didn't enhance his abilities.) 
There is another, less obvious reason why a competent psychoanalyst cannot be too mentally ill. One cannot possibly be mentally ill without being blind to one's some aspect or other of one's own psychological condition; and for the very reasons that one must know about one's own psychological condition to know about another person's, one is incapable of knowing about another person's psychological condition if one is blind to one's own. A neurotic is somebody who has blinded himself to his own desires and whose desires, therefore, must be discharged as symptoms, instead of as actions. Thus, it is inherent in what it is to be neurotic that one have blinded oneself oneself to one's own psychological condition. The essence of neurosis is defensiveness about facts about one's self that one doesn't want to know about; and a comcomitant of such

reaquires its lost dominance. But it doesnt do so cleanly: infantile thought has to compete with non-infantile thought, and mentation of the one kind infiltrates mentation of the other. Someone having a dream isn't for that reason psychotic. The reason: the regression to psychological infancy is too clean; infantile mentation isn't sufficiently commingled with more evolved forms of mentation. Infants aren't psychotic. The reason: infantile mentation isn't to any degree thus commingled. In the psychotic, such commingling has occurred. The fact that psychosis can lead to a loss of self-knowledge is to be understood in terms of this fact, along with three others, these being:

(1) Infantile thinking is wishful thinking (so far as one's thought is infantile, one sees things as one wants them to be, not as they are); 
(2) Infantile thinking is incompatible with non-infantile thinking (the infant sees his father as superhuman, whereas the adult sees his father as human); 
(3) The psychotic, being cognitively mature, has to take special measures to validate his wishful, psychotic thinking, and he must therefore repress those beliefs of his that express the non-infantile part of himself.

Q A 
What I am going to say borrows heavily from points that won't have been justified, even in outline form, until the end of the book. The statements made in this paragraph are both speculative and dogmatic. 
Psychopaths cannot be internally conflicted. To be internally is to have two incompatible values; psychopaths don't have values and therefore don't have conflicting values. A psychopath may not want to take a given test, but he won't be conflicted about taking it (except in the trivial sense that he may not have made a determination as to whether it is in his practical intererest to take it). The non- psychopath test-taker is capable of internal conflict, and is likely to have mixed feelings about having to take standardized tests. He is likely to question the legitimacy of the institutional forces, and of the values embodied in those forces, responsible for his being obliged to take that test. (In any case, he is more likely to question those forces and values than the psychopath, who, after all, isn't capable of questioning them at all, since he isn't capable of grasping the concept of legitimacy.) The non- psychopath test-taker is likely to be dispirited by the spectacle of the scoliosis-ridden bureaucrat-psychologist who is administering the test and who, long since having submitted to institution-think, as anyone can plainly see, is but a shadow of what he might have been. The psychopath test-taker cannot possibly have such an involved response to his circumstances. Himself lacking a distinctively human psychological architecture, he has no conception of what it would be to forfeit one's selfhood; and,

intentional action. Since consciousness won't knowingly cooperate with a repressed emotion, the latter must cloak itself in some way if it is to avail itself of the former's assistance. (A repressed emotion is like a non-Marxist government that needs funds and thus pretends to be Marxist, so that the Soviet Union will give it money.) As a result, motivations that are consciously accepted by consciousness become vehicles for ones that are not. Since, under that circumstance, one's conscious intention is subordinate to some unconscious intention, one does a bad job of executing the former. At this point, unless one has a moment of self-discovery, which is unlikely, the person has to rationalize his poor performance. This involves altering his belief- system, his values, and his intentions in a way that validates his failure to carry out his conscious intentions. So repression is by no means innocuous. (That said, a certain amount of repression is de rigueur, for reasons that we touched in Section 7.0 of the present chapter and that we will elaborate in Section 15.0.) 
Suppose that Smith no longer cares for his wife, and in fact detests her, but desperately wants to believe that he still loves her. His repressed antagonism towards his wife is expressed in his forgetting to pick up milk on the way home, in his giving the shirt she just bought him to a drinking buddy, and so on. If Smith were conscious of his real feelings, he'd discharge them through action - by getting a divorce, or whatnot.

former kind: values that cannot be fulfilled are likely to be rooted in wish-driven, as opposed to fact-driven, beliefs as to how the world works; and to be mentally ill is to see things, not as they are, but as one wants them to be. A sane person could choose to exchange his grim, actual existence for a pleasant, cyber-existence. But such a person would know what he was doing; he would be all too aware of the difference between fact and fiction. If he weren't, he wouldn't need the help of a virtual reality machine to make life bearable: his own mind would be enough; it would mediate the requisite pseudo-realities. It isn't living in a dream-world that's insane. What's insane is living in a dream world that one is trying to believe is not a dream world. What makes it pathological to retreat into fantasy is the self-deception involved: one must tell oneself that the fantasy in question is reality. (The person who lives in cyber-reality isn't lying to himself.) This means that one must devalue the truth and, therefore, that one must ultimately deny that there is such a thing as truth. The inhabitant of virtual reality is all too aware of the distinction between fact and fiction; it is because he is aware of it that he chose to live in virtual-reality. The person who retreats into fantasy is in a different category: his very own mind is the virtual reality machine. So he isn't aware of the difference between fact and fiction. He sees them as interchangeable. This means he no longer has the concept of truth and therefore cannot value the truth. This means that he values nothing.

And if you tell him otherwise, you are being a weak, dishonest coward. Even if, upon answering your boss's query with a "yes," you don't quite feel like a dishonest coward, the reason being that, relative to your actual beliefs, you were being honest, you must add the following proposition to your operative-belief set (namely, B1...B, S): 
(S*) I am a dishonest coward who, at the moment of truth, chose to forfeit his integrity rather than imperil a temporary source of income.

On this basis you know that: (DT) Any evidence to the effect that so and so has M confirms a proposition that, if true, invalidates my belief-system and, therefore, my very self.

Given (i)-(iii), you would be mortally afraid of just the sorts of things that confirm GC, but you wouldn't know that it was GC that they confirmed. You would only know that they confirmed some truth that would destroy you, were you to know it. Without having any idea what that truth is, you know that your knowing it would ruin you psychologically, and you know exactly what sorts of situations to avoid if you are to remain ignorant of it.

The things you must do to do well at this game are identical with the things you had to do to do well at the other game. Thus, to do well at this game, you must deoperationalize your knowledge of GC, and you must make sure that you don't deoperationalize your knowledge of DT, AE, or DE. 
Successfully deoperationalizing your knowledge of GC involved deoperationalizing an entire constellation of beliefs and emotions. It involved deoperationalizing any inferences you might have made on the basis of GC. It also involved deoperationalizing the beliefs underlying GC's emotional concomitants; and to that extent deoperationalizing those concomitants themselves.

henceforth refer to the (pre)conscious part of a given person's integration as his "pc- integration.") We've seen that deoperationalizing one belief involves deoperationalizing entire networks of propositional attitudes. Obviously these systemic changes don't occur instantaneously. But over time, the subject's psychological pc-integration undergoes the changes needed to validate the deoperationalization of B. 
To clarify this last point: B won't remain deoperationalized if all of the beliefs etc. that brought it into existence and that it brought into existence are operational. Supposing that P is the proposition the subject believed-true by virtue of having B, it would rapidly become glaringly obvious to the subject that P was true, or, at any rate, was true if various other beliefs of his were true. As a result, B would be reoperationalized. (Or – what would come to the same thing - a belief to the same effect as B (viz. one that constituted acceptance of P) would be generated.) So the subject's psyche must undergo many changes if the deoperationalization of B is to hold. And each one of those changes will increase the degree to which B is estranged from the subject's pc-integration. 
8.3.5 After a certain point, even if B is still conscious, the subject won't identify with it. It will be "ego-dystonic." Not only will B not be a part of the subject's preconscious integration: that integration will consist of beliefs, and other propositional attitudes,

We'll see in the next section that there are two very different kinds of compulsions: those resulting from a conflict between one's ego and one's id, and those resulting from a conflict within one's ego. Addiction-based compulsions are of the first kind. OCD-based compulsions, though involving conflicts of the first kind, are themselves of the second kind. 
9.1 Those who claim that the obsessive-compulsive cannot help acting as he does are failing to make three distinctions. They are failing to distinguish involuntary behaviors from compulsively performed acts. They are failing to distinguish compulsively performed acts from acts performed under duress. Finally, they are failing to distinguish mind-internal conflict from self-internal conflict.

The junkie's egocentric belief is that it's in his interest to shoot up; his non-egocentric belief is that it is not; the first belief determines what he does if he gives into his addiction, and the second belief determines it if he doesn't. The addict's struggle is of the same kind as that of the person who's trying to lose weight but wants to eat desert. The struggle raging within the obsessive-compulsive is not of this kind. In his case, the war is between two non-egocentric value-systems, each of them legitimate. 
Smith, an arbitrary obsessive-compulsive, is an extremely talented xylophone player. He wants to be a professional xylophone player; and were he to become one, he'd wake up every morning happy to go to work. But Smith doesn't just want to have a good time. He wants his life to have meaning. Smith wants to make a contribution to humanity. 
To be sure, it's one thing to have a meaningful life, and it's quite another to help humanity's lot. It is by virtue of being true to oneself that one's life is meaningful; it isn't by virtue of helping others — unless, fortuitously, it is by helping others that one is true to oneself. And unless one's life is meaningful, it cannot be principled, except in an empty formal sense: the life of a hollowed out husk is not one of principle. (Altruistic robots don't even have lives, let alone ones of principle.) Being an intelligent authentic person, Smith is (in some way, and at some level) aware of these heterodox truths.

One sends the opposite message by living altruistically, unless, in so living, one is being true to oneself. 
Given Smith's earnest, young man's belief that his parents and teachers have his best interest at heart, and his equally jejune belief that they both know what it is in his interest to do and want him to do it, it is no wonder that Smith has been slow to give due credit to his suspicions as to the veracity and also, more darkly, the sincerity of the orthodoxies propounded by these standard-bearers; and given how much ugliness he'd have to trudge through to do so, it is no wonder that he hasn't yet so conceptualized and otherwise refined those suspicions as to enable them take a firm and uncontested hold of the reigns of agency. Smith is the quintessential obsessivecompulsive. His heart is at war with his head. What his heart believes is true. What his head believes is not. His head prevails for now. But its tenure is insecure: since it's on the wrong side of the Smith's psychological architecture, Smith must be subdued if it is to retain its hegemony. And until Smith is duly subdued, his heart will express itself in counter-hegemonic ways. Smith's actions won't be pure. His conscious intention will be to do one thing; his unconscious intention will be to do the opposite. The result will be a failure to do either properly. Smith's commitment to the aspirations to which he has consciously dedicated himself will be subject to constant

disruptions. He doesn't feel like working. Or he does feel like working, but he has writer's block. Or he doesn't have writer's black, but he's too torpid to articulate the thoughts that are coming to him, since half his energy is spent fighting a nagging feeling that what he's doing isn't what he should be doing. 
OCD is a war between the head and the heart. The heart has the right beliefs; the head has the wrong ones. The head calls the shots. The heart follows. But the heart, doubtful of the head's legitimacy, takes every available opportunity to stymie the head's intentions. Its legitimacy under constant attack from the heart, the head begins to question its own legitimacy, a likely result being a lack of enthusiasm for its own designs and a consequent failure to execute them properly. The head takes defensive measures. Despite - or because of - the illegitimacy of its own plans, the head becomes maniacally dedicated to carrying out those plans, and it becomes particularly unwilling to question even the slightest detail of its intended way of doing so. For such questioning would activate the head's doubts as to the legitimacy of those plans themselves. Thus, to suppress the constant, deprecatory whisperings of the heart, the

and sexual impulses. (The obsessive-compulsive absolutely never gives into such impulses. (Salzman (1994) states this clearly. So do Freud (1926), Reich (1945), and Stekel (1949).) He is much too scrupulous and intact to do so.) But this struggle is merely a consequence, and not the essence, of the struggle that constitutes OCD. Smith wants to be a xylophonist. And though a deracinated, emptily logical faculty of his judges that he shouldn't become one, he knows deep down that it's what he must do. It's only because he can't articulate the grounds for these knowledge-constitutive beliefs of his that they aren't fully conscious and, therefore, that they do don't determine what he does with his life. Smith's stodgy and not entirely well-intentioned parents want him to become a lawyer. He recoils at the thought. But he can compatibilize the thought of his being a lawyer with the part of his mind that makes decisions on narrowly logical and social grounds. He cannot thus compatibilize the thought of his being a xylophonist. But since he knows deep down that lawyering is the wrong path, he is deeply enraged at his parents. But even though his rage is legitimate, he isn't fully convinced of that fact. (This is only partly because he can't compatibilize with it the rigid protocols governing his conscious morality-related thoughts. It is also because that rage is so anathema to his conscious world view that he has no choice but to but to repress it.) His compulsive behaviors and endless ruminations are bulwarks against the violent impulses he has towards these people, whom he is supposed to love and whom, to a considerable extent, he really does love.

therefore hyper-charging them. Because of this reallocation of energy, a few select cognitive structures become repositories for the all the energy of which the subject's remaining psychical faculties are being deprived.) So it cannot reasonably be maintained that the obsessional "cannot help" doing what he's doing. 
In fact, the exquisite distress of the obsessional lies in the very fact that the behaviors characteristic of his condition are voluntary. If they were involuntary, he could just surrender to them; there would be no anxiety or inner turmoil. But inner turmoil is the very essence of OCD. The afflicted subject's obsessions and compulsions are but ways of managing this turmoil. 
The obsessive-compulsive asks: "What sort of person should I be?" The junkie asks: "Should I even be a person?" In giving into heroin-addiction, one is making one's personhood a mere means for somatic gratification. The committed junkie has no internal conflicts at all; any struggles she has are with the external world. The reluctant junkie is indeed struggling. But it isn't a struggle between two sets of values or two spheres of agency. It's a struggle between being an agent and being a non- agent. The junkie's compulsions are mind-internal, but not self-internal. 
The obsessive-compulsive's struggle is self-internal, and not merely mind-internal. For his is a struggle between two value-systems and, therefore, between two spheres of agency. That is what explains the exquisitely painful nature of his compulsions. When resisting a compulsion, the force against which the obsessive-compulsive is

Therefore, B doesn't engage the reigns of agency. (ii) S does not know how to articulate B, and although S accepts B or wants very much to accept it, since his intuitions urge him to do so he doesn't consciously know how to justify B. He can't compatibilize an acceptance of B with the canons of reasoning that he consciously accepts. (Those canons may govern either logical or moral reasoning.) Therefore, even though he knows deep down that B is correct, S does not consciously accept it. (iii) B is genuinely unconscious. The problem isn't that S can't articulate B; nor is it that he can't justify it. It's that he isn't aware of B's existence. If B is unconscious in this last sense, let us say, following Freud, that that it is "dynamically" unconscious. If B is conscious in the first sense, let us say that it is "articulation-unconscious," and that it's "justification-unconscious" if it's unconscious in the second sense. (Since the distinction between articulation-unconsciousness and justification-unconsciousness isn't important in the present context, we will sometimes lapse and use the term "articulation-unconsciousness" to refer to both.) 
Some authorities hold that all unconsciousness is unconsciousness is 
articulationunconsciousness. To be sure, articulation-unconsciousness is an extremely important kind of unconsciousness. We've argued at length that it's what we can articulate, not what we know, that distinguishes us from the brutes.

Each such session left me feeling completely appalled, and in each case that reaction of mine had more than one source of justification. First of all, setting aside those session-attendees who didn't talk at all, each attendee made it clear that his condition was mediated by emotional conflict, and and seldom left much doubt as to the nature of that conflict. Each said that his life-situation made it impossible for him to discharge sexual or aggressive urges that that he had; and each said that the ideation accompanying his ritualistic behaviors consisted of fantasies in which he gratified those urges. Many an attendee reported that similar fantasies mediated his obsessions. 
In some cases, one of the attendees would describe ideation that didn't manifestly consist of a sexual or violent fantasy on his part; and in some cases, consequently, the ideation in question had to be decrypted. But was usually obvious how to do so. Two examples come to mind. One attendee talked about how, while at the funeral of somebody he loved, or supposedly loved, he was stricken by the belief that not enough blood was flowing into his foot and that, unless he repeatedly jumped up and down, thereby improving his circulation, his foot would have to be amputated.

black-listed had he so much as made a peep. His girlfriend refused to have intercourse with him, but didn't have any such reservations when it came to his best friend. His boss gave the account to a nephew, instead of to him, even though the nephew was an incompetent drunkard, whereas he had made a fortune for the firm. 
And yet the therapist running the session said that this person's obsessions and compulsions were the results of "defective brain-circuitry.” His condition didn't have an emotional basis: one mustn't buy in to that all pre-scientific, Freudian claptrap. No - his anterior cingulate cortex was over-active, and that was the end of it. (The therapist didn't acknowledge the fact that every psychological occurrence has a somatic basis and that, although the obsessive-compulsive's anterior cingulate cortex is indeed over-active, that means only that distinctive psychological facts have distinctive physiological implementations. Do you think that Gauss's brain would have exhibited no peculiarities? What about Shakespeare's? Would none of their brain-centers have been over-active? What about their anterior cingulate cortexes? How sure are we that they wouldn't have as active as those of the session-attendees?) The subject shouldn't analyze himself, the therapist said, or (though the therapist didn't put it this way) he should do so only to the extent that platitudinizing about his condition counts as self-analysis. In fact, the therapist said, the subject shouldn't change his life-circumstances at all, except in so far as they involved his symptomatizing. He shouldn't blame his homicidal girlfriend for his condition. (When

abominations, the obsessive-compulsive denies them all gratification. Bottled up, they assume gargantuan proportions and grotesque forms. They thus become as abominable as their host believed them to be, and now he really is under a moral imperative to suppress them. But they have become inordinately strong, and his consequently Sisyphusian efforts to suppress them are expressed as OCD-distinctive compulsions. 
In a person whose conscience is lax, such urges are capable of being discharged through socially permissible forms of conduct. Consequently, such a person's compliance with the dictates of morality isn't contingent on his engaging in the interminable rituals and obsessions on which such compliance depends in the case of the obsessive-compulsive. 
These facts about OCD are well known. In any case, my knowledge of them isn't based on what I witnessed at the meetings in question. But what I witnessed confirmed these facts, and my high estimation of the moral level of their attendees is therefore doubly justified. 
So is my high opinion of their intellectual levels. It was obvious from what they were saying that they were bright. And, it is well known, it is inherent in what OCD is that it is a thinking man's way of decompensating. Freud said that "civilization began when someone hurled an insult, instead of a rock"; and he made the equivalent point that, in the civilized person, the thought replaces the deed, whereas in his primitive

This wouldn't be feasible; it would take too long and, setting that aside, it would involve too great an expenditure of energy. A given creature simply wouldn't live long unless most of its behaviors were compulsive, as opposed to cognition-heavy; and any creature that does survive is, for that very reason, dominated by repetition-dispositive compulsions.) 
Contemporary psychiatric theory and practice make insufficient provisions for these points (the ones in the second to last paragraph), and they are therefore worth developing. 
OCD tends to afflict people who are both scrupulous and intellectual. It afflicts scrupulous people because hyper-morality is a defense against criminal impulses, and OCD is in large part a bulwark against unconscious aggression. It afflicts cerebral people because the ruminations and obsessions characteristic of the obsessive- compulsive mind are intensifications of thought, and it is only if one is intellectual that one's conflicts, when pathologized, are expressed by such intensifications. 254 Because an overly punitive conscience is a sine qua non for OCD, sociopaths and psychopaths cannot have OCD. Many a sociopath says she has OCD. So far as that isn't simply a lie, it's because purely narcissism-driven behaviors – e.g. spending 2 hours on one's nails - mimic OCD behaviors to a degree and are in a sense compulsive.

distress. But if the emphysemic took a medication that caused his otherwise unchanged airways to regain their former elasticity, he would still have emphysema. And speaking purely theoretically, a restoration of pulmonary elasticity isn't a necessary condition for a restoration of pulmonary efficiency. There could in principle exist a medication that dilated to the airways of the emphysemic to such an extent that, functionally speaking, the inelasticity of the tissue lining them ceased to matter. While under the influence of such a medication, an emphysemic's lung-tissue would be as elastic as a non-emphysemic's. So technically the emphysemic's respiratory distress is a circumstantial expression of his condition. 
Theoretically, an emphysemic's airways could be re-remodeled in such a way that they had their previous structure and for that reason had their previous degree of elasticity. Such a person would cease to have emphysema: but he might still have respiratory distress. He might have vocal chord dysfunction, which narrows major airways, or allergy-mediated asthma, which temporarily narrows intra-pulmonary airways. 
Let us discuss the bearing of these points on the nature of psychopathology. The obsessive-compulsive is indeed hobbled by his compulsions. But those are easily eliminated: if he doesn't give in to them, they become latent and eventually disappear without a trace. The same holds of the obsessive-compulsive's obsessions: if he doesn't actively work out their ramifications or otherwise indulge them, they become

taxonomies, not theories. This is exactly what pre-Freudian psychologists did; and modern psychology (or what used to be modern psychology) began when Freud distinguished between structural and purely descriptive diagnostic methods, thereby refuting the theoretical underpinnings of taxonomy-orientied psychological research- programs. The discipline of cognitive science began when Chomsky replaced Skinnerian descriptivism with Freudian structuralism. Chomsky himself says that it was by generalizing Freud's structuralism that he was able to make his epoch-making discoveries.256. 
And yet all this progress is being undone under the banner of "science." It isn't "scientific" to posit unconscious psychological structure. (In other words, doing so is contraindicated, relative to an acceptance of empiricism.) Where Freud spoke of the unconscious, we are told, real scientists speak of pure physiology. We have seen why it is illogical, and therefore unscientific, to physiologicize the unconscious. People with OCD tend to be highly intelligent. If such a person questions a given proposition, he probably has a good reason for doing so. The OCD-sufferer's intellectual deficits may only be apparent if one considers the totality of his intellectual work-product. It may be that any two-page article that he writes is creditable. But a thousand two-page articles don't necessarily embody a cogent system of thought, and the intellectual attrition induced by OCD is typically apparent only if one looks at patterns of statements (or articles or egg-timers, etc.).257 The rigid

Q A 
To be sure, a neurosis is, by definition, an illness. But neurosis is a healthy person's way of pathologizing. A precondition for neurosis is a structurally intact mind. The neurotic mind is like a car with an improperly installed battery. Structurally, such a car differs only infinitesimally from an otherwise identical car with a properly installed batter. But, as Freud (1926) observed, tiny structural differences translate into vast functional differences. The other side of the coin is that vast gains in functionality can be achieved, and achieved rapidly, by those whose functional impairments express minor structural problems. Where neuroses are concerned, the diminution of performance is grossly disproportionate to the disturbances that give rise to them. This bodes well for the neurotic: it means that, even though his condition is crippling while it lasts, he stands to make a relatively speedy recovery. (The operative word is "relatively": it takes years, as Freud said and as every analyst knows, to loosen the resistances that sustain a neurosis.) A neurosis is like a severe case of pneumonia had by somebody who is basically healthy: he's completely non- operational while ill, but he isn't ill for long, and his recovery is complete. A healthy person's pneumonia is system-internal: it inhibits his metabolism's ability to function, but it doesn't corrupt his metabolism itself. It's only because his metabolism is intact that he can recover; a broken metabolism can't fix itself. So far as pneumonia affects one's metabolism, it is by affecting one's lungs. Pneumonia is primarily a pulmonary disorder, and only secondarily, if at all, a metabolic disorder.

and psychopathy and are less serious than they 
are. To be sure, sufficiently grave system-internal condition can lead to system- remodeling. That said, psychosis, even in its more severe forms, is a disturbance of what, ultimately, is a feasible integration, whereas sociopathy and psychopthy are not disturbances of integrations, but are themselves integrations, whose very presence means that that the person has, as it were, become the disease and, consequently, the concept of recovery ceases to have any meaning. The distinction between systemic and system-internal psychopathologies is one that has made little or no appearance in the literature, despite its obvious theoretical and psychotherapeutic significance. 
The elimination of anxiety should not be an objective of psychotherapeutic treatment. The ability to tolerate anxiety should be such an objective. There are two ways of extirpating anxiety. One is by improving one's life in such a way that the anxiety in question is no longer appropriate. The other is to self-remodel, so as to blind oneself to the source of the anxiety. This self-remodelling is identical with sociopathogenesis, as we will now see.

to "rationalize" data is to provide a coherent model for it; it is to posit unobservables to account for observables. It is by successfully modeling data that science advances and apprises us of truths about the world of which we'd be ignorant, were our spheres of knowledge limited to what commonsense can reveal to us. 
Relative to the other sense of the word, to “rationalize” data is to model it with the intention of seeing things as one wants them to be, not as they are. A rationalization is a model that one produces and accepts because one wants to believe it to be true, not because one really does believe it to be true. 
Relative to both senses of the word, to “rationalize” is to model data. 
It might be thought that emotion-driven rationalizations are ipso facto pathological, and that the distinction between healthy and pathological 
rationalizations is that the former are intended to unveil the truth whereas the latter 
are intended to bury it. 
This is not correct. Although all pathological cases of rationalization are attempts to bury the truth, not all attempts to bury the truth are pathological. The mind has limited resources at its disposal. It has limited energy, storage space, and intelligence. Mentation would grind to a halt if all of one's beliefs were operational. Some of one's beliefs must therefore be sequestered. Since access-conscious beliefs are ipso facto operational, the requisite belief-sequestration involves rendering some of one's beliefs access-unconscious; it involves repressing them, in other words.

there is no such number. To take a less trivial example: while it's obviously on the basis of a musical work's structural features that we like it, there is little chance that we'll ever produce a general characterization of the relevant structural virtues of so much as a single piece of music. 
259. The best such attempt is found in Nagel (1962). I know that other philosophers, most of them empiricists, have rejected it. But I do not personally know that it fails; and when reading it, I didn't notice any logical errors. My reservations about it had to do with the fact that Nagel was clearly producing this analysis post hoc, so as to validate his empiricism. It is a very intricate analysis, which no one would think of unless they had an ulterior motive. 
That said, deteleologicizing our world-view would vitiate it. A blind person's eyes are defective. Eyes are supposed to see. That's their job. This is a datum. So far as philosophers deny it, they're victims of their own artifices. 
In some contexts, an organ's job is to help its owner carry out an intention of his. In a context where my intention is to play the piano, my hands exist to help me carry out that intention. But what a given organ is supposed to do isn't always determined what its owner's objectives are. Even in a context where a person's intention is to blind himself, his eyes exist to give him sight. 
A person who intends to blind himself is mentally ill. His eyes have a job to do. It's

Aristotle's intelligence could be so egregiously wrong as to such obvious organ-related facts, can it with any plausibility be supposed that, so far as one's gall-bladder has a purpose, or one's endocrinal gland, it is only derivatively of its owner's objectives?) Equivalently, what an organ is supposed to be doing can be, and often is, figured out independently of what it is actually doing. A given organ O that isn't doing X may clearly be responsible for doing X. Given (i) O's internal structure; (ii) O's relations to other organs; and (iii) the metabolic consequences of O's not doing X; it may be clear that (iv) O's job is to do X. O's host-organism is a well-organized part of nature; it is not possible to understand nature without understanding that organism or, if not that specific organism, others of its kind. O's failing to do X would discontinue that organism's existence, thereby increasing entropy and degrading the explanatory structure of the universe. So "O is supposed to do X" isn't a veiled way of saying "O usually does X," or "organs like O usually do X," or "O's owner wants it to do X." Rather, "O is supposed to do X" means: "If O does X, the universe is more intelligible, other things being equal, than if O does not do X." 
Thus, when we talk about what eyes "should" do, we aren't referring to the intentions of creatures with eyes. We aren't talking about what anybody wants. We are talking about the structural integrity of the universe. A world of sick creatures is more entropic than a world of healthy creatures; a world of no biological creatures is more entropic than a world of sick biological creatures; and so on.

should have thought otherwise: "The universe is like a pinball machine; its occupants are like the ball," it is thought. "The laws governing it are like the bumpers and rivulets that govern the ball's motion." Not great thinking, but not obviously ludicrous. 
Hume and Peirce deny that anything makes anything happen. One would think them innocent of the pinball-machine conception of natural law. One couldn't be more wrong. In saying that nothing makes anything happen, they were saying that, if anything made anything happen, it would be in consequence of structural facts about the universe: the Great Pinball-Machine would be running the show. And it was because they were empiricists that they adopted the no-cause view (NCV); it wasn't because they had misgivings concerning the Pinball-Machine view (PMV). On the contrary, it was precisely because they accepted PMV that they embraced NCV. By itself, empiricism doesn't demand acceptance of NCV. On the contrary, it demands its rejection. We feel forces; we feel them all the time; not a moment passes when we don't feel them. (A psychoanalytically minded author might say that NCV was an attempt to negate the obvious, and obviously unpleasant, fact that we are at all times under the dominion of forces of which wed like nothing more than to be free. NCV's lack of merit supports this view, as does its intuition-unfriendliness.) Outside of physics, correlations don't correlate with laws, and non-physicists who believe otherwise are doing their respective disciplines a disservice.

an actor may have become an independent variable, so to speak, to be evaluated on its own terms. “Rationalization-caused” # “Rationalization-constituted.") 
2.1 Here we have an instance of a rationalization that is counterproductive. But is it pathological? Not necessarily, as an extension of our story shows. It isn't part of a larger pattern. It isn't part of a general failure to be honest with myself. I generally do my best to see things as they are, as opposed to how I want them to be. 
I obviously fail from time to time. Instead of admitting that person X is simply a better mathematician than I am, and that it was fitting that he, not I, should win the such and such prize, I tell myself that he's the beneficiary of a corrupt system. 
But I don't deny the legitimacy of the other mathematician's findings. I don't ignore their relevance to my own work, and when I'm reading his work, any thoughts about him or the prize melt away: I am completely absorbed in the formulas before me. 
If my bitterness affected my work as a mathematician, then we'd be dealing with a very different and much less innocuous sort of rationalization: one that was not only counterproductive but pathological, and not only pathological but sociopathogenic. A sociopathenic rationalization is that turns one into a sociopath. It does this by corrupting one's conscience, eroding one's values, and thereby undermining one's agency, rationality (not to be confused with intelligence), and therefore one's very self. Let us now discuss sociopathy.

terms as I will use them. 264 But, so far as I've researched the matter, those who currently use them as I will categorically hold that what they call "psychopathy" is merely a more severe form of what they call "sociopathy." The sociopath's behavior is indeed far less deviant from the psychopath's. But what they are calling "sociopathy" is a different affliction from what they call "psychopathy." Sociopathy is not a mild form of psychopathy; they are distinct disorders, albeit ones that are identical in certain key respects. 
3.1 The nature of sociopathization is best understood in terms of the answer to the question: Why do people rationalize in counterproductive ways? Two reasons. First, it's easier to fantasize than to act. It's easier to have a billion imaginary dollars than it is to have 10,000 actual dollars.265 
Second, a rationalization may be counterproductive in one way but productive in another: it may guarantee survival but prohibit growth. The boot-licker keeps his job, but only by diminishing himself; and in rationalizing his toadyism, he exchanges the uncertainties of a life of meaning for the certainties of one devoid of it. 
An illustration: Sally is is a young and attractive woman. She is also a literary genius. She has the potential to be the greatest novelist of all time. But she has yet to cultivate her genius; and her works, though clearly the works of a genius, are not themselves works of genius. As she knows, if she cultivates her abilities, then in

Q A 
Obviously such flights per se have no evolutionary raison d'être. But the ability to take refuge in fantasy is a concomitant of a hypertrophied intellect, and the latter obviously does have survival value. 
Tim has merit. He's supremely intelligent, in fact, in the commerce-related ways one must be to make a $1,000,000,000. But Sally doesn't love Tim. She just doesn't. Her dreams are not his. What she finds funny leaves Tim cold, and vice versa. Also, Tim is extremely controlling. If Sally married him, she wouldn't have the sort of lifestyle that would allow her to continue with her writing. Sally would have to self- lobotomize in order to tolerate being married to him. Sally is dimly aware of these characteristics of Tim's and of their consequences for her, should she marry him. But the operative word is "dimly." It takes time to distinguish between a strong, decisive person and a controlling person; and since Tim is strong, as well as controlling, it's easy to see controlling behaviors on his part as signs of strength. 
Also, Tim is reasonably physically attractive. And he is principled. He is not a nice person, but he made his money in an honest manner and is scrupulous in his transactions with others. Also, Tim routinely treats Sally to fun activities, like hanggliding, which Bill doesn't have the money for. So even though Sally wouldn't dump Bill for Tim unless Tim had money, Tim would still have some allure for her, and shed definitely date him if Bill weren't in the picture. Given that Tim has unlimited funds, whereas Bill has none, the situation is decidedly ambiguous.

: Q A 
Being married to Bill would have felt good. But my relationship with Bill was childish; it was as boy and girl that we loved each other. Bill and I love each other as man and woman.268 
And Tim and I do love each other. My love for Tim doesn't feel like my former love for Bill. And perhaps it's not as pleasurable. But it's real. What Bill and I had was a fantasy. Being with Bill was like playing Monopoly: it was amusing. Marrying Bill would have been like trying to use Monopoly money to buy a car: it would have been 
unfeasible. 
I admire Tim. Tim is a real man. He knows how the world works. He knows that it's 
a dog-eat-dog world out there. Tim has strength to see things as they are. 
Bill was a wimp. He thought his arcane books actually meant something. Bill was clever. He had raw intelligence. But to what use did he put his intelligence? To splitting hairs and dialecticizing about useless subjects. None of his activities were remunerative. While that fact did not by itself drain those activities of meaning, it corresponded to a fact about them that did do so. Bill's failure to make money was a reflection of a failure to go out into the world and stake his claim. It was also a reflection of his inability to have meaningful relations with other human beings. So it wasn't Bill's having no money that bothered me; it was what it showed me about his character. It showed me that he never grew up. He intellectualized so that he could forever remain a child. Instead of ditching his imaginary childhood friends, he just

values, her aspirations and also - because she found Bill physically attractive - her biological drives. 
So SC is not something Sally can really believe - at least not the Sally that Bill knew, or the Sally who wrote those brilliant novels. The things that SC describes as “whims,” “amusements,” etc., were rooted in Sally's values; and if Sally had fulfilled the demands imposed on her by those values, the result would have been an expansion of her sphere of awareness, of both herself and the world, and also of the jurisdiction of her agency. The more one knows about the world, the more one can control it. The more one knows about oneself, the more one can control oneself. 
Even if SC is something that somebody could genuinely accept, Sally was not such a person at the time Tim proposed to her. By then, she was an extremely developed, mature, multifaceted human being. She had a powerful vision for herself, and a coherent set of values. Her emotions, aspirations, desires, and objectives were all hewed to that vision and those values. Sally had spent years working on a manuscript which, she rightly believed, would set a new standard in Proust scholarship. She was on her way to writing the next War and Peace. To the extent that she succeeds in operationalizing SC, all of skills involved in those endeavors are meaningless, as are the values underlying them. 
Whether Sally's pre-Tim values were good or bad is irrelevant. What is relevant is that they were her values. They were the nucleus of her agency. She had to stay true to

therefore obliterate his mind.271 
Q A 
3.3 The consequences of Sally's self-remodeling are ruinous. There are two reasons for this. First, she effectively voided her mind of everything she previously knew, as she cast all such knowledge outside the sphere of agency and her consciousness. What 
269. I am liberally paraphrasing. Mao's physician informed him that he had halitosis, serious gingivitis, as well as at least one venereal disease. The physician told Mao that his halitosis would repulse his lady-friends and that also, unless he took precautions, he would transmit his venereal diseases to them. Referring to his halitosis and suppurating gums, Mao said: "Does a tiger brush its teeth?" He made a similar comment about his venereal problems. He meant: "I'm a tiger; tigers must be tigers, not lambs." 
I do not know how many venereal diseases Mao had, or which ones. My source, Li Zhisui (1996), Mao's personal physician for thirty years, withholds that information. The author wrote a voluminous work about his time with Mao, which is remarkably candid and oftentimes deeply critical of Mao's character. But there were some things the author simply was not at liberty to disclose. 
270. I say all of this only to make it clear what I believe; for those beliefs presumably infiltrate the arguments set forth in the present work and the reader will be better able
