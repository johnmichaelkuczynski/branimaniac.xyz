A 
DIALOGUE 
ABOUT 
GOD 
MAX 
KHAN 


STUDENT: 
MASTER, 
WOULD 
AN 
ALL-KNOWING 
BEING 
BE 
CAPABLE 
OF 
ACTION? 
MASTER: 
NO. 
ACTION 
PRESUPPOSES 
IGNORANCE. 
IF 
YOU 
KNOW 
WITH 
CERTAINTY, 
WHAT 
IS 
GOING 
TO 
HAPPEN, 
YOU 
CANNOT 
COHERENTLY 
ATTEMPT 


TO 
INFLUENCE 
WHAT 
IS 
GOING 
TO 
HAPPEN 
AND 
YOU 
CAN 
THEREFORE 
CANNOT 
INTENT 
TO 
ACT. 
STUDENT: 
WOULD 
AN 
ALL-POWERFUL 
BEING 
BE 
CAPABLE 
OF 
FEELING? 
MASTER: 
NO. 
ONLY 
A 
BEING 
THAT 
IS 
CAPABLE 
OF 
BEING 
CHANGED 
CAN 


EXPERIENCE 
FEELINGS. 
AND 
IF 
A 
BEING 
IS 
CAPABLE 
OF 
BEING 
CHANGED, 
THEN 


IT 
IS 
NOT 
CAPABLE 
OF 
FEELING. 
STUDENT: 
IF 
A 
BEING 
IS 
INCAPABLE 
OF 
BEING 
CHANGED, 
IS 
IT 
ABLE 
TO 
CHANGE 
ITSELF? 


MASTER: 
NO, 
IT 
IS 
NOT. 
TO 
BE 
CHANGE 
ONESELF 
IS 
TO 
BE 
CHANGED, 
ALBEIT 
BY 
ONSELF. 
AND, 
OBVIOUSLY, 
A 
BEING 
THAT 
CANNOT 
BE 
CHANGED 
CANNOT 
BE 
CHANGED 
BY 
ANYTHING, 
INCLUDING 
ITSELF. 


STUDENT: 
CAN 
A 
BEING 
THAT 
CANNOT 
CHANGE 
ITSELF 
ACT? 
MASTER: 
NO, 
IT 
CANNOT, 
SINCE 
TO 
ACT 
IS 
TO 
CHANGE 
ONESELF. 
STUDENT: 
SO 
IF 
A 
BEING 
IS 
ALL-KNOWING 
IT 
CANNOT 
ACT, 
AND 
IF 
A 
BEING 
IS 


ALL-POWERFUL 
IT 
CANNOT 
ACT. 
MASTER: 
CORRECT. 
STUDENT: 
SO 
IF 
A 
BEING 
IS 
ALL-POWERFUL, 
IT 
IS 
COMPLETELY 
IMPOTENT. 
MASTER: 
CORRECT. 
STUDENT: 
WHAT 
ARE 
WE 
TO 
CONCLUDE 
FROM 
THIS, 
MASTER? 
MASTER: 
THAT 
THE 
CONCEPT 
OF 
AN 
ALL-POWERFUL 
BEING 
IS 
INCOHERENT? 
STUDENT: 
AND 
FOR 
SIMILAR 
REASONS, 
WE 
ARE 
ALSO 
TO 
CONCLUDE 
THAT 
THE 


CONCEPT 
OF 
AN 
ALL-KNOWING 
BEING 
IS 
INCOHERENT. 
MASTER: 
CORRECT. 
STUDENT: 
SO 
IT 
FOLLOWS 
THAT 
GOD 
DOESN’T 
EXIST, 
PRESUMABLY. 
MASTER: 
NO 
IT 
DOES 
NOT. 
WHAT 
FOLLOWS 
IS 
THAT, 
TO 
THE 
EXTENT 
THAT 
WE 


CONCEPTUALIZE 
GOD 
AS 
ALL-KNOWING 
AND 
ALL-POWERFUL, 
WE 
ARE 
CONCEPTUALIZING 
HIM 
IN 
AN 
INCOHERENT 
MANNER? 
STUDENT: 
YOU 
SEEM 
CONVINCED 
THAT 
GOD 
EXISTS, 
MASTER? 
MASTER: 
I 
AM. 



STUDENT: 
WHY, 
MASTER? 


MASTER: 
TO 
THE 
EXTENT 
THAT 
THE 
WORLD 
FALLS 
WITHIN 
THE 
SCOPE 
OF 
THE 
DISCIPLINE 
OF 
PHSYICS, 
IT 
IS 
ENTROPIC. 
IN 
OTHER 
WORDS, 
IT 
DISINTEGRATES. 
ENERGY 
ASSUMES 
INCREASINGLY 
DISORGANIZED 


STUDENT: 
RIGHT, 
THIS 
BEING 
THE 
SECOND 
LAW 
OF 
THERMODYNAMICS. 


MASTER: 
BUT 
NOTICE 
THAT, 
TO 
THE 
EXTENT 
THE 
WORLD 
FALLS 
WITHIN 
THE 
SCOPE 
OF 
BIOLOGY, 
IT 
IS 
COUNTER-ENTROPIC. 


STUDENT: 
RIGHT. 
FOR 
AN 
ORGANISM 
TO 
GROW 
AND 
DEVELOP 
IS 
FOR 
IT 
TO 
ASSUME 
AN 
INCREASINGLY 
SOPHISTICATED 
AND 
ENERGY-EFFICIENT 
FORM. 


MASTER: 
AND 
WHAT 
IS 
TRUE 
OF 
BIOLOGY 
IS 
DOUBLY 
TRUE 
OF 
PSYCHOLOGY. 


STUDENT: 
RIGHT. 
TO 
THE 
EXTENT 
THAT 
AN 
ORGANISM 
HAS 
A 
MENTAL 
DIMENSION, 
IT 
IS 
MORE 
ENERGY-EFFICIENT 
THAN 
IT 
WOULD 
OTHERWISE, 
PSYCHOLOGICAL 
GROWTH 
BEING 
A 
PARTICULARLY 
EXTREME 
WAY 
OF 
INCREASING 
AN 
ORGANISM’S 
LEVEL 
OF 
ENERGY-EFFICIENCY. 


MASTER: 
SO 
YOU 
SEE, 
MY 
SON, 
IT 
IS 
ONLY 
TO 
THE 
EXTENT 
THAT 
THE 
UNIVERSE 
IS 
DISINTEGRATING---THAT 
IT 
IS 
CEASING 
TO 
BE 
WHAT 
IT 
IS—THAT 
IT 
LACKS 
CONSCIOUSNESS; 
AND 
CONTRARIWISE, 
TO 
THE 
EXTENT 
THAT 
THE 
UNIVERSE 
IS 
GROWING—THAT 
IT 
IS 
BECOMING 
WHAT 
IT 
TRULY 
IS---IT 
HAS 
CONSCIOUSNESS. 


STUDENT: 
SO 
IT 
IS 
INHERENT 
IN 
EXISTENCE 
THAT 
EXISTENCE 
BE 
CONSCIOUS. 


MASTER: 
EXACTLY, 
IT 
BEING 
INHERENT 
NOT 
IN 
EXISTENCE, 
BUT 
ONLY 
IN 
THE 
CESSATION 
THEREOF, 
THAT 
IT 
LACK 
SENTIENCE. 


STUDENT: 
AND 
GIVEN 
THAT 
EXISTENCE 
IS 
INHERENTLY 
SENTIENT, 
THERE 
IS 
IPSO 
FACTO 
A 
GOD. 


MASTER: 
EXACTLY, 
THAT 
GOD 
BEING 
THE 
UNIVERSE 
ITSELF. 


STUDENT: 
WITH 
THE 
QUALIFICATION 
THAT 
THE 
UNIVERSE 
ITSELF, 
FAR 
FROM 
BEING 
THE 
COLD 
AND 
MECHANICAL 
BEING 
DESCRIBED 
BY 
PHYSICS, 
IS, 
IN 
THE 
FINAL 
ANALYSIS, 
PULSATING 
WITH 
LIFE 
AND 
THOUGHT. 


MASTER: 
PRECISELY, 
MY 
SON. 
PRECISELY.
