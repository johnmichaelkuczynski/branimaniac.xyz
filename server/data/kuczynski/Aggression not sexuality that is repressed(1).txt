It is Aggression, not Sexuality, that is the Primary Object of Repression
J.-M. Kuczynski

We repress both our aggression and our sexuality. But, I submit, we repress our sexuality only to the extent that it is informed by aggression—in other words, sexuality is repressed only to the extent that it is itself a variety of aggression. We repress aggressive impulses when they endanger ourselves. It is only if it is dangerous for me to cop to a given aggressive impulse—it is only if I believe it to be a threat to my own safety to have that impulse---that I repress it. It is only when two conditions are met that I repress a given impulse: first, I believe that my acting on that impulsive would threaten me; second, I believe that my having that impulsive in consciousness would make me likely to act on it. In general, it is only when the presence of a conceit in consciousness is a threat to the subject that the subject represses it.  
And it is only when sexuality is infused with aggression that it is a threat to the subject’s own safety. Of course, masochistic sexual urges are often the targets of repression—but only because masochism is inverted aggression: aggression that is turned against oneself. In fact, masochism is itself a form of repression: masochism is sadism that is turned against the subject’s self since, when it was directed towards others, the subject felt that it would endanger him by incurring the wrath of others. 
In any case, it is only to the extent that sexuality is aggressive in nature that it is a candidate for repression. There is such a thing as benign sexuality; it may even be that sexuality is inherently benign---and that, so far as it is aggressive, it is because aggression infiltrated it.  But when, for whatever reason, sexuality is aggressive, it can, by being a threat to others, be a threat to the subject himself; and it is only then that the subject has an incentive to repress it.
