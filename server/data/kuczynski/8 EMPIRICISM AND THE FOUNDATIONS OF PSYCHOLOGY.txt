It's because, although their minds do mediate it, they don't do so at the right level: they do so at the subpersonal, not the personal level, the result being that, although your beloved Rover's mind is replete with intelligence, Rover per se - the lovable, dopy entity that wags its tail when it sees you - is not very intelligent at all. Rationality is personal, as opposed to subpersonal, intelligence. More precisely, it is personal intelligence that is deployed in ways that are to one's advantage.

Q A 
10.2 What is it that transfers intelligence from the subpersonal stratum of mentation to the personal stratum? (For reasons that we'll come to, "transfers" isn't quite the right word, but it will do for now.) The nucleus of the personal stratum is consciousness, and the essence of consciousness is phenomenology. Even our own propositional attitudes are knowable to us only to the extent that they are phenomenologized. 
I am referring to the so-called 'conscious' propositional attitudes: those that are access-conscious, to use Ned Block's term, or preconscious, to use Freud's. I am setting aside those that are repressed, it being obvious that those propositional attitudes are knowable only through their phenomenological (and behavioral) derivatives. 
Also, repressed propositional attitudes are not intrinsically different from unrepressed ones. The sorts of beliefs and sentiments that are repressed are just like those that are unrepressed. There is no intrinsic difference between repressed and a preconscious hatred of one's father. The difference lies in where such hatred is located in one's mind, not in what it is. We have direct knowledge of the one, but not of the other. But that means that our epistemic relation to the one is different from our epistemic relation to the other, not that those attitudes per se differ from each other. For ideation to be transferred, so to speak, from the subpersonal to the personal domain, it must be phenomenologized. The word "transfer," be it noted, has to be

anything; no intelligence deserts it.) We will now clarify these points; and having done that, we will try to say why, if true, they would account for the delight we take in music. 
Consciousness is the nucleus of the personal stratum of mentation. Consciousness qua consciousness is not intelligent; to the extent that it mediates thought, it mediates picture-thought, which is the lowest form of thought. (In fact, picture-thought isn't thought at all. Thoughts are judgments. Pictures aren't judgments, and neither are sequences of pictures.) The subpersonal, on the other hand, is inherently intelligent, and whatever intelligence is to be found in the personal stratum of awareness is bequeathed to it by the subpersonal. By "musicalizing" subpersonal processes, we make them perceptible: we give them a tangible, consciousness-accessible form, and we thus endow consciousness with a certain acuity that it otherwise lacks. 
The delight we take in music is a form of the delight we take in acquiring knowledge. People are identical with their minds. Therefore one is only as big as one's mind. The delight we take in the acquisition of knowledge is therefore a derivative of our survival-instinct. More precisely, it is one of the forms that our survival-instinct takes when it is so remodeled as to fit into our rationality-mediated integrations.

good. To a creature endowed with a self, its body's well-being is but an instrument for its well being, that is, for its self's well being. So, for such a creature, neutralizing a threat (e.g. killing a hissing rattlesnake) is but a means to an end, that end being its – i.e. its self's — welfare. But, for such a creature, it is an intrinsic good to finally be able to see, and absorb into its agency, and therefore its self, hitherto unobservable thought-processes. For in acquiring such self-knowledge, it expands the sphere of its 
agency. 
11.1 Subpersonal mentation is inherently intelligent. Personal mentation is inherently unintelligent. Personal mentation, so far as it represents anything, consists of pictures. Neither pictures nor the things they represent confirm or entail anything; nor, therefore, do they disconfirm or entail the negation of anything. Personal mentation comprises sensations, as well as pictures. But sensations are obviously no more capable than imagery of mediating rational thought. 
Personal mentation becomes ratiocinative when it becomes rule-governed. But now we have a problem on our hands. We've given two, seemingly different explanations as to what is responsible for the transference to the personal level of subpersonal, ratiocinative ideation. On the one hand, we've said that this transference involves

our self-objectifications are not answerable to standards and therefore aren't rational. But when those effusions are governed, not by customs, but by meta-customs, they are no longer directly answerable to the good graces of one's peers; they are at that point directly answerable to canons of logic. And it is only at this point that our conscious, icon-mediated ideation truly duplicates or shadows our subpersonal mentation. For our subpersonal mentation is rule-governed, that being why it mediates rational thought; and, consequently, our conscious ideation is not governed by any such strictures, and therefore isn't hewed to our subpersonal mentation, until it is rule-governed. And, as just stated, it isn't rule-governed until customs give way to meta-customs, which then convert the just-mentioned customs into rules.

And once that distinction is drawn, we will also find, it becomes clear what it is that makes human beings different from animals: it becomes clear what it is to have a distinctively human psychological architecture, and it therewith becomes clear how rationality is different from intelligence and how rationality is not different from agency. 
The philosophical knowledge we are about to acquire will give us empirical knowledge. It will give us knowledge of the structures of certain widespread and theoretically significant forms of psychopathology. The theoretical importance of these forms of psychopathology is that they target one's psychological architecture itself. Unlike obsessive compulsive disorder, and even schizophrenia, they are not architecture-internal. The obsessive-compulsive's psychological architecture is overly intact, it being its consequent inelasticity that manifests itself as OCD-distinctive obsessions and compulsions. Unlike the obsessive-compulsive's mind, the schizophrenic's is in disarray. But he is still the person he was before he had his last episode, and after taking a few halidals he will be that person again. The psychopathologies to which I am referring involve a dismantling of the very structure of the psyche. So whereas even the most severe forms of schizoaffective disorder involve disorganizations of the contents of one's psyche, they leave its basic structure 
intact.

1.2 It is often said that a person's linguistic competence is both causally responsible for and constitutive of his ability to grasp properties and other non-spatiotemporal entities. 
田 
This position is untenable. A language is a set of semantic rules: it is a set of rules $1...S such that, for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), there is some expression E1 such that S1 assigns a meaning (a referent, a property or function, or a proposition) to E1. There are two kinds of semantic rules: those that are primitive and those that are derived. The latter consist of other semantic rules; the former do not. The semantic rule that assigns David Bowie to "David Bowie" is primitive; it cannot be broken down into other rules. This is not true of the semantic rule that assigns a proposition to tokens of "it was with a heavy heart and an empty stomach that Rupert went to sleep that night." 
A semantic rule is a proposition. If I am to use a token of "David Bowie” in a distinctively linguistic way, I must grasp the proposition that "David Bowie" refers to David Bowie, this proposition being the relevant semantic rule. It follows that I

You know the semantic consequences of replacing the occurrence of "snow" in that sentence with "grass.” In other words, your self has this knowledge. Your subpersonal mind also has it. But what matters in this context is that you have it as well. 
2.0 That said, language-comprehension is mediated by subpersonal processes. Upon hearing a sentence of your native tongue, you understand it automatically. This doesn't mean that thought didn't mediate between your hearing it and your understanding it. It means that the relevant thought-processes were unconscious. Those processes obviously weren't unconscious in the personal, Freudian sense. They were therefore unconscious in the impersonal, Chomskyan sense. 
At the same time, anyone who is linguistically competent ipso facto knows, not subpersonally but personally, what is meant by each of many simple expressions and also by each member of a finite but unbounded class of complex expressions composed out of those simples ones; and for many a complex expression <x1..........X1> that he understands, he knows how that n-tuple's meaning would change if, holding everything else constant, x1 (1 ≤ i ≤ n) were to be replaced by a grammatically comparable expression j1, assuming he knows the latter's meaning.

(iii) linguistic competence isn't what constitutes rationality (contrary to what Wittgenstein, Davidson, McDowell, and countless others hold). 
3.0 Linguistic competence enormously facilitates thought. Indeed, linguistic competence is a sine qua non for rationality, as we will now see, except of the most rudimentary kind. An obvious consequence is that linguistic competence is a sine qua non for possession of a distinctively human architecture. 
But we've just argued that rationality precedes linguistic competence. How are we to reconcile this with the claims just made? And what is the nature of that pre- linguistic rationality? These questions are to be answered in terms of some general facts about language; and those facts about language are, in their turn, to be understood in terms of some points that we've already made but that we'd do well to make again, given that their bearing on the present topic of discussion may not be obvious. 
Rationality is personalized intelligence. It is intelligence that has been transferred from the subpersonal to the personal level of mentation. The nucleus of personal mentation is consciousness. The essence of consciousness being phenomenology, consciousness, to the extent that it is representational, represents through depictions: through pictures essentially, provided that the word "picture" is so broadened as to include not just visual, but also included auditory and otherwise sensory images.

one, it isn't the other. See Chapter 5, Section 5.0.) It is indeed by turning our thoughts into pictures that we enable ourselves to control and evaluate them; and it is indeed by associating our thoughts with expressions that we turn them into pictures. But it isn't by associating our thoughts with pictures that we verbalize them: it is by turning our thoughts into pictures of non-pictures, those non-pictures being expressions. So the truth that we pictorialize our thoughts by associating them with expressions must be distinguished from the falsehood, propounded by Wittgenstein, that we verbalize our thoughts by associating them with pictures. 
It isn't by virtue of making pictures available to them that languages enable people to express themselves. So far as a given language L provides a given person P with a way of expressing himself, it is because there is a function that assigns distinct L- expressions to content-distinct P-thoughts. Such a function must assign structurally distinct L-expressions to structurally distinct P-thoughts. A function that doesn't satisfy this condition is undefined except for thoughts whose exact contents have been satisfied, and thus fails to assign expressions to content-new thoughts. A function that does satisfy this condition is defined for content-new thoughts, so long as those thought-contents meet relatively non-constrictive, purely formal requirements. 
This is not to say that any existing language satisfies this condition, or even that any possible language could satisfy it. It is to say that a language is inadequate to the extent that it doesn't satisfy it, and adequate to the extent that it does.

Q A 
one's belief that it is hot outside becomes an object of one's consciousness. One can sense-perceive the aforementioned symbol-token and one can also sense-perceive the state of weather; and in light of the latter, one can evaluate the degree to which the occurrence of that token was in keeping with customs. That occurrence expresses a belief that one has, and is thus an externalization of that belief. So, by evaluating the custom-friendliness of the occurrence of that token, one is, in effect, evaluating the veridicality of a belief that one has. 
So even though beliefs per se are unobservable, their symbolic or proto-symbolic expressions are quite observable; and for that reason, beliefs become observable. And once they are observable, they are evaluable; for, whereas they were previously identical with awarenesses, they can now be objects of awareness. 
All beliefs are unobservable, as are all propositional attitudes, be they accessconscious or repressed. Following Freud (949), I conjecture that it is only because propositional attitudes become associated with expressions, and in due course with mental icons thereof, that they become observable. 
We must recall that consciousness consists of phenomenology, through and through; and propositional attitudes to no degree consist of phenomenology. It is only in so far as they are phenomenologized that propositional attitudes are introspectible. 
But not just any phenomenological expression of a given type of propositional attitude is recognizable to introspection as an expression of that particular type of

what is not immediately present. Therefore, one is not reacting to a situation so far as one's immediate response to it is to make a judgment. Thus, propositional attitudes 
are responses, 
not reactions. 
Affects, by contrast, are reactions, not responses. Changes in one's affective condition, and thus in one's phenomenology, are hewed to changes in one's immediate environment. Changes in one's propositional attitudes are not thus hewed. Changes of the one kind cannot possibly be in lockstep with changes of the other kind. Therefore, a given person's phenomenological condition leaves it open what his propositional attitudes are. 
One's affects are effects of one's propositional attitudes, and therefore aren't constitutive of them. Therefore, we cannot possibly have a priori knowledge as to how our affects correlate with our propositional attitudes, and, it obviously follows, so far as we have such knowledge, it is a posteriori, like our knowledge that smoke means fire. 
Throughout this book, we've argued that, contrary to what empiricists hold, affective reactions are cognitive. In light of this fact, the points just made must be qualified. (Those points would have been unintelligible if they had been duly qualified

3.3 Custom-driven behavior is not rule-governed behavior. The former therefore isn't true or false, or otherwise right or wrong, and it therefore isn't linguistic. Customdriven behavior gives way to rule-governed behavior when there come into existence customs that regulate pre-existing customs. Let's suppose that it's merely a matter of custom that you should wear a shirt when dining at a public eatery, i.e. that it isn't yet a matter of law. But let's suppose that it becomes a matter of custom, not law, that one cannot wear a shirt while eating pheasant-under-glass. What happens if somebody wearing a shirt is eating pheasant under glass at a public eatery? Clearly we have inconsistent customs on our hands. But let's say that it becomes a matter a matter of custom that, when there are two customs that cannot jointly be followed, the one with the smaller "impact-factor," i.e. the one that has the lesser effect on human behavior, is to be jettisoned. In that case, it becomes a logical consequence of our customs that somebody at public eatery who is eating pheasant under glass should wear a shirt. (Obviously more people eat at public eateries than eat pheasant-under- glass.) And in that case, if one chooses to comply with the higher-order custom (given two incompatible customs, abide by the one with the greater impact factor), it is logically, as opposed to emotionally or socially, incumbent on one to flout one custom and abide by another.

of logic. So far as one's reason for performing it is to please one's peers, one isn't following a rule. 
Logic-driven behavior may be driven by the objective, and may have the effect, of consolidating a social order on which people depend for their welfare. But oftentimes the logical connection between one's behavior and the welfare of one's peers is so recondite that one's behavior, though in fact advantageous to one's peers, is perceived by them as undermining and anti-social. 
4.0 The points just made about the social sphere hold of the linguistic sphere. It may be customary to say "x1" when it's hot, and "x2" when it's cold. Depending on whether one abides with those customs, one either pleases or displeases one's peers, but one hasn't spoken truly or falsely or otherwise behaved correctly or incorrectly. But this changes when meta-linguistic expressions come into existence. 227 A “meta- linguistic" expression is one that builds sentences out of other sentences. 
"Because" is such an expression, since, when given "Jim is wealthy" and "Jim is smart," it yields "Jim is wealthy because Jim is smart." "It is not the case that" is such an expression, since, when given "Jim is wealthy," it yields "it is not the case that Jim is wealthy." 
Meta-linguistic expressions are sometimes referred to as "connectives." But the latter term is misleading, since some so-called connectives, e.g. "it is not the case

The fact that "P or Q" is equivalent with "Q or P" is a fact of logic, not of semantics; and semantic rules must not, and generally do not, prejudge, issues of logic or any other semantics- transcendent domain. Cantor proved that, if x is a transfinite cardinal, then “1 + x” is larger than "x + 1." We thus want to say that "+" no less than "<" operates on ordered pairs of numbers, even though before Cantor's time, it may have seemed sheer pedantry to say this.

If S is the sentence "fear is a more powerful motivator than love" The fact that S means P is a logical consequence of the semantic rules for "fear," "love" and so on.

(ii*) they would thereby weaken the English language in some way: unambiguous expressions would become ambiguous; hitherto easily made points would become hard or impossible to make; etc. 
Some of my students have trouble seeing how those two sentences, or other comparably related sentences, differ in meaning. Ashamed of their lack of acumen, such students often go on to deny that those sentences have different meanings, and they justify their position by espousing meaning-conventionalism. "Those expressions cannot possibly have different meanings," they say. "Expressions mean what their users want them to mean. What an expression means cannot possibly be a mystery to the people who use it. Therefore, those sentences can't have meanings we don't know 
them to have."

somebody's part to know the meaning of a primitive semantic rule constitutes a lack of linguistic competence on his part. 
An expression is useless if we don't know its meaning. At the same time, an expression is useless if it is impossible for us not to know its meaning. In fact, there cannot be an expression as to whose meaning it is not possible for one to in error; for nothing assigns meaning to such an expression, as we saw a moment ago, and such an expression therefore cannot possibly exist, since an expression cannot possibly lack meaning, as we saw in Chapter 4, Sections 7.4-7.5.7. 
There are, or at least there theoretically could be, writers who use syntax so masterfully that, during their lifetimes, only a few savants know what they are saying. 229 Such writers are putting the resources of their respective languages to new and legitimate use; they are unearthing the hidden capabilities of those languages. And yet to their less enlightened contemporaries, those authors are producing "drivel." 
To conclude, it is when meta-customs come into existence that first-order customs become rules - and thus cease to be customs. (Let's set aside the technical point that the aforementioned "meta-customs" aren't really meta-customs if the socalled "customs" they govern are rules, not customs. It's a difficult, but unimportant, question how to restate the points just made so as to avoid the inconsistencies embodied in our use of the term "meta-custom.”)

There are communities all of whose members all speak English, Yiddish, and Hebrew, and each of whose members uses all three when speaking to his fellow community-members.

Let G be some group of people who don't already have a language; and let's suppose that the members of G all live in a naturally temperature-controlled cave. Members of G very much want to know what the weather is like outside. It becomes customary for members of G entering the cave to say "x1” “x2” or “x3” depending on whether it's hot, cold, or raining. And it is on the basis of these "reports" that members of G decide what sort of apparel to don before exiting the cave. 
One day, upon entering the cave, some prankster named "Smith" says "x1" even though, as he well knows, it's extremely cold. His cadres put on their summer gear, only to get frost-bite within seconds of exiting the cave. Has Smith spoken falsely? 
Smith has spoken falsely only if it is a rule that one must say "x1" when, and only when, it's hot outside. But is there such a rule? It is customary among members of G to use "x" in that way. But customs are not rules. A custom-breaker's peers may look at him askance; they may even kill him or they may see his behavior as endearingly eccentric. But however they react to him, their reaction will be emotionbased and ad 
hoc. 
Rules, by definition, are never implicit. They must either be stated explicitly, or (as with derivative semantic rules) they must be logical consequences of explicitly stated rules. Smith has acted misleadingly, but not falsely, for, although he has acted contrary to people's expectations, he hasn't broken any rule.

such as those associated with "n" and "c" how one used "x1" "x2" etc. was a matter of 
how one felt like using them. 
And so long as it was merely habitual of people to say "x1" when it was hot, their using that term when it was cold wasn't wrong, except in the weak sense in which telling off-color jokes at a wedding is wrong. Merely customary, as opposed to ruledriven, behavior isn't wrong. But deviations from customs become wrong, as opposed to merely emotionally disturbing, when the customs in question themselves come to be regulated by customs. 
Paradoxically, it is only when complex expressions come into existence that simple ones do as well. Strictly speaking, "x1" and "x2" were proto-expressions, not actual expression, since customs, as opposed to rules, determined how they were used. These proto-expressions became real expressions when, and only when, there came into existence higher-order symbols, such as “n” and “c”. For it isn't until higher-order expressions come into existence that proto-expressions are used in accordance with rules; and, since actual linguistic expressions are used in accordance with rules, it isn't until higher-order expressions come into existence that proto-expressions become real expressions. Higher-order expressions govern sentences. Since there are no genuine expressions until there are higher-order expressions, there are no atomic sentences until there are molecular sentences, and there are thus no subsentential expressions until there are sentences.

If (K) were correct, then, given an occurrence of "Smith is tall," the corresponding occurrences of "ith," "mi," and "all" would be proper parts of the occurrence of "Smith is tall." But they aren't; so K is false.

But this only proves our point; for were that to happen, it would be by virtue of its causal properties, not its location, that the Washington was a constituent of that trash-heap. 
6.0 Let us summarize this chapter's main points, and then identify some of the more important consequences of those points. The simple expressions of a language cannot be universally misunderstood. (More precisely, when they are universally misunderstood, language-shift necessarily occurs. This qualification is not a purely technical one: it compatibilizes the point just made with the points about to be made.) If everyone "misunderstands" the words "red" and "blue" taking the former to mean blue and the latter to mean red, then "red" and "blue" ipso facto mean, respectively, blue and red. But the complex expressions of a language can be misunderstood. But consider the sentence:

every member of c* to a member of c, it follows the class of real numbers is better populated than the class of integers, even though each class has infinitely many members. 
Moreover, in assigning P to AC, those semantic rules not only determine AC's meaning, but also its truth-value; for mathematical propositions are either non- circumstantially true (true in all circumstances) or non-circumstantially false. But one could grasp the semantics of terms such as "function," "class," "number," etc. without either knowing that AC has P for its meaning or a fortiori knowing whether AC is true. 
231, 232 
231. Incidentally, P is true. Cantor's famous "diagonal argument," whereby he proved that there are more reals than integers, presupposes the truth of the "axiom of choice" which is the contention that, for any class K of classes, there is a class that contains exactly one member of each member of K. 
232. There is another point that warrants inclusion in this book, but not in the main text. Let English* in which sentences could not be combined into compound sentences but was otherwise as much like English as possible. English* could contain the sentence "John is sick" and "John ate a rotten apple," but not "John is sick because John ate a rotten apple." So English* is expressively weaker than English; and the reason is that, unlike English, English* contains no metalinguistic devices no

expressions (or comparable entities, e.g. grammatically significant ways of ordering words or of inflecting one's voice) that token functors, viz. that turn simple expressions into complex ones and that turn complex ones into even more complex ones. All combinatory devices are meta-linguistic expressions. 
Be it noted that, if English* contains phonetically unrealized substitutes for "because" and for all other connective devices, then English* isn't expressively inferior to English in the requisite way. Suppose, for example, that, in English*, uttering “John ate a rotten apple" in a certain tone of voice, right after uttering "John is sick,” has the effect of producing an utterance whose meaning coincides with that of "John is sick because John at a rotten apple." 
Supposing this true, English* does comprise an analogue of "because," it being irrelevant that, in the one language but the other, that connective is acoustically realized. (The grammatical devices used by Latin speakers to express relations of direct and indirect objecthood, and also of instrumentality or manner the accusative, dative, and ablative case-endings, respectively - are accomplished in English through word-order. And, as Chomsky was the first, or one of the first, to make clear, we should let considerations of function, not of acoustics and orthography, determine what we believe about language. To be sure, sounds and inscriptions dazzle us, as do all perceptible entities, and imperceptible, or quasi-perceptible, entities such as word-

The dog doesn't reflexively respond to the sight of red meat in the way it instinctively responds to a lion running towards it.

And, to put forth an altogether new hypothesis, the logical canons embodied in personal mentation, once it becomes intelligent, coincide with those embodied in subpersonal mentation. To echo previous disclaimers, this is just a hypothesis - if, indeed, that contention isn't too speculative to be dignified with the term "hypothesis."

The altruist doesn't benefit from his own altruism (I am setting aside the comparatively few people - the Mother Teresa's and Martin Luther King's of this world - for whom altruism and self-interest coincide.) So his altruism has no value for him, and it has only instrumental value for the person who benefits from it. So the one thing that has intrinsic moral value is the consolidation and expansion of one's own agency, socio-ethical goodness being but an instrumental form of goodness.234 
234. Nietzsche advocated a similar view, and his arguments for it, so far as I can make them out, are similar to ours. I say this only to give credit where credit is due. Nietzsche advocated ethical egoism. He was one of the few who did so. Spinoza was another, and my arguments are no less Spizonan than they are Nietzschean. 
Given that ethical egoism is, by definition, an anti-social ethical system, Nietzsche's ethical views are reviled. But I agree with them and with his arguments for them, and I hope that I've helped make his ethical views seem less absurd than they are typically claimed to be. It is my duty as a scholar to state my biases and therefore to say how very much I admire the work of Nietzsche and Spinoza.

rationalization whose purpose isn't to facilitate the discharging of instincts that one's judgment, if uncorrupted, would suppress. But instinct-influenced, intention-driven behavior is not to be categorized with instinct-driven behavior. Intention-driven behavior is judgment-driven behavior. Instinct-driven behavior is urge-driven 
behavior. The latter is reflexive. The former is not. 
We often describe instances of the former as “reactive” “instinctual,” “thoughtless,” or "reflexive." But when we describe a given act in this way, what we're saying, if true, is that the judgment driving that act was precipitous and therefore made excessive, rationalization- or laziness-based provisions for the gratification of instincts that should have been gratified in some other, more circuitous way. 
"It was thoughtless of him to punch his dissertation-advisor," I heard it said of one individual: "it was an act of pure instinct.” No - it was a judgment-driven act, but the judgment in question was corrupted by self-indulgent, instinct-gratification- conducive rationalizations. The individual in question was later diagnosed as schizoaffective. But his act in the same category as your reading this sentence. Both acts were judgment-driven. The difference is that the one judgment, but not the other,

thwart one's ability to process information. These points will be clarified and developed in Section 7.2 of the present chapter. 
Whether a person becomes schizoaffective as opposed to obsessive-compulsive, or vice versa, may be a function of his brain-structure. But that does not necessarily mean that either disorder is organic. It could mean that a non-psychological factor determines the way in which disturbances in one's object-relations, self-concept, etc. become pathologized. 
OCD is most definitely to be understood in psychodynamic terms. 236 Of course, it has physiological underpinnings - but so does one's belief that there are no regular 17-sided polygons. Schizoaffective disorder may have a larger purely somatic component than OCD. But soon after a person becomes schizoaffective, his pre- existing internal conflicts and object-relations come to be heavily implicated in his symptomology. So even if the basis of schizoaffective disorder is purely organic, distinctively schizoaffective ideation can and must be understood in psychodynamic 
terms. 
235. Donald Davidson (1981b) makes this point clearly and forcefully. 
236. See Reich (1945), Stekel (1949), Freud (1963), Kernberg (1985, 1993), and Salzman (1994). OCD was extremely well understood by the theoreticians of the Freudian school. Contemporary work on it is dismal. (Salzman's work is spot-on. But

Brain-damage and organic brain-disorders lead to delusive and otherwise misguided ideation. But such ideation, unlike the schizophrenic's, is not to be understood in psychodynamic terms. For the damage to one's psyche done by brain- damage and brain-disorders is a consequence of interruptions of mental activity. Distinct mental processes are not allowed to converge, and different parts of the mind are therefore unable to exchange information. Distinct mental faculties are under- interrelated. In the psychotic, they are over-interrelated. There is excessive psychological ferment; whence the anarchical quality of the psychotic's mentation. The mentation of somebody with Alzheimer's is pseudo-anarchical. The problem isn't that the corridors within which normal thought occurs are too full and therefore can't accomodate the high-volume of cognitive traffic: it is that those corridors aren't full enough. The erratic nature of the psychotic's mentation is a consequence of mental processes' interrupting, and corrupting, other mental processes. The erratic nature of the Alzheimer's patient's mentation is a consequence of his mental processes petering out before they so much as have a chance to converge with other such processes. So any given case of psychosis is to be understood in psychological terms, even if it was initiated by a purely organic disturbance and even it is being sustained by such a disturbance. This is because it is by virtue of having over-interrelated mental states

Being human, in the psychological sense of the word, consists in: 
(i) having agency 
(ii) valuing the fortification of one's agency. 
There is a tight connection between intellect and agency. (As previously stated, or implied, Aristotle (350 BC) and Kant ( 785) held that agency is applied intellect. The present author agrees with them.) Consider the case of a brilliant person who lets his mind atrophy, so that he becomes a dullard whose intellect can no longer grow and is stocked with nothing but clichés and insights generated by his previous self.

238. I've heard it said that intellectuals are at their peak in their late 20's and early 30's. I've also heard it said that, if a given intellectual diligently cultivates his mind during those years, he can continue to grow as a thinker. These contentions may seem opposed to each other. 
But I think they're both true. I know people who where geniuses in early adulthood but who, because they didn't develop their gifts, stopped being geniuses. And I've known 80 year olds who were still geniuses and who did (from what I can determine from their publication records) vigorously cultivate their minds during early adulthood. I've never known anyone who was a genius as a youth but, without doing everything he could to develop his intellect, remained a genius or even went on to be more than a middling thinker. 
Smith has conflicting values. Both values are legitimate. But Smith must renounce one of them. Smith is conflicted. Internal conflict is essential to the human condition, or at the very least it is a virtually inevitable result of having a distinctively human psychological architecture. 
In order to move forward, we must note that there are two ways in which a person can be conflicted: 
< 
347-348/476 
Empiricism and the Foundations of Psychology 
(i) He may have two conflicting values. 
Q A 
(ii) He may have a value that conflicts with a desire that does not correspond to any value of his. 
Smith's situation is an illustration of (i). Smith accepts that he is in a lose-lose 
situation. 
This does not mean that he is happy about it. Nor does it mean that he, while accepting it in some purely intellectual sense, some part of him is holding on to the obvious fiction that not all the paths available to him involve a forfeiture of an important part of himself. Type-(i) conflict leads to repression and rationalization only if one turns a blind eye to the ugliness of one's situation. If one doesn't do so, type-(i) conflict leads to garden-variety unhappiness. Freud said that the purpose of psychoanalytic therapy was "to turn neurotic unhappiness into non-neurotic unhappiness." Smith is unhappy in a non-neurotic way. 
But type-(i) conflict can lead to growth. An illustration: Brown is a creditable athlete: with the right training, he could be a professional athlete, albeit a decidedly mediocre one. But there is nothing mediocre about Brown's musicianship: he is a genius; he has the potential to be truly great composer. But he is currently a mediocre composer, because he spends as much time playing tennis as he does composing. Brown is aware of this; and even though he rightly values both sports and music, he

stalled out. Not because he's lost his creative fire, but because he's become a heroin addict; and shooting heroin is easy, whereas writing books is insidiously difficult. Jones' heroin addiction is incompatible with his aspiration of becoming a great writer.240 
239. I am setting aside infants, victims of brain-damage, etc. Importantly, no psychodynamic conflict of any kind ever occurs in the mind of a psychopath or a sociopath. This is because such people don't value anything - though they have desires that mimic values - and a fortiori don't have conflicting values and therefore aren't conflicted. Psychopaths and sociopaths are not psychodynamic. Obviously they have minds; and those minds are teeming with activity. But emotional conflict is no part of their psychological integration, which is an exceedingly crude one, as we'll discuss in Chapter 16. Criminality is different from sociopathy and from psychopathy. Criminals may have values; they may have a fully developed psychological architecture. This too will be discussed in Chapter 16. 
240. I do not know whether heroin-addiction actually does have this affect on one's literary or otherwise professional aspirations. I do know that many a great thinker and writer has taken to using morphine at certain points in his life. There have been sometime opium-eaters who did good work while using morphine or other opiates. I have read that the Viet Cong, after performing Herculean feats of military prowess

chose to be a junky. My sense of self-worth was largely dependent on the quality of my literary output. The quality and quantity of that output is now about to plummet. But I'm going to do heroin anyway, because I like doing it, souldestroying though it is. Not likely. If Jones saw his situation with such clarity, he would probably not be so cavalier about choosing to do heroin. And if he chose to use heroin, despite his high level of self-awareness, his usage of it would probably not become a permanent part of his life - unless he became deeply entrenched in his own rationalizations. 
Jones doesn't tell himself: "I'm lazy. I'm a lazy junkie. I'm a failure. I couldn't hack it." No - drawing on the very skills that would have made him a great writer, he tells himself the following: 
(JR242) I have always admired Tolstoy and Dostoevsky for their obvious mastery of their craft. And, undoubtedly, that craft is in many respects a valuable one. It is valuable in much the way a musical compositions is valuable, or intricate patterned Persian rug. But it isn't practical. It doesn't put food in anyone's mouth (except mine and my editor's). In fact, it takes food off of the common man's table, and it does so in two different ways.

illusion of knowledge weakens his sense of guilt and therefore weakens his urge to donate money to his needy brothers and sisters. 
Further, this Steinbeck-reader comes to find that, in his own life, there are many analogues of the injustices experienced by the misfortunates Steinbeck so expertly describes. He has experienced many slights over the years: from jealous editors, who knew that, whereas his work had merit, theirs had none; from equally jealous teachers who, wanting him to dissipate his gifts instead of cultivating them, tried to convince him that it was his moral duty to work for the sanitation department; from the committee that gave the college literary prize, not to him, but to the attractive young woman who happened to be dating the committee-chair, for her chic and empty, pseudo-heartfelt, pseudoSteinbeckian descriptions of the travails of her chamber- maid, her butler, her chauffeur, her grounds-keeper, and her various cleaning- personnel. 
Given an arbitrary Steinbeck-reader, reading Steinbeck hasn't made that person ashamed of his wealth, we have seen, and it hasn't made him want to help the poor. On the contrary, it has made him think that he's experienced what they've experienced and that he therefore deserves every bit of comfort and luxury of which he can avail himself "There are different forms of suffering," he tells himself. "My shackles are made of gold; theirs of wrought iron. But shackles are shackles, are they

He also knows that, in buying heroin, he's providing economic support for drug kingpins and, for that reason, for people who, to a larger degree than the members of any other group, are responsible for the wretched conditions obtaining in poor, urban neighborhoods. 
But Jones conveniently forgets all that. And by repeating JR to himself, as though it were a religious mantra, he retains the solace afforded him by his lies and his convenient lapses in memory. 
"But how can anyone make themselves believe something they don't?" That is a good question, which we will now answer. 
6.0 Rationalizing is not the same thing as lying. To lie is to intentionally misrepresent the truth to another person. To rationalize is to suppress one's own knowledge of some truth and to choose to replace it with a belief that one knows to be false (or, if true, is so only by accident) but is more comforting than its predecessor.

Rationalizing involves two things:

But that doesn't matter, because the essence of rationalization is decontextualization. The very purpose of rationalizing is to isolate bodies of information that, if allowed to commingle, will lead to an awareness of the very thing one doesn't want to know. If the rationalizer doesn't take things out of context and view them as narrowly as possible, he'll be either be forced to draw unwelcome conclusions from the data that he already has or he'll put himself in situations where the data is rationalization-proof.

He could fill in the bassoon-part (etc.) in the standard, conservatory-approved manner. But for him, the act of orchestrating a tune becomes another opportunity to do something new and important. Unlike his less gifted peers, the genius cannot phone it in; there are fewer junctures for him, than for his peers, at which he can simply apply an existing formula.

An unhappy person feels good when she's high on heroin, but she doesn't stop being unhappy. Being happy involves having a tendency to feel good. But not all good feelings are happiness-based. Happiness-based good feelings are those that embody a judgment on one's part to the effect that one's life conforms to the desiderata to which, in judgment, it should conform.

attempt to prove that shooting heroin is a better way to live than writing great novels. That point is obviously false; and that's what makes it obvious, so far as it is obvious, that the argument in JR is defective. But if we didn't know ex parte that JR's conclusion was false, it wouldn't be obvious at all that there was anything wrong with JR itself. 
A story will help make this clear. Gloxo is a hyper-intelligent extraterrestrial. He is a master of assimilating, producing, and dissecting arguments. Gloxo knows nothing about human beings: he knows nothing about their history, their practices, their values, or their psychology. He is asked (it doesn't matter by whom) to evaluate the argument in JR. 
Will Gloxo be able to find fault with that argument? It may be that, relative to beings whose cultural and economic circumstances differ but slightly from ours, the argument in JR is cogent or readily modified so as to become cogent. We know that JR leads to a false conclusion and must therefore contain an error. But we have inside 
information about our species; Gloxo does not, and he must therefore evaluate JR on its own terms. Thus evaluated, JR is not a particularly bad line of reasoning, and Gloxo, we may reasonably suppose, deems it cogent.

This isn't because there are two classes of inhibitory mechanisms: the emotional kind and the epistemic kind. It's because the first class is a proper subset of the second. Pain-avoidance is a kind of information-management. Your spouse is cheating on you. You know this. This knowledge is painful; so you repress it. For some reason or other, it makes its way back into your consciousness. You experience pain. The pain represents information-overload. Taken by itself, your knowledge of your spouse's behavior couldn't possibly lead to information-overload; the person your spouse is carrying on with knows about her infidelities and his consciousness obviously isn't overloaded because of it. But that information has consequences for you that it doesn't have for him. That's why you're overwhelmed and he isn't. It isn't your knowledge of your wife's infidelities that overwhelms you; it's your knowledge of the consequences of that knowledge. Your wife is a person of considerable merit.

Purely organic disorders, such as are associated with brain damage or Alzheimer's, may bring about psychosis-like conditions. But whereas psychosis, whatever its organic underpinnings may be, is a psychological illness, whose symptoms can be understood in psychological terms (as derivatives of wishes, beliefs, etc.), the psychological disruptions that accompany a purely organic disorder are not to be understood in this way. A consequence is that they are not ameliorated by eliminating intrapsychic conflicts or otherwise deepening the patient's insight into himself.

The reason they surface during sleep is that the maturation-based inhibitions that keep such creatures in the basement of the psyche, where they belong, have been relaxed, liberating these bottom-dwellers from the musty confines of the unconscious, letting them roam around the higher strata of consciousness. The reason why one often feels paralyzed in one's dreams is that the channels that convert one's waking thoughts into overt behaviors have been shut off.

Purely organic disorders, such as are associated with brain damage or Alzheimer's, may bring about psychosis-like conditions. But whereas psychosis, whatever its organic underpinnings may be, is a psychological illness, whose symptoms can be understood in psychological terms (as derivatives of wishes, beliefs, etc.), the psychological disruptions that accompany a purely organic disorder are not to be understood in this way. A consequence is that they are not ameliorated by eliminating intrapsychic conflicts or otherwise deepening the patient's insight into himself. 
7.1 Neurotic people see external reality as it is. It is their own feelings to which they are blind. Put more precisely: in so far as a person is neurotic, and not also psychotic or otherwise psychologically impaired, he sees the external world for what it is, his blindness being to his own feelings, not to external reality.

directly that the other can know only indirectly (through inference). But that doesn't mean that there is anything about the external world that the one can know that the other cannot. It means that, given either one of those two creatures, there is something about the internal world that the one can know that the other cannot. Given some plant P, there are facts about P's microstructure that Smith can know directly that Brown can know only indirectly. What follows isn't that Smith can have P-related knowledge that Smith cannot, but rather that Smith can have P-awareness- related knowledge that Smith cannot. What follows, therefore, is that there is some psychological truth that Smith can know that Brown cannot know, not that that there is some non-psychological truth that Smith can know that Brown cannot know. 
There are some experiences the likes of which a person doesn't have unless he is mentally ill. Such experiences bear otherwise unobtainable information about the disfigurements of one's psychological structure that constitute psychopathology; and that information, in its turn, bears otherwise unobtainable information about the structure of the psyche. 
A person's mind must be distinguished from the activity that it mediates. Let Smith be some person who is cryogenically frozen at time t, and let B be Smith's body. At time t*, B is unfrozen and reactivated. The mental activity mediated by postfreeze B's brain bears the same relationship to the activity mediated by pre-freeze B's brain that your Tuesday-morning (post-sleep) mental activity bears with respect to your

We will justify this point in Chapters 14 and 15.) Such disfigurements are necesssarily performance-diminishing. As a result, what the non-disfigured mind does automatically, its disfigured counterpart either doesn't do or does consciously, this being why, in those afflicted by psychopathology, UMA and CMA coalesce. 
Non-obsessive-compulsive Parker doesn't want to visit his in-laws. But he feels that he has a moral obligation to visit them; and he does so, believing that he is thereby fulfilling a moral obligation that he could just as well have decided not to fulfill. Given how poorly Parker's in-laws treat him, it's obvious that Parker does not have any moral obligation to visit them, suggesting that his conscious belief to the contrary is not the real force behind his decision to visit his in-laws. 
Like Parker, obsessive-compulsive Johnson doesn't want to visit his in-laws. Unlike Parker, Johnson does not believe that he has a moral obligation to visit them. But because of his condition, he feels compelled to visit them – that is, he has an ego- dystonic compulsion to do so and he gives into this compulsion. Parker's reason his actual reason for visiting his in-laws is no more irrational than Johnson's. It is only because Johnson was conscious of the irrational force behind his behavior that we 
describe it as "compulsive," and it is only because Parker is unconscious of the corresponding force that we describe his behavior as "non-compulsive.” Like Parker, Johnson has to rationalize his compulsion in some way. But Johnson must consciously construct that rationalization; Parker's mind automatically and

Q A 
By virtue of having such delusions Brown knows much about the psyche that he would not otherwise know (setting aside the obvious fact that knows what it is like to have such a delusion). First of all, Brown is never completely insane. During his worst moments, he is only relatively so; and sometimes he is lucid. And to the extent that Brown's ideation is psychotic, it isn't because he has undergone a complete cognitive regression; it isn't because his thinking has become exactly like an infants. It is because, while still thinking like an adult, he also thinks like an infant. Infants aren't psychotic, and neither are dreamers. The reason: in such people, infantile thought doesn't commingle with non-infantile thought. Brown is psychotic. The reason: in him, infantile thought does commingle with non-infantile thought. It isn't solely because Brown has regressed that his condition is morbid. Were Brown's psyche to undergo wholesale infantalization, he'd obviously be the worse for it: he would be less functional and less intelligent. But his condition wouldn't be morbid at least not in the way in which, in actuality, it is morbid. His condition is morbid because part of him has regressed and part of him hasn't. 
But such a partial regression wouldn't necessarily be morbid: a person who was sometimes an adult and sometimes a baby would be a source of amusement, but his condition, though substandard, wouldn't be morbid, at least not in the same way as a psychotic's. So far as the psychotic's condition is morbid, it is because, in him,
