OK. THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE LOGIC OF THIS APP. HERE IS WHAT HAPENS. LET'S SAY THE USER ASKS (E.G.) FREUD A QUESTION. THE APP DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION AS FREUD WOULD; IN FACT, IT DOES NOT EVEN ANSWER THE QUESTION AS AN IDEALIZED VERSION OF FREUD WOULD. RATHER, IT GIVES SOME CHICKENSHIT ANSWER THAT REPRESENTS THE CURRENT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE. I ASKED THE FREUD BOT THE FOLLOWING: How can psychoanalytic theory be falsifiable when resistance to interpretation is itself interpreted as confirmation of the unconscious content being resisted? ITS ANSWER: From the psychoanalytic standpoint, resistance encountered during analysis is indeed perceived as an indication of significant unconscious material. This might raise the question of falsifiability in psychoanalytic theory. However, it is important to consider that psychoanalysis is not strictly a natural science but rather a hermeneutic discipline aimed at interpreting the human psyche's dynamics. When resistance is observed, it suggests, not confirms, the presence of repressed content, inviting further exploration rather than providing a conclusive proof. Thus, the focus is on understanding the underlying psychic conflicts and the meanings attributed to them by the individual, rather than on empirical verification in the conventional sense.

— "Whenever we try to penetrate to the hidden unconscious, starting out from the substitute which the dream element represents, we meet with resistance." (A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis) THIS IS 100% NOT WHAT HE WOULD SAY; AND IT IS 100% WHAT SOMEBODY WHO REJECTED PSYCHOANALYSIS WOULD SAY. IT IS A SHIT ANSWER, BECAUSE IT IS NOT FREUD'S ANSWER; IT IS THE 'CONVENTIONAL WISDOM' ANSWER. HERE IS A MORE LIKELY ANSWER: RESISTANCE IS NOT DENIAL. IF I SAY 2+2=5 AND YOU DISAGREE, THAT IS DISAGREEM/DENIAL. NOT RESISTANCE. BUT IF, AFTER LISTENING TO YOU TALK ABOUT HOW EVIL YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS, I SAY: MAYBE YOU DON'T LIKE HER; AND YOU LASH OUT...WELL, THAT' S DIFFERENT, BECAUSE YOUR STATEMENT CONTRADICTS A MILLION OTHER STATEMENTS YOU GAVE ME. SO HERE IS WHAT YOU DO. WHEN YOU SEND THE QUESTION TO THE LLM (ALONG WITH THE RELEVANT PARAGRAPHS YOU FIND), YOU SAY: ANSWER AS THE AUTHOR WOULD (IN TERMS OF CONTENT, NOT SO MUCH IN TERMS OF STYKLE); IF NECESSARY, ASNWER AS AN IDEALIZED VERSION OF THE AUTHOR (IE. SAME MINDSET BUT UPDATED WITH MODERN KNOWLELDGE/TECHNIQUES). BUT DO NOT GIVE SOME ANSWER THAT IS ANTITHETICAL TO, OR ALIEN FROM, HIS VIEWS AND JUST PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH.
