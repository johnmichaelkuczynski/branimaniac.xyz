273. Laws coordinate behavior for mutual protection.
274. Coordination is a moral function.
275. Coordination requires reliability.

312. A system that protects rights generates legal obligations.
313. Typical legal systems protect most of a citizen's rights.
314. Legal systems often prevent murder, enslavement, and dehumanization.

328. Driving 66 mph does not harm anyone the government protects.
329. Legal obligation does not reduce to protecting beneficiaries.
330. Failing to drive 65 mph does not necessarily erode governmental authority.

=== RECOGNITION AS TECHNICAL CONCEPT ===

331. Obligations to uphold government authority cannot explain legal obligation.
332. Legal obligation differs from obligation to avoid erosion of authority.
333. Recognition by a legal system is not mere acknowledgment of existence.
334. Recognition is a technical term involving standing.

338. Without standing, there is no legal obligation.
339. Legal recognition is logically tied to protection.
340. A law that orders evil toward Smith does not constitute legal protection.

341. Such a system does not protect Smith and therefore does not recognize him.
342. Legal recognition requires conferral of protections even if the system mentions the person.
343. Stalinist denunciation laws produce legal obligations despite their wickedness.
