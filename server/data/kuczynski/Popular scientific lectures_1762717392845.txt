AUTHOR'S 
PREFACE 
TO 
THE 
FIRST 
EDITION. 


Popular 
lectures, 
owing 
to 
the 
knowledge 
they 
presuppose, 
and 
the 
time 
they 
occupy, 
can 
afford 
only 
a 
modicum 
of 
instruction. 
They 
must 
select 
for 
this 
purpose 
easy 
subjects, 
and 
restrict 
themselves 
to 
the 
exposition 
of 
the 
simplest 
and 
the 
most 
essential 
points. 
Nevertheless, 
by 
an 
appropriate 
choice 
of 
the 
matter, 
the 
charm 
and 
the 
poetry 
of 
research 
can 
be 
conveyed 
by 
them. 
It 
is 
only 
necessary 
to 
set 
forth 
the 
attractive 
and 
the 
alluring 
features 
of 
a 
problem, 
and 
to 
show 
what 
broad 
domains 
of 
fact 
can 
be 
illuminated 
by 
the 
light 
radiating 
from 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
single 
and 
ofttimes 
unobtrusive 
point. 


Furthermore, 
such 
lectures 
can 
exercise 
a 
favorable 
influence 
by 
showing 
the 
substantial 
sameness 
of 
scientific 
and 
every-day 
thought. 
The 
public, 
in 
this 
way, 
loses 
its 
shyness 
towards 
scientific 
questions, 
and 
acquires 
an 
interest 
in 
scientific 
work 
which 
is 
a 
great 
help 
to 
the 
inquirer. 
The 
latter, 
in 
his 
turn, 
is 
brought 
to 
understand 
that 
his 
work 
is 
a 
small 
part 
only 
of 
the 
universal 
process 
of 
life, 
and 
that 
the 
results 
of 
his 
labors 
must 
redound 
to 
the 
benefit 
not 
only 
of 
himself 
and 
a 
few 
of 
his 
associates, 
but 
to 
that 
of 
the 
collective 
whole. 


I 
sincerely 
hope 
that 
these 
lectures, 
in 
the 
present 
excellent 
translation, 
will 
be 
productive 
of 
good 
in 
the 
direction 
indicated.

TRANSLATOR'S 
NOTE 
TO 
THE 
THIRD 
EDITION. 


The 
present 
third 
edition 
of 
this 
work 
has 
been 
enlarged 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
new 
lecture, 
"On 
Some 
Phenomena 
Attending 
the 
Flight 
of 
Projectiles." 
The 
additions 
to 
the 
second 
consisted 
of 
the 
following 
four 
lectures 
and 
articles: 
Professor 
Mach's 
Vienna 
Inaugural 
Lecture, 
"The 
Part 
Played 
by 
Accident 
in 
Invention 
and 
Discovery," 
the 
lecture 
on 
"Sensations 
of 
Orientation," 
recently 
delivered 
and 
summing 
up 
the 
results 
of 
an 
important 
psychological 
investigation, 
and 
two 
historical 
articles 
(see 
Appendix) 
on 
Acoustics 
and 
Sight. 


The 
lectures 
extend 
over 
a 
long 
period, 
from 
1864 
to 
1898, 
and 
differ 
greatly 
in 
style, 
contents, 
and 
purpose. 
They 
were 
first 
published 
in 
collected 
form 
in 
English; 
afterwards 
two 
German 
editions 
were 
called 
for. 


As 
the 
dates 
of 
the 
first 
five 
lectures 
are 
not 
given 
in 
the 
footnotes 
they 
are 
here 
appended. 
The 
first 
lecture, 
"On 
the 
Forms 
of 
Liquids," 
was 
delivered 
in 
1868 
and 
published 
with 
that 
"On 
Symmetry" 
in 
1872 
(Prague). 
The 
second 
and 
third 
lectures, 
on 
acoustics, 
were 
first 
published 
in 
1865 
(Graz); 
the 
fourth 
and 
fifth, 
on 
optics, 
in 
1867 
(Graz). 
They 
belong 
to 
the 
earliest 
period 
of 
Professor 
Mach's 
scientific 
activity, 
and 
with 
the 
lectures 
on 
electrostatics 
and 
education 
will 
more 
than 
realise 
the 
hope 
expressed 
in 
the 
author's 
Preface. 


The 
eighth, 
ninth, 
tenth, 
eleventh, 
and 
twelfth 
lectures 
are 
of 
a 
more 
philosophical 
character 
and 
deal 
principally 
with 
the 
methods 
and 
nature 
of 
scientific 
inquiry. 
In 
the 
ideas 
summarised 
in 
them 
will 
be 
found 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
contributions 
to 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge 
made 
in 
the 
last 
quarter 
of 
a 
century. 
Significant 
hints 
in 
psychological 
method, 
and 
exemplary 
specimen-researches 
in 
psychology 
and 
physics, 
are 
also 
presented; 
while 
in 
physics 
many 
ideas 
find 
their 
first 
discussion 
that 
afterwards, 
under 
other 
names 
and 
other 
authorship, 
became 
rallying-cries 
in 
this 
department 
of 
inquiry. 



All 
the 
proofs 
of 
this 
translation 
have 
been 
read 
by 
Professor 
Mach 
himself.

THE 
FORMS 
OF 
LIQUIDS. 


What 
thinkest 
thou, 
dear 
Euthyphron, 
that 
the 
holy 
is, 
and 
the 
just, 
and 
the 
good? 
Is 
the 
holy 
holy 
because 
the 
gods 
love 
it, 
or 
are 
the 
gods 
holy 
because 
they 
love 
the 
holy? 
By 
such 
easy 
questions 
did 
the 
wise 
Socrates 
make 
the 
market-place 
of 
Athens 
unsafe 
and 
relieve 
presumptuous 
young 
statesmen 
of 
the 
burden 
of 
imaginary 
knowledge, 
by 
showing 
them 
how 
confused, 
unclear, 
and 
self-contradictory 
their 
ideas 
were. 


You 
know 
the 
fate 
of 
the 
importunate 
questioner. 
So 
called 
good 
society 
avoided 
him 
on 
the 
promenade. 
Only 
the 
ignorant 
accompanied 
him. 
And 
finally 
he 
drank 
the 
cup 
of 
hemlock—a 
lot 
which 
we 
ofttimes 
wish 
would 
fall 
to 
modern 
critics 
of 
his 
stamp. 


What 
we 
have 
learned 
from 
Socrates, 
however,—our 
inheritance 
from 
him, 
—is 
scientific 
criticism. 
Every 
one 
who 
busies 
himself 
with 
science 
recognises 
how 
unsettled 
and 
indefinite 
the 
notions 
are 
which 
he 
has 
brought 
with 
him 
from 
common 
life, 
and 
how, 
on 
a 
minute 
examination 
of 
things, 
old 
differences 
are 
effaced 
and 
new 
ones 
introduced. 
The 
history 
of 
science 
is 
full 
of 
examples 
of 
this 
constant 
change, 
development, 
and 
clarification 
of 
ideas. 


But 
we 
will 
not 
linger 
by 
this 
general 
consideration 
of 
the 
fluctuating 
character 
of 
ideas, 
which 
becomes 
a 
source 
of 
real 
uncomfortableness, 
when 
we 
reflect 
that 
it 
applies 
to 
almost 
every 
notion 
of 
life. 
Rather 
shall 
we 
observe 
by 
the 
study 
of 
a 
physical 
example 
how 
much 
a 
thing 
changes 
when 
it 
is 
closely 
examined, 
and 
how 
it 
assumes, 
when 
thus 
considered, 
increasing 
definiteness 
of 
form. 


The 
majority 
of 
you 
think, 
perhaps, 
you 
know 
quite 
well 
the 
distinction 
between 
a 
liquid 
and 
a 
solid. 
And 
precisely 
persons 
who 
have 
never 
busied 
themselves 
with 
physics 
will 
consider 
this 
question 
one 
of 
the 
easiest 
that 
can 
be 
put. 
But 
the 
physicist 
knows 
that 
it 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
difficult. 
I 
shall 
mention 
here 
only 
the 
experiments 
of 
Tresca, 
which 
show 
that 
solids 
subjected 
to 
high 
pressures 
behave 
exactly 
as 
liquids 
do; 
for 
example, 
may 
be 



made 
to 
flow 
out 
in 
the 
form 
of 
jets 
from 
orifices 
in 
the 
bottoms 
of 
vessels. 
The 
supposed 
difference 
of 
kind 
between 
liquids 
and 
solids 
is 
thus 
shown 
to 
be 
a 
mere 
difference 
of 
degree. 


The 
common 
inference 
that 
because 
the 
earth 
is 
oblate 
in 
form, 
it 
was 
originally 
fluid, 
is 
an 
error, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
these 
facts. 
True, 
a 
rotating 
sphere, 
a 
few 
inches 
in 
diameter 
will 
assume 
an 
oblate 
form 
only 
if 
it 
is 
very 
soft, 
for 
example, 
is 
composed 
of 
freshly 
kneaded 
clay 
or 
some 
viscous 
stuff. 
But 
the 
earth, 
even 
if 
it 
consisted 
of 
the 
rigidest 
stone, 
could 
not 
help 
being 
crushed 
by 
its 
tremendous 
weight, 
and 
must 
perforce 
behave 
as 
a 
fluid. 
Even 
our 
mountains 
could 
not 
extend 
beyond 
a 
certain 
height 
without 
crumbling. 
The 
earth 
may 
once 
have 
been 
fluid, 
but 
this 
by 
no 
means 
follows 
from 
its 
oblateness. 


The 
particles 
of 
a 
liquid 
are 
displaced 
on 
the 
application 
of 
the 
slightest 
pressure; 
a 
liquid 
conforms 
exactly 
to 
the 
shapes 
of 
the 
vessels 
in 
which 
it 
is 
contained; 
it 
possesses 
no 
form 
of 
its 
own, 
as 
you 
have 
all 
learned 
in 
the 
schools. 
Accommodating 
itself 
in 
the 
most 
trifling 
respects 
to 
the 
conditions 
of 
the 
vessel 
in 
which 
it 
is 
placed, 
and 
showing, 
even 
on 
its 
surface, 
where 
one 
would 
suppose 
it 
had 
the 
freest 
play, 
nothing 
but 
a 
polished, 
smiling, 
expressionless 
countenance, 
it 
is 
the 
courtier 
par 
excellence 
of 
the 
natural 
bodies. 


Liquids 
have 
no 
form 
of 
their 
own! 
No, 
not 
for 
the 
superficial 
observer. 
But 
persons 
who 
have 
observed 
that 
a 
raindrop 
is 
round 
and 
never 
angular, 
will 
not 
be 
disposed 
to 
accept 
this 
dogma 
so 
unconditionally. 


It 
is 
fair 
to 
suppose 
that 
every 
man, 
even 
the 
weakest, 
would 
possess 
a 
character, 
if 
it 
were 
not 
too 
difficult 
in 
this 
world 
to 
keep 
it. 
So, 
too, 
we 
must 
suppose 
that 
liquids 
would 
possess 
forms 
of 
their 
own, 
if 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
circumstances 
permitted 
it,—if 
they 
were 
not 
crushed 
by 
their 
own 
weights. 


An 
astronomer 
once 
calculated 
that 
human 
beings 
could 
not 
exist 
on 
the 
sun, 
apart 
from 
its 
great 
heat, 
because 
they 
would 
be 
crushed 
to 
pieces 
there 
by 
their 
own 
weight. 
The 
greater 
mass 
of 
this 
body 
would 
also 
make 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
human 
body 
there 
much 
greater. 
But 
on 
the 
moon, 
because 
here 
we 
should 
be 
much 
lighter, 
we 
could 
jump 
as 
high 
as 
the 
church-steeples 
without 
any 
difficulty, 
with 
the 
same 
muscular 
power 
which 
we 
now 
possess. 
Statues 



and 
"plaster" 
casts 
of 
syrup 
are 
undoubtedly 
things 
of 
fancy, 
even 
on 
the 
moon, 
but 
maple-syrup 
would 
flow 
so 
slowly 
there 
that 
we 
could 
easily 
build 
a 
maple-syrup 
man 
on 
the 
moon, 
for 
the 
fun 
of 
the 
thing, 
just 
as 
our 
children 
here 
build 
snow-men. 


Accordingly, 
if 
liquids 
have 
no 
form 
of 
their 
own 
with 
us 
on 
earth, 
they 
have, 
perhaps, 
a 
form 
of 
their 
own 
on 
the 
moon, 
or 
on 
some 
smaller 
and 
lighter 
heavenly 
body. 
The 
problem, 
then, 
simply 
is 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
gravity; 
and, 
this 
done, 
we 
shall 
be 
able 
to 
find 
out 
what 
the 
peculiar 
forms 
of 
liquids 
are. 


The 
problem 
was 
solved 
by 
Plateau 
of 
Ghent, 
whose 
method 
was 
to 
immerse 
the 
liquid 
in 
another 
of 
the 
same 
specific 
gravity. 
[1] 
He 
employed 
for 
his 
experiments 
oil 
and 
a 
mixture 
of 
alcohol 
and 
water. 
By 
Archimedes's 
well-
known 
principle, 
the 
oil 
in 
this 
mixture 
loses 
its 
entire 
weight. 
It 
no 
longer 
sinks 
beneath 
its 
weight; 
its 
formative 
forces, 
be 
they 
ever 
so 
weak, 
are 
now 
in 
full 
play. 


As 
a 
fact, 
we 
now 
see, 
to 
our 
surprise, 
that 
the 
oil, 
instead 
of 
spreading 
out 
into 
a 
layer, 
or 
lying 
in 
a 
formless 
mass, 
assumes 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
beautiful 
and 
perfect 
sphere, 
freely 
suspended 
in 
the 
mixture, 
as 
the 
moon 
is 
in 
space. 
We 
can 
construct 
in 
this 
way 
a 
sphere 
of 
oil 
several 
inches 
in 
diameter. 


If, 
now, 
we 
affix 
a 
thin 
plate 
to 
a 
wire 
and 
insert 
the 
plate 
in 
the 
oil 
sphere, 
we 
can, 
by 
twisting 
the 
wire 
between 
our 
fingers, 
set 
the 
whole 
ball 
in 
rotation. 
Doing 
this, 
the 
ball 
assumes 
an 
oblate 
shape, 
and 
we 
can, 
if 
we 
are 
skilful 
enough, 
separate 
by 
such 
rotation 
a 
ring 
from 
the 
ball, 
like 
that 
which 
surrounds 
Saturn. 
This 
ring 
is 
finally 
rent 
asunder, 
and, 
breaking 
up 
into 
a 
number 
of 
smaller 
balls, 
exhibits 
to 
us 
a 
kind 
of 
model 
of 
the 
origin 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
according 
to 
the 
hypothesis 
of 
Kant 
and 
Laplace. 


Still 
more 
curious 
are 
the 
phenomena 
exhibited 
when 
the 
formative 
forces 
of 
the 
liquid 
are 
partly 
disturbed 
by 
putting 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
liquid's 
surface 
some 
rigid 
body. 
If 
we 
immerse, 
for 
example, 
the 
wire 
framework 
of 
a 
cube 
in 
our 
mass 
of 
oil, 
the 
oil 
will 
everywhere 
stick 
to 
the 
wire 
framework. 
If 
the 
quantity 
of 
oil 
is 
exactly 
sufficient 
we 
shall 
obtain 
an 
oil 
cube 
with 
perfectly 
smooth 
walls. 
If 
there 
is 
too 
much 
or 
too 
little 
oil, 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
cube 
will 
bulge 
out 
or 
cave 
in. 
In 
this 
manner 
we 
can 
produce 
all 
kinds 
of 
geometrical 



figures 
of 
oil, 
for 
example, 
a 
three-sided 
pyramid, 
a 
cylinder 
(by 
bringing 
the 
oil 
between 
two 
wire 
rings), 
and 
so 
on. 
Interesting 
is 
the 
change 
of 
form 
that 
occurs 
when 
we 
gradually 
suck 
out 
the 
oil 
by 
means 
of 
a 
glass 
tube 
from 
the 
cube 
or 
pyramid. 
The 
wire 
holds 
the 
oil 
fast. 
The 
figure 
grows 
smaller 
and 
smaller, 
until 
it 
is 
at 
last 
quite 
thin. 
Ultimately 
it 
consists 
simply 
of 
a 
number 
of 
thin, 
smooth 
plates 
of 
oil, 
which 
extend 
from 
the 
edges 
of 
the 
cube 
to 
the 
centre, 
where 
they 
meet 
in 
a 
small 
drop. 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
pyramid. 


The 
idea 
now 
suggests 
itself 
that 
liquid 
figures 
as 
thin 
as 
this, 
and 
possessing, 
therefore, 
so 
slight 
a 
weight, 
cannot 
be 
crushed 
or 
deformed 
by 
their 
weight; 
just 
as 
a 
small, 
soft 
ball 
of 
clay 
is 
not 
affected 
in 
this 
respect 
by 
its 
weight. 
This 
being 
the 
case, 
we 
no 
longer 
need 
our 
mixture 
of 
alcohol 
and 
water 
for 
the 
production 
of 
figures, 
but 
can 
construct 
them 
in 
the 
open 
air. 
And 
Plateau, 
in 
fact, 
found 
that 
these 
thin 
figures, 
or 
at 
least 
very 
similar 
ones, 
could 
be 
produced 
in 
the 
air, 
by 
dipping 
the 
wire 
nets 
described 
in 
a 
solution 
of 
soap 
and 
water 
and 
quickly 
drawing 
them 
out 
again. 
The 
experiment 
is 
not 
difficult. 
The 
figure 
is 
formed 
of 
itself. 
The 
preceding 
drawing 
represents 
to 
the 
eye 
the 
forms 
obtained 
with 
cubical 
and 
pyramidal 
nets. 
In 
the 
cube, 
thin, 
smooth 
films 
of 
soap-suds 
proceed 
from 
the 
edges 
to 
a 
small, 
quadratic 
film 
in 
the 
centre. 
In 
the 
pyramid, 
a 
film 
proceeds 
from 
each 
edge 
to 
the 
centre. 


These 
figures 
are 
so 
beautiful 
that 
they 
hardly 
admit 
of 
appropriate 
description. 
Their 
great 
regularity 
and 
geometrical 
exactness 
evokes 
surprise 
from 
all 
who 
see 
them 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
Unfortunately, 
they 
are 
of 
only 
short 
duration. 
They 
burst, 
on 
the 
drying 
of 
the 
solution 
in 
the 
air, 
but 
only 
after 
exhibiting 
to 
us 
the 
most 
brilliant 
play 
of 
colors, 
such 
as 
is 
often 
seen 
in 
soap-
bubbles. 
Partly 
their 
beauty 
of 
form 
and 
partly 
our 
desire 
to 
examine 
them 
more 
minutely 
induces 
us 
to 
conceive 
of 
methods 
of 
endowing 
them 
with 
permanent 
form. 
This 
is 
very 
simply 
done. 
[2] 
Instead 
of 
dipping 
the 
wire 
nets 
in 
solutions 
of 
soap, 
we 
dip 
them 
in 
pure 
melted 
colophonium 
(resin). 
When 
drawn 
out 
the 
figure 
at 
once 
forms 
and 
solidifies 
by 
contact 
with 
the 
air. 


It 
is 
to 
be 
remarked 
that 
also 
solid 
fluid-figures 
can 
be 
constructed 
in 
the 
open 
air, 
if 
their 
weight 
be 
light 
enough, 
or 
the 
wire 
nets 
of 
very 
small 
dimensions. 
If 
we 
make, 
for 
example, 
of 
very 
fine 
wire 
a 
cubical 
net 
whose 
sides 
measure 
about 
one-eighth 
of 
an 
inch 
in 
length, 
we 
need 
simply 
to 
dip 
this 
net 
in 
water 
to 
obtain 
a 
small 
solid 
cube 
of 
water. 
With 
a 
piece 
of 
blotting 



paper 
the 
superfluous 
water 
may 
be 
easily 
removed 
and 
the 
sides 
of 
the 
cube 
made 
smooth. 


Yet 
another 
simple 
method 
may 
be 
devised 
for 
observing 
these 
figures. 
A 
drop 
of 
water 
on 
a 
greased 
glass 
plate 
will 
not 
run 
if 
it 
is 
small 
enough, 
but 
will 
be 
flattened 
by 
its 
weight, 
which 
presses 
it 
against 
its 
support. 
The 
smaller 
the 
drop 
the 
less 
the 
flattening. 
The 
smaller 
the 
drop 
the 
nearer 
it 
approaches 
the 
form 
of 
a 
sphere. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
drop 
suspended 
from 
a 
stick 
is 
elongated 
by 
its 
weight. 
The 
undermost 
parts 
of 
a 
drop 
of 
water 
on 
a 
support 
are 
pressed 
against 
the 
support, 
and 
the 
upper 
parts 
are 
pressed 
against 
the 
lower 
parts 
because 
the 
latter 
cannot 
yield. 
But 
when 
a 
drop 
falls 
freely 
downward 
all 
its 
parts 
move 
equally 
fast; 
no 
part 
is 
impeded 
by 
another; 
no 
part 
presses 
against 
another. 
A 
freely 
falling 
drop, 
accordingly, 
is 
not 
affected 
by 
its 
weight; 
it 
acts 
as 
if 
it 
were 
weightless; 
it 
assumes 
a 
spherical 
form. 


A 
moment's 
glance 
at 
the 
soap-film 
figures 
produced 
by 
our 
various 
wire 
models, 
reveals 
to 
us 
a 
great 
multiplicity 
of 
form. 
But 
great 
as 
this 
multiplicity 
is, 
the 
common 
features 
of 
the 
figures 
also 
are 
easily 
discernible. 


"All 
forms 
of 
Nature 
are 
allied, 
though 
none 
is 
the 
same 
as 
the 
other; 
Thus, 
their 
common 
chorus 
points 
to 
a 
hidden 
law." 


This 
hidden 
law 
Plateau 
discovered. 
It 
may 
be 
expressed, 
somewhat 
prosily, 
as 
follows: 


1) 
If 
several 
plane 
liquid 
films 
meet 
in 
a 
figure 
they 
are 
always 
three 
in 
number, 
and, 
taken 
in 
pairs, 
form, 
each 
with 
another, 
nearly 
equal 
angles. 
2) 
If 
several 
liquid 
edges 
meet 
in 
a 
figure 
they 
are 
always 
four 
in 
number, 
and, 
taken 
in 
pairs, 
form, 
each 
with 
another, 
nearly 
equal 
angles. 
This 
is 
a 
strange 
law, 
and 
its 
reason 
is 
not 
evident. 
But 
we 
might 
apply 
this 
criticism 
to 
almost 
all 
laws. 
It 
is 
not 
always 
that 
the 
motives 
of 
a 
law-maker 
are 
discernible 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
law 
he 
constructs. 
But 
our 
law 
admits 
of 
analysis 
into 
very 
simple 
elements 
or 
reasons. 
If 
we 
closely 
examine 
the 
paragraphs 
which 
state 
it, 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
their 
meaning 
is 
simply 
this, 
that 



the 
surface 
of 
the 
liquid 
assumes 
the 
shape 
of 
smallest 
area 
that 
is 
possible 
under 
the 
circumstances. 


If, 
therefore, 
some 
extraordinarily 
intelligent 
tailor, 
possessing 
a 
knowledge 
of 
all 
the 
artifices 
of 
the 
higher 
mathematics, 
should 
set 
himself 
the 
task 
of 
so 
covering 
the 
wire 
frame 
of 
a 
cube 
with 
cloth 
that 
every 
piece 
of 
cloth 
should 
be 
connected 
with 
the 
wire 
and 
joined 
with 
the 
remaining 
cloth, 
and 
should 
seek 
to 
accomplish 
this 
feat 
with 
the 
greatest 
saving 
of 
material, 
he 
would 
construct 
no 
other 
figure 
than 
that 
which 
is 
here 
formed 
on 
the 
wire 
frame 
in 
our 
solution 
of 
soap 
and 
water. 
Nature 
acts 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
liquid 
figures 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
a 
covetous 
tailor, 
and 
gives 
no 
thought 
in 
her 
work 
to 
the 
fashions. 
But, 
strange 
to 
say, 
in 
this 
work, 
the 
most 
beautiful 
fashions 
are 
of 
themselves 
produced. 


The 
two 
paragraphs 
which 
state 
our 
law 
apply 
primarily 
only 
to 
soap-film 
figures, 
and 
are 
not 
applicable, 
of 
course, 
to 
solid 
oil-figures. 
But 
the 
principle 
that 
the 
superficial 
area 
of 
the 
liquid 
shall 
be 
the 
least 
possible 
under 
the 
circumstances, 
is 
applicable 
to 
all 
fluid 
figures. 
He 
who 
understands 
not 
only 
the 
letter 
but 
also 
the 
reason 
of 
the 
law 
will 
not 
be 
at 
a 
loss 
when 
confronted 
with 
cases 
to 
which 
the 
letter 
does 
not 
accurately 
apply. 
And 
this 
is 
the 
case 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
superficial 
area. 
It 
is 
a 
sure 
guide 
for 
us 
even 
in 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
above-stated 
paragraphs 
are 
not 
applicable. 


Our 
first 
task 
will 
now 
be, 
to 
show 
by 
a 
palpable 
illustration 
the 
mode 
of 
formation 
of 
liquid 
figures 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
superficial 
area. 
The 
oil 
on 
the 
wire 
pyramid 
in 
our 
mixture 
of 
alcohol 
and 
water, 
being 
unable 
to 
leave 
the 
wire 
edges, 
clings 
to 
them, 
and 
the 
given 
mass 
of 
oil 
strives 
so 
to 
shape 
itself 
that 
its 
surface 
shall 
have 
the 
least 
possible 
area. 
Suppose 
we 
attempt 
to 
imitate 
this 
phenomenon. 
We 
take 
a 
wire 
pyramid, 
draw 
over 
it 
a 
stout 
film 
of 
rubber, 
and 
in 
place 
of 
the 
wire 
handle 
insert 
a 
small 
tube 
leading 
into 
the 
interior 
of 
the 
space 
enclosed 
by 
the 
rubber 
(Fig. 
3). 
Through 
this 
tube 
we 
can 
blow 
in 
or 
suck 
out 
air. 
The 
quantity 
of 
air 
in 
the 
enclosure 
represents 
the 
quantity 
of 
oil. 
The 
stretched 
rubber 
film, 
which, 
clinging 
to 
the 
wire 
edges, 
does 
its 
utmost 
to 
contract, 
represents 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
oil 
endeavoring 
to 
decrease 
its 
area. 
By 
blowing 
in, 
and 
drawing 
out 
the 
air, 
now, 
we 
actually 
obtain 
all 
the 
oil 
pyramidal 
figures, 
from 
those 
bulged 
out 



to 
those 
hollowed 
in. 
Finally, 
when 
all 
the 
air 
is 
pumped 
or 
sucked 
out, 
the 
soap-film 
figure 
is 
exhibited. 
The 
rubber 
films 
strike 
together, 
assume 
the 
form 
of 
planes, 
and 
meet 
at 
four 
sharp 
edges 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
pyramid. 


The 
tendency 
of 
soap-films 
to 
assume 
smaller 
forms 
may 
be 
directly 
demonstrated 
by 
a 
method 
of 
Van 
der 
Mensbrugghe. 
If 
we 
dip 
a 
square 
wire 
frame 
to 
which 
a 
handle 
is 
attached 
into 
a 
solution 
of 
soap 
and 
water, 
we 
shall 
obtain 
on 
the 
frame 
a 
beautiful, 
plane 
film 
of 
soap-suds. 
(Fig. 
4.) 
On 
this 
we 
lay 
a 
thread 
having 
its 
two 
ends 
tied 
together. 
If, 
now, 
we 
puncture 
the 
part 
enclosed 
by 
the 
thread, 
we 
shall 
obtain 
a 
soap-film 
having 
a 
circular 
hole 
in 
it, 
whose 
circumference 
is 
the 
thread. 
The 
remainder 
of 
the 
film 
decreasing 
in 
area 
as 
much 
as 
it 
can, 
the 
hole 
assumes 
the 
largest 
area 
that 
it 
can. 
But 
the 
figure 
of 
largest 
area, 
with 
a 
given 
periphery, 
is 
the 
circle. 


Similarly, 
by 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
superficial 
area, 
a 
freely 
suspended 
mass 
of 
oil 
assumes 
the 
shape 
of 
a 
sphere. 
The 
sphere 
is 
the 
form 
of 
least 
surface 
for 
a 
given 
content. 
This 
is 
evident. 
The 
more 
we 
put 
into 
a 
travelling-bag, 
the 
nearer 
its 
shape 
approaches 
the 
spherical 
form. 


The 
connexion 
of 
the 
two 
above-mentioned 
paragraphs 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
superficial 
area 
may 
be 
shown 
by 
a 
yet 
simpler 
example. 
Picture 
to 
yourselves 
four 
fixed 
pulleys, 
a, 
b, 
c, 
d, 
and 
two 
movable 
rings 
f, 
g 
(Fig. 
5); 
about 
the 
pulleys 
and 
through 
the 
rings 
imagine 
a 
smooth 
cord 
passed, 
fastened 
at 
one 
extremity 
to 
a 
nail 
e, 
and 
loaded 
at 
the 
other 
with 
a 
weight 
h. 
Now 
this 
weight 
always 
tends 
to 
sink, 
or, 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
always 
tends 
to 
make 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
string 
eh 
as 
long 
as 
possible, 
and 
consequently 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
string, 
wound 
round 
the 
pulleys, 
as 
short 
as 
possible. 
The 
strings 
must 
remain 
connected 
with 
the 
pulleys, 
and 
on 
account 
of 
the 
rings 
also 
with 
each 
other. 
The 
conditions 
of 
the 
case, 
accordingly, 
are 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
the 
liquid 
figures 
discussed. 
The 
result 
also 
is 
a 
similar 
one. 
When, 
as 
in 
the 
right 
hand 
figure 
of 
the 
cut, 
four 
pairs 
of 
strings 
meet, 
a 
different 
configuration 
must 
be 
established. 
The 
consequence 
of 
the 
endeavor 
of 
the 
string 
to 
shorten 
itself 
is 
that 
the 
rings 
separate 
from 
each 
other, 
and 
that 
now 
at 
all 
points 
only 
three 
pairs 
of 
strings 
meet, 
every 
two 
at 
equal 
angles 
of 
one 
hundred 
and 
twenty 
degrees. 
As 
a 
fact, 
by 
this 
arrangement 
the 
greatest 
possible 
shortening 
of 
the 
string 
is 
attained; 
as 
can 
be 
easily 
proved 
by 
geometry. 



This 
will 
help 
us 
to 
some 
extent 
to 
understand 
the 
creation 
of 
beautiful 
and 
complicated 
figures 
by 
the 
simple 
tendency 
of 
liquids 
to 
assume 
surfaces 
of 
least 
superficial 
area. 
But 
the 
question 
arises, 
Why 
do 
liquids 
seek 
surfaces 
of 
least 
superficial 
area? 


The 
particles 
of 
a 
liquid 
cling 
together. 
Drops 
brought 
into 
contact 
coalesce. 
We 
can 
say, 
liquid 
particles 
attract 
each 
other. 
If 
so, 
they 
seek 
to 
come 
as 
close 
as 
they 
can 
to 
each 
other. 
The 
particles 
at 
the 
surface 
will 
endeavor 
to 
penetrate 
as 
far 
as 
they 
can 
into 
the 
interior. 
This 
process 
will 
not 
stop, 
cannot 
stop, 
until 
the 
surface 
has 
become 
as 
small 
as 
under 
the 
circumstances 
it 
possibly 
can 
become, 
until 
as 
few 
particles 
as 
possible 
remain 
at 
the 
surface, 
until 
as 
many 
particles 
as 
possible 
have 
penetrated 
into 
the 
interior, 
until 
the 
forces 
of 
attraction 
have 
no 
more 
work 
to 
perform. 
[3] 


The 
root 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
surface 
is 
to 
be 
sought, 
accordingly, 
in 
another 
and 
much 
simpler 
principle, 
which 
may 
be 
illustrated 
by 
some 
such 
analogy 
as 
this. 
We 
can 
conceive 
of 
the 
natural 
forces 
of 
attraction 
and 
repulsion 
as 
purposes 
or 
intentions 
of 
nature. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
fact, 
that 
interior 
pressure 
which 
we 
feel 
before 
an 
act 
and 
which 
we 
call 
an 
intention 
or 
purpose, 
is 
not, 
in 
a 
final 
analysis, 
so 
essentially 
different 
from 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
stone 
on 
its 
support, 
or 
the 
pressure 
of 
a 
magnet 
on 
another, 
that 
it 
is 
necessarily 
unallowable 
to 
use 
for 
both 
the 
same 
term—at 
least 
for 
well-
defined 
purposes. 
[4] 
It 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
nature, 
accordingly, 
to 
bring 
the 
iron 
nearer 
the 
magnet, 
the 
stone 
nearer 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
so 
forth. 
If 
such 
a 
purpose 
can 
be 
realised, 
it 
is 
carried 
out. 
But 
where 
she 
cannot 
realise 
her 
purposes, 
nature 
does 
nothing. 
In 
this 
respect 
she 
acts 
exactly 
as 
a 
good 
man 
of 
business 
does. 


It 
is 
a 
constant 
purpose 
of 
nature 
to 
bring 
weights 
lower. 
We 
can 
raise 
a 
weight 
by 
causing 
another, 
larger 
weight 
to 
sink; 
that 
is, 
by 
satisfying 
another, 
more 
powerful, 
purpose 
of 
nature. 
If 
we 
fancy 
we 
are 
making 
nature 
serve 
our 
purposes 
in 
this, 
it 
will 
be 
found, 
upon 
closer 
examination, 
that 
the 
contrary 
is 
true, 
and 
that 
nature 
has 
employed 
us 
to 
attain 
her 
purposes. 


Equilibrium, 
rest, 
exists 
only, 
but 
then 
always, 
when 
nature 
is 
brought 
to 
a 
halt 
in 
her 
purposes, 
when 
the 
forces 
of 
nature 
are 
as 
fully 
satisfied 
as, 
under 
the 
circumstances, 
they 
can 
be. 
Thus, 
for 
example, 
heavy 
bodies 
are 
in 



equilibrium, 
when 
their 
so-called 
centre 
of 
gravity 
lies 
as 
low 
as 
it 
possibly 
can, 
or 
when 
as 
much 
weight 
as 
the 
circumstances 
admit 
of 
has 
sunk 
as 
low 
as 
it 
can. 


The 
idea 
forcibly 
suggests 
itself 
that 
perhaps 
this 
principle 
also 
holds 
good 
in 
other 
realms. 
Equilibrium 
exists 
also 
in 
the 
state 
when 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
parties 
are 
as 
fully 
satisfied 
as 
for 
the 
time 
being 
they 
can 
be, 
or, 
as 
we 
may 
say, 
jestingly, 
in 
the 
language 
of 
physics, 
when 
the 
social 
potential 
is 
a 
maximum. 
[5] 


You 
see, 
our 
miserly 
mercantile 
principle 
is 
replete 
with 
consequences. 
[6] 
The 
result 
of 
sober 
research, 
it 
has 
become 
as 
fruitful 
for 
physics 
as 
the 
dry 
questions 
of 
Socrates 
for 
science 
generally. 
If 
the 
principle 
seems 
to 
lack 
in 
ideality, 
the 
more 
ideal 
are 
the 
fruits 
which 
it 
bears. 


But 
why, 
tell 
me, 
should 
science 
be 
ashamed 
of 
such 
a 
principle? 
Is 
science 


[7] 
itself 
anything 
more 
than—a 
business? 
Is 
not 
its 
task 
to 
acquire 
with 
the 
least 
possible 
work, 
in 
the 
least 
possible 
time, 
with 
the 
least 
possible 
thought, 
the 
greatest 
possible 
part 
of 
eternal 
truth? 

THE 
FIBRES 
OF 
CORTI. 


Whoever 
has 
roamed 
through 
a 
beautiful 
country 
knows 
that 
the 
tourist's 
delights 
increase 
with 
his 
progress. 
How 
pretty 
that 
wooded 
dell 
must 
look 
from 
yonder 
hill! 
Whither 
does 
that 
clear 
brook 
flow, 
that 
hides 
itself 
in 
yonder 
sedge? 
If 
I 
only 
knew 
how 
the 
landscape 
looked 
behind 
that 
mountain! 
Thus 
even 
the 
child 
thinks 
in 
his 
first 
rambles. 
It 
is 
also 
true 
of 
the 
natural 
philosopher. 


The 
first 
questions 
are 
forced 
upon 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
inquirer 
by 
practical 
considerations; 
the 
subsequent 
ones 
are 
not. 
An 
irresistible 
attraction 
draws 
him 
to 
these; 
a 
nobler 
interest 
which 
far 
transcends 
the 
mere 
needs 
of 
life. 
Let 
us 
look 
at 
a 
special 
case. 


For 
a 
long 
time 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
organ 
of 
hearing 
has 
actively 
engaged 
the 
attention 
of 
anatomists. 
A 
considerable 
number 
of 
brilliant 
discoveries 
has 
been 
brought 
to 
light 
by 
their 
labors, 
and 
a 
splendid 
array 
of 
facts 
and 
truths 
established. 
But 
with 
these 
facts 
a 
host 
of 
new 
enigmas 
has 
been 
presented. 


Whilst 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
organisation 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
eye 
comparative 
clearness 
has 
been 
attained; 
whilst, 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
this, 
ophthalmology 
has 
reached 
a 
degree 
of 
perfection 
which 
the 
preceding 
century 
could 
hardly 
have 
dreamed 
of, 
and 
by 
the 
help 
of 
the 
ophthalmoscope 
the 
observing 
physician 
penetrates 
into 
the 
profoundest 
recesses 
of 
the 
eye, 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
ear 
is 
still 
much 
shrouded 
in 
mysterious 
darkness, 
full 
of 
attraction 
for 
the 
investigator. 


Look 
at 
this 
model 
of 
the 
ear. 
Even 
at 
that 
familiar 
part 
by 
whose 
extent 
we 
measure 
the 
quantity 
of 
people's 
intelligence, 
even 
at 
the 
external 
ear, 
the 
problems 
begin. 
You 
see 
here 
a 
succession 
of 
helixes 
or 
spiral 
windings, 
at 
times 
very 
pretty, 
whose 
significance 
we 
cannot 
accurately 
state, 
yet 
for 
which 
there 
must 
certainly 
be 
some 
reason. 


The 
shell 
or 
concha 
of 
the 
ear, 
a 
in 
the 
annexed 
diagram, 
conducts 
the 
sound 
into 
the 
curved 
auditory 
passage 
b, 
which 
is 
terminated 
by 
a 
thin 
membrane, 



the 
so-called 
tympanic 
membrane, 
e. 
This 
membrane 
is 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
the 
sound, 
and 
in 
its 
turn 
sets 
in 
motion 
a 
series 
of 
little 
bones 
of 
very 
peculiar 
formation, 
c. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
all 
is 
the 
labyrinth 
d. 
The 
labyrinth 
consists 
of 
a 
group 
of 
cavities 
filled 
with 
a 
liquid, 
in 
which 
the 
innumerable 
fibres 
of 
the 
nerve 
of 
hearing 
are 
imbedded. 
By 
the 
vibration 
of 
the 
chain 
of 
bones 
c, 
the 
liquid 
of 
the 
labyrinth 
is 
shaken, 
and 
the 
auditory 
nerve 
excited. 
Here 
the 
process 
of 
hearing 
begins. 
So 
much 
is 
certain. 
But 
the 
details 
of 
the 
process 
are 
one 
and 
all 
unanswered 
questions. 


To 
these 
old 
puzzles, 
the 
Marchese 
Corti, 
as 
late 
as 
1851, 
added 
a 
new 
enigma. 
And, 
strange 
to 
say, 
it 
is 
this 
last 
enigma, 
which, 
perhaps, 
has 
first 
received 
its 
correct 
solution. 
This 
will 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
our 
remarks 
to-day. 


Corti 
found 
in 
the 
cochlea, 
or 
snail-shell 
of 
the 
labyrinth, 
a 
large 
number 
of 
microscopic 
fibres 
placed 
side 
by 
side 
in 
geometrically 
graduated 
order. 
According 
to 
Kölliker 
their 
number 
is 
three 
thousand. 
They 
were 
also 
the 
subject 
of 
investigation 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
Max 
Schultze 
and 
Deiters. 


A 
description 
of 
the 
details 
of 
this 
organ 
would 
only 
weary 
you, 
besides 
not 
rendering 
the 
matter 
much 
clearer. 
I 
prefer, 
therefore, 
to 
state 
briefly 
what 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
prominent 
investigators 
like 
Helmholtz 
and 
Fechner 
is 
the 
peculiar 
function 
of 
Corti's 
fibres. 
The 
cochlea, 
it 
seems, 
contains 
a 
large 
number 
of 
elastic 
fibres 
of 
graduated 
lengths 
(Fig. 
7), 
to 
which 
the 
branches 
of 
the 
auditory 
nerve 
are 
attached. 
These 
fibres, 
called 
the 
fibres, 
pillars, 
or 
rods 
of 
Corti, 
being 
of 
unequal 
length, 
must 
also 
be 
of 
unequal 
elasticity, 
and, 
consequently, 
pitched 
to 
different 
notes. 
The 
cochlea, 
therefore, 
is 
a 
species 
of 
pianoforte. 


What, 
now, 
may 
be 
the 
office 
of 
this 
structure, 
which 
is 
found 
in 
no 
other 
organ 
of 
sense? 
May 
it 
not 
be 
connected 
with 
some 
special 
property 
of 
the 
ear? 
It 
is 
quite 
probable; 
for 
the 
ear 
possesses 
a 
very 
similar 
power. 
You 
know 
that 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
follow 
the 
individual 
voices 
of 
a 
symphony. 
Indeed, 
the 
feat 
is 
possible 
even 
in 
a 
fugue 
of 
Bach, 
where 
it 
is 
certainly 
no 
inconsiderable 
achievement. 
The 
ear 
can 
pick 
out 
the 
single 
constituent 
tonal 
parts, 
not 
only 
of 
a 
harmony, 
but 
of 
the 
wildest 
clash 
of 
music 
imaginable. 
The 
musical 
ear 
analyses 
every 
agglomeration 
of 
tones. 


The 
eye 
does 
not 
possess 
this 
ability. 
Who, 
for 
example, 
could 
tell 
from 
the 



mere 
sight 
of 
white, 
without 
a 
previous 
experimental 
knowledge 
of 
the 
fact, 
that 
white 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
mixture 
of 
other 
colors? 
Could 
it 
be, 
now, 
that 
these 
two 
facts, 
the 
property 
of 
the 
ear 
just 
mentioned, 
and 
the 
structure 
discovered 
by 
Corti, 
are 
really 
connected? 
It 
is 
very 
probable. 
The 
enigma 
is 
solved 
if 
we 
assume 
that 
every 
note 
of 
definite 
pitch 
has 
its 
special 
string 
in 
this 
pianoforte 
of 
Corti, 
and, 
therefore, 
its 
special 
branch 
of 
the 
auditory 
nerve 
attached 
to 
that 
string. 
But 
before 
I 
can 
make 
this 
point 
perfectly 
plain 
to 
you, 
I 
must 
ask 
you 
to 
follow 
me 
a 
few 
steps 
into 
the 
dry 
domain 
of 
physics. 


Look 
at 
this 
pendulum. 
Forced 
from 
its 
position 
of 
equilibrium 
by 
an 
impulse, 
it 
begins 
to 
swing 
with 
a 
definite 
time 
of 
oscillation, 
dependent 
upon 
its 
length. 
Longer 
pendulums 
swing 
more 
slowly, 
shorter 
ones 
more 
quickly. 
We 
will 
suppose 
our 
pendulum 
to 
execute 
one 
to-and-fro 
movement 
in 
a 
second. 


This 
pendulum, 
now, 
can 
be 
thrown 
into 
violent 
vibration 
in 
two 
ways; 
either 
by 
a 
single 
heavy 
impulse, 
or 
by 
a 
number 
of 
properly 
communicated 
slight 
impulses. 
For 
example, 
we 
impart 
to 
the 
pendulum, 
while 
at 
rest 
in 
its 
position 
of 
equilibrium, 
a 
very 
slight 
impulse. 
It 
will 
execute 
a 
very 
small 
vibration. 
As 
it 
passes 
a 
third 
time 
its 
position 
of 
equilibrium, 
a 
second 
having 
elapsed, 
we 
impart 
to 
it 
again 
a 
slight 
shock, 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
with 
the 
first. 
Again 
after 
the 
lapse 
of 
a 
second, 
on 
its 
fifth 
passage 
through 
the 
position 
of 
equilibrium, 
we 
strike 
it 
again 
in 
the 
same 
manner; 
and 
so 
continue. 
You 
see, 
by 
this 
process 
the 
shocks 
imparted 
augment 
continually 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
pendulum. 
After 
each 
slight 
impulse, 
the 
pendulum 
reaches 
out 
a 
little 
further 
in 
its 
swing, 
and 
finally 
acquires 
a 
considerable 
motion. 
[8] 


But 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case 
under 
all 
circumstances. 
It 
is 
possible 
only 
when 
the 
impulses 
imparted 
synchronise 
with 
the 
swings 
of 
the 
pendulum. 
If 
we 
should 
communicate 
the 
second 
impulse 
at 
the 
end 
of 
half 
a 
second 
and 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
with 
the 
first 
impulse, 
its 
effects 
would 
counteract 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
pendulum. 
It 
is 
easily 
seen 
that 
our 
little 
impulses 
help 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
pendulum 
more 
and 
more, 
according 
as 
their 
time 
accords 
with 
the 
time 
of 
the 
pendulum. 
If 
we 
strike 
the 
pendulum 
in 
any 
other 
time 
than 
in 
that 
of 
its 
vibration, 
in 
some 
instances, 
it 
is 
true, 
we 
shall 
augment 
its 
vibration, 
but 
in 
others 
again, 
we 
shall 
obstruct 
it. 
Our 
impulses 
will 
be 
less 
effective 
the 



more 
the 
motion 
of 
our 
own 
hand 
departs 
from 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
pendulum. 


What 
is 
true 
of 
the 
pendulum 
holds 
true 
of 
every 
vibrating 
body. 
A 
tuning-
fork 
when 
it 
sounds, 
also 
vibrates. 
It 
vibrates 
more 
rapidly 
when 
its 
sound 
is 
higher; 
more 
slowly 
when 
it 
is 
deeper. 
The 
standard 
A 
of 
our 
musical 
scale 
is 
produced 
by 
about 
four 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
vibrations 
in 
a 
second. 


I 
place 
by 
the 
side 
of 
each 
other 
on 
this 
table 
two 
tuning-forks, 
exactly 
alike, 
resting 
on 
resonant 
cases. 
I 
strike 
the 
first 
one 
a 
sharp 
blow, 
so 
that 
it 
emits 
a 
loud 
note, 
and 
immediately 
grasp 
it 
again 
with 
my 
hand 
to 
quench 
its 
note. 
Nevertheless, 
you 
still 
hear 
the 
note 
distinctly 
sounded, 
and 
by 
feeling 
it 
you 
may 
convince 
yourselves 
that 
the 
other 
fork 
which 
was 
not 
struck 
now 
vibrates. 


I 
now 
attach 
a 
small 
bit 
of 
wax 
to 
one 
of 
the 
forks. 
It 
is 
thrown 
thus 
out 
of 
tune; 
its 
note 
is 
made 
a 
little 
deeper. 
I 
now 
repeat 
the 
same 
experiment 
with 
the 
two 
forks, 
now 
of 
unequal 
pitch, 
by 
striking 
one 
of 
them 
and 
again 
grasping 
it 
with 
my 
hand; 
but 
in 
the 
present 
case 
the 
note 
ceases 
the 
very 
instant 
I 
touch 
the 
fork. 


What 
has 
happened 
here 
in 
these 
two 
experiments? 
Simply 
this. 
The 
vibrating 
fork 
imparts 
to 
the 
air 
and 
to 
the 
table 
four 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
shocks 
a 
second, 
which 
are 
carried 
over 
to 
the 
other 
fork. 
If 
the 
other 
fork 
is 
pitched 
to 
the 
same 
note, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
if 
it 
vibrates 
when 
struck 
in 
the 
same 
time 
with 
the 
first, 
then 
the 
shocks 
first 
emitted, 
no 
matter 
how 
slight 
they 
may 
be, 
are 
sufficient 
to 
throw 
the 
second 
fork 
into 
rapid 
sympathetic 
vibration. 
But 
when 
the 
time 
of 
vibration 
of 
the 
two 
forks 
is 
slightly 
different, 
this 
does 
not 
take 
place. 
We 
may 
strike 
as 
many 
forks 
as 
we 
will, 
the 
fork 
tuned 
to 
A 
is 
perfectly 
indifferent 
to 
their 
notes; 
is 
deaf, 
in 
fact, 
to 
all 
except 
its 
own; 
and 
if 
you 
strike 
three, 
or 
four, 
or 
five, 
or 
any 
number 
whatsoever, 
of 
forks 
all 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
so 
as 
to 
make 
the 
shocks 
which 
come 
from 
them 
ever 
so 
great, 
the 
A 
fork 
will 
not 
join 
in 
with 
their 
vibrations 
unless 
another 
fork 
A 
is 
found 
in 
the 
collection 
struck. 
It 
picks 
out, 
in 
other 
words, 
from 
all 
the 
notes 
sounded, 
that 
which 
accords 
with 
it. 


The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
all 
bodies 
which 
can 
yield 
notes. 
Tumblers 
resound 
when 
a 
piano 
is 
played, 
on 
the 
striking 
of 
certain 
notes, 
and 
so 
do 
window 
panes. 
Nor 
is 
the 
phenomenon 
without 
analogy 
in 
other 
provinces. 
Take 
a 
dog 
that 



answers 
to 
the 
name 
"Nero." 
He 
lies 
under 
your 
table. 
You 
speak 
of 
Domitian, 
Vespasian, 
and 
Marcus 
Aurelius 
Antoninus, 
you 
call 
upon 
all 
the 
names 
of 
the 
Roman 
Emperors 
that 
occur 
to 
you, 
but 
the 
dog 
does 
not 
stir, 
although 
a 
slight 
tremor 
of 
his 
ear 
tells 
you 
of 
a 
faint 
response 
of 
his 
consciousness. 
But 
the 
moment 
you 
call 
"Nero" 
he 
jumps 
joyfully 
towards 
you. 
The 
tuning-fork 
is 
like 
your 
dog. 
It 
answers 
to 
the 
name 
A. 


You 
smile, 
ladies. 
You 
shake 
your 
heads. 
The 
simile 
does 
not 
catch 
your 
fancy. 
But 
I 
have 
another, 
which 
is 
very 
near 
to 
you: 
and 
for 
punishment 
you 
shall 
hear 
it. 
You, 
too, 
are 
like 
tuning-forks. 
Many 
are 
the 
hearts 
that 
throb 
with 
ardor 
for 
you, 
of 
which 
you 
take 
no 
notice, 
but 
are 
cold. 
Yet 
what 
does 
it 
profit 
you! 
Soon 
the 
heart 
will 
come 
that 
beats 
in 
just 
the 
proper 
rhythm, 
and 
then 
your 
knell, 
too, 
has 
struck. 
Then 
your 
heart, 
too, 
will 
beat 
in 
unison, 
whether 
you 
will 
or 
no. 


The 
law 
of 
sympathetic 
vibration, 
here 
propounded 
for 
sounding 
bodies, 
suffers 
some 
modification 
for 
bodies 
incompetent 
to 
yield 
notes. 
Bodies 
of 
this 
kind 
vibrate 
to 
almost 
every 
note. 
A 
high 
silk 
hat, 
we 
know, 
will 
not 
sound; 
but 
if 
you 
will 
hold 
your 
hat 
in 
your 
hand 
when 
attending 
your 
next 
concert 
you 
will 
not 
only 
hear 
the 
pieces 
played, 
but 
also 
feel 
them 
with 
your 
fingers. 
It 
is 
exactly 
so 
with 
men. 
People 
who 
are 
themselves 
able 
to 
give 
tone 
to 
their 
surroundings, 
bother 
little 
about 
the 
prattle 
of 
others. 
But 
the 
person 
without 
character 
tarries 
everywhere: 
in 
the 
temperance 
hall, 
and 
at 
the 
bar 
of 
the 
public-house—everywhere 
where 
a 
committee 
is 
formed. 
The 
high 
silk 
hat 
is 
among 
bells 
what 
the 
weakling 
is 
among 
men 
of 
conviction. 


A 
sonorous 
body, 
therefore, 
always 
sounds 
when 
its 
special 
note, 
either 
alone 
or 
in 
company 
with 
others, 
is 
struck. 
We 
may 
now 
go 
a 
step 
further. 
What 
will 
be 
the 
behaviour 
of 
a 
group 
of 
sonorous 
bodies 
which 
in 
the 
pitch 
of 
their 
notes 
form 
a 
scale? 
Let 
us 
picture 
to 
ourselves, 
for 
example 
(Fig. 
8), 
a 
series 
of 
rods 
or 
strings 
pitched 
to 
the 
notes 
cdefg.... 
On 
a 
musical 
instrument 
the 
accord 
ceg 
is 
struck. 
Every 
one 
of 
the 
rods 
of 
Fig. 
8 
will 
see 
if 
its 
special 
note 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
accord, 
and 
if 
it 
finds 
it, 
it 
will 
respond. 
The 
rod 
c 
will 
give 
at 
once 
the 
note 
c, 
the 
rod 
e 
the 
note 
e, 
the 
rod 
g 
the 
note 


g. 
All 
the 
other 
rods 
will 
remain 
at 
rest, 
will 
not 
sound. 
We 
need 
not 
look 
about 
us 
long 
for 
such 
an 
instrument. 
Every 
piano 
is 
an 
instrument 
of 
this 
kind, 
with 
which 
the 
experiment 
mentioned 
may 
be 



executed 
with 
splendid 
success. 
Two 
pianos 
stand 
here 
by 
the 
side 
of 
each 
other, 
both 
tuned 
alike. 
We 
will 
employ 
the 
first 
for 
exciting 
the 
notes, 
while 
we 
will 
allow 
the 
second 
to 
respond; 
after 
having 
first 
pressed 
upon 
the 
loud 
pedal, 
so 
as 
to 
render 
all 
the 
strings 
capable 
of 
motion. 


Every 
harmony 
struck 
with 
vigor 
on 
the 
first 
piano 
is 
distinctly 
repeated 
on 
the 
second. 
To 
prove 
that 
it 
is 
the 
same 
strings 
that 
are 
sounded 
in 
both 
pianos, 
we 
repeat 
the 
experiment 
in 
a 
slightly 
changed 
form. 
We 
let 
go 
the 
loud 
pedal 
of 
the 
second 
piano 
and 
pressing 
on 
the 
keys 
ceg 
of 
that 
instrument 
vigorously 
strike 
the 
harmony 
ceg 
on 
the 
first 
piano. 
The 
harmony 
ceg 
is 
now 
also 
sounded 
on 
the 
second 
piano. 
But 
if 
we 
press 
only 
on 
one 
key 
g 
of 
one 
piano, 
while 
we 
strike 
ceg 
on 
the 
other, 
only 
g 
will 
be 
sounded 
on 
the 
second. 
It 
is 
thus 
always 
the 
like 
strings 
of 
the 
two 
pianos 
that 
excite 
each 
other. 


The 
piano 
can 
reproduce 
any 
sound 
that 
is 
composed 
of 
its 
musical 
notes. 
It 
will 
reproduce, 
for 
example, 
very 
distinctly, 
a 
vowel 
sound 
that 
is 
sung 
into 
it. 
And 
in 
truth 
physics 
has 
proved 
that 
the 
vowels 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
composed 
of 
simple 
musical 
notes. 


You 
see 
that 
by 
the 
exciting 
of 
definite 
tones 
in 
the 
air 
quite 
definite 
motions 
are 
set 
up 
with 
mechanical 
necessity 
in 
the 
piano. 
The 
idea 
might 
be 
made 
use 
of 
for 
the 
performance 
of 
some 
pretty 
pieces 
of 
wizardry. 
Imagine 
a 
box 
in 
which 
is 
a 
stretched 
string 
of 
definite 
pitch. 
This 
is 
thrown 
into 
motion 
as 
often 
as 
its 
note 
is 
sung 
or 
whistled. 
Now 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
very 
difficult 
task 
for 
a 
skilful 
mechanic 
to 
so 
construct 
the 
box 
that 
the 
vibrating 
cord 
would 
close 
a 
galvanic 
circuit 
and 
open 
the 
lock. 
And 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
much 
more 
difficult 
task 
to 
construct 
a 
box 
which 
would 
open 
at 
the 
whistling 
of 
a 
certain 
melody. 
Sesame! 
and 
the 
bolts 
fall. 
Truly, 
we 
should 
have 
here 
a 
veritable 
puzzle-lock. 
Still 
another 
fragment 
rescued 
from 
that 
old 
kingdom 
of 
fables, 
of 
which 
our 
day 
has 
realised 
so 
much, 
that 
world 
of 
fairy-stories 
to 
which 
the 
latest 
contributions 
are 
Casselli's 
telegraph, 
by 
which 
one 
can 
write 
at 
a 
distance 
in 
one's 
own 
hand, 
and 
Prof. 
Elisha 
Gray's 
telautograph. 
What 
would 
the 
good 
old 
Herodotus 
have 
said 
to 
these 
things 
who 
even 
in 
Egypt 
shook 
his 
head 
at 
much 
that 
he 
saw? 
ἐμοἱ 
μἑνe 
ού 
πιστα, 
just 
as 
simple-
heartedly 
as 
then, 
when 
he 
heard 
of 
the 
circumnavigation 
of 
Africa. 


A 
new 
puzzle-lock! 
But 
why 
invent 
one? 
Are 
not 
we 
human 
beings 
ourselves 



puzzle-locks? 
Think 
of 
the 
stupendous 
groups 
of 
thoughts, 
feelings, 
and 
emotions 
that 
can 
be 
aroused 
in 
us 
by 
a 
word! 
Are 
there 
not 
moments 
in 
all 
our 
lives 
when 
a 
mere 
name 
drives 
the 
blood 
to 
our 
hearts? 
Who 
that 
has 
attended 
a 
large 
mass-meeting 
has 
not 
experienced 
what 
tremendous 
quantities 
of 
energy 
and 
motion 
can 
be 
evolved 
by 
the 
innocent 
words, 
"Liberty, 
Equality, 
Fraternity." 


But 
let 
us 
return 
to 
the 
subject 
proper 
of 
our 
discourse. 
Let 
us 
look 
again 
at 
our 
piano, 
or 
what 
will 
do 
just 
as 
well, 
at 
some 
other 
contrivance 
of 
the 
same 
character. 
What 
does 
this 
instrument 
do? 
Plainly, 
it 
decomposes, 
it 
analyses 
every 
agglomeration 
of 
sounds 
set 
up 
in 
the 
air 
into 
its 
individual 
component 
parts, 
each 
tone 
being 
taken 
up 
by 
a 
different 
string; 
it 
performs 
a 
real 
spectral 
analysis 
of 
sound. 
A 
person 
completely 
deaf, 
with 
the 
help 
of 
a 
piano, 
simply 
by 
touching 
the 
strings 
or 
examining 
their 
vibrations 
with 
a 
microscope, 
might 
investigate 
the 
sonorous 
motion 
of 
the 
air, 
and 
pick 
out 
the 
separate 
tones 
excited 
in 
it. 


The 
ear 
has 
the 
same 
capacity 
as 
this 
piano. 
The 
ear 
performs 
for 
the 
mind 
what 
the 
piano 
performs 
for 
a 
person 
who 
is 
deaf. 
The 
mind 
without 
the 
ear 
is 
deaf. 
But 
a 
deaf 
person, 
with 
the 
piano, 
does 
hear 
after 
a 
fashion, 
though 
much 
less 
vividly, 
and 
more 
clumsily, 
than 
with 
the 
ear. 
The 
ear, 
thus, 
also 
decomposes 
sound 
into 
its 
component 
tonal 
parts. 
I 
shall 
now 
not 
be 
deceived, 
I 
think, 
if 
I 
assume 
that 
you 
already 
have 
a 
presentiment 
of 
what 
the 
function 
of 
Corti's 
fibres 
is. 
We 
can 
make 
the 
matter 
very 
plain 
to 
ourselves. 
We 
will 
use 
the 
one 
piano 
for 
exciting 
the 
sounds, 
and 
we 
shall 
imagine 
the 
second 
one 
in 
the 
ear 
of 
the 
observer 
in 
the 
place 
of 
Corti's 
fibres, 
which 
is 
a 
model 
of 
such 
an 
instrument. 
To 
every 
string 
of 
the 
piano 
in 
the 
ear 
we 
will 
suppose 
a 
special 
fibre 
of 
the 
auditory 
nerve 
attached, 
so 
that 
this 
fibre 
and 
this 
alone, 
is 
irritated 
when 
the 
string 
is 
thrown 
into 
vibration. 
If 
we 
strike 
now 
an 
accord 
on 
the 
external 
piano, 
for 
every 
tone 
of 
that 
accord 
a 
definite 
string 
of 
the 
internal 
piano 
will 
sound 
and 
as 
many 
different 
nervous 
fibres 
will 
be 
irritated 
as 
there 
are 
notes 
in 
the 
accord. 
The 
simultaneous 
sense-impressions 
due 
to 
different 
notes 
can 
thus 
be 
preserved 
unmingled 
and 
be 
separated 
by 
the 
attention. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
as 
with 
the 
five 
fingers 
of 
the 
hand. 
With 
each 
finger 
I 
can 
touch 
something 
different. 
Now 
the 
ear 
has 
three 
thousand 
such 
fingers, 
and 
each 
one 
is 
designed 
for 
the 
touching 
of 
a 
different 
tone. 
[9] 
Our 
ear 
is 
a 
puzzle-lock 
of 
the 
kind 



mentioned. 
It 
opens 
at 
the 
magic 
melody 
of 
a 
sound. 
But 
it 
is 
a 
stupendously 
ingenious 
lock. 
Not 
only 
one 
tone, 
but 
every 
tone 
makes 
it 
open; 
but 
each 
one 
differently. 
To 
each 
tone 
it 
replies 
with 
a 
different 
sensation. 


More 
than 
once 
it 
has 
happened 
in 
the 
history 
of 
science 
that 
a 
phenomenon 
predicted 
by 
theory, 
has 
not 
been 
brought 
within 
the 
range 
of 
actual 
observation 
until 
long 
afterwards. 
Leverrier 
predicted 
the 
existence 
and 
the 
place 
of 
the 
planet 
Neptune, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
until 
sometime 
later 
that 
Galle 
actually 
found 
the 
planet 
at 
the 
predicted 
spot. 
Hamilton 
unfolded 
theoretically 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
the 
so-called 
conical 
refraction 
of 
light, 
but 
it 
was 
reserved 
for 
Lloyd 
some 
time 
subsequently 
to 
observe 
the 
fact. 
The 
fortunes 
of 
Helmholtz's 
theory 
of 
Corti's 
fibres 
have 
been 
somewhat 
similar. 
This 
theory, 
too, 
received 
its 
substantial 
confirmation 
from 
the 
subsequent 
observations 
of 
V. 
Hensen. 
On 
the 
free 
surface 
of 
the 
bodies 
of 
Crustacea, 
connected 
with 
the 
auditory 
nerves, 
rows 
of 
little 
hairy 
filaments 
of 
varying 
lengths 
and 
thicknesses 
are 
found, 
which 
to 
some 
extent 
are 
the 
analogues 
of 
Corti's 
fibres. 
Hensen 
saw 
these 
hairs 
vibrate 
when 
sounds 
were 
excited, 
and 
when 
different 
notes 
were 
struck 
different 
hairs 
were 
set 
in 
vibration. 


I 
have 
compared 
the 
work 
of 
the 
physical 
inquirer 
to 
the 
journey 
of 
the 
tourist. 
When 
the 
tourist 
ascends 
a 
new 
hill 
he 
obtains 
of 
the 
whole 
district 
a 
different 
view. 
When 
the 
inquirer 
has 
found 
the 
solution 
of 
one 
enigma, 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
host 
of 
others 
falls 
into 
his 
hands. 


Surely 
you 
have 
often 
felt 
the 
strange 
impression 
experienced 
when 
in 
singing 
through 
the 
scale 
the 
octave 
is 
reached, 
and 
nearly 
the 
same 
sensation 
is 
produced 
as 
by 
the 
fundamental 
tone. 
The 
phenomenon 
finds 
its 
explanation 
in 
the 
view 
here 
laid 
down 
of 
the 
ear. 
And 
not 
only 
this 
phenomenon 
but 
all 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
harmony 
may 
be 
grasped 
and 
verified 
from 
this 
point 
of 
view 
with 
a 
clearness 
before 
undreamt 
of. 
Unfortunately, 
I 
must 
content 
myself 
to-day 
with 
the 
simple 
indication 
of 
these 
beautiful 
prospects. 
Their 
consideration 
would 
lead 
us 
too 
far 
aside 
into 
the 
fields 
of 
other 
sciences. 


The 
searcher 
of 
nature, 
too, 
must 
restrain 
himself 
in 
his 
path. 
He 
also 
is 
drawn 
along 
from 
one 
beauty 
to 
another 
as 
the 
tourist 
from 
dale 
to 
dale, 
and 
as 
circumstances 
generally 
draw 
men 
from 
one 
condition 
of 
life 
into 
others. 
It 
is 
not 
he 
so 
much 
that 
makes 
the 
quests, 
as 
that 
the 
quests 
are 
made 
of 
him. 



Yet 
let 
him 
profit 
by 
his 
time, 
and 
let 
not 
his 
glance 
rove 
aimlessly 
hither 
and 
thither. 
For 
soon 
the 
evening 
sun 
will 
shine, 
and 
ere 
he 
has 
caught 
a 
full 
glimpse 
of 
the 
wonders 
close 
by, 
a 
mighty 
hand 
will 
seize 
him 
and 
lead 
him 
away 
into 
a 
different 
world 
of 
puzzles. 


Respected 
hearers, 
science 
once 
stood 
in 
an 
entirely 
different 
relation 
to 
poetry. 
The 
old 
Hindu 
mathematicians 
wrote 
their 
theorems 
in 
verses, 
and 
lotus-flowers, 
roses, 
and 
lilies, 
beautiful 
sceneries, 
lakes, 
and 
mountains 
figured 
in 
their 
problems. 


"Thou 
goest 
forth 
on 
this 
lake 
in 
a 
boat. 
A 
lily 
juts 
forth, 
one 
palm 
above 
the 
water. 
A 
breeze 
bends 
it 
downwards, 
and 
it 
vanishes 
two 
palms 
from 
its 
previous 
spot 
beneath 
the 
surface. 
Quick, 
mathematician, 
tell 
me 
how 
deep 
is 
the 
lake!" 


Thus 
spoke 
an 
ancient 
Hindu 
scholar. 
This 
poetry, 
and 
rightly, 
has 
disappeared 
from 
science, 
but 
from 
its 
dry 
leaves 
another 
poetry 
is 
wafted 
aloft 
which 
cannot 
be 
described 
to 
him 
who 
has 
never 
felt 
it. 
Whoever 
will 
fully 
enjoy 
this 
poetry 
must 
put 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
plough, 
must 
himself 
investigate. 
Therefore, 
enough 
of 
this! 
I 
shall 
reckon 
myself 
fortunate 
if 
you 
do 
not 
repent 
of 
this 
brief 
excursion 
into 
the 
flowered 
dale 
of 
physiology, 
and 
if 
you 
take 
with 
yourselves 
the 
belief 
that 
we 
can 
say 
of 
science 
what 
we 
say 
of 
poetry, 


"Who 
the 
song 
would 
understand, 


Needs 
must 
seek 
the 
song's 
own 
land; 


Who 
the 
minstrel 
understand 


Needs 
must 
seek 
the 
minstrel's 
land." 



ON 
THE 
CAUSES 
OF 
HARMONY. 


We 
are 
to 
speak 
to-day 
of 
a 
theme 
which 
is 
perhaps 
of 
somewhat 
more 
general 
interest—the 
causes 
of 
the 
harmony 
of 
musical 
sounds. 
The 
first 
and 
simplest 
experiences 
relative 
to 
harmony 
are 
very 
ancient. 
Not 
so 
the 
explanation 
of 
its 
laws. 
These 
were 
first 
supplied 
by 
the 
investigators 
of 
a 
recent 
epoch. 
Allow 
me 
an 
historical 
retrospect. 


Pythagoras 
(586 
B. 
C.) 
knew 
that 
the 
note 
yielded 
by 
a 
string 
of 
steady 
tension 
was 
converted 
into 
its 
octave 
when 
the 
length 
of 
the 
string 
was 
reduced 
one-half, 
and 
into 
its 
fifth 
when 
reduced 
two-thirds; 
and 
that 
then 
the 
first 
fundamental 
tone 
was 
consonant 
with 
the 
two 
others. 
He 
knew 
generally 
that 
the 
same 
string 
under 
fixed 
tension 
gives 
consonant 
tones 
when 
successively 
divided 
into 
lengths 
that 
are 
in 
the 
proportions 
of 
the 
simplest 
natural 
numbers; 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
proportions 
of 
1:2, 
2:3, 
3:4, 
4:5. 


Pythagoras 
failed 
to 
reveal 
the 
causes 
of 
these 
laws. 
What 
have 
consonant 
tones 
to 
do 
with 
the 
simple 
natural 
numbers? 
That 
is 
the 
question 
we 
should 
ask 
to-day. 
But 
this 
circumstance 
must 
have 
appeared 
less 
strange 
than 
inexplicable 
to 
Pythagoras. 
This 
philosopher 
sought 
for 
the 
causes 
of 
harmony 
in 
the 
occult, 
miraculous 
powers 
of 
numbers. 
His 
procedure 
was 
largely 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
upgrowth 
of 
a 
numerical 
mysticism, 
of 
which 
the 
traces 
may 
still 
be 
detected 
in 
our 
oneirocritical 
books 
and 
among 
some 
scientists, 
to 
whom 
marvels 
are 
more 
attractive 
than 
lucidity. 


Euclid 
(300 
B. 
C.) 
gives 
a 
definition 
of 
consonance 
and 
dissonance 
that 
could 
hardly 
be 
improved 
upon, 
in 
point 
of 
verbal 
accuracy. 
The 
consonance 
(συμφωνία) 
of 
two 
tones, 
he 
says, 
is 
the 
mixture, 
the 
blending 
(κρᾶσις) 
of 
those 
two 
tones; 
dissonance 
(διαφωνία), 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
the 
incapacity 
of 
the 
tones 
to 
blend 
(ἀμιξία), 
whereby 
they 
are 
made 
harsh 
for 
the 
ear. 
The 
person 
who 
knows 
the 
correct 
explanation 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
hears 
it, 
so 
to 
speak, 
reverberated 
in 
these 
words 
of 
Euclid. 
Still, 
Euclid 
did 
not 
know 
the 
true 
cause 
of 
harmony. 
He 
had 
unwittingly 
come 
very 
near 
to 
the 
truth, 
but 
without 
really 
grasping 
it. 



Leibnitz 
(1646-1716 
A. 
D.) 
resumed 
the 
question 
which 
his 
predecessors 
had 
left 
unsolved. 
He, 
of 
course, 
knew 
that 
musical 
notes 
were 
produced 
by 
vibrations, 
that 
twice 
as 
many 
vibrations 
corresponded 
to 
the 
octave 
as 
to 
the 
fundamental 
tone, 
etc. 
A 
passionate 
lover 
of 
mathematics, 
he 
sought 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
harmony 
in 
the 
secret 
computation 
and 
comparison 
of 
the 
simple 
numbers 
of 
vibrations 
and 
in 
the 
secret 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
soul 
at 
this 
occupation. 
But 
how, 
we 
ask, 
if 
one 
does 
not 
know 
that 
musical 
notes 
are 
vibrations? 
The 
computation 
and 
the 
satisfaction 
at 
the 
computation 
must 
indeed 
be 
pretty 
secret 
if 
it 
is 
unknown. 
What 
queer 
ideas 
philosophers 
have! 
Could 
anything 
more 
wearisome 
be 
imagined 
than 
computation 
as 
a 
principle 
of 
æsthetics? 
Yes, 
you 
are 
not 
utterly 
wrong 
in 
your 
conjecture, 
yet 
you 
may 
be 
sure 
that 
Leibnitz's 
theory 
is 
not 
wholly 
nonsense, 
although 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
make 
out 
precisely 
what 
he 
meant 
by 
his 
secret 
computation. 


The 
great 
Euler 
(1707-1783) 
sought 
the 
cause 
of 
harmony, 
almost 
as 
Leibnitz 
did, 
in 
the 
pleasure 
which 
the 
soul 
derives 
from 
the 
contemplation 
of 
order 
in 
the 
numbers 
of 
the 
vibrations. 
[10] 


Rameau 
and 
D'Alembert 
(1717-1783) 
approached 
nearer 
to 
the 
truth. 
They 
knew 
that 
in 
every 
sound 
available 
in 
music 
besides 
the 
fundamental 
note 
also 
the 
twelfth 
and 
the 
next 
higher 
third 
could 
be 
heard; 
and 
further 
that 
the 
resemblance 
between 
a 
fundamental 
tone 
and 
its 
octave 
was 
always 
strongly 
marked. 
Accordingly, 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
octave, 
fifth, 
third, 
etc., 
with 
the 
fundamental 
tone 
appeared 
to 
them 
"natural." 
They 
possessed, 
we 
must 
admit, 
the 
correct 
point 
of 
view; 
but 
with 
the 
simple 
naturalness 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
no 
inquirer 
can 
rest 
content; 
for 
it 
is 
precisely 
this 
naturalness 
for 
which 
he 
seeks 
his 
explanations. 


Rameau's 
remark 
dragged 
along 
through 
the 
whole 
modern 
period, 
but 
without 
leading 
to 
the 
full 
discovery 
of 
the 
truth. 
Marx 
places 
it 
at 
the 
head 
of 
his 
theory 
of 
composition, 
but 
makes 
no 
further 
application 
of 
it. 
Also 
Goethe 
and 
Zelter 
in 
their 
correspondence 
were, 
so 
to 
speak, 
on 
the 
brink 
of 
the 
truth. 
Zelter 
knew 
of 
Rameau's 
view. 
Finally, 
you 
will 
be 
appalled 
at 
the 
difficulty 
of 
the 
problem, 
when 
I 
tell 
you 
that 
till 
very 
recent 
times 
even 
professors 
of 
physics 
were 
dumb 
when 
asked 
what 
were 
the 
causes 
of 
harmony. 


Not 
till 
quite 
recently 
did 
Helmholtz 
find 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
question. 
But 
to 
make 
this 
solution 
clear 
to 
you 
I 
must 
first 
speak 
of 
some 
experimental 



principles 
of 
physics 
and 
psychology. 


1) 
In 
every 
process 
of 
perception, 
in 
every 
observation, 
the 
attention 
plays 
a 
highly 
important 
part. 
We 
need 
not 
look 
about 
us 
long 
for 
proofs 
of 
this. 
You 
receive, 
for 
example, 
a 
letter 
written 
in 
a 
very 
poor 
hand. 
Do 
your 
best, 
you 
cannot 
make 
it 
out. 
You 
put 
together 
now 
these, 
now 
those 
lines, 
yet 
you 
cannot 
construct 
from 
them 
a 
single 
intelligible 
character. 
Not 
until 
you 
direct 
your 
attention 
to 
groups 
of 
lines 
which 
really 
belong 
together, 
is 
the 
reading 
of 
the 
letter 
possible. 
Manuscripts, 
the 
letters 
of 
which 
are 
formed 
of 
minute 
figures 
and 
scrolls, 
can 
only 
be 
read 
at 
a 
considerable 
distance, 
where 
the 
attention 
is 
no 
longer 
diverted 
from 
the 
significant 
outlines 
to 
the 
details. 
A 
beautiful 
example 
of 
this 
class 
is 
furnished 
by 
the 
famous 
iconographs 
of 
Giuseppe 
Arcimboldo 
in 
the 
basement 
of 
the 
Belvedere 
gallery 
at 
Vienna. 
These 
are 
symbolic 
representations 
of 
water, 
fire, 
etc.: 
human 
heads 
composed 
of 
aquatic 
animals 
and 
of 
combustibles. 
At 
a 
short 
distance 
one 
sees 
only 
the 
details, 
at 
a 
greater 
distance 
only 
the 
whole 
figure. 
Yet 
a 
point 
can 
be 
easily 
found 
at 
which, 
by 
a 
simple 
voluntary 
movement 
of 
the 
attention, 
there 
is 
no 
difficulty 
in 
seeing 
now 
the 
whole 
figure 
and 
now 
the 
smaller 
forms 
of 
which 
it 
is 
composed. 
A 
picture 
is 
often 
seen 
representing 
the 
tomb 
of 
Napoleon. 
The 
tomb 
is 
surrounded 
by 
dark 
trees 
between 
which 
the 
bright 
heavens 
are 
visible 
as 
background. 
One 
can 
look 
a 
long 
time 
at 
this 
picture 
without 
noticing 
anything 
except 
the 
trees, 
but 
suddenly, 
on 
the 
attention 
being 
accidentally 
directed 
to 
the 
bright 
background, 
one 
sees 
the 
figure 
of 
Napoleon 
between 
the 
trees. 
This 
case 
shows 
us 
very 
distinctly 
the 
important 
part 
which 
attention 
plays. 
The 
same 
sensuous 
object 
can, 
solely 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
attention, 
give 
rise 
to 
wholly 
different 
perceptions. 
If 
I 
strike 
a 
harmony, 
or 
chord, 
on 
this 
piano, 
by 
a 
mere 
effort 
of 
attention 
you 
can 
fix 
every 
tone 
of 
that 
harmony. 
You 
then 
hear 
most 
distinctly 
the 
fixed 
tone, 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
appear 
as 
a 
mere 
addition, 
altering 
only 
the 
quality, 
or 
acoustic 
color, 
of 
the 
primary 
tone. 
The 
effect 
of 
the 
same 
harmony 
is 
essentially 
modified 
if 
we 
direct 
our 
attention 
to 
different 
tones. 


Strike 
in 
succession 
two 
harmonies, 
for 
example, 
the 
two 
represented 
in 
the 
annexed 
diagram, 
and 
first 
fix 
by 
the 
attention 
the 
upper 
note 
e, 
afterwards 
the 
base 
e-a; 
in 
the 
two 
cases 
you 
will 
hear 
the 
same 
sequence 
of 
harmonies 
differently. 
In 
the 
first 
case, 
you 
have 
the 
impression 
as 
if 
the 
fixed 
tone 



remained 
unchanged 
and 
simply 
altered 
its 
timbre; 
in 
the 
second 
case, 
the 
whole 
acoustic 
agglomeration 
seems 
to 
fall 
sensibly 
in 
depth. 
There 
is 
an 
art 
of 
composition 
to 
guide 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
hearer. 
But 
there 
is 
also 
an 
art 
of 
hearing, 
which 
is 
not 
the 
gift 
of 
every 
person. 


The 
piano-player 
knows 
the 
remarkable 
effects 
obtained 
when 
one 
of 
the 
keys 
of 
a 
chord 
that 
is 
struck 
is 
let 
loose. 
Bar 
1 
played 
on 
the 
piano 
sounds 
almost 
like 
bar 
2. 
The 
note 
which 
lies 
next 
to 
the 
key 
let 
loose 
resounds 
after 
its 
release 
as 
if 
it 
were 
freshly 
struck. 
The 
attention 
no 
longer 
occupied 
with 
the 
upper 
note 
is 
by 
that 
very 
fact 
insensibly 
led 
to 
the 
upper 
note. 


Any 
tolerably 
cultivated 
musical 
ear 
can 
perform 
the 
resolution 
of 
a 
harmony 
into 
its 
component 
parts. 
By 
much 
practice 
we 
can 
go 
even 
further. 
Then, 
every 
musical 
sound 
heretofore 
regarded 
as 
simple 
can 
be 
resolved 
into 
a 
subordinate 
succession 
of 
musical 
tones. 
For 
example, 
if 
I 
strike 
on 
the 
piano 
the 
note 
1, 
(annexed 
diagram,) 
we 
shall 
hear, 
if 
we 
make 
the 
requisite 
effort 
of 
attention, 
besides 
the 
loud 
fundamental 
note 
the 
feebler, 
higher 
overtones, 
or 
harmonics, 
2 
... 
7, 
that 
is, 
the 
octave, 
the 
twelfth, 
the 
double 
octave, 
and 
the 
third, 
the 
fifth, 
and 
the 
seventh 
of 
the 
double 
octave. 


The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
every 
musically 
available 
sound. 
Each 
yields, 
with 
varying 
degrees 
of 
intensity, 
besides 
its 
fundamental 
note, 
also 
the 
octave, 
the 
twelfth, 
the 
double 
octave, 
etc. 
The 
phenomenon 
is 
observable 
with 
special 
facility 
on 
the 
open 
and 
closed 
flue-pipes 
of 
organs. 
According, 
now, 
as 
certain 
overtones 
are 
more 
or 
less 
distinctly 
emphasised 
in 
a 
sound, 
the 
timbre 
of 
the 
sound 
changes—that 
peculiar 
quality 
of 
the 
sound 
by 
which 
we 
distinguish 
the 
music 
of 
the 
piano 
from 
that 
of 
the 
violin, 
the 
clarinet, 
etc. 


On 
the 
piano 
these 
overtones 
can 
be 
very 
easily 
rendered 
audible. 
If 
I 
strike, 
for 
example, 
sharply 
note 
1 
of 
the 
foregoing 
series, 
whilst 
I 
simply 
press 
down 
upon, 
one 
after 
another, 
the 
keys 
2, 
3, 
... 
7, 
the 
notes 
2, 
3, 
... 
7 
will 
continue 
to 
sound 
after 
the 
striking 
of 
1, 
because 
the 
strings 
corresponding 
to 
these 
notes, 
now 
freed 
from 
their 
dampers, 
are 
thrown 
into 
sympathetic 
vibration. 


As 
you 
know, 
this 
sympathetic 
vibration 
of 
the 
like-pitched 
strings 
with 
the 
overtones 
is 
really 
not 
to 
be 
conceived 
as 
sympathy, 
but 
rather 
as 
lifeless 
mechanical 
necessity. 
We 
must 
not 
think 
of 
this 
sympathetic 
vibration 
as 
an 



ingenious 
journalist 
pictured 
it, 
who 
tells 
a 
gruesome 
story 
of 
Beethoven's 
F 
minor 
sonata, 
Op. 
2, 
that 
I 
cannot 
withhold 
from 
you. 
"At 
the 
last 
London 
Industrial 
Exhibition 
nineteen 
virtuosos 
played 
the 
F 
minor 
sonata 
on 
the 
same 
piano. 
When 
the 
twentieth 
stepped 
up 
to 
the 
instrument 
to 
play 
by 
way 
of 
variation 
the 
same 
production, 
to 
the 
terror 
of 
all 
present 
the 
piano 
began 
to 
render 
the 
sonata 
of 
its 
own 
accord. 
The 
Archbishop 
of 
Canterbury, 
who 
happened 
to 
be 
present, 
was 
set 
to 
work 
and 
forthwith 
expelled 
the 
F 
minor 
devil." 


Although, 
now, 
the 
overtones 
or 
harmonics 
which 
we 
have 
discussed 
are 
heard 
only 
upon 
a 
special 
effort 
of 
the 
attention, 
nevertheless 
they 
play 
a 
highly 
important 
part 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
musical 
timbre, 
as 
also 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
consonance 
and 
dissonance 
of 
sounds. 
This 
may 
strike 
you 
as 
singular. 
How 
can 
a 
thing 
which 
is 
heard 
only 
under 
exceptional 
circumstances 
be 
of 
importance 
generally 
for 
audition? 


But 
consider 
some 
familiar 
incidents 
of 
your 
every-day 
life. 
Think 
of 
how 
many 
things 
you 
see 
which 
you 
do 
not 
notice, 
which 
never 
strike 
your 
attention 
until 
they 
are 
missing. 
A 
friend 
calls 
upon 
you; 
you 
cannot 
understand 
why 
he 
looks 
so 
changed. 
Not 
until 
you 
make 
a 
close 
examination 
do 
you 
discover 
that 
his 
hair 
has 
been 
cut. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
tell 
the 
publisher 
of 
a 
work 
from 
its 
letter-press, 
and 
yet 
no 
one 
can 
state 
precisely 
the 
points 
by 
which 
this 
style 
of 
type 
is 
so 
strikingly 
different 
from 
that 
style. 
I 
have 
often 
recognised 
a 
book 
which 
I 
was 
in 
search 
of 
from 
a 
simple 
piece 
of 
unprinted 
white 
paper 
that 
peeped 
out 
from 
underneath 
the 
heap 
of 
books 
covering 
it, 
and 
yet 
I 
had 
never 
carefully 
examined 
the 
paper, 
nor 
could 
I 
have 
stated 
its 
difference 
from 
other 
papers. 


What 
we 
must 
remember, 
therefore, 
is 
that 
every 
sound 
that 
is 
musically 
available 
yields, 
besides 
its 
fundamental 
note, 
its 
octave, 
its 
twelfth, 
its 
double 
octave, 
etc., 
as 
overtones 
or 
harmonics, 
and 
that 
these 
are 
important 
for 
the 
agreeable 
combination 
of 
several 
musical 
sounds. 


2) 
One 
other 
fact 
still 
remains 
to 
be 
dealt 
with. 
Look 
at 
this 
tuning-fork. 
It 
yields, 
when 
struck, 
a 
perfectly 
smooth 
tone. 
But 
if 
you 
strike 
in 
company 
with 
it 
a 
second 
fork 
which 
is 
of 
slightly 
different 
pitch, 
and 
which 
alone 
also 
gives 
a 
perfectly 
smooth 
tone, 
you 
will 
hear, 
if 
you 
set 
both 
forks 
on 
the 
table, 
or 
hold 
both 
before 
your 
ear, 
a 
uniform 
tone 
no 
longer, 
but 
a 
number 
of 

shocks 
of 
tones. 
The 
rapidity 
of 
the 
shocks 
increases 
with 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
pitch 
of 
the 
forks. 
These 
shocks, 
which 
become 
very 
disagreeable 
for 
the 
ear 
when 
they 
amount 
to 
thirty-three 
in 
a 
second, 
are 
called 
"beats." 


Always, 
when 
one 
of 
two 
like 
musical 
sounds 
is 
thrown 
out 
of 
unison 
with 
the 
other, 
beats 
arise. 
Their 
number 
increases 
with 
the 
divergence 
from 
unison, 
and 
simultaneously 
they 
grow 
more 
unpleasant. 
Their 
roughness 
reaches 
its 
maximum 
at 
about 
thirty-three 
beats 
in 
a 
second. 
On 
a 
still 
further 
departure 
from 
unison, 
and 
a 
consequent 
increase 
of 
the 
number 
of 
beats, 
the 
unpleasant 
effect 
is 
diminished, 
so 
that 
tones 
which 
are 
widely 
apart 
in 
pitch 
no 
longer 
produce 
offensive 
beats. 


To 
give 
yourselves 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
the 
production 
of 
beats, 
take 
two 
metronomes 
and 
set 
them 
almost 
alike. 
You 
can, 
for 
that 
matter, 
set 
the 
two 
exactly 
alike. 
You 
need 
not 
fear 
that 
they 
will 
strike 
alike. 
The 
metronomes 
usually 
for 
sale 
in 
the 
shops 
are 
poor 
enough 
to 
yield, 
when 
set 
alike, 
appreciably 
unequal 
strokes. 
Set, 
now, 
these 
two 
metronomes, 
which 
strike 
at 
unequal 
intervals, 
in 
motion; 
you 
will 
readily 
see 
that 
their 
strokes 
alternately 
coincide 
and 
conflict 
with 
each 
other. 
The 
alternation 
is 
quicker 
the 
greater 
the 
difference 
of 
time 
of 
the 
two 
metronomes. 


If 
metronomes 
are 
not 
to 
be 
had, 
the 
experiment 
may 
be 
performed 
with 
two 
watches. 


Beats 
arise 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
The 
rhythmical 
shocks 
of 
two 
sounding 
bodies, 
of 
unequal 
pitch, 
sometimes 
coincide, 
sometimes 
interfere, 
whereby 
they 
alternately 
augment 
and 
enfeeble 
each 
other's 
effects. 
Hence 
the 
shock-like, 
unpleasant 
swelling 
of 
the 
tone. 


Now 
that 
we 
have 
made 
ourselves 
acquainted 
with 
overtones 
and 
beats, 
we 
may 
proceed 
to 
the 
answer 
of 
our 
main 
question, 
Why 
do 
certain 
relations 
of 
pitch 
produce 
pleasant 
sounds, 
consonances, 
others 
unpleasant 
sounds, 
dissonances? 
It 
will 
be 
readily 
seen 
that 
all 
the 
unpleasant 
effects 
of 
simultaneous 
sound-combinations 
are 
the 
result 
of 
beats 
produced 
by 
those 
combinations. 
Beats 
are 
the 
only 
sin, 
the 
sole 
evil 
of 
music. 
Consonance 
is 
the 
coalescence 
of 
sounds 
without 
appreciable 
beats. 


To 
make 
this 
perfectly 
clear 
to 
you 
I 
have 
constructed 
the 
model 
which 
you 



see 
in 
Fig. 
12. 
It 
represents 
a 
claviatur. 
At 
its 
top 
a 
movable 
strip 
of 
wood 
aa 
with 
the 
marks 
1, 
2 
... 
6 
is 
placed. 
By 
setting 
this 
strip 
in 
any 
position, 
for 
example, 
in 
that 
where 
the 
mark 
1 
is 
over 
the 
note 
c 
of 
the 
claviatur, 
the 
marks 
2, 
3 
... 
6, 
as 
you 
see, 
stand 
over 
the 
overtones 
of 
c. 
The 
same 
happens 
when 
the 
strip 
is 
placed 
in 
any 
other 
position. 
A 
second, 
exactly 
similar 
strip, 
bb, 
possesses 
the 
same 
properties. 
Thus, 
together, 
the 
two 
strips, 
in 
any 
two 
positions, 
point 
out 
by 
their 
marks 
all 
the 
tones 
brought 
into 
play 
upon 
the 
simultaneous 
sounding 
of 
the 
notes 
indicated 
by 
the 
marks 
1. 


The 
two 
strips, 
placed 
over 
the 
same 
fundamental 
note, 
show 
that 
also 
all 
the 
overtones 
of 
those 
notes 
coincide. 
The 
first 
note 
is 
simply 
intensified 
by 
the 
other. 
The 
single 
overtones 
of 
a 
sound 
lie 
too 
far 
apart 
to 
permit 
appreciable 
beats. 
The 
second 
sound 
supplies 
nothing 
new, 
consequently, 
also, 
no 
new 
beats. 
Unison 
is 
the 
most 
perfect 
consonance. 


Moving 
one 
of 
the 
two 
strips 
along 
the 
other 
is 
equivalent 
to 
a 
departure 
from 
unison. 
All 
the 
overtones 
of 
the 
one 
sound 
now 
fall 
alongside 
those 
of 
the 
other; 
beats 
are 
at 
once 
produced; 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
tones 
becomes 
unpleasant: 
we 
obtain 
a 
dissonance. 
If 
we 
move 
the 
strip 
further 
and 
further 
along, 
we 
shall 
find 
that 
as 
a 
general 
rule 
the 
overtones 
always 
fall 
alongside 
each 
other, 
that 
is, 
always 
produce 
beats 
and 
dissonances. 
Only 
in 
a 
few 
quite 
definite 
positions 
do 
the 
overtones 
partially 
coincide. 
Such 
positions, 
therefore, 
signify 
higher 
degrees 
of 
euphony—they 
point 
out 
the 
consonant 
intervals. 


These 
consonant 
intervals 
can 
be 
readily 
found 
experimentally 
by 
cutting 
Fig. 
12 
out 
of 
paper 
and 
moving 
bb 
lengthwise 
along 
aa. 
The 
most 
perfect 
consonances 
are 
the 
octave 
and 
the 
twelfth, 
since 
in 
these 
two 
cases 
the 
overtones 
of 
the 
one 
sound 
coincide 
absolutely 
with 
those 
of 
the 
other. 
In 
the 
octave, 
for 
example, 
1b 
falls 
on 
2a,2b 
on 
4a,3b 
on 
6a. 
Consonances, 
therefore, 
are 
simultaneous 
sound-combinations 
not 
accompanied 
by 
disagreeable 
beats. 
This, 
by 
the 
way, 
is, 
expressed 
in 
English, 
what 
Euclid 
said 
in 
Greek. 


Only 
such 
sounds 
are 
consonant 
as 
possess 
in 
common 
some 
portion 
of 
their 
partial 
tones. 
Plainly 
we 
must 
recognise 
between 
such 
sounds, 
also 
when 
struck 
one 
after 
another, 
a 
certain 
affinity. 
For 
the 
second 
sound, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
common 
overtones, 
will 
produce 
partly 
the 
same 
sensation 
as 
the 
first. 



The 
octave 
is 
the 
most 
striking 
exemplification 
of 
this. 
When 
we 
reach 
the 
octave 
in 
the 
ascent 
of 
the 
scale 
we 
actually 
fancy 
we 
hear 
the 
fundamental 
tone 
repeated. 
The 
foundations 
of 
harmony, 
therefore, 
are 
the 
foundations 
of 
melody. 


Consonance 
is 
the 
coalescence 
of 
sounds 
without 
appreciable 
beats! 
This 
principle 
is 
competent 
to 
introduce 
wonderful 
order 
and 
logic 
into 
the 
doctrines 
of 
the 
fundamental 
bass. 
The 
compendiums 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
harmony 
which 
(Heaven 
be 
witness!) 
have 
stood 
hitherto 
little 
behind 
the 
cook-books 
in 
subtlety 
of 
logic, 
are 
rendered 
extraordinarily 
clear 
and 
simple. 
And 
what 
is 
more, 
all 
that 
the 
great 
masters, 
such 
as 
Palestrina, 
Mozart, 
Beethoven, 
unconsciously 
got 
right, 
and 
of 
which 
heretofore 
no 
text-book 
could 
render 
just 
account, 
receives 
from 
the 
preceding 
principle 
its 
perfect 
verification. 


But 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
theory 
is, 
that 
it 
bears 
upon 
its 
face 
the 
stamp 
of 
truth. 
It 
is 
no 
phantom 
of 
the 
brain. 
Every 
musician 
can 
hear 
for 
himself 
the 
beats 
which 
the 
overtones 
of 
his 
musical 
sounds 
produce. 
Every 
musician 
can 
satisfy 
himself 
that 
for 
any 
given 
case 
the 
number 
and 
the 
harshness 
of 
the 
beats 
can 
be 
calculated 
beforehand, 
and 
that 
they 
occur 
in 
exactly 
the 
measure 
that 
theory 
determines. 


This 
is 
the 
answer 
which 
Helmholtz 
gave 
to 
the 
question 
of 
Pythagoras, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
can 
be 
explained 
with 
the 
means 
now 
at 
my 
command. 
A 
long 
period 
of 
time 
lies 
between 
the 
raising 
and 
the 
solving 
of 
this 
question. 
More 
than 
once 
were 
eminent 
inquirers 
nearer 
to 
the 
answer 
than 
they 
dreamed 
of. 


The 
inquirer 
seeks 
the 
truth. 
I 
do 
not 
know 
if 
the 
truth 
seeks 
the 
inquirer. 
But 
were 
that 
so, 
then 
the 
history 
of 
science 
would 
vividly 
remind 
us 
of 
that 
classical 
rendezvous, 
so 
often 
immortalised 
by 
painters 
and 
poets. 
A 
high 
garden 
wall. 
At 
the 
right 
a 
youth, 
at 
the 
left 
a 
maiden. 
The 
youth 
sighs, 
the 
maiden 
sighs! 
Both 
wait. 
Neither 
dreams 
how 
near 
the 
other 
is. 


I 
like 
this 
simile. 
Truth 
suffers 
herself 
to 
be 
courted, 
but 
she 
has 
evidently 
no 
desire 
to 
be 
won. 
She 
flirts 
at 
times 
disgracefully. 
Above 
all, 
she 
is 
determined 
to 
be 
merited, 
and 
has 
naught 
but 
contempt 
for 
the 
man 
who 
will 
win 
her 
too 
quickly. 
And 
if, 
forsooth, 
one 
breaks 
his 
head 
in 
his 
efforts 
of 
conquest, 
what 
matter 
is 
it, 
another 
will 
come, 
and 
truth 
is 
always 
young. 
At 



times, 
indeed, 
it 
really 
seems 
as 
if 
she 
were 
well 
disposed 
towards 
her 
admirer, 
but 
that 
admitted—never! 
Only 
when 
Truth 
is 
in 
exceptionally 
good 
spirits 
does 
she 
bestow 
upon 
her 
wooer 
a 
glance 
of 
encouragement. 
For, 
thinks 
Truth, 
if 
I 
do 
not 
do 
something, 
in 
the 
end 
the 
fellow 
will 
not 
seek 
me 
at 
all. 


This 
one 
fragment 
of 
truth, 
then, 
we 
have, 
and 
it 
shall 
never 
escape 
us. 
But 
when 
I 
reflect 
what 
it 
has 
cost 
in 
labor 
and 
in 
the 
lives 
of 
thinking 
men, 
how 
it 
painfully 
groped 
its 
way 
through 
centuries, 
a 
half-matured 
thought, 
before 
it 
became 
complete; 
when 
I 
reflect 
that 
it 
is 
the 
toil 
of 
more 
than 
two 
thousand 
years 
that 
speaks 
out 
of 
this 
unobtrusive 
model 
of 
mine, 
then, 
without 
dissimulation, 
I 
almost 
repent 
me 
of 
the 
jest 
I 
have 
made. 


And 
think 
of 
how 
much 
we 
still 
lack! 
When, 
several 
thousand 
years 
hence, 
boots, 
top-hats, 
hoops, 
pianos, 
and 
bass-viols 
are 
dug 
out 
of 
the 
earth, 
out 
of 
the 
newest 
alluvium 
as 
fossils 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century; 
when 
the 
scientists 
of 
that 
time 
shall 
pursue 
their 
studies 
both 
upon 
these 
wonderful 
structures 
and 
upon 
our 
modern 
Broadways, 
as 
we 
to-day 
make 
studies 
of 
the 
implements 
of 
the 
stone 
age 
and 
of 
the 
prehistoric 
lake-dwellings—then, 
too, 
perhaps, 
people 
will 
be 
unable 
to 
comprehend 
how 
we 
could 
come 
so 
near 
to 
many 
great 
truths 
without 
grasping 
them. 
And 
thus 
it 
is 
for 
all 
time 
the 
unsolved 
dissonance, 
for 
all 
time 
the 
troublesome 
seventh, 
that 
everywhere 
resounds 
in 
our 
ears; 
we 
feel, 
perhaps, 
that 
it 
will 
find 
its 
solution, 
but 
we 
shall 
never 
live 
to 
see 
the 
day 
of 
the 
pure 
triple 
accord, 
nor 
shall 
our 
remotest 
descendants. 


Ladies, 
if 
it 
is 
the 
sweet 
purpose 
of 
your 
life 
to 
sow 
confusion, 
it 
is 
the 
purpose 
of 
mine 
to 
be 
clear; 
and 
so 
I 
must 
confess 
to 
you 
a 
slight 
transgression 
that 
I 
have 
been 
guilty 
of. 
On 
one 
point 
I 
have 
told 
you 
an 
untruth. 
But 
you 
will 
pardon 
me 
this 
falsehood, 
if 
in 
full 
repentance 
I 
make 
it 
good. 
The 
model 
represented 
in 
Fig. 
12 
does 
not 
tell 
the 
whole 
truth, 
for 
it 
is 
based 
upon 
the 
so-called 
"even 
temperament" 
system 
of 
tuning. 
The 
overtones, 
however, 
of 
musical 
sounds 
are 
not 
tempered, 
but 
purely 
tuned. 
By 
means 
of 
this 
slight 
inexactness 
the 
model 
is 
made 
considerably 
simpler. 
In 
this 
form 
it 
is 
fully 
adequate 
for 
ordinary 
purposes, 
and 
no 
one 
who 
makes 
use 
of 
it 
in 
his 
studies 
need 
be 
in 
fear 
of 
appreciable 
error. 


If 
you 
should 
demand 
of 
me, 
however, 
the 
full 
truth, 
I 
could 
give 
you 
that 



only 
by 
the 
help 
of 
a 
mathematical 
formula. 
I 
should 
have 
to 
take 
the 
chalk 
into 
my 
hands 
and—think 
of 
it!—reckon 
in 
your 
presence. 
This 
you 
might 
take 
amiss. 
Nor 
shall 
it 
happen. 
I 
have 
resolved 
to 
do 
no 
more 
reckoning 
for 
to-day. 
I 
shall 
reckon 
now 
only 
upon 
your 
forbearance, 
and 
this 
you 
will 
surely 
not 
gainsay 
me 
when 
you 
reflect 
that 
I 
have 
made 
only 
a 
limited 
use 
of 
my 
privilege 
to 
weary 
you. 
I 
could 
have 
taken 
up 
much 
more 
of 
your 
time, 
and 
may, 
therefore, 
justly 
close 
with 
Lessing's 
epigram: 


"If 
thou 
hast 
found 
in 
all 
these 
pages 
naught 
that's 
worth 
the 
thanks, 
At 
least 
have 
gratitude 
for 
what 
I've 
spared 
thee." 



THE 
VELOCITY 
OF 
LIGHT. 


When 
a 
criminal 
judge 
has 
a 
right 
crafty 
knave 
before 
him, 
one 
well 
versed 
in 
the 
arts 
of 
prevarication, 
his 
main 
object 
is 
to 
wring 
a 
confession 
from 
the 
culprit 
by 
a 
few 
skilful 
questions. 
In 
almost 
a 
similar 
position 
the 
natural 
philosopher 
seems 
to 
be 
placed 
with 
respect 
to 
nature. 
True, 
his 
functions 
here 
are 
more 
those 
of 
the 
spy 
than 
the 
judge; 
but 
his 
object 
remains 
pretty 
much 
the 
same. 
Her 
hidden 
motives 
and 
laws 
of 
action 
is 
what 
nature 
must 
be 
made 
to 
confess. 
Whether 
a 
confession 
will 
be 
extracted 
depends 
upon 
the 
shrewdness 
of 
the 
inquirer. 
Not 
without 
reason, 
therefore, 
did 
Lord 
Bacon 
call 
the 
experimental 
method 
a 
questioning 
of 
nature. 
The 
art 
consists 
in 
so 
putting 
our 
questions 
that 
they 
may 
not 
remain 
unanswered 
without 
a 
breach 
of 
etiquette. 


Look, 
too, 
at 
the 
countless 
tools, 
engines, 
and 
instruments 
of 
torture 
with 
which 
man 
conducts 
his 
inquisitions 
of 
nature, 
and 
which 
mock 
the 
poet's 
words: 


"Mysterious 
even 
in 
open 
day, 


Nature 
retains 
her 
veil, 
despite 
our 
clamors; 


That 
which 
she 
doth 
not 
willingly 
display 


Cannot 
be 
wrenched 
from 
her 
with 
levers, 
screws, 
and 


hammers." 


Look 
at 
these 
instruments 
and 
you 
will 
see 
that 
the 
comparison 
with 
torture 
also 
is 
admissible. 
[11] 


This 
view 
of 
nature, 
as 
of 
something 
designedly 
concealed 
from 
man, 
that 
can 
be 
unveiled 
only 
by 
force 
or 
dishonesty, 
chimed 
in 
better 
with 
the 
conceptions 
of 
the 
ancients 
than 
with 
modern 
notions. 
A 
Grecian 
philosopher 
once 
said, 
in 
offering 
his 
opinion 
of 
the 
natural 
science 
of 
his 
time, 
that 
it 
could 
only 
be 
displeasing 
to 
the 
gods 
to 
see 
men 
endeavoring 
to 
spy 
out 
what 
the 
gods 
were 
not 
minded 
to 
reveal 
to 
them. 
[12] 
Of 
course 
all 
the 
contemporaries 
of 
the 
speaker 
were 
not 
of 
his 
opinion. 



Traces 
of 
this 
view 
may 
still 
be 
found 
to-day, 
but 
upon 
the 
whole 
we 
are 
now 
not 
so 
narrow-minded. 
We 
believe 
no 
longer 
that 
nature 
designedly 
hides 
herself. 
We 
know 
now 
from 
the 
history 
of 
science 
that 
our 
questions 
are 
sometimes 
meaningless, 
and 
that, 
therefore, 
no 
answer 
can 
be 
forthcoming. 
Soon 
we 
shall 
see 
how 
man, 
with 
all 
his 
thoughts 
and 
quests, 
is 
only 
a 
fragment 
of 
nature's 
life. 


Picture, 
then, 
as 
your 
fancy 
dictates, 
the 
tools 
of 
the 
physicist 
as 
instruments 
of 
torture 
or 
as 
engines 
of 
endearment, 
at 
all 
events 
a 
chapter 
from 
the 
history 
of 
those 
implements 
will 
be 
of 
interest 
to 
you, 
and 
it 
will 
not 
be 
unpleasant 
to 
learn 
what 
were 
the 
peculiar 
difficulties 
that 
led 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
such 
strange 
apparatus. 


Galileo 
(born 
at 
Pisa 
in 
1564, 
died 
at 
Arcetri 
in 
1642) 
was 
the 
first 
who 
asked 
what 
was 
the 
velocity 
of 
light, 
that 
is, 
what 
time 
it 
would 
take 
for 
a 
light 
struck 
at 
one 
place 
to 
become 
visible 
at 
another, 
a 
certain 
distance 
away. 
[13] 


The 
method 
which 
Galileo 
devised 
was 
as 
simple 
as 
it 
was 
natural. 
Two 
practised 
observers, 
with 
muffled 
lanterns, 
were 
to 
take 
up 
positions 
in 
a 
dark 
night 
at 
a 
considerable 
distance 
from 
each 
other, 
one 
at 
A 
and 
one 
at 
B. 
At 
a 
moment 
previously 
fixed 
upon, 
A 
was 
instructed 
to 
unmask 
his 
lantern; 
while 
as 
soon 
as 
B 
saw 
the 
light 
of 
A's 
lantern 
he 
was 
to 
unmask 
his. 
Now 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
time 
which 
A 
counted 
from 
the 
uncovering 
of 
his 
lantern 
until 
he 
caught 
sight 
of 
the 
light 
of 
B's 
would 
be 
the 
time 
which 
it 
would 
take 
light 
to 
travel 
from 
A 
to 
B 
and 
from 
B 
back 
to 
A. 


The 
experiment 
was 
not 
executed, 
nor 
could 
it, 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
case, 
have 
been 
a 
success. 
As 
we 
now 
know, 
light 
travels 
too 
rapidly 
to 
be 
thus 
noted. 
The 
time 
elapsing 
between 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
light 
at 
B 
and 
its 
perception 
by 
the 
observer, 
with 
that 
between 
the 
decision 
to 
uncover 
and 
the 
uncovering 
of 
the 
lantern, 
is, 
as 
we 
now 
know, 
incomparably 
greater 
than 
the 
time 
which 
it 
takes 
light 
to 
travel 
the 
greatest 
earthly 
distances. 
The 
great 
velocity 
of 
light 
will 
be 
made 
apparent, 
if 
we 
reflect 
that 
a 
flash 
of 
lightning 
in 
the 
night 
illuminates 
instantaneously 
a 
very 
extensive 
region, 
whilst 
the 
single 
reflected 
claps 
of 
thunder 
arrive 
at 
the 
observer's 
ear 
very 
gradually 
and 
in 
appreciable 
succession. 


During 
his 
life, 
then, 
the 
efforts 
of 
Galileo 
to 
determine 
the 
velocity 
of 
light 



remained 
uncrowned 
with 
success. 
But 
the 
subsequent 
history 
of 
the 
measurement 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
light 
is 
intimately 
associated 
with 
his 
name, 
for 
with 
the 
telescope 
which 
he 
constructed 
he 
discovered 
the 
four 
satellites 
of 
Jupiter, 
and 
these 
furnished 
the 
next 
occasion 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
light. 


The 
terrestrial 
spaces 
were 
too 
small 
for 
Galileo's 
experiment. 
The 
measurement 
was 
first 
executed 
when 
the 
spaces 
of 
the 
planetary 
system 
were 
employed. 
Olaf 
Römer, 
(born 
at 
Aarhuus 
in 
1644, 
died 
at 
Copenhagen 
in 
1710) 
accomplished 
the 
feat 
(1675-1676), 
while 
watching 
with 
Cassini 
at 
the 
observatory 
of 
Paris 
the 
revolutions 
of 
Jupiter's 
moons. 


Let 
AB 
(Fig. 
14) 
be 
Jupiter's 
orbit. 
Let 
S 
stand 
for 
the 
sun, 
E 
for 
the 
earth, 
J 
for 
Jupiter, 
and 
T 
for 
Jupiter's 
first 
satellite. 
When 
the 
earth 
is 
at 
E 
1 
we 
see 
the 
satellite 
enter 
regularly 
into 
Jupiter's 
shadow, 
and 
by 
watching 
the 
time 
between 
two 
successive 
eclipses, 
can 
calculate 
its 
time 
of 
revolution. 
The 
time 
which 
Römer 
noted 
was 
forty-two 
hours, 
twenty-eight 
minutes, 
and 
thirty-five 
seconds. 
Now, 
as 
the 
earth 
passes 
along 
in 
its 
orbit 
towards 
E2, 
the 
revolutions 
of 
the 
satellite 
grow 
apparently 
longer 
and 
longer: 
the 
eclipses 
take 
place 
later 
and 
later. 
The 
greatest 
retardation 
of 
the 
eclipse, 
which 
occurs 
when 
the 
earth 
is 
at 
E 
2, 
amounts 
to 
sixteen 
minutes 
and 
twenty-six 
seconds. 
As 
the 
earth 
passes 
back 
again 
to 
E 
1, 
the 
revolutions 
grow 
apparently 
shorter, 
and 
they 
occur 
in 
exactly 
the 
time 
that 
they 
first 
did 
when 
the 
earth 
arrives 
at 
E 
1. 
It 
is 
to 
be 
remarked 
that 
Jupiter 
changes 
only 
very 
slightly 
its 
position 
during 
one 
revolution 
of 
the 
earth. 
Römer 
guessed 
at 
once 
that 
these 


periodical 
changes 
of 
the 
time 
of 
revolution 
of 
Jupiter's 
satellite 
were 
not 
actual, 
but 
apparent 
changes, 
which 
were 
in 
some 
way 
connected 
with 
the 
velocity 
of 
light. 


Let 
us 
make 
this 
matter 
clear 
to 
ourselves 
by 
a 
simile. 
We 
receive 
regularly 
by 
the 
post, 
news 
of 
the 
political 
status 
at 
our 
capital. 
However 
far 
away 
we 
may 
be 
from 
the 
capital, 
we 
hear 
the 
news 
of 
every 
event, 
later 
it 
is 
true, 
but 
of 
all 
equally 
late. 
The 
events 
reach 
us 
in 
the 
same 
succession 
of 
time 
as 
that 
in 
which 
they 
took 
place. 
But 
if 
we 
are 
travelling 
away 
from 
the 
capital, 
every 
successive 
post 
will 
have 
a 
greater 
distance 
to 
pass 
over, 
and 
the 
events 
will 
reach 
us 
more 
slowly 
than 
they 
took 
place. 
The 
reverse 
will 
be 
the 
case 
if 
we 
are 
approaching 
the 
capital. 



At 
rest, 
we 
hear 
a 
piece 
of 
music 
played 
in 
the 
same 
tempo 
at 
all 
distances. 
But 
the 
tempo 
will 
be 
seemingly 
accelerated 
if 
we 
are 
carried 
rapidly 
towards 
the 
band, 
or 
retarded 
if 
we 
are 
carried 
rapidly 
away 
from 
it. 
[14] 


Picture 
to 
yourself 
a 
cross, 
say 
the 
sails 
of 
a 
wind-mill 
(Fig. 
15), 
in 
uniform 
rotation 
about 
its 
centre. 
Clearly, 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
cross 
will 
appear 
to 
you 
more 
slowly 
executed 
if 
you 
are 
carried 
very 
rapidly 
away 
from 
it. 
For 
the 
post 
which 
in 
this 
case 
conveys 
to 
you 
the 
light 
and 
brings 
to 
you 
the 
news 
of 
the 
successive 
positions 
of 
the 
cross 
will 
have 
to 
travel 
in 
each 
successive 
instant 
over 
a 
longer 
path. 


Now 
this 
must 
also 
be 
the 
case 
with 
the 
rotation 
(the 
revolution) 
of 
the 
satellite 
of 
Jupiter. 
The 
greatest 
retardation 
of 
the 
eclipse 
(16-1/2 
minutes), 
due 
to 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
earth 
from 
E 
1 
to 
E 
2, 
or 
to 
its 
removal 
from 
Jupiter 


by 
a 
distance 
equal 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
orbit 
of 
the 
earth, 
plainly 
corresponds 
to 
the 
time 
which 
it 
takes 
light 
to 
traverse 
a 
distance 
equal 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
earth's 
orbit. 
The 
velocity 
of 
light, 
that 
is, 
the 
distance 
described 
by 
light 
in 
a 
second, 
as 
determined 
by 
this 
calculation, 
is 
311,000 
kilometres, 
[15] 
or 
193,000 
miles. 
A 
subsequent 
correction 
of 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
earth's 
orbit, 
gives, 
by 
the 
same 
method, 
the 
velocity 
of 
light 
as 
approximately 
186,000 
miles 
a 
second. 


The 
method 
is 
exactly 
that 
of 
Galileo; 
only 
better 
conditions 
are 
selected. 
Instead 
of 
a 
short 
terrestrial 
distance 
we 
have 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
earth's 
orbit, 
three 
hundred 
and 
seven 
million 
kilometres; 
in 
place 
of 
the 
uncovered 
and 
covered 
lanterns 
we 
have 
the 
satellite 
of 
Jupiter, 
which 
alternately 
appears 
and 
disappears. 
Galileo, 
therefore, 
although 
he 
could 
not 
carry 
out 
himself 
the 
proposed 
measurement, 
found 
the 
lantern 
by 
which 
it 
was 
ultimately 
executed. 


Physicists 
did 
not 
long 
remain 
satisfied 
with 
this 
beautiful 
discovery. 
They 
sought 
after 
easier 
methods 
of 
measuring 
the 
velocity 
of 
light, 
such 
as 
might 
be 
performed 
on 
the 
earth. 
This 
was 
possible 
after 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
problem 
were 
clearly 
exposed. 
A 
measurement 
of 
the 
kind 
referred 
to 
was 
executed 
in 
1849 
by 
Fizeau 
(born 
at 
Paris 
in 
1819). 


I 
shall 
endeavor 
to 
make 
the 
principle 
of 
Fizeau's 
apparatus 
clear 
to 
you. 
Let 
s 



(Fig. 
16) 
be 
a 
disk 
free 
to 
rotate 
about 
its 
centre, 
and 
perforated 
at 
its 
rim 
with 
a 
series 
of 
holes. 
Let 
l 
be 
a 
luminous 
point 
casting 
its 
light 
on 
an 
unsilvered 
glass, 
a, 
inclined 
at 
an 
angle 
of 
forty-five 
degrees 
to 
the 
axis 
of 
the 
disk. 
The 
ray 
of 
light, 
reflected 
at 
this 
point, 
passes 
through 
one 
of 
the 
holes 
of 
the 
disk 
and 
falls 
at 
right 
angles 
upon 
a 
mirror 
b, 
erected 
at 
a 
point 
about 
five 
miles 
distant. 
From 
the 
mirror 
b 
the 
light 
is 
again 
reflected, 
passes 
once 
more 
through 
the 
hole 
in 
s, 
and, 
penetrating 
the 
glass 
plate, 
finally 
strikes 
the 
eye, 
o, 
of 
the 
observer. 
The 
eye, 
o, 
thus, 
sees 
the 
image 
of 
the 
luminous 
point 
l 
through 
the 
glass 
plate 
and 
the 
hole 
of 
the 
disk 
in 
the 
mirror 
b. 


If, 
now, 
the 
disk 
be 
set 
in 
rotation, 
the 
unpierced 
spaces 
between 
the 
apertures 
will 
alternately 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
apertures, 
and 
the 
eye 
o 
will 
now 
see 
the 
image 
of 
the 
luminous 
point 
in 
b 
only 
at 
interrupted 
intervals. 
On 
increasing 
the 
rapidity 
of 
the 
rotation, 
however, 
the 
interruptions 
for 
the 
eye 
become 
again 
unnoticeable, 
and 
the 
eye 
sees 
the 
mirror 
b 
uniformly 
illuminated. 


But 
all 
this 
holds 
true 
only 
for 
relatively 
small 
velocities 
of 
the 
disk, 
when 
the 
light 
sent 
through 
an 
aperture 
in 
s 
to 
b 
on 
its 
return 
strikes 
the 
aperture 
at 
almost 
the 
same 
place 
and 
passes 
through 
it 
a 
second 
time. 
Conceive, 
now, 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
disk 
to 
be 
so 
increased 
that 
the 
light 
on 
its 
return 
finds 
before 
it 
an 
unpierced 
space 
instead 
of 
an 
aperture, 
it 
will 
then 
no 
longer 
be 
able 
to 
reach 
the 
eye. 
We 
then 
see 
the 
mirror 
b 
only 
when 
no 
light 
is 
emitted 
from 
it, 
but 
only 
when 
light 
is 
sent 
to 
it; 
it 
is 
covered 
when 
light 
comes 
from 
it. 
In 
this 
case, 
accordingly, 
the 
mirror 
will 
always 
appear 
dark. 


If 
the 
velocity 
of 
rotation 
at 
this 
point 
were 
still 
further 
increased, 
the 
light 
sent 
through 
one 
aperture 
could 
not, 
of 
course, 
on 
its 
return 
pass 
through 
the 
same 
aperture 
but 
might 
strike 
the 
next 
and 
reach 
the 
eye 
by 
that. 
Hence, 
by 
constantly 
increasing 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
rotation, 
the 
mirror 
b 
may 
be 
made 
to 
appear 
alternately 
bright 
and 
dark. 
Plainly, 
now, 
if 
we 
know 
the 
number 
of 
apertures 
of 
the 
disk, 
the 
number 
of 
rotations 
per 
second, 
and 
the 
distance 
sb, 
we 
can 
calculate 
the 
velocity 
of 
light. 
The 
result 
agrees 
with 
that 
obtained 
by 
Römer. 


The 
experiment 
is 
not 
quite 
as 
simple 
as 
my 
exposition 
might 
lead 
you 
to 
believe. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken 
that 
the 
light 
shall 
travel 
back 
and 
forth 
over 
the 
miles 
of 
distance 
sb 
and 
bs 
undispersed. 
This 
difficulty 
is 
obviated 
by 
means 



of 
telescopes. 


If 
we 
examine 
Fizeau's 
apparatus 
closely, 
we 
shall 
recognise 
in 
it 
an 
old 
acquaintance: 
the 
arrangement 
of 
Galileo's 
experiment. 
The 
luminous 
point 
l 
is 
the 
lantern 
A, 
while 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
perforated 
disk 
performs 
mechanically 
the 
uncovering 
and 
covering 
of 
the 
lantern. 
Instead 
of 
the 
unskilful 
observer 
B 
we 
have 
the 
mirror 
b, 
which 
is 
unfailingly 
illuminated 
the 
instant 
the 
light 
arrives 
from 
s. 
The 
disk 
s, 
by 
alternately 
transmitting 
and 
intercepting 
the 
reflected 
light, 
assists 
the 
observer 
o. 
Galileo's 
experiment 
is 
here 
executed, 
so 
to 
speak, 
countless 
times 
in 
a 
second, 
yet 
the 
total 
result 
admits 
of 
actual 
observation. 
If 
I 
might 
be 
pardoned 
the 
use 
of 
a 
phrase 
of 
Darwin's 
in 
this 
field, 
I 
should 
say 
that 
Fizeau's 
apparatus 
was 
the 
descendant 
of 
Galileo's 
lantern. 


A 
still 
more 
refined 
and 
delicate 
method 
for 
the 
measurement 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
light 
was 
employed 
by 
Foucault, 
but 
a 
description 
of 
it 
here 
would 
lead 
us 
too 
far 
from 
our 
subject. 


The 
measurement 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound 
is 
easily 
executed 
by 
the 
method 
of 
Galileo. 
It 
was 
unnecessary, 
therefore, 
for 
physicists 
to 
rack 
their 
brains 
further 
about 
the 
matter; 
but 
the 
idea 
which 
with 
light 
grew 
out 
of 
necessity 
was 
applied 
also 
in 
this 
field. 
Koenig 
of 
Paris 
constructs 
an 
apparatus 
for 
the 
measurement 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound 
which 
is 
closely 
allied 
to 
the 
method 
of 
Fizeau. 


The 
apparatus 
is 
very 
simple. 
It 
consists 
of 
two 
electrical 
clock-works 
which 
strike 
simultaneously, 
with 
perfect 
precision, 
tenths 
of 
seconds. 
If 
we 
place 
the 
two 
clock-works 
directly 
side 
by 
side, 
we 
hear 
their 
strokes 
simultaneously, 
wherever 
we 
stand. 
But 
if 
we 
take 
our 
stand 
by 
the 
side 
of 
one 
of 
the 
works 
and 
place 
the 
other 
at 
some 
distance 
from 
us, 
in 
general 
a 
coincidence 
of 
the 
strokes 
will 
now 
not 
be 
heard. 
The 
companion 
strokes 
of 
the 
remote 
clock-work 
arrive, 
as 
sound, 
later. 
The 
first 
stroke 
of 
the 
remote 
work 
is 
heard, 
for 
example, 
immediately 
after 
the 
first 
of 
the 
adjacent 
work, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
by 
increasing 
the 
distance 
we 
may 
produce 
again 
a 
coincidence 
of 
the 
strokes. 
For 
example, 
the 
first 
stroke 
of 
the 
remote 
work 
coincides 
with 
the 
second 
of 
the 
near 
work, 
the 
second 
of 
the 
remote 
work 
with 
the 
third 
of 
the 
near 
work, 
and 
so 
on. 
If, 
now, 
the 
works 
strike 
tenths 
of 
seconds 
and 
the 
distance 
between 
them 
is 
increased 
until 
the 
first 
coincidence 



is 
noted, 
plainly 
that 
distance 
is 
travelled 
over 
by 
the 
sound 
in 
a 
tenth 
of 
a 
second. 


We 
meet 
frequently 
the 
phenomenon 
here 
presented, 
that 
a 
thought 
which 
centuries 
of 
slow 
and 
painful 
endeavor 
are 
necessary 
to 
produce, 
when 
once 
developed, 
fairly 
thrives. 
It 
spreads 
and 
runs 
everywhere, 
even 
entering 
minds 
in 
which 
it 
could 
never 
have 
arisen. 
It 
simply 
cannot 
be 
eradicated. 


The 
determination 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
light 
is 
not 
the 
only 
case 
in 
which 
the 
direct 
perception 
of 
the 
senses 
is 
too 
slow 
and 
clumsy 
for 
use. 
The 
usual 
method 
of 
studying 
events 
too 
fleet 
for 
direct 
observation 
consists 
in 
putting 
into 
reciprocal 
action 
with 
them 
other 
events 
already 
known, 
the 
velocities 
of 
all 
of 
which 
are 
capable 
of 
comparison. 
The 
result 
is 
usually 
unmistakable, 
and 
susceptible 
of 
direct 
inference 
respecting 
the 
character 
of 
the 
event 
which 
is 
unknown. 
The 
velocity 
of 
electricity 
cannot 
be 
determined 
by 
direct 
observation. 
But 
it 
was 
ascertained 
by 
Wheatstone, 
simply 
by 
the 
expedient 
of 
watching 
an 
electric 
spark 
in 
a 
mirror 
rotating 
with 
tremendous 
known 
velocity. 


If 
we 
wave 
a 
staff 
irregularly 
hither 
and 
thither, 
simple 
observation 
cannot 
determine 
how 
quickly 
it 
moves 
at 
each 
point 
of 
its 
course. 
But 
let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
staff 
through 
holes 
in 
the 
rim 
of 
a 
rapidly 
rotating 
disk 
(Fig. 
17). 
We 
shall 
then 
see 
the 
moving 
staff 
only 
in 
certain 
positions, 
namely, 
when 
a 
hole 
passes 
in 
front 
of 
the 
eye. 
The 
single 
pictures 
of 
the 
staff 
remain 
for 
a 
time 
impressed 
upon 
the 
eye; 
we 
think 
we 
see 
several 
staffs, 
having 
some 
such 
disposition 
as 
that 
represented 
in 
Fig. 
18. 
If, 
now, 
the 
holes 
of 
the 
disk 
are 
equally 
far 
apart, 
and 
the 
disk 
is 
rotated 
with 
uniform 
velocity, 
we 
see 
clearly 
that 
the 
staff 
has 
moved 
slowly 
from 
a 
to 
b, 
more 
quickly 
from 
b 
to 
c, 
still 
more 
quickly 
from 
c 
to 
d, 
and 
with 
its 
greatest 
velocity 
from 
d 
to 
e. 


A 
jet 
of 
water 
flowing 
from 
an 
orifice 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
a 
vessel 
has 
the 
appearance 
of 
perfect 
quiet 
and 
uniformity, 
but 
if 
we 
illuminate 
it 
for 
a 
second, 
in 
a 
dark 
room, 
by 
means 
of 
an 
electric 
flash 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
the 
jet 
is 
composed 
of 
separate 
drops. 
By 
their 
quick 
descent 
the 
images 
of 
the 
drops 
are 
obliterated 
and 
the 
jet 
appears 
uniform. 
Let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
jet 
through 
the 
rotating 
disk. 
The 
disk 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
rotated 
so 
rapidly 
that 
while 
the 
second 
aperture 
passes 
into 
the 
place 
of 
the 
first, 
drop 
1 
falls 
into 
the 
place 
of 
2, 
2 
into 
the 
place 
of 
3, 
and 
so 
on. 
We 
see 
drops 
then 
always 
in 
the 
same 



places. 
The 
jet 
appears 
to 
be 
at 
rest. 
If 
we 
turn 
the 
disk 
a 
trifle 
more 
slowly, 
then 
while 
the 
second 
aperture 
passes 
into 
the 
place 
of 
the 
first, 
drop 
1 
will 
have 
fallen 
somewhat 
lower 
than 
2, 
2 
somewhat 
lower 
than 
3, 
etc. 
Through 
every 
successive 
aperture 
we 
shall 
see 
drops 
in 
successively 
lower 
positions. 
The 
jet 
will 
appear 
to 
be 
flowing 
slowly 
downwards. 


Now 
let 
us 
turn 
the 
disk 
more 
rapidly. 
Then 
while 
the 
second 
aperture 
is 
passing 
into 
the 
place 
of 
the 
first, 
drop 
1 
will 
not 
quite 
have 
reached 
the 
place 
of 
2, 
but 
will 
be 
found 
slightly 
above 
2, 
2 
slightly 
above 
3, 
etc. 
Through 
the 
successive 
apertures 
we 
shall 
see 
the 
drops 
at 
successively 
higher 
places. 
It 
will 
now 
look 
as 
if 
the 
jet 
were 
flowing 
upwards, 
as 
if 
the 
drops 
were 
rising 
from 
the 
lower 
vessel 
into 
the 
higher. 


You 
see, 
physics 
grows 
gradually 
more 
and 
more 
terrible. 
The 
physicist 
will 
soon 
have 
it 
in 
his 
power 
to 
play 
the 
part 
of 
the 
famous 
lobster 
chained 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
Lake 
of 
Mohrin, 
whose 
direful 
mission, 
if 
ever 
liberated, 
the 
poet 
Kopisch 
humorously 
describes 
as 
that 
of 
a 
reversal 
of 
all 
the 
events 
of 
the 
world; 
the 
rafters 
of 
houses 
become 
trees 
again, 
cows 
calves, 
honey 
flowers, 
chickens 
eggs, 
and 
the 
poet's 
own 
poem 
flows 
back 
into 
his 
inkstand. 


You 
will 
now 
allow 
me 
the 
privilege 
of 
a 
few 
general 
remarks. 
You 
have 
seen 
that 
the 
same 
principle 
often 
lies 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
large 
classes 
of 
apparatus 
designed 
for 
different 
purposes. 
Frequently 
it 
is 
some 
very 
unobtrusive 
idea 
which 
is 
productive 
of 
so 
much 
fruit 
and 
of 
such 
extensive 
transformations 
in 
physical 
technics. 
It 
is 
not 
otherwise 
here 
than 
in 
practical 
life. 


The 
wheel 
of 
a 
waggon 
appears 
to 
us 
a 
very 
simple 
and 
insignificant 
creation. 
But 
its 
inventor 
was 
certainly 
a 
man 
of 
genius. 
The 
round 
trunk 
of 
a 
tree 
perhaps 
first 
accidentally 
led 
to 
the 
observation 
of 
the 
ease 
with 
which 
a 
load 
can 
be 
moved 
on 
a 
roller. 
Now, 
the 
step 
from 
a 
simple 
supporting 
roller 
to 
a 
fixed 
roller, 
or 
wheel, 
appears 
a 
very 
easy 
one. 
At 
least 
it 
appears 
very 
easy 
to 
us 
who 
are 
accustomed 
from 
childhood 
up 
to 
the 
action 
of 
the 
wheel. 
But 
if 
we 
put 
ourselves 
vividly 
into 
the 
position 
of 
a 
man 
who 
never 
saw 
a 
wheel, 
but 
had 
to 
invent 
one, 
we 
shall 
begin 
to 
have 
some 
idea 
of 
its 
difficulties. 
Indeed, 
it 
is 
even 
doubtful 
whether 
a 
single 
man 
could 
have 
accomplished 
this 
feat, 
whether 
perhaps 
centuries 
were 
not 
necessary 
to 
form 
the 
first 
wheel 



from 
the 
primitive 
roller. 
[16] 


History 
does 
not 
name 
the 
progressive 
minds 
who 
constructed 
the 
first 
wheel; 
their 
time 
lies 
far 
back 
of 
the 
historic 
period. 
No 
scientific 
academy 
crowned 
their 
efforts, 
no 
society 
of 
engineers 
elected 
them 
honorary 
members. 
They 
still 
live 
only 
in 
the 
stupendous 
results 
which 
they 
called 
forth. 
Take 
from 
us 
the 
wheel, 
and 
little 
will 
remain 
of 
the 
arts 
and 
industries 
of 
modern 
life. 
All 
disappears. 
From 
the 
spinning-wheel 
to 
the 
spinning-mill, 
from 
the 
turning-
lathe 
to 
the 
rolling-mill, 
from 
the 
wheelbarrow 
to 
the 
railway 
train, 
all 
vanishes. 


In 
science 
the 
wheel 
is 
equally 
important. 
Whirling 
machines, 
as 
the 
simplest 
means 
of 
obtaining 
quick 
motions 
with 
inconsiderable 
changes 
of 
place, 
play 
a 
part 
in 
all 
branches 
of 
physics. 
You 
know 
Wheatstone's 
rotating 
mirror, 
Fizeau's 
wheel, 
Plateau's 
perforated 
rotating 
disks, 
etc. 
Almost 
the 
same 
principle 
lies 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
these 
apparatus. 
They 
differ 
from 
one 
another 
no 
more 
than 
the 
pen-knife 
differs, 
in 
the 
purposes 
it 
serves, 
from 
the 
knife 
of 
the 
anatomist 
or 
the 
knife 
of 
the 
vine-dresser. 
Almost 
the 
same 
might 
be 
said 
of 
the 
screw. 


It 
will 
now 
perhaps 
be 
clear 
to 
you 
that 
new 
thoughts 
do 
not 
spring 
up 
suddenly. 
Thoughts 
need 
their 
time 
to 
ripen, 
grow, 
and 
develop 
in, 
like 
every 
natural 
product; 
for 
man, 
with 
his 
thoughts, 
is 
also 
a 
part 
of 
nature. 


Slowly, 
gradually, 
and 
laboriously 
one 
thought 
is 
transformed 
into 
a 
different 
thought, 
as 
in 
all 
likelihood 
one 
animal 
species 
is 
gradually 
transformed 
into 
new 
species. 
Many 
ideas 
arise 
simultaneously. 
They 
fight 
the 
battle 
for 
existence 
not 
otherwise 
than 
do 
the 
Ichthyosaurus, 
the 
Brahman, 
and 
the 
horse. 


A 
few 
remain 
to 
spread 
rapidly 
over 
all 
fields 
of 
knowledge, 
to 
be 
redeveloped, 
to 
be 
again 
split 
up, 
to 
begin 
again 
the 
struggle 
from 
the 
start. 
As 
many 
animal 
species 
long 
since 
conquered, 
the 
relicts 
of 
ages 
past, 
still 
live 
in 
remote 
regions 
where 
their 
enemies 
cannot 
reach 
them, 
so 
also 
we 
find 
conquered 
ideas 
still 
living 
on 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
many 
men. 
Whoever 
will 
look 
carefully 
into 
his 
own 
soul 
will 
acknowledge 
that 
thoughts 
battle 
as 
obstinately 
for 
existence 
as 
animals. 
Who 
will 
gainsay 
that 
many 
vanquished 
modes 
of 
thought 
still 
haunt 
obscure 
crannies 
of 
his 
brain, 
too 
faint-hearted 
to 



step 
out 
into 
the 
clear 
light 
of 
reason? 
What 
inquirer 
does 
not 
know 
that 
the 
hardest 
battle, 
in 
the 
transformation 
of 
his 
ideas, 
is 
fought 
with 
himself. 


Similar 
phenomena 
meet 
the 
natural 
inquirer 
in 
all 
paths 
and 
in 
the 
most 
trifling 
matters. 
The 
true 
inquirer 
seeks 
the 
truth 
everywhere, 
in 
his 
country-
walks 
and 
on 
the 
streets 
of 
the 
great 
city. 
If 
he 
is 
not 
too 
learned, 
he 
will 
observe 
that 
certain 
things, 
like 
ladies' 
hats, 
are 
constantly 
subject 
to 
change. 
I 
have 
not 
pursued 
special 
studies 
on 
this 
subject, 
but 
as 
long 
as 
I 
can 
remember, 
one 
form 
has 
always 
gradually 
changed 
into 
another. 
First, 
they 
wore 
hats 
with 
long 
projecting 
rims, 
within 
which, 
scarcely 
accessible 
with 
a 
telescope, 
lay 
concealed 
the 
face 
of 
the 
beautiful 
wearer. 
The 
rim 
grew 
smaller 
and 
smaller; 
the 
bonnet 
shrank 
to 
the 
irony 
of 
a 
hat. 
Now 
a 
tremendous 
superstructure 
is 
beginning 
to 
grow 
up 
in 
its 
place, 
and 
the 
gods 
only 
know 
what 
its 
limits 
will 
be. 
It 
is 
not 
otherwise 
with 
ladies' 
hats 
than 
with 
butterflies, 
whose 
multiplicity 
of 
form 
often 
simply 
comes 
from 
a 
slight 
excrescence 
on 
the 
wing 
of 
one 
species 
developing 
in 
a 
cognate 
species 
to 
a 
tremendous 
fold. 
Nature, 
too, 
has 
its 
fashions, 
but 
they 
last 
thousands 
of 
years. 
I 
could 
elucidate 
this 
idea 
by 
many 
additional 
examples; 
for 
instance, 
by 
the 
history 
of 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
coat, 
if 
I 
were 
not 
fearful 
that 
my 
gossip 
might 
prove 
irksome 
to 
you. 


We 
have 
now 
wandered 
through 
an 
odd 
corner 
of 
the 
history 
of 
science. 
What 
have 
we 
learned? 
The 
solution 
of 
a 
small, 
I 
might 
almost 
say 
insignificant, 
problem—the 
measurement 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
light. 
And 
more 
than 
two 
centuries 
have 
worked 
at 
its 
solution! 
Three 
of 
the 
most 
eminent 
natural 
philosophers, 
Galileo, 
an 
Italian, 
Römer, 
a 
Dane, 
and 
Fizeau, 
a 
Frenchman, 
have 
fairly 
shared 
its 
labors. 
And 
so 
it 
is 
with 
countless 
other 
questions. 
When 
we 
contemplate 
thus 
the 
many 
blossoms 
of 
thought 
that 
must 
wither 
and 
fall 
before 
one 
shall 
bloom, 
then 
shall 
we 
first 
truly 
appreciate 
Christ's 
weighty 
but 
little 
consolatory 
words: 
"Many 
be 
called 
but 
few 
are 
chosen." 


Such 
is 
the 
testimony 
of 
every 
page 
of 
history. 
But 
is 
history 
right? 
Are 
really 
only 
those 
chosen 
whom 
she 
names? 
Have 
those 
lived 
and 
battled 
in 
vain, 
who 
have 
won 
no 
prize? 


I 
doubt 
it. 
And 
so 
will 
every 
one 
who 
has 
felt 
the 
pangs 
of 
sleepless 
nights 



spent 
in 
thought, 
at 
first 
fruitless, 
but 
in 
the 
end 
successful. 
No 
thought 
in 
such 
struggles 
was 
thought 
in 
vain; 
each 
one, 
even 
the 
most 
insignificant, 
nay, 
even 
the 
erroneous 
thought, 
that 
which 
apparently 
was 
the 
least 
productive, 
served 
to 
prepare 
the 
way 
for 
those 
that 
afterwards 
bore 
fruit. 
And 
as 
in 
the 
thought 
of 
the 
individual 
naught 
is 
in 
vain, 
so, 
also, 
it 
is 
in 
that 
of 
humanity. 


Galileo 
wished 
to 
measure 
the 
velocity 
of 
light. 
He 
had 
to 
close 
his 
eyes 
before 
his 
wish 
was 
realised. 
But 
he 
at 
least 
found 
the 
lantern 
by 
which 
his 
successor 
could 
accomplish 
the 
task. 


And 
so 
I 
may 
maintain 
that 
we 
all, 
so 
far 
as 
inclination 
goes, 
are 
working 
at 
the 
civilisation 
of 
the 
future. 
If 
only 
we 
all 
strive 
for 
the 
right, 
then 
are 
we 
all 
called 
and 
all 
chosen! 



WHY 
HAS 
MAN 
TWO 
EYES? 


Why 
has 
man 
two 
eyes? 
That 
the 
pretty 
symmetry 
of 
his 
face 
may 
not 
be 
disturbed, 
the 
artist 
answers. 
That 
his 
second 
eye 
may 
furnish 
a 
substitute 
for 
his 
first 
if 
that 
be 
lost, 
says 
the 
far-sighted 
economist. 
That 
we 
may 
weep 
with 
two 
eyes 
at 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
world, 
replies 
the 
religious 
enthusiast. 


Odd 
opinions! 
Yet 
if 
you 
should 
approach 
a 
modern 
scientist 
with 
this 
question 
you 
might 
consider 
yourself 
fortunate 
if 
you 
escaped 
with 
less 
than 
a 
rebuff. 
"Pardon 
me, 
madam, 
or 
my 
dear 
sir," 
he 
would 
say, 
with 
stern 
expression, 
"man 
fulfils 
no 
purpose 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
his 
eyes; 
nature 
is 
not 
a 
person, 
and 
consequently 
not 
so 
vulgar 
as 
to 
pursue 
purposes 
of 
any 
kind." 


Still 
an 
unsatisfactory 
answer! 
I 
once 
knew 
a 
professor 
who 
would 
shut 
with 
horror 
the 
mouths 
of 
his 
pupils 
if 
they 
put 
to 
him 
such 
an 
unscientific 
question. 


But 
ask 
a 
more 
tolerant 
person, 
ask 
me. 
I, 
I 
candidly 
confess, 
do 
not 
know 
exactly 
why 
man 
has 
two 
eyes, 
but 
the 
reason 
partly 
is, 
I 
think, 
that 
I 
may 
see 
you 
here 
before 
me 
to-night 
and 
talk 
with 
you 
upon 
this 
delightful 
subject. 


Again 
you 
smile 
incredulously. 
Now 
this 
is 
one 
of 
those 
questions 
that 
a 
hundred 
wise 
men 
together 
could 
not 
answer. 
You 
have 
heard, 
so 
far, 
only 
five 
of 
these 
wise 
men. 
You 
will 
certainly 
want 
to 
be 
spared 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
other 
ninety-five. 
To 
the 
first 
you 
will 
reply 
that 
we 
should 
look 
just 
as 
pretty 
if 
we 
were 
born 
with 
only 
one 
eye, 
like 
the 
Cyclops; 
to 
the 
second 
we 
should 
be 
much 
better 
off, 
according 
to 
his 
principle, 
if 
we 
had 
four 
or 
eight 
eyes, 
and 
that 
in 
this 
respect 
we 
are 
vastly 
inferior 
to 
spiders; 
to 
the 
third, 
that 
you 
are 
not 
just 
in 
the 
mood 
to 
weep; 
to 
the 
fourth, 
that 
the 
unqualified 
interdiction 
of 
the 
question 
excites 
rather 
than 
satisfies 
your 
curiosity; 
while 
of 
me 
you 
will 
dispose 
by 
saying 
that 
my 
pleasure 
is 
not 
as 
intense 
as 
I 
think, 
and 
certainly 
not 
great 
enough 
to 
justify 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
double 
eye 
in 
man 
since 
the 
fall 
of 
Adam. 



But 
since 
you 
are 
not 
satisfied 
with 
my 
brief 
and 
obvious 
answer, 
you 
have 
only 
yourselves 
to 
blame 
for 
the 
consequences. 
You 
must 
now 
listen 
to 
a 
longer 
and 
more 
learned 
explanation, 
such 
as 
it 
is 
in 
my 
power 
to 
give. 


As 
the 
church 
of 
science, 
however, 
debars 
the 
question 
"Why?" 
let 
us 
put 
the 
matter 
in 
a 
purely 
orthodox 
way: 
Man 
has 
two 
eyes, 
what 
more 
can 
he 
see 
with 
two 
than 
with 
one? 


I 
will 
invite 
you 
to 
take 
a 
walk 
with 
me? 
We 
see 
before 
us 
a 
wood. 
What 
is 
it 
that 
makes 
this 
real 
wood 
contrast 
so 
favorably 
with 
a 
painted 
wood, 
no 
matter 
how 
perfect 
the 
painting 
may 
be? 
What 
makes 
the 
one 
so 
much 
more 
lovely 
than 
the 
other? 
Is 
it 
the 
vividness 
of 
the 
coloring, 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
lights 
and 
the 
shadows? 
I 
think 
not. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
in 
this 
respect 
painting 
can 
accomplish 
very 
much. 


The 
cunning 
hand 
of 
the 
painter 
can 
conjure 
up 
with 
a 
few 
strokes 
of 
his 
brush 
forms 
of 
wonderful 
plasticity. 
By 
the 
help 
of 
other 
means 
even 
more 
can 
be 
attained. 
Photographs 
of 
reliefs 
are 
so 
plastic 
that 
we 
often 
imagine 
we 
can 
actually 
lay 
hold 
of 
the 
elevations 
and 
depressions. 


But 
one 
thing 
the 
painter 
never 
can 
give 
with 
the 
vividness 
that 
nature 
does— 
the 
difference 
of 
near 
and 
far. 
In 
the 
real 
woods 
you 
see 
plainly 
that 
you 
can 
lay 
hold 
of 
some 
trees, 
but 
that 
others 
are 
inaccessibly 
far. 
The 
picture 
of 
the 
painter 
is 
rigid. 
The 
picture 
of 
the 
real 
woods 
changes 
on 
the 
slightest 
movement. 
Now 
this 
branch 
is 
hidden 
behind 
that; 
now 
that 
behind 
this. 
The 
trees 
are 
alternately 
visible 
and 
invisible. 


Let 
us 
look 
at 
this 
matter 
a 
little 
more 
closely. 
For 
convenience 
sake 
we 
shall 
remain 
upon 
the 
highway, 
I, 
II. 
(Fig. 
20.) 
To 
the 
right 
and 
the 
left 
lies 
the 
forest. 
Standing 
at 
I, 
we 
see, 
let 
us 
say, 
three 
trees 
(1, 
2, 
3) 
in 
a 
line, 
so 
that 
the 
two 
remote 
ones 
are 
covered 
by 
the 
nearest. 
Moving 
further 
along, 
this 
changes. 
At 
II 
we 
shall 
not 
have 
to 
look 
round 
so 
far 
to 
see 
the 
remotest 
tree 
3 
as 
to 
see 
the 
nearer 
tree 
2, 
nor 
so 
far 
to 
see 
this 
as 
to 
see 
1. 
Hence, 
as 
we 
move 
onward, 
objects 
that 
are 
near 
to 
us 
seem 
to 
lag 
behind 
as 
compared 
with 
objects 
that 
are 
remote 
from 
us, 
the 
lagging 
increasing 
with 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
objects. 
Very 
remote 
objects, 
towards 
which 
we 
must 
always 
look 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
as 
we 
proceed, 
appear 
to 
travel 
along 
with 
us. 



If 
we 
should 
see, 
therefore, 
jutting 
above 
the 
brow 
of 
yonder 
hill 
the 
tops 
of 
two 
trees 
whose 
distance 
from 
us 
we 
were 
in 
doubt 
about, 
we 
should 
have 
in 
our 
hands 
a 
very 
easy 
means 
of 
deciding 
the 
question. 
We 
should 
take 
a 
few 
steps 
forward, 
say 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
the 
tree-top 
which 
receded 
most 
to 
the 
left 
would 
be 
the 
one 
nearer 
to 
us. 
In 
truth, 
from 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
recession 
a 
geometer 
could 
actually 
determine 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
trees 
from 
us 
without 
ever 
going 
near 
them. 
It 
is 
simply 
the 
scientific 
development 
of 
this 
perception 
that 
enables 
us 
to 
measure 
the 
distances 
of 
the 
stars. 


Hence, 
from 
change 
of 
view 
in 
forward 
motion 
the 
distances 
of 
objects 
in 
our 
field 
of 
vision 
can 
be 
measured. 


Rigorously, 
however, 
even 
forward 
motion 
is 
not 
necessary. 
For 
every 
observer 
is 
composed 
really 
of 
two 
observers. 
Man 
has 
two 
eyes. 
The 
right 
eye 
is 
a 
short 
step 
ahead 
of 
the 
left 
eye 
in 
the 
right-hand 
direction. 
Hence, 
the 
two 
eyes 
receive 
different 
pictures 
of 
the 
same 
woods. 
The 
right 
eye 
will 
see 
the 
near 
trees 
displaced 
to 
the 
left, 
and 
the 
left 
eye 
will 
see 
them 
displaced 
to 
the 
right, 
the 
displacement 
being 
greater, 
the 
greater 
the 
proximity. 
This 
difference 
is 
sufficient 
for 
forming 
ideas 
of 
distance. 


We 
may 
now 
readily 
convince 
ourselves 
of 
the 
following 
facts: 


1. 
With 
one 
eye, 
the 
other 
being 
shut, 
you 
have 
a 
very 
uncertain 
judgment 
of 
distances. 
You 
will 
find 
it, 
for 
example, 
no 
easy 
task, 
with 
one 
eye 
shut, 
to 
thrust 
a 
stick 
through 
a 
ring 
hung 
up 
before 
you; 
you 
will 
miss 
the 
ring 
in 
almost 
every 
instance. 
2. 
You 
see 
the 
same 
object 
differently 
with 
the 
right 
eye 
from 
what 
you 
do 
with 
the 
left. 
Place 
a 
lamp-shade 
on 
the 
table 
in 
front 
of 
you 
with 
its 
broad 
opening 
turned 
downwards, 
and 
look 
at 
it 
from 
above. 
(Fig. 
21.) 
You 
will 
see 
with 
your 
right 
eye 
the 
image 
2, 
with 
your 
left 
eye 
the 
image 
1. 
Again, 
place 
the 
shade 
with 
its 
wide 
opening 
turned 
upwards; 
you 
will 
receive 
with 
your 
right 
eye 
the 
image 
4, 
with 
your 
left 
eye 
the 
image 
3. 
Euclid 
mentions 
phenomena 
of 
this 
character. 


3. 
Finally, 
you 
know 
that 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
judge 
of 
distances 
with 
both 
eyes. 

Accordingly 
your 
judgment 
must 
spring 
in 
some 
way 
from 
a 
co-operation 
of 
the 
two 
eyes. 
In 
the 
preceding 
example 
the 
openings 
in 
the 
different 
images 
received 
by 
the 
two 
eyes 
seem 
displaced 
with 
respect 
to 
one 
another, 
and 
this 
displacement 
is 
sufficient 
for 
the 
inference 
that 
the 
one 
opening 
is 
nearer 
than 
the 
other. 


I 
have 
no 
doubt 
that 
you, 
ladies, 
have 
frequently 
received 
delicate 
compliments 
upon 
your 
eyes, 
but 
I 
feel 
sure 
that 
no 
one 
has 
ever 
told 
you, 
and 
I 
know 
not 
whether 
it 
will 
flatter 
you, 
that 
you 
have 
in 
your 
eyes, 
be 
they 
blue 
or 
black, 
little 
geometricians. 
You 
say 
you 
know 
nothing 
of 
them? 
Well, 
for 
that 
matter, 
neither 
do 
I. 
But 
the 
facts 
are 
as 
I 
tell 
you. 


You 
understand 
little 
of 
geometry? 
I 
shall 
accept 
that 
confession. 
Yet 
with 
the 
help 
of 
your 
two 
eyes 
you 
judge 
of 
distances? 
Surely 
that 
is 
a 
geometrical 
problem. 
And 
what 
is 
more, 
you 
know 
the 
solution 
of 
this 
problem: 
for 
you 
estimate 
distances 
correctly. 
If, 
then, 
you 
do 
not 
solve 
the 
problem, 
the 
little 
geometricians 
in 
your 
eyes 
must 
do 
it 
clandestinely 
and 
whisper 
the 
solution 
to 
you. 
I 
doubt 
not 
they 
are 
fleet 
little 
fellows. 


What 
amazes 
me 
most 
here 
is, 
that 
you 
know 
nothing 
about 
these 
little 
geometricians. 
But 
perhaps 
they 
also 
know 
nothing 
about 
you. 
Perhaps 
they 
are 
models 
of 
punctuality, 
routine 
clerks 
who 
bother 
about 
nothing 
but 
their 
fixed 
work. 
In 
that 
case 
we 
may 
be 
able 
to 
deceive 
the 
gentlemen. 


If 
we 
present 
to 
our 
right 
eye 
an 
image 
which 
looks 
exactly 
like 
the 
lampshade 
for 
the 
right 
eye, 
and 
to 
our 
left 
eye 
an 
image 
which 
looks 
exactly 
like 
a 
lamp-shade 
for 
the 
left 
eye, 
we 
shall 
imagine 
that 
we 
see 
the 
whole 
lampshade 
bodily 
before 
us. 


You 
know 
the 
experiment. 
If 
you 
are 
practised 
in 
squinting, 
you 
can 
perform 
it 
directly 
with 
the 
figure, 
looking 
with 
your 
right 
eye 
at 
the 
right 
image, 
and 
with 
your 
left 
eye 
at 
the 
left 
image. 
In 
this 
way 
the 
experiment 
was 
first 
performed 
by 
Elliott. 
Improved 
and 
perfected, 
its 
form 
is 
Wheatstone's 
stereoscope, 
made 
so 
popular 
and 
useful 
by 
Brewster. 


By 
taking 
two 
photographs 
of 
the 
same 
object 
from 
two 
different 
points, 
corresponding 
to 
the 
two 
eyes, 
a 
very 
clear 
three-dimensional 
picture 
of 
distant 
places 
or 
buildings 
can 
be 
produced 
by 
the 
stereoscope. 



But 
the 
stereoscope 
accomplishes 
still 
more 
than 
this. 
It 
can 
visualise 
things 
for 
us 
which 
we 
never 
see 
with 
equal 
clearness 
in 
real 
objects. 
You 
know 
that 
if 
you 
move 
much 
while 
your 
photograph 
is 
being 
taken, 
your 
picture 
will 
come 
out 
like 
that 
of 
a 
Hindu 
deity, 
with 
several 
heads 
or 
several 
arms, 
which, 
at 
the 
spaces 
where 
they 
overlap, 
show 
forth 
with 
equal 
distinctness, 
so 
that 
we 
seem 
to 
see 
the 
one 
picture 
through 
the 
other. 
If 
a 
person 
moves 
quickly 
away 
from 
the 
camera 
before 
the 
impression 
is 
completed, 
the 
objects 
behind 
him 
will 
also 
be 
imprinted 
upon 
the 
photograph; 
the 
person 
will 
look 
transparent. 
Photographic 
ghosts 
are 
made 
in 
this 
way. 


Some 
very 
useful 
applications 
may 
be 
made 
of 
this 
discovery. 
For 
example, 
if 
we 
photograph 
a 
machine 
stereoscopically, 
successively 
removing 
during 
the 
operation 
the 
single 
parts 
(where 
of 
course 
the 
impression 
suffers 
interruptions), 
we 
obtain 
a 
transparent 
view, 
endowed 
with 
all 
the 
marks 
of 
spatial 
solidity, 
in 
which 
is 
distinctly 
visualised 
the 
interaction 
of 
parts 
normally 
concealed. 
I 
have 
employed 
this 
method 
for 
obtaining 
transparent 
stereoscopic 
views 
of 
anatomical 
structures. 


You 
see, 
photography 
is 
making 
stupendous 
advances, 
and 
there 
is 
great 
danger 
that 
in 
time 
some 
malicious 
artist 
will 
photograph 
his 
innocent 
patrons 
with 
solid 
views 
of 
their 
most 
secret 
thoughts 
and 
emotions. 
How 
tranquil 
politics 
will 
then 
be! 
What 
rich 
harvests 
our 
detective 
force 
will 
reap! 


By 
the 
joint 
action 
of 
the 
two 
eyes, 
therefore, 
we 
arrive 
at 
our 
judgments 
of 
distances, 
as 
also 
of 
the 
forms 
of 
bodies. 


Permit 
me 
to 
mention 
here 
a 
few 
additional 
facts 
connected 
with 
this 
subject, 
which 
will 
assist 
us 
in 
the 
comprehension 
of 
certain 
phenomena 
in 
the 
history 
of 
civilisation. 


You 
have 
often 
heard, 
and 
know 
from 
personal 
experience, 
that 
remote 
objects 
appear 
perspectively 
dwarfed. 
In 
fact, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
satisfy 
yourself 
that 
you 
can 
cover 
the 
image 
of 
a 
man 
a 
few 
feet 
away 
from 
you 
simply 
by 
holding 
up 
your 
finger 
a 
short 
distance 
in 
front 
of 
your 
eye. 
Still, 
as 
a 
general 
rule, 
you 
do 
not 
notice 
this 
shrinkage 
of 
objects. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
you 
imagine 
you 
see 
a 
man 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a 
large 
hall, 
as 
large 
as 
you 
see 
him 
near 
by 
you. 
For 
your 
eye, 
in 
its 
measurement 
of 
the 
distances, 
makes 
remote 



objects 
correspondingly 
larger. 
The 
eye, 
so 
to 
speak, 
is 
aware 
of 
this 
perspective 
contraction 
and 
is 
not 
deceived 
by 
it, 
although 
its 
possessor 
is 
unconscious 
of 
the 
fact. 
All 
persons 
who 
have 
attempted 
to 
draw 
from 
nature 
have 
vividly 
felt 
the 
difficulty 
which 
this 
superior 
dexterity 
of 
the 
eye 
causes 
the 
perspective 
conception. 
Not 
until 
one's 
judgment 
of 
distances 
is 
made 
uncertain, 
by 
their 
size, 
or 
from 
lack 
of 
points 
of 
reference, 
or 
from 
being 
too 
quickly 
changed, 
is 
the 
perspective 
rendered 
very 
prominent. 


On 
sweeping 
round 
a 
curve 
on 
a 
rapidly 
moving 
railway 
train, 
where 
a 
wide 
prospect 
is 
suddenly 
opened 
up, 
the 
men 
upon 
distant 
hills 
appear 
like 
dolls. 


[17] 
You 
have 
at 
the 
moment, 
here, 
no 
known 
references 
for 
the 
measurement 
of 
distances. 
The 
stones 
at 
the 
entrance 
of 
a 
tunnel 
grow 
visibly 
larger 
as 
we 
ride 
towards 
it; 
they 
shrink 
visibly 
in 
size 
as 
we 
ride 
from 
it. 
Usually 
both 
eyes 
work 
together. 
As 
certain 
views 
are 
frequently 
repeated, 
and 
lead 
always 
to 
substantially 
the 
same 
judgments 
of 
distances, 
the 
eyes 
in 
time 
must 
acquire 
a 
special 
skill 
in 
geometrical 
constructions. 
In 
the 
end, 
undoubtedly, 
this 
skill 
is 
so 
increased 
that 
a 
single 
eye 
alone 
is 
often 
tempted 
to 
exercise 
that 
office. 


Permit 
me 
to 
elucidate 
this 
point 
by 
an 
example. 
Is 
any 
sight 
more 
familiar 
to 
you 
than 
that 
of 
a 
vista 
down 
a 
long 
street? 
Who 
has 
not 
looked 
with 
hopeful 
eyes 
time 
and 
again 
into 
a 
street 
and 
measured 
its 
depth. 
I 
will 
take 
you 
now 
into 
an 
art-gallery 
where 
I 
will 
suppose 
you 
to 
see 
a 
picture 
representing 
a 
vista 
into 
a 
street. 
The 
artist 
has 
not 
spared 
his 
rulers 
to 
get 
his 
perspective 
perfect. 
The 
geometrician 
in 
your 
left 
eye 
thinks, 
"Ah 
ha! 
I 
have 
computed 
that 
case 
a 
hundred 
times 
or 
more. 
I 
know 
it 
by 
heart. 
It 
is 
a 
vista 
into 
a 
street," 
he 
continues; 
"where 
the 
houses 
are 
lower 
is 
the 
remote 
end." 
The 
geometrician 
in 
the 
right 
eye, 
too 
much 
at 
his 
ease 
to 
question 
his 
possibly 
peevish 
comrade 
in 
the 
matter, 
answers 
the 
same. 
But 
the 
sense 
of 
duty 
of 
these 
punctual 
little 
fellows 
is 
at 
once 
rearoused. 
They 
set 
to 
work 
at 
their 
calculations 
and 
immediately 
find 
that 
all 
the 
points 
of 
the 
picture 
are 
equally 
distant 
from 
them, 
that 
is, 
lie 
all 
upon 
a 
plane 
surface. 


What 
opinion 
will 
you 
now 
accept, 
the 
first 
or 
the 
second? 
If 
you 
accept 
the 
first 
you 
will 
see 
distinctly 
the 
vista. 
If 
you 
accept 
the 
second 
you 
will 
see 
nothing 
but 
a 
painted 
sheet 
of 
distorted 
images. 



It 
seems 
to 
you 
a 
trifling 
matter 
to 
look 
at 
a 
picture 
and 
understand 
its 
perspective. 
Yet 
centuries 
elapsed 
before 
humanity 
came 
fully 
to 
appreciate 
this 
trifle, 
and 
even 
the 
majority 
of 
you 
first 
learned 
it 
from 
education. 


I 
can 
remember 
very 
distinctly 
that 
at 
three 
years 
of 
age 
all 
perspective 
drawings 
appeared 
to 
me 
as 
gross 
caricatures 
of 
objects. 
I 
could 
not 
understand 
why 
artists 
made 
tables 
so 
broad 
at 
one 
end 
and 
so 
narrow 
at 
the 
other. 
Real 
tables 
seemed 
to 
me 
just 
as 
broad 
at 
one 
end 
as 
at 
the 
other, 
because 
my 
eye 
made 
and 
interpreted 
its 
calculations 
without 
my 
intervention. 
But 
that 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
table 
on 
the 
plane 
surface 
was 
not 
to 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
plane 
painted 
surface 
but 
stood 
for 
a 
table 
and 
so 
was 
to 
be 
imaged 
with 
all 
the 
attributes 
of 
extension 
was 
a 
joke 
that 
I 
did 
not 
understand. 
But 
I 
have 
the 
consolation 
that 
whole 
nations 
have 
not 
understood 
it. 


Ingenuous 
people 
there 
are 
who 
take 
the 
mock 
murders 
of 
the 
stage 
for 
real 
murders, 
the 
dissembled 
actions 
of 
the 
players 
for 
real 
actions, 
and 
who 
can 
scarcely 
restrain 
themselves, 
when 
the 
characters 
of 
the 
play 
are 
sorely 
pressed, 
from 
running 
in 
deep 
indignation 
to 
their 
assistance. 
Others, 
again, 
can 
never 
forget 
that 
the 
beautiful 
landscapes 
of 
the 
stage 
are 
painted, 
that 
Richard 
III. 
is 
only 
the 
actor, 
Mr. 
Booth, 
whom 
they 
have 
met 
time 
and 
again 
at 
the 
clubs. 


Both 
points 
of 
view 
are 
equally 
mistaken. 
To 
look 
at 
a 
drama 
or 
a 
picture 
properly 
one 
must 
understand 
that 
both 
are 
shows, 
simply 
denoting 
something 
real. 
A 
certain 
preponderance 
of 
the 
intellectual 
life 
over 
the 
sensuous 
life 
is 
requisite 
for 
such 
an 
achievement, 
where 
the 
intellectual 
elements 
are 
safe 
from 
destruction 
by 
the 
direct 
sensuous 
impressions. 
A 
certain 
liberty 
in 
choosing 
one's 
point 
of 
view 
is 
necessary, 
a 
sort 
of 
humor, 
I 
might 
say, 
which 
is 
strongly 
wanting 
in 
children 
and 
in 
childlike 
peoples. 


Let 
us 
look 
at 
a 
few 
historical 
facts. 
I 
shall 
not 
take 
you 
as 
far 
back 
as 
the 
stone 
age, 
although 
we 
possess 
sketches 
from 
this 
epoch 
which 
show 
very 
original 
ideas 
of 
perspective. 
But 
let 
us 
begin 
our 
sight-seeing 
in 
the 
tombs 
and 
ruined 
temples 
of 
ancient 
Egypt, 
where 
the 
numberless 
reliefs 
and 
gorgeous 
colorings 
have 
defied 
the 
ravages 
of 
thousands 
of 
years. 


A 
rich 
and 
motley 
life 
is 
here 
opened 
to 
us. 
We 
find 
the 
Egyptians 



represented 
in 
all 
conditions 
of 
life. 
What 
at 
once 
strikes 
our 
attention 
in 
these 
pictures 
is 
the 
delicacy 
of 
their 
technical 
execution. 
The 
contours 
are 
extremely 
exact 
and 
distinct. 
But 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
only 
a 
few 
bright 
colors 
are 
found, 
unblended 
and 
without 
trace 
of 
transition. 
Shadows 
are 
totally 
wanting. 
The 
paint 
is 
laid 
on 
the 
surfaces 
in 
equal 
thicknesses. 


Shocking 
for 
the 
modern 
eye 
is 
the 
perspective. 
All 
the 
figures 
are 
equally 
large, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
king, 
whose 
form 
is 
unduly 
exaggerated. 
Near 
and 
far 
appear 
equally 
large. 
Perspective 
contraction 
is 
nowhere 
employed. 
A 
pond 
with 
water-fowl 
is 
represented 
flat, 
as 
if 
its 
surface 
were 
vertical. 


Human 
figures 
are 
portrayed 
as 
they 
are 
never 
seen, 
the 
legs 
from 
the 
side, 
the 
face 
in 
profile. 
The 
breast 
lies 
in 
its 
full 
breadth 
across 
the 
plane 
of 
representation. 
The 
heads 
of 
cattle 
appear 
in 
profile, 
while 
the 
horns 
lie 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
drawing. 
The 
principle 
which 
the 
Egyptians 
followed 
might 
be 
best 
expressed 
by 
saying 
that 
their 
figures 
are 
pressed 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
drawing 
as 
plants 
are 
pressed 
in 
a 
herbarium. 


The 
matter 
is 
simply 
explained. 
If 
the 
Egyptians 
were 
accustomed 
to 
looking 
at 
things 
ingenuously 
with 
both 
eyes 
at 
once, 
the 
construction 
of 
perspective 
pictures 
in 
space 
could 
not 
be 
familiar 
to 
them. 
They 
saw 
all 
arms, 
all 
legs 
on 
real 
men 
in 
their 
natural 
lengths. 
The 
figures 
pressed 
into 
the 
planes 
resembled 
more 
closely, 
of 
course, 
in 
their 
eyes 
the 
originals 
than 
perspective 
pictures 
could. 


This 
will 
be 
better 
understood 
if 
we 
reflect 
that 
painting 
was 
developed 
from 
relief. 
The 
minor 
dissimilarities 
between 
the 
pressed 
figures 
and 
the 
originals 
must 
gradually 
have 
compelled 
men 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
perspective 
drawing. 
But 
physiologically 
the 
painting 
of 
the 
Egyptians 
is 
just 
as 
much 
justified 
as 
the 
drawings 
of 
our 
children 
are. 


A 
slight 
advance 
beyond 
the 
Egyptians 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
Assyrians. 
The 
reliefs 
rescued 
from 
the 
ruined 
mounds 
of 
Nimrod 
at 
Mossul 
are, 
upon 
the 
whole, 
similar 
to 
the 
Egyptian 
reliefs. 
They 
were 
made 
known 
to 
us 
principally 
by 
Layard. 


Painting 
enters 
on 
a 
new 
phase 
among 
the 
Chinese. 
This 
people 
have 
a 
marked 
feeling 
for 
perspective 
and 
correct 
shading, 
yet 
without 
being 
very 



logical 
in 
the 
application 
of 
their 
principles. 
Here, 
too, 
it 
seems, 
they 
took 
the 
first 
step 
but 
did 
not 
go 
far. 
In 
harmony 
with 
this 
immobility 
is 
their 
constitution, 
in 
which 
the 
muzzle 
and 
the 
bamboo-rod 
play 
significant 
functions. 
In 
accord 
with 
it, 
too, 
is 
their 
language, 
which 
like 
the 
language 
of 
children 
has 
not 
yet 
developed 
into 
a 
grammar, 
or, 
rather, 
according 
to 
the 
modern 
conception, 
has 
not 
yet 
degenerated 
into 
a 
grammar. 
It 
is 
the 
same 
also 
with 
their 
music 
which 
is 
satisfied 
with 
the 
five-toned 
scale. 


The 
mural 
paintings 
at 
Herculaneum 
and 
Pompeii 
are 
distinguished 
by 
grace 
of 
representation, 
as 
also 
by 
a 
pronounced 
sense 
for 
perspective 
and 
correct 
illumination, 
yet 
they 
are 
not 
at 
all 
scrupulous 
in 
construction. 
Here 
still 
we 
find 
abbreviations 
avoided. 
But 
to 
offset 
this 
defect, 
the 
members 
of 
the 
body 
are 
brought 
into 
unnatural 
positions, 
in 
which 
they 
appear 
in 
their 
full 
lengths. 
Abridgements 
are 
more 
frequently 
observed 
in 
clothed 
than 
in 
unclothed 
figures. 


A 
satisfactory 
explanation 
of 
these 
phenomena 
first 
occurred 
to 
me 
on 
the 
making 
of 
a 
few 
simple 
experiments 
which 
show 
how 
differently 
one 
may 
see 
the 
same 
object, 
after 
some 
mastery 
of 
one's 
senses 
has 
been 
attained, 
simply 
by 
the 
arbitrary 
movement 
of 
the 
attention. 


Look 
at 
the 
annexed 
drawing 
(Fig. 
22). 
It 
represents 
a 
folded 
sheet 
of 
paper 
with 
either 
its 
depressed 
or 
its 
elevated 
side 
turned 
towards 
you, 
as 
you 
wish. 
You 
can 
conceive 
the 
drawing 
in 
either 
sense, 
and 
in 
either 
case 
it 
will 
appear 
to 
you 
differently. 


If, 
now, 
you 
have 
a 
real 
folded 
sheet 
of 
paper 
on 
the 
table 
before 
you, 
with 
its 
sharp 
edges 
turned 
towards 
you, 
you 
can, 
on 
looking 
at 
it 
with 
one 
eye, 
see 
the 
sheet 
alternately 
elevated, 
as 
it 
really 
is, 
or 
depressed. 
Here, 
however, 
a 
remarkable 
phenomenon 
is 
presented. 
When 
you 
see 
the 
sheet 
properly, 
neither 
illumination 
nor 
form 
presents 
anything 
conspicuous. 
When 
you 
see 
it 
bent 
back 
you 
see 
it 
perspectively 
distorted. 
Light 
and 
shadow 
appear 
much 
brighter 
or 
darker, 
or 
as 
if 
overlaid 
thickly 
with 
bright 
colors. 
Light 
and 
shadow 
now 
appear 
devoid 
of 
all 
cause. 
They 
no 
longer 
harmonise 
with 
the 
body's 
form, 
and 
are 
thus 
rendered 
much 
more 
prominent. 


In 
common 
life 
we 
employ 
the 
perspective 
and 
illumination 
of 
objects 
to 
determine 
their 
forms 
and 
position. 
Hence 
we 
do 
not 
notice 
the 
lights, 
the 



shadows, 
and 
the 
distortions. 
They 
first 
powerfully 
enter 
consciousness 
when 
we 
employ 
a 
different 
construction 
from 
the 
usual 
spatial 
one. 
In 
looking 
at 
the 
planar 
image 
of 
a 
camera 
obscura 
we 
are 
amazed 
at 
the 
plenitude 
of 
the 
light 
and 
the 
profundity 
of 
the 
shadows, 
both 
of 
which 
we 
do 
not 
notice 
in 
real 
objects. 


In 
my 
earliest 
youth 
the 
shadows 
and 
lights 
on 
pictures 
appeared 
to 
me 
as 
spots 
void 
of 
meaning. 
When 
I 
began 
to 
draw 
I 
regarded 
shading 
as 
a 
mere 
custom 
of 
artists. 
I 
once 
drew 
the 
portrait 
of 
our 
pastor, 
a 
friend 
of 
the 
family, 
and 
shaded, 
from 
no 
necessity, 
but 
simply 
from 
having 
seen 
something 
similar 
in 
other 
pictures, 
the 
whole 
half 
of 
his 
face 
black. 
I 
was 
subjected 
for 
this 
to 
a 
severe 
criticism 
on 
the 
part 
of 
my 
mother, 
and 
my 
deeply 
offended 
artist's 
pride 
is 
probably 
the 
reason 
that 
these 
facts 
remained 
so 
strongly 
impressed 
upon 
my 
memory. 


You 
see, 
then, 
that 
many 
strange 
things, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
life 
of 
individuals, 
but 
also 
in 
that 
of 
humanity, 
and 
in 
the 
history 
of 
general 
civilisation, 
may 
be 
explained 
from 
the 
simple 
fact 
that 
man 
has 
two 
eyes. 


Change 
man's 
eye 
and 
you 
change 
his 
conception 
of 
the 
world. 
We 
have 
observed 
the 
truth 
of 
this 
fact 
among 
our 
nearest 
kin, 
the 
Egyptians, 
the 
Chinese, 
and 
the 
lake-dwellers; 
how 
must 
it 
be 
among 
some 
of 
our 
remoter 
relatives,—with 
monkeys 
and 
other 
animals? 
Nature 
must 
appear 
totally 
different 
to 
animals 
equipped 
with 
substantially 
different 
eyes 
from 
those 
of 
men, 
as, 
for 
example, 
to 
insects. 
But 
for 
the 
present 
science 
must 
forego 
the 
pleasure 
of 
portraying 
this 
appearance, 
as 
we 
know 
very 
little 
as 
yet 
of 
the 
mode 
of 
operation 
of 
these 
organs. 


It 
is 
an 
enigma 
even 
how 
nature 
appears 
to 
animals 
closely 
related 
to 
man; 
as 
to 
birds, 
who 
see 
scarcely 
anything 
with 
two 
eyes 
at 
once, 
but 
since 
their 
eyes 
are 
placed 
on 
opposite 
sides 
of 
their 
heads, 
have 
a 
separate 
field 
of 
vision 
for 
each. 
[18] 


The 
soul 
of 
man 
is 
pent 
up 
in 
the 
prison-house 
of 
his 
head; 
it 
looks 
at 
nature 
through 
its 
two 
windows, 
the 
eyes. 
It 
would 
also 
fain 
know 
how 
nature 
looks 
through 
other 
windows. 
A 
desire 
apparently 
never 
to 
be 
fulfilled. 
But 
our 
love 
for 
nature 
is 
inventive, 
and 
here, 
too, 
much 
has 
been 
accomplished. 



Placing 
before 
me 
an 
angular 
mirror, 
consisting 
of 
two 
plane 
mirrors 
slightly 
inclined 
to 
each 
other, 
I 
see 
my 
face 
twice 
reflected. 
In 
the 
right-hand 
mirror 
I 
obtain 
a 
view 
of 
the 
right 
side, 
and 
in 
the 
left-hand 
mirror 
a 
view 
of 
the 
left 
side, 
of 
my 
face. 
Also 
I 
shall 
see 
the 
face 
of 
a 
person 
standing 
in 
front 
of 
me, 
more 
to 
the 
right 
with 
my 
right 
eye, 
more 
to 
the 
left 
with 
my 
left. 
But 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
such 
widely 
different 
views 
of 
a 
face 
as 
those 
shown 
in 
the 
angular 
mirror, 
my 
two 
eyes 
would 
have 
to 
be 
set 
much 
further 
apart 
from 
each 
other 
than 
they 
actually 
are. 


Squinting 
with 
my 
right 
eye 
at 
the 
image 
in 
the 
right-hand 
mirror, 
with 
my 
left 
eye 
at 
the 
image 
in 
the 
left-hand 
mirror, 
my 
vision 
will 
be 
the 
vision 
of 
a 
giant 
having 
an 
enormous 
head 
with 
his 
two 
eyes 
set 
far 
apart. 
This, 
also, 
is 
the 
impression 
which 
my 
own 
face 
makes 
upon 
me. 
I 
see 
it 
now, 
single 
and 
solid. 
Fixing 
my 
gaze, 
the 
relief 
from 
second 
to 
second 
is 
magnified, 
the 
eyebrows 
start 
forth 
prominently 
from 
above 
the 
eyes, 
the 
nose 
seems 
to 
grow 
a 
foot 
in 
length, 
my 
mustache 
shoots 
forth 
like 
a 
fountain 
from 
my 
lip, 
the 
teeth 
seem 
to 
retreat 
immeasurably. 
But 
by 
far 
the 
most 
horrible 
aspect 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
is 
the 
nose. 


Interesting 
in 
this 
connexion 
is 
the 
telestereoscope 
of 
Helmholtz. 
In 
the 
telestereoscope 
we 
view 
a 
landscape 
by 
looking 
with 
our 
right 
eye 
(Fig. 
24) 
through 
the 
mirror 
a 
into 
the 
mirror 
A, 
and 
with 
our 
left 
eye 
through 
the 
mirror 
b 
into 
the 
mirror 
B. 
The 
mirrors 
A 
and 
B 
stand 
far 
apart. 
Again 
we 
see 
with 
the 
widely 
separated 
eyes 
of 
a 
giant. 
Everything 
appears 
dwarfed 
and 
near 
us. 
The 
distant 
mountains 
look 
like 
moss-covered 
stones 
at 
our 
feet. 
Between, 
you 
see 
the 
reduced 
model 
of 
a 
city, 
a 
veritable 
Liliput. 
You 
are 
tempted 
almost 
to 
stroke 
with 
your 
hand 
the 
soft 
forest 
and 
city, 
did 
you 
not 
fear 
that 
you 
might 
prick 
your 
fingers 
on 
the 
sharp, 
needle-shaped 
steeples, 
or 
that 
they 
might 
crackle 
and 
break 
off. 


Liliput 
is 
no 
fable. 
We 
need 
only 
Swift's 
eyes, 
the 
telestereoscope, 
to 
see 
it. 


Picture 
to 
yourself 
the 
reverse 
case. 
Let 
us 
suppose 
ourselves 
so 
small 
that 
we 
could 
take 
long 
walks 
in 
a 
forest 
of 
moss, 
and 
that 
our 
eyes 
were 
correspondingly 
near 
each 
other. 
The 
moss-fibres 
would 
appear 
like 
trees. 
On 
them 
we 
should 
see 
strange, 
unshapely 
monsters 
creeping 
about. 
Branches 
of 
the 
oak-tree, 
at 
whose 
base 
our 
moss-forest 
lay, 
would 
seem 
to 
us 
dark, 
immovable, 
myriad-branched 
clouds, 
painted 
high 
on 
the 
vault 
of 
heaven; 



just 
as 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
Saturn, 
forsooth, 
might 
see 
their 
enormous 
ring. 
On 
the 
tree-trunks 
of 
our 
mossy 
woodland 
we 
should 
find 
colossal 
globes 
several 
feet 
in 
diameter, 
brilliantly 
transparent, 
swayed 
by 
the 
winds 
with 
slow, 
peculiar 
motions. 
We 
should 
approach 
inquisitively 
and 
should 
find 
that 
these 
globes, 
in 
which 
here 
and 
there 
animals 
were 
gaily 
sporting, 
were 
liquid 
globes, 
in 
fact 
that 
they 
were 
water. 
A 
short, 
incautious 
step, 
the 
slightest 
contact, 
and 
woe 
betide 
us, 
our 
arm 
is 
irresistibly 
drawn 
by 
an 
invisible 
power 
into 
the 
interior 
of 
the 
sphere 
and 
held 
there 
unrelentingly 
fast! 
A 
drop 
of 
dew 
has 
engulfed 
in 
its 
capillary 
maw 
a 
manikin, 
in 
revenge 
for 
the 
thousands 
of 
drops 
that 
its 
big 
human 
counterparts 
have 
quaffed 
at 
breakfast. 
Thou 
shouldst 
have 
known, 
thou 
pygmy 
natural 
scientist, 
that 
with 
thy 
present 
puny 
bulk 
thou 
shouldst 
not 
joke 
with 
capillarity! 


My 
terror 
at 
the 
accident 
brings 
me 
back 
to 
my 
senses. 
I 
see 
I 
have 
turned 
idyllic. 
You 
must 
pardon 
me. 
A 
patch 
of 
greensward, 
a 
moss 
or 
heather 
forest 
with 
its 
tiny 
inhabitants 
have 
incomparably 
more 
charms 
for 
me 
than 
many 
a 
bit 
of 
literature 
with 
its 
apotheosis 
of 
human 
character. 
If 
I 
had 
the 
gift 
of 
writing 
novels 
I 
should 
certainly 
not 
make 
John 
and 
Mary 
my 
characters. 
Nor 
should 
I 
transfer 
my 
loving 
pair 
to 
the 
Nile, 
nor 
to 
the 
age 
of 
the 
old 
Egyptian 
Pharaohs, 
although 
perhaps 
I 
should 
choose 
that 
time 
in 
preference 
to 
the 
present. 
For 
I 
must 
candidly 
confess 
that 
I 
hate 
the 
rubbish 
of 
history, 
interesting 
though 
it 
may 
be 
as 
a 
mere 
phenomenon, 
because 
we 
cannot 
simply 
observe 
it 
but 
must 
also 
feel 
it, 
because 
it 
comes 
to 
us 
mostly 
with 
supercilious 
arrogance, 
mostly 
unvanquished. 
The 
hero 
of 
my 
novel 
would 
be 
a 
cockchafer, 
venturing 
forth 
in 
his 
fifth 
year 
for 
the 
first 
time 
with 
his 
newly 
grown 
wings 
into 
the 
light, 
free 
air. 
Truly 
it 
could 
do 
no 
harm 
if 
man 
would 
thus 
throw 
off 
his 
inherited 
and 
acquired 
narrowness 
of 
mind 
by 
making 
himself 
acquainted 
with 
the 
world-view 
of 
allied 
creatures. 
He 
could 
not 
help 
gaining 
incomparably 
more 
in 
this 
way 
than 
the 
inhabitant 
of 
a 
small 
town 
would 
in 
circumnavigating 
the 
globe 
and 
getting 
acquainted 
with 
the 
views 
of 
strange 
peoples. 


I 
have 
now 
conducted 
you, 
by 
many 
paths 
and 
by-ways, 
rapidly 
over 
hedge 
and 
ditch, 
to 
show 
you 
what 
wide 
vistas 
we 
may 
reach 
in 
every 
field 
by 
the 
rigorous 
pursuit 
of 
a 
single 
scientific 
fact. 
A 
close 
examination 
of 
the 
two 
eyes 
of 
man 
has 
conducted 
us 
not 
only 
into 
the 
dim 
recesses 
of 
humanity's 



childhood, 
but 
has 
also 
carried 
us 
far 
beyond 
the 
bourne 
of 
human 
life. 


It 
has 
surely 
often 
struck 
you 
as 
strange 
that 
the 
sciences 
are 
divided 
into 
two 
great 
groups; 
that 
the 
so-called 
humanistic 
sciences, 
belonging 
to 
the 
so-
called 
"higher 
education," 
are 
placed 
in 
almost 
a 
hostile 
attitude 
to 
the 
natural 
sciences. 


I 
must 
confess 
I 
do 
not 
overmuch 
believe 
in 
this 
partition 
of 
the 
sciences. 
I 
believe 
that 
this 
view 
will 
appear 
as 
childlike 
and 
ingenuous 
to 
a 
matured 
age 
as 
the 
want 
of 
perspective 
in 
the 
old 
paintings 
of 
Egypt 
does 
to 
us. 
Can 
it 
really 
be 
that 
"higher 
culture" 
is 
to 
be 
gotten 
only 
from 
a 
few 
old 
pots 
and 
palimpsests, 
which 
are 
at 
best 
mere 
scraps 
of 
nature, 
or 
that 
more 
is 
to 
be 
learned 
from 
them 
alone 
than 
from 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
nature? 
I 
believe 
that 
both 
these 
sciences 
are 
simply 
parts 
of 
the 
same 
science, 
which 
have 
begun 
at 
different 
ends. 
If 
these 
two 
ends 
still 
act 
towards 
each 
other 
as 
the 
Montagues 
and 
Capulets, 
if 
their 
retainers 
still 
indulge 
in 
lively 
tilts, 
I 
believe 
that 
after 
all 
they 
are 
not 
in 
earnest. 
On 
the 
one 
side 
there 
is 
surely 
a 
Romeo, 
and 
on 
the 
other 
a 
Juliet, 
who, 
some 
day, 
it 
is 
hoped, 
will 
unite 
the 
two 
houses 
with 
a 
less 
tragic 
sequel 
than 
that 
of 
the 
play. 


Philology 
began 
with 
the 
unqualified 
reverence 
and 
apotheosis 
of 
the 
Greeks. 
Now 
it 
has 
begun 
to 
draw 
other 
languages, 
other 
peoples 
and 
their 
histories, 
into 
its 
sphere; 
it 
has, 
through 
the 
mediation 
of 
comparative 
linguistics, 
already 
struck 
up, 
though 
as 
yet 
somewhat 
cautiously, 
a 
friendship 
with 
physiology. 


Physical 
science 
began 
in 
the 
witch's 
kitchen. 
It 
now 
embraces 
the 
organic 
and 
inorganic 
worlds, 
and 
with 
the 
physiology 
of 
articulation 
and 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
senses, 
has 
even 
pushed 
its 
researches, 
at 
times 
impertinently, 
into 
the 
province 
of 
mental 
phenomena. 


In 
short, 
we 
come 
to 
the 
understanding 
of 
much 
within 
us 
solely 
by 
directing 
our 
glance 
without, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Every 
object 
belongs 
to 
both 
sciences. 
You, 
ladies, 
are 
very 
interesting 
and 
difficult 
problems 
for 
the 
psychologist, 
but 
you 
are 
also 
extremely 
pretty 
phenomena 
of 
nature. 
Church 
and 
State 
are 
objects 
of 
the 
historian's 
research, 
but 
not 
less 
phenomena 
of 
nature, 
and 
in 
part, 
indeed, 
very 
curious 
phenomena. 
If 
the 
historical 
sciences 
have 
inaugurated 
wide 
extensions 
of 
view 
by 
presenting 
to 
us 
the 
thoughts 
of 
new 



and 
strange 
peoples, 
the 
physical 
sciences 
in 
a 
certain 
sense 
do 
this 
in 
a 
still 
greater 
degree. 
In 
making 
man 
disappear 
in 
the 
All, 
in 
annihilating 
him, 
so 
to 
speak, 
they 
force 
him 
to 
take 
an 
unprejudiced 
position 
without 
himself, 
and 
to 
form 
his 
judgments 
by 
a 
different 
standard 
from 
that 
of 
the 
petty 
human. 


But 
if 
you 
should 
ask 
me 
now 
why 
man 
has 
two 
eyes, 
I 
should 
answer: 


That 
he 
may 
look 
at 
nature 
justly 
and 
accurately; 
that 
he 
may 
come 
to 
understand 
that 
he 
himself, 
with 
all 
his 
views, 
correct 
and 
incorrect, 
with 
all 
his 
haute 
politique, 
is 
simply 
an 
evanescent 
shred 
of 
nature; 
that, 
to 
speak 
with 
Mephistopheles, 
he 
is 
a 
part 
of 
the 
part, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
absolutely 
unjustified, 


"For 
man, 
the 
microcosmic 
fool, 
to 
see 
Himself 
a 
whole 
so 
frequently." 



ON 
SYMMETRY. 


[19] 


An 
ancient 
philosopher 
once 
remarked 
that 
people 
who 
cudgelled 
their 
brains 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
moon 
reminded 
him 
of 
men 
who 
discussed 
the 
laws 
and 
institutions 
of 
a 
distant 
city 
of 
which 
they 
had 
heard 
no 
more 
than 
the 
name. 
The 
true 
philosopher, 
he 
said, 
should 
turn 
his 
glance 
within, 
should 
study 
himself 
and 
his 
notions 
of 
right 
and 
wrong; 
only 
thence 
could 
he 
derive 
real 
profit. 


This 
ancient 
formula 
for 
happiness 
might 
be 
restated 
in 
the 
familiar 
words 
of 
the 
Psalm: 


"Dwell 
in 
the 
land, 
and 
verily 
thou 
shalt 
be 
fed." 


To-day, 
if 
he 
could 
rise 
from 
the 
dead 
and 
walk 
about 
among 
us, 
this 
philosopher 
would 
marvel 
much 
at 
the 
different 
turn 
which 
matters 
have 
taken. 


The 
motions 
of 
the 
moon 
and 
the 
other 
heavenly 
bodies 
are 
accurately 
known. 
Our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
motions 
of 
our 
own 
body 
is 
by 
far 
not 
so 
complete. 
The 
mountains 
and 
natural 
divisions 
of 
the 
moon 
have 
been 
accurately 
outlined 
on 
maps, 
but 
physiologists 
are 
just 
beginning 
to 
find 
their 
way 
in 
the 
geography 
of 
the 
brain. 
The 
chemical 
constitution 
of 
many 
fixed 
stars 
has 
already 
been 
investigated. 
The 
chemical 
processes 
of 
the 
animal 
body 
are 
questions 
of 
much 
greater 
difficulty 
and 
complexity. 
We 
have 
our 
Mécanique 
céleste. 
But 
a 
Mécanique 
sociale 
or 
a 
Mécanique 
morale 
of 
equal 
trustworthiness 
remains 
to 
be 
written. 


Our 
philosopher 
would 
indeed 
admit 
that 
we 
have 
made 
great 
progress. 
But 
we 
have 
not 
followed 
his 
advice. 
The 
patient 
has 
recovered, 
but 
he 
took 
for 
his 
recovery 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
the 
doctor 
prescribed. 


Humanity 
is 
now 
returned, 
much 
wiser, 
from 
its 
journey 
in 
celestial 
space, 



against 
which 
it 
was 
so 
solemnly 
warned. 
Men, 
after 
having 
become 
acquainted 
with 
the 
great 
and 
simple 
facts 
of 
the 
world 
without, 
are 
now 
beginning 
to 
examine 
critically 
the 
world 
within. 
It 
sounds 
absurd, 
but 
it 
is 
true, 
that 
only 
after 
we 
have 
thought 
about 
the 
moon 
are 
we 
able 
to 
take 
up 
ourselves. 
It 
was 
necessary 
that 
we 
should 
acquire 
simple 
and 
clear 
ideas 
in 
a 
less 
complicated 
domain, 
before 
we 
entered 
the 
more 
intricate 
one 
of 
psychology, 
and 
with 
these 
ideas 
astronomy 
principally 
furnished 
us. 


To 
attempt 
any 
description 
of 
that 
stupendous 
movement, 
which, 
originally 
springing 
out 
of 
the 
physical 
sciences, 
went 
beyond 
the 
domain 
of 
physics 
and 
is 
now 
occupied 
with 
the 
problems 
of 
psychology, 
would 
be 
presumptuous 
in 
this 
place. 
I 
shall 
only 
attempt 
here, 
to 
illustrate 
to 
you 
by 
a 
few 
simple 
examples 
the 
methods 
by 
which 
the 
province 
of 
psychology 
can 
be 
reached 
from 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
physical 
world—especially 
the 
adjacent 
province 
of 
sense-perception. 
And 
I 
wish 
it 
to 
be 
remembered 
that 
my 
brief 
attempt 
is 
not 
to 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
present 
state 
of 
such 
scientific 
questions. 


It 
is 
a 
well-known 
fact 
that 
some 
objects 
please 
us, 
while 
others 
do 
not. 
Generally 
speaking, 
anything 
that 
is 
constructed 
according 
to 
fixed 
and 
logically 
followed 
rules, 
is 
a 
product 
of 
tolerable 
beauty. 
We 
see 
thus 
nature 
herself, 
who 
always 
acts 
according 
to 
fixed 
rules, 
constantly 
producing 
such 
pretty 
things. 
Every 
day 
the 
physicist 
is 
confronted 
in 
his 
workshop 
with 
the 
most 
beautiful 
vibration-figures, 
tone-figures, 
phenomena 
of 
polarisation, 
and 
forms 
of 
diffraction. 


A 
rule 
always 
presupposes 
a 
repetition. 
Repetitions, 
therefore, 
will 
probably 
be 
found 
to 
play 
some 
important 
part 
in 
the 
production 
of 
agreeable 
effects. 
Of 
course, 
the 
nature 
of 
agreeable 
effects 
is 
not 
exhausted 
by 
this. 
Furthermore, 
the 
repetition 
of 
a 
physical 
event 
becomes 
the 
source 
of 
agreeable 
effects 
only 
when 
it 
is 
connected 
with 
a 
repetition 
of 
sensations. 


An 
excellent 
example 
that 
repetition 
of 
sensations 
is 
a 
source 
of 
agreeable 
effects 
is 
furnished 
by 
the 
copy-book 
of 
every 
schoolboy, 
which 
is 
usually 
a 
treasure-house 
of 
such 
things, 
and 
only 
in 
need 
of 
an 
Abbé 
Domenech 
to 
become 
celebrated. 
Any 
figure, 
no 
matter 
how 
crude 
or 
poor, 
if 
several 
times 
repeated, 
with 
the 
repetitions 
placed 
in 
line, 
will 
produce 
a 
tolerable 
frieze. 



Also 
the 
pleasant 
effect 
of 
symmetry 
is 
due 
to 
the 
repetition 
of 
sensations. 
Let 
us 
abandon 
ourselves 
a 
moment 
to 
this 
thought, 
yet 
not 
imagine 
when 
we 
have 
developed 
it, 
that 
we 
have 
fully 
exhausted 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
agreeable, 
much 
less 
of 
the 
beautiful. 


First, 
let 
us 
get 
a 
clear 
conception 
of 
what 
symmetry 
is. 
And 
in 
preference 
to 
a 
definition 
let 
us 
take 
a 
living 
picture. 
You 
know 
that 
the 
reflexion 
of 
an 
object 
in 
a 
mirror 
has 
a 
great 
likeness 
to 
the 
object 
itself. 
All 
its 
proportions 
and 
outlines 
are 
the 
same. 
Yet 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
between 
the 
object 
and 
its 
reflexion 
in 
the 
mirror, 
which 
you 
will 
readily 
observe. 


Hold 
your 
right 
hand 
before 
a 
mirror, 
and 
you 
will 
see 
in 
the 
mirror 
a 
left 
hand. 
Your 
right 
glove 
will 
produce 
its 
mate 
in 
the 
glass. 
For 
you 
could 
never 
use 
the 
reflexion 
of 
your 
right 
glove, 
if 
it 
were 
present 
to 
you 
as 
a 
real 
thing, 
for 
covering 
your 
right 
hand, 
but 
only 
for 
covering 
your 
left. 
Similarly, 
your 
right 
ear 
will 
give 
as 
its 
reflexion 
a 
left 
ear; 
and 
you 
will 
at 
once 
perceive 
that 
the 
left 
half 
of 
your 
body 
could 
very 
easily 
be 
substituted 
for 
the 
reflexion 
of 
your 
right 
half. 
Now 
just 
as 
in 
the 
place 
of 
a 
missing 
right 
ear 
a 
left 
ear 
cannot 
be 
put, 
unless 
the 
lobule 
of 
the 
ear 
be 
turned 
upwards, 
or 
the 
opening 
into 
the 
concha 
backwards, 
so, 
despite 
all 
similarity 
of 
form, 
the 
reflexion 
of 
an 
object 
can 
never 
take 
the 
place 
of 
the 
object 
itself. 
[20] 


The 
reason 
of 
this 
difference 
between 
the 
object 
and 
its 
reflexion 
is 
simple. 
The 
reflexion 
appears 
as 
far 
behind 
the 
mirror 
as 
the 
object 
is 
in 
front 
of 
it. 
The 
parts 
of 
the 
object, 
accordingly, 
which 
are 
nearest 
the 
mirror 
will 
also 
be 
nearest 
the 
mirror 
in 
the 
reflexion. 
Consequently, 
the 
succession 
of 
the 
parts 
in 
the 
reflexion 
will 
be 
reversed, 
as 
may 
best 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
reflexion 
of 
the 
face 
of 
a 
watch 
or 
of 
a 
manuscript. 


It 
will 
also 
be 
readily 
seen, 
that 
if 
a 
point 
of 
the 
object 
be 
joined 
with 
its 
reflexion 
in 
the 
image, 
the 
line 
of 
junction 
will 
cut 
the 
mirror 
at 
right 
angles 
and 
be 
bisected 
by 
it. 
This 
holds 
true 
of 
all 
corresponding 
points 
of 
object 
and 
image. 


If, 
now, 
we 
can 
divide 
an 
object 
by 
a 
plane 
into 
two 
halves 
so 
that 
each 
half, 
as 
seen 
in 
the 
reflecting 
plane 
of 
division, 
is 
a 
reproduction 
of 
the 
other 
half, 
such 
an 
object 
is 
termed 
symmetrical, 
and 
the 
plane 
of 
division 
is 
called 
the 
plane 
of 
symmetry. 



If 
the 
plane 
of 
symmetry 
is 
vertical, 
we 
can 
say 
that 
the 
body 
is 
vertically 
symmetrical. 
An 
example 
of 
vertical 
symmetry 
is 
a 
Gothic 
cathedral. 


If 
the 
plane 
of 
symmetry 
is 
horizontal, 
we 
can 
say 
that 
the 
object 
is 
horizontally 
symmetrical. 
A 
landscape 
on 
the 
shores 
of 
a 
lake 
with 
its 
reflexion 
in 
the 
water, 
is 
a 
system 
of 
horizontal 
symmetry. 


Exactly 
here 
is 
a 
noticeable 
difference. 
The 
vertical 
symmetry 
of 
a 
Gothic 
cathedral 
strikes 
us 
at 
once, 
whereas 
we 
can 
travel 
up 
and 
down 
the 
whole 
length 
of 
the 
Rhine 
or 
the 
Hudson 
without 
becoming 
aware 
of 
the 
symmetry 
between 
objects 
and 
their 
reflexions 
in 
the 
water. 
Vertical 
symmetry 
pleases 
us, 
whilst 
horizontal 
symmetry 
is 
indifferent, 
and 
is 
noticed 
only 
by 
the 
experienced 
eye. 


Whence 
arises 
this 
difference? 
I 
say 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
vertical 
symmetry 
produces 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
same 
sensation, 
while 
horizontal 
symmetry 
does 
not. 
I 
shall 
now 
show 
that 
this 
is 
so. 


Let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
following 
letters: 


dbqp 


It 
is 
a 
fact 
known 
to 
all 
mothers 
and 
teachers, 
that 
children 
in 
their 
first 
attempts 
to 
read 
and 
write, 
constantly 
confound 
d 
and 
b, 
and 
q 
and 
p, 
but 
never 
d 
and 
q, 
or 
b 
andp. 
Now 
d 
and 
b 
and 
q 
and 
p 
are 
the 
two 
halves 
of 
a 
vertically 
symmetrical 
figure, 
while 
d 
and 
q, 
and 
b 
and 
p 
are 
two 
halves 
of 
a 
horizontally 
symmetrical 
figure. 
The 
first 
two 
are 
confounded; 
but 
confusion 
is 
only 
possible 
of 
things 
that 
excite 
in 
us 
the 
same 
or 
similar 
sensations. 


Figures 
of 
two 
flower-girls 
are 
frequently 
seen 
on 
the 
decorations 
of 
gardens 
and 
of 
drawing-rooms, 
one 
of 
whom 
carries 
a 
flower-basket 
in 
her 
right 
hand 
and 
the 
other 
a 
flower-basket 
in 
her 
left. 
All 
know 
how 
apt 
we 
are, 
unless 
we 
are 
very 
careful, 
to 
confound 
these 
figures 
with 
one 
another. 


While 
turning 
a 
thing 
round 
from 
right 
to 
left 
is 
scarcely 
noticed, 
the 
eye 
is 
not 
at 
all 
indifferent 
to 
the 
turning 
of 
a 
thing 
upside 
down. 
A 
human 
face 
which 
has 
been 
turned 
upside 
down 
is 
scarcely 
recognisable 
as 
a 
face, 
and 
makes 
an 
impression 
which 
is 
altogether 
strange. 
The 
reason 
of 
this 
is 
not 
to 



be 
sought 
in 
the 
unwontedness 
of 
the 
sight, 
for 
it 
is 
just 
as 
difficult 
to 
recognise 
an 
arabesque 
that 
has 
been 
inverted, 
where 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
a 
habit. 
This 
curious 
fact 
is 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
familiar 
jokes 
played 
with 
the 
portraits 
of 
unpopular 
personages, 
which 
are 
so 
drawn 
that 
in 
the 
upright 
position 
of 
the 
page 
an 
exact 
picture 
of 
the 
person 
is 
presented, 
but 
on 
being 
inverted 
some 
popular 
animal 
is 
shown. 


It 
is 
a 
fact, 
then, 
that 
the 
two 
halves 
of 
a 
vertically 
symmetrical 
figure 
are 
easily 
confounded 
and 
that 
they 
therefore 
probably 
produce 
very 
nearly 
the 
same 
sensations. 
The 
question, 
accordingly, 
arises, 
why 
do 
the 
two 
halves 
of 
a 
vertically 
symmetrical 
figure 
produce 
the 
same 
or 
similar 
sensations? 
The 
answer 
is: 
Because 
our 
apparatus 
of 
vision, 
which 
consists 
of 
our 
eyes 
and 
of 
the 
accompanying 
muscular 
apparatus 
is 
itself 
vertically 
symmetrical. 
[21] 


Whatever 
external 
resemblances 
one 
eye 
may 
have 
with 
another 
they 
are 
still 
not 
alike. 
The 
right 
eye 
of 
a 
man 
cannot 
take 
the 
place 
of 
a 
left 
eye 
any 
more 
than 
a 
left 
ear 
or 
left 
hand 
can 
take 
the 
place 
of 
a 
right 
one. 
By 
artificial 
means, 
we 
can 
change 
the 
part 
which 
each 
of 
our 
eyes 
plays. 
(Wheatstone's 
pseudoscope.) 
But 
we 
then 
find 
ourselves 
in 
an 
entirely 
new 
and 
strange 
world. 
What 
is 
convex 
appears 
concave; 
what 
is 
concave, 
convex. 
What 
is 
distant 
appears 
near, 
and 
what 
is 
near 
appears 
far. 


The 
left 
eye 
is 
the 
reflexion 
of 
the 
right. 
And 
the 
light-feeling 
retina 
of 
the 
left 
eye 
is 
a 
reflexion 
of 
the 
light-feeling 
retina 
of 
the 
right, 
in 
all 
its 
functions. 


The 
lense 
of 
the 
eye, 
like 
a 
magic 
lantern, 
casts 
images 
of 
objects 
on 
the 
retina. 
And 
you 
may 
picture 
to 
yourself 
the 
light-feeling 
retina 
of 
the 
eye, 
with 
its 
countless 
nerves, 
as 
a 
hand 
with 
innumerable 
fingers, 
adapted 
to 
feeling 
light. 
The 
ends 
of 
the 
visual 
nerves, 
like 
our 
fingers, 
are 
endowed 
with 
varying 
degrees 
of 
sensitiveness. 
The 
two 
retinæ 
act 
like 
a 
right 
and 
a 
left 
hand; 
the 
sensation 
of 
touch 
and 
the 
sensation 
of 
light 
in 
the 
two 
instances 
are 
similar. 


Examine 
the 
right-hand 
portion 
of 
this 
letter 
T: 
namely, 
T. 
Instead 
of 
the 
two 
retinæ 
on 
which 
this 
image 
falls, 
imagine 
feeling 
the 
object, 
my 
two 
hands. 
The 
┌, 
grasped 
with 
the 
right 
hand, 
gives 
a 
different 
sensation 
from 
that 
which 
it 
gives 
when 
grasped 
with 
the 
left. 
But 
if 
we 
turn 
our 
character 
about 



from 
right 
to 
left, 
thus: 
┐, 
it 
will 
give 
the 
same 
sensation 
in 
the 
left 
hand 
that 
it 
gave 
before 
in 
the 
right. 
The 
sensation 
is 
repeated. 


If 
we 
take 
a 
whole 
T, 
the 
right 
half 
will 
produce 
in 
the 
right 
hand 
the 
same 
sensation 
that 
the 
left 
half 
produces 
in 
the 
left, 
and 
vice 
versa. 


The 
symmetrical 
figure 
gives 
the 
same 
sensation 
twice. 


If 
we 
turn 
the 
T 
over 
thus: 
├, 
or 
invert 
the 
half 
T 
thus: 
L, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
do 
not 
change 
the 
position 
of 
our 
hands 
we 
can 
make 
no 
use 
of 
the 
foregoing 
reasoning. 


The 
retinæ, 
in 
fact, 
are 
exactly 
like 
our 
two 
hands. 
They, 
too, 
have 
their 
thumbs 
and 
index 
fingers, 
though 
they 
are 
thousands 
in 
number; 
and 
we 
may 
say 
the 
thumbs 
are 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
eye 
near 
the 
nose, 
and 
the 
remaining 
fingers 
on 
the 
side 
away 
from 
the 
nose. 


With 
this 
I 
hope 
to 
have 
made 
perfectly 
clear 
that 
the 
pleasing 
effect 
of 
symmetry 
is 
chiefly 
due 
to 
the 
repetition 
of 
sensations, 
and 
that 
the 
effect 
in 
question 
takes 
place 
in 
symmetrical 
figures, 
only 
where 
there 
is 
a 
repetition 
of 
sensation. 
The 
pleasing 
effect 
of 
regular 
figures, 
the 
preference 
which 
straight 
lines, 
especially 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
straight 
lines, 
enjoy, 
is 
founded 
on 
a 
similar 
reason. 
A 
straight 
line, 
both 
in 
a 
horizontal 
and 
in 
a 
vertical 
position, 
can 
cast 
on 
the 
two 
retinæ 
the 
same 
image, 
which 
falls 
moreover 
on 
symmetrically 
corresponding 
spots. 
This 
also, 
it 
would 
appear, 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
our 
psychological 
preference 
of 
straight 
to 
curved 
lines, 
and 
not 
their 
property 
of 
being 
the 
shortest 
distance 
between 
two 
points. 
The 
straight 
line 
is 
felt, 
to 
put 
the 
matter 
briefly, 
as 
symmetrical 
to 
itself, 
which 
is 
the 
case 
also 
with 
the 
plane. 
Curved 
lines 
are 
felt 
as 
deviations 
from 
straight 
lines, 
that 
is, 
as 
deviations 
from 
symmetry. 
[22] 
The 
presence 
of 
a 
sense 
for 
symmetry 
in 
people 
possessing 
only 
one 
eye 
from 
birth, 
is 
indeed 
a 
riddle. 
Of 
course, 
the 
sense 
of 
symmetry, 
although 
primarily 
acquired 
by 
means 
of 
the 
eyes, 
cannot 
be 
wholly 
limited 
to 
the 
visual 
organs. 
It 
must 
also 
be 
deeply 
rooted 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
organism 
by 
ages 
of 
practice 
and 
can 
thus 
not 
be 
eliminated 
forthwith 
by 
the 
loss 
of 
one 
eye. 
Also, 
when 
an 
eye 
is 
lost, 
the 
symmetrical 
muscular 
apparatus 
is 
left, 
as 
is 
also 
the 
symmetrical 
apparatus 
of 
innervation. 



It 
appears, 
however, 
unquestionable 
that 
the 
phenomena 
mentioned 
have, 
in 
the 
main, 
their 
origin 
in 
the 
peculiar 
structure 
of 
our 
eyes. 
It 
will 
therefore 
be 
seen 
at 
once 
that 
our 
notions 
of 
what 
is 
beautiful 
and 
ugly 
would 
undergo 
a 
change 
if 
our 
eyes 
were 
different. 
Also, 
if 
this 
view 
is 
correct, 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
so-called 
eternally 
beautiful 
is 
somewhat 
mistaken. 
It 
can 
scarcely 
be 
doubted 
that 
our 
culture, 
or 
form 
of 
civilisation, 
which 
stamps 
upon 
the 
human 
body 
its 
unmistakable 
traces, 
should 
not 
also 
modify 
our 
conceptions 
of 
the 
beautiful. 
Was 
not 
formerly 
the 
development 
of 
all 
musical 
beauty 
restricted 
to 
the 
narrow 
limits 
of 
a 
five-toned 
scale? 


The 
fact 
that 
a 
repetition 
of 
sensations 
is 
productive 
of 
pleasant 
effects 
is 
not 
restricted 
to 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
visible. 
To-day, 
both 
the 
musician 
and 
the 
physicist 
know 
that 
the 
harmonic 
or 
the 
melodic 
addition 
of 
one 
tone 
to 
another 
affects 
us 
agreeably 
only 
when 
the 
added 
tone 
reproduces 
a 
part 
of 
the 
sensation 
which 
the 
first 
one 
excited. 
When 
I 
add 
an 
octave 
to 
a 
fundamental 
tone, 
I 
hear 
in 
the 
octave 
a 
part 
of 
what 
was 
heard 
in 
the 
fundamental 
tone. 
(Helmholtz.) 
But 
it 
is 
not 
my 
purpose 
to 
develop 
this 
idea 
fully 
here. 
[23] 
We 
shall 
only 
ask 
to-day, 
whether 
there 
is 
anything 
similar 
to 
the 
symmetry 
of 
figures 
in 
the 
province 
of 
sounds. 


Look 
at 
the 
reflexion 
of 
your 
piano 
in 
the 
mirror. 


You 
will 
at 
once 
remark 
that 
you 
have 
never 
seen 
such 
a 
piano 
in 
the 
actual 
world, 
for 
it 
has 
its 
high 
keys 
to 
the 
left 
and 
its 
low 
ones 
to 
the 
right. 
Such 
pianos 
are 
not 
manufactured. 


If 
you 
could 
sit 
down 
at 
such 
a 
piano 
and 
play 
in 
your 
usual 
manner, 
plainly 
every 
step 
which 
you 
imagined 
you 
were 
performing 
in 
the 
upward 
scale 
would 
be 
executed 
as 
a 
corresponding 
step 
in 
the 
downward 
scale. 
The 
effect 
would 
be 
not 
a 
little 
surprising. 


For 
the 
practised 
musician 
who 
is 
always 
accustomed 
to 
hearing 
certain 
sounds 
produced 
when 
certain 
keys 
are 
struck, 
it 
is 
quite 
an 
anomalous 
spectacle 
to 
watch 
a 
player 
in 
the 
glass 
and 
to 
observe 
that 
he 
always 
does 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
we 
hear. 


But 
still 
more 
remarkable 
would 
be 
the 
effect 
of 
attempting 
to 
strike 
a 
harmony 
on 
such 
a 
piano. 
For 
a 
melody 
it 
is 
not 
indifferent 
whether 
we 



execute 
a 
step 
in 
an 
upward 
or 
a 
downward 
scale. 
But 
for 
a 
harmony, 
so 
great 
a 
difference 
is 
not 
produced 
by 
reversal. 
I 
always 
retain 
the 
same 
consonance 
whether 
I 
add 
to 
a 
fundamental 
note 
an 
upper 
or 
a 
lower 
third. 
Only 
the 
order 
of 
the 
intervals 
of 
the 
harmony 
is 
reversed. 
In 
point 
of 
fact, 
when 
we 
execute 
a 
movement 
in 
a 
major 
key 
on 
our 
reflected 
piano, 
we 
hear 
a 
sound 
in 
a 
minor 
key, 
and 
vice 
versa. 


It 
now 
remains 
to 
execute 
the 
experiments 
indicated. 
Instead 
of 
playing 
upon 
the 
piano 
in 
the 
mirror, 
which 
is 
impossible, 
or 
of 
having 
a 
piano 
of 
this 
kind 
built, 
which 
would 
be 
somewhat 
expensive, 
we 
may 
perform 
our 
experiments 
in 
a 
simpler 
manner, 
as 
follows: 


1) 
We 
play 
on 
our 
own 
piano 
in 
our 
usual 
manner, 
look 
into 
the 
mirror, 
and 
then 
repeat 
on 
our 
real 
piano 
what 
we 
see 
in 
the 
mirror. 
In 
this 
way 
we 
transform 
all 
steps 
upwards 
into 
corresponding 
steps 
downwards. 
We 
play 
a 
movement, 
and 
then 
another 
movement, 
which, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
keyboard, 
is 
symmetrical 
to 
the 
first. 
2) 
We 
place 
a 
mirror 
beneath 
the 
music 
in 
which 
the 
notes 
are 
reflected 
as 
in 
a 
body 
of 
water, 
and 
play 
according 
to 
the 
notes 
in 
the 
mirror. 
In 
this 
way 
also, 
all 
steps 
upwards 
are 
changed 
into 
corresponding, 
equal 
steps 
downwards. 
3) 
We 
turn 
the 
music 
upside 
down 
and 
read 
the 
notes 
from 
right 
to 
left 
and 
from 
below 
upwards. 
In 
doing 
this, 
we 
must 
regard 
all 
sharps 
as 
flats 
and 
all 
flats 
as 
sharps, 
because 
they 
correspond 
to 
half 
lines 
and 
spaces. 
Besides, 
in 
this 
use 
of 
the 
music 
we 
can 
only 
employ 
the 
bass 
clef, 
as 
only 
in 
this 
clef 
are 
the 
notes 
not 
changed 
by 
symmetrical 
reversal. 
You 
can 
judge 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
these 
experiments 
from 
the 
examples 
which 
appear 
in 
the 
annexed 
musical 
cut. 
(Page 
102.) 
The 
movement 
which 
appears 
in 
the 
upper 
lines 
is 
symmetrically 
reversed 
in 
the 
lower. 


The 
effect 
of 
the 
experiments 
may 
be 
briefly 
formulated. 
The 
melody 
is 
rendered 
unrecognisable. 
The 
harmony 
suffers 
a 
transposition 
from 
a 
major 
into 
a 
minor 
key 
and 
vice 
versa. 
The 
study 
of 
these 
pretty 
effects, 
which 
have 
long 
been 
familiar 
to 
physicists 
and 
musicians, 
was 
revived 
some 
years 
ago 
by 
Von 
Oettingen. 
[24] 



(See 
pages 
101 
and 
103.)] 


Now, 
although 
in 
all 
the 
preceding 
examples 
I 
have 
transposed 
steps 
upward 
into 
equal 
and 
similar 
steps 
downward, 
that 
is, 
as 
we 
may 
justly 
say, 
have 
played 
for 
every 
movement 
the 
movement 
which 
is 
symmetrical 
to 
it, 
yet 
the 
ear 
notices 
either 
little 
or 
nothing 
of 
symmetry. 
The 
transposition 
from 
a 
major 
to 
a 
minor 
key 
is 
the 
sole 
indication 
of 
symmetry 
remaining. 
The 
symmetry 
is 
there 
for 
the 
mind, 
but 
is 
wanting 
for 
sensation. 
No 
symmetry 
exists 
for 
the 
ear, 
because 
a 
reversal 
of 
musical 
sounds 
conditions 
no 
repetition 
of 
sensations. 
If 
we 
had 
an 
ear 
for 
height 
and 
an 
ear 
for 
depth, 
just 
as 
we 
have 
an 
eye 
for 
the 
right 
and 
an 
eye 
for 
the 
left, 
we 
should 
also 
find 
that 
symmetrical 
sound-structures 
existed 
for 
our 
auditory 
organs. 
The 
contrast 
of 
major 
and 
minor 
for 
the 
ear 
corresponds 
to 
inversion 
for 
the 
eye, 
which 
is 
also 
only 
symmetry 
for 
the 
mind, 
but 
not 
for 
sensation. 


By 
way 
of 
supplement 
to 
what 
I 
have 
said, 
I 
will 
add 
a 
brief 
remark 
for 
my 
mathematical 
readers. 


Our 
musical 
notation 
is 
essentially 
a 
graphical 
representation 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
music 
in 
the 
form 
of 
curves, 
where 
the 
time 
is 
the 
abscissæ, 
and 
the 
logarithms 
of 
the 
number 
of 
vibrations 
the 
ordinates. 
The 
deviations 
of 
musical 
notation 
from 
this 
principle 
are 
only 
such 
as 
facilitate 
interpretation, 
or 
are 
due 
to 
historical 
accidents. 


If, 
now, 
it 
be 
further 
observed 
that 
the 
sensation 
of 
pitch 
also 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
logarithm 
of 
the 
number 
of 
vibrations, 
and 
that 
the 
intervals 
between 
the 
notes 
correspond 
to 
the 
differences 
of 
the 
logarithms 
of 
the 
numbers 
of 
vibrations, 
the 
justification 
will 
be 
found 
in 
these 
facts 
of 
calling 
the 
harmonies 
and 
melodies 
which 
appear 
in 
the 
mirror, 
symmetrical 
to 
the 
original 
ones. 


I 
simply 
wish 
to 
bring 
home 
to 
your 
minds 
by 
these 
fragmentary 
remarks 
that 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
physical 
sciences 
has 
been 
of 
great 
help 
to 
those 
branches 
of 
psychology 
that 
have 
not 
scorned 
to 
consider 
the 
results 
of 
physical 
research. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
psychology 
is 
beginning 
to 
return, 
as 
it 
were, 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
thankfulness, 
the 
powerful 
stimulus 
which 
it 
received 
from 
physics. 



The 
theories 
of 
physics 
which 
reduce 
all 
phenomena 
to 
the 
motion 
and 
equilibrium 
of 
smallest 
particles, 
the 
so-called 
molecular 
theories, 
have 
been 
gravely 
threatened 
by 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
senses 
and 
of 
space, 
and 
we 
may 
say 
that 
their 
days 
are 
numbered. 


I 
have 
shown 
elsewhere 
[25] 
that 
the 
musical 
scale 
is 
simply 
a 
species 
of 
space 
—a 
space, 
however, 
of 
only 
one 
dimension, 
and 
that, 
a 
one-sided 
one. 
If, 
now, 
a 
person 
who 
could 
only 
hear, 
should 
attempt 
to 
develop 
a 
conception 
of 
the 
world 
in 
this, 
his 
linear 
space, 
he 
would 
become 
involved 
in 
many 
difficulties, 
as 
his 
space 
would 
be 
incompetent 
to 
comprehend 
the 
many 
sides 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
reality. 
But 
is 
it 
any 
more 
justifiable 
for 
us, 
to 
attempt 
to 
force 
the 
whole 
world 
into 
the 
space 
of 
our 
eye, 
in 
aspects 
in 
which 
it 
is 
not 
accessible 
to 
the 
eye? 
Yet 
this 
is 
the 
dilemma 
of 
all 
molecular 
theories. 


We 
possess, 
however, 
a 
sense, 
which, 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
relations 
which 
it 
can 
comprehend, 
is 
richer 
than 
any 
other. 
It 
is 
our 
reason. 
This 
stands 
above 
the 
senses. 
It 
alone 
is 
competent 
to 
found 
a 
permanent 
and 
sufficient 
view 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
mechanical 
conception 
of 
the 
world 
has 
performed 
wonders 
since 
Galileo's 
time. 
But 
it 
must 
now 
yield 
to 
a 
broader 
view 
of 
things. 
A 
further 
development 
of 
this 
idea 
is 
beyond 
the 
limits 
of 
my 
present 
purpose. 


One 
more 
point 
and 
I 
have 
done. 
The 
advice 
of 
our 
philosopher 
to 
restrict 
ourselves 
to 
what 
is 
near 
at 
hand 
and 
useful 
in 
our 
researches, 
which 
finds 
a 
kind 
of 
exemplification 
in 
the 
present 
cry 
of 
inquirers 
for 
limitation 
and 
division 
of 
labor, 
must 
not 
be 
too 
slavishly 
followed. 
In 
the 
seclusion 
of 
our 
closets, 
we 
often 
rack 
our 
brains 
in 
vain 
to 
fulfil 
a 
work, 
the 
means 
of 
accomplishing 
which 
lies 
before 
our 
very 
doors. 
If 
the 
inquirer 
must 
be 
perforce 
a 
shoemaker, 
tapping 
constantly 
at 
his 
last, 
it 
may 
perhaps 
be 
permitted 
him 
to 
be 
a 
shoemaker 
of 
the 
type 
of 
Hans 
Sachs, 
who 
did 
not 
deem 
it 
beneath 
him 
to 
take 
a 
look 
now 
and 
then 
at 
his 
neighbor's 
work 
and 
to 
comment 
on 
the 
latter's 
doings. 


Let 
this 
be 
my 
apology, 
therefore, 
if 
I 
have 
forsaken 
for 
a 
moment 
to-day 
the 
last 
of 
my 
specialty. 



ON 
THE 
FUNDAMENTAL 
CONCEPTS 
OF 
ELECTROSTATICS. 
[26] 


The 
task 
has 
been 
assigned 
me 
to 
develop 
before 
you 
in 
a 
popular 
manner 
the 
fundamental 
quantitative 
concepts 
of 
electrostatics—"quantity 
of 
electricity," 
"potential," 
"capacity," 
and 
so 
forth. 
It 
would 
not 
be 
difficult, 
even 
within 
the 
brief 
limits 
of 
an 
hour, 
to 
delight 
the 
eye 
with 
hosts 
of 
beautiful 
experiments 
and 
to 
fill 
the 
imagination 
with 
numerous 
and 
varied 
conceptions. 
But 
we 
should, 
in 
such 
a 
case, 
be 
still 
far 
from 
a 
lucid 
and 
easy 
grasp 
of 
the 
phenomena. 
The 
means 
would 
still 
fail 
us 
for 
reproducing 
the 
facts 
accurately 
in 
thought—a 
procedure 
which 
for 
the 
theoretical 
and 
practical 
man 
is 
of 
equal 
importance. 
These 
means 
are 
the 
metrical 
concepts 
of 
electricity. 


As 
long 
as 
the 
pursuit 
of 
the 
facts 
of 
a 
given 
province 
of 
phenomena 
is 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
few 
isolated 
investigators, 
as 
long 
as 
every 
experiment 
can 
be 
easily 
repeated, 
the 
fixing 
of 
the 
collected 
facts 
by 
provisional 
description 
is 
ordinarily 
sufficient. 
But 
the 
case 
is 
different 
when 
the 
whole 
world 
must 
make 
use 
of 
the 
results 
reached 
by 
many, 
as 
happens 
when 
the 
science 
acquires 
broader 
foundations 
and 
scope, 
and 
particularly 
so 
when 
it 
begins 
to 
supply 
intellectual 
nourishment 
to 
an 
important 
branch 
of 
the 
practical 
arts, 
and 
to 
draw 
from 
that 
province 
in 
return 
stupendous 
empirical 
results. 
Then 
the 
facts 
must 
be 
so 
described 
that 
individuals 
in 
all 
places 
and 
at 
all 
times 
can, 
from 
a 
few 
easily 
obtained 
elements, 
put 
the 
facts 
accurately 
together 
in 
thought, 
and 
reproduce 
them 
from 
the 
description. 
This 
is 
done 
with 
the 
help 
of 
the 
metrical 
concepts 
and 
the 
international 
measures. 


The 
work 
which 
was 
begun 
in 
this 
direction 
in 
the 
period 
of 
the 
purely 
scientific 
development 
of 
the 
science, 
especially 
by 
Coulomb 
(1784), 
Gauss 
(1833), 
and 
Weber 
(1846), 
was 
powerfully 
stimulated 
by 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
great 
technical 
undertakings 
manifested 
since 
the 
laying 
of 
the 
first 
transatlantic 
cable, 
and 
brought 
to 
a 
brilliant 
conclusion 
by 
the 
labors 
of 
the 
British 
Association, 
1861, 
and 
of 
the 
Paris 
Congress, 
1881, 
chiefly 
through 
the 
exertions 
of 
Sir 
William 
Thomson. 



It 
is 
plain, 
that 
in 
the 
time 
allotted 
to 
me 
I 
cannot 
conduct 
you 
over 
all 
the 
long 
and 
tortuous 
paths 
which 
the 
science 
has 
actually 
pursued, 
that 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
at 
every 
step 
to 
remind 
you 
of 
all 
the 
little 
precautions 
for 
the 
avoidance 
of 
error 
which 
the 
early 
steps 
have 
taught 
us. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
I 
must 
make 
shift 
with 
the 
simplest 
and 
rudest 
tools. 
I 
shall 
conduct 
you 
by 
the 
shortest 
paths 
from 
the 
facts 
to 
the 
ideas, 
in 
doing 
which, 
of 
course, 
it 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
anticipate 
all 
the 
stray 
and 
chance 
ideas 
which 
may 
and 
must 
arise 
from 
prospects 
into 
the 
by-paths 
which 
we 
leave 
untrodden. 


Here 
are 
two 
small, 
light 
bodies 
(Fig. 
27) 
of 
equal 
size, 
freely 
suspended, 
which 
we 
"electrify" 
either 
by 
friction 
with 
a 
third 
body 
or 
by 
contact 
with 
a 
body 
already 
electrified. 
At 
once 
a 
repulsive 
force 
is 
set 
up 
which 
drives 
the 
two 
bodies 
away 
from 
each 
other 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
action 
of 
gravity. 
This 
force 
could 
accomplish 
anew 
the 
same 
mechanical 
work 
which 
was 
expended 
to 
produce 
it. 
[27] 


Coulomb, 
now, 
by 
means 
of 
delicate 
experiments 
with 
the 
torsion-balance, 
satisfied 
himself 
that 
if 
the 
bodies 
in 
question, 
say 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
two 
centimetres, 
repelled 
each 
other 
with 
the 
same 
force 
with 
which 
a 
milligramme-weight 
strives 
to 
fall 
to 
the 
ground, 
at 
half 
that 
distance, 
or 
at 
one 
centimetre, 
they 
would 
repel 
each 
other 
with 
the 
force 
of 
four 
milligrammes, 
and 
at 
double 
that 
distance, 
or 
at 
four 
centimetres, 
they 
would 
repel 
each 
other 
with 
the 
force 
of 
only 
one-fourth 
of 
a 
milligramme. 
He 
found 
that 
the 
electrical 
force 
acts 
inversely 
as 
the 
square 
of 
the 
distance. 


Let 
us 
imagine, 
now, 
that 
we 
possessed 
some 
means 
of 
measuring 
electrical 
repulsion 
by 
weights, 
a 
means 
which 
would 
be 
supplied, 
for 
example, 
by 
our 
electrical 
pendulums; 
then 
we 
could 
make 
the 
following 
observation. 


The 
body 
A 
(Fig. 
28) 
is 
repelled 
by 
the 
body 
K 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
two 
centimetres 
with 
a 
force 
of 
one 
milligramme. 
If 
we 
touch 
A, 
now, 
with 
an 
equal 
body 
B, 
the 
half 
of 
this 
force 
of 
repulsion 
will 
pass 
to 
the 
body 
B; 
both 
A 
and 
B, 
now, 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
two 
centimetres 
from 
K, 
are 
repelled 
only 
with 
the 
force 
of 
one-half 
a 
milligramme. 
But 
both 
together 
are 
repelled 
still 
with 
the 
force 
of 
one 
milligramme. 
Hence, 
the 
divisibility 
of 
electrical 
force 
among 
bodies 
in 
contact 
is 
a 
fact. 
It 
is 
a 
useful, 
but 
by 
no 
means 
a 
necessary 



supplement 
to 
this 
fact, 
to 
imagine 
an 
electrical 
fluid 
present 
in 
the 
body 
A, 
with 
the 
quantity 
of 
which 
the 
electrical 
force 
varies, 
and 
half 
of 
which 
flows 
over 
to 
B. 
For, 
in 
the 
place 
of 
the 
new 
physical 
picture, 
thus, 
an 
old, 
familiar 
one 
is 
substituted, 
which 
moves 
spontaneously 
in 
its 
wonted 
courses. 


Adhering 
to 
this 
idea, 
we 
define 
the 
unit 
of 
electrical 
quantity, 
according 
to 
the 
now 
almost 
universally 
adopted 
centimetre-gramme-second 
(C. 
G. 
S.) 
system, 
as 
that 
quantity 
which 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
one 
centimetre 
repels 
an 
equal 
quantity 
with 
unit 
of 
force, 
that 
is, 
with 
a 
force 
which 
in 
one 
second 
would 
impart 
to 
a 
mass 
of 
one 
gramme 
a 
velocity-increment 
of 
a 
centimetre. 
As 
a 
gramme 
mass 
acquires 
through 
the 
action 
of 
gravity 
a 
velocity-increment 
of 
about 
981 
centimetres 
in 
a 
second, 
accordingly, 
a 
gramme 
is 
attracted 
to 
the 
earth 
with 
981, 
or, 
in 
round 
numbers, 
1000 
units 
of 
force 
of 
the 
centimetregramme-
second 
system, 
while 
a 
milligramme-weight 
would 
strive 
to 
fall 
to 
the 
earth 
with 
approximately 
the 
unit 
force 
of 
this 
system. 


We 
may 
easily 
obtain 
by 
this 
means 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
what 
the 
unit 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
is. 
Two 
small 
bodies, 
K, 
weighing 
each 
a 
gramme, 
are 
hung 
up 
by 
vertical 
threads, 
five 
metres 
in 
length 
and 
almost 
weightless, 
so 
as 
to 
touch 
each 
other. 
If 
the 
two 
bodies 
be 
equally 
electrified 
and 
move 
apart 
upon 
electrification 
to 
a 
distance 
of 
one 
centimetre, 
their 
charge 
is 
approximately 
equivalent 
to 
the 
electrostatic 
unit 
of 
electric 
quantity, 
for 
the 
repulsion 
then 
holds 
in 
equilibrium 
a 
gravitational 
force-component 
of 
approximately 
one 
milligramme, 
which 
strives 
to 
bring 
the 
bodies 
together. 


Vertically 
beneath 
a 
small 
sphere 
suspended 
from 
the 
equilibrated 
beam 
of 
a 
balance 
a 
second 
sphere 
is 
placed 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
a 
centimetre. 
If 
both 
be 
equally 
electrified 
the 
sphere 
suspended 
from 
the 
balance 
will 
be 
rendered 
apparently 
lighter 
by 
the 
repulsion. 
If 
by 
adding 
a 
weight 
of 
one 
milligramme 
equilibrium 
is 
restored, 
each 
of 
the 
spheres 
contains 
in 
round 
numbers 
the 
electrostatic 
unit 
of 
electrical 
quantity. 


In 
view 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
same 
electrical 
bodies 
exert 
at 
different 
distances 
different 
forces 
upon 
one 
another, 
exception 
might 
be 
taken 
to 
the 
measure 
of 
quantity 
here 
developed. 
What 
kind 
of 
a 
quantity 
is 
that 
which 
now 
weighs 
more, 
and 
now 
weighs 
less, 
so 
to 
speak? 
But 
this 
apparent 
deviation 
from 
the 
method 
of 
determination 
commonly 
used 
in 
practical 
life, 
that 
by 
weight, 
is, 
closely 
considered, 
an 
agreement. 
On 
a 
high 
mountain 
a 
heavy 
mass 
also 
is 



less 
powerfully 
attracted 
to 
the 
earth 
than 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
sea, 
and 
if 
it 
is 
permitted 
us 
in 
our 
determinations 
to 
neglect 
the 
consideration 
of 
level, 
it 
is 
only 
because 
the 
comparison 
of 
a 
body 
with 
fixed 
conventional 
weights 
is 
invariably 
effected 
at 
the 
same 
level. 
In 
fact, 
if 
we 
were 
to 
make 
one 
of 
the 
two 
weights 
equilibrated 
on 
our 
balance 
approach 
sensibly 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth, 
by 
suspending 
it 
from 
a 
very 
long 
thread, 
as 
Prof. 
von 
Jolly 
of 
Munich 
suggested, 
we 
should 
make 
the 
gravity 
of 
that 
weight, 
its 
heaviness, 
proportionately 
greater. 


Let 
us 
picture 
to 
ourselves, 
now, 
two 
different 
electrical 
fluids, 
a 
positive 
and 
a 
negative 
fluid, 
of 
such 
nature 
that 
the 
particles 
of 
the 
one 
attract 
the 
particles 
of 
the 
other 
according 
to 
the 
law 
of 
the 
inverse 
squares, 
but 
the 
particles 
of 
the 
same 
fluid 
repel 
each 
other 
by 
the 
same 
law; 
in 
non-electrical 
bodies 
let 
us 
imagine 
the 
two 
fluids 
uniformly 
distributed 
in 
equal 
quantities, 
in 
electric 
bodies 
one 
of 
the 
two 
in 
excess; 
in 
conductors, 
further, 
let 
us 
imagine 
the 
fluids 
mobile, 
in 
non-conductors 
immobile; 
having 
formed 
such 
pictures, 
we 
possess 
the 
conception 
which 
Coulomb 
developed 
and 
to 
which 
he 
gave 
mathematical 
precision. 
We 
have 
only 
to 
give 
this 
conception 
free 
play 
in 
our 
minds 
and 
we 
shall 
see 
as 
in 
a 
clear 
picture 
the 
fluid 
particles, 
say 
of 
a 
positively 
charged 
conductor, 
receding 
from 
one 
another 
as 
far 
as 
they 
can, 
all 
making 
for 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
conductor 
and 
there 
seeking 
out 
the 
prominent 
parts 
and 
points 
until 
the 
greatest 
possible 
amount 
of 
work 
has 
been 
performed. 
On 
increasing 
the 
size 
of 
the 
surface, 
we 
see 
a 
dispersion, 
on 
decreasing 
its 
size 
we 
see 
a 
condensation 
of 
the 
particles. 
In 
a 
second, 
non-
electrified 
conductor 
brought 
into 
the 
vicinity 
of 
the 
first, 
we 
see 
the 
two 
fluids 
immediately 
separate, 
the 
positive 
collecting 
itself 
on 
the 
remote 
and 
the 
negative 
on 
the 
adjacent 
side 
of 
its 
surface. 
In 
the 
fact 
that 
this 
conception 
reproduces, 
lucidly 
and 
spontaneously, 
all 
the 
data 
which 
arduous 
research 
only 
slowly 
and 
gradually 
discovered, 
is 
contained 
its 
advantage 
and 
scientific 
value. 
With 
this, 
too, 
its 
value 
is 
exhausted. 
We 
must 
not 
seek 
in 
nature 
for 
the 
two 
hypothetical 
fluids 
which 
we 
have 
added 
as 
simple 
mental 
adjuncts, 
if 
we 
would 
not 
go 
astray. 
Coulomb's 
view 
may 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
totally 
different 
one, 
for 
example, 
by 
that 
of 
Faraday, 
and 
the 
most 
proper 
course 
is 
always, 
after 
the 
general 
survey 
is 
obtained, 
to 
go 
back 
to 
the 
actual 
facts, 
to 
the 
electrical 
forces. 


We 
will 
now 
make 
ourselves 
familiar 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
electrical 
quantity, 



and 
with 
the 
method 
of 
measuring 
or 
estimating 
it. 
Imagine 
a 
common 
Leyden 
jar 
(Fig. 
29), 
the 
inner 
and 
outer 
coatings 
of 
which 
are 
connected 
together 
by 
means 
of 
two 
common 
metallic 
knobs 
placed 
about 
a 
centimetre 
apart. 
If 
the 
inside 
coating 
be 
charged 
with 
the 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
+q, 
on 
the 
outer 
coating 
a 
distribution 
of 
the 
electricities 
will 
take 
place. 
A 
positive 
quantity 
almost 
equal 
[28] 
to 
the 
quantity 
+q 
flows 
off 
to 
the 
earth, 
while 
a 
corresponding 
quantity-q 
is 
still 
left 
on 
the 
outer 
coating. 
The 
knobs 
of 
the 
jar 
receive 
their 
portion 
of 
these 
quantities 
and 
when 
the 
quantity 
q 
is 
sufficiently 
great 
a 
rupture 
of 
the 
insulating 
air 
between 
the 
knobs, 
accompanied 
by 
the 
self-discharge 
of 
the 
jar, 
takes 
place. 
For 
any 
given 
distance 
and 
size 
of 
the 
knobs, 
a 
charge 
of 
a 
definite 
electric 
quantity 
q 
is 
always 
necessary 
for 
the 
spontaneous 
discharge 
of 
the 
jar. 


Let 
us 
insulate, 
now, 
the 
outer 
coating 
of 
a 
Lane's 
unit 
jar 
L, 
the 
jar 
just 
described, 
and 
put 
in 
connexion 
with 
it 
the 
inner 
coating 
of 
a 
jar 
F 
exteriorly 
connected 
with 
the 
earth 
(Fig. 
30). 
Every 
time 
that 
L 
is 
charged 
with 
+q,a 
like 
quantity 
+q 
is 
collected 
on 
the 
inner 
coating 
of 
F, 
and 
the 
spontaneous 
discharge 
of 
the 
jar 
L, 
which 
is 
now 
again 
empty, 
takes 
place. 
The 
number 
of 
the 
discharges 
of 
the 
jar 
L 
furnishes 
us, 
thus, 
with 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
quantity 
collected 
in 
the 
jar 
F, 
and 
if 
after 
1, 
2, 
3, 
... 
spontaneous 
discharges 
of 
L 
the 
jar 
F 
is 
discharged, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
charge 
of 
F 
has 
been 
proportionately 
augmented. 


Let 
us 
supply 
now, 
to 
effect 
the 
spontaneous 
discharge, 
the 
jar 
F 
with 
knobs 
of 
the 
same 
size 
and 
at 
the 
same 
distance 
apart 
as 
those 
of 
the 
jar 
L 
(Fig. 
31). 
If 
we 
find, 
then, 
that 
five 
discharges 
of 
the 
unit 
jar 
take 
place 
before 
one 
spontaneous 
discharge 
of 
the 
jar 
F 
occurs, 
plainly 
the 
jar 
F, 
for 
equal 
distances 
between 
the 
knobs 
of 
the 
two 
jars, 
equal 
striking 
distances, 
is 
able 
to 
hold 
five 
times 
the 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
that 
L 
can, 
that 
is, 
has 
five 
times 


[29] 


the 
capacity 
of 
L. 


We 
will 
now 
replace 
the 
unit 
jar 
L, 
with 
which 
we 
measure 
electricity, 
so 
to 
speak, 
into 
the 
jar 
F, 
by 
a 
Franklin's 
pane, 
consisting 
of 
two 
parallel 
flat 
metal 
plates 
(Fig. 
32), 
separated 
only 
by 
air. 
If 
here, 
for 
example, 
thirty 
spontaneous 
discharges 
of 
the 
pane 
are 
sufficient 
to 
fill 
the 
jar, 
ten 
discharges 
will 
be 
found 
sufficient 
if 
the 
air-space 
between 
the 
two 
plates 
be 
filled 
with 
a 
cake 
of 
sulphur. 
Hence, 
the 
capacity 
of 
a 
Franklin's 
pane 
of 
sulphur 
is 
about 



three 
times 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
one 
of 
the 
same 
shape 
and 
size 
made 
of 
air, 
or, 
as 
it 
is 
the 
custom 
to 
say, 
the 
specific 
inductive 
capacity 
of 
sulphur 
(that 
of 
air 
being 
taken 
as 
the 
unit) 
is 
about 
3. 
[30] 
We 
are 
here 
arrived 
at 
a 
very 
simple 
fact, 
which 
clearly 
shows 
us 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
number 
called 
dielectric 
constant, 
or 
specific 
inductive 
capacity, 
the 
knowledge 
of 
which 
is 
so 
important 
for 
the 
theory 
of 
submarine 
cables. 


Let 
us 
consider 
a 
jar 
A, 
which 
is 
charged 
with 
a 
certain 
quantity 
of 
electricity. 
We 
can 
discharge 
the 
jar 
directly. 
But 
we 
can 
also 
discharge 
the 
jar 
A 
(Fig. 


33) 
partly 
into 
a 
jar 
B, 
by 
connecting 
the 
two 
outer 
coatings 
with 
each 
other. 
In 
this 
operation 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
passes, 
accompanied 
by 
sparks, 
into 
the 
jar 
B, 
and 
we 
now 
find 
both 
jars 
charged. 
It 
may 
be 
shown 
as 
follows 
that 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
constant 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
can 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
a 
pure 
fact. 
Picture 
to 
yourself 
any 
sort 
of 
electrical 
conductor 
(Fig. 
34); 
cut 
it 
up 
into 
a 
large 
number 
of 
small 
pieces, 
and 
place 
these 
pieces 
by 
means 
of 
an 
insulated 
rod 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
one 
centimetre 
from 
an 
electrical 
body 
which 
acts 
with 
unit 
of 
force 
on 
an 
equal 
and 
like-constituted 
body 
at 
the 
same 
distance. 
Take 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
forces 
which 
this 
last 
body 
exerts 
on 
the 
single 
pieces 
of 
the 
conductor. 
The 
sum 
of 
these 
forces 
will 
be 
the 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
on 
the 
whole 
conductor. 
It 
remains 
the 
same, 
whether 
we 
change 
the 
form 
and 
the 
size 
of 
the 
conductor, 
or 
whether 
we 
bring 
it 
near 
or 
move 
it 
away 
from 
a 
second 
electrical 
conductor, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
keep 
it 
insulated, 
that 
is, 
do 
not 
discharge 
it. 


A 
basis 
of 
reality 
for 
the 
notion 
of 
electric 
quantity 
seems 
also 
to 
present 
itself 
from 
another 
quarter. 
If 
a 
current, 
that 
is, 
in 
the 
usual 
view, 
a 
definite 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
per 
second, 
is 
sent 
through 
a 
column 
of 
acidulated 
water; 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
positive 
stream, 
hydrogen, 
but 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
oxygen 
is 
liberated 
at 
the 
extremities 
of 
the 
column. 
For 
a 
given 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
a 
given 
quantity 
of 
oxygen 
appears. 
You 
may 
picture 
the 
column 
of 
water 
as 
a 
column 
of 
hydrogen 
and 
a 
column 
of 
oxygen, 
fitted 
into 
each 
other, 
and 
may 
say 
the 
electric 
current 
is 
a 
chemical 
current 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Although 
this 
notion 
is 
more 
difficult 
to 
adhere 
to 
in 
the 
field 
of 
statical 
electricity 
and 
with 
non-decomposable 
conductors, 
its 
further 
development 
is 
by 
no 
means 
hopeless. 



The 
concept 
quantity 
of 
electricity, 
thus, 
is 
not 
so 
aerial 
as 
might 
appear, 
but 
is 
able 
to 
conduct 
us 
with 
certainty 
through 
a 
multitude 
of 
varied 
phenomena, 
and 
is 
suggested 
to 
us 
by 
the 
facts 
in 
almost 
palpable 
form. 
We 
can 
collect 
electrical 
force 
in 
a 
body, 
measure 
it 
out 
with 
one 
body 
into 
another, 
carry 
it 
over 
from 
one 
body 
into 
another, 
just 
as 
we 
can 
collect 
a 
liquid 
in 
a 
vessel, 
measure 
it 
out 
with 
one 
vessel 
into 
another, 
or 
pour 
it 
from 
one 
into 
another. 


For 
the 
analysis 
of 
mechanical 
phenomena, 
a 
metrical 
notion, 
derived 
from 
experience, 
and 
bearing 
the 
designation 
work, 
has 
proved 
itself 
useful. 
A 
machine 
can 
be 
set 
in 
motion 
only 
when 
the 
forces 
acting 
on 
it 
can 
perform 
work. 


Let 
us 
consider, 
for 
example, 
a 
wheel 
and 
axle 
(Fig. 
35) 
having 
the 
radii 
1 
and 
2 
metres, 
loaded 
respectively 
with 
the 
weights 
2 
and 
1 
kilogrammes. 
On 
turning 
the 
wheel 
and 
axle, 
the 
1 
kilogramme-weight, 
let 
us 
say, 
sinks 
two 
metres, 
while 
the 
2 
kilogramme-weight 
rises 
one 
metre. 
On 
both 
sides 
the 
product 


KGR. 
M. 
KGR. 
M. 


1 
× 
2 
= 
2 
× 
1. 


is 
equal. 
So 
long 
as 
this 
is 
so, 
the 
wheel 
and 
axle 
will 
not 
move 
of 
itself. 
But 
if 
we 
take 
such 
loads, 
or 
so 
change 
the 
radii 
of 
the 
wheels, 
that 
this 
product 
(kgr. 
× 
metre) 
on 
displacement 
is 
in 
excess 
on 
one 
side, 
that 
side 
will 
sink. 
As 
we 
see, 
this 
product 
is 
characteristic 
for 
mechanical 
events, 
and 
for 
this 
reason 
has 
been 
invested 
with 
a 
special 
name, 
work. 


In 
all 
mechanical 
processes, 
and 
as 
all 
physical 
processes 
present 
a 
mechanical 
side, 
in 
all 
physical 
processes, 
work 
plays 
a 
determinative 
part. 
Electrical 
forces, 
also, 
produce 
only 
changes 
in 
which 
work 
is 
performed. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
forces 
come 
into 
play 
in 
electrical 
phenomena, 
electrical 
phenomena, 
be 
they 
what 
they 
may, 
extend 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
mechanics 
and 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
laws 
which 
hold 
in 
this 
domain. 
The 
universally 
adopted 
measure 
of 
work, 
now, 
is 
the 
product 
of 
the 
force 
into 
the 
distance 
through 
which 
it 
acts, 
and 
in 
the 
C. 
G. 
S. 
system, 
the 
unit 
of 
work 
is 
the 
action 
through 
one 
centimetre 
of 
a 
force 
which 
would 
impart 
in 
one 
second 
to 
a 
gramme-mass 
a 
velocity-increment 
of 
one 
centimetre, 
that 
is, 
in 
round 



numbers, 
the 
action 
through 
a 
centimetre 
of 
a 
pressure 
equal 
to 
the 
weight 
of 
a 
milligramme. 
From 
a 
positively 
charged 
body, 
electricity, 
yielding 
to 
the 
force 
of 
repulsion 
and 
performing 
work, 
flows 
off 
to 
the 
earth, 
providing 
conducting 
connexions 
exist. 
To 
a 
negatively 
charged 
body, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
earth 
under 
the 
same 
circumstances 
gives 
off 
positive 
electricity. 
The 
electrical 
work 
possible 
in 
the 
interaction 
of 
a 
body 
with 
the 
earth, 
characterises 
the 
electrical 
condition 
of 
that 
body. 
We 
will 
call 
the 
work 
which 
must 
be 
expended 
on 
the 
unit 
quantity 
of 
positive 
electricity 
to 
raise 
it 


[31] 


from 
the 
earth 
to 
the 
body 
K 
the 
potential 
of 
the 
body 
K. 


We 
ascribe 
to 
the 
body 
K 
in 
the 
C. 
G. 
S. 
system 
the 
potential 
+1, 
if 
we 
must 
expend 
the 
unit 
of 
work 
to 
raise 
the 
positive 
electrostatic 
unit 
of 
electric 
quantity 
from 
the 
earth 
to 
that 
body; 
the 
potential 
-1, 
if 
we 
gain 
in 
this 
procedure 
the 
unit 
of 
work; 
the 
potential 
0, 
if 
no 
work 
at 
all 
is 
performed 
in 
the 
operation. 


The 
different 
parts 
of 
one 
and 
the 
same 
electrical 
conductor 
in 
electrical 
equilibrium 
have 
the 
same 
potential, 
for 
otherwise 
the 
electricity 
would 
perform 
work 
and 
move 
about 
upon 
the 
conductor, 
and 
equilibrium 
would 
not 
have 
existed. 
Different 
conductors 
of 
equal 
potential, 
put 
in 
connexion 
with 
one 
another, 
do 
not 
exchange 
electricity 
any 
more 
than 
bodies 
of 
equal 
temperature 
in 
contact 
exchange 
heat, 
or 
in 
connected 
vessels, 
in 
which 
the 
same 
pressures 
exist, 
liquids 
flow 
from 
one 
vessel 
to 
the 
other. 
Exchange 
of 
electricity 
takes 
place 
only 
between 
conductors 
of 
different 
potentials, 
but 
in 
conductors 
of 
given 
form 
and 
position 
a 
definite 
difference 
of 
potential 
is 
necessary 
for 
a 
spark, 
which 
pierces 
the 
insulating 
air, 
to 
pass 
between 
them. 


On 
being 
connected, 
every 
two 
conductors 
assume 
at 
once 
the 
same 
potential. 
With 
this 
the 
means 
is 
given 
of 
determining 
the 
potential 
of 
a 
conductor 
through 
the 
agency 
of 
a 
second 
conductor 
expressly 
adapted 
to 
the 
purpose 
called 
an 
electrometer, 
just 
as 
we 
determine 
the 
temperature 
of 
a 
body 
with 
a 
thermometer. 
The 
values 
of 
the 
potentials 
of 
bodies 
obtained 
in 
this 
way 
simplify 
vastly 
our 
analysis 
of 
their 
electrical 
behavior, 
as 
will 
be 
evident 
from 
what 
has 
been 
said. 


Think 
of 
a 
positively 
charged 
conductor. 
Double 
all 
the 
electrical 
forces 
exerted 
by 
this 
conductor 
on 
a 
point 
charged 
with 
unit 
quantity, 
that 
is, 
double 
the 
quantity 
at 
each 
point, 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing, 
double 
the 
total 



charge. 
Plainly, 
equilibrium 
still 
subsists. 
But 
carry, 
now, 
the 
positive 
electrostatic 
unit 
towards 
the 
conductor. 
Everywhere 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
overcome 
double 
the 
force 
of 
repulsion 
we 
did 
before, 
everywhere 
we 
shall 
have 
to 
expend 
double 
the 
work. 
By 
doubling 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
conductor 
a 
double 
potential 
has 
been 
produced. 
Charge 
and 
potential 
go 
hand 
in 
hand, 
are 
proportional. 
Consequently, 
calling 
the 
total 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
of 
a 
conductor 
Q 
and 
its 
potential 
V, 
we 
can 
write: 
Q 
= 
CV, 
where 
C 
stands 
for 
a 
constant, 
the 
import 
of 
which 
will 
be 
understood 
simply 
from 
noting 
that 
C 
= 
Q/V. 
[32] 
But 
the 
division 
of 
a 
number 
representing 
the 
units 
of 
quantity 
of 
a 
conductor 
by 
the 
number 
representing 
its 
units 
of 
potential 
tells 
us 
the 
quantity 
which 
falls 
to 
the 
share 
of 
the 
unit 
of 
potential. 
Now 
the 
number 
C 
here 
we 
call 
the 
capacity 
of 
a 
conductor, 
and 
have 
substituted, 
thus, 
in 
the 
place 
of 
the 
old 
relative 
determination 
of 
capacity, 
an 
absolute 
determination. 


[33] 


In 
simple 
cases 
the 
connexion 
between 
charge, 
potential, 
and 
capacity 
is 
easily 
ascertained. 
Our 
conductor, 
let 
us 
say, 
is 
a 
sphere 
of 
radius 
r, 
suspended 
free 
in 
a 
large 
body 
of 
air. 
There 
being 
no 
other 
conductors 
in 
the 
vicinity, 
the 
charge 
q 
will 
then 
distribute 
itself 
uniformly 
upon 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
sphere, 
and 
simple 
geometrical 
considerations 
yield 
for 
its 
potential 
the 
expression 
V 
= 
q/r. 
Hence, 
q/V 
= 
r; 
that 
is, 
the 
capacity 
of 
a 
sphere 
is 
measured 
by 
its 
radius, 
and 
in 
the 
C. 
G. 
S. 
system 
in 
centimetres. 
[34] 
It 
is 
clear 
also, 
since 
a 
potential 
is 
a 
quantity 
divided 
by 
a 
length, 
that 
a 
quantity 
divided 
by 
a 
potential 
must 
be 
a 
length. 


Imagine 
(Fig. 
36) 
a 
jar 
composed 
of 
two 
concentric 
conductive 
spherical 
shells 
of 
the 
radii 
r 
and 
r 
1, 
having 
only 
air 
between 
them. 
Connecting 
the 
outside 
sphere 
with 
the 
earth, 
and 
charging 
the 
inside 
sphere 
by 
means 
of 
a 
thin, 
insulated 
wire 
passing 
through 
the 
first, 
with 
the 
quantity 
Q, 
we 
shall 
have 
V 
=(r 
1-r)/(r 
1 
r)Q, 
and 
for 
the 
capacity 
in 
this 
case 
(r 
1 
r)/(r 
1-r), 
or, 
to 


take 
a 
specific 
example, 
if 
r 
= 
16 
and 
r 
1 
= 
19, 
a 
capacity 
of 
about 
100 
centimetres. 


We 
shall 
now 
use 
these 
simple 
cases 
for 
illustrating 
the 
principle 
by 
which 
capacity 
and 
potential 
are 
determined. 
First, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
can 
use 
the 
jar 
composed 
of 
concentric 
spheres 
with 
its 
known 
capacity 
as 
our 
unit 
jar 
and 
by 
means 
of 
this 
ascertain, 
in 
the 
manner 
above 
laid 
down, 
the 
capacity 
of 



any 
given 
jar 
F. 
We 
find, 
for 
example, 
that 
37 
discharges 
of 
this 
unit 
jar 
of 
the 
capacity 
100, 
just 
charges 
the 
jar 
investigated 
at 
the 
same 
striking 
distance, 
that 
is, 
at 
the 
same 
potential. 
Hence, 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
jar 
investigated 
is 
3700 
centimetres. 
The 
large 
battery 
of 
the 
Prague 
physical 
laboratory, 
which 
consists 
of 
sixteen 
such 
jars, 
all 
of 
nearly 
equal 
size, 
has 
a 
capacity, 
therefore, 
of 
something 
like 
50,000 
centimetres, 
or 
the 
capacity 
of 
a 
sphere, 
a 
kilometre 
in 
diameter, 
freely 
suspended 
in 
atmospheric 
space. 
This 
remark 
distinctly 
shows 
us 
the 
great 
superiority 
which 
Leyden 
jars 
possess 
for 
the 
storage 
of 
electricity 
as 
compared 
with 
common 
conductors. 
In 
fact, 
as 
Faraday 
pointed 
out, 
jars 
differ 
from 
simple 
conductors 
mainly 
by 
their 
great 
capacity. 


For 
determining 
potential, 
imagine 
the 
inner 
coating 
of 
a 
jar 
F, 
the 
outer 
coating 
of 
which 
communicates 
with 
the 
ground, 
connected 
by 
a 
long, 
thin 
wire 
with 
a 
conductive 
sphere 
K 
placed 
free 
in 
a 
large 
atmospheric 
space, 
compared 
with 
whose 
dimensions 
the 
radius 
of 
the 
sphere 
vanishes. 
(Fig. 
37.) 
The 
jar 
and 
the 
sphere 
assume 
at 
once 
the 
same 
potential. 
But 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
sphere, 
if 
that 
be 
sufficiently 
far 
removed 
from 
all 
other 
conductors, 
a 
uniform 
layer 
of 
electricity 
will 
be 
found. 
If 
the 
sphere, 
having 
the 
radius 
r, 
contains 
the 
charge 
q, 
its 
potential 
is 
V 
= 
q/r. 
If 
the 
upper 
half 
of 
the 
sphere 
be 
severed 
from 
the 
lower 
half 
and 
equilibrated 
on 
a 
balance 
with 
one 
of 
whose 
beams 
it 
is 
connected 
by 
silk 
threads, 
the 
upper 
half 
will 
be 
repelled 
from 
the 
lower 
half 
with 
the 
force 
P 
= 
q 
2/8r 
2 
= 
1/8V 
2. 
This 
repulsion 
P 
may 
be 
counter-balanced 
by 
additional 
weights 
placed 
on 
the 
beam-end, 
and 
so 
ascertained. 
The 
potential 
is 
then 
V 
= 
√(8P). 
[35] 


That 
the 
potential 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
force 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
see. 
A 
doubling 
or 
trebling 
of 
the 
potential 
means 
that 
the 
charge 
of 
all 
the 
parts 
is 
doubled 
or 
trebled; 
hence 
their 
combined 
power 
of 
repulsion 
quadrupled 
or 
nonupled. 


Let 
us 
consider 
a 
special 
case. 
I 
wish 
to 
produce 
the 
potential 
40 
on 
the 
sphere. 
What 
additional 
weight 
must 
I 
give 
to 
the 
half 
sphere 
in 
grammes 
that 
the 
force 
of 
repulsion 
shall 
maintain 
the 
balance 
in 
exact 
equilibrium? 
As 
a 
gramme 
weight 
is 
approximately 
equivalent 
to 
1000 
units 
of 
force, 
we 
have 
only 
the 
following 
simple 
example 
to 
work 
out: 
40×40 
= 
8× 
1000.x, 
where 
x 
stands 
for 
the 
number 
of 
grammes. 
In 
round 
numbers 
we 
get 
x 
= 
0.2 
gramme. 



I 
charge 
the 
jar. 
The 
balance 
is 
deflected; 
I 
have 
reached, 
or 
rather 
passed, 
the 
potential 
40, 
and 
you 
see 
when 
I 
discharge 
the 
jar 
the 
associated 
spark. 
[36] 


The 
striking 
distance 
between 
the 
knobs 
of 
a 
machine 
increases 
with 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
potential, 
although 
not 
proportionately 
to 
that 
difference. 
The 
striking 
distance 
increases 
faster 
than 
the 
potential 
difference. 
For 
a 
distance 
between 
the 
knobs 
of 
one 
centimetre 
on 
this 
machine 
the 
difference 
of 
potential 
is 
110. 
It 
can 
easily 
be 
increased 
tenfold. 
Of 
the 
tremendous 
differences 
of 
potential 
which 
occur 
in 
nature 
some 
idea 
may 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
striking 
distances 
of 
lightning 
in 
thunder-storms 
is 
counted 
by 
miles. 
The 
differences 
of 
potential 
in 
galvanic 
batteries 
are 
considerably 
smaller 
than 
those 
of 
our 
machine, 
for 
it 
takes 
fully 
one 
hundred 
elements 
to 
give 
a 
spark 
of 
microscopic 
striking 
distance. 


We 
shall 
now 
employ 
the 
ideas 
reached 
to 
shed 
some 
light 
upon 
another 
important 
relation 
between 
electrical 
and 
mechanical 
phenomena. 
We 
shall 
investigate 
what 
is 
the 
potential 
energy, 
or 
the 
store 
of 
work, 
contained 
in 
a 
charged 
conductor, 
for 
example, 
in 
a 
jar. 


If 
we 
bring 
a 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
up 
to 
a 
conductor, 
or, 
to 
speak 
less 
pictorially, 
if 
we 
generate 
by 
work 
electrical 
force 
in 
a 
conductor, 
this 
force 
is 
able 
to 
produce 
anew 
the 
work 
by 
which 
it 
was 
generated. 
How 
great, 
now, 
is 
the 
energy 
or 
capacity 
for 
work 
of 
a 
conductor 
of 
known 
charge 
Q 
and 
known 
potential 
V? 


Imagine 
the 
given 
charge 
Q 
divided 
into 
very 
small 
parts 
q, 
q 
1, 
q 
2 
..., 
and 
these 
little 
parts 
successively 
carried 
up 
to 
the 
conductor. 
The 
first 
very 
small 
quantity 
q 
is 
brought 
up 
without 
any 
appreciable 
work 
and 
produces 
by 
its 
presence 
a 
small 
potential 
V 
. 
To 
bring 
up 
the 
second 
quantity, 
accordingly, 


' 
we 
must 
do 
the 
work 
qV 
, 
and 
similarly 
for 
the 
quantities 
which 
follow 
the 


'' 
work 
qV 
, 
qV 
, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Now, 
as 
the 
potential 
rises 
proportionately 


'' 
'' 
''' 
''' 
to 
the 
quantities 
added 
until 
the 
value 
V 
is 
reached, 
we 
have, 
agreeably 
to 
the 
graphical 
representation 
of 
Fig. 
38, 
for 
the 
total 
work 
performed, 


W 
= 
1/2QV, 



which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
total 
energy 
of 
the 
charged 
conductor. 
Using 
the 
equation 
Q 
= 
CV, 
where 
C 
stands 
for 
capacity, 
we 
also 
have, 


W 
= 
1/2CV 
2, 
or 
W 
= 
Q 
2/2C. 


It 
will 
be 
helpful, 
perhaps, 
to 
elucidate 
this 
idea 
by 
an 
analogy 
from 
the 
province 
of 
mechanics. 
If 
we 
pump 
a 
quantity 
of 
liquid, 
Q, 
gradually 
into 
a 
cylindrical 
vessel 
(Fig. 
39), 
the 
level 
of 
the 
liquid 
in 
the 
vessel 
will 
gradually 
rise. 
The 
more 
we 
have 
pumped 
in, 
the 
greater 
the 
pressure 
we 
must 
overcome, 
or 
the 
higher 
the 
level 
to 
which 
we 
must 
lift 
the 
liquid. 
The 
stored-
up 
work 
is 
rendered 
again 
available 
when 
the 
heavy 
liquid 
Q, 
which 
reaches 
up 
to 
the 
level 
h, 
flows 
out. 
This 
work 
W 
corresponds 
to 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
whole 
liquid 
weight 
Q, 
through 
the 
distance 
h/2 
or 
through 
the 
altitude 
of 
its 
centre 
of 
gravity. 
We 
have 


W 
= 
1/2Qh. 


Further, 
since 
Q 
= 
Kh, 
or 
since 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
liquid 
and 
the 
height 
h 
are 
proportional, 
we 
get 
also 


W 
= 
1/2Kh 
2 
and 
W 
= 
Q 
2/2K. 


As 
a 
special 
case 
let 
us 
consider 
our 
jar. 
Its 
capacity 
is 
C 
= 
3700, 
its 
potential 
V 
= 
110; 
accordingly, 
its 
quantity 
Q 
= 
CV 
= 
407,000 
electrostatic 
units 
and 
its 
energy 
W 
= 
1/2QV 
= 
22,385,000 
C. 
G. 
S. 
units 
of 
work. 


The 
unit 
of 
work 
of 
the 
C. 
G. 
S. 
system 
is 
not 
readily 
appreciable 
by 
the 
senses, 
nor 
does 
it 
well 
admit 
of 
representation, 
as 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to 
work 
with 
weights. 
Let 
us 
adopt, 
therefore, 
as 
our 
unit 
of 
work 
the 
grammecentimetre, 
or 
the 
gravitational 
pressure 
of 
a 
gramme-weight 
through 
the 
distance 
of 
a 
centimetre, 
which 
in 
round 
numbers 
is 
1000 
times 
greater 
than 
the 
unit 
assumed 
above; 
in 
this 
case, 
our 
numerical 
result 
will 
be 
approximately 
1000 
times 
smaller. 
Again, 
if 
we 
pass, 
as 
more 
familiar 
in 
practice, 
to 
the 
kilogramme-metre 
as 
our 
unit 
of 
work, 
our 
unit, 
the 
distance 
being 
increased 
a 
hundred 
fold, 
and 
the 
weight 
a 
thousand 
fold, 
will 
be 
100,000 
times 
larger. 
The 
numerical 
result 
expressing 
the 
work 
done 
is 
in 
this 
case 
100,000 
times 
less, 
being 
in 
round 
numbers 
0.22 
kilogramme-metre. 
We 
can 
obtain 
a 
clear 
idea 
of 
the 
work 
done 
here 
by 
letting 
a 
kilogramme-weight 



fall 
22 
centimetres. 


This 
amount 
of 
work, 
accordingly, 
is 
performed 
on 
the 
charging 
of 
the 
jar, 
and 
on 
its 
discharge 
appears 
again, 
according 
to 
the 
circumstances, 
partly 
as 
sound, 
partly 
as 
a 
mechanical 
disruption 
of 
insulators, 
partly 
as 
light 
and 
heat, 
and 
so 
forth. 


The 
large 
battery 
of 
the 
Prague 
physical 
laboratory, 
with 
its 
sixteen 
jars 
charged 
to 
equal 
potentials, 
furnishes, 
although 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
discharge 
is 
imposing, 
a 
total 
amount 
of 
work 
of 
only 
three 
kilogramme-metres. 


In 
the 
development 
of 
the 
ideas 
above 
laid 
down 
we 
are 
not 
restricted 
to 
the 
method 
there 
pursued; 
in 
fact, 
that 
method 
was 
selected 
only 
as 
one 
especially 
fitted 
to 
familiarise 
us 
with 
the 
phenomena. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
connexion 
of 
the 
physical 
processes 
is 
so 
multifarious 
that 
we 
can 
come 
at 
the 
same 
event 
from 
very 
different 
directions. 
Particularly 
are 
electrical 
phenomena 
connected 
with 
all 
other 
physical 
events; 
and 
so 
intimate 
is 
this 
connexion 
that 
we 
might 
justly 
call 
the 
study 
of 
electricity 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
general 
connexion 
of 
physical 
processes. 


With 
respect 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy 
which 
unites 
electrical 
with 
mechanical 
phenomena, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
point 
out 
briefly 
two 
ways 
of 
following 
up 
the 
study 
of 
this 
connexion. 


A 
few 
years 
ago 
Professor 
Rosetti, 
taking 
an 
influence-machine, 
which 
he 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
means 
of 
weights 
alternately 
in 
the 
electrical 
and 
non-electrical 
condition 
with 
the 
same 
velocities, 
determined 
the 
mechanical 
work 
expended 
in 
the 
two 
cases 
and 
was 
thus 
enabled, 
after 
deducting 
the 
work 
of 
friction, 
to 
ascertain 
the 
mechanical 
work 
consumed 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
electricity. 


I 
myself 
have 
made 
this 
experiment 
in 
a 
modified, 
and, 
as 
I 
think, 
more 
advantageous 
form. 
Instead 
of 
determining 
the 
work 
of 
friction 
by 
special 
trial, 
I 
arranged 
my 
apparatus 
so 
that 
it 
was 
eliminated 
of 
itself 
in 
the 
measurement 
and 
could 
consequently 
be 
neglected. 
The 
so-called 
fixed 
disk 
of 
the 
machine, 
the 
axis 
of 
which 
is 
placed 
vertically, 
is 
suspended 
somewhat 
like 
a 
chandelier 
by 
three 
vertical 
threads 
of 
equal 
lengths 
l 
at 
a 
distance 
r 
from 
the 
axis. 
Only 
when 
the 
machine 
is 
excited 
does 
this 
fixed 
disk, 
which 



represents 
a 
Prony's 
brake, 
receive, 
through 
its 
reciprocal 
action 
with 
the 
rotating 
disk, 
a 
deflexion 
α 
and 
a 
moment 
of 
torsion 
which 
is 
expressed 
by 
D 
= 
(Pr2/l)α, 
where 
P 
is 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
disk. 
[37] 
The 
angle 
α 
is 
determined 
by 
a 
mirror 
set 
in 
the 
disk. 
The 
work 
expended 
in 
n 
rotations 
is 
given 
by 
2nπD. 


If 
we 
close 
the 
machine, 
as 
Rosetti 
did, 
we 
obtain 
a 
continuous 
current 
which 
has 
all 
the 
properties 
of 
a 
very 
weak 
galvanic 
current; 
for 
example, 
it 
produces 
a 
deflexion 
in 
a 
multiplier 
which 
we 
interpose, 
and 
so 
forth. 
We 
can 
directly 
ascertain, 
now, 
the 
mechanical 
work 
expended 
in 
the 
maintenance 
of 
this 
current. 


If 
we 
charge 
a 
jar 
by 
means 
of 
a 
machine, 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
jar 
employed 
in 
the 
production 
of 
sparks, 
in 
the 
disruption 
of 
the 
insulators, 
etc., 
corresponds 
to 
a 
part 
only 
of 
the 
mechanical 
work 
expended, 
a 
second 
part 
of 
it 
being 
consumed 
in 
the 
arc 
which 
forms 
the 
circuit. 
[38] 
This 
machine, 
with 
the 
interposed 
jar, 
affords 
in 
miniature 
a 
picture 
of 
the 
transference 
of 
force, 
or 
more 
properly 
of 
work. 
And 
in 
fact 
nearly 
the 
same 
laws 
hold 
here 
for 
the 
economical 
coefficient 
as 
obtain 
for 
large 
dynamo-machines. 


Another 
means 
of 
investigating 
electrical 
energy 
is 
by 
its 
transformation 
into 
heat. 
A 
long 
time 
ago 
(1838), 
before 
the 
mechanical 
theory 
of 
heat 
had 
attained 
its 
present 
popularity, 
Riess 
performed 
experiments 
in 
this 
field 
with 
the 
help 
of 
his 
electrical 
air-thermometer 
or 
thermo-electrometer. 


If 
the 
discharge 
be 
conducted 
through 
a 
fine 
wire 
passing 
through 
the 
globe 
of 
the 
air-thermometer, 
a 
development 
of 
heat 
is 
observed 
proportional 
to 
the 
expression 
above-discussed 
W 
= 
1/2QV. 
Although 
the 
total 
energy 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
transformed 
into 
measurable 
heat 
by 
this 
means, 
in 
as 
much 
as 
a 
portion 
is 
left 
behind 
in 
the 
spark 
in 
the 
air 
outside 
the 
thermometer, 
still 
everything 
tends 
to 
show 
that 
the 
total 
heat 
developed 
in 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
conductor 
and 
along 
all 
the 
paths 
of 
discharge 
is 
the 
equivalent 
of 
the 
work 
1/2QV. 


It 
is 
not 
important 
here 
whether 
the 
electrical 
energy 
is 
transformed 
all 
at 
once 
or 
partly, 
by 
degrees. 
For 
example, 
if 
of 
two 
equal 
jars 
one 
is 
charged 
with 
the 
quantity 
Q 
at 
the 
potential 
V 
the 
energy 
present 
is 
1/2QV. 
If 
the 
first 
jar 
be 
discharged 
into 
the 
second, 
V, 
since 
the 
capacity 
is 
now 
doubled, 
falls 
to 
V/2. 
Accordingly, 
the 
energy 
1/4QV 
remains, 
while 
1/4QV 
is 
transformed 



in 
the 
spark 
of 
discharge 
into 
heat. 
The 
remainder, 
however, 
is 
equally 
distributed 
between 
the 
two 
jars 
so 
that 
each 
on 
discharge 
is 
still 
able 
to 
transform 
1/8QV 
into 
heat. 


We 
have 
here 
discussed 
electricity 
in 
the 
limited 
phenomenal 
form 
in 
which 
it 
was 
known 
to 
the 
inquirers 
before 
Volta, 
and 
which 
has 
been 
called, 
perhaps 
not 
very 
felicitously, 
"statical 
electricity." 
It 
is 
evident, 
however, 
that 
the 
nature 
of 
electricity 
is 
everywhere 
one 
and 
the 
same; 
that 
a 
substantial 
difference 
between 
statical 
and 
galvanic 
electricity 
does 
not 
exist. 
Only 
the 
quantitative 
circumstances 
in 
the 
two 
provinces 
are 
so 
widely 
different 
that 
totally 
new 
aspects 
of 
phenomena 
may 
appear 
in 
the 
second, 
for 
example, 
magnetic 
effects, 
which 
in 
the 
first 
remained 
unnoticed, 
whilst, 
vice 
versa, 
in 
the 
second 
field 
statical 
attractions 
and 
repulsions 
are 
scarcely 
appreciable. 
As 
a 
fact, 
we 
can 
easily 
show 
the 
magnetic 
effect 
of 
the 
current 
of 
discharge 
of 
an 
influence-machine 
on 
the 
galvanoscope 
although 
we 
could 
hardly 
have 
made 
the 
original 
discovery 
of 
the 
magnetic 
effects 
with 
this 
current. 
The 
statical 
distant 
action 
of 
the 
wire 
poles 
of 
a 
galvanic 
element 
also 
would 
hardly 
have 
been 
noticed 
had 
not 
the 
phenomenon 
been 
known 
from 
a 
different 
quarter 
in 
a 
striking 
form. 


If 
we 
wished 
to 
characterise 
the 
two 
fields 
in 
their 
chief 
and 
most 
general 
features, 
we 
should 
say 
that 
in 
the 
first, 
high 
potentials 
and 
small 
quantities 
come 
into 
play, 
in 
the 
second 
small 
potentials 
and 
large 
quantities. 
A 
jar 
which 
is 
discharging 
and 
a 
galvanic 
element 
deport 
themselves 
somewhat 
like 
an 
air-gun 
and 
the 
bellows 
of 
an 
organ. 
The 
first 
gives 
forth 
suddenly 
under 
a 
very 
high 
pressure 
a 
small 
quantity 
of 
air; 
the 
latter 
liberates 
gradually 
under 
a 
very 
slight 
pressure 
a 
large 
quantity 
of 
air. 


In 
point 
of 
principle, 
too, 
nothing 
prevents 
our 
retaining 
the 
electrostatical 
units 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
galvanic 
electricity 
and 
in 
measuring, 
for 
example, 
the 
strength 
of 
a 
current 
by 
the 
number 
of 
electrostatic 
units 
which 
flow 
per 
second 
through 
its 
cross-section. 
But 
this 
would 
be 
in 
a 
double 
aspect 
impractical. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
we 
should 
totally 
neglect 
the 
magnetic 
facilities 
for 
measurement 
so 
conveniently 
offered 
by 
the 
current, 
and 
substitute 
for 
this 
easy 
means 
a 
method 
which 
can 
be 
applied 
only 
with 
difficulty 
and 
is 
not 
capable 
of 
great 
exactness. 
In 
the 
second 
place 
our 
units 
would 
be 
much 
too 



small, 
and 
we 
should 
find 
ourselves 
in 
the 
predicament 
of 
the 
astronomer 
who 
attempted 
to 
measure 
celestial 
distances 
in 
metres 
instead 
of 
in 
radii 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
the 
earth's 
orbit; 
for 
the 
current 
which 
by 
the 
magnetic 
C. 
G. 
S. 
standard 
represents 
the 
unit, 
would 
require 
a 
flow 
of 
some 
30,000,000,000 
electrostatic 
units 
per 
second 
through 
its 
cross-section. 
Accordingly, 
different 
units 
must 
be 
adopted 
here. 
The 
development 
of 
this 
point, 
however, 
lies 
beyond 
my 
present 
task. 



ON 
THE 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
THE 
CONSERVATION 
OF 
ENERGY. 
[39] 


In 
a 
popular 
lecture, 
distinguished 
for 
its 
charming 
simplicity 
and 
clearness, 
which 
Joule 
delivered 
in 
the 
year 
1847, 
[40] 
that 
famous 
physicist 
declares 
that 
the 
living 
force 
which 
a 
heavy 
body 
has 
acquired 
by 
its 
descent 
through 
a 
certain 
height 
and 
which 
it 
carries 
with 
it 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
velocity 
with 
which 
it 
is 
impressed, 
is 
the 
equivalent 
of 
the 
attraction 
of 
gravity 
through 
the 
space 
fallen 
through, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
"absurd" 
to 
assume 
that 
this 
living 
force 
could 
be 
destroyed 
without 
some 
restitution 
of 
that 
equivalent. 
He 
then 
adds: 
"You 
will 
therefore 
be 
surprised 
to 
hear 
that 
until 
very 
recently 
the 
universal 
opinion 
has 
been 
that 
living 
force 
could 
be 
absolutely 
and 
irrevocably 
destroyed 
at 
any 
one's 
option." 
Let 
us 
add 
that 
to-day, 
after 
forty-
seven 
years, 
the 
law 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy, 
wherever 
civilisation 
exists, 
is 
accepted 
as 
a 
fully 
established 
truth 
and 
receives 
the 
widest 
applications 
in 
all 
domains 
of 
natural 
science. 


The 
fate 
of 
all 
momentous 
discoveries 
is 
similar. 
On 
their 
first 
appearance 
they 
are 
regarded 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
men 
as 
errors. 
J. 
R. 
Mayer's 
work 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
energy 
(1842) 
was 
rejected 
by 
the 
first 
physical 
journal 
of 
Germany; 
Helmholtz's 
treatise 
(1847) 
met 
with 
no 
better 
success; 
and 
even 
Joule, 
to 
judge 
from 
an 
intimation 
of 
Playfair, 
seems 
to 
have 
encountered 
difficulties 
with 
his 
first 
publication 
(1843). 
Gradually, 
however, 
people 
are 
led 
to 
see 
that 
the 
new 
view 
was 
long 
prepared 
for 
and 
ready 
for 
enunciation, 
only 
that 
a 
few 
favored 
minds 
had 
perceived 
it 
much 
earlier 
than 
the 
rest, 
and 
in 
this 
way 
the 
opposition 
of 
the 
majority 
is 
overcome. 
With 
proofs 
of 
the 
fruitfulness 
of 
the 
new 
view, 
with 
its 
success, 
confidence 
in 
it 
increases. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
men 
who 
employ 
it 
cannot 
enter 
into 
a 
deep-going 
analysis 
of 
it; 
for 
them, 
its 
success 
is 
its 
proof. 
It 
can 
thus 
happen 
that 
a 
view 
which 
has 
led 
to 
the 
greatest 
discoveries, 
like 
Black's 
theory 
of 
caloric, 
in 
a 
subsequent 
period 
in 
a 
province 
where 
it 
does 
not 
apply 
may 
actually 
become 
an 
obstacle 
to 
progress 
by 
its 
blinding 
our 
eyes 
to 
facts 
which 
do 
not 
fit 
in 
with 
our 
favorite 
conceptions. 
If 
a 
theory 
is 
to 
be 
protected 
from 
this 
dubious 
rôle, 
the 
grounds 
and 
motives 
of 
its 
evolution 
and 
existence 
must 
be 
examined 
from 



time 
to 
time 
with 
the 
utmost 
care. 


The 
most 
multifarious 
physical 
changes, 
thermal, 
electrical, 
chemical, 
and 
so 
forth, 
can 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
mechanical 
work. 
When 
such 
alterations 
are 
reversed 
they 
yield 
anew 
the 
mechanical 
work 
in 
exactly 
the 
quantity 
which 
was 
required 
for 
the 
production 
of 
the 
part 
reversed. 
This 
is 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy; 
"energy" 
being 
the 
term 
which 
has 
gradually 
come 
into 
use 
for 
that 
"indestructible 
something" 
of 
which 
the 
measure 
is 
mechanical 
work. 


How 
did 
we 
acquire 
this 
idea? 
What 
are 
the 
sources 
from 
which 
we 
have 
drawn 
it? 
This 
question 
is 
not 
only 
of 
interest 
in 
itself, 
but 
also 
for 
the 
important 
reason 
above 
touched 
upon. 
The 
opinions 
which 
are 
held 
concerning 
the 
foundations 
of 
the 
law 
of 
energy 
still 
diverge 
very 
widely 
from 
one 
another. 
Many 
trace 
the 
principle 
to 
the 
impossibility 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion, 
which 
they 
regard 
either 
as 
sufficiently 
proved 
by 
experience, 
or 
as 
self-evident. 
In 
the 
province 
of 
pure 
mechanics 
the 
impossibility 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion, 
or 
the 
continuous 
production 
of 
work 
without 
some 
permanent 
alteration, 
is 
easily 
demonstrated. 
Accordingly, 
if 
we 
start 
from 
the 
theory 
that 
all 
physical 
processes 
are 
purely 
mechanical 
processes, 
motions 
of 
molecules 
and 
atoms, 
we 
embrace 
also, 
by 
this 
mechanical 
conception 
of 
physics, 
the 
impossibility 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion 
in 
the 
whole 
physical 
domain. 
At 
present 
this 
view 
probably 
counts 
the 
most 
adherents. 
Other 
inquirers, 
however, 
are 
for 
accepting 
only 
a 
purely 
experimental 
establishment 
of 
the 
law 
of 
energy. 


It 
will 
appear, 
from 
the 
discussion 
to 
follow, 
that 
all 
the 
factors 
mentioned 
have 
co-operated 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
view 
in 
question; 
but 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
them 
a 
logical 
and 
purely 
formal 
factor, 
hitherto 
little 
considered, 
has 
also 
played 
a 
very 
important 
part. 


I. 
THE 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
THE 
EXCLUDED 
PERPETUAL 
MOTION. 
The 
law 
of 
energy 
in 
its 
modern 
form 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion, 
but 
it 
is 
very 
closely 
related 
to 
it. 
The 
latter 
principle, 
however, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
new, 
for 
in 
the 
province 
of 
mechanics 
it 



has 
controlled 
for 
centuries 
the 
thoughts 
and 
investigations 
of 
the 
greatest 
thinkers. 
Let 
us 
convince 
ourselves 
of 
this 
by 
the 
study 
of 
a 
few 
historical 
examples. 


S. 
Stevinus, 
in 
his 
famous 
work 
Hypomnemata 
mathematica, 
Tom. 
IV, 
De 
statica, 
(Leyden, 
1605, 
p. 
34), 
treats 
of 
the 
equilibrium 
of 
bodies 
on 
inclined 
planes. 
Over 
a 
triangular 
prism 
ABC, 
one 
side 
of 
which, 
AC, 
is 
horizontal, 
an 
endless 
cord 
or 
chain 
is 
slung, 
to 
which 
at 
equal 
distances 
apart 
fourteen 
balls 
of 
equal 
weight 
are 
attached, 
as 
represented 
in 
cross-section 
in 
Figure 
41. 
Since 
we 
can 
imagine 
the 
lower 
symmetrical 
part 
of 
the 
cord 
ABC 
taken 
away, 
Stevinus 
concludes 
that 
the 
four 
balls 
on 
AB 
hold 
in 
equilibrium 
the 
two 
balls 
on 
BC. 
For 
if 
the 
equilibrium 
were 
for 
a 
moment 
disturbed, 
it 
could 
never 
subsist: 
the 
cord 
would 
keep 
moving 
round 
forever 
in 
the 
same 
direction,— 
we 
should 
have 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 
He 
says: 


"But 
if 
this 
took 
place, 
our 
row 
or 
ring 
of 
balls 
would 
come 
once 
more 
into 
their 
original 
position, 
and 
from 
the 
same 
cause 
the 
eight 
globes 
to 
the 
left 
would 
again 
be 
heavier 
than 
the 
six 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
therefore 
those 
eight 
would 
sink 
a 
second 
time 
and 
these 
six 
rise, 
and 
all 
the 
globes 
would 
keep 
up, 
of 
themselves, 
a 
continuous 
and 
unending 
motion, 
which 
is 
false." 
[41] 


Stevinus, 
now, 
easily 
derives 
from 
this 
principle 
the 
laws 
of 
equilibrium 
on 
the 
inclined 
plane 
and 
numerous 
other 
fruitful 
consequences. 


In 
the 
chapter 
"Hydrostatics" 
of 
the 
same 
work, 
page 
114, 
Stevinus 
sets 
up 
the 
following 
principle: 
"Aquam 
datam, 
datum 
sibi 
intra 
aquam 
locum 
servare,"—a 
given 
mass 
of 
water 
preserves 
within 
water 
its 
given 
place. 


This 
principle 
is 
demonstrated 
as 
follows 
(see 
Fig. 
42): 


"For, 
assuming 
it 
to 
be 
possible 
by 
natural 
means, 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
A 
does 
not 
preserve 
the 
place 
assigned 
to 
it, 
but 
sinks 
down 
to 
D. 
This 
being 
posited, 
the 
water 
which 
succeeds 
A 
will, 
for 
the 
same 
reason, 
also 
flow 
down 
to 
D; 
A 
will 
be 
forced 
out 
of 
its 
place 
in 
D; 
and 
thus 
this 
body 
of 
water, 
for 
the 
conditions 
in 
it 
are 
everywhere 
the 
same, 
will 
set 



up 
a 
perpetual 
motion, 
which 
is 
absurd." 
[42] 


From 
this 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
hydrostatics 
are 
deduced. 
On 
this 
occasion 
Stevinus 
also 
first 
develops 
the 
thought 
so 
fruitful 
for 
modern 
analytical 
mechanics 
that 
the 
equilibrium 
of 
a 
system 
is 
not 
destroyed 
by 
the 
addition 
of 
rigid 
connexions. 
As 
we 
know, 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
is 
now 
sometimes 
deduced 
from 
D'Alembert's 
principle 
with 
the 
help 
of 
that 
remark. 
If 
we 
were 
to 
reproduce 
Stevinus's 
demonstration 
to-day, 
we 
should 
have 
to 
change 
it 
slightly. 
We 
find 
no 
difficulty 
in 
imagining 
the 
cord 
on 
the 
prism 
possessed 
of 
unending 
uniform 
motion 
if 
all 
hindrances 
are 
thought 
away, 
but 
we 
should 
protest 
against 
the 
assumption 
of 
an 
accelerated 
motion 
or 
even 
against 
that 
of 
a 
uniform 
motion, 
if 
the 
resistances 
were 
not 
removed. 
Moreover, 
for 
greater 
precision 
of 
proof, 
the 
string 
of 
balls 
might 
be 
replaced 
by 
a 
heavy 
homogeneous 
cord 
of 
infinite 
flexibility. 
But 
all 
this 
does 
not 
affect 
in 
the 
least 
the 
historical 
value 
of 
Stevinus's 
thoughts. 
It 
is 
a 
fact, 
Stevinus 
deduces 
apparently 
much 
simpler 
truths 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
an 
impossible 
perpetual 
motion. 


In 
the 
process 
of 
thought 
which 
conducted 
Galileo 
to 
his 
discoveries 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century, 
the 
following 
principle 
plays 
an 
important 
part, 
that 
a 
body 
in 
virtue 
of 
the 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
its 
descent 
can 
rise 
exactly 
as 
high 
as 
it 
fell. 
This 
principle, 
which 
appears 
frequently 
and 
with 
much 
clearness 
in 
Galileo's 
thought, 
is 
simply 
another 
form 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
it 
is 
also 
in 
Huygens. 


Galileo, 
as 
we 
know, 
arrived 
at 
the 
law 
of 
uniformly 
accelerated 
motion 
by 
a 
priori 
considerations, 
as 
that 
law 
which 
was 
the 
"simplest 
and 
most 
natural," 
after 
having 
first 
assumed 
a 
different 
law 
which 
he 
was 
compelled 
to 
reject. 
To 
verify 
his 
law 
he 
executed 
experiments 
with 
falling 
bodies 
on 
inclined 
planes, 
measuring 
the 
times 
of 
descent 
by 
the 
weights 
of 
the 
water 
which 
flowed 
out 
of 
a 
small 
orifice 
in 
a 
large 
vessel. 
In 
this 
experiment 
he 
assumes 
as 
a 
fundamental 
principle, 
that 
the 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
descent 
down 
an 
inclined 
plane 
always 
corresponds 
to 
the 
vertical 
height 
descended 
through, 
a 
conclusion 
which 
for 
him 
is 
the 
immediate 
outcome 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
body 
which 
has 
fallen 
down 
one 
inclined 
plane 
can, 
with 
the 
velocity 
it 
has 
acquired, 
rise 
on 
another 
plane 
of 
any 
inclination 
only 
to 
the 
same 
vertical 
height. 
This 
principle 
of 
the 
height 
of 
ascent 
also 
led 
him, 
as 
it 
seems, 
to 
the 



law 
of 
inertia. 
Let 
us 
hear 
his 
own 
masterful 
words 
in 
the 
Dialogo 
terzo 
(Opere, 
Padova, 
1744, 
Tom. 
III). 
On 
page 
96 
we 
read: 


"I 
take 
it 
for 
granted 
that 
the 
velocities 
acquired 
by 
a 
body 
in 
descent 
down 
planes 
of 
different 
inclinations 
are 
equal 
if 
the 
heights 
of 
those 
planes 
are 
equal." 
[43] 


Then 
he 
makes 
Salviati 
say 
in 
the 
dialogue: 
[44] 


"What 
you 
say 
seems 
very 
probable, 
but 
I 
wish 
to 
go 
further 
and 
by 
an 
experiment 
so 
to 
increase 
the 
probability 
of 
it 
that 
it 
shall 
amount 
almost 
to 
absolute 
demonstration. 
Suppose 
this 
sheet 
of 
paper 
to 
be 
a 
vertical 
wall, 
and 
from 
a 
nail 
driven 
in 
it 
a 
ball 
of 
lead 
weighing 
two 
or 
three 
ounces 
to 
hang 
by 
a 
very 
fine 
thread 
AB 
four 
or 
five 
feet 
long. 
(Fig. 
43.) 
On 
the 
wall 
mark 
a 
horizontal 
line 
DC 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
vertical 
AB, 
which 
latter 
ought 
to 
hang 
about 
two 
inches 
from 
the 
wall. 
If 
now 
the 
thread 
AB 
with 
the 
ball 
attached 
take 
the 
position 
AC 
and 
the 
ball 
be 
let 
go, 
you 
will 
see 
the 
ball 
first 
descend 
through 
the 
arc 
CB 
and 
passing 
beyond 
B 
rise 
through 
the 
arc 
BD 
almost 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
line 
CD, 
being 
prevented 
from 
reaching 
it 
exactly 
by 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
and 
of 
the 
thread. 
From 
this 
we 
may 
truly 
conclude 
that 
its 
impetus 
at 
the 
point 
B, 
acquired 
by 
its 
descent 
through 
the 
arc 
CB, 
is 
sufficient 
to 
urge 
it 
through 
a 
similar 
arc 
BD 
to 
the 
same 
height. 
Having 
performed 
this 
experiment 
and 
repeated 
it 
several 
times, 
let 
us 
drive 
in 
the 
wall, 
in 
the 
projection 
of 
the 
vertical 
AB, 
as 
at 
E 
or 
at 
F, 
a 
nail 
five 
or 
six 
inches 
long, 
so 
that 
the 
thread 
AC, 
carrying 
as 
before 
the 
ball 
through 
the 
arc 
CB, 
at 
the 
moment 
it 
reaches 
the 
position 
AB, 
shall 
strike 
the 
nail 
E, 
and 
the 
ball 
be 
thus 
compelled 
to 
move 
up 
the 
arc 
BG 
described 
about 
E 
as 
centre. 
Then 
we 
shall 
see 
what 
the 
same 
impetus 
will 
here 
accomplish, 
acquired 
now 
as 
before 
at 
the 
same 
point 
B, 
which 
then 
drove 
the 
same 
moving 
body 
through 
the 
arc 
BD 
to 
the 
height 
of 
the 
horizontal 
CD. 
Now 
gentlemen, 
you 
will 
be 
pleased 
to 
see 
the 
ball 
rise 
to 
the 
horizontal 
line 
at 
the 
point 
G, 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
also 
happen 
if 
the 
nail 
be 
placed 
lower 
as 
at 
F, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
ball 
would 
describe 
the 
arc 
BJ, 
always 
terminating 
its 
ascent 
precisely 
at 
the 
line 
CD. 
If 
the 
nail 
be 
placed 
so 
low 
that 
the 
length 
of 
thread 
below 
it 
does 
not 
reach 
to 
the 
height 
of 
CD 
(which 
would 
happen 
if 
F 
were 
nearer 
B 
than 
to 
the 
intersection 
of 
AB 



with 
the 
horizontal 
CD), 
then 
the 
thread 
will 
wind 
itself 
about 
the 
nail. 
This 
experiment 
leaves 
no 
room 
for 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
supposition. 
For 
as 
the 
two 
arcs 
CB, 
DB 
are 
equal 
and 
similarly 
situated, 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
arc 
CB 
is 
the 
same 
as 
that 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
arc 
DB; 
but 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
at 
B 
by 
the 
descent 
through 
the 
arc 
CB 
is 
capable 
of 
driving 
up 
the 
same 
moving 
body 
through 
the 
arc 
BD; 
hence 
also 
the 
momentum 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
DB 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
which 
drives 
the 
same 
moving 
body 
through 
the 
same 
arc 
from 
B 
to 
D, 
so 
that 
in 
general 
every 
momentum 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
of 
an 
arc 
is 
equal 
to 
that 
which 
causes 
the 
same 
moving 
body 
to 
ascend 
through 
the 
same 
arc; 
but 
all 
the 
momenta 
which 
cause 
the 
ascent 
of 
all 
the 
arcs 
BD, 
BG, 
BJ, 
are 
equal 
since 
they 
are 
made 
by 
the 
same 
momentum 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
CB, 
as 
the 
experiment 
shows: 
therefore 
all 
the 
momenta 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
of 
the 
arcs 
DB, 
GB, 
JB 
are 
equal." 


The 
remark 
relative 
to 
the 
pendulum 
may 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
inclined 
plane 
and 
leads 
to 
the 
law 
of 
inertia. 
We 
read 
on 
page 
124: 
[45] 


"It 
is 
plain 
now 
that 
a 
movable 
body, 
starting 
from 
rest 
at 
A 
and 
descending 
down 
the 
inclined 
plane 
AB, 
acquires 
a 
velocity 
proportional 
to 
the 
increment 
of 
its 
time: 
the 
velocity 
possessed 
at 
B 
is 
the 
greatest 
of 
the 
velocities 
acquired, 
and 
by 
its 
nature 
immutably 
impressed, 
provided 
all 
causes 
of 
new 
acceleration 
or 
retardation 
are 
taken 
away: 
I 
say 
acceleration, 
having 
in 
view 
its 
possible 
further 
progress 
along 
the 
plane 
extended; 
retardation, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
its 
being 
reversed 
and 
made 
to 
mount 
the 
ascending 
plane 
BC. 
But 
in 
the 
horizontal 
plane 
GH 
its 
equable 
motion, 
according 
to 
its 
velocity 
as 
acquired 
in 
the 
descent 
from 
A 
to 
B, 
will 
be 
continued 
ad 
infinitum." 
(Fig. 
44.) 


Huygens, 
upon 
whose 
shoulders 
the 
mantel 
of 
Galileo 
fell, 
forms 
a 
sharper 
conception 
of 
the 
law 
of 
inertia 
and 
generalises 
the 
principle 
respecting 
the 
heights 
of 
ascent 
which 
was 
so 
fruitful 
in 
Galileo's 
hands. 
He 
employs 
the 
latter 
principle 
in 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
oscillation 
and 
is 
perfectly 
clear 
in 
the 
statement 
that 
the 
principle 
respecting 
the 
heights 
of 
ascent 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion. 


The 
following 
important 
passages 
then 
occur 
(Hugenii, 
Horologium 



oscillatorium, 
pars 
secunda). 
Hypotheses: 


"If 
gravity 
did 
not 
exist, 
nor 
the 
atmosphere 
obstruct 
the 
motions 
of 
bodies, 
a 
body 
would 
keep 
up 
forever 
the 
motion 
once 
impressed 
upon 
it, 
with 
equable 
velocity, 
in 
a 
straight 
line." 
[46] 


In 
part 
four 
of 
the 
Horologium 
de 
centro 
oscillationis 
we 
read: 


"If 
any 
number 
of 
weights 
be 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
the 
force 
of 
gravity, 
the 
common 
centre 
of 
gravity 
of 
the 
weights 
as 
a 
whole 
cannot 
possibly 
rise 
higher 
than 
the 
place 
which 
it 
occupied 
when 
the 
motion 
began. 


"That 
this 
hypothesis 
of 
ours 
may 
arouse 
no 
scruples, 
we 
will 
state 
that 
it 
simply 
imports, 
what 
no 
one 
has 
ever 
denied, 
that 
heavy 
bodies 
do 
not 
move 
upwards.—And 
truly 
if 
the 
devisers 
of 
the 
new 
machines 
who 
make 
such 
futile 
attempts 
to 
construct 
a 
perpetual 
motion 
would 
acquaint 
themselves 
with 
this 
principle, 
they 
could 
easily 
be 
brought 
to 
see 
their 
errors 
and 
to 
understand 
that 
the 
thing 
is 
utterly 
impossible 
by 
mechanical 
means." 
[47] 


There 
is 
possibly 
a 
Jesuitical 
mental 
reservation 
contained 
in 
the 
words 
"mechanical 
means." 
One 
might 
be 
led 
to 
believe 
from 
them 
that 
Huygens 
held 
a 
non-mechanical 
perpetual 
motion 
for 
possible. 


The 
generalisation 
of 
Galileo's 
principle 
is 
still 
more 
clearly 
put 
in 
Prop. 
IV 
of 
the 
same 
chapter: 


"If 
a 
pendulum, 
composed 
of 
several 
weights, 
set 
in 
motion 
from 
rest, 
complete 
any 
part 
of 
its 
full 
oscillation, 
and 
from 
that 
point 
onwards, 
the 
individual 
weights, 
with 
their 
common 
connexions 
dissolved, 
change 
their 
acquired 
velocities 
upwards 
and 
ascend 
as 
far 
as 
they 
can, 
the 
common 
centre 
of 
gravity 
of 
all 
will 
be 
carried 
up 
to 
the 
same 
altitude 
with 
that 
which 
it 
occupied 
before 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
oscillation." 
[48] 


On 
this 
last 
principle 
now, 
which 
is 
a 
generalisation, 
applied 
to 
a 
system 
of 
masses, 
of 
one 
of 
Galileo's 
ideas 
respecting 
a 
single 
mass 
and 
which 
from 
Huygens's 
explanation 
we 
recognise 
as 
the 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion, 
Huygens 
grounds 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
oscillation. 
Lagrange 



characterises 
this 
principle 
as 
precarious 
and 
is 
rejoiced 
at 
James 
Bernoulli's 
successful 
attempt, 
in 
1681, 
to 
reduce 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
oscillation 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
lever, 
which 
appeared 
to 
him 
clearer. 
All 
the 
great 
inquirers 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
and 
eighteenth 
centuries 
broke 
a 
lance 
on 
this 
problem, 
and 
it 
led 
ultimately, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
velocities, 
to 
the 
principle 
enunciated 
by 
D'Alembert 
in 
1743 
in 
his 
Traité 
de 
dynamique, 
though 
previously 
employed 
in 
a 
somewhat 
different 
form 
by 
Euler 
and 
Hermann. 


Furthermore, 
the 
Huygenian 
principle 
respecting 
the 
heights 
of 
ascent 
became 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
"law 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
living 
force," 
as 
that 
was 
enunciated 
by 
John 
and 
Daniel 
Bernoulli 
and 
employed 
with 
such 
signal 
success 
by 
the 
latter 
in 
his 
Hydrodynamics. 
The 
theorems 
of 
the 
Bernoullis 
differ 
in 
form 
only 
from 
Lagrange's 
expression 
in 
the 
Analytical 
Mechanics. 


The 
manner 
in 
which 
Torricelli 
reached 
his 
famous 
law 
of 
efflux 
for 
liquids 
leads 
again 
to 
our 
principle. 
Torricelli 
assumed 
that 
the 
liquid 
which 
flows 
out 
of 
the 
basal 
orifice 
of 
a 
vessel 
cannot 
by 
its 
velocity 
of 
efflux 
ascend 
to 
a 
greater 
height 
than 
its 
level 
in 
the 
vessel. 


Let 
us 
next 
consider 
a 
point 
which 
belongs 
to 
pure 
mechanics, 
the 
history 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
motions 
or 
virtual 
velocities. 
This 
principle 
was 
not 
first 
enunciated, 
as 
is 
usually 
stated, 
and 
as 
Lagrange 
also 
asserts, 
by 
Galileo, 
but 
earlier, 
by 
Stevinus. 
In 
his 
Trochleostatica 
of 
the 
above-cited 
work, 
page 
72, 
he 
says: 


"Observe 
that 
this 
axiom 
of 
statics 
holds 
good 
here: 


"As 
the 
space 
of 
the 
body 
acting 
is 
to 
the 
space 
of 
the 
body 
acted 
upon, 


so 
is 
the 
power 
of 
the 
body 
acted 
upon 
to 
the 
power 
of 
the 
body 
acting." 


[49] 


Galileo, 
as 
we 
know, 
recognised 
the 
truth 
of 
the 
principle 
in 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
simple 
machines, 
and 
also 
deduced 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
equilibrium 
of 
liquids 
from 
it. 


Torricelli 
carries 
the 
principle 
back 
to 
the 
properties 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity. 
The 
condition 
controlling 
equilibrium 
in 
a 
simple 
machine, 
in 
which 
power 



and 
load 
are 
represented 
by 
weights, 
is 
that 
the 
common 
centre 
of 
gravity 
of 
the 
weights 
shall 
not 
sink. 
Conversely, 
if 
the 
centre 
of 
gravity 
cannot 
sink 
equilibrium 
obtains, 
because 
heavy 
bodies 
of 
themselves 
do 
not 
move 
upwards. 
In 
this 
form 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
velocities 
is 
identical 
with 
Huygens's 
principle 
of 
the 
impossibility 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 


John 
Bernoulli, 
in 
1717, 
first 
perceived 
the 
universal 
import 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
movements 
for 
all 
systems; 
a 
discovery 
stated 
in 
a 
letter 
to 
Varignon. 
Finally, 
Lagrange 
gives 
a 
general 
demonstration 
of 
the 
principle 
and 
founds 
upon 
it 
his 
whole 
Analytical 
Mechanics. 
But 
this 
general 
demonstration 
is 
based 
after 
all 
upon 
Huygens 
and 
Torricelli's 
remarks. 
Lagrange, 
as 
is 
known, 
conceives 
simple 
pulleys 
arranged 
in 
the 
directions 
of 
the 
forces 
of 
the 
system, 
passes 
a 
cord 
through 
these 
pulleys, 
and 
appends 
to 
its 
free 
extremity 
a 
weight 
which 
is 
a 
common 
measure 
of 
all 
the 
forces 
of 
the 
system. 
With 
no 
difficulty, 
now, 
the 
number 
of 
elements 
of 
each 
pulley 
may 
be 
so 
chosen 
that 
the 
forces 
in 
question 
shall 
be 
replaced 
by 
them. 
It 
is 
then 
clear 
that 
if 
the 
weight 
at 
the 
extremity 
cannot 
sink, 
equilibrium 
subsists, 
because 
heavy 
bodies 
cannot 
of 
themselves 
move 
upwards. 
If 
we 
do 
not 
go 
so 
far, 
but 
wish 
to 
abide 
by 
Torricelli's 
idea, 
we 
may 
conceive 
every 
individual 
force 
of 
the 
system 
replaced 
by 
a 
special 
weight 
suspended 
from 
a 
cord 
passing 
over 
a 
pulley 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
force 
and 
attached 
at 
its 
point 
of 
application. 
Equilibrium 
subsists 
then 
when 
the 
common 
centre 
of 
gravity 
of 
all 
the 
weights 
together 
cannot 
sink. 
The 
fundamental 
supposition 
of 
this 
demonstration 
is 
plainly 
the 
impossibility 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 


Lagrange 
tried 
in 
every 
way 
to 
supply 
a 
proof 
free 
from 
extraneous 
elements 
and 
fully 
satisfactory, 
but 
without 
complete 
success. 
Nor 
were 
his 
successors 
more 
fortunate. 


The 
whole 
of 
mechanics, 
thus, 
is 
based 
upon 
an 
idea, 
which, 
though 
unequivocal, 
is 
yet 
unwonted 
and 
not 
coequal 
with 
the 
other 
principles 
and 
axioms 
of 
mechanics. 
Every 
student 
of 
mechanics, 
at 
some 
stage 
of 
his 
progress, 
feels 
the 
uncomfortableness 
of 
this 
state 
of 
affairs; 
every 
one 
wishes 
it 
removed; 
but 
seldom 
is 
the 
difficulty 
stated 
in 
words. 
Accordingly, 
the 
zealous 
pupil 
of 
the 
science 
is 
highly 
rejoiced 
when 
he 
reads 
in 
a 
master 
like 
Poinsot 
(Théorie 
générale 
de 
l'équilibre 
et 
du 
mouvement 
des 
systèmes) 
the 
following 
passage, 
in 
which 
that 
author 
is 
giving 
his 
opinion 
of 
the 



Analytical 
Mechanics: 


"In 
the 
meantime, 
because 
our 
attention 
in 
that 
work 
was 
first 
wholly 
engrossed 
with 
the 
consideration 
of 
its 
beautiful 
development 
of 
mechanics, 
which 
seemed 
to 
spring 
complete 
from 
a 
single 
formula, 
we 
naturally 
believed 
that 
the 
science 
was 
completed 
or 
that 
it 
only 
remained 
to 
seek 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
velocities. 
But 
that 
quest 
brought 
back 
all 
the 
difficulties 
that 
we 
had 
overcome 
by 
the 
principle 
itself. 
That 
law 
so 
general, 
wherein 
are 
mingled 
the 
vague 
and 
unfamiliar 
ideas 
of 
infinitely 
small 
movements 
and 
of 
perturbations 
of 
equilibrium, 
only 
grew 
obscure 
upon 
examination; 
and 
the 
work 
of 
Lagrange 
supplying 
nothing 
clearer 
than 
the 
march 
of 
analysis, 
we 
saw 
plainly 
that 
the 
clouds 
had 
only 
appeared 
lifted 
from 
the 
course 
of 
mechanics 
because 
they 
had, 
so 
to 
speak, 
been 
gathered 
at 
the 
very 
origin 
of 
that 
science. 


"At 
bottom, 
a 
general 
demonstration 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
velocities 
would 
be 
equivalent 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
whole 
of 
mechanics 
upon 
a 
different 
basis: 
for 
the 
demonstration 
of 
a 
law 
which 
embraces 
a 
whole 
science 
is 
neither 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
the 
reduction 
of 
that 
science 
to 
another 
law 
just 
as 
general, 
but 
evident, 
or 
at 
least 
more 
simple 
than 
the 
first, 
and 
which, 
consequently, 
would 
render 
that 
useless." 
[50] 


According 
to 
Poinsot, 
therefore, 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
movements 
is 
tantamount 
to 
a 
total 
rehabilitation 
of 
mechanics. 


Another 
circumstance 
of 
discomfort 
to 
the 
mathematician 
is, 
that 
in 
the 
historical 
form 
in 
which 
mechanics 
at 
present 
exists, 
dynamics 
is 
founded 
on 
statics, 
whereas 
it 
is 
desirable 
that 
in 
a 
science 
which 
pretends 
to 
deductive 
completeness 
the 
more 
special 
statical 
theorems 
should 
be 
deducible 
from 
the 
more 
general 
dynamical 
principles. 


In 
fact, 
a 
great 
master, 
Gauss, 
gave 
expression 
to 
this 
desire 
in 
his 
presentment 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
least 
constraint 
(Crelle's 
Journal 
für 
reine 
und 
angewandte 
Mathematik, 
Vol. 
IV, 
p. 
233) 
in 
the 
following 
words: 
"Proper 
as 
it 
is 
that 
in 
the 
gradual 
development 
of 
a 
science, 
and 
in 
the 
instruction 
of 
individuals, 
the 
easy 
should 
precede 
the 
difficult, 
the 
simple 
the 
complex, 
the 
special 
the 
general, 
yet 
the 
mind, 
when 
once 
it 
has 
reached 
a 
higher 
point 
of 



view, 
demands 
the 
contrary 
course, 
in 
which 
all 
statics 
shall 
appear 
simply 
as 
a 
special 
case 
of 
mechanics." 
Gauss's 
own 
principle, 
now, 
possesses 
all 
the 
requisites 
of 
universality, 
but 
its 
difficulty 
is 
that 
it 
is 
not 
immediately 
intelligible 
and 
that 
Gauss 
deduced 
it 
with 
the 
help 
of 
D'Alembert's 
principle, 
a 
procedure 
which 
left 
matters 
where 
they 
were 
before. 


Whence, 
now, 
is 
derived 
this 
strange 
part 
which 
the 
principle 
of 
virtual 
motion 
plays 
in 
mechanics? 
For 
the 
present 
I 
shall 
only 
make 
this 
reply. 
It 
would 
be 
difficult 
for 
me 
to 
tell 
the 
difference 
of 
impression 
which 
Lagrange's 
proof 
of 
the 
principle 
made 
on 
me 
when 
I 
first 
took 
it 
up 
as 
a 
student 
and 
when 
I 
subsequently 
resumed 
it 
after 
having 
made 
historical 
researches. 
It 
first 
appeared 
to 
me 
insipid, 
chiefly 
on 
account 
of 
the 
pulleys 
and 
the 
cords 
which 
did 
not 
fit 
in 
with 
the 
mathematical 
view, 
and 
whose 
action 
I 
would 
much 
rather 
have 
discovered 
from 
the 
principle 
itself 
than 
have 
taken 
for 
granted. 
But 
now 
that 
I 
have 
studied 
the 
history 
of 
the 
science 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
a 
more 
beautiful 
demonstration. 


In 
fact, 
through 
all 
mechanics 
it 
is 
this 
self-same 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
which 
accomplishes 
almost 
all, 
which 
displeased 
Lagrange, 
but 
which 
he 
still 
had 
to 
employ, 
at 
least 
tacitly, 
in 
his 
own 
demonstration. 
If 
we 
give 
this 
principle 
its 
proper 
place 
and 
setting, 
the 
paradox 
is 
explained. 


The 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
is 
thus 
no 
new 
discovery; 
it 
has 
been 
the 
guiding 
idea, 
for 
three 
hundred 
years, 
of 
all 
the 
great 
inquirers. 
But 
the 
principle 
cannot 
properly 
be 
based 
upon 
mechanical 
perceptions. 
For 
long 
before 
the 
development 
of 
mechanics 
the 
conviction 
of 
its 
truth 
existed 
and 
even 
contributed 
to 
that 
development. 
Its 
power 
of 
conviction, 
therefore, 
must 
have 
more 
universal 
and 
deeper 
roots. 
We 
shall 
revert 
to 
this 
point. 


II. 
MECHANICAL 
PHYSICS. 
It 
cannot 
be 
denied 
that 
an 
unmistakable 
tendency 
has 
prevailed, 
from 
Democritus 
to 
the 
present 
day, 
to 
explain 
all 
physical 
events 
mechanically. 
Not 
to 
mention 
earlier 
obscure 
expressions 
of 
that 
tendency 
we 
read 
in 
Huygens 
the 
following: 
[51] 


"There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
light 
consists 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
certain 



substance. 
For 
if 
we 
examine 
its 
production, 
we 
find 
that 
here 
on 
earth 
it 
is 
principally 
fire 
and 
flame 
which 
engender 
it, 
both 
of 
which 
contain 
beyond 
doubt 
bodies 
which 
are 
in 
rapid 
movement, 
since 
they 
dissolve 
and 
destroy 
many 
other 
bodies 
more 
solid 
than 
they: 
while 
if 
we 
regard 
its 
effects, 
we 
see 
that 
when 
light 
is 
accumulated, 
say 
by 
concave 
mirrors, 
it 
has 
the 
property 
of 
combustion 
just 
as 
fire 
has, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
it 
disunites 
the 
parts 
of 
bodies, 
which 
is 
assuredly 
a 
proof 
of 
motion, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
true 
philosophy, 
in 
which 
the 
causes 
of 
all 
natural 
effects 
are 
conceived 
as 
mechanical 
causes. 
Which 
in 
my 
judgment 
must 
be 
accomplished 
or 
all 
hope 
of 
ever 
understanding 
physics 
renounced." 
[52] 


S. 
Carnot, 
[53] 
in 
introducing 
the 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
into 
the 
theory 
of 
heat, 
makes 
the 
following 
apology: 
"It 
will 
be 
objected 
here, 
perhaps, 
that 
a 
perpetual 
motion 
proved 
impossible 
for 
purely 
mechanical 
actions, 
is 
perhaps 
not 
so 
when 
the 
influence 
of 
heat 
or 
of 
electricity 
is 
employed. 
But 
can 
phenomena 
of 
heat 
or 
electricity 
be 
thought 
of 
as 
due 
to 
anything 
else 
than 
to 
certain 
motions 
of 
bodies, 
and 
as 
such 
must 
they 
not 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
general 
laws 
of 
mechanics?" 
[54] 


These 
examples, 
which 
might 
be 
multiplied 
by 
quotations 
from 
recent 
literature 
indefinitely, 
show 
that 
a 
tendency 
to 
explain 
all 
things 
mechanically 
actually 
exists. 
This 
tendency 
is 
also 
intelligible. 
Mechanical 
events 
as 
simple 
motions 
in 
space 
and 
time 
best 
admit 
of 
observation 
and 
pursuit 
by 
the 
help 
of 
our 
highly 
organised 
senses. 
We 
reproduce 
mechanical 
processes 
almost 
without 
effort 
in 
our 
imagination. 
Pressure 
as 
a 
circumstance 
that 
produces 
motion 
is 
very 
familiar 
to 
us 
from 
daily 
experience. 
All 
changes 
which 
the 
individual 
personally 
produces 
in 
his 
environment, 
or 
humanity 
brings 
about 
by 
means 
of 
the 
arts 
in 
the 
world, 
are 
effected 
through 
the 
instrumentality 
of 
motions. 
Almost 
of 
necessity, 
therefore, 
motion 
appears 
to 
us 
as 
the 
most 
important 
physical 
factor. 
Moreover, 
mechanical 
properties 
may 
be 
discovered 
in 
all 
physical 
events. 
The 
sounding 
bell 
trembles, 
the 
heated 
body 
expands, 
the 
electrified 
body 
attracts 
other 
bodies. 
Why, 
therefore, 
should 
we 
not 
attempt 
to 
grasp 
all 
events 
under 
their 
mechanical 
aspect, 
since 
that 
is 
so 
easily 
apprehended 
and 
most 
accessible 
to 
observation 
and 
measurement? 
In 
fact, 
no 
objection 
is 
to 
be 
made 
to 
the 
attempt 
to 
elucidate 



the 
properties 
of 
physical 
events 
by 
mechanical 
analogies. 


But 
modern 
physics 
has 
proceeded 
very 
far 
in 
this 
direction. 
The 
point 
of 
view 
which 
Wundt 
represents 
in 
his 
excellent 
treatise 
On 
the 
Physical 
Axioms 
is 
probably 
shared 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
physicists. 
The 
axioms 
of 
physics 
which 
Wundt 
sets 
up 
are 
as 
follows: 


1. 
All 
natural 
causes 
are 
motional 
causes. 
2. 
Every 
motional 
cause 
lies 
outside 
the 
object 
moved. 
3. 
All 
motional 
causes 
act 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
straight 
line 
of 
junction, 
and 
so 
forth. 
4. 
The 
effect 
of 
every 
cause 
persists. 
5. 
Every 
effect 
involves 
an 
equal 
countereffect. 
6. 
Every 
effect 
is 
equivalent 
to 
its 
cause. 
These 
principles 
might 
be 
studied 
properly 
enough 
as 
fundamental 
principles 
of 
mechanics. 
But 
when 
they 
are 
set 
up 
as 
axioms 
of 
physics, 
their 
enunciation 
is 
simply 
tantamount 
to 
a 
negation 
of 
all 
events 
except 
motion. 


According 
to 
Wundt, 
all 
changes 
of 
nature 
are 
mere 
changes 
of 
place. 
All 
causes 
are 
motional 
causes 
(page 
26). 
Any 
discussion 
of 
the 
philosophical 
grounds 
on 
which 
Wundt 
supports 
his 
theory 
would 
lead 
us 
deep 
into 
the 
speculations 
of 
the 
Eleatics 
and 
the 
Herbartians. 
Change 
of 
place, 
Wundt 
holds, 
is 
the 
only 
change 
of 
a 
thing 
in 
which 
a 
thing 
remains 
identical 
with 
itself. 
If 
a 
thing 
changed 
qualitatively, 
we 
should 
be 
obliged 
to 
imagine 
that 
something 
was 
annihilated 
and 
something 
else 
created 
in 
its 
place, 
which 
is 
not 
to 
be 
reconciled 
with 
our 
idea 
of 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
object 
observed 
and 
of 
the 
indestructibility 
of 
matter. 
But 
we 
have 
only 
to 
remember 
that 
the 
Eleatics 
encountered 
difficulties 
of 
exactly 
the 
same 
sort 
in 
motion. 
Can 
we 
not 
also 
imagine 
that 
a 
thing 
is 
destroyed 
in 
one 
place 
and 
in 
another 
an 
exactly 
similar 
thing 
created? 
After 
all, 
do 
we 
really 
know 
more 
why 
a 
body 
leaves 
one 
place 
and 
appears 
in 
another, 
than 
why 
a 
cold 
body 
grows 
warm? 
Granted 
that 
we 
had 
a 
perfect 
knowledge 
of 
the 
mechanical 
processes 
of 



nature, 
could 
we 
and 
should 
we, 
for 
that 
reason, 
put 
out 
of 
the 
world 
all 
other 
processes 
that 
we 
do 
not 
understand? 
On 
this 
principle 
it 
would 
really 
be 
the 
simplest 
course 
to 
deny 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
whole 
world. 
This 
is 
the 
point 
at 
which 
the 
Eleatics 
ultimately 
arrived, 
and 
the 
school 
of 
Herbart 
stopped 
little 
short 
of 
the 
same 
goal. 


Physics 
treated 
in 
this 
sense 
supplies 
us 
simply 
with 
a 
diagram 
of 
the 
world, 
in 
which 
we 
do 
not 
know 
reality 
again. 
It 
happens, 
in 
fact, 
to 
men 
who 
give 
themselves 
up 
to 
this 
view 
for 
many 
years, 
that 
the 
world 
of 
sense 
from 
which 
they 
start 
as 
a 
province 
of 
the 
greatest 
familiarity, 
suddenly 
becomes, 
in 
their 
eyes, 
the 
supreme 
"world-riddle." 


Intelligible 
as 
it 
is, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
efforts 
of 
thinkers 
have 
always 
been 
bent 
upon 
the 
"reduction 
of 
all 
physical 
processes 
to 
the 
motions 
of 
atoms," 
it 
must 
yet 
be 
affirmed 
that 
this 
is 
a 
chimerical 
ideal. 
This 
ideal 
has 
often 
played 
an 
effective 
part 
in 
popular 
lectures, 
but 
in 
the 
workshop 
of 
the 
serious 
inquirer 
it 
has 
discharged 
scarcely 
the 
least 
function. 
What 
has 
really 
been 
achieved 
in 
mechanical 
physics 
is 
either 
the 
elucidation 
of 
physical 
processes 
by 
more 
familiar 
mechanical 
analogies, 
(for 
example, 
the 
theories 
of 
light 
and 
of 
electricity,) 
or 
the 
exact 
quantitative 
ascertainment 
of 
the 
connexion 
of 
mechanical 
processes 
with 
other 
physical 
processes, 
for 
example, 
the 
results 
of 
thermodynamics. 


III. 
THE 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
ENERGY 
IN 
PHYSICS. 
We 
can 
know 
only 
from 
experience 
that 
mechanical 
processes 
produce 
other 
physical 
transformations, 
or 
vice 
versa. 
The 
attention 
was 
first 
directed 
to 
the 
connexion 
of 
mechanical 
processes, 
especially 
the 
performance 
of 
work, 
with 
changes 
of 
thermal 
conditions 
by 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
steam-engine, 
and 
by 
its 
great 
technical 
importance. 
Technical 
interests 
and 
the 
need 
of 
scientific 
lucidity 
meeting 
in 
the 
mind 
of 
S. 
Carnot 
led 
to 
the 
remarkable 
development 
from 
which 
thermodynamics 
flowed. 
It 
is 
simply 
an 
accident 
of 
history 
that 
the 
development 
in 
question 
was 
not 
connected 
with 
the 
practical 
applications 
of 
electricity. 


In 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
maximum 
quantity 
of 
work 
that, 
generally, 
a 
heat-
machine, 
or, 
to 
take 
a 
special 
case, 
a 
steam-engine, 
can 
perform 
with 
the 



expenditure 
of 
a 
given 
amount 
of 
heat 
of 
combustion, 
Carnot 
is 
guided 
by 
mechanical 
analogies. 
A 
body 
can 
do 
work 
on 
being 
heated, 
by 
expanding 
under 
pressure. 
But 
to 
do 
this 
the 
body 
must 
receive 
heat 
from 
a 
hotter 
body. 
Heat, 
therefore, 
to 
do 
work, 
must 
pass 
from 
a 
hotter 
body 
to 
a 
colder 
body, 
just 
as 
water 
must 
fall 
from 
a 
higher 
level 
to 
a 
lower 
level 
to 
put 
a 
mill-wheel 
in 
motion. 
Differences 
of 
temperature, 
accordingly, 
represent 
forces 
able 
to 
do 
work 
exactly 
as 
do 
differences 
of 
height 
in 
heavy 
bodies. 
Carnot 
pictures 
to 
himself 
an 
ideal 
process 
in 
which 
no 
heat 
flows 
away 
unused, 
that 
is, 
without 
doing 
work. 
With 
a 
given 
expenditure 
of 
heat, 
accordingly, 
this 
process 
furnishes 
the 
maximum 
of 
work. 
An 
analogue 
of 
the 
process 
would 
be 
a 
mill-wheel 
which 
scooping 
its 
water 
out 
of 
a 
higher 
level 
would 
slowly 
carry 
it 
to 
a 
lower 
level 
without 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
drop. 
A 
peculiar 
property 
of 
the 
process 
is, 
that 
with 
the 
expenditure 
of 
the 
same 
work 
the 
water 
can 
be 
raised 
again 
exactly 
to 
its 
original 
level. 
This 
property 
of 
reversibility 
is 
also 
shared 
by 
the 
process 
of 
Carnot. 
His 
process 
also 
can 
be 
reversed 
by 
the 
expenditure 
of 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
work, 
and 
the 
heat 
again 
brought 
back 
to 
its 
original 
temperature 
level. 


Suppose, 
now, 
we 
had 
two 
different 
reversible 
processes 
A, 
B, 
such 
that 
in 
A 
a 
quantity 
of 
heat, 
Q, 
flowing 
off 
from 
the 
temperature 
t 
1 
to 
the 
lower 


temperature 
t 
2 
should 
perform 
the 
work 
W, 
but 
in 
B 
under 
the 
same 
circumstances 
it 
should 
perform 
a 
greater 
quantity 
of 
work 
W 
+ 
W'; 
then, 
we 
could 
join 
B 
in 
the 
sense 
assigned 
and 
A 
in 
the 
reverse 
sense 
into 
a 
single 
process. 
Here 
A 
would 
reverse 
the 
transformation 
of 
heat 
produced 
by 
B 
and 
would 
leave 
a 
surplus 
of 
work 
W', 
produced, 
so 
to 
speak, 
from 
nothing. 
The 
combination 
would 
present 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 


With 
the 
feeling, 
now, 
that 
it 
makes 
little 
difference 
whether 
the 
mechanical 
laws 
are 
broken 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
(by 
processes 
of 
heat), 
and 
convinced 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
universal 
law-ruled 
connexion 
of 
nature, 
Carnot 
here 
excludes 
for 
the 
first 
time 
from 
the 
province 
of 
general 
physics 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 
But 
it 
follows, 
then, 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
work 
W, 
produced 
by 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
quantity 
of 
heat 
Q 
from 
a 
temperature 
t1 
to 
a 
temperature 
t2, 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
substances 
as 
also 


of 
the 
character 
of 
the 
process, 
so 
far 
as 
that 
is 
unaccompanied 
by 
loss, 
but 
is 
wholly 
dependent 
upon 
the 
temperature 
t1, 
t2. 



This 
important 
principle 
has 
been 
fully 
confirmed 
by 
the 
special 
researches 
of 
Carnot 
himself 
(1824), 
of 
Clapeyron 
(1834), 
and 
of 
Sir 
William 
Thomson 
(1849), 
now 
Lord 
Kelvin. 
The 
principle 
was 
reached 
without 
any 
assumption 
whatever 
concerning 
the 
nature 
of 
heat, 
simply 
by 
the 
exclusion 
of 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 
Carnot, 
it 
is 
true, 
was 
an 
adherent 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
Black, 
according 
to 
which 
the 
sum-total 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
in 
the 
world 
is 
constant, 
but 
so 
far 
as 
his 
investigations 
have 
been 
hitherto 
considered 
the 
decision 
on 
this 
point 
is 
of 
no 
consequence. 
Carnot's 
principle 
led 
to 
the 
most 
remarkable 
results. 
W. 
Thomson 
(1848) 
founded 
upon 
it 
the 
ingenious 
idea 
of 
an 
"absolute" 
scale 
of 
temperature. 
James 
Thomson 
(1849) 
conceived 
a 
Carnot 
process 
to 
take 
place 
with 
water 
freezing 
under 
pressure 
and, 
therefore, 
performing 
work. 
He 
discovered, 
thus, 
that 
the 
freezing 
point 
is 
lowered 
0·0075° 
Celsius 
by 
every 
additional 
atmosphere 
of 
pressure. 
This 
is 
mentioned 
merely 
as 
an 
example. 


About 
twenty 
years 
after 
the 
publication 
of 
Carnot's 
book 
a 
further 
advance 
was 
made 
by 
J. 
R. 
Mayer 
and 
J. 
P. 
Joule. 
Mayer, 
while 
engaged 
as 
a 
physician 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
Dutch, 
observed, 
during 
a 
process 
of 
bleeding 
in 
Java, 
an 
unusual 
redness 
of 
the 
venous 
blood. 
In 
agreement 
with 
Liebig's 
theory 
of 
animal 
heat 
he 
connected 
this 
fact 
with 
the 
diminished 
loss 
of 
heat 
in 
warmer 
climates, 
and 
with 
the 
diminished 
expenditure 
of 
organic 
combustibles. 
The 
total 
expenditure 
of 
heat 
of 
a 
man 
at 
rest 
must 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
total 
heat 
of 
combustion. 
But 
since 
all 
organic 
actions, 
even 
the 
mechanical 
actions, 
must 
be 
set 
down 
to 
the 
credit 
of 
the 
heat 
of 
combustion, 
some 
connexion 
must 
exist 
between 
mechanical 
work 
and 
expenditure 
of 
heat. 


Joule 
started 
from 
quite 
similar 
convictions 
concerning 
the 
galvanic 
battery. 
A 
heat 
of 
association 
equivalent 
to 
the 
consumption 
of 
the 
zinc 
can 
be 
made 
to 
appear 
in 
the 
galvanic 
cell. 
If 
a 
current 
is 
set 
up, 
a 
part 
of 
this 
heat 
appears 
in 
the 
conductor 
of 
the 
current. 
The 
interposition 
of 
an 
apparatus 
for 
the 
decomposition 
of 
water 
causes 
a 
part 
of 
this 
heat 
to 
disappear, 
which 
on 
the 
burning 
of 
the 
explosive 
gas 
formed, 
is 
reproduced. 
If 
the 
current 
runs 
an 
electromotor, 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
heat 
again 
disappears, 
which, 
on 
the 
consumption 
of 
the 
work 
by 
friction, 
again 
makes 
its 
appearance. 
Accordingly, 
both 
the 
heat 
produced 
and 
the 
work 
produced, 
appeared 
to 
Joule 
also 
as 
connected 
with 
the 
consumption 
of 
material. 
The 
thought 
was 



therefore 
present, 
both 
to 
Mayer 
and 
to 
Joule, 
of 
regarding 
heat 
and 
work 
as 
equivalent 
quantities, 
so 
connected 
with 
each 
other 
that 
what 
is 
lost 
in 
one 
form 
universally 
appears 
in 
another. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
was 
a 
substantial 
conception 
of 
heat 
and 
of 
work, 
and 
ultimately 
a 
substantial 
conception 
of 
energy. 
Here 
every 
physical 
change 
of 
condition 
is 
regarded 
as 
energy, 
the 
destruction 
of 
which 
generates 
work 
or 
equivalent 
heat. 
An 
electric 
charge, 
for 
example, 
is 
energy. 


In 
1842 
Mayer 
had 
calculated 
from 
the 
physical 
constants 
then 
universally 
accepted 
that 
by 
the 
disappearance 
of 
one 
kilogramme-calorie 
365 
kilogramme-metres 
of 
work 
could 
be 
performed, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
Joule, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
by 
a 
long 
series 
of 
delicate 
and 
varied 
experiments 
beginning 
in 
1843 
ultimately 
determined 
the 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
the 
kilogrammecalorie, 
more 
exactly, 
as 
425 
kilogramme-metres. 


If 
we 
estimate 
every 
change 
of 
physical 
condition 
by 
the 
mechanical 
work 
which 
can 
be 
performed 
upon 
the 
disappearance 
of 
that 
condition, 
and 
call 
this 
measure 
energy, 
then 
we 
can 
measure 
all 
physical 
changes 
of 
condition, 
no 
matter 
how 
different 
they 
may 
be, 
with 
the 
same 
common 
measure, 
and 
say: 
the 
sum-total 
of 
all 
energy 
remains 
constant. 
This 
is 
the 
form 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
received 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
Mayer, 
Joule, 
Helmholtz, 
and 
W. 
Thomson 
in 
its 
extension 
to 
the 
whole 
domain 
of 
physics. 


After 
it 
had 
been 
proved 
that 
heat 
must 
disappear 
if 
mechanical 
work 
was 
to 
be 
done 
at 
its 
expense, 
Carnot's 
principle 
could 
no 
longer 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
complete 
expression 
of 
the 
facts. 
Its 
improved 
form 
was 
first 
given, 
in 
1850, 
by 
Clausius, 
whom 
Thomson 
followed 
in 
1851. 
It 
runs 
thus: 
"If 
a 
quantity 
of 
heat 
Q' 
is 
transformed 
into 
work 
in 
a 
reversible 
process, 
another 
quantity 
of 
heat 
Q 
of 
the 
absolute 
[55] 
temperature 
T1 
is 
lowered 
to 
the 
absolute 


temperature 
T2 
." 
Here 
Q' 
is 
dependent 
only 
on 
Q, 
T1 
, 
T2 
, 
but 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
substances 
used 
and 
of 
the 
character 
of 
the 
process, 
so 
far 
as 
that 
is 
unaccompanied 
by 
loss. 
Owing 
to 
this 
last 
fact, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
to 
find 
the 
relation 
which 
obtains 
for 
some 
one 
well-known 
physical 
substance, 
say 
a 
gas, 
and 
some 
definite 
simple 
process. 
The 
relation 
found 
will 
be 
the 
one 
that 
holds 
generally. 
We 
get, 
thus, 


Q'/(Q' 
+ 
Q) 
= 
(T1-T2)/T1 
(1) 



that 
is, 
the 
quotient 
of 
the 
available 
heat 
Q' 
transformed 
into 
work 
divided 
by 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
transformed 
and 
transferred 
heats 
(the 
total 
sum 
used), 
the 
so-
called 
economical 
coefficient 
of 
the 
process, 
is, 


(T1-T2)/T1 
. 


IV. 
THE 
CONCEPTIONS 
OF 
HEAT. 
When 
a 
cold 
body 
is 
put 
in 
contact 
with 
a 
warm 
body 
it 
is 
observed 
that 
the 
first 
body 
is 
warmed 
and 
that 
the 
second 
body 
is 
cooled. 
We 
may 
say 
that 
the 
first 
body 
is 
warmed 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
second 
body. 
This 
suggests 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
thing, 
or 
heat-substance, 
which 
passes 
from 
the 
one 
body 
to 
the 
other. 
If 
two 
masses 
of 
water 
m, 
m', 
of 
unequal 
temperatures, 
be 
put 
together, 
it 
will 
be 
found, 
upon 
the 
rapid 
equalisation 
of 
the 
temperatures, 
that 
the 
respective 
changes 
of 
temperatures 
u 
and 
u' 
are 
inversely 
proportional 
to 
the 
masses 
and 
of 
opposite 
signs, 
so 
that 
the 
algebraical 
sum 
of 
the 
products 
is, 


mu 
+ 
m'u' 
= 
0. 


Black 
called 
the 
products 
mu, 
m'u', 
which 
are 
decisive 
for 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
process, 
quantities 
of 
heat. 
We 
may 
form 
a 
very 
clear 
picture 
of 
these 
products 
by 
conceiving 
them 
with 
Black 
as 
measures 
of 
the 
quantities 
of 
some 
substance. 
But 
the 
essential 
thing 
is 
not 
this 
picture 
but 
the 
constancy 
of 
the 
sum 
of 
these 
products 
in 
simple 
processes 
of 
conduction. 
If 
a 
quantity 
of 
heat 
disappears 
at 
one 
point, 
an 
equally 
large 
quantity 
will 
make 
its 
appearance 
at 
some 
other 
point. 
The 
retention 
of 
this 
idea 
leads 
to 
the 
discovery 
of 
specific 
heat. 
Black, 
finally, 
perceives 
that 
also 
something 
else 
may 
appear 
for 
a 
vanished 
quantity 
of 
heat, 
namely: 
the 
fusion 
or 
vaporisation 
of 
a 
definite 
quantity 
of 
matter. 
He 
adheres 
here 
still 
to 
this 
favorite 
view, 
though 
with 
some 
freedom, 
and 
considers 
the 
vanished 
quantity 
of 
heat 
as 
still 
present, 
but 
as 
latent. 


The 
generally 
accepted 
notion 
of 
a 
caloric, 
or 
heat-stuff, 
was 
strongly 
shaken 
by 
the 
work 
of 
Mayer 
and 
Joule. 
If 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
can 
be 
increased 
and 
diminished, 
people 
said, 
heat 
cannot 
be 
a 
substance, 
but 
must 
be 
a 
motion. 
The 
subordinate 
part 
of 
this 
statement 
has 
become 
much 
more 
popular 
than 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
energy. 
But 
we 
may 
convince 
ourselves 
that 
the 



motional 
conception 
of 
heat 
is 
now 
as 
unessential 
as 
was 
formerly 
its 
conception 
as 
a 
substance. 
Both 
ideas 
were 
favored 
or 
impeded 
solely 
by 
accidental 
historical 
circumstances. 
It 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
heat 
is 
not 
a 
substance 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
mechanical 
equivalent 
exists 
for 
quantity 
of 
heat. 
We 
will 
make 
this 
clear 
by 
the 
following 
question 
which 
bright 
students 
have 
sometimes 
put 
to 
me. 
Is 
there 
a 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
electricity 
as 
there 
is 
a 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
heat? 
Yes, 
and 
no. 
There 
is 
no 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
as 
there 
is 
an 
equivalent 
of 
quantity 
of 
heat, 
because 
the 
same 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
has 
a 
very 
different 
capacity 
for 
work, 
according 
to 
the 
circumstances 
in 
which 
it 
is 
placed; 
but 
there 
is 
a 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
electrical 
energy. 


Let 
us 
ask 
another 
question. 
Is 
there 
a 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
water? 
No, 
there 
is 
no 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
quantity 
of 
water, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
weight 
of 
water 
multiplied 
by 
its 
distance 
of 
descent. 


When 
a 
Leyden 
jar 
is 
discharged 
and 
work 
thereby 
performed, 
we 
do 
not 
picture 
to 
ourselves 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
disappears 
as 
work 
is 
done, 
but 
we 
simply 
assume 
that 
the 
electricities 
come 
into 
different 
positions, 
equal 
quantities 
of 
positive 
and 
negative 
electricity 
being 
united 
with 
one 
another. 


What, 
now, 
is 
the 
reason 
of 
this 
difference 
of 
view 
in 
our 
treatment 
of 
heat 
and 
of 
electricity? 
The 
reason 
is 
purely 
historical, 
wholly 
conventional, 
and, 
what 
is 
still 
more 
important, 
is 
wholly 
indifferent. 
I 
may 
be 
allowed 
to 
establish 
this 
assertion. 


In 
1785 
Coulomb 
constructed 
his 
torsion 
balance, 
by 
which 
he 
was 
enabled 
to 
measure 
the 
repulsion 
of 
electrified 
bodies. 
Suppose 
we 
have 
two 
small 
balls, 
A, 
B, 
which 
over 
their 
whole 
extent 
are 
similarly 
electrified. 
These 
two 
balls 
will 
exert 
on 
one 
another, 
at 
a 
certain 
distance 
r 
of 
their 
centres, 
a 
certain 
repulsion 
p. 
We 
bring 
into 
contact 
with 
B 
now 
a 
ball 
C, 
suffer 
both 
to 
be 
equally 
electrified, 
and 
then 
measure 
the 
repulsion 
of 
B 
from 
A 
and 
of 
C 
from 
A 
at 
the 
same 
distance 
r. 
The 
sum 
of 
these 
repulsions 
is 
again 
p. 
Accordingly 
something 
has 
remained 
constant. 
If 
we 
ascribe 
this 
effect 
to 
a 
substance, 
then 
we 
infer 
naturally 
its 
constancy. 
But 
the 
essential 
point 
of 
the 
exposition 
is 
the 
divisibility 
of 
the 
electric 
force 
p 
and 
not 
the 
simile 
of 



substance. 


In 
1838 
Riess 
constructed 
his 
electrical 
air-thermometer 
(the 
thermoelectrometer). 
This 
gives 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
produced 
by 
the 
discharge 
of 
jars. 
This 
quantity 
of 
heat 
is 
not 
proportional 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
contained 
in 
the 
jar 
by 
Coulomb's 
measure, 
but 
if 
Q 
be 
this 
quantity 
and 
C 
be 
the 
capacity, 
is 
proportional 
to 
Q 
2/2C, 
or, 
more 
simply 
still, 
to 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
charged 
jar. 
If, 
now, 
we 
discharge 
the 
jar 
completely 
through 
the 
thermometer, 
we 
obtain 
a 
certain 
quantity 
of 
heat, 
W. 
But 
if 
we 
make 
the 
discharge 
through 
the 
thermometer 
into 
a 
second 
jar, 
we 
obtain 
a 
quantity 
less 
than 
W. 
But 
we 
may 
obtain 
the 
remainder 
by 
completely 
discharging 
both 
jars 
through 
the 
air-thermometer, 
when 
it 
will 
again 
be 
proportional 
to 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
two 
jars. 
On 
the 
first, 
incomplete 
discharge, 
accordingly, 
a 
part 
of 
the 
electricity's 
capacity 
for 
work 
was 
lost. 


When 
the 
charge 
of 
a 
jar 
produces 
heat 
its 
energy 
is 
changed 
and 
its 
value 
by 
Riess's 
thermometer 
is 
decreased. 
But 
by 
Coulomb's 
measure 
the 
quantity 
remains 
unaltered. 


Now 
let 
us 
imagine 
that 
Riess's 
thermometer 
had 
been 
invented 
before 
Coulomb's 
torsion 
balance, 
which 
is 
not 
a 
difficult 
feat, 
since 
both 
inventions 
are 
independent 
of 
each 
other; 
what 
would 
be 
more 
natural 
than 
that 
the 
"quantity" 
of 
electricity 
contained 
in 
a 
jar 
should 
be 
measured 
by 
the 
heat 
produced 
in 
the 
thermometer? 
But 
then, 
this 
so-called 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
would 
decrease 
on 
the 
production 
of 
heat 
or 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
work, 
whereas 
it 
now 
remains 
unchanged; 
in 
that 
case, 
therefore, 
electricity 
would 
not 
be 
a 
substance 
but 
a 
motion, 
whereas 
now 
it 
is 
still 
a 
substance. 
The 
reason, 
therefore, 
why 
we 
have 
other 
notions 
of 
electricity 
than 
we 
have 
of 
heat, 
is 
purely 
historical, 
accidental, 
and 
conventional. 


This 
is 
also 
the 
case 
with 
other 
physical 
things. 
Water 
does 
not 
disappear 
when 
work 
is 
done. 
Why? 
Because 
we 
measure 
quantity 
of 
water 
with 
scales, 
just 
as 
we 
do 
electricity. 
But 
suppose 
the 
capacity 
of 
water 
for 
work 
were 
called 
quantity, 
and 
had 
to 
be 
measured, 
therefore, 
by 
a 
mill 
instead 
of 
by 
scales; 
then 
this 
quantity 
also 
would 
disappear 
as 
it 
performed 
the 
work. 
It 
may, 
now, 
be 
easily 
conceived 
that 
many 
substances 
are 
not 
so 
easily 
got 
at 
as 
water. 
In 
that 
case 
we 
should 
be 
unable 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
one 
kind 
of 
measurement 
with 
the 
scales 
whilst 
many 
other 
modes 
of 
measurement 



would 
still 
be 
left 
us. 


In 
the 
case 
of 
heat, 
now, 
the 
historically 
established 
measure 
of 
"quantity" 
is 
accidentally 
the 
work-value 
of 
the 
heat. 
Accordingly, 
its 
quantity 
disappears 
when 
work 
is 
done. 
But 
that 
heat 
is 
not 
a 
substance 
follows 
from 
this 
as 
little 
as 
does 
the 
opposite 
conclusion 
that 
it 
is 
a 
substance. 
In 
Black's 
case 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
remains 
constant 
because 
the 
heat 
passes 
into 
no 
other 
form 
of 
energy. 


If 
any 
one 
to-day 
should 
still 
wish 
to 
think 
of 
heat 
as 
a 
substance, 
we 
might 
allow 
that 
person 
this 
liberty 
with 
little 
ado. 
He 
would 
only 
have 
to 
assume 
that 
that 
which 
we 
call 
quantity 
of 
heat 
was 
the 
energy 
of 
a 
substance 
whose 
quantity 
remained 
unaltered, 
but 
whose 
energy 
changed. 
In 
point 
of 
fact 
we 
might 
much 
better 
say, 
in 
analogy 
with 
the 
other 
terms 
of 
physics, 
energy 
of 
heat, 
instead 
of 
quantity 
of 
heat. 


When 
we 
wonder, 
therefore, 
at 
the 
discovery 
that 
heat 
is 
motion, 
we 
wonder 
at 
something 
that 
was 
never 
discovered. 
It 
is 
perfectly 
indifferent 
and 
possesses 
not 
the 
slightest 
scientific 
value, 
whether 
we 
think 
of 
heat 
as 
a 
substance 
or 
not. 
The 
fact 
is, 
heat 
behaves 
in 
some 
connexions 
like 
a 
substance, 
in 
others 
not. 
Heat 
is 
latent 
in 
steam 
as 
oxygen 
is 
latent 
in 
water. 


V. 
THE 
CONFORMITY 
IN 
THE 
DEPORTMENT 
OF 
THE 
ENERGIES. 
The 
foregoing 
reflexions 
will 
gain 
in 
lucidity 
from 
a 
consideration 
of 
the 
conformity 
which 
obtains 
in 
the 
behavior 
of 
all 
energies, 
a 
point 
to 
which 
I 
called 
attention 
long 
ago. 
[56] 


A 
weight 
P 
at 
a 
height 
H 
1 
represents 
an 
energy 
W 
1= 
PH 
1. 
If 
we 
suffer 
the 
weight 
to 
sink 
to 
a 
lower 
height 
H 
2, 
during 
which 
work 
is 
done, 
and 
the 
work 
done 
is 
employed 
in 
the 
production 
of 
living 
force, 
heat, 
or 
an 
electric 
charge, 


in 
short, 
is 
transformed, 
then 
the 
energy 
W 
2= 
PH 
2 
is 
still 
left. 
The 
equation 
subsists 


W 
1/H 
1= 
W 
2/H 
2, 
(2) 
or, 
denoting 
the 
transformed 
energy 
by 
W'= 
W 
1-W 
2 



and 
the 
transferred 
energy, 
that 
transported 
to 
the 
lower 
level, 
by 
W 
= 
W 
2, 


W'/(W'+ 
W)=(H 
1-H 
2)/H 
1, 
(3) 


an 
equation 
in 
all 
respects 
analogous 
to 
equation 
(1) 
at 
page 
165. 
The 
property 
in 
question, 
therefore, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
peculiar 
to 
heat. 
Equation 
(2) 
gives 
the 
relation 
between 
the 
energy 
taken 
from 
the 
higher 
level 
and 
that 
deposited 
on 
the 
lower 
level 
(the 
energy 
left 
behind); 
it 
says 
that 
these 
energies 
are 
proportional 
to 
the 
heights 
of 
the 
levels. 
An 
equation 
analogous 
to 
equation 
(2) 
may 
be 
set 
up 
for 
every 
form 
of 
energy; 
hence 
the 
equation 
which 
corresponds 
to 
equation 
(3), 
and 
so 
to 
equation 
(1), 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
valid 
for 
every 
form. 
For 
electricity, 
for 
example, 
H 
1, 
H 
2 
signify 
the 


potentials. 


When 
we 
observe 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
agreement 
here 
indicated 
in 
the 
transformative 
law 
of 
the 
energies, 
it 
appears 
surprising 
and 
unexpected, 
for 
we 
do 
not 
perceive 
at 
once 
its 
reason. 
But 
to 
him 
who 
pursues 
the 
comparative 
historical 
method 
that 
reason 
will 
not 
long 
remain 
a 
secret. 


Since 
Galileo, 
mechanical 
work, 
though 
long 
under 
a 
different 
name, 
has 
been 
a 
fundamental 
concept 
of 
mechanics, 
as 
also 
a 
very 
important 
notion 
in 
the 
applied 
sciences. 
The 
transformation 
of 
work 
into 
living 
force, 
and 
of 
living 
force 
into 
work, 
suggests 
directly 
the 
notion 
of 
energy—the 
idea 
having 
been 
first 
fruitfully 
employed 
by 
Huygens, 
although 
Thomas 
Young 
first 
called 
it 
by 
the 
name 
of 
"energy." 
Let 
us 
add 
to 
this 
the 
constancy 
of 
weight 
(really 
the 
constancy 
of 
mass) 
and 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
with 
respect 
to 
mechanical 
energy 
it 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
very 
definition 
of 
the 
term 
that 
the 
capacity 
for 
work 
or 
the 
potential 
energy 
of 
a 
weight 
is 
proportional 
to 
the 
height 
of 
the 
level 
at 
which 
it 
is, 
in 
the 
geometrical 
sense, 
and 
that 
it 
decreases 
on 
the 
lowering 
of 
the 
weight, 
on 
transformation, 
proportionally 
to 
the 
height 
of 
the 
level. 
The 
zero 
level 
here 
is 
wholly 
arbitrary. 
With 
this, 
equation 
(2) 
is 
given, 
from 
which 
all 
the 
other 
forms 
follow. 


When 
we 
reflect 
on 
the 
tremendous 
start 
which 
mechanics 
had 
over 
the 
other 
branches 
of 
physics, 
it 
is 
not 
to 
be 
wondered 
at 
that 
the 
attempt 
was 
always 
made 
to 
apply 
the 
notions 
of 
that 
science 
wherever 
this 
was 
possible. 
Thus 
the 
notion 
of 
mass, 
for 
example, 
was 
imitated 
by 
Coulomb 
in 
the 
notion 
of 



quantity 
of 
electricity. 
In 
the 
further 
development 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
electricity, 
the 
notion 
of 
work 
was 
likewise 
immediately 
introduced 
in 
the 
theory 
of 
potential, 
and 
heights 
of 
electrical 
level 
were 
measured 
by 
the 
work 
of 
unit 
of 
quantity 
raised 
to 
that 
level. 
But 
with 
this 
the 
preceding 
equation 
with 
all 
its 
consequences 
is 
given 
for 
electrical 
energy. 
The 
case 
with 
the 
other 
energies 
was 
similar. 


Thermal 
energy, 
however, 
appears 
as 
a 
special 
case. 
Only 
by 
the 
peculiar 
experiments 
mentioned 
could 
it 
be 
discovered 
that 
heat 
is 
an 
energy. 
But 
the 
measure 
of 
this 
energy 
by 
Black's 
quantity 
of 
heat 
is 
the 
outcome 
of 
fortuitous 
circumstances. 
In 
the 
first 
place, 
the 
accidental 
slight 
variability 
of 
the 
capacity 
for 
heat 
c 
with 
the 
temperature, 
and 
the 
accidental 
slight 
deviation 
of 
the 
usual 
thermometrical 
scales 
from 
the 
scale 
derived 
from 
the 
tensions 
of 
gases, 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
the 
notion 
"quantity 
of 
heat" 
can 
be 
set 
up 
and 
that 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
ct 
corresponding 
to 
a 
difference 
of 
temperature 
t 
is 
nearly 
proportional 
to 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
heat. 
It 
is 
a 
quite 
accidental 
historical 
circumstance 
that 
Amontons 
hit 
upon 
the 
idea 
of 
measuring 
temperature 
by 
the 
tension 
of 
a 
gas. 
It 
is 
certain 
in 
this 
that 
he 
did 
not 
think 
of 
the 
work 
of 
the 
heat. 
[57] 
But 
the 
numbers 
standing 
for 
temperature, 
thus, 
are 
made 
proportional 
to 
the 
tensions 
of 
gases, 
that 
is, 
to 
the 
work 
done 
by 
gases, 
with 
otherwise 
equal 
changes 
of 
volume. 
It 
thus 
happens 
that 
temperature 
heights 
and 
level 
heights 
of 
work 
are 
proportional 
to 
one 
another. 


If 
properties 
of 
the 
thermal 
condition 
varying 
greatly 
from 
the 
tensions 
of 
gases 
had 
been 
chosen, 
this 
relation 
would 
have 
assumed 
very 
complicated 
forms, 
and 
the 
agreement 
between 
heat 
and 
the 
other 
energies 
above 
considered 
would 
not 
subsist. 
It 
is 
very 
instructive 
to 
reflect 
upon 
this 
point. 
A 
natural 
law, 
therefore, 
is 
not 
implied 
in 
the 
conformity 
of 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
energies, 
but 
this 
conformity 
is 
rather 
conditioned 
by 
the 
uniformity 
of 
our 
modes 
of 
conception 
and 
is 
also 
partly 
a 
matter 
of 
good 
fortune. 


VI. 
THE 
DIFFERENCES 
OF 
THE 
ENERGIES 
AND 
THE 
LIMITS 
OF 
THE 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
ENERGY. 
Of 
every 
quantity 
of 
heat 
Q 
which 
does 
work 
in 
a 
reversible 
process 
(one 
unaccompanied 
by 
loss) 
between 
the 
absolute 
temperatures 
T 
1, 
T 
2, 
only 
the 



portion 


(T 
1-T 
2)/T 
1 


is 
transformed 
into 
work, 
while 
the 
remainder 
is 
transferred 
to 
the 
lower 
temperature-level 
T 
2. 
This 
transferred 
portion 
can, 
upon 
the 
reversal 
of 
the 
process, 
with 
the 
same 
expenditure 
of 
work, 
again 
be 
brought 
back 
to 
the 
level 
T 
1. 
But 
if 
the 
process 
is 
not 
reversible, 
then 
more 
heat 
than 
in 
the 
foregoing 
case 
flows 
to 
the 
lower 
level, 
and 
the 
surplus 
can 
no 
longer 
be 


brought 
back 
to 
the 
higher 
level 
T 
2 
without 
some 
special 
expenditure. 
W. 
Thomson 
(1852), 
accordingly, 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
fact, 
that 
in 
all 
non-
reversible, 
that 
is, 
in 
all 
real 
thermal 
processes, 
quantities 
of 
heat 
are 
lost 
for 
mechanical 
work, 
and 
that 
accordingly 
a 
dissipation 
or 
waste 
of 
mechanical 
energy 
is 
taking 
place. 
In 
all 
cases, 
heat 
is 
only 
partially 
transformed 
into 
work, 
but 
frequently 
work 
is 
wholly 
transformed 
into 
heat. 
Hence, 
a 
tendency 
exists 
towards 
a 
diminution 
of 
the 
mechanical 
energy 
and 
towards 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
thermal 
energy 
of 
the 
world. 


For 
a 
simple, 
closed 
cyclical 
process, 
accompanied 
by 
no 
loss, 
in 
which 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
Q_{1} 
is 
taken 
from 
the 
level 
T_{1}, 
and 
the 
quantity 
Q_{2} 
is 
deposited 
upon 
the 
level 
T_{2}, 
the 
following 
relation, 
agreeably 
to 
equation 
(2), 
exists, 


-(Q 
1/T 
1) 
+ 
(Q 
2/T 
2) 
= 
0. 


Similarly, 
for 
any 
number 
of 
compound 
reversible 
cycles 
Clausius 
finds 
the 
algebraical 
sum 


ΣQ/T 
= 
0, 


and 
supposing 
the 
temperature 
to 
change 
continuously, 


∫dQ/T 
= 
0 
(4) 


Here 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
quantities 
of 
heat 
deducted 
from 
a 
given 
level 
are 
reckoned 
negative, 
and 
the 
elements 
imparted 
to 
it, 
positive. 
If 
the 
process 
is 
not 
reversible, 
then 
expression 
(4), 
which 
Clausius 
calls 
entropy, 
increases. 
In 



actual 
practice 
this 
is 
always 
the 
case, 
and 
Clausius 
finds 
himself 
led 
to 
the 
statement: 


1. 
That 
the 
energy 
of 
the 
world 
remains 
constant. 
2. 
That 
the 
entropy 
of 
the 
world 
tends 
toward 
a 
maximum. 
Once 
we 
have 
noted 
the 
above-indicated 
conformity 
in 
the 
behavior 
of 
different 
energies, 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
thermal 
energy 
here 
mentioned 
must 
strike 
us. 
Whence 
is 
this 
peculiarity 
derived, 
for, 
generally 
every 
energy 
passes 
only 
partly 
into 
another 
form, 
which 
is 
also 
true 
of 
thermal 
energy? 
The 
explanation 
will 
be 
found 
in 
the 
following. 


Every 
transformation 
of 
a 
special 
kind 
of 
energy 
A 
is 
accompanied 
with 
a 
fall 
of 
potential 
of 
that 
particular 
kind 
of 
energy, 
including 
heat. 
But 
whilst 
for 
the 
other 
kinds 
of 
energy 
a 
transformation 
and 
therefore 
a 
loss 
of 
energy 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
kind 
sinking 
in 
potential 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
potential, 
with 
heat 
the 
case 
is 
different. 
Heat 
can 
suffer 
a 
fall 
of 
potential 
without 
sustaining 
a 
loss 
of 
energy, 
at 
least 
according 
to 
the 
customary 
mode 
of 
estimation. 
If 
a 
weight 
sinks, 
it 
must 
create 
perforce 
kinetic 
energy, 
or 
heat, 
or 
some 
other 
form 
of 
energy. 
Also, 
an 
electrical 
charge 
cannot 
suffer 
a 
fall 
of 
potential 
without 
loss 
of 
energy, 
i. 
e., 
without 
transformation. 
But 
heat 
can 
pass 
with 
a 
fall 
of 
temperature 
to 
a 
body 
of 
greater 
capacity 
and 
the 
same 
thermal 
energy 
still 
be 
preserved, 
so 
long 
as 
we 
regard 
every 
quantity 
of 
heat 
as 
energy. 
This 
it 
is 
that 
gives 
to 
heat, 
besides 
its 
property 
of 
energy, 
in 
many 
cases 
the 
character 
of 
a 
material 
substance, 
or 
quantity. 


If 
we 
look 
at 
the 
matter 
in 
an 
unprejudiced 
light, 
we 
must 
ask 
if 
there 
is 
any 
scientific 
sense 
or 
purpose 
in 
still 
considering 
as 
energy 
a 
quantity 
of 
heat 
that 
can 
no 
longer 
be 
transformed 
into 
mechanical 
work, 
(for 
example, 
the 
heat 
of 
a 
closed 
equably 
warmed 
material 
system). 
The 
principle 
of 
energy 
certainly 
plays 
in 
this 
case 
a 
wholly 
superfluous 
rôle, 
which 
is 
assigned 
to 
it 
only 
from 
habit. 
[58] 
To 
maintain 
the 
principle 
of 
energy 
in 
the 
face 
of 
a 
knowledge 
of 
the 
dissipation 
or 
waste 
of 
mechanical 
energy, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
increase 
of 
entropy 
is 
equivalent 
almost 
to 
the 
liberty 
which 
Black 
took 
when 
he 
regarded 
the 
heat 
of 
liquefaction 
as 
still 
present 
but 
latent. 
[59] 
It 
is 
to 
be 
remarked 
further, 
that 
the 
expressions 
"energy 
of 
the 
world" 
and 
"entropy 
of 
the 
world" 
are 
slightly 
permeated 
with 
scholasticism. 
Energy 
and 
entropy 



are 
metrical 
notions. 
What 
meaning 
can 
there 
be 
in 
applying 
these 
notions 
to 
a 
case 
in 
which 
they 
are 
not 
applicable, 
in 
which 
their 
values 
are 
not 
determinable? 


If 
we 
could 
really 
determine 
the 
entropy 
of 
the 
world 
it 
would 
represent 
a 
true, 
absolute 
measure 
of 
time. 
In 
this 
way 
is 
best 
seen 
the 
utter 
tautology 
of 
a 
statement 
that 
the 
entropy 
of 
the 
world 
increases 
with 
the 
time. 
Time, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
certain 
changes 
take 
place 
only 
in 
a 
definite 
sense, 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
thing. 


VII. 
THE 
SOURCES 
OF 
THE 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
ENERGY. 
We 
are 
now 
prepared 
to 
answer 
the 
question, 
What 
are 
the 
sources 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
energy? 
All 
knowledge 
of 
nature 
is 
derived 
in 
the 
last 
instance 
from 
experience. 
In 
this 
sense 
they 
are 
right 
who 
look 
upon 
the 
principle 
of 
energy 
as 
a 
result 
of 
experience. 


Experience 
teaches 
that 
the 
sense-elements 
αβγδ... 
into 
which 
the 
world 
may 
be 
decomposed, 
are 
subject 
to 
change. 
It 
tells 
us 
further, 
that 
certain 
of 
these 
elements 
are 
connected 
with 
other 
elements, 
so 
that 
they 
appear 
and 
disappear 
together; 
or, 
that 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
one 
class 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
disappearance 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
other 
class. 
We 
will 
avoid 
here 
the 
notions 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
because 
of 
their 
obscurity 
and 
equivocalness. 
The 
result 
of 
experience 
may 
be 
expressed 
as 
follows: 
The 
sensuous 
elements 
of 
the 
world 
(αβγδ...) 
show 
themselves 
to 
be 
interdependent. 
This 
interdependence 
is 
best 
represented 
by 
some 
such 
conception 
as 
is 
in 
geometry 
that 
of 
the 
mutual 
dependence 
of 
the 
sides 
and 
angles 
of 
a 
triangle, 
only 
much 
more 
varied 
and 
complex. 


As 
an 
example, 
we 
may 
take 
a 
mass 
of 
gas 
enclosed 
in 
a 
cylinder 
and 
possessed 
of 
a 
definite 
volume 
(α), 
which 
we 
change 
by 
a 
pressure 
(β) 
on 
the 
piston, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
feeling 
the 
cylinder 
with 
our 
hand 
and 
receiving 
a 
sensation 
of 
heat 
(γ). 
Increase 
of 
pressure 
diminishes 
the 
volume 
and 
increases 
the 
sensation 
of 
heat. 


The 
various 
facts 
of 
experience 
are 
not 
in 
all 
respects 
alike. 
Their 
common 
sensuous 
elements 
are 
placed 
in 
relief 
by 
a 
process 
of 
abstraction 
and 
thus 



impressed 
upon 
the 
memory. 
In 
this 
way 
the 
expression 
is 
obtained 
of 
the 
features 
of 
agreement 
of 
extensive 
groups 
of 
facts. 
The 
simplest 
sentence 
which 
we 
can 
utter 
is, 
by 
the 
very 
nature 
of 
language, 
an 
abstraction 
of 
this 
kind. 
But 
account 
must 
also 
be 
taken 
of 
the 
differences 
of 
related 
facts. 
Facts 
may 
be 
so 
nearly 
related 
as 
to 
contain 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
a 
αβγ..., 
but 
the 
relation 
be 
such 
that 
the 
αβγ... 
of 
the 
one 
differ 
from 
the 
αβγ... 
of 
the 
other 
only 
by 
the 
number 
of 
equal 
parts 
into 
which 
they 
can 
be 
divided. 
Such 
being 
the 
case, 
if 
rules 
can 
be 
given 
for 
deducing 
from 
one 
another 
the 
numbers 
which 
are 
the 
measures 
of 
these 
αβγ..., 
then 
we 
possess 
in 
such 
rules 
the 
most 
general 
expression 
of 
a 
group 
of 
facts, 
as 
also 
that 
expression 
which 
corresponds 
to 
all 
its 
differences. 
This 
is 
the 
goal 
of 
quantitative 
investigation. 


If 
this 
goal 
be 
reached 
what 
we 
have 
found 
is 
that 
between 
the 
αβγ... 
of 
a 
group 
of 
facts, 
or 
better, 
between 
the 
numbers 
which 
are 
their 
measures, 
a 
number 
of 
equations 
exists. 
The 
simple 
fact 
of 
change 
brings 
it 
about 
that 
the 
number 
of 
these 
equations 
must 
be 
smaller 
than 
the 
number 
of 
the 
αβγ.... 
If 
the 
former 
be 
smaller 
by 
one 
than 
the 
latter, 
then 
one 
portion 
of 
the 
αβγ... 
is 
uniquely 
determined 
by 
the 
other 
portion. 


The 
quest 
of 
relations 
of 
this 
last 
kind 
is 
the 
most 
important 
function 
of 
special 
experimental 
research, 
because 
we 
are 
enabled 
by 
it 
to 
complete 
in 
thought 
facts 
that 
are 
only 
partly 
given. 
It 
is 
self-evident 
that 
only 
experience 
can 
ascertain 
that 
between 
the 
αβγ... 
relations 
exist 
and 
of 
what 
kind 
they 
are. 
Further, 
only 
experience 
can 
tell 
that 
the 
relations 
that 
exist 
between 
the 
αβγ... 
are 
such 
that 
changes 
of 
them 
can 
be 
reversed. 
If 
this 
were 
not 
the 
fact 
all 
occasion 
for 
the 
enunciation 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
energy, 
as 
is 
easily 
seen, 
would 
be 
wanting. 
In 
experience, 
therefore, 
is 
buried 
the 
ultimate 
well-spring 
of 
all 
knowledge 
of 
nature, 
and 
consequently, 
in 
this 
sense, 
also 
the 
ultimate 
source 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
energy. 


But 
this 
does 
not 
exclude 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
energy 
has 
also 
a 
logical 
root, 
as 
will 
now 
be 
shown. 
Let 
us 
assume 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
experience 
that 
one 
group 
of 
sensuous 
elements 
αβγ... 
determines 
uniquely 
another 
group 
λμν.... 
Experience 
further 
teaches 
that 
changes 
of 
αβγ... 
can 
be 
reversed. 
It 
is 
then 
a 
logical 
consequence 
of 
this 
observation, 
that 
every 
time 
that 
αβγ... 
assume 
the 
same 
values 
this 
is 
also 
the 
case 
with 
λμν.... 
Or, 
that 
purely 



periodical 
changes 
of 
αβγ... 
can 
produce 
no 
permanent 
changes 
of 
λμν.... 
If 
the 
group 
λμν... 
is 
a 
mechanical 
group, 
then 
a 
perpetual 
motion 
is 
excluded. 


It 
will 
be 
said 
that 
this 
is 
a 
vicious 
circle, 
which 
we 
will 
grant. 
But 
psychologically, 
the 
situation 
is 
essentially 
different, 
whether 
I 
think 
simply 
of 
the 
unique 
determination 
and 
reversibility 
of 
events, 
or 
whether 
I 
exclude 
a 
perpetual 
motion. 
The 
attention 
takes 
in 
the 
two 
cases 
different 
directions 
and 
diffuses 
light 
over 
different 
sides 
of 
the 
question, 
which 
logically 
of 
course 
are 
necessarily 
connected. 


Surely 
that 
firm, 
logical 
setting 
of 
the 
thoughts 
noticeable 
in 
the 
great 
inquirers, 
Stevinus, 
Galileo, 
and 
the 
rest, 
which, 
consciously 
or 
instinctively, 
was 
supported 
by 
a 
fine 
feeling 
for 
the 
slightest 
contradictions, 
has 
no 
other 
purpose 
than 
to 
limit 
the 
bounds 
of 
thought 
and 
so 
exempt 
it 
from 
the 
possibility 
of 
error. 
In 
this, 
therefore, 
the 
logical 
root 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
is 
given, 
namely, 
in 
that 
universal 
conviction 
which 
existed 
even 
before 
the 
development 
of 
mechanics 
and 
co-operated 
in 
that 
development. 


It 
is 
perfectly 
natural 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
should 
have 
been 
first 
developed 
in 
the 
simple 
domain 
of 
pure 
mechanics. 
Towards 
the 
transference 
of 
that 
principle 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
general 
physics 
the 
idea 
contributed 
much 
that 
all 
physical 
phenomena 
are 
mechanical 
phenomena. 
But 
the 
foregoing 
discussion 
shows 
how 
little 
essential 
this 
notion 
is. 
The 
issue 
really 
involved 
is 
the 
recognition 
of 
a 
general 
interconnexion 
of 
nature. 
This 
once 
established, 
we 
see 
with 
Carnot 
that 
it 
is 
indifferent 
whether 
the 
mechanical 
laws 
are 
broken 
directly 
or 
circuitously. 


The 
principle 
of 
the 
excluded 
perpetual 
motion 
is 
very 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
modern 
principle 
of 
energy, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
it, 
for 
the 
latter 
is 
to 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
former 
only 
by 
means 
of 
a 
definite 
formal 
conception. 
As 
may 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
preceding 
exposition, 
the 
perpetual 
motion 
can 
be 
excluded 
without 
our 
employing 
or 
possessing 
the 
notion 
of 
work. 
The 
modern 
principle 
of 
energy 
results 
primarily 
from 
a 
substantial 
conception 
of 
work 
and 
of 
every 
change 
of 
physical 
condition 
which 
by 
being 
reversed 
produces 
work. 
The 
strong 
need 
of 
such 
a 
conception, 
which 
is 
by 
no 
means 
necessary, 
but 
in 
a 
formal 
sense 
is 
very 
convenient 
and 
lucid, 
is 
exhibited 
in 
the 
case 
of 
J. 
R. 
Mayer 
and 
Joule. 
It 
was 
before 
remarked 
that 
this 
conception 



was 
suggested 
to 
both 
inquirers 
by 
the 
observation 
that 
both 
the 
production 
of 
heat 
and 
the 
production 
of 
mechanical 
work 
were 
connected 
with 
an 
expenditure 
of 
substance. 
Mayer 
says: 
"Ex 
nihilo 
nil 
fit," 
and 
in 
another 
place, 
"The 
creation 
or 
destruction 
of 
a 
force 
(work) 
lies 
without 
the 
province 
of 
human 
activity." 
In 
Joule 
we 
find 
this 
passage: 
"It 
is 
manifestly 
absurd 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
powers 
with 
which 
God 
has 
endowed 
matter 
can 
be 
destroyed." 


Some 
writers 
have 
observed 
in 
such 
statements 
the 
attempt 
at 
a 
metaphysical 
establishment 
of 
the 
doctrine 
of 
energy. 
But 
we 
see 
in 
them 
simply 
the 
formal 
need 
of 
a 
simple, 
clear, 
and 
living 
grasp 
of 
the 
facts, 
which 
receives 
its 
development 
in 
practical 
and 
technical 
life, 
and 
which 
we 
carry 
over, 
as 
best 
we 
can, 
into 
the 
province 
of 
science. 
As 
a 
fact, 
Mayer 
writes 
to 
Griesinger: 
"If, 
finally, 
you 
ask 
me 
how 
I 
became 
involved 
in 
the 
whole 
affair, 
my 
answer 
is 
simply 
this: 
Engaged 
during 
a 
sea 
voyage 
almost 
exclusively 
with 
the 
study 
of 
physiology, 
I 
discovered 
the 
new 
theory 
for 
the 
sufficient 
reason 
that 
I 
vividly 
felt 
the 
need 
of 
it." 


The 
substantial 
conception 
of 
work 
(energy) 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
necessary 
one. 
And 
it 
is 
far 
from 
true 
that 
the 
problem 
is 
solved 
with 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
need 
of 
such 
a 
conception. 
Rather 
let 
us 
see 
how 
Mayer 
gradually 
endeavored 
to 
satisfy 
that 
need. 
He 
first 
regards 
quantity 
of 
motion, 
or 
momentum, 
mv, 
as 
the 
equivalent 
of 
work, 
and 
did 
not 
light, 
until 
later, 
on 
the 
notion 
of 
living 
force 
(mv2/2). 
In 
the 
province 
of 
electricity 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
assign 
the 
expression 
which 
is 
the 
equivalent 
of 
work. 
This 
was 
done 
later 
by 
Helmholtz. 
The 
formal 
need, 
therefore, 
is 
first 
present, 
and 
our 
conception 
of 
nature 
is 
subsequently 
gradually 
adapted 
to 
it. 


The 
laying 
bare 
of 
the 
experimental, 
logical, 
and 
formal 
root 
of 
the 
present 
principle 
of 
energy 
will 
perhaps 
contribute 
much 
to 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
mysticism 
which 
still 
clings 
to 
this 
principle. 
With 
respect 
to 
our 
formal 
need 
of 
a 
very 
simple, 
palpable, 
substantial 
conception 
of 
the 
processes 
in 
our 
environment, 
it 
remains 
an 
open 
question 
how 
far 
nature 
corresponds 
to 
that 
need, 
or 
how 
far 
we 
can 
satisfy 
it. 
In 
one 
phase 
of 
the 
preceding 
discussions 
it 
would 
seem 
as 
if 
the 
substantial 
notion 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
energy, 
like 
Black's 
material 
conception 
of 
heat, 
has 
its 
natural 
limits 
in 
facts, 
beyond 
which 
it 
can 
only 
be 
artificially 
adhered 
to. 



THE 
ECONOMICAL 
NATURE 
OF 
PHYSICAL 
INQUIRY. 
[60] 


When 
the 
human 
mind, 
with 
its 
limited 
powers, 
attempts 
to 
mirror 
in 
itself 
the 
rich 
life 
of 
the 
world, 
of 
which 
it 
is 
itself 
only 
a 
small 
part, 
and 
which 
it 
can 
never 
hope 
to 
exhaust, 
it 
has 
every 
reason 
for 
proceeding 
economically. 
Hence 
that 
tendency, 
expressed 
in 
the 
philosophy 
of 
all 
times, 
to 
compass 
by 
a 
few 
organic 
thoughts 
the 
fundamental 
features 
of 
reality. 
"Life 
understands 
not 
death, 
nor 
death 
life." 
So 
spake 
an 
old 
Chinese 
philosopher. 
Yet 
in 
his 
unceasing 
desire 
to 
diminish 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
incomprehensible, 
man 
has 
always 
been 
engaged 
in 
attempts 
to 
understand 
death 
by 
life 
and 
life 
by 
death. 


Among 
the 
ancient 
civilised 
peoples, 
nature 
was 
filled 
with 
demons 
and 
spirits 
having 
the 
feelings 
and 
desires 
of 
men. 
In 
all 
essential 
features, 
this 
animistic 
view 
of 
nature, 
as 
Tylor 
[61] 
has 
aptly 
termed 
it, 
is 
shared 
in 
common 
by 
the 
fetish-worshipper 
of 
modern 
Africa 
and 
the 
most 
advanced 
nations 
of 
antiquity. 
As 
a 
theory 
of 
the 
world 
it 
has 
never 
completely 
disappeared. 
The 
monotheism 
of 
the 
Christians 
never 
fully 
overcame 
it, 
no 
more 
than 
did 
that 
of 
the 
Jews. 
In 
the 
belief 
in 
witchcraft 
and 
in 
the 
superstitions 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
and 
seventeenth 
centuries, 
the 
centuries 
of 
the 
rise 
of 
natural 
science, 
it 
assumed 
frightful 
pathological 
dimensions. 
Whilst 
Stevinus, 
Kepler, 
and 
Galileo 
were 
slowly 
rearing 
the 
fabric 
of 
modern 
physical 
science, 
a 
cruel 
and 
relentless 
war 
was 
waged 
with 
firebrand 
and 
rack 
against 
the 
devils 
that 
glowered 
from 
every 
corner. 
To-day 
even, 
apart 
from 
all 
survivals 
of 
that 
period, 
apart 
from 
the 
traces 
of 
fetishism 
which 
still 
inhere 
in 
our 
physical 
concepts, 
[62] 
those 
very 
ideas 
still 
covertly 
lurk 
in 
the 
practices 
of 
modern 
spiritualism. 


By 
the 
side 
of 
this 
animistic 
conception 
of 
the 
world, 
we 
meet 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
in 
different 
forms, 
from 
Democritus 
to 
the 
present 
day, 
another 
view, 
which 
likewise 
claims 
exclusive 
competency 
to 
comprehend 
the 
universe. 
This 
view 
may 
be 
characterised 
as 
the 
physico-mechanical 
view 
of 
the 
world. 
To-day, 
that 
view 
holds, 
indisputably, 
the 
first 
place 
in 
the 
thoughts 
of 
men, 



and 
determines 
the 
ideals 
and 
the 
character 
of 
our 
times. 
The 
coming 
of 
the 
mind 
of 
man 
into 
the 
full 
consciousness 
of 
its 
powers, 
in 
the 
eighteenth 
century, 
was 
a 
period 
of 
genuine 
disillusionment. 
It 
produced 
the 
splendid 
precedent 
of 
a 
life 
really 
worthy 
of 
man, 
competent 
to 
overcome 
the 
old 
barbarism 
in 
the 
practical 
fields 
of 
life; 
it 
created 
the 
Critique 
of 
Pure 
Reason, 
which 
banished 
into 
the 
realm 
of 
shadows 
the 
sham-ideas 
of 
the 
old 
metaphysics; 
it 
pressed 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
mechanical 
philosophy 
the 
reins 
which 
it 
now 
holds. 


The 
oft-quoted 
words 
of 
the 
great 
Laplace, 
[63] 
which 
I 
will 
now 
give, 
have 
the 
ring 
of 
a 
jubilant 
toast 
to 
the 
scientific 
achievements 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century: 
"A 
mind 
to 
which 
were 
given 
for 
a 
single 
instant 
all 
the 
forces 
of 
nature 
and 
the 
mutual 
positions 
of 
all 
its 
masses, 
if 
it 
were 
otherwise 
powerful 
enough 
to 
subject 
these 
problems 
to 
analysis, 
could 
grasp, 
with 
a 
single 
formula, 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
largest 
masses 
as 
well 
as 
of 
the 
smallest 
atoms; 
nothing 
would 
be 
uncertain 
for 
it; 
the 
future 
and 
the 
past 
would 
lie 
revealed 
before 
its 
eyes." 
In 
writing 
these 
words, 
Laplace, 
as 
we 
know, 
had 
also 
in 
mind 
the 
atoms 
of 
the 
brain. 
That 
idea 
has 
been 
expressed 
more 
forcibly 
still 
by 
some 
of 
his 
followers, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
too 
much 
to 
say 
that 
Laplace's 
ideal 
is 
substantially 
that 
of 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
modern 
scientists. 


Gladly 
do 
we 
accord 
to 
the 
creator 
of 
the 
Mécanique 
céleste 
the 
sense 
of 
lofty 
pleasure 
awakened 
in 
him 
by 
the 
great 
success 
of 
the 
Enlightenment, 
to 
which 
we 
too 
owe 
our 
intellectual 
freedom. 
But 
to-day, 
with 
minds 
undisturbed 
and 
before 
new 
tasks, 
it 
becomes 
physical 
science 
to 
secure 
itself 
against 
self-deception 
by 
a 
careful 
study 
of 
its 
character, 
so 
that 
it 
can 
pursue 
with 
greater 
sureness 
its 
true 
objects. 
If 
I 
step, 
therefore, 
beyond 
the 
narrow 
precincts 
of 
my 
specialty 
in 
this 
discussion, 
to 
trespass 
on 
friendly 
neighboring 
domains, 
I 
may 
plead 
in 
my 
excuse 
that 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
knowledge 
is 
common 
to 
all 
domains 
of 
research, 
and 
that 
fixed, 
sharp 
lines 
of 
demarcation 
cannot 
be 
drawn. 


The 
belief 
in 
occult 
magic 
powers 
of 
nature 
has 
gradually 
died 
away, 
but 
in 
its 
place 
a 
new 
belief 
has 
arisen, 
the 
belief 
in 
the 
magical 
power 
of 
science. 
Science 
throws 
her 
treasures, 
not 
like 
a 
capricious 
fairy 
into 
the 
laps 
of 
a 
favored 
few, 
but 
into 
the 
laps 
of 
all 
humanity, 
with 
a 
lavish 
extravagance 
that 
no 
legend 
ever 
dreamt 
of! 
Not 
without 
apparent 
justice, 
therefore, 
do 
her 



distant 
admirers 
impute 
to 
her 
the 
power 
of 
opening 
up 
unfathomable 
abysses 
of 
nature, 
to 
which 
the 
senses 
cannot 
penetrate. 
Yet 
she 
who 
came 
to 
bring 
light 
into 
the 
world, 
can 
well 
dispense 
with 
the 
darkness 
of 
mystery, 
and 
with 
pompous 
show, 
which 
she 
needs 
neither 
for 
the 
justification 
of 
her 
aims 
nor 
for 
the 
adornment 
of 
her 
plain 
achievements. 


The 
homely 
beginnings 
of 
science 
will 
best 
reveal 
to 
us 
its 
simple, 
unchangeable 
character. 
Man 
acquires 
his 
first 
knowledge 
of 
nature 
half-
consciously 
and 
automatically, 
from 
an 
instinctive 
habit 
of 
mimicking 
and 
forecasting 
facts 
in 
thought, 
of 
supplementing 
sluggish 
experience 
with 
the 
swift 
wings 
of 
thought, 
at 
first 
only 
for 
his 
material 
welfare. 
When 
he 
hears 
a 
noise 
in 
the 
underbrush 
he 
constructs 
there, 
just 
as 
the 
animal 
does, 
the 
enemy 
which 
he 
fears; 
when 
he 
sees 
a 
certain 
rind 
he 
forms 
mentally 
the 
image 
of 
the 
fruit 
which 
he 
is 
in 
search 
of; 
just 
as 
we 
mentally 
associate 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
matter 
with 
a 
certain 
line 
in 
the 
spectrum 
or 
an 
electric 
spark 
with 
the 
friction 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
glass. 
A 
knowledge 
of 
causality 
in 
this 
form 
certainly 
reaches 
far 
below 
the 
level 
of 
Schopenhauer's 
pet 
dog, 
to 
whom 
it 
was 
ascribed. 
It 
probably 
exists 
in 
the 
whole 
animal 
world, 
and 
confirms 
that 
great 
thinker's 
statement 
regarding 
the 
will 
which 
created 
the 
intellect 
for 
its 
purposes. 
These 
primitive 
psychical 
functions 
are 
rooted 
in 
the 
economy 
of 
our 
organism 
not 
less 
firmly 
than 
are 
motion 
and 
digestion. 
Who 
would 
deny 
that 
we 
feel 
in 
them, 
too, 
the 
elemental 
power 
of 
a 
long 
practised 
logical 
and 
physiological 
activity, 
bequeathed 
to 
us 
as 
an 
heirloom 
from 
our 
forefathers? 


Such 
primitive 
acts 
of 
knowledge 
constitute 
to-day 
the 
solidest 
foundation 
of 
scientific 
thought. 
Our 
instinctive 
knowledge, 
as 
we 
shall 
briefly 
call 
it, 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
conviction 
that 
we 
have 
consciously 
and 
intentionally 
contributed 
nothing 
to 
its 
formation, 
confronts 
us 
with 
an 
authority 
and 
logical 
power 
which 
consciously 
acquired 
knowledge 
even 
from 
familiar 
sources 
and 
of 
easily 
tested 
fallibility 
can 
never 
possess. 
All 
so-called 
axioms 
are 
such 
instinctive 
knowledge. 
Not 
consciously 
gained 
knowledge 
alone, 
but 
powerful 
intellectual 
instinct, 
joined 
with 
vast 
conceptive 
powers, 
constitute 
the 
great 
inquirer. 
The 
greatest 
advances 
of 
science 
have 
always 
consisted 
in 
some 
successful 
formulation, 
in 
clear, 
abstract, 
and 
communicable 
terms, 
of 
what 
was 
instinctively 
known 
long 
before, 
and 
of 
thus 
making 
it 
the 
permanent 
property 
of 
humanity. 
By 
Newton's 
principle 
of 
the 
equality 
of 
pressure 
and 
counterpressure, 
whose 
truth 
all 
before 
him 
had 
felt, 
but 
which 



no 
predecessor 
had 
abstractly 
formulated, 
mechanics 
was 
placed 
by 
a 
single 
stroke 
on 
a 
higher 
level. 
Our 
statement 
might 
also 
be 
historically 
justified 
by 
examples 
from 
the 
scientific 
labors 
of 
Stevinus, 
S. 
Carnot, 
Faraday, 
J. 
R. 
Mayer, 
and 
others. 


All 
this, 
however, 
is 
merely 
the 
soil 
from 
which 
science 
starts. 
The 
first 
real 
beginnings 
of 
science 
appear 
in 
society, 
particularly 
in 
the 
manual 
arts, 
where 
the 
necessity 
for 
the 
communication 
of 
experience 
arises. 
Here, 
where 
some 
new 
discovery 
is 
to 
be 
described 
and 
related, 
the 
compulsion 
is 
first 
felt 
of 
clearly 
defining 
in 
consciousness 
the 
important 
and 
essential 
features 
of 
that 
discovery, 
as 
many 
writers 
can 
testify. 
The 
aim 
of 
instruction 
is 
simply 
the 
saving 
of 
experience; 
the 
labor 
of 
one 
man 
is 
made 
to 
take 
the 
place 
of 
that 
of 
another. 


The 
most 
wonderful 
economy 
of 
communication 
is 
found 
in 
language. 
Words 
are 
comparable 
to 
type, 
which 
spare 
the 
repetition 
of 
written 
signs 
and 
thus 
serve 
a 
multitude 
of 
purposes; 
or 
to 
the 
few 
sounds 
of 
which 
our 
numberless 
different 
words 
are 
composed. 
Language, 
with 
its 
helpmate, 
conceptual 
thought, 
by 
fixing 
the 
essential 
and 
rejecting 
the 
unessential, 
constructs 
its 
rigid 
pictures 
of 
the 
fluid 
world 
on 
the 
plan 
of 
a 
mosaic, 
at 
a 
sacrifice 
of 
exactness 
and 
fidelity 
but 
with 
a 
saving 
of 
tools 
and 
labor. 
Like 
a 
piano-
player 
with 
previously 
prepared 
sounds, 
a 
speaker 
excites 
in 
his 
listener 
thoughts 
previously 
prepared, 
but 
fitting 
many 
cases, 
which 
respond 
to 
the 
speaker's 
summons 
with 
alacrity 
and 
little 
effort. 


The 
principles 
which 
a 
prominent 
political 
economist, 
E. 
Hermann, 
[64] 
has 
formulated 
for 
the 
economy 
of 
the 
industrial 
arts, 
are 
also 
applicable 
to 
the 
ideas 
of 
common 
life 
and 
of 
science. 
The 
economy 
of 
language 
is 
augmented, 
of 
course, 
in 
the 
terminology 
of 
science. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
economy 
of 
written 
intercourse 
there 
is 
scarcely 
a 
doubt 
that 
science 
itself 
will 
realise 
that 
grand 
old 
dream 
of 
the 
philosophers 
of 
a 
Universal 
Real 
Character. 
That 
time 
is 
not 
far 
distant. 
Our 
numeral 
characters, 
the 
symbols 
of 
mathematical 
analysis, 
chemical 
symbols, 
and 
musical 
notes, 
which 
might 
easily 
be 
supplemented 
by 
a 
system 
of 
color-signs, 
together 
with 
some 
phonetic 
alphabets 
now 
in 
use, 
are 
all 
beginnings 
in 
this 
direction. 
The 
logical 
extension 
of 
what 
we 
have, 
joined 
with 
a 
use 
of 
the 
ideas 
which 
the 
Chinese 
ideography 
furnishes 
us, 
will 
render 
the 
special 
invention 
and 
promulgation 



of 
a 
Universal 
Character 
wholly 
superfluous. 


The 
communication 
of 
scientific 
knowledge 
always 
involves 
description, 
that 
is, 
a 
mimetic 
reproduction 
of 
facts 
in 
thought, 
the 
object 
of 
which 
is 
to 
replace 
and 
save 
the 
trouble 
of 
new 
experience. 
Again, 
to 
save 
the 
labor 
of 
instruction 
and 
of 
acquisition, 
concise, 
abridged 
description 
is 
sought. 
This 
is 
really 
all 
that 
natural 
laws 
are. 
Knowing 
the 
value 
of 
the 
acceleration 
of 
gravity, 
and 
Galileo's 
laws 
of 
descent, 
we 
possess 
simple 
and 
compendious 
directions 
for 
reproducing 
in 
thought 
all 
possible 
motions 
of 
falling 
bodies. 
A 
formula 
of 
this 
kind 
is 
a 
complete 
substitute 
for 
a 
full 
table 
of 
motions 
of 
descent, 
because 
by 
means 
of 
the 
formula 
the 
data 
of 
such 
a 
table 
can 
be 
easily 
constructed 
at 
a 
moment's 
notice 
without 
the 
least 
burdening 
of 
the 
memory. 


No 
human 
mind 
could 
comprehend 
all 
the 
individual 
cases 
of 
refraction. 
But 
knowing 
the 
index 
of 
refraction 
for 
the 
two 
media 
presented, 
and 
the 
familiar 
law 
of 
the 
sines, 
we 
can 
easily 
reproduce 
or 
fill 
out 
in 
thought 
every 
conceivable 
case 
of 
refraction. 
The 
advantage 
here 
consists 
in 
the 
disburdening 
of 
the 
memory; 
an 
end 
immensely 
furthered 
by 
the 
written 
preservation 
of 
the 
natural 
constants. 
More 
than 
this 
comprehensive 
and 
condensed 
report 
about 
facts 
is 
not 
contained 
in 
a 
natural 
law 
of 
this 
sort. 
In 
reality, 
the 
law 
always 
contains 
less 
than 
the 
fact 
itself, 
because 
it 
does 
not 
reproduce 
the 
fact 
as 
a 
whole 
but 
only 
in 
that 
aspect 
of 
it 
which 
is 
important 
for 
us, 
the 
rest 
being 
either 
intentionally 
or 
from 
necessity 
omitted. 
Natural 
laws 
may 
be 
likened 
to 
intellectual 
type 
of 
a 
higher 
order, 
partly 
movable, 
partly 
stereotyped, 
which 
last 
on 
new 
editions 
of 
experience 
may 
become 
downright 
impediments. 


When 
we 
look 
over 
a 
province 
of 
facts 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
it 
appears 
to 
us 
diversified, 
irregular, 
confused, 
full 
of 
contradictions. 
We 
first 
succeed 
in 
grasping 
only 
single 
facts, 
unrelated 
with 
the 
others. 
The 
province, 
as 
we 
are 
wont 
to 
say, 
is 
not 
clear. 
By 
and 
by 
we 
discover 
the 
simple, 
permanent 
elements 
of 
the 
mosaic, 
out 
of 
which 
we 
can 
mentally 
construct 
the 
whole 
province. 
When 
we 
have 
reached 
a 
point 
where 
we 
can 
discover 
everywhere 
the 
same 
facts, 
we 
no 
longer 
feel 
lost 
in 
this 
province; 
we 
comprehend 
it 
without 
effort; 
it 
is 
explained 
for 
us. 


Let 
me 
illustrate 
this 
by 
an 
example. 
As 
soon 
as 
we 
have 
grasped 
the 
fact 
of 



the 
rectilinear 
propagation 
of 
light, 
the 
regular 
course 
of 
our 
thoughts 
stumbles 
at 
the 
phenomena 
of 
refraction 
and 
diffraction. 
As 
soon 
as 
we 
have 
cleared 
matters 
up 
by 
our 
index 
of 
refraction 
we 
discover 
that 
a 
special 
index 
is 
necessary 
for 
each 
color. 
Soon 
after 
we 
have 
accustomed 
ourselves 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
light 
added 
to 
light 
increases 
its 
intensity, 
we 
suddenly 
come 
across 
a 
case 
of 
total 
darkness 
produced 
by 
this 
cause. 
Ultimately, 
however, 
we 
see 
everywhere 
in 
the 
overwhelming 
multifariousness 
of 
optical 
phenomena 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
spatial 
and 
temporal 
periodicity 
of 
light, 
with 
its 
velocity 
of 
propagation 
dependent 
on 
the 
medium 
and 
the 
period. 
This 
tendency 
of 
obtaining 
a 
survey 
of 
a 
given 
province 
with 
the 
least 
expenditure 
of 
thought, 
and 
of 
representing 
all 
its 
facts 
by 
some 
one 
single 
mental 
process, 
may 
be 
justly 
termed 
an 
economical 
one. 


The 
greatest 
perfection 
of 
mental 
economy 
is 
attained 
in 
that 
science 
which 
has 
reached 
the 
highest 
formal 
development, 
and 
which 
is 
widely 
employed 
in 
physical 
inquiry, 
namely, 
in 
mathematics. 
Strange 
as 
it 
may 
sound, 
the 
power 
of 
mathematics 
rests 
upon 
its 
evasion 
of 
all 
unnecessary 
thought 
and 
on 
its 
wonderful 
saving 
of 
mental 
operations. 
Even 
those 
arrangement-signs 
which 
we 
call 
numbers 
are 
a 
system 
of 
marvellous 
simplicity 
and 
economy. 
When 
we 
employ 
the 
multiplication-table 
in 
multiplying 
numbers 
of 
several 
places, 
and 
so 
use 
the 
results 
of 
old 
operations 
of 
counting 
instead 
of 
performing 
the 
whole 
of 
each 
operation 
anew; 
when 
we 
consult 
our 
table 
of 
logarithms, 
replacing 
and 
saving 
thus 
new 
calculations 
by 
old 
ones 
already 
performed; 
when 
we 
employ 
determinants 
instead 
of 
always 
beginning 
afresh 
the 
solution 
of 
a 
system 
of 
equations; 
when 
we 
resolve 
new 
integral 
expressions 
into 
familiar 
old 
integrals; 
we 
see 
in 
this 
simply 
a 
feeble 
reflexion 
of 
the 
intellectual 
activity 
of 
a 
Lagrange 
or 
a 
Cauchy, 
who, 
with 
the 
keen 
discernment 
of 
a 
great 
military 
commander, 
substituted 
for 
new 
operations 
whole 
hosts 
of 
old 
ones. 
No 
one 
will 
dispute 
me 
when 
I 
say 
that 
the 
most 
elementary 
as 
well 
as 
the 
highest 
mathematics 
are 
economically-
ordered 
experiences 
of 
counting, 
put 
in 
forms 
ready 
for 
use. 


In 
algebra 
we 
perform, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
all 
numerical 
operations 
which 
are 
identical 
in 
form 
once 
for 
all, 
so 
that 
only 
a 
remnant 
of 
work 
is 
left 
for 
the 
individual 
case. 
The 
use 
of 
the 
signs 
of 
algebra 
and 
analysis, 
which 
are 
merely 
symbols 
of 
operations 
to 
be 
performed, 
is 
due 
to 
the 
observation 
that 
we 
can 
materially 
disburden 
the 
mind 
in 
this 
way 
and 
spare 
its 
powers 
for 



more 
important 
and 
more 
difficult 
duties, 
by 
imposing 
all 
mechanical 
operations 
upon 
the 
hand. 
One 
result 
of 
this 
method, 
which 
attests 
its 
economical 
character, 
is 
the 
construction 
of 
calculating 
machines. 
The 
mathematician 
Babbage, 
the 
inventor 
of 
the 
difference-engine, 
was 
probably 
the 
first 
who 
clearly 
perceived 
this 
fact, 
and 
he 
touched 
upon 
it, 
although 
only 
cursorily, 
in 
his 
work, 
The 
Economy 
of 
Manufactures 
and 
Machinery. 


The 
student 
of 
mathematics 
often 
finds 
it 
hard 
to 
throw 
off 
the 
uncomfortable 
feeling 
that 
his 
science, 
in 
the 
person 
of 
his 
pencil, 
surpasses 
him 
in 
intelligence,—an 
impression 
which 
the 
great 
Euler 
confessed 
he 
often 
could 
not 
get 
rid 
of. 
This 
feeling 
finds 
a 
sort 
of 
justification 
when 
we 
reflect 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
ideas 
we 
deal 
with 
were 
conceived 
by 
others, 
often 
centuries 
ago. 
In 
great 
measure 
it 
is 
really 
the 
intelligence 
of 
other 
people 
that 
confronts 
us 
in 
science. 
The 
moment 
we 
look 
at 
matters 
in 
this 
light, 
the 
uncanniness 
and 
magical 
character 
of 
our 
impressions 
cease, 
especially 
when 
we 
remember 
that 
we 
can 
think 
over 
again 
at 
will 
any 
one 
of 
those 
alien 
thoughts. 


Physics 
is 
experience, 
arranged 
in 
economical 
order. 
By 
this 
order 
not 
only 
is 
a 
broad 
and 
comprehensive 
view 
of 
what 
we 
have 
rendered 
possible, 
but 
also 
the 
defects 
and 
the 
needful 
alterations 
are 
made 
manifest, 
exactly 
as 
in 
a 
well-
kept 
household. 
Physics 
shares 
with 
mathematics 
the 
advantages 
of 
succinct 
description 
and 
of 
brief, 
compendious 
definition, 
which 
precludes 
confusion, 
even 
in 
ideas 
where, 
with 
no 
apparent 
burdening 
of 
the 
brain, 
hosts 
of 
others 
are 
contained. 
Of 
these 
ideas 
the 
rich 
contents 
can 
be 
produced 
at 
any 
moment 
and 
displayed 
in 
their 
full 
perceptual 
light. 
Think 
of 
the 
swarm 
of 
well-ordered 
notions 
pent 
up 
in 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
potential. 
Is 
it 
wonderful 
that 
ideas 
containing 
so 
much 
finished 
labor 
should 
be 
easy 
to 
work 
with? 


Our 
first 
knowledge, 
thus, 
is 
a 
product 
of 
the 
economy 
of 
self-preservation. 
By 
communication, 
the 
experience 
of 
many 
persons, 
individually 
acquired 
at 
first, 
is 
collected 
in 
one. 
The 
communication 
of 
knowledge 
and 
the 
necessity 
which 
every 
one 
feels 
of 
managing 
his 
stock 
of 
experience 
with 
the 
least 
expenditure 
of 
thought, 
compel 
us 
to 
put 
our 
knowledge 
in 
economical 
forms. 
But 
here 
we 
have 
a 
clue 
which 
strips 
science 
of 
all 
its 
mystery, 
and 
shows 
us 
what 
its 
power 
really 
is. 
With 
respect 
to 
specific 
results 
it 
yields 
us 
nothing 
that 
we 
could 
not 
reach 
in 
a 
sufficiently 
long 
time 
without 
methods. 
There 
is 



no 
problem 
in 
all 
mathematics 
that 
cannot 
be 
solved 
by 
direct 
counting. 
But 
with 
the 
present 
implements 
of 
mathematics 
many 
operations 
of 
counting 
can 
be 
performed 
in 
a 
few 
minutes 
which 
without 
mathematical 
methods 
would 
take 
a 
lifetime. 
Just 
as 
a 
single 
human 
being, 
restricted 
wholly 
to 
the 
fruits 
of 
his 
own 
labor, 
could 
never 
amass 
a 
fortune, 
but 
on 
the 
contrary 
the 
accumulation 
of 
the 
labor 
of 
many 
men 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
one 
is 
the 
foundation 
of 
wealth 
and 
power, 
so, 
also, 
no 
knowledge 
worthy 
of 
the 
name 
can 
be 
gathered 
up 
in 
a 
single 
human 
mind 
limited 
to 
the 
span 
of 
a 
human 
life 
and 
gifted 
only 
with 
finite 
powers, 
except 
by 
the 
most 
exquisite 
economy 
of 
thought 
and 
by 
the 
careful 
amassment 
of 
the 
economically 
ordered 
experience 
of 
thousands 
of 
co-workers. 
What 
strikes 
us 
here 
as 
the 
fruits 
of 
sorcery 
are 
simply 
the 
rewards 
of 
excellent 
housekeeping, 
as 
are 
the 
like 
results 
in 
civil 
life. 
But 
the 
business 
of 
science 
has 
this 
advantage 
over 
every 
other 
enterprise, 
that 
from 
its 
amassment 
of 
wealth 
no 
one 
suffers 
the 
least 
loss. 
This, 
too, 
is 
its 
blessing, 
its 
freeing 
and 
saving 
power. 


The 
recognition 
of 
the 
economical 
character 
of 
science 
will 
now 
help 
us, 
perhaps, 
to 
understand 
better 
certain 
physical 
notions. 


Those 
elements 
of 
an 
event 
which 
we 
call 
"cause 
and 
effect" 
are 
certain 
salient 
features 
of 
it, 
which 
are 
important 
for 
its 
mental 
reproduction. 
Their 
importance 
wanes 
and 
the 
attention 
is 
transferred 
to 
fresh 
characters 
the 
moment 
the 
event 
or 
experience 
in 
question 
becomes 
familiar. 
If 
the 
connexion 
of 
such 
features 
strikes 
us 
as 
a 
necessary 
one, 
it 
is 
simply 
because 
the 
interpolation 
of 
certain 
intermediate 
links 
with 
which 
we 
are 
very 
familiar, 
and 
which 
possess, 
therefore, 
higher 
authority 
for 
us, 
is 
often 
attended 
with 
success 
in 
our 
explanations. 
That 
ready 
experience 
fixed 
in 
the 
mosaic 
of 
the 
mind 
with 
which 
we 
meet 
new 
events, 
Kant 
calls 
an 
innate 
concept 
of 
the 
understanding 
(Verstandesbegriff). 


The 
grandest 
principles 
of 
physics, 
resolved 
into 
their 
elements, 
differ 
in 
no 
wise 
from 
the 
descriptive 
principles 
of 
the 
natural 
historian. 
The 
question, 
"Why?" 
which 
is 
always 
appropriate 
where 
the 
explanation 
of 
a 
contradiction 
is 
concerned, 
like 
all 
proper 
habitudes 
of 
thought, 
can 
overreach 
itself 
and 
be 
asked 
where 
nothing 
remains 
to 
be 
understood. 
Suppose 
we 
were 
to 
attribute 
to 
nature 
the 
property 
of 
producing 
like 
effects 
in 
like 
circumstances; 
just 
these 
like 
circumstances 
we 
should 
not 
know 
how 
to 
find. 
Nature 
exists 
once 



only. 
Our 
schematic 
mental 
imitation 
alone 
produces 
like 
events. 
Only 
in 
the 
mind, 
therefore, 
does 
the 
mutual 
dependence 
of 
certain 
features 
exist. 


All 
our 
efforts 
to 
mirror 
the 
world 
in 
thought 
would 
be 
futile 
if 
we 
found 
nothing 
permanent 
in 
the 
varied 
changes 
of 
things. 
It 
is 
this 
that 
impels 
us 
to 
form 
the 
notion 
of 
substance, 
the 
source 
of 
which 
is 
not 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
modern 
ideas 
relative 
to 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy. 
The 
history 
of 
physics 
furnishes 
numerous 
examples 
of 
this 
impulse 
in 
almost 
all 
fields, 
and 
pretty 
examples 
of 
it 
may 
be 
traced 
back 
to 
the 
nursery. 
"Where 
does 
the 
light 
go 
to 
when 
it 
is 
put 
out?" 
asks 
the 
child. 
The 
sudden 
shrivelling 
up 
of 
a 
hydrogen 
balloon 
is 
inexplicable 
to 
a 
child; 
it 
looks 
everywhere 
for 
the 
large 
body 
which 
was 
just 
there 
but 
is 
now 
gone. 


Where 
does 
heat 
come 
from? 
Where 
does 
heat 
go 
to? 
Such 
childish 
questions 
in 
the 
mouths 
of 
mature 
men 
shape 
the 
character 
of 
a 
century. 


In 
mentally 
separating 
a 
body 
from 
the 
changeable 
environment 
in 
which 
it 
moves, 
what 
we 
really 
do 
is 
to 
extricate 
a 
group 
of 
sensations 
on 
which 
our 
thoughts 
are 
fastened 
and 
which 
is 
of 
relatively 
greater 
stability 
than 
the 
others, 
from 
the 
stream 
of 
all 
our 
sensations. 
Absolutely 
unalterable 
this 
group 
is 
not. 
Now 
this, 
now 
that 
member 
of 
it 
appears 
and 
disappears, 
or 
is 
altered. 
In 
its 
full 
identity 
it 
never 
recurs. 
Yet 
the 
sum 
of 
its 
constant 
elements 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
sum 
of 
its 
changeable 
ones, 
especially 
if 
we 
consider 
the 
continuous 
character 
of 
the 
transition, 
is 
always 
so 
great 
that 
for 
the 
purpose 
in 
hand 
the 
former 
usually 
appear 
sufficient 
to 
determine 
the 
body's 
identity. 
But 
because 
we 
can 
separate 
from 
the 
group 
every 
single 
member 
without 
the 
body's 
ceasing 
to 
be 
for 
us 
the 
same, 
we 
are 
easily 
led 
to 
believe 
that 
after 
abstracting 
all 
the 
members 
something 
additional 
would 
remain. 
It 
thus 
comes 
to 
pass 
that 
we 
form 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
substance 
distinct 
from 
its 
attributes, 
of 
a 
thing-in-itself, 
whilst 
our 
sensations 
are 
regarded 
merely 
as 
symbols 
or 
indications 
of 
the 
properties 
of 
this 
thing-in-itself. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
much 
better 
to 
say 
that 
bodies 
or 
things 
are 
compendious 
mental 
symbols 
for 
groups 
of 
sensations—symbols 
that 
do 
not 
exist 
outside 
of 
thought. 
Thus, 
the 
merchant 
regards 
the 
labels 
of 
his 
boxes 
merely 
as 
indexes 
of 
their 
contents, 
and 
not 
the 
contrary. 
He 
invests 
their 
contents, 
not 
their 
labels, 
with 
real 
value. 
The 
same 
economy 
which 
induces 
us 
to 
analyse 
a 
group 
and 
to 
establish 
special 
signs 
for 
its 
component 
parts, 
parts 
which 
also 
go 
to 
make 



up 
other 
groups, 
may 
likewise 
induce 
us 
to 
mark 
out 
by 
some 
single 
symbol 
a 
whole 
group. 


On 
the 
old 
Egyptian 
monuments 
we 
see 
objects 
represented 
which 
do 
not 
reproduce 
a 
single 
visual 
impression, 
but 
are 
composed 
of 
various 
impressions. 
The 
heads 
and 
the 
legs 
of 
the 
figures 
appear 
in 
profile, 
the 
headdress 
and 
the 
breast 
are 
seen 
from 
the 
front, 
and 
so 
on. 
We 
have 
here, 
so 
to 
speak, 
a 
mean 
view 
of 
the 
objects, 
in 
forming 
which 
the 
sculptor 
has 
retained 
what 
he 
deemed 
essential, 
and 
neglected 
what 
he 
thought 
indifferent. 
We 
have 
living 
exemplifications 
of 
the 
processes 
put 
into 
stone 
on 
the 
walls 
of 
these 
old 
temples, 
in 
the 
drawings 
of 
our 
children, 
and 
we 
also 
observe 
a 
faithful 
analogue 
of 
them 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
ideas 
in 
our 
own 
minds. 
Only 
in 
virtue 
of 
some 
such 
facility 
of 
view 
as 
that 
indicated, 
are 
we 
allowed 
to 
speak 
of 
a 
body. 
When 
we 
speak 
of 
a 
cube 
with 
trimmed 
corners—a 
figure 
which 
is 
not 
a 
cube—we 
do 
so 
from 
a 
natural 
instinct 
of 
economy, 
which 
prefers 
to 
add 
to 
an 
old 
familiar 
conception 
a 
correction 
instead 
of 
forming 
an 
entirely 
new 
one. 
This 
is 
the 
process 
of 
all 
judgment. 


The 
crude 
notion 
of 
"body" 
can 
no 
more 
stand 
the 
test 
of 
analysis 
than 
can 
the 
art 
of 
the 
Egyptians 
or 
that 
of 
our 
little 
children. 
The 
physicist 
who 
sees 
a 
body 
flexed, 
stretched, 
melted, 
and 
vaporised, 
cuts 
up 
this 
body 
into 
smaller 
permanent 
parts; 
the 
chemist 
splits 
it 
up 
into 
elements. 
Yet 
even 
an 
element 
is 
not 
unalterable. 
Take 
sodium. 
When 
warmed, 
the 
white, 
silvery 
mass 
becomes 
a 
liquid, 
which, 
when 
the 
heat 
is 
increased 
and 
the 
air 
shut 
out, 
is 
transformed 
into 
a 
violet 
vapor, 
and 
on 
the 
heat 
being 
still 
more 
increased 
glows 
with 
a 
yellow 
light. 
If 
the 
name 
sodium 
is 
still 
retained, 
it 
is 
because 
of 
the 
continuous 
character 
of 
the 
transitions 
and 
from 
a 
necessary 
instinct 
of 
economy. 
By 
condensing 
the 
vapor, 
the 
white 
metal 
may 
be 
made 
to 
reappear. 
Indeed, 
even 
after 
the 
metal 
is 
thrown 
into 
water 
and 
has 
passed 
into 
sodium 
hydroxide, 
the 
vanished 
properties 
may 
by 
skilful 
treatment 
still 
be 
made 
to 
appear; 
just 
as 
a 
moving 
body 
which 
has 
passed 
behind 
a 
column 
and 
is 
lost 
to 
view 
for 
a 
moment 
may 
make 
its 
appearance 
after 
a 
time. 
It 
is 
unquestionably 
very 
convenient 
always 
to 
have 
ready 
the 
name 
and 
thought 
for 
a 
group 
of 
properties 
wherever 
that 
group 
by 
any 
possibility 
can 
appear. 
But 
more 
than 
a 
compendious 
economical 
symbol 
for 
these 
phenomena, 
that 
name 
and 
thought 
is 
not. 
It 
would 
be 
a 
mere 
empty 
word 
for 
one 
in 
whom 
it 
did 
not 
awaken 
a 
large 
group 
of 
well-ordered 
sense-impressions. 
And 
the 



same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
molecules 
and 
atoms 
into 
which 
the 
chemical 
element 
is 
still 
further 
analysed. 


True, 
it 
is 
customary 
to 
regard 
the 
conservation 
of 
weight, 
or, 
more 
precisely, 
the 
conservation 
of 
mass, 
as 
a 
direct 
proof 
of 
the 
constancy 
of 
matter. 
But 
this 
proof 
is 
dissolved, 
when 
we 
go 
to 
the 
bottom 
of 
it, 
into 
such 
a 
multitude 
of 
instrumental 
and 
intellectual 
operations, 
that 
in 
a 
sense 
it 
will 
be 
found 
to 
constitute 
simply 
an 
equation 
which 
our 
ideas 
in 
imitating 
facts 
have 
to 
satisfy. 
That 
obscure, 
mysterious 
lump 
which 
we 
involuntarily 
add 
in 
thought, 
we 
seek 
for 
in 
vain 
outside 
the 
mind. 


It 
is 
always, 
thus, 
the 
crude 
notion 
of 
substance 
that 
is 
slipping 
unnoticed 
into 
science, 
proving 
itself 
constantly 
insufficient, 
and 
ever 
under 
the 
necessity 
of 
being 
reduced 
to 
smaller 
and 
smaller 
world-particles. 
Here, 
as 
elsewhere, 
the 
lower 
stage 
is 
not 
rendered 
indispensable 
by 
the 
higher 
which 
is 
built 
upon 
it, 
no 
more 
than 
the 
simplest 
mode 
of 
locomotion, 
walking, 
is 
rendered 
superfluous 
by 
the 
most 
elaborate 
means 
of 
transportation. 
Body, 
as 
a 
compound 
of 
light 
and 
touch 
sensations, 
knit 
together 
by 
sensations 
of 
space, 
must 
be 
as 
familiar 
to 
the 
physicist 
who 
seeks 
it, 
as 
to 
the 
animal 
who 
hunts 
its 
prey. 
But 
the 
student 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
like 
the 
geologist 
and 
the 
astronomer, 
must 
be 
permitted 
to 
reason 
back 
from 
the 
forms 
which 
are 
created 
before 
his 
eyes 
to 
others 
which 
he 
finds 
ready 
made 
for 
him. 


All 
physical 
ideas 
and 
principles 
are 
succinct 
directions, 
frequently 
involving 
subordinate 
directions, 
for 
the 
employment 
of 
economically 
classified 
experiences, 
ready 
for 
use. 
Their 
conciseness, 
as 
also 
the 
fact 
that 
their 
contents 
are 
rarely 
exhibited 
in 
full, 
often 
invests 
them 
with 
the 
semblance 
of 
independent 
existence. 
Poetical 
myths 
regarding 
such 
ideas,—for 
example, 
that 
of 
Time, 
the 
producer 
and 
devourer 
of 
all 
things,—do 
not 
concern 
us 
here. 
We 
need 
only 
remind 
the 
reader 
that 
even 
Newton 
speaks 
of 
an 
absolute 
time 
independent 
of 
all 
phenomena, 
and 
of 
an 
absolute 
space— 
views 
which 
even 
Kant 
did 
not 
shake 
off, 
and 
which 
are 
often 
seriously 
entertained 
to-day. 
For 
the 
natural 
inquirer, 
determinations 
of 
time 
are 
merely 
abbreviated 
statements 
of 
the 
dependence 
of 
one 
event 
upon 
another, 
and 
nothing 
more. 
When 
we 
say 
the 
acceleration 
of 
a 
freely 
falling 
body 
is 
9·810 
metres 
per 
second, 
we 
mean 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
body 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
earth 
is 
9·810 
metres 
greater 
when 
the 
earth 
has 
performed 
an 



additional 
86400th 
part 
of 
its 
rotation—a 
fact 
which 
itself 
can 
be 
determined 
only 
by 
the 
earth's 
relation 
to 
other 
heavenly 
bodies. 
Again, 
in 
velocity 
is 
contained 
simply 
a 
relation 
of 
the 
position 
of 
a 
body 
to 
the 
position 
of 
the 
earth. 
[65] 
Instead 
of 
referring 
events 
to 
the 
earth 
we 
may 
refer 
them 
to 
a 
clock, 
or 
even 
to 
our 
internal 
sensation 
of 
time. 
Now, 
because 
all 
are 
connected, 
and 
each 
may 
be 
made 
the 
measure 
of 
the 
rest, 
the 
illusion 
easily 
arises 
that 
time 
has 
significance 
independently 
of 
all. 
[66] 


The 
aim 
of 
research 
is 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
equations 
which 
subsist 
between 
the 
elements 
of 
phenomena. 
The 
equation 
of 
an 
ellipse 
expresses 
the 
universal 
conceivable 
relation 
between 
its 
co-ordinates, 
of 
which 
only 
the 
real 
values 
have 
geometrical 
significance. 
Similarly, 
the 
equations 
between 
the 
elements 
of 
phenomena 
express 
a 
universal, 
mathematically 
conceivable 
relation. 
Here, 
however, 
for 
many 
values 
only 
certain 
directions 
of 
change 
are 
physically 
admissible. 
As 
in 
the 
ellipse 
only 
certain 
values 
satisfying 
the 
equation 
are 
realised, 
so 
in 
the 
physical 
world 
only 
certain 
changes 
of 
value 
occur. 
Bodies 
are 
always 
accelerated 
towards 
the 
earth. 
Differences 
of 
temperature, 
left 
to 
themselves, 
always 
grow 
less; 
and 
so 
on. 
Similarly, 
with 
respect 
to 
space, 
mathematical 
and 
physiological 
researches 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
space 
of 
experience 
is 
simply 
an 
actual 
case 
of 
many 
conceivable 
cases, 
about 
whose 
peculiar 
properties 
experience 
alone 
can 
instruct 
us. 
The 
elucidation 
which 
this 
idea 
diffuses 
cannot 
be 
questioned, 
despite 
the 
absurd 
uses 
to 
which 
it 
has 
been 
put. 


Let 
us 
endeavor 
now 
to 
summarise 
the 
results 
of 
our 
survey. 
In 
the 
economical 
schematism 
of 
science 
lie 
both 
its 
strength 
and 
its 
weakness. 
Facts 
are 
always 
represented 
at 
a 
sacrifice 
of 
completeness 
and 
never 
with 
greater 
precision 
than 
fits 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
moment. 
The 
incongruence 
between 
thought 
and 
experience, 
therefore, 
will 
continue 
to 
subsist 
as 
long 
as 
the 
two 
pursue 
their 
course 
side 
by 
side; 
but 
it 
will 
be 
continually 
diminished. 


In 
reality, 
the 
point 
involved 
is 
always 
the 
completion 
of 
some 
partial 
experience; 
the 
derivation 
of 
one 
portion 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
from 
some 
other. 
In 
this 
act 
our 
ideas 
must 
be 
based 
directly 
upon 
sensations. 
We 
call 
this 
measuring. 
[67] 
The 
condition 
of 
science, 
both 
in 
its 
origin 
and 
in 
its 
application, 
is 
a 
great 
relative 
stability 
of 
our 
environment. 
What 
it 
teaches 
us 
is 
interdependence. 
Absolute 
forecasts, 
consequently, 
have 
no 
significance 



in 
science. 
With 
great 
changes 
in 
celestial 
space 
we 
should 
lose 
our 
coordinate 
systems 
of 
space 
and 
time. 


When 
a 
geometer 
wishes 
to 
understand 
the 
form 
of 
a 
curve, 
he 
first 
resolves 
it 
into 
small 
rectilinear 
elements. 
In 
doing 
this, 
however, 
he 
is 
fully 
aware 
that 
these 
elements 
are 
only 
provisional 
and 
arbitrary 
devices 
for 
comprehending 
in 
parts 
what 
he 
cannot 
comprehend 
as 
a 
whole. 
When 
the 
law 
of 
the 
curve 
is 
found 
he 
no 
longer 
thinks 
of 
the 
elements. 
Similarly, 
it 
would 
not 
become 
physical 
science 
to 
see 
in 
its 
self-created, 
changeable, 
economical 
tools, 
molecules 
and 
atoms, 
realities 
behind 
phenomena, 
forgetful 
of 
the 
lately 
acquired 
sapience 
of 
her 
older 
sister, 
philosophy, 
in 
substituting 
a 
mechanical 
mythology 
for 
the 
old 
animistic 
or 
metaphysical 
scheme, 
and 
thus 
creating 
no 
end 
of 
suppositious 
problems. 
The 
atom 
must 
remain 
a 
tool 
for 
representing 
phenomena, 
like 
the 
functions 
of 
mathematics. 
Gradually, 
however, 
as 
the 
intellect, 
by 
contact 
with 
its 
subject-matter, 
grows 
in 
discipline, 
physical 
science 
will 
give 
up 
its 
mosaic 
play 
with 
stones 
and 
will 
seek 
out 
the 
boundaries 
and 
forms 
of 
the 
bed 
in 
which 
the 
living 
stream 
of 
phenomena 
flows. 
The 
goal 
which 
it 
has 
set 
itself 
is 
the 
simplest 
and 
most 
economical 
abstract 
expression 
of 
facts. 


The 
question 
now 
remains, 
whether 
the 
same 
method 
of 
research 
which 
till 
now 
we 
have 
tacitly 
restricted 
to 
physics, 
is 
also 
applicable 
in 
the 
psychical 
domain. 
This 
question 
will 
appear 
superfluous 
to 
the 
physical 
inquirer. 
Our 
physical 
and 
psychical 
views 
spring 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
manner 
from 
instinctive 
knowledge. 
We 
read 
the 
thoughts 
of 
men 
in 
their 
acts 
and 
facial 
expressions 
without 
knowing 
how. 
Just 
as 
we 
predict 
the 
behavior 
of 
a 
magnetic 
needle 
placed 
near 
a 
current 
by 
imagining 
Ampère's 
swimmer 
in 
the 
current, 
similarly 
we 
predict 
in 
thought 
the 
acts 
and 
behavior 
of 
men 
by 
assuming 
sensations, 
feelings, 
and 
wills 
similar 
to 
our 
own 
connected 
with 
their 
bodies. 
What 
we 
here 
instinctively 
perform 
would 
appear 
to 
us 
as 
one 
of 
the 
subtlest 
achievements 
of 
science, 
far 
outstripping 
in 
significance 
and 
ingenuity 
Ampère's 
rule 
of 
the 
swimmer, 
were 
it 
not 
that 
every 
child 
unconsciously 
accomplished 
it. 
The 
question 
simply 
is, 
therefore, 
to 
grasp 
scientifically, 
that 
is, 
by 
conceptional 
thought, 
what 
we 
are 
already 
familiar 
with 
from 
other 
sources. 
And 
here 
much 
is 
to 
be 
accomplished. 
A 
long 
sequence 
of 
facts 
is 
to 
be 
disclosed 
between 
the 
physics 
of 
expression 
and 



movement 
and 
feeling 
and 
thought. 


We 
hear 
the 
question, 
"But 
how 
is 
it 
possible 
to 
explain 
feeling 
by 
the 
motions 
of 
the 
atoms 
of 
the 
brain?" 
Certainly 
this 
will 
never 
be 
done, 
no 
more 
than 
light 
or 
heat 
will 
ever 
be 
deduced 
from 
the 
law 
of 
refraction. 
We 
need 
not 
deplore, 
therefore, 
the 
lack 
of 
ingenious 
solutions 
of 
this 
question. 
The 
problem 
is 
not 
a 
problem. 
A 
child 
looking 
over 
the 
walls 
of 
a 
city 
or 
of 
a 
fort 
into 
the 
moat 
below 
sees 
with 
astonishment 
living 
people 
in 
it, 
and 
not 
knowing 
of 
the 
portal 
which 
connects 
the 
wall 
with 
the 
moat, 
cannot 
understand 
how 
they 
could 
have 
got 
down 
from 
the 
high 
ramparts. 
So 
it 
is 
with 
the 
notions 
of 
physics. 
We 
cannot 
climb 
up 
into 
the 
province 
of 
psychology 
by 
the 
ladder 
of 
our 
abstractions, 
but 
we 
can 
climb 
down 
into 
it. 


Let 
us 
look 
at 
the 
matter 
without 
bias. 
The 
world 
consists 
of 
colors, 
sounds, 
temperatures, 
pressures, 
spaces, 
times, 
and 
so 
forth, 
which 
now 
we 
shall 
not 
call 
sensations, 
nor 
phenomena, 
because 
in 
either 
term 
an 
arbitrary, 
one-sided 
theory 
is 
embodied, 
but 
simply 
elements. 
The 
fixing 
of 
the 
flux 
of 
these 
elements, 
whether 
mediately 
or 
immediately, 
is 
the 
real 
object 
of 
physical 
research. 
As 
long 
as, 
neglecting 
our 
own 
body, 
we 
employ 
ourselves 
with 
the 
interdependence 
of 
those 
groups 
of 
elements 
which, 
including 
men 
and 
animals, 
make 
up 
foreign 
bodies, 
we 
are 
physicists. 
For 
example, 
we 
investigate 
the 
change 
of 
the 
red 
color 
of 
a 
body 
as 
produced 
by 
a 
change 
of 
illumination. 
But 
the 
moment 
we 
consider 
the 
special 
influence 
on 
the 
red 
of 
the 
elements 
constituting 
our 
body, 
outlined 
by 
the 
well-known 
perspective 
with 
head 
invisible, 
we 
are 
at 
work 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
physiological 
psychology. 
We 
close 
our 
eyes, 
and 
the 
red 
together 
with 
the 
whole 
visible 
world 
disappears. 
There 
exists, 
thus, 
in 
the 
perspective 
field 
of 
every 
sense 
a 
portion 
which 
exercises 
on 
all 
the 
rest 
a 
different 
and 
more 
powerful 
influence 
than 
the 
rest 
upon 
one 
another. 
With 
this, 
however, 
all 
is 
said. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
this 
remark, 
we 
call 
all 
elements, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
we 
regard 
them 
as 
dependent 
on 
this 
special 
part 
(our 
body), 
sensations. 
That 
the 
world 
is 
our 
sensation, 
in 
this 
sense, 
cannot 
be 
questioned. 
But 
to 
make 
a 
system 
of 
conduct 
out 
of 
this 
provisional 
conception, 
and 
to 
abide 
its 
slaves, 
is 
as 
unnecessary 
for 
us 
as 
would 
be 
a 
similar 
course 
for 
a 
mathematician 
who, 
in 
varying 
a 
series 
of 
variables 
of 
a 
function 
which 
were 
previously 
assumed 
to 
be 
constant, 
or 
in 
interchanging 
the 
independent 
variables, 
finds 
his 
method 
to 
be 
the 
source 
of 
some 
very 
surprising 
ideas 
for 
him. 
[68] 



If 
we 
look 
at 
the 
matter 
in 
this 
unbiassed 
light 
it 
will 
appear 
indubitable 
that 
the 
method 
of 
physiological 
psychology 
is 
none 
other 
than 
that 
of 
physics; 
what 
is 
more, 
that 
this 
science 
is 
a 
part 
of 
physics. 
Its 
subject-matter 
is 
not 
different 
from 
that 
of 
physics. 
It 
will 
unquestionably 
determine 
the 
relations 
the 
sensations 
bear 
to 
the 
physics 
of 
our 
body. 
We 
have 
already 
learned 
from 
a 
member 
of 
this 
academy 
(Hering) 
that 
in 
all 
probability 
a 
sixfold 
manifoldness 
of 
the 
chemical 
processes 
of 
the 
visual 
substance 
corresponds 
to 
the 
sixfold 
manifoldness 
of 
color-sensation, 
and 
a 
threefold 
manifoldness 
of 
the 
physiological 
processes 
to 
the 
threefold 
manifoldness 
of 
space-
sensations. 
The 
paths 
of 
reflex 
actions 
and 
of 
the 
will 
are 
followed 
up 
and 
disclosed; 
it 
is 
ascertained 
what 
region 
of 
the 
brain 
subserves 
the 
function 
of 
speech, 
what 
region 
the 
function 
of 
locomotion, 
etc. 
That 
which 
still 
clings 
to 
our 
body, 
namely, 
our 
thoughts, 
will, 
when 
those 
investigations 
are 
finished, 
present 
no 
difficulties 
new 
in 
principle. 
When 
experience 
has 
once 
clearly 
exhibited 
these 
facts 
and 
science 
has 
marshalled 
them 
in 
economic 
and 
perspicuous 
order, 
there 
is 
no 
doubt 
that 
we 
shall 
understand 
them. 
For 
other 
"understanding" 
than 
a 
mental 
mastery 
of 
facts 
never 
existed. 
Science 
does 
not 
create 
facts 
from 
facts, 
but 
simply 
orders 
known 
facts. 


Let 
us 
look, 
now, 
a 
little 
more 
closely 
into 
the 
modes 
of 
research 
of 
physiological 
psychology. 
We 
have 
a 
very 
clear 
idea 
of 
how 
a 
body 
moves 
in 
the 
space 
encompassing 
it. 
With 
our 
optical 
field 
of 
sight 
we 
are 
very 
familiar. 
But 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
state, 
as 
a 
rule, 
how 
we 
have 
come 
by 
an 
idea, 
from 
what 
corner 
of 
our 
intellectual 
field 
of 
sight 
it 
has 
entered, 
or 
by 
what 
region 
the 
impulse 
to 
a 
motion 
is 
sent 
forth. 
Moreover, 
we 
shall 
never 
get 
acquainted 
with 
this 
mental 
field 
of 
view 
from 
self-observation 
alone. 
Self-
observation, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
physiological 
research, 
which 
seeks 
out 
physical 
connexions, 
can 
put 
this 
field 
of 
vision 
in 
a 
clear 
light 
before 
us, 
and 
will 
thus 
first 
really 
reveal 
to 
us 
our 
inner 
man. 


Primarily, 
natural 
science, 
or 
physics, 
in 
its 
widest 
sense, 
makes 
us 
acquainted 
with 
only 
the 
firmest 
connexions 
of 
groups 
of 
elements. 
Provisorily, 
we 
may 
not 
bestow 
too 
much 
attention 
on 
the 
single 
constituents 
of 
those 
groups, 
if 
we 
are 
desirous 
of 
retaining 
a 
comprehensible 
whole. 
Instead 
of 
equations 
between 
the 
primitive 
variables, 
physics 
gives 
us, 
as 
much 
the 
easiest 
course, 
equations 
between 
functions 
of 
those 
variables. 
Physiological 
psychology 
teaches 
us 
how 
to 
separate 
the 
visible, 
the 
tangible, 



and 
the 
audible 
from 
bodies—a 
labor 
which 
is 
subsequently 
richly 
requited, 
as 
the 
division 
of 
the 
subjects 
of 
physics 
well 
shows. 
Physiology 
further 
analyses 
the 
visible 
into 
light 
and 
space 
sensations; 
the 
first 
into 
colors, 
the 
last 
also 
into 
their 
component 
parts; 
it 
resolves 
noises 
into 
sounds, 
these 
into 
tones, 
and 
so 
on. 
Unquestionably 
this 
analysis 
can 
be 
carried 
much 
further 
than 
it 
has 
been. 
It 
will 
be 
possible 
in 
the 
end 
to 
exhibit 
the 
common 
elements 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
very 
abstract 
but 
definite 
logical 
acts 
of 
like 
form,—elements 
which 
the 
acute 
jurist 
and 
mathematician, 
as 
it 
were, 
feels 
out, 
with 
absolute 
certainty, 
where 
the 
uninitiated 
hears 
only 
empty 
words. 
Physiology, 
in 
a 
word, 
will 
reveal 
to 
us 
the 
true 
real 
elements 
of 
the 
world. 
Physiological 
psychology 
bears 
to 
physics 
in 
its 
widest 
sense 
a 
relation 
similar 
to 
that 
which 
chemistry 
bears 
to 
physics 
in 
its 
narrowest 
sense. 
But 
far 
greater 
than 
the 
mutual 
support 
of 
physics 
and 
chemistry 
will 
be 
that 
which 
natural 
science 
and 
psychology 
will 
render 
each 
other. 
And 
the 
results 
that 
shall 
spring 
from 
this 
union 
will, 
in 
all 
likelihood, 
far 
outstrip 
those 
of 
the 
modern 
mechanical 
physics. 


What 
those 
ideas 
are 
with 
which 
we 
shall 
comprehend 
the 
world 
when 
the 
closed 
circuit 
of 
physical 
and 
psychological 
facts 
shall 
lie 
complete 
before 
us, 
(that 
circuit 
of 
which 
we 
now 
see 
only 
two 
disjoined 
parts,) 
cannot 
be 
foreseen 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
work. 
The 
men 
will 
be 
found 
who 
will 
see 
what 
is 
right 
and 
will 
have 
the 
courage, 
instead 
of 
wandering 
in 
the 
intricate 
paths 
of 
logical 
and 
historical 
accident, 
to 
enter 
on 
the 
straight 
ways 
to 
the 
heights 
from 
which 
the 
mighty 
stream 
of 
facts 
can 
be 
surveyed. 
Whether 
the 
notion 
which 
we 
now 
call 
matter 
will 
continue 
to 
have 
a 
scientific 
significance 
beyond 
the 
crude 
purposes 
of 
common 
life, 
we 
do 
not 
know. 
But 
we 
certainly 
shall 
wonder 
how 
colors 
and 
tones 
which 
were 
such 
innermost 
parts 
of 
us 
could 
suddenly 
get 
lost 
in 
our 
physical 
world 
of 
atoms; 
how 
we 
could 
be 
suddenly 
surprised 
that 
something 
which 
outside 
us 
simply 
clicked 
and 
beat, 
in 
our 
heads 
should 
make 
light 
and 
music; 
and 
how 
we 
could 
ask 
whether 
matter 
can 
feel, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
whether 
a 
mental 
symbol 
for 
a 
group 
of 
sensations 
can 
feel? 


We 
cannot 
mark 
out 
in 
hard 
and 
fast 
lines 
the 
science 
of 
the 
future, 
but 
we 
can 
foresee 
that 
the 
rigid 
walls 
which 
now 
divide 
man 
from 
the 
world 
will 
gradually 
disappear; 
that 
human 
beings 
will 
not 
only 
confront 
each 
other, 
but 
also 
the 
entire 
organic 
and 
so-called 
lifeless 
world, 
with 
less 
selfishness 
and 



with 
livelier 
sympathy. 
Just 
such 
a 
presentiment 
as 
this 
perhaps 
possessed 
the 
great 
Chinese 
philosopher 
Licius 
some 
two 
thousand 
years 
ago 
when, 
pointing 
to 
a 
heap 
of 
mouldering 
human 
bones, 
he 
said 
to 
his 
scholars 
in 
the 
rigid, 
lapidary 
style 
of 
his 
tongue: 
"These 
and 
I 
alone 
have 
the 
knowledge 
that 
we 
neither 
live 
nor 
are 
dead." 



ON 
TRANSFORMATION 
AND 
ADAPTATION 
IN 


SCIENTIFIC 
THOUGHT. 
[69] 


It 
was 
towards 
the 
close 
of 
the 
sixteenth 
century 
that 
Galileo 
with 
a 
superb 
indifference 
to 
the 
dialectic 
arts 
and 
sophistic 
subtleties 
of 
the 
Schoolmen 
of 
his 
time, 
turned 
the 
attention 
of 
his 
brilliant 
mind 
to 
nature. 
By 
nature 
his 
ideas 
were 
transformed 
and 
released 
from 
the 
fetters 
of 
inherited 
prejudice. 
At 
once 
the 
mighty 
revolution 
was 
felt, 
that 
was 
therewith 
effected 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
human 
thought—felt 
indeed 
in 
circles 
far 
remote 
and 
wholly 
unrelated 
to 
the 
sphere 
of 
science, 
felt 
in 
strata 
of 
society 
that 
hitherto 
had 
only 
indirectly 
recognised 
the 
influence 
of 
scientific 
thought. 


And 
how 
great 
and 
how 
far-reaching 
that 
revolution 
was! 
From 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
seventeenth 
century 
till 
its 
close 
we 
see 
arising, 
at 
least 
in 
embryo, 
almost 
all 
that 
plays 
a 
part 
in 
the 
natural 
and 
technical 
science 
of 
to-day, 
almost 
all 
that 
in 
the 
two 
centuries 
following 
so 
wonderfully 
transformed 
the 
facial 
appearance 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
all 
that 
is 
moving 
onward 
in 
process 
of 
such 
mighty 
evolution 
to-day. 
And 
all 
this, 
the 
direct 
result 
of 
Galilean 
ideas, 
the 
direct 
outcome 
of 
that 
freshly 
awakened 
sense 
for 
the 
investigation 
of 
natural 
phenomena 
which 
taught 
the 
Tuscan 
philosopher 
to 
form 
the 
concept 
and 
the 
law 
of 
falling 
bodies 
from 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
falling 
stone! 
Galileo 
began 
his 
investigations 
without 
an 
implement 
worthy 
of 
the 
name; 
he 
measured 
time 
in 
the 
most 
primitive 
way, 
by 
the 
efflux 
of 
water. 
Yet 
soon 
afterwards 
the 
telescope, 
the 
microscope, 
the 
barometer, 
the 
thermometer, 
the 
air-pump, 
the 
steam 
engine, 
the 
pendulum, 
and 
the 
electrical 
machine 
were 
invented 
in 
rapid 
succession. 
The 
fundamental 
theorems 
of 
dynamical 
science, 
of 
optics, 
of 
heat, 
and 
of 
electricity 
were 
all 
disclosed 
in 
the 
century 
that 
followed 
Galileo. 


Of 
scarcely 
less 
importance, 
it 
seems, 
was 
that 
movement 
which 
was 
prepared 
for 
by 
the 
illustrious 
biologists 
of 
the 
hundred 
years 
just 
past, 
and 
formally 
begun 
by 
the 
late 
Mr. 
Darwin. 
Galileo 
quickened 
the 
sense 
for 
the 
simpler 
phenomena 
of 
inorganic 
nature. 
And 
with 
the 
same 
simplicity 
and 
frankness 
that 
marked 
the 
efforts 
of 
Galileo, 
and 
without 
the 
aid 
of 
technical 



or 
scientific 
instruments, 
without 
physical 
or 
chemical 
experiment, 
but 
solely 
by 
the 
power 
of 
thought 
and 
observation, 
Darwin 
grasps 
a 
new 
property 
of 
organic 
nature—which 
we 
may 
briefly 
call 
its 
plasticity. 
[70] 
With 
the 
same 
directness 
of 
purpose, 
Darwin, 
too, 
pursues 
his 
way. 
With 
the 
same 
candor 
and 
love 
of 
truth, 
he 
points 
out 
the 
strength 
and 
the 
weakness 
of 
his 
demonstrations. 
With 
masterly 
equanimity 
he 
holds 
aloof 
from 
the 
discussion 
of 
irrelevant 
subjects 
and 
wins 
alike 
the 
admiration 
of 
his 
adherents 
and 
of 
his 
adversaries. 


Scarcely 
thirty 
years 
have 
elapsed 
[71] 
since 
Darwin 
first 
propounded 
the 
principles 
of 
his 
theory 
of 
evolution. 
Yet, 
already 
we 
see 
his 
ideas 
firmly 
rooted 
in 
every 
branch 
of 
human 
thought, 
however 
remote. 
Everywhere, 
in 
history, 
in 
philosophy, 
even 
in 
the 
physical 
sciences, 
we 
hear 
the 
watchwords: 
heredity, 
adaptation, 
selection. 
We 
speak 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
existence 
among 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
and 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
existence 
in 
the 
world 
of 
molecules. 
[72] 


The 
impetus 
given 
by 
Galileo 
to 
scientific 
thought 
was 
marked 
in 
every 
direction; 
thus, 
his 
pupil, 
Borelli, 
founded 
the 
school 
of 
exact 
medicine, 
from 
whence 
proceeded 
even 
distinguished 
mathematicians. 
And 
now 
Darwinian 
ideas, 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
are 
animating 
all 
provinces 
of 
research. 
It 
is 
true, 
nature 
is 
not 
made 
up 
of 
two 
distinct 
parts, 
the 
inorganic 
and 
the 
organic; 
nor 
must 
these 
two 
divisions 
be 
treated 
perforce 
by 
totally 
distinct 
methods. 
Many 
sides, 
however, 
nature 
has. 
Nature 
is 
like 
a 
thread 
in 
an 
intricate 
tangle, 
which 
must 
be 
followed 
and 
traced, 
now 
from 
this 
point, 
now 
from 
that. 
But 
we 
must 
never 
imagine,—and 
this 
physicists 
have 
learned 
from 
Faraday 
and 


J. 
R. 
Mayer,—that 
progress 
along 
paths 
once 
entered 
upon 
is 
the 
only 
means 
of 
reaching 
the 
truth. 
It 
will 
devolve 
upon 
the 
specialists 
of 
the 
future 
to 
determine 
the 
relative 
tenability 
and 
fruitfulness 
of 
the 
Darwinian 
ideas 
in 
the 
different 
provinces. 
Here 
I 
wish 
simply 
to 
consider 
the 
growth 
of 
natural 
knowledge 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
evolution. 
For 
knowledge, 
too, 
is 
a 
product 
of 
organic 
nature. 
And 
although 
ideas, 
as 
such, 
do 
not 
comport 
themselves 
in 
all 
respects 
like 
independent 
organic 
individuals, 
and 
although 
violent 
comparisons 
should 
be 
avoided, 
still, 
if 
Darwin 
reasoned 
rightly, 
the 
general 
imprint 
of 
evolution 
and 
transformation 
must 
be 
noticeable 
in 
ideas 
also. 



I 
shall 
waive 
here 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
fruitful 
topic 
of 
the 
transmission 
of 
ideas 
or 
rather 
of 
the 
transmission 
of 
the 
aptitude 
for 
certain 
ideas. 
[73] 
Nor 
would 
it 
come 
within 
my 
province 
to 
discuss 
psychical 
evolution 
in 
any 
form, 
as 
Spencer 
[74] 
and 
many 
other 
modern 
psychologists 
have 
done, 
with 
varying 
success. 
Neither 
shall 
I 
enter 
upon 
a 
discussion 
of 
the 
struggle 
for 
existence 
and 
of 
natural 
selection 
among 
scientific 
theories. 
[75] 
We 
shall 
consider 
here 
only 
such 
processes 
of 
transformation 
as 
every 
student 
can 
easily 
observe 
in 
his 
own 
mind. 


The 
child 
of 
the 
forest 
picks 
out 
and 
pursues 
with 
marvellous 
acuteness 
the 
trails 
of 
animals. 
He 
outwits 
and 
overreaches 
his 
foes 
with 
surpassing 
cunning. 
He 
is 
perfectly 
at 
home 
in 
the 
sphere 
of 
his 
peculiar 
experience. 
But 
confront 
him 
with 
an 
unwonted 
phenomenon; 
place 
him 
face 
to 
face 
with 
a 
technical 
product 
of 
modern 
civilisation, 
and 
he 
will 
lapse 
into 
impotency 
and 
helplessness. 
Here 
are 
facts 
which 
he 
does 
not 
comprehend. 
If 
he 
endeavors 
to 
grasp 
their 
meaning, 
he 
misinterprets 
them. 
He 
fancies 
the 
moon, 
when 
eclipsed, 
to 
be 
tormented 
by 
an 
evil 
spirit. 
To 
his 
mind 
a 
puffing 
locomotive 
is 
a 
living 
monster. 
The 
letter 
accompanying 
a 
commission 
with 
which 
he 
is 
entrusted, 
having 
once 
revealed 
his 
thievishness, 
is 
in 
his 
imagination 
a 
conscious 
being, 
which 
he 
must 
hide 
beneath 
a 
stone, 
before 
venturing 
to 
commit 
a 
fresh 
trespass. 
Arithmetic 
to 
him 
is 
like 
the 
art 
of 
the 
geomancers 
in 
the 
Arabian 
Nights,—an 
art 
which 
is 
able 
to 
accomplish 
every 
imaginable 
impossibility. 
And, 
like 
Voltaire's 
ingénu, 
when 
placed 
in 
our 
social 
world, 
he 
plays, 
as 
we 
think, 
the 
maddest 
pranks. 


With 
the 
man 
who 
has 
made 
the 
achievements 
of 
modern 
science 
and 
civilisation 
his 
own, 
the 
case 
is 
quite 
different. 
He 
sees 
the 
moon 
pass 
temporarily 
into 
the 
shadow 
of 
the 
earth. 
He 
feels 
in 
his 
thoughts 
the 
water 
growing 
hot 
in 
the 
boiler 
of 
the 
locomotive; 
he 
feels 
also 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
tension 
which 
pushes 
the 
piston 
forward. 
Where 
he 
is 
not 
able 
to 
trace 
the 
direct 
relation 
of 
things 
he 
has 
recourse 
to 
his 
yard-stick 
and 
table 
of 
logarithms, 
which 
aid 
and 
facilitate 
his 
thought 
without 
predominating 
over 
it. 
Such 
opinions 
as 
he 
cannot 
concur 
in, 
are 
at 
least 
known 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
knows 
how 
to 
meet 
them 
in 
argument. 


Now, 
wherein 
does 
the 
difference 
between 
these 
two 
men 
consist? 
The 
train 



of 
thought 
habitually 
employed 
by 
the 
first 
one 
does 
not 
correspond 
to 
the 
facts 
that 
he 
sees. 
He 
is 
surprised 
and 
nonplussed 
at 
every 
step. 
But 
the 
thoughts 
of 
the 
second 
man 
follow 
and 
anticipate 
events, 
his 
thoughts 
have 
become 
adapted 
or 
accommodated 
to 
the 
larger 
field 
of 
observation 
and 
activity 
in 
which 
he 
is 
located; 
he 
conceives 
things 
as 
they 
are. 
The 
Indian's 
sphere 
of 
experience, 
however, 
is 
quite 
different; 
his 
bodily 
organs 
of 
sense 
are 
in 
constant 
activity; 
he 
is 
ever 
intensely 
alert 
and 
on 
the 
watch 
for 
his 
foes; 
or, 
his 
entire 
attention 
and 
energy 
are 
engaged 
in 
procuring 
sustenance. 
Now, 
how 
can 
such 
a 
creature 
project 
his 
mind 
into 
futurity, 
foresee 
or 
prophesy? 
This 
is 
not 
possible 
until 
our 
fellow-beings 
have, 
in 
a 
measure, 
relieved 
us 
of 
our 
concern 
for 
existence. 
It 
is 
then 
that 
we 
acquire 
freedom 
for 
observation, 
and 
not 
infrequently 
too 
that 
narrowness 
of 
thought 
which 
society 
helps 
and 
teaches 
us 
to 
disregard. 


If 
we 
move 
for 
a 
time 
within 
a 
fixed 
circle 
of 
phenomena 
which 
recur 
with 
unvarying 
uniformity, 
our 
thoughts 
gradually 
adapt 
themselves 
to 
our 
environment; 
our 
ideas 
reflect 
unconsciously 
our 
surroundings. 
The 
stone 
we 
hold 
in 
our 
hand, 
when 
dropped, 
not 
only 
falls 
to 
the 
ground 
in 
reality; 
it 
also 
falls 
in 
our 
thoughts. 
Iron-filings 
dart 
towards 
a 
magnet 
in 
imagination 
as 
well 
as 
in 
fact, 
and, 
when 
thrown 
into 
a 
fire, 
they 
grew 
hot 
in 
conception 
as 
well. 


The 
impulse 
to 
complete 
mentally 
a 
phenomenon 
that 
has 
been 
only 
partially 
observed, 
has 
not 
its 
origin 
in 
the 
phenomenon 
itself; 
of 
this 
fact, 
we 
are 
fully 
sensible. 
And 
we 
well 
know 
that 
it 
does 
not 
lie 
within 
the 
sphere 
of 
our 
volition. 
It 
seems 
to 
confront 
us 
rather 
as 
a 
power 
and 
a 
law 
imposed 
from 
without 
and 
controlling 
both 
thought 
and 
facts. 


The 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
able 
by 
the 
help 
of 
this 
law 
to 
prophesy 
and 
forecast, 
merely 
proves 
a 
sameness 
or 
uniformity 
of 
environment 
sufficient 
to 
effect 
a 
mental 
adaptation 
of 
this 
kind. 
A 
necessity 
of 
fulfilment, 
however, 
is 
not 
contained 
in 
this 
compulsory 
principle 
which 
controls 
our 
thoughts; 
nor 
is 
it 
in 
any 
way 
determined 
by 
the 
possibility 
of 
prediction. 
We 
are 
always 
obliged, 
in 
fact, 
to 
await 
the 
completion 
of 
what 
has 
been 
predicted. 
Errors 
and 
departures 
are 
constantly 
discernible, 
and 
are 
slight 
only 
in 
provinces 
of 
great 
rigid 
constancy, 
as 
in 
astronomy. 


In 
cases 
where 
our 
thoughts 
follow 
the 
connexion 
of 
events 
with 
ease, 
and 
in 



instances 
where 
we 
positively 
forefeel 
the 
course 
of 
a 
phenomenon, 
it 
is 
natural 
to 
fancy 
that 
the 
latter 
is 
determined 
by 
and 
must 
conform 
to 
our 
thoughts. 
But 
the 
belief 
in 
that 
mysterious 
agency 
called 
causality, 
which 
holds 
thought 
and 
event 
in 
unison, 
is 
violently 
shaken 
when 
a 
person 
first 
enters 
a 
province 
of 
inquiry 
in 
which 
he 
has 
previously 
had 
no 
experience. 
Take 
for 
instance 
the 
strange 
interaction 
of 
electric 
currents 
and 
magnets, 
or 
the 
reciprocal 
action 
of 
currents, 
which 
seem 
to 
defy 
all 
the 
resources 
of 
mechanical 
science. 
Let 
him 
be 
confronted 
with 
such 
phenomena 
and 
he 
will 
immediately 
feel 
himself 
forsaken 
by 
his 
power 
of 
prediction; 
he 
will 
bring 
nothing 
with 
him 
into 
this 
strange 
field 
of 
events 
but 
the 
hope 
of 
soon 
being 
able 
to 
adapt 
his 
ideas 
to 
the 
new 
conditions 
there 
presented. 


A 
person 
constructs 
from 
a 
bone 
the 
remaining 
anatomy 
of 
an 
animal; 
or 
from 
the 
visible 
part 
of 
a 
half-concealed 
wing 
of 
a 
butterfly 
he 
infers 
and 
reconstructs 
the 
part 
concealed. 
He 
does 
so 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
highest 
confidence 
in 
the 
accuracy 
of 
his 
results; 
and 
in 
these 
processes 
we 
find 
nothing 
preternatural 
or 
transcendent. 
But 
when 
physicists 
adapt 
their 
thoughts 
to 
conform 
to 
the 
dynamical 
course 
of 
events 
in 
time, 
we 
invariably 
surround 
their 
investigations 
with 
a 
metaphysical 
halo; 
yet 
these 
latter 
adaptations 
bear 
quite 
the 
same 
character 
as 
the 
former, 
and 
our 
only 
reason 
for 
investing 
them 
with 
a 
metaphysical 
garb, 
perhaps, 
is 
their 
high 
practical 
value. 
[76] 


Let 
us 
consider 
for 
a 
moment 
what 
takes 
place 
when 
the 
field 
of 
observation 
to 
which 
our 
ideas 
have 
been 
adapted 
and 
now 
conform, 
becomes 
enlarged. 
We 
had, 
let 
us 
say, 
always 
seen 
heavy 
bodies 
sink 
when 
their 
support 
was 
taken 
away; 
we 
had 
also 
seen, 
perhaps, 
that 
the 
sinking 
of 
heavier 
bodies 
forced 
lighter 
bodies 
upwards. 
But 
now 
we 
see 
a 
lever 
in 
action, 
and 
we 
are 
suddenly 
struck 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
lighter 
body 
is 
lifting 
another 
of 
much 
greater 
weight. 
Our 
customary 
train 
of 
thought 
demands 
its 
rights; 
the 
new 
and 
unwonted 
event 
likewise 
demands 
its 
rights. 
From 
this 
conflict 
between 
thought 
and 
fact 
the 
problem 
arises; 
out 
of 
this 
partial 
contrariety 
springs 
the 
question, 
"Why?" 
With 
the 
new 
adaptation 
to 
the 
enlarged 
field 
of 
observation, 
the 
problem 
disappears, 
or, 
in 
other 
words, 
is 
solved. 
In 
the 
instance 
cited, 
we 
must 
adopt 
the 
habit 
of 
always 
considering 
the 
mechanical 
work 
performed. 



The 
child 
just 
awakening 
into 
consciousness 
of 
the 
world, 
knows 
no 
problem. 
The 
bright 
flower, 
the 
ringing 
bell, 
are 
all 
new 
to 
it; 
yet 
it 
is 
surprised 
at 
nothing. 
The 
out 
and 
out 
Philistine, 
whose 
only 
thoughts 
lie 
in 
the 
beaten 
path 
of 
his 
every-day 
pursuits, 
likewise 
has 
no 
problems. 
Everything 
goes 
its 
wonted 
course, 
and 
if 
perchance 
a 
thing 
go 
wrong 
at 
times, 
it 
is 
at 
most 
a 
mere 
object 
of 
curiosity 
and 
not 
worth 
serious 
consideration. 
In 
fact, 
the 
question 
"Why?" 
loses 
all 
warrant 
in 
relations 
where 
we 
are 
familiar 
with 
every 
aspect 
of 
events. 
But 
the 
capable 
and 
talented 
young 
man 
has 
his 
head 
full 
of 
problems; 
he 
has 
acquired, 
to 
a 
greater 
or 
less 
degree, 
certain 
habitudes 
of 
thought, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
is 
constantly 
observing 
what 
is 
new 
and 
unwonted, 
and 
in 
his 
case 
there 
is 
no 
end 
to 
the 
questions, 
"Why?" 


Thus, 
the 
factor 
which 
most 
promotes 
scientific 
thought 
is 
the 
gradual 
widening 
of 
the 
field 
of 
experience. 
We 
scarcely 
notice 
events 
we 
are 
accustomed 
to; 
the 
latter 
do 
not 
really 
develop 
their 
intellectual 
significance 
until 
placed 
in 
contrast 
with 
something 
to 
which 
we 
are 
unaccustomed. 
Things 
that 
at 
home 
are 
passed 
by 
unnoticed, 
delight 
us 
when 
abroad, 
though 
they 
may 
appear 
in 
only 
slightly 
different 
forms. 
The 
sun 
shines 
with 
heightened 
radiance, 
the 
flowers 
bloom 
in 
brighter 
colors, 
our 
fellow-men 
accost 
us 
with 
lighter 
and 
happier 
looks. 
And, 
returning 
home, 
we 
find 
even 
the 
old 
familiar 
scenes 
more 
inspiring 
and 
suggestive 
than 
before. 


Every 
motive 
that 
prompts 
and 
stimulates 
us 
to 
modify 
and 
transform 
our 
thoughts, 
proceeds 
from 
what 
is 
new, 
uncommon, 
and 
not 
understood. 
Novelty 
excites 
wonder 
in 
persons 
whose 
fixed 
habits 
of 
thought 
are 
shaken 
and 
disarranged 
by 
what 
they 
see. 
But 
the 
element 
of 
wonder 
never 
lies 
in 
the 
phenomenon 
or 
event 
observed; 
its 
place 
is 
in 
the 
person 
observing. 
People 
of 
more 
vigorous 
mental 
type 
aim 
at 
once 
at 
an 
adaptation 
of 
thought 
that 
will 
conform 
to 
what 
they 
have 
observed. 
Thus 
does 
science 
eventually 
become 
the 
natural 
foe 
of 
the 
wonderful. 
The 
sources 
of 
the 
marvellous 
are 
unveiled, 
and 
surprise 
gives 
way 
to 
calm 
interpretation. 


Let 
us 
consider 
such 
a 
mental 
transformative 
process 
in 
detail. 
The 
circumstance 
that 
heavy 
bodies 
fall 
to 
the 
earth 
appears 
perfectly 
natural 
and 
regular. 
But 
when 
a 
person 
observes 
that 
wood 
floats 
upon 
water, 
and 
that 
flames 
and 
smoke 
rise 
in 
the 
air, 
then 
the 
contrary 
of 
the 
first 
phenomenon 
is 
presented. 
An 
olden 
theory 
endeavors 
to 
explain 
these 
facts 
by 
imputing 
to 



substances 
the 
power 
of 
volition, 
as 
that 
attribute 
which 
is 
most 
familiar 
to 
man. 
It 
asserted 
that 
every 
substance 
seeks 
its 
proper 
place, 
heavy 
bodies 
tending 
downwards 
and 
light 
ones 
upwards. 
It 
soon 
turned 
out, 
however, 
that 
even 
smoke 
had 
weight, 
that 
it, 
too, 
sought 
its 
place 
below, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
forced 
upwards 
only 
because 
of 
the 
downward 
tendency 
of 
the 
air, 
as 
wood 
is 
forced 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
water 
because 
the 
water 
exerts 
the 
greater 
downward 
pressure. 


Again, 
we 
see 
a 
body 
thrown 
into 
the 
air. 
It 
ascends. 
How 
is 
it 
that 
it 
does 
not 
seek 
its 
proper 
place? 
Why 
does 
the 
velocity 
of 
its 
"violent" 
motion 
decrease 
as 
it 
rises, 
while 
that 
of 
its 
"natural" 
fall 
increases 
as 
it 
descends. 
If 
we 
mark 
closely 
the 
relation 
between 
these 
two 
facts, 
the 
problem 
will 
solve 
itself. 
We 
shall 
see, 
as 
Galileo 
did, 
that 
the 
decrease 
of 
velocity 
in 
rising 
and 
the 
increase 
of 
velocity 
in 
falling 
are 
one 
and 
the 
same 
phenomenon, 
viz., 
an 
increase 
of 
velocity 
towards 
the 
earth. 
Accordingly, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
place 
that 
is 
assigned 
to 
the 
body, 
but 
an 
increase 
of 
velocity 
towards 
the 
earth. 


By 
this 
idea 
the 
movements 
of 
heavy 
bodies 
are 
rendered 
perfectly 
familiar. 
Newton, 
now, 
firmly 
grasping 
this 
new 
way 
of 
thinking, 
sees 
the 
moon 
and 
the 
planets 
moving 
in 
their 
paths 
upon 
principles 
similar 
to 
those 
which 
determine 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
projectile 
thrown 
into 
the 
air. 
Yet 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
planets 
were 
marked 
by 
peculiarities 
which 
compelled 
him 
once 
more 
to 
modify 
slightly 
his 
customary 
mode 
of 
thought. 
The 
heavenly 
bodies, 
or 
rather 
the 
parts 
composing 
them, 
do 
not 
move 
with 
constant 
accelerations 
towards 
each 
other, 
but 
"attract 
each 
other," 
directly 
as 
the 
mass 
and 
inversely 
as 
the 
square 
of 
the 
distance. 


This 
latter 
notion, 
which 
includes 
the 
one 
applying 
to 
terrestrial 
bodies 
as 
a 
special 
case, 
is, 
as 
we 
see, 
quite 
different 
from 
the 
conception 
from 
which 
we 
started. 
How 
limited 
in 
scope 
was 
the 
original 
idea 
and 
to 
what 
a 
multitude 
of 
phenomena 
is 
not 
the 
present 
one 
applicable! 
Yet 
there 
is 
a 
trace, 
after 
all, 
of 
the 
"search 
for 
place" 
in 
the 
expression 
"attraction." 
And 
it 
would 
be 
folly, 
indeed, 
for 
us 
to 
avoid, 
with 
punctilious 
dread, 
this 
conception 
of 
"attraction" 
as 
bearing 
marks 
of 
its 
pedigree. 
It 
is 
the 
historical 
base 
of 
the 
Newtonian 
conception 
and 
it 
still 
continues 
to 
direct 
our 
thoughts 
in 
the 
paths 
so 
long 
familiar 
to 
us. 
Thus, 
the 
happiest 
ideas 
do 
not 
fall 
from 
heaven, 
but 
spring 
from 
notions 
already 
existing. 



Similarly, 
a 
ray 
of 
light 
was 
first 
regarded 
as 
a 
continuous 
and 
homogeneous 
straight 
line. 
It 
then 
became 
the 
path 
of 
projection 
for 
minute 
missiles; 
then 
an 
aggregate 
of 
the 
paths 
of 
countless 
different 
kinds 
of 
missiles. 
It 
became 
periodic; 
it 
acquired 
various 
sides; 
and 
ultimately 
it 
even 
lost 
its 
motion 
in 
a 
straight 
line. 


The 
electric 
current 
was 
conceived 
originally 
as 
the 
flow 
of 
a 
hypothetical 
fluid. 
To 
this 
conception 
was 
soon 
added 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
chemical 
current, 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
electric, 
magnetic, 
and 
anisotropic 
optical 
field, 
intimately 
connected 
with 
the 
path 
of 
the 
current. 
And 
the 
richer 
a 
conception 
becomes 
in 
following 
and 
keeping 
pace 
with 
facts, 
the 
better 
adapted 
it 
is 
to 
anticipate 
them. 


Adaptive 
processes 
of 
this 
kind 
have 
no 
assignable 
beginning, 
inasmuch 
as 
every 
problem 
that 
incites 
to 
new 
adaptation, 
presupposes 
a 
fixed 
habitude 
of 
thought. 
Moreover, 
they 
have 
no 
visible 
end; 
in 
so 
far 
as 
experience 
never 
ceases. 
Science, 
accordingly, 
stands 
midway 
in 
the 
evolutionary 
process; 
and 
science 
may 
advantageously 
direct 
and 
promote 
this 
process, 
but 
it 
can 
never 
take 
its 
place. 
That 
science 
is 
inconceivable 
the 
principles 
of 
which 
would 
enable 
a 
person 
with 
no 
experience 
to 
construct 
the 
world 
of 
experience, 
without 
a 
knowledge 
of 
it. 
One 
might 
just 
as 
well 
expect 
to 
become 
a 
great 
musician, 
solely 
by 
the 
aid 
of 
theory, 
and 
without 
musical 
experience; 
or 
to 
become 
a 
painter 
by 
following 
the 
directions 
of 
a 
text-book. 


In 
glancing 
over 
the 
history 
of 
an 
idea 
with 
which 
we 
have 
become 
perfectly 
familiar, 
we 
are 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
appreciate 
the 
full 
significance 
of 
its 
growth. 
The 
deep 
and 
vital 
changes 
that 
have 
been 
effected 
in 
the 
course 
of 
its 
evolution, 
are 
recognisable 
only 
from 
the 
astounding 
narrowness 
of 
view 
with 
which 
great 
contemporary 
scientists 
have 
occasionally 
opposed 
each 
other. 
Huygens's 
wave-theory 
of 
light 
was 
incomprehensible 
to 
Newton, 
and 
Newton's 
idea 
of 
universal 
gravity 
was 
unintelligible 
to 
Huygens. 
But 
a 
century 
afterwards 
both 
notions 
were 
reconcilable, 
even 
in 
ordinary 
minds. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
original 
creations 
of 
pioneer 
intellects, 
unconsciously 
formed, 
do 
not 
assume 
a 
foreign 
garb; 
their 
form 
is 
their 
own. 
In 
them, 
childlike 
simplicity 
is 
joined 
to 
the 
maturity 
of 
manhood, 
and 
they 
are 
not 
to 
be 
compared 
with 
processes 
of 
thought 
in 
the 
average 
mind. 
The 
latter 
are 
carried 
on 
as 
are 
the 
acts 
of 
persons 
in 
the 
state 
of 
mesmerism, 
where 
actions 



involuntarily 
follow 
the 
images 
which 
the 
words 
of 
other 
persons 
suggest 
to 
their 
minds. 


The 
ideas 
that 
have 
become 
most 
familiar 
through 
long 
experience, 
are 
the 
very 
ones 
that 
intrude 
themselves 
into 
the 
conception 
of 
every 
new 
fact 
observed. 
In 
every 
instance, 
thus, 
they 
become 
involved 
in 
a 
struggle 
for 
self-
preservation, 
and 
it 
is 
just 
they 
that 
are 
seized 
by 
the 
inevitable 
process 
of 
transformation. 


Upon 
this 
process 
rests 
substantially 
the 
method 
of 
explaining 
by 
hypothesis 
new 
and 
uncomprehended 
phenomena. 
Thus, 
instead 
of 
forming 
entirely 
new 
notions 
to 
explain 
the 
movements 
of 
the 
heavenly 
bodies 
and 
the 
phenomena 
of 
the 
tides, 
we 
imagine 
the 
material 
particles 
composing 
the 
bodies 
of 
the 
universe 
to 
possess 
weight 
or 
gravity 
with 
respect 
to 
one 
another. 
Similarly, 
we 
imagine 
electrified 
bodies 
to 
be 
freighted 
with 
fluids 
that 
attract 
and 
repel, 
or 
we 
conceive 
the 
space 
between 
them 
to 
be 
in 
a 
state 
of 
elastic 
tension. 
In 
so 
doing, 
we 
substitute 
for 
new 
ideas 
distinct 
and 
more 
familiar 
notions 
of 
old 
experience—notions 
which 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
run 
unimpeded 
in 
their 
courses, 
although 
they 
too 
must 
suffer 
partial 
transformation. 


The 
animal 
cannot 
construct 
new 
members 
to 
perform 
every 
new 
function 
that 
circumstances 
and 
fate 
demand 
of 
it. 
On 
the 
contrary 
it 
is 
obliged 
to 
make 
use 
of 
those 
it 
already 
possesses. 
When 
a 
vertebrate 
animal 
chances 
into 
an 
environment 
where 
it 
must 
learn 
to 
fly 
or 
swim, 
an 
additional 
pair 
of 
extremities 
is 
not 
grown 
for 
the 
purpose. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
animal 
must 
adapt 
and 
transform 
a 
pair 
that 
it 
already 
has. 


The 
construction 
of 
hypotheses, 
therefore, 
is 
not 
the 
product 
of 
artificial 
scientific 
methods. 
This 
process 
is 
unconsciously 
carried 
on 
in 
the 
very 
infancy 
of 
science. 
Even 
later, 
hypotheses 
do 
not 
become 
detrimental 
and 
dangerous 
to 
progress 
except 
when 
more 
reliance 
is 
placed 
on 
them 
than 
on 
the 
facts 
themselves; 
when 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
former 
are 
more 
highly 
valued 
than 
the 
latter, 
and 
when, 
rigidly 
adhering 
to 
hypothetical 
notions, 
we 
overestimate 
the 
ideas 
we 
possess 
as 
compared 
with 
those 
we 
have 
to 
acquire. 


The 
extension 
of 
our 
sphere 
of 
experience 
always 
involves 
a 
transformation 
of 
our 
ideas. 
It 
matters 
not 
whether 
the 
face 
of 
nature 
becomes 
actually 



altered, 
presenting 
new 
and 
strange 
phenomena, 
or 
whether 
these 
phenomena 
are 
brought 
to 
light 
by 
an 
intentional 
or 
accidental 
turn 
of 
observation. 
In 
fact, 
all 
the 
varied 
methods 
of 
scientific 
inquiry 
and 
of 
purposive 
mental 
adaptation 
enumerated 
by 
John 
Stuart 
Mill, 
those 
of 
observation 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
experiment, 
are 
ultimately 
recognisable 
as 
forms 
of 
one 
fundamental 
method, 
the 
method 
of 
change, 
or 
variation. 
It 
is 
through 
change 
of 
circumstances 
that 
the 
natural 
philosopher 
learns. 
This 
process, 
however, 
is 
by 
no 
means 
confined 
to 
the 
investigator 
of 
nature. 
The 
historian, 
the 
philosopher, 
the 
jurist, 
the 
mathematician, 
the 
artist, 
the 
æsthetician, 
[77] 
all 
illuminate 
and 
unfold 
their 
ideas 
by 
producing 
from 
the 
rich 
treasures 
of 
memory 
similar, 
but 
different, 
cases; 
thus, 
they 
observe 
and 
experiment 
in 
their 
thoughts. 
Even 
if 
all 
sense-experience 
should 
suddenly 
cease, 
the 
events 
of 
the 
days 
past 
would 
meet 
in 
different 
attitudes 
in 
the 
mind 
and 
the 
process 
of 
adaptation 
would 
still 
continue—a 
process 
which, 
in 
contradistinction 
to 
the 
adaptation 
of 
thoughts 
to 
facts 
in 
practical 
spheres, 
would 
be 
strictly 
theoretical, 
being 
an 
adaptation 
of 
thoughts 
to 
thoughts. 


The 
method 
of 
change 
or 
variation 
brings 
before 
us 
like 
cases 
of 
phenomena, 
having 
partly 
the 
same 
and 
partly 
different 
elements. 
It 
is 
only 
by 
comparing 
different 
cases 
of 
refracted 
light 
at 
changing 
angles 
of 
incidence 
that 
the 
common 
factor, 
the 
constancy 
of 
the 
refractive 
index, 
is 
disclosed. 
And 
only 
by 
comparing 
the 
refractions 
of 
light 
of 
different 
colors, 
does 
the 
difference, 
the 
inequality 
of 
the 
indices 
of 
refraction, 
arrest 
the 
attention. 
Comparison 
based 
upon 
change 
leads 
the 
mind 
simultaneously 
to 
the 
highest 
abstractions 
and 
to 
the 
finest 
distinctions. 


Undoubtedly, 
the 
animal 
also 
is 
able 
to 
distinguish 
between 
the 
similar 
and 
dissimilar 
of 
two 
cases. 
Its 
consciousness 
is 
aroused 
by 
a 
noise 
or 
a 
rustling, 
and 
its 
motor 
centre 
is 
put 
in 
readiness. 
The 
sight 
of 
the 
creature 
causing 
the 
disturbance, 
will, 
according 
to 
its 
size, 
provoke 
flight 
or 
prompt 
pursuit; 
and 
in 
the 
latter 
case, 
the 
more 
exact 
distinctions 
will 
determine 
the 
mode 
of 
attack. 
But 
man 
alone 
attains 
to 
the 
faculty 
of 
voluntary 
and 
conscious 
comparison. 
Man 
alone 
can, 
by 
his 
power 
of 
abstraction, 
rise, 
in 
one 
moment, 
to 
the 
comprehension 
of 
principles 
like 
the 
conservation 
of 
mass 
or 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy, 
and 
in 
the 
next 
observe 
and 
mark 
the 
arrangement 
of 
the 
iron 
lines 
in 
the 
spectrum. 
In 
thus 
dealing 
with 
the 
objects 
of 
his 
conceptual 
life, 
his 
ideas 
unfold 
and 
expand, 
like 
his 
nervous 
system, 
into 
a 



widely 
ramified 
and 
organically 
articulated 
tree, 
on 
which 
he 
may 
follow 
every 
limb 
to 
its 
farthermost 
branches, 
and, 
when 
occasion 
demands, 
return 
to 
the 
trunk 
from 
which 
he 
started. 


The 
English 
philosopher 
Whewell 
has 
remarked 
that 
two 
things 
are 
requisite 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
science: 
facts 
and 
ideas. 
Ideas 
alone 
lead 
to 
empty 
speculation; 
mere 
facts 
can 
yield 
no 
organic 
knowledge. 
We 
see 
that 
all 
depends 
upon 
the 
capacity 
of 
adapting 
existing 
notions 
to 
fresh 
facts. 


Over-readiness 
to 
yield 
to 
every 
new 
fact 
prevents 
fixed 
habits 
of 
thought 
from 
arising. 
Excessively 
rigid 
habits 
of 
thought 
impede 
freedom 
of 
observation. 
In 
the 
struggle, 
in 
the 
compromise 
between 
judgment 
and 
prejudgment 
(prejudice), 
if 
we 
may 
use 
the 
term, 
our 
understanding 
of 
things 
broadens. 


Habitual 
judgment, 
applied 
to 
a 
new 
case 
without 
antecedent 
tests, 
we 
call 
prejudgment 
or 
prejudice. 
Who 
does 
not 
know 
its 
terrible 
power! 
But 
we 
think 
less 
often 
of 
the 
importance 
and 
utility 
of 
prejudice. 
Physically, 
no 
one 
could 
exist, 
if 
he 
had 
to 
guide 
and 
regulate 
the 
circulation, 
respiration, 
and 
digestion 
of 
his 
body 
by 
conscious 
and 
purposive 
acts. 
So, 
too, 
no 
one 
could 
exist 
intellectually 
if 
he 
had 
to 
form 
judgments 
on 
every 
passing 
experience, 
instead 
of 
allowing 
himself 
to 
be 
controlled 
by 
the 
judgments 
he 
has 
already 
formed. 
Prejudice 
is 
a 
sort 
of 
reflex 
motion 
in 
the 
province 
of 
intelligence. 


On 
prejudices, 
that 
is, 
on 
habitual 
judgments 
not 
tested 
in 
every 
case 
to 
which 
they 
are 
applied, 
reposes 
a 
goodly 
portion 
of 
the 
thought 
and 
work 
of 
the 
natural 
scientist. 
On 
prejudices 
reposes 
most 
of 
the 
conduct 
of 
society. 
With 
the 
sudden 
disappearance 
of 
prejudice 
society 
would 
hopelessly 
dissolve. 
That 
prince 
displayed 
a 
deep 
insight 
into 
the 
power 
of 
intellectual 
habit, 
who 
quelled 
the 
loud 
menaces 
and 
demands 
of 
his 
body-guard 
for 
arrears 
of 
pay 
and 
compelled 
them 
to 
turn 
about 
and 
march, 
by 
simply 
pronouncing 
the 
regular 
word 
of 
command; 
he 
well 
knew 
that 
they 
would 
be 
unable 
to 
resist 
that. 


Not 
until 
the 
discrepancy 
between 
habitual 
judgments 
and 
facts 
becomes 
great 
is 
the 
investigator 
implicated 
in 
appreciable 
illusion. 
Then 
tragic 
complications 
and 
catastrophes 
occur 
in 
the 
practical 
life 
of 
individuals 
and 
nations—crises 
where 
man, 
placing 
custom 
above 
life, 
instead 
of 
pressing 
it 



into 
the 
service 
of 
life, 
becomes 
the 
victim 
of 
his 
error. 
The 
very 
power 
which 
in 
intellectual 
life 
advances, 
fosters, 
and 
sustains 
us, 
may 
in 
other 
circumstances 
delude 
and 
destroy 
us. 


Ideas 
are 
not 
all 
of 
life. 
They 
are 
only 
momentary 
efflorescences 
of 
light, 
designed 
to 
illuminate 
the 
paths 
of 
the 
will. 
But 
as 
delicate 
reagents 
on 
our 
organic 
evolution 
our 
ideas 
are 
of 
paramount 
importance. 
No 
theory 
can 
gainsay 
the 
vital 
transformation 
which 
we 
feel 
taking 
place 
within 
us 
through 
their 
agency. 
Nor 
is 
it 
necessary 
that 
we 
should 
have 
a 
proof 
of 
this 
process. 
We 
are 
immediately 
assured 
of 
it. 


The 
transformation 
of 
ideas 
thus 
appears 
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
general 
evolution 
of 
life, 
as 
a 
part 
of 
its 
adaptation 
to 
a 
constantly 
widening 
sphere 
of 
action. 
A 
granite 
boulder 
on 
a 
mountain-side 
tends 
towards 
the 
earth 
below. 
It 
must 
abide 
in 
its 
resting-place 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
before 
its 
support 
gives 
way. 
The 
shrub 
that 
grows 
at 
its 
base 
is 
farther 
advanced; 
it 
accommodates 
itself 
to 
summer 
and 
winter. 
The 
fox 
which, 
overcoming 
the 
force 
of 
gravity, 
creeps 
to 
the 
summit 
where 
he 
has 
scented 
his 
prey, 
is 
freer 
in 
his 
movements 
than 
either. 
The 
arm 
of 
man 
reaches 
further 
still; 
and 
scarcely 
anything 
of 
note 
happens 
in 
Africa 
or 
Asia 
that 
does 
not 
leave 
an 
imprint 
upon 
his 
life. 
What 
an 
immense 
portion 
of 
the 
life 
of 
other 
men 
is 
reflected 
in 
ourselves; 
their 
joys, 
their 
affections, 
their 
happiness 
and 
misery! 
And 
this 
too, 
when 
we 
survey 
only 
our 
immediate 
surroundings, 
and 
confine 
our 
attention 
to 
modern 
literature. 
How 
much 
more 
do 
we 
experience 
when 
we 
travel 
through 
ancient 
Egypt 
with 
Herodotus, 
when 
we 
stroll 
through 
the 
streets 
of 
Pompeii, 
when 
we 
carry 
ourselves 
back 
to 
the 
gloomy 
period 
of 
the 
crusades 
or 
to 
the 
golden 
age 
of 
Italian 
art, 
now 
making 
the 
acquaintance 
of 
a 
physician 
of 
Molière, 
and 
now 
that 
of 
a 
Diderot 
or 
of 
a 
D'Alembert. 
What 
a 
great 
part 
of 
the 
life 
of 
others, 
of 
their 
character 
and 
their 
purpose, 
do 
we 
not 
absorb 
through 
poetry 
and 
music! 
And 
although 
they 
only 
gently 
touch 
the 
chords 
of 
our 
emotions, 
like 
the 
memory 
of 
youth 
softly 
breathing 
upon 
the 
spirit 
of 
an 
aged 
man, 
we 
have 
nevertheless 
lived 
them 
over 
again 
in 
part. 
How 
great 
and 
comprehensive 
does 
self 
become 
in 
this 
conception; 
and 
how 
insignificant 
the 
person! 
Egoistical 
systems 
both 
of 
optimism 
and 
pessimism 
perish 
with 
their 
narrow 
standard 
of 
the 
import 
of 
intellectual 
life. 
We 
feel 
that 
the 
real 
pearls 
of 
life 
lie 
in 
the 
ever 
changing 
contents 
of 
consciousness, 
and 
that 
the 



person 
is 
merely 
an 
indifferent 
symbolical 
thread 
on 
which 
they 
are 
strung. 


[78] 


We 
are 
prepared, 
thus, 
to 
regard 
ourselves 
and 
every 
one 
of 
our 
ideas 
as 
a 
product 
and 
a 
subject 
of 
universal 
evolution; 
and 
in 
this 
way 
we 
shall 
advance 
sturdily 
and 
unimpeded 
along 
the 
paths 
which 
the 
future 
will 
throw 
open 
to 
us.

ON 
THE 
PRINCIPLE 
OF 
COMPARISON 
IN 
PHYSICS. 
[80] 


Twenty 
years 
ago 
when 
Kirchhoff 
defined 
the 
object 
of 
mechanics 
as 
the 
"description, 
in 
complete 
and 
very 
simple 
terms, 
of 
the 
motions 
occurring 
in 
nature," 
he 
produced 
by 
the 
statement 
a 
peculiar 
impression. 
Fourteen 
years 
subsequently, 
Boltzmann, 
in 
the 
life-like 
picture 
which 
he 
drew 
of 
the 
great 
inquirer, 
could 
still 
speak 
of 
the 
universal 
astonishment 
at 
this 
novel 
method 
of 
treating 
mechanics, 
and 
we 
meet 
with 
epistemological 
treatises 
to-day, 
which 
plainly 
show 
how 
difficult 
is 
the 
acceptance 
of 
this 
point 
of 
view. 
A 
modest 
and 
small 
band 
of 
inquirers 
there 
were, 
however, 
to 
whom 
Kirchhoff's 
few 
words 
were 
tidings 
of 
a 
welcome 
and 
powerful 
ally 
in 
the 
epistemological 
field. 


Now, 
how 
does 
it 
happen 
that 
we 
yield 
our 
assent 
so 
reluctantly 
to 
the 
philosophical 
opinion 
of 
an 
inquirer 
for 
whose 
scientific 
achievements 
we 
have 
only 
words 
of 
praise? 
One 
reason 
probably 
is 
that 
few 
inquirers 
can 
find 
time 
and 
leisure, 
amid 
the 
exacting 
employments 
demanded 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
new 
knowledge, 
to 
inquire 
closely 
into 
that 
tremendous 
psychical 
process 
by 
which 
science 
is 
formed. 
Further, 
it 
is 
inevitable 
that 
much 
should 
be 
put 
into 
Kirchhoff's 
rigid 
words 
that 
they 
were 
not 
originally 
intended 
to 
convey, 
and 
that 
much 
should 
be 
found 
wanting 
in 
them 
that 
had 
always 
been 
regarded 
as 
an 
essential 
element 
of 
scientific 
knowledge. 
What 
can 
mere 
description 
accomplish? 
What 
has 
become 
of 
explanation, 
of 
our 
insight 
into 
the 
causal 
connexion 
of 
things? 


Permit 
me, 
for 
a 
moment, 
to 
contemplate 
not 
the 
results 
of 
science, 
but 
the 
mode 
of 
its 
growth, 
in 
a 
frank 
and 
unbiassed 
manner. 
We 
know 
of 
only 
one 
source 
of 
immediate 
revelation 
of 
scientific 
facts—our 
senses. 
Restricted 
to 
this 
source 
alone, 
thrown 
wholly 
upon 
his 
own 
resources, 
obliged 
to 
start 
always 
anew, 
what 
could 
the 
isolated 
individual 
accomplish? 
Of 
a 
stock 
of 
knowledge 
so 
acquired 
the 
science 
of 
a 
distant 
negro 
hamlet 
in 
darkest 
Africa 
could 
hardly 
give 
us 
a 
sufficiently 
humiliating 
conception. 
For 
there 
that 



veritable 
miracle 
of 
thought-transference 
has 
already 
begun 
its 
work, 
compared 
with 
which 
the 
miracles 
of 
the 
spiritualists 
are 
rank 
monstrosities 
—communication 
by 
language. 
Reflect, 
too, 
that 
by 
means 
of 
the 
magical 
characters 
which 
our 
libraries 
contain 
we 
can 
raise 
the 
spirits 
of 
the 
"the 
sovereign 
dead 
of 
old" 
from 
Faraday 
to 
Galileo 
and 
Archimedes, 
through 
ages 
of 
time—spirits 
who 
do 
not 
dismiss 
us 
with 
ambiguous 
and 
derisive 
oracles, 
but 
tell 
us 
the 
best 
they 
know; 
then 
shall 
we 
feel 
what 
a 
stupendous 
and 
indispensable 
factor 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
science 
communication 
is. 
Not 
the 
dim, 
half-conscious 
surmises 
of 
the 
acute 
observer 
of 
nature 
or 
critic 
of 
humanity 
belong 
to 
science, 
but 
only 
that 
which 
they 
possess 
clearly 
enough 
to 
communicate 
to 
others. 


But 
how, 
now, 
do 
we 
go 
about 
this 
communication 
of 
a 
newly 
acquired 
experience, 
of 
a 
newly 
observed 
fact? 
As 
the 
different 
calls 
and 
battle-cries 
of 
gregarious 
animals 
are 
unconsciously 
formed 
signs 
for 
a 
common 
observation 
or 
action, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
causes 
which 
produce 
such 
action— 
a 
fact 
that 
already 
involves 
the 
germ 
of 
the 
concept; 
so 
also 
the 
words 
of 
human 
language, 
which 
is 
only 
more 
highly 
specialised, 
are 
names 
or 
signs 
for 
universally 
known 
facts, 
which 
all 
can 
observe 
or 
have 
observed. 
If 
the 
mental 
representation, 
accordingly, 
follows 
the 
new 
fact 
at 
once 
and 
passively, 
then 
that 
new 
fact 
must, 
of 
itself, 
immediately 
be 
constituted 
and 
represented 
in 
thought 
by 
facts 
already 
universally 
known 
and 
commonly 
observed. 
Memory 
is 
always 
ready 
to 
put 
forward 
for 
comparison 
known 
facts 
which 
resemble 
the 
new 
event, 
or 
agree 
with 
it 
in 
certain 
features, 
and 
so 
renders 
possible 
that 
elementary 
internal 
judgment 
which 
the 
mature 
and 
definitively 
formulated 
judgment 
soon 
follows. 


Comparison, 
as 
the 
fundamental 
condition 
of 
communication, 
is 
the 
most 
powerful 
inner 
vital 
element 
of 
science. 
The 
zoölogist 
sees 
in 
the 
bones 
of 
the 
wing-membranes 
of 
bats, 
fingers; 
he 
compares 
the 
bones 
of 
the 
cranium 
with 
the 
vertebræ, 
the 
embryos 
of 
different 
organisms 
with 
one 
another, 
and 
the 
different 
stages 
of 
development 
of 
the 
same 
organism 
with 
one 
another. 
The 
geographer 
sees 
in 
Lake 
Garda 
a 
fjord, 
in 
the 
Sea 
of 
Aral 
a 
lake 
in 
process 
of 
drying 
up. 
The 
philologist 
compares 
different 
languages 
with 
one 
another, 
and 
the 
formations 
of 
the 
same 
language 
as 
well. 
If 
it 
is 
not 
customary 
to 
speak 
of 
comparative 
physics 
in 
the 
same 
sense 
that 
we 
speak 
of 
comparative 
anatomy, 
the 
reason 
is 
that 
in 
a 
science 
of 
such 
great 
experimental 
activity 
the 



attention 
is 
turned 
away 
too 
much 
from 
the 
contemplative 
element. 
But 
like 
all 
other 
sciences, 
physics 
lives 
and 
grows 
by 
comparison. 


The 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
result 
of 
the 
comparison 
finds 
expression 
in 
the 
communication, 
varies 
of 
course 
very 
much. 
When 
we 
say 
that 
the 
colors 
of 
the 
spectrum 
are 
red, 
yellow, 
green, 
blue, 
and 
violet, 
the 
designations 
employed 
may 
possibly 
have 
been 
derived 
from 
the 
technology 
of 
tattooing, 
or 
they 
may 
subsequently 
have 
acquired 
the 
significance 
of 
standing 
for 
the 
colors 
of 
the 
rose, 
the 
lemon, 
the 
leaf, 
the 
corn-flower, 
and 
the 
violet. 
From 
the 
frequent 
repetition 
of 
such 
comparisons, 
however, 
made 
under 
the 
most 
manifold 
circumstances, 
the 
inconstant 
features, 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
permanent 
congruent 
features, 
get 
so 
obliterated 
that 
the 
latter 
acquire 
a 
fixed 
significance 
independent 
of 
every 
object 
and 
connexion, 
or 
take 
on 
as 
we 
say 
an 
abstract 
or 
conceptual 
import. 
No 
one 
thinks 
at 
the 
word 
"red" 
of 
any 
other 
agreement 
with 
the 
rose 
than 
that 
of 
color, 
or 
at 
the 
word 
"straight" 
of 
any 
other 
property 
of 
a 
stretched 
cord 
than 
the 
sameness 
of 
direction. 
Just 
so, 
too, 
numbers, 
originally 
the 
names 
of 
the 
fingers 
of 
the 
hands 
and 
feet, 
from 
being 
used 
as 
arrangement-signs 
for 
all 
kinds 
of 
objects, 
were 
lifted 
to 
the 
plane 
of 
abstract 
concepts. 
A 
verbal 
report 
(communication) 
of 
a 
fact 
that 
uses 
only 
these 
purely 
abstract 
implements, 
we 
call 
a 
direct 
description. 


The 
direct 
description 
of 
a 
fact 
of 
any 
great 
extent 
is 
an 
irksome 
task, 
even 
where 
the 
requisite 
notions 
are 
already 
completely 
developed. 
What 
a 
simplification 
it 
involves 
if 
we 
can 
say, 
the 
fact 
A 
now 
considered 
comports 
itself, 
not 
in 
one, 
but 
in 
many 
or 
in 
all 
its 
features, 
like 
an 
old 
and 
well-known 
fact 
B. 
The 
moon 
comports 
itself 
as 
a 
heavy 
body 
does 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
earth; 
light 
like 
a 
wave-motion 
or 
an 
electric 
vibration; 
a 
magnet, 
as 
if 
it 
were 
laden 
with 
gravitating 
fluids, 
and 
so 
on. 
We 
call 
such 
a 
description, 
in 
which 
we 
appeal, 
as 
it 
were, 
to 
a 
description 
already 
and 
elsewhere 
formulated, 
or 
perhaps 
still 
to 
be 
precisely 
formulated, 
an 
indirect 
description. 
We 
are 
at 
liberty 
to 
supplement 
this 
description, 
gradually, 
by 
direct 
description, 
to 
correct 
it, 
or 
to 
replace 
it 
altogether. 
We 
see, 
thus, 
without 
difficulty, 
that 
what 
is 
called 
a 
theory 
or 
a 
theoretical 
idea, 
falls 
under 
the 
category 
of 
what 
is 
here 
termed 
indirect 
description. 



What, 
now, 
is 
a 
theoretical 
idea? 
Whence 
do 
we 
get 
it? 
What 
does 
it 
accomplish 
for 
us? 
Why 
does 
it 
occupy 
a 
higher 
place 
in 
our 
judgment 
than 
the 
mere 
holding 
fast 
to 
a 
fact 
or 
an 
observation? 
Here, 
too, 
memory 
and 
comparison 
alone 
are 
in 
play. 
But 
instead 
of 
a 
single 
feature 
of 
resemblance 
culled 
from 
memory, 
in 
this 
case 
a 
great 
system 
of 
resemblances 
confronts 
us, 
a 
well-known 
physiognomy, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
the 
new 
fact 
is 
immediately 
transformed 
into 
an 
old 
acquaintance. 
Besides, 
it 
is 
in 
the 
power 
of 
the 
idea 
to 
offer 
us 
more 
than 
we 
actually 
see 
in 
the 
new 
fact, 
at 
the 
first 
moment; 
it 
can 
extend 
the 
fact, 
and 
enrich 
it 
with 
features 
which 
we 
are 
first 
induced 
to 
seek 
from 
such 
suggestions, 
and 
which 
are 
often 
actually 
found. 
It 
is 
this 
rapidity 
in 
extending 
knowledge 
that 
gives 
to 
theory 
a 
preference 
over 
simple 
observation. 
But 
that 
preference 
is 
wholly 
quantitative. 
Qualitatively, 
and 
in 
real 
essential 
points, 
theory 
differs 
from 
observation 
neither 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
its 
origin 
nor 
in 
its 
last 
results. 


The 
adoption 
of 
a 
theory, 
however, 
always 
involves 
a 
danger. 
For 
a 
theory 
puts 
in 
the 
place 
of 
a 
fact 
A 
in 
thought, 
always 
a 
different, 
but 
simpler 
and 
more 
familiar 
fact 
B, 
which 
in 
some 
relations 
can 
mentally 
represent 
A, 
but 
for 
the 
very 
reason 
that 
it 
is 
different, 
in 
other 
relations 
cannot 
represent 
it. 
If 
now, 
as 
may 
readily 
happen, 
sufficient 
care 
is 
not 
exercised, 
the 
most 
fruitful 
theory 
may, 
in 
special 
circumstances, 
become 
a 
downright 
obstacle 
to 
inquiry. 
Thus, 
the 
emission-theory 
of 
light, 
in 
accustoming 
the 
physicist 
to 
think 
of 
the 
projectile 
path 
of 
the 
"light-particles" 
as 
an 
undifferentiated 
straight-line, 
demonstrably 
impeded 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
periodicity 
of 
light. 
By 
putting 
in 
the 
place 
of 
light 
the 
more 
familiar 
phenomena 
of 
sound, 
Huygens 
renders 
light 
in 
many 
of 
its 
features 
a 
familiar 
event, 
but 
with 
respect 
to 
polarisation, 
which 
lacks 
the 
longitudinal 
waves 
with 
which 
alone 
he 
was 
acquainted, 
it 
had 
for 
him 
a 
doubly 
strange 
aspect. 
He 
is 
unable 
thus 
to 
grasp 
in 
abstract 
thought 
the 
fact 
of 
polarisation, 
which 
is 
before 
his 
eyes, 
whilst 
Newton, 
merely 
by 
adapting 
to 
the 
observation 
his 
thoughts, 
and 
putting 
this 
question, 
"Annon 
radiorum 
luminis 
diversa 
sunt 
latera?" 
abstractly 
grasped 
polarisation, 
that 
is, 
directly 
described 
it, 
a 
century 
before 
Malus. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
the 
agreement 
of 
the 
fact 
with 
the 
idea 
theoretically 
representing 
it, 
extends 
further 
than 
its 
inventor 
originally 
anticipated, 
then 
we 
may 
be 
led 
by 
it 
to 
unexpected 
discoveries, 
of 
which 
conical 
refraction, 
circular 
polarisation 
by 
total 
reflexion, 
Hertz's 
waves 
offer 
ready 
examples, 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
illustrations 
given 
above. 



Our 
insight 
into 
the 
conditions 
indicated 
will 
be 
improved, 
perhaps, 
by 
contemplating 
the 
development 
of 
some 
theory 
or 
other 
more 
in 
detail. 
Let 
us 
consider 
a 
magnetised 
bar 
of 
steel 
by 
the 
side 
of 
a 
second 
unmagnetised 
bar, 
in 
all 
other 
respects 
the 
same. 
The 
second 
bar 
gives 
no 
indication 
of 
the 
presence 
of 
iron-filings; 
the 
first 
attracts 
them. 
Also, 
when 
the 
iron-filings 
are 
absent, 
we 
must 
think 
of 
the 
magnetised 
bar 
as 
in 
a 
different 
condition 
from 
that 
of 
the 
unmagnetised. 
For, 
that 
the 
mere 
presence 
of 
the 
iron-filings 
does 
not 
induce 
the 
phenomenon 
of 
attraction 
is 
proved 
by 
the 
second 
unmagnetised 
bar. 
The 
ingenuous 
man, 
who 
finds 
in 
his 
will, 
as 
his 
most 
familiar 
source 
of 
power, 
the 
best 
facilities 
for 
comparison, 
conceives 
a 
species 
of 
spirit 
in 
the 
magnet. 
The 
behavior 
of 
a 
warm 
body 
or 
of 
an 
electrified 
body 
suggests 
similar 
ideas. 
This 
is 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
oldest 
theory, 
fetishism, 
which 
the 
inquirers 
of 
the 
early 
Middle 
Ages 
had 
not 
yet 
overcome, 
and 
which 
in 
its 
last 
vestiges, 
in 
the 
conception 
of 
forces, 
still 
flourishes 
in 
modern 
physics. 
We 
see, 
thus, 
the 
dramatic 
element 
need 
no 
more 
be 
absent 
in 
a 
scientific 
description, 
than 
in 
a 
thrilling 
novel. 


If, 
on 
subsequent 
examination, 
it 
be 
observed 
that 
a 
cold 
body, 
in 
contact 
with 
a 
hot 
body, 
warms 
itself, 
so 
to 
speak, 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
hot 
body; 
further, 
that 
when 
the 
substances 
are 
the 
same, 
the 
cold 
body, 
which, 
let 
us 
say, 
has 
twice 
the 
mass 
of 
the 
other, 
gains 
only 
half 
the 
number 
of 
degrees 
of 
temperature 
that 
the 
other 
loses, 
a 
wholly 
new 
impression 
arises. 
The 
demoniac 
character 
of 
the 
event 
vanishes, 
for 
the 
supposed 
spirit 
acts 
not 
by 
caprice, 
but 
according 
to 
fixed 
laws. 
In 
its 
place, 
however, 
instinctively 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
substance 
is 
substituted, 
part 
of 
which 
flows 
over 
from 
the 
one 
body 
to 
the 
other, 
but 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
which, 
representable 
by 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
products 
of 
the 
masses 
into 
the 
respective 
changes 
of 
temperature, 
remains 
constant. 
Black 
was 
the 
first 
to 
be 
powerfully 
struck 
with 
this 
resemblance 
of 
thermal 
processes 
to 
the 
motion 
of 
a 
substance, 
and 
under 
its 
guidance 
discovered 
the 
specific 
heat, 
the 
heat 
of 
fusion, 
and 
the 
heat 
of 
vaporisation 
of 
bodies. 
Gaining 
strength 
and 
fixity, 
however, 
from 
these 
successes, 
this 
notion 
of 
substance 
subsequently 
stood 
in 
the 
way 
of 
scientific 
advancement. 
It 
blinded 
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
successors 
of 
Black, 
and 
prevented 
them 
from 
seeing 
the 
manifest 
fact, 
which 
every 
savage 
knows, 
that 
heat 
is 
produced 
by 
friction. 
Fruitful 
as 
that 
notion 
was 
for 
Black, 
helpful 
as 
it 
still 
is 
to 
the 
learner 
to-day 
in 
Black's 
special 
field, 
permanent 
and 
universal 
validity 
as 
a 
theory 
it 
could 
never 
maintain. 
But 
what 
is 
essential, 
conceptually, 
in 
it, 



viz., 
the 
constancy 
of 
the 
product-sum 
above 
mentioned, 
retains 
its 
value 
and 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
direct 
description 
of 
Black's 
facts. 


It 
stands 
to 
reason 
that 
those 
theories 
which 
push 
themselves 
forward 
unsought, 
instinctively, 
and 
wholly 
of 
their 
own 
accord, 
should 
have 
the 
greatest 
power, 
should 
carry 
our 
thoughts 
most 
with 
them, 
and 
exhibit 
the 
staunchest 
powers 
of 
self-preservation. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
may 
also 
be 
observed 
that 
when 
critically 
scrutinised 
such 
theories 
are 
extremely 
apt 
to 
lose 
their 
cogency. 
We 
are 
constantly 
busied 
with 
"substance," 
its 
modes 
of 
action 
have 
stamped 
themselves 
indelibly 
upon 
our 
thoughts, 
our 
vividest 
and 
clearest 
reminiscences 
are 
associated 
with 
it. 
It 
should 
cause 
us 
no 
surprise, 
therefore, 
that 
Robert 
Mayer 
and 
Joule, 
who 
gave 
the 
final 
blow 
to 
Black's 
substantial 
conception 
of 
heat, 
should 
have 
re-introduced 
the 
same 
notion 
of 
substance 
in 
a 
more 
abstract 
and 
modified 
form, 
only 
applying 
to 
a 
much 
more 
extensive 
field. 


Here, 
too, 
the 
psychological 
circumstances 
which 
impart 
to 
the 
new 
conception 
its 
power, 
lie 
clearly 
before 
us. 
By 
the 
unusual 
redness 
of 
the 
venous 
blood 
in 
tropical 
climates 
Mayer's 
attention 
is 
directed 
to 
the 
lessened 
expenditure 
of 
internal 
heat 
and 
to 
the 
proportionately 
lessened 
consumption 
of 
material 
by 
the 
human 
body 
in 
those 
climates. 
But 
as 
every 
effort 
of 
the 
human 
organism, 
including 
its 
mechanical 
work, 
is 
connected 
with 
the 
consumption 
of 
material, 
and 
as 
work 
by 
friction 
can 
engender 
heat, 
therefore 
heat 
and 
work 
appear 
in 
kind 
equivalent, 
and 
between 
them 
a 
proportional 
relation 
must 
subsist. 
Not 
every 
quantity, 
but 
the 
appropriately 
calculated 
sum 
of 
the 
two, 
as 
connected 
with 
a 
proportionate 
consumption 
of 
material, 
appears 
substantial. 


By 
exactly 
similar 
considerations, 
relative 
to 
the 
economy 
of 
the 
galvanic 
element, 
Joule 
arrived 
at 
his 
view; 
he 
found 
experimentally 
that 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
heat 
evolved 
in 
the 
circuit, 
of 
the 
heat 
consumed 
in 
the 
combustion 
of 
the 
gas 
developed, 
of 
the 
electro-magnetic 
work 
of 
the 
current, 
properly 
calculated,—in 
short, 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
battery,—is 
connected 
with 
a 
proportionate 
consumption 
of 
zinc. 
Accordingly, 
this 
sum 
itself 
has 
a 
substantial 
character. 


Mayer 
was 
so 
absorbed 
with 
the 
view 
attained, 
that 
the 
indestructibility 
of 
force, 
in 
our 
phraseology 
work, 
appeared 
to 
him 
a 
priori 
evident. 
"The 



creation 
or 
annihilation 
of 
a 
force," 
he 
says, 
"lies 
without 
the 
province 
of 
human 
thought 
and 
power." 
Joule 
expressed 
himself 
to 
a 
similar 
effect: 
"It 
is 
manifestly 
absurd 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
powers 
with 
which 
God 
has 
endowed 
matter 
can 
be 
destroyed." 
Strange 
to 
say, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
such 
utterances, 
not 
Joule, 
but 
Mayer, 
was 
stamped 
as 
a 
metaphysician. 
We 
may 
be 
sure, 
however, 
that 
both 
men 
were 
merely 
giving 
expression, 
and 
that 
half-
unconsciously, 
to 
a 
powerful 
formal 
need 
of 
the 
new 
simple 
view, 
and 
that 
both 
would 
have 
been 
extremely 
surprised 
if 
it 
had 
been 
proposed 
to 
them 
that 
their 
principle 
should 
be 
submitted 
to 
a 
philosophical 
congress 
or 
ecclesiastical 
synod 
for 
a 
decision 
upon 
its 
validity. 
But 
with 
all 
agreements, 
the 
attitude 
of 
these 
two 
men, 
in 
other 
respects, 
was 
totally 
different. 
Whilst 
Mayer 
represented 
this 
formal 
need 
with 
all 
the 
stupendous 
instinctive 
force 
of 
genius, 
we 
might 
say 
almost 
with 
the 
ardor 
of 
fanaticism, 
yet 
was 
withal 
not 
wanting 
in 
the 
conceptive 
ability 
to 
compute, 
prior 
to 
all 
other 
inquirers, 
the 
mechanical 
equivalent 
of 
heat 
from 
old 
physical 
constants 
long 
known 
and 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
all, 
and 
so 
to 
set 
up 
for 
the 
new 
doctrine 
a 
programme 
embracing 
all 
physics 
and 
physiology; 
Joule, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
applied 
himself 
to 
the 
exact 
verification 
of 
the 
doctrine 
by 
beautifully 
conceived 
and 
masterfully 
executed 
experiments, 
extending 
over 
all 
departments 
of 
physics. 
Soon 
Helmholtz 
too 
attacked 
the 
problem, 
in 
a 
totally 
independent 
and 
characteristic 
manner. 
After 
the 
professional 
virtuosity 
with 
which 
this 
physicist 
grasped 
and 
disposed 
of 
all 
the 
points 
unsettled 
by 
Mayer's 
programme 
and 
more 
besides, 
what 
especially 
strikes 
us 
is 
the 
consummate 
critical 
lucidity 
of 
this 
young 
man 
of 
twenty-six 
years. 
In 
his 
exposition 
is 
wanting 
that 
vehemence 
and 
impetuosity 
which 
marked 
Mayer's. 
The 
principle 
of 
the 
conservation 
of 
energy 
is 
no 
self-evident 
or 
a 
priori 
proposition 
for 
him. 
What 
follows, 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
that 
proposition 
obtains? 
In 
this 
hypothetical 
form, 
he 
subjugates 
his 
matter. 


I 
must 
confess, 
I 
have 
always 
marvelled 
at 
the 
æsthetic 
and 
ethical 
taste 
of 
many 
of 
our 
contemporaries 
who 
have 
managed 
to 
fabricate 
out 
of 
this 
relation 
of 
things, 
odious 
national 
and 
personal 
questions, 
instead 
of 
praising 
the 
good 
fortune 
that 
made 
several 
such 
men 
work 
together 
and 
of 
rejoicing 
at 
the 
instructive 
diversity 
and 
idiosyncrasies 
of 
great 
minds 
fraught 
with 
such 
rich 
consequences 
for 
us. 


We 
know 
that 
still 
another 
theoretical 
conception 
played 
a 
part 
in 
the 



development 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
energy, 
which 
Mayer 
held 
aloof 
from, 
namely, 
the 
conception 
that 
heat, 
as 
also 
the 
other 
physical 
processes, 
are 
due 
to 
motion. 
But 
once 
the 
principle 
of 
energy 
has 
been 
reached, 
these 
auxiliary 
and 
transitional 
theories 
discharge 
no 
essential 
function, 
and 
we 
may 
regard 
the 
principle, 
like 
that 
which 
Black 
gave, 
as 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
direct 
description 
of 
a 
widely 
extended 
domain 
of 
facts. 


It 
would 
appear 
from 
such 
considerations 
not 
only 
advisable, 
but 
even 
necessary, 
with 
all 
due 
recognition 
of 
the 
helpfulness 
of 
theoretic 
ideas 
in 
research, 
yet 
gradually, 
as 
the 
new 
facts 
grow 
familiar, 
to 
substitute 
for 
indirect 
description 
direct 
description, 
which 
contains 
nothing 
that 
is 
unessential 
and 
restricts 
itself 
absolutely 
to 
the 
abstract 
apprehension 
of 
facts. 
We 
might 
almost 
say, 
that 
the 
descriptive 
sciences, 
so 
called 
with 
a 
tincture 
of 
condescension, 
have, 
in 
respect 
of 
scientific 
character, 
outstripped 
the 
physical 
expositions 
lately 
in 
vogue. 
Of 
course, 
a 
virtue 
has 
been 
made 
of 
necessity 
here. 


We 
must 
admit, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
in 
our 
power 
to 
describe 
directly 
every 
fact, 
on 
the 
moment. 
Indeed, 
we 
should 
succumb 
in 
utter 
despair 
if 
the 
whole 
wealth 
of 
facts 
which 
we 
come 
step 
by 
step 
to 
know, 
were 
presented 
to 
us 
all 
at 
once. 
Happily, 
only 
detached 
and 
unusual 
features 
first 
strike 
us, 
and 
such 
we 
bring 
nearer 
to 
ourselves 
by 
comparison 
with 
every-day 
events. 
Here 
the 
notions 
of 
the 
common 
speech 
are 
first 
developed. 
The 
comparisons 
then 
grow 
more 
manifold 
and 
numerous, 
the 
fields 
of 
facts 
compared 
more 
extensive, 
the 
concepts 
that 
make 
direct 
description 
possible, 
proportionately 
more 
general 
and 
more 
abstract. 


First 
we 
become 
familiar 
with 
the 
motion 
of 
freely 
falling 
bodies. 
The 
concepts 
of 
force, 
mass, 
and 
work 
are 
then 
carried 
over, 
with 
appropriate 
modifications, 
to 
the 
phenomena 
of 
electricity 
and 
magnetism. 
A 
stream 
of 
water 
is 
said 
to 
have 
suggested 
to 
Fourier 
the 
first 
distinct 
picture 
of 
currents 
of 
heat. 
A 
special 
case 
of 
vibrations 
of 
strings 
investigated 
by 
Taylor, 
cleared 
up 
for 
him 
a 
special 
case 
of 
the 
conduction 
of 
heat. 
Much 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
Daniel 
Bernoulli 
and 
Euler 
constructed 
the 
most 
diverse 
forms 
of 
vibrations 
of 
strings 
from 
Taylor's 
cases, 
so 
Fourier 
constructs 
out 
of 
simple 
cases 
of 
conduction 
the 
most 
multifarious 
motions 
of 
heat; 
and 
that 
method 
has 
extended 
itself 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
physics. 
Ohm 
forms 
his 
conception 
of 



the 
electric 
current 
in 
imitation 
of 
Fourier's. 
The 
latter, 
also, 
adopts 
Fick's 
theory 
of 
diffusion. 
In 
an 
analogous 
manner 
a 
conception 
of 
the 
magnetic 
current 
is 
developed. 
All 
sorts 
of 
stationary 
currents 
are 
thus 
made 
to 
exhibit 
common 
features, 
and 
even 
the 
condition 
of 
complete 
equilibrium 
in 
an 
extended 
medium 
shares 
these 
features 
with 
the 
dynamical 
condition 
of 
equilibrium 
of 
a 
stationary 
current. 
Things 
as 
remote 
as 
the 
magnetic 
lines 
of 
force 
of 
an 
electric 
current 
and 
the 
stream-lines 
of 
a 
frictionless 
liquid 
vortex 
enter 
in 
this 
way 
into 
a 
peculiar 
relationship 
of 
similarity. 
The 
concept 
of 
potential, 
originally 
enunciated 
for 
a 
restricted 
province, 
acquires 
a 
wide-
reaching 
applicability. 
Things 
as 
dissimilar 
as 
pressure, 
temperature, 
and 
electromotive 
force, 
now 
show 
points 
of 
agreement 
in 
relation 
to 
ideas 
derived 
by 
definite 
methods 
from 
that 
concept: 
viz., 
fall 
of 
pressure, 
fall 
of 
temperature, 
fall 
of 
potential, 
as 
also 
with 
the 
further 
notions 
of 
liquid, 
thermal, 
and 
electric 
strength 
of 
current. 
That 
relationship 
between 
systems 
of 
ideas 
in 
which 
the 
dissimilarity 
of 
every 
two 
homologous 
concepts 
as 
well 
as 
the 
agreement 
in 
logical 
relations 
of 
every 
two 
homologous 
pairs 
of 
concepts, 
is 
clearly 
brought 
to 
light, 
is 
called 
an 
analogy. 
It 
is 
an 
effective 
means 
of 
mastering 
heterogeneous 
fields 
of 
facts 
in 
unitary 
comprehension. 
The 
path 
is 
plainly 
shown 
in 
which 
a 
universal 
physical 
phenomenology 
embracing 
all 
domains, 
will 
be 
developed. 


In 
the 
process 
described 
we 
attain 
for 
the 
first 
time 
to 
what 
is 
indispensable 
in 
the 
direct 
description 
of 
broad 
fields 
of 
fact—the 
wide-reaching 
abstract 
concept. 
And 
now 
I 
must 
put 
a 
question 
smacking 
of 
the 
school-master, 
but 
unavoidable: 
What 
is 
a 
concept? 
Is 
it 
a 
hazy 
representation, 
admitting 
withal 
of 
mental 
visualisation? 
No. 
Mental 
visualisation 
accompanies 
it 
only 
in 
the 
simplest 
cases, 
and 
then 
merely 
as 
an 
adjunct. 
Think, 
for 
example, 
of 
the 
"coefficient 
of 
self-induction," 
and 
seek 
for 
its 
visualised 
mental 
image. 
Or 
is, 
perhaps, 
the 
concept 
a 
mere 
word? 
The 
adoption 
of 
this 
forlorn 
idea, 
which 
has 
been 
actually 
proposed 
of 
late 
by 
a 
reputed 
mathematician 
would 
only 
throw 
us 
back 
a 
thousand 
years 
into 
the 
deepest 
scholasticism. 
We 
must, 
therefore, 
reject 
it. 


The 
solution 
is 
not 
far 
to 
seek. 
We 
must 
not 
think 
that 
sensation, 
or 
representation, 
is 
a 
purely 
passive 
process. 
The 
lowest 
organisms 
respond 
to 
it 
with 
a 
simple 
reflex 
motion, 
by 
engulfing 
the 
prey 
which 
approaches 
them. 
In 
higher 
organisms 
the 
centripetal 
stimulus 
encounters 
in 
the 
nervous 
system 



obstacles 
and 
aids 
which 
modify 
the 
centrifugal 
process. 
In 
still 
higher 
organisms, 
where 
prey 
is 
pursued 
and 
examined, 
the 
process 
in 
question 
may 
go 
through 
extensive 
paths 
of 
circular 
motions 
before 
it 
comes 
to 
relative 
rest. 
Our 
own 
life, 
too, 
is 
enacted 
in 
such 
processes; 
all 
that 
we 
call 
science 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
parts, 
or 
middle 
terms, 
of 
such 
activities. 


It 
will 
not 
surprise 
us 
now 
if 
I 
say: 
the 
definition 
of 
a 
concept, 
and, 
when 
it 
is 
very 
familiar, 
even 
its 
name, 
is 
an 
impulse 
to 
some 
accurately 
determined, 
often 
complicated, 
critical, 
comparative, 
or 
constructive 
activity, 
the 
usually 
sense-perceptive 
result 
of 
which 
is 
a 
term 
or 
member 
of 
the 
concept's 
scope. 
It 
matters 
not 
whether 
the 
concept 
draws 
the 
attention 
only 
to 
one 
certain 
sense 
(as 
sight) 
or 
to 
a 
phase 
of 
a 
sense 
(as 
color, 
form), 
or 
is 
the 
starting-
point 
of 
a 
complicated 
action; 
nor 
whether 
the 
activity 
in 
question 
(chemical, 
anatomical, 
and 
mathematical 
operations) 
is 
muscular 
or 
technical, 
or 
performed 
wholly 
in 
the 
imagination, 
or 
only 
intimated. 
The 
concept 
is 
to 
the 
physicist 
what 
a 
musical 
note 
is 
to 
a 
piano-player. 
A 
trained 
physicist 
or 
mathematician 
reads 
a 
memoir 
like 
a 
musician 
reads 
a 
score. 
But 
just 
as 
the 
piano-player 
must 
first 
learn 
to 
move 
his 
fingers 
singly 
and 
collectively, 
before 
he 
can 
follow 
his 
notes 
without 
effort, 
so 
the 
physicist 
or 
mathematician 
must 
go 
through 
a 
long 
apprenticeship 
before 
he 
gains 
control, 
so 
to 
speak, 
of 
the 
manifold 
delicate 
innervations 
of 
his 
muscles 
and 
imagination. 
Think 
of 
how 
frequently 
the 
beginner 
in 
physics 
or 
mathematics 
performs 
more, 
or 
less, 
than 
is 
required, 
or 
of 
how 
frequently 
he 
conceives 
things 
differently 
from 
what 
they 
are! 
But 
if, 
after 
having 
had 
sufficient 
discipline, 
he 
lights 
upon 
the 
phrase 
"coefficient 
of 
self-induction," 
he 
knows 
immediately 
what 
that 
term 
requires 
of 
him. 
Long 
and 
thoroughly 
practised 
actions, 
which 
have 
their 
origin 
in 
the 
necessity 
of 
comparing 
and 
representing 
facts 
by 
other 
facts, 
are 
thus 
the 
very 
kernel 
of 
concepts. 
In 
fact, 
positive 
and 
philosophical 
philology 
both 
claim 
to 
have 
established 
that 
all 
roots 
represent 
concepts 
and 
stood 
originally 
for 
muscular 
activities 
alone. 
The 
slow 
assent 
of 
physicists 
to 
Kirchhoff's 
dictum 
now 
becomes 
intelligible. 
They 
best 
could 
feel 
the 
vast 
amount 
of 
individual 
labor, 
theory, 
and 
skill 
required 
before 
the 
ideal 
of 
direct 
description 
could 
be 
realised. 


Suppose, 
now, 
the 
ideal 
of 
a 
given 
province 
of 
facts 
is 
reached. 
Does 
description 
accomplish 
all 
that 
the 
inquirer 
can 
ask? 
In 
my 
opinion, 
it 
does. 



Description 
is 
a 
building 
up 
of 
facts 
in 
thought, 
and 
this 
building 
up 
is, 
in 
the 
experimental 
sciences, 
often 
the 
condition 
of 
actual 
execution. 
For 
the 
physicist, 
to 
take 
a 
special 
case, 
the 
metrical 
units 
are 
the 
building-stones, 
the 
concepts 
the 
directions 
for 
building, 
and 
the 
facts 
the 
result 
of 
the 
building. 
Our 
mental 
imagery 
is 
almost 
a 
complete 
substitute 
for 
the 
fact, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
it 
we 
can 
ascertain 
all 
the 
fact's 
properties. 
We 
do 
not 
know 
that 
worst 
which 
we 
ourselves 
have 
made. 


People 
require 
of 
science 
that 
it 
should 
prophesy, 
and 
Hertz 
uses 
that 
expression 
in 
his 
posthumous 
Mechanics. 
But, 
natural 
as 
it 
is, 
the 
expression 
is 
too 
narrow. 
The 
geologist 
and 
the 
palæontologist, 
at 
times 
the 
astronomer, 
and 
always 
the 
historian 
and 
the 
philologist, 
prophesy, 
so 
to 
speak, 
backwards. 
The 
descriptive 
sciences, 
like 
geometry 
and 
mathematics, 
prophesy 
neither 
forward 
or 
backwards, 
but 
seek 
from 
given 
conditions 
the 
conditioned. 
Let 
us 
say 
rather: 
Science 
completes 
in 
thought 
facts 
that 
are 
only 
partly 
given. 
This 
is 
rendered 
possible 
by 
description, 
for 
description 
presupposes 
the 
interdependence 
of 
the 
descriptive 
elements: 
otherwise 
nothing 
would 
be 
described. 


It 
is 
said, 
description 
leaves 
the 
sense 
of 
causality 
unsatisfied. 
In 
fact, 
many 
imagine 
they 
understand 
motions 
better 
when 
they 
picture 
to 
themselves 
the 
pulling 
forces; 
and 
yet 
the 
accelerations, 
the 
facts, 
accomplish 
more, 
without 
superfluous 
additions. 
I 
hope 
that 
the 
science 
of 
the 
future 
will 
discard 
the 
idea 
of 
cause 
and 
effect, 
as 
being 
formally 
obscure; 
and 
in 
my 
feeling 
that 
these 
ideas 
contain 
a 
strong 
tincture 
of 
fetishism, 
I 
am 
certainly 
not 
alone. 
The 
more 
proper 
course 
is, 
to 
regard 
the 
abstract 
determinative 
elements 
of 
a 
fact 
as 
interdependent, 
in 
a 
purely 
logical 
way, 
as 
the 
mathematician 
or 
geometer 
does. 
True, 
by 
comparison 
with 
the 
will, 
forces 
are 
brought 
nearer 
to 
our 
feeling; 
but 
it 
may 
be 
that 
ultimately 
the 
will 
itself 
will 
be 
made 
clearer 
by 
comparison 
with 
the 
accelerations 
of 
masses. 


If 
we 
are 
asked, 
candidly, 
when 
is 
a 
fact 
clear 
to 
us, 
we 
must 
say 
"when 
we 
can 
reproduce 
it 
by 
very 
simple 
and 
very 
familiar 
intellectual 
operations, 
such 
as 
the 
construction 
of 
accelerations, 
or 
the 
geometrical 
summation 
of 
accelerations, 
and 
so 
forth." 
The 
requirement 
of 
simplicity 
is 
of 
course 
to 
the 
expert 
a 
different 
matter 
from 
what 
it 
is 
to 
the 
novice. 
For 
the 
first, 
description 
by 
a 
system 
of 
differential 
equations 
is 
sufficient; 
for 
the 
second, 



a 
gradual 
construction 
out 
of 
elementary 
laws 
is 
required. 
The 
first 
discerns 
at 
once 
the 
connexion 
of 
the 
two 
expositions. 
Of 
course, 
it 
is 
not 
disputed 
that 
the 
artistic 
value 
of 
materially 
equivalent 
descriptions 
may 
not 
be 
different. 


Most 
difficult 
is 
it 
to 
persuade 
strangers 
that 
the 
grand 
universal 
laws 
of 
physics, 
such 
as 
apply 
indiscriminately 
to 
material, 
electrical, 
magnetic, 
and 
other 
systems, 
are 
not 
essentially 
different 
from 
descriptions. 
As 
compared 
with 
many 
sciences, 
physics 
occupies 
in 
this 
respect 
a 
position 
of 
vantage 
that 
is 
easily 
explained. 
Take, 
for 
example, 
anatomy. 
As 
the 
anatomist 
in 
his 
quest 
for 
agreements 
and 
differences 
in 
animals 
ascends 
to 
ever 
higher 
and 
higher 
classifications, 
the 
individual 
facts 
that 
represent 
the 
ultimate 
terms 
of 
the 
system, 
are 
still 
so 
different 
that 
they 
must 
be 
singly 
noted. 
Think, 
for 
example, 
of 
the 
common 
marks 
of 
the 
Vertebrates, 
of 
the 
class-characters 
of 
Mammals 
and 
Birds 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
of 
Fishes 
on 
the 
other, 
of 
the 
double 
circulation 
of 
the 
blood 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
of 
the 
single 
on 
the 
other. 
In 
the 
end, 
always 
isolated 
facts 
remain, 
which 
show 
only 
a 
slight 
likeness 
to 
one 
another. 


A 
science 
still 
more 
closely 
allied 
to 
physics, 
chemistry, 
is 
often 
in 
the 
same 
strait. 
The 
abrupt 
change 
of 
the 
qualitative 
properties, 
in 
all 
likelihood 
conditioned 
by 
the 
slight 
stability 
of 
the 
intermediate 
states, 
the 
remote 
resemblance 
of 
the 
co-ordinated 
facts 
of 
chemistry 
render 
the 
treatment 
of 
its 
data 
difficult. 
Pairs 
of 
bodies 
of 
different 
qualitative 
properties 
unite 
in 
different 
mass-ratios; 
but 
no 
connexion 
between 
the 
first 
and 
the 
last 
is 
to 
be 
noted, 
at 
first. 


Physics, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
reveals 
to 
us 
wide 
domains 
of 
qualitatively 
homogeneous 
facts, 
differing 
from 
one 
another 
only 
in 
the 
number 
of 
equal 
parts 
into 
which 
their 
characteristic 
marks 
are 
divisible, 
that 
is, 
differing 
only 
quantitatively. 
Even 
where 
we 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
qualities 
(colors 
and 
sounds), 
quantitative 
characters 
of 
those 
qualities 
are 
at 
our 
disposal. 
Here 
the 
classification 
is 
so 
simple 
a 
task 
that 
it 
rarely 
impresses 
us 
as 
such, 
whilst 
in 
infinitely 
fine 
gradations, 
in 
a 
continuum 
of 
facts, 
our 
number-system 
is 
ready 
beforehand 
to 
follow 
as 
far 
as 
we 
wish. 
The 
co-ordinated 
facts 
are 
here 
extremely 
similar 
and 
very 
closely 
affined, 
as 
are 
also 
their 
descriptions 
which 
consist 
in 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
numerical 
measures 
of 
one 
given 
set 
of 
characters 
from 
those 
of 
a 
different 
set 
by 
means 
of 
familiar 
mathematical 



operations—methods 
of 
derivation. 
Thus, 
the 
common 
characteristics 
of 
all 
descriptions 
can 
be 
found 
here; 
and 
with 
them 
a 
succinct, 
comprehensive 
description, 
or 
a 
rule 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
all 
single 
descriptions, 
is 
assigned,—and 
this 
we 
call 
law. 
Well-known 
examples 
are 
the 
formulæ 
for 
freely 
falling 
bodies, 
for 
projectiles, 
for 
central 
motion, 
and 
so 
forth. 
If 
physics 
apparently 
accomplishes 
more 
by 
its 
methods 
than 
other 
sciences, 
we 
must 
remember 
that 
in 
a 
sense 
it 
has 
presented 
to 
it 
much 
simpler 
problems. 


The 
remaining 
sciences, 
whose 
facts 
also 
present 
a 
physical 
side, 
need 
not 
be 
envious 
of 
physics 
for 
this 
superiority; 
for 
all 
its 
acquisitions 
ultimately 
redound 
to 
their 
benefit 
as 
well. 
But 
also 
in 
other 
ways 
this 
mutual 
help 
shall 
and 
must 
change. 
Chemistry 
has 
advanced 
very 
far 
in 
making 
the 
methods 
of 
physics 
her 
own. 
Apart 
from 
older 
attempts, 
the 
periodical 
series 
of 
Lothar 
Meyer 
and 
Mendelejeff 
are 
a 
brilliant 
and 
adequate 
means 
of 
producing 
an 
easily 
surveyed 
system 
of 
facts, 
which 
by 
gradually 
becoming 
complete, 
will 
take 
the 
place 
almost 
of 
a 
continuum 
of 
facts. 
Further, 
by 
the 
study 
of 
solutions, 
of 
dissociation, 
in 
fact 
generally 
of 
phenomena 
which 
present 
a 
continuum 
of 
cases, 
the 
methods 
of 
thermodynamics 
have 
found 
entrance 
into 
chemistry. 
Similarly 
we 
may 
hope 
that, 
at 
some 
future 
day, 
a 
mathematician, 
letting 
the 
fact-continuum 
of 
embryology 
play 
before 
his 
mind, 
which 
the 
palæontologists 
of 
the 
future 
will 
supposedly 
have 
enriched 
with 
more 
intermediate 
and 
derivative 
forms 
between 
Saurian 
and 
Bird 
than 
the 
isolated 
Pterodactyl, 
Archæopteryx, 
Ichthyornis, 
and 
so 
forth, 
which 
we 
now 
have—that 
such 
a 
mathematician 
shall 
transform, 
by 
the 
variation 
of 
a 
few 
parameters, 
as 
in 
a 
dissolving 
view, 
one 
form 
into 
another, 
just 
as 
we 
transform 
one 
conic 
section 
into 
another. 


Reverting 
now 
to 
Kirchhoff's 
words, 
we 
can 
come 
to 
some 
agreement 
regarding 
their 
import. 
Nothing 
can 
be 
built 
without 
building-stones, 
mortar, 
scaffolding, 
and 
a 
builder's 
skill. 
Yet 
assuredly 
the 
wish 
is 
well 
founded, 
that 
will 
show 
to 
posterity 
the 
complete 
structure 
in 
its 
finished 
form, 
bereft 
of 
unsightly 
scaffolding. 
It 
is 
the 
pure 
logical 
and 
æsthetic 
sense 
of 
the 
mathematician 
that 
speaks 
out 
of 
Kirchhoff's 
words. 
Modern 
expositions 
of 
physics 
aspire 
after 
his 
ideal; 
that, 
too, 
is 
intelligible. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
a 
poor 
didactic 
shift, 
for 
one 
whose 
business 
it 
was 
to 
train 
architects, 
to 
say: 
"Here 
is 
a 
splendid 
edifice; 
if 
thou 
wouldst 
really 
build, 
go 
thou 
and 
do 
likewise". 



The 
barriers 
between 
the 
special 
sciences, 
which 
make 
division 
of 
work 
and 
concentration 
possible, 
but 
which 
appear 
to 
us 
after 
all 
as 
cold 
and 
conventional 
restrictions, 
will 
gradually 
disappear. 
Bridge 
upon 
bridge 
is 
thrown 
over 
the 
gaps. 
Contents 
and 
methods, 
even 
of 
the 
remotest 
branches, 
are 
compared. 
When 
the 
Congress 
of 
Natural 
Scientists 
shall 
meet 
a 
hundred 
years 
hence, 
we 
may 
expect 
that 
they 
will 
represent 
a 
unity 
in 
a 
higher 
sense 
than 
is 
possible 
to-day, 
not 
in 
sentiment 
and 
aim 
alone, 
but 
in 
method 
also. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
this 
great 
change 
will 
be 
helped 
by 
our 
keeping 
constantly 
before 
our 
minds 
the 
fact 
of 
the 
intrinsic 
relationship 
of 
all 
research, 
which 
Kirchhoff 
characterised 
with 
such 
classical 
simplicity. 



THE 
PART 
PLAYED 
BY 
ACCIDENT 
IN 
INVENTION 
AND 
DISCOVERY. 
[81] 


It 
is 
characteristic 
of 
the 
naïve 
and 
sanguine 
beginnings 
of 
thought 
in 
youthful 
men 
and 
nations, 
that 
all 
problems 
are 
held 
to 
be 
soluble 
and 
fundamentally 
intelligible 
on 
the 
first 
appearance 
of 
success. 
The 
sage 
of 
Miletus, 
on 
seeing 
plants 
take 
their 
rise 
from 
moisture, 
believed 
he 
had 
comprehended 
the 
whole 
of 
nature, 
and 
he 
of 
Samos, 
on 
discovering 
that 
definite 
numbers 
corresponded 
to 
the 
lengths 
of 
harmonic 
strings, 
imagined 
he 
could 
exhaust 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
world 
by 
means 
of 
numbers. 
Philosophy 
and 
science 
in 
such 
periods 
are 
blended. 
Wider 
experience, 
however, 
speedily 
discloses 
the 
error 
of 
such 
a 
course, 
gives 
rise 
to 
criticism, 
and 
leads 
to 
the 
division 
and 
ramification 
of 
the 
sciences. 


At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
necessity 
of 
a 
broad 
and 
general 
view 
of 
the 
world 
remains; 
and 
to 
meet 
this 
need 
philosophy 
parts 
company 
with 
special 
inquiry. 
It 
is 
true, 
the 
two 
are 
often 
found 
united 
in 
gigantic 
personalities. 
But 
as 
a 
rule 
their 
ways 
diverge 
more 
and 
more 
widely 
from 
each 
other. 
And 
if 
the 
estrangement 
of 
philosophy 
from 
science 
can 
reach 
a 
point 
where 
data 
unworthy 
of 
the 
nursery 
are 
not 
deemed 
too 
scanty 
as 
foundations 
of 
the 
world, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
the 
thorough-paced 
specialist 
may 
go 
to 
the 
extreme 
of 
rejecting 
point-blank 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
broader 
view, 
or 
at 
least 
of 
deeming 
it 
superfluous, 
forgetful 
of 
Voltaire's 
apophthegm, 
nowhere 
more 
applicable 
than 
here, 
Le 
superflu—chose 
très 
nécessaire. 


It 
is 
true, 
the 
history 
of 
philosophy, 
owing 
to 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
its 
constructive 
data, 
is 
and 
must 
be 
largely 
a 
history 
of 
error. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
the 
height 
of 
ingratitude 
on 
our 
part 
to 
forget 
that 
the 
seeds 
of 
thoughts 
which 
still 
fructify 
the 
soil 
of 
special 
research, 
such 
as 
the 
theory 
of 
irrationals, 
the 
conceptions 
of 
conservation, 
the 
doctrine 
of 
evolution, 
the 
idea 
of 
specific 
energies, 
and 
so 
forth, 
may 
be 
traced 
back 
in 
distant 
ages 
to 
philosophical 
sources. 
Furthermore, 
to 
have 
deferred 
or 
abandoned 
the 
attempt 
at 
a 
broad 
philosophical 
view 
of 
the 
world 
from 
a 
full 
knowledge 
of 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
our 
materials, 
is 
quite 
a 
different 
thing 
from 
never 
having 
undertaken 
it 
at 
all. 



The 
revenge 
of 
its 
neglect, 
moreover, 
is 
constantly 
visited 
upon 
the 
specialist 
by 
his 
committal 
of 
the 
very 
errors 
which 
philosophy 
long 
ago 
exposed. 
As 
a 
fact, 
in 
physics 
and 
physiology, 
particularly 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
this 
century, 
are 
to 
be 
met 
intellectual 
productions 
which 
for 
naïve 
simplicity 
are 
not 
a 
jot 
inferior 
to 
those 
of 
the 
Ionian 
school, 
or 
to 
the 
Platonic 
ideas, 
or 
to 
that 
much 
reviled 
ontological 
proof. 


Latterly, 
there 
has 
been 
evidence 
of 
a 
gradual 
change 
in 
the 
situation. 
Recent 
philosophy 
has 
set 
itself 
more 
modest 
and 
more 
attainable 
ends; 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
inimical 
to 
special 
inquiry; 
in 
fact, 
it 
is 
zealously 
taking 
part 
in 
that 
inquiry. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
special 
sciences, 
mathematics 
and 
physics, 
no 
less 
than 
philology, 
have 
become 
eminently 
philosophical. 
The 
material 
presented 
is 
no 
longer 
accepted 
uncritically. 
The 
glance 
of 
the 
inquirer 
is 
bent 
upon 
neighboring 
fields, 
whence 
that 
material 
has 
been 
derived. 
The 
different 
special 
departments 
are 
striving 
for 
closer 
union, 
and 
gradually 
the 
conviction 
is 
gaining 
ground 
that 
philosophy 
can 
consist 
only 
of 
mutual, 
complemental 
criticism, 
interpenetration, 
and 
union 
of 
the 
special 
sciences 
into 
a 
consolidated 
whole. 
As 
the 
blood 
in 
nourishing 
the 
body 
separates 
into 
countless 
capillaries, 
only 
to 
be 
collected 
again 
and 
to 
meet 
in 
the 
heart, 
so 
in 
the 
science 
of 
the 
future 
all 
the 
rills 
of 
knowledge 
will 
gather 
more 
and 
more 
into 
a 
common 
and 
undivided 
stream. 


It 
is 
this 
view—not 
an 
unfamiliar 
one 
to 
the 
present 
generation—that 
I 
purpose 
to 
advocate. 
Entertain 
no 
hope, 
or 
rather 
fear, 
that 
I 
shall 
construct 
systems 
for 
you. 
I 
shall 
remain 
a 
natural 
inquirer. 
Nor 
expect 
that 
it 
is 
my 
intention 
to 
skirt 
all 
the 
fields 
of 
natural 
inquiry. 
I 
can 
attempt 
to 
be 
your 
guide 
only 
in 
that 
branch 
which 
is 
familiar 
to 
me, 
and 
even 
there 
I 
can 
assist 
in 
the 
furtherment 
of 
only 
a 
small 
portion 
of 
the 
allotted 
task. 
If 
I 
shall 
succeed 
in 
rendering 
plain 
to 
you 
the 
relations 
of 
physics, 
psychology, 
and 
the 
theory 
of 
knowledge, 
so 
that 
you 
may 
draw 
from 
each 
profit 
and 
light, 
redounding 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
each, 
I 
shall 
regard 
my 
work 
as 
not 
having 
been 
in 
vain. 
Therefore, 
to 
illustrate 
by 
an 
example 
how, 
consonantly 
with 
my 
powers 
and 
views, 
I 
conceive 
such 
inquiries 
should 
be 
conducted, 
I 
shall 
treat 
to-day, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
brief 
sketch, 
of 
the 
following 
special 
and 
limited 
subject—of 
the 
part 
which 
accidental 
circumstances 
play 
in 
the 
development 
of 
inventions 
and 
discoveries. 



When 
we 
Germans 
say 
of 
a 
man 
that 
he 
was 
not 
the 
inventor 
of 
gunpowder, 


[82] 
we 
impliedly 
cast 
a 
grave 
suspicion 
on 
his 
abilities. 
But 
the 
expression 
is 
not 
a 
felicitous 
one, 
as 
there 
is 
probably 
no 
invention 
in 
which 
deliberate 
thought 
had 
a 
smaller, 
and 
pure 
luck 
a 
larger, 
share 
than 
in 
this. 
It 
is 
well 
to 
ask, 
Are 
we 
justified 
in 
placing 
a 
low 
estimate 
on 
the 
achievement 
of 
an 
inventor 
because 
accident 
has 
assisted 
him 
in 
his 
work? 
Huygens, 
whose 
discoveries 
and 
inventions 
are 
justly 
sufficient 
to 
entitle 
him 
to 
an 
opinion 
in 
such 
matters, 
lays 
great 
emphasis 
on 
this 
factor. 
He 
asserts 
that 
a 
man 
capable 
of 
inventing 
the 
telescope 
without 
the 
concurrence 
of 
accident 
must 
have 
been 
gifted 
with 
superhuman 
genius. 
[83] 
A 
man 
living 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
civilisation 
finds 
himself 
surrounded 
by 
a 
host 
of 
marvellous 
inventions, 
considering 
none 
other 
than 
the 
means 
of 
satisfying 
the 
needs 
of 
daily 
life. 
Picture 
such 
a 
man 
transported 
to 
the 
epoch 
preceding 
the 
invention 
of 
these 
ingenious 
appliances, 
and 
imagine 
him 
undertaking 
in 
a 
serious 
manner 
to 
comprehend 
their 
origin. 
At 
first 
the 
intellectual 
power 
of 
the 
men 
capable 
of 
producing 
such 
marvels 
will 
strike 
him 
as 
incredible, 
or, 
if 
we 
adopt 
the 
ancient 
view, 
as 
divine. 
But 
his 
astonishment 
is 
considerably 
allayed 
by 
the 
disenchanting 
yet 
elucidative 
revelations 
of 
the 
history 
of 
primitive 
culture, 
which 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
prove 
that 
these 
inventions 
took 
their 
rise 
very 
slowly 
and 
by 
imperceptible 
degrees. 


A 
small 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
with 
fire 
kindled 
in 
it 
constituted 
the 
primitive 
stove. 
The 
flesh 
of 
the 
quarry, 
wrapped 
with 
water 
in 
its 
skin, 
was 
boiled 
by 
contact 
with 
heated 
stones. 
Cooking 
by 
stones 
was 
also 
done 
in 
wooden 
vessels. 
Hollow 
gourds 
were 
protected 
from 
the 
fire 
by 
coats 
of 
clay. 
Thus, 
from 
the 
burned 
clay 
accidentally 
originated 
the 
enveloping 
pot, 
which 
rendered 
the 
gourd 
superfluous, 
although 
for 
a 
long 
time 
thereafter 
the 
clay 
was 
still 
spread 
over 
the 
gourd, 
or 
pressed 
into 
woven 
wicker-work 
before 
the 
potter's 
art 
assumed 
its 
final 
independence. 
Even 
then 
the 
wicker-work 
ornament 
was 
retained, 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
attest 
of 
its 
origin. 


We 
see, 
thus, 
it 
is 
by 
accidental 
circumstances, 
or 
by 
such 
as 
lie 
without 
our 
purpose, 
foresight, 
and 
power, 
that 
man 
is 
gradually 
led 
to 
the 
acquaintance 
of 
improved 
means 
of 
satisfying 
his 
wants. 
Let 
the 
reader 
picture 
to 
himself 
the 
genius 
of 
a 
man 
who 
could 
have 
foreseen 
without 
the 
help 
of 
accident 
that 
clay 
handled 
in 
the 
ordinary 
manner 
would 
produce 
a 
useful 
cooking 



utensil! 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
inventions 
made 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
civilisation, 
including 
language, 
writing, 
money, 
and 
the 
rest, 
could 
not 
have 
been 
the 
product 
of 
deliberate 
methodical 
reflexion 
for 
the 
simple 
reason 
that 
no 
idea 
of 
their 
value 
and 
significance 
could 
have 
been 
had 
except 
from 
practical 
use. 
The 
invention 
of 
the 
bridge 
may 
have 
been 
suggested 
by 
the 
trunk 
of 
a 
tree 
which 
had 
fallen 
athwart 
a 
mountain-torrent; 
that 
of 
the 
tool 
by 
the 
use 
of 
a 
stone 
accidentally 
taken 
into 
the 
hand 
to 
crack 
nuts. 
The 
use 
of 
fire 
probably 
started 
in 
and 
was 
disseminated 
from 
regions 
where 
volcanic 
eruptions, 
hot 
springs, 
and 
burning 
jets 
of 
natural 
gas 
afforded 
opportunity 
for 
quietly 
observing 
and 
turning 
to 
practical 
account 
the 
properties 
of 
fire. 
Only 
after 
that 
had 
been 
done 
could 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
fire-drill 
be 
appreciated, 
an 
instrument 
which 
was 
probably 
discovered 
from 
boring 
a 
hole 
through 
a 
piece 
of 
wood. 
The 
suggestion 
of 
a 
distinguished 
inquirer 
that 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
fire-drill 
originated 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
a 
religious 
ceremony 
is 
both 
fantastic 
and 
incredible. 
And 
as 
to 
the 
use 
of 
fire, 
we 
should 
no 
more 
attempt 
to 
derive 
that 
from 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
fire-drill 
than 
we 
should 
from 
the 
invention 
of 
sulphur 
matches. 
Unquestionably 
the 
opposite 
course 
was 
the 
real 
one. 
[84] 


Similar 
phenomena, 
though 
still 
largely 
veiled 
in 
obscurity, 
mark 
the 
initial 
transition 
of 
nations 
from 
a 
hunting 
to 
a 
nomadic 
life 
and 
to 
agriculture. 
[85] 
We 
shall 
not 
multiply 
examples, 
but 
content 
ourselves 
with 
the 
remark 
that 
the 
same 
phenomena 
recur 
in 
historical 
times, 
in 
the 
ages 
of 
great 
technical 
inventions, 
and, 
further, 
that 
regarding 
them 
the 
most 
whimsical 
notions 
have 
been 
circulated—notions 
which 
ascribe 
to 
accident 
an 
unduly 
exaggerated 
part, 
and 
one 
which 
in 
a 
psychological 
respect 
is 
absolutely 
impossible. 
The 
observation 
of 
steam 
escaping 
from 
a 
tea-kettle 
and 
of 
the 
clattering 
of 
the 
lid 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
led 
to 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
steam-engine. 
Just 
think 
of 
the 
gap 
between 
this 
spectacle 
and 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
performance 
of 
great 
mechanical 
work 
by 
steam, 
for 
a 
man 
totally 
ignorant 
of 
the 
steam-engine! 
Let 
us 
suppose, 
however, 
that 
an 
engineer, 
versed 
in 
the 
practical 
construction 
of 
pumps, 
should 
accidentally 
dip 
into 
water 
an 
inverted 
bottle 
that 
had 
been 
filled 
with 
steam 
for 
drying 
and 
still 
retained 
its 
steam. 
He 
would 
see 
the 
water 
rush 
violently 
into 
the 
bottle, 
and 
the 
idea 
would 
very 
naturally 
suggest 
itself 
of 
founding 
on 
this 
experience 
a 
convenient 
and 
useful 
atmospheric 
steam-pump, 
which 
by 
imperceptible 
degrees, 
both 
psychologically 
possible 
and 
immediate, 
would 
then 
undergo 
a 
natural 
and 



gradual 
transformation 
into 
Watt's 
steam-engine. 


But 
granting 
that 
the 
most 
important 
inventions 
are 
brought 
to 
man's 
notice 
accidentally 
and 
in 
ways 
that 
are 
beyond 
his 
foresight, 
yet 
it 
does 
not 
follow 
that 
accident 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
to 
produce 
an 
invention. 
The 
part 
which 
man 
plays 
is 
by 
no 
means 
a 
passive 
one. 
Even 
the 
first 
potter 
in 
the 
primeval 
forest 
must 
have 
felt 
some 
stirrings 
of 
genius 
within 
him. 
In 
all 
such 
cases, 
the 
inventor 
is 
obliged 
to 
take 
note 
of 
the 
new 
fact, 
he 
must 
discover 
and 
grasp 
its 
advantageous 
feature, 
and 
must 
have 
the 
power 
to 
turn 
that 
feature 
to 
account 
in 
the 
realisation 
of 
his 
purpose. 
He 
must 
isolate 
the 
new 
feature, 
impress 
it 
upon 
his 
memory, 
unite 
and 
interweave 
it 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
his 
thought; 
in 
short, 
he 
must 
possess 
the 
capacity 
to 
profit 
by 
experience. 


The 
capacity 
to 
profit 
by 
experience 
might 
well 
be 
set 
up 
as 
a 
test 
of 
intelligence. 
This 
power 
varies 
considerably 
in 
men 
of 
the 
same 
race, 
and 
increases 
enormously 
as 
we 
advance 
from 
the 
lower 
animals 
to 
man. 
The 
former 
are 
limited 
in 
this 
regard 
almost 
entirely 
to 
the 
reflex 
actions 
which 
they 
have 
inherited 
with 
their 
organism, 
they 
are 
almost 
totally 
incapable 
of 
individual 
experience, 
and 
considering 
their 
simple 
wants 
are 
scarcely 
in 
need 
of 
it. 
The 
ivory-snail 
(Eburna 
spirata) 
never 
learns 
to 
avoid 
the 
carnivorous 
Actinia, 
no 
matter 
how 
often 
it 
may 
wince 
under 
the 
latter's 
shower 
of 
needles, 
apparently 
having 
no 
memory 
for 
pain 
whatever. 
[86] 
A 
spider 
can 
be 
lured 
forth 
repeatedly 
from 
its 
hole 
by 
touching 
its 
web 
with 
a 
tuning-fork. 
The 
moth 
plunges 
again 
and 
again 
into 
the 
flame 
which 
has 
burnt 
it. 
The 
humming-bird 
hawk-moth 
[87] 
dashes 
repeatedly 
against 
the 
painted 
roses 
of 
the 
wall-paper, 
like 
the 
unhappy 
and 
desperate 
thinker 
who 
never 
wearies 
of 
attacking 
the 
same 
insoluble 
chimerical 
problem. 
As 
aimlessly 
almost 
as 
Maxwell's 
gaseous 
molecules 
and 
in 
the 
same 
unreasoning 
manner 
common 
flies 
in 
their 
search 
for 
light 
and 
air 
stream 
against 
the 
glass 
pane 
of 
a 
half-opened 
window 
and 
remain 
there 
from 
sheer 
inability 
to 
find 
their 
way 
around 
the 
narrow 
frame. 
But 
a 
pike 
separated 
from 
the 
minnows 
of 
his 
aquarium 
by 
a 
glass 
partition, 
learns 
after 
the 
lapse 
of 
a 
few 
months, 
though 
only 
after 
having 
butted 
himself 
half 
to 
death, 
that 
he 
cannot 
attack 
these 
fishes 
with 
impunity. 
What 
is 
more, 
he 
leaves 
them 
in 
peace 
even 
after 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
partition, 
though 
he 
will 
bolt 
a 
strange 
fish 
at 
once. 
Considerable 
memory 
must 
be 
attributed 
to 
birds 
of 
passage, 
a 
memory 
which, 
probably 
owing 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
disturbing 
thoughts, 
acts 



with 
the 
precision 
of 
that 
of 
some 
idiots. 
Finally, 
the 
susceptibility 
to 
training 
evinced 
by 
the 
higher 
vertebrates 
is 
indisputable 
proof 
of 
the 
ability 
of 
these 
animals 
to 
profit 
by 
experience. 


A 
powerfully 
developed 
mechanical 
memory, 
which 
recalls 
vividly 
and 
faithfully 
old 
situations, 
is 
sufficient 
for 
avoiding 
definite 
particular 
dangers, 
or 
for 
taking 
advantage 
of 
definite 
particular 
opportunities. 
But 
more 
is 
required 
for 
the 
development 
of 
inventions. 
More 
extensive 
chains 
of 
images 
are 
necessary 
here, 
the 
excitation 
by 
mutual 
contact 
of 
widely 
different 
trains 
of 
ideas, 
a 
more 
powerful, 
more 
manifold, 
and 
richer 
connexion 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
memory, 
a 
more 
powerful 
and 
impressionable 
psychical 
life, 
heightened 
by 
use. 
A 
man 
stands 
on 
the 
bank 
of 
a 
mountain-torrent, 
which 
is 
a 
serious 
obstacle 
to 
him. 
He 
remembers 
that 
he 
has 
crossed 
just 
such 
a 
torrent 
before 
on 
the 
trunk 
of 
a 
fallen 
tree. 
Hard 
by 
trees 
are 
growing. 
He 
has 
often 
moved 
the 
trunks 
of 
fallen 
trees. 
He 
has 
also 
felled 
trees 
before, 
and 
then 
moved 
them. 
To 
fell 
trees 
he 
has 
used 
sharp 
stones. 
He 
goes 
in 
search 
of 
such 
a 
stone, 
and 
as 
the 
old 
situations 
that 
crowd 
into 
his 
memory 
and 
are 
held 
there 
in 
living 
reality 
by 
the 
definite 
powerful 
interest 
which 
he 
has 
in 
crossing 
just 
this 
torrent,—as 
these 
impressions 
are 
made 
to 
pass 
before 
his 
mind 
in 
the 
inverse 
order 
in 
which 
they 
were 
here 
evoked, 
he 
invents 
the 
bridge. 


There 
can 
be 
no 
doubt 
but 
the 
higher 
vertebrates 
adapt 
their 
actions 
in 
some 
moderate 
degree 
to 
circumstances. 
The 
fact 
that 
they 
give 
no 
appreciable 
evidence 
of 
advance 
by 
the 
accumulation 
of 
inventions, 
is 
satisfactorily 
explained 
by 
a 
difference 
of 
degree 
or 
intensity 
of 
intelligence 
as 
compared 
with 
man; 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
difference 
of 
kind 
is 
not 
necessary. 
A 
person 
who 
saves 
a 
little 
every 
day, 
be 
it 
ever 
so 
little, 
has 
an 
incalculable 
advantage 
over 
him 
who 
daily 
squanders 
that 
amount, 
or 
is 
unable 
to 
keep 
what 
he 
has 
accumulated. 
A 
slight 
quantitative 
difference 
in 
such 
things 
explains 
enormous 
differences 
of 
advancement. 


The 
rules 
which 
hold 
good 
in 
prehistoric 
times 
also 
hold 
good 
in 
historical 
times, 
and 
the 
remarks 
made 
on 
invention 
may 
be 
applied 
almost 
without 
modification 
to 
discovery; 
for 
the 
two 
are 
distinguished 
solely 
by 
the 
use 
to 
which 
the 
new 
knowledge 
is 
put. 
In 
both 
cases 
the 
investigator 
is 
concerned 
with 
some 
newly 
observed 
relation 
of 
new 
or 
old 
properties, 
abstract 
or 



concrete. 
It 
is 
observed, 
for 
example, 
that 
a 
substance 
which 
gives 
a 
chemical 
reaction 
A 
is 
also 
the 
cause 
of 
a 
chemical 
reaction 
B. 
If 
this 
observation 
fulfils 
no 
purpose 
but 
that 
of 
furthering 
the 
scientist's 
insight, 
or 
of 
removing 
a 
source 
of 
intellectual 
discomfort, 
we 
have 
a 
discovery; 
but 
an 
invention, 
if 
in 
using 
the 
substance 
giving 
the 
reaction 
A 
to 
produce 
the 
desired 
reaction 
B, 
we 
have 
a 
practical 
end 
in 
view, 
and 
seek 
to 
remove 
a 
source 
of 
material 
discomfort. 
The 
phrase, 
disclosure 
of 
the 
connexion 
of 
reactions, 
is 
broad 
enough 
to 
cover 
discoveries 
and 
inventions 
in 
all 
departments. 
It 
embraces 
the 
Pythagorean 
proposition, 
which 
is 
a 
combination 
of 
a 
geometrical 
and 
an 
arithmetical 
reaction, 
Newton's 
discovery 
of 
the 
connexion 
of 
Kepler's 
motions 
with 
the 
law 
of 
the 
inverse 
squares, 
as 
perfectly 
as 
it 
does 
the 
detection 
of 
some 
minute 
but 
appropriate 
alteration 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
tool, 
or 
of 
some 
appropriate 
change 
in 
the 
methods 
of 
a 
dyeing 
establishment. 


The 
disclosure 
of 
new 
provinces 
of 
facts 
before 
unknown 
can 
only 
be 
brought 
about 
by 
accidental 
circumstances, 
under 
which 
are 
remarked 
facts 
that 
commonly 
go 
unnoticed. 
The 
achievement 
of 
the 
discoverer 
here 
consists 
in 
his 
sharpened 
attention, 
which 
detects 
the 
uncommon 
features 
of 
an 
occurrence 
and 
their 
determining 
conditions 
from 
their 
most 
evanescent 
marks, 
[88] 
and 
discovers 
means 
of 
submitting 
them 
to 
exact 
and 
full 
observation. 
Under 
this 
head 
belong 
the 
first 
disclosures 
of 
electrical 
and 
magnetic 
phenomena, 
Grimaldi's 
observation 
of 
interference, 
Arago's 
discovery 
of 
the 
increased 
check 
suffered 
by 
a 
magnetic 
needle 
vibrating 
in 
a 
copper 
envelope 
as 
compared 
with 
that 
observed 
in 
a 
bandbox, 
Foucault's 
observation 
of 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
plane 
of 
vibration 
of 
a 
rod 
accidentally 
struck 
while 
rotating 
in 
a 
turning-lathe, 
Mayer's 
observation 
of 
the 
increased 
redness 
of 
venous 
blood 
in 
the 
tropics, 
Kirchhoff's 
observation 
of 
the 
augmentation 
of 
the 
D-line 
in 
the 
solar 
spectrum 
by 
the 
interposition 
of 
a 
sodium 
lamp, 
Schönbein's 
discovery 
of 
ozone 
from 
the 
phosphoric 
smell 
emitted 
on 
the 
disruption 
of 
air 
by 
electric 
sparks, 
and 
a 
host 
of 
others. 
All 
these 
facts, 
of 
which 
unquestionably 
many 
were 
seen 
numbers 
of 
times 
before 
they 
were 
noticed, 
are 
examples 
of 
the 
inauguration 
of 
momentous 
discoveries 
by 
accidental 
circumstances, 
and 
place 
the 
importance 
of 
strained 
attention 
in 
a 
brilliant 
light. 


But 
not 
only 
is 
a 
significant 
part 
played 
in 
the 
beginning 
of 
an 
inquiry 
by 
cooperative 
circumstances 
beyond 
the 
foresight 
of 
the 
investigator; 
their 



influence 
is 
also 
active 
in 
its 
prosecution. 
Dufay, 
thus, 
whilst 
following 
up 
the 
behavior 
of 
one 
electrical 
state 
which 
he 
had 
assumed, 
discovers 
the 
existence 
of 
two. 
Fresnel 
learns 
by 
accident 
that 
the 
interference-bands 
received 
on 
ground 
glass 
are 
seen 
to 
better 
advantage 
in 
the 
open 
air. 
The 
diffraction-phenomenon 
of 
two 
slits 
proved 
to 
be 
considerably 
different 
from 
what 
Fraunhofer 
had 
anticipated, 
and 
in 
following 
up 
this 
circumstance 
he 
was 
led 
to 
the 
important 
discovery 
of 
grating-spectra. 
Faraday's 
induction-
phenomenon 
departed 
widely 
from 
the 
initial 
conception 
which 
occasioned 
his 
experiments, 
and 
it 
is 
precisely 
this 
deviation 
that 
constitutes 
his 
real 
discovery. 


Every 
man 
has 
pondered 
on 
some 
subject. 
Every 
one 
of 
us 
can 
multiply 
the 
examples 
cited, 
by 
less 
illustrious 
ones 
from 
his 
own 
experience. 
I 
shall 
cite 
but 
one. 
On 
rounding 
a 
railway 
curve 
once, 
I 
accidentally 
remarked 
a 
striking 
apparent 
inclination 
of 
the 
houses 
and 
trees. 
I 
inferred 
that 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
total 
resultant 
physical 
acceleration 
of 
the 
body 
reacts 
physiologically 
as 
the 
vertical. 
Afterwards, 
in 
attempting 
to 
inquire 
more 
carefully 
into 
this 
phenomenon, 
and 
this 
only, 
in 
a 
large 
whirling 
machine, 
the 
collateral 
phenomena 
conducted 
me 
to 
the 
sensation 
of 
angular 
acceleration, 
vertigo, 
Flouren's 
experiments 
on 
the 
section 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals 
etc., 
from 
which 
gradually 
resulted 
views 
relating 
to 
sensations 
of 
direction 
which 
are 
also 
held 
by 
Breuer 
and 
Brown, 
which 
were 
at 
first 
contested 
on 
all 
hands, 
but 
are 
now 
regarded 
on 
many 
sides 
as 
correct, 
and 
which 
have 
been 
recently 
enriched 
by 
the 
interesting 
inquiries 
of 
Breuer 
concerning 
the 
macula 
acustica, 
and 
Kreidel's 
experiments 
with 
magnetically 
orientable 
crustacea. 


[89] 
Not 
disregard 
of 
accident 
but 
a 
direct 
and 
purposeful 
employment 
of 
it 
advances 
research. 
The 
more 
powerful 
the 
psychical 
connexion 
of 
the 
memory 
pictures 
is,—and 
it 
varies 
with 
the 
individual 
and 
the 
mood,—the 
more 
apt 
is 
the 
same 
accidental 
observation 
to 
be 
productive 
of 
results. 
Galileo 
knows 
that 
the 
air 
has 
weight; 
he 
also 
knows 
of 
the 
"resistance 
to 
a 
vacuum," 
expressed 
both 
in 
weight 
and 
in 
the 
height 
of 
a 
column 
of 
water. 
But 
the 
two 
ideas 
dwelt 
asunder 
in 
his 
mind. 
It 
remained 
for 
Torricelli 
to 
vary 
the 
specific 
gravity 
of 
the 
liquid 
measuring 
the 
pressure, 
and 
not 
till 
then 
was 
the 
air 
included 
in 
the 
list 
of 
pressure-exerting 
fluids. 
The 
reversal 
of 
the 
lines 
of 
the 
spectrum 
was 
seen 
repeatedly 
before 
Kirchhoff, 
and 
had 
been 
mechanically 
explained. 
But 



it 
was 
left 
for 
his 
penetrating 
vision 
to 
discern 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
connexion 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
with 
questions 
of 
heat, 
and 
to 
him 
alone 
through 
persistent 
labor 
was 
revealed 
the 
sweeping 
significance 
of 
the 
fact 
for 
the 
mobile 
equilibrium 
of 
heat. 
Supposing, 
then, 
that 
such 
a 
rich 
organic 
connexion 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
memory 
exists, 
and 
is 
the 
prime 
distinguishing 
mark 
of 
the 
inquirer, 
next 
in 
importance 
certainly 
is 
that 
intense 
interest 
in 
a 
definite 
object, 
in 
a 
definite 
idea, 
which 
fashions 
advantageous 
combinations 
of 
thought 
from 
elements 
before 
disconnected, 
and 
obtrudes 
that 
idea 
into 
every 
observation 
made, 
and 
into 
every 
thought 
formed, 
making 
it 
enter 
into 
relationship 
with 
all 
things. 
Thus 
Bradley, 
deeply 
engrossed 
with 
the 
subject 
of 
aberration, 
is 
led 
to 
its 
solution 
by 
an 
exceedingly 
unobtrusive 
experience 
in 
crossing 
the 
Thames. 
It 
is 
permissible, 
therefore, 
to 
ask 
whether 
accident 
leads 
the 
discoverer, 
or 
the 
discoverer 
accident, 
to 
a 
successful 
outcome 
in 
scientific 
quests. 


No 
man 
should 
dream 
of 
solving 
a 
great 
problem 
unless 
he 
is 
so 
thoroughly 
saturated 
with 
his 
subject 
that 
everything 
else 
sinks 
into 
comparative 
insignificance. 
During 
a 
hurried 
meeting 
with 
Mayer 
in 
Heidelberg 
once, 
Jolly 
remarked, 
with 
a 
rather 
dubious 
implication, 
that 
if 
Mayer's 
theory 
were 
correct 
water 
could 
be 
warmed 
by 
shaking. 
Mayer 
went 
away 
without 
a 
word 
of 
reply. 
Several 
weeks 
later, 
and 
now 
unrecognised 
by 
Jolly, 
he 
rushed 
into 
the 
latter's 
presence 
exclaiming: 
"Es 
ischt 
aso!" 
(It 
is 
so, 
it 
is 
so!) 
It 
was 
only 
after 
considerable 
explanation 
that 
Jolly 
found 
out 
what 
Mayer 
wanted 
to 
say. 
The 
incident 
needs 
no 
comment. 
[90] 


A 
person 
deadened 
to 
sensory 
impressions 
and 
given 
up 
solely 
to 
the 
pursuit 
of 
his 
own 
thoughts, 
may 
also 
light 
on 
an 
idea 
that 
will 
divert 
his 
mental 
activity 
into 
totally 
new 
channels. 
In 
such 
cases 
it 
is 
a 
psychical 
accident, 
an 
intellectual 
experience, 
as 
distinguished 
from 
a 
physical 
accident, 
to 
which 
the 
person 
owes 
his 
discovery—a 
discovery 
which 
is 
here 
made 
"deductively" 
by 
means 
of 
mental 
copies 
of 
the 
world, 
instead 
of 
experimentally. 
Purely 
experimental 
inquiry, 
moreover, 
does 
not 
exist, 
for, 
as 
Gauss 
says, 
virtually 
we 
always 
experiment 
with 
our 
thoughts. 
And 
it 
is 
precisely 
that 
constant, 
corrective 
interchange 
or 
intimate 
union 
of 
experiment 
and 
deduction, 
as 
it 
was 
cultivated 
by 
Galileo 
in 
his 
Dialogues 
and 
by 
Newton 
in 
his 
Optics, 
that 
is 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
benign 
fruitfulness 
of 
modern 
scientific 
inquiry 
as 
contrasted 
with 
that 
of 
antiquity, 
where 



observation 
and 
reflexion 
ofttimes 
pursued 
their 
respective 
courses 
like 
two 
strangers. 


We 
have 
to 
wait 
for 
the 
appearance 
of 
a 
favorable 
physical 
accident. 
The 
movement 
of 
our 
thoughts 
obeys 
the 
law 
of 
association. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
meagre 
experience 
the 
result 
of 
this 
law 
is 
simply 
the 
mechanical 
reproduction 
of 
definite 
sensory 
experiences. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
the 
psychical 
life 
is 
subjected 
to 
the 
incessant 
influences 
of 
a 
powerful 
and 
rich 
experience, 
then 
every 
representative 
element 
in 
the 
mind 
is 
connected 
with 
so 
many 
others 
that 
the 
actual 
and 
natural 
course 
of 
the 
thoughts 
is 
easily 
influenced 
and 
determined 
by 
insignificant 
circumstances, 
which 
accidentally 
are 
decisive. 
Hereupon, 
the 
process 
termed 
imagination 
produces 
its 
protean 
and 
infinitely 
diversified 
forms. 
Now 
what 
can 
we 
do 
to 
guide 
this 
process, 
seeing 
that 
the 
combinatory 
law 
of 
the 
images 
is 
without 
our 
reach? 
Rather 
let 
us 
ask, 
what 
influence 
can 
a 
powerful 
and 
constantly 
recurring 
idea 
exert 
on 
the 
movement 
of 
our 
thoughts? 
According 
to 
what 
has 
preceded, 
the 
answer 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
question 
itself. 
The 
idea 
dominates 
the 
thought 
of 
the 
inquirer, 
not 
the 
latter 
the 
former. 


Let 
us 
see, 
now, 
if 
we 
can 
acquire 
a 
profounder 
insight 
into 
the 
process 
of 
discovery. 
The 
condition 
of 
the 
discoverer 
is, 
as 
James 
has 
aptly 
remarked, 
not 
unlike 
the 
situation 
of 
a 
person 
who 
is 
trying 
to 
remember 
something 
that 
he 
has 
forgotten. 
Both 
are 
sensible 
of 
a 
gap, 
and 
have 
only 
a 
remote 
presentiment 
of 
what 
is 
missing. 
Suppose 
I 
meet 
in 
a 
company 
a 
well-known 
and 
affable 
gentleman 
whose 
name 
I 
have 
forgotten, 
and 
who 
to 
my 
horror 
asks 
to 
be 
introduced 
to 
some 
one. 
I 
set 
to 
work 
according 
to 
Lichtenberg's 
rule, 
and 
run 
down 
the 
alphabet 
in 
search 
of 
the 
initial 
letter 
of 
his 
name. 
A 
vague 
sympathy 
holds 
me 
at 
the 
letter 
G. 
Tentatively 
I 
add 
the 
second 
letter 
and 
am 
arrested 
at 
e, 
and 
long 
before 
I 
have 
tried 
the 
third 
letter 
r, 
the 
name 
"Gerson" 
sounds 
sonorously 
upon 
my 
ear, 
and 
my 
anguish 
is 
gone. 
While 
taking 
a 
walk 
I 
meet 
a 
gentleman 
from 
whom 
I 
receive 
a 
communication. 
On 
returning 
home, 
and 
in 
attending 
to 
weightier 
affairs, 
the 
matter 
slips 
my 
mind. 
Moodily, 
but 
in 
vain, 
I 
ransack 
my 
memory. 
Finally 
I 
observe 
that 
I 
am 
going 
over 
my 
walk 
again 
in 
thought. 
On 
the 
street 
corner 
in 
question 
the 
self-same 
gentleman 
stands 
before 
me 
and 
repeats 
his 
communication. 
In 
this 
process 
are 
successively 
recalled 
to 
consciousness 
all 
the 
percepts 
which 
were 
connected 
with 
the 
percept 
that 
was 
lost, 
and 
with 
them, 
finally, 
that, 



too, 
is 
brought 
to 
light. 
In 
the 
first 
case—where 
the 
experience 
had 
already 
been 
made 
and 
is 
permanently 
impressed 
on 
our 
thought—a 
systematic 
procedure 
is 
both 
possible 
and 
easy, 
for 
we 
know 
that 
a 
name 
must 
be 
composed 
of 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
sounds. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
should 
be 
observed 
that 
the 
labor 
involved 
in 
such 
a 
combinatorial 
task 
would 
be 
enormous 
if 
the 
name 
were 
long 
and 
the 
responsiveness 
of 
the 
mind 
weaker. 


It 
is 
often 
said, 
and 
not 
wholly 
without 
justification, 
that 
the 
scientist 
has 
solved 
a 
riddle. 
Every 
problem 
in 
geometry 
may 
be 
clothed 
in 
the 
garb 
of 
a 
riddle. 
Thus: 
"What 
thing 
is 
that 
M 
which 
has 
the 
properties 
A, 
B, 
C?" 
"What 
circle 
is 
that 
which 
touches 
the 
straight 
lines 
A, 
B, 
but 
touches 
B 
in 
the 
point 
C?" 
The 
first 
two 
conditions 
marshal 
before 
the 
imagination 
the 
group 
of 
circles 
whose 
centres 
lie 
in 
the 
line 
of 
symmetry 
of 
A, 
B. 
The 
third 
condition 
reminds 
us 
of 
all 
the 
circles 
having 
centres 
in 
the 
straight 
line 
that 
stands 
at 
right 
angles 
to 
B 
in 
C. 
The 
common 
term, 
or 
common 
terms, 
of 
the 
two 
groups 
of 
images 
solves 
the 
riddle—satisfies 
the 
problem. 
Puzzles 
dealing 
with 
things 
or 
words 
induce 
similar 
processes, 
but 
the 
memory 
in 
such 
cases 
is 
exerted 
in 
many 
directions 
and 
more 
varied 
and 
less 
clearly 
ordered 
provinces 
of 
ideas 
are 
surveyed. 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
situation 
of 
a 
geometer 
who 
has 
a 
construction 
to 
make, 
and 
that 
of 
an 
engineer, 
or 
a 
scientist, 
confronted 
with 
a 
problem, 
is 
simply 
this, 
that 
the 
first 
moves 
in 
a 
field 
with 
which 
he 
is 
thoroughly 
acquainted, 
whereas 
the 
two 
latter 
are 
obliged 
to 
familiarise 
themselves 
with 
this 
field 
subsequently, 
and 
in 
a 
measure 
far 
transcending 
what 
is 
commonly 
required. 
In 
this 
process 
the 
mechanical 
engineer 
has 
at 
least 
always 
a 
definite 
goal 
before 
him 
and 
definite 
means 
to 
accomplish 
his 
aim, 
whilst 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
scientist 
that 
aim 
is 
in 
many 
instances 
presented 
only 
in 
vague 
and 
general 
outlines. 
Often 
the 
very 
formulation 
of 
the 
riddle 
devolves 
on 
him. 
Frequently 
it 
is 
not 
until 
the 
aim 
has 
been 
reached 
that 
the 
broader 
outlook 
requisite 
for 
systematic 
procedure 
is 
obtained. 
By 
far 
the 
larger 
portion 
of 
his 
success, 
therefore, 
is 
contingent 
on 
luck 
and 
instinct. 
It 
is 
immaterial, 
so 
far 
as 
its 
character 
is 
concerned, 
whether 
the 
process 
in 
question 
is 
brought 
rapidly 
to 
a 
conclusion 
in 
the 
brain 
of 
one 
man, 
or 
whether 
it 
is 
spun 
out 
for 
centuries 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
a 
long 
succession 
of 
thinkers. 
The 
same 
relation 
that 
a 
word 
solving 
a 
riddle 
bears 
to 
that 
riddle 
is 
borne 
by 
the 
modern 
conception 
of 
light 
to 
the 
facts 
discovered 
by 
Grimaldi, 
Römer, 
Huygens, 
Newton, 
Young, 
Malus, 
and 
Fresnel, 
and 
only 
by 
the 
help 
of 
this 
slowly 
developed 
conception 
is 
our 



mental 
vision 
enabled 
to 
embrace 
the 
broad 
domain 
of 
facts 
in 
question. 


A 
welcome 
complement 
to 
the 
discoveries 
which 
the 
history 
of 
civilisation 
and 
comparative 
psychology 
have 
furnished, 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
confessions 
of 
great 
scientists 
and 
artists. 
Scientists 
and 
artists, 
we 
might 
say, 
for 
Liebig 
boldly 
declared 
there 
was 
no 
essential 
difference 
between 
the 
two. 
Are 
we 
to 
regard 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci 
as 
a 
scientist 
or 
as 
an 
artist? 
If 
the 
artist 
builds 
up 
his 
work 
from 
a 
few 
motives, 
the 
scientist 
discovers 
the 
motives 
which 
permeate 
reality. 
If 
scientists 
like 
Lagrange 
or 
Fourier 
are 
in 
a 
certain 
measure 
artists 
in 
the 
presentation 
of 
their 
results, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
artists 
like 
Shakespeare 
or 
Ruysdael 
are 
scientists 
in 
the 
insight 
which 
must 
have 
preceded 
their 
creations. 


Newton, 
when 
questioned 
about 
his 
methods 
of 
work, 
could 
give 
no 
other 
answer 
but 
that 
he 
was 
wont 
to 
ponder 
again 
and 
again 
on 
a 
subject; 
and 
similar 
utterances 
are 
accredited 
to 
D'Alembert 
and 
Helmholtz. 
Scientists 
and 
artists 
both 
recommend 
persistent 
labor. 
After 
the 
repeated 
survey 
of 
a 
field 
has 
afforded 
opportunity 
for 
the 
interposition 
of 
advantageous 
accidents, 
has 
rendered 
all 
the 
traits 
that 
suit 
with 
the 
mood 
or 
the 
dominant 
thought 
more 
vivid, 
and 
has 
gradually 
relegated 
to 
the 
background 
all 
things 
that 
are 
inappropriate, 
making 
their 
future 
appearance 
impossible; 
then 
from 
the 
teeming, 
swelling 
host 
of 
fancies 
which 
a 
free 
and 
high-flown 
imagination 
calls 
forth, 
suddenly 
that 
particular 
form 
arises 
to 
the 
light 
which 
harmonises 
perfectly 
with 
the 
ruling 
idea, 
mood, 
or 
design. 
Then 
it 
is 
that 
that 
which 
has 
resulted 
slowly 
as 
the 
result 
of 
a 
gradual 
selection, 
appears 
as 
if 
it 
were 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
deliberate 
act 
of 
creation. 
Thus 
are 
to 
be 
explained 
the 
statements 
of 
Newton, 
Mozart, 
Richard 
Wagner, 
and 
others, 
when 
they 
say 
that 
thoughts, 
melodies, 
and 
harmonies 
had 
poured 
in 
upon 
them, 
and 
that 
they 
had 
simply 
retained 
the 
right 
ones. 
Undoubtedly, 
the 
man 
of 
genius, 
too, 
consciously 
or 
instinctively, 
pursues 
systematic 
methods 
wherever 
it 
is 
possible; 
but 
in 
his 
delicate 
presentiment 
he 
will 
omit 
many 
a 
task 
or 
abandon 
it 
after 
a 
hasty 
trial 
on 
which 
a 
less 
endowed 
man 
would 
squander 
his 
energies 
in 
vain. 
Thus, 
the 
genius 
accomplishes 
[91] 
in 
a 
brief 
space 
of 
time 
undertakings 
for 
which 
the 
life 
of 
an 
ordinary 
man 
would 
far 
from 
suffice. 
We 
shall 
hardly 
go 
astray 
if 
we 
regard 
genius 
as 
only 
a 
slight 
deviation 
from 
the 
average 
mental 
endowment—as 
possessing 
simply 
a 
greater 
sensitiveness 
of 
cerebral 
reaction 
and 
a 
greater 
swiftness 
of 
reaction. 
The 
men 
who, 



obeying 
their 
inner 
impulses, 
make 
sacrifices 
for 
an 
idea 
instead 
of 
advancing 
their 
material 
welfare, 
may 
appear 
to 
the 
full-blooded 
Philistine 
as 
fools; 
yet 
we 
shall 
scarcely 
adopt 
Lombroso's 
view, 
that 
genius 
is 
to 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
disease, 
although 
it 
is 
unfortunately 
true 
that 
the 
sensitive 
brains 
and 
fragile 
constitutions 
succumb 
most 
readily 
to 
sickness. 


The 
remark 
of 
C. 
G. 
J. 
Jacobi 
that 
mathematics 
is 
slow 
of 
growth 
and 
only 
reaches 
the 
truth 
by 
long 
and 
devious 
paths, 
that 
the 
way 
to 
its 
discovery 
must 
be 
prepared 
for 
long 
beforehand, 
and 
that 
then 
the 
truth 
will 
make 
its 
long-deferred 
appearance 
as 
if 
impelled 
by 
some 
divine 
necessity 
[92]—all 
this 
holds 
true 
of 
every 
science. 
We 
are 
astounded 
often 
to 
note 
that 
it 
required 
the 
combined 
labors 
of 
many 
eminent 
thinkers 
for 
a 
full 
century 
to 
reach 
a 
truth 
which 
it 
takes 
us 
only 
a 
few 
hours 
to 
master 
and 
which 
once 
acquired 
seems 
extremely 
easy 
to 
reach 
under 
the 
right 
sort 
of 
circumstances. 
To 
our 
humiliation 
we 
learn 
that 
even 
the 
greatest 
men 
are 
born 
more 
for 
life 
than 
for 
science. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
even 
they 
are 
indebted 
to 
accident—to 
that 
singular 
conflux 
of 
the 
physical 
and 
the 
psychical 
life 
in 
which 
the 
continuous 
but 
yet 
imperfect 
and 
never-ending 
adaptation 
of 
the 
latter 
to 
the 
former 
finds 
its 
distinct 
expression—that 
has 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
our 
remarks 
to-day. 
Jacobi's 
poetical 
thought 
of 
a 
divine 
necessity 
acting 
in 
science 
will 
lose 
none 
of 
its 
loftiness 
for 
us 
if 
we 
discover 
in 
this 
necessity 
the 
same 
power 
that 
destroys 
the 
unfit 
and 
fosters 
the 
fit. 
For 
loftier, 
nobler, 
and 
more 
romantic 
than 
poetry 
is 
the 
truth 
and 
the 
reality. 



ON 
SENSATIONS 
OF 
ORIENTATION. 
[93] 


Through 
the 
co-operation 
of 
a 
succession 
of 
inquirers, 
among 
whom 
are 
particularly 
to 
be 
mentioned 
Goltz 
of 
Strassburg 
and 
Breuer 
of 
Vienna, 
considerable 
advances 
have 
been 
made 
during 
the 
last 
twenty-five 
years 
in 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
means 
by 
which 
we 
ascertain 
our 
position 
in 
space 
and 
the 
direction 
of 
our 
motion, 
or 
orient 
ourselves, 
as 
the 
phrase 
goes. 
I 
presume 
that 
you 
are 
already 
acquainted 
with 
the 
physiological 
part 
of 
the 
processes 
with 
which 
our 
sensations 
of 
movement, 
or, 
more 
generally 
speaking, 
our 
sensations 
of 
orientation, 
are 
connected. 
Here 
I 
shall 
consider 
more 
particularly 
the 
physical 
side 
of 
the 
matter. 
In 
fact, 
I 
was 
originally 
led 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
these 
questions 
by 
the 
observation 
of 
extremely 
simple 
and 
perfectly 
well-known 
physical 
facts, 
before 
I 
had 
any 
great 
acquaintance 
with 
physiology 
and 
while 
pursuing 
unbiasedly 
my 
natural 
thoughts; 
and 
I 
am 
of 
the 
conviction 
that 
the 
way 
which 
I 
have 
pursued, 
and 
which 
is 
entirely 
free 
from 
hypotheses, 
will, 
if 
you 
will 
follow 
my 
exposition, 
be 
that 
of 
easiest 
acquisition 
for 
the 
most 
of 
you. 


No 
man 
of 
sound 
common 
sense 
could 
ever 
have 
doubted 
that 
a 
pressure 
or 
force 
is 
requisite 
to 
set 
a 
body 
in 
motion 
in 
a 
given 
direction 
and 
that 
a 
contrary 
pressure 
is 
required 
to 
stop 
suddenly 
a 
body 
in 
motion. 
Though 
the 
law 
of 
inertia 
was 
first 
formulated 
with 
anything 
like 
exactness 
by 
Galileo, 
the 
facts 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
it 
were 
known 
long 
previously 
to 
men 
of 
the 
stamp 
of 
Leonardo 
da 
Vinci, 
Rabelais, 
and 
others, 
and 
were 
illustrated 
by 
them 
with 
appropriate 
experiments. 
Leonardo 
knew 
that 
by 
a 
swift 
stroke 
with 
a 
ruler 
one 
can 
knock 
out 
from 
a 
vertical 
column 
of 
checkers 
a 
single 
checker 
without 
over-throwing 
the 
column. 
The 
experiment 
with 
a 
coin 
resting 
on 
a 
piece 
of 
pasteboard 
covering 
a 
goblet, 
which 
falls 
into 
the 
goblet 
when 
the 
pasteboard 
is 
jerked 
away, 
like 
all 
experiments 
of 
the 
kind, 
is 
certainly 
very 
old. 


With 
Galileo 
the 
experience 
in 
question 
assumes 
greater 
clearness 
and 
force. 
In 
the 
famous 
dialogue 
on 
the 
Copernican 
system 
which 
cost 
him 
his 
freedom, 
he 
explains 
the 
tides 
in 
an 
unfelicitous, 
though 
in 
principle 
correct 



manner, 
by 
the 
analogue 
of 
a 
platter 
of 
water 
swung 
to 
and 
fro. 
In 
opposition 
to 
the 
Aristotelians 
of 
his 
time, 
who 
believed 
the 
descent 
of 
a 
heavy 
body 
could 
be 
accelerated 
by 
the 
superposition 
of 
another 
heavy 
body, 
he 
asserted 
that 
a 
body 
could 
never 
be 
accelerated 
by 
one 
lying 
upon 
it 
unless 
the 
first 
in 
some 
way 
impeded 
the 
superposed 
body 
in 
its 
descent. 
To 
seek 
to 
press 
a 
falling 
body 
by 
means 
of 
another 
placed 
upon 
it, 
is 
as 
senseless 
as 
trying 
to 
prod 
a 
man 
with 
a 
lance 
when 
the 
man 
is 
speeding 
away 
from 
one 
with 
the 
same 
velocity 
as 
the 
lance. 
Even 
this 
little 
excursion 
into 
physics 
can 
explain 
much 
to 
us. 
You 
know 
the 
peculiar 
sensation 
which 
one 
has 
in 
falling, 
as 
when 
one 
jumps 
from 
a 
high 
springboard 
into 
the 
water, 
and 
which 
is 
also 
experienced 
in 
some 
measure 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
descent 
of 
elevators 
and 
swings. 
The 
reciprocal 
gravitational 
pressure 
of 
the 
different 
parts 
of 
our 
body, 
which 
is 
certainly 
felt 
in 
some 
manner, 
vanishes 
in 
free 
descent, 
or, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
elevator, 
is 
diminished 
on 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
descent. 
A 
similar 
sensation 
would 
be 
experienced 
if 
we 
were 
suddenly 
transported 
to 
the 
moon 
where 
the 
acceleration 
of 
gravity 
is 
much 
less 
than 
upon 
the 
earth. 
I 
was 
led 
to 
these 
considerations 
in 
1866 
by 
a 
suggestion 
in 
physics, 
and 
having 
also 
taken 
into 
account 
the 
alterations 
of 
the 
blood-pressure 
in 
the 
cases 
in 
question, 
I 
found 
I 
coincided 
without 
knowing 
it 
with 
Wollaston 
and 
Purkinje. 
The 
first 
as 
early 
as 
1810 
in 
his 
Croonian 
lecture 
had 
touched 
on 
the 
subject 
of 
sea-sickness 
and 
explained 
it 
by 
alterations 
of 
the 
blood-pressure, 
and 
later 
had 
laid 
similar 
considerations 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
his 
explanation 
of 
vertigo 
(1820-1826). 
[94] 


Newton 
was 
the 
first 
to 
enunciate 
with 
perfect 
generality 
that 
a 
body 
can 
change 
the 
velocity 
and 
direction 
of 
its 
motion 
only 
by 
the 
action 
of 
a 
force, 
or 
the 
action 
of 
a 
second 
body. 
A 
corollary 
of 
this 
law 
which 
was 
first 
expressly 
deduced 
by 
Euler 
is 
that 
a 
body 
can 
never 
be 
set 
rotating 
or 
made 
to 
cease 
rotating 
of 
itself 
but 
only 
by 
forces 
and 
other 
bodies. 
For 
example, 
turn 
an 
open 
watch 
which 
has 
run 
down 
freely 
backwards 
and 
forwards 
in 
your 
hand. 
The 
balance-wheel 
will 
not 
fully 
catch 
the 
rapid 
rotations, 
it 
does 
not 
even 
respond 
fully 
to 
the 
elastic 
force 
of 
the 
spring 
which 
proves 
too 
weak 
to 
carry 
the 
wheel 
entirely 
with 
it. 


Let 
us 
consider 
now 
that 
whether 
we 
move 
ourselves 
by 
means 
of 
our 
legs, 
or 
whether 
we 
are 
moved 
by 
a 
vehicle 
or 
a 
boat, 
at 
first 
only 
a 
part 
of 
our 
body 
is 
directly 
moved 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
it 
is 
afterwards 
set 
in 
motion 
by 
the 
first 
part. 



We 
see 
that 
pressures, 
pulls, 
and 
tensions 
are 
always 
produced 
between 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
in 
this 
action, 
which 
pressures, 
pulls, 
and 
tensions 
give 
rise 
to 
sensations 
by 
which 
the 
forward 
or 
rotary 
movements 
in 
which 
we 
are 
engaged 
are 
made 
perceptible. 
[95] 
But 
it 
is 
quite 
natural 
that 
sensations 
so 
familiar 
should 
be 
little 
noticed 
and 
that 
attention 
should 
be 
drawn 
to 
them 
only 
under 
special 
circumstances 
when 
they 
occur 
unexpectedly 
or 
with 
unusual 
strength. 


Thus 
my 
attention 
was 
drawn 
to 
this 
point 
by 
the 
sensation 
of 
falling 
and 
subsequently 
by 
another 
singular 
occurrence. 
I 
was 
rounding 
a 
sharp 
railway 
curve 
once 
when 
I 
suddenly 
saw 
all 
the 
trees, 
houses, 
and 
factory 
chimneys 
along 
the 
track 
swerve 
from 
the 
vertical 
and 
assume 
a 
strikingly 
inclined 
position. 
What 
had 
hitherto 
appeared 
to 
me 
perfectly 
natural, 
namely, 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
distinguish 
the 
vertical 
so 
perfectly 
and 
sharply 
from 
every 
other 
direction, 
now 
struck 
me 
as 
enigmatical. 
Why 
is 
it 
that 
the 
same 
direction 
can 
now 
appear 
vertical 
to 
me 
and 
now 
cannot? 
By 
what 
is 
the 
vertical 
distinguished 
for 
us? 
(Compare 
Figure 
45.) 


The 
rails 
are 
raised 
on 
the 
convex 
or 
outward 
side 
of 
the 
track 
in 
order 
to 
insure 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
carriage 
as 
against 
the 
action 
of 
the 
centrifugal 
force, 
the 
whole 
being 
so 
arranged 
that 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
force 
of 
gravity 
with 
the 
centrifugal 
force 
of 
the 
train 
shall 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
force 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
rails. 


Let 
us 
assume, 
now, 
that 
under 
all 
circumstances 
we 
somehow 
sense 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
total 
resultant 
mass-acceleration 
whencesoever 
it 
may 
arise 
as 
the 
vertical. 
Then 
both 
the 
ordinary 
and 
the 
extraordinary 
phenomena 
will 
be 
alike 
rendered 
intelligible. 
[96] 


I 
was 
now 
desirous 
of 
putting 
the 
view 
I 
had 
reached 
to 
a 
more 
convenient 
and 
exact 
test 
than 
was 
possible 
on 
a 
railway 
journey 
where 
one 
has 
no 
control 
over 
the 
determining 
circumstances 
and 
cannot 
alter 
them 
at 
will. 
I 
accordingly 
had 
the 
simple 
apparatus 
constructed 
which 
is 
represented 
in 
Figure 
46. 


In 
a 
large 
frame 
BB, 
which 
is 
fastened 
to 
the 
walls, 
rotates 
about 
a 
vertical 
axis 
AA 
a 
second 
frame 
RR, 
and 
within 
the 
latter 
a 
third 
one 
rr, 
which 
can 
be 
set 
at 
any 
distance 
and 
position 
from 
the 
axis, 
made 
stationary 
or 
movable, 



and 
is 
provided 
with 
a 
chair 
for 
the 
observer. 


From 
Mach's 
Bewegungsempfindungen, 
Leipsic, 
Engelmann, 
1875.] 


The 
observer 
takes 
his 
seat 
in 
the 
chair 
and 
to 
prevent 
disturbances 
of 
judgment 
is 
enclosed 
in 
a 
paper 
box. 
If 
the 
observer 
together 
with 
the 
frame 
rr 
be 
then 
set 
in 
uniform 
rotation, 
he 
will 
feel 
and 
see 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
rotation 
both 
as 
to 
direction 
and 
amount 
very 
distinctly 
although 
every 
outward 
visible 
or 
tangible 
point 
of 
reference 
is 
wanting. 
If 
the 
motion 
be 
uniformly 
continued 
the 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
will 
gradually 
cease 
entirely 
and 
the 
observer 
will 
imagine 
himself 
at 
rest. 
But 
if 
rr 
be 
placed 
outside 
the 
axis 
of 
rotation, 
at 
once 
on 
the 
rotation 
beginning, 
a 
strikingly 
apparent, 
palpable, 
actually 
visible 
inclination 
of 
the 
entire 
paper 
box 
is 
produced, 
slight 
when 
the 
rotation 
is 
slow, 
strong 
when 
the 
rotation 
is 
rapid, 
and 
continuing 
as 
long 
as 
the 
rotation 
lasts. 
It 
is 
absolutely 
impossible 
for 
the 
observer 
to 
escape 
perceiving 
the 
inclination, 
although 
here 
also 
all 
outward 
points 
of 
reference 
are 
wanting. 
If 
the 
observer, 
for 
example, 
is 
seated 
so 
as 
to 
look 
towards 
the 
axis, 
he 
will 
feel 
the 
box 
strongly 
tipped 
backwards, 
as 
it 
necessarily 
must 
be 
if 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
total 
resultant 
force 
is 
perceived 
as 
the 
vertical. 
For 
other 
positions 
of 
the 
observer 
the 
situation 
is 
similar. 
[97] 


Once, 
while 
performing 
one 
of 
these 
experiments, 
and 
after 
rotating 
so 
long 
that 
I 
was 
no 
longer 
conscious 
of 
the 
movement, 
I 
suddenly 
caused 
the 
apparatus 
to 
be 
stopped, 
whereupon 
I 
immediately 
felt 
and 
saw 
myself 
with 
the 
whole 
box 
rapidly 
flung 
round 
in 
rotation 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
although 
I 
knew 
that 
the 
whole 
apparatus 
was 
at 
rest 
and 
every 
outward 
point 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
perception 
of 
motion 
was 
wanting. 
Every 
one 
who 
disbelieves 
in 
sensations 
of 
movement 
should 
be 
made 
acquainted 
with 
these 
phenomena. 
Had 
Newton 
known 
them 
and 
had 
he 
ever 
observed 
how 
we 
may 
actually 
imagine 
ourselves 
turned 
and 
displaced 
in 
space 
without 
the 
assistance 
of 
stationary 
bodies 
as 
points 
of 
reference, 
he 
would 
certainly 
have 
been 
confirmed 
more 
than 
ever 
in 
his 
unfortunate 
speculations 
regarding 
absolute 
space. 


The 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction 
after 
the 
apparatus 
has 
been 
stopped, 
slowly 
and 
gradually 
ceases. 
But 
on 
accidentally 
inclining 
my 
head 
once 
during 
this 
occurrence, 
the 
axis 
of 
apparent 
rotation 
was 
also 
observed 
to 
incline 
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
manner 
both 
as 
to 
direction 
and 
as 
to 



amount. 
It 
is 
accordingly 
clear 
that 
the 
acceleration 
or 
retardation 
of 
rotation 
is 
felt. 
The 
acceleration 
operates 
as 
a 
stimulus. 
The 
sensation, 
however, 
like 
almost 
all 
sensations, 
though 
it 
gradually 
decreases, 
lasts 
perceptibly 
longer 
than 
the 
stimulus. 
Hence 
the 
long 
continued 
apparent 
rotation 
after 
the 
stopping 
of 
the 
apparatus. 
The 
organ, 
however, 
which 
causes 
the 
persistence 
of 
this 
sensation 
must 
have 
its 
seat 
in 
the 
head, 
since 
otherwise 
the 
axis 
of 
apparent 
rotation 
could 
not 
assume 
the 
same 
motion 
as 
the 
head. 


If 
I 
were 
to 
say, 
now, 
that 
a 
light 
had 
flashed 
upon 
me 
in 
making 
these 
last 
observations, 
the 
expression 
would 
be 
a 
feeble 
one. 
I 
ought 
to 
say 
I 
experienced 
a 
perfect 
illumination. 
My 
juvenile 
experiences 
of 
vertigo 
occurred 
to 
me. 
I 
remembered 
Flourens's 
experiments 
relative 
to 
the 
section 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals 
of 
the 
labyrinths 
of 
doves 
and 
rabbits, 
where 
this 
inquirer 
had 
observed 
phenomena 
similar 
to 
vertigo, 
but 
which 
he 
preferred 
to 
interpret, 
from 
his 
bias 
to 
the 
acoustic 
theory 
of 
the 
labyrinth, 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
painful 
auditive 
disturbances. 
I 
saw 
that 
Goltz 
had 
nearly 
but 
not 
quite 
hit 
the 
bull's 
eye 
with 
his 
theory 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals. 
This 
inquirer, 
who, 
from 
his 
happy 
habit 
of 
following 
his 
own 
natural 
thoughts 
without 
regard 
for 
tradition, 
has 
cleared 
up 
so 
much 
in 
science, 
spoke, 
as 
early 
as 
1870, 
on 
the 
ground 
of 
experiments, 
as 
follows: 
"It 
is 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
semi-circular 
canals 
are 
auditive 
organs 
or 
not. 
In 
any 
event 
they 
form 
an 
apparatus 
which 
serves 
for 
the 
preservation 
of 
equilibrium. 
They 
are, 
so 
to 
speak, 
the 
sense-organs 
of 
equilibrium 
of 
the 
head 
and 
indirectly 
of 
the 
whole 
body." 
I 
remembered 
the 
galvanic 
dizziness 
which 
had 
been 
observed 
by 
Ritter 
and 
Purkinje 
on 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
current 
through 
the 
head, 
when 
the 
persons 
experimented 
upon 
imagined 
they 
were 
falling 
towards 
the 
cathode. 
The 
experiment 
was 
immediately 
repeated, 
and 
sometime 
later 
(1874) 
I 
was 
enabled 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
same 
objectively 
with 
fishes, 
all 
of 
which 
placed 
themselves 
sidewise 
and 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
current 
as 
if 
at 
command. 
[98] 
Müller's 
doctrine 
of 
specific 
energies 
now 
appeared 
to 
me 
to 
bring 
all 
these 
new 
and 
old 
observations 
into 
a 
simple, 
connected 
unity. 


The 
labyrinth 
of 
a 
dove 
(stereoscopically 
reproduced), 
from

Ewald,

Let 
us 
picture 
to 
ourselves 
the 
labyrinth 
of 
the 
ear 
with 
its 
three 
semi-circular 
canals 
lying 
in 
three 
mutually 
perpendicular 
planes 
(Comp. 
Fig. 
47), 
the 



mysterious 
position 
of 
which 
inquirers 
have 
endeavored 
to 
explain 
in 
every 
possible 
and 
impossible 
way. 
Let 
us 
conceive 
the 
nerves 
of 
the 
ampullæ, 
or 
the 
dilated 
extensions 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals, 
equipped 
with 
a 
capacity 
for 
responding 
to 
every 
imaginable 
stimulus 
with 
a 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
just 
as 
the 
nerves 
of 
the 
retina 
of 
the 
eye 
when 
excited 
by 
pressures, 
by 
electrical 
or 
chemical 
stimuli 
always 
respond 
with 
the 
sensation 
of 
light; 
let 
us 
picture 
to 
ourselves, 
further, 
that 
the 
usual 
excitation 
of 
the 
ampullæ 
nerves 
is 
produced 
by 
the 
inertia 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals, 
which 
contents 
on 
suitable 
rotations 
in 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canal 
are 
left 
behind 
in 
the 
motion, 
or 
at 
least 
have 
a 
tendency 
to 
remain 
behind 
and 
consequently 
exert 
a 
pressure. 
It 
will 
be 
seen 
that 
on 
this 
supposition 
all 
the 
single 
facts 
which 
without 
the 
theory 
appear 
as 
so 
many 
different 
individual 
phenomena, 
become 
from 
this 
single 
point 
of 
view 
clear 
and 
intelligible. 


I 
had 
the 
satisfaction, 
immediately 
after 
the 
communication 
in 
which 
I 
set 
forth 
this 
idea, 
[99] 
of 
seeing 
a 
paper 
by 
Breuer 
appear 
[100] 
in 
which 
this 
author 
had 
arrived 
by 
entirely 
different 
methods 
at 
results 
that 
agreed 
in 
all 
essential 
points 
with 
my 
own. 
A 
few 
weeks 
later 
appeared 
the 
researches 
of 
Crum 
Brown 
of 
Edinburgh, 
whose 
methods 
were 
even 
still 
nearer 
mine. 
Breuer's 
paper 
was 
far 
richer 
in 
physiological 
respects 
than 
mine, 
and 
he 
had 
particularly 
gone 
into 
greater 
detail 
in 
his 
investigation 
of 
the 
collateral 
effects 
of 
the 
reflex 
motions 
and 
orientation 
of 
the 
eyes 
in 
the 
phenomena 
under 
consideration. 
[101] 
In 
addition 
certain 
experiments 
which 
I 
had 
suggested 
in 
my 
paper 
as 
a 
test 
of 
the 
correctness 
of 
the 
view 
in 
question 
had 
already 
been 
performed 
by 
Breuer. 
Breuer 
has 
also 
rendered 
services 
of 
the 
highest 
order 
in 
the 
further 
elaboration 
of 
this 
field. 
But 
in 
a 
physical 
regard, 
my 
paper 
was, 
of 
course, 
more 
complete. 


In 
order 
to 
portray 
to 
the 
eye 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals, 
I 
have 
constructed 
here 
a 
little 
apparatus. 
(See 
Fig. 
48.) 
The 
large 
rotatable 
disc 
represents 
the 
osseous 
semi-circular 
canal, 
which 
is 
continuous 
with 
the 
bones 
of 
the 
head; 
the 
small 
disc, 
which 
is 
free 
to 
rotate 
on 
the 
axis 
of 
the 
first, 
represents 
the 
mobile 
and 
partly 
liquid 
contents 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canal. 
On 
rotating 
the 
large 
disc, 
the 
small 
disc 
as 
you 
see 
remains 
behind. 
I 
have 
to 
turn 
some 
time 
before 
the 
small 
disc 
is 
carried 
along 
with 
the 
large 
one 
by 
friction. 
But 
if 
I 
now 
stop 
the 
large 
disc 
the 
small 
disc 
as 
you 
see 
continues 
to 
rotate. 



Model 
representing 
the 
action 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals.] 


Simply 
assume 
now 
that 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
small 
disc, 
say 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
watch, 
would 
give 
rise 
to 
a 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction, 
and 
conversely, 
and 
you 
already 
understand 
a 
good 
portion 
of 
the 
facts 
above 
set 
forth. 
The 
explanation 
still 
holds, 
even 
if 
the 
small 
disc 
does 
not 
perform 
appreciable 
rotations 
but 
is 
checked 
by 
a 
contrivance 
similar 
to 
an 
elastic 
spring, 
the 
tension 
of 
which 
disengages 
a 
sensation. 
Conceive, 
now, 
three 
such 
contrivances 
with 
their 
mutually 
perpendicular 
planes 
of 
rotation 
joined 
together 
so 
as 
to 
form 
a 
single 
apparatus; 
then 
to 
this 
apparatus 
as 
a 
whole, 
no 
rotation 
can 
be 
imparted 
without 
its 
being 
indicated 
by 
the 
small 
mobile 
discs 
or 
by 
the 
springs 
which 
are 
attached 
to 
them. 
Conceive 
both 
the 
right 
and 
the 
left 
ear 
equipped 
with 
such 
an 
apparatus, 
and 
you 
will 
find 
that 
it 
answers 
all 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals, 
which 
you 
see 
represented 
stereoscopically 
in 
Fig. 
47 
for 
the 
ear 
of 
a 
dove. 


Of 
the 
many 
experiments 
which 
I 
have 
made 
on 
my 
own 
person, 
and 
the 
results 
of 
which 
could 
be 
predicted 
by 
the 
new 
view 
according 
to 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
model 
and 
consequently 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
mechanics, 
I 
shall 
cite 
but 
one. 
I 
fasten 
a 
horizontal 
board 
in 
the 
frame 
RR 
of 
my 
rotatory 
apparatus, 
lie 
down 
upon 
the 
same 
with 
my 
right 
ear 
upon 
the 
board, 
and 
cause 
the 
apparatus 
to 
be 
uniformly 
rotated. 
As 
soon 
as 
I 
no 
longer 
perceive 
the 
rotation, 
I 
turn 
around 
upon 
my 
left 
ear 
and 
immediately 
the 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
again 
starts 
up 
with 
marked 
vividness. 
The 
experiment 
can 
be 
repeated 
as 
often 
as 
one 
wishes. 
A 
slight 
turn 
of 
the 
head 
even 
is 
sufficient 
for 
reviving 
the 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
which 
in 
the 
perfectly 
quiescent 
state 
at 
once 
disappears 
altogether. 


We 
will 
imitate 
the 
experiment 
on 
the 
model. 
I 
turn 
the 
large 
disc 
until 
finally 
the 
small 
disc 
is 
carried 
along 
with 
it. 
If, 
now, 
while 
the 
rotation 
continues 
uniform, 
I 
burn 
off 
a 
little 
thread 
which 
you 
see 
here, 
the 
small 
disc 
will 
be 
flipped 
round 
by 
a 
spring 
into 
its 
own 
plane 
180°, 
so 
as 
now 
to 
present 
its 
opposite 
side 
to 
you, 
when 
the 
rotation 
at 
once 
begins 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction. 


We 
have 
consequently 
a 
very 
simple 
means 
for 
determining 
whether 
one 
is 
actually 
the 
subject 
or 
not 
of 
uniform 
and 
imperceptible 
rotations. 
If 
the 
earth 
rotated 
much 
more 
rapidly 
than 
it 
really 
does, 
or 
if 
our 
semi-circular 
canals 



were 
much 
more 
sensitive, 
a 
Nansen 
sleeping 
at 
the 
North 
Pole 
would 
be 
waked 
by 
a 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
every 
time 
he 
turned 
over. 
Foucault's 
pendulum 
experiment 
as 
a 
demonstration 
of 
the 
earth's 
rotation 
would 
be 
superfluous 
under 
such 
circumstances. 
The 
only 
reason 
we 
cannot 
prove 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
earth 
with 
the 
help 
of 
our 
model, 
lies 
in 
the 
small 
angular 
velocity 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
in 
the 
consequent 
liability 
to 
great 
experimental 
errors. 
[102] 


Aristotle 
has 
said 
that 
"The 
sweetest 
of 
all 
things 
is 
knowledge." 
And 
he 
is 
right. 
But 
if 
you 
were 
to 
suppose 
that 
the 
publication 
of 
a 
new 
view 
were 
productive 
of 
unbounded 
sweetness, 
you 
would 
be 
mightily 
mistaken. 
No 
one 
disturbs 
his 
fellow-men 
with 
a 
new 
view 
unpunished. 
Nor 
should 
the 
fact 
be 
made 
a 
subject 
of 
reproach 
to 
these 
fellow-men. 
To 
presume 
to 
revolutionise 
the 
current 
way 
of 
thinking 
with 
regard 
to 
any 
question, 
is 
no 
pleasant 
task, 
and 
above 
all 
not 
an 
easy 
one. 
They 
who 
have 
advanced 
new 
views 
know 
best 
what 
serious 
difficulties 
stand 
in 
their 
way. 
With 
honest 
and 
praiseworthy 
zeal, 
men 
set 
to 
work 
in 
search 
of 
everything 
that 
does 
not 
suit 
with 
them. 
They 
seek 
to 
discover 
whether 
they 
cannot 
explain 
the 
facts 
better 
or 
as 
well, 
or 
approximately 
as 
well, 
by 
the 
traditional 
views. 
And 
that, 
too, 
is 
justified. 
But 
at 
times 
some 
extremely 
artless 
animadversions 
are 
heard 
that 
almost 
nonplus 
us. 
"If 
a 
sixth 
sense 
existed 
it 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
have 
been 
discovered 
thousands 
of 
years 
ago." 
Indeed; 
there 
was 
a 
time, 
then, 
when 
only 
seven 
planets 
could 
have 
existed! 
But 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
any 
one 
will 
lay 
any 
weight 
on 
the 
philological 
question 
whether 
the 
set 
of 
phenomena 
which 
we 
have 
been 
considering 
should 
be 
called 
a 
sense. 
The 
phenomena 
will 
not 
disappear 
when 
the 
name 
disappears. 
It 
was 
further 
said 
to 
me 
that 
animals 
exist 
which 
have 
no 
labyrinth, 
but 
which 
can 
yet 
orientate 
themselves, 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
labyrinth 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
orientation. 
We 
do 
not 
walk 
forsooth 
with 
our 
legs, 
because 
snakes 
propel 
themselves 
without 
them! 


But 
if 
the 
promulgator 
of 
a 
new 
idea 
cannot 
hope 
for 
any 
great 
pleasure 
from 
its 
publication, 
yet 
the 
critical 
process 
which 
his 
views 
undergo 
is 
extremely 
helpful 
to 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
them. 
All 
the 
defects 
which 
necessarily 
adhere 
to 
the 
new 
view 
are 
gradually 
discovered 
and 
eliminated. 
Over-rating 
and 
exaggeration 
give 
way 
to 
more 
sober 
estimates. 
And 
so 
it 
came 
about 
that 
it 
was 
found 
unpermissible 
to 
attribute 
all 
functions 
of 
orientation 



exclusively 
to 
the 
labyrinth. 
In 
these 
critical 
labors 
Delage, 
Aubert, 
Breuer, 
Ewald, 
and 
others 
have 
rendered 
distinguished 
services. 
It 
can 
also 
not 
fail 
to 
happen 
that 
fresh 
facts 
become 
known 
in 
this 
process 
which 
could 
have 
been 
predicted 
by 
the 
new 
view, 
which 
actually 
were 
predicted 
in 
part, 
and 
which 
consequently 
furnish 
a 
support 
for 
the 
new 
view. 
Breuer 
and 
Ewald 
succeeded 
in 
electrically 
and 
mechanically 
exciting 
the 
labyrinth, 
and 
even 
single 
parts 
of 
the 
labyrinth, 
and 
thus 
in 
producing 
the 
movements 
that 
belong 
to 
such 
stimuli. 
It 
was 
shown 
that 
when 
the 
semi-circular 
canals 
were 
absent 
vertigo 
could 
not 
be 
produced, 
when 
the 
entire 
labyrinth 
was 
removed 
the 
orientation 
of 
the 
head 
was 
no 
longer 
possible, 
that 
without 
the 
labyrinth 
galvanic 
vertigo 
could 
not 
be 
induced. 
I 
myself 
constructed 
as 
early 
as 
1875 
an 
apparatus 
for 
observing 
animals 
in 
rotation, 
which 
was 
subsequently 
reinvented 
in 
various 
forms 
and 
has 
since 
received 
the 
name 
of 
"cyclostat." 


[103] 
In 
experiments 
with 
the 
most 
varied 
kinds 
of 
animals 
it 
was 
shown 
that, 
for 
example, 
the 
larvæ 
of 
frogs 
are 
not 
subject 
to 
vertigo 
until 
their 
semicircular 
canals 
which 
at 
the 
start 
are 
wanting 
are 
developed 
(K. 
Schäfer). 
A 
large 
percentage 
of 
the 
deaf 
and 
dumb 
are 
afflicted 
with 
grave 
affections 
of 
the 
labyrinth. 
The 
American 
psychologist, 
William 
James, 
has 
made 
whirling 
experiments 
with 
many 
deaf 
and 
dumb 
subjects, 
and 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
them 
found 
that 
susceptibility 
to 
giddiness 
is 
wanting. 
He 
also 
found 
that 
many 
deaf 
and 
dumb 
people 
on 
being 
ducked 
under 
water, 
whereby 
they 
lose 
their 
weight 
and 
consequently 
have 
no 
longer 
the 
full 
assistance 
of 
their 
muscular 
sense, 
utterly 
lose 
their 
sense 
of 
position 
in 
space, 
do 
not 
know 
which 
is 
up 
and 
which 
is 
down, 
and 
are 
thrown 
into 
the 
greatest 
consternation,—results 
which 
do 
not 
occur 
in 
normal 
men. 
Such 
facts 
are 
convincing 
proof 
that 
we 
do 
not 
orientate 
ourselves 
entirely 
by 
means 
of 
the 
labyrinth, 
important 
as 
it 
is 
for 
us. 
Dr. 
Kreidl 
has 
made 
experiments 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
James 
and 
found 
that 
not 
only 
is 
vertigo 
absent 
in 
deaf 
and 
dumb 
people 
when 
whirled 
about, 
but 
that 
also 
the 
reflex 
movements 
of 
the 
eyes 
which 
are 
normally 
induced 
by 
the 
labyrinth 
are 
wanting. 
Finally, 
Dr. 
Pollak 
has 
found 
that 
galvanic 
vertigo 
does 
not 
exist 
in 
a 
large 
percentage 
of 
the 
deaf 
and 
dumb. 
Neither 
the 
jerking 
movements 
nor 
the 
uniform 
movements 
of 
the 
eyes 
were 
observed 
which 
normal 
human 
beings 
exhibit 
in 
the 
Ritter 
and 
Purkinje 
experiment. 
After 
the 
physicist 
has 
arrived 
at 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
semi-circular 
canals 
are 
the 
organ 
of 
sensation 
of 
rotation 
or 
of 
angular 
acceleration, 
he 
is 
next 



constrained 
to 
ask 
for 
the 
organs 
that 
mediate 
the 
sensation 
of 
acceleration 
noticed 
in 
forward 
movements. 
In 
searching 
for 
an 
organ 
for 
this 
function, 
he 
of 
course 
is 
not 
apt 
to 
select 
one 
that 
stands 
in 
no 
anatomical 
and 
spatial 
relation 
with 
the 
semi-circular 
canals. 
And 
in 
addition 
there 
are 
physiological 
considerations 
to 
be 
weighed. 
The 
preconceived 
opinion 
once 
having 
been 
abandoned 
that 
the 
entire 
labyrinth 
is 
auditory 
in 
its 
function, 
there 
remains 
after 
the 
cochlea 
is 
reserved 
for 
sensations 
of 
tone 
and 
the 
semi-circular 
canals 
for 
the 
sensation 
of 
angular 
acceleration, 
the 
vestibule 
for 
the 
discharge 
of 
additional 
functions. 
The 
vestibule, 
particularly 
the 
part 
of 
it 
known 
as 
the 
sacculus, 
appeared 
to 
me, 
by 
reason 
of 
the 
so-called 
otoliths 
which 
it 
contains, 
eminently 
adapted 
for 
being 
the 
organ 
of 
sensation 
of 
forward 
acceleration 
or 
of 
the 
position 
of 
the 
head. 
In 
this 
conjecture 
I 
again 
closely 
coincided 
with 
Breuer. 


That 
a 
sensation 
of 
position, 
of 
direction 
and 
amount 
of 
mass-acceleration 
exists, 
our 
experience 
in 
elevators 
as 
well 
as 
of 
movement 
in 
curved 
paths 
is 
sufficient 
proof. 
I 
have 
also 
attempted 
to 
produce 
and 
destroy 
suddenly 
great 
velocities 
of 
forward 
movement 
by 
means 
of 
various 
contrivances 
of 
which 
I 
shall 
mention 
only 
one 
here. 
If, 
while 
enclosed 
in 
the 
paper 
box 
of 
my 
large 
whirling 
apparatus 
at 
some 
distance 
from 
the 
axis, 
my 
body 
is 
in 
uniform 
rotation 
which 
I 
no 
longer 
feel, 
and 
I 
then 
loosen 
the 
connexions 
of 
the 
frame 
rr 
with 
R 
thus 
making 
the 
former 
moveable 
and 
I 
then 
suddenly 
stop 
the 
larger 
frame, 
my 
forward 
motion 
is 
abruptly 
impeded 
while 
the 
frame 
rr 
continues 
to 
rotate. 
I 
imagine 
now 
that 
I 
am 
speeding 
on 
in 
a 
straight 
line 
in 
a 
direction 
opposite 
to 
that 
of 
the 
checked 
motion. 
Unfortunately, 
for 
many 
reasons 
it 
cannot 
be 
proved 
convincingly 
that 
the 
organ 
in 
question 
has 
its 
seat 
in 
the 
head. 
According 
to 
the 
opinion 
of 
Delage, 
the 
labyrinth 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
this 
particular 
sensation 
of 
movement. 
Breuer, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
organ 
of 
forward 
movement 
in 
man 
is 
stunted 
and 
the 
persistence 
of 
the 
sensation 
in 
question 
is 
too 
brief 
to 
permit 
our 
instituting 
experiments 
as 
obvious 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
rotation. 
In 
fact, 
Crum 
Brown 
once 
observed 
while 
in 
an 
irritated 
condition 
peculiar 
vertical 
phenomena 
in 
his 
own 
person, 
which 
were 
all 
satisfactorily 
explained 
by 
an 
abnormally 
long 
persistence 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
rotation, 
and 
I 
myself 
in 
an 
analogous 
case 
on 
the 
stopping 
of 
a 
railway 
train 
felt 
the 
apparent 
backward 
motion 
in 
striking 
intensity 
and 
for 
an 
unusual 
length 
of 
time. 



There 
is 
no 
doubt 
whatever 
that 
we 
feel 
changes 
of 
vertical 
acceleration, 
and 
it 
will 
appear 
from 
the 
following 
extremely 
probable 
that 
the 
otoliths 
of 
the 
vestibule 
are 
the 
sense-organ 
for 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
mass-acceleration. 
It 
will 
then 
be 
incompatible 
with 
a 
really 
logical 
view 
to 
regard 
the 
latter 
as 
incapable 
of 
sensing 
horizontal 
accelerations. 


In 
the 
lower 
animals 
the 
analogue 
of 
the 
labyrinth 
is 
shrunk 
to 
a 
little 
vesicle 
filled 
with 
a 
liquid 
and 
containing 
tiny 
crystals, 
auditive 
stones, 
or 
otoliths, 
of 
greater 
specific 
gravity, 
suspended 
on 
minute 
hairs. 
These 
crystals 
appear 
physically 
well 
adapted 
for 
indicating 
both 
the 
direction 
of 
gravity 
and 
the 
direction 
of 
incipient 
movements. 
That 
they 
discharge 
the 
former 
function, 
Delage 
was 
the 
first 
to 
convince 
himself 
by 
experiments 
with 
lower 
animals 
which 
on 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
otoliths 
utterly 
lost 
their 
bearings 
and 
could 
no 
longer 
regain 
their 
normal 
position. 
Loeb 
also 
found 
that 
fishes 
without 
labyrinths 
swim 
now 
on 
their 
bellies 
and 
now 
on 
their 
backs. 
But 
the 
most 
remarkable, 
most 
beautiful, 
and 
most 
convincing 
experiment 
is 
that 
which 
Dr. 
Kreidl 
instituted 
with 
crustaceans. 
According 
to 
Hensen, 
certain 
Crustacea 
on 
sloughing 
spontaneously 
introduce 
fine 
grains 
of 
sand 
as 
auditive 
stones 
into 
their 
otolith 
vesicle. 
At 
the 
ingenious 
suggestion 
of 
S. 
Exner, 
Dr. 
Kreidl 
constrained 
some 
of 
these 
animals 
to 
put 
up 
with 
iron 
filings 
(ferrum 
limatum). 
If 
the 
pole 
of 
an 
electro-magnet 
be 
brought 
near 
the 
animal, 
it 
will 
at 
once 
turn 
its 
back 
away 
from 
the 
pole 
accompanying 
the 
movement 
with 
appropriate 
reflex 
motions 
of 
the 
eye 
the 
moment 
the 
current 
is 
closed, 
exactly 
as 
if 
gravity 
had 
been 
brought 
to 
bear 
upon 
the 
animal 
in 
the 
same 
direction 
as 
the 
magnetic 
force. 
[104] 
This, 
in 
fact, 
is 
what 
should 
be 
expected 
from 
the 
function 
ascribed 
to 
the 
otoliths. 
If 
the 
eyes 
be 
covered 
with 
asphalt 
varnish, 
and 
the 
auditive 
sacs 
removed, 
the 
crustaceans 
lose 
their 
sense 
of 
direction 
utterly, 
tumble 
head 
over 
heels, 
lie 
on 
their 
side 
or 
their 
back 
indifferently. 
This 
does 
not 
happen 
when 
the 
eyes 
only 
are 
covered. 
For 
vertebrates, 
Breuer 
has 
demonstrated 
by 
searching 
investigations 
that 
the 
otoliths, 
or 
better, 
statoliths, 
slide 
in 
three 
planes 
parallel 
to 
the 
planes 
of 
the 
semi-circular 
canals, 
and 
are 
consequently 
perfectly 
adapted 
for 
indicating 
changes 
both 
in 
the 
amount 
and 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
mass-acceleration. 
[105] 


I 
have 
already 
remarked 
that 
not 
every 
function 
of 
orientation 
can 
be 
ascribed 
exclusively 
to 
the 
labyrinth. 
The 
deaf 
and 
dumb 
who 
have 
to 
be 
immersed 
in 
water, 
and 
the 
crustaceans 
who 
must 
have 
their 
eyes 
closed 
if 
they 
are 
to 
be 



perfectly 
disorientated, 
are 
proof 
of 
this 
fact. 
I 
saw 
a 
blind 
cat 
at 
Hering's 
laboratory 
which 
to 
one 
who 
was 
not 
a 
very 
attentive 
observer 
behaved 
exactly 
like 
a 
seeing 
cat. 
It 
played 
nimbly 
with 
objects 
rolling 
on 
the 
floor, 
stuck 
its 
head 
inquisitively 
into 
open 
drawers, 
sprang 
dexterously 
upon 
chairs, 
ran 
with 
perfect 
accuracy 
through 
open 
doors, 
and 
never 
bumped 
against 
closed 
ones. 
The 
visual 
sense 
had 
here 
been 
rapidly 
replaced 
by 
the 
tactual 
and 
auditive 
senses. 
And 
it 
appears 
from 
Ewald's 
investigations 
that 
even 
after 
the 
labyrinths 
have 
been 
removed, 
animals 
gradually 
learn 
to 
move 
about 
again 
quite 
in 
the 
normal 
fashion, 
presumably 
because 
the 
eliminated 
function 
of 
the 
labyrinth 
is 
now 
performed 
by 
some 
part 
of 
the 
brain. 
A 
certain 
peculiar 
weakness 
of 
the 
muscles 
alone 
is 
perceptible 
which 
Ewald 
ascribes 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
stimulus 
which 
is 
otherwise 
constantly 
emitted 
by 
the 
labyrinth 
(the 
labyrinth-tonus). 
But 
if 
the 
part 
of 
the 
brain 
which 
discharges 
the 
deputed 
function 
be 
removed, 
the 
animals 
are 
again 
completely 
disorientated 
and 
absolutely 
helpless. 


It 
may 
be 
said 
that 
the 
views 
enunciated 
by 
Breuer, 
Crum 
Brown 
and 
myself 
in 
1873 
and 
1874, 
and 
which 
are 
substantially 
a 
fuller 
and 
richer 
development 
of 
Goltz's 
idea, 
have 
upon 
the 
whole 
been 
substantiated. 
At 
least 
they 
have 
exercised 
a 
helpful 
and 
stimulative 
influence. 
New 
problems 
have 
of 
course 
arisen 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
investigation 
which 
still 
await 
solution, 
and 
much 
work 
remains 
to 
be 
done. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
we 
see 
how 
fruitful 
the 
renewed 
co-operation 
of 
the 
various 
special 
departments 
of 
science 
may 
become 
after 
a 
period 
of 
isolation 
and 
invigorating 
labor 
apart. 


I 
may 
be 
permitted, 
therefore, 
to 
consider 
the 
relation 
between 
hearing 
and 
orientation 
from 
another 
and 
more 
general 
point 
of 
view. 
What 
we 
call 
the 
auditive 
organ 
is 
in 
the 
lower 
animals 
simply 
a 
sac 
containing 
auditive 
stones. 
As 
we 
ascend 
the 
scale, 
1, 
2, 
3 
semi-circular 
canals 
gradually 
develop 
from 
them, 
whilst 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
otolith 
organ 
itself 
becomes 
more 
complicated. 
Finally, 
in 
the 
higher 
vertebrates, 
and 
particularly 
in 
the 
mammals, 
a 
part 
of 
the 
latter 
organ 
(the 
lagena) 
becomes 
the 
cochlea, 
which 
Helmholtz 
explained 
as 
the 
organ 
for 
sensations 
of 
tone. 
In 
the 
belief 
that 
the 
entire 
labyrinth 
was 
an 
auditive 
organ, 
Helmholtz, 
contrary 
to 
the 
results 
of 
his 
own 
masterly 
analysis, 
originally 
sought 
to 
interpret 
another 
part 
of 
the 
labyrinth 
as 
the 
organ 
of 
noises. 
I 
showed 
a 
long 
time 
ago 
(1873) 
that 
every 
tonal 
stimulus 
by 
shortening 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
excitation 
to 
a 
few 
vibrations, 



gradually 
loses 
its 
character 
of 
pitch 
and 
takes 
on 
that 
of 
a 
sharp, 
dry 
report 
or 
noise. 
[106] 
All 
the 
intervening 
stages 
between 
tones 
and 
noises 
can 
be 
exhibited. 
Such 
being 
the 
case, 
it 
will 
hardly 
be 
assumed 
that 
one 
organ 
is 
suddenly 
and 
at 
some 
given 
point 
replaced 
in 
function 
by 
another. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
different 
experiments 
and 
reasonings 
S. 
Exner 
also 
regards 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
special 
organ 
for 
the 
sensing 
of 
noises 
as 
unnecessary. 


If 
we 
will 
but 
reflect 
how 
small 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
labyrinth 
of 
higher 
animals 
is 
apparently 
in 
the 
service 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
hearing, 
and 
how 
large, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
portion 
is 
which 
very 
likely 
serves 
the 
purposes 
of 
orientation, 
how 
much 
the 
first 
anatomical 
beginnings 
of 
the 
auditive 
sac 
of 
lower 
animals 
resemble 
that 
part 
of 
the 
fully 
developed 
labyrinth 
which 
does 
not 
hear, 
the 
view 
is 
irresistibly 
suggested 
which 
Breuer 
and 
I 
(1874, 
1875) 
expressed, 
that 
the 
auditive 
organ 
took 
its 
development 
from 
an 
organ 
for 
sensing 
movements 
by 
adaptation 
to 
weak 
periodic 
motional 
stimuli, 
and 
that 
many 
apparatuses 
in 
the 
lower 
animals 
which 
are 
held 
to 
be 
organs 
of 
hearing 
are 
not 
auditive 
organs 
at 
all. 
[107] 


This 
view 
appears 
to 
be 
perceptibly 
gaining 
ground. 
Dr. 
Kreidl 
by 
skilfully-
planned 
experiments 
has 
arrived 
at 
the 
conclusion 
that 
even 
fishes 
do 
not 
hear, 
whereas 
E. 
H. 
Weber, 
in 
his 
day, 
regarded 
the 
ossicles 
which 
unite 
the 
air-bladder 
of 
fishes 
with 
the 
labyrinth 
as 
organs 
expressly 
designed 
for 


[108] 


conducting 
sound 
from 
the 
former 
to 
the 
latter. 
Störensen 
has 
investigated 
the 
excitation 
of 
sounds 
by 
the 
air-bladder 
of 
fishes, 
as 
also 
the 
conduction 
of 
shocks 
through 
Weber's 
ossicles. 
He 
regards 
the 
air-bladder 
as 
particularly 
adapted 
for 
receiving 
the 
noises 
made 
by 
other 
fishes 
and 
conducting 
them 
to 
the 
labyrinth. 
He 
has 
heard 
the 
loud 
grunting 
tones 
of 
the 
fishes 
in 
South 
American 
rivers, 
and 
is 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
they 
allure 
and 
find 
each 
other 
in 
this 
manner. 
According 
to 
these 
views 
certain 
fishes 
are 
neither 
deaf 
nor 
dumb. 
[109] 
The 
question 
here 
involved 
might 
be 
solved 
perhaps 
by 
sharply 
distinguishing 
between 
the 
sensation 
of 
hearing 
proper, 
and 
the 
perception 
of 
shocks. 
The 
first-mentioned 
sensation 
may, 
even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
many 
vertebrates, 
be 
extremely 
restricted, 
or 
perhaps 
even 
absolutely 
wanting. 
But 
besides 
the 
auditive 
function, 
Weber's 
ossicles 
may 
perfectly 
well 
discharge 
some 
other 
function. 
Although, 
as 
Moreau 
has 
shown, 
the 
air-
bladder 
itself 
is 
not 
an 
organ 
of 
equilibrium 
in 
the 
simple 
physical 
sense 
of 
Borelli, 
yet 
doubtless 
some 
function 
of 
this 
character 
is 
still 
reserved 
for 
it. 



The 
union 
with 
the 
labyrinth 
favors 
this 
conception, 
and 
so 
a 
host 
of 
new 
problems 
rises 
here 
before 
us. 


I 
should 
like 
to 
close 
with 
a 
reminiscence 
from 
the 
year 
1863. 
Helmholtz's 
Sensations 
of 
Tone 
had 
just 
been 
published 
and 
the 
function 
of 
the 
cochlea 
now 
appeared 
clear 
to 
the 
whole 
world. 
In 
a 
private 
conversation 
which 
I 
had 
with 
a 
physician, 
the 
latter 
declared 
it 
to 
be 
an 
almost 
hopeless 
undertaking 
to 
seek 
to 
fathom 
the 
function 
of 
the 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
labyrinth, 
whereas 
I 
in 
youthful 
boldness 
maintained 
that 
the 
question 
could 
hardly 
fail 
to 
be 
solved, 
and 
that 
very 
soon, 
although 
of 
course 
I 
had 
then 
no 
glimmering 
of 
how 
it 
was 
to 
be 
done. 
Ten 
years 
later 
the 
question 
was 
substantially 
solved. 


To-day, 
after 
having 
tried 
my 
powers 
frequently 
and 
in 
vain 
on 
many 
questions, 
I 
no 
longer 
believe 
that 
we 
can 
make 
short 
work 
of 
the 
problems 
of 
science. 
Nevertheless, 
I 
should 
not 
consider 
an 
"ignorabimus" 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
modesty, 
but 
rather 
as 
the 
opposite. 
That 
expression 
is 
a 
suitable 
one 
only 
with 
regard 
to 
problems 
which 
are 
wrongly 
formulated 
and 
which 
are 
therefore 
not 
problems 
at 
all. 
Every 
real 
problem 
can 
and 
will 
be 
solved 
in 
due 
course 
of 
time 
without 
supernatural 
divination, 
entirely 
by 
accurate 
observation 
and 
close, 
searching 
thought. 



ON 
SOME 
PHENOMENA 
ATTENDING 
THE 
FLIGHT 
OF 
PROJECTILES.

Night's

To 
shoot, 
in 
the 
shortest 
time 
possible, 
as 
many 
holes 
as 
possible 
in 
one 
another's 
bodies, 
and 
not 
always 
for 
exactly 
pardonable 
objects 
and 
ideals, 
seems 
to 
have 
risen 
to 
the 
dignity 
of 
a 
duty 
with 
modern 
men, 
who, 
by 
a 
singular 
inconsistency, 
and 
in 
subservience 
to 
a 
diametrically 
contrary 
ideal, 
are 
bound 
by 
the 
equally 
holy 
obligation 
of 
making 
these 
holes 
as 
small 
as 
possible, 
and, 
when 
made, 
of 
stopping 
them 
up 
and 
of 
healing 
them 
as 
speedily 
as 
possible. 
Since, 
then, 
shooting 
and 
all 
that 
appertains 
thereto, 
is 
a 
very 
important, 
if 
not 
the 
most 
important, 
affair 
of 
modern 
life, 
you 
will 
doubtless 
not 
be 
averse 
to 
giving 
your 
attention 
for 
an 
hour 
to 
some 
experiments 
which 
have 
been 
undertaken, 
not 
for 
advancing 
the 
ends 
of 
war, 
but 
for 
promoting 
the 
ends 
of 
science, 
and 
which 
throw 
some 
light 
on 
the 
phenomena 
attending 
the 
flight 
of 
projectiles. 


Modern 
science 
strives 
to 
construct 
its 
picture 
of 
the 
world 
not 
from 
speculations 
but 
so 
far 
as 
possible 
from 
facts. 
It 
verifies 
its 
constructs 
by 
recourse 
to 
observation. 
Every 
newly 
observed 
fact 
completes 
its 
world-
picture, 
and 
every 
divergence 
of 
a 
construct 
from 
observation 
points 
to 
some 
imperfection, 
to 
some 
lacuna 
in 
it. 
What 
is 
seen 
is 
put 
to 
the 
test 
of, 
and 
supplemented 
by, 
what 
is 
thought, 
which 
is 
again 
naught 
but 
the 
result 
of 
things 
previously 
seen. 
It 
is 
always 
peculiarly 
fascinating, 
therefore, 
to 
subject 
to 
direct 
verification 
by 
observation, 
that 
is, 
to 
render 
palpable 
to 
the 
senses, 
something 
which 
we 
have 
only 
theoretically 
excogitated 
or 
theoretically 
surmised. 


In 
1881, 
on 
hearing 
in 
Paris 
the 
lecture 
of 
the 
Belgian 
artillerist 
Melsens, 
who 
hazarded 
the 
conjecture 
that 
projectiles 
travelling 
at 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
speed 
carry 
masses 
of 
compressed 
air 
before 
them 
which 
are 
instrumental 
in 
producing 
in 



bodies 
struck 
by 
the 
projectiles 
certain 
well-known 
facts 
of 
the 
nature 
of 
explosions, 
the 
desire 
arose 
in 
me 
of 
experimentally 
testing 
his 
conjecture 
and 
of 
rendering 
the 
phenomenon, 
if 
it 
really 
existed, 
perceptible. 
The 
desire 
was 
the 
stronger 
as 
I 
could 
say 
that 
all 
the 
means 
for 
realising 
it 
existed, 
and 
that 
I 
had 
in 
part 
already 
used 
and 
tested 
them 
for 
other 
purposes. 


And 
first 
let 
us 
get 
clear 
regarding 
the 
difficulties 
which 
have 
to 
be 
surmounted. 
Our 
task 
is 
that 
of 
observing 
a 
bullet 
or 
other 
projectile 
which 
is 
rushing 
through 
space 
at 
a 
velocity 
of 
many 
hundred 
yards 
a 
second, 
together 
with 
the 
disturbances 
which 
the 
bullet 
causes 
in 
the 
surrounding 
atmosphere. 
Even 
the 
opaque 
solid 
body 
itself, 
the 
projectile, 
is 
only 
exceptionally 
visible 
under 
such 
circumstances—only 
when 
it 
is 
of 
considerable 
size 
and 
when 
we 
see 
its 
line 
of 
flight 
in 
strong 
perspective 
abridgement 
so 
that 
the 
velocity 
is 
apparently 
diminished. 
We 
see 
a 
large 
projectile 
quite 
clearly 
when 
we 
stand 
behind 
the 
cannon 
and 
look 
steadily 
along 
its 
line 
of 
flight 
or 
in 
the 
less 
pleasant 
case 
when 
the 
projectile 
is 
speeding 
towards 
us. 
There 
is, 
however, 
a 
very 
simple 
and 
effective 
method 
of 
observing 
swiftly 
moving 
bodies 
with 
as 
little 
trouble 
as 
if 
they 
were 
held 
at 
rest 
at 
some 
point 
in 
their 
path. 
The 
method 
is 
that 
of 
illumination 
by 
a 
brilliant 
electric 
spark 
of 
extremely 
short 
duration 
in 
a 
dark 
room. 
But 
since, 
for 
the 
full 
intellectual 
comprehension 
of 
a 
picture 
presented 
to 
the 
eye, 
a 
certain, 
not 
inconsiderable 
interval 
of 
time 
is 
necessary, 
the 
method 
of 
instantaneous 
photography 
will 
naturally 
also 
be 
employed. 
The 
pictures, 
which 
are 
of 
extremely 
minute 
duration, 
are 
thus 
permanently 
recorded 
and 
can 
be 
examined 
and 
analysed 
at 
one's 
convenience 
and 
leisure. 


With 
the 
difficulty 
just 
mentioned 
is 
associated 
still 
another 
and 
greater 
difficulty 
which 
is 
due 
to 
the 
air. 
The 
atmosphere 
in 
its 
usual 
condition 
is 
generally 
not 
visible 
even 
when 
at 
rest. 
But 
the 
task 
presented 
to 
us 
is 
to 
render 
visible 
masses 
of 
air 
which 
in 
addition 
are 
moving 
with 
a 
high 
velocity. 


To 
be 
visible, 
a 
body 
must 
either 
emit 
light 
itself, 
must 
shine, 
or 
must 
affect 
in 
some 
way 
the 
light 
which 
falls 
upon 
it, 
must 
take 
up 
that 
light 
entirely 
or 
partly, 
absorb 
it, 
or 
must 
have 
a 
deflective 
effect 
upon 
it, 
that 
is, 
reflect 
or 
refract 
it. 
We 
cannot 
see 
the 
air 
as 
we 
can 
a 
flame, 
for 
it 
shines 
only 
exceptionally, 
as 
in 
a 
Geissler's 
tube. 
The 
atmosphere 
is 
extremely 



transparent 
and 
colorless; 
it 
cannot 
be 
seen, 
therefore, 
as 
a 
dark 
or 
colored 
body 
can, 
or 
as 
chlorine 
gas 
can, 
or 
vapor 
of 
bromine 
or 
iodine. 
Air, 
finally, 
has 
so 
small 
an 
index 
of 
refraction 
and 
so 
small 
a 
deflective 
influence 
upon 
light, 
that 
the 
refractive 
effect 
is 
commonly 
imperceptible 
altogether. 


A 
glass 
rod 
is 
visible 
in 
air 
or 
in 
water, 
but 
it 
is 
almost 
invisible 
in 
a 
mixture 
of 
benzol 
and 
bisulphuret 
of 
carbon, 
which 
has 
the 
same 
mean 
index 
of 
refraction 
as 
the 
glass. 
Powdered 
glass 
in 
the 
same 
mixture 
has 
a 
vivid 
coloring, 
because 
owing 
to 
the 
decomposition 
of 
the 
colors 
the 
indices 
are 
the 
same 
for 
only 
one 
color 
which 
traverses 
the 
mixture 
unimpeded, 
whilst 
the 
other 
colors 
undergo 
repeated 
reflexions. 
[111] 


Water 
is 
invisible 
in 
water, 
alcohol 
in 
alcohol. 
But 
if 
alcohol 
be 
mixed 
with 
water 
the 
flocculent 
streaks 
of 
the 
alcohol 
in 
the 
water 
will 
be 
seen 
at 
once 
and 
vice 
versa. 
And 
in 
like 
manner 
the 
air, 
too, 
under 
favorable 
circumstances, 
may 
be 
seen. 
Over 
a 
roof 
heated 
by 
the 
burning 
sun, 
a 
tremulous 
wavering 
of 
objects 
is 
noticeable, 
as 
there 
is 
also 
over 
red-hot 
stoves, 
radiators, 
and 
registers. 
In 
all 
these 
cases 
tiny 
flocculent 
masses 
of 
hot 
and 
cold 
air, 
of 
slightly 
differing 
refrangibility, 
are 
mingled 
together. 


In 
like 
manner 
the 
more 
highly 
refracting 
parts 
of 
non-homogeneous 
masses 
of 
glass, 
the 
so-called 
striæ 
or 
imperfections 
of 
the 
glass, 
are 
readily 
detectible 
among 
the 
less 
refracting 
parts 
which 
constitute 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
same. 
Such 
glasses 
are 
unserviceable 
for 
optical 
purposes, 
and 
special 
attention 
has 
been 
devoted 
to 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
methods 
for 
eliminating 
or 
avoiding 
these 
defects. 
The 
result 
has 
been 
the 
development 
of 
an 
extremely 
delicate 
method 
for 
detecting 
optical 
faults—the 
so-called 
method 
of 
Foucault 
and 
Toepler—which 
is 
suitable 
also 
for 
our 
present 
purpose. 


Even 
Huygens 
when 
trying 
to 
detect 
the 
presence 
of 
striæ 
in 
polished 
glasses 
viewed 
them 
under 
oblique 
illumination, 
usually 
at 
a 
considerable 
distance, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
full 
scope 
to 
the 
aberrations, 
and 
had 
recourse 
for 
greater 
exactitude 
to 
a 
telescope. 
But 
the 
method 
was 
carried 
to 
its 
highest 
pitch 
of 
perfection 
in 
1867 
by 
Toepler 
who 
employed 
the 
following 
procedure: 
A 
small 
luminous 
source 
a 
(Fig. 
49) 
illuminates 
a 
lens 
L 
which 
throws 
an 
image 
b 
of 
the 
luminous 
source. 
If 
the 
eye 
be 
so 
placed 
that 
the 
image 
falls 
on 
the 
pupil, 
the 
entire 
lens, 
if 
perfect, 
will 
appear 
equally 
illuminated, 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
all 
points 
of 
it 
send 
out 
rays 
to 
the 
eye. 
Coarse 
imperfections 
of 



form 
or 
of 
homogeneity 
are 
rendered 
visible 
only 
in 
case 
the 
aberrations 
are 
so 
large 
that 
the 
light 
from 
many 
spots 
passes 
by 
the 
pupil 
of 
the 
eye. 
But 
if 
the 
image 
b 
be 
partly 
intercepted 
by 
the 
edge 
of 
a 
small 
slide, 
then 
those 
spots 
in 
the 
lens 
as 
thus 
partly 
darkened 
will 
appear 
brighter 
whose 
light 
by 
its 
greater 
aberrations 
still 
reaches 
the 
eye 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
intercepting 
slide, 
while 
those 
spots 
will 
appear 
darker 
which 
in 
consequence 
of 
aberration 
in 
the 
other 
direction 
throw 
their 
light 
entirely 
upon 
the 
slide. 
This 
artifice 
of 
the 
intercepting 
slide 
which 
had 
previously 
been 
employed 
by 
Foucault 
for 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
optical 
imperfections 
of 
mirrors 
enhances 
enormously 
the 
delicacy 
of 
the 
method, 
which 
is 
still 
further 
augmented 
by 
Toepler's 
employment 
of 
a 
telescope 
behind 
the 
slide. 
Toepler's 
method, 
accordingly, 
enjoys 
all 
the 
advantages 
of 
the 
Huygens 
and 
the 
Foucault 
procedure 
combined. 
It 
is 
so 
delicate 
that 
the 
minutest 
irregularities 
in 
the 
air 
surrounding 
the 
lens 
can 
be 
rendered 
distinctly 
visible, 
as 
I 
shall 
show 
by 
an 
example. 
I 
place 
a 
candle 
before 
the 
lens 
L 
(Fig. 
50) 
and 
so 
arrange 
a 
second 
lens 
M 
that 
the 
flame 
of 
the 
candle 
is 
imaged 
upon 
the 
screen 
S. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
intercepting 
slide 
is 
pushed 
into 
the 
focus, 
b, 
of 
the 
light 
issuing 
from 
a, 
you 
see 
the 
images 
of 
the 
changes 
of 
density 
and 
the 
images 
of 
the 
movements 
induced 
in 
the 
air 
by 
the 
flame 
quite 
distinctly 
upon 
the 
screen. 
The 
distinctness 
of 
the 
phenomenon 
as 
a 
whole 
depends 
upon 
the 
position 
of 
the 
intercepting 
slide 
b. 
The 
removal 
of 
b 
increases 
the 
illumination 
but 
decreases 
the 
distinctness. 
If 
the 
luminous 
source 
a 
be 
removed, 
we 
see 
the 
image 
of 
the 
candle 
flame 
only 
upon 
the 
screen 
S. 
If 
we 
remove 
the 
flame 
and 
allow 
a 
to 
continue 
shining, 
the 
screen 
S 
will 
appear 
uniformly 
illuminated. 


After 
Toepler 
had 
sought 
long 
and 
in 
vain 
to 
render 
the 
irregularities 
produced 
in 
air 
by 
sound-waves 
visible 
by 
this 
principle, 
he 
was 
at 
last 
conducted 
to 
his 
goal 
by 
the 
favorable 
circumstances 
attending 
the 
production 
of 
electric 
sparks. 
The 
waves 
generated 
in 
the 
air 
by 
electric 
sparks 
and 
accompanying 
the 
explosive 
snapping 
of 
the 
same, 
are 
of 
sufficiently 
short 
period 
and 
sufficiently 
powerful 
to 
be 
rendered 
visible 
by 
these 
methods. 
Thus 
we 
see 
how 
by 
a 
careful 
regard 
for 
the 
merest 
and 
most 
shadowy 
indications 
of 
a 
phenomenon 
and 
by 
slight 
progressive 
and 
appropriate 
alterations 
of 
the 
circumstances 
and 
the 
methods, 
ultimately 
the 
most 
astounding 
results 
can 
be 
attained. 
Consider, 
for 
example, 
two 
such 
phenomena 
as 
the 
rubbing 
of 
amber 
and 
the 
electric 
lighting 
of 
modern 
streets. 
A 
person 
ignorant 
of 
the 
myriad 
minute 
links 
that 
join 
these 
two 



things 
together, 
will 
be 
absolutely 
nonplussed 
at 
their 
connexion, 
and 
will 
comprehend 
it 
no 
more 
than 
the 
ordinary 
observer 
who 
is 
unacquainted 
with 
embryology, 
anatomy, 
and 
paleontology 
will 
understand 
the 
connexion 
between 
a 
saurian 
and 
a 
bird. 
The 
high 
value 
and 
significance 
of 
the 
cooperation 
of 
inquirers 
through 
centuries, 
where 
each 
has 
but 
to 
take 
up 
the 
thread 
of 
work 
of 
his 
predecessors 
and 
spin 
it 
onwards, 
is 
rendered 
forcibly 
evident 
by 
such 
examples. 
And 
such 
knowledge 
destroys, 
too, 
in 
the 
clearest 
manner 
imaginable 
that 
impression 
of 
the 
marvellous 
which 
the 
spectator 
may 
receive 
from 
science, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
is 
a 
most 
salutary 
admonishment 
to 
the 
worker 
in 
science 
against 
superciliousness. 
I 
have 
also 
to 
add 
the 
sobering 
remark 
that 
all 
our 
art 
would 
be 
in 
vain 
did 
not 
nature 
herself 
afford 
at 
least 
some 
slight 
guiding 
threads 
leading 
from 
a 
hidden 
phenomenon 
into 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
observable. 
And 
so 
it 
need 
not 
surprise 
us 
that 
once 
under 
particularly 
favorable 
circumstances 
an 
extremely 
powerful 
sound-wave 
which 
had 
been 
caused 
by 
the 
explosion 
of 
several 
hundred 
pounds 
of 
dynamite 
threw 
a 
directly 
visible 
shadow 
in 
the 
sunlight, 
as 
Boys 
has 
recently 
told 
us. 
If 
the 
sound-waves 
were 
absolutely 
without 
influence 
upon 
the 
light, 
this 
could 
not 
have 
occurred, 
and 
all 
our 
artifices 
would 
then, 
too, 
be 
in 
vain. 
And 
so, 
similarly, 
the 
phenomenon 
accompanying 
projectiles 
which 
I 
am 
about 
to 
show 
you 
was 
once 
in 
a 
very 
imperfect 
manner 
incidentally 
seen 
by 
a 
French 
artillerist, 
Journée, 
while 
that 
observer 
was 
simply 
following 
the 
line 
of 
flight 
of 
a 
projectile 
with 
a 
telescope, 
just 
as 
also 
the 
undulations 
produced 
by 
candle 
flames 
are 
in 
a 
weak 
degree 
directly 
visible 
and 
in 
the 
bright 
sunlight 
are 
imaged 
in 
shadowy 
waves 
upon 
a 
uniform 
white 
background. 


Instantaneous 
illumination 
by 
the 
electric 
spark, 
the 
method 
of 
rendering 
visible 
small 
optical 
differences 
or 
striæ, 
which 
may 
hence 
be 
called 
the 
striate, 
or 
differential, 
method, 
[112] 
invented 
by 
Foucault 
and 
Toepler, 
and 
finally 
the 
recording 
of 
the 
image 
by 
a 
photographic 
plate,—these 
therefore 
are 
the 
chief 
means 
which 
are 
to 
lead 
us 
to 
our 
goal. 


I 
instituted 
my 
first 
experiments 
in 
the 
summer 
of 
1884 
with 
a 
target-pistol, 
shooting 
the 
bullet 
through 
a 
striate 
field 
as 
described 
above, 
and 
taking 
care 
that 
the 
projectile 
whilst 
in 
the 
field 
should 
disengage 
an 
illuminating 
electric 
spark 
from 
a 
Leyden 
jar 
or 
Franklin's 
pane, 
which 
spark 
produced 
a 
photographic 
impression 
of 
the 
projectile 
upon 
a 
plate, 
especially 
arranged 



for 
the 
purpose. 
I 
obtained 
the 
image 
of 
the 
projectile 
at 
once 
and 
without 
difficulty. 
I 
also 
readily 
obtained, 
with 
the 
still 
rather 
defective 
dry 
plate 
which 
I 
was 
using, 
exceedingly 
delicate 
images 
of 
the 
sound-waves 
(sparkwaves). 
But 
no 
atmospheric 
condensation 
produced 
by 
the 
projectile 
was 
visible. 
I 
now 
determined 
the 
velocity 
of 
my 
projectile 
and 
found 
it 
to 
be 
only 
240 
metres 
per 
second, 
or 
considerably 
less 
than 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound 
(which 
is 
340 
metres 
per 
second). 
I 
saw 
immediately 
that 
under 
such 
circumstances 
no 
noticeable 
compression 
of 
the 
air 
could 
be 
produced, 
for 
any 
atmospheric 
compression 
must 
of 
necessity 
travel 
forward 
at 
the 
same 
speed 
with 
sound 
(340 
metres 
per 
second) 
and 
consequently 
would 
be 
always 
ahead 
of 
and 
speeding 
away 
from 
the 
projectile. 


I 
was 
so 
thoroughly 
convinced, 
however, 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
the 
supposed 
phenomenon 
at 
a 
velocity 
exceeding 
340 
metres 
per 
second, 
that 
I 
requested 
Professor 
Salcher, 
of 
Fiume, 
an 
Austrian 
port 
on 
the 
Gulf 
of 
Quarnero, 
to 
undertake 
the 
experiment 
with 
projectiles 
travelling 
at 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
speed. 
In 
the 
summer 
of 
1886 
Salcher 
in 
conjunction 
with 
Professor 
Riegler 
conducted 
in 
a 
spacious 
and 
suitable 
apartment 
placed 
at 
their 
disposal 
by 
the 
Directors 
of 
the 
Royal 
Imperial 
Naval 
Academy, 
experiments 
of 
the 
kind 
indicated 
and 
conforming 
in 
method 
exactly 
to 
those 
which 
I 
had 
instituted, 
with 
the 
precise 
results 
expected. 
The 
phenomenon, 
in 
fact, 
accorded 
perfectly 
with 
the 
a 
priori 
sketch 
of 
it 
which 
I 
had 
drafted 
previously 
to 
the 
experiment. 
As 
the 
experimenting 
was 
continued, 
new 
and 
unforeseen 
features 
made 
their 
appearance. 


It 
would 
be 
unfair, 
of 
course, 
to 
expect 
from 
the 
very 
first 
experiments 
faultless 
and 
highly 
distinct 
photographs. 
It 
was 
sufficient 
that 
success 
was 
secured 
and 
that 
I 
had 
convinced 
myself 
that 
further 
labor 
and 
expenditure 
would 
not 
be 
vain. 
And 
on 
this 
score 
I 
am 
greatly 
indebted 
to 
the 
two 
gentlemen 
above 
mentioned. 


The 
Austrian 
Naval 
Department 
subsequently 
placed 
a 
cannon 
at 
Salcher's 
disposal 
in 
Pola, 
an 
Adriatic 
seaport, 
and 
I 
myself, 
together 
with 
my 
son, 
then 
a 
student 
of 
medicine, 
having 
received 
and 
accepted 
a 
courteous 
invitation 
from 
Krupp, 
repaired 
to 
Meppen, 
a 
town 
in 
Hanover, 
where 
we 
conducted 
with 
only 
the 
necessary 
apparatus 
several 
experiments 
on 
the 
open 
artillery 
range. 
All 
these 
experiments 
furnished 
tolerably 
good 
and 
complete 
pictures. 



Some 
little 
progress, 
too, 
was 
made. 
The 
outcome 
of 
our 
experience 
on 
both 
artillery 
ranges, 
however, 
was 
the 
settled 
conviction 
that 
really 
good 
results 
could 
be 
obtained 
only 
by 
the 
most 
careful 
conduct 
of 
the 
experiments 
in 
a 
laboratory 
especially 
adapted 
to 
the 
purpose. 
The 
expensiveness 
of 
the 
experiments 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
was 
not 
the 
determining 
consideration 
here, 
for 
the 
size 
of 
the 
projectile 
is 
indifferent. 
Given 
the 
same 
velocity 
and 
the 
results 
are 
quite 
similar, 
whether 
the 
projectiles 
are 
large 
or 
small. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
in 
a 
laboratory 
the 
experimenter 
has 
perfect 
control 
over 
the 
initial 
velocity, 
which, 
provided 
the 
proper 
equipment 
is 
at 
hand, 
can 
be 
altered 
at 
will 
simply 
by 
altering 
the 
charge 
and 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
projectile. 
The 
requisite 
experiments 
were 
accordingly 
conducted 
by 
me 
in 
my 
laboratory 
at 
Prague, 
partly 
in 
conjunction 
with 
my 
son 
and 
partly 
afterwards 
by 
him 
alone. 
The 
latter 
are 
the 
most 
perfect 
and 
I 
shall 
accordingly 
speak 
in 
detail 
here 
of 
these 
only. 


Picture 
to 
yourself 
an 
apparatus 
for 
detecting 
optical 
striæ 
set 
up 
in 
a 
dark 
room. 
In 
order 
not 
to 
make 
the 
description 
too 
complicated, 
I 
shall 
give 
the 
essential 
features 
only 
of 
the 
apparatus, 
leaving 
out 
of 
account 
altogether 
the 
minuter 
details 
which 
are 
rather 
of 
consequence 
for 
the 
technical 
performance 
of 
the 
experiment 
than 
for 
its 
understanding. 
We 
suppose 
the 
projectile 
speeding 
on 
its 
path, 
accordingly, 
through 
the 
field 
of 
our 
differential 
optical 
apparatus. 
On 
reaching 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
field 
(Fig. 
51) 
the 
projectile 
disengages 
an 
illuminating 
electric 
spark 
a, 
and 
the 
image 
of 
the 
projectile, 
so 
produced, 
is 
photographically 
impressed 
upon 
the 
plate 
of 
the 
camera 
behind 
the 
intercepting 
slide 
b. 
In 
the 
last 
and 
best 
experiments 
the 
lens 
L 
was 
replaced 
by 
a 
spherical 
silvered-glass 
mirror 
made 
by 
K. 
Fritsch 
(formerly 
Prokesch) 
of 
Vienna, 
whereby 
the 
apparatus 
was 
naturally 
more 
complicated 
than 
it 
appears 
in 
our 
diagram. 
The 
projectile 
having 
been 
carefully 
aimed 
passes 
in 
crossing 
the 
differential 
field 
between 
two 
vertical 
isolated 
wires 
which 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
two 
coatings 
of 
a 
Leyden 
jar, 
and 
completely 
filling 
the 
space 
between 
the 
wires 
discharges 
the 
jar. 
In 
the 
axis 
of 
the 
differential 
apparatus 
the 
circuit 
has 
a 
second 
gap 
a 
which 
furnishes 
the 
illuminating 
spark, 
the 
image 
of 
which 
falls 
on 
the 
intercepting 
slide 
b. 
The 
wires 
in 
the 
differential 
field 
having 
occasioned 
manifold 
disturbances 
were 
subsequently 
done 
away 
with. 
In 
the 
new 
arrangement 
the 
projectile 
passes 
through 
a 
ring 
(see 
dotted 
line, 
Fig. 
51), 
to 
the 
air 
in 
which 
it 
imparts 
a 
sharp 
impulse 
which 
travels 
forward 
in 
the 
tube 
r 
as 
a 
sound-wave 
having 
the 



approximate 
velocity 
of 
340 
metres 
per 
second, 
topples 
over 
through 
the 
aperture 
of 
an 
electric 
screen 
the 
flame 
of 
a 
candle 
situated 
at 
the 
other 
opening 
of 
the 
tube, 
and 
so 
discharges 
the 
jar. 
The 
length 
of 
the 
tube 
r 
is 
so 
adjusted 
that 
the 
discharge 
occurs 
the 
moment 
the 
projectile 
enters 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
now 
fully 
clear 
and 
free 
field 
of 
vision. 
We 
will 
also 
leave 
out 
of 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
to 
secure 
fully 
the 
success 
of 
the 
experiment, 
a 
large 
jar 
is 
first 
discharged 
by 
the 
flame, 
and 
that 
by 
the 
agency 
of 
this 
first 
discharge 
the 
discharge 
of 
a 
second 
small 
jar 
having 
a 
spark 
of 
very 
short 
period 
which 
furnishes 
the 
spark 
really 
illuminating 
the 
projectile 
is 
effected. 
Sparks 
from 
large 
jars 
have 
an 
appreciable 
duration, 
and 
owing 
to 
the 
great 
velocity 
of 
the 
projectiles 
furnish 
blurred 
photographs 
only. 
By 
carefully 
husbanding 
the 
light 
of 
the 
differential 
apparatus, 
and 
owing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
much 
more 
light 
reaches 
the 
photographic 
plate 
in 
this 
way 
than 
would 
otherwise 
reach 
it, 
we 
can 
obtain 
beautiful, 
strong, 
and 
sharp 
photographs 
with 
incredibly 
small 
sparks. 
The 
contours 
of 
the 
pictures 
appear 
as 
very 
delicate 
and 
very 
sharp, 
closely 
adjacent 
double 
lines. 
From 
their 
distance 
from 
one 
another, 
and 
from 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
projectile, 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
illumination, 
or 
of 
the 
spark, 
is 
found 
to 
be 
1/800000 
of 
a 
second. 
It 
is 
evident, 
therefore, 
that 
experiments 
with 
mechanical 
snap 
slides 
can 
furnish 
no 
results 
worthy 
of 
the 
name. 


Let 
us 
consider 
now 
first 
the 
picture 
of 
a 
projectile 
in 
the 
rough, 
as 
represented 
in 
Figure 
52, 
and 
then 
let 
us 
examine 
it 
in 
its 
photographic 
form 
as 
seen 
in 
Figure 
53. 
The 
latter 
picture 
is 
of 
a 
shot 
from 
an 
Austrian 
Mannlicher 
rifle. 
If 
I 
were 
not 
to 
tell 
you 
what 
the 
picture 
represented 
you 
would 
very 
likely 
imagine 
it 
to 
be 
a 
bird's 
eye 
view 
of 
a 
boat 
b 
moving 
swiftly 
through 
the 
water. 
In 
front 
you 
see 
the 
bow-wave 
and 
behind 
the 
body 
a 
phenomenon 
k 
which 
closely 
resembles 
the 
eddies 
formed 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
a 
ship. 
And 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
fact 
the 
dark 
hyperboloid 
arc 
which 
streams 
from 
the 
tip 
of 
the 
projectile 
really 
is 
a 
compressed 
wave 
of 
air 
exactly 
analogous 
to 
the 
bow-wave 
produced 
by 
a 
ship 
moving 
through 
the 
water, 
with 
the 
exception 
that 
the 
wave 
of 
air 
is 
not 
a 
surface-wave. 
The 
air-wave 
is 
produced 
in 
atmospheric 
space 
and 
encompasses 
the 
projectile 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
shell 
on 
all 
sides. 
The 
wave 
is 
visible 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
that 
the 
heated 
shell 
of 
air 
surrounding 
the 
candle 
flame 
of 
our 
former 
experiments 
is 
visible. 
And 
the 
cylinder 
of 
friction-heated 
air 
which 
the 
projectile 
throws 
off 
in 
the 
form 
of 
vortex 
rings 
really 
does 
answer 
to 
the 
water 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
a 
vessel. 



Now 
just 
as 
a 
slowly 
moving 
boat 
produces 
no 
bow-wave, 
but 
the 
bow-wave 
is 
seen 
only 
when 
the 
boat 
moves 
with 
a 
speed 
which 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
velocity 
of 
propagation 
of 
surface-waves 
in 
water, 
so, 
in 
like 
manner, 
no 
wave 
of 
compression 
is 
visible 
in 
front 
of 
a 
projectile 
so 
long 
as 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
projectile 
is 
less 
than 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound. 
But 
if 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
projectile 
reaches 
and 
exceeds 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound, 
then 
the 
head-wave, 
as 
we 
shall 
call 
it, 
augments 
noticeably 
in 
power, 
and 
is 
more 
and 
more 
extended, 
that 
is, 
the 
angle 
made 
by 
the 
contours 
of 
the 
wave 
with 
the 
direction 
of 
flight 
is 
more 
and 
more 
diminished, 
just 
as 
when 
the 
speed 
of 
a 
boat 
is 
increased 
a 
similar 
phenomenon 
is 
noticed 
in 
connexion 
with 
the 
bow-
wave. 
In 
fact, 
we 
can 
from 
an 
instantaneous 
photograph 
so 
taken 
approximately 
estimate 
the 
speed 
with 
which 
the 
projectile 
is 
travelling. 


The 
explanation 
of 
the 
bow-wave 
of 
a 
ship 
and 
that 
of 
the 
head-wave 
of 
a 
body 
travelling 
in 
atmospheric 
space 
both 
repose 
upon 
the 
same 
principle, 
long 
ago 
employed 
by 
Huygens. 
Conceive 
a 
number 
of 
pebbles 
to 
be 
cast 
into 
a 
pond 
of 
water 
at 
regular 
intervals 
in 
such 
wise 
that 
all 
the 
spots 
struck 
are 
situate 
in 
the 
same 
straight 
line, 
and 
that 
every 
spot 
subsequently 
struck 
lies 
a 
short 
space 
farther 
to 
the 
right. 
The 
spots 
first 
struck 
will 
furnish 
then 
the 
wave-circles 
which 
are 
widest, 
and 
all 
of 
them 
together 
will, 
at 
the 
points 
where 
they 
are 
thickest, 
form 
a 
sort 
of 
cornucopia 
closely 
resembling 
the 
bow-wave. 
(Fig. 
54.) 
The 
resemblance 
is 
greater 
the 
smaller 
the 
pebbles 
are, 
and 
the 
more 
quickly 
they 
succeed 
each 
other. 
If 
a 
rod 
be 
dipped 
into 
the 
water 
and 
quickly 
carried 
along 
its 
surface, 
the 
falling 
of 
the 
pebbles 
will 
then 
take 
place, 
so 
to 
speak, 
uninterruptedly, 
and 
we 
shall 
have 
a 
real 
bow-wave. 
If 
we 
put 
the 
compressed 
air-wave 
in 
the 
place 
of 
the 
surface-waves 
of 
the 
water, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
head-wave 
of 
the 
projectile. 


You 
may 
be 
disposed 
to 
say 
now, 
it 
is 
all 
very 
pretty 
and 
interesting 
to 
observe 
a 
projectile 
in 
its 
flight, 
but 
of 
what 
practical 
use 
is 
it? 


It 
is 
true, 
I 
reply, 
one 
cannot 
wage 
war 
with 
photographed 
projectiles. 
And 
I 
have 
likewise 
often 
had 
to 
say 
to 
medical 
students 
attending 
my 
lectures 
on 
physics, 
when 
they 
inquired 
for 
the 
practical 
value 
of 
some 
physical 
observation, 
"You 
cannot, 
gentlemen, 
cure 
diseases 
with 
it." 
I 
had 
also 
once 
to 
give 
my 
opinion 
regarding 
how 
much 
physics 
should 
be 
taught 
at 
a 
school 
for 
millers, 
supposing 
the 
instruction 
there 
to 
be 
confined 
exactly 
to 
what 
was 



necessary 
for 
a 
miller. 
I 
was 
obliged 
to 
reply: 
"A 
miller 
always 
needs 
exactly 
as 
much 
physics 
as 
he 
knows." 
Knowledge 
which 
one 
does 
not 
possess 
one 
cannot 
use. 


Let 
us 
forego 
entirely 
the 
consideration 
that 
as 
a 
general 
thing 
every 
scientific 
advance, 
every 
new 
problem 
elucidated, 
every 
extension 
or 
enrichment 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
facts, 
affords 
a 
better 
foundation 
for 
practical 
pursuits. 
Let 
us 
rather 
put 
the 
special 
question, 
Is 
it 
not 
possible 
to 
derive 
some 
really 
practical 
knowledge 
from 
our 
theoretical 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
phenomena 
which 
take 
place 
in 
the 
space 
surrounding 
a 
projectile? 


No 
physicist 
who 
has 
ever 
studied 
waves 
of 
sound 
or 
photographed 
them 
will 
have 
the 
least 
doubt 
regarding 
the 
sound-wave 
character 
of 
the 
atmospheric 
condensation 
encompassing 
the 
head 
of 
a 
flying 
projectile. 
We 
have 
therefore, 
without 
ado, 
called 
this 
condensation 
the 
head-wave. 


Knowing 
this, 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
view 
of 
Melsens 
according 
to 
which 
the 
projectile 
carries 
along 
with 
it 
masses 
of 
air 
which 
it 
forces 
into 
the 
bodies 
struck, 
is 
untenable. 
A 
forward-moving 
sound-wave 
is 
not 
a 
forward-moving 
mass 
of 
matter 
but 
a 
forward-moving 
form 
of 
motion, 
just 
as 
a 
water-wave 
or 
the 
waves 
of 
a 
field 
of 
wheat 
are 
only 
forward-moving 
forms 
of 
motion 
and 
not 
movements 
of 
masses 
of 
water 
or 
masses 
of 
wheat. 


By 
interference-experiments, 
on 
which 
I 
cannot 
touch 
here 
but 
which 
will 
be 
found 
roughly 
represented 
in 
Figure 
55, 
it 
was 
found 
that 
the 
bell-shaped 
head-wave 
in 
question 
is 
an 
extremely 
thin 
shell 
and 
that 
the 
condensations 
of 
the 
same 
are 
quite 
moderate, 
scarcely 
exceeding 
two-tenths 
of 
an 
atmosphere. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
question, 
therefore, 
of 
explosive 
effects 
in 
the 
body 
struck 
by 
the 
projectile 
through 
so 
slight 
a 
degree 
of 
atmospheric 
compression. 
The 
phenomena 
attending 
wounds 
from 
rifle 
balls, 
for 
example, 
are 
not 
to 
be 
explained 
as 
Melsens 
and 
Busch 
explain 
them, 
but 
are 
due, 
as 
Kocher 
and 
Reger 
maintain, 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
projectile 
itself. 


A 
simple 
experiment 
will 
show 
how 
insignificant 
is 
the 
part 
played 
by 
the 
friction 
of 
the 
air, 
or 
the 
supposed 
conveyance 
of 
the 
air 
along 
with 
the 
moving 
projectile. 
If 
the 
photograph 
of 
the 
projectile 
be 
taken 
while 
passing 
through 
a 
flame, 
i. 
e., 
a 
visible 
gas, 
the 
flame 
will 
be 
seen 
to 
be, 
not 
torn 
and 



deformed, 
but 
smoothly 
and 
cleanly 
perforated, 
like 
any 
solid 
body. 
Within 
and 
around 
the 
flame 
the 
contours 
of 
the 
head-wave 
will 
be 
seen. 
The 
flickering, 
the 
extinction 
of 
the 
flame, 
etc., 
take 
place 
only 
after 
the 
projectile 
has 
travelled 
on 
a 
considerable 
distance 
in 
its 
path, 
and 
is 
then 
affected 
by 
the 
powder 
gases 
which 
hurry 
after 
the 
bullet 
or 
by 
the 
air 
preceding 
the 
powder-
gases. 


The 
physicist 
who 
examines 
the 
head-wave 
and 
recognises 
its 
sound-wave 
character 
also 
sees 
that 
the 
wave 
in 
question 
is 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
with 
the 
short 
sharp 
waves 
produced 
by 
electric 
sparks, 
that 
it 
is 
a 
noise-wave. 
Hence, 
whenever 
any 
portion 
of 
the 
head-wave 
strikes 
the 
ear 
it 
will 
be 
heard 
as 
a 
report. 
Appearances 
point 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
the 
projectile 
carries 
this 
report 
along 
with 
it. 
In 
addition 
to 
this 
report, 
which 
advances 
with 
the 
velocity 
of 
the 
projectile 
and 
so 
usually 
travels 
at 
a 
speed 
greater 
than 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound, 
there 
is 
also 
to 
be 
heard 
the 
report 
of 
the 
exploding 
powder 
which 
travels 
forward 
with 
the 
ordinary 
velocity 
of 
sound. 
Hence 
two 
explosions 
will 
be 
heard, 
each 
distinct 
in 
time. 
The 
circumstance 
that 
this 
fact 
was 
long 
misconstrued 
by 
practical 
observers 
but 
when 
actually 
noticed 
frequently 
received 
grotesque 
explanations 
and 
that 
ultimately 
my 
view 
was 
accepted 
as 
the 
correct 
one, 
appears 
to 
me 
in 
itself 
a 
sufficient 
justification 
that 
researches 
such 
as 
we 
are 
here 
speaking 
of 
are 
not 
utterly 
superfluous 
even 
in 
practical 
directions. 
That 
the 
flashes 
and 
sounds 
of 
discharging 
artillery 
are 
used 
for 
estimating 
the 
distances 
of 
batteries 
is 
well 
known, 
and 
it 
stands 
to 
reason 
that 
any 
unclear 
theoretical 
conception 
of 
the 
facts 
here 
involved 
will 
seriously 
affect 
the 
correctness 
of 
practical 
calculations. 


It 
may 
appear 
astonishing 
to 
a 
person 
hearing 
it 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
that 
a 
single 
shot 
has 
a 
double 
report 
due 
to 
two 
different 
velocities 
of 
propagation. 
But 
the 
reflexion 
that 
projectiles 
whose 
velocity 
is 
less 
than 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound 
produce 
no 
head-waves 
(because 
every 
impulse 
imparted 
to 
the 
air 
travels 
forward, 
that 
is, 
ahead, 
with 
exactly 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound), 
throws 
full 
light 
when 
logically 
developed 
upon 
the 
peculiar 
circumstance 
above 
mentioned. 
If 
the 
projectile 
moves 
faster 
than 
sound, 
the 
air 
ahead 
of 
it 
cannot 
recede 
from 
it 
quickly 
enough. 
The 
air 
is 
condensed 
and 
warmed, 
and 
thereupon, 
as 
all 
know, 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound 
is 
augmented 
until 
the 
head-wave 
travels 
forward 
as 
rapidly 
as 
the 
projectile 
itself, 
so 
that 
there 
is 
no 
need 
whatever 
of 
any 
additional 
augmentation 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
propagation. 
If 
such 
a 
wave 



were 
left 
entirely 
to 
itself, 
it 
would 
increase 
in 
length 
and 
soon 
pass 
into 
an 
ordinary 
sound-wave, 
travelling 
with 
less 
velocity. 
But 
the 
projectile 
is 
always 
behind 
it 
and 
so 
maintains 
it 
at 
its 
proper 
density 
and 
velocity. 
Even 
if 
the 
projectile 
penetrates 
a 
piece 
of 
cardboard 
or 
a 
board 
of 
wood, 
which 
catches 
and 
obstructs 
the 
head-wave, 
there 
will, 
as 
Figure 
56 
shows, 
immediately 
appear 
at 
the 
emerging 
apex 
a 
newly 
formed, 
not 
to 
say 
newly 
born, 
head-wave. 
We 
may 
observe 
on 
the 
cardboard 
the 
reflexion 
and 
diffraction 
of 
the 
head-wave, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
a 
flame 
its 
refraction, 
so 
that 
no 
doubt 
as 
to 
its 
nature 
can 
remain. 


Permit 
me, 
now, 
to 
illustrate 
the 
most 
essential 
of 
the 
points 
that 
I 
have 
just 
adduced, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
few 
rough 
drawings 
taken 
from 
older 
and 
less 
perfect 
photographs. 


In 
the 
sketch 
of 
Figure 
57 
you 
see 
the 
projectile, 
which 
has 
just 
left 
the 
barrel 
of 
the 
rifle, 
touch 
a 
wire 
and 
disengage 
the 
illuminating 
spark. 
At 
the 
apex 
of 
the 
projectile 
you 
already 
see 
the 
beginnings 
of 
a 
powerful 
head-wave, 
and 
in 
front 
of 
the 
wave 
a 
transparent 
fungiform 
cluster. 
This 
latter 
is 
the 
air 
which 
has 
been 
forced 
out 
of 
the 
barrel 
by 
the 
projectile. 
Circular 
sound-waves, 
noise-waves, 
which 
are 
soon 
overtaken 
by 
the 
projectile, 
also 
issue 
from 
the 
barrel. 
But 
behind 
the 
projectile 
opaque 
puffs 
of 
powder-gas 
rush 
forth. 
It 
is 
scarcely 
necessary 
to 
add 
that 
many 
other 
questions 
in 
ballistics 
may 
be 
studied 
by 
this 
method, 
as, 
for 
example, 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
gun-carriage. 


A 
distinguished 
French 
artillerist, 
M. 
Gossot, 
has 
applied 
the 
views 
of 
the 
head-wave 
here 
given 
in 
quite 
a 
different 
manner. 
The 
practice 
in 
measuring 
the 
velocity 
of 
projectiles 
is 
to 
cause 
the 
projectile 
to 
pass 
through 
wire 
screens 
placed 
at 
different 
points 
in 
its 
path, 
and 
by 
the 
tearing 
of 
these 
screens 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
electro-magnetic 
time-signals 
on 
falling 
slabs 
or 
rotating 
drums. 
Gossot 
caused 
these 
signals 
to 
be 
made 
directly 
by 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
head-wave, 
did 
away 
thus 
with 
the 
wire 
screens, 
and 
carried 
the 
method 
so 
far 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
measure 
the 
velocities 
of 
projectiles 
travelling 
in 
high 
altitudes, 
where 
the 
use 
of 
wire 
screens 
was 
quite 
out 
of 
the 
question. 


The 
laws 
of 
the 
resistance 
of 
fluids 
and 
of 
air 
to 
bodies 
travelling 
in 
them 
form 
an 
extremely 
complicated 
problem, 
which 
can 
be 
reasoned 
out 
very 
simply 
and 
prettily 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
pure 
philosophy 
but 
practice 
offers 
not 
a 
few 
difficulties. 
The 
same 
body 
having 
the 
velocity 
2, 
3, 
4 
... 
displaces 
in 
the 



same 
interval 
2, 
3, 
4 
... 
times 
the 
same 
mass 
of 
air, 
or 
the 
same 
mass 
of 
fluid, 
and 
imparts 
to 
it 
in 
addition 
2, 
3, 
4 
... 
times 
the 
same 
velocity. 
But 
for 
this, 
plainly, 
4, 
9, 
16 
... 
times 
the 
original 
force 
is 
required. 
Hence, 
the 
resistance, 
it 
is 
said, 
increases 
with 
the 
square 
of 
the 
velocity. 
This 
is 
all 
very 
pretty 
and 
simple 
and 
obvious. 
But 
practice 
and 
theory 
are 
at 
daggers' 
points 
here. 
Practice 
tells 
us 
that 
when 
we 
increase 
the 
velocity, 
the 
law 
of 
the 
resistance 
changes. 
For 
every 
portion 
of 
the 
velocity 
the 
law 
is 
different. 


The 
studies 
of 
the 
talented 
English 
naval 
architect, 
Froude, 
have 
thrown 
light 
upon 
this 
question. 
Froude 
has 
shown 
that 
the 
resistance 
is 
conditioned 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
most 
multifarious 
phenomena. 
A 
ship 
in 
motion 
is 
subjected 
to 
the 
friction 
of 
the 
water. 
It 
causes 
eddies 
and 
it 
generates 
in 
addition 
waves 
which 
radiate 
outward 
from 
it. 
Every 
one 
of 
these 
phenomena 
are 
dependent 
upon 
the 
velocity 
in 
some 
different 
manner, 
and 
it 
is 
consequently 
not 
astonishing 
that 
the 
law 
of 
the 
resistance 
should 
be 
a 
complicated 
one. 


The 
preceding 
observations 
suggest 
quite 
analogous 
reflexions 
for 
projectiles. 
Here 
also 
we 
have 
friction, 
the 
formation 
of 
eddies, 
and 
the 
generation 
of 
waves. 
Here, 
also, 
therefore, 
we 
should 
not 
be 
surprised 
at 
finding 
the 
law 
of 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
air 
a 
complicated 
one, 
nor 
puzzled 
at 
learning 
that 
in 
actuality 
the 
law 
of 
resistance 
changes 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
projectile 
exceeds 
the 
velocity 
of 
sound, 
for 
this 
is 
the 
precise 
point 
at 
which 
one 
important 
element 
of 
the 
resistance, 
namely, 
the 
formation 
of 
waves, 
first 
comes 
into 
play. 


No 
one 
doubts 
that 
a 
pointed 
bullet 
pierces 
the 
air 
with 
less 
resistance 
than 
a 
blunt 
bullet. 
The 
photographs 
themselves 
show 
that 
the 
head-wave 
is 
weaker 
for 
a 
pointed 
projectile. 
It 
is 
not 
impossible, 
similarly, 
that 
forms 
of 
bullets 
will 
be 
invented 
which 
generate 
fewer 
eddies, 
etc., 
and 
that 
we 
shall 
study 
these 
phenomena 
also 
by 
photography. 
I 
am 
of 
opinion 
from 
the 
few 
experiments 
which 
I 
have 
made 
in 
this 
direction 
that 
not 
much 
more 
can 
be 
done 
by 
changing 
the 
form 
of 
the 
projectile 
when 
the 
velocity 
is 
very 
great, 
but 
I 
have 
not 
gone 
into 
the 
question 
thoroughly. 
Researches 
of 
the 
kind 
we 
are 
considering 
can 
certainly 
not 
be 
detrimental 
to 
practical 
artillery, 
and 
it 
is 
no 
less 
certain 
that 
experiments 
by 
artillerists 
on 
a 
large 
scale 
will 
be 
of 
undoubted 
benefit 
to 
physics. 



No 
one 
who 
has 
had 
the 
opportunity 
of 
studying 
modern 
guns 
and 
projectiles 
in 
their 
marvellous 
perfection, 
their 
power 
and 
precision, 
can 
help 
confessing 
that 
a 
high 
technical 
and 
scientific 
achievement 
has 
found 
its 
incarnation 
in 
these 
objects. 
We 
may 
surrender 
ourselves 
so 
completely 
to 
this 
impression 
as 
to 
forget 
for 
a 
moment 
the 
terrible 
purposes 
they 
serve. 


Permit 
me, 
therefore, 
before 
we 
separate, 
to 
say 
a 
few 
words 
on 
this 
glaring 
contrast. 
The 
greatest 
man 
of 
war 
and 
of 
silence 
which 
the 
present 
age 
has 
produced 
once 
asserted 
that 
perpetual 
peace 
is 
a 
dream, 
and 
not 
a 
beautiful 
dream 
at 
that. 
We 
may 
accord 
to 
this 
profound 
student 
of 
mankind 
a 
judgment 
in 
these 
matters 
and 
can 
also 
appreciate 
the 
soldier's 
horror 
of 
stagnation 
from 
all 
too 
lengthy 
peace. 
But 
it 
requires 
a 
strong 
belief 
in 
the 
insuperableness 
of 
mediæval 
barbarism 
to 
hope 
for 
and 
to 
expect 
no 
great 
improvement 
in 
international 
relations. 
Think 
of 
our 
forefathers 
and 
of 
the 
times 
when 
club 
law 
ruled 
supreme, 
when 
within 
the 
same 
country 
and 
the 
same 
state 
brutal 
assaults 
and 
equally 
brutal 
self-defence 
were 
universal 
and 
self-evident. 
This 
state 
of 
affairs 
grew 
so 
oppressive 
that 
finally 
a 
thousand 
and 
one 
circumstances 
compelled 
people 
to 
put 
an 
end 
to 
it, 
and 
the 
cannon 
had 
most 
to 
say 
in 
accomplishing 
the 
work. 
Yet 
the 
rule 
of 
club 
law 
was 
not 
abolished 
so 
quickly 
after 
all. 
It 
had 
simply 
passed 
to 
other 
clubs. 
We 
must 
not 
abandon 
ourselves 
to 
dreams 
of 
the 
Rousseau 
type. 
Questions 
of 
law 
will 
in 
a 
sense 
forever 
remain 
questions 
of 
might. 
Even 
in 
the 
United 
States 
where 
every 
one 
is 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
principle 
entitled 
to 
the 
same 
privileges, 
the 
ballot 
according 
to 
Stallo's 
pertinent 
remark 
is 
but 
a 
milder 
substitute 
for 
the 
club. 
Nor 
need 
I 
tell 
you 
that 
many 
of 
our 
own 
fellow-citizens 
are 
still 
enamored 
of 
the 
old 
original 
methods. 
Very, 
very 
gradually, 
however, 
as 
civilisation 
progresses, 
the 
intercourse 
of 
men 
takes 
on 
gentler 
forms, 
and 
no 
one 
who 
really 
knows 
the 
good 
old 
times 
will 
ever 
honestly 
wish 
them 
back 
again, 
however 
beautifully 
they 
may 
be 
painted 
and 
rhymed 
about. 


In 
the 
intercourse 
of 
the 
nations, 
however, 
the 
old 
club 
law 
still 
reigns 
supreme. 
But 
since 
its 
rule 
is 
taxing 
the 
intellectual, 
the 
moral, 
and 
the 
material 
resources 
of 
the 
nations 
to 
the 
utmost 
and 
constitutes 
scarcely 
less 
a 
burden 
in 
peace 
than 
in 
war, 
scarcely 
less 
a 
yoke 
for 
the 
victor 
than 
for 
the 
vanquished, 
it 
must 
necessarily 
grow 
more 
and 
more 
unendurable. 
Reason, 
fortunately, 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
exclusive 
possession 
of 
those 
who 
modestly 
call 
themselves 
the 
upper 
ten 
thousand. 
Here, 
as 
everywhere, 
the 
evil 
itself 
will 



awaken 
the 
intellectual 
and 
ethical 
forces 
which 
are 
destined 
to 
mitigate 
it. 
Let 
the 
hate 
of 
races 
and 
of 
nationalities 
run 
riot 
as 
it 
may, 
the 
intercourse 
of 
nations 
will 
still 
increase 
and 
grow 
more 
intimate. 
By 
the 
side 
of 
the 
problems 
which 
separate 
nations, 
the 
great 
and 
common 
ideals 
which 
claim 
the 
exclusive 
powers 
of 
the 
men 
of 
the 
future 
appear 
one 
after 
another 
in 
greater 
distinctness 
and 
in 
greater 
might. 



ON 
INSTRUCTION 
IN 
THE 
CLASSICS 
AND 
THE 
SCIENCES. 
[113] 


Perhaps 
the 
most 
fantastic 
proposition 
that 
Maupertuis, 
[114] 
the 
renowned 
president 
of 
the 
Berlin 
Academy, 
ever 
put 
forward 
for 
the 
approval 
of 
his 
contemporaries 
was 
that 
of 
founding 
a 
city 
in 
which, 
to 
instruct 
and 
discipline 
young 
students, 
only 
Latin 
should 
be 
spoken. 
Maupertuis's 
Latin 
city 
remained 
an 
idle 
wish. 
But 
for 
centuries 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
institutions 
exist 
in 
which 
our 
children 
spend 
a 
goodly 
portion 
of 
their 
days, 
and 
whose 
atmosphere 
constantly 
surrounds 
them, 
even 
when 
without 
their 
walls. 


For 
centuries 
instruction 
in 
the 
ancient 
languages 
has 
been 
zealously 
cultivated. 
For 
centuries 
its 
necessity 
has 
been 
alternately 
championed 
and 
contested. 
More 
strongly 
than 
ever 
are 
authoritative 
voices 
now 
raised 
against 
the 
preponderance 
of 
instruction 
in 
the 
classics 
and 
in 
favor 
of 
an 
education 
more 
suited 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
time, 
especially 
for 
a 
more 
generous 
treatment 
of 
mathematics 
and 
the 
natural 
sciences. 


In 
accepting 
your 
invitation 
to 
speak 
here 
on 
the 
relative 
educational 
value 
of 
the 
classical 
and 
the 
mathematico-physical 
sciences 
in 
colleges 
and 
high 
schools, 
I 
find 
my 
justification 
in 
the 
duty 
and 
the 
necessity 
laid 
upon 
every 
teacher 
of 
forming 
from 
his 
own 
experiences 
an 
opinion 
upon 
this 
important 
question, 
as 
partly 
also 
in 
the 
special 
circumstance 
that 
in 
my 
youth 
I 
was 
personally 
under 
the 
influence 
of 
school-life 
for 
only 
a 
short 
time, 
just 
previous 
to 
my 
entering 
the 
university, 
and 
had, 
therefore, 
ample 
opportunity 
to 
observe 
the 
effects 
of 
widely 
different 
methods 
upon 
my 
own 
person. 


Passing 
now, 
to 
a 
review 
of 
the 
arguments 
which 
the 
advocates 
of 
instruction 
in 
the 
classics 
advance, 
and 
of 
what 
the 
adherents 
of 
instruction 
in 
the 
physical 
sciences 
in 
their 
turn 
adduce, 
we 
find 
ourselves 
in 
rather 
a 
perplexing 
position 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
arguments 
of 
the 
first 
named. 
For 
these 
have 
been 
different 
at 
different 
times, 
and 
they 
are 
even 
now 
of 
a 
very 
multifarious 
character, 
as 
must 
be 
where 
men 
advance, 
in 
favor 
of 
an 
institution 
that 
exists 
and 
which 
they 
are 
determined 
to 
retain 
at 
any 
cost, 



everything 
they 
can 
possibly 
think 
of. 
We 
shall 
find 
here 
much 
that 
has 
evidently 
been 
brought 
forward 
only 
to 
impress 
the 
minds 
of 
the 
ignorant; 
much, 
too, 
that 
was 
advanced 
in 
good 
faith 
and 
which 
is 
not 
wholly 
without 
foundation. 
We 
shall 
get 
a 
fair 
idea 
of 
the 
reasoning 
employed 
by 
considering, 
first, 
the 
arguments 
that 
have 
grown 
out 
of 
the 
historical 
circumstances 
connected 
with 
the 
original 
introduction 
of 
the 
classics, 
and, 
lastly, 
those 
which 
were 
subsequently 
adduced 
as 
accidental 
afterthoughts. 


Instruction 
in 
Latin, 
as 
Paulsen 
[115] 
has 
minutely 
shown, 
was 
introduced 
by 
the 
Roman 
Church 
along 
with 
Christianity. 
With 
the 
Latin 
language 
were 
also 
transmitted 
the 
scant 
and 
meagre 
remnants 
of 
ancient 
science. 
Whoever 
wished 
to 
acquire 
this 
ancient 
education, 
then 
the 
only 
one 
worthy 
of 
the 
name, 
for 
him 
the 
Latin 
language 
was 
the 
only 
and 
indispensable 
means; 
such 
a 
person 
had 
to 
learn 
Latin 
to 
rank 
among 
educated 
people. 


The 
wide-spread 
influence 
of 
the 
Roman 
Church 
wrought 
many 
and 
various 
results. 
Among 
those 
for 
which 
all 
are 
glad, 
we 
may 
safely 
count 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
sort 
of 
uniformity 
among 
the 
nations 
and 
of 
a 
regular 
international 
intercourse 
by 
means 
of 
the 
Latin 
language, 
which 
did 
much 
to 
unite 
the 
nations 
in 
the 
common 
work 
of 
civilisation, 
carried 
on 
from 
the 
fifteenth 
to 
the 
eighteenth 
century. 
The 
Latin 
language 
was 
thus 
long 
the 
language 
of 
scholars, 
and 
instruction 
in 
Latin 
the 
road 
to 
a 
liberal 
education 
—a 
shibboleth 
still 
employed, 
though 
long 
inappropriate. 


For 
scholars 
as 
a 
class, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
regretted, 
perhaps, 
that 
Latin 
has 
ceased 
to 
be 
the 
medium 
of 
international 
communication. 
But 
the 
attributing 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
this 
function 
by 
the 
Latin 
language 
to 
its 
incapacity 
to 
accommodate 
itself 
to 
the 
numerous 
new 
ideas 
and 
conceptions 
which 
have 
arisen 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
development 
of 
science 
is, 
in 
my 
opinion, 
wholly 
erroneous. 
It 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
find 
a 
modern 
scientist 
who 
had 
enriched 
science 
with 
as 
many 
new 
ideas 
as 
Newton 
has, 
yet 
Newton 
knew 
how 
to 
express 
those 
ideas 
very 
correctly 
and 
precisely 
in 
the 
Latin 
language. 
If 
this 
view 
were 
correct, 
it 
would 
also 
hold 
true 
of 
every 
living 
language. 
Originally 
every 
language 
has 
to 
adapt 
itself 
to 
new 
ideas. 


It 
is 
far 
more 
likely 
that 
Latin 
was 
displaced 
as 
the 
literary 
vehicle 
of 
science 



by 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
nobility. 
By 
their 
desire 
to 
enjoy 
the 
fruits 
of 
literature 
and 
science, 
through 
a 
less 
irksome 
medium 
than 
Latin, 
the 
nobility 
performed 
for 
the 
people 
at 
large 
an 
undeniable 
service. 
For 
the 
days 
were 
now 
past 
when 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
language 
and 
literature 
of 
science 
was 
restricted 
to 
a 
caste, 
and 
in 
this 
step, 
perhaps, 
was 
made 
the 
most 
important 
advance 
of 
modern 
times. 
To-day, 
when 
international 
intercourse 
is 
firmly 
established 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
many 
languages 
employed, 
no 
one 
would 
think 
of 
reintroducing 
Latin. 
[116] 


The 
facility 
with 
which 
the 
ancient 
languages 
lend 
themselves 
to 
the 
expression 
of 
new 
ideas 
is 
evidenced 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
great 
majority 
of 
our 
scientific 
ideas, 
as 
survivals 
of 
this 
period 
of 
Latin 
intercourse, 
bear 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
designations, 
while 
in 
great 
measure 
scientific 
ideas 
are 
even 
now 
invested 
with 
names 
from 
these 
sources. 
But 
to 
deduce 
from 
the 
existence 
and 
use 
of 
such 
terms 
the 
necessity 
of 
still 
learning 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
on 
the 
part 
of 
all 
who 
employ 
them 
is 
carrying 
the 
conclusion 
too 
far. 
All 
terms, 
appropriate 
and 
inappropriate,—and 
there 
are 
a 
large 
number 
of 
inappropriate 
and 
monstrous 
combinations 
in 
science,—rest 
on 
convention. 
The 
essential 
thing 
is, 
that 
people 
should 
associate 
with 
the 
sign 
the 
precise 
idea 
that 
is 
designated 
by 
it. 
It 
matters 
little 
whether 
a 
person 
can 
correctly 
derive 
the 
words 
telegraph, 
tangent, 
ellipse, 
evolute, 
etc., 
if 
the 
correct 
idea 
is 
present 
in 
his 
mind 
when 
he 
uses 
them. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
no 
matter 
how 
well 
he 
may 
know 
their 
etymology, 
his 
knowledge 
will 
be 
of 
little 
use 
to 
him 
if 
the 
correct 
idea 
is 
absent. 
Ask 
the 
average 
and 
fairly 
educated 
classical 
scholar 
to 
translate 
a 
few 
lines 
for 
you 
from 
Newton's 
Principia, 
or 
from 
Huygens's 
Horologium, 
and 
you 
will 
discover 
at 
once 
what 
an 
extremely 
subordinate 
rôle 
the 
mere 
knowledge 
of 
language 
plays 
in 
such 
things. 
Without 
its 
associated 
thought 
a 
word 
remains 
a 
mere 
sound. 
The 
fashion 
of 
employing 
Greek 
and 
Latin 
designations—for 
it 
can 
be 
termed 
nothing 
else—has 
a 
natural 
root 
in 
history; 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
the 
practice 
to 
disappear 
suddenly, 
but 
it 
has 
fallen 
of 
late 
considerably 
into 
disuse. 
The 
terms 
gas, 
ohm, 
Ampère, 
volt, 
etc., 
are 
in 
international 
use, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
Latin 
nor 
Greek. 
Only 
the 
person 
who 
rates 
the 
unessential 
and 
accidental 
husk 
higher 
than 
its 
contents, 
can 
speak 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
learning 
Latin 
or 
Greek 
for 
such 
reasons, 
to 
say 
nothing 
of 
spending 
eight 
or 
ten 
years 
on 
the 
task. 
Will 
not 
a 
dictionary 
supply 
in 
a 
few 
seconds 
all 
the 
information 
we 
wish 
on 
such 
subjects? 
[117] 



It 
is 
indisputable 
that 
our 
modern 
civilisation 
took 
up 
the 
threads 
of 
the 
ancient 
civilisation, 
that 
at 
many 
points 
it 
begins 
where 
the 
latter 
left 
off, 
and 
that 
centuries 
ago 
the 
remains 
of 
the 
ancient 
culture 
were 
the 
only 
culture 
existing 
in 
Europe. 
Then, 
of 
course, 
a 
classical 
education 
really 
was 
the 
liberal 
education, 
the 
higher 
education, 
the 
ideal 
education, 
for 
it 
was 
the 
sole 
education. 
But 
when 
the 
same 
claim 
is 
now 
raised 
in 
behalf 
of 
a 
classical 
education, 
it 
must 
be 
uncompromisingly 
contested 
as 
bereft 
of 
all 
foundation. 
For 
our 
civilisation 
has 
gradually 
attained 
its 
independence; 
it 
has 
lifted 
itself 
far 
above 
the 
ancient 
civilisation, 
and 
has 
entered 
generally 
new 
directions 
of 
progress. 
Its 
note, 
its 
characteristic 
feature, 
is 
the 
enlightenment 
that 
has 
come 
from 
the 
great 
mathematical 
and 
physical 
researches 
of 
the 
last 
centuries, 
and 
which 
has 
permeated 
not 
only 
the 
practical 
arts 
and 
industries 
but 
is 
also 
gradually 
finding 
its 
way 
into 
all 
fields 
of 
thought, 
including 
philosophy 
and 
history, 
sociology 
and 
linguistics. 
Those 
traces 
of 
ancient 
views 
that 
are 
still 
discoverable 
in 
philosophy, 
law, 
art, 
and 
science, 
operate 
more 
as 
hindrances 
than 
helps, 
and 
will 
not 
long 
stand 
before 
the 
development 
of 
independent 
and 
more 
natural 
views. 


It 
ill 
becomes 
classical 
scholars, 
therefore, 
to 
regard 
themselves, 
at 
this 
day, 
as 
the 
educated 
class 
par 
excellence, 
to 
condemn 
as 
uneducated 
all 
persons 
who 
do 
not 
understand 
Latin 
and 
Greek, 
to 
complain 
that 
with 
such 
people 
profitable 
conversations 
are 
not 
to 
be 
carried 
on, 
etc. 
The 
most 
delectable 
stories 
have 
got 
into 
circulation, 
illustrative 
of 
the 
defective 
education 
of 
scientists 
and 
engineers. 
A 
renowned 
inquirer, 
for 
example, 
is 
said 
to 
have 
once 
announced 
his 
intention 
of 
holding 
a 
free 
course 
of 
university 
lectures, 
with 
the 
word 
"frustra"; 
an 
engineer 
who 
spent 
his 
leisure 
hours 
in 
collecting 
insects 
is 
said 
to 
have 
declared 
that 
he 
was 
studying 
"etymology." 
It 
is 
true, 
incidents 
of 
this 
character 
make 
us 
shudder 
or 
smile, 
according 
to 
our 
mood 
or 
temperament. 
But 
we 
must 
admit, 
the 
next 
moment, 
that 
in 
giving 
way 
to 
such 
feelings 
we 
have 
merely 
succumbed 
to 
a 
childish 
prejudice. 
A 
lack 
of 
tact 
but 
certainly 
no 
lack 
of 
education 
is 
displayed 
in 
the 
use 
of 
such 
half-
understood 
expressions. 
Every 
candid 
person 
will 
confess 
that 
there 
are 
many 
branches 
of 
knowledge 
about 
which 
he 
had 
better 
be 
silent. 
We 
shall 
not 
be 
so 
uncharitable 
as 
to 
turn 
the 
tables 
and 
discuss 
the 
impression 
that 
classical 
scholars 
might 
make 
on 
a 
scientist 
or 
engineer, 
in 
speaking 
of 
science. 
Possibly 
many 
ludicrous 
stories 
might 
be 
told 
of 
them, 
and 
of 
far 
more 
serious 
import, 
which 
should 
fully 
compensate 
for 
the 
blunders 
of 
the 
other 



party. 


The 
mutual 
severity 
of 
judgment 
which 
we 
have 
here 
come 
upon, 
may 
also 
forcibly 
bring 
home 
to 
us 
how 
really 
scarce 
a 
true 
liberal 
culture 
is. 
We 
may 
detect 
in 
this 
mutual 
attitude, 
too, 
something 
of 
that 
narrow, 
mediæval 
arrogance 
of 
caste, 
where 
a 
man 
began, 
according 
to 
the 
special 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
speaker, 
with 
the 
scholar, 
the 
soldier, 
or 
the 
nobleman. 
Little 
sense 
or 
appreciation 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
it 
for 
the 
common 
task 
of 
humanity, 
little 
feeling 
for 
the 
need 
of 
mutual 
assistance 
in 
the 
great 
work 
of 
civilisation, 
little 
breadth 
of 
mind, 
little 
truly 
liberal 
culture. 


A 
knowledge 
of 
Latin, 
and 
partly, 
also, 
a 
knowledge 
of 
Greek, 
is 
still 
a 
necessity 
for 
the 
members 
of 
a 
few 
professions 
by 
nature 
more 
or 
less 
directly 
concerned 
with 
the 
civilisations 
of 
antiquity, 
as 
for 
lawyers, 
theologians, 
philologists, 
historians, 
and 
generally 
for 
a 
small 
number 
of 
persons, 
among 
whom 
from 
time 
to 
time 
I 
count 
myself, 
who 
are 
compelled 
to 
seek 
for 
information 
in 
the 
Latin 
literature 
of 
the 
centuries 
just 
past. 
[118] 
But 
that 
all 
young 
persons 
in 
search 
of 
a 
higher 
education 
should 
pursue 
for 
this 
reason 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
to 
such 
excess; 
that 
persons 
intending 
to 
become 
physicians 
and 
scientists 
should 
come 
to 
the 
universities 
defectively 
educated, 
or 
even 
miseducated; 
and 
that 
they 
should 
be 
compelled 
to 
come 
only 
from 
schools 
that 
do 
not 
supply 
them 
with 
the 
proper 
preparatory 
knowledge 
is 
going 
a 
little 
bit 
too 
far. 


After 
the 
conditions 
which 
had 
given 
to 
the 
study 
of 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
their 
high 
import 
had 
ceased 
to 
exist, 
the 
traditional 
curriculum, 
naturally, 
was 
retained. 
Then, 
the 
different 
effects 
of 
this 
method 
of 
education, 
good 
and 
bad, 
which 
no 
one 
had 
thought 
of 
at 
its 
introduction, 
were 
realised 
and 
noted. 
As 
natural, 
too, 
was 
it 
that 
those 
who 
had 
strong 
interests 
in 
the 
preservation 
of 
these 
studies, 
from 
knowing 
no 
others 
or 
from 
living 
by 
them, 
or 
for 
still 
other 
reasons, 
should 
emphasise 
the 
good 
results 
of 
such 
instruction. 
They 
pointed 
to 
the 
good 
effects 
as 
if 
they 
had 
been 
consciously 
aimed 
at 
by 
the 
method 
and 
could 
be 
attained 
only 
through 
its 
agency. 


One 
real 
benefit 
that 
students 
might 
derive 
from 
a 
rightly 
conducted 
course 
in 
the 
classics 
would 
be 
the 
opening 
up 
of 
the 
rich 
literary 
treasures 
of 
antiquity, 



and 
intimacy 
with 
the 
conceptions 
and 
views 
of 
the 
world 
held 
by 
two 
advanced 
nations. 
A 
person 
who 
has 
read 
and 
understood 
the 
Greek 
and 
Roman 
authors 
has 
felt 
and 
experienced 
more 
than 
one 
who 
is 
restricted 
to 
the 
impressions 
of 
the 
present. 
He 
sees 
how 
men 
placed 
in 
different 
circumstances 
judge 
quite 
differently 
of 
the 
same 
things 
from 
what 
we 
do 
today. 
His 
own 
judgments 
will 
be 
rendered 
thus 
more 
independent. 
Again, 
the 
Greek 
and 
Latin 
authors 
are 
indisputably 
a 
rich 
fountain 
of 
recreation, 
of 
enlightenment, 
and 
of 
intellectual 
pleasure 
after 
the 
day's 
toil, 
and 
the 
individual, 
not 
less 
than 
civilised 
humanity 
generally, 
will 
remain 
grateful 
to 
them 
for 
all 
time. 
Who 
does 
not 
recall 
with 
pleasure 
the 
wanderings 
of 
Ulysses, 
who 
does 
not 
listen 
joyfully 
to 
the 
simple 
narratives 
of 
Herodotus, 
who 
would 
ever 
repent 
of 
having 
made 
the 
acquaintance 
of 
Plato's 
Dialogues, 
or 
of 
having 
tasted 
Lucian's 
divine 
humor? 
Who 
would 
give 
up 
the 
glances 
he 
has 
obtained 
into 
the 
private 
life 
of 
antiquity 
from 
Cicero's 
letters, 
from 
Plautus 
or 
Terence? 
To 
whom 
are 
not 
the 
portraits 
of 
Suetonius 
undying 
reminiscences? 
Who, 
in 
fact, 
would 
throw 
away 
any 
knowledge 
he 
had 
once 
gained? 


Yet 
people 
who 
draw 
from 
these 
sources 
only, 
who 
know 
only 
this 
culture, 
have 
surely 
no 
right 
to 
dogmatise 
about 
the 
value 
of 
some 
other 
culture. 
As 
objects 
of 
research 
for 
individuals, 
this 
literature 
is 
extremely 
valuable, 
but 
it 
is 
a 
different 
question 
whether 
it 
is 
equally 
valuable 
as 
the 
almost 
exclusive 
means 
of 
education 
of 
our 
youth. 


Do 
not 
other 
nations 
and 
other 
literatures 
exist 
from 
which 
we 
ought 
to 
learn? 
Is 
not 
nature 
herself 
our 
first 
school-mistress? 
Are 
our 
highest 
models 
always 
to 
be 
the 
Greeks, 
with 
their 
narrow 
provinciality 
of 
mind, 
that 
divided 
the 
world 
into 
"Greeks 
and 
barbarians," 
with 
their 
superstitions, 
with 
their 
eternal 
questioning 
of 
oracles? 
Aristotle 
with 
his 
incapacity 
to 
learn 
from 
facts, 
with 
his 
word-science; 
Plato 
with 
his 
heavy, 
interminable 
dialogues, 
with 
his 
barren, 
at 
times 
childish, 
dialectics—are 
they 
unsurpassable? 
[119] 
The 
Romans 
with 
their 
apathy, 
their 
pompous 
externality, 
set 
off 
by 
fulsome 
and 
bombastic 
phrases, 
with 
their 
narrow-minded, 
philistine 
philosophy, 
with 
their 
frenzied 
sensuality, 
with 
their 
cruel 
and 
bestial 
indulgence 
in 
animal 
and 
man 
baiting, 
with 
their 
outrageous 
maltreatment 
and 
plundering 
of 
their 
subjects—are 
they 
patterns 
worthy 
of 
imitation? 
Or 
shall, 
perhaps, 
our 
science 
edify 
itself 
with 
the 
works 
of 
Pliny 
who 
cites 
midwives 
as 
authorities 



and 
himself 
stands 
on 
their 
point 
of 
view? 


Besides, 
if 
an 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
ancient 
world 
really 
were 
attained, 
we 
might 
come 
to 
some 
settlement 
with 
the 
advocates 
of 
classical 
education. 
But 
it 
is 
words 
and 
forms, 
and 
forms 
and 
words 
only, 
that 
are 
supplied 
to 
our 
youth; 
and 
even 
collateral 
subjects 
are 
forced 
into 
the 
strait-jacket 
of 
the 
same 
rigid 
method 
and 
made 
a 
science 
of 
words, 
sheer 
feats 
of 
mechanical 
memory. 
Really, 
we 
feel 
ourselves 
set 
back 
a 
thousand 
years 
into 
the 
dull 
cloister-cells 
of 
the 
Middle 
Ages. 


This 
must 
be 
changed. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
get 
acquainted 
with 
the 
views 
of 
the 
Greeks 
and 
Romans 
by 
a 
shorter 
road 
than 
the 
intellect 
deadening 
process 
of 
eight 
or 
ten 
years 
of 
declining, 
conjugating, 
analysing, 
and 
extemporisation. 
There 
are 
to-day 
plenty 
of 
educated 
persons 
who 
have 
acquired 
through 
good 
translations 
vivider, 
clearer, 
and 
more 
just 
views 
of 
classical 
antiquity 
than 
the 
graduates 
of 
our 
gymnasiums 
and 
colleges. 
[120] 


For 
us 
moderns, 
the 
Greeks 
and 
the 
Romans 
are 
simply 
two 
objects 
of 
archæological 
and 
historical 
research 
like 
all 
others. 
If 
we 
put 
them 
before 
our 
youth 
in 
fresh 
and 
living 
pictures, 
and 
not 
merely 
in 
words 
and 
syllables, 
the 
effect 
will 
be 
assured. 
We 
derive 
a 
totally 
different 
enjoyment 
from 
the 
Greeks 
when 
we 
approach 
them 
after 
a 
study 
of 
the 
results 
of 
modern 
research 
in 
the 
history 
of 
civilisation. 
We 
read 
many 
a 
chapter 
of 
Herodotus 
differently 
when 
we 
attack 
his 
works 
equipped 
with 
a 
knowledge 
of 
natural 
science, 
and 
with 
information 
about 
the 
stone 
age 
and 
the 
lake-dwellers. 
What 
our 
classical 
institutions 
pretend 
to 
give 
can 
and 
actually 
will 
be 
given 
to 
our 
youth 
with 
much 
more 
fruitful 
results 
by 
competent 
historical 
instruction, 
which 
must 
supply, 
not 
names 
and 
numbers 
alone, 
nor 
the 
mere 
history 
of 
dynasties 
and 
wars, 
but 
be 
in 
every 
sense 
of 
the 
word 
a 
true 
history 
of 
civilisation. 


The 
view 
still 
widely 
prevails 
that 
although 
all 
"higher, 
ideal 
culture," 
all 
extension 
of 
our 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
is 
acquired 
by 
philological 
and 
in 
a 
lesser 
degree 
by 
historical 
studies, 
still 
the 
mathematics 
and 
natural 
sciences 
should 
not 
be 
neglected 
on 
account 
of 
their 
usefulness. 
This 
is 
an 
opinion 
to 
which 
I 
must 
refuse 
my 
assent. 
It 
were 
strange 
if 
man 
could 
learn 
more, 
could 
draw 
more 
intellectual 
nourishment, 
from 
the 
shards 
of 
a 
few 
old 
broken 
jugs, 
from 
inscribed 
stones, 
or 
yellow 
parchments, 
than 
from 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
nature. 
True, 



man 
is 
man's 
first 
concern, 
but 
he 
is 
not 
his 
sole 
concern. 


In 
ceasing 
to 
regard 
man 
as 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
world; 
in 
discovering 
that 
the 
earth 
is 
a 
top 
whirled 
about 
the 
sun, 
which 
speeds 
off 
with 
it 
into 
infinite 
space; 
in 
finding 
that 
in 
the 
fixed 
stars 
the 
same 
elements 
exist 
as 
on 
earth; 
in 
meeting 
everywhere 
the 
same 
processes 
of 
which 
the 
life 
of 
man 
is 
merely 
a 
vanishingly 
small 
part—in 
such 
things, 
too, 
is 
a 
widening 
of 
our 
view 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
edification, 
and 
poetry. 
There 
are 
here 
perhaps 
grander 
and 
more 
significant 
facts 
than 
the 
bellowing 
of 
the 
wounded 
Ares, 
or 
the 
charming 
island 
of 
Calypso, 
or 
the 
ocean-stream 
engirdling 
the 
earth. 
He 
only 
should 
speak 
of 
the 
relative 
value 
of 
these 
two 
domains 
of 
thought, 
of 
their 
poetry, 
who 
knows 
both. 


The 
"utility" 
of 
physical 
science 
is, 
in 
a 
measure, 
only 
a 
collateral 
product 
of 
that 
flight 
of 
the 
intellect 
which 
produced 
science. 
No 
one, 
however, 
should 
underrate 
the 
utility 
of 
science 
who 
has 
shared 
in 
the 
realisation 
by 
modern 
industrial 
art 
of 
the 
Oriental 
world 
of 
fables, 
much 
less 
one 
upon 
whom 
those 
treasures 
have 
been 
poured, 
as 
it 
were, 
from 
the 
fourth 
dimension, 
without 
his 
aid 
or 
understanding. 


Nor 
may 
we 
believe 
that 
science 
is 
useful 
only 
to 
the 
practical 
man. 
Its 
influence 
permeates 
all 
our 
affairs, 
our 
whole 
life; 
everywhere 
its 
ideas 
are 
decisive. 
How 
differently 
does 
the 
jurist, 
the 
legislator, 
or 
the 
political 
economist 
think, 
who 
knows, 
for 
example, 
that 
a 
square 
mile 
of 
the 
most 
fertile 
soil 
can 
support 
with 
the 
solar 
heat 
annually 
consumed 
only 
a 
definite 
number 
of 
human 
beings, 
which 
no 
art 
or 
science 
can 
increase. 
Many 
economical 
theories, 
which 
open 
new 
air-paths 
of 
progress, 
air-paths 
in 
the 
literal 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
would 
be 
made 
impossible 
by 
such 
knowledge. 


The 
eulogists 
of 
classical 
education 
love 
to 
emphasise 
the 
cultivation 
of 
taste 
which 
comes 
from 
employment 
with 
the 
ancient 
models. 
I 
candidly 
confess 
that 
there 
is 
something 
absolutely 
revolting 
in 
this 
to 
me. 
To 
form 
the 
taste, 
then, 
our 
youths 
must 
sacrifice 
ten 
years 
of 
their 
life! 
Luxury 
takes 
precedence 
over 
necessity. 
Have 
the 
future 
generations, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
difficult 
problems, 
the 
great 
social 
questions, 
which 
they 
must 
meet, 
and 
that 
with 
strengthened 
mind 
and 
heart, 
no 
more 
important 
duties 
to 
fulfil 
than 
these? 



But 
let 
us 
assume 
that 
this 
end 
were 
desirable. 
Can 
taste 
be 
formed 
by 
rules 
and 
precepts? 
Do 
not 
ideals 
of 
beauty 
change? 
Is 
it 
not 
a 
stupendous 
absurdity 
to 
force 
one's 
self 
artificially 
to 
admire 
things 
which, 
with 
all 
their 
historical 
interest, 
with 
all 
their 
beauty 
in 
individual 
points, 
are 
for 
the 
most 
part 
foreign 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
our 
thoughts 
and 
feelings, 
provided 
we 
have 
such 
of 
our 
own. 
A 
nation 
that 
is 
truly 
such, 
has 
its 
own 
taste 
and 
will 
not 
go 
to 
others 
for 
it. 
And 
every 
individual 
perfect 
man 
has 
his 
own 
taste. 
[121] 


And 
what, 
after 
all, 
does 
this 
cultivation 
of 
taste 
consist 
in? 
In 
the 
acquisition 
of 
the 
personal 
literary 
style 
of 
a 
few 
select 
authors! 
What 
should 
we 
think 
of 
a 
people 
that 
would 
force 
its 
youth 
a 
thousand 
years 
from 
now, 
by 
years 
of 
practice, 
to 
master 
the 
tortuous 
or 
bombastic 
style 
of 
some 
successful 
lawyer 
or 
politician 
of 
to-day? 
Should 
we 
not 
justly 
accuse 
them 
of 
a 
woful 
lack 
of 
taste? 


The 
evil 
effects 
of 
this 
imagined 
cultivation 
of 
the 
taste 
find 
expression 
often 
enough. 
The 
young 
savant 
who 
regards 
the 
composition 
of 
a 
scientific 
essay 
as 
a 
rhetorical 
exercise 
instead 
of 
a 
simple 
and 
unadorned 
presentation 
of 
the 
facts 
and 
the 
truth, 
still 
sits 
unconsciously 
on 
the 
school-bench, 
and 
still 
unwittingly 
represents 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
Romans, 
by 
whom 
the 
elaboration 
of 
speeches 
was 
regarded 
as 
a 
serious 
scientific 
(!) 
employment. 


Far 
be 
it 
from 
me 
to 
underrate 
the 
value 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
instinct 
of 
speech 
and 
of 
the 
increased 
comprehension 
of 
our 
own 
language 
which 
comes 
from 
philological 
studies. 
By 
the 
study 
of 
a 
foreign 
language, 
especially 
of 
one 
which 
differs 
widely 
from 
ours, 
the 
signs 
and 
forms 
of 
words 
are 
first 
clearly 
distinguished 
from 
the 
thoughts 
which 
they 
express. 
Words 
of 
the 
closest 
possible 
correspondence 
in 
different 
languages 
never 
coincide 
absolutely 
with 
the 
ideas 
they 
stand 
for, 
but 
place 
in 
relief 
slightly 
different 
aspects 
of 
the 
same 
thing, 
and 
by 
the 
study 
of 
language 
the 
attention 
is 
directed 
to 
these 
shades 
of 
difference. 
But 
it 
would 
be 
far 
from 
admissible 
to 
contend 
that 
the 
study 
of 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
is 
the 
most 
fruitful 
and 
natural, 
let 
alone 
the 
only, 
means 
of 
attaining 
this 
end. 
Any 
one 
who 
will 
give 
himself 
the 
pleasure 
of 
a 
few 
hours' 
companionship 
with 
a 
Chinese 
grammar; 
who 
will 
seek 
to 
make 
clear 
to 
himself 
the 
mode 
of 
speech 
and 
thought 
of 
a 
people 
who 
never 
advanced 
as 
far 
as 
the 
analysis 
of 
articulate 
sounds, 
but 
stopped 
at 



the 
analysis 
of 
syllables, 
to 
whom 
our 
alphabetical 
characters, 
therefore, 
are 
an 
inexplicable 
puzzle, 
and 
who 
express 
all 
their 
rich 
and 
profound 
thoughts 
by 
means 
of 
a 
few 
syllables 
with 
variable 
emphasis 
and 
position,—such 
a 
person, 
perhaps, 
will 
acquire 
new, 
and 
extremely 
elucidative 
ideas 
upon 
the 
relation 
of 
language 
and 
thought. 
But 
should 
our 
children, 
therefore, 
study 
Chinese? 
Certainly 
not. 
No 
more, 
then, 
should 
they 
be 
burdened 
with 
Latin, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
measure 
they 
are. 


It 
is 
a 
beautiful 
achievement 
to 
reproduce 
a 
Latin 
thought 
in 
a 
modern 
language 
with 
the 
maximum 
fidelity 
of 
meaning 
and 
expression—for 
the 
translator. 
Moreover, 
we 
shall 
be 
very 
grateful 
to 
the 
translator 
for 
his 
performance. 
But 
to 
demand 
this 
feat 
of 
every 
educated 
man, 
without 
consideration 
of 
the 
sacrifice 
of 
time 
and 
labor 
which 
it 
entails, 
is 
unreasonable. 
And 
for 
this 
very 
reason, 
as 
classical 
teachers 
admit, 
that 
ideal 
is 
never 
perfectly 
attained, 
except 
in 
rare 
cases 
with 
scholars 
possessed 
of 
special 
talents 
and 
great 
industry. 
Without 
slurring, 
therefore, 
the 
high 
importance 
of 
the 
study 
of 
the 
ancient 
languages 
as 
a 
profession, 
we 
may 
yet 
feel 
sure 
that 
the 
instinct 
for 
speech 
which 
is 
part 
of 
every 
liberal 
education 
can, 
and 
must, 
be 
acquired 
in 
a 
different 
way. 
Should 
we, 
indeed, 
be 
forever 
lost 
if 
the 
Greeks 
had 
not 
lived 
before 
us? 


The 
fact 
is, 
we 
must 
carry 
our 
demands 
further 
than 
the 
representatives 
of 
classical 
philology. 
We 
must 
ask 
of 
every 
educated 
man 
a 
fair 
scientific 
conception 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
value 
of 
language, 
of 
the 
formation 
of 
language, 
of 
the 
alteration 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
roots, 
of 
the 
degeneration 
of 
fixed 
forms 
of 
speech 
to 
grammatical 
forms, 
in 
brief, 
of 
all 
the 
main 
results 
of 
modern 
comparative 
philology. 
We 
should 
judge 
that 
this 
were 
attainable 
by 
a 
careful 
study 
of 
our 
mother 
tongue 
and 
of 
the 
languages 
next 
allied 
to 
it, 
and 
subsequently 
of 
the 
more 
ancient 
tongues 
from 
which 
the 
former 
are 
derived. 
If 
any 
one 
object 
that 
this 
is 
too 
difficult 
and 
entails 
too 
much 
labor, 
I 
should 
advise 
such 
a 
person 
to 
place 
side 
by 
side 
an 
English, 
a 
Dutch, 
a 
Danish, 
a 
Swedish, 
and 
a 
German 
Bible, 
and 
to 
compare 
a 
few 
lines 
of 
them; 
he 
will 
be 
amazed 
at 
the 
multitude 
of 
suggestions 
that 
offer 
themselves. 
[122] 
In 
fact, 
I 
believe 
that 
a 
really 
progressive, 
fruitful, 
rational, 
and 
instructive 
study 
of 
languages 
can 
be 
conducted 
only 
on 
this 
plan. 
Many 
of 
my 
audience 
will 
remember, 
perhaps, 
the 
bright 
and 
encouraging 
effect, 
like 
that 
of 
a 
ray 
of 
sunlight 
on 
a 
gloomy 
day, 
which 
the 
meagre 
and 
furtive 
remarks 
on 



comparative 
philology 
in 
Curtius's 
Greek 
grammar 
wrought 
in 
that 
barren 
and 
lifeless 
desert 
of 
verbal 
quibbles. 


The 
principal 
result 
obtained 
by 
the 
present 
method 
of 
studying 
the 
ancient 
languages 
is 
that 
which 
comes 
from 
the 
student's 
employment 
with 
their 
complicated 
grammars. 
It 
consists 
in 
the 
sharpening 
of 
the 
attention 
and 
in 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
judgment 
by 
the 
practice 
of 
subsuming 
special 
cases 
under 
general 
rules, 
and 
of 
distinguishing 
between 
different 
cases. 
Obviously, 
the 
same 
result 
can 
be 
reached 
by 
many 
other 
methods; 
for 
example, 
by 
difficult 
games 
of 
cards. 
Every 
science, 
the 
mathematics 
and 
the 
physical 
sciences 
included, 
accomplish 
as 
much, 
if 
not 
more, 
in 
this 
disciplining 
of 
the 
judgment. 
In 
addition, 
the 
matter 
treated 
by 
those 
sciences 
has 
a 
much 
higher 
intrinsic 
interest 
for 
young 
people, 
and 
so 
engages 
spontaneously 
their 
attention; 
while 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
they 
are 
elucidative 
and 
useful 
in 
other 
directions 
in 
which 
grammar 
can 
accomplish 
nothing. 


Who 
cares, 
so 
far 
as 
the 
matter 
of 
it 
is 
concerned, 
whether 
we 
say 
hominum 
or 
hominorum 
in 
the 
genitive 
plural, 
interesting 
as 
the 
fact 
may 
be 
for 
the 
philologist? 
And 
who 
would 
dispute 
that 
the 
intellectual 
need 
of 
causal 
insight 
is 
awakened 
not 
by 
grammar 
but 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences? 


It 
is 
not 
our 
intention, 
therefore, 
to 
gainsay 
in 
the 
least 
the 
good 
influence 
which 
the 
study 
of 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
grammar 
also 
exercises 
on 
the 
sharpening 
of 
the 
judgment. 
In 
so 
far 
as 
the 
study 
of 
words 
as 
such 
must 
greatly 
promote 
lucidity 
and 
accuracy 
of 
expression, 
in 
so 
far 
as 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
are 
not 
yet 
wholly 
indispensable 
to 
many 
branches 
of 
knowledge, 
we 
willingly 
concede 
to 
them 
a 
place 
in 
our 
schools, 
but 
would 
demand 
that 
the 
disproportionate 
amount 
of 
time 
allotted 
to 
them, 
wrongly 
withdrawn 
from 
other 
useful 
studies, 
should 
be 
considerably 
curtailed. 
That 
in 
the 
end 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
will 
not 
be 
employed 
as 
the 
universal 
means 
of 
education, 
we 
are 
fully 
convinced. 
They 
will 
be 
relegated 
to 
the 
closet 
of 
the 
scholar 
or 
professional 
philologist, 
and 
gradually 
make 
way 
for 
the 
modern 
languages 
and 
the 
modern 
science 
of 
language. 


Long 
ago 
Locke 
reduced 
to 
their 
proper 
limits 
the 
exaggerated 
notions 
which 
obtained 
of 
the 
close 
connexion 
of 
thought 
and 
speech, 
of 
logic 
and 
grammar, 
and 
recent 
investigators 
have 
established 
on 
still 
surer 
foundations 
his 
views. 



How 
little 
a 
complicated 
grammar 
is 
necessary 
for 
expressing 
delicate 
shades 
of 
thought 
is 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
Italians 
and 
French, 
who, 
although 
they 
have 
almost 
totally 
discarded 
the 
grammatical 
redundancies 
of 
the 
Romans, 
are 
yet 
not 
surpassed 
by 
the 
latter 
in 
accuracy 
of 
thought, 
and 
whose 
poetical, 
but 
especially 
whose 
scientific 
literature, 
as 
no 
one 
will 
dispute, 
can 
bear 
favorable 
comparison 
with 
the 
Roman. 


Reviewing 
again 
the 
arguments 
advanced 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
study 
of 
the 
ancient 
languages, 
we 
are 
obliged 
to 
say 
that 
in 
the 
main 
and 
as 
applied 
to 
the 
present, 
they 
are 
wholly 
devoid 
of 
force. 
In 
so 
far 
as 
the 
aims 
which 
this 
study 
theoretically 
pursues 
are 
still 
worthy 
of 
attainment, 
they 
appear 
to 
us 
as 
altogether 
too 
narrow, 
and 
are 
surpassed 
in 
this 
only 
by 
the 
means 
employed. 
As 
almost 
the 
sole, 
indisputable 
result 
of 
this 
study 
we 
must 
count 
the 
increase 
of 
the 
student's 
skill 
and 
precision 
in 
expression. 
One 
inclined 
to 
be 
uncharitable 
might 
say 
that 
our 
gymnasiums 
and 
classical 
academies 
turn 
out 
men 
who 
can 
speak 
and 
write, 
but, 
unfortunately, 
have 
little 
to 
write 
or 
speak 
about. 
Of 
that 
broad, 
liberal 
view, 
of 
that 
famed 
universal 
culture, 
which 
the 
classical 
curriculum 
is 
supposed 
to 
yield, 
serious 
words 
need 
not 
be 
lost. 
This 
culture 
might, 
perhaps, 
more 
properly 
be 
termed 
the 
contracted 
or 
lopsided 
culture. 


While 
considering 
the 
study 
of 
languages 
we 
threw 
a 
few 
side 
glances 
at 
mathematics 
and 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Let 
us 
now 
inquire 
whether 
these, 
as 
branches 
of 
study, 
cannot 
accomplish 
much 
that 
is 
to 
be 
attained 
in 
no 
other 
way. 
I 
shall 
meet 
with 
no 
contradiction 
when 
I 
say 
that 
without 
at 
least 
an 
elementary 
mathematical 
and 
scientific 
education 
a 
man 
remains 
a 
total 
stranger 
in 
the 
world 
in 
which 
he 
lives, 
a 
stranger 
in 
the 
civilisation 
of 
the 
time 
that 
bears 
him. 
Whatever 
he 
meets 
in 
nature, 
or 
in 
the 
industrial 
world, 
either 
does 
not 
appeal 
to 
him 
at 
all, 
from 
his 
having 
neither 
eye 
nor 
ear 
for 
it, 
or 
it 
speaks 
to 
him 
in 
a 
totally 
unintelligible 
language. 


A 
real 
understanding 
of 
the 
world 
and 
its 
civilisation, 
however, 
is 
not 
the 
only 
result 
of 
the 
study 
of 
mathematics 
and 
the 
physical 
sciences. 
Much 
more 
essential 
for 
the 
preparatory 
school 
is 
the 
formal 
cultivation 
which 
comes 
from 
these 
studies, 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
reason 
and 
the 
judgment, 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
imagination. 
Mathematics, 
physics, 
chemistry, 
and 
the 
so



called 
descriptive 
sciences 
are 
so 
much 
alike 
in 
this 
respect, 
that, 
apart 
from 
a 
few 
points, 
we 
need 
not 
separate 
them 
in 
our 
discussion. 


Logical 
sequence 
and 
continuity 
of 
ideas, 
so 
necessary 
for 
fruitful 
thought, 
are 
par 
excellence 
the 
results 
of 
mathematics; 
the 
ability 
to 
follow 
facts 
with 
thoughts, 
that 
is, 
to 
observe 
or 
collect 
experiences, 
is 
chiefly 
developed 
by 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
Whether 
we 
notice 
that 
the 
sides 
and 
the 
angles 
of 
a 
triangle 
are 
connected 
in 
a 
definite 
way, 
that 
an 
equilateral 
triangle 
possesses 
certain 
definite 
properties 
of 
symmetry, 
or 
whether 
we 
notice 
the 
deflexion 
of 
a 
magnetic 
needle 
by 
an 
electric 
current, 
the 
dissolution 
of 
zinc 
in 
diluted 
sulphuric 
acid, 
whether 
we 
remark 
that 
the 
wings 
of 
a 
butterfly 
are 
slightly 
colored 
on 
the 
under, 
and 
the 
fore-wings 
of 
the 
moth 
on 
the 
upper, 
surface: 
indiscriminately 
here 
we 
proceed 
from 
observations, 
from 
individual 
acts 
of 
immediate 
intuitive 
knowledge. 
The 
field 
of 
observation 
is 
more 
restricted 
and 
lies 
closer 
at 
hand 
in 
mathematics; 
it 
is 
more 
varied 
and 
broader 
but 
more 
difficult 
to 
compass 
in 
the 
natural 
sciences. 
The 
essential 
thing, 
however, 
is 
for 
the 
student 
to 
learn 
to 
make 
observations 
in 
all 
these 
fields. 
The 
philosophical 
question 
whether 
our 
acts 
of 
knowledge 
in 
mathematics 
are 
of 
a 
special 
kind 
is 
here 
of 
no 
importance 
for 
us. 
It 
is 
true, 
of 
course, 
that 
the 
observation 
can 
be 
practised 
by 
languages 
also. 
But 
no 
one, 
surely, 
will 
deny, 
that 
the 
concrete, 
living 
pictures 
presented 
in 
the 
fields 
just 
mentioned 
possess 
different 
and 
more 
powerful 
attractions 
for 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
youth 
than 
the 
abstract 
and 
hazy 
figures 
which 
language 
offers, 
and 
on 
which 
the 
attention 
is 
certainly 
not 
so 
spontaneously 
bestowed, 
nor 
with 
such 
good 
results. 
[123] 


Observation 
having 
revealed 
the 
different 
properties 
of 
a 
given 
geometrical 
or 
physical 
object, 
it 
is 
discovered 
that 
in 
many 
cases 
these 
properties 
depend 
in 
some 
way 
upon 
one 
another. 
This 
interdependence 
of 
properties 
(say 
that 
of 
equal 
sides 
and 
equal 
angles 
at 
the 
base 
of 
a 
triangle, 
the 
relation 
of 
pressure 
to 
motion,) 
is 
nowhere 
so 
distinctly 
marked, 
nowhere 
is 
the 
necessity 
and 
permanency 
of 
the 
interdependence 
so 
plainly 
noticeable, 
as 
in 
the 
fields 
mentioned. 
Hence 
the 
continuity 
and 
logical 
consequence 
of 
the 
ideas 
which 
we 
acquire 
in 
those 
fields. 
The 
relative 
simplicity 
and 
perspicuity 
of 
geometrical 
and 
physical 
relations 
supply 
here 
the 
conditions 
of 
natural 
and 
easy 
progress. 
Relations 
of 
equal 
simplicity 
are 
not 
met 
with 
in 
the 
fields 
which 
the 
study 
of 
language 
opens 
up. 
Many 
of 
you, 
doubtless, 
have 
often 



wondered 
at 
the 
little 
respect 
for 
the 
notions 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
and 
their 
connexion 
that 
is 
sometimes 
found 
among 
professed 
representatives 
of 
the 
classical 
studies. 
The 
explanation 
is 
probably 
to 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
analogous 
relation 
of 
motive 
and 
action 
familiar 
to 
them 
from 
their 
studies, 
presents 
nothing 
like 
the 
clear 
simplicity 
and 
determinateness 
that 
the 
relation 
of 
cause 
and 
effect 
does. 


That 
perfect 
mental 
grasp 
of 
all 
possible 
cases, 
that 
economical 
order 
and 
organic 
union 
of 
the 
thoughts 
which 
comes 
from 
it, 
which 
has 
grown 
for 
every 
one 
who 
has 
ever 
tasted 
it 
a 
permanent 
need 
which 
he 
seeks 
to 
satisfy 
in 
every 
new 
province, 
can 
be 
developed 
only 
by 
employment 
with 
the 
relative 
simplicity 
of 
mathematical 
and 
scientific 
investigations. 


When 
a 
set 
of 
facts 
comes 
into 
apparent 
conflict 
with 
another 
set 
of 
facts, 
and 
a 
problem 
is 
presented, 
its 
solution 
consists 
ordinarily 
in 
a 
more 
refined 
distinction 
or 
in 
a 
more 
extended 
view 
of 
the 
facts, 
as 
may 
be 
aptly 
illustrated 
by 
Newton's 
solution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
dispersion. 
When 
a 
new 
mathematical 
or 
scientific 
fact 
is 
demonstrated, 
or 
explained, 
such 
demonstration 
also 
rests 
simply 
upon 
showing 
the 
connexion 
of 
the 
new 
fact 
with 
the 
facts 
already 
known; 
for 
example, 
that 
the 
radius 
of 
a 
circle 
can 
be 
laid 
off 
as 
chord 
exactly 
six 
times 
in 
the 
circle 
is 
explained 
or 
proved 
by 
dividing 
the 
regular 
hexagon 
inscribed 
in 
the 
circle 
into 
equilateral 
triangles. 
That 
the 
quantity 
of 
heat 
developed 
in 
a 
second 
in 
a 
wire 
conveying 
an 
electric 
current 
is 
quadrupled 
on 
the 
doubling 
of 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
current, 
we 
explain 
from 
the 
doubling 
of 
the 
fall 
of 
the 
potential 
due 
to 
the 
doubling 
of 
the 
current's 
intensity, 
as 
also 
from 
the 
doubling 
of 
the 
quantity 
flowing 
through, 
in 
a 
word, 
from 
the 
quadrupling 
of 
the 
work 
done. 
In 
point 
of 
principle, 
explanation 
and 
direct 
proof 
do 
not 
differ 
much. 


He 
who 
solves 
scientifically 
a 
geometrical, 
physical, 
or 
technical 
problem, 
easily 
remarks 
that 
his 
procedure 
is 
a 
methodical 
mental 
quest, 
rendered 
possible 
by 
the 
economical 
order 
of 
the 
province—a 
simplified 
purposeful 
quest 
as 
contrasted 
with 
unmethodical, 
unscientific 
guess-work. 
The 
geometer, 
for 
example, 
who 
has 
to 
construct 
a 
circle 
touching 
two 
given 
straight 
lines, 
casts 
his 
eye 
over 
the 
relations 
of 
symmetry 
of 
the 
desired 
construction, 
and 
seeks 
the 
centre 
of 
his 
circle 
solely 
in 
the 
line 
of 
symmetry 
of 
the 
two 
straight 
lines. 
The 
person 
who 
wants 
a 
triangle 
of 
which 
two 



angles 
and 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
sides 
are 
given, 
grasps 
in 
his 
mind 
the 
determinateness 
of 
the 
form 
of 
this 
triangle 
and 
restricts 
his 
search 
for 
it 
to 
a 
certain 
group 
of 
triangles 
of 
the 
same 
form. 
Under 
very 
different 
circumstances, 
therefore, 
the 
simplicity, 
the 
intellectual 
perviousness, 
of 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
mathematics 
and 
natural 
science 
is 
felt, 
and 
promotes 
both 
the 
discipline 
and 
the 
self-confidence 
of 
the 
reason. 


Unquestionably, 
much 
more 
will 
be 
attained 
by 
instruction 
in 
the 
mathematics 
and 
the 
natural 
sciences 
than 
now 
is, 
when 
more 
natural 
methods 
are 
adopted. 
One 
point 
of 
importance 
here 
is 
that 
young 
students 
should 
not 
be 
spoiled 
by 
premature 
abstraction, 
but 
should 
be 
made 
acquainted 
with 
their 
material 
from 
living 
pictures 
of 
it 
before 
they 
are 
made 
to 
work 
with 
it 
by 
purely 
ratiocinative 
methods. 
A 
good 
stock 
of 
geometrical 
experience 
could 
be 
obtained, 
for 
example, 
from 
geometrical 
drawing 
and 
from 
the 
practical 
construction 
of 
models. 
In 
the 
place 
of 
the 
unfruitful 
method 
of 
Euclid, 
which 
is 
only 
fit 
for 
special, 
restricted 
uses, 
a 
broader 
and 
more 
conscious 
method 
must 
be 
adopted, 
as 
Hankel 
has 
pointed 
out. 
[124] 
Then, 
if, 
on 
reviewing 
geometry, 
and 
after 
it 
presents 
no 
substantial 
difficulties, 
the 
more 
general 
points 
of 
view, 
the 
principles 
of 
scientific 
method 
are 
placed 
in 
relief 
and 
brought 
to 
consciousness, 
as 
Von 
Nagel, 
[125] 


J. 
K. 
Becker, 
[126] 
Mann, 
[127] 
and 
others 
have 
well 
done, 
fruitful 
results 
will 
be 
surely 
attained. 
In 
the 
same 
way, 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
the 
natural 
sciences 
should 
be 
made 
familiar 
by 
pictures 
and 
experiment 
before 
a 
profounder 
and 
reasoned 
grasp 
of 
these 
subjects 
is 
attempted. 
Here 
the 
emphasis 
of 
the 
more 
general 
points 
of 
view 
is 
to 
be 
postponed. 
Before 
my 
present 
audience 
it 
would 
be 
superfluous 
for 
me 
to 
contend 
further 
that 
mathematics 
and 
natural 
science 
are 
justified 
constituents 
of 
a 
sound 
education,—a 
claim 
that 
even 
philologists, 
after 
some 
resistance, 
have 
conceded. 
Here 
I 
may 
count 
upon 
assent 
when 
I 
say 
that 
mathematics 
and 
the 
natural 
sciences 
pursued 
alone 
as 
means 
of 
instruction 
yield 
a 
richer 
education 
in 
matter 
and 
form, 
a 
more 
general 
education, 
an 
education 
better 
adapted 
to 
the 
needs 
and 
spirit 
of 
the 
time,—than 
the 
philological 
branches 
pursued 
alone 
would 
yield. 


But 
how 
shall 
this 
idea 
be 
realised 
in 
the 
curricula 
of 
our 
intermediate 
educational 
institutions? 
It 
is 
unquestionable 
in 
my 
mind 
that 
the 
German 



Realschulen 
and 
Realgymnasien, 
where 
the 
exclusive 
classical 
course 
is 
for 
the 
most 
part 
replaced 
by 
mathematics, 
science, 
and 
modern 
languages, 
give 
the 
average 
man 
a 
more 
timely 
education 
than 
the 
gymnasium 
proper, 
although 
they 
are 
not 
yet 
regarded 
as 
fit 
preparatory 
schools 
for 
future 
theologians 
and 
professional 
philologists. 
The 
German 
gymnasiums 
are 
too 
one-sided. 
With 
these 
the 
first 
changes 
are 
to 
be 
made; 
of 
these 
alone 
we 
shall 
speak 
here. 
Possibly 
a 
single 
preparatory 
school, 
suitably 
planned, 
might 
serve 
all 
purposes. 


Shall 
we, 
then, 
in 
our 
gymnasiums 
fill 
out 
the 
hours 
of 
study 
which 
stand 
at 
our 
disposal, 
or 
are 
still 
to 
be 
wrested 
from 
the 
classicists, 
with 
as 
great 
and 
as 
varied 
a 
quantity 
of 
mathematical 
and 
scientific 
matter 
as 
possible? 
Expect 
no 
such 
proposition 
from 
me. 
No 
one 
will 
suggest 
such 
a 
course 
who 
has 
himself 
been 
actively 
engaged 
in 
scientific 
thought. 
Thoughts 
can 
be 
awakened 
and 
fructified 
as 
a 
field 
is 
fructified 
by 
sunshine 
and 
rain. 
But 
thoughts 
cannot 
be 
juggled 
out 
and 
worried 
out 
by 
heaping 
up 
materials 
and 
the 
hours 
of 
instruction, 
nor 
by 
any 
sort 
of 
precepts: 
they 
must 
grow 
naturally 
of 
their 
own 
free 
accord. 
Furthermore, 
thoughts 
cannot 
be 
accumulated 
beyond 
a 
certain 
limit 
in 
a 
single 
head, 
any 
more 
than 
the 
produce 
of 
a 
field 
can 
be 
increased 
beyond 
certain 
limits. 


I 
believe 
that 
the 
amount 
of 
matter 
necessary 
for 
a 
useful 
education, 
such 
as 
should 
be 
offered 
to 
all 
the 
pupils 
of 
a 
preparatory 
school, 
is 
very 
small. 
If 
I 
had 
the 
requisite 
influence, 
I 
should, 
in 
all 
composure, 
and 
fully 
convinced 
that 
I 
was 
doing 
what 
was 
best, 
first 
greatly 
curtail 
in 
the 
lower 
classes 
the 
amount 
of 
matter 
in 
both 
the 
classical 
and 
the 
scientific 
courses; 
I 
should 
cut 
down 
considerably 
the 
number 
of 
the 
school 
hours 
and 
the 
work 
done 
outside 
the 
school. 
I 
am 
not 
with 
many 
teachers 
of 
opinion 
that 
ten 
hours 
work 
a 
day 
for 
a 
child 
is 
not 
too 
much. 
I 
am 
convinced 
that 
the 
mature 
men 
who 
offer 
this 
advice 
so 
lightly 
are 
themselves 
unable 
to 
give 
their 
attention 
successfully 
for 
as 
long 
a 
time 
to 
any 
subject 
that 
is 
new 
to 
them, 
(for 
example, 
to 
elementary 
mathematics 
or 
physics,) 
and 
I 
would 
ask 
every 
one 
who 
thinks 
the 
contrary 
to 
make 
the 
experiment 
upon 
himself. 
Learning 
and 
teaching 
are 
not 
routine 
office-work 
that 
can 
be 
kept 
up 
mechanically 
for 
long 
periods. 
But 
even 
such 
work 
tires 
in 
the 
end. 
If 
our 
young 
men 
are 
not 
to 
enter 
the 
universities 
with 
blunted 
and 
impoverished 
minds, 
if 
they 
are 
not 
to 
leave 
in 
the 
preparatory 
schools 
their 
vital 
energy, 
which 
they 
should 
there 



gather, 
great 
changes 
must 
be 
made. 
Waiving 
the 
injurious 
effects 
of 
overwork 
upon 
the 
body, 
the 
consequences 
of 
it 
for 
the 
mind 
seem 
to 
me 
positively 
dreadful. 


I 
know 
of 
nothing 
more 
terrible 
than 
the 
poor 
creatures 
who 
have 
learned 
too 
much. 
Instead 
of 
that 
sound 
powerful 
judgment 
which 
would 
probably 
have 
grown 
up 
if 
they 
had 
learned 
nothing, 
their 
thoughts 
creep 
timidly 
and 
hypnotically 
after 
words, 
principles, 
and 
formulæ, 
constantly 
by 
the 
same 
paths. 
What 
they 
have 
acquired 
is 
a 
spider's 
web 
of 
thoughts 
too 
weak 
to 
furnish 
sure 
supports, 
but 
complicated 
enough 
to 
produce 
confusion. 


But 
how 
shall 
better 
methods 
of 
mathematical 
and 
scientific 
education 
be 
combined 
with 
the 
decrease 
of 
the 
subject-matter 
of 
instruction? 
I 
think, 
by 
abandoning 
systematic 
instruction 
altogether, 
at 
least 
in 
so 
far 
as 
that 
is 
required 
of 
all 
young 
pupils. 
I 
see 
no 
necessity 
whatever 
that 
the 
graduates 
of 
our 
high 
schools 
and 
preparatory 
schools 
should 
be 
little 
philologists, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
little 
mathematicians, 
physicists, 
and 
botanists; 
in 
fact, 
I 
do 
not 
see 
the 
possibility 
of 
such 
a 
result. 
I 
see 
in 
the 
endeavor 
to 
attain 
this 
result, 
in 
which 
every 
instructor 
seeks 
for 
his 
own 
branch 
a 
place 
apart 
from 
the 
others, 
the 
main 
mistake 
of 
our 
whole 
system. 
I 
should 
be 
satisfied 
if 
every 
young 
student 
could 
come 
into 
living 
contact 
with 
and 
pursue 
to 
their 
ultimate 
logical 
consequences 
merely 
a 
few 
mathematical 
or 
scientific 
discoveries. 
Such 
instruction 
would 
be 
mainly 
and 
naturally 
associated 
with 
selections 
from 
the 
great 
scientific 
classics. 
A 
few 
powerful 
and 
lucid 
ideas 
could 
thus 
be 
made 
to 
take 
root 
in 
the 
mind 
and 
receive 
thorough 
elaboration. 
This 
accomplished, 
our 
youth 
would 
make 
a 
different 
showing 
from 
what 
they 
do 
to-day. 
[128] 


What 
need 
is 
there, 
for 
example, 
of 
burdening 
the 
head 
of 
a 
young 
student 
with 
all 
the 
details 
of 
botany? 
The 
student 
who 
has 
botanised 
under 
the 
guidance 
of 
a 
teacher 
finds 
on 
all 
hands, 
not 
indifferent 
things, 
but 
known 
or 
unknown 
things, 
by 
which 
he 
is 
stimulated, 
and 
his 
gain 
made 
permanent. 
I 
express 
here, 
not 
my 
own, 
but 
the 
opinion 
of 
a 
friend, 
a 
practical 
teacher. 
Again, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
necessary 
that 
all 
the 
matter 
that 
is 
offered 
in 
the 
schools 
should 
be 
learned. 
The 
best 
that 
we 
have 
learned, 
that 
which 
has 
remained 
with 
us 
for 
life, 
outlived 
the 
test 
of 
examination. 
How 
can 
the 
mind 
thrive 
when 
matter 
is 
heaped 
on 
matter, 
and 
new 
materials 
piled 
constantly 
on 
old, 



undigested 
materials? 
The 
question 
here 
is 
not 
so 
much 
that 
of 
the 
accumulation 
of 
positive 
knowledge 
as 
of 
intellectual 
discipline. 
It 
seems 
also 
unnecessary 
that 
all 
branches 
should 
be 
treated 
at 
school, 
and 
that 
exactly 
the 
same 
studies 
should 
be 
pursued 
in 
all 
schools. 
A 
single 
philological, 
a 
single 
historical, 
a 
single 
mathematical, 
a 
single 
scientific 
branch, 
pursued 
as 
common 
subjects 
of 
instruction 
for 
all 
pupils, 
are 
sufficient 
to 
accomplish 
all 
that 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
intellectual 
development. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
wholesome 
mutual 
stimulus 
would 
be 
produced 
by 
this 
greater 
variety 
in 
the 
positive 
culture 
of 
men. 
Uniforms 
are 
excellent 
for 
soldiers, 
but 
they 
will 
not 
fit 
heads. 
Charles 
V. 
learned 
this, 
and 
it 
should 
never 
be 
forgotten. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
teachers 
and 
pupils 
both 
need 
considerable 
latitude, 
if 
they 
are 
to 
yield 
good 
results. 


With 
John 
Karl 
Becker 
I 
am 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
utility 
and 
amount 
for 
individuals 
of 
every 
study 
should 
be 
precisely 
determined. 
All 
that 
exceeds 
this 
amount 
should 
be 
unconditionally 
banished 
from 
the 
lower 
classes. 
With 
respect 
to 
mathematics, 
Becker, 
[129] 
in 
my 
judgment, 
has 
admirably 
solved 
this 
question. 


With 
respect 
to 
the 
upper 
classes 
the 
demand 
assumes 
a 
different 
form. 
Here 
also 
the 
amount 
of 
matter 
obligatory 
on 
all 
pupils 
ought 
not 
to 
exceed 
a 
certain 
limit. 
But 
in 
the 
great 
mass 
of 
knowledge 
that 
a 
young 
man 
must 
acquire 
to-day 
for 
his 
profession 
it 
is 
no 
longer 
just 
that 
ten 
years 
of 
his 
youth 
should 
be 
wasted 
with 
mere 
preludes. 
The 
upper 
classes 
should 
supply 
a 
truly 
useful 
preparation 
for 
the 
professions, 
and 
should 
not 
be 
modelled 
upon 
the 
wants 
merely 
of 
future 
lawyers, 
ministers, 
and 
philologists. 
Again, 
it 
would 
be 
both 
foolish 
and 
impossible 
to 
attempt 
to 
prepare 
the 
same 
person 
properly 
for 
all 
the 
different 
professions. 
In 
such 
case 
the 
function 
of 
the 
schools 
would 
be, 
as 
Lichtenberg 
feared, 
simply 
to 
select 
the 
persons 
best 
fitted 
for 
being 
drilled, 
whilst 
precisely 
the 
finest 
special 
talents, 
which 
do 
not 
submit 
to 
indiscriminate 
discipline, 
would 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
contest. 
Hence, 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
liberty 
in 
the 
choice 
of 
studies 
must 
be 
introduced 
in 
the 
upper 
classes, 
by 
means 
of 
which 
it 
will 
be 
free 
for 
every 
one 
who 
is 
clear 
about 
the 
choice 
of 
his 
profession 
to 
devote 
his 
chief 
attention 
either 
to 
the 
study 
of 
the 
philologico-historical 
or 
to 
that 
of 
the 
mathematico-scientific 
branches. 
Then 
the 
matter 
now 
treated 
could 
be 
retained, 
and 
in 
some 
branches, 
perhaps, 
judiciously 
extended, 
[130] 
without 
burdening 
the 
scholar 



with 
many 
branches 
or 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
the 
hours 
of 
study. 
With 
more 
homogeneous 
work 
the 
student's 
capacity 
for 
work 
increases, 
one 
part 
of 
his 
labor 
supporting 
the 
other 
instead 
of 
obstructing 
it. 
If, 
however, 
a 
young 
man 
should 
subsequently 
choose 
a 
different 
profession, 
then 
it 
is 
his 
business 
to 
make 
up 
what 
he 
has 
lost. 
No 
harm 
certainly 
will 
come 
to 
society 
from 
this 
change, 
nor 
could 
it 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
misfortune 
if 
philologists 
and 
lawyers 
with 
mathematical 
educations 
or 
physical 
scientists 
with 
classical 
educations 
should 
now 
and 
then 
appear. 


The 
view 
is 
now 
wide-spread 
that 
a 
Latin 
and 
Greek 
education 
no 
longer 
meets 
the 
general 
wants 
of 
the 
times, 
that 
a 
more 
opportune, 
a 
more 
"liberal" 
education 
exists. 
The 
phrase, 
"a 
liberal 
education," 
has 
been 
greatly 
misused. 
A 
truly 
liberal 
education 
is 
unquestionably 
very 
rare. 
The 
schools 
can 
hardly 
offer 
such; 
at 
best 
they 
can 
only 
bring 
home 
to 
the 
student 
the 
necessity 
of 
it. 
It 
is, 
then, 
his 
business 
to 
acquire, 
as 
best 
he 
can, 
a 
more 
or 
less 
liberal 
education. 
It 
would 
be 
very 
difficult, 
too, 
at 
any 
one 
time 
to 
give 
a 
definition 
of 
a 
"liberal" 
education 
which 
would 
satisfy 
every 
one, 
still 
more 
difficult 
to 
give 
one 
which 
would 
hold 
good 
for 
a 
hundred 
years. 
The 
educational 
ideal, 
in 
fact, 
varies 
much. 
To 
one, 
a 
knowledge 
of 
classical 
antiquity 
appears 
not 
too 
dearly 
bought 
"with 
early 
death." 
We 
have 
no 
objection 
to 
this 
person, 
or 
to 
those 
who 
think 
like 
him, 
pursuing 
their 
ideal 
after 
their 
own 
fashion. 
But 
we 
may 
certainly 
protest 
strongly 
against 
the 
realisation 
of 
such 
ideals 
on 
our 
own 
children. 
Another,—Plato, 
for 
example,—puts 
men 
ignorant 
of 
geometry 
on 
a 
level 
with 
animals. 
[131] 
If 
such 
narrow 
views 
had 
the 
magical 
powers 
of 
the 
sorceress 
Circe, 
many 
a 
man 
who 
perhaps 
justly 
thought 
himself 
well 
educated 
would 
become 
conscious 
of 
a 
not 
very 
flattering 
transformation 
of 
himself. 
Let 
us 
seek, 
therefore, 
in 
our 
educational 
system 
to 
meet 
the 
wants 
of 
the 
present, 
and 
not 
establish 
prejudices 
for 
the 
future. 


But 
how 
does 
it 
come, 
we 
must 
ask, 
that 
institutions 
so 
antiquated 
as 
the 
German 
gymnasiums 
could 
subsist 
so 
long 
in 
opposition 
to 
public 
opinion? 
The 
answer 
is 
simple. 
The 
schools 
were 
first 
organised 
by 
the 
Church; 
since 
the 
Reformation 
they 
have 
been 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
State. 
On 
so 
large 
a 
scale, 
the 
plan 
presents 
many 
advantages. 
Means 
can 
be 
placed 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
education 
such 
as 
no 
private 
source, 
at 
least 
in 
Europe, 
could 
furnish. 
Work 
can 
be 
conducted 
upon 
the 
same 
plan 
in 
many 
schools, 
and 
so 
experiments 



made 
of 
extensive 
scope 
which 
would 
be 
otherwise 
impossible. 
A 
single 
man 
with 
influence 
and 
ideas 
can 
under 
such 
circumstances 
do 
great 
things 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
education. 


But 
the 
matter 
has 
also 
its 
reverse 
aspect. 
The 
party 
in 
power 
works 
for 
its 
own 
interests, 
uses 
the 
schools 
for 
its 
special 
purposes. 
Educational 
competition 
is 
excluded, 
for 
all 
successful 
attempts 
at 
improvement 
are 
impossible 
unless 
undertaken 
or 
permitted 
by 
the 
State. 
By 
the 
uniformity 
of 
the 
people's 
education, 
a 
prejudice 
once 
in 
vogue 
is 
permanently 
established. 
The 
highest 
intelligences, 
the 
strongest 
wills 
cannot 
overthrow 
it 
suddenly. 
In 
fact, 
as 
everything 
is 
adapted 
to 
the 
view 
in 
question, 
a 
sudden 
change 
would 
be 
physically 
impossible. 
The 
two 
classes 
which 
virtually 
hold 
the 
reins 
of 
power 
in 
the 
State, 
the 
jurists 
and 
theologians, 
know 
only 
the 
one-sided, 
predominantly 
classical 
culture 
which 
they 
have 
acquired 
in 
the 
State 
schools, 
and 
would 
have 
this 
culture 
alone 
valued. 
Others 
accept 
this 
opinion 
from 
credulity; 
others, 
underestimating 
their 
true 
worth 
for 
society, 
bow 
before 
the 
power 
of 
the 
prevalent 
opinion; 
others, 
again, 
affect 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
ruling 
classes 
even 
against 
their 
better 
judgment, 
so 
as 
to 
abide 
on 
the 
same 
plane 
of 
respect 
with 
the 
latter. 
I 
will 
make 
no 
charges, 
but 
I 
must 
confess 
that 
the 
deportment 
of 
medical 
men 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
question 
of 
the 
qualification 
of 
graduates 
of 
your 
Realschulen 
has 
frequently 
made 
that 
impression 
upon 
me. 
Let 
us 
remember, 
finally, 
that 
an 
influential 
statesman, 
even 
within 
the 
boundaries 
which 
the 
law 
and 
public 
opinion 
set 
him, 
can 
do 
serious 
harm 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
education 
by 
considering 
his 
own 
one-sided 
views 
infallible, 
and 
in 
enforcing 
them 
recklessly 
and 
inconsiderately— 
which 
not 
only 
can 
happen, 
but 
has, 
repeatedly, 
happened. 
[132] 
The 
monopoly 
of 
education 
by 
the 
State 
[133] 
thus 
assumes 
in 
our 
eyes 
a 
somewhat 
different 
aspect. 
And 
to 
revert 
to 
the 
question 
above 
asked, 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
doubt 
that 
the 
German 
gymnasiums 
in 
their 
present 
form 
would 
have 
ceased 
to 
exist 
long 
ago 
if 
the 
State 
had 
not 
supported 
them. 


All 
this 
must 
be 
changed. 
But 
the 
change 
will 
not 
be 
made 
of 
itself, 
nor 
without 
our 
energetic 
interference, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
made 
slowly. 
But 
the 
path 
is 
marked 
out 
for 
us, 
the 
will 
of 
the 
people 
must 
acquire 
and 
exert 
upon 
our 
school 
legislation 
a 
greater 
and 
more 
powerful 
influence. 
Furthermore, 
the 
questions 
at 
issue 
must 
be 
publicly 
and 
candidly 
discussed 
that 
the 
views 
of 
the 
people 
may 
be 
clarified. 
All 
who 
feel 
the 
insufficiency 
of 
the 
existing 



régime 
must 
combine 
into 
a 
powerful 
organisation 
that 
their 
views 
may 
acquire 
impressiveness 
and 
the 
opinions 
of 
the 
individual 
not 
die 
away 
unheard. 


I 
recently 
read, 
gentlemen, 
in 
an 
excellent 
book 
of 
travels, 
that 
the 
Chinese 
speak 
with 
unwillingness 
of 
politics. 
Conversations 
of 
this 
sort 
are 
usually 
cut 
short 
with 
the 
remark 
that 
they 
may 
bother 
about 
such 
things 
whose 
business 
it 
is 
and 
who 
are 
paid 
for 
it. 
Now 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
it 
is 
not 
only 
the 
business 
of 
the 
State, 
but 
a 
very 
serious 
concern 
of 
all 
of 
us, 
how 
our 
children 
shall 
be 
educated 
in 
the 
public 
schools 
at 
our 
cost. 



APPENDIX. 


I. 


A 
CONTRIBUTION 
TO 
THE 
HISTORY 
OF 
ACOUSTICS. 


[134] 


While 
searching 
for 
papers 
by 
Amontons, 
several 
volumes 
of 
the 
Memoirs 
of 
the 
Paris 
Academy 
for 
the 
first 
years 
of 
the 
eighteenth 
century, 
fell 
into 
my 
hands. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
portray 
the 
delight 
which 
one 
experiences 
in 
running 
over 
the 
leaves 
of 
these 
volumes. 
One 
sees 
as 
an 
actual 
spectator 
almost 
the 
rise 
of 
the 
most 
important 
discoveries 
and 
witnesses 
the 
progress 
of 
many 
fields 
of 
knowledge 
from 
almost 
total 
ignorance 
to 
relatively 
perfect 
clearness. 


I 
propose 
to 
discuss 
here 
the 
fundamental 
researches 
of 
Sauveur 
in 
Acoustics. 
It 
is 
astonishing 
how 
extraordinarily 
near 
Sauveur 
was 
to 
the 
view 
which 
Helmholtz 
was 
the 
first 
to 
adopt 
in 
its 
full 
extent 
a 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
years 
later. 


The 
Histoire 
de 
l'Académie 
for 
1700, 
p. 
131, 
tells 
us 
that 
Sauveur 
had 
succeeded 
in 
making 
music 
an 
object 
of 
scientific 
research, 
and 
that 
he 
had 
invested 
the 
new 
science 
with 
the 
name 
of 
"acoustics." 
On 
five 
successive 
pages 
a 
number 
of 
discoveries 
are 
recorded 
which 
are 
more 
fully 
discussed 
in 
the 
volume 
for 
the 
year 
following. 


Sauveur 
regards 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
ratios 
obtaining 
between 
the 
rates 
of 
vibration 
of 
consonances 
as 
something 
universally 
known. 
[135] 
He 
is 
in 
hope, 
by 
further 
research, 
of 
determining 
the 
chief 
rules 
of 
musical 
composition 
and 
of 
fathoming 
the 
"metaphysics 
of 
the 
agreeable," 
the 
main 
law 
of 
which 
he 
asserts 
to 
be 
the 
union 
of 
"simplicity 
with 
multiplicity." 
Precisely 
as 
Euler 


[136] 
did 
a 
number 
of 
years 
later, 
he 
regards 
a 
consonance 
as 
more 
perfect 
according 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
its 
vibrational 
rates 
is 
expressed 
in 
smaller 
whole 
numbers, 
because 
the 
smaller 
these 
whole 
numbers 
are 
the 
oftener 
the 

vibrations 
of 
the 
two 
tones 
coincide, 
and 
hence 
the 
more 
readily 
they 
are 
apprehended. 
As 
the 
limit 
of 
consonance, 
he 
takes 
the 
ratio 
5:6, 
although 
he 
does 
not 
conceal 
the 
fact 
that 
practice, 
sharpened 
attention, 
habit, 
taste, 
and 
even 
prejudice 
play 
collateral 
rôles 
in 
the 
matter, 
and 
that 
consequently 
the 
question 
is 
not 
a 
purely 
scientific 
one. 


Sauveur's 
ideas 
took 
their 
development 
from 
his 
having 
instituted 
at 
all 
points 
more 
exact 
quantitative 
investigations 
than 
his 
predecessors. 
He 
is 
first 
desirous 
of 
determining 
as 
the 
foundation 
of 
musical 
tuning 
a 
fixed 
note 
of 
one 
hundred 
vibrations 
which 
can 
be 
reproduced 
at 
any 
time; 
the 
fixing 
of 
the 
notes 
of 
musical 
instruments 
by 
the 
common 
tuning 
pipes 
then 
in 
use 
with 
rates 
of 
vibration 
unknown, 
appearing 
to 
him 
inadequate. 
According 
to 
Mersenne 
(Harmonie 
Universelle, 
1636), 
a 
given 
cord 
seventeen 
feet 
long 
and 
weighted 
with 
eight 
pounds 
executes 
eight 
visible 
vibrations 
in 
a 
second. 
By 
diminishing 
its 
length 
then 
in 
a 
given 
proportion 
we 
obtain 
a 
proportionately 
augmented 
rate 
of 
vibration. 
But 
this 
procedure 
appears 
too 
uncertain 
to 
Sauveur, 
and 
he 
employs 
for 
his 
purpose 
the 
beats 
(battemens), 
which 
were 
known 
to 
the 
organ-makers 
of 
his 
day, 
and 
which 
he 
correctly 
explains 
as 
due 
to 
the 
alternate 
coincidence 
and 
non-coincidence 
of 
the 
same 
vibrational 
phases 
of 
differently 
pitched 
notes. 
[137] 
At 
every 
coincidence 
there 
is 
a 
swelling 
of 
the 
sound, 
and 
hence 
the 
number 
of 
beats 
per 
second 
will 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
rates 
of 
vibration. 
If 
we 
tune 
two 
of 
three 
organ-pipes 
to 
the 
remaining 
one 
in 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
minor 
and 
major 
third, 
the 
mutual 
ratio 
of 
the 
rates 
of 
vibration 
of 
the 
first 
two 
will 
be 
as 
24: 
25, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
for 
every 
24 
vibrations 
to 
the 
lower 
note 
there 
will 
be 
25 
to 
the 
higher, 
and 
one 
beat. 
If 
the 
two 
pipes 
give 
together 
four 
beats 
in 
a 
second, 
then 
the 
higher 
has 
the 
fixed 
tone 
of 
100 
vibrations. 
The 
open 
pipe 
in 
question 
will 
consequently 
be 
five 
feet 
in 
length. 
We 
also 
determine 
by 
this 
procedure 
the 
absolute 
rates 
of 
vibration 
of 
all 
the 
other 
notes. 


It 
follows 
at 
once 
that 
a 
pipe 
eight 
times 
as 
long 
or 
40 
feet 
in 
length 
will 
yield 
a 
vibrational 
rate 
of 
12-1/2, 
which 
Sauveur 
ascribes 
to 
the 
lowest 
audible 
tone, 
and 
further 
also 
that 
a 
pipe 
64 
times 
as 
small 
will 
execute 
6,400 
vibrations, 
which 
Sauveur 
took 
for 
the 
highest 
audible 
limit. 
The 
author's 
delight 
at 
his 
successful 
enumeration 
of 
the 
"imperceptible 
vibrations" 
is 
unmistakably 
asserted 
here, 
and 
it 
is 
justified 
when 
we 
reflect 
that 
to-day 
even 
Sauveur's 
principle, 
slightly 
modified, 
constitutes 
the 
simplest 
and 
most 



delicate 
means 
we 
have 
for 
exactly 
determining 
rates 
of 
vibration. 
Far 
more 
important 
still, 
however, 
is 
a 
second 
observation 
which 
Sauveur 
made 
while 
studying 
beats, 
and 
to 
which 
we 
shall 
revert 
later. 


Strings 
whose 
lengths 
can 
be 
altered 
by 
movable 
bridges 
are 
much 
easier 
to 
handle 
than 
pipes 
in 
such 
investigations, 
and 
it 
was 
natural 
that 
Sauveur 
should 
soon 
resort 
to 
their 
use. 


One 
of 
his 
bridges 
accidentally 
not 
having 
been 
brought 
into 
full 
and 
hard 
contact 
with 
the 
string, 
and 
consequently 
only 
imperfectly 
impeding 
the 
vibrations, 
Sauveur 
discovered 
the 
harmonic 
overtones 
of 
the 
string, 
at 
first 
by 
the 
unaided 
ear, 
and 
concluded 
from 
this 
fact 
that 
the 
string 
was 
divided 
into 
aliquot 
parts. 
The 
string 
when 
plucked, 
and 
when 
the 
bridge 
stood 
at 
the 
third 
division 
for 
example, 
yielded 
the 
twelfth 
of 
its 
fundamental 
note. 
At 
the 
suggestion 
of 
some 
academician 
[138] 
probably, 
variously 
colored 
paper 
riders 
were 
placed 
at 
the 
nodes 
(noeuds) 
and 
ventral 
segments 
(ventres), 
and 
the 
division 
of 
the 
string 
due 
to 
the 
excitation 
of 
the 
overtones 
(sons 
harmoniques) 
belonging 
to 
its 
fundamental 
note 
(son 
fondamental) 
thus 
rendered 
visible. 
For 
the 
clumsy 
bridge 
the 
more 
convenient 
feather 
or 
brush 
was 
soon 
substituted. 
. 
While 
engaged 
in 
these 
investigations 
Sauveur 
also 
observed 
the 
sympathetic 
vibration 
of 
a 
string 
induced 
by 
the 
excitation 
of 
a 
second 
one 
in 
unison 
with 
it. 
He 
also 
discovered 
that 
the 
overtone 
of 
a 
string 
can 
respond 
to 
another 
string 
tuned 
to 
its 
note. 
He 
even 
went 
further 
and 
discovered 
that 
on 
exciting 
one 
string 
the 
overtone 
which 
it 
has 
in 
common 
with 
another, 
differently 
pitched 
string 
can 
be 
produced 
on 
that 
other; 
for 
example, 
on 
strings 
having 
for 
their 
vibrational 
ratio 
3:4, 
the 
fourth 
of 
the 
lower 
and 
the 
third 
of 
the 
higher 
may 
be 
made 
to 
respond. 
It 
follows 
indisputably 
from 
this 
that 
the 
excited 
string 
yields 
overtones 
simultaneously 
with 
its 
fundamental 
tone. 
Previously 
to 
this 
Sauveur's 
attention 
had 
been 
drawn 
by 
other 
observers 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
overtones 
of 
musical 
instruments 
can 
be 
picked 
out 
by 
attentive 
listening, 
particularly 
in 
the 
night. 
[139] 
He 
himself 
mentions 
the 
simultaneous 
sounding 
of 
the 
overtones 
and 
the 
fundamental 
tone. 
[140] 
That 
he 
did 
not 
give 
the 
proper 
consideration 
to 
this 
circumstance 
was, 
as 
will 
afterwards 
be 
seen, 
fatal 
to 
his 
theory. 


While 
studying 
beats 
Sauveur 
makes 
the 
remark 
that 
they 
are 
displeasing 
to 
the 
ear. 
He 
held 
the 
beats 
were 
distinctly 
audible 
only 
when 
less 
than 
six 



occurred 
in 
a 
second. 
Larger 
numbers 
were 
not 
distinctly 
perceptible 
and 
gave 
rise 
accordingly 
to 
no 
disturbance. 
He 
then 
attempts 
to 
reduce 
the 
difference 
between 
consonance 
and 
dissonance 
to 
a 
question 
of 
beats. 
Let 
us 
hear 
his 
own 
words. 
[141] 


"Beats 
are 
unpleasing 
to 
the 
ear 
because 
of 
the 
unevenness 
of 
the 
sound, 
and 
it 
may 
be 
held 
with 
much 
plausibility 
that 
the 
reason 
why 
octaves 
are 
so 
pleasing 
is 
that 
we 
never 
hear 
their 
beats. 
[142] 


"In 
following 
out 
this 
idea, 
we 
find 
that 
the 
chords 
whose 
beats 
we 
cannot 
hear 
are 
precisely 
those 
which 
the 
musicians 
call 
consonances 
and 
that 
those 
whose 
beats 
are 
heard 
are 
the 
dissonances, 
and 
that 
when 
a 
chord 
is 
a 
dissonance 
in 
one 
octave 
and 
a 
consonance 
in 
another, 
it 
beats 
in 
the 
one 
and 
does 
not 
beat 
in 
the 
other. 
Consequently 
it 
is 
called 
an 
imperfect 
consonance. 
It 
is 
very 
easy 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
M. 
Sauveur, 
here 
established, 
to 
ascertain 
what 
chords 
beat 
and 
in 
what 
octaves, 
above 
or 
below 
the 
fixed 
note. 
If 
this 
hypothesis 
be 
correct, 
it 
will 
disclose 
the 
true 
source 
of 
the 
rules 
of 
composition, 
hitherto 
unknown 
to 
science, 
and 
given 
over 
almost 
entirely 
to 
judgment 
by 
the 
ear. 
These 
sorts 
of 
natural 
judgment, 
marvellous 
though 
they 
may 
sometimes 
appear, 
are 
not 
so 
but 
have 
very 
real 
causes, 
the 
knowledge 
of 
which 
belongs 
to 
science, 
provided 
it 
can 
gain 
possession 
thereof." 
[143] 


Sauveur 
thus 
correctly 
discerns 
in 
beats 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
disturbance 
of 
consonance, 
to 
which 
all 
disharmony 
is 
"probably" 
to 
be 
referred. 
It 
will 
be 
seen, 
however, 
that 
according 
to 
his 
view 
all 
distant 
intervals 
must 
necessarily 
be 
consonances 
and 
all 
near 
intervals 
dissonances. 
He 
also 
overlooks 
the 
absolute 
difference 
in 
point 
of 
principle 
between 
his 
old 
view, 
mentioned 
at 
the 
outset, 
and 
his 
new 
view, 
rather 
attempting 
to 
obliterate 
it. 


R. 
Smith 
[144] 
takes 
note 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
Sauveur 
and 
calls 
attention 
to 
the 
first 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
defects. 
Being 
himself 
essentially 
involved 
in 
the 
old 
view 
of 
Sauveur, 
which 
is 
usually 
attributed 
to 
Euler, 
he 
yet 
approaches 
in 
his 
criticism 
a 
brief 
step 
nearer 
to 
the 
modern 
theory, 
as 
appears 
from 
the 
following 
passage. 
[145] 
"The 
truth 
is, 
this 
gentleman 
confounds 
the 
distinction 
between 
perfect 



and 
imperfect 
consonances, 
by 
comparing 
imperfect 
consonances 
which 
beat 
because 
the 
succession 
of 
their 
short 
cycles 
[146] 
is 
periodically 
confused 
and 
interrupted, 
with 
perfect 
ones 
which 
cannot 
beat, 
because 
the 
succession 
of 
their 
short 
cycles 
is 
never 
confused 
nor 
interrupted. 


"The 
fluttering 
roughness 
above 
mentioned 
is 
perceivable 
in 
all 
other 
perfect 
consonances, 
in 
a 
smaller 
degree 
in 
proportion 
as 
their 
cycles 
are 
shorter 
and 
simpler, 
and 
their 
pitch 
is 
higher; 
and 
is 
of 
a 
different 
kind 
from 
the 
smoother 
beats 
and 
undulations 
of 
tempered 
consonances; 
because 
we 
can 
alter 
the 
rate 
of 
the 
latter 
by 
altering 
the 
temperament, 
but 
not 
of 
the 
former, 
the 
consonance 
being 
perfect 
at 
a 
given 
pitch: 
And 
because 
a 
judicious 
ear 
can 
often 
hear, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
both 
the 
flutterings 
and 
the 
beats 
of 
a 
tempered 
consonance; 
sufficiently 
distinct 
from 
each 
other. 


"For 
nothing 
gives 
greater 
offence 
to 
the 
hearer, 
though 
ignorant 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
it, 
than 
those 
rapid, 
piercing 
beats 
of 
high 
and 
loud 
sounds, 
which 
make 
imperfect 
consonances 
with 
one 
another. 
And 
yet 
a 
few 
slow 
beats, 
like 
the 
slow 
undulations 
of 
a 
close 
shake 
now 
and 
then 
introduced, 
are 
far 
from 
being 
disagreeable." 


Smith 
is 
accordingly 
clear 
that 
other 
"roughnesses" 
exist 
besides 
the 
beats 
which 
Sauveur 
considered, 
and 
if 
the 
investigations 
had 
been 
continued 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Sauveur's 
idea, 
these 
additional 
roughnesses 
would 
have 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
the 
beats 
of 
the 
overtones, 
and 
the 
theory 
thus 
have 
attained 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
Helmholtz. 


Reviewing 
the 
differences 
between 
Sauveur's 
and 
Helmholtz's 
theories, 
we 
find 
the 
following: 


1. 
The 
theory 
according 
to 
which 
consonance 
depends 
on 
the 
frequent 
and 
regular 
coincidence 
of 
vibrations 
and 
their 
ease 
of 
enumeration, 
appears 
from 
the 
new 
point 
of 
view 
inadmissible. 
The 
simplicity 
of 
the 
ratios 
obtaining 
between 
the 
rates 
of 
vibration 
is 
indeed 
a 
mathematical 
characteristic 
of 
consonance 
as 
well 
as 
a 
physical 
condition 
thereof, 
for 
the 
reason 
that 
the 
coincidence 
of 
the 
overtones 
as 
also 
their 
further 
physical 
and 
physiological 
consequences 
is 
connected 
with 
this 
fact. 
But 
no 
physiological 
or 
psychological 
explanation 
of 
consonance 
is 
given 
by 
this 
fact, 
for 
the 
simple 

reason 
that 
in 
the 
acoustic 
nerve-process 
nothing 
corresponding 
to 
the 
periodicity 
of 
the 
sonant 
stimulus 
is 
discoverable. 


2. 
In 
the 
recognition 
of 
beats 
as 
a 
disturbance 
of 
consonance, 
both 
theories 
agree. 
Sauveur's 
theory, 
however, 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
fact 
that 
clangs, 
or 
musical 
sounds 
generally, 
are 
composite 
and 
that 
the 
disturbance 
in 
the 
consonances 
of 
distant 
intervals 
principally 
arise 
from 
the 
beats 
of 
the 
overtones. 
Furthermore, 
Sauveur 
was 
wrong 
in 
asserting 
that 
the 
number 
of 
beats 
must 
be 
less 
than 
six 
in 
a 
second 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
disturbances. 
Even 
Smith 
knows 
that 
very 
slow 
beats 
are 
not 
a 
cause 
of 
disturbance, 
and 
Helmholtz 
found 
a 
much 
higher 
number 
(33) 
for 
the 
maximum 
of 
disturbance. 
Finally, 
Sauveur 
did 
not 
consider 
that 
although 
the 
number 
of 
beats 
increases 
with 
the 
recession 
from 
unison, 
yet 
their 
strength 
is 
diminished. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
specific 
energies 
and 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
sympathetic 
vibration 
the 
new 
theory 
finds 
that 
two 
atmospheric 
motions 
of 
like 
amplitude 
but 
different 
periods, 
a 
sin(rt) 
and 
a 
sin[(r 
+ 
ρ)(t 
+ 
τ)], 
cannot 
be 
communicated 
with 
the 
same 
amplitude 
to 
the 
same 
nervous 
end-
organ. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
an 
end-organ 
that 
reacts 
best 
to 
the 
period 
r 
responds 
more 
weakly 
to 
the 
period 
r 
+ 
ρ, 
the 
two 
amplitudes 
bearing 
to 
each 
other 
the 
proportion 
a:φa. 
Here 
φ 
decreases 
when 
ρ 
increases, 
and 
when 
ρ 
= 
0 
it 
becomes 
equal 
to 
1, 
so 
that 
only 
the 
portion 
of 
the 
stimulus 
φa 
is 
subject 
to 
beats, 
and 
the 
portion 
(1-φ)a 
continues 
smoothly 
onward 
without 
disturbance. 
If 
there 
is 
any 
moral 
to 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
history 
of 
this 
theory, 
it 
is 
that 
considering 
how 
near 
Sauveur's 
errors 
were 
to 
the 
truth, 
it 
behooves 
us 
to 
exercise 
some 
caution 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
new 
theory. 
And 
in 
reality 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
reason 
for 
doing 
so. 


The 
fact 
that 
a 
musician 
will 
never 
confound 
a 
more 
perfectly 
consonant 
chord 
on 
a 
poorly 
tuned 
piano 
with 
a 
less 
perfectly 
consonant 
chord 
on 
a 
well 
tuned 
piano, 
although 
the 
roughness 
in 
the 
two 
cases 
may 
be 
the 
same, 
is 
sufficient 
indication 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
roughness 
is 
not 
the 
only 
characteristic 
of 
a 
harmony. 
As 
the 
musician 
knows, 
even 
the 
harmonic 
beauties 
of 
a 
Beethoven 
sonata 
are 
not 
easily 
effaced 
on 
a 
poorly 
tuned 
piano; 
they 
scarcely 
suffer 
more 
than 
a 
Raphael 
drawing 
executed 
in 
rough 
unfinished 
strokes. 
The 
positive 
physiologico-psychological 
characteristic 
which 
distinguishes 
one 
harmony 
from 
another 
is 
not 
given 
by 
the 
beats. 
Nor 
is 
this 



characteristic 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
fact 
that, 
for 
example, 
in 
sounding 
a 
major 
third 
the 
fifth 
partial 
tone 
of 
the 
lower 
note 
coincides 
with 
the 
fourth 
of 
the 
higher 
note. 
This 
characteristic 
comes 
into 
consideration 
only 
for 
the 
investigating 
and 
abstracting 
reason. 
If 
we 
should 
regard 
it 
also 
as 
characteristic 
of 
the 
sensation, 
we 
should 
lapse 
into 
a 
fundamental 
error 
which 
would 
be 
quite 
analogous 
to 
that 
cited 
in 
(1). 


The 
positive 
physiological 
characteristics 
of 
the 
intervals 
would 
doubtless 
be 
speedily 
revealed 
if 
it 
were 
possible 
to 
conduct 
aperiodic, 
for 
example 
galvanic, 
stimuli 
to 
the 
single 
sound-sensing 
organs, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
beats 
would 
be 
totally 
eliminated. 
Unfortunately 
such 
an 
experiment 
can 
hardly 
be 
regarded 
as 
practicable. 
The 
employment 
of 
acoustic 
stimuli 
of 
short 
duration 
and 
consequently 
also 
free 
from 
beats, 
involves 
the 
additional 
difficulty 
of 
a 
pitch 
not 
precisely 
determinable. 


II. 


REMARKS 
ON 
THE 
THEORY 
OF 
SPATIAL 
VISION. 
[147] 


According 
to 
Herbart, 
spatial 
vision 
rests 
on 
reproduction-series. 
In 
such 
an 
event, 
of 
course, 
and 
if 
the 
supposition 
is 
correct, 
the 
magnitudes 
of 
the 
residua 
with 
which 
the 
percepts 
or 
representations 
are 
coalesced 
(the 
helps 
to 
coalescence) 
are 
of 
cardinal 
influence. 
Furthermore, 
since 
the 
coalescences 
must 
first 
be 
fully 
perfected 
before 
they 
make 
their 
appearance, 
and 
since 
upon 
their 
appearance 
the 
inhibitory 
ratios 
are 
brought 
into 
play, 
ultimately, 
then, 
if 
we 
leave 
out 
of 
account 
the 
accidental 
order 
of 
time 
in 
which 
the 
percepts 
are 
given, 
everything 
in 
spatial 
vision 
depends 
on 
the 
oppositions 
and 
affinities, 
or, 
in 
brief, 
on 
the 
qualities 
of 
the 
percepts, 
which 
enter 
into 
series. 


Let 
us 
see 
how 
the 
theory 
stands 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
special 
facts 
involved. 


1. 
If 
intersecting 
series 
only, 
running 
anteriorly 
and 
posteriorly, 
are 
requisite 
for 
the 
production 
of 
spatial 
sensation, 
why 
are 
not 
analogues 
of 
them 
found 
in 
all 
the 
senses? 

2. 
Why 
do 
we 
measure 
differently 
colored 
objects 
and 
variegated 
objects 
with 
one 
and 
the 
same 
spatial 
measure? 
How 
do 
we 
recognise 
differently 
colored 
objects 
as 
the 
same 
in 
size? 
Where 
do 
we 
get 
our 
measure 
of 
space 
from 
and 
what 
is 
it? 
3. 
Why 
is 
it 
that 
differently 
colored 
figures 
of 
the 
same 
form 
reproduce 
one 
another 
and 
are 
recognised 
as 
the 
same? 
Here 
are 
difficulties 
enough. 
Herbart 
is 
unable 
to 
solve 
them 
by 
his 
theory. 
The 
unprejudiced 
student 
sees 
at 
once 
that 
his 
"inhibition 
by 
reason 
of 
form" 
and 
"preference 
by 
reason 
of 
form" 
are 
absolutely 
impossible. 
Think 
of 
Herbart's 
example 
of 
the 
red 
and 
black 
letters. 


The 
"help 
to 
coalescence" 
is 
a 
passport, 
so 
to 
speak, 
made 
out 
to 
the 
name 
and 
person 
of 
the 
percept. 
A 
percept 
which 
is 
coalesced 
with 
another 
cannot 
reproduce 
all 
others 
qualitatively 
different 
from 
it 
for 
the 
simple 
reason 
that 
the 
latter 
are 
in 
like 
manner 
coalesced 
with 
one 
another. 
Two 
qualitatively 
different 
series 
certainly 
do 
not 
reproduce 
themselves 
because 
they 
present 
the 
same 
order 
of 
degree 
of 
coalescence. 


If 
it 
is 
certain 
that 
only 
things 
simultaneous 
and 
things 
which 
are 
alike 
are 
reproduced, 
a 
basic 
principle 
of 
Herbart's 
psychology 
which 
even 
the 
most 
absolute 
empiricists 
will 
not 
deny, 
nothing 
remains 
but 
to 
modify 
the 
theory 
of 
spatial 
perception 
or 
to 
invent 
in 
its 
place 
a 
new 
principle 
in 
the 
manner 
indicated, 
a 
step 
which 
hardly 
any 
one 
would 
seriously 
undertake. 
The 
new 
principle 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
throw 
all 
psychology 
into 
the 
most 
dreadful 
confusion. 


As 
to 
the 
modification 
which 
is 
needed 
there 
can 
be 
hardly 
any 
doubt 
as 
to 
how 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
facts 
and 
conformably 
to 
Herbart's 
own 
principles 
it 
is 
to 
be 
carried 
out. 
If 
two 
differently 
colored 
figures 
of 
equal 
size 
reproduce 
each 
other 
and 
are 
recognised 
as 
equal, 
the 
result 
can 
be 
due 
to 
nothing 
but 
to 
the 
existence 
in 
both 
series 
of 
presentations 
of 
a 
presentation 
or 
percept 
which 
is 
qualitatively 
the 
same. 
The 
colors 
are 
different. 
Consequently, 
like 
or 
equal 
percepts 
must 
be 
connected 
with 
the 
colors 
which 
are 
yet 
independent 
of 
the 
colors. 
We 
have 
not 
to 
look 
long 
for 
them, 
for 
they 
are 
the 
like 
effects 
of 
the 
muscular 
feelings 
of 
the 
eye 
when 
confronted 
by 
the 
two 
figures. 
We 
might 
say 
we 
reach 
the 
vision 
of 
space 
by 
the 
registering 
of 
light



sensations 
in 
a 
schedule 
of 
graduated 
muscle-sensations. 
[148] 


A 
few 
considerations 
will 
show 
the 
likelihood 
of 
the 
rôle 
of 
the 
muscle-
sensations. 
The 
muscular 
apparatus 
of 
one 
eye 
is 
unsymmetrical. 
The 
two 
eyes 
together 
form 
a 
system 
which 
is 
vertical 
in 
symmetry. 
This 
already 
explains 
much. 


1. 
The 
position 
of 
a 
figure 
influences 
its 
view. 
According 
to 
the 
position 
in 
which 
objects 
are 
viewed 
different 
muscle-sensations 
come 
into 
play 
and 
the 
impression 
is 
altered. 
To 
recognise 
inverted 
letters 
as 
such 
long 
experience 
is 
required. 
The 
best 
proof 
of 
this 
are 
the 
letters 
d, 
b, 
p, 
q, 
which 
are 
represented 
by 
the 
same 
figure 
in 
different 
positions 
and 
yet 
are 
always 
distinguished 
as 
different. 
[149] 
2. 
It 
will 
not 
escape 
the 
attentive 
observer 
that 
for 
the 
same 
reasons 
and 
even 
with 
the 
same 
figure 
and 
in 
the 
same 
position 
the 
fixation 
point 
is 
also 
decisive. 
The 
figure 
seems 
to 
change 
during 
the 
act 
of 
vision. 
For 
example, 
an 
eight-pointed 
star 
constructed 
by 
successively 
joining 
in 
a 
regular 
octagon 
the 
first 
corner 
with 
the 
fourth, 
the 
fourth 
with 
the 
seventh, 
etc., 
skipping 
in 
every 
case 
two 
corners, 
assumes 
alternately, 
according 
to 
where 
we 
suffer 
the 
centre 
of 
vision 
to 
rest, 
a 
predominantly 
architectonic 
or 
a 
freer 
and 
more 
open 
character. 
Vertical 
and 
horizontal 
lines 
are 
always 
differently 
apprehended 
from 
what 
oblique 
lines 
are. 
3. 
The 
reason 
why 
we 
prefer 
vertical 
symmetry 
and 
regard 
it 
as 
something 
special 
in 
its 
kind, 
whereas 
we 
do 
not 
recognise 
horizontal 
symmetry 
at 
all 
immediately, 
is 
due 
to 
the 
vertical 
symmetry 
of 
the 
muscular 
apparatus 
of 
the 
eye. 
The 
left-hand 
side 
a 
of 
the 
accompanying 
vertically-symmetrical 
figure 
induces 
in 
the 
left 
eye 
the 
same 
muscular 
feelings 
as 
the 
right-hand 
side 
b 
does 
in 
the 
right 
eye. 
The 
pleasing 
effect 
of 
symmetry 
has 
its 
cause 
primarily 
in 
the 
repetition 
of 
muscular 
feelings. 
That 
a 
repetition 
actually 
occurs 
here, 
sometimes 
sufficiently 
marked 
in 
character 
as 
to 
lead 
to 
the 
confounding 
of 
objects, 
is 
proved 
apart 
from 
the 
theory 
by 
the 
fact 
which 
is 
familiar 
to 
every 
one 
quem 
dii 
oderunt 
that 
children 
frequently 
reverse 
figures 
from 
the 
right 
to 
the 
left, 
but 
never 
from 
above 
downwards; 
for 
example, 
write 
ε 
instead 
of 
3 
until 
they 
finally 
come 
to 
notice 
the 
slight 
difference. 
Figure 
50 
shows 
how 
pleasing 
the 
repetition 
of 
muscular 
feelings 
may 
be. 
As 
will 
be 
readily 

understood, 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
lines 
exhibit 
relations 
similar 
to 
symmetrical 
figures 
which 
are 
immediately 
disturbed 
when 
oblique 
positions 
are 
chosen 
for 
the 
lines. 
Compare 
what 
Helmholtz 
says 
regarding 
the 
repetition 
and 
coincidence 
of 
partial 
tones. 


I 
may 
be 
permitted 
to 
add 
a 
general 
remark. 
It 
is 
a 
quite 
universal 
phenomenon 
in 
psychology 
that 
certain 
qualitatively 
quite 
different 
series 
of 
percepts 
mutually 
awaken 
and 
reproduce 
one 
another 
and 
in 
a 
certain 
aspect 
produce 
the 
appearance 
of 
sameness 
or 
similarity. 
We 
say 
of 
such 
series 
that 
they 
are 
of 
like 
or 
of 
similar 
form, 
naming 
their 
abstracted 
likeness 
form. 


1. 
Of 
spatial 
figures 
we 
have 
already 
spoken. 
2. 
We 
call 
two 
melodies 
like 
melodies 
when 
they 
present 
the 
same 
succession 
of 
pitch-ratios; 
the 
absolute 
pitch 
(or 
key) 
may 
be 
as 
different 
as 
can 
be. 
We 
can 
so 
select 
the 
melodies 
that 
not 
even 
two 
partial 
tones 
of 
the 
notes 
in 
each 
are 
common. 
Yet 
we 
recognise 
the 
melodies 
as 
alike. 
And, 
what 
is 
more, 
we 
notice 
the 
form 
of 
the 
melody 
more 
readily 
and 
recognise 
it 
again 
more 
easily 
than 
the 
key 
(the 
absolute 
pitch) 
in 
which 
it 
was 
played. 
3. 
We 
recognise 
in 
two 
different 
melodies 
the 
same 
rhythm 
no 
matter 
how 
different 
the 
melodies 
may 
be 
otherwise. 
We 
know 
and 
recognise 
the 
rhythm 
more 
easily 
even 
than 
the 
absolute 
duration 
(the 
tempo). 
These 
examples 
will 
suffice. 
In 
all 
these 
and 
in 
all 
similar 
cases 
the 
recognition 
and 
likeness 
cannot 
depend 
upon 
the 
qualities 
of 
the 
percepts, 
for 
these 
are 
different. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
recognition, 
conformably 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
psychology, 
is 
possible 
only 
with 
percepts 
which 
are 
the 
same 
in 
quality. 
Consequently 
there 
is 
no 
other 
escape 
than 
to 
imagine 
the 
qualitatively 
unlike 
percepts 
of 
the 
two 
series 
as 
necessarily 
connected 
with 
other 
percepts 
which 
are 
qualitatively 
alike. 


Since 
in 
differently 
colored 
figures 
of 
like 
form, 
like 
muscular 
feelings 
are 
necessarily 
induced 
if 
the 
figures 
are 
recognised 
as 
alike, 
so 
there 
must 
necessarily 
lie 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
forms 
also, 
and 
we 
might 
even 
say 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
all 
abstractions, 
percepts 
of 
a 
peculiar 
quality. 
And 
this 
holds 
true 
for 
space 
and 
form 
as 
well 
as 
for 
time, 
rhythm, 
pitch, 
the 
form 
of 
melodies, 



intensity, 
etc. 
But 
whence 
is 
psychology 
to 
derive 
all 
these 
qualities? 
Have 
no 
fear, 
they 
will 
all 
be 
found, 
as 
were 
the 
sensations 
of 
muscles 
for 
the 
theory 
of 
space. 
The 
organism 
is 
at 
present 
still 
rich 
enough 
to 
meet 
all 
the 
requirements 
of 
psychology 
in 
this 
direction, 
and 
it 
is 
even 
time 
to 
give 
serious 
ear 
to 
the 
question 
of 
"corporeal 
resonance" 
which 
psychology 
so 
loves 
to 
dwell 
on. 


Different 
psychical 
qualities 
appear 
to 
bear 
a 
very 
intimate 
mutual 
relation 
to 
one 
another. 
Special 
research 
on 
the 
subject, 
as 
well 
also 
as 
the 
demonstration 
that 
this 
remark 
may 
be 
generally 
employed 
in 
physics, 
will 
follow 
later.

"The 
appearance 
of 
a 
translation 
into 
English 
of 
this 
remarkable 
book 
should 
serve 
to 
revivify 
in 
this 
country 
[England] 
the 
somewhat 
stagnating 
treatment 
of 
its 
subject, 
and 
should 
call 
up 
the 
thoughts 
which 
puzzle 
us 
when 
we 
think 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
often.... 
Professor 
Mach 
is 
a 
striking 
instance 
of 
the 
combination 
of 
great 
mathematical 
knowledge 
with 
experimental 
skill, 
as 
exemplified 
not 
only 
by 
the 
elegant 
illustrations 
of 
mechanical 
principles 
which 
abound 
in 
this 
treatise, 
but 
also 
from 
his 
brilliant 
experiments 
on 
the 
photography 
of 
bullets.... 
A 
careful 
study 
of 
Professor 
Mach's 
work, 
and

more 
experimental 
illustration, 
on 
the 
lines 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
interesting 
diagrams 
of 
his 
Science

Mechanics, 
will 
do 
much 
to 
revivify 
theoretical

developed 
from 
the 
elements 
by 
rigorous 
logical 
treatment."—Prof.

G.

"Those 
who 
are 
curious 
to 
learn 
how 
the 
principles 
of 
mechanics 
have 
been 
evolved, 
from 
what 
source 
they 
take 
their 
origin, 
and 
how 
far 
they 
can 
be 
deemed 
of 
positive 
and 
permanent 
value, 
will 
find 
Dr. 
Mach's 
able 
treatise 
entrancingly 
interesting.... 
The 
book 
is 
a 
remarkable 
one 
in 
many 
respects, 
while 
the 
mixture 
of 
history 
with 
the 
latest 
scientific 
principles 
and 
absolute 
mathematical 
deductions 
makes 
it 
exceedingly 
attractive."—Mechanical

"Mach's 
Mechanics 
is 
unique. 
It 
is 
not 
a 
text-book, 
but 
forms 
a 
useful 
supplement 
to 
the 
ordinary 
text-book. 
The 
latter 
is 
usually 
a 
skeleton 
outline, 
full 
of 
mathematical 
symbols 
and 
other 
abstractions. 
Mach's 
book 
has 
'muscle 
and 
clothing,' 
and 
being 
written 
from 
the 
historical 
standpoint, 
introduces 
the 
leading 
contributors 
in 
succession, 
tells 
what 
they 
did 
and 
how 
they 
did 
it, 
and 
often 
what 
manner 
of 
men 
they 
were. 
Thus 
it 
is 
that 
the 
pages 
glow, 
as 
it 
were, 
with 
a 
certain 
humanism, 
quite 
delightful 
in

"Mr. 
T. 
J. 
McCormack, 
by 
his 
effective 
translation, 
where 
translation 
was 
no 
light 
task, 
of 
this 
masterly 
treatise 
upon 
the 
earliest 
and 
most 
fundamental 
of 
the 
sciences, 
has 
rendered 
no 
slight 
service 
to 
the 
English 
speaking 
student. 
The 
German 
and 
English 
languages 
are 
generally 
accounted 
second 
to 
none 
in 
their 
value 
as 
instruments 
for 
the 
expression 
of 
scientific 
thought; 
but 
the 
conversion 
bodily 
of 
an 
abstruse 
work 
from 
one 
into 
the 
other, 
so 
as 
to 
preserve 
all 
the 
meaning 
and 
spirit 
of 
the 
original 
and 
to 
set 
it 
easily 
and 
naturally 
into 
its 
new 
form, 
is 
a 
task 
of 
the 
greatest 
difficulty, 
and 
when 
performed 
so 
well 
as 
in 
the 
present 
instance, 
merits 
great 
commendation. 
Dr. 
Mach 
has 
created 
for 
his 
own 
works 
the 
severest 
possible 
standard 
of 
judgment. 
To 
expect 
no 
more 
from 
the 
books 
of 
such 
a 
master 
than 
from 
the 
elementary 
productions 
of 
an 
ordinary 
teacher 
in 
the 
science 
would 
be 
undue 
moderation. 
Our 
author 
has 
lifted 
what, 
to 
many 
of 
us, 
was 
at 
one 
time 
a 
course 
of 
seemingly 
unprofitable 
mental 
gymnastics, 
encompassed 
only 
at 
vast 
expenditure 
of 
intellectual 
effort, 
into 
a 
study 
possessing 
a 
deep 
philosophical 
value 
and 
instinct 
with 
life 
and 
interest. 
'No 
profit 
grows 
where

and 
the 
emancipated 
collegian 
will 
turn 
with 
pleasure 
from 
the 
narrow 
methods 
of 
the 
text-book 
to 
where 
the 
science 
is 
made 
to 
illustrate, 
by 
a

at

broad

deep,

producing 
the 
work 
in 
such 
good

good

I 
bought 
a 
copy 
of 
it 
a

very 
shortly

The

you 
are 
entitled 
to 
the 
thanks

all

"The

J.

I 
regard 
as 
a 
most 
valuable 
work, 
not 
only 
for 
acquainting 
the 
student 
with 
the 
history 
of 
the 
development 
of

but 
as 
serving 
to 
present 
to

most 
favorably 
the 
fundamental 
ideas 
of 
Mechanics 
and 
their 
rational 
connexion 
with 
the

It 
is 
a 
most 
profitable 
book 
to 
read

"A 
most 
fascinating 
volume, 
treating 
of 
phenomena 
in 
which 
all 
are 
interested, 
in 
a 
delightful 
style 
and 
with 
wonderful 
clearness. 
For 
lightness 
of 
touch 
and 
yet 
solid 
value 
of 
information 
the 
chapter 
'Why 
Has 
Man 
Two 
Eyes?' 
has 
scarcely 
a 
rival 
in 
the 
whole 
realm 
of 
popular 
scientific 
writing."—The 
Boston 
Traveller. 


"Truly 
remarkable 
in 
the 
insight 
they 
give 
into 
the 
relationship 
of 
the 
various 
fields 
cultivated 
under 
the 
name 
of 
Physics.... 
A 
vein 
of 
humor 
is 
met 
here 
and 
there 
reminding 
the 
reader 
of 
Heaviside, 
never 
offending 
one's 
taste. 
These 
features, 
together 
with 
the 
lightness 
of 
touch 
with 
which 
Mr. 
McCormack 
has 
rendered 
them, 
make 
the 
volume 
one 
that 
may 
be 
fairly 
called 
rare. 
The 
spirit 
of 
the 
author 
is 
preserved 
in 
such 
attractive, 
really 
delightful, 
English 
that 
one 
is 
assured 
nothing 
has 
been 
lost 
by 
translation."— 
Prof. 
Henry 
Crew, 
in 
The 
Astrophysical 
Journal. 


"A 
very 
delightful 
and 
useful 
book.... 
The 
author 
treats 
some 
of 
the 
most 
recondite 
problems 
of 
natural 
science, 
in 
so 
charmingly 
untechnical 
a 
way, 
with 
such 
a 
wealth 
of 
bright 
illustration, 
as 
makes 
his 
meaning 
clear 
to 
the 
person 
of 
ordinary 
intelligence 
and 
education.... 
This 
is 
a 
work 
that 
should 
find 
a 
place 
in 
every 
library, 
and 
that 
people 
should 
be 
encouraged 
to 
read."—Daily 
Picayune, 
New

"In 
his 
translation 
Mr. 
McCormack 
has 
well 
preserved 
the 
frank, 
simple, 
and 
pleasing 
style 
of 
this 
famous 
lecturer 
on 
scientific 
topics. 
Professor 
Mach 
deals 
with 
the 
live 
facts, 
the 
salient 
points 
of 
science, 
and 
not 
with 
its 
mysticism 
or 
dead 
traditions. 
He 
uses 
the 
simplest 
of 
illustrations 
and 
expresses 
himself 
clearly, 
tersely, 
and 
with 
a 
delightful 
freshness 
that 
makes 
entertaining 
reading 
of 
what 
in 
other 
hands 
would 
be 
dull 
and 
prosy."—Engineering 
News, 
N. 
Y. 


"The 
general 
reader 
is 
led 
by 
plain 
and 
easy 
steps 
along 
a 
delightful 
way 
through 
what 
would 
be 
to 
him 
without 
such 
a 
help 
a 
complicated 
maze 
of 
difficulties. 
Marvels 
are 
invented 
and 
science 
is 
revealed 
as

natural 
foe 
to 



mysteries."—The 
Chautauquan. 


"The 
beautiful 
quality 
of 
the 
work 
is 
not 
marred 
by 
abstruse 
discussions 
which 
would 
require 
a 
scientist 
to 
fathom, 
but 
is 
so 
simple 
and 
so 
clear 
that 
it 
brings 
us 
into 
direct 
contact 
with 
the 
matter 
treated."—The

"These 
lectures 
by 
Dr. 
Mach 
are 
delightfully 
simple 
and 
frank; 
there 
is 
no 
dryness 
or 
darkness 
of 
technicalities, 
and 
science 
and 
common 
life 
do 
not 
seem 
separated 
by 
a

The 
style 
is 
admirable,

the 
whole

seems 
gloriously 
alive

"The 
non-scientific

theories, 
and 
the 
reasons 
for 
their 
existence, 
cannot 
do 
better 
than 
carefully 
study 
these

"Professor 
Mach's

pleasantly 
written

that 
they 
have 
all 
the 
interest 
of 
lively 
fiction."—New

suggestiveness 
of

"All 
are 
presented 
so 
skilfully 
that 
one 
can 
imagine 
that 
Professor 
Mach's 
hearers 
departed 
from 
his 
lecture-room 
with 
the 
conviction 
that 
science 
was 
a 
matter 
for 
abecedarians. 
Will 
please 
those 
who 
find 
the 
fairy 
tales 
of 
science 
more 
absorbing 
than 
fiction."—The

"Professor 
Mach

"I 
consider

"There 
is 
no 
work 
known 
to 
the 
writer 
which, 
in 
its 
general 
scientific 
bearings, 
is 
more 
likely 
to 
repay 
richly 
thorough 
study. 
We 
are 
all 
interested 
in

one 
way 
or 
another,

our

clarified 
by 
Mach's 
wonderfully 
original

wholesome

It 
is 
not 
saying 
too 
much 
to 
maintain 
that 
every 
intelligent

"Students

here

the 
acquaintance

some

the 
same 
time 
take 
a 
lesson

the 
Religion 
of

and 
the 
Extension 
of 
the 
Religious 
Parliament 
Idea. 


THE 
OPEN 
COURT 
does 
not 
understand 
by 
religion 
any 
creed 
or 
dogmatic 
belief, 
but 
man's 
world-conception 
in 
so 
far 
as 
it 
regulates 
his 
conduct. 


The 
old 
dogmatic 
conception 
of 
religion 
is 
based 
upon 
the 
science 
of 
past 
ages; 
to 
base 
religion 
upon 
the 
maturest 
and 
truest 
thought 
of 
the 
present 
time 
is 
the 
object 
of 
The 
Open 
Court. 
Thus, 
the 
religion 
of 
The 
Open 
Court 
is 
the 
Religion 
of 
Science, 
that 
is, 
the 
religion 
of 
verified 
and 
verifiable 
truth. 


Although 
opposed 
to 
irrational 
orthodoxy 
and 
narrow 
bigotry, 
The 
Open 
Court 
does 
not 
attack 
the 
properly 
religious 
element 
of 
the 
various 
religions. 
It 
criticises 
their 
errors 
unflinchingly 
but 
without 
animosity, 
and 
endeavors 
to 
preserve 
of 
them 
all 
that 
is 
true 
and 
good. 


The 
current 
numbers 
of 
The 
Open

valuable 
original

Science 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
maximum 
or 
minimum 
problem, 
exactly 
as 
the 
business 
of 
the 
merchant. 
In 
fact, 
the 
intellectual 
activity 
of 
natural 
inquiry 
is 
not 
so 
greatly 
different 
from 
that 
exercised 
in 
ordinary 
life 
as 
is 
usually 
supposed.

This 
experiment, 
with 
its 
associated 
reflexions, 
is 
due 
to

also 
set 
out 
from 
Leibnitz's 
idea, 
but 
arrived 
by 
independent 
researches 
at 
a 
different 
theory, 
which 
was 
very 
near 
to 
that 
of 
Helmholtz. 
Compare 
on 
this 
point

According 
to 
Mr. 
Jules 
Andrieu, 
the 
idea 
that 
nature 
must 
be 
tortured 
to 
reveal 
her 
secrets 
is 
preserved 
in 
the 
name 
crucible—from 
the 
Latin 
crux, 
a 
cross. 
But, 
more 
probably, 
crucible 
is 
derived 
from 
some 
Old 
French 
or 
Teutonic 
form, 
as 
cruche, 
kroes, 
krus, 
etc., 
a 
pot 
or 
jug 
(cf. 
Modern 
English 
crock, 
cruse, 
and 
German 
Krug).—Trans. 
[12] 
Xenophon, 
Memorabilia 
iv, 
7, 
puts 
into 
the 
mouth 
of 
Socrates 
these 
words: 
οὔτε 
γὰρ 
εὑρετὰ 
ἀνθρώποις 
αὐτὰ 
ἐνόμιζεν 
εἶναι, 
οὔτε 
χαρίζεσθαι 
θεοῖς 
ἂν 
ἡγεῖτο 
τὸν 
ζητοῦντα 
ἃ 
ἐκεῖνοι 
σαφηνίσαι 
οὐκ 
ἐβουλήθησαν.

In 
the 
same 
way, 
the 
pitch 
of 
a 
locomotive-whistle 
is 
higher 
as 
the 
locomotive 
rapidly 
approaches 
an 
observer, 
and 
lower 
when 
rapidly 
leaving 
him 
than 
if 
the 
locomotive 
were 
at 
rest.—Trans.

A 
kilometre 
is 
0.621 
or 
nearly 
five-eighths 
of 
a 
statute 
mile.

Observe, 
also, 
the 
respect 
in 
which 
the 
wheel 
is 
held 
in 
India, 
Japan 
and 
other 
Buddhistic 
countries, 
as 
the 
emblem 
of 
power, 
order, 
and 
law, 
and 
of 
the 
superiority 
of 
mind 
over 
matter. 
The 
consciousness 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
invention 
seems 
to 
have 
lingered 
long 
in 
the 
minds 
of 
these 
nations.—Tr. 
[17] 
This 
effect 
is 
particularly 
noticeable 
in

size

J. 
P. 
Soret, 
Sur 
la 
perception 
du 
beau 
(Geneva, 
1892), 
also 
regards 
repetition 
as 
a 
principle 
of 
æsthetics. 
His 
discussions 
of 
the 
æsthetical 
side 
of 
the 
subject 
are 
much 
more 
detailed 
than 
mine. 
But 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
psychological 
and 
physiological 
foundation 
of 
the 
principle, 
I 
am 
convinced 
that 
the 
Contributions 
to 
the 
Analysis 
of 
the 
Sensations 
go 
deeper.—MACH

Kant, 
in 
his 
Prolegomena 
zu 
jeder 
künftigen 
Metaphysik, 
also 
refers 
to 
this 
fact, 
but 
for 
a 
different 
purpose.

The 
fact 
that 
the 
first 
and 
second 
differential 
coefficients 
of 
a 
curve 
are 
directly 
seen, 
but 
the 
higher 
coefficients 
not, 
is 
very 
simply 
explained. 
The 
first 
gives 
the 
position 
of 
the 
tangent, 
the 
declination 
of 
the 
straight 
line 
from 
the 
position 
of 
symmetry, 
the 
second 
the 
declination 
of 
the 
curve 
from 
the 
straight 
line. 
It 
is, 
perhaps, 
not 
unprofitable 
to 
remark 
here 
that 
the 
ordinary 
method 
of 
testing 
rulers 
and 
plane 
surfaces 
(by 
reversed 
applications) 
ascertains 
the 
deviation 
of 
the 
object 
from 
symmetry 
to 
itself.

[27] 
If 
the 
two 
bodies 
were 
oppositely 
electrified 
they 
would 
exert 
attractions 
upon 
each 
other. 
[28] 
The 
quantity 
which 
flows 
off 
is 
in 
point 
of 
fact 
less 
than 
q. 
It 
would 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
quantity 
q 
only 
if 
the 
inner 
coating 
of 
the 
jar 
were 
wholly 
encompassed 
by 
the 
outer 
coating. 
[29] 
Rigorously, 
of 
course, 
this 
is 
not 
correct. 
First, 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noted 
that 
the 
jar 
L 
is 
discharged 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
electrode 
of 
the 
machine. 
The 
jar 
F, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
always 
discharged 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
outer 
coating 
of 
the 
jar 
L. 
Hence, 
if 
we 
call 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
electrode 
of 
the 
machine 
E, 
that 
of 
the 
unit 
jar 
L, 
that 
of 
the 
outer 
coating 
of 
L, 
A, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
principal 
jar 
F, 
then 
this 
equation 
would 
exist 
for 
the 
example 
in 
the 
text: 
(F 
+ 
A)/(L 
+ 
E) 
= 
5. 
A 
cause 
of 
further 
departure 
from 
absolute 
exactness 
is 
the 
residual 
charge. 
[30] 
Making 
allowance 
for 
the 
corrections 
indicated 
in 
the 
preceding 
footnote, 
I 
have 
obtained 
for 
the 
dielectric 
constant 
of 
sulphur 
the 
number 
3.2, 
which 
agrees 
practically 
with 
the 
results 
obtained 
by 
more 
delicate 
methods. 
For 
the 
highest 
attainable 
precision 
one 
should 
by 
rights 
immerse 
the 
two 
plates 
of 
the 
condenser 
first 
wholly 
in 
air 
and 
then 
wholly 
in 
sulphur, 
if 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
capacities 
is 
to 
correspond 
to 
the 
dielectric 
constant. 
In 
point 
of 
fact, 
however, 
the 
error 
which 
arises 
from 
inserting 
simply 
a 
plate 
of 
sulphur 
that 
exactly 
fills 
the 
space 
between 
the 
two 
plates, 
is 
of 
no 
consequence. 
[31] 
As 
this 
definition 
in 
its 
simple 
form 
is 
apt 
to 
give 
rise 
to 
misunderstandings, 
elucidations 
are 
usually 
added 
to 
it. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
we 
cannot 
lift 
a 
quantity 
of 
electricity 
to 
K, 
without 
changing 
the 
distribution 
on 
K 
and 
the 
potential 
on 
K. 
Hence, 
the 
charges 
on 
K 
must 
be 
conceived 
as 
fixed, 
and 
so 
small 
a 
quantity 
raised 
that 
no 
appreciable 
change 
is 
produced 
by 
it. 
Taking 
the 
work 
thus 
expended 
as 

many 
times 
as 
the 
small 
quantity 
in 
question 
is 
contained 
in 
the 
unit 
of 
quantity, 
we 
shall 
obtain 
the 
potential. 
The 
potential 
of 
a 
body 
K 
may 
be 
briefly 
and 
precisely 
defined 
as 
follows: 
If 
we 
expend 
the 
element 
of 
work 
dW 
to 
raise 
the 
element 
of 
positive 
quantity 
dQ 
from 
the 
earth 
to 
the 
conductor, 
the 
potential 
of 
a 
conductor 
K 
will 
be 
given 
by 
V 
= 
dW/dQ.

In 
this 
article

or 
slant 
stroke

fractional 
sign 
of 
division.

or

[33] 
A 
sort 
of 
agreement 
exists 
between 
the 
notions 
of 
thermal 
and 
electrical 
capacity, 
but 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
ideas 
also 
should 
be 
carefully 
borne 
in 
mind. 
The 
thermal 
capacity 
of 
a 
body 
depends 
solely 
upon 
that 
body 
itself. 
The 
electrical 
capacity 
of 
a 
body 
K 
is 
influenced 
by 
all 
bodies 
in 
its 
vicinity, 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
charge 
of 
these 
bodies 
is 
able 
to 
alter 
the 
potential 
of 
K. 
To 
give, 
therefore, 
an 
unequivocal 
significance 
to 
the 
notion 
of 
the 
capacity 
(C) 
of 
a 
body 
K, 
C 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
relation 
Q/V 
for 
the 
body 
K 
in 
a 
certain 
given 
position 
of 
all 
neighboring 
bodies, 
and 
during 
connexion 
of 
all 
neighboring 
conductors 
with 
the 
earth. 
In 
practice 
the 
situation 
is 
much 
simpler. 
The 
capacity, 
for 
example, 
of 
a 
jar, 
the 
inner 
coating 
of 
which 
is 
almost 
enveloped 
by 
its 
outer 
coating, 
communicating 
with 
the 
ground, 
is 
not 
sensibly 
affected 
by 
charged 
or 
uncharged 
adjacent 
conductors. 
[34] 
These 
formulæ 
easily 
follow 
from 
Newton's 
theorem 
that 
a 
homogeneous 
spherical 
shell, 
whose 
elements 
obey 
the 
law 
of 
the 
inverse 
squares, 
exerts 
no 
force 
whatever 
on 
points 
within 
it 
but 
acts 
on 
points 
without 
as 
if 
the 
whole 
mass 
were 
concentrated 
at 
its 
centre. 
The 
formulæ 
next 
adduced 
also 
flow 
from 
this 
proposition. 
[35] 
The 
energy 
of 
a 
sphere 
of 
radius 
r 
charged 
with 
the 
quantity 
q 
is 
1/2(q 
2/r). 
If 
the 
radius 
increase 
by 
the 
space 
dr 
a 
loss 
of 
energy 
occurs, 
and 
the 
work 
done 
is 
1/2(q 
2/r 
2)dr. 
Letting 
p 
denote 
the 
uniform 
electrical 
pressure 
on 
unit 
of 
surface 


of 
the 
sphere, 
the 
work 
done 
is 
also 
4r 
2πpdr. 
Hence 
p 
= 
(1/8r 
2π)(q 
2/r 
2). 
Subjected 
to 
the 
same 
superficial 
pressure 
on 
all 
sides, 
say 
in 
a 
fluid, 
our 
half 
sphere 
would 
be 
an 
equilibrium. 
Hence 
we 
must 
make 
the 
pressure 
p 
act 
on 
the 


surface 
of 
the 
great 
circle 
to 
obtain 
the 
effect 
on 
the 
balance, 
which 
is 
r 
2πp 
= 


1/8(q 
2/r 
2) 
= 
1/8V 
2. 


[36] 
The 
arrangement 
described 
is 
for 
several 
reasons 
not 
fitted 
for 
the 
actual 
measurement 
of 
potential. 
Thomson's 
absolute 
electrometer 
is 
based 
upon 
an 
ingenious 
modification 
of 
the 
electrical 
balance 
of 
Harris 
and 
Volta. 
Of 
two 
large 
plane 
parallel 
plates, 
one 
communicates 
with 
the 
earth, 
while 
the 
other 
is 
brought 
to 
the 
potential 
to 
be 
measured. 
A 
small 
movable 
superficial 
portion 
f 
of 
this 
last 
hangs 
from 
the 
balance 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
attraction 
P. 
The 
distance 
of 
the 
plates 
from 
each 
other 
being 
D 
we 
get 
V 
= 
D√(8πP/f). 
[37] 
This 
moment 
of 
torsion 
needs 
a 
supplementary 
correction, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
vertical 
electric 
attraction 
of 
the 
excited 
disks. 
This 
is 
done 
by 
changing 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
disk 
by 
means 
of 
additional 
weights 
and 
by 
making 
a 
second 
reading 
of 
the 

angles 
of 
deflexion. 


[38] 
The 
jar 
in 
our 
experiment 
acts 
like 
an 
accumulator, 
being 
charged 
by 
a 
dynamo 
machine. 
The 
relation 
which 
obtains 
between 
the 
expended 
and 
the 
available 
work 
may 
be 
gathered 
from 
the 
following 
simple 
exposition. 
A 
Holtz 
machine 
H 
(Fig. 
40) 
is 
charging 
a 
unit 
jar 
L, 
which 
after 
n 
discharges 
of 
quantity 
q 
and 
potential 
v, 
charges 
the 
jar 
F 
with 
the 
quantity 
Q 
at 
the 
potential 
V. 
The 
energy 
of 
the 
unit-jar 
discharges 
is 
lost 
and 
that 
of 
the 
jar 
F 
alone 
is 
left. 
Hence 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
available 
work 
to 
the 
total 
work 
expended 
is 
½QV/[½QV 
+ 
(n/2)qv] 
and 
as 
Q 
= 
nq, 
also 
V/(V 
+ 
v). 


If, 
now, 
we 
interpose 
no 
unit 
jar, 
still 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
machine 
and 
the 
wires 
of 
conduction 
are 
themselves 
virtually 
such 
unit 
jars 
and 
the 
formula 
still 
subsists 
V/(V 
+Σv), 
in 
which 
Σv 
represents 
the 
sum 
of 
all 
the 
successively 
introduced 
differences 
of 
potential 
in 
the 
circuit 
of 
connexion.

l'intoppo 
si 
metesse 
più 
basso, 
come 
in 
F, 
dove 
la 
palla 
descriverebbe 
l'arco 
BJ, 
terminando 
sempre 
la 
sua 
salita 
precisamente 
nella 
linea 
CD, 
e 
quando 
l'intoppe 
del 
chiodo 
fusse 
tanto 
basso, 
che 
l'avanzo 
del 
filo 
sotto 
di 
lui 
non 
arivasse 
all'altezza 
di 
CD 
(il 
che 
accaderebbe, 
quando 
fusse 
più 
vicino 
al 
punto 
B, 
che 
al 
segamento 
dell' 
AB 
coll'orizzontale 
CD), 
allora 
il 
filo 
cavalcherebbe 
il 
chiodo, 
e 
segli 
avolgerebbe 
intorno. 
Questa 
esperienza 
non 
lascia 
luogo 
di 
dubitare 
della 
verità 
del 
supposto: 
imperocchè 
essendo 
li 
due 
archi 
CB, 
DB 
equali 
e 
similmento 
posti, 
l'acquisto 
di 
momento 
fatto 
per 
la 
scesa 
nell'arco 
CB, 
è 
il 
medesimo, 
che 
il 
fatto 
per 
la 
scesa 
dell'arco 
DB; 
ma 
il 
momento 
acquistato 
in 
B 
per 
l'arco 
CB 
è 
potente 
a 
risospingere 
in 
su 
il 
medesimo 
mobile 
per 
l'arco 
BD; 
adunque 
anco 
il 
momento 
acquistato 
nella 
scesa 
DB 
è 
eguale 
a 
quello, 
che 
sospigne 
l'istesso 
mobile 
pel 
medesimo 
arco 
da 
B 
in 
D, 
sicche 
universal-mente 
ogni 
memento 
acquistato 
per 
la 
scesa 
d'un 
arco 
è 
eguale 
a 
quello, 
che 
può 
far 
risalire 
l'istesso 
mobile 
pel 
medesimo 
arco: 
ma 
i 
momenti 
tutti 
che 
fanno 
resalire 
per 
tutti 
gli 
archi

BG, 
BJ 
sono 
eguali, 
poichè 
son 
fatti 
dal 
istesso 
medesimo 
momento 
acquistato 
per 
la 
scesa 
CB, 
come 
mostra 
l'esperienza: 
adunque 
tutti 
i 
momenti, 
che 
si 
acquistano 
per 
le

[56] 
I 
first 
drew 
attention 
to 
this 
fact 
in 
my 
treatise 
Ueber 
die 
Erhaltung 
der 
Arbeit, 
Prague, 
1872. 
Before 
this, 
Zeuner 
had 
pointed 
out 
the 
analogy 
between 
mechanical 
and 
thermal 
energy. 
I 
have 
given 
a 
more 
extensive 
development 
of 
this 
idea 
in 
a 
communication 
to 
the 
Sitzungsberichte

1892, 
entitled

(1892). 
[57] 
Sir 
William 
Thomson 
first 
consciously 
and 
intentionally 
introduced 
(1848, 
1851) 
a 
mechanical 
measure 
of 
temperature 
similar 
to 
the 
electric 
measure 
of 
potential.

[59] 
A 
better 
terminology 
appears 
highly 
desirable 
in 
the 
place 
of 
the 
usual 
misleading 
one. 
Sir 
William 
Thomson 
(1852) 
appears 
to 
have 
felt 
this 
need, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
clearly 
expressed 
by 
F. 
Wald 
(1889). 
We 
should 
call 
the 
work 
which 
corresponds 
to 
a 
vanished 
quantity 
of 
heat 
its 
mechanical 
substitution-value; 
while 
that 
work 
which 
can 
be 
actually 
performed 
in 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
thermal 
condition 
A 
to 
a 
condition 
B, 
alone 
deserves 
the 
name 
of 
the 
energy-value 
of 
this 
change 
of 
condition. 
In 
this 
way 
the 
arbitrary 
substantial 
conception 
of 
the 
processes 
would 
be 
preserved 
and 
misapprehensions 
forestalled.

It 
is 
clear 
from 
this 
that 
all 
so-called 
elementary 
(differential) 
laws 
involve 
a 
relation 
to 
the 
whole. 
[66] 
If 
it 
be 
objected, 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
perturbations 
of 
the 
velocity 
of 
rotation 
of 
the 
earth, 
we 
could 
be 
sensible 
of 
such 
perturbations, 
and 
being 
obliged 
to 
have 
some 
measure 
of 
time, 
we 
should 
resort 
to 
the 
period 
of 
vibration 
of 
the 
waves 
of 
sodium 
light,—all 
that 
this 
would 
show 
is 
that 
for 
practical 
reasons 
we 
should 
select 
that 
event 
which 
best 
served 
us 
as 
the 
simplest 
common 
measure 
of 
the 
others. 
[67] 
Measurement, 
in 
fact, 
is 
the 
definition 
of 
one 
phenomenon 
by 
another 
(standard) 
phenomenon. 
[68] 
I 
have 
represented 
the 
point 
of 
view 
here 
taken 
for 
more 
than 
thirty 
years 
and 

developed 
it 
in 
various 
writings 
(Erhaltung

parts 
of 
which 
are 
published 
in

The

though 
known 
to

is 
unfamiliar 
to 
the

It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
deep 
regret 
to 
me, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
title 
and 
author 
of 
a 
small 
tract

accorded 
with 
my 
views 
in 
numerous 
details 
and 
which 
I 
remember 
having 
caught 
a 
glance 
of 
in 
a 
very 
busy 
period 
(1879-1880), 
have 
so 
completely 
disappeared 
from 
my 
memory 
that 
all 
efforts 
to 
obtain 
a 
clue 
to 
them 
have 
hitherto 
been 
fruitless.

Inaugural 
Address, 
delivered 
on 
assuming 
the 
Rectorate 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Prague, 
October 
18, 
1883. 
The 
idea 
presented 
in 
this 
essay 
is 
neither 
new 
nor 
remote. 
I 
have 
touched 
upon 
it 
myself 
on 
several 
occasions 
(first 
in 
1867), 
but 
have 
never 
made 
it 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
formal 
disquisition. 
Doubtless, 
others, 
too, 
have 
treated 
it; 
it 
lies, 
so 
to 
speak, 
in 
the 
air. 
However, 
as 
many 
of 
my 
illustrations 
were 
well 
received, 
although 
known 
only 
in 
an 
imperfect 
form 
from 
the 
lecture 
itself 
and 
the 
newspapers, 
I 
have, 
contrary 
to 
my 
original 
intention, 
decided 
to 
publish 
it. 
It 
is 
not 
my 
intention 
to 
trespass 
here 
upon 
the 
domain 
of 
biology. 
My 
statements 
are 
to 
be 
taken 
merely 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
no 
one 
can 
escape 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
great 
and 
far-
reaching 
idea. 


[70] 
At 
first 
sight 
an 
apparent 
contradiction 
arises 
from 
the 
admission 
of 
both 
heredity 
and 
adaptation; 
and 
it 
is 
undoubtedly 
true 
that 
a 
strong 
disposition 
to 
heredity 
precludes 
great 
capability 
of 
adaptation. 
But 
imagine 
the 
organism 
to 
be 
a 
plastic 
mass 
which 
retains 
the 
form 
transmitted 
to 
it 
by 
former 
influences 
until 
new 
influences 
modify 
it; 
the 
one 
property 
of 
plasticity 
will 
then 
represent 
capability 
of 
adaptation 
as 
well 
as 
power 
of 
heredity. 
Analogous 
to 
this 
is 
the 
case 
of 
a 
bar 
of 
magnetised 
steel 
of 
high 
coercive 
force: 
the 
steel 
retains 
its 
magnetic 
properties 
until 
a 
new 
force 
displaces 
them. 
Take 
also 
a 
body 
in 
motion: 
the 
body 
retains 
the 
velocity 
acquired 
in 
(inherited 
from) 
the 
interval 
of 
time 
just 
preceding, 
except 
it 
be 
changed 
in 
the 
next 
moment 
by 
an 
accelerating 
force. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
body 
in 
motion 
the 
change 
of 
velocity 
(Abänderung) 
was 
looked 
upon 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
course, 
while 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
inertia 
(or 
persistence) 
created 
surprise; 
in 
Darwin's 
case, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
heredity 
(or 
persistence) 
was 
taken 
for 
granted, 
while 
the 
principle 
of 
variation 
(Abänderung) 
appeared 
novel. 
Fully 
adequate 
views 
are, 
of 
course, 
to 
be 
reached 
only 
by 
a 
study 
of 
the 
original 
facts 
emphasised 
by 
Darwin, 
and 
not 
by 
these 
analogies. 
The 
example 
referring 
to 
motion, 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
I 
first 
heard, 
in 
conversation, 
from 
my 
friend 
J. 
Popper, 
Esq., 
of 
Vienna. 


Many 
inquirers 
look 
upon 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
species 
as 
something 
settled, 
and 
oppose 
to 
it 
the 
Darwinian 
theory. 
But 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
species 
is 
itself 
a 
"theory." 
The 
essential 
modifications 
which 
Darwin's 
views 
also 
are 
undergoing 
will 
be 
seen 
from 
the 
works 
of 
Wallace 
[and 
Weismann], 
but 
more 
especially 
from 
a 
book 
of 
W. 
H. 
Rolph, 
Biologische 
Probleme, 
Leipsic, 
1882. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
last 
talented 
investigator 
is 
no 
longer 
numbered 
among 
the 
living.

I 
am 
well 
aware 
that 
the 
endeavor 
to 
confine 
oneself 
in 
natural 
research 
to 
facts 
is 
often 
censured 
as 
an 
exaggerated 
fear 
of 
metaphysical 
spooks. 
But 
I 
would 
observe, 
that, 
judged 
by 
the 
mischief 
which 
they 
have 
wrought, 
the 
metaphysical, 
of 
all 
spooks, 
are 
the 
least 
fabulous. 
It 
is 
not 
to 
be 
denied 
that 
many 
forms 
of 
thought 
were 
not 
originally 
acquired 
by 
the 
individual, 
but 
were 
antecedently 
formed, 
or 
rather 
prepared 
for, 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
species, 
in 
some 
such 
way 
as 
Spencer, 
Haeckel, 
Hering, 
and 
others 
have 
supposed, 
and 
as 
I 
myself 
have 
hinted 
on 
various 
occasions. 
[77] 
Compare, 
for 
example, 
Schiller, 
Zerstreute 
Betrachtungen 
über 
verschiedene 
ästhetische 
Gegenstände. 
[78] 
We 
must 
not 
be 
deceived 
in 
imagining 
that 
the 
happiness 
of 
other 
people 
is 
not 
a 
very 
considerable 
and 
essential 
portion 
of 
our 
own. 
It 
is 
common 
capital, 
which 
cannot 
be 
created 
by 
the 
individual, 
and 
which 
does 
not 
perish 
with 
him. 
The 
formal 
and 
material 
limitation 
of 
the 
ego 
is 
necessary 
and 
sufficient 
only 
for 
the 
crudest 
practical 
objects, 
and 
cannot 
subsist 
in 
a 
broad 
conception. 
Humanity 
in 
its 
entirety 
may 
be 
likened 
to 
a 
polyp-plant. 
The 
material 
and 
organic 
bonds 
of 
individual 
union 
have, 
indeed, 
been 
severed; 
they 
would 
only 
have 
impeded 
freedom 
of 
movement 
and 
evolution. 
But 
the 
ultimate 
aim, 
the 
psychical 
connexion 
of 
the 
whole, 
has 
been 
attained 
in 
a 
much 
higher 
degree 
through 
the 
richer 
development 
thus 
made 
possible.

conceiving 
it

My

was 
recently 
called 
to 
this 
work 
by 
Dr. 
W.

[95] 
Similarly 
many 
external 
forces 
do 
not 
act 
at 
once 
on 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
earth, 
and 
the 
internal 
forces 
which 
produce 
deformations 
act 
at 
first 
immediately 
only 
upon 
limited 
parts. 
If 
the 
earth 
were 
a 
feeling 
being, 
the 
tides 
and 
other 
terrestrial 
events 
would 
provoke 
in 
it 
similar 
sensations 
to 
those 
of 
our 
movements. 
Perhaps 
the 
slight 
alterations 
of 
the 
altitude 
of 
the 
pole 
which 
are 
at 
present 
being 
studied 
are 
connected 
with 
the 
continual 
slight 
deformations 
of 
the 
central 
ellipsoid 
occasioned 
by 
seismical 
happenings. 
[96] 
For 
the 
popular 
explanation 
by 
unconscious 
inference 
the 
matter 
is 
extremely 

simple. 
We 
regard 
the 
railway 
carriage 
as 
vertical 
and 
unconsciously 
infer 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
trees. 
Of 
course 
the 
opposite 
conclusion 
that 
we 
regard 
the 
trees 
as 
vertical 
and 
infer 
the 
inclination 
of 
the 
carriage, 
unfortunately, 
is 
equally 
clear 
on 
this 
theory. 


[97] 
It 
will 
be 
observed 
that 
my 
way 
of 
thinking 
and 
experimenting 
here 
is 
related 
to 
that 
which 
led 
Knight 
to 
the 
discovery 
and 
investigation 
of 
the 
geotropism 
of 
plants. 
Philosophical 
Transactions, 
January 
9, 
1806. 
The 
relations 
between 
vegetable 
and 
animal 
geotropism 
have 
been 
more 
recently 
investigated 
by 
J. 
Loeb. 
[98] 
This 
experiment 
is 
doubtless 
related 
to 
the 
galvanotropic 
experiment 
with 
the 
larvæ 
of 
frogs 
described 
ten 
years 
later 
by 
L. 
Hermann.

on 
this 
point

the

which 
rests

an 
error, 
is, 
as 
I 
have 
also 
elsewhere 
remarked, 
to 
be 
stricken 
out.

another

The 
experiment 
was 
specially 
interesting 
for 
me 
as 
I 
had 
already 
attempted 
in 
1874, 
although 
with 
very 
little 
confidence 
and 
without 
success, 
to 
excite 
electromagnetically 
my 
own 
labyrinth 
through 
which 
I 
had 
caused 
a 
current 
to 
pass. 
[105] 
Perhaps 
the 
discussion 
concerning 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
cats 
always 
falling 
on 
their 
feet, 
which 
occupied 
the 
Parisian 
Academy, 
and, 
incidentally, 
Parisian 
society 
a 
few 
years 
ago, 
will 
be 
remembered 
here. 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
questions 
which 
arose 
are 
disposed 
of 
by 
the 
considerations 
advanced 
in 
my 
Bewegungsempfindungen 
(1875). 
I 
also 
partly 
gave, 
as 
early 
as 
1866, 
the 
apparatus 
conceived 
by 
the 
Parisian 
scientists 
to 
illustrate 
the 
phenomena 
in 
question. 
One 
difficulty 
was 
left 
untouched 
in 
the 
Parisian 
debate. 
The 
otolith 
apparatus 
of 
the 
cat 
can 
render 
it 
no 
service 
in 
free 
descent. 
The 
cat, 
however, 
while 
at 
rest, 
doubtless 
knows 
its 
position 
in 
space 
and 
is 
instinctively 
conscious 
of 
the 
amount 
of 
movement 
which 
will 
put 
it 
on 
its 
feet.

The 
German 
phrase 
is 
Schlierenmethode, 
by 
which 
term 
the 
method 
is 
known 
even 
by 
American 
physicists. 
It 
is 
also 
called 
in 
English 
the 
"shadowmethod." 
But 
a 
term 
is 
necessary 
which 
will 
cover 
all 
the 
derivatives, 
and 
so 
we 
have 
employed 
alternatively 
the 
words 
striate 
and 
differential. 
The 
etymology 
of 
schlieren, 
it 
would 
seem, 
is 
uncertain. 
Its 
present 
use 
is 
derived 
from 
its 
technological 
signification 
in 
glass-manufacturing, 
where 
by 
die 
Schlieren 
are 
meant 
the 
wavy 
streaks 
and 
imperfections 
in 
glass. 
Hence 
its 
application 
to 
the 
method 
for 
detecting 
small 
optical 
differences 
and 
faults 
generally. 
Professor 
Crew 
of 
Evanston 
suggests 
to 
the 
translator 
that 
schlieren 
may 
be 
related 
to 
our 
slur 
(L. 
G., 
slüren, 
to 
trail, 
to 
draggle), 
a 
conjecture 
which 
is 
doubtless 
correct 
and 
agrees 
both 
with 
the 
meaning 
of 
schlieren 
as 
given 
in 
the 
large 
German 
dictionaries 
and 
with 
the 
intransitive 
use 
of 
our 
own 
verb 
slur, 
the 
faults 
in 
question 
being 
conceived 
as 
"trailings," 
"streakings," 
etc.—Trans.

An 
address 
delivered 
before 
the 
Congress 
of 
Delegates 
of 
the 
German 
Realschulmännerverein, 
at 
Dortmund, 
April 
16, 
1886. 
The 
full 
title 
of 
the 
address 
reads: 
"On 
the 
Relative 
Educational 
Value 
of 
the 
Classics 
and 
the 
Mathematico-
Physical 
Sciences 
in 
Colleges 
and 
High 
Schools." 
Although 
substantially 
contained 
in 
an 
address 
which 
I 
was 
to 
have 
made 
at 
the 
meeting 
of 
Natural 
Scientists 
at 
Salzburg 
in 
1881 
(deferred 
on 
account 
of 
the 
Paris 
Exposition), 
and 
in 
the 
Introduction 
to 
a 
course 
of 
lectures 
on 
"Physical 
Instruction 
in 
Preparatory 
Schools," 
which 
I 
delivered 
in 
1883, 
the 
invitation 
of 
the 
German 
Realschulmännerverein 
afforded 
me 
the 
first 
opportunity 
of 
putting 
my 
views 
upon 
this 
subject 
before 
a 
large 
circle 
of 
readers. 
Owing 
to 
the 
place 
and 
circumstances 
of 
delivery, 
my 
remarks 
apply 
of 
course, 
primarily, 
only 
to 
German 
schools, 
but, 
with 
slight 
modifications, 
made 
in 
this 
translation, 
are 
not 
without 
force 
for 
the 
institutions 
of 
other 
countries. 
In 
giving 
here 
expression 
to 
a 
strong 
personal 
conviction 
formed 
long 
ago, 
it 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
deep 
satisfaction 
to 
me 
to 
find 
that 
they 
agree 
in 
many 
points 
with 
the 
views 
recently 
advanced 
in 
independent 
form 
by 
Paulsen 
(Geschichte 
des 
gelehrten 
Unterrichts, 
Leipsic, 
1885) 
and 
Frary 
(La 
question 
du 
latin, 
Paris, 
Cerf, 
1885). 
It 
is 
not 
my 
desire 
nor 
effort 
here 
to 
say 
much 
that 
is 
new, 
but 
merely 
to 
contribute 
my 
mite 
towards 
bringing 
about 
the 
inevitable 
revolution 
now 
preparing 
in 
the 
world 
of 
elementary 
instruction. 
In 
the 
opinion 
of 
experienced 
educationists 
the 
first 
result 
of 
that 
revolution 
will 
be 
to 
make 
Greek 
and 
mathematics 
alternately 
optional 
subjects 
in 
the 
higher 
classes 
of 
the 
German 
Gymnasium 
and 
in 
the 
corresponding 
institutions 
of 
other 
countries, 
as 
has 
been 
done 
in 
the 
splendid

The 
gap 
between 
the 
German 
classical 
Gymnasium 
and 
the 
German 
Realgymnasium, 
or 
between 
classical 
and 
scientific 
schools 
generally, 
can 
thus 
be 
bridged 
over, 
and 
the 
remaining 
inevitable 
transformations 
will 
then 
be 
accomplished 
in 
relative 
peace 
and 
quiet.

[116] 
There 
is 
a 
peculiar 
irony 
of 
fate 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
while 
Leibnitz 
was 
casting 
about 
for 
a 
new 
vehicle 
of 
universal 
linguistic 
intercourse, 
the 
Latin 
language 
which 
still 
subserved 
this 
purpose 
the 
best 
of 
all, 
was 
dropping 
more 
and 
more 
out 
of 
use, 
and 
that 
Leibnitz 
himself 
contributed 
not 
the 
least 
to 
this 
result. 
[117] 
As 
a 
rule, 
the 
human 
brain 
is 
too 
much, 
and 
wrongly, 
burdened 
with 
things 
which 
might 
be 
more 
conveniently 
and 
accurately 
preserved 
in 
books 
where 
they 
could 
be 
found 
at 
a 
moment's 
notice. 
In 
a 
recent 
letter 
to 
me 
from 
Düsseldorf, 
Judge 
Hartwich 
writes: 
"A 
host 
of 
words 
exist 
which 
are 
out 
and 
out 
Latin 
or 
Greek, 
yet 
are 
employed 
with 
perfect 
correctness 
by 
people 
of 
good 
education 
who 
never 
had 
the 
good 
luck 
to 
be 
taught 
the 
ancient 
languages. 
For 
example, 
words 
like 
'dynasty.' 
... 
The 
child 
learns 
such 
words 
as 
parts 
of 
the 
common 
stock 
of 
speech, 
or 
even 
as 
parts 
of 
his 
mother-tongue, 
just 
as 
he 
does 
the 
words 
'father,' 
'mother,' 
'bread,' 
'milk.' 
Does 
the 
ordinary 
mortal 
know 
the 
etymology 
of 
these 
Saxon 
words? 
Did 
it 
not 
require 
the 
almost 
incredible 
industry 
of 
the 
Grimms 
and 
other 
Teutonic 
philologists 
to 
throw 
the 
merest 
glimmerings 
of 
light 
upon 
the 
origin 
and 
growth 
of 
our 
own 
mother-
tongue? 
Besides, 
do 
not 
thousands 
of 
people 
of 
so-called 
classical 
education 
use 
every 
moment 
hosts 
of 
words 
of 
foreign 
origin 
whose 
derivation 
they 
do 
not 
know? 
Very 
few 
of 
them 
think 
it 
worth 
while 
to 
look 
up 
such 
words 
in 
the 
dictionaries, 
although 
they 
love 
to 
maintain 
that 
people 
should 
study 
the 
ancient 
languages 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
etymology 
alone." 


[118] 
Standing 
remote 
from 
the 
legal 
profession 
I 
should 
not 
have 
ventured 
to 
declare 
that 
the 
study 
of 
Greek 
was 
not 
necessary 
for 
the 
jurists; 
yet 
this 
view 
was 
taken 
in 
the 
debate 
that 
followed 
this 
lecture 
by 
professional 
jurists 
of 
high 
standing. 
According 
to 
this 
opinion, 
the 
preparatory 
education 
obtained 
in 
the 
German 
Realgymnasium 
would 
also 
be 
sufficient 
for 
the 
future 
jurists 
and 
insufficient 
only 
for 
theologians 
and 
philologists. 
[In 
England 
and 
America 
not 
only 
is 
Greek 
not 
necessary, 
but 
the 
law-Latin 
is 
so 
peculiar 
that 
even 
persons 
of 
good 
classical 
education 
cannot 
understand 
it.—Tr.] 
[119] 
In 
emphasising 
here 
the 
weak 
sides 
of 
the 
writings 
of 
Plato 
and 
Aristotle, 
forced 
on 
my 
attention 
while 
reading 
them 
in 
German 
translations, 
I, 
of 
course, 
have 
no 
intention 
of 
underrating 
the 
great 
merits 
and 
the 
high 
historical 
importance 
of 
these 
two 
men. 
Their 
importance 
must 
not 
be 
measured 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
speculative 
philosophy 
still 
moves 
to 
a 
great 
extent 
in 
their 
paths 
of 
thought. 
The 
more 
probable 
conclusion 
is 
that 
this 
branch 
has 
made 
very 
little 
progress 
in 
the 
last 
two 
thousand 
years. 
Natural 
science 
also 
was 
implicated 
for 
centuries 
in 
the 
meshes 
of 
the 
Aristotelian 
thought, 
and 
owes 
its 
rise 
mainly 
to 
having 
thrown 
off 
those 
fetters. 
[120] 
I 
would 
not 
for 
a 
moment 
contend 
that 
we 
derive 
exactly 
the 
same 
profit 
from 
reading 
a 
Greek 
author 
in 
a 
translation 
as 
from 
reading 
him 
in 
the 
original; 
but 
the 
difference, 
the 
excess 
of 
gain 
in 
the 
second 
case, 
appears 
to 
me, 
and 
probably 
will 
to 
most 
men 
who 
are 
not 
professional 
philologists, 
to 
be 
too 
dearly 
bought 
with 
the 
expenditure 
of 
eight 
years 
of 
valuable 
time. 

[121] 
"The 
temptation," 
Judge 
Hartwich 
writes, 
"to 
regard 
the 
'taste' 
of 
the 
ancients 
as 
so 
lofty 
and 
unsurpassable 
appears 
to 
me 
to 
have 
its 
chief 
origin 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
ancients 
were 
unexcelled 
in 
the 
representation 
of 
the 
nude. 
First, 
by 
their 
unremitting 
care 
of 
the 
human 
body 
they 
produced 
splendid 
models; 
and 
secondly, 
in 
their 
gymnasiums 
and 
in 
their 
athletic 
games 
they 
had 
these 
models 
constantly 
before 
their 
eyes. 
No 
wonder, 
then, 
that 
their 
statues 
still 
excite 
our 
admiration! 
For 
the 
form, 
the 
ideal 
of 
the 
human 
body 
has 
not 
changed 
in 
the 
course 
of 
the 
centuries. 
But 
with 
intellectual 
matters 
it 
is 
totally 
different; 
they 
change 
from 
century 
to 
century, 
nay, 
from 
decennium 
to 
decennium. 
It 
is 
very 
natural 
now, 
that 
people 
should 
unconsciously 
apply 
what 
is 
thus 
so 
easily 
seen, 
namely, 
the 
works 
of 
sculpture, 
as 
a 
universal 
criterion 
of 
the 
highly 
developed 
taste 
of 
the 
ancients— 
a 
fallacy 
against 
which 
people 
cannot, 
in 
my 
judgment, 
be 
too 
strongly 
warned."

an

The 
choice 
is 
so 
easily 
made 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
question 
of 
difficulties. 
The 
contents 
would 
be 
discussed 
with 
the 
students, 
and 
the 
original 
experiments 
performed 
with 
them. 
Those 
scholars 
alone 
should 
receive 
this 
instruction 
in 
the 
upper 
classes 
who 
did 
not 
look 
forward 
to 
systematical 
instruction 
in

physical 
sciences. 
I 
do 
not 
make 
this 
proposition 
of 
reform 
here 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
I 
have 
no 
doubt, 
moreover, 
that 
such 
radical 
changes 
will 
only 
be 
slowly 
introduced.

Wrong 
as 
it 
is 
to 
burden 
future 
physicians 
and 
scientists 
with 
Greek 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
theologians 
and 
philologists, 
it 
would 
be 
just 
as 
wrong 
to 
compel 
theologians 
and 
philologists, 
on 
account 
of 
the 
physicians, 
to 
study 
such 
subjects 
as 
analytical 
geometry. 
Moreover, 
I 
cannot 
believe 
that 
ignorance 
of 
analytical 

geometry 
would 
be 
a 
serious 
hindrance 
to 
a

was

thought.
