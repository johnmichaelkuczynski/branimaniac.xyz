DR.

Analytic 
Truth 
vs. 
Formal 
Truth 



MAX: 
Dr. 
K, 
What 
is 
an 
analytic 
truth? 


Dr. 
K: 
One 
that 
holds 
entirely 
in 
virtue 
of 
its 
own 
content, 
for 
example: 
cubes 
are 
three-dimensional 
figures. 


MAX: 
So 
a 
truth 
is 
analytic 
if, 
given 
only 
what 
it 
says 
about 
the 
world, 
it 
could 
not 
possibly 
fail 
to 
be 
true. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 


MAX: 
So 
Dr. 
K. 
plays 
the 
piano 
is 
a 
non-analytic 
truth, 
since, 
even 
though 
it 
is 
true, 
its 
content---what 
it 
says 
about 
the 
world, 
in 
other 
words---does 
not 
by 
itself 
guarantee 
its 
truth. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
And 
triangles 
have 
three 
sides 
would 
be 
analytic, 
since, 
given 
only 
what 
it 
says, 
it 
could 
not 
fail 
to 
be 
true. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
That 
is 
an 
example, 
if 
only 
a 
rather 
trivial 
one. 


MAX: 
Do 
you 
mean 
that 
it’s 
a 
trivial 
example 
of 
an 
analytic 
truth, 
or 
that 
it 
is 
an 
example 
of 
a 
trivial 
analytic 
truth? 


Dr. 
K: 
Both. 


MAX: 
How 
about 
this? 
x 
is 
a 
triangle 
just 
in 
case 
x 
is 
a 
closed, 
planar, 
straight-edged 
three-sided 
figure 
such 
that 
any 
given 
two 
of 
its 
sides 
intersect 
but 
not 
all 
three 
of 
them 
intersect. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes, 
that 
is 
an 
example 
of 
a 
relatively 
non-trivial 
analytic 
truth. 
MAX: 
So 
an 
analytic 
truth 
isn’t 
exactly 
a 
definitional 
truth. 
An 
analytic 
truth 



is 
one 
that 
holds 
entirely 
in 
virtue 
of 
considerations 
of 
logic 
and 
meaning. 
Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 
MAX: 
And 
an 
analytic 
truth 
may 
therefore 
be 
utterly 
non-trivial. 
Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
It 
sounds 
as 
though 
you 
have 
an 
example 
in 
mind. 
MAX: 
I 
do. 
To 
wit, 
there 
are 
continuous 
functions 
that 
cannot 
be 


differentiated 
at 
any 
given 
point. 


Dr. 
K: 
That 
is 
indeed 
analytic, 
and 
it 
is 
utterly 
non-trivial. 
MAX: 
What 
is 
a 
tautology? 
Dr. 
K: 
A 
definitional 
truth. 
MAX: 
I 
see. 
So 
‘a 
bachelor 
is 
an 
unmarried 
man’ 
is 
a 
tautology. 
Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
MAX: 
So 
all 
tautologies 
are 
analytic, 
but 
not 
all 
analytic 
truths 
are 


tautologies. 
Dr. 
K: 
Not 
exactly. 
MAX: 
Explain. 
Dr. 
K: 
Take 
your 
example: 
‘a 
bachelor 
is 
an 
unmarried 
man.’ 
The 
meaning 
of 


that 
statement 
is: 
The 
word 
‘bachelor’ 
has 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 
the 
expression 
‘unmarried 
man.’ 
Which 
is 
not 
analytic, 
since 
it 
is 
an 
empirical 
truth 
about 
language. 


MAX: 
Please 
clarify 
that 
last 
point. 
Dr. 
K: 
It 
isn’t 
a 
matter 
of 
logic 
that 
‘bachelor’ 
has 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 
‘unmarried 
man.’ 
Those 
expressions 
could 
mean 
anything. 
It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 



empirical 
fact, 
of 
historical 
happenstance, 
that 
they 
have 
the 
meanings 
that 
they 
do 
in 
fact 
have. 


MAX: 
I 
see. 
It 
is 
incoherent 
to 
deny 
that 
triangles 
have 
three 
sides. 
It 
is 
incoherent---not 
obviously 
incoherent, 
perhaps, 
but 
incoherent 
nonetheless--to 
deny 
that 
a 
triangle 
is 
a 
three-sided, 
straight-edged 
figure 
any 
given 
two 
of 
whose 
sides 
intersect 
but 
not 
all 
three 
sides 
of 
its 
intersect. 
It 
is 
incoherent--not 
by 
any 
means 
obviously 
incoherent, 
surely, 
but 
still 
incoherent---to 
deny 
that 
there 
are 
continuous 
functions 
that 
cannot 
be 
differentiated 
at 
any 
point. 
But 
one 
could 
coherently---not 
correctly, 
but 
coherently---deny 
that 
‘bachelor’ 
has 
the 
same 
meaning 
as 
‘adult 
unmarried 
man.’ 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
That 
is 
why 
‘a 
bachelor 
is 
an 
unmarried 
man’ 
is 
an 
empirical 
truth, 
whereas 
the 
others 
that 
you 
mentioned 
are 
non-empirical, 
striclty 
analytic 
truths. 


MAX: 
So 
the 
old 
saying 
that 
analytic 
truths 
are 
tautologies 
is 
wrong. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
Very 
wrong. 


MAX: 
Because, 
in 
actuality, 
no 
analytic 
truths 
are 
tautologies. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
Because 
a 
tautology 
is 
a 
definitional 
truth. 
It 
is 
a 
definition, 
or 
partial 
definition, 
in 
other 
words. 
And 
definitions 
hold 
in 
virtue 
of 
contingent, 
non-
analytic 
facts 
about 
how 
words 
are 
used. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly, 
if 
a 
given 
word 
is 
used 
in 
a 
given 
way, 
that 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
brute 
historical 
fact. 
It 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
analytic 
relations 
among 
concepts. 


MAX: 
Are 
all 
mathematicall 
truths 
identical 
with 
analytic 
truths? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 


MAX: 
Are 
all 
analytic 
truths 
identical 
with 
mathematical 
truths? 



Dr. 
K: 
No. 
MAX: 
Explain. 
Dr. 
K: 
Consider 
the 
statement 


(1) 
all 
mathematical 
truths 
are 
analytic 
truths. 
Question: 
Is 
(1) 
true? 
MAX: 
Yes. 
You 
just 
said 
so. 
Dr. 
K: 
Is 
(1) 
analytic? 
MAX: 
Yes. 
Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
But 
I 
would 
like 
to 
hear 
your 
reasoning. 
MAX: 
1+1=2 
is 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics 
and 
it 
is 
therefore 
analytic. 
If 
it 
were 
an 
empirical 
fact 
that 
1+1=2, 
then 
(1) 
would 
be 
false. 
Since 
(1) 
is 
true, 
it 
follows 
that 
1+1=2 
is 
a 
non-empirical, 
analytic 
truth. 
In 
general, 
if 
a 
truth 
is 
analytic, 
it 
is 
analytic 
that 
it 
is 
analytic. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
what 
you 
just 
said, 
Max, 
let 
us 
once 
again 
consider 
(1). 
We 
have 
agreed 
that 
it 
is 
and 
also 
that 
it 
is 
analytic. 
MAX: 
That’s 
right. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
But 
is 
(1) 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics? 
MAX: 
No. 
(1) 
is 
a 
truth 
about 
mathematics. 
It 
is 
not 
itself 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
(1) 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
mathematics, 
even 
though 
it 
concerns 
mathematics. 



MAX: 
And 
even 
though 
it 
follows 
from 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics. 
Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right, 
Max. 
MAX: 
Sir, 
before 
we 
continue, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
summarize 
the 
argument 
that 


we 
must 
went 
through, 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
I 
really 
understand 
it. 
Dr. 
K: 
Good 
idea. 
Proceed. 
MAX: 
Let 
(a) 
be 
the 
statement: 
1+1=2 
And 
let 
(b) 
be 
the 
statement: 
1+1=2 
is 
analytic. 


(a) 
is 
analytic, 
and 
(a) 
is 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics. 
(b) 
is 
also 
analytic, 
but 
(b) 
is 
not 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics. 
(b) 
is 
a 
philosophical, 
not 
a 
mathematical, 
statement 
as 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
mathematical 
truth. 
Any 
given 
mathematical 
truth 
is 
analytic. 
It 
follows 
that 
(1) 
is 
analytic, 
where 
(1) 
is 
the 
statement: 
All 
mathematical 
truths 
are 
analytic 
truths 


But 
(1) 
is 
not 
itself 
a 
truth 
of 
mathematics. 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
stated 
the 
argument 
perfectly. 


MAX: 
Good, 
but 
I 
have 
a 
question. 
According 
to 
a 
friend 
of 
mine, 
Kurt 
Gödel 
proved 
that 
the 
truths 
of 
mathematics 
are 
not 
analytic. 


Dr. 
K: 
That 
is 
not 
what 
Gödel 
proved. 
That 
is 
the 
opposite 
of 
what 
he 
proved, 
in 
fact. 
But 
before 
I 
tell 
you 
why, 
I 
would 
like 
to 
hear 
what 
else 
this 
friend 
of 
yours 
told 
you. 



MAX: 
According 
to 
this 
person, 
Bertrand 
Russell 
and 
Alfred 
North 
Whitehead 
tried 
to 
prove 
that 
all 
mathematical 
truths 
are 
tautologies, 
and 
Godel 
proved 
them 
wrong. 


Dr. 
K: 
Did 
this 
friend 
of 
your 
say 
anything 
else? 


MAX: 
That 
when 
people 
refer 
to 
Gödel’s 
Proof, 
this 
is 
what 
they 
are 
referring 
to. 


Dr. 
K: 
Ok. 
Russell 
and 
Whitehead 
tried 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
class 
of 
arithmetical 
truths 
is 
recursively 
definable. 
Gödel 
proved 
that 
it 
is 
not 
recursively 
definable. 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
a 
recursive 
definition 
is? 


MAX: 
Yes. 
First 
of 
all, 
a 
recursive 
definition 
is 
always 
a 
definition 
of 
a 
class. 


Dr. 
K. 
That’s 
right. 


MAX: 
Given 
a 
class 
k, 
a 
recursive 
definition 
of 
k 
is 
a 
true 
statement 
of 
the 
form 


alpha 
belongs 
to 
k, 
phi 
of 
x 
belongs 
to 
k 
whenever 
x 
belongs 
to 
k, 
and 
nothing 
else 
belongs 
to 
k 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
Suppose 
that 
k 
is 
the 
class 
of 
natural 
numbers. 
Please 
recursively 
define 
k. 


MAX: 
0 
belongs 
to 
k. 
if 
n 
belongs 
to 
k, 
so 
does 
n+1. 
And 
nothing 
else 
belongs 
to 
k. 


Dr. 
K: 
Good. 
k 
is 
the 
smallest 
class 
containing 
0 
and 
containing 
the 
successor 
of 
anything 
that 
it 
contains. 


MAX: 
I 
like 
that 
way 
of 
putting 
it. 



Dr. 
K: 
Notice 
that 
the 
members 
of 
the 
class 
of 
natural 
numbers 
can 
be 
arranged 
in 
a 
progression. 


MAX: 
You 
mean, 
they 
can 
be 
arranged 
in 
a 
discrete 
series 
that 
has 
a 
first 
member 
and 
no 
last 
member. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
this 
is 
true 
of 
all 
recursively 
definable 
classes. 


MAX: 
That 
makes 
sense. 
Given 
any 
class 
k, 
a 
recursive 
definition 
of 
k 
has 
the 
form 


Alpha 
belongs 
to 
k; 
If 
x 
belongs 
to 
k, 
then 
phi 
of 
x 
also 
belongs 
to 
k, 
and 
Nothing 
else 
belongs 
to 
k. 


So 
if 
we 
want 
to 
arrange 
the 
members 
of 
k 
as 
a 
progression, 
we 
just 
start 
with 
alpha. 
Alpha 
is 
the 
first 
member 
of 
the 
progression, 
in 
other 
words. 
Then 
we 
put 
phi 
of 
alpha. 
Which 
is 
the 
second 
member. 
Then 
we 
put 
phi 
of 
phi 
of 
alpha. 
Which 
is 
the 
third. 
And 
so 
on. 
And 
every 
member 
of 
k 
is 
somewhere 
on 
that 
list. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
phi 
is 
a 
recursive 
function 
if 
it 
satisfies 
the 
following 
two 
conditons. 
First, 
phi 
is 
defined 
for 
each 
of 
its 
own 
ouputs. 
Second, 
there 
is 
some 
object 
x 
such 
that 
x 
is 
one 
of 
phi’s 
inputs 
but 
x 
is 
not 
one 
of 
phi’s 
outputs. 
Do 
you 
follow? 


MAX: 
Yes. 
The 
first 
condition 
guarantees 
that 
phi 
of 
x 
can 
be 
iterated 
infinitely 
many 
times, 
and 
second 
condition 
guarantees 
that 
the 
subsequent 
series 
does 
not 
loop. 


Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 
Now, 
suppose 
that 
k 
is 
a 
statement-class. 


MAX: 
You 
mean, 
a 
class 
that 
contains 
statements, 
as 
opposed 
to 
numbers. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
suppose 
that 
k 
is 
recursively 
defined. 
Do 
you 
follow, 
Max? 
Can 
you 
give 
me 
an 
example 
of 
a 
recursively 
defined 
statement-class? 



MAX: 
Yes. 
Let 
k 
be 
the 
smallest 
class 
that 
contains 
the 
statement 
snow 
is 
white 
and 
that, 
whenever 
it 
contains 
a 
statement, 
also 
contains 
the 
statement 
p 
and 
p. 
in 
that 
case, 
k 
is 
the 
smallest 
class 
containing: 


Snow 
is 
white, 
Snow 
is 
white 
and 
snow 
is 
white, 
Snow 
is 
white 
and 
snow 
is 
white 
and 
snow 
is 
white, 
and 
so 
on. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
Now 
suppose 
we 
replace 
S 
with 
some 
very 
obvious 
truth 
of 
arithmetic, 
such 
as 
1+0=1. 


MAX: 
In 
that 
case, 
k 
is 
a 
recursively 
defined 
class 
of 
arithmetical 
truths. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
And 
what 
Russell 
and 
Whitehead 
tried 
to 
show 
is 
that, 
given 
the 
right 
choice 
of 
S 
and 
the 
right 
choice 
of 
phi, 
the 
resulting 
class 
contains 
every 
truth 
of 
arithmetic. 


MAX: 
And 
this 
is 
what 
Gödel 
proved 
to 
be 
false. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 
He 
proved 
that 
there 
is 
no 
recursive 
definition 
of 
the 
class 
of 
truths 
of 
arithmetic. 


MAX: 
So 
he 
proved 
that, 
for 
any 
statement 
S 
and 
any 
recursive 
function 
phi, 
at 
least 
one 
truth 
of 
arithmetic 
is 
absent 
from 
the 
following 
series: 


S 
phi 
of 
S 
phi 
of 
phi 
of 
S 
phi 
of 
phis 
of 
phi 
of 
S 


And 
so 
on 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
That 
is 
exactly 
what 
he 
proved. 


MAX: 
So 
he 
proved 
that 
there 
is 
no 
algorithm---no 
purely 
formal 
procedure--
for 
generating 
all 
of 
the 
truths 
of 
arithmetic. 



Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
So 
he 
proved 
that 
there 
is 
purely 
formal 
characteristic 
that 


distinguishes 
the 
truths 
of 
arithmetic 
from 
other 
truths. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
But 
the 
truths 
of 
arithmetic 
are 
analytic. 


MAX: 
So 
they 
are 
analytic, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
formally 
true. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
So 
what 
Gödel 
proved 
is 
that 
the 
truths 
of 
arithmetic 
are 
analytically 


true 
but 
not 
formally 
true. 
Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
MAX: 
So 
my 
friend 
was 
wrong. 
Dr. 
K: 
Very. 
MAX: 
And 
you 
will 
tell 
me 
how 
Gödel 
proved 
this? 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
will. 
But 
not 
now. 
We 
have 
quite 
a 
few 
bridges 
to 
cross 
before 
we 


can 
discuss 
the 
specifics 
of 
Gödel’s 
proof. 
MAX: 
What 
about 
the 
non-specifics? 
What 
is 
the 
general 
idea? 
Can 
you 
give 


me 
at 
least 
a 
vague 
idea 
of 
what 
it 
is 
that 
he 
proved 
and, 
possible, 
of 
how 
he 
proved? 
Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
I 
can 
do 
that. 
First 
of 
all, 
incompleteness 
is 
a 
property 
of 


statement-sets---of 
sets 
of 
statements, 
in 
other 
words. 
MAX: 
I 
follow. 



Dr. 
K: 
And 
to 
say 
that 
a 
statement-set 
is 
incomplete 
is 
to 
say 
that 
there 
is 
no 
recursive 
definition 
of 
it. 


MAX: 
And 
to 
say 
that 
a 
statement-set 
is 
complete 
is 
to 
say 
that 
there 
is 
a 
recursive 
definition 
of 
it. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
So, 
if 
k 
is 
the 
set 
of 
truths 
of 
the 
form, 
x 
is 
a 
natural 
number, 
then 
k 
is 
complete, 
since 
it 
is 
generated 
by 
the 
following 
recursion: 


x 
belongs 
to 
k 
if 
x 
= 
0; 
x 
belongs 
to 
k 
if 
y 
belongs 
to 
k 
and 
x=y+1; 
otherwise, 
x 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
k 


Dr. 
K: 
Spot 
on. 


MAX: 
But 
I 
cannot 
think 
of 
an 
example 
of 
an 
incomplete 
statement-set. 


Dr. 
K: 
Most 
scientifically 
important 
statement-sets 
are 
incompletely. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
axiomatize---in 
other 
words, 
to 
recursively 
define---statementsets 
that 
have 
any 
real 
scope 
or 
explanatory 
power. 


MAX: 
Could 
you 
please 
give 
me 
an 
example? 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
will 
give 
you 
the 
simplest 
example 
that 
I 
can 
think. 
But 
it 
is 
also 
the 
most 
important 
example 
that 
I 
can 
think 
of, 
and 
Godel’s 
own 
incompleteness-
theorem, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
technique 
he 
used 
to 
prove 
it 
is 
based 
on 
the 
theorem 
I 
am 
about 
to 
say. 


MAX: 
What 
is 
the 
statement-set 
in 
question? 


Dr. 
K: 
The 
set 
of 
all 
statements 
of 
the 
form 
x 
is 
a 
real 
numbe. 
Let 
R 
be 
that 
statement-set. 
There 
is 
no 
recursive 
definition 
of 
R. 


MAX: 
I 
suppose 
that 
makes 
sense. 
If 
there 
were 
such 
a 
statement-set, 
then 
the 
real 
numbers 
could 
be 
represented 
as 
a 
discrete 
series. 
Since 
that 
is 
not 



possible, 
that 
statement-set 
is 
incomplete. 
Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 
But 
let 
me 
state 
the 
proof. 
Once 
I 
do 
so, 
some 
interesting 


and 
profound, 
but 
also 
quite 
counterintuitive, 
mathematical 
truths 
will 
become 
comprehensible 
to 
you. 
MAX: 
I 
am 
listening 
with 
rapt 
interest, 
Dr. 
K! 
Dr. 
K: 
Good. 
First 
of 
all, 
any 
real 
number 
can 
be 
expressed 
as 
an 
infinitely 


long 
series 
of 
integers. 
Thus, 
the 
number 
1 
is 
identical 
with 
point 
9 
9 
9 
9 
9 
9 
repeating 
And 
the 
number 
2 
is 
identical 
with: 
one 
point 
9 
9 
9 
9 
9 
repeating. 
And 
so 
on. 
MAX: 
That’s 
right. 


Dr. 
K: 
Bearing 
this 
in 
mind, 
let 
L 
be 
a 
list 
of 
real 
numbers, 
expressed 
as 
infinitely 
long 
series 
of 
integers. 


MAX: 
So 
the 
first 
member 
of 
L 
is 
one 
infinitely 
long 
series 
of 
integers; 
then, 
right 
belong 
that, 
there 
is 
another 
such 
series; 
and, 
right 
below 
that, 
is 
a 
third 
such 
series. 
And 
so 
on. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
L 
is 
a 
top-down 
list, 
and 
each 
entry 
on 
the 
list 
is 
a 
real 
number, 
expressed 
as 
an 
infinitely 
long 
integer 
series. 


MAX: 
And 
L 
is 
arbitrarily 
chosen. 
In 
other 
words, 
L 
can 
be 
as 
inclusive 
a 
list 
of 
real 
numbers 
as 
we 
want 
it 
to 
be. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
Are 
you 
ready 
to 
take 
the 
next 
step, 
Max? 



MAX: 
Yes. 


Dr. 
K: 
Let 
D 
be 
a 
function 
that 
does 
the 
following. 
And 
here 
you 
have 
to 
listen 
very 
carefully. 
If 
the 
nth 
figure 
in 
the 
nth 
member 
of 
L 
is 
9, 
then 
D 
replaces 
that 
figure 
with 
1. 
And 
if 
that 
figure 
is 
less 
than 
9, 
then 
D 
adds 
1 
to 
it. 
Do 
you 
follow, 
Max? 


MAX: 
I 
think 
so. 
Suppose 
that 
the 
first 
integer 
in 
the 
first 
member 
of 
L 
is 
9. 
In 
that 
case, 
D 
replaces 
that 
integer 
with 
1. 
And 
suppose 
that 
the 
second 
integer 
in 
the 
second 
member 
of 
L 
is 
4. 
In 
that 
case, 
D 
replaces 
that 
integer 
with 
5. 
And 
if 
the 
third 
integer 
in 
the 
third 
member 
of 
L 
is 
2, 
then 
D 
replaces 
that 
integer 
with 
3. 
And 
so 
on, 
for 
each 
entry 
on 
L. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
You 
will 
notice 
that 
D 
generates 
an 
infinitely 
long 
series 
of 
integers. 


MAX: 
Right. 
If 
the 
first 
integer 
in 
the 
first 
member 
of 
L 
is 
n, 
and 
n 
is 
less 
than 
9, 
then 
the 
first 
integer 
in 
D 
of 
L 
is 
n+1. 
If 
n 
equals 
9, 
then 
D 
replaces 
n 
with 
1. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
What 
about 
the 
second 
member 
of 
L? 


MAX: 
If 
n 
is 
the 
second 
integer 
in 
the 
second 
member 
of 
L, 
and 
n 
is 
less 
than 
9, 
then 
D 
replaces 
with 
n 
with 
n+1. 
If 
n 
equals 
9, 
then 
D 
replaces 
n 
with 
1. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
the 
third 
member? 


MAX: 
If 
n 
is 
the 
third 
integer 
in 
the 
third 
member 
of 
L, 
and 
n 
is 
less 
than 
9, 
then 
D 
replaces 
with 
n 
with 
n+1. 
If 
n 
equals 
9, 
then 
D 
replaces 
n 
with 
1. 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
clearly 
understand, 
Max. 
I 
am 
now 
going 
to 
ask 
you 
a 
difficult 
question. 


MAX: 
I 
am 
ready. 


Dr. 
K: 
Is 
D 
of 
L 
itself 
a 
member 
of 
L? 
In 
other 
words, 
is 
D 
of 
L 
one 
of 
the 
numbers 
listed 
on 
L? 



MAX: 
No, 
it 
is 
not. 
D 
of 
L 
is 
different 
from 
the 
first 
entry 
on 
L, 
since 
the 
first 
integer 
in 
the 
first 
entry 
is 
different 
from 
the 
first 
integer 
in 
D 
of 
L. 
And 
D 
of 
L 
is 
different 
from 
the 
second 
entry 
on 
L, 
since 
the 
second 
integer 
in 
the 
first 
entry 
is 
different 
from 
the 
second 
integer 
in 
D 
of 
L. 
And 
for 
any 
number 
y, 
the 
yth 
integer 
in 
the 
yth 
entry 
on 
L 
is 
different 
from 
the 
yth 
entry 
in 
D 
of 
L. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
Therefore, 
D 
of 
L 
differs 
from 
each 
of 
the 
entries 
on 
L, 
and 
D 
of 
L 
therefore 
does 
not 
itself 
occur 
on 
L. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
L 
is 
an 
arbitrary 
list 
of 
real 
numbers. 
It 
could 
any 
list 
of 
real 
numbers, 
even 
an 
infinitely 
long 
one. 
No 
matter 
how 
long 
we 
make 
L, 
D 
of 
L 
is 
not 
on 
L. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
am 
going 
to 
ask 
you 
another 
question, 
Max. 
If 
a 
class 
is 
recursively 
definable, 
can 
its 
members 
be 
listed? 


MAX: 
Yes. 
If 
k 
is 
recursively 
definable, 
then 
there 
exists 
some 
object 
alpha, 
and 
some 
recursion 
phi, 
such 
that 
alpha 
belongs 
to 
k 
and 
such 
that, 
if 
x 
belongs 
to 
k, 
so 
does 
phi 
of 
x. 
So 
we 
can 
make 
a 
list 
that 
contains 
every 
member 
of 
k. 
We 
put 
alpha 
first; 
and 
we 
put 
phi 
of 
alpha 
second; 
and 
we 
put 
phi 
of 
phi 
of 
alpha 
third; 
and 
so 
on. 
And 
there 
is 
no 
member 
that 
does 
not 
occur 
on 
this 
list. 
Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 
And 
if 
there 
is 
no 
way 
to 
make 
a 
list 
out 
of 
k’s 
member, 
what 
follows? 


MAX: 
That 
k 
is 
not 
recursively 
definable. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
So 
the 
class 
of 
real 
numbers 
is 
not 
recursively 
definable. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
And 
the 
same 
is 
therefore 
of 
the 
class 
of 
true 
statements 
of 



the 
form 
x 
is 
a 
real 
number. 


MAX: 
I 
see. 
So 
if 
S 
is 
that 
class, 
then 
S 
is 
incomplete, 
meaning 
that 
there 
is 
no 
recursive 
definition 
of 
it. 


Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 


MAX: 
And 
Godel’s 
theorem 
about 
arithmetic 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
incompleteness-theorem 
that 
you 
just 
stated. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes, 
and 
his 
method 
of 
proof 
is 
based 
on 
the 
technique 
that 
we 
just 
used, 
which 
is 
known 
as 
diagonalization. 


MAX: 
Why 
is 
it 
called 
that? 


Dr. 
K: 
D 
of 
L 
starts 
at 
the 
top 
left 
of 
L. 
It 
replaces 
the 
first 
integer 
in 
the 
first 
member 
of 
L 
with 
some 
other 
integers. 
Then 
it 
moves 
down 
one 
entry, 
and 
one 
decimal 
place 
to 
the 
right. 
And 
it 
replaces 
the 
second 
integer 
in 
the 
second 
entry 
on 
L. 
And 
so 
on. 


MAX: 
I 
see. 
So 
D 
of 
L 
generates 
a 
perfectly 
diagonal 
path, 
from 
the 
very 
top 
left 
of 
L, 
that 
moves 
downards, 
and 
to 
the 
right. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
Let 
lambda 
is 
some 
list 
of 
objects, 
and 
suppose 
that 
each 
of 
entries 
in 
lambda 
is 
itself 
a 
list. 


MAX: 
So 
lambda 
is 
just 
like 
L. 
L 
was 
a 
list. 
And 
each 
entry 
on 
L 
was 
itself 
a 
list, 
since 
each 
entry 
was 
a 
series, 
and 
therefore 
a 
list, 
of 
integers. 


Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 
And 
then 
define 
a 
functoin 
delta 
such 
that, 
if 
x 
is 
the 
first 
member 
of 
the 
first 
member 
of 
lambda, 
then 
delta 
replaces 
x 
with 
y, 
where 
y 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
x; 
and, 
if 
z 
is 
the 
second 
member 
of 
the 
second 
member 
of 
lambda, 
then 
delta 
replaces 
z 
with 
w, 
where 
w 
is 
not 
identical 
with 
z. 
And 
so 
on, 
for 
each 
of 
the 
entries 
on 
lambda. 


MAX: 
In 
that 
case, 
delta 
generates 
a 
list 
of 
objects, 
delta 
of 
lambda. 
And 
delta 
of 
lambda 
is 
not 
itself 
on 
one 
of 
the 
items 
listed 
on 
lambda. 



Dr. 
K: 
Right.And 
delta 
of 
lambda 
a 
diagonalization 
of 
lambda. 
MAX: 
So 
suppose 
somebody 
says, 
‘lambda 
is 
a 
complete 
list 
of 
objects 


having 
property 
phi.’ 
And 
suppose 
that 
delta 
of 
has 
phi. 
In 
that 
case, 
that 
person 
is 
wrong. 
Dr. 
K: 
And 
we 
have 
proved 
the 
incompleteness 
of 
lambda 
by 
diagonalizaing 


on 
it. 
MAX: 
Do 
all 
proofs 
of 
incompleteness 
involve 
diagonalization? 
Dr. 
K: 
No. 
Godel’s 
proof 
uses 
a 
very 
exotic 
form 
of 
it. 
But 
the 
proof 
I 
am 


about 
to 
state, 
of 
which 
Gödel’s 
proof 
is 
a 
corollary, 
does 
not 
involve 
diagonalization. 
MAX: 
So 
you 
have 
proved 
an 
incompleteness-theorem 
of 
your 
own. 
Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
MAX: 
And 
that 
theorem 
is 
related 
to 
Gödel’s 
theorem? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
Gödel’s 
theorem 
follows 
from 
it. 
MAX: 
But 
your 
theorem, 
as 
well 
your 
proof, 
are 
presumably 
easier 
to 
understand 
than 
Gödeltheorem? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
Dramatically. 
MAX: 
I 
am 
all 
ears, 
Sir! 
Dr. 
K: 
A 
logic---a 
system 
of 
logic, 
in 
other 
words---is 
simply 
a 
recursively 


defined 
statement-set. 
MAX: 
I 
think 
I 
understand. 
A 
logic 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
an 
axiomatic 
system, 
and 
an 
axiomatic 
system 
is 
a 
recursively 
defined 
statement-set. 



Dr. 
K: 
And 
in 
other 
audio, 
you 
and 
I 
will 
tell 
our 
listeners 
what 
an 
axiomatic 
system 
is. 


MAX: 
Agreed. 
Dr. 
K: 
Let 
me 
ask 
you 
a 
question, 
Max. 
Is 
the 
class 
of 
all 
recursively 
defined 
statement-sets 
itself 
a 
recursively 
defined 
statement? 


MAX: 
I 
want 
to 
make 
sure 
I 
understand 
the 
question, 
Sir. 
. 
A 
logic 
is 
by 
definition 
a 
recursively 
defined 
set 
of 
statements. 
So 
any 
given 
logic 
is, 
by 
definition, 
recursively 
defined. 
But 
is 
the 
class 
of 
all 
logics 
itself 
recursively 
defined? 
That 
is 
what 
you 
are 
asking, 
am 
I 
right? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
MAX: 
I 
don’t 
know 
the 
answer 
to 
that 
question, 
Sir. 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
will 
answer 
it 
for 
you, 
then. 
Let 
L1 
be 
an 
arbitrary 
logic---an 


arbitrarily 
recursively 
defined 
statement-in 
other 
words. 
MAX: 
Ok. 
Dr. 
K: 
And 
let 
S 
be 
some 
statement 
that 
does 
not 
belong 
to 
L1. 
MAX: 
Ok. 
Dr. 
K: 
And 
let 
L2 
the 
same 
as 
L1, 
except 
that 
S 
is 
a 
member 
of 
L2. 
MAX: 
I 
see. 
So 
S 
belongs 
to 
L2, 
but 
not 
to 
L1. 
But 
otherwise 
L1 
and 
L2 
are 


the 
same. 
Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
Is 
L2 
recursively 
definable. 
MAX: 
Yes. 
L1 
is 
recursive, 
by 
supposition. 
So 
it 
is 
generated 
by 
some 


statement 
of 
the 
form: 


sigma 
belongs 
to 
L1, 
and, 
if 
zeta 
belongs 
to 
L1, 
does 
phi 
of 
zeta. 



It 
follows 
that 
L2 
is 
generated 
by 
the 
statement: 
S 
belongs 
to 
L2, 
and, 
if 
zeta 
belongs 
to 
L2, 
so 
does 
psi 
of 
zeta, 
where 
psi 
is 
just 
like 
phi, 
except 
that 
psi 
of 
S 
equals 
sigma. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly, 
Max. 
Exactly. 
So 
L2 
contains 
S; 
and 
it 
contains 
psi 
of 
S, 
which 
is 
sigma, 
and 
it 
contains 
psi 
of 
psi 
of 
S; 
and 
so 
on. 


MAX: 
So 
L2 
is 
recursively 
defined, 
and 
so 
is 
L1. 
But 
the 
recursion 
that 
generates 
L1 
fails 
to 
generate 
L2. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
L1 
was 
an 
arbitrarily 
chosen 
statement 
class. 


MAX: 
Ah! 
So 
if 
L1 
is 
supposed, 
for 
argument’s 
sake, 
to 
be 
a 
recursive 
definition 
of 
the 
class 
of 
all 
recursively 
defined 
statement-sets, 
then 
we 
can 
produce 
another 
recursively 
statement-set, 
by 
doing 
what 
we 
just 
did 
a 
moment 
ago 
with 
S. 
Which 
means 
that 
L1 
is 
not 
a 
recursive 
definition 
of 
the 
class 
of 
all 
recursively 
defined 
statement-sets. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
The 
assumption 
that 
there 
is 
a 
recursive 
definition 
of 
the 
class 
of 
all 
recursively 
defined 
statement-sets 
self-refutes. 


MAX: 
Which 
means 
that 
there 
is 
no 
definition 
of 
the 
class 
of 
all 
recursively 
defined 
statement-sets. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
Which 
means 
that 
there 
is 
no 
recursive 
definition 
of 
the 
class 
of 
systems 
of 
logic. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
Which 
means 
that 
there 
is 
no 
recursive 
characterization 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
logical 
truth. 



Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
MAX: 
Which 
means 
that 
the 
class 
of 
truths 
of 
logic 
is 
incomplete. 
Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
MAX: 
Which 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
more 
general, 
and 
perhaps 
more 
significant 


in 
other 
ways, 
than 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
class 
of 
arithmetical 
truths 
is 
incomplete. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree. 
But 
we 
can 
use 
the 
method 
of 
proof 
that 
we 
just 
used, 
in 
our 
proof 
of 
the 
incompleteness 
of 
logic, 
to 
prove 
Gödel’s 
theorem. 
MAX: 
How’s 
that? 
Dr. 
K: 
Let 
k 
be 
an 
arbitrary 
class 
of 
arithmetical 
truths. 
If 
we 
can 
figure 
out 
a 


way 
to 
identify 
so 
much 
as 
a 
single 
truth 
of 
arithmetic 
that 
does 
not 
belong 
to 


k, 
then 
k 
is 
incomplete. 
MAX: 
Ah! 
Very 
good! 
And 
since 
k 
is 
arbitrarily 
chosen---since, 
in 
other 
words, 
k 
is 
any 
given 
class 
of 
arithmetical 
truths---it 
follows 
that 
arithmetic 
is 
incomplete. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
that 
is 
what 
Gödel 
did. 
He 
proved 
that, 
given 
any 
class 
k 
of 
arithmetical 
truths, 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
construct 
a 
truth 
of 
arithmetic 
not 
belonging 
to 
k. 


MAX: 
And 
I 
want 
to 
hear 
all 
about, 
but 
I 
don’t 
think 
I 
can 
handle 
any 
more 
information 
today, 
Sir. 
Dr. 
K: 
Then 
let’s 
adjourn. 
See 
you 
tomorrow, 


A 
Priori 
Knowledge 


MAX: 
Dr. 
K. 
What 
is 
a 
priori 
knowledge? 



Dr. 
K: 
It 
is 
knowledge 
that 
is 
constitutive 
of 
one’s 
ability 
to 
reason 
and 
to 
learn 
from 
sensory 
experience. 


MAX: 
So 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
is 
knowledge 
that 
enables 
you 
to 
learn 
from 
experience 
and 
therefore 
is 
not 
itself 
acquired 
through 
experience. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


MAX: 
What 
proof 
is 
there 
that 
we 
have 
such 
knowledge? 


Dr. 
K: 
We 
couldn’t 
learn 
anything 
from 
experience, 
even 
the 
the 
most 
rudimentary 
truth, 
unless 
we 
have 
such 
knowledge. 
Therefore, 
we 
have 
such 
knowledge. 


MAX: 
Please 
clarify. 


Dr. 
K: 
First 
of 
all, 
for 
Q 
to 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
P 
is 
for 
not-Q 
to 
be 
incompatible 
with 
P. 
Do 
you 
follow? 


MAX: 
Yes. 
x 
has

because

is 
incompatible 
with

Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 
And 
if 
you 
can’t 
see 
that 
certain 
things 
follow 
from 
certain 
things, 
you 
can’t 
learn 
anything. 


MAX: 
I 
will 
grant 
that 
provisionally, 
so 
as 
to 
let 
you 
complete 
your 
argument. 
But 
I 
question 
it. 


Dr. 
K: 
Very 
well. 
Sensory 
observation 
apprises 
you 
of 
what 
is, 
not 
of 
what 


isn’t, 
and 
certainly 
not 
of 
what 
cannot 
possibly 
be. 


MAX: 
True. 


Dr. 
K: 
Therefore, 
observation 
doesn’t 
apprise 
you 
of 
truths 
of 
the 
form 
P 


is 
incompatible 
with 
Q. 


MAX: 
Explain. 



Dr. 
K: 
For 
P 
to 
be 
incompatible 
with 
Q 
is 
for 
it 
to 
impossible 
for 
P 
and 
not-Q 
to 
be 
jointly 
actual. 
Only 
actualities 
can 
be 
observed. 
Impossibilities 
must 
be 
deduced. 


MAX: 
So 
observation 
can’t 
tell 
you 
what 
is 
incompatible 
with 
what. 


Dr. 
K: 
Therefore, 
it 
cannot 
tell 
you 
what 
follows 
from 
what. 


Max: 
Now 
I 
see. 
For 
Q 
to 
be 
follow 
from 
P 
is 
for 
not-Q 
to 
be 
incompatible 


with 
P. 
So 
if 
you 
don’t 
what 
is 
incompatible 
with 
what, 
you 
don’t 
know 
what 
follows 
from 
what. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
And 
if 
you 
don’t 
know 
what 
follows 
from 
what, 
you 
can’t 
deduce 
anything. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 


MAX: 
But 
couldn’t 
you 
deduce 
the 
relevant 
principles 
from 
sensory 
experience? 


Dr. 
K: 
Because 
that 
would 
itself 
involve 
deduction! 


MAX: 
Ah! 
I 
didn’t 
think 
of 
that. 
But 
it 
makes 
sense. 
If 
I 
can’t 
deduce 
specifics 
from 
specifics, 
then 
I 
certainly 
cannot 
deduce 
how 
to 
deduce 
specifics 
from 
specifics…from 
specifics. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 


MAX: 
A 
creature 
that 
cannot 
see 
bearing 
relations 
among 
specific 
truths 
cannot 
see 
bearing 
realtions 
among 
bearing 
relations. 


Dr. 
K: 
A 
creature 
cannot 
acquire 
knowledge 
of 
any 
sort 
of 
bearing 
relations 
unless 
it 
already 
has 
such 
knowledge. 



MAX: 
So 
a 
creature 
that 
doesn’t 
have 
such 
knowledge 
ab 
initio 
cannot 
acquire 
more 
such 
knowledge. 


Dr. 
K. 
Right. 
Such 
a 
creature 
could 
not 
learn 
how 
to 
reason 
better, 
since 
it 
could 
not 
reason 
in 
the 
first 
place. 


MAX: 
And 
given 
that 
we 
can 
learn 
how 
to 
reason 
better, 
we 
have 
always 
been 
able 
to 
do 
so. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
the 
deductive 
knowledge 
with 
which 
we 
started 
is 
what 
we 
call 
a 
priori 
knowledge. 
Not 
all 
deductive 
knowledge 
is 
a 
priori, 
obviously, 
but 
all 
such 
knowledge 
presupposes 
a 
priori 
deductive 
knowledge 


MAX: 
But 
if 
these 
principles 
are 
within 
us---if 
knowledge 
of 
them 
is 
constitutive 
of 
our 
ability 
to 
reason---then 
why 
do 
people 
have 
to 
take 
logic 
classes 
and 
read 
logic 
books 
to 
learn 
about 
these 
principles? 
Why 
is 
knowledge 
of 
them---or, 
at 
least, 
conscious 
knowledge 
of 
them 
such 
a 
rare 
thing? 


Dr. 
K: 
The 
principles 
of 
which 
we 
have 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
are 
not 
the 
objects 
of 
thought; 
they 
are 
not 
what 
we 
think 
about; 
they 
are 
our 
ability 
to 
think. 


MAX: 
I 
think 
I 
understand. 
If 
all 
of 
the 
logic-knowledge 
that 
a 
given 
person 
acquired 
in 
college 
were 
erased 
from 
his 
mind 
one 
day, 
but 
that 
person 
were 
otherwise 
unaffected, 
he 
would 
still 
have 
a 
mind. 
He 
would 
still 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
reason. 
In 
fact, 
his 
ability 
to 
reason, 
except 
in 
very 
specific 
and 
artificial 
domains, 
would 
be 
unaffected. 


But 
if 
a 
given 
person’s 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
were 
erased 
from 
his 
mind, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
mind 
left. 
There 
would 
be 
no 
intellect, 
certainly, 
and 
I 
don’t 
know 
that 
there 
would 
be 
much 
else. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
Ordinary 
knowledge---in 
other 
words, 
knowledge 
of 
the 
non-a 
priori 
variety—is 
a 
relation 
between 
the 
subject, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
the 
truth 
known, 
on 
the 
other. 
A 
priori 
knowledge 
is 
not 
such 
a 
relation; 
for 
without 
such 
knowledge, 
the 
subject 
isn’t 
there 
to 
begin 
with. 



MAX: 
So 
a 
priori 
knowledge 
is 
impersonal? 


Dr. 
K: 
Chomsky 
uses 
the 
term 
subpersonal. 
But, 
yes, 
it 
would 
appear 
so. 


MAX: 
So 
there 
is 
a 
knower 
but 
no 
known. 


Dr. 
K: 
That 
would 
seem 
to 
follow. 


MAX: 
And 
you 
don’t 
find 
that 
perplexing? 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
do 
find 
it 
perplexing. 


MAX: 
But 
you’re 
convinced 
you’ll 
sort 
it 
out. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
am. 
I 
think 
that’s 
enough 
for 
one 
session, 
Max.

Honesty 
and 
Integrity 


MAX: 
Professor, 
you 
hold 
that 
morality 
and 
self-interest 
coincide, 
is 
that 
right? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes, 
give 
or 
take 
a 
few 
nuances. 


MAX: 
But 
that’s 
obviously 
false. 
If 
I 
come 
across 
a 
brief 
case 
full 
of 
money 
lying 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
street 
and 
I’m 
desperately 
short 
on 
cash, 
I 
have 
an 
ethical 
duty 
to 
turn 
that 
briefcase 
into 
the 
police, 
but 
it 
would 
obviously 
be 
in 
my 
self-interest 
to 
keep 
the 
money. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree. 
And 
if 
I 
were 
in 
that 
situation, 
I 
would 
keep 
the 
money. 
In 
fact, 
I’d 
keep 
it 
even 
if 
I 
weren’t 
short 
on 
cash. 


MAX: 
How 
do 
you 
reconcile 
that 
with 
your 
position? 


Dr. 
K: 
My 
position 
is 
that 
a 
life 
of 
integrity 
is 
a 
good 
life 
and 
that 
a 
life 
without 
it 
is 
not. 
Obviously 
specific 
situations 
will 
arise 
in 
which, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
one’s 
own 
welfare, 
must 
violate 
some 
canon 
of 
ethics. 
But 
a 
life 
that 
was 
based 
on 
fraud 
would 
not 
be 
a 
good 
life, 
and 
a 
life 
that 
is 
not 
based 
on 
a 
fraud 
is 
necessarily 
consistent 
with 
some 
ethical 
code. 


MAX: 
Some 
ethical 
code? 
How 
many 
are 
there? 


Dr. 
K: 
Many. 



MAX: 
So 
you 
are 
a 
moral 
relativist? 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
am 
not. 
MAX: 
Explain. 
Dr. 
K: 
Ethics 
is 
about 
integrity. 
What 
a 
shark 
must 
do 
to 
retain 
its 
integrity 


is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
what 
a 
lamb 
must 
do 
to 
retain 
its 
integrity. 


MAX: 
I 
believe 
Mao 
made 
a 
similar 
point. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes, 
he 
did. 
Anyway, 
what 
a 
given 
creature 
must 
do 
to 
retain, 
or 
to 


augment, 
its 
integrity 
is 
fixed 
by 
its 
biological 
and 
psychological 
endowment. 


MAX: 
By 
its 
psycho-biological 
endowment. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
If 
a 
given 
creature 
has 
a 
given 
psycho-biological 
architecture, 


that 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
objective 
fact. 


MAX: 
I 
think 
I 
see 
where 
you’re 
going. 
Biology 
varies 
from 
creature 
to 
creature, 
and, 
within 
limits, 
from 
person 
to 
person; 
and 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 


psychology, 
since 
a 
person’s 
psychology 
is 
really 
an 
aspect 
of 
his 
biology. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
the 
idea. 
Continue. 


MAX: 
And 
what 
it 
is 
incumbent 
on 
a 
creature 
to 
do 
in 
order 
to 
survive 
or 


a 
fortiori 
to 
flourish 
is 
therefore 
fixed 
by 
its 
biology. 
Am 
I 
on 
track, 
Sir? 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
are. 
Continue. 


MAX: 
Therefore, 
what 
a 
creature 
must 
do 
in 
order 
to 
live 
coherently 
is 


fixed 
by 
its 
psycho-biological 
architecture. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 
Keep 
going. 


MAX: 
So 
psychology 
and 
biology 
vary 
from 
to 
species 
to 
species, 
and 
to 
a 


lesser 
from 
individual 
to 
individual, 
and 
in 
that 
sense 
they 
are 
‘subjective.’ 



But 
it 
is 
not 
a 
matter 
of 
opinion, 
but 
of 
objective, 
scientific 
fact, 
how 
a 
creature’s 
mind 
and 
body 
are 
configured. 
And 
in 
that 
sense 
biology 
and 
psychology 
are 
objective. 
Am 
I 
still 
on 
track? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
Close 
the 
argument. 


MAX: 
The 
imperatives 
of 
morality 
are 
conditional 
truths 
of 
the 
form: 
if 
a 
creature 
has 
constitution 
X, 
then 
it 
must 
do 
Y 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
and 
consolidate 
its 
psycho-biological 
architecture. 
Therefore, 
even 
though 
the 
imperatives 
of 
morality 
are 
variable, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
two 
creature 
don’t 
necessarily 
have 
the 
same 
obligations, 
that 
is 
only 
because 
biology 
is 
variable, 
and 
moral 
facts 
must 
therefore 
be 
as 
variable 
as 
biological 
facts 
if 
they 
are 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
them. 


Dr. 
K: 
Well 
stated. 


MAX: 
Sir, 
I 
grant 
that 
what 
a 
creature 
must 
do 
to 
be 
healthy 
and 
flourish 
is 
fixed 
by 
objective 
facts 
about 
its 
psycho-biological 
structure. 
But 
it 
doesn’t 
follow 
that 
morality 
and 
self-interest 
coincide. 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes 
it 
does. 


MAX: 
No 
it 
doesn’t, 
sir, 
unless 
it 
is 
granted 
that 
one’s 
only 
moral 
obligation 
is 
to 
be 
healthy 
and 
flourish. 


Dr. 
K: 
Don’t 
you 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
be 
healthy 
and 
flourish? 


MAX: 
That 
is 
obviously 
one 
of 
my 
moral 
obligations, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
the 
only 
one. 


Dr. 
K: 
What 
other 
ones 
do 
you 
have? 


MAX: 
I 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
be 
nice 
to 
other 
people. 


Dr. 
K: 
Even 
if 
it 
means 
undermining 
your 
own 
welfare? 
Your 
own 
health? 


MAX: 
That’s 
a 
good 
point. 
But 
still. 



Dr. 
K: 
Still 
what? 


MAX: 
I 
have 
an 
obligation 
to 
keep 
promises, 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
people, 
at 
least 
within 
reason, 
to 
take 
responsibility 
for 
my 
own 
actions, 
and 
not 
to 
damage 
the 
environment 
or 
to 
undermine 
institutions 
on 
which 
others 
depend. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree. 
You 
do 
have 
such 
obligations. 


MAX: 
But 
that 
means 
that 
I 
have 
moral 
obligations 
other 
than 
to 
be 
healthy 
and 
flourish.. 


Dr. 
K: 
If 
you 
never 
took 
responsibility 
for 
your 
own 
actions, 
would 
your 
psyche 
retain 
its 
integrity? 


MAX: 
Please 
clarify 
the 
question. 


Dr. 
K: 
If 
you 
never 
took 
responsibility 
for 
your 
actions, 
would 
you 
retain 
your 
psychological 
integrity? 
I 
am 
not 
referring 
to 
moral 
integrity. 
I 
am 
talking 
about 
your 
psychological 
architecture. 


MAX: 
If 
I 
lied 
to 
myself 
about 
what 
I 
had 
done, 
if 
I 
always 
rationalized 
away 
my 
own 
failures, 
then, 
no, 
I 
would 
not 
retain 
my 
psychological 
integrity. 
I 
would 
live 
in 
a 
bubble 
of 
psychosis. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
If 
you 
always 
let 
yourself 
off 
the 
hook, 
if 
you 
didn’t 
admit 
that 
it 
was 
your 
responsibility 
to 
right-size 
yourself 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
mechanisms 
that 
govern 
the 
world, 
then 
you’d 
always 
be 
on 
the 
wrong 
side 
of 
those 
mechanisms. 
And 
you’d 
be 
impotent, 
unable 
to 
change 
the 
external 
world 
or, 
therefore, 
yourself. 


MAX: 
Granted, 
Professor. 
If 
you 
always 
rationalized---if 
you 
never 
copped 
to 
your 
own 
failures 
and 
forced 
yourself 
to 
improve, 
so 
that 
you 
would 
not 
repeat 
those 
failures---you 
would 
disintegrate 
into 
a 
condition 
of 
utter 
impotence, 
and 
possibly 
of 
psychotic 
isolation 
from 
reality. 



Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
That 
shows 
that 
being 
honest 
with 
oneself 
is 
necessary 
for 
a 
good 
life. 
It 
doesn’t 
show 
that 
being 
honest 
with 
others 
is 
necessary 
for 
it. 


Dr. 
K: 
Are 
you 
sure 
about 
that? 


MAX: 
Yes, 
unless 
it 
could 
be 
proved 
that 
being 
honest 
with 
oneself 
involved 
being 
honest 
with 
others---unless 
that 
could 
be 
established, 
then, 
yes, 
I 
am 
sure 
that 
having 
a 
good 
life 
doesn’t 
involve 
being 
honest 
with 
others. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
you 
believe 
that 
one 
can 
be 
dishonest 
with 
others 
and 
honest 
with 
oneself? 


MAX: 
I 
believe 
that 
one 
can 
lie 
to 
others 
without 
lying 
to 
oneself. 
Yes. 
That 
is 
what 
I 
believe. 


Dr. 
K: 
It 
sounds 
as 
though 
you 
don’t 
believe 
it. 


MAX: 
I 
have 
my 
doubts, 
I 
will 
admit. 


Dr. 
K: 
Explain. 


MAX: 
The 
people 
I’ve 
known 
who 
were 
pathological 
liars 
were 
never 
honest 
with 
oneselves. 
No 
matter 
how 
egregiously 
they 
failed----and 
fail 
they 
did, 
all 
of 
them, 
all 
them 
time, 
in 
the 
worst 
possible---no 
matter 
how 
badly 
they 
failed, 
they 
could 
rationalize 
their 
failure 
to 
themselves. 
They 
could, 
and 
they 
did. 


Dr. 
K: 
So 
people 
who 
lie 
to 
others 
lie 
to 
themselves. 


MAX: 
Right. 
And 
vice 
versa. 


Dr. 
K: 
Explain. 


MAX: 
If 
someone 
always 
rationalizes, 
if 
he 
always 
lies 
to 
himself, 
as 
it 
suits 
him, 
as 
these 
pathological 
liars 
did, 
then 
he 
has 
no 
reason 
not 
to 
lie 
to 



others. 
After 
all, 
if 
such 
a 
person 
gets 
stuck 
in 
a 
lie, 
they 
can 
just 
do 
more 
rationalizing. 
For 
rationalizers, 
it’s 
all 
about 
what 
is 
convenient 
at 
that 
exact 
time, 
in 
that 
exact 
context. 
Everything 
else 
is 
up 
for 
grabs. 
For 
such 
people, 
where 
there 
isn’t 
an 
immediate, 
tangible 
reason 
to 
behave 
in 
a 
certain 
way, 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
of 
any 
kind 
to 
behave 
in 
that 
way. 


Dr. 
K: 
So 
you 
agree 
with 
me, 
then. 


MAX: 
Please 
clarify. 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
hold 
that 
honesty 
with 
oneself 
is 
necessary 
for 
a 
good 
life. 


MAX: 
I 
do. 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
hold 
that 
honesty 
with 
others 
is 
necessary 
for 
honesty 
with 
oneself. 


MAX: 
I 
do. 


Dr. 
K: 
Therefore, 
you 
hold 
that 
honesty 
with 
others 
is 
necessary 
for 
a 
good 
life. 


MAX: 
Very 
clever, 
Professor. 
But 
here’s 
where 
I 
don’t 
agree 
with 
you. 
I 
grant 
that, 
given 
how 
it 
is 
that 
human 
beings 
are 
configured, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
lie 
habitually 
without 
to 
some 
extent 
believing 
one’s 
own 
lies. 
And 
I 
grant 
that 
people 
who 
believe 
their 
own 
lies 
implode 
psychologically. 
So, 
yes, 
I 
do 
grant 
that, 
human 
psychology 
being 
what 
it 
is, 
a 
modicum 
of 
honesty 
with 
others 
is 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
mental 
health 
and, 
therefore, 
for 
a 
good 
life. 
Yes, 
I 
grant 
all 
of 
that. 
But… 


Dr. 
K: 
But 
what? 


MAX: 
But 
that 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
contingent 
fact 
about 
human 
beings. 
There 
could 
exist 
creatures 
that 
did 
not 
have 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
others 
in 
order 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
themselves. 
So, 
yes, 
I 
grant 
that, 
where 
human 
beings 
are 
concerned, 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
honesty 
with 
others 
is 
necessary 
for 
mental 
health 
and 
personal 
welfare, 
I 
don’t 
see 
why 
this 
hold 
universally. 
I 
see 
it 
as 



holding 
only 
for 
creatures 
of 
a 
certain 
psychological 
configuration. 
Dr. 
K: 
But 
didn’t 
we 
agree 
that 
what 
it 
is 
incumbent 
on 
a 
given 
creature 
to 


do 
is 
determined 
by 
its 
psychological 
configuration? 


MAX: 
We 
did. 


Dr. 
K: 
Didn’t 
we 
agree 
that 
what 
it 
is 
ethically 
incumbent 
on 
a 
shark 
to 
do 


is 
different 
from 
what 
it 
is 
ethically 
incumbent 
on 
a 
lamb 
to 
do. 


MAX: 
Yes, 
we 
did. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
am 
not 
seeing 
where 
we 
disagree. 


MAX: 
I’ll 
tell 
you 
where, 
sir. 
Let’s 
suppose 
that 
there 
there 
exist 
creatures 


of 
this 
kind, 
creatures 
that 
are 
configured 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
they 
can 
be 
dishonest 
with 
us 
while 
be 
honest 
with 
themselves. 


Dr. 
K: 
High 
IQ 
sharks, 
in 
other 
words. 
Predators. 


MAX: 
Exactly. 
So 
these 
walking, 
talking 
sharks 
could 
be 
dishonest 
with 
us, 
and 
it 
wouldn’t 
hurt 
them 
in 
the 
least. 


Dr. 
K: 
Agreed. 


MAX: 
But 
they 
would 
have 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
us. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
don’t 
know 
that 
they 
would. 
If 
cats 
could 
talk 
with 
mice, 
would 
cats 
have 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
mice? 


MAX: 
Good 
point. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
human 
beings 
do 
lie 
to 
animals. 
Not 
verbally, 
of 
course. 
But 
they 
lay 
traps 
for 
them 
and 
mislead 
them 
in 
all 
sorts 
of 
ways. 


MAX: 
That’s 
true. 



Dr. 
K: 
Do 
you 
think 
that 
a 
human 
being 
who 
lives 
by 
hunting 
animals 
has 
an 
obligation 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
those 
animals 
about 
where 
he 
has 
laid 
his 
traps? 


MAX: 
No, 
I 
suppose 
not. 


Dr. 
K: 
Let 
me 
ask 
you 
another 
question, 
Max. 
When 
humans 
deceive 
animals 
in 
this 
way, 
are 
they 
also 
deceiving 
themselves? 
Is 
a 
person 
who 
uses 
trickery 
to 
catch 
his 
prey 
in 
the 
same 
category 
as 
a 
person 
who 
lies 
to 
another 
person? 


MAX: 
No, 
they 
are 
in 
very 
different 
categories, 
in 
many 
ways. 
A 
human 
who 
lies 
to 
others 
lacks 
integrity, 
but 
a 
human 
who 
uses 
trickery 
to 
catch 
his 
dinner 
might 
be 
integrity 
personifed. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
Let’s 
think 
about 
these 
hypothetical 
aliens 
of 
yours, 
these 
high 
IQ 
sharks, 
who 
can 
walk 
and 
talk. 
Let’s 
suppose 
that 
they 
predate 
on 
us, 
just 
as 
cheetahs 
predate 
on 
gazelles, 
and 
that, 
to 
that 
end, 
they 
lie 
to 
us. 


MAX: 
I’m 
with 
you. 


Dr. 
K: 
Would 
these 
shark-beings 
have 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
be 
honest 
with 
us? 


MAX: 
That’s 
not 
clear, 
but, 
I 
grant, 
any 
such 
obligation 
they 
might 
have 
would 
be 
far 
more 
tenuous 
than 
a 
person’s 
obligation 
to 
be 
moral 
with 
other 
people. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
let 
me 
ask 
you 
another 
question: 
do 
you 
have 
moral 
obligations 
to 
insects? 


MAX: 
Not 
really. 
I 
mean, 
maybe, 
but, 
if 
so, 
those 
obligations 
are 
weak 
ones. 


Dr. 
K: 
What 
about 
rodents? 


MAX: 
I 
would 
say 
that 
my 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
rodents 
are 
stronger 



than 
my 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
insects, 
but 
they 
are 
definitely 
weaker 
than 
my 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
people. 


Dr. 
K: 
What 
about 
oranutans, 
dolphins, 
and 
whales? 
Do 
you 
have 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
them? 


MAX: 
My 
obligations 
towards 
them 
are 
weaker 
than 
my 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
other 
people 
but 
stronger 
than 
my 
obligations 
towards 
rodents, 
and 
far 
stronger 
than 
my 
obligations 
towards 
insects. 


Dr. 
K: 
What 
about 
people 
in 
other 
countries? 
In 
countries 
that 
you 
will 
never 
visit? 


MAX: 
I 
have 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
the 
people 
in 
those 
countries. 


Dr. 
K: 
Are 
they 
as 
strong 
as 
the 
moral 
obligations 
that 
you 
have 
towards 
your 
fellow 
citizens? 


MAX: 
I 
suppose 
not. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
what 
about 
your 
obligations 
towards 
immediate 
family 
members? 
Are 
those 
obligations 
stronger 
than 
those 
towards 
somebody 
in 
some 
remote 
part 
of 
the 
country, 
with 
whom 
you 
have 
no 
connection, 
apart 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
is 
a 
fellow 
citizen? 


MAX: 
Yes, 
of 
course. 
I 
mean, 
I 
do 
have 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
all 
fellow 
citizens 
and 
towards 
all 
human 
beings. 
But 
obviously 
my 
obligations 
towards 
some 
people 
are 
stronger 
than 
my 
obligations 
towards 
others. 
And 
my 
obligations 
towards 
immediately 
family 
and 
close 
friends 
are 
the 
strongest 
moral 
obligations 
that 
I 
have, 
with 
the 
possible 
exception 
my 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
myself. 


Dr. 
K: 
Do 
you 
see 
the 
principle 
implicit 
in 
all 
this? 


MAX: 
I 
think 
so. 
The 
more 
some 
other 
creature’s 
being 
is 
confluent 
with 
one’s 
own, 
the 
more 
one 
has 
moral 
obligations 
towards 
that 
being. 



Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
Professor, 
a 
moment 
ago, 
we 
were 
talking 
about 
walking, 
talking 
sharks---about 
predators 
who 
could 
walk 
and 
talk 
and 
transact 
with 
us, 
but 
whose 
psychological 
configurations 
permitted 
them 
to 
lie 
to 
us 
without 
lie 
to 
themselves. 
It 
occurs 
to 
me 
that 
such 
creatures 
exist. 


Dr. 
K: 
Explain. 


MAX: 
Some 
human 
beings 
are 
predators. 
Admittedly, 
many 
human 
predators 
are 
damaged 
and 
deranged 
misfits. 
Predators 
of 
that 
sort 
tend 
to 
live 
pretty 
miserable 
lives, 
so 
they 
aren’t 
a 
counter-example 
to 
your 
thesis 
that 
morality 
and 
self-interest 
coalesce. 
But 
I 
don’t 
know 
that 
all 
human 
predators 
fall 
into 
this 
category. 


Dr. 
K: 
Elaborate. 


MAX: 
I 
have 
read 
a 
lot 
of 
books 
about 
the 
Mafia, 
the 
Italian-American 
Mafia. 
A 
lot 
of 
those 
books 
were 
written 
by 
mafiosos 
themselves, 
the 
most 
famous 
example 
being 
Wiseguy, 
which 
the 
movie 
Goodfellas 
is 
based 
on. 
Anyway, 
there 
have 
been 
a 
lot 
of 
these 
books, 
and 
I’ve 
read 
most 
of 
them. 
And 
the 
story 
is 
always 
the 
same. 
The 
mafioso 
writing 
the 
book 
throws 
in 
a 
sentence 
or 
two 
about 
how 
terrible 
life 
in 
the 
mafia 
was, 
but 
the 
feeling 
I 
get 
is 
that 
they 
enjoyed 
it. 
And 
whenever 
one 
of 
these 
mafiosos 
recounts 
his 
exploits, 
he 
does 
so 
with 
glee. 
Not 
only 
is 
there 
not 
the 
slightest 
tinge 
or 
regret: 
they 
always 
talks 
about 
their 
capers---their, 
oftentimes, 
phenomenally 
vicious 
crimes---with 
glee, 
and 
pride. 


Dr. 
K: 
This 
is 
interesting. 
Continue. 


MAX: 
And 
the 
thing 
is, 
their 
lives 
as 
mafiosos 
were 
incredibly 
brutal. 
What 
they 
had 
to 
deal 
with, 
from 
the 
law, 
and 
also 
from 
other 
mafiosos, 
was 
unspeakable. 
But 
unless 
they 
were 
either 
facing 
a 
very 
long 
jail 
sentence---20 
years 
or 
more---or 
they 
knew, 
with 
certainty, 
that 
some 
other 
mafioso 
was 
going 
to 
succeed 
in 
killing 
them, 
they 
didn’t 
even 
consisder 
leaving 
the 
mafia. 
And, 
most 
importantly, 
these 
ex-mafiosos 
always 
seemed 
rather 
chipper. 



Dr. 
K: 
They 
are 
chipper. 
I 
knew 
a 
couple. 
Unless 
they 
were 
on 
trial, 
they 
were 
upbeat 
and 
jolly. 


MAX: 
That 
confirms 
what 
I’m 
about 
to 
say. 
Their 
lives 
were 
about 
deception. 
For 
them, 
deception 
was 
not 
just 
a 
means 
to 
end. 
It 
seemed 
to 
be 
an 
end 
unto 
itself. 
But---when 
they 
weren’t 
in 
jail 
or 
otherwise 
in 
some 
objectively 
bad 
situation---they 
seemed 
to 
be 
authentically 
happy. 
And 
I 
don’t 
see 
how 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
your 
thesis. 


Dr. 
K: 
Actually, 
it 
is 
consistent 
with 
it. 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
omertá 
is? 


MAX: 
Yes, 
it’s 
the 
oath 
of 
loyaly 
a 
mobster 
takes 
when 
he 
is 
being 
formally 
inducted 
into 
the 
mafia. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
what 
is 
that 
oath 
exactly? 


MAX: 
You 
sware 
to 
be 
loyal 
to 
other 
members 
of 
your 
crime 
family. 
You 
sware 
not 
to 
talk 
to 
law 
enforcement. 
You 
sware 
not 
to 
strike 
them. 
You 
sware 
not 
to 
sleep 
with 
their 
wives. 
You 
sware 
to 
give 
a 
certain 
percentage 
of 
your 
earnings 
to 
your 
capo. 
And 
so 
on. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
The 
upshot 
is 
that 
one 
mafioso 
has 
to 
behave 
with 
unremitting 
integrity 
towards 
other 
mafiosos, 
except 
when 
it’s 
necessary 
to 
sacrifice 
a 
given 
mafioso 
to 
save 
the 
family. 


MAX: 
I 
think 
I 
see 
where 
you 
are 
going 
with 
all 
this, 
but 
if 
you 
could 
be 
a 
little 
more 
explicit, 
that 
would 
help. 


Dr. 
K: 
Mafiosos 
are 
indeed 
untterly 
evil 
towards 
non-mafiosos; 
and 
they 
can 
be 
evil 
towards 
other 
mafiosos 
without 
themselves 
becoming 
rationalizing 
basketcases, 
like 
the 
pathological 
liars 
you 
described 
earlier. 
But 
that 
is 
only 
because 
they 
constitute 
a 
relatively 
self-contained 
community. 
An 
ordinary 
person 
does 
not 
have 
a 
tight 
knit 
community 
of 
confederates 
on 
whom 
he 
can 
rely, 
at 
least 
not 
in 
anything 
like 
the 
way 
a 
mafioso 
can 
rely 
on 
his 
fellow 
mafiosos. 
An 
ordinary 
person’s 
dependencies 
are 
dispersed 
over 
a 
vast 
cultural, 
social, 
legal, 
and 
political 
landscapes. 
And 
an 
ordinary 
person’s 



moral 
obligations 
are 
also 
dispersed 
over 
the 
same 
landscapes. 


MAX: 
I 
think 
I 
understand. 
Moral 
obligations 
track 
prudential 
ties. 
Morality 
tracks 
practicality. 


Dr. 
K: 
Well 
stated. 
The 
mafioso 
has 
deliberately 
structured 
his 
life 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
concentrate 
all 
of 
his 
prudential 
ties 
into 
tightly 
a 
circumscribed 
and 
well 
defined 
community. 


MAX: 
I 
see. 
That’s 
why 
a 
mafioso 
can 
lie 
to 
non-mafiosos 
without 
lying 
to 
himself. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
But 
if 
a 
mafioso’s 
relationship 
to 
fellow 
mafiosos 
is 
fundamentally 
dishonest---if 
his 
relationship 
to 
them 
parallels 
that 
of 
a 
pathological 
liar 
to 
society, 
then, 
setting 
aside 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
a 
mafioso 
probably 
wouldn’t 
live 
long, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
his 
life 
would 
be 
incoherent 
in 
much 
the 
same 
as 
that 
of 
one 
of 
these 
pathological 
lair 
acquaintances 
of 
yours. 


MAX: 
That 
mafioso 
would 
be 
a 
‘weasel’ 
or 
a 
‘rat’, 
or 
some 
such. 


Dr. 
K: 
That 
sounds 
right. 


MAX: 
And 
his 
lies 
to 
his 
fellow 
mafia 
members 
would 
deplete 
him 
in 
much 
the 
way 
an 
ordinary 
person’s 
lies 
to 
other 
human 
beings 
deplete 
him. 


Dr. 
K: 
Well 
stated. 


MAX: 
So 
even 
though 
there 
is 
a 
superficial, 
technical 
sense 
in 
which 
any 
given 
mafioso 
lies 
to 
other 
mafiosos, 
there 
is 
a 
deeper 
and 
more 
significant 
sense 
in 
which 
a 
certain 
honesty 
and 
truthfulness 
must 
form 
the 
core 
of 
a 
given 
mafioso’s 
relations 
to 
that 
other 
mafiosi 
if 
that 
mafioso 
is 
to 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
‘Man 
of 
Honor’; 
if, 
in 
other 
words, 
he 
is 
to 
continue 
to 
have 
that 
very 
particular---that 
very 
narrowly 
defined 
but 
unmistakeably 
real---decency 
that 
characterizes 
the 
mafioso 
who, 
by 
mafia 
standards, 
is 
a 
man 
of 
stature 
and 
gravitas. 



Dr. 
K: 
Well 
put. 


MAX: 
Something 
occurred 
to 
me, 
Dr. 
K. 


Dr. 
K: 
What’s 
that? 


MAX: 
Suppose 
some 
explorers 
came 
across 
an 
isolated 
tribe 
of 
people 
in 
some 
jungle. 
If 
a 
given 
one 
of 
those 
tribesman 
was 
hostile 
to 
those 
explorers 
while 
being 
honest 
and 
decent 
with 
his 
fellow 
tribesman, 
we 
would 
not 
regard 
him 
as 
lacking 
integrity. 
But 
if 
a 
given 
tribesman 
were 
more 
decent 
to 
the 
explorers 
than 
to 
his 
fellow 
tribesman---if 
he 
simply 
jettisoned 
all 
of 
his 
ties 
to 
his 
tribesman 
in 
order 
to 
cozy 
up 
to 
the 
explorers—we 
would 
regard 
him 
as 
lacking 
integrity. 
In 
fact, 
we’d 
see 
him 
as 
positively 
psychopathic. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
it 
wouldn’t 
be 
until, 
and 
unless, 
those 
tribesman 
developed 
deeply 
entrenched 
relations 
of 
mutual 
dependency 
with 
the 
explorers 
that 
we 
would 
expect 
them 
to 
treat 
the 
explorers 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
they 
treated 
each 
other. 
And 
until 
that 
point 
we 
wouldn’ 
t 
see 
such 
behavior 
as 
justified. 


MAX: 
Professor, 
I 
think 
you 
have 
made 
a 
case 
that 
some 
kind 
of 
morality 
is 
confluent 
with 
some 
some 
kind 
of 
self-interest. 
But 
I 
still 
think 
it’s 
going 
a 
bit 
far 
to 
say 
that 
morality 
categorically 
coincides 
with 
self-interest. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree 
that, 
given 
only 
what 
has 
been 
said 
thus 
far, 
it 
remains 
open 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
two 
coincide. 


MAX: 
Sir, 
I 
don’t 
think 
I 
can 
handle 
any 
more 
information 
today. 
Do 
you 
think 
we 
take 
a 
break 
and 
resume 
this 
discussion 
later? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
But 
it 
won’t 
just 
be 
one 
conversation; 
it 
will 
be 
many. 
There 
is 
a 
lot 
to 
cover. 


MAX: 
Actually, 
there 
is 
one 
thing 
I’d 
like 
clear 
up 
before 
we 
adjourn. 


Dr. 
K: 
What 
is 
that? 


MAX: 
You 
said 
that 
if 
you 
found 
a 
briefcase 
full 
of 
money, 
you’d 
keep 
it, 



rather 
than 
turn 
it 
into 
the 
police. 
How 
do 
you 
reconcile 
that 
with 
your 
contention 
and 
morality 
and 
self-interest 
coincide? 


Dr. 
K: 
Honesty 
is 
one 
thing, 
compulsive 
truthfulness 
is 
another. 
And 
somewhere 
in 
that 
distinctdion 
is 
the 
answer 
to 
your 
question. 
But 
the 
particulars 
are 
best 
left 
for 
another 
time. 


MAX: 
I 
think 
I 
understand 
the 
distinction. 
There 
is 
a 
kind 
of 
pettry 
truthfulness----a 
punctilliousness 
about 
details 
and 
little 
facts---that 
is 
not 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
true 
honest 
but 
which 
is 
often 
mistaken 
with 
true 
honesty. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct: 


MAX: 
And 
may 
even 
be 
used 
as 
away 
of 
being 
fundementally 
dishonest. 


Dr. 
K: 
Interesting. 
Explain. 


MAX: 
Truthfulness 
about 
little 
things 
is 
often 
used 
to 
deflect 
attention 
away 
from 
big 
things, 
and 
I’ve 
known 
many 
a 
complete 
sociopath 
who 
was 
a 
stickler 
for 
little 
facts 
and 
used 
this 
micro-truthfulness 
to 
misrepresent 
big 
facts. 


Dr. 
K: 
Micro-honesty 
pressed 
into 
the 
service 
of 
macro-dishonesty. 


MAX: 
So 
whereas 
micro-honesty 
is 
truthfulness 
about 
little 
facts, 
macro-
honesty 
is 
truthfulness 
about 
the 
realities 
meant 
by 
those 
facts. 
And 
true 


honesty 
is 
macro-honesty. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
And 
your 
returning 
the 
briefcase 
would 
fall 
into 
the 
category 
of 


micro-dishonesty 
that 
is 
not 
macro-dishonesty, 
is 
that 
the 
idea? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 


MAX: 
But 
surely 
macro-honesty 
involves 
micro-honesty? 



Dr. 
K: 
Yes 
it 
does. 


MAX: 
Ok. 
And 
that 
would 
explain 
why 
being 
micro-honest 
is 
such 
an 
effective 
of 
being 
macro-dishonest. 


Dr. 
K: 
Explain. 


MAX: 
Since 
honesty 
about 
big 
things 
tends 
to 
involve 
honesty 
about 
little 
things, 
and 
since 
the 
sort 
of 
people 
who 
are 
honest 
about 
big 
things 
tend 
also 
to 
be 
truthful 
about 
little 
things, 
there 
is 
a 
presumtion 
to 
the 
effective 
that 
any 
case 
of 
micro-honesty 
is 
a 
case 
of 
macro-honesty. 


Dr. 
K: 
That 
sounds 
right. 


MAX: 
But 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
little 
facts, 
and 
only 
a 
few 
big 
ones. 
So 
somebody 
who 
wants 
to 
misrepresent 
or 
obscure 
big 
facts 
can 
easily 
find 
trivia 
about 
which 
to 
be 
honest, 
while, 
for 
that 
very 
reason, 
being 
given 
credit 
for 
being 
genuintly 
truthful. 


Dr. 
Your 
reasoning 
is 
cogent, 
Max. 


MAX: 
But 
I 
still 
don’t 
quite 
see 
how 
this 
relates 
to 
the 
briefcase 
situation. 


Dr. 
K: 
As 
I 
said, 
that’s 
a 
topic 
for 
another 
time. 


MAX: 
Sir, 
are 
you 
just 
saying 
that, 
or 
will 
you 
and 
I 
have 
an 
exchange 
in 
which 
it 
is 
made 
clear 
exactly 
honesty 
is 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
We 
will, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
published 
as 
an 
audio 
book, 
just 
like 
this 
exchange. 


MAX: 
One 
last 
question, 
Dr. 
K. 
You 
used 
to 
write 
treatises. 
Now 
you 
write 
audio-dialogues. 
Why 
is 
that? 


Dr. 
K: 
When 
were 
primitive, 
it 
was 
all 
about 
spoken 
communication. 
We 
advanced 
a 
little, 
and 
it 
became 
about 
written 
communication. 
We 
advanced 
some 
more, 
and 
now 
it’s 
about 
spoken 
communication 
again. 
And 
it’s 
better 



this 
way, 
since 
a 
lot 
of 
information 
that 
is 
written 
in 
a 
book 
is 
never 
uploaded, 
whereas 
most 
information 
that 
is 
spoken 
is 
uploaded. 


MAX: 
Good 
answer, 
Sir. 
See 
you 
next 
time. 


Anger 


MAX: 
Dr. 
K, 
I 
have 
been 
reading 
the 
works 
of 
the 
Buddha. 
One 
thing 
he 
repeatedly 
says 
is 
that 
you 
should 
let 
go 
of 
anger. 
But 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
let 
go 
of 
my 
anger. 


Dr. 
K: 
Why 
not? 
MAX: 
Because 
it 
would 
diminish 
me. 
Dr. 
K: 
How 
do 
you 
mean? 
MAX: 
I 
don’t 
want 
to 
submit. 
I 
want 
to 
conquer. 
It’s 
easy 
to 
be 
a 
loser 
who 


lets 
the 
world 
walk 
all 
over 
you, 
and 
then 
rationalize 
it 
by 
saying 
that 
you 
are 
a 
moral 
person 
who 
wants 
other 
people 
to 
be 
given 
their 
due. 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree. 
It’s 
easy 
to 
be 
a 
loser. 
It’s 
easy 
and 
its 
contemptible. 
MAX: 
And 
it’s 
hard 
to 
be 
a 
winner. 
It’s 
hard, 
and 
it’s 
admirable. 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree. 
MAX: 
So 
now 
you 
see 
why 
I 
don’t 
find 
Buddha’s 
teachings 
to 
be 
feasible. 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
understand 
why 
that 
is 
your 
position, 
but 
your 
position 
is 
misconceived. 



MAX: 
Explain. 


Dr. 
K: 
The 
essence 
of 
what 
Buddha 
is 
saying, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
passages 
that 
you 
have 
in 
mind, 
is 
that, 
if 
we 
dwell, 
if 
we 
linger, 
if 
live 
in 
fantasy, 
rather 
than 
reality, 
we 
will 
get 
nowhere. 


MAX: 
Continue. 
This 
is 
helpful. 


Dr. 
K: 
It 
would 
obviously 
be 
ideal 
if 
you 
could 
make 
those 
who 
had 
wronged 
you 
pay 
for 
their 
crimes. 


MAX: 
Yes 
it 
would 
be. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
perhaps 
that 
shall 
happen. 
But 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
you 
are 
emoting, 
you 
are 
not 
moving 
forward. 
So 
far 
as 
you 
emote, 
you 
live 
in 
fantasy, 
not 
in 
reality. 
And 
so 
far 
as 
you 
live 
in 
fantasy, 
you 
wither. 


MAX: 
I 
see. 
If 
you 
spend 
all 
your 
time 
fantasizing 
about 
what 
you 
want, 
what 
you’ll 
get 
is 
the 
exact 
opposite. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


MAX: 
And 
a 
necessary 
precondition 
for 
moving 
forward 
is 
that 
you 
drop 
all 
of 
your 
childish 
fantasies 
of 
revenge. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
The 
angry 
man 
lives 
in 
fantasy, 
not 
in 
reality. 
And 
his 
achievements 
in 
reality 
are 
as 
small 
as 
his 
achievements 
in 
his 
imagination 
are 
great. 


MAX: 
So 
it 
isn’t 
that 
there 
is 
anything 
wrong 
with 
the 
content 
of 
your 
anger-driven 
fantasies. 
It’s 
that, 
as 
long 
as 
you 
fantasize, 
you 
aren’t 
living 
in 
the 
real 
world. 


Dr. 
K: 
So 
you 
aren’t 
really 
living 
at 
all. 


MAX: 
So 
if 
you 
spend 
your 
time 
stewing 
and 
seething 
and 
day-dreaming 
about 
how 
you’ll 
get 
revenge, 
you’ll 
do 
nothing 
but 
waste 
your 
own 
time. 



Dr. 
K: 
And 
your 
position 
relative 
to 
the 
person 
on 
whom 
you 
wish 
to 
exact 
revenge 
will 
decline. 


MAX: 
Because 
you 
will 
be 
moving 
backwards. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
also 
because 
you 
have 
already 
given 
up. 


MAX: 
Explain. 


Dr. 
K: 
People 
who 
believe 
in 
themselves 
improve 
themsleves. 
People 
who 
don’t, 
don’t. 
And 
when 
people 
choose 
fantasy 
over 
reality, 
it 
is 
because 
they 
have 
given 
up. 


MAX: 
They 
don’t 
believe 
they 
can 
change 
reality. 
That 
is 
the 
conceit 
that 
lies 
at 
the 
center 
of 
all 
of 
their 
day-dreaming. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 


MAX: 
Contrariwise, 
if 
they 
drop 
the 
fantasizing, 
and 
therefore 
drop 
the 
anger 
that 
fuels 
it, 
they 
have 
no 
choice 
but 
accept 
their 
circumstances. 


Dr. 
K: 
Their 
actual 
circumstances. 


MAX: 
And 
therefore 
to 
improve 
those 
circumstances. 


Dr. 
K: 
By 
small 
increments 
at 
first. 


MAX: 
But 
those 
small 
increments 
turn 
into 
big 
ones. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
the 
initial 
tiny 
steps 
on 
the 
road 
to 
self-improvement 
are 
actually 
the 
biggest 
steps. 


MAX: 
In 
the 
same 
way 
that 
the 
difference 
between 
0 
and 
1 
is 
infinite, 
whereas 
the 
difference 
between 
1 
and 
and 
a 
thousand 
is 
finite. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
The 
difference 
between 
0 
and 
1 
is 
the 
difference 
between 



being 
and 
nothingness. 


The 
difference 
between 
1 
and 
a 
thousa 
numbers. 


MAX: 
It 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
two 
opposed 
to 
one 
thing 
that 
doesn’t 
and 
on 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
differences 
of 
the 
appear 
to 
be. 


MAX: 
I 
see. 
When 
one 
is 
mired 
in 
fan 
and 
pauper 
is 
infinite, 
because 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
utter 
impotence—it 
is 
infi 
someone 
who 
is 
steadily 
improving 
his 
c 
quantitative 
difference. 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
are 
a 
quick 
study, 
Max. 
L 


Knowledge 
of 
Past, 
P 


MAX: 
Professor, 
can 
we 
have 
knowle 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
If 
I 
know 
that 
X’s 
always 
currently 
exists 
an 
X, 
then 
I 
can 
deduce, 
be 
a 
Y. 


MAX: 
Can 
you 
give 
an 
example? 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
know 
that 
Smith 
is 
extremely 
always 
attacks 
people 
who 
make 
fun 
of 
Jerry 
is 
now 
making 
fun 
of 
Smith 
for

physically
