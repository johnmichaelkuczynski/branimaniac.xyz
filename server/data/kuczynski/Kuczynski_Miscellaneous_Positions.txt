MISCELLANEOUS KUCZYNSKI POSITION STATEMENTS

1. The conscious event (W) that subjects believe to be their decision is not the operative intention causing the action.

2. W is an awareness of an already-made decision, not the decision itself.

3. The readiness potential (RP) is the proximal psychological cause of the action, not W.

4. W is not epiphenomenal tout court, even if epiphenomenal with respect to the particular finger-movement.

5. Consciousness of one's intentions necessarily has downstream effects on subsequent thought and behavior.

6. W may serve a "veto" function rather than an initiating function.

7. Libet's experiment shows we do not have "conscious free will" in the sense that decisions are not constituents of consciousness.

8. Standing intentions cannot possibly be constituents of consciousness because they are enduring structures.

9. The .2 second delay between intention and awareness is likely not mere "tape-delay" but reflects W's monitoring function.

10. Intentions governing real-time actions are more likely to involve consciousness than standing intentions.

11. RLE (Results of Libet's Experiment) are profoundly important and warrant revision of accepted views about agency.

12. Philosophers have attempted to trivialize the Libet experiment rather than engage with it constructively.

13. Little is gained by discussing RLE in terms of "free will" because this concedes validity to assumptions RLE call into question.

14. The question "What does the Libet experiment show?" is more productive than "What does it show about free will?"

15. RLE clearly are significant and almost certainly do generalize.

16. The shape and length of the RP slope is consistent across hundreds of subjects.

17. W either has no effect or a slight negative effect on the trajectory of the RP slope.

18. If W were the operative decision, the graph would inflect upward after W.

19. W's role, judging by the data, is to curb the causally effective process rather than initiate it.

20. Compatibilism holds that freedom is compatible with determinism and may even require it.

21. Indeterminism threatens freedom; determinism seems to be a prerequisite for freedom.

22. Thoughts that lack causal basis in pre-existing psychological structures would be mere intrusions, not exercises of agency.

23. Neuroscience does provide philosophically significant information about intentions, contrary to Roskies.

24. The actions in Libet's experiment are not "degenerate" or reflexive—they are paradigm cases of conscious action.

25. The experiment was designed to maximize the role of consciousness in the relevant action.

26. The claim that Libet confuses correlation with causation is unsupported by evidence.

27. The RP obviously does cause the finger-movement, as shown by the graph's trajectory.

28. Libet's experimental data has been validated by numerous replication studies.

29. The distinction between proximal and distal intentions is valid but does not undermine RLE's significance.

30. Distal intentions are extremely unlikely to be more consciousness-based than proximal intentions.

31. Distal intentions often form without any identifiable conscious "moment" of decision.

32. The position that RP represents mere "urges" rather than intentions is contradicted by the graphical data.

33. The claim that the RP-W event chain is "indivisible" and therefore non-causal is question-begging.

34. Most causality is "processual," mediated by processes, and the RP is a textbook case.

35. The standards of evidence philosophers apply to Libet would, if consistent, require rejecting that smoking causes cancer.

36. What Libet shows is more radical than what Freud showed about the unconscious.

37. Freud regarded consciousness as a weak but real ruler; Libet shows it is a puppet.

38. The "center of consciousness" that people regard as the nucleus of their self is not what it appears to be.

39. RLE show not merely that choices are predetermined but that they are not ours to make.

40. One of consciousness's purposes is to integrate information about the external and internal worlds.

41. Conscious acts of decision-approval are experienced as conscious acts of decision-making.

42. The "illusion of free choice" may be adaptive, preventing consciousness from being overburdened.

43. In approving a given intention, W implicitly green-lights future similar intentions.

44. W serves a directive role with respect to future intentions even if not causing the present one.

45. The appeal to "phenomenological data" that we have free will is straightforwardly question-begging.

46. Free will, if it exists, is a form of causation, and what causes what is always an empirical question.

47. The comparison of free will to the cogito is misconceived because free will claims are not analytic.

48. Follow-up studies using fMRI show RPs begin much earlier than Libet detected—up to 10 seconds before W.

49. Once initiated, the RP is overwhelmingly likely to result in action.

50. Philosophers' defensive responses to Libet represent a missed opportunity for the discipline.

1. Sellars destroyed the "myth of the given" and began a revolution in epistemology.

2. Foundationalism used to be the orthodoxy; anti-foundationalism is now the orthodoxy because of Sellars.

3. George Berkeley destroyed the myth of the given two hundred years before Sellars using a very similar argument.

4. Berkeley's argument is a generalization of Sellars' argument.

5. Berkeley explicitly shows how anti-foundationalism applies to a wide range of contexts, while Sellars discusses only very special contexts.

6. Berkeley provides a non-metaphorical way of interpreting metaphors that dominate contemporary anti-foundationalism.

7. No empirical background knowledge being needed to obtain knowledge of external reality is a false picture.

8. Sellars is not denying that external realities are given to us through sense-perceptions.

9. Sellars attacks the idea that perception makes us aware of external states without cooperation of preexisting empirical knowledge.

10. Background knowledge must be mobilized if a sensory experience is to give us knowledge of an external state of affairs.

11. The given—sensory experience considered apart from background knowledge—is not epistemic.

12. The epistemic significance of a quale is not fixed; it is a variable function of background empirical knowledge.

13. Raw sensations by themselves do not have a fixed message about the outside world.

14. There are two myths of the given: (i) what is given is epistemic; (ii) what is given is representational.

15. What is false is not the belief that there is a given, but that the given is epistemic or representational.

16. Berkeley made essentially the same points as Sellars in An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision (1709).

17. Berkeley's attack on the given is more perspicuous, more radical, and more cogent than Sellars'.

18. Post-Bob can see tie colors in unusual lighting only because background empirical knowledge is operative.

19. Sellars leaves implicit the needed generalizations of his argument.

20. What Sellars says about non-standard conditions applies to perception under standard conditions.

21. Standard conditions are an idealization; no conditions are really standard.

22. If there were perfectly "standard" conditions, they would not be typical.

23. We adjust automatically to changes in perception conditions and are often unaware of massive differences.

24. Background knowledge is operative even when we are not consciously aware of its role.

25. A diamond-shaped object from above gives the same appearance as a square from an oblique angle, yet we instantly know the difference.

26. We disambiguate appearances by taking contextual information into account.

27. A ten-foot stop sign from a hundred feet gives the same appearance as a thousand-foot sign from ten thousand feet.

28. We use benchmarks (trees, houses) and background knowledge to determine object sizes.

29. Any episode of taking in information about the external world involves cooperation of contextual or background information.

30. In the absence of background empirical knowledge, our sensory episodes become indeterminate to the point of meaninglessness.

31. Berkeley correctly argues that one cannot tell just by looking how far away the moon is.

32. What is true of very distant objects regarding distance perception is true, though less obviously, of nearby objects.

33. Visual experience by itself is ambiguous between seeing a massive distant object and a medium-sized nearby object.

34. The appearance given by a receding object is not different from one given by a shrinking object.

35. Contextual information disambiguates what would otherwise be ambiguous visual experience.

36. What ultimately endows visual sensations with distance information is that different visual sensations have different kinesthetic and tactile concomitants.

37. It is not visual sensation by itself that apprises you of distances; it is visual sensation plus sensations of motion, resistance, touch, and duration.

38. Berkeley correctly answers Molyneux's question: a man born blind given sight would not know from vision alone whether he sees round, oval, or square objects.

39. Berkeley gives analogues of his argument for every perceptible property an object might have.

40. When you hear someone talk, you feel as though you directly grasp their meaning, but background knowledge is essential.

41. Visual experiences apprise you of squareness only in the sense that auditory perceptions apprise you of sentence meaning.

42. Seeing shame in a reddening face requires background knowledge of psychosomatic correspondences.

43. No sensory experience by itself tells one anything; it must be contextualized with background knowledge.

44. No sensory experience is foundational; senses tell us about the world only through mediation of past experiences.

45. Empirical knowledge is obtained through coherencies among sensory experiences, not through isolated experiences.

46. Berkeley's argument is superior to Sellars' in being more general—applying to virtually every perceptible property under standard conditions.

47. Sellars doesn't really explain how representational mental entities are forged out of non-representational ones.

48. Berkeley shows in detail how non-representational mental entities from different sensory modalities combine into representational entities.

49. Contemporary anti-foundationalists rely on obscure metaphors (knowledge as "arc" or "web"); Berkeley provides non-metaphorical interpretation.

50. The problem of how perceptions arise from non-representational sensations is more fundamental than the problem of justification.

1. Definite descriptions are not singular terms
2. Grammatical form and logical form sometimes pull apart
3. "The phi has psi" means "something uniquely has phi, and any such thing has psi"
4. Definite descriptions don't refer to anything
5. The meaning of a definite description is given contextually, not denotatively
6. For proper names, there exists an individual x such that knowing the semantic rule requires knowing the name refers to x
7. For definite descriptions, there is no individual x such that knowing its semantics requires knowing it refers to x
8. Sentences containing definite descriptions attribute properties to properties, not to individuals
9. "The inventor of Velcro is intelligent" is about properties, not individuals
10. The property of being instantiated can be attributed to properties
11. "The fountain of youth" is not a referring term because no fountain of youth exists
12. Meaningful expressions need not refer to existing objects
13. The pre-Russellian view that non-referring terms must refer to "ideas" is mistaken
14. Fountains are not ideas
15. Disagreements about whether something exists are not disagreements about whether ideas exist
16. Meinong's notion of "subsistence" as intermediate between existence and non-existence is incoherent
17. Something either exists or it doesn't; there is no intermediate condition
18. Belief reports containing definite descriptions must be reparsed to expose their meaning
19. "The fountain of youth exists" means "the property of being a fountain of youth is uniquely instantiated"
20. Negative existentials don't say of non-existent objects that they don't exist
21. Properties exist even when nothing instantiates them
22. A property's existence means there is a way something would have to be to have that property
23. To say expression R refers to object O means for any property phi, "R has phi" attributes phi to O
24. Expression E refers to O iff for any property phi, "E has phi" attributes phi to O
25. Reference can be identified with the capacity to attribute properties via sentence containment
26. Identity statements involving co-referring definite descriptions should be trivial if descriptions are referring terms
27. "The inventor of bifocals is identical with the first postmaster general" is non-trivial
28. The Theory of Descriptions explains the non-triviality of informative identity statements
29. Positive existentials don't attribute existence to non-existent objects
30. Positive existentials don't make trivial claims that some entity exists
31. Positive existentials claim that a property is instantiated
32. Frege's sense/reference distinction attempts to explain informative identity statements
33. The referent of a definite description is what has the relevant property
34. The sense of a definite description is the property something must have to be its referent
35. Perceptions can have the same object but pick it out through different bodies of information
36. Frege's theory partially collapses into Russell's theory when scrutinized
37. When something is picked out by descriptive information, an existence-claim is being affirmed
38. Frege's view that definite descriptions are sense-bearing referring terms is incoherent
39. Accepting TD while believing definite descriptions are referring terms is contradictory
40. Co-referring terms should be inter-substitutable salva veritate (Leibniz's Law corollary)
41. Definite descriptions in belief contexts fail substitutivity tests
42. TD solves the substitutivity problem by showing descriptions aren't referring terms
43. Frege's distinction between extensional and intensional contexts is a cover-up for deeper problems
44. An extensional context is substitution-tolerant
45. An intensional context is substitution-intolerant
46. There are no genuinely intensional contexts
47. Apparent intensional contexts involve reference to propositions rather than individuals
48. "Smith wants to marry the prettiest woman" is about a proposition Smith wants to be true
49. Reparsing sentences with definite descriptions exposes their logical form
50. Grammatical objects that appear to refer to persons often refer to propositions
51. Frege's semantics embodies a failure to distinguish reference from quantification
52. Definite descriptions are quantifiers, not referring terms
53. Frege's intensional/extensional distinction embodies a failure to see that apparent individual-references are proposition-references
54. The principle of special compositionality (PSC): what an expression refers to depends on what its parts refer to
55. Frege's semantics violates PSC
56. Replacing equals with equals should result in equals
57. Frege's reference-shift thesis is a desperate measure to save his system
58. According to Frege, expressions in intensional contexts refer to their ordinary senses
59. Frege's system implies infinite hierarchies of sense
60. Frege's position is radically counterintuitive
61. Frege's position is logically and methodologically indefensible
62. D-sentences (sentences containing definite descriptions) can be systematically ambiguous
63. Syntactic ambiguity differs from lexical ambiguity
64. Syntactic ambiguity arises from multiple possible operator orderings
65. Scope is a property of operators
66. Operators are expressions that form new sentences from sentences or open-sentences
67. All quantifiers are operators
68. All conjunctions are operators
69. "And," "because," and "or" are two-place operators
70. "Not" is a one-place operator
71. "Everyone loves someone" is syntactically ambiguous between two scope readings
72. Wide-scope and narrow-scope readings of quantifiers yield different truth conditions
73. Grammatical surface structure obscures actual operator scope
74. Syntactic ambiguity wouldn't exist if surface structure perfectly revealed scope
75. Definite descriptions in modal or epistemic contexts create syntactic ambiguity
76. Pre-Russellian philosophers accepted absurdities due to missing the scope distinction
77. "Jerry is looking for the fountain of youth" doesn't require a fountain of youth to exist
78. Looking for something is wanting a certain proposition to be true
79. Nathan Salmon's view that mythical objects exist is unnecessary given Russell's insights
80. Mythical objects don't gush water
81. Quine's rejection of modal concepts stems from failing to grasp scope distinctions
82. Smullyan showed Russell's theory dissolves Quine's anti-modal argument
83. Necessity de dicto differs from necessity de re
84. "Necessarily the inventor of bifocals was the inventor of bifocals" has wide and narrow scope readings
85. The wide-scope reading of modal statements about descriptions is often false
86. The narrow-scope reading can be true when the wide-scope reading is false
87. Given any individual x identical with y, x must be identical with y
88. An open sentence is neither true nor false but can be "true for" certain values
89. An expression satisfies an open sentence if replacing variables with it yields truth
90. Predicates are open sentences
91. Russell extended Frege's work while correcting its incoherencies
92. Russell's Theory of Descriptions was one of his earliest and most important contributions
93. A definite description has the form "the phi" where phi is singular
94. "The people over there" is not a definite description because "people" is plural
95. Two sentences with the same grammatical form can have different logical forms
96. Truth-conditions determine meaning
97. Sentences with different truth-conditions have different semantics
98. An expression's semantics is its meaning
99. A semantic rule assigns meaning to an expression
100. Contextual definition specifies meaning by stating what whole sentences containing the expression mean

1. Events cause other events to occur
2. Objects are not causes; only events are causes
3. The empiricist argument against causation involves a major non-sequitur
4. It is methodologically permissible to posit unobservable causal ties just as we posit unobservable particles
5. The concept of persistence is itself a causal notion
6. Anything that persists is, for that very reason, a causal sequence
7. We observe causal sequences whenever we observe anything
8. The notion of spatial occupancy is a causal concept
9. Malleability and conductivity are causal properties
10. Anything that says anything about the spatiotemporal world has causal content
11. Causally sterile characterizations say nothing about anything
12. Statements like "Carter caused the recession" are elliptical for statements about events involving Carter
13. Having causal properties differs from being a cause
14. Conditions consist of events
15. What we call "conditions" are patterns of constant change
16. What we call "events" are changes in the manner of change
17. Nothing non-spatiotemporal can be a cause
18. Changes happen in time
19. Universals, if they exist, are causally impotent
20. There is always a non-causal component to awareness, even to sense-perception
21. The things we describe as "causes" are really partial causes
22. The complete cause of anything is very hard to identify
23. "The cause" of an event is an INUS-condition for that event
24. An INUS-condition is an insufficient but non-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition
25. Aristotle's belief that things have essences is incoherent
26. Dependence-relations don't hold between objects; they hold between events or statements
27. The concept of a formal cause is incoherent
28. The concept of a material cause is incoherent
29. The concept of efficient causality is coherent
30. Goals per se do nothing; goals are abstract objects
31. A person's having a goal is a garden-variety efficient cause
32. States of affairs, not objects, have effects
33. Propositions, not objects, stand in dependence-relations
34. Dependence-relations hold between propositions, not objects
35. "In virtue of" in causal contexts denotes a form of interpropositional dependence
36. Functionalism amounts to the denial that the mental (qua mental) has any causal powers
37. Functionalism denies the very existence of minds
38. Content-externalism is incoherent
39. Mental content is causally important to the extent content-externalism is wrong
40. Content-externalism embodies a failure to appreciate the concept meant by "in virtue of"
41. x is a program-cause of y if x consists of events that are directly responsible for y
42. High-resolution causal information is not always better than low-resolution causal information
43. Different disciplines deal with different program-causes and distinct nomic connections
44. Biology isn't just bad physics; psychology isn't just bad physiology
45. Predictions are almost always made on the basis of knowledge of program-causes
46. Explanation is reverse-prediction
47. The concept of a program-cause is central to prediction and explanation
48. According to Hume, nothing makes anything happen
49. We do observe forces contrary to what Hume alleges
50. Hume's first analysis of causation is untenable
51. Hume's analysis cannot distinguish epiphenomenal causation from actual causation
52. Hume's analysis entails that spatiotemporally adjacent events must be causally related, which is false
53. There is no way to identify "relevant categories" without already knowing what caused what
54. The concepts of space and time are to be understood in terms of causality
55. Order in time is to be understood in causal terms
56. Order in space is to be understood in causal terms
57. Hume's analysis of causality is viciously circular
58. To occupy a place is to make it harder for other things to enter that place
59. Everything we see persists; anything seen as persisting is seen as a causal process
60. Space and time are not empty containers; spatiotemporal positions are relations between events
61. Hume's denial of causality is based on a pseudo-empirical, crypto-a priori argument
62. The a priori argument against forces is no good
63. The counterfactual analysis of causation (CF) is a failure
64. Even if CF is extensionally correct, it's no analysis of causality
65. Counterfactuals are themselves to be understood in terms of causality
66. CF is guilty of vicious circularity
67. CF assumes there's no causal redundancy in the world, but sometimes there are back-up mechanisms
68. CF isn't extensionally correct
69. Lewis' analysis of counterfactual truth in terms of possible worlds fails
70. Events have causal roots going back to the beginning of time
71. A logical analysis cannot assume empirical facts not in evidence
72. Positing causal slack in worlds makes them unreliable for validating counterfactuals
73. Lewis' appeal to "miracles" in other worlds is ad hoc and produces false counterfactuals
74. Other worlds have nothing to do with counterfactual truth
75. Knowledge of counterfactuals depends on facts in our world, not other worlds
76. Statistical probability differs from explanatory probability
77. The word "probability" is equivocal between statistical and explanatory meanings
78. Probability statements about the future aren't reducible to statistical claims
79. Humeanism cannot explain explanation
80. Explanatory probability concerns minimizing damage to one's belief system
81. P is probable to the extent our beliefs depend on it
82. Counterstatistical events are innocuous; counter-explanatory events are not
83. Rolling double-sixes repeatedly is statistically improbable but explanatorily innocuous
84. Any event, described precisely enough, has vanishingly small statistical probability
85. Goodman's "grue" argument shows that statistical probability alone cannot ground induction
86. Grueness isn't a color; it's a color-related property
87. Hempel's deductive-nomological account of explanation is viciously circular
88. Laws are hyper-explanations; they explain the explanations
89. People already have low-level explanations; on that basis they posit laws
90. Hypotheses concerning laws are distillations of existing low-level explanations
91. Causal anomalies must be minimized in seeking explanations
92. The elimination of causal anomalies consists in the elimination of discontinuities
93. Explanation is discontinuity-elimination
94. Probability is an epistemic concept
95. Probability is a property of statements, not of states of affairs
96. Probability is inherently relational
97. A complete description of the universe would contain no probability statements
98. Probability is "a measure of ignorance"
99. Probability is a mind-independent logical relationship holding among statements
100. Accidental generalizations don't receive support from their instances; only principled generalizations do

1. Obsessive beliefs are pseudo-beliefs
2. Compulsive acts are pseudo-acts
3. If someone obsesses about hatred of someone, it's because they're still attached to that person
4. Obsessional belief represents the opposite of what one actually believes
5. Compulsive action is driven by an intention to do the opposite of what one's doing
6. The essence of OCD is ambivalence
7. Compulsive love is actually unconscious hatred
8. When unconscious hatred becomes conscious, associated compulsions vanish
9. The obsessional engages in "doing and undoing" due to emotional polarity
10. Obsessive fears often represent disguised desires
11. Doing-and-undoing behavior can mirror the sexual act as displaced libido
12. Compulsive behavior can be overdetermined at one level but have a single determinant at a deeper level
13. Compulsive acts of kindness affect their targets the same way as acts of hostility
14. Unconscious intentions can carry the day over conscious intentions
15. Desire-driven acts lacking values have authenticity but not sublimity
16. Value-driven acts lacking desire have sublimity but not reality
17. Actual actions must embody both beliefs and desires in alignment
18. Compulsive actions consist of two distinct half-actions: one about instinct, one about values
19. To the extent compulsive actions are real, they aren't actions; to the extent they're actions, they aren't real
20. Intentions are judgments as to how to consolidate one's psychological architecture
21. Values are beliefs as to what consolidates one's psychological architecture
22. Locke was wrong that freedom is only a property of actions, not desires
23. Second-order desires can be free or unfree (Frankfurt's insight)
24. One has a free will to the extent that conduct aligns with second-order desires
25. Rational conduct differs from intelligent conduct
26. An irrational act can involve enormous intelligence
27. A rational act embodies due regard for one's various interests
28. Persons, unlike non-persons, subject their own desires to critical scrutiny
29. Free acts require that second-order desires align with first-order desires
30. Freedom consists primarily in being oneself, secondarily in being able to do what one wants
31. People can warp higher-order desires to validate lower-order desires (rationalization)
32. Truly free acts are driven by values, not merely by higher-order desires
33. Values are not desires
34. Liking something differs from valuing it
35. A value is a judgment that a course of action increases the scope of one's agency
36. Giving into impulses isn't inherently bad; healthy impulse-discharge involves considered judgment
37. What appear to be whimsical acts are often non-whimsically approved impulse-expressions
38. Happiness presupposes a value-system
39. Happiness consists in judging oneself to have measured up to certain benchmarks
40. All selves are minds, but not all minds are selves
41. A self is a mind that is an agent
42. An agent is a mind that acts, not just reacts
43. Where there are no values, there are no selves
44. A self is a mind whose behaviors are driven by beliefs as to what is of value
45. Actions are behaviors resulting from judgments about judgments
46. There is no self where there is no self-evaluation
47. Co-corporeal, informationally integrated mental states suffice for a mind but not a self
48. Selfhood requires a regulatory agency under whose jurisdiction mental activity falls
49. Selfhood is a matter of degree
50. What is valuable is what consolidates one's agency
51. Kant's two categorical imperatives (universalizability and respect for autonomy) are not equivalent
52. CI1 (universalizability test) is false
53. CI2 (respect autonomy) is approximately correct
54. A moral principle outweighed is not a moral principle extinguished
55. Moral laws, unlike legal statutes, have a dimension of weight
56. Morality is not binary; obligations can be outweighed
57. Kant wrongly assumed nothing other than a good will has inherent moral worth
58. Autonomy itself must be inherently good if intention to respect autonomy is inherently good
59. Kant's argument linking morality and self-interest involves a massive non-sequitur
60. Rationality is intellectual autonomy
61. Autonomy is practical rationality
62. A creature that doesn't deliberate doesn't decide anything
63. Non-rational creatures don't make choices; they react
64. Agency in the robust sense is identical with rationality, autonomy, and moral responsibility
65. Philosophy justifies assumptions that empirical sciences cannot justify themselves
66. The assumption that senses are accurate cannot be empirically justified
67. Sense-perceptions have two roles: information-transmitting and thought-triggering
68. Mathematical knowledge results from ratiocinative processes triggered by perception, not transmitted by it
69. If perceptions triggering mathematical insight were hallucinations, the knowledge would remain valid
70. Non-empirical knowledge is purely conceptual, concerning structures and interrelations of concepts
71. The claim "there is no philosophical truth" is self-defeating
72. All legitimate knowledge being empirical is false (mathematics disproves it)
73. Disagreement doesn't preclude truth; where there's disagreement, at least one party is wrong
74. Philosophers tend not to admit when they're wrong, thwarting philosophical progress
75. Market forces don't weed out bad philosophers as they weed out bad doctors
76. What passes for philosophical ability in institutions may be mere mimicry of it
77. Brilliant philosophy students often use intellect to defend professors' views rather than seek truth
