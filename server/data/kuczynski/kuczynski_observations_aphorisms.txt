Marx never worked a day in his life. His economic ‘theory’ was simply his

way of saying that he wanted to be given money for doing nothing. The rest

was pure rationalization.

No one lies as much as a redundant bureaucrat.

It is not always possible to determine whether a given conceit is

pathological on the basis of its content. A person’s belief that he failed his

exam may be completely sane or utterly psychotic. The relevant litmus test

is this: Does the conceit in question expand awareness or narrow it? If it

narrows it, then it is pathological. It if expands it, it is non-pathological. A

pathological awareness crowds out legitimate awarenesses. A legitimate

awareness adds to legitimate awarenesses. And even if a person is in the

throes of neurosis, and thus cannot directly determine whether a given

conceit of his is pathological, he does have it in him to know whether his

ideation narrows or enlarges his consciousness, and he can thus indirectly

determine whether that conceit is neurotic.

The reason that the papers in philosophy journals are 19 parts references to

other such papers and only one part content is that philosophy professors

cannot evaluate ideas on their own terms, so they need to have them

embedded in a social context. They need to know who said what, because

they cannot evaluate those statements themselves; they can only evaluate

the social role of those statements. That is why those papers are so boring

and so uninformative. They are not philosophy papers; they are markers in

a social game that is played with bits of philosophy but is not itself

philosophy.

Emotions sometimes harden into character traits. If a given person develops

a tendency to emote in a certain way, he will develop a fixed outlook that

demands that he emote in that way. The emotion in question is no longer

undergone by the subject, and is thus no longer an emotion, as it becomes

the subject, having hardened into a fixed character trait of his.

A man with no money is half a man.

An emotion is a judgment on the subject’s as to how circumstances bear on

his prospects of complying with his values. A value is a judgment on the

subject’s part as to what kinds of actions are conducive to his ownpsychological integrity.

The superior man turns weaknesses into strength and challenges into

triumphs.

Many professors are bureaucrats first and scholars second. They think that

by subordinating scholarship to department politics, they can have their

cake and eat it too—that they can have job-security and possibly even some

acclaim, while also being scholars. This never works. If one is a bureaucrat,

that is all one is; one cannot be both a bureaucrat and a scholar. If one tries

to do this, one’s ‘scholarship’ ends up merely being an extension of one’s

bureaucratism. Obviously, when bureaucrat-pseudo-scholars gather

together, they spend their time convincing one another that what they are

doing is the real thing. But one’s one leaves the bubble these mutual

admiration societies, the lies and illusions contained therein are seen for

what they are. A man cannot serve two masters: one is either a bureaucrat

or a scholar; one cannot be both.

Commercial innovations, no matter how massive, always begin as ways of

optimizing some specific process in some specific way. The problem with

most would-be entrepreneurs is that they start with a big idea and then try

to work out the specifics. But the way to go is to start specific and then

work one’s way up to a larger concept.

Criminality is a form of prolonged infantilism. The Criminal is someone

who never grew up. Suppose that someone wanted to remain a child in the

psychological sense, while making a living. He obviously couldn’t have a

legitimate job. But he could steal and lie and kill. We see children as non-

criminals not because they really are non-criminals, but only because they

are too feeble to carry out their criminality. And we see criminals as non-

children only because they are capable of carrying out their criminality.

It isn’t that the task is hard. It’s that you are only half-doing it.

When we say that a task is ‘easy’, we mean that it is easy to be 100%

engaged in it; and when we say that a task is ‘hard’, we mean that it is hard

to be 100% engaged in it.

There is no case of knowledge, even of knowledge of narrowly factual

nature, the possession of which does not require understanding.

Knowledge

does not precede understanding; knowledge and understanding are coeval.We often rush to judgment as a way of sparing ourselves the trouble of

actually having to act.

Jesus was the opposite of a psychopath, and yet there is no one

psychopaths are more likely to pretend to be like.

Given that that any instance of knowledge is itself a possible object of

knowledge, it follows that the concept of omniscience is incoherent.

Don’t think in terms of what you don’t have. Think in terms of what you

will acquire.

Titles are meant to acknowledge merit, but they are just as often used to

conceal its absence.

In most cases, failure to do such and such is failure to have made a real

attempt to do such and such.

People say that I have a lot of stamina and am unusually perseverant. But

what keeps me going is not so much perseverance as it is curiosity. My

desire to learn makes otherwise unbearable projects bearable.

Psychopathy isn’t the absence of superego. It is the presence of

corrupted superego.

Freedom is freedom from fear.

AUTISM IS ABOUT WITHDRAWL. THE PRE-AUTISTIC

WITHDRAWS INTO THE SAFETY OF HIS OWN CRANIUM

BECAUSE THERE IS AN EXTERNAL THREAT TO HIS

  PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEGRATION. BUREAUCRACIES ARE

ENLARGED, INTERPERSONAL VERSIONS OF THIS SAME

AUTISTIC, PROTECTIVE CACOON, AND THE BUREAUCRAT IS A

  QUASI-AUTISTIC: HE HAS JUST ENOUGH OF A FOOT IN REALITY

TO BE TECHNICALLY FUNCTIONAL AND TO QUALIFY AS

‘INVOLVED’ IN THE WORLD, BUT THAT IS THE END OF IT: HIS

INVOLVEMENT IN THE REAL WORLD IS PURELY FORMAL, THAT

BEING WHY HIS BEHAVIOR, WHILE ALWAYS BEING RULE-

COMPLIANT, IS UTTERLY DEVOID OF PRINCIPLE.

A  PERSON’S  BEHAVIOR  AND  PERSONALITY  ARE,  TO  A

VERY  CONSIDERABLE  EXTENT,  TO  BE  UNDERSTOOD  IN

TERMS OF WHERE HE FALLS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.

NOBODY WHOSE SUCCESS WITHIN A BUREAUCRACY DEPENDS

ON HIS SUPPRESING HIS PERSONALITY IS GOING TO SUCCEED

WITHIN THAT BUREAUCRACY. SUCCEEDING WITHIN A

  BUREAUCRACY IS ABOUT BEING DAMAGED GOODS AB INITIO,

SO THAT ONE’S MEMBERSHIP IN THAT BUREAUCRACY IS

EMPOWERING, NOT DISEMPOWERING.

PEOPLE’S BODIES MIRROR THEIR SELF-IMAGES.

BUREAUCRATS AND PSYCHOPATHS SLOUCH, AND HAVE SHIT-

EATING GRINS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR PERSONALITIES ARE

BROKEN AND, FOR THEM, LIFE IS IDENTICAL WITH EATING

SHIT.

PEOPLE’S BEHAVIOR TOWARDS OTHERS REFLECTS THEIR

ATTITUDE TOWARDS THEMSELVES. BUREAUCRATS AND

OTHER BROKESTERS TEND NOT TO LOOK YOU IN THE EYE. IN

ACTUALITY, THEY ARE NOT LOOKING THEMSELVES IN THE

EYE.

PEOPLE ARE AS DISHONEST WITH THEMSELVES AS THEY ARE

WITH OTHERS, AND AS HONEST WITH THEMSELVES AS THEY

ARE WITH OTHERS.IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL A LIE WITHOUT HALF-BELIEVING IT.

SUCCESS DEPENDS ON HAVING A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF

THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TRUTH AND FICTION. SUCCEESS

WITHIN A BUREAUCRACY DOES NOT SO DEPEND, BUT ONLY

BECAUSE SUCCESS WITHIN A BUREAUCRACY IS NOT REAL

SUCCESS.

WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THE VARIOUS PROFESSORS THAT I

WORKED WITH AND STUDIED UNDER, AND I ASK MYSELF

‘WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN HAD THEY NOT BEEN

PROFESSORS?’, I DRAW A BLANK. I DRAW A BLANK BECAUSE

THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO BE DRAWN. THESE PEOPLE COULD

NOT POSSIBLY FUNCTION IN ANY ENVIRONMENT WHERE

WASN’T COMPLETE AND TOTAL PREDICTABILITY. IN OTHER

WORDS, THESE PEOPLE ARE ONLY PSEUDO-FUNCTIONAL. THEY

COULD NOT EVEN BE BUTLERS OR HIGH LEVEL SERVANTS,

SINCE SUCH POSITIONS REQUIRE A CERTAIN JUDGMENT AND

MORAL COMPASS NOT HAD BY THESE PROFESSORS. THE ONLY

ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ‘WHAT COULD THEY HAVE BEEN?’

IS ‘WHAT THEY IN FACT ARE’---BUREAUCRATS OF SOME KIND,

IN OTHER WORDS.

PSYCHOSIS IS THE NON-AUTISTIC’S WAY OF EFFECTUATING

THE WITHDRAWL FROM REALITY THAT IS AUTISM.

NEUROSIS IS ABOUT REMAINING FIRMLY WITHIN REALITY

BUT AVAILING ONESELF OF MINITIARIZED, CONTEXT-SPECIFIC

FORMS OF THE TACTICAL RETREATS FROM REALITY

CHARACTERISTIC OF BOTH THE AUTISTIC AND PSYCHOTIC.

A FEMALE STUDENT OF MINE, IN AN ETHICS CLASS I WAS

TEACHING, ASKED, IN A SINCERE WAY, WHETHER BEING A

PORN ACTRESS WAS MORALLY BAD. AT THE TIME, I WAS

PURITANICAL AND WAS RELUCTANT TO SAY ‘YES.’ IN ANY

CASE, I ANSWERED CORRECTLY, SAYING: IT IS BAD IF, IN

DOING IT, ONE IS SELLING OUT; OTHERWISE, IT ISN’T BAD. MY

POSITION NOW IS THAT, IF ONE IS STRONGLY SEXUAL, ONE

SHOULD FIND A WAY TO INTEGRATE THAT INTO ONE’S

CAREER. IF ONE TRIES TO ISOLATE ONE’S PROFESSIONAL

ENDEAVORS FROM ONE’S SEXUALITY, PARTICULARLY IFONE’S SEXUALITY IS POWERFUL,

WHICH INDICATES THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF ONE’S

IDENTITY, THE RESULT WILL BE TO WITHDRAW THE SUPPORT

OF ONE’S PERSONALITY-STRUCTURE FROM ONE’S CAREER.

THE RESULT, CONSEQUENTLY, WILL BE TO DRAIN ONE’S

CAREER OF VITALITY. THIS IS SUBJECT TO THE

QUALIFICATION THAT MUCH BEHAVIOR THAT IS OVERTLY

SEXUAL IS EITHER INDICATIVE OF AN ABSENCE OF GENUINE

SEXUALITY OR IS AN ATTEMPT TO DESEXUALIZE ONE’S

PERSONALITY BY EXTERNALIZING ONE’S SEXUALITY.

Professors are parasites pretending not to be parasites.

One of the causes of the explosion of relativism and new-ageism in the 60’s

is that, after World War II, higher education was made available to people

who couldn’t benefit from it and who were only confounded by the ideas

they encountered when in college. So they reacted defensively, by

attempting to relativize those confusing truths away.

People who don’t second-guess themselves go far. Those who do, don’t.

Extroverts derive energy from other people; and for them, a spouse and

children are springboards. Introverts generate their own energy supply; and

for them, a spouse and children are obstacles.

The introvert makes his own decisions and therefore has free will; but his

emotional gas tank is empty, since people ultimately have to draw their

energy from others. The extrovert’s emotional gas tank is full, since he

allows himself to derive energy from others; but he also lets others make

his decisions for him and therefore does not have free will.

The introvert decompensates by becoming neurotic. The extrovert

decompensates by becoming psychotic.

Many a paranoia is an insane way of being sane. Your insane fear that

you will get life in prison for selling small amounts of pot is the way in

which your mind is giving the sane message that you should find a new

line of work.

What we refer to as ‘self-confidence’ isn’t so much belief in self as it is a

resolution to act. Having such a resolution is not so much a symptom of

self- confidence as it is itself self-confidence, and failure to have such a

resolution is not so much a symptom of a lack of self-confidence as it is

itself such a lack.

What we refer to as ‘emotion’ is really knowledge that is hewed to an

egocentric frame of reference, and what we refer to as ‘knowledge’ is

knowledge that is hewed to a non-egocentric---non-person-specific—

frame of reference. This is why knowledge, i.e. non-egocentric

knowledge, is not

by itself capable of motivating action. The frame of reference embodied in

any intention to act is necessarily egocentric; and if non-egocentric is to becapable of motivating action, it has to be integrated with judgments that are

hewed to an egocentric frame of reference and so must be coupled with

emotions.

Don’t stew. Do.

As a writer, never second-guess your intuitions. Write what your muse tells

you to write, without question. After you write it, you will see that it

coheres, even though it initially seemed that what your muse was asking

you to write would be incoherent.

The introvert decompensates by becoming a criminal. The extrovert

decompensates by becoming a bureaucrat.

Morality does more to direct rationalizations than it does to direct conduct.

Geniuses focus on what is internal and therefore have a tendency to live

simply and austerely. Unintelligent people focus on what is external and

therefore tend to live in a more flashy, display-oriented way. If you are

cerebral person whose line of work is sales, sell abstract products, such as

insurance polices or financial products; don't sell cars or houses, since you

won't be able to relate to your customers. The very things they see as

selling points will be the things you see as useless embellishments.

A good indicator of how well liked you are by the management at your

place of work is how well secretaries and other low level employees treat

you.

Management tends to be diplomatic and deceptive. Low level pseudo-white

collar employees function as confidants of the higher-ups; so they know the

score. And they are weak and sycophantic; so they will take advantage of

every opportunity to placate you or spurn you, depending on whether the

management likes you or dislikes you.

First rule of sales: Get a job at a place where there are customers. Sales is

mainly about being where buyers are. It is only to a very limited extent about

being a good salesman.

One mistake that geniuses make that non-geniuses don't make is to believe

that it is about merit, as opposed to being at the right place at the right

time. Geniuses think that it's about what you know; non-geniuses know

that it's about who you know.

There are crimes against individuals, and there are crimes against morality

itself. People who are truly evil have morality itself for their target.

Oftentimes such people were once good; in such cases, they are now as

evil as they were once good. And this proves that evil is not an absence of

superego, but a rebellion against superego. It is also explains why it is

that bureaucrats who can usually excuse their corrupt behavior on the

grounds that they are under political pressure to so behave nonetheless

behave in the

worst possible way even when they are under little or no pressure to so

behave: such people have become fundamentally rotten, andfundamentally rotten people do whatever they can to undermine the

moral standards with respect to which they fail so utterly.

A stable set of mediocre values is better than a variable set of good values.

Making money is about doing whatever it takes. Necessity knows no law.

Selling out is not a form of making money. Selling out is about acquiring

money without making it.

Politically driven statements are statements made under duress and are

therefore to be given no credence.

When there is objective danger, retreat. When there is subjective danger,

push forward.

An ounce of self-change is worth a pound of strenuous labor.

It is only through bitter experiences that we see reality as it is. To the

extent that our experiences are good, our understanding of the world is

based on self-serving rationalizations.

No one who has money gives it away. Thus when people who don’t have

money claim to spurn wealth, it is because they are too lazy to make money

and are trying to make a virtue out of this failing of theirs.

Always be on the offensive.

The impersonal part of the mind either knows or doesn’t know. It doesn’t

doubt; nor, therefore, does it believe. It doesn’t suspect or conjecture.

Doubt, belief, and other such attitudes involve agency; they are to be

understood not in epistemic, but in agent-theoretic terms.

The  mindset  of  someone  with  a  defensive  attitude  towards  reality  is

reality- avoidant and therefore delusive. The mindset of someone with an

offensive attitude towards reality is reality-non-avoidant and therefore

non-delusive.

Insomnia is a consequence of a defensive attitude towards reality.

A morbid fear of aging is a consequence of a defensive attitude towards

reality.

The neurotic has correct beliefs, but his emotions are not aligned with

them. They are aligned with unconscious desires. The psychotic's emotions

are aligned with his beliefs, but his beliefs are false.You cannot be happy if you don't like your job.

Psychosis often begins when a person's actual situation is similar to the sort

of situation in which a psychotically deluded person believes himself to be

in. This weakens the subject’s ability to distinguish between bona fide

reality and psychotic pseudo-reality, and it encourages him to give to give

credence to his delusions. Consequently, he no longer inhibits those

delusions, and they take over. In a word, psychosis begins when psychotic

pseudo-reality coincides with actual reality, and that convergence creates a

kind of portal through which the subject passes from sanity into madness.

It is when you are least inclined to be calm that you most have to be.

Hope is for people who have none.

Paranoia and counterphobia are two sides of the same coin. The person

who deals with fear by being excessively fearless is the same person who,

when not overcompensating for his fears, is devoured by paranoia.

There is a blue-collar cognitive configuration and a white collar cognitive

configuration. The blue-collar configuration is appropriate for physical

work, be it skilled or unskilled in nature; and the white collar configuration

is appropriate for tasks of a symbolic or logical nature. When someone of a

blue-collar configuration is employed in a white collar capacity, he tends to

be a bureaucrat--inappropriately rigid and a stickler for procedure.

Skepticism is a resolution to never have to change one's mind.

The skeptic is secretly hyper-credulous: a given person adopts skepticism

to combat a tendency to over-believe.

One of the characteristics of OCD is a tendency to polarize---to think in 'all

or nothing' terms. 'Either I will get my paycheck today or the company is

ripping me off.' 'Either I get into Harvard or I'm finished.' Why is this a

characteristic of OCD? Because OCD is about not confronting the world;

the obsessions have the effect, and the purpose, of preventing the obsessive-

compulsive from engaging the world. And in a given case of black-or-white

thought, neither of the extremes requires action on the obsessive-

compulsive's part. The good extreme is so good that nothing has to be done

('If I get into Harvard, I won't ever have to do anything; I'll just have to

coast'). And the bad extreme is represented as so bad that nothing can be

done ('If I don't get into Harvard, then there is no point in doing anything').

Action must be taken when, and only when, things are good enough that

there is hope but not so good that one needn't do anything. And the

obsessive- compulsive doesn't want to do anything; he wants to remain in

his bubble.

 

The how is discovered before the what. One starts off trying to improve

some existing technology or method (e.g. one starts out trying to sell more

insurance than the next insurance salesman), and to that end one invents

something new, e.g. a new kind of robot or a new kind of e-commerceplatform, whose significance far exceeds the purpose for which it was

originally invented.

All decompensation is regression. When one regresses, the symptoms of

whatever psychological

maladies one has flare up. But these symptoms are just that---symptoms.

They don’t constitute the regression. The regression itself consists in the

subject’s withdrawing from reality into fantasy. All psychological

symptoms, it will be noticed, involve a withdrawal from the real into the

imaginary. In having obsessions and compulsions, the obsessive-

compulsive is confining is thought and conduct to a tiny sphere in which

his thoughts are accorded the same value as veritable deeds. In having

paranoias, the paranoiac is living in a bubble in which he needs only

suspect it, and therefore think it, to make it  so. The symptom, no matter

what it is—anxiety, lethargy, mania, obsessional ideation, depression---

always steers the subject off a reality-oriented track into a self-contained

emotional bubble.

ALL OF THE INFINITELY MANY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS THAT I

HAVE ARE WAYS OF HAVING THE SAME THOUGHT, AND THAT

IS THE THOUGHT THAT I DON’T WANT TO DIE.

WRITERS WHO DON’T HAVE WRITER’S BLOCK KNOW THAT,

WHENEVER A THOUGHT OCCURS TO THEM, THEY MUST

IMMEDIATELY WRITE IT DOWN. BY FOLLOWING THIS

PRACTICE, THEY NEVER RUN OUT OF MATERIAL. THE FLIP SIDE

IS THAT, WHENEVER THEY HAVE A THOUGHT, WHICH IS ALL

THE TIME, THEY HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN. THE BLOCKED

WRITER IS IN A VERY BAD PLACE, OBVIOUSLY, BUT THE NON-

BLOCKED WRITER IS IN A HAMSTER’S WHEEL OF HIS OWN

DEVISING. IN ANY CASE, PART OF THE REASON THAT SOME

PEOPLE HAVE WRITER’S BLOCK IS THAT, IF THEY DIDN’T, THEN,

AS THEY KNOW, THEY WOULD BE ON THE PERPETUAL

TREADMILL THAT THE NON- BLOCKED WRITER IS ON.

DON’T THINK OF YOUR LIFE-SPAN AS A PRE-EXISTING VESSEL.

THINK IN TERMS OF THE PRESENT AND HOW, AT THIS VERY

MOMENT, YOU CAN EXPAND YOUR BEING. AT EACH MOMENT,

THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GROW. DON’T THINK ABOUT

HOW YOU CAN FILL THE ENVELOPE OF YOUR EXISTENCE.

THINK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN PUSH THE ENVELOPE OF YOUR

EXISTENCE.

SERIAL KILLERS AND OTHER SUPREMELY EVIL PEOPLE

INVARIABLY HAD TERRIBLE CHILDHOODS. BUT THEIR

BACKSTORIES ARE EXPLANATIONS, NOT JUSTIFICATIONS.

THEIR WAY OF DEALING WITH THEIR CHILDHOOD TRAUMAS

WAS TO BECOME THE EVIL THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE

TRAUMAS. SO THEIR WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT EVIL WAS

TO BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR IT AND, THEREFORE, TO CEASE

TO BE INNOCENT VICTIMS.

PEOPLE WANT SEX, AND THEY DON’T WANT TO DIE. THOSE

TWO

FACTS ARE THE BASIS OF ALL SUCCESSFUL MARKETING.BEFORE FOUNDING THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY, L. RON

HUBBARD ATTEMPTED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

  ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURES, MOST OF THEM FAILURES. HE

WAS A SUCCESSFUL SCIENCE-FICTION WRITER, BUT

SCIENTOLOGY WAS HIS FIRST COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL

VENTURE. ON THE BASIS OF THESE FACTS, IT IS SAID THAT L.

RON HUBBARD WAS A CON-MAN, A FLIM-FLAM ARTIST AND

THAT SCIENTOLOGY WAS JUST A SCAM THAT HAPPENED TO

WORK. I BELIEVE THIS ANALYSIS TO BE QUITE ERRONEOUS.

GIVEN THAT L. RON HUBBARD WAS INDEED A GOOD SCIENCE

FICTION WRITER, AND GIVEN ALSO THAT HIS PRE-

SCIENTOLOGY COMMERCIAL VENTURES FAILED, THE

CONCLUSION TO DRAW IS THAT HE WAS A WRITER, A

THINKER, A COMMUNICATOR--- NOT A BUSINESSMAN. AND IT

IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A LIVING AS A THINKER

UNLESS THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH ONE COMMUNICATES

IS ORGANIZED RELIGION. ACADEMICS, THOUGH WIDELY

REGARDED AS THINKERS, ARE NOT THINKERS; THEY ARE

BUREAUCRATS AND GIMPS, ALBEIT ONES WHO, IN ORDER TO

PLY THEIR PSEUDO-TRADES, HAVE TO DO SOME THINKING

(THOUGH FAR LESS THAN IS COMMONLY ASSUMED). SETTING

ASIDE A FEW RESEARCHERS IN MEDICINE AND ENGINEERING,

THE ONLY THINKERS WHO MAKE MONEY ARE EXPONENTS OF

RELIGIOUS CAUSES. AND SCIENTOLOGY, I MUST THEREFORE

CONCLUDE, WAS, AT LEAST AT ITS OUTSET, A LEGITIMATE

VENTURE. NOTHING ABOUT L. RON HUBBARD’S CHARACTER,

OR ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OFHIS MOTIVES IN FOUNDING

SCIENTOLOGY, IS TO BE INFERRED FROM THE FACT THAT,

EVENTUALLY, AND MOSTLY AFTER HUBBARD’S DEATH, THE

CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY DID IN FACT BECOME CORRUPT.

ACADEMICS WANT PREDICTABILITY. THEREFORE, THE

NEUROTICS ALMOST ALWAYS GIVE INTO THEIR NEUROSES.

THEY ATTEMPT TO APPEASE THEM. THEY SEEK ASSURANCES

AND AFFIRMATIONS. BUT ASSURANCES AND AFFIRMATIONS

MERELY STOKE THE FLAMES OF THE MORBIDIGIES

UNDERLYING THE INSECURITIES AND DOUBTS THEY ARE

ATTEMPTING TO ELIMINATE. INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING

SPECIFIC DOUBTS AND SPECIFIC INSECURITIES, THE NEUROTIC

SHOULD ELIMINATE HIS INSECURITY AS A WHOLE AND HIS

CONCOMITANT TENDENCY TO DOUBT.

PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER GROWING HAVE NO MORALITY.

PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF OPTIONS

HAVE NO MORALITY.

PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CASTRATED HAVE NO

MORALITY. A BUREAUCRAT IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN

CASTRATED,

AND SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN CASTRATED IS A BUREAUCRAT.

ONE CONSEQUENCE OF RELIGION---AND THEREFORE, IN

ALL LIKELIHOOD, ONE OF ITS FUNCTIONS---IS THAT THOSE

WHO ARE RELIGIOUS NEVER SEE THEMSELVES AS BEING

ENTIRELY WITHOUT OPTIONS, IN CONSEQUENCE OF

WHICH THEY NEVER COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR

WILLINGNESS TO BE MORAL.

IRONICALLY, A NUMBER OF THE ILLIBERAL AND INTOLERANT

ASPECTS OF RELIGION PERTAIN NOT TO RELIGION PER SE AS

TO ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE WITH A RATIONALISTIC,

PROGRESSIVE, AND LIBERAL BASIS. THE RIGID AND CRUEL

DOGMAS OF RELIGIOUS FAITHS EMBODY ATTEMPTS LONG

AGO TO PROVIDE THOSE FAITHS WITH A RATIONAL AND

LEGALISTIC BASIS. THE SITUATION PARALLELS THAT OF THE

CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS INTHE UNITED STATES. ORIGINALLY, HATE SPEECH LAWS WERE

MEANT TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF LIBERAL TOLERANCE,

BUT THOSE LAWS ENDED CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE OF

ILLIBERAL INTOLERANCE.

MORALITY SHOULD AFFIRM, NOT UNDERMINE.

THE INSTITUTION OF TENURE SHIELDS PROFESSORS FROM THE

CONSEQUENCES OF SHODDY SCHOLARHIP AND SCHODDY

CONDUCT, AND IT THEREFORE DRAINS THEIR RESPECTIVE

DISCIPLINES OF ALL LEGITIMACY AND VITALITY.

PEOPLE HAVE MORALITY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE ARE

CONSEQUENCES FOR IMMORALITY.

PEOPLE HAVE INITIATIVE ONLY AS LONG AS THERE ARE

CONSEQUENCES FOR LACKING IT.

PEOPLE WHO DON’T HAVE INITIATIVE DO NOT TOLERATE IT IN

OTHERS.

PEOPLE WHO LACK CREATIVITY DO NOT TOLERATE IT IN

OTHERS.

OFTENTIMES OBSESSIONAL HATRED OF A GIVEN PERSON

HAS TO DO WITH ENVY OF SOME ASPECT OF THEIR

EXISTENCE.

HERE IS AN EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN LIFE. I USED TO WORK

WITHIN A PARTICULARLY PERFIDIOUS BUREAUCRACY.

RECENTLY I FOUND MYSELF SEETHING OVER THE VARIOUS

SLIGHTS I ENDURED WHILE THEREIN EMPLOYED. THEN I

REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE ABOUT WHOM I WAS SEETHING

ALL HAD SOMETHING THAT I VERY MUCH WANT AND DO NOT

CURRENTLY HAVE---JOB-SECURITY, FINANCIAL SECURITY, A

GUARANTEE OF FOOD, LODGING, AND BASIC AMENITIES. AND

THOUGH THESE PEOPLE ARE OBJECTIVELY DESPICABLE, THAT

DOES NOT BY ITSELF ACCOUNT FOR THE RUMINATIVE AND

PERSISTENT NATURE OF MY HATRED OF THEM. NOR DOES IT

ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT MY HITHERTO DORMANT

HATRED OF THEM BECAME ACTIVE THE MOMENT MY

FINANCES FELL APART AND, AS A RESULT, I ONCE AGAIN HAD

REASON TO COVET THE SECURITY OF EMPLOYMENT WITHIN A

BUREAUCRACY.

BUT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO THIS IS NOT TO RETURN

TO THE NECROTIC SAFETY OF EMPLOYMENT WITHIN A

BUREAUCRACY; IT IS TO REDOUBLE MY EFFORTS TO BE

  INDEPENDENT OF SUCH EMPLOYMENT AND TO SUCCEED AS

AN ENTREPRENEUR.

AND THIS LAST FACT IS SIGNIFICANT. HAD IT BEEN MY

WHOLEHEARTED WISH TO RETURN TO LIFE AS A BUREAUCRAT,

I WOULD NOT HAVE RESPONDED TO THE COLLAPSE OF MY

FINANCES BY SEETHING OVER THE BUREAUCRATS WHO HAD

SNUBBED ME OVER THE PAST. AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD

NOT HAVE RESPONDED THAT WAY HAD IT BEEN MY

  WHOLEHEARTED DESIRE NOT TO RETURN TO LIFE AS A

BUREAUCRAT. I RESPONDED WITH OBSESSIONAL, AND

THEREFORE DISPLACED, EMOTION PRECISELY BECAUSE I WASAMBIVALENT AND HAD NOT COMPLETELY RECONCILED

MYSELF TO A PARTICULAR COURSE OF ACTION. I WAS

MOVING FORWARD BUT LOOKING BACK. HAD I SIMPLY BEEN

LOOKING BACK, I WOULD HTEN HAVE STARTED MOVING

BACK. AND I HAD I SIMPLY BEEN MOVING FORWARD, I WOULD

HAVE STOPPED LOOKING BACK. BUT BECAUSE I WAS FENCE-

SITTING, MY EMOTIONS WERE NOT IN PERFECT ALLIGNMENT

WITH MY ACTIONS, AND MY EMOTIONS THEREFORE HAD TO

ASSUME EGO-DYSTONIC FORMS.

IN GENERAL, MORBID AFFECTS ARE ALIENATED AFFECTS;

THEY ARE AFFECTS THAT PERTAIN TO DESIRES THAT ONE

NEITHER COMPLETELY IDENTIFIES WITH NOR COMPLETELY

ESCHEWS. CONTRARIWISE, WHEN ONE IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY

INTEGRATED, ONE’S EMOTIONS DO NOT TAKE THE FORM OF

OBSESSIONS AND ARE NOT OTHERWISE MORBID OR

DYSFUNCTIONAL.

EMOTIONS ARE NOT MERE FEELINGS. THEY ARE WINDOWS TO

THE SOUL. SCHISMS WITHIN ONE’S OWN PSYCHE DISPLACE

ONE’S EMOTIONS AND THUS RENDER THOSE WINDOWS

OPAQUE. BUT THE VERY FACT THAT THEY ARE OPAQUE IS

ITSELF A WINDOW INTO ONE’S PSYCHE, ALBEIT ONE THAT

MUST BE LOOKED THROUGH PSYCHOANALYTICALLY IF IT IS

TO BE LOOKED THROUGH AT ALL.

FEELINGS ARE ALWAYS AUTHENTIC. THOUGHTS ARE SELDOM

SO. SO IF IT IS ONE’S RESOLUTION AS A WRITER TO REPORT

ONE’S FEELINGS, ONE WILL NEVER HAVE WRITER’S BLOCK. IF

IT IS ONE’S RESOLUTION TO REPORT ONE’S JUDGMENTS, ONE

WILL HAVE WRITER’S BLOCK, UNLESS IT IS ONLY TO THE

EXTENT THAT ONE MUST REPORT ONE’S JUDGMENTS IN

ORDER TO REPORT ONE’S FEELINGS THAT ONE DOES THE

FORMER.

IF ONE IS HONEST WITH ONESELF, ONE HAS ACCESS TO ONE’S

OWN POWERS. IF ONE ISN’T, ONE DOESN’T.

IT TAKES EXTREME INTELLIGENCE TO SPEAK FROM THE

HEART. A TRUE WRITER IS SOMEONE WHO HAS A HEART AND

ALSO HASTHE INTELLIGENCE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK FROM IT.

                                       Chapter 11

 

IF YOU PRAY FOR WISDOM, GOD WILL ANSWER YOUR

PRAYERS. IF YOU PRAY FOR STRENGTH, GOD WILL ANSWER

YOUR PRAYERS. IF YOU PRAY FOR WEALTH, GOD MAY

ANSWER YOUR PRAYERS.

IF YOU HAVE A PURE HEART, YOU WILL REACH YOUR

DESTINATION. IF YOU DON’T, YOU WON’T.

 

GOD DOESN’T ALWAYS GIVE ANSWER YOUR PRAYERS. BUT HE

ALWAYS LISTENS TO THEM.

 

PRAY IS NOT ABOUT TALKING TO GOD. IT IS ABOUT TALKING

TO YOURSELF THROUGH GOD.

 

WHEN YOU REACH OUT, GOD REACHES BACK.

 

THE PURPOSE OF PRAYER IS TO FIND ONE’S INNER STRENGTH.

THE CHRISTIAN GOD IS A SHIELD, NOT A SWORD.

PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS HONEST. THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS

HONEST WITH THEMSLEVES. BUT IN EVERY MAN’S LIFE,

THERE MUST BE ONE THING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PURE, ONE

THING ABOUT WHICH HE IS ABSOLUTELY HONEST. IF HE HAS

THAT, HE HAS EVERYTHING. IF HE DOESN’T, HE HAS NOTHING.

 

PEOPLE ARE CREATIVE WHEN THEY ARE OPEN, AND THEY ARE

BARREN WHEN THEY ARE CLOSED.

 

PEOPLE ARE STRONG WHEN THEY ARE A PART OF SOMETHING

LARGER THAN THEMSELVES, AND WEAK WHEN THEY ARE

NOT.

 

THE PURPOSE OF PRAYER IS TO MAKE ONESELF WHOLE.

PRAYER IS ABOUT TRUTHFULNESS TO ONESELF. 

SEEK STRENGTH AND YOU SHALL FIND IT, AND YOU SHALL

ALSO FIND ADVANTAGE. SEEK ADVANTAGE WITHOUT

SEEKING STRENGTH, AND YOU SHALL FIND NEITHER.

 

‘I PITIED MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING SHOES’ THE SAYING GOES,

‘UNTIL I MET A MAN WHO HAD NO FEET.’ STRENGTH LIES IN

WHAT YOU HAVE, NOT IN WHAT YOU DON’T HAVE. ENVY IS

ABOUT SUFFERING FOR WHAT LACK. WISDOM IS ABOUT

BENEFITING FROM WHAT YOU HAVE.

UNTIL YOU HAVE NOTHING, YOU HAVE SOMETHING. AND AS

LONG AS YOU HAVE SOMETHING, YOU CAN HAVE

EVERYTHING.

 

GOD WANTS YOU TO BE HAPPY. BUT HE WANTS YOU TO BE

HAPPY BY BEING WHAT YOU ARE, NOT WHAT YOU ARE NOT.

                                       Chapter 12

 

NO ONE WHO IS SELF-RELIANT IS DEPRESSED.

IF YOU ARE DEPRESSED, DO THE FOLLOWING TWO THINGS

AND YOU WILL STOP BEING DEPRESSED. TAKE A COLD

SHOWER EVERY MORNING AND WALK FIVE MILES EVERY

DAY.

A MODEST AMOUNT OF WORK TURNS INFINITE PROBLEMS

INTO FINITE ONES.

WHENEVER I AM OVERWHELMED, IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT

FOCUSED MY ENERGIES ON A SINGLE PROBLEM. WHENEVER A

SINGLE PROBLEM IS NOT ISOLATED AND WORKED ON, ONE’S

VARIOUS PROBLEMS MOULD TOGETHER AND FORM AN

AMORPHOUS MASS THAT, PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS SO ILL-

DEFINED, CANNOT BE DEALT WITH IN ANY OBVIOUS WAY

AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ENDS UP SEEMING INFINITE AND

INTRACTABLE. CONTRARIWISE, WHEN PROBLEMS ARE

ISOLATED, AND DEALT WITH ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, THEY

PROVE TO BE FINITE AND MANAGEABLE.

WHEN I FIND THAT A GIVEN PROBLEM SEEMS

OVERWHELMING, I FIND, UPON REFLECTION, THAT I AM NOT

REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT ONE PROBLEM ALONE. I FIND

THAT I AM TRYING TO SOLVE SEVERAL PROBLEMS, OF WHICH

THAT PROBLEM IS BUT ONE. AND IF I TRULY ISOLATE THAT

PROBLEM, I FIND THAT IT IS SOLVEABLE. FOCUS YOUR

ENERGIES. SOLVE ONE PRECISELY DEFINED PROBLEM AT A

GIVEN TIME. IF YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL STEADILY MAKE

REAL PROGRESS. AND YOU WILL LATER FIND THAT,

CONTRARY TO FIRST APPEARANCES, THIS STEADY IS, INDEED,

QUITE FAST. IN ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE SEVERAL PROBLEMS

AT ONCE, ONE IS NOT REALLY ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE ANY

PROBLEMS. IN ANY ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE A SINGLE

NARROWLY DEFINED PROBLEM AT A GIVEN TIME, ONE IS

INDEED TRYING TO PROBLEM-SOLVE AND, MOREOVER, ONE’S

EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION WILL SUCCEED.

A RELIGION SHOULD PROVIDE ITS FOLLOWERS WITH SPECIFIC,PRACTICAL TIPS AS TO HOW TO LIVE. THESE SHOULD NOT

TAKE THE FORM OF RULES, BUT THEY SHOULD BE STATED

AND INSISTED UPON; AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION SHOULD LIE

IN THEIR PRACTICAL RESULTS. PRACTITIONERS OF A GIVEN

RELIGION SHOULD BE GIVEN USEFUL AND PROVEN ADVICE AS

TO WHEN TO SLEEP, WHEN TO RISE, WHEN TO WORK, WHEN TO

REST, WHEN TO JOKE, WHEN TO BE SERIOUS, AND SO ON.

THESE PRACTICAL TIPS SHOULD BE EMBEDDED IN LARGER

CONCEITS OF A LARGER EXISTENTIAL KIND. BUT SUCH

LARGER EXISTENTIAL CONCEITS ARE DRAINED OF VITALITY

AND SIGNIFICANCE UNLESS ANCHORED TO LIFESTYLE

SUGGESTIONS OF A DEMONSTRABLY PRACTICAL AND

USEABLE KIND.

A MINISTER’S AUTHORITY SHOULD DERIVED NOT FROM HIS

TITLE OR HIS POSITION, BUT FROM HIS EXAMPLE.

A RELIGION SHOULD CONSIST NOT SO MUCH OF STRICTLY

DEFINED RULES AS OF PRECEPTS THAT EMBODY A CERTAIN

ETHOS AND THAT, MOREOVER, ARE PROVEN TO IMPROVE

ONE’S DAY TO DAY EXISTENCE. A RELIGION SHOULD BE WHAT

RELIGIONS USED TO BE: A LARGER VISION OF REALITY,

COUPLED WITH SANE AND PRACTICAL TIPS AS TO HOW ABIDE

BY THAT VISION IN ONE’S DAY TO DAY LIFE. A RELIGION THAT

CONSISTS OF RIGID RULES WITH NO CLEAR PRACTICAL

JUSTIFICATION IS NOTHING MORE THAN A COLLECTIVE

NEUROSIS AND THEREFORE A MERE ENCUMBRANCE. ON THE

OTHER HAND, A RELIGION IS VACUOUS AND LACKING IN

DEPTH AND MORALITY AUTHORITY IF ITS CONSISTS OF ONLY

OF GRAND ETHICAL AND METAPHYSICAL CONCEITS THAT ARE

NOT ROOTED IN SPECIFIC TIPS AS TO HOW TO OPTIMIZE ONE’S

DAY TO DAY EXISTENCE.

THE HARDEST, AND ALSO THE MORE USEFUL, KIND OF WORK

IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE ONE’S INTELLIGENCE TO

IMPROVE ONE’S PRACTICAL SITUATION. BEING A GREAT

THEORETICIAN IS ABOUT HAVING A RANDOM KNACK. BEING

ABLE TO PRESS ONE’S INTELLIGENCE INTO THE SERVICE OF

PRACTICAL OBJECTIVES IS ABOUT CHARACTER.                                       Chapter 13

 

NOTHING IS AS MUCH A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AS THE

ABILITY TO ACT UNDER CONDITIONS OF UNCERTAINTY.

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXTERNAL CONDITIONS IS PROJECTIVE

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ONESELF.

TO ACT IN CONDITIONS OF COMPLETE CERTAINTY AND

PREDICTABILITY IS NOT REALLY TO ACT AT ALL. IT IS TO

REACT. IT IS ONLY WHEN THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF

SUCCESS THAT GENUINE ACTION IS POSSIBLE.

THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF SELF-IMPROVEMENT, AND

THEREFORE OF SELF-CONQUEST, TO ALL CASES OF GENUINE

ACTION.

TO A PURE HEART, GOD IS EVERYWHERE.

SOME GREAT THINKERS CLAIM TO BE ATHEISTS, BUT THERE IS

NO GREAT THINKER WHO DOES NOT SECRETLY REGARD HIS

INTELLECT AS A BLESSING PERSONALLY BESTOWED ON HIM

BY A HIGHER POWER.

MARRIAGE CONNECTS ONE TO ONESELF BY CONNECTING ONE

TO SOMETHING LARGER THAN ONESELF.

WHAT WE REFER TO AS ATHEISM IS A DISBELIEF NOT IN GOD

BUT IN A GOD THAT CONFORMS TO SOME PRECONCEPTION AS

TO WHAT GOD IS.

THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN A HIGHER POWER HAVE COURAGE;

THOSE WHO DON’T, DON’T.

MORALITY IS ABOUT PERSONAL CHOICE. LAW IS ABOUT ITS

ABSENCE.

MAN’S LAWS RESTRICT. GOD’S LAWS LIBERATE.

DON’T PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS. PRAY TO BE SOMEONE WHO

DOES NOT HAVE TO BE FORGIVEN.

NO  ONE  WHO  GENUINELY  ASPIRES  TO  IMPROVE  HIMSELF

CAN HAVE AN EMPTY LIFE.

IF  ONE  PURSUES  FULFILLMENT,  AS  OPPOSED  TO  COMFORT,ONE  WILL  HAVE  BOTH.  IF  ONE  PERSUES  COMFORTS,  AS

OPPOSED TO FULFILLMENT, ONE WILL HAVE NEITHER.

IT IS INHERENT IN WHAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE THAT THEY

HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE VALUE, NOT THAT THEY

ACTUALLY HAVE VALUE. AND ONE CANNOT ACTUALIZE

ONE’S POTENTIAL VALUE WITHOUT FIRST ACKNOWLEDGING

THAT FACT.

TO ONE WHO SEES, NO EXPLANATION IS NECESSARY. TO ONE

WHO IS BLIND, NO EXPLANATION IS POSSIBLE.

  EXPLANATIONS ARE USEFUL TO THOSE WHOSE VISION IS

SKEWED, BUT NOT TO THOSE ARE BLIND.

AVOID THE COMPANY OF FOOLS.

JUDGE A MAN BY THE COMPANY HE KEEPS.

THE SUPERIOR MAN ASPIRES TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS

SUPERIORS. THE INFERIOR MAN ASPIRES TO ASSOCIATE WITH

HIS INFERIOR.

                                       Chapter 14

 

EXCESSIVE WORRY IS A SIGN OF A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

GUILT SKEWS ONE’S PERCEPTION OF REALITY.

SETTING ASIDE PHYSICAL INJURY AND INCARCERATION,

PROBLEMS ARE EXTREMELY EPHEMERAL.

THE ONLY IRREVERSIBLE PROBLEMS ARE THOSE INVOLVING

INCARCERATION OR PHYSICAL INJURY.

WHEN ONE THINKS IN TERMS OF GETTING RID OF A GIVEN

PROBLEM IN ONE STROKE, THAT PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO SEEM

HUGE. WHEN ONE THINKS IN TERMS OF EATING AWAY AT IT,

BIT BY BIT, IT STARTS TO SEEM SMALL. THE WAY TO GET RID

OF PROBLEMS IS INCREMENTALLY.

THEORY IS ABOUT GIANT LEAPS. PRACTICE IS ABOUT STEADY

PROGRESS.

I ONLY GET WRITER’S BLOCK WHEN I DON’T BELIEVE WHAT I

AM SAYING.

INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL PARALYSIS RESULT FROM

DISHONESTY WITH ONESELF.

ONE MUST RUTHLESSLY HOLD ONESELF TO STANDARDS, BUT

THE STANDARDS TO WHICH ONE HOLDS ONESELF MUST ARISE

ORGANICALLY OUT OF ONE’S OWN BEING. IF ONE EVALUATES

ONESELF IN TERMS OF A YARDSTICK THAT IS ALIEN TO WHO

ONE IS, ONE’S LIFE WILL BE A LIE AND ONE WILL NOT GROW.

IF YOU ARE GROWING, THEN YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU

SHOULD BE DOING. IF YOU ARE NOT GROWING, YOU ARE NOT

DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

THE NEUROTIC CANNOT UNDERSTAND THINGS ON THEIR OWN

TERMS. THE NON-NEUROTIC CAN.

IF YOU RUSH, YOU WILL NEVER GET TO WHERE YOU ARE

TRYING TO GO. WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, YOU MUST DO IT

STEADILY AND DELIBERATELY.

SLOW DOES NOT MEAN STEADY, AND FAST DOES NOT MEANRUSHED. BUT WHEN ONE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT ONE IS DOING,

SLOWNESS CONDUCES TO STEADINESS, AND RAPIDITY

CONDUCES TO ITS ABSENCE WHEN ONE DOESN’T.

‘DECEIT DOES MORE HARM’, A WISE MAN ONCE SAID, ‘TO THE

DECEIVER THAN TO THE DECEIVED.’ THIS IS BECAUSE, IN

DECEIVING ANOTHER, ONE IS MERELY INCONVENIENCING

THAT PERSON, BUT ONE IS TURNING ONESELF INTO A FRAUD

AND CONSEQUENTLY INTO AN EMPTY HUSK OF A PERSON.

ONLY LITTLE PEOPLE STRUT.

FALSE ACCUSATIONS ARE TRUE CONFESSIONS.

  PROCRASTINATION IS A SIGN OF A BROKEN WILL AND A

  DISINTEGRATING PSYCHE.

IF YOU ARE ON A MISSION, OBSTACLES ARE MERE BUMPS INTO

THE ROAD. IF YOU ARE NOT, MERE BUMPS IN THE ROAD ARE

INSUPERABLE OBSTACLES.

A FEW MINUTES AGO, I HAD A PROBLEM THAT I DIDN’T KNOW

HOW TO RESOLVE. SO I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS LITTLE BOOK,

SINCE I WANTED TO MAKE PROGRESS OF SOME KIND, EVEN IF

IT WASN’T RELEVANT TO THE PROBLEM IN QUESTION. THEN,

JUST AS I WAS FINISHING UP THIS LITTLE BOOK, IT TURNS OUT

THAT PROBLEM SOLVED ITSELF. IN GENERAL, IF ONE

IDENTIFIES, AND THEN IMMERSES ONESELF IN, SOME COURSE

OF ACTION THAT IS TRUE TO WHO ONE IS, ONE FINDS THAT

ONE’S PROBLEMS EITHER SOLVE THEMSELVES OR AT THE

VERY LEAST BECOME TRACTABLE. THE ONE THING A PERSON

CAN ALWAYS DO IS BE TRUE TO HIMSELF, AND IF HE DOES

THAT, HE FINDS THAT HE IS ABLE TO DO A NUMBER OF OTHER

THINGS THAT HE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT BEYOND HIM.

IF YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN, YOU WILL USUALLY FIND THAT

YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOU HAD TO.

COMPULSIVE WORK---IN OTHER WORDS, WORK THAT IS NOT

FREELY, BEING DONE UNDER INTERNAL DURESS---IS

PASSIVITY POSING AS ACTIVITY, AND IT IS THEREFORE SLOTH

POSING AS INDUSTRY.

ULTIMATELY, THERE IS BUT ONE COMMANDMENT, TO BE

ACTIVE, AS OPPOSED TO PASSIVE; TO LIVE, AND NOT TO DIE.

THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS ARE: PRIDE, GREED, LUST, ENVY,

GLUTTONY, WRATH, AND SLOTH.

PRIDE NARROWS ONE FIELD OF VISION AND CLOSES ONE

MIND. WHEN ONE’S MIND IS CLOSED, ONE STOPS GROWING

AND THEREFORE STARTS DYING.

GREED IS ABOUT LOSS OF CONTROL AND, THEREFORE, LOSS

OF AGENCY. IT IS ABOUT USING ONE’S AGENCY TO MINISTER

TO THAT WITHIN ONESELF THAT IS CARNAL AND THEREFORE

SUB- AGENTIAL.

LUST IS ABOUT THE SPIRIT SURRENDERING TO THE FLESH

AND, CONSEQUENLTY, ABOUT THAT WHICH IS ACTIVE, AND

THEREFORE GENUINELY LIVING, SURRENDERING TO THAT

WHICH IS PASSIVE, AND THEREFORE NOT REALLY LIVING.

ENVY IS ABOUT TEARING DOWN OTHERS, INSTEAD OF

IMPROVING ONESELF. THEREFORE, IT IS ABOUT GIVING UP

AND NO LONGER IMPROVING ONESELF. THEREFORE, IT IS

ABOUT CEASING TO GROW AND BEGINNING TO DIE.

GLUTTONY IS ABOUT FORFEITURE OF AGENCY. IT IS ABOUT

THAT WHICH IS PASSIVE WITHIN ONE TRIUMPHING OVER

THAT WHICH IS ACTIVE.

WRATH IS ABOUT LOSS OF CENTER. THEREFORE, IT IS ABOUT

LOSS OF CONTROL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ABOUT LOSS OF

AGENCY.

SLOTH IS AN OUTRIGHT GENERALIZED FORFEITURE OF

AGENCY AND IS THEREFORE DEATH IN LIFE.

CONCLUSION: TO LIVE IS TO BE ACTIVE, TO DIE IS TO BEPASSIVE, AND TO SIN IS BE A LIVING BEING THAT IS NO

LONGER TRYING TO LIVE.

A USEFUL METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE IS THAT, IF WE ARE

TRYING TO EXPLAIN X IN TERMS OF Y AND WE CANNOT DO

SO, THEN WE SHOULD TRY TO EXPLAIN Y IN TERMS OF X. IN

OTHER WORDS, WE SHOULD TREAT THE EXPLANANDUM AS

THE EXPLANANS AND VICE VERSA. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO

EXPLAIN LIVING BEINGS IN TERMS OF NON-LIVING BEINGS,

BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN NON-LIVING BEINGS IN TERMS

OF LIVING ONES. NON-LIVING BEINGS ARE, AT LEAST IN SOME

CASES, THE DETRITUS OR WASTE-PRODUCTS OF LIVING

BEINGS. SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD REGARD THE UNIVERSE AS

FUNDAMENTALLY LIVING, AND WE SHOULD SEE THE NON-

LIVING PART OF AS A DETRITUS GENERATED BY ITS LIVING

CORE.

BE GENEROUS WITH YOURSELF AND WITH OTHERS.

PROFIT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND GIVE AS MUCH AS

POSSIBLE.

GENEROSITY WITH ONESELF IS NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT

FOR GENEROSITY WITH OTHERS.

THE SORROWS OF A LARGE SOUL ARE NOBLER THAN THE JOYS

OF A SMALL ONE.

WHAT WE CALL ‘FAITH’ IS KNOWLEDGE OF DEEP TRUTHS,

AND WHAT WE CALL ‘KNOWLEDGE’ IS KNOLWLEDGE OF

SHALLOW TRUTHS.

EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT IS

VALID. LIFE IS THE CONQUEST OF PURPOSE OVER CHANCE

AND THEREFORE CANNOT ITSELF BE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF

CHANCE.

‘I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW THE CLOCKWORK OF THE UNIVERSE

CAN EXIST WITHOUT A CLOCKMAKER,’ SAID VOLTAIRE.

VOLTAIRE WAS EVEN MORE RIGHT THAN HE KNEW. FOR

WHEREAS THE PARTS OF A CLOCK ARE NOT THEMSELVES

CLOCKS, THE PARTS OF AN ORGANISM ARE THEMSELVES

ORGANISMS. THEREFORE, THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY LIFE

FORMS WHEREVER THERE IS ONE, AND THE PROBABILITY OF

AN ORGANISM’S EXISTING INDEPENDENTLY OF A DIVINE

CREATOR IS THEREFORE INFINITELY SMALLER THAN THE

PROBABILITY OF A CLOCK’S EXISTING INDEPENDENTLY OF A

  CLOCK-MAKER.

THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS PURE, EVEN THOUGH THE THINGS THE

TRUTH CONCERNS ARE OFTEN IMPURE, AND KNOWLEDGE IS

ALWAYS DIVINE EVEN THOUGH ITS OBJECTS ARE OFTEN

ANYTHING BUT.

GOD IS RATIONALITY EXTERNALIZED, AND RATIONALITY IS

GOD INTERNALIZED.

AGENCY IS RATIONALITY AND RATIONALITY IS KNOWLEDGEOF GOD.

ALL KNOWLEDGE IS KNOWLEDGE OF GOD.

GOD WANTS US TO SHARE IN HIS STRENGTH, AND ONE SHARES

IN GOD’S STRENGTH BY DEVELOPING ONE’S MIND.

MORALITY IS INTELLECT APPLIED TO PRACTICAL PROBLEMS.

THOSE WHO BELIEVE ARE THERE FOR EACH OTHER AND FOR

THAT VERY REASON CAN STAND ON THEIR OWN.

IT TAKES MORE STRENGTH TO BEAR GOOD FORTUNE THAN

BAD.

WHEN TIMES ARE HARD, WE DEFINE OURSELVES IN TERMS

OF EXTERNAL HARDSHIPS. WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD, WE

DEFINE OURSELVES IN TERMS OF OURSELVES. THEREFORE, IT

IS WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD THAT ONE DISCOVERS ONE’S

TRUE CHARACTER---OR LACK THEREOF.

GET. SAVE. GIVE.

LIVE EVERY DAY AS THOUGH IT WERE YOUR LAST.

GOD IS MERCIFUL. BUT YOUR CONSCIENCE IS NOT. MAKE

SURE YOU STAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF IT.

THOSE WHO TRY TO LIVE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THEIR

CONSCIENCE DO NOT LIVE AT ALL. IT WASN’T WHEN HE

HANGED HIMSELF THAT JUDAS COMMITED SUICIDE. IT WAS

WHEN BE BETRAYED CHRIST.

MANY A MAN HAS TRIED TO OVERTHROW HIS SUPEREGO. THIS

NEVER WORKS. THE RESULT IS ALWAYS A WEAKENED EGO

AND THEREFORE A DIMINISHED CAPACITY FOR PLEASURE

AND FULFILLMENT.

THERE ARE NO PLEASURES WORTH ENTIRELY SPURNING. BUT

SOME PLEASURES REQUIRE MORE CONTEXTUALIZING THAN

OTHERS.

EVERY EXPERIENCE INTRODUCES YOU TO A HIDDEN FACET OF

YOUR OWN PSYCHE. DO NOT FLEE FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES.

REVEL IN THEM. IN THAT WAY, YOU WILL MASTER YOUR

DARKER EXPERIENCES, AND THEY WILL THEREFORE NOT

MASTER YOU.

ULTIMATELY ALL FRAUDS ARE PERPETRATED AGAINST

ONESELF, AND THAT IS WHY FRAUD NEVER WORKS.

LEARN FROM OTHER AUTHORS. ASSIMILATE THEIR TEACHINGS.

BUT NEVER PLAGIARIZE FROM THEM. IF YOU PLAGIARIZE

FROM THEM, IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GENUINELY

ASSIMILATING THEIR TEACHINGS. ONE COPIES WHAT ONE HAS

NOT ABSORBED.

WHATEVER YOU DO, IT MUST PROCEED FROM THE VERY CORE

OF YOUR BEING. THIS IS THE ONLY MORAL LAW, AND IF YOU

ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF IT, YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE

OF EVERY OTHER MORAL LAW.

WHEN  YOU  ARE  FAULTERING,  WHEN  YOUR  BOAT  IS

ROCKING,  REMEMBER  THAT  GOD  IS  ON  YOUR  SIDE  ANDTHAT  YOU HAVE  THE  POWER  OF  AN  INFINITELY

INTELLIGENT AND BENIFICENT BEING BEHIND YOU.

WORK  STEADILY,  BUT  NOT  STRENUOUSLY.  YOU  WILL  BE

MORE PRODUCTIVE THAT WAY.

OFTENTIMES, WE SIMPLY DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IF THERE

IS A TIME-TESTED MORAL CODE THAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED,

THEN WE CAN FOLLOW IT DURING SUCH TIMES OF

UNCERTAINTY. IF WE HAVE SPURNED ALL SUCH CODES,

UNCERTAIN TIMES EITHER DESTROY US OR THEY MAKE US

ACCEPT JUST SUCH CODES.

OFTENTIMES ADOLESCENT REFUSAL TO ACCEPT A MORAL

CODE IS MERELY THE PRECURSOR OF ACCEPTANCE OF IT. IT IS

BEST NOT TO FORCE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT DOCTRINES THAT

THEY CLAIM TO REFUSE, AS THEIR APPARENT REFUSAL TO

ACCEPT THEM IS REALLY THEIR WAY OF ACCEPTING THEM.

ANXIETY IS UNPLEASANT, BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE

EXPERIENCING IT, YOU ARE STILL CAPABLE OF EMOTIONAL

CONFLICT AND YOU ARE THEREFORE STILL VERY MUCH

ALIVE.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO ASK GOD FOR GUIDANCE. WHEN YOU DO

SO, HE WILL OBLIGE.

BY VIRTUE OF BEING A HUMAN BEING, YOU ARE ABLE TO HEED

GOD’S WISDOM AND YOU ARE THEREFORE ABLE TO PARTAKE

IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM.

LEARN HOW TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE. THE ABILITY TO HEED

YOUR OWN WISDOM IS AS VALUABLE AS THAT WISDOM

ITSELF.
