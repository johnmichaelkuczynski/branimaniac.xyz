PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• One must necessarily be a Platonist. There is no way to replace references to numbers, mathematical operations, or other mathematical structures with references to spatiotemporal entities.

• There are no observable instances of infinite quantities. One can see two hands, three apples, and so on, but not infinitely many.

• The idea that infinite quantities and arithmetical operations can be 'abstracted' from observable phenomena is irrelevant, since it speaks only to our knowledge of those operations, not to their existence—it doesn't eliminate the need for a Platonic metaphysics.

• The resistance people have to Platonism is misconceived and derives from assuming that Platonic entities, if they exist, are giant copies in the sky of their Earthly instances.

• Any given body of truths is necessarily internally consistent. Therefore mathematics, setting aside the odd screw-up, is consistent.

• Physical simplicity doesn't equate to conceptual simplicity.

• George Cantor proved in the 1870s that there is no recursive definition of the class of real numbers, using diagonalization.

• Fifty years later, Gödel tried to come up with a recursive definition of the class of arithmetical truths. He couldn't and then decided to prove that no such definition was possible. He succeeded. His proof involved an exotic form of diagonalization.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
LOGIC AND REASONING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Mathematical logic is a bit sterile.

• Logic, as it is taught in philosophy and even in math departments, is a heap of artifacts.

• Deductive reasoning yields insight but not knowledge.

• Abductive reasoning is simply hypothesis-formation.

• Modus ponens is basically to the effect that you can infer it if it follows. It is not possible to invalidate modus ponens.

• Whether a given statement is to be regarded as complex, and how exactly it is to be regarded as complex, depends on the dialectical context.

• Nothing contradicts facts and logic—contradictions between facts and logic means that the wrong logic is being used.

• Any consistent set of sentences can be extended to a maximal consistent set.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ZENO'S PARADOX AND MOTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Zeno has established that if any given motion presupposes another motion, then nothing can even begin to leave the place that it is occupying at a given time.

• Zeno is asking how a given object can take that first step.

• The sum of infinitely many positive numbers may be finite (e.g. 1+½+¼+⅛ = 2), and any finite number can be represented as such a sum.

• All position is relative position. Therefore, changes in position are changes in relative position.

• The more objects there are in a given universe, the greater the number of distances with which a given distance can be compared.

• For any possible universe U, there is some distance D such that nothing in U can move at all without covering a distance of at least D.

• Seemingly system-internal changes are systemic changes.

• Systemic changes are too complex for us to understand with any precision.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ECONOMICS AND EDUCATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The formal study of economics at any level is the very definition of a waste of time.

• Macroeconomics is social psychology, in so far as the latter relates to commercial behavior.

• The classical economists (Smith, Marshall) were enormously illuminating. But at some point, something horrible happened to the discipline; they tried to model it on physics or some such, and it lost all contact with anything real.

• If you want predictions, ask the guy who landscapes your garden or fixes your car. Don't ask an economist, at least not an economics professor.

• College is a sham, and within a few years, judicious use of already existing digital resources will see to it that it is a distant memory.

• High IQ university graduates strongly tend to out-earn IQ-comparable non-graduates.

• School doesn't give us the tools we need in adulthood. It doesn't give us the requisite technical skills, nor the requisite understanding of the economy or of its psychological underpinnings, nor does it encourage the development of character traits needed to not be a victim.

• The purpose of a dissertation is to show that the dissertation-writer can engage existing work in an authoritative and at least relatively original way.

• An MBA is useful if your objective is to be a corporate bureaucrat who earns five to six figures. Not if your objective is to be an entrepreneur.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ACADEMIA AND JOURNALS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Academic journals are no longer read because they're boring, and they're boring because they're bad. Academia, with some minor qualifications, is not where the action is now.

• Academic books and journals look nice—the covers and typography and layout all look nice. But there's not very much there.

• 100 years ago, academic journals served a function. Crelle's Journal, the Monatshefte in which Einstein and Gödel published their results—yes, these were nice sources of information.

• Go ahead and read some recent "work" on the mind-body problem, or (God forbid) on "ethics," and you will truly understand the concept of nothingness.

• The first job to be automated happened a long time ago. The next big one—teachers. Most of that is best automated.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHILOSOPHY GENERALLY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• The most dangerous question in philosophy is whether there can be political solutions to biologically or culturally rooted problems.

• Strictly semantic questions categorically fall outside the scope of philosophy, the asseverations of a few early 20th century lightweights to the contrary.

• Right now the most urgent and therefore interesting philosophical problem is how information can be encrypted so as to expedite the transmission of it and maximize the absorption of it.

• Commerce is now quite as much about the exchange of information as it is about the exchange of physical goods and services.

• There are two classes of disputes: (i) Those that are emotional in nature, though they are presented as being about objective moral verities. And (ii) Those that are rooted in fundamentally different cognitive architectures.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXISTENTIALISM AND MORALITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Sartre's message is: 'You are free; deal with it; make the most of it. Life is a roller-coaster; don't water down the experience with false attachments.'

• Camus held that, since the morality of his parents was now losing its hold, morality was categorically an illusion, and he believed this to entail that life categorically has no meaning.

• Nietzsche obviously did believe that a lot of the moral codes people accept are basically so much soul-destroying propaganda; and he also believed that, during his lifetime, their lack of legitimacy was quickly becoming apparent.

• Socrates was trying to improve the world by making it less emotional and more logical, whereas Jesus was trying to improve it by making it more emotional and less legalistic.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PSYCHOLOGY AND HUMAN NATURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• It is very hard to keep someone down if he has talent and character. And it is very hard to prop someone up if he has neither.

• People can change a great deal, for better or worse, but some aspects of a person's psyche cannot be contravened without damaging that person.

• A lot of people rationalize selling out by telling themselves that they are being flexible and 'fluid', but they are actually being weak and rigid, since a genuinely adaptive person finds a way to survive without gutting his personality in the process.

• You cannot change your sexuality. What you can do is accept it and, on that basis, alter how you channel it.

• A psychopath-free society would be a society of eunuchs.

• Intrusive thoughts about religious figures occur because you want to be free and somebody is using religious tyranny to constrain you. Accept that, and the intrusive thoughts will vanish.

• All people understand mathematics. What we refer to as 'mathematical talent' is about being able to operationalize mathematical intelligence outside of those contexts in which it is automatically operational.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTIVITY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Bonuses enormously improve productivity. Once people get used to upfront pay and no longer feel the stick of urgency, they need the carrot of bonuses to keep on plugging away, especially if the work involves creativity or insight.

• Low level workers are more interested in how little they can do and get by than they are in moving forward. But with talent—gotta reward it.

• The line between good clients and dirty clients is utterly sharp. Good clients pay and are honest about what you have done for them. Dirty clients lie about what you've done—and they show their true colors pretty much right away.

• If you have a legitimate business idea, then you have more answers than just about anyone you come across, and you should go for it.

• If you ask other people if your idea is good, they are likely to say 'no' if it is good and 'yes' if it is bad, because they are stuck at miserable jobs and want you to be stuck with them.

• Social media facilitates the flow of information, and social media influencers can help people benefit from that increased flow.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
IDENTITY AND METAPHYSICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Identity is about continuity. A given flower today does not consist of the same particles that it consisted of two days ago. Your body—same story. (Ship of Theseus solution)

• No matter how well populated and otherwise heterogeneous the universe is, the universe is capable of being even more populous and otherwise heterogeneous.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TESTING AND ASSESSMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Standardized tests are extraordinarily efficient and are indicated in contexts where only very approximate knowledge is necessary or where knowledge about whole populations is necessary.

• With individuals, standardized tests are of limited use, since people can dramatically over- or under-perform depending on a variety of contextual factors.

• As a way of testing for basic knowledge or basic cognitive fitness, standardized tests are much less subjective and resource-intensive than ad hoc methods currently used in most educational and diagnostic contexts.
