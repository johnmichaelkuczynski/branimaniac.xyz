KUCZYNSKI: ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY CHAPTER 4 - POSITION STATEMENTS

=== MEANING AND LANGUAGE FUNDAMENTALS ===

1. The concept of language is fundamentally tied to the concept of meaning.
2. Understanding the nature of language requires distinguishing between different types of meaning.
3. Linguistic expressions are inherently meaningful.
4. Nothing meaningless is an expression.
5. There would be no languages if there were no expressions.
6. The word 'meaning' has three distinct meanings: evidential, psychological, and linguistic.
7. Only one meaning of 'meaning' directly relates to the nature of language.
8. Linguistic meaning is distinct and foundational.
9. What might seem meaningless can be interpreted as either false or vacuously true.
10. Chomsky's "colorless green dreams sleep furiously" is not genuinely meaningless.

=== EVIDENTIAL MEANING ===

11. Evidential meaning involves causal relations between phenomena.
12. To say x 'means' y evidentially is to say x is evidence of y.
13. Smoke meaning fire is an example of evidential meaning.
14. Evidential meaning involves reasonable inference from cause to effect.
15. Evidential meaning is not the primary sense relevant to language.

=== PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANING ===

16. Psychological meaning is what speakers intend to convey.
17. Meaning in the psychological sense is tied to intentions.
18. When we use sentences, we mean things by them in the psychological sense.
19. Psychological meaning involves speaker intentions.
20. Psychological meaning presupposes linguistic meaning.
21. My meaning something is parasitic on my utterance's meaning.
22. Speakers' intentions rely on pre-existing meanings of sentences.
23. Psychological meaning involves but does not coincide with linguistic meaning.
24. Meaning in the psychological sense differs from linguistic meaning.
25. Speaker meaning is dependent on conventional meaning.

=== LINGUISTIC MEANING ===

26. The sentence 'snow is white' means that snow is white linguistically.
27. Linguistic meaning involves attributing properties to objects.
28. Sentences say something about something.
29. Linguistic meaning is a matter of convention.
30. Linguistic meaning differs from natural signs like smoke and fire.
31. The meaning of "snow is white" is determined by linguistic conventions.
32. Linguistic meaning is not determined by direct causal relationships.
33. Sentences can have determinate meanings independent of being uttered.
34. The cube root example shows meaning exists without prior utterance.
35. Linguistic meaning exists even for never-before-uttered sentences.

=== SEMANTIC RULES ===

36. Languages are sets of semantic rules.
37. Semantic rules systematically pair sentences with meanings.
38. Semantic rules assign meanings to properties of physical objects.
39. Semantic rules do not assign meanings to expressions directly.
40. Expression-types are properties, not particulars.
41. Expression-tokens are instances of properties.
42. Types and tokens serve different semantic functions.
43. Semantic rules assign meanings to properties rather than to expressions themselves.
44. The function-theoretic view of semantic rules is problematic.
45. Semantic rules exist independently of the expressions they assign meanings to.

=== TYPES AND TOKENS ===

46. Expression-types are properties that can be instantiated.
47. Expression-tokens are particular instances of expression-types.
48. Types are properties; tokens are particulars.
49. Tokens bear truth values; types do not.
50. No sentence-type containing a context-sensitive component is true or false.
51. It is tokens that make statements; types do not.
52. Expression-types cannot refer to specific objects.
53. Types and tokens have profoundly different metaphysical natures.
54. A two-dimensional approach to semantics is necessary.
55. The same type can have tokens with different meanings in different contexts.

=== CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY ===

56. Context-sensitive expressions are central to language.
57. Indexicals are expressions whose reference depends on context.
58. Demonstratives are indexicals requiring demonstration.
59. "I," "now," "here," and "today" are indexicals.
60. Indexicals have a two-dimensional semantic structure.
61. The meaning of a token is the referent it picks out.
62. The meaning of a type is the rule assigning referents to tokens.
63. What a token of 'I am tired now' affirms depends on context.
64. Semantic rules assign propositions based on context of utterance.
65. Context-sensitive sentences are not ambiguous despite varying meanings.

=== DEFINITE DESCRIPTIONS ===

66. Definite descriptions also have a two-dimensional semantic structure.
67. Definite descriptions are context-sensitive.
68. Some definite descriptions appear to be 'incomplete.'
69. Incomplete definite descriptions fail to pick out a single object.
70. Context enriches the mediating concept to enable reference.
71. Definite descriptions pick out objects via mediating concepts.
72. The enrichment of definite descriptions is context-dependent.

=== INDEXICALS AND PERSPECTIVAL INFORMATION ===

73. Indexical-free languages are expressively impoverished.
74. Much information is perspectival.
75. Nothing perspectival can be stated without indexicals.
76. Indexicals are necessary for expressing perspectival thoughts.
77. Believing it's 60° in Richmond on Feb. 07 differs from thinking it's now 60°.
78. The same literal content can be grasped differently from different perspectives.
79. Perspectival information embodies the speaker's viewpoint.
80. Context-sensitivity is essential for capturing nuanced beliefs.

=== DEGREE PROPERTIES ===

81. Degree properties like "smart" are contextually relative.
82. The same word can have different meanings in different contexts.
83. Words like "smart" are not ambiguous in the ordinary sense.
84. Degree properties are implicitly relational.
85. Degree properties are understood relative to contextually determined benchmarks.
86. Fido being "smart" for a dog differs from Timmy being "smart" for a child.
87. The benchmark for degree properties is context-dependent.
88. Contextual relativity differs from ambiguity.

=== PRE-SEMANTIC VS SEMANTIC ===

89. The literal meaning of utterances can be obscured by pre-semantic information.
90. Professional semanticists uncover true literal meanings.
91. The same literal meaning can be affirmed without the speaker realizing it.
92. Different perceptual descriptions can lead to different grasps of the same meaning.
93. Pre-semantic factors influence how meaning is processed.
94. Semantic meaning is distinct from perceptual or pragmatic enrichment.
95. Uncovering literal meanings requires distinguishing semantic from pre-semantic factors.

=== LOGICAL FORM VS GRAMMATICAL FORM ===

96. A statement's grammatical form may diverge from its logical form.
97. Logical form reveals the true underlying structure.
98. Grammatical form is the surface structure of sentences.
99. "Whales are mammals" has a logical form different from its grammatical form.
100. Quantified sentences are pseudo-objectual statements.
101. Quantified sentences appear to be about objects but are about properties.
102. "Someone snores" is really about the property of snoring being instantiated.
103. Frege's insight that grammatical and logical form diverge revolutionized logic.
104. Understanding logical form is essential for understanding meaning.

=== DEFINITIONS ===

105. Contextual definitions explain how expressions affect sentence meaning.
106. Denotative definitions specify what expressions denote.
107. All definitions are ultimately contextual.
108. To define an expression is to show how it affects sentence meaning.
109. Reference to an object affects a sentence's truth-conditions.
110. Definitions relate expressions to their semantic contributions.

=== PROPER NAMES ===

111. Proper names have semantic rules that differ from indexicals.
112. Proper names differ semantically from definite descriptions.
113. The semantic rule for "Bill Clinton" is different from rules for indexicals.
114. Proper names refer to objects across contexts.
115. The reference of a proper name is not context-relative in the way indexicals are.

=== FREGE'S CONTRIBUTION ===

116. Frege generalized the concept of a mathematical function.
117. Frege's function concept enabled the revolution in logic.
118. The function concept revealed divergence between grammatical and logical form.
119. Frege distinguished between sense and reference.
120. Frege's work is foundational to modern semantics.
121. Understanding functions is essential to understanding logical form.

=== EXPRESSIONS AND ANIMATE BEINGS ===

122. Expressions require animate beings to exist.
123. In a world without animate beings, there would be no expressions.
124. Semantic rules involve the activity of animate beings.
125. Language use involves judgments about the world.
126. Utterances involve normative dimensions.
127. Language is fundamentally social and conventional.

=== MEANINGLESS EXPRESSIONS ===

128. The notion of meaningless expressions is problematic.
129. What are called meaningless are often non-expressions.
130. Absurd but meaningful sentences differ from meaningless strings.
131. Homonyms used in unconventional contexts may seem meaningless.
132. All genuine expressions have some form of meaning.
133. The appearance of meaninglessness often reflects confusion.

=== ANALYTIC TRADITION ===

134. Analytic philosophy emphasizes clarity and precision.
135. Rigorous analysis of meaning is central to analytic philosophy.
136. Logical argumentation supports philosophical claims.
137. Conceptual analysis distinguishes related concepts.
138. The philosophy of language is a core analytic discipline.
139. Precise definitions advance philosophical understanding.
140. Distinguishing types of meaning is methodologically essential.
