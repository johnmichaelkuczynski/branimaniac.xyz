POSITION STATEMENTS: KUCZYNSKI - FREE WILL AND OTHER COLLECTED PAPERS

================================================================================

ORIGINALISM (CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION)

1. The expression "the intentions of the framers" denotes an idealization, not an empirical actuality, since the various framers had numerically and qualitatively different minds.

2. When the word "they" is part of an expression meant to denote a collective attitude, it denotes an idealization rather than an empirical reality.

3. Originalism is exceedingly dubious if the term "intentions" is understood in purely individualistic, psychological terms.

4. If originalism is to hold water, "the intentions of the framers" must refer to the intentions of some kind of collective entity.

5. The intentions of the framers cannot be understood strictly in terms of the psychologies of the framers taken individually.

6. The originalist position collapses into circularity: Constitutional interpretations are to be evaluated in terms of the intentions of the framers, but the intentions of the framers are to be understood in terms of the historical and social role of Constitutional interpretation.

7. An idealization is by definition something that has no precise counterpart in the spatiotemporal world.

8. When discussing what Jefferson would have said about constitutional issues, we are not making an empirical statement about what the actual Jefferson would have said, but rather an a priori proposition about what he should have said given his values.

9. The originalist is caught in a vicious circle: he must use a counterfactual to identify the values on which his conception of Constitutionality is based, but he cannot run the counterfactual until he has identified those values.

10. Jefferson's values are definable independently of any views of Constitutional interpretation, but the expression "Jefferson's values" itself denotes an idealization as opposed to a psychological reality.

11. Like many complex human beings, Jefferson had many values, and while some may have been fair-minded and egalitarian, others may have been retrograde and misogynist.

12. When we say that Jefferson was not being "true to his values," the word "his" doesn't denote Thomas Jefferson the human being but rather an idealization of Jefferson purged of his 18th century prejudices.

13. Even the finest minds are marred by ugly biases.

14. When we talk about what Jefferson would have said, we are talking about what some idealization of Jefferson would have said—one who didn't suffer from the cultural limitations and random neuroses that mar even the best of minds.

15. Once we start dealing with an idealization of Jefferson's psyche, as opposed to his actual psyche, we have replaced empirical propositions about psychology with a priori propositions about values.

================================================================================

BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER

16. People with borderline personality disorder have two distinct, simultaneously operative psychological "operating systems"—one appropriately adult and sane, the other infantile in nature.

17. One part of the BPD person's mind remained "stuck" or "fixated" at an early phase of life, usually very early childhood, while the other part advanced to maturity.

18. The fixation in BPD typically results from a trauma, usually sexual molestation.

19. People with BPD oscillate between their adult and infantile psychological integrations.

20. The rapid oscillation between two modalities makes BPD individuals appear to be lying or "playing games," when in fact they are shifting between two distinct and incongruent worldviews.

21. People with BPD are not psychopaths, despite sometimes acting in entitled, limitlessly self-serving narcissistic ways.

22. The difference between BPD and psychopathy: the psychopath is simply a phony who sometimes puts on a mask of sanity and decency, while the BPD person is genuinely two-sided, with neither side being a mask.

23. The preferred psychological defense mechanism in BPD is splitting rather than repression.

24. The BPD personality-structure is itself the result of splitting.

25. Repression involves having a single psychological architecture and shoving incompatible conceits into the unconscious, while splitting involves shifting between one's adult side and one's infantile side.

26. The normal person's psyche keeps its infantilism in the abyss of the unconscious, while the BPD person's psyche keeps infantilisms in a concurrently operative sphere of mental activity.

27. The essence of borderline personality disorder is that splitting takes the place of repression.

28. When the psychopath acts non-psychopathically, it is because he is just acting; when the BPD person acts non-psychopathically, it is because she is being true to one side of her personality.

29. When the BPD person acts psychopathically, it is because she is regressing and her infantile side is dominating, not because a mask has fallen.

================================================================================

GROUP PSYCHOLOGY

30. Most people, including most psychologists, wrongly assume that group psychology is to be understood in terms of individual psychology.

31. The standard view that individuals have self-directed drives that are somehow diverted in group contexts cannot be reconciled with the incredibly high degree of conformism exhibited by people.

32. The deference given by people to convention, pre-existing custom, and fleeting but powerful fads cannot be explained in terms of fear of others alone.

33. Given how unintelligent, ignorant, and lacking in moral fiber most individuals are, yet how much intelligence, knowledge, and moral rigor is embodied in the behavior of collectives, it is hard to believe that collectives are merely the result of individuals pursuing their respective paths.

34. The collective is the primary thing, biologically speaking, and there is an illusion of individual choice and indeed of individualism per se.

35. Individual cells can be better understood if we recognize that they individually try to survive, flourish, and reproduce only to the extent that their doing so is necessary for the collectives formed thereby to survive, flourish, and reproduce.

36. Cell-individualism can be explained in terms of cell collectivism, but not so much vice versa.

37. Person-individualism can be explained in terms of person-collectivism, but not so much vice versa.

38. Bona fide individuals—geniuses who think for themselves—can be seen as limiting cases of collectives, as collectives of one, or as rogue actors with an unusual office within a collective.

39. The intense drives that individuals have to survive and experience gratification can be seen as necessary for, and therefore explainable in terms of, the collectives to which they belong.

40. It is very hard to explain group behavior on the assumption that collectives represent averages of the behaviors of so many self-contained existentialist autonomous deciders.

41. Outside of contexts involving immediate threats to physical well-being or prospects of crude gratification, people give far too much weight to existing beliefs and mores to be accounted for by the hypothesis that collectives are indeed collectives of bona fide individuals.

================================================================================

FINANCIAL REGULATION

42. Before the 1929 Stock Market Crash, the nation's financial system was highly unregulated, leading to improprieties that caused the Crash.

43. The Fed responded to the Stock Market Crash by tightening monetary policy, which exacerbated the situation and led to a full-blown economic depression.

44. Glass-Steagall prohibited commercial banks from functioning as investment banks, thereby preventing banks from using customer funds to finance their own ventures.

45. The repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 and the deregulation of the derivatives market in 2004 eliminated the firewalls put in place after the 1929 Crash.

46. The 2001 Dot Bomb Crash resulted from banks investing in substandard tech startups, and the 2008 Housing Crash resulted from banks investing in worthless derivatives contracts.

47. A derivative is a contract whose value is a function of the value of some other security, and most derivatives are highly leveraged, highly risky, and difficult to value.

48. The price of a home tends to stay close to its value, but with securities there is very little short-term relationship between price and value—the two can diverge without limit instantaneously.

49. When real-estate debts were bundled into financial securities like MBS's, the market could make them far more valuable than the underlying assets, and could do so in hours.

50. Once mortgages were securitized, investment banks had enormous incentives to drive up the number of home loans issued, regardless of the quality of those loans.

51. Bubbles can only last so long; eventually prices and values converge when demand fails to keep pace with supply.

52. The 2008 crisis was really two distinct crises: a housing crisis that decreased wealth and a banking crisis that diminished credit.

53. Economies depend on credit as much as they do on wealth; when businesses cannot borrow, they fail and the economy fails.

54. The Volcker Rule does not categorically prohibit banks from engaging in proprietary trading but requires that they match customer funds with their own funds when doing so.

55. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from partnering with hedge funds and private equity firms to limit the extent to which large banks can endanger themselves and the market.

56. The Fed's role as a regulatory agency is ambiguous, since unlike every other financial regulatory agency, it is partly made up of the very entities it is supposed to regulate.

57. Given that three banks own over 75% of the Fed's shares, the Fed has at best a serious conflict of interest and at worst has no existence separate from the banks that own it.

58. Financial regulation has done a great deal of good and very little harm; financial deregulation has done a great deal of harm and very little good.

59. The Fed is in the practice of managing self-generated crises.

60. We cannot expect banks to self-regulate, and we therefore cannot expect the Fed to self-regulate to the extent that it is owned by banks.

61. In the United States, financial regulations have decentralized access to capital, keeping the economy going, while financial deregulation has hindered the economy by centralizing access to capital.

62. Even by the lights of a radical free marketeer, financial regulation has been a success because it has decentralized access to capital.

================================================================================

SORITES PARADOX

63. The Sorites paradox can be solved while holding on to all the laws of classical logic, contrary to most attempts that reject the law of bivalence.

64. Given any predicate that generates a Sorites-paradox, significant use of that predicate is actually elliptical for a relational statement.

65. A significant token of "Bob is poor" means "Bob is poor compared to x" for some value of x.

66. Once a value of x is supplied, a definite cutoff line between having and not having the paradox-generating predicate is supplied, which neutralizes the inductive step.

67. Not all properties generate Sorites-type arguments; only properties that can be had to varying degrees generate them.

68. Binary properties—those that do not admit of comparatives—do not generate Sorites arguments.

69. Sorites-sentences are context-sensitive; the sentence "Bob is fast" makes a false statement if Bob is a cheetah with a top speed of 30 mph but a true statement if Bob is a turtle with a top speed of 2 mph.

70. Bob cannot be wealthy simpliciter; he must be wealthy compared to some standard or class.

71. Different tokens of "x is smart" involve comparison to different standards and thus express what are, strictly speaking, different propositions.

72. The term "tall" has the same meaning in "Bob is tall" as it has in "Bob is tall compared to Fred," and therefore "tall" is really elliptical for "tall compared to __."

73. The meaning of a predicate is intimately bound up with the number of argument places it has; predicates of different degrees ipso facto have different meanings.

74. Being "absolutely non-wealthy" involves just as much reference to some standard of comparison as being "comparatively non-wealthy"—it means being non-wealthy relative to every standard.

75. Relativization to a standard is the essence of measurement; to measure is to compare with something taken as a standard.

76. Degree-statements, even highly generic ones like "x is acidic to some positive degree," always presuppose some benchmark.

================================================================================

LIBET EXPERIMENT AND FREE WILL

77. Libet's experiment shows that the conscious events people believe to be their decisions are not the operative intentions—consciousness of intention follows rather than precedes the intention itself.

78. The readiness potential (RP) is obviously the proximal psychological cause of the action; therefore W (the conscious awareness) is not the intention but an awareness of the intention.

79. By the time W happens, the RP is almost complete; if W is part of the intention, it is a subordinate part with at most a facilitating function.

80. W is not a mere epiphenomenon because consciousness of one's intentions necessarily affects subsequent thought and behavior.

81. The evidence suggests W is not a part of the operative intention but rather an awareness of it; W happens very late in the process.

82. If W were the decision responsible for the finger-movement, the graph would inflect upwards after W, not fail to inflect or inflect negatively.

83. W cannot possibly be an intention, let alone a decision, since such things are by their nature decisive causes, and W is not decisive.

84. Libet's veto experiment provides evidence that W can at least put the brakes on an already-initiated action, even if it cannot initiate actions.

85. Libet's experiment concerns a subset of actions—real-time sensory-motor engagements with one's environment—but these are actions where consciousness is presumably most heavily involved.

86. Standing intentions (enduring psychological structures like "my intention to create a trading platform") demonstrably cannot be constituents of consciousness; one can be conscious of them, but they are not themselves constituents of consciousness.

87. Libet's experiment shows that we do not have "conscious free will"; our decisions, even those governing real-time responses to the environment, are not constituents of consciousness.

88. The .2 second delay between intention and awareness is very possibly not mere "tape-delay" but reflects W's function as an action-monitor rather than action-instigator.

89. Follow-up studies using fMRI show that relevant RPs began much earlier than Libet thought, sometimes preceding W by as much as 10 seconds.

90. What we believe to be choices initiated in consciousness are not initiated in consciousness; they are initiated prior to any conscious awareness of them.

91. It is unclear how Libet's results bear on "whether we have free will," but that is because the concept of free will is unclear, not because the experimental findings are unclear.

92. Philosophers have responded very conservatively and defensively to Libet's findings, doing more to obfuscate than to illuminate their significance.

93. Indeterminism threatens freedom; determinism seems to be a prerequisite for freedom.

94. Thoughts that totally lacked a causal basis in a person's pre-existing psychological structures would be mere intrusions, not exercises of agency.

95. We only have freedom to the extent that the world, including ourselves, is deterministic.

96. Neuroscience does not merely show us how intentions and beliefs are physiologically implemented; it gives us counterintuitive information about them.

97. Libet's experimental data cannot be dismissed as margin-of-error; the subject established the time of W by coordinating it with a clock making one full rotation every 500 ms.

98. The distinction between proximal and distal intentions is valid, but distal intentions are extremely unlikely to be more consciousness-based than proximal intentions.

99. The actions studied in Libet's experiment are textbook cases of bona fide actions—non-automatic, non-reflexive, "freely made" actions—not quasi-reflexes.

100. The RP obviously causes the finger-movement; either that or it is temporally coincident with whatever the cause is—either way, W is not the operative intention.

101. The idea that we "just know" we have free will is straightforwardly question-begging; free will, if it exists, is a form of causation, and what causes what is always an open empirical question.

102. Compatibilism says you are free even though determined, but Libet's experiment shows not so much that you are determined as that you are on the sidelines—by the time you appear, the decision has been made.

103. What is ominous about the Libet Experiment is not that it shows your choices to be predetermined but that it shows them not to be yours—they are yours to behold but not to make.

104. Libet's results are even more radical than Freud's: Freud regarded consciousness as a weak but genuine central authority; Libet shows it to be a mere spectator.

105. All developed philosophical positions on human agency assume that the events we regard as our conscious choices are indeed our conscious choices; Libet's experiment shows this to be false.

106. One purpose of consciousness may be to integrate information about the external world with information about the internal world.

107. W, though not the cause of a particular intention, may implicitly green-light future similar intentions—telling the relevant part of the mind to carry on apace.

108. The "illusion of free choice"—experiencing decision-approval as decision-making—may be a small price to pay for gains in cognitive efficiency.

================================================================================

BERKELEY AND ANTI-FOUNDATIONALISM

109. Wilfred Sellars destroyed "the myth of the given" and began a revolution in epistemology, but Berkeley made essentially the same points two hundred years earlier.

110. The foundationalist picture holds that no empirical background knowledge is needed to obtain knowledge of external reality—a given perception can do that on its own.

111. Sellars is not denying that external realities are made known to us through sense-perceptions, but attacking the idea that perception does so without the cooperation of preexisting empirical knowledge.

112. There are two senses in which knowledge is not "given": its existence presupposes a background of empirical knowledge, and the sensory experience considered apart from background knowledge does not constitute knowledge of anything.

113. The epistemic significance of a quale is not fixed or "given"; it is a variable function of background empirical knowledge.

114. Berkeley's argument for anti-foundationalism is far more lucid and developed than Sellars' version.

115. What ultimately endows visual sensations with information regarding distances is that different kinds of visual sensations have different kinds of kinesthetic and tactile concomitants.

116. Your visual experience by itself doesn't apprise you of the size or distance of an object; what does that is your visual experience plus various pieces of background knowledge.

117. One's visual experience, taken by itself and stripped of contextualization, doesn't tell one whether one is seeing a tree-size pencil a half-mile off or a tiny pencil nearby.

118. It is only "past experience" that teaches us that a particular appearance betokens a square object rather than a diamond-shaped one.

119. Berkeley has a definite answer to Molyneux's question: a man born blind given sight would not know from visual perceptions alone whether he was seeing a round, oval, or square object.

120. When you hear somebody talk, you feel as though you directly grasp their meaning, but your auditory experience apprises you of significance only with the help of background knowledge.

121. Your visual experiences apprise you of the squareness of objects only in the sense in which your auditory perceptions apprise you of the meaning of a spoken sentence.

122. When a person's face reddens in a particular way indicating shame, your visual experience by itself doesn't apprise you of the shame; background knowledge of how emotions are given bodily expression is at work.

123. No sensory experience by itself tells one anything; any such experience must be put in the context of background knowledge to bear any determinate message about the external world.

124. No sensory experience is foundational; empirical knowledge is obtained by putting current sensory experiences into the context of other sensory experiences and previously obtained empirical knowledge.

125. Sellars only gives one example of how sensory experiences need background knowledge (perception of color under non-standard conditions), while Berkeley's argument directly applies to virtually every perceptible property under standard conditions.

126. Sellars doesn't really explain how representational mental entities (perceptions) are forged out of non-representational mental entities (raw feels, qualia, sensations), but Berkeley goes to great lengths to show this.

127. Berkeley provides a non-metaphorical way of interpreting the metaphors that dominate contemporary anti-foundationalism (the "arc" or "web" of knowledge).

128. Two problems arise on Berkeley-Sellars anti-foundationalism: how any belief manages to be justified, and how anything representational arises out of what is not representational.

129. The problem of how perceptions arise out of non-representational sensations is more fundamental than the problem of justification, because until we have perceptions, the problem of justification doesn't arise.

130. Standard conditions of perception are an idealization; no conditions are really standard—if we could set up a distortion-free situation, it would not be typical.

131. What Sellars says about Bob's intake of color-facts in a tie-shop with unusual lighting is true of our intake of color-facts in general, and of shape-facts, size-facts, distance-facts, and so on.

132. A ten-foot stop-sign looked at from a hundred feet away gives off the same appearance as a 1,000-foot stop-sign looked at from 10,000 feet away; one knows the approximate height only through background information.

133. In the absence of background empirical knowledge, our sensory episodes become indeterminate to the point of meaninglessness—to the point of having no representational content.

134. The appearance given off by a receding object is not different from the appearance given off by a shrinking object; contextual information (knowing that people don't shrink) disambiguates the visual experience.

================================================================================

ADDITIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS

135. The concept of "free will" is so unclear that difficulties in applying experimental findings to it reflect problems with the concept, not with the findings.

136. Philosophers seldom ask "What does the Libet experiment show?" but instead ask "What does the experiment show about free will?"—the second question concedes too much validity to assumptions that the experiment calls into question.

137. Nothing is gained, and much is lost, by trying to press experimental results into the service of a pre-existing philosophical agenda.

138. The position that pre-W brain activity is merely an "urge" that W converts into a genuine intention is question-begging; W does not have a decisive role in causing the finger-movement.

139. If W happened at the very beginning or peak of the readiness potential slope, it could be a decision; but W happens far too late to launch the process and too early to transform it.

140. The comparison between knowledge of free will and the cogito is misconceived; the cogito registers an analytic truth whose negation is incoherent, but the assertion of free will is not trivial.

141. Actions studied in Libet's experiment were set up to maximize the role of consciousness; the subject was wide awake, given explicit instructions, and could push the button whenever he wanted.

142. The more deliberation and "rational reflection" are involved in an action, the less likely the operative intention is to be fully conscious.

143. Philosophers have done little beyond playing skeptic with Libet's data, using standards of proof by which there would be no reason to believe that smoking causes cancer.

144. We stand to learn about the mind by investigating models consistent with Libet's data; we do not stand to learn by insisting that Libet "must" be wrong.

145. Libet's experiment represents an extremely valuable but missed opportunity for philosophy.

146. If it turns out that Libet's data is spurious, so be it; in the meantime, we should accept it and try to model it rather than reflexively dismissing it.

147. The experiments in question do not merely support but establish that consciousness of intention follows rather than precedes the intention itself.

148. Consciousness may serve to approve or disapprove of decisions already made rather than to make decisions, with disapproval having a directive role for future intentions.

149. There is no experimental data to support the claim that Libet's results only apply to "low-level" actions that fail to engage rationality or agency.

150. Any episode of taking in information about the external world—any perception of height, speed, shape, or color—involves the cooperation of contextual or background information.
