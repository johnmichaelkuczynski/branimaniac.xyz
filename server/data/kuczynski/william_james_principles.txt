by 
judiciously

those 
who 
are 
just

of 
the

Ihavekeptclosetothepointofviewofnaturalsciencethroughout 
the 
book. 
Every 
natural 
science 
assumes 
certain 
data 
uncritically, 
and 
declinestochallengetheelementsbetweenwhichitsown'laws'obtain, 
and 
from 
which 
its 
own 
deductions 
are 
carried 
on. 
Psychology, 
the 
scienceoffiniteindividualminds,assumesasitsdata(1)thoughtsandfeelings, 
and 
(2) 
a 
physical 
world 
in 
time 
and 
space 
with 
which 
they 
coexist 
and 
which 
(3) 
they 
know. 
Of 
course 
these 
data 
themselves 
are 
discussable;butthediscussionofthem(asofotherelements)iscalledmetaphysics 
and 
falls 
outside 
the 
province 
of 
this 
book. 
This 
book,
assumingthatthoughtsandfeelingsexistandarevehiclesofknowledge, 



thereupon 
contends 
that 
psychology 
when 
she 
has 
ascertained 
the 
empirical 
correlation 
of 
the 
various 
sorts 
of 
thought 
or 
feeling 
with 
definite 
conditions 
ofthebrain, 
can 
go 
nofarther 
--can 
gonofarther, 
that 
is, 
as 
a, 
natural 
science. 
If 
she 
goes 
farther 
she 
becomes 
metaphysical. 
Allattemptstoexplainourphenomenallygiventhoughtsasproductsofdeeper-lyingentities(whetherthelatterbenamed'Soul,' 
'TranscendentalEgo,''Ideas,'or'ElementaryUnitsofConsciousness')are 
metaphysical.Thisbookconsequentlyrejectsboththeassociationistand 
the 
spiritualist 
theories; 
and 
in 
this 
strictly 
positivistic 
point 
of 
view 
consiststheonlyfeatureofitforwhichIfeeltemptedtoclaimoriginality.
Of 
course 
this 
point 
of 
view 
is 
anything 
but 
ultimate. 
Men 
must 
keepthinking;andthedataassumedbypsychology,justlikethoseassumedby 
physics 
and 
the 
other 
natural 
sciences, 
must 
some 
time 
be 
overhauled. 
The 
effort 
to 
overhaul 
them 
clearly 
and 
thoroughly 
is 
metaphysics; 
but 
metaphysics 
can 
only 
perform 
her 
task 
well 
when 
distinctly 
conscious 
of 
its 
great 
extent. 
Metaphysics 
fragmentary,
irresponsible,andhalf-awake,andunconsciousthatsheismetaphysical,
spoils 
two 
good 
things 
when 
she 
injects 
herself 
into 
a 
natural 
science. 
And 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
the 
theories 
both 
of 
a 
spiritual 
agent 
and 
of 
associated 
'ideas'are,astheyfigureinthepsychology-books,justsuchmetaphysicsasthis.Eveniftheirresultsbetrue,itwouldbeaswellto 
keep 
them, 
as 
thus 
presented, 
out 
of 
psychology 
as 
it 
is 
to 
keep 
the 
resultsofidealismoutofphysics. 


I 
have 
therefore 
treated 
our 
passing 
thoughts 
as 
integers, 
and 
regarded 
the 
mere 
laws 
of 
their 
coexistence 
with 
brain-states 
as

the 
best

of 
health 
that 
a

can

is

The 
Scope 
of 
Psychology 


PsychologyistheScienceofMentalLife,bothofitsphenomenaandoftheir 
conditions. 
The 
phenomena 
are 
such 
things 
as 
we 
call 
feelings,
desires,cognitions,reasonings,decisions,andthelike;and,superficiallyconsidered, 
their 
variety 
and 
complexity 
is 
such 
as 
to 
leave 
a 
chaotic 
impression 
on 
the 
observer. 
The 
most 
natural 
and 
consequently 
the 
earliest 
way 
of 
unifying 
the 
material 
was, 
first, 
to 
classify 
it 
as 
well 
as

in 
Britain,

faint 
or

and 
showing 
how, 
by 
their 
cohesions, 
repulsions, 
and 
forms 
of 
succession, 
such 
things 
as 
reminiscences, 
perceptions,
emotions,volitions,passions,theories,andalltheotherfurnishingsofanindividual's 
mind 
may 
be 
engendered.

as 
spiritualists, 
try 
to 
explain 
our 
memory's 
failures 
and 
blunders 
by 
secondary 
causes. 
But 
its 
successes 
can 
invoke 
no

simply 
be

if 
we 
are

at

Andyettheadmissionisfarfrombeingasatisfactorysimplificationof

Why 
should

our

of

Why 
should

fevers, 
asphyxia,

resuscitate

And

one,-the

is, 
on 
the

safer 
under 
the 
circumstances 
for 
bringing 
it

So 
far 
the

has 
a 
teleological 
character; 
but 
such 
mere 
outward 
teleology 
as 
this 
might 
still 
be 
the 
blind 
result 
of 
vis 
a 
tergo. 
The 
growth 
and 
movements 
of 
plants, 
the 
processes 
of 
development, 
digestion, 
secretion, 
etc., 
in 
animals, 
supply 
innumerable 
instances 
of 
performances 
useful 
to 
the 
individual 
which 
mayneverthelessbe,andbymostofusaresupposedtobe,producedby

When,

These

usually 
the

character 
of

the 
animal's

this 
circumstance 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
its 
perils 
or 
secure 
its 
benefits, 
as 
the 
case 
may

take 
a

my

first

then

and 
my

to 
the 
airwaves 
falling 
on

If

These 
three 
responses 
to 
a 
sensational 
stimulus 
differ, 
however, 
in 
many 
respects. 
The 
closure 
of 
the 
eye 
and 
the 
lachrymation 
are 
quite 
involuntary, 
and 
so 
is 
the 
disturbance 
of 
the 
heart. 
Such 
involuntary 
responsesweknowas'reflex'acts.Themotionofthearmstobreakthe

Actions 
of 
this 
kind, 
into 
which 
instinct 
and 
volition 
enter 
upon 
equal 
terms, 
have 
been 
called 
'semi-reflex.' 
The 
act 
of 
running 
towards 
the 
train,ontheotherhand,hasnoinstinctiveelementaboutit.Itispurely 
the 
result 
of 
education, 
and 
is 
preceded 
by 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
purpose 
to 
be 
attained 
and 
a 
distinct 
mandate 
of 
the 
will. 
It 
is 
a 
'voluntary 
act.' 
Thus 
the 
animal's 
reflex 
and 
voluntary 
performances 
shade 
into 
each 
other 
gradually, 
being 
connected 
by 
acts 
which 
may 
often 
occur 
automatically, 
but 
may 
also 
be 
modified 
by 
conscious 
intelligence. 


An 
outside 
observer, 
unable 
to 
perceive 
the 
accompanying 
consciousness, 
might 
be 
wholly 
at 
a 
loss 
to 
discriminate 
between 
the 
automaticactsandthosewhichvolitionescorted.Butifthecriterionof 
mind'sexistencebethechoiceofthepropermeansfortheattainmentof 
a 
supposed 
end, 
all 
the 
acts 
seem 
to 
be 
inspired 
by 
intelligence, 
for 
appropriateness 
characterizes 
them 
all 
alike. 
This 
fact, 
now, 
has 
led 
to 
two 
quite 
opposite 
theories 
about 
the 
relation 
to 
consciousness 
of 
the 
nervousfunctions.Someauthors,findingthatthehighervoluntaryones 
seem 
to 
require 
the 
guidance 
of 
feeling, 
conclude 
that 
over 
the 
lowest 
reflexes 
some 
such 
feeling 
also 
presides, 
though 
it 
may 
be 
a 
feeling 
of 
which 
we 
remain 
unconscious. 
Others, 
finding 
that 
reflex 
and 
semiautomatic 
acts 
may, 
notwithstanding 
their 
appropriateness, 
take 
place 
with 
an 
unconsciousness 
apparently 
complete, 
fly 
to 
the 
oppositeextremeandmaintainthattheappropriatenessevenofvoluntaryactions 
owes 
nothing 
to 
the 
fact 
that

attends 
them.

method 
the

The

in

in

an

removes 
them; 
that 
is, 
with 
no 
extreme 
precautions 
as 
to 
the 
purity 
of 
the 
operation. 
We 
shall 
in 
this 
way 
reach 
a 
very 
simple 
conception 
of 
the 
functions 
of 
the 
various

involving 
the 
strongest

The 
most 
striking 
character 
of 
all 
these 
movements, 
after 
their 
teleological 
appropriateness, 
is 
their 
precision. 
They 
vary, 
in 
sensitive 
frogs 
and 
with 
a 
proper 
amount 
of 
irritation, 
so 
little 
as 
almost

this, 
and 
by 
cutting 
the 
spinal 
cord 
in 
various 
places 
find 
that 
its 
separate 
segments 
are 
independent 
mechanisms, 
for 
appropriate 
activities 
of 
the 
head 
and 
of 
the 
arms 
and 
legs 
respec-tively. 
The 
segment 
governing 
the 
arms 
is 
especially 
active, 
in 
male 
frogs, 
in 
the 
breeding 
season; 
and 
these 
members 
alone

When, 
finally, 
a 
frog's 
cerebral 
hemispheres 
alone 
are 
cut 
off 
by 
a 
section 
between 
them 
and 
the

Such 
are 
the 
phenomena 
commonly 
observed, 
and 
such 
the 
impressions 
which 
one 
naturally 
receives. 
Certain 
general 
conclusions 
followirresistibly.Firstofallthefollowing: 


Theactsofallthecentresinvolvetheuseofthesamemuscles.When 
a 
headless 
frog's 
hind 
leg 
wipes 
the 
acid, 
he 
calls 
into 
play 
all 
the 
leg-
muscles 
which 
a 
frog 
with 
his 
full 
medulla 
oblongata 
and 
cerebellum 
uses 
when 
he 
turns 
from 
his 
back 
to 
his 
belly. 
Their 
contractions 
are,
however,combineddifferentlyinthetwocases,sothattheresultsvarywidely. 
We 
must 
consequently 
conclude 
that 
specific 
arrangements 
of 
cellsandfibresexistinthecordforwiping, 
inthemedullaforturning 
over, 
etc. 
Similarly 
they 
exist 
in 
the 
thalami 
for 
jumping 
over 
seen 
obstacles 
and 
for 
balancing 
the 
moved 
body; 
in 
the 
optic 
lobes 
for 
creeping 
backwards, 
or 
what 
not. 
But 
in 
the 
hemispheres, 
since 
the 
presenceoftheseorgansbringsnonewelementaryformofmovement 



with 
it, 
but 
only 
determines 
differently 
the 
occasions 
on 
which 
the 
movementsshalloccur,makingtheusualstimulilessfatalandmachinelike; 
we 
need 
suppose 
no 
such 
machinery 
directly 
co-ordinative 
of 
muscular 
contractions 
to 
exist. 
We 
may 
rather 
assume, 
when 
the 
mandateforawiping-movementissentforthbythehemispheres,thatacurrent 
goes 
straight 
to 
the 
wiping-arrangement 
in 
the 
spinal 
cord,
excitingthisarrangementasawhole.Similarly,ifanintactfrogwishestojump 
over 
a 
stone 
which

all 
he 
need 
do 
is 
to 
excite

the 
hemispheresthejumping-centreinthethalamiorwhereveritmaybe,
and 
the 
latter 
will 
provide 
for 
the 
details 
of 
the 
execution.

Those 
reactions 
upon 
complex 
circumstances 
which 
we 
call 
instinctive 
rather 
than 
reflex, 
are 
already 
in 
this

GeneralNotionofHemispheres. 


All 
these 
facts 
lead 
us, 
when 
we 
think 
about 
them, 
to 
some 
such 



explanatory 
conception 
as 
this: 
The 
lower 
centres 
act 
from 
present 
sensational 
stimuli 
alone; 
the 
hemispheres 
act 
from 
perceptions 
and 
considerations, 
thesensations 
whichtheymay 
receive, 
serving 
only 
as 
suggesters 
of 
these. 
But 
what 
are 
perceptions 
but 
sensations 
groupedtogether?andwhatareconsiderationsbutexpectations,inthefancy,ofsensations 
which 
will 
be 
felt 
one 
way 
or 
another 
according 
as 
action 
takes 
this 
course 
or 
that?

But 
all 
these 
images 
are 
constructed 
out 
of 
my 
past 
experiences. 
They 
are 
reproductions 
of 
what 
I 
have 
felt 
or 
witnessed. 
They 
are, 
in 
short, 
remote 
sensations; 
and

Thehemisphereswouldthenseemtobetheseatofmemory.Vestigesof 
past 
experience 
must 
in 
some 
way 
be 
stored 
up 
in 
them, 
and 
must, 
when 
aroused 
by 
present 
stimuli, 
first 
appear 
as 
representations 
of 
distant 
goods 
and 
evils; 
and 
then 
must

But 
the

Nerve-currents

whilst

ideas 
in

All

TheLocalizationofFunctionsintheHemispheres. 



Up 
to 
1870, 
the 
opinion 
which 
prevailed 
was 
that 
which 
the 
experimentsofFlourensonpigeons'brainshadmadeplausible,namely, 
that 
the 
different 
functions 
of 
the 
hemi-spheres 
were 
not 
locally 
separated, 
butcarriedoneachbytheaidofthewholeorgan. 
Hitzigin 
1870 
showed, 
however, 
that 
in 
a 
dog's 
brain 
highly 
specialized 
movements 
could 
be 
produced 
by 
electric 
irritation 
of 
determinate 
regions 
of 
the 
cortex; 
and 
Ferrier 
and 
Munk, 
half 
a 
dozen 
years 
later, 
seemed 
to 
prove, 
either 
by 
irritations 
or 
excisions 
or 
both, 
that 
there 
were 
equally 
determinate 
regions 
connected 
with 
the 
senses 
of 
sight, 
touch, 
hearing, 
and 
smell. 
Munk's 
special 
sensorial 
localizations, 
however, 
disagreed 
with 
Ferrier's; 
and 
Goltz, 
from 
his 
extirpation-
experiments, 
came 
to 
a 
conclusion 
adverse 
to 
strict 
localization 
of 
any 
kind.Thecontroversyisnotyetover.Iwillnotpretendtosayanythingmoreofithistorically,butgiveabriefaccountoftheconditioninwhichmattersatpresentstand. 


The 
one 
thing 
which 
is 
perfectly 
well 
established 
is 
this, 
that 
the 
'central' 
convolutions, 
on 
either 
side 
of 
the 
fissure 
of 
Rolando, 
and 
(at 
least 
in 
the 
monkey) 
the 
calloso-marginal 
convolution 
(which 
is 
continuous 
with 
them 
on 
the 
mesial 
surface 
where 
one 
hemisphere 
is 
applied 
against 
the 
other), 
form 
the 
region 
by 
which 
all 
the 
motor 
incitations 
which 
leave 
the

pass 
out, 
on 
their 
way 
to 
those 
executivecentresintheregionofthepons,medulla,andspinalcordfromwhich 
themuscular 
contractionsare 
dischargedin 
the 
last

The 
existence 
of 
this 
so-called 
'motor

is 
established 
by 
the 
lines 
of

According

the

also 
become

(see

These

between

either

Where

in

the

Now 
whenever 
a 
patient 
dies 
in 
such 
a 
condition 
as 
this, 
and 
an 
examinationofhisbrainispermitted,itisfoundthatthelowestfrontal 
gyrus 
(see 
Fig. 
11) 
is 
the 
seat 
of 
injury. 
Broca 
first 
noticed 
this 
fact 
in 
1861, 
and 
since 
then 
the 
gyrus 
has 
gone 
by 
the 
name 
of 
Broca's 
convolution. 


The 
injury 
in 
right-handed 
people 
is 
found 
on 
the 
left 
hemisphere, 
andinleft-handedpeopleontherighthemisphere.Mostpeople,infact,
areleft-brained,thatis,alltheirdelicateandspecializedmovementsarehanded 
over 
to 
the 
charge 
of 
the 
left 
hemisphere. 
The 
ordinary 
right-
handedness 
for 
such 
movements 
is 
only 
a 
consequence 
of 
that 
fact, 
a 
consequence 
which 
shows 
outwardly 
on 
account 
of 
that 
extensive 
decussationofthefibreswherebymostofthosefromthelefthemisphere 
pass 
to 
the 
right 
half 
of 
the 
body 
only. 
But 
the 
left-brainedness 
might 
exist 
in 
equal 
measure 
and 
not 
show 
outwardly. 
This 
would 
happenwhereverorgansonbothsidesofthebodycouldbegovernedbythelefthemisphere;andjustsuchacaseseemsofferedbythevocalorgans,inthat 
highly 
delicate 
and 
special 
motor 
service 
which 
we 
call 
speech. 
Either 
hemisphere 
can 
innervate 
them 
bilaterally, 
just 
as 
either 
seems 
able 
to 
innervate 
bilaterally 
the 
muscles 
of 
the 
trunk, 
ribs, 
and 
diaphragm. 
Of 
the 
special 
movements 
of 
speech, 
how-ever, 
it 
would 
appear 
(from 
the 
facts 
of 
aphasia) 
that 
the 
left

It 
will 
be 
noticed 
that 
Broca's

is 
homologous 
with 
the

Sight. 


Ferrier 
was 
the 
first 
in 
the 
field 
here. 
He 
found, 
when 
the 
angular 
convolution 
(that 
lying 
between 
the 
'intra 
parietal' 
and 
'external 
occipital'fissures,andbendingroundthetopofthefissureofSylvius,in

as 
if

vision 
occurred; 
and 
that 
when 
it 
was 
extirpated, 
what 
he 
supposed 
to 
be 
total 
and 
permanent 
blindness 
of 
the 
opposite 
eye 
followed. 
Munk 
almost 
immediately 
declared 
total 
and 
permanentblindnesstofollowfromdestructionoftheoccipitallobeinmonkeysaswell 
as 
dogs, 
and 
said 
that 
the 
angular 
gyrus 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
sight,butwasonlythecentrefortactilesensibilityoftheeyeball.Munk's 
absolute 
tone 
about 
his 
observations 
and 
his 
theoretic 
arrogance 
have 
ledtohisruinasanauthority.Buthedidtwothingsofpermanentvalue. 
He 
was 
the 
first 
to 
distinguish 
in 
these 
vivisections 
between 
sensorial 
andpsychicblindness,andtodescribethephenomenonofrestitutionofthe 
visual 
function 
after 
its 
first 
impairment 
by 
an 
operation; 
and 
the 
first 
to 
notice 
the 
hemiopic 
character 
of 
the 
visual 
disturbances 
which 
result 
when 
only 
one 
hemisphere 
is 
injured. 
Sensorial

Ahemiopicdisturbanceofvisionis

Later

of 
all 
the 
disturbances 
of

from 
injury 
to 
a 
single 
hemisphere 
in 
the

Goltz 
almost 
simultaneously 
with 
Ferrier 
and 
Munk 
reported 
experiments 
which 
led 
him 
to 
deny 
that 
the 
visual 
function 
was 
essentiallyboundupwithanyonelocalizedportionofthehemispheres.
Other 
divergent 
results 
soon 
came 
in 
from 
many

that,
withoutgoingintothehistoryofthematteranymore,Imayreporttheexistingstateofthecaseasfollows:14 


Infishes,frogs,andlizardsvisionpersistswhenthehemispheresareentirely

This 
is 
admitted 
for 
frogs 
and 
fishes 
even 
by 
Munk, 
whodeniesitforbirds. 


All 
of 
Munk's 
birds 
seemed 
totally 
blind 
(blind 
sensorially) 
after 
removalofthehemispheresbyhisoperation.Thefollowingofacandlebytheheadandwinkingatathreatenedblow,whichareordinarilyheldtoprovetheretentionofcrudeopticalsensationsbythelowercentresinsupposedhemispherelesspigeons,

But 
Schrader, 
who 
operated

and 
with

InpresenceofsuchdiscordasthatbetweenMunkandhisopponents

should 
be 
observed 
ninety-nine 
times 
and 
the 
preservation 
only 
once 
in 
a 
hundred 
similar 
excisions. 
That 
birds 
and 
mammals 
can 
be 
blinded 
by 
cortical 
ablation 
is 
undoubted; 
the 
onlyquestionis,musttheybeso?Onlythencanthecortexbecertainlycalled 



the

The 
blindness 
may 
always 
be 
due 
to

of 
the 
cut-out 
region 
must 
from 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
case 
be 
permanent. 
Blindness

as 
we 
pass 
to 
mammals 
we 
shall 
see 
still 
more 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
remark. 


In 
rabbits 
loss 
of 
the 
entire 
cortex 
seems 
compatible 
with 
the 
preservationofenoughsighttoguidethepooranimals'movements,and 
enablethemtoavoidobstacles.Christiani'sobservationsanddiscussions 
seemconclusivelytohaveestablishedthis,althoughMunkfoundthatallhisanimalsweremadetotallyblind.16 


In 
dogs 
also 
Munk 
found 
absolute 
stone-blindness 
after 
ablation 
of 
the 
occipital 
lobes. 
He 
went 
farther 
and 
mapped 
out 
determinate 
portions 
of 
the 
cortex 
thereupon, 
which 
he 
considered 
correlated 
with 
definite 
segments 
of 
the 
two 
retinae, 
so 
that 
destruction 
of 
given 
portions 
of 
the 
cortex 
produces 
blindness 
of 
the 
retinal 
centre,

namely, 
as 
the 
expression 
of 
an 
increased 
inertia 
in 
the 
whole 
optical 
machinery, 
of 
which 
the 
result 
is 
to

for 
simply

dogs, 
in 
places 
to 
which 
they 
are 
accustomed, 
show 
little 
of 
their

and 
avoid 
all

whilst

Ferrier 
found 
no 
'appreciableimpairment'ofitafteralmostcompletedestructionofthem 
on 
both 
sides. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
he 
found 
complete

although 
Ferrier 
found

to

This

was 
probably 
due 
to

hand, 
however, 
we 
cannot 
vivisect,

must 
wait 
for 
pathological 
lesions 
to 
turn 
up. 
The

The 
method 
of 
degeneration 
corroborates 
the

evidence 
localizing 
the 
tracts 
of 
vision. 
In 
young 
animals 
one 
gets 
secondary

of 
the 
occipital 
regions 
from 
destroying 
an

What 
Broca's 
discovery 
was 
we 
have 
seen. 
Wernicke 
was 
the 
first 
to 
discriminatethosecasesinwhichthepatientcannotevenunderstandspeech 
from 
those 
in 
which 
he 
can 
understand, 
only 
not 
talk; 
and 
to 
ascribe 
the 
former 
condition 
to 
lesion 
of 
the 
temporal 
lobe.35 
The 
condition 
in 
question 
is 
word-deafness, 
and 
the 
disease 
is 
auditory 
aphasia. 
The 
latest 
statistical 
survey 
of 
the 
subject 
is 
that 
by 
Dr. 
Allen 
Starr.36Inthesevencasesofpureword-deafnesswhichhehascollected, 



casesinwhichthepatientcouldread,talk,andwrite,butnotunderstandwhat

said

i.e. 
left-brained, 
persons) 
is 
always 
on 
the 
left 
side, 
like 
the 
lesion 
in 
motor 
aphasia.

enter 
into

with 
the 
things 
which 
they 
represent, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
and 
with 
the 
movements 
necessary 
for 
pronouncing 
them, 
on 
the 
other. 
In 
a 
large 
majority 
of 
Dr. 
Starr's 
fifty 
cases, 
the 
power 
either 
to 
name 
objects 
or 
to 
talk 
coherently 
was 
impaired.Thisshowsthatinmostofus(asWernickesaid)speechmust 
go

from

that 
is, 
it 
must 
be 
that 
our 
ideas 
do 
not 
innervate 
our 
motor 
centres 
directly, 
but 
only 
after 
first 
arousing 
the 
mental 
sound 
of 
the 
words. 
This 
is 
the 
immediate 
stimulus 
to 
articulation; 
and 
where 
the 
possibility 
of 
this 
is

Interesting 
problems 
arise 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
seat 
of 
tactile 
and 
muscular 
sensibility. 
Hitzig, 
whose 
experiments 
on 
dogs' 
brains 
fifteen 
years 
ago 
opened 
the 
entire 
subject 
which 
we 
are 
discussing, 
ascribed 
thedisordersofmotilityobservedafterablationsofthemotorregiontoalossofwhathecalledmuscularconsciousness. 


The 
animals

Whatisthetruth?Asregardsthefactof

from 
motor-zone 
ablations, 
all 
other 
observers 
are 
against 
Ferrier, 
so 
that 
he 
is 
probably 
wrong 
in 
denying 
it. 
On 
the 
otherhand,MunkandSchiffarewronginmakingthemotorsymptomsdepend 
on 
the 
anaesthesia, 
for 
in 
certain 
rare 
cases 
they 
have 
been 
observed 
to 
exist 
not 
only 
without 
insensibility, 
but 
with 
actual 
hyperaesthesiaoftheparts.43Themotorandsensorysymptomsseem,
therefore,tobeindependentvariables. 


In 
monkeys 
the 
latest 
experiments 
are 
those 
of 
Horsley 
and 
Schaefer,44whoseresultsFerrieraccepts.Theyfindthatexcisionofthehippocampalconvolutionproducestransientinsensibilityoftheoppositeside

and 
that

gyrus 
fornicatus 
(the 
part 
just 
below 
the 
'calloso-marginal

in

The 
insensibility 
is 
at 
its 
maximum 
when 
the 
entire 
tract 
comprising 
both 
convolutions 
is 
destroyed. 
Ferrier 
says 
that 
the

Horsley 
and 
Schaefer 
considerit

Luciani 
found 
it

Luciani, 
who 
believes 
that 
the 
motor 
zone 
is 
also 
sensory, 
tries 
to 
minimizethevalueofthisevidencebypointingtotheinsufficiencywithwhichpatientsareexamined.Hehimselfbelievesthatindogsthetactilesphereextendsbackwardsandforwardsofthedirectlyexcitableregion,
intothefrontalandparietallobes(seeFig.20).Nothnagelconsidersthat 
pathological 
evidence 
points 
in

direction;48 
and 
Dr. 
Mills, 
carefully 
reviewing 
the 
evidence, 
adds 
the 
gyri 
fornicatus 
and 
hippocampi 
to 
the 
cutaneo-muscular 
region 
in 
man.49 
If 
one 
compare 
Luciani's 
diagrams 
together 
(Figs. 
14,16, 
19, 
20) 
one 
will 
see 
that 
the 
entireparietalregionofthedog'sskulliscommontothefoursensesof

including 
muscular

It 
may 
be 
that 
the

in

still 
representsinourselvessomethinglikethisprimitivecondition,andthatthe 
surrounding 
parts, 
in 
adapting 
themselves 
more

have 
left 
it 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
carrefour 
through 
which 
they 
send 
currents 
and 
converse. 
That 
it 
should 
be 
connected 
with 
musculo-cutaneous 
feeling 
is, 
however, 
no 
reason 
why

Persons 
whose

in 
its

from 
compression 
of

still 
feel

they

in

the 
sensibility 
might 
survive 
an 
amount 
of 
injury 
there 
by 
which 
the 
motility 
was 
destroyed. 
Nothnagel 
considers 
that 
there 
are 
grounds 
for 
supposing 
the 
muscular 
sense 
to 
be 
exclusively 
connected 
withtheparietallobeandnotwiththemotorzone."Diseaseofthislobe

Man'sConsciousnessLimitedtotheHemispheres 


Butistheconsciousnesswhichaccompaniestheactivityofthecortextheonlyconsciousnessthatmanhas?orarehislowercentresconsciousaswell? 


This 
is 
a 
difficult 
question 
to 
decide, 
how 
difficult 
one 
only 
learnswhenonediscoversthatthecortex-consciousnessitselfofcertainobjects 
can 
be 
seemingly 
annihilated 
in 
any 
good 
hypnotic 
subject 
by 
a 
bare 
wave 
of 
his 
opera-tor's 
hand, 
and 
yet 
be 
proved 
by 
circumstantial 
evidencetoexistallthewhileinasplit-offcondition,quiteas'ejective'64 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
subject's 
mind 
as 
that 
mind 
is 
to 
the 
mind 
of 
the 
bystanders.65 
The 
lower 
centres 
themselves 
may 
conceivably 
all 
the 
whilehaveasplit-offconsciousnessoftheirown,similarlyejectivetothecortex-consciousness; 
but 
whether 
they 
have 
it 
or 
not 
can 
never 
be 
known 
from 
merely 
introspective 
evidence. 
Meanwhile 
the 
fact 
that 
occipitaldestructioninmanmaycauseablindnesswhichisapparentlyabsolute(nofeelingremainingeitheroflightordarkoveronehalfofthefieldofview),wouldleadustosupposethatifourloweropticalcentres,
thecorporaquadrigemina,andthalami,dohaveanyconsciousness,itisat

consciousness 
which 
does 
not 
mix 
with 
that 
which 



accompaniesthecorticalactivities,andwhichhasnothingtodowithourpersonal 
Self. 
In 
lower 
animals 
this 
may 
not 
be 
so 
much 
the 
case. 
The 
tracesofsightfound(supra,p.46)indogsandmonkeyswhoseoccipital 
lobes 
were 
entirely 
destroyed, 
may 
possibly 
have 
been 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
thatthelowercentresoftheseanimalssaw,andthatwhattheysawwasnotejectivebutobjectivetotheremainingcortex,i.e.

as

This, 
as 
we 
know, 
is 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
experimenters 
themselves. 
For 
practical 
purposes, 
nevertheless, 
and

TheRestitutionofFunction. 


Another 
problem, 
not 
so 
metaphysical, 
remains. 
The 
most 
generalandstrikingfactconnectedwithcorticalinjuryisthatoftherestorationoffunction.Functionslostatfirstareafterafewdaysorweeksrestored.
Howarewetounderstandthisrestitution? 


Twotheoriesareinthefield: 


1)Restitutionisduetothevicariousactioneitheroftherestofthecortex 
or 
of 
centres 
lower 
down, 
acquiring 
functions 
which 
until 
then 
theyhadnotperformed; 
2) 
It 
is 
due 
to 
the 
remaining 
centres 
(whether 
cortical 
or 
'lower')
resumingfunctionswhichtheyhadalwayshad,butofwhichthewoundhad 
temporarilyinhibitedthe 
exercise. 
Thisis 
the 
viewofwhich 
Goltz 
andBrown-Séquardarethemostdistinguisheddefenders. 
Inhibition 
is 
a 
vera 
causa, 
of 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no 
doubt. 
The 
pneumogastric 
nerve 
inhibits 
the 
heart, 
the 
splanchnic 
inhibits 
the 
intestinal 
movements, 
and 
the 
superior 
laryngeal 
those 
of 
inspiration.
Thenerve-irritationswhichmayinhibitthecontractionofarteriolesare 



innumerable,andreflexactionsareoftenrepressedbythesimultaneousexcitement 
of 
other 
sensory 
nerves. 
For 
all 
such 
facts 
the 
reader 
must 
consult 
the 
treatises 
on 
physiology. 
What 
concerns 
us 
here 
is 
the 
inhibitionexertedbydifferentpartsofthenerve-centres,whenirritated,
ontheactivityofdistantparts.Theflaccidityofafrogfrom'shock,'fora 
minuteorsoafterhismedullaoblongataiscut,isaninhibitionfromtheseatofinjurywhichquicklypassesaway. 


Whatisknownas'surgicalshock'(unconsciousness,pallor,dilatation 
of 
splanchnic 
blood-vessels, 
and 
general 
syncope 
and 
collapse) 
in 
the 
human 
subject 
is 
an 
inhibition 
which 
lasts 
a 
longer 
time. 
Goltz,
Freusberg,andothers,cuttingthespinalcordindogs,provedthatthere 
were 
functions 
inhibited 
still 
longer 
by 
the 
wound, 
but 
which 
reestablished 
themselves 
ultimately 
if 
the 
animal 
was 
kept 
alive. 
The 
lumbarregionofthecordwasthusfoundtocontainindependentvasomotorcentres, 
centresforerec-tion, 
forcontrolofthesphincters, 
etc., 
which 
could 
be 
excited 
to 
activity 
by 
tactile 
stimuli 
and 
as 
readily 
reinhibited 
by 
others 
simultaneously 
applied.67 
We 
may 
therefore 
plausibly 
suppose 
that 
the 
rapid 
reappearance 
of 
motility, 
vision, 
etc.,
aftertheirfirstdisappearanceinconsequenceofacorticalmutilation,isduetothepassingoffofinhibitionsexertedbytheirritatedsurfaceofthewound.Theonlyquestioniswhetherallrestorationsoffunctionmustbeexplainedinthisonesimpleway,orwhethersomepartofthemmaynotbeowingtotheformationofentirelynewpathsintheremainingcentres,

the 
entire 
drift 
of

physiological 
and

speculation 
is 
towards 
enthroning

not

fly 
in 
the 
face 
of 
an 
a

probability, 
but 
we 
find 
ourselves 
compelled 
by 
facts 
to 
suppose 
an 
almost 
incredible 
number 
of

They 
confront 
us 
the 
moment 
we 
ask 
ourselves 
just 
which 
are 
the 
parts 
which 
perform 
the 
functions 
abolished 
by 
an

The 
first

thought 
that

must

the

of 
the 
opposite

Wider 
and 
completer 
observations 
show 
us 
both 
that 
the 
lower 
centres 
are 
more 
spontaneous, 
and 
that 
the 
hemispheres 
are 
more 
automatic, 
thantheMeynertschemeallows. 
Schrader'sobservationsin 
Goltz's 
Laboratory 
on 
hemisphereless 
frogs81 
and 
pigeons82 
give 
an 
idea 
quite 
different 
from 
the 
picture 
of 
these 
creatures 
which 
is 
classically 
current. 
Steiner's83 
observations 
on 
frogs 
already 
went 
a 
goodwayinthesamedirection,showing,forexample,thatlocomotionis 
a 
well-developed 
function 
of 
the 
medulla 
oblongata. 
But 
Schrader, 
by 
greatcareintheoperation, 
andbykeepingthefrogsalongtimealive, 
found 
that 
at 
least 
in 
some 
of 
them 
the 
spinal 
cord 
would 
producemovementsoflocomotionwhenthefrogwassmartlyrousedbyapoke,

Schrader's 
hemispherelessfrogsmovedspontaneously,ateflies,buriedthemselvesin 
the 
ground, 
and 
in 
short 
did 
many 
things 
which 
before 
his 
observations 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
impossible 
unless 
the 
hemispheres 
remained. 
Steinert85 
and 
Vulpian 
have 
remarked 
an 
even 
greater 
vivacity 
in 
fishes 
deprived 
of 
their 
hemispheres. 
Vulpian 
says

by 
these

make 
out 
a 
pretty 
good 
case 
for 
the

as 
applied 
to 
these

But 
the 
Meynert 
scheme 
also 
demands 
that 
the 
reactions 
of 
the 
lower 
centres 
shall 
all 
be

and 
we 
are 
not 
absolutely

Conclusion. 


All 
the 
centres, 
in 
all 
animals, 
whilst 
they 
are 
in 
one 
aspectmechanisms,probablyare,oratleastoncewere,organsofconsciousnessin 
another, 
although 
the 
consciousness 
is 
doubtless 
much 
more 
developed 
in 
the 
hemispheres 
than 
it 
is 
anywhere 
else. 
The 
consciousnessmusteverywhereprefersomeofthesensationswhichitgetstoothers;andifitcanremembertheseintheirabsence, 
however 
dimly, 
they 
must 
be 
its 
ends 
of 
desire. 
If, 
moreover, 
it 
can 
identify 
in 
memory 
any 
motor 
discharges 
which 
may 
have 
led 
to 
such 
ends, 
and 
associatethelatterwiththem,thenthesemotordischargesthemselvesmayinturnbecomedesiredasmeans. 
Thisisthedevelopmentofwill; 
and 
its 
realization 
must 
of 
course 
be 
proportional 
to 
the 
possible 
complication 
of 
the 
consciousness. 
Even 
the 
spinal 
cord 
may 
possibly 
have 
some 
little 
power 
of 
will 
in 
this 
sense, 
and 
of 
effort 
towards 
modifiedbehaviorinconsequenceofnewexperiencesofsensibility.93 


All 
nervous 
centres 
have 
then 
in 
the 
first 
instance 
one 
essential 
function,thatof'intelligent'action.Theyfeel,preferonethingtoanother, 
and 
have 
'ends.' 
Like 
all 
other 
organs, 
however, 
they 
evolve 
from 
ancestor 
to 
descendant, 
and 
their 
evolution 
takes 
two 
directions 
the 
lower 
centres 
passing 
downwards 
into 
more 
unhesitating 
automatism, 
and 
the 
higher 
ones 
upwards 
into 
larger 
intellectuality.94Thus 
it 
may 
happen 
that 
those 
functions 
which 
can 
safely 
grow 
uniform 
and 
fatal 
becomeleastaccompaniedbymind,andthattheirorgan,thespinalcord,
becomes 
a 
more 
and 
more 
soulless 
machine; 
whilst 
on 
the 
contrary 



thosefunctionswhichitbenefitstheanimaltohaveadaptedtodelicateenvironing 
variations 
pass 
more 
and 
more 
to 
the 
hemispheres, 
whose 
anatomicalstructureandattendantconsciousnessgrowmoreandmoreelaborate 
as 
zoological 
evolution 
proceeds. 
In 
this 
way 
it 
might 
come 
about 
that 
in 
man 
and 
the 
monkeys 
the 
basal 
ganglia 
should 
do 
fewer 
things 
by 
themselves 
than 
they 
can 
do 
in 
dogs, 
fewer 
in 
dogs 
than 
in 
rabbits, 
fewer 
in 
rabbits 
than 
in 
hawks,95 
fewer 
in 
hawks 
than 
in 
pigeons,fewerinpigeonsthaninfrogs,fewerinfrogsthaninfishes,andthatthehemispheresshouldcorrespondinglydomore. 
Thispassageoffunctionsforwardtotheever-enlarginghemisphereswouldbeitselfoneof 
the 
evolutive 
changes, 
to 
be 
explained 
like 
the 
development 
of 
the 
hemispheres 
themselves, 
either 
by 
fortunate 
variation 
or 
by 
inheritedeffectsofuse.Thereflexes,onthisview,uponwhichtheeducationofourhuman 
hemispheres 
depends, 
would 
not 
be 
due 
to 
the 
basal 
ganglia 
alone. 
They 
would 
be 
tendencies 
in 
the 
hemispheres 
themselves, 
modifiable 
by 
education, 
unlike 
the 
reflexes 
of 
the 
medulla 
oblongata, 
pons, 
optic 
lobes 
and 
spinal 
cord. 
Such 
cerebral 
reflexes, 
if 
they 
exist,
formabasisquiteasgoodasthatwhichtheMeynertschemeoffers,fortheacquisitionofmemoriesandassociationswhichmaylaterresultinallsortsof'changesofpartners'inthepsychicworld.Thediagramofthe 
baby 
and 
the 
candle 
(see 
page 
25) 
can 
be 
re-edited, 
if 
need 
be, 
as 
an 
entirely 
cortical 
transaction. 
The 
original 
tendency 
to 
touch 
will 
be 
a 
cortical 
instinct; 
the 
burn 
will 
leave 
an 
image 
in 
another 
part 
of 
the 
cortex, 
which, 
being 
recalled 
by 
association, 
will 
inhibit 
the 
touchingtendencythenexttimethecandleisperceived,andexcitethetendencyto 
withdraw-so 
that 
the 
retinal 
picture 
will, 
upon 
that 
next 
time, 
be 
coupled 
with 
the 
original 
motor 
partner 
of 
the 
pain. 
We 
thus 
get 
whatever 
psychological

The 
subject 
belongs 
too 
much 
to 
physiology 
for 
the 
evidence 
to 
be 
citedindetailinthesepages.Iwillthrowintoanoteafewreferencesfor 
suchreadersasmaybe 
interestedinfollowingitout,2andsimplysay 
that 
the 
direct 
electrical 
irritation 
of 
the 
cortical 
centres 
sufficiently 
proves 
the 
point. 
For 
it 
was 
found 
by 
the 
earliest 
experimenters 
here 
that 
whereas 
it 
takes 
an 
exceedingly 
strong 
current

produce 
anymovementwhenasingleinduction-shockisused,arapidsuccessionofinduction-shocks 
('faradization') 
will 
produce 
movements 
when 
the 
current 
is 
comparatively 
weak. 
A 
single 
quotation 
from 
an 
excellent 
investigationwillexhibitthislawunderfurtheraspects: 


"If 
we 
continue 
to

the

it 
is

that

But 
themethodshe

applied

We

say, 
however, 
immediately, 
that 
the

'Velocity

from

The

is 
essentially 
the

A

that 
is, 
it 
is 
a

and

probably 
some 
sortofconsciousnessaccompanyingit.Whatsort? 


Wundt 
has 
little 
difficulty 
in 
deciding 
that 
it 
is 
consciousness 
of 
a 
quite 
elaborate 
kind. 
He 
distinguishes 
between 
two 
stages 
in 
the 
conscious 
reception 
of 
an 
impression, 
calling 
one 
perception, 
and 
the 
other 
apperception, 
and 
likening 
the 
one 
to 
the 
mere 
entrance 
of 
an 
objectintotheperipheryofthefieldofvision,andtheothertoitscomingtooccupythefocusorpointofview.Inattentiveawarenessofanobject, 
and 
attention 
to 
it, 
are, 
itseemsto 
me, 
equivalents 
forperceptionand 
apperception, 
as 
Wundt 
uses 
the 
words. 
To 
these 
two 
forms 
of 
awarenessoftheimpressionWundtaddstheconsciousvolitiontoreact,
gives 
tothe 
triothe 
name 
of 
'psycho-physical' 
processes, 
and 
assumes 
thattheyactuallyfollowuponeachotherinthesuccessioninwhichtheyhavebeennamed.10SoatleastIunderstandhim. 
Thesimplestwaytodeterminethetimetakenupbythispsycho-physicalstageNo.3would 
be 
to 
determine 
separately 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
several 
purely 
physical 
processes, 
1, 
2, 
4, 
and 
5, 
andtosubtractthemfromthetotal 
reactiontime.
Suchattemptshavebeenmade.11Butthedataforcalculationare 
too 
inaccurate 
for 
use, 
and, 
as 
Wundt 
himself 
admits,12 
the 
precise 
duration 
of 
stage 
3 
must 
at 
present 
be 
left 
enveloped 
with 
that 
of 
the 
otherprocesses,inthetotalreaction-time. 


My 
own 
belief 
is 
that 
no 
such 
succession 
of 
conscious 
feelings 
as 
Wundt 
describes 
takes 
place 
during 
stage 
3. 
It 
is 
a 
process 
of 
central 
excitement 
and 
discharge, 
with 
which 
doubtless 
some 
feeling 
coexists, 
but 
what 
feeling 
we 
cannot 
tell, 
because 
it 
is 
so 
fugitive 
and 
so 
immediatelyeclipsedbythemoresubstantiveandenduringmemoryoftheimpressionasitcamein,andoftheexecutedmovementofresponse.

A

it

In 
fact, 
the 
reaction-time 
experiments 
are 
a 
case 
to 
which 
we 
can 
immediately 
apply 
what 
we 
have 
just 
learned 
about 
the 
summation 
of 
stimuli. 
'Expectant 
attention' 
is 
but 
the 
subjective 
name 
for 
what 
objectively 
is 
a 
partial 
stimulation 
of 
a

He 
now 
admits 
that 
in 
the 
shortest 
reactions 
"there 
is 
neither 
apperception 
nor 
will, 
but 
that 
they 
are 
merely 
brain-reflexes 
due 
to 
practice."18 
The 
means 
of 
his 
conversion 
are 
certain 
experiments 
performed 
in 
his 
laboratory 
by 
Herr 
L. 
Lange,19 
who 
was 
led 
to 
distinguish 
between 
two 
ways 
of 
setting 
the 
attention 
in 
reacting 
on 
a 
signal,andwhofoundthattheygaveverydifferenttime-results. 
Inthe 
'extreme 
sensorial' 
way, 
as 
Lange 
calls 
it, 
of 
reacting, 
one 
keeps 
one's 
mind 
as 
intent 
as 
possible 
upon 
the 
expected 
signal, 
and 
'purposely 
avoids'20 
thinking 
of 
the 
movement 
to 
be 
executed; 
in 
the 
'extreme 
muscular'wayone 
'doesnotthinkatall'21ofthesignal,butstandsas 
readyaspossible 
for 
themovement. 
Themuscularreactionsaremuch 
shorter 
than 
the 
sensorial 
ones, 
the 
average 
difference 
being 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
a 
tenth 
of 
a 
second. 
Wundt 
accordingly 
calls 
them 
'shortenedreactions'and,withLange,admitsthemtobemerereflexes; 
whilst 
the 
sensorial 
reactions 
he 
calls 
'complete,' 
and 
holds 
to 
his 
originalconceptionasfarastheyareconcerned.Thefacts,however,do 
not 
seemto 
meto 
warrant 
even 
thisamountoffidelity 
to 
the 
original 
Wundtian 
position. 
When 
we 
begin 
to 
react 
in 
the 
'extreme 
sensorial' 
way,Langesaysthatwegettimessoverylongthattheymustberejectedfromthecountasnon-typical."Onlyafterthereacterhassucceededby

practice

we 
get 
times 
which 
can 
be 
regarded 
as

are 
probably 
the 
real 
'complete

the 
only 
ones 
in 
which 
distinct 
processesof 
actual 
perception 
andvolition 
occur 
(see 
above, 
pp.88-9). 
The

is 
attained 
by

is 
probablyanothersortofreflex,lessperfectthanthereflexespreparedbystraining

They

The

on

(Pflüger'sArchiv,XIV.529). 


Olfactory 
reactions 
have 
been

Vintschgau, 
Buccola,

They 
are

It

Brain-activityseemsaccompaniedbyalocaldisengagementofheat.
The 
earliest 
careful 
work 
in 
this 
direction 
was 
by 
Dr. 
J.S. 
Lombard 
in 
1867. 
Dr. 
Lombard's 
latest 
results 
include 
the 
records 
of 
over 
60,000 
observations.32 
He 
noted 
the 
changes 
in 
delicate 
thermometers 
and 
electricpilesplacedagainst 
the 
scalpinhumanbeings, 
andfound 
that 
any 
intellectual 
effort, 
such 
as 
computing, 
composing, 
reciting 
poetry 
silently 
or 
aloud, 
and 
especially 
that 
emotional 
excitement 
such 
as 
an 
angerfit,causedageneralriseoftemperature,whichrarelyexceededadegree 
Fahrenheit. 
The 
rise 
was 
in 
most 
cases 
more 
marked 
in 
the 
middleregionoftheheadthanelsewhere.Strangetosay,itwasgreater 
in 
reciting 
poetry 
silently 
than 
in 
reciting 
it 
aloud. 
Dr. 
Lombard's 
explanationisthat"ininternalrecitationanadditionalportionofenergy, 
which 
in 
recitation 
aloud, 
was 
converted 
into 
nervous 
and 
muscular 
force,nowappearsasheat."33Ishouldsuggestrather,ifwemusthaveatheory, 
that 
the 
surplus 
of 
heat 
in 
recitation 
to 
one's 
self 
is 
due 
to 
inhibitory 
processes 
which 
are 
absent 
when 
we 
recite 
aloud. 
In 
the 
chapter 
on 
the 
Will 
we 
shall 
see 
that 
the 
simple 
central 
process 
is 
to 
speakwhenwe 
think;to 
thinksilently 
involves 
a 
check 
in 
addition. 
In

Applying 
a

against

he 
found

As

PhosphorusandThought. 


Chemical 
action 
must 
of 
course 
accompany 
brain-activity. 
But 
little 
definite 
is 
known 
of 
its 
exact 
nature. 
Cholesterin 
and 
creatin 
are 
both 
excrementitiousproducts, 
andarebothfoundinthebrain. 
Thesubject 
belongs 
to 
chemistry 
rather 
than 
to 
psychology, 
and 
I 
only 
mention 
it 
here 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
saying 
a 
word 
about 
a 
wide-spread 
popular 
error 
about 
brain-activity 
and 
phosphorus. 
'Ohne 
Phosphor, 
kein 
Gedanke,' 
wasanotedwar-cryofthe 
'materialists'duringtheexcitementonthat 
subject 
which 
filled 
Germany 
in 
the 
'60s. 
The 
brain, 
like 
every 
other 
organofthebody,containsphosphorus,andascoreofotherchemicalsbesides.Whythephosphorusshouldbepickedoutasitsessence,noone 
knows. 
Itwouldbeequallytruetosay

'OhneKochsalzkeinGedanke';forthoughtwouldstopasquicklyifthe 
brain 
should 
dry 
up 
or 
lose 
its 
NaCl 
as 
if 
it 
lost 
its 
phosphorus. 
In 
America 
the 
phosphorus-delusion 
has 
twined 
itself 
round 
a 
saying 
quoted(rightlyorwrongly)fromProfessorL.Agassiz,totheeffectthat

Unfortunately 
we 
cannot 
do 
this 
directly, 
but 
can 
only 
gauge 
the

The 
fact 
that

proves 
nothing

The 
phosphorous-philosophers 
have 
often 
compared 
thought 
to 
a 
secretion."Thebrainsecretesthought,asthekidneyssecreteurine,oras

I 
must 
confess 
to 
finding 
all 
Wundt's 
utterances 
about 
'apperception' 
both 
vacillating 
and 
obscure. 
I 
see 
no 
use 
whatever 
for 
the

as 
he 
employsit,inPsychology.Attention,perception,conception,volition,are

In 
short, 
what 
M. 
Delboeuf 
calls 
an 
'organe

The

so 
soon 
as

admits 
that 
when 
we 
await 
a 
strong 
signal 
with 
tense 
preparation 
there 
is 
no 
consciousness 
of 
any 
duality 
of 
'apperception' 
andmotorresponse;thetwoarecontinuous(Physiol. 
Psych., 
II. 
226).Mr. 
Cattell's 
view 
is 
identical 
with 
the 
one 
I 
defend. 
"I 
think," 
he 
says,
"thatiftheprocessesofperceptionandwillingarepresentatalltheyare 
very 
rudimentary....The 
subject, 
by 
a 
voluntary 
effort[before 
the 
signal 
comes], 
puts 
the 
lines 
of 
communication 
between 
the 
centre 
for 
"the 
stimulus" 
andthecentrefortheco-ordinationofmotions...inastateof 
unstable 
equilibrium. 
When, 
therefore, 
a 
nervous 
impulse 
reaches 
the 
"former 
centre," 
it 
causes 
brain-changes 
in 
two 
directions; 
an 
impulse 
moves 
along 
to 
the 
cortex 
and 
calls 
forth 
there 
a 
perceptioncorrespondingtothestimulus,whileatthesametimeanimpulsefollowsalineofsmallresistancetothecentrefortheco-ordinationofmotions,
andtheproper

andwaitingforthe

is 
sent 
from 
the 
centre 
to 
the 
muscle 
of 
the 
hand. 
When 
the 
reaction 
has 
often 
been 
made 
the 
entire 
cerebral 
process 
becomes 

automatic,theimpulseofitselftakesthewell-travelledwaytothemotorcentreandreleasesthemotorimpulse."(Mind,XI.232-3.)-Finally,Prof.

Habit 


Whenwelookatlivingcreaturesfromanoutwardpointofview,oneofthefirstthingsthatstrikeusisthattheyarebundlesofhabits.Inwild 
animals,theusualroundofdailybehaviorseemsanecessityimplantedatbirth;inanimalsdomesticated, 
andespeciallyinman, 
itseems, 
toa

are 
called 
instincts; 
some 
of 
those 
due 
to 
education 
wouldbymostpersonsbecalledactsofreason.Itthusappearsthathabit 
covers 
a 
very 
large 
part 
of 
life, 
and 
that 
one 
engaged 
in 
studying 
the 
objective 
manifestations 
of 
mind 
is 
bound 
at 
the 
very 
outset 
to 
define 
clearlyjustwhatitslimitsare. 


The 
moment 
one 
tries 
to 
define 
what 
habit 
is, 
one 
is 
led 
to 
the 
fundamentalpropertiesofmatter.ThelawsofNaturearenothingbuttheimmutablehabitswhichthedifferentelementarysortsofmatterfollowin 
their 
actions 
and 
reactions 
upon 
each 
other. 
In 
the 
organic 
world,
however,thehabitsaremorevariablethanthis.Eveninstinctsvaryfrom 
one 
individual 
to 
another 
of 
a 
kind; 
and 
are 
modified 
in 
the 
same 
individual, 
as 
we 
shall 
later 
see, 
to 
suit 
the 
exigencies 
of 
the 
case. 
The 
habits 
of 
an 
elementary 
particle 
of 
matter 
cannot 
change 
(on 
the 
principlesoftheatomisticphilosophy), 
becausetheparticleisitselfanunchangeablething;butthoseofacompoundmassofmattercanchange,
because 
they 
are 
in 
the 
last 
instance 
due 
to 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
compound,andeitheroutwardforcesorinwardtensionscan,fromonehourtoanother,turnthatstructureintosomethingdifferentfromwhatitwas.Thatis,theycandosoifthebodybeplasticenoughtomaintainitsintegrity,andbenotdisruptedwhenitsstructureyields.Thechangeofstructureherespokenofneednotinvolvetheoutwardshape;itmaybeinvisible 
and

as

whichittakestimetoovercome,butthegradualyieldingwhereofoften 
saves 
the 
material 
from 
being 
disintegrated 
altogether. 
When 
the 
structure 
has 
yielded, 
the 
same 
inertia 
becomes 
a 
condition 
of 
its 



comparative 
permanence 
in 
the 
new 
form, 
and 
of 
the 
new 
habits 
the 
body 
then 
manifests. 
Plasticity, 
then, 
in 
the 
wide 
sense 
of 
the 
word, 
means 
the 
possession 
of 
a 
structure 
weak 
enough 
to 
yield 
to 
an 
influence, 
but 
strong 
enough 
not 
to 
yield 
all 
at 
once. 
Each 
relatively 
stable 
phase 
of 
equilibrium 
in 
such 
a 
structure 
is 
marked 
by 
what 
we 
maycallanewsetofhabits. 
Organicmatter, 
especiallynervoustissue, 
seems 
endowed 
with 
a 
very 
extraordinary 
degree 
of 
plasticity 
of 
this 
sort;sothatwemaywithouthesitationlaydownasourfirstpropositionthefollowing,thatthephenomenaofhabitinlivingbeingsareduetotheplasticity2oftheorganicmaterialsofwhichtheirbodiesarecomposed. 


Butthephilosophyofhabitisthus,inthefirstinstance,achapterinphysicsratherthaninphysiologyorpsychology. 
Thatitisatbottoma 
physicalprincipleisadmittedbyallgoodrecentwritersonthesubject.
They 
call 
attention 
to 
analogues 
of 
acquired 
habits 
exhibited 
by 
dead 
matter.Thus,M.LéonDumont,whoseessayonhabitisperhapsthemost 
philosophical 
account 
yet 
published, 
writes: 
"Every 
one 
knows 
how 
a 
garment,afterhavingbeenwornacertaintime,clingstotheshapeofthebodybetterthanwhenitwasnew;therehasbeenachangeinthetissue,
and 
this 
change 
is 
a 
new 
habit 
of 
cohesion. 
A 
lock 
works 
better 
after 
being 
used 
some 
time; 
at 
the 
outset 
more 
force 
was 
required 
to 
overcome 
certain 
roughnesses 
in 
the 
mechanism. 
The 
overcoming 
of 
theirresistanceisaphenomenonofhabituation.Itcostslesstroubleto

Thissavingoftroubleis 
due 
to 
the 
essential 
nature 
of 
habit, 
which 
brings 
it

This 
is 
what

to

that

to 
great 
masters.

In

by 
the 
enormous 
supply 
of 
blood 
which 
it 
receives....It 
is, 
moreover, 
a 
fact 
of 
great 
significance 
that 
the 
nerve-
substance 
is 
specially 
distinguished 
by 
its 
reparative 
power. 
For 
while

"Now, 
in 
this 
constant 
and 
active 
reconstruction 
of

nervous 
system, 
we 
recognize 
a 
most 
marked 
conformity 
to 
the 
general

For,inthefirst 
place, 
it 
is 
obvious 
that 
there 
is

the

and 
the

And 
this 
modifiability 
expresses 
itself 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the

which

The 
need 
of 
securing 
success 
at 
the 
outset 
is 
imperative. 
Failure 
at

is 
apt 
to

A 
third

may 
be 
added 
to 
the

pair:

in 
this 
work-a-day 
world; 
but 
woe 
to 
him 
who 
can 
only 
recognize 
them 
when 
he 
thinks 
them 
in 
their 
pure 
and 
abstract 
form! 
The 
habit 
of 
excessive 
novel-
reading 
and 
theatre-going 
will 
produce 
true 
monsters 
in 
this 
line. 
The 
weeping

a

excessive

in

for 
those

are 
neither 
performersthemselvesnormusicallygiftedenoughtotakeitinapurelyintellectual 
way, 
has 
probably 
a 
relaxing 
effect 
upon 
the 
character. 
One 
becomes 
filled 
with 
emotions 
which 
habitually 
pass 
without 
prompting 
to 
any 



deed, 
and 
so 
the 
inertly 
sentimental 
condition 
is 
kept 
up. 
The 
remedy 
would 
be, 
never 
to 
suffer 
one's 
self 
to 
have 
an 
emotion 
at 
a 
concert,

Theselattercasesmakeusawarethatitisnotsimplyparticularlines 
of

general 
forms 
of 
discharge, 
that 
seem 
to 
be 
grooved 
out 
by 
habit 
in 
the 
brain. 
Just 
as, 
if 
we 
let 
our 
emotions 
evaporate, 
they 
get 
into 
a 
way 
of 
evaporating; 
so 
there 
is 
reason 
to 
supposethatifweoftenflinchfrommakinganeffort,beforeweknowitthe 
effort-making 
capacity 
will 
be 
gone; 
and 
that, 
if 
we 
suffer 
the 
wandering 
of 
our 
attention, 
presently 
it 
will 
wander 
all 
the 
time. 
Attention 
and 
effort 
are, 
as 
we 
shall 
see 
later, 
but 
two 
names 
for

true 
that, 
to 
the 
best 
of 
my 
judgment, 
the 
argumentationwhichappliestobrutesholdsequallygoodofmen;and,
therefore, 
that 
all

it

that

Sometimes 
one

better, 
and 
sometimes 
the

so 
that 
in

a

we 
speak 
sometimes 
of

and 
sometimes 
of

facts.

To 
comprehend 
completely 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
dogma 
so 
confidently 
enunciated, 
one 
should 
unflinchingly 
apply 
it 
to 
the 
most 
complicated 
examples.

all 
this 
without 
in 
the 
slightest 
degree 
acknowledging 
the 
existence 
of 
the

Inlikemannerwemightexhaustivelywritethe

of 
those 
two 
hundred 
pounds,

or 
less, 
of 
warmish 
albuminoid 
matter 
called 
Martin 
Luther, 
without 
ever 
implying 
that 
it 
felt. 


But, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
nothing 
in 
all 
this 
could 
prevent 
us 
from 
givinganequally 
completeaccountofeitherLuther'sorShakespeare's

the

and

in 
the

correspond

but 
not 
react

a

its

Another 
inference, 
apparently 
more 
paradoxical 
still, 
needs 
to 
be 
made,though,asfarasIamaware,Dr.Hodgsonistheonlywriterwho

Toordinarycommonsense,

cause 
of 
such 
inward 
events 
as 
sorrow, 
compunction, 
desire, 
or 
inventive 
thought. 
So 
the 
consciousness 
of 
good 
news 
is 
the 
direct 
producer 
of 
the 
feeling 
of

the

The

whatever

was 
attached 
to

consequently

The 
'conscious

as 
this 
conception 
is 
generally 
called, 
is 
thus 
a 
radical 
and 
simple 
conception 
of

Half

For

A

does 
few 
things,

in

them 
perfectly 
forfeits

Such

Well,justsuchpressureandsuchinhibitionarewhatconsciousness

And 
the

in

it

them 
are 
its

and

We

We

that 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
some 
such 
superadded

intelligence 
(whether 
it 
be 
that

or

Aslongaswekeeptotheconsiderationofpurelyoutwardfacts,eventhemost

our 
task 
as 
evolutionists 
is 
comparatively 
easy. 
We 
are 
dealing 
all

time 
with 
matter 
and 
its 
aggregationsandseparations;andalthoughourtreatmentmustperforcebe

this

from

The

which, 
chaotically

made 
the

and

The 
enemies 
of 
evolution 
have 
been 
quick 
to 
pounce 
upon 
this 
undeniable 
discontinuity 
in 
the 
data 
of 
the 
world, 
and 
many 
of 
them,
fromthefailureofevolutionaryexplanationsatthispoint,haveinferredtheir 
general 
incapacity 
all 
along 
the 
line. 
Every 
one 
admits 
the 
entire 
incommensurabilityoffeelingassuchwithmaterialmotionassuch. 
"A

enthusiasts, 
when 
deliberately 
comparing

havebeenasforwardasanyoneelsetoemphasizethe'chasm'between

"Can 
the 
oscillations 
of 
a

says 
Mr. 
Spencer, 
"be 
represented 
side 
by 
side 
with 
a 
nervous 
shock 
[he 
means 
a 
mental 
shock], 
and 
the

be 
recognized 
as

No

enables 
us 
to 
assimilatethem.Thataunitoffeelinghasnothingincommonwithaunitofmotionbecomesmorethanevermanifestwhenwebringthetwointojuxtaposition."1 


Andagain: 


"Supposeittohavebecomequiteclearthatashockinconsciousnessand

of

In 
other 
words, 
incapable 
of 
perceiving 
in 
them 
any 
common 
character.SoTyndall,inthatluckyparagraphwhichhasbeenquotedsooftenthateveryoneknowsitbyheart: 



"Thepassagefromthephysicsofthebraintothecorrespondingfacts

Orinthisotherpassage: 


"We

and

Nonethelesseasily,however,whentheevolutionaryafflatusisuponthem,

leap 
over 
the 
breach 
whose

And 
Mr.

in 
the

Belfast 
Addressfromwhichwejustquoted,delivershisotherfamouspassage:

SomeAllegedProofsThatMind-DustExists. 


Some 
of 
this 
duty 
we 
find 
already 
performed 
by 
a 
number 
of 
philosophers 
who, 
though 
not 
interested 
at 
all 
in 
evolution, 
have 
nevertheless 
on 
independent 
grounds 
convinced 
themselves 
of 
the 
existenceofavastamountofsub-consciousmentallife.Thecriticismof 
this 
general 
opinion 
and 
its 
grounds 
will 
have 
to 
be 
postponed 
for 
a 
while. 
At 
present 
let 
us 
merely 
deal 
with 
the 
arguments 
assumed 
to 
proveaggregationofbitsofmind-stuffintodistinctly 
sensiblefeelings. 



Theyareclearandadmitofaclearreply. 


TheGermanphysiologistA.Fick,in1862,was,sofarasIknow,the 
first 
to 
use 
them. 
He 
made 
experiments 
on

He 
tried 
to 
show 
how 
a 
different 
manner 
of 
the 
summationmightgiveriseinonecasetotheheatandinanothertothetouch. 


"Afeelingoftemperatures,"hesays,"ariseswhentheintensitiesof

A 
feeling 
of

perhapsarises 
when 
this 
conditionisnotfulfilled.Bothkindsoffeeling,however,arecomposedof 
thesameunits." 


But 
it 
is 
obviously 
far 
clearer 
to 
interpret 
such 
a 
gradation 
of 
intensitiesasabrain-factthanasamind-fact.Ifinthebrainatractwere

Solongasthislatterinterpretationremainsopen,Fickcannotbeheldtohaveprovedpsychicsummation. 


Later,bothSpencerandTaine,independentlyofeachother,tookup 
the 
same 
line 
of 
thought. 
Mr. 
Spencer's 
reasoning 
is 
worth 
quoting 
in 
extenso.Hewrites: 


"Although 
the 
individual 
sensations 
and 
emotions, 
real 
or 
ideal, 
of 
which 
consciousness 
is 
built 
up, 
appear 
to 
be

simple,
homogeneous,unanalyzable,orofinscrutablenatures,yettheyarenot 
so.Thereisatleastonekindoffeelingwhich,asordinarilyexperienced,

On 
this 
supposition 
there 
are 
no 
unperceived 
units 
of 
mind-stuff 
preceding 
and 
composing 
the 
full 
consciousness. 
The 
latter 
is 
itself 
an 
immediate 
psychic 
fact 
and 
bears 
an

I 
will 
therefore 
conclude 
the

with 
some 
consideration 
of 
the 
remaining 
difficulties 
which 
beset 
the 
matter 
as 
it 
at 
present 
stands. 
Difficulty 
of 
Stating 
the 
ConnectionBetweenMindandBrain. 


It 
will 
be 
remembered 
that 
in 
our 
criticism 
of 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
integrationofsuccessiveconsciousunitsintoafeelingofmusicalpitch, 
we 
decided 
that 
whatever 
integration 
there 
was 
was 
that 
of 
the 
air-
pulses 
into 
a 
simpler 
and 
simpler 
sort 
of 
physical 
effect, 
as 
the 
propagations 
of 
material 
change 
got 
higher 
and 
higher 
in 
the 
nervous 
system. 
Atlast,wesaid(p.

the 
feeling 
of

directly 
corresponds.

showusthatthewhole

certain

to

Nevertheless, 
this 
formula 
which 
is 
so 
unobjectionable 
if 
taken 
vaguely, 
positivistically, 
or 
scientifically, 
as 
a 
mere 
empirical 
law 
of 
concomitance 
between 
our 
thoughts 
and 
our 
brain, 
tumbles 
to 
piecesentirelyifweassumetorepresentanythingmoreintimateorultimatebyit. 
The 
ultimate 
of 
ultimate 
problems, 
of 
course, 
in 
the 
study 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
thought 
and 
brain, 
is 
to 
understand 
why 
and 
how

Butbeforethatproblemissolved(ifiteverissolved)thereisalessultimateproblemwhichmustfirstbesettled.Beforetheconnectionofthoughtandbraincanbeexplained,it

Our 
own 
formula 
escapes 
the 
unintelligibility 
of 
psychic 
atoms 
by 
taking 
the 
entire 
thought 
(even 
of 
a 
complex 
object) 
as 
the 
minimum 



with 
which 
it 
deals 
on 
the 
mental 
side. 
But 
in 
taking 
the 
entire 
brain-
process 
as 
its 
minimal 
fact 
on 
the 
material 
side 
it 
confronts 
other 
difficultiesalmostasbad. 


In 
the

it 
ignores

certain

By 
a

incurs 
neither

and 
on 
the

hand, 
one 
need 
not 
treat 
as 
the 
physical 
counterpart 
of 
the 
stream 
of 
consciousness 
under 
observation, 
a 
'total 



brain-activity' 
which 
is 
non-existent 
as 
a 
genuinely 
physiological 
fact. 
But, 
to 
offset 
these 
advantages, 
one 
has 
physiological 
difficulties 
and 
improbabilities. 
There

no

Andthe

physical 
theories,

The

But 
the

that 
all 
the

for

not

of

been 
that 
by

might

Not

as 
the 
'inner

of 
any

orbrain-cell, 
we 
escapethatphysiological 
improbability; 
and 
as 
its 
pulses 
of 
consciousness 
are 
unitary 
and 
integral 
affairs 
from 
the 
outset, 
we 
escape 
the 
absurdity 
of 
supposing

separatelyandthen'fusetogether'bythemselves.Theseparatenessisinthebrain-world,onthistheory,andtheunityinthesoul-world;andtheonly

confess, 
therefore, 
that 
to 
posit

In

accordingly, 
we 
must 
return 
to 
its

again,andaskourselveswhether,afterall,theascertainmentofablankunmediatedcorrespondence,termforterm,ofthesuccessionofstatesofconsciousness

Oddly 
enough, 
Mr.

seems 
quite 
unaware 
of

Spencer, 
however, 
will 
have 
it 
(e.g. 
First 
Principles, 
§ 
71) 
that 
consciousness 
is 
only 
the 
occasional 
result 
of 
the 
'transformation' 
of 
a 
certainamountof'physicalforce'towhichitis'equivalent.'Presumably 
abrainmustalreadybetherebeforeanysuch'transformation'cantake

and 
so 
the

stands

The 
Relations 
Of 
Minds 
To 
Other 
Things. 


Since,forpsychology,amindisanobjectinaworldofotherobjects,
itsrelationtothoseotherobjectsmustnextbesurveyed.Firstofall,to 
its 


Time-Relations. 


Minds, 
as 
we 
know 
them, 
are 
temporary 
existences. 
Whether 
mymindhadabeingpriortothebirthofmybody,whetheritshallhaveoneafter 
the 
latter's 
decease, 
are 
questions 
to 
be 
decided 
by 
my 
general 
philosophyortheologyratherthanbywhat 
wecall 
'scientificfacts'-I 
leave 
out 
the 
facts 
of 
so-called 
spiritualism, 
as 
being 
still 
in 
dispute. 
Psychology, 
as 
a 
natural 
science, 
confines 
itself 
to 
the 
present 
life, 
in 
which 
every 
mind 
appears 
yoked 
to 
a 
body 
through 
which 
its 
manifestations 
appear. 
In 
the 
present 
world, 
then, 
minds 
precede,
succeed,andcoexistwitheachotherinthecommonreceptacleoftime,
andoftheircollectiverelationstothelatternothingmorecanbesaid.
Thelifeoftheindividualconsciousnessintimeseems,however,tobeaninterruptedone,sothatthequestion: 


Areweeverwhollyunconscious? 


becomes 
one 
which 
must 
be 
discussed. 
Sleep, 
fainting, 
coma, 
epilepsy,andother'unconscious'conditionsareapttobreakinuponand 
occupy 
large 
durations 
of 
what 
we 
nevertheless 
consider 
the 
mental 
historyofasingleman.And,thefactofinterruptionbeingadmitted,isit 
not 
possible 
that 
it 
may 
exist 
where 
we 
do 
not 
suspect 
it, 
and 
even 
perhapsinanincessantandfine-grainedform? 


This 
might 
happen, 
and 
yet 
the 
subject 
himself 
never 
know 
it. 
We 
oftentakeetherandhaveoperationsperformedwithoutasuspicionthatourconsciousnesshassufferedabreach. 
Thetwoendsjoineachothersmoothlyoverthegap;andonlythesightofourwoundassuresusthat 
we 
must 
have

which

Wethinkwehavehadnonap,andittakestheclocktoassureusthatwearewrong.1Wethusmaylivethrougharealoutwardtime,atimeknownbythepsychologistwhostudiesus,andyetnotfeelthetime,orinferitfromanyinwardsign. 
The 
questionis, 
howoftendoesthishappen?Is 
consciousness 
really 
discontinuous, 
incessantly 
interrupted 
and 
recommencing(fromthepsychologist'spointofview)?anddoesitonly

to 
itself 
by 
an 
illusion 
analogous 
to 
that 
of 
the 
zoetrope?Orisitatmosttimesascontinuousoutwardlyasitinwardlyseems? 


It 
must 
be 
confessed 
that 
we 
can 
give 
no 
rigorous 
answer 
to 
this 
question.Cartesians,whoholdthattheessenceofthesoulistothink,canof 
course 
solve 
it

M. 
Jouffroy 
and 
Sir 
W. 
Hamilton, 
attacking 
the 
question 
in 
the 
same 
empiricalway, 
areledtoanoppositeconclusion. 
Theirreasons,briefly 
stated,arethese: 


Insomnambulism,naturalorinduced,thereisoftenagreatdisplayofintellectual 
activity, 
followed 
by 
complete 
oblivion 
of 
all 
that 
has 
passed.2 


On 
being 
suddenly 
awakened 
from 
a 
sleep, 
however 
profound, 
we 
always 
catch 
ourselvesinthe 
middle 
ofa 
dream. 
Common 
dreamsare 
oftenrememberedforafewminutesafterwaking,andthenirretrievablylost. 


Frequently, 
when 
awake 
and 
absent-minded, 
we 
are 
visited 
by 
thoughtsandimageswhichthenextinstantwecannotrecall. 



Ourinsensibilitytohabitualnoises,etc.,whilstawake,provesthatwe 
can 
neglect 
to 
attend 
to 
that 
which 
we 
nevertheless 
feel. 
Similarly 
in 
sleep, 
we 
grow 
inured, 
and 
sleep 
soundly 
in 
presence 
of 
sensations 
of 
sound,cold,contact,etc.,whichatfirstpreventedourcompleterepose.
We 
have 
learned 
to 
neglect 
them 
whilst 
asleep 
as 
we 
should 
whilst 
awake.Themeresense-impressionsarethesamewhenthesleepisdeepaswhenitislight;thedifferencemustlieinajudgmentonthepartoftheapparentlyslumberingmindthattheyarenotworthnoticing. 


This

How 
can 
this

of

(more 
accurate 
often 
than 
anything 
the 
waking 
consciousness 
shows)

or 
the 
field 
is 
contracted. 
Hearing, 
taste, 
smell 
may 
similarly 
disappear, 
in 
part 
or 
in 
totality. 
Still 
more 
striking 
are 
the 
cutaneous 
anaesthesias.Theoldwitch-finderslookingforthe'devil'sseals'learned

on 
the 
patient's 
mind 
('expectant

or 
'suggestion') 
is 
still 
a 
mooted 
question. 
A 
still 
better 
awakener 
of 
sensibility 
is 
the 
hypnotictrance,intowhichmanyofthesepatientscanbeveryeasilyplaced,andinwhichtheirlostsensibilitynotinfrequentlybecomesentirelyrestored.
Such 
returns 
of 
sensibility 
succeed 
the 
times 
of 
insensibility 
and 
alternatewiththem.ButMessrs.PierreJanet4andA.Binet5haveshown 
thatduringthetimesofanaesthesia,andcoexistingwithit,sensibilitytothe 
anaesthetic 
parts 
is 
also 
there, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
secondary 
consciousness 
entirely 
cut 
off 
from 
the 
primary 
or 
normal 
one, 
but 
susceptibleofbeingtappedandmadetotestifytoitsexistenceinvariousoddways. 


ChiefamongsttheseiswhatM.Janetcalls'themethodofdistraction.' 
Thesehystericsareapttopossessaverynarrowfieldofattention,andtobeunabletothinkofmorethanonethingatatime.Whentalkingwith

without

When 
finally 
she

Now 
M. 
Janet 
found 
in 
several 
subjects 
like 
this 
that 
if 
he 
came 
up 
behind 
them 
whilst 
they 
were 
plunged 
in 
conversation 
with 
a 
third 
party,andaddressedtheminawhisper,tellingthemtoraisetheirhandorperformothersimpleacts,theywouldobeytheordergiven,althoughtheirtalkingintelligencewasquiteunconsciousofreceivingit. 
Leading 
them 
from

to 
his 
whisperedquestions,andfinallymadethemanswerinwriting,ifapencilwereplacedintheirhand.Theprimaryconsciousnessmeanwhilewentonwiththeconversation,entirelyunawareoftheseperformancesonthehand's

The 
consciousness 
which 
presided 
over 
these 
latter 
appeared 
in 
its 
turn 
to 
be 
quite 
as 
little 
disturbed 
by 
the 
upper 
consciousness's 
concerns.

The 
primary

so 
to 
call 
it, 
is 
meanwhile 
unable 
to 
say 
whether

no

the

of

Léonie, 
who 
sees

and 
stops 
stupefied: 
'Why,' 
says 
she, 
'I 
have 
an 
eyeglass 
in

M. 
Binet 
found 
a 
very 
curious 
sort 
of 
connection 
between 
the 
apparently 
anaesthetic 
skin 
and 
the 
mind 
in 
someSalpétrière-subjects.

In 
certain 
individuals 
there 
was 
found 
a 
still 
odder 
phenomenon, 
which 
reminds 
one 
of 
that 
curious 
idiosyncrasy 
of 
'colored 
hearing' 
of 
whichafewcaseshavebeenlatelydescribedwithgreatcarebyforeignwriters. 
Theseindividuals, 
namely,sawtheimpressionreceivedbythe 
hand, 
but 
could 
not 
feel 
it; 
and 
the 
thing 
seen 
appeared 
by 
no 
means 
associated 
with 
the 
hand, 
but 
more 
like 
an 
independent 
vision, 
which 
usuallyinterestedandsurprisedthepatient.Herhandbeinghiddenbyascreen,shewasorderedtolookatanotherscreenandtotellofanyvisualimage

tosimilaronestracedonthepalm;thehanditselforitsfingerswouldcomewhenmanipulated;andfinallyobjectsplacedinitwouldcome;butonthe 
hand 
itself 
nothing 
would 
ever 
be 
felt. 
Of 
course 
simulation 
would 
not 
be 
hard 
here; 
but 
M. 
Binet 
disbelieves 
this 
(usually 
very 
shallow) 
explanationtobeaprobableoneincasesinquestion.6 


Theusualwayinwhichdoctorsmeasurethedelicacyofourtouchisby

M. 
Binet, 
M. 
Pierre 
Janet, 
and 
M. 
Jules 
Janet 
have 
all 
found 
this. 
The

asaccuratelyasifshewereanormalperson.Shewouldsignifyitonlyby 

these 
movements; 
and 
of 
the

themselves 
her 
primary 
self 
would 
be 
as 
unconscious 
as 
of 
the 
facts 
they 
signified, 
for 
what 
the

from 
hysterical 
disease, 
the 
method 
of 
automatic 
writing 
proves 
that 
their 
perceptions 
exist, 
only 
cut 
off 
from 
communication 
with 
the 
upper 
consciousness. 
M. 
Binet 
has 
found 
the 
hand 
of 
his 
patients 
unconsciously 
writing 
down 
words 
which 
their 
eyes 
were 
vainly 
endeavoring 
to 
'see,' 
i.e., 
to 
bring 
to 
the 
upper 
consciousness. 
Their 
submergedconsciousnesswasofcourseseeingthem,orthehandcouldnot 
have 
written 
as 
it

It 
must 
be 
admitted, 
therefore, 
that 
in 
certain 
persons, 
at 
least, 
the 
total 
possible 
consciousness 
may 
be 
split 
into 
parts 
which

but

Barring 
a

common 
fund 
of 
information, 
like 
the 
commandoflanguage,etc.,whattheupperselfknowstheunderselfisignorant 
of, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
M. 
Janet 
has 
proved 
this 
beautifully 
in 
his 
subjectLucie.Thefollowingexperimentwillserveasthetypeoftherest:
Inhertrancehecoveredherlapwithcards,eachbearinganumber.He 
thentoldherthatonwakingsheshouldnotseeanycardwhosenumber

a

This 
is 
the 
ordinary 
so-called 
'post-hypnotic 
suggestion,' 
now 
well 
known, 
and 
for 
which 
Lucie 
was 
a 
well-adapted 
subject. 
Accordingly, 
when 
she 
was 
awakened 
and 
asked 
about 
the 
papers 
on 
her 
lap, 
she 
counted 
and 
said 
she 
saw 
those 
only 
whose

the

when

Similarly 
when

the 
fact

Sometimes 
the 
mutual 
ignorance 
of 
the 
selves 
leads 
to 
incidents 
which 
are 
strange 
enough. 
The 
acts 
and

performed

are 
withdrawn

Such

incredible, 
until

has 
seen 
their

Long 
ago, 
without 
understanding 
it, 
I 
myself 
saw 
a 
small

of 
the

theburiedselfoftencomestothesurfaceanddrivesouttheotherself

In

about

of 
an

being

throughout 
a 
certain 
amount 
of

We 
must 
distinguishthekindsofpresence.Insomemannerourconsciousnessis 
'present' 
to 
everything 
with 
which 
it 
is 
in 
relation. 
I

If, 
then, 
by 
the 
seat 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
meant 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
locality 
with 
which 
it 
stands 
in 
immediate 
dynamic 
relations, 
we 
are 
certain 
to 
be 
right 
in 
saying 
that 
its 
seat 
is 
somewhere 
in 
the 
cortex 
of 
the 
brain. 
Descartes, 
as 
is 
well 
known,
thoughtthattheinextendedsoulwasimmediatelypresenttothepinealgland. 
Others, 
as 
Lotze 
in 
his 
earlier 
days, 
and 
W. 
Volkmann, 
think 
its 
position 
must 
be 
at 
some 
point 
of 
the 
structureless 
matrix

These

remind 
us 
of

Plato 
gave 
head,

to 
the 
immortal 
reason, 
the 
courage, 
and 
the 
appetites,

their

Now 
the 
relation 
of 
knowing 
is 
the 
most 
mysterious 
thing 
in 
the 
world. 
If 
we 
ask 
how 
one 
thing 
can 
know 
another 
we 
are 
led 
into 
the 
heart 
of 
Erkenntnisstheorie 
and 
metaphysics.

for 
his 
part,doesnotconsiderthemattersocuriouslyasthis.Findingaworld

believes 
to 
be 
that 
same 
world; 
he 
cannot 
but 
conclude 
that 
thoseotherthoughtsknowitaftertheirfashionevenasheknowsitafterhis. 
Knowledge 
becomes 
for 
him 
an 
ultimate 
relation 
that 
must 
be 



admitted, 
whether 
it 
be 
explained 
or 
not, 
just 
like 
difference 
or

however, 
can 
be 
judged 
in 
a 
different 
way, 
because 
the

himself 
can

and 
though 
his 
knowledge 
is

But 
even 
in 
mere 
sense-impression 
the 
duplication 
of 
the 
object 
by 
an 
inner 
construction 
must 
take 
place. 
Consider, 
with 
Professor 
Bowne, 
what 
happens 
when 
two 
people 
conversetogetherandknoweachother'smind. 


"No

This:

There 
are 
two 
kinds 
of 
knowledge 
broadly 
and 
practically 
distinguishable: 
we 
may 
call 
them 
respectively 
knowledge 
of 
acquaintance 
and 
knowledge-about. 
Most

express 
the 
distinction;thus,gnvnai,eidenai;noscere,scire;kennen,wissen;

but 
about 
the

what 
respect 
distance 
is 
just 
what 
it 
is, 
and 
differs 
from

At

I

to

Go

The 
Stream 
of 
Thought. 


Wenowbeginourstudyofthemindfromwithin. 
Mostbooksstart 
withsensations,asthesimplestmentalfacts,andproceedsynthetically,
constructing 
each 
higher 
stage 
from 
those 
below 
it. 
But 
this 
is 
abandoning 
the 
empirical 
method 
of 
investigation. 
No 
one 
ever 
had 
a 
simple 
sensation 
by 
itself. 
Consciousness, 
from 
our 
natal 
day, 
is 
of 
a 
teeming 
multiplicity 
of 
objects 
and 
relations, 
and 
what 
we 
call 
simplesensationsareresultsofdiscriminativeattention,pushedoftentoaveryhigh 
degree. 
It 
is 
astonishing 
what 
havoc 
is 
wrought 
in 
psychology 
by 
admitting 
at 
the 
outset 
apparently 
innocent 
suppositions, 
that 
neverthelesscontainaflaw. 
Thebadconsequencesdevelopthemselveslateron,andareirremediable,beingwoventhroughthewholetextureofthework.Thenotionthatsensations,beingthesimplestthings,arethefirst 
things 
to 
take 
up 
in 
psychology 
is 
one 
of 
these 
suppositions. 
The 
onlythingwhichpsychologyhasarighttopostulateattheoutsetisthefact 
of 
thinking 
itself, 
and 
that 
must 
first 
be 
taken 
up 
and 
analyzed. 
If 
sensations 
then 
prove 
to 
be 
amongst 
the 
elements 
of 
the 
thinking, 
we 
shall 
be 
no 
worse 
off 
as 
respects 
them 
than 
if 
we 
had 
taken 
them 
for

In

Each 
of 
these 
minds 
keeps 
its 
own 
thoughts 
to 
itself. 
There 
is 
no 
giving 
or 
bartering 
between 
them. 
No 
thought 
even 
comes 
into 
direct 
sight 
of 
a 
thought 
in 
another 
personal 
consciousness 
than 
its 
own.

Everyone 
will 
recognize 
this 
to 
be 
true, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
existence 
of 
something 
corresponding 
to 
the 
term 
'personalmind'isallthatisinsistedon,withoutanyparticularviewofitsnaturebeing

On 
thesetermsthe 
personal 
self 
rather 
thanthe 
thought 
might 
be 
treated 
as 
the 
immediate 
datum 
in 
psychology. 
The 
universalconsciousfactisnot'feelingsandthoughtsexist,'but'Ithink' 
and 
'I 
feel.'2 
No 
psychology, 
at 
any 
rate, 
can 
question 
the 
existence 
of 
personal 
selves. 
The 
worst 
a 
psychology 
can 
do 
is 
so 
to 
interpret 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
selves 
as 
to 
rob 
them 
of 
their 
worth. 
A 
French 
writer, 
speaking 
of 
our 
ideas, 
says 
somewhere 
in 
a 
fit 
of 
anti-spiritualisticexcitementthat,misledbycertainpeculiarititieswhichtheydisplay,we'end 
by 
personifying' 
the 
procession 
which 
they 
make, 
-such 
personificationbeingregardedbyhimasagreatphilosophicblunderon 
our 
part. 
It 
could 
only 
be 
a 
blunder 
if 
the 
notion 
of 
personality 
meant 
somethingessentiallydifferentfromanythingtobefoundinthementalprocession.Butifthatprocessionbeitselfthevery'original'ofthenotion 
of 
personality, 
to 
personify 
it 
cannot 
possibly 
be 
wrong. 
It 
is 
already 
personified. 
There 
are 
no

According 
to 
M. 
Janet 
these 
secondary

are 
always 
abnormal,

are 
the 
work 
of 
an 
inferior

natural 
mind, 
set 
free 
from

the

working

a

To 
these 
indirect 
presumptions 
that 
our 
sensations, 
following 
the 
mutationsofourcapacityforfeeling,arealwaysundergoinganessentialchange, 
must 
be 
added 
another 
presumption, 
based 
on 
what 
must 
happen 
in 
the 
brain. 
Every 
sensation 
corresponds 
to 
some 
cerebral 
action. 
For 
an 
identical 
sensation 
to 
recur 
it 
would 
have 
to 
occur 
the 
second 
time 
in 
an 
unmodified 
brain. 
But 
as 
this, 
strictly 
speaking, 
is 
a 
physiologicalimpossibility,soisanunmodifiedfeelinganimpossibility;
for 
to 
every 
brain-modification, 
however 
small, 
must 
correspond 
a 
changeofequalamountinthefeelingwhichthebrainsubserves. 


Allthiswouldbetrueifevensensationscametouspureandsingleandnotcombinedinto'things.'Eventhenweshouldhavetoconfessthat, 
however 
we 
might 
in 
ordinary 
conversation 
speak 
of 
getting 
the 
same 



sensation 
again, 
wenever 
in 
strict 
theoreticaccuracy 
could 
do 
so;and 
that 
whatever 
was 
true 
of 
the 
river 
of 
life, 
of 
the 
river 
of 
elementary 
feeling, 
itwouldcertainlybetruetosay, 
likeHeraclitus, 
thatwenever 
descendtwiceintothesamestream. 


But 
if 
the 
assumption 
of 
'simple 
ideas 
of 
sensation' 
recurring 
in 
immutable 
shape 
is 
so 
easily 
shown 
to 
be 
baseless, 
how 
much 
more 
baseless 
is 
the 
assumption 
of 
immutability 
in 
thelarger 
masses 
of 
our 
thought! 


Forthereitisobviousandpalpablethatourstateofmindisneverprecisely 
the

Every 
thought 
we 
have

different 
angle,

And 
the 
thought 
by 
which 
we 
cognize 
it 
is 
the 
thought 
of 
it-in-thoserelations, 
a 
thought 
suffused 
with 
the

Allweknowof

to 
show

brain 
are 



physiologically 
ineffective, 
and 
that 
presumably 
none 
are

But 
as 
the 
brain-tension 
shifts 
from

is 
it

If 
anything 
seems 
obscure 
about 
it, 
it 
will 
grow 
clearer 
as 
we 
advance. 
Meanwhile, 
if 
it

true, 
it 
is 
certainly 
also 
true 
that 
no

The 
proposition 
is 
more 
important 
theoretically 
than 
it 
at 
first 
sight 
seems. 
For 
it 
makes 
it 
already 
impossible 
for 
us 
to 
follow 
obediently 
in 
the 
footprints 
of 
either 
the 
Lockian

the

What 
makes 
it 
convenient 
to 
use 
the 
mythological

is 
the

Within 
each 
personal 
consciousness, 
thought 
is 
sensibly 
continuous.

that 
the

that

had 
no 
connection 
whatever 
with 
the 
one 
that

The 
proposition 
that

1.Thatevenwherethereisatime-gaptheconsciousnessafteritfeels

2.Thatthechangesfromonemomenttoanotherinthequalityoftheconsciousnessareneverabsolutelyabrupt. 


The 
caseofthe 
time-gaps, 
as 
the 
simplest, 
shall 
be 
taken 
first. 
And

Onpage200wesawthatsuchtime-gapsexisted,andthattheymightbemorenumerousthanisusuallysupposed.Iftheconsciousnessisnot 
aware 
of

it 
cannot 
feel 
them 
as

In 
the 
unconsciousness 
produced 
by 
nitrous 
oxide 
and 
other 
anæsthetics, 
in 
thatofepilepsyandfainting, 
thebrokenedgesofthe

meet

With 
the 
felt

the 
case 
is 
different. 
On 
waking 
from 
sleep, 
we 
usually 
know 
that 
we 
have 
been 
unconscious, 
and 
we 
often 
have 
an 
accurate 
judgment 
of 
how

The 
judgment 
here 
is 
certainly 
an

This

is 
based 
partly 
on 
a 
confusion 
and 
partly 
on 
a 
superficialintrospectiveview.

quite

The 
commonest 
modifications 
in 
sense-perception 
are 
known 
as 
the 
phenomenaofcontrast.

are 
the

But 
whatever

it 
seems 
impossible 
that 
it

not

that 
they

the

The

objects, 
we 
call 
'sensations'or'images,' 


according 
as 
they

vivid

of 
complex

'thoughts'whenfaint.Forthe 
swiftconsciousnesseswehaveonlythosenamesof'transitivestates,'or 
'feelings

As

continuous, 
so 
do 
all 
these

melt

some

the

as

Emphasis 
of

almost 
altogether 
a 
matter 
of 
grammatical 
construction.

Now 
what

is 
that 
'tendencies' 
are 
not 
only 
descriptions

but 
that 
they 
are 
among 
the 
objects 
of 
the

which 
is 
thus 
aware 
of

from

these

enough.Whatmustbeadmittedisthatthedefiniteimagesoftraditionalpsychologyformbuttheverysmallestpartofourmindsastheyactuallylive. 
The 
traditional 
psychology

like 
one 
who 
should 
say

consists 
of 
nothing 
but

It 
is 
just 
this

of

that 



psychologists

The

The

Again, 
when 
we

noun, 
such

in 
a 
universal 
sense,assignifyingallpossiblemen,wearefullyawareofthisintention

from 
our

or 
asolitary 
individual

Inthe 
chapter 
on 
Conception 
we 
shall 
see 
how 
important 
this 
difference 
of 
intention 
is. 
It 
casts 
its 
influence 
over 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
sentence, 
both 
before 
and 
after 
the 
spot 
in 
which 
the 
word 
man 
is 
used. 
Nothing

Justas 
theechoofthewhence,the 


sense 
of 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
our 
thought, 
is 
probably 
due 
to 
the 
dying 
excitement 
of 
processes 
but 
a 
moment 
since 
vividly 
aroused; 
so 
thesenseofthewhither,thefore-tasteoftheterminus,mustbeduetothe

or

which, 
a

the

correlatives 
of 
some 
thing 
which 
a

will 
be 
vividly 
present 
to 
the

The 
chapter 
is 
entitled 
"What 
is 
the 
cause 
that 
nonsense 
so 
often 
escapes 
being 
detected, 
both 
by 
the 
writer 
and 
by 
the 
reader?" 
The 
author, 
in 
answering 
this 
question, 
makes 
(inter 
alia) 
the 
following 
remarks:21 
"Thatconnection[hesays]orrelationwhichcomesgraduallytosubsistamong 
the 
different 
words 
of

in

of

Itmay,inlikemanner,beadmittedasanaxiominpsychologythatideasassociatedbythe

idea 
will 
associate 
one

Hence 
it 
will 
happen 
that 
if, 
from 
experiencing 
the 
connection 
of 
two 
things, 
there 
results, 
as 
infalliblytherewill 
result, 
anassociationbetweentheideasornotions 



annexedtothem, 
aseachideawillmoreoverbeassociated 
byitssign, 
there 
will 
likewise 
be 
an 
association 
between 
the 
ideas 
of 
the 
signs. 
Hence 
the 
sounds 
considered 
as 
signs 
will 
be 
conceived 
to 
have 
a 
connection 
analogous 
to 
that 
which 
subsisteth 
among 
the 
things 
signified; 
I 
say, 
the 
sounds 
considered 
as 
signs; 
for 
this 
way 
of 
consideringthemconstantlyattendsusinspeaking,writing,hearing,andreading.Whenwepurposelyabstractfromit,andregardthemmerelyas 
sounds, 
weareinstantlysensiblethattheyarequiteunconnected, 
and 
have 
no 
other 
relation 
than 
what 
ariseth 
from 
similitude 
of 
tone 
or 
accent. 
But 
to 
consider 
them 
in 
this 
manner 
commonly 
results 
from 
previousdesign,andrequiresakindofeffortwhichisnotexertedintheordinaryuseofspeech.Inordinaryusetheyareregardedsolelyassigns, 
or, 
rather, 
they

"Now 
this

Byreiteratedrecoursetothismedium,ifnecessarilyhappensthatwhenthings 
are 
related 
to 
each 
other, 
the 
words 
signifying 
those 
things 
are 
more 
commonly 
brought 
together 
in 
discourse. 
Hence 
the 
words 
and 
names 
by 
themselves, 
by 
customary 
vicinity, 
contract 
in 
the 
fancy 
a 
relation 
additional 
to 
that 
which 
they 
derive 
purely 
from

as 
far 
as 
hath 
yet

are 
of 
a 
regular

analogical 
make. 
The 
consequence 
is 
that 
similar 
relations 
in 
things 
will 
be 
expressed 
similarly; 
that 
is, 
by 
similar 
inflections, 
derivations, 
compositions, 
arrangement 
of 
words, 
or 
juxtaposition 
of 
particles, 
according 
to 
the 
genius 
or 
grammatical 
form 
of 
the 
particular 
tongue. 
Now 
as, 
by 
the 
habitualuseofalanguage(eventhoughitwerequiteirregular),thesignswould 
insensibly 
become

certain

stand 
for 
a 
good 
part 
of 
our

that

Each

a

when

is 
abstract, 
as 
'criminal

'fallacy,' 
the 
meaning

of

the 
so-called

But

For 
Absolute 
Idealism, 
the 
infinite 
Thought 
and 
its 
objects 
are 
one. 



The 
0bjects 
are, 
through 
being

the 
eternal 
Mind 
is, 
through 
thinkingthem.Wereahumanthoughtaloneintheworldtherewouldbenoreasonforanyotherassumptionregardingit.Whateveritmighthavebeforeitwouldbeitsvision,wouldbethere,inits'there,'orthen,inits

and 
the 
question 
would 
never 
arise 
whether 
an 
extra-mental 
duplicate 
of 
it 
existed 
or 
not. 
The 
reason 
why 
we 
all 
believe 
that 
the 
objectsofourthoughtshaveaduplicateexistenceoutside,isthattherearemanyhumanthoughts,eachwiththesameobjects,aswecannothelpsupposing. 
The 
judgment

as

In 
Chapter

we 
shall 
have 
to 
take 
up 
the 
judgment 
of 
samenessagain.Toshowthatthequestionofrealitybeingextra-mentalornotisnotlikelytoariseintheabsenceofrepeatedexperiencesofthesame,taketheexampleofanaltogetherunprecedentedexperience,such

or 
an 
objectivequalityfelt?Youdonotevenaskthequestionatthispoint.Itis 
simply 
that 
taste. 
But 
if 
a 
doctor 
hears 
you 
describe 
it, 
and 
says: 
"Ha! 
Now 
you 
know 
what 
heartburn 
is," 
then 
it 
becomes 
a 
quality 
already 
existent 
extra

which 
you 
in

"During

the

Dr. 
Shoemaker 
of 
Philadelphia 
describes 
during 
the 
deepest 
consciousstageofether-intoxicationavisionof 


"two 
endless 
parallel

orthatthereexistedanysuchthingassuchabeing;thelinesandwaveswereall."30 


Similarly 
a 
friend 
of 
Mr. 
Herbert 
Spencer, 
quoted 
by 
him 
in 
'Mind' 
(vol. 
III. 
p. 
556), 
speaks 
of 
"an 
undisturbed 
empty 
quiet 
everywhereexceptthatastupidpresencelaylikeaheavyintrusionsomewhere 
-a 
blotch 
on 
the 
calm." 
This 
sense 
of 
objectivity 
and 
lapse 
of 
subjectivity, 
even 
when 
the 
object 
is 
almost 
indefinable, 
is, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
a 
somewhatfamiliarphaseinchloroformization,thoughinmyowncaseitis 
too 
deep 
a 
phase 
for 
any 
articulate 
after-memory 
to 
remain. 
I 
onlyknowthatasitvanishesIseemtowaketoasenseofmyownexistenceassomethingadditionaltowhathadpreviouslybeenthere.31 


Manyphilosophers, 
however, 
hold 
that 
thereflectiveconsciousness 
oftheselfisessentialtothecognitive 



function 
of 
thought. 
They 
hold 
that 
a 
thought, 
in 
order 
to 
know 
a 
thing 
at 
all, 
must 
expressly 
distinguish 
between 
the 
thing 
and 
its 
own 
self.32 
This 
is 
a 
perfectly 
wanton 
assumption, 
and 
not 
the 
faintest 
shadow 
ofreasonexists 
forsupposingit 
true. 
Aswellmight 
I 
contend 
that 
I 
cannot 
dream 
without 
dreaming 
that 
I 
dream, 
swear 
without 
swearingthatIswear,denywithoutdenyingthatIdeny,asmaintainthatI 
cannot 
know 
without 
knowing 
that 
I 
know. 
I 
may 
have 
either 
acquaintance-with,orknowledge-about,anobjectOwithoutthinkaboutmyself 
at 
all. 
It 
suffices 
for 
this 
that 
I 
think 
O, 
and 
that 
it 
exist. 
If, 
in 
additiontothinkingO,IalsothinkthatIexistandthatIknowO,wellandgood;Ithenknowonemorething,afactaboutofwhichIpreviouslywasunmindful. 
That, 
however, 
does 
not 
prevent 
me 
from 
having 
already 
known 
it 
a 
good 
deal. 
O 
per 
se, 
or 
O 
plus 
P, 
are 
as 
good 
objects 
of 
knowledge 
as 
O 
plus 
me 
is. 
The 
philosophers 
in 
question 
simply 
substituteoneparticularobjectforallothers, 
andcallittheobjectpar 
excellence. 
It 
is 
a 
case 
of 
the 
'psychologist's 
fallacy' 
(see 
p. 
197). 
They 
know 
the 
object 
to 
be 
one 
thing 
and 
the 
thought 
another; 
and 
they 
forthwith 
foist 
their 
own 
knowledge 
into 
that 
of 
the 
thought 
of 
which 
theypretendtogiveatrueaccount.Toconclude,then,thoughtmay,butneednot,inknowing,discriminatebetweenitsobjectanditself. 


Wehavebeen 
usingthe 
wordObject. 
Somethingmustnow 
be 
said 
abouttheproperuseoftheterminPsychology. 


In 
popular 
parlance 
the 
word 
object 
is 
commonly 
taken 
without 
reference 
to 
the 
act 
of 
knowledge, 
and 
treated 
as 
synonymous 
with 
individual 
subject 
of 
existence. 
Thus 
if 
anyone 
ask 
what 
is 
the 
mind's 
object 
when 
you 
say 
'Columbus 
discovered 
America 
in 
1492,' 
most 
peoplewillreply'Columbus,'or'America,'or,atmost,'thediscoveryof 
America.' 
They 
will 
name 
a 
substantive 
kernel 
or 
nucleus 
of 
the 
consciousness,andsaythethoughtis'about'that,-asindeeditis,-and 
theywillcallthatyourthought's'object.'Reallythatisusuallyonlythe 
grammatical 
object, 
or 
more 
likely 
the 
grammatical 
subject, 
of 
your 
sentence. 
It 
is 
at 
most 
your 
'fractional 
object;' 
or 
you 
may 
call 
it 
the 
'topic'ofyourthought,orthe'subjectofyourdiscourse.'ButtheObjectofyourthoughtisreallyitsentirecontentordeliverance,neithermorenorless.Itisavicioususeofspeechtotakeoutasubstantivekernelfrom 



its 
content 
and 
call 
that 
its

and 
it 
is 
an 
equally 
vicious 
use 
of 
speech 
to 
add 
a 
substantive 
kernel 
not 
articulately 
included 
in 
its 
content, 
and 
to 
callthatitsobject. 
Yeteitheroneofthesetwosinswe 
commit,wheneverwecontentourselveswithsayingthatagiventhoughtis 
simply 
'about' 
a 
certain 
topic, 
or 
that 
that 
topic 
is 
its 
'object.' 
The 
object 
of 
my 
thought 
in 
the 
previous 
sentence, 
for 
example, 
is 
strictly 
speakingneitherColumbus,norAmerica,noritsdiscovery.Itisnothing 
shortoftheentiresentence,'Columbus

And 
if 
we 
wish 
to 
speak 
of 
it 
substantively, 
we 
must 
make 
a 
substantive 
of 
it

Ourpsychologicaldutyistoclingascloselyaspossibletotheactualconstitution

We

That 
is,

Thus,

psychologist 
would 
not 
hesitate 
to

that

True,

ButforthemomentitisnotfullyandimmediatelyColumbus,itisonly'he,'

The

of

then, 
is 
neither

than 
all

As 
Thomas 
Brownsays:33 


"I 
have 
already 
spoken 
too 
often 
to 
require 
again 
to 
caution 
you 
against 
the 
mistake 
into 
which, 
I 
confess, 
that 
the 
terms 
which 
the 
poverty 
of 
our 
language 
obliges 
us 
to 
use 
might 
of 
themselves 
very 
naturally 
lead 
you; 
the 
mistake 
of 
supposing 
that 
the 
most 
complex 
states 
of 
mind 
are 
not 
truly, 
in 
their 
very 
essence, 
as 
much 
one 
and 
indivisibleasthosewhichwetermsimple-thecomplexityandseemingcoexistencewhichtheyinvolvebeingrelativetoourfeeling34only,notto 
their 
own 
absolute 
nature. 
I 
trust 
I 
need 
not 
repeat 
to 
you 
that, 
in 
itself, 
every 
notion, 
however 
seemingly 
complex, 
is, 
and 
must 
be, 
truly 
simple-beingonestateoraffection,ofonesimplesubstance,mind.Our 
conception 
of 
a 
whole

for 
example, 
is 
as 
truly 
this 
one 
mind 
existinginthisonestate,asourconceptionofanyoftheindividualsthatcomposeanarmy.Ournotionoftheabstractnumbers,eight,four,two,isastrulyonefeelingofthemindasournotionofsimpleunity." 


The 
ordinary 
associationist-psychology 
supposes, 
in 
contrast 
with 
this, 
that 
whenever 
an 
object 
of 
thought 
contains 
many 
elements, 
the 
thoughtitselfmustbemadeupofjustasmanyideas,oneideaforeachelement,andallfusedtogetherinappearance,butreallyseparate.35Theenemiesofthispsychologyfind(aswehavealreadyseen)littletroubleinshowingthatsuchabundleofseparateideaswouldneverformonethoughtatall,andtheycontendthatanEgomustbeaddedtothebundleto 
give 
it 
unity, 
and 
bring 
the 
various 
ideas 
into 
relation 
with 
each 
other.36 
We 
will 
not 
discuss 
the 
ego 
just 
yet, 
but 
it 
is 
obvious 
that

If

Nowmostbelieversintheego 
make 
the 
same 
mistake 
as 
the 
associationists 
and 
sensationists 
whom 



theyoppose. 
Bothagreethattheelementsofthesubjectivestreamare 
discrete 
and 
separate 
and 
constitute 
what 
Kant 
calls 
a 
'manifold.' 
But 
while 
the 
associationists 
think 
that 
a 
'manifold' 
can 
form 
a 
singleknowledge,theegoistsdenythis,andsaythattheknowledgecomesonlywhen 
the 
manifold 
is 
subjected 
to 
the 
synthetizing 
activity 
of 
an 
ego.
Bothmakeanidenticalinitialhypothesis;buttheegoist,findingitwon't 
express 
the 
facts, 
adds 
another 
hypothesis 
to 
correct 
it.

Thislatterauthorseemstometohavekeptatmuchcloserquarterswith 
the

than 
any 
other 
analyst 
of 
consciousness.38 
But 
even 
he 
doesnotquitehitthemark,for,asIunderstandhim,hethinksthateachwordasit 


occupies 
the 
mind 
displaces 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
thought's 
content. 
He 
distinguishesthe'idea'(whatIhavecalledthetotal 


objectormeaning)fromtheconsciousnessofthewords,callingtheformeraveryfeeblestate,andcontrastingit 


with 
the 
liveliness 
of 
the 
words, 
even 
when 
these 
are 
only 
silently 
rehearsed. 
"The 
feeling," 
he 
says, 
"of 
the 
words 
makes 
ten 
or 
twenty 
times 
more 
noise 
in 
our 
consciousness 
than 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
phrase, 
which 
for 
consciousness 
is 
a 
very 
slight 
matter."39 
And 
having 
distinguished 
these 
two 
things, 
he 
goes 
on 
to 
separate 
them 
in 
time,
sayingthattheideamayeitherprecedeorfollowthewords,butthatitis 
a'pureillusion'tosupposethemsimultaneous.40NowIbelievethatin

And 
then, 
among

we 
get 
from

A

Social

is 
the

Properly 
speaking, 
a

To

to

But 
as

individuals

fall 
naturally 
into 
classes, 
we 
may 
practically 
say 
that 
he 
has 
as 
many 
different 
social

as 
there 
are

The 
particular 
social 
self 
of 
a 
man 
called

honor 
is 
usually 
the 
result 
of 
one 
of 
those 
splittings 
of 
which 
we 
have 
spoken. 
It 
is 
his

in

(c) 
By 
the 
Spiritual 
Self, 
so 
far 
as 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
Empirical 
Me, 
I 
mean 
a 
man's 
inner 
or 
subjective 
being, 
his 
psychic 
faculties 
or 
dispositions,takenconcretely;notthebareprincipleofpersonalUnity, 
or 
'pure' 
Ego, 
which 
remains 
still 
to 
be 
discussed. 
These 
psychic 
dispositions 
are 
the 
most 
enduring 
and 
intimate 
part 
of 
the 
self, 
that 
whichwemostverilyseemtobe.Wetakeapurerself-satisfactionwhenwethinkofourabilitytoargueanddiscriminate,ofourmoralsensibilityandconscience,ofourindomitablewill,thanwhenwesurveyanyofourother

is 
a

insist

and 
then 
the 
spiritual

will

the 
entire

of 
our

whetherwetakeitabstractlyorconcretely,ourconsideringthespiritualself 
at 
all 
is 
a 
reflective 
process, 
is 
the 
result 
of 
our 
abandoning 
the 
outward-lookingpointofview,andofourhavingbecomeabletothinkofsubjectivityassuch,tothinkourselvesasthinkers. 


Thisattentiontothoughtassuch,andtheidentificationofourselveswith 
it 
rather 
than 
with 
any 
of 
the 
objects 
which 
it 
reveals, 
is 
a 
momentous 
and 
in 
some 
respects 
a 
rather 
mysterious 
operation, 
of 
whichweneedhereonlysaythatasamatteroffactitexists;andthatineveryone,atanearlyage,thedistinctionbetweenthoughtassuch,andwhat 
it 
is

or 
'about,' 
has

to 
the 
mind. 
The 
deeper 
grounds 
for 
this 
discrimination 
may 
possibly 
be 
hard 
to 
find; 
but

For 
this 
central 
part 
of 
the 
Self 
is 
felt. 
It 
may 
be 
all 
that 
Transcendentalists 
say 
it 
is, 
and 
all 
that 
Empiricists 
say 
it 
is 
into 
the 
bargain, 
but 
it 
is 
at 
any 
rate 
no 
mere

rationis, 
cognized 
only 
in 
an 
intellectualway,andnomeresummationofmemoriesormeresoundof

It 
is 
something 
with 
which 
we 
also 
have 
direct 
sensible 
acquaintance, 
and 
which 
is 
as 
fully 
present 
at 
any 
moment 
of 
consciousness 
in 
which 
it 
is

This

the

insteadofbeingdirectedtowardstheperiphery,seemtocomefromtheperiphery

In 
the

of

they

the 
permanent 
core 
of 
turnings-towards

seem

If

that

and 
that 
over

above 
these

there 
is 
nothing 
save 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
are

the 
fact 
of 
the

It 
is 
only 
known 
in 
subsequent

Instead, 
then, 
of 
the 
stream 
of 
thought 
being 
one

in

Each

would

be

These 
are 
primarily 
self-complacency 
and 
self-dissatisfaction. 
Of 
what 
is 
called 
'self-love,' 
I

a 
little

the

of 
the

forming 
the 
selfsatisfaction,
andthesumoftherepresentedpainsformingtheoppositefeeling

No 
doubt, 
when 
we 
are 
self-satisfied, 
we 
do 
fondly 
rehearse 
all 
possible 
rewards 
for 
our 
desert, 
and 
when

Butthemereexpectationofrewardisnotthe

3.Self-SeekingandSelf-Preservation. 


These 
words 
cover 
a 
large 
number 
of 
our 
fundamental 
instinctive 
impulses. 
We 
have 
those 
of 
bodily 
self-seeking, 
those 
of 
social 
self

as

Our

at

and 
the 
extracorporeal 
material 
selves 
and 
the 
various 
social

Our 
merely

judgments 
originally 
called 
forth 
by 
the 
acts 
of

these

to

it 
would 
be 
long

In 
each 
kind 
of 
self, 
material, 
social, 
and 
spiritual, 
men 
distinguish 
between 
the 
immediate 
and 
actual, 
and 
the 
remote 
and 
potential, 
between 
the 
narrower 
and 
the 
wider 
view, 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
the 
former 
and 
advantage 
of 
the 
latter. 
One 
must 
forego 
a 
present 
bodily 
enjoyment 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
one's 
general 
health; 
one

the

in

and 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
connection 
with 
our 
moral 
and 
religious 
life. 
When 
for 
motives 
of 
honor 
and 
conscience 
I 
brave 
the 
condemnationofmyownfamily,club,and'set';when,asaprotestant,I 
turn

as

as

I 
am

TheidealsocialselfwhichIthusseekinappealingto

that

The

of

nature 
of

Our 
decks 
are 
consequently 
cleared 
for 
the 
struggle 
with 
that 
pure 
principle 
of 
personalidentitywhichhasmetusallalongourpreliminaryexposition,
butwhichwe 
have 
always 
shied 
from 
andtreated 
asa 
difficulty 
tobe

Ever 
since

time, 
it 
has 
been 
justly 
regarded 
as 
the 
mostpuzzlingpuzzlewithwhichpsychologyhastodeal;andwhateverviewonemayespouse,onehastoholdhispositionagainstheavyodds.
If, 
with 
the 
Spiritualists, 
one 
contend 
for 
a 
substantial 
soul, 
or 
transcendental 
principle 
of 
unity, 
one 
can 
give 
no

account

whatthatmaybe. 
Andif,withtheHumians, 
onedenysuchaprincipleandsaythatthestreamofpassingthoughtsisall,onerunsagainsttheentire 
common-sense 
of 
mankind, 
of 
which 
the 
belief 
in 
a 
distinct 
principle 
of 
selfhood 
seems 
an 
integral 
part. 
Whatever 
solution 
be 
adopted 
in 
the 
pages 
to 
come, 
we 
may 
as 
well 
make 
up 
our

in

that 
it 
will 
fail 
to 
satisfy 
the 
majority 
of 
those 
to 
whom 
it 
is 
addressed. 
The 
best 
way 
of 
approaching 
the 
matter 
will 
be 
to 
take 
up 
first-TheSenseofPersonalIdentity.

It

of

These 
things

a

thus 
it

that

among

It 
is 
a 
conclusion 
grounded 
either 
on 
the

in 
a 
fundamental

on 
the

This

of

will 
be 
recognized 
by 
the

Our 
recent 
simile 
of 
the 
herd 
of 
cattle 
will 
help 
us. 
It 
will 
be 
remembered 
that 
the 
beasts 
were 
brought 
together 
into 
one 
herd 
because 
their 
owner 
found 
on 
each 
of 
them 
his 
brand. 
The 
'owner' 
symbolized 
here 
that 
'section' 
of 
consciousness, 
or 
pulse 
of 
thought, 
which 
wehave 
allalong 
represented 
asthe 
vehicleof 
the 
judgmentof 
identity; 
and 
the 
'brand' 
symbolizes 
the 
characters 
of 
warmth 
and 
continuity, 
byreasonofwhichthejudgment 
ismade. 
Thereisfounda 
self-brand,justasthereisfoundaherd-brand.Eachbrand,sofar,isthemark,orcauseofourknowing,thatcertainthingsbelong-together.Butif 
thebrandistheratiocognoscendiofthebelonging,thebelonging,inthe 
case 
of 
the

is 
in

the 
ratio

of 
the 
brand. 
No

wouldbesobrandedunlesshebelongedtotheowneroftheherd.Theyarenothisbecausetheyarebranded;theyarebrandedbecausetheyarehis.Sothatitseemsasifourdescriptionofthebelonging-togetherofthevariousselves,asabelonging-togetherwhichismerelyrepresented,inalater

had

mere

of

or

ascertained 
after 
the 
fact. 
Sheissurethatit 
involvesa 
real 
belonging 
to 
arealOwner, 
toa 
pure 



spiritual 
entityofsome 
kind. 
Relationto 
this

to 
whichthebeastsaredrivenandbywhichtheyareheld.Thebeastsstick

by

Just 
so, 
common-sense 
insists, 
there 
must 
be 
a 
real 
proprietor 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
selves, 
or 
else 
their 
actualaccretionintoa'personalconsciousness'wouldneverhavetaken 
place. 


Totheusualempiricistexplanationofpersonalconsciousnessthisis 
a 
formidable 
reproof, 
because 
all 
the 
individual 
thoughts 
and 
feelings 
which 
have 
succeeded 
each 
other 
'up 
to 
date' 
are 
represented 
by 
ordinary 
Associationism 
as 
in 
some 
inscrutable 
way 
'integrating' 
or 
gummingthemselvestogetherontheirownaccount,andthusfusinginto 
a 
stream. 
All 
the 
incomprehensibilities 
which 
in 
Chapter

we 
saw 
to 
attach 
to 
the 
idea 
of 
things 
fusing 
without 
a 
medium 
apply 
to 
the 
empiricistdescriptionofpersonalidentity. 
Butinourownaccountthe 
medium 
is 
fully 
assigned, 
the 
herdsman 
is 
there, 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
something 
not 
among 
the 
things 
collected, 
but 
superior 
to 
them 
all, 
namely, 
the 
real, 
present

entire 
stream 
of 
thoughtandalltheselvesthatmayberepresentedinit,astheeverselfsame 
and 
changeless 
principle 
implied 
in 
their 
union. 
The 
'Soul' 
of 
Metaphysicsandthe'TranscendentalEgo'oftheKantianPhilosophy,are, 
as 
we 
shall 
soon 
see, 
but 
attempts 
to 
satisfy 
this 
urgent 
demand 
of 
common-sense.But,foratimeatleast,wecanstillexpresswithoutanysuchhypothesesthatappearanceofnever-lapsingownershipforwhichcommon-sensecontends. 


For 
how 
would 
it 
be 
if 
the 
Thought, 
the 
present 
judging 
Thought, 
instead 
of 
being 
in 
any 
way 
substantially 
or 
transcendentally 
identical 
withtheformerownerofthepastself, 
merelyinheritedhis 
'title,'and 
thus 
stood 
as 
his 
legal 
representative 
now? 
It 
would 
then, 
if 
its 
birth 
coincided 
exactly 
with 
the 
death 
of 
another 
owner, 
find 
the 
past 
self 
alreadyitsownassoonasitfounditatall,andthepastselfwouldthus 
never 
be 
wild, 
but 
always 
owned, 
by 
a 
title 
that 
never 
lapsed. 
We 
can 
imaginealongsuccessionofherdsmencomingrapidlyintopossessionofthesamecattlebytransmissionofanoriginaltitlebybequest.Maynot 
the 
'title'ofacollectiveselfbepassedfromoneThoughttoanotherinsomeanalogousway? 


It 
is 
a 
patent 
fact 
of 
consciousness 
that 
a 
transmission 
like 
this 
actually 
occurs. 
Each 
pulse 
of 
cognitive 
consciousness, 
each 
Thought, 
dies 
away 
and 
is 
replaced 
by 
another. 
The 
other, 
among 
the 
things 
it 
knows,knowsitsownpredecessor,andfindingit'warm,'inthewaywe 
havedescribed, 
greetsit, 
saying: 
"Thouartmine, 
andpartofthesame 
self 
with 
me." 
Each 
later 
Thought, 
knowing 
and 
including 
thus 
the 
Thoughtswhichwentbefore,isthefinalreceptacle-andappropriating

bothupintoitsconsciousnessandpassedthemtoathird,untilthelastballheldallthattheotherballshadheld,andrealizeditasitsown.Itis 
this 
trick 
which 
the 
nascent 
thought 
has 
of 
immediately 
taking 
up 
the 
expiring 
thought 
and 
'adopting' 
it, 
which 
is 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
appropriationofmostoftheremoterconstituentsoftheself.Whoowns 
the 
last 
self 
owns 
the 
self 
before 
the 
last, 
for 
what 
possesses 
the

It 
is 
impossible 
to 
discover 
any 
verifiable 
features 
in 
personalidentity,whichthissketchdoesnotcontain,impossibletoimaginehowanytranscendent 
non-phenomenal 
sort 
ofan 
Arch-Ego, 
werehe 
there, 
could 
shape 
matters 
to 
any 
other

or

by

past 
stream; 
and 
which 
should 
similarly 
adopt 
the 
objects 
already 
adopted 
by 
any 
portion 
of 
this 
spiritual 
stream. 
Such 
standing-asrepresentative, 
and 
such 
adopting, 
are 
perfectly 
clear 
phenomenal 
relations.TheThoughtwhich,whilstitknowsanotherThoughtandthe 
Object 
of 
that 
Other, 
appropriates 
the 
Other 
and 
the 
Object 
which 
the 
Other 
appropriated, 
is 
still 
a 
perfectly 
distinct 
phenomenon 
form 
that 
Other;itmayhardlyresembleit;itmaybefarremovedfromitinspaceandtime. 


The 
only 
point 
that 
is 
obscure 
is 
the 
act 
of 
appropriation 
itself. 
Already 
in 
enumerating 
the 
constituents 
of 
the 
self 
and 
their 
rivalry, 
I 
hadtousethewordappropriate.Andthequick-wittedreaderprobably 
noticed 
at 
the 
time, 
in 
hearing 
how 
one 
constituent 
was 
let 
drop 
and 
disownedandanotheroneheldfasttoandespoused,thatthephrasewasmeaningless 
unless 
the

were 
objects 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
somethingelse.Athingcannotappropriateitself;itisitself;andstillless 
can 
it 
disown

There 
must 
be 
an 
agent 
of 
the 
appropriating 
and 
disowning;butthatagentwehavealreadynamed. 
ItistheThoughtto

object 
in 
its 
own 
hands, 
it 
never 
appropriates 
or 
disowns 
itself. 
It 
appropriates 
to 
itself, 
it 
is 
the 
actual 
focus 
of 
accretion, 
the 
hook 
from 



which 
the 
chain 
of 
past 
selves 
dangles, 
planted 
firmly 
in 
the 
Present, 
which 
alone 
passes 
for 
real, 
and 
thus 
keeping 
the

and 
then

for 
its

and 
of

of 
thoughts,

substantially 
different 
from 
the 
rest, 
but 
cognitive 
of 
the

and 
'appropriative' 
of 
each 
other's 
content. 
At

if 
I 
have 
not 
already 
succeeded 
in 
making 
this 
plausible 
to 
the

I 
am 
hopeless 
of

individuality, 
and 
the 
immateriality 
that 
appear 
in 
the 
psychic

are 
thus 
accounted 
for 
as 
phenomenal 
and 
temporal

or

We

unique 
in 
the 
sense 
of

(above,

of

simply 
correspond, 
and 
second, 
of

to 
whose

see 
that 
at

the 
second 
formulation 
is 
only 
a 
more 
roundabout 
waythanthefirst,ofexpressingthesamebaldfact.Thatbaldfactisthat

that 
the 
brain-processes 
knock 
the

so 
to 
speak, 
out 
of 
a 
Soul 



which 
stands 
there 
to 
receive 
their 
influence. 
The 
simpler 
formulation 
saysthatthethoughtsimplycomes.ButwhatpositivemeaninghastheSoul,whenscrutinized,butthegroundofpossibilityofthethought?Andwhatisthe'knocking'butthedeterminingofthepossibilitytoactuality? 
And 
what 
is 
this 
after 
all 
but 
giving 
a 
sort 
of 
concreted 
form 
to 
one's 
belief 
that 
the 
coming 
of 
the 
thought, 
when 
the 
brain-processes 
occur, 
has 
some 
sort 
of 
ground 
in 
the 
nature 
of 
things? 
If 
the 
world

understoodmerelytoexpressthatclaim,itisagoodwordtouse.Butifitbe 
held 
to

to

To

more 
we 
give 
the 
provisional 
name 
of 
Substance. 
So, 
in 
the 
present 
instance, 
we 
ought 
certainly 
to 
admit 
that 
there 
is 
more 
than 
the

But 
wedonotanswerthequestion'Whatisthatmore?'whenwesaythatit

kind

explainsnothing;andwhenweareoncetryingmetaphysicalexplanationswearefoolish 
not 
to

as

For 
my 
own 
part 
I 
confess 
that 
the 
moment 
I 
become 
metaphysical 
and 
try 
to 
define

I 
find

would

The

andeventheywillhavetoadmitthatspontaneityisjustaspossible,tosay 
the

in

'Thought' 
as

a 
permanentonelikethesupposedSoul.Thesameistrueoftheargument 
from 
the 
kinds 
of 
things

Even 
if 
the 
brain 
could 
not 
cognize 
universals, 
immaterials, 
or 
its 
'Self,' 
still 
the 
'Thought'

The 
great 
difficulty 
is 
in 
seeing 
how 
a 
thing 
can 
cognize 
anything. 
This 
difficultyisnotintheleastremovedbygivingtothethingthatcognizesthenameofSoul.TheSpiritualistsdonotdeduceanyofthepropertiesofthementallifefromotherwiseknownpropertiesofthesoul.Theysimplyfindvariouscharactersready-madeinthementallife,andthesetheyclapintotheSoul,saying,"Lo!beholdthesourcefromwhencetheyflow!"The 
merely 
verbal 
character 
of 
this 
'explanation' 
is 
obvious. 
The 
Soul 
invoked,farfrommakingthephenomenamoreintelligible,canonlybemadeintelligibleitselfbyborrowingtheirform,-itmustberepresented, 
ifatall, 
asatranscendentstreamofconsciousnessduplicatingtheoneweknow. 


Altogether, 
the 
Soul 
is 
an 
outbirth 
of 
that 
sort 
of 
philosophizing 
whose 
great 
maxim, 
according 
to 
Dr. 
Hodgson, 
is: 
"Whatever 
you 
are 
totallyignorantof,asserttobetheexplanationofeverythingelse."

Most 
modern 
writers 
of 
the 
mitigated, 
spiritualistic, 
or 
dualistic 
philosophy 
-the 
Scotchschool,asitisoftencalledamongus-areforwardtoproclaimthisignorance,andtoattendexclusivelytotheverifiablephenomenaofselfconsciousness, 
as 
we 
have 
laid 
them 
down. 
Dr. 
Wayland, 
for 
example, 
begins 
his 
Elements 
of 
Intellectual 
Philosophy 
with 
the 
phrase 
"Of 
the 
essenceofMindweknownothing,"andgoeson:"Allthatweareableto 
affirmofitisthatitissomethingwhichperceives,reflects,remembers,

of 
that 
essence 
of 
which 
they 
are 
predicated. 
In 
these 
respects 
our 
knowledgeofmindispreciselyanalogoustoourknowledgeofmatter."
This 
analogy 
of 
our 
two 
ignorances 
is 
a 
favorite 
remark 
in 
the 
Scotch 
school.Itisbutasteptolumpthemtogetherintoasingleignorance,thatofthe'Unknowable'towhichanyonefondofsuperfluitiesinphilosophy

The 
first 
of 
these 
is 
Immortality, 
for 
which 
the 
simplicity

The 
Soul, 
however, 
when 
closely 
scrutinized, 
guarantees 
no 
immortality 
of 
a 
sort 
we 
care 
for. 
The 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
atom-like 
simplicity

The 
demand 
for 
immortality 
is 
nowadays 
essentially 
teleological. 
We 
believe 
ourselves 
immortal 
because 
we 
believe 
ourselves 
fit 
for 
immortality.

It 
was 
supposed 
scandalous 
that 
our 
forgetfulness 
might 
thus 
deprive 
God 
of 
the 
chance 
of 
certain 
retributions, 
which 
otherwise 
would 
have 
enhanced 
his 
'glory.' 
This 
is 
certainly 
a 
good 
speculative 
ground 
for 
retaining 
the 
Soul 
-at 
least 
for 
those 
who 
demand 
a 
plenitude 
of 
retribution. 
The 
mere 
stream 
of 
consciousness, 
with 
its 
lapses 
of

cannot 
possibly 
be 
as 
'responsible'

Attention. 


Strangetosay,sopatentafactastheperpetualpresenceofselectiveattention 
has 
received 
hardly 
any 
notice 
from 
psychologists 
of 
the 
English 
empiricist 
school. 
The 
Germans 
have 
explicitly 
treated 
of 
it,
eitherasafacultyorasaresultant,butinthepagesofsuchwritersasLocke,Hume,Hartley,theMills,andSpencerthewordhardlyoccurs,orifitdoesso,itisparentheticallyandasifbyinadvertence.1Themotiveofthisignoringofthephenomenonofattentionisobviousenough. 
These 
writers 
are 
bent 
on 
showing 
how 
the 
higher 
faculties 
of 
the 
mind 
are 
pure 
products 
of 
'experience;' 
and 
experience 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
of 
something 
simply 
given. 
Attention, 
implying 
a 
degree 
of 
reactive 
spontaneity,wouldseemtobreakthroughthecircleofpurereceptivitywhichconstitutes 
'experience,'andhencemustnotbespokenofunderpenaltyofinterferingwiththesmoothnessofthetale. 


Butthemomentonethinksofthematter,oneseeshowfalseanotion 
of 
experience 
that 
is 
which 
would 
make 
it 
tantamount 
to 
the 
mere 
presence 
to 
the 
senses 
of 
an 
outward 
order. 
Millions 
of 
items 
of 
the 
outwardorderarepresenttomysenseswhichneverproperlyenterinto 
my 
experience. 
Why? 
Because 
they 
have 
no 
interest 
for 
me. 
My 
experienceiswhatIagreetoattendto.OnlythoseitemswhichInotice 
shapemymind-withoutselectiveinterest,experienceisanutterchaos. 
Interest 
alone 
gives 
accent 
and 
emphasis, 
light 
and 
shade, 
background 
and 
foreground 
-intelligible 
perspective, 
in 
a 
word. 
It

everycreature,butwithoutittheconsciousnessofeverycreaturewouldbeagraychaoticindiscriminateness,impossibleforuseventoconceive.Such 
anempiricistwriterasMr.Spencer,forexample,regardsthecreatureas

The 
claywillbeimpressedmostdeeplywherethedropsfallthickest,andsothefinal 
shape 
of 
the 
mind 
is 
moulded. 
Give 
time 
enough, 
and 
all 
sentient 
things 
ought, 
at 
this 
rate, 
to 
end 
by 
assuming 
an 
identical 
mental 
constitution-for'experience,'thesoleshaper,isaconstantfact,andthe

of

to

the

to 
it 
of 
more 
than 
one 
objective 
fact,

It

and

It 
is 
obvious 
that 
such 
observations 
decide 
nothing 
at 
all 
about 
our 
attention, 
properly 
so 
called. 
They 
rather

But 
where 
the

breaks 
into 
parts 
disconnected 
with 
each 
other, 
and 
forming 
each

a

not

it 
becomeshardertoapprehendallthesepartsatonce,andthemindtendstoletgoofonewhilstitattendstoanother.Still,withinlimitsthiscanbe

M. 
Paulhan 
has 
experimented 
carefully 
on 
the 
matter 
bydeclaimingonepoemaloudwhilstherepeatedadifferentonementally, 
or 
by 
writing 
one 
sentence 
whilst 
speaking

or 
by 
performingcalculationsonpaperwhilstrecitingpoetry.8Hefoundthat 


"the 
most 
favorable

was

Twooperationsofthesamesort,twomultiplications,tworecitations,orthe 
reciting 
one 
poem 
and 
writing

render 
the 
process 
more 
uncertainanddifficult." 


The 
attention 
often, 
but 
not 
always, 
oscillates 
during 
these 
performances;andsometimesawordfromonepartofthetaskslipsintoanother.ImyselffindwhenItrytosimultaneouslyreciteonethingandwriteanotherthatthebeginningofeachwordorsegmentofaphraseiswhatrequirestheattention.Oncestarted,mypenrunsonforawordortwoasifbyitsownmomentum.M.Paulhancomparedthetimeoccupiedbythesametwooperationsdonesimultaneouslyorinsuccession, 
and 
foundthattherewasoftenaconsiderablegainoftimefromdoingthem

"

Oragain: 


"I

so 
that 
there 
is 
no

from

Of 
course 
these 
time-measurements 
lack 
precision. 
With 
three

Professor 
Exner, 
whose 
experiments 
on 
the 
minimal 
perceptiblesuccessionintimeoftwosensationsweshallhavetoquoteinanotherchapter, 
makes 
some 
noteworthy 
remarks 
about 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
attention 
must 
be 
set 
to 
catch 
the 
interval 
and 
the 
right 
order 
of 
the 
sensations, 
when 
the 
time 
is 
exceeding 
small. 
The 
point 
was 
to 
tell 
whethertwosignalsweresimultaneousorsuccessive;and,ifsuccessive,
whichoneofthemcamefirst. 


The 
first 
way 
of 
attending 
which 
he 
found 
himself 
to 
fall 
into, 
was 
when 
the 
signals 
did 
not 
differ 
greatly 
-when, 
e.g., 
they 
were 
similar 
sounds 
heard 
each 
by 
a 
different 
ear. 
Here 
he 
lay 
in 
wait 
for 
the 
first 
signal, 
whichever 
it 
might 
be, 
and 
identified 
it 
the 
next 
moment 
in 
memory.Thesecond,whichcouldthenalwaysbeknownbydefault,wasoftennotclearlydistinguishedinitself.Whenthetimewastooshort,thefirstcouldnotbeisolatedfromthesecondatall. 


Thesecondwaywastoaccommodatetheattentionforacertainsortofsignal,andthenextmomenttobecomeawareinmemoryofwhetheritcamebeforeorafteritsmate. 


"This 
way 
brings 
great 
uncertainty 
with 
it. 
The 
impression 
not 
prepared 
for 
comes 
to 
us 
in 
the 
memory 
more 
weak 
than

Intheexperimentsfromtouchtosightitoften

me 
as

Exner 
found 
himself 
employing 
this 
method 
oftenest 
when 
the 
impressionsdifferedstrongly.10 


In 
such 
observations 
(which 
must 
not 
be 
confounded 
with

Now 
the 
case 
of 
the 
signals 
being 
simultaneous 
seems 
of 
a 
different 
sort. 
We 
must 
turn 
to 
Wundt 
for 
observationsfittocastanearerlightthereon. 


The 
reader 
will 
remember 
the 
reaction-time 
experiments 
of 
which 
we 
treated 
in 
Chapter 
III. 
It 
happened 
occasionally 
in 
Wundt's 
experimentsthatthereaction-timewasreducedtozeroorevenassumed 
a 
negative 
value, 
which, 
being 
translated 
into 
common 
speech, 
means 
that 
the 
observer 
was 
sometimes 
so 
intent 
upon 
the 
signal 
that 
his 
reactionactuallycoincidedintimewithit,orevenprecededit,insteadofcomingafractionofasecondafterit,asinthenatureofthingsitshould.
Morewillbesaidoftheseresultsanon.MeanwhileWundt,inexplaining 
them, 
says 
this: 
"In 
general 
we 
have 
a 
very 
exact 
feeling 
of

aseriesofexperimentsinwhichawarningprecedes,atafixedinterval,

involuntarily 
try 
to 
react, 
not 
only 
as 
promptly 
as 
possible,butalsoinsuchwisethatourmovementmaycoincidewiththestimulus 
itself. 
We 
seek 
to 
make 
our 
own 
feelings 
of 
touch 
and 
innervation 
[muscular 
contraction] 
objectively 
contemporaneous 
with

Inanotherplace,Wundtadds:

The

Wundt 
accordingly 
distinguishes 
the 
direction 
from 
the 
amount 
of 
the 
apparent 
displacement 
in 
time 
of 
the 
bell-stroke. 
The 
direction 
depends 
on 
the 
rapidity 
of 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
index 
and 
(consequently)onthatofthesuccessionofthebell-strokes.Themoment 
atwhichthebellstruckwasestimatedbyhimwiththeleasttendencytoerror,whentherevolutionstookplaceonceinasecond.Fasterthanthis,

the

the

the

Finally, 
individual 
differences 
prevail, 
as 
well 
as 
differences 
in 
the

individual 
at

of 
the 
index 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
a 
whole 
group 
of 
things 
was 
happening. 
The 
single 
bell-stroke 
was 
always 
heard 
too 
early 
by 
von 
Tschisch 
-the 
displacement 
was 
invariably 
'negative.' 
As 
the 
other 
simultaneous 
impressions 
were 
added, 
the 
displacement 
first 
became 
zero 
and 
finally 
positive, 
i.e. 
the 
impressions 
were 
connected 
with 
a 
position 
of 
the 
index 
that 
was 
too 
late. 
This 
retardation 
was 
greater 
when 
the 
simultaneous 
impressions 
were 
disparate 
(electric 
tactile 
stimuliondifferentplaces,simpletouch-stimuli,differentsounds)thanwhen 
they 
were 
all 
of 
the 
same 
sort. 
The 
increment 
of 
retardation 
became 
relatively 
less 
with 
each 
additional 
impression, 
so 
that 
it 
is 
probablethatsiximpressionswouldhavegivenalmostthesameresultasfive,whichwasthemaximumnumberusedbyHerrvonT. 


Wundt 
explains 
all 
these 
results 
byhis 
previous 
observation 
that 
a 
reactionsometimesantedatesthesignal(seeabove,p. 
411). 
Themind, 
he 
supposes, 
is 
so 
intent 
upon 
the 
bell-strokes 
that 
its 
'apperception' 
keepsripeningperiodicallyaftereachstrokeinanticipationofthenext.

If

then

if

it 
hears

so-called

our

we 
are 
all 
familiar

The 
passive 
sensorial 
attention 
is 
derived 
when 
the 
impression, 
without 
being 
either 
strong

Helmholtz, 
who 
has 
put 
his 
sensorial 
attention 
to 
the 
severest 
tests, 
by 
using 
his 
eyes 
on 
objects 
which 
in

are 
expresslyoverlooked,makessomeinterestingremarksonthispointinhischapteronretinalrivalry.22Thephenomenoncalledbythatnameisthis,

if

(as

sometimes 
one 
picture, 
sometimes 
the 
other, 
or 
parts 
of 
both, 
will 
come 
to 
consciousness, 
hardly 
ever 
both 
combined.Helmholtznowsays: 


"IfindthatIamabletoattendvoluntarily,nowtooneandnowtotheothersystemoflines;andthatthenthissystemremainsvisiblealonefor

And 
again 
criticising 
an 
author 
who 
had 
treated 
of 
attention 
as 
an 



activityabsolutelysubjecttotheconsciouswill,Helmholtzwrites:

when 
our 
interest 
in 
the 
object 
is 
exhausted, 
and 
the 
purpose 
is 
inwardly 
formulated 
in 
this 
abstract 
way. 
But 
we 
can 
set 
ourselves 
new 
questions 
about 
the 
object, 
so 
that 
a 
new 
interest 
in 
it 
arises, 
and 
then 
the

remain 
riveted.

that

tends 
actually 
to 
prevent 
a 
man 
from 
acquiring

that 
moderate

These 
are 
essentially 
products 
of 
intellectual 
discrimination, 
involving 
comparison, 
memory, 
and 
perception 
of 
various 
relations. 
The 
attention 
per 
se 
does 
not 
distinguish 
and 
analyze 
and 
relate. 
The 
most 
we 
can 
say 
is 
that 
it

a 
condition 
of 
our 
doing 
so.

to 
be 
described 
later, 
the 
clearness 
they 
produce 
had

important 
point 
to

is 
that

Dugald

says:28 
"The

by 
many

deal 
to 
be 
said 
of 
Attention's 
effects. 
Since 
Wundt 
has 
probably 
worked 
over 
the 
subject 
more 
thoroughly 
than 
any 
other 
investigator 
and 
made 
it 
peculiarly 
his 
own, 
what 
follows 
had 
better, 
as 
far 
as 
possible, 
be 
in 
his 
words. 
The 
reader 
will 
remember 
the 
method 
and 
resultsofexperimentationon'reaction-time,'asgiveninChapterIII.The 
facts 
I 
proceed 
to 
quote 
may 
also 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
supplement 
to 
that 
chapter.Wundtwrites: 


"When 
we 
wait 
with 
strained 
attention 
for 
a 
stimulus, 
it 
will 
often 
happen 
that

registering 
the

we 
react 
upon 
some

On 
the

we 
are 
perfectly

But 
even 
this

may 
disappear, 
i.e.

both 
at 
the

As 
the 
execution 
of 
the

must 
precede 
our 
feeling 
of 
it, 
so 
it 
must 
also 
precede 
the

The 
peculiar 
theoretic 
interest 
of 
these 
experiments 
lies 
in 
their 
showingexpectantattentionandsensationtobecontinuousoridentical 
processes, 
since 
they 
may 
have 
identical 
motor 
effects. 
Although 
other 
exceptional 
observations 
show 
them 
likewise 
to 
be 
continuous 
subjectively. 
Wundt's 
experiments 
do 
not: 
he 
seems 
never, 
at

As

conversely,

"If,e.g.,wemakereactionsonasoundinsuchawaythatweakandstrongstimuliirregularlyalternatesothattheobservercanneverexpect

but 
for 
whose 
intensity 
attention 
cannot 
be 
adapted 
in

demands 
a 
longer 
reaction-time. 
In 
such 
cases 
. 
. 
. 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
difference 
can 
only 
lie 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
wherever 
a 
preparation 
of 
the 
attention 
is 
impossible, 
the 
time 
of 
both 
perception 
and 
volition 
is 
prolonged. 
Perhaps 
also 
the 
conspicuously

minimalamountofstimulus,sothatastateensuessimilartothatinthecaseofunexpected

.. 
. 
Still 
more 
thanbypreviouslyunknown 
stimuli 
is 
the 
reaction-time 
prolonged 
by 
wholly 
unexpected 
impressions. 
This 
is 
sometimes 
accidentally 
brought 
about, 
when 
the 
observer'sattention,insteadofbeingconcentratedonthecomingsignal, 
is 
dispersed. 
It 
can 
be 
realized 
purposely 
by 
suddenly 
thrusting 
into 
a 
long 
series 
of 
equidistant 
stimuli 
a 
much 
shorter 
interval 
which 
the 
observer 
does 
not 
expect. 
The 
mental 
effect 
here 
is 
like 
that 
of 
being 
startled; 
-often 
the 
startling 
is 
outwardly 
visible. 
The 
time 
of 
reaction 
may 
then 
easily 
be 
lengthened 
to 
one 
quarter 
of 
a 
second 
with 
strong 
signals, 
or 
with 
weak 
ones 
to 
a 
half-second. 
Slighter, 
but 
still 
very 
noticeable, 
is 
the 
retardation 
when 
the 
experiment 
is 
so 
arranged 
that 
the 
observer, 
ignorant 
whether 
the 
stimulus 
is 
to 
be 
an 
impression 
of 
light,sound,ortouch,cannotkeephisattentionturnedtoanyparticular 
sense-organ 
in 
advance. 
One 
notices 
then 
at 
the 
same 
time 
a 
peculiar 
unrest, 
as 
the 
feeling 
of 
strain 
which 
accompanies 
the 
attention 
keeps 
vacillatingbetweentheseveralsenses. 


"Complications 
of 
another 
sort 
arise 
when 
what 
is 
registered 
is 
an 
impression 
anticipated 
both 
in 
point 
of 
quality 
and 
strength, 
but 
accompanied 
by 
other 
stimuli 
which 
make 
the 
concentration 
of 
the 
attention 
difficult. 
The 
reaction-time 
is 
here 
always 
more 
or 
less 
prolonged. 
The 
simplest 
case 
of 
the 
sort 
is

It 
seems 
probable, 
from 
these 
results 
obtained 
with 
elementary 
processes 
of

that 
all

even 
the 
higher 
ones

reminiscence, 
reasoning, 
etc., 
wheneverattentionisconcentratedupon 
them 
instead

Stillmoreinterestingreaction-timeobservationshavebeenmadebyMünsterberg.

recollectthefact 
noted 
in 
Chapter 
III 
(p.
93)thatreaction-timeisshorterwhenoneconcentrateshisattentionontheexpectedmovementthanwhenoneconcentratesitontheexpectedsignal. 
Herr 
Münsterberg 
found 
that 
this 
is 
equally 
the 
case 
when 
the 
reactionisnosimplereflex,butcantakeplaceonlyafteranintellectualoperation.Inaseriesofexperimentsthefivefingerswereusedtoreact 
with,and 


thereacterhadtouseadifferentfingeraccordingasthesignalwas 
of 
one 
sort 
or 
another. 
Thus 
when 
a 
word 
in 
the 
nominative 
case 
was 
called 
out 
he 
used 
the 
thumb, 
for 
the 
dative 
he 
used 
another 
finger; 
similarly 
adjectives, 
substantives, 
pronouns, 
numerals, 
etc., 
or, 
again,
towns,rivers,beasts,plants,elements;orpoets,musicians,philosophers,
etc., 
were 
co-ordinated 
each 
with 
its 
finger, 
so 
that 
when 
a 
world 
belonging 
to 
either 
of 
these 
classes 
was 
mentioned, 
a 
particular 
finger 
and 
no 
other 
had 
to 
perform 
the 
reaction. 
In 
a 
second 
series 
of 
experimentsthereactionconsistedintheutteranceofawordinanswertoaquestion,suchas"nameanediblefish,"etc.;or"namethefirstdrama 
of 
Schiller," 
etc.; 
or 
"which

Hume 
or 
Kant?" 
etc.; 
or 
(first 
naming 
apples 
and 
cherries, 
and 
several 
other 
fruits) 
"which 
do

prefer,applesorcherries?"etc.;or"whichisGoethe'sfinestdrama?"etc.; 
or"whichlettercomesthelaterinthealphabet,theletterLorthefirstletterofthemostbeautifultree?"etc.;or"whichisless,15or20minus 



8?"36 
etc. 
etc. 
etc. 
Even 
in 
this 
series 
of 
reactions 
the 
time 
was 
much 
quicker 
when 
the 
reacter 
turned 
his 
attention 
in 
advance 
towards 
the 
answer 
than 
when 
he 
turned 
it 
towards 
the 
question. 
The 
shorter 
reaction-time 
was 
seldom 
more 
than 
one 
fifth 
of 
a 
second; 
the 
longer, 
fromfourtoeighttimesaslong. 


To 
understand 
such 
results, 
one 
must 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
in 
these 
experiments 
the 
reacter 
always 
knew 
in 
advance 
in 
a 
general 
way 
thekindofquestionwhichhewastoreceive,andconsequentlythespherewithin 
which 
his 
possible 
answer 
lay.37 
In 
turning 
his 
attention,
therefore,fromtheoutsettowardstheanswer,thosebrain-processesinhim 
which 
were 
connected 
with 
this 
entire 
'sphere'

andthequestioncouldthendischargewithaminimumamountof 
lost 
time 
that 
particular 
answer

of 
the

it. 
When, 
on

the

was 
kept 
lookingtowardsthequestionexclusivelyandavertedfromthepossiblereply,allthispreliminarysub-excitementofmotortractsfailedtooccur,andtheentire 
process 
of 
answering 
had 
to 
be 
gone 
through 
with 
after 
the 
question 
was 
heard. 
No 
wonder 
that 
the 
time 
was 
prolonged. 
It 
is 
a 
beautifulexampleofthe 
summation 
ofstimulations, 
andof 
the

in

there

The

It 
has 
been 
said, 
however, 
that 
we 
may 
attend 
to 
an 
object 
on 
the 
periphery 
of 
the 
visual 
field 
and 
yet 
not 
accommodate 
the

This 
would 
be 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
invariable 
and 
universal 
presence 
of 
movements 
of 
adjustment 
as 
ingredientsoftheattentiveprocess.Usually,asiswellknown,noobject

He 
was

solid

The

were

This

rather 
than 
the

of

us 
particularly

Noting

the 
intimate 
connection 
which 
our 
account 
so

they

The 
interest 
here 
must 
be 
'derived' 
from 
something 
that 
the 
teacher 
associates 
with 
the 
task, 
a

Itakeanotherexample,fromM.B.Perez:55 


"Achildofsixyears,habituallypronetomind-wandering,satdown

'I

again, 
a

WhenwecometothechapterontheWill,

drama 
of 
the 
voluntary 
life 
hinges 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
attention, 
slightlymoreorslightlyless, 
whichrivalmotorideasmayreceive. 
But 
the 
whole 
feeling 
of 
reality, 
the 
whole 
sting 
and 
excitement 
of 
our 
voluntary 
life, 
depends 
on 
our 
sense 
that 
in 
it 
things 
are 
really 
beingdecidedfromonemomenttoanother,andthatitisnotthedullrattlingoff

so 
he 
must 
grant 
to 
us 
that 
it

And 
the 
result 
is 
two 



conceptions 
of 
possibility 
face 
to 
face 
with 
no 
facts 
definitely 
enough 
known 
to

Under 
these 
circumstances,
onecanleavethequestionopenwhilstwaitingforlight,oronecandowhatmostspeculativemindsdo,thatis,looktoone'sgeneralphilosophy

The

so 
without

and 
they 
ought 
not 
to 
refuse 
a 
similar

they

'forces'

are 
certainly 
too 
delicate 
and 
numerous 
to 
be 
followed 
in 
detail. 
Meanwhile, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
strange 
arrogance 
with 
whichthewildestmaterialisticspeculationspersistincallingthemselves'science,' 
it 
is 
well 
to 
recall 
just 
what 
the 
reasoning 
is,

the

The

doesn't

say; 
it

this

no

It

For 
the 
sake 
of 
that 
theory 
we 
make 
inductions 
from 
phenomena 
to 
others 
that 
are 
startingly 
unlike 
them; 
and 
we 
assume 
that 
a 
complication 
which 
Nature 
has 
introduced 
(the

of

of

How 
can 
impressions 
that 
are 
not 
needed 
by 
the 
intellect 
be 
thus 
shuntedofffromallrelationtotherestofconsciousness?ProfessorG.E. 
Müller 
has 
made 
a 
plausible 
reply 
to 
this 
question, 
and 
most 
of 
what 
followsisborrowedfromhim.63Hebeginswiththefactthat 


"When 
we 
first 
come 
out 
of 
a 
mill 
or 
factory, 
in 
which 
we 
have 
remainedlongenoughtogetwontedtothenoise,wefeelasifsomethingwerelacking.Ourtotalfeelingofexistenceisdifferentfromwhatitwaswhenwewereinthemill....Afriendwritestome:'Ihaveinmyroomalittleclockwhichdoesnotrunquitetwenty-fourhourswithoutwinding.
Inconsequenceofthis,itoftenstops.Sosoonasthishappens,Inoticeit,
whereasInaturallyfailtonoticeitwhengoing.Whenthisfirstbeganto 
happen, 
there 
was 
this 
modification: 
I 
suddenly 
felt 
an 
undefined 
uneasiness 
or 
sort 
of 
void, 
without 
being 
able 
to 
say 
what 
was 
the 
matter; 
and 
only 
after 
some 
consideration 
did 
I 
find 
the 
cause 
in 
the 
stoppingoftheclock.'" 


That 
the 
stopping 
of 
an 
unfelt 
stimulus 
may 
itself 
be 
felt 
is 
a 
wellknownfact:
thesleeperinchurchwhowakeswhenthesermonends;themiller 
who 
does 
the 
same 
when 
his 
wheel 
stands 
still, 
are 
stock 
examples. 
Now 
(since 
every 
impression 
falling 
on 
the 
nervous 
system 
must 
propagate 
itself 
somewhither), 
Müller 
suggests 
that 
impressionswhichcometouswhenthethought-centresarepreoccupiedwithothermatters 
may 
thereby 
be 
blocked 
or 
inhibited 
from 
invading 
these 
centres, 
and 
may 
then 
overflow 
into 
lower 
paths 
of 
discharge. 
And 
he 
farther 
suggests 
that 
if 
this 
process 
recur 
often 
enough, 
the 
side-track 
thuscreatedwillgrowsopermeableastobeused,nomatterwhatmaybegoingoninthecentresabove.Intheacquiredinattentionmentioned, 
the 
constant 
stimulus 
always 
caused 
disturbance 
at 
first; 
and 
consciousnessofitwasextrudedsuccessfullyonlywhenthebrainwasstrongly 
excited 
about 
other 
things. 
Gradually 
the 
extrusion 
became 
easier,andatlastautomatic. 


The 
side-tracks 
which 
thus 
learn 
to 
draft 
off 
the 
stimulations 
that 
interfere 
with 
thought 
cannot 
be 
assigned 
with 
any 
precision. 
They 
probably 
terminate 
in 
organic 
processes, 
or 
insignificant 
muscular 



contractions 
which, 
when 
stopped 
by 
the 
cessation 
of 
their 
instigatingcause,immediatelygiveusthefeelingthatsomethingisgonefromourexistence 
(as 
Müller 
says), 
or 
(as 
his 
friend 
puts 
it) 
the 
feeling 
of 
a 
void.64 


Müller's 
suggestion 
awakens 
another. 
It 
is 
a 
well-known 
fact 
that 
personsstrivingtokeeptheirattentiononadifficultsubjectwillresortto 
movements 
of 
various 
unmeaning 
kinds, 
such 
as

Note, 
however, 
that 
we 
are 
in 
the

speaking 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
samenessfromthepointofviewofthemind'sstructurealone,andnot 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
universe. 
We 
are 
psychologizing, 
not 
philosophizing. 
That 
is, 
we 
do 
not 
care 
whether 
there 
be 
any 
real 
sameness 
in 
things 
or 
not, 
or 
whether

The

The 
function 
by 
which 
we 
thus 
identify 
a 
numerically 
distinct 
and 
permanentsubjectofdisclosureiscalledCONCEPTION;andthethoughtswhichareitsvehiclesarecalledconcepts.Buttheword'concept'isoften 
used 
as 
if 
it 
stood 
for 
the 
object 
of 
discourse 
itself; 
and 
this 
looseness 
feeds 
such 
evasiveness 
in 
discussion 
that 
I 
shall 
avoid 
the 
use 
of 
the 
expressionconceptaltogether,andspeakof'conceivingstateofmind,'or 
something 
similar, 
instead. 
The 
word 
'conception' 
is 
unambiguous. 
It 
properly 
denotes 
neither 
the 
mental 
state 
nor 
what 
the 
mental 
state 
signifies, 
buttherelationbetweenthetwo, 
namely, 
thefunctionofthe 
mental 
state 
in 
signifying 
just 
that 
particular 
thing. 
It 
is 
plain 
that

andthesamementalstatecanbethevehicleofmanyconceptions,canmeanaparticularthing,andagreatdealmorebesides. 
Ifithassucha 
multiple 
conceptual 
function, 
it 
may 
be 
called 
an 
act 
of 
compound 
conception. 


We 
may 
conceive 
realities 
supposed 
to 
be 
extra-mental, 
as 
steam-
engine; 
fictions, 
as 
mermaid; 
or 
mere 
entia 
rationis, 
like 
difference 
or 



nonentity. 
But 
whatever 
wedoconceive, 
ourconceptionisof 
that 
and 
nothingelse 
-nothingelse, 
thatis, 
insteadofthat, 
thoughitmaybeof 
much 
else 
in 
addition 
to 
that. 
Each 
act 
of 
conception 
results 
from 
our 
attentionsinglingoutsomeonepartofthemassofmatterforthoughtwhich 
the 
world 
presents, 
and 
holding 
fast 
to 
it, 
without 
confusion.2 
Confusion 
occurs 
when 
we 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
a 
certain 
objectproposedtousisthesamewithoneofourmeaningsornot;sothattheconceptualfunctionrequires,tobecomplete,thatthethoughtshouldnotonlysay'Imeanthis,'butalsosay'Idon'tmeanthat.'3 


Each 
conception 
thus 
eternally 
remains 
what 
it 
is, 
and 
never 
can 
become 
another. 
The 
mind 
may 
change 
its 
states, 
and 
its 
meanings, 
at 
differenttimes;maydroponeconceptionandtakeupanother,butthedroppedconceptioncaninnointelligiblesensebesaidtochangeintoits

But 
my 
conception 
'white' 
does 
not 
change 
into 
my 
conception 
'black.' 
On 
the 
contrary, 
it 
stays 
alongside 
of 
the 
objective 
blackness, 
asadifferentmeaninginmymind, 
andbysodoingletsme 
judge 
the 
blackness 
as 
the

Unless 
it

I 
should 
simplysay'blackness'andknownomore.Thus,amidthefluxofopinionsandofphysicalthings,theworldofconceptions,orthingsintendedtobethoughtabout,standsstiffandimmutable,likePlato'sRealmofIdeas.4 


Some 
conceptions 
are 
of 
things, 
some 
of 
events, 
some 
of 
qualities.
Anyfact,beitthing,event,orquality,maybeconceivedsufficientlyforpurposesofidentification,ifonlyitbesingledoutandmarkedsoastoseparateitfromotherthings.Simplycallingit'this'or'that'willsuffice. 
To 
speak 
in 
technical 
language, 
a 
subject 
may 
be 
conceived 
by 
its 
denotation, 
with 
no 
connotation, 
or 
a 
very 
minimum 
of 
connotation, 
attached. 
The 
essential 
point 
is 
that 
it 
should 
be 
re-identified 
by 
us 
as 
thatwhichthetalkisabout;andnofullrepresentationofitisnecessaryforthis,evenwhenitisafullyrepresentablething. 


In 
this 
sense, 
creatures 
extremely 
low 
in 
the 
intellectual 
scale 
may 
have 
conception. 
All 
that 
is 
required 
is 
that 
they 
should 
recognize 
the 
sameexperienceagain.Apolypwouldbeaconceptualthinkerifafeelingof'Hollo!thingumbobagain!'everflittedthroughitsmind. 


Most 
of 
the 
objects 
of 
our 
thought, 
however, 
are 
to 
some 
degree 



represented 
as 
well 
as 
merely 
pointed 
out. 
Either 
they 
are 
things 
and 
events 
perceived 
or 
imagined, 
or 
they 
are 
qualities 
apprehended 
in 
a 
positive 
way. 
Even 
where 
we 
have 
no 
intuitive 
acquaintance 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
thing, 
if 
we 
know 
any 
of 
the 
relations 
of 
it 
at 
all, 
anything 
about 
it, 
that 
is 
enough

Thefactthatthesamerealtopicofdiscourseisatonetimeconceived

has 
been 
treated 
by 
many 
authors 
as 
a 
proof 
that 
conceptions 
themselves 
are 
fertile 
and 
self-developing. 
A 
conception,accordingtotheHegelizersinphilosophy,'developsitsown

'makes

the

hitherto

Now 
I 
say 
that 
where 
the 
new 
knowledge 
merely 
comes 
from 
thinking, 
the 
facts 
are 
essentially 
the 
same,

For 
if 
the 
alleged 
cases 
of 
self-development 
be 
examined 
it 
will 
be 
found, 
I 
believe, 
that 
the 
new 
truth 
affirms 
in 
every 
case 
a 
relation 
between 
the 
original 
subject 
of 
conception 
and 
some 
new 
subject 
conceived 
later 
on. 
These

Take 
'thirteen' 
for

which 
is 
said 
to 
develop 
into

What 
really 
happens 
is 
that 
we 
compare 
the 
utterly

of

This

It

'Abstract'Ideas. 



We 
have 
now 
to 
pass 
to 
a 
less 
excusable 
mistake. 
There

I 
will 
be 
silent 
of 
mediæval 
Nominalism, 
and 
begin 
with 
Berkeley, 
who 
is 
supposed 
to 
have 
rediscovered 
the 
doctrine 
for 
himself. 
His 
asseverations 
against 
'abstract 
ideas' 
are 
among 
the 
oftenest 
quoted 
passagesinphilosophicliterature. 


"It

he 
says, 
"on

that

James 
Mill, 
to 
be 
sure, 
chimes 
in 
heroicallyinthechapteronClassificationofhis'Analysis';butinhisson 
Johnthenominalisticvoicehasgrownsoweakthat,

This 
is, 
of

the 
doctrine 
which 
we 
have 
professed. 
John

says:

From 
every 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
overwhelming 
and 
portentous 
character 
ascribed 
to 
universal 
conceptions 
is 
surprising. 
Why, 
from 
PlatoandAristotledownwards,philosophersshouldhaveviedwitheachotherinscornoftheknowledgeoftheparticular,andinadorationofthatof 
the 
general, 
is 
hard 
to 
understand, 
seeing 
that 
the 
more 
adorable 
knowledge 
ought 
to 
be 
that 
of 
the 
more 
adorable 
things, 
and 
that 
the 
things 
of 
worth 
are 
all 
concretes 
and 
singulars. 
The 
only 
value 
of 
universal 
characters 
is 
that 
they 
help 
us, 
by 
reasoning, 
to 
know 
new 
truths 
about 
individual 
things. 
The 
restriction 
of 
one's 
meaning, 
moreover, 
to 
an 
individual 
thing, 
probably 
requires 
even 
more 
complicatedbrain-processesthanitsextensiontoalltheinstancesofakind;andthemeremystery,assuch,oftheknowledge,isequallygreat,
whether 
generals 
or 
singulars 
be 
the 
things

In 
sum, 
therefore, 
the 
traditional 
universal-worship 
can 
only 
be 
called 
a 
bit 
of 
perverse 
sentimentalism,aphilosophic'idolofthecave.'

some

who

that 
they

a

will 
still 
prefer 
saying 
they

after

on

Discrimination 
and 
Comparison. 


It 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
popular 
observation 
that 
some 
men 
have 
sharper 
senses 
than 
others, 
and 
that 
some 
have 
acuter 
minds 
and 
are 
able 
to 
'splithairs'andseetwoshadesofmeaningwherethemajorityseebut 
one. 
Locke 
long 
ago 
set 
apart 
the 
faculty 
of 
discrimination 
as 
one 
in 
whichmendifferindividually.Whathewroteisgoodenoughtoquoteasanintroductiontothischapter: 


"Another 
faculty 
we 
may 
take 
notice 
of 
in 
our 
minds 
is 
that 
of 
discerninganddistinguishingbetweentheseveralideasithas. 
Itisnot 
enough 
to 
have 
a 
confused 
perception 
of 
something 
in 
general: 
unless 
themindhadadistinctperceptionofdifferentobjectsandtheirqualities,
it 
would 
be 
capable 
of 
very 
little 
knowledge; 
though 
the 
bodies 
that 
affect 
us 
were 
as 
busy 
about 
us 
as 
they 
are 
now, 
and 
the 
mind 
were 
continually 
employed 
in 
thinking. 
On 
this 
faculty 
of 
distinguishing 
one 
thingfromanotherdependstheevidenceandcertaintyofseveralevenverygeneralpropositions,whichhavepassedforinnatetruths;because 
men, 
overlookingthetruecausewhythosepropositionsfinduniversalassent,

it

or

But 
of 
this 
more 
hereafter. 


"Howmuchtheimperfectionofaccuratelydiscriminatingideasonefromanotherlieseitherinthedulnessorfaultsoftheorgansofsense,orwant

or

in

I 
will 
not 
here 
examine:itsufficestotakenoticethatthisisoneoftheoperationsthatthemindmayreflectonandobserveinitself.Itisofthatconsequenceto 
its

that 
so 
far 
as 
this

is 
in 
itself 
dull, 
or 
not

our 
notions 
are 
confused, 
and 
our 
reason 
and 
judgment 
disturbed 
or 
misled. 
If 
in 
having 
our 
ideas 
in 
the 
memory 
ready 
at 
hand 
consists 
quickness 
of 
parts; 
in 
this 
of 
having 
them 
unconfused, 
and 
being 
able 
nicelytodistinguishonethingfromanotherwherethereisbuttheleast 



difference, 
consists 
in 
a 
great 
measure 
the 
exactness 
of 
judgment 
and 
clearnessofreasonwhichistobeobservedinonemanaboveanother. 
And 
hence, 
perhaps, 
may 
be 
given 
some 
reason 
of 
that 
common 
observation, 
--that 
men 
who 
have 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
wit 
and 
promptmemorieshavenotalwaystheclearestjudgmentordeepestreason.For, 
wit

in 
the 
assemblage 
of

and

and

wherein 
can 
be 
found 
any 
resemblance 
or 
congruity,therebytomakeuppleasantpicturesandagreeablevisionsinthe 
fancy; 
judgment, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
lies 
quite 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
in 
separating 
carefully 
one 
from 
another 
ideas 
wherein 
can 
be 
found 
the 
least 
difference, 
thereby 
to 
avoid 
being 
misled 
by 
similitude 
and 
by 
affinitytotakeonethingforanother.Thisisawayofproceedingquite

to

ButLocke'sdescendantshavebeenslowtoenterintothepathwhosefruitfulnesswasthuspointedoutbytheirmaster,andhavesoneglectedthe 
study 
of 
discrimination 
that 
one 
might 
almost 
say 
that 
the

English 
psychologists

as 
a 
school, 
hardly 
recognized 
it 
to 
exist. 
'Association'hasproveditselfintheirhandstheoneall-absorbingpower 
of

Dr. 
Martineau, 
in 
his 
review 
of 
Bain, 
makes 
some 
very 
weightyremarksonthisonesidednessoftheLockianschool.Ourmental 
history,sayshe,is,initsview, 


"a 
perpetual 
formation 
of 
new 
compounds: 
and 
the 
words 
'association,''cohesion,''fusion,''indissolubleconnection,'allexpressthe 
changefrompluralityofdatatosomeunityofresult.Anexplanationof 
the 
process 
therefore 
requires 
two 
things: 
a 
true 
enumeration 
of 
the 
primary 
constituents, 
and 
a 
correct 
statement 
of 
their 
laws 
of 
combination: 
just 
as, 
in 
chemistry, 
we 
are 
furnished 
with 
a 
list 
of 
the 
simpleelements,andthewiththenprinciplesoftheirsynthesis.Nowthe 
latter 
of 
these 
two 
conditions 
we 
find 
satisfied 
by 
the 
association-
psychologists: 
but 
not 
the 
former. 
They 
are 
not 
agreed 
upon 
their 
catalogueofelements,orthemarksbywhichtheymayknowthesimplefrom 
the

The 
psychologic

instead 
of 
being 
an 
elementary 
starting-point 
with 
them, 
is 
one 
of 
the 
elaborate 
results 
of 
repetition 
and 
experience; 
and 
is 
continually 
adduced 
as 
remarkably 
illustrating 
the 
fusing 
power 
of 
habitualassociation.ThusJamesMillobserves: 


"'Itistothisgreatlawofassociationthatwetracetheformationofourideasofwhatwecallexternalobjects;thatis,theideasofacertainnumberofsensations,receivedtogethersofrequentlythattheycoalesceasitwere,andarespokenofundertheideaofunity.Hence,whatwecalltheideaofatree,theideaofastone,theideaofahorse,theideaofa

and 
this

will 
bring 
the

into 
notice 
from

previousslumber.Andthus,thatwhichbeganbybeingsimplyanobject,
cutoutfromthesurroundingscene,becomesforusfirstaredobject,andthenaredroundobject;andsoon.Instead,therefore,ofthequalities,as 
separately 
given, 
subscribing 
together 
and 
adding

up 
to 
present 
us 
with 
the

as 
their

the 
object 
is 
beforehand 
with 
them, 
and 
from 
its 
integrity 
delivers 
them 
out 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
one 
by

In 
this 
disintegration, 
the 
primary 
nucleus 
never 
loses 
its 
substantivecharacterorname;whilstthedifferencewhichitthrowsoff 



appearsasamereattribute,expressedbyanadjective. 
Henceitisthat 
we 
are 
compelled 
to 
think 
of 
the 
object 
as 
having, 
not 
as 
being, 
its 
qualities; 
and 
can 
never 
heartily 
admit 
the 
belief 
of 
any 
loose

and 
had 
we 
ten 
thousand 
senses, 
they 
would 
all 
converge 
and 
meet 
in 
but 
one 
consciousness. 
But 
if 
this 
be 
so, 
it 
is 
an 
utterfalsificationoftheorderofnaturetospeakofsensationsgroupingthemselvesintoaggregates,andsocomposingforustheobjectsofwhichwethink;andthewholelanguageofthetheory,inregardtothefieldofsynchronous

The 
truth 
is 
that 
Experience 
is 
trained 
by 
both 
association 
and 
dissociation,andthatpsychologymustbewritbothinsyntheticandinanalytic 
terms. 
Our 
original 
sensible 
totals 
are, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
subdivided 
by 
discriminative 
attention, 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
united 
with 
other 
totals, 
--either 
through 
the 
agency 
of 
our 
own 
movements,
carryingoursensesfromonepartofspacetoanother,orbecausenewobjectscomesuccessivelyandreplacethosebywhichwewereatfirstimpressed. 
The

which 
envelops 
them 
in 
space 
and 
time, 
and 
potentially 
divisible 
into 
inward 
elements 
and 
parts. 
These 
objects 
we 
break 
asunder 
and 
reunite. 
We 
must 
treat 
them 
in 
both 
ways 
for 
our 



knowledgeofthemtogrow;anditishardtosay, 
onthewhole,

The 
noticing 
of 
any 
part 
whatever 
of 
our 
object 
is 
an 
act 
of 
discrimination.Alreadyonp.404Ihavedescribedthemannerinwhich 
weoftenspontaneouslylapseintotheundiscriminatingstate,evenwithregard 
to 
objects 
which 
we 
have 
already 
learned 
to 
distinguish. 
Such 
anæsthetics 
as 
chloroform, 
nitrous 
oxide, 
etc., 
sometimes 
bring 
about 
transient 
lapses 
even 
more 
total, 
in 
which 
numerical 
discrimination 
especiallyseemsgone;foroneseeslightandhearssound,butwhether 
one

and 
so

our

be, 
that 
we 
may 
hardly 
believe 
that 
it

Butthisisanerroneousview,theundeniablefact

that 
any

THEM 
SEPARATELY, 
will 
fuse 
into 
a 
single 
undivided 
object 
for 
that

that

But 
this 
is 
nothing 
but 
the 
fatal 
'psychologists

(p.

of 
treating 
an

different 
psychoses, 
--once 
as 
an 
unbroken

and 
again 
as 
a 
sum 
of

Letthefirst 
sort 
of 
discrimination 
be 
called 
existential, 
the 
latter 
differential 
discrimination. 
A 
peculiarity 
of 
differential 
discriminations 
is 
that 
theyresultinaperceptionofdifferenceswhicharefeltasgreaterorlessonethantheother.Entiregroupsofdifferencesmayberangedinseries:the

a 
low

a

In 
passing 
from

Between

the

is 
greater

to 
put 
it 
briefly 
and 
universally, 
the 
more

such 
is 
the 
great 
synthetic 
principle 
of

In 
Chapter

we 
shall 
see 
the 
altogether 
overwhelming 
importance 
of 
this 
principle 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
all 
our 
higher 
rational 
operations. 
Are 
all

Differences

Each 
of 
the

in

of 
ourinstances, 
one 
mighteasily 
be 
tempted 
togeneralize 
and 
to 
say 
that 
all 
difference 
is 
but 
addition 
and 
subtraction, 
and 
that 
what 
we 
called 
'differential' 
discrimination 
is 
only 
'existential' 
discrimination 
in 
disguise; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
that 
where 
A 
and 
B 
differ, 
we 
merely 
discern 
something 
in 
the 
one 
which 
the 
other 
is 
without. 
Absolute 
identity 
in 
things 
up 
to 
a 
certain 
point, 
then 
absolute 
non-identity, 
would 
on 
this 
theorytaketheplaceofthoseultimatequalitativeunlikenessesbetweenthem, 
in 
which 
we 
naturally 
believe; 
and 
the 
mental 
function 
of 
discrimination,ceasingtoberegardedasanultimateone,wouldresolveitself 
into 
mere 
logical 
affirmation 
and 
negation, 
or 
perception 
that 
a 
featurefoundinonething,inanotherdoesnotexist. 


Theoretically, 
however, 
this 
theory 
is 
full 
of 
difficulty. 
If 
all 
the 
differenceswhichwefeelwereinonedirection,sothatallobjectscouldbearrangedinoneseries(howeverlong),itmightstillwork.Butwhen 
we 
consider 
the 
notorious 
fact 
that

then, 
supposingthatanobjectdifferedfromthingsinonedirectionbytheincrementd,itwouldhavetodifferfromthingsinanotherdirectionby 
a 
different 
sort 
of

call 
it 
d'; 
so 
that, 
after 
getting 
rid 
of 
qualitative 
unlikeness 
between 
objects, 
we 
should 
have

with 
everything 
else, 
and 
that 
the

of

of

is

great, 
then 
we 
see 
that

TheConditionsofDiscrimination. 


What, 
then, 
are 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
we 
discriminate 
things 
differinginasimpleway? 



First,thethingsmustBEdifferent,eitherintime,orplace,orquality.
If 
the 
difference 
in 
any 
of 
these 
regards 
is 
sufficiently 
great, 
then 
we

exceptbynotnoticingthethingsatall.

upon

It 
is 
easier 
to 
comparesuccessivethansimultaneoussounds,easiertocomparetwoweightsortwo 
temperatures 
by 
testing 
one 
after 
the 
other 
with 
the 
same 
hand, 
than 
by 
using 
both 
hands 
and 
comparing 
both 
at 
once. 
Similarly 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
discriminate 
shades 
of 
light 
or 
color 
by 
moving 
the 
eye 
from 
one 
to 
the 
other, 
so 
that 
they 
successively 
stimulate 
the 
same 
retinal 
tract.Intestingthelocaldiscriminationoftheskin,byapplyingcompasspoints,
itisfoundthattheyarefelttotouchdifferentspotsmuchmorereadilywhensetdownoneaftertheotherthanwhenbothareappliedat 
once. 
In 
the 
latter 
case 
they 
may 
be 
two 
or 
three 
inches 
apart 
on 
the 
back, 
thighs, 
etc., 
and 
still 
feel 
as 
if 
they 
were 
set 
down 
in 
one 
spot. 
Finally, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
smell 
and 
taste 
it 
is 
well-nigh 
impossible 
to 
compare 
simultaneous 
impressions 
at 
all. 
The 
reason 
why 
successive 
impression 
so 
much 
favors 
the 
result 
seems 
to 
be 
that 
there 
is 
a 
real 
sensation 
of 
difference, 
aroused 
by 
the 
shock 
of 
transition 
from 
one 
perception 
to 
another 
which 
is 
unlike 
the 
first. 
This 
sensation 
of 
difference 
has 
its 
own 
peculiar 
quality, 
as 
difference, 
which 
remains 
sensible, 
no 
matter 
of 
what 
sort 
the 
terms 
may 
be, 
between 
which 
it 
obtains. 
It 
is, 
in 
short, 
one 
of 
those 
transitive 
feelings, 
or 
feelings 
of 
relation,ofwhichItreatedinaformerplace(pp.245ff.);and,whenoncearoused, 
its 
object 
lingers 
in 
the 
memory 
along 
with 
the 
substantive 
terms 
which 
precede 
and 
follow, 
and 
enables 
our 
judgments 
of 
comparisontobemade.Weshallsoonseereasontobelievethatnotwo 
terms 
can 
possibly 
be 
simultaneously 
perceived 
to 
differ, 
unless, 
in

the 
transitional 
sensation 
of

are

Where, 
however, 
the

is 
strong, 
this

is 
immaterial,

we

The 
inference 
that 
two 
things 
differ 
because 
their 
concomitants, 
effects, 
names, 
kinds, 
or 
--toputitgenerally 
--theirsigns, 
differ, 
isof 
course 
susceptible 
of 
unlimited 
complication. 
The 
sciences 
furnish 
examples, 
in 
the 
way 
in 
which 
men 
are 
led, 
by 
noticing 
differences 
in 
effects, 
to 
assume 
new 
hypothetical 
causes, 
differing 
from 
any 
known 
heretofore. 
But

but

The 
several 
thoughts, 
however, 
to 
which 
these 
three 
several 
objects 
are 
revealed, 
are 
three 
ordinary 
'segments' 
of 
the 
mental 
'stream.' 


As

We 
may, 
then, 
conclude 
our 
examination 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
simple 
involuntary 
discrimination 
comes 
about, 
by 
saying, 
1) 
that 
its 
vehicleisathoughtpossessedofaknowledgeofbothtermscomparedandoftheirdifference;2)thatthenecessaryandsufficientcondition(asthe 
human 
mind

for 
arousing 
this 
thought 
is 
that 
a 
thought 
or

of 
one 
of 
the 
terms 
discriminated 
should, 
as 
immediately 
as 
possible,precedethatinwhichtheothertermisknown;and3)andthatthe

which

(or

difficult 
cases 
will

one

This

however, 
not

is 
manifestly 
one 
of 
the 
most 
incessantly 
performed 
of 
all 
our 
mental 
processes,soletusexaminetheconditionsunderwhichitoccurs. 


I 
think 
we 
may 
safely 
lay 
down 
at 
the 
outset 
this 
fundamental 
principle, 
that 
any 
total 
impression 
made 
on 
the 
mind 
must 
be 
unanalyzable, 
whose 
elements 
are 
never 
experienced

palpitating 
heart,

The

gives 
rise 
to 
bodily 
feelings; 
and 
the

TheProcessofAbstraction. 


Very 
few 
elements 
of 
reality 
are 
experienced 
by 
us 
in 
absolute 
isolation. 
The 
most 
that 
usually 
happens 
to 
a 
constituent 
a, 
of 
a 
compoundphenomenonabcd,isthatitsstrengthrelativelytobcdvariesfrom 
a 
maximum 
to 
a 
minimum; 
or 
that 
it 
appears 
linked 
with 
other 
qualities, 
in 
other 
compounds, 
as 
aefg, 
or 
ahik. 
Either 
of 
these 
vicissitudes 
in 
the 
mode 
of 
our 
experiencing 
a 
may, 
under 
favorable 
circumstances, 
lead 
us 
to 
feel 
the 
difference 
between 
it 
and 
its 
concomitants, 
and 
to 
single 
it 
out 
--not 
absolutely, 
it 
is 
true, 
but 
approximately 
--andsotoanalyzethecompoundofwhichitisapart. 
The 
act 
of 
singling 
out 
is 
then 
called 
abstraction,

And 
still 
more 
to 
the 
point 
Dr. 
Martineau, 
in 
the 
passage 
I

Mr.

appears 
to

that 
the 
mere 
fact 
that 
the 
common 
term 
is 
repeated 
more 
often 
than 
any 
one 
of

TheImprovementofDiscriminationbyPractice. 


InallthecasesconsideredhithertoIhavesupposedthedifferencesinvolvedtobesolargeastobeflagrant,andthediscrimination,wheresuccessive, 
was 
treated 
as 
involuntary. 
But, 
so 
far 
from 
being 
always 
involuntary, 
discriminations 
are 
often 
difficult 
in 
the 
extreme, 
and 
by 
most 
men 
never 
performed. 
Professor 
de 
Morgan, 
thinking, 
it 
is 
true, 
rather 
of 
conceptual 
than 
of 
perceptive 
discrimination, 
wrote, 
wittily 
enough: 


"The 
great 
bulk 
of 
the 
illogical 
part 
of 
the 
educated 
community 
-whethermajorityorminorityIknownot;
perhapssixofoneandhalfa 



dozenoftheother--havenotpowertomakeadistinction,andofcourse 
cannot 
be 
made 
to 
take 
a 
distinction, 
and 
of 
course 
never 
attempt 
to 
shakeadistinction.Withthemallsuchthingsareevasions,subterfuges, 
come-offs, 
loop-holes, 
etc. 
They 
would 
hang 
a 
man 
for 
horse-stealing 
under 
a 
statute 
against 
sheep-stealing; 
and 
would 
laugh 
at 
you 
if 
you 
quibbledaboutthedistinctionbetweenahorseandasheep."18 


Any 
personal 
or 
practical 
interest, 
however, 
in 
the 
results 
to 
be 
obtainedbydistinguishing,makesone'switsamazinglysharptodetect 
differences. 
The 
culprit 
himself 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
overlook 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
horse 
and 
a 
sheep. 
And 
long 
training 
and 
practice 
in 
distinguishing 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
as 
personal 
interest. 
Both 
of 
these 
agencies 
give 
to 
small 
amounts 
of 
objective 
difference 
the 
same 
effectivenessuponthemindthat,underothercircumstances,onlylargeoneswouldhave.

That 
'practice 
makes

is 
notorious 
in 
the 
field 
of 
motor 
accomplishments. 
But 
motor 
accomplishments 
depend 
in 
part 
on 
sensory 
discrimination.

that

to

that

in 
the 
nature 
of 
things, 
improve 
the 
delicacy 
of

have 
let

Let

To

Reaction-TimeAfterDiscrimination. 



The 
time 
required 
for 
discrimination 
has 
been 
made 
a 
subject 
of 
experimental 
measurement. 
Wundt 
calls 
it 
Unterscheidungszeit.

Herr

made

The 
times 
are 
expressed 
in

The 
interesting 
points 
here 
are 
the 
great 
individual 
variations, 
and 
the 
rapid 
way 
in 
which 
the 
time 
for 
discrimination 
increases 
with 
the 
numberofpossibletermstodiscriminate.Theindividualvariationsare 
largelyduetowantofpracticeintheparticulartaskset,butpartlyalsotodiscrepancies 
in 
the 
psychic 
process. 
One 
gentleman 
said, 
for 
example, 
that 
in 
the 
experiments 
with 
three 
sounds, 
he 
kept 
the 
image 
of 
the 
middle 
one 
ready 
in 
his 
mind,

I 
have, 
in 
describing 
these 
experiments, 
followed 
the 
example 
of 
previouswritersandspokenasiftheprocessbywhichthenatureofthesignal 
determines 
the 
reaction 
were 
identical 
with 
the 
ordinary 
conscious 
process 
of 
discriminative 
perception 
and 
volition. 
I 
am 
convinced, 
however, 
that 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case; 
and 
that 
although 
the 
results 
are 
the 
same, 
the 
form 
of 
consciousness 
is 
quite 
different. 
The 
reader 
will 
remember 
my 
contention 
(supra, 
p. 
90 
ff.) 
that 
the 
simple 
reaction-time 
(usually 
supposed 
to 
include 
a 
conscious 
process 
of 
perceiving) 
really 
measures 
nothing 
but 
a 
reflex 
act. 
Anyone 
who 
will 
performreactionswithdiscriminationwilleasilyconvincehimselfthat 



the 
process 
here 
also 
is 
far 
more 
like 
a 
reflex, 
than 
like 
a 
deliberate, 
operation. 
I 
have 
made, 
with 
myself 
and 
students, 
a 
large 
number 
of 
measurements 
where 
the 
signal 
expected 
was 
in 
one 
series 
a 
touch 
somewhere 
on 
the 
skin 
of 
the 
back 
and 
head, 
and 
in 
another 
series 
a 
sparksomewhereinthefieldofview.Thehandhadtomoveasquickly 
as 
possible 
towards 
the 
place 
of 
the 
touch 
or 
the 
spark. 
It 
did 
so 
infallibly, 
and 
sensibly 
instantly; 
whilst 
both 
place 
and 
movement 
seemed 
to 
be 
perceived 
only 
a 
moment 
later, 
in 
memory. 
These 
experiments 
were 
undertaken 
for 
the 
express 
purpose 
of 
ascertaining 
whether 
the 
movement 
at 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
spark 
was 
discharged 
immediatelybythevisualperception,orwhethera

ThePerceptionofLikeness. 


The 
perception 
of 
likeness 
is 
practically 
very 
much 
bound 
up 
with 
that 
of 
difference. 
That 
is 
to 
say, 
the 
only 
differences 
we 
note 
as 
differences, 
and 
estimate 
quantitatively, 
and 
arrange 
along 
a 
scale, 
are 
those 
comparatively 
limited 
differences 
which 
we 
find 
between 
membersofacommongenus.TheforceofgravityandthecolorofthisinkarethingsitneveroccurredtometocompareuntilnowthatIamcasting

things 
must 
as 
a 
rule 
have 
some 
commensurability, 
some 
aspect 
in

which 
suggests 
the 
possibility 
of 
their 
being 
treated 
in 
the 
sameway.Thisisofcoursenotatheoreticnecessity--foranydistinction

The

arouse 
the 
perception 
of

usuallyarousethatofresemblancealso.Andtheanalysisofthem,soas 
to 
define 
wherein 
the 
difference 
and 
wherein 
the 
resemblance 
respectively 
consists, 
is 
called 
comparison. 
If 
we 
start 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
thingsassimplythesameoralike,weareliabletobesurprisedbythedifference. 
If 
we 
start 
to 
treat 
them 
as 
merely 
different, 
we 
are 
apt 
todiscoverhowmuchtheyarealike.Difference,commonlysocalled,isthusbetween 
species 
of 
a 
genus. 
And 
the 
faculty 
by 
which 
we 
perceive 
the 
resemblance 
upon 
which 
the 
genus 
is 
based, 
is 
just 
as 
ultimate 
and 
inexplicable 
a 
mental 
endowment 
as 
that 
by 
which 
we

the

just 
as 
there 
is 
a 
shock 
of 
difference 
when 
we 
pass 
between 
two

The 
objective

of 
the

just 
like 
that 
of 
the

determines 
the

of

The

On

I 
spoke 
of 
differences 
being 
greater 
or 
less, 
and 
of 
certain 
groups 
of 
them 
being 
susceptible 
of 
a 
linear 
arrangement 
exhibiting 
serial

Andit

We 
saw 
above 
(p. 
492) 
that 
some 
persons 
consider 
that 
the 
difference 
between 
two

is 
constituted 
of 
two

viz.,

hereanytheorywhichwouldbaselikenessonidentity, 
andnotrather

must 
fail. 
It 
is 
supposed 
perhaps, 
by 
most 
people, 
that 
two 
resembling 
things 
owe 
their 
resemblance 
to 
their 
absolute 
identity 
in 
respect 
of 
some 
attribute 
or 
attributes, 
combined 
with 
the 
absolutenon-identityoftherestoftheirbeing.This,whichmaybetrueofcompoundthings,breaksdownwhenwecometosimpleimpressions.

And 
as 
all 
compound 
resemblances 
are 
based 
on 
simple 
ones 
like 
these, 
it 
follows 
that 
likeness 
überhaupt 
must 
not 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
special 
complication 
of 
identity, 
but 
rather 
that 
identity 
must 
be 
conceived 
as 
a 
special 
degree 
of 
likeness, 
according 
to 
the 
proposition 



expressed 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
paragraph 
that 
precedes. 
Likeness

As

notwo

no 
two

all 
those

are 
in 
scientific 
rigor 
identical. 
We 
call 
those 
of 
them 
identical 
whose

is 
unperceived. 
Over 
and

this 
we 
have 
a 
conception 
of

TheMeasureofDiscriminativeSensibility. 


In1860, 
ProfessorG. 
T. 
FechnerofLeipzig, 
amanofgreatlearning 
and 
subtlety 
of 
mind, 
published 
two 
volumes 
entitled 
'Psychophysik,' 
devoted 
to 
establishing 
and 
explaining 
a 
law 
called 
by 
him 
the 
psychophysiclaw,whichheconsideredtoexpressthedeepestandmostelementaryrelationbetweenthementalandthephysicalworlds.Itisa 
formula 
for 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
amount 
of 
our 
sensations 
and 
theamountoftheiroutwardcauses.Itssimplestexpressionis,thatwhen 
we 
pass 
from 
one 
sensation 
to 
a 
stronger 
one 
of 
the 
same 
kind, 
the 
sensations 
increase 
proportionally 
to 
the 
logarithms 
of 
their 
exciting 
causes. 
Fechner's 
book 
was 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
a 
new 
department 
of 
literature, 
which 
it 
would 
be 
perhaps 
impossible 
to 
match 
for 
the 
qualities 
of 
thoroughness 
and 
subtlety, 
but 
of 
which, 
in 
the 
humble 
opinionofthepresentwriter,theproperpsychologicaloutcomeisjustnothing.Thepsychophysiclawcontroversyhaspromptedagoodmanyseriesofobservationsonsense-discrimination,andhasmadediscussionof

the 
reader. 
Fechner's

have 
nothing

it 
is 
but 
just 
that 
I 
should 
quote 
an 
existing 
account. 
I 
choose 
the 
one 
given 
by 
Wundt 
in 
his 
Vorlesungen

Thenaturalmeasureof

describes 
how

Association. 


After 
discrimination, 
association! 
Already 
in 
the 
last 
chapter 
I 
have 
had 
to 
invoke, 
in 
order 
to 
explain 
the 
improvement 
of 
certain 
discriminations 
by 
practice, 
the 
'association' 
of 
the 
objects 
to 
be 
distinguished, 
withothermorewidelydifferingones. 
Itisobviousthat 
the 
advance 
of 
our 
knowledge 
must 
consist 
of 
both 
operations; 
for

Theproblem 
which 
the 
philosophers 
have 
set 
themselves 
is 
that 
of 
ascertaining 
principles 
of 
connection 
between 
the 
thoughts 
which 
thus 
appear 
to 
sprout 
one 
out 
of 
the 
other, 
whereby 
their 
peculiar 
succession 
or 
coexistencemaybeexplained. 


But 
immediately 
an 
ambiguity 
arises: 
which 
sort 
of 
connection 
is 
meant?connectionthought-of, 
or 
connectionbetweenthoughts? 
Thesearetwoentirelydifferentthings,andonlyinthecaseofoneofthemisthereanyhopeoffinding'principles.'Thejungleofconnectionsthought

andRenouviercallthe 
'categories' 
of 
the 
understanding.2 
According 
as 
we 
followed 
one 
category 
or 
another 
we 
should 
sweep, 
with 
our 
thought, 
through 
the 
world 
in 
this 
way 
or 
in 
that. 
And 
all 
the 
categories 
would 
be 
logical, 
would 
be 
relations 
of 
reason. 
They 
would 
fuse 
the 
items 
into 
a 
continuum. 
Were 
this 
the 
sort 
of 
connection 
sought 
between 
one 
momentofourthinkingandanother,ourchaptermightendhere.Fortheonlysummarydescriptionoftheseinfinitepossibilitiesoftransition, 
is 
that 
they 
are 
all 
acts

that

Practically 
it

suggestive 
fact 
that 
Locke,

many 
more

Continental 
psychologists, 
have 
found 
themselves 
obliged 
to 
invoke 
a

But

The 
time-measuring 
psychologists 
of 
recent 
days 
have 
tried 
their 
hand 
at 
this 
problem 
by 
more 
elaborate 
methods. 
Galton, 
using 
a 
very 
simple 
apparatus, 
found 
that 
the 
sight 
of 
an 
unforeseen 
word 
would 
awakenanassociated'idea'inabout5/6ofasecond.4Wundtnextmade

--Finally, 
Mr. 
Cattell 
made 
some 
interestingobservationsupontheassociation-timebetweenthelookoflettersandtheir

"I

says,

of 
experiments, 
the 
writer 
found 
that 
he 
had 
read 
words 
not

sentences 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
1/4 
sec., 
words 
making

(a 
passage 
from 
Swift) 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
1/8 
sec., 
per 
word. 
. 
. 
. 
The 
rate 
at 
which 
a 
person 
reads 
a 
foreign 
language 
is 
proportional 
to 
his 
familiarity 
with 



thelanguage.Forexample,whenreadingasfastaspossiblethewriter's

Experiments 
made 
on 
others 
strikingly 
confirm 
these 
results. 
The 
subject 
does 
not 
know 
that

is

In

the

be

But 
as

Hamilton 
first 
used 
the 
word 
'redintegration' 
to 
designate 
all 
association. 
Such 
processes 
as 
we 
have 
just 
described 
might 
in 
an 



emphatic 
sense 
be 
termed 
redintegrations, 
for 
they 
would 
necessarily 
lead, 
if 
unobstructed, 
to 
the 
reinstatement 
in 
thought 
of 
the 
entire 
content 
of 
large 
trains 
of 
past 
experience. 
From 
this 
complete 
redintegration 
there 
could 
be 
no 
escape 
save 
through 
the 
irruption 
of 
somenewandstrongpresentimpressionofthesenses,orthroughtheexcessive 
tendency 
of 
some 
one 
of 
the 
elementary 
brain-tracts 
to 
dischargeindependentlyintoanaberrantquarterofthebrain.Suchwas 
thetendencyoftheword'heir'intheversefrom'LocksleyHall,'which

Let 
us 
call 
this 
process 
impartial 
redintegration. 
Whether 
it 
ever 
occurs 
in 
an 
absolutely 
complete 
form 
is 
doubtful. 
We 
all 
immediatelyrecognize,however,thatinsomemindsthereisamuchgreatertendencythan

Perhaps 
as 
successful 
a 
rendering 
as 
any 
of 
this 
mental 
type 
is 
the 
character 
of 
Miss 
Bates 
in 
Miss 
Austen's 
'Emma.' 
Hear 
how 
she 
redintegrates: 


"'But

cried 
Miss 
Bates. 
'Where

in

there

This

us 
to

it 
is 
that

our

focalized 
itself 
upon 
a

AssociationbySimilarity. 



In 
partial 
or 
mixed 
associations 
we 
have 
all 
along 
supposed 
the 
interesting 
portion 
of 
the 
disappearing 
thought 
to 
be 
of 
considerable 
extent, 
andtobesufficientlycomplextoconstitutebyitself 
aconcrete 
object. 
Sir 
WilliamHamiltonrelates, 
forinstance, 
that 
after 
thinkingof 
Ben 
Lomond 
he 
found 
himself 
thinking 
of 
the 
Prussian 
system 
of 
education, 
and 
discovered 
that 
the 
links 
of 
association 
were 
a 
German 
gentleman 
whom 
he 
had 
met 
on 
Ben 
Lomond, 
Germany, 
etc. 
The 
interesting 
part 
of 
Ben 
Lomond, 
as 
he 
had 
experienced 
it, 
the 
partoperativeindeterminingthetrainofhisideaswasthecompleximageof 
a 
particular 
man. 
But 
now 
let 
us 
suppose 
that 
that 
selective 
agency 
of 
interested 
attention, 
which 
may 
thus 
convert 
impartial 
redintegration 
intopartialassociation--letussupposethatitrefinesitselfstillfurther

so 
small 
asto

butonlyofanabstractqualityor

Let 
us 
moreover 
suppose 
that 
the 
part 
thus 
accentuated 
persists 
in 
consciousness 
(or, 
in 
cerebral 
terms,

The 
pair 
of 
thoughts 
will 
form 
an 
instance 
of 
what 
is 
called 
'AssociationbySimilarity.'22 


The 
similars 
which 
are 
here 
associated, 
or 
of 
which 
the 
first 
is 
followed 
by 
the 
second 
in 
the 
mind, 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
compounds.

The

is 
partial

The 
gradual 
passage 
from 
impartial 
redintegration 
to 
similar 
association 
through 
what 
we 
have 
called 
ordinary 
mixed

may 
be 
symbolized 
by

This

itself 
an 
excellent

the

an

The

whenever

to

the

which 
we

SimilarityNoElementaryLaw. 


Such 
is 
the 
analysis 
I 
propose, 
first 
of 
the 
three 
main 
types 
of 
spontaneous 
association, 
and 
then 
of 
voluntary 
association. 
It 
will 
be 
observedthattheobjectcalledupmaybearanylogicalrelationwhatevertotheonewhichsuggestedit.Thelawrequiresonlythatonecondition 
should 
be 
fulfilled. 
The 
fading

must 
be 
due

brain-processsomeofwhoseelementsawakenthroughhabitsomeoftheelementsofthebrain-processoftheobjectwhichcomestoview.Thisawakeningistheoperativemachinery,thecausalagency,throughout,quiteasmuchsointhekindofassociationIhavecalledbythenameofSimilarity, 
asin 
any 
other 
sort. 
The 
similarity 
between 
the 
objects, 
or 
between 
the 
thoughts 
(if 
similarity 
there 
be 
between 
these 
latter), 
has 
no 
causal 
agencyincarryingusfromonetotheother.Itisbutaresult--theeffect 
of 
the 
usual 
causal 
agent 
when 
this 
happens 
to 
work 
in 
a 
certain 
particular 
and 
assignable 
way. 
But 
ordinary 
writers 
talk 
as 
if 
the 
similarityoftheobjectswereitselfanagent,co-ordinatewithhabit,andindependentofit,andlikeitabletopushobjectsbeforethemind.Thisis 
quiteunintelligible.

There 
are, 
nevertheless, 
able 
writers 
who 
not 
only 
insist 
on 
preserving 
association 
by 
similarity 
as 
a 
distinct 
elementary 
law, 
but 
who 
make 
it 
the 
most 
elementary 
law, 
and 
seek 
to 
derive 
contiguous 



association 
from 
it. 
Their 
reasoning 
is 
as 
follows: 
When 
the 
presentimpressionAawakenstheideabofitspastcontiguousassociateB,howcanthisoccurexceptthroughfirstrevivinganimageaofitsownpast 
occurrence. 
This 
is 
the 
term 
directly 
connected 
with 
b; 
so 
that 
the 
process 
instead 
of 
being 
simply 
A 
--b 
is 
A 
--a 
--b. 
Now 
A 
and 
a 
are 
similars;thereforenoassociationbycontiguitycanoccurexceptthrough 
a 
previous 
association 
by 
similarity. 
The 
most 
important 
supposition 
here 
made 
is 
that 
every 
impression 
on 
entering 
the 
mind 
must 
needs 
awakenanimageofitspastself,inthelightofwhichitis'apperceived'or 
understood, 
and 
through 
the 
intermediation 
of 
which 
it 
enters 
into 
relation 
with 
the 
mind's 
other 
objects. 
This 
assumption 
is 
almost 
universallymade;andyetitishardtofindanygoodreasonforit.Itfirst 
camebeforeuswhenwewerereviewingthefactsofaphasiaandmentalblindness(seep.50ff.).Butwethensawnoneedofopticalandauditoryimagestointerpretopticalandauditorysensationsby.Onthecontrary,

the 
reproduction

object 
contrasting 
with 
one 
already 
in 
the 
mind 
is 



easily 
explained 
on 
our 
principles. 
Recent 
writers, 
in 
fact, 
all 
reduce 
it 
either 
to 
similarity 
or 
contiguity.

The 
law 
of 
accidental 
prepotency 
of 
certain 
processes 
over 
others 
falls 
also 
within 
the 
sphere 
of 
cerebral 
probabilities. 
Granting 
such 
instability 
as 
the 
brain-tissue 
requires, 
certain 
points 
must 
always 
discharge 
more 
quickly 
and 
strongly 
than 
others; 
and 
this 
prepotency 
would 
shift 
its 
place 
from

accidental 
causes,

the 
problem 
ofthe 
successionof 
ourthoughts. 
He 
writesinLeviathan, 
chapter 
III, 
as 
follows: 
"By 
consequence, 
or 
train 
of

I 
understandthatsuccessionofonethoughttoanotherwhichiscalled,todistinguish 
it 
from

not

The 
reason 
whereof 
is 
this. 
All 
fancies 
are 
motions 
within 
us, 
relics 
of 
those 
made 
in 
the

This 
train 
of 
thoughts, 
or 
mental 
discourse, 
is 
of 
two 
sorts. 
The

is

'Tis

that 
in 
the

of 
our

in

An 
eminent 
French 
psychologist, 
M. 
Ribot, 
repeats 
Hume's 
comparisonofthelawofassociationwiththatofgravitation,andgoesontosay: 


"It

this, 
then, 
in 
common 
with 
many 
other 
discoveries: 
it 
came 
late 
and 
seemssosimplethatitmayjustlyastonishus. 


"Perhaps 
it 
is 
not 
superfluous 
to 
ask 
in 
what 
this 
manner 
of 



explanation 
is 
superior 
to 
the 
current 
theory 
of 
Faculties.36 
The 
most 
extendedusageconsists,asweknow,individingintellectualphenomenaintoclasses,inseparatingthosewhichdiffer,ingroupingtogetherthoseof 
the 
same 
nature 
and 
in 
giving 
to 
these 
a 
common 
name 
and 
in 
attributing 
them 
to 
the 
same 
cause; 
it 
is 
thus 
that 
we 
have 
come 
to 
distinguish 
those 
diverse 
aspects 
of 
intelligence 
which 
are 
called 
judgment, 
reasoning, 
abstraction, 
perception, 
etc. 
This 
method 
is 
precisely 
the 
one 
followed 
in 
Physics, 
where 
the 
words 
caloric, 
electricity, 
gravity, 
designate 
the 
unknown 
causes 
of 
certain 
groups 
of 
phenomena.Ifonethusneverforgetsthatthediversefacultiesareonly 
the 
unknown 
causes 
of

phenomena, 
that 
they 
are 
simply 
a 
convenient 
means 
of 
classifying 
the 
facts 
and 
speaking 
of 
them, 
if 
one 
does 
not 
fall 
into 
the 
common 
fault 
of 
making 
out 
of 
them 
substantial 
entities, 
creations

his 
is 
an

Between 
the 
psychologywhichtracesintellectualfactsbacktocertainfaculties, 
and 
that 
which 
reduces 
them 
to 
the

of

there 
is, 
according 
to 
our

retain 
both 
Resemblance

Contiguity 
as

are 
by 
him 
regarded 
as 
constituting 
all

His

a

When 
it 
first 
occurred 
to 
a 
reflecting 
mind 
that 
moving 
water 
had 
a 
property 
identical 
with 
human 
or 
brute 
force, 
namely, 
the 
property 
of 
setting

It 
may 
seem 
to 
the 
modern 
understanding,
familiarwithwater-wheelsanddriftingrafts,thatthesimilarityherewas 
an 
extremely 
obvious 
one. 
But 
if 
we

we

an

The

was 
too 
great 
to 
be 
broken 
through 
by 
such 
a 
faint 
and 
limited 
amount 
of

In 
one 
mind, 
however, 
theidentificationdid 
take 
place,

followed

It

the

Similarity 
in 
general; 
the 
tendency 
to 
detect 
likeness 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
disparity 
and

This 
supposition 
accounts 
for 
the 
fact, 
and 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
known 
intellectual 
character 
of 
theinventor 
of

Dr. 
Hodgson's 
account 
of 
association 
is 
by 
all 
odds 
the 
best 
yetpropoundedinEnglish.43Allthesewritersholdmoreorlessexplicitlytothe

to 
have

supreme 
in

For 
Herbart 
each 
idea 
is 
a 
permanentlyexistingentity,theentrancewhereofintoconsciousnessisbut 
an 
accidental 
determination 
of 
its

So 
far 
as 
it

Herr 
Lipps, 
the 
most 
recent 
systematic 
German 
Psychologist, 
has, 
I 
regret 
to 
say, 
carried 
out 
the 
theory 
of 
ideas 
in 
a 
way 
which 
the 
great 
originality, 
learning, 
and 
acutenessheshowsmakeonlythemoreregrettable.46Suchelaborately 



artificial 
constructions 
are, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
only 
a 
burden 
and 
a 
hindrance,notahelp,toourscience.47 


In 
French, 
M. 
Rabier 
in 
his 
chapter 
on 
Association,48 
handles 
the 
subject 
more 
vigorously 
and 
acutely 
than 
any 
one.

In

of

immense

The 
theory 
propounded 
in 
this 
chapter, 
and 
a 
good 
many 
pages 
of 
the 
text, 
were 
originallypublishedinthePopularScienceMonthlyforMarch,1880.

"owing

Moreover, 
a 
substantive 
standing 
by 
itself 
is 
usually 
the 
equivalent 
of 
too 
abstract 
an 
idea 
for 
us 
to 
conceive 
properly 
without 
delay. 
Thus 
it 
is 
very 
difficult 
to 
get 
a 
quick 
conception 
of 
the 
word 
'carriage,' 
because 
there 
are 
so 
many 
different 
kinds 
--two-wheeled, 



four-wheeled, 
open 
and 
closed, 
and 
in 
so 
many 
different 
possible 
positions, 
that 
the 
mind 
possibly 
hesitates

an 
obscure

This 
value 
is 
much 
smaller 
than 
that 
got 
by 
Wundt 
as 
above. 
No 
reason 
for 
the 
difference 
is 
suggested 
by 
Mr. 
Cattell. 
Wundt 
calls 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
figures 
found 
by 
him 
give 
an 
average,
0.720",exactlyequaltothetimeintervalwhichinhisexperiments(videinfra,chapteronTime)wasreproducedwithouterroreitherway,andtothat 
required, 
according 
to 
the 
Webers,

in 
rapid 
locomotion."Itisnotimprobable,"headds,"thatthispsychicconstant,of

we

to 
subdivide 
rhythmically 
longer 
periods 
of 
time." 
(Physiol. 
Psch., 
II. 
286). 
The 
rapprochement 
is 
of 
that 
tentative 
sort 
which 
it 
is 
no 
harm 
for 
psychologists 
to 
make, 
provided 
they 
recollect 
howveryfictitiousandincomparablemutuallyalltheseaveragesderivedfrom

persecution 
and

it 
was 
twice 
as 
great 
as 
normal 
(1.39" 
instead 
of 
0.7"). 
This 
latter 
patient's 
time 
was 
six-fold 
that 
of 
the 
paralytic. 
Herr 
von 
Tschisch 
remarks 
on 
the

the 
short

The

in

differs 
from 
these 
in

Mr.

on

that 
it

only 
be

In

the 
practically 
cognized 
present 
is 
no 
knife-edge, 
but 
a 
saddle-back,withacertainbreadthofitsownonwhichwesitperched,

from

directions 
into

The

and 
to

First 
of 
all, 
we 
note 
a 
marked 
difference 
between 
the 
elementary 
sensations 
of 
duration 
and 
those 
of 
space. 
The 
former 
have 
a 
much 
narrower 
range; 
the 
time-sense 
may 
be 
called 
a 
myopic 
organ, 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
eye, 
for 
example. 
The 
eye 
sees 
rods, 
acres, 
even 
miles,atasingleglance,andthesetotalsitcanafterwardsubdivideinto 



an 
almost 
infinite

Hearing 
is 
the 
sense 
by 
which 
the 
subdivision 
of 
durations 
is 
most 
sharplymade. 
Almostalltheexperimentalworkonthetime-sensehasbeendonebymeansofstrokesofsound.

Whenever 
we 
thus

form,wecanidentifyalongerstringofthemwithoutconfusion. 


Each 
variety 
of

for

has 
its 
'law';

Butthesesuperposed 



systems 
of

soon 
reach 
their 
limit. 
In 
music, 
as 
Wundt6 
says,
"whilethemeasuremayeasilycontain12changesofintensityofsound(asin12/8time), 
therhythmicalgroupmayembrace6measures, 
and 
theperiodconsistof4,exceptionallyof5 


[8?]groups." 


Wundt 
and 
his 
pupil 
Dietze 
have 
both 
tried 
to 
determine 
experimentally 
the 
maximal 
extent 
of 
our 
immediate 
distinct 
consciousnessforsuccessiveimpressions.

The 
maximum 
unfilled, 
or 
vacant 
duration, 
seems 
to 
lie 
within 
the 
same 
objective 
range. 
Estel 
and 
Mehner, 
also 
working 
in 
Wundt's 
laboratory,foundittovaryfrom5or6to12seconds,andperhapsmore.

Thesefiguresmayberoughlytakentostandforthemostimportantpart 
of 
what, 
with 
Mr. 
Clay, 
we 
called, 
a 
few 
pages 
back, 
the 
specious 
present. 
The 
specious 
present 
has, 
in 
addition, 
a 
vaguely 
vanishing 
backward 
and 
forward 
fringe; 
but 
its 
nucleus 
is 
probably 
the 
dozen 
secondsorlessthathavejustelapsed. 



If 
these 
are 
the 
maximum, 
what, 
then, 
is 
the 
minimum 
amount 
of 
durationwhichwecandistinctlyfeel? 


The 
smallest 
figure 
experimentally 
ascertained 
was 
by 
Exner, 
who 
distinctly 
heard 
the 
doubleness 
of 
two 
successive 
clicks 
of 
a 
Savart's 
wheel, 
and 
of 
two 
successive 
snaps 
of 
an 
electric 
spark, 
when 
their 
intervalwasmadeassmallasabout1/500ofasecond.11 


With 
the 
eye, 
perception 
is 
less 
delicate. 
Two

experimented 
with 
a 
modified 
Savart's 
wheel, 
which 
gave 
clicks 
in 
varyingnumberandatvaryingintervals,says:13 


"In 
order 
that 
their 
discontinuity 
may 
be 
clearly 
perceived, 
four 
or 
even 
three 
clicks 
or

must 
be 
farther 
apart 
than 
two

to

Whentwoareeasilydistinguished,threeorfourseparatedbythesameinterval

. 
.

often 
confidently 
pronounced 
to

It 
would 
be 
well 
if 
observations 
were 
so 
directed 
as 
to 
ascertain,atleastuptotenortwenty,theincrease[ofinterval]requiredby 
each 
additional 
click 
in 
a 
series 
for 
the 
sense 
of

to

Where 
the

falls

one 
sense, 
and 
the

on

all 
the

which 
seemed 
to 
him 
either

or 
fast 
in 
the

He 
thought 
thus 
that 
deviations 
of 
about 
1/100

a 
second 
either

were 
correctly 
noticed 
by 
him 
at 
the

The

was 
here 
0.1840". 
Hall 
and 
Jastrow 
listened 
to 
the 
intervals 
between 
the 
clicks 
of 
their 
apparatus. 
Between 
two 
such 
equal 
intervals 
of 
4.27" 
each, 
a 
middle 
interval 
was 
included, 
which 
might 
be 
made 
either 
shorter 
or 
longer 
than 
the 
extremes."Aftertheserieshadbeenheardtwooreventhreetimes,noimpressionoftherelativelengthofthemiddleintervalwouldoftenexist,

Inserting

greatly 
facilitated

in

Our 
sense 
of 
time, 
like 
other 
senses, 
seems 
subject 
to 
the 
law 
of

It

Like 
other 
senses, 
too, 
our 
sense 
of

is 
sharpened 
by 
practice. 
Mehner 
ascribes

There 
is 
a 
certain 
emotional

accompanying 
the

as

in

varying 
from 
40 
to 
200 
a

and 
found 
that 
they 
very 
naturally 
fell 
into 
seven 
categories, 
from 
'very 
slow' 
to 
'very

Each 
category 
of 
feeling 
included 
the 
intervals 
following

within 
a

of

and 
no

There

under

no

the

the 
pure

of

budding,

it

and 
growing

Is 
this 
really

not? 
The

Wundt

somewhere 
called 
the

of 
our

Our

our 
breathing, 
the

of 
our

fragments 
of

And 
along

of

its

goes 
the

of 
the

a

spent 
in 
rapid 
and 
interesting 
travel, 
are 
of 
something 
intricate, 
multitudinous, 
and 
long-
drawn-out. 
But 
as 
each 
passing 
year 
converts 
some 
of 
this 
experience 
into 
automatic 
routine 
which 
we

If 
asked 
why 
we 
perceive 
the 
light 
of 
the 
sun, 
or 
the 
sound 
of 
an 
explosion, 
we 
reply, 
"Because

says 
Helmholtz, 
in 
whichsuchcopyingoccurs,andinwhich 


"our

can 
truly 
correspond 
with

is 
that 
of 
the 
time-succession 
of

Simultaneity,

the

One 
experiences 
an 
almost 
instinctive 
impulse, 
in 
pursuing 
such

as 
these,

say, 
than 
that 
the

and

of

should 
become 
known? 
The 
succession 
of 
the 
outer 
forces 
stamps 
itself 
as 
a 
like 
succession 
upon 
the 
brain. 
The

still, 
between 
the

lies 
as

I 
have 
shown, 
at 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
article, 
that 
what 
is 
past, 
to 
be 
known 
as 
past, 
must 
be 
known 
with 
what 
is 
present,

Thelengthofthisperpendicular

Some

we

simply 
by

tossing 
them 
into 
the

So 
in

we 
think

of

aim 
at 
is 
to 
state 
the 
most 
elemental 
form 
of 
the 
psycho-physical 
conjunction. 


I 
have 
assumed 
that 
the 
brain-processes 
are 
sensational 
ones. 
Processes 
of 
active 
attention 
(see 
Mr. 
Ward's 
account 
in 
the 
long 
footnote) 
will 
leave 
similar 
fading 
brain-processes 
behind. 
If 
the 
mental 
processesareconceptual,acomplicationisintroducedofwhichIwillin 
a

speak. 
Meanwhile, 
still 
speaking 
of 
sensational 
processes,

--e.g.asightandasound--aregivenatonceornearlyatonce,wehavedifficultyinattendingtoboth,andmaywronglyjudgetheirinterval,or 
even 
invert 
their 
order. 
Now, 
as 
the 
result 
of 
his 
experiments 
on 
such 
stimuli, 
Wundt 
lays 
down 
this 
law:48 
that 
of 
the 
three 
possible 
determinationswemaymakeoftheirorder-


"namely, 
simultaneity, 
continuous 
transition, 
and 
discontinuous 
transition 
--only 
the 
first 
and 
last 
are 
realized, 
never 
the 
second. 



Invariably,whenwefailtoperceivetheimpressionsassimultaneous,wenotice

shorter 
or 
longer 
empty 
time 
between 
them, 
which 
seems 
to 
correspondtothesinkingofoneoftheideasandtotheriseoftheother.. 
. 
. 
For 
our 
attention 
may 
share 
itself 
equally 
between 
the 
two 
impressions, 
which 
will 
then 
compose 
one 
total 
percept 
[and

the 
events 
are 
perceived 
as 
two, 
and 
in 
successive 
order 
--that 
is, 
as 
separated 
by 
a 
time-interval 
in 
which

is 
not 
sufficientlyaccommodatedtoeithertobringadistinctperceptionabout. 
...While 
we 
are 
hurrying 
from 
one 
to 
the 
other, 
everything 
between 
them 
vanishesinthetwilightofgeneralconsciousness."49 


One 
might 
call 
this 
the 
law 
of 
discontinuous 
succession 
in 
time, 
of 
percepts 
to 
which 
we 
cannot 
easily 
attend 
at 
once. 
Each

--wherever 
and 
from 
whatever 
causeitmayoccur. 


To 
pass, 
now, 
to 
conceptual 
processes: 
Suppose 
I 
think 
of 
the 
Creation, 
then 
of 
the 
Christian 
era, 
then 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Waterloo, 
all 
within 
a 
few 
seconds. 
These 
matters 
have 
their 
dates 
far 
outside 
the 
specious 
present. 
The 
processes 
by 
which 
I 
think 
them, 
however, 
all 
overlap.Whatevents,then,doesthespeciouspresentseemtocontain? 
Simply 
my 
successive 
acts 
of 
thinking 
these 
long-past 
things, 
not 
the 
long-pastthingsthemselves.Astheinstantly-presentthoughtmaybeofalong-past 
thing, 
so 
the 
just-past 
thought 
may 
be 
of 
another 
long-past 
thing. 
Whenalong-pasteventisreproducedinmemoryandconceivedwith 
its 
date, 
the 
reproduction 
and 
conceiving 
traverse 
the 
specious 
present. 
The 
immediate 
content 
of 
the 
latter 
is 
thus 
all 
my 
direct 
experiences,whethersubjectiveorobjective.

which

As

the

any

of 
events 
to 
that 
of 
these 
experiences, 
so 
we 
suppose

of

Von

has 
indulged52 
in 
some 
interesting 
computations 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
such

in 
changingtheaspectofNature.Supposewewereable,withinthelengthofasecond,tonote10,000eventsdistinctly,insteadofbarely10,asnow;

That

may 
be 
realized 
somewhere 
in

saysMrSpencer,53 
"maketenorfifteenthousand

In 
hashish-intoxication 
there 
is 
a 
curious 
increase 
in 
the 
apparent 
time-perspective.

"What

myself 
of, 
or 
not 
have 
in

if 
I 
have 
consciousness 
at

is 
a 
sequence 
of 
different 
feelings.

The

of

whether

of 
a

or 
of 
a

the

the

involved 
in

The 
Germans 
lengthened

shortened 
those

With

this

Münsterberg 
has 
studied 
carefullyinhisowncasethevariationsoftherespiratoryfactor.Theyaremany; 
but 
he 
sums 
up 
his 
experience 
by 
saying 
that 
whether 
he 
measuredbyinspirationsthatweredividedbymomentarypausesintosixparts,orbyinspirationsthatwerecontinuous;whetherwithsensorytension

Some

46Mostoftheseexplanationssimplygivethesignswhich,adhering

date 
them 
within 
a

in 
other 
words, 
to 
assign 
to 
them 
their 
order. 
Why 
it 
should 
be 
a 
time-order, 
however, 
is 
not 
explained. 
Herbart's 
would-be 
explanation 
is 
a 
simple 
description 
of 
time-perception. 
He 
says 
it 
comes 
when, 
with 
the 
last 
member 
of 
a 
series 
present 
to 
our 
consciousness, 
we 
also 
think 
of

115;Lehrb.zurPsychol.,&sect;&sect;171,172,175).SimilarlyDrobisch, 
who 
adds 
that 
the 
series 
must 
appear 
as 
one 
already 
elapsed 
(durchlaufene), 
a 
word 
which 
shows 
even 
more 
clearly 
the 
questionbeggingnatureofthissortofaccount(
EmpirischePsychol.,&sect;59).
Th. 
Waitz 
is 
guilty 
of 
similar 
question-begging 
when 
he 
explains 
our 
time-consciousnesstobeengenderedbyasetofunsuccessfulattemptsto

(Lehrb.

account

"Sensations

that 
the

With 
the 
movement 
itself 
when 
the 
direction 
of 
attention 
changes, 
we 
are

By

Nevertheless, 
Mr. 
Ward 
does 
not 
call 
our 
feeling 
of 
this 
movement 
of 
attention 
the 
original 
of 
our 
feeling 
of 
time, 
or 
its 
brainprocessthebrain-
processwhichdirectlycausesustoperceivetime.He 
says,amomentlater,that"thoughthefixationofattentiondoesofcourse 
reallyoccupyrime, 
itisprobablynotinthefirstinstanceperceivedas 
time--i.e.ascontinuous'protensity,'touseatermofHamilton's--butas 
intensity. 
Thus, 
if 
this 
supposition 
be 
true, 
there 
is 
an 
element 
in 
our 
concretetime-perceptionswhichhasnoplaceinourabstractconceptionof 
Time. 
In 
Time 
physically 
conceived 
there 
is 
no 
trace 
of 
intensity; 
in 
time 
psychically 
experienced, 
duration 
is 
primarily 
an 
intensive 
magnitude, 
and 
so 
far 
literally 
a 
perception." 
Its 
'original' 
is, 
then, 
if 
I 
understand 
Mr. 
Ward, 
something 
like 
a 
feeling 
which 
accompanies, 
as 
pleasure 
and 
pain 
may 
accompany, 
the 
movements 
of 
attention. 
Its 
brain-processmust,itwouldseem,beassimilatedingeneraltypetothebrain-processes

and

Such 
would

In 
the

attention 
is 
kept 
incessantly 
on 
the 
move;

Locke

and 
longer

under-estimated. 
I 
takethistobeevidenceofthetimeoccupiedinaccommodatingorfixingattention."Alludingtothefactthataseriesofexperiences,abcde,mayseemshortinretrospect,whichseemedeverlastinginpassing,hesays:
"What

in

is 
the 
series 
a

c 
d 
e, 
etc.; 
what 
tells

is 
the 
intervening

etc., 
or 
rather 
the

concludesthus:"Weseemtohaveproofthatourperceptionofduration 
rests 
ultimately 
upon 
quasi-motor 
objects 
of 
varying 
intensity, 
the 
durationofwhichwedonotdirectlyexperienceasdurationatall." 


Wundt 
also 
thinks 
that 
the 
interval 
of 
about 
three-fourths 
of 
a 
second, 
which 
is 
estimated 
with 
the 
minimum 
of 
error, 
points 
to 
a 
connection 
between 
the 
time-feeling 
and 
the 
succession 
of 
distinctly 
'apperceived' 
objects 
before 
the 
mind. 
The 
'association-time' 
is 
also 
equal 
to 
about 
three 
fourths 
of 
a 
second. 
This 
association-time 
he 
regards 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
internal 
standard 
of 
duration 
to 
which 
we 
involuntarilyassimilateallintervalswhichwetrytoreproduce,bringingshorter 
ones 
up 
to

and 
longer 
ones 
down. 
[In 
the 
Stevens 
result 
we 
shouldhavetosaycontrastinsteadofassimilate,forthelongerintervalsthere 
seem 
longer, 
and 
the 
shorter 
ones 
shorter 
still.] 
"Singularly 
enough," 
he 
adds 
(Physiol. 
Psych., 
II. 
286), 
"this 
time 
is 
about 
that

Finally,Prof.Machmakesasuggestionmorespecificstill.Aftersaying 
very

Thefirstpointtobenoticedisthatforastateofmindtosurviveinmemory

In

call

An 
indelibly-imprinted 
pain 
may 
color 
a 
life; 
but, 
as 
Professor 
Richet 
says: 
"Tosufferforonlyahundredthofasecondisnottosufferatall;

Not 
that 
a 
momentary 
state 
of 
consciousness 
need 
be 
practically 
resultless.

from

In 
every 
sphere 
of 
sense, 
an 
intermittent 
stimulus, 
often 
enough 
repeated, 
produces 
a 
continuous 
sensation. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
afterimage 
of 
the 
impression 
just 
gone 
by 
blends 
with 
the 
new 
impression 
coming 
in. 
The 
effects 
of 
stimuli 
may 
thus 
be 
superposed 
upon 
each 
other 
many 
stages

Richet 
'elementary

I 
much 
prefer 
to 
reserve 
the 
word 
memory 
for 
the 
conscious 
phenomenon. 
What 
happens 
in 
the 
nerve-tissue 
is 
but 
an 
example 
of 
that 
plasticity 
or 
of 
semi-inertness,

the 
original 
form, 
which, 
in 
Chapter

we 
saw 
to 
be 
the 
groundwork 
of

The 
first 
condition 
which 
makes 
a

susceptible 
of

after

is 
that 
the

A 
certain 
length 
of 
stimulation 
seems 
demanded 
by 
the 
inertia 
of 
the 
nerve-substance. 
Exposed 
to 
a 
shorter 
influence, 
its 
modification 
fails 
to 
'set,' 
and 
it 
retains 
no 
effective 
tendency 
to 
fall 
again 
into 
the 
same 
form 
of

All 
men 
invariably 
employ 
the

expedient. 
They 
endeavor 
to 
form 
an 
association 
between 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
thing 
to 
be 
remembered, 
and 
some 
sensation,

some

which

To

Thehandkerchiefbeingseen,theknotis

its 
associates.Themachineryofrecallisthusthesameasthemachineryofassociation,andthemachineryofassociation,asweknow,isnothingbut

And 
this 
same 
law 
of 
habit 
is 
the 
machinery 
of 
retention 
also. 
Retentionmeansliabilitytorecall,anditmeansnothingmorethansuchliability. 
The 
only 
proof 
of 
there 
being 
retention 
is 
that

Whatever 
accidental

in 
the 
organized 
neural

by

at

(or 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
'retention' 
of 
the 
experience) 
is 
neither 
more 
nor 
less 
then 
the 
brain-
paths 
which 
associate 
the 
experience 
with 
the 
occasion 
and 
cue 
of 
the 
recall. 
When

these

are 
the

The

It 
is 
not 
a 
fact 
of 
the 
mental 
order 
at 
all. 
It 
is 
a 
purely 
physical 
phenomenon, 
a 
morphological 
feature, 
the 
presence 
of 
these 
'paths,' 
namely, 
in 
the 
finest 
recesses 
of 
the 
brain's 
tissue. 
The 
recall 
or 
recollection, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
a 
psychophysical 
phenomenon, 
with 
both 
a 
bodily 
and 
a 
mental 
side. 
The 
bodily 
side 
is 
the 
functional 
excitement 
of 
the 
tracts 
and 
paths 
in 
question; 
the 
mental 
side 
is 
the 
conscious 
vision 
of 
the 
past 
occurrence, 
and 
the 
belief 
that 
we 



experienceditbefore. 


Thesehabit-wornpathsofassociationareaclearrenderingofwhatauthors

by 
'predispositions,' 
'vestiges,' 
'traces,' 
etc., 
left 
in 
the 
brainbypastexperience.Mostwritersleavethenatureofthesevestiges 
vague; 
few 
think 
of 
explicitly 
assimilating 
them 
to 
channels 
of 
association.Dr.Maudsley,forexample,writes: 


"When

The 
question 
then 
suggests 
itself, 
What 
is 
the 
physical 
condition 
of 
this 
consciousness? 
What 
is 
the

is 
not

In 
a 
system, 
every 
fact 
is 
connected 
with 
every 
other 
by 
some 
thought-relation. 
The 
consequence 
is 
that 
every

is 
retained

strengtheninghismemory. 


"Mymemorywasasieve. 
Icouldremembernothing. 
Dates, 
names, 
appointments, 
faces 
--everything 
escaped 
me. 
I 
said 
to 
my 
wife, 
'Catherine, 
I 
shall 
never 
make 
a 
successful 
politician, 
for 
I 
cannot

must 
train

So 
when 
I 
came 
home 
that 
night, 
I 
sat 
down 
aloneandspentfifteenminutestryingsilentlytorecallwithaccuracytheprincipal 
events 
of

I 
could 
remember 
but 
little 
at

I

Aftera 
fewdays'practiceIfoundIcouldrecallmore. 
Eventscamebacktome 
moreminutely, 
moreaccurately, 
andmorevividlythanatfirst. 
Aftera 
fortnight 
or 
so 
ofthis, 
Catherine 
said, 
'Why 
don't 
you 
relate 
to 
me 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day, 
instead 
of 
recalling 
them 
to 
yourself? 
It 
would 
be 
interesting, 
and 
my 
interest 
in 
it 
would 
be 
a 
stimulus 
to 
you.' 
Having 
greatrespectformywife'sopinion,Ibeganahabitoforalconfession,asitwere,whichwascontinuedforalmostfiftyyears.Everynight,thelast 
thing 
before

I 
told 
her 
everything 
I 
could 
remember 
that 
had 
happened 
to 
me 
or 
about 
me 
during 
the 
day. 
I 
generally 
recalled

foundIcouldsaymylessonsbetterandbettereveryyear,andinsteadofthepracticegrowingirksome,itbecameapleasuretogooveragaintheevents

I 
am 
indebted 
to 
this 
discipline 
for 
a 
memory 
of 
somewhat 
unusual 
tenacity, 
and 
I 
recommend 
the 
practice 
to 
all 
who 
wish 
to 
store 
up 
facts, 
or 
expect 
to 
have 
much 
to 
do 
with 
influencing

I 
do 
not

that

All 
improvement 
of

consists, 
then, 
in 
the 
improvement 
of 
one'shabitualmethodsofrecordingfacts.Inthetraditionalterminology

Judicious 
methods 
of

are 
nothing

Professor 
Ebbinghaus, 
in 
a 
really 
heroic 
series 
of 
daily 
observations 
of 
more 
than

examined

But 
the 
most 
interesting 
result 
of 
all 
those 
reached 
by 
this 
author 
relates 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
ideas 
are 
recalled 
only 
by 
those 
that 
previously 
came 
immediately 
before 
them, 
or 
whether 
an 
idea 
can 
possibly 
recall 
another 
idea 
with 
which 
it 
was 
never 
in 
immediate 
contact, 
without 
passing 
through 
the 
intermediate 
mental 
links. 
The 
questionisoftheoreticimportancewithregardtothewayinwhichtheprocessof'associationofideas'mustbeconceived;andDr.Ebbinghaus's 
attempt 
is 
as 
successful 
as 
it 
is 
original, 
in 
bringing 
two 
views, 
which 
seem 
at

Mr. 
Wolfe, 
in 
his 
experiments 
on

used

Ofcourse,the 
interval 
of 
time 
between 
the 
two 
tones 
was 
an 
important 
factor. 
The 
proportionate 
number 
of 
correct 
judgments, 
and 
the 
smallness 
of 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
vibration-rates 
of 
the 
two 
tones, 
would 
measure 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
tone-memory. 
It 
appeared 
that 
one 
could 
tell 
more 
readily 
when 
the 
two

This 
law 
is 
subject 
to 
considerable 
variations, 
one 
of 
which 
seems 
to 
be

and 
is 
peculiar;

seems 
to 
be 
a

This 
periodical 
renewal 
of

would 
seem 
to 
be 
an

Forgetting. 


In

Thispeculiarmixtureofforgettingwithourrememberingisbutoneinstance 
of 
our

selective 
activity. 
Selection 
is 
the 
very

on

Andinthiscaseofmemoryitsutilityis 
obvious.Ifwerememberedeverything,weshouldonmostoccasionsbe

never

All 
recollected 
times 
undergo, 
accordingly,whatM.Ribotcallsforeshortening;andthisforeshorteningisduetotheomissionofanenormousnumberofthefactswhichfilled

"As

The

presupposes

We 
thus

the

that

Hypnotic

forget 
all 
that

in 
their

This 
is

them 
(see

ff.). 
In 
certain 
cases 
this 
is 
evidently 
so; 
thethrowingofcertainfunctionalbrain-tractsoutofgearwithothers,soasto 
dissociate 
their 
consciousness 
from 
that 
of 
the 
remaining 
brain, 
throws 
them 
out 
for 
both 
sensorial 
and 
ideational 
service. 
M. 
Janet 
proved 
in 
various 
ways 
that 
what 
his 
patients 
forgot 
when 
anæsthetic 



they 
remembered 
when 
the 
sensibility 
returned. 
For 
instance, 
he 
restored 
their 
tactile 
sense 
temporarily 
by 
means 
of 
electric 
currents, 
passes, 
etc., 
and 
then 
made 
them 
handle 
various 
objects, 
such 
as 
keysandpencils,ormakeparticularmovements,likethesignofthecross.Themoment 
the 
anæsthesia 
returned 
they 
found 
it 
impossible 
to 
recollect 
theobjectsortheacts. 
'Theyhadhadnothingintheirhands, 
theyhad 
done 
nothing,' 
etc. 
The 
next 
day, 
however, 
sensibility 
being 
again 
restored 
by 
similar 
processes, 
they 
remembered 
perfectly 
the 
circumstance, 
and 
told 
what 
they 
had 
handled 
or 
had 
done. 
All 
these 
pathologicalfactsareshowingusthatthesphereofpossiblerecollection

however, 
totheextravagantopinionthatnothing

In

life, 
in 
spite 
of 
occasional 
surprises, 
most 
of 
what 
happens 
actually 
is 
forgotten. 
The 
only 
reasons 
for 
supposing 
that 
if 
the 
conditions 
were 
forthcoming 
everythingwouldreviveareofatranscendentalsort.SirWm.Hamilton 
quotes 
and 
adopts 
them 
from 
the 
German 
writer 
Schmid. 
Knowledge 
beinga'spontaneousself-energy'onthepartofthemind, 


"this

not, 
how 
a

but 
how 
it 
ever 
vanishes."41 


Those 
whom 
such 
an 
argument 
persuades 
may 
be 
left 
happy 
with 
their 
belief. 
Other 
positive 
argument 
there 
is 
none, 
none 
certainly 
ofa 
physiologicalsort.42 


Whenmemorybeginstodecay,propernamesarewhatgofirst,andatalltimespropernamesarehardertorecollectthanthoseofgeneralpropertiesandclassesofthings. 


This 
seems 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
common 
qualities 
and

have 



contractedaninfinitelygreaternumberofassociationsinourmindthanthe

Thereisaninterestingfactconnectedwithremembering,which,so 
far 
as 
I 
know, 
Mr. 
R. 
Verdon 
was 
the 
first 
writer 
expressly 
to 
call 
attention 
to. 
We 
can 
set 
our 
memory 
as 
it 
were 
to 
retain 
things 
for 
a 
certaintime,andthenletthemdepart. 


"Individuals

Thisisperhapsasnearaswecangettoanexplanation. 
Settingthe 
mind 
to 
remember 
a 
thing 
involves 
a 
continual 
minimal 
irradiation 
of 
excitement 
into 
paths 
which 
lead 
thereto, 
involves 
the 
continued 
presence 
of 
the 
thing 
in 
the 
'fringe' 
of 
our 
consciousness. 
Letting 
thethinggoinvolveswithdrawaloftheirradiation,unconsciousnessofthething,and,afteratime,obliterationofthepaths. 


A 
curious 
peculiarity 
of 
our 
memory 
is 
that 
things 
are 
impressed 
better 
by 
active 
than 
by 
passive 
repetition. 
I 
mean 
that 
in 
learning 
by 
heart(for 
example), 
when 
wealmostknowthe

it 
pays 
better 
to 
wait 
and 
recollect 
by 
an 
effort 
from 
within, 
then 
to 
look 
at 
the

Aword,inclosing,aboutthemetaphysicsinvolvedinremembering.
According 
to 
the 
assumptions 
of 
this 
book, 
thoughts 
accompany 
the 
brain'sworkings,andthosethoughtsarecognitiveofrealities.Thewholerelation 
is 
one 
which 
we 
can 
only 
write 
down 
empirically, 
confessing 
that 
no 
glimmer 
of 
explanation 
of 
it 
is 
yet 
in 
sight. 
That 
brains 
should 
giverisetoaknowingconsciousnessatall,thisistheonemysterywhichreturns,nomatterofwhatsorttheconsciousnessandofwhatsorttheknowledge 
may 
be. 
Sensations, 
aware 
of 
mere 
qualities, 
involve 
the 
mysteryasmuchasthoughts,awareofcomplexsystems,involveit. 
To 
the 
platonizing 
tradition 
in 
philosophy, 
however, 
this 
is 
not 
so. 
Sensationalconsciousnessissomethingquasi-material,hardlycognitive,
whichoneneednotmuchwonderat.Relatingconsciousnessisquitethe 
reverse, 
and 
the 
mystery 
of 
it 
is 
unspeakable. 
Professor 
Ladd, 
for 
example,inhisusuallyexcellentbook,50afterwellshowingthematterof-
factdependenceofretentionandreproductiononbrain-paths,says: 


"In

Moreover,

Thus

It

then, 
be

This 
passage 
seems 
to 
me 
characteristic 
of 
the 
reigning 
half-way 
modes 
of 
thought. 
It 
puts 
the 
difficulties 
in 
the 
wrong 
places. 
At 
one 
moment 
it 
seems 
to 
admit 
with 
the 
cruder 
sensationalists 
that 
the 
materialofourthoughtsisindependentsensationsreproduced,andthatthe'puttingtogether'ofthesesensationswouldbeknowledge,ifitcouldonlybebroughtabout,theonlymysterybeingastothewhat'actus'can

incompatiblewiththeirbeingmereimagesrevived.Theresultisvarious 
confused 
and 
scattered 
mysteries 
and 
unsatisfied 
intellectual 
desires. 
But 
why 
not 
'pool' 
our 
mysteries 
into 
one 
great 
mystery, 
the 
mysterythatbrain-processesoccasionknowledgeatall?Itissurelynodifferentmystery 
to 
feel 
myself 
by 
means 
of 
one 
brain-process 
writing 
at 
this 
table 
now, 
and 
by 
means 
of 
a 
different 
brain-process 
a 
year 
hence 
to 
remember 
myself 
writing. 
All 
that 
psychology 
can 
do 
is 
to 
seek 
to 
determine 
what 
the 
several 
brain-processes 
are; 
and 
this, 
in 
a 
wretchedlyimperfectway,iswhatsuchwritingsasthepresentchapterhave 
begun 
to 
do. 
But 
of 
'images 
reproduced,' 
and 
'claiming 
to 
represent,' 
and 
'put 
together 
by 
a 
unifying 
actus,' 
I 
have 
been 
silent, 
because 
such 
expressions 
either 
signify 
nothing, 
or 
they 
are 
onlyroundaboutwaysofsimplysayingthatthepastisknownwhencertainbrain-conditionsarefulfilled,anditseemstomethatthestraightestandshortest

the

which 
brings 
about 
the

Where 
an

is 
complex, 
each 
element 
of 
the 
total 
object 
has 
had 
the 
other

its

world; 
both 
(under 
normal 
conditions) 
need 
the 
stimulation 
of 
incoming 
nerves 
ere 
they 
can 
occur; 
Perception 
always 
involves 
Sensation 
as 
a 
portion 
of 
itself; 
and 
Sensation 
in 
turn 
never 
takes 
place 
in 
adult 
life 
without 
Perception 
also 
being 
there. 
They

3TheCognitive 
FunctionofSensation 


A 
pure 
sensationisan 
abstraction;andwhenweadultstalk 
ofour 
'sensations' 
we 
mean 
one 
of 
two 
things: 
either 
certain 
objects, 
namely 
simple 
qualities 
or 
attributes 
like 
hard, 
hot, 
pain; 
or 
else 
those 
of 
our 
thoughts 
in 
which 
acquaintance 
with 
these 
objects 
is 
least 
combined 
withknowledgeabouttherelationsofthemtootherthings. 
Aswecan 
only 
think 
or 
talk 
about 
the 
relations 
of 
objects 
with 
which 
we 
have 
acquaintance 
already, 
we 
are 
forced 
to 
postulate 
a 
function 
in 
our 
thoughtwherebywefirstbecomeawareofthebareimmediatenaturesby 
which 
our 
several 
objects 
are 
distinguished. 
This 
function 
is 
sensation.Andjustaslogiciansalwayspointoutthedistinctionbetweensubstantive

But 
all 
our 
later 
optical 
knowledge 
is 
about 
what 
this 
experience 
gives. 
And 
though 
we 
were 
struck

from 
that

moment,ourscholarshipinthesubjectwouldlacknoessentialfeaturesolongasourmemoryremained.Intraining-institutionsfortheblindtheyteachthepupilsasmuchaboutlightasinordinaryschools. 
Reflection,

But 
the 
best

nothing

This 
pocket, 
when

is 
the

The 
facts 
which

to

are 
those 
which 
are

of

physiologicallaw. 


TheLawofContrast.

Here 
both 
kinds

be

by

we 
may

discover 
the 
general 
facts 
involved 
in

This 
is 
successive 
contrast. 
It 
finds 
its 
explanation 
in 
the 
fatigue 
of 
the 
organ 
of 
sight, 
causing 
it 
torespondtoanyparticularstimuluslessandlessreadilythelongersuchstimulus

neighboring

thus 
substituting 
'simultaneous

for 
simultaneouscontrast. 


Not 
only 
must 
werecognize 
and 
eliminate 
theeffects 
of 
successive 
contrast, 
of 
temporal 
changes 
due 
to 
fixation, 
and 
of 
simultaneous 
induction,inanalysingthephenomenaofsimultaneouscontrast,butwemust 
also 
take 
into 
account 
various 
other 
influences 
which 
modify 
its 
effects. 
Under 
favorable 
circumstances 
the 
contrast-effects 
are 
verystriking,anddidtheyalwaysoccurasstronglytheycouldnotfailattracttheattention.Buttheyarenotalwaysclearlyapparent,owingtovariousdisturbingcauseswhichformnoexceptiontothelawsofcontrast, 
but 
whichhaveamodifyingeffectonitsphenomena.When,forinstance,the 
ground 
observed 
has 
many 
distinguishable 
features 
--a 
course 
grain, 
rough 
surface, 
intricate 
pattern, 
etc. 
--the 
contrast 
effect 
appears 
weaker. 
This 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
the 
acts 
of 
contrast 
are 
absent, 
but 
merelythattheresultingsensationsareoverpoweredbythemanyotherstronger 
sensations 
which 
entirely 
occupy 
the 
attention. 
On 
such 
a 
ground 
a 
faint 
negative 
after-image 
--undoubtedly 
due 
to 
retinal 
modifications 
--may 
become 
invisible; 
and 
even 
weak 
objective 
differencesincolormaybecomeimperceptible.Forexample,afaintspot 
or 
grease-stain 
on 
woollen 
cloth,

a 
distance, 
when 
the 
fibres 
are 
not 
distinguishable, 
disappears 
when 
closer 
examination

Another 
frequent 
cause 
of 
the 
apparent 
absence 
of 
contrast 
is 
the 
presence 
of 
narrow 
dark 
intermediate 
fields, 
such 
as 
are 
formed 
byborderingafieldwithblacklines,orbytheshadedcontoursofobjects.
When 
such 
fields 
interfere 
with 
the 
contrast, 
it 
is 
because 
black 
and 
white 
can 
absorb 
much 
color 
without 
themselves 
becoming 
clearlycolored;andbecausesuchlinesseparateotherfieldstoofarforthemtodistinctlyinfluenceoneanother.Evenweakobjectivedifferencesincolormaybemadeimperceptiblebysuchmeans. 



A 
third 
case 
where 
contrast 
does 
not 
clearly 
appear 
is 
where 
the 
colorofthecontrastingfieldsistooweakortoointense,orwherethereis 
much 
difference 
in 
brightness 
between 
the 
two 
fields. 
In 
the 
latter 
case, 
as 
can 
easily 
be 
shown, 
it 
is 
the 
contrast 
of 
brightness 
which 
interferes 
with 
the 
color 
contrast 
and 
makes 
it 
imperceptible.

this 
reasoncontrastshowsbestbetweenfieldsofaboutequalbrightness.Buttheintensityofthecolormustnotbetoogreat,forthenitsverydarknessnecessitatesadarkcontrastingfieldwhichistooabsorbentofinducedcolortoallowthecontrasttoappearstrongly.Thecaseissimilarifthe

To

therefore,

To 
eliminate 
these 
disturbances 
and 
to 
produce 
the 
condition 
most 
favorable 
for 
the 
appearance 
of 
good 
contrast-effects, 
various 
experiments 
have 
been 
devised,

Helmholtzmaintainsthat 
the

the

also 
remain 
unchanged,

are 
differently 
interpreted; 
Hering, 
that 
the

and 
the

are 
themselves 
changed, 
and 
that 
the 
'interpretation' 
is 
the 
direct 
conscious 
correlate 
of 
the 
altered 
retinal 
conditions. 
According 
to 
the

the

abovewherethecontrast-colorisnolongerapparent--onagroundwithmanydistinguishablefeatures,onafieldwhosebordersaretracedwithblacklines,etc.,--thepsychologicaltheory,aswehaveseen,attributes

the

under

we 
judge 
the

The 
two

but 
rather

The 
same 
may 
be 
proved 
in 
the 
case 
of 
holding 
above 
the 
tissue 
paper 
a 
second 
gray 
scrap 
and 
comparing 
it 
with 
that 
underneath. 
To 
avoid 
the 
disturbances 
caused 
by 
using 
papers 
of 
different 
brightness, 
the 
second 
scrap 
should 
be 
made 
exactly

the 
first 
by 
covering 
thesamegraywiththesametissuepaper,andcarefullycuttingapieceabout10 
mm. 
square 
out 
of 
both 
together. 
To 
thoroughly 
guard 
against 
successive 
contrast, 
which 
so 
easily 
complicates 
the 
phenomena, 
we 
must 
carefully 
prevent 
all 
previous 
excitation 
of 
the 
retina 
by 
colored 
light.Thismaybedonebyarrangingthus:Placethesheetoftissuepaperonaglasspane,whichrestsonfoursupports;underthepaperputthefirstgrayscrap.Bymeansofawire,fastenthesecondgrayscrap2or3

When 
the 
accommodation 
is 
exact, 
there 
is 
no 
essential 
change, 
although 
then 
on 
the 
upper 
scrap 
the 
bright

on 
the 
side 
toward 
the 
light, 
and 
the 
dark 
edge 
on 
the 
shadow 
side, 
disturb 
somewhat. 
By 
continued 
fixation 
the 
contrast 
becomes 
weaker 
and 
finally 
yields 
to 
simultaneous 
induction, 
causing 
the 
scraps 
to 
become 
indistinguishable 
from 
the 
ground. 
Remove 
the 
green 
field 
and 
both 
scraps 
become 
green, 
by 
successive 
induction. 
If 
the 
eye 
moves

these

This 
explanation 
is 
easily 
proved 
false 
by 
painting 
the 
disk 
with 
narrow 
green

gray 
concentric

Hering 
points 
out 
the 
inaccuracy 
of 
all 
the 
claims. 
Under 
favorable 
conditions 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
make 
the 
contrast 
dissappear 
by 
means 
of 
balck 
enclosing

although 
they 
naturally 
form 
a 
disturbing 
element; 
increase 
in 
the 
saturation 
of 
the 
field, 
if 
disturbance 
through 
increasing 
brightness-contrast 
is 
to

If 
now 
we 
take 
a

and 
through 
it 
look 
at 
the 
colored 
shadow, 
none 
of

and 
then 
have 
the 
colored 
light 
removed, 
the 
shadow 
still 
appears 
colored, 
although 
'thecircumstanceswhichcausedithavedisappeared.' 
Thisis 
regarded 
by 
the 
psychologists 
as 
conclusive 
evidence 
that 
the 
color 
is 
duetodeceptionofjudgment.Itcan,however,easilybeshownthatthe 
persistence 
of 
the 
color 
seen 
through 
the 
tube 
is 
due 
to 
fatigue 
of 
the 
retina 
through 
the 
prevailing 
light, 
and 
that 
when 
the 
colored 
light 
is 
removed 
the 
color 
slowly 
disappears 
as 
the 
equilibrium 
of 
the 
retina 
becomes 
gradually 
restored. 
When 
successive 
contrast 
is 
carefully 
guarded 
against, 
the 
simultaneous 
contrast, 
whether 
seen 
directly 
or 
through 
the 
tube, 
never 
lasts 
for 
an 
instant 
on 
removal 
of 
the

so 
it

as 
they 
are

The

Weoftenheartheopinionexpressedthatalloursensationsatfirst

It 
may 
rather 
be 
said 
to 
be 
a 
mental 
achievement 
[cf. 
Cudworth, 
above, 
as 
to 
knowledge

for 
it 
is 
an 
act 
which 
in 
its 
perfection 
results 
from 
a 
long 
and 
intricate 
process 
of

.

. 
Two 
noteworthy 
stages, 
or 
'epoch-making' 
achievements 
in 
the 
process 
of 
elaborating 
the 
presentations 
of 
sense, 
require 
a 
special 
consideration. 
These 
are 
'localization', 
or 
the 
transferenceofthecompositesensationsfrommerestatesofthemindto 
processes 
or 
conditions 
recognized 
as 
taking 
place 
at

of

and 
'eccentric

(sometimes 
called 
'eccentric

or 
the

On 
the 
principles 
of 
evolution 
such 
a 
sensation 
could 
never 
be 
developed. 
Therefore 
every 
sensation 
originally 
refers 
to 
somethingexternalandindependentofthesentientcreature.Rhizopods

Theselowanimalscanthereforealreadyfeelanouterworld

In 
truth 
the 
conviction 
that 
something 
exists 
outside 
of 
ourselves 
does 
not 
come 
from 
thought. 
It 
comes 
from 
sensation; 
it 
rests 
on 
the 
same 
ground 
as 
our 
conviction 
of 
our 
own 
existence....Ifweconsiderthebehaviorofnew-bornanimals,weneverfindthembetrayingthattheyarefirstofallconsciousoftheirsensationsaspurelysubjectiveexcitements.Wefarmorereadilyinclinetoexplain

. 
. 
. 
Instead 
of 
starting 
from 
an 
original 
pure 
subjectivity 
of 
sensation, 
and 
seeking 
how 
this 
could 
possibly 
have 
acquired 
an 
objective 
signification, 
we 
must, 
on

contrary,beginbythepossessionofobjectivitybythesensationandthenshowhowforreflectiveconsciousnessthelatterbecomesinterpretedas 
an

of

how 
in 
short 
the 
original 
immediate 
objectivity 
becomeschangedintoaremoteone."43 


Another 
confusion, 
much 
more 
common 
than 
the 
denial 
of 
all 
objective 
character 
to 
sensations, 
is 
the 
assumption 
that 
they 
are 
all 
originally 
located 
inside 
the

are

But 
the 
supposition 
that 
a

primitively 
feels 
either 
itself 
or 
its 
object 
to 
be 
in 
the

Butthelater 
developments 
of 
this 
perception 
are 
so 
complicated 
that 
these 
simple 
principles 
get 
easily 
overlooked. 
One 
of 
the

from 
thefactthatthingsmove,andthattheoriginalobjectwhichwefeelthemtobesplitsintotwoparts,

was 
originally 
defined. 
Now 
this 
revision 
of 
our 
original 
localizations 
is 
a 
complex 
affair; 
and 
contains 
some 
facts 
which 
may 
very 
naturally 
come 
to 
be 
described 
as 
translocations 
whereby

Inthe 
muchquotedcaseofthe'younggentlemanwhowasbornblind,'andwho 
was 
'couched' 
for 
the 
cataract 
by 
Mr. 
Chesselden, 
it 
is 
reported 
of 
the 
patientthat"whenhefirstsaw,hewassofarfrommakinganyjudgmentabout

that 
he 
thought 
all

(asheexpressedit)aswhat'hefeltdidhisskin."Andotherpatientsborn 
blind, 
but 
relieved 
by 
surgical 
op-eration, 
have 
been 
described 
as 
bringingtheirhandclosetotheireyestofeelfortheobjectswhichthey 



at 
first 
saw, 
and 
only 
gradually 
stretching 
out 
their 
hand 
when 
they 
foundthatno 
contact 
occurred. 
Many 
have 
concluded 
from 
thesefacts 
thatourearliestvisualobjectsmustseeminimmediatecontactwithour 
eyes. 


But 
tactile 
objects 
also 
may 
be 
affected 
with 
a 
like 
ambiguity 
of 
situation. 


If 
one 
of 
the 
hairs 
of 
our 
head 
be 
pulled, 
we 
are 
pretty 
accuratelysensibleofthedirectionofthepullingbythemovementsimpartedtothehead. 
45 
But 
the 
feeling 
of 
the 
pull 
is 
localized, 
not 
in 
that 
part 
of 
the 
hair's 
length 
which 
the 
fingers 
hold, 
but 
in 
the 
scalp 
itself. 
This 
seems 
connected 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
hair 
hardly 
serves 
at 
all 
as 
a 
tactile 
organ. 
In 
creatures 
with 
vibrisse, 
however, 
and 
in 
those 
quadrupeds 
whose 
whiskers 
are 
tactile 
organs, 
it 
can 
hardly 
be 
doubted 
that 
the 
feeling 
is 
projected 
out 
of 
the 
root 
into 
the 
shaft 
of 
the 
hair 
itself. 
We 
ourselves 
have 
an 
approach 
to 
this 
when 
the 
beard 
as 
a 
whole, 
or 
the 
hair 
as 
a 
whole, 
is 
touched. 
We 
perceive 
the

Theothercasesoftranslocationofoursensationsareequallyeasilyinterpreted

But 
by

from

we

Wecanidentifyitwithadifferentlylocatedtactileandvisualimageof'thejoint'itself. 


Just 
so 
when 
we

of

against 
the 
ground. 
The

touches

know 
under 
that

We 
think 
of 
'the 
ground' 
as 
being 
there 
and 
givingusthesensationofthiskindofmovement.Thesensation,wesay, 
comes 
from 
the 
ground. 
The 
ground's 
place 
seems 
to 
be 
its 
place; 
although 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
and 
for 
very 
similar 
practical 
reasons, 
we 
think 
of 
another 
optical

tactile 
object, 
'the

and 
considerthatitsplacealsomustbetheplaceofoursensation.Inother

identify 
its

with 
their 
places. 
But 
in 
all 
this 
thereisno'projecting'(suchastheextradition-philosopherstalkof)ofA

original

no 
primitive 
location 
which 
it

away 
from 
these 
other 
sensations, 
has 
to 
be 
contradicted; 
no 
natural 
'

from 
which 
it 
is

exists.

I 
conclude, 
then, 
that 
there 
is 
no

in 
the 
'eccentric

-Physiologically,

Those 
thoughts 
which 
lie 
farthest 
in 
that 
direction 
we 
call 
sensations, 
for 
practical 
convenience, 
just 
as 
we 
call 
conceptions 
those 
which 
lie 
nearer 
the 
opposite

But 
we 
no 
more 
have 
conceptions 
pure 
than 
we 
have 
pure 
sensations. 
Our 
most 
rarefied 
intellectual 
states 
involve 
some 
bodily 
sensibility, 
just 
as 
our 
dullest 
feelings 
have 
some 
intellectual 
scope. 
Common-sense 
and 
common 
psychology 
express 
this 
by 
saying 
that

Such 
passages 
as 
the

abound 
in 
anti-sensationalist 
literature: 


"Sense

of 
dull, 
confused,

stupid

Forthesoulsufferingunderthatwhichitperceivesbywayofpassioncannotmasterorconquerit,thatistosay,knoworunderstandit.Forso 
Anaxigoras

The

mixed 
up 
with

Hume 
was 
the 
hero 
of 
the 
atomistic 
theory. 
Not

accordingtohim,completelyadequatecopies,andwereallsoseparatefrom

Hume

It 
is 
a 
rather 
remarkable 
thing, 
too, 
that 
the

of

asarule,

havebeen,onthewhole,moreaccuratelyreportedbythespiritualisticwriters.NoneofHume'spupils,sofarasIknow,untilTaineandHuxley,
evertookthepainstocontradicttheopinionoftheirmaster.Prof.Huxleyin 
his 
brilliant 
little 
work 
on 
Hume 
set 
the 
matter 
straight 
in 
the 
followingwords: 


"When 
complex 
impressions 
or 
complex 
ideas 
are 
reproduced 
as 
memories,itisprobablethatthecopiesnevergiveallthedetailsoftheoriginalswithperfectaccuracy,anditiscertainthattheyrarelydoso.No 
one 
possesses 
a 
memory 
so 
good, 
that

only

ratherthanportraits,oftheoriginals--thesalientfeaturesareobvious,
whilethesubordinatecharactersareobscureorunrepresented. 


"Now, 
when 
several 
complex 
impressions 
which 
are 
more 
or 
less 
different 
from 
one 
another 
--let 
us 
say 
that 
out 
of 
ten 
impressions 
in 
each,sixarethesameinall,andfouraredifferentfromalltherest--are 
successively 
presented 
to 
the 
mind, 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
see 
what 
must 
be 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
result. 
The 
repetition 
of 
the 
six 
similar 
impressions 
will 
strengthen 
the 
six 
corresponding 
elements 
of 
the 
complex 
idea, 
which 
will 
therefore 
acquire 
greater 
vividness; 
while 
the 
four 
differingimpressionsofeachwillnotonlyacquirenogreaterstrengththantheyhadatfirst,but,inaccordancewiththelawofassociation,theywillalltendtoappearatonce,andwillthusneutralizeoneanother.

are 
incomplete 
in 
another 
way; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
they 
are 
generic, 
not 
specific. 
And 
hence 
it 
follows 
that 
our 
ideas 
of 
the 
impressions 
in

are 
not, 
in 
the 
strict

The 
first 
breaker 
of 
ground 
in 
this 
direction 
was 
Fechner, 
in 
1860. 
Fecherwasgiftedwithunusualtalentforsubjectiveobservation,andinchapter 
xiv 
of 
his 
'Psychophysik' 
he 
gave 
the 
results 
of 
a 
most 
careful 
comparison 
of 
his 
own 
optical 
after-images, 
with 
his 
optical 
memory-
pictures, 
together 
with 
accounts 
by 
several 
other 
individuals 
of 
their 
optical 
memory-pictures. 
7 
The 
results 
was 
to 
show 
a 
great 
personal 
diversity. 
"It 
would 
be 
interesting," 
he 
writes, 
to 
work 
up 
the 
subject 
statistically; 
and 
I 
regret 
that 
other 
occupations 
have 
kept 
me 
from 
fulfillingmyearlierintentiontoproceedinthisway."Fechner'sintention 
was 
independently 
executed 
by 
Mr. 
Galton, 
the 
publication 
of 
whose 
results 
in 
1880 
may 
be 
said 
to 
have 
made 
an 
era 
in 
descriptive 
Psychology.

Colonel 
Moncrieff 
often 
observed 
in 
North 
America 
young 
Indians 
who, 
visiting 
occasionally 
his 
quarters, 
interested 
themselves 
greatly 
in 
the 
engravings 
which 
were 
shown 
them. 
One 
of 
them 
followed 
with 
care 
with 
the 
point 
of 
his 
knife 
the 
outline 
of 
a 
drawing 
in 
the 
Illustrated 
London 
News, 
saying 
that 
this

Most 
persons, 
on 
being 
asked 
in 
what 
sort 
of 
terms 
they 
imagine 
words, 
will 
say 
'in

It 
is 
not 
until 
their 
attention 
is 
expressly 
drawn 
to 
the 
point 
that 
they 
find 
it 
difficult 
to 
say 
whether 
auditory 
images 
or 
motor 
images 
connected 
with 
the 
organs 
of 
articulation 
predominate. 
A 
good 
way 
of 
bringing 
the 
difficulty 
to 
consciousnessisthatproposedbyStricker:Partlyopenyourmouthandthen

they 
triedtopronounceitwiththelipsparted. 
Manycanneverimaginethe

others 
succeed 
after 
a 
few 
preliminary

most

he 
makes

1) 
In

the 
starting-point 
of

must 
be 
in 
the

2)Thereisbetweenimaginedobjectsandfeltobjectsadifferenceofconscious

which

almost 
absolute.

Incomparingapresentsensationfeltwithapastoneimagined,itwillberememberedthat 
we 
often 
judge 
the

been 
the 
stronger 
(see 
above, 
p. 
500, 
note). 
Thisisinexplicableiftheimaginationbesimplyaweakerexcitementofthesensationalprocess. 


To 
these 
reasons 
the 
following 
objections 
may 
be 
made: 
To 
l): 
The 
current 
demonstrably 
does 
flow 
backward 
down 
the 
optic 
nerve 
in 
Meyer'sandFéré'snegativeafterimage.Thereforeitcanflowbackward; 
thereforeit 
may 
flow 
backward 
in 
some, 
however 
slight, 
degree, 
in 
all 
imagination.33 


To 
2): 
The 
difference 
alleged 
is 
not 
absolute, 
and 
sensation 
and 
imaginationarehardtodiscriminatewherethesensationissoweakastobejustperceptible.Atnighthearingaveryfaintstrikingofthehourbyafar-offclock,ourimaginationreproducesbothrhythmandsound,andit

After 
the 
pianissimo 
has 
been 
reached 
they 
continue 
to 
bow 
as 
if 
still 
playing, 
but 
are 
careful 
not 
to 



touch 
the 
strings. 
The 
listener 
hears 
in 
imagination 
a 
degree 
of 
sound 
fainter 
still 
than 
the 
preceding 
pianissimo. 
This 
phenomenon 
is 
not 
confinedtohearing: 


"If 
we 
slowly 
approach 
our 
finger 
to 
a 
surface 
of 
water, 
we 
often 
deceive 
ourselves 
about 
the 
moment 
in 
which 
the 
wetting 
occurs. 
The 
apprehensive

himself

Sensation-processes 
occupy 
a 
different 
locality 
from 
imaginationprocesses;
or 


2. 
Occupying 
thesame 
locality, 
they 
have 
an 
intensity 
which 
under 
normalcircumstancescurrentsfromothercorticalregionsareincapableof 
arousing, 
and 
to 
produce 
which 
currents 
from 
the 
periphery 
are 
required. 
Itseemsalmostcertain(afterwhatwassaidinChapterII.pp.49-51) 
that 
the 
imagination-process 
dryers 
from 
the 
sensation-process 
by 
its 
intensity 
rather 
than 
by 
its 
locality.

In

cases 
of 
hemianopsia 
the 
patient's 
images 
depart 
from 
him 
together 
with 
his

They

neighboringcortical 
parts. 
We 
can 
see, 
in 
short, 
why 
the 
sensational 
process 
OUGHT 
TO 
be 
discontinuous 
with 
all 
normal 
ideational 
processes, 
however 
intense. 



For,asDr.Münsterbergjustlyobserves: 


"Weretherenotthispeculiararrangementweshouldnotdistinguishrealityandfantasy,ourconductwouldnotbeaccommodatedtothefactsabout 
us, 
but 
would 
be 
inappropriate 
and 
senseless, 
and 
we 
could 
not 
keep 
ourselves 
alive. 
. 
. 
. 
That 
our 
thoughts 
and 
memories 
should 
be 
copies 
of 
sensations 
with 
their 
intensity 
greatly 
reduced 
is 
thus 
a 
consequence 
deducible 
logically 
from 
the 
natural 
adaptation 
of 
the 
cerebralmechanismtoitsenvironment."36 


Mechanically 
the 
discontinuity 
between 
the 
ideational 
and 
the 
sensational 
kinds 
of 
process 
must 
mean 
that 
when 
the 
greatest 
ideational 
intensity 
has 
been 
reached, 
an 
order 
of 
resistance 
presents 
itself 
which 
only 
a 
new 
order 
of 
force 
can 
break 
through. 
The 
current 
fromtheperipheryistheneworderofforcerequired;andwhathappensafter 
the 
resistance 
is 
overcome 
is 
the 
sensational 
process. 
We 
may 
suppose 
that 
the 
latter 
consists 
in 
some 
new 
and 
more 
violent 
sort 
of 
disintegrationoftheneuralmatter,whichnowexplodesatadeeperlevelthanatothertimes. 


Now 
how 
shall 
we 
conceive 
of 
the 
'resistance' 
which 
prevents 
this 
sort 
of 
disintegration 
from 
taking 
place, 
this 
sort 
of 
intensity 
in 
the 
processfrombeingattained,somuchofthetime?Itmustbeeitheranintrinsic 
resistance, 
some

the 
neural 
molecules 
themselves;oranextrinsicinfluence,duetoothercorticalcells.Whenwecometostudytheprocessofhallucinationweshallseethatbothfactorsmust 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
There 
is 
a 
degree 
of 
inward 
molecular 
cohesion 
in 
our 
brain-cells 
while 
it 
probably 
takes 
a 
sudden

no

I 
think 
it 
must 
be 
admitted 
that 
some 
people 
have 
no 
vivid 
substantive 
images 
in 
any 
department 
of 
their 
sensibility. 
One 
of

that 
there

I 
myself 
certainly 
have 
no 
such 
vivid 
play 
of 
nascent 
movements 
or 
motor 
images 
as 
Professor 
Stricker 
describes. 
When 
I 
seek 
to

all 
I 
catch

a

The

PerceptionandSensationCompared. 


A 
PURE 
sensation 
we 
saw 
above, 
p.

to 
be 
an 
abstraction 
never 
realized 
in

life.

The

the 
thing's

relations. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
draw 
anysharplineofdistinctionbetweenthebarerandthericherconsciousness,
because 
the 
moment 
we 
get 
beyond 
the 
first 
crude

all 
our

is 
a 
matter 
of

and

machinery 
of

In 
the 
directer 
consciousness

Perception 
thus 
differs 
from 
sensation 
by 
the 
consciousness 
of 
fartherfactsassociatedwiththeobjectofthesensation: 


"WhenIliftmyeyesfromthepaperonwhichIamwritingIseethechairsandtablesandwallsofmyroom,eachofitspropershapeandatits

I 
see, 
from 
my

and

Yetphilosophyhasascertainedthatwederivenothingfromtheeyewhatever 
but 
sensations

... 
How, 
then, 
is 
it 
that 
we 
receive 
accurate 
information, 
by 
the 
eye, 
of 
size 
and 
shape 
and 
distance? 
By 
associationmerely.Thecolorsuponabodyaredifferent,accordingtoits

But 
the 
sensations 
of

and 
what 
we 



may 
here, 
for

call 
the

The 
sight, 
as 
it 
is 
called, 
of 
figure, 
or 
distance, 
appearing 
as 
it 
does 
a 
simple 
sensation, 
is 
in 
reality 
a 
complex 
state 
of 
consciousness 
--a 
sequence 
in 
which 
the 
antecedent, 
a 
sensation 
of

and 
the

ThispassagefromJamesMill2givesaclearstatementofthedoctrinewhichBerkeleyinhisTheoryofVisionmadeforthefirsttimeanintegralpart 
of 
Psychology. 
Berkeley 
compared 
our 
visual 
sensations 
to 
the 
wordsofalanguage,whicharebutsignsoroccasionsforourintellectsto 
pass 
to 
what 
the 
speaker 
means. 
As 
the 
sounds 
called 
words 
have 
no 
inward 
affinity 
with 
the 
ideas 
they 
signify, 
so 
neither 
have 
our 
visual 
sensations,accordingtoBerkeley,anyinwardaffinitywiththethingsofwhosepresencetheymakeusaware.Thosethingsaretangible;theirrealproperties, 
such 
as 
shape, 
size, 
mass, 
consistency, 
position, 
reveal 
themselves 
only 
to 
touch. 
But 
the 
visible 
signs 
and 
the 
tangible 
significates 
are 
by 
long 
custom 
so 
"closely 
twisted, 
blended, 
and 
incorporatedtogether,andtheprejudiceissoconfirmedandrivetedinourthoughtsbyalongtractoftime,bytheuseoflanguage,andwantofreflection,"3thatwethinkweseethewholeobject,tangibleandvisiblealike,inonesimpleindivisibleact. 


Sensational 
and 
reproductive 
brain-processes 
combined, 
then, 
are 
what 
give 
us 
the 
content 
of 
our 
perceptions. 
Every 
concrete 
particular 
material 
thing 
is 
a 
conflux 
of 
sensible 
qualities, 
with 
which 
we 
have 
becomeacquaintedatvarioustimes.Someofthesequalities,sincethey 
are 
more 
constant, 
interesting, 
or 
practically 
important, 
we 
regard 
as 
essentialconstituentsofthething.Inageneralway,sucharethetangibleshape, 
size, 
mass, 
etc. 
Other 
properties, 
being 
more 
fluctuating, 
we 
regard 
as 
more 
or 
less 
accidental 
or 
inessential. 
We 
call 
the 
former 
qualitiesthereality,thelatteritsappearances.Thus,Ihearasound,and 
say'ahorse-car';butthesoundisnotthehorse-car,itisoneofthehorsecar'sleastimportantmanifestations.

a

thing 
which 
in 
my 
imagination 
the 
sound 
calls 
up. 
So 
when 
I 
get, 
as 
now, 
a 
brown 
eye-picture 
with 
lines 
not

with

The

of 
the

its 
square 
corners, 
its 
size, 
its 
heaviness, 
are 
features 
of

I

and 
to

would

therefore 
both 
unnecessary 
and 
tedious.

we 
have 
that

This, 
asit

is 
the

In

it 
is 
easy 
to 
compare 
the

of

as

Then, 
usually, 
their 
interpretation 
suddenly 
occurs. 
But 
at 
that 
moment 
one 
may 
often 
surprise 
a 
change 
in 
the 
very 
feel 
of 
the

Our

The 
chief 
cerebral 
conditions 
of 
perception 
are 
the 
paths 
of

If 
a

sensation

strongly 
associated 
with 
the 
attributes 
of 
a 
certain 
thing, 
that 
thing 
is 
almost

to 
be 
perceived 
when

how

how

that

Curiousillusionsofmovementinobjectsoccurwhenevertheeyeballs 
move 
withoutour 
intendingit. 
We 
shall 
learninthe 
followingchapter 
that 
the 
original 
visual 
feeling 
of 
movement 
is 
produced 
by 
any 
image 
passingovertheretina. 
Originally,however,thissensationisdefinitely 
referred 
neither 
to 
the 
object 
nor 
to 
the 
eyes. 
Such 
definite 
reference 
grows 
up 
later, 
and 
obeys 
certain 
simple 
laws. 
We 
believe 
objects 
to 
move:1)wheneverwegettheretinalmovement-feeling,butthinkoureyesarestill;and2)wheneverwethinkthatoureyesmove,butfailtoget 
the 
retinal 
movement-feeling. 
We 
believe 
objects 
to 
be 
still, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
1) 
whenever 
we 
get 
the 
retinal 
movement-feeling, 
but 
think 
our 
eyes 
are 
moving; 
and 
2) 
whenever 
we 
neither 
think 
our 
eyes 
are 
moving,norgettheretinalmovement-feeling.Thustheperceptionofthe 
object'sstateofmotionorrestdependsonthenotionweframeofour 
own 
eye's

Now 
many 
sorts 
of 
stimulation 
make 
our 
eyes 
move 
without 
our 
knowing 
it. 
If 
we 
look 
at 
a

Thentheyjerkbacktothe

so 
on 
indefinitely. 
This 
gives 
them 
an 
oscillating 
demeanor, 
slow 
involuntary 
rotations 
leftward 
alternating 
with 
rapid 
voluntary 
jerks 
rightward. 
Puttheoscillationscontinueforawhileaftertheobjecthas

Itisafeelingofmovementofourownheadand

is 
now 
pretty 
well 
understood 
to 
be

to 
the

Even 
though 
we 
falsely 
think 
our 
head 
to 
be 
moving 
leftwards, 
this 
consequence 
occurs, 
and 
our

Thewhole

as 
these 
illusions 
of 
objective 
movement 
are 
called,
resultssometimesfrombrain-trouble,intoxications,paralysis,etc.Amanwill 
awaken 
with 
a, 
weakness

An 
intended 



orbitalrotationwillthennotproduceitsexpectedresultinthewayofretinalmovement-feeling-whencefalseperceptions,ofwhichoneofthemostinterestingcaseswillfalltobediscussedinlaterchapters.Thereis 
an 
illusion 
of 
movement 
of 
the 
opposite 
sort, 
with 
which 
every 
one 
is 
familiar 
at 
railway 
stations. 
Habitually, 
when 
we 
ourselves 
move 
forward,ourentirefieldofviewglidesbackwardoverourretina.When 
ourmovementisduetothatofthewindowedcarriage, 
car, 
orboatin 
whichwesit,allstationaryobjectsvisiblethroughthewindowgiveusasensation 
of 
gliding 
in 
the 
opposite 
direction. 
Hence, 
whenever 
we 
getthissensation,ofawindowwithallobjectsvisiblethroughitmovingin 
one 
direction, 
we 
react 
upon 
it 
in 
our 
customary 
way, 
and 
perceive 
a 
stationaryfieldofview,overwhichthewindow,andweourselvesinsideof 
it, 
are 
passing 
by 
a 
motion 
of 
our 
own. 
Consequently 
when 
another 
train 
comes 
alongside 
ofours 
in 
astation, 
andfills 
the 
entirewindow,
and,afterstandingstillawhile,beginstoglideaway,wejudgethatitisourtrainwhichismoving,andthattheothertrainisstill.If,however,wecatch 
a 
glimpse 
of 
any 
part 
of 
the 
station 
through 
the 
windows, 
or 
betweenthecars,oftheothertrain,theillusionofourownmovementinstantly 
disappears, 
and 
we 
perceive 
the 
other 
train 
to 
be 
the 
one 
in 
motion.This,again,isbutmakingtheusualandprobableinferencefromoursensation.12 


Another 
illusion 
due 
to 
movement 
is 
explained 
by 
Helmholtz. 
Most 
wayside 
objects, 
houses, 
trees, 
etc., 
look 
small 
when 
seen 
out 
of 
the 
windowsofaswifttrain. 
Thisisbecauseweperceivetheminthefirst 
instance 
unduly 
near. 
And 
we 
perceive 
them 
unduly 
near 
because 
of 
their 
extra-ordinarily 
rapid 
parallactic 
flight 
backwards. 
When 
we 
ourselvesmoreforwardallobjectsglidebackwards,asaforesaid;butthenearertheyare,

Relative 
rapidity 
of

back-wards 
is 
thus 
so 
familiarly 
associated 
with 
nearnessthatwhenwefeelitweperceivenearness.Butwithagivensizeofretinalimagetheneareranobjectis,

Other 
illusions 
are 
due 
to 
the 
feeling 
of 
convergence 
being 
interpreted. 
When 
we 
converge 
our 
eyeballs 
we 
an 
approximation 
of

The 
size 
of 
the 
retinal 
image 
is 
a 
fruitful 
source 
of 
illusions. 
Normally, 
theretinal 
image

of

of

In 
this 
type 
we 
perceive 
a

full 
of

IrememberonenightinBoston,

most 
distinctly 
that

upon 
the

of 
a

on 
which 
(as 
I 
afterwards

'North

was 
painted.

Testimony

proverbially 
fallacious

carries 
away

"During 
the 
winter 
of 
1858, 
while 
in 
Venice, 
I 
had 
the 
somewhat 
peculiar 
illusion 
which 
you 
request 
me 
to 
relate.

Themoonwasshiningbrightly, 
andI 
remember 
standing 
before 
a 
draped 
window, 
thinking 
of 
the 
romantic 
natureofthesurroundings,remnantsofoldstoriesofknightsandladies,
and 
the 
possibility 
that 
even 
in 
that 
room 
itself 
love-scenes 
and 
sanguinary 
tragedies 
might 
have 
taken 
place. 
The

Thehorror 
which 
took 
possessionofmy 
young 
fancy 
was 
beyondanything 
I 
have 
ever 
experienced. 
The 
head 
was 
covered 
by 
a

concluded 
to 
try 
to

with 
the

It 
remained 
perfectly

until 
I 
reached 
at 
it 
sharply 
with

ThePhysiologicalProcessinPerception. 


Enough 
has 
now 
been 
said 
to 
prove 
the 
general 
law 
of 
perception, 
which 
is 
this, 
that

we

through 
our

At

this 
is 
only 
one

why 
should 
we 
entertain 
it

confessedly

by 
which 
on 
previous 
occasions 
the

was 
most 
frequently 
aroused. 
But 
we 
can, 
I 
think, 
without 
danger 
of 
being 
too 
speculative, 
be 
a 
little 
more 
exact 
than 
this, 
and 
conceive 
of 
a 
physiological 
reason 
why 
the 
felt 
quality 
of 
an 
object 
changes 
when, 
instead 
of 
being 
apprehended 
in 
a 
mere 
sensation, 
the 
object 
is: 
perceived 
as 
a

this

We

another 
example 
of 
this 
semi-hallucinatory 
power 
of 
the 
suggested

Amputated 
people, 
as 
we 
have

that

Professor 
H. 
Steinthal 
has 
analyzed 
apperceptive 
processes 
with 
a, 
sort 
of 
detail 
which 
is 
simply 
burdensome. 
33 
His 
introduction 
of 
the 
matter 
may, 
however, 
be 
quoted. 
He 
begins 
with 
an 
anecdote 
from 
a 
comicpaper. 


"In 
the 
compartment 
of 
a

Another 
thereupon 
says 
that 
he 
will 
undertake 
to 
decide 
this 
question, 
if 
they 



each 
and 
all 
will 
answer 
him 
an 
entirely 
disconnected 
question. 
They 
began.Hedrewfiveleavesfromhisnote-book,wroteaquestiononeach,
andgaveonetoeachofhiscompanionswiththerequestthathewritethe 
answer 
below. 
When 
the 
leaves 
were 
returned 
to 
him, 
he 
turned,
afterreadingthem,withouthesitationtotheothers,andsaidtothefirst,
'Youareamanofscience';tothesecond,'Youareasoldier';tothethird, 
'You

'You

fifth, 
'Youareafarmer.'Alladmittedthathewasright,whereuponhegotoutandleftthefivebehind.Eachwishedtoknowwhatquestiontheothershadreceived;andbehold,hehadgiventhesamequestiontoeach.Itran 
thus: 


"Whatbeingdestroyswhatithasitselfbroughtforth? 


"To 
this 
the 
naturalist 
had 
answered, 
'natural 
force'; 
the 
soldier, 
'war';thephilologist, 
'Kronos';thepublicist, 
'revolution';thefarmer, 
'a 
boar'. 
This 
anecdote, 
methinks, 
if 
not 
true, 
is 
at 
least 
splendidly 
well 
invented. 
Its 
narrator 
makes 
the

In

of

it 
has 
happened 
often 
enough 
that 
some 
discovery, 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
it 
was 
apperceived, 
i.e. 
brought 
into 
connection 
with 
the

IsPerceptionUnconsciousInference? 


A 
widely-spread 
opinion 
(which 
has 
been 
held 
by 
such 
men 
as 
Schopenhauer, 
Spencer, 
Hartmann, 
Wundt, 
Helmholtz, 
and 
lately 
interestingly 
pleaded 
for 
by 
M. 
Binet 
37) 
will 
have 
it 
that 
perception 
should 
be 
called 
a 
sort 
of 
reasoning 
operation, 
more 
or 
less 
unconsciouslyandautomaticallyperformed.Thequestionseemsatfirst 
a 
verbal 
one, 
depending 
on 
how 
broadly 
the 
term 
reasoning 
is 
to 
be 
taken. 
If, 
every 
time 
a 
present 
sign 
suggests 
an 
absent 
reality 
to 
our 
mind,wemakeaninference;andifeverytimewemakeaninferencewereason;thenperceptionisindubitablyreasoning.Onlyoneseesnoroominitforanyunconsciouspart.Bothassociates,thepresentsignandthe 
contiguous 
things 
which 
it 
suggests, 
are 
above-board, 
and 
no 
intermediary 
ideas 
are 
required. 
Most 
of 
those 
who 
have 
upheld 
the 
thesis 
in 
question 
have, 
however, 
made 
a 
more 
complex 
supposition.
Whattheyhavemeantisthatperceptionisamediateinference,andthatthemiddletermisunconscious.WhenthesensationwhichIhavecalled 
'this'(p.83,supra)isfelt,theythinkthatsomeprocesslikethefollowingrunsthroughthemind:

butMisA; 


therefore'this'isA38 


Nowthereseemnogoodgroundsforsupposingthisadditionalwheelwork 
in 
the 
mind. 
The 
classification 
of 
'this' 
as 
M 
is 
itself 
an 
act 
of 
perception, 
and 
should, 
if 
all 
perception 
were 
inference, 
require 
a 
still 
earliersyllogismforitsperformance,andsobackwardsininfinitum.The 
only 
extrication 
from 
this 
coil 
would 
be 
to 
represent 
the 
process 
in 
alteredguise,thus: 


'This'islikethose; 


ThoseareA; 


Therefore'this'isA. 



The 
major 
premise 
here 
involves 
no 
association 
by 
contiguity, 
no 
namingofthoseasM,butonlyasuggestionofunnamedsimilarimages,arecallofanalogouspastsensationswithwhichthecharactersthatmakeupAwerehabituallyconjoined.Buthereagain,whatgroundsoffactare

Since 
the 
brain-process 
of 
'this,' 
the 
sign 
of 
A, 
has 
repeatedly 
beenarousedincompanywiththeprocessofthefullobjectA,directpathsofirradiationfromtheonetotheothermustbealreadyestablished. 
And

assuming 
them 
to 
be 
traversed 
now, 
especially 
since 
appearances 
point 
the 
other 
way. 
In 
explicit 
reasoning, 
such 
paths 
are 
doubtless 
traversed 
in 
perception 
they 
are 
in 
all 
probability 
closed. 
So 
far, 
then,
fromperceptionbeingaspeciesofreasoningproperlysocalled,bothitand 
reasoning 
are 
co-ordinate 
varieties 
of 
that 
deeper 
sort 
of

thus

a

The

as

Pseudo-hallucinations

"In

But

of

of 
his 
persecutors 
('coming 
from 
a 
hollow 
space 
in 
the 
midst 
of

From 
ordinary 
images 
of 
memory 
and 
fancy, 
pseudo-hallucinations 
differ 
in

The

a

then

pseudo-hallucinations, 
finally 
as 
full-hedged

If

The 
usual 
explanation 
of 
hypnagogic 
hallucinations 
that 
they 
are 
ideas 
deprived 
of 
their 
ordinary 
reductives. 
In

the

it 
is 
said, 
then 
having

At 
ordinary 
times 
the 
objects 
of 
our 
imagination 
are 
reduced 
to 
the 
status 
subjective 
facts 
by 
the 
ever-present 
contrast 
of 
our 
sensations 
withthem. 
Eliminate 
the

however, 
thisview

and 
the'images'areforthwith'projected'intotheouterworldandappearasrealities,Thusistheillusionofdreamsalsoexplained.This,indeed,after

gives 
an 
account 
of

And 
yet 
it

Dr. 
Hughlings 
Jackson's 
explanation 
of 
the 
epileptic 
seizure 
is 
acknowledged 
to 
be 
masterly. 
It 
involves 
principles 
exactly 
like 
those 



whichIambringingforwardhere.The'lossofconsciousness'inepilepsyisduetothemosthighlyorganizedbrain-processesbeingexhaustedandthrown 
out 
of 
gear. 
The 
less 
organized 
(more 
instinctive) 
processes,
ordinarilyinhibitedbytheothers,arethenexalted,sothatwegetasa 
mere 
consequence 
of 
relief 
from 
the 
inhibition, 
the 
meaningless 
or 
maniacalactionwhichsooftenfollowstheattack.49 


Similarlythesubsultustendinorumorjerkingofthemuscleswhichsooftenstartlesuswhenweareonthepointoffallingasleep, 
maybe 
interpreted 
as 
due 
to 
the 
rise 
(in 
certain 
lower 
motor 
centres) 
of 
the 
ordinary 
'tonic' 
tension 
to 
the 
explosion-point, 
when 
the 
inhibition 
commonlyexertedbythehighercentresfallstoosuddenlyaway. 


One 
possible 
condition 
of 
hallucination 
then 
stands 
revealed, 
whatever 
other 
conditions 
there 
may 
be. 
When 
the 
normal 
paths 
of 
associationbetweenacentreandothercentresarethrownoutofgear, 
any 
activity 
which

in

and 
the

50 
Thus 
it 
will 
happen 
that 
causes 
of 
an 
amount 
of 
activity 
in 
brain-cells 
which 
would 
ordinarily

and 
nothing

Thepartplayedbytheperipheralsense-organinhallucinationisjust 
as 
obscure 
as 
we 
found 
it 
in 
the 
case 
of 
imagination. 
The 
things 
seen 
often 
seem 
opaque 
and 
hide 
the 
background 
upon 
which 
they 
are 
projected. 
It 
does 
not 
follow 
from 
this, 
however, 
that 
the 
retina 
is 
actuallyinvolvedinthevision.Acontraryprocessgoingoninthevisualcentreswouldpreventtheretinalimpressionmadebytheouterrealitiesfrom

and 
this 
would 
in 
mental 
terms 
be 
equivalent 
to 
the 
hiding 
of 
them 
by 
the 
imaginary 
figure. 
The 
negative 
after-images 
of 
mental 
pictures 
reported 
by 
Meyer 
and 
Féré, 
and 
the 
negative 
afterimages 
of 
hypnotic 
hallucinations 
reported 
by 
Binet 
and 
others 
so 
far 
constitute 
theonly 
evidence 
thereis 
forthe 
retina 
being 
involved. 
But

'PERCEPTION-TIME,' 


The 
time 
which 
the 
perceptive 
process 
occupies 
has 
been 
inquired 
into 
by 
various 
experimenters. 
Some 
call 
it 
perception-time, 
some 
choice-time, 
some 
discrimination-time. 
The 
results 
have 
been 
alreadygiveninChapterXIII(vol.,p.623ff.),towhichthereaderisconsequentlyreferred.

The 
word 
Perception. 
however, 
has 
been 
variously 
used. 
For 
historical 
notices, 
see 
Hamilton's 
Lectures 
on 
Metaphysics, 
ii. 
96. 
For 
Hamilton 
perception 
is 
the 
consciousness 
of 
external 
objects 
(ib. 
28). 
Spencer 
defines 
it 
oddly 
enough 
as 
"a 
discerning 
of 
the 
relation 
or 
relationsbetweenstatesofconsciousnesspartlypresentativeandpartlyrepresentative; 
which 
states 
of 
consciousness 
must 
be 
themselves 
known 
to 
the 
extent 
involved 
in 
the 
knowledge 
of 
their 
relations"

The

TheFeelingofCrudeExtensity. 


IN

of

We 
call 
the

the

It

In

manner 
extensity, 
being 
an

peculiar 
kind 
of

indescribable 
except

Persons 
born

are 
reported 
surprised 
at 
the 
largeness

which

In 
the 
sphere 
of 
vision 
we 
have 
facts 
of 
the 
same 
order. 
'Glowing' 
bodies, 
as 
Hering 
says, 
give 
us 
a 
perception 
"which 
seems 
roomy 
(raumhaft)incomparisonwiththatofstrictlysurfacecolor. 
Aglowing 
iron 
looks 
luminous

and

and 
so

AsHering 
urges: 


" 
We 
must 
distinguish

we

There 
are 
certain 
quasi-motor 
sensations 
in 
the 
head 
when 
we 



change 
the 
direction 
of

Fechner

I

But 
with

we 
pass 
to 
the

relations 
something 
tote 
coelo 
different 
from 
all 
facts 
of 
feeling 
or 
imagination 
whatsoever. 
A 
relation, 
for 
the 
Platonizing 
school 
in 
psychology, 
is 
an 
energy 
of 
pure 
thought, 
and, 
as 
such, 
is 
quiteincommensurablewiththedataofsensibilitybetweenwhichitmaybeperceived

We 
may 
consequently 
imagine 
a 
disciple 
of 
this 
school 
to 
say 
to 
us 
at 
this 
point: 
"Suppose 
you

And 
not

it

and

confess 
that 
Thought 
alone 
can 
unlock 
the 
riddle 
of 
space, 
and 
that 
Thought 
is 
an 
adorable 
but 
unfathomable 
mystery. 
Such 
a 
method 
of 
dealingwiththeproblemhasthemeritofshortness.Letus,however,be 
in 
no 
such 
hurry, 
but 
see 
whether 
we

Ithassomanydifferentconcretemeaningsthattheuseofitasanabstractuniversalmayeasilyintroduce 



bewilderment

We 
must 
thereforebe 
careful

by 
making 
sure, 
wherever 
we 
have 
to 
employ 
it, 
what 
its 
precisemeaningisinthatparticularsphereofapplication.Atpresentwe 
have 
to 
do 
with 
space-relations, 
and 
no 
others. 
Most 
'relations' 
are 
feelings 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
order 
from 
the 
terms 
they 
relate. 
The 
relation 
of 
similarity, 
e.g., 
may 
equally 
obtain 
between 
jasmine 
and 
tuberose, 
orbetweenMr. 
Browning'sversesandMr.

Butjustas,inthefieldofquantity,therelationbetweentwonumbersisanothernumber,sointhefieldofspacetherelationsarefactsofthesameorderwiththefactstheyrelate. 
If

And 
the 
moment 
you 
have 
imagined

the

stands

in

its

no

so 
are 
the 
relations 
of 
position.Therelationofpositionbetweenthetopandbottompointsofavertical

Rightnessandleftness, 
upnessanddownness, 
areagainpure 
sensations 
differing 
specifically 
from 
each 
other, 
and 
generically 
from 
everything 
else. 
Like 
all 
sensations, 
they 
can 
only 
be 
indicated, 
not 
described. 
If 
we 
take 
a 
cube 
and

Thus 
it 
appears 
indubitable 
that 
all 
space-relations 
except 
those 
of 
magnitudearenothing 
moreorless 
thanpuresensational 
objects. 
But 
magnitudeappearstooutstepthisnarrowsphere.Weharerelationsof 
muchness 
and 
littleness 
between 
times, 
numbers, 
intensities, 
and 
qualities, 
as 
well 
as 
spaces. 
It 
is 
impossible, 
then, 
that 
such 
relations 
should 
form 
a 
particular 
kind 
of 
simply 
spatial 
feeling. 
This 
we 
must 
admit:therelationofquantityisgenericandoccursinmanycategoriesof 
consciousness, 
whilst 
the 
other 
relations 
we 
have 
considered 
are 
specific 
and 
occur 
in 
space 
alone.

Then

sticks 
out, 
as 
a

We 
seem 
thus 
to 
have 
accounted 
for 
all 
space-relations, 
and 
made 
them 
clear 
to 
our 
understanding. 
They

make 
is 
that 
they 
are 
unlikeness 
of 
place 
pure 
and 
simple. 
In 
the 
words 
of 
the 
German 
physiologist20towhopsychophysicsowesmuch: 


" 
The 
sensations 
are 
from 
the 
outset 
(von 
vornherein) 
localized. 
... 
Every 
sensation 
as 
such 
is 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
affected 
with 
the 
spatial 
quality, 
so 
that 
this 
quality 
is 
nothing 
like 
an 
external 
attribute 
comingtothesensationfromahigherfaculty,butmustberegardedassomethingimmanentlyresidinginthesensationitself." 


Andyetthemomentwereflectonthisansweraninsuperablelogicaldifficulty 
seems 
to 
present 
itself. 
No 
single 
quail 
of 
sensation 
can, 
by 
itself,amounttoaconsciousnessofposition.Supposenofeelingbutthat 
ofasinglepointevertobeawakened.Couldthatpossiblybethefeeling 
of

whereness 
or 
thereness? 
Certainly 
not. 
Only 
when 
a 
secondpointisfelttoarisecanthefirstoneacquireadeterminationofup,down,rightorleft,andthesedeterminationsareallrelativetothatsecondpoint. 
Eachpoint,sofarasitisplaced,isthenonlybyvirtueofwhatitisnot,namely,byvirtueofanotherpoint.Thisisasmuchasto 
say 
that 
position 
has 
nothing 
intrinsic 
about 
it; 
and 
that, 
although 
a 
feelingofabsolutebignessmay,afeelingofplacecannot,possiblyform 



animmanentelementinanysingleisolatedsensation. 
Theverywriter 
we 
have 
quoted 
has 
given 
heed 
to 
this 
objection, 
for 
he 
continues 
(p. 
335)bysayingthatthesensationsthusoriginallylocalized"areonlyso 
inthemselves, 
butnotintherepresentationofconsciousness, 
whichis 
not 
yet 
present 
.... 
They 
are, 
in 
the 
first 
instance, 
devoid 
of 
all 
mutual 
relations 
with 
each 
other." 
But 
such 
a 
localization 
of 
the 
sensation 
'in 
itself' 
would 
seem 
to 
mean 
nothing 
more 
than 
the 
susceptibility 
or 
potentialityofbeingdistinctlylocalizedwhenthetimecameandotherconditions 
became 
fulfilled. 
Can 
we 
now 
discover 
anything 
about 
such 
susceptibility 
in 
itself 
before 
it 
has 
borne 
its 
ulterior 
fruits 
in 
the 
developedconsciousness? 


'LocalSigns.' 


To 
begin 
with,

skin 
and 
every 
visceral

21 


"If 
with 
the 
finger 
we 
touch 
first 
the 
cheek 
and 
then 
the 
palm, 
exerting 
each 
time 
precisely 
the 
same 
pressure, 
the 
sensation 
shows 
notwithstanding 
a 
distinctly 
marked 
difference 
in 
the 
two 
cases. 
Similarly,whenwecomparethepalmwiththebackofthehand,thenapeoftheneckwithitsanteriorsurface,thebreastwiththeback;inshort, 
any 
two 
distant 
parts 
of 
the 
skin 
with 
each

and 
moreover, 
we 
easily 
remark, 
byattentively 
observing, 
that

one

we 
find

continuous 
alteration 
in 
our 
feeling, 
notwithstanding 
the 
objective 
nature 
of 
the 
contact 
has 
remained 
the 
same. 
Even 
the

and 
then

Whethertheselocalcontrastsshadeintoeachotherwithabsolutelycontinuousgradations,wecannotsay.Butweknow(continuesWundt) 
that 


"they 
change, 
when 
we 
pass 
from 
one 
point 
of 
the 
skin 
to 
its 
neighbor, 
with 
very 
different 
degrees 
of

the 
disparities 
of

are 
observable 
only 
between 
distant 
spots." 


The 
internal 
organs, 
too, 
have 
their 
specific 
qualia 
of 
sensation. 
An 
inflammation 
of 
the 
kidney 
is 
different 
from 
one 
of 
the 
liver; 
pains 
in 
joints 
and 
muscular 
insertions 
are 
distinguished. 
Pain 
in 
the 
dental 
nerves 
is 
wholly 
unlike 
the 
pain 
of 
a 
burn. 
But 
very 
important 
and 
curioussimilaritiesprevailthroughoutthesedifferences.Internalpains, 
whose

we 
cannot

Nerve-

the

of 
the 
nerve. 
Such 
localizations 
as 
those 
of 
vertical, 
frontal, 
or 
occipital 
headache 
of 
intracranial 
origin 
force 
us 
to 
conclude 
that 
parts 
which

whether

or

may

Many

affirmative;Lotze,whoinhisMedzinischePsychologie23firstdescribedthe

in 
this

designating

thus 
conceived,

localsigns.

In

that

Thus 
whenever 
an

the

excites

it

its 
concavity 
directed 
upwards 
if 
the

if

may 
be

1.TheSubdivisionoftheOriginalSense-spaces. 


How 
are 
spatial 
subdivisions 
brought 
to 
consciousness 
? 
in 
other 
words, 
How 
does 
spatial 
discrimination 
occur? 
The 
general 
subject 
of 
discriminationhasbeentreatedinapreviouschapter.Hereweneedonlyinquire 
what 
are 
the 
conditions 
that 
make 
spatial 
discrimination

Thefirstgreatconditionis,thatdifferentpointsofthesurfaceshalldifferinthequalityoftheirimmanentsensibility,thatis,thateachshallcarry 
its 
special 
local-sign. 
If 
the 
skin 
felt 
everywhere 
exactly 
alike, 
a 
foot-bath 
could 
be 
distinguished 
from 
a 
total 
immersion, 
as 
being 
smaller, 
but 
never 
distinguished 
from 
a 
wet 
face. 
The 
local-signs 
are 
indispensable;twopointswhichhavethesamelocal-signwillalwaysbefelt 
as 
the 
same 
point. 
We 
do 
not 
judge 
them 
two 
unless 
we 
have 
discerned 
their 
sensations 
to 
be 
different. 
29 
Granted 
none 
but 



homogeneous 
irritants, 
that 
organ 
would 
then 
distinguish 
the

great 
part 
of 
the 
minutenesswithwhichweareabletosubdividethetotalbignessofthesensationityields.Onitsperipherythelocaldifferencesdonotshadeoffveryrapidly,andwecancounttherefewersubdivisions. 


But 
these 
local 
differences 
of 
feeling, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
surface 
is 
unexcited 
from 
without, 
are 
almost 
null.

The 
local

require 
then, 
an

superinduced 
upon 
them, 
to 
awaken 
the

Of

the 
totality 
of 
its 
respective

each

with 
the 
whole 
vastness 
given 
by 
that 
organ, 
and

I 
should 
have 
been 
wining 
some 
years 
ago 
to 
name 
with-out 
hesitation 
a 
third 
condition 
of 
discrimination-saying 
it 
would 
be 
most 
developed 
in 
that 
organ 
which 
is 
susceptible 
of 
the 
most 
various 
qualities 
of 
feeling. 
The 
retina 
is 
un-questionably 
such 
an 
organ. 
The 
colors 
and 
shades 
it 
perceives 
are 
infinitely 
more 
numerous 
than 
the 
diversities 
of 
skin-sensation. 
And 
it 
can 
feel 
at 
once 
white 
and 
black, 
whilst 
the 
ear 
can 
in 
nowise 
so 
feel 
sound 
and 
silence. 
But 
the 
late 
researchesofDonaldson,Blix,andGoldscheider,31onspecificpointsforheat, 
cold, 
pressure, 
and 
pain 
in 
the

disinclinemetomakemuchofthisconditionnow.32Thereis,however, 
one 
quality 
of 
sensation 
which 
is 
particularly 
exciting, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
feeling 
of 
motion 
over 
any 
of 
our 
surfaces. 
The 
erection 
of 
this 
into 
a 
separate 
elementary 
quality 
of 
sensibility 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
of 
psychologicalachievements,andisworthyofdetainingusawhileatthispoint.

A

observation 
by

34 
completes 
the 
proof 
that

in 
a 
primitive 
form 
of

by

Vierordt, 
at 
almost 
the 
same 
time, 
35 
called 
attention 
to 
certain 
persistent 
illusions, 
amongst 
which 
arethese: 
If

as 
if 
they 
were 
actively 
separating 
from 
the 
rest. 
These 
illusions, 
according 
to 
Vierordt, 
are 
survivals 
of 
a 
primitive 
form 
of 
perception, 
when 
motion 
was 
felt 
as 
such, 
but 
ascribed 
to 
the 
whole 
content 
of 
consciousness,andnotyetdistinguishedasbelongingexclusivelytooneof 
its 
parts. 
When 
our 
perception 
is 
fully 
developed 
we 
go 
beyond 
the 
mere 
relative 
motion 
of 
thing 
and 
Bound, 
and 
can 
ascribe 
absolute 
motiontooneofthesecomponentsofourtotalobject,andabsoluterestto 
another. 
When, 
in

for

Even 
when

the 
primitive

persists 
under 
the 
victorious 
conception. 
If

we

But 
the 
most 
valuable 
contribution 
to 
the 
subject 
is 
the 
paper 
of 
G. 
H. 
Schneider, 
36 
who 
takes 
up 
the

and

But 
it 
is 
worthyofnotethatsuchperceptionisbestdevelopedontheskinofthemost

(the 
labors 
of 
Vierordt 
and 
his

is 
exceptionallydiscriminative,itseemstohavebecomesothroughtheinveteratehabitwhichmostofthempossessoftwitchingandmovingitunderwhateverobjectmaytouchthem,soastobecomebetteracquaintedwiththeconformation 
of

Czermak 
was 
the 
first 
to 
notice 
this. 
It 
may 
be 
easily 
verified. 
Of 
course 
movement 
of 
surface 
under 
object 
is 
(forpurposesofstimulation)equivalenttomovementofobjectoversurface.
In 
exploring 
the 
shapes 
and 
sizes 
of 
things 
by 
either 
eye 
or 
skin 
the 
movementsoftheseorgansareincessantandunrestrainable.Everysuch

the 
points 
and 
lines 
of 
the 
object 
across 
the

imprintsthemahundredtimesmoresharply,anddrivesthemhometothe 
attention. 
The 
immense 
part 
thus 
played 
by 
movements 
in 
our 
perceptive 
activity 
is 
held 
by 
many 
psychologists 
39 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
muscles 
are 
themselves 
the 
space-perceiving 
organ. 
Not

The 
first 
thing 
that 
seems 
evident 
is 
that 
we 
have 
no 
immediate 
powerofcomparingtogetherwithanyaccuracytheextentsrevealedbydifferentsensations.Ourmouth-cavityfeelsindeedtoitselfsmaller,and 
to 
the 
tongue 
larger, 
than 
it 
feels 
to 
the

or

our

membrane 
feels

our

Thusareexactequivalenciesandcommonmeasuresintroduced,andthewaypreparedfornumericalresults. 


Could 
wenotsuperpose 
one 
part 
ofour 
skin

or 
one

on 
both

we 
should

that 
knowledgeofourownformwhichwepossess.Theoriginaldifferencesofbignessofourdifferentpartswouldremainvaguelyoperative,andweshouldhavenocertaintyastohowmuchlipwasequivalenttosomuchforehead,howmuchfingertosomuchback. 


Butwiththepowerofexploringonepartofthesurfacebyanother 
we 
get 
a 
direct 
perception 
of 
cutaneous 
equivalencies. 
The 
primitivedifferencesofbignessareover-poweredwhenwefeelbyanimmediatesensation 
that

Andwhenamotionoftheoppositefinger-tips 
draws 
a 
line 
first 
along 
this 
same 
length 
of 
thigh 
and 
then 
along 
the 
wholeofthe 
hand 
in

weget 
anew 
mannerof 
measurement, 
less 
direct 
but 
confirming 
the 
equivalencies 
established 
by 
the 
first. 
In 
theseways,bysuperpositionsofpartsandbytracinglinesondifferentpartsbyidenticalmovements,apersondeprivedofsightcansoonlearnto

In 
these 
reductions 
it 
is 
to 
be 
noticed 
that 
when 
the

sensations 
of

of

We 
can 
usually 
recover 
anything 
lost 
from 
sight 
by 
moving 
our 
attentionandoureyesbackinitsdirection;andthroughtheseconstantchanges 
every 
field 
of 
seen 
things 
comes 
at 
last 
to 
be 
thought 
of 
as 
alwayshavingafringeofotherthingspossibletobeseenspreadinginalldirectionsroundaboutit.Meanwhilethemovementsconcomitantlywithwhich 
the 
various 
fields 
alternate 
are 
also 
felt 
and 
remembered; 
and 
gradually 
(through 
association) 
this 
and 
that 
movement 
come 
in 
our 
thought 
to 
suggest 
this 
or 
that 
extent 
of 
fresh 
objects 
introduced. 
Gradually, 
too, 
since 
the 
objects 
vary 
indefinitely 
in 
kind, 
we 
abstract 
fromtheirseveralnaturesandthinkseparatelyoftheirmereextents,ofwhich 
extents 
the 
various 
movements 
remain 
as 
the 
only 
constant 
introducers 
and 
associates. 
More 
and 
more, 
therefore, 
do 
we 
think 
of 
movement 
and 
seen 
extent 
as 
mutually 
involving? 
each

until 
at 
last(withBainandJ.S.Mill)wemaygettoregardthemassynonymous, 
andsay,"Whatisthemeaningofthewordextent,unlessitbepossiblemovement?" 
46 
We 
forget 
in 
this 
conclusion 
that 
(whatever 
intrinsic 
extensiveness 
the 
movements 
may 
appear 
endowed 
with), 
that 
seen 
spreadoutnesswhichisthepatternoftheabstractextensivenesswhichweimaginecametousoriginallyfromtheretinalsensation. 


The 
muscular 
sensations 
of 
the 
eyeball 
signify 
this 
sort 
of 
visible 
spreadoutness, 
just 
as 
this 
visible 
spreadoutness 
may 
come 
in 
later 
experience 
to 
signify 
the 
'real' 
bulks, 
distances, 
lengths 
and 
breadths 
known 
to 
touch 
and 
locomotion. 
47 
To 
the 
very 
end, 
however 
in 
us 
seeing 
men, 
the 
quality, 
the 
nature, 
the 
sort 
of 
thing 
we 
mean 
by 
extensiveness, 
would 
seem 
to 
be 
the 
sort 
of 
feeling 
which 
our 
retinal 
stimulationsbring.

1.FeelingsofMovementinJoints 


I 
have 
been 
led 
to 
speak 
of 
feelings 
which 
arise 
in

Itwouldseemtofollow,ifthistheoryweretrue,

more

It 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
no 
evidence 
of 
the 
muscular 
measurements 
in 



question 
exists; 
but 
that 
all 
the 
facts 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
surfacesensibility,
providedwetakethatofthejoint-surfacesalsointoaccount.
The 
most 
striking 
argument, 
and 
the 
most 
obvious 
one, 
which 
an 
upholderofthemusculartheoryislikelytoproduceisundoubtedlythisfact: 
if, 
with 
closed

we 
trace

in

Shouldwebetemptedtoobjecttothissuppositionoftheadvocateofperception

that 
we 
have 
learned 
the 
spatial 
significance 
of 
the

by 
reiterated 
experiences 
of 
seeing 
what

sothatin 
the 
last 
resort 
the 
muscular 
space 
feelings 
would 
be 
derived 
from 
retinal-surface 
feelings, 
our 
opponent 
might 
immediately 
hush 
us 
by 
pointing 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
in

That

obvious 
from 
the

That 
the 
joint-surfaces 
are 
sensitive 
appears 
evident 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
inflammation 
they 
become 
the 
seat 
of 
excruciating 
pains,

Since 
Lewinski's 
paper 
an 
important 
experimental 
research 
by 
A. 
Goldscheider54hasappeared, 
whichcompletelyestablishesourpoint.
Thispatientobservercausedhisfingers,arms,andlegstobepassivelyrotated 
upon 
their 
various 
joints 
in 
a 
mechanical 
apparatus 
which 
registeredboththevelocityofmovementimpressedandtheamountofangularrotation.Noactivemuscularcontractiontookplace.Theminimalfeltamountsofrotationwereinallcasessurprisinglysmall,beingmuchless

joints 
except 
those 
of 
the 
fingers.Suchdisplacementsasthese,theauthorsays(p.490),canhardly 
be 
detected 
by 
the 
eye. 
The 
point 
of 
application 
of 
the 
force 
which 
rotated 
the 
limb 
made 
nodifference 
in 
the 
result. 
Rotations

hip-joint,forexample,wereasdelicatelyfeltwhenthelegwashungbytheheelaswhenitwashungbythethighwhilstthemovementswereperformed.Anæsthesiaoftheskinproducedbyinduction-currentsalsohadnodisturbingeffectontheperception,nordidthevariousdegreesofpressureofthemovingforceupontheskinaffectit.Itbecame,infact,all 
the 
more 
distinct 
in 
proportion 
as 
the 
concomitant 
pressure-feelings 
were 
eliminated 
by 
artificial 
anæsthesia. 
When 
the 
joints 
themselves, 
however, 
were 
made 
artificially 
anæsthetic 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
movement 
grew 
obtuse 
and 
the 
angular 
rotations 
had 
to 
be 
much 
increasedbeforetheywereperceptible. 
Allthesefactsproveaccording 
to 
Herr 
Goldscheider, 
that 
the 
joint 
surfaces 
and 
these 
alone 
are 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
the 
impressions 
by 
which 
the 
movements 
of 
our 
membersareimmediatelyperceived. 


Applying 
this 
result, 
which 
seems 
invulnerable, 
to 
the 
case 
of 
the 
tracing 
finger-tip, 
we 
see 
that 
our 
perception 
of 
the 
latter 
gives 
no 
countenancetothetheoryofthemuscularsense.Weindubitablylocalize 



the 
finger-tip 
at 
the 
successive 
points 
of 
its 
path 
by 
means 
of 
the 
sensationswhichwereceivefromourjoints.Butifthisisso,itmaybeasked,whydowefeelthefiguretobetraced,notwithinthejointitself,
butinsuchanaltogetherdifferentplace?Andwhydowefeelitsomuchlargerthanitreallyis? 


I 
will 
answer 
these 
questions 
by 
asking 
another: 
Why 
do 
we 
move 
ourjoistsatall?Surelytogainsomethingmorevaluablethantheinsipidjoint-feelingsthemselves.Andthesemoreinterestingfeelingsareinthemainproducedupontheskinofthemovingpart,orofsomeotherpartoverwhichitpasses,orupontheeye.Withmovementsofthefingersweexploretheconfigurationofallrealobjectswithwhichwehavetodeal, 
our 
own

as 
foreign 
things. 
Nothing 
that

locatedinthejoint;everythingthatinterestsuseitherissomepartofourskin, 
orissomethingthatweseeaswehandleit. 
Thecutaneouslyfeltandtheseenextentscomethustofigureastheimportantthingsforusto 
concern 
ourselves 
with. 
Every 
time 
the 
joint 
moves, 
even 
though 
we 
neither 
see, 
nor 
feel 
cutaneously, 
the 
reminiscence 
of 
skin-events 
and 
sights 
which 
formerly 
coincided 
with 
that 
extent 
of 
movement, 
ideally 
awakenasthemovement'simport,andtheminddropsthepresentsigntoattendtotheimportalone.Thejoint-sensationitself,assuch,doesnot 
disappear 
in 
the 
process. 
A 
little 
attention 
easily 
detects 
it, 
with 
all 
its 
fine 
peculiarities, 
hidden 
beneath 
its 
vaster 
suggestions; 
so 
that 
really 
the 
mind 
has 
two 
space-perceptions 
before 
it, 
congruent 
in 
form 
but 
differentinscaleandplace,eitherofwhichexclusivelyitmaynotice,orbothatonce,--thejoint-spacewhichitfeelsandtherealspacewhichit

in 
the 
feeling 
of 
a 
peculiar 
direction? 
55 
Why 
may 
not 
the 
several 
joint-feelings 
be 
so 
many 
perceptions 
of 
movement 
in 
so 
many 
different 
directions? 
That 
we 
cannotexplainwhytheyshouldisnopresumptionthattheydonot,forwenevercanexplainwhyanysense-organshouldawakenthesensationitdoes. 


But 
if 
the

therefore,morejoint-difference=moreskin-difference.Infact,thejointfeeling

which 
the

at 
its 
pleasure 
with

that

When 
the 
joint-feeling 
in 
itself 
acquires 
an 
emotional 
interest, 
-which 
happens

Forthisopinionmanyreasonscanbeassigned.First,itseemsaprioriimprobablethat

AsG. 
E. 
Müllersays,

and 
in 
neither 
case 
can 
the 
excitement 
be 
proportionate 
to

depends 
on 
the 
previous 
work 
more 
than 
on 
the 
actually 
present 
contraction; 
and 
the 
internal 
pressure 
of 
it 
depends 
on 
the 
resistance 
offered 
more 
than 
on 
the 
shortening

The 
intrinsic

are 
likely 
therefore 
to 
be 
merely 
those 
of 
massive

They

When

merely

of

all

Reasoning 
is 
always 
for 
a 
subjective 
interest, 
to 
attain 
some 
particular 
conclusion, 
or 
to 
gratify 
some 
special 
curiosity.

The

of 
reasoning

her 
to

with 
the 
total

of

A 
reasoning 
man, 
however, 
would 
open 
the

by 
first 
analyzing 
the

But 
my 
procedure 
is 
a 
mere 
association 
of 
two 
totals, 
diseased

and

One

have

thence 
inferred

Thus,ThereAreTwoGreatPointsinReasoning 


First, 
an 
extracted 
character 
is 
taken 
as 
equivalent 
to 
the 
entire 
documentfromwhichitcomes;and, 


Second, 
the 
character 
thus 
taken 
suggests

The

But 
these

are 
all 
mere 
extracted 
portions 
or 
circumstances 
singled 
out 
from 
the 
mass 
of 
characters 
which 
make 
up 
the 
entire

And, 
now, 
to

the

The

"Why

But,

In 
this 
vague 
way, 
probably, 
does 
the 
room 
appear 
to 
the 
babe 
who 
first 
begins 
to 
be 
conscious 
of 
it 
as 
something 
other 
than 
his

Familiarity

Such

But 
the 
sailor, 
the 
fireman, 
and 
the 
general 
know 
directly 
at 
what 
corner 
to 
take 
up 
the 
business. 
They 
'see 
into 
the 
situation 
--that 
is, 
they 
analyze 
it 
--with 
their 
first 
glance. 
It 
is 
full 
of 
delicately 
differenced 
ingredients 
which 
their 
education 
has 
little 
by 
little 
brought 
to 
their 
consciousness, 
but 
of 
which 
the 
novice 
gains 
no 
clearidea. 


How 
this 
power 
of 
analysis 
was 
brought 
about 
we 
saw 
in 
our 
chaptersonDiscriminationandAttention.Wedissociatetheelementsof 
originallyvaguetotalsbyattendingtothemornoticingthemalternately,
ofcourse. 
Butwhatdetermineswhichelementweshallattendtofirst? 
There 
are 
two 
immediate 
and 
obvious 
answers 
: 
first, 
our 
practical 
or 
instinctiveinterests;and,second,ouræstheticinterests.Thedogsingles 
out 
of 
any 
situation 
its 
smells, 
and 
the 
horse 
its 
sounds, 
because 
they 
may 
reveal 
facts 
of 
practical 
moment, 
and 
are 
instinctively 
exciting 
to 
these 
several 
creatures. 
The 
infant 
notices 
the 
candle-flame 
or 
the 
window,andignorestherestoftheroom,becausethoseobjectsgivehim 
a 
vivid 
pleasure. 
So, 
the 
country 
boy 
dissociates 
the 
blackberry, 
the 
chestnut,andthewintergreen,fromthevaguemassofothershrubsandtrees,fortheirpracticaluses,andthesavageisdelightedwiththebeads,
the 
bits 
of 
looking-glass, 
brought 
by 
an 
exploring 
vessel, 
and 
gives 
no 
heed 
to 
the 
features 
of 
the 
vessel 
itself, 
which 
is 
too 
much 
beyond 
his 
sphere. 
Theseæsthetic 
and 
practical 
interests, 
then, 
are 
the 
weightiest 
factors 
in 
making 
particular 
ingredients 
stand 
out 
in 
high 
relief. 
What 
theylaytheiraccenton,thatwenotice;butwhattheyareinthemselves, 
we 
cannot 
say. 
We 
must 
content 
ourselves 
here 
with 
simply 
accepting 
them 
as 
irreducible 
ultimate 
factors 
in 
determining 
the 
way 
our 
knowledgegrows. 



Now, 
a 
creature 
which 
has 
few 
instinctive 
impulses, 
or 
interests, 
practical 
or 
æsthetic, 
will 
dissociate 
few 
characters, 
and 
will, 
at 
best, 
have 
limited 
reasoning 
powers; 
whilst

would,

dint

to

more

than 
any

A 
friend 
of 
the 
writer 
gave 
as 
a 
proof 
of 
the 
almost 
human 
intelligenceofhisdogthathetookhimonedaydowntohisboatontheshore,butfoundtheboatfullofdirtandwater.Herememberedthatthe 
spongewasupatthehouse,athirdofatmiledistant;but,dislikingtogoback

he 
made 
various 
gestures 
of 
wiping 
out 
the 
boat 
and 
so 
forth,sayingtohisterrier,"Sponge,sponge;gofetchthesponge."Buthe 
had 
little 
expectation 
of 
a 
result, 
since 
the 
dog 
had 
never 
received 
the 
slightesttrainingwiththeboatorthesponge.Nevertheless,offhetrottedtothehouse,and,tohisowner'sgreatsurpriseandadmiration,brought 
the 
sponge 
in 
his 
jaws. 
Sagacious 
as 
this 
was, 
it 
required 
nothing 
but 
ordinary 
contiguous 
association 
of 
ideas. 
The 
terrier 
was 
only 
exceptional 
in 
the 
minuteness 
of 
his 
spontaneous 
observation. 
Most 
terrierswouldhavetakennointerestintheboat-cleaningoperation,nornoticed 
what 
the

was

This 
terrier, 
in 
having 
picked 
thosedetailsoutofthecrudemassofhisbest-experiencedistinctlyenoughtobe

was 
truly

he 
had 
brought

Such 
a 
substitution 
would 
have 
shown 
that, 
embedded 
in 
the 
very 
different 
appearances 
of 
these 
articles, 
he 
had 
been 
able 
to 
discriminate 
the 
identical 
partial 
attri-bute 
of 
capacity 
to 
take 
up

and 
had 
reflected, 
"Forthe

If 
the

will 
take 
the 
trouble 
to 
analyze 
the 
best 
dog 
and 
elephant 
stories 
he 
knows, 
he 
will 
find 
that, 
in 
most 
cases, 
this 
simple 
contiguous 
calling 
up 
of 
one 
whole 
by 
another 
is 
quite 
sufficient 
to 
explain 
the 
phenomena. 
Sometimes, 
it 
is 
true, 
we 
have 
to 
suppose 
the 
recognition 
of 
a 
property 
or 
character 
as 
such,

it 
is 
then 
always 
a

Intelligent 
dogs 
recognize 
by 
the 
tone 
of 
the 
master's 
voice 
whether 
the 
latter 
is 
angry 
or 
not. 
A 
dog 
will 
perceive 
whether 
you 
have 
kicked 
him 
by 
accident 
or 
by

and 
behave

Thus,

are 
very 
few,

but 
an 
acquaintancewithallthecircumstancesshowittohavebeenarandomtricklearnedbyhabit.Thestoryisasfollows: 


"I 
have 
two 
dogs, 
a 
small, 
long-legged 
pet 
dog 
and 
a

large

he

himself 
before 
the

and 
barked. 
Immediately 
the 
large 
dog 
in 
the

would 
hasten 
to 
him

raise 
the 
latch 
with 
his

Imightsay,

Whilethelargedogwas

"The

But, 
now,

it

But 
as, 
according 
to 
our

there 
are 
two

in

The 
first 
are 
the 
abstract 
reasoners,

the

of

are 
the

in

the

of

to 
the 
scientific 
stage 
(the

of

may 
often 
be

An 
often-quoted 
writer 
has 
said 
that 
Shakespeare

so 
stir 
the 
spectator's 
blood 
and 
leave 
him 
with 
a 
sense 
of 
reconcilement? 
Shakespeare 
himself 
could 
very 
likely 
not 
say 
why; 
for 
hisinvention,thoughrational,wasnotratiocinative.Wishingthecurtain 
to 
fall 
upon 
a 
reinstated 
Othello, 
that 
speech 
about 
the 
turbaned 
Turk 
suddenly 
simply 
hashed 
across 
him 
as 
the 
right 
end 
of

But 
Shakespeare, 
whose 
mind 
supplied 
these 
means, 
could 
probably 
not 
have 
told 
why 
they 
were 
so 
effective. 
But 
though 
this 
is 
true, 
and 
though 
it 
would 
be 
absurd 
in 
an 
absolute

to

Dr.

with

after 
which 
God 
performs 
the 
cure 
if

Him." 
"Well," 
rejoined 
the 
savage, 
"it

just

Or 
we 
answer 
the 
question: 
"Why

by

"For

is 
used 
to

After

all

that 
of 
indeterminateness 
of

and 
tendency 
of 
action 
to 
focalize

I 
see 
no 
need 
of 
assuming 
more 
than 
two 
terms 
in 
this

maybe 
complex,

essentially 
it 
is

A

up 
B,

no

involved. 
M. 
Binet, 
in 
his

little 
book,

maintains 
that 
there 
are 
three

I 
still 
continue

These 
are: 
first, 
the

of

When 
a

he 
utters 
his

interjection; 
or 
when 
(to

that 
the

a

Now,

of 
the

utter

he 
feels

as

Immediately 
it

the

to

of 
the 
higher 
senses 
produce, 
according 
to 
Couty 
and 
Charpentier, 
the 
most 
varied 
effects 
upon 
the 
pulse-rate 
and

The 
dynamogenic 
value 
of 
simple 
musical

to 
be

to 
their

Where

A

TwoPrinciplesofNon-UniformityinInstincts. 


Wereonedevisinganabstractscheme,nothingwouldbeeasierthan 
to 
discover 
from 
an 
animal's 
actions 
just 
how 
many 
instincts 
he 
possessed. 
He 
would 
react 
in 
one 
way 
only 
upon 
each 
class 
of 
objects 
with 
which 
his 
life 
had 
to 
deal; 
he 
would 
react 
in 
identically 
the 
same 
way 
upon 
every 
specimen 
of 
a 
class; 
and 
he 
would 
react 
invariably 
during 
his 
whole 
life. 
There 
would 
be 
no 
gaps 
among 
his 
instincts; 
all 
would 
come 
to 
light 
without 
perversion 
or 
disguise. 
But 
there 
are 
no 
such 
abstract 
animals, 
and 
no-where

but 
two 
other 
principles 
of 
which 
we 
have 
not 
yet

may 
come 
into 
play 
and 
produce 
results 
so 
striking 
that 
observers 
as 



eminent 
as

do 
not

to 
call 
them'derangementsofthementalconstitution,'andtoconcludethatthe

Whenobjectsofacertainclasselicitfromananimalacertainsortofreaction, 
it 
often 
happens 
that 
the 
animal 
becomes 
partial 
to 
the 
first 
specimen 
of 
the 
class 
on 
which 
it 
has 
reacted, 
and 
will

born 
on

a

in 
December, 
and 
transferred 
six 
weeks 
later 
to 
a,

when 
he 
was 
less

AsimilarinstanceisgivenbyDr.H.D.Schmidt10ofNewOrleans: 


"I 
may 
cite 
the 
example 
of 
a 
young 
squirrel 
which 
I 
had 
tamed, 
a 
numberofyearsago,whenservinginthearmy,andwhenIhadsufficientleisure;andopportunitytostudythehabitsofanimals.

Now, 
as 
regards 
the 
young 
squirrel, 
which, 
of 
course, 
never 
had 
been 
present 
at 
the 
burial 
of 
a 
nut, 
I 
observed 
that, 
after 
having 
eaten 
a 
number 
of 
hickory-nuts 
to 
appease 
its 
appetite, 
it 
would 
take

--in 
the 
air 
; 
after 
which 
it 
would 
jump 
away, 
leaving 
the 
nut, 
of 
course,uncovered." 


The 
anecdote, 
of 
course, 
illustrates 
beautifully 
the 
close 
relation 
of 
instinct 
to 
reflex 
action 
--a 
particular 
perception 
calls 
forth 
particular 
movements, 
and 
that 
is 
all. 
Dr. 
Schmidt 
writes 
me 
that 
the 
squirrel 
in 
question 
soon 
passed 
away 
from 
his 
observation. 
It 
may 
fairly 
be 
presumedthat,ifhehadbeenlongretainedprisonerinacage,hewouldsoonhaveforgottenhisgesticulationsoverthehickory-nuts.

on 
the

it 
is 
safe 
to 
say 
that 
the 
mode 
of 



development 
of 
these 
locomotor 
instincts 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
account 
given 
by 
the 
older 
English 
associationist 
school, 
of 
their 
being 
results 
of 
the 
individual's 
education, 
due 
altogether 
to 
the 
gradual 
association 
of 
certain 
perceptions 
with 
certain 
hap-hazard

Mr.

observations 
on 
this 
point 
are 
conclusive 
as 
to 
birds. 


"Birds,"

Sympathy 
is 
an 
emotion 
as 
to 
whose 
instinctiveness 
psychologists 
have 
held 
hot 
debate, 
some 
of 
them 
contending 
that 
it 
is 
no 
primitiveendowment,but,originallyatleast,theresultofarapidcalculationofthegood 
consequences 
to 
ourselves 
of 
the 
sympathetic 
act. 
Such 
a 
calculation, 
at 
first 
conscious, 
would 
grow 
more 
unconscious 
as 
it 
becamemorehabitual,andatlast,traditionandassociationaiding,mightprompt 
to 
actions 
which 
could 
not 
be 
distinguished 
from 
immediate 
impulses. 
It 
is 
hardly 
needful 
to 
argue 
against 
the 
falsity 
of 
this 
view. 
Some 
forms 
of 
sympathy, 
that 
of 
mother 
with 
child, 
for 
example, 
are

Danger 
to 
the 
child 
blindly 
and 
instantaneously 
stimulates 
the 
mother 
to 
actions 
of 
alarm 
or 
defence. 
Menace 
or 
harm 
to 
the 
adult 
beloved 
or 
friend 
excites 
us 
in 
a 
correspondingway,oftenagainstallthedictatesofprudence. 
Itistrue

does 
not

Be 
this 
as 
it 
may, 
fear 
is 
a 
genuine 
instinct, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
shownbythe]lumenchild.Noisesseemespeciallytocallitforth. 
Most 
noisesfromtheouterworld,toachildbredinthehouse,havenoexactsignificance. 
They 
are 
simply 
startling. 
To 
quote 
a 
good 
observer, 
M. 
Perez: 


"Children

three

but 
smiled 
at 
the 
woman 
who 
was 
taking 
care 
of 
him, 
while 
his 
parents 
were 
busy. 
The 
noise, 
however, 
of 
the

Thusfearcomesratherbytheearsthanbytheeyes, 
tothe

It 
is 
natural 
that 
this 
should 
be 
reversed, 
or 
reduced, 
in 
animals 
organized 
to 
perceive 
danger 
afar. 
Accordingly,
althoughIhaveneverseenachildfrightenedathisfirstsightoffire,

The 
effect 
of 
noise 
in 
heightening 
any 
terror 
we 
may 
feel 
in 
adult 
yearsisverymarked.Thehowlingofthestorm,whetheronseaorland, 
is 
a 
principal 
cause 
of 
our 
anxiety 
when 
exposed 
to 
it. 
The 
writer 
has 
been 
interested 
in 
noticing 
in 
his 
own 
person, 
while 
lying 
in 
bed, 
and 
kept 
awake 
by 
the 
wind 
outside, 
how 
invariably 
each 
loud 
gust 
of 
it 
arrested 
momentarily 
his 
heart.

Strangemen,andstrangeanimals,eitherlargeorsmall,excitefear,

Thisisentirelyinstinctiveandantecedenttoexperience.Somechildren 
will 
cry 
with

at 
their

to

It 
is 
impossible 
to 
say 
how 
much 
of 
this

is 
instinctive 
and 
how

without

But

although

The 
great 
source 
of 
terror 
to 
infancy 
is 
solitude. 
The

Blackthings,andespeciallydarkplaces,holes,caverns,etc.,arouseapeculiarlygruesomefear. 
Thisfear,aswellasthatofsolitude,ofbeing 
'lost,' 
are 
explained 
after 
a, 
fashion 
by 
ancestral 
experience. 
Says 
Schneider:

High

fear 
of 
a

The

to

in

certainly

Allsimpleactivegamesareattemptstogainthe 
excitement 
yielded 
by 
certain 
primitiveinstincts, 
through 
feigning 
that 
the 
occasions 
for 
their 
exercise 
are 
there. 
They 
involve 
imitation,
hunting,fighting,rivalry,acquisitiveness,andconstruction,combinedinvarious 
ways; 
their 
special 
rules 
are 
habits, 
discovered 
by 
accident, 



selected 
by 
intelligence, 
and 
propagated 
by 
tradition; 
but 
unless 
they 
were 
founded 
in 
automatic 
impulses, 
games 
would 
lose 
most 
of 
their 
zest. 
The 
sexes 
differ 
somewhat 
in 
their 
play-impulses. 
As 
Schneider 
says: 


"The 
little 
boy

while 
with 
the

the

is

case, 
is 
proof 
that 
an 
hereditary 
connection 
exists 
between 
the 
perception 
of 
certain 
things 
(horse, 
doll, 
etc.), 
and 
the 
feeling 
of 
pleasure, 
as 
well 
as 
between 
this

An

AsMr. 
Darwinobserves, 
arealdreadofdefiniteconsequencesmay 
enter 
into 
this 
'stage-fright' 
and 
complicate 
the

Even 
so 
our

Cleanliness 
. 
Seeing 
how 
very 
filthy 
savages 
and 
exceptional 
individuals 
among 
civilized 
peoplemay 
be, 
philosophers 
havedoubted 
whether 
any 
genuine 
instinct 
of 
cleanliness 
exists, 
and 
whether 
education 
and 
habit 
be 
not 
responsible 
for 
whatever 
amount 
of 
it 
is 
found. 
Were 
it 
an 
instinct, 
its 
stimulus 
would 
be 
dirt, 
and 
its 
characteristic 
reaction 
the 
shrinking 
from 
contact 
therewith, 
and 
the 
cleaningofitawayaftercontacthadoccurred.Now,ifsomeanimalsare

But 
none 
of

the 
impulse 
never

ourselves 
is 
a 
law 
of 
our 
æsthetic 
nature 
about 
which

be 
no

But 
as

thing, 
it 
is 
shyness, 
the 
feeling 
of 
dread 
that 
unfamiliar 
persons, 
as 
explained 
above, 
may 
inspire 
us 
withal. 
Such 
persons 
are

stimulitoourmodesty.34Buttheactionsofmodestyarequitedifferentfromtheactionsofshyness.Theyconsistoftherestraintofcertainbodilyfunctions, 
and 
of 
the 
covering 
of 
certain 
parts; 
and 
why 
do 
such 
particular 
actions 
necessarily 
ensue? 
That 
there 
may 
be 
in 
the 
human 
animal, 
as 
such, 
a 
'blind' 
and 
immediate 
automatic 
impulse 
to 
such 
restraints 
and 
coverings 
in 
respect-inspiring 
presences 
is 
a 
possibility 
difficultofactualdisproof.Butitseemsmorelikely,fromthefacts,that 
the 
actions 
of 
modesty 
are 
suggested 
to 
us 
in 
a 
roundabout 
way; 
and 
that,evenmorethanthoseofcleanliness,theyarisefromtheapplicationinthesecondinstancetoourselvesofjudgmentsprimarilypassedupon

It 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
believe 
that, 
even 
among 
the 
nakedest 
savages, 
an 
unusualdegree 
of 
cynicism

must 
inspire 
some 
respect, 
and 
that 
persons 
who 
suffer 
every 
liberty 
are 
persons 
whom 
others 
disregard. 
Not 
to 
be 
like 
such 
people, 
then, 
would 
be 
one 
of 
the

25(1) 
The 
Emotions. 


In 
speaking 
of 
the 
instincts 
it 
has 
been 
impossible 
to 
keep 
them 
separatefromtheemotionalexcitementswhichgowiththem.Objectsof 
rage, 
love, 
fear, 
etc., 
not 
only 
prompt 
a 
man 
to 
outward 
deeds, 
but 
provoke 
characteristic 
alterations 
in 
his 
attitude 
and 
visage, 
and 
affect 
his 
breathing, 
circulation, 
andotherorganicfunctionsin 
specific 
ways. 
When 
the 
outward 
deeds 
are 
inhibited, 
these 
latter 
emotional 
expressionsstillremain, 
andwereadtheangerintheface,thoughthe 
blow 
may 
not 
be 
struck, 
and 
the 
fear 
betrays 
itself 
in 
voice 
and 
color, 
though 
one 
may 
suppress 
all 
other 
sign. 
Instinctive 
reactions 
and 
emotionalexpressionsthusshadeimperceptiblyintoeachother. 
Every 
object 
that 
excites 
an 
instinct 
excites 
an 
emotion 
as 
well. 
Emotions, 
however, 
fall 
short 
of 
instincts, 
in 
that 
the 
emotional 
reaction 
usually 
terminates 
in 
the 
subject's 
own 
body, 
whilst 
the 
instinctive 
reaction 
is 
apt 
to 
go 
farther 
and 
enter 
into 
practical 
relations 
with 
the 
exciting 
object. 


Emotionalreactionsareoftenexcitedbyobjectswithwhichwehave 
no 
practical 
dealings. 
A 
ludicrous 
object, 
for 
example, 
or 
a 
beautiful 
object 
are 
not 
necessarily 
objects 
to 
which 
we 
do 
anything; 
we 
simply 
laugh,orstandinadmiration,asthecasemaybe.Theclassofemotional, 
is 
thus 
rather 
larger 
than 
that 
of 
instinctive, 
impulses, 
commonly 
so 
called. 
Its 
stimuli 
are 
more 
numerous, 
and 
its 
expressions 
are 
more 
internalanddelicate,andoftenlesspractical.Thephysiologicalplanandessenceofthetwoclassesofimpulse,however,isthesame.

A

however,oughttofindaplacehere.LetmebeginwiththemanifestationsofGriefasaDanishphysiologist,C.Lange,describesthem:2 


"The

(as 
in 
all

movements 
are 
made 
slowly, 
heavily, 
without 
strength, 
unwillingly, 
and 
with 
exertion, 
and 
are 
limited 
to 
the 
fewest 
possible. 
Bythisthegrievingpersongetshisoutwardstamp:hewalks

Hisvoice 
is 
weakandwithoutresonance,inconsequenceofthefeebleactivityofthemuscles 
of 
expiration 
and 
of 
the 
larynx. 
He 
prefers 
to 
sit 
still, 
sunk 
in 
himselfandsilent. 
Thetonicityor 
'latentinnervation'ofthemusclesis 
strikinglydiminished. 
Theneckisbent, 
theheadhangs('boweddown' 
withgrief),therelaxationofthecheek-andjaw-musclesmakestheface

The 
eyes 
appearlarge,asisalwaysthecasewheretheorbicularismuscleisparalyzed,butthey 
may 
often 
be 
partly 
covered 
by 
the 
upper 
lid 
which 
droops 
in 
consequence 
of 
the 
laming 
of 
its 
own 
levator. 
With 
this 
condition 
of 
weakness 
of 
the 
voluntary 
nerve-and 
muscle-apparatus 
of 
the 
whole 
body, 
there 
coexists, 
as 
aforesaid, 
just 
as 
in 
all 
states 
of 
similar 
motor 
weakness,asubjectivefeelingofwearinessandheaviness,ofsomethingwhich 
weighs 
upon 
one; 
one 
feels 
'downcast,'

like 
Romeo 
in 
the 
monk'scell,throwthemselvesupontheearthintheirdespair. 


"Butthisweaknessoftheentirevoluntarymotorapparatus(thesocalled 
apparatus 
of 
'animal' 
life) 
is 
only 
one 
side 
of 
the 
physiology 
of 
grief. 
Another 
side, 
hardly 
less 
important, 
and 
in 
its 
consequences 
perhaps 
even 
more 
so, 
belongs 
to 
another 
subdivision 
of 
the 
motor 
apparatus,namely,theinvoluntaryor'organic'muscles,especiallythosewhicharefoundinthewallsoftheblood-vessels,andtheuseofwhichis,
bycontracting,todiminishthelatter'scalibre.Thesemusclesandtheir 



nerves, 
forming 
together 
the 
'vaso-motor 
apparatus,' 
act 
in 
grief 
contrarilytothevoluntarymotorapparatus.Insteadofbeingparalyzed, 
like 
the 
latter, 
the 
vascular 
muscles 
are 
more 
strongly 
contracted 
than 
usual, 
so 
that 
the 
tissues 
and 
organs 
of 
the 
body 
become 
anæmic. 
The 
immediate 
consequence 
of 
this 
bloodlessness 
is 
pallor 
and 
shrunkenness, 
and 
the 
pale 
color 
and 
collapsed 
features 
are 
the 
peculiaritieswhich,inconnectionwiththerelaxationofthevisage,givetothevictimofgriefhischaracteristicphysiognomy,andoftengiveanimpressionofemaciationwhichensuestoorapidlytobepossiblyduetoreal

or

Anotherregularconsequenceofthebloodlessnessoftheskinisafeelingof 
cold, 
and 
shivering. 
A 
constant 
symptom 
of 
grief 
is 
sensitiveness 
to 
cold, 
and 
difficulty 
in 
keeping 
warm. 
In

Lange

on 
to 
suggest 
that 
this 
may 
be 
a 
reaction 
from 
a 
previouslycontractedvaso-motorstate.Theexplanationseemsaforced 
one. 
The 
fact 
is 
that 
there 
are 
changeable 
expressions 
of 
grief. 
The 
weeping 
is 
as 
apt 
as 
not 
to 
be 
immediate, 
especially 
in 
women 
and 
children. 
Some 
men 
can 
never

The

that

reverently 
to

their

and

But 
if 
we 
regard 
them 
as 
products 
of 
more 
general 
causes 
(as

the

Prof. 
C. 
Lange, 
of

in 
the

from 
which 
I 
have 
already

published 
in 
1885 
a

broached 
the 
previous 
year 
in 
an 
article 
in 
Mind. 
None 
of 
the 
criticisms 
which 
I 
have

Ournaturalwayofthinkingaboutthesecoarseremotionsisthatthemental 
perception 
of 
some 
fact 
excites 
the 
mental 
affection 
called 
the 
emotion, 
and 
that 
this 
latter 
state 
of 
mind 
gives 
rise 
to 
the 
bodily 
expression.Mytheory,onthecontrary,isthatthebodilychangesfollow 
directly 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
exciting 
fact, 
and 
that

weareinsultedbyarival,areangryandstrike.Thehypothesisheretobedefended 
says 
that 
this 
order 
of 
sequence 
is 
incorrect, 
that 
the 
one 
mental 
state 
is 
not 
immediately 
induced 
by 
the 
other, 
that 
the 
bodily 
manifestations 
must 
first 
be 
interposed 
between, 
and 
that 
the 
more 
rationalstatementisthatwefeelsorrybecausewecry, 
angrybecause 
we 
strike, 
afraid 
because 
we 
tremble, 
and 
not 
that 
we 
cry, 
strike, 
or 
tremble, 
because 
we 
are 
sorry, 
angry, 
or 
fearful, 
as 
the 
case 
may 
be.
Withoutthebodilystatesfollowingontheperception,thelatterwouldbe

And 
yet 
neither 
many 
nor

considerations 
are 
required 
to 
mitigate 
its 
paradoxical 
character, 
and 
possiblytoproduceconvictionofitstruth. 


Tobeginwith,noreaderofthelasttwochapterswillbeinclinedtodoubt 
the 
fact 
that 
objects 
do 
excite 
bodily 
changes 
by 
a 
preorganized

or 
the 
farther 
fact 
that

The 
next 
thing 
to 
be

is 
this,

Our 
whole 
cubic 
capacity 
is 
sensibly 
alive; 
and 
each 
morsel 
of 
it 
contributes 
its 
pulsations 
of 
feeling, 
dim 
or 
sharp, 
pleasant, 
painful, 
or 
dubious, 
to 
that 
sense 
of 
personality 
that 
every 
one 
of 
us 
unfailingly 
carries 
with 
him. 
It 
is 
surprising 
what 
little 
items 
give 
accent 
to 
these 
complexesofsensibility. 
Whenworried

Our

here 
being 
with 
the 
general 
view 
rather 
than 
with 
the 
details, 
I 
will 
not

but 
I 
say 
that

us,

is 
inconceivable.

Letnotthis 
view 
becalledmaterialistic. 
It 
is 
neither 
morenorless 
materialistic 
than 
any 
other 
view 
which 
says 
that 
our 
emotions 
are 
conditioned 
by 
nervous 
processes. 
No 
reader 
of 
this 
book 
is 
likely 
torebelagainstsuchasayingsolongasitisexpressedingeneralterms;
and 
if 
any 
one 
still 
finds 
materialism 
in

thesis 
now 
defended, 
that

processes 
due 
to

happenings.Suchprocesseshave,itistrue,alwaysbeenregardedbythe 
platonizers 
in 
psychology 
as 
having 
something 
peculiarly 
base 
about 
them. 
But 
our 
emotions 
must 
always 
be 
inwardly 
what 
they 
are, 
whatever 
be 
the 
physiological 
ground 
of 
their 
apparition. 
If 
they 
are

pure, 
worthy, 
spiritual 
facts 
on 
any 
conceivable 
theory 
of 
their 
physiological 
source, 
they 
remain 
no 
less 
deep, 
pure,

worthy 
of

on 
this

Definite 
questions 
now 
immediatelyarise--questionsverydifferentfromthosewhichwerethe 
only 
possible 
ones 
without 
this 
view. 
Those 
were 
questions 
of 
classification: 
"Whicharethepropergeneraofemotion,andwhichthe 
species 
under 
each?" 
or 
of 
description: 
"By 
what 
expression 
is 
each 
emotion 
characterized?" 
The 
questions 
now 
are 
causal: 
Just 
what 
changesdoesthisobjectandwhatchangesdoesthatobjectexcite?"and 
"Howcometheytoexcitetheseparticularchangesandnotothers?"We 
step 
from 
a 
superficial 
to 
a 
deep 
order 
of 
inquiry. 
Classification 
and 
description 
are 
the 
lowest 
stage 
of 
science. 
They 
sink

We

as

absolutely 
no

Such

who,

appears 
to 
bystanders 
to 
be

but 
who 
afterwards 
confesses 
that 
he

no

an

One

He 
anticipates 
certain

and 
the

precipitates

In 
cases 
of 
morbid 
terror 
the 
subjects 
often 
confess 
that 
what 
possesses 
them 
seems, 
more 
than 
anything, 
to 
be 
fear 
of 
the 
fear 
itself. 
In 
the 
various 
forms 
of 
what 
Professor 
Pain 
calls 
'tender 
emotion,'

the 
appropriate

usually 
be

In 
sentimental 
natures 
the 
thought 
of 
'yearning' 
will 
produce 
real 
'yearning.' 
And,

that, 
on

Third 
Objection. 
Manifesting 
an 
emotion, 
so 
far 
from 
increasing 
it, 
makes 
it 
cease. 
Rage 
evaporates 
after 
a 
good 
outburst; 
it 
is 
pent-up 
emotionsthat"worklikemadnessinthebrain."

Concordsof 
sounds, 
of 
colors, 
of 
lines, 
logical 
consistencies, 
teleological 
fitnesses, 
affect 
us 
with 
a 
pleasure 
that 
seems 
ingrained 
in 
the 
very 
form 
of 
the 
representation 
itself, 
and 
to 
borrow 
nothing 
from 
any

Wehave,then,or 
some 
of 
us 
seem 
to 
have, 
genuinely 
cerebral 
forms 
of

and

apparently

with 
the

In

to

we 
must 
immediately 
insist 
that 
æsthetic 
emotion,
pureandsimple,thepleasuregivenusbycertainlinesandmasses,andcombinations

The 
more 
classic 
one's

is, 
however, 
the 
less 
relatively 
important 
are 
the 
secondary 
pleasures 
felt 
to 
be 
in 
comparison 
with 
those 
of 
the 
primary

as 
it

in.22

The

brands 
these

prefers 
the

These

IftheneuralprocessunderlyingemotionalconsciousnessbewhatIhave 
now 
sought 
to 
prove 
it, 
the 
physiology 
of 
the 
brain 
becomes 
a 
simpler 
matter 
than 
has 
been 
hitherto 
supposed. 
Sensational, 
associational, 
and 
motor 
elements 
are 
all 
that 
the 
organ 
need 
contain. 
The 
physiologists 
who, 
during 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
have 
been 
so 
industriously 
exploring 
the 
brain's 
functions, 
have 
limited 
their 
explanations 
to 
its 
cognitive 
and 
volitional 
performances. 
Dividing

And 
yet 
it

EmotionalDifferencesBetweenIndividuals. 


The 
revivability 
in 
memory 
of 
the 
emotions, 
like 
that 
of 
all 
the 
feelings 
of 
the 
lower 
senses, 
is 
very 
small. 
We 
can 
remember 
that 
we 
underwent 
grief 
or 
rapture, 
but 
not 
just 
how 
the 
grief 
or 
rapture 
felt. 
This

Thisisperhapsareasonwhyit 
may 
be 
better 
that 
a 
man 
of 
thought 
should 
not 
have 
too 
strong 
a

power. 
He 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
have 
his 
trains 
of 
meditation 
disturbed 
by 
emotional 
interruptions. 
It 
will 
be 
remembered 
that 
Mr.

One 
final 
generality 
about 
the 
emotions 
remains 
to 
be 
noted: 
They 
blunt 
themselves 
by 
repetition 
more 
rapidly 
than 
any 
other 
sort 
of 
feeling. 
This 
is 
due 
not 
only 
to 
the 
general 
law 
of 
'accommodation' 
to 
theirstimuluswhichwesawtoobtainofallfeelingswhatever,buttothepeculiar 
fact 
that 
the 
'diffusive 
wave' 
of 
reflex 
effects 
tends 
always 
to 



become 
more 
narrow. 
It 
seems 
as 
if 
it 
were 
essentially 
meant 
to 
be 
a 
provisionalarrangement,onthebasisofwhichpreciseanddeterminatereactionsmightarise. 
Themoreweexerciseourselvesatanything, 
the

to 
which 
it 
gives 
rise. 
The 
first 
time 
we 
saw 
it 
we 
could 
perhaps 
neither 
act 
nor 
think 
at 
all, 
and 
had 
no 
reaction 
but 
organic 
perturbation. 
The 
emotions 
of 
startled 
surprise, 
wonder, 
or 
curiosity 
were 
the 
result. 
Now 
we 
look 
on 
with 
absolutely 
no 
emotion.24

This

The 
trains 
of 
intellectual 
association, 
the 
memories, 
the 
logical 
relations, 
may, 
however, 
be 
voluminous 
in 
the 
extreme. 
Past

question 
1. 
As 
is 
but 
natural, 
the 
effects 
upon 
the 
face 
have 
received 
the 
most 
careful 
attention. 
The

Asregardsquestion2,somelittleprogresshasofrecentyearsbeenmadeinansweringit.Twothingsarecertain: 


a. 
The 
facial 
muscles 
of 
expression 
are 
not 
given 
us 
simply 
for 
expression'ssake;27 
b. 
Each 
muscle 
is 
not 
affected 
to 
some 
one 
emotion 
exclusively, 
as 
certain 
writers 
have 
thought. 
Some 
movements 
of 
expression 
can 
be 
accounted 
for 
as 
weakened 
repetitions 
of 
movements 
which 
formerly 
(when 
they 
were 
stronger) 
were 
of 
utility 
to 
the 
subject. 
Others 
are 
similarly 
weakened 
repetitions 
of 
movements 
which 
under 
other 
conditionswerephysiologicallynecessaryeffects.Ofthelatterreactions 
the 
respiratory 
disturbances 
in 
anger 
and 
fear 
might 
be 
taken 
as 
examples 
--organic 
reminiscences, 
as 
it 
were, 
reverberations 
in 
imagination 
of 
the 
blowings 
of 
the 
man 
making 
a 
series 
of 
combative 
efforts, 
of 
the 
pantings 
of 
one 
in 
precipitate 
flight. 
Such 
at

is 
a 
suggestionmadebyMr.Spencerwhichhasfoundapproval.Andhealso

"To

he 
says,

To

About 
fear 
I 
shall 
have 
more 
to 
say 
presently. 
Meanwhile 
the 
principleofrevivalinweakenedformofreactionsusefulinmoreviolentdealings 
with 
the 
object 
inspiring 
the 
emotion, 
has 
found 
many 
applications. 
So 
slight 
a 
symptom 
as 
the 
snarl 
or 
sneer, 
the 
one-sided 
uncoveringoftheupperteeth,isaccountedforbyDarwinasasurvivalfromthetimewhenourancestorshadlargecanines,andunfleshedthem(as 
dogs 
now 
do) 
for 
attack. 
Similarly 
the 
raising 
of 
the 
eyebrows 
in 
outward 
attention, 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
mouth 
in 
astonishment, 
come, 
according 
to 
the 
same 
author, 
from 
the 
utility 
of 
these 
movements 
in 
extremecases.Theraisingoftheeyebrowsgoeswiththeopeningofthe

for

vision; 
the 
opening 
of 
the

with 
the

listening, 
and 
with 
the 
rapid 
catching 
of 
the 
breath 
which 
precedes 
musculareffort.Thedistentionofthenostrilsinangerisinterpretedby 
Spencer 
as 
an 
echo 
of 
the 
way 
in 
which 
our 
ancestors 
had 
to 
breathe 
when, 
during 
combat, 
their 
"mouth 
was 
filled 
up 
by 
a 
part 
of 
an 



antagonist's 
body 
that 
had 
been 
seized(!)." 
The 
trembling 
of 
fear 
is 
supposedbyMantegazzatobeforthesakeofwarmingtheblood(!).The 
reddening 
of 
the 
face 
and 
neck 
is 
called 
by 
Wundt 
a 
compensatory 
arrangement 
for 
relieving 
the 
brain 
of 
the 
blood-pressure 
which 
the 
simultaneousexcitementoftheheartbringswithit.Theeffusionoftears 
is 
explained 
both 
by 
this 
author 
and 
by 
Darwin 
to 
be 
a 
blood-
withdrawing 
agency 
of 
a 
similar 
sort. 
The 
contraction 
of 
the 
muscles 
around 
the 
eyes, 
of 
which 
the 
primitive 
use 
is 
to 
protect 
those 
organs 
from 
being 
too 
much 
gorged 
with 
blood 
during 
the 
screaming 
fits 
of 
infancy,survivesinadultlifeintheshapeofthefrown,whichinstantly 
comes 
over 
the 
brow 
when 
anything

or 
displeasing

"Asthehabitofcontractingthebrowshasbeenfollowedbyinfantsduringinnumerablegenerations,atthecommencementofeverycryingorscreamingfit,"saysDarwin,"ithasbecomefirmlyassociatedwiththe

Thebloodpressure 
has 
to 
be 
high 
during 
the 
sexual

hence 
the

Another 
principle, 
to 
which 
Darwin 
perhaps 
hardly 
does 
sufficient 
justice, 
may 
be 
called 
the 
principle 
of 
reacting 
similarly 
to 
analogous



feeling 
stimuli. 
There 
is 
a 
whole 
vocabulary 
of 
descriptive 
adjectives 
common 
to 
impressions 
belonging 
to 
different 
sensible 
spheres 
-experiences 
off 
all 
classes 
are 
sweet, 
impressions 
of 
all 
classes 
rich 
or 
solid, 
sensations 
of 
all 
classes 
sharp. 
Wundt 
and 
Piderit 
accordingly 
explain 
many 
of 
our 
most 
expressive 
reactions 
upon 
moral 
causes 
as 
symbolicgustatorymovements.Assoonasanyexperienceariseswhich 
has 
an 
affinity 
with 
the 
feeling 
of 
sweet, 
or 
bitter, 
or 
sour, 
the 
same 
movementsareexecutedwhichwouldresultfromthetasteinpoint.31"All 
the 
states 
of 
mind 
which 
language 
designates 
by 
the 
metaphors 
bitter, 
harsh, 
sweet, 
combine 
themselves, 
therefore, 
with 
the 
corresponding 
mimetic 
movements 
of 
the 
mouth." 
Certainly 
the 
emotions 
of 
disgust 
and 
satisfaction 
do 
express 
themselves 
in 
this 
mimeticway.Disgustisanincipientregurgitationorretching,limitingitsexpression

ProfessorBain,ifImistakenot,hadlongpreviouslycommenteduponfearinasimilarway. 


Mr. 
Darwin 
accounts 
for 
many 
emotional 
expressions 
by 
what 
he 
calls 
the 
principle 
of 
antithesis. 
In 
virtue 
of 
this

thatDarwinexplainstheexpressionofimpotence,raisedeyebrows,andshrugged

on

subject. 


To 
sum 
up, 
we 
see 
the 
reason 
for 
a 
few 
emotional 
reactions; 
forothersapossiblespeciesofreasonmaybeguessed;butothersremainfor

it 
is 
againplain 
that

would 
really 
be

the 
power 
of 
expressing

Will. 


Desire,

of

The 
mechanism 
of 
production 
of 
these 
voluntary 
movements 
is 
what 
befalls 
us 
to

now.

This 
is 
the 
first 
point 
to 
understand 
in 
the 
psychology 
of 
Volition. 
Reflex, 
instinctive, 
and 
emotional 
movements 
are 
all 
primary 
performances. 
The 
nerve-centres 
are 
so 
organized 
that 
certain 
stimuli 
pullthetriggerofcertainexplosiveparts;andacreaturegoingthrough 
one 
of 
these

for 
the

undergoes 
an 
entirely 
novel 
experience.TheotherdayIwasstandingatarailroadstationwithalittlechild,

The

Butif,involuntaryactionproperlyso-called,theactmustbeforeseen,itfollows 
that 
no 
creature 
not 
endowed 
with 
divinatory 
power 
can 
perform 
an 
act 
voluntarily 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
Well, 
we 
are 
no 
more 
endowed 
with 
prophetic

of

Now 
the 
same 
movement 
involuntarily 
performed 
may 
leave 
many 
differentkindsofideasofitselfinthememory.Ifperformedbyanother

we 
of

Butinadditiontotheseimpressionsuponremoteorgansofsense,wehave, 
whenever 
we 
perform 
a 
movement 
ourselves, 
another 
set 
of 
impressions, 
those, 
namely, 
which 
come 
up 
from 
the 
parts 
that 
are 
actuallymoved.Thesekinoestheticimpressions,asDr.Bastianhascalled 
them, 
are 
so 
many 
resident 
effects 
of 
the 
motion. 
Not 
only 
are 
our 
musclessuppliedwithafferentaswellaswithefferentnerves, 
butthe 
tendons, 
the 
ligaments, 
the 
articular 
surfaces, 
and 
the 
skin 
about 
the 
joints 
are 
all 
sensitive, 
and, 
being 
stretched 
and 
squeezed 
in 
wayscharacteristicofeachparticularmovement,giveusasmanydistinctivefeelingsastherearemovementspossibletoperform. 


It 
is 
by 
these 
resident 
impressions 
that 
we 
are 
made 
conscious 
of 
passivemovements-movementscommunicatedtoourlimbsbyothers.

"The

Then 
after 
some 
oscillations 
the

gradually 
sank 
by 
reason 
of 
its 
weight 
(the

A 
similar 
condition 
can 
be 
readily 
reproduced 
experimentally 
in 
many 
hypnotic 
subjects. 
All 
that 
is 
needed 
is 
to 
tell 
a

predisposed 
person 
during 
the 
hypnotic 
trance 
that 
he 
cannot 
feel

All 
these 
cases, 
whether 
spontaneous

show 
the

we 
shallseethatbyvirtueofthisprincipleofparsimonyinconsciousnessthe

and

For 
a

to 
be 
produced 
with 
perfect

it 
sufficesthatitobeyinstantlyitsownmentalcueandnothingelse,and 



that 
this 
mental

be 
incapable 
of 
awakening 
any 
other

Now 
the 
simplest 
possible 
arrangement 
for 
producing 
voluntary 
movements 
would 
be 
that 
the 
memory-images

The

however, 
say 
that

Now 
the

may 
still 
shake

"But

to

Even 
so! 
I 
reply 
to 
both 
queries. 
We 
have 
a 
most 
extremely 
delicate 
foreshadowing 
of 
the

Quicker

delicatelygraduatedwhenourwillsarepassive,andourlimbsmadetocontractbydirectlocalfaradization,aswhenweourselvesinnervatethem.Ferrier16has

the

They

at 
the

least 
they 
tend 
to 
show 
that 
no

accruetoourperceptionfromtheconsciousnessoftheefferentprocess,
evenifitexisted. 


Since 
there 
is 
no 
direct 
introspective 
evidence 
for 
the 
feelings 
of 
innervation, 
is 
there 
any 
indirect

But 
Dr.

in 
his 
Functions

(Am.

222-4) 
disposesveryeasilyofthislineofargument.Hesays: 


"It 
is 
necessary, 
however, 
to 
exclude

altogether 
before 
such 
an

[as 
Wundt's] 
can 
be 
adopted. 
Now, 
though 
the 
hemiplegic 
patient 
cannot 
move 
his 
paralyzed 
limb, 
though 
he 
is 



conscious

he

to

and 
I 
have 
repeatedly 
verified 
it, 
that 
when 
a 
hemiplegic 
patient 
is 
desired 
to 
close 
his 
paralyzed 
fist, 
in 
his 
endeavors 
to 
do 
so 
he 
unconsciously

of

exist 
without 
our 
being 
obliged 
to 
regard 
it 
as 
depending 
on

"Itis,however,easytomakeanexperimentofasimplenaturewhichwill

they 
prove 
conclusively 
that 
the 
consciousness

exertion, 
being 
impossible 
without 
movement 
effected 
somewhere, 
must 
be 
an

Partial 
paralysis 
of 
the 
same 
muscle, 
paresis, 
as 
it 
has 
been 
called, 
seems 
to 
point 
even 
more 
conclusively 
to 
the 
same 
inference, 
that 
the 
will 
to 
innervate 
is 
felt 
independently 
of 
all 
its 
afferent 
results. 
I 
will 
quote 
the 
account 
given 
by 
a 
recent 
authority,22 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
this 
accident: 


"Whenthenervegoingtoaneyemuscle,e.g.,theexternalrectusof

that 
the

volitional

which 
under

have 
perhaps

Take 
first 
the 
case 
of 
complete 
paralysis 
and 
assume 
the 
right 
eye 
affected. 
Suppose 
the 
patient 
desires 
to 
rotate 
his 
gaze 
to 
an 
object 
situated 
in 
the 
extreme 
right 
of 
the 
field 
of 
vision.

Of 
course 
this 
continued 
and 
extreme 
rotation 
producesafferentfeelingsofrightwardmotionintheeyeball,whichmomentarily 
overpower 
the 
faint

us

turn 
to 
the 
case 
of

paresis 
with 
apparent 
translocationofthefield. 


Heretherighteyesucceedsinfixatingtheobject,butobservationof 
the 
left 
eye 
will 
reveal 
to 
an 
observer 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
squints 
just 
as 
violentlyinwardsasintheformercase.Thedirectionwhichthefingerof 
the 
patient 
takes 
in 
pointing 
to 
the

is 
the

and 
the 
line 
of

Thetranslocationwould,inaword,beperfectlyexplainedcouldwe 
suppose 
that 
the 
sensation 
of 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
rotation 
in 
the 
left 
eyeball 
were 
able 
to 
suggest 
to 
the

the

It

long 
practice 
directed 
specially 
ad 
hoc 
to 
teach 
us 
on 
which 
retina 
the 
sensations 
severally 
fall. 
Similarly 
the 
different 
sensations 
which 
arise 
from 
the

of

are 
used

Another 
piece 
of 
circumstantial 
evidence 
for 
the 
feelings 
of 
innervationisthatadducedbyProfessorMach,asfollows: 


"Ifwestandonabridge,andlookatthewaterflowingbeneath,weusually 
feel 
ourselves 
at 
rest, 
whilst 
the 
water 
seems 
in 
motion. 
Prolongedlookingatthewater,however,commonlyhasforitsresulttomakethebridgewiththeobserverandsurroundingssuddenlyseemtomoveinthedirectionopposedtothatofthewater,whilstthewateritself 
assumes 
the 
appearance 
of 
standing 
still. 
The 
relative 
motion 
of 
the 
objectsisinbothcasesthesame,andtheremustthereforebesome 


adequate 
physiological 
ground 
why 
sometimes 
one, 
sometimes 
the 
other 
part 
of 
them 
is 
felt 
to 
move. 
In 
order 
to 
investigate 
the 
matter 
conveniently, 
I 
had 
the 
simple 
apparatus 
constructed 
which 
is 
representedinFig.86.Anoil-clothwithasimplepatternishorizontallystretchedovertwocylinders(each2metreslongand3feetapart)andkeptinuniformmotionbythehelpofacrankAcrossthecloth,andsome30 
cm. 
above 
it, 
is 
stretched 
a 
string, 
with 
a 
knot

which 
serves 
as 
a 
fixation-pointfortheeyeoftheobserver.Iftheobserverfollowwithhis 
eyesthepatternoftheclothasitmoves,heseesitinmovement,himselfandthesurroundingsatrest.Butifhelooksattheknot,hesoonfeelsas

whilstthelatterseemstostandstill.Thischangeinthemodeoflooking 
comes 
about 
in 
more 
or 
less 
time 
according 
to 
one's 
momentary 
disposition, 
but 
usually 
it 
takes 
but 
a 
few 
seconds. 
If 
one 
once 
understandsthepoint, 
onecanmakethetwoappearancesalternateat 
will. 
Every 
following 
of 
the 
oil-cloth 
makes 
the 
observer 
stationary; 
every 
fixation 
of 
the 
knot 
or 
inattention 
to 
the 
oil-cloth, 
so 
that 
its 



patternbecomesblurred,setshiminapparentmotion."25 
ProfessorMachproceedstoexplainthephenomenonasfollows: 


"Movingobjectsexert,asiswellknown,apeculiarmotorstimulationupontheeye,theydrawourattentionandourlookafterthem.Ifthelookreallyfollowsthem...weassumethattheymove.Butiftheeye,instead

apparatus. 
Butthisisjustwhatwouldhappenifthesteadfastlyfixatedpointwereitselfmovinguniformlyintheotherdirection,andwewerefollowingitwithoureyes.Whenthiscomesabout,whatevermotionlessthingsarelookedatmustappearinmotion."26 


The 
knot

the 
string, 
we 
ourselves, 
and 
all 
our 
stationarysurroundingsthusappearinmovement,accordingtoMach,becauseweareconstantlyinnervatingoureyeballstoresistthedragexerteduponthem

or

I 
have 
myself 
repeated 
the 
observation 
many 
times 
above 
flowing 
streams, 
but 
have 
never 
succeededingettingthefullillusionasdescribedbyMach.Igainasenseofthemovementofthebridgeandofmyownbody,buttherivernever

to 
stop: 
it 
still 
moves 
in 
one 
direction, 
whilst 
I 
float 
away 
in 
the 
other. 
But, 
be 
the 
illusion 
partial 
or 
complete, 
a 
different 
explanation 
of 
it 
from 
Professor 
Mach's 
seems 
to 
me 
the 
more 
natural 
onetoadopt.Theillusionissaidtoceasewhen,ourattentionbeingfullyfixedonthemovingoil-cloth,weperceivethelatterforwhatitis;andto 
recommence, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
when 
we 
perceive 
the 
oil-cloth 
as 
a 
vaguely 
moving 
background 
behind 
an 
object 
which 
we 
directly 
fixate 
and 
whose 
position 
with 
regard 
to 
our 
own

is 
unchanged. 
This,
however,isthesortofconsciousnesswhichwehavewheneverweareourselvesborneinavehicle,onhorseback,orinaboat.Asweandour

thewholebackgroundgoestheother. 
Ishould 
rather, 
therefore, 
explain 
Professor 
Mach's 
illusion 
as 
similar 
to 
the 
illusionatrailroad-stationsdescribedaboveonpage90.Theothertrain

of 
the

and 
the

through 
which 
it 
shines, 
by 
similarly 
altering 
the 
attention. 
Such 
alterations,however,inourconceptionofwhichpartofthevisualfieldissubstantive 
object 
and 
which 
part

seem 
to 
have 
no 
connection 
with 
feelings 
of

I 
cannot, 
therefore, 
regard 
theobservationofProf.Machasanyproofthatthelatterfeelingsexist.27

A 
patient 
examined 
by 
Messrs. 
Gley 
and 
Marillier 
beautifully 
showed 
this. 
His 
entire 
arms, 
and 
his 
trunk 
down 
to 
the 
navel, 
were 
insensible 
both 
superficially 
and 
deeply, 
but 
his 
arms 
were 
not 
paralyzed:

to 
me, 
the 
true 
line 
between 
the 
passive

and 
the

of

be

It 
is 
certainly 
false

todraw 
itbetween

If

at 
the

of

"Of

that

we

We

it

that

is 
required. 
Butthatthereisnoexpressfiatneededwhentheconditions

simple, 
the 
reader 
ought 
now 
to 
be 
convinced. 
Lest, 
however, 
he 
should 
still 
share 
the 
common 
prejudice 
that 
voluntary 
action 
without 
'exertion 
of 
will-power' 
is 
Hamlet 
with 
the 
prince's 
part 
left 
out, 
I 
will 
make 
a 
few 
farther 
remarks. 
The 
first 
point 
to 
start 
from 
in 
understanding 
voluntary 
action, 
and 
the 
possible 
occurrence 
of 
it 
with 
no 
fiat 
or 
express 
resolve, 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
consciousness 
is 
in 
its 
verynatureimpulsive.39Wedonothaveasensationorathoughtandthenhavetoaddsomethingdynamictoittogetamovement.Everypulseof 
feeling 
which 
we 
have 
is 
the 
correlate 
of 
some 
neural 
activity 
that 
is 
alreadyonitswaytoinstigateamovement.Oursensationsandthoughts 
are 
but 
cross-sections, 
as 
it 
were, 
of 
currents 
whose 
essential 
consequenceismotion, 
and 
which 
nosooner 
run 
in 
at 
onenerve 
than 
they 
run 
out 
again 
at 
another. 
The 
popular 
notion 
that 
mere 
consciousnessassuchisnotessentiallyaforerunnerofactivity,thatthelatter 
must 
result 
from 
some 
superadded 
'will-force,' 
is 
a 
very 
natural 
inference 
from 
those 
special 
cases 
in 
which 
we 
think 
of 
an 
act 
for 
an 
indefinite 
length 
of 
time 
without 
the 
action 
taking 
place. 
These 
cases,
however,arenotthenorm;theyarecasesofinhibitionbyantagonisticthoughts. 
Whentheblockingisreleasedwefeelasifaninwardspringwereletloose,andthisistheadditionalimpulseorfiatuponwhichtheacteffectivelysucceeds.Weshallstudyanontheblockinganditsrelease.
Ourhigherthoughtisfullofit. 
Butwherethereisnoblocking,thereis 
naturally 
no 
hiatus 
between 
the 
thought-process 
and 
the 
motor 
discharge. 
Movement 
is 
the 
natural 
immediate 
effect 
of 
feeling, 
irrespectiveof 
whatthequalityofthe 
feeling 
maybe. 
Itisso 
in

action 
is 
thus 
no 
paradox, 
to 
be 
softened 
or 
explained 
away. 
It 
obeys 
the 
type 
of 
all 
conscious 
action, 
and 
from 
it 
one 
must 
start 
to 
explainactioninwhichaspecialfiatisinvolved. 


Itmayberemarkedinpassing,thattheinhibitionofamovementno

relieve 
the

comes 
that

any

Against

the

FiveTypesofDecision. 


Turning 
now 
to 
the 
form 
of 
the 
decision 
itself, 
we 
may 
distinguish 
fourchieftypes.Thefirstmaybecalledthereasonabletype.Itisthatof

We 
have, 
however, 
a

to 
act 
unhesitatingly 
in 
a 
certain 
stereotyped 
way. 
It 
may 
be 
said 
in 
general 
that 
a 
great 
part 
of 
every 
deliberation 
consists 
in 
the 
turning 
over 
of 
all 
the 
possible

two 
types 
of

the 
final

occurs 
before

Under 
these 
conditions 
it 
will 
often 
happen 
that 
some 
accidental 
circumstance, 
supervening 
at 
a 
particular 
movement 
upon 
our 
mental 
weariness, 
will 
upset 
the 
balance 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
one 
of 
the 
alternatives, 
to 
which 
then 
we 
feel 
ourselves 
committed, 
although 
an 
opposite 
accident 
at 
the 
same 
time 
might 
have 
produced 
the 
opposite 
result. 


In 
the 
second 
type 
of 
case 
our 
feeling 
is 
to 
a 
certain 
extent 
that 
of 
letting 
ourselves 
drift 
with 
a 
certain 
indifferent 
acquiescence 
in 
a 
directionaccidentallydeterminedfromwithout,withtheconvictionthat,
afterall,wemightaswellstandbythiscourseasbytheother,andthatthingsareinanyeventsuretoturnoutsufficientlyright. 


Inthethirdtypethedeterminationseemsequallyaccidental, 
butit 
comes 
from 
within, 
and 
not 
from 
without. 
If 
often 
happens, 
when 
the 
absenceofimperativeprincipleisperplexingandsuspensedistracting,
that 
we 
find 
ourselves 
acting, 
as 
it 
were, 
automatically, 
and 
as 
if 
by 
a 
spontaneousdischargeofournerves,inthedirectionofoneofthehornsof 
the 
dilemma. 
But 
so 
exciting 
is 
this 
sense 
of 
motion 
after 
our 
intolerable 
pent-up 
state, 
that 
we 
eagerly 
throw 
ourselves 
into 
it. 
'Forwardnow!'weinwardlycry,'thoughtheheavensfall.'Thisreckless

rather 
like 
passive 
spectators 
cheering 
on 
the 
display 
of 
some 
extraneous 
force 
than 
like 
voluntary 
agents, 
is 
a 
type 
of 
decision 
too 
abrupt 
and 
tumultuous 
to 
occur 
often 
in 
humdrum 
and 
cool-blooded 
natures. 
But 
it 
is 
probably 
frequent 
in 
persons 
of 
strong 
emotional 
endowment 
and 
unstable 
or 
vacillating 
character. 
And 
in 
men 
of 
the 
world-shaking 
type, 
the 
Napoleons, 
Luthers, 
etc., 
in 
whom 
tenacious 
passion 
combines 
with 
ebullient 
activity, 
when 
by 
any

outlet 
has 
been

or 
apprehensions,

Thefloodbreaks 
quite 
unexpectedly 
through 
the

That 
is 
should 
so 
often 
do 
so 
is 
quite 
sufficient 
to 
account 
for 
the 
tendency 
of 
these

its 
chief 
difference 
from 
the

cases 
appears 
to 
be 
that 
in 
those 
cases 
the 
mind 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
deciding 
on 
the 
triumphant 
alternative 
dropped 
the

wholly 
or 
nearly

very 
act 
of

vanquished 
possibility 
the 
chooser 
realizes 
how 
much 
in 
that 
instant 
he 
is 
making 
himself 
lose. 
It 
is 
deliberately 
driving 
a 
thorn 
into

an 
altogether 
peculiar 
sort 
of 
mental 
phenomenon. 
The 
immense 
majority 
of 
human 
decisions 
are 
decisions 
without 
effort. 
In 
comparitively 
few 
of 
them, 
in 
most 
people, 
does 
effort 
accompany 
the 
final 
act. 
We 
are, 
I 
think, 
misled 
into

that

frequentthanitis,bythefactthatduringdeliberationwesooftenhaveafeelingofhowgreataneffortitwouldtaketomakeadecisionnow.Later,

It

There 
is 
a 
certain 
normal 
ratio 
in 
the 
impulsive 
power 
of 
different 
sorts 
of

which

with

Healthiness 
of 
will 
moreover 
requires 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
complication 
in 
the 
process 
which 
precedes 
the 
fiat 
or 
the 
act. 
Each 
stimulusoridea,atthesametimethatitwakensitsownimpulse,mustarouseother 
ideas(associated 
andconsequential)with 
their 
impulses, 
and 
action 
must 
follow, 
neither 
too 
slowly 
nor 
too 
rapidly, 
as

And 
where 
the 
will 
is 
healthy,thevisionmustberight(i.e.,themotivesmustbeonthewholein 
a 
normal 
or 
not 
too 
unusual 
ratio 
to

and 
the 
action 
must 
obeythevision'slead. 


Unhealthinessofwillmaythuscomeaboutinmanyways.Theaction 
may 
follow 
the 
stimulus 
or 
idea 
too 
rapidly, 
leaving 
no 
time 
for 
the 
arousal 
of 
restraining 
associates 
-we 
then 
have 
a 
precipitate 
will. 
Or, 
although 
the 
associates 
may 
come, 
the

If

theyfallintotwogroups,inoneofwhichnormalactionsareimpossible,

One 
may

readily 
by 
losing 
the 
usual

as 
by 
getting

more

of

Who

of

The

The

example 
of 
this 
is 
where 
an 
imbecile 
or 
dement, 
seeing 
something 
glittering, 
appropriates 
it 
to

Now 
our

of 
conceiving

under

is 
as 
an 
active

adding

temporary 
resistance. 
He 
speaks 
of

But 
the

so

If

TheoriesAbouttheHypnoticState. 


The 
intimate 
nature 
of 
the 
hypnotic 
condition, 
when 
once 
induced, 
can 
hardly 
be 
said 
to 
be 
understood. 
Without 
entering 
into 
details 
of 
controversy, 
one 
may 
say 
that 
three 
main 
opinions 
have 
been 
held 
concerningit,whichwemaycallrespectivelythetheoriesof 


1.Animalmagnetism; 


2.ofNeurosis;andfinallyof 


3.Suggestion. 


Accordingtotheanimal-magnetismtheorythereisadirectpassageofforcefromtheoperatortothesubject,wherebythelatterbecomestheformer's

This 
theory 
is 
nowadays 
given 
up 
as 
regards 
all 
the 
ordinaryhypnoticphenomena,andisonlyheldtobysomepersonsasanexplanationofafeweffectsexceptionallymetwith. 


According 
to 
the 
neurosis-theory, 
the 
hypnotic 
state 
is 
a 
peculiarpathologicalconditionintowhichcertainpre-disposedpatientsfall,andin 
which 
special 
physical 
agents 
have 
the 
power 
of 
provoking 
special 
symptoms, 
quite 
apart 
from 
the 
subjects 
mentally 
expecting 
the 
effect. 
Professor 
Charcot 
and 
his 
colleagues 
at 
the 
Salpétrière 
hospital 
admit 
that 
this 
condition 
is 
rarely 
found 
in 
typical 
form. 
They 
call 
it 
then 
le 
grand 
hypnotisme, 
and 
say 
that 
it 
accompanies 
the 
disease 
hysteroepilepsy.

be 
forcibly 
closed, 
the 
cataleptic 
gives 
place 
to 
the 
lethargic 
condition, 
characterized 
by 
apparent 
abolition 
of 
consciousness, 
and 
absolute 
muscular 
relaxation 
except 
where 
the 
muscles 
are 
kneaded 
or 
the 
tendons 
struck 
by 
the 
operator's 
hand, 
or 
certain 
nerve-trunks

upon. 
Then

Charcot

name 
of 
neuro-muscular 
hyperexcitability. 
The 
lethargic 
state 
may 
be 
primarily 
brought 
on 
by 
fixedly 
looking 
at 
anything, 
or 
by 
pressure 
on 
the 
closed 
eyeballs.

In 
this 
state 
the 
accurately 
limited 
muscular 
contractions 
characteristic 
of 
lethargy 
do 
not 
follow 
upon 
the 
above-described 
manipulations, 
but 
instead 
of 
them 
there 
is 
a 
tendency 
to 
rigidity 
of 
entire 
regions 
of 
the 
body, 
which 
may 
upon

develop 
into

M. 
Charcot

this

the

Many 
other 
symptoms, 
supposed 
by 
their 
observers 
to 
be 
independent 
of 
mental 
expectation, 
are 
described,

All 
the

seem 
to 
prove 
that, 
until

The 
first 
stages 
of 
ordinary 
sleep 
are 
characterized 
by 
a 
peculiar 
dispersed 
attitude 
of 
the 
attention. 
Images 
come 
before 
consciousness 
whichareentirelyincongruouswithourordinarybeliefsandhabitsofthought. 
The 
latter 
either 
vanish 
altogether 
or 
withdraw, 
as 
it 
were,
inertlyintothebackgroundofthemind,andlettheincongruousimagesreign 
alone. 
These 
images 
acquire, 
more-over, 
an 
exceptional 
vivacity; 
they 
become 
first 
'hypnagogic 
hallucinations,' 
and 
then, 
as 
the 
sleep 
grows 
deeper, 
dreams. 
Now 
the 
'mono-ideism,' 
or 
else 
the 
impotency 
and 
failure 
to 
'rally' 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
background-ideas, 
which 
thus 
characterize 
somnolescence, 
are 
unquestionably 
the 
result 
of 
a 
special 
physiological 
change 
occurring 
in 
the 
brain 
at 
that 
time. 
Just 
so 
that 
similar 
mono-ideism, 
or 
dissociation 
of 
the 
reigning 
fancy 
from 
those 
other 
thoughts 
which 
might 
possibly 
act 
as 
its 
'reductives,'

which

employ, 
tells

nothingofwhatthechangeis,butitmarksthefactthatitexists,andisconsequently 
a

The 
great 
vivacity 
of 
the 
hypnotic

(as

by 
their 
motor 
effects), 
the 
oblivion 
of

when

theabruptawakening, 
therecollectionofthem

the 
anæsthesia 
and

which 
are 
so 
frequent, 
all 
point 
away 
from 
our 
simple 
waking 
credulity 
and 
'suggestibility' 
as 
the 
type 
by 
which 
the 
phenomena 
are 
to 
be 
interpreted, 
and 
make 
us 
look 
rather 
towards 
sleep 
and 
dreaming, 
or 
towards 
those 
deeper 
alterations 
of 
the 
personality 
known 
as 
automatism, 
double 
consciousness, 
or 
'second' 
personality 
for 
the 
true 
analoguesofthehypnotictrance.3Eventhebesthypnoticsubjectspass

The 
symptoms 
earliest 
observed 
by 
writers 
were 
all 
thought 
to 
be 
typical. 
But 
with 
the 
multiplication 
of 
observed 
phenomena, 
the 
importance 
of 
most 
particular 
symptoms 
as 
marks 
of 
the 
state 
has 
diminished. 
This 
lightens 
very 
much 
our 
own 
immediate 
task. 
Proceeding 
to 
enumerate 
the 
symptoms 
of 
the 
hypnotic 
trance, 
I 
may 
confine 
myself 
to 
those 
which 
are 
intrinsically 
interesting,

which

certain 
number 
of 
patients 
even 
when 
the 
execution 
is 
named 
for 
a 
remote 
period 
--months 
or 
even 
a 
year, 
in 
one 
case 
reported 
by 
M. 
Liégeois. 
In 
this 
way 
one 
can 
make 
the 
patient 
feel 
a 
pain, 
or 
be 
paralyzed,orbehungryorthirsty,orhaveanhallucination,positiveornegative, 
or 
perform 
some 
fantastic 
action 
after 
emerging 
from

The 
effect 
in 
question 
may 
be 
ordered 
to 
take 
place 
not 
immediately, 
butafteranintervaloftimehaselapsed,andtheinterval 
may 
be 
left

the

or 
may 
be

a 
certain 
signal.Themomentthesignaloccurs,orthetimeisrunout,thesubject,

and 
by

may 
struggle 
with 
all 
the 
strength 
of 
his 
willagainsttheabsurdityofthisimpulsewhichhefeelsrisinginhim,heknows 
not

In 
these 
cases,

in

The 
only 
really 
mysterious 
feature 
of 
these 
deferred 
suggestions 
is 
the 
patient's 
absolute 
ignorance 
during 
the 
interval 
preceeding 
their 
execution 
that 
they 
have 
been 
deposited 
in 
his 
mind. 
They 
will 
often 
surgeupatthepreappointedtime,eventhoughyouhavevainlytriedawhilebeforetomakehimrecallthecircumstancesoftheirproduction.
The 
most 
important 
class 
of 
post-hypnotic 
suggestions 
are, 
of 
course, 
those 
relative 
to 
the 
patient's 
health 
--bowels, 
sleep, 
and 
other 
bodily 
functions. 
Among 
the 
most 
interesting 
(apart 
from 
the 
hallucinations) 
are 
those 
relative 
to 
future 
trances.

determine

still 
in

one 
can, 
by 
suggesting 
that 
certain 
personshallneverbeablehereaftertoputhimtosleep,removehimforallfuturetimefromhypnoticinfluenceswhichmightbedangerous.this, 
indeed, 
is 
the

and

use 
a

suggestions 
to 
protect 
himself 
against

Necessary 
Truths 
and 
the 
Effects 
of 
Experience. 


InthisfinalchapterIshalltreatofwhathassometimesbeencalledpsychogenesis,andtrytoascertainjusthowfartheconnectionsofthingsin 
the 
outward 
environment 
can 
account 
for 
our 
tendency 
to 
think 
of,
andtoreactupon,certainthingsincertainwaysandinnoothers,eventhoughpersonallywehavehadofthethingsinquestionnoexperience, 
or 
almost 
no 
experience, 
at 
all. 
It 
is 
a 
familiar 
truth 
that 
some 
propositionsarenecessary. 
Wemustattachthepredicate 
'equal'tothe 
subject 
'opposite 
sides 
of 
a 
parallelogram' 
if 
we 
think 
those 
terms 
togetheratall,whereasweneednotinanysuchwayattachthepredicate'rainy,' 
for 
example, 
to 
the 
subject 
'to-morrow.' 
The 
dubious 
sort 
of 
couplingoftermsisuniversallyadmittedtobedueto 
'experience';the 
certain 
sort 
is 
ascribed 
to 
the 
'organic 
structure' 
of 
the 
mind. 
This 
structure 
is 
in 
turn 
supposed 
by 
the 
so-called 
apriorists 
to 
be 
of 
transcendentalorigin,oratanyratenottobeexplicablebyexperience;
whilst 
by 
evolutionary 
empiricists 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
also 
due 
to 
experience,onlynottotheexperienceoftheindividual,buttothatofhisancestors 
as 
far 
back 
as 
one 
may 
please 
to 
go. 
Our 
emotional 
and 
instinctive 
tendencies, 
our 
irresistible 
impulses 
to 
couple 
certain 
movements 
with 
the 
perception 
or 
thought 
of 
certain 
things, 
are 
also 
features 
of 
our 
connate 
mental 
structure, 
and 
like 
the 
necessary 
judgments, 
are 
interpreted 
by 
the 
apriorists 
and 
the 
empiricists 
in 
the 
samewarringways.Ishalltryinthecourseofthechaptertomakeplain 
three 
things: 
1) 
That, 
taking 
the 
word 
experience 
as 
it 
is 
universally 
understood, 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
race 
can 
no 
more 
account 
for 
our 
necessary 
or 
a 
priori 
judgments 
than 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
individual 
can; 


2)Thatthereisnogoodevidenceforthebeliefthatourinstinctivereactionsarefruitsofourancestors'educationinthemidstofthesame 
environment,transmittedtousatbirth. 
3) 
That 
the 
features 
of 
our 
organic 
mental 
structure 
cannot 
be 
explained 
at 
all 
by 
our 
conscious 
intercourse 
with 
the 
outer 

environment, 
but 
must 
rather 
be 
understood 
as 
congenital 
variations, 
'accidental'1inthefirstinstance,butthentransmittedasfixedfeatures 
oftherace. 


Onthewhole,then,theaccountwhichtheaprioristsgiveofthefacts 
is 
that 
which 
I 
defend; 
although 
I 
should 
contend 
(as 
will 
hereafter 
appear)foranaturalisticviewoftheircause. 


The 
first 
thing 
I 
have 
to 
say 
is 
that 
all 
schools 
(however 
theyotherwisediffer)mustallowthattheelementaryqualitiesofcold,heat,
pleasure, 
pain, 
red, 
blue, 
sound, 
silence, 
etc., 
are 
original, 
innate, 
or 
a 
priori 
properties 
of 
our 
subjective 
nature, 
even 
though 
they 
should 
requirethetouchofexperiencetowakenthemintoactualconsciousness,
andshouldslumber,toalleternity,withoutit. 


Thisissooneitherofthetwohypotheseswemaymakeconcerningtherelationofthefeelingstotherealitiesatwhosetouchtheybecomealive. 
For 
in 
thefirst 
place, 
ifafeelingdo 
notmirror 
therealitywhich 
wakens 
it 
and 
to 
which 
we 
say 
it

mirror 
the 
reality

still 
it

it 
is 
a 
duplicationofit,theresultofamentalreaction.Andthatthemindshouldhavethepowerofreactinginjustthatduplicatewaycanonlybestatedasaharmonybetweenitsnatureandthenatureofthetruthoutsideofit,
aharmonywherebyitfollowsthatthequalitiesofbothpartiesmatch. 


Theoriginalityoftheseelementsisnot,then,aquestionfordispute.
The 
warfare 
of 
philosophers 
is 
exclusively 
relative 
to 
their 
FORMS 
OF 
COMBINATION. 
The 
empiricist 
maintains 
that 
these 
forms 
can 
only 
followthe 
orderofcombinationin 
whichthe 
elements 
wereoriginallyawakenedbytheimpressionsoftheexternalworld;theaprioristsinsist, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
that 
some 
modes 
of 
combination, 
at 
any 
rate, 
follow 
from 
the 
natures 
of 
the 
elements 
themselves, 
and 
that 
no 
amount 
of 
experiencecanmodifythisresult.

how 
often 
experience 
undoes 
her 
own 
work, 
and 
for 
an 
earlier 
order 
substitutes 
a 
new 
one. 
'The

in

that

The

from

been 
the 
opponent 
of 
theological 
modes 
of 
thought. 
The 
word 
experience 
has 
a

of 
anti-super-naturalism 
about 
it;

that

'Experience' 
does 
not 
mean 
every 
natural, 
as 
opposed 
to 
every

cause.

'inner

(in 
Spencer's 
phrase) 
'corresponds'tothe'outerrelation'whichproducedit,byremembering 
and 
knowing 
the 
latter. 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
other 
sort 
of 
natural 
agency, 
what 
is

to

Thedegreeofcohesionofour

is, 
in 
this 
part 
of 
our

proportionate, 
in 
Mr.

And 
the 
random

are 
due 
entirely 
to 
these

which 
vary 
enormouslyfrombraintobrain,

The

owe 
their

to 
causes 
which 
correspond 
far 
more 
to 
the 
sourings 
and 
fermentations 
of 
dough, 
the 
setting 
of

or 
the 
subsidence 
of

in

than 
to 
the 
manipulations 
by 
which 
these 
physical 
aggregates 
came 
to 
be 
compounded. 
Our

The 
only 
clear 
thing 
about 
the

seems 
to 
be 
its 
interstitial

the 
certainty

therefore 
the

First, 
consider 
the 
nature 
of

The

of

and 
keep 
the 
creatures 
in 
a 
void 
eternity, 
with 
naught 
but 
their 
memories 
to 
muse 
upon. 
Inevitably 
in 
their 
long

they

In 
noticing 
the 
differences 
and 
resemblances 
of 
things, 
and 
their 
degrees, 
the 
mind 
feels 
its 
own 
activity,

has 
given 
the 
name 
of 
comparisonthereto.Itneednotcompareitsmaterials,butifoncerousedto

it 
can 
compare

of 
the 
nature 
of

themselves.

InChapterXIIwesawthatthemindcanatsuccessivemomentsmean 
the

that 
it 
gradually 
comes 
into 
possession 
of 
a

of 
permanent

fixed 
meanings, 
ideal 
objects,

conceptions, 
some 
of 
which 
are 
universal 
qualities, 
like 
the 
black

We 
now

(though

These 
truths 
of 
comparison 
result 
in 
Classifications. 
It 
is, 
for 
some 
unknown 
reason, 
a, 
great 
æsthetic 
delight 
for 
the 
mind 
to 
break 
the 
orderofexperience,andclassitsmaterialsinserialorders,proceedingfrom

to

difference, 
and 
to 
contemplate 
untiringly 
the 
crossings 
and 
inosculations 
of 
the 
series 
among 
themselves. 
The 
first 
steps 
in 
most 
of 
the 
sciences 
are 
purely 
classificatory. 
Where 
facts 
fall 
easilyintorichandintricateseries(asplantsandanimalsandchemicalcompounds

So 
far 
as 
the 
facts 
of

can 
not 
be 
serially 
classified, 
therefore, 
sofarexperience 
fails 
to

ofthe

TheLogic-Series. 


Closely 
akin 
to 
the 
function 
of 
comparison 
is 
that 
of 
judging, 
predicating, 
or 
subsuming. 
In 
fact, 
these 
elementary 
intellectual 
functions 
run 
into 
each 
other 
so, 
that 
it 
is 
often 
only 
a 
question 
of 
practicalconveniencewhetherweshallcallagivenmentaloperationbythe 
name 
of 
one 
or 
of 
the 
other. 
Comparisons 
result 
in 
groups 
of 
like 
things; 
and 
presently 
(through 
discrimination 
and 
abstraction) 
in 
conceptionsoftherespectsinwhichthelikenessesobtain. 
Thegroups 
are 
genera, 
or 
classes, 
the 
respects 
are 
characters 
or 
attributes.

Thus 
horses 
are 
quadrupeds,

In 
such 
a 
series 
as 
this 
the 
several 
couplings 
of 
terms 
may 
have 
been 
made 
out 
originally 
at 
widely 
different 
times 
and 
under 
different 
circumstances.

has 
all 
the 
attributes 
of 
that 
attribute;ormorebrieflystill,thatwhateverisofakindisofthatkind's

A 
little 
explanation 
of 
this 
statement 
will 
bring 
out 
all 
that 
it 
involves. 


WelearnedinthechapteronReasoningwhatourgreatmotiveisforabstracting

It 
is

The

series

b, 
b 
is 
c, 
c 
is 
d, 
.

resembles 
for 
certain 
practical 
purposes 
the 
equation-series 
a 
= 
b, 
b 
= 
c, 
c 
= 
d, 
etc. 
But 
what 
is 
our 
purpose 
in 
predicating? 
Ultimately, 
it 
may 
be 
anything 
we 
please; 
but 
proximately 
and 
immediately, 
it 
is 
always 
the 
gratification 
of 
a 
certain 



curiosityastowhethertheobjectinhandisorisnotofakindconnectedwith

Now 
please 
note 
that 
this 
elimination 
of 
intermediary 
kinds 
and 
transfer 
of

along 
the 
line,

The 
principle 
of 
mediate 
subsumption 
thus 
expresses 
relations 
of 
ideal 
objects 
as 
such. 
It 
can 
be 
discovered 
by 
a 
mind 
left 
at 
leisure 
with 
any 
set 
of 
meanings 
(however 
originallyobtained),ofwhichsomearepredicableofothers.Themomentwestringthem

moment 
we 
see 
that 
we 
can 
dropintermediaries,useremotetermsjustlikenearones,andputagenusinthe 
place 
of 
a 
species. 
This 
shows 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
mediate 
subsumption 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
particular 
order 
of 
our 
experiences, 
or 
with 
the 
outer 
coexistences 
and

of

they

andnothingmore.Themathematicalsciencesdealwithsimilaritiesand 
equalities 
exclusively, 
andnotwith 
coexistences 
and

Hence 
they

in 
the

no

with

of

respectively. 


Number 
seems 
to 
signify 
primarily 
the 
strokes 
of 
our 
attention 
in 
discriminating 
things. 
These 
strokes 
remain 
in 
the 
memory 
in

but 
still 
the

We 
thus 
distinguish 
between 
our 
acts 
of 
counting 
and 
those 
of 
interrupting 
or

as 
between

The 
empiricist 
school 
has 
strangely 
tried 
to 
interpret 
the 
truthsofnumberasresultsofcoexistencesamongoutwardthings.John 
Millcallsnumberaphysicalpropertyofthings.'One,'accordingtoMill,

'three'athird.Thesamethings,however,cangiveusdifferentnumbersensations.

The 
indefeasibilityofourbeliefintheir 
'co-existence'(whichisMill'sword 
for 
their

is 
due 
solely 
to 
the 
enormous

of

The

numerical 
form, 
not

The 
relation 
of 
numbers 
to 
experience 
is 
just 
like 
that 
of 
'kinds' 
in 
logic.Solongasanexperiencewillkeepitskindwecanhandleitbylogic. 



So 
long 
as 
it 
will 
keep 
its

we 
can 
deal 
with 
it 
by 
arithmetic. 
Sensibly,however,thingsareconstantlychangingtheirnumbers,justasthey 
are 
changing 
their 
kinds. 
They 
are 
forever 
breaking 
apart 
and 
fusing. 
Compoundsandtheirelementsare 
never 
numerically

for 
the

are 
sensibly

and 
the

sensibly

that

in

Wehaveadefiniteideaofwhatwemeanbyeachofthesewords;andwhen

Straight

as 
they 
figure 
in

are 
mere 
inventions 
of

The 
other 
two 
axioms 
peculiar 
to 
geometry 
are 
that 
figures 
can 
be 
moved 
in

without

and 
that 
no

The 
axiom 
about

in

is 
rather 
a 
postulate 
than 
an 
axiom. 
So

as 
theyare 
so 
movable, 
then 
certainfixedequalitiesanddifferencesobtainbetweenforms,nomatterwhere

But 
if 
translation 
through 
space 
warped 
or 
magnified 
forms, 
then 
the 
relations 
of

etc., 
would

This

which

amazingly 
from

leave 
identical 
relations 
between

and 
thus 
arises 
a 
perception 
of 
relations 
between 
things 
so 
naturally 
separate 
that 
we 
shouldotherwiseneverhavecomparedthemtogetheratall. 


The 
axiom 
of 
skipped 
intermediaries 
applies, 
however, 
only 
to 
certain 
particular 
series, 
and 
among 
them 
to 
those 
which 
we

It

Locke 
accordingly 
distinguishes 
between 
'mental 
truth' 
and 
'real 
truth.'25 
The 
former 
is 
intuitively 
certain; 
the 
latter 
dependent 
on 
experience. 
Only 
hypothetically 
can 
we 
affirm 
intuitive 
truths 
of 
real 
things

Westillhaveto 
"gotoour

to

The

of 
the 
intuitionist

is 
thus 
a 
barren 
victory.

Sensible

are

for 
the

philosophy. 
The

we 
instinctively 
believe 
in 
do 
not 
exist. 
The

a

The 
search 
for 
them 
is 
the 
business 
of 
the 
experimental 
division 
of 
our 
Science. 
Its 
theoretic 
division, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
tries 
to 
discover 
the 
unknown 
causes 
of 
processes 
from 
their

tries

them

Whether

in

Now 
in

we 
have 
already

changelessforces(indestructiblequalities),

If, 
then,

the

or, 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
forces 
are 
motor 
forces 
dependent 
for 
their

only 
on

More 
exactly 
still: 
The

the

Nor 
are 
the 
moral 
judgments 
those 
most 
invariably 
and 
emphatically 
impressed

that

Iwillnowsumupourprogresssofarbyashortsummaryofthemostimportantconclusionswhichwehavereached. 


The 
mind 
has 
a 
native 
structure 
in 
this 
sense, 
that 
certain 
of 
its 
objects,ifconsideredtogetherincertainways,givedefiniteresults;andthatnootherwaysofconsidering, 
andnootherresults, 
arepossibleif 
thesameobjectsbetaken. 


The 
results 
are 
'relations' 
which 
are 
all 
expressed 
by 
judgments 
of 
subsumptionandofcomparison. 


Thejudgmentsofsubsumptionarethemselvessubsumedunderthelawsoflogic. 


Those 
of 
comparison 
are 
expressed 
in 
classifications, 
and 
in 
the 
sciencesofarithmeticandgeometry. 


Mr.Spencer'sopinionthatourconsciousnessofclassificatory,logical, 



andmathematicalrelationsbetweenideasisduetothefrequencywithwhichthecorresponding'outerrelations'haveimpressedourminds,is 
unintelligible. 


Ourconsciousnessoftheserelations,nodoubt,hasanaturalgenesis.
But 
it 
is 
to 
be 
sought 
rather 
in 
the 
inner 
forces 
which 
have 
made 
the 
braingrow,thaninanymerepathsof'frequent'associationwhichouter

But

Wedistinguish, 
therefore,

The 
two 
most 
prominent 
suggestions 
as 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
instincts 
may 
have 
been 
evolved 
are 
associated 
with 
the 
names 
of 



LamarckandDarwin. 


Lamarck's 
statement 
is 
that 
animals 
have 
wants, 
and 
contract, 
to 
satisfythem,habitswhichtransformthemselvesgraduallyintosomanypropensities 
which 
they 
can 
neither 
resist 
nor 
change. 
These 
propensities, 
once 
acquired, 
propagate 
themselves 
by

of

anteriorlytoallexercise.Thusarethesameemotions,thesamehabits,
thesameinstincts,perpetuatedwithoutvariationfromonegenerationtoanother, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
outward 
conditions 
of 
existence 
remain 
the 
same.37 
Mr. 
Lewes 
calls 
this 
the 
theory 
of 
'lapsed 
intelligence.' 
Mr. 
Spencer's 
words 
are 
clearer 
than 
Lamarck's, 
so 
that 
I 
will 
quote 
from 
him:38 


"Setting 
out 
with 
the 
unquestionable 
assumption, 
that 
every 
new 
formofemotionmakingitsappearanceintheindividualortheraceisamodificationofsomepre-existingemotion,oracompoundingofseveralpre-existing 
emotions, 
we 
should 
be 
greatly 
aided 
by 
knowing 
what 
always 
are 
the 
pre-existing 
emotions. 
When, 
for 
example, 
we 
find 
that 
veryfew,ifany,oftheloweranimalsshowanyloveofaccumulation,andthatthisfeelingisabsentininfancy;whenweseethataninfantinarmsexhibits 
anger, 
fear, 
wonder, 
while 
yet 
it 
manifests 
no 
desire 
of 
permanent 
possession; 
and 
that 
a 
brute 
which 
has 
no 
acquisitiveemotioncanneverthelessfeelattachment,jealousy,loveofapprobation, 
--we 
may 
suspect 
that 
the 
feeling 
which 
property 
satisfies 
is 
compoundedoutofsimpleranddeeperfeelings.Wemayconcludethat 
as 
when 
a 
dog 
hides 
a 
bone 
there 
must 
exist 
in 
him 
a 
prospectivegratificationofhunger,sotheremustsimilarly,atfirst,inallcaseswhereanythingissecuredortakenpossessionof,existanidealexcitementofthe 
feeling

that 
thing

Wemayfurtherconcludethatwhentheintelligenceissuchthatavarietyofobjectscometobeutilizedfor 
different 
purposes; 
when, 
as 
among 
savages, 
divers 
wants 
are 
satisfiedthroughthearticlesappropriatedforweapons,shelter,clothing,
ornament, 
--the 
act 
of 
appropriating 
comes 
to 
be 
one 
constantlyinvolvingagreeableassociations,andonewhichisthereforepleasurable,
irrespective 
of 
the 
end 
subserved. 
And 
when, 
as 
in 
civilized 
life, 
the 
property 
acquired 
is 
of 
a 
kind 
not 
conducing 
to 
one 
order 
of 
gratifications, 
but 
is 
capable 
of 
ministering 
to 
all 
gratifications, 
the 



pleasure 
of 
acquiring 
property 
grows 
more 
distinct 
from 
each 
of 
the 
variouspleasuressubserved 
--ismorecompletelydifferentiatedintoaseparateemotion.39Itiswellknownthatonnewly-discoveredislandsnotinhabitedbyman,birdsaresodevoidoffearastoallowthemselvestobeknockedoverwithsticks,butthatinthecourseofgenerationstheyacquiresuchadreadofmanastoflyonhisapproach,andthatthisdreadis 
manifested

as

as

Now 
unless 
this

be 
ascribedtothekillingoffoftheleastfearful, 
andthepreservationandmultiplicationofthemorefearful,which,consideringthesmallnumberkilledbyman,isaninadequatecause,itmustbeascribedtoaccumulatedexperiences, 
and 
each 
experience 
must 
be 
held 
to 
have 
a 
share 
in 
producing 
it. 
We 
must 
conclude 
that 
in 
each

that

and

And 
we 
must 
further 
conclude 
that 
the 
state 
of 
consciousness 
whichimpelsthebirdtotakeflightisatfirstnothingmorethananidealreproductionofthosepainfulimpressionswhichbeforefollowedman's

that 
such 
ideal

becomes 
more

and 
more 
massiveasthepainfulexperiences,directorsympathetic,increase;andthat 
thus 
the 
emotion, 
in 
its 
incipient 
state, 
is 
nothing 
else 
than 
an 
aggregationoftherevivedpainsbeforeexperienced.As,inthecourseofgenerations,theyoungbirdsofthisracebegintodisplayafearofmanbeforetheyhavebeeninjuredbyhim,itisanunavoidableinferencethatthenervoussystemoftheracehasbeenorganicallymodifiedbytheseexperiences;wehavenochoicebuttoconcludethatwhenayoungbirdisthusledtofly,itisbecausetheimpressionproducedonitssensesbytheapproaching

a 
partialexcitementofallthosenerveswhich,initsancestors,hadbeenexcitedunder 
the 
like 
conditions; 
that 
this 
partial 
excitement 
has 
its 
accompanying 
painful 
consciousness; 
and 
that 
the 
vague 
painful 
consciousness 
thus 
arising 
constitutes 
emotion 
proper 
--emotion, 
undecomposable 
into 
specific 
experiences, 
and 
therefore 
seemingly 
homogeneous.Ifsuchbetheexplanationofthefactinthiscase,thenitis 
inallcases. 
Iftheemotionissogeneratedhere,thenitissogenerated

If 
so, 
we 
must 
perforce 
conclude 
that 
the 
emotional 
modificationsdisplayedbydifferentnations,andthosehigheremotions 



bywhichcivilizedaredistinguishedfromsavage,aretobeaccountedfor 
on 
the 
same 
principle. 
And, 
concluding 
this, 
we 
are 
led 
strongly 
to 
suspectthattheemotionsingeneralhaveseverallythusoriginated."40 


Obviously 
the 
word 
'emotion' 
here 
means 
instinct 
as 
well, 
--the 
actions 
we 
call 
instinctive 
are 
expressions 
or 
manifestations 
of 
the 
emotionswhosegenesisMr.Spencerdescribes.Nowifhabitcouldthus 
bearfruitoutsidetheindividuallife,andifthemodificationssopainfullyacquiredbytheparents'nervoussystemscouldbefoundready-madeat 
birth 
in 
those 
of 
the 
young, 
it 
would 
be 
hard 
to 
overestimate 
the 
importance, 
both 
practical 
and 
theoretical, 
of 
such 
an 
extension 
of 
its 
sway. 
In 
principle, 
instincts 
would 
then 
be 
assimilated 
to 
'secondarilyautomatic' 
habits, 
and 
the 
origin 
of 
many 
of 
them 
out 
of 
tentative 
experiments 
made 
during 
ancestral 
lives, 
perfected 
by 
repetition, 
addition, 
and 
association 
through 
successive 
generations, 
would 
be 
a 
comparativelysimplethingtounderstand. 


Contemporary 
students 
of 
instinct 
have 
accordingly 
been 
alert 
to 
discover 
all 
the 
facts 
which 
would 
seem 
to

the
