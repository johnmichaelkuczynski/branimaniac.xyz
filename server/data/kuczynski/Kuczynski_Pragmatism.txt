# Positions Extracted from "Pragmatism: Epistemology Posing as Metaphysics"

## Critique of James's Pragmatist Definitions

1. James's five definitions of pragmatism are all false but express distorted versions of legitimate insights about knowledge acquisition
2. The relationship between a hypothesis and its observable consequences is always contingent, never analytic
3. A hypothesis is not equivalent to the description of its observable consequences
4. Observable consequences depend on operative conditions and causal mechanisms
5. One can accept a hypothesis while denying specific observational predictions without self-contradiction
6. Observational equivalence only guarantees actual equivalence when it is analytic (built into meanings)
7. When observational equivalence requires knowledge of physics to establish, the claims make different assertions about the world
8. Two hypotheses being observationally equivalent for reasons of natural law does not make them the same hypothesis
9. The pragmatist position that truth is usefulness is false
10. A claim's usefulness is derived from its truth, presupposing a distinction between truth and usefulness
11. The realist can explain why useful claims are useful; the pragmatist cannot
12. The nature and degree of a claim's usefulness varies from person to person
13. The nature and degree of a claim's usefulness varies from time to time
14. The realist can explain variability in usefulness; the pragmatist cannot
15. True ideas tend to be more assimilable than false ones (trivially true)
16. For an idea to be true is NOT for it to be assimilable (pragmatist error)
17. There are highly assimilable false ideas and highly non-assimilable true ones
18. The tight connection between truth and assimilability is partly an appearance born of selection bias
19. People are dismissive or ignorant of ideas irrelevant to their lives
20. The pragmatist has no way to explain variability in the connection between truth and assimilability
21. The realist explains assimilability as a contingent, circumstance-specific reflection of truth
22. "Truth happens to an idea" is opaque and false when taken literally
23. The claim that truth accrues to an idea merely presupposes that truth equals usefulness without providing independent evidence
24. Truth per se is discovered, not made
25. Knowledge, however, is indeed made (in contrast to truth)

## Categories and Constructs

26. Knives, forks, nations, economies, and armies are NOT merely projective constructs
27. A construct won't be useful unless it tracks objective realities
28. Useful constructs must be hewed to existing causal mechanisms
29. The blade and handle constitute a single object because they form a predictively robust ensemble
30. Practical interests wouldn't be well-served unless constructed collectives have causal and predictive integrity
31. We group things (people into nations, bricks into houses, stars into galaxies) because such groups have dynamic cohesiveness
32. Grouped entities support otherwise hard-to-generate predictions and explanations
33. "Fictions" that are useful track actual causal mechanisms
34. Higher-order entities (nations, people) exist derivatively of more fundamental entities
35. Higher-order entities are causally coherent and constitute undeniably real causal systems
36. A "fiction" isn't useful unless it tracks real causal mechanisms, in which case it isn't really a fiction
37. Scientific discoveries tend to give fine-grained knowledge of causal mechanisms embodied in pre-theoretical cognitive schemata
38. Scientists don't tell us water doesn't exist; they tell us what water is
39. Pre-theoretical categories would be utterly useless unless they represented actual fault-lines in nature

## Pragmatism Reinterpreted as Epistemology

40. Pragmatism has tremendous value as a description of knowledge acquisition, not of truth per se
41. Ideas acquire the property of being knowledge; they do not typically start out as knowledge
42. Acceptance can become increasingly informed and justified over time, becoming knowledge-constitutive
43. The property of being knowledge "happens" to beliefs through justification
44. Knowledge is made in two senses: generating the belief, and constructing its justification
45. Beliefs become knowledge through a process of justification-construction
46. Knowledge is acquired by being constructed
47. Knowledge is assimilated truth
48. Beliefs become increasingly knowledge-constitutive as they become increasingly grounded
49. Instances of knowledge are ipso facto empowering
50. The property of being power-enhancing belongs to knowledge of truths, not to truths per se
51. It isn't truth that is empowering; it is knowledge
52. Our knowledge of a hypothesis's veracity is based on its observable consequences (truistically true)

## The Essence of Pragmatism

53. What James's five theses have in common is combatting an "intellectualist" conception of knowledge
54. Pragmatism replaces an object-oriented conception of knowledge with an agent-oriented one
55. Classical Epistemology suggests knowledge-acquisition is about passively taking in what exists
56. Classical Epistemology implies knowledge-acquisition is antithetical to action
57. Classical Epistemology holds that actions in science are mere precursors to passive observation
58. Classical Epistemology may be true in some narrow technical sense
59. Intellectual discoveries are made by solving practical problems
60. Insights are the "collateral damage" of workarounds to practical roadblocks
61. Much of physics is fallout of attempts to create better weapons and dams
62. Much of mathematics is constructed to validate physics
63. Economics was invented to manage the influx of wealth from the New World into Europe
64. Anthropology was invented to help Europeans interact with colonized natives
65. Psychoanalysis was developed to solve otherwise unsolvable psychiatric problems

## Philosophy and Historical Context

66. "Purely philosophical" problems are not in fact purely philosophical
67. Modern epistemology came into existence in the mid-1600s alongside modern physics and engineering
68. Church doctrines lost credibility because they interfered with scientific progress
69. With faith-based epistemology no longer possible, philosophers developed non-dogmatic epistemologies
70. Cartesian skepticism and Lockean empiricism arose from the need for non-dogmatic epistemology
71. The discipline of logic began in the mid-1800s with Boole's objective to automate reasoning
72. Logic emerged precisely when physical production was being automated (not coincidental)
73. Once a discipline is launched, it can and should concern itself with "purely theoretical" problems
74. "Purely theoretical" problems are problems relating to mutual coherence of discoveries made solving practical problems
75. Calculus was invented to compute planetary orbits and ballistics-related problems
76. "Purely theoretical" questions about infinitesimals and fractals arose only because they validated an enormously useful belief-system

## Theory vs. Practice

77. "Purely theoretical" knowledge tends to be stale and one-dimensional
78. "Book knowledge" of principles often proves useless in practice
79. Formal learning provides schemata based on principles, not the principles themselves
80. Real understanding requires relearning principles to solve practical problems
81. Pure theory tends to concern itself with mere schemata
82. "Theoretical knowledge" tends to be stale and one-dimensional when unanchored from practice
83. The theorems of trigonometry are useful because they are true, not the other way around
84. Truths are learned—and are worth learning—because they are useful
85. Theoretical knowledge should exist as long as it is anchored in practical knowledge
86. When theoretical knowledge ceases to be anchored in practice, it degenerates into knowledge of empty formalisms
87. While absurd to identify the true with the useful, it is not absurd to identify truth-worth-learning with the useful

## Nature of Truth and Knowledge

88. Truth is objective (either there is an even number of stars or there isn't)
89. The truth of a matter may not be worth knowing
90. Knowledge is a relationship between subject and object—between mind and world
91. There is a subjective side to knowledge
92. The intellect exists biologically to help the organism survive and procreate
93. In human beings, intellect has to some extent become autonomous
94. The applied mathematician is interested in mathematical relations because of practical applications
95. The pure mathematician is interested in relations "for their own sake"
96. The pure mathematician studies coherence-relations internal to a dataset of practical interest
97. The philosopher investigates coherence-relations internal to datasets of practical application
98. In "disinterestedly" contemplating truth, the theoretician exercises his ability to do what the practitioner does
99. The theoretician is to the practitioner what the martial artist is to the soldier
100. The practitioner determines what the theoretician studies and the general lines of study

## Art and Theory

101. Like the engineer, the artist organizes matter (paint, marble, sound)
102. The engineer is interested in material relations for practical applications; the artist "for their own sake"
103. The artist is interested either in deepening understanding of relations or exercising ability to understand them
104. The artist appears to have turned his back on reality only because he is exercising his ability to engage it
105. Interest in truth or beauty "for their own sake" concerns the cognitive basis of our ability to generate practical results
106. James's thesis that truth is utility, though false, is a distorted expression of the truth about the practical grounding of theoretical knowledge
