## Part I: The Economics of Higher Education

### On What Universities Sell

1. Universities sell degrees, not instruction.
2. People pay universities for degrees and for nothing besides (with minor qualifications).
3. If a university stopped issuing degrees but improved instruction and lowered tuition, its enrollment would plummet (possibly to zero).
4. A degree functions like a union card—it's a prerequisite for professional entry regardless of actual competence.
5. People with degrees have options; people without degrees don't.
6. People without degrees are stuck with blue-collar work, hustling, or long-shot entrepreneurship.
7. The entrepreneurial success rate is approximately 1%, and most of that 1% have college degrees and degree-based professional experience.

### On Retention and Graduation Rates

8. Retention rates and graduation rates track each other but are not identical.
9. Retention rates are necessarily at least as high as graduation rates.
10. Universities have cogent financial reasons to want high retention rates (continued business).
11. Universities have less strong reasons to want high graduation rates (students who never graduate pay more over time).
12. Universities with extremely low retention and graduation rates almost always stay in business.
13. There is no documented case of a university failing due to low retention rates.
14. What matters financially is enrollment rates, not retention rates.
15. Low retention rates do not necessarily indicate institutional failure—they may indicate the institution serves students on the cusp of being able to complete degrees.
16. Soon-to-be dropouts are profitable: they pay for time they're not there and make minimal demands on university resources.
17. Universities with low retention rates scale down services and set prices accordingly.

### On Why Universities Cannot/Will Not Improve

18. If a university made systemic changes to improve retention, it would lose most of its existing customer base.
19. Universities would lose far more customers than they would gain by making courses financially more worth doing.
20. Universities are extremely reluctant to change.
21. Universities don't have to change.
22. Universities would alienate both customers and employees if they changed—especially if changes involved making them better at teaching or producing employable graduates.
23. Universities cannot significantly improve or alter the quality of their educational services without imperiling their very existences.
24. Universities couldn't improve the quality of their services even if they wanted to.
25. Apart from a few religions, no institutions are as unwilling to change and resistant to being tinkered with as universities.

### On the University Business Model vs. Open Market Companies (OMCs)

26. OMCs sell products and services that actually have to be good; there's no other reason to buy them.
27. Universities sell prestige backed by degrees, not quality instruction.
28. A degree from Harvard obtained entirely through cheating (without getting caught) is still enormously powerful social capital.
29. OMCs can turn on a dime—replace labor forces, change products, fire CEOs. Universities cannot.
30. OMCs must be flexible because they must meet changing consumer demands; universities need not be.

### On Instruction Quality and Student Demand

31. When averaged over time and subjects, instruction at universities must rise above a certain threshold—but only just above it.
32. A university won't come to grief if it always provides execrable instruction in some subjects or sometimes provides execrable instruction in all subjects.
33. Most of a university's business depends on providing instruction that is on average lackluster.
34. Most students are just buying a degree; only a few are really working for it.
35. The degree has prestige because of the efforts of those few.
36. The ideal situation for a university is when its degrees have prestige and as few people as possible are responsible for giving them that prestige.
37. Setting aside ~15% of students who major in engineering, nursing, etc., students don't want particularly high-quality instruction.
38. High-quality instruction is demanding; since students are paying for degrees, they want minimal hoops.
39. Students do want to believe their degrees have meaning—they're willing to jump through some hoops.
40. If universities made instruction more demanding, they would attract more savants, truth-seekers, and aspiring doctors/engineers—but for each such student gained, they'd lose ten existing customers.

### On What Students Actually Want

41. People want to be employed, but they don't necessarily want to be employable (i.e., useful).
42. If someone is employed because they're useful, they're employed only as long as they're useful—job security is contingent.
43. A life of usefulness is not easy (e.g., 60-year-old nurses cleaning infected wounds).
44. What most college students want is to be relatively useless and employed.
45. If someone useless has stable employment, their employment isn't contingent on being useful.
46. Nobody expects redundant bureaucrats and middle managers to be useful—that's not why they're employed.
47. Jobs serving well-defined practical functions are easily lost; jobs with ill-defined functions are secure.
48. If one is employed only because useful, earnings wax and wane with degree of usefulness.
49. People who make their living by being useful tend not to have inflated salaries.
50. People with ill-defined functions may have enormously inflated salaries.
51. Most college graduates end up as well-paid pencil-pushers in corporations or government agencies—well-paid for doing little more than showing up and not making waves.
52. Political science majors know their major doesn't make them useful—that's part of why they do it.
53. A "successful" political science major tends to end up with a well-paying job without well-defined functions—therefore relatively secure.
54. If colleges made students more "employable" by making them more "useful," they would alienate most students.

### The Paradox of Macroeconomic Efficiency

55. In a micro-economy (100 people), everyone must be useful and pull their weight.
56. In economies of scale with enormous division of labor, only a small percentage of the population actually has to produce.
57. The more advanced an economy, the greater the percentage of people who can be useless.
58. In the U.S. in 2019, most jobs are useless—because they can be, since the productive minority is so productive.
59. Until the useful percentage drops too close to zero, it is not irrational for people to do easy majors and bide time until landing a well-paid sinecure.

### On Dropping Out

60. The "tragedy" of high dropout rates is not really a tragedy.
61. When people drop out, it is usually for good reasons.
62. It isn't successful engineering or nursing majors who drop out—it's people barely getting by in political science or criminal justice.
63. When people drop out, it's usually because they stand to lose more by staying than by dropping out—and they're usually right.
64. Dropping out is often part of a hedging strategy—people who drop out can usually go back.
65. People who drop out often become plumbers, electricians, police officers, etc., and may find these careers more fulfilling and equally lucrative as the white-collar alternatives.
66. Dropping out is not a tragedy for the institution either—they adjust services and prices accordingly.

### On Knowledge Management and Universities

67. Knowledge Management (KM) explains how institutions must be organized to maximize the likelihood of necessary knowledge exchanges.
68. KM can help when poor internal communications prevent an institution from accomplishing what it wants.
69. KM cannot help universities because there isn't much of an issue, and insofar as there is one, poor internal communications aren't responsible.
70. Unlike OMCs, universities actually depend on poor internal communications.
71. University departments are highly isolated and fiercely independent—cooperation happens rarely, at specific junctures, in circumscribed ways, after lengthy negotiations.
72. An OMC would fail if its departments were comparably isolated.
73. OMCs are about providing optimal products/services; universities are about maintaining prestige.
74. Prestige is harder to maintain when information flows freely than when sequestered.
75. If departments cooperated whenever students would benefit, professors would face scrutiny from students not under their thumb—they'd have to step up their game considerably.
76. The kind of professor who would thrive under cross-departmental scrutiny is high-energy and demanding—most students prefer professors of the second kind (comfortable in their niche, demanding little).
77. Universities thrive on low communication between departments—on a certain lack of knowledge management.

### On the Opportunity

78. Low retention/graduation rates at universities do not represent a business opportunity for anyone.
79. Low retention/graduation rates do not represent an opportunity to do real good—making universities better would lower rates further.
80. Low retention/graduation rates do not represent an opportunity to apply KM principles—universities are positively dependent on poor internal communications.
81. The way to improve education is not to try to "fix" existing universities—they are happy as they are and both unwilling and unable to be fixed.
82. The idea that one could march into a university and fix it (and be paid to do so) is the very definition of absurdity.
83. If one wants to improve education and make money doing so, there is currently an enormous opportunity—but it involves creating something new, not fixing what exists.

## Part II: DMO—A New Kind of University

### Core Principles of DMO

84. DMO is a hypothetical online university where students pay for results, not services.
85. A degree from DMO must be proof of competence—DMO sells competence, not prestige.
86. DMO is not meant to replace brick-and-mortar institutions but to provide maximally efficient instruction in every area that can be taught digitally.
87. DMO will not teach piloting, surgery, plumbing, or other skills requiring physical presence.
88. DMO will not provide accreditations in areas (like history or religious studies) where a degree cannot constitute proof of competence.
89. What DMO offers in instruction will covary in real time with what the market needs people to know.
90. DMO will offer instruction in a dramatically wider range of subjects than any brick-and-mortar institution.
91. DMO will offer many different levels of accreditation (beyond just bachelor's, master's, doctoral).
92. Nobody who graduates from DMO will be useless—they will already be employable.
93. DMO's objective is to produce competent people, not to exclude incompetent people and take undeserved credit for graduates' merits.
94. DMO will not exclude people—unintelligent people seeking education are like sick people going to a hospital: they're there to improve.

### On KM Principles Underlying DMO

95. Knowledge management is possible when an organization has definite objectives and difficult when objectives are vague.
96. When an organization sells results, objectives are well-defined—positive consequences for KM.
97. When an organization sells services, objectives tend to be vaguely defined—negative consequences for KM.
98. When an organization sells results, prices tend to drop; when it sells services, prices tend to rise.
99. When results are sold, there's no money in services and services must be streamlined.
100. When services are sold, there's no money in results and services must be inflated.
101. Results-providers compete on efficiency; prices bid down. Service-providers compete on inefficiency; prices bid up.
102. Service organizations depend on poor KM—they make money by multiplying and drawing out services.
103. Management in service organizations profits from inefficiencies that good communication eliminates.
104. Internal communications tend to be bad when employment is guaranteed and good when it isn't.
105. Internal communications tend to be good when salaries are performance-dependent and bad when they aren't.
106. It's hard to know who's pulling their weight unless clients hire employees directly.
107. When clients cannot hire talent directly, projects go to the wrong people; talent is misdeployed and underdeployed.
108. Organization-internal communications are worthless unless based on solid information about how to engage the market.
109. The best way for an organization to have such information is for employees to offer services directly to clients.

### On Expense-Padding and Legitimacy

110. When a business is legitimate, it does not inflate costs.
111. Legitimate businesses make more money by keeping quality high and costs low.
112. Businesses are forced to pad and gouge when they don't make money by providing what they say they provide.
113. A business that thrives on inefficiency cannot give customers what they're paying for all at once—legitimate services must be dragged out and interspersed with extraneous ones.
114. Such businesses are concerned with managing expectations, not increasing efficiency.
115. If such a business is large, most employees must partially accept the company's propaganda—otherwise recruitment and motivation suffer.
116. Such companies' internal communications tend to be inefficient because it isn't clear what the company does.

### On Digitization

117. When education can be digitized, it must be digitized.
118. Digitization saves time and money and allows purchasing custom education from the best instructors at the lowest price.
119. If a university chooses not to digitize services that can be digitized, it's because it doesn't primarily make money by providing instruction.

### DMO's Examination System

120. At DMO, instructors do not issue grades—there are no grades, only accreditations.
121. Accreditations are attained by taking examinations.
122. Examinations are graded anonymously (by computer whenever possible) and designed/administered by independent third parties.
123. Questions on examinations have determinate answers—little or no expert disagreement on correct answers.
124. Instructors have access to past exams but not forthcoming ones.
125. There are many subjects (history, religious studies) that DMO simply will not teach.
126. Instructors at DMO are instructors, not gatekeepers—it doesn't matter if the instructor likes you or what they think of your work.
127. The instructor's one job is to get you to pass the accreditation exam.

### On Converting Non-STEM to STEM

128. DMO's primary solution for humanities-inclined students is to offer "lite" science degrees: lite-physics, lite-math, math for computer scientists, lite biology.
129. Many people in the humanities (especially philosophy) are actually highly intelligent but find details annoying.
130. Physics and all sciences are largely about grinding out solutions using thorny mathematics—some "big ideas" but mostly grinding out facts/theorems.
131. Because humanities people are "big idea" people, they resent the labor involved in STEM.
132. College majors being what they are, big-idea people flee from STEM (including economics) into political science, history, etc.
133. These people, despite considerable intellectual gifts, end up completely useless—no matter how advanced in political science, you're not employable (except bureaucratically).
134. Someone whose college career consists of learning the big ideas of science plus enough applications to nail down understanding is extremely useful.
135. DMO will offer "general studies in the sciences" with variants (applied sciences, biological sciences, information sciences, health sciences).

### On Instruction vs. Selection

136. Existing universities are discriminatory—they don't service all comers.
137. OMCs (Nike, Amazon, Microsoft) don't "exclude" customers.
138. The difference: OMCs sell products; universities sell prestige.
139. If universities really sold instruction (made money by making people leave more competent than they came), they'd want as many customers as possible.
140. Universities are selective because their product is weak—they're not that good at instructing people.
141. Universities are reasonably good at taking already-gifted people and pointing them in the right direction.
142. DMO has the first business model (smart-making pill for everyone); other universities have the second (vet customers because product is weak).

### On Degree Levels

143. An A in a given class at a given university tends not to mean anything.
144. Even when an A means something, its exact meaning is deeply unclear—it means different things at MIT vs. VCU.
145. Because individual classes have either no significance or no determinate significance, accreditations can only be awarded for hulkingly large pluralities of classes.
146. This is a hedging strategy—Smith must have some merit if he passes 100 classes, even if many had no meaning.
147. The less guarantee a class has merit, the larger the number of classes needed for a degree taken as proof of merit.
148. This limits the number of degree levels a university can issue.
149. If individual courses had guaranteed and determinate meanings, passing even a single class would be definite proof of a definite kind of merit.
150. At DMO, there's no such thing as a grade that isn't definitive proof of well-defined merit.
151. Therefore, a DMO student can prove high, definite merit by passing relatively few classes.
152. Therefore, DMO can credibly issue many different levels of degrees.
153. Any given course at DMO is itself a mini-degree.
154. Students can earn credible degrees from DMO in a fraction of the time and expense of conventional institutions.
155. Students have many options intermediate between no degree and spending 4-8 years accumulating debt for a degree of little significance.

### On Instructors as Non-Gatekeepers

156. DMO must always offer students the ability to "test out"—get accreditation just by passing the exam without class time.
157. This is necessary: as long as test-out is possible, students only pay instructors for actual instruction.
158. When testing out isn't possible, instructors tend to function as gatekeepers—there to open gates as they see fit, not to instruct.
159. If instructors are paid to be gatekeepers, there's no guarantee they're good instructors.

### On Direct Payment

160. At DMO, students hire instructors only if they believe the instructor can help them pass an exam the instructor doesn't grade.
161. Students will want to work with instructors who succeed at getting students to pass and avoid those who fail.
162. Students will pay more for instructors likely to get them to pass.
163. Students and instructors must negotiate prices directly.
164. If students pay DMO and DMO supplies instructors, students can't choose competent instructors and avoid incompetent ones.
165. Incompetent instructors would not pay for incompetence; competent ones wouldn't be rewarded.
166. Payments must go straight to the instructor; instructor gives a percentage to DMO for platform, volume, credibility, materials.
167. There is no permanent employment at DMO, let alone tenure—only contract work.
168. Instructor revenue is determined entirely by instructor competence.

### The Inverted Payment Pyramid

169. At conventional universities, money flows down (students → university → instructors)—result: expensive and bad education.
170. At DMO, money flows up (students → instructors, who give ~20% to DMO for overhead).
171. This makes DMO lean and functional.
172. Because students know where money goes, DMO cannot overcharge or mis-charge.
173. Since management works within that ~20%, bureaucracy is impossible.
174. Management has strong incentives to hire and retain instructors who can service large market sectors.

### The 25 Desiderata

175. DMO must be accredited—students must receive recognized degrees.
176. DMO must be online.
177. Instruction must be largely (though not entirely) individualized.
178. There must be clear, universally recognized performance benchmarks for students in all academic areas.
179. There must be similar benchmarks for instructors.
180. Students hire instructors directly.
181. Instructor rates are determined by student and instructor, not by DMO.
182. Instructor statistics must always be available to prospective students.
183. Satisfaction of benchmarks is never decided by professors—no "grades" per se, only accreditation exams.
184. Questions on accreditation exams admit of clear, unambiguous, universally recognizable answers.
185. Instructors are minimally policed—can teach what and how they want.
186. Instructors are encouraged to take performance tests and publicly display scores.
187. There is no tenure.
188. Termination is reserved for: failure to take on available students at agreed rates, and gross misconduct.
189. There must be a wider variety of disciplines and degrees than current institutions.
190. The student's situation should not be binary (degree/no degree)—there should be a score corresponding to objective accomplishments.
191. Disciplines with no practical value should be jettisoned or modified to have practical value.
192. Disciplines that don't admit objective assessments should be jettisoned or modified to admit them.
193. Universally applicable tests of intelligence and critical reasoning should be administered (free) to prove students are becoming better thinkers.
194. DMO will have past copies of all tests, but DMO instructors won't create them—outside parties generate tests not revealed to instructors until after administration.
195. Student evaluations should be minimized or eliminated—instructor merit determined by student performance, not opinion/sentiment.
196. Students should be able to switch instructors easily to prevent personal conflicts from jamming education.
197. Curricula contents should be publicly accessible so students can start working before enrolling.
198. Hirings based exclusively on proven or probable success helping students pass exams—publications and letters of reference are irrelevant.
199. Mini-majors should be offered.

### On Existing Universities (Conclusion)

200. Existing universities are failing: most degrees have no objective significance and fail to provide definitive proof of merit.
201. Universities are expensive and slow.
202. Universities are discriminatory—they prevent the people who need their services from receiving them.
203. Universities turn away people who want to study (forgivable given limited resources).
204. Universities turn their own students away from courses of study that would benefit them (far less forgivable).
205. Universities offer very few practical courses and load those with so many stumbling blocks that capable people are exiled into useless soft majors.
206. Universities wall out people who need instruction, opening gates only to people who can self-teach their way through.
207. There is little hope of reforming universities—they don't want to be reformed and don't stand to gain by being reformed.
208. This doesn't matter because there's no need to reform them—DMO can be created instead.
209. Once in existence, DMO will be the very embodiment of optimal knowledge management.
210. The right way to provide better instruction is not to make universities better but to create a new results-based educational service whose revenue is tied to pedagogical efficacy.
