POSITION STATEMENTS: KUCZYNSKI - QUOTE LIBRARY VOLUME 6
SEMANTICS, MEANING, AND LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE

================================================================================

MEANING: LINGUISTIC VS PSYCHOLOGICAL

1. Nothing meaningless is an expression.

2. Depending on how it's interpreted, 'colorless green dreams sleep furiously' either says (i) that there are dreams that are green and also colorless that sleep furiously, in which case it's false, or it says (ii) that there is nothing that is a colorless green dream that doesn't also sleep furiously, in which case it's vacuously true.

3. For x to be evidence of y, it is neither necessary nor sufficient that y cause x.

4. Meaning in the psychological sense is parasitic on meaning in the linguistic sense.

5. There are many sentences that have determinate meanings even though they've never been uttered before and, therefore, no one as of yet has ever meant anything by them.

6. Meaning in the linguistic sense is not in all cases identical with meaning in the psychological sense.

7. Psychological meaning presupposes linguistic meaning. What a person means when uttering a given sentence is a function of, among other things, his beliefs as to what that sentence already means.

8. Setting aside defective utterances, one cannot, in uttering a given sentence, mean anything by it unless one knows what it already means. So meaning in the psychological sense is parasitic on meaning in the linguistic sense, and the two kinds of meaning are therefore entirely distinct.

9. The sense in which 'snow is white' means that snow is white isn't comparable to the sense in which smoke means fire. The fact that smoke means fire has nothing to do with conventions on the part of human beings. But the fact that 'snow is white' means what it does is, at least in part, a matter of convention.

10. There is a normative dimension to language use that is absent where purely natural, non-conventional cause-effect relations are concerned.

================================================================================

EXPRESSIONS, SENTENCES, AND PROPOSITIONS

11. Anything that is assigned no meaning is ipso facto not a linguistic expression. So 'the absolute is one' is not a sentence, but a sentence-imposter.

12. Propositions, when true, are truths. Thus, propositions have existed as long as there have been truths; which means that they've existed as long as there has been anything and, consequently, that propositions are not human creations.

13. Sentences and propositions are digital structures, meaning that they have unique breakdowns into minimal significant units.

14. Visual perceptions, unlike sentences and propositions, have a non-digital or analogue structure. Given that at least some thought involves the processing of perceptual information, it follows that thought at least sometimes has a structure very different from language.

15. The proposition literally meant by my utterance is only a part of what it is that I'm saying. Thus, what a sentence literally means is only one of many factors governing what it is used to mean.

16. Something isn't a sentence until a meaning has been assigned to it. In a world where there were no animate beings, but in which a twig deposit formed the pattern (1 + 1 = 2), that twig deposit wouldn't be an expression of any kind.

================================================================================

SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS

17. The discipline of syntax studies the relation that the meanings of complex expressions bear to the meanings of the simple expressions composing them. Thus, syntax doesn't study the semantics (meanings) of complex expressions. It studies the structures of the semantics of complex expressions.

18. Semanticists supply us with the missing metaknowledge.

19. The semanticist is needed to clarify the structure of the meaning that a sentence is already known to have, but he isn't needed to identify that meaning. The semanticist isn't a translator.

20. There are many cases where the semanticist is needed to identify literal meaning. In fact, as paradoxical as it may sound, there are cases where he is needed to identify the meanings of sentences that are perfectly well understood.

21. We must distinguish what is literally meant by an utterance from what it is that the speaker wishes to convey.

22. Oftentimes, literal meaning is cloaked by the pre-semantic information through which it is grasped, and semanticists are needed to uncloak it.

================================================================================

SEMANTIC RULES AND LANGUAGE

23. A language is a systematic way of pairing off sentences with meanings.

24. Any rule that assigns a meaning to an expression is known as a 'semantic rule.' Languages are sets of semantic rules.

25. Semantic rules are rules in the strictly logical sense; that is, they are mathematical functions.

26. The rule denoted by "+" has always existed and always will.

27. Semantic rules assign meanings to non-expressions—to morphological or acoustical properties (properties that a thing has in virtue of having a certain shape or sounding a certain way).

28. Expressions aren't assigned meanings. They already have them and don't need to be assigned them. Therefore a semantic rule can't be defined as a rule that assigns a meaning to an expression.

29. The semantic and syntactic rules of English being what they are, a sentence would have its current meaning even if it had never been used. So whatever the intentions of people using that sentence are, those intentions do nothing in the way of assigning it that meaning.

30. Unlike scientific laws, semantic rules are normative. If, intending to affirm that Smith is female, you say 'Smith is male,' you've done something wrong.

31. If semantic rules are just idealizations of speaker-behavior, then speaker-behavior must pre-exist the semantic rules embodied in it. But if that's the case, then the activity described by semantic rules isn't guided by them.

32. A knowledge of semantics underlies all non-defective speech-acts.

33. If semantic rules merely describe existing semantic activity, then that activity isn't answerable to semantic norms. It is; so the Salmon-Soames view is wrong.

34. Since anything that is a linguistic expression ipso facto has a meaning (in the relevant, linguistic sense), there are no expressions to be used before noises, ink-marks, etc., have been assigned meanings.

35. An expression E's having meaning M cannot possibly be constituted by its being used in such and such a manner, since E isn't an expression and, therefore, isn't an expression to be used until it has a meaning.

================================================================================

CRITIQUE OF GRICEAN AND NEO-GRICEAN THEORIES

36. Literal meaning is to be understood in terms of speaker's meaning. That's the main idea. Neo-Griceans hold that, even though literal meaning cannot in all cases be identified with speaker's meaning, it is always, ultimately, to be understood in terms of it.

37. Expressions mean what we use them to mean—they mean what we mean by them. [This view is false.]

================================================================================

CRITIQUE OF CONCEPTUAL ROLE SEMANTICS (CRS)

38. Changes in what we believe affect what we infer from statements; but they don't categorically change the meanings of those statements.

39. CRS entails that every inference is an analytic inference.

40. What we may infer from a sentence is answerable to its existing meaning. CRS says that a sentence's meaning is answerable to what we infer from it.

41. CRS says that what a sentence means is determined by what we infer from it. Since it's the other way around, CRS is false.

================================================================================

SIMPLE VS COMPLEX EXPRESSIONS

42. Where complex expressions are concerned, there is no limit to how much literal and understood meaning may diverge from each other. But where simple expressions are concerned, literal and understood meaning must coalesce.

43. It makes no sense to suppose that people could be systematically wrong as to what 'red' meant. If people thought that 'red' meant what is in fact meant by 'blue,' then 'red' would have that meaning.

44. What a simple expression literally means is determined by what it is that a sentence means by virtue of containing it.

45. A divergence between (i) a sentence's literal meaning and (ii) that sentence's understood meaning is the same thing as a divergence between (a) that sentence's literal meaning and (b) what it is that, given their (correct) beliefs as to what its simple parts literally mean, people are disposed to take that sentence's literal meaning to be.

46. The literal meaning of a complex expression is a function of two things: (i) the meanings of its simple parts, and (ii) the order in which those parts are arranged.

47. Where simple expressions are concerned, literal and communicated meaning coincide (ultimately)—in other words, such expressions mean what people take them to mean.

================================================================================

INDEXICALS AND CONTEXT-SENSITIVITY

48. My believing it's 60° in Richmond on Feb. 07, 2009, is different from my thinking it's now 60° in Richmond, even though I am in fact in Richmond at the time in question.

49. Nothing perspectival—nothing that embodies any information relating to the speaker's perspective on the world—can be expressed without using an indexical.

50. No sentence-type containing a context-sensitive component is either true or false; for no such sentence-type says anything.

51. The meanings of sentence-tokens are propositions and the meanings of sentence-types are rules that assign propositions to their tokens, usually on the basis of facts about the context of tokening.

52. That meaning is a rule. That rule in its turn assigns meanings to tokens of that sentence. Those meanings are true or false; those meanings are propositions.

53. A semantic rule is something which assigns a rule to a property that in its turn assigns meanings to instances of that property.

54. Every sentence contains a tense-marker. And in virtue of containing a tense-marker, a sentence is such that the proposition expressed by any given one of its tokens is a function of (inter alia) when that token occurs.

55. The semantics of "I" is given by the rule that an utterance of "I" refers to a given person if and only if that person has the property of being the one that produced that utterance.

56. "I" and "that guy" are context-sensitive expressions: what such an expression refers to depends in a systematic manner on facts about the context of utterance.

57. Indexicals have a "two-dimensional" semantic structure.

58. Definite descriptions, like indexicals, have a two-dimensional semantic structure.

59. Indexical-free languages are expressively impoverished; much of what there is to say can't be said in them.

================================================================================

TYPE-TOKEN DISTINCTION

60. All expression-types have rules that assign meanings (or referents) to their tokens and, therefore, where any expression is concerned, type-meaning diverges from token-meaning.

61. Expression-tokens are physical entities—bursts of noise, deposits of ink, etc. Expression-tokens are therefore perceptible entities and are thus capable of transmitting information. Expression-types, on the other hand, are abstract entities and are thus inherently unsuited to be vehicles of communication.

62. Expression-types, unlike expression-tokens, are properties and are therefore non-spatiotemporal entities. It makes no sense to suppose a nonspatiotemporal entity could mediate information or, therefore, could in any significant sense be a symbol.

63. Given the profound metaphysical differences between tokens and types, it would be theoretical arbitrariness of the worst kind to suppose that types could discharge the same semantic functions as their tokens.

64. The need for a two-dimensionalist approach to semantics is embedded in the very concept of what an expression is.

================================================================================

LOGICAL FORM VS GRAMMATICAL FORM

65. Some statements that, given their grammatical forms, appear to be about objects are in fact about properties.

66. Frege was the first to see clearly that logical and grammatical form may diverge—he was the first to grasp the very idea of such a divergence.

67. A quantifier is an expression having the property that, if a sentence contains it, that sentence is ipso facto to the effect that the extension of one property has a certain degree of overlap, ranging anywhere from no overlap to total overlap, with the extension of some other property.

68. In natural language, quantified sentences are pseudo-objectual statements. They appear to be about objects, but are really about properties.

69. It immediately follows that a statement's grammatical form may diverge from its logical form.

70. To define an expression contextually is to show how, in virtue of containing it, a sentence's meaning is affected.

71. The meaning of 'someone' is given by the statement that: ‹Someone has psi› is true just in case the property of being a psi is instantiated.

72. In general, to say that E refers to O is to make a statement about the effect a sentence's containing E has on its truth-conditions.

================================================================================

FREGE'S CONTRIBUTIONS

73. What made it possible for Frege to revolutionize logic was his insight that grammatical and logical form diverge; and what made the latter insight possible was his generalization of the concept of a mathematical function.

74. Frege was able to assign a single form to all atomic sentences—ultimately, all atomic sentences have the form ‹O has psi.›

75. Contrary to first appearances, 'Bill is taller than Mary' has the form: the ordered pair <Bill, Mary> has psi, where psi is the property had by such a pair just in case its first member is taller than its second.

76. Frege wasn't made blind by grammatical surface structure to the underlying structural similarities.

================================================================================

ADDITIONAL SEMANTIC POSITIONS

77. The property of being smart for a dog is distinct from the property of being smart for a human.

78. ‹x is smart› expresses a proposition of the form: the degree to which x has smartness exceeds standard S, where S is some standard that, given the context, is clearly the relevant one.

79. ‹x has phi› communicates such a proposition, but it isn't because it semantically encodes it.

80. "John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass" doesn't describe a relationship between John and some non-existent or quasi-existent fish. It affirms the existence of a relationship between John and a proposition.

81. The property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches exists even if no such fish exists. The statement is about an existent property, not a non-existent fish.

82. A complete analysis of "John wants to catch a 20-pound striped bass" is: John wants it to be the case that the property of being a 20-pound striped bass that John catches is instantiated.

83. If it were believed that mathematical reality were as volatile as the stock-market, we would regard mathematical statements as being in the same category as patently context-sensitive sentences.

84. Mathematical statements' context-insensitivity is a thoroughly pragmatics-based affair, not a semantic one.
