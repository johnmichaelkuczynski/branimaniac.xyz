## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation:** Empiricism, as a foundational approach to psychology, fails to adequately explain mental phenomena because it cannot account for non-observable aspects of consciousness and mental states.

2. **Secondary Formulation:** The reduction of mental states to observable events and physiological structures, as advocated by empiricism, results in an incomplete and fragmented understanding of the mind.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Empiricism's Inability to Explain Continuities**
   - **Explanation:** Empiricism, by focusing solely on observable events, cannot embed these events within unobservable continuities, leading to a fragmented view of both the external and internal worlds. The text argues that observable events are seen as spontaneous and disconnected, which prevents a coherent explanation of these events.
   - **Supporting Passage:** "The external world would be nothing more than a collection of mutually disconnected, ex nihilo events if all there were to it was what observation revealed."

2. **Argument 2: The Limitations of Conscious Introspection**
   - **Explanation:** The text argues that if the mind were completely described by conscious experiences, it would consist of spontaneities within stretches of consciousness, which are themselves disconnected due to lapses in consciousness. This view, driven by empiricism, fails to explain the mind's integrity.
   - **Supporting Passage:** "If completely described by the information borne in his conscious experiences, a given person's mind would consist of spontaneities internal to stretches of consciousness that, flanked by lapses in consciousness, would themselves be spontaneities."

3. **Argument 3: The Inadequacy of Physiological Reductionism**
   - **Explanation:** The text critiques the view that mental events can be fully explained by physiological structures. It argues that this reductionist approach fails to account for the discontinuities within conscious experience and does not provide a complete explanation of mental phenomena.
   - **Supporting Passage:** "Since mental events are obviously mediated by physiological structures, it is widely held that the mere existence of such structures accounts for the discontinuities within conscious experience."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Argument 4: Wittgenstein's Critique of Empiricism**
   - **Explanation:** The text uses Wittgenstein's theories on meaning to critique empiricism's conflation of analytic and introspective knowledge. It argues that this conflation leads to a misunderstanding of mental states.
   - **Supporting Passage:** "Some consequences of the empiricism-driven conflation of analytic with introspective knowledge."

2. **Argument 5: Moral and Aesthetic Nihilism**
   - **Explanation:** The text links moral and aesthetic nihilism to false theories of rationality and selfhood, suggesting that these nihilistic views are a consequence of empiricist assumptions about the nature of rationality and the self.
   - **Supporting Passage:** "Moral and aesthetic nihilism as embodiments of false theories of rationality and selfhood."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Non-Observable Aspects of Consciousness are Real and Significant**
   - The text assumes that there are aspects of consciousness and mental states that are not directly observable but are crucial for understanding the mind.

2. **Assumption 2: Reductionism is Inadequate for Explaining Mental Phenomena**
   - The text assumes that reducing mental states to physiological processes or observable events does not provide a complete explanation of mental phenomena.

3. **Assumption 3: The Mind Has an Integrity Beyond Observable Events**
   - The text assumes that the mind has a continuity and integrity that cannot be fully captured by empirical observation alone.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1:** Empiricism relies solely on observable events and physiological structures to explain mental phenomena.

2. **Premise 2:** Observable events, when considered in isolation, appear as disconnected and spontaneous.

3. **Premise 3:** The mind's integrity cannot be explained by disconnected, spontaneous events.

4. **Premise 4:** Physiological structures alone cannot account for the discontinuities within conscious experience.

5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, empiricism fails to provide a complete and coherent explanation of mental phenomena.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction and Problem Statement:** The text begins by introducing the problem with empiricism and its application to psychology, setting the stage for the critique.

2. **Detailed Critique of Empiricism:** The text then delves into a detailed critique of empiricism, focusing on its inability to explain continuities in both the external and internal worlds.

3. **Wittgensteinian Analysis:** The text uses Wittgenstein's theories on meaning to further critique empiricism, particularly its conflation of analytic and introspective knowledge.

4. **Physiological Reductionism:** The text critiques the reduction of mental states to physiological structures, arguing that this approach fails to account for the discontinuities within conscious experience.

5. **Broader Implications:** The text extends its critique to broader philosophical issues, such as moral and aesthetic nihilism, linking these to empiricist assumptions about rationality and selfhood.

   - This thesis challenges the empiricist view that sentences, rather than propositions, are the relata of logical relations.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text also posits that logical relations, such as entailment, hold between propositions rather than sentences or other linguistic expressions.
   - This formulation emphasizes the derivative nature of logical relations between sentences, which are spatiotemporal entities.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Properties as Non-SpatioTemporal Entities**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that properties, such as the property of being made of water, are non-spatiotemporal. It refutes the view that properties are scattered objects by showing that altering a body of water does not affect the property of being made of water.
   - **Key Passage**: "One changes S by destroying or displacing any given body of water. But one does not, by that means or any other, do anything to affect what it is to be made of water; so one doesn't thereby affect the property of being made of water."

2. **Argument 2: Propositions Consist of Properties**
   - **Explanation**: The text asserts that propositions are composed of properties, which are non-spatiotemporal. This argument supports the thesis by establishing the nature of propositions as abstract entities.
   - **Key Passage**: "We have thus shown that (a) propositions consist of properties and that (b) properties are non-spatiotemporal."

3. **Argument 3: Logical Relations Between Propositions**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that logical relations, such as entailment, hold between propositions rather than sentences. It claims that sentences entail each other only in a derivative sense, based on the meanings they express.
   - **Key Passage**: "Therefore, it is really MA that entails MB, and it is only in a derivative sense that a entails b."

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Entailment and Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that the entailment between sentences is due to the meanings they express, which are propositions. This supports the main thesis by showing how logical relations depend on propositions.
   - **Key Passage**: "It is obviously in virtue of the fact that a and b have MA and MB for their respective meanings that a entails b."

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Empiricist Denial of Propositions**
   - **Explanation**: The text notes that empiricists deny the existence of propositions because they are non-spatiotemporal. This claim sets up the critique of empiricism and supports the thesis by highlighting the philosophical stakes.
   - **Key Passage**: "But empiricists deny (iii), as they must, since propositions, if they exist, are nonspatiotemporal."

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Abstract Entities Exist**
   - The text assumes the existence of abstract entities like properties and propositions, which is a foundational assumption for its arguments against empiricism.

2. **Assumption 2: Logical Relations Are Real**
   - The text assumes that logical relations, such as entailment, are real and not merely a product of human thought or convention.

3. **Assumption 3: Meaning Is Propositional**
   - The text assumes that the meaning of sentences is propositional, which underpins its argument that logical relations hold between propositions.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1**: Properties are non-spatiotemporal entities.
2. **Premise 2**: Propositions consist of properties.
3. **Premise 3**: Logical relations, such as entailment, hold between propositions.

2. **Russell's Theory of Descriptions**: The text's focus on properties and their relation to objects resonates with Russell's theory of descriptions and his work on the nature of propositions.

## SECTION 7: CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS

### 7.1 Key Terms and Their Definitions

1. **Property**: A property is defined as an abstract entity that is non-spatiotemporal and distinct from its instances.
   - **Key Passage**: "The property of being made of water is an object whose constituents are bodies of water."

2. **Proposition**: A proposition is defined as a non-spatiotemporal entity composed of properties, which serves as the meaning of sentences.
   - **Key Passage**: "We have thus shown that (a) propositions consist of properties and that (b) properties are non-spatiotemporal."

3. **Entailment**: Entailment is defined as a logical relation that holds between propositions, with sentences entailing each other only derivatively based on the propositions they express.
   - **Key Passage**: "Therefore, it is really MA that entails MB, and it is only in a derivative sense that a entails b."

### 7.2 Technical Vocabulary Introduced or Employed

1. **Scattered Object**: A scattered object is a spatiotemporal entity composed of non-contiguous parts, which the text argues cannot be identical to properties.
   - **Key Passage**: "This object obviously isn't spatiotemporally cohesive, and it is thus a 'scattered object.'"

2. **Relata of Logical Relations**: The relata of logical relations are the entities between which logical relations, such as entailment, hold. The text argues that these relata are propositions, not sentences.
   - **Key Passage**: "Sentences, not propositions, are the relata of logical relations."

### 7.3 Distinctions Drawn Between Related Concepts

1. **Properties vs. Instances**: The text distinguishes between properties as abstract entities and their instances as spatiotemporal objects.
   - **Key Passage**: "One changes S by destroying or displacing any given body of water. But one does not, by that means or any other, do anything to affect what it is to be made of water; so one doesn't thereby affect the property of being made of water."

2. **Propositions vs. Sentences**: The text draws a clear distinction between propositions as abstract entities and sentences as their spatiotemporal expressions.
   - **Key Passage**: "Therefore, it is really MA that entails MB, and it is only in a derivative sense that a entails b."

### 7.4 Theoretical Innovations or Neologisms

1. **Doubly Derivative Sense**: The text introduces the concept of a "doubly derivative sense" to describe how sentences entail each other based on the propositions they express and the logical principles governing those propositions.
   - **Key Passage**: "So it is only in a doubly derivative sense that x entails y: it is only relative to non-conventional, strictly logical principles that x and y mean what they do; and it is only relative to similar principles that, given that they mean what they do, x entails y."

### 7.5 Repurposing of Existing Concepts

1. **Entailment**: The text repurposes the concept of entailment to argue that it holds between propositions rather than sentences, challenging the traditional view that sentences are the primary bearers of logical relations.
   - **Key Passage**: "It is obviously in virtue of the fact that a and b have MA and MB for their respective meanings that a entails b."

2. **Properties**: The text repurposes the concept of properties to argue that they are non-spatiotemporal entities, distinct from their instances, which challenges the scattered object view.
   - **Key Passage**: "The property of being made of water is an object whose constituents are bodies of water."

## SECTION 8: ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE

### 8.1 Overall Organization of the Argument

1. **Introduction of Key Concepts**: The text begins by introducing the concept of properties and their non-spatiotemporal nature, setting the stage for the discussion on propositions.

2. **Critique of Empiricism**: It then critiques the empiricist view that denies the existence of propositions, arguing that this view leads to false consequences.

3. **Development of the Thesis**: The text develops its thesis by arguing that propositions consist of properties and that logical relations hold between these propositions.

4. **Application to Logical Relations**: It applies this thesis to the specific case of entailment, showing how sentences entail each other only derivatively based on the propositions they express.

5. **Conclusion and Implications**: The text concludes by reiterating its main points and highlighting the implications for the philosophy of language and the foundations of psychology.

### 8.2 Logical Dependencies Between Claims

1. **Claim 1**: Properties are non-spatiotemporal entities.
   - **Dependency**: This claim is foundational for the argument that propositions, which consist of properties, are also non-spatiotemporal.

2. **Claim 2**: Propositions consist of properties.
   - **Dependency**: This claim depends on the first claim and supports the argument that logical relations hold between propositions.

3. **Claim 3**: Logical relations, such as entailment, hold between propositions.
   - **Dependency**: This claim depends on the first two claims and is the central thesis of the text.

### 8.3 Progression from Premises to Conclusions

1. **Premise 1**: Properties are non-spatiotemporal entities.
2. **Premise 2**: Propositions consist of properties.
3. **Premise 3**: Logical relations, such as entailment, hold between propositions.
4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, logical relations do not hold between sentences or other spatiotemporal entities but between propositions, which are non-spatiotemporal.

### 8.4 Use of Examples, Illustrations, or Case Studies

1. **Example of Entailment**: The text uses the example of the sentences "John reads frequently" and "John is an animate object" to illustrate how entailment depends on the meanings (propositions) expressed by sentences.
   - **Key Passage**: "Let a and b be particular inscriptions of the sentences: and (A) John reads frequently. (B) John is an animate object. Of course, a entails b."

### 8.5 Anticipation and Response to Objections

1. **Anticipation of Empiricist Objection**: The text anticipates the empiricist objection that propositions do not exist because they are non-spatiotemporal.
   - **Response**: It responds by arguing that the empiricist view leads to false consequences and that logical relations require the existence of propositions.
   - **Key Passage**: "But empiricists deny (iii), as they must, since propositions, if they exist, are nonspatiotemporal."

### 8.6 Dialectical Structure (If Present)

1. **Dialectical Engagement with Empiricism**: The text engages dialectically with empiricism, presenting its arguments and then critiquing them to support its own thesis.
   - **Key Passage**: "Empiricists validate their denial of (iii) by saying that: (PN26) propositions don't exist, and by then making the correlative point that: (SR27) sentences, not propositions, are the relata of logical relations."

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text is that empiricism fails to adequately account for various phenomena, including meaning, emotions, and properties, leading to implausible views and damaging the foundations of psychology.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Empiricism's Inability to Accommodate Non-Spatiotemporal Entities**:
   - Empiricism's denial of non-spatiotemporal entities forces it to conventionalize and subjectivize arithmetical truth, leading to an inadequate understanding of meaning and properties.
   - This argument is supported by the claim that empiricists cannot explain the convention-based nature of meaning without reducing it entirely to convention.

2. **Mischaracterization of Relations as Properties**:
   - Empiricism often treats relations as properties and 3-place relations as 2-place relations, leading to a misunderstanding of phenomena like colors and emotions.
   - This mischaracterization results in the subjectivization of colors, tastes, and fragrances, which the text argues is implausible.

3. **Failure to Spatiotemporalize Meaning**:
   - Empiricists' attempts to spatiotemporalize meaning, such as Wittgenstein's view that "meaning is use," fail because meanings are identical with sets of properties, which cannot be reduced to spatiotemporal entities.
   - The text argues that if meaning were merely use, linguistic activity could occur without sentient life, which is absurd.

4. **Empiricism's Impact on Psychology**:
   - Empiricism-based methodologies have damaged psychology by reducing complex phenomena like emotions to mere sentiments, leading to a crude and sterile understanding of these phenomena.
   - The text suggests that successful branches of psychology make assumptions that are hard to justify within an empiricist framework.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Colors as Three-Place Relations**:
   - Colors are not two-place relations between the perceiver and the object but properties of three-place relations, challenging the empiricist view of colors as purely subjective.

2. **Emotions and Sentiments**:
   - The text argues that empiricism's categorization of emotions as non-cognitive sentiments is incorrect and fails to capture the complexity of emotional experiences.

3. **Scientization of Psychology**:
   - While attempts to scientize psychology have often been empiricist, some non-empiricist approaches (e.g., Freud, Chomsky) have been more successful, suggesting that empiricism is not necessary for scientific psychology.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Realism About Non-Spatiotemporal Entities**: The text assumes that non-spatiotemporal entities, such as meanings and properties, exist and are crucial for understanding various phenomena.
2. **Complexity of Mental States**: There is an assumption that mental states, including emotions and perceptions, are more complex than empiricism allows.
3. **Importance of Non-Empirical Methods**: The text implicitly assumes that non-empirical methods are necessary for understanding certain aspects of psychology and philosophy of mind.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's argument follows a deductive structure, starting with premises about the nature of empiricism and its limitations, leading to conclusions about its inadequacy in various domains. The argument is organized into sections that build upon each other, with each section providing evidence and reasoning to support the overall thesis.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: The text's core thesis is that linguistic competence is constitutively related to cognitive competence, meaning that cognitive processes inherently require linguistic vehicles.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The text also posits that subpersonal thought, which is unconscious and underlies conscious cognition, is a necessary component of cognitive processes, including those involved in perception and language comprehension.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Constitutive Relationship Between Linguistic and Cognitive Competence**:
   - The text argues that linguistic competence is not merely a precursor to cognitive competence but a fundamental component of it. This is illustrated by the example of Adam Smith, whose cognitive processes are suggested to require linguistic vehicles.
   - The argument is supported by the claim that it is a conceptual necessity for cognitive processes to involve linguistic elements, not just an idiosyncrasy of human psychology.

2. **Necessity of Subpersonal Thought**:
   - The text asserts that subpersonal thought, which is unconscious and underlies conscious cognition, is essential for cognitive operations such as vision, language comprehension, and musical ability.
   - This argument is bolstered by the claim that it would be regressive to suggest that the self carries out these operations, as it would require pre-existing perceptual abilities.

3. **Rejection of Empiricism**:
   - The text argues against empiricism by rejecting the notion that cognitive processes can be fully explained by sensory experience alone.
   - It supports this by invoking the concept of subpersonal thought, which is not directly accessible through sensory experience.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Perception and Conceptual Knowledge**:
   - The text suggests that perception involves a conceptual dimension, with articulated sensations corresponding to conceptual knowledge.
   - This claim supports the broader argument that cognitive processes are more complex than mere sensory input and require conceptual frameworks.

2. **Phenomenology and Subpersonal Thought**:
   - The text argues that different kinds of subpersonal ideation are associated with different kinds of phenomenology, and that these associations can indicate the correctness or validity of the thoughts.
   - This claim reinforces the necessity of subpersonal thought in cognitive processes and its role in shaping our perceptual experiences.

3. **Universals and Linguistic Symbols**:
   - The text posits that while we grasp universals through linguistic symbols, our minds can also grasp them non-linguistically, which is necessary for linguistic expressions to have meaning.
   - This claim supports the broader argument that cognitive processes involve both linguistic and non-linguistic elements.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Innate Cognitive Structures**: The text assumes that certain cognitive structures are innate and not solely derived from sensory experience, aligning with rationalist perspectives.

2. **Modularity of Mind**: The discussion of subpersonal thought suggests an assumption of modularity, where different cognitive functions are handled by distinct, specialized systems.

3. **Non-Reductive Approach to Mind**: The text assumes a non-reductive approach to the mind, rejecting the idea that cognitive processes can be fully explained by breaking them down into simpler components.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premises**:
   - Linguistic competence is constitutively related to cognitive competence.
   - Subpersonal thought is necessary for cognitive operations.
   - Empiricism cannot fully explain cognitive processes.

2. **Intermediate Conclusions**:
   - Cognitive processes require linguistic vehicles.
   - Subpersonal thought underlies conscious cognition.
   - Perception involves conceptual knowledge.

3. **Final Conclusion**: Cognitive competence inherently involves linguistic elements and subpersonal thought, which cannot be fully explained by empiricism.
