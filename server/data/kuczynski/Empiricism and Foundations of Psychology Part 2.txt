## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

The core thesis of the text can be formulated as follows:

- **Primary Formulation**: A sentence is meaningful if and only if it attributes some property to some object.
- **Secondary Formulation**: Sentences that appear meaningless due to undefined terms can become meaningful once those terms are defined.
- **Tertiary Formulation**: Logical paradoxes, such as those identified by Russell and Tarski, do not constitute genuine examples of meaningless sentences but rather involve either false statements or sentence-schemata.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Meaning as Property Attribution**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that the meaning of a sentence is determined by its ability to attribute a property to an object. This is supported by the claim that any sentence S can be reduced to the form "x has phi," where x is an object and phi is a property.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text provides examples such as "x is tall," which becomes meaningful once "x" is assigned a referent.

2. **Argument 2: Undefined Terms and Meaninglessness**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that sentences appear meaningless when they contain undefined terms. Once these terms are defined, the sentences become meaningful.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of "The absolute is one" is used to illustrate this point. The text argues that if "the absolute" is defined as the universe and "one" as self-identical, the sentence becomes meaningful.

3. **Argument 3: Logical Paradoxes and Meaninglessness**
   - **Explanation**: The text challenges the view that logical paradoxes, such as Russell's paradox, demonstrate the existence of meaningless sentences. Instead, it argues that these paradoxes involve either false statements or sentence-schemata.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text discusses Russell's paradox and argues that the problematic expressions are either false or sentence-schemata, not actual sentences.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Sentence-Schemata vs. Sentences**
   - **Explanation**: The text distinguishes between sentences and sentence-schemata, arguing that sentence-schemata are expressions with variables that become meaningful sentences once the variables are assigned referents.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of "x is tall" is used to illustrate the concept of a sentence-schema.

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Circular Definitions in Set Theory**
   - **Explanation**: The text critiques the circularity in definitions related to set theory, particularly in the context of Russell's paradox.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text discusses the class K of all classes that are not members of themselves and argues that the definition of "itself" in this context is circular.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Reductionism in Semantics**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that all meaningful sentences can be reduced to a form that attributes a property to an object. This assumption underlies the primary argument about the nature of meaning.

2. **Assumption 2: Referential Theory of Meaning**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes a referential theory of meaning, where the meaning of a sentence is determined by the objects and properties it refers to. This assumption is evident in the emphasis on defining terms to make sentences meaningful.

3. **Assumption 3: Logical Consistency as a Criterion for Meaningfulness**
   - **Explanation**: The text assumes that meaningful sentences must be logically consistent and not violate the Law of Non-Contradiction. This assumption is used to critique the view that logical paradoxes demonstrate the existence of meaningless sentences.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

The text's overall argument can be broken down into the following logical structure:

1. **Premise 1**: Any given sentence S is equivalent to some sentence having the form "x has phi."
2. **Premise 2**: A sentence is meaningful if it attributes some property to some object.
3. **Premise 3**: Sentences with undefined terms appear meaningless but become meaningful once those terms are defined.
4. **Premise 4**: Logical paradoxes do not demonstrate the existence of meaningless sentences but involve either false statements or sentence-schemata.
5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the meaning of a sentence is determined by its ability to attribute a property to an object, and apparent meaninglessness can be resolved by defining terms or recognizing the nature of logical paradoxes.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction of Core Thesis**: The text begins by introducing the core thesis that a sentence is meaningful if it attributes a property to an object.
2. **Exploration of Undefined Terms**: The text then explores the role of undefined terms in apparent meaninglessness, using examples like "The absolute is one" to illustrate how defining terms can render sentences meaningful.
3. **Critique of Logical Paradoxes**: The text shifts to a critique of logical paradoxes, arguing that they do not demonstrate the existence of meaningless sentences but involve either false statements or sentence-schemata.

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: The expression "the property of being the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" does not refer to any property, and thus, Russell's Paradox does not provide a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
   - This thesis challenges the traditional interpretation of Russell's Paradox and its implications for set theory.

2. **Secondary Formulation**: The occurrence of "itself" in the expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" lacks a sense, rendering the expression meaningless and incapable of encoding a proposition.
   - This formulation focuses on the semantic properties of the expression and its inability to refer to a coherent concept.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Lack of Reference**
   - The expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not refer to anything, as demonstrated by the failure of "itself" to pick out a referent.
   - This argument is supported by the analogy to the expression "the man whose best friend that woman is," which also fails to have a sense if "that woman" does not refer to anyone.

2. **Argument 2: Semantic Incoherence**
   - Even if the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" were to have a sense, it would still fail to pick out a property, as the concept of a set that is a member of itself is self-contradictory.
   - This argument is supported by the analysis of the expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves," which leads to a logical paradox when considered as a set.

3. **Argument 3: Propositional Failure**
   - The expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" fails to encode a proposition, as it does not express a coherent condition that could be satisfied by any object.
   - This argument is supported by the comparison to quantified generalizations, which express propositions by specifying conditions that can be satisfied by objects.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: Anaphoric Nature of "Itself"**
   - The occurrence of "itself" in the expression functions anaphorically, but it fails to refer to any antecedent, rendering the expression meaningless.
   - This claim is supported by the analysis of anaphoric terms and their dependence on a clear referent.

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: Irrelevance of Propositional Attitudes**
   - The occurrence of "itself" in the expression does not fall within the scope of any intensional operator, such as "believes," making the example of Larry's belief about himself irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox.
   - This claim is supported by the distinction between extensional and intensional contexts and their impact on the interpretation of self-reference.

3. **Subsidiary Claim 3: Self-Defeating Nature of TT**
   - The principle TT (Tarski's Truth), which states that no meaningful sentence concerns every sentence, is self-defeating because it is given by a sentence that violates its own stricture.
   - This claim is supported by the analysis of the sentence expressing TT and its failure to adhere to its own principle.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: Semantic Realism**
   - The text assumes a realist view of semantics, where expressions have meaning by virtue of referring to objects or properties in the world.
   - This assumption underlies the argument that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" fails to refer to any property.

2. **Assumption 2: Logical Consistency**
   - The text assumes that a coherent logical system should not contain contradictions or paradoxes.
   - This assumption underlies the argument that Russell's Paradox, if it were a genuine counterexample, would undermine the consistency of set theory.

3. **Assumption 3: Propositional Content**
   - The text assumes that meaningful sentences must encode propositions, which are truth-evaluable and express conditions that can be satisfied by objects.
   - This assumption underlies the argument that the expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" fails to encode a proposition.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1**: The expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not refer to anything.
2. **Premise 2**: If an expression does not refer to anything, it does not encode a proposition.
3. **Premise 3**: If an expression does not encode a proposition, it cannot be a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the expression "the property of being the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" is not a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

### 2.6 Argument Progression and Development Throughout the Text

1. **Introduction of the Problem**: The text begins by posing the question of what property a thing must have to belong to K, and what "the property of being a member of K" refers to.
2. **Analysis of the Expression**: The text then analyzes the expression "the property of not being a member of itself," arguing that it fails to refer to any property.
3. **Implications for Propositions**: The text extends this analysis to argue that the expression fails to encode a proposition, as it does not express a coherent condition.
4. **Comparison to Other Expressions**: The text draws analogies to other expressions, such as "the man whose best friend that woman is," to support its claim about the lack of sense in the expression.
5. **Critique of Objections**: The text anticipates and responds to potential objections, such as the claim that the expression could have a sense if interpreted differently.
6. **Extension to Russell's Paradox**: The text applies its analysis to Russell's Paradox, arguing that the paradox does not provide a genuine counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears at the beginning of the text, as the initial expression under analysis.
   - **Significance**: This quotation represents the core concept that the text aims to critique and deconstruct. It is the expression that the author argues fails to refer to any property, which is central to the overall thesis.

2. **Quotation 2**: "if the expression 'the property of not being a member of itself' doesn't refer to anything, then we have made our case: we have shown that we don't have in Ki K a proposition-bearing sentence, let alone a true one, and that we therefore don't have in K a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears early in the text, as part of the initial argument against the expression's referential capacity.
   - **Significance**: This quotation encapsulates the primary argument that the lack of reference in the expression undermines its ability to encode a proposition or serve as a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

3. **Quotation 3**: "the 'the property of not being a member of itself' does not have a sense; it just appears to have a sense, however paradoxical this may sound."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text transitions from discussing the expression's lack of reference to its lack of sense.
   - **Significance**: This quotation highlights the text's claim that the expression not only fails to refer but also lacks any coherent meaning, which is a crucial step in the argument against its propositional content.

4. **Quotation 4**: "K1 is equivalent (though not necessarily synonymous) with: Kis: 'There exists something that is uniquely a set of all sets that aren't members of themselves; moreover, that thing is a member of itself.'"
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text introduces the concept of K1 and its equivalence to Kis.
   - **Significance**: This quotation provides a formal definition of the paradoxical set that the text aims to critique, and it sets the stage for the subsequent analysis of its semantic properties.

5. **Quotation 5**: "the occurrence of 'itself' doesn't refer to anything, a consequence being that K1 fails to encode a proposition."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text discusses the specific role of "itself" in the expression K1.
   - **Significance**: This quotation is crucial in establishing the link between the lack of reference in "itself" and the failure of K1 to encode a proposition, which is a key step in the overall argument.

6. **Quotation 6**: "The expression 'the man whose best friend that woman is' does not have a sense unless the occurrence of 'that woman' picks someone out."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text introduces an analogy to support its claim about the lack of sense in the expression under analysis.
   - **Significance**: This quotation serves as a key example to illustrate the text's point about the dependence of expressions on their referential components, which is central to the argument against the expression's meaningfulness.

7. **Quotation 7**: "'the man whose best friend that woman is' thus no more has a sense than 'x is even' expresses a proposition."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text extends its analogy to further support its claim about the lack of sense in the expression.
   - **Significance**: This quotation strengthens the text's argument by drawing a parallel between the expression under analysis and a clearly non-propositional statement, reinforcing the claim that the expression lacks a sense.

8. **Quotation 8**: "the occurrence of 'itself' in Kı lacks a sense, and so does the corresponding occurrence in Kis."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text applies its analysis of the lack of sense in "itself" to both K1 and Kis.
   - **Significance**: This quotation is crucial in extending the text's argument to cover both versions of the paradoxical set, solidifying the claim that neither expression encodes a proposition.

9. **Quotation 9**: "'the property of being the set of sets that aren't members of themselves' picks nothing out, and that property, being non-existent, isn't a counter-example to the Axiom of Comprehension or, indeed, to any proposition."
   - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text summarizes its main points and draws its final conclusion.
   - **Significance**: This quotation encapsulates the text's central thesis that the expression under analysis does not refer to any property and thus cannot serve as a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension or any other proposition.

10. **Quotation 10**: "The rules of English semantics are not at fault here. Those rules are unambiguous as to how anaphoric terms are to be interpreted."
    - **Location/Context**: This quotation appears as the text addresses potential objections to its argument, specifically those related to the interpretation of anaphoric terms.
    - **Significance**: This quotation is important in preempting potential criticisms of the text's analysis, by clarifying that the issue lies not with the rules of semantics but with the specific expression under analysis.

## SECTION 4: ANALYTICAL MOVES DEPLOYED

### 4.1 Conceptual Analysis and Distinctions Drawn

1. **Conceptual Analysis**: The text engages in a detailed analysis of the concept of "the property of not being a member of itself," breaking it down into its constituent parts and examining their semantic properties.
   - **Location**: Throughout the text, particularly in the initial sections where the expression is introduced and analyzed.
   - **Function**: This analysis is crucial in establishing the text's claim that the expression fails to refer to any property, which is the foundation of its overall argument.

2. **Distinction Between Sense and Reference**: The text draws a distinction between an expression having a sense (meaning) and having a reference (denoting an object or property).
   - **Location**: This distinction is introduced early in the text and is used throughout to argue that the expression under analysis lacks both sense and reference.
   - **Function**: This distinction is essential in the text's argument, as it allows the author to claim that the expression is not only referentially empty but also semantically incoherent.

3. **Distinction Between Extensional and Intensional Contexts**: The text distinguishes between extensional contexts, where expressions refer to objects directly, and intensional contexts, where expressions fall within the scope of operators like "believes" that affect their interpretation.
   - **Location**: This distinction is introduced in the section discussing the example of Larry's belief about himself as a pianist.
   - **Function**: This distinction is used to argue that the occurrence of "itself" in the expression under analysis functions extensionally, making the example of Larry irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox.

### 4.2 Argumentation Strategies

1. **Reductio ad Absurdum**: The text employs a reductio ad absurdum argument to show that if the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" were to have a sense, it would lead to a logical paradox.
   - **Location**: This strategy is used in the section where the text discusses the hypothetical case of the expression having a sense.
   - **Function**: This argument strengthens the text's case by demonstrating that the alternative to its thesis (that the expression has a sense) leads to an absurd conclusion, thus supporting the claim that the expression is meaningless.

2. **Modus Tollens**: The text uses a modus tollens argument to conclude that since the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not refer to anything, it cannot encode a proposition.
   - **Location**: This strategy is used in the initial sections where the text argues that the lack of reference in the expression undermines its propositional content.
   - **Function**: This argument is crucial in establishing the logical connection between the expression's lack of reference and its failure to encode a proposition, which is a key step in the overall argument.

### 4.3 Category Error Detection

1. **Category Error in Set Theory**: The text identifies a category error in the concept of a set that is a member of itself, arguing that this concept violates the fundamental principles of set theory.
   - **Location**: This error is discussed in the sections analyzing the paradoxical nature of the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves.
   - **Function**: This identification of a category error is central to the text's argument that the expression under analysis is semantically incoherent and cannot refer to a genuine property.

### 4.4 Counterfactual Reasoning

1. **Counterfactual Analysis of the Expression's Sense**: The text engages in counterfactual reasoning by considering what would happen if the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" were to have a sense.
   - **Location**: This reasoning is used in the section where the text discusses the hypothetical case of the expression having a sense.
   - **Function**: This counterfactual analysis strengthens the text's argument by showing that even if the expression were to have a sense, it would still fail to pick out a property, thus supporting the overall thesis.

### 4.5 Thought Experiments

1. **Thought Experiment with "The Man Whose Best Friend That Woman Is"**: The text uses a thought experiment involving the expression "the man whose best friend that woman is" to illustrate its point about the dependence of expressions on their referential components.
   - **Location**: This thought experiment is introduced in the section where the text draws an analogy to support its claim about the lack of sense in the expression under analysis.
   - **Function**: This thought experiment is crucial in making the text's argument more concrete and accessible, by providing a clear example of how an expression can fail to have a sense if its referential components are empty.

### 4.6 Analogies and Comparisons

1. **Analogy to "The Man Whose Best Friend That Woman Is"**: The text draws an analogy between the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" and the expression "the man whose best friend that woman is," arguing that both expressions fail to have a sense if their referential components are empty.
   - **Location**: This analogy is introduced in the section where the text discusses the lack of sense in the expression under analysis.
   - **Function**: This analogy is crucial in supporting the text's claim about the expression's lack of sense, by providing a parallel case that is more easily understood and accepted by the reader.

2. **Comparison to Quantified Generalizations**: The text compares the expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" to quantified generalizations, arguing that the former fails to encode a proposition while the latter does.
   - **Location**: This comparison is made in the section where the text discusses the propositional failure of the expression under analysis.
   - **Function**: This comparison is important in clarifying the text's point about the nature of propositions and how the expression under analysis fails to meet the criteria for encoding one.

### 4.7 Appeals to Intuition

1. **Appeal to Semantic Intuition**: The text appeals to the reader's semantic intuition by arguing that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" appears to have a sense but ultimately does not.
   - **Location**: This appeal is made throughout the text, particularly in the sections where the expression's lack of sense is discussed.
   - **Function**: This appeal to intuition is crucial in persuading the reader to accept the text's claim about the expression's semantic properties, by aligning it with their pre-theoretic understanding of meaning and reference.

### 4.8 Inference to Best Explanation

1. **Inference to Best Explanation of the Paradox**: The text uses an inference to the best explanation to argue that the most plausible explanation for Russell's Paradox is that the expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" fails to refer to any set.
   - **Location**: This inference is used in the sections where the text discusses the implications of its analysis for Russell's Paradox.
   - **Function**: This inference is important in providing a coherent and compelling explanation for the paradox, which supports the text's overall thesis about the expression's lack of reference and sense.

### 4.9 Transcendental Arguments

1. **Transcendental Argument for the Axiom of Comprehension**: The text employs a transcendental argument to claim that the Axiom of Comprehension must be true because any counterexample to it, such as Russell's Paradox, would be semantically incoherent.
   - **Location**: This argument is implicit throughout the text, particularly in the sections where the implications for the Axiom of Comprehension are discussed.
   - **Function**: This transcendental argument is crucial in establishing the text's claim about the nature of logical paradoxes and their inability to undermine fundamental principles like the Axiom of Comprehension.

### 4.10 Dialectical Moves

1. **Dialectical Engagement with Objections**: The text engages dialectically with potential objections to its argument, such as the claim that the expression could have a sense if interpreted differently.
   - **Location**: This engagement occurs in the sections where the text anticipates and responds to potential criticisms.
   - **Function**: This dialectical move is important in strengthening the text's argument by showing that it can withstand challenges and alternative interpretations, thus increasing its persuasive power.

### 4.11 Deconstructive Strategies

1. **Deconstruction of the Expression's Meaning**: The text employs a deconstructive strategy to show that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" appears to have a sense but ultimately does not, by breaking down its constituent parts and revealing their semantic incoherence.
   - **Location**: This strategy is used throughout the text, particularly in the sections where the expression's lack of sense is analyzed.
   - **Function**: This deconstructive approach is crucial in undermining the traditional interpretation of Russell's Paradox and supporting the text's claim about the expression's semantic properties.

### 4.12 Hermeneutical Approaches

1. **Hermeneutical Analysis of Anaphoric Terms**: The text engages in a hermeneutical analysis of anaphoric terms like "itself," examining their role in the expression under analysis and their dependence on a clear referent.
   - **Location**: This analysis is used in the sections where the text discusses the anaphoric nature of "itself" and its failure to refer.
   - **Function**: This hermeneutical approach is important in providing a detailed understanding of the semantic properties of the expression and supporting the text's claim about its lack of reference and sense.

## SECTION 5: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK & METHODOLOGY

### 5.1 Philosophical or Theoretical Commitments

1. **Semantic Realism**: The text is committed to a realist view of semantics, where expressions have meaning by virtue of referring to objects or properties in the world.
   - This commitment is evident in the text's focus on the referential properties of expressions and its claim that the expression under analysis fails to refer to any property.

2. **Logical Consistency**: The text is committed to the principle of logical consistency, arguing that a coherent logical system should not contain contradictions or paradoxes.
   - This commitment is reflected in the text's critique of Russell's Paradox and its claim that the paradox does not provide a genuine counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

3. **Propositional Content**: The text is committed to the view that meaningful sentences must encode propositions, which are truth-evaluable and express conditions that can be satisfied by objects.
   - This commitment is evident in the text's argument that the expression under analysis fails to encode a proposition and is thus meaningless.

### 5.2 Methodological Approach

1. **Analytical Philosophy**: The text employs an analytical approach, focusing on the precise analysis of logical and linguistic concepts and their implications for set theory and the foundations of mathematics.
   - This approach is evident in the text's detailed examination of the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" and its semantic properties.

2. **Formal Logic**: The text uses formal logical techniques, such as the analysis of logical paradoxes and the application of logical rules, to support its arguments.
   - This approach is reflected in the text's use of logical arguments like reductio ad absurdum and modus tollens to establish its claims about the expression's lack of reference and sense.

### 5.3 Epistemological Assumptions

1. **Semantic Knowledge**: The text assumes that we can have knowledge of the semantic properties of expressions, including their referential and propositional content.
   - This assumption underlies the text's claim that we can determine whether the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" refers to any property or encodes a proposition.

2. **Logical Certainty**: The text assumes that logical reasoning can provide certainty about the coherence and consistency of logical systems.
   - This assumption is evident in the text's confidence in its logical arguments against the expression's ability to serve as a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

### 5.4 Ontological Commitments

1. **Sets and Properties**: The text is committed to the existence of sets and properties as objects of reference, but it argues that the specific property under analysis (the property of not being a member of itself) does not exist.
   - This commitment is reflected in the text's discussion of set theory and its claim that the paradoxical set does not refer to any genuine set or property.

2. **Propositions**: The text is committed to the existence of propositions as truth-evaluable entities that can be encoded by meaningful sentences.
   - This commitment is evident in the text's argument that the expression under analysis fails to encode a proposition and is thus meaningless.

### 5.5 Use of Formal Logic or Informal Reasoning

1. **Formal Logic**: The text uses formal logical techniques, such as the analysis of logical paradoxes and the application of logical rules, to support its arguments.
   - Examples include the use of reductio ad absurdum and modus tollens to establish the expression's lack of reference and sense.

2. **Informal Reasoning**: The text also employs informal reasoning, such as analogies and thought experiments, to make its arguments more accessible and persuasive.
   - Examples include the analogy to "the man whose best friend that woman is" and the thought experiment involving Larry's belief about himself as a pianist.

### 5.6 Relationship to Empirical Evidence

1. **Lack of Empirical Evidence**: The text does not rely on empirical evidence to support its claims, as its arguments are based on logical and semantic analysis rather than empirical observation.
   - This lack of empirical evidence is consistent with the text's focus on the foundations of logic and mathematics, which are typically considered a priori disciplines.

## SECTION 6: INTELLECTUAL GENEALOGY

### 6.1 Thinkers and Theories Explicitly Referenced

1. **Bertrand Russell**: The text explicitly references Russell's Paradox, which is central to its analysis and critique.
   - Russell's Paradox, discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901, challenged the foundations of set theory and led to significant developments in logic and mathematics.

2. **Alfred Tarski**: The text mentions Tarski's Truth (TT) principle, which it argues is self-defeating.
   - Tarski's Truth principle states that no meaningful sentence concerns every sentence, and the text uses this principle to support its claim about the nature of logical paradoxes.

3. **John Perry**: The text references Perry's work on the nature of self-reference and propositional attitudes.
   - Perry's point about the difference between "Larry believes himself to be a great pianist" and "Larry believes Larry to be a great pianist" is used to argue that the example of Larry is irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox.

### 6.2 Implicit Influences and Philosophical Heritage

1. **Logical Positivism**: The text's focus on the meaningfulness of sentences and the nature of propositions aligns with the concerns of logical positivism, a philosophical movement prominent in the early to mid-20th century.
   - The discussion of whether certain expressions have a sense or reference echoes the logical positivists' interest in the verifiability of statements.

2. **Logical Atomism**: The text's engagement with Russell's work and the nature of propositions connects to the school of logical atomism, which Russell helped develop.
   - The discussion of whether certain expressions encode propositions relates to the atomistic view of language and reality.

   - The text's argument that Tarski's Truth principle is self-defeating engages with this canonical idea in the philosophy of language and logic.

## SECTION 7: CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS

### 7.1 Key Terms and Their Definitions

1. **Property**: The text uses the term "property" to refer to a characteristic or attribute that can be possessed by objects or sets.
   - The text argues that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not refer to any genuine property.

2. **Reference**: The text uses the term "reference" to denote the relationship between an expression and the object or property it picks out in the world.
   - The text claims that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" fails to refer to any property.

3. **Sense**: The text uses the term "sense" to refer to the meaning or semantic content of an expression, independent of its reference.
   - The text argues that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" lacks a sense, despite appearing to have one.

4. **Proposition**: The text uses the term "proposition" to refer to a truth-evaluable entity that can be encoded by a meaningful sentence.
   - The text claims that the expression "the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" fails to encode a proposition.

5. **Anaphoric Term**: The text uses the term "anaphoric term" to refer to a linguistic expression that refers back to a previously mentioned entity in the discourse.
   - The text argues that the occurrence of "itself" in the expression under analysis functions anaphorically but fails to refer to any antecedent.

### 7.2 Technical Vocabulary Introduced or Employed

1. **Axiom of Comprehension**: The text employs the technical term "Axiom of Comprehension" to refer to a fundamental principle in set theory that states that for any property, there exists a set containing all and only the objects that have that property.
   - The text argues that Russell's Paradox does not provide a counterexample to this axiom.

2. **Russell's Paradox**: The text employs the technical term "Russell's Paradox" to refer to the logical paradox discovered by Bertrand Russell, which arises from considering the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.
   - The text's central thesis is that this paradox does not provide a genuine counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

3. **Tarski's Truth (TT)**: The text employs the technical term "Tarski's Truth" to refer to the principle that no meaningful sentence concerns every sentence.
   - The text argues that this principle is self-defeating because it is given by a sentence that violates its own stricture.

### 7.3 Distinctions Drawn Between Related Concepts

1. **Sense vs. Reference**: The text draws a distinction between an expression having a sense (meaning) and having a reference (denoting an object or property).
   - This distinction is crucial in the text's argument that the expression under analysis lacks both sense and reference.

2. **Extensional vs. Intensional Contexts**: The text distinguishes between extensional contexts, where expressions refer to objects directly, and intensional contexts, where expressions fall within the scope of operators like "believes" that affect their interpretation.
   - This distinction is used to argue that the occurrence of "itself" in the expression under analysis functions extensionally, making the example of Larry irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox.

3. **Bound Variable vs. Anaphoric Device**: The text distinguishes between a pronoun functioning as a bound variable, which is eliminable in a straightforward way, and a pronoun functioning as an anaphoric device, which is not eliminable in the same way.
   - This distinction is used to argue that the occurrence of "itself" in the expression under analysis functions anaphorically and thus cannot be eliminated in a straightforward way.

### 7.4 Theoretical Innovations or Neologisms

1. **Semantic Incoherence**: The text introduces the concept of "semantic incoherence" to describe the failure of an expression to have a coherent meaning or reference.
   - This concept is used to argue that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" is semantically incoherent and thus cannot serve as a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

### 7.5 Repurposing of Existing Concepts

1. **Propositional Attitudes**: The text repurposes the concept of propositional attitudes, typically used in the philosophy of mind and language, to argue that the example of Larry's belief about himself as a pianist is irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox.
   - The text uses this concept to draw a distinction between extensional and intensional contexts and to argue that the occurrence of "itself" in the expression under analysis functions extensionally.

## SECTION 8: ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE

### 8.1 Overall Organization of the Argument

1. **Introduction of the Problem**: The text begins by posing the question of what property a thing must have to belong to K, and what "the property of being a member of K" refers to.
2. **Analysis of the Expression**: The text then analyzes the expression "the property of not being a member of itself," arguing that it fails to refer to any property.
3. **Implications for Propositions**: The text extends this analysis to argue that the expression fails to encode a proposition, as it does not express a coherent condition.
4. **Comparison to Other Expressions**: The text draws analogies to other expressions, such as "the man whose best friend that woman is," to support its claim about the lack of sense in the expression.
5. **Critique of Objections**: The text anticipates and responds to potential objections, such as the claim that the expression could have a sense if interpreted differently.
6. **Extension to Russell's Paradox**: The text applies its analysis to Russell's Paradox, arguing that the paradox does not provide a genuine counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
7. **Conclusion and Implications**: The text concludes by summarizing its main points and discussing the implications for the foundations of set theory and the nature of logical paradoxes.

### 8.2 Logical Dependencies Between Claims

1. **Claim 1**: The expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not refer to anything.
   - **Dependency**: This claim is the foundation of the text's argument, as it is used to support the subsequent claims about the expression's lack of sense and propositional content.

2. **Claim 2**: If an expression does not refer to anything, it does not encode a proposition.
   - **Dependency**: This claim depends on Claim 1, as it uses the lack of reference to argue for the lack of propositional content.

3. **Claim 3**: If an expression does not encode a proposition, it cannot be a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
   - **Dependency**: This claim depends on Claim 2, as it uses the lack of propositional content to argue against the expression's status as a counterexample.

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the expression "the property of being the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" is not a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
   - **Dependency**: This conclusion depends on all three claims, as it follows logically from the argument that the expression lacks reference, sense, and propositional content.

### 8.3 Progression from Premises to Conclusions

1. **Premise 1**: The expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not refer to anything.
2. **Premise 2**: If an expression does not refer to anything, it does not encode a proposition.
3. **Premise 3**: If an expression does not encode a proposition, it cannot be a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the expression "the property of being the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" is not a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.

### 8.4 Use of Examples, Illustrations, or Case Studies

1. **Example 1**: The text uses the example of the expression "the man whose best friend that woman is" to illustrate its point about the dependence of expressions on their referential components.
   - This example is used to support the claim that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" lacks a sense if its referential components are empty.

2. **Example 2**: The text uses the example of Larry's belief about himself as a pianist to illustrate the distinction between extensional and intensional contexts.
   - This example is used to argue that the occurrence of "itself" in the expression under analysis functions extensionally, making the example of Larry irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox.

### 8.5 Anticipation and Response to Objections

1. **Objection 1**: One might object that the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" could have a sense if interpreted differently.
   - **Response**: The text responds to this objection by arguing that even if the expression were to have a sense, it would still fail to pick out a property, thus supporting the overall thesis.

2. **Objection 2**: One might object that the rules of English semantics are at fault for the expression's lack of sense.
   - **Response**: The text responds to this objection by clarifying that the rules of English semantics are unambiguous and that the issue lies with the specific expression under analysis, not with the rules themselves.

### 8.6 Dialectical Structure

1. **Thesis**: The expression "the property of being the set of all sets that aren't members of themselves" does not refer to any property and thus cannot serve as a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
2. **Antithesis**: The traditional interpretation of Russell's Paradox as a genuine counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
3. **Synthesis**: The text's detailed analysis and critique of the expression's semantic properties, which undermines the traditional interpretation and supports the thesis that the expression is not a counterexample.

### 9.3 Unstated Assumptions that Could be Challenged

1. **Assumption of Logical Consistency**: The text assumes that a coherent logical system should not contain contradictions or paradoxes.
   - This assumption could be challenged by philosophers who argue that logical systems can tolerate certain kinds of contradictions or paradoxes, such as dialetheists who accept true contradictions.

2. **Assumption of Propositional Content**: The text assumes that meaningful sentences must encode propositions, which are truth-evaluable and express conditions that can be satisfied by objects.
   - This assumption could be challenged by philosophers who argue that not all meaningful sentences encode propositions, such as those who accept non-propositional content in language.

### 9.4 Alternative Interpretations or Objections Not Addressed

1. **Alternative Semantic Theories**: The text does not address alternative semantic theories that might allow for self-reference or the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" to have a sense.

2. **Engagement with Tarski's Work**: The text engages with Alfred Tarski's work on the nature of truth and logical paradoxes, particularly his Truth principle (TT) and its implications for the meaningfulness of sentences.
   - The text's argument that Tarski's Truth principle is self-defeating is a direct response to Tarski's own formulation of the principle and its role in the philosophy of language and logic.

3. **Engagement with Perry's Work**: The text engages with John Perry's work on the nature of self-reference and propositional attitudes, particularly his analysis of the difference between "Larry believes himself to be a great pianist" and "Larry believes Larry to be a great pianist."
   - The text's use of Perry's point to argue that the example of Larry is irrelevant to the critique of Russell's Paradox is a direct response to Perry's own analysis of self-reference and its implications for semantic theories.

### 12.3 Position within Broader Scholarly Conversations

1. **Contribution to the Philosophy of Logic**: The text contributes to the broader scholarly conversation in the philosophy of logic, particularly the ongoing debate about the nature of logical paradoxes and their implications for the foundations of set theory and mathematics.
   - The text's critique of Russell's Paradox as semantically incoherent and its argument that it is not a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension add a new perspective to this conversation and challenge existing views on the paradox.

2. **Contribution to the Philosophy of Language**: The text contributes to the broader scholarly conversation in the philosophy of language, particularly the ongoing debate about the nature of meaning and reference in language.
   - The text's analysis of the expression "the property of not being a member of itself" and its claim that it lacks both sense and reference add a new case study to this conversation and challenge existing semantic theories that allow for self-reference.

3. **Contribution to the Foundations of Mathematics**: The text contributes to the broader scholarly conversation on the foundations of mathematics, particularly the role of set theory and the Axiom of Comprehension in providing a secure foundation for mathematical reasoning.
   - The text's argument that Russell's Paradox does not undermine the Axiom of Comprehension adds a new perspective to this conversation and strengthens the case for the security of the foundations of set theory and mathematics.
