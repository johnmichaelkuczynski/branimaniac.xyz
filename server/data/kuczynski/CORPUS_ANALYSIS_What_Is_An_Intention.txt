## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: Intentions are judgments as to how to consolidate one's psychological architecture, and values are beliefs as to what, in general, is conducive to the integrity of one's psychological architecture.
2. **Secondary Formulation**: Freedom is understood in terms of aligning one's actions with second-order desires, which are driven by rational appraisals of one's situation.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Intentions as System-Level Judgments**:
   - The text argues that intentions are not mere desires but are judgments about how to maintain or enhance one's psychological coherence. This is supported by the claim that intentions guide actions in a way that preserves the integrity of one's mental state.

2. **Values as System-Level Beliefs**:
   - Values are described as beliefs about what generally supports the integrity of one's psychological architecture. This argument is developed through the assertion that values guide actions in a way that aligns with one's overall psychological well-being.

3. **Freedom and Second-Order Desires**:
   - The text adopts Frankfurt's analysis that freedom is a matter of aligning one's actions with second-order desires. This is supported by the example of Jones, the heroin-addicted writer, who is free when he acts according to his second-order desire not to take heroin.

4. **Rationality and Freedom**:
   - The text argues that freedom is tied to rationality, as rational appraisals drive second-order desires. This is illustrated by Jones' rational decision to endure discomfort for the sake of his writing career.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Minds vs. Selves**:
   - The text posits that minds and selves are distinct, with selves requiring a higher degree of psychological integration and agency. This is a subsidiary claim that supports the main thesis by clarifying the nature of psychological architecture.

2. **Values and Agency**:
   - Values are linked to the consolidation of agency, suggesting that what is valuable is what enhances one's ability to act freely and coherently. This claim supports the idea that values are system-level beliefs.

3. **Critique of Frankfurt's Analysis**:
   - The text critiques Frankfurt's analysis of freedom, arguing that second-order desires can be manipulated by first-order desires, leading to a false sense of freedom. This critique is used to refine the understanding of freedom and its relation to intentions and values.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

## SECTION 2: MAIN THESIS & CENTRAL ARGUMENTS

### 2.1 Core Thesis Statement

1. **Primary Formulation**: Rational conduct is driven by second-order desires, which reflect a person's true self and long-term interests, distinguishing it from intelligent but irrational conduct driven by first-order desires.
2. **Secondary Formulation**: Freedom is not merely the ability to act on desires but requires that those desires reflect one's true self, thereby avoiding alienation from one's mental states.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Self-Consciousness and Rationality**: The text argues that persons are distinguished by their self-consciousness and ability to rationally assess their desires. This is supported by the claim that non-persons, like beavers, do not question their desires but act on them directly.
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that self-consciousness enables persons to critically evaluate their desires, which is a prerequisite for rational conduct. This is contrasted with non-persons who lack this capacity.

2. **Second-Order Desires and Rationality**: The text asserts that rational conduct is driven by second-order desires, which are desires about desires. This is supported by the argument that acting on first-order desires neglects one's second-order desires and long-term interests.
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that second-order desires are more closely aligned with one's long-term welfare and values, making them a more rational basis for action than immediate first-order desires.

3. **Distinction Between Rational and Intelligent Conduct**: The text distinguishes between rational and intelligent conduct, arguing that an act can be highly intelligent yet irrational if it does not consider one's overall interests.
   - **Explanation**: The example of Smith building a robot to impress his wife illustrates that intelligence in execution does not equate to rationality if the act fails to consider relevant facts and consequences.

4. **Freedom and True Self**: The text argues that true freedom requires desires to reflect one's true self, preventing alienation from one's mental states.
   - **Explanation**: The text suggests that freedom is not just about acting on desires but ensuring those desires are aligned with one's authentic self, drawing an analogy to physical conditions like Parkinson's to emphasize the concept of alienation.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Rationality and Self-Restraint**: The text claims that too much self-restraint can be dysfunctional and inhibit creativity, suggesting that rational action sometimes involves acting on approved impulses.
   - **Explanation**: This argument supports the idea that rational conduct involves a balance between acting on second-order desires and allowing certain first-order desires to be expressed when they align with one's values.

2. **Voluntary and Involuntary Behavior**: The text distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary behavior, asserting that voluntary behavior is desire-driven and intentional.
   - **Explanation**: This claim supports the broader argument about freedom and rationality by clarifying the nature of actions and their relation to desires.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Hierarchical Model of Desires**: The text assumes a hierarchical model of desires, where second-order desires are more fundamental to one's identity and rationality than first-order desires.
2. **Rationality as a Normative Standard**: The text assumes that rationality is a normative standard for evaluating actions, implying that rational actions are preferable to irrational ones.
3. **Self-Consciousness as a Unique Human Trait**: The text assumes that self-consciousness is a unique trait of persons, distinguishing them from non-persons.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premises**: The text begins with premises about the nature of persons, self-consciousness, and rationality, establishing the foundation for the subsequent arguments.
2. **Development**: It then develops these premises into arguments about the distinction between rational and intelligent conduct, the role of second-order desires, and the nature of freedom.

1. **Primary Formulation**: The core thesis of the text is that true freedom is not determined by higher-order desires, as proposed by Harry Frankfurt, but by one's values.
2. **Secondary Formulation**: Freedom consists primarily in being oneself, and secondarily in being able to do what one wants, with the latter being a derivative of the former.

### 2.2 Primary Arguments Supporting the Thesis

1. **Argument 1: Critique of Frankfurt's Higher-Order Desires Theory**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that higher-order desires can be warped to fit first-order desires, thus not ensuring true freedom. This is illustrated through the example of a lazy, weak person who manipulates their higher-order desires to justify their first-order desires.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The text uses the example of a person who warps their higher-order desires to rubber-stamp their first-order desires, suggesting that such acts are not free.

2. **Argument 2: The Role of Values in Freedom**
   - **Explanation**: The text posits that true freedom is driven by values rather than desires. Values are distinct from desires and are the true drivers of free acts.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The narrative of a person who wants to enjoy opera to fit in with a certain social group, despite hating opera, illustrates that desires can be manipulated for social conformity, whereas values remain a more stable and authentic guide to action.

3. **Argument 3: The Relationship Between Personality Structures and Desires**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that desires are rooted in enduring personality structures, and the inability to express these desires leads to frustration, which is a form of unfreedom.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of Smith, whose addiction frustrates his pre-existing desires rooted in his personality structure, supports this argument.

4. **Argument 4: The Distinction Between Freedom and Desire Frustration**
   - **Explanation**: The text distinguishes between the loss of freedom and the frustration of desires, arguing that the former is the cause of the latter.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The case of Aaronson, who suppresses his personality structures to conform to societal expectations, leading to the frustration of his desires, illustrates this distinction.

### 2.3 Secondary Arguments and Subsidiary Claims

1. **Subsidiary Claim 1: The Nature of Desires and Feelings**
   - **Explanation**: The text claims that desires are structures rather than feelings, and the intensity of the feelings associated with a desire does not necessarily reflect the intensity of the desire itself.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The discussion of Smith's addiction and the phenomenological expression of frustration supports this claim.

2. **Subsidiary Claim 2: The Importance of Being Oneself**
   - **Explanation**: The text argues that being oneself is central to freedom, and that living according to others' expectations leads to a loss of freedom.
   - **Supporting Evidence**: The example of Aaronson, who lives a life dictated by others, leading to a 'waking death,' supports this claim.

### 2.4 Implicit Assumptions Underlying the Arguments

1. **Assumption 1: The Existence of a True Self**: The text assumes that there is a true self, distinct from the desires and actions influenced by external pressures.
2. **Assumption 2: The Stability of Values**: It assumes that values are more stable and authentic than desires, serving as a better guide to free action.
3. **Assumption 3: The Impact of Social Conformity**: The text assumes that societal pressures can significantly influence individual behavior and lead to a loss of freedom.

### 2.5 Logical Structure of the Overall Argument

1. **Premise 1**: Higher-order desires can be manipulated to fit first-order desires, thus not ensuring true freedom.
2. **Premise 2**: True freedom is driven by values, which are distinct from desires.
3. **Premise 3**: Desires are rooted in personality structures, and the inability to express these desires leads to frustration and unfreedom.
4. **Premise 4**: The loss of freedom is distinct from, and the cause of, the frustration of desires.
5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, true freedom consists primarily in being oneself (guided by values) and secondarily in being able to do what one wants (as a derivative of being oneself).
