POSITION STATEMENTS: KUCZYNSKI - INTENSIONALITY (SEMANTICS AND PRESEMANTICS)

================================================================================

CORE THESIS: EXTENSIONALITY AND THE SEMANTICS/PRESEMANTICS DISTINCTION

1. All contexts are extensional—intersubstituting co-referring terms always preserves truth-value.

2. Kripke's arguments for necessary a posteriori truths appear probative only so long as one fails to distinguish between semantics and presemantics.

3. The distinction between semantics and presemantics is between the literal meanings of sentences and the information on the basis of which one identifies those literal meanings.

4. The failure to distinguish between semantics and presemantics underlies the popular thesis that intersubstituting co-referring terms sometimes changes truth values.

5. Proper names are mere labels—they contribute only their referent to the proposition expressed.

6. The dramatic communicative differences between "Hesperus is Phosphorous" and "Hesperus is Hesperus" are not due to differences in literal meaning.

7. What a sentence communicates to somebody is not always confined to its literal meaning.

8. The existence-claims through which one accesses the meanings of sentences change over time.

================================================================================

DIRECT REFERENTIALISM

9. Direct referentialism readily explains why "Hesperus is Phosphorous" and "Hesperus is Hesperus" differ in respect of cognitive value.

10. Direct referentialism, if correct, is no threat to extensionality.

11. If direct referentialism is correct, sentences with co-referring terms coincide in respect of literal meaning and truth-value.

12. At the level of semantics, proper names merely label individuals without describing them.

13. The information through which one learns that a name labels something does describe it—this is presemantic, not semantic.

14. The proposition literally meant by "Smith is a great racquetball player" and "Bob is a great racquetball player" are identical if Smith is Bob.

15. Despite having the same literal meaning, such sentences may communicate entirely different propositions depending on presemantic knowledge.

================================================================================

DEFINITE DESCRIPTIONS

16. Russell's Theory of Descriptions states that sentences with "the phi" express quantified generalizations.

17. If Russell's Theory is correct, "the king of France" is not a referring term but a quantifier.

18. Direct referentialism has many of the virtues ascribed to the Theory of Descriptions.

19. Direct referentialism accounts for wide-scope and narrow-scope readings in terms of what utterances communicate.

20. The Theory of Descriptions cannot be preferred to referentialism on grounds that referentialism is inconsistent with facts about what is communicated.

21. Indirect referentialism (Frege's view that definite descriptions contribute senses) is semantically indistinguishable from Russellian quantification.

22. Indirect referentialism is merely a confused version of Russellianism.

23. There are no significant semantic differences between indirect reference and quantification.

24. Indirect referentialism, taken with compositionality, has extremely counterintuitive consequences.

25. Davidson argues cogently that Frege's view is inconsistent with the fact that languages are learnable.

================================================================================

PROPOSITIONS AND SENTENCE MEANING

26. A proposition is the non-linguistic entity meant by a complete sentence.

27. Sentence-tokens typically have propositions for their literal meanings (following Strawson, Kaplan, Salmon, Soames).

28. The function meant by a sentence-type can fail to assign a proposition to a particular token (presupposition failure).

29. Most sentence-types contain tense-markers, so the identity of the proposition depends on time of production.

30. What an occurrence of a sentence communicates depends on presemantic knowledge about how to assign referents to terms.

================================================================================

CONTEXTUALISM CRITIQUE

31. Contextualism holds that sentence-tokens require contextual facts to fill in semantic gaps.

32. Cappelen and Lepore have made an extremely strong case against contextualism.

33. Pinker has also made a strong case against contextualism.

34. Searle's thesis that literal meaning is relative to background assumptions is consistent with the argument of this paper.

35. One can, without dogmatism, hold that sentence-tokens as a rule do have truth-evaluable entities for their literal meanings.

================================================================================

PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES

36. The expression "that snow is white" refers to the proposition semantically encoded in "snow is white."

37. Belief ascriptions like "Fred believes that the inventor of bifocals snored" are extensional when properly analyzed.

38. Apparent substitution failures in belief contexts are explained by presemantic differences, not semantic ones.

39. The propositions believed are identical even when the sentences used to attribute beliefs differ in cognitive value.

40. What is communicated by a belief ascription depends on presemantic knowledge, not differences in literal meaning.

================================================================================

QUANTIFIERS AND REFERENCE

41. A quantifier is an expression that, embedded in a sentence, answers a question of the form "how many phi's are psi's?"

42. If a sentence S contains a definite description, S encodes a proposition answering a quantificational question.

43. Similarities between definite descriptions and other expressions are syntactic, not semantic.

44. The fact that meaningful sentences result from substituting names or descriptions is syntactic, not evidence of shared semantics.

45. "Some man" is semantically very different from any singular term, as Russell and Frege taught.

================================================================================

COGNITIVE VALUE AND COMMUNICATION

46. Sentences with the same literal meaning can have entirely different cognitive values.

47. Propositions communicated by sentences are not confined to their literal meanings.

48. The existence-claim used to access the meaning of a sentence necessarily changes over time.

49. Hearing a noise like "Bob" is one thing; knowing what it refers to is another.

50. To affix a name to the right person, background knowledge must be exploited—this is presemantic.
