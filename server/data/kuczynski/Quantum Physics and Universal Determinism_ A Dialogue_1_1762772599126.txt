Quantum 
Physics 
and 
Universal 
Determinism 


A 
Dialogue 


by 


J.-M. 
Kuczynski 
PhD 


Max: 
Professor, 
If 
Quantum 
Mechanics 
is 
correct, 
does 
it 
follow 
that 
the 
world 
is 
not 
deterministic? 


Dr. 
K: 
There 
are 
three 
different 
views 
as 
to 
how 
that 
question 
is 
to 
be 
answered. 
Let 
me 
state 
them, 
and 
I 
will 
let 
you 
decide 
which 
of 
those 
views, 
if 
any, 
is 
correct. 


Max: 
Agreed. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
conversation, 
we 
will 
henceforth 
assume 
that 
quantum 
mechanics 
is 
in 
fact 
correct. 


Max: 
Agreed. 


Dr. 
K: 
According 
to 
the 
first 
view, 
the 
world 
is 
completely 
deterministic. 
When 
we 
study 
the 
sub-atomic 
realm, 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
indeterministic. 
But 
this 
is 
because 
of 
the 
interference-effects 
generated 
by 
our 
attempts 
to 
study 
it. 


Max: 
What 
is 
an 
interference-effect? 


Dr. 
K: 
Whenever 
you 
examine 
something, 
you 
disturb 
it. 
In 
some 
cases, 
those 
disturbances 
are 
of 
negligible 
proportions 
and 
they 
don’t 
prevent 
us 
from 
learning 
about 
the 
thing 
we 
are 
studying. 
But 
sometimes 
such 
a 
disturbance 
is 
of 
non-negligible 
proportions 
and 
it 
therefore 
obscures 
the 
thing 
we 
are 
trying 
to 
learn 
about. 
A 
disturbance 
of 
the 
second 
kind 
is 
an 
interference-effect. 


Max: 
So 
an 
interference-effect 
is 
a 
disturbance, 
that 
is 
created 
by 
an 
attempt 
to 
learn 
about 
a 
given 
thing, 
that 
makes 
it 
difficult 
or 
even 
impossible 



to 
learn 
about 
that 
thing. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
Could 
you 
give 
an 
example. 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
am 
on 
a 
date 
with 
a 
girl. 
I 
want 
to 
know 
if 
she 
wants 
to 
have 
sex. 
In 
actuality, 
she 
does 
want 
to 
have 
sex, 
but 
I 
don’t 
know 
this. 
So 
I 
ask 
her, 
point 
blank, 
‘would 
you 
like 
to 
have 
sex?’ 
As 
a 
result, 
she 
is 
offended 
and 
shocked, 
and 
she 
no 
longer 
wants 
to 
have 
sex. 


Max: 
I 
see. 
So 
an 
interference-effect 
may 
actually 
alter 
the 
thing 
that 
we 
are 
studying? 


Dr. 
K: 
All 
interference-effects 
alter 
the 
thing 
being 
studied 
in 
some 
way 
or 
other. 
But 
they 
don’t 
always 
alter 
it 
in 
the 
relevant 
respect. 
Sometimes 
they 
do; 
sometimes 
they 
don’t. 


Max: 
I 
think 
I 
understand. 
Let’s 
suppose 
the 
girl 
likes 
you 
so 
much 
that 
she 
still 
wants 
to 
have 
sex 
with 
you, 
despite 
your 
question. 
In 
that 
case, 
your 
question 
didn’t 
change 
the 
girl’s 
mental 
state 
in 
the 
relevant 
way, 
even 
though 
it 
obviously 
did 
change 
it, 
at 
least 
temporarily. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
And 
this 
brings 
us 
to 
another 
point. 
Suppose 
that, 
after 
I 
ask 
the 
girl 
whether 
she 
wants 
to 
have 
sex, 
she 
does 
in 
fact 
want 
to 
have 
sex. 
For 
all 
I 
know, 
it 
could 
be 
that 
my 
question, 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
crudeness 
and 
directness, 
made 
her 
interested 
in 
me. 
Maybe 
she 
found 
me 
boring 
until 
I 
asked 
that 
question, 
at 
which 
point 
she 
detected 
a 
wild 
streak 
in 
me 
which 
sparked 
something 
in 
her. 
Since 
I 
don’t 
know 
how 
my 
question 
affected 
her, 
I 
don’t 
know 
what 
her 
mental 
state 
was 
before 
I 
asked 
her 
the 
question; 
so 
I 
don’t 
know 
what 
I 
originally 
wanted 
to 
know. 


Max: 
I 
see. 
Let’s 
suppose 
that 
you 
ask 
her 
the 
question 
at 
time 
t. 
When 
you 
asked 
that 
question, 
what 
you 
wanted 
to 
know 
was 
whether, 
up 
until 
t, 
she 
was 
interested 
in 
you. 
What 
you 
learn 
is 
how 
she 
feels 
about 
you 
after 
t, 
which 
is 
not 
what 
you 
were 
asking. 



Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
whatever 
those 
feelings 
are, 
it 
could 
be 
that 
prior 
to 
t 
she 
felt 
the 
opposite 
way, 
it 
being 
your 
question 
that 
changed 
her 
feelings. 


Max: 
I 
see. 
So, 
to 
change 
examples, 
if 
I 
want 
to 
know 
where 
somebody 
keeps 
his 
drugs, 
I 
can’t 
simply 
ask 
him 
point 
blank, 
since 
he 
is 
likely 
to 
get 
nervous 
and 
then 
put 
his 
drugs 
in 
a 
new 
place. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
It’s 
that 
interference-effects 
are 
a 
problem 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
learning 
about 
people’s 
minds. 
It’s 
less 
obvious 
how 
they 
prevent 
us 
from 
learning 
about 
other 
things. 
Could 
you 
give 
me 
an 
example? 


Dr. 
K: 
A 
doctor 
wants 
to 
know 
about 
the 
patient’s 
condition; 
so 
he 
performs 
exploratory 
surgery. 
As 
a 
result, 
he 
kills 
the 
patient. 


Max: 
Can 
you 
give 
me 
an 
example 
of 
an 
interference-effect 
that 
doesn’t 
involve 
organisms? 


Dr. 
K: 
You 
want 
to 
know 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
liquid 
in 
the 
beaker. 
So 
you 
insert 
a 
thermometer. 
The 
thermometer 
is 
much 
colder 
than 
the 
liquid. 
So 
you 
lower 
the 
liquid’s 
temperature 
when 
you 
try 
to 
measure 
it. 


Max: 
So 
the 
read-out 
on 
the 
thermometer 
isn’t 
accurate. 
It 
gives 
you 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
water 
after 
you 
tried 
to 
measure 
it, 
not 
before. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
But 
couldn’t 
you 
avoid 
this 
by 
making 
sure 
that 
your 
thermometer 
was 
the 
right 
temperature? 


Dr. 
K: 
But 
how 
would 
you 
know 
what 
the 
right 
temperature 
was? 


Max: 
Good 
point. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
how 
do 
you 
determine 
what 
the 
thermometer’s 
temperature 
is? 



Max: 
I 
see. 
If 
you 
use 
some 
other 
thermometric 
device, 
you’re 
likely 
to 
change 
the 
thermometer’s 
temperature. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
So 
how 
do 
ever 
learn 
the 
temperature 
of 
anything? 


Dr. 
K: 
We 
start 
with 
a 
multitude 
of 
approximate 
determinations 
of 
temperature. 
On 
that 
basis, 
we 
posit 
laws 
that 
are 
at 
least 
approximately 
correct. 
And 
on 
that 
basis, 
we 
are 
better 
able 
to 
measure 
an 
object’s 
temperature 
without 
significantly 
changing 
it. 


Max: 
And 
on 
that 
basis, 
in 
its 
turn, 
you 
posit 
laws 
that 
are 
more 
accurate 
than 
the 
ones 
you 
just 
posited, 
and 
you 
thereby 
further 
refine 
your 
thermometric 
techniques. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
Also, 
the 
more 
you 
know 
about 
the 
relevant 
physical 
laws, 
the 
better 
able 
you 
are 
to 
correctly 
interpret 
temperature-readings 
that 
are 
distorted 
by 
interactions 
between 
the 
thing 
whose 
temperature 
is 
measured 
and 
the 
instrument 
used 
to 
measure 
it. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
So 
how 
exactly 
does 
this 
bear 
on 
quantum 
physics? 


Dr. 
K: 
To 
learn 
about 
sub-atomic 
particles, 
we 
must 
bombard 
them 
with 
particles 
whose 
momenta 
are 
comparable. 
As 
a 
result, 
we 
displace 
the 
particles 
we 
are 
trying 
to 
learn 
about. 


Max: 
I 
see. 


Dr. 
K: 
We 
don’t 
know 
much 
of 
anything 
about 
sub-atomic 
particles 
unless 
we 
know 
the 
laws 
governing 
their 
motions. 



Max: 
I 
follow. 


Dr. 
K: 
We 
don’t 
know 
how 
about 
a 
given 
thing’s 
state 
of 
motion 
unless 
we 
know, 
for 
some 
time 
t1 
and 
some 
later 
time 
t2, 
where 
that 
thing 
is 
located 


at 
t1 
and 
where 
it 
is 
located 
at 
t2. 


Max: 
I 
understand. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
if 
that 
thing 
is 
a 
sub-atomic 
particle, 
any 
attempt 
to 
determine 


where 
it 
is 
at 
t1 
changes 
its 
location, 
the 
same 
therefore 
being 
true 
of 
its 
location 
at 
t2. 


Max: 
So 
we 
where 
don’t 
know 
where 
that 
particle 
is 
at 
either 
time. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 


Max: 
So 
we 
don’t 
know 
how 
it 
moved 
during 
that 
time-interval. 


Dr. 
K: 
Correct. 


Max: 
But 
surely 
we 
must 
know 
something 
about 
that 
particle. 
We 
know 
that 
it 
exists, 
for 
one 
thing. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 


Max: 
And 
we 
couldn’t 
know 
that 
without 
having 
any 
information 
as 
to 
its 
location. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
We 
may 
not 
with 
precision 
where 
it 
is 
located 
at 
any 
instant. 
But, 
when 
given 
a 
reasonably 
long 
time-interval, 
we 
must 
have 
at 
least 
at 
least 
a 
rough 
idea 
how 
its 
location 
at 
the 
end 
of 
that 
interval 
differs 
from 
its 
location 
at 
the 
beginning. 


Max: 
And 
we 
must 
therefore 
have 
a 
rough 
idea 
of 
that 
path 
it 
following 
during 
that 
interverval. 


Dr. 
And 
also 
of 
its 
location 
at 
the 
beginning 
and 
end 
of 
that 
journey. 



Max: 
Which 
means 
that 
we 
know 
something 
about 
the 
nature 
and 
magnitude 
of 
the 
disturbances 
created 
by 
our 
attempts 
to 
study 
those 
particles. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 


Max: 
So 
what 
can 
we 
know 
about 
a 
given 
particle? 


Dr. 
K: 
We 
can 
have 
approximate 
knowledge 
of 
its 
position 
at 
a 
given 


time. 


Max: 
Ok. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
we 
have 
approximate 
knowledge 
of 
its 
momentum 
at 
a 
given 


time. 


. 


Max: 
Ok. 


Dr. 
K: 
But 
we 
cannot 
simultaneously 
have 
approximate 
knowledge 
of 
both 
its 
position 
and 
its 
momentum 
at 
a 
given 
time. 


Max: 
So 
that’s 
the 
rub. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
the 
more 
precise 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
one, 
the 
less 
precise 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
other. 


Max: 
Intuitively, 
that 
makes 
sense. 


Dr. 
K: 
Explain. 


Max: 
Suppose 
that 
some 
car 
travels 
a 
very 
long 
distance. 
In 
that 
case, 
I 
can 
know, 
with 
a 
relatively 
high 
degree 
of 
precision, 
how 
long 
it 
took 
that 
car 
to 
make 
that 
journey, 
even 
if 
I 
have 
only 
a 
very 
rough 
knowledge 
of 
what 
its 
starting 
and 
ending 
points 
were. 



Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
If 
you 
know 
that 
the 
car 
went 
from 
New 
York 
to 
Los 
Angeles, 
and 
it 
did 
so 
in 
two 
days, 
you 
know 
a 
great 
deal 
about 
its 
state 
of 
motion 
during 
that 
period, 
even 
if 
you 
have 
no 
idea 
where 
exactly 
it 
started 
or 
where 
exactly 
it 
ended. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
the 
same 
principles 
hold 
of 
micro-particles. 
If 
you 
have 
vague 
knowledge 
of 
such 
a 
particle’s 
location 
at 
one 
time 
and 
vague 
knowledge 
of 
its 
location 
at 
some 
other 
time, 
you 
have 
relatively 
precise 
knowledge 
of 
its 
state 
of 
motion 
during 
that 
interval, 
provided 
that 
those 
two 
times 
are 
far 
enough 
enough 
apart. 


Max: 
The 
further 
apart, 
the 
more 
precise. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
Let 
t1 
be 
some 
moment 
in 
time; 
let 
t3 
be 
some 
later 
moment 
in 
time; 
and 
let 
t2 
be 
some 
intermediate 
moment 


Max: 
Ok. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
supposing 
that 
during 
the 
interval 
from 
t1 
to 
t3, 
car 
A 
is 
stationary 
and 
Car 
B 
is 
travelling 
very 
fast. 


Max: 
Ok. 


Dr. 
K: 
Which 
of 
the 
following 
two 
questions 
is 
easier 
to 
answer? 
Question 
number 
1: 
what 
is 
car 
A’s 
location 
at 
t2? 
Question 
number 
2: 
What 
is 
car 
B’s 
location 
at 
t2? 


Max: 
Obviously 
the 
first 
question 
is 
easier 
to 
answer. 
If 
car 
B 
is 
moving 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
1000 
mph, 
I 
am 
going 
to 
have 
a 
very 
hard 
time 
determining 
its 
exactly 
location 
at 
any 
given 
instant. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 


Max: 
If 
I 
look 
at 
it 
from 
far 
enough 
away---so 
that 
I 
see 
a 
large 
enough 



segment 
of 
its 
trajectory---then 
I 
know 
where 
it 
was 
during 
the 
corresponding 
interval. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
right. 


Max: 
As 
for 
car 
A, 
since 
it 
is 
stationary, 
there 
is 
no 
difference 
between 
looking 
at 
it 
during 
a 
short 
interval 
and 
looking 
at 
it 
during 
a 
long 
interval. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
If 
I 
look 
at 
it 
for 
a 
short 
period 
of 
time, 
I 
am 
given 
the 
same 
information 
as 
to 
is 
location 
that 
would 
be 
if 
I 
looked 
at 
for 
long 
period 
of 
time. 


Max: 
And 
the 
more 
an 
object’s 
state 
of 
motion 
during 
some 
interval 
approximates 
to 
that 
of 
a 
stationary 
object, 
the 
less 
the 
shortness 
of 
that 
interval 
diminishes 
the 
precision 
with 
which 
I 
can 
know 
that 
object’s 
position 
at 
a 
given 
moment 
within 
that 
interval. 


Dr. 
K: 
What 
you 
said 
would 
be 
correct, 
but 
you 
left 
out 
one 
thing. 


Max: 
What’s 
that? 


Dr. 
K: 
Supose 
that 
B—the 
fast 
car---is 
a 
drone. 
There 
is 
nobody 
inside. 


Max: 
So 
if 
it 
crashes, 
nobody 
gets 
hurt. 
I 
think 
I 
see 
where 
you’re 
going. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
suppose 
you 
put 
an 
invisible 
brick 
wall 
on 
the 
road 
on 
which 


it’s 
travelling. 


Max: 
Ok. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
suppose 
you 
put 
an 
invisible 
brick 
wall 
on 
the 
road 
on 
which 


B 
is 
travelling. 


Max: 
In 
that 
case, 
you 
know 
where 
the 
car 
is 
at 
the 
instant 
at 
which 
it 
crashes 
into 
the 
wall. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 



Max: 
But 
since 
the 
wall 
arrested 
its 
motion, 
you 
don’t 
know 
how 
fast 
it 
was 
travelling 
just 
prior 
to 
that 
instant. 


Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 


Max: 
The 
precision 
with 
which 
you 
can 
know 
its 
location 
at 
a 
given 
time 
is 
inversely 
proportionaly 
to 
the 
precision 
with 
which 
you 
can 
know 
its 
state 
of 
motion 
at 
that 
time. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 


Max: 
And 
the 
same 
is 
true 
of 
a 
sub-atomic 
particle. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
But 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
car, 
there 
are 
indirect 
ways 
of 
determining 
its 


state 
of 
motion 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
impact. 


Dr. 
K: 
Such 
as? 


Max: 
You 
can 
know 
how 
it 
affected 
the 
wall, 
and 
you 
know 
about 
the 
subsequent 
ripple 
effects. 
You 
know 
how 
other 
cars 
were 
affected, 
and 
you 
also 
know 
how 
the 
trees 
by 
the 
side 
of 
the 
road 
were 
affect. 
In 
a 
word, 
you 
know 
how 
others 
things 
were 
displaced. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right, 
but 
we 
have 
such 
knowledge 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
we 
have 
precise 
knowledge 
of 
the 
states 
of 
motion 
of 
those 
other 
things. 
And 
in 
the 
sub-atomic 
realm, 
we 
don’t 
have 
such 
benchmarks. 


Max: 
I 
see. 


Dr. 
K: 
So 
the 
degree 
of 
precision 
with 
which 
a 
particle’s 
momentum 
at 
a 
given 
time 
can 
be 
known 
is 
inversely 
proportional 
the 
degree 
of 
precision 
with 
which 
its 
position 
at 
that 
time 
can 
be 
known. 


Max: 
And 
that 
is 
Heisenberg’s 
Uncertainty 
Principle, 
I 
presume. 



Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 
The 
more 
accurately 
position 
is 
known, 
the 
less 
accurately 
momentum 
is 
known. 


Max: 
And 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
we 
don’t 
know 
either 
with 
complete 
precision, 
a 
given 
particle’sn 
condition 
at 
a 
later 
time 
is 
unpredictable. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Dr. 
K: 
And 
therefore 
random. 


Max: 
And 
therefore 
seemingly 
uncaused. 


Dr. 
K: 
The 
operative 
word 
being 
‘seemingly.’ 


Max: 
Right. 
It’s 
only 
because 
we 
don’t 
know 
enough 
about 
the 
particle’s 
condition 
at 
t1 
that 
there 
is 
anything 
unpredictable 
about 
its 
condition 
at 
t2. 


Dr. 
K: 
That’s 
the 
idea. 
The 
indeterminism 
is 
epistemic, 
not 
objective. 


Max: 
What 
is 
wrong 
with 
that 
position? 


Dr. 
K: 
First 
of 
all, 
it 
has 
no 
operational 
significance. 
We 
have 
to 
work 
with 
the 
data 
we 
have, 
not 
the 
data 
that 
we 
want. 


Max: 
Not 
the 
data 
that, 
our 
a 
priori 
philosophical 
views 
being 
what 
they 
are, 
we 
would 
like 
to 
have. 
Is 
that 
idea? 


Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 


Max: 
I 
am 
underwhelmed. 


Dr. 
K: 
Taken 
by 
itself, 
it 
is 
a 
weak 
point, 
I 
will 
admit. 
But 
all 
things 
considered, 
it’s 
a 
strong 
point. 


Max: 
How 
do 
you 
mean? 



Dr. 
K: 
Attempts 
to 
determinize 
the 
sub-atomic 
realm, 
by 
positing 
hidden 
variables, 
all 
failed. 
And 
attempts 
to 
prove 
their 
impossibility, 
relative 
to 
the 
experimental 
data 
and 
to 
known 
physical 
laws, 
were 
relatively 
successful. 


Max: 
Relatively 
successful? 


Dr. 
K: 
Technically, 
it 
wasn’t 
ever 
proved 
that 
there 
no 
such 
hidden 
variables 
exist. 
But 
it 
was 
proved 
that, 
if 
they 
do 
exist, 
they 
are 
very 
unlikely, 
physical 
law 
being 
what 
it 
is, 
to 
be 
of 
explanatory 
significance. 


Max: 
So 
scientists 
began 
to 
have 
a 
change 
of 
heart, 
then. 


Dr. 
K: 
Right. 
They 
stopped 
trying 
to 
understand 
the 
subatomic 
realm 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
super-atomic 
realm 
and 
resigned 
themselves 
to 
understanding 
it 
on 
its 
own 
terms. 


Max: 
I 
see. 
So 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
sub-atomic 
realm 
is 
inherently 
indeterministic. 


Dr. 
K: 
Not 
exactly. 


Max: 
How 
do 
you 
mean? 


Dr. 
K: 
Among 
those 
who 
both 
understand 
and 
accept 
quantum 
physics, 
there 
are 
two 
views 
as 
to 
whether 
quantum 
physics 
is 
compatible 
with 
determinism. 


Max: 
Namely? 


Dr. 
K: 
The 
one 
view 
is 
the 
one 
you 
described. 
Within 
the 
limits 
set 
by 
the 
Uncertainty 
Principle, 
events 
in 
the 
quantum 
realm 
are 
uncaused. 


Max: 
And 
the 
other 
view? 


Dr. 
K: 
Before 
you 
can 
understand 
that 
view, 
there 
are 
a 
couple 
of 
general 
principles 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
deterministic 
systems 
that 
you 
must 
first 
understand. 



Max: 
Please 
tell 
me 
those 
principles. 


Dr. 
K: 
When 
we 
describe 
a 
system 
as 
‘deterministic’, 
what 
we 
mean 
is 
that 
it 
is 
deterministic 
in 
certain 
respects. 
Given 
a 
system 
composed 
of 
interacting 
billiard 
balls, 
that 
system 
is 
deterministic 
in 
the 
sense 
that, 
given 
the 
positions 
and 
momenta 
of 
the 
billiard 
balls 
at 
a 
given 
time 
t1, 
it 
is 
determined 
what 
their 
positions 
and 
momenta 
at 
later 
time 
t2 
will 
be. 
But 
given 
what 
the 
colors 
are 
of 
those 
billiard 
balls 
at 
time 
t1, 
it 
is 
not 
determined 
what 
their 
colors 
are 
at 
time 
t2. 


Max: 
So 
that 
system 
is 
deterministic 
with 
respect 
to 
certain 
variables, 
but 
not 
others. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
And 
the 
variables 
with 
which 
respect 
to 
which 
a 
given 
system 
is 
deterministic 
are 
its 
state-variables. 


Max: 
Because 
the 
values 
of 
those 
variables 
at 
a 
given 
time 
determine 
its 
state---or 
least 
the 
aspects 
thereof 
that 
interest 
us---at 
that 
time. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
If 
a 
system 
is 
deterministic, 
it 
is 
deterministic 
relative 
to 
a 
given 
set 
of 
state-variables. 


Max: 
And 
indeterministic 
with 
respect 
to 
some 
other 
choice 
of 
state-
variables. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
And 
if 
a 
system 
is 
indeterministic 
with 
respect 
to 
one 
set 
of 
state-
variables, 
it 
may 
be 
deterministic 
with 
respect 
to 
some 
other 
set 
of 
state-
variables. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
And 
there 
is 
some 
set 
of 
state 
variables 
with 
respect 
to 
which 
the 
sub-atomic 
realm 
is 
deterministic. 
Is 
that 
the 
idea? 



Dr. 
K: 
Yes. 


Max: 
Could 
you 
be 
more 
specific? 


Dr. 
K: 
Where 
subatomic 
particles 
are 
concerned, 
we 
don’t 
locations 
or 
momenta 
with 
certainty. 
So 
we 
shouldn’t 
take 
location 
and 
momentum 
as 
our 
state 
variables. 
But 
we 
do 
know 
probable 
locations 
and 
probable 
momenta 
with 
certainty. 
Given 
each 
possible 
location 
l, 
we 
know 
the 
probability 
of 
a 
given 
particle’s 
occupying 
l 
at 
a 
given 
time 
t; 
and 
given 
each 
possible 
momentum 
m, 
we 
know 
that 
the 
probability 
of 
its 
having 
m 
at 
t. 
And 
these 
facts, 
taken 
collectively, 
constitute 
what 
we 
might 
we 
refer 
as 
that 
particle’s 
‘probability-profile’ 
at 
t. 


Max: 
Is 
that 
the 
term 
that 
physicists 
actually 
use? 
Or 
did 
you 
just 
make 
it 
up? 


Dr. 
K: 
I 
just 
made 
it 
up. 


Max: 
It’s 
a 
good 
expression 
though. 
When 
you 
said 
it, 
something 
clicked, 
and 
I 
think 
I 
know 
how 
to 
finish 
what 
you 
were 
saying. 


Dr. 
K: 
Let 
me 
hear 
it. 


Max: 
Instead 
taking 
of 
positions 
and 
momenta 
as 
our 
state-variables, 
we 
take 
probability-profiles 
as 
our 
state-variables. 


Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 


Max: 
Given 
a 
system 
of 
sub-atomic 
particles, 
the 
probability 
profiles 
of 
those 
particles 
at 
a 
given 
determine 
what 
their 
probability-profiles 
will 
be 
at 
a 
later 
time, 
assuming 
no 
outside 
interference, 
of 
course. 


Dr. 
K: 
Precisely. 


Max: 
So 
that 
system’s 
state 
at 
t 
is 
completely 
defined 
by 
the 
values 
of 
the 
relevant 
state-variables 
of 
the 
particles 
composing 
that 
system, 
and 
those 
state-variables 
are 
the 
probability-profiles 
of 
those 
particles. 



Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
Max: 
And 
relative 
to 
that 
conception 
of 
what 
defines 
that 
system’s 
state, 


that 
system’s 
state 
at 
given 
time 
determines 
its 
state 
at 
a 
later. 
Dr. 
K: 
But 
it 
doesn’t 
stop 
there. 
Max: 
How 
do 
you 
mean? 
Dr. 
K: 
After 
thus 
revising 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
state-variable, 
we 
must 


corresondingly 
revise 
the 
concept 
of 
location 
in 
space-time. 
Max: 
I 
see. 
We 
must 
revise 
it 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
these 
new 
entities 
of 


ours---these 
probability-distributions—have 
determinate 
locations. 
Dr. 
K: 
Exactly. 
Max: 
And 
this, 
Dr. 
K, 
might 
be 
a 
good 
stopping 
point. 
Dr. 
K: 
I 
agree. 
See 
you 
tomorrow, 
Max.
