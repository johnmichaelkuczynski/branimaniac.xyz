Quantum 
Determinism

The 
state 
of 
a 
subatomic 
particle 
cannot 
be 
known 
with 
complete 
precision. 
But 
we 
can 
know 
what 
a 
given 
such 
particle’s 
various 
possible 
states 
are 
at 
a 
given; 
and 
if 
we 
have 
this 
information, 
we 
can 
determine 
what 
its 
various 
possible 
states 
are 
at 
a 
later 
time. 


Question: 
In 
light 
of 
these 
facts, 
how 
are 
to 
answer 
the 
question: 
Is 
the 
subatomic 
real 
deterministic? 
One 
possible 
answer 
is: 
It 
may 
be 
that, 
in 
and 
of 
itself, 
the 
sub-atomic 
world 
is 
deterministic; 
but 
operationally 
speaking---in 
other 
words, 
as 
far 
science 
is 
concerned---the 
subatomic 
world 
is 
indeterministic, 
given 
the 
inherently 
probabilistic 
nature 
of 
our 
knowledge 
of 
it. 


But 
there 
is 
another 
possible 
answer. 
It 
may 
be 
that, 
operationally 
speaking, 
the 
behavior 
of 
subatomic 
particles 
is 
indeterministic; 
but 
the 
behavior 
of 
the 
corresponding 
probability-classes 
is 
deterministic, 
where 
a 
probability-class 
is 
the 
class 
of 
a 
given 
sub-particles 
possible 
states 
at 
a 
given 
time. 
In 
other 
words, 
if 
we 
know 
what 
a 
given 
particle’s 
possible 
states 
at 
a 
given 
time 
are, 
then 
we 
can 
know 
what 
its 
possible 
states 
are 
at 
later 
times. 
So 
if 
the 
relevant 
parameter 
is 
taken 
to 
be 
particle 
state, 
then 
the 
sub-atomic 
universe 
is 
indeterministic; 
but 
the 
subatomic 
universe 
is 
deterministic 
if 
the 
relevant 
parameter 
is 
taken 
to 
be 
class 
of 
possible 
particle 
states. 
So 
the 
quantum 
universe 
is 
indeterministic 
relative 
to 
one 
choice 
of 
parameters 
but 
deterministic 
relative 
to 
some 
other 
choice 
of 
parameters. 


Is 
this 
response 
satisfactory? 
Short 
answer: 
No. 
Long 
answer: 
Yes. 
The 
short 
answer 
explained: 
classes 
of 
possible 
states 
do 
not 
have 
causal 
properties; 
such 
classes 
are 
abstract 
objects 
and 
therefore 
do 
not 
cause 
anything 
to 
happen. 
So 
they 
cannot 
be 
said 
to 
be 
causally 
responsible 
for 
one 
another 
and 
are 
a 
priori 
incapable 
of 
being 
constituents 
of 
deterministic 
mechanisms. 


The 
long 
answer 
explained: 
Given 
that 
the 
interactions 
of 
such 
possible 
state-
classes 
can 
be 
predicted, 
it 
follows 
that 
there 
are 
underlying 
deterministic 
mechanisms. 
Those 
state 
classes, 
though 
not 
themselves 
causally 
effective, 
are 
reflections 
of 
underlying 
causal 
mechanisms; 
and 
if 
those 
underlying 



causal 
mechanisms 
were 
indeterministic, 
then 
interrelations 
among 
those 
state 
classes 
would 
be 
correspondingly 
indeterministic. 
Since 
the 
latter 
are 
deterministic, 
so 
are 
the 
former.
