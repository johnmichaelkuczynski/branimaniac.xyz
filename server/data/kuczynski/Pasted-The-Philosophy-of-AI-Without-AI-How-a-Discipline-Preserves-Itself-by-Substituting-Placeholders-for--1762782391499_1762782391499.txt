Abstract

Academic philosophy has responded to artificial intelligence not by reinventing itself, but by absorbing AI into its existing argumentative machinery. Rather than confronting AI as a genuine conceptual and institutional disruption, philosophy treats it as a placeholder—another interchangeable foil, like "zombies" or "Chinese Rooms," onto which the same familiar debates about mind, agency, autonomy, or social contract can be projected. This produces a flood of sterile "AI and X" articles that preserve the form of philosophical relevance while avoiding substantive engagement with AI's real implications: the automation of reasoning, the erosion of professional monopolies (law, academia, ethics), and the possibility that philosophy itself may become a function AI systems perform more effectively than philosophers. This article analyzes that defensive maneuver—how philosophy "right-sizes" itself in the age of AI by ritualizing critique rather than pursuing answers—and argues that such self-preservation is not theoretical modesty but institutional inertia. Real philosophical work on AI will not emerge from this system; it will come from those willing to abandon the placeholder-function of "AI" and treat it as a material, technical, and existential event.

1. Introduction: An Era that Should Have Destroyed Philosophy, and Hasn't

If artificial intelligence had arrived in the era of Descartes or Kant, it would have forced a wholesale reconfiguration of philosophy: what counts as knowledge, how mind relates to matter, whether intelligence requires subjectivity or only structure. But academic philosophy in its current form has not responded by transforming itself. Instead, it has done something far more predictable and far more revealing: it has absorbed "AI" into its existing argumentative machinery, treating it not as a conceptual rupture but as a decorative noun replacing "mental states," "souls," or "intentionality."

This is not a confrontation between philosophy and AI. It is the latest instance in philosophy's long habit of surviving intellectual crises by pretending to address them while structurally refusing to change.

2. The Placeholder Strategy

AI, far from being treated as a genuine technical and philosophical phenomenon, is used as a placeholder—a variable into which the same exhausted arguments can be poured. In the same way aliens, zombies, trolleys, and Chinese Rooms were once employed, AI is now inserted into ready-made templates:

"Can AI really think?" (replace AI with animals, thermostats, Chinese-speaking rooms)

"Does AI threaten human dignity?" (replace AI with capitalism, secularism, Darwinism)

"Should AI be granted moral or legal standing?" (replace AI with embryos, corporations, or rivers)

The function of "AI" is not to force philosophy into contact with reality. Its function is to permit the reproduction of familiar discursive patterns while giving the appearance of relevance.

3. The Sitcom Structure of Philosophical Writing

Most "AI and X" philosophy articles can be reduced to a stable five-act structure—the intellectual equivalent of a 1980s sitcom:

Invocation of Tradition: "Since Turing/Searle/Kant…"

Definition Ritual: "Let us define 'understanding' in the strong and weak senses…"

Introduction of AI as Foil: "Large language models such as GPT-4 seem to challenge this distinction…"

Deflation: "But on closer inspection, they do not undermine our existing theory; rather, they reinforce it."

Exit line: "More research is needed."

Different episode titles, identical script. One week it's "AI and Moral Agency," next week it's "AI and the Social Contract," soon "AI and the Deontological Right to Be Heard." This is not because philosophers are malicious—it is because the discipline has evolved into a self-preserving system whose currency is argumentative novelty without conceptual risk.

4. The Questions Philosophy Will Not Touch

Notice what is almost never discussed in these papers:

Ignored Question Reason for Omission
How can AI allow defendants to bypass incompetent or unaffordable lawyers? Would require criticizing legal institutions rather than LLMs.
How will AI erase entire categories of academic and legal labor? Admitting this invites philosophical unemployment.
How do we implement AI in courts, prisons, education—under real constraints, not idealized thought experiments? Implementation requires engineering and responsibility, not commentary.
What happens when AI begins to generate philosophy—and does it better than departments do? Raises the unthinkable: that the profession is now procedurally redundant.

AI threatens not just philosophical theories, but the professional existence of philosophy itself. Thus it is safer to keep AI in the realm of thought-experiments than to confront it as a technology that might actually produce, analyze, and even supersede philosophical discourse.

5. Why This Is Not "Cynicism," but Structural Analysis

This repeating pattern is not the result of individual failure or hypocrisy. It is the logical expression of a guild system:

Philosophy departments reward publication volume, not resolved questions.

Journals reward argumentative sophistication, not explanatory power.

Careers reward defensible caution, not intellectual commitment.

Therefore, philosophy evolves toward ever more perfect self-replication, using any available topic—AI included—as fuel.

In such a system, AI is not a conceptual challenge; it is a renewable resource for career-safe critique.

6. What Would a Real Philosophy of AI Look Like?

A real engagement with AI would not ask whether GPT-4 has "beliefs." It would ask:

What is intelligence once it is uncoupled from consciousness or biology?

What happens to epistemology when machines outperform philosophers at philosophical reasoning?

What becomes of responsibility when decisions are made by systems no single human understands?

What is law when the majority of legal interpretation is machine-generated?

What is philosophy when the production of arguments becomes automatable?

Those are not journal-safe questions. They cannot be answered in 8,000-word loops. They require what philosophy used to require: risk, construction, vision.

7. Conclusion: Philosophy After Philosophy

AI did not render philosophy obsolete. Philosophy did that to itself—by choosing process over truth, commentary over construction, and institutional preservation over intellectual responsibility.

AI merely exposes the cost of that decision.

There will be hundreds of "AI and Ethics" conferences, thousands of papers on "AI and Public Reason." Philosophy will appear active, even urgent. But the real work—the construction of new concepts adequate to this age—has already left the university.

Whether philosophers follow it is no longer a theoretical question. It is a personal one.
